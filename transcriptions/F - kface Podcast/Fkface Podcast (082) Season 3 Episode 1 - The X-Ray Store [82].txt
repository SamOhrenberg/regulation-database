[00:35.930 --> 00:37.170]  Why'd you post that?
[00:37.170 --> 00:43.950]  Why'd I put- because I was talking about partially is Imhotep a bad guy to Nick, and then Geoff joined in.
[00:44.330 --> 00:49.170]  And they brought up some points that I feel like are probably fair, and I'm not saying that he isn't a bad guy,
[00:49.270 --> 00:53.830]  I just don't remember what his plans were beyond saving his girlfriend.
[00:54.730 --> 00:58.270]  Nick said that he killed a lot of people, and I was like, he killed 6 people.
[00:58.390 --> 01:02.170]  That's really not that many in the grand scheme of, like, evil movie villains.
[01:02.250 --> 01:03.230]  You know what, though?
[01:03.950 --> 01:04.070]  What?
[01:04.070 --> 01:04.650]  You know what, though?
[01:05.010 --> 01:05.530]  I'd love to know.
[01:05.530 --> 01:08.830]  A lot, a lot of property damage with those storms.
[01:09.630 --> 01:10.610]  Those sandstorms?
[01:11.390 --> 01:13.510]  Millions of dollars of property damage.
[01:13.610 --> 01:20.110]  You cannot do- like, you can't make that point while the Marvel movies exist, and the Avengers- like, that.
[01:20.590 --> 01:21.530]  There is no-
[01:22.230 --> 01:26.050]  6 people is tremendously bad still.
[01:26.670 --> 01:29.270]  There's not a lot worse than killing 6 people.
[01:29.910 --> 01:30.510]  No, it's terrible.
[01:30.510 --> 01:31.390]  Think about the people that were displaced.
[01:31.690 --> 01:34.150]  He may have displaced 10,000 people from their homes.
[01:34.150 --> 01:44.670]  How many people are gonna die of disease and malnutrition over the course of the next decade because their livelihoods got destroyed because of his nonsense?
[01:44.870 --> 01:46.470]  You have to think about the after effects.
[01:46.890 --> 01:50.630]  Terminator, he comes up, and he'll kill 70, 80 people, and then he's out.
[01:51.050 --> 01:57.870]  A guy like Imhotep comes up, he may kill 6 people today, but he might kill 100,000 people over the course of the next fucking 10 years.
[01:58.210 --> 02:03.270]  He was also trying to raise an army of dogs at one point, which I'm sure killed quite a lot of people.
[02:03.270 --> 02:10.290]  He was just a big dog guy. He knew where the internet was headed, he wanted to get ahead of the curve, he wanted the dogs.
[02:10.610 --> 02:12.270]  Tell Geoff what you said about Imhotep earlier.
[02:12.770 --> 02:14.490]  What did I say about Imhotep earlier?
[02:15.110 --> 02:15.830]  You said-
[02:15.830 --> 02:31.850]  Oh, it's the John- Imhotep is the John Wick of Egypt. Like, he was just minding his own business, he was dead, and then some people came in and woke him up, stole his shit, and then he specifically kills those people to get his body back.
[02:31.850 --> 02:34.270]  John Wick wasn't trying to resurrect corpses.
[02:34.650 --> 02:43.410]  No, but John Wick was a guy who was living his life, and then some fucking idiots came in and killed his dog, and brought him back into the game.
[02:43.810 --> 02:52.890]  Here's the difference. He went and wanted to get revenge. He didn't- he could've tried to resurrect that dog from the dead, but he chose not to.
[02:53.050 --> 02:59.410]  He chose not to go down the supernatural evil route, and instead, he enacted completely believable revenge.
[02:59.410 --> 03:09.050]  I understand it's not one-to-one, but my point is that these were both people that were just living their lives, and then were thrust into the story of what happened by others.
[03:09.270 --> 03:14.970]  I feel like most- most movies start with something happening to a character.
[03:17.010 --> 03:24.270]  No, I'm not- you're taking such the wrong point from this. Not every movie starts with somebody doing something to that character.
[03:25.170 --> 03:30.770]  There are movies where people are like, I'm gonna fucking solve this. I'm gonna do this. Like, there's a point where they're-
[03:30.770 --> 03:36.170]  I- I actually- I actually have one that I think is in similar vein to what you're saying, that has always stuck out to me.
[03:36.490 --> 03:36.670]  Okay.
[03:36.790 --> 03:40.310]  Did you guys ever watch the TV show, uh, The Walking Dead?
[03:40.690 --> 03:41.030]  Yes.
[03:41.530 --> 03:43.650]  Do you remember the whole Negan-
[03:43.650 --> 03:44.330]  I do.
[03:44.990 --> 03:53.110]  Where the- he was like the big, bad, evil guy, he had the baseball bat, uh, named, I don't know, Nadine or Geraldine or something, Francine.
[03:53.470 --> 03:56.030]  The comedian was Francine. Yes, it was the comedian.
[03:56.610 --> 04:00.490]  It was Negan, Geoffrey Dean- Geoffrey Dean Morgan. Yeah, the comedian from Watchmen.
[04:00.830 --> 04:03.910]  Anyway, he's like the bad guy, wears a leather jacket, fucking kills people left and right.
[04:04.590 --> 04:10.690]  He was on Howard Stern once, and Howard was asking him, like, how do you prepare for a role of being such an evil bad guy?
[04:11.010 --> 04:14.130]  And he looked at Howard and he was like, I, uh, I don't think I'm a bad guy.
[04:14.570 --> 04:19.370]  And Howard's like, what? And he goes, I'm serious, I, I am living a life with my people, trying to keep my people alive,
[04:19.510 --> 04:25.210]  and this goddamn Rick and his buddies keep showing up and stealing our stuff and killing people and raiding us,
[04:25.370 --> 04:28.670]  so we're just defending ourselves. And then, you know, I don't want to be pushed around,
[04:28.890 --> 04:31.350]  so if somebody's gonna come and fuck with me, I'm gonna fuck with them twice as hard.
[04:31.690 --> 04:37.410]  I'm the protagonist of my story, they're the bad guys. And I, that really made me sit and think for a while.
[04:37.670 --> 04:40.350]  I feel like every actor who plays a villain says that.
[04:40.350 --> 04:45.510]  I feel like that's universal, of like, I'm playing, actually, to play this villainous character,
[04:45.650 --> 04:49.170]  I need to somehow convince myself that they are the hero of the story.
[04:49.510 --> 04:54.910]  Yeah. You know who is the other, if, if Geoffrey Dean Morgan turned down Deegan, do you know who's gonna get it?
[04:55.050 --> 04:59.350]  Who was second? No. He had the job for 20 minutes, apparently, and then Geoffrey Dean Morgan was like,
[04:59.390 --> 05:03.270]  no, I want to do it, so he got it. Matthew Lillard would have been the villain.
[05:04.430 --> 05:07.970]  I'm not even, I'm not kidding. He would have played it like a 90s psycho.
[05:07.970 --> 05:14.190]  He did like three auditions for it, I think, and they're like, yeah, if he would have said no, you would have been Deegan.
[05:14.370 --> 05:19.630]  And I, I can't imagine what that would have looked like, but I would like to see it. It's just so odd.
[05:19.890 --> 05:25.570]  I wouldn't, the last time I saw Matthew Lillard, the last time I saw Matthew Lillard would have been around the same time period,
[05:25.710 --> 05:29.110]  with that Twin Peaks reboot, or not reboot, sorry, but the new Twin Peaks season.
[05:29.530 --> 05:33.030]  And I can't imagine that guy in Twin Peaks being scary.
[05:35.270 --> 05:39.170]  Or intimidating, or... I mean, he was the bad guy in Scream.
[05:39.630 --> 05:43.690]  Yeah, he was, yeah, sort of. One of, yeah.
[05:44.130 --> 05:46.870]  So it's not like out of character to play a, you know, psychopath.
[05:47.390 --> 05:53.530]  But he, like the, the vibe is so different, Deegan, to who he played in Scream and like who he typically played.
[05:53.590 --> 05:59.330]  Like he just sort of plays like an idiot in Scream that is just, you never really get into his motivations for it.
[05:59.330 --> 06:04.590]  He's just kind of a guy where Negan is intimidating physically in a different way.
[06:04.790 --> 06:10.210]  Yeah, Matthew Lillard is, except for maybe Twin Peaks, he's never, well even then, he's never not silly.
[06:10.730 --> 06:13.490]  You know what I mean? It's hard to take him seriously.
[06:13.830 --> 06:16.950]  I'm trying to think. He's got that, he's got that like natural humor about him.
[06:17.230 --> 06:24.610]  The Descendants. That's the only role I can think of where he's not, he's just a guy that is cheating with George Clooney's wife.
[06:25.130 --> 06:26.590]  We're a Matthew Lillard podcast.
[06:26.590 --> 06:30.130]  What episode is this? Oh my god, what episode is this?
[06:30.650 --> 06:31.170]  82? 83?
[06:31.850 --> 06:38.530]  Oh, so interesting, this is 82 according to Nick. Do you guys know the significance of episode 82?
[06:38.870 --> 06:40.450]  I just, I just realized it yesterday.
[06:40.790 --> 06:42.850]  No. Uh, no.
[06:43.170 --> 06:46.230]  Episode 82, we missed, we missed a bit of a milestone.
[06:46.850 --> 06:53.470]  Episode 82 is, I believe, the second episode of season three of F***face.
[06:54.130 --> 06:55.610]  We, we had a season shift?
[06:55.610 --> 06:58.030]  No, we don't, no, that's not how it works.
[06:58.030 --> 07:07.870]  Season, no, yeah, it is how it works. Season one ended at episode 40, season two began at episode 41, which would mean that season two ended at episode 80 and season three began at 81.
[07:08.370 --> 07:09.470]  I'm gonna challenge this.
[07:09.750 --> 07:12.810]  I feel like this season extends to the end of the redemption year.
[07:13.110 --> 07:17.630]  I feel like this season, I feel like at the time, the conversation was related to...
[07:17.630 --> 07:21.150]  Well, if we're gonna, if we're gonna wait for full redemption, season two's gonna go on forever.
[07:21.750 --> 07:21.930]  No.
[07:21.930 --> 07:23.930]  Well, season one is always shorter than season two.
[07:23.930 --> 07:32.730]  There is an argument, so this is, I think what started this conversation was looking at seasons on Disney Plus and how nonsensical it is.
[07:32.950 --> 07:38.170]  We're like, season one will be 72 episodes of DuckTales and season two will be 16.
[07:38.630 --> 07:46.090]  Like, I don't think we need to follow a specific, so what you're saying is that we're two episodes longer than season one at this point.
[07:46.190 --> 07:48.130]  I'll tell you, I'll tell you what I'm saying, because I agree with you.
[07:48.130 --> 07:57.670]  I think there's something to that. Let's then just say, because it makes no sense whatsoever, which is very f***facey of us, that this is the first episode of season three, year two.
[07:58.170 --> 07:58.590]  Oh, f***face.
[08:00.150 --> 08:00.550]  Okay.
[08:01.330 --> 08:01.670]  Okay?
[08:02.030 --> 08:05.330]  But still, so the redemption year goes across multiple seasons.
[08:06.550 --> 08:09.670]  That's, it's not a redemption season, Gavin, it's a redemption year.
[08:09.910 --> 08:11.270]  Yeah, that's fine, I'm just clarifying.
[08:11.290 --> 08:13.010]  A season's not a year and a year is not a season.
[08:13.350 --> 08:17.570]  If f***face was a TV series and it was structured this way, I would hate it.
[08:17.570 --> 08:25.190]  I would hate watching f***face in their season format. It'd be horrendous. It'd make no sense. It'd be terrible.
[08:25.750 --> 08:30.090]  I'd like to play a clip, just, you know, while we're doing some housekeeping talking about the show.
[08:30.090 --> 08:37.270]  This is, whenever Gavin says, I would like to play a clip, I'm terrified, probably because 80% of the time it's been related to me.
[08:37.430 --> 08:41.490]  I don't know if you feel the same way, Geoff, but it is intimidating whenever Gavin says, I'm gonna play a clip.
[08:41.770 --> 08:42.270]  You may not like this clip.
[08:42.270 --> 08:45.970]  Do I feel intimidated that 80% of the time it's making fun of you?
[08:46.170 --> 08:46.470]  No.
[08:46.470 --> 08:50.070]  No, but I'm saying, well, I feel like I misspelled something probably.
[08:50.610 --> 08:53.190]  Um, I feel like, uh, last week, this was two weeks ago.
[08:53.570 --> 08:58.070]  Um, Geoff made a joke during a discussion about the number 80.
[08:58.470 --> 09:01.110]  And then I feel like I didn't really hear it at the time.
[09:01.210 --> 09:06.270]  I feel like Andrew never understood that it was a joke and just carried on the conversation.
[09:06.510 --> 09:08.070]  See if this makes any sense to you, Andrew.
[09:08.330 --> 09:08.630]  Okay.
[09:08.790 --> 09:10.430]  I think there is. We just need to sit down and figure it out.
[09:10.490 --> 09:13.710]  We're approaching a number of episodes that no one can pitch in baseball.
[09:14.330 --> 09:15.010]  That's true.
[09:16.630 --> 09:17.350]  I think...
[09:17.350 --> 09:21.110]  What's the fastest pitch recorded? It's probably in like over 100.
[09:21.130 --> 09:22.710]  I think, uh, I want to say 102.
[09:23.810 --> 09:26.990]  Really? I was thinking, I was going to guess like 110 would be my guess.
[09:27.310 --> 09:28.250]  No, I don't think that high.
[09:28.710 --> 09:30.050]  Has anyone thrown one in a vacuum?
[09:31.070 --> 09:31.850]  What do you mean?
[09:33.390 --> 09:35.170]  Like, has anyone thrown one at a vacuum cleaner?
[09:37.090 --> 09:39.810]  I don't understand, like, why? Why would they have done that?
[09:40.350 --> 09:42.550]  Well, it says no air resistance, so you can throw it real fast.
[09:43.150 --> 09:44.090]  Oh, okay.
[09:44.090 --> 09:48.890]  I feel like you took some leaps there. I wasn't with you. I was lost.
[09:49.570 --> 09:54.410]  I was thinking about, I've never seen someone throw a vacuum. There was a guy who got...
[09:54.410 --> 09:55.670]  Like, what do you think we're talking about?
[09:55.670 --> 09:58.450]  Okay, no, no, I know. No, no, no, I have an answer for that.
[09:58.710 --> 10:01.750]  I have an answer for that. I remember that moment distinctly.
[10:02.410 --> 10:05.930]  I was confused by what you were saying from the jump.
[10:06.190 --> 10:09.510]  As soon as you said, like, I didn't know where you're going from vacuum.
[10:09.990 --> 10:11.890]  Like, I didn't expect a literal vacuum.
[10:11.890 --> 10:15.390]  I didn't understand the point you were trying to make from the beginning.
[10:15.650 --> 10:20.330]  So as somebody who didn't understand what was going on, I was just like, I'm going to play along with whatever.
[10:20.710 --> 10:23.130]  Because I don't know what the road is. I don't see where we're headed.
[10:23.430 --> 10:31.210]  Because I feel like you came away from that conversation either thinking that we were throwing a baseball at a vacuum cleaner or throwing a vacuum cleaner.
[10:31.290 --> 10:33.630]  And I couldn't figure out what you'd take away from that.
[10:33.630 --> 10:38.830]  No, I didn't take anything away from any of it. I was just playing into whatever was being said.
[10:39.090 --> 10:41.210]  I understood that you didn't literally need a vacuum.
[10:41.210 --> 10:46.830]  I tell you where this is going. This is going to our new... I'm excited about this.
[10:47.170 --> 10:51.110]  This is going to our new sporting event that we're going to start.
[10:51.250 --> 10:55.350]  It's not the Olympics. It's not track and field. It's vac and field.
[10:55.750 --> 11:00.190]  We're going to throw vacuum cleaners like we're throwing a discus and see who can throw it the farthest.
[11:00.430 --> 11:04.210]  And then we're going to throw shit at vacuum cleaners and see who's the most accurate.
[11:04.450 --> 11:08.230]  And then we'll come up with some other vac and field activities. This is going to be awesome.
[11:08.770 --> 11:12.410]  I thought you were going a different way. I thought baseball with only vacuums.
[11:12.770 --> 11:16.310]  Like everybody who's pitching has to launch the ball.
[11:16.810 --> 11:19.930]  Okay. That's perfect. Vac and field. I can't wait. 2022.
[11:20.570 --> 11:22.670]  Okay, so you were just sort of going with the flow.
[11:23.130 --> 11:27.170]  I was totally going with the flow because I didn't necessarily understand your original point.
[11:27.330 --> 11:29.450]  So I was just like, wherever we go, I'm just going to buy into it.
[11:29.570 --> 11:32.850]  And I remember saying at the time, or thinking at the time while I was saying it,
[11:32.890 --> 11:37.090]  I know we're not talking about actual vacuums, but I don't know what else to do here.
[11:37.090 --> 11:38.150]  So I'm just going to keep talking.
[11:38.650 --> 11:40.810]  Let me ask another question to that answer.
[11:41.090 --> 11:43.970]  How often would you say that happens to you through the recording of this podcast?
[11:45.150 --> 11:46.890]  You know, it depends. Not often.
[11:47.070 --> 11:51.570]  Do you think you follow 70% of what's happening?
[11:51.670 --> 11:54.510]  Oh, definitely. Yeah, I follow a lot more than it appears.
[11:55.070 --> 12:00.250]  I wish I could say it was less. It would explain some of my responses better.
[12:00.690 --> 12:05.990]  But I have to just own up to that. The fact that I am listening 90% of the time.
[12:05.990 --> 12:07.650]  90, my ass.
[12:07.990 --> 12:09.270]  No, I'll get lost sometimes.
[12:09.330 --> 12:12.830]  I would say you're listening 80% and you're comprehending 50%.
[12:12.830 --> 12:19.190]  The guy that interrupts me every fucking 6 minutes is going to come at me for listening once again.
[12:19.650 --> 12:20.550]  It's outrageous.
[12:21.590 --> 12:22.570]  How dare you?
[12:23.350 --> 12:23.870]  Outrageous.
[12:25.450 --> 12:27.730]  I'd take this from Geoff if I'd take it from you.
[12:27.910 --> 12:29.830]  You are so full of shit with listening.
[12:30.670 --> 12:31.890]  You think I don't listen?
[12:32.230 --> 12:34.070]  Well, you talk over me 80%.
[12:34.970 --> 12:37.990]  There's two options, Gavin. I either need to believe you're not listening.
[12:38.310 --> 12:44.350]  Or you care so little about what I'm saying most of the time that you just decide that whatever you're saying is more important.
[12:44.670 --> 12:46.290]  So I'm going to choose that you're not listening.
[12:46.770 --> 12:49.710]  I will say, if we were in the same room, I wouldn't interrupt you as much.
[12:49.950 --> 12:54.210]  It's mainly a Discord thing. An internet thing. I've got bad internet.
[12:54.610 --> 12:56.750]  You do. But that's less fun.
[12:57.330 --> 13:00.090]  Can I donate some money or something to help you get better internet?
[13:01.990 --> 13:03.410]  Is that possible? Can we do that?
[13:04.110 --> 13:05.810]  I feel like that's a thing that can be done.
[13:06.710 --> 13:08.150]  How do we improve your internet?
[13:09.850 --> 13:11.250]  Anything else you need to improve, Gavin?
[13:11.410 --> 13:13.370]  Do we stop at internet? What else do you need?
[13:13.650 --> 13:14.450]  Do you need a new blender?
[13:15.470 --> 13:17.650]  Do you need an appliance of some kind?
[13:17.650 --> 13:19.030]  What's deficient in your life?
[13:19.050 --> 13:20.730]  A vacuum? What are you lacking?
[13:22.190 --> 13:23.270]  I need a new Swiffer.
[13:23.690 --> 13:24.970]  I'll just say that right now.
[13:25.790 --> 13:26.890]  That's something I need.
[13:27.370 --> 13:28.770]  Product I'm lacking. You need a Swiffer?
[13:29.930 --> 13:30.810]  My wall.
[13:31.490 --> 13:34.230]  Back of my wall. I guess I don't need a Swiffer for that.
[13:34.610 --> 13:39.270]  I've had such a bad run of dropping things since we've last...
[13:39.270 --> 13:40.210]  It just keeps happening.
[13:41.110 --> 13:42.470]  Something went on your wall?
[13:43.290 --> 13:47.290]  I probably should have led to that later for the story.
[13:47.410 --> 13:48.750]  The best version of the story is revealed later.
[13:48.750 --> 13:49.650]  Are we in the middle of a story?
[13:50.130 --> 13:53.370]  We're sort of at the end of the funniest part of the story.
[13:53.530 --> 13:54.830]  I dropped a milkshake.
[13:57.270 --> 13:58.970]  Let's just pretend that part didn't happen.
[13:59.170 --> 14:00.250]  We're just going to pretend it didn't happen.
[14:00.250 --> 14:02.030]  So I bought a milkshake.
[14:02.130 --> 14:04.070]  I got food over the weekend.
[14:04.590 --> 14:05.110]  Last weekend.
[14:05.250 --> 14:06.510]  It's always good to get food.
[14:06.890 --> 14:08.870]  So I had a milkshake, which I've never had.
[14:09.030 --> 14:11.050]  I've never experienced a milkshake.
[14:11.190 --> 14:12.630]  You know what? I'm going to have a...
[14:13.210 --> 14:14.810]  You started in the middle of the story.
[14:15.230 --> 14:16.050]  You went back to the beginning.
[14:16.550 --> 14:21.750]  I feel like a little bit too early by saying you bought some food at the weekend.
[14:22.170 --> 14:22.790]  That's a given.
[14:22.790 --> 14:25.230]  You could go straight to what you bought.
[14:25.390 --> 14:26.570]  No, I think it's different.
[14:26.690 --> 14:28.230]  I think contextually it's important.
[14:30.250 --> 14:36.130]  I feel like it's more painful if I physically went to a place, got it, then brought it.
[14:36.210 --> 14:37.610]  I only ordered food.
[14:37.950 --> 14:38.710]  Had it delivered.
[14:39.150 --> 14:40.090]  Made it to my door.
[14:40.630 --> 14:41.690]  Walking up the stairs.
[14:42.070 --> 14:42.990]  I get to my doorway.
[14:43.150 --> 14:43.910]  I drop it.
[14:44.410 --> 14:47.210]  And it hits at an angle where it explodes on impact.
[14:47.390 --> 14:48.750]  It covers the door.
[14:48.750 --> 14:51.790]  Once again, it's Geoff's smoothie problem.
[14:52.170 --> 14:54.330]  It's like the fourth time this has happened to me recently.
[14:54.750 --> 14:55.610]  All over the door.
[14:55.750 --> 14:56.370]  Over the wall.
[14:56.750 --> 14:59.150]  I didn't end up drinking any of it.
[14:59.770 --> 15:00.690]  I cleaned it.
[15:01.050 --> 15:02.530]  I'm laying in bed the next day.
[15:02.610 --> 15:04.250]  And I look up and I have Oreo on my wall.
[15:04.650 --> 15:06.450]  I didn't realize how far it exploded.
[15:06.890 --> 15:09.330]  I have pieces of Oreo all over my back wall.
[15:09.630 --> 15:10.590]  Cleaned up most of it.
[15:10.690 --> 15:11.670]  Some of it is so high up.
[15:11.770 --> 15:13.030]  I would love to have a Swiffer.
[15:13.830 --> 15:14.750]  Use the stick.
[15:14.750 --> 15:16.530]  Is this the one...
[15:16.530 --> 15:18.310]  Because you dropped one recently, didn't you?
[15:18.370 --> 15:21.430]  That was made a lot worse by you picking it up or something.
[15:21.710 --> 15:23.490]  Oh, that was the Burger King soda.
[15:24.250 --> 15:25.990]  Well, this was a Burger King milkshake.
[15:26.290 --> 15:26.650]  I am...
[15:26.650 --> 15:30.110]  If I order Burger King, I am dropping the drink that's with it.
[15:30.550 --> 15:32.130]  And it is going everywhere.
[15:33.270 --> 15:33.970]  This hasn't...
[15:33.970 --> 15:34.170]  Okay.
[15:35.330 --> 15:37.230]  On Sunday, I ordered food again.
[15:37.790 --> 15:38.670]  I ordered food from a different place.
[15:38.670 --> 15:40.090]  Wait, two days in a row you ate?
[15:40.510 --> 15:42.970]  No, I think it was like middle of the week.
[15:42.970 --> 15:44.190]  The days don't matter.
[15:44.310 --> 15:45.510]  The point is...
[15:45.510 --> 15:47.070]  Keep telling us the days.
[15:48.230 --> 15:51.870]  The next time I ordered food, I ordered Japanese food.
[15:52.290 --> 15:53.570]  And I was very excited about it.
[15:54.030 --> 15:54.570]  It was great.
[15:54.870 --> 15:57.010]  But I am nervous because I keep dropping shit.
[15:57.190 --> 15:57.810]  So I am like, fuck.
[15:58.570 --> 16:00.730]  This is a terrifying existence I am in.
[16:01.090 --> 16:03.310]  So I get my sushi.
[16:03.530 --> 16:04.350]  I order sushi.
[16:05.270 --> 16:06.130]  And that's it.
[16:06.330 --> 16:07.550]  It's hard to fuck up sushi.
[16:07.810 --> 16:09.170]  I have sushi. It's in a bag.
[16:09.170 --> 16:10.630]  Why did you order it with a question mark?
[16:10.930 --> 16:12.950]  Because I was trying to think if I ordered other things.
[16:13.210 --> 16:15.330]  That was me trying to process.
[16:15.510 --> 16:16.190]  I ordered sushi.
[16:16.830 --> 16:19.530]  I get my sushi. I walk it all the way up to my room.
[16:19.770 --> 16:22.170]  I place it on my bed to remove it from the bag.
[16:22.250 --> 16:23.050]  I sit at my desk chair.
[16:23.370 --> 16:23.830]  Turn around.
[16:24.450 --> 16:25.970]  Go to grab it from the bag.
[16:26.630 --> 16:27.830]  The bag...
[16:27.830 --> 16:31.590]  The container fucking opens.
[16:31.890 --> 16:32.870]  Not even all the way.
[16:33.130 --> 16:34.310]  It partially opens.
[16:34.690 --> 16:36.210]  All of the sushi falls out.
[16:37.650 --> 16:38.370]  All of it.
[16:38.410 --> 16:40.430]  I got it to my room on the bed.
[16:40.510 --> 16:41.850]  I'm lifting it out of the bag on the bed.
[16:41.970 --> 16:44.390]  I had a bag of fucking sushi.
[16:44.450 --> 16:46.690]  It was just a sushi bag.
[16:48.470 --> 16:50.730]  That's the saddest thing I've ever seen.
[16:52.930 --> 16:55.190]  It was truly terrible.
[16:55.570 --> 16:56.290]  It was sad.
[16:56.830 --> 16:58.610]  I had like four rolls on my bed.
[16:58.870 --> 17:00.930]  And then the rest all went to a bag.
[17:01.070 --> 17:03.350]  And the lid didn't even fully pop off.
[17:04.050 --> 17:05.430]  And I just sat there.
[17:05.430 --> 17:07.490]  I just sat there dejected saying,
[17:07.810 --> 17:09.210]  How? How did this happen?
[17:09.770 --> 17:10.450]  How did this happen?
[17:10.910 --> 17:11.810]  Did you still eat them?
[17:12.210 --> 17:13.330]  Oh, I absolutely did.
[17:13.390 --> 17:14.550]  That's what the box looked like.
[17:14.630 --> 17:16.730]  They all slid out the bottom.
[17:17.010 --> 17:20.130]  They just all slid as soon as I was lifting it out of the bag.
[17:20.290 --> 17:21.330]  What's the green shit?
[17:22.090 --> 17:22.490]  Wasabi.
[17:23.470 --> 17:25.130]  There's so much wasabi.
[17:25.390 --> 17:26.430]  There is a lot of wasabi.
[17:26.990 --> 17:29.650]  I have a feeling it's less than there was, Gavin.
[17:32.430 --> 17:33.370]  But it got everywhere.
[17:33.370 --> 17:34.510]  It was just all over the place.
[17:34.610 --> 17:36.170]  I've never been so sad.
[17:36.310 --> 17:38.490]  And I refused to put it back in the container.
[17:38.670 --> 17:40.370]  So yeah, I ate the sushi out of a bag.
[17:40.470 --> 17:41.670]  I ate bagged sushi.
[17:41.910 --> 17:44.050]  And it was depressing on a different level.
[17:44.150 --> 17:45.370]  You could at least put it on a plate.
[17:45.730 --> 17:48.290]  No, I was so...
[17:48.290 --> 17:50.030]  It was like a punishment for myself
[17:50.030 --> 17:51.530]  because I keep dropping things.
[17:51.550 --> 17:53.190]  You just don't deserve good things.
[17:53.490 --> 17:54.550]  You get bagged sushi.
[17:55.670 --> 17:58.010]  That's like a banana skin for you.
[17:58.410 --> 18:00.030]  Yeah, it is.
[18:01.230 --> 18:02.270]  It was terrible.
[18:03.230 --> 18:03.990]  That's my life.
[18:04.250 --> 18:04.670]  Dropping stuff.
[18:04.750 --> 18:06.270]  Can I throw a sad food thing in?
[18:06.710 --> 18:07.930]  It's not even a real story.
[18:08.090 --> 18:11.330]  I've got nothing to talk about this week.
[18:11.730 --> 18:13.290]  So Gavin,
[18:13.870 --> 18:15.130]  last week I went to
[18:15.790 --> 18:17.030]  what's quickly becoming
[18:17.030 --> 18:19.070]  one of my favorite restaurants in Austin.
[18:19.330 --> 18:21.330]  And I mention it to you because I know you like it a lot too.
[18:21.410 --> 18:22.310]  It's a place called Dip Dip Dip.
[18:22.990 --> 18:24.670]  And they make a...
[18:24.670 --> 18:27.210]  It's a really nice...
[18:27.910 --> 18:28.550]  I forget.
[18:28.710 --> 18:30.830]  It's like fancy hot pot kind of, right?
[18:32.030 --> 18:32.670]  Shabu Shabu.
[18:33.350 --> 18:34.650]  Yeah, there you go. It's fucking awesome.
[18:34.790 --> 18:36.590]  And I fall in love with it and I eat there a bunch now.
[18:37.230 --> 18:38.490]  We went there last week
[18:39.590 --> 18:40.770]  and we're sitting down
[18:40.770 --> 18:42.090]  and we're looking at the menu and they come over
[18:42.090 --> 18:43.610]  and they're giving you the daily specials
[18:43.610 --> 18:46.430]  and I'm already pretty sure I know what I want to get there
[18:46.430 --> 18:48.250]  because I have a routine that I'm into.
[18:48.770 --> 18:50.250]  And then she's like, what would you like to hear the specials?
[18:50.250 --> 18:50.950]  And I'm like, I guess.
[18:51.170 --> 18:53.690]  So she leads off the specials.
[18:53.690 --> 18:54.890]  She goes, and then we have
[18:55.490 --> 18:57.170]  the most amazing
[18:58.030 --> 18:58.910]  two week
[19:00.210 --> 19:01.830]  smoked... and then she said the fucking
[19:01.830 --> 19:03.910]  p-word and I almost threw up
[19:03.910 --> 19:04.190]  in my mouth.
[19:06.110 --> 19:07.830]  And all I could think about
[19:07.830 --> 19:09.890]  all I could think about for the rest of the
[19:09.890 --> 19:11.910]  god damn meal was that two week
[19:11.910 --> 19:13.890]  old smoked p-word was somewhere
[19:13.890 --> 19:15.730]  in the building with me. Like we were
[19:15.730 --> 19:17.910]  co-existing in the same space and people
[19:17.910 --> 19:19.430]  around me were probably eating it
[19:19.430 --> 19:21.830]  and it took everything I had to enjoy the evening
[19:21.830 --> 19:23.830]  because it was like there was a
[19:23.830 --> 19:25.910]  giant p-word sandwich just
[19:25.910 --> 19:27.570]  on my shoulder looking over me and it was
[19:27.570 --> 19:29.870]  terrifying. I bet it was
[19:29.870 --> 19:31.870]  delicious too because everything is good there.
[19:32.010 --> 19:33.430]  Yeah, I'm sure it was delicious.
[19:34.250 --> 19:35.870]  I just like how
[19:35.870 --> 19:38.070]  how far it has fallen for you.
[19:38.690 --> 19:39.670]  Knowing how excited
[19:39.670 --> 19:41.810]  that would have happened to you like eight days
[19:41.810 --> 19:43.990]  prior or however many days before
[19:43.990 --> 19:45.110]  your colonoscopy.
[19:45.430 --> 19:47.790]  That would have been a dream. Dude, it would
[19:47.790 --> 19:49.910]  be like if baseball cards gave me
[19:49.910 --> 19:51.410]  cancer or something, you know?
[19:51.490 --> 19:53.790]  It's like I discovered it and I fell
[19:53.790 --> 19:55.710]  in love with it hard and
[19:55.710 --> 19:57.590]  fast and I immersed
[19:57.590 --> 19:59.930]  fully immersed myself in the p-word
[19:59.930 --> 20:01.470]  world and I really
[20:01.470 --> 20:03.470]  embraced it. I was like
[20:03.470 --> 20:05.810]  eschewing it. I was going on other podcasts
[20:05.810 --> 20:08.090]  to espouse the virtues of p-word
[20:08.090 --> 20:10.070]  like I was so fucking into it
[20:10.070 --> 20:11.930]  and then I got the rug pulled
[20:11.930 --> 20:13.770]  out from under me so hard and so
[20:13.770 --> 20:15.410]  fast. I'm still spinning.
[20:15.750 --> 20:16.550]  It sucks.
[20:17.630 --> 20:18.870]  I've been meaning to ask
[20:18.870 --> 20:20.670]  and thank you for bringing this up. It reminded
[20:20.670 --> 20:22.670]  me. I was curious if you have begun
[20:22.670 --> 20:24.170]  a journey for a new
[20:24.690 --> 20:26.550]  thing to replace that. Maybe
[20:26.550 --> 20:28.650]  in the deli world. Are you just sort of
[20:28.650 --> 20:30.590]  in a place of sadness right now of like
[20:30.590 --> 20:32.550]  processing your loss? I'll be honest.
[20:32.610 --> 20:34.730]  I'm kind of lost in the woods right now. Just in general
[20:34.730 --> 20:36.350]  it's been a rough couple weeks
[20:36.350 --> 20:38.050]  and yeah, I'm just
[20:38.050 --> 20:40.410]  I mean, I don't have the energy to search
[20:40.410 --> 20:42.290]  for a new passion right now to be honest with you.
[20:42.390 --> 20:44.710]  And I bet just all deli mates are similar looking.
[20:45.790 --> 20:46.210]  Yeah.
[20:47.610 --> 20:49.050]  Guilty by association, right?
[20:49.470 --> 20:49.690]  Yeah.
[20:50.450 --> 20:52.690]  You talked about dropping shit. This fucking morning
[20:52.690 --> 20:53.770]  I had a sequence of events.
[20:54.810 --> 20:56.770]  I wanted to smash my head
[20:56.770 --> 20:58.390]  through a fucking brick wall today.
[20:58.710 --> 20:59.410]  I was so frustrated.
[21:00.890 --> 21:02.610]  I got up this morning and I do
[21:02.610 --> 21:04.090]  my morning routine which is
[21:04.680 --> 21:06.610]  the feed the kid, the dogs,
[21:06.850 --> 21:08.670]  the poops, the peas, the get
[21:08.670 --> 21:10.590]  ready, make the lunches, make
[21:10.590 --> 21:12.730]  coffee, the whole thing. And it's fine. I'm a morning
[21:12.730 --> 21:14.590]  person. I'm into it. It's cool. And then like
[21:14.590 --> 21:16.710]  Millie was kind of dragging today a little bit, you know
[21:16.710 --> 21:18.730]  which is fine because we
[21:18.730 --> 21:20.750]  have like a 30 minute window. She likes to get to school a little
[21:20.750 --> 21:22.630]  early to visit with her friends. And so
[21:22.630 --> 21:24.670]  it's not the end of the world, but I had at 10
[21:24.670 --> 21:26.770]  a.m. I had an
[21:26.770 --> 21:28.510]  appointment to get a bunch of x-rays
[21:29.170 --> 21:30.730]  on my body. So that
[21:30.730 --> 21:32.470]  we can figure out why I can't sit anymore.
[21:32.690 --> 21:34.470]  And if I will ever
[21:34.470 --> 21:36.670]  ever be able to ride a bicycle again.
[21:36.990 --> 21:38.510]  Because we're going on about a month now
[21:38.510 --> 21:40.690]  that I haven't gotten any activity or physical
[21:40.690 --> 21:42.670]  exercise. And so
[21:42.670 --> 21:44.630]  I'm like, I'm looking at my watch and I'm like, eh, that's not
[21:44.630 --> 21:46.750]  I'll just, I'm trying to think of like, I'll go to a coffee shop
[21:46.750 --> 21:48.610]  for like 20 minutes, kill some time
[21:48.610 --> 21:50.710]  and then I'll head over because I've got this weird
[21:50.710 --> 21:52.710]  window where it doesn't make sense to
[21:52.710 --> 21:54.770]  come home or whatever. And then I get my phone
[21:54.770 --> 21:56.570]  text, I get a text and I look
[21:56.570 --> 21:58.410]  and it's the appointment people saying, hey
[21:58.410 --> 22:00.590]  asshole, your appointment's at 9. It's not at 10.
[22:00.650 --> 22:02.810]  It's at 9. And I'm like, ah, fuck!
[22:02.970 --> 22:04.310]  So I like have to run, grab Millie
[22:04.310 --> 22:06.130]  and run out the door and like
[22:07.330 --> 22:08.290]  haul ass to high school,
[22:08.290 --> 22:10.290]  throw her at the school, and then I
[22:10.290 --> 22:12.330]  look at the back of the sheet, it has the
[22:12.330 --> 22:14.170]  address, because there's like two central
[22:14.170 --> 22:16.390]  locations, because there's like, there's like 30 places
[22:16.390 --> 22:18.230]  you can go on the back of the sheet, and you just
[22:18.230 --> 22:20.370]  you know, I schedule the one close to me, of which
[22:20.370 --> 22:22.550]  there's two. So I drive in, it's like a hospital
[22:22.550 --> 22:24.310]  thing, so I gotta go in,
[22:24.510 --> 22:26.130]  I gotta go through the ticket counter,
[22:26.350 --> 22:28.270]  get a ticket, find a parking space,
[22:28.730 --> 22:30.410]  run through a thing, go over
[22:30.410 --> 22:32.290]  like a bridge, you know, through
[22:32.290 --> 22:34.170]  another structure to get in there
[22:34.170 --> 22:36.170]  to the x-ray place, and I
[22:36.170 --> 22:37.490]  hand them my paper, and they go,
[22:38.010 --> 22:39.850]  hey asshole, you're at the wrong place.
[22:40.270 --> 22:42.290]  And I'm like, what? And they're like, the place you are
[22:42.290 --> 22:44.270]  the place you are is two blocks away.
[22:44.370 --> 22:45.950]  And I'm like, MOTHERFUCKER!
[22:46.090 --> 22:48.150]  In my haste, I was freaking out,
[22:48.370 --> 22:49.970]  I picked the wrong goddamn
[22:50.370 --> 22:51.670]  x-ray store, right?
[22:52.310 --> 22:54.110]  So then I grab everything, and I
[22:54.110 --> 22:55.550]  run, I get back in my car,
[22:56.250 --> 22:58.190]  I fucking have to pay to get out of the parking
[22:58.190 --> 23:00.090]  garage to go to the other, to the other
[23:00.090 --> 23:02.350]  place, to the new x-ray store, right, to buy x-rays
[23:02.350 --> 23:04.210]  or whatever, and I fucking go, and I
[23:04.210 --> 23:06.090]  go all the way through, I get, this one's in a parking
[23:06.090 --> 23:07.310]  garage, so I gotta go to like the fucking,
[23:08.470 --> 23:10.270]  to the fucking fifth floor, I finally
[23:10.270 --> 23:11.870]  get there, I have one minute,
[23:12.150 --> 23:13.570]  and I'm like, I'm gonna fucking make this.
[23:13.850 --> 23:16.130]  I grab my phone, I
[23:16.130 --> 23:18.310]  open my door, I run out, I slam
[23:18.310 --> 23:19.950]  my door, I turn towards the elevator,
[23:20.130 --> 23:22.250]  and I throw my fucking phone across the parking
[23:22.250 --> 23:23.550]  lot, and I smash my phone.
[23:26.990 --> 23:28.310]  My brand new iPhone
[23:28.310 --> 23:29.750]  26, or whatever it is.
[23:29.990 --> 23:31.550]  Yeah, what's the new one? 13? 14?
[23:31.550 --> 23:33.250]  16? 62?
[23:33.430 --> 23:35.410]  I got a iPhone 19, and it's
[23:35.410 --> 23:35.710]  smashed.
[23:37.710 --> 23:39.050]  I'm so fucking annoyed.
[23:39.690 --> 23:41.450]  So mad at myself. Oh man, that's still
[23:41.450 --> 23:43.330]  so new. I know.
[23:43.950 --> 23:45.510]  Yeah, it feels a little weird to have a busted
[23:45.510 --> 23:47.390]  up spider-veined screen phone
[23:47.390 --> 23:47.750]  right now.
[23:49.250 --> 23:51.490]  All because you went to the wrong x-ray store.
[23:52.010 --> 23:53.710]  How unfortunate. If only
[23:53.710 --> 23:54.590]  you went to the right one. All because I, well,
[23:55.430 --> 23:57.510]  at the end of the day, it's all because I misremembered my appointment
[23:57.510 --> 23:59.510]  time, but yeah. But you made it on time.
[23:59.510 --> 24:01.770]  I did make it on time, and I got the x-rays,
[24:01.890 --> 24:03.030]  and hopefully we'll find out
[24:03.870 --> 24:05.550]  which of the big three I have.
[24:06.030 --> 24:07.290]  You know, I went to a doctor yesterday,
[24:07.830 --> 24:09.430]  because, I don't know if we covered this last week,
[24:09.510 --> 24:11.530]  but I think we might have. Just the intense
[24:11.530 --> 24:12.870]  amount of pain I'm in, I've been in.
[24:13.630 --> 24:15.650]  I don't remember. I don't think...
[24:15.650 --> 24:17.570]  Did I not even mention it? I don't think you've
[24:17.570 --> 24:19.690]  talked about that. I haven't talked about it. Well,
[24:19.830 --> 24:21.590]  I talked about how I started, my butt
[24:21.590 --> 24:23.670]  started to hurt riding the bike, and so I started
[24:23.670 --> 24:25.570]  to wear those shorts, right? And then I told the story
[24:25.570 --> 24:27.570]  about how I put my pants on over the shorts, and I
[24:27.570 --> 24:29.450]  went to the grocery store, and then I realized
[24:29.450 --> 24:31.590]  when the lady gave me the dirty look, I had a dumpy butt.
[24:31.710 --> 24:33.370]  Yeah, my butt was like folded in half.
[24:33.450 --> 24:34.170]  It was weird. Anyway.
[24:35.590 --> 24:37.430]  So, eventually, the shorts
[24:38.210 --> 24:39.850]  didn't work. Like, the pain
[24:39.850 --> 24:41.710]  was too much that I just had to stop
[24:41.710 --> 24:42.810]  riding my bike altogether.
[24:44.290 --> 24:45.390]  And that was fine,
[24:45.650 --> 24:47.510]  except the pain followed me. And then
[24:47.510 --> 24:49.730]  it got worse and worse, and then for about
[24:51.350 --> 24:51.750]  four
[24:51.750 --> 24:53.710]  days, week before
[24:53.710 --> 24:55.250]  last, or last week, somewhere in there,
[24:55.950 --> 24:57.010]  I couldn't sit.
[24:57.530 --> 24:59.410]  Like, if I sat down,
[24:59.590 --> 25:01.310]  the pain was so intense it made me cry.
[25:01.390 --> 25:03.250]  Like, I would cry. And I'm a
[25:03.250 --> 25:05.070]  very manly, non-crying type person, so
[25:05.070 --> 25:06.070]  you can tell.
[25:07.150 --> 25:09.330]  So I could only stand, or I could only lay down.
[25:09.610 --> 25:11.550]  And I was just in an incredible
[25:11.550 --> 25:12.470]  amount of pain.
[25:13.450 --> 25:14.870]  And so I went to the doctor.
[25:15.090 --> 25:16.910]  I had scheduled an appointment, and I went to the doctor yesterday,
[25:17.270 --> 25:19.210]  and he looked at me over, and he ordered
[25:19.210 --> 25:20.930]  the x-rays, and he said that it's either
[25:22.250 --> 25:22.610]  tendinitis,
[25:24.250 --> 25:24.490]  bursitis,
[25:26.130 --> 25:26.610]  or arthritis,
[25:26.830 --> 25:28.770]  but it's definitely an itis.
[25:29.390 --> 25:30.490]  And I'm like, okay,
[25:30.770 --> 25:32.670]  well, what do we do? And he's like, well, you're too
[25:32.670 --> 25:34.670]  young for arthritis. And I said, let me stop
[25:34.670 --> 25:36.310]  you there. Let me tell you about my shoulder.
[25:37.790 --> 25:38.590]  And he goes, nah,
[25:38.630 --> 25:40.750]  you don't have arthritis. And I go, I have a lot of arthritis
[25:40.750 --> 25:42.630]  on my shoulder. And he's like, how do you know? And I go, well, I got
[25:42.630 --> 25:44.530]  an MRI. And he goes, oh, you do have arthritis. And I go,
[25:44.570 --> 25:46.590]  yeah. And he goes, well, it could be that. And I go, so what do we
[25:46.590 --> 25:48.570]  do for these three things? And he goes, well, if it's tendinitis, you know,
[25:48.610 --> 25:50.410]  we'll put you on a treatment regimen, you'll do a
[25:50.410 --> 25:52.270]  significant amount of physical therapy,
[25:52.450 --> 25:54.130]  and then you'll be on your way. If it's
[25:54.130 --> 25:55.830]  bursitis, we'll put you on a different
[25:56.290 --> 25:58.150]  treatment regimen, you'll do a
[25:58.150 --> 25:59.110]  tremendous amount of
[26:00.790 --> 26:02.230]  physical therapy, and then you'll be on your way.
[26:02.610 --> 26:03.410]  And if it's arthritis,
[26:04.670 --> 26:06.270]  there's not much treatment we can do,
[26:06.370 --> 26:08.070]  but you'll do a tremendous amount of physical therapy
[26:08.070 --> 26:10.050]  and be on your way. So no matter what,
[26:10.130 --> 26:12.090]  I'm about to go through another God knows
[26:12.090 --> 26:14.130]  how long of fucking physical therapy. And I'm
[26:14.130 --> 26:16.370]  really jazzed about having another appointment every week.
[26:16.610 --> 26:18.390]  Do you think it's just for good at this
[26:18.390 --> 26:20.470]  point? Yeah. Just constant maintenance?
[26:21.290 --> 26:21.670]  Well,
[26:22.750 --> 26:23.950]  yeah. Honestly, I do.
[26:24.310 --> 26:26.470]  I mean, yeah, I think so. I think once you get
[26:26.470 --> 26:28.490]  to the advanced age
[26:28.490 --> 26:30.450]  of 46 or so, yeah, I think
[26:30.450 --> 26:32.610]  that your life becomes about managing
[26:32.610 --> 26:34.350]  medical appointments and stuff.
[26:34.450 --> 26:36.150]  It sucks. I need to live more in the moment.
[26:36.270 --> 26:37.130]  I need to appreciate
[26:38.910 --> 26:40.610]  my fine body right now.
[26:41.110 --> 26:42.410]  Yeah, and I'll be honest
[26:42.410 --> 26:44.350]  with you, and I say this
[26:44.350 --> 26:45.790]  without any ill
[26:46.390 --> 26:46.750]  feelings,
[26:46.930 --> 26:49.870]  but I don't think you'll age as well.
[26:50.290 --> 26:51.430]  I think it's going to be hard on you.
[26:53.130 --> 26:53.710]  I think
[26:55.110 --> 26:55.830]  your body's
[26:55.830 --> 26:57.490]  going to have a tough time. Really?
[26:57.610 --> 26:59.110]  I don't know. Just something about you.
[26:59.390 --> 27:01.430]  And I don't mean that to poke fun.
[27:02.630 --> 27:03.350]  I'm afraid
[27:03.870 --> 27:05.510]  for you a little bit.
[27:05.670 --> 27:07.010]  Well, you heard it here first.
[27:07.750 --> 27:09.810]  I want you to know, I will be here for you.
[27:09.910 --> 27:11.490]  I'm your friend. That might be the worst thing
[27:11.490 --> 27:12.790]  a friend has ever said to me.
[27:13.510 --> 27:14.790]  What, that I'll be here for you?
[27:14.890 --> 27:16.230]  I'll wheel you around, dude.
[27:16.310 --> 27:18.910]  Don't worry about it. What's going to happen
[27:18.910 --> 27:21.070]  to me? I don't know,
[27:21.190 --> 27:22.750]  but I'll tell you what. I don't know,
[27:22.910 --> 27:24.890]  but it will. If you need
[27:24.890 --> 27:26.690]  to wipe your face after
[27:26.690 --> 27:28.810]  stuff, because you can't, or you need
[27:28.810 --> 27:30.570]  me to tighten the blanket around your legs
[27:30.570 --> 27:32.810]  in the chair, whatever. I can do that. I'm going to be there
[27:32.810 --> 27:33.210]  for you.
[27:34.550 --> 27:36.630]  I'm just evaluating this
[27:36.630 --> 27:38.770]  for Gavin. I think a question he should
[27:38.770 --> 27:40.990]  be asking you, Geoff, is there anything you miss
[27:40.990 --> 27:42.710]  that you could do before, physically,
[27:42.870 --> 27:45.090]  that you no longer can? Riding bikes?
[27:46.570 --> 27:47.370]  I haven't
[27:47.370 --> 27:49.110]  ridden my bike in almost a month.
[27:49.530 --> 27:51.130]  I want to ride a bike so badly.
[27:51.290 --> 27:52.950]  I bet I'm going to get injured
[27:52.950 --> 27:54.930]  riding a bike because I'm
[27:54.930 --> 27:56.890]  trying to use up all of the fine bike
[27:56.890 --> 27:58.750]  time I have left too soon.
[27:58.970 --> 28:00.950]  I'm going to be strutting around
[28:00.950 --> 28:03.050]  on a bike because I can, and it's going to cause me
[28:03.050 --> 28:04.330]  to not be able to ride bikes anymore.
[28:04.630 --> 28:06.470]  It's a delicate balance, for sure.
[28:06.650 --> 28:09.310]  And it sucks too. Also, don't
[28:09.310 --> 28:11.290]  tie your coping mechanism
[28:11.290 --> 28:12.990]  here's a piece of real advice.
[28:13.170 --> 28:14.810]  Don't tie your coping mechanisms
[28:14.810 --> 28:17.290]  to physical shit that's going to break down
[28:17.290 --> 28:18.690]  later in life. Because
[28:19.450 --> 28:21.170]  as we all know, I was a
[28:21.170 --> 28:23.330]  tremendous alcoholic for twenty-something
[28:23.330 --> 28:24.870]  years. And I'm now
[28:24.870 --> 28:27.350]  almost five years sober, so no problems
[28:27.350 --> 28:28.110]  there. But
[28:29.990 --> 28:31.430]  when I stopped
[28:31.430 --> 28:33.270]  drinking and realized I had to actually process
[28:33.270 --> 28:34.830]  and deal with emotions and pain,
[28:35.650 --> 28:37.250]  part of the way I was able to do that was
[28:37.250 --> 28:39.230]  with this stupid bicycle. You know, riding my bike.
[28:39.390 --> 28:41.110]  People say, like, there's no way he's riding
[28:41.110 --> 28:43.170]  twenty miles a week, or twenty miles a day, or whatever.
[28:43.670 --> 28:45.070]  And even on any bike. And I'm like, no,
[28:45.170 --> 28:46.810]  I really do have that much shit to work out.
[28:46.930 --> 28:49.310]  And, uh, losing that
[28:50.270 --> 28:50.630]  ability...
[28:51.730 --> 28:53.290]  I realized I have been on
[28:53.290 --> 28:55.310]  edge for, like, the entire month.
[28:55.690 --> 28:57.190]  I got so bad yesterday,
[28:57.830 --> 28:58.970]  I had to go to the park,
[28:59.250 --> 29:01.310]  and I sat in the
[29:01.310 --> 29:03.250]  park, on a park bench, and I just
[29:03.250 --> 29:05.210]  cried for, like, maybe
[29:05.210 --> 29:07.090]  thirty minutes. Because I
[29:07.090 --> 29:09.230]  didn't know how to process... I didn't... I just
[29:09.230 --> 29:11.230]  sat there and thought about alcohol, which I don't
[29:11.230 --> 29:13.270]  ever do, and bike riding, and just
[29:13.270 --> 29:15.290]  how sad I was that there was, like, no way
[29:15.290 --> 29:17.170]  for me to, like, work through
[29:17.170 --> 29:19.270]  this. And, you know, and I was working through it in the
[29:19.270 --> 29:21.190]  moment. But, so, my real advice
[29:21.190 --> 29:23.070]  to you would be, like, don't tie your coping mechanisms
[29:23.070 --> 29:25.110]  to wheels. Because when the wheels
[29:25.110 --> 29:27.050]  break, or you break, then you lose your coping mechanism.
[29:27.230 --> 29:29.030]  And then you gotta cry in a park. And that's embarrassing.
[29:29.130 --> 29:31.250]  Feel free to always text me, by the way.
[29:31.270 --> 29:32.910]  If you need your mind taken off
[29:32.910 --> 29:34.810]  something, or if you don't want to cry
[29:34.810 --> 29:36.990]  in a park, I'm always here for you.
[29:37.430 --> 29:38.810]  Here's the deal, though, and I
[29:38.810 --> 29:40.910]  appreciate that, but if I were to text you, either
[29:40.910 --> 29:42.890]  of you, there'd be a 50% chance I wouldn't get
[29:42.890 --> 29:44.550]  a response, and that would make it worse.
[29:44.950 --> 29:46.950]  Look, if you text
[29:46.950 --> 29:49.190]  saying, hey, wanna do X?
[29:49.310 --> 29:50.230]  That's a response.
[29:50.750 --> 29:52.890]  If it's Wednesday
[29:52.890 --> 29:54.850]  morning, and you say, boy, do I have
[29:54.850 --> 29:56.850]  a story for tomorrow? Yeah, I can see why
[29:56.850 --> 29:58.330]  you wouldn't get a response. There's a...
[29:58.930 --> 30:00.810]  there's a park bench that's very
[30:01.870 --> 30:02.670]  conciliatory in
[30:02.670 --> 30:04.970]  Zilker Park that has been there for me a lot
[30:04.970 --> 30:06.770]  lately. I'm good with the
[30:06.770 --> 30:08.810]  park bench, but thank you. I think we should start one-wheeling
[30:08.810 --> 30:10.590]  around. I've been going on your path
[30:10.590 --> 30:12.690]  on one-wheeling. I've been going over... I've been
[30:12.690 --> 30:14.390]  going by your jump every day.
[30:14.590 --> 30:16.850]  Haven't yet taken it on on the one-wheel, because I'll die.
[30:17.850 --> 30:18.690]  It's a nice
[30:18.690 --> 30:20.710]  graceful path. It's very peaceful.
[30:21.290 --> 30:22.650]  And you don't have to sit... If I'm ever able...
[30:22.650 --> 30:24.690]  If I'm ever able to move my body
[30:24.690 --> 30:26.810]  in that way again, I
[30:26.810 --> 30:28.770]  will. I can't imagine the pain
[30:28.770 --> 30:30.730]  that would be caused from falling off a one-wheel right now.
[30:31.090 --> 30:32.750]  But, you know, listen, within
[30:32.750 --> 30:34.730]  24 hours, I'm gonna get a diagnosis
[30:35.190 --> 30:36.810]  and then I'll know what's wrong with me
[30:36.810 --> 30:38.810]  and then I can work towards getting better and then I'll
[30:38.810 --> 30:40.830]  get back on... I'll ride that bike again someday
[30:40.830 --> 30:42.730]  goddammit. I will. I'm not worried about that.
[30:43.170 --> 30:44.190]  Yes. Anyway,
[30:45.130 --> 30:46.490]  all I had today was
[30:47.390 --> 30:48.950]  the fact that I smashed my phone
[30:48.950 --> 30:50.390]  out of stupidity
[30:50.950 --> 30:52.710]  and that it's season 3
[30:52.710 --> 30:55.050]  now. I thought...
[30:55.050 --> 30:56.550]  What's up, Andrew? You gonna say something?
[30:56.550 --> 30:59.030]  I was just gonna say something, but I don't know if you're gonna lead it.
[30:59.450 --> 31:00.690]  Geoff just reminded me of
[31:00.690 --> 31:02.470]  a thing that I didn't write down
[31:02.470 --> 31:03.310]  to talk about.
[31:04.190 --> 31:05.830]  Is that what you're also gonna talk about?
[31:06.110 --> 31:08.330]  Gavin texted me late
[31:08.330 --> 31:09.850]  on Thursday night.
[31:10.550 --> 31:12.650]  What did he text me? He texted me something along the lines
[31:12.650 --> 31:14.470]  of, and I don't know if you have it, you can read it,
[31:15.010 --> 31:16.570]  I just was horrified by
[31:16.570 --> 31:18.610]  a turkey sandwich was essentially the
[31:18.610 --> 31:19.870]  core of the message.
[31:20.390 --> 31:22.770]  And I looked at it, and in a Geoff-like
[31:22.770 --> 31:24.590]  fashion, I thought, do I wanna know
[31:24.590 --> 31:26.110]  what this is? Is this
[31:26.110 --> 31:28.530]  for the show? Should I ask?
[31:28.630 --> 31:30.510]  Like, obviously, I'd like to know, but it
[31:30.510 --> 31:32.530]  feels like a show thing. I think what I texted you
[31:32.530 --> 31:34.630]  was, I just got one of the biggest
[31:34.630 --> 31:36.450]  frights of my life from a turkey
[31:36.450 --> 31:37.690]  sandwich. Yes.
[31:38.290 --> 31:40.490]  So I didn't reply to it that night, but then
[31:40.490 --> 31:42.610]  I remembered replying to it the next day.
[31:42.790 --> 31:44.790]  And then I never heard back from Gavin.
[31:45.350 --> 31:46.650]  And I was like, oh, I must've been busy.
[31:46.930 --> 31:48.450]  I know that game. Yeah.
[31:48.930 --> 31:49.990]  But then I got...
[31:50.710 --> 31:52.430]  I got a text on
[31:52.830 --> 31:54.430]  a different day, like four days
[31:54.430 --> 31:56.470]  later, three days later, and I just didn't
[31:56.470 --> 31:58.390]  send the message. I just wrote it, and then
[31:58.390 --> 32:00.370]  I never hit send. I just... I
[32:00.370 --> 32:02.350]  missed it. But I've been waiting. I've been like,
[32:02.350 --> 32:03.970]  it's weird. Didn't... It was me.
[32:04.330 --> 32:06.150]  And then something else was asked,
[32:06.270 --> 32:08.110]  completely irrelated. Not...
[32:08.110 --> 32:10.310]  Irrelated, that's not a word. Unrelated. I'm not gonna...
[32:10.310 --> 32:12.450]  I'm not gonna get an irregardless on that one.
[32:12.470 --> 32:14.350]  Irregardless. That was just me fucking up. That was
[32:14.350 --> 32:16.330]  me. But I just fucked up. I didn't
[32:16.330 --> 32:18.070]  get it. But I wanna know... You asked me
[32:18.070 --> 32:20.290]  to guess. I couldn't think of a way
[32:20.290 --> 32:22.550]  that a turkey sandwich could horrify anyone.
[32:22.670 --> 32:24.070]  Do you have any immediate thoughts, Geoff?
[32:24.070 --> 32:26.290]  It was more extreme than I... I thought I was gonna
[32:26.290 --> 32:28.050]  die. You thought you were gonna die?
[32:28.270 --> 32:30.130]  Yeah. Yeah. For a split
[32:30.130 --> 32:32.230]  second. But it was a turkey sandwich.
[32:35.170 --> 32:36.130]  I have no
[32:36.130 --> 32:38.310]  fucking clue. Is it... Like, maybe it
[32:38.310 --> 32:40.190]  was moldy turkey, or...
[32:40.190 --> 32:42.310]  I bet... I could put this out there
[32:42.310 --> 32:43.830]  to the public for a year.
[32:44.130 --> 32:46.230]  No one... I 100%
[32:46.230 --> 32:48.310]  guarantee no one would ever come
[32:48.310 --> 32:50.210]  up with this scenario. Because it makes
[32:50.210 --> 32:51.550]  absolutely no sense.
[32:52.150 --> 32:53.970]  Shall I run you through it? I'd love to.
[32:54.110 --> 32:56.090]  Please. Do you wanna
[32:56.090 --> 32:58.330]  preview the end of the story first, like in milkshake
[32:58.330 --> 33:00.150]  fashion? Or are you just gonna start at the beginning?
[33:00.750 --> 33:01.910]  I'll start at the beginning.
[33:02.570 --> 33:03.930]  It was so embarrassing.
[33:05.290 --> 33:07.610]  I was on a plane.
[33:08.490 --> 33:09.770]  And I think my subconscious
[33:09.770 --> 33:11.750]  had just been slightly affected
[33:12.140 --> 33:14.310]  by the fact that I saw
[33:14.310 --> 33:16.510]  this on my phone.
[33:16.510 --> 33:17.950]  Just on the home screen of my phone.
[33:18.450 --> 33:19.810]  On the weather app,
[33:20.310 --> 33:22.570]  it said, uh, small aircraft
[33:22.570 --> 33:24.530]  advisory. And I thought,
[33:25.130 --> 33:26.390]  well, that probably is something
[33:26.390 --> 33:28.470]  to do with, you know, if you're in
[33:28.470 --> 33:30.570]  a small aircraft, maybe visibility
[33:30.570 --> 33:32.110]  is shit. Or
[33:32.670 --> 33:34.550]  something to do with that. But in my
[33:34.550 --> 33:36.470]  head, I was thinking, like... I think
[33:36.470 --> 33:38.330]  I was, like, dozing off or something. I was thinking, like,
[33:38.670 --> 33:40.290]  oh, does that mean there's, like, a shitload of
[33:40.290 --> 33:41.590]  small planes around?
[33:42.170 --> 33:44.590]  Like, our plane is, like, gonna have
[33:44.590 --> 33:46.110]  to dodge a bunch of small planes.
[33:46.510 --> 33:48.650]  There was, like, 1% of my
[33:48.650 --> 33:50.350]  brain that thought that's what it meant.
[33:50.510 --> 33:52.570]  There's a swarm of small planes outside.
[33:53.210 --> 33:55.050]  Yeah, the rest of my brain
[33:55.050 --> 33:56.890]  was like, oh, it's probably foggy
[33:56.890 --> 33:58.830]  or something. And as you can see by the screenshot,
[33:58.950 --> 34:00.490]  I'm apparently over the North Atlantic
[34:00.490 --> 34:00.930]  Ocean.
[34:02.190 --> 34:04.550]  And then I decided, I'll just keep
[34:04.550 --> 34:05.970]  an eye out. I'll look out the window.
[34:09.210 --> 34:10.430]  Just make sure there's not
[34:11.570 --> 34:12.650]  a swarm of
[34:12.650 --> 34:13.090]  planes.
[34:13.930 --> 34:16.670]  You're keeping an eye out. How does that help?
[34:16.890 --> 34:18.750]  Are you, like, ready to yell at the,
[34:18.790 --> 34:20.690]  like, what is the plan? Like, I'm
[34:20.690 --> 34:22.870]  gonna be on guard, guys. Like, what? Why?
[34:23.470 --> 34:24.570]  And I should point out,
[34:24.890 --> 34:26.730]  I'd slept for about two hours
[34:26.730 --> 34:28.690]  the night before. It's like, you're
[34:28.690 --> 34:30.630]  on a plane and you're dumb because you're tired.
[34:30.630 --> 34:32.730]  Just one of those days. And I was
[34:32.730 --> 34:34.570]  looking out the window and suddenly
[34:34.570 --> 34:36.850]  I got the fright of my life
[34:36.850 --> 34:38.170]  in my peripheral vision.
[34:39.230 --> 34:40.690]  I saw what
[34:40.690 --> 34:43.030]  I thought was a plane hurtling
[34:43.030 --> 34:44.630]  into the side of our plane.
[34:46.290 --> 34:47.930]  And then we posted a picture.
[34:48.850 --> 34:50.730]  All it was, was the flight
[34:50.730 --> 34:52.670]  attendant sliding a turkey
[34:52.670 --> 34:54.430]  sandwich onto the plate,
[34:54.870 --> 34:56.930]  onto the tray of the guy behind me.
[34:57.630 --> 34:58.970]  But in my peripheral vision,
[34:59.330 --> 35:00.890]  because it was under his light,
[35:01.530 --> 35:02.550]  it was under his light,
[35:03.110 --> 35:04.750]  it just came, like, at
[35:04.750 --> 35:06.230]  the plane in the reflection.
[35:06.630 --> 35:08.590]  And I jumped back and I was like,
[35:08.590 --> 35:08.890]  what?
[35:13.670 --> 35:16.290]  But, um, yeah, it was just perfectly...
[35:16.290 --> 35:17.810]  because there was nothing on his tray,
[35:18.170 --> 35:19.770]  there was, like, nothing lit up
[35:19.770 --> 35:21.730]  until the flight attendant aggressively
[35:21.730 --> 35:23.830]  slid a turkey sandwich, which
[35:23.830 --> 35:25.650]  just caused a weird optical illusion.
[35:26.230 --> 35:28.490]  And at that point I was just like, I need to get some sleep.
[35:28.550 --> 35:29.570]  And my heart was beating
[35:29.570 --> 35:31.850]  like 100 beats a minute
[35:31.850 --> 35:33.330]  for, like, two straight minutes.
[35:33.870 --> 35:35.390]  Because I thought I was going to die.
[35:36.050 --> 35:37.550]  It came out of nowhere, man.
[35:37.550 --> 35:39.850]  Did you scream out loudly?
[35:40.290 --> 35:41.910]  Yeah, I was just like,
[35:42.110 --> 35:42.450]  bah!
[35:44.890 --> 35:45.750]  Did anybody notice?
[35:46.790 --> 35:47.730]  I don't know.
[35:47.890 --> 35:49.250]  I was too embarrassed to look around.
[35:51.110 --> 35:53.190]  I don't think he needed to
[35:53.190 --> 35:55.330]  put the turkey sandwich there with such force.
[35:55.610 --> 35:58.430]  It looked like he was coming in at, like, 200 miles an hour.
[36:00.370 --> 36:01.650]  I would have asked him for
[36:01.650 --> 36:03.310]  his turkey sandwich that is now,
[36:03.430 --> 36:04.410]  that's, like, a collectible.
[36:04.410 --> 36:06.530]  Instead of a UAP, you saw
[36:06.530 --> 36:07.170]  a UAT.
[36:13.850 --> 36:16.050]  Do you think anyone would have guessed that?
[36:16.370 --> 36:17.830]  I don't think...
[36:17.830 --> 36:19.850]  Not only do I think nobody would have guessed that,
[36:19.930 --> 36:22.390]  I don't think anyone in the history of the Earth
[36:22.390 --> 36:24.270]  has ever mistaken a turkey
[36:24.270 --> 36:25.370]  sandwich for an airplane.
[36:26.130 --> 36:28.310]  I'm notoriously bad with reflections.
[36:28.530 --> 36:30.590]  Did I tell you about the time where I got scared
[36:30.590 --> 36:32.350]  by someone because I thought they were me?
[36:35.270 --> 36:35.710]  What?
[36:36.590 --> 36:38.430]  I was walking into a hotel
[36:38.430 --> 36:40.470]  at a glass door, and I could
[36:40.470 --> 36:41.610]  see my reflection
[36:42.530 --> 36:44.250]  in the glass, and I
[36:44.250 --> 36:46.490]  got all the way to the door, and I opened the
[36:46.490 --> 36:48.650]  door, and I realized it wasn't my reflection,
[36:48.990 --> 36:50.430]  it was just a man on the
[36:50.430 --> 36:52.530]  inside of the hotel wearing the exact same
[36:52.530 --> 36:54.250]  colored shirt as me, and we were moving
[36:54.250 --> 36:56.450]  and putting our arms out at the exact
[36:56.450 --> 36:58.450]  same time. He was mimicking me
[36:58.450 --> 37:00.390]  entirely, and so when I opened the door and he was
[37:00.390 --> 37:02.670]  there, I just jumped out of my skin.
[37:03.930 --> 37:04.730]  I don't deal
[37:04.730 --> 37:05.770]  with reflections well.
[37:07.590 --> 37:08.350]  Oh, God.
[37:09.590 --> 37:10.590]  Nick brought up
[37:10.590 --> 37:13.710]  Jack's gonna have good luck figuring this out.
[37:13.710 --> 37:14.910]  I cannot wait to hear
[37:14.910 --> 37:15.970]  Jack's teaser.
[37:17.330 --> 37:18.790]  Boy, that seems to be going well
[37:18.790 --> 37:20.850]  still. People seem to really be liking
[37:22.350 --> 37:23.430]  Minor League Jack's
[37:24.290 --> 37:25.050]  little previews.
[37:25.310 --> 37:26.730]  We might have to be careful with that one, because he could
[37:26.730 --> 37:28.910]  potentially give the punchline to the joke.
[37:29.450 --> 37:30.810]  Well, I guess it's not. Well, maybe he
[37:30.810 --> 37:32.010]  won't get it. I don't know.
[37:32.130 --> 37:34.830]  I don't think there's any way. I can't wait to hear his
[37:34.830 --> 37:36.470]  take on the turkey.
[37:36.830 --> 37:38.690]  That'll be great. Oh, Nick's removed
[37:38.690 --> 37:40.550]  something, so I think we're good. Ooh.
[37:41.130 --> 37:41.610]  Okay.
[37:42.470 --> 37:44.810]  Well, this is very food heavy.
[37:49.620 --> 37:51.780]  Please feel free to ad-lib the introduction
[37:51.780 --> 37:53.760]  with a topic or personalized story. Here's
[37:53.760 --> 37:55.320]  a personalized story for you.
[37:55.580 --> 37:57.080]  I care about my teeth.
[37:57.500 --> 37:59.040]  I have been to the dentist
[37:59.980 --> 38:01.720]  14 times in the last year
[38:01.720 --> 38:04.140]  and a half, dealing with a variety
[38:04.140 --> 38:05.880]  of issues. Therefore,
[38:06.220 --> 38:07.660]  I take my mouth
[38:07.660 --> 38:09.880]  and mouth care very
[38:09.880 --> 38:11.400]  very seriously, which
[38:11.400 --> 38:13.480]  is why I use Quip.
[38:13.860 --> 38:15.720]  As they say, good health starts with good
[38:15.720 --> 38:17.720]  habits. Quip makes it easy by
[38:17.720 --> 38:19.820]  delivering all the oral care essentials
[38:19.820 --> 38:21.720]  you need to care for your mouth.
[38:21.880 --> 38:23.660]  And please, care for your
[38:23.660 --> 38:25.480]  mouth, your precious mouth.
[38:25.840 --> 38:27.700]  It does so much for you. It is
[38:27.700 --> 38:29.820]  the conduit with which you receive
[38:29.820 --> 38:31.440]  nourishment and
[38:31.440 --> 38:34.080]  how you communicate at large with the world.
[38:34.340 --> 38:35.760]  It's an important tool.
[38:36.120 --> 38:37.760]  And speaking of important tools, the
[38:37.760 --> 38:39.700]  Quip electric toothbrush is loved by
[38:39.700 --> 38:41.820]  more than 7 million mouths and has
[38:41.820 --> 38:43.660]  time sonic vibrations with
[38:43.660 --> 38:45.720]  30 second pulses to guide a dentist's
[38:45.720 --> 38:47.560]  recommended 2 minute clean, which works
[38:47.560 --> 38:49.800]  very well, by the way. A lightweight
[38:49.800 --> 38:51.740]  and sleek design for
[38:51.740 --> 38:53.720]  adults and kids with no wires
[38:53.720 --> 38:55.780]  or bulky chargers to weigh you down. Can you imagine
[38:55.780 --> 38:57.720]  sticking a giant
[38:57.720 --> 38:59.640]  toothbrush in your mouth that had like a charging
[38:59.640 --> 39:01.500]  cable hanging out of it? That would be weird.
[39:01.860 --> 39:03.740]  A multi-use travel cover that
[39:03.740 --> 39:05.740]  doubles as a mirror mount for less clutter.
[39:06.180 --> 39:07.740]  My daughter loves that mirror mount thing.
[39:07.800 --> 39:09.820]  She thinks it's the coolest thing ever. Reusable
[39:09.820 --> 39:11.680]  handles in a range of sleek
[39:11.680 --> 39:13.920]  metal hues, including best selling
[39:13.920 --> 39:15.460]  all black and all pink,
[39:15.780 --> 39:17.820]  as well as bright plastic colors sure
[39:17.820 --> 39:19.660]  to make a pop to your bathroom counter.
[39:20.080 --> 39:21.660]  And it's not just brushing. Quip has everything
[39:21.660 --> 39:23.720]  you need to build a complete routine. We're talking
[39:23.720 --> 39:25.920]  about anti-cavity toothpaste. We're talking about
[39:25.920 --> 39:27.800]  floss string or reusable
[39:27.800 --> 39:29.900]  floss picks that replace over
[39:29.900 --> 39:31.840]  180 disposable picks with
[39:31.840 --> 39:34.000]  every refill. Plus refillable gum
[39:34.000 --> 39:35.920]  that's sugar free and has a long
[39:35.920 --> 39:37.820]  lasting mint flavor that comes with a
[39:37.820 --> 39:39.540]  dispenser. Everybody loves a dispenser.
[39:39.740 --> 39:41.840]  Like I'm dispensing mouth wisdom to you
[39:41.840 --> 39:43.760]  right now. Refillable mouthwash that is a
[39:43.760 --> 39:46.000]  four times concentrate. Four
[39:46.000 --> 39:47.900]  times. That's serious business.
[39:48.320 --> 39:50.080]  And with stylish and affordable electric
[39:50.080 --> 39:51.600]  brushes starting at just $25,
[39:52.160 --> 39:53.940]  you won't be paying through the teeth
[39:53.940 --> 39:55.980]  for better oral health. If you

[40:15.940 --> 40:17.820]  the good habits company. This
[40:17.820 --> 40:19.900]  podcast is sponsored by Better
[40:19.900 --> 40:21.900]  Help Online Therapy. We
[40:21.900 --> 40:23.880]  talk about Better Help a lot on this show.
[40:24.260 --> 40:25.960]  And this month, we're discussing some of the
[40:25.960 --> 40:27.860]  stigmas around mental
[40:27.860 --> 40:29.840]  health. For example, some people think
[40:29.840 --> 40:31.880]  you should wait until things are unbearable
[40:31.880 --> 40:33.760]  to go to therapy. But that's not
[40:33.760 --> 40:36.100]  true. You don't wait until your bone is extra
[40:36.100 --> 40:37.960]  extra broken before you get it set.
[40:38.360 --> 40:39.860]  Therapy is a tool to utilize
[40:39.860 --> 40:41.820]  before things get worse. And it
[40:41.820 --> 40:43.840]  can help you avoid those lows. You
[40:43.840 --> 40:45.820]  wouldn't drive your car around with no
[40:45.820 --> 40:47.820]  oil and think, I'll get to it eventually
[40:47.820 --> 40:50.000]  when the problem's when I throw a rod.
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.140]  No, you take care of it while it's still
[40:52.140 --> 40:54.140]  manageable. Many people think therapy
[40:54.140 --> 40:56.040]  is for so-called crazy people.
[40:56.280 --> 40:58.060]  But therapy doesn't mean something's wrong
[40:58.060 --> 41:00.000]  with you. It means that you recognize
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.040]  that all humans have emotions, and we
[41:02.040 --> 41:04.200]  need to learn to control them, not
[41:04.200 --> 41:06.080]  avoid them. Remember, the only
[41:06.080 --> 41:08.280]  way out is through, as smarter
[41:08.280 --> 41:09.620]  people than me have told me.
[41:09.900 --> 41:12.060]  We've also been taught that mental health shouldn't
[41:12.060 --> 41:13.980]  be a part of normal life. But that's wrong
[41:13.980 --> 41:15.940]  too. These are old, antiquated
[41:15.940 --> 41:18.000]  ideas. We take care of our bodies with
[41:18.000 --> 41:19.980]  the gym, the doctor, with nutrition.
[41:20.440 --> 41:22.240]  So focus on our minds
[41:22.240 --> 41:24.240]  as well. It's just as important.
[41:24.760 --> 41:25.960]  I have been in and out of therapy
[41:25.960 --> 41:28.020]  now for 15 years or
[41:28.020 --> 41:29.960]  so, and it
[41:29.960 --> 41:31.840]  has really helped me through
[41:31.840 --> 41:34.100]  some of the most difficult periods of my
[41:34.100 --> 41:36.060]  life. And now I'm
[41:36.060 --> 41:37.900]  kind of at a point where it just
[41:37.900 --> 41:40.120]  kind of helps me see things
[41:40.120 --> 41:42.120]  clearly. It's great to have somebody
[41:42.120 --> 41:44.260]  to bounce things off of
[41:44.260 --> 41:46.020]  and, you know, kind of check
[41:46.020 --> 41:47.040]  me and make sure I'm
[41:47.820 --> 41:50.140]  keeping up to date on all the things that I need to be doing
[41:50.140 --> 41:51.840]  to keep myself healthy. It's
[41:52.480 --> 41:53.720]  become invaluable for me.
[41:54.080 --> 41:55.940]  So BetterHelp is customized online
[41:55.940 --> 41:58.180]  therapy that offers video, phone, and even
[41:58.180 --> 41:59.760]  live chat sessions with your therapist.
[41:59.840 --> 42:02.060]  So you don't have to see anyone on camera if you don't
[42:02.060 --> 42:03.880]  want to. It is much more affordable
[42:03.880 --> 42:06.020]  than in-person therapy, and you can be
[42:06.020 --> 42:08.160]  matched with a therapist in under 48
[42:08.160 --> 42:09.480]  hours. Give it a try.
[42:10.040 --> 42:12.080]  By the way, good luck going to the doctor
[42:12.080 --> 42:13.980]  or the dentist in under 48 hours. That's a
[42:13.980 --> 42:15.940]  great response time. So give it a try
[42:15.940 --> 42:17.880]  and see why over 2 million people
[42:17.880 --> 42:19.720]  have used BetterHelp online therapy.

[42:39.920 --> 42:41.980]  and welcome to another episode of
[42:41.980 --> 42:44.000]  the F*** Face podcast. This is
[42:44.000 --> 42:45.380]  episode 82.
[42:46.040 --> 42:47.420]  Uh, big surprise!
[42:47.840 --> 42:50.240]  This is episode 1 of season 3
[42:50.240 --> 42:52.200]  year 2 of the F*** Face
[42:52.200 --> 42:54.040]  podcast. Congratulations, guys. We made
[42:54.040 --> 42:55.980]  it into the third season.
[42:56.300 --> 42:58.060]  Let's hope we get renewed. Anyway, you were saying?
[42:58.460 --> 42:59.940]  If we want to take it away from food
[42:59.940 --> 43:01.860]  I have a quick question for Andrew
[43:01.860 --> 43:03.860]  just because we were on the subject of movies.
[43:04.440 --> 43:05.980]  Go ahead. And I just thought
[43:05.980 --> 43:07.940]  this would be... I think you would have an answer for this
[43:07.940 --> 43:10.180]  maybe. Okay. What is the perfect
[43:10.980 --> 43:12.220]  escalation of a scenario
[43:13.500 --> 43:14.220]  between the
[43:14.220 --> 43:16.120]  original movie and the sequel? Like,
[43:16.220 --> 43:18.160]  where they are clearly paying homage
[43:18.160 --> 43:20.300]  to their original movie, but also
[43:20.300 --> 43:22.200]  trying to one-up it. And I think I have the perfect
[43:22.200 --> 43:24.180]  answer. I'd like to hear your answer first
[43:24.180 --> 43:26.240]  to get a better understanding of kind of where your
[43:26.240 --> 43:28.240]  head is at with this. Yeah, I'm right there too.
[43:28.760 --> 43:30.020]  Uh, the paint cans
[43:30.020 --> 43:31.200]  in Home Alone.
[43:32.840 --> 43:33.940]  Funny in the first one.
[43:34.060 --> 43:36.020]  They nail it. They both take a paint can to the face.
[43:36.100 --> 43:38.380]  The second one, they're ready for the paint cans.
[43:38.380 --> 43:40.460]  They've dodged them both and then they take a
[43:40.460 --> 43:42.560]  big metal bar right in the
[43:42.560 --> 43:44.400]  face. It's one of the best moments
[43:44.400 --> 43:46.300]  of the movie. And it's shot so well.
[43:46.380 --> 43:48.360]  It's like, I usually don't like a lot of
[43:48.360 --> 43:50.500]  quick cuts because I just tend to
[43:50.500 --> 43:52.440]  like as much to be done in the same
[43:52.440 --> 43:54.060]  shot as possible, especially with action.
[43:54.620 --> 43:56.380]  But every single
[43:56.380 --> 43:58.500]  shot in that sequence is an absolute
[43:58.500 --> 44:00.540]  masterpiece. The thing hits them in the
[44:00.540 --> 44:02.500]  face. It looks like it hits them in the face.
[44:02.720 --> 44:04.420]  It's like a split second cut where
[44:04.420 --> 44:06.540]  they're just falling backwards down a hole.
[44:06.540 --> 44:08.100]  It's like a half second shot
[44:08.100 --> 44:10.640]  that must have taken like an entire day
[44:10.640 --> 44:12.480]  to set up. It's an absolutely
[44:12.480 --> 44:13.980]  crazy sequence and I think
[44:14.540 --> 44:16.740]  the perfect escalation of an original
[44:16.740 --> 44:18.340]  movie. I think that
[44:18.960 --> 44:20.580]  I think the thing that makes
[44:20.580 --> 44:22.040]  those Home Alone movies so great
[44:22.040 --> 44:24.600]  is that they treat human beings
[44:24.600 --> 44:25.580]  like
[44:26.320 --> 44:27.940]  their Wile E. Coyote.
[44:28.340 --> 44:30.740]  It's a cartoon movie. In a fucking Bugs Bunny
[44:30.740 --> 44:32.100]  commercial. Or Bugs Bunny cartoon.
[44:32.540 --> 44:34.540]  It's just they give... if they got
[44:34.540 --> 44:36.460]  hit in real life by that pipe
[44:37.060 --> 44:38.740]  their skulls would cave in.
[44:39.220 --> 44:40.620]  Yeah, their heads would have been knocked off.
[44:40.940 --> 44:41.840]  Yeah, you know, yeah.
[44:42.880 --> 44:44.620]  And if that didn't kill them, the fall
[44:44.620 --> 44:46.580]  would have. It's so fucking funny.
[44:47.180 --> 44:48.460]  Kevin McCallister would be
[44:48.460 --> 44:50.420]  he would be in jail for
[44:50.420 --> 44:52.720]  homicide. I think it's self defense, but
[44:52.720 --> 44:54.620]  yeah. Ah, the
[44:54.620 --> 44:56.360]  classic Michael Myers defense.
[44:56.820 --> 44:57.780]  The Halloween 7.
[44:59.640 --> 45:00.680]  I'm trying to think.
[45:00.780 --> 45:02.380]  Like that's an interesting... it's not even
[45:02.380 --> 45:04.080]  necessarily... it's like
[45:04.080 --> 45:06.400]  a sequel to a movie in which the
[45:06.400 --> 45:08.480]  characters are the same and they're doing a similar
[45:08.480 --> 45:10.320]  task, but they've learned something
[45:10.320 --> 45:12.120]  from the first one that somehow
[45:13.100 --> 45:14.360]  broadens their knowledge.
[45:14.920 --> 45:16.440]  Yeah, I just remember liking that
[45:16.440 --> 45:17.860]  so much as a kid.
[45:18.120 --> 45:20.280]  When the same actor
[45:20.280 --> 45:22.320]  as the same character would reference
[45:22.320 --> 45:24.400]  or remember something from the previous
[45:24.400 --> 45:26.500]  movie. I just used to eat that shit
[45:26.500 --> 45:27.900]  up. Like even in The Mummy.
[45:28.080 --> 45:30.420]  When Brendan Fraser would be like, ah, not these guys
[45:30.420 --> 45:32.440]  again. Stuff like that when I was 11.
[45:32.720 --> 45:34.500]  I loved it because it was like, ah, I'm
[45:34.500 --> 45:35.560]  in on this reference.
[45:37.120 --> 45:38.680]  That's a great question
[45:38.680 --> 45:40.480]  that I don't have an answer to. I'm trying to
[45:40.480 --> 45:42.320]  think. Man, the last
[45:42.320 --> 45:44.660]  movie question you had, I felt like I had 400
[45:44.660 --> 45:46.480]  answers immediately. I got nothing
[45:46.480 --> 45:48.560]  for this. Because a lot of movies don't do it well.
[45:48.680 --> 45:50.140]  They'll either go way overboard
[45:50.140 --> 45:52.380]  or something will happen and they
[45:52.380 --> 45:54.600]  won't remember that it's happened before and stuff like that.
[45:54.840 --> 45:55.980]  It was just... it was ideal.
[45:56.660 --> 45:58.700]  Yeah, I'm trying to think of just like sequels
[45:58.700 --> 46:00.820]  in general. I feel like there must
[46:00.820 --> 46:02.780]  have been something they learned between Independence
[46:02.780 --> 46:04.840]  Day 1 and 2, but what that was, I couldn't
[46:04.840 --> 46:06.320]  tell you. I have no idea.
[46:06.680 --> 46:07.880]  But I'm sure there was something.
[46:09.880 --> 46:10.280]  Um...
[46:10.280 --> 46:12.820]  Oh, uh, how about Karate Kid
[46:13.400 --> 46:13.800]  2?
[46:14.420 --> 46:16.240]  When Daniel goes to do the
[46:16.240 --> 46:18.840]  fucking leg kick and the dude's like, yeah, I saw that before.
[46:19.280 --> 46:20.640]  Fuck you. And then he has to come up with
[46:20.640 --> 46:22.500]  a whole new way to fight. I haven't seen
[46:22.500 --> 46:24.700]  Karate Kid 2, but it's similar.
[46:24.960 --> 46:26.840]  I haven't seen the second one. You guys ever saw Karate Kid 2?
[46:27.440 --> 46:29.100]  No. Wow, he goes to Okinawa
[46:29.100 --> 46:30.800]  and fights in Okinawa, and over there,
[46:30.900 --> 46:32.620]  they know all of his tricks. Yeah.
[46:32.860 --> 46:33.820]  A whole different world.
[46:34.980 --> 46:36.240]  You guys should see it. It was real good.
[46:38.480 --> 46:38.840]  Um...
[46:38.840 --> 46:40.960]  Fuck, I don't... yeah, that's a
[46:40.960 --> 46:43.040]  great... I'll have to think about that. We'll come back to it.
[46:43.100 --> 46:44.380]  We'll come back to it next week. We will come back to it.
[46:44.720 --> 46:47.040]  Speaking of, Andrew, did you... because you said you were going
[46:47.040 --> 46:48.780]  to... did you ever watch Home Sweet Home Alone?
[46:49.140 --> 46:51.040]  I was going to last night, and I
[46:51.040 --> 46:53.100]  forgot. Well, I remember... I forgot
[46:53.100 --> 46:55.100]  until last night. Then I didn't...
[46:55.100 --> 46:56.720]  I was like, ah, it probably won't come up today.
[46:57.260 --> 46:59.080]  And I was wrong. I was
[46:59.080 --> 47:01.200]  clearly wrong about that. Because every time
[47:01.200 --> 47:02.400]  I prepare for a thing,
[47:03.020 --> 47:05.180]  it never happens. So I thought, ah, this will
[47:05.180 --> 47:07.220]  be another one of those. I'm just
[47:07.220 --> 47:09.340]  glad I randomly watched The Mummy yesterday.
[47:10.060 --> 47:10.460]  Yeah.
[47:11.920 --> 47:13.260]  I had no idea it was going to come
[47:13.260 --> 47:14.820]  up 17 times during this episode.
[47:15.040 --> 47:16.560]  I don't believe you.
[47:16.720 --> 47:18.140]  I don't believe that you watched The Mummy.
[47:18.860 --> 47:21.100]  Oh, nor should you. That was... obviously
[47:21.100 --> 47:21.820]  I was full of shit.
[47:21.820 --> 47:22.260]  Yes.
[47:23.820 --> 47:25.180]  Yeah, I didn't actually watch The Mummy. Wait a minute.
[47:25.500 --> 47:27.680]  I watched Survivor. Wait, does Geoff
[47:27.680 --> 47:29.800]  not know sarcasm? Can we do this to him?
[47:30.220 --> 47:31.800]  Is he not? Because everyone
[47:31.800 --> 47:33.740]  else just... I don't think you know how to
[47:33.740 --> 47:35.740]  be sarcastic, Geoff. No, I think that
[47:35.740 --> 47:37.600]  you just don't know how to read sarcasm.
[47:38.020 --> 47:39.800]  I don't know. The whole room, I think the whole
[47:39.800 --> 47:40.880]  room believed your mummy lie.
[47:43.880 --> 47:45.260]  Well, I think that says a lot about the room.
[47:46.440 --> 47:46.760]  Yeah.
[47:47.880 --> 47:48.780]  No, I'm not going to argue.
[47:48.780 --> 47:49.480]  Yeah.
[47:50.880 --> 47:52.320]  I'm not going to counter that point.
[47:52.500 --> 47:54.840]  You're completely accurate. Nick, did you believe
[47:54.840 --> 47:56.600]  him too? He said
[47:57.280 --> 47:58.820]  absolutely. Yeah, Nick absolutely
[47:58.820 --> 48:00.720]  did as well. He's being sarcastic.
[48:00.820 --> 48:02.760]  You guys can't read it. The problem is
[48:02.760 --> 48:04.840]  with this show specifically, there's so
[48:04.840 --> 48:06.640]  many dumb coincidences that
[48:06.640 --> 48:08.860]  have happened during the entirety
[48:08.860 --> 48:10.820]  of our up-to-now three-season run
[48:10.820 --> 48:12.760]  that it wouldn't be
[48:12.760 --> 48:14.700]  out of the question that you would have happened to
[48:14.700 --> 48:16.080]  have watched The Mummy the day before.
[48:16.080 --> 48:18.040]  I will give you that. It is
[48:18.040 --> 48:19.720]  so fucking absurd
[48:19.720 --> 48:21.940]  that I find it hard to believe some of the
[48:21.940 --> 48:23.980]  coincidences that are happening. And they're happening to me.
[48:24.240 --> 48:25.860]  You know? You're right.
[48:26.020 --> 48:28.140]  This podcast is either
[48:28.140 --> 48:30.040]  charmed or cursed, I think,
[48:30.120 --> 48:31.140]  depending on how you look at it.
[48:32.100 --> 48:33.260]  I go with charmed.
[48:33.640 --> 48:35.100]  I would go with charmed as well.
[48:36.700 --> 48:37.540]  I have a thing
[48:37.540 --> 48:40.000]  I was going to talk about, not food-related. I got a bunch of
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.180]  things that are food-related. It's just weirdly food-heavy.
[48:42.360 --> 48:43.320]  You can do food.
[48:43.320 --> 48:44.440]  I can do food.
[48:45.080 --> 48:47.380]  I'm curious about your answer, but I have a feeling it might
[48:47.380 --> 48:49.340]  be like Gavin's question, where I don't know if you guys
[48:49.340 --> 48:51.260]  will have an answer to this. It was just an odd
[48:51.260 --> 48:53.600]  thought I had today. What is
[48:53.600 --> 48:55.340]  the thing that you've done the
[48:55.340 --> 48:57.360]  most without doing
[48:57.360 --> 48:59.420]  it? Is there a thing that you
[48:59.420 --> 49:01.340]  can... So, I'll give you an example. And I'm not proud
[49:01.340 --> 49:01.680]  of this.
[49:02.900 --> 49:05.260]  But I was listening to a thing, and they were
[49:05.260 --> 49:07.400]  talking about how, like, yeah, you buy
[49:07.400 --> 49:09.500]  this product, and they will plant
[49:09.500 --> 49:11.360]  a tree. For everyone that's
[49:11.360 --> 49:12.820]  bought, they will plant a tree
[49:13.180 --> 49:15.260]  with the money you spent on it. I don't
[49:15.260 --> 49:16.940]  think I've ever planted a tree before,
[49:17.140 --> 49:19.000]  but I've planted so many trees.
[49:19.440 --> 49:21.280]  I've bought so many things
[49:21.280 --> 49:23.320]  that have planted trees, or have, like,
[49:23.340 --> 49:25.400]  I even switched to the web browser that was like,
[49:25.420 --> 49:27.260]  we'll plant a tree, however many
[49:27.260 --> 49:28.900]  searches, you can see how many trees you've planted.
[49:29.520 --> 49:31.340]  I've done that. I've planted a
[49:31.340 --> 49:33.320]  fuck-ton of trees. I don't think I've ever actually
[49:33.320 --> 49:35.320]  personally, physically planted a tree.
[49:35.980 --> 49:37.320]  I guess in a similar vein,
[49:37.420 --> 49:39.580]  we've raised, like, a lot of money for kids.
[49:39.580 --> 49:41.720]  I've never given money to a kid.
[49:45.420 --> 49:47.400]  This could take a really bad turn.
[49:47.660 --> 49:49.520]  I've killed so many people in Halo.
[49:49.700 --> 49:50.940]  I've never murdered anybody.
[49:52.680 --> 49:53.600]  It's probably
[49:53.600 --> 49:55.880]  that. It's probably all the people I murdered online
[49:56.380 --> 49:57.740]  throughout the course of my life.
[49:58.940 --> 49:59.640]  Oh my
[49:59.640 --> 50:00.820]  God. Hmm.
[50:01.640 --> 50:03.560]  I mean, there's a lot of stuff that I think
[50:03.560 --> 50:05.480]  about that's not the same, but
[50:05.480 --> 50:07.580]  similar. I think I've worked out
[50:08.100 --> 50:09.760]  way more in The Sims than I have
[50:09.760 --> 50:11.820]  in real life, and that makes me sad to think about.
[50:12.000 --> 50:13.100]  How about, what do you think
[50:13.100 --> 50:15.640]  is the thing that you've paid for the most
[50:15.640 --> 50:17.760]  that you've used the least? Because you say that, and I instantly
[50:17.760 --> 50:19.640]  think of the two years I had a gym membership
[50:19.640 --> 50:21.520]  that I forgot about that I never went to.
[50:21.940 --> 50:23.680]  Oh. Paid the most
[50:23.680 --> 50:25.580]  and used the least. Like, you had an
[50:25.580 --> 50:27.640]  Xbox Live account for three years you didn't know about.
[50:28.160 --> 50:29.680]  You were paying ten bucks a month for it, Gav, or whatever.
[50:30.140 --> 50:31.740]  Yeah. Gav into USA.
[50:32.420 --> 50:32.780]  Yeah.
[50:33.680 --> 50:35.480]  And I bought a month's worth,
[50:35.480 --> 50:37.600]  so it was renewing at the... I think it was renewing
[50:37.600 --> 50:39.400]  at ten dollars a month, and I forgot
[50:39.400 --> 50:41.520]  about it for three
[50:41.520 --> 50:43.180]  years. Livid about it.
[50:43.440 --> 50:45.420]  And it was for one video. It was just to make
[50:45.420 --> 50:46.940]  that Worms video before my
[50:47.580 --> 50:49.480]  account could migrate over to the US
[50:49.480 --> 50:51.180]  or something. I had to make an interim account.
[50:51.840 --> 50:53.480]  Mhm. I bought DLC
[50:54.220 --> 50:55.460]  for a Call of Duty game
[50:55.460 --> 50:57.480]  I never ended up buying. That has
[50:57.480 --> 50:58.500]  haunted me to this day.
[50:59.440 --> 51:01.320]  I spent ten dollars on DLC
[51:01.320 --> 51:03.700]  thinking, oh... You own the DLC for...
[51:03.700 --> 51:05.720]  I own a piece of DLC
[51:05.720 --> 51:07.860]  for Call of Duty World at War, because I was like
[51:07.860 --> 51:09.540]  yeah, I'll buy that game again down the road.
[51:09.660 --> 51:11.560]  And I never bought it again, but I'm still mindful
[51:11.560 --> 51:13.580]  and aware of the fact that I bought that DLC
[51:13.580 --> 51:15.900]  and I never played it. Does it let you buy
[51:15.900 --> 51:17.800]  the DLC? Yeah, it was just
[51:17.800 --> 51:19.800]  because it was like a digital... This was 360
[51:19.800 --> 51:21.780]  era, so not a lot of digital full game
[51:21.780 --> 51:23.500]  purchases, but you would download the DLC.
[51:23.720 --> 51:24.960]  So I bought like some
[51:25.500 --> 51:27.760]  map pack or like zombies... I don't know what I bought.
[51:27.840 --> 51:29.840]  I bought a piece of DLC for World at War
[51:29.840 --> 51:31.920]  and I'd already played it and returned
[51:31.920 --> 51:33.940]  it at that point, and I planned on buying it
[51:33.940 --> 51:35.900]  again, and I just never did that
[51:35.900 --> 51:37.860]  part. So I own the DLC and have never played it.
[51:38.200 --> 51:39.980]  It was probably zombie related, because I
[51:39.980 --> 51:42.000]  think that was the first Call of Duty
[51:42.000 --> 51:43.840]  to introduce zombies, if I remember correctly.
[51:44.280 --> 51:45.940]  I feel like it was a thing where I saw like
[51:45.940 --> 51:47.700]  oh, there's some zombie DLC,
[51:47.880 --> 51:49.920]  I could get some achievements in this, this'll be fun,
[51:49.980 --> 51:51.920]  I bought it, and then I never followed through and
[51:51.920 --> 51:53.540]  bought the actual game to play it.
[51:54.020 --> 51:55.720]  You should go back and get those achievements now.
[51:56.240 --> 51:57.980]  I'm still... I'm just trying to get 50 cent.
[51:58.380 --> 52:00.060]  Why is that not part of the redemption year?
[52:00.060 --> 52:02.000]  Because I really don't want to play
[52:02.000 --> 52:03.000]  Call of Duty World at War.
[52:04.560 --> 52:05.960]  That game made me quit
[52:05.960 --> 52:08.200]  playing Call of Duty games. Campaigns.
[52:08.300 --> 52:09.940]  The respawn? Didn't they change the
[52:09.940 --> 52:11.760]  respawn in that one? Where it's like
[52:11.760 --> 52:13.900]  they would not stop
[52:13.900 --> 52:15.320]  respawning, no matter how many you killed?
[52:15.320 --> 52:17.260]  Yeah, I was like
[52:17.260 --> 52:19.980]  playing it on veteran or whatever the hardest difficulty is, and I got
[52:19.980 --> 52:21.040]  stuck in this bunker
[52:21.940 --> 52:23.880]  on like a Normandy type level.
[52:24.000 --> 52:25.780]  It might have been Normandy if I remember, I don't know.
[52:25.800 --> 52:28.060]  It was so long ago. And I was like
[52:28.060 --> 52:29.780]  every time I tried to peek out, they would
[52:29.780 --> 52:32.100]  they would fucking peg me, and so I was just trying to figure
[52:32.100 --> 52:34.080]  out how to get out of it. And I was like stuck in there
[52:34.080 --> 52:35.660]  I had checkpointed, and I was trying to just figure out
[52:35.660 --> 52:38.340]  how do I... you know, like everything I tried
[52:39.020 --> 52:39.340]  uh
[52:40.620 --> 52:42.140]  failed, but I was safe in the
[52:42.140 --> 52:44.120]  bunker. And then after like five minutes
[52:44.120 --> 52:46.080]  they just started spawning grenades in the
[52:46.080 --> 52:48.020]  bunker. And I was like, alright assholes!
[52:48.240 --> 52:50.280]  That sucks. Fuck you. I'm done.
[52:50.560 --> 52:51.800]  And so I never went back. I don't
[52:51.800 --> 52:53.980]  know that I played another Call of Duty campaign
[52:53.980 --> 52:55.580]  after that for years, probably.
[52:55.580 --> 52:57.620]  They're fucking expensive to buy
[52:57.620 --> 52:59.340]  digitally still. They like just
[52:59.340 --> 53:01.440]  they only sell like the ultra bundle
[53:01.440 --> 53:03.800]  it's still like 50 bucks to buy World at War.
[53:04.020 --> 53:04.780]  Fucking Nick!
[53:05.360 --> 53:07.580]  Nick said he's eaten a lot of apples, but he's
[53:07.580 --> 53:09.540]  never picked one from a tree. That's a good point.
[53:09.920 --> 53:11.720]  You've never? Okay, well this will
[53:11.720 --> 53:13.700]  this will lead to another thing. There is
[53:14.540 --> 53:15.440]  something... the apple
[53:15.440 --> 53:17.340]  experience is enhanced
[53:17.340 --> 53:19.520]  when you pick it from the tree. I don't care if
[53:19.520 --> 53:21.460]  you're baking it, like if you're picking
[53:21.460 --> 53:23.260]  your own apples and then turning it into a pie
[53:23.260 --> 53:25.240]  better than any other pie you'll have
[53:25.240 --> 53:27.340]  anywhere else. I feel sad for Nick.
[53:27.680 --> 53:29.660]  Bullshit! No, it's
[53:29.660 --> 53:31.360]  just a thing. Legally
[53:31.360 --> 53:33.080]  or scrumped, it's always a little bit better scrumped.
[53:33.300 --> 53:35.460]  Look, go and pick some apples off a tree
[53:35.460 --> 53:37.300]  Yeah. I'll make a pie
[53:37.300 --> 53:39.200]  with them, and I'll also make a pie with some
[53:39.200 --> 53:41.360]  apples that I got. And you
[53:41.360 --> 53:42.840]  you're saying you could tell the difference.
[53:43.380 --> 53:45.060]  I could tell the difference, yeah, absolutely.
[53:45.200 --> 53:47.440]  It's a vibe thing. You can just, it feel
[53:47.440 --> 53:48.460]  Utter nonsense.
[53:48.960 --> 53:51.160]  Okay, well you ought to hear another thing that
[53:51.160 --> 53:52.940]  you're gonna hate in the utter nonsense
[53:52.940 --> 53:55.020]  category. It was snowing.
[53:55.120 --> 53:56.580]  It snowed here a few days ago.
[53:57.100 --> 53:59.100]  And I realized that Coca-Cola tastes
[53:59.100 --> 54:00.420]  better when it's snowing outside.
[54:03.020 --> 54:03.480]  If...
[54:03.480 --> 54:04.820]  Specifically when it's in a can.
[54:05.340 --> 54:06.940]  A Coca-Cola, a Coke
[54:06.940 --> 54:09.020]  in the snow in a can form
[54:09.020 --> 54:11.340]  is my snow beverage of choice.
[54:11.800 --> 54:13.080]  Is it because of the ads
[54:13.080 --> 54:15.100]  with like Santa and all that? It could be
[54:15.100 --> 54:17.060]  like, yeah, the polar bears, like it could
[54:17.060 --> 54:19.020]  be part of it. I can't explain to you
[54:19.020 --> 54:20.780]  why, but it tastes better.
[54:21.220 --> 54:22.580]  It tastes better when it's snowing.
[54:22.940 --> 54:24.980]  I'm gonna support both of those statements,
[54:25.100 --> 54:27.040]  Andrew. I'm with you on both of those.
[54:27.140 --> 54:28.980]  The apple and the Coke.
[54:29.360 --> 54:31.080]  I'm not saying the vibe doesn't
[54:31.080 --> 54:32.780]  like increase the enjoyment, but there's
[54:32.780 --> 54:34.980]  no way it transfers to the taste.
[54:35.460 --> 54:36.720]  It's all part of the experience.
[54:36.900 --> 54:39.020]  Once again, we're talking to the guy that fucking
[54:39.020 --> 54:40.920]  hates tasting anything. There's
[54:40.920 --> 54:43.060]  less food, you're not a food guy in any way.
[54:43.120 --> 54:44.860]  You think it's all the same. Rate an apple
[54:44.860 --> 54:46.200]  sixes across the board.
[54:47.220 --> 54:47.980]  No kidding.
[54:48.100 --> 54:50.200]  You live in fear
[54:50.200 --> 54:51.540]  of turkey sandwiches, for Christ's sake.
[54:55.360 --> 54:56.180]  I feel like you're
[54:56.180 --> 54:58.160]  the worst person. Like, I agree with what you're
[54:58.160 --> 55:00.340]  saying. Like, I understand it isn't
[55:00.340 --> 55:01.640]  true, but it is true.
[55:02.060 --> 55:04.260]  Like, it's not true. It makes no sense. It shouldn't be true.
[55:04.340 --> 55:06.100]  But in my heart, it is true.
[55:07.080 --> 55:08.300]  I would say the snow thing
[55:08.300 --> 55:10.260]  is more likely to be true because potentially
[55:10.260 --> 55:12.020]  the air tastes different when it's snowing.
[55:12.480 --> 55:13.280]  I was inside.
[55:13.280 --> 55:14.480]  I was inside.
[55:16.220 --> 55:17.020]  I think...
[55:17.020 --> 55:19.340]  I think what we should
[55:20.240 --> 55:20.640]  do...
[55:22.080 --> 55:22.880]  I think...
[55:23.680 --> 55:24.860]  I like that I try and
[55:24.860 --> 55:27.400]  the 1% of the conversation I can
[55:27.400 --> 55:28.800]  defend him with, he's like, no.
[55:33.320 --> 55:34.960]  I've been, uh...
[55:34.960 --> 55:37.420]  I'll just do all the food. I got a cheese
[55:37.420 --> 55:39.280]  advent calendar. I've been
[55:39.280 --> 55:41.180]  exploring cheese. I'm not a che...
[55:41.180 --> 55:43.240]  I don't... I've never really had cheese before.
[55:43.520 --> 55:45.080]  Say it. It's fine. Say it. I'm not a cheese guy.
[55:45.160 --> 55:47.280]  You can say it. I'm not a cheese guy. But I am a cheese
[55:47.280 --> 55:49.180]  guy. I'm a very specific cheese guy. I like it
[55:49.180 --> 55:51.100]  melted. And I still am holding that
[55:51.100 --> 55:52.980]  opinion. Are we talking like a British
[55:52.980 --> 55:55.180]  cheese advent calendar? We are.
[55:55.400 --> 55:57.160]  Yes. It is a British cheese advent calendar.
[55:57.160 --> 55:59.360]  I can already tell you which is the best one in there.
[55:59.860 --> 56:00.600]  And I want to see if you agree.
[56:00.740 --> 56:03.160]  What is the best one? The best cheese in
[56:03.160 --> 56:04.420]  there is smoked applewood.
[56:05.580 --> 56:07.220]  I enjoy the smell of
[56:07.220 --> 56:08.400]  smoked applewood a lot.
[56:09.120 --> 56:10.120]  Cheese is fine.
[56:10.500 --> 56:11.940]  It's okay. It's not bad.
[56:12.380 --> 56:14.520]  Interesting. Because that's the best
[56:14.520 --> 56:16.460]  if we were doing a... if I was
[56:16.460 --> 56:18.460]  keeping a list of my top seven
[56:18.460 --> 56:20.280]  cheeses a secret from you and you found
[56:20.280 --> 56:22.660]  my secret document, smoked applewood
[56:22.660 --> 56:24.260]  would be number one. Really?
[56:24.380 --> 56:26.520]  That's your number one cheese? Number one cheese
[56:26.520 --> 56:28.500]  in the world. Phenomenal. Oh, you should tell
[56:28.500 --> 56:30.380]  that to the celebrity cheese bonger, dude.
[56:30.800 --> 56:32.600]  Oh, you know what's exciting about that
[56:32.600 --> 56:34.480]  box, Gavin? I don't remember what it's
[56:34.480 --> 56:36.460]  called. I'm not going to pull it out
[56:36.460 --> 56:38.360]  because I'd have to move my mic to get it.
[56:39.820 --> 56:40.220]  Um...
[56:41.100 --> 56:42.520]  My mic stand is in front
[56:42.520 --> 56:44.420]  of my fridge and it would be a whole thing to
[56:44.420 --> 56:46.500]  like pull the box out. One of the cheeses
[56:46.500 --> 56:48.640]  in that box, talk about coincidences,
[56:48.860 --> 56:50.540]  is the same cheese they use
[56:50.540 --> 56:52.440]  when they race cheese, when they roll it down the hill for
[56:52.440 --> 56:53.980]  the cheese race. Oh.
[56:54.420 --> 56:55.820]  So it's all connected. Yes.
[56:56.460 --> 56:58.020]  I don't remember what it is.
[56:58.260 --> 57:00.200]  But what is this? The man who asked
[57:00.200 --> 57:02.620]  400 celebrities for their... there's a cheese guy?
[57:03.120 --> 57:04.640]  He's famous. He spans
[57:04.640 --> 57:06.420]  every celebrity on Twitter
[57:06.420 --> 57:08.520]  to ask them what their favorite cheese is and then he records it
[57:08.520 --> 57:09.500]  and puts it in his cheese book.
[57:10.420 --> 57:12.620]  He's got like a crazy amount of celebrities
[57:12.620 --> 57:14.640]  that have responded to him. I'll just throw it out there
[57:14.640 --> 57:16.240]  for later. I don't want to interrupt your story now. No.
[57:16.360 --> 57:18.340]  This is an important addition.
[57:18.580 --> 57:19.940]  I just... Joe Bangles.
[57:20.620 --> 57:22.680]  I feel like the advent calendar is underutilized.
[57:23.020 --> 57:24.640]  Like as somebody who doesn't...
[57:24.640 --> 57:26.680]  I would never opt to just have
[57:26.680 --> 57:28.340]  cheese. Like I wouldn't order a cheese plate.
[57:28.680 --> 57:30.460]  I get a little bit of cheese every day.
[57:30.720 --> 57:33.080]  I'm expanding my food horizons.
[57:33.080 --> 57:35.160]  Do you also get a stupid joke on the inside
[57:35.160 --> 57:37.180]  of the door? No, it's just like a little thing
[57:37.180 --> 57:38.680]  you can color in if you want to.
[57:38.940 --> 57:41.040]  There's no joke. But I just... I feel like... I don't know
[57:41.040 --> 57:43.200]  why advent calendars are just Christmas
[57:43.200 --> 57:44.480]  related. I would buy
[57:45.060 --> 57:46.860]  a cheese calendar for February.
[57:47.500 --> 57:49.080]  If that makes sense. Should we have
[57:49.080 --> 57:50.700]  the official f***ed face
[57:50.700 --> 57:52.800]  February cheese calendar?
[57:54.280 --> 57:55.240]  I just think
[57:55.240 --> 57:57.040]  that it's a fun way to try things
[57:57.040 --> 57:59.200]  that I'm on the fence about. I feel like I could
[57:59.200 --> 58:01.200]  like cold cheese. I will say
[58:01.200 --> 58:02.980]  I started... I picked this up on the
[58:02.980 --> 58:05.200]  8th of December. I ate the first one
[58:05.200 --> 58:07.420]  I ate. A basic cheddar by itself.
[58:07.700 --> 58:09.420]  I ate the apple smoke.
[58:09.680 --> 58:11.140]  Your favorite, Gavin. I tried that
[58:11.140 --> 58:13.080]  by itself. I then took
[58:13.080 --> 58:14.820]  days three
[58:14.820 --> 58:17.280]  through six. Put them on a thing
[58:17.280 --> 58:19.260]  of grilled cheese. Melted them. Just melted
[58:19.260 --> 58:20.560]  them on top of it. It was delicious.
[58:21.060 --> 58:23.100]  I think melted cheese is better. That sounds
[58:23.100 --> 58:24.720]  pretty good. I feel like
[58:24.720 --> 58:26.920]  it's a good way to try stuff because
[58:26.920 --> 58:29.140]  you've got a natural palate cleanse between
[58:29.140 --> 58:31.000]  every bite of 24 hours.
[58:31.100 --> 58:32.580]  You do. Absolutely.
[58:32.940 --> 58:35.180]  And it's just an exciting thing. You wake up. You get
[58:35.180 --> 58:37.240]  to open a compartment. You don't know what's in it.
[58:37.660 --> 58:39.060]  It's great. I think it's
[58:39.060 --> 58:41.080]  dumb that they are only a December holiday
[58:41.080 --> 58:43.080]  thing. I have one. Emily made
[58:43.080 --> 58:44.980]  one for me. It's a house. And it's
[58:44.980 --> 58:47.180]  not cheese though. It's candy. But I get
[58:47.180 --> 58:49.000]  different candies every day. It's f***ing awesome.
[58:49.220 --> 58:51.340]  That's very sweet. I do like
[58:51.340 --> 58:53.060]  I did some research
[58:53.060 --> 58:55.120]  online. Any website that
[58:55.120 --> 58:57.040]  recommends a build your own, go f*** yourself.
[58:57.500 --> 58:58.500]  Go f*** yourself.
[58:58.680 --> 59:00.760]  If you have somebody who's willing to do it for you,
[59:00.940 --> 59:03.060]  there's nothing more insulting than
[59:03.060 --> 59:04.680]  trying to find a good advent calendar.
[59:04.860 --> 59:07.100]  Make it yourself. I could buy
[59:07.100 --> 59:08.960]  a million of those. Why are you recommending
[59:08.960 --> 59:09.520]  this to me?
[59:10.800 --> 59:12.160]  I f***ing hate it.
[59:13.120 --> 59:14.520]  So are you a big advent guy?
[59:15.220 --> 59:17.100]  I'm a big December guy.
[59:17.320 --> 59:19.180]  I love everything about it. I love the movies.
[59:20.380 --> 59:21.180]  We've talked about
[59:21.180 --> 59:22.780]  this. The greatest stretch of the year
[59:22.780 --> 59:25.060]  is October through December.
[59:25.060 --> 59:27.120]  This is your favorite time of the year.
[59:27.280 --> 59:29.120]  This is my favorite time of the year. I'm gonna get
[59:29.120 --> 59:30.940]  some Christmas lights later in the day.
[59:31.120 --> 59:32.060]  Oh, it's gonna be great.
[59:32.600 --> 59:34.800]  A new Halo came out. Can I tell Geoff
[59:34.800 --> 59:36.240]  what you said
[59:36.760 --> 59:38.860]  when the new Halo came out? Absolutely.
[59:39.840 --> 59:40.960]  We'll see if Geoff
[59:40.960 --> 59:43.020]  is as annoyed as you were by this statement.
[59:43.100 --> 59:44.100]  I think it makes sense.
[59:44.740 --> 59:46.640]  Yesterday, at the time of this recording,
[59:46.780 --> 59:49.240]  the Halo Infinite campaign came out.
[59:49.840 --> 59:50.060]  Yeah.
[59:50.440 --> 59:52.600]  I hadn't seen any of it.
[59:52.600 --> 59:54.640]  I avoid trailers.
[59:54.860 --> 59:56.940]  I avoid people's opinions. I just wanna go insane.
[59:57.680 --> 59:58.280]  Loving it.
[59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.780]  I feel like it's...
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:01.820]  I'm not gonna talk about the game.
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:03.680]  I was talking to Andrew about the game,
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.280]  and he said,
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.220]  this makes me want a new Halo game.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:10.400]  I said,
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:12.380]  this game is so good, I want a new Halo game.
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:14.820]  On the day a new Halo game came out,
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:16.520]  he was like, man, I wish there was
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.280]  another Halo game.
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:20.800]  See, this is how Left 4 Dead 2 happened, and everybody was all up in arms.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:21.760]  Alright.
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:25.080]  I would love it if you guys...
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:27.120]  I'm making a...
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.580]  I'm gonna do my best
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.100]  not to play it.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.220]  So I'm gonna try not to know anything about it.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:34.500]  I'm waiting for co-op.
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:37.140]  Millie and I had already planned...
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:39.280]  I have played every Halo game
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.180]  at launch in co-op
[01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:43.120]  with the people that are most important to me
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:43.760]  at the time.
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.920]  And many of them were you, Gav.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:50.760]  And...
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:52.320]  I really,
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:54.740]  really, really was looking forward to playing it
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:56.780]  with Millicent. You know, we went through in preparation
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.060]  and played all the Halo games together.
[01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:00.320]  It became like a really sweet bonding thing.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.700]  And so, I don't want my
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.800]  first experience playing a new Halo
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.100]  game with my daughter.
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:08.060]  Uh...
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:10.800]  Or rather, I want a first experience of playing a new Halo
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.700]  game with my daughter. And to have it be new
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:13.840]  for both of us at the same time.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:16.940]  So I'm gonna wait for the fuckin' co-op
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:18.300]  six months or whatever.
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.020]  It's gonna be the hardest thing I've ever done
[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:21.280]  considering I have a career
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:24.000]  thanks to Halo. You know,
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:26.380]  in many parts. But, it is what it is
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:27.920]  I guess. So now, I will
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.100]  expand on my comment
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:31.820]  without, I feel, spoiling
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:34.180]  anything. And we talked about it
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:36.120]  a little bit. Geoff and I apologize if I spoiled
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.220]  anything for you. Not at all. You just, you said
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:40.040]  you like the grappling hook. That's fine. I like that.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:41.660]  The grappling hook is incredible.
[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:44.000]  But, when I played it, when you play it,
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:46.420]  when you hit, I think it's the most innovative
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:48.320]  Halo game. Even though a lot of the things
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.640]  in part were in previous Halos.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.580]  They've never been combined in the way
[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:54.800]  it is in this game. And it took
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.540]  like six years for
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:58.600]  this to release. It was the longest gap between
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.540]  Halo games. And it's one of
[01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:02.640]  those things where you know it was a development
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.440]  hell. Like, it was very widely reported that
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.280]  this was a fucking mess of a game to make.
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:07.400]  But it's fantastic.
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:10.740]  I don't wanna wait six more years
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:12.440]  for what the next step of this is.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.440]  Like, it's so great. There's so many things
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.580]  I love about it, but there are also so many things
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:18.540]  you can see where the next step
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:20.540]  of it will so clearly be an improvement
[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:22.820]  on what they have. Like, they have the framework
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:24.760]  beautifully done, but there's
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.500]  depth they could add to the world
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.360]  and kind of the experience as a whole
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.580]  that I think would make it genuinely
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.760]  one of my favorite games of all time.
[01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:34.680]  And so I'm excited about that
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.580]  and I wanna be, I wish I was
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:38.580]  in a space where Halo Infinite was like
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:40.560]  Halo 5. And I'm
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:42.560]  anticipating what will be what I
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.560]  think possibly my favorite Halo
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.620]  game ever made. I can completely
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:48.500]  understand what you're saying there. I feel like
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.520]  Halo Reach was that for
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.560]  Halo 3. Like, I feel like it was an improvement
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.440]  in every way. Not a
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.460]  reinvention, but just like a refinement of
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:58.580]  what they had. And then ODST and
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:00.500]  4 were very different games in their own right, and that's
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.500]  cool. But like, I totally get what you're saying. You
[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.000]  wanna see like the
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.800]  next, the iteratively improved
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:08.580]  iteratively improved version
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.400]  of what you just played. Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.420]  Like, in a way that they took
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:14.320]  such a step forward, and it
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.260]  like, they have the framework to
[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.400]  I feel like this game opens them
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.700]  up to take it in so many different
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:22.340]  directions as far as the design
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.520]  goes in the future. And I'm so excited
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.380]  to see that evolution that I
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:28.400]  wish that there was a Halo game in
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.420]  development right now. Those people deserve like
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:32.360]  a huge break. It's been a nightmare to make it
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.100]  apparently, and it's the holidays.
[01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:36.380]  Like, they deserve time. Realistically, I
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.420]  want them to like relax and just enjoy
[01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:40.260]  themselves. But for my own
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:42.280]  selfishness, I would be so
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:44.160]  excited to know that there is a Halo game
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.300]  that is expanding on what we currently
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:48.160]  have, like two years in development.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.500]  And then it's around the corner.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.440]  I'm so excited for it. Like, Halo Infinite
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.700]  has brought back
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.140]  a passion I have for the series
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:58.420]  as a whole that I didn't know
[01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:00.420]  I could regain. I love
[01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:01.820]  those games so much, and it kind of
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:04.400]  I don't know, I fell out of that, and I'm
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.420]  so happy to be back in it, and just so
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:08.220]  generally excited about Halo.
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:09.940]  I've been having so much fun with Infinite.
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:11.920]  Yeah, I feel like I can't give
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.380]  any opinions. It's like the one area
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:16.420]  where I can see that I
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:18.220]  am just a fanboy of Halo. And
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:20.120]  when a Halo game is good,
[01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:22.400]  I would give this game 10 out of 10, based
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.380]  on what I've seen so far. I don't want to over
[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:25.880]  hype it for people who aren't into Halo, but
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.020]  I love it.
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:30.220]  I'll post a link to a clip
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.400]  briefly. I don't think this
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.260]  is necessarily the most interesting thing.
[01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:36.400]  I'd just like to see your reaction
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.380]  to it, Geoff. And I don't feel like this is
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:39.860]  literally just me grappling
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:42.040]  hooks. I'm using the grappling hook thing.
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.160]  It's fucking crazy. Halo
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.100]  Infinite is like a
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:48.120]  Spider-Man game. It is
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.180]  so much fun. You said if you had
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:51.940]  a second grappling hook, it would be the best
[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:54.160]  Spider-Man game ever made. It is
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.380]  so much fun, because I had to...
[01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:58.400]  the way that they can design
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.100]  the game now, it's not flat
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:02.320]  in the same way. This is just beautiful.
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.180]  It looks beautiful,
[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:06.220]  and the movement of it is
[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:08.420]  so unlike any other Halo experience.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:10.480]  You could play Halo
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.340]  Reach, and there is some difference
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:13.840]  in the movement, but it's fundamentally
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.580]  the levels are designed the same, and you have the same limitations.
[01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:18.160]  And Halo Infinite,
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.340]  I need to climb a mountain, and I can just fucking
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:22.080]  zip line up it, and it's fluid,
[01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:24.360]  and it feels great. Dude, it looks
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:26.020]  like you're climbing out of Valhalla.
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:27.900]  It's fucking awesome.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.280]  And the thing that Bungie was really
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.280]  good at, is that if there was a piece of geometry
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.220]  in the distance, you could
[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:36.300]  kind of always walk on it. A lot of games would just
[01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.180]  put in some weird translucent
[01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:40.280]  clipping through background stuff.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.300]  If you found a way up the map in the
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:44.320]  original Halo games, even if you weren't supposed to,
[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:46.380]  you could actually walk out to all these places.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:48.300]  And now it's available, and
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:50.280]  it's part of the game, and it feels amazing.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.260]  That's such a great example of it, of like
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:54.320]  yeah, not only can you get there, but you can get
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.040]  there, and you might find a thing there.
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:58.220]  And there might be a mission, and that is so
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:05:59.720]  cool to me. And it's not
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:02.280]  the deepest those mechanics, and those
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.140]  were the things where I was like, wow. With
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:06.080]  this framework, and expanding on this,
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.460]  adding more depth to just the world as a whole,
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.300]  I'm so excited for
[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.500]  where Halo will go. And I wish it was here already.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:14.540]  That's sort of the sentiment I was trying to make.
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:16.280]  The thing that excites me
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.660]  about it, just watching that clip,
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:20.220]  and just
[01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:22.060]  thinking about when I'm eventually going to get to play it, is
[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:24.260]  the best part of Halo to me
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:26.280]  is after I've beaten the game five or six
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:28.220]  times, and you're just exploring, and
[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:30.280]  looking for Easter eggs, and you're just looking for
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.360]  just weird shit, and trying
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:33.800]  to break the map, and trying to get
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.100]  places where you're not supposed to, and just
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:37.620]  exploring, just because
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.160]  you want more of the world,
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:42.200]  right? I've walked around Halo
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.300]  so many maps, so much of
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.380]  my life has been spent walking around
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:48.280]  Halo, looking for sets
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:50.260]  and shit for Red vs. Blue, but also
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:51.540]  just wanting to
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.300]  spend five more minutes in the world, and
[01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:56.060]  see something new that I hadn't seen, you know?
[01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:58.340]  And it looks like that is what this game
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:00.300]  is. Yeah, it's like they've brought
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:02.400]  the attitude you take into
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.360]  your sixth playthrough, and they've applied it
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.320]  to your first playthrough. It's
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.360]  encouraged, and it feels great just
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:09.900]  to piss off and walk around.
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:12.300]  I'm very excited to play it someday.
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:13.680]  We're a Halo podcast.
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:15.700]  I would be fine with that.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.400]  Hey, when we go to
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.260]  Vancouver sometime next
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:22.160]  year, so that we can go crabbing,
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.280]  and do the bathtub race,
[01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:26.420]  we should also plant a tree.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:27.080]  We should.
[01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:27.900]  Absolutely.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.320]  Once I thought of that, I was like, I need to plant a tree.
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:33.900]  What tree would you go for?
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:35.740]  That is...
[01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:38.380]  Apple tree?
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:40.440]  What's the official f*** face tree?
[01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:42.180]  Could you just plant
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:42.920]  a Cosmic Crisp?
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:45.820]  I guess I could, theoretically.
[01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:46.740]  I don't know if I would.
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.780]  It was unfortunate. I discovered the greatest
[01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:51.140]  apple pairing of all time, Geoff.
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.660]  I invented something as soon as we stopped recording.
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.720]  Let me tell you about the Cosmic
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.700]  Lady. Take one bite of a
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:07:59.780]  Cosmic Crisp, you take one bite of a
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:01.280]  Pink Lady, what a blend.
[01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:03.860]  That's a great combo. I highly recommend
[01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:04.820]  it to anybody out there.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.300]  After you were saying that last week,
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:09.740]  was it someone here saying
[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:11.400]  they didn't like peanut butter with apple?
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.040]  Me.
[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:15.560]  I feel like that's...
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.020]  peanut butter is a decent pairing.
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:18.780]  I didn't have it until I moved here, but
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:20.260]  it's pretty common from what I've seen.
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.400]  What if you took your four favorite apples
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:24.640]  into quadrants and glued them together
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.320]  with peanut butter? Do you think
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:28.120]  that would be the best apple of all time?
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:30.600]  No. I don't like the peanut butter.
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.400]  I don't understand that part of it.
[01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:35.020]  If you take four things you like
[01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:36.840]  separately and then connect them all
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.620]  with the thing you don't like, will that be the best?
[01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:40.240]  Most people like that.
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.920]  And if you're saying two apples
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.840]  in your mouth at the same time taste really good,
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.080]  that could be the ultimate snack.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:48.600]  Oh, I see.
[01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:50.620]  It's like your glove,
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:52.060]  but it's apples and peanut butter.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.780]  Oh, Nick says you could do caramel instead.
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:58.580]  You could do caramel.
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:00.920]  Or honey or something. You could build...
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.520]  Andrew, you could construct
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.100]  the ultimate apple.
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:06.740]  I like this idea. Like the apple prime.
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:07.360]  Yeah.
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:09.740]  The infinity apple.
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:13.300]  Yeah, the infinity apple.
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:14.140]  That's what you're making.
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:17.380]  We should find which four quadrants of four different
[01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:19.500]  apples make the ultimate mega apple.
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:21.020]  The infinity apple.
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:22.960]  The Voltron of apples.
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:25.580]  Since we're an Apple podcast, I want it known
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:27.240]  we need to mark December 9th.
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:28.680]  We said we're gonna do this last week.
[01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:31.240]  I have a Cosmic Crisp. I'm putting it in my fridge
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.220]  and I will not touch it until one year from now.
[01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:34.980]  Oh, I gotta do that right now too.
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.980]  Uh, shit. Let me go do that. I'll be right back.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.680]  Are we gonna go put our apples in?
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.020]  Mine's on my desk at work.
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:42.220]  Oh, Gavin.
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:43.400]  Are we gonna push another week?
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.480]  No, no, no. I'll just be a week behind.
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.060]  He will get to witness
[01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:50.140]  us and then he will get to
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:51.760]  have the experience himself the following week.
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:54.220]  And he's committed to it. So no matter how it turns
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:56.040]  out, Gavin then needs to try the apple
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:56.840]  a week after we do.
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.760]  Alright, well I'll be right back. I'm gonna go put my apple in the fridge
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:00.660]  right now.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:02.900]  I'm gonna go in tomorrow and get my apple.
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:05.760]  I opened the fridge. Can I see
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:06.820]  my cheese thing?
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:08.960]  I can't. Damn it.
[01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:11.000]  You know, when I got the advent
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.920]  calendar, I opened... I didn't
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:15.040]  realize... So it has
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:17.060]  like, you know one of those pull strips on cardboard
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:18.060]  to like open? Yeah.
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.860]  I didn't notice it had one, so I just opened
[01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:22.380]  the bottom and I pulled it out.
[01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:24.840]  And it was just this plastic piece of cardboard
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:26.260]  with cheese sticking out of it.
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.680]  And it was so ugly. And I was like, there's no way
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:30.000]  that this is just what it is.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:32.800]  And then I realized that the calendar part,
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:34.700]  you have to pull the top and then it opens
[01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:36.680]  and I just had to slide the cheese back in.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.640]  You just had the weird guts of the advent calendar.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.760]  Yeah, I had the weird guts of the advent calendar
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:42.640]  and I know somebody else who had it
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.660]  and I was paranoid that I put it in backwards
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:46.740]  and that I was eating 24 on day one.
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:48.420]  And so...
[01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:50.780]  You wanted to match up with the other person
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:52.120]  so you could share the experience?
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.580]  Yeah, I was like, oh man, what was
[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:55.900]  the cheese you got on day one?
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:58.720]  I was trying to casually bring it up so I didn't say
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:10:59.980]  that I had to explain.
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.300]  They're like, oh, it's the same. Okay, good. I did it.
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:03.460]  I didn't fuck it up.
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:04.900]  I'm not eating backwards.
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:07.920]  Although that could be fun
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:10.520]  if you ate a cheese calendar one way
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.120]  I ate it the other way, meet up in the middle
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.000]  see what we got, talk about the experience
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.080]  exchange information.
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:17.740]  What a journey.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.040]  Eating backwards.
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:21.900]  Eating backwards. I did a...
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:24.160]  I don't know if I should talk about this.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.340]  People were not happy with me.
[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:27.200]  People got angry. Why not?
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:30.400]  I did a thing. I did a food thing.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.140]  This is a little old at this point
[01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:34.360]  but I've been meaning to talk about it on the show.
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:36.680]  This is something you did publicly?
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:37.220]  People know about it?
[01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:38.580]  This is a thing I did publicly.
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.380]  I'll just post it here.
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.720]  I'm going to advise. I'm going to be up front.
[01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:45.720]  The first thing I'm going to say
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.280]  was it's delicious.
[01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:49.840]  The second thing I'm going to say...
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.140]  I'm prepared to be disgusted.
[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:52.560]  No, I don't think it...
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:56.360]  It's delicious.
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.120]  Don't do it.
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:59.740]  That's going to be my second thing.
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:01.440]  It's delicious.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.020]  People were mad at you.
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:05.940]  They were mad. They're mad at me.
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:08.380]  This was an invention I came up with.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.100]  Heating marshmallows...
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:11.060]  Okay.
[01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:12.280]  Okay.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.180]  Wax is fuel.
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:18.240]  So this is the thing.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.400]  You're going to be burning...
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.360]  You might as well do it over a piece...
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:24.360]  That can't be healthy.
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.420]  Well, that's...
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:27.900]  Yeah, that was sort of my thought.
[01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:29.400]  That was sort of my thought.
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:30.580]  So this is how it started.
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:33.140]  I learned that there are devices that you can buy.
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:35.660]  I say devices like it's fucking advanced technology.
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.960]  You can buy things to melt marshmallows.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.340]  They're like metal. They're shitty.
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:40.060]  They're like $40.
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:42.940]  And you can heat marshmallows indoors with them.
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:45.100]  And I was like, I don't really want to pay $40 for that.
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:48.480]  But a melted marshmallow, like a little bit burnt marshmallow...
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.260]  Oh, it's delicious.
[01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:51.280]  So I was thinking, how could I do this?
[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:52.700]  I had an apple on my desk.
[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:54.480]  I had a fork and I had a candle.
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:57.520]  I was like, ah, I wonder if I could make this work.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:04.280]  So between Halo games, I would throw my fork over the candle and I'd get a nice cook going.
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.420]  And yeah, there's a lot of ways...
[01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:07.940]  That fork got pretty hot too.
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:10.780]  Oh, the fork would get hot.
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:14.240]  It would be a problem sometimes when removing the marshmallow from the fork.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.080]  At the base, it wouldn't be too much of an issue.
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:17.180]  It'd take a while.
[01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:17.920]  Is that...
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:22.960]  Is that sitting on your scarlet that you use to record this podcast with?
[01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:25.280]  Uh, the fork is, yes.
[01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:26.520]  With the apple.
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:28.560]  The super heated fork?
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:29.500]  No, no, no.
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.400]  It's transferring all that heat down to that device?
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.320]  Into the other metal device?
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:37.200]  The hot fucking fork that's sitting on another metal device?
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:40.400]  You have never roasted a marshmallow over a candle, my friend.
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:41.360]  And it shows.
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.000]  It does not get that hot.
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.020]  Geoff, that's the heat sink for his fork.
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:47.260]  That's the heat sink for his fork.
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:50.040]  Yeah, the heat's being dispersed into the scarlet.
[01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:51.960]  No, there's no...
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.480]  You don't have to worry about that.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.880]  It's just the point in which it's over direct flame.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.480]  The fork itself doesn't get that hot.
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:00.160]  Do not do this for several reasons.
[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:02.600]  One, as you brought up, wax will get onto the candle.
[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:03.980]  I never tasted it.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.220]  I believe this was a soy wax blend.
[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:09.380]  And also the other issue is, uh...
[01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:10.120]  Some...
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:12.980]  Some wicks are made with lead in them.
[01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:15.000]  So do not avoid generalizing.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.380]  I don't think it's a common practice.
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:18.480]  I did not have...
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.820]  Mine was a completely natural wick.
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:22.060]  Zero lead.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:24.960]  Did you check that before, though?
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.680]  Oh, no, I had no idea that that was a thing.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.080]  I checked that after.
[01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:30.980]  How many marshmallows...
[01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:31.720]  How many...
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.800]  By the way, Nick says you might as well be cooking this on a tire fire.
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:35.580]  Which I agree.
[01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:37.300]  No, it's not nearly that bad.
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:40.380]  That is an extreme exaggeration.
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:43.000]  How many wax marshmallows...
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.740]  How many lead marshmallows would you say you ate?
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:45.660]  Three.
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:47.560]  I had three...
[01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:50.460]  I had some guy came at me of like,
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.580]  This fucking idiot's only gonna cook one side.
[01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:54.800]  Dummy, you don't think I flipped the fork over?
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.040]  You think that this is just how it is?
[01:14:57.380 --> 01:15:00.820]  Wait, how do you get the same position with the fork on its back?
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:02.420]  Oh, you gotta hold it at that point.
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.400]  At that point, you're holding it, or...
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.180]  Or you're, like, resting it on...
[01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:10.040]  I think I did something that was slightly taller than an apple.
[01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:10.960]  That you could try to.
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.260]  I did attempt that.
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:14.940]  And the fork slid into the candle.
[01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:17.420]  Okay.
[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:18.600]  I lost him.
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:20.980]  Every single week.
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:23.820]  This is what it's like to do a podcast with you, lately.
[01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:26.100]  Well, I didn't vanish, though.
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:27.800]  You're quiet about it.
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:30.720]  We should probably wrap it up.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.100]  Yeah, I was actually thinking, since...
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.240]  Should we end it while he's gone?
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:38.680]  Since Eric isn't here, we might as well do, like, a responsible wrap-up.
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:39.780]  And, like, an easy one.
[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:42.560]  Because it'll frustrate him that he didn't get to participate in it.
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:44.320]  Uh, so...
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:45.580]  Uh...
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.800]  Andrew's not here, anymore.
[01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:52.280]  We suspect, honestly, he might have burned his apartment down.
[01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:54.720]  With a candle, and...
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:55.620]  A fork.
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:57.180]  And, uh...
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:15:59.940]  It's s'mores, I guess.
[01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:02.160]  But...
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:03.700]  What was I doing?
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:05.340]  I like the idea of him aggressively saying,
[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:08.200]  No, dummy, of course I flipped my fork over.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.320]  As I cooked a marshmallow on a candle.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:10.920]  Dummy.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:12.720]  Oh, my God.
[01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:14.560]  I, uh...
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:18.000]  I don't know, I keep waiting for him to show back up.
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:20.340]  Because I don't actually want to end it with him not here.
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:21.500]  But he doesn't seem to be.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:22.500]  So, fuck it.
[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:24.460]  What if we end it, right?
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:27.140]  Then he comes back, and we don't tell him it ended.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:29.360]  Oh, I like that.
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:29.840]  And then he just keeps...
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:30.380]  Thank you!
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:31.740]  Sorry.
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:36.960]  Thank you for listening to yet another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:38.680]  Today we talked about a lot.
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:46.360]  I'll leave it up to the capable mouth of minor league fan Jack to perfectly surmise it in a different episode.
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:48.300]  But we really appreciate it.
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:53.440]  And if you like the podcast, if you wouldn't mind telling a friend, recommending it to somebody, we would really appreciate it.
[01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:53.960]  Rooster Teeth.
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.660]  This is our parent company.
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:57.720]  The family umbrella, as it were.
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:01.260]  It's a company that was literally built on word of mouth.
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:05.580]  It's how we survive, and it's how we fail as a company.
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:09.360]  So if you would be so kind as to spread the word, we would certainly appreciate it.
[01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:11.860]  Thank you very much. We love you, and we'll see you next week.
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:13.440]  You know what? I'd be interested.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.460]  If the comment leavers out there want to leave a comment,
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:20.900]  which episodes have you shown to other people to get them into this podcast?
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:23.720]  Because I'd be interested to know which one you picked.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.720]  Yeah, I would like that as well.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:30.280]  Like, what is the best episode to introduce someone to F***face?
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.080]  Because I guarantee it's not episode one.
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:34.200]  No, that's the thing. It's not episode one.
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.100]  And there's a lot of lore that runs throughout.
[01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:38.160]  So it's like, where do you jump them in?
[01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:40.340]  Where do you jump them in?
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:40.840]  Yeah.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:42.740]  That's confusing.
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:45.300]  Still no Andrew, huh?
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:47.000]  Shit.
[01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:50.080]  Oh, now he's just fucking gone.
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:50.660]  Oh, now he's back.
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:53.800]  Okay, so that was really unfortunate.
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:58.720]  You lost me, and then I came back relatively quickly,
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:02.500]  and I heard your whole dumb plan of pretending the show's still going on,
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:04.160]  even though it ended. I heard all of that.
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.260]  That wasn't a dumb plan.
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:08.720]  It was a ridiculous plan.
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.700]  What I forget is whenever it loses me,
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.620]  I need to leave the call to be able to speak again.
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:14.640]  So I was just waiting.
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:15.780]  I was waiting in the bushes.
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:17.740]  I could hear everything.
[01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:18.960]  I was listening to it all.
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:21.560]  I was waiting for my time to cut in and make my great line.
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:23.260]  And, uh, nothing.
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:26.020]  Just, I say it, and nothing picks up.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:27.540]  I didn't even say a great line.
[01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:30.140]  I was just gonna be like, so is this where we pretend that we end the podcast?
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:31.220]  And then nothing.
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:33.320]  Just, I can't say a thing.
[01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.880]  So then I need to leave.
[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:38.100]  It's like I need to scream from the bushes that I'm in the bushes
[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:39.540]  to then re-enter the bushes
[01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:40.680]  and be like, surprise!
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:42.320]  It ruined it.
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:45.000]  Hey, do you guys think we should go...
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.400]  We should do...
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.960]  I was thinking about this last week.
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.560]  Do you guys think sometime next year
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:51.000]  we should do an apple picking event?
[01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:53.500]  Where we go to like an orchard and we do like...
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:54.620]  Like when I do my apple trip.
[01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:56.980]  I'm saying, do you guys want to go on an apple trip with me next year?
[01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:59.260]  I would love to go on an apple trip with you.
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:01.140]  We could call it Scrump 2022.
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:04.460]  You know, I think that's a great fucking title.
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:05.580]  I love that.
[01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:06.680]  Scrump 2022.
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:08.840]  And that brings up a...
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.500]  I realize the episode ended already,
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:12.740]  but that brings up a question I have.
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:15.820]  Do you think there is an etymological connection
[01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:18.140]  between the word scrump
[01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:19.040]  or scrumping
[01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:21.020]  and scrumptious?
[01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:22.620]  What's scrumptious?
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:24.620]  You've never heard the term scrumptious?
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:26.720]  No. I've heard scrumptious.
[01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:29.000]  Scrumptious, scrumptious, however you want to say it.
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:31.820]  Scrumptious. Do you think there's a...
[01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:33.120]  I don't know.
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:35.100]  Geoff, I haven't heard the word, but maybe.
[01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:37.820]  That character
[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:39.200]  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:40.280]  truly scrumptious.
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:43.520]  Scrumptious. Scrumptious, scrumptious.
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:44.620]  I'm saying how it's spelled.
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:46.000]  I will say,
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.820]  in the past, Geoff, we've had disagreements
[01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:51.440]  and you've cited things like
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:53.300]  the dictionary to prove that you're right.
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:55.100]  And it is infuriating
[01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:57.580]  at times. You had my back on here
[01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:59.420]  regardless. Having the dictionary
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:01.480]  on your side is so much fun.
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:03.580]  When you're on the other side of it, people are
[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:05.480]  like, that's such a bullshit word. Just being able
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:07.520]  to be like, hey, you gotta go talk to the
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:09.440]  dictionary people. I'm just saying
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:11.560]  it. They backed it. It's not my fight.
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:13.980]  I may even agree with you, but it's there.
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:15.920]  So I sent you a scrumptious
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:18.060]  of food. Extremely tasty.
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:20.320]  Delicious. A scrumptious chocolate tart.
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:21.680]  Where did you send it?
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:23.220]  Oh, is it not in the thing?
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:25.620]  No. Where did you put it?
[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.220]  It's not. Weird.
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:29.160]  Modify attachment. Okay.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:30.780]  Just attach.
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:32.600]  What do you need to attach?
[01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:35.840]  Oh. Scrumptious.
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:37.620]  Extremely tasty. Delicious. I wonder
[01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:39.240]  if the root of it is
[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:40.220]  like, so, like,
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:43.400]  if it comes from, like, it's so good
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:44.740]  it tastes stolen, or something.
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:47.180]  That's what I was about to say. How I'm talking
[01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:49.300]  about that a Coke is the
[01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:50.860]  best beverage in a snow
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:53.120]  scenario. Does an
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.680]  apple that's stolen taste better?
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:57.320]  Yeah, maybe. So it'd be like
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:59.280]  if you got a lot of money
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:01.220]  that was stolen, you could be like, ooh, it feels
[01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:01.980]  thiefly.
[01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:02.040]  Thiefly.
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:07.920]  It spins
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:08.460]  thiefly.
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:11.380]  Ugh.
[01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:13.980]  Alright, well. We made a really
[01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:15.640]  long one. That was a long episode.
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:17.940]  Jesus, is it really? Oh my god, you're right.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.080]  It's an hour and twenty minutes. Oh my god!
[01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:22.060]  I gotta go get my kid! God damn it.
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:25.980]  I gotta go. He's gonna
[01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:27.900]  break another phone. This is gonna cost
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:29.140]  another phone. I hope not.
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:30.500]  Gonna go to the wrong school.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.280]  I've done that before.
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.320]  Alright, take it away, Jack!
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:41.200]  Hey guys, minor league fan Jack here
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:42.960]  with a look at next week's episode of
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:45.100]  F*** Face. It's the second episode
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:47.120]  of season three. Geoff is
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:49.100]  an Ashton Kutcher fan. Andrew
[01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:50.720]  wants a coin toss specialist.
[01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:53.000]  Gavin wants some jewelry for his cats.
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:54.940]  The boys talk about securing
[01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:57.020]  bread. And once again, Andrew
[01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:58.420]  does not eat the pencil.
[01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:00.980]  All that and more on the next episode of
[01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:01.580]  F*** Face.
