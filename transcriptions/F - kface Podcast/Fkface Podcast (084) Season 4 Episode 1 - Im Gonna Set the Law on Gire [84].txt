[00:15.060 --> 00:20.620]  Holy shit, goddamn, here we are, 2022, first episode of the year.
[00:21.360 --> 00:28.360]  F***face, we just started, Andrew. You're starting off 2022 with a bang. Can you believe it's already year 3?
[00:29.100 --> 00:31.360]  Is it? No. When does year 3 start?
[00:32.280 --> 00:35.500]  On the second anniversary of F***face.
[00:35.820 --> 00:36.100]  Yeah.
[00:36.800 --> 00:37.960]  So, episode 104?
[00:37.960 --> 00:38.660]  104?
[00:39.380 --> 00:45.760]  Can you believe it's almost year 3, but we're already 3 episodes into season 3 at this point? Man, the time flies.
[00:46.120 --> 00:48.000]  Computer freeze. Frozen.
[00:48.880 --> 00:51.060]  Is this a bit?
[00:51.240 --> 00:52.080]  Can you hear us?
[00:52.460 --> 00:54.400]  Wait, can you hear me?
[00:54.720 --> 00:56.660]  We hear you, and can you hear us?
[00:56.880 --> 01:02.020]  Oh, yeah, it's just frozen. My screen is frozen. I'm trying to print the law. My screen is frozen.
[01:02.580 --> 01:05.080]  It's just showing Geoff talking and nobody else lighting up.
[01:05.080 --> 01:09.480]  So I thought, I froze again. This is typically what happens when I disconnect during the show.
[01:11.140 --> 01:13.920]  How many pages of the law have printed out?
[01:14.200 --> 01:17.440]  I don't know. It's downstairs. I'm just assuming. I'll just check it out.
[01:17.600 --> 01:20.400]  You just send the law to a different room and it's just printing away?
[01:21.100 --> 01:25.040]  It's downstairs. I don't know what you want from me. I don't have a printer up here. Like, I can't send it.
[01:25.120 --> 01:28.560]  What am I printing it on in this room? If I keep it in this room, what am I doing, Gavin?
[01:28.800 --> 01:31.240]  Well, I don't know. You have a Keurig in there. So who knows?
[01:31.240 --> 01:36.100]  It's true. That's a fair point. I can't argue that. I don't like that I can't see who's talking and when.
[01:36.260 --> 01:37.580]  I feel like I'm constantly frozen.
[01:37.860 --> 01:40.260]  That's your fault! That's your fault!
[01:40.740 --> 01:44.220]  That's your fault. You did that. No, yes, you did that.
[01:44.560 --> 01:47.900]  First of all, I wasn't saying no to you. I agree with you. You're right, Eric.
[01:48.100 --> 01:50.960]  Oh, I'm back. We're good. Never mind. We're fine. It unfroze. We're good.
[01:52.600 --> 01:55.160]  I want to talk about a thing before I forget.
[01:55.580 --> 01:59.740]  Because we should have mentioned it last time because it's specific to the one we recorded before.
[01:59.740 --> 02:04.440]  I immediately texted Gavin this once we finished.
[02:04.660 --> 02:09.060]  I completely misunderstood the turkey sandwich story. I don't think I could see.
[02:09.660 --> 02:13.960]  I misinterpreted what was going on in that image so badly.
[02:14.860 --> 02:18.680]  So what you were laughing at was potentially funnier than what happened in my story.
[02:18.780 --> 02:26.840]  It is quite... I think you can maybe make the case that my version is funnier, but makes absolutely no sense in the logistics of how planes work.
[02:28.080 --> 02:32.020]  So where's that picture? Do we still have it? Do you misunderstand the picture?
[02:32.440 --> 02:35.560]  So I'm going to post the photo again. We're going to revisit this.
[02:35.820 --> 02:37.060]  In the chat now.
[02:38.740 --> 02:41.560]  How do you misunderstand this?
[02:41.980 --> 02:47.280]  I guess I only... Speaking of Gavin talking about his peripheral vision failing him,
[02:47.620 --> 02:51.860]  I feel as though I only used my peripheral vision to fully look at this photo.
[02:52.440 --> 02:54.380]  I only looked out...
[02:56.840 --> 02:59.460]  I only looked out your window.
[02:59.700 --> 03:02.240]  I never paid... I never really...
[03:02.240 --> 03:06.300]  I circled in a giant red circle, man!
[03:07.020 --> 03:11.420]  So this is how I interpreted the photo. And maybe with your peripheral vision, you could do the same.
[03:11.780 --> 03:15.120]  I was looking at a window, and to my right is a wall.
[03:15.340 --> 03:18.260]  You're facing a wall. That's a wall with a hole.
[03:18.260 --> 03:20.760]  Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[03:20.940 --> 03:22.060]  What? What?
[03:23.740 --> 03:28.040]  So I interpreted it as like you're sitting at the front of the plane.
[03:28.160 --> 03:30.260]  You're at the front of whatever section you're in.
[03:30.900 --> 03:32.200]  Why is Jack typing?
[03:44.740 --> 03:46.540]  We've got mice in the pantry.
[03:52.480 --> 03:54.980]  How is Jack in our Discord right now?
[03:57.800 --> 04:00.880]  We could so mess with Jack, because he's not listening.
[04:01.740 --> 04:04.760]  Yeah. We could do something like...
[04:05.380 --> 04:07.720]  Yes? Okay, and then...
[04:07.720 --> 04:09.740]  Were you waiting for one of us to have an idea?
[04:10.540 --> 04:12.800]  I've had the idea. Okay.
[04:21.080 --> 04:24.580]  I don't want to type. That's the funniest... What a fucking great idea.
[04:24.800 --> 04:25.960]  You're a goddamn genius.
[04:30.540 --> 04:33.240]  You're the funniest person I've ever met.
[04:33.600 --> 04:36.780]  That is the funniest fucking thing I have ever seen in my entire life.
[04:36.980 --> 04:38.100]  Oh my god.
[04:40.720 --> 04:42.280]  I was going to post that later,
[04:42.420 --> 04:44.880]  but the fact that Jack started typing it here was just...
[04:44.880 --> 04:46.180]  It made it the perfect time.
[04:46.280 --> 04:50.800]  Oh my god. Do you want to explain what you just posted?
[04:52.040 --> 04:53.660]  Well, it kind of came in out of order, actually,
[04:53.700 --> 04:57.220]  but I posted a picture of Jack and his car,
[04:57.360 --> 04:59.380]  then a picture of his... Who left?
[05:00.860 --> 05:01.580]  Andrew left.
[05:03.120 --> 05:05.480]  I posted a picture of Jack's car,
[05:05.480 --> 05:07.980]  then I posted a picture of Jack's car key,
[05:08.160 --> 05:10.540]  and then I put an arrow to under his car seat,
[05:10.700 --> 05:12.820]  and then I posted a picture of a bag of cocaine.
[05:15.720 --> 05:19.100]  And a big picture of Jack smiling next to the car.
[05:19.680 --> 05:21.640]  Just so Jack has to look at all these pictures
[05:21.640 --> 05:24.240]  and assume that that's somehow in this episode.
[05:29.060 --> 05:30.740]  Because I've been thinking about this,
[05:30.800 --> 05:32.200]  but didn't know the timing of it.
[05:32.200 --> 05:34.020]  Or people would be mad,
[05:34.160 --> 05:37.060]  because they like the segment so much.
[05:37.420 --> 05:39.600]  I can't take it. It's too funny.
[05:40.860 --> 05:42.260]  The sequence is great.
[05:42.520 --> 05:45.960]  You're definitely telling a narrative that Jack is smuggling cocaine
[05:45.960 --> 05:47.020]  in the back of his car.
[06:01.150 --> 06:02.610]  I'm gonna die!
[06:05.490 --> 06:06.050]  Oxygen!
[06:08.450 --> 06:10.630]  I'm sweating from laughing so hard.
[06:10.630 --> 06:12.010]  Oh my god.
[06:14.290 --> 06:17.130]  The longer Jack doesn't respond,
[06:17.670 --> 06:18.890]  the funnier it gets.
[06:19.210 --> 06:22.550]  Now I'm nervous that he's gonna be mad.
[06:26.390 --> 06:28.810]  That's what makes it so much better.
[06:30.910 --> 06:32.750]  Next week on F*** Face.
[06:33.530 --> 06:36.530]  Three pounds of cocaine are under my car seat.
[06:42.490 --> 06:44.930]  Oh man. He got a jail free card.
[06:45.030 --> 06:45.710]  He's doing your idea.
[06:47.270 --> 06:50.830]  Apologies for the very visual gag there
[06:50.830 --> 06:53.310]  to the audience, but I assume we can somehow
[06:53.310 --> 06:55.530]  make a picture out of it on Instagram.
[06:58.450 --> 06:59.690]  The turkey thing.
[07:00.930 --> 07:01.750]  I viewed that as a wall.
[07:02.630 --> 07:03.110]  You're right.
[07:05.630 --> 07:06.430]  Where's the wall?
[07:06.430 --> 07:07.970]  The window in front of you?
[07:08.310 --> 07:10.050]  I thought that was a wall.
[07:11.310 --> 07:12.250]  Not a window.
[07:12.650 --> 07:14.730]  But it's a window.
[07:15.110 --> 07:16.770]  There's shit out of it.
[07:16.930 --> 07:21.190]  I understand. This is really dumb.
[07:21.750 --> 07:24.110]  I only learned this because I was describing what had happened
[07:24.110 --> 07:25.810]  and nobody knew what I was talking about.
[07:26.070 --> 07:30.190]  I assumed I'd created in my head that because of COVID
[07:30.190 --> 07:33.750]  and wanting distancing, that if you had a wall seat
[07:33.750 --> 07:36.570]  they had a little food hole to put the food through.
[07:37.190 --> 07:38.350]  And so in my head,
[07:38.970 --> 07:41.550]  your version of the story, you're looking out that window
[07:41.550 --> 07:44.350]  and then they shoved a turkey sandwich through the food hole
[07:44.350 --> 07:45.830]  and that's what you got spooked at.
[07:46.090 --> 07:48.810]  Not that it was just a reflection in the window in front of you.
[07:50.210 --> 07:53.490]  Do you think he's in solitary confinement?
[07:54.370 --> 07:56.570]  They're shoving his food through a f***ing hole?
[07:57.090 --> 08:00.070]  I haven't been on a plane in several years at this point.
[08:00.130 --> 08:01.810]  I don't know what's going on in the sky.
[08:02.250 --> 08:05.210]  I had questions too about how this would even work.
[08:05.290 --> 08:07.930]  It didn't really make sense in my head, but that's how I interpreted it.
[08:07.930 --> 08:11.850]  Just imagining some guy getting blasted by the wind
[08:11.850 --> 08:14.510]  stood out in the wind, trying to shove turkey sandwiches
[08:15.710 --> 08:17.610]  into the first class cabin.
[08:19.150 --> 08:20.390]  Obviously it was not outside.
[08:20.650 --> 08:23.510]  I assumed it would be where the attendance would be.
[08:23.510 --> 08:26.070]  There's a wall, and there's the natural barrier.
[08:26.230 --> 08:29.190]  Sometimes there's a toilet on that wall, on the other side of it.
[08:29.330 --> 08:32.630]  And I assumed that they had a food hole for the wall
[08:32.630 --> 08:36.070]  so you didn't have to be near the person to give them their turkey sandwich.
[08:37.050 --> 08:40.950]  So what I was saying about the reflection and the optical illusion,
[08:42.110 --> 08:45.610]  I don't understand which part you thought I thought was the plane.
[08:45.790 --> 08:49.310]  Do you think I was just looking at someone's hand come through the hole
[08:49.310 --> 08:51.670]  with a turkey sandwich and that looked like a plane?
[08:53.590 --> 08:54.810]  Alright. Okay.
[08:56.090 --> 08:57.710]  I think you've stumped them.
[08:59.830 --> 09:01.530]  Today is a technical nightmare.
[09:02.110 --> 09:04.770]  I went into Achievement Hunter, nothing worked.
[09:04.870 --> 09:07.210]  I was there for two hours, filmed nothing, had to leave.
[09:07.210 --> 09:10.530]  Are you serious? To come home and film my video,
[09:10.970 --> 09:13.550]  which is now being rushed, and that broke too!
[09:13.930 --> 09:16.210]  Now this doesn't work! Do you think it's you?
[09:16.650 --> 09:18.270]  Oh yeah. Too many coincidences, right?
[09:18.270 --> 09:21.270]  I got good coin luck, but technically-wise...
[09:24.090 --> 09:29.190]  Dude, I cannot wait to see how Jack handles this.
[09:29.430 --> 09:32.030]  Gavin, that is really the funniest fucking thing to me.
[09:32.150 --> 09:34.710]  I don't know why. It's just... oh God.
[09:35.630 --> 09:37.670]  That's the best. How long have you been holding on to that?
[09:39.990 --> 09:41.510]  I came up with it last night.
[09:42.090 --> 09:44.870]  Nice. Look at you coming up with ideas. That's awesome.
[09:44.870 --> 09:46.210]  Do you think...
[09:46.210 --> 09:51.370]  The goal is to make it seem like you didn't plan a bunch of stuff, right?
[09:51.790 --> 09:52.690]  Where it's more spontaneous.
[09:53.630 --> 09:53.830]  Yeah.
[09:54.850 --> 09:56.510]  Are you giving a little peer behind the curtain?
[09:56.950 --> 09:58.510]  I write all this shit down.
[09:59.110 --> 10:02.750]  I write it all down, but the way I bring it up is often like,
[10:02.830 --> 10:05.950]  if it's near a conversation, I can just pluck from the list,
[10:06.010 --> 10:09.710]  and it seems less like I'm stopping the conversation to come up with something.
[10:10.450 --> 10:11.250]  Totally agree.
[10:12.050 --> 10:12.930]  What are you on now?
[10:12.930 --> 10:13.810]  Well...
[10:16.050 --> 10:18.990]  My computer's still frozen. I have this.
[10:19.510 --> 10:20.890]  Stop printing the lore!
[10:21.170 --> 10:23.310]  Well, okay. I've stopped...
[10:23.310 --> 10:26.030]  Okay, I've stopped. The print has stopped.
[10:26.270 --> 10:27.450]  My computer's still frozen.
[10:28.330 --> 10:31.370]  I plugged my Xbox headset into my phone.
[10:31.530 --> 10:34.890]  I'm now talking into my microphone for recording the show.
[10:35.710 --> 10:38.810]  I'm talking into two mics right now, but I can hear you through...
[10:38.810 --> 10:40.810]  I think I've unfroze.
[10:40.810 --> 10:42.330]  I think we're okay.
[10:42.770 --> 10:43.250]  Sorry.
[10:43.610 --> 10:47.970]  It sounds like you're calling me from a season one Red vs. Blue recording.
[10:49.050 --> 10:50.230]  I made that joke.
[10:50.950 --> 10:51.490]  I made that joke.
[10:52.470 --> 10:55.510]  Okay. Am I unfrozen? I'm unfrozen.
[10:55.830 --> 10:57.790]  I'm going to swap back.
[10:58.650 --> 11:01.990]  Do you think you're going to have any problems editing this,
[11:02.030 --> 11:03.790]  or do you think it's just going to be pretty straight and narrow?
[11:05.470 --> 11:06.370]  Easy peasy.
[11:08.910 --> 11:10.490]  Nick just said, dude.
[11:14.110 --> 11:16.250]  2022's off to a shit start for Nick, man.
[11:17.910 --> 11:19.690]  So, are you back, Andrew?
[11:20.470 --> 11:22.790]  I'm good. I'm back. Sorry about that. We're all good.
[11:23.490 --> 11:25.370]  Which part did you hear me ask you about?
[11:26.790 --> 11:33.890]  Oh, did you think I got scared by a guy's hand coming through a hole and not a reflection?
[11:35.830 --> 11:38.090]  Okay. I missed it. It froze again.
[11:38.310 --> 11:39.710]  Oh my God!
[11:40.230 --> 11:43.710]  What do you say? Sorry. I was going to do a bit, but it actually happened.
[11:47.790 --> 11:50.730]  I just don't care enough about the answer to ask you again.
[11:51.130 --> 12:01.350]  Did you think that I got scared by a guy's hand with a turkey sandwich in it coming through a hole instead of the reflection of that behind me?
[12:01.350 --> 12:08.310]  Exactly. I thought that you got scared by somebody shoving a turkey sandwich through a hole unexpectedly, and you just saw movement.
[12:09.990 --> 12:17.490]  I may have not described it very well. I was worried about that at the time, because without the visual, you had the picture, though!
[12:19.290 --> 12:21.350]  You described it exceptionally clearly.
[12:22.410 --> 12:28.630]  It was fine. It was just my dumb brain. I decided that was a wall, and that was facing you.
[12:28.630 --> 12:33.550]  And that that was a food hole, and that planes now have food holes, since I've gotten on flights.
[12:33.950 --> 12:35.110]  I made a lot of leaps.
[12:35.510 --> 12:38.310]  Don't you think I would have mentioned the phrase, food hole?
[12:38.810 --> 12:46.250]  Yeah, you probably would have. I wish you guys could have seen the room when I was trying to describe the food hole to the plane.
[12:46.530 --> 12:49.630]  I think I opened with, you know how planes now have the...
[12:50.790 --> 12:52.030]  Oh my god!
[12:54.770 --> 13:00.570]  The thing you... like, you did a great job. The thing you didn't account for is that Andrew doesn't understand planes.
[13:01.290 --> 13:05.570]  I don't understand planes, and I apparently don't see, because we had the same issue with the break shit thing,
[13:05.870 --> 13:10.650]  where I was like, there's nobody in the stands on that card, and then people were like, what are you talking about?
[13:10.790 --> 13:13.150]  That's a full arena. My eyes just don't work.
[13:14.030 --> 13:17.930]  Oh yeah, I had so much fun on that last break shit, the fuck stick break shit.
[13:18.090 --> 13:20.970]  I feel like that show is really coming into its own.
[13:21.950 --> 13:29.290]  One of the things that we... I was saying in the last podcast, in 2022, I want to go into sports in a big way.
[13:29.710 --> 13:35.150]  I think one of the ways I want to do that is that idea that we officially announced on the break show,
[13:35.430 --> 13:38.050]  which is that I want to create the infinity towel, right?
[13:38.050 --> 13:48.290]  You guys have long made fun of me for having a basketball card that has a swatch of Marcus Smart's game-used towel,
[13:49.130 --> 13:52.970]  and it says, tools of the trade, which you think is ridiculous that a towel could be a tool.
[13:54.070 --> 13:57.630]  And we had the idea, and it might have actually been your idea from the beginning, Andrew,
[13:58.150 --> 14:03.430]  but we had an idea to get as many different pieces of towels from as many different NBA players as possible,
[14:03.430 --> 14:08.370]  and create the most talented towel of all time, the goat of towels, the infinity towel,
[14:08.610 --> 14:15.810]  with LeBron James and Kobe Bryant and Steph Curry and Jason Tatum and Nikola Djokic and all the best players,
[14:15.970 --> 14:22.310]  and then we just sew it together and make this patchwork quilt, towel of power, as it were.
[14:22.550 --> 14:27.270]  It was an idea that ranged... I didn't know that towel cards existed.
[14:27.570 --> 14:30.730]  I didn't know that was such a dumb thing that could even possibly exist.
[14:30.730 --> 14:32.130]  I wanted to do a jersey.
[14:32.370 --> 14:33.030]  Says food hole guy.
[14:33.830 --> 14:35.630]  Well, I mean, that's... listen.
[14:36.790 --> 14:37.890]  That's my stupidity.
[14:38.030 --> 14:38.390]  What a dumb idea.
[14:38.930 --> 14:42.630]  That's my... I would never... tools of the trade towel card. That's absurd.
[14:43.650 --> 14:44.710]  Towel-linted towel.
[14:45.590 --> 14:46.250]  Nice, Nick.
[14:46.870 --> 14:47.450]  Nice, Nick.
[14:49.270 --> 14:53.250]  There are cards, too, of like... there's a whole set of Adam St. Richard...
[14:54.290 --> 14:55.970]  He's cutting out again. This sucks.
[14:56.550 --> 14:57.390]  This motherfucker.
[14:57.630 --> 14:58.250]  This blows.
[14:59.550 --> 15:01.430]  He needs to stop the print.
[15:01.690 --> 15:04.630]  He's still printing the law.
[15:05.290 --> 15:09.630]  We're bordering on not having a second episode here if we have too many more of these fucking problems.
[15:10.510 --> 15:13.970]  Nick is a tremendous editor, but he can only do so much.
[15:14.170 --> 15:16.570]  He can't invent audio that doesn't exist.
[15:17.210 --> 15:20.190]  He can't create a show out of sackcloth and ashes, unfortunately.
[15:21.510 --> 15:24.650]  Maybe he could. Maybe he could do Andrew for pickups.
[15:24.770 --> 15:25.470]  He's gone.
[15:25.710 --> 15:26.270]  Andrew's gone.
[15:26.270 --> 15:26.710]  He's gone again.
[15:27.150 --> 15:29.550]  Well, Gav, do you want to just... oh, no, he's back.
[15:30.330 --> 15:31.150]  Is he back?
[15:32.830 --> 15:35.650]  You guys, uh... when are you going out of town, Gav?
[15:37.190 --> 15:37.590]  Monday.
[15:37.870 --> 15:39.090]  Tomorrow or something? God damn it.
[15:40.890 --> 15:42.550]  Yeah, do you think his C drive's full?
[15:44.310 --> 15:49.310]  Well, yeah, because the law is a very... it's a thick document.
[15:49.310 --> 15:56.590]  So I would think that saving that, unless he just printed it from a browser, which is more insane.
[15:57.470 --> 16:02.010]  It's like all of his CPU usage is floating the law in a web browser.
[16:02.130 --> 16:05.590]  100% CPU devoted to the law.
[16:06.350 --> 16:07.470]  Google Chrome.
[16:09.590 --> 16:10.530]  Am I back?
[16:11.050 --> 16:13.390]  Oh, boy, in a big way. You're back.
[16:13.510 --> 16:14.190]  I think I'm back.
[16:14.490 --> 16:14.930]  Oh, yeah.
[16:15.490 --> 16:16.050]  Fucking...
[16:16.050 --> 16:16.930]  Is your computer full?
[16:18.570 --> 16:19.590]  Is everyone quiet?
[16:19.730 --> 16:20.610]  Oh, my God.
[16:20.850 --> 16:22.190]  I'm talking to you.
[16:22.230 --> 16:22.850]  Oh, my God.
[16:25.890 --> 16:26.330]  Andrew!
[16:27.550 --> 16:28.490]  Can you not hear me?
[16:28.590 --> 16:29.570]  Can you imagine?
[16:29.930 --> 16:30.290]  Can you hear me?
[16:30.550 --> 16:31.530]  Can you imagine?
[16:31.890 --> 16:32.910]  I genuinely can't hear you.
[16:33.290 --> 16:34.570]  I'll leave and I'll come back.
[16:34.690 --> 16:35.110]  It's 2022.
[16:36.510 --> 16:39.310]  You're like, I'm going to start the new year off right.
[16:39.390 --> 16:40.790]  I want to start fresh.
[16:41.350 --> 16:44.830]  I'm going to pick up a new podcast, maybe something that's been recommended to me.
[16:44.830 --> 16:47.450]  Or maybe I'll just search around for my relative interests.
[16:47.610 --> 16:48.550]  Oh, fuck face.
[16:48.650 --> 16:48.850]  Right.
[16:48.950 --> 16:50.250]  Yeah, I'll give this a shot.
[16:50.530 --> 16:52.590]  I might as well just start with the most recent episode.
[16:52.850 --> 16:55.590]  Just start 2022 off as they are in 2022.
[16:55.890 --> 16:58.550]  This would be the last episode you ever listen to.
[16:59.130 --> 17:02.010]  This might ruin podcasts for you as a whole.
[17:02.330 --> 17:03.110]  If you listen to this.
[17:04.550 --> 17:05.030]  Jesus.
[17:05.930 --> 17:06.290]  Andrew.
[17:09.680 --> 17:11.620]  This is really something.
[17:13.240 --> 17:14.880]  Are you just being quiet now on purpose?
[17:15.380 --> 17:15.960]  Oh, I'm back.
[17:15.960 --> 17:16.520]  Now I'm back.
[17:16.600 --> 17:17.540]  What do you mean?
[17:17.920 --> 17:18.740]  I'm so sorry.
[17:18.840 --> 17:19.780]  You're not back.
[17:20.140 --> 17:21.360]  You're cutting out, you idiot.
[17:22.240 --> 17:23.140]  What do you mean I'm cutting out?
[17:23.420 --> 17:23.840]  What do you want?
[17:23.920 --> 17:24.880]  What do you mean?
[17:25.840 --> 17:27.040]  Do you know what he means?
[17:28.100 --> 17:28.800]  No, I don't.
[17:29.680 --> 17:30.520]  Delete the law.
[17:31.120 --> 17:32.300]  Delete the law.
[17:32.600 --> 17:34.100]  I deleted the law.
[17:34.640 --> 17:37.300]  That last time I froze up, I was just going to my tab with notes.
[17:37.620 --> 17:38.580]  I was just going to my notes tab.
[17:38.640 --> 17:39.320]  Don't do anything.
[17:39.580 --> 17:40.340]  Do nothing.
[17:40.580 --> 17:41.080]  Can we...
[17:41.080 --> 17:42.440]  Okay, I'm not going to touch a thing.
[17:42.660 --> 17:43.180]  Can we just...
[17:43.180 --> 17:43.960]  Use your mouth.
[17:43.960 --> 17:44.380]  Can we move on?
[17:44.480 --> 17:45.000]  No hands.
[17:45.120 --> 17:46.100]  Can we go to the next season?
[17:46.260 --> 17:47.740]  Can we just change seasons at this point?
[17:47.820 --> 17:49.260]  I feel like the season's already lost.
[17:49.380 --> 17:52.260]  Can we move to whatever season three, season four, whatever we're on?
[17:52.640 --> 17:53.640]  I think we got to change seasons.
[17:53.680 --> 17:54.080]  I mean...
[17:54.080 --> 17:54.480]  I'm so sorry.
[17:54.780 --> 17:55.020]  Yeah.
[17:55.320 --> 17:56.460]  Yeah, we can...
[17:56.460 --> 17:57.060]  We can...
[17:57.060 --> 17:58.520]  This could be the last episode of season three.
[17:58.520 --> 17:59.180]  Let's swap seasons.
[17:59.720 --> 17:59.900]  Yeah.
[18:00.240 --> 18:04.360]  Season three was horrendous, but don't move in this episode.
[18:04.500 --> 18:05.340]  It has to be next episode.
[18:05.440 --> 18:06.220]  We need a clean break.
[18:06.380 --> 18:08.460]  Yeah, we can't do a mid-episode season switch.
[18:08.880 --> 18:12.220]  Has that ever happened on an episode where it became the next season?
[18:13.260 --> 18:14.060]  Midway through.
[18:14.540 --> 18:15.060]  Alright.
[18:15.320 --> 18:18.820]  Well, now we've got to do it because it's ground-breaking.
[18:19.120 --> 18:21.660]  Because we're doing shit that nobody's ever thought of before.
[18:26.420 --> 18:31.100]  And that's the moment season three, year two of F*** Face ended.
[18:31.500 --> 18:35.800]  Congratulations, you've made it all the way to season four, year two of F*** Face.
[18:36.080 --> 18:38.980]  Episode one, season four, year two of F*** Face.
[18:39.300 --> 18:43.840]  Overall, episode 84 and a half, I guess, at this point, is where we are.
[18:43.840 --> 18:44.280]  Maybe.
[18:44.920 --> 18:45.280]  Yeah.
[18:46.340 --> 18:54.020]  We may be tainting season four as well, but I think it was worth doing just to be a mid-episode switch of seasons.
[18:54.160 --> 18:56.020]  I feel bad for season three.
[18:56.120 --> 19:03.220]  I feel like season three had a lot of opportunity, had a lot of good momentum, and then it just got bogged down with technical problems.
[19:03.480 --> 19:06.920]  That it's going to make it look, in the grand scheme of things, it's going to be overlooked as a season.
[19:07.140 --> 19:11.040]  But for what it was, two and a half episodes or whatever, I think it was really strong.
[19:13.840 --> 19:15.860]  It was like a season of Luther or something short.
[19:16.140 --> 19:21.080]  We could probably submit the entire season to an award show or something, like best season, because it was strong.
[19:21.180 --> 19:21.880]  It was very brief.
[19:22.320 --> 19:23.920]  Yeah, strong and brief. Yeah.
[19:24.560 --> 19:25.360]  It was very British.
[19:25.540 --> 19:30.400]  It's a great point, because they always submit just one or two episodes from a show, those award things.
[19:30.480 --> 19:34.660]  We could genuinely do the entire season. Season three is fully up for nomination.
[19:35.220 --> 19:40.500]  I will say, since we started season four, your audio has been phenomenal, Andrew.
[19:40.820 --> 19:41.040]  Yeah.
[19:41.800 --> 19:42.680]  That's what I said.
[19:43.420 --> 19:44.700]  God damn it!
[19:45.060 --> 19:46.340]  Oh, are you serious?
[19:46.460 --> 19:46.840]  God damn it!
[19:53.500 --> 19:55.620]  He must be messing with us.
[19:55.760 --> 19:59.340]  You can't ruin season four, too! You killed season three!
[19:59.820 --> 20:03.800]  You can't kill season four in the wo- it's in the cradle still!
[20:04.080 --> 20:06.380]  It hasn't even taken it's first breath yet!
[20:06.720 --> 20:09.000]  It's eyes aren't open, you can't kill it now!
[20:10.160 --> 20:14.520]  We might have to go back to season three. I don't know, this is insane.
[20:14.720 --> 20:15.960]  You can't do that.
[20:15.960 --> 20:22.680]  I mean, it's like, I just don't think that season four ever got off it's feet, and now look at where we are.
[20:22.800 --> 20:24.100]  Like, this is...
[20:25.880 --> 20:28.440]  This is like a season three post-mortem!
[20:28.720 --> 20:34.140]  We might just have to put a bullet in season four and start over again with season five, holy shit!
[20:34.720 --> 20:37.340]  No. No, we can rescue season four.
[20:37.440 --> 20:38.280]  I'm so sorry!
[20:38.820 --> 20:40.180]  What are you doing?!
[20:40.180 --> 20:44.920]  I wasn't doing anything! I was just sitting at a screen and everything froze!
[20:44.920 --> 20:46.820]  My computer sucked!
[20:47.420 --> 20:50.220]  I stopped printing the wall like an hour ago!
[20:51.400 --> 20:53.720]  I'm wearing two sets of headphones!
[20:54.400 --> 20:56.240]  I don't know, I don't know!
[20:56.600 --> 20:57.840]  I don't know what to do!
[20:59.200 --> 21:02.160]  I'm talking into two microphones right now!
[21:02.520 --> 21:04.460]  What do you want from me? I'm trying!
[21:05.540 --> 21:06.560]  Legible audio!
[21:06.980 --> 21:08.360]  Something- this is Andrew!
[21:08.360 --> 21:10.060]  I don't know what to do!
[21:10.060 --> 21:11.600]  I don't know what you want!
[21:11.820 --> 21:13.620]  I'm talking into two microphones right now!
[21:13.940 --> 21:16.600]  I can't believe it!
[21:16.600 --> 21:17.620]  I can't believe it!
[21:18.520 --> 21:20.340]  This is getting fantastic!
[21:24.740 --> 21:29.140]  I can unplug, but then there's going to be double audio, and so I can...
[21:29.140 --> 21:32.020]  Don't unplug! Don't unplug! Don't unplug anything!
[21:32.520 --> 21:37.340]  His original file is still running and recording his original mic.
[21:37.340 --> 21:41.160]  Gavin, zero. I don't know what Nick is going to do.
[21:41.740 --> 21:43.160]  Here we go. What do you mean?
[21:43.900 --> 21:45.200]  Look at this!
[21:46.020 --> 21:49.960]  It's the same mic, I just put the headphone out and I'm talking into it like a phone.
[21:50.080 --> 21:52.520]  It's the same, it's the phone, but I removed my Xbox mic.
[21:52.740 --> 21:53.540]  It sounds so much better.
[21:53.860 --> 21:54.680]  Yeah, this is good?
[21:54.920 --> 21:58.340]  No, it's not good. It is not good. It is not good, but it sounds better.
[21:59.180 --> 21:59.500]  Okay.
[22:01.620 --> 22:03.220]  This might have to be the final episode.
[22:04.220 --> 22:05.680]  This might be where this all ends.
[22:06.740 --> 22:11.600]  No, because I have plans for 2022. I want to talk about an idea I had.
[22:15.020 --> 22:16.620]  I just, I really...
[22:17.320 --> 22:21.920]  Andrew, do you want to... I want to end on my idea, so Andrew, do you want to cover what you wanted to talk about?
[22:22.660 --> 22:26.120]  No, it's go ahead. You talk about your idea. I'll be here, I'll just be quietly listening.
[22:26.480 --> 22:26.800]  Alright.
[22:27.080 --> 22:27.240]  I'll support you.
[22:27.660 --> 22:31.140]  Well, here's the deal. 2022, new year, fresh start, right?
[22:31.140 --> 22:39.340]  We just started season 4. We put season 3 to bed a little earlier than I anticipated by about 50 episodes.
[22:39.940 --> 22:46.880]  But whatever. I have no interest in looking in the rear view mirror. Let's move forward. Always marching forward. That's what we do, right?
[22:47.480 --> 22:49.600]  We're going to advance towards future victory.
[22:50.340 --> 22:53.380]  So, season 3 was forcibly put down, Nick said. Yeah.
[22:53.760 --> 22:58.320]  Jesus Christ, it's like Old Yeller. We took it around the back behind the barn and put a tube between the eyes.
[22:58.320 --> 22:59.620]  Fucking hell.
[23:00.200 --> 23:01.680]  It had rabies, yeah.
[23:01.780 --> 23:02.980]  It had rabies.
[23:03.660 --> 23:05.900]  We had to cut its head off just to make sure.
[23:06.620 --> 23:09.080]  Otherwise, Billy's going to get a series of shots.
[23:09.680 --> 23:10.840]  We got close.
[23:12.940 --> 23:26.160]  Hey, thank you so much for listening to F*** Face, an extremely chaotic episode. I apologize.
[23:27.220 --> 23:31.500]  I would not recommend attempting to download and print the law while recording a show.
[23:31.500 --> 23:34.620]  I would, however, recommend using ExpressVPN.
[23:35.340 --> 23:41.240]  Because using the internet without ExpressVPN is like leaving your laptop exposed at the coffee shop table while you run to the bathroom.
[23:41.760 --> 23:45.680]  Most of the time you're probably fine, but what if one day you come out of the bathroom and your laptop's gone?
[23:46.540 --> 23:52.660]  I think everyone could use a VPN because every time you connect to an unencrypted network, cafes, hotels, airports,
[23:53.060 --> 23:56.460]  any hacker on the same network can gain access to your personal data.
[23:56.460 --> 24:02.340]  Whether that be passwords, financial details, really any information that is personal to you that you wouldn't want shared.
[24:02.860 --> 24:07.940]  It also doesn't really take much knowledge to know how to hack someone. I mean, a kid could do it if they wanted to.
[24:08.660 --> 24:13.260]  Your data is valuable. Hackers can make up to $1,000 per person selling personal info on the dark web.
[24:13.680 --> 24:17.260]  There's clearly incentive to do so. There's a clear motivation.
[24:18.380 --> 24:24.540]  And I think it's just important to use, or why I would use ExpressVPN is the fact that they offer an encrypted tunnel,
[24:24.540 --> 24:28.260]  which creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet.
[24:28.840 --> 24:31.840]  Hackers can't steal your sensitive data. It's super secure.
[24:32.040 --> 24:36.320]  It'd take a hacker with a supercomputer over a billion years to get past ExpressVPN's encryption.
[24:36.880 --> 24:40.580]  It's easy to use. You just fire up the app and click one button to get protected.
[24:41.220 --> 24:47.520]  Works on all devices, whether it be phones, laptops, tablets, and more, so you can stay secure on the go.
[24:47.520 --> 24:53.840]  What I really like about ExpressVPN is that it's so easy to use, as well as it just gives a level of comfort.
[24:54.660 --> 24:59.500]  I'm not doing a lot of traveling right now, but just in general, it's a great thing to have, even if you're not.
[24:59.980 --> 25:04.780]  As I said, the ease of use is awesome, and it's just... I'm somebody who can worry about anything,
[25:05.300 --> 25:10.900]  so just not having to think about that or worry about my data or my personal information is awesome.

[25:33.280 --> 25:36.180]  The new year is a great time to focus on what's most important to you.
[25:36.280 --> 25:39.920]  Whether it's saving money by ordering less takeout, which is something I'm personally trying to do.

[26:26.000 --> 26:30.220]  They're relatively quick to make, I think most of them are like 20 to 30 minutes in my experience.
[26:30.220 --> 26:38.560]  They're consistently great, and it's just such a fun and unique way to kind of expand your palette to try new things,
[26:38.700 --> 26:43.820]  as well as just being able to keep the recipes, so if you want to you can make them later down the road.
[26:44.020 --> 26:48.820]  They're great recipes, it's such an easy way to approach cooking if you're just starting,
[26:49.100 --> 26:51.540]  and the entire experience I just think is so much fun.

[27:09.100 --> 27:11.340]  So, we've done really well for ourselves.
[27:11.500 --> 27:19.640]  We created an unsearchable, unsellable, unnameable podcast about less than nothing,
[27:19.980 --> 27:23.960]  and we've achieved an incredible amount of success in that endeavor,
[27:23.960 --> 27:27.700]  and I'm floored by it. It's a testament to how talented you all are.
[27:28.060 --> 27:33.520]  It's a testament to how supportive the comment leavers and the regulation listeners are.
[27:34.120 --> 27:38.640]  But I feel like we've hit a plateau, and I want to figure out how to break into that next echelon,
[27:38.720 --> 27:41.180]  to keep growing, to keep innovating and getting better,
[27:41.220 --> 27:44.800]  because we're changing the world here, right, through this podcast.
[27:45.380 --> 27:49.900]  And so I was thinking, like, what can we do, what can we take on that's bigger,
[27:49.900 --> 27:57.360]  that maybe is more momentous, that could have some sort of an effect that improves the state of things in some way?
[27:57.580 --> 28:02.660]  And then it hit me. We, and I was also looking at what's popular on other podcasts and stuff,
[28:03.340 --> 28:07.820]  I think, f***face, in 2022, we need to solve a murder.
[28:10.760 --> 28:13.000]  That's what all the true crime podcasts are doing.
[28:13.200 --> 28:14.700]  They're all out there solving murders.
[28:15.100 --> 28:19.020]  Why don't we find and solve a crime or a murder?
[28:19.020 --> 28:22.660]  We can do it, right? We've got the regulation listeners.
[28:22.960 --> 28:25.640]  Andrew's got a spreadsheet of multi-talented people.
[28:26.100 --> 28:28.660]  We're relatively smart. We've got reach and influence.
[28:28.980 --> 28:32.180]  Why don't we solve a crime, a mystery, and then we'll...
[28:33.100 --> 28:37.940]  It just got me imagining, what if there's another podcast out there trying to solve the child kicker problem?
[28:42.140 --> 28:45.420]  Geoff, did you accidentally eat pastrami?
[28:47.300 --> 28:48.460]  Now we've lost Geoff.
[28:48.460 --> 28:50.840]  I think we may have found the murder.
[28:50.860 --> 28:54.440]  What is going on? What is the murder, Geoff?
[28:54.840 --> 28:55.600]  Did the dog kill him?
[28:55.600 --> 28:56.920]  I think the murder might be Geoff.
[28:57.040 --> 29:00.840]  Was that his bit where he's like, oh my god, he's the victim?
[29:01.200 --> 29:03.300]  He's forcing us to solve his murder.
[29:03.440 --> 29:07.620]  No, I'm not gonna fall for this Clue dinner party bullshit.
[29:07.940 --> 29:09.780]  He is not, he is fine.
[29:10.340 --> 29:11.380]  This is a game.
[29:11.740 --> 29:12.480]  No, you're talking about me?
[29:12.480 --> 29:19.300]  No, what happened was I was taking a drink of Diet Dr. Pepper right when Gavin made that joke about the Vancouver child kicker.
[29:19.800 --> 29:21.540]  And I threw up in my mouth.
[29:23.180 --> 29:26.740]  I laughed so hard and I shot Dr. Pepper into my eyeball.
[29:26.960 --> 29:28.980]  And I had to run to the bathroom to dry off.
[29:29.120 --> 29:34.520]  Because I shot out like a half of Dr. Pepper all over the mic, all over my phone, my pants.
[29:34.720 --> 29:36.300]  And it was immediate.
[29:36.680 --> 29:39.860]  We thought you were doing a bit where it's like, guys, we should solve a murder.
[29:39.980 --> 29:41.440]  Oh no, someone with a knife!
[29:43.080 --> 29:45.600]  No, no, but your wit was very sharp.
[29:45.720 --> 29:46.480]  I will say that.
[29:49.340 --> 29:50.220]  This is eventful.
[29:50.820 --> 29:53.660]  Yeah, this is something. Unhinged is a great way to put it, Eric.
[29:54.280 --> 29:59.820]  So anyway, if the audience is aware of any murders that need solving, let us know, we'll look into it.
[30:00.140 --> 30:02.220]  No, don't send us any murders.
[30:02.780 --> 30:05.100]  We don't need any murder information.
[30:05.760 --> 30:08.260]  Keep that to yourself or contact the authorities.
[30:08.580 --> 30:10.180]  We don't need to get involved in murders.
[30:10.180 --> 30:11.920]  We've got an army of murder finders.
[30:12.720 --> 30:16.800]  Yeah, well, I mean, we want a cold case, right? We want like a BTK type thing.
[30:16.900 --> 30:20.280]  We don't want to... I'm not looking... It has to be well established.
[30:20.500 --> 30:20.920]  We want vintage.
[30:21.280 --> 30:22.040]  Something that is known.
[30:22.220 --> 30:23.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[30:23.760 --> 30:25.080]  We'll do vintage murders only.
[30:25.340 --> 30:28.060]  What if we finally solve the Zodiac Killer?
[30:28.320 --> 30:31.200]  Wouldn't that be cool for our podcast? What a feather in our cap.
[30:31.600 --> 30:35.140]  Didn't they just do that? I feel like that's the bad example. I thought they just solved that.
[30:35.820 --> 30:37.180]  Yeah, but what if it was us?
[30:37.440 --> 30:39.180]  What if it was us? That's what I'm saying.
[30:39.900 --> 30:41.000]  That's a fair point.
[30:41.240 --> 30:46.460]  What if we were fucking... What's his name's wife? Rest her soul.
[30:46.580 --> 30:47.280]  Oh, Patton Oswalt?
[30:47.600 --> 30:48.300]  Patton Oswalt, yeah.
[30:48.640 --> 30:48.840]  Yeah.
[30:49.940 --> 30:51.580]  Only murders in the dark. Is that what that was called?
[30:51.760 --> 30:52.500]  I don't know. It was fucking phenomenal.
[30:52.560 --> 30:53.660]  It was something like that, yeah.
[30:54.060 --> 30:54.140]  Yeah.
[30:55.080 --> 30:58.380]  It sounds to me like I need to start printing the law again, is what you're saying.
[30:58.600 --> 31:02.180]  I need to get back into it, get to the fine details. I could be a details guy for this law thing.
[31:02.260 --> 31:06.040]  Let me start back up. I only got like, I don't know, 700 more pages to go.
[31:06.040 --> 31:10.380]  Let's wait until after the podcast and then maybe you can print the law, I guess.
[31:10.620 --> 31:13.580]  As long as I get to print the law at some point, I'm okay with it.
[31:13.600 --> 31:18.260]  I don't know what you guys want to do in 2022, but I wouldn't be opposed.
[31:18.560 --> 31:21.220]  I wouldn't be opposed to becoming sleuths.
[31:22.700 --> 31:26.760]  If we solved the mystery of some kind, it would not be shocking to me.
[31:27.620 --> 31:28.220]  That seems fine.
[31:29.160 --> 31:33.620]  When you press print on the law, how many pages does it say it was going to do?
[31:34.220 --> 31:35.620]  I just clicked...
[31:37.780 --> 31:39.600]  You gotta be kidding me.
[31:39.640 --> 31:40.080]  Did he go again?
[31:40.440 --> 31:42.220]  Was he doing it in real time?
[31:43.140 --> 31:44.200]  Did he click print?
[31:45.000 --> 31:47.260]  Did he click print on the law again?
[31:48.180 --> 31:50.880]  He was like, well, I did this, then I did this.
[31:52.940 --> 31:56.540]  I'll tell you one thing, if we might have to solve...
[31:56.540 --> 32:01.840]  If this happens a couple more times in this episode, somebody might have to solve the murder of Andrew Payton.
[32:05.040 --> 32:10.160]  We can't even solve why his stuff doesn't work, and you want to solve murders.
[32:10.680 --> 32:12.140]  This is something.
[32:12.640 --> 32:19.580]  I'm looking at the time on our recording, but I'm also looking at the separate clock in my head of how much real content we have.
[32:20.540 --> 32:21.980]  Oh, we're four minutes into this episode.
[32:22.540 --> 32:26.080]  We got seven okay minutes right now.
[32:26.300 --> 32:28.700]  No, I think we got like 18 decent minutes.
[32:28.920 --> 32:30.180]  I'd say at least 19.
[32:30.180 --> 32:33.360]  I'd argue a strong 19 at a minimum.
[32:34.060 --> 32:37.200]  Did you repeat your question, Gavin? I missed it, it froze on the middle.
[32:37.680 --> 32:39.100]  You're asking page count?
[32:39.320 --> 32:40.940]  How many pages was the law?
[32:41.440 --> 32:45.360]  I was wondering if you could climb the law.
[32:45.600 --> 32:49.480]  Like if you couldn't reach a light bulb, but the law was thick enough to climb to change it.
[32:49.700 --> 32:52.340]  Could you make the law useful in other ways?
[32:52.740 --> 32:54.940]  That's a great question, how tall I would be with the law.
[32:54.960 --> 32:55.780]  How tall is the law?
[32:57.080 --> 33:00.120]  It's like the only thing I need to be in the NBA, the law.
[33:00.400 --> 33:06.060]  If I could just stand on the law, would I then become like a genuinely decent center in the NBA?
[33:06.500 --> 33:11.780]  In addition, if you burned the law in a fireplace in 8K, could you burn it for eight hours?
[33:11.980 --> 33:13.660]  And if so, would people watch it?
[33:18.600 --> 33:21.540]  This podcast feels like we had it in one piece at the beginning.
[33:21.720 --> 33:27.780]  It smashed and we're all four of us on our hands and knees, like turning over pieces of it, like reading off it.
[33:27.780 --> 33:28.800]  You know what it's like?
[33:29.280 --> 33:29.400]  Yeah.
[33:29.800 --> 33:36.660]  It's like that Japanese art where they like smash a bowl and then they put it back together and then they outline the breaks in gold, right?
[33:36.760 --> 33:41.040]  And then it's supposed to show like new beauty and the preservation and the reconstruction of it.
[33:41.160 --> 33:44.580]  We're doing that, but we're all out of gold, so we're using feces.
[33:45.100 --> 33:52.000]  Can we upload this podcast, but change the logo for this one episode to a smashed window with the face logo?
[33:52.560 --> 33:53.600]  I think we have to.
[33:55.840 --> 33:57.040]  Oh, my God.
[33:57.500 --> 34:01.420]  Well, that was that was my my clip for for 2022.
[34:01.760 --> 34:03.140]  I want to I want to solve the crime.
[34:04.100 --> 34:06.000]  Andrew, what do you want to do in 2022?
[34:06.500 --> 34:09.060]  Other than buy a fucking computer that works?
[34:09.720 --> 34:10.780]  Well, let me go to my notes.
[34:10.880 --> 34:11.640]  I got to load my notes.
[34:11.800 --> 34:12.520]  Don't do it.
[34:12.740 --> 34:13.480]  Oh, no.
[34:13.660 --> 34:15.100]  Well, I'm already frozen on my phone.
[34:15.180 --> 34:15.520]  It's fine.
[34:15.700 --> 34:17.540]  OK, let's see.
[34:17.620 --> 34:20.700]  We may have covered the Home Alone.
[34:21.480 --> 34:23.080]  I want to talk about Home Alone with you, Geoff.
[34:23.080 --> 34:24.120]  You recommended Home Alone.
[34:24.600 --> 34:24.980]  Home Alone.
[34:25.180 --> 34:25.420]  The new one.
[34:25.620 --> 34:27.340]  I recommended Home Sweet Home Alone.
[34:27.520 --> 34:29.060]  The Ellie Kemper, Rob Delaney one.
[34:29.560 --> 34:30.280]  Home Sweet Home Alone.
[34:30.540 --> 34:30.740]  Yes.
[34:31.100 --> 34:32.140]  You recommended it.
[34:32.500 --> 34:33.460]  Watched it last night.
[34:33.640 --> 34:36.120]  It was it was not terrible, but I don't.
[34:36.260 --> 34:37.580]  Why would you recommend that movie?
[34:37.980 --> 34:39.040]  I thought it was cute and OK.
[34:39.320 --> 34:40.240]  No, it was.
[34:40.600 --> 34:42.220]  There are so many.
[34:42.460 --> 34:45.320]  I like the MCU, the involvements of the MCU.
[34:45.560 --> 34:46.200]  I like that.
[34:46.200 --> 34:48.300]  I thought that was a great, a great way to bring that in.
[34:48.480 --> 34:49.760]  I told you it makes total sense.
[34:50.060 --> 34:52.940]  And it feels like you get it and you go, that's enough.
[34:52.940 --> 34:54.280]  I appreciate it.
[34:54.360 --> 34:56.340]  The fact that the fact that you find out spoiler.
[34:56.780 --> 35:00.060]  So if you if you don't want to get spoilers from an OK movie, don't listen to this part.
[35:00.140 --> 35:04.860]  But the fact that Kevin McAllister is still fucking with his brother after all these years is really fucking funny.
[35:05.280 --> 35:05.960]  I enjoyed that.
[35:06.000 --> 35:10.380]  And I like the idea that Kevin McAllister created like a home alarm empire.
[35:10.700 --> 35:11.960]  That he's like the home alarm guy.
[35:12.060 --> 35:12.660]  That he has a system.
[35:12.960 --> 35:14.660]  I just didn't know who to root for.
[35:14.940 --> 35:17.200]  You root for Rob Delaney and Ellie Kemper.
[35:17.380 --> 35:17.860]  Not the kid.
[35:17.900 --> 35:18.540]  The kid's obnoxious.
[35:18.560 --> 35:19.260]  You don't care about the kid.
[35:19.500 --> 35:20.800]  You root for the criminals in this one.
[35:20.800 --> 35:23.020]  That's that's what makes this one different.
[35:23.320 --> 35:25.840]  But I feel like is that the criminals are the main characters.
[35:25.840 --> 35:27.580]  And the sympathetic characters.
[35:28.080 --> 35:31.580]  But it still has all of the horrendous traps and stuff in it.
[35:31.600 --> 35:35.220]  That is supposed to be the fun of the final last act.
[35:35.600 --> 35:36.560]  Yeah, I don't care who gets hurt.
[35:36.600 --> 35:37.700]  I just want to see people get hurt.
[35:38.060 --> 35:39.240]  I just felt confused.
[35:39.340 --> 35:39.820]  I didn't know.
[35:39.920 --> 35:40.900]  I didn't know who to cheer for.
[35:40.960 --> 35:42.240]  I felt like it took away from the traps.
[35:42.320 --> 35:43.960]  I didn't want them to get hurt.
[35:44.020 --> 35:45.620]  Where as opposed to the first film.
[35:45.960 --> 35:47.720]  There's such great dumb villains.
[35:47.760 --> 35:49.840]  That it's just every time something horrible happens.
[35:49.840 --> 35:50.800]  You can cheer for it.
[35:51.120 --> 35:52.480]  It felt very tonally weird.
[35:52.620 --> 35:56.820]  Did Kevin McCallister's parents ever find out what happened to him while he was home alone?
[35:57.340 --> 35:58.200]  That's a great question.
[35:58.280 --> 36:01.440]  I think if they had, the second movie couldn't have happened.
[36:01.780 --> 36:02.100]  Right?
[36:02.480 --> 36:03.680]  Why would he keep that from them?
[36:03.880 --> 36:04.480]  I don't know.
[36:04.620 --> 36:06.080]  But why would the police not tell them?
[36:06.160 --> 36:08.380]  Why would they ever let him leave their sight again?
[36:08.800 --> 36:10.120]  I mean, he almost died.
[36:10.340 --> 36:10.940]  A bunch.
[36:11.060 --> 36:11.940]  They were going to kill him.
[36:12.220 --> 36:15.160]  He also cleaned up all the mess except for the gold tooth.
[36:15.360 --> 36:16.100]  Yeah, that's true.
[36:16.480 --> 36:17.660]  How did that not get swept up?
[36:17.920 --> 36:18.080]  Yeah.
[36:18.520 --> 36:19.480]  Eric's leaving now.
[36:19.480 --> 36:21.280]  At least he's letting us know ahead of time.
[36:21.280 --> 36:22.680]  I'm just stepping away for a second.
[36:22.780 --> 36:23.320]  I'll be right back.
[36:23.560 --> 36:24.260]  Nick, cut this out.
[36:24.300 --> 36:24.920]  Nick, leave it in.
[36:25.000 --> 36:25.840]  Can we have a...
[36:28.240 --> 36:28.600]  What?
[36:29.840 --> 36:33.960]  Can we have a podcast where every single cast member doesn't leave at one point?
[36:34.620 --> 36:37.660]  Well, can you not be so funny you make me throw up on myself?
[36:38.980 --> 36:41.300]  I just have to... I finished a cup of coffee.
[36:41.400 --> 36:42.480]  I have to piss and I'm just...
[36:42.480 --> 36:44.720]  You guys are talking about Home Alone 6 or whatever.
[36:44.820 --> 36:45.420]  I'll be right back.
[36:45.660 --> 36:47.940]  You don't say anything 90% of the time.
[36:47.980 --> 36:49.020]  Why would you even bother telling us?
[36:49.020 --> 36:50.000]  I tell Nick.
[36:50.140 --> 36:52.360]  I let Nick know and I figured this was easier.
[36:52.500 --> 36:54.340]  I always let Nick know when I'm stepping away.
[36:54.440 --> 36:56.880]  Next time I'll just let Nick know and I won't let you know.
[36:58.460 --> 37:00.780]  Nick, do you need to take a break at any point?
[37:01.980 --> 37:04.200]  Well, he's typing.
[37:08.980 --> 37:10.980]  Nick says you picked a hell of a time to do that and I'm good.
[37:11.280 --> 37:14.380]  I will say one thing that kind of annoys me about this Home Alone thing.
[37:14.460 --> 37:15.620]  I get that it's not a great movie.
[37:15.720 --> 37:16.640]  I just said I enjoyed it.
[37:16.680 --> 37:17.360]  I thought it was cute.
[37:17.360 --> 37:20.840]  I enjoyed getting a piece of that world again.
[37:21.100 --> 37:25.920]  I think the thing that's funny is all this shit that you and people are talking about me on Twitter.
[37:26.120 --> 37:28.320]  When it's very clear to me they haven't seen the movie.
[37:28.420 --> 37:31.060]  They think they're talking about Home Alone 3 and they're not.
[37:31.420 --> 37:33.100]  Like I had some kid go the other day.
[37:33.260 --> 37:36.740]  Some kid was like, yeah, I've known that movie sucks since I was 12.
[37:36.900 --> 37:39.540]  And I'm like, the movie came out like November 15th.
[37:40.640 --> 37:43.980]  You cannot rule out that they've turned 13, Geoff.
[37:44.380 --> 37:45.380]  You can't rule it out.
[37:46.240 --> 37:49.560]  But it's become very clear to me that people don't know what movie we're talking about.
[37:49.940 --> 37:50.620]  I get it.
[37:50.620 --> 37:51.200]  I looked it up.
[37:51.280 --> 37:53.280]  It's got a 13 on Rotten Tomatoes.
[37:53.480 --> 37:58.680]  Like it's not well reviewed, but I don't think it's nearly as bad as the heat that it's getting.
[37:58.680 --> 37:59.520]  Is it Home Alone 5?
[37:59.720 --> 38:01.440]  Is it technically the fifth or the sixth one?
[38:02.020 --> 38:03.260]  It's either five or six.
[38:03.440 --> 38:04.520]  They definitely made four.
[38:04.780 --> 38:05.760]  I think it's five or six.
[38:06.140 --> 38:06.340]  Okay.
[38:06.800 --> 38:10.680]  I remember three being like not as good, but watchable at least.
[38:10.780 --> 38:11.680]  Yeah, three wasn't great.
[38:11.680 --> 38:12.000]  Yeah.
[38:12.360 --> 38:16.340]  It was an interesting experience to watch because I started it and then I tweeted,
[38:16.740 --> 38:17.800]  Are you fucking with me, Geoff?
[38:17.840 --> 38:19.340]  Or something along the lines, To Geoff.
[38:19.580 --> 38:20.880]  It starts horribly.
[38:21.380 --> 38:23.380]  It's a really shitty beginning to a movie.
[38:23.660 --> 38:27.600]  And then by about like the halfway point, I almost wanted to tweet an apology.
[38:27.860 --> 38:30.600]  Because it's not good, but it's not the worst.
[38:31.220 --> 38:34.440]  And I could see myself being nine and really enjoying this movie.
[38:34.440 --> 38:34.680]  Yeah.
[38:34.680 --> 38:36.100]  And then the last act happened.
[38:36.240 --> 38:37.420]  And the last act was terrible.
[38:37.760 --> 38:38.940]  I hated the last act as well.
[38:38.940 --> 38:41.420]  Not the worst thing ever, but it just I would never.
[38:41.640 --> 38:42.640]  It's a weird recommendation.
[38:43.100 --> 38:44.300]  I thought it was a good holiday movie.
[38:44.760 --> 38:45.660]  I'm glad I recommended it.
[38:45.680 --> 38:45.960]  That's fair.
[38:46.720 --> 38:47.140]  That's fair.
[38:47.260 --> 38:48.940]  I mean, what about it's weird.
[38:49.040 --> 38:53.380]  There's some SNL cameos in it that are very strange that I don't understand why.
[38:53.640 --> 38:57.720]  Like they're not big enough names to have a reaction to and they're only in it once.
[38:57.860 --> 38:59.700]  Well, do you want to know why?
[38:59.880 --> 39:02.980]  I think it was written by Mikey Day from SNL.
[39:03.340 --> 39:04.100]  Oh, okay.
[39:04.160 --> 39:06.820]  I think it was co-written by him if I'm correct.
[39:06.820 --> 39:10.760]  So it's from SNL alum in some way.
[39:10.820 --> 39:12.720]  So I think I think that's the connection there.
[39:12.820 --> 39:15.460]  Oh, there's fucking Dr. Pepper on my keyboard.
[39:19.730 --> 39:24.010]  Dr. Pepper on my keyboard was my biggest computer problem at the moment.
[39:24.250 --> 39:25.270]  I would take that.
[39:25.450 --> 39:26.790]  I feel like it's your doing though.
[39:27.050 --> 39:27.610]  I don't.
[39:27.850 --> 39:28.250]  I don't.
[39:28.570 --> 39:33.690]  Even interestingly, so Mikey Day and Streeter from College Humor wrote that movie.
[39:33.850 --> 39:36.850]  Oh, I used to love those prank wars.
[39:37.090 --> 39:38.190]  Prank wars videos.
[39:38.190 --> 39:39.250]  Yeah, those are fun.
[39:40.170 --> 39:42.390]  Some of them were brutal, like the skydiving one.
[39:42.690 --> 39:43.630]  Jesus Christ.
[39:43.870 --> 39:44.290]  Oh God.
[39:44.470 --> 39:47.510]  Or the proposal at Yankee Stadium.
[39:50.550 --> 39:51.470]  They got real.
[39:52.270 --> 39:53.390]  They escalated fast.
[39:53.490 --> 39:54.250]  That was a great series.
[39:54.370 --> 40:03.890]  If you're not familiar with like, I guess early to mid 2000s college humor videos, they had a series called Prank Wars where this dude Streeter, who was like trying to be a stand-up comedian.
[40:04.070 --> 40:06.970]  And then this dude Amir, who you might remember from Jake and Amir.
[40:07.670 --> 40:09.730]  They would do these escalating prank wars.
[40:09.790 --> 40:19.730]  And there was one where Amir paid to get a wedding proposal on Yankee Stadium from Streeter to his girlfriend and didn't tell them.
[40:19.910 --> 40:26.010]  And then he gave Streeter and his girlfriend free tickets to the game and then secretly recorded it when it popped up like in the seventh inning.
[40:26.150 --> 40:30.290]  And his girlfriend thought he was really proposing and all the cameras and everybody looked at them.
[40:30.430 --> 40:32.670]  And he had to be like, no, I'm not.
[40:32.690 --> 40:34.450]  And it was fucking brutal.
[40:34.610 --> 40:35.210]  It was a great series.
[40:35.210 --> 40:36.570]  Yeah. I don't know.
[40:36.670 --> 40:40.430]  I feel like it's tough to like when the punchline of the prank is you think you're going to die.
[40:40.970 --> 40:43.390]  That's a tough prank.
[40:43.510 --> 40:44.270]  What are you waiting?
[40:48.550 --> 40:49.630]  I should re-watch this.
[40:49.970 --> 40:50.770]  Oh, they were so good.
[40:50.950 --> 40:54.830]  Or the one where he made him think he hit the half-court basketball shot with his eyes closed.
[40:54.970 --> 40:56.110]  Yeah, when he was blindfolded.
[40:57.230 --> 41:00.330]  I briefly played Mario Kart with Amir for a few nights.
[41:00.710 --> 41:02.370]  And all of our... we weren't talking.
[41:02.450 --> 41:03.310]  We didn't have like voice chat.
[41:03.310 --> 41:09.010]  So all of our DMs to each other are just like in the moment messages about that particular Mario Kart race.
[41:09.110 --> 41:11.490]  So our DMs make absolutely no sense.
[41:12.250 --> 41:13.170]  That's fucking funny.
[41:16.470 --> 41:18.030]  Andrew, are you still able to talk?
[41:21.510 --> 41:22.650]  Eric, are you done pissing?
[41:22.910 --> 41:24.090]  Do you want to be Andrew while he's gone?
[41:24.270 --> 41:26.070]  Yeah, I've been back for a while.
[41:26.170 --> 41:28.350]  This episode has made me feel weird.
[41:28.530 --> 41:29.870]  I feel weird.
[41:30.110 --> 41:30.890]  I feel different.
[41:31.030 --> 41:32.030]  I feel like a different person.
[41:32.030 --> 41:33.730]  I just don't know what you do.
[41:33.890 --> 41:37.230]  This all started because he wanted to print the law.
[41:37.530 --> 41:38.790]  Not even in this episode.
[41:39.050 --> 41:40.590]  And now we're in the situation that we're in.
[41:40.690 --> 41:41.550]  I know what you mean.
[41:41.690 --> 41:44.230]  I wouldn't say I feel weird, but I don't feel good.
[41:44.770 --> 41:48.410]  Nick said that this is the writer's strike episode equivalent.
[41:48.650 --> 41:50.010]  And I couldn't agree more with that.
[41:50.150 --> 41:53.630]  He said that season three is typically a good season.
[41:53.730 --> 41:57.290]  And then now we're into season four and it's really falling apart.
[41:58.790 --> 42:03.050]  It's genuinely hard to get worse at something that you do all the time.
[42:03.210 --> 42:06.030]  But I think we've proven that possible time and time again.
[42:10.790 --> 42:11.350]  Andrew!
[42:13.510 --> 42:15.750]  I am so sorry.
[42:17.070 --> 42:19.010]  I just wanted to know the laws.
[42:19.530 --> 42:22.690]  I just wanted to know the laws.
[42:22.690 --> 42:27.670]  We might have to create some official f***face laws about how we conduct ourselves.
[42:29.270 --> 42:32.950]  The things we're allowed to do in the periphery while we're recording.
[42:33.710 --> 42:34.710]  Oh my god.
[42:35.030 --> 42:37.530]  Do you know the law now?
[42:38.890 --> 42:39.850]  No, it's dead.
[42:43.510 --> 42:45.690]  He sounds like he's going through a blender.
[42:46.950 --> 42:47.390]  Sorry.
[42:48.450 --> 42:49.670]  I want to take that blender and I want to...
[42:49.670 --> 42:50.650]  Wait, are you supposed to sound like I'm on a blender?
[42:50.650 --> 42:58.650]  You know in all the movies when a robot is being destroyed and right at the last minute it starts talking like the voice box is all broken?
[42:59.010 --> 43:01.430]  You sound like a dying robot from any movie.
[43:01.530 --> 43:02.930]  Right now, still.
[43:03.230 --> 43:04.370]  You're Hal from 2001.
[43:05.470 --> 43:06.610]  You're Ash from Alien.
[43:07.570 --> 43:12.870]  Well, here's the thing. You sound better now, but I know as soon as we say that you're going to drop out again.
[43:13.910 --> 43:16.590]  I'm not touching anything. I haven't touched anything for a while.
[43:16.590 --> 43:17.650]  I'm scared.
[43:17.770 --> 43:21.130]  Nick said he's stuck between 2021 and 2022.
[43:22.510 --> 43:23.630]  He's stuck between seasons.
[43:23.730 --> 43:26.350]  It's a problem. He's still got one foot in season three.
[43:26.790 --> 43:28.390]  Yeah, we've left that behind, Andrew.
[43:29.450 --> 43:29.890]  Andrew?
[43:32.330 --> 43:34.670]  Well, at least we're not stepping over each other.
[43:37.490 --> 43:41.790]  Gav, what do you want to do for the next eight minutes or so before we can stop this?
[43:41.950 --> 43:43.230]  Eric, what have you got for this week?
[43:43.990 --> 43:45.190]  Let me think.
[43:45.290 --> 43:49.950]  We have some really interesting merchandise coming out.
[43:49.950 --> 43:52.290]  You don't have to sell stuff. What have you got in general?
[43:52.570 --> 43:56.170]  What are you looking forward to in 2022, Eric?
[43:56.630 --> 43:56.910]  Wrestling?
[43:57.650 --> 44:03.790]  You know, I'm looking forward to some of our podcasts going on tour. Not this one, but other podcasts going on tour.
[44:04.430 --> 44:05.950]  I'm looking forward to traveling.
[44:06.570 --> 44:08.270]  You don't think this one's going to go on tour?
[44:08.270 --> 44:14.610]  Oh no, this one's allowed, but trying to coordinate to get it on tour has been increasingly difficult.
[44:15.130 --> 44:16.930]  It's going to happen. It's got to happen.
[44:17.470 --> 44:18.850]  I mean, I'd love for it to happen.
[44:19.750 --> 44:22.450]  It's going to have to happen. It's going to have to happen in Vancouver.
[44:22.770 --> 44:25.190]  We're going to have to go to Andrew, and it needs to happen.
[44:25.270 --> 44:27.370]  I don't give a shit about doing the podcast on tour.
[44:27.570 --> 44:29.850]  I don't give a shit about doing it in front of an audience or any of that stuff.
[44:29.950 --> 44:33.270]  What I care about is crabbing. I care about bathtub races.
[44:33.510 --> 44:37.290]  I care about all the stuff we're going to film when we go to Canada.
[44:37.290 --> 44:42.950]  The podcast tour is just an excuse to get us together so that we can film shit in Canada.
[44:42.990 --> 44:48.270]  Well, I was told that the original idea of going to Canada for this podcast tour is not doable,
[44:48.450 --> 44:50.750]  so the earliest we could do it would maybe 2023.
[44:51.630 --> 44:51.830]  What?
[44:55.030 --> 44:58.290]  But we can try to go to Canada otherwise.
[44:58.490 --> 44:59.590]  Yeah, we've got so much to do.
[45:00.010 --> 45:01.890]  We've got to have dinner in Andrew's bath.
[45:02.630 --> 45:04.070]  We've got to find Andrew's house.
[45:06.290 --> 45:14.110]  Well, if we go to Vancouver or whatever to go record with Andrew, we have to bring a lot of equipment.
[45:14.470 --> 45:14.690]  You do.
[45:14.790 --> 45:18.490]  Because there's no way we can use fucking anything that Andrew has.
[45:18.570 --> 45:21.210]  Well, we could be tripping over the law just to get in.
[45:21.310 --> 45:22.330]  Oh, no.
[45:24.290 --> 45:25.430]  I'm so sorry.
[45:25.710 --> 45:28.190]  We have to film a fireplace video in Vancouver.
[45:28.850 --> 45:33.150]  Yeah, if this wasn't free, I would be giving everyone a refund this podcast.
[45:34.850 --> 45:37.630]  You know what, audience? I'm going to give you a free fund.
[45:38.370 --> 45:42.930]  You didn't pay anything, but it's an emotional thing.
[45:43.030 --> 45:44.470]  I'm giving you a little...
[45:45.290 --> 45:47.510]  Now, your time, though, that's gone.
[45:47.910 --> 45:48.750]  We can't give you that back.
[45:48.770 --> 45:49.750]  I can't do anything about that, yeah.
[45:50.450 --> 45:54.350]  But just know that we wasted potentially more of it making this than you did listening to it.
[45:55.490 --> 45:58.230]  Oh, we're getting the kinks out for the tuxedo now.
[45:58.470 --> 45:59.150]  It's all that matters.
[45:59.310 --> 46:00.070]  I will be prepared.
[46:00.190 --> 46:02.410]  I will be good to go.
[46:02.410 --> 46:10.430]  If that goes flawlessly, if we record and the tuxedo works and we have no technical issues, I'm jumping out a window.
[46:10.910 --> 46:13.390]  I'll flip. I'll fucking flip.
[46:14.370 --> 46:16.910]  Do we have the tech worked out for the tuxedo?
[46:17.350 --> 46:20.530]  I assume we'd all just be watching at the same time or on our own feet.
[46:20.670 --> 46:24.050]  I think that I can host it.
[46:24.150 --> 46:27.910]  I'll just get you guys a program that's very easy so you can view my screen in real time.
[46:28.490 --> 46:29.210]  Yeah, that'd be good.
[46:29.210 --> 46:32.790]  Instead of doing it over Discord, because I don't trust whatever Andrew just said.
[46:33.210 --> 46:36.670]  Andrew's going to sit on his remote, Geoff's going to spit Dr. Pepper on his, it's going to be a mess.
[46:36.930 --> 46:39.090]  Having to re-sync is going to be a whole thing.
[46:39.710 --> 46:43.850]  Are we afraid of tuxedo or audio bleed coming into our commentary or anything?
[46:44.110 --> 46:46.050]  I don't care. Just wear your headphones and you'll be fine.
[46:47.670 --> 46:53.210]  The episode that's just come out this week was, I think, the first episode of Season 3.
[46:53.490 --> 46:56.330]  Should we just tweet and tell everyone that Season 3 is over already?
[46:57.470 --> 47:01.950]  I can't say what, I can't say why, but Season 3 has ended.
[47:02.270 --> 47:04.730]  Season 3 got two behind the eye.
[47:07.370 --> 47:08.190]  Yeah, we should.
[47:08.470 --> 47:11.830]  This one's coming together, though. I think we've got a significant amount.
[47:12.830 --> 47:17.970]  I think this is a fine... I mean, why am I fucking talking? I don't know what happens for 80% of the show.
[47:18.070 --> 47:20.430]  I'm the least... I can't evaluate this.
[47:20.450 --> 47:24.230]  You're talking... play catch up, motherfucker. We need your word count. Gavin and I are out of juice.
[47:26.610 --> 47:30.110]  According to Audacity, I've been recording for 18 minutes, so...
[47:30.690 --> 47:31.130]  What?
[47:31.530 --> 47:31.830]  What?
[47:32.930 --> 47:33.330]  What's that?
[47:33.690 --> 47:34.730]  Oh, poor Nick.
[47:35.430 --> 47:36.610]  What do you mean?
[47:37.050 --> 47:38.150]  What do you mean?
[47:38.690 --> 47:44.330]  Also, we should probably talk about something that Andrew told me in confidence about last week's recording.
[47:44.450 --> 47:45.450]  Oh, yeah? What's that?
[47:46.810 --> 47:49.130]  Is Andrew even going to object to this? Is he even here?
[47:49.370 --> 47:52.570]  I don't think he's here anymore. Yeah, so you can just do it. He'll never hear this.
[47:54.230 --> 47:54.850]  He...
[47:55.930 --> 47:57.910]  Now Richard says he's typing!
[48:03.110 --> 48:04.600]  Geoff, when you pitched...
[48:06.550 --> 48:09.450]  Andrew said, I'm going to go set the law on God.
[48:09.910 --> 48:13.370]  Fire, fic, fuck. Oh my God.
[48:13.790 --> 48:15.430]  He can't even type straight.
[48:17.230 --> 48:21.930]  Screenshot that. I quit. Fire, fic, fuck.
[48:21.930 --> 48:28.250]  Is Jack doing a read of this? Of what this episode is? Because it's insane.
[48:28.530 --> 48:35.750]  Because in the middle of everyone going, no, Andrew, stop, it's just Nick linking to Home Alone The Holiday Heist.
[48:36.910 --> 48:39.230]  And there's some stuff about his car at the top.
[48:42.270 --> 48:43.590]  Oh my God.
[48:43.930 --> 48:50.830]  Andrew admitted to me last week that while he was recording, he, for some reason, had to stop recording for like a minute.
[48:50.830 --> 48:54.510]  And then just resumed his file.
[48:55.990 --> 49:01.310]  So without even mentioning it to Nick, so that he knew that the edit would go out of sync.
[49:02.690 --> 49:04.530]  Nick said that exploits a lot.
[49:05.350 --> 49:07.650]  So I guess his file just skipped forward.
[49:08.550 --> 49:12.050]  And I was like, well, you got to tell him. He's like, I can't bring myself to tell him.
[49:13.750 --> 49:16.290]  Nick, how did that go for you? What did you have to figure out?
[49:16.570 --> 49:19.250]  I should have just told you, shouldn't I? I had the information too.
[49:21.150 --> 49:21.950]  You're part of the problem.
[49:23.610 --> 49:27.770]  Nick probably missed a fucking milestone with his kid because he had to spend extra time editing.
[49:28.470 --> 49:29.410]  Yeah, Nick, what happened?
[49:29.810 --> 49:34.710]  I looked up and there was this huge desync. And I was like, oh, and usually it's by like a quarter of a second.
[49:35.070 --> 49:41.730]  But instead it was like by ten. He started laughing at nothing. Like it was just silence and then him laughing into the void.
[49:42.970 --> 49:49.530]  It was super bizarre. So finally I figured out what he, or I figured, I was like, oh, his computer is just stupid. So I backed it up.
[49:49.530 --> 49:50.830]  But now that I know that.
[49:51.110 --> 49:53.530]  Yeah, it's his computer. Yeah, his computer messed up.
[49:53.550 --> 49:54.550]  Look at today.
[49:55.490 --> 50:01.030]  We, uh, I think we, this might be the hardest we've faced ourselves in a while.
[50:01.130 --> 50:02.150]  Oh, big time.
[50:02.470 --> 50:04.650]  Which 18 minutes do you think Andrew has?
[50:06.370 --> 50:09.870]  He's got 18 minutes of him going, well, I think...
[50:12.770 --> 50:18.710]  We should take Andrew's raw recording from today and press that onto vinyl and just give that to people.
[50:19.570 --> 50:24.430]  I just came back in her 30 seconds. Great, Andrew. Fucking awesome.
[50:25.370 --> 50:28.710]  He didn't like it one bit. He didn't like what he was hearing.
[50:29.930 --> 50:34.450]  Reboot! I would have rebooted 25 minutes ago. Why wouldn't he do it?
[50:34.710 --> 50:35.690]  Oh my God.
[50:35.870 --> 50:39.390]  How is this better than the two minutes it would take to reboot and restart?
[50:39.910 --> 50:42.150]  Oh man, this is incredible.
[50:42.590 --> 50:43.990]  Is the law preventing a reboot?
[50:44.410 --> 50:44.710]  Maybe.
[50:45.510 --> 50:45.890]  Yeah.
[50:47.210 --> 50:50.050]  Can the episode title be, I'm gonna set the law on Gaia?
[50:51.370 --> 50:54.910]  It's against the law to stop the law during printing.
[50:56.170 --> 51:03.130]  Oh, I got one piece of, just a minor housekeeping, because I know you guys are so fucking concerned about my physical health.
[51:03.650 --> 51:06.970]  I got the results of my x-rays back. On my hips.
[51:07.510 --> 51:09.950]  Sorry, I can't, I'm just looking at what Andrew's typing.
[51:10.310 --> 51:11.270]  Didn't like it.
[51:12.910 --> 51:16.930]  Didn't like it one bit. No, no, bib, you fuck, or ha did.
[51:17.990 --> 51:18.790]  Bella Hadid.
[51:19.010 --> 51:19.130]  What?
[51:19.230 --> 51:22.230]  We have to ignore Andrew for a sec and listen to the x-ray results.
[51:22.470 --> 51:23.690]  What happened at the x-ray school?
[51:23.910 --> 51:29.770]  Well, they were brief. I got a very quick email that just said, nothing on x-rays.
[51:30.130 --> 51:33.930]  However, you do have arthritis in your spine.
[51:34.190 --> 51:36.270]  And I don't know what that means. That's all he said.
[51:36.670 --> 51:40.250]  He just said, I'm like, I guess I gotta fucking, I was like, okay?
[51:40.250 --> 51:43.030]  So I guess I need to make a follow-up or something.
[51:43.390 --> 51:44.730]  You're in your 40s.
[51:44.790 --> 51:45.410]  Time to feed the dogs.
[51:45.710 --> 51:49.290]  Well, I already have arthritis in my shoulder. That's well documented.
[51:50.010 --> 51:50.790]  Yeah, but the back.
[51:51.690 --> 51:53.290]  Yeah, and my spine.
[51:53.890 --> 51:55.290]  So, I'll take that as good news.
[51:55.650 --> 52:00.270]  So, just real quick, I'm just thinking like top of mind stuff or whatever.
[52:01.370 --> 52:02.990]  Throw an 80 still or what's up?
[52:03.310 --> 52:07.150]  Well, that's a great question. That'd be a big part of 2022, right?
[52:07.150 --> 52:09.450]  I'm definitely off on my timeline.
[52:10.670 --> 52:18.410]  I don't think I'm going to get there on my 90 day window or whatever, because I haven't been able to, I mean, you know, get on a bicycle or lift and like it's been rough.
[52:18.770 --> 52:23.990]  But now that I know that structurally, my hips are fine, and I'm just dealing with arthritis in my spine.
[52:24.490 --> 52:28.170]  I mean, it doesn't change the fact that I have a lot of pain still in that leg.
[52:28.190 --> 52:30.450]  So I guess I gotta figure that out.
[52:30.770 --> 52:34.410]  But at least I know there's nothing like structurally wrong.
[52:34.410 --> 52:38.190]  So I think it all is good as a good sign that I can get back to my training now.
[52:38.290 --> 52:44.370]  I'm going to attempt to ride a bike for the first time in over a month this weekend, and we'll see how that goes.
[52:44.470 --> 52:46.410]  And then if that goes well, then I'm going to start throwing 80!
[52:46.970 --> 52:48.010]  This is the bike that pedals for you.
[52:48.090 --> 52:50.750]  Yeah, it's the sitting part that's hard, not the pedaling part.
[52:50.830 --> 52:52.190]  Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.
[52:52.250 --> 52:53.050]  Okay, that makes sense.
[52:53.730 --> 52:56.210]  And then I'm sure Andrew has a lot he wants to say now, so take it away.
[52:56.550 --> 52:57.170]  Yeah, Andrew, go ahead.
[52:58.370 --> 52:59.890]  Just whatever's on your mind.
[52:59.890 --> 53:03.310]  I didn't like it one bit. No. M. N. Bib.
[53:04.290 --> 53:08.990]  You fuck. O. R. Had. The hair did.
[53:11.170 --> 53:14.890]  We'll have to screenshot that, right? We'll have to screenshot that and...
[53:15.770 --> 53:18.570]  One day this Discord chat will make a tremendous book.
[53:18.830 --> 53:22.190]  Oh, so Jack has to read through all this, too. So that's pretty exciting.
[53:22.350 --> 53:27.210]  I wonder if he's going to be able to even do a preview, or if he's just going to say the episode exploded.
[53:27.450 --> 53:28.690]  Like, what's he going to say about this?
[53:28.690 --> 53:35.270]  It's a great question. He also said, this is the perfect episode to introduce a new person to the... Do you think so?
[53:35.610 --> 53:39.630]  I mean, I guess it is the letter of the... I mean, it's within the spirit of the name.
[53:42.030 --> 53:44.850]  What does it say about us that we actually put this one out?
[53:45.610 --> 53:48.110]  What does it say? We have zero quality control?
[53:48.510 --> 53:51.290]  Oh, yeah, that we have other things to do?
[53:51.590 --> 53:53.930]  That we ran out of hours to make anything else?
[53:56.630 --> 53:59.110]  Andrew's not even here anymore. He's just gone.
[53:59.250 --> 54:01.190]  Why doesn't he reboot?
[54:01.690 --> 54:06.770]  He's one of the hosts. He's one of the main hosts. He does the intro sometimes.
[54:07.470 --> 54:09.790]  Sometimes. He did ads last week, yeah.
[54:10.250 --> 54:12.110]  Which I appreciated, because I couldn't get to it.
[54:13.410 --> 54:18.050]  Well, I... Fuck, dude. I guess we should stop. Don't you have to go play video games or something, Gav?
[54:18.390 --> 54:19.930]  You have to play Pinball Machine or something?
[54:19.990 --> 54:21.990]  I have to go to an arcade and do a bit of filming.
[54:22.490 --> 54:25.590]  Sorry this episode was bad. Gavin has to go to the arcade.
[54:25.750 --> 54:27.910]  I'm the only one who didn't leave in the middle of it.
[54:28.350 --> 54:30.910]  Listen, I only left for one second.
[54:31.470 --> 54:32.810]  I left for one second.
[54:33.350 --> 54:34.330]  That's fair. That's fair.
[54:34.770 --> 54:37.170]  And it was only because of your talent.
[54:37.630 --> 54:39.130]  If anything, it's your fault.
[54:39.790 --> 54:41.310]  I'll take the blame. I'm happy with that blame.
[54:41.850 --> 54:43.230]  Nick stayed the whole time, that's true.
[54:43.390 --> 54:46.330]  Well, now you did it, Nick! You moved a carpet with your wife! You already said that!
[54:46.750 --> 54:47.390]  Well, that was the last episode.
[54:48.010 --> 54:49.830]  Oh, first recording, okay.
[54:49.830 --> 54:52.710]  I was here the whole time for the first recording.
[54:53.010 --> 54:53.750]  That's nothing.
[54:54.030 --> 54:59.210]  Look, there's something to be said, though, about setting an incredibly low bar at the beginning of something.
[54:59.610 --> 55:00.870]  Yeah, it's hard to trip over.
[55:01.490 --> 55:03.090]  Yeah, we'll do well to be worse than this.
[55:03.690 --> 55:04.790]  That's a good point.
[55:05.530 --> 55:13.010]  And if that's not a selling point for tuning in for the next 365 days of f***face content, I don't know what is.
[55:13.090 --> 55:14.810]  It can't get worse.
[55:14.810 --> 55:20.490]  That means next week, when you tune in and listen to it, it's gonna be at least this good.
[55:20.610 --> 55:23.630]  But probably, like, slightly better.
[55:23.830 --> 55:26.210]  Yeah, we might be at the beginning of a pretty severe dip.
[55:26.690 --> 55:29.430]  It only goes up from here, the f***face story. That's right, Nick.
[55:34.080 --> 55:35.800]  Well, I guess I'm done.
[55:37.960 --> 55:40.360]  Nick, Gavin, Eric, you guys got anything else?
[55:40.640 --> 55:44.720]  You can check out store.roosterteeth.com for all the cool f***face merch we have out now.
[55:44.720 --> 55:47.400]  Go check it out. I'm sure there's some things that we didn't even know went up.
[55:47.940 --> 55:50.160]  Boys of Zimmer, etc. Go check it out.
[55:50.320 --> 55:55.460]  Yeah, and I'm pretty sure that the f***sticks are on the way. Don't forget about those.
[55:55.720 --> 55:58.640]  Also, we've got the metal bread clips coming.
[55:59.540 --> 56:01.160]  Three Socks, We're Gonna Solve a Murder.
[56:01.460 --> 56:05.460]  And I believe the Community Christmas album came out.
[56:05.640 --> 56:10.180]  And I was just starting to listen to it last night. It was very good, so give that a shot, too.
[56:11.080 --> 56:16.700]  Why do you think Folgers trademarked the piece of foil that goes over the top of their coffee?
[56:18.000 --> 56:18.560]  Excuse me?
[56:19.160 --> 56:25.260]  Like, when you open it and it says Aromaseal TM. Like, what's special about their piece of foil?
[56:26.200 --> 56:27.460]  Well, I guess seal's in the aroma.
[56:28.120 --> 56:31.700]  Yeah, I just feel like there's seals on everything. They don't all have fancy names.
[56:32.260 --> 56:33.340]  You drink a lot of Folgers?
[56:33.980 --> 56:37.260]  I'll drink Folgers in an emergency, yeah, if I've got, like, old beans or something.
[56:38.380 --> 56:39.260]  Gammy old beans.
[56:40.420 --> 56:43.760]  I'm not criticizing, it is the best part of waking up.
[56:45.620 --> 56:47.440]  Yes, that is what they say.
[56:50.720 --> 56:55.060]  As someone who hand grinds your beans, Eric, do you have a stoop as low as Folgers?
[56:55.820 --> 57:00.720]  Like, if I have to, if I'm on set and there's coffee and that's it, yeah, but it gives me a headache.
[57:01.140 --> 57:03.400]  Like, the taste gives me a headache.
[57:03.400 --> 57:09.540]  I think it's just, but I think that's linked to, like, that smell from, like, when I was a kid or, like, school or something.
[57:09.680 --> 57:13.760]  I don't think that it's, like, the coffee necessarily that gives me a headache. I think it's psychosomatic.
[57:15.560 --> 57:16.280]  Andrew's apologizing.
[57:16.780 --> 57:20.980]  Yeah, Andrew's back and apologizing. Andrew, are you on mic? Do you want to apologize on mic?
[57:23.680 --> 57:25.380]  No, he's maybe gone again.
[57:25.480 --> 57:31.980]  Yeah, I think he might be, I think he can talk now, he's just too embarrassed to speak.
[57:33.620 --> 57:36.520]  I wouldn't be surprised if Andrew was able to talk for the last five minutes.
[57:36.920 --> 57:38.880]  Andrew, do you want to do the outro?
[57:40.160 --> 57:41.960]  Andrew, do you want to do the outro, buddy?
[57:43.700 --> 57:44.520]  It's all yours.
[57:46.600 --> 57:47.620]  Say whatever you want.
[57:49.320 --> 57:52.720]  Well, there you go, Andrew Panton, as always, a man of few words.
[57:53.180 --> 57:54.260]  Thanks for listening.
[57:54.940 --> 57:56.780]  He said the log on him.
[57:56.980 --> 57:57.920]  I threw the book at him.
[58:02.140 --> 58:12.020]  Oh, man, I swear to God, if you listen to the next episode, it will be better than this.
[58:12.100 --> 58:15.160]  Do not do not give up on us today.
[58:15.320 --> 58:16.800]  It can only get better.
[58:16.880 --> 58:18.880]  2022 is going to be a good year.
[58:18.880 --> 58:19.640]  I swear.
[58:19.940 --> 58:23.880]  We just had to get all the dog shit out of the way, out the gate.
[58:23.880 --> 58:27.940]  Last time we were talking about which episodes people were recommending to their friends.
[58:28.100 --> 58:29.720]  Just make sure it's not this one.
[58:30.680 --> 58:31.660]  Never this one.
[58:33.440 --> 58:37.320]  Episode one of season four, or the forgotten episode, as they call it.
[58:39.520 --> 58:40.880]  Also, like and subscribe.
[58:44.700 --> 58:45.340]  Bye bye.
[58:45.940 --> 58:46.360]  Bye now.
[58:47.340 --> 58:51.660]  Hey guys, Minor League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[58:51.660 --> 58:53.920]  It's the Bobcat and Steve show.
[58:54.460 --> 58:56.500]  Andrew is most certainly a shorts guy.
[58:56.900 --> 58:58.060]  Gavin likes toys.
[58:58.440 --> 59:00.360]  Geoff discusses a sucky new invention.
[59:00.860 --> 59:02.040]  Andrew's bed is broken.
[59:02.560 --> 59:03.980]  Did you know about the Canadian McGriddle?
[59:04.400 --> 59:07.400]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[59:07.880 --> 59:10.480]  All this and more on the next episode of F*** Face.
