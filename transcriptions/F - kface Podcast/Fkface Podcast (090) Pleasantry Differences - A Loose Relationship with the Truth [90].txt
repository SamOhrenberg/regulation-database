[00:15.040 --> 00:17.300]  I'm rolling in the pleasantries. Yeah, me too.
[00:17.420 --> 00:20.440]  It's the pleasantries part. It's a great song. Good day to you all.
[00:20.680 --> 00:23.400]  How is everyone feeling today? I couldn't be better.
[00:23.640 --> 00:27.440]  I learned last night that Macho Man had a rap album in 2003.
[00:27.780 --> 00:32.080]  And so I listened to all of it. It's better than you'd expect it to be,
[00:32.140 --> 00:36.680]  but not good, obviously. But there is a childlike joy to all of it.
[00:36.680 --> 00:39.300]  How does it compare to Stevo? Does Stevo have an album?
[00:39.300 --> 00:41.880]  Oh, yeah. He has some rap. I have not heard...
[00:41.880 --> 00:44.880]  I will... Okay, I will listen. I'll listen to Stevo's...
[00:44.880 --> 00:47.420]  Is it a full album or is he just like rapped on a few songs?
[00:47.620 --> 00:50.080]  How does it compare to Sal the Stockbroker's rap album?
[00:51.060 --> 00:53.580]  Oh, man. Pre-John Gotti.
[00:56.380 --> 01:02.300]  One of the songs... Well, first of all, can you come back to an industry you were never part of?
[01:02.700 --> 01:07.580]  Because the opening track is called I'm Back and the whole hook is that Macho Man's back,
[01:07.580 --> 01:11.680]  but he never rapped before. And I get he's saying like I'm back in the public eye,
[01:11.860 --> 01:17.180]  but I don't think you could declare you're back to a thing that is your first appearance of.
[01:17.680 --> 01:20.540]  When would you say he first left the public eye?
[01:21.000 --> 01:22.800]  Like when did his popularity first wane?
[01:25.460 --> 01:26.340]  2000... 2001?
[01:27.620 --> 01:31.620]  I would say 2000 because that was the folding... Hi, welcome to the wrestling part of the show.
[01:31.620 --> 01:37.460]  This WCW folded in 2000, and when WCW got bought by WWF,
[01:38.240 --> 01:45.460]  that contract that Macho Man might have maybe had within WCW, he didn't go.
[01:45.640 --> 01:49.060]  But he did make one more appearance in 2004, but that was it.
[01:49.200 --> 01:50.740]  Like he was done with wrestling in 2000.
[01:51.500 --> 01:54.600]  So he was back after a three-year hiatus then.
[01:54.780 --> 01:56.380]  That's a pretty decent hiatus.
[01:56.920 --> 02:01.040]  I think that also came in 2003 was his Spider-Man cameo in the Tobey Maguire movie.
[02:01.040 --> 02:03.980]  This is the hook of the opening track.
[02:04.480 --> 02:06.540]  People want to know if Macho's still in the ring.
[02:06.660 --> 02:08.160]  In my head I always go, he isn't.
[02:08.160 --> 02:10.020]  As soon as that finishes, then it goes,
[02:10.300 --> 02:12.300]  People want to know if Randy's doing his thing.
[02:12.480 --> 02:14.780]  He's not, is immediately what falls in my head.
[02:15.100 --> 02:17.540]  Then everybody's talking, want to know this and that.
[02:17.640 --> 02:19.840]  So I'm telling you right now, Randy Savage is back.
[02:20.020 --> 02:21.540]  Which always leaves me wondering, is he?
[02:21.840 --> 02:23.580]  Like he's here, but I don't, as I said,
[02:23.980 --> 02:26.540]  I don't think you can come back to a thing that you've never done before.
[02:26.780 --> 02:29.660]  But more importantly, Macho Man means a thing.
[02:29.660 --> 02:32.100]  And I'll just go through it because I love it.
[02:32.140 --> 02:33.240]  I love what it means.
[02:33.380 --> 02:35.600]  I think it's beautifully stupid.
[02:36.640 --> 02:38.640]  The M's because I push it to the maximum.
[02:39.280 --> 02:41.820]  And the A's for the aura that they try to become.
[02:42.240 --> 02:44.720]  The C's for the champ six times I became.
[02:45.220 --> 02:47.780]  And the H's for honor, I'm in the hall of fame.
[02:48.200 --> 02:50.900]  The O's for oh yeah, because I'm so outstanding.
[02:51.380 --> 02:53.660]  The M's for Macho, I'm the last man standing.
[02:53.900 --> 02:57.220]  I love he has two M's and one of them means something.
[02:57.320 --> 02:59.020]  And the other M just means Macho.
[02:59.020 --> 03:01.700]  Which is the first part of his name.
[03:01.700 --> 03:05.080]  Well, I don't think he could have said the M in Macho is Macho.
[03:05.520 --> 03:06.940]  He had to put it on the other M.
[03:07.740 --> 03:12.660]  Didn't you also just say that the C is for six champions?
[03:12.820 --> 03:13.960]  I guess, okay, yeah.
[03:14.200 --> 03:16.860]  Yes, it is. For the champ six times.
[03:17.020 --> 03:20.980]  He made the C champion, but the next letter in Macho is H.
[03:21.480 --> 03:24.040]  So he could have just had the CH be champion.
[03:24.840 --> 03:26.000]  Right, but what was the H?
[03:26.580 --> 03:28.080]  As in lump them together.
[03:28.080 --> 03:31.020]  No, no, I understand, but then we would lose what the H was for.
[03:31.420 --> 03:33.620]  Right, because he's in the hall of fame.
[03:33.780 --> 03:35.100]  Wow, I can't believe you remember that.
[03:35.100 --> 03:40.260]  Also crazy that he came up with that nickname before he'd won the six championships.
[03:40.500 --> 03:41.220]  But that's what it meant.
[03:42.520 --> 03:44.780]  He looked at his name later and thought, that's convenient.
[03:45.540 --> 03:49.920]  I just think, I just, I mean, I don't want to talk shit on Macho Man Randy Savage
[03:49.920 --> 03:53.160]  who delighted and entertained me my entire childhood.
[03:53.260 --> 03:55.620]  But I think there might be some retrofitting going on there.
[03:55.620 --> 03:57.340]  I would agree with that.
[03:57.700 --> 03:58.540]  It's interesting.
[03:58.720 --> 04:00.400]  I didn't know it existed.
[04:00.940 --> 04:02.600]  It's 46 minutes long.
[04:03.240 --> 04:06.340]  There's a love song in it, a love rap, which is great.
[04:06.460 --> 04:12.040]  There's a very heartfelt, like, remembering his friend song to close the album.
[04:12.740 --> 04:14.380]  It's a weird, fun listen.
[04:14.660 --> 04:15.520]  It's very bizarre.
[04:16.060 --> 04:19.680]  But that's been my music for like the past 12 hours.
[04:19.900 --> 04:20.720]  Just on loop.
[04:20.860 --> 04:22.480]  Does he talk about Miss Elizabeth in it at all?
[04:22.480 --> 04:27.140]  I don't think he does, but I wondered if the love song applied to Miss Elizabeth.
[04:27.440 --> 04:29.360]  The love song was about Mr. Perfect.
[04:29.900 --> 04:30.360]  No!
[04:30.960 --> 04:31.080]  Yes!
[04:31.580 --> 04:33.940]  No, that's the in-memory song. There's two different songs.
[04:34.420 --> 04:37.880]  There's one that is in dedication to his best friend, Mr. Perfect.
[04:38.360 --> 04:40.300]  I think it's called My Perfect Friend.
[04:40.800 --> 04:46.420]  And there's one prior that is just a Macho Man love song called What's That All About?
[04:46.660 --> 04:48.100]  The chorus to the song is,
[04:48.100 --> 04:50.520]  First you love me, then you hate me,
[04:50.680 --> 04:52.640]  Wanna leave me, pretty lady,
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  Can you tell me, what's that all about?
[04:57.320 --> 04:59.140]  Do you think...
[05:00.020 --> 05:01.820]  Do you think he wrote all this?
[05:02.280 --> 05:03.860]  No, absolutely not.
[05:04.280 --> 05:08.540]  I forget who, uh, there's one person that was credited for most of these songs, and it was not him.
[05:08.920 --> 05:14.260]  Are there any famous guest spots? Does, like, 50 Cent drop a bar or, uh...
[05:14.260 --> 05:19.120]  I wish. There are a few features on it of names I don't recognize,
[05:19.400 --> 05:22.640]  but they're people that have clearly rapped for a lot longer than he has.
[05:23.020 --> 05:28.780]  And when you're only listening to him rap, you kind of forget what, like, the level of skill difference is
[05:28.780 --> 05:30.460]  between somebody that actually does this.
[05:30.600 --> 05:36.140]  And it makes those songs glaring how not great at it he is, despite his attempt.
[05:36.660 --> 05:37.760]  You can tell he tried real hard.
[05:37.760 --> 05:39.440]  It makes me wonder about him, right?
[05:39.500 --> 05:44.920]  Because he's been famous and a part of popular culture almost my entire life, you know,
[05:45.000 --> 05:46.520]  growing up in the early 80s.
[05:47.560 --> 05:52.040]  And so, I've seen him around in a million things throughout my life.
[05:52.100 --> 05:53.780]  I've never seen him out of character.
[05:54.200 --> 05:55.940]  I always wonder with a guy like that,
[05:56.660 --> 06:00.060]  like, where does Randy Savage begin?
[06:00.500 --> 06:01.720]  Or where does, you know what I mean?
[06:01.780 --> 06:03.400]  And Macho Man end?
[06:03.400 --> 06:12.380]  How different is he at home, right now, in his living room, watching CNN or QVC
[06:12.380 --> 06:14.840]  than the character he personifies?
[06:15.260 --> 06:18.780]  I was going to say the main difference is he doesn't hate Hulk Hogan, but no, he does.
[06:19.720 --> 06:23.000]  There's a diss track aimed at Hulk Hogan in the album.
[06:23.400 --> 06:27.120]  He's not wrestling. He just hates Hulk Hogan and wants him to know that.
[06:27.340 --> 06:30.340]  I think everybody who worked with Hulk Hogan seems to hate him.
[06:30.380 --> 06:31.360]  It seems that way.
[06:31.360 --> 06:33.140]  He seems to be terrible.
[06:33.520 --> 06:36.320]  Which is unfortunate as someone who loved him as a child.
[06:36.800 --> 06:37.260]  He sucks.
[06:37.840 --> 06:40.540]  Maybe he's terrible, maybe it's jealousy, who knows?
[06:40.740 --> 06:42.740]  No, I think he's terrible. I think he just sucks.
[06:43.380 --> 06:44.160]  I'll say it.
[06:44.600 --> 06:45.900]  I don't know the man personally.
[06:46.480 --> 06:49.140]  I don't either, but everything I know about him, he sucks.
[06:49.880 --> 06:50.180]  He's terrible.
[06:50.560 --> 06:51.900]  Strong words from Andrew Pantin.
[06:52.200 --> 06:53.820]  Looking to fight Hulk Hogan.
[06:54.340 --> 06:56.400]  I already have the director of the tuxedo mad at me.
[06:56.460 --> 06:57.460]  I'm willing to take on Hulk Hogan.
[06:58.520 --> 06:59.520]  Why stop now?
[06:59.520 --> 07:01.540]  Sorry, Pleasantries are over, guys.
[07:02.100 --> 07:02.860]  Oh, they're done!
[07:03.780 --> 07:07.680]  You know what? It's funny you mentioned Pleasantries.
[07:08.280 --> 07:10.460]  We recorded two episodes last week.
[07:10.920 --> 07:12.940]  And I almost died of laughter in one.
[07:13.180 --> 07:16.000]  Over a thing that I don't think is necessarily all that funny.
[07:16.420 --> 07:17.640]  But it was funny in my head.
[07:18.300 --> 07:20.680]  I love that you don't even remember it.
[07:20.680 --> 07:21.700]  What was that?
[07:22.460 --> 07:24.820]  I was talking about the Tiki Mugs.
[07:25.240 --> 07:28.060]  And it was a thing that I genuinely think is awesome.
[07:28.060 --> 07:28.840]  And really liked.
[07:28.960 --> 07:30.780]  And I felt like I was just drowning.
[07:31.280 --> 07:32.860]  Trying to talk about them genuinely.
[07:33.540 --> 07:34.940]  And I just was like the worst.
[07:35.420 --> 07:37.100]  I just couldn't get out of my own head.
[07:37.180 --> 07:38.620]  That I was just fucking bombing.
[07:39.020 --> 07:40.680]  And tanking and just sounded terrible.
[07:41.080 --> 07:42.280]  And you went, oh.
[07:42.920 --> 07:44.980]  When I brought up that it was the inversion.
[07:45.020 --> 07:46.680]  Oh yeah, I said oh wrong.
[07:47.300 --> 07:48.820]  And it broke me.
[07:49.260 --> 07:52.400]  And to the point where as soon as we finished recording.
[07:52.820 --> 07:56.820]  I went back and I went to your audio specifically to find the oh.
[07:56.820 --> 07:58.820]  The puff through my audio?
[08:00.460 --> 08:03.000]  And so I went back into your audio.
[08:03.100 --> 08:05.840]  And I was like wow, he's real quiet here at the start.
[08:05.960 --> 08:09.220]  Because you start it and you go testing, test, test, test, test.
[08:09.380 --> 08:12.460]  And then it's just silence for like an extended time.
[08:12.740 --> 08:15.700]  I was curious how much time you've spent.
[08:16.040 --> 08:19.020]  What's the longest you've spent doing your test.
[08:19.120 --> 08:21.020]  And then just waiting for the clock to run.
[08:22.320 --> 08:23.140]  Do you have a longest one?
[08:23.200 --> 08:25.140]  Is there one where you're like 7 minutes early?
[08:25.140 --> 08:26.720]  And you're like oh boy.
[08:27.420 --> 08:29.220]  Probably like 6 minutes maybe.
[08:29.800 --> 08:31.100]  Yeah, 6 minutes.
[08:31.240 --> 08:32.640]  Is that the average or is that the longest?
[08:32.660 --> 08:35.100]  Sometimes I just get rolling and then I'll go do something.
[08:35.260 --> 08:37.500]  Like I'll make a coffee or I'll maybe go pee.
[08:38.120 --> 08:39.900]  And then just at 3 I'll join the Discord.
[08:40.080 --> 08:42.280]  But yeah, I've already been rolling for a few minutes sometimes.
[08:42.600 --> 08:43.220]  That's funny.
[08:43.260 --> 08:45.460]  But that's my little secret. And Nick's.
[08:46.240 --> 08:48.380]  I love that the only difference between him and us.
[08:48.800 --> 08:52.600]  Is we click on Discord and then communicate with each other.
[08:52.780 --> 08:54.280]  He's recording just like we are.
[08:54.280 --> 08:56.520]  He's in the Discord looking at it.
[08:56.600 --> 09:01.180]  He just refuses to join us until he's contractually obligated to.
[09:01.300 --> 09:01.920]  But not today.
[09:02.300 --> 09:03.780]  I joined for some pleasantries.
[09:04.100 --> 09:06.180]  How were your pleasantries, Gav? Did you enjoy them?
[09:06.180 --> 09:09.700]  I'll be honest. They sounded pretty similar to this.
[09:10.000 --> 09:11.720]  If I'm being completely honest.
[09:11.980 --> 09:16.820]  I was unaware of where the pleasantries were different to an episode.
[09:17.020 --> 09:18.200]  Or just any normal chat.
[09:18.280 --> 09:19.360]  Or any time we've played Halo.
[09:20.220 --> 09:21.960]  I think Andrew's full of shit.
[09:21.960 --> 09:24.020]  No, to be fair.
[09:25.320 --> 09:27.080]  Nobody's ever all here for pleasantries.
[09:27.220 --> 09:29.620]  This is a rare time where everyone showed up ten minutes early.
[09:29.780 --> 09:33.200]  It's typically Nick and I will be the first ones to hop in.
[09:33.580 --> 09:38.300]  Right, so I ruined pleasantries by completing the entire cast and crew.
[09:38.400 --> 09:39.200]  Yeah, you did.
[09:40.020 --> 09:41.280]  And it's not your fault.
[09:43.160 --> 09:45.040]  If anyone's upset by this, it's me.
[09:45.400 --> 09:48.360]  I wish you got to experience the real pleasantries experience.
[09:48.680 --> 09:50.180]  But I will no longer hold it against you.
[09:50.200 --> 09:50.680]  You tried.
[09:50.680 --> 09:51.820]  I tried, yeah.
[09:51.820 --> 09:52.560]  You definitely made an attempt.
[09:53.160 --> 09:54.300]  I respect it.
[09:54.660 --> 09:58.300]  I will say, Gav, to kind of bolster where you're going with that.
[09:58.420 --> 10:00.680]  As someone who participates in pleasantries pretty often.
[10:01.400 --> 10:04.220]  As soon as I joined, Andrew was reading rap lyrics.
[10:04.400 --> 10:06.420]  And he was doing a bit about Macho Man Randy Savage.
[10:06.540 --> 10:08.360]  It felt very content-y to me.
[10:08.480 --> 10:10.860]  I even asked him. I was like, hey, is this content?
[10:11.020 --> 10:12.500]  Should we stop? Or is this pleasantries?
[10:13.180 --> 10:14.400]  I don't know if any of that...
[10:14.400 --> 10:17.000]  I assume the pleasantries won't make it in the episode.
[10:17.180 --> 10:19.080]  As Andrew said, pleasantries aren't for recording.
[10:19.180 --> 10:20.160]  So they won't be in.
[10:20.160 --> 10:22.080]  No, I feel like most of that would go in.
[10:22.520 --> 10:22.760]  What?
[10:23.520 --> 10:27.320]  Well, then why were you producing the show ten minutes early if you think it's content?
[10:27.720 --> 10:29.340]  Well, you were the one that initiated it.
[10:29.380 --> 10:30.280]  You're like, should we go?
[10:30.360 --> 10:33.000]  And then everyone started recording because you're like, is this content?
[10:33.100 --> 10:34.400]  I was just talking about a thing.
[10:34.480 --> 10:35.640]  I didn't expect it to be content.
[10:35.680 --> 10:37.980]  But I think it became content because you brought it up.
[10:38.040 --> 10:38.540]  As content.
[10:39.000 --> 10:39.360]  I don't know.
[10:39.400 --> 10:41.200]  I think you presented it as content.
[10:41.480 --> 10:42.540]  I said most of it.
[10:42.580 --> 10:43.280]  I didn't say all of it.
[10:43.640 --> 10:44.840]  I think some of it is in.
[10:45.400 --> 10:46.200]  We'll find out.
[10:46.440 --> 10:47.060]  I guess I won't.
[10:47.140 --> 10:47.980]  I don't listen to it.
[10:48.080 --> 10:48.640]  I'll never know.
[10:48.640 --> 10:51.800]  Yeah, I guess the three of us will never fucking know.
[10:51.880 --> 10:52.620]  It's up to Nick.
[10:52.920 --> 10:58.140]  While you were rifling through my raw audio file, did you find the O you were looking for?
[10:58.400 --> 11:00.640]  I did find the O I was looking for.
[11:00.760 --> 11:02.400]  And was it what you remembered?
[11:02.740 --> 11:03.580]  I can play it.
[11:03.940 --> 11:08.220]  As soon as we finished, I asked Nick to clip it and Kelly clipped both.
[11:08.420 --> 11:12.220]  It was the O and it was the next thing you said after it.
[11:12.260 --> 11:13.340]  That's what really killed me.
[11:13.340 --> 11:19.740]  I was teetering on the edge with your O because I felt it sounded so disingenuous.
[11:20.340 --> 11:21.840]  And then Geoff was talking.
[11:22.020 --> 11:23.860]  He said, oh no.
[11:24.320 --> 11:28.260]  And that came across as equally disingenuous to me.
[11:28.260 --> 11:32.600]  The thing is, to me, I just wouldn't bother saying anything if it felt disingenuous.
[11:32.760 --> 11:35.440]  I feel like I wouldn't just say something for the sake of it.
[11:35.700 --> 11:38.120]  I must have just been slightly low energy.
[11:38.540 --> 11:41.940]  But I don't know why I would have done it deliberately, disingenuously.
[11:41.940 --> 11:44.120]  I think I'm putting my own bullshit on you.
[11:44.340 --> 11:47.160]  Where sometimes when you're talking to someone and you're not listening,
[11:47.440 --> 11:50.700]  you'll make a sound that you think goes with what they're saying.
[11:50.860 --> 11:53.820]  So it seems like you're still there, but you're really not.
[11:53.920 --> 11:56.260]  But you're just throwing a word out there.
[11:56.560 --> 12:00.180]  That's what both of your reactions sounded like in my head at that time.
[12:00.620 --> 12:02.040]  So I'm going to play. I don't know if it'll go through.
[12:02.140 --> 12:04.700]  We'll see on the Discord audio if it will work.
[12:05.380 --> 12:05.980]  Here we go.
[12:06.620 --> 12:07.480]  If it will play.
[12:07.760 --> 12:08.020]  Oh.
[12:08.920 --> 12:09.500]  Oh no.
[12:12.980 --> 12:14.500]  I'll do it one more time.
[12:17.940 --> 12:18.680]  Oh no.
[12:19.320 --> 12:22.520]  Alright, well, okay. In fairness, if I was like...
[12:22.520 --> 12:25.000]  You know, they'd be terrible takes if I was voice acting.
[12:25.160 --> 12:26.820]  Someone would probably say, do that again.
[12:27.060 --> 12:31.040]  But in reality, I'm just... I don't think... I think that's real.
[12:31.600 --> 12:33.340]  I agree. I completely agree.
[12:33.960 --> 12:34.900]  Do you want a redemption?
[12:35.440 --> 12:36.560]  Do you want a redemption moment?
[12:37.100 --> 12:39.380]  No, I already redeemed it last week.
[12:39.600 --> 12:41.620]  I did my replacement over the last week.
[12:43.840 --> 12:48.620]  Hey, Nick, can we get that to broadcast so that it can be added to the FaceBreak shit soundboard?
[12:48.740 --> 12:50.120]  I would like both of those in there, please.
[12:53.220 --> 12:55.660]  You've just deemed them unenthusiastic.
[12:56.160 --> 13:00.780]  By the way, dude, that oh man you just did came across as very genuine.
[13:01.200 --> 13:03.920]  I think both of them were genuine, I would say.
[13:04.020 --> 13:07.880]  I think the oh in my head... It was all completely in my head because I thought I was failing.
[13:07.880 --> 13:10.280]  I didn't even know what you were laughing at at the beginning.
[13:10.660 --> 13:11.480]  At the time.
[13:12.220 --> 13:14.420]  Yeah, no, it wasn't even all that funny.
[13:14.500 --> 13:19.020]  It was just... I was in my own head and it just made me laugh because it seemed so disingenuous.
[13:19.160 --> 13:21.400]  Did you clip out your laugh? Can we listen to that?
[13:21.600 --> 13:22.180]  How ridiculous...
[13:22.180 --> 13:24.160]  Wait one second, I'm getting a phone call right now.
[13:24.480 --> 13:26.840]  Let me see if I can... Can I swap?
[13:27.080 --> 13:28.000]  Well, not... It won't let me swap.
[13:28.200 --> 13:32.860]  So I switched... I made that the noise for all the alerts on my phone.
[13:32.860 --> 13:42.120]  So whenever I get a text, or an email, or a call, I get the oh, oh no, oh...
[13:42.120 --> 13:43.040]  And it just loops.
[13:43.560 --> 13:45.540]  And it has been very funny.
[13:46.320 --> 13:49.240]  I would say, Gavin, that your oh...
[13:50.420 --> 13:54.060]  I would say that that oh and that oh no were exactly...
[13:54.580 --> 13:56.460]  And I'm not weighing in judgment either way.
[13:56.520 --> 14:00.900]  I'm just saying they were exactly as legitimate as your overkill achievement.
[14:01.960 --> 14:02.360]  Alright.
[14:02.860 --> 14:04.900]  So it's real then. It was very legitimate.
[14:05.240 --> 14:08.280]  If you believe in the overkill achievement, then you probably believe in the oh, oh no.
[14:08.540 --> 14:09.680]  I believe in both.
[14:12.040 --> 14:12.440]  Um...
[14:12.440 --> 14:14.360]  It's great. I love...
[14:14.360 --> 14:15.560]  I would rec... Maybe I'll... I don't know.
[14:15.660 --> 14:17.680]  Put the file out if people want to do what I did.
[14:17.760 --> 14:19.500]  It's amazing when things chain.
[14:19.860 --> 14:25.100]  Like if I get a Twitter alert, and then an email comes through, it'll just go oh, oh...
[14:26.600 --> 14:27.400]  It's fantastic.
[14:27.940 --> 14:28.740]  I'm having a great time.
[14:28.740 --> 14:30.900]  It spooked me like three different times.
[14:30.920 --> 14:35.040]  I'll be doing something, and then out of nowhere, I'll just hear Gavin go oh...
[14:35.040 --> 14:35.600]  Oh no.
[14:36.900 --> 14:38.020]  I'd highly recommend.
[14:39.220 --> 14:42.720]  Speaking of Halo, though, for a minute...
[14:42.720 --> 14:44.680]  I had a bit ruined, Geoff.
[14:44.820 --> 14:46.740]  I had something stomped on.
[14:46.780 --> 14:47.680]  It's very sad.
[14:48.940 --> 14:49.400]  What happened?
[14:49.480 --> 14:55.960]  Last time we recorded, it came out that Gavin has been fucking with me with this whole screenshot game.
[14:56.280 --> 14:56.960]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:56.960 --> 14:59.340]  I didn't know it. I finally figured it out.
[14:59.800 --> 15:01.720]  Oh, we haven't done an intro, Eric is saying.
[15:02.220 --> 15:03.700]  Oh yeah, uh, check it out.
[15:03.760 --> 15:05.360]  F*** Face. Episode 80 something.
[15:05.680 --> 15:06.320]  What is it?
[15:06.600 --> 15:09.200]  Who cares?
[15:09.480 --> 15:10.380]  Season 4 or something. Let's go.
[15:11.360 --> 15:13.000]  So I was saying...
[15:14.700 --> 15:15.100]  That...
[15:15.100 --> 15:17.100]  I see that Eric at three, by the way.
[15:17.600 --> 15:20.980]  Also, he's written no intro down here, but at the top he wrote no intro.
[15:21.240 --> 15:23.260]  And then a minute later writes someone do an intro.
[15:24.340 --> 15:25.500]  I didn't see any of that.
[15:25.500 --> 15:27.300]  I wasn't looking at the Discord.
[15:27.720 --> 15:28.700]  So I learned...
[15:28.700 --> 15:32.160]  I learned that Gavin had been fucking with me with the screenshot thing.
[15:32.360 --> 15:44.100]  But what Gavin didn't know is that there's an achievement in Halo Infinite to revive three players in a game type that hasn't been in Halo until this event that just came out.
[15:44.140 --> 15:45.980]  And it's been impossible.
[15:46.100 --> 15:47.640]  The achievement, you couldn't get it until this event.
[15:47.800 --> 15:49.920]  And I got a text from Gavin saying,
[15:50.000 --> 15:50.900]  Hey, did you get the achievement?
[15:51.220 --> 15:53.140]  And I didn't because you can't.
[15:53.140 --> 15:54.740]  It's a different game type.
[15:54.880 --> 15:57.480]  You can revive people in the game type, but it's called...
[15:58.220 --> 15:58.600]  What is it?
[15:58.660 --> 16:00.360]  Like Attrition instead of Elimination?
[16:00.660 --> 16:01.800]  Yeah, because Attrition...
[16:01.800 --> 16:05.400]  At the end of each round of Attrition, it basically ends through Elimination.
[16:05.540 --> 16:10.740]  There's a set amount of lives and then you eliminate the final spawns until everyone's dead.
[16:10.940 --> 16:13.100]  And it even says Elimination on the screen.
[16:13.200 --> 16:13.480]  Yes.
[16:13.520 --> 16:14.500]  So I assumed...
[16:14.500 --> 16:16.160]  And you can revive.
[16:16.340 --> 16:20.340]  So I assumed three revivals in a round would be the achievement.
[16:20.340 --> 16:25.120]  So I assumed that when I played and I couldn't figure out why it didn't unlock when I did it.
[16:25.160 --> 16:28.160]  And I played several games that were very intense trying to get this achievement.
[16:28.340 --> 16:30.500]  And I thought I met the criteria to unlock it.
[16:30.960 --> 16:33.020]  And then I read online, oh, it's the wrong game type.
[16:33.280 --> 16:34.660]  It's Attrition, not Elimination.
[16:34.820 --> 16:36.080]  It's a weird technicality thing.
[16:36.520 --> 16:38.900]  So then when Gavin texted me, have you got the achievement yet?
[16:39.300 --> 16:40.940]  I immediately replied yes.
[16:41.180 --> 16:42.680]  And I thought, I don't know...
[16:42.680 --> 16:44.780]  I don't know what the end result of this will be.
[16:44.840 --> 16:46.380]  But I can just fuck with him about this.
[16:46.420 --> 16:49.920]  And I'm hoping in my head that he's going to be in all these tense games where...
[16:49.920 --> 16:52.700]  He just needs one more revive and he doesn't quite get it.
[16:52.760 --> 16:53.800]  So he's annoyed by it.
[16:54.160 --> 16:55.180]  It just made me laugh.
[16:55.280 --> 16:58.020]  I was. I had so many games where I got two.
[16:58.160 --> 17:00.220]  And I kept being like, oh, it's so close.
[17:02.160 --> 17:04.080]  So we were playing.
[17:04.780 --> 17:08.340]  And it's a lie that I never considered reaching beyond Gavin.
[17:08.920 --> 17:11.720]  And so it was Gavin, Dan, and Bernie joined.
[17:12.340 --> 17:15.720]  And he immediately asked if anyone here had the achievement.
[17:16.420 --> 17:18.120]  And in my head I panicked.
[17:18.120 --> 17:20.780]  I was like, I need to lie about this.
[17:21.300 --> 17:22.380]  So I just said, yeah, I got it.
[17:22.800 --> 17:25.980]  And then I thought, I can message later or something and explain.
[17:26.440 --> 17:28.320]  Because if he then doesn't get it...
[17:29.500 --> 17:32.620]  I then just look like a really weird liar for no reason.
[17:32.760 --> 17:35.240]  So I need to explain that this is a bit dumb doing.
[17:35.400 --> 17:36.780]  So I was like, yeah, I got it.
[17:37.160 --> 17:38.180]  He's like, wow, that's impressive.
[17:38.420 --> 17:39.660]  And we played for a little bit more.
[17:39.780 --> 17:40.840]  And then he left.
[17:41.080 --> 17:41.760]  And we were playing.
[17:42.400 --> 17:45.780]  And like ten minutes after he left, he rejoined the party.
[17:46.200 --> 17:48.400]  And it was like somebody kicked the door down.
[17:48.520 --> 17:50.460]  He rejoined and immediately said,
[17:50.740 --> 17:52.540]  Panton, you said you got that achievement?
[17:53.660 --> 17:56.460]  I was so caught off guard.
[17:56.840 --> 17:57.760]  And I didn't know what to say.
[17:57.960 --> 18:00.380]  So I was like, yes, I did say it, but no.
[18:00.720 --> 18:02.620]  Yes, but no, but yes, but no.
[18:03.440 --> 18:04.240]  But yes.
[18:04.620 --> 18:07.460]  Because he was just in a game and he got three revives.
[18:07.940 --> 18:09.580]  He had just done the criterion.
[18:09.720 --> 18:10.640]  It didn't pop for him.
[18:10.940 --> 18:11.840]  So he was pissed.
[18:12.000 --> 18:13.720]  And he was like, did it fuck me over type thing?
[18:13.720 --> 18:16.320]  And then he didn't know how to interpret my response.
[18:16.760 --> 18:17.980]  So then it just came out
[18:17.980 --> 18:19.540]  that I had been lying to Gavin
[18:19.540 --> 18:22.220]  about this for at least a week.
[18:22.660 --> 18:23.960]  You should have just fucking texted him
[18:23.960 --> 18:26.460]  immediately and said, dude, x-nay on the achievement A.
[18:26.500 --> 18:28.080]  I would have.
[18:28.540 --> 18:29.980]  But I was so panicked
[18:29.980 --> 18:31.620]  the way he came into the party.
[18:31.740 --> 18:33.120]  It was like he kicked the door down.
[18:33.300 --> 18:34.700]  I know that, Bernie.
[18:34.840 --> 18:37.820]  I was not prepared
[18:37.820 --> 18:39.460]  for that to play out.
[18:39.840 --> 18:42.000]  The good news is that there's one other
[18:42.000 --> 18:43.820]  lie that I've told Gavin about Halo
[18:43.820 --> 18:46.020]  that he thinks is true and he doesn't know what it is.
[18:46.220 --> 18:46.800]  He's freaking Geoffed me.
[18:46.900 --> 18:49.220]  He's bloody driver's licensed me here.
[18:50.000 --> 18:51.380]  And I can't figure it out.
[18:51.400 --> 18:53.620]  I'm trying to now remember all the things he's told me about Halo.
[18:54.540 --> 18:56.100]  Is it a good one, Andrew?
[18:56.420 --> 18:57.940]  I remember telling him
[18:57.940 --> 18:58.380]  that.
[18:58.460 --> 19:01.440]  I remember telling him that and him replying,
[19:01.580 --> 19:02.380]  that's interesting.
[19:03.420 --> 19:05.520]  I think it is.
[19:06.060 --> 19:08.360]  It was over text and I said, that's interesting?
[19:09.020 --> 19:10.500]  I'm not going to give you any clues
[19:10.500 --> 19:12.140]  as to what it was.
[19:12.560 --> 19:14.600]  Interesting. Search all.
[19:16.000 --> 19:16.400]  Oh wow.
[19:16.480 --> 19:18.060]  We say interesting to each other a lot.
[19:22.390 --> 19:24.330]  It was funny though when he had to come clean
[19:24.330 --> 19:25.410]  in front of Bernie because
[19:25.870 --> 19:27.750]  he was like, wait, what?
[19:27.830 --> 19:29.370]  And I was like, wait, what?
[19:29.650 --> 19:31.250]  And you just were flummoxed.
[19:32.970 --> 19:34.110]  And Dan was like,
[19:34.150 --> 19:35.130]  I don't know, what's going on?
[19:36.550 --> 19:38.230]  It was very, it was a
[19:38.230 --> 19:39.990]  strangely heated intense moment
[19:39.990 --> 19:42.250]  that came out of left field. But I was disappointed
[19:42.250 --> 19:44.210]  that that bit has died.
[19:44.770 --> 19:46.250]  But I still got one
[19:46.250 --> 19:48.250]  in the fire. I still got one Halo thing
[19:48.250 --> 19:49.430]  that you just don't know what it is.
[19:49.850 --> 19:51.350]  If you ever guess it, I'll let you know.
[19:51.890 --> 19:54.010]  You said interesting to
[19:54.010 --> 19:55.590]  I went bowling the day before.
[19:56.370 --> 19:58.210]  That was when I was doing my
[19:58.210 --> 19:59.910]  investigation on your
[19:59.910 --> 20:01.830]  Halo thing. I asked what you did on
[20:01.830 --> 20:04.230]  that day. And you're like, I can't say on that
[20:04.230 --> 20:05.930]  day, but I went bowling the day before.
[20:06.530 --> 20:07.850]  So that was a joke interesting.
[20:07.850 --> 20:09.370]  Like that actually meant something.
[20:09.990 --> 20:11.970]  I sent you my overkill
[20:11.970 --> 20:13.830]  achievement. I said it might be the worst
[20:13.830 --> 20:15.530]  quality video on YouTube.
[20:15.830 --> 20:17.730]  I must have been 20 when I made this. You said
[20:17.730 --> 20:19.690]  interesting. I said, what do you think?
[20:19.730 --> 20:21.570]  You said I'm holding my opinion till Thursday.
[20:21.730 --> 20:23.810]  I said interesting. That was two interestings
[20:23.810 --> 20:25.790]  across four messages. I'm
[20:25.790 --> 20:27.110]  never gonna find this.
[20:27.730 --> 20:29.710]  If we did a coin flip
[20:29.710 --> 20:31.850]  where one of us had to remove the word interesting
[20:31.850 --> 20:33.930]  I just don't think we'd have text conversations anymore.
[20:34.370 --> 20:35.850]  Maybe we just need to be more
[20:35.850 --> 20:37.690]  honest about what is and isn't interesting.
[20:38.230 --> 20:40.130]  Or increase the bar of what
[20:40.130 --> 20:41.970]  is. Because I feel
[20:41.970 --> 20:44.010]  as though that was a joke interesting
[20:44.010 --> 20:45.970]  but I don't feel like I've ever lied about it
[20:45.970 --> 20:48.030]  interesting. And interesting isn't a lie word
[20:48.030 --> 20:49.930]  for me. What about incredible?
[20:51.110 --> 20:51.590]  Incredible
[20:52.310 --> 20:54.070]  might be a great lie
[20:54.070 --> 20:56.230]  word. Gavin called me out on this. Great question
[20:56.230 --> 20:57.710]  is a great lie word for me.
[20:58.010 --> 20:59.950]  Great question is like that's
[20:59.950 --> 21:01.770]  what I say when I need time to like
[21:01.770 --> 21:03.750]  figure out. It's like a slightly longer
[21:03.750 --> 21:06.190]  It's like I'm gonna respond without responding
[21:06.190 --> 21:07.990]  give me a second to come up with a thought
[21:07.990 --> 21:10.010]  for answering your question.
[21:10.390 --> 21:11.830]  Okay. That's my
[21:11.830 --> 21:13.990]  I don't know, do you have one? Everything I've
[21:13.990 --> 21:14.890]  ever said to you is a lie.
[21:18.270 --> 21:19.830]  I have such a loose
[21:19.830 --> 21:21.170]  relationship with the truth
[21:22.850 --> 21:23.890]  The truth is
[21:23.890 --> 21:25.790]  whatever is the funniest
[21:25.790 --> 21:27.950]  in the moment in whatever content I'm making
[21:29.710 --> 21:30.830]  I love that.
[21:33.130 --> 21:33.570]  Embellishments.
[21:34.110 --> 21:36.150]  Yeah, that's gonna really piss me off
[21:36.150 --> 21:37.070]  probably for the rest of
[21:37.830 --> 21:39.570]  Are you ever gonna tell me though?
[21:40.370 --> 21:42.170]  No, if you guess it
[21:42.170 --> 21:44.130]  I will let you know but I don't think I'll ever tell you
[21:44.130 --> 21:46.250]  Let's just say this
[21:46.250 --> 21:47.510]  Andrew. I've been stormed
[21:48.710 --> 21:50.070]  If my relationship
[21:50.070 --> 21:50.750]  with the truth
[21:52.210 --> 21:54.450]  If I were Macho Man Randy Savage
[21:54.450 --> 21:56.030]  I would be sitting on my sofa right now
[21:56.030 --> 21:58.290]  watching QVC going OH YEAH
[21:58.290 --> 22:00.010]  CUBIC ZIRCONIUM
[22:00.010 --> 22:01.230]  I would be full
[22:01.230 --> 22:04.070]  I can't take the hat off
[22:07.370 --> 22:10.250]  I just like imagining you watching
[22:10.250 --> 22:12.310]  QVC, just generally speaking
[22:12.310 --> 22:13.090]  Dude, I fuckin
[22:13.090 --> 22:15.990]  I like to watch the dudes that sell knives
[22:15.990 --> 22:17.150]  at like 3 in the morning
[22:17.150 --> 22:19.170]  What is their angle?
[22:19.890 --> 22:22.050]  It's like fuckin country dudes
[22:23.030 --> 22:24.230]  There's like a million
[22:24.230 --> 22:25.850]  different QVC type things
[22:25.850 --> 22:27.790]  but I always see the one when I'm in hotels and shit
[22:27.790 --> 22:30.210]  where there's like a lucite
[22:30.210 --> 22:31.830]  lazy susan type thing
[22:31.830 --> 22:33.730]  in the middle and it just spins with like a different
[22:33.730 --> 22:34.970]  buckhunter knife on it
[22:34.970 --> 22:36.870]  and it'll be like a different kind of knife
[22:36.870 --> 22:38.970]  and they'll just talk about how great the knife is
[22:38.970 --> 22:40.470]  I could watch that forever
[22:40.930 --> 22:43.850]  My favorite one, I like whenever they do tech stuff
[22:43.850 --> 22:46.310]  I don't remember what exactly the specifics
[22:46.310 --> 22:48.230]  of it, they tried to sell Xboxes
[22:48.230 --> 22:49.310]  on QVC
[22:49.310 --> 22:51.910]  and them trying to explain why an Xbox One
[22:51.910 --> 22:53.450]  was great, was fantastic
[22:53.450 --> 22:55.870]  There should be like just a channel
[22:55.870 --> 22:57.590]  Do they post all those online?
[22:58.290 --> 22:59.050]  That's a great question
[22:59.050 --> 23:00.970]  They should do that
[23:00.970 --> 23:03.090]  I guess it's not in their best interest
[23:03.090 --> 23:05.930]  I've been watching more of that kind of content
[23:05.930 --> 23:07.050]  for the last few months
[23:07.430 --> 23:09.050]  just for like osmosis purposes
[23:09.490 --> 23:10.730]  we're gonna launch
[23:11.490 --> 23:13.450]  at some point when Gavin's available
[23:13.450 --> 23:14.810]  we're gonna film this
[23:14.810 --> 23:16.210]  we're gonna film that show
[23:17.470 --> 23:18.610]  it's called Does It Do?
[23:18.750 --> 23:21.170]  but anyway we're gonna film that show where we test out
[23:21.170 --> 23:22.150]  infomercial products
[23:22.150 --> 23:23.690]  and so I'm trying to
[23:23.690 --> 23:26.630]  steep myself in that world
[23:26.630 --> 23:29.110]  so I have those kinds of shows on a lot
[23:29.110 --> 23:29.470]  these days
[23:29.470 --> 23:33.010]  I immediately tried to do the same thing
[23:33.010 --> 23:34.370]  we're just watching paid programming
[23:34.370 --> 23:36.350]  but unfortunately almost everything I get
[23:36.350 --> 23:37.710]  is this one guy
[23:38.730 --> 23:40.690]  who tries to sell
[23:41.230 --> 23:43.230]  it's like the bible of business
[23:43.230 --> 23:43.810]  advice
[23:43.810 --> 23:47.170]  he uses the background like it's a church set up
[23:47.170 --> 23:48.870]  but it's just like this is a book
[23:48.870 --> 23:56.010]  On how to be successful in business and it sucks. It's a terrible like one hour long, maybe 30 minutes
[23:56.010 --> 24:00.250]  I don't know. But anyway, terrible. I don't have fun ones. I wish I had knife guys
[24:00.250 --> 24:04.670]  I'd love to watch somebody try to sell me on a knife because I feel like it's an easy sell
[24:04.670 --> 24:10.070]  You're not really looking for too many things out of a knife. I uh, yeah, it's like does it stab good?
[24:11.030 --> 24:16.950]  I uh, I'll send you some I'll send you some knife content. Please do. I'd love some good knife content. Absolutely
[24:17.510 --> 24:19.310]  Why are why are knives better?
[24:19.910 --> 24:26.010]  Well, what do you mean by that? Like isn't there a metal we can make knives out of where it doesn't go blunt over time?
[24:26.190 --> 24:31.750]  Like should a chicken really blunt my knife if I if I cut a hundred chickens up? I don't hmm
[24:32.350 --> 24:37.830]  Well, there are like Japanese knives. Those are really high quality, but even those go dull. Still gotta be sharpened.
[24:37.850 --> 24:39.290]  Still have to be sharpened
[24:39.290 --> 24:40.870]  Japanese knives are cool
[24:41.430 --> 24:43.350]  But a knife that never dulls
[24:44.270 --> 24:46.610]  Yeah, what's the most resilient metal?
[24:48.750 --> 24:49.310]  What?
[24:50.030 --> 24:51.870]  What is the most, Google?
[24:52.830 --> 24:57.790]  I don't know. Is the most resilient metal. Has to feel good though as well
[24:57.790 --> 25:02.530]  I can't I would rather take a knife that dulls but feels good to use than a chromium
[25:03.350 --> 25:03.910]  chromium
[25:04.910 --> 25:06.010]  chromium knife
[25:06.550 --> 25:08.630]  Do they sell this? Yeah
[25:09.150 --> 25:13.770]  Chromium knife blades. Oh, they you can buy a ham acker slam acker
[25:14.430 --> 25:14.990]  for
[25:15.730 --> 25:22.490]  $154.95 the forever sharp French chef's knife kitchen knife. Dude, we can get some chromium
[25:22.490 --> 25:26.210]  I got a chromium chisel. Have you ever had to sharpen it?
[25:26.930 --> 25:30.250]  No, I only used it a week ago to put in a new
[25:31.650 --> 25:32.890]  Electric door handle
[25:47.770 --> 25:49.550]  What a great throwback
[25:50.290 --> 25:53.350]  Yeah, that was a great great callback, buddy
[25:55.050 --> 26:00.810]  I'm gonna take notes on that as somebody who killed it with a callback recently of the bread clip
[26:00.810 --> 26:07.830]  I'm gonna take notes on on great callback execution. That was perfect. But you just totally nailed you rolled with it. It was amazing
[26:07.830 --> 26:12.130]  I don't know why I've said it because it doesn't make sense. I feel like you I
[26:12.850 --> 26:14.810]  Think you may have said the batteries
[26:14.810 --> 26:18.790]  I think you may have used the word expired which then made me think of
[26:19.590 --> 26:23.810]  Food expiring which then made me think of the purpose of a bread clip. Well, that is funny
[26:23.810 --> 26:28.550]  Did you did I say it like 90 seconds earlier there because it seemed to come out of nowhere
[26:28.550 --> 26:29.070]  No
[26:29.070 --> 26:30.870]  I wish there was there was something
[26:31.310 --> 26:36.290]  recently that on the podcast where I thought I had a really funny line and I didn't say it and there's nothing funnier on a
[26:36.290 --> 26:40.530]  Podcast and talking about something funny you could have said but didn't this is great
[26:42.750 --> 26:48.810]  Let me enthrall you with is that the right word that was the right word right and yeah nailed it I nailed it
[26:48.810 --> 26:53.570]  Yeah, that was good. It's a good moment by me. I have I have moments where I
[26:54.770 --> 27:00.750]  Listening back to the podcast. I can see areas where I was about to tell a joke and I just don't but sometime
[27:00.750 --> 27:04.570]  But because I you can hear me go like and I'm when I'm listening to it
[27:04.570 --> 27:08.270]  I'm like, oh, I know I was gonna say that um, you know, that could have been funny, but I didn't say it
[27:08.270 --> 27:10.110]  But there are some times where I just leave
[27:10.790 --> 27:16.230]  The setups in and then don't and then I that I give up on it and don't deliver the punchline
[27:16.730 --> 27:20.790]  But there was a bit in when Geoff was talking about his bikes and his exploding batteries
[27:20.790 --> 27:21.170]  Uh-huh
[27:21.170 --> 27:26.670]  He was talking about the spokes and I was and I said something like oh, were they custom?
[27:26.930 --> 27:30.330]  And what I was gonna say was you could say it was bespoke
[27:30.330 --> 27:34.230]  But I I just left in that is it a custom thing and I never did the punchline
[27:35.330 --> 27:37.310]  Because I just thought better of it
[27:38.170 --> 27:40.930]  And you would never know what I was about to say has
[27:40.930 --> 27:46.250]  Has there ever been a one where you tried to guide the car back to the ramp on a future episode?
[27:46.790 --> 27:50.350]  Did you ever have you ever tried to take us back because you thought a line was so good
[27:50.770 --> 27:52.270]  But you need to show it again
[27:52.850 --> 27:56.990]  You gotta run this back. Have you done that? I haven't done that. I have more
[27:58.210 --> 28:03.050]  Like I'll have an idea of something to talk about and then it just never comes up and then I question
[28:03.050 --> 28:07.170]  Should I still talk about it? Cuz I think it's funny, but it doesn't make sense
[28:07.170 --> 28:12.370]  It's been so long since the main thing like so oh boy
[28:12.850 --> 28:17.750]  We're going to a lot of places here. So on the RT podcast at one point. It was brought up recently
[28:17.750 --> 28:19.670]  it'd be funny too because we have a
[28:20.190 --> 28:26.410]  on the next episode of Jack does at the end of these where he guesses what will happen and it was joked about that what
[28:26.410 --> 28:32.710]  If we did a previously on at the start of the episode and so I thought that's a funny idea
[28:33.210 --> 28:37.430]  What if like I could get some weird person to do the previously on
[28:37.430 --> 28:42.570]  That no one would be able to know like it would become a mystery of who is the previously on
[28:42.570 --> 28:47.790]  Because I loved lost and that was like a weird thing for a while with loss where people like who the fuck is the previously
[28:47.790 --> 28:50.950]  And lost voice and they kind of like kept it a mystery. So it's like hmm
[28:50.950 --> 28:55.230]  What would be a funny nobody would be able to guess who is this voice?
[28:55.490 --> 28:58.830]  And so I reached out to the guy that wrote that variety article
[29:02.830 --> 29:03.910]  It's like hey
[29:05.130 --> 29:11.690]  I asked you something and I did not approach it and we talked very nice. Todd's great. Todd's a great guy
[29:11.690 --> 29:17.110]  He politely declined in doing the previously on which is why I'm bringing up now
[29:17.110 --> 29:22.170]  But that is something all in the last two we recorded was constantly in my head of like I want to talk about the fact
[29:22.170 --> 29:28.550]  That I talked to the guy that wrote that variety article and never got how he explained himself. Yeah explain himself
[29:29.050 --> 29:31.830]  No, I didn't ask that. I didn't ask why we weren't included
[29:31.830 --> 29:33.290]  I just I brought up
[29:34.310 --> 29:39.350]  What's the point? No, I don't really care why I don't fuck if variety includes this or not
[29:39.350 --> 29:42.050]  It doesn't matter in any way to me that aspect of it
[29:42.050 --> 29:45.990]  I just that what was funny to me about the variety thing as I said was the fact that they
[29:45.990 --> 29:50.610]  Do you would assume they would have to at least consider it? There'd be some form
[29:50.610 --> 29:53.970]  That's what it'd be good to know like was he not provided the list?
[29:54.170 --> 29:58.670]  Was it someone in our company who didn't give it to him or was it he had it and didn't want to include it?
[29:58.910 --> 30:00.850]  I don't care about that information
[30:00.850 --> 30:07.530]  You do care you talked about how funny it was how you loved the idea that at some point he had to sit down and make
[30:07.530 --> 30:11.570]  A decision what to include and what not to and what would be safe for variety or not?
[30:11.750 --> 30:18.730]  And and you had the man who had to make those decisions on the hook and you didn't ask him about those decisions
[30:18.730 --> 30:23.930]  That was the whole point of all of this. You don't make any sense. No, I
[30:25.050 --> 30:30.670]  You talk to anyone else I'm disappointed. No, here's let me explain myself
[30:30.850 --> 30:34.570]  If I get an answer to that question, it might no longer be funny anymore
[30:34.570 --> 30:37.330]  If I just assume what happened, it's funny
[30:37.330 --> 30:40.810]  If I continue to live in the world in which my assumption is correct
[30:40.810 --> 30:47.790]  It's funny to me and there's no risk of that changing. I don't really care that we weren't mentioned in the variety thing
[30:47.790 --> 30:50.590]  I don't give a fuck about what variety thinks of this podcast
[30:51.450 --> 30:56.410]  Doesn't matter to me. What's funny to me? Is that proper likes established businesses?
[30:57.030 --> 31:03.050]  That don't have that tone at all have to at least look at the name theoretically and then decide if they want to include it
[31:03.050 --> 31:09.210]  I don't asking I don't need confirmation for that. That's just I'm deciding that's how that goes. I didn't care about that
[31:09.210 --> 31:15.250]  I just thought it'd be really because nobody would fucking guess was the variety guy doing the previously on that would have been a great
[31:15.250 --> 31:18.970]  Yeah, of course, I wouldn't would have been a fantastic yet
[31:18.970 --> 31:24.770]  So now I'm trying to think of somebody kind of tied to the show. That is Jackie Chan. I don't think
[31:27.070 --> 31:31.970]  I don't think Kevin Donovan would vouch for me. Unfortunately at this time, so I don't
[31:32.710 --> 31:36.570]  That'd be a tough one. Dusty Baker. I
[31:36.570 --> 31:39.690]  Thought about trying to get somebody in the Zimmer family
[31:39.690 --> 31:43.530]  But then I thought I don't know how they'd feel about the boys the Zimmer shirts and all that
[31:43.530 --> 31:48.370]  I don't know necessarily if they'd love yeah, I'd hope they would but I just don't know
[31:48.370 --> 31:53.050]  Yeah, and a lot of us laughing at their dead relative getting shoved into the ground headfirst
[31:53.890 --> 31:55.530]  That's I kind of forgot about
[31:55.530 --> 32:03.110]  Yeah, maybe not the greatest idea it was interesting I was reading about I don't know if you know about this Geoff
[32:03.110 --> 32:07.890]  I didn't know a lot about Don Zimmer's time with the Texans, which is when he was on that
[32:07.890 --> 32:12.030]  That's when he ate the fried chicken. Yeah, the 1982 guys was reading about it
[32:12.030 --> 32:17.630]  I don't are you familiar with what happened to him when he was on that team? No, I was fired on him
[32:17.630 --> 32:22.370]  He was fired on like Monday and asked to manage the team through to Thursday
[32:23.050 --> 32:25.930]  But they fired him on Monday and they had him they had him like
[32:26.530 --> 32:30.370]  Manage a game beyond being told that he was gonna get fired at the end of the week
[32:30.370 --> 32:35.230]  Something happened that nobody knows what like five days prior to him getting fired
[32:35.230 --> 32:37.850]  The owner said I think Zimmer is doing a great job
[32:37.850 --> 32:43.350]  And then he had an all-day meeting and from what I can tell the owner has never said Zimmer never said what happened
[32:43.350 --> 32:44.970]  But something happened and he fired
[32:45.630 --> 32:51.130]  Immediately after they had some disagreement that has never become public and so he fired him on a Monday
[32:52.110 --> 32:56.030]  And they had a press conference post all this coming out.
[32:56.410 --> 33:01.690]  And somebody asked... I wish there was audio or video of this. It's such a contentious press conference.
[33:01.870 --> 33:04.930]  Where it's the owner and Zimmer. And somebody asked the owner,
[33:05.570 --> 33:09.190]  Can Don Zimmer have a job in a different part of the Texans organization?
[33:09.550 --> 33:12.750]  And the owner said, absolutely. Don Zimmer is this beloved man in baseball.
[33:13.290 --> 33:18.090]  He's great. Fantastic. He can have any job in this building that he wants.
[33:18.090 --> 33:20.210]  To which Don Zimmer then replies,
[33:20.390 --> 33:25.310]  What I want is to manage the team on Friday when they play against the Yankees.
[33:25.390 --> 33:26.410]  That's what I would like.
[33:26.810 --> 33:29.190]  And the owner looks at him and then says to the media,
[33:29.790 --> 33:32.330]  Don is going to be playing golf on Friday instead.
[33:32.510 --> 33:34.130]  It's been a very stressful time.
[33:34.390 --> 33:38.750]  But, you know, I think we all think it's in his best interest to just relax and play some golf.
[33:39.150 --> 33:41.910]  To which then Don doubles down and says,
[33:41.950 --> 33:43.930]  No, I don't want to play golf.
[33:43.930 --> 33:48.270]  I want to manage the team on Friday against the Yankees.
[33:48.330 --> 33:50.030]  But it appears I'll be playing golf.
[33:50.390 --> 33:55.310]  It's great. I just love that they had this insane press conference where he's arguing with the owner.
[33:55.450 --> 33:56.470]  What's going on there?
[33:56.510 --> 33:58.330]  I don't know. It's a wild time.
[33:58.450 --> 34:00.930]  They seem like a dumpster of a franchise at that time.
[34:01.270 --> 34:04.130]  But it was wild getting into some Don Zimmer. So I don't know.
[34:04.950 --> 34:07.910]  Oh, Gavin just posted a screenshot. Interesting.
[34:10.690 --> 34:12.930]  Nick said we should ask Pedro Martinez.
[34:12.930 --> 34:14.330]  I think that's a great idea.
[34:14.450 --> 34:16.090]  He is out and available.
[34:16.670 --> 34:18.430]  He's doing MLB commentary.
[34:18.870 --> 34:20.470]  He's used to recording.
[34:20.670 --> 34:24.150]  I bet he'd be super willing and available to do it.
[34:24.150 --> 34:26.550]  Who do you think is more likely, Pedro Martinez or Coolio?
[34:28.030 --> 34:33.290]  Well, we've been more pro-Pedro Martinez than we have been Coolio.
[34:33.410 --> 34:37.690]  I feel like we early on signaled that we were coming for him.
[34:38.630 --> 34:40.890]  That's true. I forgot about that.
[34:40.890 --> 34:46.710]  If Coolio did the previously on, he could end his previously on and just say, here it goes.
[34:47.990 --> 34:48.630]  That's true.
[34:49.210 --> 34:50.450]  Is that a Coolio song?
[34:50.910 --> 34:53.390]  It's just the end of the... well, it's the beginning of Kino and Co, isn't it?
[34:53.670 --> 34:54.430]  Oh, here it goes.
[34:55.010 --> 34:55.450]  Oh.
[34:56.830 --> 35:03.690]  For a thing that we've talked about like eight times, I have no concept, I have no memory of any of the Coolio rap lines outside of...
[35:03.690 --> 35:05.310]  Abbott and Costello were mentioned?
[35:07.010 --> 35:11.410]  And that might be it. I think that's all I remember about the Coolio rap.
[35:12.070 --> 35:16.130]  I mean, it was a Kel quote, wasn't it? From the show. Nobody watched it. I don't know why I'm asking.
[35:17.130 --> 35:17.890]  I watched it.
[35:18.070 --> 35:21.490]  I think I've seen every single episode of Keaton and Kel multiple times.
[35:21.610 --> 35:26.950]  I bet we could get Kel. I met him once. He's really, really nice and seems up for it.
[35:26.970 --> 35:27.350]  You met both of them?
[35:28.070 --> 35:32.130]  Oh, I guess I did. Not at the same time, though. Years apart. But I did meet Kel first and he seemed lovely.
[35:32.130 --> 35:36.850]  I was so baffled that that was a question, Gavin, that I didn't register it as a question.
[35:37.190 --> 35:40.730]  I thought you were like talking, uh, when you asked about Keaton and Kel.
[35:41.030 --> 35:46.670]  Like, it was such an absurd idea to me that you would ask either of us after the history of the rap.
[35:47.250 --> 35:48.090]  What did I ask?
[35:48.390 --> 35:52.690]  Didn't you? No, we're not doing this again. Didn't you just phrase a question?
[35:52.950 --> 35:59.950]  You said, isn't it a Keaton and Kel thing? We're talking about Keaton and Kel and you brought up, isn't it a line from the show?
[36:00.490 --> 36:07.870]  And then you said, that's a perfect example of the moment had gone past. I shouldn't have returned to it because you had left the building.
[36:08.390 --> 36:13.950]  Well, it was too far. It was too far enough for me to remember what question you were talking about. And then when I said what question, you didn't...
[36:14.490 --> 36:23.310]  Well, because I don't... Keaton and Kel does not stick in my brain. So I was struggling. I was trying to, like, recreate the backdrop of the scenario of where it was asked.
[36:23.730 --> 36:25.890]  The longer we talk about it, the better it gets.
[36:27.650 --> 36:36.590]  Nick, can you clip that moment and then we can submit that to Webster's or Numerium for their audio dictionary to describe that?
[36:37.090 --> 36:41.110]  As the perfect dictionary example of what that moment is.
[36:42.290 --> 36:43.570]  What moment is?
[36:44.510 --> 36:44.810]  Exactly.
[36:46.310 --> 36:47.130]  Thanks, Nick.
[36:49.690 --> 36:55.330]  I learned something else that kind of blew my mind. I feel like most people will probably realize this.
[36:55.330 --> 37:03.330]  I fucked up in kind of a not interesting way. I thought that David Hasselhoff was a part of Blue Swede. That's what I thought.
[37:04.030 --> 37:05.110]  I hooked on a feeling.
[37:05.510 --> 37:05.610]  Band?
[37:06.150 --> 37:09.370]  Yeah. I thought hooked on a feeling was a David Hasselhoff song.
[37:09.750 --> 37:10.230]  Why?
[37:10.850 --> 37:18.650]  Well, because I think he covered it. And it, like, crossed in my brain that he was just the singer of the Blue Swede version.
[37:18.890 --> 37:21.810]  So I just assumed he was in Blue Swede.
[37:21.810 --> 37:28.250]  And so to learn that he doesn't, he's not, and that he has an extensive cover career was fun.
[37:28.790 --> 37:35.670]  But I've lived, I don't know, my whole life thinking that David Hasselhoff, whenever I'd hear hooked on a feeling, I always assumed it was David Hasselhoff.
[37:36.630 --> 37:41.130]  Well, it's because he performed it so well. He owned that performance.
[37:41.510 --> 37:43.030]  I don't think I've heard the Hasselhoff version.
[37:43.030 --> 37:45.850]  Have you not seen the video? You must have seen the video.
[37:46.230 --> 37:48.550]  Oh, we're putting the video in right now.
[37:48.870 --> 37:52.930]  I know this is an audio podcast. We will describe what is happening.
[37:53.090 --> 37:58.130]  That is what, I went on a whole binge of Hasselhoff's music videos after this.
[37:58.450 --> 38:00.130]  One of the greatest videos of all time.
[38:00.730 --> 38:06.170]  It feels very much like Hasselhoff got a green screen and was really excited about it.
[38:06.610 --> 38:07.490]  Alright, I'm like...
[38:07.490 --> 38:11.410]  Get loaded up, you're immediately hooked. You're hooked on a feeling immediately.
[38:13.750 --> 38:17.290]  What are you dealing with? You got the dancing bear? You got this dog?
[38:18.170 --> 38:20.890]  Is he like a yeti flying over the clouds? What's happening here?
[38:20.890 --> 38:23.870]  He's in like an Inuit suit, snowboard or something, right?
[38:25.310 --> 38:30.590]  I like that it's not even like, the background footage isn't even the same aspect ratio.
[38:33.050 --> 38:35.390]  He's standing in a bunch of crushed people.
[38:36.890 --> 38:42.490]  I don't... either David Hasselhoff is a comedic genius or it's one of the greatest accidents of all time.
[38:42.930 --> 38:45.330]  It's the way that the video builds off of itself.
[38:45.510 --> 38:47.410]  It's a very popular video, I'm surprised you haven't seen it.
[38:47.630 --> 38:48.990]  Yeah, I've never... I've missed that.
[38:49.350 --> 38:52.650]  It's a... what is this, a hymn dressed up in safari dancing?
[38:53.170 --> 38:55.590]  Yeah, they must have known this was funny.
[38:56.170 --> 38:58.130]  I don't know. I can't tell.
[38:58.150 --> 38:59.010]  He's singing with himself.
[38:59.290 --> 39:00.630]  He's standing on a bike.
[39:01.950 --> 39:03.470]  Well, he flies on it later.
[39:03.470 --> 39:05.930]  Oh, he's flying. He's flying off the...
[39:05.930 --> 39:07.630]  Yeah, they know what they're doing with this.
[39:07.870 --> 39:10.030]  I feel like they do, but it's great.
[39:10.210 --> 39:11.910]  But it's possible they don't.
[39:12.210 --> 39:14.770]  I mean, I feel like they do, maybe he doesn't.
[39:15.130 --> 39:15.930]  That's what I'm saying.
[39:16.470 --> 39:18.210]  It's kind of a macho man situation.
[39:23.230 --> 39:24.830]  What about you guys? How have you been?
[39:26.170 --> 39:27.330]  Wait, we're back to pleasantries?
[39:27.690 --> 39:30.370]  No, I was just... I feel like I'm talking a lot.
[39:30.450 --> 39:32.230]  I've learned about Hasselhoff and Macho Man.
[39:32.230 --> 39:39.210]  Well, I wanted to talk to you about how serious you are about this Donkey Kong challenge.
[39:39.570 --> 39:41.870]  Oh, okay. I'm very serious about it.
[39:42.170 --> 39:42.830]  When does it begin?
[39:43.330 --> 39:46.270]  That's a great question, because I walked away from that going,
[39:46.410 --> 39:48.210]  I don't know if I ever set a date.
[39:48.350 --> 39:50.730]  What about when this comes out?
[39:50.730 --> 39:53.690]  You said it needed to start on a Saturday after a recording.
[39:54.070 --> 39:54.390]  Okay.
[39:54.470 --> 39:55.490]  Or after when it comes out.
[39:55.670 --> 39:57.450]  This will come out on a Wednesday.
[39:57.930 --> 40:00.930]  This Saturday, I will start the thing.
[40:00.930 --> 40:02.450]  And that's when the 48 hours will clock.
[40:02.710 --> 40:06.130]  40 hours? What was the time? We adjusted the time.
[40:06.650 --> 40:07.370]  44 hours.
[40:07.650 --> 40:08.610]  44 hours.
[40:09.150 --> 40:11.210]  I have to ask a question before we get any further.
[40:11.410 --> 40:11.790]  Of course.
[40:12.050 --> 40:14.990]  You started this response by saying, great question.
[40:15.190 --> 40:17.730]  So am I not to believe you now?
[40:17.950 --> 40:22.230]  Because everything that now is said post a great question is a lie that you've come up with on the moment?
[40:22.650 --> 40:25.650]  No, it's a problem where it's also just kind of my go-to response.
[40:25.870 --> 40:27.490]  I think that was a genuine great question.
[40:28.250 --> 40:29.450]  I didn't need time for that one.
[40:29.450 --> 40:32.130]  That was a genuine great question. I see what you're saying.
[40:32.330 --> 40:35.070]  It is a dilemma. It's a real problem. I'm going to work it out.
[40:35.430 --> 40:36.910]  But that was a great question.
[40:39.390 --> 40:40.770]  FFacepod on Twitch.
[40:41.630 --> 40:42.050]  I think.
[40:42.410 --> 40:43.310]  What day though?
[40:43.690 --> 40:46.830]  Saturday. What day is... when does this come out?
[40:46.890 --> 40:49.050]  What day is the numerical date?
[40:49.470 --> 40:51.850]  This will be on February 16th.
[40:52.190 --> 40:52.670]  February...
[40:52.670 --> 40:53.770]  Did we work this out last time?
[40:53.850 --> 40:54.170]  16.
[40:54.170 --> 40:56.450]  Did we figure out when the last week's one would come out?
[40:56.650 --> 40:57.070]  Maybe.
[40:57.330 --> 40:58.270]  But it already happened.
[40:58.270 --> 40:59.250]  It's now happened.
[40:59.850 --> 41:01.310]  Well, you did this. You did this to us.
[41:01.350 --> 41:02.290]  It's your fault if it has.
[41:03.670 --> 41:05.830]  February 19th will be the start time.
[41:05.950 --> 41:06.750]  12 a.m.
[41:07.210 --> 41:08.450]  It's like a month away.
[41:08.830 --> 41:09.770]  I don't want to wait that long.
[41:10.130 --> 41:11.810]  Well, we've recorded a few for you.
[41:12.050 --> 41:13.990]  This is your fault that you have to wait that long.
[41:14.150 --> 41:15.610]  We're ahead because of you.
[41:17.450 --> 41:18.090]  This is you.
[41:18.370 --> 41:19.290]  You did this.
[41:19.810 --> 41:21.050]  I'm glad you brought that up though.
[41:21.050 --> 41:25.930]  Because I had been thinking that I felt like I don't know when I'm supposed to start this.
[41:26.430 --> 41:28.130]  But it would feel weird for me to bring it up.
[41:28.130 --> 41:29.190]  So we're set.
[41:29.330 --> 41:32.030]  You're good with the 64 pieces of clothing?
[41:32.150 --> 41:32.650]  I'm going to be honest.
[41:32.730 --> 41:35.690]  I didn't know Joey had a bit in Friends where it was that.
[41:36.370 --> 41:37.350]  So I felt a little unlucky.
[41:38.150 --> 41:39.390]  Was it exactly 64 pieces?
[41:39.390 --> 41:41.070]  There's no way it was exactly.
[41:41.150 --> 41:43.410]  It was just he was wearing a lot of clothes for some reason.
[41:43.990 --> 41:47.630]  People have worn a lot of clothes since the beginning of time.
[41:48.530 --> 41:49.830]  Since the beginning of time?
[41:51.450 --> 41:53.910]  Nick wrote something very funny in the chat.
[41:54.630 --> 41:55.810]  If you watch Friends.
[41:57.470 --> 41:58.430]  I didn't.
[41:58.510 --> 41:59.750]  I still thought it was funny.
[41:59.970 --> 42:00.950]  I haven't seen it.
[42:01.210 --> 42:01.690]  I still think.
[42:01.930 --> 42:03.310]  Why didn't you just read the line?
[42:03.390 --> 42:05.410]  Why didn't you say that Nick said something funny?
[42:05.510 --> 42:07.010]  Why didn't you just say what he said?
[42:07.430 --> 42:09.290]  Why are we dissecting every bit?
[42:10.290 --> 42:11.670]  Well, it's just weird.
[42:12.130 --> 42:13.150]  Because that means nothing.
[42:13.390 --> 42:15.210]  Now people don't know what Nick said.
[42:16.610 --> 42:19.010]  It's a weird way to handle that situation.
[42:20.270 --> 42:23.750]  What does Nick deliver in the style of said character?
[42:24.990 --> 42:26.290]  I like this.
[42:28.750 --> 42:30.490]  Nick, I'm gonna need that clipped too.
[42:30.630 --> 42:32.150]  That's gonna go for the soundboard as well.
[42:32.350 --> 42:33.710]  Nick unmuted inside.
[42:34.190 --> 42:34.950]  Yeah, definitely.
[42:35.350 --> 42:37.350]  Could he be wearing any more clothes?
[42:38.110 --> 42:38.550]  That was good.
[42:38.970 --> 42:39.710]  That was great, man.
[42:40.090 --> 42:41.130]  That was really good, Nick.
[42:42.370 --> 42:43.630]  I'd love to hear him do an O.
[42:43.930 --> 42:45.250]  I bet you that would sound just as good.
[42:46.110 --> 42:46.450]  Delivery.
[42:47.570 --> 42:48.690]  I'm not gonna do callbacks.
[42:49.570 --> 42:51.110]  I'm done with callbacks.
[42:51.890 --> 42:52.410]  That was good.
[42:52.410 --> 42:54.350]  I don't think Eric hasn't said very much on this one.
[42:55.270 --> 42:57.170]  I was here for the pleasantries.
[42:57.510 --> 42:59.410]  And then you guys... I'm not featured here.
[42:59.750 --> 43:00.550]  It's all you guys.
[43:00.850 --> 43:02.970]  I will say that Eric came in hot with dates.
[43:03.170 --> 43:07.850]  We were talking about when Macho Man Randy Savage initially retreated from the public eye.
[43:08.570 --> 43:09.790]  Eric was like...
[43:09.790 --> 43:15.090]  The fucking NWA was disincorporated on this exact day.
[43:15.930 --> 43:18.830]  Eric has a timeline of everything that's ever happened to wrestling.
[43:18.830 --> 43:22.330]  He was very beneficial early on.
[43:22.790 --> 43:25.070]  But that's all pleasantries, so I don't know if that made it, Gavin.
[43:33.230 --> 43:37.230]  This ad is brought to you by HelloFresh, America's number one meal kit.

[44:26.550 --> 44:28.250]  And it was just fun, and it was delicious.

[47:22.550 --> 47:24.730]  I've been disowned by every country.
[47:25.270 --> 47:25.410]  What?
[47:25.710 --> 47:29.410]  Well, I meant, this is going to be an Eric question.
[47:30.050 --> 47:34.070]  So, we played Halo a little bit ago, the three of us.
[47:34.430 --> 47:37.630]  No, Geoff and you and myself played some Halo.
[47:37.630 --> 47:39.610]  It's been a minute, I haven't played Halo with you guys in weeks.
[47:39.790 --> 47:43.370]  It's been some time, it took a while to put this together.
[47:44.070 --> 47:53.370]  But we're talking about, let's say that you were created, you exist, and you had to pick a country to live in based only on its flag.
[47:54.370 --> 47:59.390]  You don't know anything about it, the only point of context you have is the flag for the place.
[47:59.850 --> 48:01.190]  What flag would you pick?
[48:01.190 --> 48:06.930]  And then we were making conversation about joke facts for different countries.
[48:07.090 --> 48:11.410]  So I emailed every country what fact they would want.
[48:12.610 --> 48:16.690]  If they could share one fact about their country...
[48:16.690 --> 48:18.470]  Who's answering the country's inbox?
[48:18.870 --> 48:22.750]  I don't know, I didn't get any replies, that's why I'm saying I've been disowned by every country.
[48:22.930 --> 48:26.750]  I emailed every country asking if you could share one fact about...
[48:26.750 --> 48:29.290]  Some countries don't, Nick, that's a great point.
[48:29.290 --> 48:31.410]  He asked, does every country have an email address?
[48:31.670 --> 48:32.790]  Some countries do not.
[48:32.990 --> 48:36.190]  But every country that did, I emailed.
[48:36.730 --> 48:37.570]  What do you mean?
[48:37.630 --> 48:38.510]  What do you mean?
[48:38.510 --> 48:39.010]  What do you mean?
[48:39.110 --> 48:40.370]  How do you email a country?
[48:40.570 --> 48:42.150]  Like the government?
[48:42.730 --> 48:49.870]  You Google the country, and typically there's an official country tourism website that they've made for their own place.
[48:49.930 --> 48:51.270]  You're emailing the tourist board.
[48:51.530 --> 48:54.330]  Yeah, I'm emailing the tourist board for the country.
[48:54.330 --> 48:58.330]  Does that constitute... you could just email, like, Steve...
[48:59.030 --> 49:01.010]  I'm not fucking emailing Travelocity!
[49:01.370 --> 49:04.930]  I'm emailing the country represented tourist website.
[49:06.330 --> 49:08.030]  Have you seen Nick's email address?
[49:10.910 --> 49:11.950]  UnitedStatesOfAmericaAtUSAUSAUSA.gov
[49:13.510 --> 49:19.210]  A lot of places, you don't know their email address, you just put in, like, a contact form, and you reach out to them.
[49:19.210 --> 49:20.370]  I wonder why he got no replies.
[49:20.370 --> 49:26.790]  I didn't get... but I feel like I'm being ghosted by every country at the moment, and I don't feel like I have one.
[49:26.970 --> 49:28.630]  I feel like I'm a man without country.
[49:28.850 --> 49:36.570]  But we all answered that question, so I was going to ask Eric if he was going to pick a country based purely on flag alone, what country would he go with?
[49:38.930 --> 49:39.330]  Albania?
[49:40.390 --> 49:40.790]  Albania?
[49:41.070 --> 49:41.470]  Yeah.
[49:42.470 --> 49:45.310]  Albania? I don't even know what Albania's flag looks like.
[49:45.630 --> 49:46.490]  Oh, you should look it up.
[49:46.870 --> 49:47.630]  Albania flag.
[49:47.630 --> 49:50.450]  Yeah, you could probably just type in the word Albania.
[49:50.770 --> 49:51.630]  I don't...
[49:52.370 --> 49:53.010]  Two-headed bird?
[49:53.290 --> 49:54.070]  Yes, it is.
[49:54.630 --> 49:56.290]  I don't know if I like this.
[49:57.010 --> 49:58.890]  You don't know if you like...
[49:58.890 --> 50:01.730]  It's weird that countries aren't getting back to you, man, that's nuts.
[50:02.050 --> 50:07.590]  No, okay, let me... the Albania flag looks like somebody that you wouldn't want to play a multiplayer game with.
[50:07.890 --> 50:09.990]  Like in a shooter, like that is...
[50:09.990 --> 50:12.030]  Can somebody link the Albanian flag?
[50:12.030 --> 50:13.550]  I can see it.
[50:16.550 --> 50:17.910]  What a great question.
[50:18.630 --> 50:19.910]  Oh, that's a...
[50:20.510 --> 50:21.870]  You wouldn't want to live there, Geoff?
[50:22.530 --> 50:23.510]  Here's... no, dude.
[50:23.650 --> 50:27.170]  You can see... what do you mean? You can see the birds have tongues? You can see their tongues?
[50:27.630 --> 50:28.990]  How often do you see a bird's tongue?
[50:29.450 --> 50:31.890]  That flag... that flag looks like war.
[50:32.210 --> 50:35.290]  That's an aggressive flag. I just want to live...
[50:35.290 --> 50:36.030]  Here's my flag.
[50:36.730 --> 50:37.210]  Kiribati.
[50:37.650 --> 50:38.570]  There's a seagull.
[50:38.930 --> 50:39.790]  There's a white bird.
[50:40.070 --> 50:40.570]  There's sunshine.
[50:41.470 --> 50:44.610]  Dude, my flag says suntan on the beach.
[50:45.650 --> 50:46.870]  Nick's right, it's peaceful.
[50:47.090 --> 50:48.350]  You have a boring-ass bird.
[50:48.570 --> 50:51.710]  My birds have tongues, two heads, going nuts. You're crazy.
[50:52.390 --> 50:56.410]  You're bad. Your flag is a mythical beast with a thousand talents.
[50:56.630 --> 51:01.870]  The person that represents your flag is telling me to uninstall the game because I don't have a high enough KD.
[51:02.130 --> 51:04.730]  Like what... I don't want to live in your nation.
[51:06.070 --> 51:07.030]  It stinks.
[51:07.470 --> 51:08.470]  Geoff's flag is great.
[51:08.470 --> 51:15.430]  If I'm in a game lobby with Geoff's flag, he's playing music too loudly, but it's chill music, so I'm okay with it.
[51:15.590 --> 51:17.830]  He's not doing all that great, but he's...
[51:17.830 --> 51:22.530]  Island vibes, man. I'm having a great time, man. I'm loving life.
[51:22.830 --> 51:25.530]  Is Kiribati... it's Kiribati, I think, isn't it?
[51:25.690 --> 51:32.070]  Isn't that the one that was like right on the dateline and it switched sides at one point and they lost... or they gained a day?
[51:32.190 --> 51:33.710]  Like something weird happened with that little place.
[51:33.990 --> 51:34.250]  Really?
[51:34.690 --> 51:37.690]  I don't know, but I bet they were so fucking chill and relaxed they didn't notice.
[51:40.170 --> 51:47.170]  I think it was to do with like doing business with Australia or something, but it kept being the weekend on the wrong day. I don't know. I can't remember it.
[51:47.250 --> 51:51.150]  Hey, can I tell you guys about a little side story in the middle of this because it just happened?
[51:51.490 --> 51:51.810]  Of course.
[51:51.810 --> 51:55.370]  A little saga that's gone on in my library while you guys were talking about the Albanian flag.
[51:55.370 --> 51:57.110]  I'll pick the Welsh flag, by the way.
[51:57.230 --> 52:01.890]  Yeah, link it up, dude. I missed the first half of all of that because Henry started barking.
[52:01.890 --> 52:08.930]  I ran up to open the door for him because I was recording the other podcast I do this morning, the theme park one.
[52:09.750 --> 52:15.730]  And you know, Henry, there's a strict no squeezy toy rule in all other podcasts.
[52:16.350 --> 52:19.530]  It's like Vin Diesel saves his muscles for Vin Diesel movies.
[52:19.810 --> 52:22.110]  I save Henry's squeaks for fuck face, right?
[52:23.210 --> 52:30.710]  And so we have... I swear to God, there's a bit of a tension between Henry and I when I'm doing other podcasts where he just kind of is annoyed with me.
[52:30.710 --> 52:36.810]  And so this morning while I was recording with Jack, I had forgotten to open the door and it started to smell.
[52:37.010 --> 52:38.390]  And I thought Henry farted and I turned around.
[52:38.630 --> 52:43.910]  He took a giant mega shit right behind me this morning on the rug.
[52:44.270 --> 52:45.590]  And I was like, ah, damn it.
[52:45.630 --> 52:51.090]  And I went and I cleaned it up and I felt bad because it was my fault because I left the door closed so he could go potty after breakfast.
[52:51.350 --> 52:52.430]  And it just completely slipped my mind.
[52:52.790 --> 52:55.030]  I'm a little loopy today. I apologize. I'm on some cold meds.
[52:55.030 --> 53:02.890]  So, uh, when you guys started having the Albanian conversation, Henry started barking and I went, oh, fuck, he's about to take another dump.
[53:02.970 --> 53:06.870]  He's letting me know. And I ran over and I opened the door to let him out.
[53:06.930 --> 53:08.750]  But I forgot the alarm has been on all day.
[53:08.810 --> 53:10.410]  So then the alarm started going off.
[53:10.470 --> 53:12.910]  So then I had to run around the front of the house and disable the alarm.
[53:13.250 --> 53:15.970]  And then I came back in and I slid into the middle of it.
[53:16.010 --> 53:17.550]  I went, that's an interesting flag, Eric.
[53:17.610 --> 53:19.610]  Okay, nobody would have ever known.
[53:19.710 --> 53:21.650]  But it's too ridiculous not to tell you guys.
[53:21.730 --> 53:22.790]  How did you hear the alarm?
[53:23.270 --> 53:24.410]  I got it fast, dude.
[53:24.410 --> 53:24.990]  Oh.
[53:25.750 --> 53:27.950]  Also, uh, maybe you did hear it, I don't know.
[53:28.150 --> 53:28.330]  No.
[53:28.470 --> 53:33.950]  But, uh, anyway, you didn't hear it going, uh, back door open, alarm, alarm, or whatever she was saying.
[53:34.250 --> 53:34.910]  I heard it.
[53:35.990 --> 53:37.290]  Uh, anyway, Gavin, your flag?
[53:38.010 --> 53:38.670]  Uh, that's Wales.
[53:39.430 --> 53:40.230]  That's Wales.
[53:40.810 --> 53:41.350]  It's a dragon.
[53:41.710 --> 53:44.150]  I thought your people didn't like Wales.
[53:45.950 --> 53:48.350]  Uh, I don't think... I like Wales.
[53:48.870 --> 53:51.430]  I always, like, I remember when we were even there visiting.
[53:51.830 --> 53:53.030]  I was like, should we go to Wales?
[53:53.030 --> 53:54.410]  I want to go to Cardiff, or whatever.
[53:54.530 --> 53:56.010]  And you were like, there's no reason to go there, it's boring.
[53:56.490 --> 53:57.150]  Nobody likes Wales.
[53:57.350 --> 53:57.830]  I remember you telling me that.
[53:57.830 --> 53:59.090]  I didn't think that was ever on the cards.
[53:59.190 --> 54:01.010]  It was Scotland or France that we were going to go to.
[54:01.630 --> 54:06.110]  No, no, I remember, this is the ten year ago vacation, or fifteen years ago at this point.
[54:06.530 --> 54:10.670]  No, I remember it coming up, because I'm part Welsh, and I thought I wanted to go see the homeland.
[54:10.890 --> 54:11.590]  And you were like, no you don't.
[54:12.670 --> 54:13.810]  I was just guarding Wales.
[54:14.850 --> 54:16.330]  Uh, well, I don't remember that.
[54:16.930 --> 54:21.250]  Okay, well, for the record, I'm pro Wales.
[54:21.250 --> 54:22.810]  So, I like your flag.
[54:23.570 --> 54:30.930]  Do you think Eric had Albania ready to go, or did he just google list of countries in alphabetical order and picked one of the first ones?
[54:31.290 --> 54:33.410]  I think he googled angriest flag.
[54:33.950 --> 54:35.590]  I had it ready to go.
[54:36.110 --> 54:37.710]  I think Albania's flag is cool as shit.
[54:38.150 --> 54:38.430]  Okay.
[54:38.930 --> 54:39.510]  It is cool.
[54:39.730 --> 54:40.110]  Look at it!
[54:40.450 --> 54:44.330]  Gavin's has one tongue, yours has one bird, mine has two headed bird tongues.
[54:44.790 --> 54:45.010]  Awesome.
[54:45.390 --> 54:46.830]  Mine is like a tail tongue.
[54:47.870 --> 54:48.370]  It is true.
[54:49.130 --> 54:49.950]  Is that better?
[54:51.610 --> 54:53.330]  Maybe that might not even be a tongue.
[54:53.510 --> 54:54.790]  It might have just eaten another dragon.
[54:57.870 --> 54:59.730]  Or he's just got a tongue coming out of his ass.
[55:00.190 --> 55:00.970]  Think about it.
[55:01.370 --> 55:01.790]  I am.
[55:02.330 --> 55:06.410]  I don't, I genuinely don't like the Albania flag.
[55:07.070 --> 55:07.870]  Not a fan of it.
[55:08.490 --> 55:09.190]  You're crazy.
[55:09.570 --> 55:10.210]  I don't understand.
[55:10.470 --> 55:11.450]  Like, what do you want in a flag?
[55:11.450 --> 55:12.930]  I like the flag.
[55:12.930 --> 55:13.990]  I don't want to, I don't know.
[55:14.370 --> 55:15.110]  Like, I don't, hmm.
[55:15.730 --> 55:24.670]  I feel like that flag would be used to represent the villains in like a FromSoftware game is like the vibe I get.
[55:25.050 --> 55:26.290]  It's a menacing flag.
[55:26.850 --> 55:30.830]  And where are those, where are those villains in that game and what's the time frame?
[55:31.110 --> 55:34.090]  Well, like the Wolfenstein-like type games.
[55:34.090 --> 55:38.670]  Like, it's just the, like, it feels very military, militant.
[55:38.830 --> 55:40.690]  What is the word I'm looking for?
[55:41.370 --> 55:41.770]  Militant?
[55:42.070 --> 55:44.130]  I think Nazi is the word you're looking for.
[55:44.250 --> 55:45.370]  Militant is a Disney thing.
[55:45.850 --> 55:48.790]  I think you're trying to say it looks like World War II Nazi propaganda.
[55:48.790 --> 55:56.270]  I want it on the record that I got there without Nick, which he gave me the assist, or he had the right word, but I got there.
[55:56.670 --> 55:57.870]  Yeah, I also said it, but all right.
[55:58.190 --> 55:58.870]  I didn't hear you.
[55:58.970 --> 55:59.290]  I'm sorry.
[55:59.410 --> 56:00.310]  I wasn't, I wasn't listening.
[56:00.750 --> 56:01.130]  That's okay.
[56:05.230 --> 56:05.950]  Another callback.
[56:07.950 --> 56:11.390]  Well, your flag, I think your flag's a bit on the nose, isn't it?
[56:11.970 --> 56:12.590]  What do you mean?
[56:12.870 --> 56:13.310]  Whose flag?
[56:13.370 --> 56:13.650]  Canada.
[56:14.350 --> 56:16.050]  I never said I'd pick my flag.
[56:16.710 --> 56:17.630]  You're not a fan of your own flag?
[56:17.990 --> 56:19.530]  No, it's totally fine.
[56:19.650 --> 56:20.690]  I think I have a decent flag.
[56:20.970 --> 56:24.030]  I wouldn't, I don't think I'd pick Canada based off of the flag alone.
[56:24.650 --> 56:24.810]  Hmm.
[56:25.210 --> 56:27.310]  I think the USA flag is kind of a problem.
[56:27.790 --> 56:28.350]  In what way?
[56:28.350 --> 56:30.890]  Well, we've locked ourselves in with those 50 stars.
[56:31.150 --> 56:31.510]  Yeah.
[56:31.510 --> 56:33.270]  It makes it hard to add or subtract.
[56:33.450 --> 56:35.010]  Didn't always have 50 stars in it.
[56:35.310 --> 56:40.730]  No, it went from like, it didn't, you're right, but it's, I mean, if you look at it, it's proportioned very well.
[56:40.890 --> 56:47.030]  I've often tried to look at that flag and try to figure out how we would stick a Puerto Rico star in there or Guam or another country.
[56:47.310 --> 56:48.070]  Just ditch a state.
[56:48.510 --> 56:52.210]  Now that, that's an interesting, like we, we dump Arkansas, but pick up Guam.
[56:52.570 --> 56:54.610]  I think you can only remove and not add.
[56:54.670 --> 56:55.610]  Nobody likes DLC.
[56:56.210 --> 56:58.790]  It'd be a real problem to try to add on.
[56:59.190 --> 57:02.770]  I'd be pissed if I had to buy a whole new flag for one additional star.
[57:03.290 --> 57:05.890]  Well, they could add like DC as well, as it's own state.
[57:06.430 --> 57:06.690]  Yeah.
[57:06.850 --> 57:07.450]  That's a good point.
[57:07.910 --> 57:08.170]  Hmm.
[57:08.270 --> 57:08.970]  That is a good point.
[57:09.790 --> 57:09.950]  Hmm.
[57:10.390 --> 57:15.210]  Should we eat this fucking candy that's been on my desk for this entire episode?
[57:15.730 --> 57:17.070]  Am I the only one that did this?
[57:17.530 --> 57:18.450]  Did you not do this?
[57:18.550 --> 57:19.630]  Did you not do the prep gap?
[57:19.670 --> 57:21.150]  What do you mean, did he not do it?
[57:21.170 --> 57:22.310]  Of course he didn't do it.
[57:22.310 --> 57:25.910]  The only homework I wrote down was to turn up for pleasantries.
[57:28.150 --> 57:29.110]  What was the other thing?
[57:29.210 --> 57:29.830]  What did I need to buy?
[57:30.010 --> 57:33.690]  We were going to eat everybody's favorite candy, and then we were going to pick the best candy.
[57:33.850 --> 57:36.690]  And then I was thinking that could be the official candy of f***face for the year.
[57:37.090 --> 57:38.270]  And you have them too, Geoff?
[57:38.530 --> 57:39.190]  Of course I have.
[57:39.210 --> 57:39.810]  I've had them for weeks.
[57:40.230 --> 57:40.890]  What do I need?
[57:41.610 --> 57:46.490]  Well, you need for Geoff, you need Starburst.
[57:46.490 --> 57:51.330]  You need mini Starburst Unwrapped Flavor Reds.
[57:51.330 --> 57:54.350]  And you need Big Chewy Nerds.
[57:54.730 --> 57:59.270]  For Andrew, you need Big Chewy Sour Nerds.
[57:59.730 --> 58:01.890]  And then for Gavin, you need a Kinder Bueno.
[58:02.570 --> 58:03.490]  Okay, I got all that.
[58:09.250 --> 58:13.250]  I like that we opened this with the possibility of you...
[58:13.250 --> 58:16.770]  This has been a bad voiceover performance for you, these last two.
[58:17.030 --> 58:18.210]  They continued on.
[58:18.630 --> 58:20.070]  You want to try another take, buddy?
[58:20.150 --> 58:20.890]  Nobody has...
[58:20.890 --> 58:25.030]  I kind of wish you reminded me during the pleasantries and I could have ordered something.
[58:25.930 --> 58:30.450]  I reminded you technically last night when I asked what is everybody's candy.
[58:31.230 --> 58:32.110]  I need to do this.
[58:32.230 --> 58:32.890]  When did you say this?
[58:33.150 --> 58:34.610]  That was in the f***face chat.
[58:35.350 --> 58:37.030]  12.10 a.m. today.
[58:37.190 --> 58:38.650]  It's probably one of the first messages you've seen.
[58:38.870 --> 58:40.650]  What candy do we need for tomorrow?
[58:40.650 --> 58:47.070]  In which Geoff replied, Kinder Bueno, Chewy Nerds, your candy, which wouldn't have been helpful to you, Gavin.
[58:47.210 --> 58:48.870]  So I'd understand if you would have missed that one.
[58:49.470 --> 58:51.070]  Starburst Chews, only the reds.
[58:51.310 --> 58:54.190]  Now, you seem to say a different product, Geoff.
[58:54.590 --> 58:58.110]  Is it okay that I just have Starburst Minis and I qualify...
[58:58.110 --> 58:59.790]  Like, just the reds is what you're saying.
[59:00.210 --> 59:01.710]  I have a bag of all of them.
[59:02.250 --> 59:02.950]  So here's the deal.
[59:03.230 --> 59:04.430]  I wasn't aware.
[59:04.550 --> 59:08.110]  I first started buying these at Hobby Lobby when I was going to buy Christmas stuff.
[59:08.470 --> 59:09.830]  And so I just grabbed what I saw.
[59:09.830 --> 59:11.510]  And I didn't really look at the package too closely.
[59:11.710 --> 59:19.450]  I didn't realize that I was eating flavor reds until the other day I bought a bag of the regular Starburst and it tasted like doo-doo.
[59:19.630 --> 59:22.930]  And then I realized that I had gotten the wrong thing.
[59:22.970 --> 59:30.070]  So you can achieve the same goal, but you just can't eat any of the yellow or orange Starburst out of there.
[59:30.530 --> 59:32.090]  Only pink, red, and dark red.
[59:32.210 --> 59:33.230]  Well, I can eat them.
[59:33.270 --> 59:35.290]  I just am not evaluating as far as my...
[59:35.290 --> 59:36.050]  They're not a part of this.
[59:36.110 --> 59:38.030]  Well, they'll taint the palate.
[59:39.010 --> 59:40.970]  Here, I'm going to open one of these things.
[59:41.050 --> 59:42.090]  Do you want to pretend that it's you?
[59:42.290 --> 59:43.390]  I'll just make the sound.
[59:43.550 --> 59:43.790]  Ready?
[59:44.550 --> 59:44.730]  Yeah.
[59:48.410 --> 59:50.170]  That was just me opening the...
[59:50.170 --> 59:51.010]  I haven't even opened...
[59:51.010 --> 59:52.350]  Why are you slurping chocolate?
[59:52.350 --> 59:54.430]  Gavin drank the wrapper, it sounded like.
[59:54.770 --> 59:55.650]  What are you doing?
[59:57.230 --> 59:58.130]  Slurped the wrapper.
[59:58.670 --> 59:59.790]  Why would you do that?
[01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:03.250]  I have a lot of questions.
[01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:06.130]  I'm opening up my big chewy nerds.
[01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:08.010]  I'm opening up...
[01:00:08.970 --> 01:00:11.150]  This is invalid because we don't have Gavin.
[01:00:11.810 --> 01:00:13.070]  I feel like he could...
[01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:14.990]  We didn't have Andrew for the Cosmic Crisp.
[01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:15.690]  I'll just do Aaliyah.
[01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.690]  Oh, that's fine.
[01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:18.050]  That's a great point.
[01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:21.490]  Not a great question, but it was a great point.
[01:00:22.290 --> 01:00:24.070]  Honestly, Andrew, I feel like I haven't spoken to you in a while
[01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:26.150]  because ever since I found out you lied to me about Halo,
[01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:28.090]  I haven't texted you about playing Halo.
[01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:32.830]  Are those connected?
[01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:34.030]  You're not wrong.
[01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:36.790]  It's been playing alone.
[01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:39.470]  Oh, that's sad. That's lonely.
[01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:43.110]  Oh, these are weird. These Starburst minis are weird.
[01:00:43.830 --> 01:00:44.810]  These are fucking weird.
[01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:47.190]  Just pink, red, and dark red, please.
[01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:50.090]  They just don't look like I'd assume that they would look like.
[01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:52.470]  They're different than Starburst.
[01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:53.590]  That's what's good about them.
[01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:54.730]  They're like a unique thing.
[01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:55.410]  Okay.
[01:00:55.890 --> 01:00:57.750]  They're perfect size. They're perfect to chew.
[01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:59.270]  I'm gonna get some of your sour.
[01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:01.070]  I'm gonna get four sour nerds.
[01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:03.950]  I'm gonna get four regular nerds, although I know what mine tastes like.
[01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:07.330]  So, you know roughly how big this bag is, right?
[01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:09.530]  Yeah, I mean, I assume it's the same size as mine is.
[01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:12.670]  191 grams. Is that how big your bag is?
[01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:15.310]  Mine is 99 grams.
[01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:17.750]  So, mine's bigger than yours.
[01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:19.070]  Don't brag about it.
[01:01:19.570 --> 01:01:22.290]  No, I'm just gonna... I think I could eat all these at once.
[01:01:22.810 --> 01:01:25.630]  Oh, I've already eaten a bag of them today, just while we've been sitting here.
[01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:27.290]  No, I mean, it's at the same time.
[01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:28.970]  Like a one mouthful?
[01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:31.110]  I think I could do a mouthful of these.
[01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:33.310]  Please take the yellow and the orange out, or it's gonna ruin everything.
[01:01:33.310 --> 01:01:35.510]  I took out the reds to review separately.
[01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:36.510]  I'm just gonna try this.
[01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:37.510]  We're gonna just put...
[01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:40.690]  So, are you starting off by eating everything that's remaining?
[01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:43.170]  I'm gonna eat the shit I don't want you to eat.
[01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:45.690]  Yeah, it's gonna cleanse... it's gonna take this pallet.
[01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:50.690]  That's what I'm saying. The orange and the yellow is objectively bad.
[01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:52.470]  It's gonna ruin your experience.
[01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:55.870]  Do they bite well?
[01:01:56.370 --> 01:01:56.790]  They bite.
[01:01:57.630 --> 01:01:59.850]  Yeah, they do, actually. They're great to chew.
[01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:03.510]  Not the entire fucking bag, you idiot!
[01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:07.110]  Put four or five in your mouth and it chews like a charm.
[01:02:11.050 --> 01:02:12.190]  This fucking guy.
[01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:18.150]  Oh, he's getting air? He's coming up for air?
[01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:21.590]  They do not have the texture you expect them to.
[01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:23.990]  Yeah, now how about you eat the ones I asked you to?
[01:02:24.010 --> 01:02:25.030]  I thought they'd be chewy.
[01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:25.970]  They are chewy.
[01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:26.610]  Oh, they're not chewy?
[01:02:27.070 --> 01:02:27.990]  Of course they're chewy.
[01:02:28.070 --> 01:02:30.650]  No, they're not like gummy chewy. I thought they'd be gummy chewy.
[01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:31.910]  What kind of chewy are they?
[01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:33.150]  They're still starburst-y.
[01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:38.490]  They're like 85% as chewy as starburst- or like as...
[01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:42.650]  They're like a little bit softer and a little bit more chewy than a starburst.
[01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:44.250]  But not by much.
[01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:46.170]  But it's nice. And they're small.
[01:02:46.570 --> 01:02:47.590]  So they're like...
[01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:51.610]  They're like, I would say one of these things is maybe a quarter the size of one starburst.
[01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:54.970]  I think these are a better snack than candy. I'll give you that.
[01:02:55.310 --> 01:02:56.230]  Yeah, I didn't...
[01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:59.150]  If I was in the mood for starburst, I'd take these over the other type.
[01:02:59.290 --> 01:03:00.970]  I will never eat another starburst again.
[01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:04.090]  I will only have these mini starbursts.
[01:03:04.090 --> 01:03:06.590]  Do not try to eat the whole bag at once. This is terrible.
[01:03:06.930 --> 01:03:09.490]  I'm gonna try... well, I don't know what my shit tastes like.
[01:03:09.610 --> 01:03:12.010]  I'm gonna try your sour big chewy Nerds.
[01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:15.670]  It's like all of my saliva is gummy flavored right now.
[01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:17.890]  But they're not gummy in texture.
[01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:22.670]  Not gummy in texture, no. Just my entire mouth tastes like, oh, this is not good.
[01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:25.610]  I like your big sour Nerds, but they're not sour.
[01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:28.550]  They're way better. They're way better than the base Nerds.
[01:03:28.550 --> 01:03:33.730]  I like the base chewy Nerds better, I think. Big chewy Nerds in the yellow package, but these are pretty good.
[01:03:34.450 --> 01:03:37.770]  If only we had a third person to make rulings on things.
[01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:39.350]  I know. Oops.
[01:03:40.030 --> 01:03:41.310]  Have you had these candies, Eric?
[01:03:41.830 --> 01:03:46.750]  Yeah, I don't think I've had a Kinder Bueno, but I know what Geoff's thing is. I like them.
[01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:48.790]  Why'd you say it like it was filth?
[01:03:49.210 --> 01:03:52.630]  Because Kinder Bueno seems like a non-American candy.
[01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:56.350]  How does Albania feel about the Kinder Bueno?
[01:03:56.350 --> 01:04:03.190]  Because there's a commercial for Kinder Bueno, I think, where a guy's riding his bicycle, and I think it's clear that it's not...
[01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:08.310]  They're trying to pass it off like, oh, we filmed this here, and it's not. It's a foreign commercial, you can tell.
[01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:10.610]  You can just look at it and be like, this isn't right.
[01:04:11.170 --> 01:04:12.790]  So I vote Geoff's candy is the winner.
[01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:15.370]  There we go. There's the pile of candy.
[01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:18.070]  That's a really shit photo, Geoff.
[01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:19.570]  I don't know why...
[01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:20.650]  That's what we've established.
[01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:23.250]  Geoff's the worst photo taker.
[01:04:23.890 --> 01:04:25.710]  I'm just happy that it's centered.
[01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:30.430]  I don't understand what's going on with that photo, or where that photo came from.
[01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:31.530]  That's not the photo I took.
[01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:33.090]  What do you mean? You just took it and posted it.
[01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:36.710]  Here's the photo I took and posted. I don't understand why it came out differently.
[01:04:38.330 --> 01:04:40.090]  What are you talking about?
[01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:42.090]  Those are separate images.
[01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:46.930]  I must have taken the other one without even realizing it.
[01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:50.390]  He took like a, I'm putting my phone back in my pocket photo.
[01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:53.690]  Yeah, I think I'm putting my phone back in my pocket photo, for sure.
[01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:59.070]  Oh, it is sideways. You're right. I'm putting the phone back down.
[01:04:59.370 --> 01:04:59.730]  Yeah.
[01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:01.350]  That's incredible.
[01:05:03.130 --> 01:05:05.070]  And you just sent it without even looking at it.
[01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:06.750]  That could have been bad. I'm glad you're wearing pants.
[01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:10.790]  Well, I just sent the most recent photo, because that's the one I thought I took. I wasn't really...
[01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:15.830]  This is nice.
[01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:17.830]  Which one are you on now?
[01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:21.390]  The Kinder Bueno, it has like a, it's a really creamy chocolate.
[01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:25.970]  And then the wafer is really, it's really light. It's a really light wafer.
[01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:31.090]  Yeah, I think it's made by the same people as the Ferrero people.
[01:05:31.810 --> 01:05:32.630]  I think it's the same company.
[01:05:32.730 --> 01:05:34.290]  Which own, don't they own Nutella?
[01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:37.070]  That was weird to me to discover.
[01:05:37.330 --> 01:05:37.570]  Did they?
[01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:39.630]  Ferrero Rocher company owns Nutella.
[01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:43.710]  Because Nutella to me doesn't at all fit the tone of that company.
[01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:46.570]  Like Ferrero Rocher is like a fancy ass chocolate in my head.
[01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:47.970]  Where Nutella feels like...
[01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:50.110]  You can buy a three pack for like three quid.
[01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:51.990]  Feels like a kid's candy.
[01:05:52.590 --> 01:05:54.390]  Like it feels like a child's spread.
[01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:57.530]  I could have phrased that better.
[01:05:57.850 --> 01:05:59.570]  But like a schoolyard...
[01:06:00.110 --> 01:06:01.350]  I'm just gonna give up.
[01:06:01.530 --> 01:06:03.750]  I'm tempted to describe what I think Nutella is.
[01:06:05.310 --> 01:06:05.750]  A child's spread.
[01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:07.630]  That's the last of the episode title, a child's spread.
[01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:14.970]  Alright, so we'll need to get these candies to Gavin so he can be the final determiner.
[01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:17.290]  I'm gonna go ahead and go one to four.
[01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:18.970]  I'm gonna go...
[01:06:20.290 --> 01:06:22.130]  Mini, Starburst, All the Reds, number one.
[01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:23.950]  Kinder Boy, no close second.
[01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:27.210]  Third, the Yellow Bag of Nerds.
[01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:29.250]  Fourth, Andrew's Candy. No offense.
[01:06:29.850 --> 01:06:32.470]  I'd like you to do it in the least tense order.
[01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:34.230]  No suspense involved.
[01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:35.610]  Do you really care?
[01:06:35.810 --> 01:06:36.870]  Do you want me to go back and do it the other way?
[01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:40.080]  Alright, coming in at fourth place...
[01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:42.590]  I liked it a lot.
[01:06:42.590 --> 01:06:45.230]  It's my least favorite of the bunch, but I still thought it was really good.
[01:06:45.290 --> 01:06:46.830]  I'm still gonna eat it all the time.
[01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:48.870]  I'm still a fan. I'm still a stan.
[01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:52.230]  Don't get me wrong, but you gotta have a best and you gotta have a worst of the bunch.
[01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:54.970]  Worst of the bunch for me, number four...
[01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:56.990]  Sour Big Chewy Nerds.
[01:06:57.270 --> 01:07:01.350]  Coming in just a little bit, edging out the Sour Big Chewy Nerds.
[01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:02.990]  It's gonna be the Yellow Bag of Nerds.
[01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:08.130]  That's right, in third place, bronze medal goes to Big Chewy Nerds No Sour.
[01:07:08.410 --> 01:07:11.410]  Then, it was a tight, tight, tight race between silver and gold.
[01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:15.550]  Very tight race. The Olympics has not seen a race this tight in years, right?
[01:07:16.310 --> 01:07:17.440]  Coming in at number two...
[01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:22.600]  Runner-up, in case number one can't fulfill its duties as the best candy in the world, number two...
[01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:23.830]  Kinder Bueno!
[01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:26.410]  Which leaves number one...
[01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:29.690]  Mini Starburst, all the red.
[01:07:32.550 --> 01:07:35.790]  What is the reverse of the salad cream?
[01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:37.710]  Because that's what that was.
[01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:42.030]  That was equally... that was not needed.
[01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:45.210]  You got what you asked for.
[01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:45.830]  I agree!
[01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:50.270]  That's like the reverse of a salad cream. Like, you delivered, but it was equally...
[01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:52.070]  Once again, I don't need the tux off to the wedding.
[01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:54.370]  Nick and Eric both liked it. Thank you guys.
[01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:56.710]  I thought it was good, too. I'm a fan.
[01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:59.090]  But it's just the reverse of a salad cream.
[01:07:59.270 --> 01:08:02.290]  You mean I did the opposite of what you did with the salad cream?
[01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:04.990]  Well, thanks for that compliment. I appreciate it, buddy.
[01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:11.490]  I guess it is a compliment. I guess this is a weird way. I didn't mean it as one, but I guess I did just compliment you.
[01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:14.010]  That wasn't intended to be that.
[01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:19.070]  Is that the first unintended, unenthusiastic compliment we've had in F*** Face?
[01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:23.570]  You can't take it back. It was a compliment. It's a regulation compliment. It's on the books.
[01:08:23.770 --> 01:08:26.050]  It's certainly not a regulation compliment.
[01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:27.810]  It's an official 2022 regulation compliment.
[01:08:28.310 --> 01:08:30.390]  Eric is our judge. He said it.
[01:08:30.930 --> 01:08:32.470]  Schwartz... Nick said it as well.
[01:08:33.130 --> 01:08:34.050]  Congratulations to me.
[01:08:34.050 --> 01:08:38.410]  What do you even call that? Like a side-handed compliment? A sidewise compliment?
[01:08:39.010 --> 01:08:39.830]  Yeah, a sideways compliment.
[01:08:40.270 --> 01:08:41.890]  Fun fact about the sideways compliment.
[01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:45.410]  Dusty Baker invented it in like 1985.
[01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:46.230]  Interesting.
[01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:48.270]  Yeah, it's a great fact.
[01:08:49.650 --> 01:08:57.290]  I like that this podcast started as a baseball podcast about a baseball player that we no longer ever talk about or mention.
[01:08:57.410 --> 01:08:58.890]  And that's what the show is named after.
[01:08:59.450 --> 01:09:04.030]  On our list of baseball people...
[01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:08.950]  Who cares about my list? I can't top what Geoff just did. He reversed salad creamed it.
[01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:11.310]  I can't do anything better than that.
[01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:14.070]  But I can't...
[01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.930]  God damn it.
[01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:19.910]  Alright, well if nobody else is going to review the candy, then I get to declare mini Starburst all the reds.
[01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:20.750]  No, the Andrew s***.
[01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:21.770]  Not flavor reds.
[01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:23.750]  Well, I want to hear Andrew's s*** too.
[01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:27.790]  And then I need you to tie-break it, Gavin. And then we may have to get Nick and Eric involved.
[01:09:28.090 --> 01:09:31.110]  Well, where did you... Could you go through the list again of where you ranked them?
[01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:33.850]  How do I tie-break a rank of four?
[01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:37.530]  Here's what we're going to do. We're going to assign a point value to each one.
[01:09:37.890 --> 01:09:40.930]  The first place gets four points.
[01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:44.370]  Second place gets two... or three...
[01:09:44.370 --> 01:09:45.830]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:47.570]  You've Andrewed me all up.
[01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:49.710]  So four points right now...
[01:09:49.710 --> 01:09:53.810]  You have four points right now for mini Starburst flavor reds.
[01:09:54.150 --> 01:09:55.770]  Three points for a Kinder Bueno.
[01:09:56.010 --> 01:09:57.890]  We've got two points for the Big Chewy Nerds.
[01:09:57.930 --> 01:09:59.890]  And then one point for the Sour Big Chewy Nerds.
[01:09:59.890 --> 01:10:04.830]  I feel like this system only works if we anonymously submit beforehand.
[01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:08.210]  Because I'm going to put four points on the Sour Nerds.
[01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:09.510]  Because I want them in.
[01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:10.330]  That's fine.
[01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:13.190]  I'm putting one point on the Starburst.
[01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:14.990]  Because it currently has four.
[01:10:15.810 --> 01:10:18.150]  I'll just do the reverse of what Geoff has done.
[01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:18.950]  You're a fool!
[01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:20.250]  Why am I a fool?
[01:10:21.170 --> 01:10:22.250]  Now see, here's the problem.
[01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:25.590]  I asked for honest evaluations of the candy.
[01:10:26.170 --> 01:10:27.670]  And Andrew has gamified it.
[01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:30.090]  Well, you just did this whole thing!
[01:10:30.650 --> 01:10:31.670]  No, listen.
[01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:33.090]  No, be quiet for a second.
[01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:33.830]  You idiot.
[01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:36.750]  You just said you wanted Gavin to be the tiebreaker.
[01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:37.590]  Stupid.
[01:10:37.770 --> 01:10:42.410]  If I give four to your number one, then there's no tiebreak.
[01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:43.710]  We don't need the other number.
[01:10:43.730 --> 01:10:47.010]  I said he's there to be the tiebreaker if we need it.
[01:10:47.130 --> 01:10:48.070]  I misheard that.
[01:10:48.170 --> 01:10:48.670]  I apologize.
[01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:49.490]  That's on me.
[01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:50.890]  That's just a direct apology.
[01:10:51.130 --> 01:10:52.010]  I didn't hear that part.
[01:10:52.090 --> 01:10:53.290]  I missed that part of what you said.
[01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:54.050]  I apologize.
[01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:55.550]  Number four.
[01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:58.890]  I would make, if we're doing a genuine review.
[01:10:58.990 --> 01:11:00.430]  That was a regulation apology.
[01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:03.010]  And this is going to be a regulation review in this moment.
[01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:05.610]  I'm going to be honest about my opinions of all these candies.
[01:11:05.610 --> 01:11:06.470]  Are you doing the same scoring system?
[01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:09.030]  I'm doing the same scoring system.
[01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:10.510]  But I'm going to do it.
[01:11:11.050 --> 01:11:11.330]  Should I?
[01:11:11.770 --> 01:11:12.210]  No.
[01:11:12.970 --> 01:11:13.330]  No.
[01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:14.310]  Not that.
[01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:16.210]  Do I go lowest first?
[01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:17.830]  Do I build to what my number one is?
[01:11:17.970 --> 01:11:18.790]  Number one.
[01:11:18.970 --> 01:11:19.810]  Getting one point.
[01:11:20.290 --> 01:11:25.390]  The lowest on this totem pole is, to me, the standard nerds.
[01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:28.130]  That was a great burp that I threw in at the same time.
[01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:30.230]  A little extra for you on the side.
[01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:34.330]  I'm going with the gummy nerds, number one, because there is a superior version of it.
[01:11:34.450 --> 01:11:35.810]  Wait, number four or number one?
[01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:36.890]  Number one.
[01:11:36.970 --> 01:11:37.470]  One point.
[01:11:37.570 --> 01:11:38.930]  Getting one point at the bottom.
[01:11:39.330 --> 01:11:39.670]  That's number four.
[01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:40.650]  No.
[01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:42.030]  No, it's not.
[01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:43.590]  Number four is the lowest.
[01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:44.790]  Coming in at number four with one point.
[01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.890]  No.
[01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:46.730]  Okay, we're getting these all mixed up.
[01:11:47.050 --> 01:11:47.730]  I'm giving...
[01:11:47.730 --> 01:11:47.990]  You are.
[01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.830]  No.
[01:11:49.370 --> 01:11:54.350]  It's coming in at number four, but it's getting one point on the list.
[01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:55.330]  Okay, correct.
[01:11:55.330 --> 01:11:55.690]  One point.
[01:11:55.850 --> 01:12:00.690]  Coming in at four with one point is the nerd... the standard nerds.
[01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:01.910]  The regular gummy nerds.
[01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:02.590]  Okay, yellow bag nerds.
[01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:06.170]  The yellow bag nerds, one point, fourth place.
[01:12:06.570 --> 01:12:09.950]  Coming in at third place is the Starburst shoes.
[01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:12.490]  I just am not the biggest Starburst fan.
[01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:14.230]  I don't really care for them, but they're good.
[01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:15.490]  Like, for what they are, they're good.
[01:12:15.550 --> 01:12:17.450]  I think that's the best version of Starburst.
[01:12:17.610 --> 01:12:20.550]  They've innovated on a thing that I didn't realize they could innovate on.
[01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:21.350]  I give them credit.
[01:12:21.450 --> 01:12:22.990]  They get two points in third place.
[01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:27.590]  In second place, with three points, is the Kinder Bueno.
[01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:28.650]  They're good.
[01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:32.850]  I'm never going to opt for these, but I'll never be sad that they're there.
[01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:35.550]  And number one, because I picked it, it's obviously a bias.
[01:12:35.650 --> 01:12:39.090]  My favorite personal candy is the Sour Nerd, so I'm giving that four points.
[01:12:39.610 --> 01:12:45.930]  So that gives us a two place tie... a two candy tie for first right now, right?
[01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:49.910]  With the Starburst having four points for me and two for you, that gives them six.
[01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:54.310]  And then my Kinder Bueno and your Kinder Bueno both coming in with three points each gives them six.
[01:12:54.490 --> 01:12:57.170]  So Gavin will have to be the deciding factor.
[01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:59.530]  We'll have to get these candies to him.
[01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:01.110]  I wonder which he will pick.
[01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:05.350]  His favorite candy or some other candy.
[01:13:05.850 --> 01:13:08.390]  Well, it depends. He hasn't tried them.
[01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:09.370]  That's fair.
[01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:16.990]  And also, if I think that the Kinder Bueno is the second best candy, and you think the Kinder Bueno is the second best candy,
[01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:21.450]  and Gavin truly thinks it's the best candy, then it is clearly the winner.
[01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:24.050]  I don't... I feel like this is gonna...
[01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:26.890]  Because I don't... I... Can we all agree?
[01:13:27.250 --> 01:13:30.550]  Outside of Gavin, the Kinder Bueno is not the best candy.
[01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:32.750]  It's a very good candy.
[01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:35.410]  But it's not the best candy.
[01:13:35.770 --> 01:13:37.130]  That's what he put up, dude.
[01:13:37.410 --> 01:13:39.090]  We can only write what he gives us.
[01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:41.590]  I understand. This is what's gonna fucking happen, though.
[01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:43.850]  What is that Denzel Washington train movie?
[01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:45.370]  Money Train?
[01:13:45.370 --> 01:13:46.110]  No.
[01:13:46.530 --> 01:13:49.370]  It's not that. It's not the Taking a Pelham 1-2-3.
[01:13:49.690 --> 01:13:52.590]  What was the name of... Unbreakable... No.
[01:13:52.810 --> 01:13:55.190]  What was... What was the name of it?
[01:13:55.290 --> 01:13:55.950]  Bruce Willis?
[01:13:56.470 --> 01:14:00.350]  No, it's Chris Pine and Denzel Washington, and it's a Tony Scott movie.
[01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:05.990]  I watched that movie on mute on a plane once. I didn't hear a single word that was said, but I watched the entire movie.
[01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.730]  Unstoppable! Thank you.
[01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:06.850]  Unstoppable.
[01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:12.110]  We have an unstoppable problem with this candy thing.
[01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:14.130]  Nick said train-ing day.
[01:14:14.130 --> 01:14:18.050]  If you go on... Let me pull it up.
[01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:23.070]  I think Unstoppable has like a 90 on Rotten Tomatoes, but nobody thinks it's great.
[01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:26.370]  It's just universally, like, that was a totally fine movie.
[01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:27.210]  Like, it's solid.
[01:14:27.810 --> 01:14:33.970]  Like, it's solid. Nobody hates... It has an 87. That is not an 87% movie.
[01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:42.610]  Can I just say, if you are a regulation listener or a comment leaver, or you're a regulation listener who would like to become a comment leaver, let us know how you feel about Unstoppable.
[01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:46.550]  Is it your favorite train movie? Is it your favorite movie? Is Andrew wrong?
[01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:52.410]  Are there hardcore Pine and Washington train stands out there? We want to know.
[01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:54.450]  What is my favorite train movie?
[01:14:55.010 --> 01:14:58.750]  Hmm. I didn't like The Taking of Pelham 1, 2, 3, but I haven't seen the original.
[01:14:59.490 --> 01:15:00.970]  John Travolta one was not great.
[01:15:01.650 --> 01:15:03.830]  Snowpiercer is a good train movie.
[01:15:04.090 --> 01:15:05.110]  Does speed count?
[01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:07.910]  Why would speed be a train movie?
[01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:09.910]  Because it ends on a train?
[01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:12.770]  Yeah, but the point of the movie is not the train.
[01:15:13.190 --> 01:15:18.010]  What about The Core? That's sort of a train that goes into the earth. That's an earth train.
[01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:19.930]  That's a great bad movie.
[01:15:20.150 --> 01:15:21.910]  What was that Gene Wilder...
[01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:28.860]  Oh yeah, Silver Streak.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:32.680]  With Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor.
[01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:34.620]  Yeah, that was a train movie.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:40.200]  Although, that movie is from the 70's and it was an edgy comedy, so it probably hasn't held up well.
[01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:42.740]  In terms of being problematic.
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:46.680]  I remember the scene that you're referring to.
[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:47.940]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:53.580]  Also, if you guys would look, I posted a picture of the Sour Big Chewy Nerds.
[01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:58.420]  I don't know if you guys noticed it, but doesn't it look like that nerd is shitting out a penis?
[01:15:58.420 --> 01:15:59.140]  It does!
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:02.620]  Like, doesn't that seem like they should have caught that in cue?
[01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:04.900]  Yeah, it looks like the bottom rung of a set of anal beads.
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:08.820]  Yeah, it really does seem like he's got the last anal bead sticking out.
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:10.440]  You would think they would have caught that.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.960]  I would argue that the Big Chewy one is even worse, Geoff.
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:19.720]  I ripped, unfortunately, where, if you could look at the Big Chewy bag...
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:20.860]  Oh! On the right? On the right?
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:25.220]  Yes, it is protruding out of his ass.
[01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:26.680]  Like, it is halfway out.
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:32.000]  It looks like he just took a shit and the pink one is a hemorrhoid.
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.080]  He's got a hemorrhoid.
[01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:34.880]  Yeah, let's get this picture. I can't see.
[01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:38.560]  And then Eric's going to lose his mind if we don't stop talking, so I'll add that up.
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.120]  I'll add this and we'll end it.
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:44.920]  Also, we should mention while I'm uploading this, Tiki mugs are on sale now, unless they've already sold out.
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:50.120]  Eric and I did a ton of videos and promo for them the other day and had just the nicest time together.
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:51.440]  There you go.
[01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:53.240]  Oh, it looks like a little...
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:55.220]  He's licking his lips. He's so happy.
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.260]  It's like somebody pushed this thing back in.
[01:16:58.340 --> 01:16:59.340]  Looks like a little grape.
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:03.220]  Wait, are they nerds? Are we eating those?
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.540]  Yeah, we're eating nerd shit.
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:10.840]  Well, no, that's not what I meant, but that's also terrible.
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:13.780]  What did you mean? Are we eating the physical nerd?
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.720]  I meant, is the character the food from his ass?
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.120]  You know how, like, when you have a prawn, there's a digestive tract that you can remove from it?
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:22.520]  Right.
[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:24.260]  Are we eating...
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:24.620]  So, are you...
[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:26.680]  Because you have to, like...
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:31.580]  That's like, a cheap prawn still has the shit tract down the spine of it.
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:34.560]  Million dollars, but you have to eat a bag of prawn colons.
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:36.320]  Are they deep fried?
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:37.960]  Yeah, I'll eat them.
[01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:38.860]  Wait, no.
[01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:42.060]  I've been eating de-veined nerds all day long.
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:45.340]  Why isn't tempura used in more places?
[01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:47.760]  Okay, goodbye. Thank you.
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:48.140]  What do you mean, Eric?
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:51.540]  Thank you, goodbye. Have a good one. TikiMug, store.roosterteeth.com. Goodbye.
[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:53.100]  But we're cutting all the pleasantries out.
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.820]  No, no, the pleasantries are in.
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:55.780]  Oh, no.
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:57.800]  And also, it's been well over an hour.
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:58.960]  He's got a point.
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:01.300]  No, I do, I know. I'm very aware.
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:04.060]  Nobody said anything while someone was opening something.
[01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:11.100]  I agree with Gavin. Also, once again, why doesn't, like, McDonald's do tempura?
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:14.440]  I also, for the record, I hacked away this morning.
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.100]  I was hacking this morning.
[01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:17.120]  I hacked away.
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:17.700]  Geoff, say goodbye.
[01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:18.320]  I got another three.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:18.900]  Geoff, say goodbye.
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:20.660]  I got three more hotcakes.
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:21.600]  Geoff, just say goodbye.
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:23.140]  I gotta go. I'm tired.
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:24.240]  The hack still works.
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:25.640]  I'm going back to bed.
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:27.380]  I'm going back to bed.
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:28.660]  Alright, goodnight.
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:29.400]  Bye.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:34.140]  Hey guys, Minor League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.520]  Episode 91 is spanky dandy.
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:39.460]  We still don't know the origins of Jingle Jingle Jingle.
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:41.800]  Gavin gets to the bottom of illegal knobs.
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:45.060]  Someone stole the idea of using witchcraft to fix football.
[01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:47.540]  Gavin's razor blade slot is full.
[01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:50.460]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:53.660]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
