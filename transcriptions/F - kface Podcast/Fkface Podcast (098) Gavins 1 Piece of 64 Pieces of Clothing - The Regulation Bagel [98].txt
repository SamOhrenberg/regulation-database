[00:05.080 --> 00:06.400]  Previously on F*** Face.
[00:16.490 --> 00:21.770]  Hello and welcome to episode 98 of the F*** Face podcast.
[00:22.230 --> 00:23.610]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:23.910 --> 00:26.130]  And with me, as always, two people.
[00:26.410 --> 00:27.310]  One of them is a friend.
[00:27.430 --> 00:28.710]  One of them is a co-worker.
[00:28.830 --> 00:29.830]  I'll let you figure that out.
[00:30.050 --> 00:31.550]  Gavin Free and Andrew Panton.
[00:31.870 --> 00:32.770]  How's it going, boys?
[00:33.770 --> 00:34.710]  Good, thanks, Andrew.
[00:34.790 --> 00:36.110]  Which one do you think you are right now?
[00:36.110 --> 00:40.910]  Well, considering that in the description of this show, I'm not listed as the friend.
[00:41.070 --> 00:45.450]  It would be like just a ridiculous upset if I was the friend and not go.
[00:45.710 --> 00:50.490]  If I have somehow elevated the friend during the 98 episodes of the show,
[00:50.730 --> 00:52.030]  that'd be ridiculous.
[00:52.510 --> 00:56.730]  Everyone involved with this show has been my friend at one point or another.
[00:56.830 --> 00:58.530]  Just not always at the same time.
[00:58.810 --> 01:02.930]  I would be gutted because I would consider to this day, to this hour,
[01:03.090 --> 01:05.170]  Geoff, my best friend on the earth.
[01:05.170 --> 01:09.470]  And if I was relegated to co-worker, it'd be very one-sided and I'd be upset.
[01:09.990 --> 01:14.470]  I have definitely also considered you my best friend on earth many, many times.
[01:14.930 --> 01:16.110]  Why are you saying it in the past tense?
[01:16.110 --> 01:18.810]  Not not not in the entirety of my life, but at different times.
[01:19.550 --> 01:22.610]  Hey, by the way, speaking of you said gutted, speaking of gut,
[01:22.770 --> 01:26.350]  Eric, our producer extraordinaire, how many hot dogs can you eat in one sitting?
[01:26.850 --> 01:28.310]  It wasn't really a sitting.
[01:28.470 --> 01:31.530]  There was a lot of walking and walking around and eating more hot dogs.
[01:31.530 --> 01:36.790]  Last night I ate four regular hot dogs and one grilled cheese hot dog.
[01:37.590 --> 01:39.170]  That doesn't seem like a lot.
[01:39.270 --> 01:42.610]  But I also had like three 32 ounce beers and peanuts.
[01:42.990 --> 01:45.410]  It was so for regulation hot dogs.
[01:45.490 --> 01:47.490]  And you had you had jalapenos on them, right?
[01:47.510 --> 01:50.810]  I put jalapenos on every single one of them and I don't feel good.
[01:50.870 --> 01:52.490]  So I might be running back and forth during this.
[01:52.550 --> 01:54.190]  But please proceed like I'm here the whole time.
[01:54.450 --> 01:57.050]  Running back and forth to shit
[01:58.750 --> 02:00.890]  is what you're saying. OK, yeah.
[02:00.890 --> 02:04.270]  I think there's all sorts of implied things that could happen in that scenario.
[02:05.350 --> 02:07.610]  Why imply? Let's get into the weeds with it.
[02:07.990 --> 02:09.330]  I don't think he knows.
[02:10.250 --> 02:11.550]  Why'd you do that to your buddy?
[02:11.910 --> 02:13.210]  Because it's hot. What do you mean?
[02:13.330 --> 02:14.550]  Why did you do that? It's dollar hot dog night, dude.
[02:14.650 --> 02:15.530]  What are you going to do?
[02:15.910 --> 02:18.890]  Last night was the Round Rock Express.
[02:19.010 --> 02:22.370]  The local AAA baseball team is opening week.
[02:22.610 --> 02:24.310]  They're playing the El Paso Chihuahuas.
[02:24.490 --> 02:26.790]  And it was dollar hot dog and soda night.
[02:27.250 --> 02:29.390]  And so I had to take advantage.
[02:29.390 --> 02:31.690]  I walked in, walked right to the counter.
[02:31.830 --> 02:34.810]  And I said, give me two of those bad boys and a 32 ounce Budweiser.
[02:35.270 --> 02:42.090]  And I got to say, as the only American of the main three in this podcast,
[02:43.630 --> 02:45.950]  I got to commiserate with Eric.
[02:46.110 --> 02:47.510]  I don't know what it's like in your countries.
[02:47.830 --> 02:51.310]  But if you go to a baseball, any sporting event in America
[02:51.310 --> 02:54.810]  and they have dollar hot dog night, you are legally required
[02:54.810 --> 02:56.730]  as an American to eat at least four.
[02:56.730 --> 02:59.670]  I think I would have gone six or seven, probably, definitely,
[02:59.970 --> 03:01.690]  because how do you say no to that?
[03:01.770 --> 03:04.030]  Is there a Canadian or a British equivalent?
[03:04.650 --> 03:06.590]  I don't know where I would go to watch baseball,
[03:06.950 --> 03:11.010]  but I feel like any any sport, I'd find hot dogs for like eight quid.
[03:11.090 --> 03:14.970]  So I think if there was one there for a pound, I would I would go apeshit on him.
[03:15.290 --> 03:19.490]  So when you go to a Tottenham Hotspurs game, that's your team up in England.
[03:20.490 --> 03:23.510]  And they have like, what do they have?
[03:23.510 --> 03:27.770]  Hot dogs. What's the food at a soccer game or a footy game in England?
[03:28.290 --> 03:32.330]  I used to go for like a burger or kebab outside the stadium to save a bit of money.
[03:32.630 --> 03:35.010]  You get a little cup of Bovril or something if you want.
[03:35.450 --> 03:36.730]  What the fuck is what is what?
[03:37.330 --> 03:38.330]  A little hot Bovril?
[03:39.290 --> 03:40.650]  Well, I don't know what that is.
[03:40.770 --> 03:43.590]  What the fuck? Hot Bovril?
[03:44.650 --> 03:45.450]  Yeah, Bovril.
[03:45.750 --> 03:48.150]  I don't think I could spell that based on how you're saying it.
[03:48.190 --> 03:50.170]  It sounds different every time you say it.
[03:51.030 --> 03:53.210]  I don't know. It's like a...
[03:53.210 --> 03:56.810]  What is Bovril? It's like, it's like...
[03:56.810 --> 03:59.430]  Hey, if you guys had to guess before Gavin tells us, what do you think?
[03:59.470 --> 04:01.630]  What do you think a cup of hot Bovril is?
[04:01.970 --> 04:06.650]  Fantastic. I'm imagining something black, like it's a black gooey.
[04:07.030 --> 04:08.170]  Oh, it's definitely black.
[04:08.670 --> 04:09.870]  OK, I'm on the right.
[04:10.270 --> 04:12.010]  I'm on the right foot here. What about you, Geoff?
[04:12.070 --> 04:13.050]  Do you think it's sweet?
[04:13.590 --> 04:15.310]  I think it's savory. It has to be savory.
[04:15.650 --> 04:17.790]  Is it like some sort of a toddy?
[04:18.450 --> 04:20.810]  Like a like a mulled wine type thing?
[04:20.810 --> 04:23.610]  Or is it more of like you guys boil Vegemite and drink it?
[04:23.890 --> 04:24.930]  I think it's very similar to Vegemite.
[04:25.050 --> 04:27.890]  I think it's like yeast and meat paste liquid.
[04:30.610 --> 04:33.970]  It's like a like, uh, it's like a beefy tea.
[04:35.050 --> 04:38.350]  Everything in your country sounds hideous.
[04:39.150 --> 04:41.150]  Nobody... Hideous! A beefy tea?
[04:41.370 --> 04:44.510]  Oh, Eric's written Bovril is the trademark name of a thick
[04:44.510 --> 04:48.690]  and salty meat extract paste similar to yeast extract.
[04:49.260 --> 04:52.750]  Yeah. So you put you get that and you pour hot water in it.
[04:52.810 --> 04:55.250]  And it's like beef paste tea.
[04:55.630 --> 04:58.430]  I am so sad I guessed that essentially correct.
[04:58.630 --> 05:00.550]  Oh, God, you nailed it.
[05:01.350 --> 05:03.710]  Oh, I mean, isn't that sort of just broth?
[05:03.950 --> 05:05.270]  You're just eating broth.
[05:06.110 --> 05:07.250]  Yeah, it's really good.
[05:07.310 --> 05:10.850]  It warms you up on a nice, you know, cold winter evening.
[05:11.130 --> 05:16.250]  I think we've I think we've bumped that to the top of the list for Andrew to try.
[05:16.250 --> 05:19.530]  Bovril. Yeah, a nice cup of hot Bovril.
[05:20.030 --> 05:24.210]  Do they ever have like one quid Bovril night where people just like down
[05:24.790 --> 05:28.010]  five, six, seven Bovril's and then they're at work the next day going like,
[05:28.150 --> 05:31.670]  Oh, I'm having a bit of a bubble gut from my Bovril.
[05:32.310 --> 05:37.550]  I don't I'm not sure if it's physically possible to spend more than a pound of Bovril.
[05:42.620 --> 05:43.580]  Nine Bovril's.
[05:44.180 --> 05:46.580]  Oh, God, I'm shitting straight paste.
[05:47.420 --> 05:50.420]  I've just Googled it and it says in quotes,
[05:50.820 --> 05:55.040]  this fluid of beef fed an army and makes a hearty tea.
[05:59.710 --> 06:03.390]  I it is it would never ceases to amaze me
[06:03.390 --> 06:07.430]  the off ramps these conversations take that I just don't see coming.
[06:08.030 --> 06:12.270]  I could easily have gone the rest of my life not having ever heard of Bovril.
[06:13.810 --> 06:16.410]  If it weren't for Eric coming in going like,
[06:16.410 --> 06:18.230]  I'm going to be on the toilet most of the episode.
[06:18.890 --> 06:23.890]  I remember it funnily, because when I used to go to my dad's work as a kid,
[06:23.990 --> 06:27.570]  one of the vending machines had Bovril and you could just dispense hot Bovril.
[06:29.250 --> 06:32.010]  I'd be all over that, be my little Bovril spot.
[06:35.990 --> 06:37.590]  Oh, this looks terrible.
[06:41.210 --> 06:42.750]  Oh, fucking gross.
[06:42.870 --> 06:43.730]  How is that real?
[06:43.730 --> 06:50.810]  Oh, what's the Canadian version of a hot dog or Bovril, Andrew?
[06:50.990 --> 06:53.890]  Like when you go to a hockey game, when you go see the Canucks play?
[06:54.030 --> 06:57.130]  I don't I don't feel like there is like all that different
[06:57.130 --> 07:02.530]  of a food experience from Canada to America as far as sporting events goes.
[07:02.950 --> 07:06.650]  I like I've never been to a baseball game as a Canadian.
[07:06.770 --> 07:09.110]  I fantasize about like, I'm going to go to the baseball game.
[07:09.170 --> 07:10.310]  I'm going to get hot dogs.
[07:10.310 --> 07:14.030]  Like when I think about baseball, the experience of the game
[07:14.030 --> 07:16.310]  is very secondary to what I'm excited about.
[07:16.550 --> 07:18.210]  Everything I'm excited about is drinking.
[07:18.390 --> 07:21.850]  You'd be outside, enjoy the sun, eat some hot dogs.
[07:22.070 --> 07:23.390]  So I don't have a Bovril.
[07:23.850 --> 07:25.110]  We wouldn't let Bovril in.
[07:25.290 --> 07:27.950]  I don't I I'm right there with you.
[07:28.010 --> 07:30.650]  I think more than any other professional sport.
[07:30.650 --> 07:34.310]  And I've I think I've been fortunate enough to attend all the main players
[07:35.030 --> 07:36.770]  now that I've been to an F1 game as well.
[07:37.410 --> 07:41.070]  I think more than any other professional sport, a major league baseball game
[07:41.070 --> 07:43.050]  is a day long experience.
[07:43.110 --> 07:46.590]  Yes. Where you take in so much more than the actual game.
[07:46.750 --> 07:50.470]  The game is in some ways secondary to everything else that's going on.
[07:50.570 --> 07:52.710]  And food and drink is a huge part of that.
[07:53.070 --> 07:54.430]  So you like really long games?
[07:55.370 --> 07:58.110]  It may be not on TV, but definitely in person.
[07:58.110 --> 08:00.410]  So you'd like cricket, then like a test match.
[08:00.690 --> 08:02.410]  Oh, what do they eat?
[08:03.790 --> 08:04.690]  I don't know.
[08:04.790 --> 08:07.350]  Usually in the summer, so I probably wouldn't be going for the Bovril.
[08:09.510 --> 08:11.690]  Nice chilled Bovril, frosted Bov.
[08:12.050 --> 08:14.130]  Summer Bov. Bovril on ice.
[08:16.130 --> 08:17.590]  Oh, like a slurpee.
[08:17.850 --> 08:19.490]  Can we do like a slurpee Bovril?
[08:19.890 --> 08:21.290]  A meat slurpee.
[08:23.310 --> 08:24.190]  Bov pops.
[08:27.110 --> 08:28.730]  That's the new f*** Face and Vision.
[08:29.010 --> 08:29.870]  I'm going to freeze.
[08:29.870 --> 08:31.410]  I'm going to freeze meat paste.
[08:31.410 --> 08:32.170]  Bov pops.
[08:32.210 --> 08:33.710]  Oh, I hate it.
[08:34.350 --> 08:35.970]  Cool down while you heat up.
[08:36.190 --> 08:37.890]  I hate it. Like a slurpee or not.
[08:38.010 --> 08:40.670]  I'm a freezy, like a freeze, freeze tube.
[08:40.930 --> 08:44.410]  Oh, just having to like push out the paste.
[08:45.190 --> 08:46.210]  You know what would be funny?
[08:46.330 --> 08:48.130]  If we filled a groan tube
[08:49.330 --> 08:52.250]  with Bovril or some other drink so that when you drink it, it goes...
[08:53.290 --> 08:54.390]  That's what we should do.
[08:54.730 --> 08:56.770]  We should make...
[08:56.770 --> 08:59.850]  We don't have our f***ing groan tubes yet because we can't get them made
[08:59.850 --> 09:01.290]  thanks to the supply chain.
[09:01.530 --> 09:02.870]  So let's combine them.
[09:03.270 --> 09:06.790]  A groan tube that also dispenses drink.
[09:07.490 --> 09:10.870]  I feel like you're thinking of one of those cups, you know, like you tilt over
[09:10.870 --> 09:13.990]  and it would moo like a cow like mug type thing.
[09:14.070 --> 09:15.410]  But it's just the groan tube noise.
[09:15.530 --> 09:17.290]  I think I think this is feasible.
[09:17.850 --> 09:21.170]  If I was a cow and I got liquefied into a hot paste
[09:21.170 --> 09:24.910]  and then the sound that I made when I was alive played when someone drank it,
[09:24.950 --> 09:25.530]  I'd be livid.
[09:26.090 --> 09:28.850]  Can we make the sound just go instead of the traditional sound?
[09:28.850 --> 09:31.010]  Can it just go groooosssssss?
[09:33.630 --> 09:34.070]  Groooosssssss.
[09:34.090 --> 09:35.050]  Every time you drink it.
[09:35.330 --> 09:37.910]  I'm excited to drink a nice hot Bovril out of the new...
[09:39.410 --> 09:39.850]  GERPLER.
[09:41.570 --> 09:44.150]  Can you imagine a liter of Bovril?
[09:44.550 --> 09:47.010]  Oh, God. Like a full meal.
[09:48.510 --> 09:50.970]  How many calories would be in a liter of Bovril?
[09:51.590 --> 09:53.070]  It's like a third of a cow, probably.
[09:53.470 --> 09:54.830]  I'm blown away that I've...
[09:54.830 --> 09:58.250]  Geoff, I've known you for, you know, the better part of a decade
[09:58.250 --> 10:00.110]  and a half, two decades, and we've never talked about Bovril.
[10:00.110 --> 10:01.830]  The better part of your life, buddy. Yeah.
[10:02.550 --> 10:05.530]  We've known each other more than half of your life at this point.
[10:06.710 --> 10:09.530]  And we've never discussed Bovril.
[10:09.870 --> 10:11.630]  Not once. Thank God.
[10:11.730 --> 10:12.530]  Thank God it was today.
[10:12.890 --> 10:13.810]  So who's the co-worker?
[10:14.490 --> 10:15.330]  That's a great question.
[10:15.810 --> 10:17.050]  Maybe the audience can figure it out.
[10:17.550 --> 10:19.170]  What else do you guys want to talk about today?
[10:19.210 --> 10:19.950]  What do you got going on?
[10:20.250 --> 10:21.550]  I have a question for Andrew.
[10:21.910 --> 10:24.010]  Oh, OK. I'm excited.
[10:24.350 --> 10:25.270]  What are you doing?
[10:29.350 --> 10:31.370]  Like in this moment or...
[10:31.370 --> 10:36.470]  No, no, just in general, what have you done to it?
[10:37.750 --> 10:39.290]  I don't know what that means.
[10:39.910 --> 10:41.250]  You're putting shit...
[10:41.250 --> 10:43.790]  Look, I'll get a review cut, right?
[10:44.270 --> 10:45.470]  It's not the final cut.
[10:45.610 --> 10:47.070]  You've been adding shit to it.
[10:47.130 --> 10:48.970]  You've been putting shit on after I get to it.
[10:49.650 --> 10:50.450]  What's the beginning?
[10:51.050 --> 10:52.650]  What's happened to the beginning of f***face?
[10:53.050 --> 10:54.010]  We've talked about it.
[10:54.110 --> 10:55.510]  It's previously on.
[10:55.690 --> 10:57.310]  It's a previously on voice.
[10:58.250 --> 10:59.210]  Yeah, but who is it?
[10:59.470 --> 11:03.110]  Well, that's what I figured would be a great mystery for you to find out.
[11:03.270 --> 11:07.590]  I thought, I don't know, maybe we could do like a thing where you could ask a question, an episode or something about...
[11:07.590 --> 11:09.890]  Oh, OK. Can I ask the first question?
[11:10.110 --> 11:10.870]  Can I ask the first question?
[11:11.010 --> 11:11.630]  Go ahead. Right now?
[11:11.990 --> 11:12.930]  Yeah. Who's the voice?
[11:13.510 --> 11:14.590]  I can't say that.
[11:14.830 --> 11:16.890]  It's a... that's a bullshit game, Geoff.
[11:16.990 --> 11:18.570]  That's like asking a genie for more wishes.
[11:18.770 --> 11:20.050]  That doesn't count. It's illegal.
[11:20.150 --> 11:23.650]  We were in the airport getting our luggage as part of our tour.
[11:23.650 --> 11:30.950]  And minor league fan Jack walked up to both of us and was like, who does the previously on voice on f***face?
[11:31.170 --> 11:32.670]  And Geoff and I were like, huh?
[11:33.110 --> 11:38.910]  Because I just, you know, I just approved the first cut of the episode where there was no previously on voice, Andrew.
[11:39.450 --> 11:41.270]  And I was like, huh?
[11:41.350 --> 11:43.550]  And I had to listen to the version that came out.
[11:44.070 --> 11:46.810]  Geoff and I listened to it and we were just like, looking at each other like, what?
[11:47.710 --> 11:51.670]  And then I started writing out a slack being like, does anyone like, how did this...
[11:51.670 --> 11:54.270]  And then I realized this is a question for content.
[11:54.710 --> 11:59.610]  I'm not going to waste this over slack, but it sounds like Andrew's not going to tell us.
[12:00.170 --> 12:01.970]  No, it's the whole mystery.
[12:02.290 --> 12:03.730]  I already established this.
[12:04.090 --> 12:05.210]  This is long established.
[12:05.370 --> 12:07.150]  It's not my fault. We talked about this before.
[12:07.350 --> 12:12.550]  I wanted to bring in the variety guy to do the voice and that didn't pan out.
[12:12.610 --> 12:14.250]  So I kept at it and...
[12:14.250 --> 12:19.710]  I do remember your idea being to have, you know, previously on f***face, but it's the entire episode.
[12:19.710 --> 12:22.530]  Yes, it's just confusing.
[12:22.730 --> 12:26.430]  It's really more of a currently, presently happening on f***face.
[12:26.890 --> 12:28.430]  Yeah, exactly.
[12:29.030 --> 12:32.550]  So I was just, I was interested to see if you two could figure out who it is.
[12:32.590 --> 12:35.330]  It's somebody, I'll say it's someone in the universe of the show.
[12:35.850 --> 12:37.370]  I didn't just pull a random person.
[12:38.050 --> 12:40.830]  Everyone's aware of this person and they're in our universe.
[12:41.290 --> 12:42.810]  Is it the same person every episode?
[12:43.310 --> 12:45.030]  It's yes. Yes, it is.
[12:45.430 --> 12:49.590]  OK, well, my question, Michael, I already used my question for the week.
[12:49.590 --> 12:52.150]  So Gavin, do you want to take one question?
[12:54.070 --> 12:55.990]  Yeah, what do I want to know that he's going to answer, though?
[12:56.450 --> 12:58.570]  I will say I'd love to hear Eric's input.
[12:58.750 --> 13:00.830]  Eric is the only other person who knows who it is.
[13:01.150 --> 13:02.730]  OK, well, let me ask you this then.
[13:03.230 --> 13:04.870]  OK, can I have a hint?
[13:06.190 --> 13:07.930]  I feel like I already gave a hint.
[13:07.950 --> 13:11.410]  I was going to say, I think you already got the hint with it's someone in the universe.
[13:11.730 --> 13:12.250]  I feel like.
[13:12.510 --> 13:16.250]  So it's the variety guy or it's the director of the tuxedo or it's.
[13:16.610 --> 13:18.770]  I mean, he already said it's not the variety guy, right?
[13:18.770 --> 13:20.490]  Oh, so it's the director of the tuxedo.
[13:20.590 --> 13:22.750]  That was fast. Is that your official guess?
[13:23.410 --> 13:25.230]  Is it the director of the tuxedo?
[13:27.370 --> 13:30.370]  No. So we get one guest per episode, one guest per episode.
[13:30.710 --> 13:32.650]  Brilliant. We'll see how long it takes.
[13:32.770 --> 13:33.590]  I think you take a while.
[13:34.130 --> 13:35.850]  I'm excited for this to all be over.
[13:36.190 --> 13:38.970]  I accidentally revealed who it is to Eric because I'm an idiot.
[13:39.150 --> 13:40.730]  And that'll be fun to talk about. We get to the end.
[13:41.370 --> 13:42.970]  I thought that Eric was genius
[13:44.710 --> 13:47.770]  when I said to him, I'm just dumb.
[13:47.770 --> 13:48.910]  It's a dumb mistake.
[13:49.510 --> 13:50.770]  I was nervous, though, Gavin.
[13:50.850 --> 13:52.130]  I didn't know what you're talking about.
[13:52.190 --> 13:52.830]  It's like, what do you mean?
[13:53.210 --> 13:53.810]  What have I done?
[13:54.570 --> 13:58.350]  Did you now is I guess I can't ask any more questions till next week.
[13:58.690 --> 13:59.850]  Damn it. I have so many questions.
[14:00.030 --> 14:00.970]  OK, next week.
[14:01.430 --> 14:02.370]  I have an ongoing bet.
[14:02.450 --> 14:05.090]  It would be really funny if you if one of you would have just guessed it
[14:05.090 --> 14:06.930]  immediately, I would have ruined everything.
[14:07.090 --> 14:09.010]  All of my plans, everything out the window.
[14:09.390 --> 14:10.510]  No point for it.
[14:11.890 --> 14:13.170]  Who have we talked about?
[14:13.870 --> 14:14.750]  So many people.
[14:14.750 --> 14:15.950]  We've talked about a lot of people.
[14:16.790 --> 14:17.650]  A lot of discussion.
[14:17.650 --> 14:19.590]  I think maybe you should go over the Kenan and Kel rap.
[14:19.710 --> 14:21.610]  There's a lot of people there just even within that.
[14:23.410 --> 14:24.710]  Well, most people in that dead.
[14:24.890 --> 14:26.070]  So that's true.
[14:26.490 --> 14:29.010]  But that would be one hell of a pull if I got that.
[14:29.330 --> 14:33.270]  Is that a thing where if Kenan and Kel rap about you, you will die soon?
[14:33.750 --> 14:34.490]  No, I don't think so.
[14:35.390 --> 14:36.750]  I was a kid and didn't do the rap.
[14:36.850 --> 14:37.350]  It's cool. Yeah.
[14:37.870 --> 14:38.530]  Oh, yeah, that's true.
[14:38.590 --> 14:38.970]  I don't know.
[14:39.370 --> 14:40.670]  I'm not of your generation.
[14:42.090 --> 14:44.890]  We have talked about it like six times on the show, though.
[14:45.330 --> 14:47.150]  Yeah, whatever. Regardless of generation.
[14:49.270 --> 14:51.650]  If you got Coolio to do it, it would be amazing.
[14:52.030 --> 14:53.270]  It would. That would be really cool.
[14:53.410 --> 14:55.010]  Does not sound like Coolio.
[14:55.630 --> 14:58.370]  What if I'm not going to give anything away?
[15:01.370 --> 15:04.770]  Well, let's try it and finish this episode because we're double recording today
[15:04.770 --> 15:06.950]  so I can ask another question in 45 minutes.
[15:07.790 --> 15:09.790]  Oh, yeah. I'm going to start preparing my next guess.
[15:11.470 --> 15:14.030]  So last time we recorded one of these,
[15:14.030 --> 15:16.670]  we were very proud of ourselves that we tied up a lot of loose ends
[15:16.670 --> 15:18.090]  that we're like, we did it.
[15:18.170 --> 15:19.190]  We're typically so bad.
[15:19.270 --> 15:21.110]  We set things up. We forget about them.
[15:21.630 --> 15:22.210]  We move through.
[15:22.370 --> 15:23.570]  Yeah, we did baseballs.
[15:23.610 --> 15:24.470]  We did Beanhole.
[15:24.830 --> 15:25.770]  We did a lot of stuff.
[15:25.810 --> 15:26.150]  Gerpler.
[15:26.450 --> 15:27.710]  We're all excited about it.
[15:27.750 --> 15:28.550]  We miss one thing.
[15:29.190 --> 15:31.390]  We miss one thing that is important.
[15:31.530 --> 15:32.350]  It's a vital thing.
[15:33.410 --> 15:36.390]  I was going to say what the item of clothing Gavin had to wear was.
[15:36.810 --> 15:39.590]  Yeah, I'm really glad you missed it, because now every podcast I'm on,
[15:40.070 --> 15:43.050]  everyone's just screaming at me that I'm not wearing 64 pieces of clothes.
[15:43.610 --> 15:44.710]  Well, we all forgot it.
[15:44.730 --> 15:46.450]  I don't think that's fully my fault.
[15:46.570 --> 15:49.070]  We were all we threw like a fucking parade of we did it.
[15:49.190 --> 15:50.050]  We covered everything
[15:51.250 --> 15:52.530]  and we just missed it.
[15:52.590 --> 15:54.450]  So this is I'm going to put in the group chat right now.
[15:54.510 --> 15:54.970]  Link to it.
[15:55.110 --> 15:56.410]  We well, what?
[15:56.790 --> 15:58.110]  We're all part of the show.
[15:58.910 --> 16:00.090]  Yeah, but you're the one coming up with it.
[16:00.610 --> 16:01.030]  That's fair.
[16:01.070 --> 16:04.050]  But in my defense, also, I wanted to collaborate with Geoff on it.
[16:04.130 --> 16:05.210]  So that was that was sort of the idea.
[16:05.250 --> 16:07.430]  He didn't. He didn't collaborate with me.
[16:07.670 --> 16:10.350]  Is it because he's a co-worker and it was outside of hours?
[16:11.530 --> 16:14.050]  Hmm. I strongly disagree with this take by Geoff.
[16:14.490 --> 16:15.250]  It was open.
[16:15.450 --> 16:17.070]  I said, I want him to send me some stuff.
[16:17.110 --> 16:18.250]  He was like, I think that's perfect.
[16:18.310 --> 16:19.150]  I said, I'm one thing.
[16:19.290 --> 16:20.350]  He's like, I think that's good.
[16:20.370 --> 16:21.330]  So we're going to go with the thing.
[16:21.650 --> 16:23.850]  Oh, I did. Like, is that the thing? I did like it.
[16:23.950 --> 16:25.290]  You know, that's what I just assumed.
[16:25.470 --> 16:27.370]  Yeah, there's no other discourse about it.
[16:27.530 --> 16:29.310]  I mean, there are other suggestions that were sent.
[16:29.370 --> 16:30.410]  I thought it was on brand.
[16:30.730 --> 16:32.470]  This is the one item I'm suggesting.
[16:32.550 --> 16:34.690]  Just the hat doesn't have to be the tie.
[16:34.910 --> 16:35.710]  You want to do the tie?
[16:36.250 --> 16:36.810]  That's fine.
[16:37.490 --> 16:38.390]  Just the headpiece.
[16:38.390 --> 16:42.630]  Although I wouldn't say no to an additional tie to go with all my ties.
[16:43.750 --> 16:45.050]  The headpiece is my pick.
[16:45.350 --> 16:47.770]  There were a lot of people were really mean.
[16:47.970 --> 16:50.110]  Yeah, there's some terrible suggestions.
[16:50.670 --> 16:51.170]  People are terrible.
[16:51.330 --> 16:52.110]  It's so hot.
[16:52.250 --> 16:54.390]  And that thing looks like shit. You don't know what I rejected.
[16:54.950 --> 16:56.630]  People wanted straight jackets.
[16:56.970 --> 16:58.250]  People wanted wetsuits.
[16:59.030 --> 16:59.890]  Like there were some... Like clothing.
[17:00.230 --> 17:01.630]  It's like handcuffs being clothing.
[17:03.570 --> 17:05.090]  I think handcuffs are an accessory.
[17:05.650 --> 17:07.390]  I wanted to put you in a sandwich board
[17:07.390 --> 17:08.610]  that says Geoff is awesome.
[17:08.630 --> 17:08.990]  Thank you, Eric.
[17:09.030 --> 17:09.990]  How am I going to sit down?
[17:10.390 --> 17:10.870]  You won't.
[17:14.930 --> 17:16.290]  So I didn't want to be too mean.
[17:16.530 --> 17:18.330]  I just wanted I wanted something on brand.
[17:18.490 --> 17:19.570]  I thought it connected well.
[17:20.170 --> 17:22.010]  There are all sorts of angles we could have went.
[17:22.150 --> 17:23.410]  Sandwich board idea is very funny.
[17:24.330 --> 17:28.290]  I mean, technically, like a mascot outfit is a singular piece of clothing,
[17:28.330 --> 17:29.590]  depending on how it's designed.
[17:30.330 --> 17:32.010]  Yeah, you don't want to cover up all the other clothes, though.
[17:32.410 --> 17:35.070]  I mean, if there was if we had this talk before, I would have seen
[17:35.070 --> 17:38.610]  if I could get like a giant Bovril suit, just like a mascot
[17:38.610 --> 17:41.190]  foam bottle of Bovril that you have to work through.
[17:41.850 --> 17:44.590]  But if Bovril wants to sponsor my appearance on that podcast,
[17:44.790 --> 17:45.890]  I'd be open to it.
[17:46.370 --> 17:50.410]  So then, Gavin, you have to wear the Donkey Kong hat
[17:51.010 --> 17:53.810]  or headpiece and 63 other pieces of clothing.
[17:53.930 --> 17:55.490]  Is that how this shakes out of your choice?
[17:55.570 --> 17:57.010]  That's how it shakes out. Yeah. Yeah. OK.
[17:57.490 --> 17:58.510]  I'm excited to see what you do.
[17:59.050 --> 18:01.750]  The audience cut Gavin some slack.
[18:01.810 --> 18:04.650]  He can't put the Donkey Kong hat on until it comes in the mail.
[18:04.650 --> 18:06.770]  So, yeah, it's going to take some time. It'll take some.
[18:06.950 --> 18:09.330]  Oh, yeah. I want to get this out of the way as soon as I can.
[18:09.790 --> 18:10.830]  So it's such a pleasure.
[18:11.450 --> 18:14.510]  I like that it's just getting 10 degrees hotter in Texas
[18:14.510 --> 18:16.030]  every week that you don't do this.
[18:16.410 --> 18:18.510]  Oh, I didn't know.
[18:19.150 --> 18:19.830]  That's great.
[18:20.510 --> 18:23.530]  Can we talk about I wasn't even going to necessarily bring this up,
[18:23.570 --> 18:25.350]  but we're talking about Bovril sponsoring.
[18:25.550 --> 18:29.290]  I found a sponsorship opportunity for us that I'm very excited about.
[18:29.870 --> 18:32.030]  I don't think there's any way it will happen.
[18:32.030 --> 18:34.470]  But like spawning events and sponsorship.
[18:34.890 --> 18:39.870]  I was reading the news the other day and I saw this story that was like
[18:40.430 --> 18:42.570]  the Nima Buccaneers have a new owner.
[18:42.750 --> 18:45.330]  I'm like, who the fuck are the Buccaneers?
[18:45.630 --> 18:46.690]  I've lived here my whole life.
[18:46.750 --> 18:47.790]  I've never heard of the Buccaneers.
[18:48.150 --> 18:49.530]  They're a junior hockey team.
[18:50.210 --> 18:51.330]  I guess they just sold.
[18:51.710 --> 18:53.810]  They won one game last year.
[18:54.730 --> 18:56.810]  They lost. They played 48.
[18:57.150 --> 18:58.530]  They had one win.
[18:59.050 --> 19:02.750]  Oh, I'd love to know how much that team sold for.
[19:04.790 --> 19:08.350]  It was purchased by, I guess, like people moving to the area.
[19:08.450 --> 19:12.950]  Anyway, they have a sponsorship opportunities tab on their website.
[19:13.190 --> 19:16.470]  And so I was looking through because I kind of want to get fully invested
[19:16.470 --> 19:18.650]  in the Nima Buccaneers for their next season,
[19:18.690 --> 19:20.750]  just to see if they can get two wins.
[19:21.030 --> 19:22.150]  I'm all about two wins.
[19:22.650 --> 19:25.750]  So I was considering and I thought I could run it by you guys.
[19:26.430 --> 19:30.990]  One of these sponsorship packages to see if we can officially get sponsored
[19:30.990 --> 19:33.190]  or sponsor sponsorship opportunities.
[19:34.130 --> 19:38.670]  Now, a lot of them are sold out, but there are some good ones like the face off.
[19:39.110 --> 19:41.450]  There is a let me scroll down.
[19:41.790 --> 19:43.670]  Oh, dude, these are affordable.
[19:44.050 --> 19:45.110]  They're very affordable.
[19:45.590 --> 19:47.210]  Yeah, there's some good ones.
[19:47.790 --> 19:50.090]  I think the opening face off is a strong one.
[19:50.250 --> 19:55.130]  And I'm assuming it's for the season and not a game based on the premise of sold out.
[19:55.130 --> 19:57.650]  Helmet, seven hundred and fifty dollars.
[19:57.870 --> 19:59.230]  How do we put face?
[19:59.790 --> 20:00.870]  Eric brings up a good point.
[20:00.990 --> 20:03.110]  How do we put face on a junior hockey team?
[20:03.550 --> 20:04.410]  That's the hurdle.
[20:04.550 --> 20:07.110]  I could see them being very resistant to that.
[20:07.210 --> 20:11.030]  But I do like the idea of this opening face off is brought to you by face.
[20:11.210 --> 20:12.510]  Opening face off.
[20:12.850 --> 20:18.410]  Oh, what if it's what if it's uniform or the Gurpler itself?
[20:18.570 --> 20:19.850]  Dude, uniform.
[20:20.710 --> 20:23.670]  That is. Well, OK, I thought about that.
[20:23.670 --> 20:26.290]  And then I thought it was funnier if it was face.
[20:27.130 --> 20:33.470]  But there is something to be said if we like Trojan horse face in through uniform.
[20:33.710 --> 20:37.410]  Yeah, just if they if they if they shut down face immediately,
[20:38.350 --> 20:40.030]  because why wouldn't they?
[20:40.370 --> 20:42.110]  Then we should be prepared for a backup.
[20:42.310 --> 20:44.910]  I guess the problem I didn't really think about this.
[20:44.990 --> 20:48.910]  If we do the face off, they have to say fuck at the start of every game.
[20:49.190 --> 20:50.410]  There's no way around it.
[20:50.930 --> 20:54.090]  I'm so I'm so used to our censorship.
[20:54.830 --> 20:56.490]  Oh, we could send it to Ericsson.
[20:56.550 --> 20:57.250]  They can bleep it.
[20:57.350 --> 20:59.010]  That's we could send them one of our buttons.
[20:59.250 --> 21:02.910]  They could push the button at the same time they say it.
[21:04.690 --> 21:05.870]  We could sponsor this.
[21:05.870 --> 21:10.070]  But you have to update your audio system system to use it.
[21:10.870 --> 21:11.910]  We will not pay for that.
[21:12.450 --> 21:15.610]  But we will pay for the opening opening face off.
[21:15.870 --> 21:19.650]  Yeah, I guess face is even less viable than I considered because in my head,
[21:19.650 --> 21:21.190]  it's always the hmm.
[21:21.810 --> 21:24.370]  So we might have to go uniform, but I'd like to.
[21:24.510 --> 21:24.750]  I don't know.
[21:24.830 --> 21:27.150]  I thought this would be a funny thing to get invested in.
[21:27.470 --> 21:29.350]  I'm blown away at how much is sold out.
[21:29.570 --> 21:32.490]  There's a lot of stuff you can't get, like the jersey, the shoulder patch,
[21:32.930 --> 21:35.070]  the pants shell, whatever that is.
[21:35.550 --> 21:39.550]  I feel like I feel like it has to be the opening face off
[21:39.550 --> 21:42.370]  because I don't think the logo on the helmet would be that big.
[21:42.870 --> 21:46.510]  But for the announcer to be like this face off is brought to you by uniform
[21:46.510 --> 21:48.650]  or whatever, I think it's very funny.
[21:49.150 --> 21:50.170]  Oh, my God.
[21:50.690 --> 21:52.430]  Can we make him say the full spiel, too?
[21:52.750 --> 21:55.450]  Like this face off is brought to you by uniform, uniform
[21:55.450 --> 21:57.350]  combining the power of one with the fabric of the form.
[21:57.670 --> 22:00.150]  Uniform. Go! Or however you start off.
[22:00.410 --> 22:01.690]  You start a hockey game with go?
[22:01.750 --> 22:03.850]  You start a hockey game by yelling go?
[22:13.560 --> 22:15.520]  I'm so for this idea.
[22:15.680 --> 22:16.380]  I love this idea.
[22:16.920 --> 22:17.180]  Same.
[22:17.660 --> 22:19.120]  And I can't believe the prices.
[22:19.120 --> 22:22.460]  Yeah, I was so excited about it because like I clicked it thinking like,
[22:22.620 --> 22:25.540]  Oh, this is going to be way out of our price range.
[22:25.640 --> 22:29.140]  But it feels viable, feels like a thing we could do.
[22:29.420 --> 22:32.060]  Let me see if I can pull up the record for the league,
[22:32.500 --> 22:35.880]  their league standings from the regular season of this year.
[22:36.400 --> 22:40.200]  OK, Nanaimo Buccaneers, 48 games played, one win,
[22:41.160 --> 22:45.360]  43 losses in regulation, three losses in overtime,
[22:46.020 --> 22:47.320]  one shootout loss.
[22:49.180 --> 22:51.880]  Isn't this kind of how the Mighty Ducks started, though?
[22:52.000 --> 22:55.020]  Like we're one Emilio Estevez away from being a kick-ass team.
[22:56.460 --> 23:00.700]  So they got some crowd advertising to an average attendance
[23:00.700 --> 23:02.840]  of 400 to 600 people.
[23:03.100 --> 23:04.340]  That's more people to listen to this podcast.
[23:08.000 --> 23:09.260]  I would love to.
[23:09.520 --> 23:13.300]  Hmm. I guess they'd never find us because of uniform, but it would be
[23:13.300 --> 23:17.480]  how many if we could do f***face, do you think we'd convert two people
[23:17.480 --> 23:19.220]  into listening? Yes.
[23:19.560 --> 23:23.340]  Like at least that would be that should be our our our goal for return
[23:23.340 --> 23:27.480]  on investment is we should pay $1,500 to acquire two listeners.
[23:32.400 --> 23:36.220]  And just to like to put into perspective, so they got six points,
[23:36.300 --> 23:40.220]  so they got two points for a win and then four one points
[23:40.220 --> 23:41.460]  for the overtime losses.
[23:41.720 --> 23:45.260]  The second to worst team in the league had 33 points.
[23:45.760 --> 23:46.900]  It's 16 wins.
[23:46.900 --> 23:47.640]  There's a gap.
[23:47.800 --> 23:51.660]  There's a large gap between them and even the like the next worst team.
[23:51.980 --> 23:54.580]  Oh, this is can we see a game while we're there?
[23:55.040 --> 23:57.080]  I'd love to. I don't know when their schedule is.
[23:57.120 --> 23:58.360]  I need to look more into that.
[23:58.500 --> 24:02.380]  I'm going to maybe depending on what time is crabbing in the morning and
[24:02.380 --> 24:06.560]  and then we'll celebrate with some bagels.
[24:06.900 --> 24:09.760]  Oh, I really I really like this.
[24:09.980 --> 24:13.820]  If you can get that schedule, maybe we can plan our trip around that schedule.
[24:14.060 --> 24:14.980]  Their their hockey schedule.
[24:15.220 --> 24:16.380]  Absolutely. I'll look into that.
[24:16.380 --> 24:17.800]  But I should I should talk about bagels.
[24:18.260 --> 24:19.300]  Please talk about bagels.
[24:19.360 --> 24:21.280]  I've been I don't know about Gavin, but I've been waiting
[24:22.020 --> 24:23.420]  for all week to hear about this.
[24:23.480 --> 24:25.640]  I don't know how much Gavin knows about bagels.
[24:25.700 --> 24:27.520]  I know, you know, a little bit more, Geoff.
[24:27.620 --> 24:29.460]  This is this has been I need to thank.
[24:29.580 --> 24:30.340]  Let me pull up my notes.
[24:30.340 --> 24:34.400]  First of all, I need to thank Jimmy, Jenny Almond specifically
[24:34.400 --> 24:37.140]  because she accidentally put all of this into motion.
[24:37.340 --> 24:40.500]  So last we left off, I talked about I accidentally followed them
[24:40.500 --> 24:43.380]  on the pod account and I started following them.
[24:43.900 --> 24:48.300]  And they had 23 followers at the time, I believe, on Twitter.
[24:49.340 --> 24:52.720]  And I was like, oh, man, I hope they fall back or something happens.
[24:54.700 --> 24:58.760]  Earlier last week, I got a DM from Jenny and she was like,
[24:58.800 --> 25:01.100]  hey, I emailed them and told them about the show
[25:01.100 --> 25:03.940]  because I was curious if there was anything I could buy.
[25:04.120 --> 25:07.840]  Like I live in America, like if there's a way I could support them in some way.
[25:08.140 --> 25:11.060]  And so I just talked to him and I thought, oh, shit, like they have
[25:11.060 --> 25:13.080]  somebody is now interacted with them.
[25:13.360 --> 25:15.040]  That is from the audience.
[25:15.220 --> 25:20.140]  Like they now are absolutely aware that we exist in some capacity.
[25:20.480 --> 25:25.140]  Yeah, it's I guess it's great in based on all of your previous
[25:25.140 --> 25:27.360]  correspondence and all of as a podcast.
[25:27.460 --> 25:29.580]  I'm terrified now. I'm terrified of where it goes from here.
[25:29.900 --> 25:31.520]  Absolutely. Well, I was nervous.
[25:31.600 --> 25:33.340]  It's like, well, did you think they would listen?
[25:33.640 --> 25:35.100]  Do you think they just like looked at?
[25:35.320 --> 25:36.780]  I don't know. What would they do?
[25:36.780 --> 25:37.940]  Because now they know they're mentioned.
[25:37.940 --> 25:42.300]  And then that evening they followed the Facebook Twitter account.
[25:42.340 --> 25:44.200]  And I was so excited.
[25:44.320 --> 25:45.120]  Then they followed me.
[25:45.560 --> 25:48.720]  It's the most excited I've been to get any notification ever.
[25:48.720 --> 25:51.880]  I was losing my mind that I got on my hubby's bagel follow.
[25:52.140 --> 25:54.580]  Then they DM the podcast account.
[25:54.820 --> 25:59.600]  And I was I was too starstruck and nervous to reply that evening.
[25:59.780 --> 26:03.660]  It felt I don't know if you've seen the movie Swingers, you know,
[26:03.700 --> 26:05.920]  like when Jon Favreau gets the number and they're all like,
[26:05.940 --> 26:07.300]  you got to wait two days to reply.
[26:07.300 --> 26:08.540]  You can't seem overeager.
[26:08.820 --> 26:10.560]  Like Heather Graham's number, right?
[26:10.900 --> 26:12.260]  I think so. Yeah. Yeah.
[26:12.320 --> 26:14.880]  In the movie, I had that experience where it was just like,
[26:14.960 --> 26:17.640]  I'm too excited about this to like actually reply
[26:17.640 --> 26:19.480]  because they wrote a super sweet message.
[26:19.660 --> 26:21.380]  They had never heard of the show.
[26:21.680 --> 26:25.240]  They had no concept of our awareness or roosterteeth existence.
[26:25.880 --> 26:27.820]  They're very confused by all of it.
[26:27.960 --> 26:29.720]  But in like a nice way.
[26:30.200 --> 26:33.560]  So then we started going back and forth and we've become like friends
[26:33.560 --> 26:35.740]  over like the past two weeks or texting.
[26:35.740 --> 26:37.000]  It's been great.
[26:37.240 --> 26:40.420]  And it's been very we've talked about how this is a show
[26:40.420 --> 26:42.340]  that is a deep lore about nothing.
[26:42.580 --> 26:46.480]  And I've never had to try to explain some of that lore
[26:46.480 --> 26:48.880]  to somebody completely removed from it.
[26:48.960 --> 26:50.560]  And boy, has it been a time.
[26:50.740 --> 26:53.300]  Just like a normal person, a normal member of society.
[26:53.340 --> 26:54.460]  Yes, a normal.
[26:54.680 --> 26:57.640]  It is so hard because somebody I tweeted about it.
[26:57.640 --> 26:59.860]  And so it replied like, I guess I should.
[26:59.920 --> 27:00.640]  I'm going out of order here.
[27:00.940 --> 27:04.740]  They they said that I will get to name a regulation bagel.
[27:04.740 --> 27:08.460]  So I'll get to come up with a name for a bagel and it'll be the regulation bagel.
[27:08.560 --> 27:11.400]  It'll be something that anybody can get if they go into the store.
[27:11.480 --> 27:12.440]  They can order the regulation.
[27:12.520 --> 27:15.560]  You're saying the name of the bagel is the regulation bagel?
[27:15.560 --> 27:18.680]  It's well, I'm still working out the specifics of it.
[27:18.860 --> 27:22.460]  I think what is going to being is like a menu item that you could like
[27:22.460 --> 27:24.600]  if you're a fan of the show and you go to my hubby's bagels,
[27:24.640 --> 27:26.480]  you can order the regulation bagel.
[27:26.540 --> 27:28.800]  They will know what it means and it will be a specific thing.
[27:29.060 --> 27:31.720]  It's like it's even better than being on the on the board.
[27:31.820 --> 27:33.740]  It's like it's like a secret menu item.
[27:33.740 --> 27:34.900]  That's exactly it.
[27:34.960 --> 27:36.520]  It's sort of I think we're leaning is the secret.
[27:36.860 --> 27:39.220]  That was such a funny because they said that.
[27:39.460 --> 27:44.780]  And then a few days went by and the person Drew, who I was talking to,
[27:44.840 --> 27:48.980]  his name is Drew, which is very funny, was like, yeah, I'm kind of
[27:48.980 --> 27:53.280]  I'm trying to struggling to figure out like how to incorporate regulation
[27:53.760 --> 27:56.440]  into this into this menu I'm working on.
[27:56.720 --> 27:59.560]  And I was like, oh, you know, that's that's fine.
[27:59.760 --> 28:02.280]  Like, I would be so much happier
[28:02.280 --> 28:05.340]  if you had a menu that you were excited about and fully happy with
[28:05.340 --> 28:08.580]  than you trying to shoehorn regulation in if you don't see a fit.
[28:09.020 --> 28:11.040]  Like, just do it like makes you happy.
[28:11.340 --> 28:14.020]  And he's like, yeah, I'm not having a hard time with the regulation.
[28:14.260 --> 28:17.260]  It's trying to get face on there that I'm struggling with.
[28:18.500 --> 28:20.380]  And I was like, no, you don't have to.
[28:21.740 --> 28:25.760]  Nobody, nobody expected it to be called the face regulation bagel.
[28:26.060 --> 28:27.060]  You don't need to do that.
[28:27.260 --> 28:28.560]  We just move on from that.
[28:29.480 --> 28:31.120]  Just regulation bagels. Great.
[28:31.120 --> 28:32.140]  And then we came up.
[28:32.540 --> 28:36.360]  Yeah, we should make a clip that like don't pivot your own business.
[28:36.480 --> 28:37.900]  We'll bend to you. Yeah.
[28:37.980 --> 28:38.700]  You don't need to work.
[28:38.820 --> 28:41.040]  We don't even say our own name. It's fine.
[28:42.400 --> 28:45.120]  So then like trying to I always have to feel like when you start
[28:45.120 --> 28:48.020]  this conversations explaining why we're called what we're called.
[28:48.180 --> 28:51.340]  And then somebody replied to you and they said that I could name a bagel.
[28:51.800 --> 28:55.100]  Someone was like, Andrew's going to salad cream these bagels.
[28:55.300 --> 28:58.940]  And then they replied, I should really learn what that means
[28:58.940 --> 29:00.480]  before I let him into my store.
[29:03.600 --> 29:05.340]  And I'm like, that sounds terrible.
[29:05.740 --> 29:08.960]  So then I had to explain to a normal person
[29:09.580 --> 29:13.000]  what salad creamed means and how it makes sense.
[29:13.140 --> 29:14.920]  It's like trying to teach a different language.
[29:15.780 --> 29:16.520]  Yeah, I like that.
[29:16.580 --> 29:20.500]  You're having to explain what salad creaming as a verb means.
[29:20.500 --> 29:22.140]  Yeah. Not what salad cream.
[29:22.860 --> 29:27.020]  We need we need a handy face pocket dictionary that we can give out.
[29:27.020 --> 29:28.760]  Yeah, we do to help translate.
[29:29.160 --> 29:30.340]  We need a factionary.
[29:30.780 --> 29:32.680]  So I had to explain that.
[29:33.360 --> 29:34.140]  And then there was a time.
[29:34.400 --> 29:38.580]  So they're getting ready to open and then all of their burners.
[29:38.680 --> 29:40.200]  There's something wrong with their burners.
[29:40.220 --> 29:42.040]  And like the electrical wasn't going as planned.
[29:42.200 --> 29:43.800]  So they couldn't make bagels.
[29:44.000 --> 29:46.580]  And they learned this while they were like preparing to open.
[29:46.840 --> 29:49.800]  So it seemed like there was there's a window of time in which it
[29:49.800 --> 29:52.920]  it seemed like they were going to have to open up without the ability
[29:52.920 --> 29:54.120]  to cook or make bagels.
[29:54.120 --> 29:57.560]  So they would be a bagel shop that couldn't sell bagels.
[29:57.680 --> 29:58.900]  And I'm like, you guys, perfect.
[29:59.380 --> 30:02.360]  This is the greatest like phase integration ever.
[30:02.560 --> 30:05.420]  A bagel shop that can't make or sell bagels.
[30:05.640 --> 30:06.920]  We're all about this.
[30:08.080 --> 30:09.900]  They luckily they figured it out.
[30:10.140 --> 30:12.300]  So I explained they're like, so what does salad cream mean?
[30:12.340 --> 30:13.560]  And I'm like, salad cream.
[30:13.640 --> 30:16.940]  It's sort of is like when you screw up an anticipated moment.
[30:17.060 --> 30:20.360]  And they immediately replied, I guess we salad creamed our opening.
[30:20.580 --> 30:22.660]  And I'm like, yeah, that's perfect.
[30:24.660 --> 30:25.840]  Oh, my God.
[30:26.160 --> 30:29.420]  It's inadvertently you found the perfect people.
[30:29.660 --> 30:32.480]  What great sort of unwritten partnership.
[30:32.840 --> 30:33.780]  They're they're incredible.
[30:34.160 --> 30:37.220]  They've been so sweet and their food is absurd.
[30:37.580 --> 30:38.520]  It is so good.
[30:38.840 --> 30:42.520]  I talked about before, like not wanting to commit to like doing a review
[30:42.520 --> 30:45.060]  or talking about it because I wouldn't want the audience to interpret
[30:45.060 --> 30:47.140]  that as like I didn't like it or whatever.
[30:47.280 --> 30:48.500]  It's incredible.
[30:48.880 --> 30:49.760]  So you went down there?
[30:50.320 --> 30:52.060]  I they had a soft open yesterday.
[30:52.060 --> 30:52.840]  I went down there.
[30:52.840 --> 30:56.860]  They're nice enough to bring some challah earlier in the week to try.
[30:57.060 --> 30:58.340]  They brought me some coffee.
[30:58.420 --> 30:59.340]  They have a coffee partnership.
[30:59.520 --> 31:00.460]  I have a cup of coffee.
[31:00.540 --> 31:03.960]  I'm going to have my first coffee in a moment, like a proper
[31:03.960 --> 31:05.900]  as part of the redemption year.
[31:06.160 --> 31:10.160]  I forgot I did this, but I made a monstrosity of a coffee
[31:10.160 --> 31:12.860]  at one point on the show, and I've never tried it again.
[31:13.380 --> 31:16.620]  Well, didn't you make like Cheerios with coffee or something?
[31:16.880 --> 31:20.040]  It was it was like I had a cured cured pod
[31:20.040 --> 31:23.540]  that was like vanilla walnut Italy was the flavor.
[31:23.740 --> 31:24.760]  Like it didn't make sense.
[31:25.420 --> 31:27.080]  And then it didn't taste good.
[31:27.100 --> 31:31.040]  So then I dumped a sugar cookie in it and I poured in a bag of
[31:31.740 --> 31:34.000]  of Sour Patch Kids watermelon.
[31:34.620 --> 31:36.160]  It was a mess. It was terrible.
[31:37.120 --> 31:38.620]  Well, I was just trying to salvage.
[31:38.920 --> 31:40.660]  I was like, this is bitter. I don't have any sugar.
[31:40.800 --> 31:41.920]  Here's some sugar cookies.
[31:42.260 --> 31:43.240]  Have some sugar cookies.
[31:43.620 --> 31:45.280]  I like that you did that with the coffee.
[31:45.420 --> 31:46.960]  You also did that with your salad.
[31:49.600 --> 31:52.320]  Well, the salad, I think those were different issues.
[31:52.500 --> 31:54.520]  But I see I see your point.
[31:55.140 --> 31:58.880]  I'm trying to think, am I missing the biggest, the coffee?
[31:58.980 --> 32:00.080]  I have the thing.
[32:00.980 --> 32:01.800]  That was fun.
[32:01.920 --> 32:05.400]  I had another one where like a few days after we're texting or where he was like,
[32:05.420 --> 32:08.680]  yeah, I had to delete a comment from our Facebook because they were like cursing
[32:08.680 --> 32:11.500]  and stuff and talking about the Vancouver child kicker.
[32:11.560 --> 32:12.860]  Like, well, I don't know what that is.
[32:13.500 --> 32:16.980]  And then having to explain the downside is that the other associations
[32:16.980 --> 32:18.400]  that are out of context and horrendous.
[32:18.520 --> 32:22.120]  Can I just take a second to speak to to our wonderful audience?
[32:22.700 --> 32:26.920]  You'd be very kind audience to my hubby's bagels and all businesses.
[32:26.960 --> 32:30.340]  If you're if you're speaking on them to them on behalf of Face,
[32:31.060 --> 32:32.580]  we are a wholesome podcast.
[32:32.720 --> 32:35.500]  We are about uplifting and and and
[32:36.560 --> 32:39.180]  shining a light on local businesses and supporting them,
[32:39.200 --> 32:40.760]  not deriding them in any way.
[32:40.760 --> 32:45.260]  So let's make sure that we're any interactions we have with any bagel
[32:45.260 --> 32:48.560]  company that we like or any coffee company, for that matter.
[32:48.940 --> 32:50.020]  Let's make sure they're positive.
[32:50.300 --> 32:53.160]  Yeah. And it's important to also remember that anyone we talk about mentioned
[32:53.160 --> 32:56.040]  they didn't necessarily choose to be mentioned by us.
[32:56.300 --> 32:57.660]  Absolutely. Yes. Yes.
[32:57.900 --> 33:01.800]  We have. Yeah, I felt I felt they I've tripped into their world,
[33:01.800 --> 33:03.440]  but it ended up being like great.
[33:03.560 --> 33:05.140]  They're the most wonderful people.
[33:05.220 --> 33:06.980]  Their food is absurdly good.
[33:07.400 --> 33:09.020]  Their cream cheese is ridiculous.
[33:09.020 --> 33:11.880]  It's all it's all somewhat like the best food I've ever had.
[33:11.980 --> 33:13.680]  Like, genuinely, it's incredible.
[33:14.100 --> 33:14.580]  Well, that's good.
[33:14.760 --> 33:17.920]  It would it would have sucked if we had to pretend to like this.
[33:18.100 --> 33:20.640]  It would have it would have been a problem.
[33:25.560 --> 33:27.080]  Today's episode is sponsored by Honey,
[33:27.220 --> 33:29.740]  the easy way to save when shopping on your iPhone or computer.
[33:29.960 --> 33:31.160]  I love to online shop.
[33:31.260 --> 33:34.160]  I do it all the time, but I never have a promo code ready at checkout.

[33:58.220 --> 34:01.440]  I recently used Honey to save on some T-shirts that I bought.
[34:01.580 --> 34:03.520]  It was fantastic. I saved like ten dollars.
[34:04.040 --> 34:05.760]  It was an all time day. It was a great day.
[34:06.160 --> 34:08.500]  But did you know that Honey doesn't just work on desktop?

[34:30.100 --> 34:31.980]  This podcast is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[34:32.320 --> 34:34.880]  People don't always realize that physical symptoms like headaches,
[34:35.080 --> 34:38.140]  teeth grinding and even digestive issues can be indicators of stress.
[34:38.140 --> 34:41.960]  Let's not forget about doom scrolling, sleeping too little, sleeping too much,
[34:42.080 --> 34:43.480]  under eating and overeating.
[34:43.840 --> 34:48.240]  My personal experience with stress, I'm sure it's very similar to many people.
[34:48.460 --> 34:53.620]  Like there's always different stresses in your life, whether it be financial work,
[34:53.880 --> 34:57.060]  family, all sort of, I feel, relatable,
[34:57.640 --> 35:03.420]  complex issues that are stressful in so many ways to so many varying degrees as well.
[35:04.100 --> 35:05.560]  Stress shows up in all kinds of ways.
[35:05.720 --> 35:08.040]  And in a world that's telling you to do more, sleep less,
[35:08.040 --> 35:09.140]  grind all the time.
[35:09.600 --> 35:13.300]  Here's a reminder to take care of yourself, do less and maybe try some therapy.
[35:13.920 --> 35:16.040]  All great things to consider.
[35:16.420 --> 35:20.340]  It's so easy to burn out or stretch yourself too thin.
[35:20.600 --> 35:23.580]  And there are real consequences to doing those things,
[35:23.640 --> 35:25.560]  at least in my personal experience.
[35:25.920 --> 35:30.000]  I know with stress, especially there are times where I've been dealing
[35:30.000 --> 35:34.280]  with certain things that have felt so overwhelming and also trying to fight
[35:34.280 --> 35:38.540]  against those feelings of by talking to them with friends or family that is
[35:38.540 --> 35:40.700]  burdening them in some way, which it never is.
[35:40.740 --> 35:44.000]  Like it's you're never burdened to discuss your feelings with people.
[35:44.180 --> 35:48.540]  But that is an area in which I found therapy to be super helpful.
[35:48.680 --> 35:52.360]  It's just being able to talk about these things and not just live with them
[35:52.360 --> 35:53.760]  kind of eating at me internally.
[35:54.180 --> 35:57.760]  It's just so much healthier to go through that process.
[35:58.240 --> 35:59.920]  Everybody has different things that work for them.
[35:59.980 --> 36:02.900]  But therapy is a thing that has been super helpful to me.
[36:02.900 --> 36:06.580]  BetterHelp is a customized online therapy that offers video, phone,
[36:06.680 --> 36:08.700]  and even live chat sessions with your therapist.

[38:17.160 --> 38:21.760]  I have something in mind. I'm pretty sure, like, we kind of talked about it a little bit,
[38:21.820 --> 38:24.460]  and then, you know, they're in the process of opening, and I didn't want to be like,
[38:24.460 --> 38:28.760]  well, you're fucking figuring everything out. Let me talk about this thing that is all that
[38:28.760 --> 38:33.960]  important. So, I haven't clarified it with them, but I feel pretty good about what it is.
[38:34.460 --> 38:36.340]  And you, did you introduce yourself when you were in there?
[38:36.880 --> 38:42.780]  Uh, well, so that was, yes. Yes, I did. Well, we met before. They were kind of,
[38:42.960 --> 38:47.860]  they are so ridiculously kind, they dropped some bread off to, uh, to where I live.
[38:47.900 --> 38:49.160]  Jesus Christ.
[38:49.360 --> 38:51.160]  They're, they're, they're so sweet. They're amazing.
[38:51.160 --> 38:52.060]  These people are saints.
[38:52.060 --> 38:56.680]  How did you manage to get there? Was it under the power of your own legs?
[38:57.060 --> 38:59.980]  It was under the power of my own legs. The legs are back. The legs are fully,
[39:00.080 --> 39:01.540]  we're moving. It's great.
[39:02.280 --> 39:02.580]  Yeah.
[39:03.040 --> 39:03.340]  Congrats.
[39:03.900 --> 39:04.440]  Thank you.
[39:04.820 --> 39:07.800]  You gonna start that marathon tomorrow, then, or?
[39:08.280 --> 39:14.120]  No, I'm gonna enjoy not being in pain. It's, uh, I got checked out and everything. I'm good.
[39:14.720 --> 39:20.580]  But, yeah, um, bagels are amazing. I have the coffee. They sell the coffee. I don't know if
[39:20.580 --> 39:24.020]  we could put a link or something to the coffee they sell or whatever. I have their blend.
[39:24.700 --> 39:27.660]  I'm about to try. This is my, do you have any, any tips?
[39:28.500 --> 39:32.500]  Well, first off, let's read the notes on the coffee. What kind of, tell me about the flavor.
[39:32.660 --> 39:37.140]  That's a, that's a great, that's a great question. I should have, I don't have the bag with me.
[39:37.440 --> 39:42.780]  Do you think I would do that? Uh, it's, uh, give me a second. I'll pull, I'll pull it up.
[39:43.180 --> 39:47.540]  I put sugar in it. I bought one of those custom pods that you could put in a Keurig.
[39:48.660 --> 39:50.120]  Still, still a Keurig coffee.
[39:50.120 --> 39:52.860]  What's a custom pod? You like, you make your own pod?
[39:53.360 --> 39:57.520]  Yeah, yeah. Like it's a reusable pod where you can grind coffee beans because it's a bean-based
[39:57.520 --> 40:00.880]  coffee. So we grounded the beans up and, uh, put it in.
[40:00.980 --> 40:03.120]  It's like a little portafilter, almost. Yeah, exactly.
[40:03.340 --> 40:06.660]  Did you just, did you just say it's a bean-based coffee?
[40:07.200 --> 40:08.700]  Well, you know, like it's, it's...
[40:09.420 --> 40:10.940]  Is it? Missed that completely.
[40:11.140 --> 40:16.020]  Am I, am I fucking stupid or is that, is that, are you, isn't all coffee bean-based?
[40:16.020 --> 40:20.880]  I don't buy coffee. I'm assuming there are some coffees you can buy that are pre-grind,
[40:21.200 --> 40:24.120]  that are already grinded for you. I don't know if that's a thing.
[40:24.580 --> 40:26.380]  From beans. From beans. Yeah, it's an unnecessary,
[40:27.000 --> 40:30.040]  I meant un, not grinded, is what I was going for.
[40:30.400 --> 40:34.700]  They sent you, ground by the way, they sent you full beans and then you had to grind them down.
[40:34.940 --> 40:36.160]  Yes. Okay.
[40:36.660 --> 40:39.900]  Exactly. I think Eric is big into grinding.
[40:40.320 --> 40:44.240]  To eliminate any confusion, this coffee does come from coffee beans.
[40:44.240 --> 40:48.600]  This is the most insane conversation, like, this is, I'm, I'm like,
[40:48.660 --> 40:52.820]  I'm fucking grinding my teeth listening to it. This is nuts.
[40:53.980 --> 40:56.500]  I'm not a coffee person. I'm trying.
[40:56.880 --> 40:58.880]  Yeah, clearly. I'm trying.
[40:58.880 --> 41:01.660]  We can throw some beans in Eric's mouth and then he just spits it into the
[41:01.660 --> 41:03.860]  custom Keurig cup and we're ready to go.
[41:07.270 --> 41:13.310]  Okay, so it's, it's a Guatemalan chocolate berry is, is their, is their blend.
[41:14.110 --> 41:15.950]  So it's going to be chocolatey and fruity.
[41:17.030 --> 41:18.810]  Yes. It's a chocolatey fruity.
[41:19.130 --> 41:20.970]  That sounds good. Pretty good. Pretty good.
[41:21.050 --> 41:25.030]  I put a little bit of sugar in, nothing else. I didn't get crazy. Just a little bit.
[41:25.430 --> 41:28.290]  No cream, no milk, nothing like that. Just sugar and coffee.
[41:28.450 --> 41:29.410]  No cream. No chow mein.
[41:29.650 --> 41:31.470]  Just no chow mein.
[41:32.350 --> 41:35.090]  No, no ramen noodles. Nothing like that. You're okay.
[41:35.530 --> 41:38.430]  Okay. I'm going to take a sip. This is a big moment. I'm like,
[41:38.470 --> 41:41.930]  I'm actually trying real coffee. This is a documented moment of my life.
[41:41.930 --> 41:46.250]  I want you to like it too. I want you to become a coffee guy like Eric.
[41:46.370 --> 41:51.290]  It smells great. I'm going to take a sip. That's actually really good.
[41:51.850 --> 41:52.130]  Yeah?
[41:52.510 --> 41:57.390]  Yeah, I could get, I can get into this. That's, that's not bad at all.
[41:57.710 --> 41:57.970]  Yeah.
[41:58.330 --> 41:59.910]  That's way better than what I made.
[42:00.330 --> 42:03.130]  Yeah, coffee's pretty good when you don't put a bunch of shits inside it.
[42:03.230 --> 42:07.090]  There's a, probably a reason it's like a multi, multi-billion dollar industry.
[42:07.390 --> 42:11.330]  That's delicious. What have I, I've been fucking up. Why have I not?
[42:11.930 --> 42:15.750]  This is amazing. I've been telling you to drink coffee for a very long time.
[42:15.850 --> 42:16.590]  It's fucking amazing.
[42:16.990 --> 42:18.010]  This is very good.
[42:18.270 --> 42:21.170]  I think, I think we can potentially talk to them about, um,
[42:21.510 --> 42:24.950]  being Nanaimo's exclusive Bovril vendor as well.
[42:32.730 --> 42:35.970]  I don't think Nanaimo needs that. I think we got enough.
[42:36.290 --> 42:37.830]  It's, it's cold there sometimes, right?
[42:38.310 --> 42:39.970]  Uh, yeah. It gets cold.
[42:39.970 --> 42:43.410]  Dude, look, a cup of Bovril in the snow. Oh, amazing.
[42:43.490 --> 42:45.590]  Oh, while we're, while we're watching our hockey team go.
[42:46.150 --> 42:46.250]  Dude.
[42:48.690 --> 42:52.510]  Blue Owl Coffee Roasters in Nanaimo, Vancouver Island. That's a cute logo.
[42:52.890 --> 42:53.690]  It's a very cute logo.
[42:53.850 --> 42:58.050]  Very happy owl. He looks wise, but whimsical at the same time.
[42:58.850 --> 43:01.110]  That should lead to the blend. But yeah, that, that's been,
[43:01.210 --> 43:05.310]  I'm in the process of finalizing the regulation bagel. Their food is amazing.
[43:05.410 --> 43:08.370]  If you're ever in the area, I'd highly recommend checking out my hubby's bagels.
[43:08.570 --> 43:09.030]  They're delicious.
[43:09.650 --> 43:13.030]  Well, I gotta say, Andrew, uh, on a scale of, uh,
[43:13.370 --> 43:17.410]  salad creaming to 10, I give you a 10 on drinking that coffee.
[43:17.830 --> 43:22.950]  Thank you. I'm glad. It's terrifying. Like, there's a weird pressure with,
[43:23.070 --> 43:26.630]  cause they're so sweet. And I wanted to like accurately represent all this stuff.
[43:26.670 --> 43:28.410]  Yeah. You don't want to, you don't want to lie, right?
[43:28.470 --> 43:29.590]  No, absolutely not.
[43:29.690 --> 43:31.030]  You gotta, you gotta stay true to yourself.
[43:31.410 --> 43:34.450]  Yeah. And just also just like describing it poorly or like, I don't know.
[43:34.450 --> 43:39.350]  It feels I'm okay. Making myself look like a total idiot. They don't deserve that.
[43:39.950 --> 43:42.750]  The stakes are higher when other people are involved.
[43:43.210 --> 43:44.990]  Yeah, that's really good. I'm going to drink more of this coffee.
[43:45.530 --> 43:49.330]  You should. Drink it every day until you die. Like most people.
[43:49.930 --> 43:54.750]  I have a quick question about, um, urinal etiquette or urinal etiquette.
[43:54.810 --> 43:55.070]  Okay.
[43:55.330 --> 44:01.630]  If you say you've got like a bank of five pisses, right. Then you've got a guy on the left one.
[44:02.210 --> 44:02.830]  Where do you go?
[44:02.830 --> 44:04.190]  The right most.
[44:04.850 --> 44:05.930]  Uh, yes, that's correct.
[44:06.270 --> 44:07.550]  Right. The one that's furthest.
[44:07.550 --> 44:11.330]  Wait, well, is it now? It depends. Is it a stranger or is it you? Because if I walk into
[44:11.330 --> 44:14.130]  a urinal and you're pissing, I'm getting as close to you as possible to make sure.
[44:14.150 --> 44:15.030]  That's true. No, it's a stranger.
[44:15.490 --> 44:16.010]  Okay. Okay.
[44:16.690 --> 44:22.250]  Furthest right. And then the next person goes middle. And then the next person who comes in
[44:22.250 --> 44:25.790]  has a real evaluation they need to make. That's where the choice gets tough.
[44:26.210 --> 44:27.670]  Once there's three people in the stall.
[44:28.150 --> 44:31.530]  I have switched up my urinal etiquette.
[44:33.590 --> 44:34.470]  What? Okay.
[44:34.710 --> 44:37.910]  Well, I was pissing at the Alamo the other day.
[44:38.210 --> 44:38.730]  And, um...
[44:38.730 --> 44:39.190]  What movie?
[44:39.790 --> 44:40.610]  What did I watch?
[44:40.850 --> 44:42.550]  Everything, everywhere, all at once.
[44:42.910 --> 44:45.010]  Oh, you're in that. Apparently.
[44:45.570 --> 44:47.530]  I'm not in it. I gave them a clip.
[44:48.170 --> 44:50.510]  Yeah, but you're even in the credits. That's very cool.
[44:50.610 --> 44:50.850]  Yeah.
[44:50.910 --> 44:51.250]  Congratulations.
[44:51.450 --> 44:51.710]  Nice of them.
[44:52.730 --> 45:00.550]  There was five and just a big old puddle of piss under the right most three.
[45:00.550 --> 45:03.430]  So I thought I could either stand in all the piss
[45:03.430 --> 45:06.490]  or I could stand at the one that's right next to the guy on the left.
[45:07.170 --> 45:07.370]  Yeah.
[45:07.790 --> 45:07.950]  Yeah.
[45:08.010 --> 45:09.910]  And I went for it. I thought, you know what?
[45:10.210 --> 45:12.730]  I'm going to stand on dry ground and piss right next to this guy.
[45:12.890 --> 45:16.430]  And I think you may have been confused, but what would you do in that situation?
[45:16.970 --> 45:18.710]  I mean, I think you're a lunatic.
[45:20.250 --> 45:21.830]  That's my initial response.
[45:22.010 --> 45:22.070]  Really?
[45:22.450 --> 45:23.650]  Yeah, I have a lot of questions.
[45:23.810 --> 45:26.330]  Because there are a lot of variables to this that may change my opinion
[45:26.330 --> 45:27.510]  on what you're talking about.
[45:27.910 --> 45:29.230]  How badly did you need to pee?
[45:29.230 --> 45:31.170]  Was there no ability to hold?
[45:31.690 --> 45:32.770]  Well, I don't think I did it that bad.
[45:32.830 --> 45:36.170]  But, you know, you get that thing when you're when you're in eyeshot of a toilet.
[45:36.410 --> 45:37.370]  You just really need to pee.
[45:37.710 --> 45:37.930]  Yeah.
[45:37.990 --> 45:39.150]  So it was it was on the brink.
[45:39.190 --> 45:39.890]  I was it was coming.
[45:40.350 --> 45:41.190]  I get it. Yeah.
[45:41.270 --> 45:42.310]  There's no hold with me.
[45:42.390 --> 45:44.650]  Once I enter the bathroom, there's we got it's going.
[45:45.070 --> 45:45.550]  There's no stop.
[45:45.570 --> 45:49.450]  But I thought, you know, I don't need to conform to this social norm
[45:50.450 --> 45:53.690]  over getting my shoes covered in loads of piss.
[45:53.770 --> 45:57.190]  See, this is this is where I think there's two layers to this.
[45:57.190 --> 46:01.270]  It's not, I think, a social norm as much as it is a basic decency.
[46:02.770 --> 46:06.930]  Someone would still stand if there were four people at the other five.
[46:07.130 --> 46:07.510]  Sure.
[46:07.810 --> 46:08.930]  Someone would go there.
[46:09.030 --> 46:10.470]  So it's not like an insane move.
[46:10.810 --> 46:13.430]  It's it's a normal move under different circumstances.
[46:14.110 --> 46:16.650]  Yeah, I'd say I think it's I understand what you're saying.
[46:17.170 --> 46:20.370]  My other question would be, are there toilets in that bathroom?
[46:20.750 --> 46:21.770]  Like, were there stalls?
[46:22.070 --> 46:23.590]  Yes. Were there available stalls?
[46:24.030 --> 46:24.490]  Oh, yeah.
[46:24.490 --> 46:27.330]  But, you know, then you're you've you've lost.
[46:27.510 --> 46:27.870]  You've lost.
[46:28.010 --> 46:30.110]  And you've got to touch your door.
[46:30.210 --> 46:31.190]  You've got to touch a seat.
[46:31.270 --> 46:32.170]  You've got to rummage.
[46:32.490 --> 46:33.130]  You got to touch.
[46:33.190 --> 46:34.470]  What do you mean you got to touch a seat?
[46:34.830 --> 46:37.030]  Toilet like public toilets don't have seats.
[46:37.330 --> 46:38.290]  What are you talking about?
[46:38.470 --> 46:39.330]  Well, touch a flusher.
[46:39.430 --> 46:39.810]  Then I don't know.
[46:39.910 --> 46:42.050]  I didn't go in a lot of public toilets have seats.
[46:42.050 --> 46:42.410]  You got to.
[46:42.510 --> 46:42.650]  Yeah.
[46:42.710 --> 46:43.590]  What are you talking about?
[46:43.670 --> 46:43.790]  Yeah.
[46:43.810 --> 46:46.370]  Well, there's like the seat you sit on, but not the cover seat.
[46:46.770 --> 46:46.930]  Yeah.
[46:46.930 --> 46:47.830]  But what if it was up?
[46:49.390 --> 46:50.570]  Well, why would that was down?
[46:50.630 --> 46:52.030]  I mean, what?
[46:52.110 --> 46:52.910]  It's got to be precise.
[46:52.910 --> 46:53.970]  You don't want to.
[46:54.510 --> 46:55.110]  That's rude.
[46:55.450 --> 46:56.130]  Aim small, miss small.
[46:56.550 --> 46:57.030]  Well, what are you?
[46:57.050 --> 46:58.550]  What are you doing in the situation then, Andrew?
[46:59.030 --> 47:00.810]  I'm definitely going to the toilet.
[47:01.290 --> 47:02.490]  I'm not going to stand next to here.
[47:02.610 --> 47:03.850]  I would do one of two things.
[47:04.630 --> 47:06.250]  I'd say the stalls are gone.
[47:06.390 --> 47:06.990]  There's no stalls.
[47:07.290 --> 47:07.550]  OK.
[47:07.630 --> 47:08.550]  There are no stalls.
[47:08.750 --> 47:14.350]  And I'm as I'm matching your level of need to pee, but I can hold it for a little bit.
[47:14.450 --> 47:14.970]  I'm OK.
[47:15.110 --> 47:16.010]  I'm not going to explode.
[47:16.210 --> 47:21.770]  The only scenario in which I'm using the urinal next to the guy is if I'm going to explode.
[47:21.770 --> 47:22.850]  So you're going to.
[47:23.650 --> 47:25.550]  Well, I guess this is very fitting of piss boy.
[47:25.670 --> 47:27.650]  You're going to stand there and watch a guy piss is what you know.
[47:27.810 --> 47:29.110]  No, this is what I'm going to do.
[47:29.570 --> 47:32.210]  I'm going to go to the sink and I'm going to, like, wash my hands.
[47:32.290 --> 47:32.930]  I'm going to do something.
[47:33.210 --> 47:35.730]  I'm going to pretend that I have busy work to do at the sink.
[47:36.150 --> 47:38.110]  You're going to pre-wash your hands.
[47:38.410 --> 47:39.030]  I mean, I get it.
[47:39.030 --> 47:40.610]  You don't want to touch your dick with dirty hands.
[47:40.610 --> 47:41.910]  I need to do something in that room.
[47:41.910 --> 47:45.790]  So I'm not just waiting, as Gavin said, just watching this guy waiting to finish.
[47:46.170 --> 47:49.150]  I would I would go to the sink and I would kill some time for a minute.
[47:49.230 --> 47:49.990]  I'd wash my hand.
[47:50.330 --> 47:51.590]  I'd probably really need to pee.
[47:51.590 --> 47:55.190]  And there's four open urinals.
[47:55.710 --> 47:59.190]  Yeah, I mean, I'm saying in case of in an event of an emergency,
[47:59.670 --> 48:02.490]  I completely understand why you did what you did.
[48:02.770 --> 48:05.490]  But outside of that, I would never do that.
[48:07.310 --> 48:12.590]  Gavin, I'm going to I'm going to say that I think what you did was 100% correct.
[48:12.650 --> 48:13.810]  And I would have done the same thing.
[48:14.110 --> 48:19.170]  The idea the idea I'm not at a point in my life where I want to hold where I want to
[48:19.170 --> 48:26.910]  I want to hold back and create discomfort in my own body to make it convenient for somebody else.
[48:27.350 --> 48:31.710]  And I can't like the idea of standing in somebody else's stale piss makes me want to vomit.
[48:31.910 --> 48:35.370]  I sit crisscross applesauce most of my life.
[48:35.550 --> 48:37.090]  I'm sitting crisscross applesauce right now.
[48:37.190 --> 48:42.070]  And basically, that's that's just asking to get dirty pee on the sides of your legs.
[48:42.130 --> 48:43.010]  I couldn't do that.
[48:43.390 --> 48:48.650]  So I would and I'm not and I'm not going to I assume I don't know who this fucking person is.
[48:48.650 --> 48:52.450]  And I'll never in my life see this person again, probably.
[48:53.010 --> 48:54.490]  So I'm going to go up and I'm going to stand next to them.
[48:54.550 --> 48:56.750]  I'm going to use the urinal that's there to be used.
[48:57.670 --> 48:59.010]  Interesting. What about Eric?
[48:59.690 --> 49:01.210]  I just use the urinal just piss.
[49:01.350 --> 49:02.310]  Just what are we doing?
[49:02.370 --> 49:02.990]  Which one though?
[49:04.450 --> 49:05.250]  Far right.
[49:05.490 --> 49:08.690]  Like at that point, you're going to stand and stand in the piss.
[49:09.010 --> 49:09.710]  It doesn't matter.
[49:10.110 --> 49:14.410]  You're it's hey, I don't know how clean you think the rest of the bathroom is, but it's not.
[49:14.530 --> 49:15.350]  That's a great point.
[49:15.350 --> 49:18.390]  It's cleaner than standing in standing wet.
[49:18.590 --> 49:22.030]  Then spread your feet a little bit for like to me.
[49:22.210 --> 49:24.450]  It's like you're going in the bathroom already.
[49:24.570 --> 49:26.270]  Don't intentionally step in the piss.
[49:26.350 --> 49:29.490]  There's a way to stand where you're not stepping directly in the piss.
[49:29.970 --> 49:35.430]  But but to get so hung up about like, oh, I don't I don't know if I'm going to go walk over there.
[49:35.630 --> 49:36.990]  Bro, where do you think you are?
[49:37.170 --> 49:38.890]  What do you think has happened in that bathroom?
[49:38.910 --> 49:40.510]  Because it's been way worse than that.
[49:41.370 --> 49:45.010]  I like the idea of doing like a trick shot, like standing behind the pee.
[49:45.010 --> 49:50.270]  Yeah, he's turning into a fucking contortionist trying to do like complicated moves.
[49:50.430 --> 49:52.910]  I'll just take two steps back and rainbow it in.
[49:53.010 --> 49:53.650]  You know what I mean?
[49:53.870 --> 49:54.610]  It'll just stand.
[49:54.810 --> 49:58.650]  Just stand next to another human being doing the same thing you're doing.
[49:59.870 --> 50:04.330]  The piss in from a distance to just piss in a clean urinal.
[50:04.650 --> 50:06.750]  Yeah, you know, you just yeah, you just arc it.
[50:06.910 --> 50:13.030]  Stand on my toes, lean back a little, you know, just if I was pissing on the far left.
[50:13.590 --> 50:16.810]  And then I just saw a load of piss land in the urinal.
[50:17.490 --> 50:20.550]  Without seeing the guy, I'd be like, this is way worse.
[50:20.910 --> 50:27.970]  I take my pants all the way down to my ankles and then I just I arc it back and I rainbow it in.
[50:29.970 --> 50:33.690]  You're just peeing at the urinal and you turn to your right and somebody's being
[50:33.690 --> 50:36.970]  held up like fucking Simba pissing into the urinal at a distance.
[50:37.410 --> 50:37.730]  God.
[50:40.550 --> 50:45.730]  Yeah, you just just go to the clean toilet and pee next to the guy.
[50:46.150 --> 50:50.310]  Yeah, I thought I didn't really make a it wasn't really a huge decision time,
[50:50.370 --> 50:51.930]  but it was a little bit of a dilemma in my head.
[50:52.030 --> 50:54.050]  And it was a slightly guilty piss.
[50:54.110 --> 50:55.690]  One of my guiltier pisses that I've had.
[50:56.110 --> 50:58.430]  When you go, let me ask you a question, because I was thinking about this the other day.
[50:58.470 --> 51:01.590]  We were in, uh, fuck, where were we, Gav?
[51:01.650 --> 51:04.510]  I think we were at the event in San Francisco.
[51:05.050 --> 51:07.450]  And I was peeing in the one of the bathrooms there.
[51:07.570 --> 51:09.610]  And there were a row of your urinals.
[51:10.110 --> 51:11.110]  I almost said it the weird way you do.
[51:11.390 --> 51:12.470]  There were a row of urinals.
[51:13.270 --> 51:17.170]  And and I went to the I was like, the closest one to the door was, you know,
[51:17.210 --> 51:17.830]  was to the left.
[51:17.870 --> 51:20.510]  And then there were like five or six that went all the way to the right.
[51:20.610 --> 51:23.190]  And it was kind of like dark and out of the way.
[51:23.250 --> 51:23.870]  The far right one.
[51:23.890 --> 51:29.510]  And I was wondering to myself, I wonder if you could see urinal usage over time.
[51:29.850 --> 51:31.870]  Like, has the far left one?
[51:31.970 --> 51:33.930]  Has this been peed in one million times?
[51:33.930 --> 51:37.710]  But the far right one has been peed in 45 times.
[51:37.810 --> 51:39.150]  Yeah, I want to see the heat map.
[51:39.530 --> 51:41.270]  Yeah, the heat map, that's great, absolutely.
[51:42.410 --> 51:48.450]  I want to see the halo bungee heat map of like how people piss and which stalls are
[51:48.450 --> 51:53.070]  just getting hammered and which are relatively, you know, just use free.
[51:53.590 --> 51:55.130]  Yeah, it's got to be the left one.
[51:55.310 --> 51:58.750]  I feel like in an English speaking country, you start left.
[51:58.890 --> 51:59.830]  Like you'd read a book.
[52:00.050 --> 52:02.830]  I think everyone goes to that one on a completely empty set.
[52:02.830 --> 52:06.830]  Oh, OK, for me, it's actually dependent on where the door is.
[52:07.610 --> 52:10.710]  I want to be pissing as far away from the entrance as possible.
[52:11.050 --> 52:12.470]  Oh, interesting. OK, yeah.
[52:12.510 --> 52:16.990]  I want space. I want space. And I feel like I'm freeing up all the lanes for anybody who
[52:16.990 --> 52:17.830]  comes in after me.
[52:18.270 --> 52:22.510]  What I feel like you don't get quite as much in this country is just the big piss troughs.
[52:23.570 --> 52:30.830]  No, you get those a lot at at like venues where you go to see bands,
[52:30.830 --> 52:32.790]  like like bars.
[52:33.350 --> 52:36.310]  Like if you go to emos, you're pissing in a trough, probably in Austin,
[52:36.810 --> 52:38.890]  or if you go to like some sporting events.
[52:39.110 --> 52:42.330]  I've definitely been to some football games where you just like I went to see the Lions,
[52:42.390 --> 52:46.190]  and I'm pretty sure people are just straight trough pissing in that one, if I remember.
[52:48.990 --> 52:53.130]  And that's even worse because they just pour a bunch of ice into the trough.
[52:53.210 --> 52:56.670]  So you're like pissing hot piss on ice and watching like...
[52:56.670 --> 52:57.990]  It's a good game, isn't it?
[52:58.010 --> 52:58.630]  Piss mist.
[52:58.630 --> 53:01.630]  Yeah, it makes steam sometimes.
[53:02.070 --> 53:03.170]  Yeah, it makes urine steam.
[53:03.930 --> 53:06.550]  And you're just breathing some guy's piss next to you.
[53:06.930 --> 53:08.870]  You're like the worst survivor challenge ever.
[53:09.730 --> 53:13.890]  Get immunity this week. One block of ice per side.
[53:17.870 --> 53:22.890]  Do you think you could piss... if you had like an ice cube, say the size of a mug,
[53:23.530 --> 53:25.250]  could you piss a hole straight through it?
[53:26.730 --> 53:27.130]  I...
[53:27.690 --> 53:30.550]  My gut says yes, but I have nothing to back that on.
[53:31.650 --> 53:34.610]  I drink a lot of water every day.
[53:34.690 --> 53:37.730]  I feel like I pee enough that I could do some damage to that.
[53:38.090 --> 53:39.770]  Oh, because isn't that the purpose of the ice actually?
[53:39.870 --> 53:43.530]  Isn't that to prevent steam? Like it stops the steam on a cold day?
[53:44.090 --> 53:44.950]  What is the point of ice?
[53:45.490 --> 53:49.110]  I think it knocks the smell down to cool it and knock the heat smell down.
[53:50.090 --> 53:52.190]  Piss smells worse the hotter it is.
[53:55.410 --> 53:56.630]  I bet I could piss through a mug.
[53:56.990 --> 53:59.730]  Yeah, what about like one of those giant circular...
[54:00.770 --> 54:03.090]  Well, hold on. Do you... now do you care?
[54:03.150 --> 54:06.790]  Because I could freeze up a mug real fast. Do you care to place a wager on that?
[54:06.850 --> 54:09.990]  Like what would you do if... what are you prepared to bet?
[54:12.150 --> 54:12.510]  Uh...
[54:12.510 --> 54:15.870]  Yeah, I just... it's a volume thing for me. I'm not sure my bladder's...
[54:15.870 --> 54:19.010]  I don't think... because I don't think you can do it. I think it would...
[54:19.010 --> 54:20.390]  I think it would melt far too slowly.
[54:20.770 --> 54:24.570]  Yeah, I've thought of the times you pour like... you turn on the hot tap on ice
[54:24.570 --> 54:25.770]  and it does take quite a while, doesn't it?
[54:26.050 --> 54:26.490]  Yeah, it does.
[54:26.590 --> 54:32.250]  It does. I feel like much like burgers, like a half second into your piss, you would realize...
[54:33.610 --> 54:34.870]  I've made a terrible mistake.
[54:35.110 --> 54:35.250]  Yeah.
[54:36.230 --> 54:40.430]  That'd be interesting though. What if we had... when we all meet up, we'll get four frozen mugs.
[54:40.590 --> 54:41.070]  No! No!
[54:41.070 --> 54:46.310]  And we see... we'll stick a stick into the dent that you made and measure to see who went the furthest in.
[54:46.590 --> 54:50.870]  Who has the hottest piss? Will it be piss boy or will it be one of his friends or co-worker?
[54:52.870 --> 54:53.230]  What?
[54:57.150 --> 55:01.590]  Now that's interesting. If we do a temperature test and see who's got the hottest piss.
[55:02.110 --> 55:04.650]  Yeah, because one of us will have hotter piss than the other.
[55:04.990 --> 55:06.990]  Oh, guaranteed. Guaranteed.
[55:07.490 --> 55:13.050]  Well, we need three thermometers and we might as well get to fill up some mugs with ice too.
[55:13.870 --> 55:15.390]  Craig needs to get off his fucking bullshit.
[55:17.210 --> 55:18.530]  What is Craig's problem today?
[55:19.110 --> 55:22.650]  He heard about all this piss talk and he wanted out of here,
[55:22.650 --> 55:24.630]  but Nick dragged him back kicking and screaming.
[55:24.630 --> 55:27.370]  Do you have a problem with the piss content in this episode, Eric?
[55:27.850 --> 55:30.490]  I don't personally have a problem with the piss content,
[55:30.670 --> 55:34.070]  but I am thinking about how we're supposed to sponsor a junior hockey team
[55:34.070 --> 55:35.930]  and this is a very piss-forward episode.
[55:36.830 --> 55:38.810]  Well, maybe this isn't the episode we show them.
[55:39.230 --> 55:41.570]  Oh, and Geoff, which episode do we show them?
[55:42.030 --> 55:48.590]  I think we just edit all of like the My Hubby's Bagel thing, put it as its own fake link.
[55:48.590 --> 55:53.230]  So your plan is to show them all this stuff that's just local to your town
[55:53.230 --> 55:55.570]  and then they think it's just like a local podcast?
[55:55.830 --> 55:57.410]  Well, I'm trying to think of a wholesome...
[55:57.410 --> 55:58.450]  And then we have the piss reveal.
[55:58.990 --> 56:01.530]  I'm trying to think of what's the most wholesome block.
[56:01.810 --> 56:04.750]  It would be interesting to do like an hour of wholesome f***face.
[56:04.850 --> 56:06.450]  What that sounds like and what that is.
[56:07.170 --> 56:07.830]  Where is that?
[56:08.110 --> 56:08.890]  Like, I don't, I'm not sure.
[56:09.050 --> 56:13.410]  I'm sure there's enough moments across 98 episodes to do that.
[56:13.730 --> 56:15.270]  I just don't know what it would sound like.
[56:15.270 --> 56:20.710]  This is heavy piss talk that only potentially half of all people on Earth can relate to as well.
[56:20.750 --> 56:22.850]  Because it's male piss talk.
[56:23.230 --> 56:26.150]  But we could have female, like a woman could pee through a mug.
[56:26.710 --> 56:30.530]  Yeah, but you know, the urinal etiquette doesn't come into play.
[56:30.790 --> 56:33.710]  That's true, that's true. Totally true. Totally true.
[56:34.350 --> 56:36.850]  I wonder how, man, it's too bad we don't do,
[56:37.130 --> 56:39.130]  we don't have guests or interviews on this podcast.
[56:39.230 --> 56:45.050]  Because I'd love to interview a female about what the etiquette's like in women's bathrooms.
[56:45.270 --> 56:48.810]  I mean, you can just do that.
[56:48.930 --> 56:53.270]  I don't see why, like, there has to be a precedent for this on this fucking show.
[56:53.950 --> 56:58.550]  Also, that you need a structure of a show to have that conversation.
[56:59.150 --> 57:00.550]  You can just get that info.
[57:01.290 --> 57:01.890]  I don't understand.
[57:02.410 --> 57:03.290]  Absolute operation.
[57:03.430 --> 57:05.910]  Like, we need to find ourselves a female to talk.
[57:06.470 --> 57:09.070]  Like, half of this episode is about Bovril.
[57:09.230 --> 57:11.550]  You can do whatever the fuck you want in this show.
[57:11.770 --> 57:13.050]  I guess that's true.
[57:13.650 --> 57:13.990]  Yeah.
[57:14.690 --> 57:15.910]  I don't know if I care that much.
[57:22.070 --> 57:24.350]  The Bovril saga, who saw that coming?
[57:24.910 --> 57:25.830]  I didn't know it existed.
[57:26.450 --> 57:29.270]  Andrew, you should go across the street and see if they have any.
[57:29.330 --> 57:30.970]  I should, I should look, yeah.
[57:31.170 --> 57:32.330]  I'll go to that store.
[57:33.130 --> 57:33.690]  I'll look it up.
[57:34.870 --> 57:35.270]  Bovril.
[57:36.630 --> 57:40.430]  I don't think there's a thing I would enjoy less in Paste.
[57:41.210 --> 57:44.130]  Like, if you gave me an option of putting a thing in Paste,
[57:44.610 --> 57:46.090]  meat would be pretty low tier.
[57:46.650 --> 57:47.730]  It's just, like, an edible thing.
[57:47.890 --> 57:48.610]  Yeah, meat and fish.
[57:49.070 --> 57:51.410]  I can't think of anything else that you...
[57:51.410 --> 57:54.970]  When I googled it, there's images of it being spread on toast,
[57:55.150 --> 57:57.230]  and also images of people drinking it.
[57:57.310 --> 57:59.450]  I can't think of many products where it's a spread.
[57:59.570 --> 58:01.830]  Yeah, I don't think I've ever had, like, the Bovril spread.
[58:02.290 --> 58:03.510]  Okay, we're talking Bovril again.
[58:03.550 --> 58:07.130]  I tuned out for a second, and then we were talking about putting piss on toast.
[58:07.250 --> 58:07.430]  Okay.
[58:11.170 --> 58:12.970]  You gotta melt the butter someway, Geoff.
[58:13.390 --> 58:14.190]  Oh, man.
[58:16.150 --> 58:17.670]  Well, I think I'm Bovril'd out.
[58:17.750 --> 58:19.470]  I don't think I have any more Bovril content.
[58:20.730 --> 58:21.690]  Here's a question for you,
[58:22.030 --> 58:24.910]  because we're about to record episode 99.
[58:25.070 --> 58:26.230]  We're about to jump right into it.
[58:26.390 --> 58:27.490]  Do you guys have stuff for it?
[58:27.830 --> 58:29.470]  You guys got any shit you want to talk about 99?
[58:29.810 --> 58:30.930]  I have a little thing.
[58:31.430 --> 58:33.750]  I have something I want to talk about in this episode
[58:33.750 --> 58:35.510]  that I just remembered that we should...
[58:35.510 --> 58:35.850]  Absolutely.
[58:36.270 --> 58:36.310]  What?
[58:36.910 --> 58:38.030]  I have stuff for next episode, too.
[58:38.030 --> 58:38.730]  But this was the wrap-up.
[58:38.730 --> 58:40.610]  I know, this is a tiny thing.
[58:40.690 --> 58:42.070]  Just fucking calm down, Eric.
[58:42.150 --> 58:42.630]  You're gonna see...
[58:42.630 --> 58:43.170]  But this was...
[58:43.170 --> 58:44.810]  No, because this happens all the time.
[58:44.890 --> 58:45.770]  No, I understand.
[58:46.030 --> 58:47.290]  This happens specifically with you.
[58:47.770 --> 58:48.190]  That's fair.
[58:48.370 --> 58:48.810]  I hear you.
[58:50.170 --> 58:51.390]  This is a tiny thing.
[58:51.470 --> 58:52.050]  It's gonna fit.
[58:52.310 --> 58:54.410]  It's not tiny, but it'll fit within this.
[58:54.470 --> 58:55.450]  The significance of it.
[58:55.810 --> 58:58.890]  I want to thank everybody that put us into Reddit Place.
[58:59.410 --> 59:00.390]  That was really cool to see.
[59:00.770 --> 59:01.110]  Oh, shit.
[59:02.150 --> 59:03.450]  There's a whole thing that was going on.
[59:03.530 --> 59:05.950]  I wasn't as involved with it as I'd like to be.
[59:06.010 --> 59:07.170]  Reddit Place was this.
[59:07.170 --> 59:10.010]  I don't even know if necessarily I'm qualified to explain it.
[59:10.070 --> 59:12.830]  If I say this wrong, if you know more, feel free to correct me.
[59:13.150 --> 59:15.750]  It is a thing that Reddit brought back for April Fool's.
[59:16.090 --> 59:21.510]  It was like this giant wall where people could submit tiles of colors and make art on it.
[59:21.570 --> 59:23.330]  But you can only do it once every five minutes.
[59:23.510 --> 59:25.470]  And it was this board that had limited spaces.
[59:25.570 --> 59:27.050]  So people were like fighting for spaces.
[59:27.330 --> 59:28.990]  It got strangely political.
[59:29.630 --> 59:30.390]  We're like...
[59:30.390 --> 59:31.950]  From what I could tell, the f***ing thing.
[59:32.070 --> 59:35.250]  They made alliances with the Halo people and the Doom people.
[59:36.670 --> 59:37.470]  Another subreddit.
[59:37.670 --> 59:39.890]  And the Poland Ball people, I think, as well.
[59:39.910 --> 59:41.390]  Yeah, I think Poland was involved.
[59:41.910 --> 59:47.290]  It's this very interesting thing that is awesome in the sense that it makes other communities
[59:47.290 --> 59:51.470]  that would never interact become friends and kind of unite over a period of time.
[59:52.390 --> 59:53.750]  And f***face was on.
[59:53.810 --> 59:56.590]  I should have grabbed the screenshot of our place.
[59:56.770 --> 59:57.450]  Oh, that'd be...
[59:57.450 --> 59:58.610]  If you could post it, that'd be awesome.
[59:58.810 --> 01:00:01.190]  But I just wanted to thank all the people that spent...
[01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:04.770]  It was like a three or four day thing where they had to rally and fight people against
[01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:05.830]  Defend the Space.
[01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:07.050]  It was very cool.
[01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:11.230]  Yeah, I wasn't in the Discord discussing it and all that shit.
[01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:13.610]  But it was when we were on tour, Gavin.
[01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:17.290]  And so I had it up on my phone the entire time we were on tour.
[01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:19.770]  And I was helping defend not only f***face.
[01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:23.910]  I was also helping defend Red vs Blue and RWBY because they were on there as well.
[01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:25.970]  And it was so much fun.
[01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:26.630]  It was like...
[01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:29.950]  I had alerts set up so that every five minutes my phone would ding and it would remind me
[01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:31.750]  to go put another tile down.
[01:00:31.830 --> 01:00:32.790]  Because there was a couple...
[01:00:32.790 --> 01:00:33.950]  There was like a full two days.
[01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:36.130]  People were just trying to f*** with RVB.
[01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:37.430]  And I was trying to hold that back.
[01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:40.530]  But the f***face community was awesome.
[01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:41.330]  They were really cool.
[01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:42.610]  It was wonderful.
[01:00:42.850 --> 01:00:43.770]  All the people that did that.
[01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:44.450]  Thank you so much.
[01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:47.190]  It was funny too because I didn't...
[01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:48.610]  So I was sort of like you, Geoff.
[01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:49.690]  Where I was in and out of it.
[01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:51.030]  I didn't really know what was going on.
[01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:52.470]  They added...
[01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:54.830]  So we had a border where it said the name of our show.
[01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:56.590]  And then it was surrounded by pencils.
[01:00:57.210 --> 01:00:58.630]  And then they added another pencil.
[01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:00.850]  And so I looked at it and I was like,
[01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:02.170]  Oh, that pencil has like...
[01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:03.090]  It's missing a piece.
[01:01:03.090 --> 01:01:04.050]  I have a tile.
[01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:05.030]  I'll put the piece back.
[01:01:05.110 --> 01:01:05.950]  So I put it back.
[01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:10.110]  What I didn't realize is that that pencil was made against an alliance.
[01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.950]  I think it was Poland.
[01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:13.110]  It went against the Polish alliance.
[01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:13.630]  Yeah.
[01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:15.570]  And so they're trying to get rid of the pencil.
[01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:17.690]  And I had just further stated it.
[01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:20.130]  And then people were like, well, Andrew's building the pencil.
[01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:21.230]  Like f*** the alliance.
[01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:22.310]  Like we got to keep...
[01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:25.050]  I accidentally created all this conflict because I'm dumb.
[01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:26.850]  And so then I had to step in and be like,
[01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:28.150]  No, just get rid of the...
[01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.750]  Follow the alliances.
[01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:29.590]  I don't know anything.
[01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:30.710]  I was just trying to help.
[01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:32.110]  So you accidentally invaded Poland?
[01:01:32.110 --> 01:01:36.050]  I accidentally led a charge in continuing to invade Poland.
[01:01:36.810 --> 01:01:38.010]  Historically a bad move.
[01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:39.750]  Yeah. Not great.
[01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:45.650]  And I will say that the final form of the f*** face was the f*** face logo with the pencil border
[01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:48.530]  and then one giant pencil with a bite taken out of it.
[01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:50.070]  And I thought that was phenomenal.
[01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:51.030]  Very funny.
[01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:52.210]  Very good.
[01:01:52.890 --> 01:01:53.670]  Very good.
[01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:59.330]  It was nice to see a lot of regulation listeners and comment leavers at the live shows we just did.
[01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:00.090]  It was.
[01:02:00.210 --> 01:02:00.450]  It was.
[01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:01.850]  Oh, that's...
[01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:02.330]  Well, you know what?
[01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:03.570]  We'll talk about it in episode 99.
[01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:04.610]  I forgot about it.
[01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:05.710]  But we do have some f*** face.
[01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:08.270]  We had some f*** face interactions during the tour.
[01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:12.850]  Every night of the tour that we should probably discuss because it's germane to this podcast.
[01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.390]  Okay.
[01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:13.730]  All right.
[01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:14.510]  Good deal.
[01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:15.850]  Are you happy with that, Eric?
[01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:16.890]  Did that fit in nicely?
[01:02:17.050 --> 01:02:17.710]  Like I said?
[01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:18.850]  Is that good?
[01:02:19.210 --> 01:02:20.170]  Yeah, that'll...
[01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:21.430]  I mean, that'll take us to time.
[01:02:21.590 --> 01:02:22.330]  It's just, you know...
[01:02:22.330 --> 01:02:22.710]  Yeah, that's fine.
[01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:23.250]  It's great.
[01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:23.670]  It's good.
[01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:24.170]  I loved it.
[01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:25.310]  Andrew, I loved it.
[01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:26.050]  Check this out.
[01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:27.810]  I'm going to do the best outro we've ever done.
[01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:28.810]  I'm going to be super professional.
[01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:29.130]  Okay.
[01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:31.090]  I don't know if Eric shot this episode.
[01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:33.330]  Yeah, Eric, how's your tummy?
[01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:34.250]  Did you go poopy?
[01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:37.710]  I rolled around on the ground for a little while, but I just turned my headphones up.
[01:02:37.810 --> 01:02:39.090]  So I'm good now.
[01:02:39.350 --> 01:02:40.390]  Okay, that's good.
[01:02:40.810 --> 01:02:43.110]  Well, hey, audience, thank you.
[01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:45.550]  You have listened to another episode of f*** face.
[01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:48.130]  This was the 98th iteration of this nonsense.
[01:02:48.310 --> 01:02:50.650]  We sure do appreciate you tuning in.
[01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:55.330]  If you liked it enough to listen again, maybe you could recommend it to a friend or an enemy.
[01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:56.770]  We're not particular.
[01:02:56.770 --> 01:03:03.570]  And then also, if you feel like writing a review or giving us a rating on whatever podcast platform
[01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:07.050]  of your choices, that would also be peachy keen.
[01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:08.270]  And if you don't, that's okay.
[01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:10.910]  We appreciate you just listening because we love you.
[01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:13.590]  And we hope you have a fantastic week.
[01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:14.630]  See you next time.
[01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:15.330]  Bye.
[01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:16.190]  Hey, guys.
[01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:19.650]  Minor League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of f*** face.
[01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:22.350]  Episode 99 is coming in gross.
[01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:24.150]  The gang goes x-rated.
[01:03:24.610 --> 01:03:26.270]  Andrew's mom did not need that.
[01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:27.970]  We've got Gerpler developments.
[01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:30.050]  Geoff has a new golden toy.
[01:03:30.490 --> 01:03:32.070]  Gavin is all about the Bobrill.
[01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:34.710]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:03:35.170 --> 01:03:37.870]  All that and more on next week's episode of f*** face.
