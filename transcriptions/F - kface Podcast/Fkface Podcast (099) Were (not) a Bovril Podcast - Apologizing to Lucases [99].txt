[00:05.080 --> 00:09.900]  Uh, hi! This is the beginning of the episode that comes out next week. It's doozy, we talk
[00:09.900 --> 00:13.980]  about lactating women, we talk about all sorts of things, but the thing I'm here to talk
[00:13.980 --> 00:20.160]  to you about is we're selling the baseballs. They're coming out on Friday on store.roosterteeth.com.
[00:20.260 --> 00:24.560]  They will sell out very quickly, but I realize we never talked about them on the show. We've
[00:24.560 --> 00:28.180]  only mentioned it on social media. If you want to follow us on social media, we have
[00:28.180 --> 00:33.600]  an Instagram account at f***facepod. I believe in a Twitter account with I think the same
[00:33.600 --> 00:37.500]  name at f***facepod. I also have a YouTube, but you wouldn't find that out there. Anyway,
[00:37.740 --> 00:53.670]  thank you. Bye, baseball. Previously on f***face. Hello and welcome to another episode of the
[00:53.670 --> 01:00.670]  f***face podcast. This is number 99. We are in season four, still year two, I believe.
[01:01.190 --> 01:07.130]  Really closing in on that episode 100. We are moments away. With me as always, Andrew
[01:07.130 --> 01:14.910]  Panton and Gavin Free. How's it going, dipshits? I'd say it's going well. I'm still thinking
[01:14.910 --> 01:19.230]  about Bovril because we just recorded that one. I'm sure everybody else who's listening
[01:19.230 --> 01:23.550]  is equally haunted by it and it has stuck with them. Maybe some have tried it. I did
[01:23.550 --> 01:29.450]  not need to know that shit existed. That was, whoa. I think you'd be surprised at how good
[01:29.450 --> 01:35.130]  it is. What? Like I was surprised it exists. I'm already surprised. Yeah. Hard to get more
[01:35.130 --> 01:38.670]  surprised. It's not bad. It's not bad. If anything, Geoff, you should, you'll probably
[01:38.670 --> 01:42.710]  like it because the opposite of the color you hate. Yeah, I guess that's true. It is
[01:42.710 --> 01:48.130]  true. That's fair. That is true. And I mean, there's a whole Bovril industry, right? So
[01:48.130 --> 01:55.730]  clearly there's a market for it. Bovril industry. You're not wrong, but it's just, it's a weird
[01:55.730 --> 02:04.010]  I wonder what the annual Bovril industry is worth. Yeah. Like what are the global Bovril
[02:04.010 --> 02:09.670]  sales for 2021? Uh, I'm a Google that real fast. You guys talk. I'm a Google that.
[02:12.350 --> 02:20.010]  Global Bovril sales for 2021. Higher or lower than salad cream? Do you think Gavin? Oh,
[02:20.230 --> 02:25.490]  lower. Lower, not as popular. Okay. I have no point of reference for these things. So it's
[02:25.490 --> 02:33.390]  interesting. Jesus Christ. Let us let Google returned. By 1968, the Bovril empire owned
[02:33.390 --> 02:38.190]  Argentinian beef ranches that totaled the equivalent of half the size of England.
[02:38.570 --> 02:44.070]  Production was also moved from London to its current home in Burton-on-Trent. Today,
[02:44.250 --> 02:50.570]  Bovril is as popular as ever providing three and a half million jars to Brits every year.
[02:50.570 --> 02:54.630]  So they were just liquefying Argentinian cows? Is that what you're saying?
[02:54.870 --> 02:59.990]  Seems to be the case. They must have like a big Bovril grinder and they just push the
[02:59.990 --> 03:04.570]  cows in and then out comes the juice. We're a Bovril podcast.
[03:06.810 --> 03:14.190]  Oh shit, dude. In 2004, Bovril drops the beef to go vegetarian. They didn't do that. I mean,
[03:14.190 --> 03:18.130]  wouldn't that just be Marmite or Vegemite? I don't know. Let me look into the Bovril
[03:18.130 --> 03:24.850]  Wikipedia. Oh God. Recipe changes. Okay, here we go. It was promoted as a superfood in the early
[03:24.850 --> 03:30.530]  20th century. Advertisements for Bovril recommended people dilute it into a tea or spread it on their
[03:30.530 --> 03:34.410]  morning toast. Disgusting. Some adverts even claimed that Bovril could protect one from
[03:34.410 --> 03:39.930]  influenza. Since its invention, Bovril has become an icon of British culture and it is associated
[03:39.930 --> 03:44.190]  with football culture. So you were right there, Gavin. During the winter, Bovril football fans
[03:44.190 --> 03:48.470]  in stadiums and terraces drink it as a tea from thermos flasks or from disposable cups
[03:49.170 --> 03:55.990]  in Scotland where thermoses are banned. No fucking thermoses in Scotland. No doorknobs in Vancouver,
[03:56.110 --> 04:01.190]  no thermoses in Scotland. What's interesting is the prevention of influenza is also what they
[04:01.190 --> 04:05.650]  said about buttplugs. So really this circles in multiple ways. I thought that was night blindness.
[04:06.330 --> 04:13.630]  Oh, it's everything. Buttplugs originally cure it all. In 2004, Unilever, which is very close to
[04:13.630 --> 04:19.450]  Unifarm, removed the beef ingredients from Bovril, rendering it vegetarian. This was mainly due to
[04:19.450 --> 04:24.610]  concerns about decreasing sales, particularly from exports due to an export ban on British beef.
[04:25.170 --> 04:31.450]  As a result of that growing popularity of vegetarianism, religious dietary requirements
[04:31.450 --> 04:38.010]  and public concerns about, well, about fucking mad cow disease. In 2006, Unilever reversed that.
[04:38.690 --> 04:45.110]  Fuck, excuse me, I burped in the intro. In 2006, Unilever reversed that decision and introduced
[04:45.110 --> 04:51.010]  or reintroduced beef back to the Bovril formula once sales increased and the export bans were
[04:51.010 --> 04:56.710]  lifted. Unilever now produces Bovril using beef extract and a chicken variety using chicken
[04:56.710 --> 05:01.150]  extract. We should try all the Bovril's, like what's better, the veggie one or the beef or
[05:01.150 --> 05:07.030]  the chicken? Like a Cosmic Cruise review? Yeah. Do you know who the Forest Green Rovers Football
[05:07.030 --> 05:13.230]  Club is, Gavin? No. Oh, I don't either. I assume that there was British. In November 2020,
[05:13.530 --> 05:20.590]  they announced a collaboration with the makers of Bovril to create a BEET version of Bovril to
[05:20.590 --> 05:25.970]  be sold in the New Lawn Stadium, where meat-based products had been removed. Exclusive. Who would
[05:25.970 --> 05:30.330]  have thought a mad cow had a knock-on effect on all the... yeah, I guess it makes total sense.
[05:30.770 --> 05:35.930]  Yeah. I can't give blood here because of that. Because you have mad cow disease? Yeah, they don't
[05:35.930 --> 05:42.310]  want my filthy British blood in their banks because of mad cow. I can't give blood anymore
[05:42.310 --> 05:49.510]  because I have too many tattoos, I was told. Oh, wow. Andrew, can you give blood? I should really
[05:49.510 --> 05:53.510]  try. It's actually a thing I've been meaning to look into. There's a rally for it happening in
[05:53.510 --> 05:58.130]  the near future where I live, and I was gonna look into that. I've never tried. I don't know
[05:58.130 --> 06:03.630]  why I'd be rejected. Although, could it be a weird... do you have to have, like, O blood?
[06:03.630 --> 06:08.810]  Like, do you have any blood acceptable? Well, some blood's more valuable than others, but...
[06:08.810 --> 06:14.930]  For sure. Yeah. Because I know... All blood is good blood. I imagine it's like a different...
[06:14.930 --> 06:20.250]  I feel like I've heard when you try to, like, going to a sperm bank, you have to hit a lot
[06:20.250 --> 06:25.410]  of requirements, like, to get approved for that. I feel like the requirements are very stringent
[06:25.410 --> 06:29.750]  from what I've heard. Well, but how do they know that before you monk off into a cup? How do they
[06:29.750 --> 06:34.270]  know if you qualify? Well, I think you have to go through some things, and then I think maybe...
[06:34.270 --> 06:38.030]  I don't know the process of it. From my understanding, you need to essentially have,
[06:38.130 --> 06:44.790]  like, super... I don't want to further make this harder to get sponsored a junior hockey team,
[06:45.230 --> 06:50.890]  but from what I've heard, you need essentially super cum to get approved from a sperm bank.
[06:51.710 --> 06:57.210]  That's just what I've heard. I don't know how any of that works. I don't know.
[06:57.210 --> 07:01.970]  I think you're right, Andrew. They don't want scrub sperm. They want to make sure
[07:01.970 --> 07:05.150]  it's genetically good, that you're not, like, predisposed to have, like,
[07:05.190 --> 07:08.670]  four million different issues. And then also, I think most of those places...
[07:08.670 --> 07:09.570]  They just fill out a form, and they...
[07:09.570 --> 07:15.850]  Well, I think maybe they can get data from the sample. I don't know. Like,
[07:15.930 --> 07:20.210]  maybe it's a doctor's thing, but you need to be clear. Like, you need to have a really good
[07:20.790 --> 07:26.250]  medical history. And I think maybe potency? Maybe it's sperm count? Like,
[07:26.250 --> 07:27.790]  I think there are multiple layers.
[07:27.890 --> 07:30.290]  So it's all decided after the specimen?
[07:30.950 --> 07:34.230]  Yes. It's not pre. I think you do a pre-interview. I'm sure there's, like,
[07:34.230 --> 07:39.450]  some medicals that you go through, but I think it's post-sample. That's what I'm trying to
[07:39.450 --> 07:43.390]  remember. I feel like I heard a story where somebody, like, wanted to do that because they'd
[07:43.390 --> 07:47.050]  get paid for it, and then they went through the whole process, and they were told they
[07:47.050 --> 07:47.670]  weren't good enough.
[07:48.010 --> 07:51.870]  I think they also have, like, requirements, too. Like, you have to have a college degree,
[07:51.870 --> 07:56.450]  and be free. Like, seriously. Like, they don't want, like, the fucking dumb sperm.
[07:56.890 --> 07:57.530]  Yeah, yeah.
[07:57.830 --> 07:58.630]  That's interesting.
[07:59.110 --> 08:03.510]  Yeah, but does my knowledge get passed down in my sperm? What the hell does that even mean?
[08:03.870 --> 08:04.350]  I don't know.
[08:04.970 --> 08:09.270]  It's like a thorough... they want thoroughbreds only, Gavin. They need to... it needs to be
[08:09.890 --> 08:10.950]  a high quality.
[08:11.190 --> 08:14.550]  Like, I'm passing down knowledge to my jizz.
[08:16.110 --> 08:21.250]  How using donor sperm works. Donor evaluation. The health and safety of donors and recipients
[08:21.250 --> 08:26.830]  are paramount to the donation process. Donors must be under 40, free of communicable diseases,
[08:27.350 --> 08:32.810]  and without a family history of genetic disorder. They do a semen analysis to determine its
[08:32.810 --> 08:37.890]  usability. It must be able to withstand freezing storage and thawing while remaining viable.
[08:38.450 --> 08:43.270]  Before using the sperm, it needs to undergo quarantine and frozen storage for at least
[08:43.270 --> 08:49.030]  six months. The donor must again test negative for communicable diseases after the six-month
[08:49.030 --> 08:54.330]  quarantine period before the sperm is available for use. Sperm banks offer anonymous information
[08:54.330 --> 08:59.350]  about donors, including interests, aptitudes, and physical characteristics. Parents can also
[08:59.350 --> 09:02.930]  use a known donor or someone they know. Sperm bank donors remain anonymous throughout the process.
[09:03.230 --> 09:05.070]  However, known donors do not.
[09:05.850 --> 09:09.810]  So I'm right. I just said it horribly, but I was correct. I didn't know any of the information,
[09:09.990 --> 09:16.530]  the specifics, but I was in the right direction. I'm trying to think of like
[09:17.290 --> 09:22.890]  how... I mean, I already said Supercum. We're already pretty low tier as far as sponsoring
[09:22.890 --> 09:27.930]  junior hockey goes. I had another great conversation with my mom recently.
[09:28.450 --> 09:29.410]  Oh, is there an update?
[09:29.790 --> 09:37.770]  There is an update. This isn't about butt plucks. I talked to my mom about
[09:39.670 --> 09:47.350]  lactating women kinks was the conversation because it was a subreddit post where I live.
[09:47.930 --> 09:49.470]  Lactating women kinks?
[09:49.730 --> 09:51.530]  Yes. There's somebody that posted...
[09:51.530 --> 09:53.510]  So they use the milk from tits?
[09:53.650 --> 10:00.650]  I don't know what they do with it. It was a post on the subreddit and it was somebody
[10:00.650 --> 10:07.750]  who would be like, hey, I'm trying to... and this person was very serious. I have a
[10:07.750 --> 10:13.270]  ways that I could figure this out type thing. How I could solve this issue.
[10:14.470 --> 10:16.990]  Solve what? How do I get access to women who are lactating on me?
[10:16.990 --> 10:22.710]  How do I get access to lactating women was essentially the post, I would say. It was
[10:22.710 --> 10:28.030]  very odd. It was one of the stranger posts I've seen.
[10:28.070 --> 10:30.690]  This is virgin black market shit.
[10:32.030 --> 10:36.790]  But it wasn't negative in that way. It was just like, hey, are there services that I could...
[10:36.790 --> 10:37.410]  I don't know.
[10:37.850 --> 10:41.390]  I guess your best bet would be to hang out at the prenatal ward in a hospital.
[10:41.950 --> 10:43.170]  I mean, that's what you'd hope for.
[10:43.390 --> 10:43.690]  Yeah.
[10:43.890 --> 10:48.670]  What made me laugh... I should have told this the other way. Before, previous my post
[10:48.670 --> 10:53.450]  favorite or the post I enjoyed the most that was on subreddit before was somebody posted
[10:53.450 --> 10:59.410]  this thing saying every night downtown, we have a get together from 7 p.m. until like
[10:59.410 --> 11:04.530]  10 p.m. Come hang out if you want to. And it was just a video of dudes twirling fire
[11:04.530 --> 11:10.790]  sticks and like this little gazebo with like Spencer's Gifts type lights just shining around
[11:10.790 --> 11:14.750]  them. I was like, this is what a fucking weird thing that'd be to walk into.
[11:15.070 --> 11:20.270]  And then I looked at I clicked the post and the top comment was alcohol and 420 friendly.
[11:20.610 --> 11:25.730]  Like there would need to be a clarification that the fire stick twirlers, Spencer Gifts.
[11:25.950 --> 11:29.210]  Like it was one of the funniest clarifications I've ever seen.
[11:29.350 --> 11:31.510]  Like somebody be like, oh, I hope they'd be OK with this.
[11:32.490 --> 11:37.810]  So then I learned that the person that made that post was the lactating milk guy because I went
[11:37.810 --> 11:41.970]  into their post history because I'm like, what else is in here? If that's there, there has to
[11:41.970 --> 11:46.450]  be some wild shit in their post history. And I found that and I was very excited. It was the
[11:46.450 --> 11:51.350]  same guy. So then I thought, oh, this is a funny it's a funny thing. I was going to tell my mom
[11:51.350 --> 11:56.850]  about it. So it's talking about the fire thing. And I was like, yeah, it said on the post that
[11:56.850 --> 12:03.190]  they're alcohol and 420 friendly. And my mom had no idea what 420 was like. She'd never heard of
[12:03.190 --> 12:10.210]  420. And so then I had to explain what 420 was. But my initial thought was she's going to have
[12:10.210 --> 12:16.710]  no clue what a lactating woman kink is. If we're if the 420 is the barrier of entry,
[12:17.410 --> 12:24.810]  then have to explain that. So then I explain that to my mom. And what's wrong, Eric?
[12:24.810 --> 12:31.130]  Eric's having a breakdown in the chat. I can't I can't believe that lactating woman kink is the
[12:31.130 --> 12:37.550]  long walk that we just took to explaining to your mom what 420 was part of the same thing.
[12:37.770 --> 12:44.530]  I thought it was funny, right? Because I thought to go so insane at the beginning to dial it all
[12:44.530 --> 12:51.110]  the way back to 420 means we is like, no, you're right. Wild. You're totally right.
[12:51.110 --> 12:52.810]  That was like the opposite of clickbait.
[12:52.930 --> 12:59.790]  I fucked up. I told the story in the wrong order. A hundred percent. That's my fault.
[13:01.250 --> 13:02.910]  Well, it is your redemption year. You want to start over?
[13:03.330 --> 13:07.190]  No, no, we're good. We could just we moved past it. But I just it was more funny to me
[13:07.190 --> 13:11.710]  that I was like, I wonder if she knows what this is. Considering she didn't know the buttplug thing
[13:11.710 --> 13:14.830]  was where my mind was at and seeing her reaction to it, I thought would be funny.
[13:15.150 --> 13:18.250]  She didn't even know what 420 was. So there's a hurdle to clear there.
[13:18.250 --> 13:22.910]  She had no idea. She did. She was disgusted equally with the buttplugs as the lactating
[13:22.910 --> 13:27.330]  woman doesn't understand any of it. She paused. There was like a moment of processing
[13:27.830 --> 13:33.030]  and then was like, I wonder, I wonder if he likes sugar cookies is all she said.
[13:33.170 --> 13:37.570]  And then we never addressed it again. So I think in her head, it's like a consumption.
[13:38.330 --> 13:42.050]  It's the consumption thing. I don't think she understands what the kink is.
[13:42.490 --> 13:46.590]  Does your mom think breast milk tastes like sugar cookies? Does breast milk taste like sugar
[13:46.590 --> 13:51.490]  cookies? I think she was thinking her brain, I think, went like, I wonder if he would have it
[13:51.490 --> 13:56.070]  in cookies. And then it went the sugar cookie. I don't know. I can't explain why her brain went
[13:56.070 --> 13:59.970]  there. But it's a very funny thing of she was stunned, didn't really know what to say.
[14:00.030 --> 14:03.490]  We're both quiet for a minute. And then she just said that. And we moved on.
[14:05.570 --> 14:12.170]  Just moved on from it. We just moved on. There's no other. That was there been some weird. That's
[14:12.170 --> 14:16.890]  not the most awkward. Have you seen like a movie with your parents? There's like,
[14:17.950 --> 14:25.690]  that's I regret that. Yeah, I was awkward. Got a lifetime, an entire lifetime of that experience.
[14:25.930 --> 14:29.370]  It could be. What's the worst one you've had? Because I feel like I have an all bad one.
[14:29.610 --> 14:35.310]  I had one recently, not recently. It was about 10 years ago. I went home to Alabama because my dad
[14:35.310 --> 14:43.710]  died. And so it was like the week my dad died, I was just trying to laugh. And so I put on an
[14:43.710 --> 14:47.910]  episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. And my mom sat down to watch it with me.
[14:48.170 --> 14:53.510]  And it was the episode where they faked the death of a small child to get away from the IRS.
[14:53.910 --> 14:58.710]  And they had a I don't remember what it was, some dead animal in a coffin. And they flipped
[14:58.710 --> 15:01.990]  the coffin over and the dead animal fell out. And I just looked at my mom and I was like,
[15:01.990 --> 15:04.570]  this was not the time for this fucking episode.
[15:07.750 --> 15:11.270]  Yeah, it was a real mood killer. Real mood killer.
[15:13.650 --> 15:16.850]  That's so bad. Okay, your turn. Do you have one Gavin?
[15:17.710 --> 15:21.670]  Just like watching Uncomfortable Stuff. I remember I watched Titanic as a child.
[15:22.530 --> 15:26.890]  There's that bit where they're shagging in the car, like in the cargo area.
[15:27.510 --> 15:31.970]  They'll come up all sweaty. There's like steam on the windows. And I remember when I was a kid,
[15:32.570 --> 15:37.950]  just asking my parents, I was like, what happened? Why are they wet? And my mom was like,
[15:38.170 --> 15:44.870]  they went swimming before this scene. And I was like, okay. And then it was like 15 years later,
[15:44.970 --> 15:50.030]  I watched it again. I was like, wait a second. Like I didn't, I didn't ever put it together in
[15:50.030 --> 15:54.250]  the meantime that, uh, they were just shagging in a car and they lied to me. I just assumed it
[15:54.250 --> 15:58.730]  burned in to my brain wrong that they actually went for a swim. I was like, wait, there was no
[15:58.730 --> 16:06.610]  pool. My worst one. This is so bad. So I, I, my mom and I would go to the movies all the time.
[16:06.610 --> 16:11.870]  It was like one of our main bonding things that we used to do, uh, quite a bit. And so we'd see
[16:11.870 --> 16:17.010]  everything, anything that looked good, we would go see. And one of the movies we saw together was
[16:17.010 --> 16:23.290]  Don John. And I don't know how familiar either of you are with Don John. It was a Joseph Gordon
[16:23.290 --> 16:29.110]  Levent movie. I believe he wrote and directed it as well. And it's about a guy that is struggling
[16:29.110 --> 16:33.310]  with a porn addiction. And so I was like, obviously it's going to touch on that subject
[16:33.310 --> 16:40.850]  matter. The opening, the opening to Don John is just straight up pornography, just like snippets
[16:40.850 --> 16:46.190]  and scenes from just like they pulled from Pornhub or whatever. It's like legit porn in it. And so
[16:46.190 --> 16:49.670]  I'm like watching, I'm prepared. I got the popcorn ready. It's like, ah, there's probably
[16:49.670 --> 16:53.990]  going to be some awkward sex stuff in this. And you're with your mom knowing. And I'm with my mom.
[16:54.490 --> 16:58.650]  Yeah. Like I just, it's like, we can get over it. It's whatever. It's a movie. It's none of that.
[16:58.750 --> 17:04.030]  Whatever. We can get through this. And it opens with porn, just straight up porn. And it was the
[17:04.030 --> 17:09.890]  most uncomfortable movie experience I've ever had. But it was like, no, it was zero story.
[17:10.110 --> 17:14.810]  You couldn't just like get into some parts of it. It was just porn immediately. Did you write
[17:14.810 --> 17:21.550]  looking at the screen or? I just a thousand yards stare forward. I'm in a space all by myself.
[17:21.750 --> 17:26.830]  Nobody else is in this room. It was terrible. It was, I wanted to die. What was your mom's reaction?
[17:27.170 --> 17:31.310]  I don't know. I couldn't tell you. I was looking forward. It was just, we never talked about it.
[17:31.370 --> 17:35.830]  We like just talked about the movie as a whole outside of that, but it was very uncomfortable.
[17:36.050 --> 17:41.190]  I like that from, from our conversations. I know that there was no butt plugs in that porn.
[17:43.870 --> 17:44.890]  Or breast milk.
[17:47.150 --> 17:52.030]  It's a good movie, but it was like the most awkward viewing experience I've had. And I never
[17:52.030 --> 17:56.830]  thought that I'd be in a scenario in like a movie theater, just watching porn caught me off
[17:56.830 --> 18:02.770]  guard. It was a curve ball. I have another one that I will remember until the day I die. I was
[18:02.770 --> 18:07.990]  in high school and I was, this is when I got really into music and I was about 14. I discovered punk
[18:07.990 --> 18:12.730]  and I got like hard into music and it's all I cared about. And I was really into this band in
[18:12.730 --> 18:16.010]  the nineties and the eighties and the nineties called Fishbone because that's the age I was at.
[18:16.870 --> 18:24.270]  And they had this really upbeat, positive, like happy jingly song called Cholly. And I just liked
[18:24.270 --> 18:28.870]  it so much because it was just like, it was just like an up, up tempo kind of song. And I wanted
[18:28.870 --> 18:33.210]  to play it for my mom. So one day we were driving somewhere and I said, can I play this tape for you?
[18:33.510 --> 18:36.410]  I really think you'll like the song. And she's like, you know, I don't like your music. And I'm
[18:36.410 --> 18:39.830]  like, yeah, but this one's really happy and upbeat. It's not like, it's not like the, it's not like
[18:39.830 --> 18:43.450]  bad religion and all that like angsty shit I listened to. And she's like, yeah, I guess put it
[18:43.450 --> 18:50.010]  in. And I had been listening to this album for months and I had never paid attention to the
[18:50.010 --> 18:57.570]  lyrics to that song ever in my life. And I heard them for the first time as my mother heard them
[18:57.570 --> 19:03.670]  for the first time after I begged her to let me listen to the song. The song is about having sex
[19:03.670 --> 19:11.850]  with an overweight prostitute. And it's the lyrics are like, like, like, I love you, Charlie,
[19:11.930 --> 19:18.030]  when you're tickling my Wall-E. I love it, baby, when you shake your fat derriere. Make me feel
[19:18.030 --> 19:24.530]  good. We can watch the sunrise through your pig thighs. Like, my God. And it's just over and over
[19:24.530 --> 19:29.750]  and over again about fucking this chick. And my mom just got real quiet and I got real quiet and
[19:29.750 --> 19:35.790]  I didn't know what to do. So we listened to the entire song and then I just took the tape out and
[19:35.790 --> 19:43.270]  we never talked about it again. When you separate ways. Yeah. And I thought I am going to have to
[19:43.270 --> 19:47.030]  I remember I was like 16. I remember thinking I'm going to have to do a better job of vetting
[19:47.030 --> 19:54.990]  stuff in the future. Oh, that's terrible. I thought, how have I listened to this song
[19:55.550 --> 20:03.670]  4,000 times and never heard it? But that was the case. That's so much worse. You didn't get up and
[20:03.670 --> 20:09.790]  turn it off. Why? No, I was frozen in the moment. Yeah. Like you there's something about in a car.
[20:10.310 --> 20:16.110]  Yeah. Like there's no subtle way to do that. And to do that is an acknowledgement of the scenario.
[20:16.670 --> 20:21.530]  It's better to just like act like nothing happened. Just barrel through. And I also exist,
[20:21.530 --> 20:25.250]  especially at a younger age, to make other people uncomfortable. You know,
[20:25.370 --> 20:29.150]  I used to be way worse about it. So it was like in my wheelhouse. So I was kind of like
[20:29.770 --> 20:34.790]  like I kind of well, I was facing myself. Right. Like I had to do it because I'd started it. And
[20:34.790 --> 20:40.050]  I knew it was like maybe damaging my relationship with my mom. But it was also like this will be a
[20:40.050 --> 20:48.870]  story someday. And turns out it was 40 or 30 years later. Jesus. There's nothing I'm trying to like
[20:48.870 --> 20:54.010]  compare all the times that I've thought like, oh, this video, this YouTube video is funny. I'm going
[20:54.010 --> 20:59.090]  to show my friend and they just don't laugh at it. The anxiety of that and the wanting to die
[20:59.090 --> 21:04.410]  and that a hundred times worse being in a car with your mom just strapped into that. How long was the
[21:04.410 --> 21:08.850]  song? Oh, I don't know. It's like three minutes. Okay. It's not like two or three minutes. It's
[21:08.850 --> 21:14.250]  not the longest song in the world or anything, but it was just so long. Yeah. It was like I had never
[21:14.250 --> 21:19.450]  heard the song before until that moment. And then everything crystallized. And my mom definitely
[21:19.450 --> 21:26.090]  heard it. I watched her face go like concerned, glance over at me back at the road and just
[21:26.090 --> 21:31.910]  watch her body just turn off. She just went cold and like rigid. And I was just like,
[21:31.930 --> 21:40.290]  what am I doing? What am I doing to this lady? It's so much worse that you argued for it.
[21:40.750 --> 21:45.050]  No, I did. I had to convince her. Yeah. Because I was like so annoying about music and she was
[21:45.050 --> 21:48.610]  just like, I'm not going to like it. I don't want to hear your music. I get that you like it. It's
[21:48.610 --> 21:51.990]  not my generation. It's not for me. And I'm like, no, no, no, this one's a good one. It's happy.
[21:52.390 --> 21:56.870]  There's like a trombone and shit. You'll like it. How much time passed after that until you spoke
[21:56.870 --> 22:05.270]  again? I have no idea. Probably when we got where we were. I don't know. I just remember looking
[22:05.270 --> 22:14.190]  out the window a lot. Should we? Hey, should we talk? I'm sorry. No, you go. No, you go. No,
[22:14.230 --> 22:19.210]  you go. No, you go. I was going to completely change the topics. I don't know. Is this OK?
[22:19.350 --> 22:24.090]  Well, I'll talk about the thing I was going to talk about. I had a realization from a previous
[22:24.090 --> 22:30.330]  I saw a comment about this on, I guess, the one two episodes ago. I've been saying something wrong
[22:30.330 --> 22:36.410]  my entire life, and I've always been kind of like somewhat aware that it could be wrong.
[22:36.830 --> 22:42.450]  Oh, can I guess? Yeah, go ahead. Is it wheelbarrow? That's absolutely. Yes.
[22:45.010 --> 22:50.410]  So I said wheelbarrow. I've always thought it was wheelbarrow. I had no idea it was wheelbarrow.
[22:51.570 --> 22:56.730]  Wheelbarrow sounds weird to me. I said wheelbarrow. You guys didn't call me on it in the episode.
[22:56.730 --> 23:02.910]  I saw comments where people brought it up. And yeah, it's a weird as a weird one. And then I
[23:02.910 --> 23:09.210]  watched. This is like a strange sort of pivot, but same type of idea. Spoilers, I guess, for anybody
[23:09.210 --> 23:16.390]  who cares about Dexter. They made a new season of Dexter. And I realized that I completely
[23:16.930 --> 23:22.370]  misremembered how that show ended, which was very odd. Like that was the only value of watching the
[23:22.370 --> 23:27.970]  new season. A lot of the new season is about the fact that they don't know that he was a serial
[23:27.970 --> 23:33.790]  killer. And in my head, that's how that show ended, that everybody knew. Oh, like he got caught. Yeah,
[23:33.830 --> 23:38.970]  like he got caught and then he went into isolation. And so then to watch a whole series in which
[23:38.970 --> 23:43.930]  nobody knows that, but I thought everybody did was very strange. So I've been trying to be after
[23:43.930 --> 23:49.850]  the wheelbarrow wheelbarrow. I'm trying to think of things that I think are true or that I believe
[23:49.850 --> 23:56.090]  that are just completely wrong. It's been an exercise and I'm hoping to find more wheelbarrow
[23:56.090 --> 24:01.090]  wheelbarrow content. There's a lot of stuff like that where I don't pick up on it while we record,
[24:01.230 --> 24:05.530]  but then when I listen back, I'm like, oh, he definitely said wheelbarrow. Yeah, I feel like
[24:05.530 --> 24:11.030]  it sounds better. A wheelbarrow is fun to say. It's more fun than barrow. If it was a barrel on
[24:11.030 --> 24:16.270]  wheels, it would make sense. I feel like those exist as a wheel. I feel like I've seen that
[24:16.270 --> 24:24.470]  used as like a half a barrel as the barrow part. But wheelbarrow as a concept makes sense,
[24:24.570 --> 24:28.270]  right? It's like a barrel. You store stuff in a barrel, you put a wheel on it, you wheel it around.
[24:28.670 --> 24:33.190]  It's the same thing as a wheelbarrow. I get how you would get there. And they sound close enough
[24:33.190 --> 24:38.910]  that whenever I hear it, I just go in my head wheelbarrow. I go just adjust. What does your mom
[24:38.910 --> 24:44.350]  say? I have no idea. You should find out. I will. Next time I see her, I'll show her a photo of it.
[24:44.350 --> 24:49.590]  I'll say, what is this? Could have been a genetic thing that she passed down. Her eggs.
[24:53.650 --> 25:01.710]  Hey, should we... I had one of those that Gavin fixed me on. I never knew what the word... I had
[25:01.710 --> 25:05.970]  been misusing the word pent-ultimate my entire life until Gavin corrected me 10 years ago in
[25:05.970 --> 25:09.850]  Achiever Hunter. But you were using it double wrong. I was using it double wrong. You were
[25:09.850 --> 25:16.930]  using it in the wrong context and saying it wrong. Yeah. You were saying pent-ultimate as
[25:16.930 --> 25:22.450]  though it's like the ultimate. Yes. But it's not pronounced pent-ultimate. It's penultimate. And
[25:22.450 --> 25:29.810]  it means like one before. Yeah. And I was totally wrong on all fronts and you fixed me. Thank you.
[25:29.890 --> 25:37.230]  I appreciate that. But to be fair, you have a lot of good word knowledge. I guess being a journalist,
[25:37.230 --> 25:41.090]  you use a lot of words that I didn't know. Like, I feel like you will never turn down the
[25:41.090 --> 25:45.810]  opportunity to use the word assuage. You'll get that in there whenever you can. I do like that
[25:45.810 --> 25:51.870]  word. The fact that you didn't know penultimate. I just thought it's clearly a different, like an
[25:51.870 --> 25:56.730]  American thing. No. So I never corrected you on it for a while before I realized, oh, he is just
[25:56.730 --> 26:02.430]  using it wrong. I think where a lot of that comes from is my entire vocabulary comes from reading.
[26:02.670 --> 26:06.910]  And so when you read and you see a word you don't know, a lot of times you've figured out
[26:06.910 --> 26:11.670]  via context clues. And so sometimes you learn to pronounce it wrong because you read it first
[26:11.670 --> 26:18.350]  or you get the definition slightly askew from the actual definition just because you're picking up
[26:18.350 --> 26:23.030]  on the context clues wrong. There's probably a lot of those in my life, actually. Because there
[26:23.030 --> 26:30.910]  are some things between England and the US where the literal opposite thing means the same thing.
[26:31.050 --> 26:36.050]  So I would use the phrase, well, I couldn't care less. But people here might say, I could care
[26:36.050 --> 26:40.990]  less, which to me means, well, that's grammatically the opposite of what I'm saying. Like, you could
[26:40.990 --> 26:46.190]  care less. So why are you saying that? But just they use it in the same way. Should we talk about,
[26:46.550 --> 26:52.210]  because it is a germane, which is another good word, to this conversation. Should we talk about
[26:52.210 --> 26:59.270]  like the tour that Gavin and I went on and the face angle? So last week, Gavin and I went on,
[26:59.390 --> 27:04.130]  you know, for our other day job, the non-face job, we're a part of this gaming group called
[27:04.130 --> 27:09.370]  Achievement Hunter, which we definitely don't talk about on this podcast. But we had to do a
[27:09.370 --> 27:14.610]  West Coast tour. So we played shows in Seattle, and we played shows in San Francisco and a show
[27:14.610 --> 27:19.410]  in Los Angeles. And it's like a three hour kind of like, I don't know, like, would you say like a
[27:19.410 --> 27:27.970]  variety show, Gav? We do like roleplay and play video games, we play wrestling, some comedy,
[27:28.350 --> 27:33.190]  just a bunch of nonsense, right? Just a bunch of different presentations. And minor league fan
[27:33.190 --> 27:38.690]  Jack is the one who kind of spearheads that. It's kind of his creative baby. And so he penciled
[27:38.690 --> 27:43.250]  us in. Gavin and I in the past have always, you know, because we're buddies, as he has,
[27:43.330 --> 27:48.710]  he described last episode, I'm the best friend. I'm his best friend ever. Which feels really good
[27:48.710 --> 27:55.170]  to hear, man. Thanks. And I imagine that I imagine it would probably feel good for you to hear that
[27:55.170 --> 28:02.830]  back. And just knowing how good it felt to me. And so he penciled us in for like, we, you know,
[28:02.830 --> 28:07.370]  we have these big 20 minute, 15 minute productions that we do. And then we have little interstitials
[28:07.370 --> 28:12.010]  while we clear the stage or change costumes or whatever. And so Gavin and I in the past have
[28:12.010 --> 28:16.750]  always done like a dumb little five minute thing. One time he dared me to eat a bunch of olives. I
[28:16.750 --> 28:21.130]  couldn't do it in the time allotted. We used to throw gummy bears and try to catch them in each
[28:21.130 --> 28:25.730]  other's mouths. Just dumb shit. We played a game of nutball once. Nutball, yeah. So I figured there
[28:25.730 --> 28:29.230]  should be a f*** face angle for this. And by the way, we've met a lot of Regulation listeners,
[28:29.770 --> 28:35.970]  a lot of comment leavers. They were all wonderful and fantastic people. So my angle was, I went out,
[28:36.090 --> 28:41.350]  I walked around Seattle and I found this store that sold pre-wrapped gifts. And I thought,
[28:41.430 --> 28:45.970]  oh, that's cool. For like eight bucks, I can buy a gift and it's pre-wrapped. I have no idea what's
[28:45.970 --> 28:51.290]  in it. It's a surprise. So I landed on the idea because it was the week that the episode, I think
[28:51.290 --> 28:59.950]  97 or 96 came out where we declared, kind of declared war on Lucas, Hayden and Edward as like
[28:59.950 --> 29:04.510]  the name of the people we've never liked who were named those names. And I was feeling kind of bad
[29:04.510 --> 29:08.130]  about that. So what I did was I went out and I addressed the audience and I told a little about
[29:08.130 --> 29:15.230]  f*** face. And then I said, is there a Lucas or a Hayden or an Edward in the audience? And one person
[29:15.230 --> 29:18.770]  raised their hand and I was like, come on up to the stage. And they came up and I presented them
[29:18.770 --> 29:24.230]  the gift as an apology on behalf of f*** face and as a peace offering. And I said, here's your gift.
[29:24.330 --> 29:29.690]  We would just like to say, Edward, we're very sorry. We didn't mean to bemoan all Edwards on
[29:29.690 --> 29:34.390]  earth. He should be his ID. He really was Edward. He really was. So we're like, so please accept
[29:34.390 --> 29:40.190]  this as a peace offering. And if you could then relay that to all other Edwards on earth, we would
[29:40.190 --> 29:44.010]  appreciate that as well. Let them know, you know, put the pitchforks away. We're on good terms now.
[29:44.010 --> 29:49.350]  And we did that in every city and every time. It was f***ing hilarious. And every time it was
[29:49.350 --> 29:54.770]  awesome. And the first city in Seattle, I think it was an Edward. We had an Edward and a Lucas.
[29:54.910 --> 29:59.290]  I don't think we ever had a Hayden. Two Edwards and a Lucas. And Haydens were f***ing hiding like
[29:59.290 --> 30:04.930]  the cowards they are. And the Edward who came up, he had a Russian f*** shirt on. Like, so it was
[30:04.930 --> 30:11.190]  perfect. Oh, yeah. That's great. Yeah. And we also did mini breaks. I also found a baseball card shop
[30:11.190 --> 30:16.530]  that had 80, like 88, 89 and 90 tops cards. So I bought a bunch of packs and we tried to get
[30:16.530 --> 30:20.550]  Zimmers on stage, but we didn't. I think a live Zimmer would have been phenomenal. But a live
[30:20.550 --> 30:25.770]  Zimmer wouldn't happen. We tried. It didn't happen. But we did get to apologize to all Hayden's,
[30:25.830 --> 30:31.490]  Lucas's and Edward in at least in those three cities. And they all seemed incredibly gracious
[30:31.490 --> 30:35.090]  and grateful. I gave one of them. I gave one of them a koozie because, you know, I'm always pushing
[30:35.090 --> 30:39.590]  that koozie love. So I bought like a Seattle koozie and I gave one of those away. We went to the
[30:39.590 --> 30:43.310]  Biscoff store. And so I gave away a bunch of Biscoffs. I can't fucking stand those things,
[30:43.350 --> 30:47.870]  but people like them. I think it was San Francisco. You gave someone a giant Biscoff
[30:47.870 --> 30:52.610]  and some left handed scissors. And then at the next show, it was like a smaller Biscoff.
[30:54.210 --> 30:58.750]  I had one left. Yeah. There was a left handed store in San Francisco and I was like, I'm left
[30:58.750 --> 31:02.650]  handed. So I went and I just bought a bunch of left handed shit. And then I get and that's kind
[31:02.650 --> 31:05.590]  of a backhanded compliment, because I was like, if you're left handed, this means a lot to you.
[31:05.590 --> 31:14.170]  If you're not, then endure the hell of my life. Anyway, that was awesome. Is there anything
[31:14.890 --> 31:21.130]  that they don't make left handed that should? Oh, I don't know. I feel like most things you pick up
[31:21.850 --> 31:27.150]  like a spatula. It's not angled any specific way, typically. I got to say, though, dude,
[31:27.190 --> 31:31.590]  I agree with you, but they had left handed pins at that store. I didn't buy one, but I picked
[31:31.590 --> 31:34.650]  one up and I went, let's just fucking stupid. All pins are left. And then I went, oh, no,
[31:34.650 --> 31:39.150]  this is different. And it felt good. I should have bought it. It was like form to fit around
[31:39.150 --> 31:43.090]  my left hand. I admit it was I don't know how else to describe it other than say it was the
[31:43.090 --> 31:47.070]  best feeling I've ever felt holding a pin. I didn't buy it for some reason. I'm stupid.
[31:48.070 --> 31:51.850]  I was just thinking about the bit. But yeah, I guess you can make a left handed anything.
[31:52.330 --> 31:56.090]  Huh? That's all I just wanted to mention that we have a left handed Gerpler.
[31:56.090 --> 32:02.450]  I was about to say on behalf of Face, we've we have apologized officially to those three names.

[36:48.160 --> 36:51.880]  Should we talk about our Gerpler innovations that we've come up with, Geoff?
[36:53.020 --> 36:57.720]  Yeah, that was a big part of the tour for me too, was talking to you. Please take it away.
[36:57.720 --> 37:01.820]  Oh, has there been developments on the Gerpler? Oh, there have been some Gerpler developments.
[37:02.040 --> 37:07.140]  So this is, I don't know the extent of which we'll be able to produce these, but
[37:07.140 --> 37:12.600]  Geoff wanted a larger Gerpler. If you're going to have a Gerpler, there should be a Gerpler Max.
[37:12.960 --> 37:17.760]  There should be a Gerpler Max. And so I was trying to think of like, what would be
[37:17.760 --> 37:21.900]  the like the most maximum Gerpler? What would be the greatest thing that we could,
[37:22.000 --> 37:27.580]  we could put water into or whatever and sell as a drinking thing? And the best I came up
[37:27.580 --> 37:32.980]  with was, you know, those like roadside barriers that are like filled with, you see them in movies,
[37:33.060 --> 37:37.420]  like people crash into them. Yeah. So people don't stop down on a barrier. They crash. It's
[37:37.420 --> 37:43.420]  like that scene in speed. Yeah. So I was like, that should be what the Gerpler Max is. I don't
[37:43.420 --> 37:48.600]  know where we get those. I don't know how much they cost, but we should sell those. And then
[37:48.600 --> 37:56.280]  it somehow pivoted into this other idea of Jack has been a minor league fan for a long time now.
[37:56.280 --> 38:02.040]  And I'm sure he'd love a super fan status back that the only way in the redemption year,
[38:02.560 --> 38:07.280]  in the redemption year to give Jack his super, super fan status back would be because he's been
[38:07.280 --> 38:14.280]  running a lot of marathons and half marathons. If we attach some straps to one of those and put
[38:14.280 --> 38:19.460]  a hose in. So, you know, like those camelback things of water, like those small, very portable
[38:19.460 --> 38:23.260]  water packs that like joggers will drink out of while they're running. So they don't have to stop.
[38:23.260 --> 38:30.020]  If we essentially turn one of those barriers into one of those, and if he can run a whole race with
[38:30.020 --> 38:37.960]  it starting full, then he gets super fan status back. We talked about that. It only has to be a
[38:37.960 --> 38:44.240]  5k and he just has to complete it. And it gets easier the faster he drinks. Absolutely. I just
[38:44.240 --> 38:51.540]  want to see the reaction of people around him. Like all these people like camelbacks and you
[38:51.540 --> 38:58.200]  giant fucking just monster of a container. And he has to hold, he can't like put it on a wheel.
[38:58.720 --> 39:02.560]  No, he has to wear it like a camelback. It can't be a wheelbarrow. No.
[39:06.280 --> 39:10.100]  Because you may have invented the girth of bags, but it sounds like you also invented a wheelbarrow.
[39:11.880 --> 39:15.360]  I love how much stuff that we want to sell, like, and the stuff we've done,
[39:15.760 --> 39:20.180]  like the port-a-potty and stuff that can easily be taken from like a construction site.
[39:21.760 --> 39:24.040]  Uniform has some real industrial vibes.
[39:25.900 --> 39:30.360]  Uniform likes to go to apartment complex construction sites and just say,
[39:30.420 --> 39:37.000]  what do you got laying around? We'll take it. We can drink out of that. So then we decided
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.380]  if you're going to have a Gerpler Max, you've got to have a smaller version of the Gerpler.
[39:41.920 --> 39:49.760]  So Andrew came up with, I thought was brilliant. The Lil Gerp. L-A-L Gerp. And it's a baby Gerpler.
[39:49.760 --> 39:54.940]  And Andrew, what, how, how does that look to you? It's a thimble. We're selling a thimble.
[39:58.540 --> 40:04.420]  Your Lil Gerp is a thimble, or you can get a construction-sized barrel as the Gerpler Max,
[40:04.560 --> 40:09.720]  and then we just have your basic kitchen Gerpler. Maybe you could use the thimble to, to cant your,
[40:09.840 --> 40:17.640]  uh, Bovril thick Bovril paste before you dilute it. Dude, if we can get Jack drinking Bovril out
[40:17.640 --> 40:23.680]  of a big Gerpler Max, that'd be awesome. So Eric, we'll need you to, we'll need you to get
[40:23.680 --> 40:30.580]  with Ecom and get, get into production on those, please. Yeah. Uh, yeah, I think it, I, Gerpler
[40:30.580 --> 40:38.620]  full of Bovril is like making my stomach turn. Just imagine Jack tripping on the finish line,
[40:38.780 --> 40:43.580]  spilling Bovril all down the race. And then he's like, jump over this if you're vegetarian.
[40:45.660 --> 40:51.880]  I'm just imagining him tripping, knocking it over and just the odor and just like everybody
[40:51.880 --> 40:58.460]  puking around. Nah, Bovril smells good. Does it? Okay. In my head, every aspect of it is disgusting.
[40:58.960 --> 41:03.300]  Probably smells like, like beef, like what do they call it? Beef marrow, like, uh,
[41:04.100 --> 41:08.780]  bone marrow, like bone marrow, like beef bone marrow. Yeah. Kind of like what you cook with.
[41:08.780 --> 41:15.680]  Yeah. Like, uh, I would assume like, like beef stock, probably. Oxo cubes. Yeah, exactly like
[41:15.680 --> 41:21.360]  that. Hey, I also, uh, can I, can I show you guys something that I'm very excited about that?
[41:21.680 --> 41:28.980]  So I mentioned to you guys a while ago when I was, uh, I did, I, I got Ecom to buy me the, the,
[41:28.980 --> 41:34.640]  the industrial, uh, gold foil stamping machine. And so that we could hand, so that we could number
[41:35.500 --> 41:40.860]  cards to make it official for like break shows and stuff. And then I, I got the idea to, uh,
[41:40.940 --> 41:47.060]  to get a custom stamp made. Well, that stamp came in and I did a test and I wanted to show
[41:47.060 --> 41:51.440]  you guys the test. I'm excited. I'm very excited about it. I think it looks amazing. That looks
[41:51.440 --> 41:57.820]  so good. That looks incredible. That's not shit. It's not shit. That's the medium. There's a large
[41:57.820 --> 42:02.060]  that's about the size of the card and a small that's much smaller. I just did the medium one
[42:02.060 --> 42:08.460]  as a test. Isn't that fucking good though? Doesn't it look professional as dicks? Oh my God.
[42:09.180 --> 42:15.840]  It looks too good for us. Like it's amazing. It's Eric's right. He says the gold is stellar.
[42:15.980 --> 42:19.760]  Obviously we'll put it on the, on the Instagram, but I think it looks, if you can't see it,
[42:19.980 --> 42:24.920]  uh, it's an Ian looking up, you know, standard Ian. Uh, and it's, I don't know, half the size
[42:24.920 --> 42:31.100]  of the card. It's the outline, uh, and it is in gold. It's embossed in gold into the card. It's
[42:31.900 --> 42:36.060]  beautiful. I would love you to also get one made of your first attempt to Ian.
[42:37.660 --> 42:39.280]  I don't even remember that. Do we have that?
[42:42.500 --> 42:48.320]  Just floating above the triangle nose. Yeah. I'm going to throw this in there too. Just because
[42:48.320 --> 42:52.140]  when I was pulling this card out to, to stamp it today, I noticed this card and I thought it
[42:52.140 --> 42:55.460]  was the funniest baseball card I have ever seen. And it's not for anything other than,
[42:55.500 --> 42:58.120]  I just want to make you guys laugh. So here's, here's the card I saw today.
[42:59.040 --> 43:06.260]  Archie Bradley. Archie Bradley is doing. That's a high leg. That is an incredibly high leg.
[43:06.920 --> 43:12.000]  Yeah. But he's also like turned to the side. So he looks like he's doing like some sort of
[43:12.000 --> 43:17.080]  vaudevillian dance number at the same time. Pretty impressive. He looks like a rag doll.
[43:17.500 --> 43:22.760]  That's like a halo rag doll after a grenade went off. Eric says he's doing a street fighter kick.
[43:22.760 --> 43:32.340]  Yeah. Are you aware that we totally messed up the baseballs? What do you mean? Me being Geoff?
[43:32.740 --> 43:38.280]  Just us as a group. We blew it. Oh, how? And what, why? Well, listen to this.
[43:38.480 --> 43:44.740]  I would guess I probably hit 50 home runs. And we decided that we would box up a ball if he
[43:44.740 --> 43:50.520]  swinged or swung and missed, but not if he didn't swing. So he either hit it or he swung and missed.
[43:50.520 --> 43:54.140]  And that's what we're selling. So we're only selling the ones he missed? Yeah. Like if he
[43:54.140 --> 43:59.280]  didn't go for the swing, we just put it back into the rotation to pitch again. Hang on. Hang on.
[43:59.820 --> 44:07.400]  Hang on. The wording of that is weird. If, if Geoff swung the bat at the ball, that ball is being
[44:07.400 --> 44:13.500]  sold, whether it was connected wave or not. Yeah, that's it. That's incorrect. We, I hit every ball
[44:13.500 --> 44:18.460]  eventually. The ones that we swung and missed, we, we went, we, we, I hit again.
[44:19.380 --> 44:24.260]  So Eric and I explained what we did and then Geoff explained it in a completely different way.
[44:25.620 --> 44:30.660]  Is that what you think happened, Geoff? What do you mean? Well, we had the whole discussion
[44:30.660 --> 44:34.940]  months before where it was like, you know, it'll be a blind box to you. You won't know if you get
[44:34.940 --> 44:40.100]  one that's been hit or if it was a miss, but then you said that we... Yeah, but what we ended up doing
[44:40.500 --> 44:44.080]  was, because it was going so well, is any ball that I missed, we just threw it through the
[44:44.080 --> 44:47.420]  pitching machine again and I hit it. So I ended up actually connecting with every ball we sold.
[44:47.780 --> 44:55.820]  Yeah, except we didn't do that. Didn't we? No. No. If you swung at it, we pulled it off to the
[44:55.820 --> 45:01.280]  side. The only ones I was throwing back were the ones that you didn't swing at. Oh, okay. I missed
[45:01.280 --> 45:07.060]  that. But you were helping me point out. You were like, I swung at that one. Yeah. Okay. That's
[45:07.060 --> 45:10.060]  right. I guess I got that wrong in the moment then. I was just hitting balls all day long.
[45:10.560 --> 45:14.000]  Well, I mean, we can still do it your way, but we just have to go out and then re-hit
[45:14.500 --> 45:22.080]  basically the entire compilation I made of you missing. Uh, not hit. So we could go out and do
[45:22.080 --> 45:26.780]  them all. Well, the compilation of me missing was, well, some of those were foul tips. I only
[45:26.780 --> 45:32.800]  missed maybe 40 balls out of the 250. You, you did not miss a lot. A lot of like what, what you
[45:32.800 --> 45:39.900]  guys saw in the video of the misses were all of the misses. But again, we like, there are so many
[45:39.900 --> 45:45.780]  more balls in the other video that you'll see that are just absolutely crushed. And when I went out
[45:45.780 --> 45:53.620]  and played baseball this last week, we found even more in the woods. Yeah. He hit way more than he
[45:53.620 --> 45:58.180]  missed. We just thought when we originally talked about it, it'd be funny if, you know, in a face
[45:58.180 --> 46:02.500]  way, you might be buying just a piece of shit that was completely whiffed, but at least, you know,
[46:02.500 --> 46:08.420]  you knew he swung at it. That makes sense because I got one in the mail, uh, that does not have any
[46:08.420 --> 46:11.960]  kind of connection on. And I went like, that's weird. I was pretty sure I hit all those. I got
[46:11.960 --> 46:18.320]  one in the mail, but I have probably 20 in my garage. So it's really, that was a real, I just
[46:18.320 --> 46:22.600]  kind of threw mine back in there and went, uh, this should probably go to someone else. Uh, I
[46:22.600 --> 46:28.420]  thought that what you were going to say about messing up the baseballs is that, um, it, it's
[46:28.420 --> 46:35.940]  not really a stamp and Geoff just sort of filled his name with paint and then no actual, like,
[46:36.140 --> 46:40.860]  autograph was on the ball. Well, we talked about that last week. Right. Yeah. So, oh, speaking of
[46:40.860 --> 46:45.080]  which we have about a hundred balls left that we need to figure out what to do with. And somebody
[46:45.080 --> 46:50.420]  on the Instagram reached out to us who is like a professional paint maker. And he said, if we can
[46:50.420 --> 46:57.440]  give them what the, the color Gerpel is, he will mix up, uh, a couple of gallons of Gerpel paint
[46:57.440 --> 47:02.160]  and send it to us. And then we can hit the ball, the remaining hundred balls with Gerpel. That's
[47:02.160 --> 47:07.080]  amazing. So I think that's, that's an interesting idea. I think that's a great idea. So that's
[47:07.080 --> 47:10.560]  really great. Are you okay with what we did then? Or do you want to go out and re-hit the ones that
[47:10.560 --> 47:14.480]  you swung and missed at? Well, I only missed a few. I only missed like 30 or 40, so I'm fine with
[47:14.480 --> 47:19.220]  it. I think it's funny if they're not re-hit. I think just a small percentage of people just
[47:19.220 --> 47:23.060]  getting a ball that has, I think it creates more excitement when you, when you're buying something
[47:23.060 --> 47:27.660]  blind and then you, yeah, I totally either get screwed or you get a great little thing. Some of
[47:27.660 --> 47:31.800]  them actually got painted even though you missed because you swung paint on the, onto them. I was
[47:31.800 --> 47:38.600]  so like dialed in and hot and exhausted and focused that I, I was just hitting what was in
[47:38.600 --> 47:44.020]  front of me. So I probably got confused at some point out of, out of 250, I must have hit 210
[47:44.020 --> 47:50.080]  probably. Oh, easily, easily. Most of them are hit. Yeah. I like the idea too, of anyone who gets a
[47:50.080 --> 47:56.140]  miss ball, they can see, like theoretically they could see the ball that was missed. Yeah. Like it's
[47:56.140 --> 48:01.620]  an easy, like they have the footage of like, they can see their ball in play. They definitively know
[48:01.620 --> 48:06.300]  it's one of these balls. Yeah. If you get a clean ball, you were, yeah, that's a, that's an excellent
[48:06.300 --> 48:11.000]  point, Andrew. When we go out and do this again, because we're going to have to hit more balls,
[48:11.120 --> 48:16.200]  we have to find a different field. You hit, Geoff, I don't know how else to say it, you hit them too far.
[48:17.280 --> 48:22.700]  We have to go, we have to go to a bigger field where we can actually go out and like shag the
[48:22.700 --> 48:27.460]  balls instead of having to like find them in the woods later. We have to find a bigger field. Or
[48:27.460 --> 48:33.940]  just one with a big net at the back. Yeah. Or I guess one with a big net at the back. Or like a
[48:33.940 --> 48:38.660]  high fence, like some of them have much higher fences. Right. Yeah. I only have, I only have two
[48:38.660 --> 48:45.040]  modes, hit Gavin's camera or hit home run. I don't know how to, that's the only, the only two ways I
[48:45.040 --> 48:49.660]  know how to hit. So yeah, we'll have to get a different, a different field, I guess. Eric and
[48:49.660 --> 49:01.560]  Andrew did a, did a little thing on the YouTube this week. We did. Yeah. Yeah. Geoff didn't love
[49:01.560 --> 49:08.340]  it. No, Geoff was not a fan. That's fair. Now, I was not a fan. I like a prank that gets resolved
[49:08.340 --> 49:15.680]  in the moment. Like you'd show me the video and we laugh about it. And then I get my redemption
[49:16.400 --> 49:21.480]  four minutes later when we show the other video, just releasing of a two without explanation,
[49:21.740 --> 49:27.720]  a two minute video of me striking out with no explanation at four days without me being able
[49:27.720 --> 49:33.320]  to engage and explain what's going on. It was frustrating, especially considering that video
[49:33.320 --> 49:39.020]  has like 30,000 views and the YouTube video above it where I do hit the balls has like 7,000 views
[49:39.020 --> 49:44.400]  and all of the comments from people I got for two days that were like, I fucking knew you sucked.
[49:44.560 --> 49:48.420]  I told my wife you'd suck. She was right. She's fucking embarrassed for you. And I'm like,
[49:48.460 --> 49:53.920]  Jesus Christ. We have the other video going up tomorrow where you look like a true hero.
[49:55.500 --> 50:01.820]  So let's, let's go through this series of events because it is facing on several levels. We all
[50:01.820 --> 50:08.260]  are apparently the worst communicators that have ever existed. I don't disagree. I originally had
[50:08.260 --> 50:15.460]  the idea of like, oh, it'd be funny if we put the misses out a day before it ended up coming out
[50:15.460 --> 50:19.800]  with people who are sponsors on risk. You could listen to the episode. Uh, so there was, there's
[50:19.800 --> 50:24.120]  a portion that could see all of it, but I thought it'd be funny if there was like one day where the
[50:24.120 --> 50:28.640]  majority of people would only have that as a point of context, then they would listen to the episode
[50:28.640 --> 50:33.960]  the next day and the video would be out the next day to see all the hits. So they'd be wrong. Like
[50:33.960 --> 50:38.560]  I, in the brief moment I had, where I thought Geoff just missed a lot. I then realized that Geoff hit
[50:38.560 --> 50:45.040]  essentially nothing but dingers, hit them too far as Eric was saying. So I suggested this idea to
[50:45.040 --> 50:51.280]  Eric. And then Eric said that he talked to you about it, Gavin, to get approval for it. But I
[50:51.280 --> 50:55.360]  guess it wasn't clear it was going on the YouTube. Like there was a miscommunication there.
[50:55.760 --> 51:01.140]  I mean, like Geoff's saying, I, I'm only capable. I like doing it how Geoff likes it. I can't let
[51:01.140 --> 51:05.280]  people stew for days on a prank. I have to have the instant reveal. Otherwise I just get
[51:05.280 --> 51:10.300]  uncomfortable. Like I'm just put total. So I met, I made those videos just to be,
[51:10.760 --> 51:14.300]  well, either just to show you or just to put in the actual episode. And then for YouTube,
[51:14.300 --> 51:19.240]  I was going to cut like a whole, you know, a 10, 15 minute video of the whole day.
[51:19.440 --> 51:23.920]  So I didn't know that existed. Like I knew you talked about it, but I didn't know that that
[51:23.920 --> 51:29.660]  video existed. And I wouldn't have even suggested what I suggested. If I knew that video existed,
[51:29.920 --> 51:35.660]  I thought we only had those two videos. So I made that suggestion to Eric, not knowing that
[51:35.660 --> 51:40.200]  video existed. Then Eric talked to you about it. Cause Eric's like, yeah, talk to Gavin. He's cool
[51:40.200 --> 51:44.140]  with it. Like we're going to, we're going to do it. So then I guess it wasn't clear in your
[51:44.140 --> 51:48.920]  communication that it was going on the YouTube. No, he didn't mention YouTube. I assumed it was
[51:48.920 --> 51:53.040]  like, cause they're so sure it'd be on Instagram and the way Eric was talking, it was like, Hey,
[51:53.040 --> 51:56.600]  we're just going to put up the misses. I was like, okay, cool. You know, I guess until you get a
[51:56.600 --> 52:00.040]  reaction of Geoff and then you put up the other one, maybe that's what it sounded like. Well,
[52:00.360 --> 52:06.820]  to be fair to, I normally would have been, I was a big old baby about it. Uh, I'll be honest,
[52:07.240 --> 52:15.480]  but I, it just happens to release on a legendarily bad day for me. Like it was one of those days
[52:15.480 --> 52:20.000]  where like, you know, I would come in and I would be exhausted. And I would talk about how like
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.700]  arrow shit the crate at four in the morning and it was raining and I was getting duty on Emily's
[52:24.700 --> 52:28.960]  brand new dress and all that stuff. It was like that, like that level of shit happened like eight
[52:28.960 --> 52:34.920]  times to me that day before I opened up social media and got attacked. And I was like, what the
[52:34.920 --> 52:40.880]  fuck is going on? So I was just in a bad headspace that day. And I was, so I wasn't, I wasn't feeling
[52:40.880 --> 52:46.840]  the joke in the moment. So I had to take a break for a little bit cause I didn't want to be mean
[52:46.840 --> 52:53.560]  to you guys. I would say that was condiments mini. Yes. Yeah. But I, I shut it down before
[52:53.560 --> 53:03.360]  I turned into condiments max. Cause I couldn't, I wasn't sure initially if you were actually
[53:03.360 --> 53:08.240]  upset. Cause I, I, one, I suggested to Eric, I was like, well, this is like obviously a dick move.
[53:08.260 --> 53:12.520]  And if Geoff wants to do, he could like yell at us on the show about it. I wasn't sure the legitimacy
[53:12.520 --> 53:16.180]  of how annoyed you were. And then it became clear, Oh, this is actually something that really annoyed
[53:16.180 --> 53:21.860]  you. I felt bad, which then extended to me texting Gavin. I think I, this has been condiment.
[53:22.540 --> 53:29.080]  We cannot, we could maybe add a new word to our list of condimented a thing where it is extended
[53:29.080 --> 53:34.900]  into what was a joke into something more real. But between that event and the, uh, previously
[53:34.900 --> 53:40.540]  on base, I said Geoff yesterday, I was like, man, while we were on tour, this podcast really got away
[53:40.540 --> 53:48.660]  from us. We've got to figure out what's going on previously on working as yo, you still have your
[53:48.660 --> 53:54.040]  questions for the previously on shit. So we can do that before we close that out, just to put a
[53:54.040 --> 53:58.800]  loop, just to like really summarize how fucking bad we are communicating. I communicated to Eric,
[53:58.880 --> 54:03.620]  not knowing that you had a full video, Gavin, I just was not aware of that fact. Eric communicated
[54:03.620 --> 54:06.960]  to you what we're going to do with it, but you still didn't understand how it was going to be
[54:06.960 --> 54:12.640]  used. I then asked Eric for the video so we can maybe do something on social with it. He told me
[54:12.640 --> 54:17.220]  to talk to Nick about it. I talked to Nick about it. Never, that never happened. I never got the
[54:17.220 --> 54:21.200]  video. It just didn't come through. Download it from YouTube. It's up there right now, dickhead.
[54:21.620 --> 54:27.940]  This entire thing, this entire team is a complete mess. I was in the airport flying home from the
[54:27.940 --> 54:32.600]  tour and I was talking to Nick. I just proofed the last one. And we were talking about like,
[54:32.600 --> 54:38.400]  do we leave those hits and misses videos in the episode for the audio one? Because Nick
[54:38.400 --> 54:41.820]  had originally just trimmed it down. And I thought, well, maybe we can leave it in and
[54:41.820 --> 54:47.060]  just play the audio from it. Because I don't want the audio version to be like a shit watered down
[54:47.060 --> 54:51.420]  version of the video version. You kind of want them to be as equal as possible. And Nick and I
[54:51.420 --> 54:54.680]  will go back and forth, like talking seriously about it. Yeah. And then I was like, oh, maybe
[54:54.680 --> 55:00.180]  we should put it to the group. So we put it into the Facebook channel and it devolved into a
[55:00.180 --> 55:06.540]  conversation about cooking beans in a PC and we got absolutely no answers. I went back to Nick.
[55:06.640 --> 55:10.720]  I was like, well, uh, well, that serves us right for trying to put it to the rest of the group.
[55:10.900 --> 55:15.820]  It was just chaos. Everything's been chaos recently. And to be clear, those videos are
[55:15.820 --> 55:19.180]  still going to come out. Like you have the baseball video. We're still going to release
[55:19.180 --> 55:24.780]  your baseball cut. Oh, are we? Yeah, absolutely. No, we're not losing that. I want to see what
[55:24.780 --> 55:29.960]  that is. I absolutely, I don't want to sacrifice that. If that's done, we would be ridiculous to
[55:29.960 --> 55:35.280]  not release that. But you do realize that means that with it in the episode, the individual videos
[55:35.280 --> 55:40.880]  posted on the YouTube, plus my supercut of the entire day, they're going to be used three times
[55:40.880 --> 55:46.480]  in the same place. Yeah, that's fine. Then we're idiots. Yeah. Well, no, it's not. It's not ideal,
[55:46.480 --> 55:51.300]  but we're dumb. And I want to see, is there footage in the supercut that isn't in either of the other
[55:51.300 --> 55:57.260]  two cuts? Loads. That's most of the content. Yeah, then we're putting out the fucking content part.
[55:57.680 --> 56:03.460]  Yeah, I guess it's like the full video and then highlights and lowlights. What are we
[56:03.460 --> 56:08.420]  going to name the full one to differentiate it from the other shit that is out? Listen,
[56:08.920 --> 56:12.260]  we're going to have to figure that out. We're going to have to get better at this part of it
[56:12.260 --> 56:19.120]  because I only sense more video content in our future. This is, we're having this whole discussion.
[56:19.340 --> 56:23.340]  We haven't even broached the subject. There's a bean hole video that the audience has been
[56:23.340 --> 56:26.700]  waiting for that they think we haven't given them, but we haven't given it to them because we're at
[56:26.700 --> 56:30.600]  Gavin's editing it, trying to put it together. The thing is that I want to take my time and make
[56:30.600 --> 56:35.500]  decent videos, but I also want to whip up some quick shit each time to show you, like if I've
[56:35.500 --> 56:39.500]  done the thing that week, I want to have that update. So I quickly, that's why I quickly make
[56:39.500 --> 56:43.500]  the digging video or I quickly make the misses and hits video. That's for us to talk about in
[56:43.500 --> 56:48.200]  the episode. We should really upload the digging video as well. We should just make sure all these
[56:48.200 --> 56:52.820]  are available. I don't think it matters. But you also still want me to make bean hole full version
[56:52.820 --> 56:58.300]  as well. Absolutely. Yes. Right. Eric, I need an editor. Yeah. Gavin is,
[56:58.740 --> 57:03.760]  I'm going to cut. That's a tremendous amount of work for Gavin, who is a tremendous editor,
[57:04.020 --> 57:09.740]  but he's also a tremendously busy, successful guy who we got to get him some relief on that.
[57:09.860 --> 57:14.560]  I can't imagine. Like I was talking about, I felt so bad that after we ate the beans,
[57:14.660 --> 57:19.580]  I was like on that Sunday, I was like, well, I'm going to fucking go home and relax or I'm going
[57:19.580 --> 57:23.960]  to go relax now. Good day, everybody. And Gavin goes, I'm going to go home and watch 12 hours of
[57:23.960 --> 57:30.240]  bean and baseball footage. And I was like, oh yeah, his day's just started. It's fun, though.
[57:30.300 --> 57:35.700]  I like it. I enjoy it. I'm excited. I'm genuinely so excited with the video. We're terrible
[57:35.700 --> 57:40.020]  communicating. Those may or may not be available. I'm assuming they'll be available by the time they
[57:40.020 --> 57:47.040]  hear this. Who knows? You can check our Facebook or not Facebook. I don't know why my brain I'm
[57:47.040 --> 57:51.920]  going to be completely honest with you. What the mother fuck are you talking about?
[57:52.020 --> 57:58.180]  This is what happened, OK? I told the lactating story backwards from what I wanted to. I like
[57:58.180 --> 58:02.560]  shot the ball into the sand trap and I've been in the sand trap the whole show. I haven't been
[58:02.560 --> 58:07.400]  able to get out of the sand trap. It has been a tough time. I've taken several swings. I'm just
[58:07.400 --> 58:11.160]  going to trap the trap. Well, that's what the place is. We're digging a bean hole. So yeah.
[58:12.420 --> 58:16.440]  Oh, and you did reference. I think we do have a very clever idea to try to cook
[58:16.440 --> 58:22.780]  beans in a PC. We should try to sell that. Let's see if a PC gets the beans hotter than my bean
[58:22.780 --> 58:27.400]  hole. Never got an answer on how you wanted to handle the videos. But at least we got PC beans.
[58:29.440 --> 58:34.800]  Questions for the previously on. OK, I have my first question. Can I ask my question?
[58:35.120 --> 58:41.000]  Absolutely. Have I ever met this person in real life in my life? I'm going to say no.
[58:41.000 --> 58:48.620]  OK, that's my question. Is it one of the... is it the lawyer guy? Is it your first legal team
[58:48.620 --> 58:55.880]  or our legal team? No, no. Eric, you get a question. No, he knows. I already know the answer.
[58:56.300 --> 59:06.020]  Then ask a really good question. Nick. Nick's typing. Nick knows too. Eric, you blabbermouth.
[59:06.620 --> 59:09.700]  You leaked it to Nick? I don't remember. Did I tell Nick?
[59:11.180 --> 59:16.840]  You son of a bitch. I don't remember. I don't remember telling Nick. We're usually so good
[59:16.840 --> 59:21.420]  at communicating this stuff. I really don't remember telling Nick about who the previously
[59:21.420 --> 59:30.280]  on is. Who? Wait, when would I tell Nick? I don't know. I refuse to believe this was my fault. No,
[59:30.400 --> 59:39.180]  no, no, no. I could be wrong. How else? Hang on. Hang on. This guy never talks on the podcast
[59:39.180 --> 59:44.480]  and just unmuted to say I couldn't be wrong. He's going to have to record a pickup for himself.
[59:47.680 --> 59:50.640]  Okay. You're going to message me directly, Nick, who you think it is.
[59:52.460 --> 59:56.860]  Yeah, this is good. This will know. Yeah, yeah. Go ahead and slack, Andrew,
[59:56.980 --> 01:00:00.380]  who you think. Slack me right now who you think it is. Geoff and I could deafen.
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:07.320]  No, don't trust it. Oh, no. Well, see, Nick messaged me. I'll tell you what. I panicked
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:15.140]  and I said, yes, I was like, I got to record. What are you talking about? You didn't remember
[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:19.980]  where you heard it, but you don't know. No, I totally. I had a moment of like,
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:23.420]  oh, you know what? I know. So I don't have to turn on this mic and do all this stuff.
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:29.620]  The lie has gone too far. It's gone too far. He's in too deep. All right. Well,
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:33.040]  now you can give a guess. Yeah. Now you're going to ask your question. Go ahead. Oh,
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:37.880]  is it? Is that the person who wrote the variety article? Is it? Oh, my God. No,
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:41.740]  he wasn't. He said that for the last episode. Oh, he wasn't here for the last episode.
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:50.760]  Maybe there's a reason Nick doesn't talk on this one. You pulled up a pinch hitter and he just
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:56.740]  left. He just went home. I can't imagine being a fan of this podcast. The last 15 minutes have been
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:02.000]  insane. This is a good example of the communication thing.
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:08.360]  Dude, we're falling apart. We're 100 episodes in. We're worse than ever. We need to release
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:13.260]  a supplemental contact like Eric. Eric does his job. That's just face communicates.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:24.000]  Oh, yeah. Oh, man. Are you guys excited for next week? It's our it's our 100th episode.
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:27.900]  It's quite a milestone. Are we still in season four?
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:34.320]  Oh, yeah. No, season four goes for a while. We just started season four.
[01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:42.740]  OK, yeah. Is there a way we can on the website actually reflect the seasons accurately on our
[01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:49.980]  show page? So it makes no sense that I can I can try and see what I can do. Put the one episode
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:55.340]  like one and a half episodes or whatever that are. Yeah, I'll see what I can do.
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:02:00.740]  That'd be brilliant. Yeah. So so now, Andrew, you have stuff planned for episode 100. You have
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:06.120]  multiple things or just one thing. I have multiple things that I'm on the fence about doing. So I
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:11.460]  might have nothing. I either have a lot or nothing. That's fair. And Gavin, you have a story you want
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:15.760]  to tell. Is that all you have planned for 100? Yeah, I just I just remembered a story the other
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:19.580]  day. I realized I'd never told it. And I thought, oh, maybe I'll maybe if there's time on episode
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:25.000]  100, I'll tell that one. OK, I don't want to build it up too much. It's a story. So you what you're
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.820]  saying is this is the best story you will have ever told. You don't want to you don't want to
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:33.180]  build up too much. You'll tease it in the two episodes leading up. I don't want to tease it.
[01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:42.220]  You brought it up. Oh, my God. I can't wait for this story. I'll be telling maybe six out of ten
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:49.500]  stories. Hey, maybe you can land in the sand trap with me. I'll show you how not to get out of it.
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:54.960]  I couldn't tell you were rolling around the sand trap the whole episode. Oh,
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:03:00.280]  it was pretty obvious. He was flailing. Yeah, I was flustered. I picked up on it.
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:07.360]  Oh, I should say one little piece of housekeeping. A little kudos. I don't know if you guys saw it,
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:15.780]  but we had another little period of growth. The last two episodes have been boosted
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:19.960]  in views somehow. Do we do this in the episode now? We discussed the performance.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.400]  Yeah, I'm just saying like the last couple episodes did really well. So we must be on to
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:28.800]  you say that like it's a weird thing. Literally, essentially all I hear about the performance of
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:35.000]  the show is in the episode. That's the only time I get any update ever. Yeah, well, you may be used
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.980]  some of your pleasantries time. We there was a period. I don't know if we've ever talked about
[01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:42.640]  it, but there was a period where we became that we crossed a threshold and became the
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:48.280]  number one podcast in the company. And then straight back down again. And then we did
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.940]  that. We dipped for a little bit, but now we're now we're coming back up again.
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:58.320]  Interesting. Yeah, interesting. So whatever we did to dip, we shouldn't do again. And whatever
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:03.700]  we did to grow, we should only do that. What do we do to dip? I have no clue. I don't know.
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:08.180]  I don't know what we did to grow, to be honest with you. Hmm. Hmm. Whole thing was
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:13.360]  whole thing is perplexing to me. Hmm. I hope the audience likes beef paste.
[01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:19.020]  Well, this is how we're going to cement ourselves with the U.K. audience, right?
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:24.180]  Yes. Andrew, if I send you Bovril for the next episode, 100, will you drink it?
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:29.380]  I 100% will. Okay. I will do whatever you want me to do with it. I think we should make a
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:33.460]  hot Bovril and you should drink it. I think that's the purest form of my childhood. Can I use my
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:41.080]  Keurig to make it? Oh, maybe. Did I put it in one of my pods? I mean, it's a tool. Tools are
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:47.580]  meant to be used. I wonder if Bovril make like K-cups and Keurig things. Let me look. I feel
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:54.800]  extremely like that's not likely. With beef Keurig. Bovril K-cup. Oh, shit, dude. No.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:03.640]  Gearheads. What the fuck is that? Uh, no, it doesn't look like it. That's too bad. It does
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:10.540]  look fucking gross, though. Beefy Bovril. Oh, you can buy it on Amazon. Oh, fucking awesome. Ew.
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:17.820]  Why is it? Goddamn, dude. No offense, but some of the some of the graphic design in the UK is
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:24.120]  still in the 1980s. You guys have to modernize. Post it. Let me let me look. All right. Hold on.
[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:28.360]  I'll be image. Does that mean the Jack when he's doing the next time on he's going to have to
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:34.500]  work Bovril into different episodes? Like that does not look like something that was designed
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:39.320]  in the last 20 years. Well, it probably wasn't. What year was that? It looks good. Update your
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:44.240]  logo. Copy image. Let me do this one. This one's a little better. I like this one better, but it
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.940]  still looks old as fuck. It looks like something I would have bought. It looks like the canister
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:51.880]  I would have bought in 1984. I mean, I've never seen in that form. Yeah, I've seen that. I've seen
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:58.580]  it in like the tub. I've not seen it in the squeeze tube. Powder chicken ball. That's the chicken
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:09.180]  Bovril. Beefy Bovrite. Is that even? Is that the same brand? Bovrite? That's a competitor, I guess.
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:14.700]  What is? Where does Bovril? What is the name? Bovine Rill? What's the rill?
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:21.800]  I have no idea. I'm trying to process. Do you think they went in thinking it would be meat
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:26.100]  and vegetable extract or like they just started with meat extract? They're like,
[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:31.360]  we need to extract more extract. What else are we going to pull from? Vegetables.
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:41.120]  It is $42 to buy. It is $2.68 an ounce for Bovril on Amazon. Good Lord.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:45.200]  Andrew, if I ship you, do you need anything else? Because it's shipping like just one thing of
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.760]  Bovril to Canada. Is it going to be a waste? Do you need a phone? What do you need?
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:57.180]  No, I'm good. This is a Britbox thing. You go with a few other items if you want.
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:02.500]  Could we ever send Andrew an iPhone someday so that he can be blue in our text chains and that
[01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:06.980]  fucking images don't come through as postage stamps? We can just get on WhatsApp, I guess.
[01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:14.840]  I guess so. I don't mind because I don't deal with that at all. That's not an issue for me.
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:18.020]  Honestly, I don't know how it's still so bad. If you send us,
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:22.580]  if anyone on that chain sends a video, it's literally like 60 pixels wide.
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:27.900]  Yeah, it's unbelievable. That's great. It looks fine for me.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:38.180]  The only issue I have is for some reason when I text, I don't remember if it's either you,
[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:45.440]  Geoff, or Gavin, one of you pops out as a G, as a clickable G in my thing. And you look the same.
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:48.840]  Your symbol is the exact same for me. So if I'm texting you both simultaneously,
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:54.140]  it is very risky for me to not accidentally text. Why don't you just assign a picture to it?
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:57.840]  I probably should. That would solve that issue. But it's, I don't know, it's a little, it's kind
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:02.080]  of fun. There's that one time where I pitched an idea to Gavin thinking I was talking to Geoff.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:06.020]  Yeah, and then I asked you, and then you were like, sorry, I pitched it to the wrong guy. And
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:10.740]  I was like, well, you can pitch it to me now. And you're like, no. I'll let Gavin pitch you,
[01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:17.220]  I gave you the intro, Gavin can finish it. All right, we should probably wrap up. This was the
[01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:25.560]  99th time we've done this. And it just keeps getting dumber. So I'll finish that video.
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:32.260]  Yeah, tune in next week when we do it for the 100th time. It'll be 100 times the stupid
[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:39.360]  that you're used to. Special surprises in episode 100 by Andrew Panton, Gavin Free,
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:45.180]  who's going to tell a 6 out of 10 story. And I'm going to do a dumb bit at the beginning
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:56.400]  that hopefully you guys will enjoy. Yeah, so fucking tell people and then make them listen
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:00.940]  to it or watch it or however you consume this. And if they say, I'm not really into podcasts,
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:06.580]  grab them by the throat and tell them they are. Fucking knock it off with this. I'm not
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:10.920]  into podcast shit. Just get into podcasts. It's the future and the present.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:15.980]  And oh yeah, and like and like and subscribe. Thank you.
