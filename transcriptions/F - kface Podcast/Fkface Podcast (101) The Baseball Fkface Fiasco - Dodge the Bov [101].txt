[00:04.920 --> 00:06.720]  Previously, on F*** Face.
[00:16.730 --> 00:24.630]  Hello and welcome to the 101st episode of the F*** Face podcast. My name is Geoff Ramsey
[00:24.630 --> 00:30.750]  and with me, as always, Andrew Panton, way up there in Canada, and everybody's favorite
[00:30.750 --> 00:37.330]  British wanker, Gavin Free, from Oxfordshire via Austin, Texas.
[00:37.330 --> 00:41.150]  How are you doing, fellas? I'm good.
[00:43.330 --> 00:49.510]  Andrew was saying lactating women kinks. Yes. Not cakes.
[00:49.870 --> 00:54.130]  I thought he was saying cakes. Yeah, I mean, it was clear after the fact,
[00:54.230 --> 00:57.870]  but I also was just, I completely botched that. It was a mess. I don't know if we necessarily
[00:57.870 --> 01:02.130]  need to revisit the lactating kink. That was when you were in the bunker for half
[01:02.130 --> 01:04.150]  the episode. Yeah, like I just botched that immediately
[01:04.150 --> 01:05.950]  and I was in my own head for the rest of that episode.
[01:05.950 --> 01:10.490]  So I thought you said cakes and then I'm talking about like using tit milk to make a cake.
[01:10.570 --> 01:16.170]  And then, uh, you, you, then you said your mum was talking about sugar cookies. So I
[01:16.170 --> 01:20.030]  thought it was still on the same page. I don't know. I don't know what happened. I think
[01:20.030 --> 01:24.510]  a part of the problem is that we only hear each other over discord. So it sort of sounds
[01:24.510 --> 01:29.050]  like we're all playing among us at the time. But even in the, when I was proofing it, I
[01:29.050 --> 01:32.370]  didn't, I still didn't understand what you said. That's fair.
[01:33.090 --> 01:38.090]  I was trying to remember in the moment what I thought, because cakes make sense to me.
[01:38.330 --> 01:42.390]  I feel like maybe I also thought cakes. Yeah. It wasn't until the comment leavers
[01:42.390 --> 01:47.410]  were like, Gavin's an idiot. I was like, Oh, it still doesn't make a ton of sense.
[01:47.950 --> 01:52.610]  Yeah, that's fair. It was from my perspective, I started out and
[01:52.610 --> 01:56.550]  I immediately fucked it up in the order I wanted to do it. And I'm like, I just need
[01:56.550 --> 02:00.930]  anyone who wants to play ball with me right now. I'll take it. And you throwing, you going
[02:00.930 --> 02:04.590]  in the dessert category was like being thrown a life preserver. And I'm like, I'll just
[02:04.590 --> 02:08.290]  take whatever we can get. We'll go in this angle. We got to figure a way through this
[02:08.290 --> 02:18.890]  because I've fucked this. So, so what do you guys want to talk about today? I, uh, I got
[02:18.890 --> 02:24.490]  nothing. Speaking of fuck this, we could, we could transition immediately to fuck up
[02:24.490 --> 02:30.910]  that happened. We want to. Oh yeah. The fucking baseballs. All right. Let's get in to the
[02:30.910 --> 02:36.230]  fucking baseballs. I'd love to get Eric involved in this as well. What happened? I'll tell
[02:36.230 --> 02:40.950]  you. I'll tell you. I'll break it down. What happened? Rooster teeth is a mini headed monster.
[02:41.150 --> 02:47.050]  We are a company of hundreds and hundreds of people. And so, uh, one of the frustrating
[02:47.050 --> 02:53.290]  things about being an on-camera talent from time to time is that when a mistake is made
[02:53.290 --> 02:58.530]  behind the scenes or there's an issue behind the scenes, the talent wears it. So what happened
[02:58.530 --> 03:04.610]  was we released about 200 baseballs that we had hit or at least swung at, uh, you know,
[03:04.650 --> 03:08.410]  the whole saga, but now they're, they're all gone. Please stop looking for them. Don't go there. It
[03:08.410 --> 03:13.250]  is just a Haven for snakes. Uh, there we we've accounted for every baseball. There are zero
[03:13.250 --> 03:17.330]  more baseballs. We've, we've checked serial numbers. They're all accounted for a hundred
[03:17.330 --> 03:21.850]  percent of them have been recovered. Please do not look for more baseballs. Okay. So what happened
[03:21.850 --> 03:27.450]  was we wanted to allow people the opportunity to buy them. We knew that there'd be more people
[03:27.450 --> 03:32.230]  wanting to buy them than we had to sell. And so you try to be as precise as possible with that.
[03:32.290 --> 03:37.310]  So we said at 10 a.m. Central time on whatever day it was, we're going to release the balls.
[03:37.850 --> 03:41.790]  And then everybody who wants one can come in and it's kind of like a melee. I understand,
[03:41.890 --> 03:45.530]  but like people that want it can all like go there at the same time and, and, and, you know,
[03:45.730 --> 03:50.570]  try their luck recognizing that we don't have enough balls for everyone, unfortunately. Uh,
[03:50.570 --> 03:55.250]  but you know, I only got so there was only so much juice in my arms. There's a physical cost
[03:55.250 --> 03:59.050]  of this item. Like it makes complete sense that it would be a limited amount of them. A huge
[03:59.050 --> 04:06.910]  physical cost that cost me, uh, overall about, about, about three weeks of, of, of, of pain.
[04:07.430 --> 04:14.510]  Cost me a tripod. Cost Gavin a tripod. Yeah. So it cost him some financial pain. So, uh,
[04:14.750 --> 04:18.670]  so what happens is we're not the ones that actually take the balls and put them up on the store.
[04:18.930 --> 04:24.330]  They have to go to our shipping company and then they have to like onboard them and put them into
[04:24.330 --> 04:30.150]  the, uh, into the inventory system. And then they have to be individually wrapped and all that stuff.
[04:30.250 --> 04:35.390]  And while that's going on, they have to be added into our web store via a backend. And this is
[04:35.390 --> 04:39.250]  something I used to do for the first seven or about the first eight years of the company,
[04:39.350 --> 04:44.890]  I ran the store by myself. So I understand how, how difficult and how much more work
[04:44.890 --> 04:49.250]  it is behind the scenes than you may realize. It sounds like you just hit a button and you go,
[04:49.510 --> 04:53.970]  but it's really not that simple. There's a lot of linking and branching and a lot of eyes that got
[04:53.970 --> 04:58.730]  to be dotted and T's that got to be crossed. And so we asked them to be put up at 10 a.m.
[04:59.010 --> 05:03.650]  The person who ended up putting them in was not the person we told. Information gets passed down.
[05:03.850 --> 05:07.290]  It was a bit of a game of telephone from time to time, you know, a little purple monkey dishwasher
[05:07.290 --> 05:12.190]  in there. What essentially happened was the process. It's not an exact process. It takes
[05:12.190 --> 05:16.870]  anywhere between 10 and 15 minutes to add them to all the places that they need to be and then
[05:16.870 --> 05:22.510]  publish it to the store. Uh, and so that they go live. So the person that does it, they typically
[05:22.510 --> 05:27.430]  start about 9 45. Uh, and cause you know, that gives them a good 15 minutes to work with. And
[05:27.430 --> 05:31.910]  then they just get it as close to, to, in this instance to 10 a.m. as possible. What happened
[05:31.910 --> 05:38.350]  in this instance is it just, the process went faster than normal. And so not realizing, uh,
[05:38.350 --> 05:44.290]  that we had a hard time, that department, uh, they just published them early. Right. Which is
[05:44.290 --> 05:47.870]  like, if you think about it, if you're just a person who's like, whose job is to do that,
[05:47.870 --> 05:50.350]  you're like, well, I'd put them out five minutes early. Then people have, you know,
[05:50.350 --> 05:53.650]  then they're just, they're waiting for you when you show up. I don't think they understood the
[05:53.650 --> 05:59.870]  demand. And so by about 9 50, uh, all of the balls had been sold out. So the people who showed
[05:59.870 --> 06:04.650]  up early were rewarded by getting the balls because they showed up early and were like spam and
[06:04.650 --> 06:09.010]  refresh. So those people were, were, uh, those early birds, they caught those worms. They got
[06:09.010 --> 06:12.870]  those little ball worms. Uh, and then the people who dutifully showed up at 10 a.m. When we told
[06:12.870 --> 06:16.730]  them to, we're like, what do you mean they're sold out? What the fuck? And they didn't get it.
[06:16.730 --> 06:24.050]  They were understandably justifiably upset as were we, we were upset because people were upset. We
[06:24.050 --> 06:30.010]  wanted to give everybody a fair shot at getting the balls. And we felt like, uh, through no
[06:30.010 --> 06:35.450]  intentional fault of anybody's own, uh, that we didn't deliver on that. And so we were gutted
[06:35.450 --> 06:41.310]  and frustrated as I know the e-com department that, uh, runs this on the back end, they were
[06:41.310 --> 06:45.670]  also disappointed. Now my solution to this going forward, and I have talked about this a little
[06:45.670 --> 06:50.230]  bit with, uh, actually at length with Eric, you, by the way, you guys want to see a producer producing
[06:50.230 --> 06:57.010]  in action. Eric was on the ball that day. He was all over this all day long. Uh, shout out and, and
[06:57.010 --> 07:01.890]  major kudos to Eric for doing a hell of a job trying to get to the bottom of this and get it
[07:01.890 --> 07:05.270]  all worked out and get figured out what happened and how to make sure it doesn't happen again.
[07:05.350 --> 07:11.650]  My solution would be just to never announce an exact time again because, uh, we fucked it up twice
[07:11.650 --> 07:16.790]  and I don't want to do, I don't want to do that again. No, no, here's, here's the thing. Here's
[07:16.790 --> 07:21.230]  the thing. When things like this happen, I don't really care why these things happen. It's, it's
[07:21.230 --> 07:24.870]  upsetting, but what are you going to do? Belabor the point, you know what I mean? All I want to
[07:24.870 --> 07:32.230]  know is are we capable of doing the thing that we initially set out to do going forward? So I had
[07:32.230 --> 07:38.110]  a lot of conversations with a lot of people in the e-com team and I was assured that going forward,
[07:38.110 --> 07:46.530]  when we have these down-to-the-minute drops, we can do them. I found out what the limitations are,
[07:46.730 --> 07:51.490]  I found out what the problems or what the hiccups would be, but I was assured that when we go,
[07:51.610 --> 07:56.890]  going forward, if we wanted to do this stuff for down-to-the-minute stuff, what happened this time
[07:56.890 --> 08:03.090]  won't happen again and we can do it to a precise minute the way that we want it.
[08:03.090 --> 08:07.410]  To me, it sounds like e-com went in for pleasantries. They went in early.
[08:08.650 --> 08:14.010]  And you know I'm not a fan of that. I, and hey, listen, I think there's a lot of people that feel
[08:14.010 --> 08:21.550]  like your stance on pleasantries is 100% validated by this whole ordeal. I saw, I saw a lot of that
[08:21.550 --> 08:25.630]  sentiment. As a fan of pleasantries, let me, there's a line of pleasantries. You can have
[08:25.630 --> 08:30.410]  too much pleasantries. They were too early on the pleasantries. You can't, you can't be 20 minutes
[08:30.410 --> 08:36.170]  early on the pleasantries. A five minute pleasantry? That's a different story. So, uh, I know that
[08:36.170 --> 08:40.190]  there's a lot of audience members out there who are frustrated. We are also frustrated. Eric has
[08:40.190 --> 08:44.470]  put a lot of work into making sure that the next time we do this, it'll work without a hitch. And
[08:44.470 --> 08:49.230]  I'll tell you right now, if we fuck it up a third time, I'm, I'm just going to eliminate the
[08:49.230 --> 08:55.130]  opportunity for us to release to the minute. I'm just like, it'll be out sometime on this day.
[08:55.630 --> 08:59.850]  Best of luck. Check, you know, like, well, I'll give you like, we'll give you like a window,
[09:00.030 --> 09:05.430]  like more, like, it'll be like when you have to get your internet fixed and you call AT&T or,
[09:05.530 --> 09:10.590]  or Spectrum or whoever you have in it with. And they go, yeah, we'll be there between 8am and
[09:10.590 --> 09:15.230]  noon. That'll be the new window. We'll be like, we're going to drop the balls. Why, why would we
[09:15.230 --> 09:23.350]  want to operate in the worst way? Because we can't operate in the accurate way. The way to fix this
[09:23.350 --> 09:30.390]  going forward is for us to operate like Spectrum internet. That's not a great comparable, but to
[09:30.390 --> 09:34.410]  Geoff's defense, I went through a phase where I was super into trying to collect like Mondo posters,
[09:34.410 --> 09:40.110]  like a long time ago, many years ago, and they do not put specific times out there. Like it'll
[09:40.110 --> 09:43.990]  release in this day. At least they didn't back then, but they would always put them into the
[09:43.990 --> 09:48.070]  system at around 10am, but they were never definitive. So I think there's, there's room
[09:48.070 --> 09:51.830]  for that. There's a, there's a history of companies doing that. I'm just saying, if we
[09:51.830 --> 09:57.070]  blow it again, if we're, if we, if we strike out, if we're over three on this, I think that we got
[09:57.070 --> 10:01.730]  to reevaluate. I'm willing to give it another shot. If we get three strikes on our baseballs.
[10:01.890 --> 10:06.570]  Yeah, but I'm absolutely willing to give it another shot. I appreciate the work that Eric
[10:06.570 --> 10:10.870]  did. I trust the e-comm team can get it right. I'm just saying, if we don't, we got to cut our
[10:10.870 --> 10:15.970]  losses. Totally. If it happens again, I won't talk about it. You guys can talk about it on the show.
[10:15.970 --> 10:21.330]  I won't talk about it on the show because I won't have anything that we could air that like,
[10:21.450 --> 10:26.870]  nothing that I would say would be usable. So like, I'm guaranteeing that it will not happen again.
[10:27.230 --> 10:33.150]  All right, there we go. So to that end, we want to do a make good. We want to make it up to the
[10:33.150 --> 10:40.130]  audience members who followed the letter of the law and showed up at 959 to wait for the clock
[10:40.130 --> 10:44.490]  to tick over to 10 and try to buy the balls and find out they were not there. I've already asked
[10:44.490 --> 10:51.050]  to buy us more balls. I'm prepared to go out and do it all over again. Now, my initial idea,
[10:51.370 --> 10:56.070]  my initial idea, and there's a counter argument to that. And I'd love to. And I think I think the
[10:56.070 --> 11:00.210]  counter argument is probably ultimately correct. But I'd like to at least hit with my initial idea
[11:00.210 --> 11:04.410]  was to mix it up a little bit to make it a little different, to share some of the burden on me.
[11:04.970 --> 11:10.950]  Maybe I hit 100, maybe Gavin hits 50, maybe Eric does 20. And then maybe we mail a couple to Andrew
[11:10.950 --> 11:14.950]  and he can do whatever weird shit Andrew does with stuff. And then we just kind of mix it all
[11:14.950 --> 11:19.890]  up. And then you're getting like the potential of maybe you get a Gavin ball in blue, you get an
[11:19.890 --> 11:23.610]  Eric ball in orange or a Geoff ball in black. Yeah, different paints for different people.
[11:24.410 --> 11:29.030]  Andrew's counterpoint was we can't make a new product that's different because that's just
[11:29.030 --> 11:33.070]  going to make the want the people who already bought the black hit balls want the new product
[11:33.070 --> 11:38.170]  as well. We should there should be parity between the product so that everybody gets the same
[11:39.030 --> 11:43.710]  potential ball. And I think as much as it pains me to say it, I think he's probably right.
[11:43.810 --> 11:48.910]  Man, this is deep. I think it's also a conversation that the audience could respond to,
[11:49.110 --> 11:53.870]  like in the comments of this, like, would they rather just do the exact same thing as like a
[11:53.870 --> 11:58.730]  pure make good so people who already have one don't feel obligated to buy this one? Or do you
[11:58.730 --> 12:04.250]  want would you prefer what Geoff just said of like us all having our own takes on the balls and then
[12:04.250 --> 12:07.730]  like a second release essentially that way with a larger volume of them?
[12:08.030 --> 12:12.110]  We'll let the audience decide. We'll kind of go by audience sentiment after this airs.
[12:12.330 --> 12:19.730]  Either way, we're going to, in some fashion, either create an identical product or a newer
[12:19.730 --> 12:25.190]  altered product and release another, I guess, two or three hundred balls out into the wild.
[12:25.350 --> 12:31.570]  So if you didn't get one, you'll be able to try again just because we want to make it up to you
[12:31.570 --> 12:40.090]  because there was a lot of anger out there in the world. And I get it. I get it. I want to make it
[12:40.090 --> 12:42.930]  up to every comment leaver and every regulation listener out there.
[12:43.050 --> 12:46.830]  Like when you get beat out for something, like if it drops on time, that's just how it goes.
[12:47.090 --> 12:51.550]  Like it sucks, but it's like you live with that. But like when the system fails, like when you
[12:51.550 --> 12:55.850]  feel like a bunch of bots bought it or whatever, like something went against it, that sucks. Like
[12:55.850 --> 13:00.690]  that's that's like an understandable frustration. So yeah, it sounds like we've been able to figure
[13:00.690 --> 13:06.950]  stuff out, hopefully, and we will we will do make it on this and depending on what the audience wants.
[13:07.110 --> 13:12.050]  I think just to say sincerest apologies. Absolutely. If you showed up and felt slighted, we are going to
[13:12.050 --> 13:15.910]  do our absolute damnedest to make it up to you. It was very us, though. It was very f***ed face.
[13:16.030 --> 13:22.830]  It was. Very f***ed face. But, you know, yeah. Yeah. We don't have to be so true to the letter of the show
[13:22.830 --> 13:29.650]  all the time. Andrew, you you wanted to see you wanted to roll into something.
[13:29.690 --> 13:33.850]  So speaking, I have a little like story to tell those that's very funny that happened to me
[13:33.850 --> 13:41.970]  recently. Speaking of like show expenses, I filed my taxes last week and typically whenever I have
[13:41.970 --> 13:46.590]  done things for this show, because it's work, but it's weird. It's a weird category thing.
[13:46.890 --> 13:50.230]  I've never really tried to claim what would be traditional work expenses.
[13:50.790 --> 13:57.190]  And so this is the first year I attempted to do so, including the porta potty. So I was like,
[13:57.550 --> 14:02.650]  how do I how do I submit this in like a way that makes sense? That's not going to be like
[14:02.650 --> 14:08.050]  highly questioned. So I thought, oh, fancy up the wording. And I called it production equipment.
[14:08.410 --> 14:13.690]  I listed the porta potty as production equipment on my form. I put the price amount down. I put
[14:13.690 --> 14:19.290]  the bingo wheel down as production equipment. And I put some comic books down when we're doing
[14:19.290 --> 14:25.250]  research, extensive research. I put all of the BTS sauce orders as production meals. I was trying
[14:25.250 --> 14:32.170]  to class up everything as much as possible. You should be expensing all this to the company,
[14:32.350 --> 14:35.390]  not to the government. Yeah, I don't know how any of this works. You're an employee.
[14:35.710 --> 14:43.210]  Talk to the producer. So I put all that in and I brought it to the person that does my taxes
[14:43.210 --> 14:47.730]  and I showed them the form and I'm like, so I got these, I got this production stuff.
[14:47.730 --> 14:53.190]  And they immediately said, they pointed at the porta potty and said, what is this? I said,
[14:53.210 --> 14:56.610]  what do you mean? It's they're like, no, like I understand it says production equipment.
[14:56.950 --> 15:02.770]  What was the equipment? And I had to say porta potty and the look of shock on their,
[15:02.930 --> 15:08.910]  like they were like, they said, they audibly said, what? And they look so confused. And I had
[15:08.910 --> 15:14.870]  them then explain what it was that it was a porta potty and why it was related to the show and that
[15:14.870 --> 15:19.310]  made these mugs and it was this whole thing. And then I realized, oh no, she's going to do this
[15:19.310 --> 15:24.490]  with all of them. So then she immediately pointed to the next one. What is this production equipment?
[15:24.690 --> 15:30.070]  And I had to just go bingo wheel, didn't question that one. And then we're able to move on. But the
[15:30.070 --> 15:35.430]  embarrassment of having to tell somebody porta potty. And there's just the shocked look on her
[15:35.430 --> 15:42.870]  face was very funny. Oh my God. So I'm, I'm almost certainly going to get audited. I'm excited for
[15:42.870 --> 15:47.830]  this process. And you could have just got reimbursed. I could have just got potentially.
[15:48.030 --> 15:52.290]  Yeah. I don't know how any of that stuff works, as I said, but we have a form, I think. Do we?
[15:52.370 --> 15:57.030]  Yeah. It's expense reports. It's called Eric. Yeah. I'll introduce you to the wonderful world
[15:57.030 --> 16:04.990]  of concur expense sheet reporting. Yeah. So they made those audible noises and then you're welcome
[16:04.990 --> 16:10.750]  man. Enjoy. Yeah. Well, some of it to be fair, like I don't, the porta potty was a weird thing
[16:10.750 --> 16:14.370]  where it was just something I wanted to do and I'd felt like it would be tough to get approval
[16:14.370 --> 16:20.130]  of because it's expensive. It was over a thousand dollars. Uh, so I just did it. Yeah. It just feels.
[16:21.990 --> 16:26.530]  Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. It's a lot of money for you. I mean, I mean, just so you're aware,
[16:26.630 --> 16:30.170]  there's no way I would have gotten approval for over a thousand dollars for a porta potty.
[16:30.410 --> 16:34.090]  Exactly. Like, like, like there's like, it's just, it just wouldn't have happened. Like
[16:34.090 --> 16:40.430]  it sold out on mugs though. Like it was a valuable, it was worth it from the 100% worth it.
[16:41.030 --> 16:46.550]  We sold 1000 Tiki mugs because of that porta potty. You bought it, right? Right. And you guys
[16:46.550 --> 16:51.070]  understand the order that these things happened in, right? Okay. Just making sure. Okay. We didn't
[16:51.070 --> 16:57.310]  sell the Tiki mugs before we did the porta potty. No, but it all worked out in the end. It was a
[16:57.310 --> 17:00.890]  clear thing. It was a great idea. I think it's impossible to deny that it was a great idea.
[17:01.410 --> 17:05.630]  What, what you're doing though, what we're doing is we're building a resume of success
[17:05.630 --> 17:11.590]  so that now when we go to, uh, I dunno, the finance department and say, Hey, we need to buy,
[17:11.770 --> 17:17.930]  you know, this thousand dollar piece of nonsense, but we promise it'll turn into content down the
[17:17.930 --> 17:23.710]  road. Uh, they'll go, Oh yeah, well you've proven that time and time again. So, uh, sign off.
[17:28.550 --> 17:32.010]  When you use the bathroom, you always close the door behind you, right? You don't want
[17:32.010 --> 17:35.990]  random passerby looking in on you. So why would you let people look in on you when you go online?
[17:36.390 --> 17:40.210]  Using the internet without ExpressVPN is like going to the bathroom and not closing the door.
[17:40.890 --> 17:44.310]  Did you know that your internet service provider knows every single website you visit?
[17:44.710 --> 17:48.510]  And what's worse is they can sell this information to ad companies and tech giants who will use your
[17:48.510 --> 17:53.470]  data to target you. ExpressVPN puts a stop to this. It creates a secure encrypted tunnel
[17:53.470 --> 17:57.570]  between your device and the internet so that your online activity can't be seen by anyone.
[17:57.570 --> 18:02.870]  I use ExpressVPN on all my devices. It works on everything, phones, laptops, even routers.
[18:03.350 --> 18:07.650]  So everyone who shares your wifi can still be protected even if they don't have ExpressVPN.
[18:08.490 --> 18:13.430]  ExpressVPN is a great service. I personally use it to look at libraries for other, uh,
[18:13.430 --> 18:17.650]  streaming services that I can't access. It just, it adds so much content. It's awesome.
[18:18.090 --> 18:22.010]  And the best part is using ExpressVPN is as easy as closing the bathroom door.
[18:22.230 --> 18:27.150]  You just fire up the app, click one button, and you're protected. ExpressVPN is the world's
[18:27.150 --> 18:32.390]  number one rated VPN by Mashable, The Verge, and countless others. So if you're like me and

[20:11.050 --> 20:13.690]  because I should have done this at the beginning of the show, but I'm an idiot.
[20:14.250 --> 20:18.670]  Last episode, Geoff, you came at me pretty aggressively at the end. You took some shots
[20:18.670 --> 20:26.530]  my way. You just fucking... I felt I told a good story and you're like, oh, what about you?
[20:26.630 --> 20:32.710]  You got any fucking content for this episode? So I came up with a few games, Geoff, and one of them
[20:34.670 --> 20:41.170]  is sort of time sensitive. Are we going to start off the next 100 episodes with you being mad at
[20:41.170 --> 20:46.230]  me? No, we're just going to conclude within this one because I did a thing. I came with the games,
[20:46.390 --> 20:51.650]  Geoff. This is game one. This is an important thing I should have mentioned earlier for my idea with
[20:51.650 --> 20:56.330]  it. Before you go any further, can I ask you a question? Absolutely. Did you mail something to
[20:56.330 --> 21:02.850]  me? No. Okay. Just making sure because I had a FedEx note on my door and if it was for the show,
[21:02.910 --> 21:08.930]  I didn't get it. Okay. No. But speaking of mailing stuff, so this ties in, we got a Bovril taste
[21:08.930 --> 21:16.010]  test potentially happening today. By the way, I've had Bovril. That's exciting. We can talk about
[21:16.010 --> 21:23.830]  that. I made popsicles. I have six popsicles. I made a tray. Three of them are good things.
[21:24.510 --> 21:30.050]  No, they're all different things. There's one Bovpop in that mix. Now I didn't put these together
[21:30.050 --> 21:35.910]  so I don't know which one is what. There's six of them. I will have five of them. Three of them are
[21:35.910 --> 21:41.330]  bad. Geoff, you can pick which ones I eat whenever you want to. If you say a number, one through six,
[21:41.690 --> 21:47.450]  I will then pull that one out. Front left is the first one. So front left and to the right of it is
[21:47.450 --> 21:54.250]  two. I'll go up from there. There's six flavors. The three good ones, seven up because that was
[21:54.250 --> 22:01.370]  the first soda chug I did. I used seven up. The second good popsicle is Coca-Cola, my cold beverage
[22:01.370 --> 22:07.870]  of choice. Third delicious popsicle, apple juice. A big apple guy. Love apple juice. Oh, hell yeah.
[22:08.330 --> 22:13.350]  Is it Cosmic Crisp juice? It's not. I wish it was. It'd be even better. The bad three,
[22:13.930 --> 22:22.790]  salad cream is one of them. The next bad one is Bovril, as you know about. And one of them
[22:22.790 --> 22:29.830]  is pancake batter. I was told... Oh, Jesus. I was told that one of these did not freeze at all
[22:29.830 --> 22:34.750]  and I am not excited about that one. So this is going to be sort of a Bovril taste test, but
[22:34.750 --> 22:40.470]  possibly in a true salad cream like fashion, you might not pick the Bovril one. I might
[22:40.470 --> 22:45.950]  completely avoid the Bovril. So you're going to do five. Yeah, we're going to do five. One of these
[22:45.950 --> 22:50.190]  I will not eat. You can pick. You just say a number one through six at any point in the show
[22:50.190 --> 22:55.450]  and then I will pull out. Eric has a good point. You should do them blind. Yeah, well, I don't know what
[22:55.450 --> 23:00.530]  they are already. They're already blind to me. Don't even look. What I'm saying is that, say,
[23:00.570 --> 23:05.430]  Geoff says three. OK, you pull out three, but you don't look like close your eyes. Don't look at
[23:05.430 --> 23:11.170]  what three is. Pull it out directly into your mouth because I think like don't smell it. Just
[23:11.170 --> 23:16.370]  go. No, that's fair. That's fair. So this will be your first time having Bovril and it's a frozen
[23:16.370 --> 23:21.130]  Bovpop potentially. Yeah, potentially. I don't know if that's the one that didn't freeze. Did
[23:21.130 --> 23:25.150]  you go and find Bovril yourself or did my Bovril finally show up? Your Bovril never arrived. That's
[23:25.150 --> 23:30.030]  what I'm saying. As far as packages go, I don't know. We should really check on that. I'm assuming
[23:30.030 --> 23:35.330]  Amazon delivered. They might be lost. They couldn't find my door. They're missing. So I have
[23:35.330 --> 23:41.790]  to go and buy my own Bovril over the weekend. Oh, it was easy to find. I had to go to three grocery
[23:41.790 --> 23:46.070]  stores, so I wouldn't say it's the easiest to find, but I was able to get it. But it existed in
[23:46.070 --> 23:50.330]  your in your town. Oh, it totally exists in my town. Yeah, it wasn't like every store had it,
[23:50.330 --> 23:55.330]  but yeah, it exists here. I was looking on Amazon for Bovril. There was like one seller and it was
[23:55.330 --> 24:00.550]  like next day prime delivery. And on the thing, it said imported from Canada. So I thought, oh,
[24:00.570 --> 24:05.610]  if I just turn around and put a Canadian address, maybe it'll be quicker. But I guess they like
[24:05.610 --> 24:11.330]  pre-imported from Canada, sat in the US. So I guess to send it back to Canada has been a real
[24:11.330 --> 24:16.490]  problem because that stuff's still not been delivered. That's incredible. Yeah, they're lost.
[24:16.490 --> 24:23.170]  Yeah, it just says, oh, it says delivered today. Really? Yeah. Oh, fuck. Do I have more Bovril
[24:23.170 --> 24:32.230]  in my mailbox? Oh, no. I hope I like it. Oh, fuck. I can't believe, Geoff, you had,
[24:32.590 --> 24:38.070]  you tried Bovril outside of proper f*** face canon. Well, what else am I going to do? I was,
[24:38.190 --> 24:43.550]  well, listen, have it. I was, it was given to me during, I went to a, all right, so
[24:44.750 --> 24:49.510]  well, let's do this first before we get into me. Well, this is Andrew's thing. You could tell a
[24:49.510 --> 24:52.950]  story and then in the middle of the story, say four, and then I just have to f***ing pull it out.
[24:53.050 --> 24:58.430]  Okay, got it. So, so I went to England, I went to the UK for a week. I spent like eight days over
[24:58.430 --> 25:02.430]  in London, in your neck of the woods, Gav. By the way, London says hi, they miss you. Hello.
[25:02.650 --> 25:05.950]  Uh, that's not, that's not true at all. Nobody, everybody I talked to in England,
[25:06.050 --> 25:09.870]  they'd never heard of you. I'm like, uh, do you want any messages for Gavin? And they're like,
[25:09.870 --> 25:17.650]  what, who? Uh, first off, Bovril, you made it sound like Bovril's everywhere in the UK.
[25:18.350 --> 25:25.490]  It took me six days before I finally encountered Bovril. That's going to Sainsbury's, Waitrose,
[25:26.570 --> 25:30.890]  uh, Tesco, all the different grocery stores. Talking to people at stores being like, do you
[25:30.890 --> 25:34.490]  guys, you know where I could find Bovril? And everybody going, why would, why would you want
[25:34.490 --> 25:39.290]  to find that? Did I say Bovril was everywhere? I said, I found it in a vending machine at a
[25:39.290 --> 25:44.470]  football game. I'm not out there buying it in the supermarket. It is, it's not readily available.
[25:44.670 --> 25:48.830]  And when I asked people for it, they all, all universally said, just get Vegemite. It's way
[25:48.830 --> 25:52.350]  better or just get Marmite. It's way better. And I'm like, yeah, but that's not what I want. I want
[25:52.350 --> 25:55.930]  Bovril. And they're like, no, you don't. And I had to like argue with people and they're like,
[25:55.990 --> 25:58.970]  listen, you don't want it. And I'm like, I'm telling you, I need it for a thing. And they're
[25:58.970 --> 26:05.550]  like, it must be in the supermarkets. Just get Marmite. So I was there, uh, for the other, one
[26:05.550 --> 26:09.990]  of the other podcasts I do, the theme park podcast, as well as for like a rooster teeth
[26:09.990 --> 26:15.330]  community meetup. So during the community meetup, uh, and I was doing this meetup with, um, uh,
[26:16.290 --> 26:20.510]  regular fan Jack. I'm not sure where he is in the hierarchy right now. It's called fan,
[26:21.070 --> 26:24.210]  fan Jack. Well, he's not a minor league fan anymore. I think, I think, I think he's up from
[26:24.210 --> 26:29.890]  minor league to just regular fan. But, uh, yeah, I think so. Uh, and so I was on a panel and somebody
[26:29.890 --> 26:34.990]  came up and gave it to me and it had a bow on it and they put like a little rooster teeth union
[26:34.990 --> 26:38.830]  Jack logo on it. And they were like, here, we got this for you and here's some boiling water.
[26:39.050 --> 26:43.230]  And here's something to spread it on. Will you eat it in front of everyone? And since it was being
[26:43.230 --> 26:48.050]  filmed, I thought, yeah, it's like, might as well. Cause also, uh, I wasn't sure I could bring
[26:48.050 --> 26:53.190]  it back to the States because somebody, uh, told me that you can't import it to the U S like you
[26:53.190 --> 26:57.850]  can't bring it from the UK to the U S. So you said you, you, you, it was being filmed. So you're
[26:57.850 --> 27:03.050]  like, yeah, no problem. Do you have that footage? Uh, I think, uh, I think my girlfriend Emily has,
[27:03.050 --> 27:06.610]  so I can get it to you guys. I don't have it on me. Great. And what were your thoughts? Uh,
[27:06.610 --> 27:14.130]  so I had it two ways. Uh, apparently, apparently the, the boy like, uh, making it like beef bouillon
[27:14.130 --> 27:19.590]  kind of boiling it is not the main way. I guess people mostly use it as a spread on toast, kind of
[27:19.590 --> 27:25.270]  like Marmite. Uh, so I had it that way first. Yeah. Oh, by the way, Andrew, uh, go ahead and eat
[27:25.270 --> 27:31.590]  number two. Okay. With your eyes closed, please. But while you're doing that, I'll upload the photo
[27:31.590 --> 27:37.450]  just for reference, uh, of me right before. Did he keep all the pops behind it behind him?
[27:37.750 --> 27:42.110]  I put it in the fridge and my mic stand is covering the fridge door. So I had to slide the
[27:42.110 --> 27:49.350]  mic. That was an immense chair Creek sliding. Okay. So I'm pulling the pop out. I'm so nervous. I
[27:49.350 --> 27:56.670]  should have like a puke bucket. This is okay. Pop two coming out. It is solid. Try to identify it
[27:56.670 --> 28:08.310]  without opening your eyes. Yeah. Oh, it's rubbing up. Oh, congratulations. So I've uploaded a photo.
[28:08.550 --> 28:13.650]  Uh, it's on the Instagram already. I think it's of me in a, by the way, a snazzy new regulation
[28:13.650 --> 28:19.610]  listener t-shirt, which I think is, uh, just, uh, and there's a regular fan Jack in the background
[28:19.610 --> 28:23.610]  and I'm holding the bottle that they gave me. Uh, so the first way I had it was as a spread.
[28:23.610 --> 28:29.930]  And I have to say it was fucking heinous, like absolutely disgusting. If you've ever had
[28:29.930 --> 28:35.530]  Vegemite, if you've ever had Marmite, this is just as bad, if not like 5% worse. I mean, just
[28:35.530 --> 28:45.630]  dog shit, not edible, just not edible. However, then I took a teaspoon and of, of this goop and
[28:45.630 --> 28:49.910]  I stuck it in the boiling water and I spun it around a little bit and made like the hot Bovril
[28:49.910 --> 28:55.850]  cup, like you would have at a football game. Yeah. And I give it a, I give it a 5.2 out of 10.
[28:56.250 --> 29:00.510]  Okay. And what was the first one? Dog shit out of 10 and then 5.2 out of 10.
[29:00.530 --> 29:04.570]  Yeah. Like I found myself throughout the panel still sipping it a little bit. I probably ended
[29:04.570 --> 29:09.310]  up drinking half, half of a little Dixie cup full of, of Bovril. Uh, yeah, it's not great,
[29:09.370 --> 29:14.990]  but in that form I can see like on a cold day, you like, you kind of want a little nourishment
[29:14.990 --> 29:19.230]  and to be warmed up. I can see in, in much the same way, maybe you would drink like
[29:19.230 --> 29:27.890]  hot bone broth or like a bouillon. I can see it being a hearty drink. Utilitarian. I've never had
[29:27.890 --> 29:32.270]  it as a spread, so I'll probably try that at some point, but yeah, I don't, I don't mind it as a hot
[29:32.270 --> 29:37.670]  Bovril. Also at a glance, Jack's t-shirt in the corner of my eye looked like it said anal passage.
[29:40.790 --> 29:44.810]  That's the other podcast I do. Anal passage. Can we, can we just sell that shirt remade as
[29:44.810 --> 29:51.950]  anal passage? Check those. As a face shirt? Eric, Eric, can you get on that please?
[29:56.530 --> 29:57.490]  I would wear that.
[30:07.200 --> 30:08.940]  We gotta do that. That's awesome.
[30:11.020 --> 30:15.300]  Jack would think at a glance that I'm repping the merch, but it's really just...
[30:19.200 --> 30:23.280]  You know what would be the ultimate? What would be the ultimate is if we, we work it out with
[30:23.280 --> 30:28.480]  his wife. So she switches out the annual pass shirt in his laundry for an anal passage shirt
[30:28.480 --> 30:32.880]  and see if we can get him, see if we can get him to wear it without knowing he's wearing
[30:32.880 --> 30:36.960]  an anal passage shirt. We're gonna, we would have to move fast on that before this episode comes out.
[30:37.520 --> 30:41.680]  Yeah. Which is uh, less than a week. It's Tuesday.
[30:45.600 --> 30:50.160]  Christ. We have to like swap the shirt and put it right at the top of the pile. Okay. But we've
[30:50.160 --> 30:55.160]  kind of, this is like the bat paranoia. He now will have to check his annual pass shirt always.
[30:55.320 --> 31:00.240]  He's going to have to constantly double check that shirt. So it kind of works no matter what.
[31:00.240 --> 31:01.920]  We've created shirt paranoia.
[31:06.820 --> 31:10.300]  Oh, Eric's already sent it off to the merch team. Okay. So there you go. There's your,
[31:11.040 --> 31:15.860]  there's your, uh, seven up, uh, Bov Pop. Oh, very clear. So you just...
[31:15.860 --> 31:21.120]  I did. I took a bite out of the top of it. Dodge the Bov is a great name for this. So I'm just
[31:21.120 --> 31:25.020]  going to steal that, Geoff. That's fantastic. We're trying to dodge the Bov. Yeah. How,
[31:25.200 --> 31:27.840]  on a scale of one to 10, how do you rate the Sprite Pop?
[31:28.260 --> 31:31.660]  Nine. It was way better than I anticipated. That was delicious.
[31:32.340 --> 31:36.900]  Damn. I like as well. You, you've just outright refused to try hot Bov Roll here.
[31:37.100 --> 31:40.340]  You've gone straight for the Bov Pop. I've gone straight for the Bov Pop. Yeah.
[31:40.980 --> 31:44.580]  I didn't, I guess I could have used the Keurig to heat up the Bov, right? Isn't that a thing
[31:44.580 --> 31:51.220]  I can do then? Yeah. Bov machine. Ramen and Bov exclusively. That's what that Keurig is for.
[31:53.020 --> 31:56.260]  Maybe that's, dude, there should be a Bov Roll flavored ramen.
[31:56.260 --> 32:03.220]  Oh my God. That's like the hot new thing. A Bov Roll cake up. I saw so many videos
[32:03.220 --> 32:06.480]  of people pouring Bov Roll down the sink after trying it.
[32:10.780 --> 32:15.540]  It's, it's really, honestly, hot Bov Roll is not as bad as I thought it would be. It is,
[32:15.660 --> 32:20.620]  it's drinkable. I wouldn't choose it, but I would, in much the same way, like for people who don't
[32:20.620 --> 32:25.720]  like coffee, but need to be, need to be warm on a cold day, I could see it absolutely doing the trick.
[32:25.720 --> 32:31.380]  That makes sense to me. Yeah. I saw a few, um, comment leavers from St. Kilda, uh, saying that
[32:31.380 --> 32:35.160]  they've been on the pier and stuff. And it, and it was weird to hear their, the place they live
[32:35.160 --> 32:42.340]  mentioned on Fun Face. Oh, really? The, the reach of this podcast. Yeah. It's crazy. Cause that's
[32:42.340 --> 32:47.760]  far away. Yeah. You know what else is interesting? Talking about the reach. So, you know, I did this
[32:47.760 --> 32:53.560]  panel and there were, you know, maybe a hundred, uh, genera, general Rooster Teeth community members
[32:53.560 --> 32:58.040]  there. Right. Yeah. And, uh, I was surprised how many of them do not listen to this podcast.
[32:58.380 --> 33:03.540]  We got to do a better job of convincing people to listen to this podcast. Oh, so not a lot of,
[33:03.740 --> 33:08.520]  uh, regulation listeners. There were more, I'd say like maybe half were regulation listeners.
[33:08.600 --> 33:13.740]  The other half had no idea what we were talking about. They weren't up to date on anal passages.
[33:16.260 --> 33:20.180]  Just realize we've got some work to do. We've got work to do within our own larger community
[33:20.180 --> 33:24.700]  to, uh, to reach out to those people. Eric says, sure it's being worked on.
[33:26.780 --> 33:32.300]  Just open up the Photoshop file. Oh dear. Oh dear. Yeah. Yeah. How do,
[33:32.360 --> 33:35.780]  how do we get more people to listen to this or is it better that more people don't?
[33:35.780 --> 33:40.700]  It's like our little secret podcast exclusive club. Good question. Yeah. I don't, I don't know.
[33:40.780 --> 33:46.060]  I mean, animated will come out at some point, potentially. Like that'll be a good reach for
[33:46.060 --> 33:50.000]  people. It's kind of tough. It's a tough thing to jump into. It's funny. As I said,
[33:50.000 --> 33:54.560]  getting texts from the My Hubbies Bagels people. Oh, and speaking of that, I never said on the
[33:54.560 --> 34:00.300]  show, there is a regulation bagel. The regulation bagel exists now. It is a definitive thing. You can
[34:00.300 --> 34:04.780]  order it. It's on the menu. I did my research. I tried a bunch of different combinations of the
[34:04.780 --> 34:11.440]  thing. The regulation bagel is a bagel. I like it on a cheddar bagel, but I guess it could be on any
[34:11.440 --> 34:15.900]  bagel, especially dependent on availability of the bagels. But I would say a cheddar bagel is not
[34:15.900 --> 34:21.120]  regulation is a bagel. Doesn't doesn't matter. This is my regulation bagel. This is this is
[34:21.120 --> 34:27.520]  how I've worked this out. This is regulation for the show. It is half of it is the bacon cream
[34:27.520 --> 34:32.940]  cheese that they have. And the other half is the garlic and black pepper cream cheese. Half and
[34:32.940 --> 34:39.240]  half as a sandwich. Incredible. So that's really good. It's really fucking good. Now, is this a hot
[34:39.240 --> 34:44.680]  bagel? You get it toasted there. It's your choice. I get it toasted. I ask for a regulation bagel
[34:44.680 --> 34:51.720]  toasted. Step to the side. Get my bagel. It's fantastic. I'd highly recommend. What did it feel
[34:51.720 --> 34:59.140]  like to stand in line and order your own creation for this? It's funny you say that, Geoff. They have
[34:59.140 --> 35:03.980]  sold out every day like they've been so popular. It's been amazing. Like they've gotten so much
[35:03.980 --> 35:08.680]  love from the community and just well, our community and just the community in which I live in
[35:08.680 --> 35:13.320]  generally. Yeah, they have so much support. They're selling out all the time. Their lines.
[35:13.320 --> 35:20.300]  So I decided I was going to go there super early. They open at 8 a.m. I left to go there and I was
[35:20.300 --> 35:26.100]  in line at 7 a.m. Like I'm going to be the first person in line. Did they open early and sell all
[35:26.100 --> 35:37.800]  the bagels to you and then everyone in the line was pissed off? No. I did not have a whole lot of
[35:37.800 --> 35:44.460]  people mad at me. This is a great face on me, though. This is a classic. So I show up at 7 a.m.
[35:44.740 --> 35:48.120]  When do you think the next person showed up to join this line that I'd created?
[35:48.560 --> 35:59.240]  7.58. 7.58? 7.43 was the next. I spent 43 minutes in a line of one. 43 minutes just by myself.
[35:59.380 --> 36:06.460]  Then a couple, a couple showed up at 7.43. They were behind me. And then one other group showed
[36:06.460 --> 36:11.760]  up at 7.52, when we were let in a little bit early. They opened up at 7.52. They typically
[36:11.760 --> 36:19.220]  opened up at 8. I got there an hour early for a three-person line. But I got all my stuff.
[36:19.400 --> 36:24.420]  I ordered all the bagels. I ordered the challah bread. I got the regulation bagel. I was so happy.
[36:24.580 --> 36:29.440]  It was a great experience. Ever since they've opened, they have sold out every single day by
[36:29.440 --> 36:35.800]  noon. The only day they haven't sold out was the day that I showed up at 7 a.m. I think they may
[36:35.800 --> 36:39.900]  have sold out before it closed. But it was like they went the whole day with bagels. So it was
[36:39.900 --> 36:44.600]  just a quiet day. The one day that I showed up an hour early, it wouldn't have mattered. I could
[36:44.600 --> 36:50.680]  have come later in the day. How were the line pleasantries? There was really a non-existent
[36:50.680 --> 36:53.740]  line. There were not great line pleasantries. You didn't talk to the other couple?
[36:53.800 --> 36:56.280]  You didn't try to... I would have tried to push the regulation bagel. You'd be like,
[36:56.360 --> 36:59.140]  hey, have you guys been here before? I hear there's this thing called the regulation bagel
[36:59.140 --> 37:02.820]  that everybody's trying. Yeah, like a secret. I love when you order it in, it comes in on the
[37:02.820 --> 37:09.180]  menu as secret regulation bagel is how it's categorized. It's fantastic. It's been awesome
[37:09.180 --> 37:14.260]  seeing people take photos with their regulation bagels. It's delicious. And yeah, it's great.
[37:14.920 --> 37:18.300]  Not great line pleasantries, though. It was cold. I'd been there for like 40,
[37:18.740 --> 37:23.040]  42 minutes just with shorts. It was just freezing. I was so cold.
[37:24.100 --> 37:29.280]  How'd the ankles hold up? You know, I got a little... I kind of pulled... I pulled something
[37:29.280 --> 37:34.360]  a little bit, but we're OK. We're fine. I was worried. I was sitting in front. Like you kind
[37:34.360 --> 37:38.100]  of walk up to the store and a person walked by with their dog and I thought they were going to
[37:38.100 --> 37:41.320]  go into the line. So I was like, fuck, I need to be in line. I want to be the first one in.
[37:41.500 --> 37:45.220]  And so I immediately shot up and twisted and I felt like a little tightness in the Achilles.
[37:45.400 --> 37:48.720]  I was like, I'm a fucking idiot, but I'm good. I'm good. No issues. We're all fine.
[37:49.900 --> 37:52.540]  100 percent. Push the marathon another six months.
[37:54.320 --> 38:00.760]  And you got up too fast to get a bagel. I did not even to get a bagel to hold the line,
[38:00.840 --> 38:06.520]  to maintain my status in line as the first person to go in. Oh, Eric's got a good point.
[38:07.300 --> 38:15.660]  Gab, you pick. Five. Oh, one, two, three, four. OK, here we go. OK, this one's still...
[38:15.660 --> 38:20.340]  this is frozen as well. Oh, fuck. I'm so nervous.
[38:49.720 --> 38:52.520]  Oh, God.
[38:52.540 --> 39:02.280]  I just feel like I won a game of Battleship. You sank our panting. Oh, my God.
[39:07.160 --> 39:12.920]  And you did not dodge the ball. Oh, my God. That sucks so much.
[39:14.000 --> 39:20.060]  Direct hit. Direct fucking hit, Gavin. Face brushing roulette.
[39:20.060 --> 39:21.520]  Oh, you're taking another bite.
[39:26.180 --> 39:28.860]  I drooled. I drooled on myself.
[39:32.220 --> 39:38.180]  Fucking criminals. Who likes that? Well, nobody has it like that, you fool.
[39:40.340 --> 39:44.600]  Describe the taste. It's beefy. It's very beefy.
[40:02.600 --> 40:10.720]  Oh, my God. I can taste it in my mouth. That's why you taste things.
[40:11.400 --> 40:19.060]  No, but like, it still is poignant. Oh, my God. It's the taste hasn't left. It's still there.
[40:19.680 --> 40:23.040]  So it's nine out of ten for Seven Up. What was this one?
[40:24.780 --> 40:33.460]  Negative six. That's... you can't. No, it was bad. I just did. There's no way that's worse than
[40:33.460 --> 40:41.920]  frozen sour cream. We'll find out potentially. Oh, Jesus Christ. I think Nick's onto something.
[40:42.100 --> 40:47.640]  We should call it the... put it in chat. Freezy Beefy. We should call it the Freezy Beefy Barf Pop.
[40:49.960 --> 40:53.040]  Oh, my God. We should make a bunch and give them to kids at Halloween.
[40:53.520 --> 40:58.120]  No, man. I need to see the picture. I'm sending it right now. Oh, yeah, please, please.
[41:00.540 --> 41:05.440]  Oh, Jesus Christ. Eww. It looks fizzy.
[41:07.300 --> 41:12.500]  I could have believed that would be the frozen soda. Yeah, it looks like a Coke. That's what
[41:12.500 --> 41:16.280]  I kind of thought when I could see it. I wasn't sure if it would be frozen Coke or Bovril,
[41:16.280 --> 41:23.520]  and I would probably assume that that was the Coke. Like a 50-50 draw. Oh, oh, God. That was
[41:23.520 --> 41:28.920]  so bad. Well, if you need to be warmed up, I know of a good drink you can have. Yeah, maybe next
[41:28.920 --> 41:37.100]  time. Next episode. Stick that in the Keurig. Oh, my God. Well, that was amazing. Oh, Jesus.
[41:37.620 --> 41:46.060]  We still got four more. Yeah, I tell you what, I feel bad for you. Let me go ahead and... why
[41:46.060 --> 41:54.060]  don't you wash the taste out of your mouth? Oh, no. Okay. This one's also frozen. Oh, that's a good
[41:54.060 --> 42:02.160]  one. That's got to be refreshing. Oh, this is great. There you go. That's cool.
[42:17.040 --> 42:25.060]  How the fuck? What a great game. Oh, God damn. So you had a good time in Europe, Geoff?
[42:25.580 --> 42:29.780]  I did. I had a great time in the UK. I did all the... it was Emily's first time going,
[42:29.960 --> 42:36.020]  so we did all the tourist stuff. And I did... Oh, my God. Have you guys ever seen a musical?
[42:36.620 --> 42:44.480]  Oh, they're pretty cool. Yeah. I saw Phantom of the Opera because I found out that even though
[42:44.480 --> 42:49.840]  my girlfriend had been dating for almost five years, she had been harboring a secret that she
[42:49.840 --> 42:56.040]  had never admitted to me. And that secret was, she is the world's largest Andrew Lloyd Webber
[42:56.040 --> 43:02.300]  fan. And she can sing every song from every Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. So the second she
[43:02.300 --> 43:06.460]  found out we were going to London, she got us tickets to see Phantom of the Opera, which I knew
[43:06.460 --> 43:14.280]  nothing about. Wow. Zero, zero about. And so now I know everything about it because I saw it.
[43:14.320 --> 43:19.280]  Was it about a burn victim? Yeah, it's about a burn victim and a hospital ward. Yeah. And they...
[43:20.040 --> 43:25.840]  No, it's about a phantom who lives in an opera house and haunts a play. But there's this giant
[43:25.840 --> 43:31.180]  chandelier. Whole thing's about a chandelier, basically. And that's a big moment. But at this
[43:31.180 --> 43:34.560]  theater, which is the theater that originally... it's like the... I don't know what it's called,
[43:34.560 --> 43:39.780]  like the Queen Victoria Theater or some shit. And it was... it's played there every day since
[43:39.780 --> 43:47.400]  1984. She bought this $60 VIP experience. And because we were the only people who got that
[43:47.400 --> 43:53.260]  experience, probably because the play's been out for 106 years, they gave us an upgrade.
[43:53.600 --> 43:58.740]  And there's a little room off to the side that was built for Queen Victoria when she would go to
[43:58.740 --> 44:05.360]  plays. And then Lady Di apparently was a huge Phantom fan. And so that was the room she would
[44:05.360 --> 44:11.060]  hang out in. So we got to hang out in a little room off to the side by ourselves where it was like
[44:11.060 --> 44:16.460]  real gold on the walls and shit. And I got to use the same toilet that Lady Diana used when she would
[44:16.460 --> 44:21.020]  go see Phantom of the Opera. Did you poo? No, I just peed. I just peed. I don't want to be
[44:21.020 --> 44:31.160]  disrespectful to the crown. So I just tinkered. But yeah, I have hung out in similar circles as
[44:32.220 --> 44:36.780]  British royalty now. I've not seen a lot of musicals. I saw Cats and it was a boring piece
[44:36.780 --> 44:43.540]  of shit. Mamma Mia was better. A movie? Are we talking movies? No, the musical. Okay, I'm just
[44:43.540 --> 44:48.260]  asking. Mamma Mia was better because it had ABBA songs, but that was about it. I can't do ABBA.
[44:48.260 --> 44:55.460]  Not an ABBA fan? What's wrong with ABBA? I have a childhood memory associated to ABBA and I just
[44:55.460 --> 45:03.220]  can't. I can't consume ABBA. I've avoided ABBA my whole life. Go ahead. Yeah, would you like to?
[45:03.560 --> 45:07.900]  I'm willing to talk about it for sure. Do you want to guess? You were at a wedding.
[45:08.620 --> 45:17.240]  Dancing Queen came on. No. No. There was a kid who threw a birthday party
[45:18.140 --> 45:24.960]  at school. He had his birthday party during class hours and he was very musical. I don't know,
[45:25.080 --> 45:30.840]  but he pulled it off and he was very musical. He loved singing and he decided to do a rendition
[45:30.840 --> 45:37.580]  of ABBA's Golden... what was it? Eyes, the eye song. Pretty Eyes, Golden Eyes. What's the ABBA
[45:37.580 --> 45:43.780]  song? Golden Eyes? Angel Eyes. That's what I was looking for. How does that go? They say Angel Eyes
[45:43.780 --> 45:48.680]  a lot. That's all I remember about it. But they did a performance of Angel Eyes in front of the
[45:48.680 --> 45:54.480]  entire class and it did not go well. It was one of the most awkward, uncomfortable things I've
[45:54.480 --> 45:59.120]  ever had to witness that I felt terrible about. And because of that, whenever I hear ABBA,
[45:59.120 --> 46:04.940]  I immediately just go to that memory and I just did awkward and uncomfortable. So I've not been
[46:04.940 --> 46:09.000]  able to enjoy. Mamma Mia might be tough for me. I've avoided Mamma Mia because of that.
[46:09.340 --> 46:14.880]  I don't know Angel Eyes by ABBA. I think somebody... was Nick just posted a link to Angel Eyes? Yeah.
[46:15.320 --> 46:19.600]  It's... I don't know if it's a hit. I'm not familiar really with their catalog because
[46:19.600 --> 46:26.320]  of that experience. But whenever I hear ABBA, I get taken back to grade four, grade four or five,
[46:27.060 --> 46:32.900]  watching this rendition of Angel Eyes and just cringing. It did not go well.
[46:33.660 --> 46:37.380]  We got to get you back into ABBA. We got to get an ABBA redemption for you.
[46:37.900 --> 46:41.060]  If you give me an ABBA, I'm willing to try. Fernando is like a top ten all-time song.
[46:41.720 --> 46:47.120]  What is? Oh, Fernando? Yeah. Fernando, yeah. Even that has been tainted. It's unfortunate that ABBA
[46:47.120 --> 46:50.660]  has been tainted for me, but it's just I can't... I can't get around it. Or at least I haven't been
[46:50.660 --> 46:56.420]  able to yet. Great band, though. Just I can't... can't do it. I don't think I've ever seen...
[46:57.100 --> 47:02.340]  does it count if you watch like a streamed musical? Like I went to the theater and watched
[47:02.340 --> 47:09.500]  a streamed version of Company when Colbert was, I think, the lead at that time. But I've never been
[47:09.500 --> 47:14.700]  to like a proper musical, like in the... in the place. Have you ever been to a musical, Geoff?
[47:14.720 --> 47:19.900]  Is this your first in-person musical? I've been to a lot of theater in my life, but I don't think
[47:19.900 --> 47:25.340]  I've ever been to a musical before. Yeah. I can't imagine the circumstances that would have led me
[47:25.340 --> 47:34.360]  to see a musical by choice up until this moment. So yeah, I... this is my first time. I've quite...
[47:34.360 --> 47:40.000]  quite enjoyed it, though. That's great. So you're now open to going to like more musicals? You're
[47:40.000 --> 47:46.180]  gonna become a musical guy, potentially? No, for instance, regular fan Jack found out we were going
[47:46.180 --> 47:51.500]  to see... found out we were going to see Phantom of the Opera and he said, oh, that's great. I'm
[47:51.500 --> 47:55.580]  gonna go see the Back to the Future musical tomorrow. You should come with me. And I was like,
[47:55.600 --> 48:01.340]  it's not gonna happen. So no, I don't think so. I think it'd be very specific. To share the
[48:01.340 --> 48:06.260]  experience with my girlfriend and only... only a musical that she has vetted. I don't want to see
[48:06.260 --> 48:11.960]  pop culture. That is... yeah, that's fair. I also feel like it's a different thing. I'm more interested
[48:11.960 --> 48:17.980]  in seeing a musical that was crafted as a musical as opposed to anything that was adapted from a
[48:17.980 --> 48:22.680]  movie into a musical. It may be amazing, but it's just... it's that I'm... if I'm getting into
[48:22.680 --> 48:28.380]  musicals, I want to hit like the musical part first instead of... Yeah, well, to be fair, I think
[48:28.380 --> 48:34.540]  Phantom is a... was a rendition of a old early 1900s movie that was based off a book. But it's...
[48:34.540 --> 48:38.280]  I mean, I think that when you think of Phantom of the Opera, you think of this play. There are
[48:38.740 --> 48:43.320]  Andrew Lloyd Webber. Absolutely. It's synonymous with it. So I think he kind of owns that story at
[48:43.320 --> 48:48.260]  this point. But I'll probably see like Les Mis. Like apparently my girlfriend's big on that one,
[48:48.340 --> 48:52.160]  so I'll probably have to have to sit through that at some point. That's not a bad one. I've
[48:52.160 --> 48:56.440]  only seen the movie, but it was enjoyable. Yeah, I've seen none of it, so it'll be fresh for me.
[48:57.140 --> 49:02.200]  I saw the first half of the Gerard Butler Phantom of the Opera. I didn't finish it,
[49:02.240 --> 49:06.020]  though. I don't remember anything about it. I walked out halfway through and went into Fat
[49:06.020 --> 49:10.100]  Albert that was playing at the time. That was much more my speed. I had a much better time at
[49:10.100 --> 49:17.600]  Fat Albert. Kenan Thompson's live action Fat Albert. Kenan Thompson's going to be the most
[49:17.600 --> 49:23.260]  mentioned person on this podcast. I didn't even think about that. I would imagine so, yeah.
[49:24.460 --> 49:28.040]  I wonder if somebody could go do and do a person count. It'd be him.
[49:28.440 --> 49:34.260]  Coolio gets mentioned a lot. Oh, we need to guess another for the previously on guy.
[49:34.260 --> 49:39.300]  That's a great point. I had that in my notes. Do you two have any questions you would like to ask
[49:39.300 --> 49:44.140]  before making your guess? Seeing a lot of comment leavers say it's like Caleb or Drew Saplin. It's
[49:44.140 --> 49:47.740]  neither of them. Neither of those. I don't I don't think I've ever heard this voice before.
[49:48.280 --> 49:53.120]  It sounds like someone from the West Coast. OK, I mean, are you just stating that? Is that a
[49:53.120 --> 49:58.120]  question for me or? OK, you're just you're speaking out loud. I sort of have forgotten
[49:58.120 --> 50:03.440]  the questions I've already asked about. Yeah, it's rough doing this every couple of weeks.
[50:04.540 --> 50:08.660]  Uh, all right, Gav, you go first. Can I have an official question first?
[50:09.400 --> 50:12.720]  I don't know what that means. Yeah, of course you can ask a question and then you can make
[50:12.720 --> 50:19.180]  your guess. What season of F*** Face are they a part of? Oh, Jesus Christ. You expect me to
[50:19.180 --> 50:26.280]  remember the catalog, our absurd season system? We're in season four right now, correct? Yeah.
[50:26.400 --> 50:33.640]  Uh huh. I would assume that they were in season two. OK, OK. Pretty early on.
[50:34.260 --> 50:38.100]  I feel like season two went on a long time. I feel like that's covering a lot of ground. Season
[50:38.100 --> 50:43.820]  three was what? Three episodes? So. Uh, I don't even think. Yeah.
[50:47.880 --> 50:56.020]  Is it Roadmaster 74? I don't know. Who is Roadmaster 74? I don't know. I remember Geoff
[50:56.020 --> 51:00.660]  saying it. No, it is not Roadmaster 74. Geoff, do you have any questions?
[51:02.640 --> 51:07.440]  I mean, I would like to know who Roadmaster 74 even f***ing is and why I would have said that name.
[51:07.780 --> 51:11.420]  I only know that name because you were saying you were like, I'm going to say Roadmaster 74.
[51:11.860 --> 51:14.500]  I'm going to keep saying his name Roadmaster 74. And then you
[51:14.500 --> 51:16.760]  immediately got his name wrong. And like the next time you mentioned.
[51:20.180 --> 51:29.100]  Uh, is it is it somebody who appeared on the the F*** Face Christmas album? No. OK. Oh,
[51:29.100 --> 51:33.940]  were they in F*** Face? Can't ask two questions. You already asked. You asked earlier.
[51:34.240 --> 51:38.460]  Remind me to ask that next time. Is it the person who? Because I can I can now ask.
[51:38.700 --> 51:43.280]  So that was my question. Now, can I make a guess? You can make your guess. I guess it's
[51:43.280 --> 51:50.760]  the person who played Gavin in the F*** Face recording. That was a female voice. That was
[51:50.760 --> 51:55.280]  a Welsh woman. Yeah. So that's that's a no. That's a no on that one. But I appreciate your shot.
[51:58.820 --> 52:02.460]  Damn. I think you could argue that was the worst guess by far. Like,
[52:02.740 --> 52:05.700]  I don't think there's who's arguing.
[52:08.440 --> 52:12.600]  I was going to say, I feel like you asked the same question back to back or Gavin wasn't.
[52:12.740 --> 52:16.520]  There's something where you guys both asked the same question. I think that was worse than that.
[52:16.620 --> 52:21.940]  No, that was one when Nick asked the same. Oh, OK. That's what it was. Yeah. Nick missed it.
[52:21.940 --> 52:26.600]  I have a question. But while Gavin's asking that question, why don't you go ahead and eat the
[52:26.600 --> 52:32.580]  fourth pop? Oh, yeah. Number four. OK. Yeah. Geoff, while Andrew's eating that,
[52:32.660 --> 52:38.920]  you were a Game of Thrones fan, right? Yes, I was. Yeah. Oh, no. How do you pronounce this name?
[52:39.680 --> 52:48.440]  Hold on. Oh, no. That's Anus Targaryen. OK. Oh, no. I don't remember that character from the show.
[52:48.440 --> 52:51.800]  I don't either, but that's, I'm pretty sure that's Anus. Yeah.
[52:54.860 --> 53:02.840]  George RR Martin's taking the piss. Yeah. Yeah. Well, Anus Targaryen, first of his name.
[53:07.620 --> 53:14.100]  Yeah. It went, uh, according to this, when Aegon Targaryen,
[53:14.240 --> 53:16.940]  Anus Targaryen, and then back to Aegon Targaryen.
[53:17.340 --> 53:21.940]  So we have a problem. This family tree's a mess. Oh, OK. I pulled it. Is it non-frozen?
[53:22.460 --> 53:31.200]  I pulled it. That looks like sour cream. Oh, it's all the smell. I just got hit with smell.
[53:32.060 --> 53:38.300]  Oh, it's sour. Scoop it out. Oh, you're gonna have to spoon it. I fucking hate you,
[53:38.420 --> 53:44.220]  Gavin. You're two for two on bad. Geoff, did you pick that? No. Yeah, I picked that one. You did?
[53:44.220 --> 53:49.280]  I don't even. Yeah, I picked it. I apologize. You can still hate Gavin. That's fine.
[53:50.400 --> 53:57.320]  OK, I guess I'll try to scoop it out. Yeah. Yeah. God. OK. Oh, this this like it's like
[53:57.320 --> 54:02.560]  soft, soft serve salad cream. It's that Bastro salad cream. Oh, is that batter?
[54:03.080 --> 54:05.300]  It could be batter, but it looks like bat cream.
[54:06.700 --> 54:10.620]  A pancake. It's pancake batter. Thank you. Yeah, that's probably quite yummy then.
[54:14.040 --> 54:22.100]  Whoa. The noises are different. Oh, this is gross, but it's not bad.
[54:22.540 --> 54:25.120]  OK, where would you rate it? A one.
[54:26.860 --> 54:34.080]  Nine, negative six and one. Mm hmm. This is this is gross, but it's not bad.
[54:35.260 --> 54:42.660]  Well, I would. The idea, once you mentally get past what you're doing, it's not it's not the
[54:42.660 --> 54:47.920]  worst. So just still pick a good one, then. OK, that's welcome. We're not good. Never mind.
[54:48.000 --> 54:56.040]  I retract everything I said. This is horrible. Oh. Is this the non-frozen one? No.
[54:57.260 --> 55:05.320]  Oh, that's the frozen one. So you have one and three left are your final final two.
[55:06.780 --> 55:11.720]  OK, Gavin, why don't you take a guess? One. OK.
[55:11.720 --> 55:18.740]  I I fucking hate you so much. I hate you.
[55:20.540 --> 55:27.460]  This is the one that isn't that isn't frozen. So this has to be this has to be salad cream.
[55:27.640 --> 55:34.800]  Maybe it's like the oil content. OK, pulling one. Oh, it's so gross.
[55:37.240 --> 55:40.160]  It's so gross. Two for two, baby.
[55:40.980 --> 55:47.840]  Thank you, Gavin. You're a good man. Oh, OK, I'm going to I'm going to take a photo of.
[55:49.800 --> 55:52.060]  On the bright side, it'll get that batter out of your mouth.
[55:52.740 --> 55:55.700]  Oh, I don't know if that's a positive. I think I'd rather have the batter.
[55:58.540 --> 56:04.560]  It looks like tapioca pudding. Oh, that's so bad. It's so translucent at the edges.
[56:04.560 --> 56:10.660]  Oh, it's horrendous. That's the salad. It's hideous. Oh, when were these frozen?
[56:11.240 --> 56:18.600]  Uh, yesterday. So this has been frozen all night. And it looks like that all night. Oh, God.
[56:20.080 --> 56:26.440]  OK, well, I guess I'm just going to have some salad cream. Oh, God. Without your salad.
[56:33.640 --> 56:39.140]  Yeah. I got to go. Oh.
[56:45.180 --> 56:48.360]  Should we end the process with him retching in the back?
[56:50.820 --> 56:53.220]  No, I don't think anyone's ever eaten those things in that order.
[56:53.940 --> 56:59.320]  Oh, no, that's a world first, right? Andrew Panton is the first person in the
[56:59.320 --> 57:05.080]  history of the planet Earth to eat those ingredients in that state, in that order.
[57:05.540 --> 57:09.480]  Congratulations. That deserves to be in the Guinness Book of Gross-Ass Records.
[57:09.880 --> 57:11.020]  That's the punch and gourd look.
[57:12.280 --> 57:18.780]  Oh, thank you for listening to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast. Hopefully, as we outro,
[57:19.020 --> 57:22.980]  you can continue to hear the dulcet sounds of Andrew retching all over his bedroom.
[57:24.180 --> 57:28.100]  If you want to go ahead and leave us a review
[57:28.100 --> 57:33.960]  or a rating, believe it or not, that shit matters and it helps. And as I found out in the UK,
[57:34.460 --> 57:39.160]  you know, there's like seven, a little over seven billion people on Earth, Gavin.
[57:40.800 --> 57:45.380]  Most of them don't listen to F*** Face. So if you have access to those seven billion people,
[57:45.700 --> 57:51.720]  give them a gentle nudge. Let them know. We got salad cream, frozen bomb pops. We got
[57:51.720 --> 57:58.160]  bovril, hot and cold. We got we got apples. We got baseballs. We got whatever you want.
[57:59.280 --> 58:04.540]  We make content out of it. And yeah, Andrew, why don't you go ahead and play us out?
[58:07.340 --> 58:11.560]  Hey, guys, Minor League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[58:11.940 --> 58:16.540]  We still don't know who the previously on guy is. Let's talk about being John Malkovich.
[58:16.540 --> 58:21.540]  This podcast needs more shirts. Pantin goes on a rant about people dying in movies.
[58:22.060 --> 58:25.560]  Will we find out the fate of Geoff's Cosmic Crisp? And once again,
[58:25.680 --> 58:30.300]  Andrew does not eat the pencil. All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
