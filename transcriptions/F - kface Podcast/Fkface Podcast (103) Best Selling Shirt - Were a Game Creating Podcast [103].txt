[00:15.230 --> 00:19.410]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face podcast.
[00:19.670 --> 00:22.670]  This is number 103. Yes, that's right.
[00:22.690 --> 00:29.850]  One hundred and three of season four, year two, volume one.
[00:30.550 --> 00:34.070]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Gavin Free and Andrew Panton.
[00:34.450 --> 00:36.490]  Hi, guys. Hi. Hi.
[00:36.670 --> 00:38.290]  How's it going? I'm doing really well.
[00:38.570 --> 00:39.570]  This has been a fun week.
[00:39.570 --> 00:42.330]  I've enjoyed seeing all the anal passage.
[00:43.990 --> 00:47.470]  I would need to, I would love to, because I don't have the same.
[00:47.770 --> 00:49.730]  I don't interact with Jack all that much.
[00:49.930 --> 00:55.850]  I watched the Rooster Teeth podcast, which Jack was on on Monday, and it felt
[00:55.850 --> 00:59.530]  I know it wasn't scripted, but the fact he wore that shirt
[00:59.530 --> 01:01.490]  felt scripted in the best way.
[01:01.850 --> 01:05.150]  But his reactions were so genuine that like there's no way
[01:05.150 --> 01:06.510]  that that was done intentionally.
[01:06.830 --> 01:08.710]  No, I'll be honest with you.
[01:09.210 --> 01:15.250]  I was my fucking I was trying to pick my jaw up off the ground
[01:15.250 --> 01:19.350]  from the second he walked in to the studio
[01:19.350 --> 01:23.910]  because the idea that he would wear the exact shirt
[01:23.910 --> 01:28.510]  during the middle of the joke about the shirt.
[01:28.830 --> 01:33.270]  And honestly, the only intersection in content where it would ever make sense
[01:33.670 --> 01:35.170]  was in live in that moment.
[01:35.170 --> 01:36.810]  It was such serendipity.
[01:36.810 --> 01:39.330]  I immediately thought nobody's going to believe this.
[01:39.650 --> 01:40.730]  No, and it's such a shame.
[01:41.170 --> 01:42.190]  Nobody's going to believe this.
[01:42.510 --> 01:44.730]  But holy shit, is this fortuitous?
[01:45.270 --> 01:48.750]  And but I think his cluelessness had to.
[01:48.750 --> 01:52.310]  It absolutely did, because I wasn't I was one of those people.
[01:52.550 --> 01:55.750]  Like I didn't have the context of like if that would have been organized
[01:55.750 --> 01:56.730]  or whatever, I would have known.
[01:56.830 --> 01:59.210]  So when I first saw it, I thought, oh, that's funny.
[01:59.250 --> 02:00.210]  He's leaning into it.
[02:00.450 --> 02:02.190]  And then his reactions were so clear.
[02:02.210 --> 02:03.790]  And just in case we didn't set up properly,
[02:03.870 --> 02:06.570]  Jack was on the Rooster Teeth podcast with you guys on Monday.
[02:06.810 --> 02:12.150]  And he was wearing the annual pass shirt that we turned into an anal passage shirt
[02:12.150 --> 02:13.650]  based on what Gavin said.
[02:13.910 --> 02:18.790]  And he had zero idea that the shirt had been for sale for four or five days.
[02:18.890 --> 02:21.830]  And I sat down next to him and I was like, oh, my God.
[02:22.030 --> 02:23.230]  And I just was like, no shirt.
[02:23.390 --> 02:25.790]  And then he was like, all right, what's going on with the shirt?
[02:25.890 --> 02:27.350]  And I was like, no way.
[02:27.430 --> 02:28.330]  He doesn't know.
[02:29.090 --> 02:32.290]  Yeah, he it eluded him through social media all weekend.
[02:32.450 --> 02:33.630]  So comment leavers.
[02:34.510 --> 02:37.230]  Thank you for for not spoiling it.
[02:37.410 --> 02:39.190]  Yes. And regulation listeners.
[02:39.310 --> 02:42.370]  Well, you just you did your job as well.
[02:42.470 --> 02:45.950]  I will say there are some snitches, though, and I saw you
[02:45.950 --> 02:49.530]  because I promoted it on on the FacePod Twitter account,
[02:49.610 --> 02:51.490]  but I deleted it in 15 minutes.
[02:51.650 --> 02:54.530]  I tweeted about it with a link, retweeted it and liked it
[02:54.530 --> 02:56.470]  and was like, I'm going to delete this in 15 minutes.
[02:56.470 --> 02:58.270]  And somebody immediately tagged him.
[02:58.470 --> 03:00.750]  I was like, ah, trying to ruin this joke.
[03:00.750 --> 03:03.770]  So there are people I see you trying to snitch on it.
[03:04.370 --> 03:07.150]  So no, no, I'm taking notes.
[03:07.330 --> 03:10.890]  I'm taking they might be on the list of 20,000 keeping a list.
[03:11.130 --> 03:12.590]  I still got spaces to fill.
[03:12.870 --> 03:14.450]  But I was just so happy that that came together.
[03:14.970 --> 03:19.330]  We improbably sold over 100 of those things, which that's wonderful.
[03:19.610 --> 03:21.350]  So ridiculous. That's great.
[03:22.630 --> 03:24.050]  Fantastic. Oh, man.
[03:24.490 --> 03:27.750]  So thank you to everybody who bought an anal passage shirt.
[03:27.750 --> 03:33.770]  And so that was a part of a hilarious joke that honestly, honestly,
[03:33.990 --> 03:34.970]  I think annoyed Jack.
[03:35.290 --> 03:36.550]  So that's what I was about to ask.
[03:36.850 --> 03:39.390]  Yeah. Have you talked to Jack about the shirt?
[03:39.510 --> 03:42.590]  I assume he listens to the show that he would have heard by now.
[03:43.110 --> 03:44.910]  He he texted me.
[03:45.310 --> 03:46.830]  Well, Gavin and I were at dinner, actually.
[03:46.950 --> 03:49.430]  We went out to Gavin and I went out to dinner the other night together
[03:49.430 --> 03:52.350]  with a bunch of old people who were really old and very old.
[03:52.470 --> 03:54.770]  And we were by far the coolest, youngest people there.
[03:55.690 --> 03:59.430]  And while I was at dinner, you were like, you were like, please sit next to me.
[04:03.030 --> 04:05.710]  That is a hundred percent true.
[04:06.690 --> 04:11.530]  He just texted me and he said, I'm counting those shirt sales to annual pass.
[04:12.910 --> 04:14.110]  I think that's fair.
[04:14.790 --> 04:17.230]  Yeah, that's totally fair. Official collab.
[04:20.610 --> 04:23.770]  He was definitely you can tell because I've been doing it
[04:23.770 --> 04:28.210]  for so very many years, you can tell when you genuinely get under his skin.
[04:28.350 --> 04:30.290]  He's gotten a lot better at hiding it.
[04:30.510 --> 04:33.610]  He's built some he's built some armor up over the last two decades.
[04:33.870 --> 04:38.110]  But but we definitely we definitely annoyed him.
[04:38.350 --> 04:40.090]  It's in all the best ways, all the best ways.
[04:40.170 --> 04:41.930]  And it's a great shirt. It's fantastic.
[04:42.870 --> 04:48.550]  I also speaking of texting people, I got so last episode we recorded,
[04:48.690 --> 04:50.890]  I introduced a game that we talked about.
[04:50.970 --> 04:53.670]  Guess who might be dead to everyone's favorite game?
[04:54.230 --> 04:58.810]  I was so happy the next day to have a text from Gavin in which he said,
[04:58.950 --> 05:01.290]  well, what do you say? I wrote down, I wrote that quote.
[05:01.450 --> 05:04.430]  He said, in quotes, Guess who might be dead, too?
[05:04.490 --> 05:06.210]  May have been the greatest game I've ever played.
[05:06.450 --> 05:07.750]  I was very excited about that.
[05:09.130 --> 05:10.610]  I'm glad you enjoyed it.
[05:10.690 --> 05:13.370]  Well, I was laughing at it because I thought about it again afterwards.
[05:13.490 --> 05:16.390]  And then when I was proofing it, maybe laugh again.
[05:16.490 --> 05:18.710]  And I was I just like that you referred to.
[05:20.470 --> 05:23.510]  You referred to the crucifixion as a real predicament.
[05:23.770 --> 05:28.650]  And I know that might be the most understated use of the word predicament ever.
[05:28.870 --> 05:30.150]  Is it not a predicament?
[05:31.370 --> 05:33.530]  It's not an ideal situation to be in.
[05:34.030 --> 05:37.830]  It's like, yeah, it's the predicament that predicaments might be based off of.
[05:37.990 --> 05:40.630]  Honestly, it could be. It could be the first predicament.
[05:43.750 --> 05:45.510]  The origin of the word is there.
[05:48.970 --> 05:51.030]  But the first predicament.
[05:51.030 --> 05:53.890]  I want to see that in the table of contents of the Bible.
[05:56.790 --> 05:58.970]  The Last Supper, the first predicament.
[06:02.230 --> 06:04.770]  The Last Supper leads into the first predicament.
[06:04.970 --> 06:05.710]  Yeah. Oh, my God.
[06:06.370 --> 06:09.250]  Oh, it was the calm before the predicament.
[06:09.430 --> 06:10.570]  You may be a little bit.
[06:11.370 --> 06:12.170]  God damn.
[06:12.350 --> 06:13.350]  I did. It's great.
[06:13.450 --> 06:15.250]  I'm glad we went down that road I didn't expect to go there.
[06:15.330 --> 06:19.570]  But so I got that text from Gavin and I thought, oh, I'm so glad that he enjoyed it.
[06:19.570 --> 06:24.410]  But the people at home, I'm sure they would want to play this amazing game.
[06:24.570 --> 06:29.090]  So I immediately reached out to the kind the kind guy,
[06:29.390 --> 06:33.610]  Michael's Games Labs, who made that that drop down in head game,
[06:33.650 --> 06:34.830]  the knob drop thing.
[06:34.990 --> 06:39.490]  And we have a playable guess who might be dead, too.
[06:39.850 --> 06:41.230]  It is an actual game.
[06:41.590 --> 06:42.390]  You can play it.
[06:42.950 --> 06:43.950]  I source movies.
[06:44.050 --> 06:45.770]  I had some friends source scenes for movies.
[06:45.930 --> 06:46.710]  He source movies.
[06:46.790 --> 06:49.510]  We have like 50 or so movies at this point.
[06:49.990 --> 06:51.570]  Let me know if you need a password to get in.
[06:51.670 --> 06:52.250]  I need one.
[06:52.710 --> 06:54.150]  So I will. Yeah, I will.
[06:54.310 --> 06:58.010]  I'll put the password in the chat so you guys can open this up and see it.
[06:58.070 --> 06:59.710]  We're going to play live on the podcast.
[06:59.850 --> 07:02.190]  You can absolutely play live if you would like to.
[07:03.610 --> 07:06.330]  The one people are listening, maybe we'll put a link to this game
[07:06.330 --> 07:08.530]  in the description of the shows that people could easily find it
[07:08.530 --> 07:10.230]  and they will not need a password at this time.
[07:10.290 --> 07:13.630]  I was just trying to keep it hidden so it didn't somehow leak to you guys.
[07:13.950 --> 07:15.110]  But it is a full game.
[07:15.290 --> 07:16.370]  It is a playable game.
[07:16.370 --> 07:19.590]  And so just for context of how this game specifically works,
[07:19.770 --> 07:22.530]  it is the moment in which is being displayed.
[07:22.930 --> 07:27.750]  It's if the character dies in the movie later, but lives in that moment,
[07:27.750 --> 07:29.670]  it will be lives, even though they may die later.
[07:29.810 --> 07:34.210]  So it's specifically the context of the scene that is being displayed.
[07:34.550 --> 07:36.850]  So should we play now? Yeah, absolutely.
[07:37.410 --> 07:38.670]  Oh, my God.
[07:39.470 --> 07:40.550]  OK, let's see.
[07:41.330 --> 07:44.650]  So you click play and it tells you the movie
[07:44.650 --> 07:46.570]  as well as the year it released.
[07:48.650 --> 07:50.130]  Is it the same for everyone?
[07:50.290 --> 07:51.830]  Is it random? No, no, it's random.
[07:51.990 --> 07:54.030]  It's a randomly cycling thing of images.
[07:54.410 --> 07:56.110]  Can I tell you the first one I got?
[07:56.230 --> 07:57.630]  I would love to hear your first one.
[07:58.070 --> 08:00.330]  It was the younglings in Star Wars.
[08:00.410 --> 08:01.170]  That's a great one.
[08:01.850 --> 08:02.850]  I wish I could take.
[08:03.070 --> 08:04.690]  I wish I could take credit for that one.
[08:04.730 --> 08:07.370]  That was the the wonderful person who made the game.
[08:07.810 --> 08:09.850]  I had to turn off the game because the music was too loud.
[08:09.930 --> 08:11.790]  But I can't wait to play that later.
[08:12.230 --> 08:12.890]  It's fantastic.
[08:12.890 --> 08:14.370]  Oh, my God.
[08:15.270 --> 08:17.330]  Samuel Jackson in Deep Blue Sea.
[08:17.610 --> 08:19.070]  I think he lives.
[08:20.270 --> 08:21.790]  Oh, he does not play.
[08:22.010 --> 08:25.070]  No, it's it's like one of the most iconic death scenes of all.
[08:25.270 --> 08:28.710]  Live, die, live gremlins.
[08:28.850 --> 08:30.030]  Oh, Billy lives, of course.
[08:30.710 --> 08:31.710]  Oh, no. The younglings.
[08:33.290 --> 08:37.490]  The other guys, Sam Jackson and the Independence Day.
[08:38.910 --> 08:40.930]  Oh, oh, I guess he does die.
[08:41.410 --> 08:42.390]  Dude, that's awesome.
[08:42.390 --> 08:43.550]  Yeah, it's great.
[08:43.750 --> 08:45.870]  It's a great way to go.
[08:46.030 --> 08:47.190]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[08:47.570 --> 08:49.190]  And he does the whole thing.
[08:49.250 --> 08:49.870]  And it's a great scene.
[08:50.090 --> 08:50.730]  I love that movie.
[08:51.090 --> 08:51.970]  Oh, my God.
[08:52.190 --> 08:53.850]  So that that was one of my I.
[08:54.170 --> 08:57.730]  As soon as you texted me that, Gavin, I immediately thought,
[08:57.810 --> 08:58.770]  well, can I make this a game?
[08:58.810 --> 08:59.790]  I don't know how to make games.
[08:59.890 --> 09:01.630]  And I reached out to him and he loved it.
[09:01.670 --> 09:03.390]  And he put that together so quickly.
[09:03.390 --> 09:06.870]  And over the like the last week, we've been just adding more movies to it.
[09:06.970 --> 09:10.470]  And I'm excited to see people play it and react to it.
[09:10.470 --> 09:11.730]  So it's great.
[09:12.010 --> 09:15.850]  What's crazy to me is given our day job and our association
[09:15.850 --> 09:17.970]  with the gaming industry, right?
[09:19.730 --> 09:21.310]  I had kind of.
[09:21.870 --> 09:22.630]  Dog's coughing.
[09:23.290 --> 09:27.830]  I had kind of had an unofficial thought in my head that like a rule in my head
[09:27.830 --> 09:31.150]  that one of the things we would never be, we might be a Bovril podcast for a while.
[09:31.230 --> 09:35.590]  We might be a fruit podcast, certainly an Apple podcast, maybe not a banana podcast.
[09:35.730 --> 09:37.430]  Definitely. We're a baseball podcast on occasion.
[09:38.510 --> 09:40.970]  We're certainly a beefy podcast.
[09:41.410 --> 09:47.070]  I never wanted to be a gaming podcast, but we might be a little bit in a way
[09:47.070 --> 09:50.010]  that I did not anticipate, which is we're a game creating.
[09:51.430 --> 09:54.030]  Well, I guess. Yeah, I love this direction.
[09:54.750 --> 09:55.770]  Not to give us any.
[09:55.850 --> 09:58.650]  We're like the Steve Jobs, but like way less talented.
[09:58.990 --> 10:00.390]  Like we give the direction.
[10:00.650 --> 10:01.830]  We have none of the skills.
[10:01.830 --> 10:03.090]  We can't take any of the credit.
[10:03.090 --> 10:08.490]  We're just we we are just the turtleneck portion.
[10:08.650 --> 10:10.250]  Yes, exactly. Jobs.
[10:10.310 --> 10:11.550]  Not even the full shirt.
[10:11.610 --> 10:15.150]  We're just the annoying part that goes on the neck that keeps it warmer
[10:15.150 --> 10:18.450]  than a neck needs to be in a climate controlled environment.
[10:18.810 --> 10:20.390]  But here we are. That's us.
[10:20.510 --> 10:24.570]  We're providing useless warmth while more talented people create the games.
[10:25.970 --> 10:27.030]  Absolutely. Yeah.
[10:27.290 --> 10:29.910]  And I don't know, it's funny that you don't you didn't think of us
[10:29.910 --> 10:32.910]  as ever being a gaming podcast, not in a traditional sense,
[10:32.910 --> 10:35.630]  but games is just such a big part of at least my life.
[10:35.970 --> 10:37.010]  Yeah, I guess so.
[10:37.730 --> 10:38.890]  They don't come up as much.
[10:38.970 --> 10:40.030]  You're gems, a war guy.
[10:40.190 --> 10:41.290]  Come on. Are you?
[10:41.430 --> 10:42.870]  At least you used to be. I'm assuming.
[10:43.150 --> 10:43.830]  Yeah, no, no.
[10:43.910 --> 10:46.870]  I'm still a gems, a war guy, but I'm certainly not talking about it on the podcast.
[10:48.190 --> 10:49.970]  Can you imagine a gems, a war podcast?
[10:50.170 --> 10:51.330]  Every week? I cannot.
[10:51.770 --> 10:55.630]  It would be it would be I don't know who would be more torturous
[10:55.630 --> 10:59.090]  for the three people to listen to it or the person who has to do it.
[11:00.350 --> 11:00.990]  Oh, man.
[11:01.470 --> 11:03.010]  That'll be when I hit rock bottom.
[11:03.290 --> 11:04.570]  I'll do a gems, a war podcast.
[11:04.790 --> 11:07.250]  Yeah. Yeah, I'm excited.
[11:08.590 --> 11:10.270]  I don't even know what that would look like.
[11:10.550 --> 11:11.130]  I don't know. Yeah.
[11:11.150 --> 11:14.550]  I wonder how long you could talk for before you would just have nothing to say.
[11:14.870 --> 11:19.830]  Well, I'll tell you what, I, I, I rarely listen to this podcast,
[11:20.010 --> 11:24.510]  but I listen to myself talk ad nauseum without taking a breath
[11:24.510 --> 11:27.170]  for the first 14 fucking minutes of last episode,
[11:27.290 --> 11:29.650]  just talking about baseballs in a store issue.
[11:29.650 --> 11:31.450]  So I could probably go for a while.
[11:32.730 --> 11:33.850]  I had to have Nick.
[11:34.190 --> 11:35.090]  I said 14.
[11:35.230 --> 11:38.330]  You guys only had to listen to 11 minutes because I made Nick cut it down.
[11:38.490 --> 11:40.110]  No, I wish it would have been even more.
[11:40.250 --> 11:42.030]  Are you talking to the audience to the audience?
[11:42.150 --> 11:42.410]  Yeah. Yeah.
[11:42.410 --> 11:44.790]  I listened to the pre the pre Dennis version.
[11:45.330 --> 11:46.050]  Jesus Christ.
[11:46.050 --> 11:49.370]  So I could probably talk about gems, a war for a couple of days.
[11:52.070 --> 11:52.630]  Oh, man.
[11:52.710 --> 11:56.590]  Speaking of talking about stuff, I what?
[11:57.630 --> 11:58.690]  Let's do a segway.
[11:59.070 --> 12:00.910]  Yeah, that's a great segway.
[12:01.130 --> 12:02.850]  Speaking of talking about stuff, I,
[12:03.670 --> 12:07.250]  I have not had a lot prepared for this podcast for the last few weeks
[12:07.790 --> 12:10.310]  outside of the tattoo, which was kind of a visual gag.
[12:10.650 --> 12:12.210]  And I've been feeling kind of bad about it.
[12:12.230 --> 12:15.890]  And whenever that happens, typically I go and I'll just devote like a day
[12:15.890 --> 12:19.050]  or two days to just like brainstorming and trying to come up with shit.
[12:20.130 --> 12:23.590]  But I've been so busy with other creative work
[12:23.590 --> 12:25.150]  the last couple of weeks for the company,
[12:25.930 --> 12:29.370]  pitching some shows to the Achievement Hunter guys and some other stuff going on.
[12:29.930 --> 12:33.030]  And I just haven't been able to to devote the time to it.
[12:33.410 --> 12:38.050]  And so I realized after I after lunch today, after I ran some errands,
[12:38.070 --> 12:40.990]  I was like, Oh, shit, I've got to do a podcast with these guys in two weeks,
[12:41.130 --> 12:44.770]  in two hours, and I haven't really contributed to anything in two weeks.
[12:44.890 --> 12:46.950]  I better get my shit together. What do I do?
[12:47.330 --> 12:48.770]  So I thought, I'm going to get on my bicycle.
[12:48.890 --> 12:49.790]  That's where I have my best ideas.
[12:49.810 --> 12:50.990]  And I'm just going to ride around
[12:50.990 --> 12:53.590]  and I'm just going to come up with ideas on my bicycle
[12:54.190 --> 12:56.310]  and then I'll have a bunch of ideas.
[12:56.790 --> 12:57.910]  And so I did that.
[12:58.090 --> 13:01.490]  And so I have on my phone a bunch of notes of thoughts
[13:01.490 --> 13:05.610]  I had while riding my bicycle, trying to come up with ideas for this podcast today.
[13:05.610 --> 13:07.790]  If you guys want to hear my thoughts.
[13:08.190 --> 13:08.770]  How many thoughts did you have?
[13:09.210 --> 13:11.410]  Let me hold on. Let me get looking up here.
[13:11.850 --> 13:12.970]  How long did you ride?
[13:13.310 --> 13:14.370]  I rode for one hour.
[13:14.610 --> 13:17.570]  OK, so about 10.9 miles is what I rode.
[13:17.850 --> 13:20.190]  I bet you had six thoughts.
[13:20.190 --> 13:21.330]  I was thinking the same.
[13:21.690 --> 13:23.090]  I had six thoughts.
[13:23.430 --> 13:24.370]  I thought every 10 minutes.
[13:24.470 --> 13:25.670]  Yeah, it's a good average. Yeah.
[13:25.670 --> 13:26.830]  Yeah. First thought.
[13:27.590 --> 13:30.030]  Wouldn't it be fun if we all had a contest
[13:30.610 --> 13:32.670]  to see if we could work out one muscle
[13:33.170 --> 13:36.850]  and then see if you could get inordinately big in that like one,
[13:36.950 --> 13:40.050]  like your right calf or like your left bicep?
[13:40.170 --> 13:43.470]  Kind of like that character in that, what, Lady in the Water movie
[13:43.470 --> 13:47.130]  who had the big one, one big strong arm or like all the German people
[13:47.130 --> 13:50.530]  who do arm wrestling that only work out their their one arm.
[13:51.390 --> 13:53.930]  Yeah. Oh, like a charger from Left 4 Dead.
[13:54.050 --> 13:56.310]  Yeah. Back to gaming. Yeah, that's a great example.
[13:57.130 --> 13:58.330]  But it doesn't have to be an arm.
[13:58.710 --> 14:00.250]  One ab. Yeah.
[14:00.310 --> 14:01.330]  Like, could you do an ab?
[14:01.530 --> 14:04.590]  Could you do like, I just want to have the world's strongest neck.
[14:05.110 --> 14:08.110]  You know, I'm just going to do neck exercises or like
[14:08.110 --> 14:12.590]  I want a big, juicy booty, but everything else looks exactly as it does now.
[14:12.650 --> 14:14.090]  So I'm just going to do squats.
[14:14.090 --> 14:18.990]  And so I was thinking, yeah, Andrew should absolutely do ankle exercises.
[14:19.170 --> 14:21.590]  Like you should have you should have like
[14:21.590 --> 14:23.770]  you should have like Arnold Schwarzenegger ankles.
[14:23.990 --> 14:26.090]  I am going a different direction with it.
[14:26.170 --> 14:28.790]  I would love to have an absurdly strong pinky,
[14:29.490 --> 14:31.330]  just something that doesn't need to be.
[14:31.410 --> 14:32.730]  But I get like it's a weird.
[14:33.230 --> 14:36.030]  It'd be a weird flex if the pinky was jacked.
[14:36.090 --> 14:38.410]  I don't think I've ever seen a jacked finger before.
[14:38.630 --> 14:39.950]  I don't know if that's even possible.
[14:40.430 --> 14:43.930]  I'm sure if you worked at it hard enough, you could jack your finger pretty hard.
[14:44.090 --> 14:47.050]  Isn't it mostly tendons, though, instead of your box?
[14:47.170 --> 14:48.410]  It's got to be what's.
[14:48.850 --> 14:52.610]  How much do you think I could lift with just my my pinky currently?
[14:54.050 --> 14:57.390]  Well, I think you should test the force that it would take to pull it out
[14:57.390 --> 14:59.890]  of the socket and then slightly less than that.
[15:00.230 --> 15:01.550]  How do I test that?
[15:01.950 --> 15:02.690]  I don't know.
[15:03.690 --> 15:06.990]  Huh? Well, I'll do it on your off pinky because you might not be able
[15:06.990 --> 15:07.690]  to use it anymore.
[15:08.150 --> 15:09.230]  You don't want to do that to a good pinky.
[15:09.290 --> 15:11.130]  I don't think I need my pinky, really.
[15:11.390 --> 15:13.730]  I think the pinky is an overrated finger.
[15:13.730 --> 15:15.510]  I don't think it's rated that highly.
[15:15.730 --> 15:17.490]  You think a pinky is superfluous?
[15:17.990 --> 15:19.990]  What are you going to balance your phone on without a pinky?
[15:21.030 --> 15:22.110]  You would work rent.
[15:22.210 --> 15:26.410]  Let's say, OK, if there was like an NFL draft, what about when you drink tea?
[15:27.950 --> 15:29.410]  Yeah, I hate them.
[15:29.610 --> 15:31.590]  My pinky always goes up and I hate it.
[15:31.690 --> 15:32.670]  I hate it. It just it happens.
[15:32.970 --> 15:35.790]  I hate that it always I have to catch myself drinking glass of water.
[15:35.890 --> 15:37.190]  Pinky up just always happens.
[15:37.450 --> 15:39.510]  So I'd be OK if I lost my pinkies.
[15:39.850 --> 15:43.470]  I think if there was like an NFL style draft, seven rounds
[15:43.730 --> 15:45.890]  and people picked body parts.
[15:46.310 --> 15:49.710]  I think the pinky is like the punter of the body.
[15:50.070 --> 15:51.430]  Like it's a seventh round pick.
[15:52.230 --> 15:55.590]  It's you probably need to pick that before you'd like pick your appendix
[15:55.590 --> 15:56.310]  before your pinky.
[15:56.550 --> 15:58.310]  Oh, 100 percent. Absolutely.
[15:59.010 --> 16:01.610]  I don't fully understand what my appendix does.
[16:01.870 --> 16:04.170]  I know what my pinky is capable of doing.
[16:04.490 --> 16:05.570]  I don't think I need it.
[16:05.910 --> 16:06.630]  Your appendix.
[16:07.090 --> 16:11.250]  There's there's like a 40 percent chance that at some point in your life,
[16:11.290 --> 16:12.790]  your appendix will try to kill. Yes.
[16:12.790 --> 16:14.770]  Your pinky will never harm you.
[16:15.290 --> 16:18.610]  Whatever I've spent most of my life, whenever I'd hear the term appendix
[16:18.610 --> 16:21.690]  bursting in my head, it was always like a chest burster
[16:21.690 --> 16:23.770]  that like it would explode like a grenade.
[16:24.310 --> 16:26.150]  Yeah, I assume that that's correct.
[16:26.570 --> 16:27.350]  I don't think it is.
[16:27.610 --> 16:28.850]  Have you ever had your appendix out?
[16:29.030 --> 16:32.450]  I have not. But in turn, like I'm saying visually in my head,
[16:32.450 --> 16:35.010]  it was like skin exploding there.
[16:35.070 --> 16:36.210]  It could be, Andrew.
[16:36.390 --> 16:37.210]  Here's the problem.
[16:37.490 --> 16:40.670]  When everybody's tummy hurts, they go to the doctor and they get their appendix
[16:40.670 --> 16:43.370]  removed. You never hear about people whose appendix explode
[16:43.370 --> 16:47.430]  because they put the pin in the grenade before before the detonation.
[16:47.830 --> 16:53.110]  But for all we know, that could be that could be why it's such a big
[16:53.110 --> 16:55.490]  goddamn deal to get somebody to the hospital.
[16:55.530 --> 16:58.390]  Because what if it's like it's so dangerous
[16:58.390 --> 17:02.270]  that if you were in the proximity of somebody's tummy, you could get shrapnel.
[17:03.910 --> 17:07.070]  Like we might have a whole like it might be a whole thing
[17:07.070 --> 17:11.550]  because it's so goddamn dangerous that people take it so seriously.
[17:12.070 --> 17:15.710]  There's a scene in Ambulance involving a spleen that you'd probably enjoy.
[17:15.730 --> 17:17.350]  I need to see it. It's on streaming now.
[17:17.530 --> 17:18.670]  I need to. Is it really?
[17:19.110 --> 17:21.230]  Yeah, it's already like you can pay to rent it.
[17:21.310 --> 17:21.890]  I need to do that.
[17:22.590 --> 17:26.050]  I really think I like I was thinking what else I don't respect.
[17:26.230 --> 17:27.990]  Wisdom teeth probably don't need.
[17:28.050 --> 17:29.670]  But I view those as like spare tires.
[17:30.130 --> 17:32.910]  So I guess I'd take I would take those over the pinky.
[17:33.730 --> 17:36.350]  I really think the pinky would be the last thing I would take.
[17:36.350 --> 17:40.850]  You would rather remove something you only have 10 of than something you have 32 of.
[17:41.690 --> 17:43.510]  Yeah, because I just don't.
[17:43.650 --> 17:47.330]  Maybe, you know, maybe I will try a week where I don't use my my pinkies at all
[17:47.330 --> 17:48.610]  and just see what that's like.
[17:48.610 --> 17:50.050]  Yeah, yeah. Maybe I'm greatly.
[17:50.370 --> 17:52.170]  I'm not respecting the pinky potential.
[17:52.630 --> 17:54.070]  Shopping from the end caps as well.
[17:54.130 --> 17:57.030]  Yeah, no, no, no pinky end cap week.
[17:57.470 --> 17:59.270]  OK, I can do that.
[18:00.690 --> 18:02.750]  Here here's my second idea.
[18:02.750 --> 18:03.350]  Oh, I forgot.
[18:03.550 --> 18:08.030]  So I was I was I was writing down, you know, mostly through neighborhoods,
[18:08.110 --> 18:09.750]  but I was looking for stuff to be inspired by.
[18:09.870 --> 18:13.210]  But pretty much all I saw was was, well, you'll see pretty much
[18:13.210 --> 18:14.490]  all I saw was houses and shit, right?
[18:14.510 --> 18:18.450]  So I got to thinking about reality TV and where we would make our
[18:18.450 --> 18:20.490]  the best impact as a reality TV show.
[18:20.590 --> 18:21.590]  And then it hit me.
[18:21.650 --> 18:23.510]  We should flip houses together.
[18:24.910 --> 18:27.170]  Like, what if we were the property brothers?
[18:27.550 --> 18:31.710]  OK, or the or the who the flipper flops or like I'm Christine on the coast
[18:31.710 --> 18:33.830]  and you're her ex-husband or whatever.
[18:35.690 --> 18:39.990]  I mean, we I would like to see us with the tool belts doing some damage,
[18:40.190 --> 18:43.230]  fixing some shit up, making some dreams come true.
[18:43.590 --> 18:44.730]  That was all that was.
[18:44.910 --> 18:48.270]  I would like to build because Andrew seems to bend his life
[18:48.270 --> 18:50.030]  to fit him as much as possible.
[18:50.030 --> 18:52.850]  Like putting Keurigs in the bedroom and, you know, putting cereal
[18:52.850 --> 18:53.990]  in the toilet or whatever you do.
[18:54.230 --> 18:57.070]  What I would love to build a house from scratch
[18:57.070 --> 18:59.430]  that is exactly to your specification.
[18:59.430 --> 19:04.210]  Yes. It'd be sort of like that, like Andrew's version of the house of the future.
[19:04.710 --> 19:07.690]  Like you would see like in the 40s and the 50s, they would build those model homes
[19:07.690 --> 19:10.770]  with all the like like near future technology
[19:10.770 --> 19:12.430]  that was going to make your life so much easier.
[19:12.550 --> 19:15.370]  And it was all like I would love to see that.
[19:15.570 --> 19:19.410]  Like if Andrew designed a home from the ground up to be the perfect future
[19:19.410 --> 19:20.570]  proof Andrew home.
[19:20.970 --> 19:24.350]  It's so funny you say that because I had this thought literally the other day
[19:24.350 --> 19:27.190]  where I was wishing that there was something I think it was.
[19:27.190 --> 19:28.150]  I don't even remember what it was.
[19:28.230 --> 19:29.510]  May have been my washing machine.
[19:29.690 --> 19:33.070]  I was like, ah, why do I have to go to a different room just for that?
[19:33.150 --> 19:34.150]  Like that would be so handy.
[19:34.190 --> 19:35.310]  It should be in my closet.
[19:35.570 --> 19:39.450]  So like when I change clothes, I immediately just put the old clothes in
[19:39.450 --> 19:40.690]  to be washed.
[19:41.150 --> 19:45.450]  And then I realized that if I built things under that that that vision,
[19:45.610 --> 19:48.450]  I would have an entire empty space of nothing.
[19:48.910 --> 19:50.810]  Everything would be in one space.
[19:50.810 --> 19:53.850]  And then the rest of the entire house would just be empty.
[19:53.970 --> 19:54.950]  That's a shit house.
[19:55.310 --> 19:56.490]  I think it's a terrible idea.
[19:56.490 --> 19:58.290]  I don't even think my vision is good.
[19:58.410 --> 20:00.430]  Like that would I would not I would be miserable.
[20:00.850 --> 20:02.530]  I just have so much wasted space.
[20:02.970 --> 20:03.790]  I thought something similar.
[20:03.930 --> 20:06.370]  I was like, why aren't all kitchen cabinets dishwashers?
[20:06.670 --> 20:08.530]  Like you could just move shit between them.
[20:10.150 --> 20:13.810]  Yeah, it's funny you say that because another part I can't take credit for this.
[20:13.930 --> 20:16.970]  This is from another comedy podcast that I heard months and months ago,
[20:17.070 --> 20:18.390]  but it's been sticking in my head the whole time.
[20:18.710 --> 20:20.550]  Somebody said, why not have two dishwashers?
[20:20.870 --> 20:21.850]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[20:21.890 --> 20:23.990]  Some people do that and they just move stuff from one to the other.
[20:24.450 --> 20:25.610]  Yeah, you just move stuff from one to the other.
[20:25.610 --> 20:28.730]  And then you never it's it's a perfect cycle, right?
[20:28.730 --> 20:29.630]  It makes so much sense.
[20:29.750 --> 20:30.750]  We should absolutely.
[20:30.950 --> 20:32.150]  I wish I wish I had to.
[20:32.650 --> 20:35.130]  That's a pretty pricey way to not use kitchen cabinets.
[20:35.510 --> 20:36.290]  Pretty pricey.
[20:36.370 --> 20:37.850]  And then also a waste of cabinets.
[20:38.350 --> 20:40.210]  I didn't. This is the problem.
[20:40.290 --> 20:43.970]  If you and I design houses, it's funny because I just it was right
[20:43.970 --> 20:46.590]  before we we recorded, I put this in my notes.
[20:46.790 --> 20:47.910]  I had this for a while.
[20:49.130 --> 20:50.910]  This is a friend of mine's door.
[20:51.430 --> 20:54.110]  And I was going to ask you, Gavin, if this is like an overseas thing
[20:54.110 --> 20:56.730]  or if this is just like if we made a house.
[20:56.850 --> 20:57.410]  So this worked.
[20:57.790 --> 20:58.910]  Look at these doors.
[20:59.630 --> 21:02.650]  One is way too large and the other one is too big.
[21:02.670 --> 21:03.990]  And it just makes me uncomfortable.
[21:04.730 --> 21:05.990]  Why is the handles?
[21:06.230 --> 21:08.030]  Why is the handle 80 percent up the door?
[21:08.290 --> 21:09.370]  I don't know.
[21:09.570 --> 21:11.110]  It's a chest level.
[21:12.350 --> 21:13.230]  I don't like this.
[21:13.330 --> 21:14.250]  That's so high up.
[21:14.250 --> 21:15.670]  Like it's a long door.
[21:15.770 --> 21:18.330]  I feel like that is no sense of scale.
[21:18.450 --> 21:20.010]  Like that looks like a really tall.
[21:20.210 --> 21:21.570]  What is that like an Australian plug?
[21:21.670 --> 21:22.290]  Where is this?
[21:22.590 --> 21:23.490]  What's going on in New Zealand?
[21:23.490 --> 21:24.930]  It's a New Zealand home.
[21:26.410 --> 21:27.910]  But I just I didn't know.
[21:28.470 --> 21:30.850]  What's in the little demon cubby up top?
[21:31.330 --> 21:32.850]  It just goes to the top of the house.
[21:32.930 --> 21:36.550]  There's no there's no like it's just the the construction of it.
[21:36.650 --> 21:37.550]  It's like wooden shit.
[21:37.870 --> 21:40.330]  It's like a crawl space, but not at all developed.
[21:40.770 --> 21:41.590]  That I don't know why that.
[21:41.730 --> 21:43.310]  That's where the Babadook lives.
[21:43.730 --> 21:45.090]  It does. That's what I felt.
[21:45.150 --> 21:46.590]  I felt like it was a demon door.
[21:47.010 --> 21:49.290]  But also it's just the other doors way too long.
[21:49.330 --> 21:50.390]  Like, I feel like that would be us.
[21:50.430 --> 21:51.670]  We just don't know how to measure things.
[21:51.970 --> 21:52.590]  I love this.
[21:52.590 --> 21:56.610]  That would be this is the perfect location for a Jackie Chan chase to end up
[21:56.610 --> 22:00.710]  because, you know, he would come flying through the bottom one
[22:00.710 --> 22:03.170]  and he'd flip around and go straight through the top one and close it.
[22:03.770 --> 22:05.730]  And the people behind him would be like, where'd he go?
[22:06.230 --> 22:10.750]  Oh, he would grab the top of it and like swing in with his legs.
[22:10.870 --> 22:11.610]  Like he'd kick out.
[22:11.750 --> 22:13.130]  Like I could see it so clearly.
[22:13.390 --> 22:14.390]  That's perfect.
[22:14.730 --> 22:16.230]  That is a Jackie Chan door.
[22:17.410 --> 22:20.970]  Do you think Jackie Chan just has those size doors in his home to escape?
[22:23.670 --> 22:26.330]  Gets into an argument with someone, there's no following him.
[22:26.530 --> 22:30.030]  I couldn't if you were a storm chaser like me, you could not.
[22:30.150 --> 22:32.550]  I could not pursue Jackie Chan if he had doors like that.
[22:32.550 --> 22:34.570]  Oh, God, there's no way it'd be preventative.
[22:34.930 --> 22:36.190]  Well, you got to go get a stepladder.
[22:37.510 --> 22:41.770]  His house must be a labyrinth of like ladders and slides.
[22:43.110 --> 22:45.190]  Like that Winchester fireman poles.
[22:45.330 --> 22:46.430]  Yeah, it's like that's.
[22:51.070 --> 22:52.570]  Oh, oh, that's good.
[22:52.570 --> 23:05.310]  I think if I was to build your house, Andrew, my first modification to like making it not like a normal house is that the floor of the bedroom would be a lift and you'd be able to descend or.
[23:06.470 --> 23:06.870]  Yes.
[23:07.050 --> 23:09.130]  You'd be able to go to any floor via the bed.
[23:09.370 --> 23:10.410]  If you want to wake up in the kitchen.
[23:10.490 --> 23:10.710]  He lives in the elevator.
[23:11.350 --> 23:14.350]  Yes, the bed is the elevator.
[23:14.610 --> 23:14.790]  Yeah.
[23:14.910 --> 23:15.370]  That's amazing.
[23:15.370 --> 23:21.910]  And your alarm could be like it just drops a little, scares the shit out of you, wakes you up and then you go into the kitchen, you lead over.
[23:21.910 --> 23:24.950]  You've got your, you've got your noodles or whatever, your chow mein.
[23:28.870 --> 23:37.330]  I love the idea of there being a two, one story house, like you think it's a one story house and literally an entire floor elevates to make it a two story house.
[23:39.610 --> 23:45.150]  And then you're just down in the kitchen and people are like, why is there this big open square where there's nothing inside?
[23:45.230 --> 23:46.470]  And you're like, don't worry about it.
[23:46.710 --> 23:50.630]  I want, I want a house like the building in control.
[23:50.630 --> 23:53.070]  You know how like rooms are constantly shifting?
[23:53.270 --> 23:54.390]  Like I just, that would be ideal.
[23:54.550 --> 23:55.270]  That'd be fun.
[23:55.850 --> 23:57.710]  My bedroom is in the front of the home suddenly.
[23:58.230 --> 23:59.670]  I don't know where my bathroom is.
[23:59.790 --> 24:00.730]  It's on a different level now.
[24:01.310 --> 24:01.990]  Constant shift.
[24:02.570 --> 24:03.170]  Oh Christ.
[24:03.250 --> 24:04.330]  So what's idea three, Geoff?
[24:04.790 --> 24:05.590]  Oh, sure.
[24:06.050 --> 24:10.450]  Uh, remember I was driving through neighborhoods looking at houses cause it was all that was around and I was trying to be safe.
[24:11.030 --> 24:14.950]  Uh, you guys, you guys know what I think must work really well?
[24:15.530 --> 24:16.330]  Political signs.
[24:16.730 --> 24:26.790]  You ever notice that you see political signs everywhere in people's yards at all out front, like, uh, at a, at like a busy intersection anywhere.
[24:26.970 --> 24:29.870]  There's a grass, a little plot plot of land.
[24:30.310 --> 24:31.570]  There's 400 political signs.
[24:31.570 --> 24:37.310]  And they say like, well, I saw one today that said, uh, vote for prop a, I have no idea if prop a is good or bad.
[24:37.350 --> 24:39.870]  I'm not keeping up right now, but that got me thinking.
[24:40.370 --> 24:41.970]  If we're trying to get the word out.
[24:41.970 --> 24:50.630]  What better way than we make political signs for face that are like vote for prop F yeah.
[24:50.630 --> 25:03.210]  It's like, and then people can put them in their yard all over America and they're like, you know, like when you drive by the church on like, uh, on, you know, voting on Tuesday morning and it's like all the vote here, vote a key signs.
[25:03.290 --> 25:11.870]  And there's all the different like props and, you know, vote for this person and all the, uh, you know, this person for mayor, this person for county commissioner, railroad commissioner, governor, whatever.
[25:11.870 --> 25:23.350]  And then there's just like a bunch of vote for prop prop F prop F people will be wondering around thinking, uh, realizing, well, I see a very strong correlation between people who want prop F and people who really don't want you to scrump.
[25:23.530 --> 25:28.250]  It seems to be, I wonder what's going to be prop F.
[25:28.310 --> 25:32.070]  It could be like a more stringent scrumping rules.
[25:32.250 --> 25:37.130]  Oh, you think that, or do you think it's like decriminalizing scrumping?
[25:39.230 --> 25:40.470]  Yeah, decriminalizing scrumping.
[25:40.850 --> 25:40.930]  Yeah.
[25:41.030 --> 25:42.790]  Apple, free apples, free people.
[25:43.130 --> 25:43.450]  Yeah.
[25:43.530 --> 25:44.050]  There you go.
[25:44.650 --> 25:47.930]  I always feel so dumb when I read free world vote.
[25:50.490 --> 25:50.890]  Yes.
[25:50.990 --> 25:58.990]  On prop F I always feel so stupid when I see something a lot and I don't know what it stands for or what it means like the prop a stuff.
[25:59.130 --> 26:06.350]  And for a while in Austin, there was, I saw so many signs that said, stop the PUD and I don't know what PUD is or what it, I don't know.
[26:07.790 --> 26:15.810]  It just always annoys me when I see an abbreviation or like an acronym so many times without ever being, I'm always too lazy to Google it.
[26:15.970 --> 26:18.810]  And I never figure out what it is just by thinking about it.
[26:18.810 --> 26:24.110]  Like, like the other day I was looking at some baseball stuff and I couldn't figure out what RBI stood for.
[26:24.290 --> 26:25.930]  And it was just annoying the shit out of me.
[26:25.990 --> 26:28.270]  I was like, why is that not obvious to me what that is?
[26:28.970 --> 26:33.370]  Runs batted in, RBI, it's how many points you scored like you personally.
[26:33.810 --> 26:35.770]  I didn't just say points because it called runs.
[26:36.610 --> 26:38.090]  No, I want to just say runs.
[26:38.330 --> 26:39.570]  Yeah, runs batted in.
[26:39.930 --> 26:47.910]  Like how many run like, like, like if I if you're on first base and I and I'm batting, we're on the same team and I hit a home run, then I just got two RBIs.
[26:48.090 --> 26:51.850]  I got two runs batted in and they count against the pitcher and they count for us.
[26:52.330 --> 26:54.270]  Okay, I didn't know how that worked.
[26:54.370 --> 26:55.070]  That makes sense.
[26:55.910 --> 27:05.450]  Yeah, so does the person so it's like a stat against pitchers then not what's a stat against pitchers and it's a stat for well, I'm on first base.
[27:05.450 --> 27:06.750]  Do I get anything for that?
[27:07.110 --> 27:08.410]  Yeah, you get a run scored.
[27:08.530 --> 27:09.470]  You get a run scored.
[27:09.610 --> 27:10.470]  Okay, I got it.
[27:10.490 --> 27:13.910]  But I don't get an RBI because I wasn't I didn't you didn't bat the run in.
[27:14.090 --> 27:14.770]  You just you scored.
[27:14.990 --> 27:18.850]  Yeah, so it counts the run scored and then RBI, two RBIs for the batter.
[27:19.210 --> 27:22.430]  So why if you're on first, why wouldn't it be called RRI?
[27:22.890 --> 27:23.550]  Runs run in.
[27:23.910 --> 27:24.510]  Runs run in.
[27:25.030 --> 27:25.870]  Runs ran in.
[27:27.810 --> 27:30.310]  Well, let's petition for for that change to be made.
[27:30.590 --> 27:31.390]  That'd be a prop F.
[27:31.610 --> 27:32.450]  That'd be a prop F.
[27:32.450 --> 27:36.350]  That's that's the that's the prop F subsection 1A.
[27:36.490 --> 27:41.330]  Yeah, we add to change it to runs ran in.
[27:41.430 --> 27:41.730]  Yeah.
[27:41.810 --> 27:47.830]  What's the name of that symbol you always see in legal stuff like the squiggly like S with a circle in the middle of it?
[27:48.050 --> 27:50.270]  Squiggly S with a circle in it.
[27:50.330 --> 27:54.130]  I immediately thought to like the logo of the young and the restless when you said that.
[27:54.210 --> 27:57.270]  I know that's not accurate, but squiggly like thing.
[27:57.670 --> 27:59.190]  That's where my brain immediately went.
[27:59.250 --> 28:00.490]  I have no idea what you're talking about.
[28:02.170 --> 28:02.930]  Oh, man.
[28:03.210 --> 28:03.550]  Post it.
[28:03.950 --> 28:05.710]  Is that just a Y and an R?
[28:05.870 --> 28:07.490]  The squiggly young and restless thing?
[28:07.650 --> 28:09.810]  That's the thing that like I I can see in my head.
[28:09.850 --> 28:10.510]  I don't know what that is.
[28:10.550 --> 28:11.390]  I don't think that's a character.
[28:12.090 --> 28:13.550]  You guys know what I'm talking about?
[28:14.390 --> 28:14.670]  No.
[28:15.430 --> 28:16.710]  Young and restless squiggly.
[28:20.090 --> 28:23.330]  This is not where I thought political signs would take us.
[28:23.890 --> 28:24.550]  This is here.
[28:24.670 --> 28:25.390]  I'll just post this.
[28:25.470 --> 28:29.010]  This is absolutely what I was thinking of when you said the it is just a Y and an R.
[28:29.010 --> 28:33.890]  I've never really paid attention to what it is, but it's just a bunch of squiggly lines in my head.
[28:34.210 --> 28:35.550]  Yeah, it's the young and the YR.
[28:35.730 --> 28:36.630]  Yeah, it's the YR.
[28:37.190 --> 28:38.370]  Yeah, it's a bunch of squiggly.
[28:38.830 --> 28:40.310]  I don't think that's a court document.
[28:40.750 --> 28:43.410]  I looked up my squiggle and it means section.
[28:44.670 --> 28:45.030]  Section.
[28:45.370 --> 28:47.890]  OK, can you show what the squiggle looks like?
[28:48.150 --> 28:50.270]  Can I see what the squiggle is?
[28:50.330 --> 28:51.490]  I don't think I even know.
[28:51.570 --> 28:52.150]  It's above yours.
[28:52.510 --> 28:52.890]  What do you mean?
[28:53.230 --> 28:55.310]  Yeah, he put he texted it.
[28:55.350 --> 28:56.270]  It's in the Discord chat.
[28:56.810 --> 28:58.230]  Oh, I didn't even see that.
[28:58.230 --> 29:00.150]  I've never seen that in my life.
[29:00.270 --> 29:01.870]  Oh, we should make what is it called again?
[29:01.990 --> 29:04.050]  Section. We should make section shirts.
[29:05.650 --> 29:07.290]  You should all get section tattoos.
[29:11.970 --> 29:14.170]  This podcast is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[29:14.450 --> 29:17.810]  Life can be overwhelming and many people are burned out without even knowing it.
[29:18.150 --> 29:20.930]  Symptoms can include lack of motivation, feeling helpless or trapped,
[29:21.270 --> 29:22.950]  detachment, fatigue and more.
[29:23.190 --> 29:27.110]  I know with my burnout, it's typically feelings of being very detached
[29:27.110 --> 29:31.110]  and overwhelmed and just a general struggle to accomplish tasks
[29:31.110 --> 29:35.190]  that typically aren't that difficult for me or just feeling pressure
[29:35.190 --> 29:37.770]  for not being able to do things that I'd like to do.
[29:37.890 --> 29:41.150]  But I just am so maxed out that I have to kind of disconnect
[29:41.150 --> 29:43.770]  from a lot of things that I may not necessarily want to.
[29:43.990 --> 29:47.150]  We associate burnout with work, but that's not the only cause.
[29:47.270 --> 29:49.590]  Any of our roles in life can lead us to feeling burnt out.

[29:57.630 --> 30:00.410]  Therapy is something that has been super helpful to me.
[30:00.630 --> 30:04.270]  Being able to talk with somebody about things that are stressing me out
[30:04.270 --> 30:07.030]  or just challenges that I'm facing at that time.
[30:07.130 --> 30:11.450]  Sometimes it can uncover things that I didn't realize were bothering me
[30:11.450 --> 30:12.390]  in the way that they were.
[30:12.990 --> 30:16.870]  And just being able to have those conversations in a safe environment

[32:21.390 --> 32:24.890]  If you're a current smoker who's struggling with quitting or past smoker
[32:24.890 --> 32:28.250]  who remembers what sucked about the process, you've got to check out Fume.

[32:41.450 --> 32:42.910]  studied to curb cravings.

[32:45.770 --> 32:49.890]  Notes to simulate menthol cigarettes and other flavors like cozy chai

[33:40.270 --> 33:43.250]  So what's what's the next next idea, Geoff?
[33:43.510 --> 33:47.870]  Oh, so, well, building off of that, and this isn't anything I saw.
[33:48.250 --> 33:49.490]  Well, I saw with my brain eye.
[33:50.510 --> 33:52.410]  So I guess internally I saw it.
[33:52.730 --> 33:55.270]  But that got me thinking about getting the word out about Prop F
[33:55.270 --> 33:57.590]  and just about creative ways to get the word out.
[33:57.850 --> 33:59.310]  And please remember, I was in a neighborhood
[33:59.310 --> 34:01.050]  while I was looking at warehouses and trees.
[34:01.190 --> 34:04.750]  And that got me thinking about trees and how we could use trees more to our benefit.
[34:04.870 --> 34:09.030]  And then that got me thinking about like 20 years ago in Germany
[34:09.030 --> 34:12.810]  when they realized that fucking Hitler, like in the 40s,
[34:12.810 --> 34:16.330]  planted a bunch of trees in a forest in a swastika pattern.
[34:16.750 --> 34:20.010]  So like 40 years later, when they bloomed and they came in in the fall,
[34:20.070 --> 34:22.790]  you see a bunch of swastikas in the landscape from aerial views.
[34:22.930 --> 34:26.010]  And that got me thinking what we should make.
[34:26.190 --> 34:29.710]  We should make giant Ian tree sculptures in forests
[34:29.710 --> 34:33.470]  that you can only see from above and you won't be able to see for 50 years.
[34:33.950 --> 34:36.030]  I need to vote against Prop F now.
[34:37.950 --> 34:40.950]  Probably less of the Nazi inspired aerial art.
[34:40.950 --> 34:42.690]  I don't. Why? No, I'm not.
[34:42.810 --> 34:45.250]  I don't know why you make that connection.
[34:45.470 --> 34:48.390]  You could have just explained it without tying it to Hitler.
[34:48.990 --> 34:52.250]  Why would why? Well, that's where that's where I got the idea.
[34:52.390 --> 34:54.550]  Well, I got the idea from Reddit, but that's where I saw it posted.
[34:54.970 --> 34:56.970]  You can't. We can't.
[34:56.990 --> 34:59.210]  Geoff, we can't do an idea that was from Hitler.
[34:59.610 --> 35:02.170]  We can't say inspired by with Hitler.
[35:02.730 --> 35:04.170]  It's terrible. I'm not saying it was.
[35:04.270 --> 35:05.370]  I know you're right about that.
[35:05.390 --> 35:07.770]  I don't want to say it just did.
[35:07.770 --> 35:11.790]  That's literally a musician plagiarizes another artist
[35:11.790 --> 35:15.510]  and then like retroactively gives the writing credit to the original.
[35:15.670 --> 35:18.390]  I don't I don't want to give any credit to Nazis.
[35:18.650 --> 35:23.930]  I just think it would be cool to make a tree to make some sort of a design
[35:24.690 --> 35:26.210]  in the trees that way.
[35:27.490 --> 35:29.750]  We can't do it. It is the idea.
[35:30.110 --> 35:31.230]  But we can't do it fine.
[35:31.450 --> 35:33.850]  If you didn't preface it with all the other stuff,
[35:34.670 --> 35:36.110]  Nazis are bad.
[35:36.110 --> 35:40.170]  I like we're nobody's saying they're not anti-Nazi.
[35:40.250 --> 35:42.110]  We're anti-Nazi on this podcast.
[35:42.490 --> 35:44.030]  And nobody's questioning that.
[35:44.310 --> 35:47.270]  Nobody's saying it's just why did you do that?
[35:47.750 --> 35:50.370]  Well, that's where the that's what but that's what made me think of it.
[35:50.530 --> 35:51.730]  It was like, oh, those assholes.
[35:52.310 --> 35:55.770]  They because they they used they used trees for the power of bad.
[35:55.970 --> 35:58.390]  And I want to take it back and use trees for the power.
[35:59.090 --> 36:02.490]  To be fair, they probably they probably took that idea from someone else.
[36:02.870 --> 36:04.950]  Yeah, they don't invent shit. They stole shit. Right.
[36:05.390 --> 36:07.490]  Almost certainly just a weird comparable.
[36:07.730 --> 36:11.910]  Like it reminds me of when you did the coin thing with the coin.
[36:12.050 --> 36:14.010]  Imagine the coin like you didn't need.
[36:14.110 --> 36:15.270]  You could have just said what it was.
[36:15.370 --> 36:17.630]  You didn't need to give context to where the idea may.
[36:17.730 --> 36:20.190]  I think I think context is always important.
[36:20.250 --> 36:21.530]  I don't know for that.
[36:22.010 --> 36:26.610]  That was just so we're clear.
[36:27.050 --> 36:30.150]  It would be an Ian logo or face.
[36:30.530 --> 36:32.010]  That is not the thing.
[36:32.090 --> 36:32.910]  That was the problem.
[36:33.450 --> 36:34.230]  We all get it.
[36:34.230 --> 36:35.550]  The Ian logo is great.
[36:35.850 --> 36:38.650]  Just sourcing it to it's terrible.
[36:39.930 --> 36:44.030]  But I'm sensing a pattern here with Geoff's with Geoff's writing thoughts.
[36:44.170 --> 36:48.930]  I'm going to guess that thought number five was about a road
[36:48.930 --> 36:51.570]  and thought number six was about the sky.
[36:51.690 --> 36:53.210]  And then I think there's a lot of ideas.
[36:53.430 --> 36:55.390]  So no, thought number five.
[36:55.490 --> 37:00.190]  Thought number five was building off of the Ian trees, which I think are a great idea.
[37:00.870 --> 37:03.130]  No, that got me thinking about other ways
[37:03.130 --> 37:06.350]  of nontraditionally promoting things from aerial views.
[37:06.670 --> 37:11.570]  And that got me thinking if we owned a farm like a corn or a wheat farm.
[37:11.930 --> 37:15.090]  I don't have one, but maybe we can pull our money together and get one uniform.
[37:15.210 --> 37:15.590]  There you go.
[37:16.210 --> 37:17.730]  We could do crop circles.
[37:18.070 --> 37:18.470]  We could do.
[37:18.690 --> 37:21.590]  I bet no one has ever done an Ian crop circle before.
[37:21.990 --> 37:24.190]  I mean, yeah.
[37:25.210 --> 37:27.570]  Like you can only see it from a from a low lying plane.
[37:27.690 --> 37:30.750]  Oh, from a low flying plane, which we want to credit Genghis Khan
[37:30.750 --> 37:32.330]  with the creation of the crop circle.
[37:32.330 --> 37:34.830]  How do you want to lead into this crop circle concept?
[37:35.110 --> 37:37.850]  Well, I didn't get to it through Genghis Khan.
[37:37.910 --> 37:41.810]  I got to the crop circle through the Ian trees,
[37:41.890 --> 37:43.910]  which I got to from the swastika thing.
[37:44.390 --> 37:47.210]  So if you want me to follow it all the way back, I can.
[37:47.570 --> 37:49.090]  The Genghis Khan was never a part of that.
[37:49.630 --> 37:51.090]  It came from the tree idea.
[37:51.190 --> 37:53.230]  I had the number four on the bullet list.
[37:53.790 --> 37:57.490]  Anyway, I think a giant Ian crop circle would be quite fun to make
[37:57.490 --> 37:58.510]  and could be very clever.
[37:58.970 --> 38:00.630]  Yeah, as long as we rent someone's crops.
[38:01.150 --> 38:02.650]  Yeah. Do you have crops?
[38:02.870 --> 38:06.750]  Are you a regulation listener or a comment leaver in possession
[38:06.750 --> 38:08.430]  of a large field of crop?
[38:08.830 --> 38:12.010]  Would you mind if we came in the middle of the night while you're asleep
[38:12.010 --> 38:16.190]  and pretended to be aliens with a long board on some string
[38:16.190 --> 38:20.110]  and we flattened just a little bit, just a little of your crops
[38:20.110 --> 38:24.930]  and to make a standard head, ears where they go, nose up top.
[38:25.070 --> 38:25.590]  That's all we got.
[38:27.570 --> 38:28.990]  Is that how they do it with a plank?
[38:29.470 --> 38:32.070]  Yeah, that's one of the ways to do it, for sure.
[38:32.290 --> 38:33.550]  Yeah, there's there's a couple different ways.
[38:34.030 --> 38:36.990]  I feel like just imagining we'd make a big like a big stamp.
[38:37.590 --> 38:38.750]  Just lower it down.
[38:39.790 --> 38:43.770]  Yeah, I like that method or like a Zamboni like machine for crops.
[38:47.690 --> 38:49.590]  And then my final one.
[38:50.150 --> 38:50.790]  My Zamboni.
[38:51.050 --> 38:51.430]  It's great.
[38:51.930 --> 38:55.850]  My final idea has nothing to do with crop circles or trees
[38:55.850 --> 38:57.970]  or planting any of any of that stuff, honestly.
[38:57.970 --> 39:00.990]  It was actually my first idea, but I pushed it to the last
[39:00.990 --> 39:03.710]  because I thought it was the weakest and I wasn't sure we'd get through them all.
[39:04.110 --> 39:08.110]  But my first one was just it was just an observation that my notes are a mess.
[39:08.370 --> 39:09.230]  Just an absolute mess.
[39:09.590 --> 39:12.210]  Gavin showed me his face notes the other night at dinner.
[39:12.330 --> 39:14.390]  We were at dinner with all those old, old, old people.
[39:15.750 --> 39:18.970]  And his notes are, first off, many.
[39:19.250 --> 39:23.250]  He has hundreds of notes and they all seem to make total sense.
[39:23.370 --> 39:25.850]  My notes like they're all sectioned a face.
[39:25.850 --> 39:28.670]  My notes are like, it'll go like face note, face note,
[39:29.490 --> 39:34.990]  the dimensions of a dresser, a shopping list for for Lowe's.
[39:35.790 --> 39:40.330]  No ideas from ideas from, yeah, ideas for a Minecraft series.
[39:40.690 --> 39:42.930]  So it's really social security. No, no.
[39:44.290 --> 39:47.570]  Yeah. Phone number that I need to remember for the chiropractor.
[39:47.670 --> 39:49.690]  Yeah, it's just like and then face note some.
[39:50.210 --> 39:52.650]  And as I was even writing these notes, I was looking at him and I was like,
[39:52.690 --> 39:54.570]  I was reminded, I was like, oh, well, here's your first note, buddy.
[39:54.810 --> 39:55.750]  You suck at notes.
[39:55.750 --> 40:01.190]  And then I should bring up how Gavin has really, really lovely notes.
[40:01.490 --> 40:05.250]  I mean, they're at least all organized, but it doesn't help me remember what they mean.
[40:05.590 --> 40:08.890]  Like I would say 50 percent of them have been mentioned in the other 50.
[40:09.170 --> 40:12.350]  I wrote them down and lost the connection with what they actually mean.
[40:12.590 --> 40:14.270]  Pull some up. See if we can figure it out.
[40:14.430 --> 40:19.430]  Decipher it. I recently got a new printer because here's my goal in life
[40:19.430 --> 40:21.950]  is to have a printer, right?
[40:21.950 --> 40:27.910]  That if you leave it for, you know, two weeks or more and then try to use it again,
[40:28.570 --> 40:31.950]  it prints. That would be a great idea for every revolution.
[40:32.130 --> 40:33.350]  I wish there was one that did that.
[40:33.530 --> 40:35.270]  But I got a new printer that has air print.
[40:35.590 --> 40:36.270]  What is air print?
[40:36.530 --> 40:39.610]  You just print from an iPhone just to install anything.
[40:39.910 --> 40:41.730]  How does it how does that work so far?
[40:42.170 --> 40:43.390]  It's worked once.
[40:43.410 --> 40:47.010]  I tested it by printing my face note.
[40:47.090 --> 40:51.070]  And when you see all that stuff printed onto paper and it's physically in front of you
[40:51.070 --> 40:55.190]  on several pages, it looks like the ramblings of a frickin lunatic.
[40:56.230 --> 40:59.550]  Let's see if we can decipher some of these, because I can't remember
[40:59.550 --> 41:02.570]  what I've talked about and what I've forgotten.
[41:03.030 --> 41:07.310]  By the way, as you're looking, I just say you hit on one of the greatest
[41:07.310 --> 41:10.830]  frustrations of my life, which is the fact that it's 2022
[41:11.430 --> 41:14.630]  and a printer technology still exists somewhere in 2006.
[41:15.390 --> 41:20.490]  Yeah. Yeah. If I if I'm not making like if I if I look at my printer
[41:20.490 --> 41:26.390]  and then look away and look back, it's like my my printer requires eye contact.
[41:26.790 --> 41:28.370]  It's such fucking bullshit.
[41:28.550 --> 41:30.570]  And Millie needs to print something once a month.
[41:30.750 --> 41:33.610]  And every time I have to end up unplugging the printer,
[41:33.610 --> 41:36.650]  which is like shoved into a into one of my shelves,
[41:36.730 --> 41:38.930]  I got to like rip it out of the shelf and unplug it for a while
[41:38.930 --> 41:40.350]  and plug it back in and then put it in.
[41:40.410 --> 41:41.330]  And then maybe it'll work.
[41:41.370 --> 41:43.390]  But I might have to unplug it as many as three times
[41:43.390 --> 41:46.410]  just to get it to do the one thing that it's supposed to do.
[41:46.570 --> 41:50.330]  Sorry, I just it is one of my biggest pet peeves.
[41:50.490 --> 41:52.910]  It's like quantum rules involved that we don't understand,
[41:53.070 --> 41:55.690]  that observing it sort of affects how it performs.
[41:57.230 --> 41:59.890]  French lifeguard mad that I didn't interrupt him.
[42:00.710 --> 42:01.670]  French lifeguard.
[42:01.890 --> 42:04.650]  OK, well, when were you last near a lifeguard?
[42:06.730 --> 42:07.530]  I don't know.
[42:08.230 --> 42:09.410]  When were you last in France?
[42:11.670 --> 42:12.230]  I don't know.
[42:12.330 --> 42:14.450]  He doesn't necessarily have to be in France.
[42:15.570 --> 42:19.010]  Could be a Hitman game where you just have to place 47's shit.
[42:20.070 --> 42:22.470]  Oh, I think I can kind of decipher that.
[42:23.170 --> 42:25.090]  Flowers could have been manly.
[42:28.770 --> 42:32.410]  I'm sure that was just like it is like a tradition thing where it's just like
[42:32.410 --> 42:37.030]  there's probably a universe where flowers are like a real bloke thing.
[42:37.570 --> 42:39.310]  Yeah. And women don't like dudes.
[42:39.470 --> 42:42.690]  Yeah. And it's just someone at some point decided
[42:43.330 --> 42:45.510]  flowers were more feminine, classically.
[42:45.670 --> 42:46.810]  And then that stuck.
[42:46.810 --> 42:50.350]  I like the idea of incorporating sneaker culture to flowers.
[42:50.590 --> 42:52.170]  I mean, like you see those fucking roses.
[42:52.370 --> 42:53.290]  Holy shit.
[42:53.950 --> 42:55.910]  Somebody coming over to hang out with Megan, like, where's Gavin?
[42:56.010 --> 42:56.690]  I thought he was home today.
[42:56.710 --> 42:59.230]  And she's like, he's in the garage playing with his tulips.
[43:01.070 --> 43:04.170]  I finally understand the geographical importance
[43:04.170 --> 43:06.810]  of moving from Philly to Beverly Hills.
[43:09.050 --> 43:11.450]  I think that was the first prince.
[43:11.770 --> 43:16.290]  Yeah, I was like, I think I was just like one wheeling around
[43:16.290 --> 43:19.570]  and I was like, oh, that's actually quite a big move.
[43:19.670 --> 43:22.450]  That's like thousands of miles.
[43:22.570 --> 43:25.490]  But as living as a kid in England and not understanding
[43:26.010 --> 43:28.410]  that those two places could actually be far apart
[43:28.410 --> 43:32.610]  because my country is very small in comparison, you just drive anywhere in a day.
[43:33.030 --> 43:36.550]  I suddenly just hit me as I was like bopping along to it in my head.
[43:36.610 --> 43:38.370]  I was like, oh, damn, that's far.
[43:39.150 --> 43:40.630]  Well, it's also a country
[43:42.110 --> 43:43.950]  socioeconomically very far away, too.
[43:43.950 --> 43:48.950]  Yeah, he was in West Philadelphia, which was sort of a roughshod
[43:48.950 --> 43:50.050]  neighborhood at the time.
[43:50.290 --> 43:53.470]  And all of the information is provided in the intro of the show.
[43:53.690 --> 43:57.710]  I just never picked up on all those cues of like, oh, that's the concept.
[43:58.190 --> 44:01.710]  Was the song too good for you to understand the premise of it?
[44:01.750 --> 44:04.750]  Like it's a rare case where the intro song was like, you're just like,
[44:04.790 --> 44:05.970]  this is a fucking banger.
[44:06.230 --> 44:10.030]  I think it's one of those things where you hear it as a kid and you
[44:10.590 --> 44:13.230]  you know the words, but you don't listen to the words.
[44:13.230 --> 44:16.670]  Yeah, kind of like the the problem I had with a galaxy far, far away.
[44:16.810 --> 44:19.010]  It's like it had gone in, but I'd never listened to it.
[44:19.370 --> 44:21.110]  Yeah. And I never watched the Fresh Prince.
[44:21.210 --> 44:23.330]  I just knew I just knew the intro.
[44:23.430 --> 44:26.350]  So I didn't I didn't I also didn't get those clues from watching the show.
[44:26.670 --> 44:31.250]  I see. Do you do you have ever?
[44:31.430 --> 44:32.890]  Or like maybe when you were a kid,
[44:32.970 --> 44:36.470]  you were in England around English people who speak with English accents.
[44:36.670 --> 44:40.670]  Do you ever listen to like American music or like, like, say, like that song
[44:40.670 --> 44:43.750]  and have trouble understanding the words because of American accents?
[44:44.430 --> 44:46.610]  No, because I grew up watching American TV.
[44:46.870 --> 44:48.130]  So I guess so. Yeah.
[44:48.130 --> 44:49.350]  This is prevalent.
[44:50.030 --> 44:53.750]  Yeah, I grew up on, you know, Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, Keenan and Cal.
[44:54.030 --> 44:55.030]  So pretty.
[44:55.990 --> 44:57.630]  But Keenan Street continues.
[44:58.930 --> 45:01.150]  I was just like the 10th mention.
[45:02.750 --> 45:04.770]  Goddamn. I was just in London for a week.
[45:04.830 --> 45:08.350]  And I'd say about 15 percent of the British people I still can't understand.
[45:08.790 --> 45:09.950]  Oh, really? Just walking down the street.
[45:10.750 --> 45:12.590]  You'll hear some people talking. You're like, whoa.
[45:13.790 --> 45:14.770]  That's funny. Yeah.
[45:14.790 --> 45:15.350]  Do you do an impression?
[45:17.270 --> 45:20.410]  Yeah, it's like the impression I used to use to make fun of Dan.
[45:20.530 --> 45:21.410]  It's like that.
[45:23.170 --> 45:24.550]  I don't know if I'm up for it right now.
[45:25.750 --> 45:29.230]  I thought it'd be a fun idea one day.
[45:29.450 --> 45:35.170]  And I and I added a few spaces after I after episode 100 came out.
[45:35.230 --> 45:38.450]  So I'm now in like a separate set of notes below that.
[45:38.450 --> 45:40.970]  But I thought it'd be really fun to one day just print the list
[45:41.950 --> 45:45.390]  and like give it away, give it to charity or something or like auction it for a
[45:45.890 --> 45:47.830]  like sign it and auction it for extra life or something,
[45:47.890 --> 45:49.210]  because it's just bizarre ramblings.
[45:49.550 --> 45:50.590]  And even I don't know what they are.
[45:50.810 --> 45:52.330]  What if you print out a hundred?
[45:52.850 --> 45:54.550]  We'll staple them, print out. How many pages is it?
[45:54.810 --> 45:56.170]  It was up to episode 100.
[45:56.270 --> 45:58.030]  It was four pages of normal.
[45:58.050 --> 46:01.730]  All right. So so we'll we'll print a hundred of each.
[46:02.190 --> 46:05.270]  Then we'll we'll staple them and then we'll hit them all with baseball bats.
[46:07.290 --> 46:08.410]  It's like a notary.
[46:10.230 --> 46:12.430]  We're going to notarize them and make them official.
[46:14.850 --> 46:15.570]  Notarized ramblings.
[46:17.330 --> 46:20.390]  I can hit it with the gold foil Ian stamp and that can be a ramblings.
[46:21.350 --> 46:24.470]  Do you have a list, Andrew, that's constantly being added to?
[46:24.570 --> 46:26.270]  Or are you just like separate notes sort of guy?
[46:26.510 --> 46:28.030]  I I sort of I delete.
[46:28.150 --> 46:29.770]  So I write a bunch of things.
[46:30.230 --> 46:32.930]  If I have a bigger thing I've planned, that's just sort of in my head.
[46:32.950 --> 46:34.570]  But when I I sit down,
[46:34.570 --> 46:37.830]  typically the night before and write down all the ideas that I remember
[46:37.830 --> 46:40.690]  talking about, put them in a list and then I'll delete them
[46:40.690 --> 46:42.970]  as we talk about them as we record.
[46:43.390 --> 46:45.130]  So I don't have an ongoing list. I should.
[46:45.350 --> 46:48.230]  Huh. I regret not having that be interesting to go back and see
[46:48.230 --> 46:50.310]  like where different things were or sometimes, you know,
[46:50.330 --> 46:52.210]  like you'll have a thing on a list that you plan on using
[46:52.210 --> 46:53.330]  and then just doesn't come up.
[46:53.410 --> 46:54.930]  So it'll just be on there for multiple weeks.
[46:55.750 --> 46:57.830]  All right. Yeah, I don't even go.
[46:58.150 --> 47:00.990]  I will say I love your I'm going back to one of the constant.
[47:01.130 --> 47:03.110]  We didn't decipher the hit man thing.
[47:03.590 --> 47:07.190]  I think what that is, is in hit man, you have unlimited inventory
[47:07.190 --> 47:12.110]  for certain items and the premise of like after he's done a job,
[47:12.210 --> 47:17.570]  he has 27 bottles of vodka in his suit, six rubber ducks, nine knives.
[47:17.650 --> 47:20.830]  Like I think that that might be like the absurdity of those games
[47:20.830 --> 47:23.970]  where like when you finish, if you think about the weight of those items
[47:23.970 --> 47:26.330]  and just trying to maneuver with them, it's hilarious.
[47:26.610 --> 47:27.810]  It's a very funny premise.
[47:28.010 --> 47:29.490]  I think it was just that you can.
[47:29.490 --> 47:33.890]  You can have a weapon stash and then you'll go into like a bathroom
[47:33.890 --> 47:37.210]  or like a stock room and there'll be a frickin giant sniper rifle in there
[47:37.210 --> 47:37.650]  or something.
[47:38.210 --> 47:41.630]  And I see an interesting part of the game to have to be the person
[47:41.630 --> 47:45.170]  who either goes ahead of 47, who clears up after him,
[47:45.210 --> 47:46.890]  would be like a funny concept for DLC.
[47:48.210 --> 47:52.110]  Because in the older games, if you left stuff behind,
[47:52.230 --> 47:55.390]  if you left like your suit, it would cost you because they'd have to send
[47:55.390 --> 47:58.110]  people in to go pick it up if you left a weapon on the floor.
[47:58.110 --> 48:01.210]  Yeah. So basically be like the hitman cleanup crew.
[48:01.690 --> 48:03.710]  Yeah. Yeah. I like that. Great idea.
[48:04.010 --> 48:04.930]  You just go in with a mop.
[48:06.110 --> 48:09.310]  I was just thinking more like the reverse side of that, of, you know,
[48:09.350 --> 48:12.610]  like the concept of coming home from work and like getting on your work clothes,
[48:12.710 --> 48:17.090]  like 47 having to do that and pull the seven ducks he has in his pocket
[48:17.090 --> 48:20.030]  out, like just the annoyance of like what his work brings.
[48:20.170 --> 48:21.170]  Yeah. Just the hassle.
[48:22.410 --> 48:23.750]  Yeah. Five burgers.
[48:24.010 --> 48:26.330]  Like it's the most random dumb stuff.
[48:28.110 --> 48:29.410]  It'd be heavy. That'd be funny.
[48:29.530 --> 48:32.070]  If I use TikTok or something, that'd be funny.
[48:32.370 --> 48:35.310]  Yeah. Just be like dressed as 47, walking into a room
[48:35.310 --> 48:37.410]  and just like throwing stuff on the floor or on the bed.
[48:37.730 --> 48:41.510]  It's like a VR game in my head of like you have to lift up your jacket
[48:41.510 --> 48:45.330]  and just like physically remove all of the shit that you brought with you.
[48:45.730 --> 48:49.930]  That'd be a funny little short to film of like wife, like in bed
[48:49.930 --> 48:53.270]  in like a king sized bed with like fluffy pillows everywhere,
[48:53.530 --> 48:55.290]  like a floral print duvet.
[48:55.290 --> 48:59.670]  And she's like reading a better housekeeping or like a Vogue magazine
[48:59.670 --> 49:01.410]  or like a copy of The New Yorker.
[49:01.730 --> 49:03.710]  And her husband comes in and he's like taking a bath.
[49:03.910 --> 49:04.890]  And she's like, long day.
[49:05.010 --> 49:05.990]  And he's like the usual.
[49:06.290 --> 49:09.710]  And then he just starts emptying his pockets on the coffee on like the dresser,
[49:09.750 --> 49:15.990]  you know, and I could watch pin, billfold, you know, some paperclips.
[49:16.730 --> 49:20.030]  Then it's like the little like piano wire that you slit throats with
[49:20.030 --> 49:23.790]  and then the ducks and then a sniper rifle and just keeps piling up.
[49:23.790 --> 49:24.950]  19 key cards.
[49:25.170 --> 49:29.350]  Yeah, I would love to submit that to Matt Bragg for like a challenge accepted,
[49:29.530 --> 49:33.690]  like a weird episode where you just have to like walk into the bank level of
[49:34.210 --> 49:37.070]  Hitman 2 or something, pick up as much shit as possible
[49:37.070 --> 49:40.010]  and then see if you can hold all that stuff in real life on your person.
[49:40.270 --> 49:41.170]  I like that it plays.
[49:41.290 --> 49:44.050]  You always hear about with women's clothes, their lack of pockets,
[49:44.130 --> 49:47.110]  like the obnoxious thing that he has so many fucking pockets.
[49:47.310 --> 49:50.270]  Well, that was what I was trying to solve with the wrist pocket, right?
[49:50.310 --> 49:53.610]  Was to add a pocket on the body because women's clothes are bullshit.
[49:54.330 --> 49:57.490]  You know, we actually did something similar to this, Gavin, way, way, way,
[49:57.510 --> 50:02.550]  way, way back in the early in the early aughts, probably around 2009, 2010
[50:03.970 --> 50:06.650]  for Immersion, that series we used to do where we attempted.
[50:07.250 --> 50:08.490]  Well, then you did it after I stopped.
[50:08.910 --> 50:12.130]  You did the next iteration of it where you try video game principles
[50:12.130 --> 50:13.510]  in real life to see how they work.
[50:13.750 --> 50:17.970]  And we had all of the weapons you would carry with you in Doom
[50:17.970 --> 50:21.350]  that you had to carry on your body and see how you could traverse the battlefield.
[50:21.350 --> 50:22.830]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[50:23.150 --> 50:24.910]  It was that the one with an explosion in it.
[50:25.410 --> 50:26.090]  Yeah, I think so.
[50:26.190 --> 50:29.730]  I think it had an explosion and we had like 80 pounds of like 800 pounds
[50:29.730 --> 50:30.850]  of guns on her around her neck.
[50:30.850 --> 50:34.350]  And you were locked in a car laughing at Jack.
[50:35.090 --> 50:36.130]  Oh, that was the same day.
[50:36.210 --> 50:37.070]  Yeah. You mentioned that.
[50:37.170 --> 50:40.870]  We mentioned that on the on that on the annual anal passage podcast
[50:40.870 --> 50:42.490]  that we did on Monday. Yeah.
[50:44.570 --> 50:45.210]  Oh, man.
[50:45.590 --> 50:48.370]  At dinner the other night, Geoff and I were talking about f***face.
[50:48.570 --> 50:51.030]  Geoff was like, yeah, you know, I think we're done with the Bovril phase.
[50:51.030 --> 50:52.630]  I wonder what the next phase will be.
[50:52.890 --> 50:55.810]  And I was just and I was just about to say, oh, I've got a pretty good invention.
[50:56.030 --> 50:58.270]  And Geoff was like, I think I'm done inventing s***.
[50:58.350 --> 50:58.790]  I was like, oh,
[51:00.410 --> 51:03.430]  I did. I said, I think I'm going to take a break from inventing stuff for a while.
[51:03.470 --> 51:04.490]  I don't want to get too old.
[51:04.590 --> 51:08.190]  And Gavin goes, well, I just just about to say I have a
[51:08.190 --> 51:10.310]  I've created the next nice to threat you.
[51:11.370 --> 51:15.010]  And it's something I can hold on to until enough people have new inventions
[51:15.010 --> 51:17.110]  for the next round of uniform pitching.
[51:17.570 --> 51:19.610]  I like that idea. Got something in the bag.
[51:19.610 --> 51:21.470]  OK. Yeah, it's not it's not a standalone thing.
[51:21.550 --> 51:22.450]  It wouldn't hold up on its own.
[51:22.530 --> 51:25.910]  But if there were two other inventions to dampen the blow, I'm sure it could work.
[51:26.350 --> 51:29.690]  Take some extra notes so that six months from now, when we get back to it,
[51:29.690 --> 51:30.970]  you recognize what it is.
[51:31.350 --> 51:33.390]  Oh, that's a good point. I don't think I've written that one down.
[51:34.310 --> 51:37.890]  Speaking of Bovril, the day we recorded last week,
[51:38.650 --> 51:40.970]  those popsicles took the life out of me.
[51:41.310 --> 51:43.450]  I was a full zombie afterwards.
[51:43.630 --> 51:45.810]  I don't really remember the episode we recorded afterward.
[51:46.030 --> 51:46.970]  I was drained.
[51:46.970 --> 51:50.970]  I was just physically exhausted for the whole day.
[51:51.070 --> 51:53.010]  And I'm like, I can never have Bovril again.
[51:53.310 --> 51:54.310]  I need to take a break from that.
[51:54.650 --> 51:55.610]  Salad cream is ruined.
[51:56.510 --> 52:00.410]  Pancakes are on the on the bench right now as well as it's like,
[52:00.510 --> 52:01.910]  oh, this is terrible.
[52:02.150 --> 52:05.790]  And I went to my mailbox and I opened my mailbox
[52:06.330 --> 52:08.110]  and there is a package waiting for me.
[52:08.130 --> 52:10.510]  And I was so excited for a brief moment.
[52:10.850 --> 52:13.930]  And then I realized it's the Bovril that Gavin sent.
[52:13.930 --> 52:19.690]  So now I have two full bottles of Bovril that I have no idea what I'm going to do with.
[52:20.010 --> 52:21.650]  Well, I can tell you what you're going to do with them.
[52:21.750 --> 52:24.190]  You're going to spread one on toast and have it that way.
[52:24.290 --> 52:27.090]  And then you're going to you're going to take a teaspoon of the other
[52:27.090 --> 52:29.490]  and you're going to mix it in boiling water and drink it like coffee.
[52:30.210 --> 52:32.030]  I one day we will get one day.
[52:32.250 --> 52:37.450]  One day. Listen, we I feel like we hit Bovril pretty hard for about four episodes there.
[52:37.510 --> 52:40.450]  I think that I think the world could use a little Bovril break.
[52:40.590 --> 52:42.070]  So I certainly tomorrow. Yeah.
[52:42.070 --> 52:44.630]  I just like that message I got on on Amazon.
[52:44.970 --> 52:46.790]  Your package was left in the mail slot.
[52:47.190 --> 52:49.070]  What shape is that?
[52:53.910 --> 52:55.630]  Are you just going to tip it away?
[52:56.510 --> 53:01.270]  No, no, I'll save it and maybe I'll try it again down the road.
[53:01.410 --> 53:02.430]  But I just we're on break.
[53:02.950 --> 53:04.110]  We're on break with the Bovril.
[53:04.490 --> 53:07.710]  It might be a good way to heal your Bovril damage.
[53:08.170 --> 53:08.990]  In what way?
[53:09.490 --> 53:10.430]  Like, well, just you had it.
[53:10.550 --> 53:12.650]  You had it in its worst form, potentially.
[53:13.190 --> 53:17.510]  And potentially to have a nice, delicious warm cup might might heal the taste.
[53:18.030 --> 53:20.730]  I feel like you need to try a Bovril.
[53:20.930 --> 53:22.930]  It might melt your frozen Bovril heart.
[53:23.330 --> 53:25.650]  Because I haven't had Bovril in any other form.
[53:25.730 --> 53:29.010]  It'd be interesting to hear from you as someone who likes Bovril.
[53:29.450 --> 53:32.110]  Is it a worse version of Bovril or is it?
[53:32.250 --> 53:33.290]  Do I just not like Bovril?
[53:33.790 --> 53:34.990]  Well, what's your favorite food?
[53:34.990 --> 53:37.230]  That's probably chicken.
[53:37.630 --> 53:40.070]  I'd say a chicken dish or like a chicken parmesan.
[53:40.610 --> 53:44.170]  Right. So if you had to eat like a chicken ice cube, you probably wouldn't like it.
[53:44.470 --> 53:47.590]  But then if you had chicken after, you'd be like, damn, chicken's good.
[53:48.130 --> 53:49.210]  That's a fair comparable.
[53:49.330 --> 53:53.050]  But Bovril sold Bovril pops like it was the thing that they did.
[53:53.170 --> 53:53.590]  That's fair.
[53:54.110 --> 53:54.830]  So I don't know.
[53:54.870 --> 53:59.070]  I feel like when the company endorses the product in that way,
[53:59.110 --> 54:00.370]  it's a different comparable.
[54:01.210 --> 54:02.890]  Does anybody sell chicken pops?
[54:02.890 --> 54:06.290]  Because if not, you know, I could get into that world.
[54:06.830 --> 54:08.890]  Hold on. Googling frozen.
[54:09.730 --> 54:13.190]  I could see like a chicken noodle soup like pop type thing.
[54:14.250 --> 54:16.570]  Oh, that's just what that pop.
[54:16.670 --> 54:19.910]  I bet you there's like Lester makes terrible sodas.
[54:19.950 --> 54:22.190]  Like that's the company that does like the ranch soda.
[54:22.390 --> 54:24.190]  I bet you they got like a chicken soda.
[54:24.610 --> 54:26.650]  Oh, God, that's the ugliest thing.
[54:28.150 --> 54:29.230]  What did you find?
[54:29.730 --> 54:30.730]  Yeah, hold on.
[54:34.850 --> 54:36.670]  Oh, I hate it.
[54:37.170 --> 54:39.630]  Is that just for like presentation or is that frozen?
[54:39.730 --> 54:41.930]  That just looks like normal like a Kiev or something.
[54:42.090 --> 54:43.570]  Yeah, I don't know.
[54:43.730 --> 54:46.390]  It was for the for the audience.
[54:46.530 --> 54:51.710]  It's just a piece of fried chicken in the shape of a popsicle with a popsicle stick.
[54:51.910 --> 54:53.890]  And it's like it just it's fucking gross.
[54:54.390 --> 54:55.570]  And I got to get out of it.
[54:55.630 --> 54:57.190]  Is it weird that looks really good to me?
[54:57.190 --> 54:59.430]  It's called chicken popsicle nuggets.
[54:59.630 --> 55:00.670]  Oh, my God.
[55:00.810 --> 55:03.330]  I think if you remove the stick, it looks great.
[55:03.690 --> 55:05.450]  But the stick's great for dipping.
[55:06.090 --> 55:07.470]  It's already dippable.
[55:07.650 --> 55:08.310]  It's it's bread.
[55:08.470 --> 55:08.930]  Oh, my God.
[55:08.970 --> 55:09.950]  You know, we could call it.
[55:10.370 --> 55:12.130]  What? Pop Chickles.
[55:13.070 --> 55:14.150]  I hate it.
[55:15.030 --> 55:16.670]  Ah, that's like it works.
[55:17.030 --> 55:17.690]  Pop Chickles.
[55:17.790 --> 55:18.550]  I love it.
[55:18.970 --> 55:21.470]  You know, David dust off that idea.
[55:21.570 --> 55:25.030]  We're back to invent frozen pop Chickles.
[55:25.170 --> 55:26.050]  Oh, my God.
[55:28.410 --> 55:29.990]  Inspiration has struck.
[55:30.550 --> 55:32.930]  Oh, I'm going to here.
[55:33.030 --> 55:36.430]  This is a I had a friend send me this food recently,
[55:36.430 --> 55:39.790]  and I think it's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.
[55:39.910 --> 55:40.710]  They loved it.
[55:40.830 --> 55:43.410]  I fucking I had a visceral reaction when I saw it.
[55:43.750 --> 55:44.650]  Fruit sushi.
[55:45.670 --> 55:46.110]  Horrendous.
[55:46.350 --> 55:47.190]  I like that.
[55:47.410 --> 55:48.850]  You think that looks great?
[55:48.970 --> 55:49.970]  It was the white stuff.
[55:50.010 --> 55:51.050]  Is it rice or is it fruit?
[55:51.410 --> 55:51.430]  It's rice.
[55:51.710 --> 55:52.530]  It's rice.
[55:52.670 --> 55:53.130]  The white stuff.
[55:53.550 --> 55:54.730]  What's the green stuff?
[55:55.410 --> 55:56.090]  I don't know.
[55:56.170 --> 55:56.970]  I still don't know.
[55:56.970 --> 55:58.230]  I've been trying to figure that out for days.
[55:58.250 --> 55:59.910]  If it's fruit, then I'm all about that.
[56:00.010 --> 56:01.210]  If it looks like a fruit loop.
[56:01.770 --> 56:02.630]  You like that.
[56:03.230 --> 56:06.330]  I thought I dude, I love fruit, man.
[56:06.410 --> 56:07.390]  What would be bad about that?
[56:07.430 --> 56:08.970]  Well, some sushi has fruit in it.
[56:09.070 --> 56:11.270]  Well, you get to get some like mango in there sometimes or.
[56:12.030 --> 56:13.190]  But I just it's too much.
[56:13.210 --> 56:15.630]  And the fact that it comes with like a fucking Nutella dip.
[56:15.690 --> 56:17.410]  Like, it's just not what I want from sushi.
[56:17.710 --> 56:19.890]  Oh, I guess I would eat the shit out of that.
[56:19.990 --> 56:20.830]  I would love that.
[56:21.910 --> 56:25.450]  Guys, from what I can tell, there does not exist
[56:26.990 --> 56:29.170]  a frozen chicken flavored Popsicle.
[56:29.390 --> 56:31.730]  I think the market might be wide open for us.
[56:31.810 --> 56:32.350]  This is exciting.
[56:33.210 --> 56:33.950]  This is really exciting.
[56:34.050 --> 56:36.970]  And to pair it with fruit sushi, although it seems like that's been done before.
[56:37.150 --> 56:38.390]  You want to stick that in prop F?
[56:38.950 --> 56:39.830]  I want to know.
[56:39.870 --> 56:42.390]  I want to know what the green thing is.
[56:42.770 --> 56:44.270]  I've been trying to figure it out for days.
[56:44.370 --> 56:44.730]  I don't know.
[56:44.810 --> 56:46.390]  I think it kind of looks fruit roll up.
[56:46.790 --> 56:48.090]  It looks like a fruit roll up.
[56:48.210 --> 56:51.570]  If that's a fruit roll up, sign me up.
[56:52.090 --> 56:53.210]  I would prefer it without.
[56:53.210 --> 56:56.090]  I prefer that it's like a thinly sliced melon or something
[56:56.090 --> 56:57.590]  or a cucumber or something.
[56:58.250 --> 56:59.350]  Yeah, cucumber is great.
[56:59.830 --> 57:03.090]  If the rice was like coconut, then I could get on board.
[57:03.210 --> 57:04.930]  But the fact that it's like sushi rice.
[57:05.470 --> 57:06.910]  I want to get a rice and fruit.
[57:07.130 --> 57:10.430]  I don't like those are all things individually I enjoy.
[57:10.510 --> 57:15.410]  But combined, I fucking I think this would now this would limit your ability
[57:15.410 --> 57:17.330]  to eat it and make it a quicker deal.
[57:17.350 --> 57:21.870]  But what if it's what if the the the rice was just like shaved ice
[57:21.870 --> 57:25.190]  like from like from your I'm all in at that.
[57:25.290 --> 57:28.690]  I'm out like it's fruit shaved ice wrapped in,
[57:29.470 --> 57:33.050]  I guess, either a cucumber or a fruit roll up.
[57:33.130 --> 57:35.490]  I'm all in. I think this is great ice.
[57:35.770 --> 57:37.790]  Ice to me isn't useful in the food.
[57:38.230 --> 57:40.750]  It's like good in a cooler from keeping shit cold.
[57:40.830 --> 57:41.410]  That's liquid.
[57:41.710 --> 57:42.590]  I don't want to eat ice.
[57:42.690 --> 57:43.290]  I don't want ice in my drink.
[57:43.290 --> 57:44.450]  What about a snow cone?
[57:44.750 --> 57:46.530]  A snow cone is so good.
[57:46.670 --> 57:47.490]  No, get out of here.
[57:47.970 --> 57:48.730]  Get out of here.
[57:48.930 --> 57:50.610]  When was the last time you had a snow cone?
[57:51.870 --> 57:52.770]  Probably with you.
[57:52.930 --> 57:57.870]  I think I could just see Gavin in a park eating a fucking hot chicken popsicle.
[57:57.870 --> 57:58.990]  Be like, get out of here.
[57:59.110 --> 58:02.370]  It's all this stuff we're going.
[58:02.670 --> 58:06.990]  We're going to Bahama Bucks soon and you're going to get a snow cone
[58:06.990 --> 58:08.770]  and you're going to fucking like it or else.
[58:08.930 --> 58:11.390]  What's that little place that's on 51st Street?
[58:14.660 --> 58:15.920]  Like a snow cone place?
[58:16.220 --> 58:18.000]  Yeah. Is it still there?
[58:18.460 --> 58:22.280]  Oh, oh, Casey's New Orleans snow cones.
[58:22.280 --> 58:24.620]  Yeah. Yeah, I wouldn't, you know, it's fine.
[58:24.720 --> 58:25.920]  That place is that place is OK.
[58:26.040 --> 58:26.820]  There's better places to go.
[58:26.960 --> 58:28.500]  I mean, that place is like an awesome institution.
[58:28.740 --> 58:30.580]  But no, no, we're going to go to Bahama Bucks.
[58:30.760 --> 58:34.960]  We're going to go to the suburbs to a chain and get you some snow cones.
[58:35.080 --> 58:36.520]  You want nerd flavored snow cones?
[58:36.660 --> 58:37.300]  They got nerd.
[58:37.400 --> 58:39.660]  They got a Red Bull snow cone they just came out with.
[58:39.760 --> 58:40.800]  I saw. God damn it.
[58:41.040 --> 58:42.260]  Emily's on the mailing list.
[58:42.560 --> 58:44.500]  Yeah, we've been going to America.
[58:45.280 --> 58:47.380]  Next time I'm in Austin, I want a snow cone.
[58:47.400 --> 58:48.680]  I fucking love snow cones.
[58:48.840 --> 58:49.780]  Snow cones are the best.
[58:50.400 --> 58:51.120]  They're incredible.
[58:51.120 --> 58:53.500]  I it hurts me that Gavin doesn't like.
[58:53.900 --> 58:55.640]  Oh, I've just never had a good one.
[58:55.780 --> 58:56.180]  Give me a good one.
[58:56.280 --> 58:57.740]  You've never had a good one.
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.840]  I never had one that was like anything to write home about.
[59:01.340 --> 59:03.160]  Look at what's going on on that website.
[59:03.640 --> 59:06.100]  OK, so tell me you don't want to look at that menu.
[59:06.400 --> 59:08.000]  Oh, it's more than shaved ice.
[59:08.060 --> 59:10.900]  It's a menu. Shaved ice and snow cones.
[59:11.100 --> 59:14.320]  Oh, so is this different to like the one I've had was just like ice
[59:14.320 --> 59:17.160]  and then they drizzle a bit of syrup or something in it.
[59:17.580 --> 59:19.300]  I think it's that's the heart of it.
[59:19.300 --> 59:20.240]  That's the heart of it.
[59:20.260 --> 59:21.580]  Yeah, there's like a million.
[59:21.880 --> 59:25.340]  You end up with like bits of ice down the side that never had the flavor.
[59:25.440 --> 59:25.880]  Touch it.
[59:25.980 --> 59:27.660]  That's just part of the experience.
[59:27.900 --> 59:28.900]  No, it's a shit experience.
[59:29.220 --> 59:31.260]  No, it's a it's a tough experience.
[59:31.600 --> 59:32.400]  I have a new candy.
[59:32.860 --> 59:34.300]  I wasn't sure if I was going to bring this up.
[59:34.860 --> 59:37.680]  I don't know if it's better than the gummy nerds,
[59:37.680 --> 59:41.940]  but I just recently discovered that there are Skittle gummies.
[59:42.420 --> 59:44.560]  The Skittle Wildberry gummies. Very good.
[59:44.900 --> 59:47.060]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, dude, I've had those.
[59:47.440 --> 59:48.120]  I've never had.
[59:48.120 --> 59:49.420]  I just discovered them recently.
[59:49.560 --> 59:50.540]  I was like, these are fucking great.
[59:50.600 --> 59:51.840]  I got to talk about these gummies.
[59:52.380 --> 59:55.600]  I know you're you're dead on with those Wildberry specifically.
[59:55.820 --> 59:57.700]  Yeah, those are Wildberry specifically. Very good.
[59:57.800 --> 01:00:01.460]  I don't really care for the Wildberry Skittle, but the gummy. Fantastic.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:03.760]  Yeah, I can't.
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:04.660]  I don't like snow.
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:06.560]  I stand that he's fucking British.
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.540]  He doesn't like anything cold in your mouth.
[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:10.800]  You know, I still want ice in my mouth.
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:15.060]  I don't know why, but a chicken, a hot chicken popsicle does feel very British
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:16.780]  to me. I can see that.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.660]  I don't know why, but there's.
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:19.540]  Please call it British.
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:20.160]  Please buy it.
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.900]  Call it by its official uniform name.
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:22.620]  The Popsicle.
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.020]  The Popsicle.
[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.760]  We need to see it as such.
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:27.280]  We need to get that name out there.
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:30.960]  Being from England, I like I like the idea of stuff that keeps me warm.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.580]  And that just looks like a hearty meal on a stick.
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:36.160]  This dude would rather eat warm.
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:41.620]  This dude would rather eat warm beef juice than a nice cold
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:46.440]  banana and black cherry snow cone on a hot day.
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:51.440]  He'd be he'd be like, I'm going to dip my Popsicle in my bovril and soak that up.
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:53.220]  You are 100 percent correct.
[01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:55.800]  What would you put on a Popsicle?
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.120]  You dip, you dip, do you cover it?
[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:01.680]  What is your like ketchup?
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:02.600]  You just go ketchup.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:03.580]  I just go ketchup.
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:05.680]  What do you put your what?
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.040]  Well, it goes back to what do you put?
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:08.880]  What do you use for your chicken nuggets?
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:09.580]  I use ketchup.
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:12.620]  I could do barbecue sauce, but it's hard to bad.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.140]  I feel like barbecue sauce would be good.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.760]  Yeah, I think I could try barbecue sauce.
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.160]  I wish more places made tempura.
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:23.560]  Like that should be it's just it's like you deep fry it, right?
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.380]  Like that should be something that's more available.
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:29.420]  I hate that you have to it's limited to essentially Japanese places.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.880]  Like I want to be able to go to McDonald's and get tempura.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.940]  I want I want someone to make me
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.560]  fruit sushi with frozen ice now, like shaved ice.
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.180]  I'm pretty sure that doesn't exist in the world, but now I'm thinking about it.
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:48.080]  That's going to be a nightmare because it's going to it's going to melt.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.960]  If it melts, then you've got nothing to eat.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.880]  It's just going to spread out in the well, the way it works, the way it works.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.200]  Right. Is the way it would work.
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:58.440]  I went to our our our favorite restaurant last night, Gav,
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.720]  the one that, you know, you and I and we went to recently together.
[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:06.660]  And, you know, for dessert, they give you like, for instance, last night,
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:10.320]  they usually give you this like shaved ice with a little bit of creme fraiche,
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.440]  which I could take or leave and then pomegranate.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.500]  But they've changed it now. So it's strawberry.
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:17.480]  So it's like strawberry shaved ice with little bits of strawberry and then creme
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.300]  fraiche. And it was so good.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.740]  But it's like you get like it's like a little digestif, right?
[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:24.240]  Like you get it like right at the end of the meal.
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:26.020]  It's basically two bites and you're done.
[01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:28.400]  I think that the presentation would have to be similar.
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:31.580]  You would get like just one little sushi roll or two little sushi rolls.
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:35.420]  And then it's not meant to stick around, meant to just be like a little.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:39.180]  I feel like those little balls you get there, it's like one grain size up
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:40.040]  from a sorbet.
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:43.680]  It's like somewhere in between a snow cone and a sorbet.
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:46.740]  Sorbet is great. Big fan of a sorbet.
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.180]  Oh, yeah, absolutely love.
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:49.740]  I'll take just about anything cold.
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:52.220]  Yeah, I think I think it's definitely like Gavin.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:57.680]  Gavin grew up in the cold and dreary, wet, gray England.
[01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:02.400]  And then I grew up in hot, sticky Alabama on the ocean.
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:06.740]  And so it was just like 100 percent humidity and heat all day,
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:07.720]  every day of my life.
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:11.880]  So I was looking for any excuse to put something cold in my mouth.
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.100]  Yeah, makes total sense.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.440]  Yeah. Bye.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.760]  All right. OK, he's saying bye.
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.500]  That's just because it's four.
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:25.900]  Oh, I guess we should wrap up.
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:27.660]  We don't we don't want to keep you, Gavin.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.900]  There you have it. Gavin's done.
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:31.460]  He's had enough of this podcast.
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.320]  I was just doing Eric's job.
[01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:35.040]  He's not here, so he doesn't get a lot of it.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:41.080]  Hopefully he'll see fit to show up and dame us with another hour of this presence
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.500]  next week on episode 104.
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.080]  We sure do appreciate it.
[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:49.860]  I could have talked to you for hours, audience, as I know Andrew could as well.
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:53.720]  Yeah, but other people intervened and you have to be respectful to,
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:55.260]  well, the worst of us, honestly.
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.680]  So there you have it.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:00.040]  Episode one or three in the books, like and subscribe or whatever.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:00.960]  Love you. Bye.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.580]  Hey, guys. Regular fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:06.600]  Let's talk Freddy versus Jason.
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:09.560]  Annual pass has the best selling F*** Face shirt.
[01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:11.340]  Alexa is a religious figure.
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:13.500]  Gavin can't get over the overkill.
[01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:15.660]  This will be a November to remember.
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.880]  Have we discovered the previously on guy?
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.800]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:23.900]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
