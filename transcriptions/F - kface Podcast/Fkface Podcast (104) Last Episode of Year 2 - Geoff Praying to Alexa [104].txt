[00:05.180 --> 00:06.480]  Previously on F*** Face.
[00:16.450 --> 00:20.470]  No, but I'm thinking about like, you hear with like Freddy Krueger or whatever, where
[00:20.470 --> 00:23.090]  people are like, who invented the character? Anyway.
[00:25.190 --> 00:26.990]  Hey Gavin, who invented Freddy Krueger?
[00:28.650 --> 00:29.130]  Uh...
[00:29.130 --> 00:32.890]  Oh, I know this. I know this. Can I answer this? I love trivia.
[00:33.450 --> 00:33.930]  Absolutely.
[00:34.270 --> 00:36.150]  I teamed myself up. Is it Wes Craven?
[00:36.670 --> 00:36.950]  Yep.
[00:36.950 --> 00:39.290]  I said I know this. I just know. I assume it was him.
[00:39.370 --> 00:42.750]  Hey Geoff, just so you know, it's episode 104 and whatever Andrew was going to say, I was
[00:42.750 --> 00:44.450]  just going to say yes to. Go ahead whenever you're ready.
[00:44.830 --> 00:52.250]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face podcast. This is number 104, season
[00:52.250 --> 00:59.530]  four, year two, volume one. My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me as always, Gavin Free and
[00:59.530 --> 01:01.170]  a mumbling idiot named Andrew.
[01:01.330 --> 01:03.690]  Why are you talking to yourself in the intro, Andrew?
[01:03.690 --> 01:09.690]  Okay, well, two things. First of all, this is the end of year two. This is our last episode
[01:09.690 --> 01:14.290]  of year two. I realized I didn't hit record. I just hit record right now. I've not been
[01:14.290 --> 01:14.610]  recording.
[01:14.870 --> 01:15.070]  Are you kidding me?
[01:15.650 --> 01:20.350]  Well, because I was talking about a thing that I didn't part of the show, so I missed
[01:20.350 --> 01:23.830]  the... my recording did not pick up any of the background. We're talking about Freddy
[01:23.830 --> 01:27.550]  Krueger and who invented it. I was just curious. I thought it was Wes Craven. It was Wes Craven.
[01:27.990 --> 01:29.530]  According to Google and a basic search.
[01:29.930 --> 01:31.590]  What's the controversy over Freddy Krueger?
[01:31.590 --> 01:35.350]  I think it was... I don't know if there was controversy over Freddy Krueger. I remember
[01:35.350 --> 01:36.330]  there was with Jason.
[01:36.550 --> 01:38.270]  I think he's just not a very nice bloke.
[01:38.510 --> 01:40.730]  You can't be inventing Freddy Krueger drama.
[01:41.230 --> 01:46.170]  Well, it's in the same kind of mythos. Freddy Krueger and Jason are sort of the same. They
[01:46.170 --> 01:48.350]  fought each other once. Like, I feel like that's not...
[01:48.350 --> 01:52.250]  That's like saying... that's like saying me and Elon Musk are the same dude because we
[01:52.250 --> 01:52.830]  both have Twitter.
[01:53.350 --> 01:58.830]  I feel like that's not at all comparable. There was a... if you and Elon Musk were in
[01:58.830 --> 02:04.770]  the same space and you fought each other as part of a giant campaign, if you two fought,
[02:04.890 --> 02:05.890]  then it would be the same.
[02:06.190 --> 02:08.890]  Did they ever do Freddy versus Predator?
[02:09.350 --> 02:11.810]  Probably in like a comic book somewhere.
[02:12.350 --> 02:16.890]  I just feel like they need to bring the two versus movies and go against each other.
[02:17.450 --> 02:18.730]  Like the winner of each.
[02:19.310 --> 02:24.490]  That's a great... I'd be so on board for that. I watched all of the Freddy and all of the
[02:24.490 --> 02:26.650]  Jason movies because of Freddy versus Jason.
[02:27.190 --> 02:31.610]  I hadn't seen Freddy versus Jason, and I thought, like, I want to... I want all the history of
[02:31.610 --> 02:34.930]  these characters. So I watched both films to that point.
[02:35.010 --> 02:39.370]  There's like six movies on each side. If you compare versus to...
[02:39.370 --> 02:42.090]  There was way more than six Jason movies at that point. There was at least ten.
[02:42.570 --> 02:49.530]  I don't think there are... maybe. I don't know. This was a while ago. Either way, if you put
[02:49.530 --> 02:54.550]  Freddy versus Jason against any real life fight, it's the most disappointing fight I've
[02:54.550 --> 02:55.770]  ever seen. Hands down.
[02:55.770 --> 03:01.490]  I used to really want to be called Jason as a kid because I thought it was the coolest
[03:01.490 --> 03:04.090]  name because... what is it?
[03:04.170 --> 03:09.310]  July, August, September, October, November is Jason.
[03:09.650 --> 03:12.970]  I was like, man, Jasons are so lucky because of that.
[03:17.190 --> 03:18.770]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[03:18.890 --> 03:24.070]  Like if you write the first letter of every month, it spells Jason in the middle.
[03:24.070 --> 03:27.350]  That is such a classic dumb kid thing to think.
[03:27.730 --> 03:31.450]  I love that. That's insane.
[03:32.110 --> 03:35.270]  It's too bad there's no G and V months.
[03:35.650 --> 03:37.170]  Damn. Goon.
[03:39.990 --> 03:43.470]  Hey, what do you guys want to talk about today?
[03:44.050 --> 03:45.770]  We have quite a few things, I feel like.
[03:45.990 --> 03:50.670]  Should we open up with... I would like to say on the record that bagels are infinitely
[03:50.670 --> 03:51.790]  better than roller coasters.
[03:52.310 --> 03:54.310]  Roller coasters, not great, in my opinion.
[03:54.550 --> 03:56.330]  I just would like to say that on the record.
[03:56.810 --> 03:57.250]  Roller coasters?
[03:57.390 --> 03:57.650]  Definitively.
[03:57.970 --> 04:00.950]  Yeah, Jack did a whole thing because we should actually just get in.
[04:00.990 --> 04:02.430]  That's a great entry point to the...
[04:02.430 --> 04:03.130]  Yeah, we might as well.
[04:03.510 --> 04:05.590]  Tunnel of love that is known as anal passage.
[04:06.710 --> 04:11.570]  We are selling a lot of shirts, an absurd amount of shirts that I feel like has
[04:11.570 --> 04:14.230]  completely changed the narrative on what this whole bit is.
[04:14.390 --> 04:18.730]  We accidentally made the best selling shirt of the entire year.
[04:18.890 --> 04:19.370]  Is that right?
[04:19.770 --> 04:20.890]  I believe so.
[04:20.890 --> 04:22.530]  That is atrocious.
[04:23.050 --> 04:25.750]  I think it's the most profitable shirt.
[04:25.930 --> 04:28.810]  And we're like right about to cross the most sold.
[04:29.010 --> 04:31.170]  I feel genuinely bad about that one.
[04:31.550 --> 04:35.270]  Yeah, I thought we were going to sell like 20 of those things.
[04:36.370 --> 04:41.510]  We have sold hundreds upon hundreds and people keep buying them.
[04:41.970 --> 04:46.330]  But firstly, I thought we were treated like it was going to be a limited run, like
[04:46.330 --> 04:47.050]  our balls.
[04:47.910 --> 04:53.510]  Yes, secondly, who are these like 600 people who want to wear anal passage on the
[04:53.510 --> 04:56.050]  front of their shirt? Surely you can't wear that one.
[04:56.470 --> 04:59.190]  I was talking about this with Jack this morning because I had to record anal
[04:59.190 --> 05:01.710]  passage, two episodes of anal passage.
[05:01.950 --> 05:04.850]  So if I'm sitting a little weird, if I feel uncomfortable, that's why.
[05:06.230 --> 05:11.810]  And I was telling him, I was like, the only reason that shirt is even still
[05:11.810 --> 05:16.350]  around, I was going to pull it down Monday or Tuesday as soon as the episode
[05:16.350 --> 05:19.530]  came out and be like, all right, it's time to take it down now.
[05:19.610 --> 05:21.190]  We sold, you know, a hundred of them or whatever.
[05:21.470 --> 05:22.550]  The joke is on its course.
[05:22.670 --> 05:23.870]  And I just forgot to.
[05:23.930 --> 05:24.830]  I was just being lazy.
[05:24.910 --> 05:27.470]  And I was like, I got a bunch of slacks that I'll slack later.
[05:27.510 --> 05:28.550]  And then I just never did.
[05:28.750 --> 05:30.710]  And then we sold hundreds upon hundreds.
[05:30.870 --> 05:33.810]  It's an absolutely, absolutely ridiculous.
[05:34.130 --> 05:35.150]  It makes no sense.
[05:35.710 --> 05:39.550]  I know the premise was we did this and Jack's going to be annoyed by it and we'll
[05:39.550 --> 05:41.810]  remove it eventually when Jack Jack sees it.
[05:42.770 --> 05:44.990]  Respectfully, I don't think Jack's feelings matter anymore.
[05:44.990 --> 05:48.470]  It is the most profitable shirt of twenty twenty two.
[05:48.610 --> 05:50.190]  I think it just has to stay.
[05:50.370 --> 05:52.970]  Like, I think the audience is fuck Jack in a weird way.
[05:53.030 --> 05:53.550]  Yeah, no.
[05:53.630 --> 05:54.150]  Buying the shirt.
[05:54.710 --> 05:56.530]  We have just the best listeners.
[05:56.870 --> 05:58.690]  That's our next shirt is fuck Jack's feelings.
[05:58.990 --> 06:00.470]  Look for that shirt coming soon.
[06:00.750 --> 06:01.830]  It's going to sell ten thousand.
[06:03.730 --> 06:05.570]  Do a variation of it.
[06:05.730 --> 06:09.410]  The idea that in this spreadsheet, as the profit goes up, the guilt goes down.
[06:13.470 --> 06:14.230]  It does.
[06:14.230 --> 06:16.890]  Well, I mean, in just offense, I feel like you have the closest.
[06:17.070 --> 06:18.450]  You do another show with Jack.
[06:18.710 --> 06:21.010]  It's clearly out of your hands at this point.
[06:21.090 --> 06:24.730]  You would love to, I'm sure, remove a thing that he's annoyed by.
[06:24.850 --> 06:26.970]  But it's it's undeniably successful.
[06:27.470 --> 06:28.350]  It would make no sense.
[06:28.510 --> 06:30.210]  I mean, we don't have a choice out of your hands.
[06:30.230 --> 06:31.110]  Be bad business.
[06:31.510 --> 06:32.830]  It would be terrible business.
[06:33.070 --> 06:36.970]  I will say I do think it legitimately pissed him off.
[06:36.990 --> 06:37.870]  Oh, absolutely.
[06:38.290 --> 06:39.630]  That's maybe the funniest part.
[06:39.690 --> 06:40.450]  What makes you say that?
[06:41.030 --> 06:46.230]  I can tell by his demeanor when we were together that he was he was certainly
[06:46.230 --> 06:51.330]  annoyed by it and and I think I think even more annoyed by how well it sold.
[06:51.830 --> 06:53.610]  How do we make it up to him?
[06:53.830 --> 06:54.870]  Why? I don't think we have to.
[06:55.110 --> 06:57.070]  I think I don't know.
[06:57.230 --> 06:58.630]  Maybe do we get him a gift basket?
[06:59.730 --> 07:01.030]  I don't think we have to.
[07:01.190 --> 07:02.610]  We can get him one of the shirts.
[07:02.850 --> 07:04.350]  Do you think that's a great idea?
[07:05.010 --> 07:09.390]  Maybe we could get him a special one that is like a unique color, like a one of one.
[07:09.390 --> 07:14.670]  Maybe we should put together a special face guilt basket that we send to people.
[07:16.170 --> 07:17.870]  And that's a great idea.
[07:20.290 --> 07:24.030]  Oh, we should come up with a standard selection of items that was a regulation
[07:24.030 --> 07:27.070]  basket. Yeah, we'll send it to the tuxedo.
[07:27.190 --> 07:28.070]  We'll send one to Jack.
[07:28.570 --> 07:29.990]  Oh, my God, we got to do that.
[07:30.710 --> 07:32.270]  What if we also promote him?
[07:32.950 --> 07:36.430]  What if we give him like a 10 day contract back to the big leagues and he could be
[07:36.430 --> 07:41.290]  minor league or he could be major league fan Jack on a 10 day expiring contract?
[07:45.850 --> 07:49.570]  Never mind. I'm going to do that to myself for now.
[07:50.710 --> 07:53.130]  I like that, Gavin, you're like, was he really mad?
[07:53.210 --> 07:57.850]  It's like, yeah, yeah, it's it's it's a joke based off of a thing he created.
[07:58.090 --> 08:01.390]  It's like something his number one interest, it seems like, of course,
[08:01.790 --> 08:04.510]  that would be something I'd be annoyed by, like it's not.
[08:05.130 --> 08:07.130]  Obviously, he would be upset by it.
[08:07.270 --> 08:10.850]  More people bought the shirt than listen to the podcast.
[08:13.830 --> 08:15.170]  That's. That's not true.
[08:16.590 --> 08:18.430]  No, we should be clear, that's not true.
[08:19.370 --> 08:20.350]  That's not true.
[08:20.750 --> 08:22.090]  It might be close, but it's not true.
[08:22.230 --> 08:24.930]  It's not true, but it's a really funny, mean thing to say.
[08:26.030 --> 08:27.790]  OK, I couldn't stop myself.
[08:27.870 --> 08:28.930]  It's obviously not true.
[08:29.210 --> 08:31.130]  It's not true. But I had to.
[08:31.250 --> 08:32.630]  Yeah, it had to come out.
[08:32.630 --> 08:35.090]  So I couldn't I couldn't swallow that poison.
[08:35.510 --> 08:39.250]  Oh, I feel like at this point we've we've got back at Jack not showing up
[08:39.250 --> 08:43.510]  to any of the break shit multiple times over at this point.
[08:43.830 --> 08:45.490]  Yeah. Yeah.
[08:45.850 --> 08:50.530]  Also, he said he wanted to go on that, but Eric didn't send him the calendar invite.
[08:50.950 --> 08:52.270]  Dude, that is.
[08:52.430 --> 08:55.690]  I talked to Geoff about that, like when we did this break shit yesterday.
[08:55.910 --> 08:58.510]  That fucking floored me.
[08:58.830 --> 09:02.290]  I was so like, I could not believe that he said that.
[09:02.290 --> 09:03.730]  And meant it like
[09:04.930 --> 09:09.870]  he was there when we were like going to record them.
[09:10.230 --> 09:12.490]  He was there and watch just set up.
[09:12.690 --> 09:15.350]  He hung out for like the better part of half an hour.
[09:15.470 --> 09:19.310]  And then it was getting on to Showtime and he went, well, see you later.
[09:19.770 --> 09:21.290]  I'm pretty sure we talked to him.
[09:21.610 --> 09:22.990]  Yes. About. Yes.
[09:23.610 --> 09:24.850]  It wasn't a secret.
[09:25.350 --> 09:28.030]  We told him over and over that we wanted him on.
[09:28.970 --> 09:30.510]  So like, no, I will.
[09:30.590 --> 09:31.830]  I won't stand for that.
[09:31.830 --> 09:32.990]  Like, that's ridiculous.
[09:33.290 --> 09:36.250]  He did this to himself and like everything else.
[09:36.350 --> 09:39.190]  He's done it to himself and only has himself to blame.
[09:39.690 --> 09:45.070]  I feel like he texted you that he was out or he texted Geoff in one of the first ones
[09:45.070 --> 09:47.930]  that like specifically there was a reach out by.
[09:48.030 --> 09:49.610]  Oh, my God. Like he was invited.
[09:49.830 --> 09:51.750]  He was on calendar invites for the first bunch.
[09:52.050 --> 09:52.950]  And that's what I like.
[09:53.010 --> 09:56.110]  He was like a last minute scratch from the first three of them, I think.
[09:56.410 --> 10:00.150]  I will. In defense of Jack, if you don't get a calendar invite,
[10:00.150 --> 10:03.550]  but you say your invite, it doesn't it's like a it feels like a 50.
[10:03.630 --> 10:05.230]  He's had he's had calendar invites.
[10:05.450 --> 10:08.290]  But if you have a calendar invite and you do not make it, then that is its own.
[10:08.630 --> 10:09.810]  I cannot. That's not defendable.
[10:10.050 --> 10:13.030]  What happens if you don't have a calendar invite, but you're there
[10:13.030 --> 10:16.970]  as everyone's setting up and about to go live with it and you know it's happening
[10:16.970 --> 10:19.030]  and you know, you haven't made the other one.
[10:19.130 --> 10:20.890]  So the invitation is still open.
[10:21.210 --> 10:24.370]  And people are saying shit like, it'd be cool to have you on today, man.
[10:24.830 --> 10:28.670]  Yeah. If somebody says to me, I'd like for you to be on this
[10:28.670 --> 10:31.530]  or it'd be really cool for you to be on this, then that goes out the window.
[10:31.830 --> 10:35.190]  If there's just an assumption of being welcome, then I'm kind of on his side.
[10:35.370 --> 10:37.710]  In that moment, the open invite doesn't.
[10:37.830 --> 10:39.150]  It's it's a tricky thing.
[10:39.530 --> 10:41.150]  It feels fake a lot of the time.
[10:41.530 --> 10:44.130]  I would be careful to get on not to get on Eric's bad side on this one.
[10:44.170 --> 10:47.010]  He's he's I don't I don't know what it would be.
[10:47.130 --> 10:49.730]  I don't understand how it would be tricky, Jack.
[10:49.810 --> 10:50.950]  We want you on this.
[10:50.990 --> 10:52.610]  And then that blew us off three.
[10:52.710 --> 10:55.230]  Hang on. And then he blew us off three times.
[10:55.230 --> 10:59.230]  And then we just kept doing these things and going like, would be cool if you came.
[10:59.410 --> 11:01.210]  And then he was there as we were setting up.
[11:01.270 --> 11:02.130]  I'll never forget that.
[11:02.330 --> 11:04.230]  We were there. He was there as we were setting up.
[11:04.330 --> 11:08.350]  And like, oh, is he I mean, really, it was he left.
[11:08.530 --> 11:09.410]  And me and Geoff just went.
[11:10.250 --> 11:11.470]  I mean, I didn't want to say anything.
[11:11.650 --> 11:13.670]  I had to see if he was going to stick around or not.
[11:13.750 --> 11:14.450]  And he just left.
[11:14.630 --> 11:16.850]  And it was like a solution for this. Yeah.
[11:17.290 --> 11:20.690]  The next break shit, we do it from wherever Jack is.
[11:22.810 --> 11:25.250]  Like a brakeshed flash mob.
[11:29.690 --> 11:30.970]  Table with wheels.
[11:31.910 --> 11:32.890]  Behind him.
[11:33.210 --> 11:36.890]  Are they going to let us open baseball cards at Universal Studios?
[11:37.130 --> 11:38.090]  Are they going to be OK with that?
[11:40.530 --> 11:42.410]  Doing rips on a roller coaster.
[11:42.770 --> 11:44.470]  Oh, my God. Somebody write this down.
[11:44.550 --> 11:45.350]  We'll forget about that.
[11:45.890 --> 11:47.770]  Oh, that's a great idea.
[11:49.950 --> 11:57.570]  Anyway, thanks to the comment leavers and the regulation listeners, both of you, for buying that shirt and being in on that joke.
[11:57.750 --> 12:04.810]  It was a phenomenal turnout. I love this listener base more than any I've ever been a part of, I think.
[12:05.510 --> 12:13.090]  I totally agree. I completely agree. I think that we've all cultivated quite a little community together, us and them.
[12:13.690 --> 12:17.990]  Speaking of, you know, it's funny. I have my tendrils everywhere in the company.
[12:18.230 --> 12:22.790]  And so I keep up on the comments and how all the different content is doing, and I read a lot.
[12:23.270 --> 12:30.790]  And I'm seeing comment leaver and regulation listener, as a preface, all over the place, outside of our face world now.
[12:30.930 --> 12:35.370]  I'm seeing like, hey guys, comment leaver here. I guess I'm a comment leaver now. I used to be a regulation listener.
[12:35.370 --> 12:41.430]  Anyway, I really like the new episode of RWBY, and it's just like, it has no ties to the **** base at this point.
[12:42.030 --> 12:43.710]  Which is very gratifying.
[12:44.610 --> 12:49.810]  If I read somewhere, I'm a big RWBY guy, I'll be very happy. Like, that'll be the cherry on top.
[12:51.430 --> 12:55.750]  Anyway, it's become a part of the vernacular, I guess is what I'm trying to say, which I really appreciate.
[12:56.290 --> 12:58.190]  Yeah, that's awesome. It's so funny.
[12:58.910 --> 13:06.450]  Hey, I spent some time... Eric mentioned we did a break shit yesterday. We did like a mini break shit, just he and I.
[13:08.810 --> 13:14.190]  Which, by the way, everybody else is invited to. We're gonna try to get the cadence up to doing it weekly.
[13:14.350 --> 13:18.150]  And we figure we'll do like three smaller ones that are just he and I, or me and somebody else.
[13:18.310 --> 13:21.650]  And then the big monthly one with the full cast and the soundboard and everything.
[13:23.090 --> 13:24.390]  Is that okay with you, Gavin?
[13:24.850 --> 13:28.670]  Well, yeah, Andrew and I were on Halo and we were trying to decide whether we were invited to that.
[13:29.810 --> 13:32.490]  Yeah, Emily was having the same confusion as well.
[13:32.750 --> 13:35.750]  Yeah, everybody's invited. I think we were just trying to pull something like...
[13:35.750 --> 13:39.710]  It was 60 minutes, it was in and out real fast. It was like a half the set setup.
[13:40.530 --> 13:45.330]  It was more just to try to get like... Not everyone has to be like a major production.
[13:45.710 --> 13:48.450]  But anyway, and then over the weekend, I spent some time with Eric.
[13:48.450 --> 13:52.190]  We went swimming together. Or whether we went to Barton Springs together.
[13:52.890 --> 13:57.610]  Also with 10-day expiring contract Major League Fan Jack was there as well.
[13:58.010 --> 14:01.550]  And I learned something about Eric. And I was gonna see what you guys think.
[14:02.090 --> 14:04.190]  You guys know Eric, our producer, Eric Badour, right?
[14:04.570 --> 14:05.010]  Yeah.
[14:05.450 --> 14:07.930]  Yeah. That last part was a burp. That was not part of his name.
[14:08.770 --> 14:12.650]  Would you guess him to be a water guy or not a water guy?
[14:13.110 --> 14:16.790]  Hmm. Well, he's from California.
[14:18.630 --> 14:19.590]  Southern California.
[14:20.410 --> 14:24.530]  But it has water on it. So I would say he's not a water guy.
[14:25.110 --> 14:30.930]  So you think because he's from San Diego, surrounded by water, he's not a water guy.
[14:31.470 --> 14:31.670]  Yeah.
[14:32.170 --> 14:38.550]  I'm trying to figure out if rats like water. And then making a choice based upon that information.
[14:38.690 --> 14:43.890]  I'm gonna say rats are not water guys. So I'm gonna agree with Gavin. Eric's not a water guy.
[14:43.890 --> 14:49.950]  I would have pegged Eric as a water guy through and through for a lot of reasons.
[14:51.470 --> 14:53.750]  Pretty much everybody who has a mustache is a water guy.
[14:54.710 --> 14:57.930]  He's got water guy glasses. He's from San Diego.
[14:58.490 --> 14:59.470]  Always in shorts.
[15:00.130 --> 15:07.890]  He's super into wrestling. And I feel like most people that are into wrestling are into shit like four wheelers and jet skis and fun stuff like that.
[15:07.890 --> 15:14.730]  I feel like if you like wrestling, you like water. You're like Kenny Powers likes water, you like water.
[15:15.350 --> 15:20.390]  And for all these reasons and the whole San Diego of it all, I just assumed he was a water guy.
[15:20.650 --> 15:23.030]  Went to Barton Springs. Not a water guy.
[15:23.410 --> 15:24.950]  Now what does that mean exactly?
[15:25.290 --> 15:27.890]  Well, that's the thing. It's not that I'm...
[15:27.890 --> 15:34.350]  I'm not a water guy like, hey, let's jump in this really deep water and then just tread water for a long time.
[15:34.350 --> 15:37.730]  Which is what we did for a long time.
[15:37.930 --> 15:41.670]  I mean, like the water was cold and it was nine feet deep and I just kept kicking.
[15:43.250 --> 15:51.450]  When I think of going to the water or going to the beach, I like being near the water with a drink in my hand.
[15:51.690 --> 15:57.510]  And then Sublime is playing from a radio or a cover band not too far away.
[15:58.010 --> 16:01.430]  That is my ideal water scenario.
[16:01.750 --> 16:04.030]  So I'm like a near water guy.
[16:04.030 --> 16:07.430]  I'm just not necessarily... yeah, I don't like being in...
[16:07.430 --> 16:11.650]  Yeah, I just don't think I've ever been in water and gone like, ah, the right temperature.
[16:11.910 --> 16:14.590]  It's always very cold.
[16:14.990 --> 16:16.610]  And I don't like... it's tough.
[16:16.830 --> 16:19.570]  When I saw him yesterday, so we went on Sunday.
[16:19.830 --> 16:22.650]  We were all celebrating Mother's Day together, Jack and Eric and I.
[16:23.470 --> 16:24.330]  By going swimming.
[16:24.970 --> 16:26.210]  With our significant others.
[16:27.850 --> 16:31.250]  And anyway, when I saw him on Wednesday to do the break shit, he goes,
[16:31.250 --> 16:38.350]  You know what it's like when you're in the water and you can't touch the bottom and you dip down and you touch the bottom and the bottom is slimy?
[16:39.210 --> 16:40.630]  And you wonder, what is that?
[16:40.730 --> 16:41.570]  And I'm like, yeah, I guess.
[16:41.630 --> 16:44.250]  And he's like, I haven't stopped thinking about that for four days.
[16:44.530 --> 16:45.130]  Yeah, yes.
[16:45.310 --> 16:47.910]  Yeah, like the weeds and algae and all that stuff in there.
[16:48.290 --> 16:53.630]  I didn't realize how deep nine feet is until you jump in and go all the way to the bottom.
[16:53.630 --> 16:54.770]  And then it's slimy.
[16:54.910 --> 16:58.390]  And then you have to kick as hard as you can all the way up.
[16:58.390 --> 17:00.850]  And you just go like, oh, I'm never going to forget this.
[17:00.850 --> 17:01.830]  Probably as long as I live.
[17:02.250 --> 17:12.430]  I think the scariest thing to me about water that's around, like if you're in water and it's like 10 or 11 feet deep, it's just the same as it being 450 feet deep.
[17:12.730 --> 17:14.670]  It's the same level of fear.
[17:15.130 --> 17:16.750]  Absolutely agree with you.
[17:16.870 --> 17:20.590]  A hundred percent. Nine feet might as well be the Mariana Trench.
[17:20.850 --> 17:23.510]  It's all bad and I don't like it.
[17:24.250 --> 17:25.710]  Why is the depth intimidating?
[17:26.210 --> 17:30.850]  Because what's down there and also what touched me and also how do I get out of it?
[17:30.970 --> 17:33.910]  I don't and it's something could grab me at any moment.
[17:34.030 --> 17:36.190]  What the freshwater sharks?
[17:36.350 --> 17:36.910]  I don't know.
[17:37.250 --> 17:41.570]  I guess I don't I don't associate depth with those feelings or concerns.
[17:41.790 --> 17:43.190]  That is my number one concern.
[17:43.270 --> 17:47.430]  And like the ocean, what a fucking shark eats me or whatever ridiculous thought.
[17:47.530 --> 17:49.730]  But depth never comes into play.
[17:49.730 --> 17:52.690]  So that makes me question.
[17:52.950 --> 17:57.610]  Andrew, would you consider yourself a water guy, not a water guy or a near water guy?
[17:57.910 --> 17:59.890]  I am, I think, the biggest water guy.
[17:59.990 --> 18:02.110]  But I think there's different classes of water guy.
[18:02.210 --> 18:04.090]  Am I a water sports guy?
[18:04.210 --> 18:05.830]  No, I'm not a water sports guy.
[18:06.030 --> 18:07.330]  Love being in the water.
[18:07.630 --> 18:09.050]  Love being around the water.
[18:09.150 --> 18:09.710]  You love your knots?
[18:10.310 --> 18:10.850]  Don't I?
[18:11.810 --> 18:12.590]  Terrible knots.
[18:12.910 --> 18:14.270]  But I do not.
[18:14.650 --> 18:15.530]  I'm not going to ride.
[18:15.710 --> 18:18.450]  I'm not going to ride a jet ski type thing that doesn't appeal to me.
[18:18.450 --> 18:21.850]  I mean, I'm willing to, but that's not a thing I'm excited about.
[18:22.050 --> 18:26.750]  I think the only vehicle classification I'd say I get maybe excited about on the water is a kayak.
[18:27.150 --> 18:27.910]  A kayak guy.
[18:28.490 --> 18:29.170]  Love a good kayak.
[18:29.390 --> 18:34.210]  But outside of that, I'd say I'm generally an in the water guy would be my highest water ranking.
[18:34.550 --> 18:36.250]  I think that makes total sense.
[18:36.470 --> 18:39.570]  Okay, Nick, I'd like to ask you as well.
[18:39.710 --> 18:40.750]  Would you consider yourself a...
[18:40.750 --> 18:41.630]  Nick, I gotta be honest.
[18:41.770 --> 18:43.110]  You look like a big water guy to me.
[18:43.290 --> 18:44.450]  You seem like a huge water guy.
[18:44.630 --> 18:45.130]  Love water.
[18:45.350 --> 18:45.890]  I thought so.
[18:45.950 --> 18:47.170]  Big water guy. Absolutely.
[18:47.170 --> 18:49.110]  Don't get enough of it because, you know, Texas.
[18:49.570 --> 18:51.030]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:51.290 --> 18:53.810]  Well, at least I'm not losing my mind then.
[18:53.930 --> 18:55.130]  I have a question for Eric then.
[18:55.490 --> 18:56.910]  Eric, are you a hot tub guy?
[18:57.070 --> 18:58.470]  Is this a temperature issue mainly?
[18:59.070 --> 19:02.410]  Would you hop in a hot tub at every available opportunity?
[19:02.930 --> 19:06.110]  I don't know about every available opportunity, but like I have...
[19:06.110 --> 19:08.030]  I like spending time in a hot tub.
[19:08.150 --> 19:11.850]  Again, I like being near the water.
[19:11.850 --> 19:23.430]  So it... the same thing holds where if there's a hot tub and I have a drink in my hand and Sublime is on a radio or there is a cover band playing Sublime, I'm thrilled.
[19:23.690 --> 19:26.910]  I don't have to be in the water to be having a good time.
[19:27.110 --> 19:29.190]  But you wouldn't go in a nine foot deep hot tub?
[19:29.470 --> 19:32.050]  That sounds so... can you imagine?
[19:32.530 --> 19:33.550]  Oh my god.
[19:33.750 --> 19:35.390]  That's the scariest fucking thing.
[19:35.450 --> 19:37.430]  That's just all... that's like a hole.
[19:37.650 --> 19:40.450]  It's just four feet wide but nine feet down.
[19:40.450 --> 19:42.230]  Air and come up in the drown tube.
[19:42.270 --> 19:43.790]  Oh my god.
[19:44.110 --> 19:46.550]  Well, there's one way down and no ways up.
[19:47.190 --> 19:51.650]  That's like a giant stock pot from fucking... like when you see Bugs Bunny characters cooking each other.
[19:52.230 --> 19:52.750]  God damn.
[19:54.130 --> 19:57.390]  Gavin, water guy, near the water guy, not a water guy?
[19:57.790 --> 19:58.750]  Yeah, I love the water guy.
[20:00.090 --> 20:01.750]  Love the water guy?
[20:02.170 --> 20:03.390]  Big Kevin Costner fan.
[20:03.710 --> 20:03.990]  Love him.
[20:04.370 --> 20:04.870]  What a guy.
[20:05.070 --> 20:08.130]  I would say once I'm acclimatized, I can't get enough of it.
[20:08.130 --> 20:11.970]  Especially in the ocean, like being in the sea, getting pelted by the waves.
[20:12.610 --> 20:14.350]  Can we get a love the water guy shirt now?
[20:14.490 --> 20:17.650]  Yeah, I'm just imagining the water boy but it's the water guy.
[20:18.050 --> 20:25.250]  We have a tendency, even when we're joking, like I saw a bunch of people that are like, I would like a shirt haver shirt please or a shirt wearer shirt please.
[20:25.590 --> 20:31.370]  We gotta not beat that shit into the ground because I would be definitely tempted to dumb shirt my way into the poor house.
[20:31.370 --> 20:37.110]  You know what, Meg said she would absolutely buy a shirt haver slash shirt buy a shirt.
[20:37.390 --> 20:41.350]  I think shirt haver is something we probably should do.
[20:41.550 --> 20:43.310]  What if we put it on a koozie?
[20:44.210 --> 20:45.110]  I guess...
[20:45.110 --> 20:46.010]  Why?
[20:47.510 --> 20:49.770]  Why can't we just put it on a shirt?
[20:50.410 --> 20:51.050]  We can do that too.
[20:52.210 --> 20:52.950]  We can do that too.
[20:53.510 --> 20:56.550]  You want a koozie to say shirt haver?
[20:58.050 --> 20:59.170]  No, hang on.
[20:59.370 --> 21:02.670]  Typically when I have a koozie, I don't have a shirt on.
[21:02.930 --> 21:06.330]  I'm drinking near the water and there's no shirt.
[21:09.410 --> 21:11.390]  I'm just trying really hard to make koozies happen.
[21:12.070 --> 21:14.210]  You really want koozies to happen.
[21:14.270 --> 21:15.270]  We made one, didn't we?
[21:15.930 --> 21:18.250]  We had the weirdest collection.
[21:18.930 --> 21:26.030]  We had a Vancouver child kicker koozie that you could buy by itself or a pack of four that didn't have that one in it.
[21:26.030 --> 21:27.390]  It was removed from that.
[21:27.590 --> 21:34.210]  I don't know why we sold one by itself and then four as a group that didn't include one of the ones that was by itself.
[21:34.990 --> 21:35.430]  Madness.
[21:36.150 --> 21:39.290]  Yeah, I don't begin to know how to answer that question.
[21:40.090 --> 21:43.050]  I will say, I didn't have an issue.
[21:43.550 --> 21:49.710]  My premise, Gavin, my issue with your shirt haver shirt isn't that it shouldn't exist.
[21:50.070 --> 21:53.570]  It was that you framed it as in this is a market we need to cater to.
[21:53.570 --> 21:56.050]  That is the absurdity of your statement.
[21:56.150 --> 21:58.190]  I don't know how they end up on the store.
[21:58.370 --> 21:59.970]  I don't know how they find the show.
[22:00.490 --> 22:03.730]  Who is that person that you're trying to aim that product to?
[22:03.910 --> 22:06.490]  As a joke, as like a dumb thing, hilarious.
[22:07.030 --> 22:10.850]  But you treated it like you were tapping into an audience that we didn't have.
[22:12.030 --> 22:12.850]  That was my issue.
[22:15.850 --> 22:17.750]  You know, I'm mostly on your side with this.
[22:18.110 --> 22:20.190]  It seems to have a broad appeal.
[22:21.290 --> 22:22.250]  I mean, Meg likes it.
[22:23.110 --> 22:25.910]  She's neither a comment leaver or a regulation listener.
[22:26.090 --> 22:31.710]  Although, she is a comment leaver on other podcasts, which I found to be insane.
[22:32.230 --> 22:32.730]  What?
[22:33.150 --> 22:36.350]  She's left comments on other podcasts.
[22:36.870 --> 22:39.050]  So she's a comment leaver, but just not for us.
[22:39.630 --> 22:42.110]  I don't know if I should be offended or what.
[22:42.370 --> 22:43.290]  That's interesting.
[22:44.510 --> 22:47.250]  I do feel like shirt haver is a...
[22:47.250 --> 22:48.330]  Well, why doesn't she leave...
[22:48.330 --> 22:49.230]  Okay.
[22:49.230 --> 22:50.970]  What podcast?
[22:53.710 --> 22:56.570]  Do you feel comfortable saying it on our podcast?
[22:57.390 --> 22:59.410]  Yeah, I think it was the last podcast on the left.
[22:59.790 --> 23:00.690]  I don't like them anymore.
[23:00.970 --> 23:02.050]  Or maybe the dollop.
[23:02.470 --> 23:03.410]  I don't like them anymore.
[23:03.470 --> 23:04.010]  Those are her main go-tos.
[23:04.510 --> 23:06.190]  You want Meg to listen to this?
[23:06.910 --> 23:09.050]  Oh, I'm totally happy with her never listening to this.
[23:09.530 --> 23:10.630]  That's how I feel.
[23:10.990 --> 23:15.790]  I think about the discomfort it could cause Gavin.
[23:16.330 --> 23:17.770]  And that feels like an opportunity.
[23:17.770 --> 23:21.950]  My main thing is that I really enjoy telling her the highlights of it.
[23:22.190 --> 23:23.570]  I really enjoy filling her in.
[23:23.690 --> 23:25.470]  If she's like, yeah, I know.
[23:25.830 --> 23:26.890]  Then it's not...
[23:26.890 --> 23:31.730]  I will say it makes dinners more fun because we always have a lot to talk about.
[23:32.230 --> 23:32.410]  Yeah.
[23:32.850 --> 23:33.070]  Yeah.
[23:34.370 --> 23:39.170]  I do think a shirt haver is a funnier shirt than an anal passage shirt, for sure.
[23:39.910 --> 23:41.290]  We gotta pull that down at some point.
[23:41.330 --> 23:42.130]  Maybe it's already down.
[23:42.230 --> 23:43.230]  No, we don't.
[23:43.350 --> 23:44.130]  Just leave it up forever.
[23:44.930 --> 23:45.870]  Leave it up forever.
[23:46.450 --> 23:47.330]  It's not our fault.
[23:47.330 --> 23:51.250]  I guess it is probably the best-selling F*** Face shirt of all time.
[23:51.290 --> 23:53.190]  It's the best shirt of the year.
[23:53.370 --> 23:54.490]  It's not even F*** Face.
[23:54.710 --> 23:55.970]  You can't pull it down.
[23:56.110 --> 23:57.390]  I'd love to, but it'd be dumb.
[23:57.390 --> 24:01.350]  I'm so happy and I'm so annoyed as well because it's not our best shirt.
[24:01.850 --> 24:03.050]  No, no, no.
[24:03.250 --> 24:04.650]  We've made some killer stuff.
[24:05.150 --> 24:07.670]  It's not even as funny as the other Jack shirt we made.
[24:09.370 --> 24:10.610]  The bald Jack shirt.
[24:11.210 --> 24:12.850]  Yeah, we made some really good stuff.
[24:14.190 --> 24:16.750]  It's also a parody of a parody.
[24:17.310 --> 24:17.830]  Yeah.
[24:18.830 --> 24:22.950]  It's the Universal Studios logo that says annual pass.
[24:23.090 --> 24:27.310]  And then we made a shirt that said anal passage.
[24:27.630 --> 24:30.130]  So really, it's like we're putting a hat on a hat here.
[24:30.530 --> 24:31.550]  People love it, man.
[24:33.810 --> 24:37.770]  Maybe we should only modify that shirt.
[24:37.950 --> 24:42.030]  We should just come up with what comes after anal passage, but we always put it in that design.
[24:44.190 --> 24:46.450]  You'll be able to see all our shirts slowly evolve.
[24:49.630 --> 24:57.270]  Hey, I caught myself doing one of the dumber things I've ever done, maybe in my life, last night.
[24:57.830 --> 24:59.470]  And here's the thing.
[24:59.930 --> 25:02.930]  I'm afraid I've been doing it for a couple weeks now and not realizing it.
[25:03.710 --> 25:04.350]  Oh, I can't wait.
[25:04.810 --> 25:05.670]  This is incredible.
[25:07.510 --> 25:18.910]  I'll start off by saying, you know, I kind of flutter between an agnostic and atheist in terms of my religious beliefs.
[25:19.570 --> 25:21.910]  And it is honestly something I think about.
[25:22.430 --> 25:24.590]  The closer to death you get, the more you think about it.
[25:24.610 --> 25:29.250]  The older I get, I find the more I think about this stuff, which is why I kind of bounce around between the two.
[25:29.250 --> 25:34.170]  But on occasion, I will pray at the end of the day, like in bed.
[25:36.170 --> 25:39.130]  Sometimes you just do it because you did it as a kid and you don't even realize you're doing it.
[25:39.330 --> 25:42.010]  And then I'll catch myself...
[25:42.510 --> 25:45.170]  When you're a kid, you have a pray mantra that you just say the same thing over and over.
[25:45.170 --> 25:46.630]  I'll catch myself praying for people that are dead.
[25:46.910 --> 25:48.770]  And I'm like, oh wait, my grandpa died 10 years ago.
[25:48.930 --> 25:49.650]  Stop praying for him.
[25:51.110 --> 25:52.890]  And I don't do it very often, just on occasion.
[25:53.170 --> 25:57.670]  But I have an extended family member who is going through an illness right now.
[25:57.670 --> 25:59.890]  And so he's been on my mind a lot.
[25:59.970 --> 26:03.990]  And so I've been thinking, whether it's bullshit or not, I'm going to put some good out in the world.
[26:04.110 --> 26:05.270]  Put some positive energy out there.
[26:05.350 --> 26:11.710]  So each night for the last couple of weeks, I've been praying that his treatment goes well.
[26:12.390 --> 26:14.010]  And I was doing it last night.
[26:14.090 --> 26:17.730]  And as I was doing it last night, I realized I was saying, dear Alexa.
[26:18.150 --> 26:20.230]  I was praying to Alexa in my head.
[26:20.790 --> 26:24.870]  And now I realize I'm pretty sure I've been saying Alexa this whole time.
[26:25.330 --> 26:26.910]  I'm pretty sure I've been praying to Alexa.
[26:26.910 --> 26:27.570]  Why?
[26:28.430 --> 26:29.610]  I don't know.
[26:29.730 --> 26:34.130]  I don't know, because I say hey Alexa a lot to talk to the robot in the house.
[26:34.470 --> 26:35.010]  What?
[26:36.190 --> 26:41.310]  So your brain is processing like you're leaving a note.
[26:41.510 --> 26:44.570]  Like you're talking to your automated device or whatever.
[26:46.310 --> 26:53.150]  You're so used to when you're doing a task to say Alexa first that it is now entered into your prayer.
[26:53.630 --> 26:54.330]  Yeah, 100%.
[26:54.330 --> 27:01.350]  I talk to Alexa more in the day than anybody else.
[27:02.830 --> 27:04.870]  My whole house is automated by Alexa.
[27:05.250 --> 27:06.610]  So we communicate constantly.
[27:07.210 --> 27:10.530]  And I think at night, I just have been going like...
[27:10.530 --> 27:13.890]  Because I caught myself doing it last night and I went, this doesn't feel like the first time I've done this.
[27:13.890 --> 27:14.810]  This felt way too familiar.
[27:15.350 --> 27:21.750]  I was just like, dear Alexa, please look after Millie and Emily and my mom and my grandma.
[27:22.530 --> 27:25.210]  Hey Alexa, full of grace, the Lord is with you.
[27:25.490 --> 27:26.610]  Yeah, I don't say it like that.
[27:27.830 --> 27:29.790]  It's always just like, dear Lord, you know.
[27:29.870 --> 27:31.850]  But I guess I've been saying dear Alexa or hey Alexa.
[27:32.870 --> 27:34.810]  Hey Alexa, open channels to God.
[27:40.250 --> 27:44.490]  I'm picturing you calling out to Heimdall to open the Blue Bifrost.
[27:48.150 --> 27:49.890]  Anyway, when I realized I did it,
[27:49.890 --> 27:53.790]  I had to get up and go to my phone and write the fucking note down.
[27:53.890 --> 27:56.610]  So I left my phone in the other room because I couldn't believe it.
[27:56.710 --> 27:58.350]  Do you have an Alexa in that room?
[27:58.790 --> 27:59.070]  Yeah.
[27:59.430 --> 28:01.190]  I wonder if it's picked up on any of that.
[28:01.230 --> 28:04.390]  I wonder if you go into your app, does it just have a load of prayer?
[28:04.690 --> 28:06.230]  Well, I don't pray out loud.
[28:06.490 --> 28:09.810]  It's not like I'm sitting with my knees at the bed praying.
[28:09.950 --> 28:11.210]  It's just like laying in bed on the pillow.
[28:11.250 --> 28:13.870]  And Alexa can't yet read your thoughts, so that's probably fine.
[28:14.330 --> 28:16.270]  To my knowledge, she does not currently read my thoughts.
[28:16.270 --> 28:22.330]  If this is happening with your prayer, this has to be happening in other areas, too.
[28:22.550 --> 28:24.390]  I'm just curious to what extent...
[28:24.790 --> 28:28.030]  Hey, Alexa has gone undetected by you.
[28:28.330 --> 28:34.270]  Oh, I mean, I definitely call my girlfriend and my daughter Alexa.
[28:36.770 --> 28:40.130]  Not every day, but more than once a week, probably.
[28:40.290 --> 28:40.570]  What?
[28:41.010 --> 28:41.390]  For sure.
[28:41.430 --> 28:44.470]  This podcast will be a nightmare for people playing it.
[28:44.470 --> 28:45.990]  I don't think that works anymore.
[28:46.370 --> 28:47.090]  It doesn't?
[28:47.630 --> 28:48.970]  I don't know, I think they fixed that somehow.
[28:49.490 --> 28:53.790]  Because it comes up in TV commercials and TV shows all the time, and it never triggers mine.
[28:54.550 --> 28:55.210]  Huh. Alright.
[28:56.670 --> 29:02.510]  This is so... it's like you have a deeper connection with Alexa than fucking Walking Phoenix and Her.
[29:03.090 --> 29:08.110]  You have this long-standing... you and Alexa, your best bud, Alexa.
[29:08.730 --> 29:14.370]  I will say, my girlfriend thinks that Alexa is noticeably nicer to me than her, and she is annoyed by it.
[29:14.370 --> 29:18.390]  But I'm very friendly to Alexa, so it makes sense that she would be friendly to me.
[29:18.510 --> 29:22.550]  I mean, be careful. Eventually, Alexa, Google Home, and Siri will all get together and leave.
[29:24.790 --> 29:29.050]  Well, I have nothing to do with Google Home or Siri. I'm an Alexa man.
[29:29.070 --> 29:30.350]  You don't fuck with Google Home?
[29:30.610 --> 29:35.390]  I don't fuck with Google Home. I know where my bread is buttered. It's buttered by Alexa.
[29:36.710 --> 29:43.350]  Anyway, I can't be the only person on Earth that's done this. Surely somebody else has done that.
[29:43.350 --> 29:51.270]  I mean, statistically, maybe, but not... I mean, that's a wild... that's an insane thing to do, Geoff.
[29:51.830 --> 29:55.490]  And I love it. I'm proud of you for sharing that.
[29:56.030 --> 30:04.310]  Hey, Alexa, what a fucking... and it... it's like the most personal thoughts, and you've tied it to Geoff Bezos.
[30:05.090 --> 30:11.810]  Alexa is the name that I say the most in the world when I shout out to the world when I want to speak to an inanimate object.
[30:11.810 --> 30:17.110]  So at night, when I'm half asleep and I'm speaking to the other inanimate object, I just got the names flipped.
[30:18.490 --> 30:26.530]  Sure. I guess it's logical, but it's just a wild mistake to make. I'm glad you noticed it.
[30:26.910 --> 30:28.750]  Yeah, I just wonder how long I've been doing it for.
[30:29.650 --> 30:31.330]  Oh, man. I love that so much.
[30:31.730 --> 30:32.890]  Just that it's all internal.
[30:33.850 --> 30:35.450]  Oh, 100% internal to it, yeah.
[30:39.830 --> 30:45.450]  With all the busyness that comes from day-to-day life, it can be tough to find time to focus on what really matters.
[30:45.830 --> 30:47.290]  Especially if you're running a business.
[30:47.850 --> 30:49.890]  When you run a business, time seems more precious.
[30:50.450 --> 30:56.590]  Every misplaced moment feels like a missed opportunity, a lost chance to make your business better, or even just a step away in recharge.
[30:57.230 --> 31:00.770]  ShipStation gives e-commerce sellers like you more time to do what they really love.
[31:01.090 --> 31:04.750]  Unless what you really love is managing every single little detail of order fulfillment.
[31:04.750 --> 31:10.670]  ShipStation automates time-intensive shipping processes so you can get back to focusing on bigger things,
[31:10.770 --> 31:15.070]  like developing new products, honing your marketing strategy, or interacting with customers.
[31:15.530 --> 31:18.790]  No wonder ShipStation is already trusted by over 100,000 sellers.
[31:19.390 --> 31:23.810]  With all the time I would save from ShipStation, I could dig so many beanholes it would be fantastic.
[31:24.330 --> 31:26.530]  All those manual shipping tasks eating up your time?
[31:26.950 --> 31:28.530]  ShipStation is really good at those.
[31:28.530 --> 31:34.470]  So let ShipStation handle all your shipping and handling, and get back to what you're good at, growing your business.

[32:23.770 --> 32:25.670]  This podcast is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[32:26.070 --> 32:29.650]  Life can be overwhelming and many people are burned out without even knowing it.
[32:30.030 --> 32:35.830]  Symptoms can include lack of motivation, feeling helpless or trapped, detachment, fatigue, and more.
[32:35.830 --> 32:43.390]  I have experienced burnout quite a few times in life for all sorts of reasons, whether it be personal or work.
[32:43.990 --> 32:48.730]  It can be really exhausting and it's just, it's tough. It's tough to do anything.
[32:48.730 --> 32:52.970]  And then that can kind of snowball into a bunch of other issues, at least in my experience.
[32:53.330 --> 32:56.190]  We associate burnout with work, but that's not the only cause.
[32:56.350 --> 32:59.030]  Any of our roles in life can lead us to feel burned out.
[32:59.450 --> 33:02.750]  And BetterHelp Online Therapy wants to remind you to prioritize yourself.
[33:02.750 --> 33:06.030]  Talking with someone can help you figure out what's causing stress in your life.
[33:06.650 --> 33:09.070]  Therapy is something that has been incredibly helpful to me.
[33:09.310 --> 33:11.810]  I mention it every time I do these ads.
[33:12.230 --> 33:15.910]  I had a lot of different issues happening in my personal life.
[33:16.530 --> 33:29.570]  I struggled with finding people to talk to and just being able to regularly discuss things that were going on really helped me unpack certain issues as well as just discover ways that I was being impacted that I didn't even realize.
[33:29.570 --> 33:32.570]  So if you're considering therapy, I would highly recommend it.
[33:32.830 --> 33:36.270]  It's something that has made a tremendous impact on my life.
[33:36.850 --> 33:41.690]  BetterHelp is customized online therapy that offers video, phone, and even live chat sessions with your therapist.
[33:41.690 --> 33:44.350]  So you don't have to see anyone on camera if you don't want to.

[34:01.130 --> 34:03.170]  I have a... I have a thing.
[34:03.750 --> 34:03.950]  Okay.
[34:06.050 --> 34:06.570]  Paste?
[34:07.810 --> 34:10.550]  Oh boy, I'm excited for this.
[34:11.910 --> 34:13.230]  Oh, Geoff, what's that?
[34:14.150 --> 34:15.190]  What does that look like, Geoff?
[34:15.190 --> 34:17.170]  So you need to... you need to tee this up.
[34:17.770 --> 34:19.590]  For the people that are just listening.
[34:19.590 --> 34:21.010]  It's like a video game clip.
[34:21.750 --> 34:22.770]  Video game clip.
[34:23.410 --> 34:26.610]  What game would you say that is, based off of the thumbnail that you're looking at, Geoff?
[34:26.910 --> 34:27.750]  Uh, hold on.
[34:28.510 --> 34:29.150]  Looks like Halo.
[34:29.710 --> 34:30.450]  Looks like Halo.
[34:30.930 --> 34:31.250]  Okay.
[34:33.750 --> 34:35.050]  Somebody took the lead.
[34:35.430 --> 34:38.470]  Can't really read it. Is it...
[34:38.470 --> 34:38.870]  Huh.
[34:40.730 --> 34:41.910]  I don't know. I don't know what I'm looking at.
[34:42.250 --> 34:44.210]  We're not a Halo podcast, so why am I looking at this?
[34:44.210 --> 35:01.030]  Well, what it might be, instead of a 13 year old 240p clip of my overkill, it might be a 4K remastered, all five views, full game video to prove my innocence to you damn skeptics.
[35:01.650 --> 35:05.410]  Are you, uh, are you still on that? Didn't we move on from that forever ago?
[35:06.190 --> 35:06.770]  Yeah, we did.
[35:06.770 --> 35:09.530]  I found my old original...
[35:09.530 --> 35:17.250]  I was looking for an Oblivion save, because I wanted to try and complete Oblivion, uh, was it 16 years after I put it down?
[35:17.530 --> 35:23.490]  And I found, on that same Xbox, my original overkill clip. The full clip.
[35:23.950 --> 35:27.910]  So now, that's the final piece of evidence I need to put out there.
[35:28.550 --> 35:33.850]  So does this, uh, does this exonerate you or prove your guilt? I can't even remember which way I went.
[35:34.110 --> 35:34.890]  I'll let you be the judge.
[35:38.990 --> 35:40.270]  It's such a great Geoff move.
[35:41.190 --> 35:50.990]  No, I just respect the move by you. You were so anti, he's cheated, he cheated, you're in the know, like, you're denying all evidence, and then everything's brought forward and you couldn't care less.
[35:51.230 --> 35:56.090]  Here's the thing, Geoff has known, Geoff has known since the day it happened that I did it for real.
[35:56.730 --> 35:59.310]  And, uh, and I know that for a fact.
[35:59.310 --> 36:04.430]  But now, now this is, now he cannot doubt it.
[36:04.890 --> 36:10.530]  I guess, uh, I mean, doesn't the video show the same shit that happened last time?
[36:11.070 --> 36:12.810]  Well, you can actually see it this time.
[36:13.070 --> 36:16.710]  Now you can see it, you can see everyone else in the game fighting the entire game.
[36:17.370 --> 36:26.670]  You see every perspective, the events that lead to the overkill. I feel like this is pretty damning, we can officially close the book on if Gavin cheated or not, I think this is definitive evidence.
[36:26.670 --> 36:34.910]  I'll say this, I'll say this, it's either evidence that he did it, or evidence that Gavin is a really good director, which we've known for a very long time.
[36:35.550 --> 36:36.650]  I don't, I don't know if I...
[36:36.650 --> 36:39.830]  Do you think I found the same people and got them to pop it out the same?
[36:40.610 --> 36:42.610]  No, I think you could have been directing them in the moment.
[36:43.250 --> 36:43.650]  Oh.
[36:45.030 --> 36:46.970]  Well, Nick's got a good point, I didn't even hire a lawyer.
[36:47.510 --> 36:55.470]  You would know, uh, you would know that you would need to do some work to make it look legitimate for Bernie and I to believe you.
[36:55.990 --> 37:02.470]  And so, but you know, at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter. You cheated, or maybe you didn't, I don't know.
[37:02.750 --> 37:03.170]  Yeah, maybe.
[37:03.650 --> 37:04.530]  A hundred years ago.
[37:04.650 --> 37:05.330]  Maybe I didn't.
[37:05.890 --> 37:06.650]  Maybe, I don't know.
[37:08.870 --> 37:11.910]  Well, I'm just putting it to bed. I'm just finalizing that storyline.
[37:12.330 --> 37:19.350]  Yeah, I think you put it to bed, you pulled it, you woke it up and brought it out of bed and took it into the living room and then made it talk for a little bit and now you're putting it back to bed.
[37:19.350 --> 37:25.110]  No, but now it's fully to bed. It was nodding off the last time we talked about it.
[37:25.490 --> 37:31.870]  It was left and I think there was still some wiggle room. I agree with Gavin, this is now definitively, the case is done.
[37:32.270 --> 37:37.070]  And we can move on to other Halo things. This isn't the only Halo thing we have to talk about.
[37:37.510 --> 37:41.630]  Gavin and I have been playing a little bit of Halo recently.
[37:41.630 --> 37:52.310]  I'm going to send you a clip, Geoff. I guess I'll upload it in our Slack. I will also upload these to, maybe I'll give a link on the Twitter account so people can watch these.
[37:52.550 --> 37:56.050]  Can I, do I have to actually watch it or can I pretend to watch it like the last one?
[37:56.270 --> 37:57.950]  You have to actually watch this one.
[37:58.310 --> 37:58.690]  Okay.
[37:59.090 --> 38:07.970]  But it's only like 12 seconds. So I'm going to send you a clip and I want you to tell me, based off of this clip, what do you think is happening here?
[38:07.970 --> 38:12.330]  And then I'll give you another clip after that, after you make a quick little guess.
[38:12.650 --> 38:15.810]  I'll have these up on the Twitter in some capacity so people can look at them.
[38:16.010 --> 38:16.530]  Here we go.
[38:17.330 --> 38:18.610]  Appears to be Halo.
[38:21.390 --> 38:23.090]  What the fuck just happened?
[38:24.130 --> 38:26.730]  So what would you guess happened based off of that clip?
[38:27.630 --> 38:30.070]  I think somebody shot somebody in the back of the head maybe?
[38:30.750 --> 38:31.890]  What am I supposed to see here?
[38:32.310 --> 38:38.250]  I was just curious what you think is going on. I'm going to send you another clip and you can make another guess as to what's happening.
[38:38.370 --> 38:42.890]  This is the second clip, also Halo, also very brief. We'll be up in the Slack in a moment. It is now up again.
[38:43.750 --> 38:48.690]  And then once you make this guess, we will go into, I think, the story of what is actually going on.
[38:49.650 --> 38:52.050]  So what would you say is happening based on that clip?
[38:53.530 --> 38:59.770]  Oh, I think maybe somebody's dropped their controller or they've got a rubber banded or something.
[38:59.970 --> 39:02.930]  Because they're just shooting in circles and running around looking like an idiot.
[39:03.410 --> 39:06.190]  So the clip is somebody shooting in circles running like an idiot.
[39:07.430 --> 39:13.430]  A few days ago, maybe like a week at this point, Gavin and I were playing Halo and somehow the topic came up
[39:13.870 --> 39:20.970]  about how hard it would be to get a kill in Tactical Slayer, which used to be SWAT, is now Tactical Slayer, blindfolded.
[39:20.970 --> 39:25.950]  How long would it take? How many games would it be? Is this a thing we could do, potentially?
[39:26.790 --> 39:31.530]  And I brought up, because Tactical Slayer now has a bunch of different guns within it, one of them being the Mangler.
[39:32.070 --> 39:34.950]  I was like, I think the Mangler would be toughest to do.
[39:35.390 --> 39:39.010]  Gavin said, I'll give you a thousand dollars if you can get a blindfolded Mangler kill.
[39:39.510 --> 39:45.070]  So we have been playing blind Halo Infinite, like one game, whatever we play.
[39:45.070 --> 39:51.270]  The first one we did, we load in. It's so funny to play Halo with only sound as your context,
[39:51.730 --> 39:56.890]  like trying to guess what level you are on based on what the floor sounds like, and how you're moving around,
[39:57.230 --> 40:00.750]  and trying to chase sound, and having no concept of what you're doing.
[40:01.230 --> 40:06.330]  So we played through our first game, and we both took our blindfolds off, and we had zero kills.
[40:06.490 --> 40:08.390]  We had zero of everything. We did absolutely nothing.
[40:08.710 --> 40:09.910]  I think I went 0 in 16.
[40:11.410 --> 40:15.730]  Yeah, he was like 0 in 16, I was like 0 in 18. It was bad. We're terrible.
[40:16.450 --> 40:21.270]  In Halo Infinite, there is a box that people can use to type and send messages to.
[40:21.850 --> 40:23.950]  What I first noticed was we didn't have any score.
[40:24.270 --> 40:28.270]  The second thing I noticed is that box was filled with text.
[40:28.710 --> 40:30.710]  And that's something you don't typically see.
[40:31.270 --> 40:36.690]  We had no idea. Our team hated us, to the point in which they were talking about it in the chat.
[40:36.690 --> 40:39.430]  As soon as we started, somebody was like,
[40:39.690 --> 40:42.930]  What are these fucking assholes doing? They're useless.
[40:43.750 --> 40:46.330]  And then I think someone from the other team replied,
[40:46.590 --> 40:49.490]  Hey, it's just a video game, man. Be cool.
[40:50.130 --> 40:53.270]  And then they saw that we just kept running in the walls, and they're like,
[40:53.330 --> 40:55.770]  No, these guys suck. Fuck these guys.
[40:56.150 --> 41:01.290]  We united the rest of our team and the other team into hating us,
[41:01.530 --> 41:05.010]  and they all reported us for, I guess, poor sportsmanship.
[41:05.430 --> 41:08.230]  Everyone was so mad at us. That was our first game.
[41:08.410 --> 41:11.270]  We deserved it. We did, but we were just having fun.
[41:11.490 --> 41:14.390]  It was goofy, and it's not ranked. It doesn't really matter.
[41:14.830 --> 41:18.070]  You were like, Oh, maybe we gotta kill. I think I hurt somebody. Maybe I hit someone.
[41:18.490 --> 41:25.170]  So to take the blindfold off and just see rage from everybody in the game aimed at us was very funny.
[41:25.870 --> 41:29.830]  We did the second game. The first clip you saw, Geoff, which was running,
[41:30.350 --> 41:33.810]  was me running into a wall and then running off the back of the map.
[41:33.810 --> 41:40.290]  And I ran off the back of the map, fell in the water, and I distinctly remember saying to Gavin,
[41:40.630 --> 41:44.110]  I found a river. What level has a river in it?
[41:44.350 --> 41:49.010]  The thing is, at the beginning, we don't even know which map we're on, so we can't even visualize where we are.
[41:49.430 --> 41:54.370]  I see. So what you guys are saying here is the other clip from 20 years ago,
[41:54.790 --> 41:58.110]  when Gavin got the overkill, everybody else was blindfolded.
[41:58.270 --> 41:59.530]  I don't think that's what we're saying.
[41:59.530 --> 42:04.970]  Now you tied it together, it all makes sense. So did you guys ever get a kill?
[42:05.170 --> 42:09.510]  Well, I have one more clip to show you. I'll put it in the slack.
[42:10.110 --> 42:15.390]  So I was very confident that I hit somebody, but I wasn't sure if it was a teammate or not,
[42:15.750 --> 42:20.530]  or what exactly was going on. So this is a clip. I couldn't believe it.
[42:20.590 --> 42:23.910]  At the end of the second game, took off the blindfold, I had one kill,
[42:24.270 --> 42:28.170]  and I immediately had to see how in the fuck did this happen.
[42:28.670 --> 42:32.590]  I was going to do a thing in my head. I thought about doing...
[42:32.990 --> 42:36.970]  Eris is great for an audio podcast for sure. We can fucking edit it. What are you talking about?
[42:37.210 --> 42:39.150]  That's an insane statement to make.
[42:39.750 --> 42:41.590]  Oh, you meleeed somebody in the back of the head.
[42:41.930 --> 42:45.690]  I meleeed someone in the back of the head. I got a kill blindfolded in our second game.
[42:45.790 --> 42:48.430]  I thought about doing a thing on our Twitch account of being like,
[42:48.470 --> 42:54.830]  I'm going to stream a blind game of Halo Infinite every day. It'll take a year or whatever for me to actually get a kill.
[42:54.830 --> 42:59.290]  It happened in the second game, and I was so excited and disappointed.
[42:59.810 --> 43:02.810]  The second clip that I showed you, Geoff, actually has the kill in it.
[43:03.070 --> 43:07.950]  Somehow blindfolded, Gavin and I worked together where he was shooting blindly in a field,
[43:08.110 --> 43:10.710]  just spinning in a circle, and that distracted people.
[43:10.930 --> 43:14.410]  And I happened to run up and hit one of them in the back while running forward.
[43:14.950 --> 43:17.190]  So it was a combined duo blind kill.
[43:17.350 --> 43:23.150]  It was amazing how much better we got at figuring out where we were in relation to each other.
[43:23.150 --> 43:27.650]  Just going on sound, like steering towards the fight based on just stereo hearing.
[43:27.870 --> 43:31.610]  And we were using gunshots to try and identify where each other were.
[43:31.690 --> 43:34.590]  And sometimes we could hear each other meleeing at walls.
[43:35.290 --> 43:38.930]  We actually got a lot better than we did in the second game than the first game.
[43:39.150 --> 43:43.790]  There was a lot of growth. It was distinguishing when you're hitting a wall and what that sounds like,
[43:43.890 --> 43:48.370]  and then knowing I gotta move. But it's insane to me that we pulled this off within two games.
[43:49.430 --> 43:50.810]  Sadly, it was not a Mangler kill.
[43:50.810 --> 43:52.930]  So where are you going to take it from here?
[43:53.170 --> 43:56.150]  That's a great question. I haven't thought about it that much.
[43:56.490 --> 44:04.050]  What if you guys stream it on Twitch or whatever you talked about for a year and try to get a combined 117 kills?
[44:04.750 --> 44:09.110]  Why 117? Just 117 because Master Chief? Is that the idea?
[44:09.590 --> 44:10.210]  That was the idea.
[44:11.250 --> 44:16.490]  Because I don't know... I've never played a game actually blind.
[44:16.870 --> 44:21.110]  And I assume there's a lot of games that are playable as a blind person.
[44:21.390 --> 44:25.090]  But I can't imagine an FPS... is there a way that that's done, typically?
[44:26.050 --> 44:31.510]  I'm not sure. With accessibility, it seems like still a long ways to go in games,
[44:31.550 --> 44:35.550]  but it feels like there have been certain games at least that have made more of an effort in that direction.
[44:36.210 --> 44:39.970]  I'm not sure what it's like to play an FPS purely blind.
[44:39.970 --> 44:44.070]  I know there are things in games like Punch-Out.
[44:44.490 --> 44:49.410]  Punch-Out has a really big blind speedrunning community which is fucking crazy to watch.
[44:49.790 --> 44:53.210]  It's really interesting to see people just knowing how to move based on sound.
[44:53.710 --> 44:59.710]  Yeah, I watched a whole Super Mario 64 speedrun that was blindfolded and it was utterly insane.
[44:59.870 --> 45:04.550]  Like running into walls to line up against other jumps and stuff. It's pretty mental stuff.
[45:04.950 --> 45:05.350]  It's very interesting.
[45:05.370 --> 45:08.350]  It's incredible. Yeah, what people can pull off.
[45:08.370 --> 45:09.230]  Like lots of sound cues.
[45:09.230 --> 45:12.670]  People are capable of so much more than we'll ever achieve.
[45:13.430 --> 45:16.230]  Oh, absolutely. Yeah, undeniable.
[45:17.010 --> 45:19.250]  It's impressive. Everybody but us is really impressive.
[45:21.930 --> 45:23.350]  I saw Andrew's beard.
[45:23.870 --> 45:24.930]  Oh shit, how was it?
[45:25.350 --> 45:26.670]  It's actually a really good beard.
[45:26.890 --> 45:27.790]  Yeah, he wasn't lying about that.
[45:28.090 --> 45:29.650]  Oh man, I want to see his beard.
[45:29.910 --> 45:30.210]  Decent.
[45:30.830 --> 45:33.470]  I could text you because we both...
[45:34.130 --> 45:37.410]  We were just texting each other pictures of our blindfolds.
[45:37.410 --> 45:39.410]  So I basically saw his chin.
[45:41.990 --> 45:45.650]  And then I realized it's the first time I've seen Andrew since we started F***face.
[45:47.490 --> 45:48.530]  It was so weird.
[45:49.070 --> 45:49.770]  It is strange.
[45:50.010 --> 45:57.150]  I don't think I've seen you guys since 2018 or 19 at this point, which is hard to believe.
[45:57.350 --> 45:59.710]  Hard to wrap the brain around.
[46:00.230 --> 46:02.670]  But that will end soon with November.
[46:03.170 --> 46:04.230]  Are you going to stop talking to us?
[46:04.690 --> 46:06.110]  No. No, November.
[46:07.230 --> 46:08.490]  In November, apparently.
[46:08.630 --> 46:11.850]  Yeah, there's a bunch of side bets on whether you're going to show up or not.
[46:12.230 --> 46:13.890]  Oh, I know. I have written them down.
[46:14.110 --> 46:15.370]  I'm keeping a list.
[46:15.730 --> 46:16.930]  I'm aware of what's going on.
[46:17.030 --> 46:18.310]  Jack is going to owe me $20.
[46:19.610 --> 46:20.870]  You know what I'm going to do with that $20?
[46:21.150 --> 46:23.930]  I'm going to invest it in a wonderful anal passage shirt.
[46:24.010 --> 46:25.090]  One of my favorite shirts.
[46:25.310 --> 46:25.950]  Great product.
[46:26.750 --> 46:27.850]  From Jack directly.
[46:28.850 --> 46:29.970]  I can't wait for Vegas.
[46:31.810 --> 46:32.930]  I was bringing this up.
[46:32.990 --> 46:34.750]  I'd love to hear your take on this.
[46:34.750 --> 46:38.010]  Because you're way more of a music guy, Geoff, than I am.
[46:38.330 --> 46:39.270]  Same with you, Eric.
[46:39.330 --> 46:41.270]  I feel like you know quite a bit about music.
[46:41.530 --> 46:46.170]  Is every song that has a spelling sequence in it a banger?
[46:47.850 --> 46:50.090]  I was listening to Respect.
[46:50.870 --> 46:52.750]  And I was like, this is a great fucking song.
[46:52.910 --> 46:54.970]  Everyone loves the part where you spell out respect.
[46:55.810 --> 47:01.190]  And then I started thinking about every song I could think of that has a sequence in it in which they spell something.
[47:01.330 --> 47:02.810]  It's fucking great.
[47:02.810 --> 47:04.350]  I love all those songs.
[47:04.430 --> 47:04.990]  Give me another one.
[47:05.050 --> 47:05.590]  What's another option?
[47:06.150 --> 47:06.590]  Bananas.
[47:06.870 --> 47:08.730]  B-A-N-A-N-A-S.
[47:08.910 --> 47:10.070]  This shit is bananas.
[47:10.330 --> 47:11.310]  B-A-N-A-N-A-S.
[47:11.350 --> 47:11.810]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:12.470 --> 47:13.170]  This isn't...
[47:13.170 --> 47:14.150]  Well, those are the only two.
[47:14.490 --> 47:14.950]  Well, no.
[47:15.050 --> 47:15.450]  There's way more.
[47:16.850 --> 47:19.490]  This isn't a word, but S-O-S by Rihanna.
[47:19.790 --> 47:20.890]  S-O-S.
[47:21.270 --> 47:21.930]  Fucking banger.
[47:23.170 --> 47:24.470]  Glamorous by Fergie.
[47:24.790 --> 47:25.230]  Banger.
[47:25.590 --> 47:25.890]  Yeah.
[47:26.390 --> 47:30.490]  It makes you wonder if other songs that don't do it would be just as popular today.
[47:30.490 --> 47:32.490]  Like, uh...
[47:34.210 --> 47:38.230]  Like, drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was D-R-Y.
[47:41.970 --> 47:45.490]  I feel like that would be an example of it removing...
[47:46.410 --> 47:47.910]  Yeah, that wouldn't be satisfying.
[47:48.970 --> 47:51.130]  Does YMCA count? Or do acronyms...
[47:51.130 --> 47:51.830]  Yeah, I don't...
[47:51.830 --> 47:52.070]  You have to spell it.
[47:52.190 --> 47:54.930]  I feel like that's still a spelling sequence.
[47:55.150 --> 47:55.730]  Yeah, that counts.
[47:55.730 --> 47:56.910]  It's not a word, but I think it counts.
[47:56.910 --> 47:57.310]  Totally counts.
[47:57.650 --> 47:58.550]  YMCA's a great one.
[47:59.270 --> 48:04.710]  I'm sure there are ones that exist that are bad, but like, every one I could think of, I was like, that's a great fucking song.
[48:05.330 --> 48:06.110]  It's a weird coincidence.
[48:07.090 --> 48:08.830]  Saturday Night by Bay City Rollers is a great one.
[48:09.030 --> 48:11.150]  S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y.
[48:12.470 --> 48:13.730]  Great. Fantastic song.
[48:14.150 --> 48:16.150]  What a fucking song that is.
[48:16.330 --> 48:20.550]  I want to start a new segment on F*** Face where we just listen to Andrew excitedly sing songs.
[48:21.130 --> 48:21.550]  Can we talk...
[48:22.990 --> 48:24.330]  Do you have any other ones?
[48:24.590 --> 48:25.810]  Is there any song you can think of?
[48:25.810 --> 48:30.910]  I was really enjoying Saturday Night by the Bay City Rollers.
[48:31.650 --> 48:34.010]  I can't think of any other spell songs.
[48:34.550 --> 48:39.730]  Although, I bet the regulation listeners and comment leavers can think of tons.
[48:40.430 --> 48:42.590]  I'm sure there's tons, yeah, that we're just not aware of.
[48:42.890 --> 48:44.350]  Literally, every one I could think of.
[48:44.390 --> 48:46.330]  I couldn't think of one where I was like, I don't really like that song.
[48:46.790 --> 48:47.350]  They're all great.
[48:47.910 --> 48:50.010]  I feel like I've heard D-O-double-G spelled a few times.
[48:50.410 --> 48:52.190]  Absolutely, and that's always great.
[48:52.890 --> 48:54.310]  That's never bad.
[48:54.490 --> 48:55.350]  That's always a banger.
[48:55.350 --> 49:00.630]  But speaking of segments that we do, we f***ed up last episode.
[49:01.490 --> 49:02.350]  We're idiots.
[49:03.210 --> 49:07.850]  We did not make any guesses as to who the previously on voice is.
[49:08.710 --> 49:12.550]  I know Eric has compiled a document for you guys.
[49:12.810 --> 49:14.510]  He's got the information he just posted in the chat.
[49:14.930 --> 49:17.530]  This cannot just endlessly go on.
[49:17.970 --> 49:22.410]  So I'm going to put a little bit of pressure on the two of you because you have information.
[49:22.630 --> 49:23.670]  You have research.
[49:23.730 --> 49:25.250]  You have the notes in front of you now.
[49:25.250 --> 49:27.150]  You should be able to solve this.
[49:27.630 --> 49:31.170]  If you are not able to get it, I'll give you three more episodes.
[49:31.450 --> 49:32.390]  Not including this one.
[49:32.630 --> 49:33.070]  Three more.
[49:33.650 --> 49:35.190]  You do not get it within those three.
[49:35.370 --> 49:36.630]  I'm just never going to tell you.
[49:37.010 --> 49:38.190]  Aw, you're a bastard.
[49:38.330 --> 49:39.290]  Why don't you give us another clue?
[49:40.010 --> 49:40.730]  Uh, okay.
[49:41.350 --> 49:41.830]  A clue.
[49:42.210 --> 49:43.630]  Should we quickly read out the guesses?
[49:43.930 --> 49:44.650]  Yeah, yeah.
[49:44.690 --> 49:46.210]  Why don't you go through the guesses?
[49:46.230 --> 49:47.230]  Guesses so far.
[49:48.430 --> 49:48.870]  Nick.
[49:50.070 --> 49:50.810]  Flukeface Geoff.
[49:50.910 --> 49:51.750]  Flukeface Andrew.
[49:51.750 --> 49:54.970]  The Naming Genius slash The Aconeer.
[49:55.230 --> 49:56.910]  The Lawyer from Higher Judge.
[49:57.570 --> 49:59.710]  Peter in brackets Waffle P.
[49:59.950 --> 50:00.450]  Jake.
[50:00.750 --> 50:02.730]  Garfield Kart Furious Racing Champion.
[50:03.290 --> 50:03.730]  Chris.
[50:04.190 --> 50:06.350]  Called at the end of episode 14 and did the outro.
[50:06.530 --> 50:06.870]  Caleb.
[50:06.950 --> 50:07.590]  Drew Saplin.
[50:07.990 --> 50:08.390]  Ian.
[50:08.690 --> 50:09.070]  Trevor.
[50:09.550 --> 50:10.950]  McDonald's Piss Lady.
[50:11.330 --> 50:12.430]  Don Zimmer's Son.
[50:12.770 --> 50:13.750]  Humpty Dumpty.
[50:14.070 --> 50:14.970]  Billy Ripkin.
[50:15.530 --> 50:16.990]  And a Naimo Firefighter.
[50:17.090 --> 50:18.310]  I don't remember half of those.
[50:18.790 --> 50:19.110]  I don't either.
[50:19.110 --> 50:19.810]  Yeah.
[50:20.070 --> 50:22.630]  I feel like you guys must have just like shotgun guesses.
[50:22.990 --> 50:25.570]  I guess we haven't done that many episodes worth of guesses.
[50:26.090 --> 50:30.930]  These are all confirmed guesses across the board including some guesses from listeners
[50:30.930 --> 50:32.530]  that Andrew has...
[50:32.530 --> 50:33.470]  Well, I guess they're commentators.
[50:33.490 --> 50:33.990]  Ah, okay.
[50:34.550 --> 50:37.790]  They've made guesses and Andrew has confirmed it's none of those people.
[50:38.150 --> 50:39.470]  This is even gives you more help.
[50:39.470 --> 50:39.850]  Yeah, yeah.
[50:39.910 --> 50:40.930]  We gave you some here.
[50:42.170 --> 50:43.770]  I'll give you a clue.
[50:45.350 --> 50:46.130]  So what is...
[50:46.130 --> 50:48.410]  I wish I had a list of what you've said so far.
[50:48.410 --> 50:49.930]  I feel like we've gone into...
[50:49.930 --> 50:52.170]  You've asked if they're a public figure and I said no.
[50:52.690 --> 50:54.230]  We have gone into that.
[50:54.770 --> 50:57.210]  I will say that I met them through this show.
[50:57.850 --> 51:00.390]  You met them through the show and it was in season two.
[51:01.130 --> 51:02.190]  Yes, I believe so.
[51:02.230 --> 51:03.930]  I should go back and confirm that.
[51:04.430 --> 51:05.490]  I believe it was season two.
[51:05.810 --> 51:07.190]  Met them through this show.
[51:07.570 --> 51:08.670]  Met them through this...
[51:08.670 --> 51:12.930]  If this show didn't exist, I would have never crossed paths with them.
[51:13.350 --> 51:17.950]  Oh, what about the guy that slacked us?
[51:18.710 --> 51:19.530]  Which guy?
[51:20.170 --> 51:21.000]  That was the guy who...
[51:21.730 --> 51:23.930]  Are you saying is it Greg from accounting?
[51:24.390 --> 51:24.630]  Yeah.
[51:25.530 --> 51:26.390]  Is that your guess?
[51:26.410 --> 51:30.230]  Greg from accounting is an incorrect guess.
[51:30.470 --> 51:32.970]  I wouldn't guess that because it doesn't work here anymore.
[51:33.370 --> 51:34.590]  He switched companies.
[51:35.010 --> 51:35.250]  Oh, really?
[51:35.570 --> 51:35.990]  Yeah.
[51:37.290 --> 51:40.010]  That's why you don't hear from Greg from accounting anymore for like the last year.
[51:40.250 --> 51:40.690]  But that...
[51:40.690 --> 51:41.170]  Okay.
[51:42.830 --> 51:44.290]  Greg not from accounting.
[51:45.630 --> 51:46.730]  Greg from other accounting.
[51:48.370 --> 51:48.870]  Uh...
[51:49.690 --> 51:50.190]  Well...
[51:50.810 --> 51:51.770]  What was that?
[51:52.410 --> 51:54.810]  I'm gonna say I'm going like Jeopardy rules.
[51:54.970 --> 51:56.730]  You need to be correct with the...
[51:57.270 --> 52:01.450]  I'm not implying that that is the correct answer and you just phrased it wrong.
[52:02.470 --> 52:04.530]  You need to be correct as opposed to incorrect?
[52:05.130 --> 52:06.490]  Yeah, it needs to be...
[52:06.490 --> 52:09.190]  You have to have the name of the thing correctly displayed.
[52:09.550 --> 52:10.850]  The name of the thing.
[52:11.230 --> 52:12.110]  Or the person.
[52:14.030 --> 52:15.990]  Why are you phrasing it like a weirdo?
[52:15.990 --> 52:22.950]  Okay, so like if you guessed the director from the Tuxedo, I would not accept that. But if you said Kevin Donovan, I would accept that.
[52:24.590 --> 52:24.990]  Oh...
[52:24.990 --> 52:26.250]  So you may be correct...
[52:26.250 --> 52:29.010]  Wait, why was that not on the guest list? Because we guessed him, didn't we?
[52:29.410 --> 52:29.910]  Yeah, we did.
[52:30.350 --> 52:31.290]  How, uh...
[52:31.290 --> 52:32.210]  That's a shitty list, Eric.
[52:32.650 --> 52:38.870]  Hold on. So is... is it... do we know... do Gavin and I both know this person's name?
[52:39.410 --> 52:40.370]  You're allowed to guess... yes.
[52:40.370 --> 52:43.330]  Or do we have to do... or do we have to do research to find out their name?
[52:43.910 --> 52:47.470]  Yeah, well, yeah. You both know... well, I don't know the answer to that.
[52:47.470 --> 52:49.890]  I think you're saying yeah to a lot of stuff here that's confusing the shit out of me.
[52:50.210 --> 52:52.770]  Yeah, well, I don't... I don't know the answer to that question.
[52:53.030 --> 52:53.510]  You should.
[52:53.790 --> 52:53.930]  Yeah, Geoff.
[52:54.790 --> 52:55.770]  I will say this.
[52:56.870 --> 52:58.490]  Fuck. Well, now I don't know what to do.
[52:58.950 --> 53:00.250]  Eric, can I have a ruling on this?
[53:00.670 --> 53:02.330]  I will consider...
[53:03.630 --> 53:06.010]  What... how... how do I... how do I...
[53:06.010 --> 53:08.490]  You... you... listen. You worked yourself into this corner, buddy.
[53:08.490 --> 53:15.110]  Well, no, I feel... no, I feel like we've talked about this. I feel like under Jeopardy rules, I don't think they've got it right. Would you agree with that?
[53:15.250 --> 53:17.930]  Don't... don't... I don't think we ever talked about Jeopardy rules ever.
[53:17.930 --> 53:23.370]  No, but we've talked about people have made guesses and it's like close but not exactly.
[53:23.870 --> 53:25.190]  What are we... what's the rule about this?
[53:25.190 --> 53:29.170]  Well, surely, if we've said the person and it's that person, we win?
[53:29.690 --> 53:32.390]  But it's not... you haven't technically said the person.
[53:32.390 --> 53:42.390]  This is where... this is where I can't... listen. I need to be not involved in this now because now it's becoming an Andrew thing and I don't have anything to do with it.
[53:42.410 --> 53:43.430]  No, no, no, no, no.
[53:43.590 --> 53:48.090]  You seem like we've not been close in any way. You said that we might have it.
[53:48.790 --> 53:54.210]  I... you are so close but not quite right. But you're... you're so...
[53:54.210 --> 53:55.030]  Oh my God.
[53:55.050 --> 54:01.150]  This is why I'm saying you have to separate me from this because now... because now this is an Andrew thing.
[54:01.150 --> 54:02.410]  I can't be a part of this.
[54:02.550 --> 54:06.870]  How is this an Andrew thing? We've talked about this. We've talked about this. You've agreed with this.
[54:07.010 --> 54:08.610]  I don't want... I don't want anything to do with this now.
[54:08.730 --> 54:09.650]  You've agreed with this offline.
[54:10.270 --> 54:18.830]  No, no, because now he starts talking... now he's... because now he's talking about Jeopardy rules and all this other stuff and I can't... I can't be a part of this anymore.
[54:19.070 --> 54:21.650]  Well, you've agreed already though. That's what I... okay, whatever.
[54:21.650 --> 54:22.750]  Let me ask you this.
[54:23.050 --> 54:23.410]  Okay.
[54:23.890 --> 54:26.130]  When... when we said someone...
[54:26.130 --> 54:26.310]  Yep.
[54:26.730 --> 54:27.610]  ...to you...
[54:27.610 --> 54:27.970]  Yep.
[54:28.350 --> 54:29.170]  ...was that the person?
[54:29.770 --> 54:32.170]  Uhh, in what context? Sorry.
[54:32.510 --> 54:34.630]  IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FUCKING CONTEXT!
[54:34.810 --> 54:36.390]  WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHAT CONTEXT?!
[54:36.390 --> 54:38.490]  DIDN'T WE GUESS THE FUCKING PERSON?!
[54:38.490 --> 54:40.510]  OH MY GOD, WHAT A STUPID THING TO SAY!
[54:40.770 --> 54:42.450]  Well, I don't know what you mean by that.
[54:42.550 --> 54:43.290]  YOU GUESSED...
[54:44.170 --> 54:44.650]  AHHHHHHH!
[54:47.310 --> 54:47.790]  WHAT?!
[54:47.790 --> 54:49.630]  Calm down. Calm down.
[54:49.950 --> 54:54.590]  You got... I'm gonna... I'm gonna rework what Gavin just asked me and explain it.
[54:55.170 --> 54:55.650]  AHHH!
[54:55.650 --> 55:00.170]  You've gotten the name right, you haven't got...
[55:00.170 --> 55:01.610]  I got the name right?
[55:01.950 --> 55:05.730]  You got the name right, but not their actual role.
[55:06.370 --> 55:10.630]  If they were a character, it would be like if you said
[55:10.630 --> 55:13.170]  Batguy, and you meant Batman.
[55:13.730 --> 55:15.950]  Oh, Greg from...
[55:15.950 --> 55:17.730]  Was he not an accountant?
[55:19.190 --> 55:21.570]  Yeah, there's a specific title.
[55:22.210 --> 55:23.290]  I'm searching Slack.
[55:23.290 --> 55:24.510]  Oh, Greg.
[55:25.430 --> 55:27.230]  There's a lot of Gregs that don't work anymore.
[55:29.910 --> 55:31.730]  Not that one, I know that one.
[55:32.630 --> 55:35.090]  Is it that one? No, that one never talked to me.
[55:35.330 --> 55:35.650]  Hold on.
[55:36.770 --> 55:38.930]  What about this one?
[55:39.550 --> 55:41.070]  No, he's never said a word to me.
[55:43.250 --> 55:43.650]  Greg.
[55:45.070 --> 55:45.850]  Oh, what about that one?
[55:46.370 --> 55:49.430]  You know what, this is pivoted. I feel betrayed by Eric in this moment.
[55:49.670 --> 55:50.890]  I feel like this is a great betrayal.
[55:50.890 --> 55:53.570]  Really, Andrew, at this point, you are so...
[55:53.570 --> 55:55.050]  This is a great betrayal by Eric.
[55:55.050 --> 55:58.310]  You want to talk about being in the deep end of water? You're treading, man.
[55:58.630 --> 56:02.690]  No, I am in a four foot hot tub and I can see the floor.
[56:02.850 --> 56:04.810]  It is clear, I am comfortable.
[56:05.550 --> 56:07.050]  I mean, I know the dudes...
[56:07.630 --> 56:08.970]  Greg from Finance and Strategy!
[56:09.270 --> 56:10.650]  He got it!
[56:11.070 --> 56:12.330]  Yeah, we got it. Greg in Finance.
[56:12.910 --> 56:17.450]  Oh God, you are a real pedantic stickler bastard.
[56:18.270 --> 56:21.950]  That was the guy you should have just said yes when I guessed Greg.
[56:22.070 --> 56:23.630]  No, you said Greg from Accounting.
[56:24.170 --> 56:26.930]  I didn't even say Greg. I said that guy who slacked us.
[56:27.030 --> 56:28.710]  You're the one who filled it in to Greg.
[56:29.250 --> 56:32.010]  Accounting and financing is the same fucking thing, dude.
[56:32.170 --> 56:33.490]  It's the same department in the company.
[56:34.250 --> 56:35.490]  It's a different nickname.
[56:36.310 --> 56:39.290]  See, this is why I couldn't be a part of it anymore.
[56:39.450 --> 56:40.410]  Because I knew you got it.
[56:40.750 --> 56:42.450]  Now it's too...
[56:43.030 --> 56:43.790]  No, no, no, no, no.
[56:43.790 --> 56:47.370]  No, it's not. Let me fucking go into our Slack chat.
[56:47.450 --> 56:48.790]  Because Eric and I have talked about it.
[56:48.790 --> 56:51.410]  I'm like, so many people have been so close, but not exact.
[56:51.530 --> 56:52.590]  And you're like, yeah, it's crazy.
[56:52.970 --> 56:53.990]  Everyone's so close.
[56:57.490 --> 57:00.650]  I would send the guesses to Greg that guessed him.
[57:00.770 --> 57:02.350]  And then he would downvote them.
[57:06.230 --> 57:08.090]  Jesus Christ. Well, how's Greg doing?
[57:08.630 --> 57:11.190]  I didn't know he didn't work at the company anymore.
[57:11.190 --> 57:13.970]  I thought they were having an issue with payroll or something.
[57:14.670 --> 57:15.310]  Go in.
[57:16.070 --> 57:17.950]  It's like, oh, you're in accounting? No, I'm in finance.
[57:18.150 --> 57:18.990]  And you're like, okay, bye.
[57:22.530 --> 57:24.530]  I agree. Sorry, I'm not Greg from payroll.
[57:24.750 --> 57:25.510]  I'm Greg from accounting.
[57:25.930 --> 57:27.810]  What do you guys do here in accounting?
[57:28.010 --> 57:28.790]  We handle payroll.
[57:29.630 --> 57:33.110]  Oh, jeez. This is why I couldn't get on board with this.
[57:33.290 --> 57:35.550]  As soon as you said Greg, I'm like, yeah, they got it.
[57:35.790 --> 57:36.850]  If I...
[57:37.430 --> 57:38.110]  Jeopardy rules.
[57:38.670 --> 57:41.390]  He wanted it to last three more episodes.
[57:41.510 --> 57:42.310]  Yeah, no kidding.
[57:42.810 --> 57:45.950]  Imagine trying to guess Greg again at that point.
[57:46.270 --> 57:48.650]  Would you have ever come back to that?
[57:48.850 --> 57:48.970]  Never.
[57:49.530 --> 57:52.150]  No. Time out.
[57:52.610 --> 57:53.150]  Time out.
[57:53.570 --> 57:56.370]  If I put a poster of fucking Superman on the wall,
[57:56.570 --> 57:57.990]  and I say who's that character,
[57:58.130 --> 57:59.430]  and you say Superguy,
[57:59.650 --> 58:00.970]  that's not correct.
[58:01.350 --> 58:02.670]  That is an incorrect guess.
[58:02.830 --> 58:05.350]  If I had to pick him out of a lineup,
[58:05.350 --> 58:07.130]  and you said Superguy,
[58:07.210 --> 58:08.930]  I'd probably think you were talking about Superman.
[58:09.170 --> 58:10.890]  If he was stood next to the blob.
[58:10.890 --> 58:12.130]  But you're making me do the leap.
[58:13.010 --> 58:14.730]  That's not a correct guess.
[58:15.390 --> 58:16.450]  That's a correct guess.
[58:16.970 --> 58:18.070]  Hey, Geoff. Yeah.
[58:18.610 --> 58:19.410]  Was this worth it?
[58:19.710 --> 58:22.930]  No. Greg in financing and Greg in accounting are the same person.
[58:23.330 --> 58:24.870]  We know that.
[58:25.350 --> 58:26.650]  We know who that...
[58:26.650 --> 58:29.370]  It's the only person who filled that role
[58:29.370 --> 58:31.130]  with the name Greg in this company.
[58:31.610 --> 58:33.350]  You are arguing...
[58:33.350 --> 58:34.630]  You are being pedantic right now,
[58:34.690 --> 58:36.170]  and you are arguing semantics.
[58:36.550 --> 58:39.310]  What a move to say no.
[58:40.610 --> 58:40.750]  Clearly, clearly,
[58:40.750 --> 58:41.990]  you guessed the right person.
[58:42.550 --> 58:45.490]  Andrew, I wish there was something...
[58:45.490 --> 58:47.290]  I wish we had a verb
[58:47.290 --> 58:49.580]  that was stronger than salad cream.
[58:50.350 --> 58:51.690]  Like, I wish there was
[58:51.690 --> 58:53.410]  something above salad cream
[58:53.410 --> 58:54.910]  for what you've just done.
[58:55.310 --> 58:57.290]  Not only to Gavin, not only to I,
[58:57.470 --> 58:59.350]  but to the entire community.
[58:59.890 --> 59:00.730]  First of all,
[59:00.730 --> 59:03.170]  you're the biggest technicality guy
[59:03.170 --> 59:04.870]  I know. You're always googling
[59:04.870 --> 59:07.110]  the fucking dictionary whenever anything comes up.
[59:07.290 --> 59:09.050]  I don't want to hear semantics by you,
[59:09.350 --> 59:10.870]  the dictionary fucking kid.
[59:11.250 --> 59:12.170]  I don't want to hear it.
[59:12.430 --> 59:14.850]  Second of all, there was a long pause.
[59:14.950 --> 59:16.010]  If you listen to the tape,
[59:16.250 --> 59:18.270]  I was in a real pickle in that moment.
[59:18.470 --> 59:19.390]  I didn't know what to say.
[59:20.210 --> 59:22.870]  And you went the wrong way.
[59:23.050 --> 59:24.770]  Well, I feel like after
[59:25.490 --> 59:26.450]  six episodes,
[59:26.930 --> 59:29.130]  if you guess super guy for super man,
[59:29.130 --> 59:31.010]  that's kind of, like, that's not great.
[59:31.210 --> 59:33.270]  So then I guided, because I didn't feel bad.
[59:33.270 --> 59:33.810]  We said his name.
[59:34.730 --> 59:37.430]  But you got it wrong. That's not his title.
[59:37.630 --> 59:38.730]  It's not his character name.
[59:38.870 --> 59:41.150]  He's Greg in finance. He's the character Greg
[59:41.150 --> 59:42.970]  in accounting. He's not the same as Greg in finance.
[59:43.150 --> 59:44.390]  I understand he's in the same profession.
[59:44.810 --> 59:47.430]  It's not the same in the context of what the name is.
[59:48.330 --> 59:49.710]  I, oh my god.
[59:50.310 --> 59:51.070]  You're right, though.
[59:51.110 --> 59:52.810]  You won. Congratulations!
[59:53.330 --> 59:53.890]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[59:55.650 --> 59:57.290]  Apparently, on this list,
[59:57.290 --> 59:58.770]  someone guessed Humpty Dumpty.
[59:58.870 --> 01:00:01.170]  That's like guessing Humpty Dumpty, but not
[01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:03.150]  specifying the egg from the wall.
[01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:05.370]  No! He's like, no, technically
[01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:06.930]  his name is Sir Humpty Dumpty.
[01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:09.470]  He was knighted, so you don't have the full title.
[01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:11.350]  I had to distance myself
[01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:13.450]  as soon as he said, if you were to guess
[01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:15.070]  the director of the tuxedo,
[01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:17.050]  but didn't guess him by name, I'm like,
[01:00:17.110 --> 01:00:18.790]  that's the craziest. No!
[01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:20.150]  That's, like, so nuts.
[01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:22.130]  Jeopardy rules!
[01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:25.570]  You gotta specify that at the beginning, you fool!
[01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:27.730]  Why do I have to specify that at the beginning?
[01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:29.790]  You don't! You don't create
[01:00:29.790 --> 01:00:31.390]  the rule set on week seven
[01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:32.890]  of the fucking contest, dude!
[01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:35.610]  No, to be fair to me, I didn't feel the rules were
[01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:37.450]  important when you kept making the same fucking
[01:00:37.450 --> 01:00:38.910]  guess three weeks in a row!
[01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:40.450]  The rules didn't seem vital!
[01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:43.230]  Was Caleb, if it was him, would we have had to have guessed
[01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:45.270]  Caleb, a little screen-looking bastard?
[01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:46.570]  Like, what are we supposed to do?
[01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:49.950]  No, no, Caleb is fine. Caleb is no...
[01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:51.570]  Reagan Finance is a
[01:00:51.570 --> 01:00:53.330]  specifically known character.
[01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:57.930]  Oh, man, the return of Greg and Finance.
[01:00:58.110 --> 01:00:59.630]  What an awesome way to end
[01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:01.190]  this episode. Thank you
[01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:03.650]  for sticking with us and listening to
[01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:05.790]  another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:07.570]  If you made it this far, you
[01:01:07.570 --> 01:01:09.350]  got hard, hard,
[01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:11.590]  hard fucked by Andrew. So did we!
[01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:13.630]  Go ahead and leave us a review
[01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:15.670]  if you don't mind. I hope you don't knock
[01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:16.990]  a star off because of that.
[01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:19.690]  I assume it was all in good fun.
[01:01:19.770 --> 01:01:21.350]  Or he's a fucking lunatic. I don't know.
[01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:22.550]  See you next time!
[01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:27.650]  Hey guys, regular fan Jack here
[01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:29.930]  with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:31.910]  The candy will kill them all.
[01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:33.630]  Gavin has issues with his hose.
[01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:35.010]  That's too much neck.
[01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:37.610]  Geoff has swan problems. Don't jump off
[01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:39.630]  bridges. There's a bonus bit on the logo.
[01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:41.750]  It's time for jet ski season.
[01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:43.430]  And once again, Andrew
[01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:45.550]  does not eat the pencil. All that and
[01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:47.590]  more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
