[00:15.470 --> 00:16.350]  Kind sir!
[00:16.810 --> 00:18.230]  Don't do that, dude.
[00:18.670 --> 00:20.010]  Did I say kind sir or good sir?
[00:20.430 --> 00:21.330]  What did I say earlier?
[00:21.450 --> 00:22.890]  It's creepy either way you say it.
[00:23.110 --> 00:24.130]  Kind sir!
[00:25.970 --> 00:30.210]  Let me introduce you to episode 105 of this podcast.
[00:30.490 --> 00:31.270]  I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:31.690 --> 00:32.430]  Why do I want to leave?
[00:33.310 --> 00:36.190]  Dude, he's been on... he's been in rare form.
[00:36.810 --> 00:37.950]  He tried to...
[00:37.950 --> 00:41.190]  He argued that no dance has ever been impressive for a while.
[00:41.970 --> 00:43.390]  And then we had to get...
[00:43.390 --> 00:44.710]  We had to look up the...
[00:44.710 --> 00:46.750]  We had to look up the definition of impressive.
[00:47.370 --> 00:49.190]  It was too much pleasantry.
[00:49.890 --> 00:51.330]  We've been around for a while.
[00:51.590 --> 00:52.970]  There are plenty of high-skilled...
[00:52.970 --> 00:55.570]  It was just discussing mainly, I guess, how I associate
[00:55.570 --> 00:57.090]  what impressed means to me.
[00:58.190 --> 00:59.790]  What did you just eat or drink
[00:59.790 --> 01:01.030]  like half an hour before this?
[01:01.110 --> 01:03.210]  I had a chicken wrap that Eric thought...
[01:03.210 --> 01:05.010]  I said rabbit, and then it just kind of
[01:05.010 --> 01:05.990]  spiraled from there.
[01:07.550 --> 01:09.170]  I have a bird infestation
[01:09.170 --> 01:11.290]  in my home right now, on my roof.
[01:11.930 --> 01:13.010]  I feel like I could catch a bird,
[01:13.090 --> 01:14.330]  but a rabbit I could never catch.
[01:14.490 --> 01:15.190]  With your hands?
[01:15.630 --> 01:19.030]  No, I said with like a McDonald's bag and a net.
[01:19.690 --> 01:20.910]  If you give me a day
[01:21.390 --> 01:22.910]  and a bag of McDonald's
[01:22.910 --> 01:24.690]  that had fries in it at one point,
[01:24.770 --> 01:26.390]  maybe even one fry just to make it
[01:26.390 --> 01:28.490]  super extra spicy on that trap,
[01:29.070 --> 01:30.110]  I could catch me a seagull.
[01:30.450 --> 01:32.350]  How do I hire you to do this tomorrow?
[01:32.690 --> 01:33.790]  Buy me a net, I guess,
[01:34.330 --> 01:35.410]  and a bag of McDonald's.
[01:35.410 --> 01:37.610]  Eric, can we Amazon him
[01:37.610 --> 01:38.790]  a butterfly net?
[01:39.230 --> 01:41.370]  Is it gonna fit in his mail slot?
[01:42.130 --> 01:42.990]  No, it'll be fine.
[01:43.190 --> 01:44.510]  Not with all the Bovril in there.
[01:45.510 --> 01:47.310]  I may have killed somebody
[01:47.310 --> 01:48.210]  by accident.
[01:48.750 --> 01:49.970]  Go ahead.
[01:50.490 --> 01:53.090]  I think it was the last one. I don't know.
[01:53.330 --> 01:54.370]  This doesn't make any sense to me.
[01:55.730 --> 01:56.870]  Before you do that,
[01:57.210 --> 01:58.930]  hello and welcome to another episode of the
[01:58.930 --> 02:00.970]  F*** Face Podcast. My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[02:01.170 --> 02:03.450]  With me, as always, Gavin Free
[02:03.450 --> 02:05.490]  and newly confessed
[02:05.490 --> 02:07.190]  murderer Andrew Panton. Go ahead.
[02:07.330 --> 02:08.890]  Before I get into my murder story,
[02:09.370 --> 02:11.690]  I'd like to pivot for a minute to something else
[02:11.690 --> 02:13.430]  and just own up, because I'm a big
[02:13.430 --> 02:15.410]  accountability guy. I want to own up to
[02:15.410 --> 02:17.330]  the fact that I was wrong.
[02:17.550 --> 02:18.590]  I was wrong last week.
[02:18.870 --> 02:21.630]  I handled the name
[02:21.630 --> 02:22.670]  thing incorrectly.
[02:23.210 --> 02:25.770]  I apologize. I apologize to you both.
[02:26.630 --> 02:27.590]  I wanted to give
[02:27.590 --> 02:29.330]  my perspective on it, because
[02:29.330 --> 02:31.670]  I thought about it, I put some time in,
[02:31.670 --> 02:33.830]  really think about the situation as a whole.
[02:33.930 --> 02:35.830]  You were so wrong. This apology
[02:35.830 --> 02:36.630]  is annoying me.
[02:37.130 --> 02:38.990]  I couldn't have been more in the wrong.
[02:39.290 --> 02:40.550]  Why are you annoyed by my apology?
[02:41.870 --> 02:43.170]  It's just bringing it up again.
[02:43.630 --> 02:43.810]  Oh!
[02:46.890 --> 02:47.730]  The Greg
[02:47.730 --> 02:48.590]  from Finance.
[02:49.330 --> 02:51.590]  I had no idea what you were talking about.
[02:51.670 --> 02:53.030]  I completely forgot about that.
[02:53.110 --> 02:54.550]  Were you just sitting silently?
[02:55.030 --> 02:57.430]  I was just trying to put it together
[02:57.430 --> 02:58.950]  and be like, what f***ing name thing?
[02:59.970 --> 03:00.770]  Nick said
[03:00.770 --> 03:02.910]  Jeopardy rules, and I was like, oh, did we do a Jeopardy?
[03:02.990 --> 03:04.210]  I was just out of it.
[03:04.670 --> 03:07.010]  Yeah, that's right. You were a bit of a dick about the
[03:07.010 --> 03:07.330]  name thing.
[03:07.630 --> 03:10.110]  I appreciate the apology.
[03:10.550 --> 03:12.190]  I was getting riled up.
[03:13.110 --> 03:13.690]  You're right.
[03:14.530 --> 03:16.930]  It was a ridiculous position
[03:16.930 --> 03:18.310]  to have and to hold.
[03:18.710 --> 03:20.690]  What happened was I was so
[03:20.690 --> 03:22.890]  excited about the thing, and I thought
[03:22.890 --> 03:24.050]  we're going to give clues.
[03:25.190 --> 03:27.030]  We're really going to turn up the heat
[03:27.030 --> 03:29.250]  in these next three episodes. Will you guys
[03:29.250 --> 03:31.270]  figure out the name? Will you not?
[03:31.750 --> 03:32.650]  We will find out.
[03:32.770 --> 03:35.290]  I give one clue, and Gavin immediately gets it.
[03:35.510 --> 03:36.230]  And I was on tilt.
[03:36.430 --> 03:38.390]  I was on tilt from that moment forward,
[03:38.710 --> 03:40.950]  and I didn't want it to end, but I also
[03:40.950 --> 03:42.970]  deep down knew that you guys would never
[03:42.970 --> 03:44.630]  fairly guess Greg again
[03:44.630 --> 03:45.910]  in a different context.
[03:46.270 --> 03:48.810]  It would have taken 700 more episodes
[03:48.810 --> 03:50.530]  before we realized how close we were.
[03:50.950 --> 03:52.650]  I also never, in my head,
[03:52.750 --> 03:55.110]  I had the Jeopardy rules. I never established those.
[03:55.110 --> 03:57.110]  It's unfair of me. If I would have, from the beginning,
[03:57.530 --> 03:59.010]  stated that, I think that would be
[03:59.010 --> 04:00.190]  fair, but that was unfair of me.
[04:00.570 --> 04:03.050]  I put some thought into it,
[04:03.090 --> 04:05.070]  and I've been haunted by that
[04:05.070 --> 04:06.770]  moment since we recorded.
[04:07.130 --> 04:08.630]  Not because of that itself.
[04:08.910 --> 04:10.710]  I processed and realized,
[04:10.810 --> 04:12.510]  I was wrong. I handled that poorly.
[04:12.910 --> 04:14.750]  What has haunted me is
[04:14.750 --> 04:16.930]  Geoff was coming at me, and I was
[04:16.930 --> 04:19.290]  getting mad at Geoff, and we're going back and forth,
[04:20.190 --> 04:21.070]  and I
[04:21.070 --> 04:23.330]  called you the dictionary kid,
[04:23.330 --> 04:25.270]  which is the dumbest thing I may have said
[04:25.270 --> 04:27.390]  on the show, and as soon as
[04:27.390 --> 04:29.410]  I said it, I winced, and I have
[04:29.410 --> 04:31.510]  not been able to stop thinking about the fact
[04:31.510 --> 04:32.770]  I said dictionary,
[04:33.210 --> 04:35.390]  and I couldn't think of... I was thinking
[04:35.390 --> 04:37.430]  piss boy, I was like, where should I go
[04:37.430 --> 04:39.470]  with this? I need another word off of dictionary,
[04:39.710 --> 04:41.250]  and kid came out, and
[04:41.250 --> 04:43.410]  that's an apology to the audience, that I
[04:43.410 --> 04:44.270]  said dictionary kid.
[04:44.410 --> 04:46.410]  I've been suffering.
[04:47.450 --> 04:49.570]  I've been suffering. Well, maybe you did,
[04:49.830 --> 04:51.050]  but I just...
[04:51.050 --> 04:53.550]  It was such a lame...
[04:53.550 --> 04:54.830]  Laughing at, not laughing at.
[04:54.870 --> 04:57.070]  Yeah, it was a bad moment.
[04:57.230 --> 04:58.650]  I'm typically good under fire.
[04:59.150 --> 05:00.730]  Enjoy the next seven days,
[05:01.230 --> 05:03.290]  because that's how long you have until that episode
[05:03.290 --> 05:04.570]  comes out. Oh, great.
[05:04.730 --> 05:07.070]  That's fine. I'm sure people will be mad, but that's
[05:07.070 --> 05:08.770]  okay. When you said... That's funny to me.
[05:08.790 --> 05:10.810]  I fucked that up. When you said dictionary
[05:10.810 --> 05:12.870]  kid, it reminded me, when you said it,
[05:13.150 --> 05:15.030]  it sounded like the name
[05:15.030 --> 05:17.290]  of a late 60s, early 70s
[05:17.290 --> 05:18.990]  Disney made for TV movie.
[05:18.990 --> 05:20.890]  And I wanted to bring that up,
[05:20.890 --> 05:23.170]  but I didn't get a
[05:23.170 --> 05:23.670]  chance.
[05:25.250 --> 05:27.050]  I genuinely winced as soon
[05:27.050 --> 05:28.990]  as I said it, and I had thoughts about asking
[05:28.990 --> 05:30.870]  Nick to remove it from the edit, but I was like,
[05:30.910 --> 05:33.030]  that's so bad, I just gotta live. I gotta live
[05:33.030 --> 05:35.250]  with that. I was thinking, piss boy,
[05:35.390 --> 05:36.910]  what's something that is like, boy,
[05:37.070 --> 05:38.850]  this kid came out, it was an unfortunate
[05:38.850 --> 05:41.070]  moment, but I'm happy to get
[05:41.070 --> 05:43.050]  past it. And I guess I should now talk about how I
[05:43.050 --> 05:45.010]  may have killed somebody, which is the
[05:45.010 --> 05:46.330]  point of how this started. Yeah.
[05:46.330 --> 05:48.130]  Well, before you do that, let me just say,
[05:48.390 --> 05:50.150]  that was an extremely
[05:51.070 --> 05:51.950]  regulation apology,
[05:52.590 --> 05:54.350]  and I would like to provide
[05:55.610 --> 05:56.490]  I would like
[05:56.490 --> 05:58.570]  to accept it in the most regulation of ways.
[05:58.910 --> 05:59.790]  I appreciate that.
[06:00.710 --> 06:02.370]  Now, you killed.
[06:02.510 --> 06:04.130]  So I was saying, yeah, with the candies,
[06:04.270 --> 06:06.070]  I brought up recently that I've discovered
[06:06.690 --> 06:08.450]  Skittles gummies. Specifically
[06:08.450 --> 06:09.550]  the Walbury gummies.
[06:09.990 --> 06:12.130]  Big fan of them. I love them.
[06:12.590 --> 06:14.370]  I recommended them to a friend,
[06:14.370 --> 06:16.250]  he bought a box of 12, he didn't
[06:16.250 --> 06:18.270]  like them as much as me, so he just ended up with 10
[06:18.270 --> 06:20.370]  that he didn't like. But I love them,
[06:20.430 --> 06:22.430]  I order them to my house. It's the very
[06:22.430 --> 06:23.790]  first time since I've been here,
[06:24.190 --> 06:26.030]  I got robbed. Somebody
[06:26.030 --> 06:28.630]  stole my Skittles gummies.
[06:29.010 --> 06:30.510]  They got left outside
[06:30.510 --> 06:32.190]  of my front door, by Amazon.
[06:32.830 --> 06:34.290]  And they ripped through all
[06:34.290 --> 06:36.330]  of my boxes, and I was both upset
[06:36.330 --> 06:38.370]  that they stole the Skittle gummies that I was
[06:38.370 --> 06:40.430]  so excited about, and then also
[06:40.430 --> 06:42.550]  offended at what they left behind.
[06:42.550 --> 06:44.450]  Like, I felt judged
[06:44.450 --> 06:46.610]  by the person who robbed me. They didn't take the
[06:46.610 --> 06:48.550]  Sour Patch Kids. They didn't take the iced
[06:48.550 --> 06:50.190]  tea I bought. I was hurt.
[06:51.070 --> 06:52.810]  It made me feel like I had bad taste.
[06:53.350 --> 06:54.870]  Like the person clearly...
[06:54.870 --> 06:55.930]  I got robbed.
[06:56.490 --> 06:57.790]  You got robbed by potheads.
[07:00.730 --> 07:02.090]  They didn't get far,
[07:02.270 --> 07:04.530]  they're around somewhere. I guarantee you.
[07:04.730 --> 07:06.010]  Do you think they would have left the Bovril?
[07:06.510 --> 07:08.190]  I think they would have
[07:08.650 --> 07:10.490]  left everything. If the first thing they
[07:10.490 --> 07:12.330]  encountered was the Bovril, they just would have left.
[07:12.490 --> 07:14.350]  They would determine that the boxes
[07:14.350 --> 07:16.510]  not worth stealing from. If that was the first
[07:16.510 --> 07:17.970]  item that they bought. The ultimate deterrent.
[07:18.210 --> 07:19.750]  Get all these glitter bobs out of here.
[07:21.350 --> 07:22.550]  I would be
[07:22.550 --> 07:24.470]  so mad if I stole a box
[07:24.470 --> 07:26.010]  and it shot Bovril at me.
[07:26.330 --> 07:27.910]  You can't. You're stuck.
[07:28.330 --> 07:29.190]  You're just marked.
[07:30.010 --> 07:32.210]  It's terrible. So I stole it.
[07:32.210 --> 07:34.330]  I was really upset about it, and then it came out
[07:34.330 --> 07:36.310]  like two days ago that
[07:36.310 --> 07:38.270]  Mars had a massive
[07:38.270 --> 07:40.110]  recall because their
[07:40.110 --> 07:42.150]  Skittles gummies contained pieces
[07:42.150 --> 07:43.970]  of metal in them. Oh!
[07:44.530 --> 07:46.330]  And the person that I recommended try
[07:46.330 --> 07:48.210]  the gummies, all of their gummy
[07:48.210 --> 07:50.250]  packs were in that order. They had to
[07:50.250 --> 07:52.090]  throw away their ten bags of gummies
[07:52.090 --> 07:54.110]  because they all could possibly contain. What kind of metal?
[07:54.710 --> 07:55.650]  I'm not sure.
[07:56.230 --> 07:58.450]  But there was a recall on them because they contained
[07:58.450 --> 08:00.290]  small pieces of metal, apparently.
[08:00.750 --> 08:02.270]  And so now, I don't know
[08:02.270 --> 08:04.130]  what happened to the person. Mine could have been
[08:04.130 --> 08:06.210]  filled with metal, and someone else
[08:06.210 --> 08:08.190]  stole them and ate them. I hope they're okay.
[08:08.590 --> 08:10.270]  They could have saved me. Maybe they're
[08:10.270 --> 08:11.630]  my hero? I don't know. That's some strength.
[08:12.350 --> 08:14.530]  Dude, that pothead saved your life.
[08:14.790 --> 08:16.290]  Potentially. Or I killed a pothead
[08:16.290 --> 08:18.190]  unknowingly. It's the same thing.
[08:19.070 --> 08:20.150]  One of the two. I guess, yeah.
[08:20.310 --> 08:22.350]  I didn't mean to. But two sides of the same
[08:22.350 --> 08:24.130]  coin. The important thing is we're talking
[08:24.130 --> 08:26.250]  to you, not them. You know what's worse?
[08:26.350 --> 08:28.230]  Maybe, like, this is the greatest insight about me.
[08:28.730 --> 08:30.130]  I've felt way more dread
[08:30.130 --> 08:32.030]  about the fact that I said dictionary kid
[08:32.030 --> 08:34.490]  than I potentially killed this guy that stole the Skittles.
[08:34.490 --> 08:35.170]  The gal.
[08:35.950 --> 08:38.950]  One was an accident, the other one came out of your mouth on purpose.
[08:39.370 --> 08:40.630]  I hope cringe ranks higher
[08:40.630 --> 08:42.730]  than murder on your conscience.
[08:44.910 --> 08:45.950]  Not in all cases.
[08:46.370 --> 08:47.030]  In this one, it did.
[08:47.710 --> 08:49.830]  So this has been sort of my last few days.
[08:50.130 --> 08:51.470]  How have things been for you guys?
[08:51.950 --> 08:54.350]  Oh, good, man. Gav, how have you been?
[08:54.850 --> 08:55.850]  Yeah, pretty good.
[08:56.050 --> 08:58.410]  I was just filling a big
[08:58.410 --> 08:58.830]  balloon.
[08:59.870 --> 09:02.210]  And you would think that the balloon would be
[09:02.210 --> 09:04.290]  what exploded. The hose
[09:04.290 --> 09:06.090]  exploded. What? Are you serious?
[09:06.530 --> 09:06.910]  Yeah.
[09:08.270 --> 09:09.590]  Did it make you hurt?
[09:10.230 --> 09:11.730]  No, it just exploded.
[09:12.130 --> 09:14.370]  Now, when you say exploded, was it
[09:14.370 --> 09:16.370]  excitingly exploded or it just
[09:16.370 --> 09:18.230]  like ruptured and it started
[09:18.230 --> 09:20.070]  leaking out the side? Like, what type of
[09:20.070 --> 09:21.490]  explosion are we talking?
[09:22.830 --> 09:23.670]  Oh, he has video.
[09:24.110 --> 09:25.590]  Oh, fuck, here we go. All right.
[09:26.030 --> 09:27.810]  I was like, I didn't think that was a tough question.
[09:28.030 --> 09:29.570]  The silence. Whoa!
[09:29.570 --> 09:30.710]  Let's see.
[09:32.030 --> 09:33.570]  Okay, that's cool.
[09:35.330 --> 09:36.970]  Yeah, that's certainly an explosion.
[09:38.250 --> 09:39.750]  That was pretty recent. That was about
[09:39.750 --> 09:41.310]  18 minutes ago.
[09:41.730 --> 09:43.450]  How old is that hose?
[09:43.770 --> 09:45.090]  It was bought yesterday.
[09:45.470 --> 09:47.370]  Wow, so it's clearly had a
[09:47.370 --> 09:49.550]  manufacturer's defect. Yeah, I think
[09:49.550 --> 09:51.190]  there may have been some metal strands
[09:51.190 --> 09:51.950]  in that hose.
[09:54.810 --> 09:55.570]  Because it
[09:55.570 --> 09:57.450]  went pop. How many hoses
[09:57.450 --> 09:59.270]  do you have? Were you fucked?
[09:59.610 --> 10:01.430]  Did you have a replacement? Uh, no, that
[10:01.430 --> 10:03.650]  was the replacement for a shittier hose.
[10:03.770 --> 10:05.330]  But we then relegated back to the
[10:05.330 --> 10:07.190]  shit hose. But it was fine. We got by.
[10:07.710 --> 10:09.090]  You know you can Amazon Prime
[10:09.090 --> 10:11.090]  now something over pretty easily.
[10:11.670 --> 10:13.310]  Uh, yeah. A bit of
[10:13.310 --> 10:15.250]  tight window. It was the last thing I was
[10:15.250 --> 10:17.350]  expecting. I was like looking at
[10:17.350 --> 10:18.910]  the balloon and I heard a pop and
[10:18.910 --> 10:21.250]  suddenly the balloon was still there. Very confusing.
[10:21.710 --> 10:23.090]  I think in all the time
[10:23.090 --> 10:25.330]  I've spent in hardware stores and stores
[10:25.330 --> 10:27.510]  in general, I don't think I've ever heard anyone frantically
[10:27.510 --> 10:28.490]  buy a hose.
[10:28.990 --> 10:31.330]  It's a rare item that people would ever need
[10:31.330 --> 10:33.330]  in an immediate...
[10:34.010 --> 10:35.270]  Like I couldn't imagine like the fire
[10:35.270 --> 10:37.350]  department running in like, yeah, any hose!
[10:37.590 --> 10:38.830]  Do you have any hose?
[10:41.010 --> 10:41.770]  All of ours
[10:41.770 --> 10:43.350]  exploded. That feels like such a
[10:43.350 --> 10:44.570]  Michael Bay movie moment.
[10:45.770 --> 10:46.970]  Firefighters using their hose and they
[10:46.970 --> 10:49.130]  explode and they have to go to like Home Hardware
[10:49.130 --> 10:51.210]  or Home Depot or whatever and buy more hoses.
[10:52.190 --> 10:53.450]  Yeah, the reason you use
[10:53.450 --> 10:55.190]  a hose is typically for a very slow
[10:55.730 --> 10:57.370]  problem. Like my plant
[10:57.370 --> 10:59.130]  is dying very slowly over time.
[10:59.470 --> 11:01.370]  I can't imagine suddenly needing
[11:01.370 --> 11:03.430]  one. Unless you're going to drive away from
[11:03.430 --> 11:05.370]  a fire. I want to see somebody fight
[11:05.370 --> 11:07.410]  a fire with a crazy daisy. This crazy
[11:07.410 --> 11:09.290]  daisy in their head, flopping around.
[11:13.990 --> 11:15.410]  What Eric wrote, that's
[11:15.410 --> 11:17.290]  how I imagined a snake would
[11:17.290 --> 11:19.510]  Yeah, I felt the exact
[11:19.510 --> 11:21.330]  same. It looked very snake-like.
[11:21.330 --> 11:23.430]  What do you mean? Why would you imagine that?
[11:23.870 --> 11:25.450]  I don't know. It makes
[11:25.450 --> 11:27.330]  sense, right? It looks like a snake.
[11:27.790 --> 11:29.510]  Yeah. Like when a snake
[11:29.510 --> 11:31.350]  eats a hippo and it's too big and it just
[11:31.350 --> 11:32.530]  bursts out the side? Yeah.
[11:32.690 --> 11:35.130]  It gets too far, because it's not the beginning
[11:35.130 --> 11:36.810]  of the snake that explodes.
[11:37.230 --> 11:39.190]  It gets too far into the snake
[11:39.190 --> 11:41.310]  and that part of the snake is too thin
[11:41.310 --> 11:43.270]  and then the snake just pops and then
[11:43.270 --> 11:45.110]  rolls around for a while. It's probably
[11:45.110 --> 11:47.450]  got a weakened tummy from eating all those
[11:47.450 --> 11:48.590]  Skittles gummies.
[11:50.110 --> 11:50.470]  Yeah.
[11:50.870 --> 11:52.610]  I was trying to think if, like, from
[11:52.610 --> 11:54.650]  Anaconda, because I do agree, Gavin,
[11:54.730 --> 11:56.710]  it's sort of a weird thought, but I feel
[11:56.710 --> 11:58.510]  like I've seen a snake explode
[11:58.510 --> 12:00.670]  in that way in a movie, so I was trying to
[12:00.670 --> 12:02.710]  think of, like, one movie, but I don't think it happens
[12:02.710 --> 12:04.690]  in Anaconda. Well, I tell you what, it can't
[12:04.690 --> 12:06.590]  happen enough. And I couldn't think of any other
[12:06.590 --> 12:08.730]  snake movies. Doesn't Jon Voight come back out
[12:08.730 --> 12:11.070]  of the Anaconda? Uh...
[12:11.070 --> 12:12.710]  He gets, like, weirdly eaten. I think
[12:12.710 --> 12:14.630]  they just kill the Anaconda with an
[12:14.630 --> 12:16.450]  axe. I feel like it's kind of lame
[12:16.450 --> 12:18.370]  how they... by my memory.
[12:18.590 --> 12:20.050]  But I haven't seen that movie in a long time.
[12:20.590 --> 12:22.570]  I remember the first time I saw Anaconda
[12:22.570 --> 12:24.650]  was at a sleepover at a friend's
[12:24.650 --> 12:26.230]  house. It was, like, a birthday party sleepover.
[12:26.530 --> 12:28.610]  And Owen Wilson was in it, and I knew
[12:28.610 --> 12:30.390]  who Owen Wilson was from, like, Zoolander and
[12:30.390 --> 12:32.430]  Shanghai Noon. And I assumed he was just
[12:32.430 --> 12:33.950]  always, like, an A-list actor.
[12:34.370 --> 12:36.370]  And I confidently declared that
[12:36.370 --> 12:38.590]  he would survive. I'm like, oh, he's gonna live
[12:38.590 --> 12:40.390]  to the end. And he's, I think, the
[12:40.390 --> 12:42.570]  second guy to die in that movie.
[12:42.690 --> 12:44.710]  And I stopped watching, and
[12:45.350 --> 12:46.670]  there was, like, clearly something
[12:46.670 --> 12:48.570]  was happening in the movie, and I said,
[12:48.610 --> 12:50.790]  oh, what's going on? And then somebody just yelled back to me,
[12:50.930 --> 12:52.670]  that guy you said wouldn't die is getting
[12:52.670 --> 12:54.710]  killed. I felt so dumb.
[12:55.250 --> 12:56.290]  He's had some pretty good deaths.
[12:56.610 --> 12:58.670]  Was it the... what was that movie? The Haunting?
[12:58.990 --> 13:00.690]  Where, like, the fireplace knocks his head off?
[13:01.090 --> 13:02.850]  He gets decapitated. He went through a real
[13:02.850 --> 13:04.530]  run of deaths, too, like Armageddon,
[13:04.610 --> 13:06.650]  as well. I feel like all those movies kind of came out
[13:06.650 --> 13:08.710]  back to back to back. I feel like you have to
[13:08.710 --> 13:10.890]  put in the deaths until you become so beloved
[13:10.890 --> 13:12.710]  that you don't die in movies anymore. Unless
[13:12.710 --> 13:14.890]  you're Sean Bean. Yeah, I was about to say,
[13:15.070 --> 13:16.670]  nobody's told Sean Bean. Unless
[13:16.670 --> 13:18.770]  you're just so good at it, it becomes a hallmark of
[13:19.330 --> 13:20.990]  performance. Maybe Anaconda
[13:20.990 --> 13:22.750]  could be one of our next watches.
[13:23.370 --> 13:24.850]  And we still need to do MVP 2.
[13:25.050 --> 13:26.810]  I've been waiting forever. Let's do that soon.
[13:27.410 --> 13:28.750]  Doesn't it seem like snakes
[13:28.750 --> 13:30.690]  should have an Achilles heel? They don't
[13:30.690 --> 13:32.910]  really. Well, you never need to have a heel.
[13:33.350 --> 13:34.730]  Well, yeah, but, like, you know, vampires
[13:34.730 --> 13:36.870]  have garlic, or crosses,
[13:37.330 --> 13:38.670]  and, like, werewolves have silver
[13:38.670 --> 13:40.710]  bullets, or, uh...
[13:42.270 --> 13:42.810]  Slugs have
[13:42.810 --> 13:44.690]  salt, right? Like, there should be
[13:44.690 --> 13:46.830]  a thing. You could just stamp on their
[13:46.830 --> 13:48.590]  head. Yeah, but, like,
[13:48.690 --> 13:50.790]  you should be able to, like, throw milk at a snake
[13:50.790 --> 13:52.330]  and it shrivels up. No, I
[13:52.750 --> 13:54.730]  agree with Geoff. I don't feel like I know what
[13:54.730 --> 13:55.810]  to do in a snake attack.
[13:56.390 --> 13:58.450]  Have a hippo and you shove it down its throat.
[13:59.770 --> 14:00.610]  I feel like,
[14:00.810 --> 14:02.950]  don't you hit, you hit sharks in the nose,
[14:03.030 --> 14:04.390]  right? Like, that's the shark thing.
[14:04.550 --> 14:05.910]  I feel like that's their Achilles.
[14:06.330 --> 14:08.650]  I didn't even know the gills. I think you should also turn
[14:08.650 --> 14:10.650]  the shark upside down. I feel like
[14:10.650 --> 14:12.610]  unless you're, like, James Brown, and
[14:12.610 --> 14:14.650]  you can split your way, well, like, getting
[14:14.650 --> 14:16.750]  halfway, then do the split, like, I don't know what
[14:16.750 --> 14:18.890]  the move would be. Yeah. Is it an eye poke?
[14:19.350 --> 14:20.930]  What is it? There has to be
[14:20.930 --> 14:22.910]  something. What is it? What's...
[14:22.910 --> 14:24.670]  Yeah. Like, you stick your finger in its
[14:24.670 --> 14:26.770]  snake butthole, and it paralyzes
[14:26.770 --> 14:28.650]  it, maybe? If you're in a snake
[14:28.650 --> 14:30.690]  area, make sure you always have an umbrella with you.
[14:31.170 --> 14:31.650]  Just be ready.
[14:32.490 --> 14:34.170]  Turn it upside down and rub its belly,
[14:34.550 --> 14:36.050]  like a crocodile when you go to sleep.
[14:36.050 --> 14:38.150]  Do six barrel rolls.
[14:38.330 --> 14:39.750]  On the inside. They all
[14:39.750 --> 14:41.770]  tie it in a knot.
[14:45.790 --> 14:46.750]  So harsh.
[14:49.190 --> 14:50.410]  It's like, come after me
[14:50.410 --> 14:51.090]  now, motherfucker.
[14:51.950 --> 14:53.490]  I'm just imagining...
[14:55.610 --> 14:56.370]  I'm imagining
[14:56.370 --> 14:58.230]  being half-eaten by a snake, and then
[14:58.230 --> 15:00.250]  just rolling down a large hill
[15:00.250 --> 15:02.170]  while it's trying to eat you, and you both just
[15:02.170 --> 15:03.690]  fall down a mountainside.
[15:07.450 --> 15:08.310]  God damn.
[15:08.730 --> 15:09.810]  Hey, we...
[15:09.810 --> 15:11.830]  Should we talk about...
[15:11.830 --> 15:14.150]  That was a decapitation event
[15:14.150 --> 15:16.030]  this weekend. I can't believe we haven't brought it up yet.
[15:16.430 --> 15:17.850]  What? Owen Wilson?
[15:18.030 --> 15:20.230]  What do you mean? We all hung out...
[15:20.230 --> 15:21.510]  Oh man, Henry's going at it.
[15:21.990 --> 15:23.570]  He really is. Yeah, he is.
[15:24.130 --> 15:25.450]  He woke up.
[15:26.290 --> 15:28.010]  And he found the...
[15:28.010 --> 15:28.730]  I don't know what I hid.
[15:30.070 --> 15:31.630]  We hung out this weekend,
[15:31.750 --> 15:33.230]  and we went swimming together.
[15:33.890 --> 15:34.950]  Two weekends in a row
[15:34.950 --> 15:36.490]  with Eric, not a water guy.
[15:37.490 --> 15:38.650]  Went swimming again.
[15:39.230 --> 15:40.810]  Eric is so a water guy, by the way.
[15:40.810 --> 15:43.350]  He's so a water guy. He invited everybody to water.
[15:43.770 --> 15:44.610]  Yeah, but I was...
[15:44.610 --> 15:47.070]  Okay, here's the thing. I was talking to my small wife about this.
[15:47.210 --> 15:48.990]  I was saying that
[15:48.990 --> 15:51.210]  I was on the boat most of the time,
[15:51.310 --> 15:53.090]  sometimes in the water, sometimes on the big
[15:53.090 --> 15:55.090]  lily pad. Geoff was in the
[15:55.090 --> 15:57.330]  water almost 100%
[15:57.330 --> 15:59.270]  of the time we were allowed to be in the water.
[15:59.590 --> 16:00.530]  Oh my god, yes.
[16:00.530 --> 16:02.410]  It was crazy. I felt like
[16:02.410 --> 16:04.450]  I saw you sometimes,
[16:04.850 --> 16:06.510]  and it's only because I had to go to
[16:06.510 --> 16:08.670]  where you were, which was in the water.
[16:09.450 --> 16:10.530]  I didn't realize
[16:10.530 --> 16:12.330]  that that was the case. There was a moment where
[16:12.330 --> 16:14.590]  you were on the lily pad, but then there were
[16:14.590 --> 16:16.770]  like 12 dudes around
[16:16.770 --> 16:18.530]  it. It was like talking to you like you were
[16:18.530 --> 16:19.290]  on a big plate.
[16:20.850 --> 16:22.410]  It was. That was really funny.
[16:23.150 --> 16:24.370]  You were the belle of the ball.
[16:24.670 --> 16:26.650]  It really was like having a weird harem.
[16:26.950 --> 16:28.750]  I don't think I liked it much,
[16:28.750 --> 16:29.750]  but it was good enough.
[16:30.910 --> 16:32.730]  But we did. We hung out on Lake
[16:32.730 --> 16:34.630]  Travis. Eric's small wife
[16:34.630 --> 16:36.750]  rented a party boat,
[16:36.930 --> 16:38.990]  like a two-decker party boat for Eric's
[16:38.990 --> 16:40.730]  I guess your birthday, because we got you
[16:40.730 --> 16:42.750]  birthday presents. And then
[16:42.750 --> 16:44.470]  we just spent like half a day swimming,
[16:44.810 --> 16:46.570]  and there was a lily pad, and we brought
[16:46.570 --> 16:48.930]  floaties, and we went diving,
[16:49.350 --> 16:50.650]  and we played games,
[16:50.710 --> 16:52.630]  and we threw balls, and we had all kinds of fun.
[16:52.650 --> 16:54.870]  That's awesome. But the guy,
[16:55.230 --> 16:56.790]  the captain, and I say captain lightly
[16:56.790 --> 16:57.650]  because he was like 19,
[16:58.790 --> 17:00.830]  the captain, as he was driving us out there,
[17:01.010 --> 17:02.790]  he was like, y'all want to go to Devil's
[17:02.790 --> 17:04.730]  Cove? That's where everybody usually goes, or
[17:04.730 --> 17:06.810]  we could go over here, a little
[17:06.810 --> 17:08.770]  closer. And we were like, we don't give a fuck.
[17:08.830 --> 17:10.610]  Let's go closer. And is it empty?
[17:10.630 --> 17:12.710]  And he's like, yeah, there's nobody here. So we went
[17:12.710 --> 17:14.590]  there because it was empty. And
[17:14.590 --> 17:16.770]  then like, we were there for like maybe two hours
[17:16.770 --> 17:18.710]  swimming and having fun, and then he gets
[17:18.710 --> 17:20.750]  a radio call on the boat, and then he goes,
[17:21.210 --> 17:22.570]  you guys never believe this, but
[17:22.570 --> 17:24.830]  over there at Devil's Cove, somebody just got their
[17:24.830 --> 17:26.990]  arm ripped off. They had to medevac
[17:26.990 --> 17:28.730]  him out. Christ. Yeah.
[17:29.070 --> 17:30.790]  What? And I feel like we never
[17:30.790 --> 17:32.830]  found out anything else. We didn't find out why
[17:32.830 --> 17:35.010]  that hand came off. Emily spent the rest of the weekend
[17:35.010 --> 17:36.850]  looking to figure it out and couldn't find anything
[17:36.850 --> 17:38.570]  online about it anywhere. That
[17:38.570 --> 17:40.890]  information has to be delivered
[17:40.890 --> 17:42.730]  with more information. Has to
[17:42.730 --> 17:44.970]  contain more info. Otherwise
[17:44.970 --> 17:46.070]  why are you telling people?
[17:46.570 --> 17:48.790]  Well, I have a theory on this. Do you think
[17:48.790 --> 17:50.890]  that actually happened? Or do you think that's that
[17:50.890 --> 17:52.850]  guy's move? Spice up
[17:52.850 --> 17:55.030]  the trip a little bit. Inject yourself into the party.
[17:55.590 --> 17:56.830]  I do think it happened
[17:56.830 --> 17:58.910]  because I think we did see a medevac
[17:58.910 --> 18:00.970]  helicopter going from the area.
[18:01.370 --> 18:02.230]  Got it. However,
[18:02.810 --> 18:04.810]  I will agree that it needs to be
[18:04.810 --> 18:06.650]  given with more information because
[18:06.650 --> 18:08.990]  then when we were talking about it a little bit later,
[18:09.330 --> 18:10.870]  the captain with his
[18:10.870 --> 18:12.710]  hat over his eyes and his feet
[18:12.710 --> 18:14.850]  kicked up, I was going, hey Blaine, did you
[18:14.850 --> 18:16.730]  hear about that guy's arm who got chopped off?
[18:16.790 --> 18:18.650]  We don't know what happened to it. And I looked at the captain,
[18:18.750 --> 18:20.870]  he tilted his hat back and just sort of
[18:20.870 --> 18:22.810]  shrugged at me and then put it back
[18:22.810 --> 18:24.670]  down and just went back to sleep.
[18:26.590 --> 18:29.050]  How far away is the place
[18:29.050 --> 18:30.730]  that you could have went where it happened
[18:30.730 --> 18:33.050]  to where you were then? 10 minutes.
[18:33.550 --> 18:34.570]  10 minutes? Yeah. Maybe.
[18:34.610 --> 18:36.970]  That's fucking crazy. That'd be
[18:36.970 --> 18:39.030]  like if you said the neighbors were killed
[18:39.030 --> 18:40.930]  by Freddy Krueger or like Jason or
[18:40.930 --> 18:42.950]  something. Like I'd be so paranoid that whatever
[18:42.950 --> 18:44.810]  ripped that guy's arm off. It's okay though, it was
[18:44.810 --> 18:46.930]  three blocks away. Yeah, it's what?
[18:47.910 --> 18:48.630]  You mean
[18:48.630 --> 18:50.330]  the thing that just ripped
[18:50.330 --> 18:52.370]  somebody's arm off? It happened
[18:52.370 --> 18:54.190]  across the main road. You're okay.
[18:54.590 --> 18:56.410]  Yeah, like what are you talking about?
[18:56.950 --> 18:58.450]  Yeah, I would love to know. Like we were talking
[18:58.450 --> 18:59.590]  about with Meg and she
[19:00.930 --> 19:02.670]  I guess spent a lot of time on lakes
[19:02.670 --> 19:04.910]  when she was younger and she was saying that happens all the time.
[19:05.710 --> 19:08.390]  that doesn't make me feel any better. Like
[19:08.390 --> 19:10.010]  propeller will pop a hand off pretty quick.
[19:10.170 --> 19:12.430]  I guess also people get like
[19:12.430 --> 19:14.450]  their arms caught in ropes and then they get pulled
[19:14.450 --> 19:15.750]  and it just like...
[19:15.750 --> 19:17.550]  Oh Jesus Christ.
[19:17.650 --> 19:20.030]  If a rope loops around your arm
[19:20.030 --> 19:21.770]  and then suddenly goes very taut, it can
[19:21.770 --> 19:23.290]  ping a limb off I guess.
[19:23.830 --> 19:24.210]  Oh wow.
[19:25.490 --> 19:27.930]  It's one of those things you hear about. It's like wow, I wonder what they were doing.
[19:28.050 --> 19:29.470]  I wonder what crazy thing they were doing.
[19:29.870 --> 19:31.950]  I'm sure he was just like a guy with two arms
[19:31.950 --> 19:33.790]  just going on a party boat just like us.
[19:34.130 --> 19:35.690]  I'm sure he was just hanging out on the beach
[19:35.690 --> 19:37.210]  and a gust of wind came by.
[19:38.130 --> 19:39.170]  Blew his hand off.
[19:39.530 --> 19:41.450]  Blew his hand off. That's crazy.
[19:41.590 --> 19:43.710]  That was fucking wild. But it was a
[19:43.710 --> 19:45.750]  great time for everybody
[19:45.750 --> 19:46.950]  but that guy that day.
[19:47.530 --> 19:49.790]  Oh and probably the people he was with.
[19:50.010 --> 19:51.350]  So I hope he's okay wherever he is.
[19:51.430 --> 19:52.930]  I hope they were able to reattach it.
[19:55.070 --> 19:56.130]  That's always the hope.
[19:58.330 --> 19:59.790]  If you'll indulge me
[19:59.790 --> 20:01.530]  I do have another small
[20:01.530 --> 20:03.430]  story related to a personal tragedy.
[20:03.770 --> 20:05.550]  Please. I'd love to hear it.
[20:05.790 --> 20:07.770]  That's a weird way to respond
[20:07.770 --> 20:09.270]  to that tragedy statement.
[20:09.470 --> 20:10.930]  So this is...
[20:10.930 --> 20:12.730]  I would love to entertain you with it.
[20:13.770 --> 20:14.710]  So on Friday
[20:15.310 --> 20:16.710]  I had a thing fall through
[20:16.710 --> 20:18.510]  and I had a free window on Friday afternoon
[20:18.510 --> 20:21.110]  and Emily was off and she looked at me and she was like
[20:21.110 --> 20:22.790]  It seems like a great day to go
[20:22.790 --> 20:23.410]  jet skiing.
[20:24.610 --> 20:25.650]  And I was like
[20:26.430 --> 20:28.850]  Oh fuck. It would be a great day to go jet skiing.
[20:29.210 --> 20:30.530]  And we haven't been jet skiing
[20:30.530 --> 20:32.830]  this year. So it's probably been
[20:33.330 --> 20:34.490]  September of last year
[20:34.490 --> 20:37.110]  was the last time I went. And I don't know if you guys remember this
[20:37.110 --> 20:38.730]  but there was a point in time where
[20:38.730 --> 20:40.370]  we were a jet ski podcast
[20:40.370 --> 20:42.230]  and we sold jet ski merchandise
[20:42.230 --> 20:44.970]  because of how into jet skis one of us was.
[20:46.070 --> 20:46.510]  Well
[20:47.750 --> 20:48.910]  I was very
[20:48.910 --> 20:50.550]  excited. I was like holy shit
[20:50.550 --> 20:52.730]  I don't know why it didn't dawn on me that I can still
[20:52.730 --> 20:53.990]  jet ski. It was just like
[20:53.990 --> 20:56.250]  so we raced to the jet ski place
[20:57.850 --> 20:59.390]  and by the way
[20:59.390 --> 21:00.050]  jet skiing
[21:00.610 --> 21:02.790]  did not get lamer, did not get
[21:02.790 --> 21:04.850]  any less fun. If anything it's more
[21:04.850 --> 21:06.710]  fun than I remembered. Oh my
[21:06.710 --> 21:08.790]  fucking god, am I a jet ski guy
[21:08.790 --> 21:10.770]  again. I cannot
[21:10.770 --> 21:12.570]  tell you how much fucking
[21:12.570 --> 21:14.690]  fun a jet ski is.
[21:14.990 --> 21:16.950]  It is, well I mean Gavin you know you were on it once
[21:16.950 --> 21:18.850]  imagine how much fun you had. I had
[21:18.850 --> 21:20.590]  that much fun Friday, but more
[21:20.590 --> 21:23.010]  because jet skis just keep getting better and again.
[21:23.610 --> 21:24.930]  And so anyway we hop on
[21:25.390 --> 21:26.810]  Lake Austin, not Lake Travis
[21:26.810 --> 21:28.650]  where the guy got his arm lopped off, but Lake Austin
[21:28.650 --> 21:30.970]  which is much smaller. And it takes about
[21:30.970 --> 21:32.730]  takes about two hours to
[21:32.730 --> 21:34.810]  go from one end of Lake Austin, like from
[21:34.810 --> 21:36.970]  one dam to the other dam and back.
[21:37.050 --> 21:38.650]  So you can basically do like a full loop
[21:39.670 --> 21:40.710]  especially if you go about
[21:40.710 --> 21:42.910]  50-52. More of a
[21:42.910 --> 21:44.330]  river than a lake in my opinion.
[21:44.830 --> 21:46.790]  Yeah for a good period of it. And
[21:46.790 --> 21:48.870]  it's a lot of fun. And so
[21:48.870 --> 21:50.630]  the way we typically do it is like
[21:50.630 --> 21:52.910]  I'll ride the first hour, well we'll take one
[21:52.910 --> 21:54.910]  I'll drive the first hour, she'll
[21:54.910 --> 21:56.710]  sit on the back, we'll flip and then she'll do the
[21:56.710 --> 21:58.810]  way back or whatever. I should also
[22:00.210 --> 22:00.890]  just so I
[22:00.890 --> 22:02.950]  can be fair, I should
[22:02.950 --> 22:05.050]  mention this too. My girlfriend
[22:05.050 --> 22:06.870]  has informed
[22:06.870 --> 22:08.710]  me that she likes
[22:08.710 --> 22:10.570]  swans a normal amount.
[22:10.710 --> 22:13.010]  A regular amount. She likes
[22:13.010 --> 22:14.850]  swans no more or less than
[22:14.850 --> 22:16.370]  any of you guys like swans.
[22:16.570 --> 22:18.710]  She doesn't have a thing for swans.
[22:19.050 --> 22:20.990]  She's not way into swans. I told this
[22:20.990 --> 22:22.450]  story this weekend. I was practicing.
[22:22.930 --> 22:24.590]  I told it to some other friends of ours and
[22:24.590 --> 22:26.790]  apparently I lean too heavy
[22:26.790 --> 22:28.090]  on Emily's
[22:29.030 --> 22:30.410]  sudden love of swans.
[22:30.410 --> 22:32.750]  For the record
[22:32.750 --> 22:34.430]  she likes swans like
[22:34.430 --> 22:36.130]  a C, I guess.
[22:36.330 --> 22:38.030]  Whatever the average amount is.
[22:38.310 --> 22:39.070]  Despite the fact
[22:41.410 --> 22:42.530]  that we just went to
[22:42.530 --> 22:44.450]  London and we were there for a week and there were three
[22:44.450 --> 22:46.410]  things she got excited about. She got excited
[22:46.410 --> 22:48.650]  about Phantom of the Opera, she got excited
[22:48.650 --> 22:50.610]  about Hot Pot, and she got excited
[22:50.610 --> 22:51.910]  about swans.
[22:52.710 --> 22:54.270]  Only one of those things
[22:54.270 --> 22:56.570]  is now her lock screen
[22:56.570 --> 22:57.090]  on her iPhone.
[22:58.150 --> 22:59.150]  I'm not going to tell you which
[22:59.150 --> 23:00.870]  one it is but it's not Phantom of the Opera
[23:00.870 --> 23:03.110]  and it's not a plate of Hot Pot or a bowl of
[23:03.110 --> 23:05.310]  Hot Pot. But she just
[23:05.310 --> 23:07.010]  likes swans an average
[23:07.010 --> 23:08.770]  amount. However
[23:08.770 --> 23:11.030]  when she was driving and I was
[23:11.030 --> 23:12.870]  on the back about maybe an hour and a half into this
[23:12.870 --> 23:14.950]  she sees a swan and
[23:14.950 --> 23:16.610]  did the jet ski equivalent
[23:16.610 --> 23:19.010]  at 40 miles an hour of slamming on
[23:19.010 --> 23:20.630]  the brakes. And a jet ski doesn't go
[23:22.070 --> 23:22.470]  eeeeeeee!!!
[23:22.470 --> 23:24.950]  But if it did, it would have done it for a long time.
[23:25.730 --> 23:28.690]  Sees the swan, slams on the brakes, goes,
[23:28.870 --> 23:34.110]  Holy shit, look at that swan that I just have a regular amount of affection for.
[23:34.210 --> 23:36.170]  And I'm like, yeah, totally. It's a beautiful swan.
[23:36.670 --> 23:41.090]  And at this point, we're like, I'm going to say 75, 75 feet away from the swan.
[23:41.170 --> 23:42.470]  I think that's safe. It's a pretty good distance.
[23:42.470 --> 23:45.130]  But like, you know, I can see the swan. It's a big swan.
[23:46.170 --> 23:48.370]  And and she's like, wow, that thing is really pretty.
[23:48.530 --> 23:49.530]  And I'm like, yeah, it is pretty.
[23:49.570 --> 23:52.490]  And I'm enjoying the majesty of the swan, as is she,
[23:52.630 --> 23:54.830]  because I also like swans an average amount.
[23:54.830 --> 23:58.390]  I don't have it on my lock screen or anything, but I do enjoy swans.
[23:58.610 --> 23:59.730]  And so we're looking at it
[23:59.730 --> 24:02.310]  and it's just kind of like swanning around to the left a little bit.
[24:02.390 --> 24:04.330]  And then it swans over to the right a little bit.
[24:04.350 --> 24:06.010]  And it like dips its little swan beak.
[24:06.050 --> 24:07.470]  Not little at all. It's giant.
[24:07.550 --> 24:08.470]  It's swan beak in the water.
[24:08.550 --> 24:12.350]  And like, like kind of comes up like, I don't know, like what's her face
[24:12.350 --> 24:14.070]  in Fast Times at Ridgemont High when she comes out of the water.
[24:15.270 --> 24:18.250]  Phoebe Cates. And it's like there's droplets going everywhere.
[24:18.370 --> 24:19.450]  And it's just like this beautiful swan.
[24:19.490 --> 24:21.510]  And she's really taking in the majesty of the swan.
[24:21.510 --> 24:26.310]  And then it kind of turns around and it sees it registers that we exist.
[24:27.130 --> 24:30.830]  And, you know, we're in front of the swan and to the left about 75 feet.
[24:31.050 --> 24:33.730]  I'm fully turned around because I'm on the back of this thing.
[24:33.850 --> 24:36.330]  Emily's like, you know, between me and the front of the thing.
[24:36.390 --> 24:37.850]  And so she's kind of got to look over her shoulder.
[24:37.950 --> 24:41.230]  So she's like trying to steal glances of the swan and enjoy its majesty.
[24:41.550 --> 24:45.650]  And when it kind of turns around, it like it lifts up a little bit
[24:45.650 --> 24:50.130]  and it like opens up its swan arms and it like all these feathers come out.
[24:50.130 --> 24:52.590]  And Emily's like, oh, my God, that's beautiful.
[24:52.710 --> 24:53.650]  It's showing us its feathers.
[24:55.110 --> 24:56.690]  Which I agree, it was beautiful.
[24:58.430 --> 25:00.590]  But something about it seemed aggressive to me.
[25:01.470 --> 25:04.470]  And and and I got I don't know, something felt off.
[25:04.770 --> 25:07.110]  And then so she's kind of like still looking over and, you know,
[25:07.130 --> 25:07.990]  and the thing is drifting.
[25:08.150 --> 25:09.050]  So she's like looking around.
[25:09.090 --> 25:10.210]  We're also in the middle of Lake Austin.
[25:10.310 --> 25:11.090]  There's boats everywhere.
[25:11.090 --> 25:13.890]  So as a responsible jet ski driver
[25:13.890 --> 25:16.750]  who just slammed on the jet ski brakes in the middle of the water,
[25:16.790 --> 25:17.490]  she's like looking around,
[25:17.550 --> 25:19.490]  making sure nobody's going to clip us or we're going to hit anybody.
[25:19.490 --> 25:20.850]  You know, we're not in anybody's way.
[25:21.710 --> 25:23.450]  And the the swan.
[25:24.290 --> 25:26.070]  It made eye contact with me.
[25:26.850 --> 25:30.070]  And and, you know, that scene in the episode of Always Sunny
[25:30.070 --> 25:34.250]  where Mac and Charlie are both at the Italian restaurant Giordino's
[25:34.250 --> 25:37.970]  other ends and they make eye contact and they can't stop looking at each other.
[25:38.290 --> 25:39.430]  Keeps zooming in.
[25:39.630 --> 25:40.710]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25:40.710 --> 25:44.730]  Like the swan and I had that moment and it was unsettling for me. Right.
[25:45.290 --> 25:46.750]  And I was kind of transfixed.
[25:46.750 --> 25:48.070]  Almost all of it.
[25:48.170 --> 25:52.290]  You know how like Dracula in the maybe not new Dracula, but like the old Dracula,
[25:52.290 --> 25:55.070]  he would like look at a woman and she would become like transfixed.
[25:55.150 --> 25:55.730]  And that's how he would.
[25:55.870 --> 25:57.590]  And then he would like, you know, lay her down in his bed
[25:57.590 --> 25:58.330]  and then he would bite her neck.
[25:58.530 --> 26:01.850]  I felt a little bit like the the swan was transfixing me.
[26:01.910 --> 26:03.710]  Like it was just it was just weird. Right.
[26:04.170 --> 26:06.850]  And then this isn't going to sound real.
[26:08.790 --> 26:09.850]  But it is.
[26:10.070 --> 26:11.990]  I've been waiting for this and want to attack you.
[26:12.410 --> 26:14.630]  The swan cracked its neck.
[26:14.630 --> 26:17.230]  Like, you know, I like when you're about to get into a fight with somebody
[26:17.230 --> 26:19.430]  and you'll like crack your neck to the right and then to the left.
[26:20.090 --> 26:21.190]  Like roll your shoulders.
[26:23.150 --> 26:23.550]  Intimidating.
[26:23.850 --> 26:24.750]  The swan did that.
[26:25.170 --> 26:28.950]  What? And then all I can say, it was a lot of neck.
[26:29.050 --> 26:30.170]  All I could say is it was like.
[26:31.110 --> 26:33.570]  I realized that the swan was angry. Right.
[26:33.850 --> 26:38.370]  And I've kind of lost my voice because I'm still transfixed by Dracula swan.
[26:38.430 --> 26:42.470]  Right. And and I go, Emily, go, go.
[26:42.610 --> 26:43.450]  I think we should go.
[26:43.450 --> 26:45.310]  I think I think we should go.
[26:45.370 --> 26:46.290]  And she's like, huh?
[26:46.690 --> 26:50.050]  You know, and looking around and and then,
[26:50.510 --> 26:53.370]  you know, that scene in Terminator two where
[26:54.490 --> 26:56.810]  where Robert Patrick pulls them over, he's a cop
[26:56.810 --> 26:59.570]  and they realize he's a Terminator and they're driving away.
[26:59.710 --> 27:01.810]  And he starts running after them with his blade arms.
[27:01.950 --> 27:04.550]  And it's incredibly scary because he's going really fast.
[27:05.050 --> 27:06.490]  Yeah, it's like quite still.
[27:06.590 --> 27:08.550]  Yeah. And it's yeah, the head still.
[27:08.610 --> 27:10.950]  And it's super like focused and intent.
[27:12.130 --> 27:13.950]  Uh, the swan raised up.
[27:14.790 --> 27:17.370]  And then it charged at me like Robert Patrick
[27:18.190 --> 27:21.270]  with it's like half flying, half running on the water
[27:21.270 --> 27:24.230]  with its swan arms in front of it, just like the Terminator.
[27:25.090 --> 27:28.550]  And I scream, oh, my God, go.
[27:28.870 --> 27:30.230]  We've got to go.
[27:30.590 --> 27:32.530]  You I didn't say go, go now or at all at any point.
[27:32.570 --> 27:34.350]  I wasn't that I wasn't that clever.
[27:34.430 --> 27:36.890]  I was just like, Jesus Christ, we've got to go.
[27:37.090 --> 27:38.030]  And she goes, what?
[27:38.110 --> 27:40.050]  And then she kind of turns around and sees it.
[27:40.050 --> 27:41.690]  I look at her to be like, what the fuck?
[27:41.950 --> 27:43.190]  And then I see her eyes register.
[27:43.350 --> 27:44.270]  I turn back around.
[27:44.550 --> 27:49.430]  It has covered the span of 75 feet in less than two seconds.
[27:49.570 --> 27:52.550]  When I turn around, she starts to go.
[27:52.910 --> 27:56.370]  When I turn around to my right, I just see a swan arm coming at me.
[27:56.670 --> 28:02.570]  So I turn back to my left in time to see the swan cobra strike me in the back,
[28:02.890 --> 28:05.570]  right above my butt and to the left of my spine.
[28:05.790 --> 28:08.950]  All I could see is feathers and a giant swan face
[28:09.370 --> 28:13.590]  attack me and I get hit and like impact and it pushes me forward.
[28:13.950 --> 28:17.150]  And then it guns it and we go probably two hundred feet.
[28:17.250 --> 28:19.850]  And then she stops and she's like, are you OK?
[28:20.130 --> 28:22.430]  And I'm like, I think so.
[28:22.630 --> 28:23.390]  The swan bit me.
[28:23.610 --> 28:26.530]  The swan struck me and I'm looking and she's like, are you serious?
[28:26.650 --> 28:28.490]  And we're like checking to make sure all of our limbs are over there.
[28:28.590 --> 28:31.210]  And we turn around and the swan's still coming at us.
[28:31.670 --> 28:35.070]  It's still looking at us and it's like still coming, like the turn.
[28:35.390 --> 28:37.650]  So we gun it and we go even further.
[28:37.650 --> 28:40.230]  And and we just eventually just go.
[28:40.370 --> 28:41.750]  It's like we go under the 360 bridge.
[28:41.850 --> 28:46.350]  We're like miles away from the swan and I'm just fucking shook.
[28:46.490 --> 28:49.370]  Right. And we turn the thing and the guy's like, how was it?
[28:49.410 --> 28:52.310]  And Emily goes, we got attacked by a swan.
[28:52.370 --> 28:54.190]  And he goes, oh, swan got you, huh?
[28:54.510 --> 28:56.190]  Yeah, that's a mean son of a bitch.
[28:56.290 --> 28:58.550]  And I go, you know about the swan?
[28:58.590 --> 29:01.110]  And he goes, everybody knows about the swan.
[29:02.890 --> 29:05.130]  So I guess everybody knew about the swan, but us.
[29:05.130 --> 29:09.630]  I had a bruise where it hit me in the slot on my back.
[29:09.690 --> 29:11.190]  I think it's probably gone by now.
[29:11.950 --> 29:15.970]  And all I could think about for the rest of the day was if that if that's one
[29:15.970 --> 29:17.930]  had knocked me off the jet ski, I'm dead.
[29:18.770 --> 29:21.630]  There's no way it would still be on top of you.
[29:21.950 --> 29:26.170]  There's no way I could fight a swan in its fucking home turf.
[29:26.410 --> 29:29.590]  I'd be floating around on my life vest and just be popping me in the head.
[29:29.650 --> 29:31.190]  And I couldn't turn around fast enough.
[29:31.430 --> 29:33.050]  I would fuck a swan up on land.
[29:33.070 --> 29:34.930]  But I was so far away from land.
[29:34.930 --> 29:35.950]  I would never have made it.
[29:36.030 --> 29:37.070]  It would have picked my eyes out.
[29:37.250 --> 29:39.170]  I was like seconds away from dying.
[29:39.430 --> 29:42.470]  I was just imagining that scene in Home Alone 2
[29:42.470 --> 29:46.170]  where Marv gets caked in all the bird seed, all the pigeons come in.
[29:47.350 --> 29:49.870]  Like that's what it would have been like if you fell off.
[29:54.060 --> 29:54.940]  So anyway,
[29:56.520 --> 29:57.640]  not quite as...
[29:57.640 --> 29:58.540]  Dude, a swan bit your back.
[29:58.940 --> 29:59.940]  Swan bit me, dude.
[30:00.120 --> 30:04.220]  Not quite as dramatic as the whale shark story,
[30:04.400 --> 30:06.760]  but just it was terrifying.
[30:07.600 --> 30:10.120]  From Phoebe Cates to Robert Patrick.
[30:10.840 --> 30:12.140]  Oh, my God.
[30:13.260 --> 30:13.800]  Easily.
[30:14.340 --> 30:17.560]  Are you offended that it's still her lock screen?
[30:17.960 --> 30:21.160]  Like whatever you see that swan is, it doesn't bring back memories.
[30:21.880 --> 30:23.980]  No. Your nemesis is now a swan.
[30:24.400 --> 30:26.000]  No, no, no. I'm OK with it.
[30:26.160 --> 30:30.920]  I've been assured that Emily likes swans a regular amount and totally appropriate.
[30:31.160 --> 30:33.220]  So I'm not going to question that anymore.
[30:35.020 --> 30:39.300]  Oh, oh, it's pitching Robert Patrick now with honks.
[30:45.680 --> 30:51.430]  I swear to God that swan went 100 miles an hour in point one second.
[30:51.870 --> 30:56.390]  It was like it closed that gap of 75 feet in less than three seconds.
[30:56.390 --> 30:57.550]  More like two seconds.
[30:57.550 --> 31:00.170]  Like the time for me to like look back, back.
[31:00.290 --> 31:02.810]  It was on me. It was like it teleported.
[31:02.810 --> 31:05.710]  Did you think at any point you were going to have to kill a swan?
[31:06.070 --> 31:08.790]  I was. No, I'll be honest with you.
[31:08.850 --> 31:09.910]  I don't know that I could have.
[31:09.990 --> 31:11.150]  Like it was huge.
[31:11.230 --> 31:13.010]  It had to weigh 300 pounds, right?
[31:13.050 --> 31:13.950]  It was fucking massive.
[31:15.170 --> 31:18.630]  And I'm at a severe disadvantage in the water.
[31:19.110 --> 31:22.510]  Yeah, like I just don't I don't even know, dude.
[31:22.810 --> 31:23.790]  That's where swans are from.
[31:24.330 --> 31:25.490]  Yeah, that's where swans are from.
[31:26.850 --> 31:31.250]  How comparable was it to when Larry David got attacked by a swan and curb?
[31:31.810 --> 31:32.790]  It's the only thing I'm sure.
[31:33.010 --> 31:34.170]  Yeah, there's one of the black swan.
[31:34.350 --> 31:35.350]  Yeah, the black swan.
[31:35.430 --> 31:37.270]  There's an episode where they killed the guy.
[31:37.630 --> 31:39.430]  Oh, of course, one.
[31:39.570 --> 31:40.870]  And they murdered the swan.
[31:40.950 --> 31:44.270]  I was wondering as a visual comparison, because I feel like it's kind of
[31:44.270 --> 31:46.350]  what you're describing is like that, but on land.
[31:46.610 --> 31:49.190]  It's immediately what I thought of when you're talking about swans
[31:49.190 --> 31:51.870]  and the possibility of you getting into a swan fight.
[31:52.430 --> 31:53.110]  It's incredible.
[31:53.210 --> 31:56.930]  I remember hearing in England that the queen owns all the swans.
[31:57.270 --> 31:59.670]  I'm not sure if that's a load of shite or not,
[31:59.670 --> 32:02.770]  but I'm pretty sure you can't kill them if they go for you.
[32:02.990 --> 32:04.870]  But I think here, I don't think the queen's reach.
[32:05.550 --> 32:08.550]  I don't think she has jurisdiction over the American swan.
[32:08.670 --> 32:10.630]  So I think I think you're good to murder away.
[32:11.350 --> 32:15.130]  OK, so Eric asked if I'm sure the swan weighed 300 pounds.
[32:15.210 --> 32:16.350]  So I looked up how much a swan weighs.
[32:16.590 --> 32:18.230]  It had to weigh at least 30 pounds.
[32:19.850 --> 32:22.330]  Swans are like 30 pounds max.
[32:23.910 --> 32:24.630]  Like 300.
[32:25.510 --> 32:27.430]  What was a...
[32:27.430 --> 32:29.270]  When there's a swan on you in the water, dude,
[32:29.270 --> 32:30.330]  you're not a water guy.
[32:30.470 --> 32:31.290]  You're a water adjacent guy.
[32:31.330 --> 32:32.550]  It would be way worse for you.
[32:32.750 --> 32:35.850]  Who has a swan that's like 10 times denser than us?
[32:36.230 --> 32:39.910]  A swan seemed like a grizzly bear when it was on my back, biting me.
[32:40.750 --> 32:45.070]  I really want you to try to get like a spit sample from the swan
[32:45.070 --> 32:48.230]  to submit to 23andMe to determine where it came from.
[32:48.610 --> 32:51.450]  See if you legally are allowed to go fight that swan.
[32:51.610 --> 32:53.670]  If it's under the queen's protection or not.
[32:54.270 --> 32:55.350]  Yeah, I wonder if they migrate.
[32:56.150 --> 32:58.150]  Does their jurisdiction wear off?
[32:59.150 --> 33:01.630]  Oh, well, so anyway,
[33:01.830 --> 33:05.310]  drove from there straight to the jet ski store to buy a jet ski.
[33:06.210 --> 33:06.670]  You bought one?
[33:07.030 --> 33:07.370]  No.
[33:07.650 --> 33:09.910]  Guess what the jet ski store didn't have?
[33:10.250 --> 33:11.350]  A single jet ski.
[33:11.570 --> 33:13.550]  They had a picture of a jet ski.
[33:13.910 --> 33:15.230]  I left very dejected.
[33:15.270 --> 33:17.150]  You get a fridge before you get a jet ski.
[33:17.450 --> 33:18.050]  So yeah, dude.
[33:18.430 --> 33:19.610]  A fridge and my fucking bike.
[33:20.070 --> 33:23.230]  That's how much fun jet skiing is in your mind, that you went out,
[33:23.310 --> 33:27.210]  you got attacked by a large bird and your instinct was to buy the thing
[33:27.210 --> 33:28.630]  that would let you do that more.
[33:29.030 --> 33:29.990]  That was your response.
[33:30.250 --> 33:31.250]  100 percent.
[33:31.590 --> 33:33.370]  Fantastic. Yes, I love it.
[33:33.530 --> 33:36.730]  That that's why I will steer clear of the swan.
[33:36.830 --> 33:37.910]  Oh, going forward.
[33:38.170 --> 33:40.590]  I will definitely stay the fuck away from swans.
[33:41.030 --> 33:44.910]  I mean, I'll be honest, I would have stayed away from the swan had I been driving.
[33:45.510 --> 33:47.090]  It wasn't my decision.
[33:48.350 --> 33:51.290]  But yeah, I think we'll cut a wide swath around the swans.
[33:51.610 --> 33:54.270]  The rest of it on unbelievable fun.
[33:54.650 --> 33:56.630]  Oh, my God. I want a jet ski.
[33:57.210 --> 34:01.130]  It's so great that this one has a rep like fucking Quint from Jaws
[34:01.130 --> 34:04.350]  is going to be on a dock talking about the swan that's in the water.
[34:04.730 --> 34:06.450]  You can't catch it up.
[34:06.770 --> 34:09.830]  Apparently it's a known evil, which means it's always around.
[34:10.150 --> 34:12.330]  So anybody wants to go see the swan?
[34:12.390 --> 34:13.370]  I'll take you all sometime.
[34:13.510 --> 34:14.510]  Let's just rent a jet ski.
[34:14.610 --> 34:16.070]  And I know exactly where it is.
[34:16.510 --> 34:18.410]  Coming this summer, honks.
[34:21.990 --> 34:23.930]  Wait, the swans, that's geese, isn't it?
[34:23.950 --> 34:25.490]  The swans honk? I don't think they do.
[34:25.490 --> 34:26.850]  I think they all.
[34:27.130 --> 34:29.730]  I'm sure it has its own terrible sound.
[34:29.990 --> 34:31.290]  Nick says they both honk.
[34:31.590 --> 34:34.890]  I'm just like the scene from so we're referencing a lot of movies today,
[34:34.970 --> 34:36.390]  but the scene from Psycho with that
[34:37.730 --> 34:39.170]  like just honk noises.
[34:43.670 --> 34:48.570]  Somebody should just cut swans and honking into all horror movie.
[34:49.010 --> 34:51.170]  Oh, that'd be great.
[34:51.710 --> 34:55.330]  I don't feel like we've gotten a swan horror movie that I'm aware of.
[34:55.330 --> 34:56.370]  We've gone snakes.
[34:57.090 --> 34:59.710]  We've gone birds, not swans.
[34:59.830 --> 35:01.590]  Was a swan in the birds?
[35:01.710 --> 35:03.030]  I haven't seen the birds in a while.
[35:03.090 --> 35:04.070]  I don't think there was.
[35:04.390 --> 35:05.370]  I saw that groundhog.
[35:05.990 --> 35:06.470]  Yeah.
[35:14.480 --> 35:16.680]  This podcast is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[35:17.040 --> 35:20.440]  Life can be overwhelming and many people are burnt out without even knowing it.
[35:20.820 --> 35:23.760]  Symptoms can include lack of motivation, feeling helpless or trapped,
[35:23.940 --> 35:25.600]  detachment, fatigue and more.
[35:26.520 --> 35:29.400]  I experience a lot of those things with burnout, as I've talked about
[35:29.400 --> 35:31.780]  before, it's draining in so many ways.
[35:31.920 --> 35:33.880]  It just is a terrible thing to be going through.
[35:34.280 --> 35:37.060]  We associate burnout with work, but that's not the only cause.
[35:37.160 --> 35:39.500]  Any of our roles in life can lead us to feel burned out.
[35:40.040 --> 35:43.200]  BetterHelp Online Therapy wants to remind you to prioritize yourself.
[35:43.720 --> 35:46.860]  Talking to someone can help you figure out what's causing stress in your life.
[35:47.880 --> 35:50.720]  Therapy has been a super beneficial thing to me.
[35:52.460 --> 35:55.440]  It's just being able to talk with somebody and sort through your issues.
[35:55.880 --> 35:58.240]  It makes such a big impact in my day to day
[35:58.240 --> 36:03.320]  and creating systems and just learning the limits of where I will hit
[36:03.320 --> 36:06.700]  with burnout, knowing when I need to step away, which is something I struggle with.
[36:06.920 --> 36:10.520]  If you're somebody who's considered therapy, based on my experience,
[36:10.660 --> 36:11.640]  I would highly recommend it.
[36:11.700 --> 36:14.120]  It has made a tremendous impact in my life.
[36:14.820 --> 36:17.600]  BetterHelp is customized online therapy that offers video, phone
[36:17.600 --> 36:19.560]  and even live chat sessions with your therapist.

[36:37.640 --> 36:39.080]  Ever heard of data brokers?
[36:39.460 --> 36:42.260]  They're the middlemen collecting and selling all those digital footprints
[36:42.260 --> 36:43.060]  you leave online.
[36:43.560 --> 36:46.960]  They can stitch together detailed profiles, which include your browsing history,
[36:47.160 --> 36:48.940]  online searches and location data.
[36:49.320 --> 36:53.240]  They then sell your profile off to a company who delivers you a targeted ad.
[36:53.640 --> 36:54.320]  No biggie, right?
[36:54.700 --> 36:56.960]  Well, you might be surprised to learn that the same data brokers
[36:56.960 --> 37:00.120]  are also selling your information to the Department of Homeland Security
[37:00.120 --> 37:01.400]  and the IRS.
[37:02.100 --> 37:04.560]  I, for one, don't want the tax man showing up at my door
[37:04.560 --> 37:06.280]  because of some search I did on my phone.
[37:06.800 --> 37:10.500]  So to mask my digital footprints, I protect myself with ExpressVPN.
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.580]  One of the easiest ways for brokers to aggregate data and tie it back
[37:14.580 --> 37:16.860]  to you is through your device's unique IP address,
[37:17.200 --> 37:19.500]  which also reveals information about your location.
[37:20.100 --> 37:22.860]  When you're connected to ExpressVPN, your IP address is hidden.
[37:23.320 --> 37:26.840]  That makes it much more difficult for data brokers to identify who you are.
[37:27.500 --> 37:30.700]  ExpressVPN also encrypts 100% of network traffic
[37:30.700 --> 37:34.200]  that keep your data safe from hackers on public Wi-Fi.
[37:34.760 --> 37:38.320]  That's why I have the ExpressVPN app downloaded on all my devices,
[37:38.820 --> 37:41.360]  phone, computer and even my home Wi-Fi router.
[37:41.800 --> 37:44.620]  All I do is tap one button to turn it on and I'm protected.
[37:44.860 --> 37:45.740]  It's that easy.
[37:46.360 --> 37:49.080]  So make sure your online activity and data is protected
[37:49.080 --> 37:51.000]  with the best VPN money can buy.

[39:25.100 --> 39:26.200]  Oh, that's incredible.
[39:26.300 --> 39:27.900]  Did you take a photo of the Bruce?
[39:28.380 --> 39:29.720]  No, I didn't think to see.
[39:29.780 --> 39:30.660]  Oh, that's where you and I are.
[39:30.800 --> 39:34.340]  If I got fucking bit by a swan, I'm putting that on my wall.
[39:34.420 --> 39:35.520]  I want a photo of that.
[39:35.960 --> 39:38.060]  I had like another 30 minutes on the jet ski,
[39:38.100 --> 39:39.660]  and then we had the whole conversation with the guy.
[39:39.740 --> 39:41.240]  And then before you knew it, and then we ate lunch.
[39:41.260 --> 39:42.600]  And before I knew it, it was. Yeah.
[39:43.440 --> 39:46.100]  I forgot. I don't get back out there and try and take it out.
[39:46.880 --> 39:48.220]  I don't want anything to do with it.
[39:48.420 --> 39:50.180]  I learned I learned Emily's lesson.
[39:50.440 --> 39:53.100]  Yeah, I'm staying away from swans.
[39:54.380 --> 39:55.560]  She was fine, by the way.
[39:55.660 --> 39:56.460]  Swan didn't bite her.
[39:56.920 --> 39:58.620]  I provided a meat shield for her
[39:59.660 --> 40:01.200]  for her normal swan viewing.
[40:02.040 --> 40:05.580]  That was that's funny, because if you were on the shore watching that happen,
[40:05.740 --> 40:09.940]  you would be rolling around on the floor laughing at the poor dude getting bit by a swan.
[40:09.940 --> 40:11.500]  Oh my god, are you kidding?
[40:11.640 --> 40:14.140]  That'd be the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.
[40:16.400 --> 40:20.320]  Oh, I'm just hoping so much on the on the Austin subreddit.
[40:20.420 --> 40:22.600]  Someone just post the security footage and then die.
[40:29.260 --> 40:32.220]  I would love security footage like that.
[40:32.340 --> 40:33.740]  Like I'm on a tick tock.
[40:33.840 --> 40:35.480]  I never know. I never knew it was recorded.
[40:38.860 --> 40:42.100]  I want to see that swan run a 40 based on what you said,
[40:42.160 --> 40:44.640]  like we need to get the clocks out, we need to time it.
[40:44.640 --> 40:45.760]  I want to know where it was.
[40:45.860 --> 40:47.680]  I'm going to Google swans max speed.
[40:47.820 --> 40:48.620]  It was so fast.
[40:48.960 --> 40:53.180]  Last week, last week, you said you're not a big you're not a jet ski guy.
[40:53.280 --> 40:54.420]  Like you wouldn't get on a jet ski.
[40:54.680 --> 40:55.980]  Yeah, not naturally.
[40:56.380 --> 40:59.300]  And now maybe even one, maybe even more so now.
[40:59.940 --> 41:00.920]  I think so.
[41:00.940 --> 41:04.200]  You know what? This is the problem with what Geoff just said.
[41:04.540 --> 41:07.380]  If I was invited to ride on the jet ski, I'd never want to be on it.
[41:07.380 --> 41:11.300]  Out of the possibility, I could watch him getting attacked by a swan,
[41:11.860 --> 41:13.180]  which is infinitely better.
[41:13.180 --> 41:14.840]  I don't care how much fun jet skis are.
[41:15.300 --> 41:18.020]  I you could not convince me that it would be more enjoyable
[41:18.020 --> 41:20.540]  than watching you get attacked by a swan.
[41:20.940 --> 41:21.580]  But you'd be incredible.
[41:21.820 --> 41:23.700]  You'd get a great view from the other jet ski.
[41:23.960 --> 41:26.200]  No, I don't. I don't know.
[41:26.440 --> 41:28.500]  I watched him jump over a dead deer once.
[41:29.760 --> 41:31.320]  I forgot about that.
[41:31.360 --> 41:32.760]  A lot happens on the water, man.
[41:36.460 --> 41:40.240]  What happens is he stays at sea and nobody thinks that's going to get attacked
[41:40.240 --> 41:44.380]  by a swan like that's never in the list of possible things that could cover.
[41:44.720 --> 41:46.800]  I like the guy that's definitely not a jet ski guy.
[41:46.980 --> 41:49.760]  It's the same guy that wanted us to joust on jet skis.
[41:50.840 --> 41:53.800]  Well, I was co-opting that idea, wasn't I?
[41:54.200 --> 41:57.540]  I thought Geoff wanted to do a cool high five and then it evolved.
[41:58.520 --> 41:58.840]  Let's do it.
[41:58.880 --> 42:00.060]  Because that's that's still in the works.
[42:00.140 --> 42:02.200]  We're talking about what jet ski tricks would be.
[42:02.540 --> 42:05.280]  And then I think because you had an issue about it being unsafe.
[42:05.280 --> 42:11.540]  And so I suggested to to just like poles with a foam hand on the end of each.
[42:11.780 --> 42:13.260]  And then you you ride by.
[42:13.400 --> 42:14.520]  You do the high five with the joust.
[42:15.080 --> 42:16.920]  I also watch it as a sport, but.
[42:18.720 --> 42:19.520]  That's amazing.
[42:19.960 --> 42:23.140]  I would I think I would be radically changed by that experience, Geoff.
[42:23.240 --> 42:25.200]  I think it would be a marker in my life.
[42:25.520 --> 42:28.340]  Like when I if I was playing like a trivia game
[42:28.340 --> 42:31.820]  and the question was, did this move like what was this movie
[42:31.820 --> 42:33.820]  that came out 2022 starring Brad Pitt?
[42:33.820 --> 42:37.980]  I would then associate was that pre swan bite, post swan bite.
[42:38.320 --> 42:42.140]  Like it would be a marker for the rest of my life of like how I could define time.
[42:42.480 --> 42:46.700]  Dude, I will admit I was a little like legitimately shook
[42:46.700 --> 42:49.100]  for maybe thirty five minutes.
[42:49.860 --> 42:54.800]  But by the time I was eating at Hula Hut with Emily laughing about it,
[42:54.820 --> 42:57.640]  I was so fucking excited for today, for this moment.
[42:57.700 --> 42:59.860]  I was like, I cannot wait.
[43:00.100 --> 43:02.720]  I cannot wait to tell this fucking story.
[43:03.340 --> 43:05.500]  When when regulation animation comes out,
[43:05.560 --> 43:07.880]  it's going to be exclusively about you on the water.
[43:09.700 --> 43:11.220]  I think it's some sort.
[43:11.440 --> 43:13.380]  Oh, this is going to be so good animated.
[43:13.600 --> 43:17.440]  Dude, I didn't realize I was as much how much of a water guy I was
[43:17.440 --> 43:18.520]  until Eric brought it up.
[43:18.600 --> 43:19.100]  But it's true.
[43:19.240 --> 43:21.280]  I didn't I didn't go in the water for like a decade.
[43:21.700 --> 43:23.120]  But now I guess I'm making up for lost time.
[43:23.380 --> 43:24.820]  It is so much fucking fun.
[43:25.360 --> 43:27.340]  Because you were a surfer before, right?
[43:27.440 --> 43:30.000]  I surfed. Yeah, I used to surf in my twenties.
[43:30.100 --> 43:31.200]  Yeah, I guess that's true.
[43:31.200 --> 43:33.900]  Yeah. Yeah, I fucking love.
[43:34.020 --> 43:34.940]  Oh, I want to know.
[43:35.080 --> 43:36.800]  I go to Barton Springs every weekend right now.
[43:36.880 --> 43:38.420]  I go to deep pool every weekend.
[43:38.960 --> 43:39.920]  I need a pool.
[43:40.400 --> 43:43.580]  So surfing is one of those things to me that it doesn't look like it should work.
[43:43.740 --> 43:47.060]  Like I don't understand anything about the physics of it.
[43:47.400 --> 43:51.340]  Yeah, it's very intimidating to look at to be like in my mid 30s
[43:51.880 --> 43:53.400]  and have never surfed.
[43:53.400 --> 43:54.880]  And I just watch people surf all the time.
[43:54.900 --> 43:56.600]  And I'm like, it's too late now.
[43:56.700 --> 43:57.740]  Can't get into surfing now.
[43:58.020 --> 43:59.960]  You think so? You think you've passed your moment?
[43:59.960 --> 44:01.280]  Oh, yeah, I think so.
[44:01.640 --> 44:03.140]  Why? What happened?
[44:03.520 --> 44:04.600]  What was the thing that changed?
[44:04.700 --> 44:05.800]  I just don't believe in it.
[44:06.020 --> 44:09.540]  Dude, Eric brings up a good point.
[44:09.940 --> 44:13.840]  He found out over the I think yesterday we were recording that other podcast.
[44:13.980 --> 44:18.840]  I do. And we found out that Gus, our mutual friend from the day job,
[44:18.940 --> 44:20.180]  Gus knows how to surf.
[44:20.680 --> 44:23.320]  And if you know Gus, you know he's like the least coordinated human on Earth.
[44:23.520 --> 44:28.120]  So if Gus could surf at all ever, you could surf at night.
[44:28.180 --> 44:29.380]  You could learn how to surf at 98.
[44:29.380 --> 44:30.480]  You'll be fine.
[44:30.720 --> 44:31.820]  Gus could surf.
[44:32.000 --> 44:32.680]  He could fly.
[44:32.800 --> 44:33.720]  He could do weddings.
[44:33.960 --> 44:34.760]  He could do everything.
[44:35.120 --> 44:36.220]  He's a renaissance man.
[44:37.140 --> 44:37.760]  Oh, man.
[44:38.020 --> 44:39.340]  You know what I found out this weekend?
[44:39.780 --> 44:41.620]  Not everybody knows how to dive.
[44:42.160 --> 44:42.740]  What do you mean?
[44:43.200 --> 44:44.700]  Well, you have to learn how to dive.
[44:44.860 --> 44:46.500]  But you have to learn how to swim.
[44:46.740 --> 44:49.960]  Like, like, don't you learn how to dive as a part of learning how to swim?
[44:50.180 --> 44:51.400]  It's like day three or something.
[44:51.880 --> 44:53.740]  Nah, I feel like you jump in first.
[44:54.180 --> 44:57.720]  We were on the top of this double-decker boat
[44:57.720 --> 45:02.720]  and everyone's jumping in and just like going feet first and cannonball and all this stuff.
[45:03.400 --> 45:08.960]  Geoff, like, jumps in the air, looks like he touches his toes,
[45:09.640 --> 45:12.300]  jackknifes in, no splash,
[45:12.880 --> 45:15.040]  poof, right up back to the top and everything.
[45:15.300 --> 45:17.940]  And it's everyone standing on the upper deck going,
[45:18.280 --> 45:19.460]  whoa, that was awesome.
[45:19.540 --> 45:20.020]  That's cool.
[45:20.160 --> 45:22.240]  And then Geoff's going, everyone knows how to dive.
[45:22.600 --> 45:23.080]  What do you mean?
[45:23.260 --> 45:24.440]  Everyone knows how to dive.
[45:24.660 --> 45:25.780]  And nobody knows how to dive.
[45:25.820 --> 45:26.640]  What are you talking about?
[45:26.640 --> 45:28.200]  Blew my mind.
[45:29.020 --> 45:30.200]  Blew my fucking mind.
[45:30.620 --> 45:33.960]  I have a very important, was this before or after the swan bite?
[45:34.680 --> 45:36.560]  This was after, this was Sunday, a swan bite.
[45:36.620 --> 45:41.760]  So is it possible that post swan bite, you're like 20% more graceful than you were before?
[45:41.880 --> 45:46.120]  Do you think you would have achieved swan stride off the swan?
[45:46.360 --> 45:47.740]  Was it a swan dive?
[45:48.100 --> 45:51.600]  Were you tapping into your new connection that you've formed?
[45:51.720 --> 45:54.200]  I'm like, I'm like the swan version of a werewolf now.
[45:54.200 --> 45:55.160]  Yeah, exactly.
[45:57.340 --> 45:59.080]  No, what was even funnier is,
[46:00.700 --> 46:04.500]  I really, I'm honestly, I just I remember I learned how to swim at the YMCA
[46:04.500 --> 46:07.100]  when I was like eight, and I just remember that was a part of it.
[46:07.380 --> 46:09.400]  So I just assumed everybody,
[46:10.560 --> 46:13.560]  everybody else learned how to swim in Oregon in the 80s in the same way I did.
[46:14.620 --> 46:18.780]  But I will say Emily posted like a video of the day of like of us,
[46:19.000 --> 46:20.360]  everybody jumping and diving and stuff.
[46:20.480 --> 46:23.740]  And my mom texted me out of the blue and said, when did you learn how to dive?
[46:26.520 --> 46:28.160]  I was like, are you fucking serious?
[46:28.780 --> 46:31.080]  So I guess I was just fucking super ignorant.
[46:31.220 --> 46:33.780]  I had no, I apologize to all the non divers.
[46:33.980 --> 46:35.000]  I really didn't know.
[46:35.420 --> 46:39.300]  You dove from the top of the boat through an inner tube.
[46:40.240 --> 46:44.680]  Yeah, and the sand was like, yeah, it was like perfect.
[46:45.000 --> 46:45.980]  It was super impressive.
[46:46.640 --> 46:47.400]  Oh, thank you.
[46:47.760 --> 46:49.940]  I tried later on and I hit my forehead on it.
[46:52.220 --> 46:54.120]  Gavin fucking dive bombed it.
[46:56.640 --> 47:00.160]  Because anyone can dive if you classify diving as jumping
[47:00.160 --> 47:03.400]  and then going upside down, you don't have all the grace.
[47:05.220 --> 47:06.760]  You haven't been bitten by a swan yet.
[47:07.020 --> 47:08.700]  It's not your fault. It's true.
[47:09.140 --> 47:13.440]  Gavin, we can, we can, here's how we can make it bitten by a large boulder.
[47:13.860 --> 47:16.380]  I need you to follow me on Friday.
[47:16.460 --> 47:17.660]  We're going to go on down to the lake.
[47:17.720 --> 47:19.300]  We're going to get you bit by a swan.
[47:19.440 --> 47:21.760]  By Sunday, you're going to be Greg Louganis.
[47:22.200 --> 47:26.600]  Could, in all seriousness, you need to track that swan down again.
[47:26.720 --> 47:27.920]  We need a photo of that swan.
[47:27.920 --> 47:33.840]  I have no fear that I could or no, like I have 100% certainty
[47:33.840 --> 47:35.660]  I could get back to that swan and it'll be there.
[47:35.980 --> 47:39.980]  Dude, I want to sit on the back of your jet ski facing the other way
[47:39.980 --> 47:44.000]  with a slow-mo camera and it'll be the most epic footage ever filmed.
[47:44.000 --> 47:44.680]  Of the swan coming at us?
[47:44.920 --> 47:45.940]  Yeah. Oh, please.
[47:46.520 --> 47:48.100]  100%. We got to be so good.
[47:49.000 --> 47:49.440]  Absolutely.
[47:50.080 --> 47:52.160]  Let's do that very soon.
[47:52.580 --> 47:53.740]  Do you have a little slide?
[47:53.820 --> 47:54.640]  Like, you don't want to take the...
[47:54.640 --> 47:56.600]  I'm sure you don't want to take your Phantom out on a jet ski,
[47:56.680 --> 47:57.980]  but you have like a smaller handheld.
[47:59.060 --> 48:02.180]  Uh, I mean, the smallest one is the one I filmed your bike stunt on.
[48:02.640 --> 48:03.340]  Oh, OK.
[48:03.740 --> 48:06.760]  I mean, if you want to take it to the middle of Lake Austin, we can do that.
[48:07.320 --> 48:11.740]  Yeah, Eric, I need a large insurance policy from the credit card.
[48:12.540 --> 48:13.180]  Sure, whatever.
[48:16.060 --> 48:17.260]  We'll wrap it in plastic.
[48:17.720 --> 48:18.780]  Yeah, there you go. Insurance.
[48:18.780 --> 48:22.500]  I guarantee you that swan will be there and I guarantee you I can get it.
[48:22.640 --> 48:26.580]  All I have to do to get the swan to come after us is to make a look at it.
[48:32.780 --> 48:34.640]  Oh, I'm so excited for this.
[48:34.760 --> 48:36.600]  I'll have a McDonald's bag on my head.
[48:43.500 --> 48:46.840]  And they're like, how did that guy get his arm cut off again?
[48:47.220 --> 48:47.960]  Swan fight.
[48:49.760 --> 48:51.460]  Swan fight. Oh.
[48:52.460 --> 48:54.480]  Yeah, I don't think a butterfly net would work for the swan.
[48:54.620 --> 48:55.920]  I need I need something bigger.
[48:56.300 --> 48:58.040]  I think that's all I ever heard about swans as a kid.
[48:58.120 --> 49:00.320]  It's like, oh, don't mess with a swan. They'll break your arm.
[49:00.640 --> 49:01.700]  I just don't really understand how.
[49:02.740 --> 49:03.960]  Specifically, that's their.
[49:04.160 --> 49:07.560]  No, I didn't know that they had a finishing move like they fucking knew jujitsu.
[49:07.960 --> 49:10.400]  You said that like they throw you into arm bars.
[49:10.540 --> 49:11.560]  And that's the same for you.
[49:11.780 --> 49:12.860]  What are you talking about?
[49:13.320 --> 49:14.500]  Yeah, it's just I heard a lot.
[49:14.860 --> 49:15.680]  And everyone said it.
[49:15.860 --> 49:16.600]  All swans know Krav Maga.
[49:17.140 --> 49:19.500]  It's like one of those things that like all kids hear about.
[49:19.580 --> 49:22.140]  And then they just move that information on to the next person.
[49:22.140 --> 49:23.040]  Like, oh, yeah, yeah.
[49:23.080 --> 49:23.900]  Swan will break your arm.
[49:24.400 --> 49:27.220]  Has anyone seen a swan break anyone's arm if it's 30 pounds?
[49:28.240 --> 49:29.580]  Do swans... I will look that up.
[49:29.920 --> 49:31.380]  Do swans break arms?
[49:32.140 --> 49:33.900]  Do swans break arms?
[49:33.900 --> 49:35.520]  Dude, it's 60 miles an hour at night.
[49:36.340 --> 49:37.440]  Do swans break...
[49:37.440 --> 49:40.000]  If you approach a swan nest on the river.
[49:40.120 --> 49:40.960]  Holy fuck.
[49:41.060 --> 49:43.420]  Imagine accidentally going into the swan nest.
[49:43.760 --> 49:44.420]  That's terrifying.
[49:45.060 --> 49:45.940]  Comment leavers.
[49:46.240 --> 49:48.860]  If you're if you're a regulation listener about to turn
[49:48.860 --> 49:50.220]  or if you're a regulation comment leaver.
[49:50.220 --> 49:51.840]  Oh, wait, a normal comment.
[49:52.040 --> 49:53.900]  What? Let me know if you've had a comment.
[49:54.040 --> 49:56.060]  Let me know if you've seen a swan break anyone's arm.
[49:56.420 --> 49:59.180]  Or if you've has has a swan ever attacked you.
[49:59.260 --> 50:00.160]  Did it break your arm?
[50:00.240 --> 50:01.200]  Did it sprain your ankle?
[50:01.540 --> 50:02.680]  Anything? Let us know.
[50:03.020 --> 50:05.480]  They might get aggressive and hiss and flap their wings.
[50:05.500 --> 50:07.040]  But the danger is overrated.
[50:07.040 --> 50:10.100]  And it's a myth that they will break your leg or arm with their wings.
[50:10.500 --> 50:11.540]  They are not that strong.
[50:11.620 --> 50:13.260]  And it's mostly show and bluster.
[50:14.300 --> 50:15.280]  Yeah, I'm somebody.
[50:15.880 --> 50:20.000]  Somebody tell that somebody tell that to the fucking terror of Lake Austin.
[50:24.020 --> 50:27.680]  I think we should go out there, find the swan and not come home
[50:27.680 --> 50:30.620]  until Geoff's arm is broken off.
[50:34.960 --> 50:35.920]  Oh, man.
[50:36.340 --> 50:37.660]  You became the guy.
[50:38.200 --> 50:39.220]  Yeah, it goes full circle.
[50:39.360 --> 50:42.880]  There's somebody else on the water that gets told about some weird arm
[50:42.880 --> 50:45.400]  break that was removed that you have no context for.
[50:45.480 --> 50:47.520]  You could be the guy that could be you.
[50:47.920 --> 50:49.960]  Dude, speaking of fucking dumb guys.
[50:50.220 --> 50:53.480]  There was a story in this lake.
[50:54.200 --> 50:58.080]  There was a story that happened like maybe four or five months ago.
[50:58.320 --> 51:01.740]  Eric and Nick and Gavin may have heard this, although I doubt Gavin has
[51:01.740 --> 51:02.520]  because he doesn't hear much.
[51:03.120 --> 51:08.300]  But this dude, I just I don't think he was like plugged into like local
[51:08.300 --> 51:10.200]  America, like like Austin shit.
[51:10.420 --> 51:11.560]  Maybe it doesn't concern me.
[51:11.720 --> 51:13.060]  You're more international. Exactly. See?
[51:13.420 --> 51:16.600]  So we have this thing called the 360 Bridge.
[51:16.740 --> 51:19.840]  It's like it looks like a I don't know, like a mini Golden Gate Bridge.
[51:19.840 --> 51:22.700]  Well, not really. It's like it's a half circle,
[51:23.220 --> 51:25.620]  but it's like our version of a nice bridge.
[51:25.640 --> 51:27.160]  It goes right over Lake Austin.
[51:27.620 --> 51:30.880]  It's actually where sometimes we we go in with the jet skis,
[51:30.900 --> 51:32.120]  depending on where they're putting in that day.
[51:33.080 --> 51:35.860]  And it is at the very top
[51:36.320 --> 51:40.720]  from the very, very top of the like of the of the circular part of the bridge.
[51:40.780 --> 51:42.880]  I guess like the aesthetic part of the bridge.
[51:43.440 --> 51:47.100]  It is eight feet shorter than the Golden Gate Bridge.
[51:47.100 --> 51:50.960]  And so it's incredibly dangerous to jump off of,
[51:51.240 --> 51:53.840]  because as you know, the Golden Gate Bridge, you'll die if you jump off of it.
[51:54.160 --> 51:56.660]  And apparently that eight feet makes a big difference.
[51:57.200 --> 52:00.080]  Some fucking like 22 year old dude or some young dude in Austin
[52:00.080 --> 52:03.140]  climbed up there as a prank and filmed it.
[52:03.220 --> 52:04.120]  I think it was even on Instagram.
[52:04.460 --> 52:05.640]  Yeah, there's the bridge in the photos.
[52:06.320 --> 52:10.000]  He climbed up to the top of that and filmed himself jumping off.
[52:10.320 --> 52:12.400]  And he didn't die. He almost died.
[52:12.600 --> 52:14.340]  I think that eight feet saved his life, they were saying.
[52:14.340 --> 52:17.040]  But he did like get a concussion and crack his head open.
[52:17.180 --> 52:20.100]  And he needed, I think, some kind of fucking brain surgery and stuff.
[52:20.360 --> 52:20.980]  Like it was a whole thing.
[52:21.100 --> 52:23.620]  And they were interviewing him in.
[52:23.840 --> 52:24.760]  Oh yeah, I've seen Nick heard about this.
[52:24.900 --> 52:28.280]  They were interviewing him for like the statesman or whatever afterward.
[52:28.420 --> 52:31.220]  And they asked him in the hospital, like, do you have any messages
[52:31.220 --> 52:33.160]  to anybody else that may try something like this?
[52:33.480 --> 52:35.600]  And he goes, keep following your dreams.
[52:41.550 --> 52:45.530]  Well, I guess he had a lot of time for a lot of them while his head was cracked open.
[52:45.530 --> 52:46.410]  Yeah, no kidding.
[52:46.490 --> 52:47.070]  It's fantastic.
[52:47.830 --> 52:48.690]  Keep following your dreams.
[52:48.790 --> 52:50.890]  I laugh about that every time I see that bridge now.
[52:51.430 --> 52:52.670]  Eric posted his quote.
[52:53.630 --> 52:55.530]  Oh, I did not mean to go and jump off a bridge.
[52:55.650 --> 52:59.110]  I have a big fucking ego and I know I'm capable of hopefully there's been motivation
[52:59.110 --> 53:01.890]  now by me jumping off of a bridge to show off and say the same.
[53:01.990 --> 53:05.630]  But you find something within you that motivates you go chase after your own dreams.
[53:06.410 --> 53:07.910]  Like he's a fucking hero.
[53:08.130 --> 53:09.830]  Like he's inspired a nation.
[53:10.070 --> 53:11.870]  He's inspired a nation by almost dying.
[53:12.110 --> 53:12.570]  There he is.
[53:12.570 --> 53:14.110]  Oh, my God.
[53:14.150 --> 53:15.010]  In a neck brace.
[53:16.310 --> 53:20.330]  Oh, by the way, the the fucking swan is like
[53:20.970 --> 53:23.430]  the distance from the bridge to the end of the photo.
[53:23.570 --> 53:25.610]  That much further right is where the swan is.
[53:26.770 --> 53:27.590]  It's pretty close.
[53:27.610 --> 53:29.350]  It's pretty close to that location in that.
[53:29.630 --> 53:30.210]  It's exciting.
[53:30.830 --> 53:32.270]  I cannot wait for the swan update.
[53:32.770 --> 53:38.470]  Yeah, we have enough locations now for a face tour book like a guidebook.
[53:40.110 --> 53:41.270]  Go to the swan.
[53:41.270 --> 53:44.590]  You can walk through the snake bushes and find baseballs.
[53:45.470 --> 53:47.150]  The fucking face guide to Austin.
[53:47.530 --> 53:51.590]  Yeah, it's like that's not for tourists guides like the real Austin.
[53:51.850 --> 53:55.630]  Here's where you get pushed off your bike by the gentle ghost.
[53:58.250 --> 54:00.270]  Here's where you can do a sweet bike trick.
[54:02.370 --> 54:04.550]  And here's where bean holes don't work.
[54:08.570 --> 54:09.690]  Oh, Christ.
[54:10.990 --> 54:13.630]  Oh, so we had a conversation
[54:14.290 --> 54:17.570]  about how we've talked about the anal passage shirt so much.
[54:17.650 --> 54:18.510]  We need to put it to bed.
[54:18.770 --> 54:23.390]  We know we agreed before so many, so many consecutive episodes.
[54:23.750 --> 54:26.770]  I did. I got my anal passage shirt, though.
[54:26.970 --> 54:29.990]  And I had a realization when I was looking at it, something
[54:29.990 --> 54:33.310]  pieced together in my mind, and I can't unsee it now.
[54:33.390 --> 54:36.110]  And I'm hoping it will do the same for you.
[54:36.110 --> 54:40.130]  Have you noticed the giant dick on the anal passage shirt?
[54:40.590 --> 54:42.810]  No. Let me post it.
[54:43.290 --> 54:45.470]  I can't believe I'm about to Google anal passage.
[54:45.650 --> 54:47.730]  Oh, that's not. Yeah, that's not.
[54:47.730 --> 54:49.050]  So here's the here's the logo.
[54:49.290 --> 54:50.650]  Do you see the dick yet?
[54:51.210 --> 54:52.830]  Oh, at the top, the cock at the top.
[54:53.230 --> 54:55.050]  Yeah, it's a dick with cock balls.
[54:55.290 --> 54:56.250]  That's all I see now.
[54:56.770 --> 54:57.590]  Is that original?
[54:57.990 --> 54:59.490]  Like Eric said, that was the universal logo.
[54:59.770 --> 55:00.250]  I believe so.
[55:00.590 --> 55:02.510]  Just, you know, in case in case you missed it.
[55:02.530 --> 55:04.130]  I did a nice little circle for you there.
[55:04.130 --> 55:06.210]  I really focus in. Dick and balls.
[55:06.330 --> 55:08.850]  Every time I see that now, that's all I see. Dick and balls.
[55:10.010 --> 55:12.910]  Oh, yeah. Universal Studios Hollywood has the dick and balls.
[55:13.150 --> 55:14.410]  Oh, my God. Dick and balls.
[55:14.950 --> 55:15.370]  That's amazing.
[55:15.490 --> 55:18.190]  By the way, don't Google anal passage.
[55:19.210 --> 55:21.690]  Don't Google image search anal passage f*** face.
[55:22.510 --> 55:24.110]  Or anal passage dick and balls.
[55:24.270 --> 55:25.170]  It's probably not as convenient.
[55:25.730 --> 55:28.630]  It does not get you where you want to go.
[55:28.970 --> 55:29.550]  I just I didn't.
[55:29.630 --> 55:32.690]  I'm glad you you both saw it because I didn't know because I had the same thing
[55:33.130 --> 55:34.770]  when Slack changed its logo.
[55:35.110 --> 55:38.730]  And I didn't feel I feel like I didn't really hear many other people talk about it.
[55:38.850 --> 55:42.030]  All I see is four dicks and balls pointed in every direction.
[55:42.190 --> 55:42.810]  Ready to go.
[55:43.150 --> 55:44.470]  That's all I see.
[55:44.710 --> 55:46.290]  That's all I've ever seen.
[55:46.690 --> 55:50.510]  And every whenever I look at the Slack app, it's just like four dicks
[55:50.510 --> 55:51.690]  covering all angles.
[55:53.250 --> 55:54.770]  Oh, that's bold.
[55:55.170 --> 55:59.030]  Hashmark new four dicks coming at you from all sides.
[55:59.350 --> 56:00.790]  It's only one ball, though.
[56:01.170 --> 56:01.670]  Perky ball.
[56:01.670 --> 56:02.910]  Well, it's a profile photo.
[56:03.130 --> 56:04.230]  It's a side. It's a profile.
[56:04.370 --> 56:05.470]  Yeah. Oh, I see.
[56:05.810 --> 56:08.170]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[56:08.490 --> 56:09.910]  So that's awful.
[56:10.610 --> 56:13.850]  That's what I was worried that when I showed the
[56:14.730 --> 56:19.150]  the the the anal passage dick that I would be the only one that saw it
[56:19.150 --> 56:20.430]  because I knew it was like a Slack thing.
[56:20.530 --> 56:22.090]  But I'm glad that you saw it.
[56:22.490 --> 56:23.250]  What were you going to say, Gab?
[56:23.610 --> 56:24.370]  Oh, I don't know.
[56:26.410 --> 56:27.550]  Oh, so what were you talking about?
[56:28.130 --> 56:30.890]  Which one of which one successfully put this shirt to bed,
[56:30.890 --> 56:32.290]  but it's too successful to do so?
[56:32.530 --> 56:36.030]  Well, I just meant like us talking about it just like
[56:36.030 --> 56:37.770]  because we've brought it up so many times.
[56:37.910 --> 56:42.550]  It's like, yeah, like this week's episode aired and everybody was talking about it.
[56:42.550 --> 56:43.410]  So I wouldn't listen to it.
[56:43.450 --> 56:47.310]  And then Nick posted next week's episode and I started to prove that.
[56:47.710 --> 56:49.450]  And we start talking about it like in the first five minutes.
[56:49.670 --> 56:52.870]  And so as I was being funny when I came into pleasantries, I said, hey,
[56:52.890 --> 56:55.490]  can we agree not to talk about the anal passage shirt this week?
[56:55.830 --> 56:57.190]  Because it's been like five weeks in a row.
[56:57.330 --> 56:59.470]  And then he goes, I have something to say about it.
[56:59.470 --> 57:03.270]  I had the same thought at the exact same, but it's just this last insight.
[57:03.390 --> 57:08.830]  So now on the on the four dicks and balls app, someone in in March said,
[57:09.070 --> 57:11.770]  well, originally they were sort of posting updates
[57:11.770 --> 57:14.310]  as we were climbing towards the top of the shirt list.
[57:14.390 --> 57:16.130]  We were like at number three and then number two.
[57:16.210 --> 57:20.090]  And now the update was we're stomping on the grave of the number two shirt
[57:20.090 --> 57:22.390]  in terms of how many shirts we've sold.
[57:23.930 --> 57:24.770]  So stupid.
[57:25.610 --> 57:26.950]  We have an amazing community.
[57:27.390 --> 57:28.990]  We do. So good.
[57:29.950 --> 57:31.630]  Oh, it's just the most amazing.
[57:32.090 --> 57:32.890]  I haven't actually asked.
[57:33.130 --> 57:36.930]  I haven't talked to Jack properly about how he really feels about it.
[57:37.150 --> 57:38.850]  I feel like we've gotten a good read from Geoff.
[57:39.290 --> 57:41.710]  Yeah, he's had enough time now that he'll he'll be OK.
[57:42.530 --> 57:43.630]  I'm sure. I hope so.
[57:43.670 --> 57:45.290]  I got to fucking go to Florida with him in two days.
[57:47.470 --> 57:49.550]  You're not recording one of these for like a while.
[57:49.910 --> 57:50.470]  One of these?
[57:51.030 --> 57:53.430]  Well, we're thinking like, you know, you know how we're currently doing a show
[57:53.430 --> 57:54.450]  and not just hanging out.
[57:54.890 --> 57:56.650]  Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[57:56.730 --> 57:58.290]  Eric, we've been hanging out so much recently.
[57:58.290 --> 57:59.410]  It's hot. It's true.
[58:01.790 --> 58:05.210]  Yeah. Geoff is gone like this week, next week.
[58:05.330 --> 58:08.190]  So we aren't recording again until like June.
[58:09.050 --> 58:10.690]  June? Really? Oh, fuck.
[58:10.870 --> 58:13.490]  Well, maybe we could maybe we could record sometime next week,
[58:13.550 --> 58:15.670]  like early before I go out of town. Let's do it.
[58:15.970 --> 58:17.130]  We can do Tuesday, I guess.
[58:17.550 --> 58:19.150]  We can figure this out after the show.
[58:19.530 --> 58:21.530]  No, no, there's no time like the present.
[58:21.790 --> 58:23.630]  You are you Monday and Wednesday.
[58:23.790 --> 58:27.030]  You are busy. You are free Tuesday afternoon.
[58:27.030 --> 58:31.670]  If I am all all all about Gavin face next.
[58:31.710 --> 58:32.710]  How's your Tuesday afternoon?
[58:34.430 --> 58:35.190]  Looking, looking.
[58:37.910 --> 58:39.930]  Oh, open, completely open.
[58:40.250 --> 58:43.210]  You want to do three o'clock or is that going to press some people
[58:43.210 --> 58:45.550]  with the time they have to be done with things?
[58:45.970 --> 58:48.730]  Three is fine. Three is great for me. Yeah. OK, cool. Great.
[58:48.990 --> 58:51.590]  By the way, Eric, you've gotten so much better at your job.
[58:51.630 --> 58:52.310]  Last time we did this.
[58:52.410 --> 58:54.350]  Thanks, man. 30 minutes to schedule it.
[58:54.350 --> 58:55.670]  You just did that in seconds.
[58:56.310 --> 58:57.810]  I seized the opportunity.
[58:58.090 --> 58:59.790]  I wasn't waiting to do that last time.
[59:00.130 --> 59:01.170]  Hey, what do you guys want to do?
[59:01.290 --> 59:04.530]  MVP to the thing that Geoff said we should do soon.
[59:06.290 --> 59:07.770]  Uh, yeah, exactly.
[59:09.010 --> 59:10.890]  Uh huh. Yep. Uh huh.
[59:10.930 --> 59:12.830]  I mean, I'm I can do it.
[59:12.830 --> 59:15.090]  I right. Right. You can't do it.
[59:15.510 --> 59:16.950]  I can do it Saturday, Sunday.
[59:17.370 --> 59:18.410]  Jesus Christ.
[59:21.130 --> 59:23.130]  I could do it next Tuesday, but we're recording.
[59:23.130 --> 59:29.170]  They say that one soon.
[59:29.430 --> 59:31.350]  Yes. You wouldn't you wouldn't get on a jet ski.
[59:31.450 --> 59:33.610]  Would you let me tow you on a jet ski?
[59:33.870 --> 59:35.930]  I in what context? What are we doing here?
[59:35.970 --> 59:39.730]  Am I in like a little am I in a floaty boat thing like a floaty boat?
[59:39.910 --> 59:40.890]  You're not an inner tube.
[59:41.010 --> 59:42.370]  You're in an inflatable swan.
[59:42.910 --> 59:45.050]  I would not if we're in swan territory.
[59:45.090 --> 59:48.370]  I do not trust you in the inner tube. No.
[59:49.770 --> 59:51.330]  If it got if I'm not.
[59:51.450 --> 59:52.490]  I love you, Gavin.
[59:52.490 --> 59:55.670]  If things got real at that swan, you're cutting that rope.
[59:55.810 --> 59:56.990]  You're leaving me behind.
[59:58.450 --> 59:59.670]  I don't trust it.
[59:59.790 --> 01:00:00.730]  I don't think I would cut.
[01:00:01.690 --> 01:00:03.690]  I think it's not like we're climbing.
[01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:08.950]  If I if it was between the Phantom or me, I'm getting left in the water.
[01:00:11.070 --> 01:00:14.670]  I'm I'm absolutely planning on buying one of these from my jet ski
[01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:15.570]  when I buy a jet ski.
[01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:18.630]  I have those all the time.
[01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:21.570]  OK, Austin, people are fucking having a blast on them.
[01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:23.570]  You get me some some pepperoni sticks.
[01:00:23.970 --> 01:00:25.070]  It's called a great big Mabel.
[01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:28.990]  And if you since it's an audio podcast and it's a it's like an inflatable sofa.
[01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:30.790]  Dude, Eric's water is Jason.
[01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:32.430]  That is very adjacent for him.
[01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:33.530]  Eric would love that.
[01:00:33.570 --> 01:00:37.030]  And he would love a bunch of dudes like leaning on it around as he was on top.
[01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:39.830]  I just think that I could definitely put a cooler on that thing
[01:00:39.830 --> 01:00:42.490]  and have a bunch of drinks while I listen to Sublime
[01:00:42.490 --> 01:00:44.050]  while sitting on the great big Mabel.
[01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:45.450]  100 percent.
[01:00:45.490 --> 01:00:48.430]  If you give me some pepperoni sticks and two butterfly nets,
[01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:49.970]  I'm ready to go into swan territory.
[01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:52.350]  That's set up. I like there's enough room to move around.
[01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:53.090]  I'm prepared.
[01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:55.630]  I need one for each arm.
[01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:56.370]  Then I'm ready.
[01:00:56.810 --> 01:00:58.250]  All right. So we're going to.
[01:00:58.450 --> 01:01:00.050]  That's how you get a swan to break your arm.
[01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:01.750]  We're going to do this.
[01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:02.990]  That's going to happen.
[01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:04.550]  I will buy a jet ski.
[01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:06.270]  I will buy a great big Mabel.
[01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:08.710]  Andrew will come to Austin at some point.
[01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:10.490]  So it will have to happen.
[01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:12.530]  I am so nervous.
[01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:17.730]  This is going from outside of the realm of like a funny potential to I want.
[01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:21.450]  Let's let's let's fucking put pen to paper and let's cement this.
[01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:22.510]  Let's do let's get this done.
[01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:24.990]  I'm willing to do the hard part and buy the jet ski.
[01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:26.390]  I yeah, I'm in.
[01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:27.270]  OK, I'm in.
[01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:28.430]  I can't wait for this.
[01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:30.270]  I can't wait to see you guys get attacked.
[01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:32.390]  I can't wait to go into swan territory myself.
[01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:34.310]  It's going to be a great time.
[01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:39.410]  I think if you're on an inflatable swan, it will make this one way more aggressive.
[01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:42.950]  Or what if you get great?
[01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:45.730]  Dude, what if you could make a swan fall in love with you?
[01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:48.970]  What if you could transfix?
[01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:49.810]  Yeah.
[01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:54.310]  What if it looks at you and it's like, it's the most gorgeous swan I've ever seen.
[01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:55.590]  What if we bring a mirror?
[01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:56.970]  What would it do?
[01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:59.110]  Would it just rush at itself?
[01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:00.530]  What would be the process?
[01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:02.310]  Would it psych itself out?
[01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:03.750]  We need to bring a giant mirror.
[01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:06.350]  That's that's you're just asking for trouble.
[01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:07.590]  That giant swan inflatable.
[01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:08.650]  Is that Photoshop?
[01:02:09.070 --> 01:02:09.910]  That's none of that's real.
[01:02:10.110 --> 01:02:11.730]  It's 100% of Photoshop.
[01:02:12.090 --> 01:02:13.910]  Not a single piece of that photo is real.
[01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:19.470]  That's the Green Goat giant inflatable swan pool float lounger.
[01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:21.830]  It in 75 inches.
[01:02:21.970 --> 01:02:22.770]  It's a biggin.
[01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:26.150]  Dude, I think if we went fast enough on the jet ski, we could get that thing to take off.
[01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:27.210]  Oh, 100%.
[01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:27.950]  You mean get it airborne?
[01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:31.290]  Oh, hold on.
[01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:32.670]  Don't worry. I found a better one.
[01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:34.410]  What if we go the other route?
[01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:38.950]  What if we intimidate the swan because we're in this?
[01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:46.570]  Oh, this one is the size of my house.
[01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:47.630]  Look at the crown.
[01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:48.950]  The queen definitely owns that one.
[01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:49.370]  Big.
[01:02:50.570 --> 01:02:55.170]  There are five people, six people on that swan with room to spare.
[01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:59.690]  I love this.
[01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:01.710]  That's going to be like a thousand dollars.
[01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:03.950]  Yeah, I would imagine.
[01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:08.170]  That's the nine foot crown wearing swan.
[01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:09.510]  All right, hold on.
[01:03:09.590 --> 01:03:12.230]  The swan banging its head on a bridge.
[01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:13.970]  I left from Sam's Club.
[01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:17.670]  You can get it right now, holds up to six people.
[01:03:17.730 --> 01:03:19.050]  Hold on. It's on Sam's Club.
[01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:22.510]  Like the snacks membership place.
[01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:24.750]  Yeah. Snacks membership place.
[01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:26.790]  Well, I'll have to find it.
[01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:31.210]  It's not showing up on the website, but that's where it was from.
[01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:32.510]  It's probably like 500 bucks.
[01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:33.130]  Wow.
[01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:35.050]  Sounds like a deal.
[01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:36.450]  Oh, here we go. Shop now.
[01:03:36.590 --> 01:03:37.230]  Hold on. Does that work?
[01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:38.910]  I spent more on a battle bus.
[01:03:39.110 --> 01:03:40.770]  This fucking swan's gone, dude.
[01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:41.990]  Oh, no. Oh.
[01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:46.930]  I'll find a plan that is that if if Sam's doesn't have an eBay, well,
[01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:47.970]  we'll we'll figure it out.
[01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:53.990]  Oh, that could be us.
[01:03:54.290 --> 01:03:58.310]  I never would have thought that we would have a swan attack episode with Geoff,
[01:03:58.370 --> 01:03:59.250]  but I'm glad we did.
[01:03:59.530 --> 01:04:00.250]  What a great time.
[01:04:00.790 --> 01:04:02.190]  I'm glad you're a water guy, Geoff.
[01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:06.890]  As Gavin said, you've brought so much great content to the show by purely being you.
[01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:08.830]  Thanks, man.
[01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:13.250]  Well, I, I am looking forward to continuing water and water
[01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:15.050]  related activities.
[01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:19.070]  So hopefully I'll have tons of new stories, non snake related stories to tell.
[01:04:21.010 --> 01:04:22.710]  I can handle just about anything else in the water.
[01:04:22.890 --> 01:04:24.150]  Just no snakes. Yeah.
[01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:25.790]  What about an octopus?
[01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:28.210]  I don't think I'm have to worry about that in Lake Austin.
[01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:30.010]  I think I'm probably safe from octopi.
[01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:34.530]  So specifically the animals in that lake, it's not all animals outside of snakes.
[01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:35.650]  You feel confident taking.
[01:04:35.650 --> 01:04:38.190]  Oh, I mean, I've spent a lot of time in the ocean
[01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:41.750]  and I've never really worried about octopi before.
[01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:47.370]  Maybe if I was like in a like a deep sea fisherman, I'd be afraid of like a giant
[01:04:48.130 --> 01:04:50.490]  prehistoric octopus like ripping my boat apart.
[01:04:50.550 --> 01:04:52.850]  But like close to shore, I think I'm probably fine.
[01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:56.370]  I think I got chased by an octopus once in the water.
[01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:57.650]  I got chased by something gross.
[01:04:58.710 --> 01:05:03.290]  What is that? Oh, Eric posted a snake inflatable snake inflatable.
[01:05:03.290 --> 01:05:05.290]  Yes, that looks like Eric.
[01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:10.130]  It does. It's that's me intimidating the other snakes.
[01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:17.430]  It but it's like it's close, but it's like Hollywood, Eric.
[01:05:17.810 --> 01:05:22.350]  Like if there is an ABC family movie that featured Eric as a character in it
[01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:26.450]  and they hired an actor to play Eric, that is absolutely Eric.
[01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:27.350]  But a little cleaned up.
[01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:30.790]  Yeah, a little bit cleaned up is pretty accurate.
[01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:35.270]  Why don't we go into Canada?
[01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:36.350]  Well, we're going to Vegas.
[01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:37.490]  I feel like you ask that every week.
[01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:38.950]  I want to go.
[01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:41.510]  I don't. Yeah.
[01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:43.110]  So do I. I want you guys to go.
[01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:44.770]  I have got a water spot.
[01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:47.490]  Love to show you guys my number one spot.
[01:05:47.550 --> 01:05:49.070]  I got a little secret water area.
[01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:50.570]  I'm very excited. My go to.
[01:05:51.050 --> 01:05:51.670]  Everyone ranking.
[01:05:52.410 --> 01:05:52.970]  Should we close this?
[01:05:53.110 --> 01:05:54.090]  How do we open the episode?
[01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:55.450]  Where did this episode start?
[01:05:57.650 --> 01:05:58.870]  Oh, that's so much pressure.
[01:05:59.190 --> 01:06:01.330]  It started with you apologizing.
[01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:04.870]  So say you're sorry to end it also, and then we'll go.
[01:06:05.130 --> 01:06:07.070]  Yeah. Apologize our way out of this.
[01:06:08.490 --> 01:06:11.510]  Kind Sir! Geoff! Gavin!
[01:06:12.330 --> 01:06:14.050]  Was that cut out of the beginning part?
[01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:14.850]  Is that going to just be cut?
[01:06:14.850 --> 01:06:17.150]  I hope so, but you should apologize for saying it again.
[01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:19.450]  Well, I apologize twice. I double apologize.
[01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:26.270]  I apologize for my apology and I apologize for the kind sir voice.
[01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:27.650]  I regret saying it.
[01:06:28.350 --> 01:06:30.070]  Are you going to go from that into the outro?
[01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:30.750]  You're just going to stop.
[01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:32.170]  Oh, I thought that was yeah.
[01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:33.650]  Thanks for listening.
[01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:36.310]  Throw five, five stars.
[01:06:36.690 --> 01:06:38.730]  Ten stars. If you don't mind, throw five.
[01:06:38.730 --> 01:06:40.130]  However many you can spare.
[01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:43.090]  As many as you have in these trying times.
[01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:45.550]  Thank you for listening.
[01:06:46.310 --> 01:06:48.710]  Yeah, we're not going to talk about the shirt anymore for a bit.
[01:06:49.650 --> 01:06:50.130]  Subscribe.
[01:06:50.850 --> 01:06:51.870]  Like we have a YouTube channel.
[01:06:52.030 --> 01:06:54.830]  We have a Twitter account, an Instagram account,
[01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:57.410]  and the photos will probably be on the Instagram.
[01:06:58.290 --> 01:06:59.270]  Look at it there.
[01:06:59.270 --> 01:07:01.590]  I don't do this. This isn't my job.
[01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:02.770]  Typically, I'm not the host.
[01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:03.990]  I'm not even a friend.
[01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:05.670]  I'm not even a friend in the bike.
[01:07:06.350 --> 01:07:08.110]  It's illegal for me to be here.
[01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:09.330]  I'm not. This isn't my thing.
[01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:10.750]  I'm going home with it.
[01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:12.930]  Thank you for listening. Nailed it.
[01:07:29.810 --> 01:07:32.730]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:07:33.110 --> 01:07:35.790]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
