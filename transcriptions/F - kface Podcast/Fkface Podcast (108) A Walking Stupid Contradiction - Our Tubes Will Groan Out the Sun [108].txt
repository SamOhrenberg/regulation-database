[00:16.570 --> 00:20.970]  Oh fuck, we've already started? I'm all thrown off.
[00:21.230 --> 00:26.510]  Why is Andrew thrown off? He was trying to do a book club or something and then suddenly stopped in the middle of it.
[00:26.890 --> 00:33.670]  Because nobody showed up. Typically, Eric will show up ten minutes before and Nick showed up like four minutes before.
[00:34.170 --> 00:37.370]  So I feel like I'm still in Pleasantries. I did not expect to be one.
[00:37.630 --> 00:38.490]  You only have four minutes of Pleasantries.
[00:38.690 --> 00:40.810]  We're only four minutes of Pleasantries.
[00:40.810 --> 00:45.410]  That's going to destroy you. I am four minutes off this whole show.
[00:46.030 --> 00:50.610]  Yeah, we'll have to let it roll for another four minutes at the end just so you can finish up.
[00:51.210 --> 00:55.070]  No Eric today, as a matter of fact. He let us know ahead of time.
[00:55.130 --> 00:59.470]  He's got to do dual duty on some other podcast or some shit.
[00:59.650 --> 01:02.290]  It's a bit weird that we still do it at the same time as the other podcast.
[01:03.950 --> 01:06.630]  Yeah, well, I believe that was at your insistence, right?
[01:06.650 --> 01:08.810]  You said you never wanted to do that other podcast again.
[01:08.810 --> 01:12.350]  And you had so you would only do this one if we scheduled it during the exact same time.
[01:12.590 --> 01:13.950]  That's exactly what I said.
[01:14.190 --> 01:16.770]  That is true. I remember that.
[01:17.050 --> 01:18.550]  Hello, hello, hello, hello.
[01:18.670 --> 01:22.070]  And welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:22.370 --> 01:25.690]  I believe, I believe, I don't have Eric here this week.
[01:25.870 --> 01:27.090]  Oh, no, never mind. Nick got it to me.
[01:27.570 --> 01:30.410]  This is episode one hundred and eight.
[01:30.670 --> 01:33.550]  This is season four. Andrew, what year is this?
[01:34.270 --> 01:36.930]  Uh, twenty, twenty two, three.
[01:37.270 --> 01:40.010]  Thank you, Gavin. You nailed it.
[01:40.210 --> 01:43.870]  Volume one, the one hundred and eighth episode.
[01:44.050 --> 01:47.990]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[01:48.710 --> 01:50.810]  And I hope you guys are doing well today.
[01:51.710 --> 01:53.730]  Boy, do I. We got a few things to talk about.
[01:54.010 --> 01:56.610]  I haven't spoken to you guys in a week. I'd love to catch up.
[01:56.850 --> 02:01.550]  And let me tell you, I right out of the way, I just want to get this over with right away.
[02:02.270 --> 02:04.010]  You know, I don't listen to our podcast.
[02:05.270 --> 02:09.390]  I try not to hear me ever, if I can avoid it.
[02:11.210 --> 02:16.450]  I get on my nerves so f***ing quick. It's unbelievable.
[02:17.210 --> 02:20.790]  That's such a wild thing to say as somebody who is on three podcasts currently.
[02:21.590 --> 02:25.610]  As somebody who hates podcasts you're on, you cannot stop making them.
[02:26.030 --> 02:28.650]  So here's the thing. I gotta make a living, right?
[02:28.650 --> 02:30.650]  Daddy's gotta keep the lights on.
[02:31.350 --> 02:39.690]  But also, I think we've established at this point that the three podcasts I'm on are my only forms of social interaction.
[02:39.950 --> 02:42.830]  So it's just how I maintain my relationships with people that are important to me.
[02:43.250 --> 02:47.870]  And imagine if you just like recorded every conversation you had with your mom.
[02:48.110 --> 02:52.210]  And then like a week later, you listen to the conversation you guys had after dinner on a Wednesday night.
[02:52.270 --> 02:53.730]  You'd be like, I sound like a f***ing idiot.
[02:54.010 --> 02:56.510]  Coming next month on RoosterTeeth.com.
[02:56.510 --> 03:02.510]  My mom and I are not doing a podcast together.
[03:03.090 --> 03:05.850]  That is what we call a non-starter.
[03:06.270 --> 03:10.110]  Anyway, so I listened to the podcast the other day.
[03:10.470 --> 03:12.230]  And it was episode 106.
[03:13.010 --> 03:15.650]  And I don't know why. I was just in a really good mood.
[03:15.750 --> 03:17.650]  And I thought, let's ruin that.
[03:18.350 --> 03:19.470]  Let's listen to yourself.
[03:19.630 --> 03:21.590]  And I found it to be so charming.
[03:21.790 --> 03:22.970]  And I enjoyed it so much.
[03:22.970 --> 03:28.890]  There was a little conversation we had about buying homes and then getting a home inspected.
[03:29.270 --> 03:34.330]  And then Andrew had this idea for a vibe inspector to come and check out your home and make sure the vibe fit.
[03:34.630 --> 03:36.470]  Which I thought was so f***ing funny.
[03:36.610 --> 03:38.030]  I laughed about it all day long.
[03:38.130 --> 03:39.130]  It just kept popping up in my head.
[03:39.190 --> 03:40.090]  And I just kept laughing about it.
[03:40.330 --> 03:42.850]  I asked if we could get like a vibe inspector shirt made.
[03:42.990 --> 03:45.650]  Which really sounds kind of creepy actually now that I think about it.
[03:45.870 --> 03:49.110]  It's very close to those like female body inspector shirts.
[03:49.190 --> 03:50.470]  Right, right. You don't like it.
[03:50.570 --> 03:51.790]  You don't want that, right?
[03:51.790 --> 03:54.690]  But I was thinking in terms of like checking out a house.
[03:55.170 --> 03:55.390]  Yeah.
[03:55.630 --> 03:57.390]  As it was framed in our episode.
[03:57.770 --> 04:02.930]  Anyway, so I go through the episode and I'm actually thinking to myself, I should listen to this more often.
[04:03.050 --> 04:04.050]  This isn't that bad.
[04:04.370 --> 04:06.910]  And then I stepped in.
[04:07.410 --> 04:12.210]  And I brought up, then I brought up the idea I had for us.
[04:12.210 --> 04:26.810]  And in one second illustrated why I am the dumbest, stupidest, most idiotic, most useless person on Earth in the year of 2022.
[04:27.390 --> 04:34.070]  I present the idea to you guys that we should, everybody should pick the thing that they think they're the best in the world at, right?
[04:34.610 --> 04:36.370]  Yeah, I have a nice clip for this moment.
[04:36.390 --> 04:37.250]  Yeah, you don't need it.
[04:37.590 --> 04:40.070]  You don't need it because I'm covering it, but it'll help.
[04:40.650 --> 04:46.930]  I then proceed to give you guys the two things that I think I'm the best in the world at as examples.
[04:46.930 --> 04:50.010]  And also tell you there's no way I'm the best in the world at this.
[04:50.170 --> 04:50.790]  This is utter bullshit.
[04:51.350 --> 04:56.790]  And then a week later, and I was coming off the episode, so I remembered it was fresh in my head.
[04:56.950 --> 04:58.850]  107, we then have to present our homework.
[04:59.190 --> 05:00.130]  Clearly, I forgot.
[05:00.430 --> 05:03.010]  Clearly, even after Andrew reminded me, I didn't do it.
[05:03.050 --> 05:03.410]  I forgot.
[05:03.410 --> 05:11.750]  So I just said the first two things that popped into my head, which were my examples that were lies that I admitted were lies to the audience the week before.
[05:12.170 --> 05:13.230]  Completely earnestly.
[05:13.690 --> 05:19.890]  Like suddenly, suddenly I had best in the world confidence where it didn't exist the week before is the only answer I can give you.
[05:20.170 --> 05:21.710]  But holy shit, that's it.
[05:21.730 --> 05:25.950]  I can't ever listen to the podcast again or I'll never be able to open my mouth.
[05:26.150 --> 05:29.730]  I'll never be able to open my mouth because I am a walking, stupid contradiction.
[05:29.730 --> 05:35.370]  We did some of the best, and on my part, unintentional gaslighting I've ever seen.
[05:35.490 --> 05:37.190]  It was so immensely impressive.
[05:37.690 --> 05:42.430]  Basically, what we came up with was that Geoff assigned a piece of homework and I added on to it.
[05:42.550 --> 05:51.230]  And then the next time we talk about it, I'm reading the homework that I helped Geoff assign as if I'm reading it for the first time.
[05:52.130 --> 05:54.570]  And Andrew is the only sane one in the whole thing.
[05:54.670 --> 05:55.410]  I've prepared a clip.
[05:55.590 --> 05:56.510]  Would you like to hear it?
[05:56.510 --> 06:03.190]  Yes, I was infuriated last week because you guys were throwing me under the bus for the thing I had no part in.
[06:03.410 --> 06:05.090]  I was just trying to help you two.
[06:05.830 --> 06:13.970]  This is a little clip from 107, followed by a little dreamy sound effect, and then immediately following the week before.
[06:14.070 --> 06:14.950]  Here we go.
[06:14.990 --> 06:16.770]  We had homework in the last show.
[06:16.970 --> 06:19.450]  Yeah, what was your homework, Andrew?
[06:19.450 --> 06:26.430]  My homework, well, the homework you assigned for all of us was that we had to come up with what we were the best in the world at.
[06:26.670 --> 06:30.550]  And what we thought the other members of this podcast might be the best in the world at.
[06:30.650 --> 06:31.650]  I don't really understand the homework.
[06:32.270 --> 06:39.590]  Podcast homework reminder that we said we would think about what we are best in the world at and what we think others would be best at.
[06:39.930 --> 06:42.010]  But you meant other people on this podcast.
[06:42.350 --> 06:42.950]  I did.
[06:43.130 --> 06:45.710]  I don't even remember assigning the homework, so I don't really give a shit.
[06:45.850 --> 06:46.590]  I hate you both so much.
[06:46.590 --> 06:47.550]  I thought this was Andrew homework.
[06:48.130 --> 06:49.610]  No, this is Geoff homework.
[06:49.710 --> 06:50.850]  It feels like Andrew homework.
[06:50.990 --> 06:55.350]  At the end of the last episode we recorded, you're like, homework for all of us.
[06:55.470 --> 06:57.930]  This is what we'll do and we'll talk about it on the next thing.
[06:58.150 --> 07:01.930]  Yeah, but see, the way you just said that, it sounds like something you would say.
[07:04.030 --> 07:04.790]  You're the worst.
[07:05.110 --> 07:05.830]  You're both the worst.
[07:05.850 --> 07:08.230]  I feel like we should all think about what we're the best in the world at.
[07:08.390 --> 07:10.430]  Maybe that's an angle we should take with the podcast.
[07:10.830 --> 07:15.350]  Should we come up with our own things that we think we're best at or should we come up with us plus the other two?
[07:18.950 --> 07:28.890]  I literally, I can't explain the weird void that happens where as soon as I press stop on this podcast, I can't remember anything we talked about.
[07:29.190 --> 07:33.370]  I'm pretty well versed in f*** face, like I've listened to everyone, I've proofed everyone.
[07:33.870 --> 07:39.750]  I know everything that's happened while I'm recording something and everything except the previous week.
[07:39.830 --> 07:43.710]  There's just this weird void where I have no idea what was said because I haven't proofed it yet.
[07:43.970 --> 07:44.730]  It's so bizarre.
[07:44.730 --> 07:48.730]  I was reading it as though I'd never heard that in my life and I said it.
[07:51.490 --> 07:52.850]  Said the same thing with the pencil.
[07:53.570 --> 07:54.390]  That's me with the pencil.
[07:54.570 --> 07:56.070]  I genuinely forgot I ever said that.
[07:57.810 --> 08:00.790]  Why do we, why do our, do you think it's protection?
[08:00.970 --> 08:07.970]  Do you think our brains are trying to protect us by immediately like flushing the brain toilet the second we hit stop on the episode?
[08:08.590 --> 08:14.670]  If I haven't proofed the previous one at the time of a recording, it doesn't exist to me and I can't explain why.
[08:14.670 --> 08:15.890]  Totally agree.
[08:16.130 --> 08:19.210]  Can I talk about why I'm an idiot in relation to this?
[08:19.610 --> 08:22.630]  So I have a whole other layer of why I'm the dumbest person in the world.
[08:23.690 --> 08:32.270]  Gavin in the face slack yesterday said, hey, one is the preview out for the episode that will come out this upcoming week, which they've heard by now.
[08:32.270 --> 08:36.350]  But you wanted the preview because you said you needed to grab something from it.
[08:37.210 --> 08:40.550]  Historically, it's always been weaponized against me.
[08:40.550 --> 08:48.970]  There's only one other time I could think of when it wasn't aimed at me and it was Geoff's fucking up an ad by spelling the wrong word.
[08:49.050 --> 08:53.430]  And I'm doing the ads, so it can't be you spelling.
[08:54.190 --> 08:56.390]  So I was like, it's just me, I guess.
[08:56.430 --> 08:58.910]  I was like, I was convinced. I texted Gavin last night.
[08:59.270 --> 09:00.670]  So what are you going to use against me?
[09:00.890 --> 09:02.610]  And his silence was deafening.
[09:02.990 --> 09:06.070]  I was convinced that he had something lined up for me.
[09:06.130 --> 09:07.410]  He replied this morning.
[09:07.410 --> 09:08.710]  I'm like, oh, I can play that game too.
[09:08.710 --> 09:09.910]  I ain't going to reply.
[09:10.310 --> 09:17.810]  And I'm going to just say some bullshit in our Slack saying, could you please pull audio from Geoff in this random episode and Gavin in this one?
[09:17.890 --> 09:19.210]  I had no audio pulled.
[09:19.410 --> 09:20.030]  Oh, that was fake?
[09:20.450 --> 09:23.750]  Yeah, that was fake because I was paranoid that you guys had something.
[09:23.950 --> 09:25.470]  So I was trying to flip it.
[09:25.550 --> 09:28.090]  I was trying to make you paranoid about what I might had.
[09:28.250 --> 09:31.570]  But it's the first time your fucking audio is on my side.
[09:32.010 --> 09:33.230]  It was for me.
[09:33.470 --> 09:34.290]  Yeah, guys.
[09:34.530 --> 09:37.170]  I would happily use audio against you.
[09:37.170 --> 09:40.690]  But I was listening to that last week and I just thought I have to bury myself.
[09:40.830 --> 09:43.330]  I have to use this audio against me and Geoff because it is horrid.
[09:43.910 --> 09:52.250]  I appreciate it because it was I felt like a crazy person last week when you guys were like, ah, this is some bullshit homework by you throwing it all on me.
[09:52.330 --> 09:54.330]  I didn't I didn't care if we did it.
[09:54.370 --> 09:56.010]  It was just trying to be supportive.
[09:56.010 --> 10:01.810]  The funny thing there is I was totally just fucking with you.
[10:02.370 --> 10:03.190]  Like I do.
[10:03.350 --> 10:05.630]  I remember assigning the homework and all that at that point.
[10:05.770 --> 10:08.110]  I just assumed Gavin was along for the gag.
[10:08.130 --> 10:09.810]  I just thought we were both in on the joke.
[10:10.230 --> 10:12.890]  I'm just extremely unintelligent.
[10:13.750 --> 10:16.010]  So Gavin, you're an idiot that way.
[10:16.410 --> 10:21.350]  I'm a I have zero integrity and I'm just a bald faced liar.
[10:21.350 --> 10:22.970]  And then Andrew, you're back to parody.
[10:23.310 --> 10:27.410]  You're in a new Paranoia era, which is scary because I do not.
[10:27.530 --> 10:28.330]  I'll be honest, guys.
[10:28.390 --> 10:32.110]  I do not want to go back into a new age of Paranoia.
[10:32.310 --> 10:34.230]  It was too much.
[10:34.970 --> 10:37.710]  Oh, but that sounds like such a great subtitle for a season.
[10:38.050 --> 10:39.350]  The new age of Paranoia.
[10:39.590 --> 10:40.650]  Season 5.
[10:41.010 --> 10:43.130]  I was really excited.
[10:43.550 --> 10:45.570]  Andrew in the Slack wrote, this is super short notice.
[10:45.650 --> 10:47.990]  So if it's possible, though, if it's not possible, no worries.
[10:47.990 --> 10:50.930]  But could someone pull something Gavin said in episode 98?
[10:51.470 --> 10:53.890]  I also need something Geoff said in 101.
[10:54.190 --> 10:56.010]  I like that you're just so vague.
[10:56.150 --> 10:57.990]  There's no time codes and I'm just like...
[10:58.630 --> 11:02.030]  And now I'm slightly disappointed that you got no audio weapon.
[11:02.410 --> 11:06.990]  My hope was that maybe one of you would listen to it and try to find the thing.
[11:07.370 --> 11:10.610]  Like that was my long shot would be funny, but I was just trying to create Paranoia.
[11:10.670 --> 11:14.410]  Because I was convinced what you had would be used against me in some capacity.
[11:15.430 --> 11:16.450]  What a waste.
[11:16.450 --> 11:18.090]  I'm sorry, Nick.
[11:18.430 --> 11:20.730]  I immediately reached out to Nick and was like, nah, I don't need anything.
[11:20.890 --> 11:21.650]  I'm just being dumb.
[11:22.210 --> 11:22.910]  Mind games.
[11:23.490 --> 11:28.610]  I love that we have one bit that was honestly not even a good bit.
[11:29.010 --> 11:34.850]  A fucking five minute bit that turned into three separate instances of us being idiots.
[11:38.530 --> 11:41.410]  Well, you never know where the good bits will be.
[11:41.510 --> 11:42.870]  Because I'm going to be honest with you.
[11:42.870 --> 11:47.150]  When you said, let's all make salads.
[11:47.510 --> 11:51.070]  Internally, I was like, I don't know why we're doing this, but I'll do it because you want to.
[11:51.210 --> 11:51.930]  I support this.
[11:52.510 --> 11:54.890]  Salad cream. I fucked that up in a whole...
[11:55.510 --> 11:57.030]  Or was that unrelated to the salad?
[11:57.310 --> 11:58.990]  Was that a side...
[11:58.990 --> 12:00.830]  How much salad content have we made?
[12:01.010 --> 12:01.790]  Was that adjacent?
[12:02.270 --> 12:05.170]  Was that salad cream content that became salad content?
[12:05.350 --> 12:07.350]  Or was that part of the make your salad content?
[12:07.630 --> 12:09.990]  You're going way too far back in the vault for me.
[12:10.490 --> 12:10.970]  That's fair.
[12:10.970 --> 12:13.310]  Gavin, you pretend to remember stuff.
[12:13.570 --> 12:14.450]  What do you think?
[12:16.370 --> 12:17.410]  Nick says it was separate.
[12:18.290 --> 12:19.130]  What was that?
[12:19.370 --> 12:20.150]  Gavin, are you okay?
[12:20.590 --> 12:22.890]  It was like a seven second silence.
[12:23.110 --> 12:24.410]  Like you're waiting for Nick's approval.
[12:28.010 --> 12:29.490]  That was very weird.
[12:30.230 --> 12:31.190]  Please keep that in, Nick.
[12:31.250 --> 12:33.370]  That was a very strange long silence.
[12:34.770 --> 12:36.610]  I thought you had a connection issue.
[12:37.770 --> 12:38.930]  It was pretty long, wasn't it?
[12:38.930 --> 12:40.270]  Even Nick admits it was long.
[12:40.350 --> 12:41.070]  Nick was scared.
[12:48.090 --> 12:50.570]  God, speaking of scared...
[12:50.570 --> 12:56.330]  Gavin, should you and I talk about how the universe is scared that you and I will ever spend any time together?
[12:56.530 --> 12:58.610]  They're back at it. It's not the weather this time, though.
[12:59.090 --> 12:59.390]  God.
[13:00.430 --> 13:00.910]  Damn it.
[13:01.190 --> 13:04.670]  I don't know if we talked about it on the podcast yet.
[13:05.530 --> 13:07.470]  Or in personal conversations, Andrew.
[13:07.470 --> 13:12.730]  But Gavin and I, and our significant others, his girlfriend Meg and my girlfriend Emily,
[13:13.110 --> 13:17.550]  we had all decided, we'd been talking for months and months and months about going to Las Vegas together
[13:17.550 --> 13:19.390]  and having a weekend in Vegas together.
[13:19.650 --> 13:22.030]  And we finally fucking scheduled it.
[13:22.670 --> 13:25.990]  And it was for this weekend, right?
[13:28.630 --> 13:32.610]  The way I had it set up is, because it's the NBA Finals,
[13:33.090 --> 13:35.070]  Emily and I were going to get up first thing Friday morning,
[13:35.070 --> 13:36.950]  and we were going to fly to Boston.
[13:37.350 --> 13:40.610]  And then Friday night, we were going to watch Game 4 of the Finals
[13:40.610 --> 13:42.250]  as my birthday present from Emily.
[13:43.210 --> 13:45.410]  She was going to get us awesome seats.
[13:46.010 --> 13:48.090]  And I would get to watch the Celtics play in the Finals,
[13:48.110 --> 13:50.230]  which is like a dream come true for me.
[13:50.290 --> 13:52.070]  And I've only got to do it once before in my life.
[13:52.390 --> 13:53.570]  And that was with Jack.
[13:53.790 --> 13:55.890]  So talk about an update, getting to see it with Emily.
[13:57.150 --> 14:00.430]  And then we were going to go to bed and then get up first thing Saturday morning
[14:00.430 --> 14:03.610]  and fly to Las Vegas and meet Gavin and Meg in Las Vegas.
[14:03.610 --> 14:06.570]  I was so excited for this. We were going to spend two days together.
[14:06.890 --> 14:09.210]  We got hotel rooms in the same place.
[14:09.490 --> 14:11.790]  We were going to do, like, I thought they came up with this clever idea
[14:11.790 --> 14:14.230]  where we were going to do one thing they really want to do, one thing we want to do.
[14:14.510 --> 14:18.810]  So Emily got tickets to see Shin Lim and go to a magic show so I could heckle,
[14:19.170 --> 14:22.010]  which is what I want to do, and she likes magic.
[14:22.170 --> 14:25.490]  And then Gavin and Meg wanted to go do some escape rooms,
[14:25.610 --> 14:26.830]  so we were going to go do that.
[14:26.910 --> 14:29.210]  And it was just like, it was shaping up to be the perfect weekend.
[14:29.850 --> 14:34.210]  And last night, last night, Emily tested positive for COVID.
[14:34.890 --> 14:37.430]  No! I couldn't believe it.
[14:37.530 --> 14:37.650]  No!
[14:38.010 --> 14:40.710]  Because the universe was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[14:40.810 --> 14:42.670]  Who's going to have fun with who? No!
[14:43.430 --> 14:46.170]  No, fuck you! Fuck you!
[14:46.470 --> 14:47.370]  Is what the universe said.
[14:48.010 --> 14:51.050]  I was literally like, wow, I'm actually looking forward to a trip
[14:51.050 --> 14:54.970]  for the first time that, you know, there isn't a work trip or me going to see my family.
[14:55.090 --> 14:58.150]  It's like, this is a real vacation trip.
[14:58.150 --> 14:59.510]  Oh, never mind.
[14:59.870 --> 15:03.990]  Yeah, it's a I and I know Emily is heartbroken, obviously,
[15:03.990 --> 15:06.670]  and I feel terrible for her and she feels so guilty for getting COVID,
[15:06.790 --> 15:08.170]  which is, you know, totally not her fault,
[15:08.170 --> 15:10.410]  because everybody seems to get it at some point or other.
[15:10.730 --> 15:15.050]  But it's it's kind of luckily I was I was telling Emily,
[15:15.150 --> 15:18.370]  I've the universe has been aware of me for long enough
[15:18.370 --> 15:20.550]  that stuff getting canceled no longer affects me.
[15:20.610 --> 15:21.850]  It's like, OK, whatever. I get it.
[15:21.890 --> 15:24.630]  Just, you know, just me stepping in shit in the backyard again.
[15:24.750 --> 15:26.570]  No problem. It's just the new version of that, right?
[15:26.570 --> 15:28.530]  I'm I'm supposed to be in the shit.
[15:29.730 --> 15:33.850]  Of course. Right. And so it's no big deal to me.
[15:33.910 --> 15:35.250]  I'm just like, I will get them next time, champ.
[15:36.030 --> 15:37.910]  But she was pretty heartbroken about it.
[15:38.050 --> 15:40.590]  And I hope that we can do it again in the future.
[15:40.750 --> 15:44.570]  But maybe we can't, like, plan the universe out or something.
[15:44.930 --> 15:47.850]  Like we can't let on to the universe that we're trying to spend time together.
[15:48.650 --> 15:50.070]  Not to go too far back.
[15:50.170 --> 15:53.570]  But how you frame that just gave me a thought that I've never had before.
[15:53.570 --> 15:56.570]  You said you wanted to see a magic show.
[15:56.670 --> 15:57.510]  What was the other thing?
[15:58.730 --> 15:59.610]  Escape rooms.
[15:59.630 --> 16:01.030]  No, that was Gavin's thing.
[16:01.310 --> 16:02.390]  I thought you said two things.
[16:02.650 --> 16:05.530]  I want to heckle the magician.
[16:06.210 --> 16:08.550]  Oh, I see. So your thing was magicians.
[16:09.030 --> 16:11.590]  And the thing that Gavin and Meg were excited about
[16:11.590 --> 16:14.850]  was traveling to a place to get locked into a room
[16:14.850 --> 16:16.810]  that you have to try to leave from.
[16:17.210 --> 16:17.710]  With your wits.
[16:17.710 --> 16:18.810]  Like the premise of an escape.
[16:18.970 --> 16:20.850]  Like, I know, they're fun. They're great.
[16:20.850 --> 16:23.710]  But the idea of having the first escape room
[16:23.710 --> 16:26.030]  and trying to convince somebody that's fun
[16:26.030 --> 16:27.790]  feels like a real exercise.
[16:28.190 --> 16:30.290]  Because the premise is you go to a place
[16:30.290 --> 16:32.230]  I'm going to lock you in this room
[16:32.230 --> 16:34.530]  and you're not going to be able to immediately leave.
[16:34.650 --> 16:37.450]  You're going to have to try to solve clues to leave this space.
[16:37.530 --> 16:38.030]  Have fun.
[16:38.570 --> 16:40.070]  You're going to pay me for this.
[16:40.330 --> 16:42.470]  Considering, at least in my mind,
[16:42.610 --> 16:45.930]  the genesis of this whole escape room craze
[16:45.930 --> 16:47.710]  was from that movie The Cube
[16:47.710 --> 16:50.010]  where people just woke up in a cube
[16:50.010 --> 16:51.310]  and then they had to get out
[16:51.310 --> 16:52.690]  and every time they tried, they died.
[16:53.010 --> 16:54.970]  Like, it's such a dark beginning.
[16:56.130 --> 16:57.590]  I was looking forward to it, though.
[16:57.670 --> 16:59.230]  I like escape rooms. I think they're a blast.
[16:59.570 --> 17:00.350]  Oh, they're great.
[17:00.770 --> 17:02.570]  Meg was really looking forward to The Magician.
[17:03.070 --> 17:05.390]  And I had to... because magic, she loves it.
[17:05.410 --> 17:07.190]  It makes her cry for some reason. She explained it.
[17:07.470 --> 17:08.830]  But I had to warn her about
[17:09.230 --> 17:11.630]  the fact that the experience of seeing a magician with Geoff
[17:11.630 --> 17:13.170]  is going to be a completely different experience.
[17:15.470 --> 17:16.190]  Where there's...
[17:17.090 --> 17:17.450]  HOW?!
[17:18.990 --> 17:20.830]  I just can't do it, man.
[17:28.110 --> 17:29.710]  Listen, I've performed on stage.
[17:30.050 --> 17:31.550]  Performers feed off of energy.
[17:31.790 --> 17:33.030]  You want to give good energy.
[17:33.370 --> 17:34.850]  You want them to know you're entertained
[17:34.850 --> 17:36.470]  and amazed by what they're doing.
[17:37.590 --> 17:40.970]  I know you share a deep fandom for Norm Macdonald, Geoff.
[17:41.010 --> 17:42.810]  Have you ever seen the compilation of him
[17:42.810 --> 17:45.130]  when he was hosting the YouTube Comedy Festival?
[17:45.870 --> 17:47.730]  With, like, Sarah Silverman was there.
[17:47.730 --> 17:49.510]  I don't remember whose co-hosts were.
[17:49.770 --> 17:51.790]  But they had a magician come on
[17:51.790 --> 17:53.410]  as, like, one of the acts.
[17:53.490 --> 17:55.490]  That guy is a Netflix show. I don't remember his name now.
[17:55.910 --> 17:57.510]  But he did this trick where, like,
[17:57.530 --> 17:59.450]  he put this giant...
[17:59.450 --> 18:02.470]  this giant glass into a box.
[18:02.550 --> 18:04.690]  And it exploded, was, like, the trick.
[18:05.270 --> 18:06.610]  And it cut one of the hosts.
[18:06.650 --> 18:07.330]  It was a disaster.
[18:07.610 --> 18:08.810]  And it explodes.
[18:09.050 --> 18:11.250]  And Norm Macdonald's response was to say,
[18:11.310 --> 18:13.090]  This guy's a fucking sorcerer.
[18:13.150 --> 18:14.850]  Like, he got so nervous about it.
[18:14.850 --> 18:17.490]  It was great.
[18:17.750 --> 18:19.570]  It sounds like what your experience is.
[18:19.650 --> 18:20.410]  It's so fucking funny.
[18:20.490 --> 18:23.390]  You got cut. That's what happens
[18:23.390 --> 18:25.390]  when you put a fucking sorcerer on set.
[18:25.730 --> 18:26.570]  What do we expect?
[18:26.930 --> 18:28.450]  We have a wizard here.
[18:29.050 --> 18:30.130]  It's great. I'll send it to you.
[18:30.370 --> 18:32.210]  I'll say I am halfway through with his
[18:33.650 --> 18:34.450]  posthumous special
[18:34.450 --> 18:35.710]  that's on Netflix right now.
[18:36.010 --> 18:38.230]  And I had to turn it off because it was making me cry.
[18:38.750 --> 18:39.290]  Was it sad?
[18:39.830 --> 18:40.070]  Yeah.
[18:40.590 --> 18:42.710]  It's just, like, it's just him
[18:42.710 --> 18:44.850]  like the night before, I think, a surgery.
[18:45.150 --> 18:47.450]  And he was like, I gotta get all this out
[18:47.450 --> 18:48.790]  just in case, you know.
[18:48.970 --> 18:51.170]  And then he looks very ill.
[18:51.550 --> 18:53.130]  And he's very sweet
[18:53.130 --> 18:55.230]  and very funny. And he's just going off
[18:55.230 --> 18:56.690]  the top of his head and there's no audience
[18:56.690 --> 18:58.850]  or no crowd. So it's a bit awkward
[18:58.850 --> 19:00.930]  at times. But more than anything, you just like
[19:00.930 --> 19:02.430]  you just see in this
[19:03.050 --> 19:04.830]  what appears to someone who didn't
[19:04.830 --> 19:06.750]  know him as a gentle brilliance
[19:06.750 --> 19:08.810]  and in just such a fragile state.
[19:09.070 --> 19:11.330]  It was really, really kind of heartbreaking.
[19:11.330 --> 19:12.770]  And it didn't kill him then, did it?
[19:12.870 --> 19:14.190]  He died much later than that.
[19:14.370 --> 19:16.450]  Yeah, he died about a year after that, yeah.
[19:16.650 --> 19:17.270]  Yeah, wow.
[19:17.530 --> 19:20.370]  I got to see him at the theater in town.
[19:21.090 --> 19:23.390]  And it's one of my favorite shows
[19:23.390 --> 19:25.170]  I've ever seen. And I would constantly
[19:25.170 --> 19:26.950]  ever since that point, I probably saw that
[19:26.950 --> 19:29.030]  in like 2014, I would
[19:29.030 --> 19:30.950]  constantly look at their schedule
[19:30.950 --> 19:33.370]  and be like, oh, is he gonna come into town?
[19:33.610 --> 19:34.970]  That would be so exciting, I love
[19:34.970 --> 19:36.270]  he's one of my favorite comedians.
[19:36.730 --> 19:38.470]  And I recently, like a week ago,
[19:39.050 --> 19:40.450]  went on the website just to see
[19:40.450 --> 19:42.230]  what it is. It's always all cover bands.
[19:42.350 --> 19:44.090]  It's terrible. The booking is awful.
[19:44.190 --> 19:45.230]  It's just cover bands.
[19:45.510 --> 19:48.370]  I had this weird realization, even though he's been dead
[19:48.370 --> 19:50.450]  for quite a while, there was still part of me
[19:50.450 --> 19:51.910]  that was like, oh, maybe I'll see him
[19:52.390 --> 19:54.130]  like that'll never happen again.
[19:54.230 --> 19:56.510]  It was a weird processing of like
[19:56.510 --> 19:56.970]  he's gone.
[19:57.610 --> 20:00.430]  Yeah, you were lucky enough to see him as such a small window
[20:00.430 --> 20:02.170]  of overlap in your lives.
[20:02.650 --> 20:04.670]  Exactly. And it's just a strange
[20:04.670 --> 20:06.350]  thing. I don't know if I'll watch that. I have like a weird
[20:06.350 --> 20:07.450]  thing where if there's
[20:08.110 --> 20:10.330]  an artist or like a creative type that I
[20:10.330 --> 20:11.850]  like, I really struggle
[20:11.850 --> 20:14.210]  with finishing their last work.
[20:14.470 --> 20:16.330]  Oh, yeah. Like the idea of knowing that I
[20:16.330 --> 20:18.290]  have that like whenever I want to is
[20:18.290 --> 20:20.370]  almost more impactful to me than if
[20:20.370 --> 20:22.370]  I saw it. I had the
[20:22.370 --> 20:24.270]  same with Patrice O'Neill, where I've like never seen
[20:24.270 --> 20:26.310]  his special, but I just thought his earlier work was so
[20:26.310 --> 20:27.870]  funny, conversationally at least.
[20:28.050 --> 20:30.370]  I completely agree with you. There are two series that I
[20:30.370 --> 20:32.090]  that like touched me
[20:32.090 --> 20:34.230]  so intensely in some
[20:34.230 --> 20:36.250]  way that I never finished them on
[20:36.250 --> 20:38.050]  purpose. And that, I mean they're very
[20:38.050 --> 20:40.230]  silly, but Schitt's Creek, I am
[20:40.230 --> 20:42.250]  halfway through the last season of Schitt's Creek and I just don't
[20:42.250 --> 20:43.890]  want to finish it because I don't want it to be over.
[20:44.590 --> 20:46.350]  And season three of
[20:46.350 --> 20:48.330]  Ash vs. Evil Dead, because I have
[20:48.330 --> 20:50.290]  been a fan of Evil Dead since I was a kid
[20:50.670 --> 20:52.350]  and I grew up with it and it's
[20:52.350 --> 20:54.390]  so charming and so well done
[20:54.390 --> 20:56.170]  that I just don't want to see it be
[20:56.170 --> 20:58.270]  over, you know? And so I just, I don't know
[20:58.270 --> 21:00.150]  that I'll ever watch them because I just like
[21:00.150 --> 21:02.190]  knowing that they're out there if I ever want to.
[21:02.190 --> 21:04.150]  You know? I'd rather have
[21:04.150 --> 21:06.270]  that than know what
[21:06.270 --> 21:08.210]  I'm missing in some ways. Totally.
[21:08.690 --> 21:10.030]  Yeah, absolutely. I can
[21:10.030 --> 21:12.330]  relate to that. Even in like
[21:12.330 --> 21:13.870]  silly, I think like the funniest one
[21:13.870 --> 21:15.670]  is I have a clip of
[21:16.210 --> 21:17.950]  oh, I forget his last name, but
[21:17.950 --> 21:19.730]  the Celtics play-by-play guy, Mike
[21:19.730 --> 21:21.870]  what's his last name, Geoff? Mike Gorman?
[21:22.330 --> 21:24.350]  Mike Gorman, yeah. I've got like
[21:24.350 --> 21:26.270]  he did like an immemorial thing
[21:26.270 --> 21:28.150]  to Tommy Heinzen that I just have never
[21:28.150 --> 21:29.850]  watched because I like having that.
[21:29.850 --> 21:31.110]  Because they were such a
[21:32.090 --> 21:33.690]  an important, iconic
[21:33.690 --> 21:35.870]  duo, even though I didn't get to
[21:35.870 --> 21:37.910]  see too much of their coverage. Like they called games
[21:37.910 --> 21:39.650]  for, I'd assume, over 20 years.
[21:39.850 --> 21:41.870]  Felt like they did it for like 70 years.
[21:42.150 --> 21:43.910]  It felt like they were pillars of
[21:43.910 --> 21:45.010]  eternity for that team.
[21:46.710 --> 21:48.010]  Yeah, it's interesting
[21:48.010 --> 21:49.750]  how those pieces of media
[21:49.750 --> 21:51.770]  can impact you. Gavin,
[21:51.930 --> 21:53.870]  do you share any
[21:53.870 --> 21:55.090]  experiences like that?
[21:55.930 --> 21:58.090]  Where I don't want to watch someone's
[21:58.090 --> 21:59.810]  end, their final piece of their work.
[22:00.250 --> 22:01.230]  Sure, you don't want it to be over.
[22:01.950 --> 22:03.850]  I've never really looked at it from that point of view.
[22:03.910 --> 22:06.130]  I feel like it's quite interesting. Like I would watch
[22:06.130 --> 22:08.110]  the Norm thing, but yeah, it is
[22:08.110 --> 22:09.610]  sad. But I feel like comedy and
[22:10.490 --> 22:12.230]  tragedy, they go so well together, don't they?
[22:12.690 --> 22:13.750]  Totally. For sure.
[22:14.430 --> 22:16.030]  Absolutely. It was interesting when
[22:16.030 --> 22:18.010]  Norm passed, like thinking about how much
[22:18.010 --> 22:19.830]  his comedy I think has impacted
[22:19.830 --> 22:21.890]  f***face, like indirectly. I think just
[22:21.890 --> 22:24.110]  through what at least I find funny.
[22:24.750 --> 22:25.950]  Yeah. Oh yeah.
[22:26.530 --> 22:27.710]  I went on an absolute
[22:27.710 --> 22:29.950]  YouTube binge after he died of just all of his
[22:29.950 --> 22:31.830]  late night appearances and
[22:31.830 --> 22:34.210]  SNL stuff and he just never gave
[22:34.210 --> 22:36.070]  a singular s*** at any
[22:36.070 --> 22:38.450]  point. And it's so, you gotta respect it.
[22:39.630 --> 22:41.730]  I don't think anyone has done it to that extent
[22:41.730 --> 22:43.890]  throughout and kept an entire career going.
[22:44.270 --> 22:45.890]  One other person who's also
[22:45.890 --> 22:47.650]  dead now, unfortunately, and that was Gilbert Godfrey.
[22:47.890 --> 22:50.030]  They both...
[22:50.030 --> 22:51.130]  Just like...
[22:51.130 --> 22:53.790]  They really are like the
[22:53.790 --> 22:55.610]  prototype for
[22:55.610 --> 22:57.630]  what f***face is, right? It's like
[22:57.630 --> 23:00.070]  just two people that are
[23:00.550 --> 23:01.770]  so entertained by
[23:01.770 --> 23:03.730]  the thing that they're doing that it
[23:03.730 --> 23:05.690]  doesn't matter if it's detrimental to them
[23:05.690 --> 23:07.850]  or their career in any way. They're gonna
[23:07.850 --> 23:09.790]  go up there and do it. Gilbert Godfrey is gonna
[23:09.790 --> 23:11.890]  go up there when he's on tour
[23:11.890 --> 23:13.930]  with the Go-Go's and they come
[23:13.930 --> 23:15.610]  to him and the producers come to him and say,
[23:15.670 --> 23:17.830]  listen, this is a family-friendly show. These are
[23:17.830 --> 23:19.750]  a bunch of 12-year-old
[23:19.750 --> 23:21.990]  girls that want to see the Go-Go's
[23:21.990 --> 23:24.090]  on vacation and
[23:24.090 --> 23:25.550]  you can't get up there and
[23:25.550 --> 23:27.830]  talk about anal. And he's like, okay, got it.
[23:27.870 --> 23:29.570]  And it goes worse, you know?
[23:29.830 --> 23:31.270]  Because he doesn't have a choice.
[23:32.830 --> 23:33.570]  It's like...
[23:33.570 --> 23:35.990]  He doesn't want to. That is now the funniest
[23:35.990 --> 23:38.470]  choice. You have to do...
[23:38.470 --> 23:39.610]  Yeah, it's like there's
[23:39.610 --> 23:42.050]  some sort of invisible
[23:42.050 --> 23:43.350]  force pulling you towards
[23:43.990 --> 23:45.030]  a self-destructive joke.
[23:46.330 --> 23:47.890]  It's great to even just like
[23:47.890 --> 23:49.730]  with Norm, especially for me,
[23:49.730 --> 23:51.530]  you constantly hear new stories
[23:51.530 --> 23:53.930]  and it's like the content, even though he's not producing new stuff,
[23:54.010 --> 23:55.730]  you learn different aspects. I was listening
[23:55.730 --> 23:57.910]  to a thing recently and this person
[23:57.910 --> 24:00.030]  talked about how when Norm was starting
[24:00.030 --> 24:01.710]  in Canada as a comedian,
[24:02.150 --> 24:03.770]  he would bomb all the time because
[24:03.770 --> 24:05.810]  his style was very specific
[24:05.810 --> 24:07.890]  and it didn't work in a lot of rooms.
[24:08.450 --> 24:09.490]  And if he bombed,
[24:09.950 --> 24:11.770]  he would stay... if he did
[24:11.770 --> 24:13.550]  well, he would kind of just leave immediately,
[24:13.550 --> 24:15.730]  but if he bombed, he'd stay in the green room the
[24:15.730 --> 24:17.650]  entire night. And then he'd go
[24:17.650 --> 24:19.450]  to the exit when everybody finished
[24:19.450 --> 24:21.990]  and he'd make everybody shake his hand on the way out.
[24:22.930 --> 24:23.410]  LAUGHTER
[24:24.570 --> 24:25.050]  LAUGHTER
[24:26.890 --> 24:27.370]  LAUGHTER
[24:28.330 --> 24:29.790]  He didn't give a fuck
[24:29.790 --> 24:31.390]  if he did well, but if he did horribly
[24:31.390 --> 24:33.790]  just for the awkward exchange, he would shake
[24:33.790 --> 24:34.970]  everybody's hand.
[24:35.870 --> 24:36.770]  So good.
[24:37.990 --> 24:38.450]  He's a legend.
[24:39.590 --> 24:40.070]  LAUGHTER
[24:41.170 --> 24:43.830]  I had to register a new phone number
[24:43.830 --> 24:45.350]  recently. Yeah?
[24:45.350 --> 24:46.930]  And I had a...
[24:46.930 --> 24:49.090]  It was the first time I've ever been able to
[24:49.090 --> 24:51.490]  pick a phone number. You just type in numbers
[24:51.490 --> 24:53.110]  and see if it's available. Holy shit!
[24:53.250 --> 24:55.350]  And then I was like...
[24:55.950 --> 24:57.310]  Oh, I bet there's websites
[24:57.310 --> 24:59.430]  for this. And I found a website that just sells numbers.
[24:59.530 --> 25:01.630]  I assume they just buy up all these
[25:01.630 --> 25:03.190]  vanity phone numbers and stuff.
[25:03.490 --> 25:05.370]  And I found one with
[25:05.370 --> 25:07.150]  a 778 area code,
[25:07.250 --> 25:09.370]  which I think is BC in Canada.
[25:09.810 --> 25:10.690]  I think it's one of those ones.
[25:11.150 --> 25:13.370]  And I found... Andrew, I found your
[25:13.830 --> 25:14.810]  ultimate phone number.
[25:15.010 --> 25:16.410]  You did? What's the number?
[25:16.990 --> 25:18.590]  I'll let me move my fucking...
[25:20.050 --> 25:20.850]  778 pancake?
[25:21.810 --> 25:23.050]  And it's $2,000.
[25:24.030 --> 25:25.050]  That's too much.
[25:25.230 --> 25:27.850]  I think we should get the Eric's credit card.
[25:28.270 --> 25:29.410]  No, we need...
[25:29.410 --> 25:29.510]  LAUGHTER
[25:30.790 --> 25:32.510]  And I think that should be your phone number.
[25:33.050 --> 25:33.850]  When will this air?
[25:34.750 --> 25:36.690]  Nick, what day will this come out?
[25:37.490 --> 25:38.730]  Can we talk about this thing?
[25:38.810 --> 25:41.710]  The thing that we bleep two weeks from now is that...
[25:41.710 --> 25:42.890]  Yeah, it's fine.
[25:44.290 --> 25:45.950]  I found out recently that...
[25:48.790 --> 25:50.070]  That is essentially
[25:50.070 --> 25:51.410]  what it's predicted to go at.
[25:51.690 --> 25:53.790]  I'd much rather...
[25:53.790 --> 25:55.290]  than 778 pancake.
[25:55.530 --> 25:57.230]  As good as 778 pancake is.
[25:57.430 --> 25:58.610]  That's fucking great.
[25:59.570 --> 26:01.810]  So are you in the process of changing
[26:01.810 --> 26:03.550]  your phone number and then not telling us?
[26:03.730 --> 26:04.830]  No, it's like a business line.
[26:05.090 --> 26:07.890]  Oh, 778 pancake
[26:07.890 --> 26:08.710]  would be so good.
[26:08.710 --> 26:09.090]  LAUGHTER
[26:09.990 --> 26:12.430]  If you're interested in high-speed photography,
[26:12.730 --> 26:14.170]  call the Slow Mo Guys.
[26:14.270 --> 26:15.550]  It's 778 pancake.
[26:17.530 --> 26:18.410]  I watched...
[26:18.410 --> 26:20.690]  Maybe you'll remember the name to this, Geoff.
[26:20.770 --> 26:22.350]  Because it was like a big 90's movie.
[26:22.450 --> 26:24.250]  Sandra Bullock. It's where she's like a hacker.
[26:24.750 --> 26:25.470]  She's a computer hacker.
[26:25.790 --> 26:28.330]  I watched The Net like a week ago.
[26:28.750 --> 26:30.950]  And she goes on a website called pizza.net
[26:30.950 --> 26:32.650]  and I've never wanted anything more to exist.
[26:32.810 --> 26:34.870]  I was so disappointed to put in pizza.net
[26:34.870 --> 26:36.250]  and have it not exist.
[26:36.250 --> 26:37.210]  How much is it?
[26:37.530 --> 26:39.290]  I have no idea. I don't even think it's for sale.
[26:39.410 --> 26:40.910]  It's just like this domain doesn't exist.
[26:41.070 --> 26:43.970]  She orders a pizza from pizza.net and it just comes to her house.
[26:44.030 --> 26:44.450]  It's great.
[26:44.830 --> 26:47.130]  That's the one with like Mozart's Ghost.
[26:47.350 --> 26:48.130]  Or whatever, right?
[26:48.330 --> 26:50.150]  Yeah, it is! It's Mozart's Ghost.
[26:51.870 --> 26:53.910]  She's a hacker and she...
[26:53.910 --> 26:55.330]  I don't know. It's a dumb movie.
[26:55.550 --> 26:57.930]  It's 90's internet cringe in the best way.
[26:58.110 --> 26:59.950]  So we agree
[26:59.950 --> 27:01.750]  we're gonna get the s***, right?
[27:01.850 --> 27:04.050]  We have to and that's why I'm so mad
[27:04.050 --> 27:05.950]  that Eric is here because I independently
[27:06.410 --> 27:08.310]  made an account on that website
[27:08.310 --> 27:10.230]  and I just got an email from them
[27:10.230 --> 27:12.690]  saying like, yeah, you need to send in a proof of address
[27:13.330 --> 27:14.190]  with an ID.
[27:14.530 --> 27:15.850]  Like you need to properly register
[27:15.850 --> 27:18.590]  and it took like six days for that process to go through.
[27:18.630 --> 27:19.450]  We're gonna have to go through you.
[27:19.610 --> 27:21.670]  We need to get on that.
[27:22.810 --> 27:23.530]  It's actually...
[27:24.430 --> 27:26.190]  Like Andrew and I have had an idea
[27:26.190 --> 27:28.090]  about a thing we want to do someday
[27:28.090 --> 27:30.010]  and it's pretty important to that idea
[27:30.010 --> 27:31.630]  so I feel like we need this...
[27:31.630 --> 27:34.190]  S*** is integral
[27:34.670 --> 27:36.450]  to the future of f***face.
[27:36.750 --> 27:37.450]  We need to get this thing.
[27:37.850 --> 27:39.830]  Yeah, I mean I would love for us
[27:39.830 --> 27:41.650]  to record s*** on like
[27:41.650 --> 27:43.010]  8am that day, Pacific.
[27:43.410 --> 27:45.370]  10 for you guys. I think it would be so much fun.
[27:45.790 --> 27:47.290]  Are we talking a s***?
[27:48.770 --> 27:49.510]  I don't...
[27:49.510 --> 27:50.530]  They say it's s***.
[27:50.750 --> 27:53.370]  Let me pull up the link. I think it's just the way it's phrased
[27:53.370 --> 27:54.910]  is like this is the only one.
[27:55.150 --> 27:56.470]  Will it fit any of us, do you think?
[27:56.650 --> 27:57.790]  I don't... probably.
[27:57.790 --> 27:59.850]  I think it could fit you.
[28:00.030 --> 28:00.870]  I could see it on you.
[28:01.410 --> 28:03.510]  It says this c*** consists of a b***
[28:03.510 --> 28:05.510]  and an actate a*****
[28:05.510 --> 28:07.670]  and matching c*** with metal
[28:07.670 --> 28:08.110]  c***
[28:09.810 --> 28:11.870]  exhibits wear including a pair of harness
[28:11.870 --> 28:13.230]  holes on the side by the c***.
[28:13.270 --> 28:16.210]  Can you say that word, that second word you said again?
[28:16.530 --> 28:17.690]  Did you say actate?
[28:17.690 --> 28:18.630]  Can you say actate?
[28:19.010 --> 28:21.190]  I have no idea what that word is. I have no clue.
[28:22.010 --> 28:23.370]  A-C-E-T-A-T-E
[28:23.370 --> 28:25.790]  I had never heard the word actate
[28:25.790 --> 28:27.470]  before and I assumed...
[28:27.470 --> 28:29.210]  Can I talk?
[28:29.910 --> 28:31.590]  Can I call some... Gavin knows about this.
[28:31.690 --> 28:33.970]  I have a friend, speaking of pronouncing words
[28:33.970 --> 28:35.830]  incorrectly, my friend Jake
[28:35.830 --> 28:37.870]  one of my favorite bits recently is I learned
[28:37.870 --> 28:40.010]  that Jake thinks he pronounces
[28:40.010 --> 28:41.530]  the word toms, tombs
[28:41.530 --> 28:43.790]  and for like weeks now
[28:43.790 --> 28:45.070]  he says tombs.
[28:45.330 --> 28:47.510]  Whenever anyone asks what's toms is, so we've been
[28:47.510 --> 28:49.970]  loading him up to say tombs constantly.
[28:51.250 --> 28:52.230]  I'm gonna call him.
[28:52.850 --> 28:53.930]  He got this to work the other day
[28:53.930 --> 28:55.470]  on Halo and I could not believe it.
[28:55.750 --> 28:58.090]  Gavin lost it. He genuinely thinks the word
[28:58.090 --> 28:59.170]  toms is tombs.
[28:59.630 --> 29:02.030]  What is toms? Like a soother of the stomach
[29:02.030 --> 29:02.550]  sort of thing.
[29:04.210 --> 29:05.870]  Can you guys hear it?
[29:06.230 --> 29:06.450]  Yep.
[29:12.060 --> 29:13.200]  I don't know.
[29:16.560 --> 29:17.800]  Why isn't he picking up?
[29:18.560 --> 29:19.040]  This is disappointing.
[29:20.920 --> 29:21.540]  Yeah, no shit.
[29:22.640 --> 29:23.940]  I'll try calling him one more time
[29:23.940 --> 29:25.320]  but he fucking knows what toms is.
[29:27.620 --> 29:28.800]  He doesn't seem to get it.
[29:28.800 --> 29:30.940]  He thinks... Gavin has such a funny
[29:30.940 --> 29:32.520]  line where he's like, what does he think?
[29:32.640 --> 29:33.800]  Do you have a toomy ache?
[29:34.660 --> 29:36.640]  He just doesn't get it.
[29:37.540 --> 29:38.720]  Hello? Wait, hey.
[29:38.880 --> 29:39.320]  Hey, Jake.
[29:40.020 --> 29:42.180]  No, why are you upset?
[29:42.760 --> 29:44.200]  I'm having like my...
[29:44.200 --> 29:46.700]  I have like some anxiety, like heartburn.
[29:46.800 --> 29:48.000]  What is the thing you take for it?
[29:48.240 --> 29:49.800]  I think it starts with a...
[29:51.400 --> 29:52.860]  No, no, but I got like heartburn
[29:52.860 --> 29:54.480]  and you know like I need
[29:54.480 --> 29:56.080]  an anti-acid type thing.
[29:56.080 --> 29:57.420]  What is the...
[29:57.860 --> 29:58.620]  What is it, sorry?
[30:00.120 --> 30:01.800]  Okay, thank you. Thank you so much.
[30:02.140 --> 30:02.980]  I'll talk to you later.
[30:04.740 --> 30:05.360]  Love you, Jake.
[30:07.380 --> 30:07.980]  So he thinks
[30:07.980 --> 30:08.360]  it's tubes.
[30:16.740 --> 30:18.560]  Yeah, Jake, listen to this podcast.
[30:18.780 --> 30:20.140]  I'll make sure I'll tell him beforehand
[30:20.140 --> 30:21.460]  that he was on the show.
[30:22.480 --> 30:24.180]  So if you hear that
[30:24.180 --> 30:25.180]  wonderful tubes audio,
[30:25.180 --> 30:27.820]  that has been... I had to have
[30:27.820 --> 30:30.100]  a conversation with the people I regularly
[30:30.100 --> 30:32.080]  play games with of like, are we okay
[30:32.080 --> 30:34.440]  to sacrifice tubes? Because it has brought laughter
[30:34.440 --> 30:36.360]  to our life for weeks.
[30:36.920 --> 30:38.020]  Feeding him tubes.
[30:38.420 --> 30:38.940]  Jesus.
[30:39.820 --> 30:42.120]  This is like for an entire
[30:42.120 --> 30:44.020]  summer, I had Millie convinced they were
[30:44.020 --> 30:45.420]  flop flips, not flip flops.
[30:45.620 --> 30:47.940]  And she's like, you sound so weird
[30:47.940 --> 30:48.820]  when you say it that way.
[30:49.060 --> 30:52.300]  We went all over Hawaii
[30:52.300 --> 30:53.300]  and back in the old times.
[30:54.500 --> 30:56.340]  Flop flips, but she's not
[30:56.340 --> 30:58.460]  you know, 26 or however old Jake is.
[30:58.600 --> 30:59.640]  No, Jake's like 30.
[31:00.240 --> 31:02.000]  Jake's 30, walking around saying tubes.
[31:02.880 --> 31:04.380]  To be fair, why would
[31:04.380 --> 31:06.280]  he ever answer the phone between the hours
[31:06.280 --> 31:08.180]  of three and four central to Thursday?
[31:08.820 --> 31:10.360]  Yeah, I told... I talked to him for
[31:10.360 --> 31:12.260]  a minute before I did this that I said
[31:12.260 --> 31:14.140]  I have to go on this podcast.
[31:14.740 --> 31:15.960]  No, no better.
[31:16.320 --> 31:18.240]  I like that you used the same method to get him
[31:18.240 --> 31:19.760]  to say it as you did last time.
[31:19.760 --> 31:21.780]  On Halo, you said the exact
[31:21.780 --> 31:23.460]  same thing, like you had heartburn and
[31:23.460 --> 31:25.380]  he still went for it.
[31:25.820 --> 31:27.640]  He must be thinking like, why doesn't he remember?
[31:28.080 --> 31:28.700]  So easy.
[31:29.240 --> 31:31.640]  We had a conversation recently that we need to change
[31:31.640 --> 31:33.460]  our approach or else he is going to catch on
[31:33.460 --> 31:35.340]  if we all have heartburn every day.
[31:35.800 --> 31:36.740]  Constantly asking
[31:36.740 --> 31:39.060]  what we need to take for it.
[31:40.120 --> 31:41.140]  I love Jake.
[31:43.240 --> 31:43.720]  Tubes.
[31:44.540 --> 31:45.020]  Tubes!
[31:45.020 --> 31:45.160]  Tubes!
[31:52.210 --> 31:53.390]  Using the internet without
[31:53.390 --> 31:55.510]  ExpressVPN is like leaving your keys
[31:55.510 --> 31:57.450]  in your car while you run into the gas station
[31:57.450 --> 31:59.470]  for a snack. Most of the time you are probably
[31:59.470 --> 32:01.290]  fine, but what if you come back to see someone
[32:01.290 --> 32:02.470]  driving off with your car?
[32:03.090 --> 32:04.470]  Why does everyone need a VPN?
[32:05.130 --> 32:07.510]  Every time you connect to an unencrypted network
[32:07.510 --> 32:09.630]  like cafes, hotels, or airports
[32:09.630 --> 32:11.530]  any hacker on the same network
[32:11.530 --> 32:13.350]  can gain access to your personal data.
[32:13.810 --> 32:15.210]  Passwords, financial details,
[32:15.390 --> 32:17.410]  all that stuff. It doesn't take
[32:17.410 --> 32:19.290]  much technical knowledge to hack someone.
[32:19.730 --> 32:21.210]  Just some cheap hardware is needed.
[32:21.350 --> 32:22.790]  A smart 12 year old could do it.
[32:23.350 --> 32:25.410]  Your data is valuable. Hackers can
[32:25.410 --> 32:27.570]  make up to $1000 per person
[32:27.570 --> 32:29.510]  selling personal info on the dark
[32:29.510 --> 32:31.530]  web. Why use ExpressVPN?
[32:31.990 --> 32:33.570]  It has an encrypted tunnel.
[32:33.910 --> 32:35.410]  It creates a secure encrypted
[32:35.410 --> 32:37.470]  tunnel between your device and the internet.
[32:37.970 --> 32:39.390]  Hackers can't steal your
[32:39.390 --> 32:41.710]  sensitive data. Super secure!
[32:42.170 --> 32:43.310]  It'd take a hacker with a
[32:43.310 --> 32:45.370]  supercomputer over a billion years to get
[32:45.370 --> 32:47.190]  past ExpressVPN's encryption.
[32:47.830 --> 32:49.350]  Easy to use. Fire
[32:49.350 --> 32:51.190]  up the app and in one click
[32:51.710 --> 32:52.710]  everything's protected.
[32:53.390 --> 32:55.390]  Works on all devices. Phones,
[32:55.550 --> 32:57.070]  laptops, tablets, and more.
[32:57.270 --> 32:59.390]  So you can stay secure on the
[32:59.390 --> 33:01.170]  go. I recently used
[33:01.170 --> 33:03.390]  ExpressVPN to watch the Spelling
[33:03.390 --> 33:05.370]  Bee. It was only streaming in the US from what
[33:05.370 --> 33:07.390]  I could see. And I love the Spelling
[33:07.390 --> 33:09.170]  Bee. It's one of my favorite events to watch every year.
[33:09.250 --> 33:11.290]  So being able to easily access it because
[33:11.290 --> 33:12.710]  of ExpressVPN was awesome.
[33:13.550 --> 33:15.010]  This is more about security
[33:15.010 --> 33:16.810]  this read, but being able to access
[33:16.810 --> 33:18.750]  other countries' libraries of content
[33:18.750 --> 33:20.770]  is so cool. It's fantastic and
[33:20.770 --> 33:21.930]  it's so simple to use.

[33:56.850 --> 33:59.030]  Fume handcrafts wooden inhalers and uses
[33:59.030 --> 34:00.530]  cores infused with plant oils
[34:00.530 --> 34:02.310]  studied to curb cravings.
[34:02.410 --> 34:04.690]  They have flavors like Peppermint and Conquer with
[34:04.690 --> 34:06.990]  minty notes to simulate menthol cigarettes
[34:06.990 --> 34:08.910]  and other flavors like Cozy
[34:08.910 --> 34:10.990]  Chine Lemonberry Bliss for a sweeter
[34:10.990 --> 34:13.010]  experience. And all of their
[34:13.010 --> 34:14.950]  flavors are 100% natural.
[34:15.430 --> 34:17.170]  No harmful chemicals, no artificial
[34:17.170 --> 34:19.210]  flavors and absolutely no nicotine.
[34:19.670 --> 34:20.890]  Quitting is tough, but Fume
[34:20.890 --> 34:22.810]  really can't help. They've got thousands
[34:22.810 --> 34:25.010]  of 5 star reviews from smokers who have tried
[34:25.010 --> 34:26.370]  everything else and this worked.
[34:26.950 --> 34:28.910]  Also, if you're somebody who travels all the time
[34:28.910 --> 34:30.470]  as the world begins to open up more,
[34:30.930 --> 34:32.710]  it's amazing to have with you.
[34:32.830 --> 34:35.090]  Being able to have it with you in the air and in the airport
[34:35.090 --> 34:36.530]  is a huge difference maker.
[34:36.530 --> 34:38.730]  Whether you're a smoker or ex-smoker

[36:23.190 --> 36:24.670]  Um, I have a thing that we
[36:24.670 --> 36:26.670]  should talk about. Some people, cause I saw
[36:26.670 --> 36:28.370]  some misunderstanding of a thing.
[36:28.370 --> 36:29.190]  And it's fair.
[36:29.970 --> 36:31.650]  No, it's a fair misunderstanding.
[36:32.510 --> 36:34.290]  We need to talk about the grow tubes.
[36:34.630 --> 36:36.330]  Cause we're all very excited about them.
[36:36.410 --> 36:38.410]  People are excited about them. You mean
[36:38.410 --> 36:39.070]  this?
[36:40.610 --> 36:41.370]  You mean this?
[36:43.150 --> 36:43.830]  Wait, did
[36:44.350 --> 36:46.390]  they send you those? Cause I would like one
[36:46.390 --> 36:48.170]  but I need to clear. Okay, I need to
[36:48.170 --> 36:50.150]  I don't know if they would send me one cause it's RTX
[36:50.150 --> 36:52.070]  it's launching RTX. I sent you a
[36:52.470 --> 36:54.430]  video the day I got it. I know
[36:54.430 --> 36:56.130]  you did but I didn't know if you like grabbed it.
[36:56.130 --> 36:58.490]  Like I didn't know how you got that or if they mailed it to you.
[36:58.570 --> 37:00.210]  I'm sure they probably mailed it to you as well.
[37:00.230 --> 37:00.970]  Cool, awesome.
[37:01.930 --> 37:04.150]  So they're launching at RTX but they
[37:04.150 --> 37:06.010]  will be available online for everybody
[37:06.450 --> 37:08.150]  after the event. We just want
[37:08.150 --> 37:09.970]  the idea was we wanted to
[37:09.970 --> 37:12.450]  annoy as many people as possible
[37:12.450 --> 37:14.270]  so they're gonna drop on the event
[37:14.270 --> 37:16.250]  we're putting as much inventory as we can there
[37:16.250 --> 37:18.370]  so we can have as many grow tubes
[37:18.370 --> 37:19.990]  in a contained space
[37:20.530 --> 37:22.690]  cause that would be horrendous for everybody there.
[37:23.030 --> 37:24.270]  Do you remember a couple years
[37:24.270 --> 37:26.410]  ago during the World Cup when everybody got excited
[37:26.410 --> 37:27.370]  about Vuvuzela?
[37:27.990 --> 37:28.470]  Exactly.
[37:29.690 --> 37:32.450]  We're trying to recreate that magic at RTX this year.
[37:33.190 --> 37:33.990]  Exactly, yeah.
[37:34.370 --> 37:36.210]  I felt it was important to clarify in the
[37:36.210 --> 37:38.370]  merch meeting we had, somebody said it perfectly
[37:38.370 --> 37:40.290]  where everybody who wants one will get one
[37:40.290 --> 37:41.990]  so they're launching at RTX
[37:41.990 --> 37:44.170]  but they will be online too so if you're unable
[37:44.170 --> 37:46.050]  to attend that event you'll be in trouble.
[37:46.350 --> 37:47.870]  You're like a war general
[37:47.870 --> 37:50.150]  sending all of the troops to one place
[37:50.150 --> 37:51.850]  there's no room for any online
[37:51.850 --> 37:54.110]  we're sending everything to RTX first
[37:54.110 --> 37:55.910]  we need to fire everything
[37:57.150 --> 37:57.930]  I don't know
[37:57.930 --> 37:59.870]  I don't think, I'm assuming F***face doesn't
[37:59.870 --> 38:01.930]  have a panel considering you and I won't be
[38:01.930 --> 38:03.130]  there, Gavin, sadly.
[38:03.570 --> 38:05.410]  I don't know if that's true, it might just be me and Eric
[38:05.910 --> 38:07.390]  It's just you and Eric? That's great.
[38:08.130 --> 38:08.770]  Please record
[38:10.350 --> 38:11.770]  a whole room full of people
[38:11.770 --> 38:13.730]  if there is a panel, doing the grow tube at once
[38:13.730 --> 38:15.210]  I need to hear it. Yeah, it'll just be an hour.
[38:16.370 --> 38:17.470]  Oh, that's what I want.
[38:19.430 --> 38:19.910]  It's like
[38:19.910 --> 38:22.110]  when people at concerts get everyone
[38:22.110 --> 38:24.330]  to turn on their phone light and wave them at the same time
[38:24.330 --> 38:24.850]  Yeah, exactly.
[38:25.730 --> 38:28.010]  We're gonna have so many people, our tubes will groan out the sun
[38:28.010 --> 38:28.910]  It's gonna be amazing.
[38:29.410 --> 38:31.910]  When we eventually have our show
[38:31.910 --> 38:33.890]  in Vegas, I just love the idea of people having to
[38:33.890 --> 38:36.230]  travel with their groan tube, like having to bring it
[38:36.230 --> 38:37.150]  in uniform.
[38:40.790 --> 38:43.890]  Oh, I wonder if it would qualify for
[38:43.890 --> 38:45.890]  like, you know, you can't travel with liquid
[38:45.890 --> 38:47.230]  containers and stuff
[38:48.350 --> 38:49.310]  What's the volume
[38:49.310 --> 38:50.970]  of our groan tube? Oh, no.
[38:51.950 --> 38:53.450]  I'm sure it'll be fine.
[38:53.570 --> 38:54.310]  Can you imagine
[38:55.110 --> 38:56.170]  It's so loud!
[38:57.710 --> 38:59.210]  Can you imagine, like, trying
[38:59.210 --> 39:01.450]  to declare a fuck stick? Like, it'd be great.
[39:01.630 --> 39:03.050]  I wouldn't have to write that.
[39:04.230 --> 39:05.370]  So, Adilda, no.
[39:05.730 --> 39:06.450]  Goodness, no.
[39:07.070 --> 39:08.950]  It's ridiculous. This isn't sexual at all.
[39:09.110 --> 39:10.530]  It's a fuck stick. It's totally different.
[39:11.270 --> 39:13.010]  Oh, man. I never thought
[39:13.010 --> 39:15.210]  after the saga of
[39:15.210 --> 39:17.230]  the port-a-potty
[39:17.230 --> 39:19.350]  tiki mugs, I never thought we would have
[39:19.350 --> 39:21.290]  another piece of merchandise that was as
[39:21.290 --> 39:23.510]  complicated to get made and take as long.
[39:23.710 --> 39:25.090]  But boy, did the groan tubes
[39:25.090 --> 39:25.890]  not disappoint.
[39:27.070 --> 39:29.290]  Talking about the port-a-potty, just to clarify
[39:30.010 --> 39:30.750]  are you
[39:30.750 --> 39:32.650]  going to be home, Geoff, for your birthday?
[39:33.530 --> 39:35.350]  Is that... it's depending on Emily,
[39:35.430 --> 39:37.270]  I assume. Well, my birthday is a Sunday.
[39:38.430 --> 39:38.890]  So...
[39:38.890 --> 39:41.450]  Mail doesn't deliver on Sundays, typically, here in America.
[39:41.630 --> 39:42.190]  Why do you ask?
[39:42.190 --> 39:43.770]  I was just curious
[39:43.770 --> 39:46.150]  if you're going to be in the city or not.
[39:46.250 --> 39:48.390]  I'll be in the city. I'm going to be in town.
[39:48.670 --> 39:50.410]  I'm going to go swimming on my birthday.
[39:50.990 --> 39:52.030]  Good. Okay.
[39:52.330 --> 39:53.710]  I'll be in Austin.
[39:54.330 --> 39:56.050]  Awesome. Ready to accept
[39:57.050 --> 39:58.310]  whatever hell you
[39:58.810 --> 40:00.310]  are about to unleash on me.
[40:00.430 --> 40:02.310]  No, never. I just want to make sure.
[40:02.370 --> 40:04.070]  I got worried. If you're in Vegas,
[40:04.070 --> 40:06.310]  I would have to make some calls after we
[40:06.310 --> 40:08.230]  finish this recording. Well, I don't
[40:08.230 --> 40:10.690]  think there's any danger of me being in Vegas anytime soon.
[40:11.170 --> 40:12.210]  Ha ha ha.
[40:13.950 --> 40:14.950]  Poor, poor Emily.
[40:15.910 --> 40:16.710]  Meow Wolf is
[40:16.710 --> 40:17.970]  in Vegas, right?
[40:18.390 --> 40:20.250]  Yeah, there are
[40:20.830 --> 40:22.550]  five... so there are or will be five
[40:22.550 --> 40:24.630]  Meow Wolf locations. Santa Fe is the
[40:24.630 --> 40:26.410]  original, and then Vegas and Denver
[40:26.410 --> 40:28.210]  opened up a couple years ago, and now they're
[40:28.210 --> 40:29.710]  opening two in Texas, but not in Austin.
[40:30.510 --> 40:32.270]  We got to try that Gerpel drink, because I think
[40:32.270 --> 40:34.210]  all the people that... yeah, I think that's there.
[40:34.290 --> 40:36.530]  I just connected that when we're in Vegas for our show.
[40:36.610 --> 40:37.850]  We got to get some Gerpels.
[40:37.850 --> 40:39.170]  Yeah, we can totally do that.
[40:39.810 --> 40:40.730]  That sounds great.
[40:40.770 --> 40:43.230]  The show that I'm apparently not going to attend.
[40:43.610 --> 40:45.330]  I'll be blown away if you're there, Andrew.
[40:45.570 --> 40:46.830]  I'm 100% going to be there.
[40:47.370 --> 40:49.830]  I cannot wait to collect my $20 from Jack.
[40:50.050 --> 40:51.650]  It's going to be fantastic. Anybody else
[40:51.650 --> 40:53.890]  who wants to put wagers in, I'll gladly take them.
[40:54.210 --> 40:54.810]  Nick wrote, by the way,
[40:56.190 --> 40:57.770]  So, uh, I think I could squeeze
[40:57.770 --> 40:59.510]  into that. I think you could fit.
[40:59.830 --> 41:01.670]  And I think the harness, I just really...
[41:01.670 --> 41:03.490]  I want more clothing with harness holes.
[41:03.610 --> 41:04.690]  You never know when you need them.
[41:05.450 --> 41:06.590]  Maybe I could get lowered
[41:06.590 --> 41:08.490]  from the ceiling at the Vegas event.
[41:12.030 --> 41:14.450]  I'm going to write down
[41:14.450 --> 41:15.630]  to talk to Eric about this.
[41:16.510 --> 41:18.390]  I'll tell you this, Andrew, if you buy me
[41:18.390 --> 41:20.310]  a bunch of delicious Cosmic Crisp
[41:20.310 --> 41:21.910]  apples for my birthday and they show up,
[41:22.070 --> 41:24.510]  I'm not going to take one bite out of one, throw it in a river,
[41:24.550 --> 41:26.650]  and then dump the rest in a trash can on the way out.
[41:26.770 --> 41:28.710]  Who did that? Oh, I don't know.
[41:29.350 --> 41:30.190]  Was that Gavin?
[41:30.650 --> 41:31.390]  No, it was Eric.
[41:32.050 --> 41:33.610]  Oh, Eric did it. I see.
[41:34.150 --> 41:35.230]  So you said on the water,
[41:35.350 --> 41:37.010]  and since he's a near-the-water guy,
[41:37.130 --> 41:38.710]  I didn't associate that.
[41:38.710 --> 41:41.590]  He threw it in the water. We were on the boat.
[41:41.870 --> 41:42.310]  Oh.
[41:43.230 --> 41:44.110]  Got it.
[41:46.030 --> 41:47.550]  They had Cosmic Crisps
[41:47.550 --> 41:49.390]  in the grocery flyer
[41:49.390 --> 41:50.410]  where I get my groceries from.
[41:50.710 --> 41:53.430]  Made my week. It's a lucky week this week.
[41:53.690 --> 41:55.450]  I didn't realize that now we have
[41:55.450 --> 41:57.170]  cemented that people
[41:57.170 --> 41:59.230]  are going to notify us.
[42:00.030 --> 42:01.370]  I suspect for the rest
[42:01.370 --> 42:02.710]  of our individual lives
[42:03.130 --> 42:05.610]  about every new apple drop that comes out
[42:05.610 --> 42:06.730]  from here on. I don't hate it.
[42:06.770 --> 42:08.970]  I don't hate it either. I'm not a fan of it.
[42:09.570 --> 42:11.490]  It's like subscribing to a newsletter
[42:11.490 --> 42:13.010]  you forgot you subscribed to.
[42:13.690 --> 42:15.550]  Every once in a while, they just hit you up
[42:15.550 --> 42:17.030]  with, like, hey, there's a new yellow apple.
[42:17.130 --> 42:17.630]  Looks good.
[42:18.430 --> 42:19.970]  A vision to thank me later.
[42:21.270 --> 42:22.790]  Yeah, that's awesome. That's a great idea.
[42:23.210 --> 42:25.110]  I was going to say, because Eric's not here,
[42:25.450 --> 42:26.410]  we should do something.
[42:26.410 --> 42:28.110]  We would never do Wall-E's here,
[42:28.210 --> 42:30.170]  and we should all say one nice thing about him,
[42:30.190 --> 42:31.090]  because he'll never hear it.
[42:31.230 --> 42:34.310]  But then I got annoyed with him for not being here
[42:34.310 --> 42:36.470]  for a f***ing thing, so maybe I don't want to say nice stuff about him.
[42:37.590 --> 42:38.550]  I really feel like
[42:38.550 --> 42:40.230]  that was a conversation for you to have
[42:40.230 --> 42:41.150]  before we recorded.
[42:41.830 --> 42:43.730]  It feels like you're torn between ideas.
[42:43.970 --> 42:46.670]  Well, I didn't have a lot of choice. You were going on about your book club.
[42:47.030 --> 42:47.690]  My book club?
[42:48.290 --> 42:50.030]  Oh, that's fair. There was a lack of pleasantries.
[42:50.130 --> 42:52.490]  We're all throwing off from the lack of a pleasantry talk.
[42:52.630 --> 42:54.410]  What's that, Andrew? What's the best book you've read
[42:54.410 --> 42:55.430]  in the last 72 days?
[42:55.990 --> 42:57.370]  I don't think I've read a book.
[42:57.770 --> 43:00.230]  Maybe, like, the game manual
[43:00.230 --> 43:02.730]  for Fast and Furious Crossroads,
[43:02.830 --> 43:04.350]  I guess, if we want to call that a book.
[43:04.670 --> 43:05.770]  I don't think you can call that a book.
[43:06.030 --> 43:09.150]  Yeah, then I don't think I've read a book in the last 72 days.
[43:09.250 --> 43:10.610]  Why did you ask us
[43:10.610 --> 43:12.450]  if we'd read a book in the last 72 days?
[43:12.630 --> 43:14.010]  Because it's just pleasantry talk.
[43:14.250 --> 43:15.290]  No, it's just being silly.
[43:17.270 --> 43:18.090]  There's no reason.
[43:18.270 --> 43:19.350]  It was a completely random number.
[43:19.430 --> 43:21.970]  Why did I pick number 101 for the episode
[43:21.970 --> 43:23.470]  or the Palladio for Geoff or whatever?
[43:23.750 --> 43:24.210]  Just random.
[43:25.450 --> 43:26.910]  Zero logic went into it.
[43:27.590 --> 43:29.130]  Can I talk about one of my favorite events
[43:29.130 --> 43:31.470]  that I wish I would have talked about last week that happened?
[43:31.970 --> 43:32.830]  I missed out.
[43:33.090 --> 43:36.370]  The NBA Finals started
[43:36.370 --> 43:37.510]  on the same night
[43:37.510 --> 43:39.330]  as the greatest sporting event of the year.
[43:39.730 --> 43:41.370]  The Scripps National Spelling Bee.
[43:42.170 --> 43:43.190]  And boy, was it a barn burner.
[43:43.530 --> 43:44.190]  Did you pick a kid?
[43:44.750 --> 43:45.890]  I picked a kid?
[43:46.490 --> 43:48.550]  My favorite tradition continued.
[43:48.550 --> 43:50.270]  There's one person in our league
[43:50.270 --> 43:51.310]  who picked the child.
[43:52.310 --> 43:54.410]  Yep, I'm the Vancouver Tribe picker.
[43:58.730 --> 44:00.550]  The person that consistently
[44:00.550 --> 44:01.930]  takes the first kid eliminated
[44:01.930 --> 44:03.630]  got eliminated first once again.
[44:04.090 --> 44:05.650]  It was great. The disappointment,
[44:05.950 --> 44:08.310]  it was fantastic. My kid, I think, placed
[44:08.310 --> 44:10.330]  fifth. It was a wild show, Gavin.
[44:10.430 --> 44:12.290]  There was a woman whose child
[44:12.290 --> 44:14.470]  was eliminated and she
[44:14.470 --> 44:16.310]  left the stage and then 10 minutes later
[44:16.310 --> 44:18.410]  they said, actually, we fucked up.
[44:18.910 --> 44:20.350]  You can come back. You're back
[44:20.350 --> 44:21.170]  in this competition.
[44:21.770 --> 44:24.570]  So it was like a misspelling that was actually spelled correctly?
[44:25.010 --> 44:26.730]  No, it was like we...
[44:26.730 --> 44:28.330]  So the second round is they
[44:28.850 --> 44:30.350]  give... you have to guess the
[44:30.350 --> 44:32.470]  definition of a word. So they'll tell you
[44:32.470 --> 44:34.410]  what it is and they'll give you three options
[44:35.090 --> 44:36.470]  and technically how they
[44:36.470 --> 44:38.350]  phrased it, two of the three would
[44:38.350 --> 44:40.310]  be correct. And she picked one that
[44:40.310 --> 44:42.430]  they didn't view as correct, but upon review they're like
[44:42.430 --> 44:44.210]  ah, you could make the argument
[44:44.210 --> 44:46.130]  that that was the correct answer. So she
[44:46.130 --> 44:48.490]  got to come back. The show opened with
[44:48.490 --> 44:50.290]  a kid got an answer wrong
[44:50.290 --> 44:52.250]  in the round before. His
[44:52.250 --> 44:54.170]  parents disputed it and they
[44:54.170 --> 44:55.850]  decided he could enter the...
[44:55.850 --> 44:58.430]  His parents were very upset about it.
[44:59.150 --> 44:59.950]  And so
[44:59.950 --> 45:02.270]  they decided if he could spell
[45:02.270 --> 45:04.310]  one word correctly before the show
[45:04.310 --> 45:06.010]  started, he could then enter the finals.
[45:06.390 --> 45:08.210]  So the first, it opened with a spelling
[45:08.210 --> 45:10.370]  of a kid trying to get in. And he got
[45:10.370 --> 45:11.990]  it. I'm so glad. It would be so embarrassing
[45:11.990 --> 45:13.970]  to fuck that word up as the show was
[45:13.970 --> 45:16.090]  started. And you're just, yeah, no, you're
[45:16.670 --> 45:18.110]  double eliminated. Can you imagine that car
[45:18.110 --> 45:20.130]  ride home? Oh, it would be
[45:20.130 --> 45:20.690]  so awkward.
[45:21.930 --> 45:24.150]  Because he gave, he kind of had vibes of I'm not
[45:24.150 --> 45:25.610]  super into this, but my parents
[45:25.610 --> 45:28.150]  love this. His dad was so fucking pumped
[45:28.150 --> 45:29.910]  when he made it into the finals. He got it right.
[45:30.990 --> 45:32.110]  Um, so the girl
[45:32.110 --> 45:33.750]  got eliminated. She came back.
[45:34.230 --> 45:36.250]  It went into the very first
[45:36.250 --> 45:37.790]  spell off. The scripts
[45:38.290 --> 45:39.910]  spell off. So there's an overtime
[45:39.910 --> 45:41.750]  round. It's like penalty kicks
[45:41.750 --> 45:43.990]  where each kid goes up and they
[45:43.990 --> 45:45.990]  have to spell as many words as they
[45:45.990 --> 45:47.410]  can in 90 seconds.
[45:47.690 --> 45:50.010]  So like they feed them a word and then they have to
[45:50.010 --> 45:51.970]  spell it and they hit a buzzer and it goes to the
[45:51.970 --> 45:53.870]  next word. And they just go back and forth.
[45:53.970 --> 45:56.010]  And it is one of the craziest things
[45:56.010 --> 45:57.970]  I've ever seen. Holy shit. Speed
[45:57.970 --> 45:59.650]  spelling is wild.
[46:01.770 --> 46:02.170]  Uh,
[46:02.330 --> 46:03.950]  and didn't the girl who got
[46:03.950 --> 46:05.910]  the person who got kicked out and then brought back in win?
[46:06.410 --> 46:07.910]  She won it all. The girl that
[46:07.910 --> 46:10.050]  kicked out, she's unstoppable. Every time
[46:10.050 --> 46:12.010]  she'd come to the stage, I was making Terminator
[46:12.010 --> 46:13.830]  noises. You cannot Terminator. She would not
[46:13.830 --> 46:16.290]  go down. She was like dun dun dun dun dun.
[46:16.410 --> 46:17.950]  Every time. And she would just
[46:17.950 --> 46:20.010]  nail words. They got to that spell
[46:20.010 --> 46:21.890]  off. It was not, it was like she didn't breathe.
[46:22.250 --> 46:23.610]  She didn't leave 26 words.
[46:23.990 --> 46:25.190]  Oh, not even close.
[46:25.970 --> 46:27.870]  You think I fucking know these words when I can't even
[46:27.870 --> 46:29.870]  say ascetite or whatever the fuck that word
[46:29.870 --> 46:31.710]  was? I don't know. I don't know
[46:31.710 --> 46:33.670]  six letter words. I
[46:33.670 --> 46:36.010]  watched the spell off, Gavin
[46:36.010 --> 46:38.150]  and I'd never heard of any of those words ever
[46:38.150 --> 46:40.090]  before. And yeah, Andrew's not
[46:40.090 --> 46:42.170]  wrong. She had like the focus of a
[46:42.170 --> 46:43.950]  swan. She was locked in.
[46:45.150 --> 46:45.970]  Like a swan
[46:45.970 --> 46:47.410]  looking at your back. Yeah.
[46:49.270 --> 46:50.470]  She had my...
[46:50.470 --> 46:52.010]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:53.890 --> 46:54.650]  So what was the word
[46:54.650 --> 46:55.850]  with the definition
[46:55.850 --> 46:57.710]  that they gave her background?
[46:57.730 --> 46:59.890]  I don't remember. It was like something like
[46:59.890 --> 47:02.090]  it was a group of bees
[47:02.090 --> 47:03.970]  that meant like, I think the definition was it
[47:03.970 --> 47:05.830]  was like a group of a certain animal
[47:05.830 --> 47:07.770]  type, and they had two different animals
[47:07.770 --> 47:09.930]  listed. And she picked the wrong
[47:09.930 --> 47:11.870]  animal. And they're like, no, the correct answer is bee
[47:11.870 --> 47:14.050]  not... it's bees, not geese
[47:14.050 --> 47:15.870]  and they're like, well technically you can make the case
[47:15.870 --> 47:17.850]  that geese would also fall under...
[47:17.850 --> 47:19.830]  It's a weird like technicality thing.
[47:20.130 --> 47:21.190]  Like a murder of crows.
[47:21.670 --> 47:23.970]  Like, yes! Those are great. I love
[47:23.970 --> 47:26.150]  those, what you call specific animal groups.
[47:26.790 --> 47:27.930]  Murder of crows is a good one.
[47:28.210 --> 47:29.290]  How does that get decided?
[47:29.730 --> 47:31.950]  I mean, how do we decide any word? We've had
[47:31.950 --> 47:33.710]  this talk before. What would it be if
[47:34.570 --> 47:35.570]  podcasters were a group?
[47:35.990 --> 47:37.530]  Like coming towards you, what could you call it?
[47:37.630 --> 47:39.810]  Just unfortunate? General population?
[47:40.510 --> 47:41.950]  I don't know. Seems like everyone has
[47:41.950 --> 47:43.970]  a podcast. A general
[47:43.970 --> 47:45.510]  population of podcasters?
[47:45.830 --> 47:47.770]  No, it'd be like a
[47:48.650 --> 47:49.930]  group of podcasters
[47:49.930 --> 47:51.510]  are coming out of you, or podcast audiences?
[47:51.810 --> 47:53.930]  Like if all the three of us were coming
[47:53.930 --> 47:55.730]  towards you, what would the flock term be?
[47:56.010 --> 47:57.410]  It'd be a regulation of podcasters.
[47:58.690 --> 48:00.290]  Oh, regulation podcaster?
[48:00.290 --> 48:02.610]  Is that what you said? Yeah. A regulation!
[48:02.970 --> 48:03.870]  They would be a regulation.
[48:03.970 --> 48:06.370]  That's what I said. A regulation of podcasters.
[48:06.710 --> 48:08.270]  Yeah, you're right. I misheard.
[48:09.950 --> 48:10.390]  Podcast
[48:10.390 --> 48:12.170]  leavers, Nick says.
[48:15.390 --> 48:15.970]  Where's Steve?
[48:15.970 --> 48:17.930]  I appreciate you coming up with regulation, Geoff,
[48:17.970 --> 48:20.450]  because I was trying, and I just could not...
[48:20.450 --> 48:21.410]  I couldn't find it.
[48:21.770 --> 48:22.690]  I did my best.
[48:24.010 --> 48:25.850]  I was looking for it. I thought
[48:25.850 --> 48:27.950]  ad readers were okay, but I was like,
[48:28.050 --> 48:30.070]  eh, but regulation. A regulation
[48:30.070 --> 48:31.730]  is such a better natural fit.
[48:32.170 --> 48:34.010]  You found the wolf. I wonder if that applies to any
[48:34.010 --> 48:35.530]  other animal. What do you mean?
[48:35.930 --> 48:36.490]  A regulation.
[48:37.270 --> 48:39.830]  Oh, you think there's a group of animals called a regulation?
[48:40.190 --> 48:41.990]  Yeah. List of animal
[48:41.990 --> 48:43.970]  groupings. Like a regulation of buffalo or something.
[48:44.310 --> 48:46.290]  If it was gonna, like it obviously doesn't,
[48:46.350 --> 48:47.630]  but if it was going to,
[48:47.950 --> 48:49.610]  what animal do you think it would be?
[48:50.790 --> 48:51.150]  Ooh.
[48:51.890 --> 48:53.890]  What's like the most bog standard animal?
[48:55.290 --> 48:56.110]  I hate
[48:56.110 --> 48:58.150]  that with the amount of time I've spent
[48:58.150 --> 49:00.110]  with you, my brain said the exact same
[49:00.110 --> 49:00.410]  thing.
[49:01.750 --> 49:03.890]  Internally, I just said that. I fucking hate
[49:03.890 --> 49:06.190]  this. There's no way that I'm naturally saying
[49:06.190 --> 49:07.930]  that. I've just spent too much time with you.
[49:08.170 --> 49:09.210]  Bog standard.
[49:11.910 --> 49:13.650]  Like what animal do you think of if
[49:13.650 --> 49:14.610]  you think of an animal?
[49:16.770 --> 49:17.210]  Uh...
[49:17.210 --> 49:20.310]  See, I was thinking large too
[49:20.310 --> 49:21.290]  in kind of the same area.
[49:21.510 --> 49:23.970]  I think it's funnier if it's like an animal
[49:23.970 --> 49:24.930]  you don't see often.
[49:25.470 --> 49:27.010]  Like a regulation of giraffes.
[49:28.230 --> 49:29.190]  A regulation of giraffes
[49:29.190 --> 49:31.290]  isn't bad. The first thing that came to my mind
[49:31.290 --> 49:33.210]  and I feel pretty good about is a regulation
[49:33.210 --> 49:33.850]  of dolphins.
[49:34.730 --> 49:36.690]  But I'm a water guy.
[49:37.830 --> 49:38.090]  Yeah.
[49:39.070 --> 49:40.050]  Regulation of dolphins.
[49:40.470 --> 49:43.010]  I immediately went to land. I feel like land is the standard.
[49:43.490 --> 49:45.210]  But I guess there is more water than land
[49:45.210 --> 49:47.170]  on Earth. I think water is the
[49:47.170 --> 49:47.750]  standard, buddy.
[49:49.150 --> 49:50.970]  I'm saying, I'm turning around to it.
[49:51.530 --> 49:52.970]  A group of goldfish is
[49:52.970 --> 49:54.470]  apparently called a troubling.
[49:54.830 --> 49:55.570]  Which is great.
[49:58.650 --> 49:59.810]  That's what we would be.
[50:00.870 --> 50:02.570]  What would you call two
[50:02.570 --> 50:04.530]  clusters of goldfish? Troublings?
[50:05.090 --> 50:06.810]  What? Double trouble, Andrew!
[50:07.150 --> 50:07.550]  Oh!
[50:09.190 --> 50:10.930]  I'm glad I didn't make that joke.
[50:11.230 --> 50:12.930]  I was
[50:13.590 --> 50:14.950]  happy that I missed.
[50:15.250 --> 50:16.770]  First time I've ever thought this.
[50:16.910 --> 50:18.510]  But should we end the podcast already after that?
[50:19.370 --> 50:20.270]  Double trouble?
[50:20.270 --> 50:22.130]  I think if that's where we are,
[50:22.270 --> 50:22.930]  maybe we...
[50:22.930 --> 50:25.130]  A double troubling of goldfish?
[50:29.250 --> 50:29.890]  I like
[50:29.890 --> 50:31.890]  flamingo as a flamboyance. A group of
[50:31.890 --> 50:33.170]  flamingos. Flamboyance.
[50:33.530 --> 50:36.170]  Coyotes are a band! A band of coyotes!
[50:36.330 --> 50:37.170]  That's fucking cool!
[50:37.550 --> 50:39.990]  This is where Eric, if he was here, would be yelling at us to stop
[50:39.990 --> 50:41.430]  just reading stuff off the internet.
[50:42.110 --> 50:43.410]  This is part of the show.
[50:43.630 --> 50:44.910]  Nick said that is cool.
[50:44.910 --> 50:46.150]  So I think Nick's in.
[50:48.330 --> 50:48.970]  I want to be in a
[50:48.970 --> 50:50.950]  band. A swarm
[50:51.450 --> 50:52.890]  for bees. Yeah, I mean,
[50:52.910 --> 50:54.910]  there's some shit ones, but...
[50:54.910 --> 50:56.930]  Caterpillars are an army! An army of
[50:56.930 --> 50:58.830]  caterpillars! Who decides these?
[50:59.470 --> 51:00.270]  I don't know!
[51:00.710 --> 51:02.910]  That's a great question. Who does decide these?
[51:03.410 --> 51:04.850]  I wonder how many caterpillars
[51:04.850 --> 51:06.250]  is required for an army.
[51:06.770 --> 51:08.850]  Because when you say army, it makes you think
[51:08.850 --> 51:10.290]  hundreds. Like in columns.
[51:11.090 --> 51:13.090]  I think of like, there needs to be a set
[51:13.090 --> 51:15.310]  of tiers. Like, you need a general.
[51:16.310 --> 51:17.030]  You could have
[51:17.030 --> 51:19.050]  five people, and if one of them is like
[51:19.050 --> 51:21.010]  a general and a sergeant, I think you're an army.
[51:21.550 --> 51:22.350]  Yeah, I don't think
[51:23.110 --> 51:25.050]  caterpillars are like a hive mind. I assume there's
[51:25.050 --> 51:27.130]  a hierarchy there, that there's a lead
[51:27.130 --> 51:27.910]  caterpillar, right?
[51:29.490 --> 51:30.350]  It's not like ants.
[51:31.030 --> 51:32.490]  And even then, ants have a queen, right?
[51:32.690 --> 51:35.170]  I think the great play of, if you refer to yourself
[51:35.170 --> 51:36.790]  as an army, there is an implied
[51:36.790 --> 51:38.630]  largeness that doesn't have to be there.
[51:39.090 --> 51:41.150]  Like, if we said we are an army,
[51:41.150 --> 51:42.790]  many people would assume there's more of us,
[51:42.850 --> 51:44.930]  and there might not be. That just might be a good
[51:44.930 --> 51:46.870]  strategic decision. Caterpillars
[51:46.870 --> 51:48.550]  maybe just want to seem bigger than they are.
[51:49.430 --> 51:50.910]  How many in
[51:50.910 --> 51:51.970]  an army?
[51:53.370 --> 51:55.130]  You think there's a clear line?
[51:55.270 --> 51:56.750]  I'd be shocked if there was like a
[51:56.750 --> 51:58.050]  definitive number.
[51:58.910 --> 51:59.850]  Yeah, this is useless.
[52:00.530 --> 52:01.350]  It would be useless.
[52:02.450 --> 52:03.530]  Okay, so,
[52:04.790 --> 52:06.690]  the dictionary definition of army
[52:06.690 --> 52:09.030]  is an organized military force
[52:09.030 --> 52:10.950]  equipped for fighting on land.
[52:11.290 --> 52:13.010]  So, really, if you could
[52:13.010 --> 52:14.970]  organize two people, I think two people could technically
[52:14.970 --> 52:16.750]  be an army. As long as they're on land.
[52:16.930 --> 52:18.950]  It wouldn't be dolphins. No such thing as an army of
[52:18.950 --> 52:19.270]  dolphins.
[52:20.790 --> 52:22.990]  That's a great point. That would be terrifying
[52:22.990 --> 52:24.050]  though. Isn't that a movie?
[52:24.710 --> 52:26.710]  There's a movie about that, right? An Army of Dolphins?
[52:27.030 --> 52:28.830]  Or is it one... there's a movie
[52:28.830 --> 52:31.090]  where the dolphin is trying to assassinate a president.
[52:31.550 --> 52:32.310]  That's a movie.
[52:32.770 --> 52:33.690]  But I don't know if that's an army.
[52:34.210 --> 52:35.870]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[52:35.870 --> 52:36.730]  There's...
[52:37.730 --> 52:39.470]  I didn't make that up, I don't think.
[52:39.650 --> 52:41.590]  Dolphin assassinate
[52:41.590 --> 52:42.850]  president movie.
[52:43.610 --> 52:45.570]  They like train a dolphin to kill the president.
[52:45.810 --> 52:46.810]  The Day of the Dolphin.
[52:47.130 --> 52:49.010]  I was hoping so much that was a dream.
[52:51.450 --> 52:53.890]  Marine biologists Jake and Maggie Terrell
[52:53.890 --> 52:55.430]  have for many years been doing dolphin
[52:55.430 --> 52:57.670]  research in Florida Keys and have even coached
[52:57.670 --> 52:59.510]  some dolphins to speak primitive English.
[52:59.810 --> 53:01.390]  But when two of the dolphins are kidnapped,
[53:01.510 --> 53:03.930]  an investigation proves that Terrell's financial backers,
[53:03.930 --> 53:05.850]  the Franklin Foundation, have had
[53:05.850 --> 53:07.690]  a sinister intention all along.
[53:07.970 --> 53:10.170]  The dolphins are to be used to deliver and detonate
[53:10.170 --> 53:12.050]  explosives beneath the president's yacht.
[53:12.710 --> 53:13.110]  I was right!
[53:13.570 --> 53:15.750]  What is this movie called? The Day of the Dolphin.
[53:16.070 --> 53:17.610]  The Day... alright, hold on.
[53:18.010 --> 53:19.990]  The Day of the Dolphin.
[53:20.190 --> 53:21.310]  Could you imagine me...
[53:21.310 --> 53:24.010]  That the tagline of a movie
[53:24.010 --> 53:26.250]  is, unwittingly he trained
[53:26.250 --> 53:27.830]  a dolphin to kill the president
[53:27.830 --> 53:30.290]  of the United States. That's what you're gonna put on there?
[53:30.850 --> 53:31.790]  Dude, it's got
[53:31.790 --> 53:34.030]  George C. Scott in it. It's got Patton
[53:34.030 --> 53:35.250]  in it. Oh, that's amazing.
[53:36.290 --> 53:37.810]  Stream. Where are we
[53:37.810 --> 53:40.250]  gonna watch this and make a video out of it?
[53:40.270 --> 53:41.590]  Oh, we can watch it on Amazon Prime.
[53:41.950 --> 53:43.690]  Perfect. We'll add it to...
[53:43.690 --> 53:45.890]  We're watching MVP2. What's the other one?
[53:46.370 --> 53:47.830]  I think we agreed on a different movie
[53:47.830 --> 53:49.530]  recently as well. MVP2.
[53:49.630 --> 53:50.370]  Day of the Dolphin.
[53:51.750 --> 53:52.650]  There's something else.
[53:53.290 --> 53:54.950]  There was discussion of Anaconda.
[53:56.110 --> 53:57.510]  There was. That's a great movie.
[53:57.510 --> 53:58.790]  I don't know if we need to do that.
[53:58.790 --> 54:00.670]  Honestly, I'd rather...
[54:00.670 --> 54:02.870]  I think Lake Placid is a better version of
[54:02.870 --> 54:03.830]  that movie. Really?
[54:05.290 --> 54:06.810]  There's only one part of Lake
[54:06.810 --> 54:08.770]  Placid I really enjoy and it's the
[54:08.770 --> 54:10.770]  fact that there's a character in it that
[54:10.770 --> 54:12.550]  is like a specialist in
[54:12.550 --> 54:14.670]  alligators or whatever. And he
[54:14.670 --> 54:16.770]  sets all these traps up and only one of
[54:16.770 --> 54:18.330]  the main characters keeps stepping in them.
[54:18.910 --> 54:20.790]  It never actually impacts the character
[54:20.790 --> 54:22.690]  and it's like a running gag throughout
[54:22.690 --> 54:24.790]  the movie that this one guy gets stuck in six
[54:24.790 --> 54:26.670]  of his traps and there's no payoff
[54:26.670 --> 54:28.890]  to it. It's just this thing that keeps happening
[54:28.890 --> 54:30.850]  throughout the film and I really enjoy that.
[54:31.210 --> 54:32.610]  It's a dumb movie.
[54:32.790 --> 54:33.090]  It's great.
[54:33.310 --> 54:36.750]  It's alligator Anaconda.
[54:37.730 --> 54:37.890]  Yeah.
[54:38.350 --> 54:40.850]  But I feel like to a lesser extent, I think Anaconda
[54:40.850 --> 54:42.890]  is more schlocky than Lake Placid.
[54:43.670 --> 54:44.670]  Lake Placid is dumb.
[54:45.010 --> 54:46.670]  Anaconda is schlocky. I'll say this.
[54:46.830 --> 54:48.870]  Lake Placid has Betty White in it.
[54:49.350 --> 54:49.890]  It does.
[54:50.670 --> 54:51.550]  It is true.
[54:53.110 --> 54:54.750]  The legend. I wonder who won that
[54:54.750 --> 54:56.710]  contest. And I wonder if they
[54:56.710 --> 54:58.790]  regret running that contest. I talked about
[54:58.790 --> 55:00.750]  it on the show before. She died
[55:00.750 --> 55:02.070]  so shortly after that.
[55:02.650 --> 55:04.870]  It was to celebrate her 100th, which I don't
[55:04.870 --> 55:06.230]  think she reached, sadly.
[55:06.690 --> 55:07.710]  She was so close.
[55:07.950 --> 55:10.690]  She was so close. I have a question
[55:10.690 --> 55:11.990]  about when
[55:12.610 --> 55:13.830]  you tell a story
[55:14.650 --> 55:16.030]  on this show.
[55:16.730 --> 55:18.610]  Something that happened in your personal life.
[55:19.330 --> 55:20.450]  And you tell it to
[55:20.450 --> 55:22.730]  somebody involved. When you fill
[55:22.730 --> 55:24.750]  somebody else in on the story, when you're doing your first telling
[55:24.750 --> 55:26.390]  of the story, how often
[55:26.390 --> 55:28.610]  do you hear a different perspective
[55:28.610 --> 55:30.850]  of what you're going to tell? How often
[55:30.850 --> 55:32.670]  does that improve the story to you, or
[55:32.670 --> 55:34.410]  change your perspective on it?
[55:34.590 --> 55:36.790]  What's an example? The shampoo
[55:36.790 --> 55:38.550]  bottle story that I told
[55:38.550 --> 55:40.570]  in the episode that just came out.
[55:41.210 --> 55:42.710]  The following day,
[55:42.930 --> 55:44.650]  the first person I told that story to
[55:44.650 --> 55:46.690]  was my partner. And as
[55:46.690 --> 55:48.690]  I'm telling the story, and I'm halfway through,
[55:49.170 --> 55:50.490]  they cut me off and immediately
[55:50.490 --> 55:52.590]  just said, wait, you had my shampoo
[55:52.590 --> 55:53.910]  bottle in your ass?
[55:54.050 --> 55:56.390]  In disgust. Which is
[55:56.390 --> 55:58.470]  an aspect of it that I never
[55:58.470 --> 56:00.650]  considered. I never thought
[56:00.650 --> 56:02.630]  about that that would be way worse
[56:02.630 --> 56:04.390]  than waking them up, that they now have
[56:04.390 --> 56:06.670]  my ass all over
[56:06.670 --> 56:08.510]  the bottle. I've been putting
[56:08.510 --> 56:10.690]  it on my hair? Yeah, like
[56:10.690 --> 56:12.550]  I'm going to have to grab this bottle all the
[56:12.550 --> 56:14.690]  time that was in your ass now? Thank you
[56:14.690 --> 56:16.390]  for the kindness of doing that.
[56:17.170 --> 56:18.670]  Just curious if you guys had
[56:18.670 --> 56:20.750]  examples of different...
[56:21.350 --> 56:22.470]  I'll say that
[56:22.470 --> 56:24.450]  Emily, at least in my experience,
[56:24.610 --> 56:26.750]  is a one-person comedy
[56:26.750 --> 56:28.750]  writing room. And so when I'm
[56:28.750 --> 56:30.730]  going through and telling the
[56:30.730 --> 56:32.470]  swan story or working it out,
[56:33.050 --> 56:34.630]  she'll be like, yeah, but
[56:34.630 --> 56:36.590]  didn't this kind of happen? Or don't forget about
[56:36.590 --> 56:38.410]  this thing. Or like in Go! Go! Now,
[56:38.750 --> 56:39.830]  she'd be like, oh, it
[56:40.430 --> 56:42.730]  was funny the way you said it this time. Be sure to say it like
[56:42.730 --> 56:44.750]  that. And I
[56:44.750 --> 56:45.730]  find it to be invaluable.
[56:45.730 --> 56:47.730]  Yeah, what is it they say about
[56:47.730 --> 56:49.590]  when you tell a story, you're only telling it
[56:49.590 --> 56:51.870]  from like the... you're only telling
[56:51.870 --> 56:53.710]  the last time you remembered it. So like the more
[56:53.710 --> 56:55.770]  you tell it or like the more time between
[56:55.770 --> 56:57.890]  it just gets less accurate over time.
[56:58.210 --> 56:59.790]  I find that a lot with...
[56:59.790 --> 57:01.790]  if I tell a story like 10 times and
[57:01.790 --> 57:03.770]  then I tell it for the 11th time and someone
[57:03.770 --> 57:05.910]  from the original moment was there,
[57:06.250 --> 57:07.610]  they'll add in stuff that I've forgotten. I'm like,
[57:07.670 --> 57:09.710]  oh, how did I leave that out? And it's so
[57:10.450 --> 57:11.470]  overwritten by the
[57:11.470 --> 57:12.650]  other times I've told it.
[57:12.650 --> 57:14.670]  It's part of why I'm having so
[57:14.670 --> 57:16.650]  much fun doing that other show with Gus is
[57:16.650 --> 57:18.610]  because we're retelling stories from like
[57:18.610 --> 57:20.650]  the early days of Roost Teeth that we haven't
[57:20.650 --> 57:22.310]  told in years and years and years.
[57:22.630 --> 57:24.450]  And he reminds me of like
[57:24.450 --> 57:26.790]  entire events that I'd forgotten about, you know,
[57:27.050 --> 57:28.850]  just spun off of like one story
[57:28.850 --> 57:30.610]  and it's like, it's awesome.
[57:32.010 --> 57:32.770]  So that other
[57:32.770 --> 57:34.730]  show you do, I didn't mean to bring this up,
[57:34.770 --> 57:36.310]  is Anima, it's a podcast,
[57:36.530 --> 57:38.630]  ANMA. It has been such
[57:38.630 --> 57:40.470]  a delight to listen to that show.
[57:40.470 --> 57:42.510]  Really? Yeah, I've really
[57:42.510 --> 57:44.470]  enjoyed it because I love you
[57:44.470 --> 57:46.550]  and we have this great friendship, but I also
[57:46.550 --> 57:48.110]  think you're so funny in content
[57:48.110 --> 57:50.450]  and the thing like F*** Face, I don't
[57:50.450 --> 57:52.450]  listen to it at all, as we've covered for
[57:52.450 --> 57:54.110]  reasons that you displayed perfectly
[57:54.110 --> 57:56.470]  earlier in this episode. There's nothing
[57:56.470 --> 57:58.290]  that'll make you hate yourself faster than
[57:58.290 --> 58:00.550]  re-listening to something you're part of. I'm so
[58:00.550 --> 58:02.670]  thankful, Gavin, that you're willing to prove these for us.
[58:03.950 --> 58:04.590]  So I've
[58:04.590 --> 58:06.510]  missed seeing you in content and to like
[58:06.510 --> 58:08.490]  listen to a thing where you're
[58:08.490 --> 58:10.390]  so funny and it's such a
[58:10.390 --> 58:11.990]  relaxed environment for a show
[58:12.490 --> 58:14.450]  and the friendship between you and Gus is so genuine.
[58:14.590 --> 58:16.470]  It has been such a joy to listen
[58:16.470 --> 58:17.930]  to that show. So I'd highly
[58:18.450 --> 58:20.570]  recommend anybody who listens to F*** Face to check out ANMA.
[58:20.990 --> 58:22.790]  It's a great series,
[58:22.930 --> 58:24.590]  especially if you love Geoff.
[58:25.130 --> 58:26.070]  Well, thank you, Andrew.
[58:26.150 --> 58:28.410]  And you haven't been exposed to Gus, maybe.
[58:28.530 --> 58:30.230]  If you're outside of the Rooster Teeth world.
[58:30.870 --> 58:32.390]  He's a tour de force
[58:32.390 --> 58:34.110]  in his own right. Can I...
[58:34.110 --> 58:36.510]  A Gus thing that I feel like I keep
[58:36.510 --> 58:38.470]  meaning to bring up, and I'm so glad that this conversation
[58:38.470 --> 58:40.590]  led me to this thought. Before
[58:41.090 --> 58:42.610]  BreakShit started, we've done
[58:42.610 --> 58:43.970]  several of them at this point.
[58:44.210 --> 58:46.510]  Nearly a year. I feel like the
[58:46.510 --> 58:48.650]  starting point of BreakShit was the fact
[58:48.650 --> 58:50.430]  that Gus has a
[58:50.430 --> 58:52.790]  f***ing garage filled with baseball cards
[58:52.790 --> 58:54.570]  and it has never been mentioned
[58:54.570 --> 58:56.290]  or searched for. What is this?
[58:56.390 --> 58:58.490]  Does he still have them? Are we ever going to
[58:58.490 --> 59:00.530]  get those cards? It's so funny.
[59:00.710 --> 59:02.350]  It's so funny you mentioned that because
[59:02.350 --> 59:04.450]  that popped into my head. I'm actually
[59:04.450 --> 59:06.210]  I actually tweeted a photo earlier today. I'm
[59:06.210 --> 59:08.250]  trying to consolidate all the
[59:08.890 --> 59:10.370]  f***face BreakShit stuff because it's just
[59:10.370 --> 59:12.170]  in boxes around my house and in my car.
[59:12.490 --> 59:14.370]  And I'm trying to make some sense out of it because hopefully
[59:14.370 --> 59:16.390]  at some point we'll move into a
[59:16.390 --> 59:18.370]  studio that has a set
[59:18.370 --> 59:20.370]  that I can design and leave. Because right now I
[59:20.370 --> 59:22.550]  have to tear it down and build it up and tear it down
[59:22.550 --> 59:24.550]  every time. It's a f***ing transient
[59:24.550 --> 59:26.590]  nightmare. And
[59:26.590 --> 59:28.450]  that popped into my head. I'm like, oh right, doesn't Gus
[59:28.450 --> 59:30.370]  have like 40,000 baseball cards we're supposed
[59:30.370 --> 59:32.710]  to get? We just gotta do it.
[59:32.710 --> 59:34.630]  Like at the time he mentioned
[59:34.630 --> 59:36.670]  it, I thought it would be fun to
[59:36.670 --> 59:38.670]  make like a little docu thing about
[59:38.670 --> 59:40.770]  it and like document driving down there together
[59:40.770 --> 59:42.690]  and like make a little video out
[59:42.690 --> 59:44.450]  of it. But at this point I just want to get him.
[59:44.710 --> 59:46.690]  You know, if he still has access to him, which I
[59:46.690 --> 59:48.590]  think he does. I'm glad you brought it up
[59:48.590 --> 59:50.430]  because I feel like it could be a huge
[59:50.430 --> 59:52.590]  and fun thing for us to f*** with.
[59:53.050 --> 59:54.590]  And it just kind of, like a lot of
[59:54.590 --> 59:56.590]  f***face jokes, it just kind of
[59:56.590 --> 59:58.710]  fell by the wayside for other stuff. Yeah, I'd
[59:58.710 --> 01:00:00.130]  love to have an update for that.
[01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:02.030]  Or if you guys even just like recorded
[01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:03.830]  in a car, like on the road
[01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:05.030]  podcast.
[01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:08.150]  I don't know. That would be fun. That would be really fun.
[01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:10.250]  And I haven't been down to like the town
[01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:11.730]  where he grew up. I used to go down there
[01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:14.350]  early on in our friendship and like spend the weekend with his mom
[01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:16.330]  and him and explore Mexico
[01:00:16.330 --> 01:00:16.650]  and stuff.
[01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:19.110]  Why are you laughing at that?
[01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:21.970]  That just seems weird. I just, you would
[01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:23.230]  never do that now. That's so funny.
[01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:25.490]  Oh yeah, no, there's no way.
[01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:28.130]  Well yeah, the difference between being
[01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:30.310]  46 and 26 is pretty stark.
[01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:32.230]  Yeah. But weren't you still married
[01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:34.210]  back then? Yeah, sometimes.
[01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:35.430]  I'd go away for the weekend.
[01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:38.230]  I don't know why that's weird
[01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:40.090]  to me. Yeah, you'd just be like, I'm gonna
[01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:41.170]  go spend two days
[01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:43.970]  with Gus's family. Yeah, I've done that
[01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:45.950]  a bunch of times while I was married. And then also
[01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:47.790]  I was at work for a while. That's great. Yeah.
[01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:49.370]  Fantastic.
[01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:52.130]  Nick had to
[01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:53.690]  do the Eric thing and tell us to wrap up.
[01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:55.610]  He did. F*** you, Nick.
[01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:00.690]  There are times
[01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:01.910]  where, like, between
[01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:04.150]  recordings, we'll be texting each other a lot.
[01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:05.990]  I don't know, at least from my side, it was very quiet.
[01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:07.830]  I think we were all busy the last week. This is nice.
[01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:10.230]  This felt like a really relaxed, like,
[01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:11.870]  get-together-catch-up type episode.
[01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:14.030]  Is it bad that, since it was mentioned,
[01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:15.810]  I couldn't think of a single nice thing to say
[01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:16.170]  about Eric?
[01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:22.250]  Well, I would give you homework,
[01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:24.230]  but we don't wanna do that
[01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.650]  to Andrew.
[01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:26.390]  No!
[01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:27.590]  Not again!
[01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:30.310]  I was gonna say, because I was struggling, too.
[01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:34.590]  He's got a good... I like his fashion sense.
[01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:36.330]  I think he dresses well. I'm into it.
[01:01:37.550 --> 01:01:37.910]  Really?
[01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:39.610]  He's got a good style.
[01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:42.530]  I think he's very fun.
[01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:44.730]  He reminds me of...
[01:01:44.730 --> 01:01:45.870]  He's older than me, but it's like,
[01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:48.790]  hanging out with him is like hanging out with someone when I was in my 20s.
[01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:50.870]  Yeah. And I think that's nice about him.
[01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:52.570]  I will say, one thing
[01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:54.150]  that I like about Eric
[01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:56.750]  is just the longevity of how long
[01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:57.990]  I've known him.
[01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:59.570]  And in the different contexts.
[01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:01.510]  Because he was like...
[01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:04.010]  He would help out and was a part of Mega64,
[01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:06.490]  which was a group of peers
[01:02:07.110 --> 01:02:08.190]  in the internet space
[01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:09.410]  that we would do events with and stuff.
[01:02:09.490 --> 01:02:11.210]  And so we've known him for, I don't know,
[01:02:11.290 --> 01:02:12.970]  since year three of Rooster Teeth.
[01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:15.170]  So probably 15 years or something.
[01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:18.650]  But I knew him in the context of getting a beer with him
[01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:20.530]  at a convention in Iowa.
[01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:22.770]  Or, you know, being next to...
[01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:24.610]  Like, throwing t-shirts
[01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:26.570]  at him across the aisle
[01:02:26.570 --> 01:02:28.530]  at Comic-Con or whatever.
[01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:30.610]  And it is so weird
[01:02:30.610 --> 01:02:32.730]  now that we make a show together.
[01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:34.370]  Yeah. I mean,
[01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:35.910]  the f*** face as a whole, I think,
[01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:38.490]  that it came together at all is a bizarre thing.
[01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:40.570]  Yeah, he went from someone who I tried
[01:02:40.570 --> 01:02:42.390]  to ignore as much as possible to someone
[01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:44.630]  I now listen to whenever he
[01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:45.110]  says anything.
[01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:47.810]  I always thought that he was...
[01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:49.590]  Like, this is gonna
[01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:50.690]  border on being too nice,
[01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:52.570]  but I'll be honest.
[01:02:53.090 --> 01:02:55.110]  I love that group, the Mega64 guys.
[01:02:55.330 --> 01:02:57.310]  I love all of them in their own way.
[01:02:58.530 --> 01:02:59.750]  Although I love...
[01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:01.010]  Well, no, I'm not gonna pick favorites.
[01:03:01.330 --> 01:03:03.250]  I think they're all great, but I always thought
[01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:05.350]  Eric was the funniest among them.
[01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:06.590]  And I always thought it was strange. I was like,
[01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:09.490]  the guy that's helping them out is a little bit funnier than the rest of them.
[01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:10.390]  I wonder why that is.
[01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:13.810]  He's my favorite.
[01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:15.450]  There are certain topics
[01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:16.710]  that...
[01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:18.950]  He's the person I will talk to you about.
[01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:20.930]  I was on Twitter the other day,
[01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:23.530]  and I saw this thread where somebody who used to produce
[01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:25.550]  podcasts for the WWE left
[01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:27.250]  and was talking about that experience.
[01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:28.910]  And they said that Geoff Hardy
[01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:31.610]  has the worst Wi-Fi they've ever encountered.
[01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:33.230]  And that he was wonderful,
[01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:35.590]  but just the most absolutely
[01:03:35.590 --> 01:03:36.950]  dismal Wi-Fi.
[01:03:37.290 --> 01:03:39.610]  And just like, please get some better fucking Wi-Fi,
[01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:41.210]  Geoff Hardy. And I said that to Eric.
[01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:43.670]  I was just like, the only person I know who I could send that to
[01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:45.290]  and have a great conversation about.
[01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:47.570]  Of course Geoff Hardy would have shit
[01:03:47.570 --> 01:03:50.030]  internet. It just checks out on every level.
[01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:51.290]  I'll say that Eric is
[01:03:51.290 --> 01:03:53.770]  really good at sending me funny, hot
[01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:55.250]  takes during basketball games.
[01:03:55.630 --> 01:03:57.910]  Ooh. Game 4, or what?
[01:03:57.970 --> 01:03:59.390]  Yeah, 4. I can't count.
[01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:01.370]  We just did 4, right? No, it's 2-1.
[01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:03.150]  I'm sorry, I've been out of it.
[01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:04.150]  What the fuck is wrong with you?
[01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:07.630]  Game 4 of the series is coming up,
[01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:08.570]  and I just... yeah.
[01:04:10.090 --> 01:04:11.450]  I discounted Game 2.
[01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:13.450]  We're talking about the Celtics, Golden State Warriors
[01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:15.570]  in the finals. I couldn't believe they won
[01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:17.470]  Game 1. Game 2 I didn't really
[01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:19.590]  care about because I felt like there was no way
[01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:21.250]  they could win. I did care, but you know what I mean.
[01:04:21.350 --> 01:04:23.210]  No, it's a scheduled loss.
[01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:25.290]  Yeah, and the fact that they've won
[01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:27.410]  Game 3 now makes me think that they
[01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:29.490]  might actually win it all, so I'm very excited,
[01:04:29.650 --> 01:04:31.330]  but I also expect Game 4 to be a loss.
[01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:33.330]  It's ludicrous to think that the
[01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:35.670]  Boston Celtics are two wins
[01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:37.390]  away from being NBA champions.
[01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:39.510]  And we're not a basketball
[01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:41.390]  podcast. We're a baseball's...
[01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:43.250]  Actually, we're a baseball equipment podcast.
[01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:45.630]  So I guess it's like there's an affinity
[01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:47.490]  there, but I don't want to get too deep into sports
[01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:49.290]  because then everybody would be mad at us.
[01:04:50.730 --> 01:04:51.550]  Oh, you know what? We should
[01:04:51.550 --> 01:04:53.570]  probably end. Though, let me just tell you
[01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:55.430]  guys, I wish there was a funnier bit to it, but
[01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:56.810]  I got the new bike and it works great.
[01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:59.490]  Oh, that's so awesome.
[01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:01.350]  Is it the seat any better for you?
[01:05:01.350 --> 01:05:02.110]  No, it's the seat's worse.
[01:05:03.830 --> 01:05:05.230]  No, that's okay, that's okay.
[01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:07.430]  I just have to switch out. I'll probably
[01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:08.450]  have to make a few modifications.
[01:05:09.590 --> 01:05:11.450]  I'll probably have to change the seat and I might change
[01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:13.370]  the pedals out for the
[01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:14.850]  ones that I'm using now because they're grippier.
[01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:17.310]  But yeah, it's awesome.
[01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:19.450]  You know the shitty Instagram ads you get
[01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:21.410]  sometimes? It's like, hey, here's a box of goo.
[01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:23.530]  Put your foot in it and we'll send it back to us
[01:05:23.530 --> 01:05:25.350]  and we'll make your shoe custom. Is there one
[01:05:25.350 --> 01:05:27.490]  for your ass? Like you could just sit in a box
[01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:29.350]  and it molds your ass and they'll print you
[01:05:29.350 --> 01:05:30.690]  a bike seat?
[01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:33.150]  I would pay $1,000 for that.
[01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:35.430]  For custom...
[01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:36.570]  Tuxedo bike seat.
[01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:39.630]  You'd pay a pancake phone
[01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:40.270]  number money for that.
[01:05:42.330 --> 01:05:43.590]  Have you ever seen the movie
[01:05:43.590 --> 01:05:45.350]  Safe Men, Geoff? No.
[01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:47.410]  The character Sam Rockwell
[01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:49.370]  in it has a fake ass. Have you considered
[01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:51.370]  getting an ass just for riding
[01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:53.370]  your bike? Like an attachable
[01:05:53.370 --> 01:05:55.350]  ass? So I went...
[01:05:55.350 --> 01:05:57.490]  I thought about like an episode of King of the
[01:05:57.490 --> 01:05:59.390]  Hill when Hank was having trouble sitting in
[01:05:59.390 --> 01:06:01.270]  his truck and his riding lawn mower. It was
[01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:03.190]  hurting and it was because his butt wore away
[01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:04.710]  and he had to get like butt implants.
[01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:07.210]  And I was like, shit, maybe I wore my
[01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:08.990]  butt off and I need to go get butt implants.
[01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:10.790]  So I went to the doctor and the doctor was like
[01:06:11.350 --> 01:06:12.350]  you're a fucking idiot.
[01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:15.150]  I was like, alright. This is why I don't
[01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:15.710]  go to the doctor.
[01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:19.010]  You see those time lapses in wildlife where
[01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:20.770]  a river will slowly erode rock.
[01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:23.250]  It just time lapsed your ass as it got smaller.
[01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:25.270]  Hey, I
[01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:26.870]  gotta go get the door real fast.
[01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:27.550]  Be just a second.
[01:06:28.290 --> 01:06:30.090]  I feel like it's already ended.
[01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:32.010]  Why would you just, yeah, just wrap up
[01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:33.410]  the podcast. Thank you so much.
[01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:36.030]  Now that Geoff's gone, that has reduced the amount
[01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:38.250]  of people in this to pleasantries
[01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:40.210]  amount. So you could just finish your pleasantries
[01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:40.590]  with Nick.
[01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:44.110]  I felt like, no, you don't
[01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:46.130]  as somebody who's not part of pleasantries, that's not
[01:06:46.130 --> 01:06:48.170]  how pleasantries work. I thought it works when you're
[01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:49.570]  not recording and there's not everyone here.
[01:06:49.850 --> 01:06:52.170]  No, it's before it starts. The pleasantries
[01:06:52.170 --> 01:06:54.470]  lead into the show. The purpose of the pleasantries
[01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:55.970]  is that
[01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:58.150]  you have a conversation, you calm down,
[01:06:58.150 --> 01:07:00.290]  you have some laughs, and then you go into the thing.
[01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:02.210]  Pleasantries are
[01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:03.950]  great. I'm back.
[01:07:04.570 --> 01:07:05.830]  Continue with your pleasantries talk.
[01:07:06.050 --> 01:07:08.250]  Sorry, I had to get medicine for Emily. Andrew doesn't
[01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:09.010]  want to do pleasantries.
[01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:12.330]  Well, it's not pleasantries. You can't have pleasantries
[01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:14.170]  at the end of a show. Well, but you guys
[01:07:14.170 --> 01:07:16.470]  do that. That's not pleasantries.
[01:07:16.790 --> 01:07:17.810]  What is it, post trees?
[01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:19.110]  It's post trees.
[01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:22.230]  You guys do post trees, like the two
[01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:24.190]  of you, for hours, to the point where I thought you were doing
[01:07:24.970 --> 01:07:25.990]  a secret podcast.
[01:07:27.690 --> 01:07:28.570]  Like you guys
[01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:31.030]  were doing like a post show, where you just make fun of Geoff for an hour.
[01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:33.390]  I don't know how that...
[01:07:33.390 --> 01:07:34.630]  I think that started because
[01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:36.730]  my computer is so shit, it takes
[01:07:36.730 --> 01:07:38.630]  like 12 minutes for me to export.
[01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:40.770]  And everybody leaves, so I'm just sitting
[01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:42.650]  in the channel by myself, and Gavin was like,
[01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:44.410]  what's going on in here?
[01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:46.670]  And then it just became a tradition, that Gavin
[01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:48.670]  comes back in as I'm exporting. We have a little talk.
[01:07:48.810 --> 01:07:50.690]  Yeah, I'd say every single recording
[01:07:50.690 --> 01:07:51.990]  we have a five minute...
[01:07:53.030 --> 01:07:54.630]  well, apparently it's not pleasant, but
[01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:56.270]  it's some sort of conversation, and then I leave.
[01:07:56.270 --> 01:07:58.490]  It's definitely pleasant, it's just not a pleasant tree.
[01:07:58.690 --> 01:07:59.650]  It's not pleasant trees.
[01:07:59.770 --> 01:08:02.530]  I really... I think that's kind of...
[01:08:02.530 --> 01:08:03.650]  I think that's bullshit, dude.
[01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:04.830]  I think it's pleasant trees, too.
[01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:08.530]  I don't think pleasant trees is
[01:08:08.530 --> 01:08:10.730]  dictated by when in the conversation
[01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:11.670]  it happens.
[01:08:11.970 --> 01:08:14.530]  I think by definition of the spirit of the show,
[01:08:14.610 --> 01:08:16.370]  pleasant trees is before the podcast starts.
[01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:18.330]  I think we have a hundred plus episodes where that
[01:08:18.330 --> 01:08:20.550]  sets when the time is. Maybe not pleasant trees
[01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:22.110]  in the outside world. What if there's a regulation
[01:08:22.110 --> 01:08:24.130]  pleasant trees, and what we have afterwards is
[01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:26.190]  deregulated pleasant trees. Can I say something
[01:08:26.190 --> 01:08:28.410]  I learned recently? Not all pleasant trees are alike.
[01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:30.130]  You gotta be very selective
[01:08:30.130 --> 01:08:32.330]  with your pleasant trees. You should talk about that.
[01:08:33.130 --> 01:08:33.610]  That's...
[01:08:33.610 --> 01:08:36.170]  There are... sometimes you go into meetings
[01:08:36.170 --> 01:08:37.890]  and pleasant trees can be
[01:08:37.890 --> 01:08:38.610]  disastrous.
[01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:42.130]  I had a fun
[01:08:42.130 --> 01:08:43.430]  meeting with you guys that day.
[01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:45.810]  That was a great meeting.
[01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:48.090]  I was around new
[01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:49.750]  people. I'm a social mess.
[01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:51.890]  Oh, it was awkward. I fucked it up
[01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:53.710]  so good. Listening to Andrew try and have
[01:08:53.710 --> 01:08:55.690]  pleasant trees with two people he'd never met or
[01:08:55.690 --> 01:08:57.610]  spoken to before, and like
[01:08:57.610 --> 01:08:59.470]  trying to feel them out, it was...
[01:08:59.470 --> 01:09:01.170]  Oh, it was so funny. I wish it was being recorded.
[01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:03.690]  It was so awkward. You were trying so hard.
[01:09:03.770 --> 01:09:05.810]  You were really pulling... you were doing all the work.
[01:09:06.170 --> 01:09:07.870]  You can say a lot about me. I do try
[01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:09.750]  hard. That is a consistent...
[01:09:10.930 --> 01:09:13.750]  I will say, one thing I've learned...
[01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:15.850]  Outside of the context of F***face
[01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:17.710]  where I do everything a little differently,
[01:09:17.710 --> 01:09:19.650]  I show up for every
[01:09:19.650 --> 01:09:21.470]  work-related meeting three minutes late.
[01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:23.910]  So I can avoid pleasantries. It's a good way to go.
[01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:25.750]  It's something I've...
[01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:27.870]  It is a different animal outside of this
[01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:29.410]  podcast. Pleasantries.
[01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:31.690]  It is. Yes, I learned that the hard way.
[01:09:31.930 --> 01:09:33.530]  What did you think of my input?
[01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:35.050]  Nick says, you want me to cut that?
[01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.470]  No.
[01:09:38.530 --> 01:09:39.550]  Oh, Geoff's thing.
[01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:41.590]  Not my thing. Showing up three minutes late
[01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:42.650]  so I don't have to do pleasantries?
[01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:45.050]  No, I don't think that's a rude thing.
[01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:47.090]  Nah, I just pretend to be coming in late from another
[01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:48.650]  meeting. They don't know.
[01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:53.030]  I like the idea that you're just sat at your desk, and then right before
[01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:54.910]  the meeting starts, or right before you join,
[01:09:54.970 --> 01:09:57.010]  you just run like five laps around your chair, and you're like,
[01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:59.050]  Hey guys, sorry, I just come in hot off
[01:09:59.050 --> 01:09:59.650]  this other thing.
[01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:03.050]  Every meeting, you start
[01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:04.330]  on the phone with somebody else.
[01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:07.210]  You join the meeting, and then you're just on a fake call
[01:10:07.210 --> 01:10:09.130]  every time. Also, Nick is like,
[01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:10.930]  now they know. Here's the deal, Nick.
[01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:13.070]  No, they don't. No one in
[01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:14.650]  our company listens to this podcast.
[01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:17.230]  The amount of conversations I have to have where I explain
[01:10:17.230 --> 01:10:18.970]  the most basic shit about F*** Face
[01:10:18.970 --> 01:10:20.830]  to people is ludicrous.
[01:10:20.970 --> 01:10:22.710]  There's no way I could
[01:10:22.710 --> 01:10:24.930]  say anything I wanted to on this podcast,
[01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:26.990]  and it wouldn't matter in the context
[01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:29.250]  of the people that we work with, because they would never,
[01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:31.370]  ever, even on accident,
[01:10:31.530 --> 01:10:33.050]  hear it. I've seen you explain
[01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:34.990]  to people at the company what works
[01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:37.130]  about F*** Face, and then you'll go into a meeting
[01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:39.030]  a month later and explain the thing you
[01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:40.490]  were talking about, and they'll be like, Ooh, what's that?
[01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:42.310]  It's like, no one can
[01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:44.270]  bring themselves to delve in.
[01:10:44.890 --> 01:10:45.990]  It's just like... It's a lot.
[01:10:46.210 --> 01:10:48.630]  It's a deep lure about nothing. It's the F*** Face curse
[01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:50.350]  that it's not just the podcast,
[01:10:50.650 --> 01:10:52.510]  it extends to conversations and meetings
[01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:54.230]  too, where it's like as soon as the meeting about the
[01:10:54.230 --> 01:10:56.130]  F*** Face thing is over, everybody
[01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:58.390]  else from every other department
[01:10:58.390 --> 01:11:00.390]  in the company, their brain toilet flushes too,
[01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:01.650]  and they're like, f***ing tell me that.
[01:11:06.650 --> 01:11:08.590]  I have been enjoying the weekly newsletter
[01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:10.450]  that's been coming out, the internal
[01:11:10.450 --> 01:11:12.770]  one that has to say that Anal Passage
[01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:14.230]  is the top seller of everything.
[01:11:15.670 --> 01:11:16.590]  Because you know
[01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:18.150]  there's everyone at the company just thinking,
[01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:20.470]  I don't even want to look up what that
[01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:22.430]  could be about. Dude, I don't want to get too
[01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:24.250]  granular into sales and stuff,
[01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:26.790]  but let me just say that
[01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:28.170]  the F*** Face
[01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:30.390]  annual Anal Passage shirt
[01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:32.410]  is... it's nearing four figures
[01:11:32.410 --> 01:11:34.630]  in sales, which is absolutely
[01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:35.290]  ludicrous.
[01:11:35.850 --> 01:11:36.850]  It's so stupid.
[01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:39.650]  I can't f***ing believe it.
[01:11:39.970 --> 01:11:40.870]  I can't believe that in
[01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:43.450]  nineteen and a half years of selling T-shirts
[01:11:43.450 --> 01:11:45.250]  online, through
[01:11:45.250 --> 01:11:46.250]  various productions,
[01:11:47.690 --> 01:11:49.290]  Anal Passage is approaching
[01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:50.990]  top fifty
[01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:53.350]  for the history of the company at some point,
[01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:55.350]  I think. It's f***ing ridiculous.
[01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:57.510]  Wow. I love it. That's awesome.
[01:11:57.710 --> 01:11:59.490]  That also may not be true, it's just going off
[01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:01.350]  the top of my head. No, that's great.
[01:12:01.570 --> 01:12:02.610]  Let's just claim it's true.
[01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:03.830]  That's fantastic.
[01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:06.390]  It's like Bow Chicka Bow Wow,
[01:12:06.610 --> 01:12:08.590]  Camping is a Legitimate Strategy,
[01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:10.510]  Zombie Plan,
[01:12:10.850 --> 01:12:12.530]  The Caboose Shirt, and
[01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:13.550]  Anal Passage.
[01:12:17.610 --> 01:12:18.730]  That's a great lie.
[01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:19.790]  Even if it's not true,
[01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:22.330]  it's important to have good lies.
[01:12:22.450 --> 01:12:23.970]  I was talking to a friend recently,
[01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:26.710]  and they were in this dance competition
[01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:28.050]  that was like every school
[01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:29.830]  in this area
[01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:30.770]  competed.
[01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:33.530]  They only read out the top ten
[01:12:34.090 --> 01:12:35.390]  names of the thing.
[01:12:35.970 --> 01:12:37.590]  So one of the kids, as a lie, said
[01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:38.550]  they placed eleventh.
[01:12:39.010 --> 01:12:41.830]  They only read ten. Nobody knows.
[01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:43.590]  I don't think they even ranked ten.
[01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:45.590]  But almost everybody in the group
[01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:47.790]  believed that they came eleventh. They genuinely thought
[01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:49.550]  that, and it got printed in the newsletter.
[01:12:50.170 --> 01:12:51.650]  And there are kids who lived like twenty
[01:12:51.650 --> 01:12:53.670]  years of their lives thinking they
[01:12:53.670 --> 01:12:55.770]  placed eleventh in the finals of this dance
[01:12:55.770 --> 01:12:57.490]  competition. It's like complete
[01:12:57.490 --> 01:12:59.410]  bullshit. So even if the
[01:12:59.410 --> 01:13:01.530]  Anal Passage shirt isn't in the
[01:13:01.530 --> 01:13:03.650]  top whatever you said, it's a great lie.
[01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:04.830]  Let's just go with that.
[01:13:06.210 --> 01:13:07.590]  We should probably wrap up though.
[01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:09.730]  This has gone on way longer
[01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:11.490]  than it's supposed to. Yeah, Nick tried
[01:13:11.490 --> 01:13:13.530]  to end it several times. I was trying to cut
[01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:15.210]  it off at like the forty minute mark, but
[01:13:15.210 --> 01:13:16.390]  it just kept going.
[01:13:17.770 --> 01:13:18.850]  After the double trouble.
[01:13:19.190 --> 01:13:20.050]  After the double trouble.
[01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:25.070]  I gotta say, I don't know what it is,
[01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:27.210]  but the last two episodes
[01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:28.590]  we've recorded after I've
[01:13:29.170 --> 01:13:30.470]  just felt really, really good
[01:13:31.050 --> 01:13:33.070]  about until I listened to that one, episode 106.
[01:13:33.230 --> 01:13:35.210]  So I'll continue to feel good about 107 because I'll never
[01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:37.110]  hear it. But I feel like this one
[01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:38.990]  was pretty good too. I've been enjoying
[01:13:40.090 --> 01:13:40.750]  this little
[01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:42.510]  phase of the podcast that we're in.
[01:13:42.930 --> 01:13:45.050]  What is this phase? It's not really driven by
[01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:47.130]  a specific thing, it's just sort of a
[01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:49.110]  intermediary phase.
[01:13:49.730 --> 01:13:51.390]  Yeah, just kind of relaxed,
[01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:52.730]  just catching up with each other.
[01:13:52.730 --> 01:13:53.770]  There's a very genuine
[01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:56.610]  appreciation. It's almost like a
[01:13:57.310 --> 01:13:58.270]  mid-season,
[01:13:58.470 --> 01:14:00.730]  mid-episode pleasantries. That's a great way
[01:14:00.730 --> 01:14:02.890]  to put it. This does feel mid-season, mid-episode
[01:14:02.890 --> 01:14:04.750]  pleasantries. I'm really excited to
[01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:06.870]  find out what constitutes a switch of volumes.
[01:14:07.330 --> 01:14:07.950]  Uh, yeah.
[01:14:08.250 --> 01:14:09.610]  You and me both.
[01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:12.610]  That could be like a decade long volume 1.
[01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:14.830]  I've just been... What season are we in?
[01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:16.490]  We're in season 4. I've just been
[01:14:16.490 --> 01:14:18.450]  throwing volume 1 out to
[01:14:18.450 --> 01:14:19.570]  extend the title.
[01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:21.130]  Uh...
[01:14:21.130 --> 01:14:23.630]  I do assume there will be a volume
[01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:25.790]  2 at some point. And as soon as that happens,
[01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:27.590]  we'll do volume 2 for a while and then it
[01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:29.590]  will be revealed that it's like chapter 1.
[01:14:29.850 --> 01:14:31.910]  Or something. Cause we'll still be in 1 of something.
[01:14:32.970 --> 01:14:33.610]  Edition 1.
[01:14:37.290 --> 01:14:39.830]  Alright, let's stop talking to each other. Well, except for you two.
[01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:41.750]  You guys will continue to talk for a brief period
[01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:43.330]  of time. I'm gonna stop talking to you guys.
[01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:45.630]  And Geoff, I won't see you in Vegas. Gavin,
[01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:46.690]  I won't see you this weekend.
[01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:48.810]  But I hope you have a great
[01:14:48.810 --> 01:14:50.810]  time. I assume that because we're not
[01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:52.670]  spending time together in Austin
[01:14:52.670 --> 01:14:54.450]  or anywhere else, the weather will be lovely.
[01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:56.410]  And you'll be able to swim and
[01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:58.730]  get some sun. It's like 42 degrees this weekend.
[01:14:59.090 --> 01:15:00.570]  Yeah, eat some barbecue
[01:15:00.570 --> 01:15:02.770]  and do whatever it is you do, buddy. And Andrew,
[01:15:03.450 --> 01:15:04.870]  I hope Canada is pleasant.
[01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:06.430]  Thank you.
[01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:08.750]  Okay. I'm actually gonna be
[01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:10.750]  in Vegas next weekend. Are you gonna be in Vegas
[01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:12.110]  next weekend? Yeah, I am.
[01:15:12.930 --> 01:15:14.210]  I'm not even... What?
[01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:16.470]  I'm in Vegas next weekend.
[01:15:16.890 --> 01:15:18.070]  What? In June?
[01:15:18.330 --> 01:15:19.330]  Family trip. Yeah.
[01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:21.890]  It's a family trip. You're a liar.
[01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:24.290]  You're a fucking liar. No, I'm not lying.
[01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:25.410]  You're a liar? Are you serious?
[01:15:25.410 --> 01:15:26.990]  You are such a little fucking liar.
[01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:29.930]  You said you were going to America!
[01:15:30.210 --> 01:15:31.370]  You wouldn't step foot in America!
[01:15:31.730 --> 01:15:34.070]  It's too soon! It wasn't
[01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:35.630]  my choice, okay?
[01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:38.190]  It was a family trip that I didn't plan.
[01:15:38.890 --> 01:15:40.010]  What do you mean?
[01:15:40.090 --> 01:15:42.230]  In the same month that we wanted you to go to
[01:15:42.230 --> 01:15:44.290]  Vegas? It's complicated,
[01:15:44.450 --> 01:15:46.330]  okay? On my birthday weekend?
[01:15:46.570 --> 01:15:48.310]  The week after Gavin and I were supposed
[01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:50.350]  to go to Vegas? We could have planned a big weekend
[01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:52.250]  together! We could have hung out with your
[01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:54.350]  mom! I don't believe it. I think he's
[01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:56.250]  lying. No, I'm gonna be there for a week.
[01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:57.810]  You're not... What?
[01:15:57.810 --> 01:15:59.950]  June 20th. I leave June 20th.
[01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:02.050]  Probably need to schedule with Eric
[01:16:02.530 --> 01:16:03.950]  about recording, maybe. I don't know.
[01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:06.230]  What?
[01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:08.350]  I don't even... Sorry.
[01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:09.970]  I didn't plan for it.
[01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:11.830]  I don't even know what to say to this.
[01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:14.050]  I was excited. Who goes to Vegas for a
[01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:16.130]  week? It was a whole thing
[01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:17.950]  with, like, apparently the tickets were
[01:16:18.990 --> 01:16:20.050]  cheaper if we
[01:16:20.050 --> 01:16:21.750]  came back on a different day.
[01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:23.990]  The tickets, if we went with us, would have been free!
[01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:25.810]  Well, I didn't plan this.
[01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:27.450]  As I said, I'm just going on this trip.
[01:16:29.670 --> 01:16:31.190]  I was really excited.
[01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:34.050]  I thought, oh, we might all be in Vegas
[01:16:34.050 --> 01:16:35.350]  at the same time, coincidentally.
[01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:36.790]  That would have been time.
[01:16:37.670 --> 01:16:38.410]  Well, that
[01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:40.550]  sucked all my good feeling out of the
[01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:42.750]  mid-season, mid-episode
[01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:44.710]  pleasantries. I'm just kidding! I'm not going to Vegas
[01:16:44.710 --> 01:16:46.510]  making that up. I'm just kidding.
[01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:47.370]  That wasn't real.
[01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:49.610]  I'm just joking.
[01:16:51.330 --> 01:16:52.990]  We might need to reschedule next week.
[01:16:53.090 --> 01:16:53.910]  That was a kidding!
[01:16:57.150 --> 01:16:58.130]  Alright, well,
[01:16:59.590 --> 01:17:00.850]  somebody's gotta end this, so let's
[01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:02.290]  stop doing this.
[01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:04.290]  Thanks for listening!
[01:17:04.290 --> 01:17:05.550]  Yeah, thanks for listening!
[01:17:05.850 --> 01:17:08.250]  Like, and review, and subscribe, and tell a friend!
[01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:10.130]  Tell two friends! Tell an acquaintance!
[01:17:10.230 --> 01:17:12.290]  Tell a teacher! Tell a parental
[01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:14.270]  figure! Maybe tell a
[01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:16.490]  boss! Tell an employee! Tell a
[01:17:17.150 --> 01:17:18.030]  retail worker!
[01:17:18.270 --> 01:17:20.250]  Brighten their day! If you go to an
[01:17:20.250 --> 01:17:22.370]  airport anytime soon, be sure to tell the stewardess
[01:17:22.370 --> 01:17:24.210]  and the flight attendant, I think
[01:17:24.210 --> 01:17:25.390]  as they're referred to now.
[01:17:26.210 --> 01:17:28.270]  If you go to McDonald's, maybe
[01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:29.630]  you see somebody with a shake?
[01:17:30.010 --> 01:17:32.230]  Hey, they're lucky. The shake machine's always broken.
[01:17:32.230 --> 01:17:34.330]  But tell them, hey, listen to
[01:17:34.330 --> 01:17:36.390]  F*** Face. They talk about shakes sometimes.
[01:17:37.570 --> 01:17:38.290]  And, oh!
[01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:40.430]  If you're a dog lover, tell somebody
[01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:42.090]  about F*** Face. I don't know why.
[01:17:42.690 --> 01:17:44.410]  We'll see you next week. In all seriousness,
[01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:46.030]  I'm definitely not maybe going to Vegas.
[01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:47.790]  Dude, you are
[01:17:47.790 --> 01:17:50.450]  f***ing shit. He's going to f***ing Vegas.
[01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:52.790]  Hey guys, Major League Fan
[01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:54.390]  Jack here with a look at next week's
[01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:55.690]  episode of F*** Face.
[01:17:56.090 --> 01:17:58.250]  Geoff has a new metal roof. The gang
[01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:00.350]  hits up eBay. The billionaires need
[01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:02.370]  help too. What is the safest
[01:18:02.370 --> 01:18:04.350]  mode of transportation? Geoff is
[01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:06.510]  a big Explorers fan. Gavin flips
[01:18:06.510 --> 01:18:08.250]  a coin. And once again,
[01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:09.850]  Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:18:10.230 --> 01:18:12.170]  All that and more on next week's episode of
[01:18:12.170 --> 01:18:12.710]  F*** Face.
