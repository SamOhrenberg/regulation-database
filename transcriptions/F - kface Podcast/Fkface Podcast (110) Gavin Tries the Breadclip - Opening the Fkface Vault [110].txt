[00:15.100 --> 00:15.440]  I
[00:15.440 --> 00:18.740]  Guess I should say I got the bread to put the work and now I've lost the bread
[00:20.960 --> 00:26.120]  It's very small it's a very small thing I keep losing it I got it to
[00:27.120 --> 00:31.240]  No, I didn't throw it away. Eric asked did I throw it away? I didn't throw it away. I tightly
[00:32.240 --> 00:37.420]  wound up a bag that had two bagels in it and I was like this could hold it and I got it to the
[00:37.420 --> 00:40.380]  Point where it did prevent it from opening the bag
[00:41.580 --> 00:46.320]  Then I took a bagel out and I put on my desk and then I moved it somewhere from that
[00:46.320 --> 00:50.600]  I don't it's somewhere on my desk. I think but it's very small. You pinned it in you. It's tough to find
[00:50.600 --> 00:56.100]  I definitely did not bin it. Well, I've got the bread clip hit. What episode is this by the way?
[00:56.420 --> 00:59.160]  All right. Hold on a second. I'll do that. Hello and welcome to the
[01:00.860 --> 01:02.280]  110th episode of the
[01:02.980 --> 01:09.620]  Face podcast. My name is Geoff Ramsey with me as always Andrew Panton and Gavin free
[01:10.600 --> 01:16.560]  Once from England ones from Canada doesn't matter which I'm from America and Gavin you're gonna try an experiment
[01:16.560 --> 01:22.240]  I think I was supposed to do this in 108 and I forgot but I now have the bread clip and some bread
[01:22.240 --> 01:27.560]  So how did I first off? How does it feel like let's give it give it give us some some audio texture
[01:27.560 --> 01:31.100]  How does it feel in your hand? What is it sturdy? Do you like the magnet?
[01:31.220 --> 01:37.700]  Well, the first thing I've noticed is that it's made of metal, but that bit isn't magnetic. It has a separate magnet on it
[01:37.700 --> 01:44.160]  A little magnet on it sort of defeats the whole purpose in a way, but all right got some bread
[01:44.880 --> 01:48.680]  Gonna try now cuz in my head this was this there's no way I wasn't gonna get this on here
[01:48.680 --> 01:52.640]  But here we go. Let's try. Yeah, I know I was the same and then I got a loaf and it's really difficult
[01:52.640 --> 01:56.880]  You need to really wind it tight. You need to make the top narrow and you need to slide it up
[01:56.880 --> 02:00.760]  There's no putting it through the front. You got to slide it in the hole
[02:02.800 --> 02:04.460]  It's a slide mechanism
[02:05.660 --> 02:10.400]  What what wait, is it a full loaf of bread that you're trying to do how much bread is in this bag?
[02:10.860 --> 02:13.020]  I'm just I'm not using the bread bit
[02:13.520 --> 02:14.500]  Using the bag
[02:15.740 --> 02:21.340]  What do you mean what is it just an empty bag? No, it's got like the nubs on the end. You've just fucking
[02:22.100 --> 02:25.820]  Wait, that's what I'm asking. I'm asking how much of the loaf is in the bag
[02:25.820 --> 02:27.600]  Why does it matter?
[02:28.200 --> 02:29.480]  Because it's a weight
[02:30.140 --> 02:34.620]  Neck, it's a weight differential for the bag and the maneuverability of it
[02:34.620 --> 02:38.480]  It's a full loaf. You don't have the same maneuverability in the bag. I've done this before
[02:38.480 --> 02:43.420]  Have you done this Geoff? Have you tried this? Yes. Okay. Well, I didn't know that. Okay
[02:44.100 --> 02:50.640]  Oh, I don't even remember that but I the bagels work because there was a less volume I'd say in the bag itself
[02:50.640 --> 02:55.280]  It allowed more manipulation and flattening of the bag to get it through this blows
[02:56.100 --> 02:56.540]  Yes
[02:57.360 --> 03:05.000]  Listen, it's a prototype. It's early. It's it's version one things that we solved a it's pretty it's very aesthetic
[03:05.000 --> 03:09.120]  So got a it's a it's a it's a beautiful sky blue. It's got cool
[03:09.800 --> 03:14.460]  Date on it says our name. That's cool. Nailed it out of the park first try right there. Got it
[03:14.460 --> 03:20.300]  It's got a magnet on it sticks to metal stuff. Boom nailed that feels sturdy
[03:21.220 --> 03:23.240]  Nailed it doesn't bend
[03:24.280 --> 03:25.560]  Absolutely nailed that
[03:25.560 --> 03:31.040]  Unfortunately, that's where it starts to fall apart turns out should have bent a little bit. No worries
[03:31.040 --> 03:37.360]  We'll work on that for revision to what you have right now though in version one is a great commemorative blip
[03:38.120 --> 03:43.620]  Much like when people buy commemorative spoons and thimbles, they don't really use them to sew and eat soup
[03:43.620 --> 03:46.960]  They hang them on the wall. God my mouth has I just fucking this
[03:48.660 --> 03:52.740]  You're struggling yeah, it's just like I feel like my mouth's full of saliva all the time
[03:53.240 --> 03:57.560]  okay, so I I ripped the bag and the man the magnet flew off and um,
[03:58.240 --> 03:59.540]  Megan's gonna I've just got the
[04:01.200 --> 04:02.540]  The blue bit it's tough
[04:03.880 --> 04:06.620]  I'm gonna put on a chain and wear it. I think that's how I'm gonna use it
[04:06.620 --> 04:07.000]  well
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.100]  I think what you could do honestly you put it on a chain and then you have like a
[04:11.100 --> 04:15.920]  Singular bagel in a bag and you run that through the hole and then you have the bag supporting the bag
[04:15.920 --> 04:22.320]  So it's like a double chain situation. That would be the luck have like one slice of bread in a bag being held up by your chain
[04:23.360 --> 04:29.620]  Just in case you never know when you could use a slice or a bag man. I wonder how many of these we bought
[04:29.620 --> 04:33.260]  I have no idea how many the store have people buying it. I don't know
[04:33.260 --> 04:35.540]  Yeah, I mean they probably are
[04:36.440 --> 04:39.920]  They're definitely out by the time people hear this but not not when we're recording this
[04:40.760 --> 04:43.200]  Can I can I give an important update?
[04:43.260 --> 04:47.000]  I meant to give last time that is brought it is genuine the joy doesn't end
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.400]  It just keeps on going with the whole Jake tunes
[04:49.900 --> 04:51.340]  Tums thing. Yeah
[04:51.340 --> 04:57.760]  So I recorded a thing and I need to like edit it down and chop it a little bit of him learning because after we
[04:57.760 --> 05:04.120]  Recorded I talked to him in a group and he he learned that he's been saying Tums wrong his entire life
[05:04.120 --> 05:05.520]  And he was not happy about it
[05:05.520 --> 05:11.380]  And it was a big discussion of like we are sacrificing the fact that we can hear him say tombs
[05:11.380 --> 05:13.880]  And it is fucking hilarious every time he says it
[05:14.760 --> 05:21.860]  So there's sort of a sense of loss the fact that we had lost tombs, I'm not exaggerating the exact same night
[05:21.860 --> 05:27.720]  He was we're talking. He's like, you know, what's funny is I don't even typically use like Tom's that type of thing
[05:27.720 --> 05:33.740]  I'm more like I'm in the Rolaids camp, you know Rolaids like the watch and there was a pause
[05:34.540 --> 05:42.320]  Long silent pause and they're like, excuse me. He said Rolaids like the watch and we're like does that on the packaging?
[05:42.320 --> 05:47.000]  Did you come up with that? And he said no, this is a Jake original for you
[05:47.000 --> 05:52.760]  And he genuinely we lost Tums and tombs. Jake thinks Rolexes are called Rolaids
[05:52.760 --> 05:56.680]  And it's been the new thing that has taken the last week
[05:56.680 --> 06:00.220]  He went to a wedding and I was like, oh you see anybody open any gifts?
[06:00.340 --> 06:04.380]  He's like nah, I didn't see it. I was like, oh, so you didn't see anyone get a Rolaid and he said nope
[06:04.380 --> 06:10.380]  Didn't see it. I was like does your dad have a Rolaid Jake? He's like, I don't know. He might I'm not sure
[06:10.380 --> 06:17.860]  He genuinely thinks this so it's just an endless treasure cove of of words that are slightly wrong
[06:17.860 --> 06:23.480]  I mean at least with tombs you could have just misread the word. Yeah. How do you get Rolaid?
[06:23.800 --> 06:26.800]  I have no idea and I'm not he's not doing a bit
[06:26.800 --> 06:31.640]  He just genuinely thinks that Rolaids is Rolex and it's great
[06:31.640 --> 06:37.560]  It's been getting him and it's so much easier to prompt him to do the Rolaid Rolex thing. It's fantastic
[06:38.080 --> 06:40.140]  Gavin disposed to the photo that
[06:40.140 --> 06:47.540]  Looks ridiculous. That looks good. I think that looks good. I like that. I think that's I think that's going on
[06:47.540 --> 06:54.260]  That's fashion right there. I'm a chain guy. What is the thing on your is that the skateboard from Tony Hawk ride?
[06:54.420 --> 06:56.240]  What is that thing on your floor?
[06:56.500 --> 07:02.800]  Is that a foot bench? No, it's just something to stand on like a little rocker when the desk is in stand mode
[07:03.620 --> 07:08.220]  Well, you have a thing you have a thing to stand on when it you're standing for your desk
[07:08.720 --> 07:12.760]  Yeah, I just came with a desk. I don't know why I don't know if it's good for you or anything
[07:12.760 --> 07:16.920]  Oh, I just stand on it and it's like a balance. I don't know.
[07:17.500 --> 07:22.860]  I feel like that defeats the purpose of the standing. I'm still standing. I'm just standing on something. That's not the floor
[07:22.860 --> 07:23.360]  Yeah
[07:23.360 --> 07:28.480]  But I feel like the whole thing of you stand because you don't want to sit and you're like avoiding a mechanism
[07:28.480 --> 07:32.780]  It would defeat the purpose of the standing desk if I raised it as high as it could go and then sat in a
[07:32.780 --> 07:36.220]  lifeguard chair, I think that'd be pointless, but I think this is still funny.
[07:36.760 --> 07:41.980]  You're just getting a good view. You're making sure nobody's sneaking up on you. No snake is gonna get you in the lifeguard chair.
[07:44.760 --> 07:46.940]  That's a real throwback. It is.
[07:47.520 --> 07:53.120]  Are you gonna wear that? Like is that is this genuinely part of your wardrobe now? Can people- I mean, I'm wearing it now
[07:53.120 --> 07:58.840]  I don't know how long it'll stay on. I typically find it really annoying to wear jewelry. Even a watch is annoying
[07:59.520 --> 08:05.140]  What is there any exception to your jewelry? I mean, I'd wear a Rolaid, but that's about it. Yeah, Rolaid?
[08:05.660 --> 08:11.160]  I looked, I googled to see if there's maybe a like a commitment of Rolaid's watch or something. They never made that. It doesn't matter.
[08:11.960 --> 08:15.720]  Tragic. Oh, I'd love to to get Jake a Rolaid's watch
[08:16.220 --> 08:23.080]  Did you see what Papa John's did? Eric and Gavin? I was gonna say. I'm so used to talking like dumb food shit with Eric
[08:23.080 --> 08:28.020]  I instinctually said somebody sent this to me right before we recorded
[08:28.020 --> 08:32.500]  It's a fucking monstrosity. Maybe you'll defend it. I
[08:32.500 --> 08:35.600]  fucking hate it. Papa John's is doing a
[08:36.420 --> 08:40.340]  Branston pickling cheese stuffed crust. No. In the US?
[08:40.960 --> 08:48.300]  No, I'm assuming this is in Europe. In the fucking US? You think in the US? You think they're fucking brave enough to do that in the US?
[08:49.240 --> 08:58.000]  Also, I need to clarify. Is Papa John's in Europe or is it just coincidentally another pizza chain named Papa John's that has nothing to do
[08:58.020 --> 09:01.280]  After Dennis the Menace, I don't know what to believe. Is that the same logo?
[09:03.340 --> 09:09.020]  Not really. Dude, Branston's been around for a hundred years, look. Has it? Well, it says it's
[09:09.780 --> 09:16.460]  1922. Fucking gross. It's terrible. Is it to celebrate the hundredth of a century of Branston Pickle?
[09:17.800 --> 09:24.220]  I love the idea that Papa John was the one. It's like we need to... I need to eat this. That sounds
[09:24.980 --> 09:30.360]  Absolutely phenomenal. I would... Horrible. Wow, Papa John's is
[09:31.020 --> 09:38.480]  everywhere. That doesn't surprise me. Isn't... Is Shaq Papa John now? Because Papa John sucked and got kicked out of Papa John's.
[09:38.680 --> 09:43.740]  Yeah, I think he's on the board or something, right? He's like a bunch of chain restaurants, I believe, of theirs.
[09:44.060 --> 09:45.280]  Yeah, he's a
[09:45.840 --> 09:52.740]  Savvy businessman, Shaquille O'Neal. I've never looked at a crust and thought this needs pickle. Like it's just such a terrible...
[09:52.740 --> 09:59.260]  But it's not pickle. It's fucking onion, right? No, it's... Isn't it pickle? I mean, I've... It's pickle.
[09:59.420 --> 10:02.900]  It's like mainly pickled onion. Well, I mean, you read the ingredients. It was like a bunch of different stuff.
[10:03.180 --> 10:05.200]  I don't even remember. I just remember not liking it.
[10:05.680 --> 10:08.180]  Oh, I think we should get... We should try and get you some of that and I want some too.
[10:08.720 --> 10:12.100]  How are... I don't think there's any way to get it. I assume it's only in Europe.
[10:12.220 --> 10:16.000]  Well, let's Google. I mean pizza travels well, but I don't know if it travels that well.
[10:17.320 --> 10:19.060]  We'd need someone to just take it on a plane.
[10:21.400 --> 10:26.860]  Illegally smuggled... You know, like in movies where like they tape the drugs or the money to them for like walking across.
[10:27.140 --> 10:32.320]  It's just pizza boxes. Yeah, where is that available? They also make Branson pickled cheese sticks.
[10:32.700 --> 10:39.020]  Oh, I'm just imagining somebody walking through the airport looking like a fucking Roblox character with like the boxes on each corner of them.
[10:39.120 --> 10:45.340]  Just a big blocky trying to be stealthy. What's this? Limited edition cheese sticks? Oh, it's the same thing.
[10:45.580 --> 10:47.080]  Yeah, it looks like it's only in the UK.
[10:48.340 --> 10:54.780]  Yeah, it's terrible. I'm gonna have to make a trip. Yeah, terrible. Anyone want to come? No, well, no.
[10:55.440 --> 11:02.380]  I thought for any reason, no. The answer is no. You will not set foot in the United Kingdom until...
[11:02.380 --> 11:10.280]  Until after November. There's an order. There's a wait list. I didn't go to Vegas. That was all. I was just kidding. That was a joke.
[11:10.280 --> 11:19.220]  I'm not in Vegas right now. Remember that? I was gonna be in Vegas. That was a whole, big whole hee-haw. Just kidding.
[11:19.560 --> 11:25.800]  Oh, man. I can't believe you wouldn't go to England with me. I would after November. I think that's pretty clear.
[11:26.160 --> 11:35.760]  So if an opportunity came up... After the Branson pickled cheese... Once it's long gone, I'll gladly, gladly do an England trip with you.
[11:35.760 --> 11:42.840]  I just don't want to set foot... Well, I don't want to be in the same place that there is a pickled crust. Sounds dangerous.
[11:43.180 --> 11:51.320]  We could make... How do you make a... Yeah, we could make this. No, we can't. No, we can't. No, we can't. We can't and we don't want to. We could.
[11:51.500 --> 12:00.120]  We could... It's possible. How would we make this? Have you ever made a crust in your life? No, I assume it's just rolling cheese into it, right?
[12:00.120 --> 12:09.980]  Yeah. Okay. Folding some cheese in? I guarantee you we could make this and it'd be perfect for Face Cooks the Food, the cookbook that we have never made.
[12:10.540 --> 12:19.360]  That's true. I think what we'll need is someone in England, if this is still on, someone just to rip the crust open and just give me a reference photo and then I'll try and make it.
[12:19.660 --> 12:25.740]  That's a great idea. I'd love to see that. I want to see your interpretation of it. And then I would go to Austin to eat it.
[12:25.740 --> 12:32.260]  Well, oh my God, Gavin. Gavin, this is the pizza you can cook in my pizza oven in my backyard so I can demo it.
[12:32.280 --> 12:39.020]  Is it? Oh, it's the circle. Oh my God, thank Christ. This weekend, Emily was like, is Gavin going to make a fucking pizza or what?
[12:39.040 --> 12:44.820]  And I was like, I don't know. I don't think so. And she goes, I'm paying to have this thing torn down, like tomorrow.
[12:44.820 --> 12:53.540]  No, keep it up until we make that pizza. Alright, so that's it. After you make the Branson pickle stuffed crust pizza, we're ripping that thing down so we can put a pool in.
[12:53.540 --> 12:58.560]  I just like the idea of pulling the pizza out and then the sledgehammers immediately start working.
[13:02.940 --> 13:08.180]  Oh, that's perfect. I think you should keep that. But I'm not gonna though. But that's perfect, dude. That's super exciting.
[13:08.560 --> 13:16.920]  In three years, I've made zero pizzas. Since we had the discussion in my backyard of you making a pizza in that thing, we've made zero pizzas.
[13:16.920 --> 13:25.460]  It clearly doesn't get used. However, this is a perfect way to use it. I could not be more excited.
[13:25.900 --> 13:32.800]  I would argue that you can go to a place to swim. You can't go to a place to make a pizza. I think the pizza oven is significantly more valuable.
[13:33.220 --> 13:42.740]  An authentic pizza oven experience? Obviously, people have ovens. Ovens can work, but I'm saying an authentic pizza oven experience? You can't just walk up and use that.
[13:43.140 --> 13:51.000]  I mean, I could just go to... there's like five wood-fired oven pizza restaurants like five blocks from me.
[13:51.280 --> 13:56.720]  Yeah, but you're not using them. What's it in the way of though? What's it in the way of? It takes up a lot of fucking space.
[13:57.160 --> 14:03.360]  But what are you gonna put there? Like a chair? You got chairs. I'm gonna put a pool there. Right there where the pizza thing is?
[14:03.560 --> 14:07.920]  Part of it, yeah, but the pool will cut into it a little bit. Yeah, probably. I would rework the shape of the pool.
[14:08.420 --> 14:16.400]  Also, we fucking tried to dig in your backyard before. We know what it's like. You're not gonna dig a pool there. You're gonna get three feet. There's no fucking way.
[14:16.520 --> 14:22.280]  I like that Andrew throws himself in this. We tried to dig a hole. Look, we are not gonna be digging a pool hole.
[14:23.120 --> 14:28.780]  A dude with a crane is gonna dig and a fucking earth mover is gonna be digging the pool hole. It's not gonna be us with shovels out there.
[14:28.900 --> 14:34.080]  You're gonna get a four-foot pool and one foot of it will be below ground. The rest will be sticking out. That's all it's gonna be.
[14:34.080 --> 14:44.260]  Yep. Also, if you get a fucking crane to dig up your yard, you better fucking try to cook beans in that hole. You better make a real goddamn hole with that bean.
[14:44.440 --> 14:51.420]  I don't want any goddamn excuses. A gavel with a hammer. Also, I don't think we ever released that video. I don't know if we ever will.
[14:51.580 --> 14:56.340]  But what a fucking... maybe my favorite video that has ever come out of this show. That and baseballs.
[14:56.580 --> 15:00.280]  What's that? The bean hole? Yeah, I don't think the bean hole video ever got released. I could be wrong.
[15:00.280 --> 15:08.400]  Are you serious? No, it's never come out. I put them in the folder like two months ago. Really? I was like, hey, I've got these videos done. Let me know if you want any changes.
[15:08.620 --> 15:13.660]  Wait, because the full baseball video never came out either. Yeah, it did. Did you do that as well? Oh, no, it didn't.
[15:13.720 --> 15:19.280]  Why do I do this work? Wait, they're available? I've been waiting. I've been waiting for you to be done. Yeah, me too. I didn't know they were done.
[15:19.280 --> 15:28.020]  I put it in the slack ages ago. I've never seen any of them. I'd love to. Gavin's overkill achievement came out and then before that it was Geoff at the plate reel and then Geoff at the plate.
[15:28.020 --> 15:34.120]  I wear my dick off on those. I'm so excited to see them. You didn't tell anyone. Yeah, this is going to be really exciting. Where can we find them?
[15:34.240 --> 15:41.400]  I thought they were out. Are you serious? I put them in the slack, you idiots. Why did you put them in the slack? There's no way you put them in the slack.
[15:42.460 --> 15:51.460]  How did we not... I don't remember you saying these are done. Like, I don't remember this at all. I went to the Google Drive folder and I was like, oh, this one needs music. Anyone got any notes?
[15:51.800 --> 15:57.140]  No, I didn't. What are you talking about? When did that happen? Is that you saying this is done or...
[15:57.140 --> 16:09.900]  Yeah, like, watch the thing. I've edited it. Where is it? I'd love to see it. You're a fool. You're a bunch of fools. I don't... if it was just me... Shut up. Get three different edits out the door in the same week. No one's even watching.
[16:10.240 --> 16:21.800]  I'll be honest. I was under the impression you just got too busy to deal with it. You had slow-mo guy stuff and that you just, like, forgot about it. And I was like, it's not a big deal. Like, we already got content out of it. So I was like, it's not a big deal.
[16:21.800 --> 16:38.560]  Now it's a really odd amount of time. I wish you would've... You wish I would've what? Put it in the Slack? I don't know that you did. I really don't... Scroll up! Where? To where? Maybe it was when I... maybe it was one of the times I quit. There it is! Eric, where'd you get that?
[16:38.820 --> 16:47.360]  Well, I searched. You said any notes on baseballs. I think it should probably have some background music. And then you didn't. And then that was... and then that was it.
[16:47.360 --> 17:07.000]  Sorry, do I need to do more than that? I said, does anyone have any notes on baseballs? Silence! And then nothing. Why did I bother? Right, but I didn't know it was done. What do you want from me? I'm very excited to watch this. I want you to say this is done. When was that posted? Like, May 3rd. Oh, God!
[17:08.160 --> 17:27.140]  This is a weird... Now, I know you're annoyed and you have every right to be, but we all missed it because we thought we were being courteous to you. This was missed with the best intent. I thought you were just super busy. I thought you were super busy and that you just hadn't got around to it. And I wasn't gonna be like, where the fuck are these videos that you said you would do? Like, I was just...
[17:27.720 --> 17:54.740]  So, no one's bugging me about it because you think I'm busy. I've already posted them and I'm thinking, oh, I guess nobody... I guess they've gone off or nobody had any notes. We're being respectful of your time. I will say I can't find... I'm looking and I can't find the beanhole one completed, but I don't know if that was completed or not. Again, if it was done... Is that not in the same folder? I just have the direct link to the video. I don't have the link to the folder. Yeah, it's just a link to a baseball. That might be on you.
[17:54.740 --> 17:57.600]  That one might be on me. I mean, they're both in there.
[17:58.440 --> 18:02.060]  Okay, but again, I don't have... I'm not sure... Like, I don't have the folder.
[18:03.040 --> 18:14.560]  Okay, so I messed up that one. I assumed I didn't find it. I assumed I linked to the folder. I just linked to one video in the folder. So, okay, I'll take the blame for beanhole not coming out.
[18:14.660 --> 18:18.920]  Oh, man, it's done too. It's right next to the other one. From May 3rd.
[18:19.280 --> 18:23.980]  When does this come out? What day does this come out? Because we can upload these when this airs.
[18:23.980 --> 18:25.520]  I'm excited. Can I see beanhole?
[18:25.840 --> 18:30.660]  This comes out the week of the 6th. So, July 6th.
[18:30.660 --> 18:38.160]  So, July 6th, this will become public on our YouTube channel. These will be posted. These have just been in the fuckface vault unknowingly.
[18:38.780 --> 18:44.040]  We're opening the fuckface vault to bring you incredible content.
[18:44.640 --> 18:51.560]  This podcast is such a piece of shit. We need money and people, and it doesn't work without it.
[18:52.000 --> 18:57.360]  Here's what I'll say. No one from the audience has asked about these videos, so they may not even want them.
[18:57.500 --> 19:04.920]  I feel like I haven't seen anything about them. I just assumed they came out and everyone was like, oh, okay.
[19:05.180 --> 19:09.120]  How do I see the beanhole? Yeah, where's the beanhole video?
[19:09.280 --> 19:11.000]  I'm not logged in. I'll have to send you the link.
[19:11.000 --> 19:16.360]  I can't back out of this video and up the tree or anything.
[19:16.360 --> 19:18.220]  It's just asking me how else I want to open this.
[19:19.620 --> 19:25.600]  I'm taking the blame on beanhole, but I did put baseballs up over two months ago.
[19:25.600 --> 19:27.200]  But you put baseballs up unfinished.
[19:28.300 --> 19:31.180]  It's done. I just wanted to know if you think I should have music on it or not.
[19:31.280 --> 19:36.560]  But I didn't know it was done. You're asking for notes. We didn't give notes, but you didn't say, okay, never mind then. It's done.
[19:37.140 --> 19:42.100]  I have to say, I need notes. By the way, it's done. What do you mean?
[19:42.480 --> 19:48.200]  What do I mean? You asked for notes and then didn't say anything else about it ever, so I didn't know it was done.
[19:48.200 --> 19:50.720]  If someone asks for notes, I'll say something immediately after.
[19:54.200 --> 20:00.380]  Gavin, we gave you a month to let us know it was done, and you just never kind of got back around to it, man.
[20:00.900 --> 20:05.300]  I want it on the record, Gavin. I'm on your side on this. I'm with you. I just missed it.
[20:05.640 --> 20:06.840]  Everyone ignored me.
[20:07.520 --> 20:10.860]  I didn't know it was there. I somehow missed that message.
[20:11.160 --> 20:16.480]  I don't want to be on either side, but I will say I think that Eric brings up a point.
[20:16.480 --> 20:21.540]  If you present it as, does this need background music, it probably does. Do you think you could throw some in?
[20:21.800 --> 20:22.600]  It sounds like it's not done.
[20:23.220 --> 20:24.840]  Can you paste what I wrote, Eric?
[20:26.960 --> 20:33.480]  Yes, it is right here. This is from Wednesday, May the 4th.
[20:34.860 --> 20:37.940]  Can you bleep the f*** faces too while you're at it?
[20:38.220 --> 20:41.540]  Oh, so it's not done?
[20:41.800 --> 20:42.900]  Yeah, it doesn't seem like it's done.
[20:45.300 --> 20:49.000]  Gavin posted a link to the Google Drive where Baseballs lives.
[20:49.840 --> 20:58.080]  Any notes on Baseballs? I think it should probably have some background music, and I still need to bleep the f*** faces.
[20:59.480 --> 21:01.420]  There's no indication that this is complete.
[21:02.340 --> 21:07.540]  I'm just doing finishing touches stuff. Any notes before I exploit for the final time?
[21:07.940 --> 21:11.380]  So we don't have the final export, is what you're telling me.
[21:11.380 --> 21:15.800]  Why would you give notes on the one that's being uploaded?
[21:16.240 --> 21:19.980]  I'm just saying we don't have it.
[21:21.520 --> 21:23.360]  So where's the final version?
[21:23.640 --> 21:24.560]  Yeah, because I don't have that.
[21:25.140 --> 21:27.880]  How do we get access to the final version?
[21:28.440 --> 21:30.940]  I'm sorry, I thought this was a collaborative process.
[21:31.160 --> 21:37.360]  I thought that if you wanted changes or if suddenly Geoff was like, oh, it shouldn't be this long, I thought I'd probably still cut it down.
[21:37.360 --> 21:44.760]  Before I waste time timing it to music, bleeping words that aren't gonna be in it, I thought maybe that was a good time to get some feedback.
[21:45.140 --> 21:47.340]  I apologize, I was clearly wrong.
[21:47.880 --> 21:54.540]  Let's literally just sit there in silence for six weeks, and I'll just shove both thumbs up my arse. How about that?
[21:56.740 --> 22:00.540]  I genuinely am so sad I didn't see that. I'm really sorry I missed it.
[22:00.540 --> 22:07.500]  I would have given any note, I would have given so many notes, I would have been the notiest note person of all time if I saw that video.
[22:07.860 --> 22:08.940]  I'm so sad I missed it.
[22:08.960 --> 22:16.340]  And I'll be honest, it's a very Geoff move to look at a video that's been uploaded and be like, wow, why is that 16 minutes? It should have been four.
[22:16.720 --> 22:20.160]  I will say, I absolutely agree with you on that, yes.
[22:21.100 --> 22:22.140]  What, that I have standards?
[22:22.780 --> 22:28.560]  You have standards after it's done. You don't have time before it's done.
[22:31.200 --> 22:35.600]  Listen, I very rarely have time to give notes.
[22:36.880 --> 22:38.360]  And I trust you guys.
[22:38.720 --> 22:40.480]  Until after where you're more than happy to.
[22:40.520 --> 22:42.660]  What are you talking about? When am I doing that?
[22:42.940 --> 22:46.060]  We need to factor in how contentious baseballs was for a time.
[22:46.200 --> 22:50.340]  Geoff almost quit this podcast because we posted a video of him missing baseballs.
[22:50.640 --> 22:51.520]  It was very close.
[22:52.500 --> 22:57.560]  Yeah, at least even though this one didn't come out, the other three about baseballs came out.
[22:59.100 --> 23:04.940]  I'll be honest with you, Gav. It totally sounds like we dropped the ball on responding to you in all seriousness.
[23:05.400 --> 23:09.240]  We should have either said, no, it's good to go. Go for it. Or I don't have time. I'm not going to watch this.
[23:09.520 --> 23:14.220]  I can't be bothered. Export it or whatever response. You got no response. So that is on us.
[23:14.400 --> 23:20.200]  But in our defense, I will say there were 3000 fucking baseball videos all at once.
[23:20.200 --> 23:22.360]  And I just missed this one, but I saw all the other ones.
[23:22.640 --> 23:25.400]  The one that took like seven hours to edit.
[23:25.660 --> 23:26.540]  I'm so sorry.
[23:26.540 --> 23:29.740]  That's all right. That's all right. And to be honest, I don't know why I thought it would have went up.
[23:29.840 --> 23:31.020]  I clearly hadn't bleeped.
[23:32.820 --> 23:36.420]  Honestly, just the silence of it. I just thought, oh, something's happened with it.
[23:36.620 --> 23:39.660]  I thought there's no way it just sat there in the slack unattended.
[23:40.040 --> 23:42.640]  I'm so glad we decided to record two of these today.
[23:42.980 --> 23:44.740]  Like how long this could have went.
[23:44.880 --> 23:49.800]  I'm so excited to watch the beanhole video. I cannot wait.
[23:50.220 --> 23:52.660]  Yeah, I've never seen it. I can't wait to get the link to it.
[23:53.080 --> 23:55.940]  Yeah, I would say a little a little peer behind the veil for the audience.
[23:56.080 --> 24:02.480]  There was a discussion where we recorded 109 and 110 back to back today because Eric and I have to go out of town for VidCon next week.
[24:03.720 --> 24:08.100]  And so there was some discussion about whether we had enough material for a second episode today.
[24:08.360 --> 24:10.200]  And I think we were all kind of on the fence on it.
[24:10.400 --> 24:16.160]  If we had decided not to do this, it might have been another six months before we found out about these videos.
[24:18.200 --> 24:19.000]  Thank God.
[24:20.080 --> 24:27.200]  When we did the second, like the next set of baseballs, it probably would have come up again of like, oh, it's too bad that we never got that video.
[24:27.400 --> 24:29.520]  This could be weeks from now.
[24:29.800 --> 24:30.500]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:30.560 --> 24:34.340]  Talking about the immense pizza oven follow up to a video that didn't come out.
[24:36.200 --> 24:39.720]  That's true. Nobody's ever seen the... well, audience, I apologize.
[24:39.960 --> 24:44.200]  In one of the videos, we have a whole conversation about how Gavin's going to cook a pizza in my pizza oven.
[24:45.000 --> 24:45.900]  I guess you haven't seen that.
[24:45.900 --> 24:49.740]  You need to save part of your destroyed pizza oven for the museum.
[24:50.620 --> 24:54.580]  Because it's part of the lore. If it cooks the pizza, you gotta save a chunk of it.
[24:54.640 --> 24:55.780]  Yeah, absolutely. I'll do that.
[24:56.460 --> 24:57.160]  It's a pizza wall.
[24:57.620 --> 24:58.640]  Gavin, how are you doing, man?
[24:59.080 --> 25:04.520]  I just remember how busy April and May were. I'm trying to squeeze those in for no reason.
[25:04.860 --> 25:08.800]  Hey, real fast, Gavin, real fast. Can I ask you a question?
[25:09.460 --> 25:10.780]  Which socks are you wearing today?
[25:11.320 --> 25:12.200]  What color?
[25:13.880 --> 25:15.200]  I'm wearing the old style.
[25:19.740 --> 25:21.120]  That is funny.
[25:22.720 --> 25:28.440]  That's actually... I'm not even mad. I'm not even mad because it became content on this one.
[25:28.680 --> 25:30.360]  But that is mind-blowing.
[25:31.240 --> 25:32.960]  Do you know why it happened, honestly?
[25:33.280 --> 25:38.140]  It wasn't like it was sent to one person. There's like ten people in that Slack.
[25:38.140 --> 25:42.800]  It happened because we have so many things going on all the time.
[25:43.200 --> 25:49.100]  Face is just like... it's just like a minefield of bits that we're dancing around.
[25:49.620 --> 25:53.200]  We were probably seven bits further by the time... you know what I mean?
[25:53.420 --> 25:54.760]  It's unfortunate.
[25:55.880 --> 25:57.020]  It's so funny.
[25:57.780 --> 26:00.860]  But it's so awesome that we found out. And we get to release these videos now.
[26:01.980 --> 26:03.020]  I don't think we need to.
[26:03.480 --> 26:04.300]  No, we need to.
[26:04.680 --> 26:05.440]  No, we do.
[26:06.380 --> 26:07.260]  They're coming out.
[26:07.640 --> 26:09.460]  I don't think the audience knew they were missing them.
[26:10.100 --> 26:12.820]  We talked about...
[26:12.820 --> 26:16.920]  Didn't we talk about how there were so many baseball videos coming out and I've got my supercut coming?
[26:17.120 --> 26:18.120]  I don't think anyone cared.
[26:18.460 --> 26:19.400]  No, I care.
[26:19.720 --> 26:22.100]  I've been anticipating this for weeks.
[26:22.320 --> 26:25.980]  They probably just saw the two baseball videos that were already out and thought that that's what you meant.
[26:27.080 --> 26:28.060]  Oh, I'm so excited.
[26:28.380 --> 26:31.260]  And then we're putting out stuff like the overkill. Oh, God.
[26:32.420 --> 26:33.420]  But we'll get them out.
[26:33.420 --> 26:34.940]  Oh, man.
[26:35.600 --> 26:44.400]  I wish I had that mechanism internally that allowed me to feel empathy for you in this moment.
[26:44.540 --> 26:45.420]  Because I think I would.
[26:46.280 --> 26:48.840]  I can see why I would.
[26:49.160 --> 26:50.060]  I don't.
[26:50.380 --> 26:50.820]  Clearly.
[26:52.240 --> 26:54.140]  But I kind of wish I did.
[26:54.260 --> 26:55.500]  I wish I felt bad for you right now.
[26:55.520 --> 26:56.840]  Because it seems like you're probably upset.
[26:57.100 --> 26:59.380]  I can imagine how annoying and frustrating that would be.
[26:59.380 --> 27:01.740]  If it was week of...
[27:01.740 --> 27:06.600]  I guess I've forgotten mostly of how busy all that time was.
[27:06.920 --> 27:09.320]  If it was closer to it, I'd probably be more annoyed.
[27:09.400 --> 27:10.660]  I'm not annoyed. It's funny.
[27:11.760 --> 27:13.640]  It's a very us thing to have happened.
[27:14.060 --> 27:14.740]  It is.
[27:15.500 --> 27:16.080]  Oh, man.

[30:12.760 --> 30:15.700]  Now a word from our sponsor, BetterHelp.
[30:16.520 --> 30:19.520]  It's so important to have methods that can help your mental health.
[30:20.020 --> 30:24.440]  I know for me, when I'm working through something, I found listening to music to be incredibly helpful.
[30:24.820 --> 30:29.540]  It allows me to be present while comfortably processing things in a way that other media doesn't,
[30:29.540 --> 30:35.240]  even though I love movies and video games, it's just a different experience I have when I'm listening to music.
[30:35.880 --> 30:38.660]  There's also BetterHelp online therapy.
[30:39.320 --> 30:43.040]  I've talked about it a lot, but therapy is something that has made a real impact in my life,
[30:43.100 --> 30:45.420]  so it's always something I would highly recommend trying.
[30:46.300 --> 30:49.180]  BetterHelp offers a large variety of communication methods,
[30:49.320 --> 30:51.860]  so you don't have to see anyone on camera if you don't want to.
[30:52.380 --> 30:58.060]  It's much more affordable than in-person therapy, and you can be matched with a therapist within 48 hours.

[31:12.640 --> 31:15.240]  Hey, I saw a comment the other day.
[31:15.400 --> 31:21.820]  I didn't write down who said it, unfortunately, but somebody said that it was their suspicion
[31:23.300 --> 31:33.040]  that future Gavin came back in time, climbed a tree, and threw the branch at past Gavin and framed me.
[31:33.180 --> 31:37.060]  So I have a question. Why is future Gavin trying to frame current Geoff?
[31:37.200 --> 31:38.640]  What does future you have against me?
[31:38.840 --> 31:41.460]  Because he fucking ignored his feedback on the baseball video?
[31:41.600 --> 31:43.600]  Is this how it starts?
[31:43.600 --> 31:44.160]  It's this.
[31:47.020 --> 31:51.540]  Yeah, if I'd have just heard, and that's for the baseballs, after I got hit, that would have been confusing.
[31:53.120 --> 31:58.600]  Yeah, I wonder why. I must have needed to move. Or maybe I was about to get sunburned or something.
[31:58.900 --> 32:04.700]  You were either saving your life, but I don't know why I'm getting the heat for it, like it was me, because I clearly didn't do it.
[32:05.020 --> 32:07.900]  I don't think there's any way I could have known you would take the heat for it, though.
[32:08.580 --> 32:10.880]  I mean, you knew everything. You were in the future.
[32:11.520 --> 32:11.960]  That's true.
[32:11.960 --> 32:15.100]  Does that mean it happened before this episode, though, or after?
[32:15.760 --> 32:17.840]  Do you have the power to time travel currently?
[32:17.980 --> 32:18.940]  That's a good point.
[32:19.080 --> 32:23.540]  Unless you just let something slip.
[32:25.080 --> 32:30.400]  That means... okay, so it's gonna have to be pretty soon, though, because I don't know whether I'm gonna be able to climb trees for that much longer.
[32:31.940 --> 32:35.320]  I'm not gonna be coming back in my 70s and do it, am I?
[32:36.060 --> 32:39.640]  I was thinking about, like, old people things.
[32:39.640 --> 32:43.340]  Have you ever heard a whippersnapper, like, unironically, in the wild?
[32:43.500 --> 32:45.020]  I don't think I've ever heard... really?
[32:45.580 --> 32:45.700]  Yeah.
[32:45.820 --> 32:48.240]  I'd love to be called a whippersnapper. What was the context?
[32:48.660 --> 32:51.240]  I mean, people used to say... dude, I'm so old.
[32:51.420 --> 32:54.660]  Like, I grew up in the late, late 70s and early 80s.
[32:54.920 --> 32:58.040]  People said shit... old people in Alabama said shit like that all the time.
[32:58.200 --> 32:58.520]  Really?
[32:59.260 --> 33:02.700]  Sport, and chief, and champ, and whippersnapper, yeah, all that stuff.
[33:04.320 --> 33:08.320]  Oh, that'd be great. I'd love to... I don't think there's any... I guess it's an insult.
[33:08.320 --> 33:12.040]  I think if I was going to be called an insult, that's probably number one on my big board.
[33:12.500 --> 33:13.880]  I don't think I've ever been called a whippersnapper.
[33:13.940 --> 33:14.140]  Is it an insult?
[33:14.140 --> 33:17.940]  I don't think it's an insult. I think it's more of, like, just a terminology for, like, a rambunctious kid.
[33:18.080 --> 33:19.920]  Like, oh, you whippersnapper. Yeah, you little rascal.
[33:19.920 --> 33:24.640]  But I feel like it's typically used in the context of, I'm sick of this kid. This asshole.
[33:25.440 --> 33:25.880]  Not in my experience.
[33:25.900 --> 33:28.020]  I feel like there's a negative connotation. Really? Interesting.
[33:28.460 --> 33:28.540]  Yeah.
[33:28.540 --> 33:32.920]  My perception of whippersnappers is totally off. Is it... is there an age limit?
[33:33.140 --> 33:35.520]  When do you exceed the line of whippersnapper?
[33:35.920 --> 33:37.820]  When do you age out of whippersnapper?
[33:37.820 --> 33:39.620]  But, like, is that...
[33:39.620 --> 33:42.980]  Age... sooner than aging out of climbing trees, I think.
[33:44.140 --> 33:49.120]  I was trying to figure out, is it dependent on the person saying it, or is there a clear line?
[33:49.480 --> 33:52.220]  Like, if they're 100, does the bar move?
[33:53.480 --> 34:01.000]  Because I would say if somebody who's, like, 70, they're probably maybe, like, 11 or 12, I'd assume is the cutoff.
[34:01.060 --> 34:06.940]  If they're, like, 100, I feel like it would be appropriate for them to call, like, a 20-year-old a whippersnapper.
[34:06.940 --> 34:11.340]  I bet a 100-year-old person has called a 70-year-old a whippersnapper.
[34:11.620 --> 34:11.920]  Probably.
[34:12.320 --> 34:12.460]  I think so.
[34:13.240 --> 34:14.340]  Yeah, I think that's happened.
[34:15.020 --> 34:18.800]  Well, I will say, Andrew, I think you are more right than I was.
[34:19.040 --> 34:32.480]  I don't ever remember being used derogatorily, but Dictionary Kid says that a whippersnapper is a young, impertinent, and irritatingly overconfident person.
[34:32.860 --> 34:34.280]  So I guess it is negative.
[34:34.900 --> 34:38.320]  Yeah, well, I always feel like these damn whippersnappers...
[34:38.320 --> 34:40.480]  I guess I've only heard it ironically.
[34:40.700 --> 34:46.500]  That's what I mean, but even in the ironic context, I feel like it's aimed at somebody who's doing something against the person saying it.
[34:46.800 --> 34:51.600]  Did you see that picture recently of the Queen coming out on her balcony, stood next to Prince Charles?
[34:51.780 --> 34:56.820]  It's basically an old woman stood next to an old man, but it's her kid.
[34:57.100 --> 34:58.640]  But I bet she could call him a whippersnapper.
[34:59.460 --> 35:03.260]  Gavin, I don't know if this is, like, a not-British DNA thing.
[35:03.260 --> 35:06.740]  I don't think I've ever just come across a photo of the Queen, ever.
[35:08.020 --> 35:10.300]  Me seeing the Queen never comes into play.
[35:10.340 --> 35:12.440]  It was in the news. It was a big jubilee.
[35:12.540 --> 35:13.660]  Yeah, it was the Platinum Jubilee.
[35:13.980 --> 35:15.820]  I don't know. I have no idea.
[35:15.880 --> 35:17.020]  You don't know about the Platinum Jubilee?
[35:18.700 --> 35:20.380]  I'm aware of Platinum Games.
[35:21.500 --> 35:23.740]  I don't know of Platinum Jubilee.
[35:23.860 --> 35:28.320]  This year was the 70th anniversary of her reign as monarch.
[35:29.160 --> 35:30.160]  That's right, right, Gavin?
[35:30.520 --> 35:31.560]  I'm not getting this wrong.
[35:31.560 --> 35:34.160]  I mean, complete respect to her.
[35:34.600 --> 35:37.720]  You couldn't measure how insignificant that is to me.
[35:38.040 --> 35:39.860]  Fuck it, I couldn't care less. Who cares?
[35:40.240 --> 35:42.460]  I think she's the second longest living monarch.
[35:42.980 --> 35:44.180]  I couldn't care less.
[35:44.740 --> 35:45.860]  Well, I mean, you don't have to...
[35:45.860 --> 35:48.560]  I'm just saying, it was in the damn news.
[35:48.940 --> 35:51.040]  It's not in my world. I didn't see that news.
[35:51.280 --> 35:52.980]  That's not the picture that comes across my sheet.
[35:53.540 --> 35:54.560]  Oh, shit. What the...
[35:55.100 --> 35:56.840]  Aren't you part of England or something?
[35:57.320 --> 35:58.920]  I saw her with Paddington Bear.
[35:59.320 --> 35:59.840]  That was cool.
[35:59.980 --> 36:00.720]  She's on your money.
[36:00.720 --> 36:02.220]  Yeah, aren't you guys...
[36:02.220 --> 36:02.880]  Aren't you British?
[36:03.680 --> 36:05.720]  Yeah, but I don't use...
[36:06.480 --> 36:07.960]  Oh, what a cute photo.
[36:08.600 --> 36:09.560]  That is a nice photo.
[36:09.800 --> 36:11.720]  The guy on the left, that's a kid.
[36:12.280 --> 36:14.320]  And the guy to her right...
[36:14.320 --> 36:16.160]  Well, he murdered his wife, right?
[36:16.800 --> 36:17.840]  Didn't he kill his wife?
[36:19.020 --> 36:19.940]  Prince William?
[36:20.820 --> 36:21.820]  On the right.
[36:22.260 --> 36:23.540]  Her right, not my right.
[36:23.940 --> 36:25.500]  The kid?
[36:25.780 --> 36:27.320]  No, not the kid.
[36:28.560 --> 36:29.980]  Who is he?
[36:29.980 --> 36:30.940]  Prince Charles?
[36:31.840 --> 36:32.360]  Charles?
[36:33.920 --> 36:35.420]  Didn't Charles kill Diana?
[36:35.900 --> 36:36.260]  No!
[36:37.200 --> 36:39.040]  I thought he killed her. I'm sorry.
[36:39.480 --> 36:43.300]  She died running from paparazzi in a tunnel with Dodi Fayed.
[36:44.060 --> 36:47.880]  I feel like I've heard that he killed her.
[36:47.980 --> 36:52.260]  Dude, there is a conspiracy theory for every celebrity death ever made.
[36:52.360 --> 36:53.760]  But that's not a large one, I don't think.
[36:54.540 --> 36:56.640]  Yeah, that guy... Charles is her son.
[36:57.240 --> 36:58.620]  So the picture's left, but...
[36:58.620 --> 37:01.300]  Yeah, that's Charles and Camilla.
[37:02.220 --> 37:02.660]  Yeah.
[37:03.540 --> 37:05.640]  Didn't he cheat on Diana with Camilla?
[37:05.980 --> 37:06.220]  Yes.
[37:06.760 --> 37:07.880]  So that's right.
[37:08.580 --> 37:11.480]  Why don't you just start saying allegedly every time you have peed your mouth?
[37:11.620 --> 37:13.080]  Well, I'm asking questions.
[37:13.260 --> 37:15.120]  I'm not saying these as facts.
[37:15.300 --> 37:16.880]  I phrase both of these as questions.
[37:17.160 --> 37:21.520]  I feel like I need to step in and say this before you go too far down this road, Andrew.
[37:22.180 --> 37:26.380]  Just so you know, Gavin knows next to nothing about England.
[37:26.380 --> 37:30.780]  So his English knowledge is brutally limited.
[37:30.940 --> 37:31.980]  I've learned over the years.
[37:32.120 --> 37:35.100]  So just take some of the stuff he says with a grain of salt.
[37:35.500 --> 37:36.380]  Ask me a question, Andrew.
[37:38.700 --> 37:40.360]  I don't even know what to ask.
[37:40.560 --> 37:42.920]  Are those William's kids?
[37:43.100 --> 37:44.980]  I think that's William to the left, right?
[37:45.080 --> 37:47.660]  That's William and Kate.
[37:48.060 --> 37:49.080]  Yep, that's the kids.
[37:50.600 --> 37:54.160]  I keep wanting to say McKinnon, but it's definitely not Kate McKinnon.
[37:54.700 --> 37:54.980]  Middleton.
[37:55.580 --> 37:57.060]  Middleton, yeah.
[37:57.840 --> 37:59.580]  Okay, those are their kids.
[38:00.260 --> 38:04.080]  And you're saying that she could refer to those kids as whippersnappers.
[38:04.780 --> 38:05.260]  What?
[38:05.680 --> 38:10.140]  She could refer to her son, who's next to her, who's 70 years old, as a whippersnapper.
[38:10.140 --> 38:12.100]  The queen could call Charles a whippersnapper.
[38:12.180 --> 38:12.600]  Got it.
[38:12.640 --> 38:14.380]  It's like an ironic...
[38:15.040 --> 38:15.540]  Understood.
[38:16.880 --> 38:18.920]  I don't know anything about the royal family.
[38:19.180 --> 38:19.980]  They're not part of my world.
[38:19.980 --> 38:21.920]  How does Geoff know more about it than you, though?
[38:21.920 --> 38:24.500]  It's not part of my world.
[38:24.720 --> 38:25.360]  It's the Commonwealth.
[38:26.100 --> 38:28.660]  I don't know what to tell you. I don't think about them at all.
[38:29.100 --> 38:31.480]  It's literally more part of your world than mine.
[38:31.900 --> 38:36.640]  I just know about shit because, well, A, I was in London a month ago and they were setting up for the Platinum Jubilee.
[38:37.580 --> 38:41.500]  But B, I just pay attention to the world and what's happening in it.
[38:41.800 --> 38:44.380]  I guess my world doesn't contain the royal family.
[38:44.620 --> 38:46.880]  It literally does, though. You're a part of the British Commonwealth.
[38:47.560 --> 38:49.880]  Yeah, but it's not in my peripheral.
[38:49.880 --> 38:52.000]  I get what you're saying, but it's just...
[38:52.000 --> 38:52.200]  It's in your wallet.
[38:53.160 --> 38:55.600]  No, I don't have any cash on me.
[38:55.600 --> 38:56.880]  Okay. Alright.
[38:57.780 --> 38:59.700]  Andrew's heavily invested in altcoin.
[38:59.860 --> 39:00.880]  He pays for everything with Dogecoin.
[39:00.880 --> 39:03.740]  No, I'm not. Absolutely not.
[39:03.800 --> 39:06.240]  I could tell you about Bayonetta, Platinum Games.
[39:06.420 --> 39:07.640]  I know a lot about Platinum Games.
[39:08.180 --> 39:08.920]  Bayonetta 2?
[39:09.300 --> 39:09.640]  Okay.
[39:10.320 --> 39:13.700]  Nier Automata? Is that how you say that one?
[39:14.040 --> 39:17.680]  They make great games. I just don't know anything about Platinum Jubilee.
[39:17.680 --> 39:21.920]  Is that just a title that she got for reigning so long, or what is...?
[39:21.920 --> 39:25.580]  Well, Platinum is just like a... you know how people have wedding anniversaries and stuff?
[39:26.260 --> 39:26.840]  I see.
[39:27.200 --> 39:29.780]  Like a golden anniversary. Usually different decades.
[39:30.320 --> 39:33.320]  Do you think the Queen ever used her gold-plated Wii?
[39:34.260 --> 39:37.600]  There's some video game company that... there was some other anniversary of hers.
[39:37.740 --> 39:39.000]  They sent her a gold Wii.
[39:39.700 --> 39:40.640]  Do you think she ever got that?
[39:40.900 --> 39:44.120]  Do you think the Queen has ever played Wii Bowling?
[39:45.200 --> 39:45.680]  Uh...
[39:45.680 --> 39:46.980]  I feel like absolutely.
[39:47.220 --> 39:47.720]  I bet she gave it a go.
[39:48.080 --> 40:05.180]  I bet there is a whole wing of Buckingham Palace where dignitaries and foreign leaders and kings and queens of other monarchies have given gifts to the royal family that just get chucked in... like, throw it in that room.
[40:05.520 --> 40:08.360]  They get so much of it. I'm sure she doesn't see 90% of it.
[40:08.620 --> 40:11.160]  Yeah, I don't think she... I also don't think she needs any more gold.
[40:11.300 --> 40:12.240]  So she probably didn't even...
[40:12.240 --> 40:15.420]  So is it Nintendo or another company just did that?
[40:15.980 --> 40:18.360]  I think a different company did that. I don't think it was Nintendo.
[40:19.220 --> 40:20.880]  I think they were trying to promote their game.
[40:20.980 --> 40:21.980]  I don't remember what it was for.
[40:22.080 --> 40:24.080]  It was like a $250,000 Wii or something.
[40:24.520 --> 40:24.780]  Jesus.
[40:25.600 --> 40:31.580]  So would you say that the Queen has more or less gifts than Price is Right winners have prizes?
[40:32.180 --> 40:33.900]  If you're going to measure those against each other.
[40:34.020 --> 40:34.460]  More.
[40:34.920 --> 40:35.440]  Way more.
[40:37.360 --> 40:40.240]  And she doesn't have to pay all the tax on it.
[40:40.240 --> 40:41.820]  I bet the Queen...
[40:41.820 --> 40:47.160]  I bet the Queen could have a tag sale at Buckingham Palace that would blow you away.
[40:47.860 --> 40:50.640]  Do you think the Queen would be interested in a metal bread clip?
[40:51.300 --> 40:52.600]  She might. I don't know.
[40:52.900 --> 40:54.640]  I just watched Martha Stewart's...
[40:54.640 --> 40:55.140]  Let's make a gold bread clip.
[40:55.520 --> 40:58.340]  I just watched Martha Stewart's Great American Yard Sale or whatever.
[40:58.480 --> 40:59.600]  I don't know why the Queen wouldn't do it.
[41:00.160 --> 41:02.960]  Martha Stewart is the closest thing to American royalty we have.
[41:03.380 --> 41:04.320]  What was she getting rid of?
[41:04.840 --> 41:06.300]  Dude, she got rid of so much stuff.
[41:06.920 --> 41:09.300]  She got rid of a lot of different cutlery.
[41:09.300 --> 41:11.620]  She got rid of some really old knives.
[41:11.760 --> 41:14.460]  She got rid of a bunch of really pretty plates.
[41:14.660 --> 41:15.640]  And furniture.
[41:16.380 --> 41:17.620]  Like chest of drawers.
[41:17.940 --> 41:19.220]  I don't know. You watch it. It's on Hulu.
[41:19.340 --> 41:19.920]  I watch the whole thing.
[41:22.360 --> 41:24.240]  So all that came from whippersnappers, huh?
[41:24.980 --> 41:25.440]  I guess.
[41:28.320 --> 41:29.300]  What a fucking...
[41:30.580 --> 41:31.780]  Do you think...
[41:31.780 --> 41:33.940]  This is another thought I had recently.
[41:34.160 --> 41:34.440]  Uh oh.
[41:34.640 --> 41:37.040]  Do you think anyone has stolen
[41:37.040 --> 41:38.900]  the equivalent of what
[41:38.900 --> 41:40.920]  somebody has made in Oceans 11
[41:40.920 --> 41:42.180]  in small goods?
[41:42.700 --> 41:45.020]  What's the most value amount somebody has
[41:45.020 --> 41:47.160]  stolen? I don't know, like going into Walmart
[41:47.160 --> 41:48.360]  and stealing an apple.
[41:48.820 --> 41:49.700]  Scrumping an apple.
[41:49.940 --> 41:51.880]  Or a chocolate bar.
[41:52.120 --> 41:54.160]  Something very cheap.
[41:54.460 --> 41:56.220]  Low value but extreme quantities.
[41:56.320 --> 41:58.320]  Low value but extreme quantities.
[41:58.480 --> 42:00.840]  Has somebody gotten what would be the equivalent
[42:00.840 --> 42:02.980]  of a cut of an Oceans heist
[42:02.980 --> 42:05.060]  throughout their life in apples
[42:05.060 --> 42:07.140]  or candy? Small items.
[42:07.280 --> 42:08.520]  What's the most anyone
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.020]  without getting caught has successfully
[42:11.020 --> 42:12.400]  stolen in small quantities?
[42:13.240 --> 42:15.280]  Would that even be feasible? Could you steal
[42:15.280 --> 42:16.480]  enough, let's just say
[42:16.480 --> 42:18.980]  I don't know, like bottles of soda
[42:18.980 --> 42:19.920]  or candy bars?
[42:20.240 --> 42:22.540]  Wasn't that kind of the plot of Authorspace?
[42:22.880 --> 42:24.240]  To steal tenths of a cent?
[42:24.340 --> 42:25.380]  It was, yeah.
[42:25.780 --> 42:28.260]  But that was like a digital...
[42:28.260 --> 42:29.900]  That was like how they were moving pennies.
[42:29.960 --> 42:32.000]  There was no physical transaction in that.
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.020]  I'm just imagining, you know how like a serial
[42:34.020 --> 42:36.100]  killer has their trophies? Like a guy that only
[42:36.100 --> 42:37.560]  steals like, oh, Henry Bars
[42:37.560 --> 42:40.220]  has like 20,000 wrappers in his house.
[42:41.540 --> 42:42.140]  What if
[42:42.140 --> 42:44.140]  someone went around and took
[42:44.140 --> 42:45.960]  all of the first dollars from every
[42:45.960 --> 42:47.540]  business? Like the Frames store.
[42:49.000 --> 42:49.900]  I wonder how many
[42:49.900 --> 42:51.940]  first... I wonder how rich you would be if you had
[42:51.940 --> 42:53.560]  every first dollar in the world.
[42:54.380 --> 42:55.660]  I'd be really rich.
[42:56.740 --> 42:58.040]  I saw... You'd obviously have to frame the
[42:58.040 --> 42:59.980]  first one you stole. This is a
[42:59.980 --> 43:01.700]  little bit of an aside, but it reminded me.
[43:01.840 --> 43:03.900]  I saw the other day that Shaq
[43:03.900 --> 43:06.060]  said he had the largest single purchase
[43:06.060 --> 43:07.860]  in the history of Walmart. Wow.
[43:08.320 --> 43:10.000]  Wow. I don't know if it's true or how
[43:10.000 --> 43:11.980]  it was verified, but apparently he was
[43:11.980 --> 43:13.220]  saying when he got traded... What, he'd buy at Walmart?
[43:13.440 --> 43:15.540]  When he got traded from Orlando to Phoenix,
[43:16.100 --> 43:17.700]  he got to Phoenix and had nothing.
[43:17.820 --> 43:19.740]  And he just said, I'm gonna buy everything I need.
[43:19.780 --> 43:21.840]  And he went to Walmart at like three in the morning
[43:21.840 --> 43:23.540]  and spent... bought $70,000
[43:23.540 --> 43:25.940]  worth of stuff in one purchase
[43:25.940 --> 43:27.940]  from Walmart. That was back when he played
[43:27.940 --> 43:30.000]  for Phoenix, so it's possible some other
[43:30.000 --> 43:31.920]  person has spent more
[43:31.920 --> 43:33.700]  at Walmart since then, but
[43:33.700 --> 43:35.840]  according to him, when he played for the
[43:35.840 --> 43:37.420]  Phoenix Suns, he had the largest
[43:37.960 --> 43:39.680]  single purchase in the history of...
[43:39.680 --> 43:42.100]  He thought, I'll give money to the richest
[43:42.100 --> 43:43.180]  family in America. Yeah.
[43:43.940 --> 43:46.060]  Could you imagine trying to park a moving
[43:46.060 --> 43:48.060]  truck in a standard parking space?
[43:52.020 --> 43:53.500]  You'd just have to take a whole row.
[43:53.740 --> 43:55.880]  And people couldn't even be mad at it. I love the idea of
[43:55.880 --> 43:57.920]  Shaq, like, parking his moving truck
[43:57.920 --> 43:59.660]  to the front of Walmart. Just be like,
[43:59.740 --> 44:01.960]  we're loading up. I need chairs, I need
[44:01.960 --> 44:03.960]  tables, I need lights.
[44:04.940 --> 44:05.580]  $70,000?
[44:05.860 --> 44:07.180]  Does that, like, go through a checkout?
[44:07.700 --> 44:10.080]  Yeah. He said he, like, paid for it with his...
[44:10.080 --> 44:11.880]  Like, so I didn't... I was kind of, like, half
[44:11.880 --> 44:13.660]  listening. It was... I was doing something else at the time.
[44:14.060 --> 44:15.840]  But he said that his credit card got
[44:15.840 --> 44:17.780]  declined. And he was like, run it again.
[44:17.820 --> 44:19.800]  I ain't poor. And then they tried again and his credit
[44:19.800 --> 44:21.980]  card got declined. And then he had to call, like, American Express
[44:21.980 --> 44:24.000]  or whoever and, like, convince them that it was him.
[44:24.000 --> 44:26.060]  And he said he got a call and they were like, Shaq, you're never
[44:26.060 --> 44:28.240]  gonna believe this, but somebody just tried to spend $70,000
[44:28.240 --> 44:30.040]  of your money at Walmart. And he's like, I'm
[44:30.040 --> 44:31.960]  that guy, it's me. So they proved it.
[44:34.160 --> 44:36.240]  Eric said, imagine being behind him in line.
[44:36.440 --> 44:38.180]  That'd be great. How many shopping
[44:38.180 --> 44:39.080]  carts he would need?
[44:40.740 --> 44:42.160]  Or the idea of him trying to, like,
[44:42.240 --> 44:43.740]  sneak in Express Checkout.
[44:44.180 --> 44:46.020]  Like, it crosses the line of
[44:46.020 --> 44:48.100]  so absurd that you just have to allow it.
[44:48.400 --> 44:49.920]  He said he bought... He was like, I bought, like, seven
[44:49.920 --> 44:52.160]  TVs, you know, all stereos.
[44:52.160 --> 44:53.740]  I had to buy, like, underwear, toothpaste,
[44:54.080 --> 44:56.200]  T-shirts, plates. Like, he bought
[44:56.200 --> 44:58.100]  an entire life. Like, everything a person
[44:58.100 --> 45:00.200]  would need to live. I guess he just left everything else
[45:00.200 --> 45:01.780]  in Orlando and was like, I'll see you eventually.
[45:02.500 --> 45:04.280]  Seven TVs. Yeah, I was about to say
[45:04.280 --> 45:06.020]  I love the idea of, I'm getting all the essentials.
[45:06.260 --> 45:08.140]  Seven TVs. We're opening with seven
[45:08.140 --> 45:09.760]  TVs. Need seven of those.
[45:10.340 --> 45:12.180]  What could you do with seven? Yeah, not
[45:12.180 --> 45:13.480]  start with one.
[45:13.940 --> 45:16.080]  We'll see how many more I need. Just start with seven.
[45:16.560 --> 45:18.140]  You're really committed to the tech
[45:18.140 --> 45:20.240]  of that time, too. Not to, like,
[45:20.240 --> 45:22.500]  we've had TV talk recently, but TVs
[45:22.500 --> 45:24.100]  I feel like are changing, like, every
[45:24.100 --> 45:26.340]  five years. Like, buying all
[45:26.340 --> 45:28.300]  seven at the same time is a decision.
[45:28.560 --> 45:30.560]  Alright, I gotta figure out what year it was
[45:30.560 --> 45:32.660]  that he... Yeah, they could have been CRTs.
[45:32.880 --> 45:33.460]  Hold on a second. Yeah.
[45:33.720 --> 45:36.520]  Oh, God. You would need an entire truck
[45:36.520 --> 45:37.640]  just for the CRTs.
[45:38.100 --> 45:40.240]  So, he played for
[45:40.240 --> 45:42.480]  the Phoenix Suns. Oh, no. 2008
[45:42.480 --> 45:44.120]  to 2009. They weren't CRTs.
[45:44.680 --> 45:46.320]  Ah. 2008, he was getting
[45:46.320 --> 45:47.560]  flat screens. That's disappointing.
[45:47.560 --> 45:49.820]  That's definite flat screen territory.
[45:50.060 --> 45:51.480]  What does show me mean?
[45:51.760 --> 45:53.300]  Just talk to Eric. Oh.
[45:53.660 --> 45:55.620]  Oh, no, we were in
[45:55.620 --> 45:57.600]  a space, and Geoff pointed
[45:57.600 --> 45:59.340]  at a TV and just kept going,
[45:59.500 --> 46:01.480]  huh? Right? See?
[46:01.900 --> 46:03.380]  And I didn't know what the fuck he was talking about,
[46:03.560 --> 46:05.380]  but it was just a frame around a TV.
[46:05.960 --> 46:07.240]  He was so thrilled about it.
[46:07.500 --> 46:09.460]  That was pretty cool. Why does...
[46:09.460 --> 46:11.480]  Nick said, I love a frame around a TV. Why?
[46:12.040 --> 46:13.720]  Why, Nick? This just looks nice.
[46:13.820 --> 46:15.320]  Look at this. But it doesn't.
[46:15.320 --> 46:17.100]  Like, when it's on, it does.
[46:19.260 --> 46:20.900]  When it's off, you can never show the Mona Lisa.
[46:22.260 --> 46:22.740]  But...
[46:22.740 --> 46:24.840]  I don't think TVs look ugly.
[46:25.180 --> 46:27.340]  TV when it's on, art when it's off
[46:27.340 --> 46:28.440]  is how they describe it.
[46:29.680 --> 46:31.560]  Nick said it's relaxing.
[46:32.080 --> 46:33.400]  I agree. So, look at a frame
[46:33.400 --> 46:35.060]  around a TV.
[46:36.560 --> 46:37.520]  Relaxes Nick.
[46:40.300 --> 46:41.420]  I know how when
[46:41.420 --> 46:43.440]  you're so stressed out,
[46:43.440 --> 46:44.880]  you're just like, I need something
[46:44.880 --> 46:46.000]  to calm me down.
[46:46.680 --> 46:48.080]  As Nick calls it,
[46:48.940 --> 46:49.900]  glowing art.
[46:52.260 --> 46:53.460]  I am right there with Nick.
[46:53.580 --> 46:55.220]  You guys are making fun of him for
[46:55.220 --> 46:56.580]  totally valid.
[46:57.160 --> 46:57.800]  Hell yeah, Nick.
[46:59.040 --> 47:01.020]  A TV off with no image.
[47:01.700 --> 47:03.240]  If it has an image and it's art,
[47:03.440 --> 47:05.280]  like they're displaying, that's fine.
[47:05.800 --> 47:07.460]  But when you turn off a TV
[47:07.460 --> 47:09.100]  and it's just a blank screen
[47:09.100 --> 47:11.260]  with a frame around it, it looks
[47:11.260 --> 47:12.900]  uglier than just a TV does.
[47:13.000 --> 47:13.840]  I don't think it does that.
[47:13.960 --> 47:16.020]  It goes into an art mode.
[47:16.300 --> 47:19.040]  You sent me a photo of a TV that was turned off
[47:19.040 --> 47:20.680]  completely that had a frame around it.
[47:20.740 --> 47:21.280]  I've seen it.
[47:22.020 --> 47:23.880]  That was the RT one that they handmade.
[47:24.080 --> 47:25.740]  These are the ones that you buy.
[47:25.920 --> 47:28.320]  The handmade part of it was great.
[47:28.800 --> 47:29.820]  I think that looked awesome.
[47:30.940 --> 47:33.340]  Listen, they're not using it
[47:33.340 --> 47:34.640]  to the
[47:35.080 --> 47:36.140]  height of its potential.
[47:36.760 --> 47:37.600]  But that's my point.
[47:37.600 --> 47:40.240]  Unless they all have that
[47:40.240 --> 47:42.040]  where it's pre-built or whatever.
[47:42.360 --> 47:42.580]  They do.
[47:42.960 --> 47:45.600]  Turn the TV off to bring the masterpieces to life.
[47:45.660 --> 47:47.720]  Simply press the power button on the One Remote
[47:47.720 --> 47:50.220]  and watch Art Mode turn your blank TV screen
[47:50.220 --> 47:52.260]  into a private exhibit of curated creations.
[47:52.380 --> 47:53.720]  Why am I trying to sell these fucking TVs?
[47:53.780 --> 47:54.700]  I don't even have one.
[47:55.360 --> 47:56.080]  I just think it's cool.
[47:56.360 --> 47:58.420]  At least.
[47:58.820 --> 47:59.920]  What was his jersey number?
[48:01.820 --> 48:03.280]  What did he play as?
[48:03.360 --> 48:05.100]  I think he probably bounced around
[48:05.100 --> 48:06.360]  depending on where he was playing.
[48:07.140 --> 48:08.660]  He played for a lot of teams.
[48:09.380 --> 48:10.160]  34, Eric thinks?
[48:10.620 --> 48:13.840]  He was 34 in LA, 32 in Miami,
[48:14.080 --> 48:15.960]  33 when he was at LSU,
[48:16.420 --> 48:17.620]  32 on the Suns,
[48:17.740 --> 48:19.020]  36 in Boston,
[48:19.580 --> 48:20.640]  32 on the Magic,
[48:20.800 --> 48:22.240]  and 33 on the Cavs.
[48:22.420 --> 48:24.600]  So he's just a 32 to 36
[48:25.600 --> 48:26.520]  runner there.
[48:26.800 --> 48:29.020]  36 for the Celtics is Marcus Smart
[48:29.020 --> 48:31.460]  currently. Here's hoping that number gets retired
[48:31.460 --> 48:32.880]  and nobody will ever be 36 again.
[48:34.100 --> 48:35.100]  It's tomorrow, right?
[48:35.360 --> 48:36.720]  Game 6? Tonight.
[48:36.800 --> 48:38.160]  Tonight? I thought it was Friday.
[48:38.560 --> 48:39.100]  It's Thursday night.
[48:39.840 --> 48:41.100]  It's Thursday? Fuck.
[48:41.940 --> 48:45.060]  Jesus, I was not mentally prepared
[48:45.060 --> 48:45.800]  for this.
[48:46.080 --> 48:48.620]  I'm also not mentally prepared for this
[48:48.620 --> 48:50.560]  and I've been trying all fucking week.
[48:50.780 --> 48:51.980]  I feel like they're gonna win.
[48:52.740 --> 48:54.600]  The best part is people already know.
[48:55.160 --> 48:55.780]  They'll know what happened.
[48:55.800 --> 48:56.700]  You know what's fucked up, dude?
[48:57.100 --> 49:00.060]  If they win this game tonight, which would be awesome,
[49:00.060 --> 49:01.920]  do you know when they play game 7?
[49:02.600 --> 49:03.900]  When? On my birthday.
[49:07.180 --> 49:07.760]  That?
[49:08.000 --> 49:09.820]  Who? Yeah. That's
[49:09.820 --> 49:11.980]  a... Yeah. Wow.
[49:12.280 --> 49:13.880]  That's high stakes. You think
[49:13.880 --> 49:15.880]  like... Talk about good socks, bad
[49:15.880 --> 49:17.980]  socks. Uh...
[49:17.980 --> 49:19.240]  Fucking... The
[49:19.900 --> 49:21.460]  risk of them
[49:21.460 --> 49:23.880]  shitting the bed on my birthday and me
[49:23.880 --> 49:25.800]  having to deal with that for the rest of my fucking
[49:26.880 --> 49:27.460]  life...
[49:28.060 --> 49:29.460]  Wow. Yeah.
[49:30.060 --> 49:31.500]  It was almost like when you dropped
[49:31.500 --> 49:33.420]  that Derek White card and you cursed that entire
[49:33.420 --> 49:35.120]  game potentially. You had that weight on.
[49:37.260 --> 49:39.620]  Well, let's hope they win. Yeah, well...
[49:39.620 --> 49:41.500]  Fingers crossed. I think they'll win
[49:41.500 --> 49:43.480]  tonight. I'd be shocked if they lose three in a row.
[49:43.780 --> 49:44.880]  Gavin said...
[49:45.430 --> 49:47.420]  Eric asked Gavin what the final score for the game
[49:47.420 --> 49:49.380]  will be and Gavin said
[49:49.380 --> 49:50.400]  80-94.
[49:51.160 --> 49:53.580]  That would be an incredibly low-scoring
[49:53.580 --> 49:53.860]  game.
[49:56.260 --> 49:57.780]  I mean, it could happen
[49:57.780 --> 49:59.660]  but given the playoff... I mean, they're two
[49:59.660 --> 50:01.620]  of the best defenses in basketball. I think it's more
[50:01.620 --> 50:03.640]  likely going to be in the low 100s.
[50:03.780 --> 50:05.620]  Probably 104, 112 or
[50:05.620 --> 50:07.620]  something. But yeah. 80-94
[50:07.620 --> 50:09.820]  is bold. I hope to god
[50:09.820 --> 50:11.540]  the Celtics score more than 80 points tonight.
[50:12.580 --> 50:13.760]  Oh, good! Eric's trying to see
[50:13.760 --> 50:15.480]  if he's a time traveler. That's excellent. That's excellent.
[50:15.560 --> 50:17.660]  You might have just caught him in a loop. It's a weird
[50:17.660 --> 50:19.120]  sport of basketball. It's a lot of
[50:20.160 --> 50:21.520]  scoring. Yeah.
[50:21.780 --> 50:22.460]  Yeah, they like to score.
[50:23.440 --> 50:25.560]  Why does that make it... I guess if you're
[50:25.560 --> 50:27.480]  soccer. Because if both teams are going to
[50:27.480 --> 50:29.680]  score the low 100s, it's like, how many times
[50:29.680 --> 50:31.180]  are you really excited when it happens?
[50:31.580 --> 50:33.460]  Yeah. Yeah. Really? Yeah, you are.
[50:33.680 --> 50:35.140]  It's exciting all the way through.
[50:35.720 --> 50:37.180]  There's too much scoring.
[50:37.420 --> 50:39.120]  Ugh. Points. Ugh.
[50:39.440 --> 50:41.620]  What are you talking about? I just think
[50:41.620 --> 50:43.500]  if something happens all the time while you're watching
[50:43.500 --> 50:45.540]  it, it's not interesting. Let's have a
[50:45.540 --> 50:47.560]  fucking blast and watch 1-1 go to
[50:47.560 --> 50:49.200]  a tie. Let's fucking woo.
[50:49.620 --> 50:51.400]  That's great. Thrilling.
[50:51.900 --> 50:53.040]  Thrilling high stakes.
[50:53.040 --> 50:55.040]  I'm not saying I agree or disagree
[50:55.040 --> 50:57.160]  with you, Gavin, but did you
[50:57.160 --> 50:59.200]  say that something's always happening
[50:59.200 --> 51:01.220]  and so it's not interesting?
[51:01.780 --> 51:03.120]  Like if a
[51:03.780 --> 51:04.860]  Michael Bay movie,
[51:05.660 --> 51:07.200]  if it was like two and a half
[51:07.200 --> 51:09.220]  hours of explosions, which a lot
[51:09.220 --> 51:11.020]  of the time it would go on for like 20 minutes
[51:11.020 --> 51:11.900]  and it's like...
[51:11.900 --> 51:15.140]  It cheapens it. I understand what you're
[51:15.140 --> 51:17.180]  saying, but it would be like saying there's too much running
[51:17.180 --> 51:18.860]  in soccer. It cheapens it.
[51:19.220 --> 51:21.060]  Like the movement of the... You're not there. You're not cheering
[51:21.060 --> 51:23.240]  a run. You're cheering a goal.
[51:23.600 --> 51:24.560]  But you are cheering runs.
[51:24.660 --> 51:26.640]  You're cheering the momentum of a run.
[51:26.800 --> 51:29.160]  A team can go on a 10-0 run and change
[51:29.160 --> 51:29.860]  the entire
[51:30.780 --> 51:32.980]  forecast of the game. The end result is I hope they
[51:32.980 --> 51:35.140]  score a goal. But what about...
[51:35.140 --> 51:36.880]  Are you okay with the fact that at most
[51:36.880 --> 51:38.520]  they're scoring three points per
[51:38.960 --> 51:40.680]  score? It's not like football.
[51:40.880 --> 51:43.040]  Six points guarantee you a touchdown. You gotta really
[51:43.040 --> 51:44.880]  work for those points. If you're Steph Curry, you're allowed to have
[51:44.880 --> 51:46.240]  a seven point play, apparently.
[51:46.720 --> 51:48.820]  Does the number a point? It's just an
[51:49.360 --> 51:50.860]  insane... Do you think games
[51:50.860 --> 51:52.960]  should have a limited mechanism to how they score?
[51:53.820 --> 51:54.800]  No, I'm just saying like
[51:54.800 --> 51:57.100]  if I watch a football game and it's
[51:57.100 --> 51:57.900]  like 2-1,
[51:58.800 --> 52:00.080]  the goals were like
[52:00.940 --> 52:02.280]  very exciting because
[52:02.760 --> 52:04.120]  there was a lot of time between them.
[52:05.060 --> 52:06.780]  But isn't it the result
[52:06.780 --> 52:08.840]  of the game that you're invested in more so
[52:08.840 --> 52:10.740]  than the mechanism of adding points?
[52:11.360 --> 52:12.760]  Like isn't that...
[52:12.760 --> 52:14.620]  I feel like that's more of a factor for me.
[52:15.740 --> 52:17.020]  Yeah. Would you play like a...
[52:17.020 --> 52:18.620]  Would you play a capture the flag
[52:18.620 --> 52:21.100]  on blood gulch first to 50?
[52:21.500 --> 52:22.660]  No, it'd be like...
[52:22.660 --> 52:24.500]  It's exciting when it's scored once.
[52:24.720 --> 52:26.820]  If every time I score once it's worth
[52:26.820 --> 52:28.100]  six, that might be interesting.
[52:28.580 --> 52:30.160]  Do I get the ability to go for eight?
[52:30.840 --> 52:32.780]  I gotta... Yeah, I don't know, man.
[52:33.660 --> 52:34.540]  Like I think the
[52:34.540 --> 52:36.740]  beauty of soccer and the allure of
[52:36.740 --> 52:38.600]  soccer is like the fluidity of motion
[52:38.600 --> 52:40.820]  and how the game plays out. And I think
[52:40.820 --> 52:42.960]  basketball is the exact same way.
[52:43.740 --> 52:44.700]  Like you're
[52:44.700 --> 52:45.700]  constantly watching
[52:47.920 --> 52:48.720]  the fluidity
[52:48.720 --> 52:50.620]  of the team, how a team
[52:50.620 --> 52:52.740]  will make a defensive response
[52:52.740 --> 52:54.800]  to something that another team is doing and then how that
[52:54.800 --> 52:56.260]  team counters it or doesn't it.
[52:56.520 --> 52:58.440]  It's constantly interesting.
[52:59.500 --> 53:00.600]  There's too much
[53:00.600 --> 53:02.460]  to watch on a screen. The thing I've
[53:02.460 --> 53:04.720]  had trouble with these finals is I want to watch them multiple
[53:04.720 --> 53:06.680]  times because I want to see what every player is doing
[53:07.800 --> 53:08.820]  in relation to everything
[53:08.820 --> 53:09.720]  else that's going on in the court.
[53:11.520 --> 53:12.700]  Basketball is non-stop
[53:12.700 --> 53:14.780]  interesting shit happening at all times. Fascinating.
[53:15.160 --> 53:16.180]  Not that we're in this era.
[53:16.360 --> 53:18.600]  It baffles me the idea of being like
[53:19.120 --> 53:20.900]  another dunk? They're dunking again.
[53:21.100 --> 53:22.420]  Okay. I'm not annoyed with it.
[53:22.720 --> 53:24.960]  It's like score over there, run it back, score over there.
[53:25.060 --> 53:26.860]  I know, but a dunk is always exciting
[53:26.860 --> 53:28.740]  to me. It doesn't matter how many times it happens.
[53:29.000 --> 53:30.620]  I went to a game with Geoff.
[53:30.720 --> 53:32.660]  It was very exciting. It was a very cool environment.
[53:33.320 --> 53:34.460]  I really had a good time.
[53:34.600 --> 53:36.760]  NBA finals game. In general, I don't think I
[53:36.760 --> 53:38.540]  could watch like 50
[53:38.540 --> 53:39.660]  games in a year.
[53:41.080 --> 53:42.640]  Well, a lot of people can't.
[53:44.740 --> 53:45.540]  Most people
[53:45.540 --> 53:47.300]  don't watch every game of their team.
[53:47.740 --> 53:48.640]  I wouldn't imagine.
[53:49.800 --> 53:51.420]  Oh, really? I don't think so.
[53:51.500 --> 53:53.480]  There's 82 games and then if you make it
[53:53.480 --> 53:54.420]  all the way to the...
[53:54.420 --> 53:57.340]  If you make it all the way through the playoffs
[53:57.340 --> 53:59.460]  to the finals, you're playing another quarter of a season.
[53:59.820 --> 54:01.420]  You're playing another 24 games.
[54:01.780 --> 54:03.640]  It depends on the sport. I will watch
[54:03.640 --> 54:05.700]  every Seahawks game every year
[54:05.700 --> 54:07.580]  because there's 16 of those and it's one
[54:07.580 --> 54:09.060]  a week. That's very manageable.
[54:09.500 --> 54:10.980]  When you get into hockey and
[54:12.380 --> 54:13.180]  basketball and
[54:13.940 --> 54:15.440]  baseball, it becomes more
[54:15.440 --> 54:17.040]  challenging. You have multiple games a week.
[54:17.600 --> 54:18.480]  I like the idea of playoffs.
[54:19.220 --> 54:21.200]  You play every team and then
[54:21.200 --> 54:22.260]  something happens.
[54:22.600 --> 54:24.520]  My limit is 82 games.
[54:25.040 --> 54:27.200]  Baseball, it's hard to keep up with a full season
[54:27.200 --> 54:29.480]  and try to watch every game, but I can watch every basketball game.
[54:29.680 --> 54:31.520]  82 is not too hard. The playoffs are always
[54:31.520 --> 54:33.500]  great for any sport. It's always
[54:33.500 --> 54:35.500]  exciting. Are we a sports podcast?
[54:35.500 --> 54:37.080]  I don't think that's right. No, we're a
[54:37.080 --> 54:38.980]  baseball equipment podcast.
[54:41.300 --> 54:41.840]  We're a
[54:41.840 --> 54:43.540]  time traveling baseball equipment podcast.
[54:43.560 --> 54:45.260]  I do! Yeah, so
[54:45.260 --> 54:47.480]  speaking of, we'll probably start wrapping
[54:47.480 --> 54:49.380]  it up here soon, but I've been meaning to ask you this
[54:49.380 --> 54:51.360]  for a while now, but has
[54:51.360 --> 54:53.660]  anybody experienced any new potential
[54:53.660 --> 54:54.420]  time travel
[54:55.500 --> 54:57.480]  issues? Has future you
[54:58.500 --> 54:59.380]  maybe manipulated
[54:59.380 --> 55:01.520]  your lives in any way recently that you can account for?
[55:01.560 --> 55:03.320]  Yeah, I realized today when you asked me about
[55:03.320 --> 55:05.320]  had I done the baseball video, I
[55:05.320 --> 55:07.380]  quickly went back in time and posted it in
[55:07.380 --> 55:09.320]  the Slack. That's fair.
[55:09.600 --> 55:11.360]  Yeah. Just so I wouldn't feel
[55:13.040 --> 55:13.560]  on the
[55:13.560 --> 55:14.260]  back foot there.
[55:15.840 --> 55:16.760]  Well, I don't think
[55:17.720 --> 55:19.560]  anything... I've had a pretty uneventful
[55:19.560 --> 55:21.480]  life the last week or two.
[55:22.620 --> 55:23.420]  I don't even
[55:23.420 --> 55:25.300]  know if I've talked about it, but I got my new bike and I've been
[55:25.300 --> 55:27.320]  riding it every day and nothing's happening.
[55:27.600 --> 55:29.360]  Everything's just like... Life's good though.
[55:29.600 --> 55:30.700]  Yeah, I guess so.
[55:30.700 --> 55:32.600]  Yeah, no, it is. You're right. It is. It is good.
[55:33.820 --> 55:34.800]  It's good for
[55:34.800 --> 55:36.260]  everything except for this podcast.
[55:36.440 --> 55:37.960]  With the exception of Emily getting
[55:38.680 --> 55:40.600]  COVID and us being quarantined for that week.
[55:41.460 --> 55:42.600]  It's been a pretty uneventful
[55:42.600 --> 55:44.620]  life. Yeah, I'd say that
[55:44.620 --> 55:47.120]  I'm at a point where I'm thinking about whippersnappers
[55:47.120 --> 55:48.680]  as a reflection of the
[55:48.680 --> 55:50.660]  thrill that is happening in my life at the moment.
[55:51.900 --> 55:52.800]  I'm having extended
[55:52.800 --> 55:54.620]  thoughts about what whippersnappers mean
[55:54.620 --> 55:56.940]  and the age limits. Probably not a lot going on.
[55:56.980 --> 55:58.640]  That's exciting. I want to buy
[55:58.640 --> 56:00.580]  you both a three pack of these
[56:00.580 --> 56:02.800]  new socks, by the way. I would love to have
[56:02.800 --> 56:04.640]  a pair. I'm excited. I want to see if any
[56:04.640 --> 56:06.640]  effect has any effect on your
[56:06.640 --> 56:08.420]  lives. Have you noticed...
[56:08.420 --> 56:10.940]  You know red is bad, but are the other...
[56:10.940 --> 56:12.440]  Is any other color particularly
[56:12.440 --> 56:14.080]  good? No.
[56:14.460 --> 56:16.680]  No, I'm trying not to get hung up on
[56:16.680 --> 56:18.200]  the intricacies of good.
[56:18.660 --> 56:20.500]  Just trying to avoid bad. I think
[56:20.500 --> 56:22.480]  this will be out by the time
[56:22.480 --> 56:24.600]  and if not, maybe we can edit. I think
[56:24.600 --> 56:26.580]  you'll know this, Geoff. The fact
[56:26.580 --> 56:28.580]  that Gavin and I are on Survive Block
[56:28.580 --> 56:30.640]  Island Season 2, which is like Survivor
[56:30.640 --> 56:32.620]  meets Minecraft. Yes. If I could get
[56:32.620 --> 56:34.560]  a pair of those socks, Gavin, if I
[56:34.560 --> 56:36.720]  get voted out first, I'm wearing those fucking socks,
[56:36.780 --> 56:37.620]  we're going to have a problem.
[56:38.200 --> 56:40.200]  I love that the other day...
[56:40.200 --> 56:42.100]  This is actually funny. I forgot about this.
[56:42.960 --> 56:44.740]  Andrew accidentally texted me some stuff
[56:44.740 --> 56:46.380]  he meant to send to you,
[56:46.560 --> 56:48.820]  Gavin, about like scheming
[56:48.820 --> 56:50.540]  for Survive Block Island
[56:50.540 --> 56:51.800]  and I was like,
[56:52.460 --> 56:54.380]  you probably shouldn't be telling me this stuff. And he's like,
[56:54.380 --> 56:56.420]  are you on the show? And I was
[56:56.420 --> 56:58.220]  like, no, I'm not in the show. And he's like, oh,
[56:58.240 --> 57:00.700]  just disregard it. But I'm producing it. I helped make it.
[57:00.800 --> 57:02.260]  I'm going to be watching in the control room
[57:02.260 --> 57:04.260]  everything that you're doing and now I know
[57:04.260 --> 57:06.040]  your dumb plans so I can
[57:06.600 --> 57:08.500]  make sure to catch them.
[57:08.640 --> 57:10.380]  To clarify my plan. Yeah, the plan
[57:10.380 --> 57:12.540]  was just the fact that neither of us have capture
[57:12.540 --> 57:14.400]  cards for our computer and I don't know if we
[57:14.400 --> 57:16.240]  need those. And the premise of
[57:16.240 --> 57:18.440]  part of the story just not being
[57:18.440 --> 57:20.300]  present because neither of us are capturing
[57:20.300 --> 57:22.280]  what is happening. Do we make that at home?
[57:22.280 --> 57:24.420]  Where do we film it? Yeah, you guys film from home.
[57:24.740 --> 57:25.760]  Oh, I can't film from home.
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.220]  You can't film a PC game
[57:28.220 --> 57:30.440]  on Steam? No, I've like rearranged
[57:31.320 --> 57:32.340]  I've trashed this set.
[57:32.740 --> 57:34.360]  Well, you might have to come in for it then.
[57:34.980 --> 57:35.620]  Well, alright.
[57:36.560 --> 57:38.180]  So wait, do you need a capture card?
[57:38.760 --> 57:39.940]  No, you just need to be able to
[57:39.940 --> 57:42.120]  Do you have OBS? No,
[57:42.320 --> 57:44.440]  I'll figure it out. It's just a PC game
[57:44.440 --> 57:46.120]  and you just have to be able to record PC footage.
[57:46.560 --> 57:47.680]  You don't need a capture card for that.
[57:48.140 --> 57:50.100]  Got it. Well, we're going to be in that and
[57:50.440 --> 57:51.920]  I'm not going to backstab you, Gavin.
[57:52.200 --> 57:53.020]  Promise. Make you swear.
[57:53.640 --> 57:53.960]  Ugh.
[57:55.460 --> 57:57.980]  I was simultaneously filled with joy and dread
[57:57.980 --> 57:59.720]  when you said you were going to be on it. Really?
[58:00.020 --> 58:01.960]  I was just excited. And for the brief moment
[58:01.960 --> 58:03.520]  I thought Geoff was on it. I was like,
[58:03.860 --> 58:06.280]  this is great. I'm going to send you so many socks.
[58:06.620 --> 58:07.840]  I can't be on it. I know
[58:08.280 --> 58:09.700]  all the stuff.
[58:10.080 --> 58:11.980]  It'd be unfair. This was fun.
[58:12.060 --> 58:13.680]  I'm glad we did too. We learned a lot.
[58:13.920 --> 58:15.680]  We got the videos that are coming out.
[58:15.940 --> 58:17.220]  Got to talk about that we're doing that.
[58:17.220 --> 58:18.640]  Gavin hates scoring.
[58:18.860 --> 58:19.900]  This was a good episode.
[58:22.360 --> 58:23.440]  That was a good one.
[58:23.640 --> 58:25.240]  Was it this episode?
[58:25.880 --> 58:27.580]  Was it this episode or last episode
[58:27.580 --> 58:29.300]  that we discovered Gavin was going to make
[58:29.300 --> 58:30.920]  the pizza? The Branson pickle pizza?
[58:30.920 --> 58:33.060]  This episode. Oh yeah, it's a great episode then.
[58:33.140 --> 58:35.040]  It's a great episode. Yeah, we got a whole new recipe.
[58:35.040 --> 58:36.380]  It happened like 20 minutes ago.
[58:37.960 --> 58:38.640]  That's awesome.
[58:39.740 --> 58:40.100]  A++.
[58:40.740 --> 58:43.140]  Why don't one or two of you watch that freaking video and then we'll upload it.
[58:43.140 --> 58:45.320]  I'm so excited. Please upload the file as soon as we're done.
[58:45.320 --> 58:46.700]  Could you
[58:47.380 --> 58:48.520]  send us the
[58:50.300 --> 58:51.180]  other video?
[58:51.900 --> 58:53.500]  Yeah, but also watch baseballs
[58:53.500 --> 58:55.520]  for Christ's sake. I will. I'll watch both of them.
[58:55.620 --> 58:56.200]  Can't wait.
[58:57.240 --> 58:58.500]  How long is it?
[58:59.140 --> 59:00.960]  Just off the top of your head. I don't remember.
[59:01.600 --> 59:02.340]  Let me see.
[59:02.940 --> 59:04.000]  Here's my note.
[59:05.320 --> 59:06.360]  It's probably too long.
[59:07.400 --> 59:08.660]  Let me see. I'm looking it up right now.
[59:08.960 --> 59:11.360]  It is nine and a half minutes.
[59:11.780 --> 59:13.280]  Oh yeah, that's a seven minute
[59:13.280 --> 59:14.340]  video, Max, probably.
[59:15.720 --> 59:16.620]  Thanks for your feedback.
[59:16.980 --> 59:17.400]  No problem.
[59:19.300 --> 59:20.320]  Happy to help.
[59:22.720 --> 59:23.080]  Okay.
[59:23.220 --> 59:25.180]  I guess I should stop it. Nobody else is going to do it.
[59:25.420 --> 59:26.260]  Thanks for listening
[59:27.040 --> 59:29.360]  to another episode of the...
[59:29.360 --> 59:31.240]  You started it. This is your thing.
[59:31.320 --> 59:32.080]  This is what you do.
[59:32.660 --> 59:34.720]  Yeah, that's fine. I was saying that.
[59:34.880 --> 59:36.260]  Nobody else is going to do it, so I better do it.
[59:36.440 --> 59:37.760]  This is what you do.
[59:38.860 --> 59:39.920]  I'm not arguing with you.
[59:39.920 --> 59:42.020]  Is this the final version of the intro
[59:42.020 --> 59:43.300]  or the outro, or are there going to be notes?
[59:44.820 --> 59:45.740]  I'll be honest,
[59:45.800 --> 59:46.820]  it's too long.
[59:48.860 --> 59:49.680]  The end.
[59:52.280 --> 59:54.020]  Hey guys, MajorLeagueFan
[59:54.020 --> 59:55.900]  Jack here with a look at next week's episode
[59:55.900 --> 59:57.840]  of F*** Face. Nick screwed up
[59:57.840 --> 59:59.960]  the secret. Gavin gets his movies
[59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.820]  wrong. What is Eric's limit?
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:03.760]  You're going to find out what all the
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.860]  beeping was about. Gavin and Geoff have the
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:07.900]  wettest of fives. Water and
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:10.140]  laptops do not mix. Geoff
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.060]  is an excellent diver. And once
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:13.800]  again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:15.980]  All that and more on next week's episode
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:16.840]  of F*** Face.
