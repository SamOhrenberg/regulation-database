[00:15.080 --> 00:19.260]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:20.060 --> 00:24.380]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Pantin and Gavin Frey,
[00:25.060 --> 00:27.280]  neither of whom are American.
[00:27.620 --> 00:28.520]  Just thought I'd throw that out there.
[00:28.840 --> 00:38.340]  This is episode 100, episode 111 of season four, year three, volume one.
[00:38.740 --> 00:40.080]  I have a question. Yeah.
[00:40.720 --> 00:46.600]  Um, well, I sort of opened Discord maybe 10 minutes ago and there was no one in here.
[00:46.680 --> 00:50.340]  So I'm wondering, did we have some extremely short pleasantries again?
[00:50.580 --> 00:52.240]  Dude, let me tell you about the pleasantries.
[00:53.020 --> 00:53.780]  Go ahead, Geoff.
[00:53.800 --> 00:57.960]  I logged in. I logged in. I saw Andrew and Nick were already in.
[00:58.100 --> 01:00.480]  So I hopped in at 2.57 to have pleasantries.
[01:00.620 --> 01:02.940]  And I hopped in and the first thing I heard Andrew say is,
[01:03.240 --> 01:06.760]  and that's the end of that conversation. We'll pick this up at a later date.
[01:07.840 --> 01:10.100]  Oh, this is, um, this is a weird one.
[01:10.140 --> 01:11.460]  This is not on our normal day.
[01:11.540 --> 01:14.380]  This is almost an emergency f*** face meeting.
[01:15.940 --> 01:17.660]  Dude, not only is it...
[01:17.660 --> 01:22.640]  Yeah, and I was telling Andrew before, I have so f***ing much to talk about.
[01:22.720 --> 01:23.800]  Gavin, you know about a lot of it.
[01:24.380 --> 01:26.840]  There's one thing that happened to me this morning that you don't know about, though.
[01:27.540 --> 01:31.400]  I have so much to f***ing talk about, but all I care about is a tuxedo.
[01:31.480 --> 01:32.960]  So I'm just going to list my notes.
[01:33.040 --> 01:34.440]  And then if we get to them, we get to them.
[01:34.440 --> 01:35.660]  At least they're on the page.
[01:36.040 --> 01:37.160]  At least they're on the recording.
[01:37.400 --> 01:38.560]  And so I'll remember to get back to them someday.
[01:38.920 --> 01:40.500]  So I'm going to say, here's my notes real fast.
[01:41.120 --> 01:41.480]  Bootstamp.
[01:42.220 --> 01:42.920]  Fart movie.
[01:43.420 --> 01:44.140]  New laptop.
[01:44.760 --> 01:45.400]  Hi, Disney.
[01:45.700 --> 01:46.300]  Bye, Disney.
[01:46.860 --> 01:48.080]  Hi-C's high five.
[01:48.740 --> 01:49.860]  Gavin doorbell dream.
[01:49.980 --> 01:51.060]  Oh, that's another one you don't know about, Gavin.
[01:53.040 --> 01:54.660]  Wrecked car gets wrecked.
[01:55.600 --> 01:57.820]  And prepare to yell at Andrew about tuxedo.
[01:57.920 --> 02:00.600]  So, Andrew, let's get into the tuxedo.
[02:01.000 --> 02:01.760]  Go right to the...
[02:01.760 --> 02:04.020]  Well, before we get the tuxedo, I just want Gavin to know
[02:04.020 --> 02:06.560]  it was a shorter pleasantry period.
[02:06.640 --> 02:08.320]  And I was very stressed about that.
[02:08.780 --> 02:09.420]  I was getting ready.
[02:09.620 --> 02:14.460]  Hop in for some quality pleasantries at like 12.47 my time.
[02:14.540 --> 02:15.380]  I was like, you know what?
[02:15.440 --> 02:16.300]  Got to use the bathroom.
[02:16.560 --> 02:17.400]  So I went to use the bathroom.
[02:17.820 --> 02:19.620]  It was a larger bathroom trip than I anticipated.
[02:20.120 --> 02:20.880]  Thought it was fast...
[02:20.880 --> 02:22.180]  You showered in your pleasantries, didn't you?
[02:22.340 --> 02:23.520]  It was a real problem.
[02:23.640 --> 02:25.300]  I was sitting on the toilet, looking at the clock like,
[02:25.380 --> 02:26.820]  I'm running out of pleasantry time.
[02:26.900 --> 02:29.940]  I want to talk to Nick about some things before Geoff gets here.
[02:29.960 --> 02:31.420]  And he typically gets here five minutes before.
[02:31.420 --> 02:34.420]  Were you opposed to joining the Discord from the toilet?
[02:34.640 --> 02:36.360]  Just to have pleasantries with Nick through your phone?
[02:37.020 --> 02:40.060]  Not opposed to it, but it didn't occur to me.
[02:40.200 --> 02:42.560]  I was thinking about all the things that I need to discuss,
[02:42.680 --> 02:44.680]  because a lot has happened since we...
[02:44.680 --> 02:45.660]  First of all, the tuxedo.
[02:46.320 --> 02:48.980]  Why did we bleep that in the most recent episode?
[02:49.060 --> 02:50.640]  That was the thing that was bleeped a million times.
[02:50.760 --> 02:52.300]  I don't understand why we did that.
[02:52.460 --> 02:53.240]  Why did we do that?
[02:53.360 --> 02:53.800]  You're an idiot.
[02:54.440 --> 02:56.060]  You're such a stupid bastard.
[02:56.680 --> 02:57.460]  What do you mean?
[02:57.920 --> 02:59.440]  I don't understand how this is my fault.
[02:59.440 --> 03:02.940]  That came out before the freaking auction.
[03:03.180 --> 03:05.580]  And that's the exact conversation I was trying to have with you,
[03:05.660 --> 03:08.480]  where you were like, oh, we don't have clearance to land.
[03:08.580 --> 03:10.640]  I was like, that episode hasn't come out yet.
[03:10.900 --> 03:12.340]  We still have time to bleep it.
[03:12.560 --> 03:16.040]  What's amazing to me is that when I proofed it, there weren't any bleeps.
[03:16.320 --> 03:18.240]  So I don't know when it got bleeped.
[03:18.280 --> 03:22.100]  There was a missing bleep and a tuxedo came out.
[03:22.560 --> 03:24.120]  Yeah, but it didn't come out hard.
[03:24.200 --> 03:26.420]  It only came out to the people who were paying extra attention.
[03:26.780 --> 03:27.620]  It was like an extra...
[03:27.620 --> 03:34.700]  So the tuxedo itself ended up being one of the last items in that block of auction period.
[03:34.780 --> 03:35.740]  So it was on Thursday.
[03:36.060 --> 03:37.580]  The auction started on Tuesday.
[03:38.220 --> 03:40.740]  The tuxedo aspect of it happened on a Thursday.
[03:41.240 --> 03:44.000]  But it takes like several days to make your account for it.
[03:44.020 --> 03:45.740]  So that's why I didn't get why it was bleeped.
[03:45.740 --> 03:49.380]  Because even if it was before, unless somebody already had an account,
[03:49.500 --> 03:51.120]  it just felt like a niche thing.
[03:51.640 --> 03:52.960]  So I didn't know why that happened.
[03:53.160 --> 03:55.780]  But I guess you were saying it shouldn't have been bleeped
[03:55.780 --> 03:57.660]  because it takes so long to get an account.
[03:57.720 --> 04:02.380]  Yeah, like even though possibly the auction could have happened if our lot was on Tuesday.
[04:02.500 --> 04:03.980]  I didn't realize how it worked at the time.
[04:04.280 --> 04:06.560]  But also it takes several days to like get approved.
[04:06.660 --> 04:08.760]  You have to get you have to send in a lot of stuff.
[04:08.980 --> 04:09.660]  It's a whole process.
[04:09.820 --> 04:11.000]  It takes you several days.
[04:11.060 --> 04:13.520]  Who knows if it takes an average person several days.
[04:13.640 --> 04:14.720]  No, it takes everybody.
[04:14.940 --> 04:16.880]  You have to supply some more info.
[04:17.280 --> 04:19.320]  He said only on first for a few hours.
[04:19.400 --> 04:22.920]  Unfortunately, Eric made the call on the day we turned in the final version.
[04:23.040 --> 04:24.600]  So it was a mad dash to edit.
[04:24.600 --> 04:28.400]  So Eric said day of it needs to be bleeped.
[04:28.400 --> 04:28.980]  Is that what you're saying?
[04:29.500 --> 04:30.040]  I guess so.
[04:30.560 --> 04:31.540]  Based on what Nick said.
[04:31.580 --> 04:34.560]  Well, I will say people seemed to really like the bleeps.
[04:34.840 --> 04:35.180]  Day before.
[04:35.580 --> 04:36.600]  They liked the bleeps?
[04:36.740 --> 04:40.240]  Yeah, they thought it was they thought it was like so so bleepy.
[04:40.320 --> 04:41.240]  It was comical.
[04:42.180 --> 04:43.460]  Because we were talking about it.
[04:43.620 --> 04:47.520]  The reason it was bleeped the week before was because we didn't know whether we're going to
[04:47.520 --> 04:47.940]  talk about it.
[04:48.160 --> 04:52.280]  What we discussed in that one is that it is now fine to talk about.
[04:52.280 --> 04:55.040]  And then after that, we realized Andrew's done the math wrong.
[04:55.400 --> 04:56.940]  No, my math was correct.
[04:57.040 --> 04:57.720]  That's what I'm arguing.
[04:57.840 --> 04:58.980]  I don't know why we did this wrong.
[04:59.500 --> 05:01.340]  Well, you know, you're yelling at me.
[05:01.420 --> 05:03.920]  It's very possible I did, but I don't think we needed the bleeps.
[05:04.080 --> 05:05.560]  I think it doesn't matter.
[05:05.800 --> 05:06.580]  Get away from bleeps.
[05:06.800 --> 05:07.360]  I just don't.
[05:07.480 --> 05:11.660]  They were by the way, just just for the audience that is desperately trying to understand what
[05:11.660 --> 05:12.580]  the fuck is going on.
[05:13.220 --> 05:17.740]  This is the Jackie Chan tuxedo from the movie Tuxedo that we were going to buy at auction.
[05:17.860 --> 05:22.260]  We got Rooster Teeth to agree to let us spend up to three thousand dollars to buy the tuxedo
[05:22.260 --> 05:24.740]  they expected to go for two thousand dollars.
[05:25.140 --> 05:27.940]  And then we put it in Andrew's incredibly capable hands.
[05:28.380 --> 05:32.440]  And I knew in the moment we agreed to do that, it was a mistake.
[05:33.580 --> 05:37.860]  So when I was, I feel like I was the one that was pushing for this idea the hardest.
[05:38.220 --> 05:42.580]  And I thought it would be so funny for us all to watch the auction together and we could
[05:42.580 --> 05:46.220]  bid on it and go through the highs and the lows of trying to secure it.
[05:46.620 --> 05:47.880]  That was my vision for it.
[05:48.220 --> 05:51.460]  Literally every other person involved with the show was out.
[05:51.460 --> 05:52.340]  They were away.
[05:52.480 --> 05:54.560]  So it was just me by myself.
[05:55.160 --> 06:00.620]  And that was terrifying because I got given the Eric card, which by myself is a lot of
[06:00.620 --> 06:01.240]  responsibility.
[06:01.240 --> 06:03.440]  It was very terrifying to add that to my account.
[06:03.580 --> 06:09.460]  I had an all time dumb moment where Eric sent me the card as two images, like the front
[06:09.460 --> 06:10.560]  of the card or the back of the card.
[06:10.720 --> 06:16.220]  And he sent me the photo of the front and I was putting that in and I instinctually grabbed
[06:16.220 --> 06:19.960]  my phone and looked at the back of it to put in the bottom, the back of the card.
[06:19.960 --> 06:21.460]  Like I didn't swap photos.
[06:21.580 --> 06:25.200]  I'm so used to like looking at a card and then just twisting it over for the verification
[06:25.200 --> 06:25.660]  number.
[06:25.800 --> 06:27.940]  I physically looked at the back of my phone.
[06:28.340 --> 06:29.220]  So that's a great start.
[06:30.380 --> 06:34.380]  Then I went into the auction because this is Tuesday and our lot is until Thursday.
[06:34.520 --> 06:36.820]  And I thought, I've never like experienced this before.
[06:37.140 --> 06:41.840]  It could be fun to just kind of get a feel for it and see what like maybe I can learn
[06:41.840 --> 06:43.080]  a strategy from this.
[06:43.340 --> 06:45.140]  And so I'm not really paying attention.
[06:45.140 --> 06:51.000]  And the item up is like some outfit from Star Trek, like one of the Star Trek shows, and
[06:51.000 --> 06:56.880]  it's expected to go between like $600 to like $1,000 or something like that.
[06:56.940 --> 07:02.320]  And I looked and it was currently at $20,000 was the bid active.
[07:02.440 --> 07:03.980]  And I wasn't really paying attention.
[07:04.240 --> 07:10.040]  Then I thought I bumped my keyboard and I was convinced that I placed a $25,000 bid on
[07:10.040 --> 07:11.520]  a piece of Star Trek memorabilia.
[07:11.680 --> 07:13.160]  So that was terrifying.
[07:13.420 --> 07:14.200]  I thought I died.
[07:14.200 --> 07:16.300]  I had to quadruple check, make sure I was all good.
[07:16.400 --> 07:16.960]  That was fine.
[07:17.260 --> 07:17.840]  Void that.
[07:18.400 --> 07:20.340]  So then I was scared to even open the auction.
[07:20.720 --> 07:21.280]  I have a question.
[07:21.580 --> 07:21.800]  Tuxedo time.
[07:21.980 --> 07:22.300]  Go ahead.
[07:23.140 --> 07:25.400]  My headphones went off for about two straight minutes there.
[07:25.460 --> 07:25.860]  What did I miss?
[07:29.220 --> 07:33.660]  Andrew Mayer may not have accidentally bid $22,000 on a Star Trek outfit.
[07:34.160 --> 07:35.960]  OK, so we're not at the tuxedo yet.
[07:36.420 --> 07:37.040]  No, no, no.
[07:37.240 --> 07:37.600]  OK, sorry.
[07:37.840 --> 07:38.000]  All right.
[07:38.120 --> 07:39.620]  Before we get to the tuxedo, I just want.
[07:40.040 --> 07:41.120]  How would you guys feel?
[07:41.180 --> 07:43.220]  I'm just hypothetically throwing this out there.
[07:43.220 --> 07:47.060]  How would you feel instead of if we got the tuxedo?
[07:47.400 --> 07:52.540]  We had like a variety of maybe smaller items that were kind of show related.
[07:53.120 --> 07:57.400]  It fit as just I wanted to read on that because I was told I could spend to the cap.
[07:57.760 --> 08:02.740]  So if we had extra money after the tuxedo or if we just missed entirely,
[08:02.820 --> 08:04.980]  I could still try to acquire things.
[08:05.180 --> 08:06.980]  Well, I just know I wouldn't.
[08:07.180 --> 08:12.000]  I wouldn't say it was any any hint of of approval for that.
[08:12.000 --> 08:13.660]  No, I asked for it and I got approval.
[08:13.940 --> 08:15.000]  I didn't. I talked.
[08:15.000 --> 08:18.620]  I would say it's not worth spending the money on smaller things that
[08:19.120 --> 08:22.320]  we're not as passionate about unless it's something that really fits.
[08:22.680 --> 08:25.980]  Like the only thing I was interested in was the tuxedo.
[08:26.180 --> 08:28.760]  So I guess it would, yeah, it would depend on what the other stuff is.
[08:29.040 --> 08:30.020]  So there's a variety.
[08:30.160 --> 08:33.860]  I put some of them in the chat they made for the Fast and Furious movie.
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.820]  A Dom Toretto license with Shrek on it for some reason.
[08:36.960 --> 08:37.900]  I thought that was great.
[08:37.900 --> 08:40.920]  They were actually auctioned off the bowling hat,
[08:41.080 --> 08:44.640]  pins and balls from the bowling scene and the Flintstones movie.
[08:45.020 --> 08:46.120]  It's like that show specific.
[08:47.240 --> 08:50.860]  The thing I was most excited about is right after the tuxedo
[08:50.860 --> 08:55.120]  was the baseball outfit from the Twilight movie and the baseball scene,
[08:55.260 --> 08:57.320]  which is a great one of the greatest scenes in that whole series.
[08:57.500 --> 08:59.040]  We're kind of a baseball show.
[08:59.180 --> 09:00.460]  So I thought we had room.
[09:00.500 --> 09:01.920]  We're not really a Twilight show.
[09:02.520 --> 09:06.880]  No, but I mean, we're kind of a baseball show and it's an iconic baseball podcast.
[09:06.880 --> 09:08.780]  Yeah, and that's a baseball equipment.
[09:08.940 --> 09:10.740]  I'd say uniform and all that.
[09:12.340 --> 09:14.660]  Um, so it got to auction day.
[09:14.760 --> 09:18.400]  I made I made a strategic decision on this.
[09:19.060 --> 09:20.380]  What are you laughing at, Geoff?
[09:20.780 --> 09:21.780]  I fucking hate you.
[09:22.100 --> 09:22.840]  Why do you hate me?
[09:22.860 --> 09:23.840]  I'm just telling you what happened.
[09:24.060 --> 09:24.920]  He's a son of a bitch.
[09:25.020 --> 09:28.660]  If this doesn't end, if this doesn't end in us getting that fucking tuxedo
[09:28.660 --> 09:31.460]  and we end up with the goddamn Twilight merchandise.
[09:31.800 --> 09:34.020]  Thousands of dollars on something else, haven't you?
[09:34.080 --> 09:34.640]  That's what you've done.
[09:34.720 --> 09:36.040]  No, I'm not saying any.
[09:36.040 --> 09:37.560]  I'm just trying to get to where we're at.
[09:37.560 --> 09:40.340]  So I, I made a realization.
[09:40.740 --> 09:44.160]  I did my research because I was the only one that showed up and it was my responsibility.
[09:44.340 --> 09:46.980]  I was told strictly cannot go over 3K.
[09:47.380 --> 09:49.200]  That's the max, not a penny over.
[09:49.480 --> 09:51.280]  Does it mean go to 3K?
[09:51.820 --> 09:53.080]  No, it's not what I did.
[09:53.160 --> 09:54.680]  You're just making assumptions of what happened.
[09:54.800 --> 09:57.740]  So I made the choice because Gavin...
[09:57.740 --> 09:59.620]  Before you tell us, are we going to...
[09:59.620 --> 10:01.800]  Do you predict we're going to be pleased with what you've done or not?
[10:03.200 --> 10:03.600]  I...
[10:03.600 --> 10:05.340]  No spoilers for that.
[10:05.340 --> 10:06.980]  But let me ask you, let me ask you a question.
[10:07.100 --> 10:07.740]  Let me ask you a question.
[10:07.860 --> 10:08.160]  Go ahead.
[10:08.920 --> 10:09.920]  Am I going to have to...
[10:09.920 --> 10:13.780]  Am I going to have to use my founder card to smooth stuff over after this?
[10:14.240 --> 10:15.220]  I don't think so.
[10:15.740 --> 10:18.560]  For a split second, I thought that was a special credit card that you have.
[10:20.080 --> 10:21.200]  Well, I do have...
[10:21.200 --> 10:25.700]  I am a member of the founders club, which does give you a card, which gives you discounts on hotels.
[10:25.900 --> 10:30.880]  But this is more like, uh, founded the company and I can get us out of a jam if I need to.
[10:31.140 --> 10:31.260]  Right.
[10:31.280 --> 10:32.440]  I really hate doing that though.
[10:32.440 --> 10:34.040]  No, no, I would...
[10:34.040 --> 10:37.520]  If I would have spent $30,000 on Star Trek merchandise though, I would expect you to
[10:37.520 --> 10:39.320]  use the founder card to literally murder me.
[10:39.460 --> 10:40.240]  That would be fine.
[10:40.280 --> 10:41.900]  I'd approve that, that decision.
[10:43.480 --> 10:48.720]  But so what I learned in the auction is that there's a minimum bid and then there's their
[10:48.720 --> 10:50.300]  projected windows for bids.
[10:50.380 --> 10:54.320]  And I think Gavin, you've said that you've used the site before, so maybe you know about this.
[10:54.380 --> 10:54.720]  I don't know.
[10:54.980 --> 10:59.760]  But essentially the minimum bid is below what their lowest expected amount is.
[10:59.760 --> 11:05.060]  But unless the bid hits the lowest expected amount, they will not sell you the item.
[11:05.480 --> 11:07.360]  They will just not offer it to you.
[11:07.800 --> 11:08.660]  So I think...
[11:08.660 --> 11:09.120]  Because of the amount.
[11:09.160 --> 11:09.660]  Lowest.
[11:09.860 --> 11:10.420]  Exactly.
[11:10.620 --> 11:17.540]  So I think the lowest bid you could place on the tuxedo was $1,000, but their lowest
[11:17.540 --> 11:20.360]  entry point to buy it was $2,000.
[11:20.840 --> 11:21.960]  Now there's also fees.
[11:22.020 --> 11:26.480]  There's like 30% in like additional charges based on how much your bid is.
[11:26.780 --> 11:28.580]  And then there's taxes and there's shipping.
[11:28.580 --> 11:34.180]  So I did the math and I determined that essentially the most we could spend is $2,000,
[11:34.420 --> 11:37.400]  which is the floor for getting the tuxedo.
[11:37.660 --> 11:40.540]  I would have paid the extra if you would have texted me.
[11:40.960 --> 11:42.920]  I was told specifically...
[11:42.920 --> 11:45.720]  Last time I warned you that we would need more than that.
[11:45.800 --> 11:47.040]  Yeah, and that we all agreed.
[11:47.160 --> 11:48.020]  Gavin and I both agreed.
[11:48.120 --> 11:49.040]  We said we'd put money in.
[11:49.060 --> 11:50.480]  Well, you weren't there, first of all.
[11:50.560 --> 11:51.560]  And second of all...
[11:51.560 --> 11:52.540]  I'm always a text away.
[11:52.740 --> 11:53.680]  I'm always a text away.
[11:53.720 --> 11:57.660]  I was told specifically not to cross $3,000.
[11:57.660 --> 11:59.580]  Your issues with Eric, it is not with me.
[11:59.740 --> 12:01.560]  I was told to not cross $3,000.
[12:01.720 --> 12:03.100]  So I put $2,000 in.
[12:03.620 --> 12:06.620]  And then I asked Nick if he wanted to do the auction with me.
[12:06.640 --> 12:07.500]  And even he was busy.
[12:07.600 --> 12:09.120]  It's something going on at that exact time.
[12:09.460 --> 12:11.800]  So I recorded and Nick captured the video of it.
[12:11.860 --> 12:17.200]  We have the 17 minutes going into the tuxedo and the tuxedo itself.
[12:17.560 --> 12:22.580]  And we had the minimal bid that we could possibly have to get it.
[12:22.600 --> 12:26.600]  If anyone, if a single person would bid a cent over us,
[12:26.600 --> 12:29.180]  I could not counter that based on what my instructions were.
[12:29.780 --> 12:31.160]  And we got to the tuxedo.
[12:31.240 --> 12:33.700]  Dude, you've done some interpolation with those instructions.
[12:34.000 --> 12:37.100]  Nobody said anything about shipping costs and taxes stuff.
[12:37.180 --> 12:39.500]  We just told you to spend $3,000 on the damn tuxedo.
[12:39.600 --> 12:40.600]  You were not part of...
[12:40.600 --> 12:42.080]  We would have worked the rest out.
[12:42.240 --> 12:45.220]  Geoff, dictionary kid, shut up for a minute.
[12:45.560 --> 12:50.060]  I'm talking about conversations I had with somebody else that wasn't you.
[12:50.360 --> 12:51.400]  These were instructions I was given.
[12:51.400 --> 12:53.200]  I think Andrew's actually been very responsible here.
[12:53.740 --> 12:56.200]  I've been so responsible, you're just yelling at me for no reason.
[12:56.200 --> 13:00.340]  So I put the bid in, and I watched in fear by myself,
[13:00.460 --> 13:02.380]  because nobody else was around, in terror.
[13:03.080 --> 13:06.480]  And I'm delighted to say that we own the fucking tuxedo.
[13:06.500 --> 13:07.960]  I finalized it today.
[13:08.740 --> 13:09.740]  We got it.
[13:09.920 --> 13:13.300]  Not a single person bid on it.
[13:13.300 --> 13:13.980]  No one wanted it.
[13:14.080 --> 13:15.280]  Oh my god.
[13:16.500 --> 13:17.000]  We have it.
[13:17.160 --> 13:19.100]  That is the best news ever.
[13:20.600 --> 13:21.640]  Dude, congratulations.
[13:22.500 --> 13:25.400]  Andrew, you've taken something, you took it on your own,
[13:25.400 --> 13:26.660]  and you nailed it.
[13:26.720 --> 13:27.720]  That never happens.
[13:28.020 --> 13:30.660]  Andrew, I gotta say, I believed in you from the start.
[13:30.840 --> 13:32.280]  I knew you were gonna pull this off.
[13:32.460 --> 13:35.000]  I was just telling Eric the other day, we were in California together,
[13:35.080 --> 13:36.560]  I was like, trust in Andrew.
[13:36.860 --> 13:37.900]  You always gotta trust in Andrew.
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.540]  He'll never steer you wrong 100% of the time.
[13:40.880 --> 13:42.180]  Oh my god, that's amazing.
[13:42.700 --> 13:43.480]  So it was terrifying.
[13:43.780 --> 13:47.000]  And as I said, I don't know if we're gonna release it or what it will look like,
[13:47.060 --> 13:50.440]  but there's 17 minutes of me reacting to items in the auction,
[13:50.860 --> 13:53.220]  and then watching it happen live.
[13:53.220 --> 13:59.040]  And the auctioneer wanted so badly for any other action from anyone.
[13:59.440 --> 14:00.180]  He was desperate.
[14:00.600 --> 14:02.540]  He was like, I would just wear this out.
[14:02.860 --> 14:03.960]  This is a great tuxedo.
[14:04.240 --> 14:05.220]  This is fantastic.
[14:05.740 --> 14:06.360]  Go on once.
[14:06.560 --> 14:07.460]  This is a great tux.
[14:07.580 --> 14:08.860]  Everyone, look at how great this...
[14:08.860 --> 14:10.040]  Jackie Chan wore this.
[14:10.180 --> 14:10.460]  Go on twice.
[14:10.460 --> 14:12.820]  That's cheaper than a lot of tuxedos.
[14:13.160 --> 14:14.120]  I looked at it.
[14:14.440 --> 14:15.200]  It's cheaper.
[14:15.440 --> 14:16.240]  Well, it's not cheaper.
[14:16.360 --> 14:22.520]  It's like $700 more than buying an Armani tux from New, correct?
[14:22.520 --> 14:22.900]  Yeah.
[14:23.400 --> 14:24.500]  It's not that much of a difference.
[14:24.660 --> 14:25.960]  We got a savings.
[14:26.240 --> 14:27.120]  We got the full outfit.
[14:27.260 --> 14:29.500]  We got a shirt that has harness holes in the back of it.
[14:29.620 --> 14:31.800]  We're missing a few buttons, but we can make it work.
[14:31.980 --> 14:34.920]  Can you imagine buying that tuxedo just at a store,
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.520]  and then they offer you a $700 upgrade to Jackie Chan's one?
[14:38.620 --> 14:39.480]  You would do it, right?
[14:39.700 --> 14:41.080]  It's not that much more.
[14:45.160 --> 14:48.060]  I love the idea of them offering that as an option of like,
[14:48.080 --> 14:49.100]  okay, so you could get this one,
[14:49.280 --> 14:52.200]  or Jackie Chan has worn this $700 more.
[14:52.200 --> 14:53.000]  What do you think?
[14:53.420 --> 14:58.540]  Jackie Chan did Kung Fu in that tuxedo.
[14:58.620 --> 14:59.820]  And we own it now.
[15:00.020 --> 15:00.280]  Yeah.
[15:00.660 --> 15:02.140]  And we own the one from the movie.
[15:02.140 --> 15:05.320]  And it's not even a situation where it sounds like there were multiples.
[15:05.560 --> 15:06.600]  Like, this was the one.
[15:06.800 --> 15:07.720]  This is what they used.
[15:07.840 --> 15:08.900]  This is the fucking thing.
[15:09.420 --> 15:11.740]  So that was exciting and terrifying.
[15:11.860 --> 15:15.920]  I was just sweating, yelling, like, fucking hit the gavel.
[15:16.240 --> 15:16.560]  Hit it!
[15:16.980 --> 15:19.640]  Cause it's like, why are you stalling?
[15:19.880 --> 15:20.260]  Why?
[15:20.260 --> 15:22.360]  Like, he kept stretching it out.
[15:22.580 --> 15:23.300]  Dude, we had to.
[15:23.820 --> 15:24.920]  It was very exciting.
[15:25.740 --> 15:29.080]  I had had it in my head that we were going to end up with like,
[15:29.280 --> 15:34.540]  a catcher's mitt from Twilight and Dominic Toretto's Shrek driver's license.
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.340]  And I just wanted, in my head, I'd already worked through it.
[15:37.500 --> 15:39.080]  We were just going to put it on display,
[15:39.220 --> 15:40.660]  just like we were going to do with the tuxedo.
[15:40.840 --> 15:42.760]  But it was just going to be like in a glass case,
[15:42.800 --> 15:45.140]  all bundled together that just said, not the tuxedo.
[15:46.040 --> 15:52.560]  Well, I genuinely was excited about the Twilight baseball thing after it,
[15:52.600 --> 15:54.120]  but it went for $4,000.
[15:54.500 --> 15:55.400]  So it went way over.
[15:55.780 --> 15:56.540]  It was huge.
[15:56.660 --> 15:59.100]  Like people, it's an iconic scene from that movie.
[16:00.560 --> 16:03.220]  Yeah, I also had the thought of like, okay, now I have it.
[16:03.280 --> 16:05.120]  I'm the only one here that knows that.
[16:05.640 --> 16:09.180]  How much do I want to fuck with you two about the fact we missed it or not?
[16:09.540 --> 16:10.300]  A tremendous amount, I would imagine.
[16:10.300 --> 16:10.940]  What could I do?
[16:11.140 --> 16:13.020]  A little bit, but I didn't want it to be like,
[16:13.020 --> 16:16.020]  so exhausting that you weren't even excited that we got it.
[16:16.120 --> 16:20.520]  Like I felt like there's a fine line of like reverse salad creaming
[16:20.520 --> 16:23.040]  of where I did the right thing, but I still fucked it up.
[16:23.280 --> 16:24.420]  Dude, I didn't think you had it at all.
[16:24.600 --> 16:26.880]  Because Geoff and I had to trick the universe yesterday
[16:26.880 --> 16:28.840]  into hanging out at the last second,
[16:28.960 --> 16:31.040]  and we were both pretty convinced that we didn't have it.
[16:31.240 --> 16:33.340]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.
[16:33.720 --> 16:34.620]  Oh man, but we did.
[16:34.700 --> 16:37.420]  We did knock off a bucket list thing yesterday and we filmed it.
[16:38.200 --> 16:38.620]  Did you? Oh yeah.
[16:38.900 --> 16:40.280]  Should I post it in the Discord?
[16:41.300 --> 16:43.300]  Uh, yeah, yeah, might as well.
[16:43.680 --> 16:47.860]  Um, but let me just say, uh, all kidding aside, Andrew,
[16:48.320 --> 16:50.120]  um, I know a second ago I did that.
[16:50.240 --> 16:51.480]  I did the funny thing where I was like,
[16:51.500 --> 16:52.640]  I talked about how I always believed in you
[16:52.640 --> 16:53.760]  and I never doubted you for a second.
[16:54.160 --> 16:57.340]  Uh, all kidding aside, I didn't for one second
[16:57.340 --> 16:58.480]  think you would pull this off.
[16:58.760 --> 17:01.220]  I was convinced you would screw it up and you didn't.
[17:01.340 --> 17:03.880]  And I want you to know you have got the biggest
[17:03.880 --> 17:06.880]  get at a salad creaming free card from me.
[17:07.300 --> 17:09.440]  Uh, you can cash in whenever you want.
[17:10.280 --> 17:11.440]  The, uh, final total.
[17:13.620 --> 17:14.260]  You've got it.
[17:14.300 --> 17:16.420]  You've got to like get out of Greg free card
[17:16.420 --> 17:18.920]  where like next time, whatever it is, I don't care.
[17:19.000 --> 17:20.640]  I'll just, I will turn the other cheek.
[17:21.300 --> 17:24.040]  Between the fees and the shipping and everything,
[17:24.040 --> 17:27.460]  it costs like $2,700 for the tuxedo.
[17:27.520 --> 17:28.060]  That is a bargain.
[17:28.060 --> 17:28.880]  So we even went under the cap.
[17:29.040 --> 17:29.640]  So we're great.
[17:30.080 --> 17:30.920]  That is a bargain.
[17:31.480 --> 17:33.100]  But I'd love to see what bucket list.
[17:33.220 --> 17:35.300]  I'm assuming it's the pizza would be my guess.
[17:35.500 --> 17:36.340]  No, no.
[17:36.440 --> 17:39.720]  Okay, well, first off, let me just say this.
[17:40.800 --> 17:43.220]  Uh, I mentioned kind of hilariously
[17:43.220 --> 17:46.080]  that Gavin and I tried to go to Vegas together for a vacation.
[17:46.700 --> 17:51.420]  And I was going to go to the NBA finals and, uh, Emily got COVID.
[17:51.640 --> 17:54.820]  And so the like two days before the trip, we had to cancel, right?
[17:55.280 --> 17:57.200]  Well, in the back of our heads, it was okay.
[17:58.200 --> 18:04.420]  Because two weeks later, I had this trip to VidCon in Anaheim that I had to go do a panel at,
[18:04.560 --> 18:07.180]  which if you don't know what VidCon is, you're lucky.
[18:07.440 --> 18:08.000]  Don't look it up.
[18:08.020 --> 18:08.640]  You don't need to know.
[18:08.640 --> 18:09.820]  Not a fun time.
[18:10.620 --> 18:15.180]  Uh, I, although I did get to experience Eric Bador experience, uh, VidCon for the first time.
[18:15.260 --> 18:16.180]  I wish he was here to talk about it.
[18:16.200 --> 18:20.300]  He was, it was, it was really funny watching his unfiltered opinions of everything that was going on.
[18:20.500 --> 18:26.920]  Uh, anyway, so, uh, because of that, I, uh, I said, Hey, Emily, let's go back.
[18:27.000 --> 18:28.860]  We, you know, we went to before the pandemic started.
[18:28.900 --> 18:32.440]  We went to Disneyland with Vanessa, uh, who's one of the early bat.
[18:32.540 --> 18:37.380]  She's one of the people that got the bat, the original bats, uh, Emily's best friend and her husband.
[18:37.380 --> 18:40.900]  And so we planned to use my work trip to go to, to Disneyland.
[18:41.220 --> 18:42.860]  And so went down there.
[18:43.280 --> 18:44.800]  Uh, they were going to meet me the next day.
[18:45.100 --> 18:47.000]  Uh, Emily got in, flew down.
[18:47.180 --> 18:51.100]  I did my panel for VidCon, got out of my panel, met Eric.
[18:51.220 --> 18:53.060]  We did a podcast, a different podcast.
[18:53.200 --> 18:55.160]  Just the two of us for a non f*** face podcast.
[18:55.340 --> 18:57.840]  We did the animal one, got out of that podcast.
[18:58.180 --> 19:01.060]  Emily called me and was like, uh, Henry collapsed.
[19:01.240 --> 19:02.240]  He had a heart problem.
[19:02.380 --> 19:03.580]  We have to go back home.
[19:03.700 --> 19:06.640]  And we immediately got on a plane and went back to Austin.
[19:07.140 --> 19:08.160]  Henry's fine, by the way.
[19:08.360 --> 19:09.360]  He, he, uh, he's okay.
[19:09.820 --> 19:14.240]  Uh, but, uh, so we had to leave in the middle of the trip and I'd never stepped foot in
[19:14.240 --> 19:16.640]  Disneyland and we had to come home, but we made lemonade.
[19:17.020 --> 19:18.920]  Coke, Gavin and I went jet skiing on Sunday.
[19:19.440 --> 19:20.940]  I see you've posted a video.
[19:21.200 --> 19:21.420]  Oh yeah.
[19:21.480 --> 19:21.640]  Yeah.
[19:21.660 --> 19:23.220]  I meant to say, Gavin, I went jet skiing.
[19:23.400 --> 19:26.200]  And then at that point in my head, the video would play for everybody.
[19:26.260 --> 19:26.580]  Okay.
[19:26.660 --> 19:27.520]  You probably have to hit play.
[19:27.560 --> 19:29.100]  Oh yeah, play on this.
[19:29.160 --> 19:29.420]  Okay.
[19:29.500 --> 19:31.660]  I'm anticipating this being a certain thing.
[19:31.680 --> 19:32.400]  I'm going to watch this.
[19:32.760 --> 19:33.680]  It's eight seconds.
[19:33.680 --> 19:34.800]  Don't wait for it.
[19:40.180 --> 19:44.260]  I feel like that was the least thrilling version of what just happened, but that is definitely,
[19:44.720 --> 19:46.460]  that's definitely a bucket list item.
[19:46.860 --> 19:48.840]  That is a high C's high five, buddy.
[19:49.340 --> 19:52.160]  Gavin and I did a high five on jet skis.
[19:52.460 --> 19:55.720]  And that cheer that, that like shout for me after it happens.
[19:55.760 --> 19:57.020]  That isn't me cheering.
[19:57.240 --> 20:00.400]  That's me screaming in agony because it hurts so much.
[20:00.740 --> 20:05.120]  Even at like five miles an hour, which I think is the slowest I can go on that thing.
[20:06.500 --> 20:07.380]  So much.
[20:07.380 --> 20:09.920]  My hand hurt for like four hours after we went.
[20:10.940 --> 20:13.980]  I kept looking over and he was like, he shook it for the rest of the day.
[20:16.200 --> 20:17.920]  So we're working our way up though.
[20:18.120 --> 20:20.840]  That's a five mile an hour high five on jet skis.
[20:21.960 --> 20:24.280]  Yes, we, that's the final attempt.
[20:24.360 --> 20:24.980]  We did it three times.
[20:25.020 --> 20:26.960]  The first time we did definitely hit each other.
[20:27.480 --> 20:33.440]  The one before that, we high fived and I immediately crashed into Geoff's jet ski,
[20:33.620 --> 20:37.060]  which caused Emily to like rock back and accidentally stop recording.
[20:37.520 --> 20:38.380]  Oh, no.
[20:39.020 --> 20:41.040]  So the next time we don't have a video of that.
[20:41.160 --> 20:42.600]  Oh, but this week we did.
[20:43.040 --> 20:45.160]  Oh, I feel like that's the better video.
[20:45.280 --> 20:47.520]  Honestly, this was a much better high five.
[20:47.560 --> 20:48.380]  The one that Gavin should.
[20:48.760 --> 20:51.240]  Yeah, but I feel like the footage is better for the other one.
[20:51.320 --> 20:54.360]  This is just like a, it's good, but it's not.
[20:54.420 --> 20:54.760]  I don't know.
[20:55.320 --> 20:58.180]  So the next, next step is we got to hit ramps.
[20:58.200 --> 20:58.920]  We're going to do it in the air.
[20:59.780 --> 21:01.020]  That's a huge step.
[21:01.820 --> 21:02.580]  What do you mean?
[21:02.620 --> 21:03.580]  That's the next step.
[21:03.720 --> 21:06.380]  I feel like there's so many steps between those two things.
[21:06.380 --> 21:11.340]  What about aiming for like seven miles per hour instead of adding air?
[21:12.220 --> 21:13.840]  Oh, is this another one?
[21:13.900 --> 21:14.980]  Is this the crash one?
[21:16.080 --> 21:17.060]  This is where I yell at Emily.
[21:21.140 --> 21:22.580]  So you're riding up.
[21:23.340 --> 21:24.160]  Oh, that's a good one again.
[21:25.660 --> 21:26.690]  There's a little bit of...
[21:27.300 --> 21:29.560]  No, that was the bump.
[21:29.760 --> 21:32.700]  And then Emily always fell off and stopped recording back there.
[21:33.220 --> 21:35.260]  And what you can't see really, that one is the,
[21:35.620 --> 21:36.940]  I'm like stuck sideways at the beginning,
[21:36.940 --> 21:38.680]  because for some reason the jet ski turned off.
[21:38.900 --> 21:40.060]  So for the run up of that,
[21:40.140 --> 21:42.180]  I'm trying to figure out how to turn on my jet ski again.
[21:43.880 --> 21:44.860]  That was fun.
[21:45.400 --> 21:46.900]  Yeah, I mean, it looks great.
[21:47.060 --> 21:48.440]  I think it's a great starting point.
[21:48.680 --> 21:50.840]  We definitely now know that this is possible.
[21:51.280 --> 21:52.280]  Oh, super possible.
[21:52.640 --> 21:53.360]  Super possible.
[21:53.560 --> 21:54.240]  Working out the specifics.
[21:54.240 --> 21:55.260]  Good proof of concept.
[21:55.720 --> 21:56.240]  It's fantastic.
[21:56.440 --> 21:57.680]  Yeah, it's a great way to put it.
[21:57.880 --> 22:01.520]  The most badass bike stunt starts with the smallest of bunny hops.
[22:01.640 --> 22:02.880]  It takes a little bit of time.
[22:03.080 --> 22:03.760]  Yeah, work your way up.
[22:03.760 --> 22:04.380]  We're going to get there.
[22:04.480 --> 22:04.960]  We're going to get there.
[22:06.060 --> 22:06.640]  I can't wait.
[22:06.940 --> 22:08.460]  And Gavin and I made a lot of lemonade
[22:08.460 --> 22:11.480]  out of the fact that I have had two vacations in a row cancelled.
[22:11.720 --> 22:15.380]  And this one, literally, Emily, we flew to L.A.
[22:16.720 --> 22:19.820]  Emily flew to L.A., had lunch, and then got back on a plane and went home.
[22:21.980 --> 22:22.860]  So annoying.
[22:22.860 --> 22:24.000]  Slept in the same bed the whole time.
[22:24.240 --> 22:25.060]  Oh, that's terrible.
[22:25.620 --> 22:26.400]  Oh my god.
[22:27.520 --> 22:31.580]  Speaking of another adorable thing Henry did, let me show you a photo.
[22:33.340 --> 22:34.600]  I'll... oh man.
[22:35.520 --> 22:37.320]  Is it the least favorite thing for you guys?
[22:38.080 --> 22:40.260]  When I have to try to do stuff?
[22:40.560 --> 22:41.640]  Really? Well, it depends.
[22:41.720 --> 22:43.660]  Sometimes it can be so bad, it's great.
[22:44.280 --> 22:46.360]  If it's just in the middle, it's not as fun.
[22:47.420 --> 22:51.560]  This is on the day before we left for Los Angeles.
[22:52.160 --> 22:55.540]  I was working on my laptop and I set it down on this little bench,
[22:55.580 --> 22:56.980]  a little leather bench by my bed.
[22:57.540 --> 23:00.160]  And when I came back five minutes later...
[23:00.160 --> 23:04.240]  See, Henry is an elder gentleman now.
[23:04.240 --> 23:11.360]  So we dress him at all times in a bow tie and a diaper, because he has accidents.
[23:11.940 --> 23:20.280]  I forgot to put the diaper on him and he peed 37 gallons directly onto my laptop.
[23:22.420 --> 23:27.100]  When I came back to pick up my laptop, it's just urine fell out of all the ports.
[23:28.200 --> 23:29.480]  That's so much piss.
[23:30.160 --> 23:31.240]  That's a colossal amount of piss.
[23:31.240 --> 23:35.060]  And ironically, the picture's the wrong way as well.
[23:35.140 --> 23:36.780]  Yeah, well, it's me.
[23:37.000 --> 23:38.940]  I was thinking about the classic Geoff photo.
[23:40.300 --> 23:43.520]  So I had to buy a new laptop that day.
[23:43.940 --> 23:44.340]  That guy.
[23:44.660 --> 23:44.820]  No!
[23:45.040 --> 23:46.020]  Yeah, just dead.
[23:46.060 --> 23:46.600]  Oh, no.
[23:46.980 --> 23:47.460]  Straight up dead.
[23:47.900 --> 23:48.760]  He didn't mean it.
[23:49.260 --> 23:50.720]  No, I can't.
[23:50.800 --> 23:51.440]  That's so much...
[23:51.440 --> 23:55.560]  It looks like a Rorschach of piss, like the way that it bends.
[23:56.960 --> 23:59.800]  Out of all the places from the pee, I've got it on my laptop.
[24:00.280 --> 24:02.840]  Hey, I got a piss boiled.
[24:03.580 --> 24:06.160]  I got a brand new MacBook Air.
[24:06.300 --> 24:07.720]  So, I mean, it's the M1 chipset.
[24:07.860 --> 24:08.880]  Hey, congratulations.
[24:10.940 --> 24:13.080]  It's obsolete as of July.
[24:14.480 --> 24:16.180]  I needed a laptop for work.
[24:16.300 --> 24:16.940]  So what am I going to do?
[24:16.940 --> 24:19.660]  Could you just wait a month to not have a laptop?
[24:20.260 --> 24:20.700]  No.
[24:24.800 --> 24:27.660]  Another funny thing while we're talking about shit that's costing me money.
[24:27.660 --> 24:32.900]  Uh, did I tell you guys that I wrecked my car recently?
[24:33.160 --> 24:35.160]  No, you wrecked my car?
[24:35.660 --> 24:36.320]  I wrecked your car.
[24:36.380 --> 24:36.860]  Not bad.
[24:37.340 --> 24:37.820]  Not bad.
[24:38.120 --> 24:39.520]  So I have a one...
[24:39.520 --> 24:42.780]  I have two cars and a one car garage or one car driveway.
[24:42.980 --> 24:49.600]  And so when I had my yard work done, I had them like eke out as much of a second area as possible.
[24:49.700 --> 24:52.620]  So now I have like a one and three quarter driveway.
[24:52.620 --> 24:57.760]  So to get my car in the driveway requires some like Austin Powers-ing around shit.
[24:58.000 --> 24:58.860]  But I'm used to it.
[24:58.900 --> 24:59.360]  I'm good at it.
[24:59.440 --> 25:00.900]  I enjoy the challenge.
[25:01.020 --> 25:02.800]  But the other day I was in a hurry about a month ago.
[25:02.860 --> 25:03.440]  I was in a hurry.
[25:03.800 --> 25:07.360]  And I just I was just like taking Millie somewhere and I was stressed out and I wasn't paying
[25:07.360 --> 25:07.660]  attention.
[25:08.140 --> 25:11.540]  And I clipped this pole pulling out of my driveway.
[25:11.740 --> 25:17.640]  And so I just scraped a bunch of paint off the driver's side of my passenger or my rear door.
[25:18.700 --> 25:21.360]  And so I took it to a collision place or I took it to BMW.
[25:21.360 --> 25:23.160]  And then they told me the place to get it repaired.
[25:23.460 --> 25:25.300]  And so I took it to these guys.
[25:25.520 --> 25:29.060]  I had to get on a waiting list for three weeks because they're so busy.
[25:29.840 --> 25:33.880]  Finally, last Wednesday, I dropped it off because I was going out of town.
[25:33.940 --> 25:36.580]  I was going to be at, you know, VidCon and Disneyland and whatnot.
[25:38.000 --> 25:38.980]  I dropped it off.
[25:39.400 --> 25:43.200]  And then I started immediately getting like really verbose texts from them.
[25:43.240 --> 25:46.300]  Like, hey, I just want to let you know we removed the quarter panel and we started spraying
[25:46.300 --> 25:46.980]  the quarter panel.
[25:47.180 --> 25:49.060]  And when that's done, then we're going to do this and that.
[25:49.140 --> 25:50.660]  And just like a ton of information.
[25:50.660 --> 25:51.300]  It's like really cool.
[25:51.860 --> 25:57.620]  Then at Friday, while Emily and I were running around trying to get back to Austin, I missed
[25:57.620 --> 25:58.400]  a couple of phone calls.
[25:58.460 --> 25:59.080]  And I thought, that's weird.
[25:59.440 --> 26:03.180]  And I was ignoring it because I was trying to drive from Anaheim back to LAX and book
[26:03.180 --> 26:03.920]  a flight and stuff.
[26:06.040 --> 26:10.440]  And I got a text after that that was like, hey, it's so-and-so from the collision place.
[26:11.260 --> 26:14.740]  Hey, give me a call on Monday about your car when you get a chance.
[26:15.060 --> 26:17.040]  And I looked at Emily and I thought, that's bad.
[26:17.400 --> 26:18.020]  And she's like, what do you mean?
[26:18.040 --> 26:19.100]  He just wants you to talk on Monday.
[26:19.100 --> 26:24.620]  Yeah, but every other text I've gotten from these guys has been really informed, like
[26:24.620 --> 26:25.720]  overly so.
[26:26.920 --> 26:31.500]  And this is just sort of a, hey, just give me a call when you get a chance.
[26:31.780 --> 26:32.460]  Very vague.
[26:32.580 --> 26:35.480]  And I thought, they've done something to my car.
[26:35.860 --> 26:36.900]  And she's like, you're being paranoid.
[26:37.300 --> 26:40.020]  So this morning when I woke up, the first thing I did was call them.
[26:41.200 --> 26:44.220]  And he was like, yeah, gee, really sorry about this.
[26:44.540 --> 26:45.580]  We had your car already.
[26:45.700 --> 26:47.640]  It was all painted and we got it all set up.
[26:47.640 --> 26:51.260]  And then we were going to drive it over to BMW for a certification.
[26:51.560 --> 26:54.400]  We got to certify these cameras or whatever and get them calibrated there.
[26:55.040 --> 26:56.520]  And well, we were pulling out.
[26:56.680 --> 27:00.320]  And well, we hit we got into a car accident with your car.
[27:01.020 --> 27:04.340]  And no, no, they wrecked my car.
[27:06.140 --> 27:08.100]  After they fixed it, they wrecked it.
[27:08.200 --> 27:13.880]  So they're like, you know, obviously we're going to repair it and we'll get it certified
[27:13.880 --> 27:15.980]  by BMW and it won't cost you a dime.
[27:15.980 --> 27:20.040]  And we're really sorry, but we're going to need it another week because we wrecked your car.
[27:20.520 --> 27:21.420]  What did they do?
[27:21.520 --> 27:22.280]  Did they hit another car?
[27:22.520 --> 27:23.000]  Or did they just...
[27:23.000 --> 27:24.160]  They got something.
[27:24.300 --> 27:27.720]  Somebody in a truck ran into it.
[27:28.180 --> 27:29.260]  Oh my god.
[27:37.320 --> 27:38.040]  While they...
[27:38.860 --> 27:40.440]  So when do you get your car back?
[27:40.460 --> 27:41.160]  Next week?
[27:41.600 --> 27:42.080]  At this point?
[27:42.100 --> 27:43.280]  I was supposed to get it today.
[27:43.920 --> 27:45.860]  No, I think hopefully I get it Friday.
[27:46.480 --> 27:50.300]  Oh, Emily was like, man, you were way cooler about that than I would have been.
[27:50.380 --> 27:51.760]  And I was just like, what are you going to do?
[27:51.820 --> 27:54.280]  I mean, like, well, I mean, as long as it's their insurance, right?
[27:54.440 --> 27:55.640]  It's just they're fixing it.
[27:55.700 --> 27:58.060]  But it's like at this point, like, sure.
[27:58.140 --> 27:59.460]  Why not throw it on the pile?
[27:59.980 --> 28:02.720]  Fucking who cares?
[28:04.420 --> 28:10.160]  We already ate two entire vacations to Vegas and Disneyland in the last two weeks.
[28:10.200 --> 28:10.680]  Why not?
[28:10.840 --> 28:12.560]  I just bought a new laptop for no reason.
[28:12.560 --> 28:17.640]  I'm trying to look in the roll sack of piss to see if there's a car crash that I can spot.
[28:21.740 --> 28:24.940]  So when did the laptop happen in relation to the car?
[28:25.180 --> 28:26.060]  Was this after?
[28:26.900 --> 28:28.200]  Yeah, the laptop.
[28:28.380 --> 28:30.620]  I dropped the car off Wednesday morning.
[28:31.220 --> 28:33.560]  Henry peed on the laptop Wednesday afternoon.
[28:34.380 --> 28:37.080]  OK, so you didn't know that your car was going to get destroyed?
[28:37.080 --> 28:40.260]  I didn't find out my car was destroyed until well today.
[28:40.640 --> 28:43.080]  But I had an I had an inkling on Friday evening.
[28:43.500 --> 28:44.520]  Yeah, something was wrong.
[28:44.860 --> 28:46.300]  Or maybe Tuesday I dropped my car.
[28:46.380 --> 28:47.740]  Anyway, yeah, it had been there for a couple of days.
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.720]  So apart from, of course, things are things are going about like,
[28:54.720 --> 28:57.080]  like pretty, pretty normal in Geoff's world.
[28:57.240 --> 28:58.320]  Just to give you guys an update.
[28:58.800 --> 29:01.640]  Well, I almost said it in bed in bed this morning.
[29:01.700 --> 29:06.580]  I told Emily, I said, on the bright side, at least nothing's happened to the and she goes, shut up.
[29:07.080 --> 29:09.100]  So I didn't I didn't actually say it out loud.
[29:09.100 --> 29:12.820]  It's an annoying step to verify the cameras.
[29:13.000 --> 29:16.800]  Is it like if they swap parts, they don't don't work until BMW sign off on it?
[29:17.280 --> 29:19.360]  I don't know. I think I think because it's like,
[29:19.440 --> 29:24.060]  because it's a BMW like certifies their cars and the repairs and stuff.
[29:24.140 --> 29:27.280]  So they only work with certain body shops.
[29:27.280 --> 29:30.560]  And then there's a yeah, I guess they have to like do it off on it.
[29:36.160 --> 29:40.340]  I'm on my phone quite a bit, whether it's using social media apps
[29:40.340 --> 29:44.160]  or maybe getting food delivered and all sorts of reasons why I use it.
[29:44.440 --> 29:49.140]  But the scary part is, is that your phone carrier collects data on whatever it is you're doing.
[29:49.560 --> 29:51.000]  Verizon is even admitted to it.
[29:51.320 --> 29:53.720]  They say it so that they can better understand your interests.
[29:53.780 --> 29:56.400]  But really, all they want is to sell your activity to advertisers.
[29:56.880 --> 29:59.500]  Stuff like the sites you visited and what you've been up to online.
[29:59.960 --> 30:04.460]  The more they can get on you, the larger their paycheck becomes, which is why I use ExpressVPN.
[30:05.200 --> 30:08.580]  ExpressVPN is an app that prevents your phone carrier from being able to see the
[30:08.580 --> 30:10.980]  that you visit and sell it off to third parties.
[30:11.520 --> 30:15.480]  All it takes is one tap of a button and all of your network data gets encrypted
[30:15.480 --> 30:19.860]  and rerouted through ExpressVPN secure servers for ultimate privacy.
[30:20.300 --> 30:25.140]  Not only does it shield your web browsing, ExpressVPN protects all of your network data
[30:25.140 --> 30:28.280]  so you can stay private even when using your favorite apps.
[30:28.760 --> 30:33.900]  Whether you're an iPhone, Android, or even a tablet user, ExpressVPN works on all your devices.
[30:33.900 --> 30:39.080]  The best part is one subscription can be used on up to five devices at the same time.
[30:39.480 --> 30:41.800]  I have my whole family using ExpressVPN too.
[30:42.240 --> 30:45.700]  When your phone carrier tracks you, that's a gross invasion of privacy.
[30:46.080 --> 30:50.640]  You can either keep letting them cash in on you or visit expressvpn.com
[30:50.640 --> 30:53.660]  slash face to get the same VPN I use.
[30:54.180 --> 30:59.300]  Take back your online privacy today and use my link to get three extra months free.

[31:09.820 --> 31:14.500]  You know what sucks is when you're on like a walk or working out in some capacity and your earbuds
[31:14.500 --> 31:19.140]  won't fit. Like I have it where I'll be enjoying a podcast or listening to music and I've got
[31:19.140 --> 31:23.740]  standard ears. It's not an ear issue and they just won't fit like they keep popping out or
[31:23.740 --> 31:28.060]  you feel like you have to adjust them. But that's why Raycon's new fitness earbuds provide a maximum
[31:28.060 --> 31:32.940]  secure fit so you'll never experience that again. Raycon's fitness earbuds help you take

[31:44.660 --> 31:47.800]  They were developed and tested to stay in your ear during the toughest of workouts.

[31:52.880 --> 31:58.380]  The unique earbud build, interchangeable gel tips, and Raycon's new ear stabilizer attachments

[34:01.000 --> 34:05.140]  turn your day around a little bit, Geoff, with telling you about some victories you've had
[34:05.140 --> 34:11.240]  against me without even knowing it. I'm also, I'm losing money too. Try to fight you in ways
[34:11.240 --> 34:20.420]  you don't even know. I'm down $80 at this point. So this goes all the way back to when you mailed
[34:20.420 --> 34:25.120]  me the giant thing, a bubble wrap. That was, that was part one of this. You were so kind,
[34:25.500 --> 34:30.960]  being thoughtful, taking care of me, wanting to make sure I'm okay. You sent me a giant thing,
[34:31.140 --> 34:37.560]  a bubble wrap from Amazon. So I decided that I need to return the favor because no, you know,
[34:37.560 --> 34:41.400]  I love giving gifts to people. It's so, it's such a great feeling, you know, show somebody
[34:41.400 --> 34:47.300]  that you care about, you love them, get them something nice. So you got me the bubble wrap.
[34:47.400 --> 34:52.020]  I was laying in bed. I couldn't sleep. And I thought, what would be a great gift for Geoff?
[34:52.460 --> 34:57.320]  And then I just thought, what if, what is the most amount of bananas I could send Geoff at one
[34:57.320 --> 35:03.360]  time? Cause you're a big banana guy. You love bananas. So I hopped on. I would say I like
[35:03.360 --> 35:11.340]  bananas about as much as Emily likes swans. Like an average amount. I'm a B minus banana fan.
[35:12.900 --> 35:19.040]  So I, I went on and I made an account. I use the free trial for Amazon prime on amazon.com
[35:19.040 --> 35:23.600]  and they have a fresh section where it's like a grocery delivery service they have. Yes,
[35:23.600 --> 35:28.040]  I'm familiar. And I, I was, it was like 1am and I was like, you know what? These are pretty cheap.
[35:28.140 --> 35:32.700]  They're two pounds a bag. I'm going to send Geoff a thousand pounds of bananas tomorrow.
[35:32.700 --> 35:39.880]  I'm just going to do this. So I did it. I had sent, and then I went to go back to sleep again.
[35:39.960 --> 35:47.120]  And I did this from my tablet. I sent Geoff a thousand pounds of bananas. A ton of bananas?
[35:47.700 --> 35:56.180]  I sent 500 two pound bags and I hit clear. And then because I'm unfortunately not a bad enough
[35:56.180 --> 36:01.280]  person, I thought about it and I was like, you know what? I don't, I don't know what Geoff,
[36:01.280 --> 36:05.900]  maybe something's happening to Geoff's life. I don't know his schedule. I didn't want it to be
[36:05.900 --> 36:09.960]  like Todd Margaret where all the food and all the animals take over the house. Like,
[36:10.440 --> 36:14.420]  like a bunch of animals would eat a thousand pounds and scatter it everywhere and just move
[36:14.420 --> 36:19.380]  into your home. I felt really bad about it. So I canceled the order five minutes later.
[36:19.500 --> 36:26.320]  And I went back to bed and I just went about my day. And that evening happened to be a very
[36:27.340 --> 36:30.780]  important family dinner that I was paying for, that I was going to cover.
[36:31.280 --> 36:35.160]  It was like this built up dinner. It was very exciting. I was so happy about it.
[36:35.320 --> 36:40.660]  And I get to the place and I give them my card and they say, uh, it doesn't, it's not going through.
[36:40.800 --> 36:45.860]  And I thought, oh, that's weird. So then I gave them my other card and they told me, yeah,
[36:45.860 --> 36:50.280]  this one isn't going through either. And that's, that's all the money I have. So I'm like, what is,
[36:50.760 --> 36:55.280]  I don't, give me a minute. I'm going to try to, I got to figure this out. So I left and I had to
[36:55.280 --> 37:00.660]  thankfully I had cash. I never have cash. I just happen to have cash. I was able to pay for it,
[37:00.980 --> 37:05.320]  but I couldn't figure out what was wrong. And so I was looking at my phone and they,
[37:05.380 --> 37:10.160]  they deactivated my account because I bought so many bananas. They thought it was a fraudulent
[37:10.160 --> 37:16.260]  charge. I got a text at like 2am that he just hadn't, I didn't notice. And my account had been
[37:16.260 --> 37:21.280]  locked the entire time. So then I was on hold for like two hours that evening trying to get them to
[37:21.280 --> 37:26.820]  unlock my account. Didn't work. So I've lost, I've lost time at this point for Geoff and this,
[37:27.000 --> 37:30.640]  this issue. And that fell apart. It was a disaster. So I was able to get the dinner.
[37:30.740 --> 37:34.200]  Everything was okay, but I almost couldn't buy this really important built up dinner
[37:34.200 --> 37:41.660]  because I bought 500 bags of bananas. So that was having to explain to people,
[37:41.720 --> 37:46.000]  like there was a moment where I thought I might not be able to get this and having to explain why
[37:46.000 --> 37:52.240]  it was ridiculous. So then that happened. Some time passes. We're nearing episode 100. And I thought,
[37:52.340 --> 37:57.080]  you know what? This could be a great time. The way that we had to record that episode,
[37:57.200 --> 38:04.220]  we'd have a two hour window. I am going to send Geoff like 600. I was reduced. I realized,
[38:04.280 --> 38:09.000]  so how Amazon fresh works is let's say you want to buy a thousand bananas. You put in a thousand
[38:09.000 --> 38:13.740]  and they'll say, ah, I can't do it, but we do have 700. So I just always put in a high number and
[38:13.740 --> 38:18.860]  the maxes. So for episode 100, I thought I'm going to do this again. So I signed up for Amazon
[38:18.860 --> 38:23.040]  prime again and I was getting ready to do it. But then I had a thought of like, well, I don't know,
[38:23.100 --> 38:28.480]  you know what's going on with Geoff. And then Geoff, you had, uh, you almost quit this podcast because
[38:28.480 --> 38:36.480]  of the dinger video of you missing. So then I was like, I cannot send this man 800 pounds of bananas.
[38:36.800 --> 38:42.480]  This is not a good time. I'm going to just hold off on this. So I held off and I hadn't thought
[38:42.480 --> 38:48.660]  about it until last week. I'm looking at my credit card statement and I noticed a $20 charge
[38:48.660 --> 38:52.460]  from Amazon and I don't know what it is. And I look at all my accounts. I can't figure out.
[38:52.780 --> 38:58.420]  I didn't order anything. I realized I forgot to cancel the trial from episode 100. So I've been
[38:58.420 --> 39:04.300]  being billed $20 a month for the past three months because I just forgot to turn it off.
[39:04.600 --> 39:10.160]  So that's, I'm now down $80 in like three hours of time. And I've almost ruined a family dinner.
[39:10.680 --> 39:16.420]  Then last week, I don't want to get into like the specific, I had one of the worst weeks I've had
[39:16.420 --> 39:22.040]  in a long time. Oh no. Just terrible. So sorry, buddy. And I missed, I missed a break shit because
[39:22.040 --> 39:27.400]  of it that I was going to be on. I was excited about it. And I, so I watched it. I watched on
[39:27.400 --> 39:34.320]  like Saturday night and I'm having the worst week. I'm just a miserable, not good. And you took a
[39:34.320 --> 39:39.780]  shot at me and it hurt my feelings because of the week as a whole. Yeah. I was, I was angry.
[39:39.780 --> 39:44.640]  I, that's how I felt with the dinger video. I was just at a, I was at a weak point and you
[39:44.640 --> 39:48.180]  took a shot at me when I wasn't prepared. What shot did I take? I'm very sorry.
[39:48.700 --> 39:53.160]  Eric played the soundboard. And then you said that's as much as Andrew contributes normally.
[39:53.480 --> 39:58.760]  And I was like, I fucking hate you. Cause it's tough. And I try really hard on that show. And
[39:58.760 --> 40:01.940]  that's like one of my anxiety points is because you guys have so much more spirit.
[40:02.180 --> 40:07.420]  Something you are frequently nervous about just because it's, it's live and it's hard to get
[40:07.420 --> 40:12.740]  So I was mad at you. And I thought this motherfucker and I've just had a bad week.
[40:13.120 --> 40:16.780]  So I thought, Oh, you know what? This guy loves, he fucking loves swimming pools. He loves swimming.
[40:16.780 --> 40:21.080]  What can I do? What can I do to the kindness of my heart? I noticed last time I was on there,
[40:21.480 --> 40:26.540]  they sold gallons of water for 89 cents each. And I was like, Oh, you know what? I want to be really
[40:26.540 --> 40:30.880]  nice to Geoff. I'll buy him some water for his pool. So when his pool gets there, he'll have the
[40:30.880 --> 40:36.620]  water to put it in. Let's buy some water for Geoff. And so I went to load up as much as they could.
[40:36.620 --> 40:42.780]  And since 100 in that time, they have changed their system. I can only send you a max. Everything had
[40:42.780 --> 40:48.220]  order amounts to it. I couldn't go for the max. I can only send you three gallons at a time.
[40:48.460 --> 40:54.180]  And I couldn't regularly schedule it. So I wanted to send you 10 gallons of water every day
[40:54.180 --> 41:00.220]  for the month of July, but they would only let me send three per week. So that was ruined.
[41:00.220 --> 41:03.880]  And I was like, well, that was, that was pointless. I can't even do anything with this. I'm down
[41:03.880 --> 41:10.400]  another 20 for another month of Amazon. I'm down $80 and three hours and you keep beating me and
[41:10.400 --> 41:15.980]  you have no idea that this is even happening. It has been an infuriating one-sided losing war.
[41:16.500 --> 41:23.740]  Oh man. Well, for the record, uh, congratulations. I think that you single-handedly are changing the
[41:23.740 --> 41:29.980]  way at Google Amazon or Google Amazon. You single-handedly are changing the way Amazon
[41:29.980 --> 41:34.260]  Freshworks. It sounds like they're having to put protections in place in the app because of you.
[41:34.980 --> 41:39.700]  Uh, and then I have no memory of saying that joke, but it's very funny and it sounds like
[41:39.700 --> 41:43.200]  something I would say. So I'll take your word for it. Yeah. I was not happy about it.
[41:43.720 --> 41:50.020]  Are you over it now? Are you still mad? No, I mean, I still don't love it, but it's,
[41:50.100 --> 41:53.880]  I'm not upset with you about it. I mean, I didn't mean it. It was just a joke.
[41:54.600 --> 41:59.520]  Do you, Andrew, do you think any of your bad week originated in, in your sock choice for the week?
[42:00.400 --> 42:06.920]  Oh, maybe I need to get into socks cause I don't, I'm not a socks guy. So maybe, have you had,
[42:07.140 --> 42:12.420]  what are the updated results of your, your sock work? Um, pretty okay. Just been still avoiding
[42:12.420 --> 42:17.440]  those red new ones. Yeah. You still haven't tried them? Still not, still not going to use them.
[42:17.840 --> 42:23.840]  I will say, Andrew, you sent me a lovely, uh, birthday card. It was a get well soon card,
[42:23.840 --> 42:30.860]  but it was reskinned as a, as a birthday card. It's a banana on roller skates with a cup of
[42:30.860 --> 42:38.260]  coffee in a boom box. And he says, he says, just wanted to say yellow. Hope you're peeling well.
[42:38.260 --> 42:42.540]  And I am peeling well. And I thank you for the happy birthday card. And it meant a lot to me.
[42:42.780 --> 42:48.680]  Andrew also sent me a link to a YouTube video in, he just wrote out the link to the YouTube video
[42:48.680 --> 42:54.740]  in the card. And, uh, Emily and I both spent about 45 minutes trying to different permutations
[42:54.740 --> 42:59.960]  to figure out how to get it to work. We eventually gave up, decided that it's just miss it. He just
[42:59.960 --> 43:05.220]  wrote it down wrong and, uh, mentioned it to him. And he says, I don't remember what it was.
[43:06.260 --> 43:11.700]  How unsatisfying. Yeah. Well, okay. So the thought process with that was, I just thought
[43:11.700 --> 43:17.200]  it was absurd to write a link in physical form and so much work for the person who's getting it.
[43:17.200 --> 43:24.080]  Yeah. And so I pulled up a YouTube video of a happy birthday song. And then I just changed one
[43:24.080 --> 43:28.120]  of the numbers and made sure it went nowhere. And then I just wrote that. So everything is
[43:28.120 --> 43:37.960]  right, but one number. And I was hoping that you would try multiple times. We tried. I gave up and
[43:37.960 --> 43:41.900]  Emily's like, I'll try. And then she tried for a while. And then eventually I was like, I bet
[43:41.900 --> 43:46.060]  I'm in the hole the whole time. I'm like, I don't know that this was ever supposed to work to begin
[43:46.060 --> 43:52.560]  with. This might have been the whole point of the card. I had a card and I thought I'll send this
[43:52.560 --> 43:57.540]  to Geoff. I don't know. Maybe I'll get into maybe letter writing become a thing I get into. Geoff
[43:57.540 --> 44:03.540]  had a little birthday party. It was quality. Oh yeah. Happy birthday to Geoff. Thanks, man. I did.
[44:03.620 --> 44:09.180]  I forgot that was, that was two weekends ago. Uh, we went swimming. We had a little, I rented a
[44:09.180 --> 44:12.640]  swim or Emily rented a swimming pool for us and we went swimming for the day. Did you post any videos
[44:12.640 --> 44:19.200]  of that? I don't think so. No. Did you? Uh, I don't know. Should we show Andrew the one of you
[44:19.200 --> 44:25.680]  on the diving board? Yeah. If you have it. Oh, there's lots of diving. It was a big ass diving
[44:25.680 --> 44:31.640]  board. Are you still feeling the effects of being bitten by a swan? Do you still feel like 20% more
[44:31.640 --> 44:37.020]  graceful than? No, I feel I know I'm back to normal. Also, uh, I tried desperately to show
[44:37.020 --> 44:41.660]  Gavin and Meg the swan, but he was not there yesterday. It's true. He did not make an
[44:41.660 --> 44:48.880]  appearance. Are you, are we waiting until? I think, I think we're waiting for, uh, he's looking
[44:48.880 --> 44:56.120]  for his phone. I did get this. I'm very excited. Oh, Hey, congratulations. Thank you. Oh, it's,
[44:56.120 --> 45:02.220]  it's a, it's going to be in the slack. Oh, okay. Yeah. File size too big. It's just too powerful.
[45:02.660 --> 45:07.980]  I'm excited. So is this you? Cause you dove through a ring last time, right? It was the last
[45:07.980 --> 45:11.920]  diving video we got of you. What type of dive are we looking at here? I don't even know.
[45:12.300 --> 45:16.360]  There was that much diving that you don't even, you can't recall. We just dove. I dove for like
[45:16.360 --> 45:20.220]  four hours straight. At one point I dove all my limbs through individual little hoops.
[45:20.980 --> 45:27.760]  Gavin had the dive of the day. The absolute dive of the day. We had this, well, watch this and then,
[45:27.880 --> 45:37.900]  yeah. Okay. I'm going to watch this. Oh, it's a slow motion Geoff dive. Doing a little wave,
[45:37.900 --> 45:44.640]  Laqueen's wave, transition. Amazing form. Looks like you missed the pool. Oh, there we go. There's
[45:44.640 --> 45:52.600]  the water. It's like an infinity pool with a diving pool on the other side. I see. It just
[45:52.600 --> 45:56.740]  looks like I fell off the world. It does. It looks like you just vanished. That should be a
[45:56.740 --> 46:01.140]  seven second clip. I'm not sure why it's a minute long, but that's, that's pretty much it. Just like
[46:01.140 --> 46:11.500]  untrimmed it. Ah, it was fun. I've never experienced a cheer so big in my life. Like
[46:11.500 --> 46:15.040]  we were just trying to do like funny dives after a while, like diving through the rubber ring.
[46:15.180 --> 46:20.280]  And then there were these little like tossed, like, was it ring toss hoops? Yeah. It was like
[46:20.280 --> 46:25.280]  blow up ring toss for like a floating flamingo. Yeah. And then suddenly there was just like four
[46:25.280 --> 46:30.180]  of them flowing in the diving area. So I just, I did a little springy dive, jump straight up the
[46:30.180 --> 46:35.640]  air that tried to thread both legs and both arms through the hoops. And I just came crashing down
[46:35.640 --> 46:39.940]  on them and I couldn't really tell what happened. And then I realized as I was slowly floating to
[46:39.940 --> 46:45.940]  the surface being pulled up by the hoops and I arose from the water with one on each limb and
[46:45.940 --> 46:52.520]  everyone was just like, ah, yeah, it was a really big accomplishment. He he's currently the,
[46:52.520 --> 47:01.560]  he currently is the world champion at at Limp Spear. I did. I did it. I was like,
[47:01.640 --> 47:06.040]  I we'd been trying it for a while. My best was to I got both legs in. Emily got three,
[47:06.260 --> 47:12.980]  two arms and a leg. And then Gavin showed up and just nailed it. And then he floated to the top,
[47:13.020 --> 47:18.300]  like in slow motion. It was it was really cool. I wish we'd have been filming that moment because
[47:18.300 --> 47:23.440]  it was definitely the dive of the year. Gavin has dive of the year hands up. In 80s and 90s
[47:23.440 --> 47:28.380]  movies where the movie ends on a freeze frame with the main guy smiling and everyone around
[47:28.380 --> 47:33.400]  him celebrating. It felt like that moment. It felt like the first freeze frame moment of my life.
[47:33.900 --> 47:41.980]  I would actually love to see a like strictly like looked at viewed dive of the year competition.
[47:42.300 --> 47:46.200]  I want there to be a dive of the year. Like I want to be able to see there's a leaderboard of
[47:46.200 --> 47:51.680]  dive of the year. A dive of the year every year would be fantastic. Maybe that's something we
[47:51.680 --> 47:56.020]  should get into. Declaring the official dive of the year. Are you a dive guy, Andrew?
[47:57.900 --> 48:03.160]  No, I wouldn't say I'm a dive guy. I enjoy falling. The falling part is fun, but not a dive.
[48:03.860 --> 48:07.720]  It's the coordination. The lack of coordination is really the issue with me with the dive. But
[48:07.720 --> 48:12.680]  the jumping off of a thing, always good. Yeah, that was my first experience with a bouncy
[48:12.680 --> 48:22.160]  diving board. It was very fun. Really? Yeah. As opposed to what? What do you mean? Like a
[48:22.160 --> 48:26.400]  rigid one, like, you know, if you're like at a high dive pool or something, it's just like a
[48:26.400 --> 48:32.020]  big solid one instead of a springy one. Yeah. And this is like this is so I consider myself
[48:32.020 --> 48:38.900]  pretty familiar with diving boards. I realize this is like the diving board you would find
[48:38.900 --> 48:46.020]  at a public pool in the 80s. That's like extra springy, like extra, extra springy. It's got like
[48:46.020 --> 48:51.240]  it's like twice the size of like you think of a diving board in a backyard pool and you go like
[48:51.240 --> 48:56.020]  boing boing and you go in. Right. This thing's got handrails. It's like three times as long
[48:56.020 --> 49:01.440]  as a regular diving board. Like this is a diving board we've been I think probably illegal in the
[49:01.440 --> 49:06.960]  city of Austin. But this is out in the fucking boonies, which is why we rent it. And we go out
[49:06.960 --> 49:10.580]  there and dive a lot. You can get I don't know, you can get a good 15 feet in the air off this
[49:10.580 --> 49:15.140]  diving board if you're jumping hard enough like it is fucking serious. Yeah. I rewatched the video.
[49:15.260 --> 49:19.120]  The spring is insane. I don't think I've ever seen a board with that much spring to it. And
[49:19.120 --> 49:23.440]  then the pool that it dives into is like 12 feet deep. So you can get really nice and fucking
[49:23.440 --> 49:29.240]  into it. It's good. I like that I have no concept of the pool that you actually dive into. I haven't
[49:29.240 --> 49:37.500]  seen a single actual dive from the angle that you have. We we it was funny because I was just diving
[49:37.500 --> 49:41.260]  pretty much throughout the day, but like everybody else had to work their way up to diving off that
[49:41.260 --> 49:44.780]  diving board. Trevor, all those guys were like, I'll give it a shot eventually. And then once
[49:44.780 --> 49:48.720]  everybody did and they realized how much fun it was, you couldn't keep them off. It's great. Hey,
[49:48.720 --> 49:56.160]  I had a dream about you last night, Gavin. Yeah, it's not good. So, yeah, go ahead. It was weird
[49:56.160 --> 50:01.680]  and I don't know what to think about it. But the dream started with me on your front porch
[50:02.220 --> 50:08.420]  pushing your doorbell. I'm pushing the doorbell and then I push the doorbell. And as soon as I
[50:08.420 --> 50:12.900]  push it, I think, why did I do that? And then I looked down and I'm like, why am I? Why am I
[50:12.900 --> 50:17.620]  in Gavin and Meg's front porch? Am I bringing something to them? And I look around like I must
[50:17.620 --> 50:20.740]  be delivering something to them. And I look around and I got nothing. And I'm like, did I forget it?
[50:20.760 --> 50:24.380]  What did I forget? What was I bringing? Am I even bringing something? Was I supposed to tell
[50:24.380 --> 50:29.420]  them something? What am I supposed to tell them? And then I thought, oh, no. What time of day is
[50:29.420 --> 50:33.640]  it? Is it even like an appropriate time to ring their doorbell? And I look at my watch and it's
[50:33.640 --> 50:38.200]  9 a.m. And I think, is 9 a.m. appropriate? Is it too early? It's a little early. And then I'm like,
[50:38.200 --> 50:45.420]  how did I get here? And right then I hear Gavin and Meg, like, because it's a dream, right? So I
[50:45.420 --> 50:50.660]  hear them in their bedroom, in bed, like clearly as if it's like filtering through the house. And
[50:50.660 --> 50:58.660]  I hear Gavin go, what? Oh, who rings a doorbell? And Meg's like, it's too early in the morning.
[50:58.860 --> 51:03.920]  And he's like, we're still in bed. And they're just like narrating all of my fears. He's like,
[51:04.040 --> 51:09.240]  I got, it better be important. And Meg's like, it's not going to be important. It's not going
[51:09.240 --> 51:13.800]  to be worth it. Don't go. And he's like, I've got to. They rang the bell. They wouldn't if
[51:13.800 --> 51:19.800]  they didn't need me. And I'm like, oh, fuck. And Gavin's like, I've got to put shoes on.
[51:19.800 --> 51:24.280]  And I can hear him putting shoes on in the bedroom. And I'm like, oh, fuck. I'm screwed.
[51:24.380 --> 51:28.500]  What do I do? He's going to be so mad at me. Meg's going to hate me. And I'm like looking
[51:28.500 --> 51:31.920]  where to hide. And I'm trying to hide behind a plant that's on your thing. I'm like, that's
[51:31.920 --> 51:35.420]  not going to work. And I run into your garage and I can't get your garage open. And then I'm like,
[51:35.440 --> 51:38.860]  oh, I'm tampering with their house. And then I run around the other side and there's like a fence.
[51:38.900 --> 51:42.100]  And I'm like, just trying to figure out where to hide so that you don't get mad at yelling at me.
[51:42.140 --> 51:47.560]  And then I realize, oh my God, he's got cameras. He'll just see me running around his house. I
[51:47.560 --> 51:52.280]  better just face the music. And I'm like, oh, so I just like, fuck it. And I walk up to the front
[51:52.280 --> 51:55.880]  door and I'm like, got my head down. And I just stand in front of your front door and I can just
[51:55.880 --> 51:59.960]  hear you coming through the house going, oh, I just can't fucking believe it. It's a Saturday.
[52:01.300 --> 52:06.580]  And Meg's like, tell him to go away. And I can just hear you stomping. Oh, the cat's in the way.
[52:06.960 --> 52:10.620]  And like, and then why did you get to the door? And I can hear you like opening the front door.
[52:10.640 --> 52:13.640]  And I'm like, this is going to end our friendship. And then I woke up.
[52:17.560 --> 52:22.560]  The saddest part about that dream is there's an alternate version where it's just the entire time
[52:22.560 --> 52:28.060]  Gavin's struggling with an unflushable toilet. That's the real loss. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm
[52:28.060 --> 52:32.860]  surprised you didn't hear me check in the breaker. No, none of that made it into the dream. It just
[52:32.860 --> 52:38.600]  wasn't even you trying to turn off my morning shit. No, no, I didn't know why I was there.
[52:38.740 --> 52:42.640]  And then I was so scared that I had inconvenienced you and Meg and that it was going to end our
[52:42.640 --> 52:46.940]  friendship. And you were so, and I was just like terrified hearing you stomp down a hallway.
[52:48.220 --> 52:51.740]  To get to the front door. And then right when you were about to let me have it, I woke up.
[52:52.080 --> 52:56.020]  I mean, that could all be real, except I, you would never be terrified.
[52:56.540 --> 53:01.160]  Yeah. I was going to ask, have you ever been intimidated by Gavin?
[53:03.740 --> 53:08.160]  No. Anyone ever has. I hit him too hard once and I felt really bad about it,
[53:08.160 --> 53:11.600]  but I wasn't intimidated. I just felt guilty. Oh, what was that one?
[53:11.600 --> 53:18.980]  It was when we were at MCM in London, me, you and Dan and I think Ben King were selling like
[53:18.980 --> 53:24.500]  griffballs out of a booth and I smacked you in the side of the head, but I hit you like on the ear
[53:24.500 --> 53:29.960]  really hard and it was solid. And you looked at me like, what the fuck is wrong with you?
[53:30.060 --> 53:33.380]  And I remember thinking, I shouldn't have done that. I feel bad. And then you shook it off.
[53:38.240 --> 53:39.800]  Did I get you back? Do you think?
[53:40.320 --> 53:41.220]  No, I don't think so.
[53:41.920 --> 53:45.340]  I think you were too mad to get me back. Or maybe you did and I never knew about it.
[53:47.260 --> 53:50.640]  That was the year we watched Dan pee in that vodka bottle and overfill it.
[53:51.640 --> 53:57.280]  Yeah. At those conventions, there wasn't that we knew about any sort of like vendor
[53:58.240 --> 54:02.700]  exclusive toilets. So you just kind of had to get in the big line and Dan was really busting.
[54:03.840 --> 54:08.360]  And he'd also just been slowly working his way through this bottle of vodka. I think all of us
[54:08.360 --> 54:11.620]  at the booth. And then he decided he would just piss in that. And it was like,
[54:11.760 --> 54:16.940]  it was a pretty sizable bottle. Yeah. But he underestimated the size of his bladder
[54:16.940 --> 54:21.740]  and he completely brimmed this bottle and he didn't know what to do. So he was just like,
[54:22.040 --> 54:28.840]  he was like, what do I do B? And then it just ended up with like the bottle cap in one hand,
[54:28.960 --> 54:32.360]  the bottle in the other, both of his hands went up and he just had to like
[54:32.880 --> 54:34.880]  ride it out. It was just pissing on the carpet.
[54:35.940 --> 54:36.340]  No.
[54:38.800 --> 54:41.660]  Three feet from people in the fucking line to buy t-shirts.
[54:41.940 --> 54:46.520]  Yeah. It was like round the back of the stuff. It was behind a wall of boxes and a curtain.
[54:47.660 --> 54:54.100]  What an animal. Oh man. Have you guys seen, uh, have you guys seen Jurassic Park? The new one?
[54:54.700 --> 55:04.440]  No. No. Emily and I saw it with our newfound time in Austin and it's not good. First off. And it's
[55:04.440 --> 55:08.560]  funny moments. Geoff Goldblum's funny. There's a few, it's got some terrible characters. Uh, I
[55:08.560 --> 55:14.140]  can't, I'd say it's about as bad as the previous one. Um, but you know, it's cool to see dinosaurs
[55:14.140 --> 55:18.680]  and stuff. But anyway, we were, we were seeing that out in the draft house and, uh, it was
[55:19.360 --> 55:24.900]  a fucking loud movie. Right. And then I, uh, I had been like slipping farts out all night long,
[55:24.940 --> 55:28.660]  you know, cause I was real gassy. And, uh, I think we'd eaten like Mexican food or something
[55:28.660 --> 55:32.560]  earlier. So I was just like ripping farts and, uh, but it's so fucking loud. Like dinosaurs
[55:32.560 --> 55:38.780]  are screaming and I'm just like, whatever. And, uh, I like, what are those, what are the dinosaurs
[55:38.780 --> 55:44.680]  that kill Newman in the first one? They spit shit at you. I don't know what they're called,
[55:44.920 --> 55:49.560]  but they terrified me. Campies or something like that. D? I think those are the little ones,
[55:49.660 --> 55:54.240]  the campies. Oh, okay. Whatever they are, those things. Campies got Peter Storm there. Yeah. Oh,
[55:54.240 --> 55:59.300]  right, right, right. So there's a scene where that dinosaur is about to spray on, uh, I think
[55:59.300 --> 56:04.040]  Laura Dern maybe, I don't remember, uh, one of the characters and it just gets like insanely quiet.
[56:04.640 --> 56:09.280]  And I just, I wasn't anticipating that part of it because it's been such a loud movie. So I like,
[56:09.620 --> 56:14.260]  like, right. Cause it's still pretty loud. I like, I like try to slip out a real quiet fart,
[56:14.560 --> 56:20.560]  but as Emily said, it sounded like ripping leather. It just was like, and it was right when
[56:20.560 --> 56:25.840]  that tense moment where the dinosaur and her face each other and the movie just goes completely
[56:25.840 --> 56:30.960]  silent. So all you could hear in the entire movie theater was my fart. And Emily goes,
[56:31.160 --> 56:38.380]  Oh my God. And then started laughing. And she didn't stop laughing. She was vibrating
[56:38.380 --> 56:43.480]  the entire rest of the movie for the next 22 minutes laughing. And I'm just going like,
[56:43.520 --> 56:47.680]  shut up, shut up, shut up. And everybody in the theater heard and hated me.
[56:48.300 --> 56:54.960]  Did anyone laugh? Nobody laughed but Emily. But you heard, you could hear Emily laughing for a long
[56:54.960 --> 56:59.520]  time. And I was like, I was just trying to hold it in because if I started laughing, it would have
[56:59.520 --> 57:05.380]  been over. And so I just like sat there and ate my laughs for like 20 minutes. And just while she
[57:05.380 --> 57:10.200]  just like, like fucking shook in her chair. Was this early enough in the movie that people were
[57:10.200 --> 57:14.540]  still eating? Uh, it was probably 30 minutes to go. Oh, okay. So everyone's probably done with
[57:14.540 --> 57:20.020]  their food. Probably done with their food at that point. Yeah. Dude, speaking of farts, I've, uh,
[57:20.380 --> 57:24.200]  I've started using a CPAP cause I did a sleep study and they were like, Oh, you know,
[57:24.200 --> 57:28.220]  got a little bit of apnea. Are you, can you do a surgery or something to eliminate it? Or are you
[57:28.220 --> 57:34.000]  just going to do CPAP? Uh, I think for you to try CPAP, see what goes on. Just obviously just wear
[57:34.000 --> 57:38.560]  a hose on the front of my face, going up my nose. And, and it's, I'm annoyed to be honest, that I've
[57:38.560 --> 57:45.260]  got sort of shrunken nostrils considering the size of my nose. It's like, uh, I imagine it like,
[57:45.300 --> 57:50.820]  you know, when you find old Aperture Science in Portal 2 and there's that giant vault door and
[57:50.820 --> 57:55.540]  and then you move the other way and it's just a regular like eight foot human door. That's my
[57:55.540 --> 58:01.520]  nostrils with the nose around it. So I've got this thing going over my head and it like sits
[58:01.520 --> 58:08.340]  under my nose and it ramps up the pressure. So it detects when you fall asleep, giving you like
[58:08.340 --> 58:14.340]  small pressure. And then when you fall asleep, it starts like really blasting air in. And, uh,
[58:14.940 --> 58:20.560]  I think it's like two hours after I fall asleep, I keep waking up completely full of air. It's not
[58:20.560 --> 58:26.640]  working right. At some point, I guess my throat is just going the wrong way and it is just
[58:27.100 --> 58:33.600]  filling my stomach with air. And I'm waking up like completely full, like a balloon. I keep
[58:33.600 --> 58:38.860]  waking up at like three in the morning, just like, oh God. And I'm there just like, I wake up and I
[58:38.860 --> 58:45.780]  pull the thing off my face. I'm like, and I do like a massive burp and I'm like, oh God. And
[58:45.780 --> 58:51.140]  I'm like, Googling, like my sleep app's filling me with air. And there's like, oh yeah, it's a
[58:51.140 --> 58:54.480]  pretty common thing that could happen. And I was really like, I have to get rid of it. It's just
[58:54.480 --> 58:59.620]  like, well, you know, sit on a toilet and just fart it all out. So I got up, it's like three
[58:59.620 --> 59:04.660]  in the morning and I'm not a big fart guy. I've got the wimpiest farts. Geoff can attest to this.
[59:05.040 --> 59:10.360]  I sat down at three in the morning on the bowl and it was just like,
[59:13.140 --> 59:20.960]  it was like an extended, sustained 45 second fart. And I'm just like feeling myself get smaller
[59:20.960 --> 59:26.780]  like a balloon. And I'm just like shrinking down as I'm farting. And a lot of it is still,
[59:27.320 --> 59:32.600]  it's quite satisfying to get all the air out. But I just don't know how to use the CPAP. I don't
[59:32.600 --> 59:37.840]  know why it's going down my esophagus. I can't keep it in my lungs. As soon as that thing kicks
[59:37.840 --> 59:46.440]  up to full pressure, it's just filling up my gut. So if there's any Pappas out there who have any
[59:46.440 --> 59:55.360]  tips. I think Gus and Jack both use it, if I'm not wrong. Jack had the surgery, didn't he? Maybe
[59:55.360 --> 59:58.200]  he doesn't use it anymore because he had the surgery, but I know he used to use the CPAP.
[59:58.440 --> 01:00:05.280]  I hate it and it's so uncomfortable and I've become a fart guy. I'm really sort of firing
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:11.220]  them out now. That's incredible. It sounds like you can replicate this. So you could set it up to
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:15.620]  record when you go to the bathroom and you can see how long of a fart you can do. Oh, definitely.
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:28.040]  Record your next bloated fart. There's this old Kenny versus Speddy episode where it's like these
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:32.520]  two guys that do competitions and one was like who could have the biggest fart and one of them
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:38.560]  shoved a hose up his ass and would blow air into it and then walk up and have these massive farts
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:42.620]  in front of the other guy just to intimidate him. You're just living that life. You're just
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:47.220]  naturally doing that. Trying to correct your sleep. I'm getting filled up in my sleep.
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.960]  Isn't it fucking bullshit that you try to do anything to make your life better and it just
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:57.540]  makes it worse? Like here you are, you're just trying to sleep better. So you get a CPAP machine
[01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:03.400]  and then it tries to kill you. Yeah, I'm just trying to sleep better. If we haven't explained
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:07.840]  sleep apnea, it's kind of where you just stop breathing in the night. You'd like snore and
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:14.960]  then you stop and the CPAP just keeps a constant pressure of air down your throat, down your lungs
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:19.520]  just to stop you from stopping breathing because it can lead to like strokes and all this bad crap.
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:25.500]  So I'm just trying to get ahead of that. But the way that the insurance works, it's like linked to
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:31.380]  their servers or whatever. So I need to use it for a minimum of four hours every night for like
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:36.020]  21 out of 30 nights. And I've had it for a week and I've not completed four hours just because
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:43.640]  I keep getting filled with air. Which means that if I don't meet the requirement, insurance doesn't
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:52.060]  pay for any more and I get billed for like $2,500 for this stupid what's basically an air pump for
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:02:00.900]  my gut. $2,500 to be filled with air. For nightly fart inflations. Yeah, it's bullshit.
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:09.340]  So any tips, welcome. So you went from not having any air to way too much air. There's no middle.
[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:14.580]  In all the wrong places. And I was hoping that it would make me feel more rested. I'm having the
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:20.860]  most miserable nights of sleep. It's all disjointed. I'm up for two hours and I'm farting for one hour
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:29.860]  and I'm back to sleep. Maybe you should try the flow the other way and stick the CPAP up your
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:40.360]  butt and try to blow the farts out the other side. Wow, this was quite an episode. We covered a lot
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:46.080]  of ground. I guess we should probably stop because Nick asked us to and I respect Nick in a way that
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:58.380]  I can't, Eric. So let me just say, Gavin, for your CPAP fart revelations, thank you. That has
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:07.340]  benefited the deep lore of F***face immensely. And Andrew, I cannot overstate how important it was
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:13.620]  that you secured the tuxedo. This is for Ripken's, believe it, because why not? New lines of business,
[01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:20.360]  there's no telling. Maybe we'll recreate the tuxedo shot for shot with Gavin in the tuxedo.
[01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:28.920]  Who knows? The possibilities are limitless. I just did a panel about podcasting as a business
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:34.600]  and video podcasting and stuff. And I used the Porta Potty as an example of how to thread merch
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:40.660]  and content together. And just going through all the stuff that we've done with the Porta Potty
[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:44.940]  and then all the things that we still can and potentially will do with the Porta Potty,
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:52.640]  from the phone box stuffing to the record, the vinyl, all that stuff. The tuxedo is like that
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:59.180]  times 10. I cannot imagine the content we'll have thanks to this tuxedo. What a great thing
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:03.640]  for the redemption year. What a great thing. And I'm telling you, you gotta get out a Greg
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:09.680]  free card with me, buddy, anytime you want. I'm excited to have that. I'm gonna remember that,
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:15.700]  I'm gonna keep that in my pocket. It's gonna be a clear thing. You could have shut me down,
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:19.900]  like that could have ended the tater tot thing right there. You could have just been like, boom.
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:27.420]  I'm excited to use that one day because I absolutely am going to need it. Undeniably,
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:32.180]  there will be more Gregging in the future by me. I like that we ended up with potentially
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:36.880]  two items for a museum. I don't know what's going to happen with Gavin's CPAP machine.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:41.100]  He needs to get a new machine. I think that's a fantastic museum piece.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:45.780]  Well, also, we'll have the waveform of him farting and we'll be able to display that.
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:53.160]  My CPAP goes mold in the freaking tuxedo. It looks like a heart getting adrenaline
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:58.380]  shoved into it. The waveform of it is massive spikes. Do you think that in the,
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:03.560]  like in the universe of the show, the tuxedo had a CPAP in it?
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:07.960]  He could have deployed whenever he needed it. I think he slept in it.
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:15.680]  It did everything. He just had to turn the dial. He had to turn the dial to CPAP.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:23.400]  I still want to know what mashed potatoes mode is. I'm still thinking about it. They never explain.
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:28.220]  What are the dials? Was that the mashed potatoes? I thought that was just dance. No,
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:32.620]  there was like a variety of options that they never use in the movie. Mashed potatoes is one
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:37.440]  of them. A mashed potato is a dance, but it could just be a fun... Wait, it is? It is, but it doesn't
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:41.460]  mean it had to be that dance. It could have been anything. If you hadn't blown it with the
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:46.800]  director, we could have asked him on this podcast. Well, you know, maybe this tuxedo is another
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:51.700]  bridge, another... I could extend another olive branch. Yeah, just be like, hey, just want you
[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:56.540]  to know we now own the tuxedo from the tuxedo. Also, one quick question. What was mashed potato
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:06:02.440]  mode? I think that was one of my last email I sent him had a variety of questions. That was
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:10.520]  one of them, I believe. What is it and how were they decided? All right, well, I guess we should
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:16.100]  probably wrap up. Thank you for listening to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:23.340]  I hope you've enjoyed it. This has been a lively one. If you did enjoy it or maybe you just,
[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:29.680]  I don't know, accepted that it happened, maybe you are totally ambivalent towards it. Maybe
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:34.240]  you didn't even think it was a particularly good episode. Either way, lie about it and tell
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:41.580]  somebody it was great. And then give us a bunch of stars. Bye. This dance sucks.
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:46.060]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack with a prediction of what is happening on next week's episode of
[01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:51.320]  F*** Face. Once again, the boys are behind. So here's a few guesses. Gavin lost his passport.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:57.640]  Pantin still won't go to Vegas. How do we clean the tuxedo? Let's promote Jack. It's time for a
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:02.960]  new challenge. And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil. All that and more on next week's
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.100]  episode of F*** Face.
