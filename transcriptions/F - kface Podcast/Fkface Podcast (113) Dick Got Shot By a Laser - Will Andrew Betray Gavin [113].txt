[00:15.420 --> 00:19.160]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:19.400 --> 00:22.780]  My name is Geoff Ramsey and with me as always Andrew Payton and Gavin Free.
[00:22.880 --> 00:30.220]  This is episode 113, season 4, year 3, chapter 1.
[00:30.940 --> 00:32.400]  And who else is here? Who did I say?
[00:32.720 --> 00:34.060]  You said Andrew, Gavin?
[00:34.300 --> 00:37.880]  I'm gonna be honest, this fell in the 30% where I wasn't listening.
[00:38.240 --> 00:39.900]  Oh, I guess Nick and Eric are here.
[00:40.360 --> 00:41.960]  Thanks for showing up, dickhead!
[00:42.400 --> 00:45.080]  Gavin, this is arguably worse than your first one.
[00:45.580 --> 00:50.940]  I was trying to get someone to serve it up and I was serving it to myself and I spiked it into the ground.
[00:51.440 --> 00:52.640]  Hold on, let's try again.
[00:53.480 --> 00:57.660]  With me as always, Gavin Free, Andrew Payton, and of course Nick is always here.
[00:57.720 --> 01:00.200]  Oh look who showed up today, Eric. Good to see you, buddy.
[01:00.740 --> 01:01.860]  Oh, you kind of said it in the...
[01:01.860 --> 01:04.480]  Yeah, you didn't set it up, you just followed through.
[01:05.820 --> 01:09.820]  Let's see, we got Gavin and Andrew as always, and then of course Nick and... oh, Eric.
[01:10.760 --> 01:12.440]  No, that's still... I don't think you understand.
[01:12.440 --> 01:14.280]  Yeah, I think you're still too much in one direction.
[01:14.300 --> 01:14.620]  You're still missing.
[01:16.180 --> 01:23.380]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, and with me as always, Gavin Free, Andrew Payton, Nick, and Eric.
[01:25.100 --> 01:27.640]  Look who decided to show up!
[01:31.460 --> 01:32.380]  Thanks, Andrew.
[01:32.580 --> 01:33.780]  You're welcome, I got you.
[01:37.440 --> 01:40.160]  That was worse than the first one.
[01:42.600 --> 01:49.740]  I was so excited, and no one gave it to me.
[01:50.940 --> 01:51.980]  Oh, God.
[01:52.860 --> 01:55.760]  Episode 103, I believe? Right?
[01:56.260 --> 01:57.820]  Yeah, he did that already.
[01:57.820 --> 02:02.520]  Anyway, so your dick got shot by a laser or something? I don't know how any of this works.
[02:02.860 --> 02:03.200]  What happened?
[02:03.460 --> 02:05.420]  Oh, you're talking about my... I got a vasectomy.
[02:06.800 --> 02:09.900]  What's today, Thursday? I got it on Tuesday morning.
[02:10.340 --> 02:13.620]  And let me tell you, it's no big deal. They said it was nothing to be worried about.
[02:14.140 --> 02:23.040]  I will tell you, I made one mistake, so if I can provide a little bit of knowledge for any prospective vasectomies.
[02:24.200 --> 02:28.740]  The way it went down is... by the way, I was in and out in 45 minutes. It is such a non-event.
[02:30.820 --> 02:33.500]  They gave me a Valium to take. I took a Valium.
[02:33.900 --> 02:38.200]  And then they were like, you should be good to go now. Just lay on this table.
[02:38.340 --> 02:40.880]  And I was like, oh, there's nothing else? And they were like, well, you can have laughing gas.
[02:41.520 --> 02:42.880]  And I was like, that sounds great, I'll do that.
[02:43.020 --> 02:45.240]  And they go, well, it's $95.
[02:45.820 --> 02:47.400]  And I was like, cool, I'll take three.
[02:47.400 --> 02:53.380]  I was like, give me an order of seven laughing gas.
[02:54.280 --> 02:56.460]  So anyway, I stick a little laughing gas to my mouth.
[02:56.480 --> 02:59.220]  And then I was just having a good time.
[03:00.360 --> 03:03.620]  Here's what I will say. Everything went fine. The doctor was really cool.
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.900]  The urologist, he talked a lot about jet skiing, actually, on Lake Austin.
[03:08.040 --> 03:09.500]  So we had jet skiing to talk about.
[03:10.040 --> 03:14.960]  But then at one point he goes, man, you did a really shitty job shaving your balls.
[03:15.340 --> 03:18.720]  And he didn't say it in a funny way. He was really agitated.
[03:18.940 --> 03:20.860]  And I was like, oh, man.
[03:21.260 --> 03:22.060]  Was that an instruction?
[03:22.620 --> 03:24.860]  Yeah, we were supposed to shave the area. And I thought I did.
[03:25.760 --> 03:28.240]  But not to his specifications.
[03:28.740 --> 03:33.240]  So here's what I say. If you're going to get a vasectomy, shave your balls really well, because they don't like it.
[03:33.300 --> 03:33.880]  They get annoyed.
[03:34.140 --> 03:38.220]  So what was the issue? You just missed big clumps or the stubble was too long?
[03:38.420 --> 03:41.000]  I guess stubble. I don't know. I didn't get into it.
[03:41.040 --> 03:42.940]  I mean, I was on a Valium and having gas.
[03:42.940 --> 03:47.720]  And he was like, he had like, you know, he'd cut my dick open and had tubes in it and stuff.
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.000]  So yeah, so that's really the hardest part.
[03:52.160 --> 04:01.720]  The hardest part about getting a vasectomy is the opprobrium that you hear from the urologist if you don't shave your balls well.
[04:02.020 --> 04:02.300]  So shave.
[04:02.480 --> 04:04.160]  It's so hard to shave the balls.
[04:04.400 --> 04:06.680]  I don't know how to do it right.
[04:06.940 --> 04:07.620]  Apparently, I don't either.
[04:08.520 --> 04:10.040]  So I can provide you with no guidance.
[04:10.400 --> 04:12.740]  Did you go wet shave or just a little buzz?
[04:12.740 --> 04:14.720]  I shaved in the shower with a straight razor.
[04:15.420 --> 04:18.640]  I don't like to use the buzzers because they always like straight razor and hurt.
[04:19.100 --> 04:20.340]  It's like a like a face razor.
[04:20.480 --> 04:20.640]  Yeah.
[04:21.060 --> 04:21.460]  Okay.
[04:21.600 --> 04:22.220]  That's different.
[04:22.440 --> 04:23.600]  Like a cutthroat barber.
[04:23.800 --> 04:26.120]  Not like you're not sweating your balls.
[04:26.240 --> 04:26.440]  Yeah.
[04:26.480 --> 04:26.920]  I'm not trying to.
[04:27.120 --> 04:27.720]  Yeah, exactly.
[04:29.100 --> 04:30.460]  This isn't Gangs of New York.
[04:31.580 --> 04:38.700]  I was thinking that scene in the Peter Pan Disney thing where like Smee is shaving the seagull by accident with that cutthroat razor.
[04:39.260 --> 04:39.740]  You know what I'm on about?
[04:40.200 --> 04:40.600]  No.
[04:41.400 --> 04:42.940]  Like the old animated one?
[04:43.340 --> 04:43.460]  Yeah.
[04:43.600 --> 04:48.800]  It's like sat on Captain Hook's towel and he thinks it's his head and then the seagull flies off and he thinks his head went.
[04:49.100 --> 04:50.280]  Oh, that's so familiar.
[04:50.820 --> 04:51.020]  Yeah.
[04:51.140 --> 04:51.620]  It's great.
[04:51.820 --> 04:52.660]  I loved it as a child.
[04:52.800 --> 04:53.300]  I haven't watched that.
[04:53.600 --> 04:59.880]  I'm just imagining Geoff like toweling up his balls with a warm towel and cracking them with a cutthroat.
[05:00.680 --> 05:05.180]  I'll tell you what is a little weird is I can feel the stitches in my balls depending on how I sit.
[05:05.480 --> 05:09.120]  And they're not painful, but it's just a weird feeling.
[05:09.120 --> 05:11.180]  Try to avoid feeling the stitches.
[05:11.480 --> 05:12.280]  Yeah, there it is.
[05:17.560 --> 05:20.020]  I don't think I've seen that in like 20 years.
[05:21.340 --> 05:25.400]  It kind of, there's a little bit of balls imagery to that as well.
[05:25.540 --> 05:27.940]  The way it looks like balls.
[05:28.220 --> 05:29.560]  Clearly doing a better job than I did.
[05:29.940 --> 05:33.560]  What a weird thing for your brain to remember to just have that ready to go.
[05:34.980 --> 05:36.300]  You don't have to know where I plucked that from.
[05:39.600 --> 05:40.880]  I'm going to be honest.
[05:41.700 --> 05:43.120]  I wasn't listening to part of that.
[05:43.240 --> 05:44.040]  Is the laser involved?
[05:44.620 --> 05:45.060]  You get zapped?
[05:45.200 --> 05:45.780]  I don't think so.
[05:45.960 --> 05:46.380]  No laser?
[05:46.920 --> 05:48.800]  Because I feel like I've heard the laser option before.
[05:48.920 --> 05:49.900]  I'll be honest.
[05:50.120 --> 05:54.500]  It was explained to me a bunch, but I don't hold on to a lot of information.
[05:55.280 --> 05:55.660]  That's fair.
[05:55.820 --> 05:57.540]  I was probably like, here's what happened.
[05:57.720 --> 05:59.760]  They explained the process to me at the time.
[05:59.880 --> 06:01.200]  And I thought that makes sense.
[06:01.280 --> 06:02.340]  That seems safe.
[06:02.520 --> 06:03.300]  That's acceptable.
[06:03.700 --> 06:05.500]  I no longer need to remember this process.
[06:05.500 --> 06:09.380]  I know that I have an incision on my shaft.
[06:09.960 --> 06:11.760]  Just where my shaft and my balls touch.
[06:12.140 --> 06:13.500]  It's got like five stitches in it.
[06:13.900 --> 06:17.760]  And I know that they went in there and they did something to my vas deferens.
[06:17.840 --> 06:20.580]  They cut it in half and cauterized it.
[06:20.640 --> 06:22.400]  Or put some titanium caps on it.
[06:22.620 --> 06:24.740]  Like the little ringlets that are on your shoelaces.
[06:28.240 --> 06:29.440]  Something along those lines.
[06:29.600 --> 06:30.960]  And now I don't make babies anymore.
[06:31.100 --> 06:32.820]  But I gotta jizz 60 times first.
[06:33.400 --> 06:34.880]  And I can't...
[06:34.880 --> 06:35.420]  Some like residue?
[06:36.060 --> 06:37.820]  Yeah, you gotta jizz like 30 times.
[06:38.000 --> 06:39.120]  And then give them a sample.
[06:39.360 --> 06:42.680]  And then jizz another 20 to 30 times.
[06:42.800 --> 06:44.160]  And then give them a second sample.
[06:44.720 --> 06:50.380]  And I'm not supposed to get an erection for another like six days.
[06:51.320 --> 06:52.720]  Oh, because it's bad for the skin?
[06:53.180 --> 06:54.940]  Well, I think you just don't...
[06:54.940 --> 06:58.280]  I mean, I think you might pull or tug or do something.
[06:58.560 --> 07:01.540]  I don't think you're supposed to be using those parts while they heal up on the inside too.
[07:02.520 --> 07:04.540]  But I also haven't felt like...
[07:05.380 --> 07:05.720]  Brandy?
[07:05.720 --> 07:07.460]  There have been a few moments, but yeah.
[07:08.200 --> 07:09.700]  But for the most part, it's...
[07:10.280 --> 07:11.380]  Yeah, you don't want to rip a stitch.
[07:11.920 --> 07:17.920]  Nick says, for the most part, you're just like honestly sitting on the couch with frozen peas on my nuts.
[07:18.600 --> 07:22.660]  Wait, so you have to wait a week before you have to start taking the shots?
[07:23.120 --> 07:28.260]  Yeah, they want you to wait about 8 to 14 days before you start popping off.
[07:30.340 --> 07:31.900]  And you gotta be real gentle.
[07:32.140 --> 07:33.120]  That's why you also...
[07:33.120 --> 07:36.320]  It's also like no jet skiing for at least a month.
[07:36.820 --> 07:38.240]  No bike riding for at least a month.
[07:38.420 --> 07:41.900]  Holy shit! I forgot, I got a fucking jet skiing story to tell you, dude.
[07:42.160 --> 07:42.600]  Oh, shit.
[07:42.620 --> 07:49.840]  So Sunday, I went jet skiing, impromptu jet skiing, when it was 113 degrees outside because Emily and I were bored to death.
[07:49.940 --> 07:51.280]  And we realized...
[07:51.280 --> 07:52.420]  We were like...
[07:52.420 --> 07:55.160]  She was like, you're not gonna be able to jet ski again for like another five or six weeks.
[07:55.220 --> 07:56.820]  And I was like, hey, that's a really good point.
[07:57.420 --> 07:59.960]  Because I won't be able to, you know, slam on my nuts.
[08:00.880 --> 08:02.180]  And she was like, let's...
[08:02.180 --> 08:05.220]  Do you want to just get one last jet ski in before you can't go anymore?
[08:05.320 --> 08:06.220]  And I was like, let's fucking go.
[08:06.400 --> 08:07.500]  So we raced down there.
[08:07.960 --> 08:09.180]  We knew it was gonna be hot.
[08:09.300 --> 08:10.180]  It was brutal.
[08:10.820 --> 08:12.740]  It was actually the least fun I've ever had jet skiing.
[08:13.160 --> 08:16.640]  I still had fun, but it was just like so many people out there and it was so choppy and hot.
[08:16.780 --> 08:17.580]  And it was just like...
[08:17.580 --> 08:18.220]  Couldn't get going...
[08:18.220 --> 08:20.300]  Couldn't go faster than like 30 the whole time, Gav.
[08:20.580 --> 08:22.640]  Because it was so choppy.
[08:22.800 --> 08:23.400]  Like I've never...
[08:23.400 --> 08:30.920]  Usually like the cool thing about jet skis is if it's like really choppy at like 20, 30 miles an hour, you get up to 50 and it just kind of goes over all that smooth.
[08:31.200 --> 08:32.280]  It was not like that.
[08:32.360 --> 08:33.520]  It was not doable.
[08:34.200 --> 08:35.660]  So it was actually a little stressful.
[08:36.800 --> 08:37.160]  But...
[08:37.160 --> 08:39.280]  Here's a fucking crazy jet ski story, dude.
[08:39.460 --> 08:41.120]  When we pull up and we...
[08:41.120 --> 08:45.960]  And, you know, the dude shows up with four or six jet skis on a trailer.
[08:46.580 --> 08:49.000]  And then you like have the conversations and you sign the paperwork.
[08:49.260 --> 08:51.520]  And then he like puts you on jet skis and throws you in the water.
[08:51.520 --> 08:57.800]  Well, the jet ski that you used the last time, Gavin, in the high five video, that jet ski...
[08:57.800 --> 08:57.980]  Yeah.
[08:58.320 --> 09:00.480]  Was fucked up.
[09:00.580 --> 09:01.480]  It was on the...
[09:01.480 --> 09:02.600]  It was on the...
[09:02.600 --> 09:03.860]  It was on the trailer.
[09:04.060 --> 09:07.460]  And the handlebars were like hanging off to the side.
[09:07.660 --> 09:09.720]  And the front was all dented in.
[09:09.900 --> 09:12.840]  And it just looked like part of the engine was like hanging off.
[09:12.900 --> 09:13.940]  And it looked fucked up.
[09:13.940 --> 09:15.520]  Someone wrecked my jet ski.
[09:15.720 --> 09:17.840]  And Emily goes, oh my God, what happened?
[09:17.920 --> 09:18.800]  What happened to that jet ski?
[09:18.800 --> 09:21.540]  And he goes, oh, yesterday we had a whole fucking thing.
[09:22.980 --> 09:28.800]  Apparently, some people rented the jet skis and they were trying...
[09:29.560 --> 09:31.140]  Listen, this is insane.
[09:31.360 --> 09:37.560]  First off, they got into a mid-air collision going 40 miles an hour.
[09:38.140 --> 09:38.500]  Oh no.
[09:39.060 --> 09:40.980]  And they said, yeah, we don't understand it.
[09:41.040 --> 09:42.180]  This is what the jet ski guy told us.
[09:42.200 --> 09:45.380]  He was like, yeah, they said like, yeah, we were only going about 40 when we hit.
[09:45.460 --> 09:46.580]  So we didn't think it'd be that bad.
[09:46.980 --> 09:48.420]  I don't know if you've ever been in a jet ski.
[09:48.540 --> 09:51.560]  40 miles an hour in a jet ski is very fucking fast.
[09:52.800 --> 09:58.720]  And the way they did this was apparently they were jumping on the same wake.
[09:59.180 --> 10:02.080]  Like on the same wave and at 40 miles an hour.
[10:02.180 --> 10:03.840]  So they were that close to each other.
[10:03.860 --> 10:04.860]  So they were on the same wave.
[10:05.220 --> 10:07.780]  And so the wave pushed them together in the air and they collided.
[10:07.940 --> 10:09.940]  And one of them broke their fucking arm.
[10:09.940 --> 10:12.900]  And they had to be like pulled out of the water and like medevaced out.
[10:13.220 --> 10:15.200]  Oh Jesus, that could have been us.
[10:15.200 --> 10:16.900]  No, because we're not idiots.
[10:17.100 --> 10:17.980]  I mean, we're close.
[10:18.620 --> 10:22.440]  When we do high fives, we do it at a high five miles an hour.
[10:24.240 --> 10:29.680]  We do it at a speed where the only other person who might be excited that we high fived on jet skis goes,
[10:30.220 --> 10:31.480]  Ah, pretty underwhelming.
[10:32.580 --> 10:36.020]  I don't want to make light of this because it sounds like somebody was seriously hurt.
[10:36.200 --> 10:39.940]  But the entire time I was just waiting for a swan attack to be responsible for what happened.
[10:39.960 --> 10:42.660]  I looked all over for the swan. It wasn't around.
[10:43.020 --> 10:44.140]  I think it was probably too hot for the swan.
[10:44.140 --> 10:47.660]  But yeah, so there is proof right there.
[10:48.340 --> 10:51.940]  Hitting each other at 40 miles an hour, not a good idea.
[10:52.600 --> 10:53.440]  What about 35?
[10:55.080 --> 10:56.160]  We'll have to find out.
[10:56.600 --> 10:58.060]  35 seems much safer to me.
[10:59.260 --> 11:02.000]  That is crazy. I can't believe they're alive.
[11:02.540 --> 11:07.360]  Collided in the air at 40 miles an hour and just destroyed that fucking jet ski, dude.
[11:07.880 --> 11:09.040]  I wonder what the ankle was.
[11:09.860 --> 11:10.540]  I don't know.
[11:10.540 --> 11:12.300]  The other one seemed fine.
[11:12.400 --> 11:14.500]  I rode the other one and it was totally fine.
[11:16.240 --> 11:18.940]  That's what happened to Hulk Hogan in Baywatch.
[11:19.440 --> 11:20.460]  Macho Man almost killed him.
[11:20.560 --> 11:23.680]  They were riding off the same wave and they went up above and Macho Man landed on Hulk Hogan.
[11:24.220 --> 11:25.440]  He got knocked unconscious.
[11:26.300 --> 11:27.700]  Pamela Anderson saved Hulk Hogan.
[11:28.280 --> 11:30.000]  I think it was probably similar to that.
[11:30.300 --> 11:34.860]  Yeah, I guess if we need a visual recreation of probably what happened, Baywatch is our source.
[11:34.960 --> 11:35.560]  We got this.
[11:36.360 --> 11:37.980]  You go to the experts.
[11:37.980 --> 11:38.600]  Yes.
[11:40.580 --> 11:43.680]  Speaking of vehicles, I meant to ask this in the last one we recorded.
[11:43.920 --> 11:45.300]  Do you have a car now, Geoff?
[11:45.840 --> 11:47.000]  Yeah, I got my car back.
[11:47.140 --> 11:49.880]  Okay, your car is good? It didn't get crashed again on the way?
[11:50.060 --> 11:54.660]  No, the one crash was the only crash.
[11:55.080 --> 12:01.060]  Although I will say, those motherfuckers couldn't be any further away from me in Austin.
[12:01.280 --> 12:03.120]  Like the absolute ass into town.
[12:05.400 --> 12:08.800]  So I made them bring it to me.
[12:08.960 --> 12:11.460]  Because I was like, you guys fucking wrecked my car, you can bring it to me.
[12:11.520 --> 12:12.300]  And they were like, okay.
[12:12.500 --> 12:14.540]  So they bring it to me. They were actually nice about it, I appreciate it.
[12:14.840 --> 12:16.960]  And then I got a call like...
[12:16.960 --> 12:22.020]  Or I got a text like two days later and they go, hey, we just realized we have all your tennis balls.
[12:22.120 --> 12:23.220]  We're really sorry about that.
[12:23.340 --> 12:25.720]  We took them out of the trunk, I guess, and we forgot to put them back in.
[12:25.920 --> 12:28.040]  So I ran and checked and sure enough, all my tennis balls are gone.
[12:28.080 --> 12:30.200]  I have like 60 tennis balls in my trunk.
[12:30.500 --> 12:32.020]  Because, you know, I play tennis.
[12:32.960 --> 12:34.820]  And my rackets are still there, thank God.
[12:35.540 --> 12:37.620]  And he goes, do you want us to bring them by?
[12:37.740 --> 12:39.700]  And I go, well, yeah, obviously.
[12:39.900 --> 12:40.800]  I want my fucking tennis balls.
[12:41.060 --> 12:41.640]  And he's like, okay.
[12:41.740 --> 12:44.260]  And then I didn't hear anything for like five days.
[12:44.420 --> 12:47.560]  And then I get another text and the guy goes, hey, we're real busy.
[12:47.660 --> 12:48.100]  I'm real sorry.
[12:48.200 --> 12:50.400]  I don't know when we're going to be able to get those tennis balls to you.
[12:50.580 --> 12:51.940]  If you want to come get them.
[12:52.700 --> 12:54.960]  And I was like, just bring them when you can.
[12:55.040 --> 12:56.040]  I'm not driving down there.
[12:56.280 --> 12:57.220]  It's your fuck up.
[12:57.800 --> 13:01.280]  And they're like, oh, well, we'll see when we can.
[13:01.760 --> 13:02.780]  We'll try to figure something out.
[13:02.820 --> 13:04.160]  And I'm like, see that you do. Thank you.
[13:04.400 --> 13:05.820]  Being firm. Putting your foot down.
[13:06.000 --> 13:07.740]  Wreck my car and steal my tennis balls?
[13:08.800 --> 13:09.900]  No. No, sir.
[13:10.280 --> 13:11.580]  That's a lot of tennis balls.
[13:11.900 --> 13:12.220]  It is.
[13:12.560 --> 13:16.820]  I've played tennis. I feel like I'd never have more than six.
[13:17.040 --> 13:24.300]  Well, what you can do is when you start tennis, you can go to a place like Play It Again Sports in Austin and buy a whole bunch of used tennis balls for cheap.
[13:24.460 --> 13:24.920]  Got it. Okay.
[13:24.920 --> 13:25.840]  That's what I did.
[13:26.060 --> 13:29.260]  I greatly misunderstood tennis when I first started playing.
[13:29.380 --> 13:32.000]  I started playing when I was like, I don't know, six or something like that.
[13:32.080 --> 13:33.820]  And I thought power. It was all about power.
[13:33.960 --> 13:35.600]  It's the opposite of what you want.
[13:35.800 --> 13:37.400]  I was playing it like it was baseball.
[13:37.600 --> 13:39.920]  And so I just hit it as hard as I could.
[13:40.100 --> 13:41.320]  Every time it came to me.
[13:41.420 --> 13:43.080]  I was like you with the baseballs, Geoff.
[13:43.120 --> 13:44.400]  I was hitting them at the court.
[13:44.500 --> 13:46.740]  I was just hitting them as fast and as hard as I could.
[13:47.180 --> 13:48.760]  Fly out. They hated me.
[13:49.180 --> 13:50.900]  I didn't play properly at all.
[13:51.560 --> 13:54.540]  I would hit them out of the court and be like, yeah, I did it.
[13:54.540 --> 13:56.700]  Great job. I got so proud of myself.
[13:56.820 --> 13:57.500]  Do you still play?
[13:57.780 --> 14:00.000]  I haven't played in a long time, no. I don't actively play.
[14:00.880 --> 14:02.100]  Does that answer your question?
[14:02.300 --> 14:04.940]  Probably wouldn't do you any favors for the marathon.
[14:05.380 --> 14:06.580]  No. Would not be helpful.
[14:06.820 --> 14:08.300]  Yeah, you gotta work on those ankles.
[14:08.420 --> 14:09.240]  You gotta protect those ankles, man.
[14:09.360 --> 14:12.060]  Yeah, you gotta put the bubble wrap.
[14:12.440 --> 14:14.040]  Bubble wrap everything. Bubble wrap the court.
[14:15.700 --> 14:19.060]  I wonder how long you run in a game like tennis.
[14:19.600 --> 14:20.520]  Like if you track that.
[14:20.680 --> 14:21.860]  What the average distance is.
[14:21.860 --> 14:22.920]  Yeah, total distance.
[14:23.420 --> 14:29.000]  I imagine soccer would be the largest total distance moved per game.
[14:29.380 --> 14:30.580]  Yeah, it's gotta be several miles.
[14:30.960 --> 14:31.760]  You'd think, yeah.
[14:32.200 --> 14:37.520]  I'd love to know how much like a star soccer player runs in distance in a season.
[14:38.000 --> 14:39.460]  How many marathons they do.
[14:39.680 --> 14:41.320]  Seems like Google could probably answer that.
[14:41.660 --> 14:43.500]  Yeah, probably. I just never considered it.
[14:43.660 --> 14:46.040]  What do you think the opposite of that is in the sports world?
[14:46.700 --> 14:46.940]  Darts?
[14:46.960 --> 14:49.060]  The least amount of movement? Darts is pretty good.
[14:49.060 --> 14:49.760]  Curling.
[14:50.440 --> 14:50.880]  Curling.
[14:53.200 --> 14:53.640]  Bowling.
[14:55.460 --> 14:58.660]  Golf is probably the most distance with least effort.
[14:59.440 --> 15:00.480]  Going from place to place.
[15:01.040 --> 15:03.280]  Yeah, and you're just walking down the course.
[15:03.280 --> 15:05.440]  Eric wrote tennis match 4-5 miles.
[15:06.020 --> 15:06.200]  Wow.
[15:07.140 --> 15:07.580]  Volleyball.
[15:08.040 --> 15:10.660]  No, no, tetherball. I meant tetherball.
[15:10.760 --> 15:11.940]  I said volleyball, I meant tetherball.
[15:12.260 --> 15:14.440]  Oh yeah, there's not a whole hell of a lot of movement in tetherball.
[15:14.800 --> 15:16.060]  What, that's just the ball and the string?
[15:16.060 --> 15:17.820]  Yeah, where it has to go around.
[15:17.980 --> 15:19.060]  You're trying to get it to loop.
[15:20.100 --> 15:23.480]  Hey Gavin, I just remembered. I was supposed to ask this last episode, I wrote it down.
[15:24.320 --> 15:26.280]  How are your CPAP farts going?
[15:26.380 --> 15:27.560]  And have you recorded any?
[15:28.220 --> 15:29.840]  No, well I didn't take it to England.
[15:31.320 --> 15:34.060]  So I immediately voided all of my insurance.
[15:34.980 --> 15:35.780]  Oh no!
[15:36.600 --> 15:38.440]  Because it took me over the...
[15:38.440 --> 15:40.340]  Not that I finished any full nights anyway.
[15:40.560 --> 15:44.660]  But I just thought because I am now paying for it, I haven't bothered to use it again yet.
[15:44.660 --> 15:50.080]  I'm going to try a full face mask instead of the just under the nose one.
[15:50.180 --> 15:53.240]  That was the suggestion from a lot of the CPAPers out there.
[15:53.320 --> 15:54.160]  The CPAPars.
[15:54.980 --> 15:56.100]  Please keep us updated.
[15:56.620 --> 16:00.660]  I had a situation the other day where I was trying to crawl out of bed.
[16:00.780 --> 16:01.500]  I had to use the bathroom.
[16:01.660 --> 16:04.200]  So I was trying to crawl out of bed and not make too much noise.
[16:04.660 --> 16:10.740]  So I'm crawling out of bed and every literal crawl down, I'm like, you know what, I'm going to be quiet.
[16:10.860 --> 16:11.840]  I'm going to be very selective.
[16:11.840 --> 16:14.620]  Every time I moved backwards, I farted.
[16:15.060 --> 16:16.480]  And it sounded like a duck call.
[16:16.620 --> 16:18.880]  It was so loud, but also like short.
[16:19.100 --> 16:21.000]  And it happened four times in a row.
[16:21.180 --> 16:22.120]  It was disastrous.
[16:22.540 --> 16:23.920]  Why did you keep doing it?
[16:24.200 --> 16:25.640]  Well, no, because I was trying to move out of bed.
[16:25.700 --> 16:26.420]  I wasn't on purpose.
[16:26.580 --> 16:28.780]  Just every time I moved, a duck call came out.
[16:28.900 --> 16:32.680]  It was blowing a duck whistle in my ass as I was trying to get out of bed.
[16:33.100 --> 16:33.780]  It was very loud.
[16:33.940 --> 16:34.900]  It was not sneaky at all.
[16:34.940 --> 16:36.680]  But it made me think, you know, loud farts.
[16:37.300 --> 16:41.220]  So wait, you're four backwards crawls away from getting out of bed?
[16:42.720 --> 16:44.160]  Uh, yeah, I guess I was.
[16:44.200 --> 16:44.700]  Yeah, I was.
[16:44.920 --> 16:46.140]  To get from the top to the bottom.
[16:46.340 --> 16:49.760]  Oh, because you're starting up pillow mountain.
[16:49.860 --> 16:51.300]  Yeah, because I'm on top of a mountain.
[16:51.400 --> 16:52.160]  I need to descend.
[16:52.580 --> 16:53.620]  I need to acclimate.
[16:53.880 --> 16:55.320]  So there's a little pause, two down.
[16:56.080 --> 16:58.280]  Three farts to get down the mountain and one to get out of bed.
[16:58.540 --> 16:59.300]  Yeah, exactly.
[17:00.340 --> 17:01.180]  Yeah, it was four.
[17:01.260 --> 17:02.760]  I just remember four duck calls.
[17:03.120 --> 17:03.960]  Did you wake anyone up?
[17:04.540 --> 17:06.980]  Uh, probably. Almost certainly I did.
[17:06.980 --> 17:09.040]  But yeah, there's no...
[17:09.040 --> 17:10.980]  That's one of the biggest problems in your life.
[17:11.180 --> 17:13.000]  Just navigating your room.
[17:13.620 --> 17:14.740]  In the dark at night.
[17:15.560 --> 17:16.040]  Quietly.
[17:16.600 --> 17:18.840]  I'm disappointed. I wish there were more farts.
[17:19.260 --> 17:20.680]  In your life. I was enjoying.
[17:20.800 --> 17:21.500]  This made me happy.
[17:23.380 --> 17:24.100]  That's great.
[17:24.260 --> 17:26.240]  I hope it works for you.
[17:26.500 --> 17:27.040]  As your friend.
[17:27.580 --> 17:30.500]  But there's also 20% of me that hopes it's somehow worse.
[17:30.840 --> 17:31.600]  Just 20?
[17:32.200 --> 17:33.020]  Just 20.
[17:33.020 --> 17:35.520]  Man, there's something wrong with me.
[17:35.680 --> 17:35.900]  Okay.
[17:37.220 --> 17:38.620]  Well, there are certain things.
[17:39.520 --> 17:41.520]  Certain failings that exist in the world
[17:41.520 --> 17:43.540]  that make me happy to know that they're there.
[17:43.640 --> 17:45.520]  Because I can just assume that they've happened.
[17:45.760 --> 17:46.420]  Like you...
[17:46.420 --> 17:48.440]  I'm assuming you still haven't fixed
[17:48.440 --> 17:50.820]  if your doorbell rings while you're sitting on your toilet
[17:50.820 --> 17:51.960]  that it can't flush.
[17:53.040 --> 17:55.320]  That's just a thing that exists in the world
[17:55.320 --> 17:56.300]  that keeps me happy.
[17:56.660 --> 17:58.180]  I might be having a tough moment
[17:58.180 --> 17:59.280]  and then I'll think about the fact
[17:59.280 --> 18:01.300]  that you might be sitting on the toilet right now
[18:01.300 --> 18:02.520]  that is unflushable.
[18:03.600 --> 18:04.440]  It's great.
[18:06.400 --> 18:07.480]  I love that as well
[18:07.480 --> 18:09.200]  that that wasn't what Geoff's dream was about.
[18:09.700 --> 18:11.380]  No! No, not at all.
[18:11.520 --> 18:13.800]  My dream was just about you being mad at me
[18:13.800 --> 18:15.540]  because I inconvenienced you
[18:15.540 --> 18:17.340]  by knocking on the door at the wrong time of the day.
[18:17.860 --> 18:19.500]  I saw an interesting comment.
[18:19.680 --> 18:20.980]  What would your reaction be
[18:20.980 --> 18:22.760]  if Geoff actually did that, Gavin?
[18:22.840 --> 18:24.940]  If he was there way too early for no reason
[18:24.940 --> 18:25.940]  and woke you up?
[18:26.700 --> 18:27.760]  In real life?
[18:28.020 --> 18:29.640]  Yeah, in real life. What would your reaction be?
[18:30.580 --> 18:31.960]  I'd just be concerned, I think.
[18:32.060 --> 18:32.940]  You think you'd be annoyed?
[18:33.320 --> 18:34.120]  No, I wouldn't be annoyed.
[18:35.760 --> 18:36.960]  Never going to happen.
[18:37.580 --> 18:37.940]  Never.
[18:39.880 --> 18:40.800]  Not a concern.
[18:42.060 --> 18:43.160]  Yeah, I'd probably be like,
[18:43.180 --> 18:43.960]  Oh, someone's died.
[18:44.520 --> 18:47.360]  That would be your assumption if Geoff showed up to your house early
[18:47.360 --> 18:48.520]  that somebody's dead?
[18:48.880 --> 18:51.380]  Hey man, I'm here at your house to let you know somebody died.
[18:53.040 --> 18:54.520]  Well, I would assume I'm getting in the car.
[18:54.520 --> 18:55.760]  I could have called or texted,
[18:55.900 --> 18:57.220]  but this seems more intimate.
[18:59.500 --> 18:59.940]  I don't know,
[19:00.000 --> 19:01.540]  that's how I feel if my phone rings.
[19:02.060 --> 19:03.700]  I want to break your heart
[19:03.700 --> 19:04.520]  face-to-face.
[19:06.080 --> 19:07.620]  Yeah, that's a weird...
[19:08.200 --> 19:09.680]  that's a weird move
[19:09.680 --> 19:11.460]  to say somebody's dead.
[19:12.080 --> 19:14.000]  Well, I mean, who just shows up unannounced?
[19:14.320 --> 19:15.620]  Anyway, have a good day.
[19:15.680 --> 19:16.240]  I'll see you later.
[19:18.280 --> 19:20.380]  Also, here's this cucumber
[19:20.380 --> 19:21.240]  I remember somebody left.
[19:21.720 --> 19:21.840]  What?
[19:22.340 --> 19:24.160]  Is this here?
[19:25.800 --> 19:27.400]  I don't want to...
[19:27.400 --> 19:28.960]  That sounds terrible.
[19:29.260 --> 19:30.500]  I hate this thing that you've created.
[19:31.520 --> 19:32.840]  I don't think I would go to...
[19:32.840 --> 19:36.120]  I fortunately have not had to tell anybody that anyone has died.
[19:36.320 --> 19:36.980]  That's not true.
[19:37.220 --> 19:38.060]  That actually isn't true.
[19:38.200 --> 19:40.880]  But I didn't have to knock on a door.
[19:41.620 --> 19:43.380]  I don't want to travel to do that.
[19:43.940 --> 19:45.180]  No, nobody's making you.
[19:45.740 --> 19:47.080]  I think it's a phone call.
[19:47.080 --> 19:47.780]  Yeah.
[19:48.720 --> 19:50.780]  I think it's a phone call.
[19:51.200 --> 19:52.360]  But do you leave a message?
[19:52.880 --> 19:54.180]  If it goes to voicemail,
[19:54.320 --> 19:55.780]  is that messageable?
[19:56.000 --> 19:57.800]  Or do you have to be talking to the person?
[19:58.100 --> 19:58.680]  I think it's like,
[19:58.880 --> 20:00.600]  Hey, Gav, it's Geoff.
[20:01.740 --> 20:03.280]  I know you're probably busy right now,
[20:03.300 --> 20:04.680]  but I really need to talk to you.
[20:04.860 --> 20:06.660]  So if you can call me back when you get a chance.
[20:07.520 --> 20:09.000]  Okay, so you're not saying
[20:09.000 --> 20:10.820]  the person is dead in the voicemail.
[20:11.180 --> 20:12.500]  You're saying you need to talk.
[20:12.500 --> 20:14.100]  Hey, Gav, it's Geoff.
[20:14.280 --> 20:15.580]  I got some weird news about Andrew.
[20:15.780 --> 20:16.380]  Call me back.
[20:18.000 --> 20:18.800]  Weird news?
[20:19.800 --> 20:21.080]  That's by far the worst.
[20:21.520 --> 20:22.720]  It's like, what is that gonna be?
[20:24.340 --> 20:26.000]  It's definitely bad, but it's weird.
[20:26.380 --> 20:27.740]  I like the delivery of,
[20:27.860 --> 20:29.240]  what was it, Lambeer?
[20:29.380 --> 20:30.700]  The guy in office space?
[20:30.800 --> 20:33.300]  It's like, yeah, you're gonna have to come in on the weekend.
[20:33.400 --> 20:35.140]  The way you deliver that is the same.
[20:36.020 --> 20:38.100]  Eh, somebody died.
[20:38.380 --> 20:38.720]  That you know.
[20:39.520 --> 20:40.300]  So anyway,
[20:40.800 --> 20:42.560]  if you're free to jet ski
[20:42.560 --> 20:44.200]  on Tuesday or Thursday.
[20:44.700 --> 20:46.540]  Anyway, it's been forever since we had dinner together
[20:46.540 --> 20:47.400]  if you want to go to the
[20:48.660 --> 20:49.540]  place we love.
[20:49.920 --> 20:51.280]  Did you see that document that
[20:52.080 --> 20:54.920]  I think it ended up in the subreddit
[20:54.920 --> 20:56.780]  for F***face, but it was like
[20:56.780 --> 20:58.500]  a Reddit combined list of
[20:58.500 --> 21:00.740]  set up words, and I'll just post
[21:00.740 --> 21:01.400]  the thing on the Slack.
[21:01.740 --> 21:04.020]  I have no idea what you're talking about.
[21:04.160 --> 21:06.380]  It's basically on one column you've got words like
[21:06.380 --> 21:08.320]  dumb and shit and
[21:08.320 --> 21:10.520]  dick, and on the top you've got ass
[21:10.520 --> 21:12.140]  and bag, and basically
[21:12.140 --> 21:14.500]  F***face is a very popular
[21:14.500 --> 21:15.880]  combination on that grid.
[21:16.380 --> 21:18.320]  But I just looked at that grid and
[21:18.320 --> 21:20.320]  I thought, this is a great opportunity to
[21:20.320 --> 21:22.420]  create some new insults based on the least
[21:23.300 --> 21:23.780]  combined.
[21:24.920 --> 21:26.320]  Like out of this grid you can
[21:26.320 --> 21:27.980]  pull insults like
[21:28.980 --> 21:30.400]  scumwit and dirt hat
[21:30.400 --> 21:32.160]  and wank clown or
[21:32.160 --> 21:33.860]  dip goblin. I think they're all
[21:35.260 --> 21:35.740]  massively
[21:35.740 --> 21:37.240]  underused insults now.
[21:37.820 --> 21:38.840]  Piss sucker from Eric.
[21:39.380 --> 21:41.980]  It's always weird what people latch onto and how some words
[21:41.980 --> 21:43.840]  are just meant for other words and that's it.
[21:44.740 --> 21:45.880]  Yeah. I really
[21:45.880 --> 21:46.980]  like scumwit.
[21:48.300 --> 21:48.780]  Scumwit!
[21:49.580 --> 21:51.900]  Maybe we're like an insult
[21:51.900 --> 21:53.820]  invention podcast now. Maybe we just invent
[21:53.820 --> 21:55.300]  new insults. It's difficult.
[21:55.760 --> 21:57.900]  I'm worried with this idea existing with
[21:57.900 --> 21:59.940]  the sock idea. I don't need socks that say
[21:59.940 --> 22:01.620]  that. We don't want to popularize.
[22:01.620 --> 22:03.620]  Oh, should this be the word
[22:03.620 --> 22:03.900]  grid?
[22:05.220 --> 22:07.560]  I will just take two
[22:07.560 --> 22:08.640]  at a time from Smee.
[22:09.560 --> 22:10.060]  Yeah.
[22:11.460 --> 22:13.720]  Honey, where's my piss fuck socks?
[22:15.880 --> 22:18.420]  I'm never wearing the piss fuck socks again.
[22:18.600 --> 22:19.460]  I've got that important dinner tonight.
[22:19.980 --> 22:20.580]  They're cursed.
[22:21.640 --> 22:23.600]  Every time I wear my piss fuck
[22:23.600 --> 22:25.580]  socks, somebody knocks on
[22:25.580 --> 22:27.220]  my door and says someone's tied.
[22:30.100 --> 22:31.320]  First time I thought
[22:31.320 --> 22:32.820]  it was unfortunate, but twice!
[22:34.640 --> 22:35.280]  I've much better luck
[22:35.280 --> 22:36.820]  with my Trump nozzle socks.
[22:42.410 --> 22:43.550]  What a weird
[22:43.550 --> 22:44.890]  I really
[22:44.890 --> 22:47.330]  I really think that there's something to these
[22:47.330 --> 22:47.770]  socks.
[22:48.410 --> 22:49.970]  I know you do.
[22:50.430 --> 22:51.930]  There's zero doubt that you do.
[22:52.210 --> 22:53.690]  That was never in question.
[22:54.170 --> 22:55.550]  You're all about the socks.
[22:56.850 --> 22:58.690]  This is an interesting episode to record
[22:58.690 --> 22:59.570]  because this will
[23:00.250 --> 23:02.690]  come out two weeks from now, I believe.
[23:02.770 --> 23:04.230]  I think the last one's next week, right?
[23:04.890 --> 23:05.570]  And this
[23:06.650 --> 23:08.810]  upcoming week, Gavin and I
[23:08.810 --> 23:10.130]  are in Survive Block Island.
[23:10.570 --> 23:12.350]  And we won't be able to talk about it
[23:12.350 --> 23:14.790]  for quite a while, but there are
[23:14.790 --> 23:16.690]  things that could happen in that show
[23:17.310 --> 23:18.790]  that could impact
[23:18.790 --> 23:20.630]  how we interact with each other going
[23:20.630 --> 23:21.890]  forward for some amount of time.
[23:22.530 --> 23:24.690]  You mean it may affect our friendship going forward forever?
[23:24.870 --> 23:26.430]  Temporarily. Well, I don't know about forever.
[23:26.430 --> 23:27.150]  I do.
[23:28.050 --> 23:30.350]  You think so? I'm counting on it.
[23:30.910 --> 23:32.550]  I think this is sort of an interesting
[23:32.550 --> 23:34.350]  point to like... Well, let me ask you
[23:34.350 --> 23:35.710]  honestly right now before it all starts.
[23:36.270 --> 23:38.270]  Are you going to stab me in the back? No.
[23:38.850 --> 23:39.850]  This is my belief.
[23:40.210 --> 23:42.290]  And we'll see what happens. I have
[23:42.290 --> 23:44.390]  no intention on stabbing you in the back.
[23:45.010 --> 23:46.090]  I don't think we'll
[23:46.930 --> 23:48.290]  be on the same team,
[23:48.410 --> 23:49.190]  would be my guess.
[23:50.050 --> 23:52.090]  So we'd have to make merch, in my assumption,
[23:52.430 --> 23:53.850]  for us to play together.
[23:53.850 --> 23:55.810]  But I have no intention on
[23:55.810 --> 23:57.850]  stabbing you in the back, but feel like
[23:57.850 --> 24:00.090]  you will probably stab me in the back
[24:00.090 --> 24:01.770]  out of the assumption that I plan on
[24:01.770 --> 24:03.570]  stabbing you in the back. That is my prediction.
[24:04.110 --> 24:05.710]  Hmm. I feel like I'm quite
[24:05.710 --> 24:07.690]  trustworthy as a friend. Yeah,
[24:07.770 --> 24:08.990]  I gotta... I gotta
[24:09.710 --> 24:11.410]  step in and say that
[24:11.410 --> 24:13.870]  in the grand scheme of things, I think
[24:13.870 --> 24:15.850]  Andrew is gonna stab Gavin
[24:15.850 --> 24:17.790]  in the back 11 times before Gavin
[24:17.790 --> 24:19.070]  considers doing it once.
[24:19.650 --> 24:21.750]  I think I'll have a knife in my back before
[24:21.750 --> 24:23.510]  I know what the teams are. Yeah.
[24:23.590 --> 24:24.670]  That's absolutely not true.
[24:25.110 --> 24:27.150]  I just wanna, like...
[24:27.150 --> 24:29.510]  This is gonna be clipped out later when
[24:29.510 --> 24:31.870]  Andrew inevitably stabs Gavin in the back.
[24:32.410 --> 24:33.690]  And I just want everyone to
[24:33.690 --> 24:35.770]  listen to the way Andrew set up
[24:35.770 --> 24:36.950]  everything that he did.
[24:37.610 --> 24:39.210]  This is his belief.
[24:39.490 --> 24:41.010]  He has no intention.
[24:41.470 --> 24:43.810]  He thinks Gavin might betray him
[24:43.810 --> 24:45.710]  because Gavin thinks
[24:45.710 --> 24:47.650]  that Andrew's going to be the one who
[24:47.650 --> 24:49.890]  betrays... It is all set up
[24:49.890 --> 24:51.610]  for Andrew to have
[24:51.610 --> 24:53.930]  these outs. It is
[24:53.930 --> 24:55.590]  all... It is all
[24:55.590 --> 24:57.990]  predicated on... Well, I didn't think
[24:57.990 --> 24:59.890]  that I wouldn't maybe think
[24:59.890 --> 25:01.790]  about trying to even do it once,
[25:01.910 --> 25:03.730]  maybe. Incredible. Also,
[25:03.850 --> 25:04.730]  something to consider
[25:06.030 --> 25:07.870]  is this is... You guys
[25:07.870 --> 25:09.750]  are filming this next week, and
[25:09.750 --> 25:11.850]  if you're uninformed in the audience of what we're
[25:11.850 --> 25:13.930]  talking about, Rooster Teeth makes a
[25:13.930 --> 25:15.850]  show in Minecraft
[25:15.850 --> 25:18.030]  that's essentially Survivor, the
[25:18.030 --> 25:19.030]  TV show Survivor, but
[25:20.190 --> 25:22.090]  performed in the video game Minecraft
[25:22.090 --> 25:24.070]  and shot like a reality
[25:24.070 --> 25:25.390]  TV show, exactly like
[25:27.390 --> 25:27.970]  Survivor is,
[25:28.030 --> 25:29.990]  and it's brilliant. But we're going to shoot
[25:29.990 --> 25:31.850]  it next week. It's not coming out until
[25:31.850 --> 25:33.250]  September or October or sometime.
[25:33.890 --> 25:36.010]  The hardest thing on Earth is going to
[25:36.010 --> 25:38.150]  be... You two are not going to be able to talk
[25:38.150 --> 25:39.890]  about what happens at all
[25:39.890 --> 25:42.050]  in any capacity. So if you have
[25:42.050 --> 25:44.110]  beefs, you're going to have to talk around
[25:44.110 --> 25:46.130]  them because you can
[25:46.130 --> 25:48.170]  not spoil the integrity of
[25:48.170 --> 25:50.230]  that show two or three months before it comes
[25:50.230 --> 25:52.090]  out. Seems like a problem for
[25:52.090 --> 25:54.250]  whoever edits this podcast. Yes, it does.
[25:57.430 --> 25:58.130]  Nick said
[25:58.130 --> 26:00.170]  uh-oh. Well, I mean, no
[26:00.170 --> 26:02.010]  spoilers. We're just talking about
[26:02.010 --> 26:03.470]  things, and I want to clarify
[26:04.310 --> 26:06.050]  genuinely, I'm going into this
[26:06.650 --> 26:08.070]  not expecting to even
[26:08.070 --> 26:10.330]  consider betraying you, Gavin, but who knows
[26:10.330 --> 26:12.170]  what'll happen. I understand if it goes the other way
[26:12.170 --> 26:14.070]  for you, too. It's a game
[26:14.070 --> 26:16.030]  where you have to kind of adjust. There's a lot of other
[26:16.030 --> 26:17.690]  people who'll be much better to betray.
[26:19.590 --> 26:19.990]  Yeah,
[26:20.250 --> 26:21.970]  for sure. Like, that's what I'm saying. I want to work
[26:21.970 --> 26:23.950]  with you. In my ideal world, we're
[26:23.950 --> 26:25.970]  working together until
[26:25.970 --> 26:27.950]  a point in which one of us probably
[26:27.950 --> 26:30.310]  will end up betraying the other. But I would...
[26:30.310 --> 26:32.050]  I wouldn't be opposed to
[26:32.050 --> 26:33.030]  working with you the entire way.
[26:34.570 --> 26:35.470]  That's nice to hear.
[26:35.850 --> 26:37.950]  Yeah, and I don't... your tone...
[26:37.950 --> 26:38.990]  I don't feel like you believe me.
[26:39.990 --> 26:41.570]  Well, I've got to be wary of it.
[26:41.570 --> 26:43.630]  Gavin, you are so
[26:43.630 --> 26:45.430]  fucked. He is gunning for you.
[26:45.490 --> 26:46.910]  No! No! No!
[26:47.530 --> 26:48.730]  The opposite of that!
[26:49.690 --> 26:51.610]  There are other people... I won't
[26:51.610 --> 26:53.630]  say. There are other people I'm much more worried about than
[26:53.630 --> 26:55.490]  Gavin. I don't mean that disrespectfully, but
[26:55.490 --> 26:57.850]  you know. Let's take a...
[26:57.850 --> 26:59.530]  let's take a poll of
[26:59.530 --> 27:01.510]  people who are not going to be in Survive
[27:01.510 --> 27:03.570]  Block Island, but that are present here on this podcast.
[27:04.090 --> 27:05.030]  That'll be Geoff,
[27:05.470 --> 27:07.590]  Nick, and Eric. Eric, is
[27:08.050 --> 27:09.290]  Andrew going to fuck Gavin over?
[27:09.290 --> 27:11.550]  Uh, yes. I think... I think, again,
[27:11.630 --> 27:12.770]  the way he just
[27:13.290 --> 27:15.270]  gave himself a million outs when he
[27:15.270 --> 27:17.550]  was saying he wouldn't do it is so
[27:18.290 --> 27:19.170]  just exactly
[27:19.170 --> 27:21.330]  on the nose for what you know is going to
[27:21.330 --> 27:22.410]  happen. So, yes. Yeah, no.
[27:22.850 --> 27:25.050]  Yeah, Nick says you're already doomed
[27:25.050 --> 27:27.190]  100% he will fuck Gavin
[27:27.190 --> 27:28.310]  over. That's my problem.
[27:29.110 --> 27:31.370]  I feel like Nick said it better than I could.
[27:31.970 --> 27:32.630]  Uh, yeah.
[27:32.990 --> 27:34.890]  But that's why I think Gavin's going to betray me.
[27:34.990 --> 27:37.210]  Because I don't feel that way. Which is why you're
[27:37.210 --> 27:39.010]  going to betray him first. Mmm.
[27:39.650 --> 27:41.130]  That's typically not how this goes.
[27:41.450 --> 27:43.070]  Your doubt is going to drive the knife
[27:43.070 --> 27:44.850]  straight into my spine. No.
[27:45.250 --> 27:46.970]  And your paranoia. You get pretty paranoid.
[27:48.570 --> 27:49.170]  Who does?
[27:50.270 --> 27:50.830]  You do.
[27:51.270 --> 27:53.050]  I do? You think I get paranoid? Definitely.
[27:53.190 --> 27:55.050]  Every time you see him having a conversation with someone else. You were going to fucking light
[27:55.050 --> 27:57.210]  every bat on fire in your house when there was
[27:57.210 --> 27:59.270]  a shipping error. What do you mean I get paranoid?
[27:59.570 --> 28:01.150]  It's not an either or. We can
[28:01.150 --> 28:03.530]  both be very paranoid. I'm 100%
[28:03.530 --> 28:04.970]  paranoid. I understand
[28:04.970 --> 28:06.910]  paranoia. That's how I know you're paranoid.
[28:07.310 --> 28:09.110]  That's fair. And based off of my
[28:09.110 --> 28:10.950]  assessment of your paranoia, I will take your
[28:10.950 --> 28:11.610]  grade.
[28:12.850 --> 28:14.150]  You seem like a specialist.
[28:14.730 --> 28:16.650]  I will accept your diagnosis of paranoia.
[28:16.890 --> 28:19.030]  It's a very paranoid game. But I trust
[28:19.030 --> 28:21.030]  you. I don't, and I don't mean this
[28:21.030 --> 28:23.010]  rudely, Gavin. I don't think you're going to play a
[28:23.010 --> 28:24.910]  sneaky game. Because I just don't think that that's really
[28:24.910 --> 28:26.730]  who you are as a person. Alright.
[28:26.890 --> 28:28.890]  That's why I want to work with you. But the response
[28:28.890 --> 28:30.870]  is very, it's a very keep your
[28:30.870 --> 28:32.930]  cards to your chest response. I don't know how to
[28:32.930 --> 28:34.430]  read that. I'm glad you feel that way.
[28:34.670 --> 28:36.930]  Now that, can we get some discussion about
[28:36.930 --> 28:37.730]  that phrasing?
[28:39.530 --> 28:40.410]  That's, that's
[28:41.050 --> 28:42.890]  Gavin's, the hairs on the back
[28:42.890 --> 28:44.930]  of Gavin's neck are standing straight up right now. I think
[28:44.930 --> 28:46.370]  he's already in self-defense mode.
[28:46.690 --> 28:48.710]  I don't think. That's going to be fun.
[28:48.930 --> 28:50.990]  I'm excited for that to happen.
[28:51.830 --> 28:52.950]  And it will be weird
[28:52.950 --> 28:54.730]  to not be able to talk about it
[28:54.730 --> 28:55.570]  for like two months.
[28:58.510 --> 28:59.150]  I feel
[28:59.150 --> 29:00.890]  bad because I keep texting Geoff about it.
[29:00.890 --> 29:02.510]  I keep, I have all these questions.
[29:02.750 --> 29:04.750]  I feel like I'm annoying. Andrew, it's not
[29:04.750 --> 29:06.290]  annoying me at all. I love it, but
[29:06.930 --> 29:08.310]  Andrew does put me to work.
[29:08.690 --> 29:10.710]  He'll be like, hey, what if
[29:10.710 --> 29:12.810]  this impossible set of
[29:13.690 --> 29:14.850]  sequence of events happened?
[29:15.090 --> 29:16.830]  Would I get in trouble? And I have to go
[29:16.830 --> 29:18.930]  like, well, I have to go research that now
[29:18.930 --> 29:20.530]  and have to go fucking look it up.
[29:20.770 --> 29:22.610]  Is he already sticking outside the game?
[29:22.890 --> 29:24.950]  Oh yeah, come on. Every question
[29:24.950 --> 29:26.730]  is like, yeah, for sure.
[29:26.970 --> 29:28.810]  It was very funny. I'm like, I'm not trying to
[29:28.810 --> 29:30.710]  break the rules, but I would like to twist them into
[29:30.710 --> 29:31.270]  a pretzel.
[29:33.190 --> 29:33.550]  The
[29:34.590 --> 29:36.730]  very first text I sent, I was like,
[29:36.810 --> 29:38.710]  I said to Geoff, I have questions
[29:38.710 --> 29:41.090]  about certain things. Who would I ask
[29:41.090 --> 29:42.690]  if I have a rules question?
[29:42.810 --> 29:44.470]  Geoff was kind enough to be like, ah, you know,
[29:44.510 --> 29:46.770]  I was involved. Feel free to ask me and I can
[29:46.770 --> 29:48.730]  answer. You answered it in a way that was very
[29:48.730 --> 29:50.950]  clearly like you expecting
[29:50.950 --> 29:52.690]  to be able to answer something kind of basic
[29:52.690 --> 29:54.590]  and I asked you an extremely
[29:54.590 --> 29:56.350]  specific situation thing.
[29:56.350 --> 29:58.170]  And your response is just, fuck,
[29:58.350 --> 30:00.410]  I'll get back to you. Like you then had to ask
[30:00.410 --> 30:02.370]  somebody. Yeah, well then I had to go
[30:02.370 --> 30:04.310]  I had to go have a meeting about that
[30:04.310 --> 30:04.750]  question.
[30:06.470 --> 30:08.550]  With two other people so we could determine
[30:08.550 --> 30:09.170]  the answer.
[30:15.340 --> 30:16.180]  Now a word from
[30:16.180 --> 30:18.060]  our sponsor, BetterHelp. Being
[30:18.060 --> 30:20.120]  able to take care of your mental health is so
[30:20.120 --> 30:22.140]  important. There's all sorts of things you can do.
[30:22.240 --> 30:24.420]  It really is dependent on you. I personally
[30:24.420 --> 30:25.700]  love to listen to music.
[30:26.060 --> 30:27.700]  When I'm sorting through things, it kind of
[30:27.700 --> 30:29.680]  gives me a little bit
[30:29.680 --> 30:31.500]  of a disconnect from what I'm going through
[30:31.500 --> 30:33.620]  while also making me very present.
[30:34.060 --> 30:35.700]  It's just a fantastic tool.
[30:36.200 --> 30:37.760]  Therapy is something that has been very helpful
[30:37.760 --> 30:39.700]  for me. There's all sorts of things
[30:39.700 --> 30:41.720]  you can do. It's just really coming
[30:41.720 --> 30:43.380]  up with those systems that work for
[30:43.380 --> 30:45.680]  what you're going through and what's best
[30:45.680 --> 30:47.700]  for you. Therapy is something that I've talked
[30:47.700 --> 30:49.480]  so much about as having a tremendous
[30:49.480 --> 30:51.820]  impact on my life. Talking to someone
[30:51.820 --> 30:53.420]  and sorting through things, it just
[30:53.980 --> 30:55.380]  it has illuminated
[30:55.380 --> 30:57.410]  issues I had and helped inform
[30:58.260 --> 30:59.420]  why I was struggling
[30:59.420 --> 31:01.580]  in certain ways that I didn't
[31:01.580 --> 31:03.560]  realize. If you're somebody who
[31:03.560 --> 31:05.380]  is maybe going through something,
[31:05.500 --> 31:07.680]  I would always recommend at least trying therapy.
[31:08.220 --> 31:09.380]  BetterHelp is an online
[31:09.380 --> 31:11.480]  therapy that offers video phone and even
[31:11.480 --> 31:13.480]  live chat only therapy sessions
[31:13.480 --> 31:15.400]  so you don't have to see anyone on camera
[31:15.400 --> 31:17.580]  if you don't want to. It's much more affordable
[31:17.580 --> 31:19.460]  than in-person therapy and you can be matched with
[31:19.460 --> 31:21.680]  a therapist in under 48 hours.

[31:27.520 --> 31:29.520]  That's BetterHelp.com
[31:30.860 --> 31:31.820]  slash face
[31:32.640 --> 31:33.800]  Whether you're a past
[31:33.800 --> 31:35.600]  smoker who knows what sucked about the
[31:35.600 --> 31:37.440]  process of quitting or a current smoker
[31:37.440 --> 31:39.640]  who's currently struggling through that process,
[31:39.960 --> 31:41.600]  I have a thing you have to check out. It's called
[31:41.600 --> 31:43.520]  Fume. Fume is the natural
[31:43.520 --> 31:45.500]  inhaler designed for a better, safer
[31:45.500 --> 31:47.080]  and natural way to quit cigarettes.
[31:47.320 --> 31:49.760]  It's a no smoke, no vape, and no nicotine
[31:49.760 --> 31:51.520]  replacement for the hand-to-mouth
[31:51.520 --> 31:53.500]  habit of smoking. Fume
[31:53.500 --> 31:55.720]  handcrafts wooden inhalers and uses
[31:55.720 --> 31:57.400]  cores infused with plant oils
[31:57.400 --> 31:59.360]  studied to curb cravings.
[31:59.720 --> 32:01.600]  They have flavors like Peppermint and Conquer
[32:01.600 --> 32:03.500]  with minty notes to simulate menthol
[32:03.500 --> 32:05.560]  cigarettes, and other flavors like
[32:05.560 --> 32:07.780]  Cozy Chai and Lemonberry Bliss
[32:07.780 --> 32:09.180]  for a sweeter experience.
[32:09.620 --> 32:11.840]  And all of their flavors are 100%
[32:11.840 --> 32:13.680]  natural. No harmful chemicals,
[32:14.020 --> 32:15.060]  no artificial flavors,
[32:15.480 --> 32:17.320]  and absolutely no nicotine.
[32:17.840 --> 32:19.620]  Quitting is tough, but Fume really can
[32:19.620 --> 32:21.500]  help. They've got thousands of
[32:21.500 --> 32:23.400]  5-star reviews from smokers who have tried
[32:23.400 --> 32:25.060]  everything else, and this worked.
[32:25.560 --> 32:27.500]  Also, if you're somebody who flies all the time,
[32:27.580 --> 32:29.100]  being able to use Fume in the airport
[32:29.540 --> 32:31.700]  and in the air makes a huge
[32:31.700 --> 32:33.480]  difference. Whether you're a
[32:33.480 --> 32:35.660]  smoker or an ex-smoker who still
[32:35.660 --> 32:37.500]  struggles with cravings, Fume is
[32:37.500 --> 32:39.600]  the perfect tool for you. So head

[32:58.840 --> 32:59.800]  Oh, did you
[32:59.800 --> 33:01.720]  did you guys see, um
[33:01.720 --> 33:03.420]  I'll put this in the slides, the screen
[33:03.420 --> 33:05.480]  matched baseball? I did, that's
[33:05.480 --> 33:07.440]  so cool. How cool is that? That was wild.
[33:07.620 --> 33:09.120]  Wild. That's incredible.
[33:09.440 --> 33:11.400]  Someone has taken from the big
[33:11.400 --> 33:13.440]  baseball video, the one that
[33:13.440 --> 33:15.320]  I was intending to post on the YouTube channel
[33:15.320 --> 33:16.640]  before the other two got posted,
[33:18.220 --> 33:19.480]  but someone found
[33:19.480 --> 33:21.280]  I think the very first ball that
[33:21.280 --> 33:23.240]  Geoff signed, and they have it, and they've
[33:23.240 --> 33:24.720]  held their ball up to the screen
[33:25.320 --> 33:26.840]  and it's the exact same mark.
[33:27.580 --> 33:28.940]  Giant monster hands.
[33:29.320 --> 33:31.160]  Yeah, we sold that one to a giant apparently,
[33:31.480 --> 33:33.180]  but uh, yeah, that is the ball.
[33:34.220 --> 33:34.980]  Yeah, that's pretty wild.
[33:36.540 --> 33:37.240]  Do we have any...
[33:37.240 --> 33:39.000]  The baseball looks like a small plum.
[33:39.800 --> 33:41.260]  It does. It looks
[33:41.260 --> 33:43.180]  very tidy. Do we have any other videos
[33:43.180 --> 33:44.400]  that were meant to come out?
[33:44.540 --> 33:47.300]  I guess the auction video comes out tomorrow.
[33:47.920 --> 33:48.580]  Yeah, I think so.
[33:48.800 --> 33:50.900]  It'll be out by the time people hear this, but tomorrow
[33:50.900 --> 33:52.200]  for us when we're currently recording.
[33:52.920 --> 33:54.580]  And then of course MVP2 at some point.
[33:54.800 --> 33:56.240]  And then MVP2 at some point.
[33:56.820 --> 33:58.800]  You want to spend the next half hour trying to schedule it?
[33:58.860 --> 34:01.100]  I got time now. Now it's not the last four minutes
[34:01.100 --> 34:02.920]  of a fucking podcast. Yeah, we got nothing but time.
[34:03.240 --> 34:04.800]  I would, Eric, but I wanted to
[34:05.140 --> 34:06.780]  give you guys an update on my corn dogs.
[34:07.240 --> 34:09.260]  Update? I still haven't had a corn dog.
[34:09.940 --> 34:10.740]  What? That's it.
[34:11.160 --> 34:12.880]  Yeah, I remember I swore off corn dogs forever.
[34:13.260 --> 34:14.900]  Every once in a while I give you guys an update.
[34:16.000 --> 34:16.640]  And, uh...
[34:16.640 --> 34:18.840]  They're still sworn off. Yeah, I still haven't had one.
[34:19.660 --> 34:20.480]  You still... wait.
[34:23.160 --> 34:23.480]  So...
[34:23.480 --> 34:24.400]  You swore off...
[34:24.400 --> 34:26.800]  Yeah, I've said this multiple... we've had this conversation multiple times.
[34:26.860 --> 34:29.020]  I said I would never eat a corn dog again as long as I live.
[34:29.080 --> 34:31.020]  Thank you, Gavin. And you still haven't had one?
[34:31.100 --> 34:32.480]  That's your update? Still haven't had one. Just the update.
[34:32.520 --> 34:34.500]  Just giving you the update. Okay, was there a
[34:34.940 --> 34:36.440]  moment in which you almost did?
[34:36.920 --> 34:38.840]  No. No, not really. But I just
[34:38.840 --> 34:40.540]  realized I hadn't checked in with you guys in a while
[34:40.540 --> 34:41.740]  and I just didn't want to leave you hanging.
[34:42.300 --> 34:44.700]  Emily did buy some frozen corn dogs the other day
[34:44.700 --> 34:46.680]  but I was not in any way tempted by them.
[34:47.000 --> 34:48.840]  Did she have some? Yeah, she had some.
[34:49.060 --> 34:50.840]  I think. No. They just threw them away.
[34:51.880 --> 34:52.800]  That's a strange buy.
[34:53.060 --> 34:54.820]  If they're in the freezer, it doesn't mean they've had them yet.
[34:55.060 --> 34:56.840]  That's true. But, like, are you
[34:56.840 --> 34:59.160]  really buying corn dogs for a later day?
[34:59.880 --> 35:00.960]  Do you eat stuff
[35:00.960 --> 35:02.980]  like, that you freeze the same week?
[35:03.140 --> 35:05.520]  I feel like the freezer is a long-term meal.
[35:05.820 --> 35:06.980]  No, if I'm buying something
[35:06.980 --> 35:08.880]  from the freezer section, that doesn't mean I'm gonna
[35:08.880 --> 35:10.500]  wait for it. It's just how it's delivered.
[35:10.980 --> 35:12.860]  I got a Red Baron in mind that's probably been in there
[35:12.860 --> 35:14.700]  six weeks. That's crazy.
[35:14.840 --> 35:16.860]  I bought two frozen pizzas.
[35:17.140 --> 35:18.940]  They will be done... I will eat them
[35:18.940 --> 35:20.460]  within the week. Easily. Huh.
[35:21.020 --> 35:23.160]  That's sort of like wasting the freezer, though.
[35:23.680 --> 35:25.180]  What do you mean? I gotta go with Gavin on this one.
[35:25.600 --> 35:26.880]  The whole point of the freezer
[35:26.880 --> 35:28.200]  is to...
[35:28.200 --> 35:30.840]  It's to preserve. But I'm buying
[35:30.840 --> 35:33.080]  food that is frozen to reheat to eat
[35:33.080 --> 35:34.980]  now. I'm not...
[35:34.980 --> 35:36.540]  I don't go into the...
[35:37.100 --> 35:38.900]  I mean, if you're gonna eat it now, why
[35:38.900 --> 35:41.180]  buy it frozen? It's always now
[35:41.180 --> 35:43.020]  when you eat it. That's always
[35:43.020 --> 35:44.480]  the case. You always eat it in the present.
[35:45.200 --> 35:47.000]  Listen, stupid. Let me
[35:47.000 --> 35:48.800]  rephrase this, because I said it horribly.
[35:48.900 --> 35:50.860]  I said it in a dumb way. If I'm in the
[35:50.860 --> 35:53.100]  freezer section in a grocery store,
[35:53.240 --> 35:54.860]  I'm not looking in the pizza aisle
[35:54.860 --> 35:57.020]  going, I'm gonna fucking enjoy this
[35:57.020 --> 35:58.620]  in June. Or December.
[35:59.300 --> 36:00.960]  Like, I'm not gonna... What do you mean? I buy
[36:00.960 --> 36:02.900]  it because I plan on eating it because I feel like
[36:02.900 --> 36:04.860]  it's like a pizza, and I'll have it within the week
[36:04.860 --> 36:06.900]  typically. You're definitely gonna betray me now.
[36:07.120 --> 36:08.800]  Why would you buy a frozen one?
[36:08.960 --> 36:10.580]  You could go buy like a...
[36:10.580 --> 36:11.220]  Yeah, you could buy fresh.
[36:11.580 --> 36:14.720]  Because it's the fresh one, it's like a grocery
[36:14.720 --> 36:16.240]  store pizza, and they're cheaper.
[36:17.480 --> 36:18.920]  I use the flyer to buy
[36:18.920 --> 36:21.040]  my groceries typically. They were on sale
[36:21.040 --> 36:22.940]  $2 a pizza. I bought two of them.
[36:23.420 --> 36:24.860]  So I'll have the two frozen pizzas
[36:24.860 --> 36:25.620]  for meals this week.
[36:26.380 --> 36:28.220]  Maybe it's just different how we buy groceries.
[36:28.500 --> 36:30.680]  I typically will look at the flyer. What a fucking
[36:30.680 --> 36:32.840]  fascinating podcast topic. I look
[36:32.840 --> 36:34.600]  at the flyer once a week and I buy off the flyer
[36:34.600 --> 36:36.760]  for how I get groceries. What flyer?
[36:37.020 --> 36:38.680]  From the grocery store. I'll go on their
[36:38.680 --> 36:40.740]  website and be like, oh, what's the weekly flyer?
[36:40.820 --> 36:42.580]  Then I will buy off of the flyer to get
[36:42.580 --> 36:44.460]  discounted. Do they have a flyer that just
[36:44.460 --> 36:46.700]  tells you what's on the end caps? They don't.
[36:46.880 --> 36:48.420]  Tragically. I'd love that.
[36:48.480 --> 36:50.720]  It'd be a great savings. Maybe you should
[36:50.720 --> 36:52.120]  start an independent newsletter
[36:52.520 --> 36:54.580]  that you can distribute around your town that just
[36:54.580 --> 36:56.460]  explains what the deals on end caps are
[36:56.460 --> 36:57.080]  week to week.
[36:58.460 --> 36:59.400]  Like a scouting
[36:59.400 --> 37:01.100]  report? Yeah, kind of.
[37:01.320 --> 37:03.280]  As the guy who invented
[37:03.280 --> 37:05.140]  Thank Me Later, I'm surprised
[37:05.140 --> 37:06.380]  that that's how you use your freezer.
[37:06.680 --> 37:09.080]  The freezer is the ultimate Thank Me Later
[37:09.080 --> 37:10.860]  for food. No, there are
[37:10.860 --> 37:12.720]  things for sure
[37:12.720 --> 37:14.880]  that are just there
[37:14.880 --> 37:17.240]  and they exist for a very long time, and that's fine.
[37:17.640 --> 37:19.020]  So what's long term in your freezer?
[37:20.260 --> 37:21.180]  What's long term?
[37:21.320 --> 37:22.900]  I don't... probably like
[37:22.900 --> 37:25.140]  frozen fruit. So how did it end
[37:25.140 --> 37:27.100]  up there? Did you intend to eat it within
[37:27.100 --> 37:28.560]  a few days and then you just forgot?
[37:28.860 --> 37:30.820]  Or did you buy it for later consumption?
[37:31.540 --> 37:33.180]  It's always like I either forgot
[37:33.180 --> 37:35.080]  or I just haven't gotten around to it. So like
[37:35.080 --> 37:37.180]  something that would last a long time or like if I buy
[37:37.180 --> 37:39.160]  a box of Eggo waffles or something like
[37:39.160 --> 37:41.180]  that. That will last a while. I'm not going to
[37:41.180 --> 37:42.440]  go through that whole box in a week.
[37:43.280 --> 37:45.160]  But things that are like singular meal
[37:45.160 --> 37:46.820]  items like a pizza, those aren't
[37:46.820 --> 37:47.760]  lasting long.
[37:49.220 --> 37:50.960]  Yeah, I guess we just shop differently.
[37:51.160 --> 37:52.460]  I buy frozen food and I like
[37:52.460 --> 37:54.480]  like I'm probably in like a week or
[37:54.480 --> 37:56.480]  two weeks or three weeks. I'm going to be fucking exhausted
[37:56.480 --> 37:58.240]  and not feel like cooking or ordering or
[37:58.240 --> 37:59.620]  I'll just pop this in.
[38:00.200 --> 38:02.580]  Mine's for when like in the future
[38:02.580 --> 38:04.560]  on an unknown date. I'm either going to get back
[38:04.560 --> 38:06.460]  pretty late, not have enough time to make
[38:06.460 --> 38:08.560]  anything or order something. And it's just like an emergency
[38:08.560 --> 38:10.540]  meal for me. That makes sense.
[38:11.220 --> 38:12.420]  That's a valid way to have it.
[38:12.800 --> 38:13.560]  And ice cream.
[38:14.400 --> 38:16.320]  You got any ice cream in your freezer right now?
[38:16.660 --> 38:18.060]  Yeah, got some dark...
[38:19.200 --> 38:20.560]  What's your favorite flavor
[38:20.560 --> 38:21.100]  of ice cream?
[38:22.240 --> 38:24.500]  Why was the ice cream part, Gavin, that
[38:24.500 --> 38:26.460]  broke you on this? Well, I don't know. I was just
[38:26.460 --> 38:28.520]  fascinated with how you used your freezer, but now we're just talking
[38:28.520 --> 38:29.460]  about what's in our freezers.
[38:34.720 --> 38:36.480]  I was curious what ice cream you had.
[38:37.300 --> 38:38.940]  I like the ones...
[38:38.940 --> 38:40.520]  Yeah, cookie dough's pretty good with chocolate
[38:40.520 --> 38:41.980]  chips. Cookie dough is good.
[38:42.400 --> 38:44.420]  It's all about texture for me. Do you have a brand
[38:44.420 --> 38:46.860]  choice? Probably Ben and Jerry's.
[38:46.880 --> 38:47.980]  Ben and Jerry's. Okay.
[38:47.980 --> 38:49.940]  How about you? I like Ben and Jerry's.
[38:50.100 --> 38:52.060]  Ben and Jerry's is good. I don't really have a brand
[38:52.060 --> 38:54.140]  preference, as far as ice cream goes.
[38:54.560 --> 38:56.040]  I will devour ice cream in a fucking
[38:56.040 --> 38:58.100]  day. Ice cream is not lasting long.
[38:59.140 --> 39:00.000]  Ice cream is not a
[39:00.000 --> 39:01.940]  long-term item in my freezer. Really?
[39:02.040 --> 39:04.140]  I cannot eat a lot at once.
[39:04.780 --> 39:05.960]  I eat like an inch of
[39:05.960 --> 39:07.820]  ice cream at a time. Cookie two-step.
[39:08.140 --> 39:10.140]  That's the shit right there. That's your favorite
[39:10.140 --> 39:11.860]  ice cream? Bluebell cookie two-step.
[39:12.160 --> 39:13.580]  Yeah, when it's not full of
[39:14.020 --> 39:15.400]  listeria. They survive.
[39:15.400 --> 39:17.500]  I think the
[39:17.500 --> 39:19.560]  cookie two-step was a thing I learned
[39:19.560 --> 39:21.220]  at the same place I learned the sewing machine.
[39:21.280 --> 39:23.360]  I think we would do that after we'd start
[39:23.360 --> 39:24.860]  with the sewing machine. The icky cookie two-step.
[39:25.200 --> 39:27.620]  We would do the icky cookie two-step.
[39:29.900 --> 39:31.220]  Still a half-gallon,
[39:31.320 --> 39:33.320]  it says on the front. I like that a lot. The
[39:33.320 --> 39:35.300]  implication of, did you hear? I hear they may have
[39:35.300 --> 39:37.280]  gone below the half-gallon like they used
[39:37.280 --> 39:39.440]  to, but no. Let us clear the air.
[39:39.820 --> 39:41.120]  Still a half-gallon.
[39:41.180 --> 39:43.320]  Or like all the other brands did and they just refused.
[39:47.140 --> 39:48.020]  I was like,
[39:48.060 --> 39:49.440]  cause you see that with fast food ads
[39:49.440 --> 39:51.300]  all the time, like Wendy's whole thing
[39:51.300 --> 39:53.320]  is never frozen beef, right?
[39:53.400 --> 39:55.420]  Like what, are other companies doing
[39:55.420 --> 39:57.740]  that? How many other companies? Like it feels like a weird
[39:58.340 --> 39:59.520]  just declaring you're
[39:59.520 --> 40:00.660]  doing a thing
[40:01.100 --> 40:03.260]  that doesn't necessarily, I guess the assumption
[40:03.260 --> 40:05.460]  is all the other companies do. I know that
[40:05.460 --> 40:07.340]  Monster Munch have, I think
[40:07.340 --> 40:09.700]  on their packets have like old
[40:10.900 --> 40:11.340]  bit
[40:12.000 --> 40:13.520]  new old size?
[40:13.520 --> 40:15.460]  What was it? New old
[40:15.460 --> 40:17.560]  size? Oh, I
[40:17.560 --> 40:19.540]  remember this. Cause they
[40:19.540 --> 40:21.560]  made them smaller, right? They made them smaller then made
[40:21.560 --> 40:23.500]  them big again. I can't remember how they froze it.
[40:23.900 --> 40:25.180]  For what? What was the product?
[40:25.620 --> 40:26.820]  Monster Munch. The crisps.
[40:27.320 --> 40:29.580]  Okay, I didn't know what they were though. Like I knew
[40:29.580 --> 40:31.460]  the name of, I've never heard of a Monster Munch.
[40:31.920 --> 40:33.640]  I'm gonna do some Googling. There you go.
[40:33.800 --> 40:34.940]  Oh, I have seen those!
[40:35.780 --> 40:37.500]  Pickled onion flavor. Yeah, there's pickled onion,
[40:37.640 --> 40:39.300]  there's roast beef, and then there's flaming hot.
[40:40.040 --> 40:41.580]  There should be a company that
[40:41.580 --> 40:43.460]  does what DVD companies do
[40:43.460 --> 40:45.040]  with things on the bag.
[40:45.480 --> 40:47.780]  I will only eat chips that are entertaining
[40:47.780 --> 40:49.500]  and fun. It's my only, it's my
[40:49.500 --> 40:50.640]  guideline for any snack.
[40:54.480 --> 40:55.420]  Interactive menus.
[40:55.660 --> 40:57.640]  Didn't we talk about Monster Munch recently on this
[40:57.640 --> 40:59.500]  podcast? No! I
[40:59.500 --> 41:01.600]  think, so yeah, we talked
[41:01.600 --> 41:03.480]  about Monster Munch at large
[41:03.480 --> 41:05.680]  recently, and I think it was maybe
[41:05.680 --> 41:07.120]  when we were hanging out outside of work.
[41:07.800 --> 41:08.840]  Yeah, so it says new
[41:09.520 --> 41:10.560]  crossed out old,
[41:10.680 --> 41:12.700]  and then it says bigger like they used to be.
[41:13.060 --> 41:14.860]  What? On the top
[41:14.860 --> 41:16.060]  corner of that picture. Top corner.
[41:16.860 --> 41:19.040]  New, oh, slash old.
[41:19.860 --> 41:20.840]  So they made them
[41:20.840 --> 41:22.740]  smaller and then everyone was like, we hate it.
[41:23.560 --> 41:24.660]  So they made them bigger again.
[41:25.120 --> 41:26.620]  Oh, so that was their, I get
[41:26.620 --> 41:28.880]  what you're saying. The campaign was, we did it.
[41:29.000 --> 41:30.520]  We got rid of the new.
[41:31.060 --> 41:32.580]  And that's the multi-bag.
[41:33.080 --> 41:34.880]  Yeah, we were gonna do a gauntlet of crisps, I think,
[41:34.960 --> 41:37.000]  weren't we? Yeah, we were gonna do some sort of a taste test or something.
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.360]  Does that not ring a bell, Andrew?
[41:40.040 --> 41:41.180]  Not at all, to me.
[41:41.540 --> 41:42.860]  I think we were talking about it with Emily.
[41:43.340 --> 41:45.020]  With our significant others,
[41:45.100 --> 41:46.700]  maybe. Maybe this was at, I don't know.
[41:47.000 --> 41:48.920]  Oh, maybe it was when we were having lunch after
[41:48.920 --> 41:51.000]  jet skiing. That would make sense. Maybe you're having
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.080]  some chips, doing a ranking of them.
[41:53.460 --> 41:55.000]  It might have been. Yeah, and then I was
[41:55.000 --> 41:56.760]  gonna send you both, you and Andrew,
[41:56.980 --> 41:59.240]  all of the crisps, and you were gonna do the crisp gauntlet.
[41:59.700 --> 42:00.860]  Oh, I'd love to do that.
[42:01.300 --> 42:02.960]  Yeah. And then we were gonna determine
[42:02.960 --> 42:04.640]  once and for all what the best flavors were.
[42:04.640 --> 42:06.100]  Roast beef, flamin' hot,
[42:06.120 --> 42:07.800]  I feel like roast beef, probably
[42:08.840 --> 42:10.580]  the best one of those ones.
[42:10.700 --> 42:12.000]  I think pickled onion's the best.
[42:12.300 --> 42:14.680]  I think, I gotta say, man, I think the
[42:15.760 --> 42:16.720]  munch sounds
[42:16.720 --> 42:18.720]  disgusting. Like, every flavor
[42:18.720 --> 42:20.520]  sounds like a flavor I wouldn't want.
[42:20.980 --> 42:22.700]  But the packaging is adorable.
[42:24.200 --> 42:26.680]  You like the little monsters? I love the monsters.
[42:26.800 --> 42:28.880]  I love the purple color and the green monster.
[42:28.980 --> 42:30.040]  I like the font.
[42:30.280 --> 42:31.200]  It all looks great.
[42:31.200 --> 42:32.900]  I just, it loses me at
[42:32.900 --> 42:34.220]  roast beef and pickled onion.
[42:34.580 --> 42:36.340]  Why aren't onions called pickles?
[42:38.380 --> 42:38.660]  Huh?
[42:39.200 --> 42:39.740]  They're pickled.
[42:40.380 --> 42:42.720]  Yeah, but, so pickles
[42:42.720 --> 42:43.600]  are cucumbers.
[42:44.240 --> 42:45.440]  Yeah, well,
[42:46.420 --> 42:47.820]  they're pickled cucumbers.
[42:48.300 --> 42:49.500]  In America, they are.
[42:50.240 --> 42:51.960]  They're called other stuff other places.
[42:52.160 --> 42:53.960]  You call them gherkins, right, Kevin?
[42:54.360 --> 42:56.640]  Yeah. Okay. But in America,
[42:56.920 --> 42:59.200]  so a pickled, so you have a cucumber
[42:59.200 --> 43:01.320]  and you pickle it, and now it's just a pickle.
[43:01.540 --> 43:03.260]  But you can pickle all sorts of
[43:03.260 --> 43:04.300]  things. You can pickle onions.
[43:05.060 --> 43:06.760]  Yeah, I mean, Branston Pickle is a bunch of
[43:06.760 --> 43:09.140]  pickle stuff. What would you choose out of these
[43:09.140 --> 43:11.140]  three flavors of knick-knacks, Andrew?
[43:11.340 --> 43:12.640]  What the fuck is a knick-knack?
[43:12.640 --> 43:14.940]  You got nice and spicy, you got scampi and lemon,
[43:15.060 --> 43:16.440]  or rib and saucy.
[43:16.460 --> 43:18.680]  Oh, I like my knick-knacks scampi.
[43:20.980 --> 43:21.420]  You...
[43:21.960 --> 43:22.400]  Ew.
[43:22.840 --> 43:24.440]  What are these? Are these chips?
[43:25.440 --> 43:26.180]  They're knick-knacks.
[43:26.180 --> 43:27.220]  They're knick-knacks.
[43:28.320 --> 43:30.420]  We gotta... this is a thing we need to
[43:30.420 --> 43:32.240]  pursue. We haven't done a food thing in a while
[43:32.240 --> 43:34.140]  on this show. I'd love to do a deep dive on chips.
[43:34.560 --> 43:35.520]  US has the worst.
[43:36.140 --> 43:37.780]  They stink. Your flavors are terrible.
[43:38.120 --> 43:40.340]  No variety. What the fuck are you
[43:40.340 --> 43:40.980]  talking about?
[43:41.700 --> 43:44.240]  You have such bland, limited flavors
[43:44.240 --> 43:44.780]  in America.
[43:45.900 --> 43:47.940]  I'm sorry we don't have shrimp
[43:47.940 --> 43:50.240]  scampi potato chips, but it's because
[43:50.240 --> 43:52.380]  we have some kind of fucking standards.
[43:53.020 --> 43:54.120]  Jesus fucking Christ.
[43:54.120 --> 43:56.360]  We don't have roast beef flavored potato
[43:56.360 --> 43:58.020]  chips because we make roast beef here.
[43:58.400 --> 43:59.700]  I mean...
[43:59.700 --> 44:01.500]  We don't need to make pickle...
[44:01.500 --> 44:04.180]  We got real flavors for real people that eat real
[44:04.180 --> 44:06.220]  food. Yeah, but you have salt and vinegar.
[44:06.880 --> 44:07.880]  I don't eat that shit.
[44:09.000 --> 44:09.940]  Okay, fair enough.
[44:11.900 --> 44:14.080]  Whenever I'm in the US and I look at the chip pile,
[44:14.140 --> 44:14.980]  it's always disappointing.
[44:15.580 --> 44:17.960]  Typically, the US has
[44:17.960 --> 44:20.060]  more of everything, but the chip...
[44:20.060 --> 44:21.780]  You guys are really lacking in the chip department.
[44:21.780 --> 44:22.960]  What about Twiglets?
[44:23.460 --> 44:24.480]  That's a great name.
[44:25.140 --> 44:27.960]  That is a great name. I've never heard of a Twiglet.
[44:28.780 --> 44:30.120]  Dude, you gotta love Twiglets.
[44:30.540 --> 44:31.660]  What else does Jacob make
[44:31.660 --> 44:33.300]  other than Twiglets? Crackers?
[44:35.320 --> 44:37.000]  I don't know what a cracker is in your country.
[44:38.700 --> 44:40.740]  Is it like a pair of boots?
[44:43.500 --> 44:44.800]  This is fucking stupid.
[44:45.180 --> 44:47.380]  It is a dumb conversation, but I'm genuinely...
[44:47.380 --> 44:48.740]  We need to do the chip thing.
[44:48.740 --> 44:50.600]  I'm gonna get you both packages.
[44:50.740 --> 44:53.120]  How many bags of different flavors do you think we should do?
[44:53.700 --> 44:54.360]  Eight? All of them.
[44:55.040 --> 44:56.400]  I should just try all the flavors, right?
[44:56.760 --> 44:57.320]  All of them?
[44:57.900 --> 44:59.600]  I don't know how to answer that question.
[45:00.160 --> 45:02.760]  I feel like we should throw American chips in the way, too.
[45:03.220 --> 45:04.200]  Oh, what? Fucking plain?
[45:04.660 --> 45:05.260]  I think we're good.
[45:07.800 --> 45:08.840]  You've obviously, sir,
[45:08.960 --> 45:11.120]  have never had pizza-flavored Pringles.
[45:11.920 --> 45:12.640]  Wow, spicy.
[45:13.240 --> 45:13.560]  Exotic.
[45:14.780 --> 45:15.520]  I don't think it's spicy.
[45:15.520 --> 45:17.220]  I think it just tastes like pizza.
[45:17.700 --> 45:19.780]  Let's prepare ten flavors from our land.
[45:20.300 --> 45:23.520]  I don't know if my land has ten flavors,
[45:23.700 --> 45:24.540]  because that's all we have.
[45:24.880 --> 45:27.100]  Eric and Nick, do you want to try the...
[45:27.100 --> 45:27.500]  Wait, what?
[45:27.620 --> 45:30.100]  Are you talking about eating 30 chips?
[45:32.260 --> 45:34.140]  Is that what you just proposed?
[45:34.300 --> 45:35.720]  Ten flavors each?
[45:36.240 --> 45:36.520]  Yeah.
[45:37.020 --> 45:38.560]  How many chips are in a bag?
[45:40.000 --> 45:41.820]  That doesn't seem like a lot.
[45:41.940 --> 45:43.040]  You're all going to have to eat
[45:43.040 --> 45:44.240]  30 different kinds of...
[45:44.240 --> 45:46.660]  You're not going to run out of steam by 12
[45:46.660 --> 45:48.660]  if you have 18 more.
[45:50.580 --> 45:51.680]  But you don't have one chip.
[45:52.100 --> 45:52.920]  I understand.
[45:53.620 --> 45:55.080]  I understand that.
[45:55.880 --> 45:57.240]  But one chip 30 times...
[45:58.140 --> 45:58.960]  It's like a bag.
[45:59.660 --> 46:01.740]  Especially with the different flavors
[46:01.740 --> 46:02.960]  where you're trying to
[46:02.960 --> 46:05.000]  drill down on them
[46:05.000 --> 46:06.420]  is a lot.
[46:06.760 --> 46:08.040]  That's considerable.
[46:09.260 --> 46:09.980]  Geoff, am I wrong?
[46:09.980 --> 46:11.360]  Is 30 not a lot?
[46:11.600 --> 46:13.580]  I understand what he's saying,
[46:13.780 --> 46:16.160]  but I think it's necessary.
[46:16.500 --> 46:17.600]  And I think that
[46:17.600 --> 46:19.360]  the way we need a palate cleanser,
[46:19.440 --> 46:21.460]  we need to drink some Sprite or water
[46:21.460 --> 46:22.140]  or something in between.
[46:22.240 --> 46:24.720]  Yeah, because sometimes you'll just swallow a quaver
[46:24.720 --> 46:25.920]  and you'll think,
[46:26.700 --> 46:28.480]  I really need something to wash that off.
[46:28.480 --> 46:31.660]  You've got to stop sending these fake ads.
[46:32.040 --> 46:33.440]  You just made that.
[46:34.400 --> 46:34.820]  Quaver.
[46:39.040 --> 46:40.920]  It looks like old people toenails.
[46:41.720 --> 46:42.880]  These names
[46:42.880 --> 46:44.920]  are so fucking funny.
[46:45.460 --> 46:46.120]  Twiglets.
[46:46.300 --> 46:48.620]  Imagine having an argument as a kid going,
[46:48.820 --> 46:49.920]  I like Twiglets.
[46:50.120 --> 46:52.080]  I like Quavers.
[46:52.520 --> 46:54.380]  I like Cheesy Whatsits.
[46:58.780 --> 47:00.620]  These are all...
[47:00.620 --> 47:01.600]  You're going to eat all of these.
[47:01.600 --> 47:03.380]  Nick and Eric, are you getting involved
[47:03.380 --> 47:05.260]  in the chip game? In the crisps?
[47:05.720 --> 47:07.320]  Yeah, sure. We're in.
[47:07.560 --> 47:09.200]  If it means I can have
[47:09.200 --> 47:11.520]  Whatsits and Quavers, I can't wait.
[47:11.760 --> 47:12.920]  Here's what we've got to do.
[47:13.720 --> 47:15.080]  This needs to be supplemental.
[47:15.300 --> 47:16.560]  This needs to be like the apple taster.
[47:17.740 --> 47:19.360]  It's too much for an episode of F***.
[47:20.040 --> 47:21.100]  I need to know,
[47:21.180 --> 47:22.600]  are Whatsits always baked,
[47:22.840 --> 47:24.960]  or is there a non-baked version of a Whatsit?
[47:25.180 --> 47:28.000]  The important thing is they're really cheesy.
[47:28.060 --> 47:29.240]  They're really cheesy.
[47:30.080 --> 47:31.100]  Andrew is right, though.
[47:31.160 --> 47:32.760]  America has Doritos,
[47:33.040 --> 47:35.060]  it has plain Lay's,
[47:35.120 --> 47:37.060]  and it has Sun Chips, and that's what you get
[47:37.060 --> 47:39.440]  everywhere in every store, and there's no variation.
[47:40.160 --> 47:40.780]  It's pretty bland.
[47:41.320 --> 47:41.920]  It's pretty bland.
[47:43.300 --> 47:44.640]  You never get the crazy...
[47:44.640 --> 47:46.800]  Right now, our Lay's is doing a
[47:47.800 --> 47:49.460]  cheese and ketchup mashup,
[47:49.520 --> 47:50.560]  is one of the top flavors.
[47:51.400 --> 47:53.480]  They're rotating in. They always do weird things.
[47:54.040 --> 47:55.280]  I appreciate an odd chip.
[47:56.700 --> 47:57.420]  I also
[47:57.420 --> 47:59.360]  love this idea because I really need things
[47:59.360 --> 48:01.260]  for my 20,000 item list, and this
[48:01.260 --> 48:02.900]  sounds like I got 30, right here.
[48:04.720 --> 48:05.420]  Look, we
[48:05.420 --> 48:07.320]  got... I'm looking at Doritos
[48:07.320 --> 48:09.180]  flavors right now. We got
[48:09.180 --> 48:11.240]  Spicy Nacho, we got
[48:11.240 --> 48:13.320]  Flamin' Hot Nacho. Those are two different
[48:13.320 --> 48:15.400]  flavors. We got
[48:15.400 --> 48:16.940]  Spicy Sweet Chili.
[48:17.160 --> 48:19.140]  There you go, three flavors right there, that are all
[48:19.140 --> 48:21.400]  essentially the same thing. Backyard BBQ.
[48:22.360 --> 48:23.320]  Do you ever have the crisps that you
[48:23.320 --> 48:25.060]  would make into a car, and then eat?
[48:25.620 --> 48:26.060]  What?
[48:26.800 --> 48:28.860]  They're like little transformers. What?
[48:30.160 --> 48:30.540]  This is it.
[48:32.160 --> 48:33.140]  There you go.
[48:33.940 --> 48:34.820]  Transformer snack?
[48:35.120 --> 48:37.520]  That's so good! You get the middle piece,
[48:37.640 --> 48:39.500]  and then you get little rings, and you build
[48:39.500 --> 48:41.600]  it into a small car, and then you eat the whole lot.
[48:41.860 --> 48:43.920]  I take back
[48:43.920 --> 48:45.200]  everything I said defending
[48:45.200 --> 48:46.900]  our chips. This is...
[48:46.900 --> 48:48.460]  We're outclassed.
[48:48.640 --> 48:50.520]  They have chips that are toys.
[48:50.520 --> 48:51.300]  This is unfair.
[48:52.840 --> 48:53.800]  Wow. Wow.
[48:54.340 --> 48:56.260]  This would be a great
[48:56.260 --> 48:58.420]  supplemental. I think
[48:58.420 --> 49:00.420]  you've won all of us over with one
[49:00.420 --> 49:02.540]  fucking image, dude. Yeah, I don't want to eat Doritos,
[49:02.680 --> 49:03.620]  I want to eat a car.
[49:05.780 --> 49:06.740]  I feel
[49:06.740 --> 49:08.380]  like the way to do this is
[49:08.380 --> 49:09.940]  we have to secretly
[49:10.760 --> 49:12.360]  create our collections, and
[49:12.360 --> 49:14.400]  then maybe we open the box and reveal
[49:14.400 --> 49:16.420]  what everybody put in it. I don't know
[49:16.420 --> 49:18.460]  how to logistically do this, but I feel like that's
[49:18.460 --> 49:20.300]  the funniest. You've had several spoilers
[49:20.300 --> 49:21.580]  for what's going to be in my package.
[49:22.680 --> 49:24.500]  I would do that with Bits and Bites
[49:24.920 --> 49:26.380]  myself, but I never had a
[49:26.380 --> 49:28.500]  like, I would get the pretzel stick, and I
[49:28.500 --> 49:30.580]  put all the little Cheerios to fill
[49:30.580 --> 49:32.140]  the stick with it, and then I'd eat it
[49:32.140 --> 49:34.200]  once it was like a Cheerio
[49:34.780 --> 49:36.520]  pretzel stick thing, but I've never
[49:36.520 --> 49:38.280]  seen Transformers snack.
[49:38.360 --> 49:40.280]  Why don't we do this in person? Why don't we make this the first
[49:40.280 --> 49:41.940]  in-person thing? I mean, that's so
[49:42.380 --> 49:44.220]  fucking far from now, but I... Oh, Andrew,
[49:44.300 --> 49:45.480]  when does the ankle bracelet come off?
[49:47.060 --> 49:47.460]  Uh...
[49:47.460 --> 49:49.540]  I don't know. I don't know
[49:49.540 --> 49:51.440]  the answer to that. I'm not...
[49:51.440 --> 49:53.380]  You want me to travel to a different country
[49:53.380 --> 49:54.920]  to eat a Transformer snack?
[49:55.660 --> 49:57.460]  Yeah. Why does this... We did an
[49:57.460 --> 49:59.420]  Apple review, not in person, a thing
[49:59.420 --> 50:01.440]  I was much more excited about where I couldn't
[50:01.440 --> 50:03.520]  eat them, and you want
[50:04.040 --> 50:05.220]  to do Transformers.
[50:06.200 --> 50:06.600]  Why?
[50:08.360 --> 50:09.460]  Just sounds really fun.
[50:09.860 --> 50:11.560]  It does sound fun. I can't argue that.
[50:11.640 --> 50:13.480]  That's a great point. I have a
[50:13.480 --> 50:14.980]  question. I have a question for you, Andrew.
[50:15.400 --> 50:17.540]  Okay. So given that
[50:17.540 --> 50:19.500]  Canada is kind of
[50:19.500 --> 50:21.680]  a situated... a country that's
[50:21.680 --> 50:23.760]  situated in, it kind of equally siphons
[50:23.760 --> 50:25.460]  off culture from the UK
[50:25.460 --> 50:27.240]  and America, do you have
[50:27.240 --> 50:28.800]  10 Canadian potato chips?
[50:29.240 --> 50:30.920]  Yeah, for sure. Well, not necessarily...
[50:30.920 --> 50:33.460]  Can we include, like, Cheezies in that type of thing
[50:33.460 --> 50:34.940]  as well? What's Cheezies?
[50:35.160 --> 50:37.600]  Like Hawkins. Like a Hawkins Cheesy.
[50:37.760 --> 50:39.000]  I don't know what that is.
[50:39.120 --> 50:40.860]  I think that's one right there.
[50:40.860 --> 50:42.080]  So that's...
[50:42.080 --> 50:44.800]  So you just gotta come up with nine more. Is that like me
[50:44.800 --> 50:45.940]  saying, can I use Frazzles?
[50:46.640 --> 50:47.220]  No, wait.
[50:49.880 --> 50:50.800]  Crispy bacon!
[50:59.270 --> 51:00.690]  Why are they all named...
[51:01.310 --> 51:03.070]  Nick's right. It's like dog treats.
[51:03.270 --> 51:05.190]  Why are they all named like this?
[51:05.550 --> 51:07.270]  This is the craziest fucking...
[51:07.270 --> 51:09.610]  Is there a way I can take a Wazit
[51:09.610 --> 51:11.410]  into Frazzle and put
[51:11.410 --> 51:13.590]  wheels on the Transformer snack on it?
[51:13.730 --> 51:15.490]  Oh my God. Oh my God, we can make
[51:15.490 --> 51:17.130]  the ultimate crisp!
[51:17.650 --> 51:18.710]  Wait a second. It's like...
[51:19.970 --> 51:21.390]  Is Chester Cheetah
[51:21.390 --> 51:23.030]  not a representative of Cheezies?
[51:23.790 --> 51:24.710]  What's Cheezies?
[51:25.190 --> 51:27.570]  Has nobody here heard Cheezies before?
[51:27.910 --> 51:29.450]  No, dude. Chester Cheetah's
[51:29.450 --> 51:30.630]  fucking Cheetos. No!
[51:31.690 --> 51:32.890]  No, you're kidding...
[51:32.890 --> 51:33.270]  No.
[51:34.330 --> 51:36.890]  I think I tombst myself.
[51:37.870 --> 51:38.950]  Did you mess up?
[51:39.370 --> 51:42.030]  I think I've tombst myself my entire life.
[51:42.450 --> 51:43.470]  Are you deep in the cove?
[51:43.470 --> 51:44.290]  When I said
[51:45.490 --> 51:47.230]  Cheezies, I was referencing
[51:47.230 --> 51:48.670]  a Chester Cheetah product.
[51:49.070 --> 51:50.990]  You certainly have the puffs
[51:50.990 --> 51:53.410]  and then the hard ones. We have cheese puffs
[51:53.410 --> 51:55.390]  and Cheezies. Those are Cheetos. I know they're Cheetos
[51:55.390 --> 51:57.050]  but I thought... The big ones are
[51:57.050 --> 51:59.270]  cheese puffs. Are Hawkins Cheezies?
[51:59.350 --> 52:01.210]  Is that where I'm... I didn't
[52:01.210 --> 52:03.210]  invent Cheezies. Hawkins
[52:03.210 --> 52:05.450]  Cheezies. Gavin's over here
[52:06.230 --> 52:07.130]  like... Okay.
[52:07.850 --> 52:09.330]  What the fuck is that?
[52:10.630 --> 52:11.190]  Hawkins
[52:11.190 --> 52:13.330]  Cheeties exist. Okay, so I got
[52:13.330 --> 52:15.350]  that's the mix-up. I'm over here like
[52:15.350 --> 52:15.610]  what?
[52:17.070 --> 52:18.730]  Oh, you guys haven't tried
[52:18.730 --> 52:19.370]  snots?
[52:21.090 --> 52:23.770]  It's totally human food. You're gonna love them.
[52:23.770 --> 52:24.970]  Yeah. Oh, what did you try?
[52:25.070 --> 52:27.190]  My favorite flavor of crisps. Beer.
[52:29.270 --> 52:29.730]  Burps.
[52:30.330 --> 52:31.590]  I can't have that one.
[52:32.130 --> 52:33.030]  Oh, that's fucking funny.
[52:33.030 --> 52:35.110]  It is Burps chips. This is great.
[52:35.190 --> 52:37.210]  I'm excited for this. So wait, you said Hawkins
[52:37.210 --> 52:38.910]  Cheezies but then you said Chester Cheetah
[52:38.910 --> 52:40.890]  and he's not on this thing. These look like they're
[52:40.890 --> 52:43.070]  packaged in the 1930s. What is this?
[52:43.450 --> 52:44.470]  It's like the top
[52:44.470 --> 52:45.170]  Cheesy.
[52:47.010 --> 52:48.770]  What the fuck are you saying?
[52:49.130 --> 52:51.110]  How else would I describe
[52:51.110 --> 52:52.990]  those? Like what type of snack
[52:52.990 --> 52:54.810]  is that? Is that a corn-based?
[52:55.070 --> 52:57.110]  This looks like a snack you would get at the
[52:57.110 --> 52:59.270]  at the zoo in 1912.
[52:59.570 --> 53:00.790]  No, they're delicious. They're
[53:00.790 --> 53:02.870]  incredible. It looks like something
[53:02.870 --> 53:04.730]  you'd get in a Little League game in the
[53:04.730 --> 53:05.470]  1980s.
[53:05.470 --> 53:05.850]  Yeah.
[53:09.350 --> 53:11.630]  You don't eat this under a big top.
[53:12.510 --> 53:13.690]  You're completely right.
[53:13.910 --> 53:15.650]  But they are incredible. I just
[53:15.650 --> 53:17.590]  don't know what to call the snack. What is a
[53:17.590 --> 53:19.430]  Cheetah? Like what is the general
[53:19.430 --> 53:21.730]  term for it?
[53:22.910 --> 53:23.790]  Yeah, a
[53:23.790 --> 53:25.450]  cheese puff. A cheese puff?
[53:25.750 --> 53:27.650]  But they have puffs.
[53:27.950 --> 53:29.470]  They have a puff variety. You're getting
[53:29.470 --> 53:31.430]  too granular. It's just cheese puff
[53:31.430 --> 53:33.770]  is the way to describe it. You're getting too granular.
[53:33.770 --> 53:35.830]  Let's stop you before you
[53:35.830 --> 53:37.730]  go further. What's the best Doritos
[53:37.730 --> 53:39.830]  flavor? I'm not a Doritos guy.
[53:40.290 --> 53:40.830]  What?
[53:41.330 --> 53:43.690]  I'm not a Doritos guy. What's regular?
[53:44.190 --> 53:45.670]  The regular like nacho
[53:45.670 --> 53:47.550]  like default. Nacho cheese.
[53:47.830 --> 53:49.770]  Yeah, I think I really do
[53:49.770 --> 53:51.750]  think that's the best Dorito flavor.
[53:52.230 --> 53:53.870]  I think everything else is fine.
[53:53.910 --> 53:55.510]  You don't like Cool Original?
[53:56.250 --> 53:57.770]  Well, in America we
[53:57.770 --> 53:58.790]  call that Cool Ranch.
[53:59.190 --> 54:01.730]  I guess Ranch isn't a flavor
[54:01.730 --> 54:03.010]  in England, so they
[54:03.790 --> 54:04.830]  just call it Original.
[54:05.830 --> 54:07.390]  That's me. I'm a Cool Original.
[54:07.930 --> 54:08.890]  I wonder if
[54:11.610 --> 54:13.630]  I wonder if Cool Original
[54:13.630 --> 54:15.870]  Doritos taste exactly like Cool Ranch Doritos
[54:15.870 --> 54:17.430]  or if there is some sort of difference.
[54:17.830 --> 54:19.710]  I bet they are the exact same, but
[54:19.710 --> 54:21.550]  that's worth testing. Yeah, it is worth testing.
[54:21.570 --> 54:23.950]  Why don't I bring that from my land and you bring Cool Ranch
[54:23.950 --> 54:24.570]  from your land?
[54:25.790 --> 54:27.670]  Okay, I'll bring it from my land, which you also
[54:27.670 --> 54:28.230]  live in.
[54:29.430 --> 54:30.270]  I'll grab it from
[54:30.270 --> 54:31.790]  the grocery store that we both go to.
[54:35.170 --> 54:36.250]  No, I'm happy
[54:36.250 --> 54:38.250]  to do the work. I just thought it was
[54:38.250 --> 54:39.470]  interesting the way you phrased it.
[54:39.870 --> 54:42.030]  As if we don't live three miles away from each other.
[54:42.110 --> 54:42.550]  That's true.
[54:43.970 --> 54:46.350]  Nick posted a Zapps earlier. That is a respectable
[54:46.350 --> 54:48.350]  US chip. The Voodoo Flavor is not bad.
[54:48.350 --> 54:49.870]  Zapps are fucking great. Zapps are pretty good.
[54:50.370 --> 54:51.570]  I'll give Zapps some credit.
[54:51.710 --> 54:54.150]  We need to do this. You don't have Miss Vickie's?
[54:54.510 --> 54:55.890]  No, we do, but they're fine.
[54:55.890 --> 54:56.810]  They're bland.
[54:58.230 --> 54:59.470]  Miss Vickie's fucking
[54:59.470 --> 55:00.990]  jalapeno chips are amazing.
[55:02.850 --> 55:04.070]  Very residue-y, though.
[55:04.310 --> 55:05.490]  Really gotta wash your hands after them.
[55:05.890 --> 55:06.390]  Yeah, that's true.
[55:07.210 --> 55:08.370]  We should wrap up.
[55:10.230 --> 55:11.850]  LeBron James, Flamin' Hot Cheddar
[55:11.850 --> 55:12.550]  and Sour Cream.
[55:12.690 --> 55:12.810]  I'm not ever going to eat those.
[55:12.810 --> 55:14.150]  I'm not ever going to eat those.
[55:15.110 --> 55:15.670]  I'm not ever going to eat those.
[55:22.910 --> 55:24.090]  I'm not ever going to eat those.
[55:24.970 --> 55:25.770]  Notice says
[55:25.770 --> 55:28.050]  Flamin' Hot Cheddar and Sour Cream by
[55:28.050 --> 55:30.190]  LeBron James. What creative input
[55:30.190 --> 55:31.350]  do you think he had in this?
[55:31.690 --> 55:34.170]  According to the commercial, because I've seen
[55:34.170 --> 55:35.530]  it a thousand times in the playoffs,
[55:35.890 --> 55:37.910]  he ate a Flamin' Hot Ruffle
[55:37.910 --> 55:39.210]  and he went, this is delicious.
[55:39.650 --> 55:42.030]  Then he ate a Cheddar and Sour Cream
[55:42.690 --> 55:44.330]  Ruffle and he thought, this is also delicious.
[55:44.790 --> 55:46.290]  Then he had a light bulb over his head
[55:46.290 --> 55:48.190]  and he put them both in his mouth at the same
[55:48.190 --> 55:50.330]  time and ate it. Then he said, I'm a genius.
[55:50.970 --> 55:52.410]  Then I think he became the creative director.
[55:52.410 --> 55:53.630]  I regret asking.
[55:54.070 --> 55:55.410]  I'm pretty sure that's how that works.
[55:56.110 --> 55:58.390]  This is a weird episode, but I enjoyed it.
[55:59.370 --> 56:00.870]  I had a good time.
[56:01.390 --> 56:02.170]  That was strange.
[56:02.430 --> 56:04.370]  This is a strange one. I'm just looking
[56:04.370 --> 56:06.610]  at crisps. I'm just so excited to make this package.
[56:07.090 --> 56:08.390]  Stop spoiling stuff!
[56:08.870 --> 56:10.810]  The second episode is always weird, man.
[56:11.330 --> 56:12.030]  It depends.
[56:13.870 --> 56:16.470]  It's always something. Sometimes it's
[56:16.470 --> 56:18.390]  amazing. Sometimes it's a home run, but it's
[56:18.390 --> 56:19.890]  never a home run in the way you think it'll be.
[56:22.290 --> 56:24.430]  Oh, man.
[56:25.310 --> 56:25.690]  I...
[56:25.690 --> 56:26.410]  Did you...
[56:26.410 --> 56:28.310]  So, Gavin, because we need to wrap up.
[56:28.570 --> 56:30.790]  Did you get to the eight things
[56:30.790 --> 56:32.270]  that you wanted to talk about?
[56:33.170 --> 56:34.230]  We got through a few of them.
[56:34.390 --> 56:36.590]  What are you talking about?
[56:36.650 --> 56:37.770]  We got through a few of them.
[56:38.850 --> 56:40.630]  We spent 25 minutes
[56:40.630 --> 56:42.990]  on chips and you had notes to use?
[56:44.110 --> 56:44.490]  Uh...
[56:45.590 --> 56:47.130]  Geoff, did you go through all your notes?
[56:47.330 --> 56:48.810]  No, not at all. I was looking through here.
[56:48.810 --> 56:50.130]  This is insane!
[56:50.390 --> 56:53.010]  I've got, look, my notes. Guy found his baseball.
[56:53.550 --> 56:54.950]  I've got Smee
[56:54.950 --> 56:56.710]  delivered socks. I've got tea towel.
[56:57.350 --> 56:58.870]  We don't need to recap all the things we've
[56:58.870 --> 57:01.010]  talked about in the last two things. This is curious.
[57:01.450 --> 57:02.270]  Why are you asking?
[57:02.750 --> 57:04.830]  Well, because I was out of notes and I assumed we went
[57:04.830 --> 57:06.890]  20 minutes on chips because we were note-less
[57:06.890 --> 57:08.750]  at this point. No, I think we were just really into chips.
[57:08.950 --> 57:10.910]  I got really into chips halfway there.
[57:11.470 --> 57:12.790]  I got some I didn't get to, mainly
[57:12.790 --> 57:13.890]  because I don't understand them.
[57:14.430 --> 57:16.290]  Tuna fish can spill in the sea?
[57:16.290 --> 57:17.170]  What does that mean?
[57:18.610 --> 57:20.210]  Tuna fish can spit
[57:20.210 --> 57:21.750]  in the sea? Spill.
[57:22.130 --> 57:22.950]  Spill in the sea.
[57:23.390 --> 57:26.110]  Tuna fish can spill in the sea.
[57:26.810 --> 57:28.470]  Yeah, I don't know what that is, but that was fun.
[57:28.470 --> 57:30.390]  You should, when you write down a note,
[57:30.490 --> 57:32.350]  you should write the date next to it so you can at least
[57:32.350 --> 57:34.210]  narrow it down to what you were doing in the world.
[57:34.730 --> 57:36.510]  I had, uh...
[57:36.510 --> 57:38.350]  This is a good one. After our, after the
[57:38.350 --> 57:40.310]  pool party for my birthday we had,
[57:40.610 --> 57:42.230]  and we had so much fun with the rings
[57:42.230 --> 57:44.370]  and stuff, and we'll cover this later, but I was thinking
[57:44.370 --> 57:46.530]  I think the time is right
[57:46.530 --> 57:48.650]  for us to invent the new
[57:48.650 --> 57:50.050]  like the new hot
[57:50.050 --> 57:52.370]  pool game. Like Marco Polo
[57:52.370 --> 57:53.490]  is old. It's tired.
[57:53.870 --> 57:56.270]  I think that, and
[57:56.270 --> 57:57.770]  I was thinking we could combine it with swans.
[57:58.350 --> 58:00.230]  I don't know what this is, but I wrote down
[58:00.230 --> 58:02.310]  swan king of the hill. So like
[58:02.310 --> 58:03.450]  maybe there's something there.
[58:03.770 --> 58:06.330]  Or we could investigate something else. So that's something
[58:06.330 --> 58:08.310]  we can talk about later. And we talked about the tuxedo DVD
[58:08.310 --> 58:09.870]  cover. Oh!
[58:10.630 --> 58:12.310]  I have a new business idea
[58:12.310 --> 58:14.330]  that we can talk about later, that I
[58:14.330 --> 58:16.270]  think you'll really like, Andrew. I think it's
[58:16.270 --> 58:18.370]  aligned with some of your stuff. And there's two
[58:18.370 --> 58:20.250]  different angles of that. I don't go too
[58:20.250 --> 58:22.250]  far. Okay, yeah, this is a nice teaser for
[58:22.250 --> 58:24.150]  an upcoming episode. But definitely
[58:24.150 --> 58:26.450]  have two products we can sell that I think will do really well.
[58:26.930 --> 58:28.410]  Uh, talked about the corn dog update.
[58:29.030 --> 58:29.970]  Bean hole days.
[58:30.750 --> 58:32.170]  Checked on Gavin's CPAP farts.
[58:33.110 --> 58:33.950]  Oh, death diving!
[58:34.310 --> 58:36.230]  I want to talk to you guys about death diving. Have you
[58:36.230 --> 58:37.970]  seen it? No, but we'll save it.
[58:37.970 --> 58:40.270]  Are you guys familiar? We'll save it for a future episode. I think I
[58:40.270 --> 58:42.150]  want to see a sport that is perfect
[58:42.150 --> 58:43.350]  for us to compete in.
[58:44.430 --> 58:46.410]  Should I research this between episodes?
[58:46.590 --> 58:48.250]  I would appreciate it if you didn't.
[58:48.350 --> 58:48.550]  Okay.
[58:49.670 --> 58:51.330]  That's a long way to say no.
[58:52.790 --> 58:54.090]  Well, you know, I'm a little more
[58:54.090 --> 58:55.050]  florid with my speak.
[58:57.270 --> 58:57.990]  Yeah, I
[58:57.990 --> 58:59.810]  actually found it through the community. It was on the subreddit.
[59:00.050 --> 59:02.030]  Somebody posted a link to it. And then I spent
[59:02.030 --> 59:03.670]  all night watching death diving videos.
[59:04.050 --> 59:05.710]  I think it's right up our alley.
[59:06.070 --> 59:07.910]  Awesome. And I think that we will probably find
[59:07.910 --> 59:09.830]  ourselves in Norway next year at the
[59:09.830 --> 59:11.230]  death diving competition.
[59:11.390 --> 59:13.650]  As long as it doesn't overlap with bean fest.
[59:14.370 --> 59:15.410]  No, bean day is
[59:15.410 --> 59:17.310]  the priority. Bean hole day is the priority.
[59:18.190 --> 59:20.030]  Dude, I want
[59:20.030 --> 59:21.610]  to get Gavin crowned the bean king.
[59:22.570 --> 59:23.730]  I would love that.
[59:24.410 --> 59:25.030]  King bean free!
[59:26.770 --> 59:28.090]  Yeah, we'll have to make better beans
[59:28.090 --> 59:28.450]  for that.
[59:30.030 --> 59:31.470]  I guess we probably stop though, huh?
[59:31.570 --> 59:31.750]  Yeah.
[59:33.810 --> 59:35.190]  I always hate to stop.
[59:36.290 --> 59:36.770]  Bye!
[59:37.590 --> 59:39.490]  Skips prawn cocktail.
[59:39.870 --> 59:41.210]  What does that say? Light and
[59:41.210 --> 59:43.250]  malty? That's
[59:43.250 --> 59:45.150]  disgusting. No, light and melty.
[59:45.590 --> 59:46.190]  Light and melty?
[59:46.570 --> 59:49.070]  Dude, my eyes are getting old.
[59:50.590 --> 59:51.450]  Light and...
[59:51.450 --> 59:52.550]  So the chips melt?
[59:53.650 --> 59:54.390]  They melt on your tongue.
[59:55.010 --> 59:55.870]  With a prawn flavor.
[59:59.100 --> 01:00:00.260]  That's fucking disgusting.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.520]  I think we lost Andrew at some point.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.020]  Thanks for listening to another
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.420]  episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.080]  If you enjoyed it, please tell a friend
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:10.800]  or an acquaintance or an enemy.
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:13.020]  If you've ever met somebody else
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:14.980]  on the planet Earth, let them know about
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:17.060]  our podcast. There's seven and a half billion people
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:19.100]  who are currently alive. Most of
[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:21.040]  them have ears. Most of them aren't using them
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.960]  for this, and we really would appreciate it if they did.
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.020]  And I guess Gavin and Andrew, I won't
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:26.960]  see you guys for a while. So it was nice hanging out for
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.820]  a little bit. Gavin, if I see you in public
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:31.120]  somewhere, I'd appreciate at least a nod.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:32.740]  I'll definitely give you a nod.
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:33.100]  Bye!
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.660]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here
[01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:38.860]  with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.920]  What a shocker! The guys haven't
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.860]  recorded yet again. So here are
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:44.860]  a few predictions for you. The tuxedo
[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:46.220]  isn't in great condition.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.300]  Eric gets frustrated by Pantin.
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:50.820]  Geoff doesn't want to hit any more balls.
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.440]  Jack gets promoted again.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.680]  Does anyone remember when Andrew was going to become a
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:56.700]  basket weaver? Gavin forgot to hit
[01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:58.900]  record. And once again, Andrew
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.680]  does not eat the pencil. All that
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:02.800]  and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
