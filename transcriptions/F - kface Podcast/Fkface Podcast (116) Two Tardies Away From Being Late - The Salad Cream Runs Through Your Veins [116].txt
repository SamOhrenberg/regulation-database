[00:15.040 --> 00:22.720]  He did it! He's on time! Wow! Wow! He showed up! Look at you! Hello and welcome to another
[00:22.720 --> 00:29.180]  episode of the F*** Face Podcast. I don't know the number, year, volume, none of that's
[00:29.180 --> 00:32.840]  important anymore. My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin
[00:32.840 --> 00:38.300]  Free. Gavin, congratulations, you made it exactly on time. I didn't remember to mute
[00:38.300 --> 00:43.560]  my speaker there. That was quite loud. What do you mean? I didn't hear it. Yeah. Didn't
[00:43.560 --> 00:48.660]  come through at all. Which is interesting because last week you were late by a couple
[00:48.660 --> 00:53.660]  minutes and then I was tuning in to one of our sister podcasts this week, the Rooster
[00:53.660 --> 00:58.240]  Teeth podcast, which is one of the other ones that you frequent, and you were a good, I
[00:58.240 --> 01:04.020]  would say nine minutes late to that one. And that got me wondering, do we need to have
[01:04.020 --> 01:10.400]  some sort of an on-time intervention? What is happening in your life that the bedrock
[01:10.400 --> 01:17.980]  that you stake claim to being punctual is no longer attainable for you? I could get
[01:17.980 --> 01:21.240]  a car. I think that would help quite a lot. You think that's what it was when you didn't
[01:21.240 --> 01:26.160]  show up to F*** Face? But you haven't had a car before. Well, I got yelled at last time.
[01:26.160 --> 01:30.780]  I got yelled at by Geoff when I stormed off and got to the podcast early without saying
[01:30.780 --> 01:35.520]  hello to anyone. Yeah, but I didn't see you yesterday, so that was... I didn't make you
[01:35.520 --> 01:39.420]  late to the RT podcast with a hello this week. Coming in hot off another video. There's
[01:39.420 --> 01:45.460]  not enough time. People not showing up on time. Now I'm late. I have been late a lot.
[01:45.520 --> 01:48.700]  I hate being late. It seems like a trend. Yeah. I just want to make sure everything's
[01:48.700 --> 01:53.160]  OK personally, if you're not experiencing any trouble or trauma or issues. Do you take
[01:53.160 --> 01:57.360]  some time away? No, I'm just... I mean, if you could see me, I'm not scrambling around
[01:57.360 --> 02:04.280]  trying to make it on time. I'm just stood there waiting for a car to show up. How late
[02:04.280 --> 02:08.580]  would you have to be before you just didn't show up at all? What's your line? Oh, that's
[02:08.580 --> 02:15.000]  a great question. Um, I don't physically know how I could be an hour late. Yeah, I think
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.700]  I'm in the same boat. I think I would just come anyway. Really? Yeah. I guess it depends
[02:20.700 --> 02:24.940]  on the thing. If I'm supposed to be there at a certain time, if I'm 45 minutes late,
[02:24.940 --> 02:31.300]  I'm just not going to show up. I'm just not going to go. Dude, I one time had dinner with
[02:31.300 --> 02:38.480]  previous CEO of the company Ezra years and years ago in San Francisco, and he showed
[02:38.480 --> 02:45.100]  up to dinner that he booked at a sushi restaurant that he wanted to take me to three hours late.
[02:46.720 --> 02:51.500]  Yeah, I've had that same... I had that same thing with him. You just didn't go. You didn't
[02:51.500 --> 02:55.860]  show up. You missed three hours late. You didn't go. He just didn't go. And he would
[02:55.860 --> 02:58.720]  keep texting me like, I'll be there in 45 minutes. I'll be there in 45 minutes. Showing
[02:58.720 --> 03:02.440]  up three hours late is the same as showing up the day after. Like, oh, you got the date
[03:02.440 --> 03:07.580]  wrong. That's how late that is. He made a dinner reservation at seven o'clock and we
[03:07.580 --> 03:14.840]  ate dinner at like 945. That's ridiculous. Yeah. Busy people, I guess. I feel like y'all
[03:14.840 --> 03:19.520]  though, I think if you're more than 45 minutes late, you just you can't make it. You just
[03:19.520 --> 03:25.160]  can't show up that late. Yeah. It removes the lateness in my mind. If I never go, then
[03:25.160 --> 03:30.860]  I was never late. Like, like, is that the point? Do you think like 44 to 45 minutes
[03:30.860 --> 03:36.280]  is when it crosses over it like the needle passes from late to absent? I think it also
[03:36.280 --> 03:40.440]  depends on if you're in contact with that person. Hmm. That's a great point as well.
[03:40.700 --> 03:45.380]  Like did you, were you texting Ezra when you were away? Yeah, he was texting me going,
[03:45.380 --> 03:49.140]  hey buddy, I'll be, I'll be there in 45 minutes, running a little late. 45 minutes later.
[03:49.440 --> 03:54.020]  He probably took a different meeting after that. He was probably wasn't even in San Francisco.
[03:54.140 --> 03:58.880]  He's probably taking a plane to San Francisco. He's in the wrong state. It was like that was
[03:58.880 --> 04:02.720]  six, seven years ago. It was a while ago. I don't know. It's not nice to be known for
[04:02.720 --> 04:07.980]  being late. I feel like if you're usually on time, then it's... How many more, how many
[04:07.980 --> 04:13.140]  more tardiness tardies would you have to have before you admit you have a problem? I think
[04:13.140 --> 04:17.340]  I'm two tardy appearances away from being someone who's late.
[04:20.480 --> 04:25.160]  Now, is this a system that clears or is it like consecutive? It's like when your shield
[04:25.160 --> 04:29.620]  recharges. If I go like six months without any lateness, I think I could then potentially get
[04:29.620 --> 04:34.220]  three late, lates before I'm a late person again. But I've used up like, I feel like I've used up
[04:34.220 --> 04:39.940]  two, two lives recently. The problem, the problem with that is that's, that's absolutely how that
[04:39.940 --> 04:45.480]  works. But the scale is so difficult. It's kind of like how it's like so easy to lose your
[04:45.480 --> 04:50.120]  parents' trust, but so hard to gain it back. Totally. It takes so much more work to get it
[04:50.120 --> 04:55.080]  back than it did, than the offense. I feel like it's this, like you can get, you can definitely
[04:55.080 --> 04:59.780]  knock three or four of those, at least three of those tardies off, but it's an inordinate amount
[04:59.780 --> 05:05.500]  of time. It is. And it takes forever to reverse that. If you become a late guy, it's going to
[05:05.500 --> 05:10.540]  take four years of on time before you could reverse that, as opposed to like missing two
[05:10.540 --> 05:14.740]  things every six months. You don't get the perception. Once you have that label, you can't
[05:14.740 --> 05:19.640]  shake it. Do you think six months is enough time to recharge the shield of one lateness? Oh, for
[05:19.640 --> 05:25.160]  sure. Yeah, I think so. I would say though, if you're just looking at amount of effort and work,
[05:25.200 --> 05:31.020]  if you think it's possible that you might be late two more times in the next, I don't know,
[05:31.020 --> 05:36.640]  three months or so would probably be the window. I would consider just changing my personality to
[05:36.640 --> 05:42.220]  a little late guy. I think it might be easier than trying to repair the damage to just go all in and
[05:42.220 --> 05:46.260]  embrace it. Become a different person. I just could not double down on that. I just don't,
[05:46.340 --> 05:51.700]  I don't have that in me. Because I would be the biggest hypocrite in the world. I hate it when
[05:51.700 --> 05:59.020]  people are late. I guess, I don't know, it would be a philosophy change, right? You wouldn't be a
[05:59.020 --> 06:05.340]  coming-to-lateness moment where you realize, you know what? This is the life I've been missing.
[06:06.040 --> 06:12.560]  From everybody else. Andrew, your wordsmithing is phenomenal this week.
[06:14.400 --> 06:18.660]  Oh, man. I'm glad you were able to make it on time, Gavin. Yeah. I'm glad you were here.
[06:18.920 --> 06:22.360]  Because last time, it was rough. We had a rough start with that. Things kind of collapsed.
[06:23.220 --> 06:28.740]  It was bad pleasantries last time. I wrote down on my notes to have an on-time intervention with
[06:28.740 --> 06:35.540]  you. But this is not what this was. This is more just like concerned friends giving you a heads-up
[06:35.540 --> 06:39.840]  than an intervention could be on the horizon with a few more tardies under your belt.
[06:39.880 --> 06:43.400]  Yeah. I mean, I feel like off a podcast would be a nicer place to do that. But sure.
[06:47.160 --> 06:51.180]  Dude, it's impossible to stay off the podcast. Andrew approached me last week and said,
[06:51.240 --> 06:55.920]  hey, man, we need to talk. And I was like, okay. And he goes, you and I, we need a thing.
[06:55.920 --> 07:00.020]  We don't have a thing right now. It's not basketball season. It's not hockey season.
[07:00.760 --> 07:04.420]  But we have been out of sync on that for a while anyway. It was collecting cards for a while,
[07:04.500 --> 07:09.000]  but then we turned that into content. We built a show around it. We need a thing that you and I do
[07:10.260 --> 07:15.000]  to maintain our friendship in the off seasons of basketball since we lost some of the other
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.340]  things that we had. And the second he presented that to me, all I could think about is what kind
[07:20.340 --> 07:25.020]  of things we could come up with for the show. Even today, I was like, I think I'm missing the
[07:25.020 --> 07:29.640]  point of this whole exercise because everything you bring up, I just want to turn into content.
[07:30.080 --> 07:35.340]  That's fair. I then tried to make the case of what if we made the fact it isn't content content?
[07:35.600 --> 07:39.480]  What if that's the content? The thing that we were doing, this thing that we don't ever talk
[07:39.480 --> 07:43.580]  about, but we talk about that we're not talking about. Two guys try not to make content.
[07:44.280 --> 07:46.300]  I guess. Yeah. What a terrible...
[07:47.200 --> 07:50.540]  It's just like, this all goes to say, Gav, I think it's impossible to have this conversation
[07:50.540 --> 07:56.640]  off the podcast because the podcast is now 23 hours of a day of our lives.
[07:59.560 --> 08:02.900]  It's it's a weird thing to try to think of hobbies in that way, too.
[08:03.700 --> 08:07.700]  I've never really been like, I need to find a thing. It's always been like I come across
[08:07.700 --> 08:12.620]  something and think that would be great. The best idea I've had so far and just try to think
[08:12.620 --> 08:19.520]  of hobbies to come up with is Geoff and I becoming metal detector guys, like buying a metal detector,
[08:19.520 --> 08:24.000]  like being the people that walk on a beach, I guess. I don't know. Like, I like the idea.
[08:24.900 --> 08:28.940]  Yeah, that's that was the problem. And it then turned into what if it was like a sport
[08:28.940 --> 08:34.480]  where you have like a field of dirt and there are bean holes everywhere and you have to try to find
[08:34.480 --> 08:39.800]  the one of the beans like you got to go find a cast iron. Yeah, exactly. It turned into a whole
[08:39.800 --> 08:46.360]  thing. Oh, man. It's very quickly, suddenly we're writing content for the show. We are.
[08:46.360 --> 08:49.500]  Yeah. Challenges for survivor, I guess.
[08:51.140 --> 08:54.160]  What's the mix of like discovery and competitive eating? Like,
[08:54.240 --> 08:57.400]  imagine if Joey Chestnut had to find the hot dogs.
[08:58.840 --> 09:03.260]  Like it's a two layer thing that we're doing here. I don't think competitive
[09:03.260 --> 09:10.700]  eating has ever had competitive searching. He had to have military land navigation skills.
[09:11.080 --> 09:12.560]  He's out there with a compass.
[09:14.280 --> 09:21.360]  That's where we've been at. It's great. I love it. There could be ones with fake beans. I don't
[09:21.360 --> 09:26.420]  know. We have a lot that we could possibly work with with the jelly beans. Jelly beans would be
[09:26.420 --> 09:32.000]  great. Dude, imagine if you dug up a bean hole and then for dessert, you dug up a jelly bean hole.
[09:34.760 --> 09:39.380]  I'm imagining it being like a little little bean container within the bean container,
[09:39.380 --> 09:45.740]  like a Russian doll type thing. Just be like a slab of sugar. It's just melted.
[09:49.240 --> 09:53.780]  I'd be terrible if you melted a bunch of jelly beans, like every flavor in the one thing.
[09:54.120 --> 10:00.820]  I'd be awful. I think so. Yeah. If you if you melted every flavor simultaneously,
[10:01.360 --> 10:05.100]  I bet that's terrible. I bet it tastes like nothing, but it's just unpleasant.
[10:05.100 --> 10:10.420]  I gotta admit something to you guys. I'm excited. What's your confession?
[10:10.700 --> 10:16.240]  The other night we were cooking, it was one of those nights where nobody got a hold of
[10:16.240 --> 10:20.700]  dinner ahead of time. So it was just sort of like make whatever you can find laying around the house.
[10:21.640 --> 10:29.280]  And Emily found some corn dogs in the freezer. State Fair corn dogs. And she put them on the
[10:29.280 --> 10:32.820]  air fryer and she cooked up some corn dogs and they smelled so fucking good.
[10:34.400 --> 10:39.980]  I thought about eating one. You didn't do it though? But I didn't do it. Wow. See, that would
[10:39.980 --> 10:44.440]  have been the perfect corn dog update as opposed to last week when you just brought it up and nothing
[10:44.440 --> 10:49.680]  happened. Yeah. And then something happened. Right. And it was just like it was almost like
[10:49.680 --> 10:52.820]  as I was almost like they like mentioning it last time willed it to happen this time.
[10:53.220 --> 11:00.120]  It was close. I would say I was like I was like 40, 60 on eating it. Yeah, it was. Wow. Yeah.
[11:00.120 --> 11:06.720]  What could have tilted the scale? What was the if I hadn't? Honestly, if I hadn't had a
[11:07.240 --> 11:13.580]  microwave pizza to. Oh, wow. Or a frozen pizza. I got saved by a pizza. Yeah. And how long was
[11:13.580 --> 11:20.340]  that in the freezer? Screaming Italian pizza. The corn dogs or the pizza? Pizza. Probably three
[11:20.340 --> 11:25.640]  weeks. OK. Three weeks to a month, I would say. I can't remember when I bought it, but I bought it
[11:26.600 --> 11:31.200]  not not too too long ago. Certainly not like three days ago. How does that make you feel,
[11:31.280 --> 11:35.740]  Andrew? That's fine. People can shop how they shop. I just have never considered shopping that
[11:35.740 --> 11:40.460]  way. I did want to clarify within this episode. I don't want to pivot away, Geoff, if you have more
[11:40.460 --> 11:44.980]  to expand. I got nothing else. That's why I just had another update. We've talked about it for a
[11:44.980 --> 11:50.860]  long time. I think I'm going to do the grocery cap thing next. Well, the end caps, the end caps.
[11:50.860 --> 11:55.580]  But I had some questions I wanted to clarify before we did this. I was going to start,
[11:55.980 --> 11:59.800]  I was thinking like maybe Wednesday next week. So it'd be a day in when we recorded.
[12:01.040 --> 12:05.480]  So it's the end caps. Is there any other restrictions? Like, I'm assuming I can't
[12:05.480 --> 12:10.180]  use the back of the store at all, you know, because there's like the open like deli. Yeah,
[12:10.180 --> 12:14.840]  nothing on the walls, nothing on the walls, nothing like none of the little island cases
[12:14.840 --> 12:18.700]  that are kind of between the different things purely. I mean, I feel like if there's an island,
[12:19.300 --> 12:26.280]  you could potentially shop off the end of the island. Yeah, yeah. Islands actually seem okay
[12:26.280 --> 12:31.060]  to me if they're in like the larger thoroughfare. I would say if you have to go down a lane
[12:32.020 --> 12:36.340]  to get to it, I would think that'd be a no, because that would be past the end caps. I feel
[12:36.340 --> 12:41.960]  like you can't traverse past an end cap. So islands are okay as long as I don't hit the
[12:41.960 --> 12:46.940]  middle of whatever the content is of the island. I mean, I would be okay with that. How about you,
[12:46.940 --> 12:52.620]  Gav? Yeah, why don't we just say you plant your feet at the end cap, whatever you can reach is...
[12:53.460 --> 12:56.520]  No, because he's going to come up with, he's going to create some sort of a pole arm
[12:56.520 --> 13:03.000]  with a grapple on it. Yeah, no, no, it's got to be from the end cap. Yeah, I can't go into the row
[13:03.000 --> 13:08.040]  at all. It has to be an end cap. Is there any restrictions on how much of an item I could get?
[13:09.000 --> 13:13.400]  No, I don't, I don't think so. Really? So if you're going to have access to a lot of batteries,
[13:13.400 --> 13:17.340]  you might as well buy them. No, I feel like because there's always, it's going to really
[13:17.340 --> 13:21.280]  come down to what's in the freezer end cap, I feel like, because there's always that kind of like
[13:21.280 --> 13:28.140]  open freezer section area that's end cap. I might just like have to buy 20 pizzas.
[13:28.720 --> 13:34.360]  That just might be what my life is. Now, how do we feel? How do we feel about the,
[13:34.540 --> 13:39.980]  like the impulse buy section at the checkout? Are we okay with the magazines and the Archie
[13:39.980 --> 13:44.220]  comics and point of sale stuff? Yeah, point of sale stuff. Are we okay? I feel like that's got
[13:44.220 --> 13:48.400]  to be fair game. It's not really. No, because they put a bunch of different convenient stuff there.
[13:48.600 --> 13:52.580]  That's going to make it too easy, I think. You think so? But not to survive off of. It's going
[13:52.580 --> 13:57.640]  to be like fucking Pringles and chocolate bars. I guess it's true. It's like Snickers and gum.
[13:57.740 --> 14:02.960]  You never, if he wants to live off off Kinder eggs, he can, I guess. Yeah, like I'm not,
[14:03.120 --> 14:07.600]  that's a good point. You never see a bag of rice at the checkout, like nobody is buying real food
[14:07.600 --> 14:14.420]  at the Express. It's true. It's mainly, it's mainly like gum mints and magazines about what
[14:14.420 --> 14:20.980]  Meghan Markle's been doing. You want to take away my gum, Gavin? You mockster. One other point of
[14:20.980 --> 14:24.240]  clarification I think needs to be made here that just popped into my head. I'm trying to think of
[14:24.240 --> 14:31.340]  ways that Andrew could flaunt the system. I've already thought of one. If you go to an end cap
[14:31.340 --> 14:36.800]  and there's an out of place item in the end cap, like a bag of flour and you just happen to need
[14:36.800 --> 14:42.220]  flour or whatever. I feel like that's off limits. It's not from the end cap. It's not of the end
[14:42.220 --> 14:46.560]  cap. It shouldn't be able, it shouldn't be accessible as such because then you could have
[14:46.560 --> 14:51.480]  your partner go in and get like a bunch of frozen goods you need or eggs and then place them
[14:51.480 --> 14:56.440]  strategically around the grocery store for you to find. And I just, I feel like we got to head
[14:56.440 --> 15:01.220]  that off now. Yeah, my thinking was that Andrew would befriend the store owner and ask for a
[15:01.220 --> 15:08.100]  custom end cap to be made for him. He's gonna get milk and bread in the same end. You know, that's just as plausible.
[15:08.720 --> 15:13.740]  Yeah, I appreciate my head was not there but that is a great, it would be a workaround for sure.
[15:14.800 --> 15:21.580]  So end caps only, islands are okay within a certain distance, checkout is okay and it's one week,
[15:21.660 --> 15:25.920]  right? That's the goal? Survive a week off end cap. Can I go to the grocery store as much as I want to?
[15:26.040 --> 15:30.880]  Yeah, I think so. Okay. Yeah, I kind of don't want you to eat 14 pizzas though
[15:30.880 --> 15:35.500]  because I think you'll die. Yeah, I know. Well, I think that's on you. You think that's what's gonna kill him? You and I
[15:35.500 --> 15:39.320]  approached that differently. I was like, I feel like that'd just be kind of a lame way to do this.
[15:39.560 --> 15:44.620]  It'd be almost too easy. I mean, it'd be lame but also it's terrible. He's gonna have access to like
[15:44.620 --> 15:50.940]  Cheez-Its, powdered donuts and Gatorade. Like there's not gonna be a lot of food out there for him.
[15:52.120 --> 15:56.300]  He's gonna have access to ice cream cones but not ice cream.
[15:59.460 --> 16:05.320]  And are you gonna... is this one store or are you gonna end cap multiple stores? I think I'm gonna just go to one store.
[16:05.600 --> 16:10.160]  I think that should be part of it. I appreciate... the rules of this could be ridiculous. Like you guys
[16:10.160 --> 16:15.040]  can make it so if it's like aisle six, I can get up to six items. Like there are all sorts of
[16:15.040 --> 16:19.160]  restrictions you could do with this thing. This seems kind of simple. I'm pretty confident that
[16:19.160 --> 16:23.760]  this will be fine. Yeah, I think we crawl before we walk and then run. We got plenty of life ahead
[16:23.760 --> 16:29.360]  of us to come up with aisle six stuff. Are you gonna be able to document or provide pictures of
[16:29.360 --> 16:32.940]  what you eat each day? Yeah, yeah, I will. That's what I honestly think the funniest photo will be.
[16:33.000 --> 16:38.340]  It will be whatever my first haul looks like of stuff from the end cap. Can we have... can I get
[16:38.340 --> 16:43.380]  with the social team and have one... at least have a daily update on the f***face Instagram? Absolutely.
[16:43.680 --> 16:48.140]  Okay, that'd be fantastic. 100%. What if we open it up to... he can also forage.
[16:49.580 --> 16:56.340]  I can like hunt? Or like get berries? Or like walk through the woods and find mushrooms and sh**?
[16:56.460 --> 17:02.760]  No, he's gonna poison himself eating sh** that he thinks is food. There's no way. I'm definitely
[17:02.760 --> 17:10.320]  getting a metal detector now. This isn't a season of Alone on Netflix. I just love the idea of Andrew
[17:10.320 --> 17:15.380]  treating it like he's lost in like a solo expedition but he's just in the middle of his
[17:15.380 --> 17:20.900]  own town that he lives in. I'm gonna get arrested going into an old backyard of a place I used to
[17:20.900 --> 17:24.420]  live at that I know has an apple tree. It's gonna... it's gonna be bad. You're gonna get
[17:24.420 --> 17:32.980]  arrested for scrumping, you dirty bastard! Oh my god. Okay, so I think I got it. I don't think
[17:32.980 --> 17:37.380]  I'll salad cream this in any way. It seems very straightforward. I'm excited to start this process
[17:37.380 --> 17:42.760]  next week. Here's the thing with you, though, about salad creaming. I don't think you intend
[17:42.760 --> 17:48.940]  to salad cream. Oh, very rarely. I think the cream runs through your veins. Very rarely, yeah.
[17:56.650 --> 17:58.910]  What percentage do you think runs through my veins?
[18:01.030 --> 18:05.870]  If I did one of those, like, ancestry, like, spit in a tube thing, what percentage,
[18:06.070 --> 18:21.400]  what percent cream am I? I'm gonna guess 30. I think you've gotta... you gotta sit down.
[18:22.600 --> 18:32.540]  Yes, Eric says six months of no salad cream. You have to be almost halfway there. Here's how you
[18:32.540 --> 18:37.800]  avoid it. You have to sit down with yourself before you present anything or post anything
[18:37.800 --> 18:44.340]  or decide anything. Just sit down and think, what... what is Geoff and Gavin after, all right?
[18:44.420 --> 18:50.480]  What do we want from it? What are we trying to see? And just try and provide it. Just try and
[18:51.000 --> 18:56.340]  visualize that and go for that goal. Okay. Oh, I don't think I salad cream this. There is a
[18:56.340 --> 19:01.540]  potential for a salad cream. I sent... I mean, if it's on an in-cab, absolutely.
[19:04.640 --> 19:10.360]  I sent the Cosmic Crisp people a DM the other day because they followed me on Twitter. I was like,
[19:10.760 --> 19:16.120]  hey, type thing, reaching out, saying hi. I brought up the podcast that we reviewed,
[19:16.120 --> 19:21.720]  Cosmic Crisp, and they replied back being like, hey, it's so great. We appreciate the support
[19:21.720 --> 19:27.520]  so much. Could you link us the episode in which you guys talk about this? Because the team, I'm
[19:27.520 --> 19:33.100]  sure, would love to listen to it. God. So then I was in a real dilemma. I didn't know what to send.
[19:33.340 --> 19:37.140]  Because I could either... You've done it again, you son of a bitch! You tuxedoed it!
[19:37.760 --> 19:45.180]  Stop emailing people! You're ruining everything! Stop drawing people's attention to us who we
[19:45.740 --> 19:50.920]  shit on on this podcast! Well, that's the problem. Let us shit under the radar, man!
[19:51.740 --> 19:57.480]  Because I could send the Cosmic Crisp review we did, but it's almost all of you guys saying this
[19:57.480 --> 20:02.540]  isn't that great. This is very average, which I don't think is reflective of the opinions of the
[20:02.540 --> 20:07.920]  show, necessarily. In our defense, well, in their defense, we would just talk about how it's just
[20:07.920 --> 20:14.320]  an apple. Yeah. An apple is an average. Yeah. So I think as an apple, it's good, but it is still
[20:14.320 --> 20:20.120]  just a 6 out of 10 fruit. So then I sent them... I picked the one I had to go into our catalog and
[20:20.120 --> 20:25.380]  find the episode of where I reviewed the Cosmic Crisp. But that is just a general episode,
[20:25.540 --> 20:32.560]  which that happens in. I also gave a review, then realized that it was a pink lady and had to do a
[20:32.560 --> 20:38.900]  second review. There's no way to submit them anything that isn't heavily edited.
[20:38.900 --> 20:49.860]  I would send them both unedited full videos or audios and then let's just find a new fruit.
[20:50.320 --> 20:56.260]  Let's get into pears. Yeah, I haven't heard back. Might as well just be honest with them
[20:56.260 --> 21:00.200]  about what it is and who we are, and then we'll just, you know, we'll pivot onto another
[21:01.260 --> 21:05.980]  like another round fruit. Oranges are popular. Everybody loves an orange.
[21:05.980 --> 21:11.460]  I don't. I feel like I rarely see anything about a new orange. Not a fucking lot of work to get to
[21:11.460 --> 21:17.500]  an orange to it. I hate it. I hate it. Really? I like less than peeling an orange. Yeah, I guess
[21:17.500 --> 21:21.500]  like I was going to say. I don't want shitty fingers, man. You can't you can't eat orange
[21:21.500 --> 21:25.500]  without having shitty little kids, sticky fingers like you're five years old sitting
[21:25.500 --> 21:32.160]  on your grandma's back porch. I hate it. But Eric just said just bite in. Are you are you serious?
[21:32.160 --> 21:38.760]  What are you doing? Nobody just bites into an orange. Yeah, I mean, you got to be the
[21:38.760 --> 21:43.700]  change you want to see in the world. So if you don't want if you don't want sticky fingers,
[21:43.780 --> 21:48.320]  just take a bite and then spit it out and pretend like you're doing a grenade or something, you
[21:48.320 --> 21:52.400]  know, and then you have to bite. You have to bite all the way around. You got to buy all the peel
[21:52.400 --> 21:56.160]  off. Yeah, that's the problem. Yeah. But I think you could probably peel some with your teeth and
[21:56.160 --> 22:00.100]  kind of work it through. And it's not as sticky on your fingies, maybe like once you get it started.
[22:00.100 --> 22:04.360]  Yeah, a little bit of that juice out. You know what we need to do? This sounds like a problem
[22:04.360 --> 22:08.740]  for a uniform. Boy, we haven't talked about uniform in a while. Uniform combining the power
[22:08.740 --> 22:14.580]  of one of the fabric of the farm uniform. We should invent fruit gloves. What do you mean?
[22:14.940 --> 22:23.640]  You mean gloves? Special gloves, special gloves for you to use that make it that enhance the
[22:23.640 --> 22:28.260]  fruit eating experience. Obviously, they have to do more than just cover your fingers from
[22:28.260 --> 22:34.220]  the stickies. That's I'm presenting the problem with which we will come up with a solution for.
[22:34.280 --> 22:38.620]  We have to we have to figure out how to enhance these gloves. We can do that. We can do that.
[22:38.880 --> 22:42.520]  No, I think there's a way we can. I think this way we can improve upon the glove. I don't know
[22:42.520 --> 22:46.320]  what it is yet, but now my mind is off to the races. So I'll get back to you guys in a few
[22:46.320 --> 22:50.160]  days. I assume you'll have something to buy then. So you're taking gloves which protect your hands
[22:50.160 --> 22:54.840]  from multiple different things and you're making a version of gloves specifically for fruit.
[22:54.840 --> 22:58.560]  Yeah, fruit gloves. Hold on, let me write this down on my phone so I remember to do it.
[22:59.960 --> 23:05.680]  Invent fruit gloves. He's gonna look at this in two hours and go, what the fuck is fruit gloves?
[23:05.780 --> 23:10.820]  Why did I write this down? Well, I wrote invent fruit gloves. So it's like it's a full sentence.
[23:11.360 --> 23:16.620]  I got it. Huh. I'll be fine. I think you got this. Maybe like padding on the fingertips.
[23:17.080 --> 23:22.300]  Well, there's a lot of. Yeah, there's a lot for every fruit. It's like there's a lot of variation
[23:22.300 --> 23:25.180]  too on how you were. Well, that's going to be a part of the thing is like there's a lot of
[23:25.180 --> 23:29.400]  different fruits and I assume different fruits have different needs, you know, so I'll have to
[23:29.400 --> 23:33.660]  spend some time thinking about about the particularities of each fruit and how to how to
[23:33.660 --> 23:38.460]  get the most out of it. Like are the needs of a grape the same as the needs of an orange? No.
[23:38.880 --> 23:45.960]  So how does the glove help bring both to their flavor forefront? We'll have to figure that out.
[23:46.120 --> 23:49.280]  It's like when you're buying a cable or something and it tells you what compatible
[23:49.800 --> 23:54.620]  like devices it has. I want to buy gloves that say like can't be used with cherries.
[23:55.160 --> 23:59.180]  Right, right. I want to know what the specifics are for these things. These gloves don't support
[23:59.180 --> 24:04.580]  4K. Right. These are these are pear and mango gloves. They don't do not open a banana with
[24:04.580 --> 24:09.340]  these gloves. It'll go badly. Yeah. Like, yeah, absolutely. We are rated for different fruits.
[24:09.920 --> 24:15.340]  We are one or two ideas away from having a fantastic Kickstarter scam of like it can tell
[24:15.340 --> 24:22.180]  the rightness when you touch it. Get the most fresh fruit. Oh, that's great. Wi-Fi enabled.
[24:22.640 --> 24:28.060]  This is great. We got a complete scam that we can work with. I love this. Yeah. Are you guys
[24:28.060 --> 24:37.260]  kiwi skin peelers or eaters? Oh, neither. I'm a peeler, I guess. I'm not crazy about kiwi skin.
[24:37.920 --> 24:43.460]  I do peel, but only once. You peel once? Yeah, like I'll get a spoon and then I will
[24:43.460 --> 24:48.280]  take the top off and then I will just eat the innards without peeling anything else.
[24:48.560 --> 24:53.060]  Yeah, that's how I used to kiwi. Now I eat a kiwi like an apple. And it's just the same.
[24:53.560 --> 24:58.220]  Can I ask a question? Yeah. How do you eat an apple? As Eric would peel an orange.
[24:59.240 --> 25:04.700]  Just bite in. Like a grenade. Got it. All right. Kiwis are very throwable. They'd make for great
[25:04.700 --> 25:08.780]  grenades. If there's going to be a grenade fruit, I think I'd go kiwi. You got weight,
[25:09.060 --> 25:12.260]  but it's not too heavy. Pretty small, though. Probably a small explosion.
[25:12.700 --> 25:16.960]  Well, that doesn't necessarily equate, does it? Size of thing to explosion?
[25:18.320 --> 25:21.220]  You think like a smaller thing will have a bigger explosion?
[25:21.740 --> 25:25.400]  Well, I think it could potentially. I'm just saying that just because it's small doesn't
[25:25.400 --> 25:29.820]  mean the explosion won't be big. That's true. I'm also saying that like I'm basing this off
[25:29.820 --> 25:35.000]  of action movies I've seen. So I don't think that that's an accurate representation of what
[25:35.000 --> 25:39.060]  the thing is capable of. I think a lot of the time is like chain reaction explosions is like
[25:39.060 --> 25:42.680]  how many pounds of shit you've put in there. I guess you just change what's in there.
[25:42.800 --> 25:47.220]  That's true. Very valid point. You know that Chicken Soup for the Soul makes movies?
[25:48.020 --> 25:53.400]  You know what they're doing? Not that we're a movie podcast, but they exist still and they make
[25:53.400 --> 25:56.560]  movie. I watched this movie. I know we're not a movie. What did they make?
[25:56.840 --> 26:01.720]  What did the movie? Here, I'll just post a thing. Can you post a link to the movie?
[26:02.280 --> 26:08.240]  Yeah, I'm going to. They made a bunch. Is it like a like a GAC movie or something?
[26:08.240 --> 26:11.800]  No, I thought it was a joke. So this is a movie I watched earlier this week called
[26:11.800 --> 26:16.700]  Willie's Wonderland with Nicolas Cage. And the premise is like the Five Nights kind of thing.
[26:16.740 --> 26:22.240]  Yeah. Yeah. It's like a guy going through town. He has to clean an arcade and the machines come
[26:22.240 --> 26:26.700]  to life and he has to kill them. It opened with a Chicken Soup for the Soul production.
[26:26.960 --> 26:30.660]  I was like, is this a joke? And no, they make movies.
[26:31.120 --> 26:32.880]  What does Chicken Soup for the Soul normally do?
[26:33.320 --> 26:37.300]  I was like self-help books. Yeah, they're like huge. I forgot they existed,
[26:37.300 --> 26:40.880]  but they were massive when I was growing up. Like the 90s was a big thing.
[26:41.320 --> 26:45.060]  Like the evolution of brands. They make dog food now. It's very weird.
[26:45.520 --> 26:50.420]  No idea they existed yet. No Chicken Soup for the Stomach. Seems like a no brainer.
[26:52.220 --> 26:56.460]  Unifar. Unifar. Yeah. Actual Chicken Soup assholes.
[26:58.520 --> 27:04.480]  I didn't have another thing happen. Not my fault, but we've been discovered by a different group.
[27:06.140 --> 27:11.460]  And this is a weird one. You can't blame them. I know 30% cream is not my fault.
[27:12.680 --> 27:17.300]  So I've talked a lot about my hubby's bagels. We love them. They're great. Great business.
[27:17.420 --> 27:22.480]  They're very sweet. I don't think I've ever mentioned on the show that the cupcake place
[27:22.480 --> 27:27.280]  I like, a wee cupcakery, is like a 20 second walk from my hubby's bagels.
[27:27.680 --> 27:31.780]  Oh, do you always kill two birds with one stone? I will often do both things,
[27:31.780 --> 27:37.920]  but I've just, I don't know. It's never really come up in my mind. And so my mom was recently
[27:37.920 --> 27:43.560]  buying something from the cupcake replace, and she knows the lady that runs it. And they're
[27:43.560 --> 27:48.940]  still back and forth. And the woman said, I was so funny. I had somebody in here earlier today
[27:49.510 --> 27:57.020]  who came here purely just because of a podcast that they listen to, that they really enjoy.
[27:57.600 --> 28:02.780]  And my mom was like, oh, what was the podcast? And I'm like, uh, they didn't want to say the name.
[28:03.220 --> 28:07.580]  And then my mom was like, did they also mention my hubby's bagels a lot? She's like, yeah,
[28:07.580 --> 28:10.120]  they also mentioned that, that they go to my hubby's bagels all the time, too.
[28:10.420 --> 28:15.920]  So they now know we exist. They know f***face is a thing. And she's like, yeah, I listened to an
[28:15.920 --> 28:20.980]  episode to like, to hear the mention of the thing, because we've mentioned it before. I've never been
[28:20.980 --> 28:25.460]  more terrified. Because the thing that came to mind immediately for me is when I dropped the
[28:25.460 --> 28:32.320]  cupcake on the floor. Oh, yeah. The cupcake floor saga. And now knowing that like she knows who I am
[28:32.320 --> 28:38.440]  and she knows she next time I go in there, there's a possibility that she will know that I
[28:38.440 --> 28:44.520]  ate one of her cupcakes that I dropped on the floor. And that's a level of monster that I
[28:44.520 --> 28:49.380]  don't want to deal with in my personal life in like a real way. So I'm kind of scared to go back in.
[28:49.880 --> 28:54.740]  Yeah, I'm going to agree. Nick wrote in the chat. What a ringing endorsement for them,
[28:54.740 --> 28:59.120]  though. I completely agree. Incredible. Like so good, you'll eat it off the floor.
[28:59.460 --> 29:05.040]  The but then I didn't for this was this happened like last week. So I don't know if if they just
[29:05.040 --> 29:12.040]  listened to a recent episode or if they somehow heard that specific episode. But I don't know
[29:12.040 --> 29:16.020]  how you'd even find that episode because I don't I don't feel like it's ever been named.
[29:16.240 --> 29:20.020]  So I don't know what the details are, but there's a possibility that next time I go in, she will
[29:20.020 --> 29:24.420]  know that I ate a cupcake off the floor. Here's what you do. You dazzle and distract her before
[29:24.420 --> 29:28.960]  she has an opportunity for it to register. I got an idea for you. You love my hubby's bagels.
[29:29.280 --> 29:35.120]  You love this cupcake store, right? What is a cupcake? A yummy, delicious cylinder? What is
[29:35.120 --> 29:40.680]  a bagel? A circle with a hole in the middle? You convince her that they need to create a some sort
[29:40.680 --> 29:46.180]  of a pop up crossover event like like Savage Fendi, where they where they make a cupcake that
[29:46.180 --> 29:51.060]  you stick in a bagel and you call it the bagel cake and then it'd be all over everywhere.
[29:51.860 --> 29:55.840]  I like the idea. I'm a bit shit left and right today, but you get her so excited about that
[29:55.840 --> 30:01.420]  that that that floor eating cupcake incident will be so far in the rearview mirror, it'll
[30:01.420 --> 30:07.140]  it'll never pop up again. That's a great point. I've Googled f*** face cupcake story and I've
[30:07.140 --> 30:13.000]  been taken to a Reddit post that says PSA don't eat while listening to today's f*** face. Oh no.
[30:14.040 --> 30:21.460]  Yeah, that's fair. Which is from, I don't know, April 14th, 2021. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty easy
[30:21.460 --> 30:26.300]  to find. That's unfortunate. Geoff, I like your idea. Through other people's disgust.
[30:27.680 --> 30:31.460]  I was thinking that I might just need to glue another mustache to my face when I go in.
[30:31.840 --> 30:36.740]  No, I think I think you give them you dangle something in front of them that's more exciting
[30:36.740 --> 30:41.440]  than the embarrassment of the cupcake eating, and then you just leapfrog ahead of it.
[30:41.440 --> 30:44.720]  OK, I'll go with that approach. I'll keep you updated.
[30:49.740 --> 30:54.340]  This message is brought to you by BetterHelp. It is so incredibly important to take care of
[30:54.340 --> 31:00.360]  your mind. Now, how you do that is really up to the person. For some, working out makes a really
[31:00.360 --> 31:06.000]  big impact, going on runs or walks, going to the gym. For me, music really helps video games.
[31:06.600 --> 31:11.180]  Naps are great. There's also BetterHelp online therapy. Now, I've talked a lot about
[31:11.180 --> 31:16.280]  therapy in the past for me and how that has made a tremendous impact in my life,
[31:16.400 --> 31:21.200]  and I would strongly recommend it to anybody who is currently going through something. Or if you're
[31:21.200 --> 31:27.040]  considering trying therapy, I personally would highly recommend it. BetterHelp is online therapy

[34:35.840 --> 34:43.440]  Oh no, Nick found the episode title, F*** Face A Bunch Of Toilet Stories Slash The First F*** Face
[34:43.440 --> 34:49.200]  App. You would not think a bunch of toilet stories would include an endorsement of cupcakes.
[34:49.840 --> 34:58.680]  Uh-huh. Oh no. I'm so f***ed, I can't go back. No, you might not. It's over.
[35:00.300 --> 35:03.000]  S***. Your mom's gonna be doing a lot of shopping for you.
[35:05.340 --> 35:11.720]  Would you need to change about your appearance until it was like Clark Kent levels of disguise
[35:11.720 --> 35:15.920]  where it's not ridiculous but people aren't seeing you? That's tough because I'm not,
[35:15.920 --> 35:21.220]  you know what, actually very minimal. As a not pants guy, I think I throw a pair of pants on,
[35:21.360 --> 35:28.920]  nobody's gonna think it's a good point. As a no pants, no hat guy, throw a hat on,
[35:29.000 --> 35:36.000]  throw some pants, there's no way. 0% chance. I saw the best comment recently. It was
[35:36.000 --> 35:41.660]  talking about your keyboard saga and how it's very strange that you could see a woman pissing
[35:41.660 --> 35:45.700]  from like hundreds of feet away out your window, but you can't see the F row of keys.
[35:46.500 --> 35:52.480]  Very different circumstances. Dude, speaking of comments, can I take a second to mention
[35:53.240 --> 35:58.740]  a Reddit post I saw the other day? And also speaking of endorsements, I think this is an
[35:58.740 --> 36:03.880]  endorsement for the power of Gavin. Did you see the thing posted in the F***face subreddit by this
[36:03.880 --> 36:12.000]  poor guy? The username is Bob from Boston. His thread was Gavin's bad luck red socks.
[36:12.560 --> 36:17.780]  And then he wrote, in June, the Boston Red Sox were one of the hottest teams in baseball with
[36:17.780 --> 36:22.200]  a record of 20 and six for the month. You're not a baseball fan, Gavin? That's a very good record.
[36:22.320 --> 36:28.560]  20 wins, six losses. After Gavin first brought up his sock dilemma on June 29th, the Red Sox have
[36:28.560 --> 36:35.040]  been one of the worst teams in baseball, finishing July with a record of eight wins and 19 losses.
[36:35.460 --> 36:40.300]  Coincident? I think Gavin has somehow jinxed the team without even knowing it. This is how
[36:40.300 --> 36:47.820]  real this curse is. You've taken down a 120-year-old baseball franchise. They haven't
[36:47.820 --> 36:52.120]  been cursed. Do you know how long it took them to get over their last curse? It took them like
[36:52.120 --> 36:59.860]  70 years to get past the last curse. Jesus Christ, dude. These socks are gonna be powerful. They're
[36:59.860 --> 37:04.540]  gonna be a big deal. I was thinking, because we were talking about doing the thing where I curse
[37:04.540 --> 37:08.400]  100 pairs of socks or something, and I'll sign a little thing to go with them. And I'm thinking
[37:08.400 --> 37:15.060]  of using the red socks that I have in the curse. I'm thinking of putting those on my hands. I'm
[37:15.060 --> 37:19.660]  waving them over the other socks to spread the curse. But I think I have to use the sauce.
[37:20.920 --> 37:26.600]  So Eric and I were having a conversation yesterday about this exact thing, and we were going to bring
[37:26.600 --> 37:32.080]  it to you. We want to do a one-hour live stream where you curse all the socks live.
[37:32.800 --> 37:37.400]  I want people to see, and I'm really glad that you brought up wearing the socks on your hands.
[37:37.400 --> 37:44.100]  That's exciting. Because visually, for an hour, as we slide socks in front of you and you curse
[37:44.100 --> 37:48.540]  them, it's gonna be really good content. I think people are like, truly, we're gonna see
[37:48.540 --> 37:54.020]  how long it takes for you to curse, I mean, all these socks. I mean, I think it should be taken
[37:54.020 --> 37:58.380]  seriously. I don't think it's gonna be very funny watching me do this. This is gonna be a real
[37:58.380 --> 38:02.020]  curse. We're gonna have some other stuff. We're gonna have some other stuff going on. We're gonna
[38:02.020 --> 38:06.840]  get a mannequin, and we're gonna put the tuxedo on the mannequin. Which, by the way, I went into
[38:06.840 --> 38:11.940]  Eric's office today, and I saw the tuxedo with my own eyes. It exists. Where is this office that
[38:11.940 --> 38:23.660]  Eric has? It's in Stage 4. And so, we're gonna put the tuxedo on a dress form, or on a mannequin,
[38:23.920 --> 38:28.060]  and then we're gonna take a Polaroid. Every time you curse a pair of socks, I'm gonna take a
[38:28.060 --> 38:32.900]  Polaroid picture of the tuxedo, and then give that away with the socks, so that everybody gets their
[38:32.900 --> 38:37.560]  own Polaroid picture of the tuxedo. How fucking cool is that? Yeah, I don't see how they're related
[38:37.560 --> 38:43.000]  at all, but that is... It's like a little bonus to throw in. I mean, I'm with Gavin, but I'm also with Geoff.
[38:43.180 --> 38:50.040]  You know what I mean? Yeah, totally. They're called a sweetener. Yeah, I like it. I'm into it. I want to share
[38:50.040 --> 38:53.480]  the tuxedo with people as soon as possible, and this is the first way I could think of.
[38:53.820 --> 39:00.620]  In the merch thread on Slack, Tony posted a mock-up of the cursed socks, and then Maxie
[39:00.620 --> 39:06.540]  from social chimed in and said, will you be selling uncursed versions? I really want those
[39:06.540 --> 39:13.300]  socks, but I'm superstitious. So I just said... Well, basically, I wanted to say no. Like, there's
[39:13.300 --> 39:18.560]  not gonna be any uncursed versions, but I promised I would do a very mild curse on hers.
[39:18.860 --> 39:26.380]  Can I ask this? Do you think that you using your red socks to curse these other red socks
[39:26.380 --> 39:34.840]  will dissipate the cursed nature of your socks? Like, you're passing smaller curses
[39:34.840 --> 39:39.620]  onto these other socks, and it's like stealing power. So you end up with just, like, socks that
[39:39.620 --> 39:44.200]  you're able to wear by the end. I think this might be a cleanse, because it is diluting across all
[39:44.200 --> 39:49.040]  pairs. So I'll be using my red socks to decurse... Well, I'll be decursing my red socks onto the red
[39:49.040 --> 39:55.140]  socks. Right. But maybe a side effect of that will be that the red socks as a team would get worse.
[39:57.160 --> 40:00.700]  This is an interesting thought. I think it's important you do cover your hands,
[40:00.800 --> 40:06.260]  because there could be a real battle of the curse. Because you're known as the boy with
[40:06.260 --> 40:12.960]  the golden hands, right? So you need to cover those literal golden hands with some red socks,
[40:13.040 --> 40:17.600]  so that way you're not blessing them. You could be cursing and then blessing,
[40:18.140 --> 40:22.320]  depending on how you pass it off. It's important your hands are covered, is all I'm saying.
[40:23.240 --> 40:28.400]  This is so stupid, and I don't know what that's going to look like for an hour. It's like,
[40:28.660 --> 40:35.240]  at best, a 25-second joke. Dude, we'll do other stuff. We'll do other stuff. We'll make it an
[40:35.240 --> 40:41.100]  event. I'll put together a full show. You can even be off to the side, and we can just cut
[40:41.100 --> 40:44.820]  over to you every once in a while, checking on how Gavin's doing, kind of thing, if you want,
[40:44.880 --> 40:50.760]  you know? I'm sure we can fill an hour with other stuff. God knows there's a million different dumb
[40:50.760 --> 40:55.940]  things we could do. We should say, I mean, obviously, it's all bullshit. It's all a load
[40:55.940 --> 41:01.600]  of shite. But I will genuinely feel bad if someone dies wearing these cursed socks. I don't know
[41:01.600 --> 41:07.540]  what to do about that. It's not real, but we've had instances where predictions have been made,
[41:07.620 --> 41:13.520]  and some weird shit happens, and, you know, I gotta be careful. I don't wanna kill someone.
[41:13.900 --> 41:15.180]  But how would you know if that happened?
[41:17.740 --> 41:21.700]  Let's just hope that the person that bought them the socks dies in the same accident,
[41:21.880 --> 41:24.200]  so there'll be no way for the information to get back to us.
[41:24.720 --> 41:31.840]  What if, with the socks, comes a card that gets stuck in your wallet, so when they find your body,
[41:32.160 --> 41:37.080]  it will just have instructions on, like, firstly, check out what colored socks I'm wearing. If I'm
[41:37.080 --> 41:41.820]  wearing these red socks, please call this number, just so we can know how dangerous these socks are.
[41:41.820 --> 41:47.320]  We'll put that- no, I like this, because we'll just put a sign behind the tuxedo, and you just
[41:47.320 --> 41:53.080]  keep your Polaroid in your wallet, so that way you have a picture of the tuxedo, and also a sign
[41:53.080 --> 41:59.060]  that says, if I'm dead and wearing red socks, here's who- contact Gavin Free. I don't understand
[41:59.060 --> 42:03.440]  why you did this. Why? What do you mean? Well, because this opened with you being like, oh,
[42:03.460 --> 42:07.620]  I really hope this doesn't happen, and I bring up- it's an impossibility for you to know,
[42:07.680 --> 42:11.240]  and then you're like, okay, well, let's make it possible. Let's make sure that I do know if it
[42:11.240 --> 42:16.240]  does happen. Well, he likes to solve a problem. Why don't we just say, don't wear them? Don't
[42:16.240 --> 42:21.560]  wear the socks? Well, I think we're doing that regardless, yeah. Do you think people- do you
[42:21.560 --> 42:27.980]  think people would wear them? Dude. Knowing the risks? Dude, that kid that came to RT Monday
[42:27.980 --> 42:32.460]  night on the podcast to eat frozen spaghetti is eating that fucking spaghetti, and that spaghetti
[42:32.460 --> 42:37.060]  is like a year and a half old, and has been frozen and unfrozen like nine times. So yeah, I think
[42:37.060 --> 42:42.380]  people will wear the socks. If anything, I assume you got some red spaghetti sauce in that mix. It's
[42:42.380 --> 42:47.180]  the power of red. It would, if anything, enhance the flavor, I would assume. Why don't we have any
[42:47.180 --> 42:52.920]  current comment leavers just let us know whether you'd be buying these socks to own or to wear,
[42:52.940 --> 42:58.880]  or both. There you go. Hey, Gabo, I had an idea I wanted to run by you. I mean, Andrew, it applies
[42:58.880 --> 43:01.760]  to you as well. We'd have to figure out how to work it in, but you know how you were talking the
[43:01.760 --> 43:07.700]  day about when we filmed SBI. We were talking about how much fun it was for you and I to be
[43:07.700 --> 43:15.920]  in an office together again, and how creatively inspiring it was. And I was thinking, what if we
[43:15.920 --> 43:19.420]  had, you know, because we're both busy boys, and there's not a lot, we have a lot going on, there's
[43:19.420 --> 43:25.940]  not a lot of free time. What if we tried to earmark one day a month that it was office day,
[43:26.020 --> 43:31.640]  and we go and we spend the whole day in an office together, maybe with Eric too, if he's got time,
[43:31.640 --> 43:35.500]  then we can always pip in Andrew somehow. And we just have to, from like nine to five, we're
[43:35.500 --> 43:41.280]  required to be at work together in an office, and only focusing on SBI. Oh, I'd love that. One day,
[43:41.340 --> 43:45.600]  whatever happens, happens. One day a month. I mean, maybe we could expand, we could expand if it's
[43:45.600 --> 43:49.400]  successful, and we get good stuff out of it, and we don't hate each other. But like one day a month,
[43:49.480 --> 43:55.340]  we just, for nine hours, we go and we just walk and talk and speak SBI, and whatever comes out of
[43:55.340 --> 43:58.500]  that day comes out of that day. Let me propose this, because I don't know what everyone's
[43:58.500 --> 44:03.560]  schedule's like, but what if we do like a second Thursday of every month? Thursday's already our
[44:03.560 --> 44:09.880]  episode recording day, so why don't we just build that in and we do like a second or a third Thursday
[44:09.880 --> 44:15.160]  of every month, and that's just like the day, and that's, we got, we got office work. I think it's
[44:15.160 --> 44:19.320]  dangerous to do on a day that we're recording. Yeah, Gavin would like that, because it's technically
[44:19.320 --> 44:23.780]  pleasantries for the thing, any moment. Well, plus, I don't want to see him when we record,
[44:23.780 --> 44:30.400]  so I'd have to go home. I like the, I like the... Okay, are we doing it like on a Friday then?
[44:30.500 --> 44:36.080]  Is that... I could do Friday. I could do Friday. Andrew? Yeah, it doesn't matter to me. I don't
[44:36.080 --> 44:41.980]  care. I don't care. What's the best day for you, Eric? Uh, Thursday, but I can make Fridays work.
[44:42.260 --> 44:46.620]  What about you, Nick? What's your best day? Okay, we can make Friday, like what if we do
[44:47.080 --> 44:53.980]  like every like third Friday, uh, every month, and it's like, like so this month it would be the 19th
[44:53.980 --> 44:58.860]  if we were to actually do it, which I don't think we can this month, but um, like we could make that
[44:58.860 --> 45:04.200]  work. I fucking love that. I think this is awesome. I think Face will benefit, hopefully.
[45:06.500 --> 45:12.140]  We could just do stuff that, yeah, like instead of having to try to like schedule an MVP too,
[45:12.260 --> 45:15.840]  like we could just know like, oh, we got Friday. Yeah, right, right, or like, oh, we gotta hit some,
[45:15.840 --> 45:19.620]  we gotta hit some baseballs, gotta bury beans, like, yeah, absolutely. This will get our shit
[45:19.620 --> 45:25.600]  off the weekends. Yes, big time. And, and I, I really like this idea. I think building a day in
[45:25.600 --> 45:30.640]  where we can all be together and do that is a lot of fun too, because we can grab the other pieces
[45:30.640 --> 45:36.600]  that we need and just sort of like tell everyone to fuck off. We have this thing. And also Friday
[45:36.600 --> 45:41.780]  works because no one's working on Friday anyway. It's fine. That's true. That's true. And, and you
[45:41.780 --> 45:46.460]  can hardly call what we're about to do work. So it fits, slots in perfectly on a Friday.
[45:46.800 --> 45:52.240]  Very true. Speaking of which, we, we should really, I know we're, we just talked about
[45:52.240 --> 45:57.840]  scheduling a whole day, but we should probably try to figure out that MVP thing soon too,
[45:58.240 --> 46:01.140]  because we're starting to stack up. Okay, what are you doing? Okay, what are you doing on the 12th?
[46:02.100 --> 46:06.500]  Let me see. Hold on. Let me look at my calendar. Yeah, man, I think I can do the 12th.
[46:07.140 --> 46:09.780]  I can also do anytime tomorrow or this weekend.
[46:10.940 --> 46:14.360]  Uh, I don't want to do it on the weekend. I have to get stuff off the weekends. I have,
[46:14.640 --> 46:19.820]  I don't want to do anything on a Saturday or Sunday. You have a life? Yeah. The 12th. I have
[46:19.820 --> 46:25.260]  things, I have things to do. Stuff, other stuff. I'm good for the 12th. All right, MVP two on the
[46:25.260 --> 46:32.940]  12th. I'm excited. Hang on, hang on, hang on. No one's not, we, you are moving forward. You are
[46:32.940 --> 46:40.700]  moving forward. You're right. I got excited. Gavin? 12th. Oh, look at that. Look at that.
[46:41.020 --> 46:46.360]  That day is open. Okay. Perfect. Okay. Oh, no, no. My calendar hasn't loaded. Hold on.
[46:48.000 --> 46:53.740]  No! It's open. It's open. Oh, Jesus Christ. A couple of calls, I can move. Okay. What time
[46:53.740 --> 46:57.860]  works best? Like, do we want to make this like a midday thing or like a morning thing? Like,
[46:57.880 --> 47:01.160]  what works best for you guys? I don't know. I just want the tech to be figured out.
[47:01.900 --> 47:06.040]  I wouldn't mind. What if we started our day with it? We had a morning monkey movie
[47:06.040 --> 47:13.220]  and we ate breakfast while we watched it. So what time is that? Because it's two hours
[47:13.220 --> 47:17.400]  difference for where Andrew is. Let's say 11 a.m. our time, 9 a.m. Andrew's time.
[47:18.120 --> 47:25.700]  Monkey mornings. Yeah, monkey morning movie. Fantastic. Okay. Can't imagine watching that
[47:25.700 --> 47:32.040]  movie at 9 a.m. I'm ready to watch it anytime. We can start now. I'd be happy.
[47:32.680 --> 47:39.960]  5 a.m. any hour is an appropriate time to watch MVP 2. I need to record the setup thing then,
[47:40.020 --> 47:44.780]  right? Because you wanted me to do a recap of the first movie to fill you in on the lore
[47:44.780 --> 47:50.800]  going into the second one. I wanted to edit. I got to do that. I'll record that. That's good.
[47:50.800 --> 47:56.480]  Geoff has a... looks like a meeting at 11 a.m., but I put it there anyway, so that's good.
[47:56.980 --> 48:01.100]  What the fuck? What is my meeting at 11 a.m.? Wait, did we just go through this?
[48:01.440 --> 48:05.960]  Yeah, no, we did. No, hey, yeah, Gavin, yes. Yeah, Gavin, yes, we did. Oh, yeah,
[48:05.960 --> 48:11.140]  because I haven't accepted that meeting yet. It hasn't been accepted, so I haven't said yes to it,
[48:11.160 --> 48:14.320]  so I can say no to it. Yeah, done. Okay. You're not going to say no, you're going to say maybe
[48:14.320 --> 48:19.240]  to it. No, I just said yes to the monkey thing. Okay. Yeah, it's way more important.
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.740]  Did we talk about how you said the wrong year last week?
[48:23.260 --> 48:26.140]  Yeah, I should have said year three, but it was... I said year two, but it was...
[48:26.140 --> 48:29.620]  Have you been saying year three or did you... No, no, I just fucked up in that moment. They
[48:29.620 --> 48:36.220]  got me flustered and I got all fucked up. Yeah. Hey, Gavin, when we were... when we were in that
[48:36.220 --> 48:43.140]  office together during the SBI, I told you a story that I had neglected to tell on the podcast
[48:43.140 --> 48:47.600]  because I thought it was too gross. And you told me you didn't think it was too gross and that I
[48:47.600 --> 48:52.020]  should tell that story. Oh God. I don't think it's grosser than Andrew eating a bathroom floor
[48:52.020 --> 48:56.880]  cupcake. That was a low though. That's like... That was a low. That was a low. Well, this is
[48:56.880 --> 49:02.780]  a low for me too. The reason I ask is because I have an update to that story. So I'm wondering
[49:02.780 --> 49:11.740]  if I should tell it or not. A while back this summer before SBI, we were filming. I don't
[49:11.740 --> 49:17.260]  remember. I think it was in June. I was doing a lot of swimming. This is personally embarrassing.
[49:18.260 --> 49:24.440]  And I don't know why because it's totally fine. But I was doing a lot of swimming and I started
[49:24.440 --> 49:32.600]  to get like some dry scratchy skin on my thigh, like right next to my balls. And I thought it
[49:32.600 --> 49:36.360]  was just... I thought like maybe I'm using the blow dryer too much when I go to the dryer or
[49:36.360 --> 49:40.420]  something. I don't know what it is. But it just started to get like more and more irritated. And
[49:40.420 --> 49:46.140]  then one morning I looked, I woke up and it had spread and it was like all down my thigh and it
[49:46.140 --> 49:52.160]  was like kind of up on the front above like my dick shelf kind of area. And it was getting like
[49:52.160 --> 49:58.100]  really painful to touch. And I was like, what the fuck? And so I was embarrassed and I showed Emily
[49:58.100 --> 50:01.480]  and she was like, oh, you probably got like jock itch or something. And I was like, I can't have
[50:01.480 --> 50:05.260]  that. I've never had that in my entire life. Even in five years in the army, I never got jock itch.
[50:05.280 --> 50:11.000]  That's disgusting. How does one even get that? What is jock itch? And also, yes, I'm no jock.
[50:11.000 --> 50:17.480]  I mean, yeah, I can swing a baseball bat. And so I thought, well, I spent a couple of days just
[50:17.480 --> 50:23.380]  putting like Lotrimine on it. And it kept getting worse to the point where I couldn't. It was
[50:23.380 --> 50:28.740]  painful to wear clothes. And so I went to my doctor and I had to show my doctor my business. And he
[50:28.740 --> 50:34.480]  was like, whoa, you've got some jock. You got a hell of a case of jock itch, buddy. And I was like,
[50:34.480 --> 50:40.420]  I've never had that before. And he was like, well, it happens a lot more often than you think. It's
[50:40.420 --> 50:45.680]  a normal thing. It's because if you're if you're if you're outside a lot when it's hot, you're
[50:45.680 --> 50:50.740]  sweating, you know, stuff gets a little musty. It's very easy for it to grow there. Do you swim
[50:50.740 --> 50:54.220]  a lot? And I was like, I swim all the time. I'm jet skiing all the time. I'm in pools, Barton Springs
[50:54.220 --> 50:59.060]  all the time. He's like, you got it. You got it from that. Just like a fungal thing. Yeah, I guess
[50:59.060 --> 51:03.460]  it's like a fungal thing. It's like athlete's cock. It's like it's the same thing as athlete's foot
[51:03.460 --> 51:10.120]  just on your just another area. I think it's like the exact same fungus. Oh, man. And so he was like,
[51:10.120 --> 51:13.940]  what you do is like just bring an extra pair of shorts and just change out of the wet ones
[51:13.940 --> 51:17.540]  into dry ones whenever you get out of the water. And then he gave me some prescription medicine
[51:18.020 --> 51:22.860]  that I had to put on it. I was lucky in that my daughter was out of town for like 10 straight
[51:22.860 --> 51:30.780]  days because it got so inflamed that it was so bad that for nine days I didn't wear shorts or
[51:30.780 --> 51:37.540]  underwear or pants. I walked around. I Andrew Panton did. I Donald Ducked it just in a T-shirt.
[51:37.540 --> 51:45.340]  I wore a T-shirt and socks only. I didn't leave the house for nine days as I beat down this
[51:45.340 --> 51:49.280]  horrible jock itch. And I bring it up. I brought it up to Gavin. I was like, and I think this is
[51:49.280 --> 51:55.280]  probably too close, too gross to tell. But I did record three episodes of F*** Face during it,
[51:55.340 --> 52:01.540]  like completely naked, sitting in the chair, like with a jock itch medicine cream all over my legs,
[52:01.540 --> 52:07.220]  just in agony. We recorded an episode one week and then we recorded a two for the next week.
[52:07.800 --> 52:15.340]  And the entire time I was just like flaming hot jock itch, just in agonizing pain. Anyway,
[52:15.500 --> 52:21.400]  and then eventually they said it would go away. It went away. And when I got the prescription
[52:21.400 --> 52:28.820]  from the... that's the worst Cheetos flavor, Nick said. Flaming hot jock itch. When I got
[52:28.820 --> 52:35.600]  the prescription from the pharmacy, the pharmacist goes, you're going to need more
[52:35.600 --> 52:38.280]  than this. And I go, what do you mean? He goes, they didn't prescribe you enough. This stuff
[52:38.280 --> 52:43.460]  is persistent. And I was like, OK, pharmacist, whatever. The doctor fucking told me this would
[52:43.460 --> 52:47.340]  be enough. And and I bring that up because, you know, this all got beaten back. And like
[52:47.340 --> 52:53.400]  by mid-July, it was gone. I was totally fine. And guess who woke up with jock itch this morning?
[52:53.400 --> 52:59.860]  Oh, no. It's back and it's actually better than ever. So the trilogy of face episodes where
[52:59.860 --> 53:06.340]  you've got knob out, knob rot is now a quadrilogy. There's now a fourth episode. Is your cock out
[53:06.340 --> 53:12.740]  right now? No, no, I'm wearing shorts. It's not like so bad. I can't wear clothes. But I already
[53:12.740 --> 53:16.500]  had to call in the prescription. As soon as we're done here, I got to go to CVS and get more jock
[53:16.500 --> 53:21.120]  itch stuff. I can't fucking believe it. And I'm going to tell the story because A, Gavin said
[53:21.120 --> 53:26.120]  that it's not too gross to tell. And B, because I want to raise awareness for jock itch. It's a
[53:26.120 --> 53:31.580]  terrible tragedy that befalls upon people all over the world. And it doesn't mean that they're
[53:31.580 --> 53:35.660]  grossy gross people. It may just mean that they like to swim a lot. And it's 110 degrees in Texas
[53:35.660 --> 53:45.460]  all the time. So stop jock itch shaming. I ain't never even heard of it. No, it's a thing. I'm
[53:45.460 --> 53:51.780]  aware of it. It sucks so bad. Knob out, knob rot. This is stuck in my head, Gavin.
[53:53.920 --> 53:59.360]  No, my knob is fine. It's not on my knob. It's just on my thighs and the area around the knob.
[53:59.540 --> 54:04.940]  The worst iteration of Fraggle Rock. Knob rot. The worst, the worst part about this is,
[54:05.480 --> 54:12.280]  is that I got the jock itch three weeks before my vasectomy. And so it cleared up,
[54:12.280 --> 54:17.460]  like it cleared up. I was sweating it because I didn't want to like not be able to get my
[54:17.460 --> 54:22.380]  vasectomy. So it cleared up like the week of the vasectomy. And then I got my vasectomy.
[54:22.660 --> 54:28.940]  So I basically haven't been able to sexually use my stuff in like, oh, it was like over a month
[54:28.940 --> 54:33.900]  because I had like jock itch right into the vasectomy recovery. And then now that I'm
[54:33.900 --> 54:38.860]  finally feeling better, you know, I'm two and a half weeks past the vasectomy, the jock itch just
[54:38.860 --> 54:49.640]  like, like, hello? I'm back. The second it clears up, that's straight in there with a scalpel.
[54:49.680 --> 54:56.040]  I'm going to have like three months of an unusable crotch. It just sucks.
[54:58.800 --> 55:03.680]  Just fucking sucks. How do I avoid it? I'm worried about this. Yeah. I don't know,
[55:04.060 --> 55:07.960]  I don't know. You use gold bond powder, right? Like powdering the walls all the time.
[55:08.800 --> 55:13.500]  Talcum powder. Although does that give you cancer or some shit? Oh, does it? Yeah, I think so. I
[55:13.500 --> 55:16.720]  think there's like... what doesn't... what does gold... what gives you cancer?
[55:20.390 --> 55:23.130]  Talcum powder and cancer. Yeah. See, it's rough.
[55:25.570 --> 55:28.790]  Knob rot feels like a thing you'd have to pull out of the operation,
[55:28.930 --> 55:34.650]  guy. It's the knob rot section. We can make a face operation.
[55:36.330 --> 55:38.330]  Knob rot at his bad ankle.
[55:43.020 --> 55:48.680]  You gotta reconnect Andrew's tendon in his ankle. Oh, man. Big long back.
[55:50.020 --> 55:55.100]  Right. Oh, yeah. The mouth is just like... you go near the face and the mouth just lights up.
[55:56.200 --> 56:01.640]  I mean, we all... everyone here has lower body problems. Gavin's got cursed socks. I got unusable
[56:01.640 --> 56:05.560]  ankles. You got the crotch... crotch rot. Yeah. I don't know how you expect... are you going to
[56:05.560 --> 56:09.100]  be able to do this end cap challenge with... Yeah, absolutely. No, I'm good. I'm all good now.
[56:09.480 --> 56:15.180]  And the marathon? That is like a distant thought. I'm just... we gotta, as Geoff said,
[56:15.280 --> 56:21.080]  crawl before we run. Right. That was our point when you brought it up in the first place.
[56:21.540 --> 56:25.000]  You were so far from the marathon when it came out of your mouth. It was. Yeah,
[56:25.040 --> 56:31.140]  you're right. That was a burger confidence moment. Remove a shampoo bottle from the butt.
[56:34.640 --> 56:40.220]  Open up Gavin's airway so he doesn't fart to death in his sleep. I like the idea of having
[56:40.220 --> 56:43.960]  to remove the shampoo bottle from the butt, but every game ships without that piece,
[56:44.060 --> 56:51.220]  like it was never in the butt. This is the empty slot. You fix your farting, Gavin?
[56:52.060 --> 56:56.960]  You still have fart problems? The CPAP is unplugged in a corner still. I can't bring myself to...
[56:57.880 --> 57:02.740]  I want to wait until I've had some decent sleep before I start ruining my sleep. That's my plan.
[57:03.340 --> 57:07.380]  How are you ever going to get decent sleep unless you figure out this CPAP problem?
[57:08.020 --> 57:12.820]  It is a double-edged sword. Didn't you start the CPAP because you couldn't get a good night's sleep?
[57:13.240 --> 57:15.080]  Yeah, that is very sick. Yep.
[57:19.180 --> 57:21.660]  Good app. You ever wake your... oh, we're gonna end. Never mind.
[57:22.160 --> 57:25.740]  I said good app, that wasn't my story. Yeah, wrap up. Yeah, we're done.
[57:25.740 --> 57:29.760]  You got more stuff? Oh, it's a small thing, but it's fine. We should wrap up. This is a good app.
[57:29.760 --> 57:33.260]  I feel like you just destroyed the end of the podcast. We haven't quite hit an hour. Why don't
[57:33.260 --> 57:36.540]  you redeem it with your small thing? No, it's just a small... I was gonna... because we brought
[57:36.540 --> 57:41.060]  it before. Geoff, you woke up on shitting, and I was like, oh, that's a terrible way to come out of
[57:41.060 --> 57:47.520]  sleep. You ever woken yourself up from farting in relation to what Gavin said? Oh, yeah. I don't
[57:47.520 --> 57:53.320]  think I've ever had it happen until like last week. I woke my... I startled myself because I farted.
[57:53.320 --> 57:58.160]  It wasn't loud. It was just powerful. I think it was the most powerful fart I've ever had.
[57:58.760 --> 58:02.840]  Powerful how? Like if it wasn't loud, how was it powerful? Like you moved the other way?
[58:03.300 --> 58:08.200]  Yeah, no, like the sheet moved. Like if we... if there was a baseball between my legs,
[58:08.340 --> 58:11.020]  that ball would have went 80. We would have hit Geoff's goal. It was powerful.
[58:11.020 --> 58:15.680]  How far would a shampoo bottle have gone? Oh, a different country. Easily. It would have
[58:15.680 --> 58:20.920]  went north all the way to Texas. Hands down. Easily. So it was like a lot of pressure.
[58:20.920 --> 58:25.580]  I think it was more like a bassy fart than a loud one. We're at the point now
[58:25.580 --> 58:30.480]  where we can communicate almost entirely in bass references. It's a language.
[58:33.960 --> 58:37.260]  It was just startling. So I was curious if you guys have had it happen to you. It was
[58:37.260 --> 58:41.440]  an alarming thing. I was in a great sleep and then all of a sudden my ass essentially exploded.
[58:42.340 --> 58:47.100]  No, I think I've woken up with the full feeling of needing to, but I don't think I've... I don't
[58:47.100 --> 58:50.460]  think I've actually woken myself up with one. Yeah, I was curious because I knew you were
[58:50.460 --> 58:55.220]  CPAP problems and then you're bloated. I was curious if it ever happened, if that's how you
[58:55.220 --> 59:00.900]  woke up. That'd be fucking awesome. Especially if it was like one of those 45 second CPAP farts,
[59:00.960 --> 59:06.160]  like you wake up in the fart and then you're still farting and then you fully come to and
[59:06.160 --> 59:13.820]  you're still farting. You can just hear him going further away because it's so constant.
[59:15.040 --> 59:17.060]  Slowly, slowly going.
[59:20.140 --> 59:26.280]  Oh, well, you've done it again, audience. You made it to the end of an episode of the
[59:26.280 --> 59:32.660]  F*** Face podcast. Good on you. You're a patient human being. Thanks for listening. Maybe you
[59:32.660 --> 59:38.160]  liked it. I sure hope you did. If you did, I'll assume you're telling everybody you've ever met.
[59:38.160 --> 59:43.580]  Uh, literally every single human being you come in contact with on the planet Earth,
[59:44.040 --> 59:47.940]  you probably are mentioning F*** Face too. And I appreciate that to you. And I'd like to say, hey,
[59:48.780 --> 59:52.880]  uh, that's the bare minimum you could be doing to promote this show. You could try a little harder.
[59:53.520 --> 59:58.740]  Uh, no, I'm just kidding. Don't tell anybody about it. Uh, it doesn't matter either way.
[59:59.100 --> 01:00:02.140]  Uh, we'll listen to you next time. How does it not matter either way?
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:06.860]  Well, I just felt like I was coming on too strong. So then I tried to walk it back a bit. I really
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:11.320]  do want them to tell every single human being on Earth. There are seven and a half billion people
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:15.320]  on this planet and most of them don't listen to our podcast. And I think there's an issue,
[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:20.260]  but I don't want to put the onus too much on the audience because then they're going to feel like
[01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:23.700]  I'm asking too much of them. And I don't want to do that. So, so I tried to like, I realized that
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:27.980]  I thought I overstepped. So then I tried to come back. You're good. We can end this. This is
[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:34.360]  perfect. Gavin, don't unravel us. Okay. Bye. You're unraveling it. What do you mean? I unraveled it.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.440]  It was going great. We had a great ending.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:43.900]  Is it over now? Goodbye. Stop talking. Goodbye. You did that Gavin. That's your fault.
[01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:50.380]  That was Gavin. That was me. Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:56.360]  episode of F*** Face. It's the Halo episode of F*** Face. Let's talk about Tyson. Gavin thought
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:02.220]  Billy Zane was in the mummy. Star wipes are the best. Who forgot to roll audio? The Halo challenge
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:07.700]  has been completed. And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil. All that and more on next
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.180]  week's episode of F*** Face.
