[00:15.230 --> 00:18.210]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:18.390 --> 00:22.630]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[00:22.710 --> 00:22.970]  Hello!
[00:24.890 --> 00:25.290]  Okay.
[00:26.130 --> 00:26.750]  I mean...
[00:26.750 --> 00:27.310]  You okay, Gavin?
[00:27.870 --> 00:29.070]  Just said hello. What's wrong with that?
[00:29.330 --> 00:32.050]  I think it was a Discord thing. It like cut out. It was just...
[00:32.050 --> 00:32.110]  Eww!
[00:32.690 --> 00:36.110]  You just made a noise. Discord cut out and you just went...
[00:36.110 --> 00:36.270]  Eww!
[00:39.430 --> 00:40.930]  Oh, I just tried to give a...
[00:40.930 --> 00:45.270]  It was a pretty disjointed hello on our end.
[00:49.110 --> 00:49.570]  Andrew.
[00:50.530 --> 00:50.810]  Hello.
[00:51.530 --> 00:52.270]  How are you doing, buddy?
[00:53.950 --> 00:56.750]  Not the best, but we're making it.
[00:56.830 --> 00:57.130]  We're okay.
[00:57.370 --> 00:58.310]  Why not the best?
[00:58.510 --> 00:59.250]  Do you want to talk about it?
[00:59.330 --> 01:01.730]  Well, this I guess we're going right in, right into things.
[01:01.970 --> 01:04.490]  I mean, with 100% anchor integrity and you're not the best.
[01:04.690 --> 01:05.870]  100%. Yes.
[01:06.370 --> 01:09.690]  I've COVID right now, so that that is complicated.
[01:10.350 --> 01:11.910]  Yeah. So I have COVID.
[01:12.030 --> 01:15.230]  We just did a whole episode of you having COVID and you didn't even tell us?
[01:16.330 --> 01:21.070]  Well, it ties to the grocery aisle thing, and that never really came up.
[01:21.150 --> 01:22.370]  So I waited.
[01:22.590 --> 01:23.210]  It came up.
[01:23.410 --> 01:26.550]  Well, I came up in a way I didn't want to get into because it's a long...
[01:26.550 --> 01:28.370]  We're going into maybe a long story.
[01:28.750 --> 01:29.510]  It didn't come up conveniently.
[01:29.890 --> 01:33.250]  It came up with the last 10 minutes and we need to do two episodes.
[01:33.350 --> 01:36.370]  It didn't make sense for me to unspool what is happening.
[01:36.370 --> 01:39.190]  Yeah, we spent most of the last episode playing Zane or Vosloo.
[01:39.850 --> 01:40.410]  We did.
[01:41.870 --> 01:42.910]  Which is a great game.
[01:43.110 --> 01:44.430]  Did you get COVID at an in-cab?
[01:46.410 --> 01:47.570]  No, no, I did not.
[01:47.730 --> 01:49.250]  I have not. That did not begin.
[01:50.390 --> 01:52.150]  So I'm in a position to do this.
[01:52.250 --> 01:53.830]  I haven't done it, obviously, because I have COVID.
[01:53.970 --> 01:54.470]  It's that complicated.
[01:54.610 --> 01:55.750]  I can't just go to the store.
[01:55.830 --> 01:57.510]  I've been quarantining,
[01:58.450 --> 02:00.110]  but I was talking because I'm sick.
[02:00.170 --> 02:01.650]  I'm like talking to my mom all the time.
[02:01.690 --> 02:02.790]  She's calling me constantly.
[02:02.790 --> 02:05.990]  And I talked to her about the in-cab thing.
[02:06.030 --> 02:07.630]  I was like, yeah, I can't do the in-cab thing.
[02:07.630 --> 02:09.410]  And she was all about it.
[02:09.810 --> 02:12.110]  She is all into this in-cab idea.
[02:12.290 --> 02:13.410]  She thought it was so funny.
[02:13.710 --> 02:14.830]  She's like, well, I'll do this.
[02:15.030 --> 02:20.170]  I can get stuff from the in-cab for you and I'll just drop these groceries off.
[02:20.230 --> 02:21.430]  And I was like, you don't need to do that.
[02:21.450 --> 02:22.590]  It's fine. It's I'm sick.
[02:22.690 --> 02:24.190]  And we could just do this another time.
[02:24.270 --> 02:25.390]  She said, no, no, you want to do this?
[02:25.430 --> 02:27.030]  You talked about you're going to bring this up on the show.
[02:27.330 --> 02:28.870]  We can do this. This is no problem.
[02:29.210 --> 02:30.730]  I will go to the grocery store.
[02:31.130 --> 02:34.290]  I will take photos of the in-cabs
[02:34.290 --> 02:38.570]  and then you can let me know what you want on the in-cabs.
[02:38.730 --> 02:39.690]  And I said, this is great.
[02:40.030 --> 02:41.310]  Your mother is awesome.
[02:41.650 --> 02:43.270]  She's the anti salad cream.
[02:43.730 --> 02:44.670]  Yeah. No, but no.
[02:44.750 --> 02:49.070]  But my mom, for context, doesn't she is she's got an iPhone six,
[02:49.470 --> 02:51.470]  which is like probably 10 years old at this point.
[02:51.530 --> 02:52.210]  It's very old phone.
[02:52.550 --> 02:53.870]  She doesn't know how to use it.
[02:54.250 --> 02:58.010]  She constantly puts it on silent, silent mode and doesn't know how to reverse it.
[02:58.310 --> 03:01.230]  She is not tech based in any way.
[03:01.310 --> 03:02.810]  She's completely inept when it comes to tech.
[03:02.810 --> 03:06.050]  So it's incredibly sweet that she wants to do this.
[03:06.150 --> 03:10.010]  But I just see a million ways in which this is going to be complicated
[03:10.010 --> 03:13.270]  and not go the way that it was intended to.
[03:13.530 --> 03:15.250]  I said, it's very kind. You don't need to do that.
[03:15.310 --> 03:15.930]  It's very sweet of you.
[03:15.990 --> 03:16.750]  If you want to, you can.
[03:17.310 --> 03:18.470]  She's like, I'm going to do it.
[03:18.510 --> 03:20.470]  It's like, OK, I've been waiting.
[03:20.950 --> 03:22.070]  Waited earlier in the day.
[03:22.450 --> 03:24.510]  She texted me. I'm at the grocery store.
[03:24.890 --> 03:28.990]  Then there was like a 30 or 40 minute break for anything.
[03:29.130 --> 03:32.070]  And I thought, what is what is going on?
[03:32.950 --> 03:37.110]  She then she calls me and she said, Andrew, I took all the photos.
[03:37.550 --> 03:38.950]  I'm trying to text you.
[03:39.090 --> 03:40.930]  I took 67 photos.
[03:41.330 --> 03:44.510]  I'm trying. I'm trying to send them to you all at once.
[03:44.570 --> 03:45.750]  And it will not go through.
[03:46.090 --> 03:47.510]  What do you want to do about this?
[03:47.750 --> 03:51.510]  Do you want me to just tell you what's in all the end caps one by one?
[03:51.770 --> 03:53.110]  And then we could add it.
[03:53.330 --> 03:54.170]  I'm like, no, it's fine.
[03:54.250 --> 03:58.370]  Just just relax, like maybe sit in your car and you can just send me
[03:58.370 --> 04:00.290]  some of the photos in chunks if you want to.
[04:00.370 --> 04:02.070]  Or we could just scrap this idea entirely.
[04:02.070 --> 04:03.070]  We do this later.
[04:03.150 --> 04:03.850]  She's like, no, it's fine.
[04:03.990 --> 04:05.850]  I'll send them in caps.
[04:06.350 --> 04:11.650]  So I got I was getting them in like blocks of 10, but it was 67 photos.
[04:13.030 --> 04:16.650]  And I'm not in no way going to make fun or attack my mom.
[04:16.690 --> 04:18.230]  But it was Geoff level quality.
[04:18.330 --> 04:22.810]  Some of these some of these pictures, the decisions, some of the choices.
[04:23.010 --> 04:24.290]  I'll post. Yeah.
[04:24.330 --> 04:25.410]  Do you have any to show them?
[04:25.950 --> 04:27.270]  I can't wait. I'll take those.
[04:27.350 --> 04:28.110]  A couple of them, by the way.
[04:28.170 --> 04:29.130]  Let me show.
[04:29.490 --> 04:31.590]  I mean, he made Don Zimmer wink.
[04:31.590 --> 04:32.710]  So it's like this.
[04:32.810 --> 04:34.610]  This is one of the sides of the end caps.
[04:34.770 --> 04:36.710]  It's just the left side of it.
[04:36.770 --> 04:39.470]  And it's just it's just Tostitos.
[04:41.050 --> 04:42.330]  It's just that one product.
[04:42.470 --> 04:43.970]  It's a salsa corner.
[04:44.350 --> 04:46.150]  It's like, I'm not going to want salsa.
[04:46.610 --> 04:48.810]  I don't I'm not typically a salsa guy.
[04:49.230 --> 04:52.090]  And on top of the fact of I don't know why you're just taking a photo
[04:52.090 --> 04:53.710]  of just that singular thing.
[04:53.730 --> 04:56.050]  Well, she clearly is thinking about resolution.
[04:56.530 --> 04:58.870]  You know, she thinks maybe you won't be able to see the prices of the names
[04:58.870 --> 04:59.710]  if she's further away.
[04:59.790 --> 05:00.750]  She's going in for details.
[05:00.750 --> 05:01.990]  She is. She went.
[05:02.010 --> 05:02.790]  She went all out.
[05:02.910 --> 05:05.850]  So she took, I think, was 67 photos.
[05:06.750 --> 05:07.570]  We went through it all.
[05:07.710 --> 05:09.450]  I picked I got very lucky.
[05:09.730 --> 05:11.630]  I'm living if there wasn't one.
[05:11.810 --> 05:14.010]  The freezer, you know how there's like a deli section
[05:14.010 --> 05:16.930]  and then at the end of the deli, like a cross from it.
[05:17.310 --> 05:18.230]  There's an end cap.
[05:18.330 --> 05:21.370]  This is a I'm in the wrong section.
[05:21.410 --> 05:21.850]  I'm going to text.
[05:21.990 --> 05:26.490]  There was a section, a little freezer section that had chicken in it.
[05:26.750 --> 05:27.890]  Oh, wow.
[05:27.970 --> 05:29.270]  Just bags of chicken.
[05:29.270 --> 05:31.050]  Oh, I got bags of chicken.
[05:31.170 --> 05:32.210]  So I had that going for me.
[05:32.290 --> 05:33.130]  That was a good one.
[05:33.350 --> 05:36.290]  I'll be honest, there's no evidence whatsoever that that's an end cap.
[05:36.670 --> 05:37.190]  I understand.
[05:37.350 --> 05:38.050]  They're all close.
[05:38.070 --> 05:40.070]  As I said, she's zooming in on us.
[05:41.470 --> 05:42.910]  It's a cereal end cap.
[05:43.150 --> 05:44.150]  That's a pretty good one.
[05:44.250 --> 05:45.390]  That's a lot I can work with there.
[05:45.510 --> 05:47.390]  That gives me some confidence I can make it.
[05:48.590 --> 05:49.310]  What's Vector?
[05:50.170 --> 05:53.370]  Oh, Vector is a Canadian cereal that I loved as a child
[05:53.370 --> 05:54.910]  and I had recently doesn't hold up.
[05:54.970 --> 05:55.990]  I think they changed the recipe.
[05:56.450 --> 05:58.550]  It was supposed to come up in our big cereal conversation.
[05:58.550 --> 06:02.130]  I was lost in European cereal, Gavin.
[06:02.410 --> 06:06.850]  When you're showing the honey monster, Vector does not track.
[06:06.990 --> 06:08.670]  It is not worth mentioning Vector.
[06:08.830 --> 06:09.990]  There's nothing funny about it.
[06:10.050 --> 06:12.230]  It's just athletic cereal.
[06:12.530 --> 06:14.690]  These pictures are so small, by the way.
[06:14.930 --> 06:18.070]  Gavin, you're peeking in in the top right of that photo of all the cereal.
[06:18.610 --> 06:19.630]  You are? Yeah.
[06:20.490 --> 06:22.550]  The little Creeper Crunch in the top right.
[06:23.150 --> 06:24.890]  Is there a cereal called Creeper Crunch?
[06:25.010 --> 06:26.110]  There sure is. Yeah.
[06:26.230 --> 06:27.870]  Wow. That sounds exciting.
[06:27.870 --> 06:29.190]  That makes total sense.
[06:29.450 --> 06:33.870]  It's a thrilling, thrilling row of of that one's mostly a stain.
[06:34.370 --> 06:39.310]  It's mostly a stain floor, but also some Annie's pasta in the bottom,
[06:39.590 --> 06:40.870]  which I think as well.
[06:41.070 --> 06:42.590]  You got the best end caps in the...
[06:42.590 --> 06:44.410]  I think she's misunderstood end caps.
[06:44.850 --> 06:46.230]  No, I went over this with her.
[06:46.330 --> 06:48.130]  I was very clear. I had this argument with her.
[06:48.390 --> 06:50.190]  You got the best store in the world.
[06:50.610 --> 06:51.710]  I think that's an end cap.
[06:51.910 --> 06:53.130]  It looks like an end of an aisle.
[06:53.190 --> 06:55.050]  I agree, Nick, but it's not.
[06:55.210 --> 06:56.250]  It looks like the end of an aisle.
[06:56.810 --> 06:59.430]  Yeah, that looks like she's she's delved in.
[07:00.330 --> 07:03.130]  I don't think that's true, because we were very clear
[07:03.130 --> 07:05.250]  we went back and forth on this and like, do you understand?
[07:05.390 --> 07:07.110]  And she's like, yeah, not in the aisle at all.
[07:07.150 --> 07:09.470]  Just the things on the on the floorboard.
[07:09.930 --> 07:10.650]  Even Eric agrees with me.
[07:11.170 --> 07:12.090]  I agree, too.
[07:12.230 --> 07:15.290]  I looked at that and I said, I don't think that that's an end cap.
[07:15.450 --> 07:18.210]  And we clarified and she argued it was.
[07:18.630 --> 07:22.150]  I can't go to the store to confirm that that's true, but I'll show you.
[07:22.210 --> 07:24.310]  This is what I got for my first first setup.
[07:24.310 --> 07:28.550]  It's not a fun few days of food, but it's certainly livable.
[07:29.210 --> 07:33.190]  I got some ramen, got a few bags of ramen.
[07:33.530 --> 07:36.510]  I got some blueberries, some blackberries.
[07:36.770 --> 07:39.110]  They were in the section with the chicken.
[07:39.590 --> 07:41.610]  I got two chickens to roast.
[07:43.930 --> 07:46.770]  Tostitos lime rounds, which I've never had,
[07:46.830 --> 07:49.330]  but Tostito lime flavored chips are incredible.
[07:49.550 --> 07:50.370]  It's a top tier chip.
[07:50.930 --> 07:54.150]  And there is a little bit of a mix up with the real fruit.
[07:54.150 --> 07:56.990]  I did not want real fruit gummies.
[07:57.310 --> 07:58.830]  There was a shelf.
[08:00.230 --> 08:03.150]  There is a shelf that was real fruit snacks,
[08:03.850 --> 08:10.250]  and she mistook that for a different shelf that featured real fruit gummies.
[08:10.390 --> 08:13.830]  I think I saved the photo of where they were originally.
[08:15.430 --> 08:17.610]  Yeah, how much was this whole?
[08:18.570 --> 08:19.830]  That's a great question.
[08:19.930 --> 08:21.350]  I don't have the answer to that.
[08:21.410 --> 08:22.370]  I should look at the receipt.
[08:22.720 --> 08:24.170]  So how are you going to prepare?
[08:25.330 --> 08:28.170]  So you basically got chicken and fruit.
[08:29.590 --> 08:33.510]  Yeah, this is this was the there's a lot of candy aisles,
[08:33.570 --> 08:38.190]  not including the 30 images of candies and chips of just various aisles.
[08:38.650 --> 08:42.350]  She grabbed the real fruit from the candy section and not the end capped
[08:42.350 --> 08:44.170]  real fruit like fruit snacks.
[08:44.510 --> 08:47.710]  Two different end caps of real.
[08:48.130 --> 08:50.930]  This is their different products and caps.
[08:50.930 --> 08:52.850]  They are different products.
[08:54.950 --> 08:56.550]  They're two different brands, I think.
[08:56.910 --> 08:58.070]  I think maybe they're not.
[08:58.150 --> 08:59.170]  Maybe they're just different variations.
[08:59.430 --> 09:00.130]  I don't know. I haven't looked.
[09:00.290 --> 09:03.610]  I am so fucking excited to go to this grocery store
[09:03.610 --> 09:06.610]  and whenever we go to Canada and see for myself.
[09:08.190 --> 09:08.650]  Well, I'm excited.
[09:08.770 --> 09:11.590]  I will confirm I'll make sure I'll make sure.
[09:11.690 --> 09:14.590]  But I'm pretty confident that everything is end cap valid.
[09:16.230 --> 09:18.870]  Either way, I just I just want to walk through these hallowed halls
[09:18.870 --> 09:19.930]  and see where it all happened.
[09:21.550 --> 09:25.030]  So, yeah, I don't I think maybe I'll do the ramen
[09:25.950 --> 09:28.550]  without seasoning and have it like as a I don't know.
[09:28.790 --> 09:31.110]  But I have two chickens to work with and some fruit.
[09:31.370 --> 09:33.230]  And how long is this lasting you?
[09:34.590 --> 09:37.690]  Well, the anise can easily be a meal itself.
[09:37.690 --> 09:39.430]  So those could be like two meals.
[09:39.530 --> 09:43.810]  The ramen's for this is probably like five days.
[09:43.810 --> 09:45.750]  If I really stretched four days.
[09:46.230 --> 09:48.030]  And how are you? How are you feeling?
[09:48.030 --> 09:50.890]  You are really glossed over the fact that you have COVID right now.
[09:50.950 --> 09:51.910]  Yeah, I don't feel great.
[09:52.190 --> 09:52.990]  I'm tired.
[09:53.610 --> 09:56.470]  It's been like both physically and personal life.
[09:56.530 --> 09:57.670]  Not the best of times.
[09:57.730 --> 10:00.310]  Why didn't you tell us we could have easily moved this recording?
[10:00.690 --> 10:04.510]  Because I don't want to move it because I might I might need to move stuff coming up.
[10:04.610 --> 10:06.250]  So I just wanted I wanted to do this.
[10:06.390 --> 10:08.270]  And it's fun. It's fun to spend time with you guys.
[10:08.630 --> 10:10.010]  It's true. I always have fun.
[10:10.270 --> 10:11.810]  Are you recovering? Are you getting better?
[10:12.430 --> 10:13.930]  Yeah, I'm good. I'm all good.
[10:14.090 --> 10:15.350]  I'm like, it's I'm fine.
[10:15.430 --> 10:16.330]  I'm just exhausted.
[10:16.630 --> 10:17.450]  You're going to make it that.
[10:17.450 --> 10:20.250]  I'm yeah, I'm excited for monkey morning tomorrow.
[10:20.350 --> 10:21.190]  How long have you?
[10:21.730 --> 10:23.270]  No wonder you didn't want to make the PowerPoint.
[10:25.350 --> 10:26.630]  I'm like on day three, day four.
[10:26.910 --> 10:28.210]  OK, but a few days.
[10:28.470 --> 10:30.290]  I have a question about your end cap selection.
[10:30.750 --> 10:35.210]  Of course, you make choices to potentially, you know, this is like one whole.
[10:35.330 --> 10:38.190]  And then if you do another order from the end caps, you'll get different stuff.
[10:38.190 --> 10:40.870]  Or is this pretty much everything that you wanted from the end caps?
[10:41.130 --> 10:44.630]  This is yeah, this is like ideally I'm going to do another
[10:44.630 --> 10:46.710]  another run of it at some other time.
[10:46.710 --> 10:49.890]  That was deliberately not gotten stuff that you may get next time.
[10:50.670 --> 10:53.330]  Yes, I feel like I'm surprised you don't get any cereal.
[10:54.410 --> 10:56.070]  We yeah, I should have done that.
[10:56.130 --> 11:00.130]  I just I've had, as I said last episode, I just went hard on some cinnamon
[11:00.130 --> 11:02.110]  toast crunch over the last few days.
[11:02.590 --> 11:04.410]  It's a cereal just doesn't feel like a thing I'd want to.
[11:04.430 --> 11:05.530]  But it's a killer item.
[11:05.790 --> 11:07.430]  I fucked up. I should have put cereal on the list.
[11:07.630 --> 11:10.110]  I mean, unless there's no milk on the end caps.
[11:10.150 --> 11:11.390]  Oh, I don't drink.
[11:11.510 --> 11:12.330]  There were actually.
[11:12.510 --> 11:14.770]  Oh, fuck. That isn't that is actually there was.
[11:14.930 --> 11:15.890]  I didn't include that.
[11:15.890 --> 11:17.810]  I forgot that in the photos and that's not in the thing.
[11:17.930 --> 11:19.690]  I got milk and a thing of butter.
[11:20.190 --> 11:21.290]  So, huh.
[11:21.650 --> 11:23.150]  That butter on an end cap, too.
[11:23.790 --> 11:25.950]  They wouldn't like the deli section end cap.
[11:26.210 --> 11:28.310]  Yes. What wasn't on the end cap?
[11:28.450 --> 11:29.090]  Yeah, this should be.
[11:29.170 --> 11:29.990]  That should be a feature.
[11:30.130 --> 11:33.270]  That should be all Canadian super supermarkets should just advertise.
[11:33.390 --> 11:34.390]  Come to Canadian supermarkets.
[11:34.450 --> 11:35.910]  All in caps all the time.
[11:36.250 --> 11:37.110]  Never going on an aisle.
[11:37.330 --> 11:37.690]  Find.
[11:38.570 --> 11:39.430]  They're not safe.
[11:39.550 --> 11:40.830]  Yeah, I think I forgot to save them.
[11:40.870 --> 11:41.610]  I'll pull it up right now.
[11:41.730 --> 11:43.350]  It was like a deli.
[11:43.490 --> 11:44.830]  That's where I got the fruit, too.
[11:44.830 --> 11:48.450]  There is really only one end cap that had meaningful food.
[11:48.890 --> 11:50.770]  Outside of that, there it's just snacks.
[11:51.110 --> 11:58.490]  It's mainly rows of chips and salsa and sour patch kids and root beer.
[11:59.990 --> 12:02.410]  It's a disaster as far as doing this.
[12:03.090 --> 12:07.450]  I think it's very store dependent on how viable it is as a challenge.
[12:07.590 --> 12:09.650]  I might try this challenge myself just out of curiosity.
[12:10.070 --> 12:14.070]  I would love to see your results and compare what your end caps are like compared to mine.
[12:14.070 --> 12:16.730]  Yeah, I might try the HEB by the office.
[12:17.150 --> 12:22.750]  Oh, that's a that's a that's a big HEB, a new HEB, a very fancy HEB.
[12:22.910 --> 12:24.790]  They're going to have a lot of end cap options for you there.
[12:25.010 --> 12:26.690]  And I'm going to go wide on my pictures.
[12:27.890 --> 12:29.410]  That's hey, I agree.
[12:29.870 --> 12:31.130]  I was the photographer here.
[12:32.610 --> 12:34.730]  She took Geoff's masterclass, I think.
[12:36.410 --> 12:36.950]  Why am I getting shrapnel?
[12:36.950 --> 12:39.690]  This was the the milk, butter end cap.
[12:39.970 --> 12:40.950]  That was a big one.
[12:41.330 --> 12:42.190]  That's just an aisle.
[12:42.550 --> 12:43.990]  No, it's the the end.
[12:43.990 --> 12:44.610]  What do you mean?
[12:44.650 --> 12:45.930]  It's at the end of the row.
[12:47.010 --> 12:50.190]  I. It's a transitional end cap.
[12:50.510 --> 12:53.910]  I don't want to kick a man when he's got COVID, but these photos.
[12:54.190 --> 12:58.830]  No, each photo, each photo weakens your case, man.
[12:59.030 --> 13:00.010]  I understand.
[13:00.290 --> 13:01.650]  Stop listening to the photos.
[13:02.190 --> 13:03.750]  Listen, I'm not Elvin.
[13:04.210 --> 13:05.130]  I hate to say it.
[13:05.790 --> 13:08.290]  I think your mom has salad creamed it.
[13:09.090 --> 13:10.250]  No, I don't think so.
[13:10.350 --> 13:11.650]  I think we were very clear.
[13:11.850 --> 13:12.470]  I'd be shocked.
[13:13.070 --> 13:16.410]  And, you know, and you guys come here, I can show you this fucking end cap.
[13:16.450 --> 13:18.490]  And I want to I want to be wrong.
[13:18.610 --> 13:19.810]  I want to have so much.
[13:19.970 --> 13:22.250]  I want to I want so much to believe.
[13:22.850 --> 13:23.330]  Proven wrong.
[13:23.670 --> 13:24.530]  We have to go here.
[13:24.730 --> 13:26.370]  I can't wait for you to be proven wrong.
[13:26.770 --> 13:27.670]  I feel like
[13:29.090 --> 13:33.990]  I feel like because it's against a wall or something.
[13:34.230 --> 13:38.670]  He like there's some kind of trickery going on here where it's like, well,
[13:39.950 --> 13:44.430]  technically, this is again, this is the end because it's not an aisle.
[13:44.710 --> 13:46.170]  That's what I think is happening.
[13:46.610 --> 13:48.350]  That's what I'm anticipating here.
[13:49.410 --> 13:50.190]  No, it's not.
[13:50.330 --> 13:54.710]  I think it's if you stood at the front of the store, let's say, like between the aisle.
[13:54.930 --> 13:55.690]  See, this is what I see.
[13:55.810 --> 13:56.430]  This is it.
[13:56.530 --> 13:57.930]  Listen to how it's going already.
[13:58.150 --> 13:59.590]  Listen to how it's going already.
[14:00.770 --> 14:02.470]  This is is that not an end cap?
[14:03.030 --> 14:07.310]  The thing at the end that is part if the to the right is definitively
[14:07.310 --> 14:11.090]  if had chips on it, you'd be like, that's a fucking end cap on the end of it.
[14:11.150 --> 14:12.210]  I'm sure. Yes.
[14:12.790 --> 14:15.390]  It's between the two aisles in the front facing.
[14:15.890 --> 14:17.030]  Wait, between two aisles.
[14:17.350 --> 14:18.170]  Well, you know what I mean?
[14:18.170 --> 14:21.350]  Like when an end cap is always between aisles, it's at the end.
[14:21.730 --> 14:23.170]  It's the front facing end.
[14:23.330 --> 14:25.770]  Now, can you draw a picture and circle what you're talking about?
[14:26.110 --> 14:27.510]  No, we need a diagram.
[14:29.210 --> 14:30.010]  OK, sure.
[14:30.290 --> 14:31.210]  How will I draw this?
[14:31.730 --> 14:34.110]  I don't know how to use a paper and a pencil.
[14:34.770 --> 14:36.610]  How'd you draw the banana you made that time?
[14:36.610 --> 14:38.350]  It was an awesome banana, by the way.
[14:38.410 --> 14:41.050]  So, OK, I got a here.
[14:41.670 --> 14:43.010]  It's just there's too much.
[14:43.050 --> 14:46.370]  There's something going on here that like I just I need to learn.
[14:46.490 --> 14:48.490]  I'm trying to figure out how they've conspired together.
[14:48.750 --> 14:49.710]  Yeah, 100 percent.
[14:49.950 --> 14:50.910]  Because here's the thing.
[14:50.950 --> 14:54.050]  I don't think his mom did it purposefully.
[14:54.490 --> 14:58.090]  Like, I don't think she really went like, I'm going to really get them here.
[14:58.290 --> 15:00.550]  But I do think that it's in their DNA.
[15:01.330 --> 15:02.810]  That is exactly I was going to say.
[15:02.990 --> 15:05.630]  I have salad cream running through my veins.
[15:05.630 --> 15:11.870]  So it is very possible this has occurred, but it's not it's not anyone's fault.
[15:11.990 --> 15:14.390]  So I'm going to draw a line.
[15:14.790 --> 15:16.110]  OK, we got a line.
[15:16.210 --> 15:17.250]  We got a line.
[15:17.430 --> 15:18.450]  That's an aisle right there.
[15:18.870 --> 15:23.670]  I don't understand how he says these things and then says, but it's not my fault.
[15:24.210 --> 15:25.530]  I don't know.
[15:26.030 --> 15:30.170]  He's already diverting to genetics.
[15:30.730 --> 15:35.130]  It's really something like it was just by food
[15:35.130 --> 15:36.890]  that's at the end of an aisle.
[15:38.290 --> 15:41.210]  And it's like against the wall.
[15:41.310 --> 15:44.910]  He's going to draw the whole grocery store and do like magic tricks.
[15:45.250 --> 15:46.790]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[15:46.790 --> 15:48.530]  Let me let me take a photo of this.
[15:50.450 --> 15:51.690]  OK, we got it.
[15:51.750 --> 15:52.470]  We got a line.
[15:53.010 --> 15:55.170]  I love that Andrew's like, what?
[15:55.350 --> 15:57.150]  No. How am I supposed to draw?
[15:59.170 --> 16:00.130]  Geoff, I don't.
[16:00.490 --> 16:02.590]  Geoff, what do you think we're about to see?
[16:02.870 --> 16:04.210]  I'll wait until you answer.
[16:04.790 --> 16:07.250]  Tell you, I'm going to tell you what we're about to see.
[16:07.370 --> 16:09.330]  We're about to see gold.
[16:09.350 --> 16:11.490]  We're about to see absolute gold.
[16:11.730 --> 16:12.630]  No, no, no, no.
[16:12.710 --> 16:16.010]  This is I feel very clearly this is what an end cap is.
[16:16.150 --> 16:18.010]  You have the line going down.
[16:18.330 --> 16:19.330]  That's the aisle.
[16:19.470 --> 16:21.830]  And then two nails standing on there.
[16:22.290 --> 16:23.530]  Two gold tees.
[16:24.290 --> 16:25.890]  What do you want me to draw?
[16:26.650 --> 16:29.390]  You want me to put fucking Lays in the corner?
[16:29.770 --> 16:30.870]  You want some chip bags?
[16:31.230 --> 16:32.370]  It's the laziest.
[16:32.370 --> 16:36.110]  If you tweet that, if you tweet that said, what did I draw?
[16:36.470 --> 16:38.290]  No one would say end caps.
[16:38.770 --> 16:41.690]  They would say upside down golf tees.
[16:42.130 --> 16:44.090]  I will challenge that right fucking now.
[16:44.450 --> 16:48.070]  You'll get a couple of nails and some golf tees and nothing else.
[16:50.670 --> 16:51.670]  How is that not?
[16:51.850 --> 16:53.030]  How would you draw it?
[16:53.110 --> 16:54.830]  That's the lines or the aisles.
[16:55.210 --> 16:58.530]  There's two spaces between that you walk in the middle of
[16:58.530 --> 17:01.410]  and the end caps go before the lines.
[17:02.370 --> 17:04.410]  You can't go into any of the line part.
[17:04.570 --> 17:06.530]  You can't cross the end cap line.
[17:07.150 --> 17:10.330]  That's the that's top line tea towel level of effort.
[17:11.070 --> 17:12.470]  Well, what do you want?
[17:12.530 --> 17:13.810]  I don't fucking draw.
[17:13.990 --> 17:15.310]  I don't understand the criticism.
[17:15.450 --> 17:16.050]  What would you do?
[17:16.230 --> 17:17.050]  You draw it, Gavin.
[17:17.210 --> 17:18.050]  I want to see yours.
[17:19.410 --> 17:20.930]  Show me how you do it.
[17:22.570 --> 17:23.850]  I'm not ready with a paper.
[17:23.930 --> 17:24.370]  All right. Hold on.
[17:24.430 --> 17:25.750]  Oh, I wasn't ready either.
[17:26.050 --> 17:26.950]  You think I was ready?
[17:27.470 --> 17:28.970]  I asked, how do you draw?
[17:29.250 --> 17:30.410]  That's how unready I was.
[17:31.870 --> 17:32.950]  What did I draw?
[17:33.070 --> 17:33.730]  Is that all I'm saying?
[17:34.210 --> 17:34.470]  Yeah.
[17:34.990 --> 17:35.310]  Okay.
[17:35.830 --> 17:36.730]  What did I draw?
[17:37.190 --> 17:38.050]  Find out. We'll see.
[17:38.690 --> 17:38.970]  End cap.
[17:39.290 --> 17:40.370]  End cap will be quick.
[17:40.790 --> 17:42.190]  How would you make adjustments to it?
[17:42.570 --> 17:43.130]  I'm drawing.
[17:43.630 --> 17:43.990]  Okay.
[17:44.990 --> 17:46.290]  Geoff, are you drawing an end cap?
[17:46.410 --> 17:47.190]  I'm drawing, yeah.
[17:47.670 --> 17:47.930]  Okay.
[17:48.890 --> 17:51.990]  You're gonna have a fucking triangle with a nose at the top of yours.
[17:52.210 --> 17:53.190]  I've seen your drawings.
[17:53.690 --> 17:55.850]  I mean, for Geoff, it's not really about what he draws.
[17:55.950 --> 17:57.630]  It's about the picture that we get of it.
[17:57.630 --> 18:00.270]  If it's gonna be able to be, like, really visible.
[18:01.030 --> 18:03.570]  The first reply was, Flamingo legs.
[18:05.410 --> 18:06.830]  Wow, that was fast.
[18:07.230 --> 18:08.190]  Two plungers.
[18:08.850 --> 18:10.570]  A lot of two plungers.
[18:10.830 --> 18:11.990]  I mean, nobody.
[18:12.310 --> 18:13.450]  This is just gonna be...
[18:13.450 --> 18:14.470]  Chicken legs.
[18:14.730 --> 18:16.110]  You really, like...
[18:17.190 --> 18:18.510]  You fucked yourself.
[18:18.890 --> 18:19.790]  What a bad idea.
[18:20.230 --> 18:21.690]  What a bad idea it was.
[18:22.230 --> 18:23.310]  What a bad idea.
[18:23.590 --> 18:25.150]  I literally have no idea.
[18:25.310 --> 18:26.510]  I guess candlesticks?
[18:26.510 --> 18:29.930]  What did I draw is what you wrote?
[18:30.150 --> 18:30.870]  That's incredible.
[18:31.670 --> 18:32.490]  No one...
[18:32.490 --> 18:37.010]  I'm looking at 15 replies, and no one has guessed what you draw.
[18:37.510 --> 18:39.130]  Like, this is insane.
[18:40.150 --> 18:42.430]  Yeah, you really did yourself in, bud.
[18:43.190 --> 18:46.130]  I feel like I accurately, with context...
[18:46.130 --> 18:47.030]  Thank you, Geoff.
[18:47.150 --> 18:48.190]  Oh, fucking...
[18:48.190 --> 18:49.810]  Look at you show off over here.
[18:50.070 --> 18:51.670]  You got fucking so many lines.
[18:52.250 --> 18:53.250]  So many aisles.
[18:53.690 --> 18:54.870]  I think it speaks for itself.
[18:55.590 --> 18:58.530]  At the front, you have three checkout counters with three checkout people.
[18:59.070 --> 19:03.490]  Then you have three long rows, and you can see I drew arrows to the things that you can eat.
[19:04.050 --> 19:05.230]  It says, stuff to eat.
[19:05.610 --> 19:08.150]  And then at the back, it says, stuff to eat, next to the meat counter.
[19:08.570 --> 19:10.510]  And then in the middle, it says, off-limits!
[19:10.830 --> 19:12.270]  Because you're not allowed to eat any of that stuff.
[19:12.930 --> 19:13.830]  I feel like that's pretty solid.
[19:14.070 --> 19:15.530]  I see a lot of wasted lines.
[19:15.870 --> 19:19.290]  If I'm gonna be critical of this, I see a lot of unnecessary information.
[19:19.670 --> 19:21.110]  You're creating a lore...
[19:21.110 --> 19:23.870]  I think if you tweeted this image and said, what did I draw?
[19:23.870 --> 19:25.730]  Everyone would say, grocery store.
[19:25.730 --> 19:26.850]  That's a different argument.
[19:27.950 --> 19:33.370]  That's not what I... this didn't come into, I'm gonna tweet a thing that I drew and see how many people get it right.
[19:33.490 --> 19:34.370]  Like, that wasn't the goal.
[19:34.490 --> 19:37.810]  It was contextually within this conversation of what an end cap is.
[19:38.130 --> 19:39.230]  I just... it's the minimal.
[19:39.690 --> 19:44.030]  I did a minimal, but clear, where the end cap zone is.
[19:44.210 --> 19:46.110]  Definitely minimal, Andrew. Yeah.
[19:46.250 --> 19:47.150]  It was. Yeah.
[19:47.410 --> 19:49.510]  Why am I going all out? We all know what an end cap is.
[19:50.370 --> 19:51.870]  Andrew's art is like jazz.
[19:51.870 --> 19:53.250]  It's what he didn't draw.
[19:54.250 --> 19:55.390]  Oh my god.
[19:56.430 --> 19:57.590]  You're taking a while, Gavin.
[19:59.110 --> 20:00.350]  Microsoft Paint crashed.
[20:00.930 --> 20:01.450]  Oh, I see.
[20:01.850 --> 20:07.250]  I thought you were adding a teller and giving them a name and a whole fucking backstory to show how great...
[20:07.250 --> 20:08.850]  Yeah, they work here part time.
[20:09.170 --> 20:09.790]  This is Phoebe.
[20:10.630 --> 20:14.130]  She's been working here for six months while she's saving up to go back to school.
[20:17.870 --> 20:20.390]  Oh, Gavin's is a different take, but very good.
[20:20.390 --> 20:22.950]  The stars are the end cap.
[20:23.750 --> 20:26.710]  Should I just call my mom? Should I ask what an end cap is?
[20:27.010 --> 20:28.630]  Get her to draw an end cap.
[20:30.590 --> 20:32.570]  Take a photo of it, but very close up.
[20:33.090 --> 20:34.070]  I'll get her to draw an end cap.
[20:34.390 --> 20:35.110]  I like your people.
[20:35.510 --> 20:38.350]  Is that... are those people any of us, Gavin? Or...
[20:38.350 --> 20:39.310]  Yeah, that's you and me.
[20:39.550 --> 20:41.270]  And we're shopping on opposite aisles.
[20:41.870 --> 20:44.270]  That's the area available to you for shopping.
[20:44.730 --> 20:44.910]  Yeah.
[20:46.150 --> 20:47.770]  No, that goes into the aisle.
[20:48.150 --> 20:49.870]  That's a fuck drawing. What are you talking about?
[20:49.870 --> 20:50.670]  What do you mean?
[20:50.730 --> 20:50.910]  What?
[20:51.710 --> 20:53.790]  The line, the star line above the stars.
[20:53.950 --> 20:55.070]  You're in the aisle at that point.
[20:55.610 --> 20:56.750]  Above the stars.
[20:57.290 --> 20:58.970]  Unless that's a blank space.
[20:59.150 --> 20:59.790]  OK, never mind.
[20:59.870 --> 21:01.070]  That's between two shelves.
[21:01.350 --> 21:02.810]  I get it, I get it, I understand.
[21:03.150 --> 21:04.550]  I understand. I thought it was a row.
[21:04.710 --> 21:05.350]  I thought it was a row.
[21:05.710 --> 21:07.830]  I misread. I misread what you're talking about.
[21:07.830 --> 21:09.190]  Yeah, there's no people in there. That's why.
[21:09.350 --> 21:10.470]  I just thought it was an empty row.
[21:10.890 --> 21:12.370]  No, I should have, like, blanked it out.
[21:12.710 --> 21:13.110]  It's OK.
[21:13.570 --> 21:15.550]  I mean, that does not exist in a grocery store.
[21:15.770 --> 21:16.150]  That's nice.
[21:17.290 --> 21:18.790]  Well, it's just the top of the shelf.
[21:19.310 --> 21:20.850]  I understand. It's not that it's not.
[21:20.970 --> 21:21.930]  It's not that spaced out.
[21:22.150 --> 21:24.370]  That's the same size as your rows.
[21:25.630 --> 21:26.990]  It's a little smaller.
[21:27.050 --> 21:28.110]  I'm sick, OK?
[21:28.390 --> 21:29.390]  And I'm doing this bit.
[21:29.810 --> 21:31.010]  I'm making it work.
[21:31.250 --> 21:32.330]  You're doing a great job.
[21:32.410 --> 21:33.750]  You're doing a great job, buddy.
[21:33.870 --> 21:35.830]  Honestly, it's way better than what I expected.
[21:36.170 --> 21:40.130]  I just I didn't realize I was going to get called out for the next time
[21:40.130 --> 21:41.310]  you asked me to draw something.
[21:41.470 --> 21:42.610]  Oh, there's going to be complexity.
[21:42.870 --> 21:43.910]  And I do not want to hear it.
[21:44.150 --> 21:46.230]  You drew one of the best bananas I've ever seen.
[21:46.510 --> 21:47.670]  Last time we actually draw something.
[21:48.190 --> 21:49.130]  It is a great banana.
[21:49.230 --> 21:50.610]  We were just expecting that quality.
[21:51.310 --> 21:53.310]  Emily's insult of my drawing was so funny.
[21:53.390 --> 21:54.190]  What was it was like?
[21:54.630 --> 21:55.370]  What did she say?
[21:55.410 --> 21:57.750]  She said that I draw like an innocent child.
[21:58.110 --> 21:59.050]  I think that's what she said.
[21:59.210 --> 21:59.870]  It was so funny.
[22:00.090 --> 22:01.910]  I don't remember the exact wording, but it was perfect.
[22:02.110 --> 22:03.270]  It's a great descriptor.
[22:04.250 --> 22:07.750]  Yeah. Well, you definitely you definitely draw golf
[22:09.470 --> 22:11.170]  nails and golf tees like an innocent child.
[22:11.650 --> 22:14.890]  Oh, well, what are some of the other responses to your tweet?
[22:14.990 --> 22:16.730]  Oh, let me let me open it back up.
[22:16.730 --> 22:18.710]  I closed it at Flamingo legs.
[22:19.270 --> 22:20.070]  Thanks, Gavin.
[22:20.550 --> 22:21.650]  Just, you know, for clarity.
[22:21.850 --> 22:23.110]  Gavin. Yeah, that's now.
[22:23.230 --> 22:24.430]  You know what? I would have no questions.
[22:24.870 --> 22:26.230]  That's where they store all their grown tubes.
[22:26.490 --> 22:29.770]  There are 52 replies and none of them have guessed right.
[22:30.510 --> 22:33.030]  Traffic cones, big bird legs.
[22:33.710 --> 22:36.250]  The pull chains for a ceiling fan.
[22:40.330 --> 22:44.730]  I think the color choice is really turning people's opinions.
[22:45.470 --> 22:46.670]  Yeah, I couldn't find a pen.
[22:47.370 --> 22:48.510]  That's just all I had.
[22:49.110 --> 22:53.030]  Well, I'll use like a felt thing, an art brush.
[22:53.370 --> 22:54.270]  What did I use?
[22:56.790 --> 22:58.890]  Pit artist, pawn brush.
[22:59.430 --> 23:01.790]  I'm mainly annoyed that we're not annoyed.
[23:01.890 --> 23:04.750]  I'm disappointed that your photo doesn't show anything about your life
[23:04.750 --> 23:05.910]  other than the picture.
[23:06.050 --> 23:08.510]  I usually there's a glimpse of, oh, yeah, on the side.
[23:08.570 --> 23:10.350]  But this is completely your drawing.
[23:11.470 --> 23:15.450]  Yeah, we usually get a little unintended, Andrew, but not it is.
[23:15.450 --> 23:19.630]  I don't know if I drew it on the instructions
[23:20.210 --> 23:23.550]  for an electric s'mores maker that I received recently.
[23:23.730 --> 23:25.670]  That is next to me.
[23:25.970 --> 23:28.450]  So I just need like a candle or like a little flame.
[23:28.550 --> 23:32.330]  I remember before I was melting the marshmallows with the candle
[23:32.330 --> 23:35.850]  and I was told that that is a terrible idea, that you're essentially eating wax.
[23:36.130 --> 23:40.230]  Yeah. So for my birthday, I was given an electric s'mores maker.
[23:40.830 --> 23:42.810]  What is it? It's just like a heat gun or like what?
[23:43.050 --> 23:43.490]  What's going on?
[23:43.490 --> 23:46.770]  It's yeah, it's just like a what's the that?
[23:47.250 --> 23:51.570]  That's what it is. Oh, it's got like a heat spool inside.
[23:51.950 --> 23:53.050]  You flip the switch.
[23:53.330 --> 23:56.950]  Is that just like a DeWalt heat gun with the s'mores holder?
[23:57.970 --> 24:01.330]  Sort of. Does the does the chocolate not melt
[24:01.330 --> 24:03.970]  just being in proximity of the the heat gun?
[24:04.270 --> 24:05.450]  I it might. I don't know.
[24:05.610 --> 24:07.310]  I've never had it with chocolate or anything.
[24:07.450 --> 24:09.850]  I have toasted some marshmallows. It works great.
[24:10.130 --> 24:10.770]  It's a great product.
[24:10.770 --> 24:12.130]  I like that it's 360.
[24:12.390 --> 24:14.430]  Like you have access to every side. Oh, you have full turns.
[24:14.530 --> 24:17.030]  Yeah. Yeah, it's perfect. I would try that.
[24:17.130 --> 24:19.490]  Is that is that electric? Oh, what do you mean by that?
[24:19.570 --> 24:21.370]  Do you plug it in and use electricity or is it?
[24:21.510 --> 24:23.170]  Well, it has an on button. Yeah.
[24:23.310 --> 24:25.170]  Oh, yeah, it does. Yeah, you plug.
[24:25.230 --> 24:26.350]  I just didn't see the on button. Sorry.
[24:26.830 --> 24:27.550]  That's why it's confused.
[24:28.070 --> 24:28.990]  Oh, it's great. Yeah.
[24:29.030 --> 24:29.610]  What have you made?
[24:29.750 --> 24:32.150]  What what thing shouldn't you have made with it that you made?
[24:32.330 --> 24:34.650]  I wondered if I could. No, I haven't done ramen.
[24:34.770 --> 24:36.230]  I have considered toast.
[24:37.110 --> 24:38.630]  I think it could work with toast.
[24:38.630 --> 24:41.930]  I have had those thoughts of what could I do with this?
[24:42.030 --> 24:45.790]  I wondered if I could if I could like heat up hash browns, maybe with it.
[24:46.150 --> 24:46.810]  It'd be tough.
[24:47.190 --> 24:48.950]  You know what? A pan on top.
[24:49.210 --> 24:50.290]  I bet you could do.
[24:50.990 --> 24:54.210]  You've got those real fruit plant based
[24:55.550 --> 24:57.190]  medley melange gummies.
[24:57.450 --> 24:59.950]  I'm looking at I bet you could melt all those down
[24:59.950 --> 25:03.810]  and then form them into one giant gummy in the shape of your choosing.
[25:04.210 --> 25:07.890]  I bet you could have a gummy infused s'more.
[25:07.890 --> 25:09.110]  Oh, that sounds terrible.
[25:09.150 --> 25:10.890]  I know. I don't want that.
[25:11.030 --> 25:12.330]  You could definitely do that.
[25:13.270 --> 25:17.510]  Yeah. Between the marshmallow and the choccy, a nice slab of gummies.
[25:18.310 --> 25:19.390]  No, no, thanks.
[25:20.010 --> 25:21.130]  I like the meltdown idea.
[25:21.490 --> 25:22.790]  That's you're going somewhere with that.
[25:23.030 --> 25:23.830]  I'm going to think about that.
[25:24.090 --> 25:27.330]  You know how sometimes when you have gum or like a candy and you squeeze it
[25:27.330 --> 25:30.430]  and then there's like a like a burst of flavor from the middle
[25:30.430 --> 25:33.530]  that's like some sort of a jelly or whatever, you could
[25:34.230 --> 25:37.050]  you could invent a new product.
[25:37.050 --> 25:40.830]  That people get into like s'mores, where you cut a hole
[25:40.830 --> 25:45.950]  like a little slit in in a marshmallow and then you stuff the gummy in there
[25:45.950 --> 25:46.990]  and then let it close back up.
[25:47.070 --> 25:49.250]  And then when you heat that, then when you eat it, you get a little
[25:49.250 --> 25:51.910]  a little melted gummy surprise.
[25:52.750 --> 25:56.210]  Hmm. That hey, it's not a I've heard worse ideas.
[25:56.870 --> 25:59.930]  If you could really draw for me what you're thinking, I'd appreciate that
[25:59.930 --> 26:01.750]  in great detail to really that'll sell me.
[26:02.010 --> 26:05.430]  I'm not going to do that, but I don't think that one needs it.
[26:05.710 --> 26:06.530]  You know what? No, I will.
[26:06.530 --> 26:07.970]  I don't think any of them needed it.
[26:08.790 --> 26:10.030]  A lot of big bird likes.
[26:11.050 --> 26:11.930]  Someone will get it.
[26:12.730 --> 26:13.710]  No one will get it.
[26:14.150 --> 26:15.390]  Someone eventually will get it.
[26:15.670 --> 26:18.230]  I think contextually, you know what it was, though.
[26:18.670 --> 26:20.670]  Within the context of the conversation, we're happening.
[26:20.750 --> 26:21.230]  It made sense.
[26:22.030 --> 26:23.390]  I'm excited to see.
[26:24.010 --> 26:25.110]  I'm excited. What are you doing?
[26:25.190 --> 26:26.170]  Are you actually drawing something?
[26:26.650 --> 26:27.530]  You asked me to draw it.
[26:27.970 --> 26:29.170]  I was just being silly.
[26:30.030 --> 26:30.590]  I draw stuff.
[26:31.030 --> 26:31.830]  It was not a hard one.
[26:33.210 --> 26:35.550]  What does it say on your drawing that Geoff stuff?
[26:37.130 --> 26:38.150]  Stuff to pot.
[26:38.990 --> 26:41.890]  All of the drawings will be on Instagram, by the way.
[26:41.910 --> 26:42.950]  Yeah, of course. We'd like to eat.
[26:43.230 --> 26:45.050]  That's the area that's safe for him to eat stuff.
[26:48.930 --> 26:50.050]  Boom. There you go.
[26:52.030 --> 26:52.530]  That's good.
[26:53.030 --> 26:54.610]  Got me, Marshall. Yeah, that works.
[26:55.390 --> 26:56.490]  I think that's the science.
[26:56.970 --> 26:59.030]  I think it's going to a nominee.
[26:59.430 --> 27:00.970]  I imagine I apologize for that.
[27:02.370 --> 27:03.690]  I can I can redo that.
[27:04.370 --> 27:05.830]  I'm excited for the updated picture.
[27:08.730 --> 27:10.110]  I'll let you know how the chickens go.
[27:10.350 --> 27:10.950]  How are you going to cook them?
[27:11.910 --> 27:13.330]  Probably oven. Just in the oven.
[27:13.490 --> 27:13.910]  Seed them up.
[27:14.490 --> 27:15.730]  Throw some salt, pepper on it.
[27:15.750 --> 27:16.250]  Maybe. I don't know.
[27:16.430 --> 27:17.590]  I guess I can't. Fuck.
[27:18.370 --> 27:19.390]  I can't season. Yeah.
[27:20.090 --> 27:21.470]  I can't see that.
[27:22.050 --> 27:22.570]  That's the problem.
[27:22.950 --> 27:24.110]  You didn't buy any drink.
[27:24.530 --> 27:26.430]  Well, I assume that I could just have water.
[27:26.550 --> 27:29.890]  I don't pay for like a most of I drink water a lot of the time.
[27:30.150 --> 27:30.550]  That's fair.
[27:30.930 --> 27:31.770]  I didn't consider that.
[27:31.830 --> 27:32.890]  I think I would need a drink.
[27:33.010 --> 27:36.350]  I just don't want to, you know, getting Pepsi's out of the fridge or whatever.
[27:37.390 --> 27:38.930]  Oh, how long do you have to do this for?
[27:39.450 --> 27:40.650]  I think it was a week, right?
[27:41.010 --> 27:42.770]  So yeah, starting today.
[27:44.110 --> 27:46.350]  Or tomorrow, depending on if I cook the chickens.
[27:46.590 --> 27:47.370]  Oh, let's start today.
[27:48.270 --> 27:49.290]  Update the photo for you.
[27:49.570 --> 27:51.230]  That's right. You didn't just change the E to an A.
[27:52.010 --> 27:53.770]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[27:53.930 --> 27:54.890]  I'm not trying to hide it.
[27:55.550 --> 27:58.050]  I also like that it's on the back of your other drawing.
[27:58.630 --> 27:59.610]  It is. It is.
[27:59.690 --> 28:00.790]  It is on the back of saving.
[28:01.010 --> 28:03.430]  Put it in the face museum.
[28:03.910 --> 28:04.750]  We got more art.
[28:08.090 --> 28:12.690]  I appreciate the vote of my abilities, but I don't know that it's worthy of the museum.
[28:13.590 --> 28:14.970]  Andrew, what have you got for the museum?
[28:15.090 --> 28:17.210]  Have you got any of the stuff you've destroyed or ruined?
[28:17.410 --> 28:18.110]  You got a basket?
[28:18.570 --> 28:19.910]  Yeah, I still have the basket.
[28:20.330 --> 28:22.870]  But do you have the exploded kettle thing?
[28:23.230 --> 28:25.610]  Pot? The exploded kettle pot?
[28:26.170 --> 28:28.230]  No. Well, what was that thing that you broke in the bowl?
[28:29.090 --> 28:30.890]  Yeah. I broke the bowl.
[28:30.990 --> 28:31.930]  No, the bowl is gone.
[28:32.010 --> 28:33.150]  I don't have the bowl anymore.
[28:33.670 --> 28:35.250]  I don't have the waffle bomb anymore.
[28:35.250 --> 28:36.670]  Do you have the hot dog maker?
[28:37.050 --> 28:38.710]  I still have the hot dog maker.
[28:39.310 --> 28:44.810]  I still have the trash bag of fire extinguisher remnants.
[28:45.130 --> 28:47.930]  When we fired that, that's still here.
[28:48.350 --> 28:51.610]  We should collect all of our museum stuff and take pictures of our collections
[28:51.610 --> 28:52.850]  so far, but we should.
[28:53.410 --> 28:55.790]  You have the BTS sauce still, right?
[28:56.170 --> 28:57.470]  I still have all the BT.
[28:57.470 --> 28:58.950]  I've gotten into my supply a little bit.
[28:59.070 --> 29:00.690]  The market is not. It's not great.
[29:01.310 --> 29:02.110]  You've been digging in?
[29:02.370 --> 29:03.370]  Well, a little bit.
[29:03.370 --> 29:04.770]  Well, you can't have any this week.
[29:05.390 --> 29:06.950]  Can't have any of this week. That's right.
[29:07.150 --> 29:09.450]  What about the the waffle mix?
[29:09.770 --> 29:10.430]  Pancake mix?
[29:10.770 --> 29:12.970]  Oh, I still got like 50 pounds of that.
[29:13.170 --> 29:14.210]  Forget speeds.
[29:15.490 --> 29:17.690]  Speaking of how long can you eat something after it expires?
[29:18.090 --> 29:18.990]  Yeah, I think that's you.
[29:19.070 --> 29:20.970]  Do you still have the sushi container you tripped on?
[29:21.230 --> 29:23.390]  No, I think the sushi container is gone, sadly.
[29:23.770 --> 29:24.990]  Yeah, that's gone.
[29:25.090 --> 29:25.930]  Isn't there anything I still got?
[29:26.050 --> 29:29.090]  I got the bottle of shampoo that I thought was between my ass.
[29:29.150 --> 29:29.830]  We still got that.
[29:29.830 --> 29:33.450]  Oh, yeah, you got to keep that one.
[29:33.530 --> 29:35.370]  I got some fuck hats.
[29:35.470 --> 29:37.350]  I got not the Rooster Teeth store bats.
[29:37.470 --> 29:38.130]  I got a few things.
[29:38.350 --> 29:40.250]  I try to keep keep at least one of everything.
[29:40.610 --> 29:42.250]  How is not the Rooster Teeth store going?
[29:42.350 --> 29:43.170]  Are you still operating that?
[29:43.330 --> 29:44.510]  It's still not a store.
[29:45.210 --> 29:46.810]  It is continued in that.
[29:47.330 --> 29:49.390]  Yeah, I think I let the domain expire.
[29:49.530 --> 29:50.930]  I think it's out there now.
[29:51.110 --> 29:53.330]  So someone else could run a not store.
[29:54.390 --> 29:55.850]  I'm trying to think, do I have anything else?
[29:56.570 --> 29:57.270]  I think that's it.
[29:57.270 --> 30:02.210]  What would you say is your greatest collectible item related to the show?
[30:02.570 --> 30:05.750]  Oh, I got a signed signed card from Gavin.
[30:06.090 --> 30:06.370]  Oh, yeah.
[30:06.410 --> 30:08.150]  What do we what do we sell with the signature?
[30:08.370 --> 30:08.750]  What was that?
[30:08.930 --> 30:10.610]  Yeah, well, one of the bats came.
[30:10.770 --> 30:12.110]  The bats, the 50 bats, I think.
[30:12.270 --> 30:14.550]  Yeah, I bought one of the black bats and I got a Gavin card.
[30:14.990 --> 30:16.070]  I don't think I have a black bat.
[30:17.270 --> 30:18.010]  I got some stuff.
[30:18.110 --> 30:20.430]  I got the Thrice To Meet You, obviously.
[30:20.550 --> 30:23.290]  I've got two extra copies of Inside on vinyl.
[30:24.930 --> 30:26.930]  I feel like I definitely have some stuff.

[32:46.490 --> 32:49.410]  Growing up, I had quite a few people in my family who smoked,
[32:49.670 --> 32:52.650]  and I saw the process firsthand of what it was like to try to quit
[32:52.650 --> 32:55.770]  and then to try to curb those cravings after quitting.
[32:55.970 --> 32:56.810]  It's so difficult.
[32:57.410 --> 32:59.790]  It's it's something that can be a real challenge for people.
[32:59.870 --> 33:01.230]  And if that's something you're going through,
[33:01.610 --> 33:03.730]  I have a product that you should check out called Fume.

[34:21.230 --> 34:23.790]  You know what? I threw away the beef bracelet.
[34:23.910 --> 34:28.170]  Well, I ate the beef bracelet, threw away the two spicy icy.
[34:28.790 --> 34:32.130]  I gave the wrist pocket to somebody and I don't know who,
[34:32.230 --> 34:33.270]  because Rebecca said it wasn't her.
[34:33.930 --> 34:35.430]  Oh, I was about to find that.
[34:35.490 --> 34:38.130]  If anybody has my wrist pocket, my pocket promo, give it back.
[34:38.770 --> 34:40.830]  Yeah, the gesture was that I gave it to you.
[34:40.890 --> 34:41.590]  Now gesture back.
[34:42.770 --> 34:44.230]  You have a Cosmic Crisp.
[34:44.590 --> 34:46.390]  Oh, I have a Cosmic Crisp in my fridge.
[34:46.850 --> 34:47.470]  That reminds me.
[34:47.630 --> 34:49.930]  I got a reply back from the Cosmic Crisp people.
[34:50.270 --> 34:51.930]  Oh shit! I got that in the past.
[34:53.130 --> 34:55.330]  It's not it's not the best of updates.
[34:55.930 --> 34:56.550]  Oh dear.
[34:56.930 --> 34:59.610]  They replied, thank you so much for sharing it,
[34:59.610 --> 35:02.750]  because I sent them some fan art that somebody made in our community.
[35:02.850 --> 35:04.090]  Cosmic Crisp was very cool.
[35:04.510 --> 35:08.230]  Then they said, I will listen to the podcast before the end of the week,
[35:08.330 --> 35:10.270]  and I'm super excited to share it with the team.
[35:11.850 --> 35:13.510]  Oh, oh, God.
[35:13.970 --> 35:16.290]  I was told that I should have sent the episode
[35:17.450 --> 35:21.170]  where we discovered the Cosmic Crisp and had a lot of excitement
[35:21.170 --> 35:22.450]  about there being a new Apple.
[35:22.750 --> 35:23.950]  Yeah, that would have been the way to go.
[35:24.070 --> 35:25.130]  That was the right move.
[35:25.370 --> 35:26.090]  That was the right move.
[35:26.090 --> 35:27.070]  Well, now we know.
[35:27.530 --> 35:28.210]  Now we know.
[35:28.930 --> 35:30.510]  I'll let you know if I hear back from them.
[35:30.850 --> 35:33.930]  Never got a reply from Kevin Donovan about us owning the tuxedo.
[35:34.770 --> 35:36.270]  They have, uh,
[35:37.730 --> 35:39.690]  can you imagine being Kevin Donovan?
[35:40.130 --> 35:43.310]  And just when I am receiving these emails from Andrew and he's like,
[35:43.370 --> 35:44.330]  hey, what's your favorite podcast?
[35:45.090 --> 35:46.670]  He's like, yeah, maybe.
[35:46.730 --> 35:47.570]  And then he's like, what's it about?
[35:47.630 --> 35:48.790]  It's like, oh, we shit on you a bunch.
[35:48.810 --> 35:49.790]  He's like, OK, never mind.
[35:49.830 --> 35:52.530]  And then like three months later, he's like, hey, I buy your tuxedo
[35:52.530 --> 35:53.650]  from your movie you made.
[35:56.150 --> 36:00.750]  Before I went on Survive Block Island, I DM'd like three survivor winners
[36:00.750 --> 36:02.410]  being like, I got any tips?
[36:02.810 --> 36:05.010]  Didn't hear back from any of them.
[36:05.210 --> 36:07.610]  No replies from any of them.
[36:08.590 --> 36:09.490]  Who did you hit up?
[36:11.010 --> 36:15.330]  I DM'd Tyson, Adam and Michelle.
[36:15.750 --> 36:19.210]  I think Michelle Fitzgerald, Adam Klein and Tyson Apostle.
[36:19.310 --> 36:22.810]  Speaking of Tyson, are you keeping up with the Challenge USA?
[36:23.170 --> 36:24.770]  Yeah, I've wanted to text you about it.
[36:24.970 --> 36:27.030]  Dude, I just watched the most recent episode.
[36:28.590 --> 36:32.490]  Well, the swimming episode where Tyson had to drag that person from Love Island.
[36:33.350 --> 36:36.910]  Is Tyson the greatest reality TV show competitor of all time?
[36:37.090 --> 36:38.730]  That was insane that he won that.
[36:38.910 --> 36:39.630]  It was insane.
[36:40.410 --> 36:41.670]  Well, he swam.
[36:41.910 --> 36:45.430]  He was like a competitive swimmer in college and he got a college scholarship
[36:45.430 --> 36:46.010]  through swimming.
[36:46.230 --> 36:49.310]  They had to do this challenge, Gav, where they're on one boat
[36:49.310 --> 36:50.610]  and they have to jump off a boat.
[36:50.690 --> 36:55.330]  And I mean, like like a I don't know, like an old rusty, like
[36:56.150 --> 36:57.710]  like some sort of a work boat.
[36:57.790 --> 36:58.390]  It's not a pretty boat.
[36:58.490 --> 36:59.230]  It's not a yacht or anything.
[36:59.570 --> 37:03.310]  And they have to dive off like maybe 10, 12 feet into the water
[37:03.310 --> 37:08.170]  and they swim 450 feet, I believe, or 450 yards.
[37:08.530 --> 37:13.610]  And then they have to look at a like a I don't know,
[37:13.650 --> 37:17.210]  something bobbing in the water and on it is a code like a numerical code
[37:17.210 --> 37:18.050]  of like 10 digits.
[37:18.230 --> 37:22.250]  Then they have to swim another 100 yards, climb up onto another boat.
[37:22.250 --> 37:24.770]  And then there's a ton of barrels and on the top of the barrels.
[37:24.770 --> 37:27.350]  And when I say a ton, I mean like 60 barrels at the barrels
[37:27.350 --> 37:29.030]  have different number patterns on the top.
[37:29.330 --> 37:31.830]  And they have to run around and find their pattern, open it up.
[37:31.970 --> 37:32.830]  If they get the wrong one,
[37:32.890 --> 37:35.130]  they have to swim all the way back and start over again.
[37:35.290 --> 37:37.570]  If they get the right one, they take two puzzle pieces
[37:37.570 --> 37:41.090]  or a pile of puzzle pieces, and then they have to start all over again
[37:41.090 --> 37:43.270]  and go back and do it again to find the second barrel
[37:43.630 --> 37:45.290]  and then to retrieve all their puzzle pieces.
[37:45.570 --> 37:48.610]  And the guy Tyson, who you know from Survivor,
[37:48.950 --> 37:52.230]  he like the blonde dude with the ponytail who won and was on like three
[37:52.230 --> 37:55.090]  or four times. He his partner wasn't a very strong swimmer.
[37:55.470 --> 37:59.410]  And so he she just laid back like on her back
[37:59.410 --> 38:01.810]  and he pulled her the entire time.
[38:01.950 --> 38:04.450]  And then when they got there, she opened up the wrong barrel.
[38:04.810 --> 38:07.130]  So they had to go back to the beginning and do it all over again.
[38:07.190 --> 38:13.130]  So he had to do it an extra time and pull her through the entirety of it
[38:13.130 --> 38:14.050]  while swimming.
[38:14.050 --> 38:17.310]  And he he still won and beat like 10 other teams.
[38:17.610 --> 38:18.670]  It was insane.
[38:19.050 --> 38:20.930]  It's a great episode. It's a great season.
[38:20.930 --> 38:24.430]  It's especially the last few have really amped up.
[38:24.490 --> 38:25.630]  I'm enjoying it quite a bit.
[38:26.090 --> 38:29.810]  There's a dude from another dude from Survivor who was an NFL player
[38:29.810 --> 38:32.410]  who had I don't remember his name, but he had like long dreadlocks.
[38:32.470 --> 38:33.730]  And he's like a real muscular dude.
[38:33.830 --> 38:36.030]  And he talked about he's like, I'm not the best swimmer in the world,
[38:36.050 --> 38:39.630]  but looking over while I'm swimming and seeing Tyson swim past me
[38:39.630 --> 38:42.770]  pulling somebody is maybe one of the most depressing things
[38:42.770 --> 38:43.630]  I've ever experienced.
[38:43.750 --> 38:45.590]  He was like, I never felt more like crying in my life.
[38:45.790 --> 38:48.490]  That was Danny. And he was an NFL player.
[38:48.490 --> 38:51.750]  It's one of my favorite reality bits in a long time.
[38:51.970 --> 38:56.090]  Every single episode, he references his wife in some way to what is happening.
[38:56.770 --> 38:57.670]  And it's great.
[38:58.190 --> 39:01.490]  It doesn't matter what they're doing, like they'll be in the most recent episode.
[39:01.970 --> 39:04.310]  They had to jump off of a high thing in the water.
[39:04.530 --> 39:07.170]  And he's just like, my wife, Kiki and I, we went on vacation
[39:07.170 --> 39:09.230]  and she jumped off this big rock.
[39:09.330 --> 39:10.890]  So then I had to jump off the big rock.
[39:10.970 --> 39:13.090]  So thank you, Kiki, for preparing me for this moment.
[39:13.370 --> 39:14.570]  Every fucking episode.
[39:14.770 --> 39:17.710]  We're like seven episodes in and there's at least one
[39:17.710 --> 39:19.190]  Kiki mentioned per episode.
[39:19.310 --> 39:20.150]  And it's fantastic.
[39:20.450 --> 39:22.450]  It's you almost wonder, like
[39:23.190 --> 39:25.610]  he makes every opportunity he gets on camera to go like,
[39:25.870 --> 39:29.110]  hey, just so y'all know, I love my wife a lot and she's awesome and she's the best.
[39:29.310 --> 39:31.490]  And she's my she's my motivation for everything in life.
[39:31.510 --> 39:33.790]  Just just just saying that I haven't said it yet today on camera.
[39:33.810 --> 39:34.670]  So just so you guys know.
[39:35.090 --> 39:36.730]  Yeah, it's one of three things.
[39:36.810 --> 39:41.190]  Either he as a joke, like made an agreement that he would bring his wife
[39:41.190 --> 39:44.150]  like him and his wife had like a bet of like, I bet you I could bring you up
[39:44.150 --> 39:46.030]  every episode that's happening.
[39:46.670 --> 39:49.790]  Or he just naturally talks about his wife, Kiki, all the time.
[39:50.170 --> 39:53.650]  Or the people that are interviewing him for those interviews,
[39:53.890 --> 39:57.510]  like noticed it was a thing and have like set him up to do it every episode.
[39:57.930 --> 39:59.530]  Either way, it's great.
[39:59.850 --> 40:00.610]  I'm loving it.
[40:01.050 --> 40:04.770]  Or fourth, he got in trouble and he's apologizing every chance he can on camera.
[40:05.410 --> 40:08.110]  Like just throwing that out there, just reminding everybody I love my wife.
[40:08.210 --> 40:08.710]  She's the best.
[40:09.130 --> 40:11.270]  I was saying to Gavin, I was trying to get him to watch it, Geoff.
[40:11.410 --> 40:15.950]  A great moment from this season of when every episode they change partners.
[40:16.790 --> 40:19.150]  Yeah. And so they're getting ready to do this challenge.
[40:19.330 --> 40:22.830]  And before it starts, Tyson is like trying to hype them, hype up him
[40:22.830 --> 40:24.850]  and his partner and talk about how they're like, they're going to win.
[40:25.050 --> 40:29.330]  And he's like, somebody in the house said that they rode 12 miles on a bike once.
[40:29.470 --> 40:30.990]  That's not even a warm up.
[40:31.370 --> 40:34.850]  And then his partner laughed and said, Tyson, I'm the one who said that.
[40:35.250 --> 40:39.190]  And he like so genuinely looked at that was like, oh, shit, you were Alyssa.
[40:39.830 --> 40:42.110]  12 miles is not even a warm up.
[40:44.270 --> 40:44.910]  It's great.
[40:45.360 --> 40:46.210]  It's a very good season.
[40:46.710 --> 40:49.510]  I've had a you know, you know, I've had problems in the past
[40:49.510 --> 40:51.950]  with like carpet mushrooms and sink mushrooms.
[40:52.170 --> 40:54.510]  I forgot. But yes, yes, you did.
[40:54.670 --> 40:57.630]  Afraid of like your life is like it follows with mushrooms.
[40:57.990 --> 41:01.290]  Yeah. I just don't want to die of like inhaling mold.
[41:01.490 --> 41:03.970]  So I'm always slightly wary of stuff.
[41:04.030 --> 41:06.810]  And I found I had this little canvas
[41:06.810 --> 41:09.550]  lent up against my wall in my office.
[41:09.550 --> 41:10.490]  It's like under my desk.
[41:10.830 --> 41:12.590]  And I moved it recently.
[41:12.590 --> 41:18.190]  And on the skirting board, Jesus, I'm just like, oh,
[41:19.250 --> 41:21.210]  that's that looks like water damage.
[41:21.490 --> 41:23.730]  Looks like some rot.
[41:24.930 --> 41:27.110]  So then we had people out checking the roof.
[41:27.810 --> 41:30.390]  Turns out, yeah, there's a there's a hole in the roof.
[41:30.470 --> 41:33.970]  It's just like been leaking down into the into the house.
[41:34.170 --> 41:36.630]  So the guy was like, yeah, we should probably take a look in the wall.
[41:36.830 --> 41:39.710]  And I guess in my head, I thought, you know, he's just going to
[41:39.710 --> 41:41.750]  fill a little hole and snake a camera in, maybe.
[41:42.890 --> 41:44.730]  And I just let him into my office.
[41:44.950 --> 41:47.430]  And he eventually was like, yeah, no, it's all good in the wall.
[41:47.570 --> 41:49.950]  It must have been just like a tiny amount of water.
[41:49.950 --> 41:51.970]  That's just done that through the wood.
[41:51.990 --> 41:53.890]  But there's there's no like pooling water in there.
[41:53.910 --> 41:56.070]  There's no there's no real damage.
[41:56.490 --> 41:58.750]  So, yeah, you're all good.
[41:59.190 --> 42:00.370]  And then I went into my office.
[42:04.030 --> 42:05.330]  I'm like, oh, thanks.
[42:06.010 --> 42:10.610]  Thanks for cutting open three different holes.
[42:12.150 --> 42:13.730]  And that's not an easy repair.
[42:14.030 --> 42:15.450]  I thought I'd be able to patch it.
[42:15.930 --> 42:17.590]  Not the way he cut it. It's not.
[42:19.490 --> 42:20.790]  And they're so jank.
[42:20.970 --> 42:22.350]  Like he didn't even make them square.
[42:22.750 --> 42:23.710]  I don't know what I'm going to do with that.
[42:24.530 --> 42:25.950]  I'll tell you one thing you're going to do.
[42:26.030 --> 42:27.170]  You're going to cut more away.
[42:27.390 --> 42:28.210]  You're not fitting in.
[42:28.470 --> 42:31.510]  Like the first thing to do you have to do is make that hole bigger.
[42:31.750 --> 42:36.050]  Unfortunately, he's got between three different studs, all the jauntiest angles.
[42:36.570 --> 42:41.930]  And then he stacked up all the pieces like a puzzle next to it.
[42:42.350 --> 42:45.910]  It was like he made his cuts on a teeter totter the way they go up and down.
[42:47.330 --> 42:48.990]  There's no reason for it to be that.
[42:49.090 --> 42:50.310]  Why would he do it that way?
[42:51.050 --> 42:52.090]  That's so bad.
[42:52.870 --> 42:54.490]  So did you get your roof repaired?
[42:54.830 --> 42:57.590]  Yeah, yeah, that's that's sorted out.
[42:57.670 --> 43:00.830]  And I was expecting a much more dire situation.
[43:01.270 --> 43:05.630]  I mean, if you hadn't moved that picture, you would have had the only thing saving you.
[43:06.050 --> 43:11.230]  Probably the only thing saving you in the world is that it hasn't rained in Texas in 900 days.
[43:11.930 --> 43:12.530]  Yeah. Yeah.
[43:12.530 --> 43:14.310]  Except that it did rain yesterday a little bit.
[43:14.390 --> 43:15.810]  I don't know if it rained at yours.
[43:16.450 --> 43:18.290]  These are the the puzzle pieces he left.
[43:21.850 --> 43:24.270]  Those those puzzle pieces fit right in the trash.
[43:26.890 --> 43:29.230]  And when it looks like a reality puzzle.
[43:29.550 --> 43:31.270]  Yeah, almost. It does.
[43:31.630 --> 43:33.230]  Looks like a survivor by the count.
[43:33.630 --> 43:38.090]  Walls, I've always like, you know, carefully taken off like a yeah, I don't like a network panel.
[43:38.090 --> 43:40.850]  And I've like snaking up cables through tiny holes.
[43:40.970 --> 43:45.390]  I never thought to just gouge the entire wall open because that would have saved me so much sweat and time.
[43:45.830 --> 43:47.130]  Like, is that an easy fix?
[43:47.570 --> 43:48.490]  What do I do with that?
[43:48.930 --> 43:51.010]  And I mean, it's an easy fix for some people.
[43:51.990 --> 43:56.230]  Yeah, I would hire probably someone to do it.
[43:57.490 --> 43:58.470]  Is this something you want?
[43:58.510 --> 43:59.710]  Is it and it's not hard.
[44:00.170 --> 44:05.410]  You just going to need to buy a wall board and cuts cut it.
[44:05.570 --> 44:08.170]  Well, you're going to have to you're going to have to straighten that shit out.
[44:08.250 --> 44:10.010]  That is a first.
[44:12.230 --> 44:14.130]  And then is that thing to the left?
[44:14.330 --> 44:16.210]  That's looks like it's covered in insulation.
[44:16.410 --> 44:19.770]  Is that a pipe or something, or is that a two by four?
[44:20.890 --> 44:23.590]  Just looks like another stud with insulation foam.
[44:24.170 --> 44:28.670]  OK, OK, so you can you can hammer or screw into that safely.
[44:30.130 --> 44:30.850]  Yeah. OK.
[44:31.970 --> 44:32.970]  Yeah, you can do that.
[44:33.030 --> 44:35.670]  That's a that's a that's like a two hour project on a Saturday.
[44:36.130 --> 44:36.890]  You want me to help you?
[44:36.990 --> 44:38.470]  You want help? You want me to come help you do it?
[44:39.650 --> 44:40.510]  That'd be good content.
[44:40.990 --> 44:44.950]  I've never done I've never done a patch job that big before.
[44:44.990 --> 44:45.890]  But how hard can it be?
[44:46.410 --> 44:49.050]  I mean, I'm tempted just to put the puzzle pieces back in and just
[44:49.750 --> 44:51.690]  I don't know, patch it all back in.
[44:52.450 --> 44:53.450]  You could try.
[44:53.850 --> 44:57.290]  I mean, we could try that first and save you money and time if you can do that.
[44:58.430 --> 45:02.270]  I really want Geoff to come over and for you guys to cut more out
[45:02.270 --> 45:03.630]  and then somehow fuck up more.
[45:03.890 --> 45:05.730]  And Gavin's is going to have to replace the whole wall.
[45:05.890 --> 45:08.890]  Like every attempt just incrementally makes it a larger hole.
[45:09.050 --> 45:10.650]  Is that actually fix the problem?
[45:11.070 --> 45:14.110]  Is that the back leg of a desk that I'm seeing in the photo?
[45:14.690 --> 45:16.490]  Yeah, that's my I'm sat at that desk now.
[45:16.710 --> 45:19.390]  So, OK, so that's under where your feet are. Yeah.
[45:19.910 --> 45:22.770]  OK. Has the cat gotten it or any of the cats gotten in there yet?
[45:23.110 --> 45:24.890]  Yeah. Yeah, they will.
[45:26.250 --> 45:27.590]  Cats will get in your walls.
[45:27.830 --> 45:30.530]  Yeah. Yeah. I make sure they can't like climb up any higher.
[45:30.650 --> 45:33.790]  But there's there's just tons of other insulation that they can't get past.
[45:33.830 --> 45:34.250]  So that's fine.
[45:34.610 --> 45:38.130]  When I was like 14 or 15, we're renovating a bathroom
[45:38.130 --> 45:41.970]  and like we took out the back of the tub wall
[45:41.970 --> 45:46.150]  and then our cat hopped down the hole and we couldn't get it out.
[45:46.210 --> 45:50.690]  So we had to like cut half the other wall open to be able to reach the cat.
[45:50.750 --> 45:53.830]  Like it just it delayed the project by months
[45:53.830 --> 45:57.190]  and made everything so much more expensive because that dumb cat
[45:57.190 --> 46:00.250]  hopped down the smallest hole and just had no way to get out.
[46:00.350 --> 46:02.550]  It was impossible. It's a disaster.
[46:03.070 --> 46:04.790]  I'm glad that your cats are able to get in and out.
[46:05.050 --> 46:05.930]  Oh, they love a new hole.
[46:06.550 --> 46:07.790]  Yeah, it's one of their favorite things.
[46:08.170 --> 46:10.330]  Yeah, I was kind of worried that there would just be a gap
[46:10.330 --> 46:12.730]  like all the way down through the floor that they could fall in.
[46:12.830 --> 46:15.170]  But it that there is there is like a floor there. So that's good.
[46:15.310 --> 46:17.650]  Good. Are you just on the first floor of your house?
[46:17.850 --> 46:19.170]  Yes. Upstairs. That's upstairs.
[46:19.570 --> 46:22.110]  Oh, OK. And it didn't drip any further down.
[46:22.730 --> 46:25.010]  Nope. Yeah, you must have caught it really fast
[46:25.010 --> 46:27.890]  and also benefited from the fact that we're in a tremendous drought.
[46:28.190 --> 46:29.470]  Do you have a fridge, Geoff?
[46:29.810 --> 46:32.290]  Yeah. Are you still waiting for your fridge? Did it ever arrive?
[46:32.510 --> 46:34.190]  Well, is it February of 2023?
[46:34.970 --> 46:37.090]  OK, I just want to check it.
[46:37.170 --> 46:39.650]  No, I don't. I still have a fridge.
[46:40.150 --> 46:43.210]  I still have I have a fridge that I feel like.
[46:43.510 --> 46:46.730]  Do you know how like sometimes you'll look at your you'll just check to see
[46:46.730 --> 46:50.010]  what's my what's my max iPhone battery at now?
[46:50.010 --> 46:52.950]  And you're like, if it's like over like ninety five, ninety six percent,
[46:52.990 --> 46:53.570]  I'm still good.
[46:53.930 --> 46:56.330]  I don't need to worry about replacing it, you know, and you'll look
[46:56.330 --> 46:58.430]  and it'll be like, oh, 98% still. Oh, that's cool.
[46:58.510 --> 47:01.710]  I still still got a lot of good battery life in this battery.
[47:02.130 --> 47:05.030]  Sometimes like when I got rid of my last phone, my battery was like
[47:05.030 --> 47:07.110]  it was like your max charge can get to eighty seven percent.
[47:07.170 --> 47:08.530]  I was like, fuck that. I got to get a new phone.
[47:11.190 --> 47:12.850]  I I assume.
[47:13.830 --> 47:15.410]  What the fuck was I talking about?
[47:17.650 --> 47:18.710]  A new fridge.
[47:19.050 --> 47:21.870]  Oh, yeah, my fridge, my fridge.
[47:21.990 --> 47:22.930]  If I could check.
[47:23.310 --> 47:25.010]  Damn, man, I'm getting dumb.
[47:25.490 --> 47:30.110]  My my fridge, I would estimate the max capacity
[47:30.910 --> 47:34.790]  would if it were an iPhone battery would be like 78% right now.
[47:35.050 --> 47:36.290]  And then like cooling ability.
[47:36.550 --> 47:38.490]  Yeah, just like function ability functionality.
[47:38.810 --> 47:41.590]  And I would say it was like it was probably like in the 80s
[47:42.710 --> 47:43.730]  earlier this year.
[47:43.730 --> 47:46.470]  So I'm thinking by the end of the year, it might be in the high 60s.
[47:46.550 --> 47:51.290]  Like it's it's it's it's it's I can feel it dying a little bit every day.
[47:51.610 --> 47:56.570]  I'm just hoping against hope that it doesn't die until February.
[47:56.590 --> 47:59.190]  How many percent a month do you think you're losing?
[47:59.550 --> 48:01.750]  I think I'm losing two or three percent a month right now.
[48:02.030 --> 48:03.790]  OK, and what are you currently at?
[48:04.330 --> 48:05.590]  I think I'm in the 70s.
[48:05.650 --> 48:08.310]  I think I was I think I was probably in the high 80s
[48:08.310 --> 48:09.330]  when this whole thing started.
[48:09.530 --> 48:11.050]  And then I think, you know what?
[48:11.050 --> 48:13.950]  Fuck, dude, maybe I'm in the low 70s right now.
[48:14.110 --> 48:16.250]  Yeah, I think I'm being too optimistic.
[48:16.430 --> 48:19.850]  I think I'm in the low 70s right now, and I could dip into the 60s
[48:19.850 --> 48:21.070]  before the summer's over.
[48:21.630 --> 48:24.050]  Andrew, what percentage a month do your ankles lose?
[48:25.350 --> 48:27.890]  Right now, we're flying at a steady hundred percent.
[48:28.250 --> 48:29.530]  We're going to keep it that way.
[48:30.070 --> 48:31.690]  And so with COVID, you're 100.
[48:32.070 --> 48:32.670]  That's pretty impressive.
[48:33.050 --> 48:35.130]  Yeah. Well, something always has to be wrong.
[48:35.210 --> 48:36.410]  So I think it's been a trade off.
[48:36.490 --> 48:38.290]  We went upper body instead of lower body.
[48:39.570 --> 48:42.650]  Dude, the second you get over that COVID, you're going to get jock itch.
[48:42.850 --> 48:43.210]  Watch out.
[48:43.710 --> 48:44.670]  Oh, I hope not.
[48:44.930 --> 48:46.550]  That would be, ugh.
[48:46.930 --> 48:47.590]  It sounds terrible.
[48:47.990 --> 48:49.510]  Does this help you come to the U.S.
[48:49.570 --> 48:51.130]  any sooner, having COVID now?
[48:52.210 --> 48:54.730]  Oh, no. Oh, not really.
[48:54.910 --> 48:57.050]  You'll be like super immune for a while.
[48:57.550 --> 48:59.290]  Yeah, I guess. Natural immunity for a bit.
[48:59.710 --> 49:02.110]  Yeah. The best time for you to come would be like next week, probably.
[49:02.750 --> 49:05.650]  I don't there's I think I would go to the U.S.
[49:05.650 --> 49:09.650]  either for like a scheduled event or it would be completely unannounced.
[49:10.010 --> 49:11.050]  And I'd just do it.
[49:11.330 --> 49:12.570]  Who are you hiding from?
[49:13.190 --> 49:17.330]  Nobody. I just I think I think I think it would be funny
[49:17.970 --> 49:21.850]  to record one of these in Texas without telling you guys.
[49:22.250 --> 49:24.990]  And not just to be like, hey, last week I was in Austin recording.
[49:25.310 --> 49:26.470]  No, I don't think I do that.
[49:26.570 --> 49:29.550]  I think we would I'd want to spend time with both of you and everyone.
[49:29.870 --> 49:30.550]  Everyone else here.
[49:30.810 --> 49:33.010]  Why do you want to hide from us and not mention it?
[49:33.630 --> 49:36.810]  Well, I think it would be funny to do it, though, within the context
[49:36.810 --> 49:40.270]  of a bit of an episode reveal at the end, then obviously spend time
[49:40.270 --> 49:41.430]  from there, probably like a week.
[49:41.950 --> 49:43.830]  So just one day I'd schedule it.
[49:43.990 --> 49:46.170]  So like on a Thursday would be like day one.
[49:46.370 --> 49:48.830]  How are you coming here first or we go in there first?
[49:49.170 --> 49:50.510]  That's I don't know.
[49:51.290 --> 49:53.010]  Let me ask you like you were coming in November.
[49:53.410 --> 49:54.290]  Let me ask you a question, Andrew.
[49:55.290 --> 49:57.050]  How are you at patching drywall?
[50:00.270 --> 50:02.590]  Maybe maybe I'm a savant at it.
[50:02.590 --> 50:04.010]  We don't know. I've never done it.
[50:04.410 --> 50:05.430]  Probably not good.
[50:05.810 --> 50:06.670]  Probably terrible.
[50:07.190 --> 50:08.970]  I'd love to hire you for a job. I have.
[50:14.880 --> 50:15.940]  I think I could do it.
[50:16.060 --> 50:18.300]  Oh, OK. So if I was so, hmm.
[50:18.480 --> 50:21.360]  Let me look at this whole how I would solve this problem.
[50:21.560 --> 50:23.000]  Not knowing anything, what I would need.
[50:23.240 --> 50:25.540]  I would need some glue.
[50:26.080 --> 50:27.640]  I would need some nails.
[50:28.280 --> 50:32.600]  I would need paint and I would need another wall.
[50:35.560 --> 50:37.200]  What do you do or glue?
[50:38.400 --> 50:40.120]  He's going to glue the puzzle back together.
[50:40.520 --> 50:43.300]  Or yeah. So initially I thought maybe I glue.
[50:43.400 --> 50:45.320]  But then I realized with nails, you brought up a great point.
[50:45.380 --> 50:46.280]  I could nail.
[50:47.180 --> 50:48.400]  Maybe I just need wood.
[50:48.620 --> 50:50.040]  Hmm. OK, so I get wood.
[50:50.280 --> 50:52.880]  I nail between slats.
[50:53.580 --> 50:55.060]  Right. Make it solid.
[50:56.240 --> 50:57.580]  How do I make a wall?
[50:59.180 --> 51:01.120]  Can I craft the wall?
[51:01.640 --> 51:04.680]  You sound like someone who's shopping from the end caps of home.
[51:04.680 --> 51:04.960]  Depot.
[51:06.780 --> 51:08.960]  You know what fucking sucks about this?
[51:09.040 --> 51:10.020]  Looking at it a little closer.
[51:10.280 --> 51:13.980]  He's cut or they they have cut two.
[51:14.240 --> 51:19.280]  And I think I suspect in some spots below your floor board there.
[51:19.500 --> 51:23.060]  So that's probably going to have to come off the sky.
[51:23.320 --> 51:24.740]  And yeah, yeah. To repair this.
[51:24.760 --> 51:26.100]  And that's fucking annoying.
[51:26.300 --> 51:30.080]  And above that, I like that he's just gouged a line where he clearly.
[51:30.880 --> 51:32.180]  Went up a bit too high.
[51:32.620 --> 51:33.660]  Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.
[51:33.660 --> 51:35.600]  You can see his skill. So I kept going. Yeah.
[51:36.620 --> 51:40.820]  I think if I had to repair this realistically, I would just put a larger
[51:40.820 --> 51:43.980]  piece of wood over it and then paint it to look like something else.
[51:44.080 --> 51:45.520]  I would just fully cover the wall.
[51:45.800 --> 51:49.740]  Yeah, that this doesn't look like he's used any sort of power tool to me.
[51:50.320 --> 51:53.780]  It just looks like he's got like a handheld drywall saw
[51:53.780 --> 51:56.740]  and just gone absolutely apeshit, not tried to make any corners.
[51:58.100 --> 51:59.680]  I think, uh.
[52:00.960 --> 52:04.040]  What? How how committed are you to fixing this yourself
[52:04.040 --> 52:05.740]  versus paying to get somebody to do it for you?
[52:05.940 --> 52:08.420]  I mean, I like doing stuff myself.
[52:08.700 --> 52:10.120]  I just wouldn't really know what to start with.
[52:10.480 --> 52:12.480]  All right. Well, I don't need skills.
[52:12.800 --> 52:16.340]  I'm telling you, man, I I am more than happy
[52:16.340 --> 52:19.240]  to come over this weekend and figure this out.
[52:19.300 --> 52:20.420]  How hard can it be?
[52:20.880 --> 52:21.940]  I've patched walls before.
[52:22.500 --> 52:25.480]  You're going to need we're going to need some probably some new wall board.
[52:25.680 --> 52:27.160]  We're going to need some of that mesh
[52:28.100 --> 52:32.220]  that you put that you then like apply like joint compound to.
[52:32.500 --> 52:33.880]  And then we'll need the
[52:36.440 --> 52:38.580]  the sandpaper that you wrap around the stone
[52:38.580 --> 52:41.120]  or that the rubber thing to smooth it out.
[52:41.240 --> 52:44.280]  And then we'll just need primer and whatever color paint you have.
[52:44.380 --> 52:45.740]  We can do that. No glue.
[52:46.680 --> 52:48.660]  No, I think we're going to be OK without glue.
[52:50.420 --> 52:51.720]  I think we'll be fine.
[52:52.000 --> 52:53.720]  And I don't think we'll use any nails either.
[52:53.820 --> 52:54.980]  I think we'll probably use screws.
[52:55.440 --> 52:56.520]  Well, you guys figure that out.
[52:56.520 --> 53:00.080]  I will draw step by step how I would fix this.
[53:00.260 --> 53:02.160]  And I'll send it to you just in case you have any issues.
[53:02.320 --> 53:03.800]  If you need help, that would be much appreciated.
[53:04.360 --> 53:06.140]  And we can only follow your instructions.
[53:07.540 --> 53:10.980]  Now, that is a recipe for a great bit for f***face.
[53:11.040 --> 53:14.180]  If you're willing to to to let that happen to your house, Gavin.
[53:14.780 --> 53:17.800]  Either way, we've got content, because even if I do hire some guy to fix this,
[53:17.940 --> 53:20.940]  I could we could keep all the pieces of wall for the museum.
[53:22.140 --> 53:22.780]  That's true.
[53:23.760 --> 53:26.720]  I hope you'll get creative with your solutions, Andrew,
[53:26.860 --> 53:30.880]  to give us a more fun and robust experience trying to fix this wall.
[53:31.580 --> 53:34.120]  What about a staple gun? Nail gun?
[53:34.420 --> 53:35.920]  That could be good. Yeah, we could use a nail gun.
[53:35.960 --> 53:37.680]  You know what else we could do, Gav? Yeah.
[53:38.440 --> 53:39.660]  We've got your wall opened up.
[53:39.820 --> 53:43.920]  We could put in we could put in something into your wall for somebody.
[53:44.120 --> 53:45.580]  A little time capsule? A little time capsule.
[53:45.700 --> 53:47.620]  Yeah. What about a load of old razor blades?
[53:47.720 --> 53:48.860]  We could put in a f***face time capsule.
[53:49.380 --> 53:52.360]  Oh, my God. Yeah, we could just put in a bunch of razor blades from 2022.
[53:53.640 --> 53:56.400]  And people will rip over the wall and be like, this wasn't even a bathroom.
[54:02.860 --> 54:05.160]  I like the idea of the f***face time capsule there.
[54:05.400 --> 54:06.660]  That should definitely go somewhere.
[54:07.540 --> 54:08.300]  Yeah, in your wall.
[54:09.100 --> 54:10.780]  Or in the bean hole.
[54:11.020 --> 54:12.400]  Or in the bean hole, that's true.
[54:13.240 --> 54:14.580]  Oh, that reminds me.
[54:14.760 --> 54:15.760]  Eric said we should start wrapping up.
[54:16.080 --> 54:18.700]  I had an idea yesterday when I was looking at the pictures
[54:18.700 --> 54:20.120]  Eric took from the Doesn't Do shoot.
[54:20.120 --> 54:25.780]  It got me thinking, should we make an end of the year, like 2022 f***face yearbook?
[54:26.440 --> 54:30.140]  Kind of like high school with like funny, like photos from throughout the year
[54:30.140 --> 54:30.800]  and funny moments.
[54:31.060 --> 54:34.020]  It would essentially be like the plussed up version of the zine we never made.
[54:34.340 --> 54:35.620]  Yeah, that'd be kind of cool, right?
[54:35.660 --> 54:38.320]  Like a year, a year in review, year and a year
[54:38.320 --> 54:42.360]  and like a memories book of like of the last year of f***face.
[54:42.580 --> 54:46.380]  And would we, is that just like a single item or is that something we make and sell?
[54:46.620 --> 54:49.160]  I think we'd sell it. Yeah, we would make it and print it and sell it.
[54:49.160 --> 54:51.760]  And then you could get, you could, we could autograph each other's books
[54:51.760 --> 54:52.440]  and give each other.
[54:53.160 --> 54:53.980]  Oh, that's a sweet idea.
[54:53.980 --> 54:57.080]  We could put in the current f***face shirt that's for sale too.
[54:58.480 --> 54:59.400]  Yeah, that's true.
[54:59.740 --> 55:01.140]  But only in extra medium.
[55:01.960 --> 55:05.140]  You'd be like, yeah, you'd be like, hey, really had a really had a fun time
[55:05.140 --> 55:10.340]  with you at f***face this year, Andrew, and really, really excited
[55:10.340 --> 55:11.720]  that things are going so well with your ankles.
[55:12.420 --> 55:14.160]  Good luck next year. See you in 2023.
[55:14.960 --> 55:18.580]  You know, can the next shirt we sell just have XM in the collar?
[55:20.500 --> 55:22.320]  It's not a real thing, so no.
[55:23.040 --> 55:24.440]  That's for medium. Large.
[55:24.720 --> 55:25.900]  What you're looking for is an L.
[55:26.540 --> 55:28.020]  Yeah, he's wrong.
[55:28.520 --> 55:30.660]  He's not. He's so right. I'm very right.
[55:30.700 --> 55:33.040]  It's weird. It's weird because you're...
[55:33.040 --> 55:35.520]  What is the gap between medium to large?
[55:36.240 --> 55:37.060]  What are we working on?
[55:41.240 --> 55:43.480]  I bet you there's room for an extra medium.
[55:44.180 --> 55:45.460]  I need to draw a diagram.
[55:45.840 --> 55:47.920]  If there is room for, if there's room for an extra medium,
[55:47.920 --> 55:50.580]  it would be larger than a medium and smaller than a large.
[55:50.860 --> 55:53.320]  So it would not be what Gavin's asking for.
[55:53.720 --> 55:54.480]  What do you mean?
[55:54.920 --> 55:59.800]  So I just I searched shirt sizes, chest and inches, medium,
[56:00.080 --> 56:03.820]  38 inch to 40 inch, large, 41 to 43.
[56:04.080 --> 56:08.360]  So you're looking at like a 40.5 would be an extra medium.
[56:08.780 --> 56:09.620]  That's a millennium.
[56:11.620 --> 56:13.220]  I'm making a diagram here.
[56:13.820 --> 56:15.720]  OK. What's the sigh?
[56:16.140 --> 56:17.400]  I'm excited for the diagram.
[56:17.400 --> 56:19.780]  No, I'm jazzed. That was a sigh of excitement.
[56:20.040 --> 56:22.000]  That was I've never heard a less genuine.
[56:22.200 --> 56:24.040]  I was I was I'm excited.
[56:25.040 --> 56:26.540]  Jazzed. Are you kidding me?
[56:28.720 --> 56:31.500]  So this is going to be going to draw a fucking diagram
[56:31.500 --> 56:32.740]  to show us all how you're wrong.
[56:33.280 --> 56:34.360]  I mean, what are you going to draw?
[56:34.460 --> 56:37.240]  Just a shirt and then another shirt like.
[56:37.700 --> 56:38.680]  I could draw it to you, Gavin.
[56:39.400 --> 56:40.960]  Yeah. Draw, draw extra medium.
[56:41.380 --> 56:42.100]  I will. OK.
[56:42.960 --> 56:46.020]  How do I try to make the pencil thick?
[56:46.020 --> 56:47.640]  Yeah. And then this bit.
[56:47.880 --> 56:49.960]  Please don't cut any of this out, Nick.
[56:50.340 --> 56:52.900]  Yeah. Make sure this all this is the good stuff.
[56:52.940 --> 56:55.000]  I'm jazzed about this. So let's keep it as cool.
[56:58.580 --> 56:59.560]  Taking a photo.
[57:00.320 --> 57:03.900]  So, Eric, while they're drawing to get ready for face today,
[57:03.900 --> 57:05.460]  I didn't have I don't have anything planned.
[57:06.200 --> 57:08.500]  And so I thought real fast I'd look up.
[57:08.600 --> 57:11.340]  I just looked up a wacky like baseball facts.
[57:11.660 --> 57:13.840]  And I found like 35 insane baseball facts.
[57:13.860 --> 57:14.540]  And here's one.
[57:14.540 --> 57:17.300]  A lot of it's stuff we already know and a lot of it's stuff that's not super
[57:17.300 --> 57:19.520]  interesting. But here's one that I was not aware of.
[57:19.540 --> 57:20.280]  Let me see if you've heard of.
[57:20.840 --> 57:25.040]  In the mid 1800s, you could get out or be put out
[57:25.040 --> 57:29.340]  while running between the bases by having the ball thrown directly at you.
[57:29.540 --> 57:30.180]  Yeah, thrown at you.
[57:30.460 --> 57:35.000]  1880s baseball was you and out would be off of one bounce,
[57:35.000 --> 57:36.500]  like when hit to like the outfield.
[57:36.900 --> 57:40.560]  But also you could hit one of the runners with the baseball.
[57:40.780 --> 57:42.400]  Yeah, they would be out. It's pretty cool.
[57:42.400 --> 57:45.600]  It was they changed it in the mid 1800s
[57:45.600 --> 57:49.680]  and players were resistant to the change, which, by the way,
[57:49.700 --> 57:52.660]  getting hit by somebody just fucking being in the ball
[57:52.660 --> 57:54.380]  that you did not throw and knock you out.
[57:54.500 --> 57:55.600]  It was called patching.
[57:55.940 --> 58:00.140]  Oh, and and players didn't want to get rid of it
[58:00.140 --> 58:03.500]  because they considered it an important and masculine part of the game.
[58:03.920 --> 58:08.180]  Well, a thing they used to do also was you could call for
[58:08.180 --> 58:10.940]  where you wanted the ball to be pitched to you.
[58:10.940 --> 58:13.260]  You could ask for it high or low.
[58:14.000 --> 58:18.520]  And then what happened was, I think the I think Babe Ruth
[58:18.520 --> 58:22.160]  and the rest of murderers row went, give it to me high and crushed
[58:22.160 --> 58:25.920]  a million home runs and they went, well, this rule is different now.
[58:26.360 --> 58:28.140]  So that that rule changed.
[58:28.520 --> 58:30.220]  Crazy, right? That's pretty crazy.
[58:30.520 --> 58:33.180]  Did you know that during World War Two, the United States
[58:33.180 --> 58:37.540]  military military designed grenades to be the size and weight of baseballs
[58:37.540 --> 58:40.500]  since every young American man should be able to properly throw it?
[58:40.500 --> 58:41.300]  Isn't that cool?
[58:41.560 --> 58:42.700]  That's really that makes sense.
[58:42.920 --> 58:44.800]  I think that's really cool. I think that's awesome.
[58:45.780 --> 58:46.600]  I think that's pretty neat, too.
[58:46.720 --> 58:47.680]  Is that why we won the war?
[58:48.280 --> 58:49.240]  I would assume so.
[58:49.640 --> 58:51.560]  It would have ended a lot quicker if Geoff was out there
[58:51.560 --> 58:53.680]  throwing 80 mile per hour grenades. Yeah.
[58:57.040 --> 59:00.600]  I'll throw an 80 mile per hour ball right around the time you do a marathon.
[59:00.840 --> 59:01.260]  How about that?
[59:03.480 --> 59:06.940]  This is Gavin's drawing an incredibly detailed drawing, I assume.
[59:06.940 --> 59:11.040]  Well, I'm just waiting for Microsoft Paint to unfreeze again.
[59:11.200 --> 59:13.820]  Every time I save it, it freezes for about a minute.
[59:14.020 --> 59:15.180]  I'm long done with the drawing.
[59:15.820 --> 59:16.400]  OK, so.
[59:17.540 --> 59:18.800]  Andrew just drew.
[59:19.660 --> 59:21.300]  It's the tag on the inside of the shirt.
[59:21.580 --> 59:22.680]  Oh, that's the tag on the shirt.
[59:22.880 --> 59:24.300]  14.5 extra medium EM.
[59:24.380 --> 59:26.140]  OK, I like that very quick.
[59:26.200 --> 59:27.180]  That's that's way better.
[59:27.400 --> 59:29.620]  That's way better, way better than the nails you drew earlier.
[59:30.060 --> 59:31.640]  All right. Now tweet and say, what did I draw?
[59:31.860 --> 59:32.280]  Plungers, Geoff.
[59:33.780 --> 59:35.080]  That's still a...
[59:35.080 --> 59:35.700]  Did it unfreeze yet?
[59:35.700 --> 59:37.080]  You take a picture on your phone or something?
[59:37.380 --> 59:39.000]  I mean, it's eventually going to save.
[59:39.820 --> 59:40.500]  Well, that's...
[59:40.500 --> 59:40.620]  Will it?
[59:40.700 --> 59:41.440]  Oh, oh, here we go.
[59:42.180 --> 59:44.260]  I think your computer can't handle in this paint.
[59:46.640 --> 59:48.380]  You can put your most...
[59:48.380 --> 59:50.880]  I bet your computer would catch on fire if you tried to play Freesale.
[59:51.460 --> 59:51.760]  What?
[59:52.060 --> 59:53.040]  I think I won.
[59:53.120 --> 59:54.020]  Hey, hey, guys.
[59:54.140 --> 59:55.040]  I think I won this one.
[59:55.600 --> 59:56.520]  All all yours.
[59:56.680 --> 59:58.060]  I don't have anything to say about that.
[59:58.780 --> 01:00:00.520]  Well, I think that's what XM would be.
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.680]  OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:08.320]  For the audience who may not be able to see this,
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:12.180]  he has denoted the following sizes in this order.
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:15.820]  Extra small, small, medium,
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:21.020]  extra medium, medium, again, large, extra large.
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:28.420]  I am a little confused by going from medium to extra medium back to medium.
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.680]  If it's extra medium, it couldn't be more medium.
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:36.380]  So that means the other variants of medium have to be on either side of it.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:41.380]  There's literally one more on the right of extra medium.
[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:42.600]  That is more medium.
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:46.740]  You you are if its scale is increasing.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.520]  No, that's close to what I mean.
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:51.040]  Extra small isn't more small.
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.540]  It's smaller than small.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:55.100]  Extra large isn't is more large.
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:57.120]  Extra medium is more medium.
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:01.300]  You can't you what you're doing is you're flying in the face.
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:06.420]  I understand that extra small and extra large are are polar opposites.
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:08.600]  Right. Like they they flip the script on that.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.900]  It's like extra small, smaller than small.
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:12.500]  But extra large is larger than large.
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.720]  I get that's confusing, but you can't take you can't take the best of both
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.760]  and cram them together and have medium, extra medium, medium again.
[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:22.620]  They're all the same fucking size, man.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.640]  I think that's the marketing slogan for extra media.
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.560]  The best of both.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.740]  That's why there's only one black line below medium.
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:31.620]  But my point is, is the extra medium is not large.
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:35.460]  From now on, on the store.
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:40.580]  Do we have to sell small, extra medium and large?
[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.300]  We don't sell regular mediums anymore.
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.560]  We sell extra. I think they should all be extra medium.
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:47.620]  Whatever that means to whoever's buying this.
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.760]  And then we just get people mad because it's actually just medium
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.000]  and not a larger medium.
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:56.020]  If you are buying, if you wanted extra medium and you got medium,
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:57.560]  you cannot be disappointed there.
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:00.360]  I think all you've shown is disappointment.
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:03.040]  That's all I felt looking at this thing.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.080]  This is the face of disappointment.
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:08.880]  If you had to put it anywhere on that scale, where else would you put it?
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:09.520]  Other than there?
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.140]  I have no answer.
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:14.320]  Eric's saying it would be under large.
[01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:16.160]  It would be before large.
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.040]  I would put it, I'd put it above medium.
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.080]  I'd go medium and extra medium in the space before large.
[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:22.020]  Yeah, you get it.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.820]  Well, first off, you get to give it a 40.5.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.120]  There's no need for two mediums and an extra medium.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.480]  You got a medium and an extra medium.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.280]  It's a 4.5, 40.5.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:31.860]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:33.560]  Why do we have three mediums?
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:34.980]  We don't. There's one medium.
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:37.400]  He drew it. He put it.
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.620]  He put medium on there twice and is saying there's one medium.
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:44.000]  Well, he's he's referring to the hash marks he drew, but
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:47.380]  he couldn't have created a more confusing document.
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:51.120]  There's got to be one person who agrees with me,
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.600]  but that's where that should go on the scale.
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:55.980]  I'm sure out of seven and a half billion people,
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.820]  there is one person who will agree with you.
[01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:02.700]  Yeah, I think and I bet we could find that person if we looked hard enough.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.380]  Oh, job done.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.780]  All right, so that's well.
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.740]  I kind of just wanted to give Eric a headache for the.
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:17.480]  Mission accomplished, buddy.
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:18.300]  Absolutely.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.260]  100 percent. God damn nailed it.
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:25.500]  Yeah, look at how he drew two lines for small and two lines for large
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:29.340]  and one line for medium, but three let like fuck this.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.400]  Yeah, it's it's absolutely insane.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.160]  There's all kinds of Andrew levels of fucking.
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:35.800]  Absolutely.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.280]  Hey, Gavin, you're the Andrew of this episode.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:39.220]  I can't believe you did this.
[01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:41.580]  Call you Greg Junior.
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:45.840]  All right. Well, there you go.
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:48.980]  You probably you probably made it to the end of this.
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:49.560]  Maybe you didn't.
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:50.540]  If you didn't, then you don't hear this.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.040]  So it doesn't matter.
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:54.420]  But those of you that are listening to this, I applaud you.
[01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:55.160]  Thank you.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.420]  You are you.
[01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.340]  Heroes don't wear capes.
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:03:58.980]  That's clear.
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:02.320]  Uh, maybe listen again next time.
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.240]  It'll be episode 119.
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.740]  I don't know. That doesn't refer.
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:08.140]  That's it means nothing.
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:11.840]  But other than it'll be one after this one and one before episode 120.
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.980]  The extra medium conversation wasn't even in this episode.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:22.200]  Hey, guys, super fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of Face.
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.500]  Geoff's bedroom is on the Death Star.
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.180]  It's hot pot without Gavin.
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:27.500]  Town Lake flooded.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.520]  The jock itch won't go away.
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:31.520]  Canadian in caps are huge.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.500]  Extra medium is not a thing.
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.280]  What the hell is Marge?
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.900]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.420]  All that and more on next week's episode of Face.
