[00:15.300 --> 00:19.700]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face podcast.
[00:20.200 --> 00:26.260]  My name is Geoff Ramsey and with me, as always, Andrew Pantin and Gavin Free,
[00:26.600 --> 00:28.780]  my two best little friends in the world.
[00:29.140 --> 00:31.560]  How are you guys doing? Good. I'm doing great.
[00:32.000 --> 00:34.340]  How are you doing, Gavin? Good. Oh, could you not hear me? Nothing.
[00:34.520 --> 00:36.480]  OK, great. Fantastic. This is good.
[00:36.720 --> 00:37.940]  This is like old F*** Face.
[00:38.320 --> 00:42.560]  This is like... He's in the f***ing Discord.
[00:42.980 --> 00:47.140]  Yeah, but I don't... He clearly can't hear us or he's talking or his mic has an issue.
[00:47.480 --> 00:48.680]  We went through this last time, right?
[00:48.720 --> 00:50.900]  We're like his mic wasn't connected to the correct thing.
[00:51.920 --> 00:56.220]  Before the episode started, we said F*** Face isn't really like a technical...
[00:57.740 --> 01:00.180]  We're just f***ing wrong. We were wrong.
[01:00.300 --> 01:02.200]  Can you still not hear me? No, we can hear you now.
[01:02.200 --> 01:03.080]  You got it, you got it. Hey!
[01:04.280 --> 01:05.860]  Ah, mute. I was on mute.
[01:05.860 --> 01:08.640]  You were muted? That wasn't the issue.
[01:08.860 --> 01:10.760]  OK, but that's not even technical difficulties.
[01:10.980 --> 01:11.920]  That's not... OK.
[01:12.220 --> 01:14.740]  I was muted, like, further up the Discord.
[01:14.940 --> 01:16.320]  So not in this... I thought, you know.
[01:16.760 --> 01:18.860]  That's not technical difficulties. That's technical dickhead.
[01:22.140 --> 01:24.500]  So, Gavin, how are you doing now that you got a voice?
[01:24.760 --> 01:26.020]  Not too bad. Thanks for asking.
[01:27.120 --> 01:27.520]  OK.
[01:29.600 --> 01:31.320]  I didn't get a thanks. I asked you first.
[01:31.840 --> 01:33.640]  Thanks for asking, Andrew. Thank you.
[01:33.760 --> 01:34.500]  Thank you. I wanted that.
[01:35.100 --> 01:36.200]  My day is complete now.
[01:36.300 --> 01:41.240]  So I have... I was telling them, Gavin, in the pleasantries,
[01:41.460 --> 01:44.080]  I had prepared a little photo essay for today,
[01:44.240 --> 01:48.220]  and then it expanded in ways that I did not anticipate.
[01:49.060 --> 01:51.420]  Did it expand due to my recent visit?
[01:52.080 --> 01:53.940]  It might have. That might be a part of it.
[01:54.040 --> 01:55.180]  And I'd like to...
[01:55.940 --> 01:59.980]  So I'd like to begin a story and then pause the story
[01:59.980 --> 02:02.460]  and then come back to the story at the end, if I can.
[02:02.460 --> 02:06.360]  OK. I'd like to play a little game with you guys
[02:06.360 --> 02:10.580]  where I'm going to send some photos out and I'll see if you can tell what's going on.
[02:13.920 --> 02:17.080]  I had to make a special directory on my phone just for all the...
[02:17.080 --> 02:20.140]  First off, I got to let you guys know right now I'm a little loopy.
[02:20.220 --> 02:22.300]  I'm a little tired. I have not been sleeping well.
[02:22.380 --> 02:24.040]  I've been sleeping in my office all week.
[02:25.000 --> 02:26.660]  Oh, no. What?
[02:27.080 --> 02:28.960]  Yeah. We got some bedroom shelves going up.
[02:30.420 --> 02:31.780]  Yeah, we do. We do.
[02:31.780 --> 02:33.480]  We have bedroom shelves going up.
[02:33.580 --> 02:35.640]  And let me show you here.
[02:36.900 --> 02:37.740]  Where's the album?
[02:38.380 --> 02:39.600]  Here we go. You had it all right.
[02:39.640 --> 02:44.420]  So I can't sleep and I can't sleep in my bedroom right now because of this.
[02:44.600 --> 02:48.160]  We're getting we're getting shit put on the wall.
[02:48.280 --> 02:49.600]  I don't know what to call that wall.
[02:51.020 --> 02:53.280]  Wow, that was immensely close.
[02:53.840 --> 02:55.800]  Yeah, you're like trim done.
[02:55.940 --> 02:57.980]  Trim, like wall, like ornate wall trim.
[02:58.100 --> 02:59.000]  Now it's not going to be white.
[02:59.120 --> 02:59.860]  I sent you guys a photo.
[02:59.860 --> 03:00.720]  It's a blue dark.
[03:00.820 --> 03:02.900]  So the color is called Bedroom Boudoir.
[03:03.100 --> 03:04.020]  It's a very dark blue.
[03:04.520 --> 03:05.700]  It's been that color forever.
[03:06.240 --> 03:09.740]  But I'm getting I wanted to get those added in to fancy it up
[03:09.740 --> 03:11.420]  and to really make it pop. Yeah.
[03:11.420 --> 03:13.780]  Like Nick said, so that'll be all the same color.
[03:13.880 --> 03:15.960]  It won't be so so it won't stand out as much.
[03:16.140 --> 03:19.280]  And my ceiling has a bunch of like popcorn on it.
[03:19.320 --> 03:24.180]  Not exactly popcorn, but like 90s weird texture that's just so fucking gross.
[03:24.180 --> 03:26.340]  And every night when I fall to sleep, the last thing I see is
[03:26.720 --> 03:29.360]  a really bad decision somebody made in the mid 90s.
[03:30.460 --> 03:34.900]  And so while we decided to fix the walls and do that at the same time,
[03:34.940 --> 03:37.080]  so they're like removing all the texture from the ceiling
[03:37.080 --> 03:39.600]  and then they're going to paint it the same color as the walls.
[03:39.740 --> 03:41.540]  So my bedroom will be like a sex cave.
[03:43.040 --> 03:44.580]  And I'm pretty jazzed about it.
[03:44.600 --> 03:46.900]  But because of that, everything that lived in my bedroom
[03:46.900 --> 03:48.080]  has to be everywhere else in my house.
[03:48.160 --> 03:51.860]  So my king sized bed is I'm currently backed up against it
[03:51.860 --> 03:53.460]  in in the library right now.
[03:53.680 --> 03:56.480]  So for a while, we had like 40 episodes where I was doing the podcast
[03:56.480 --> 03:58.260]  from my bedroom. Now the bedroom came to me.
[03:58.760 --> 04:00.520]  Hmm. And quite uncomfortable.
[04:00.860 --> 04:04.860]  You realize how different the temperature is from room to room in an old house.
[04:05.580 --> 04:08.880]  Oh, yeah. It's way hotter on this side, on Millie's side of the house than my side.
[04:08.940 --> 04:10.720]  I get what she's been bitching about for so long.
[04:13.240 --> 04:14.380]  So I'm a little out.
[04:14.560 --> 04:16.140]  I'm a little out of sorts because of that.
[04:16.400 --> 04:18.400]  Let me send you the next photo.
[04:18.480 --> 04:20.140]  And this is where the game begins.
[04:20.540 --> 04:23.360]  OK, and I should just say anyone who wants to follow along,
[04:23.380 --> 04:25.600]  if you watch on our YouTube or the Rooster Teeth site,
[04:25.620 --> 04:27.200]  you will see the photos as they pop in.
[04:27.200 --> 04:29.800]  They will also be posted on our social media feeds.
[04:30.220 --> 04:31.560]  There's a. Yes, absolutely.
[04:31.740 --> 04:32.960]  Please play along that.
[04:33.060 --> 04:34.420]  That's a photo you guys will see.
[04:34.560 --> 04:35.620]  It's a it's a me and Emily.
[04:36.600 --> 04:42.200]  I look unhappy, but that's not for any reason other than I take bad photos.
[04:42.380 --> 04:43.800]  And so I make that face in every photo.
[04:43.960 --> 04:48.000]  I figure if I get ahead of it and I own the bad photo, then it becomes me.
[04:48.100 --> 04:48.600]  It's my thing.
[04:48.600 --> 04:51.060]  And so Emily looks beautiful and I look constipated.
[04:51.400 --> 04:52.380]  That's by design.
[04:53.820 --> 04:55.800]  So guess what we're doing there?
[04:56.360 --> 04:57.620]  And then here's the next.
[04:57.980 --> 04:59.060]  Here's the next photo.
[04:59.520 --> 05:00.900]  See if you can. This is the mystery.
[05:01.220 --> 05:02.900]  What do you think is going on in this photo?
[05:07.610 --> 05:09.430]  Huh. What do you think is happening there?
[05:11.690 --> 05:12.050]  Huh.
[05:13.010 --> 05:16.010]  And so, by the way, for audience, if you haven't gone on the Instagram yet,
[05:16.070 --> 05:20.050]  it's a photo of a of a table with two empty chairs.
[05:20.290 --> 05:24.810]  And then there's a group of people sitting at a table in the in the background.
[05:24.810 --> 05:28.930]  For Andrew, Eric and Nick, I, I know what he's gone for here.
[05:28.990 --> 05:31.230]  I'm wondering if you guys can figure out.
[05:31.370 --> 05:32.910]  No cheating. I'm trying to. I'm trying to.
[05:32.990 --> 05:33.830]  Well, is it possible?
[05:34.030 --> 05:37.050]  I'm going to guess that the first photo that you somehow had the cameras
[05:37.050 --> 05:41.130]  reversed potentially that you thought it was forward facing and was facing.
[05:41.570 --> 05:43.150]  OK, you're overthinking it a bit.
[05:43.370 --> 05:47.110]  If anybody else is out, is anybody else want to guess before I just answer it?
[05:47.630 --> 05:48.950]  Nick thinks that was it as well.
[05:49.050 --> 05:50.790]  Yes, Eric, the photos are definitely related.
[05:50.910 --> 05:52.210]  Same same restaurant, same table.
[05:52.210 --> 05:56.330]  If the photos are related, does it have to do the way you described it?
[05:56.450 --> 05:57.990]  Does it have to do with the two empty chairs?
[05:58.510 --> 05:59.770]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:59.790 --> 06:02.390]  You're really you're keying in on on what's going on here.
[06:03.310 --> 06:07.050]  I'm not impact taking a photo of the the group of people behind me.
[06:07.130 --> 06:08.790]  I don't know. And I will never know.
[06:09.130 --> 06:11.430]  I am taking a photo of the two empty chairs.
[06:11.770 --> 06:13.890]  Why would I be taking a photo of two empty chairs?
[06:14.310 --> 06:18.550]  I'm going to say that you're supposed to have a wonderful meal with Gavin
[06:18.550 --> 06:20.770]  and I'd assume Meg.
[06:22.350 --> 06:25.830]  I'm guessing and they no showed would be my guess based off of the clues
[06:25.830 --> 06:26.830]  that we've gathered so far.
[06:27.010 --> 06:34.070]  It is unbelievable that mere days after we have to have a preemptive conversation
[06:35.150 --> 06:39.510]  about having an intervention for someone's goddamn lateness.
[06:39.710 --> 06:43.710]  He no shows me at a double date dinner on a Saturday night.
[06:43.910 --> 06:47.430]  I thought I thought I thought I love this guy.
[06:47.430 --> 06:49.910]  I love his girlfriend, the best friends in the world.
[06:50.030 --> 06:52.370]  I need to spend more time with people. I'm such a hermit.
[06:52.770 --> 06:53.690]  I made the effort.
[06:53.990 --> 06:57.870]  I Emily made a reservation for this Japanese barbecue place
[06:57.870 --> 07:00.270]  where it's kind of like hot pot, but you just like it's like a big hot rock
[07:00.270 --> 07:01.930]  in the middle and you just cook all your food right there.
[07:02.310 --> 07:04.110]  Kind of new. We were excited about it.
[07:04.310 --> 07:07.230]  I texted Gavin on a like a Thursday and I said, hey, I got reservations
[07:07.230 --> 07:09.170]  at 7 p.m. on Saturday for this place.
[07:10.430 --> 07:11.630]  Do you want to go with us?
[07:11.690 --> 07:14.170]  Emily will make the reservations and he's like, we're in.
[07:14.290 --> 07:16.790]  Absolutely. Send them the reservations, the whole thing.
[07:17.230 --> 07:18.630]  Saturday night, seven o'clock.
[07:18.910 --> 07:22.550]  I sit down and I think, oh, fuck, he's not going to show.
[07:22.930 --> 07:23.890]  And Emily's like, what?
[07:23.970 --> 07:25.210]  Has he ever no show dinner before?
[07:25.270 --> 07:29.350]  And I go, no, but I just have a feeling he's not going to show up.
[07:29.770 --> 07:30.730]  And she's like, that's ridiculous.
[07:30.970 --> 07:32.590]  By seven to five, I knew it.
[07:32.890 --> 07:34.930]  So I texted him and I said, hey, buddy.
[07:34.950 --> 07:38.150]  And by about seven or eight, Gavin text back, fuck.
[07:40.190 --> 07:44.630]  Oh. Completely, completely
[07:44.630 --> 07:46.030]  no show at our double dinner.
[07:46.590 --> 07:47.990]  I don't know what's wrong with me.
[07:48.230 --> 07:50.190]  I don't know. I don't know what's going on.
[07:50.310 --> 07:52.150]  This is I've never done that before.
[07:52.390 --> 07:53.950]  So you have no excuse. You just forgot.
[07:54.230 --> 07:55.630]  You just never heard what happened.
[07:56.290 --> 07:58.990]  I guess I just didn't click the thing in the email
[07:58.990 --> 08:00.410]  because I think that makes you a calendared bite.
[08:00.710 --> 08:03.970]  What I did instead was I set a reminder on my phone.
[08:04.450 --> 08:10.030]  But all that does is just put a reminder on my screen when I look at it.
[08:10.290 --> 08:13.350]  It didn't actually go like, hey, dinner tonight.
[08:13.350 --> 08:16.530]  So when I got the text message.
[08:17.390 --> 08:21.270]  Not only did I see Geoff saying, hey, I also saw the reminder just sat there
[08:21.270 --> 08:23.650]  for the exact time that I was looking at.
[08:23.870 --> 08:26.350]  And I was just in like a Home Depot across town.
[08:27.530 --> 08:29.190]  And I was with Meg.
[08:29.310 --> 08:32.550]  We were just getting some stuff and I was just like, oh, no.
[08:32.890 --> 08:34.890]  In the middle of the Home Depot.
[08:35.070 --> 08:35.930]  I was like, no.
[08:36.410 --> 08:38.650]  And she was like, oh, my God, can we make it?
[08:38.670 --> 08:42.950]  I was like, no, we even if we leave right this second, we'll be half an hour late.
[08:43.350 --> 08:46.590]  A complete nightmare.
[08:48.230 --> 08:49.890]  OK, everything's falling apart.
[08:51.030 --> 08:56.330]  I I'm being 100 percent honest when I tell you that I was so fucking happy.
[08:58.190 --> 09:02.550]  Because of this, because I knew you had just given us podcast material,
[09:02.550 --> 09:04.350]  which I infinitely appreciated.
[09:04.470 --> 09:09.010]  Also, as much as I love you and make an opportunity not to talk to people
[09:09.010 --> 09:12.070]  in my life at this point is always greater than an opportunity to talk to people.
[09:12.070 --> 09:13.810]  So it was like totally fine.
[09:13.910 --> 09:14.990]  We had a lovely little dinner.
[09:15.230 --> 09:17.370]  Also, Japanese barbecue where you make your own food.
[09:17.710 --> 09:19.670]  Fucking great. We should all go there together sometimes.
[09:20.270 --> 09:23.210]  I would love to. I was really excited about it.
[09:26.790 --> 09:27.970]  Gavin is slipping.
[09:28.450 --> 09:30.530]  This is a real interesting problem.
[09:30.790 --> 09:34.070]  It's on a much lower scale, but just I wasn't even going to bring it up.
[09:34.170 --> 09:36.970]  But with this story, Gavin texted me yesterday
[09:37.530 --> 09:40.950]  that you're going to you're going to text me back in two hours.
[09:40.950 --> 09:42.630]  Still haven't got a text from Gavin.
[09:42.930 --> 09:46.230]  I think the last episode that aired, we talked about how Ezra
[09:46.230 --> 09:49.350]  made both of us wait like three hours for dinner at different times.
[09:49.570 --> 09:51.390]  And Gavin immediately knows.
[09:52.710 --> 09:57.190]  I think we even set when it's too late to go to the dinner.
[09:57.350 --> 10:00.650]  And I think 30 minutes would have been OK under what we ruled.
[10:00.810 --> 10:01.710]  I think that's on the line.
[10:01.970 --> 10:03.370]  He wouldn't have made it in 30 minutes.
[10:04.170 --> 10:06.250]  In Austin, I was I was on the east side of town.
[10:06.370 --> 10:07.170]  He would have been fucked.
[10:07.730 --> 10:14.730]  Uh, yeah, I mean, I've been I've been busy with like trying to get filming ready.
[10:14.870 --> 10:15.970]  And you know, I got Dan here and stuff.
[10:16.070 --> 10:17.570]  So I'm a little bit more scatterbrained than normal.
[10:17.690 --> 10:18.910]  But that is no excuse.
[10:19.130 --> 10:23.750]  And that is something like a little cheeky double date with Geoff and Emily and Meg.
[10:23.950 --> 10:25.110]  What's better than that in a week?
[10:25.270 --> 10:26.850]  That's like I was looking forward to it.
[10:27.330 --> 10:29.170]  Yeah, me too. There's no reason.
[10:30.530 --> 10:31.330]  I'll tell you this.
[10:31.490 --> 10:34.130]  I had an opportunity the next weekend because this was two weeks ago.
[10:34.650 --> 10:36.310]  Dinner was fucking amazing, Eric.
[10:36.310 --> 10:37.050]  We got to go there sometime.
[10:37.230 --> 10:39.650]  I had an opportunity the next weekend to get dinner,
[10:40.310 --> 10:42.790]  and I invited Trevor and Barbara instead because I knew they'd show up.
[10:42.850 --> 10:43.650]  And they did.
[10:44.030 --> 10:46.110]  They totally showed up. It was fine.
[10:48.570 --> 10:50.010]  I felt I was.
[10:50.070 --> 10:54.170]  And for the record, Gav, listen, out of everybody in the world before.
[10:54.330 --> 10:55.530]  I don't want to beat you up too much.
[10:55.590 --> 10:59.130]  Out of everybody in the world who understands being busy and scatterbrained.
[10:59.570 --> 11:02.510]  It's me. I was not offended in any way.
[11:02.550 --> 11:03.410]  I wasn't upset.
[11:03.710 --> 11:05.290]  You didn't actually hurt my feelings.
[11:05.290 --> 11:08.050]  Emily and I laughed about it for 30 minutes straight.
[11:08.250 --> 11:10.550]  We just joked about how I would talk about it on the podcast.
[11:11.050 --> 11:12.630]  We decided to do this photo thing.
[11:13.130 --> 11:17.110]  It was it became instant instant content, which I love.
[11:17.250 --> 11:19.490]  All I want to do is live in content anyway, right?
[11:19.610 --> 11:20.830]  So I swim around in content.
[11:21.110 --> 11:23.050]  So it was it was 100% fine.
[11:23.710 --> 11:26.190]  Even before we get to the next phase of that story.
[11:26.490 --> 11:29.790]  I just want you to know, irrespective of the second half,
[11:30.990 --> 11:32.610]  it was it was totally OK.
[11:32.690 --> 11:33.450]  And you didn't hurt my feelings.
[11:33.590 --> 11:34.190]  Well, I appreciate it.
[11:34.190 --> 11:37.070]  I mean, obviously I spent the next four hours feeling pretty bad about it.
[11:37.130 --> 11:38.890]  And then most of the next morning, too.
[11:39.270 --> 11:42.330]  But yeah, well, I want you to feel bad for a while, just not forever. Yeah.
[11:44.370 --> 11:45.810]  And I never see Emily either.
[11:46.050 --> 11:49.050]  I'm always like I talk to you every week, but I'm always really excited to talk to Emily
[11:49.550 --> 11:50.790]  because she rules. Yeah, she's great.
[11:50.890 --> 11:52.890]  She's way, way more interesting than I am. Yeah.
[11:54.930 --> 11:56.270]  Hmm. So what came next?
[11:56.630 --> 11:58.230]  Yeah, I'm fascinated to see how this builds.
[11:58.690 --> 12:00.190]  OK, well, we're going to take a pause on that story.
[12:00.270 --> 12:02.110]  I thought the story was over there, but it turns out it wasn't.
[12:02.110 --> 12:04.350]  Today continued to surprise me.
[12:04.810 --> 12:08.850]  First of all, I was going to say also I fully planned to have a working prototype
[12:08.850 --> 12:11.530]  and maybe even a commercial of the fruit gloves for you.
[12:11.590 --> 12:14.890]  But I realized that while there are like.
[12:16.830 --> 12:21.590]  Muscular dudes with more tattoos than me doing carpentry in my bedroom
[12:21.590 --> 12:25.570]  looking way cooler than me, I'm I cannot stand in my kitchen
[12:25.570 --> 12:29.150]  and Velcro a melon baller to the back of my hand.
[12:29.190 --> 12:31.710]  It's just like I just I couldn't do it.
[12:31.710 --> 12:33.010]  I was I felt so like.
[12:33.990 --> 12:37.830]  Dumb and emasculated and like unimportant and like embarrassed.
[12:38.190 --> 12:40.450]  I just I've been hiding in my library all.
[12:42.550 --> 12:43.630]  It's been so lame,
[12:44.450 --> 12:46.330]  which is sucks because it's also where I'm sleeping,
[12:46.390 --> 12:49.770]  so I'm spending like 24 hours a day in.
[12:50.070 --> 12:51.010]  It's like that movie Cube.
[12:51.070 --> 12:53.250]  I cannot get out of this room to save my life.
[12:53.610 --> 12:55.550]  Anyway, so today I decided to go.
[12:56.030 --> 12:58.590]  All I had really prepped for you guys was that.
[12:58.870 --> 13:01.050]  And because I felt bad about not having the fruit gloves.
[13:01.050 --> 13:06.030]  And so I decided to go for a bike ride because sometimes that inspires stories.
[13:06.090 --> 13:09.110]  And I thought, like, maybe I would I would like take you guys along on a journey,
[13:09.110 --> 13:11.390]  on a story with me if I could find some interesting narrative.
[13:12.850 --> 13:16.450]  And it's my you know, my balls are fine now, so I can ride my bike again.
[13:16.470 --> 13:18.130]  Finally, I haven't been because it's been raining,
[13:18.130 --> 13:20.690]  but I was very excited to get out on the new bike.
[13:21.510 --> 13:22.650]  It's fucking awesome.
[13:22.710 --> 13:24.310]  First of all, it's just fucking awesome.
[13:24.630 --> 13:26.710]  Like I cannot say enough good things about this bike.
[13:26.750 --> 13:28.930]  I'm in love with it. I would marry it if I could.
[13:29.670 --> 13:31.510]  It's like the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.
[13:31.570 --> 13:33.730]  I'm completely I've completely got it figured out now.
[13:33.830 --> 13:36.130]  It's so fucking fast, which is a part of the problem.
[13:38.250 --> 13:40.710]  And anyway, so it was just I was having a great time.
[13:41.690 --> 13:45.730]  Stumbled into an amazing situation immediately where I wrote
[13:45.730 --> 13:49.550]  I wrote up on a homeless guy with a big stick who was trying to.
[13:50.410 --> 13:52.810]  I don't know. He was fighting a retaining wall.
[13:53.170 --> 13:55.930]  Like he just kept stabbing it over and over again with the stick.
[13:55.930 --> 13:59.490]  Like he was trying to like trying to puncture this concrete retaining wall.
[13:59.670 --> 14:01.610]  And I thought, well, this is a great photo.
[14:01.730 --> 14:05.250]  But he looked at me and then he just like stared at me as I was writing up on him
[14:05.250 --> 14:07.930]  while he continued to poke the retaining wall and yell at it.
[14:08.050 --> 14:11.010]  And I was like, there's no way I can get around this guy
[14:11.010 --> 14:15.070]  after taking a photo with him and not take take a poke to the eye, you know?
[14:15.650 --> 14:16.470]  Yeah, I was like, fuck it.
[14:16.470 --> 14:18.130]  I guess I guess that's not going to be a part of the story.
[14:18.470 --> 14:21.550]  So I write on I go around Town Lake and
[14:22.630 --> 14:25.070]  I took a photo of how pretty Austin is.
[14:25.530 --> 14:28.230]  And this is this is the kind of the story I stumbled upon.
[14:28.370 --> 14:31.310]  I think a photo of kind of how pretty Austin is not the best photo
[14:31.310 --> 14:33.850]  of how pretty Austin is, but it's just a photo. Here it is.
[14:33.930 --> 14:35.870]  I'm sure you guys for the audience at home.
[14:36.130 --> 14:37.410]  It's just a picture of Town Lake.
[14:37.590 --> 14:39.210]  You can see some of the buildings in the background.
[14:39.350 --> 14:41.050]  There's sun, there's clouds.
[14:41.330 --> 14:44.250]  I'm on the I'm clearly on like the hike and bike trail.
[14:44.750 --> 14:46.270]  Nick loves it down there, as do I.
[14:46.450 --> 14:49.950]  Can you from this photo, can you guys tell what's wrong with Austin?
[14:50.530 --> 14:51.330]  What's wrong with Austin?
[14:51.330 --> 14:53.810]  Is it like the weird layer of scum that's on the lake at the moment?
[14:54.170 --> 14:55.370]  Let's get a little closer.
[14:55.570 --> 14:57.050]  I'm going to zero in on an area.
[14:57.790 --> 14:59.750]  This photo is not too powerful.
[14:59.870 --> 15:01.770]  It's the same fucking photo as all the other photos.
[15:02.150 --> 15:03.010]  How's that possible?
[15:03.250 --> 15:04.990]  All right. Let me see if I can skip that one, do a different one.
[15:05.690 --> 15:08.790]  OK, so here's a photo zoomed in a little bit.
[15:09.950 --> 15:11.310]  Oh, and Jesus.
[15:12.190 --> 15:14.030]  Oh, it's we're not done. Oh, my God.
[15:14.970 --> 15:16.810]  Here is the next.
[15:18.030 --> 15:18.970]  I'm just going to go.
[15:19.730 --> 15:20.910]  I'm just going to go with the next four.
[15:22.630 --> 15:26.270]  It's garbage, it looks like everybody likes to come to Austin
[15:26.270 --> 15:29.330]  and have their bachelor parties and their bachelorette parties
[15:29.330 --> 15:30.710]  and have their awesome weekends.
[15:31.570 --> 15:34.430]  And everybody loves to go like paddleboarding or kayaking or canoeing
[15:34.430 --> 15:35.150]  on Lake Austin.
[15:35.330 --> 15:36.010]  I'm here.
[15:36.150 --> 15:38.630]  This is a public service announcement to everybody who wants to visit Austin.
[15:38.750 --> 15:40.310]  Stay off the fucking water, dude.
[15:40.410 --> 15:42.450]  It is gross. It is disgusting.
[15:42.810 --> 15:45.190]  Look at that last photo with the big gulp.
[15:45.490 --> 15:49.430]  It looks like you could walk on that water like that.
[15:49.430 --> 15:50.890]  I've never seen it like that.
[15:51.330 --> 15:54.010]  Well, we just had a lot of rain, so it's worse than usual.
[15:54.410 --> 15:56.970]  But I can tell you because I've been I ride my bike all the time.
[15:57.050 --> 15:58.890]  It's been like this for at least a year.
[16:00.090 --> 16:03.510]  And here's the fucking here's where it gets what really sucks.
[16:04.450 --> 16:07.310]  Look at these. Here's I rolled up on these dudes.
[16:07.490 --> 16:10.510]  And I'm like, oh, check it out. Here's a.
[16:10.670 --> 16:12.750]  It's like down by where all the turtles sit, is it?
[16:12.990 --> 16:14.450]  Well, it's funny you should say that.
[16:14.710 --> 16:15.570]  Here's the next photo.
[16:16.050 --> 16:17.010]  Here's a bunch of turtles.
[16:17.530 --> 16:21.710]  You see this photo of the turtles hanging out on the on the log.
[16:22.430 --> 16:25.190]  They're like, I can I watch those turtles about 10 minutes
[16:25.190 --> 16:26.750]  and I could hear their conversation.
[16:27.050 --> 16:29.430]  The guy in the right's like, hey, man, you jump in.
[16:29.510 --> 16:31.890]  And the guy looks like, fuck you. I'm not going in. You go in.
[16:31.950 --> 16:32.930]  He's like, I'm not going in.
[16:33.090 --> 16:34.190]  I went in first last time.
[16:34.310 --> 16:36.550]  The turtles are daring each other to get in the water.
[16:36.550 --> 16:39.370]  And nobody's brave enough to do it because they fucking know.
[16:39.810 --> 16:43.410]  Then next to the turtles, I saw these fucking guys, ducks.
[16:44.230 --> 16:45.830]  The ducks won't go in the water.
[16:45.830 --> 16:47.910]  They're having the same conversation as the turtles.
[16:48.110 --> 16:51.470]  You go in. Dude, I am not fucking setting foot in that because you're scared.
[16:51.590 --> 16:53.810]  I'm not scared. You go in. I'm not going in.
[16:53.870 --> 16:55.290]  I went in. I'm telling you, dude.
[16:55.570 --> 16:57.490]  They're making us look like dicks in front of the toes.
[16:57.690 --> 16:59.110]  Do you think it's like dicks in front of us?
[16:59.290 --> 17:01.350]  Then this is the ultimate photo right here, huh?
[17:02.210 --> 17:03.990]  A little bit down, I found.
[17:05.450 --> 17:06.370]  Here's a log.
[17:07.010 --> 17:12.010]  Here's a log where the turtles and the birds and the ducks are daring each other.
[17:13.350 --> 17:15.350]  Nobody wants in this fucking water.
[17:15.350 --> 17:16.730]  Because it is gross.
[17:16.930 --> 17:18.750]  And this is why I bring this up.
[17:18.850 --> 17:19.770]  I just I was horrified.
[17:19.970 --> 17:22.270]  And I think it was just fucking the grossest thing I've ever seen.
[17:22.810 --> 17:24.930]  And everybody talks about how beautiful Austin is this weekend.
[17:25.150 --> 17:29.310]  Actually, tomorrow for every Friday, Saturday and Sunday in Austin,
[17:29.610 --> 17:36.210]  I guarantee you it's going to Town Lake is going to look like this in 24 hours.
[17:36.830 --> 17:37.590]  That's a picture.
[17:37.870 --> 17:40.270]  If you haven't seen it at home, it's called Party Island.
[17:40.530 --> 17:42.570]  It's where all the stand up paddle boards get together
[17:42.570 --> 17:46.630]  and they build a little island where they all drink and enjoy the sun
[17:46.630 --> 17:49.490]  and smoke weed and stuff that doesn't look fun.
[17:50.410 --> 17:53.610]  If you for the audience who may not be looking, it's got to be,
[17:53.950 --> 17:58.010]  I'm guessing, 500 paddle boards and canoes all sandwiched together
[17:58.010 --> 18:01.450]  on the body of the same body of water where all those ducks
[18:01.450 --> 18:06.430]  in the where the ducks, the birds and the fucking turtles are too scared to go in.
[18:07.590 --> 18:12.230]  Every fucking day I read, by the way, also the Austin water is so gross
[18:12.230 --> 18:14.130]  right now, dogs aren't supposed to go in it.
[18:14.430 --> 18:17.930]  There's toxic algae that will kill dogs every day when I ride my bike.
[18:18.070 --> 18:21.450]  I see assholes throw in their fucking balls in the water for the golden retrievers.
[18:21.730 --> 18:23.170]  These people are killing their dogs.
[18:23.270 --> 18:24.370]  It's driving me nuts.
[18:25.350 --> 18:27.030]  And also that toxic algae.
[18:27.150 --> 18:30.730]  There's another kind of algae that if you touch it, it gives you your entire body
[18:30.730 --> 18:34.550]  a rash. And all these people are reporting on Reddit and on Instagram.
[18:34.550 --> 18:35.770]  They're like, what's happening to me?
[18:35.790 --> 18:37.250]  I broke out in a rash.
[18:37.290 --> 18:40.450]  I don't know. After I went paddle boarding, stay out of that fucking water, dude.
[18:40.670 --> 18:41.650]  It is hideous.
[18:41.650 --> 18:42.630]  It is gross.
[18:43.030 --> 18:46.150]  That's my public service announcement to anybody who wants to visit Austin and get
[18:46.150 --> 18:49.450]  on a stand up paddle board or rent a canoe because you think Town Lake is cool.
[18:49.610 --> 18:52.110]  It was at some point, but it hasn't been in a long time.
[18:52.410 --> 18:54.670]  It is a toxic wasteland.
[18:55.050 --> 18:57.190]  Do you think maybe you got jock itch from that?
[18:57.270 --> 18:59.570]  I was about to say, dude, maybe I did.
[18:59.730 --> 19:01.010]  That's a great point.
[19:01.330 --> 19:05.030]  I don't think I don't think that that's a I'm surprised you haven't made that
[19:05.030 --> 19:07.670]  connection. I did it until just now.
[19:07.670 --> 19:12.910]  One turtle got jock itch, Geoff, and the entire animal kingdom refuses to get in.
[19:13.130 --> 19:14.510]  I think it's all connected.
[19:15.130 --> 19:16.370]  Still reeling from jock itch.
[19:16.450 --> 19:18.770]  I mean, my jock itch came would have come from the other side of the dam.
[19:18.890 --> 19:20.890]  Well, Parton Springs. God damn it.
[19:21.190 --> 19:23.610]  Yeah, well, I fucking learned from my mistakes.
[19:24.590 --> 19:27.630]  Keep your genitals away from Austin water.
[19:29.410 --> 19:32.170]  You you just gave a public service
[19:32.170 --> 19:36.190]  announcement for yourself without realizing you're the person who did it.
[19:36.270 --> 19:36.650]  Yes.
[19:37.130 --> 19:38.970]  Because that's the situation.
[19:39.730 --> 19:41.850]  If there's anything that funnels splashes
[19:41.850 --> 19:46.630]  of water down the side of your thighs towards your groin, it's a jet ski.
[19:46.650 --> 19:47.610]  That's the ultimate.
[19:48.370 --> 19:50.770]  It's the ultimate scrub rub splash device.
[19:52.010 --> 19:55.990]  You did all of that to warn people not to do the thing that you did.
[19:56.450 --> 19:57.710]  Yeah, I learned from my mistakes.
[19:58.070 --> 19:58.870]  For fuck's sake.
[19:59.270 --> 20:00.770]  Dude, that is disgusting.
[20:00.950 --> 20:04.050]  I want to rent a boat with like a net and try and get some of that up.
[20:04.610 --> 20:06.430]  Like a face river cleanup.
[20:06.670 --> 20:08.110]  Oh, no, let me do it.
[20:08.350 --> 20:09.830]  There's no way you could do that.
[20:09.890 --> 20:11.350]  You would vomit so fast.
[20:11.790 --> 20:14.110]  Yeah, there's there's not enough trash cans on Earth, dude.
[20:14.630 --> 20:18.850]  It's and I recognize that we just had a major, major rain and it's dumping a lot
[20:18.850 --> 20:22.210]  of trash into the water, but I promise you it looked like that last week, too.
[20:22.310 --> 20:22.650]  It's not.
[20:23.810 --> 20:25.370]  Yeah, I've been noticing that
[20:26.330 --> 20:30.410]  recently just going over the bridge, I noticed that sort of trash island further
[20:30.410 --> 20:33.490]  in the middle. Yeah, it was just floating in the center a few weeks ago.
[20:33.490 --> 20:37.190]  And I don't know if it's the the five hundred thousand people that moved to
[20:37.190 --> 20:41.570]  Austin in the last 90 days or what, but I'm not I'm not trying to be one of those
[20:41.570 --> 20:45.670]  people, but just just stay out of the fucking water because it's gross and
[20:45.670 --> 20:47.790]  dangerous and keep your pets away from it.
[20:48.090 --> 20:50.250]  The ducks don't want anything to do with our water.
[20:50.650 --> 20:51.970]  Your dog shouldn't either.
[20:53.190 --> 20:54.490]  That's a nice public safety.
[20:55.030 --> 20:56.270]  Yeah, that's my that's my little story.
[20:56.330 --> 20:57.990]  That's the only story I stumbled upon on my bike.
[20:58.070 --> 21:00.290]  Oh, oh. So then I take all those photos.
[21:00.390 --> 21:02.350]  I come around, I head I start heading home.
[21:02.350 --> 21:08.850]  The it's it's probably an hour later at this point from when I drove past the crazy
[21:08.850 --> 21:10.410]  guy poking the stick at the retaining wall.
[21:10.790 --> 21:12.510]  I probably I've done a full loop around
[21:12.510 --> 21:14.790]  Town Lake, down to the dam, all the way back up to the other end.
[21:14.890 --> 21:16.710]  And I stopped to take photos a bunch and
[21:17.390 --> 21:20.770]  like give my condolences to the the fucking ducks and the turtles.
[21:22.870 --> 21:27.990]  And guess who I see in the exact same spot doing the exact same thing.
[21:28.230 --> 21:30.890]  The homeless guy is still trying to kill
[21:30.890 --> 21:32.850]  the retaining wall with the giant stick.
[21:33.490 --> 21:36.010]  And when I roll up on him, I'm pretty far away from him.
[21:36.430 --> 21:37.750]  He's already looking at me.
[21:37.890 --> 21:40.890]  He's doing the same thing where his his it's his right arm is just like
[21:40.890 --> 21:43.330]  robotically poking it and he's like yelling.
[21:43.670 --> 21:46.750]  It might be some sort of an incantation or spell under his breath.
[21:46.870 --> 21:48.910]  And he's just staring at me the whole time.
[21:49.170 --> 21:52.370]  Man, let me tell you, that was I don't often get intimidated,
[21:52.690 --> 21:55.330]  but I didn't enjoy having to drive past that dude in that moment.
[21:55.690 --> 21:57.730]  It I mean, I did and I was fine.
[21:57.830 --> 22:00.370]  He didn't attack because you don't know what he's thinking because I don't know
[22:00.370 --> 22:05.410]  what he's thinking and he's displayed an aggression towards inanimate objects on.
[22:05.510 --> 22:06.830]  And I'm way more flashy.
[22:07.010 --> 22:07.570]  I'm moving.
[22:08.390 --> 22:09.430]  There's a lot more to look at.
[22:09.510 --> 22:11.230]  I'm more colorful than a retaining wall.
[22:11.570 --> 22:12.190]  It's way easy.
[22:12.330 --> 22:13.730]  Like, I feel like I would catch his attention.
[22:14.130 --> 22:16.890]  Like he's obviously transfixed and hates this concrete.
[22:17.330 --> 22:18.730]  I don't know what he would do to me. Right.
[22:19.070 --> 22:21.550]  So anyway, once again, did not take a photo
[22:21.550 --> 22:23.810]  of this dude because I'm pretty sure he would have killed me.
[22:24.350 --> 22:26.030]  And then we'd be you guys would be
[22:26.030 --> 22:29.010]  fucking you guys would be right now trying to put a podcast together,
[22:29.010 --> 22:32.790]  making fun of me for being 20 minutes late to my own podcast.
[22:32.890 --> 22:35.650]  And I'm late because I'm either dead or in the emergency room.
[22:36.330 --> 22:37.330]  Boy, would you feel bad?
[22:39.730 --> 22:43.230]  Anyway, so then the last piece, what I thought was the last piece, I thought that was it.
[22:43.310 --> 22:44.650]  I thought that was where my photos I was going to share with you.
[22:44.710 --> 22:47.370]  I'm going to share one more with you that happened on the way home.
[22:47.770 --> 22:50.910]  That's the owie I got from the first bike wreck on my new bike.
[22:51.090 --> 22:53.610]  Oh, is that your knee?
[22:53.910 --> 22:55.290]  It's a stinger, dude.
[22:55.330 --> 22:56.730]  It's my knee. Yeah.
[22:57.150 --> 22:57.910]  Did you come off?
[22:58.370 --> 23:05.530]  Oh, yeah, I fucked my... I'm not even gonna be brave, dude.
[23:05.790 --> 23:09.830]  I sniffled a little bit when I did it.
[23:10.250 --> 23:11.470]  Oh, God.
[23:12.050 --> 23:14.490]  I was like I was going like maybe 12 or 14
[23:14.490 --> 23:19.290]  miles an hour and I was crossing a four way and I was actually in a bike lane.
[23:19.410 --> 23:22.250]  But you know how like like that's like raised curbs.
[23:22.470 --> 23:24.630]  I just I guess I was just like.
[23:25.450 --> 23:27.550]  Just going a little too close to the curb
[23:27.550 --> 23:31.190]  and you know how like sometimes if you're like you're turning hard and your your
[23:31.190 --> 23:34.510]  pedal might hit the ground and it'll just scrape and like a little bit and you keep
[23:34.510 --> 23:37.390]  going. Well, that kind of happened, but it was with the curb.
[23:37.490 --> 23:39.230]  Except I guess I was going fast enough.
[23:39.550 --> 23:42.530]  And and the pedal must have just got
[23:43.850 --> 23:48.930]  hooked into the curb so that my whole bike just hit it and did an immediate left
[23:48.930 --> 23:53.930]  turn, like the whole thing just swung around like on a stripper pole and sent
[23:53.930 --> 23:57.870]  the right half of my body one way and the left half of my body on the other way.
[23:57.990 --> 24:03.670]  And I landed I landed on my knee right there with my body pushed to the right.
[24:03.750 --> 24:06.370]  So I sprained my knee to the right brutally.
[24:06.590 --> 24:10.390]  But as I was doing that, it was the momentum was pulling me away.
[24:10.530 --> 24:13.050]  So my legs shot out the other direction.
[24:13.090 --> 24:16.570]  And so my left ankle got sprained going left.
[24:16.710 --> 24:19.330]  So like I've got a right sprain on my left
[24:19.330 --> 24:23.230]  knee and a left sprain on my left ankle, so it's almost impossible to walk.
[24:23.230 --> 24:27.370]  It hurts like there's no there's nothing I can favor, you know, like if I go like,
[24:27.530 --> 24:29.530]  oh, I'll just walk on the left a little bit and it just hurts the knee.
[24:29.570 --> 24:30.810]  If I go, I'll walk on the right a little bit.
[24:30.870 --> 24:31.390]  It hurts the ankle.
[24:32.170 --> 24:34.690]  Also, the one thing I'm trying not to do
[24:34.690 --> 24:41.250]  right now is cause too much damage to my balls because I'm barely four weeks past
[24:41.250 --> 24:46.170]  the the vasectomy, I racked my balls so fucking hard on my bike.
[24:46.450 --> 24:51.770]  I saw purple like the world went purple for a second just from the ball pain.
[24:51.770 --> 24:56.950]  I had to get over the ball pain before I could even assess my knee and my leg.
[24:57.190 --> 24:58.690]  And then I had to ride my bike home.
[24:58.790 --> 25:00.010]  It fucking hurt.
[25:00.170 --> 25:03.170]  And it hurts to sit on. Did you not hit the bar in the middle of the bike?
[25:03.670 --> 25:04.770]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25:06.590 --> 25:08.210]  Yeah, dude, I almost like,
[25:08.910 --> 25:12.570]  you know how like your balls are connected to your tongue all the way through your body?
[25:13.350 --> 25:18.890]  Like I hit my balls so fucking hard, I could feel like my throat was trying to eat my tongue.
[25:20.290 --> 25:22.390]  It hurts so bad.
[25:23.150 --> 25:24.970]  It's reeling your tongue down your throat.
[25:25.350 --> 25:29.550]  Yeah. And then and then as that subsided a little bit and I realized that I probably
[25:29.550 --> 25:32.510]  hadn't like broken my dick in some way that I needed to go to the emergency room for
[25:32.510 --> 25:37.710]  to get, you know, reaffixed, all the fucking leg pain really, really hit me.
[25:38.810 --> 25:42.710]  So knocked that out, got past my first bike rack on the new bike.
[25:42.770 --> 25:44.290]  The bike did swimmingly well, by the way.
[25:44.390 --> 25:45.930]  It didn't even, not a scratch on it.
[25:45.930 --> 25:48.890]  I think my body took all of the scratches.
[25:50.370 --> 25:51.690]  So I thought that was the end.
[25:52.050 --> 25:54.050]  I thought that was the end of of my photo.
[25:54.150 --> 25:54.990]  So I thought, like, oh, cool.
[25:55.030 --> 25:58.150]  I get one more photo out of the day for these guys that I can share with them.
[25:58.270 --> 26:01.950]  And then before you move on, what was what's now the integrity of your ankle?
[26:02.230 --> 26:03.390]  Because obviously Andrew's a hundred.
[26:03.490 --> 26:04.730]  Yeah, I'd love to hear. Yeah.
[26:04.970 --> 26:06.650]  As somebody who's a hundred at the current moment.
[26:06.750 --> 26:07.190]  What's your ankle?
[26:07.410 --> 26:10.690]  I would say my knee is at like 60 percent maybe.
[26:11.010 --> 26:13.470]  And my ankle is at like 35 percent.
[26:13.470 --> 26:17.130]  Yeah, like I'm pretty I'm pretty hard limping right now.
[26:17.150 --> 26:20.250]  OK, yeah, I can't really bend it.
[26:20.450 --> 26:22.510]  So I'm I'm I'm a little bummed out.
[26:22.630 --> 26:27.610]  I'm bummed out because I hate to see Austin look gross.
[26:27.770 --> 26:28.810]  I hate my city to be gross.
[26:29.070 --> 26:33.430]  I hate that I rode around my favorite spot for 45 or two hours today.
[26:33.490 --> 26:40.510]  And I was just assaulted by the smell of like fucking gross trash and mildew and
[26:41.430 --> 26:44.290]  like human feces and stale booze.
[26:44.370 --> 26:46.990]  And it just it was so fucking gross that it was really it was a real bummer.
[26:47.950 --> 26:50.550]  And for those of you people that are like, well, if you if you hate it so much,
[26:50.610 --> 26:51.150]  do something about it.
[26:51.430 --> 26:54.450]  I go and pick up trash in my neighborhood park like three times a month.
[26:55.010 --> 26:58.570]  I try to do I do try to do my part anyway.
[26:58.690 --> 27:03.150]  So I get home feeling a little dejected and pretty sore and bummed that I got to go
[27:03.150 --> 27:07.790]  hide in my library next to my bed where I have like one inch to move around
[27:08.610 --> 27:12.010]  because I'm definitely not feeling like a cool guy that wants to hang out in his
[27:12.010 --> 27:16.510]  house around a bunch of way cooler dudes who are doing hard work that I'm paying
[27:16.510 --> 27:18.450]  him to do while I fucking hide like a troll.
[27:19.650 --> 27:21.010]  And this was on my front door.
[27:22.170 --> 27:22.850]  Oh, huh.
[27:23.010 --> 27:24.790]  And then I got a text from Gavin that said,
[27:26.050 --> 27:27.030]  you have a package.
[27:27.810 --> 27:28.730]  So I was like, what?
[27:28.810 --> 27:30.770]  I went to that and then here.
[27:30.990 --> 27:33.890]  So here's I wanted to get my I wanted to get the full story.
[27:33.990 --> 27:35.050]  So here's my face.
[27:35.630 --> 27:39.430]  Uh, I want Gavin, I wanted you to see my my actual reaction.
[27:39.770 --> 27:44.930]  So here's my face when I realized that you sent me flowers and a gold, a gold,
[27:45.330 --> 27:46.610]  sort of a golden package.
[27:46.950 --> 27:48.790]  I was like, I was like, what?
[27:49.450 --> 27:50.070]  Yeah, that's me.
[27:51.090 --> 27:54.470]  So then I open it up and there's a fucking I won't show you
[27:54.470 --> 27:55.850]  the inside of the card because it's very personal.
[27:57.990 --> 28:00.950]  Well, it's not that personal, but it sounds cooler if I say that
[28:01.570 --> 28:06.050]  there's a card that says face guilt basket, which I thought was really sweet.
[28:06.270 --> 28:07.990]  And I really, really, really sweet.
[28:08.190 --> 28:11.310]  And then inside of it was
[28:12.150 --> 28:14.630]  not just the flowers, the roses and stuff.
[28:15.650 --> 28:18.650]  Gavin and Meg also got us Tiff's Treats,
[28:18.650 --> 28:20.850]  which is a local awesome cookie company that everybody loves.
[28:21.130 --> 28:26.050]  And my favorite ice cream, Cookie Two Step, Blue Bell, Cookie Two Step.
[28:26.350 --> 28:29.650]  I couldn't believe you remembered and you got my favorite ice cream.
[28:29.650 --> 28:31.070]  I fucking love you for that.
[28:31.370 --> 28:36.930]  I also I the Tiff's Treats came with a little jar of milk and I made sure to remove
[28:36.930 --> 28:38.830]  that because you hate it. Thank you, buddy.
[28:40.030 --> 28:41.410]  I do hate milk.
[28:41.570 --> 28:45.630]  And then I realized that the ice cream and the cookies were sitting on top
[28:45.630 --> 28:47.510]  of something and I thought it was just like padding.
[28:47.710 --> 28:49.730]  But I took the rest of the box apart
[28:49.730 --> 28:52.850]  and they were hiding this, which I guess was the real gift.
[28:57.200 --> 29:01.160]  You gave Geoff a PS5 because you missed your dinner.
[29:01.160 --> 29:03.280]  Gavin bought me a PS5.
[29:03.400 --> 29:06.000]  I haven't owned a PlayStation since the PS2.
[29:06.540 --> 29:07.680]  I can't believe it.
[29:07.920 --> 29:08.900]  I'm so excited.
[29:09.180 --> 29:11.620]  Look, I thought I would hit the gilt basket hard.
[29:11.700 --> 29:12.580]  I thought I'd go all out.
[29:13.000 --> 29:15.160]  Nick said to Gavin, do you want to go to dinner?
[29:17.480 --> 29:21.340]  I thought I don't want you to not invite me to dinner again because my,
[29:21.520 --> 29:23.580]  my, you know, integrity is falling apart.
[29:23.940 --> 29:25.020]  So here's a little make good.
[29:25.360 --> 29:28.100]  And also this was a double whammy for me
[29:28.100 --> 29:31.540]  because I remember a time, obviously, you're not a PlayStation guy.
[29:32.060 --> 29:33.120]  You're a massive Xbox guy.
[29:33.700 --> 29:37.140]  And I remember a time when Bernie gave you a PS3 and you were annoyed.
[29:39.260 --> 29:42.780]  Back in the day, like maybe like 14 years ago or something,
[29:43.120 --> 29:47.820]  you just had a PS3 on your desk and you were like annoyed, moving it, unplugging it.
[29:48.000 --> 29:51.300]  So I thought, I wonder if you have the same reaction to a PS5.
[29:51.880 --> 29:52.980]  No, it meant the world to me.
[29:53.200 --> 29:54.540]  Actually, here's my actual reaction.
[29:54.620 --> 29:56.620]  I took another photo after the PS5.
[29:57.140 --> 29:58.560]  That's my final photo.
[29:58.960 --> 30:00.840]  That's my that's my PS5 face.
[30:01.080 --> 30:03.000]  No, it's fucking it's incredibly sweet.
[30:03.060 --> 30:04.780]  I needed it. I love it.
[30:04.840 --> 30:09.080]  I've thought about buying one a few times because people keep telling me that I
[30:09.080 --> 30:13.260]  specifically would love Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West or whatever.
[30:13.960 --> 30:16.340]  And you fucking you got it for me.
[30:16.400 --> 30:19.840]  And now, like, dude, I was actually thinking, like, I'm never going to be a
[30:19.840 --> 30:22.960]  streamer, but if I ever was, I was trying to figure out what my angle would be.
[30:22.960 --> 30:27.900]  And I thought, like, maybe my my my streaming angle could be I play all the
[30:27.900 --> 30:33.520]  PlayStation games that I've never played, Uncharted, God of War, fucking I don't
[30:33.520 --> 30:36.280]  know, there's probably others, the Spider-Man game everybody loved.
[30:37.180 --> 30:38.840]  What other big Sony properties?
[30:38.920 --> 30:42.020]  Other Gran Turismo, I guess? Ghost of Tsushima.
[30:42.220 --> 30:43.380]  Yeah, that's everybody loves that game.
[30:44.900 --> 30:47.380]  And now I can now I have access to all this.
[30:48.760 --> 30:52.480]  You've opened my world up, Gavin, and I thank you so much.
[30:52.480 --> 30:54.440]  I I really appreciate it.
[30:54.440 --> 30:55.620]  You have no idea how much it means.
[30:55.760 --> 30:58.060]  You're welcome. It's incredibly generous.
[30:58.200 --> 30:58.920]  This is a wonderful thing.
[30:59.300 --> 31:01.300]  I think my favorite part of it is if you
[31:01.300 --> 31:05.900]  look at the first photo where it is, like on the doorstep, it kind of looks like
[31:05.900 --> 31:10.460]  they used a tablecloth from a restaurant, like it really ties it all together.
[31:10.660 --> 31:12.240]  Like the bagginess of it.
[31:12.280 --> 31:14.400]  I just see tablecloth from it all.
[31:14.500 --> 31:15.620]  It works perfectly.
[31:16.120 --> 31:16.440]  I don't know.
[31:16.560 --> 31:20.360]  You don't really get from these pictures is the fact that on the way to deliver it,
[31:21.060 --> 31:25.540]  Meg took quite a harsh left turn and it all went flying across the car and all
[31:25.540 --> 31:29.800]  the water from the flowers spilled across the back seats and on the PlayStation.
[31:30.920 --> 31:32.620]  So you may need to top up that vase.
[31:32.900 --> 31:34.380]  But I'll definitely top up the vase.
[31:34.600 --> 31:36.840]  Other than that, I think it all got there in one piece.
[31:37.660 --> 31:37.860]  That's fantastic.
[31:37.860 --> 31:41.500]  But did she make a harsh left turn to dodge the dude who wrecked his bicycle?
[31:43.920 --> 31:47.740]  And I think this works for you because, you know, you're the first recipient
[31:47.740 --> 31:53.000]  of my guilt basket, and it also works for me in that I've now set that as a standard
[31:53.000 --> 31:57.320]  for me missing an event and I don't want to have to go through buying all this shit
[31:57.320 --> 32:02.420]  every time, keep me on my toes, keep me on time and keep me in attendance.
[32:02.800 --> 32:05.940]  Well, here's what I can recommend to anybody who listens to this podcast.
[32:06.720 --> 32:09.560]  Make every opportunity you can to make plans with Gavin.
[32:12.520 --> 32:15.860]  Every opportunity you have, make plans with Gavin and don't be
[32:15.860 --> 32:17.380]  one of those people who nags him and reminds him.
[32:17.380 --> 32:19.540]  I actually thought on Saturday in the middle of the day,
[32:19.640 --> 32:22.820]  I thought I just sent Gavin a text like, can't wait for tonight.
[32:23.160 --> 32:24.600]  You know, looking forward to hanging out.
[32:24.820 --> 32:26.060]  And I thought, nah, that's lame.
[32:27.000 --> 32:29.720]  And it turns out it was lame because it got me a PS5.
[32:30.460 --> 32:34.140]  And I figured if you if if it'll just sit and rot behind your TV,
[32:34.220 --> 32:35.780]  you could just give it to Billy or give it to somebody like.
[32:36.000 --> 32:37.240]  No, dude, I'm gonna play the dick side of it.
[32:37.280 --> 32:38.220]  Are you kidding? Thank you so much.
[32:38.680 --> 32:39.040]  It's awesome.
[32:39.220 --> 32:41.660]  I actually I made a friend recently who is
[32:41.660 --> 32:43.960]  a PlayStation gamer and was like, we could play games together.
[32:43.960 --> 32:45.320]  And I was like, yeah, but I don't own a PlayStation.
[32:45.620 --> 32:47.100]  Now I can play video games with him.
[32:47.380 --> 32:47.940]  That's perfect.
[32:52.820 --> 32:55.400]  What's holding you back from the ultimate gaming experience?
[32:56.100 --> 32:58.340]  Is it the hundreds of dollars it costs for your setup?
[32:58.680 --> 33:01.460]  Or are you the busy on the go type with only minutes to spare?
[33:02.080 --> 33:05.420]  Level up your game with Backbone, the universal gaming essential
[33:05.420 --> 33:08.440]  that it instantly enhances your gaming experience on mobile.
[33:09.220 --> 33:12.900]  Backbone just released a PlayStation edition of their beloved Backbone One.
[33:13.260 --> 33:16.500]  The officially licensed controller for PlayStation was brought to life
[33:16.500 --> 33:19.580]  in collaboration with PlayStation's design team.
[33:19.580 --> 33:23.260]  The elegant colors, materials and finishes are all inspired
[33:23.260 --> 33:27.500]  by the design of the PS5 DualSense controller, all the way down
[33:27.500 --> 33:31.640]  to the transparent face buttons and its visually distinctive floating appearance.
[33:32.220 --> 33:36.100]  Simply plug in your iPhone to the Backbone and enjoy console quality
[33:36.100 --> 33:41.000]  controls as you play console games via remote play or cloud streaming services
[33:41.000 --> 33:44.940]  and app store games. Being able to play things like Ghost of Tsushima
[33:44.940 --> 33:46.500]  or Horizon Forbidden West.
[33:46.580 --> 33:49.280]  I mean, there's so many amazing PlayStation titles on the go.
[33:49.580 --> 33:52.380]  As well as mobile, like Call of Duty mobile, like there's so many great games.
[33:52.680 --> 33:57.380]  Having an amazing controller mimic the physical controller experience you have.
[33:57.540 --> 33:59.200]  But on the go, it's fantastic.
[33:59.360 --> 34:00.220]  Backbone is great.

[35:48.740 --> 35:53.320]  A few decades ago, private citizens used to be largely that, private.
[35:54.000 --> 35:55.880]  What's changed? The Internet.
[35:56.340 --> 35:59.920]  Think about everything you've browsed, searched for, watched or tweeted.
[36:00.160 --> 36:03.000]  Now imagine all that data being crawled through, collected
[36:03.000 --> 36:07.320]  and aggregated by third parties into a permanent public record.
[36:07.600 --> 36:10.740]  Your record, having your private life exposed for others
[36:10.740 --> 36:14.080]  to see what was once something only celebrities worried about.
[36:14.300 --> 36:19.000]  But in an era where everyone is online, everyone is a public figure.
[36:19.400 --> 36:22.720]  To keep my data private, when I go online, I turn to ExpressVPN.
[36:23.180 --> 36:25.820]  Did you know there are hundreds of data brokers out there
[36:25.820 --> 36:28.700]  whose sole business is to buy and sell your data?
[36:29.260 --> 36:32.120]  The worst part is they don't have to tell you who they're selling it to
[36:32.120 --> 36:33.500]  to get your consent.
[36:34.300 --> 36:36.500]  One of these data points is your IP address.
[36:36.960 --> 36:41.140]  Data harvesters use your IP to uniquely identify you and your location.
[36:41.380 --> 36:45.980]  But with ExpressVPN, my connection gets rerouted through an encrypted server
[36:45.980 --> 36:48.120]  and my IP address is masked.
[36:48.600 --> 36:50.240]  Look at that. What a great feature. Masking.
[36:50.300 --> 36:52.260]  I love when a thing is masked. Keeps me private.
[36:52.740 --> 36:56.460]  Every time I turn ExpressVPN on, I'm given a random IP address
[36:56.460 --> 36:58.900]  shared by other ExpressVPN customers.
[36:59.140 --> 37:01.980]  That makes it more difficult for third parties to identify me
[37:02.120 --> 37:03.300]  and harvest my data.
[37:04.020 --> 37:07.400]  And the best part is how easy ExpressVPN is to use.
[37:07.760 --> 37:11.000]  No matter what device you're on, phone, laptop or smart TV,
[37:11.440 --> 37:13.300]  all you have to do is tap one button to get protected.
[37:13.640 --> 37:18.040]  So if, like me, you believe that your data is your business,
[37:18.400 --> 37:21.260]  secure yourself with the number one rated VPN on the market.
[37:21.700 --> 37:27.480]  Visit ExpressVPN.com slash face and get three extra months for free.
[37:28.120 --> 37:30.620]  That is ExpressVPN.com slash face.
[37:32.980 --> 37:35.240]  ExpressVPN.com slash face.

[37:39.860 --> 37:43.700]  Well, you're not the only one who has taken a fall recently, Geoff.
[37:44.180 --> 37:46.700]  Oh, my God, I fell.
[37:47.260 --> 37:48.480]  And it was I'm so disappointed.
[37:48.480 --> 37:49.960]  Do we have a new percentage?
[37:50.680 --> 37:52.620]  No, we're good. Everything is fine.
[37:52.960 --> 37:56.260]  It's the photo. I also have a photo or two I'd like to share.
[37:56.260 --> 38:01.620]  So as stated previously, my chair had been broken for months
[38:01.620 --> 38:06.020]  and I continued to use it out of the hope that it would completely collapse
[38:06.020 --> 38:08.140]  while we were recording at one point.
[38:08.480 --> 38:11.360]  It finally it hit its last legs last night.
[38:11.540 --> 38:15.700]  It got to the point where the front part of it was constantly tilted forward.
[38:16.000 --> 38:17.540]  It was so uncomfortable to sit in.
[38:17.900 --> 38:19.220]  But I was just holding out. I was hoping.
[38:19.920 --> 38:23.400]  And last night I dropped something off my desk
[38:23.400 --> 38:28.280]  and I went to pick it up and it snapped again on the forward angle.
[38:28.460 --> 38:30.280]  And I tried to recover by going middle.
[38:30.440 --> 38:32.480]  You know, like Tony Hawk games when you're grinding
[38:32.480 --> 38:35.080]  and you have the balance meter that you're trying to do.
[38:35.220 --> 38:37.900]  It was as soon as I got back to the middle,
[38:38.120 --> 38:42.640]  it immediately shot left and it dumped me so hard.
[38:42.980 --> 38:44.700]  I hit the ground so hard.
[38:44.980 --> 38:46.720]  It is the most broken chair.
[38:47.020 --> 38:49.100]  It looks like an amusement park ride.
[38:49.200 --> 38:50.980]  I'm going to put a photo in the discord right now of the chair.
[38:50.980 --> 38:55.620]  This is the natural position of the chair for this part.
[38:56.120 --> 39:01.280]  It looks like a chair trying to impersonate somebody on like a Disney ride
[39:01.280 --> 39:05.200]  with their hands up, like it's going sideways around the turn with the thing.
[39:05.440 --> 39:06.700]  I ate shit.
[39:07.260 --> 39:10.780]  And I was so disappointed that it was not on the show.
[39:11.320 --> 39:12.220]  I had been hoping for it.
[39:12.580 --> 39:14.840]  After you talked about it breaking last time this has happened.
[39:14.960 --> 39:19.000]  Yes, this was that was it was broken, but I was still making it work.
[39:19.040 --> 39:20.380]  And now I had to go buy a new chair
[39:20.380 --> 39:22.280]  because I cannot... So when did it dump you off?
[39:22.640 --> 39:23.560]  It dumped me yesterday.
[39:23.980 --> 39:25.060]  Oh, OK. Last night.
[39:25.440 --> 39:28.500]  That would have been a great if you and Geoff hit the ground at the same time.
[39:29.880 --> 39:31.960]  Did it dump you at like 7 p.m.
[39:31.960 --> 39:33.500]  or did it dump you at like three in the morning?
[39:33.520 --> 39:35.180]  Oh, it dumped me at like 7 p.m.
[39:35.200 --> 39:36.940]  It was it wasn't like early, early.
[39:37.040 --> 39:39.180]  Yeah. But was it loud enough to alert neighbors?
[39:39.240 --> 39:40.980]  Oh, it was so loud.
[39:41.100 --> 39:43.240]  I'm sure they were alerted. Yeah, for sure.
[39:43.700 --> 39:46.340]  It was it was louder than I think the sushi fall.
[39:46.760 --> 39:48.380]  The impact was was huge.
[39:48.380 --> 39:52.760]  How long did you have to lay on the ground before you decided you could move?
[39:53.400 --> 39:56.500]  I laid on the ground for like two seconds in shock.
[39:56.620 --> 39:59.460]  And then I laughed really hard for about five seconds.
[39:59.480 --> 40:02.200]  And then I just laid there for probably another minute
[40:02.200 --> 40:04.820]  processing how broken the chair was.
[40:06.380 --> 40:07.340]  It's fantastic.
[40:07.560 --> 40:09.140]  I'm really sad that we missed it.
[40:09.220 --> 40:11.880]  All the furniture in your room just jumping like half an inch.
[40:16.200 --> 40:18.020]  So that was my my night.
[40:18.020 --> 40:19.540]  That's a new addition to people.
[40:19.700 --> 40:21.520]  If they want to update the drawing of your room.
[40:21.680 --> 40:22.320]  Yeah, yeah.
[40:22.460 --> 40:27.980]  And I also I feel like I should wrap up the end cap thing
[40:27.980 --> 40:29.300]  because we were doing that. Yeah.
[40:29.420 --> 40:30.540]  Please, please, please.
[40:30.620 --> 40:32.420]  Did we determine whether they were actually end caps?
[40:32.520 --> 40:34.720]  So that's I've we got a whole whole lot to go through.
[40:34.760 --> 40:37.600]  So I completed the challenge and it was really boring.
[40:37.620 --> 40:39.820]  And I feel bad about that. I wish it was more exciting.
[40:39.920 --> 40:43.360]  I just ended up eating chicken and like pasta for a week.
[40:43.460 --> 40:44.480]  It wasn't it was dull.
[40:44.960 --> 40:46.000]  I got incredibly lucky.
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.220]  But the real point of contention, because I was sick,
[40:50.260 --> 40:54.000]  I couldn't go get it myself, was did my mom understand what end caps were?
[40:54.400 --> 40:56.500]  Based off the photos, there's a lot of disagreement.
[40:56.740 --> 40:57.540]  I felt confident.
[40:57.700 --> 41:00.480]  But as we stated, I have salad cream in my DNA.
[41:01.100 --> 41:02.960]  You never know. Can't be confident.
[41:03.520 --> 41:09.460]  So I went grocery shopping yesterday to review the end cap situation.
[41:10.640 --> 41:11.940]  I'm going to take I'm going to take.
[41:12.020 --> 41:15.260]  Should I post the ones that were up for dispute last time as a refresher?
[41:15.260 --> 41:16.600]  Yeah, definitely.
[41:16.920 --> 41:18.400]  So these these were the two.
[41:18.860 --> 41:21.540]  There are three of them, but these are the two I haven't.
[41:21.680 --> 41:24.860]  I need to find because when I went back, I realized how lucky I was
[41:25.460 --> 41:28.760]  when I went the first time there were chickens in the end caps.
[41:29.040 --> 41:32.820]  And that was mainly what I went off of when I went yesterday.
[41:33.440 --> 41:35.120]  Everything was different in the end caps.
[41:35.160 --> 41:38.020]  And I don't think I would have been able to do it if I started this week.
[41:38.260 --> 41:41.320]  Wow. So those were some of the end caps that you guys didn't think were in caps.
[41:41.320 --> 41:45.600]  Here is an alternate view of said end caps,
[41:45.780 --> 41:49.120]  as you can see very clearly in caps.
[41:49.300 --> 41:50.380]  Oh, my. Wow.
[41:50.580 --> 41:51.180]  They're row.
[41:52.180 --> 41:53.780]  Now, the last one.
[41:54.300 --> 41:56.480]  Wow. That was a wider than the aisle.
[41:56.780 --> 41:58.180]  They're very wide. They're huge.
[41:58.240 --> 42:02.380]  You have end caps that are literally wider than the aisles.
[42:02.480 --> 42:06.040]  It's like this grocery store was tailor made for this challenge.
[42:06.540 --> 42:10.560]  They've almost made an aisle that runs the other way down the store
[42:10.560 --> 42:13.220]  because they've never seen anything like this in my life.
[42:13.540 --> 42:14.300]  Yeah, they're fucking massive.
[42:14.520 --> 42:18.760]  And the other one that was up for debate was this, which looks horrendous.
[42:18.840 --> 42:19.740]  Like, I agree. That's gross.
[42:19.920 --> 42:22.820]  Since they moved everything, I couldn't find that specific one.
[42:23.120 --> 42:24.260]  I remember there's a state.
[42:24.420 --> 42:26.220]  Next time I go in there, I'll verify the state.
[42:26.320 --> 42:27.400]  I'll find it because of the state.
[42:27.460 --> 42:30.700]  But I feel confident in saying that I stuck with the rules.
[42:31.100 --> 42:33.540]  Those are clearly end caps. Yeah, I did it.
[42:33.560 --> 42:35.240]  I just got super lucky with the chicken.
[42:35.460 --> 42:37.640]  I'm really sorry. I doubted your mom.
[42:38.160 --> 42:40.340]  She clearly shopped for you
[42:41.620 --> 42:46.320]  in these giant, Guinness World Record beating end caps.
[42:47.820 --> 42:52.740]  I've never been in a store in my life more suitable for this challenge.
[42:52.860 --> 42:54.080]  It's perfect, as I'm seeing here.
[42:54.300 --> 42:58.060]  I don't think it's possible in an HEB and in a Texas supermarket.
[42:58.360 --> 42:59.680]  I don't think I don't think there's an...
[42:59.680 --> 43:02.400]  Yeah, that's like three end caps put together.
[43:02.480 --> 43:03.760]  Just the one with the milk cart.
[43:03.760 --> 43:05.560]  Yeah, and there are definitely narrow ones.
[43:05.560 --> 43:07.640]  But those are like, I get the confusion.
[43:07.800 --> 43:09.300]  It's also everything you need.
[43:09.340 --> 43:11.080]  Like it really is everything you need.
[43:11.180 --> 43:12.880]  There's milk. Yeah, there's cheese.
[43:13.100 --> 43:15.360]  There's eggs. There's fucking chicken.
[43:15.660 --> 43:18.960]  There's coffee stuff like that's a whole week's worth of food.
[43:19.160 --> 43:21.780]  Yeah, I got super lucky. Mac and cheese.
[43:22.140 --> 43:26.020]  I wish it was harder because it's not it wasn't funny, which was the cool of it.
[43:26.080 --> 43:27.300]  I was like disappointed.
[43:27.660 --> 43:30.720]  It's the first challenge I've done where I was disappointed in doing it.
[43:31.080 --> 43:33.360]  It's kind of reminiscent of doing the chicken dinner challenge with PUBG.
[43:33.500 --> 43:34.900]  It was just a lot of chicken.
[43:34.900 --> 43:37.180]  That was bland because I couldn't put anything on it.
[43:37.480 --> 43:41.500]  OK, you have to live for a week, but you can only shop it in caps in a 7-Eleven.
[43:42.400 --> 43:43.380]  Oh, God.
[43:44.980 --> 43:47.240]  The sandwiches to 7-Eleven sandwiches.
[43:47.700 --> 43:52.680]  It's like Snickers and fucking like Sour Heads and shit like that.
[43:52.820 --> 43:56.400]  I also need to say that last night, sometimes the night before we record
[43:56.400 --> 44:01.420]  these, I'll go through our Discord chat and I'll just kind of think about
[44:01.420 --> 44:03.160]  what we last talked about and look at the images.
[44:03.600 --> 44:08.400]  I looked at the drawing I did of the end caps last night and just went,
[44:08.800 --> 44:09.960]  holy fuck, was that bad?
[44:10.400 --> 44:12.880]  That that was what a shit drawing.
[44:13.380 --> 44:15.560]  Having some time away from that, looking at it.
[44:15.720 --> 44:18.140]  I think I delivered the message of it.
[44:18.200 --> 44:19.780]  But wow, did that suck.
[44:19.780 --> 44:20.740]  I mean, you had COVID, though.
[44:21.320 --> 44:22.180]  I did. I was sick.
[44:22.240 --> 44:22.980]  I was out of it.
[44:23.060 --> 44:25.700]  I was definitely not in the best place.
[44:25.760 --> 44:29.180]  But yeah, it was funny looking at it last night going, holy shit.
[44:29.380 --> 44:31.700]  I did not realize how ugly this is.
[44:32.000 --> 44:32.600]  This is terrible.
[44:34.180 --> 44:35.240]  But that's the end caps.
[44:35.620 --> 44:38.060]  Well, speaking of the chat, I've got an update of my own
[44:38.620 --> 44:39.960]  based on what was in there last week.
[44:40.020 --> 44:40.640]  I also have an update.
[44:40.940 --> 44:41.800]  I'd love to hear yours.
[44:42.460 --> 44:44.200]  Let me just give it a little paste.
[44:44.680 --> 44:46.020]  Hope it's not too powerful.
[44:47.000 --> 44:47.720]  I love this.
[44:47.780 --> 44:49.120]  This is like the show and tell episode.
[44:49.300 --> 44:49.600]  It is.
[44:49.940 --> 44:50.840]  Yeah, it's a good recap.
[44:51.380 --> 44:54.460]  I'm interested to see if Gavin and I both have an update on the same thing,
[44:54.500 --> 44:57.980]  because I also there's another thing that was very contentious in the past that.
[44:58.820 --> 45:02.480]  Oh, no, put the puzzle back together.
[45:03.160 --> 45:07.000]  It looks like a hockey player's teeth, like the front of their teeth.
[45:07.240 --> 45:09.880]  I should put googly eyes above it.
[45:10.540 --> 45:11.980]  Except there's one too many teeth.
[45:13.760 --> 45:15.160]  That's fucking flawless, dude.
[45:15.660 --> 45:17.980]  Can I just say I was thinking about this?
[45:18.000 --> 45:21.140]  I was thinking about this after I was like, man, I was genuinely offering to help him.
[45:21.160 --> 45:22.940]  And he really doesn't seem to want my help with this.
[45:23.280 --> 45:24.420]  I guess he's got it.
[45:24.600 --> 45:27.220]  Or either he doesn't want to hang out or he just is like, fuck you.
[45:27.380 --> 45:28.480]  I don't think you'll do a good job.
[45:28.740 --> 45:31.040]  Pretty confident I would have done a better job.
[45:32.260 --> 45:34.240]  And I don't know where that missing bit is.
[45:34.440 --> 45:36.680]  Yeah, you've attached all the pieces back to the wall.
[45:37.140 --> 45:38.740]  Yeah, and you're missing a chunk.
[45:39.740 --> 45:43.040]  Either the guy took it for reference or it's fallen inside.
[45:43.600 --> 45:46.000]  Oh, Gavin's got a hockey ball.
[45:46.420 --> 45:47.820]  That's the funniest fucking thing.
[45:48.360 --> 45:52.900]  Did you it was like when you do a puzzle and you realize there's one piece missing at the end?
[45:52.960 --> 45:54.940]  Like how far into this process did you realize that?
[45:54.940 --> 45:56.780]  It was very confusing. It was really throwing me for a while.
[45:56.960 --> 45:58.800]  I could not figure out that middle section.
[46:02.600 --> 46:03.900]  So what's your plan now?
[46:04.240 --> 46:08.280]  Are you just going to cut more of the wall or what is the repair strategy?
[46:08.720 --> 46:09.860]  Uh, could go for tape.
[46:10.120 --> 46:11.560]  Yeah, tape it.
[46:12.180 --> 46:12.580]  Yeah.
[46:13.220 --> 46:17.480]  Maybe you should just put like the no scrumping sign over that hole and just pretend it doesn't exist.
[46:18.040 --> 46:23.100]  If you want it to get professionally fixed, I got there's dudes in my house right now that do this for a living.
[46:23.280 --> 46:25.340]  I'm more than happy to share their information with you.
[46:25.560 --> 46:26.520]  The tattooed dudes.
[46:28.160 --> 46:29.060]  We'll figure something out.
[46:29.320 --> 46:30.880]  I genuinely forgot about the wall.
[46:30.880 --> 46:33.020]  What a shitty job that person did.
[46:34.100 --> 46:34.980]  That's unbelievable.
[46:35.720 --> 46:38.380]  And then whoever did the follow up patchwork.
[46:39.600 --> 46:42.980]  If you would have told me that was their fix to it, Gavin, I would have believed it.
[46:43.080 --> 46:45.080]  That seems equal with the job they did.
[46:45.540 --> 46:47.900]  Just feels like it's the same energy.
[46:49.160 --> 46:51.180]  It's the same exact energy.
[46:51.960 --> 46:57.260]  Well, I had another point of contention, I guess, to just wrap up the last of the wrap up, at least from my end.
[46:57.860 --> 47:03.240]  We got into a real there's a real argument between the extra medium we had recently.
[47:03.460 --> 47:05.020]  Yeah. Does it exist?
[47:05.160 --> 47:06.220]  Where is it on the scale?
[47:07.100 --> 47:12.120]  I mean, Geoff has the clothing line, but I don't feel like any of us are true experts in the fashion industry.
[47:12.460 --> 47:20.060]  So I took it upon myself to see if we could get a ruling from maybe a more established company or brand.
[47:20.060 --> 47:32.320]  So I reached out to essentially every large fashion fashion brand I could from Supreme to Gucci, Prada, Nike, Reebok, Adid, all of them.
[47:32.460 --> 47:33.340]  I reached out to all of them.
[47:33.440 --> 47:35.240]  I sent out over 10 emails.
[47:35.840 --> 47:38.120]  Some of them I even attached your drawing, Gavin.
[47:38.740 --> 47:46.340]  And I will say that I got a zero percent response rate on ones in which I attached your diagram of your size chart.
[47:46.860 --> 47:51.380]  But I did receive two replies to different companies.
[47:51.600 --> 47:55.880]  I will post in the chat right now and then I will read the responses.
[47:56.220 --> 48:00.700]  New there from our first reply comes from Ralph Lauren.
[48:01.060 --> 48:05.540]  Dear Andrew, thank you for contacting Ralph Lauren dot com customer assistance.
[48:06.180 --> 48:10.660]  We apologize, however, because extra medium is not a size we offer.
[48:10.860 --> 48:13.220]  We are unable to advise how it would fit.
[48:13.220 --> 48:17.200]  If you need further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us.
[48:17.600 --> 48:18.420]  Sincerely, Kimberly.
[48:18.880 --> 48:21.820]  Do they think you were like specifically asking about their products?
[48:22.760 --> 48:26.280]  They all kind of nobody wanted to take ownership of the responses.
[48:26.500 --> 48:29.980]  They were like, hypothetically, if we did that, no one wanted to do a general ruling.
[48:30.360 --> 48:33.820]  Kimberly is not having your shit, but she is required as her job.
[48:36.440 --> 48:38.860]  Which is nice because most didn't.
[48:38.900 --> 48:40.240]  But we did get a response from Kimberly.
[48:40.840 --> 48:43.840]  And the next response, I think, is is very fascinating.
[48:44.140 --> 48:45.980]  And if anything, it maybe helps your argument.
[48:46.220 --> 48:48.100]  Gavin is from Lacoste.
[48:48.120 --> 48:50.860]  Oh, wow. I got to zoom in on this because it's small.
[48:51.240 --> 48:52.140]  Good afternoon, Andrew.
[48:52.340 --> 48:53.840]  Thank you for contacting Lacoste.
[48:54.380 --> 48:59.200]  Our size medium does sometimes come in slightly bigger and smaller sizes.
[48:59.540 --> 49:02.160]  S slash M, M, M slash L.
[49:02.260 --> 49:05.880]  So they do have variations of medium on the item style, such as are.
[49:06.320 --> 49:08.660]  And this is the most insane product description I've ever heard.
[49:08.660 --> 49:13.520]  Men's Heritage Graphic Color Block Zippered Water Resistant Jacket.
[49:13.600 --> 49:14.300]  That's one thing.
[49:15.080 --> 49:17.280]  As some of our jackets run larger than usual.
[49:17.860 --> 49:19.580]  We hope this information is useful to you.
[49:19.960 --> 49:21.260]  Thank you for shopping at Lacoste.
[49:21.520 --> 49:24.220]  Whether you're shopping online or stopping by one of our boutiques,
[49:24.380 --> 49:25.740]  we look forward to seeing you soon.
[49:26.040 --> 49:27.760]  Kyne records, Jennifer with a Y.
[49:28.180 --> 49:30.020]  So there's range within the medium.
[49:30.280 --> 49:33.200]  There is apparently range within the medium, which makes your drawing,
[49:33.280 --> 49:37.080]  I feel like, somewhat valid of the three different areas within medium.
[49:37.080 --> 49:38.260]  Well, I think so.
[49:38.420 --> 49:43.260]  And last week in the merch thread, was it Maxi that was on my side about it?
[49:43.720 --> 49:45.720]  Yeah. Somebody, somebody was on your side.
[49:46.020 --> 49:47.360]  Oh, let me look in the merch chat.
[49:51.180 --> 49:56.020]  Eric was getting really, really annoyed in this Slack chat,
[49:56.560 --> 49:59.240]  because I said, if you were to design shirts...
[49:59.240 --> 50:00.040]  Medium size determined.
[50:00.240 --> 50:02.440]  Eric, what was your thought on how that Slack chat went?
[50:03.260 --> 50:04.700]  I didn't like it.
[50:06.100 --> 50:10.940]  Maxi wrote, extra medium is medium, medium extra is large.
[50:11.480 --> 50:12.780]  Medium extra.
[50:13.140 --> 50:17.780]  And then Tony pointed out that there is a company called Marine Layer
[50:17.780 --> 50:22.360]  who actually has a size with a name that sits in between medium and large,
[50:22.620 --> 50:26.480]  which is where your head was going, Eric, and they call it Marge.
[50:27.240 --> 50:27.740]  Marge!
[50:27.960 --> 50:29.240]  I don't like Marge.
[50:29.540 --> 50:31.020]  I'm not a fan of that. No, not at all.
[50:31.280 --> 50:34.480]  That is a bad, that's a bad, that's a bad thing.
[50:34.480 --> 50:39.520]  I will say that I feel like we didn't get any rulings
[50:40.320 --> 50:41.440]  from people.
[50:43.100 --> 50:47.300]  In the merch team, Maxi is on the social team
[50:47.300 --> 50:51.880]  and is therefore disqualified from any kind of ruling there.
[50:52.060 --> 50:53.260]  Yeah, 100%.
[50:53.260 --> 50:55.140]  Do you like my T-shirt, by the way?
[50:55.520 --> 50:56.180]  Your T-shirt?
[50:56.660 --> 50:57.940]  Do you like the shirt I'm wearing in this picture?
[50:58.320 --> 50:59.180]  This is me right now.
[50:59.960 --> 51:01.900]  That's a nice extra medium fit, I'd say.
[51:02.320 --> 51:04.020]  Fine. Why are you asking?
[51:06.000 --> 51:06.440]  Huuuuuuuuhhh...
[51:07.060 --> 51:11.700]  It's a nice, it's a nice, I'm wearing a nice Marge T-shirt here.
[51:11.940 --> 51:12.420]  This sucks.
[51:12.740 --> 51:18.000]  You bought a Marge shirt out of spite?
[51:18.620 --> 51:23.080]  I wanted to see what it felt like to wear a shirt between what I asked for and what you gave me.
[51:23.260 --> 51:24.600]  And to me, that is Marge.
[51:25.140 --> 51:26.560]  And how does it feel?
[51:27.120 --> 51:29.280]  A little bit big. Could have done with extra medium.
[51:29.380 --> 51:29.680]  Really?
[51:30.000 --> 51:30.900]  Fuck off.
[51:33.080 --> 51:37.120]  I fucking hate this. I was hoping this wouldn't come up again.
[51:37.880 --> 51:39.720]  And this is gonna sound...
[51:39.720 --> 51:43.580]  Listen, I swear I'm not influenced by the PS5 in any way whatsoever.
[51:45.020 --> 51:51.620]  But I was thinking about this in bed over the weekend and I fucking changed my mind.
[51:52.940 --> 51:54.500]  I did. I did.
[51:55.000 --> 51:56.000]  And here's why.
[51:56.420 --> 51:57.940]  This is bullshit. This is absolutely bullshit.
[51:57.940 --> 51:59.140]  No, I'm not happy about it.
[51:59.160 --> 52:03.020]  I'm gonna buy you an Xbox Series X and get you back on my team.
[52:04.340 --> 52:07.300]  No, seriously, it has nothing to do with the PlayStation. I had already changed my mind.
[52:07.560 --> 52:11.320]  And here's why. I hate it. I don't like it. I don't like to agree with him.
[52:11.520 --> 52:13.200]  I was much happier on your side, Eric.
[52:13.620 --> 52:17.140]  But it was way more comfortable and feels smarter to be on your side than his.
[52:17.340 --> 52:17.920]  Trust me.
[52:19.040 --> 52:23.620]  But I started thinking about extra small and how the extra modifies small.
[52:23.880 --> 52:25.580]  And the definition of small is tiny.
[52:25.580 --> 52:27.480]  So it should be extra tiny.
[52:28.100 --> 52:29.740]  And, and, and, and...
[52:30.520 --> 52:31.380]  I'm not done.
[52:31.940 --> 52:35.120]  And on the other end, large does the converse thing.
[52:35.400 --> 52:40.480]  Like the name large connotates big and to make it extra large makes it bigger than the normal large.
[52:40.820 --> 52:43.620]  And then the definition of medium is like in the middle.
[52:43.900 --> 52:47.580]  So the only way for something to be extra would be extra in the middle.
[52:48.240 --> 52:50.680]  I hate that I agree with him.
[52:50.760 --> 52:51.080]  You're wrong.
[52:51.080 --> 52:55.780]  The first thing you want is medium, which is what the word means.
[52:56.120 --> 52:57.700]  The word is wrong.
[52:58.160 --> 52:59.580]  No, it doesn't.
[52:59.580 --> 53:01.200]  I hate it, but it makes sense.
[53:01.720 --> 53:03.840]  Medium is a different medium.
[53:04.460 --> 53:08.080]  So it would have to not be true medium, which would be medium.
[53:08.500 --> 53:11.600]  It has to be something else by virtue of the name.
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.320]  Nick said Geoff is swavy, but that was my argument last week, wasn't it?
[53:15.380 --> 53:16.280]  Yes, it was.
[53:16.420 --> 53:18.780]  So I think you're just a revolutionary, Gavin.
[53:18.780 --> 53:21.480]  Yeah, I just don't think you expressed your arguments well.
[53:21.680 --> 53:22.960]  Oh, I'm terrible at expressing.
[53:24.880 --> 53:29.900]  It's so funny you say that, Geoff. I had the same exact experience with the same exact thought process.
[53:30.080 --> 53:31.540]  Or I wasn't happy about it.
[53:31.820 --> 53:38.360]  But I had to concede to myself that what Gavin is saying, to an extent, I think actually does make sense.
[53:38.740 --> 53:41.340]  And we're still too far ahead on recordings to see what the audience thinks.
[53:41.440 --> 53:43.640]  Because the big discussion hasn't really come out yet.
[53:43.740 --> 53:44.500]  But I'm excited.
[53:45.420 --> 53:47.620]  Even what you just said, Gavin, came to my head.
[53:47.700 --> 53:50.200]  I know you made this argument at the time.
[53:50.580 --> 53:52.120]  But it was just so shocking.
[53:52.340 --> 53:53.180]  And seeing your diagram.
[53:53.440 --> 53:54.940]  I don't think it really landed.
[53:55.100 --> 53:56.500]  I need to time the process.
[53:57.400 --> 53:59.960]  It uses a word to define.
[54:00.280 --> 54:01.540]  No, it can't.
[54:01.920 --> 54:05.840]  You guys are saying that medium is now something else.
[54:06.880 --> 54:12.640]  So if I were to get a medium shirt, it wouldn't be extra medium, which is the most medium?
[54:13.940 --> 54:18.160]  I mean, according to Lacoste, there's sometimes maybe three different variants of medium.
[54:18.300 --> 54:20.280]  But that's not extra medium.
[54:20.600 --> 54:24.960]  Gavin, who's saying that extra medium is the most medium.
[54:26.340 --> 54:29.540]  Well, I'm saying that their middle-sized medium would be the extra medium.
[54:31.360 --> 54:35.000]  Their middle-sized medium is medium.
[54:35.860 --> 54:38.440]  So medium and extra medium are the same?
[54:38.960 --> 54:40.220]  Look, if we...
[54:40.220 --> 54:43.260]  No, I think extra medium would be more medium than medium.
[54:43.580 --> 54:44.040]  Yeah, I agree.
[54:44.420 --> 54:46.580]  Medium is no longer the middle.
[54:46.780 --> 54:50.780]  It's like a middle-ish range, and then extra medium is more dialed in.
[54:51.040 --> 54:54.180]  Isn't there a range, though, of small to large?
[54:55.420 --> 54:57.480]  It has a large factor, right?
[54:57.680 --> 54:59.840]  There's different variations of what large could be.
[55:00.100 --> 55:01.900]  Why couldn't there be a range of where medium is?
[55:02.240 --> 55:03.140]  There can't be.
[55:03.420 --> 55:06.000]  And if extra medium is a thing, it's bigger than medium.
[55:06.000 --> 55:10.980]  Yeah, Nick's got it. He says medium's rarely perfectly between small and large.
[55:11.060 --> 55:12.260]  I think that there's a range.
[55:12.460 --> 55:19.920]  So an extra medium would be pinpointed, laser-focused, scientifically the most medium a medium could be.
[55:20.180 --> 55:21.980]  I'll be honest, I didn't see it going that way for you, Eric.
[55:22.480 --> 55:24.700]  No, I don't think that everyone's going this way.
[55:24.800 --> 55:27.240]  It's because I'm right and everyone else is wrong.
[55:27.400 --> 55:29.720]  So I also didn't see it going this way.
[55:30.860 --> 55:33.340]  I'm sorry, Eric. I really would rather be on your side.
[55:33.340 --> 55:38.780]  I can't deny the fact that he gets into your brain and then it just fucking turns on you.
[55:38.780 --> 55:43.520]  Merriam-Webster's Dictionary. Medium. Something that is in the middle position, as in size.
[55:43.920 --> 55:50.040]  So what you're saying is that extra medium is the most medium, so medium is no longer the middle.
[55:50.460 --> 55:53.340]  No, no. It's the middle. The middle of the middle.
[55:53.720 --> 55:55.540]  But what you did, Eric, you gave me a large.
[55:59.570 --> 56:01.290]  Which is what I would do.
[56:01.750 --> 56:10.430]  When asked for extra medium, something that doesn't fucking exist, I automatically go to large.
[56:10.970 --> 56:11.250]  Yeah.
[56:12.430 --> 56:15.690]  All of this could have been avoided, Gavin, if you just would have asked for a marge.
[56:15.810 --> 56:17.330]  Why did you ask for a marge?
[56:18.010 --> 56:22.450]  It sounds like a marge is too much medium for him.
[56:23.130 --> 56:24.670]  It's a little bit too big.
[56:28.250 --> 56:31.790]  Speaking of which, if you want to see Gavin in his extra medium,
[56:31.970 --> 56:34.750]  you can watch the first episode of Does It Do?
[56:35.070 --> 56:40.070]  premiering on the Rooster Teeth and the F*** Face YouTube channel on...
[56:41.870 --> 56:42.310]  September...
[56:42.310 --> 56:43.030]  Second.
[56:43.430 --> 56:45.490]  Thank you! I had no idea what the date was.
[56:45.630 --> 56:46.490]  I was really hoping Eric would just drop it.
[56:46.490 --> 56:49.370]  By the time this is out, the first episode will be out,
[56:49.530 --> 56:52.710]  but the second episode will be coming out right afterward.
[56:52.910 --> 56:54.850]  I think the 8th or 9th.
[56:54.850 --> 56:58.030]  So we'll have the first two episodes of our pilot
[56:58.030 --> 57:01.770]  and then we'll get back in the studio and do a lot more.
[57:02.030 --> 57:05.430]  I think we walked out of that recording going,
[57:05.650 --> 57:07.450]  Oh, we can do like two seasons of the show in a day.
[57:07.810 --> 57:09.050]  We definitely did.
[57:09.230 --> 57:12.850]  I will say, I've watched the first episode about 20 times now
[57:12.850 --> 57:15.550]  and I think it's a good episode.
[57:16.190 --> 57:17.290]  We've got good edits.
[57:17.410 --> 57:18.830]  I think episode 2 is going to be way better.
[57:19.310 --> 57:22.790]  I just want to say, I'm clearly the worst part of episode 1.
[57:22.790 --> 57:24.190]  I will get better audience.
[57:24.290 --> 57:25.230]  What do you mean? You did all the work.
[57:25.450 --> 57:25.810]  Gavin's great.
[57:26.390 --> 57:28.710]  You did all the stuff.
[57:28.910 --> 57:30.390]  I'm very mediocre at it.
[57:31.850 --> 57:33.310]  Episode 2, I'm really looking forward to.
[57:33.390 --> 57:35.650]  There's a teaser trailer at the end of 1 that I'm really jazzed about.
[57:37.690 --> 57:38.410]  Go ahead.
[57:39.030 --> 57:39.250]  No you.
[57:41.750 --> 57:42.770]  Alright, fuck both of you.
[57:43.350 --> 57:44.790]  When do we get to record again?
[57:45.530 --> 57:46.750]  Yeah, that's a great question, Gavin.
[57:47.350 --> 57:48.830]  When are you available again?
[57:49.550 --> 57:50.530]  I'm available today.
[57:51.370 --> 57:53.790]  Okay, so that doesn't fucking help.
[57:53.910 --> 57:55.770]  So when are you available again?
[57:57.230 --> 57:58.090]  I'm available.
[57:58.270 --> 58:00.070]  It's like 4pm.
[58:00.390 --> 58:01.650]  I'm available today.
[58:02.810 --> 58:04.210]  Get the boys together.
[58:04.350 --> 58:05.910]  Tell them they're staying at work late tonight.
[58:06.090 --> 58:06.670]  Gavin's ready.
[58:07.490 --> 58:08.890]  No, I'm also available next week.
[58:08.930 --> 58:09.610]  If you want to do 2?
[58:09.930 --> 58:10.250]  Yes.
[58:10.670 --> 58:10.910]  What?
[58:11.650 --> 58:13.230]  You're available next week?
[58:13.350 --> 58:13.890]  Oh boy.
[58:14.030 --> 58:15.130]  Okay, let me see if I can...
[58:15.130 --> 58:16.610]  Oh man, I don't have anything ordered.
[58:16.770 --> 58:17.270]  Like, I don't...
[58:17.270 --> 58:18.130]  Okay, I can try.
[58:18.270 --> 58:18.710]  Yeah, fuck.
[58:18.710 --> 58:19.090]  Alright.
[58:21.790 --> 58:22.870]  Oh my god.
[58:23.070 --> 58:26.830]  Eric did not know how to handle Gavin being...
[58:27.990 --> 58:30.110]  Oh, because I thought it was two weeks out at least.
[58:30.270 --> 58:32.910]  Oh, I thought we were going post-Labor Day.
[58:33.270 --> 58:35.630]  I really did not think it was going to be like, yeah, next week.
[58:35.730 --> 58:36.250]  Had no idea.
[58:36.630 --> 58:38.110]  That might be a double first.
[58:38.490 --> 58:44.630]  I've never seen Eric, like, stymied for a response to not know how to handle it.
[58:44.630 --> 58:49.450]  And I've never, I've never seen Gavin come out of the gate and be like, yeah.
[58:49.990 --> 58:52.210]  I almost think you didn't want me to be available next week.
[58:52.210 --> 58:59.390]  No, I thought you were unavailable next week and then we would be back sometime after Labor Day.
[59:00.410 --> 59:03.150]  I mean, next week is... I mean, we could do it then.
[59:03.590 --> 59:06.350]  Hang on, hang on, hang on. I don't like this answer.
[59:06.650 --> 59:09.750]  What were you going to say when you were going to put caveats on it?
[59:10.250 --> 59:11.210]  Well, I'll be honest.
[59:12.810 --> 59:17.530]  My, my ass and legs still hurt from what I fell over last time.
[59:18.750 --> 59:24.150]  I'd say, I'd say the left of my pelvis is like 70% still.
[59:24.830 --> 59:27.170]  And I spent the last week at maybe like 50.
[59:28.570 --> 59:29.050]  I...
[59:29.050 --> 59:30.290]  Next week, I'm opening it up.
[59:31.930 --> 59:34.410]  If you want to go after Labor Day, I'll probably be 100%.
[59:34.410 --> 59:36.350]  I mean, we have our first...
[59:36.350 --> 59:37.570]  Not for long, you won't.
[59:38.170 --> 59:40.510]  We have our first office day next week.
[59:41.010 --> 59:42.130]  Oh, yeah, we do.
[59:43.010 --> 59:43.170]  Yeah.
[59:43.530 --> 59:44.290]  That's exciting.
[59:44.790 --> 59:44.910]  Yeah.
[59:45.490 --> 59:51.750]  I gotta say, I forgot how much and how hard you ate shit in that recording session.
[59:51.870 --> 59:53.310]  Until I started watching the episode.
[59:53.550 --> 59:55.810]  Dude, the one that hurt was in episode two.
[59:56.350 --> 59:59.930]  And I must have trapped a nerve or something because I went every night...
[59:59.930 --> 01:00:02.670]  And the reason I'm like forgetting shit all over the place...
[01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:05.150]  I ain't been sleeping good since that fall.
[01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:07.030]  My leg...
[01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:11.890]  I can't lie on one side because it crushes my leg bone into my pelvis, which hurts.
[01:00:12.070 --> 01:00:16.410]  And if I go on the other side, my leg falls asleep and starts tingling at like 3am.
[01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:20.270]  And I was about to go to the doctor, but it's actually stopped doing that.
[01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:21.950]  I think I trapped a nerve or something.
[01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:22.910]  I smashed something.
[01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:24.270]  I hit hard.
[01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:25.090]  You did.
[01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:25.630]  That's terrible.
[01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:28.310]  And I've been having shit sleep.
[01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:30.910]  Oh, man.
[01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:37.730]  The funny thing about it, too, is that at no point in any of those episodes did you need to eat shit.
[01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:40.510]  No, that's the whole point. It was completely pointless.
[01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:45.750]  You kicked the fucking TV with your foot.
[01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:48.110]  Six feet in the air.
[01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:50.730]  I was so surprised. I had forgotten that happened.
[01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:53.010]  I was so caught off guard in the episode when it happened.
[01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:59.370]  I think the third night I was up at three because I had to stand up and sort of get the blood back into my leg.
[01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:01.650]  And I was thinking all these different things.
[01:01:01.830 --> 01:01:03.390]  I've wrecked my leg permanently.
[01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:04.330]  I've trapped a nerve.
[01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:05.370]  I've got a blood clot.
[01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:06.410]  I'm going to die.
[01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:10.730]  And I was just like, I just need to settle down and stop jumping all around.
[01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:12.150]  I'm in my mid-thirties.
[01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:13.190]  I've got to pack it in.
[01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:15.390]  And then the pain eventually went away.
[01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:17.550]  And I was like, oh, I'm excited for the next one.
[01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:20.110]  I didn't learn anything.
[01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:24.550]  Dude, I've been having that conversation with myself for 17 years.
[01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:26.270]  It's pointless.
[01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:30.910]  And here I am taking pictures of my bruises to send you today.
[01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:32.830]  It's just who you are, bud.
[01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:37.150]  Well, let's try to film it next week if we can.
[01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:39.670]  Failing that, are you available the following week?
[01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:41.930]  I think you're not, are you?
[01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:43.030]  I think I'm.
[01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:46.790]  Well, anyway, we don't need to turn this into a whole supplemental scheduling episode.
[01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:48.990]  As a matter of fact, we should probably wrap up.
[01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:50.910]  We wrapped up a lot today, I feel like.
[01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:51.210]  We did.
[01:01:51.490 --> 01:01:52.750]  Tied up a lot of loose ends.
[01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:53.430]  It was.
[01:01:54.090 --> 01:01:55.670]  Everybody got to share some photos.
[01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:57.150]  I was.
[01:01:57.650 --> 01:02:01.770]  I'll be honest, I had forgotten about the hockey tee thing and it was great.
[01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:05.530]  It was really great to see the resolution of that.
[01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:06.790]  And I hope you don't change it.
[01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:07.410]  I hope that that's.
[01:02:09.730 --> 01:02:12.590]  It is so incongruous with the rest of your house.
[01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:13.110]  I love it.
[01:02:13.170 --> 01:02:14.110]  It's so fucking awesome.
[01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:18.030]  And Andrew, I'm glad you're feeling better.
[01:02:18.210 --> 01:02:20.030]  And we should probably also mention.
[01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:22.950]  We did not record the monkey movie.
[01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:24.910]  I recognize that we were very excited.
[01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:25.850]  We were talking about it.
[01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:27.070]  We were going to do it.
[01:02:27.130 --> 01:02:27.990]  It was a big thing.
[01:02:28.310 --> 01:02:30.230]  I think we talked about it a lot in the episode.
[01:02:30.490 --> 01:02:33.930]  And then I just don't want the audience to be like, why are they talking about it?
[01:02:34.090 --> 01:02:37.910]  We had unfortunate scheduling conflicts that came up.
[01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:40.150]  And so we are still going to record this goddamn monkey movie.
[01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:42.550]  This is not a bit where we never do the thing.
[01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:43.570]  We really will.
[01:02:43.570 --> 01:02:45.250]  We really will record MVP 2.
[01:02:45.350 --> 01:02:46.710]  I'm looking into spreadsheets.
[01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:47.910]  Since I have more time.
[01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:49.230]  I'm going to do this right.
[01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:50.610]  You're going to get what you want.
[01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:52.470]  I'm looking for the star, right?
[01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:53.150]  The star fading.
[01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:53.910]  Is that what you wanted?
[01:02:54.530 --> 01:02:56.170]  Star wipe or a banana wipe?
[01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.890]  Yeah.
[01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:57.910]  Star wipe.
[01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:59.430]  I'm looking at all the wipes.
[01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:01.230]  We're going to get some wipes in there.
[01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:01.690]  Alright.
[01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:02.390]  There you have it.
[01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:06.370]  It may come late, but when it comes, it's going to be full of banana wipes.
[01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:08.890]  Should we mention groceries?
[01:03:11.970 --> 01:03:12.510]  I'm sorry.
[01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:12.950]  What did you say?
[01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:14.230]  I'm sorry.
[01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:16.910]  I'm sorry Discord cut out so I didn't hear the transition.
[01:03:17.350 --> 01:03:18.110]  I'm so sorry.
[01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:19.330]  I was going to...
[01:03:19.330 --> 01:03:19.910]  I thought...
[01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:20.810]  I'm so sorry.
[01:03:20.810 --> 01:03:23.650]  You're just jumping in the air and you're just slapping it straight back down.
[01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:25.650]  I'm so sorry.
[01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:31.790]  I was asking if we should mention GrowTubes because we haven't sold the GrowTubes.
[01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:36.830]  I know they'll probably be gone by the time this comes out, ideally, but just we're selling them online.
[01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:38.030]  We haven't done that before.
[01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:40.550]  I can't believe we hadn't already sold them.
[01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:43.250]  Yeah, I thought they were going to go on sale right after us.
[01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:47.050]  I keep thinking we have these conversations and then I find out that they're still out for sale.
[01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:48.750]  So maybe we sold them.
[01:03:48.810 --> 01:03:50.330]  I hope we did by this point.
[01:03:50.330 --> 01:03:53.930]  They're not available or if they're still available, you can buy one now.
[01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:56.250]  Roosterteethstore.com
[01:03:57.730 --> 01:04:01.050]  Roosterteethstore.com is what you think the website is.
[01:04:01.210 --> 01:04:01.950]  I don't know.
[01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:03.010]  I have no idea.
[01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.930]  I didn't know.
[01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:05.410]  I thought there was an F11.
[01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:09.010]  Roosterteethstore.roosterteeth.com
[01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:11.650]  Oh, my URL is way better.
[01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:12.390]  All your face needs.
[01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:13.750]  Check them out.
[01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:18.390]  Roosterteethstore.com
[01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:21.750]  I typed in roosterteethstore.com and it took me to my iTunes library.
[01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:22.590]  What the hell just happened?
[01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:24.110]  I'm loading.
[01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:24.770]  Can we end?
[01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:25.690]  What are we doing?
[01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:26.210]  What the fuck is...
[01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:26.770]  What's happening?
[01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:28.190]  It's doing the same thing.
[01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:29.010]  Hacker.
[01:04:29.110 --> 01:04:29.370]  Hacker.
[01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:30.710]  Stay away from roosterteethstore.com.
[01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:31.750]  Don't type that in.
[01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:33.850]  Store.roosterteeth.com
[01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:35.450]  Do not ignore.
[01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:36.830]  It's trying to get me to listen to something.
[01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:38.290]  This is insane.
[01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:40.410]  Store.roosterteeth.com
[01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:45.030]  Thanks for listening to episode 119 of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:47.710]  Hope to see you again next time.
[01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:48.070]  Goodbye.
[01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:49.510]  Alright, boys.
[01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:51.110]  Let's all go ice down our wounds.
[01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:54.770]  Hey guys.
[01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:58.390]  Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:01.610]  Andrew's ankles are no longer 100%.
[01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:03.290]  What happened to Geoff's car?
[01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:05.090]  At least Geoff has a nice bedroom.
[01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:07.170]  It's the Go Go Now Tattoo.
[01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:09.550]  We are due another betting challenge.
[01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:11.590]  Hatton really wants to play Paw Patrol.
[01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:14.530]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:05:14.530 --> 01:05:17.590]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
