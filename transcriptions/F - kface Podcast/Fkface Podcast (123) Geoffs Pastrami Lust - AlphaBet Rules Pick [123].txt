[00:15.180 --> 00:20.120]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast. My name is Geoff Ramsey
[00:20.120 --> 00:25.260]  with me as always, Andrew Pant and Gavin Free. Episode one hundred and twenty three. One
[00:25.260 --> 00:32.480]  two three. One two three. There you go. Year something whatever. OK. If you're bringing
[00:32.480 --> 00:36.400]  back the year, you can't half-ass it. I don't know what it is. It's like year whatever,
[00:36.800 --> 00:41.460]  volume whatever. I'm just happy he's back to this place, Gavin. It feels comfortable.
[00:41.460 --> 00:47.060]  I'm working my way back into it after after the slanderous day I had where you guys yelled
[00:47.060 --> 00:52.700]  at me about it. Fat play. I... man, I'm struggling to figure out how to start this after the
[00:52.700 --> 01:01.300]  conversation we just had between episodes. We determined... well, Pastrami. We'll start
[01:01.300 --> 01:05.620]  with Pastrami. All right. I'm going to upload a photo. You guys have already seen it, but
[01:05.620 --> 01:09.400]  just for posterity. Yeah. Just so we know what we're looking at. I have so many questions.
[01:10.060 --> 01:18.140]  The other day... this story actually starts before the Pastrami. Pre-strami? It's pre-strami.
[01:18.220 --> 01:26.240]  Yeah. It starts with about three weeks ago. I went out to breakfast with Emily and on
[01:26.240 --> 01:35.240]  the menu was migas, which I love. I get migas all the time. And they had like for the daily
[01:35.240 --> 01:42.200]  special was corned beef migas. And I thought, that sounds gross, but I bet it's not. And
[01:42.200 --> 01:47.200]  I did like corned... corned beef is how I got to pastrami. I discovered I liked corned
[01:47.200 --> 01:50.740]  beef. And then I thought... and I'd read... I read online that pastrami was better than
[01:50.740 --> 01:56.360]  corned beef and it was prepared better. And I think corned beef is boiled, whereas pastrami
[01:56.360 --> 02:03.780]  is smoked. And so I thought, well, you know, corned beef was my... I guess my on ramp to
[02:03.780 --> 02:09.240]  pastrami. Maybe it'll be how I return to pastrami. Right. And so I ordered the corned
[02:09.240 --> 02:17.200]  beef migas and, you know, migas is good. Corned beef is good. Together, it was a little weird,
[02:17.340 --> 02:22.720]  but it wasn't gross. I wouldn't necessarily eat it again. I appreciate the creativity
[02:22.720 --> 02:28.820]  of that chef. But the big takeaway was corned beef migas not great. Corned beef was okay.
[02:28.820 --> 02:34.960]  I was like, oh, this isn't bad, you know. And so just last week I was riding around
[02:35.940 --> 02:40.880]  running errands and I was super fucking hungry. And I thought, you know what? I had the corned
[02:40.880 --> 02:45.240]  beef and it was okay. What if I just rip off the bandaid? I happen to be in the part of town where
[02:45.240 --> 02:49.600]  my favorite deli, my favorite pastrami sandwich in Austin is. It's a place called Biederman's
[02:49.600 --> 02:56.440]  over on Far West. And I thought, what if I just dip in? I got some time to kill and I'll just
[02:56.440 --> 03:00.300]  order my pastrami sandwich and we'll just fucking see what happens. Like corned beef didn't gross
[03:00.300 --> 03:05.480]  me out. I can say the word pastrami again without getting nauseous. You know, I've clearly I've
[03:05.480 --> 03:11.280]  clearly made progress. Let's let's see where we let's see where we are. And so I went in and I
[03:11.280 --> 03:15.280]  ordered my favorite pastrami sandwich in town, the best pastrami I've ever had in my life.
[03:15.640 --> 03:22.040]  And I sat down and I started to eat it. And I immediately was hit with a little wave of nausea
[03:22.040 --> 03:28.200]  from the smell, from the smell. But I got past it. I got past it. And I just ate.
[03:28.700 --> 03:38.060]  I just ate pastrami. And the love affair is over. It wasn't good. It was just it was.
[03:38.700 --> 03:44.840]  Yeah. Yeah. Wow. You can't go home again. I was telling Emily and she's she described that as
[03:44.840 --> 03:49.460]  you were never in love with pastrami. It was only ever lust. And I think that that's
[03:49.900 --> 03:56.180]  and it burned you. Yeah. And I think I was burned by lust. And I think that, yeah, I don't know what
[03:56.180 --> 03:59.260]  else to say. I didn't even finish the sandwich. It didn't make me want to throw up. It didn't
[03:59.260 --> 04:02.860]  gross me out. It didn't make me gag. It just wasn't. You don't think this was just a bad
[04:02.860 --> 04:07.180]  pastrami sandwich? I don't think so. I think it was. I mean, look at it. It looks gorgeous.
[04:07.980 --> 04:12.920]  It was just it's identical to any pastrami. The pickle was phenomenal.
[04:13.960 --> 04:19.360]  Uh, what's the schmear on it? That's just honey. It's just mustard. Okay. Uh,
[04:20.180 --> 04:24.280]  that sandwich is just bread, like rye bread or whatever bread that is, not rye bread,
[04:24.340 --> 04:28.660]  but whatever bread that is. And then hot pastrami and hot mustard. That's all that
[04:28.660 --> 04:32.680]  sandwich is. Looking at that picture, it looks pretty good, but I know I would be
[04:32.680 --> 04:40.500]  done with it after one half. I, yeah. I mean, it seems like a lot. I, uh, I normally or previously
[04:40.500 --> 04:45.740]  had been able to destroy that sandwich, uh, and not leave one crumb on the, on the table.
[04:46.500 --> 04:51.840]  I didn't make it through half. I made it. Wow. I probably made 33% of the way through the
[04:51.840 --> 04:57.100]  sandwich and then I just threw it away. Uh, I'm a little bummed. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a little bummed.
[04:57.380 --> 05:01.040]  Cause at least before you didn't know. Yeah. Before I didn't know. And I just had like,
[05:01.120 --> 05:07.380]  I just kind of had a memory of loving it. And now that memory is a bit obscured by the reality that
[05:07.380 --> 05:14.000]  I no longer connect with pastrami on any sort of, uh, I don't know, guttural flavor-based level.
[05:14.340 --> 05:18.780]  It's kind of like going home and visiting your hometown after going to college, I assume,
[05:18.900 --> 05:23.160]  and seeing it for what it is, you know, after time has passed and you're like, Oh, this is,
[05:23.300 --> 05:27.340]  it's a lot smaller than I remember. It's not quite as, it doesn't, the buildings don't shine
[05:27.340 --> 05:32.520]  quite as bright, you know? Uh, and, and that was definitely the case for pastrami. It doesn't,
[05:32.600 --> 05:37.000]  it doesn't make me sick. It doesn't gross me out, but, uh, I don't think I like it.
[05:37.520 --> 05:42.160]  I, this is a perfect bookend, I feel, to your pastrami arc on this show. I, I like that we
[05:42.160 --> 05:49.500]  have fully captured you falling in lust, I guess, with the pastrami sandwich. Your, your breakup
[05:49.500 --> 05:54.300]  with it, your devastating end, and then your ability to return and realize that you are not
[05:54.300 --> 06:00.520]  the same person that you previously were. I mean, clearly, clearly pastrami hasn't changed. I have,
[06:00.700 --> 06:06.160]  right? I can't blame pastrami. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Uh, but I did, but I can't lie to myself,
[06:06.160 --> 06:10.920]  you know? I have to acknowledge that, uh, I'm different. I'm not the person I was,
[06:10.980 --> 06:16.540]  for better or worse. I guess that probably remains to be seen. But, uh, yeah, I think,
[06:16.580 --> 06:21.300]  uh, I think pastrami days are, are in the rearview mirror. Do you think you'll try and replace it?
[06:23.020 --> 06:27.760]  I mean, I wasn't trying to find it in the first place. It just fell into my lap, you know?
[06:28.780 --> 06:35.980]  Have you ever had this happen with another food? Uh, no, yeah. Well, I mean, I went through a
[06:35.980 --> 06:40.440]  natural life cycle with corndogs, right? Where, like, I loved them for most of my life, and then
[06:40.440 --> 06:46.300]  I realized that I, I think I just was done with them. But I, I kind of felt that happening
[06:46.300 --> 06:51.060]  gradually over time. Like, I enjoyed each corndog a little bit less than the previous one, where
[06:51.060 --> 06:54.180]  it's like, kind of like San Francisco. The first time I ever went to San Francisco when I was,
[06:54.260 --> 06:59.320]  like, 19 or 20, I was on tour with that, with the band I used to tour with. And I had the best night
[06:59.320 --> 07:03.200]  of my life. And I thought, someday I will move to San Francisco. I will live in this city. This
[07:03.200 --> 07:06.640]  is the greatest place on earth. And the next time I went to San Francisco, I was like, that's,
[07:06.760 --> 07:10.840]  like, 80% as good as I remember that night. And then it just got, like, 5% shittier each time,
[07:10.860 --> 07:14.260]  now that I'm like, I don't ever need to go to San Francisco again, as long as I live. Thank
[07:14.260 --> 07:19.300]  God I never made the mistake to move there. So your life is just a series of diminishing returns?
[07:20.000 --> 07:26.880]  Yeah, I guess so, you know? Like, like the... I felt like the corndog thing happened naturally
[07:26.880 --> 07:33.380]  and gradually, whereas this was a shock to my system. And I really... I really thought that
[07:33.380 --> 07:42.460]  if I could get over the physical, like, revulsion from the memory of the intense vomiting that day,
[07:42.620 --> 07:48.660]  that I could get back to, you know, like, sunny day, sunny pastrami days again. And it was a
[07:48.660 --> 07:55.060]  pretty... God, it was pretty depressing, if I'm being honest with you. It was a sad car ride home
[07:55.060 --> 07:59.680]  that day. Well, it's a different experience, you know? Unlike the San Francisco thing, you could
[07:59.680 --> 08:04.980]  probably say the city changed as well as you. This is a situation in which you have changed,
[08:05.080 --> 08:09.680]  the sandwich is the same. It's just, it's not, it's not for you anymore. Andrew, do you worry
[08:09.680 --> 08:17.960]  about that happening with us? What? Like, you've come here before, you've met us before. Do you
[08:17.960 --> 08:21.380]  worry that if, when you come again, is that why you're putting it off? Because when you come here
[08:21.380 --> 08:27.100]  again, it won't be as good? No, it's no, it's no different. I don't understand the question.
[08:27.420 --> 08:32.160]  I've never... What if you've changed or we've changed? We've talked every week and throughout
[08:32.160 --> 08:35.920]  the week for the past, like, two and a half years, three years, however long we've done this.
[08:36.160 --> 08:40.320]  I don't, it's too constant. There's been no break period. Well, it's been a break of interacting
[08:40.320 --> 08:45.060]  in real life. Yeah, but I mean, that's not all that socially different. It's the same,
[08:45.240 --> 08:50.160]  we're the same people. I don't think I would change anything. I will say, I will say you
[08:50.160 --> 08:55.260]  stopped talking to me for like two years for no reason. That was prior. And we were able to pick,
[08:55.360 --> 09:01.440]  pick right back up. So yeah. Yeah. Although I wonder if maybe Gavin, are you worried that
[09:01.440 --> 09:05.780]  that'll happen on your end with Andrew? Like you'll see him, we'll like in November, we'll go to
[09:05.780 --> 09:11.300]  Canada or he'll come here and you'll go like, oh no, I remembered liking him more. No, I don't,
[09:11.400 --> 09:15.860]  I'm not worried about that. I'm not worried about that either. I'm worried about it being weird.
[09:15.860 --> 09:21.040]  What do you mean? I'm worried about it being weird when we try and make one of these in person.
[09:21.300 --> 09:25.600]  Oh, in person? Oh, well, I don't know that we should ever make a face in person. I think
[09:25.600 --> 09:29.380]  we should make ancillary content, shoulder content, but maybe not the main. We should
[09:29.380 --> 09:35.440]  never make a podcast in person. No, I don't know that we should. I like the idea of if we do it
[09:35.440 --> 09:39.960]  in person, we need to like create cardboard walls between us. Like it still needs to,
[09:40.080 --> 09:43.140]  even though we're physically in the same space, there needs to be a removal.
[09:46.660 --> 09:53.100]  A triangle. Has anybody ever done a reverse triangle podcast where the hosts all look
[09:53.100 --> 09:57.320]  out away from each other? Why don't we do one facing each other and one facing away
[09:57.320 --> 10:00.780]  and see which one's better? That's a great idea. Now, that I would do.
[10:02.120 --> 10:05.620]  I think it'll be fine though, because humans are more complex than pastrami.
[10:05.680 --> 10:10.120]  So I think that they'll, I'm not afraid of things being weird between us ever.
[10:10.480 --> 10:14.340]  I don't, well, no, I guess it's not. I'm trying to think if I've ever had a moment with food
[10:14.340 --> 10:19.360]  where it's been a true, it's not you, it's me. Because I think you still think the pastrami
[10:19.360 --> 10:23.920]  sandwich in the realm of sandwiches is good. It's just not for you. Is that fair?
[10:24.360 --> 10:28.860]  Yeah, it's still beautiful. I still think it's, yeah, it's just, it's just not for,
[10:28.960 --> 10:33.380]  you're right. I've changed. It's not you, pastrami, it's me. Which would be the,
[10:33.480 --> 10:36.500]  that's the new name of my, that would be the name of my second autobiography.
[10:36.500 --> 10:37.920]  It's not you, pastrami, it's me.
[10:40.680 --> 10:45.500]  So should we get into this alphabet thing? Because we've teased it, we've gone on for
[10:45.500 --> 10:49.320]  multiple weeks with it, and it sounds, based on what you've said, that there might be some
[10:49.960 --> 10:53.560]  debates and arguments relating to how this is going to proceed.
[10:53.560 --> 10:59.500]  So, so I went, Emily and I went to dinner with Eric and his small wife Barbara recently,
[10:59.860 --> 11:04.900]  and we actually went to our double date spot, Gavin, our shabu shabu place.
[11:05.560 --> 11:08.160]  Uh, by the way, Eric, did you guys like that? Did you guys enjoy it?
[11:08.400 --> 11:11.580]  Oh, that was, that was awesome. I'm, I'm gonna, I gotta go back.
[11:11.900 --> 11:14.420]  Do you think I would have liked it if it was me there instead of you?
[11:16.160 --> 11:20.080]  Well, I mean, I guess that would be, here's the thing, that, that would mean you would have to
[11:20.080 --> 11:24.800]  show up for the double date, and I don't know, I haven't seen a lot of evidence of that. I've
[11:24.800 --> 11:29.700]  just seen evidence of you not showing up, honestly. So, but you know what? I'll say,
[11:29.760 --> 11:32.760]  yeah, I think you would have liked it. It was lovely.
[11:32.760 --> 11:36.880]  That reminds me of a side thing, not to completely detract from this. I thought
[11:36.880 --> 11:42.060]  this was interesting. I was talking to Gavin after we recorded the episode in which you got your
[11:42.060 --> 11:44.140]  guilt basket, Geoff. Yeah.
[11:44.240 --> 11:50.360]  And I was asking him his opinions on PS5 games. Gavin doesn't own a PS5.
[11:52.160 --> 11:54.320]  He doesn't have one. Well, I did.
[11:55.100 --> 12:01.120]  He, he did have one. I was shocked by this, and I've been going back and forth on trying
[12:01.120 --> 12:05.860]  to decide if that made the gesture better or worse. He didn't buy that for you. He,
[12:06.080 --> 12:12.780]  that was his PS5 that he just had for a while, and then he thought it would be, it would fit this.
[12:12.920 --> 12:14.340]  Oh yeah. So he applied it to this.
[12:14.520 --> 12:19.720]  I had it, no, well, it arrived, and I thought, oh, I'm excited. I've been trying for about two
[12:19.720 --> 12:23.620]  years to get one of these, and I finally got the opportunity to get one. But then it was just a much
[12:23.620 --> 12:30.220]  better f*** face to myself to immediately give it away as a super inappropriate sorry gift.
[12:30.220 --> 12:31.840]  It's just way more funny to me.
[12:33.340 --> 12:33.920]  That's true.
[12:34.220 --> 12:38.920]  And for the record, I assumed, here's what I assumed. I assumed because Gavin and Meg are
[12:38.920 --> 12:44.080]  in, in the industry as it were, and both very successful, I assumed that they were probably
[12:44.080 --> 12:48.620]  like a garage with like eight PlayStation 5s. They just keep getting, they just keep getting
[12:48.620 --> 12:54.680]  free PS5s from people. Like, like back in the day, back in the, like the earlier days of Achievement
[12:54.680 --> 12:58.820]  Hunter, Microsoft would give us f***ing Xboxes like candy. Like there would be, there was a
[12:58.820 --> 13:04.940]  time when I had like 13 Xboxes, right? And I just assumed it was like just on the pile of PS5s at
[13:04.940 --> 13:08.540]  his house. And I didn't think it diminished the gesture in any way whatsoever.
[13:09.020 --> 13:13.980]  Okay, well that's what, I was just shocked. I was stunned to hear that he doesn't have one,
[13:14.220 --> 13:16.980]  has never played a PS5 game. Completely caught me off guard.
[13:17.280 --> 13:19.680]  They're a lot easier to get now, so I think I can get another one.
[13:19.880 --> 13:20.600]  I'll let you borrow mine.
[13:20.760 --> 13:20.940]  That was funny.
[13:22.460 --> 13:27.620]  Geoff, you can drive in Gavin's car, pick up Gavin, and then drive back in his car to play
[13:27.620 --> 13:28.340]  your PS5.
[13:28.340 --> 13:30.430]  That's absolutely true. That's what we can do.
[13:32.220 --> 13:33.780]  Andrew was blown away there.
[13:34.140 --> 13:39.900]  I was stunned. I couldn't process it, because like you said, I assumed that they had a room
[13:39.900 --> 13:44.820]  filled with PS5s. That there was maybe even a consideration to fix the hole in his wall
[13:44.820 --> 13:47.500]  with his PS5, because he has so many of them.
[13:47.820 --> 13:52.020]  That is sort of what I imagine. A house filled with PS5s. I'm shocked.
[13:52.300 --> 13:52.680]  Zero.
[13:53.300 --> 13:54.860]  Do you have a PS5, Andrew?
[13:55.080 --> 13:56.240]  I don't.
[13:56.260 --> 13:57.380]  Well, I know how you can get one.
[13:58.860 --> 14:01.100]  Well, I'm never going to be late again, so it's not going to work.
[14:01.620 --> 14:02.360]  It's a fair test.
[14:02.420 --> 14:03.900]  We're not late. I'll never get a no-show again.
[14:04.340 --> 14:11.820]  Yeah. So we go to dinner, and it's a lovely little dinner at our favorite place. It was
[14:11.820 --> 14:14.640]  fucking awesome. It had been a minute since we'd been there, so I was thoroughly enjoying
[14:14.640 --> 14:18.340]  it. And then, quite naturally, throughout the course of the dinner, the alphabet...
[14:22.880 --> 14:30.940]  I just... it just came to me. The alphabet just came up. It came up naturally, and we
[14:30.940 --> 14:37.940]  got to talking about it. And I realized that we're going to wade into some contentious
[14:37.940 --> 14:41.320]  territory, I think, when we start naming what foods we can eat.
[14:41.740 --> 14:43.100]  Alphabet is such a good name.
[14:43.440 --> 14:44.100]  Isn't that a great name?
[14:44.360 --> 14:45.320]  It's a great name.
[14:45.320 --> 14:54.940]  Yeah. Eric and I, I realized we're not of the same mind on what stuff is. Like, for
[14:54.940 --> 15:01.900]  instance, if you draw... if you pull an O, you pull an O, right? And you have to eat
[15:01.900 --> 15:06.180]  only things that start with the letter O for the next however many days. Can you eat an
[15:06.180 --> 15:06.440]  Oreo?
[15:07.080 --> 15:07.280]  Yeah.
[15:07.820 --> 15:08.060]  Yeah.
[15:08.520 --> 15:09.100]  Eric says no.
[15:09.400 --> 15:10.640]  Oh, you can't do brand names?
[15:10.640 --> 15:15.940]  Well, here... see, here's the thing. This is between the three of you. I, when presented
[15:15.940 --> 15:22.420]  with this information, Oreo is a cookie. You have to... yes. So Nick is right. Is he thinking
[15:22.420 --> 15:28.580]  cookie? Yeah. I'm thinking of what the thing is, because I think that everyone's going
[15:28.580 --> 15:33.860]  to go into like, well, I got T. Okay, well, I'm going to eat Tyson chicken. Like, I think
[15:33.860 --> 15:40.800]  it gets too granular when you go to that. Because then you can kind of make everything
[15:40.800 --> 15:46.700]  into everything. But, again, this is between the three of you, and I want to know where
[15:46.700 --> 15:50.260]  you stand. Because here's the thing, when it's just the three of you, there's a tie
[15:50.260 --> 15:53.160]  breaker. There's a natural... there has to be a natural tie breaker between three.
[15:53.660 --> 15:54.260]  Good point.
[15:54.320 --> 15:55.540]  That's why I want to know where that stands.
[15:56.020 --> 15:58.960]  Cookie. Well, I guess for me, it'd be a biscuit. It'd be B.
[15:59.820 --> 16:02.200]  I think if you held up...
[16:02.200 --> 16:03.640]  That makes it even more complicated.
[16:03.880 --> 16:04.680]  Yeah, that's it.
[16:05.660 --> 16:08.560]  Am I allowed to use my own culture's words?
[16:09.260 --> 16:14.880]  That's a very funny you say that, because I was explaining this idea to my mom yesterday
[16:14.880 --> 16:22.400]  of this bet we're going to do. And she immediately started feeding me food items in different
[16:22.400 --> 16:27.480]  languages. Being like, ah, chocolate in this language starts with an X. You got X covered.
[16:27.480 --> 16:29.440]  We're talking about some of the harder letters.
[16:29.500 --> 16:35.060]  So you're telling me that salad creaming is like in your blood? Like it's been passed
[16:35.060 --> 16:37.700]  down to you from your mother? Like that's incredible.
[16:37.700 --> 16:40.120]  Would salad cream be S or C for cream?
[16:41.460 --> 16:42.960]  It depends on what language you're using.
[16:44.120 --> 16:50.740]  Or D for dressing, right? Like it gets... or even like, let's stick it with Oreos.
[16:50.900 --> 16:54.600]  Like if you get C for cookie, right? Can you eat an Oreo?
[16:54.840 --> 16:56.660]  Or with C, can I eat a tater tot?
[16:56.660 --> 17:02.020]  So this is, I think, a great sort of rule for this. You're the worst.
[17:03.240 --> 17:04.200]  You're a menace.
[17:05.920 --> 17:10.220]  I heard somebody comment saying like a good qualifier could be what it would be listed
[17:10.220 --> 17:13.220]  in a grocery store. Like for the display sign.
[17:14.260 --> 17:18.920]  That is what I said. I said to me it's based on the aisle. Because Geoff was like,
[17:19.000 --> 17:22.080]  well, what about like a Kit Kat? I'm like, that's candy. Do you get it from
[17:22.080 --> 17:25.020]  the Kit Kat aisle? No, you get it from the candy.
[17:25.020 --> 17:28.840]  Like to me, that's where it lands. But again, this is between the three of you.
[17:28.920 --> 17:30.840]  I can just, I can only offer input like that.
[17:30.980 --> 17:34.980]  I think, and I know this is wild for me to be the one saying this.
[17:35.540 --> 17:38.820]  Just, we just kind of, I think, know what is and isn't bullshit.
[17:38.920 --> 17:39.640]  I disagree.
[17:39.880 --> 17:42.580]  And anything, and anything that is...
[17:42.580 --> 17:47.580]  No, because like if you, there'd be nothing lamer than if you get M and then you just eat
[17:47.580 --> 17:51.460]  every meat available. That sucks. I don't think you could do that.
[17:51.600 --> 17:54.580]  Andrew, I think you're the last person that should be giving this speech.
[17:54.580 --> 17:59.320]  No, I agree. That's why I opened it with this. I agree completely. You're totally right.
[17:59.440 --> 18:03.080]  But it's a good point. Like M, can I eat M&Ms or does that fall under C for candy?
[18:03.400 --> 18:07.940]  No, that's M&Ms. Those are M&Ms. I don't think this is, I think we're overcomplicating it.
[18:08.000 --> 18:14.000]  I think we know what starts with what. And if there's any confusion, why don't we do a thing?
[18:15.080 --> 18:18.460]  Is there a point system for this? How is this working?
[18:18.640 --> 18:19.700]  That sounds complicated.
[18:19.920 --> 18:23.980]  You just said we're overcomplicating it and then said, is there a point system?
[18:23.980 --> 18:30.500]  Surely like me eating a Red Baron pizza is pizza. I'm not going to go R, right?
[18:31.260 --> 18:35.200]  Right. But then why is M&M an M and not C for candy?
[18:35.620 --> 18:36.960]  Yeah, that should be chocolate or candy.
[18:37.160 --> 18:43.920]  See, that's what I'm saying. And I think that because to me it excludes one way or the other.
[18:44.020 --> 18:49.000]  Like if you take Oreo, for instance, it's either O for Oreo or it's C for cookie,
[18:49.360 --> 18:50.700]  but in no way can it be both.
[18:50.700 --> 18:54.100]  Right. Something can't be both. Like here's another example. S for Snickers,
[18:54.340 --> 18:58.120]  or is it C for candy or B for bar?
[18:58.620 --> 18:59.980]  So I think we just need to make a ruling.
[19:00.060 --> 19:02.820]  Or C for chocolate. Is Snickers chocolate?
[19:03.220 --> 19:04.260]  B for bar.
[19:04.540 --> 19:05.780]  B for bar?
[19:07.940 --> 19:15.900]  I think we go with brand names. How about this? We make note of everything that we have
[19:15.900 --> 19:23.420]  for a letter. We submit it to each other each day. And if there's a ruling on an item,
[19:23.840 --> 19:29.400]  two of three agree that that's not it, then it's out. Maybe you get negative points.
[19:30.060 --> 19:31.960]  Is sushi S or is it fish?
[19:32.500 --> 19:33.000]  It's sushi.
[19:33.060 --> 19:34.920]  I guess it's always fish and sushi, I guess.
[19:35.260 --> 19:35.360]  Okay.
[19:35.600 --> 19:36.520]  Yes, that's easy.
[19:37.040 --> 19:40.820]  You keep coming back to a point system and it really has me worried.
[19:40.860 --> 19:43.580]  Well, because I'm trying to determine a penalty for...
[19:44.360 --> 19:44.680]  Right.
[19:44.680 --> 19:47.600]  If you just fuck up, then how do we keep track of...
[19:47.600 --> 19:50.660]  Because if we all make mistakes, there has to be a differentiator.
[19:50.900 --> 19:54.160]  How about this idea? How about this idea? Because I agree with you on principle.
[19:54.600 --> 20:01.520]  How about this? We... I'll just lay it all out. Okay. So we get the bingo wheel.
[20:02.800 --> 20:07.860]  We get the 26 numbers in. Everybody gets to pull out one number that's associated with that letter.
[20:08.400 --> 20:14.120]  Let's say from this point on on Friday till Monday morning at 9 a.m. or whatever the
[20:14.120 --> 20:18.220]  date range we associate, we can only eat foods that start with that letter, right?
[20:20.060 --> 20:25.580]  You write down or photograph everything that you eat throughout the weekend, right?
[20:25.640 --> 20:30.400]  And then on Monday or whenever we record next, we reconcile it like this.
[20:30.480 --> 20:34.420]  We look at the full list of everything everybody eats and we do the two-thirds majority
[20:34.420 --> 20:40.780]  and we go through and you get a strikeout on anything that you eat that is determined
[20:41.860 --> 20:47.540]  to be wrong. And then whoever has the least strikeouts wins.
[20:49.580 --> 20:54.120]  It's not like a point system. It's more like we're punishing people
[20:54.120 --> 20:59.460]  for eating the wrong thing and whoever ate the least wrong things wins.
[20:59.740 --> 21:03.700]  And we're relying on the fact that two of three of us will agree that something is bullshit.
[21:03.700 --> 21:05.220]  It's in majority rules, right?
[21:05.280 --> 21:11.160]  If it's 50-50, then you don't get a strike. Should we do a three-strike penalty?
[21:11.600 --> 21:14.320]  Three strikes, you're out type thing. You're immediately out if you get three.
[21:14.920 --> 21:17.340]  So that could build tension. If I could just take strikes all day.
[21:17.580 --> 21:20.700]  If Gavin has 12 strikes, I could eat two or three strikes.
[21:21.200 --> 21:25.800]  Well, we won't know. I think ideally we don't know about the strikes till we record the podcast.
[21:25.820 --> 21:29.080]  Oh, so do we submit our strikes to Eric?
[21:29.440 --> 21:33.040]  I don't think we submit our foods. I don't think we submit our foods until the day.
[21:33.040 --> 21:35.120]  What we did in the recording.
[21:35.620 --> 21:35.720]  Yeah.
[21:36.220 --> 21:43.920]  Oh, we do the strikes? Okay. I thought you meant the idea of we send our items to Eric.
[21:44.820 --> 21:48.840]  No, we send the items to each other and then we tell our strikes to Eric,
[21:48.960 --> 21:52.320]  so Eric knows how many strikes we all have, but we don't collect them.
[21:52.320 --> 21:54.340]  I think it's better to get our reactions as we record.
[21:55.620 --> 21:56.340]  Yeah, I agree.
[21:56.720 --> 22:00.340]  And that's a game you can play. If you get P for pizza,
[22:00.720 --> 22:06.400]  but you really want some shrimp on Saturday, you can eat that shrimp and take the hit and
[22:06.400 --> 22:08.880]  just hope that you're taking less hits than the other players, you know?
[22:09.060 --> 22:09.760]  Or have a prawn.
[22:09.840 --> 22:16.980]  That's a calculated gamble. Oh, or you have a king prawn. But yeah, I think the reveal all
[22:16.980 --> 22:21.920]  has to happen live while we record. So I think that should be the parameters.
[22:22.140 --> 22:25.520]  I also... We talked about doing it for a week. I don't want to waste a week. I have
[22:25.520 --> 22:29.300]  dinner reservations and shit at places. So I was just thinking the weekend would work.
[22:29.300 --> 22:33.380]  Do we want to do it from the second this podcast ends until like...
[22:33.380 --> 22:36.420]  Oh no, we're going a week. We can't just do a weekend. We can't shorten it.
[22:36.740 --> 22:40.180]  That's bullshit. We got to go a week. A weekend?
[22:40.880 --> 22:42.380]  Monday to when we record.
[22:42.780 --> 22:42.960]  Yeah.
[22:43.080 --> 22:46.460]  So it starts Monday and then it goes until next Thursday.
[22:46.860 --> 22:47.300]  I think...
[22:47.300 --> 22:49.440]  Oh shit, I'm filming all next week.
[22:49.600 --> 22:51.320]  Oh, see, that's what I'm saying.
[22:51.760 --> 22:52.640]  Filming all next week.
[22:52.660 --> 22:54.860]  I got to be ordering. You're the worst.
[22:55.340 --> 22:56.140]  Oh dear.
[22:56.520 --> 22:58.100]  That's what I'm saying.
[22:58.100 --> 23:00.480]  I got nothing this weekend, but time...
[23:00.480 --> 23:03.280]  I don't... I think the weekend is lame, though. I don't think that's enough time.
[23:03.380 --> 23:05.480]  We need more time than just three days.
[23:05.800 --> 23:08.860]  I kind of agree with Andrew, how annoying that is for my schedule.
[23:08.940 --> 23:15.660]  So let's start Monday, first thing Monday morning, and go till the recording on Thursday.
[23:17.440 --> 23:17.840]  Or...
[23:17.840 --> 23:18.560]  Monday to Wednesday.
[23:18.580 --> 23:20.200]  Dinner reservations. You don't want to fuck up.
[23:20.380 --> 23:24.600]  It's fine. I'll live with it. I'll find something on the menu that I can eat.
[23:24.700 --> 23:26.320]  I mean, that's kind of the point of the challenge, right?
[23:27.460 --> 23:28.920]  I just hope I'm going...
[23:28.920 --> 23:29.440]  I love that idea.
[23:29.480 --> 23:33.420]  I'm taking Milly out for sushi on Monday night, so I hope I get a fucking S.
[23:33.900 --> 23:36.380]  And are we saying you can't have the same item of food twice?
[23:38.420 --> 23:39.900]  I think that's overly complicated.
[23:40.220 --> 23:42.220]  Yeah, I think you can do what you want to.
[23:42.660 --> 23:44.240]  So I can just have four pieces?
[23:44.940 --> 23:45.860]  If you get P, yeah.
[23:46.620 --> 23:49.400]  I guess so. You say I only ate pizza for...
[23:49.400 --> 23:50.040]  I only ate pizza.
[23:50.380 --> 23:50.640]  Four days.
[23:50.640 --> 23:51.180]  I think that works.
[23:51.220 --> 23:55.480]  I'm going to try and get a different piece of food every time, just in case bonus points
[23:55.480 --> 23:56.240]  become a part of it.
[23:56.940 --> 24:01.720]  Also, I've heard other comments of like suggesting we could do this multiple weeks and just like
[24:01.720 --> 24:03.720]  remove them from the pool if we want to.
[24:03.800 --> 24:06.500]  I feel like there's room that we could expand on this if we want to.
[24:07.200 --> 24:09.080]  Yeah, we'll remember which ones we had.
[24:09.440 --> 24:11.420]  Yeah, I just will not put them back in the hopper.
[24:11.700 --> 24:12.100]  That's great.
[24:12.480 --> 24:18.680]  This feels like the first iteration of what could be a lot of content going forward.
[24:18.820 --> 24:23.540]  Like, you know, when Eric and I were getting into this and heavily disagreeing at dinner
[24:23.540 --> 24:30.960]  the other night, we did both agree that a contest where we could only eat, we go and
[24:30.960 --> 24:33.700]  we can only eat from one aisle at the grocery store is a great idea.
[24:34.160 --> 24:37.760]  And like, we all just randomly get the aisle and whatever aisle you get is what you're
[24:37.760 --> 24:38.100]  stuck with.
[24:38.280 --> 24:40.940]  So I think there's a lot of different ways, a lot of different offshoots we can do, a
[24:40.940 --> 24:42.520]  lot of different versions of this going forward.
[24:42.860 --> 24:45.020]  This is just be like our first one.
[24:50.400 --> 24:51.120]  It's summer.
[24:51.500 --> 24:52.140]  Lighten up.
[24:52.660 --> 24:54.360]  Dead grass is great anytime.
[24:54.360 --> 24:59.440]  They can help you chill out before a big meeting or be a new replacement to that evening glass
[24:59.440 --> 24:59.840]  of wine.
[25:00.380 --> 25:03.060]  They are the perfect pairing to everything summer has to offer.
[25:03.800 --> 25:08.460]  Dead grass is a legal, organic hemp that relaxes your body and mellows your mind.

[26:03.840 --> 26:07.080]  When you use the bathroom, you always close the door behind you, right?
[26:07.500 --> 26:09.500]  You don't want random passerbys looking in on you.
[26:09.720 --> 26:13.240]  This is, I think, generally completely true, obviously, in the context that you're using
[26:13.240 --> 26:13.380]  it.
[26:13.560 --> 26:15.520]  There is an exception when you're making bathroom waffles.
[26:15.640 --> 26:16.440]  You want the door open.
[26:16.440 --> 26:18.080]  You just want that smell to go through your space.
[26:18.340 --> 26:19.100]  It's fantastic.
[26:19.480 --> 26:21.700]  But any other context, definitely want the door closed.
[26:22.060 --> 26:24.820]  So why would you let people look in on you when you go online?
[26:25.160 --> 26:28.920]  Using the internet without ExpressVPN is like going to the bathroom and not closing the
[26:28.920 --> 26:29.100]  door.
[26:29.780 --> 26:33.600]  Did you know that your internet service provider knows every single website you visit?
[26:33.980 --> 26:37.360]  And what's worse is they can sell this information to ad companies and tech giants
[26:37.360 --> 26:39.620]  who will use your data to target you.
[26:40.460 --> 26:42.200]  ExpressVPN puts a stop to this.
[26:42.200 --> 26:46.780]  It creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet so that your
[26:46.780 --> 26:49.400]  online activity can't be seen by anyone.
[26:49.980 --> 26:52.120]  I use ExpressVPN on all my devices.
[26:52.340 --> 26:53.120]  It works on everything.
[26:53.340 --> 26:55.080]  Phones, laptops, even routers.
[26:55.140 --> 27:00.320]  So everyone who shares your Wi-Fi can still be protected even if they don't have ExpressVPN.
[27:01.100 --> 27:04.240]  I love ExpressVPN to access content libraries and other regions.
[27:04.360 --> 27:05.040]  It's perfect for that.
[27:05.120 --> 27:07.500]  It was how I was able to watch the most recent Spelling Bee.
[27:07.920 --> 27:09.000]  It's a fantastic service.
[27:09.000 --> 27:14.220]  And the best part is, using ExpressVPN is as easy as closing the bathroom door.
[27:14.720 --> 27:18.300]  You just fire up the app, click one button, and you're protected.
[27:18.900 --> 27:24.420]  ExpressVPN is the world's number one rated VPN by Mashable, The Verge, and countless
[27:24.420 --> 27:24.960]  others.

[29:04.220 --> 29:06.000]  So do we pick numbers today?
[29:06.160 --> 29:06.720]  Do we pick now?
[29:07.080 --> 29:08.840]  I think so.
[29:09.000 --> 29:09.740]  I got the machine.
[29:09.860 --> 29:11.780]  I had to pull the fucking thing out of my closet.
[29:12.340 --> 29:14.440]  I went through, made sure I had the balls.
[29:14.600 --> 29:18.780]  I was missing the three, so I put a 33 in to represent three.
[29:19.200 --> 29:20.620]  So we're all on the same page.
[29:20.880 --> 29:24.520]  So we have one, two, four through 26 and 33.
[29:25.160 --> 29:26.380]  Yeah, one, one.
[29:26.500 --> 29:29.900]  Yeah, everything is there outside of the three.
[29:29.900 --> 29:31.360]  It's a 33 is the three.
[29:31.520 --> 29:33.520]  Everything else is represented as it should.
[29:33.940 --> 29:35.120]  OK, I would like that.
[29:35.220 --> 29:38.100]  Could we could we have like a photo of like what alphabet thing is where?
[29:38.280 --> 29:38.660]  What number?
[29:39.420 --> 29:41.880]  Because I don't know off the top of my head what fucking 16 is.
[29:42.320 --> 29:43.240]  Oh, I see.
[29:43.300 --> 29:47.500]  OK, I thought you meant for like like so that we're all clear.
[29:47.660 --> 29:48.520]  OK, I understand.
[29:48.660 --> 29:50.020]  Now, let me let me grab something.
[29:50.300 --> 29:52.040]  Yeah, just to post in just so we can look at.
[29:53.620 --> 29:55.540]  While you do that, I will position myself.
[29:55.860 --> 29:59.640]  Do you want me to make this spin for a little bit or just immediate is fine?
[29:59.900 --> 30:00.680]  I think it should spin.
[30:01.340 --> 30:04.000]  OK, so I'm going to it's going to be so fucking loud.
[30:04.120 --> 30:04.940]  I'm warning you.
[30:04.980 --> 30:05.940]  Who are we pulling for first?
[30:06.300 --> 30:07.340]  That's a great question.
[30:07.720 --> 30:08.620]  Who wants to go first?
[30:09.260 --> 30:11.080]  Well, and also do Eric and Nick want to participate?
[30:11.280 --> 30:13.420]  Eric said no, but I want to offer Nick the opportunity.
[30:13.760 --> 30:14.580]  No, absolutely not.
[30:14.700 --> 30:14.860]  No.
[30:15.980 --> 30:19.080]  OK, so that you're just going to help us judge, I guess.
[30:19.480 --> 30:20.540]  OK, yeah, yeah.
[30:20.580 --> 30:21.200]  I like.
[30:22.180 --> 30:23.580]  Oh, Nick, I have a kid.
[30:23.600 --> 30:24.640]  I have a kid too, Nick.
[30:25.060 --> 30:26.800]  Yeah, but you're not Ian Milley's leftovers.
[30:28.220 --> 30:28.780]  That's true.
[30:28.780 --> 30:31.360]  Yeah, I'll help you guys judge if you need help.
[30:31.460 --> 30:32.720]  But I think you probably got that.
[30:32.920 --> 30:33.300]  OK, that's OK.
[30:33.360 --> 30:35.260]  That's just I'm here to watch people suffer.
[30:35.380 --> 30:36.420]  So who wants to go first?
[30:37.280 --> 30:38.460]  Well, let's do a test.
[30:38.740 --> 30:39.340]  Let's do a test.
[30:39.540 --> 30:42.060]  Can we is there is it possible we can see you pulling the numbers?
[30:42.140 --> 30:42.680]  Is there any way to?
[30:43.400 --> 30:45.060]  I don't know how I would do that.
[30:45.500 --> 30:46.360]  OK, that's not a problem.
[30:46.420 --> 30:49.920]  Like a webcam or something connected to your phone.
[30:50.300 --> 30:52.300]  I could record the video.
[30:52.620 --> 30:53.860]  Just record your hand doing it or something.
[30:54.020 --> 30:55.500]  Yeah, record your hand doing it.
[30:55.520 --> 30:56.640]  It's a machine pulling.
[30:56.840 --> 30:57.960]  I'm not touching anything.
[30:59.320 --> 31:02.420]  Oh, I don't have to push a button or spin a wheel or something.
[31:02.700 --> 31:03.640]  You have to hit a button.
[31:03.740 --> 31:05.620]  But I'm saying like it's not like my hand.
[31:05.720 --> 31:08.460]  Yeah, but record that process and see it come out.
[31:09.080 --> 31:13.900]  I was more worried about the implication that I somehow was pulling specific things.
[31:14.220 --> 31:17.200]  But if you show us the fucking video, then we'll have it already.
[31:17.280 --> 31:19.040]  Yeah, if we overlay it, we'll know it's legit.
[31:19.380 --> 31:21.860]  Yeah. Do you want do you want us to?
[31:21.960 --> 31:24.860]  I don't need to see the video right now, but like just record it.
[31:25.700 --> 31:27.240]  Actually, it would be nice if you upload.
[31:27.240 --> 31:27.860]  Well, whatever.
[31:28.480 --> 31:29.860]  I'll defer to the others for that.
[31:29.940 --> 31:33.300]  But I say we do one as a test right now and just see what it would be.
[31:34.280 --> 31:35.000]  Why are we doing?
[31:35.120 --> 31:35.840]  Why aren't we going in?
[31:36.020 --> 31:36.960]  Let's just do it now.
[31:37.100 --> 31:37.760]  Let's just do it.
[31:37.920 --> 31:38.320]  There's no...
[31:38.320 --> 31:39.700]  Okay, Gavin goes first.
[31:40.060 --> 31:40.540]  Why am I going?
[31:40.620 --> 31:41.140]  Okay, sweet.
[31:41.160 --> 31:41.580]  Yeah, that's great.
[31:41.640 --> 31:42.100]  Because I got...
[31:42.100 --> 31:43.080]  Yeah, I'll go first.
[31:43.740 --> 31:46.120]  So I assume you're setting up a little video.
[31:46.640 --> 31:47.800]  Yeah, narrate, narrate, narrate this.
[31:47.800 --> 31:50.220]  Okay, now I'm now recording the wheel.
[31:50.580 --> 31:50.880]  Okay.
[31:51.220 --> 31:52.160]  I'm hitting the button.
[31:53.840 --> 31:54.940]  Oh, sounds good.
[31:54.940 --> 31:55.600]  Oh my god.
[31:55.600 --> 31:57.380]  It's so fucking loud.
[31:57.440 --> 31:58.660]  It is so loud.
[31:59.600 --> 32:00.380]  Get me a good one.
[32:00.620 --> 32:03.200]  Okay, we got, we got two numbers came out.
[32:03.340 --> 32:03.860]  We'll just do the...
[32:03.860 --> 32:04.700]  Oh, it went back in.
[32:05.400 --> 32:05.920]  Gavin got...
[32:07.800 --> 32:08.280]  Seven.
[32:08.860 --> 32:09.860]  Whatever seven is.
[32:10.060 --> 32:10.540]  G.
[32:12.260 --> 32:12.740]  G.
[32:15.100 --> 32:15.580]  G.
[32:17.800 --> 32:18.580]  That's perfect.
[32:19.000 --> 32:20.220]  I could try some Gaviscon.
[32:23.500 --> 32:26.600]  What are foods that start with G? I'm trying to blank.
[32:29.960 --> 32:30.400]  Grain.
[32:30.840 --> 32:35.620]  Yeah, like garlic, grapes, grapefruit, guava.
[32:36.380 --> 32:37.320]  See, here's where it gets confusing.
[32:37.860 --> 32:38.300]  Ginger.
[32:38.620 --> 32:40.080]  Can you have green peppers?
[32:40.280 --> 32:42.020]  I would say so.
[32:42.340 --> 32:43.720]  Or is that P for pepper?
[32:44.160 --> 32:45.780]  That's so, that's just ingredients.
[32:46.450 --> 32:50.300]  G, gelatin, gouda cheese, goat.
[32:51.920 --> 32:52.420]  Grits.
[32:52.580 --> 32:52.620]  Yeah.
[32:52.760 --> 32:53.520]  Oh, gummy bears.
[32:53.920 --> 32:54.880]  Can you have gummy bears?
[32:55.760 --> 32:56.360]  I don't know.
[32:56.960 --> 32:58.460]  That's a terrible letter, I think.
[32:58.880 --> 32:59.780]  I think it is, dude.
[32:59.860 --> 33:00.420]  I think you're in trouble.
[33:00.760 --> 33:01.080]  Gravy.
[33:02.360 --> 33:05.000]  Dude, you're gonna eat so much garlic.
[33:05.840 --> 33:11.420]  Andrew and I just watched the season finale of the USA challenge, the new challenge season.
[33:11.420 --> 33:17.800]  And on the last episode, they had to hike 10 miles up a mountain in the snow in Patagonia.
[33:17.960 --> 33:22.160]  And halfway through, they had to stop and eat an entire onion and 10 cloves of garlic.
[33:22.900 --> 33:25.820]  And I have never seen people throw up as much in my entire life.
[33:26.460 --> 33:28.420]  So be careful how much garlic you eat.
[33:28.700 --> 33:29.800]  Are we ready for the next drop?
[33:30.220 --> 33:31.320]  Yeah, are you filming still?
[33:31.880 --> 33:32.300]  Yeah.
[33:33.120 --> 33:34.560]  So who's the next one, me or Andrew?
[33:34.880 --> 33:36.400]  You're not putting G back in.
[33:36.700 --> 33:40.200]  No, I'm just making sure that we're all on the same page.
[33:41.500 --> 33:43.080]  All right, so this is for Geoff.
[33:43.340 --> 33:44.440]  This is for Geoff.
[33:49.080 --> 33:51.360]  There's no doubt that he's running the machine.
[33:51.680 --> 33:55.420]  It sounds like a 1965 Ford F-150 trying to turn over.
[33:55.940 --> 33:56.780]  Here comes the ball.
[33:58.460 --> 33:59.500]  Two every time.
[34:00.800 --> 34:01.220]  21.
[34:02.280 --> 34:02.940]  Geoff, that's 21.
[34:03.540 --> 34:03.840]  You.
[34:04.640 --> 34:05.160]  You.
[34:06.140 --> 34:07.340]  That's a rough one.
[34:08.180 --> 34:09.100]  That's tough.
[34:11.200 --> 34:13.180]  So fast, we're gonna stop today.
[34:13.700 --> 34:15.300]  You're gonna have unagi, I guess.
[34:15.620 --> 34:16.500]  I don't like unagi.
[34:16.900 --> 34:18.260]  That's too bad.
[34:18.640 --> 34:19.400]  Udon noodles?
[34:20.120 --> 34:20.960]  Oh, that's a good one.
[34:21.260 --> 34:22.180]  Oh, I'm fucked.
[34:22.260 --> 34:22.720]  What can I do?
[34:22.760 --> 34:24.000]  There's not even any fruit I can eat.
[34:24.500 --> 34:25.580]  What am I gonna do?
[34:25.900 --> 34:27.040]  Let me pick another letter.
[34:27.160 --> 34:28.860]  Can I take a penalty and take another letter?
[34:29.160 --> 34:31.000]  No, you're stuck with you.
[34:31.980 --> 34:33.320]  Andrew, this is the worst.
[34:33.460 --> 34:34.480]  These are the worst pulls.
[34:35.020 --> 34:35.800]  I'm excited.
[34:36.060 --> 34:38.200]  You're gonna get a C or something super easy.
[34:38.720 --> 34:39.880]  I'm going for the third one.
[34:41.680 --> 34:50.860]  I guess I'm gonna go in the hole.
[35:01.020 --> 35:02.060]  Oh, it's fucked.
[35:02.100 --> 35:02.540]  It's fallen.
[35:02.740 --> 35:03.620]  It fell off the chute.
[35:04.360 --> 35:05.200]  What is it?
[35:06.960 --> 35:07.440]  16.
[35:07.720 --> 35:08.300]  I got 16.
[35:08.400 --> 35:08.800]  What's 16?
[35:09.540 --> 35:10.720]  Oh, it's so easy.
[35:11.260 --> 35:12.060]  Are you serious?
[35:12.400 --> 35:12.760]  Yeah.
[35:13.220 --> 35:14.380]  Oh, that's so easy.
[35:15.300 --> 35:16.200]  Oh, I love this.
[35:16.260 --> 35:17.220]  This is a great game.
[35:17.720 --> 35:18.160]  It rigged.
[35:18.360 --> 35:18.920]  It's rigged.
[35:20.040 --> 35:21.000]  That's fantastic.
[35:22.580 --> 35:23.060]  P.
[35:24.080 --> 35:26.160]  P, G, and U.
[35:27.380 --> 35:30.600]  Let's get some live reactions.
[35:30.940 --> 35:32.380]  Gavin, how you feeling about G?
[35:33.060 --> 35:34.820]  I don't feel very good about G.
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.360]  I'll trade you U for it.
[35:40.340 --> 35:43.460]  Geoff, how you feeling about the letter U?
[35:44.240 --> 35:46.260]  There's no food to start with U.
[35:46.360 --> 35:47.540]  I'm totally fucked.
[35:47.900 --> 35:48.500]  I'm ucked.
[35:49.340 --> 35:50.420]  What am I gonna eat?
[35:51.000 --> 35:52.200]  You're gonna die.
[35:53.080 --> 35:57.420]  Nick sent a handy list and one of the things is unpasteurized cheese.
[35:59.900 --> 36:01.980]  What can I do to get a different letter?
[36:02.840 --> 36:03.600]  I don't think you can.
[36:03.760 --> 36:05.060]  I think that's the joy of the games.
[36:05.060 --> 36:08.880]  Can I like do double the time for it to pick again or something?
[36:09.360 --> 36:12.500]  Remember when the end cap challenge was super easy?
[36:13.000 --> 36:13.880]  That was the problem with it.
[36:13.920 --> 36:14.540]  This is hard.
[36:15.860 --> 36:17.200]  Oh man, you got a U.
[36:17.320 --> 36:18.160]  That sucks.
[36:20.260 --> 36:22.200]  Upside down cake is the only thing I can eat.
[36:25.380 --> 36:27.120]  You could try unagi.
[36:27.540 --> 36:30.660]  I've never heard of this stuff.
[36:31.500 --> 36:33.020]  Oh, uni you could have.
[36:34.260 --> 36:35.000]  What is uni?
[36:35.580 --> 36:36.320]  The sea urchin.
[36:36.840 --> 36:38.040]  I don't like sea urchin.
[36:38.640 --> 36:40.160]  But you could get used to it.
[36:44.600 --> 36:47.720]  All right, I just I feel bad for Andrew.
[36:47.920 --> 36:51.680]  Papaya, passion fruit, plums, peaches, pineapple, pomegranate.
[36:52.240 --> 36:58.960]  Pizza, persnick, peas, peppers, potatoes, pumpkin, peanuts, pistachios, popcorn, pretzels,
[36:59.200 --> 37:00.680]  pancakes, pie.
[37:01.460 --> 37:04.400]  I can tell you one thing that starts with P that I will not be eating.
[37:04.900 --> 37:05.640]  I know that.
[37:05.760 --> 37:07.980]  You can remove one thing from the list immediately.
[37:08.480 --> 37:09.520]  Is that pastrami?
[37:10.040 --> 37:10.960]  It'd be some pencils.
[37:13.640 --> 37:14.680]  Fuck off.
[37:15.300 --> 37:16.860]  Andrew has to eat the P.
[37:20.880 --> 37:22.840]  I can't do this.
[37:23.320 --> 37:24.680]  I don't know what I'm going to do.
[37:25.740 --> 37:27.700]  Look, you might get some strikes, all right?
[37:28.220 --> 37:29.860]  But I think it's going to be attempted.
[37:31.700 --> 37:33.740]  How perfect is it that Andrew pulled P?
[37:34.040 --> 37:37.340]  You got G, you got Gavin, it's your name.
[37:37.920 --> 37:39.740]  I don't know what U has to do with Geoff.
[37:39.840 --> 37:40.840]  That's what I've been trying to figure out.
[37:40.860 --> 37:42.320]  What is your connection with U, Geoff?
[37:43.680 --> 37:45.320]  You have fucked yourself, Geoff.
[37:47.440 --> 37:49.640]  You shouldn't have had this idea, Geoff.
[37:49.760 --> 37:56.080]  This all came from Geoff saying that the end cap challenge was too easy,
[37:56.080 --> 38:01.040]  so he created a new thing and then he got fucked by his own idea.
[38:01.480 --> 38:03.260]  Perfect, perfect.
[38:03.400 --> 38:07.320]  Well, hey, Geoff, at least you don't have to worry about the Oreo conundrum.
[38:07.740 --> 38:11.480]  You're not even close to O or C or really anything.
[38:11.860 --> 38:13.880]  I would fucking kill...
[38:13.880 --> 38:15.720]  I would trade a PS5 for G.
[38:16.280 --> 38:19.220]  God, dude, I need grits for four days.
[38:19.300 --> 38:23.040]  Oh my god, I hate Udon.
[38:23.040 --> 38:24.120]  Oh, I'm so fucked.
[38:24.920 --> 38:26.000]  You don't like Udon?
[38:26.640 --> 38:28.380]  No, you know that.
[38:29.240 --> 38:30.560]  I don't know.
[38:34.020 --> 38:35.420]  Uh-oh, Geoff.
[38:35.460 --> 38:36.880]  What about Uncle Ben's?
[38:37.400 --> 38:39.320]  Uncle Ben's rice, there you go.
[38:41.400 --> 38:42.640]  I would veto that.
[38:43.040 --> 38:45.120]  Well, you would be one veto.
[38:48.040 --> 38:50.300]  Uh, I am completely...
[38:50.300 --> 38:54.060]  Andrew somehow fucking skates through life unscathed.
[38:54.220 --> 38:55.680]  I'm gonna need to see this footage.
[38:56.020 --> 38:56.420]  Yeah.
[38:56.720 --> 38:58.000]  And see how legit that draw was.
[38:58.620 --> 39:00.020]  I'm excited to send it.
[39:00.300 --> 39:02.160]  I recorded... I did it in three videos.
[39:02.680 --> 39:03.620]  I trusted it.
[39:03.680 --> 39:05.900]  I trusted it till I got a U and he got a P.
[39:06.280 --> 39:10.100]  I'm so glad that you could see the number before it falls out the chute because mine
[39:10.100 --> 39:14.640]  bounced out because of your two in the thing and it went to the floor and I had to go find it.
[39:16.320 --> 39:21.680]  Oh man, I genuinely... I don't know if I need to change my diet at all going into this challenge.
[39:22.040 --> 39:22.380]  No, I don't think so.
[39:22.580 --> 39:23.200]  Just eat normally.
[39:24.020 --> 39:26.520]  I think you're just gonna have a very standard four days.
[39:26.920 --> 39:28.300]  Oh, this is great.
[39:28.740 --> 39:31.160]  So when are we starting this? Monday?
[39:31.520 --> 39:31.960]  Monday.
[39:32.400 --> 39:32.600]  Monday.
[39:32.740 --> 39:35.340]  Oh man, I can't wait. Pizza Monday.
[39:36.420 --> 39:37.200]  Oh, it's gonna be great.
[39:37.420 --> 39:39.900]  Maybe I'll go pepperoni pizza, double up on the peas.
[39:41.060 --> 39:42.660]  Oh, this sucks.
[39:43.720 --> 39:44.560]  Oh, this is good.
[39:44.560 --> 39:46.700]  This really backfired on me.
[39:48.120 --> 39:50.220]  Grated cheese pizza. That's food, right?
[39:50.860 --> 39:51.100]  No.
[39:52.080 --> 39:55.060]  Ugly pie. What the fuck is ugly pie?
[39:57.240 --> 39:59.820]  What the fuck is ugly pie?
[40:00.360 --> 40:01.380]  Other than Thanksgiving.
[40:02.080 --> 40:04.040]  The story takes on a journey with Bear who...
[40:04.040 --> 40:05.260]  Oh, it's a fucking story.
[40:05.380 --> 40:07.060]  To make ugly pie at home, you're gonna need granny...
[40:07.060 --> 40:07.700]  Oh, here we go.
[40:08.080 --> 40:13.340]  Granny Smith apples, molasses, lemon juice, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, sugar, brown sugar,
[40:13.340 --> 40:15.940]  dried cranberries and walnuts. I can eat ugly pie.
[40:16.120 --> 40:17.200]  You can get diabetes.
[40:19.100 --> 40:23.180]  Unigusto. It's a Finnish dessert made from a cow's colostrum.
[40:31.420 --> 40:36.060]  I like that we already went through you last time is like one of the worst letters to get.
[40:36.820 --> 40:37.060]  Yeah.
[40:38.160 --> 40:40.540]  Oh, I can eat ugadi pachadi.
[40:40.540 --> 40:41.420]  Yeah.
[40:41.420 --> 40:45.180]  At least you're not trying to order xanthan gum or xylitol.
[40:45.260 --> 40:49.100]  Yeah, that's true. That's true. It's a special festive food that can blind...
[40:49.100 --> 40:50.120]  Oh, fuck.
[40:51.100 --> 40:52.480]  Everything I make is like...
[40:52.480 --> 40:55.940]  There's some things that look edible, but it's going to require me to cook for like seven hours.
[40:59.120 --> 41:00.000]  Unpasteurized cheese.
[41:00.140 --> 41:02.820]  There is no way.
[41:04.940 --> 41:06.120]  Err-err-da chee...
[41:06.760 --> 41:07.200]  Uh...
[41:07.200 --> 41:08.760]  Err-err...
[41:08.760 --> 41:09.460]  Yeah, Nick's right.
[41:09.460 --> 41:11.160]  You got the weekend to meal prep, dude.
[41:11.220 --> 41:12.840]  You can like lay out your whole week.
[41:12.980 --> 41:15.080]  You can get like so in control of your life.
[41:15.380 --> 41:17.460]  Oh, I can eat something called a Utah scone.
[41:17.920 --> 41:19.580]  Okay, Utah scones.
[41:19.920 --> 41:22.020]  They're light and fluffy, but dry and crumbly in texture.
[41:22.180 --> 41:23.640]  There are no rules when it comes to toppings.
[41:26.880 --> 41:30.220]  I think the only rule is you got to eat it with unpasteurized cheese.
[41:33.220 --> 41:34.000]  This is great.
[41:34.520 --> 41:34.880]  Motherfucker.
[41:35.460 --> 41:35.820]  Granola.
[41:36.060 --> 41:36.580]  I'm gonna be honest.
[41:36.580 --> 41:39.660]  When I bought the bingham machine, I was like, ah, that was kind of a waste.
[41:39.760 --> 41:40.460]  I regret doing it.
[41:40.560 --> 41:41.480]  Zero regrets now.
[41:41.680 --> 41:42.600]  That was fantastic.
[41:43.000 --> 41:43.760]  This has made my week.
[41:44.060 --> 41:48.000]  So like the main thing I can eat is is unagi, which is freshwater eel.
[41:48.320 --> 41:49.560]  I might as well...
[41:49.560 --> 41:49.980]  Fuck me.
[41:50.740 --> 41:51.200]  What's the pun?
[41:52.080 --> 41:53.180]  There is no punishment.
[41:53.280 --> 41:53.820]  We didn't determine.
[41:54.120 --> 41:56.220]  It's just, uh, yeah, you know, just sucks.
[41:56.660 --> 41:58.960]  This is a testing round of sorts, as you said.
[41:59.140 --> 42:03.020]  Yeah, it's just, uh, wanting to win for the love of the game.
[42:03.760 --> 42:04.040]  Okay.
[42:04.580 --> 42:05.640]  Yeah, for the love of the game.
[42:05.640 --> 42:07.080]  Oh, I can eat urchins.
[42:07.300 --> 42:08.020]  That's great.
[42:09.680 --> 42:13.200]  If you view it this way, if we do another round of this,
[42:13.260 --> 42:17.980]  one of the worst letters out of the rotation theoretically could only get easier for you.
[42:18.320 --> 42:18.960]  Oh, here we go.
[42:19.020 --> 42:19.920]  I can eat uluku.
[42:20.580 --> 42:22.280]  It's second only to the potato.
[42:22.680 --> 42:27.020]  One of the most widely grown root vegetable crops in the Andean regions of South America.
[42:27.120 --> 42:28.820]  So it's readily available for me here.
[42:28.940 --> 42:31.140]  It is brightly colored with waxy skin.
[42:31.220 --> 42:32.540]  It can be yellow, pink or purple in hue.
[42:32.740 --> 42:33.100]  Cool.
[42:36.160 --> 42:37.460]  Oh, it's big in Bolivia.
[42:38.140 --> 42:42.320]  It's a big, big and it's a big traditional food during Catholic Holy Week in Bolivia.
[42:42.520 --> 42:44.200]  Awesome. I'm sure that'll be easy to find.
[42:45.520 --> 42:47.360]  You can eat ube.
[42:47.620 --> 42:48.800]  It's like that purple yam.
[42:49.260 --> 42:50.220]  Oh, that sounds good.
[42:50.660 --> 42:51.400]  Yeah, it sounds good, right?
[42:52.100 --> 42:52.500]  Purple.
[42:52.660 --> 42:53.440]  Yams are delicious.
[42:53.780 --> 42:54.700]  Yeah, purple's fun.
[42:55.300 --> 42:56.240]  That's fun for you.
[42:56.480 --> 42:56.940]  That's fun.
[42:57.120 --> 42:58.300]  Now this, now this I could eat.
[42:58.680 --> 42:59.340]  Ugly fruit.
[42:59.780 --> 43:03.440]  Ugly fruit or unique fruit, commonly known as Jamaican tangelo,
[43:03.440 --> 43:08.680]  is a citrus fruit that arose through natural hybridization of the tangerine with a grapefruit.
[43:08.880 --> 43:10.280]  I'm all about that.
[43:10.420 --> 43:12.580]  Can I get ugly fruit in Texas?
[43:12.960 --> 43:15.940]  Can you can you make an ugly pie out of ugly fruit?
[43:16.040 --> 43:18.540]  I was about to say, is there no ugly fruit and ugly pie?
[43:19.120 --> 43:19.360]  Umbrella.
[43:19.480 --> 43:21.260]  If so, that feels like a tremendous waste.
[43:21.560 --> 43:22.440]  I agree with Andrew.
[43:24.140 --> 43:26.200]  Gavin, do you have any suggestions for Geoff?
[43:28.840 --> 43:29.360]  No.
[43:29.820 --> 43:31.980]  Just laughter is the only response needed.
[43:32.900 --> 43:35.220]  I was thinking about, jeez, I'm just...
[43:35.220 --> 43:36.400]  Geoff's in his own world of hate.
[43:36.640 --> 43:41.260]  Oh man, I feel like Nick brought up that you'd probably get an X if we did this again.
[43:41.380 --> 43:44.420]  I feel like we need to do this again just to see.
[43:44.780 --> 43:48.680]  Andrew, I hope you are able to muddle through four days of pizza.
[43:48.980 --> 43:50.320]  That's gonna be...
[43:50.320 --> 43:56.300]  Yeah, I might have to swap it out with a pineapple, get some pineapple pieces, uh, potatoes.
[43:57.120 --> 43:58.020]  It's gonna be a real struggle.
[43:58.760 --> 44:00.220]  You've got such an abundance of choice.
[44:00.220 --> 44:04.160]  Your choices will have pea... you could put peas on your peas.
[44:05.120 --> 44:07.640]  You could have a pizza with all pea ingredients.
[44:08.380 --> 44:11.100]  Yeah, that's what I said, a nice pepperoni pizza, double up.
[44:11.900 --> 44:13.300]  Look, that's how easy you've got it.
[44:13.780 --> 44:17.240]  A pistachio maybe, like I said, one of the top tier nuts from before.
[44:17.580 --> 44:19.200]  I got a lot of choices I could go with.
[44:19.380 --> 44:22.560]  You could also eat peanuts, the lowest tier of nuts.
[44:22.960 --> 44:24.100]  The Coke of nuts, yeah.
[44:24.660 --> 44:25.580]  You could eat peas.
[44:26.660 --> 44:29.280]  I could eat peas. I feel like I have to.
[44:29.280 --> 44:31.020]  You can eat pretzels.
[44:31.480 --> 44:33.220]  Geoff, are there any nuts that you can eat?
[44:33.240 --> 44:33.780]  You can eat Pringles.
[44:35.940 --> 44:38.140]  Nuts that start with U, that's a great question.
[44:40.060 --> 44:40.620]  Ugly nut.
[44:43.680 --> 44:45.100]  I'm fucked. I'm ucked.
[44:46.800 --> 44:48.060]  No, it doesn't look like it.
[44:49.520 --> 44:50.380]  So here's the thing.
[44:50.900 --> 44:55.520]  I have, I think, without a doubt, gotten the easiest letter to work with.
[44:55.840 --> 44:58.340]  Like, undeniably, I think we would all agree, pea is the easiest.
[44:58.340 --> 45:03.320]  The issue is, as we've established, we got the salad cream veins over here.
[45:03.500 --> 45:07.240]  I am probably the least qualified, so I'm terrified that I somehow,
[45:07.840 --> 45:10.300]  I'm going to screw this up with the easiest position.
[45:10.500 --> 45:11.880]  Which feels very possible.
[45:11.920 --> 45:15.800]  Yeah, if you salad cream the pea, that would be the biggest waste.
[45:15.940 --> 45:16.400]  It would be.
[45:16.700 --> 45:17.560]  There'd be no hope for me.
[45:17.920 --> 45:21.640]  Imagine how mad Geoff will be if you salad cream having pea,
[45:21.760 --> 45:23.280]  and he has been dealing with you all week.
[45:23.560 --> 45:25.660]  That's not, that's a, that's a Greg right there.
[45:25.700 --> 45:26.500]  That's not a salad cream.
[45:26.720 --> 45:27.360]  It's way worse than that.
[45:27.360 --> 45:28.500]  That's a Greg.
[45:29.700 --> 45:33.380]  Yeah, I think I would get out, use my get out of Greg free card on this.
[45:33.440 --> 45:37.560]  I think I'm, I think I'm just going to have to walk around the grocery store
[45:37.560 --> 45:39.900]  and look for shit that says, that starts with you.
[45:41.340 --> 45:46.640]  Oh, I hate, I hate that I, I hate that I, I hate that I said we should do this.
[45:47.440 --> 45:49.400]  I love it. I think it's the best thing we've ever done.
[45:49.680 --> 45:49.920]  Potentially.
[45:50.080 --> 45:51.320]  Wait, do we have to start this week?
[45:52.000 --> 45:52.400]  Uh, Monday.
[45:52.880 --> 45:53.560]  Yeah, we're starting Monday.
[45:53.800 --> 45:54.160]  This upcoming Monday.
[45:54.420 --> 45:56.100]  But this one won't come out for...
[45:56.100 --> 45:57.940]  This will come out two weeks from now.
[45:58.060 --> 46:02.100]  This one will come out in two weeks and then the actual food one where we digest it.
[46:02.100 --> 46:03.900]  So when we talk about it, since you're busy all...
[46:03.900 --> 46:05.180]  Wait, you're shooting all next week?
[46:05.360 --> 46:05.620]  Yeah.
[46:05.980 --> 46:08.480]  That monkey lunch, uh, still, that's still okay?
[46:08.640 --> 46:10.080]  We have to move the monkey lunch?
[46:10.500 --> 46:14.220]  Oh, no, come on.
[46:14.840 --> 46:15.280]  No.
[46:15.840 --> 46:19.120]  Well, we could, why don't we do monkey breakfast?
[46:19.840 --> 46:20.520]  You gotta be kidding me.
[46:20.520 --> 46:22.780]  No, I'm not doing, we're, we're, it's moving.
[46:22.880 --> 46:24.520]  We're moving monkey lunch another week.
[46:24.520 --> 46:27.220]  We'll do monkey lunch and we'll do two more of these.
[46:27.320 --> 46:29.480]  We'll do what was supposed to be this week.
[46:29.980 --> 46:30.540]  What the fuck?
[46:30.540 --> 46:31.420]  I can probably still make it happen.
[46:31.740 --> 46:32.420]  No, you don't have to.
[46:32.660 --> 46:34.240]  I don't want, you don't have to force...
[46:34.240 --> 46:35.980]  Don't listen to Andrew, you do have to.
[46:37.220 --> 46:40.060]  He just wants more time to go through his fucking slideshow.
[46:40.160 --> 46:40.720]  I'm almost done.
[46:40.820 --> 46:42.180]  How about, how about monkey evening then?
[46:42.500 --> 46:43.340]  I'd do a monkey evening.
[46:43.600 --> 46:44.580]  It doesn't matter to me.
[46:44.880 --> 46:46.320]  I'm, I'm happy.
[46:46.440 --> 46:47.640]  I just want to film the fucking thing.
[46:49.940 --> 46:51.440]  Are we really moving it?
[46:51.560 --> 46:53.940]  Are we really talking about moving fucking monkey lunch?
[46:54.800 --> 46:55.860]  That's what Gavin's saying.
[46:56.160 --> 46:58.000]  I need that as a soundbite.
[47:03.820 --> 47:05.560]  Geoff, what are you going to eat for monkey lunch?
[47:05.660 --> 47:07.080]  Because at that point you could eat anything.
[47:08.160 --> 47:09.660]  Uh, I don't know, man.
[47:09.940 --> 47:12.440]  I'll probably eat pizza and grits.
[47:13.920 --> 47:14.860]  Oh, so will I.
[47:15.120 --> 47:17.520]  Well, not the grits, but half of that.
[47:18.240 --> 47:19.140]  That'll be me all week.
[47:19.180 --> 47:20.860]  I'll be sick of pizza by the time you get there.
[47:20.860 --> 47:28.040]  So we got to start this Monday because we need to discuss it in the next recording,
[47:28.180 --> 47:28.900]  which is next Thursday.
[47:29.040 --> 47:30.480]  Are you going to make a face next Thursday?
[47:30.580 --> 47:31.020]  Is that okay?
[47:32.300 --> 47:33.260]  I'm assuming no.
[47:34.520 --> 47:36.440]  So why did we set all this up?
[47:36.680 --> 47:39.800]  Well, because he didn't, he didn't reveal that until after we did it, but it's fine.
[47:39.820 --> 47:42.820]  Cause the next recording we'll do, we'll have the whole thing finished.
[47:43.360 --> 47:44.340]  It'll be all done.
[47:44.540 --> 47:45.900]  We can talk about our experience.
[47:46.520 --> 47:48.480]  I think it's, I can, I can make these recordings.
[47:49.000 --> 47:49.480]  I'll be there.
[47:50.280 --> 47:50.640]  Okay.
[47:52.560 --> 47:52.920]  Okay.
[47:53.300 --> 47:56.160]  There's something so not assuring about your assurances.
[47:56.940 --> 48:00.640]  I'm so excited for Geoff to eat you foods for four days.
[48:00.860 --> 48:04.140]  And then we got, and then Gavin goes, well, boys, guess what?
[48:08.840 --> 48:09.360]  That's great.
[48:09.500 --> 48:10.620]  This is, I feel all settled.
[48:10.840 --> 48:12.300]  We got the system laid out.
[48:12.380 --> 48:13.120]  Show what we eat.
[48:13.180 --> 48:15.260]  Oh, I can't wait to just be sending Geoff pizza photos.
[48:15.540 --> 48:17.640]  But what, but what I was going to say was that we could potentially do this on the,
[48:17.640 --> 48:20.720]  on like, I will be out of town that week.
[48:21.180 --> 48:22.720]  Is it was something worth it?
[48:24.220 --> 48:24.620]  Yeah.
[48:25.720 --> 48:30.860]  But, uh, but I also, I also informed my producer about that like months ago when it's been on my
[48:30.860 --> 48:33.720]  calendar and it's true.
[48:33.960 --> 48:35.440]  That's why we're doing this week.
[48:35.620 --> 48:37.220]  I've known about, I've known about that.
[48:37.620 --> 48:37.760]  Yeah.
[48:37.780 --> 48:40.340]  That must be awfully convenient knowing exactly when you can do something.
[48:40.720 --> 48:42.040]  Well, I plan stuff ahead, you know?
[48:42.220 --> 48:42.460]  Yeah.
[48:42.460 --> 48:44.200]  I'm sort of relying on the schedules of others.
[48:44.540 --> 48:46.160]  Gavin, the man just drew a you.
[48:46.160 --> 48:48.000]  He, he just drew a you.
[48:48.180 --> 48:51.080]  Let's just, we'll just let him, it doesn't matter who's right.
[48:51.100 --> 48:51.820]  He drew a you.
[48:52.020 --> 48:52.700]  Let him have it.
[48:53.320 --> 48:55.020]  We're going to let him have it in this moment.
[48:55.980 --> 48:56.220]  All right.
[48:56.340 --> 48:57.380]  It's a tough day for him.
[48:57.620 --> 48:59.560]  I will say, are we good?
[48:59.640 --> 49:01.260]  We all happy with how this is scheduled?
[49:01.880 --> 49:03.800]  We're fine with it before I move on?
[49:03.820 --> 49:04.060]  Yeah.
[49:04.200 --> 49:06.740]  So Monday, so three days from now, we're starting.
[49:07.060 --> 49:07.300]  Great.
[49:07.720 --> 49:08.020]  Okay.
[49:08.120 --> 49:12.500]  I want to, I want to talk about a different bet that we've discussed a little bit.
[49:12.960 --> 49:15.060]  The gamer score bet between Gavin and I.
[49:15.060 --> 49:18.620]  I think, and I don't know, we haven't talked about this because you've been away
[49:18.620 --> 49:20.380]  and I didn't want to bother you on your vacation.
[49:20.960 --> 49:25.720]  Did you see that Goldeneye is coming out soon to the console?
[49:26.120 --> 49:26.440]  I did.
[49:26.740 --> 49:30.260]  And I'm assuming Goldeneye was a big childhood game for you.
[49:30.360 --> 49:31.420]  So when you played it, you installed it.
[49:32.020 --> 49:33.100]  It was my childhood.
[49:33.400 --> 49:34.300]  It was your childhood.
[49:34.720 --> 49:39.340]  I think instead of the gamer score bet, because after we recorded that,
[49:39.360 --> 49:40.780]  I had a bunch of people just send me like,
[49:40.860 --> 49:44.020]  here's a $5 game that you could get a thousand points in three minutes.
[49:44.020 --> 49:46.920]  I don't think the content that'd be made from that would be that interesting.
[49:47.140 --> 49:48.200]  I don't know how I'd make it.
[49:48.480 --> 49:51.420]  Like that's, I think the best part of all the game bets we've had
[49:51.420 --> 49:53.740]  is there's been a content piece attached to it.
[49:54.120 --> 49:56.600]  This would just, the gamer score thing would be essentially
[49:56.600 --> 49:59.020]  just me throwing money at a problem to win it.
[49:59.340 --> 50:01.420]  I don't think that's funny or all that interesting.
[50:01.980 --> 50:04.340]  Why don't we do something in Goldeneye when that comes out?
[50:04.840 --> 50:05.620]  It could be times.
[50:05.800 --> 50:07.140]  They've got timed level things.
[50:07.260 --> 50:08.880]  Like, I just think there's something there.
[50:09.520 --> 50:10.440]  We're both Bond guys.
[50:11.020 --> 50:13.380]  Try and get like a 20 second frigate on 00.
[50:13.380 --> 50:17.320]  Yeah, like do exactly what we did with the Halo and the times.
[50:17.500 --> 50:20.520]  If we want to go that way and do it on a Bond level instead for Goldeneye,
[50:20.620 --> 50:21.920]  since that's right around the corner.
[50:22.100 --> 50:22.480]  It seems.
[50:22.840 --> 50:24.060]  Why am I suddenly playing?
[50:24.300 --> 50:25.480]  I'm just, I'm suggesting a bet.
[50:25.520 --> 50:26.340]  You don't have to play.
[50:26.640 --> 50:27.720]  If you want, we could set times.
[50:27.880 --> 50:29.880]  I just haven't played the game in 20 years.
[50:29.900 --> 50:30.760]  So I don't know.
[50:30.920 --> 50:33.860]  I can't be like, I'm going to get 45 seconds on this level.
[50:33.920 --> 50:35.000]  I don't know the level names.
[50:35.160 --> 50:36.140]  I haven't played in a while.
[50:36.460 --> 50:39.620]  I just thought it'd be fun because we've talked about wanting to do
[50:40.060 --> 50:42.300]  the Halo thing again in some form.
[50:42.300 --> 50:46.180]  And I feel like Goldeneye could work because they both, I feel like would be equal at it.
[50:46.320 --> 50:48.780]  I'd let you set the terms like in the Halo thing.
[50:49.220 --> 50:50.560]  I'm just throwing it out there as a suggestion.
[50:50.720 --> 50:52.860]  I think that'd be a better idea than the gamerscore bet.
[50:53.420 --> 50:54.980]  Take less time out of your life.
[50:55.240 --> 50:55.880]  Not necessarily.
[50:56.260 --> 51:00.620]  Honestly, I think if you had to get to a million gamerscore in any short amount of time,
[51:01.080 --> 51:01.920]  it would ruin your life.
[51:02.420 --> 51:05.100]  Well, we ended up the last time we said it was half a mil.
[51:05.600 --> 51:05.780]  Yeah.
[51:05.840 --> 51:10.680]  And I think that would be incredibly doable based off of the information people have sent me.
[51:10.680 --> 51:16.240]  I do think it is, to Andrew's point, I do think it is throwing money at a problem to solve it.
[51:16.340 --> 51:17.060]  Yeah, it's not.
[51:17.080 --> 51:17.600]  At some point.
[51:18.080 --> 51:20.080]  I think funny or interesting about that.
[51:20.400 --> 51:21.760]  I like the Goldeneye angle.
[51:21.960 --> 51:24.520]  I feel like you guys should both wear tuxedos the whole time you're playing.
[51:25.840 --> 51:28.740]  Not the tuxedo, obviously, but tuxedos.
[51:29.040 --> 51:30.660]  Or dress up as your dress.
[51:30.760 --> 51:34.940]  One of you has to dress up as Oddjob or like, I don't know, dress up as your favorite Bond character.
[51:35.740 --> 51:37.180]  Yeah, I think that's funny.
[51:37.540 --> 51:39.020]  I don't think that needs to be a requirement.
[51:39.020 --> 51:40.660]  I like the idea, though.
[51:41.120 --> 51:42.740]  I just want to play Goldeneye.
[51:43.540 --> 51:44.320]  It would be funny.
[51:44.520 --> 51:44.780]  I agree.
[51:44.900 --> 51:45.320]  All right.
[51:45.380 --> 51:46.080]  We'll do something with Goldeneye.
[51:46.500 --> 51:47.640]  Yeah, I think that'd be fun.
[51:48.040 --> 51:49.540]  Hey, you guys are Halo guys.
[51:49.860 --> 51:55.800]  Can you explain to me, is Splitscreen Co-op never coming out for Halo 5?
[51:55.980 --> 51:56.960]  Is that what's, or Halo Infinite?
[51:57.080 --> 51:57.920]  Is that what's going on here?
[51:58.160 --> 52:00.760]  Yeah, it sounds like that that will never happen.
[52:01.320 --> 52:03.840]  So I held off on playing Halo for over a year.
[52:03.840 --> 52:04.680]  But that will be Co-op.
[52:05.620 --> 52:07.600]  They will have online Co-op.
[52:07.600 --> 52:09.220]  I don't know if you're...
[52:09.220 --> 52:11.200]  And I believe it's cross-play as well.
[52:11.320 --> 52:13.180]  So as long as you have a computer and a console.
[52:13.180 --> 52:16.560]  No, we're an Xbox and one PS5 family.
[52:18.640 --> 52:20.260]  So I could still play with Millie.
[52:20.340 --> 52:21.560]  We would just have to play on different Xboxes.
[52:21.560 --> 52:21.720]  Absolutely.
[52:21.940 --> 52:23.280]  Yeah, she could just be in her room.
[52:23.540 --> 52:25.480]  And is that already out or is that not?
[52:25.480 --> 52:28.980]  No, that is hoping, I think, hopeful to be out by the end of the year.
[52:29.640 --> 52:30.000]  Oh, of course.
[52:31.060 --> 52:35.060]  It's Halo Infinite is a mess as far as the content release structure goes.
[52:35.060 --> 52:38.200]  It's probably one of my most played Halo games, though.
[52:38.340 --> 52:39.220]  I still really like it.
[52:39.480 --> 52:41.240]  Yeah, it's like there's...
[52:41.240 --> 52:45.260]  It's the most frustrating part of it is that at its core, it's so good.
[52:45.340 --> 52:48.780]  And the Forge stuff that is coming out for it looks incredible.
[52:49.160 --> 52:52.800]  The things that people are doing and just the beta for it is ridiculous.
[52:53.220 --> 52:55.400]  Just want to play the campaign with my daughter.
[52:56.200 --> 52:57.000]  It's a great campaign.
[52:57.160 --> 52:58.520]  So excited for it.
[52:58.820 --> 53:01.760]  I think one of the hardest things to nail in Halo is like, does it feel like Halo?
[53:02.680 --> 53:04.700]  And they got the feel right, which is good.
[53:05.180 --> 53:07.000]  That's they just don't have anything else.
[53:08.380 --> 53:11.920]  It's yeah, I think the single player experience, though, you'll have a great time.
[53:12.140 --> 53:14.620]  It's really the multiplayer that is barren.
[53:15.080 --> 53:15.200]  Yeah.
[53:15.420 --> 53:18.280]  OK, and I enjoyed the multiplayer as little as I played.
[53:18.520 --> 53:19.860]  But that's not like Halo to me.
[53:20.520 --> 53:22.320]  It is like it's not that it's not good.
[53:22.420 --> 53:24.780]  It's that nothing has changed since you've played.
[53:25.000 --> 53:25.300]  Really?
[53:25.740 --> 53:28.240]  Like it's essentially the same game with no content updates.
[53:28.660 --> 53:30.040]  That's just it's a little tired.
[53:30.160 --> 53:30.440]  Gotcha.
[53:30.680 --> 53:31.040]  That's good.
[53:32.760 --> 53:36.160]  Oh, well, what a good day for you.
[53:36.360 --> 53:38.400]  OK, what a good day for some of us.
[53:38.500 --> 53:39.420]  Are you all right, man?
[53:39.920 --> 53:42.740]  Man, I was like just about any letter would have been fine.
[53:42.760 --> 53:45.860]  But you like I could have made a lot of stuff work.
[53:46.620 --> 53:47.960]  I mean, I'm going to make you work.
[53:48.000 --> 53:48.700]  I'm going to make it work.
[53:48.840 --> 53:49.480]  I'll make it work.
[53:49.740 --> 53:53.300]  I wonder if we should try and go out for dinner one night and we'll order our respective.
[53:53.700 --> 53:54.540]  I love that.
[53:54.600 --> 53:55.020]  Yeah, yeah.
[53:55.080 --> 53:55.640]  That's a great idea.
[53:55.900 --> 53:56.780]  What do you think I'm going to order?
[53:56.900 --> 53:57.980]  I'm going to order ugly fruit.
[53:58.400 --> 53:58.800]  Udon.
[54:00.880 --> 54:02.040]  The Udon Unagi.
[54:02.640 --> 54:08.040]  I feel like I read a story recently where like the Rock brings food to restaurants for them to make.
[54:08.120 --> 54:09.720]  Like he brings his own food for them to cook.
[54:09.800 --> 54:10.380]  That could be you.
[54:10.620 --> 54:12.280]  You could just bring your own U products.
[54:12.780 --> 54:12.980]  Yeah.
[54:13.280 --> 54:16.060]  Here's my Ukrainian dinner rolls.
[54:16.200 --> 54:16.900]  Please heat them up.
[54:19.800 --> 54:21.460]  You could have a rough few days.
[54:21.480 --> 54:22.540]  I feel bad for you.
[54:22.560 --> 54:22.680]  What?
[54:22.900 --> 54:23.540]  How about this?
[54:24.400 --> 54:26.960]  There's a sushi restaurant in Austin called Uchi.
[54:27.520 --> 54:29.220]  Can I eat anything in that restaurant?
[54:29.580 --> 54:29.640]  No.
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.260]  That does not fly.
[54:32.840 --> 54:33.260]  That's fair.
[54:33.980 --> 54:37.860]  I don't expect you to have seen them because you've been away, Gavin.
[54:37.960 --> 54:39.720]  Have you watched any of Survive Block Island?
[54:39.820 --> 54:41.600]  At this point, three episodes have released.
[54:41.760 --> 54:42.160]  Or I guess two.
[54:42.240 --> 54:43.420]  The third one came out this morning.
[54:43.920 --> 54:44.680]  You watched any of that?
[54:45.120 --> 54:45.900]  I watched the first two.
[54:45.980 --> 54:46.120]  Yeah.
[54:46.520 --> 54:48.260]  I really enjoyed it.
[54:48.320 --> 54:51.800]  And I think it's interesting to see what was edited out of those episodes.
[54:52.140 --> 54:54.240]  Pretty much anything we did because we're never...
[54:54.240 --> 54:54.860]  That's true.
[54:55.280 --> 54:55.740]  I don't know.
[54:55.740 --> 54:56.740]  The shopping vlog.
[54:57.320 --> 55:00.200]  So far, yeah, we've had a lack of coverage.
[55:00.420 --> 55:01.960]  But you know what made me really happy?
[55:02.560 --> 55:04.700]  I don't know if it's in episode three.
[55:04.940 --> 55:07.820]  If it is, people have seen it by now.
[55:08.220 --> 55:14.600]  But you and I talked about that we built to a cloud in the sky and that it was meaningless.
[55:14.960 --> 55:15.460]  Like, there was nothing.
[55:15.520 --> 55:16.280]  It was like a bug.
[55:16.360 --> 55:17.520]  We thought there'd be something up there.
[55:17.600 --> 55:19.200]  We spent all this effort getting to it.
[55:19.820 --> 55:21.860]  Yeah, it was like a copy and paste error or something.
[55:21.940 --> 55:22.160]  Yeah.
[55:22.260 --> 55:25.720]  I don't know if that scene is in the show of us doing that.
[55:25.720 --> 55:30.920]  But in like the first or second episode, they do a cool transition to the lava base.
[55:31.280 --> 55:33.040]  And you can see our blocks in the sky.
[55:33.180 --> 55:34.320]  And it just made me so happy.
[55:34.400 --> 55:36.440]  There's like a half second of our bullshit.
[55:36.720 --> 55:38.260]  Just like a line that goes nowhere.
[55:38.400 --> 55:38.580]  Yeah.
[55:39.040 --> 55:39.960]  It's brought me a lot of joy.
[55:40.240 --> 55:42.540]  I don't know if you don't really see us build anything in the base either,
[55:42.620 --> 55:45.220]  but there's a sign by the hot tub that I made.
[55:45.300 --> 55:46.280]  It just says wet box.
[55:46.540 --> 55:47.060]  And that made it.
[55:49.200 --> 55:53.880]  So I don't remember if it made the edit or not.
[55:54.680 --> 55:56.460]  But... so don't quote me on this.
[55:56.900 --> 56:01.540]  But if it didn't, there was discussion because you guys did it.
[56:01.720 --> 56:04.020]  We... it was actually inconvenient.
[56:04.020 --> 56:05.260]  You guys took forever to do it.
[56:05.300 --> 56:06.880]  And we... it was just so funny.
[56:06.960 --> 56:07.920]  We let you guys go.
[56:08.360 --> 56:11.000]  And it actually pushed production back a little bit while you guys climbed.
[56:11.100 --> 56:11.420]  Oh no.
[56:11.620 --> 56:12.660]  Sorry to inconvenience you.
[56:12.800 --> 56:12.900]  Sorry.
[56:13.040 --> 56:13.500]  No, no, that's fine.
[56:13.720 --> 56:14.920]  It's fine. It's okay. I don't care.
[56:16.540 --> 56:21.060]  But there was a lot of discussion that day about clipping that and making it like
[56:21.060 --> 56:21.880]  shoulder content.
[56:21.880 --> 56:26.700]  Like just taking that little non sequitur out and then just making it its own piece of content.
[56:26.880 --> 56:32.240]  So I think if it didn't make the episode, it will make it out in some form.
[56:32.840 --> 56:33.240]  Sweet.
[56:33.900 --> 56:34.300]  Awesome.
[56:34.380 --> 56:34.700]  I believe.
[56:35.300 --> 56:37.400]  Because it was very, very, very funny.
[56:37.480 --> 56:38.300]  I watched you guys forever.
[56:38.420 --> 56:39.040]  It was very funny.
[56:40.900 --> 56:41.920]  I... yeah, it's fun.
[56:42.480 --> 56:43.240]  We already talked.
[56:43.280 --> 56:43.580]  Never mind.
[56:43.960 --> 56:44.240]  Never mind.
[56:44.300 --> 56:47.140]  I was just going to say in the first episode, it was interesting to see that like it was
[56:47.140 --> 56:47.640]  edited out.
[56:47.700 --> 56:48.680]  Me failing to get...
[56:48.680 --> 56:53.100]  I was so goddamn mad to see in the first episode that that totem was just in the grass.
[56:54.380 --> 56:56.980]  I never thought... I assumed it would be in a chest somewhere.
[56:57.080 --> 56:58.740]  I must have passed it so many times.
[56:58.840 --> 56:59.600]  They edited it out.
[56:59.660 --> 57:00.820]  I went to that island it was on.
[57:00.880 --> 57:02.880]  I think Blaine did too, based on the episode.
[57:03.000 --> 57:04.260]  I don't know how he didn't get it either.
[57:05.380 --> 57:06.020]  Pretty funny.
[57:06.360 --> 57:06.720]  That's good.
[57:06.800 --> 57:07.180]  I'm excited.
[57:07.280 --> 57:07.880]  You excited, Geoff?
[57:07.900 --> 57:08.680]  You sound enthused.
[57:08.680 --> 57:09.640]  Yeah, I'm going to go...
[57:10.360 --> 57:13.580]  I'm going to go to the grocery store now and I'm going to start prepping.
[57:14.160 --> 57:15.640]  We should have done the draw at the end.
[57:15.940 --> 57:16.840]  We should have.
[57:16.940 --> 57:17.420]  Yeah, really.
[57:18.200 --> 57:21.080]  I mean, who could have foreseen this?
[57:21.080 --> 57:21.500]  That's fair.
[57:21.800 --> 57:24.940]  I figured he was going to get an H and eat hamburgers.
[57:25.000 --> 57:25.620]  You know what I mean?
[57:25.760 --> 57:27.960]  And then now... boy.
[57:29.280 --> 57:31.060]  Maybe I'll dabble some pastrami.
[57:31.140 --> 57:32.340]  I got that on the menu as well.
[57:32.400 --> 57:33.600]  Maybe I could see where I line up.
[57:33.680 --> 57:35.640]  Listen, that's totally... I recommend that.
[57:35.720 --> 57:36.780]  I think pastrami is lovely.
[57:37.420 --> 57:40.420]  Not for me, but I want everybody else to...
[57:40.420 --> 57:43.600]  I want pastrami to enjoy other people and other people to enjoy pastrami.
[57:44.000 --> 57:45.700]  I want nothing but the best for pastrami.
[57:45.700 --> 57:50.860]  And if you guys develop some sort of a relationship, I'll support it.
[57:51.120 --> 57:51.520]  Fantastic.
[57:51.940 --> 57:52.420]  This is fun.
[57:52.880 --> 57:55.140]  I can't wait to catch up with you guys next week or two weeks.
[57:55.200 --> 57:56.760]  Whenever this... whenever it happens.
[57:57.060 --> 57:57.420]  Depending on...
[57:57.420 --> 57:58.040]  All right.
[57:58.100 --> 57:58.340]  All right.
[57:58.360 --> 58:02.120]  Don't forget Monday morning from when you wake up on Monday,
[58:02.380 --> 58:05.140]  whenever that is, until we record on Thursday.
[58:05.840 --> 58:07.560]  Andrew, you're only eating P.
[58:07.960 --> 58:10.680]  And Gavin, you're only eating G.
[58:10.940 --> 58:12.920]  And Geoff, you're only eating U.
[58:13.340 --> 58:15.520]  I'm flying someone in for like a collaboration.
[58:15.520 --> 58:19.620]  And I'm going to have to explain to them why I'm eating when we have lunch.
[58:20.100 --> 58:20.660]  Yes, you are.
[58:21.600 --> 58:22.420]  Oh, dude.
[58:22.480 --> 58:24.240]  Just that Nick asked, does this impact drinks?
[58:24.320 --> 58:24.760]  No, it doesn't.
[58:24.900 --> 58:25.340]  Purely food.
[58:25.420 --> 58:25.820]  No, it doesn't.
[58:25.840 --> 58:26.040]  Just food.
[58:26.500 --> 58:26.900]  Just food.
[58:27.160 --> 58:27.380]  Sweet.
[58:27.900 --> 58:29.000]  Well, this is fun.
[58:29.560 --> 58:30.300]  Good luck, everyone.
[58:30.580 --> 58:31.100]  Good luck.
[58:32.520 --> 58:33.380]  Oh, my God.
[58:34.420 --> 58:35.560]  I love you guys.
[58:36.420 --> 58:38.820]  And I also hate you a little bit.
[58:38.880 --> 58:39.820]  And I'm going to hate...
[58:39.820 --> 58:44.100]  I guarantee you by Wednesday evening, I'm going to fucking despise you.
[58:46.240 --> 58:46.600]  Well...
[58:46.600 --> 58:48.480]  So I apologize for any mean texts I send.
[58:49.140 --> 58:49.600]  No, it's fine.
[58:50.300 --> 58:53.220]  In reality, it's you being mad at yourself because this is your idea.
[58:53.600 --> 58:54.420]  And this is all you.
[58:54.480 --> 58:55.440]  You did all of this.
[58:55.540 --> 58:55.920]  This is you.
[58:56.360 --> 58:57.960]  Yes, but I'm going to externalize that.
[58:58.380 --> 58:58.940]  Yeah, that's fine.
[58:59.200 --> 58:59.700]  I understand.
[58:59.960 --> 59:02.900]  I'm saying I won't take it personally because I know really it's just you being mad at yourself.
[59:03.040 --> 59:05.860]  It'll be pure hypocrisy, but it is what it is.
[59:09.260 --> 59:09.880]  All right.
[59:09.920 --> 59:13.260]  Well, thank you for listening to another episode of the F*** Face podcast.
[59:13.260 --> 59:15.700]  I believe this was the one, two, three version.
[59:16.500 --> 59:18.360]  And so four, five, six, we're going to go away.
[59:19.200 --> 59:19.640]  Hey, guys.
[59:19.760 --> 59:22.920]  Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[59:23.260 --> 59:24.440]  Gavin killed Coolio.
[59:24.820 --> 59:26.280]  Should we still send out socks?
[59:26.640 --> 59:28.020]  Is piss thicker than blood?
[59:28.460 --> 59:30.520]  How did everyone do on the alphabet challenge?
[59:30.920 --> 59:32.300]  Gavin's Godzilla roll.
[59:32.700 --> 59:34.320]  Three days to upside down.
[59:34.760 --> 59:37.320]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[59:37.820 --> 59:40.640]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
