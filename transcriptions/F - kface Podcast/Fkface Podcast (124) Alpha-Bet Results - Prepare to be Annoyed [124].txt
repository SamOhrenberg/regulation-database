[00:15.030 --> 00:19.350]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face podcast.
[00:19.750 --> 00:30.730]  I believe this is number 124 in a series of little chat sessions that we have.
[00:30.970 --> 00:36.450]  My name is Geoff Ramsey and with me, as always, Gavin Free and Andrew Panthan.
[00:36.710 --> 00:37.090]  Hiya.
[00:37.370 --> 00:40.490]  When does a little chat session become a large chat session?
[00:40.490 --> 00:44.550]  When is the cut-off? Because I feel like I would say these are at least medium chats.
[00:45.450 --> 00:48.010]  90 minutes is when it becomes a large chat session.
[00:48.490 --> 00:51.250]  Okay, 90 minutes. So we're right under the threshold.
[00:51.650 --> 00:52.350]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:52.630 --> 00:55.810]  Well, this is a double recording, so this is technically a very large chat.
[00:56.030 --> 00:56.730]  That is true.
[00:56.990 --> 01:00.130]  Does the chat stop between episodes? I think it keeps going.
[01:00.890 --> 01:02.630]  I think this is a large chat, I'd say.
[01:02.850 --> 01:05.050]  No, I think that they're two distinct chats.
[01:05.670 --> 01:07.250]  They have beginnings, middles, and ends.
[01:07.670 --> 01:08.290]  Fair play.
[01:09.390 --> 01:10.330]  I don't know if I agree.
[01:10.330 --> 01:14.990]  I also, I gotta be honest, I don't know that it fucking matters in any way whatsoever.
[01:15.790 --> 01:16.390]  I don't know.
[01:16.910 --> 01:21.110]  I'm glad Eric's here on time. There was the risk that Eric was going to be slightly late,
[01:21.150 --> 01:25.610]  but I was worried because I assume we're going to get into some arguments this episode based
[01:25.610 --> 01:28.350]  on how well we did our food challenge.
[01:28.750 --> 01:29.150]  Really?
[01:29.390 --> 01:32.930]  We might need an extra couple of judges.
[01:35.730 --> 01:40.710]  Well, I have everything documented. I wrote down all the things. I will say confidently,
[01:41.090 --> 01:46.270]  I think I have one strike. I think I have definitively at least one. Maybe there will
[01:46.270 --> 01:49.270]  be some arguing over golf balls, but I feel like I've got one.
[01:49.610 --> 01:52.150]  I also certainly have a strike or two.
[01:53.570 --> 01:54.170]  What about you, Geoff?
[01:54.710 --> 01:57.410]  Well, I guess mine would depend on...
[01:58.590 --> 01:59.490]  Well, you know, here's the deal.
[02:00.770 --> 02:06.370]  We work in a creative industry. We are creative individuals and as a group, I think we're
[02:06.370 --> 02:12.110]  highly creative. So I think if you take creativity into account, I don't know that I have any
[02:12.110 --> 02:12.450]  strikes.
[02:13.950 --> 02:19.170]  What I expect is that you seem to think that this is all an elaborate prank against you.
[02:19.450 --> 02:24.670]  Oh, absolutely I do. But I'm not upset about it or anything. I just don't for a second
[02:24.670 --> 02:28.890]  believe that G for Gavin, P for Patton, and U for fuck you, Geoff.
[02:29.530 --> 02:34.150]  Oh, uniform. I felt really dumb after the fact that none of us put together uniform,
[02:34.410 --> 02:37.910]  the thing you created. You created the bet. You got the U for uniform.
[02:38.490 --> 02:45.430]  Well, I think to be fair, I may have created the corporate structure and the idea behind
[02:45.430 --> 02:47.310]  it, but I think Gavin actually named it.
[02:47.450 --> 02:48.430]  Really? Okay.
[02:48.750 --> 02:52.030]  If we go back in time, I'm pretty sure Gavin came up with the name.
[02:52.190 --> 02:54.450]  Well, I was just trying to find a pun for meat that you would wear.
[02:54.930 --> 02:56.730]  I think that's what started it.
[02:56.830 --> 02:58.830]  Yeah. No. Okay. It's coming back now. That makes sense.
[02:59.010 --> 03:06.890]  That was the brush fire that started the statewide raging fire that destroyed all the homes at
[03:06.890 --> 03:07.110]  that moment.
[03:07.170 --> 03:08.030]  Huh. Okay.
[03:08.210 --> 03:10.530]  We have a lot to talk about outside of this food challenge.
[03:10.530 --> 03:10.890]  Oh my god.
[03:10.890 --> 03:11.830]  This is going to be dense.
[03:12.350 --> 03:14.810]  Yeah. Should we? Come on, man.
[03:14.870 --> 03:15.870]  Well, we've got to address the...
[03:18.790 --> 03:19.230]  Listen.
[03:21.050 --> 03:21.490]  Look.
[03:22.310 --> 03:23.190]  Deeply saddened.
[03:23.190 --> 03:28.650]  Deeply saddened by the loss of Coolio.
[03:30.210 --> 03:33.030]  He was a very young 59 years old.
[03:33.130 --> 03:35.770]  That is far too young to be taken from this earth.
[03:36.370 --> 03:37.850]  And what a rare talent.
[03:38.450 --> 03:44.850]  And it just really unfortunately coincided with the day that Sausage Talk came out,
[03:45.050 --> 03:49.250]  where I think Geoff decided he was on our list of people to send the cursed socks to.
[03:50.090 --> 03:51.230]  Yes, which we didn't.
[03:51.290 --> 03:52.590]  We haven't even cursed the socks yet.
[03:52.590 --> 03:56.990]  So we did not send the man any cursed anything.
[03:57.570 --> 03:59.890]  As far as I know, those socks don't even exist yet.
[04:00.570 --> 04:03.910]  It's true. I haven't cursed a single sock.
[04:04.430 --> 04:08.730]  But I was in disbelief last night when we found out.
[04:08.950 --> 04:09.330]  Yeah.
[04:09.370 --> 04:13.190]  And I was just thinking, what are the chances of that?
[04:13.270 --> 04:16.510]  And I also thought, man, if we'd somehow already got the socks out to him,
[04:16.590 --> 04:19.330]  I wouldn't be able to do this podcast anymore.
[04:19.330 --> 04:21.410]  No, I think we'd all have to.
[04:21.610 --> 04:24.490]  I think that would be a curtain call for all of us.
[04:24.830 --> 04:24.970]  Really?
[04:25.990 --> 04:29.350]  Honestly, it's just got me terrified about the cursed socks.
[04:30.450 --> 04:31.530]  I kind of don't want to do it.
[04:32.010 --> 04:33.730]  Well, we have to. We're already committed to that.
[04:34.230 --> 04:36.550]  But we don't have to send them to anybody. That's for sure.
[04:40.410 --> 04:47.090]  And all of that happened on the same day that a hurricane named Ian struck.
[04:47.490 --> 04:49.050]  I didn't even think about that.
[04:49.050 --> 04:50.690]  That was the name of it?
[04:50.970 --> 04:53.310]  That was the name of the hurricane. Hurricane Ian.
[04:53.450 --> 04:54.050]  I-A-N.
[04:55.830 --> 04:57.470]  What's going on? We have to stop.
[04:58.010 --> 04:59.190]  Yeah, it was...
[04:59.190 --> 04:59.670]  Why don't we take a break?
[05:00.830 --> 05:03.670]  Why don't we end season four right here?
[05:04.650 --> 05:06.710]  I don't know that...
[05:06.710 --> 05:07.950]  It's a dark way to end season four.
[05:08.290 --> 05:10.650]  Look, we have to have a break.
[05:10.730 --> 05:13.210]  Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. No, so this is it. This is the end of season four.
[05:13.310 --> 05:16.130]  We'll take about a 10 minute break before we start season five.
[05:16.430 --> 05:16.730]  Okay.
[05:16.890 --> 05:18.750]  Between recordings of episodes 124 and 125.
[05:18.750 --> 05:24.030]  No, just karmically, it makes me feel pretty dirty.
[05:24.410 --> 05:25.270]  I don't know why.
[05:26.590 --> 05:27.390]  Feel real bad.
[05:27.490 --> 05:30.190]  Yesterday was a really sad day in a lot of ways.
[05:30.790 --> 05:31.870]  I don't know why you feel sad.
[05:31.930 --> 05:32.890]  This is Gavin's fault.
[05:33.050 --> 05:34.330]  I mean, this is entirely on him.
[05:34.470 --> 05:35.790]  He put the curse sock.
[05:35.870 --> 05:36.550]  He has the curse.
[05:37.250 --> 05:39.630]  I don't think you or I really have anything to do with this.
[05:40.030 --> 05:44.010]  Ian, on the other hand, that's, you know, maybe a little bit more spread out.
[05:44.110 --> 05:46.590]  I think it's more fair to say that Gavin killed Coolio.
[05:47.090 --> 05:48.250]  I feel comfortable in saying that.
[05:48.250 --> 05:50.390]  I'm sort of a guilt by association.
[05:50.390 --> 05:51.550]  Maybe your cat did.
[05:52.930 --> 05:56.470]  Have you checked Geoff to see if our Coolio cards have gone up in value since?
[05:56.710 --> 06:00.730]  No, I feel like that would be that would be opportunistic and insensitive.
[06:01.010 --> 06:02.430]  Well, I don't want to sell it.
[06:02.490 --> 06:05.530]  I would never sell my I was just curious if there is a shift in the market.
[06:05.690 --> 06:07.050]  We lost a legend.
[06:07.750 --> 06:08.830]  I don't know.
[06:08.970 --> 06:09.690]  I don't know.
[06:09.730 --> 06:15.950]  But I will tell you that that my card has become priceless to me now.
[06:16.430 --> 06:16.970]  Oh, absolutely.
[06:16.970 --> 06:18.850]  It was a prized possession before,
[06:19.070 --> 06:22.310]  but now it's like it's ratcheted up in like personal value.
[06:23.310 --> 06:25.570]  I think it was maybe his only autograph card.
[06:25.870 --> 06:27.250]  There may have been one other.
[06:27.770 --> 06:29.510]  I don't remember if it was an autograph card or not,
[06:29.530 --> 06:31.630]  but he was in like a hip hop trading card set.
[06:32.170 --> 06:33.550]  So it's a rare card.
[06:33.850 --> 06:34.750]  He had a rare Coolio.
[06:35.210 --> 06:35.850]  Pretty rare card.
[06:37.790 --> 06:38.570]  What a man.
[06:38.970 --> 06:40.370]  Well, we lost a good one.
[06:40.810 --> 06:41.210]  We did.
[06:41.590 --> 06:42.210]  Yeah, we did.
[06:42.530 --> 06:44.150]  I'm glad the socks didn't go through.
[06:44.150 --> 06:46.390]  As long as nothing happens to...
[06:46.390 --> 06:47.570]  Who else do we say we're going to send?
[06:47.610 --> 06:49.270]  Kenan and Kel and Jackie Chan?
[06:49.410 --> 06:50.690]  Don't reinforce it, man.
[06:50.890 --> 06:51.570]  I'm just saying.
[06:52.310 --> 06:54.070]  Is there anyone else we want to send the socks to?
[06:54.750 --> 06:56.410]  I don't think we should send them to anyone.
[06:57.090 --> 07:00.550]  I don't think we need to give away any promo socks.
[07:01.030 --> 07:02.930]  Does it only work if it's not intentional?
[07:03.790 --> 07:10.490]  Do you think if we sent somebody a sock as like a threat of sorts, would that be okay?
[07:10.910 --> 07:11.310]  No.
[07:11.430 --> 07:11.870]  Would that work?
[07:11.870 --> 07:12.530]  I think it's even worse.
[07:12.530 --> 07:14.030]  I mean, that's a threat.
[07:14.210 --> 07:15.830]  That sounds criminal.
[07:16.690 --> 07:18.450]  I'm not saying like a serious threat.
[07:18.770 --> 07:21.630]  I'm just, you know, a little intimidation, potentially.
[07:22.370 --> 07:23.830]  Who do you want to intimidate?
[07:24.670 --> 07:26.150]  Who do I want to intimidate?
[07:26.170 --> 07:26.930]  That's a great question.
[07:27.850 --> 07:29.570]  I would want to intimidate...
[07:31.670 --> 07:32.330]  I don't know.
[07:32.390 --> 07:37.750]  All the sports teams I care about are on fire or in the trash in some way.
[07:37.810 --> 07:40.850]  It feels useless to try to leverage a sports advantage.
[07:40.850 --> 07:42.430]  Everyone's already in the hole.
[07:43.370 --> 07:44.190]  That's a great point.
[07:44.290 --> 07:46.730]  I don't really have anyone I need vengeance against at this moment.
[07:46.830 --> 07:48.230]  But I'm just throwing it out there.
[07:48.290 --> 07:50.010]  Something for you to hold on to, for sure.
[07:50.110 --> 07:50.230]  Yeah.
[07:50.390 --> 07:56.930]  The thing that I love the most about this start to this podcast is how morbidly quiet
[07:56.930 --> 08:00.710]  Gavin is through the whole thing, because I know he is legitimately deeply troubled,
[08:00.970 --> 08:08.070]  which I think is so odd for Gavin, who is a man of science and doesn't believe in anything like...
[08:08.070 --> 08:09.050]  Yeah, I super don't.
[08:09.050 --> 08:12.990]  I love being a skeptic of this shit, but it is haunting.
[08:13.430 --> 08:16.490]  I would be so goddamn mad if I was Edgar Wright,
[08:16.910 --> 08:21.710]  listening to Gavin be all upset and solemn about a thing completely unrelated
[08:21.710 --> 08:26.570]  and joyfully talking about an event that I got pissed on due to his family.
[08:27.830 --> 08:28.770]  We don't know.
[08:29.010 --> 08:31.750]  I really hope he didn't get pissed on, and we don't know that he got pissed on.
[08:31.750 --> 08:34.850]  It's almost certain he got pissed on based on what he said.
[08:35.490 --> 08:40.010]  Look, if he... I'm gonna have to start working on a new guilt basket if that's the case.
[08:40.550 --> 08:44.370]  I think I know Gavin pretty well after all these years,
[08:44.530 --> 08:50.550]  and I would say that the guilt runs deep in Gavin, and I wouldn't be surprised if on his deathbed
[08:50.550 --> 08:56.710]  he still feels bad about potentially being associated with urine going on Edgar Wright.
[08:58.050 --> 08:58.670]  I'd agree.
[08:58.890 --> 09:03.150]  He'll be 98 years old and he'll still be thinking about it.
[09:03.150 --> 09:06.510]  The five things he has to feel guilty or embarrassed about in his life.
[09:06.870 --> 09:10.190]  Look, that's not a level of embarrassment you can just walk away from.
[09:10.590 --> 09:10.950]  Nuts.
[09:11.870 --> 09:15.190]  And it's through blood, too. I didn't even do it. I didn't piss on him.
[09:16.330 --> 09:19.930]  That's true. And I still feel like you'll be scared to talk to Edgar Wright.
[09:20.010 --> 09:21.670]  You still will be avoiding him at that age.
[09:21.950 --> 09:28.010]  Your final words, you'll come in, you'll be on your deathbed, and you know,
[09:28.050 --> 09:30.750]  like the big reveal or whatever, like your final words, you'll be like,
[09:30.750 --> 09:35.650]  come closer. I need to tell you something. Tell Edgar Wright I'm sorry.
[09:36.530 --> 09:39.750]  What I didn't tell you is that as I progressed through the airport,
[09:40.570 --> 09:44.950]  I was sort of, because I kept ending up with him, I was, I feel like my confidence was actually
[09:44.950 --> 09:50.190]  building up, like I might have said something. And then, and this is before I heard the piss story.
[09:50.730 --> 09:55.350]  And then we were both going through like the automated passport gate thing at the same time.
[09:55.670 --> 09:58.010]  And my door didn't open.
[09:58.350 --> 09:58.570]  Yeah.
[09:58.570 --> 10:03.890]  So, uh, I took my passport out and tried to put it in, but I dropped it
[10:04.430 --> 10:07.930]  outside of the little gate and then I got locked out. It closed.
[10:11.290 --> 10:14.850]  My bag was just stuck in the, in the bit with the camera.
[10:17.510 --> 10:20.090]  And I watched Edgar Wright just go straight through it. So I was like, Oh,
[10:20.110 --> 10:25.530]  I just wasn't meant to be. I had to wave down the guy to be like, I'm sorry. I got,
[10:25.530 --> 10:27.490]  I got stuck outside the little gate.
[10:30.950 --> 10:35.130]  But it said, it said that there were two people in there. So I was like, I stepped back
[10:35.130 --> 10:39.590]  to be like, well, maybe it needs to reset. But as I stepped back, the passport flew out of my hand
[10:39.590 --> 10:44.930]  and slid out under the back of the gate. And then it closed when I was on the other side.
[10:45.950 --> 10:49.110]  You were all hot and bothered by Edgar Wright. You were all...
[10:50.350 --> 10:50.990]  Yeah, I know.
[10:51.550 --> 10:53.350]  You were flummoxed. By the way,
[10:53.350 --> 10:59.370]  Nick asked if piss is thicker than blood, which I think is a hilarious thing to say.
[11:00.490 --> 11:05.210]  No, it's so much worse because he's like a hero of mine. So it's like, you really don't want to
[11:05.210 --> 11:08.930]  goof. I would much rather not say anything to him than make a goof of myself.
[11:09.330 --> 11:14.050]  Well, here's, I have two thoughts here about this, Gav, that I've been actually thinking
[11:14.050 --> 11:18.830]  about for a little bit. One, and this just, I think, further illustrates my point with your
[11:18.830 --> 11:25.570]  passport fumble. I think the universe was intervening. Like, if it had happened,
[11:26.270 --> 11:30.470]  if you had crowbarred the Edgar Wright conversation in, and this is, by the way,
[11:30.650 --> 11:38.010]  this is why I stand by my assertion that you should never meet your heroes, never meet anyone
[11:38.010 --> 11:41.930]  you look up to. That is why I will, if I see Howard Stern or David Lynch walking down the
[11:41.930 --> 11:46.210]  street, I am turning around and I'm going the other way. I don't want anything to do with them.
[11:46.890 --> 11:52.910]  Because the best thing you can do, like, you get a hundred on the test, that, like, that grade,
[11:53.210 --> 11:57.710]  you get that grade for not embarrassing yourself. Everything else that can happen is worse than
[11:57.710 --> 12:03.810]  that. And so what probably would have happened is you, you would have rubbed him the wrong way,
[12:03.890 --> 12:08.170]  and he would have given you a pithy response, or you would have fumbled and embarrassed yourself,
[12:08.210 --> 12:12.430]  and you would have just been torn up about it, or whatever it is. Every time Edgar Wright movies
[12:12.430 --> 12:15.850]  come out, you would go to watch it, and you would remember that, and you would feel a little bad
[12:15.850 --> 12:19.370]  about yourself, and a little shittier, and it would ruin a little bit of Edgar Wright for you.
[12:19.570 --> 12:25.670]  So the universe was doing you a huge solid by, by keeping you two apart. Also, my other thought is,
[12:25.910 --> 12:30.350]  you say it's not your fault, guilt by association, you clearly know what your family is capable of,
[12:30.410 --> 12:35.230]  you went out in public with them, uh, you have, you, you should have known better.
[12:35.450 --> 12:39.270]  Uh, I feel like my family's usually good. I guess it's just, like, everyone's new to the
[12:39.270 --> 12:43.310]  traveling with, like, it's, it was everyone's first time traveling with this new child.
[12:43.310 --> 12:46.270]  So I think there's just, like, learning curves happening.
[12:46.830 --> 12:47.270]  Yeah.
[12:47.990 --> 12:52.490]  Usually it's a pretty inoffensive family just minding its own business. I promise.
[12:54.870 --> 13:00.490]  Do you have that with any celebrities, Geoff? Like, you have a specific experience or interaction
[13:00.490 --> 13:04.790]  that has changed the way you look at them, and now whenever you see their work, you think about
[13:04.790 --> 13:07.270]  them in a different way? Like, it ruins it for you?
[13:07.470 --> 13:12.530]  I mean, I feel like I've told my, my Charles Barkley story one million times.
[13:12.570 --> 13:12.910]  Absolutely.
[13:12.910 --> 13:18.270]  But that did, I mean, that, that's where this comes from, right? Like, and I'm, I'll be honest
[13:18.270 --> 13:24.510]  with you. I'm, I'm fairly neurotic about it. Uh, I, I really don't want to meet, if someone wants
[13:24.510 --> 13:29.410]  to meet me, that's fine. Uh, I got no problem with that, but I don't want to meet anyone else
[13:29.410 --> 13:35.330]  that I look up to or admire. Um, and it all stems from meeting Charles Barkley when I was 17.
[13:35.610 --> 13:42.230]  Yeah. And it did ruin, he was, he and Larry Bird were my heroes, and Bird was on his way out,
[13:42.630 --> 13:47.950]  because his back was, was falling apart. And Charles was kind of at the height of his,
[13:48.490 --> 13:54.390]  of his, uh, abilities as an NBA player. Uh, and, well, he's still on the come up a little bit,
[13:54.430 --> 13:59.050]  actually, because he had some really good years of the Suns. Um, but, uh, and so I,
[13:59.130 --> 14:03.270]  and he was from Alabama, and I just didn't, growing up in Alabama, I never, I never liked
[14:03.270 --> 14:07.430]  Alabama. I never connected with Alabama. There weren't a lot of people that I looked up to from
[14:07.430 --> 14:12.770]  Alabama. You know, I had like, I don't have a lot of great, famous role models. You know,
[14:13.090 --> 14:17.450]  I had, I had fucking Jimmy Buffett, which was like his, whatever, it's fine. Uh, I had Hank
[14:17.450 --> 14:22.790]  Aaron, which was cool. And I had Charles Barkley. That's a good one. And, uh, yeah. And so, um,
[14:22.870 --> 14:28.890]  I was beyond crestfallen, and I, I didn't like him for years and years and years after that.
[14:28.950 --> 14:34.690]  And it wasn't until the NBA on TNT, and when I, I just was so impossibly entertained by the guy
[14:34.690 --> 14:39.270]  again, and I really, I, uh, I fell back in love with him. And now I love him more than I ever did
[14:39.270 --> 14:43.910]  when I was a kid. Do you have any of those, Gavin? Would this add on to it, or would Edgar
[14:43.910 --> 14:48.650]  Wright be your first one where, where your view of their work would forever be changed? I don't
[14:48.650 --> 14:52.810]  think I've ever had one to that extent. No. It's good. Yeah. I think I've always done,
[14:53.010 --> 14:57.010]  I've always done okay. Have you ever had one with content where it wasn't even like a personal
[14:57.010 --> 15:02.070]  interaction? It was just like something they did changed how you looked at them as an actor or
[15:02.070 --> 15:12.430]  performer in some way. Yeah. That's fair. That's fair. I meant within the work itself. I'm not
[15:12.430 --> 15:16.070]  saying go into anything personal. That's a little like a deep dark secret. I'll just,
[15:16.190 --> 15:22.810]  I'll just spin this around cause that went to a sad place. Are we just cutting like so much from
[15:22.810 --> 15:27.250]  this episode? Is that what's happening? Are we just like, can we release this? I don't think
[15:27.250 --> 15:31.690]  it needs to be cut. No, I'm going to, I'll pivot to a thing. I think Geoff, you and I have talked
[15:31.690 --> 15:36.490]  about this in the past and I'm sure we can relate on this. There's a character in the TV show,
[15:36.570 --> 15:44.730]  the shield, something happens to them later in the show. That is so unexpected and jarring.
[15:45.230 --> 15:50.130]  It's all I can see that like, it's all I think about when I see that actor, regardless of whatever
[15:50.130 --> 15:54.950]  role that person does. All I think of what scene are you, what character are you referring to?
[15:55.870 --> 16:02.010]  Oh man, it's been so long. I don't remember the names. Acevedo, I want to say season five,
[16:03.530 --> 16:10.150]  something horrible, like truly horrible character. And that's all I think about when I see them
[16:10.150 --> 16:14.910]  because it was so jarring and unexpected. I've never seen any other show do that. Like it's just,
[16:15.030 --> 16:18.770]  I, I cannot disassociate that moment from that guy. I thought maybe you were talking,
[16:18.770 --> 16:21.550]  I was trying to think of like most shocking moments in the show. And I thought, no,
[16:21.550 --> 16:25.250]  there's a lot in that show. When Lemonhead gets the grenade or like when Ronnie and
[16:25.250 --> 16:29.790]  when Ronnie meets the oven, you know, I got to watch this show. It was a great show.
[16:30.190 --> 16:36.950]  Listen, Gus once described it to me as like, uh, sitting down and having a series of tiny heart
[16:36.950 --> 16:42.130]  attacks for one hour at a time, uh, once a week. And that's what the show was like. It is intense.
[16:42.690 --> 16:46.750]  That's what Ozark was like for me. I haven't seen that. Yeah. Ozark was very good,
[16:46.750 --> 16:52.170]  but it was a lot slower, a lot slower than the shield. You know, one of the things I think most
[16:52.170 --> 16:56.730]  about, and I think the shield Geoff, which is funny because it's like, as you said, it is a series of
[16:56.730 --> 17:01.010]  endless heart attacks. The acting is so intense. It's like, there's so many different crazy arcs
[17:01.010 --> 17:05.590]  you go through. One of the first things I think about, and that stuck with me with that show
[17:06.110 --> 17:12.370]  is a random subplot in season one, where there's a dispute, like a domestic dispute between these
[17:12.370 --> 17:18.830]  people and somebody spray paints the word hoe across their front door and like red letters.
[17:19.570 --> 17:23.230]  And they, they talk to the person, then they go back to the house later. And it says shoe,
[17:23.410 --> 17:27.170]  like they just added an S to it because they didn't know how else to fix it. So they just
[17:27.170 --> 17:32.690]  made it a different word. That gag has stuck with me for years. It's the main thing I think about
[17:32.690 --> 17:38.730]  that show. There's so many insane, intense moments. And I just think of hoe to shoe when I think of
[17:38.730 --> 17:45.270]  shoe. I also have like some vivid graffiti cover up memory from a show from Alan Partridge.
[17:45.710 --> 17:50.990]  Someone spray paints cock piss Partridge on his car and he, uh, he asked someone to fix it for
[17:50.990 --> 17:54.870]  him. And then he, the reveal is that they just sprayed new letters on it. It says cook pass
[17:55.310 --> 18:00.090]  Babtridge. And that's just like one of those things that's also just burned visually into my,
[18:00.390 --> 18:02.730]  into my head. It's funny how those are the same gag really.
[18:04.290 --> 18:09.730]  Uh, uh, well, did we cover all the, all the heavy news so that we can talk about our contest now?
[18:10.050 --> 18:13.690]  I think I just realized we're fucking we're 20 minutes in. I feel like we should go into the
[18:13.690 --> 18:17.190]  alphabet. We got a lot to discuss. Well, I guess depending on how much it got cut,
[18:17.290 --> 18:20.690]  maybe we're two minutes in. I'm not sure. I have a feeling that you've completely
[18:20.690 --> 18:25.410]  fucked this. And so my Geoff out of paranoia that you were somehow the butt of a joke.
[18:25.750 --> 18:31.410]  Uh, okay. That's my assumption. I have a few ideas because we had a little text conversation
[18:31.410 --> 18:37.590]  last night and you applied that you did something maybe not intended. You went off the path,
[18:37.690 --> 18:42.070]  but was creative. I speculated in my, my own head. I thought maybe you went for the most
[18:42.070 --> 18:47.130]  strikes possible. I'm excited to see your list. Has everybody written down?
[18:47.850 --> 18:51.570]  No, I just took, I just took photos of my stuff. Okay. I took, I wrote down everything.
[18:52.350 --> 18:57.590]  Okay. I wrote down mine. Should we just post this? Sure. Let's go one at a time. Let's go
[18:57.590 --> 19:02.770]  one at a time. So let's go alphabetically. Uh, you, okay. Not the letter you, but you as an
[19:02.770 --> 19:09.050]  Andrew. Okay. Uh, let me, let me copy and paste my Monday. It's going to do my first day. I'll
[19:09.050 --> 19:16.050]  talk to you about the adversity I encountered the first day immediately. Okay. Going with Monday.
[19:16.510 --> 19:24.110]  First thing I did. Six things. Yeah. That's what I ate. Pineapple. Well,
[19:24.110 --> 19:28.510]  pineapple chunks and popcorn could be next to nothing. Yeah. There was like snacks. There's
[19:28.510 --> 19:34.350]  throwaway snacks. So I had pancakes. I realized after I had ordered the pancakes, I cannot put
[19:34.350 --> 19:41.670]  butter on them. It's a real issue. Dry pancakes are not nearly as enjoyable as the thing. I was
[19:41.670 --> 19:45.810]  all excited. I was like, I'm going to start my day with some pancakes, some potato patties. We're
[19:45.810 --> 19:49.710]  getting this off on a good foot. Oh, I can't use butter. I feel like it would be against the rules
[19:49.710 --> 19:56.030]  if I use butter. So that was brutal. Uh, then it's got some nice pecan pie. That sounds brutal.
[19:56.230 --> 20:00.110]  Oh, it was terrible. It was a tough way to start. I had to really bounce back from that.
[20:00.390 --> 20:05.010]  It was the pecan pie. Wanted pumpkin. Didn't have any at the store. It was tragic. Once again,
[20:06.050 --> 20:10.450]  hash brown, a potato patty, by the way. No, it's a potato patty. Okay. What do you mean?
[20:10.950 --> 20:13.350]  Never heard that. Never heard the word potato patty before in my life.
[20:13.610 --> 20:17.770]  I will send you a, I'll send you the product. I'm going to assume it's a Canadian thing. I,
[20:17.770 --> 20:21.070]  I'm not going to, I'm not going to knock it. I just agree with Gavin. I think it's a hash brown,
[20:21.150 --> 20:25.490]  probably. Well, if it was a hash brown, a hash brown is a hundred percent potato.
[20:25.790 --> 20:28.610]  How would that? Okay. So the answer to Gavin's question is yes.
[20:31.090 --> 20:35.630]  I'm just saying I, I don't, if you want to give me a strike for potato patty, that's fine.
[20:36.010 --> 20:43.070]  No, no, I'm fine. I don't give a fuck. I was just clarifying. I, I appreciate the creativity of it.
[20:43.090 --> 20:47.450]  I liked it. It's good. It's like, there's a, yeah, no, it's nice. It's fun to say potato patty.
[20:48.250 --> 20:52.250]  It's a, it's like the McDonald's hash brown. That's a definite potato patty. I'd say.
[20:52.570 --> 20:57.050]  Okay. So again, when he asked if it was a hash brown and you did a song and dance,
[20:57.070 --> 21:00.970]  the answer was yes. Well, I'm just, you know, different words for different things.
[21:01.010 --> 21:05.510]  I think that's the point. Hey, I like, I like where you're going with that. Just remember
[21:05.510 --> 21:09.050]  different words for different things when it's my turn. Okay. I really appreciate that.
[21:09.710 --> 21:15.630]  We, uh, oh, that's unfortunate. Anyway, we're moving on to pineapple chunks. That's the
[21:16.350 --> 21:20.590]  McDonald's is offering pineapple. So I got some pineapple from McDonald's. It's delicious. Got a
[21:20.590 --> 21:27.050]  few bags carried me through the week, potentially in some ways. Ran out of popcorn and, uh, end of
[21:27.050 --> 21:31.650]  the day, pepperoni pizza was delicious. And that was my Monday. There was, um, on that, I have to
[21:31.650 --> 21:39.690]  reference the text conversation we were in, um, Monday, 8.00 PM. Andrew texts Geoff and myself.
[21:39.950 --> 21:45.210]  I couldn't put butter on my pancakes this morning, but we are holding strong. And then a picture of
[21:45.210 --> 21:52.090]  pepperoni pizza. Stay strong, everyone. We can do this. Neither of us replied. No, no, I had nothing
[21:52.090 --> 22:02.030]  to say to that person. So are we, do you want me to continue on with my, my day or? A real quick
[22:02.030 --> 22:06.230]  question. Do you know, does pineapple chunk, does that count as a P for pineapple or C for chunk?
[22:06.610 --> 22:13.550]  I think it's a definite P. Continue, please. Do we got any strikes on Monday? Are we doing any?
[22:13.550 --> 22:19.270]  I mean, I think potato patties is a, I mean, if I wish you would, if you took a photo of it and
[22:19.270 --> 22:24.910]  it's like, there's a box that says potato patties, uh, then that would help, but I don't care. Based
[22:24.910 --> 22:30.230]  on what I've got coming up, I would like to not strike any of that. Yeah, I'm kind of in the same
[22:30.230 --> 22:36.590]  boat. I'll, uh, you know what? I'll drop a discord photo of, uh, what I, what I consume. And while I
[22:36.590 --> 22:43.430]  do that, I will copy and paste my Tuesday, Tuesday items. We have a continuation of sorts. I finished
[22:43.430 --> 22:47.490]  off my pancake for the previous day. Couldn't get through all of them because a lack of butter.
[22:47.610 --> 22:54.730]  This wasn't enjoyable. Had some more pineapple, leftover pepperoni pizza, enjoyed some poutine.
[22:55.310 --> 22:59.030]  And then we just kind of had some snack items. We had, uh, the peanut butter pretzel. I don't
[22:59.030 --> 23:03.450]  know if you've ever had the Kirkland peanut butter pretzel, like little, little treat thing.
[23:03.650 --> 23:08.710]  I have. Oh, it's delicious. They're great. Had some of those, had some peanuts discussed
[23:08.710 --> 23:14.650]  about recently. Ended the day with pineapple. Oh, you got pineapple, that's what I saw.
[23:15.170 --> 23:19.430]  I've got pineapple because I kept track of what I ate and when. So I had pineapple in the morning,
[23:19.690 --> 23:23.010]  had some pineapple at the very end of the day. First, one of the first things, one of the last
[23:23.010 --> 23:28.890]  things I ever ate, uh, for that day. Uh, I'll quickly drop in a potato patty photo,
[23:29.030 --> 23:33.150]  McCain's potato patties. You win. I feel like, I feel like that counts. Fair play.
[23:33.150 --> 23:39.550]  Fair play. Uh, okay. And now Wednesday, Wednesday is my potentially, you can argue,
[23:39.690 --> 23:43.950]  maybe other strikes. I have a definite strike on Wednesday that I will get into.
[23:45.890 --> 23:49.570]  Paste. Wednesday, we had some more peanut butter pretzels, some more peanuts, pulled pork.
[23:49.570 --> 23:50.350]  Oh, I see the strike.
[23:50.810 --> 23:56.210]  This time. Then dark chocolate, dark chocolate. That was,
[23:57.350 --> 23:59.930]  so you want me to get into why, what happened with the dark chocolate?
[24:00.470 --> 24:01.510]  I would appreciate it.
[24:01.510 --> 24:07.530]  I had a bar of dark chocolate on my desk. I don't drink. I'm not a drinker. I'm not a big drinker,
[24:07.570 --> 24:11.850]  but I had some cider to celebrate an event. It was just in my fridge. I was like, you know,
[24:11.890 --> 24:16.110]  I'll have a cider. Sometimes I have like allergic reactions when I drink alcohol.
[24:16.270 --> 24:21.530]  I was all stuffed up. I had a headache. I felt tipsy. Just one cider could really take me down.
[24:21.930 --> 24:26.550]  I was not feeling good. I was feeling out of it. I was like, I just need something to like
[24:26.550 --> 24:30.610]  eat right now. All this chalk chocolate seems like a great idea. That'd be great.
[24:30.610 --> 24:37.250]  I love this lint dark chocolate. Ate half the bar. It was so easy to do this. I would forget
[24:37.250 --> 24:41.630]  at times and I had moments of panic that I can only eat pea foods. I was halfway through the
[24:41.630 --> 24:47.350]  lint bar and I was like, oh God, this isn't, this isn't, this is, there's no pea in this.
[24:47.710 --> 24:52.390]  I am fucked. This is a strike. I didn't want to cover it. I felt that'd be dishonorable.
[24:52.530 --> 24:58.030]  I fucked up. I had a cider. Lost my edge a little bit. Rounded the day out. Sweet potato fries.
[24:58.030 --> 25:05.070]  Some pumpkin pie. Finally found some. Great, great dessert. Great treat. Perfect for the season.
[25:05.730 --> 25:11.050]  Fantastic in all ways. And then peaches. Oh, and today, I forgot. I've only had one thing to eat
[25:11.050 --> 25:19.330]  today. I think the perfect way to round out my alphabet, Thursday, today, for my hubby's bagels,
[25:19.950 --> 25:25.630]  add a pretzel. Wow. Delicious. Okay. Very nice. So this is my alphabet. These are my things. How
[25:25.630 --> 25:29.330]  are we feeling about strikes? I know dark chocolate, definite. Dark chocolate's a strike.
[25:29.550 --> 25:32.330]  I think that's the only one. Yeah, I think you get one strike, buddy.
[25:33.510 --> 25:37.670]  Wow. You did double up a few times, but there's no... Yeah, we talked about that.
[25:38.090 --> 25:43.530]  You had two pretzels in two days, wasn't it? Yeah. You had a pretzel yesterday and today.
[25:43.790 --> 25:47.090]  Different pretzel types though. The pretzel from my hubby's bagel, like a pastry pretzel.
[25:47.530 --> 25:50.630]  The snack pretzel is more like a chip almost with peanut butter in the middle.
[25:51.590 --> 25:57.710]  It's like a hard, salty pretzel. Yeah, man, I think you did very, very well.
[25:58.210 --> 26:02.050]  I feel great about this. Once we all talk about it, I'll have some more things to
[26:02.050 --> 26:05.510]  discuss regarding this, but let's go to the other people now. I hate the way you do that.
[26:10.560 --> 26:14.680]  Today's episode is sponsored by Honey, the easy way to save when shopping on your iPhone or
[26:14.680 --> 26:19.360]  computer. I love to shop online. I hate going into the store. Just everything about it stinks.
[26:19.360 --> 26:24.720]  I shop online as much as I possibly can for regardless of what I'm getting.
[26:25.820 --> 26:29.460]  The issue though when I shop online is I never have a promo code ready to go.
[26:29.820 --> 26:34.560]  But thanks to Honey, manually searching for coupon codes is a thing of the past. Honey is

[26:43.740 --> 26:48.520]  the Honey button appears and all you have to do is click apply coupons. Wait a few seconds as
[26:48.520 --> 26:52.880]  Honey searches for coupons it can find for that site. If Honey finds a working coupon,
[26:53.020 --> 26:57.940]  you'll watch the prices drop. I've saved money on things like clothing and food, pizza,
[26:58.420 --> 27:02.540]  all sorts of stuff. It's a fantastic service and it's so incredibly easy to use.

[29:07.860 --> 29:13.560]  The world needed a hero. It got Black Adam. From New Line Cinema, Dwayne Johnson stars in
[29:13.560 --> 29:18.880]  the action-adventure Black Adam, the first-ever feature film to explore the story of the DC
[29:18.880 --> 29:23.660]  superhero, comes to the big screen under the direction of Jama Collette Serra, previously
[29:23.660 --> 29:28.920]  directed Jungle Cruise. An ancient conduct, Teth-Adam was bestowed the almighty powers of
[29:28.920 --> 29:34.120]  the gods. After using these powers for vengeance, he was imprisoned, becoming Black Adam. Nearly
[29:34.120 --> 29:39.860]  5,000 years have passed, and Black Adam has gone from man to myth to legend. Now released,
[29:39.980 --> 29:45.060]  his unique form of justice, born out of rage, is challenged by modern-day heroes who form the
[29:45.060 --> 29:51.860]  Justice Society. Hawkman, Doctor Fate, Atom Smasher, and Cyclone. New Line Cinema presents
[29:51.860 --> 29:57.900]  a seven-buck slash finco production, a Jama Collette Serra film, Black Adam, smashing into
[29:57.900 --> 30:03.320]  theaters and IMAX internationally beginning on October 19th, and North America on October 21st,
[30:03.360 --> 30:08.980]  2022. It'll be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures. You can watch Black Adam in
[30:08.980 --> 30:14.800]  theaters and IMAX internationally on October 19th, and in North America on October 21st.
[30:16.680 --> 30:24.180]  Okay, uh, Gavin? Okay, well, I've got pictures, so why don't we, uh... How many photos did you
[30:24.180 --> 30:29.940]  take for this? Oh, a lot. Okay, okay, I'm ready. Um, and I'm expecting strikes. It was, it was
[30:29.940 --> 30:35.160]  more difficult than I thought. Um, so let's say I did a few things, I've not done it, I've not
[30:35.160 --> 30:42.060]  taken every picture of every meal, so I had this a few times. All right, so we got some green grapes
[30:42.060 --> 30:52.400]  in Greek yogurt. Yep. You know. Uh, another morning I had some of these. Uh, oh yeah,
[30:52.400 --> 30:57.300]  okay. Those are gross, by the way. That is, uh, that was the worst thing I ate. Those overnight
[30:57.300 --> 31:04.000]  grains are absolutely disgusting. That was some soggy shit. I do. I'm not gonna throw a strike
[31:04.000 --> 31:08.160]  on you for the Greek yogurt, but I just really like the idea of referring to what you're eating
[31:08.160 --> 31:13.780]  as Greek. That's the clue. You're just eating Greek. Tub of Greek. Just remember that you
[31:13.780 --> 31:19.020]  didn't, you didn't strike him for that. Thank you very much. I seem to have not taken a picture of
[31:19.020 --> 31:23.320]  you, but you can see it in the top right corner of my green grapes and Greek yogurt picture.
[31:23.800 --> 31:31.920]  Those are some, uh, some goldfish. I had some as a snack. Um, back in the old fa- I'll have to go
[31:31.920 --> 31:38.980]  to my favorites every time. That'll be good. Uh, we had as some snacks, a granola bar. That's a
[31:38.980 --> 31:46.440]  good one. And another morning I had just some straight up granola. Okay. Had that, I poured
[31:46.440 --> 31:51.380]  that into the Greek yogurt that morning. You poured it into the Greek is what you mean. Yeah.
[31:51.480 --> 31:55.960]  I put it into the Greek. Yeah. The problem with what you're doing here though, Gavin, and I'm sure
[31:55.960 --> 32:02.420]  I'm guilty of this too, is you're using goldfish crackers. So you're focusing on the brand for
[32:02.420 --> 32:08.000]  goldfish and you're ignoring, you're not referring, you didn't say I ate kind. I had a thing of kind.
[32:08.240 --> 32:12.280]  Yeah. What he's doing, what he's doing is he's, he's setting a baseline that's going to help me
[32:12.280 --> 32:17.020]  out a lot. Now, the reason I thought that'd be okay, I know we weren't going to go for like an
[32:17.020 --> 32:22.340]  Oreo isn't an O, it's a cookie, right? But they are shaped like a goldfish. So I thought that
[32:22.340 --> 32:27.280]  made it more okay. You know what? Yeah, that's fine. I would give maybe a half strike on that
[32:27.280 --> 32:32.980]  based off that you've removed me. I don't think it's a strike at all. Eric's written question
[32:32.980 --> 32:39.900]  marks. Go ahead, Eric. You, you think it counts because it's shaped like a goldfish? Well, I
[32:39.900 --> 32:45.840]  might help me a little bit more. Again, I don't have a vote in here. I think that there was some
[32:45.840 --> 32:49.760]  stuff that Andrew had that was on the line. I think there's some stuff that you have that's
[32:49.760 --> 32:54.640]  flagrant, but again, I don't have a vote, so I'm going to, you know, we'll just keep going. I'm
[32:54.640 --> 33:00.100]  curious to see what else you got. Garden vegetables. You're insane. That's crazy.
[33:01.800 --> 33:08.160]  Okay. That one, that one, I might deserve a strike on. Um, I also, I got pretty adventurous
[33:08.160 --> 33:15.780]  because I was running out of ideas. Had myself for dinner, half a pint of gumbo. Oh, that's a
[33:15.780 --> 33:23.620]  good one. That's a great one. Never had that before. Um, uh, I also bought as a snack on one of the
[33:23.620 --> 33:28.700]  days, some sugar-free gummy bears, which I'm told you shouldn't eat a lot of because you're shit
[33:28.700 --> 33:34.740]  liquid. So I only had a few of those for the, for the evening. A little bit, a little bit of gelato.
[33:37.480 --> 33:45.960]  Nice. That's a great one. What flavor is that? That was a lot of caramel. Yeah. Um, now I just,
[33:46.040 --> 33:50.120]  I just have to agree with what we were saying earlier, where like you use brand name for some
[33:50.120 --> 33:54.540]  stuff and not other stuff. And it's making me nuts. Like if you would have, if you would have
[33:54.540 --> 34:00.560]  had tea, I feel like you still would have eaten this because it says Talenti. So I think, right.
[34:03.160 --> 34:08.620]  Right. But what I'm saying is that you've used brand names for some things, but not everything.
[34:08.840 --> 34:14.580]  So I feel like if you had tea, you still would have eaten this. It is seeing some of your picks.
[34:14.960 --> 34:19.860]  Seeing some of your picks, Gavin, it does make, I had a conversation before earlier today with
[34:19.860 --> 34:25.960]  Eric and which we had a slight debate, whether baked potato count for me. So for you with some
[34:25.960 --> 34:31.200]  of the, the leaps, the goldfish, the kind bar, you got a, you got a few extensions here.
[34:31.540 --> 34:34.960]  I didn't know whether this one, oops. Oh, that's too big. That one.
[34:35.240 --> 34:39.020]  Isn't it stupid how some photos are too big and others aren't. Makes no sense.
[34:39.140 --> 34:41.680]  Yeah. Um, okay. Are you ready? Are you ready for a strike?
[34:42.340 --> 34:44.480]  Um, oh, I can't wait. Am I going to slack?
[34:44.820 --> 34:49.440]  Now this, no, no, no, uh, no, the, the, the one that didn't post, I'll, I'll give it to you later.
[34:49.540 --> 34:53.840]  It was a ginger shot, which I didn't know whether it was food or not, or a drink,
[34:53.840 --> 34:57.980]  but it was just like a probiotic ginger juice.
[34:58.220 --> 35:00.860]  I would say it's a drink. Either way. That's fine.
[35:01.120 --> 35:05.180]  I can send you the fact that it made my, oh, no, I can't send you that. That's too big as well.
[35:05.620 --> 35:09.940]  I'll just go and shove it up my ass. Next one. You want to see the, you want to see the strike?
[35:10.160 --> 35:11.660]  I want to see the strike so bad.
[35:11.800 --> 35:17.900]  Now this was because, uh, you know, I had people over, everyone's ordering the same food. Uh,
[35:18.220 --> 35:20.720]  I had to make do with what I had access to.
[35:20.720 --> 35:24.910]  I mean, it's just sushi. You've just, you've had sushi. That's not...
[35:25.580 --> 35:31.760]  But does it help you that I ordered the Gandhi's Inferno, the Godzilla roll and the geisha roll?
[35:32.580 --> 35:36.100]  I thought you're going to argue that they're green. I appreciate that you went with,
[35:36.100 --> 35:39.640]  with green, the G for what they were called. It's still sushi. That's a strike.
[35:40.060 --> 35:42.160]  Yeah. And, uh, none of them were good.
[35:42.480 --> 35:42.920]  Oh no!
[35:42.920 --> 35:44.840]  And they're from San Francisco, apparently.
[35:45.300 --> 35:49.360]  Well, I think that's just where DoorDash is from. Uh, uh, let me introduce you to probably my,
[35:49.360 --> 35:55.160]  my best meal of the entire event. We've got a garden salad with ginger dressing,
[35:55.520 --> 36:00.360]  garlic bread, some ground beef sauce, and some gnocchi.
[36:01.020 --> 36:03.460]  That looks delicious. That's a lot of G's right there.
[36:03.520 --> 36:09.000]  That was, that was the most G's I crammed into one meal. And, uh, that one was excellent.
[36:09.580 --> 36:13.340]  And, uh, shout out to Meg Turney for, uh, getting all that.
[36:13.720 --> 36:18.720]  If anything, that's probably worth bonus points because you layered so many G's together.
[36:19.700 --> 36:23.600]  I considered doing an all-pea pizza, but I didn't want to deal with pickles.
[36:23.940 --> 36:25.160]  That was my hindrance.
[36:25.320 --> 36:27.000]  Well, you didn't have to. You could have picked other stuff.
[36:27.260 --> 36:31.520]  No, I would, but I wanted it to be for the thing to work. I needed all the peas on the menu.
[36:31.680 --> 36:34.660]  And that was the one that I was like, eh, I don't know. I don't know about this.
[36:34.720 --> 36:37.040]  Because I could have went peppers, pineapple, pepperoni.
[36:37.400 --> 36:40.080]  They had pine nuts. I wasn't sure where that would fall.
[36:40.740 --> 36:44.480]  Uh, and the pickles was the distractor there. I, I, that's, as you said, Geoff, great,
[36:44.660 --> 36:45.800]  great use of G's, Gavin.
[36:46.180 --> 36:46.820]  Yeah, thanks.
[36:48.000 --> 36:51.000]  Uh, let me see if I can get those, uh, those ones that didn't work real quick.
[36:51.140 --> 36:55.320]  Here we go. Um, it was, it was this one. Oh, it seems to be working.
[36:55.660 --> 36:56.420]  That was the, uh...
[36:56.420 --> 36:57.540]  Okay, ginger shot.
[36:57.800 --> 36:58.520]  The ginger shot.
[36:58.600 --> 37:00.620]  Yeah, that's a beverage. It's a drink. That's not your fun.
[37:01.040 --> 37:05.140]  Okay. And, and it did. No, nevermind. The other one didn't take.
[37:06.400 --> 37:08.700]  Also, in addition, I know we weren't doing drinks,
[37:08.940 --> 37:12.280]  but I exclusively drank grapefruit flavored sparkling water.
[37:13.860 --> 37:16.160]  I like that you didn't actually eat any grapefruit though.
[37:16.160 --> 37:17.520]  You only drank it.
[37:17.600 --> 37:18.260]  I like that.
[37:18.540 --> 37:19.480]  Bubbly. That's good water.
[37:19.800 --> 37:23.800]  Yeah, I like it. And, and that's me. I'm done. I don't remember what the order,
[37:24.040 --> 37:25.400]  but, uh, that was everything I ate.
[37:25.680 --> 37:29.080]  So I'd say, conservatively, Gavin, maybe one and a half strikes.
[37:29.360 --> 37:33.000]  I'm going to go with one. I think, I, I think the sushi.
[37:33.200 --> 37:33.720]  You think one?
[37:34.140 --> 37:35.060]  Yeah, what's the other strike?
[37:35.200 --> 37:35.560]  Goldfish?
[37:35.800 --> 37:37.240]  I'm totally on board with the goldfish.
[37:37.560 --> 37:38.280]  That's totally fine.
[37:38.520 --> 37:41.640]  If we're going to let Greek yogurt go, we gotta let goldfish go.
[37:41.740 --> 37:43.180]  Or garlic bread, because that's bread.
[37:45.340 --> 37:47.580]  No, you ate garlic and Greek and goldfish.
[37:47.920 --> 37:50.480]  And I'm, and you're giving me garden vegetable soup.
[37:50.820 --> 37:52.460]  I mean, it's, yeah.
[37:54.280 --> 37:59.520]  You did so well in other areas. All right. Uh, yeah, I mean, we'll do one and a half strikes.
[37:59.580 --> 38:00.080]  How about that?
[38:00.400 --> 38:04.220]  What about, okay, how about we have our ratings. Eric, how many strikes would you give Gavin?
[38:04.920 --> 38:05.700]  Oh, that's, this is good.
[38:05.940 --> 38:10.540]  I mean, that's, it shouldn't even, I shouldn't probably be involved. I think that
[38:10.540 --> 38:15.960]  the gelato to me is like, that's fine, but then the goldfish aren't.
[38:16.140 --> 38:20.660]  I also don't think progresso soup is a G.
[38:22.640 --> 38:24.280]  The granola is fine.
[38:25.140 --> 38:29.680]  The kind bar, I get, yeah, you could do that because it's a granola bar.
[38:30.060 --> 38:34.260]  The overnight grains, I don't agree with. I don't think overnight grains should count.
[38:34.760 --> 38:35.980]  What is that then? Just parfait?
[38:36.480 --> 38:39.720]  Yeah, or overnight grains, which would be O.
[38:39.720 --> 38:41.100]  But it's grains.
[38:41.380 --> 38:43.060]  Yeah, this is the baked potato.
[38:43.420 --> 38:46.500]  It's baked potato. I think Andrew's sweet potato should be a strike.
[38:47.020 --> 38:49.240]  No, that's a vegetable. It's different to a potato.
[38:49.500 --> 38:50.580]  Vegetable would be B.
[38:51.140 --> 38:54.560]  If we're doing vegetable, P would be potato. Sweet potato would be S.
[38:54.680 --> 38:58.760]  But a sweet potato isn't a potato with sugar on it. It's a different vegetable.
[39:03.560 --> 39:06.020]  So how about, Eric, could you quietly?
[39:06.500 --> 39:12.120]  I think if I was giving Gavin strikes, I think I could settle for two and be comfortable.
[39:12.660 --> 39:14.640]  But if you guys want to go with one and a half, it would be fine.
[39:15.920 --> 39:17.960]  In the background, could you just do your own strikes?
[39:18.060 --> 39:20.380]  And at the end, we could just hear your perspective on where the strikes are.
[39:20.780 --> 39:21.100]  Sure.
[39:23.280 --> 39:27.180]  So now we'll move on to you, Geoff. The floor is yours. I'm so excited for you.
[39:27.200 --> 39:32.940]  Okay, so much like Gavin, I didn't write down what I ate, when I ate it.
[39:32.960 --> 39:34.820]  I just took a picture of everything I ate.
[39:34.820 --> 39:42.780]  And I will say also, not to play the heart strings here for you guys,
[39:42.840 --> 39:47.340]  but I have a very sick dog here, and he had to go to the hospital for 24 hours.
[39:47.480 --> 39:50.540]  And so I didn't eat a lot during this period, because I was running around back and forth,
[39:50.600 --> 39:51.740]  because Henry has pneumonia.
[39:52.860 --> 39:55.140]  He's fine now. He's back home. He's doing better.
[39:55.640 --> 39:57.620]  But it was a stressful like 24 hours for me.
[39:57.680 --> 40:00.300]  And so it was a little hard for me to follow along.
[40:01.020 --> 40:03.000]  It's a good picture of Gavin for some reason.
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.620]  Oh, it went through. That's what the ginger shot did to my face.
[40:06.720 --> 40:09.420]  Sorry to interrupt this nice...
[40:10.480 --> 40:17.300]  So I feel like I was faced with a really difficult letter in you.
[40:17.480 --> 40:18.540]  You absolutely were.
[40:19.020 --> 40:25.320]  It's odd that that was the letter we chose to dissect as a difficult letter
[40:25.320 --> 40:29.140]  in the previous episode, and then suddenly you miraculously pulled it.
[40:29.580 --> 40:30.900]  Uh, but whatever.
[40:31.280 --> 40:32.480]  Uh, not to be deterred.
[40:32.600 --> 40:34.200]  I uh, I did my best.
[40:34.700 --> 40:35.560]  I started out.
[40:35.940 --> 40:37.480]  I ate a lot of these over the week.
[40:37.700 --> 40:38.820]  Uh, I got some Uncrustables.
[40:43.520 --> 40:44.280]  That's uh...
[40:44.280 --> 40:47.780]  It literally says 58 grams of sandwiches.
[40:50.220 --> 40:51.740]  Uh, it's Uncrustables.
[40:51.980 --> 40:52.760]  They start with a U.
[40:53.020 --> 40:54.100]  They have... I got them in peanut butter.
[40:54.220 --> 40:56.720]  I didn't... I got them in grape or sorry, uh, strawberry.
[40:56.920 --> 40:57.880]  I got them in grape as well.
[40:57.920 --> 40:58.960]  I didn't take a photo of the grape.
[40:59.140 --> 41:03.660]  This one might be a little bit more of a stretch, but uh, for a snack along with Uncrustables,
[41:03.940 --> 41:06.560]  I found uh, uh, these things.
[41:06.700 --> 41:07.140]  They're Utz.
[41:07.500 --> 41:11.180]  Eric is not gonna be happy with these.
[41:11.720 --> 41:15.000]  No, it's uh, if I'm losing you here, things are gonna get worse.
[41:15.640 --> 41:19.160]  I was gonna say, I have a feeling it's only just begun.
[41:21.300 --> 41:22.440]  Utz is the brand.
[41:22.720 --> 41:25.420]  Uh, they make Utz balls, I think they're called.
[41:25.540 --> 41:26.640]  So I feel like that counts.
[41:27.040 --> 41:28.220]  Uh, by the way, they're great.
[41:28.220 --> 41:29.960]  My family has fallen in love with Utz.
[41:30.080 --> 41:30.900]  We're gonna eat a lot.
[41:31.600 --> 41:36.080]  Uh, as you know, that Monday night, I had to go out to dinner with my daughter for her 17th birthday.
[41:36.840 --> 41:39.420]  Uh, you, I asked you guys specifically, we were gonna go get sushi.
[41:39.520 --> 41:41.380]  I said, can I go to, can I go to a place called Uchi?
[41:41.460 --> 41:42.180]  Because it starts with a U.
[41:42.360 --> 41:44.120]  And you said, no, you can't go to that restaurant.
[41:44.220 --> 41:44.640]  Doesn't count.
[41:44.880 --> 41:45.580]  So I didn't.
[41:46.060 --> 41:48.460]  I went to the sister restaurant, Uchi Ko.
[41:50.180 --> 41:51.380]  It's a totally different place.
[41:51.720 --> 41:54.960]  Uh, and if I'm being honest with you, and I think Gavin will back this up, I think it's better anyway.
[41:55.180 --> 41:57.980]  Uh, and for proof, for proof, uh, here is,
[41:57.980 --> 42:01.100]  here's a picture Millie took of me walking in the door at Uchi Ko.
[42:01.780 --> 42:03.440]  Uh, I didn't take a-
[42:03.440 --> 42:05.040]  Why do you look blind?
[42:06.120 --> 42:07.640]  I didn't take, I was, I was posing.
[42:08.160 --> 42:12.960]  Uh, I didn't, uh, I didn't take any photos of any of the Uchi Ko stuff I ate inside,
[42:13.060 --> 42:13.920]  but it all started with a U.
[42:14.040 --> 42:19.080]  There was U-steak, there was U-tuna, uh, there's Udomame, uh, it's all-
[42:19.080 --> 42:23.040]  I like that one of Geoff's pictures of what he ate is the picture of a roof of a building.
[42:24.760 --> 42:27.400]  Yeah, uh, then, uh, for breakfast the next morning,
[42:27.400 --> 42:28.180]  breakfast is difficult.
[42:28.460 --> 42:32.440]  Can we put this picture of you going into the restaurant on a shirt?
[42:32.720 --> 42:35.720]  This isn't, this isn't, what an insane picture.
[42:35.780 --> 42:38.180]  Listen, listen, you can put that photo on a shirt
[42:38.180 --> 42:41.480]  right after you put, uh, Bingo can't do it on a shirt.
[42:42.380 --> 42:43.400]  That's gotta come first.
[42:43.520 --> 42:44.440]  You go, we'll talk about that later.
[42:44.440 --> 42:46.800]  I'm pretty sure you're reaching for the wrong side of the door,
[42:46.860 --> 42:48.020]  isn't that a hinge you're reaching for?
[42:48.020 --> 42:50.400]  I wasn't reaching, I, I wasn't reaching for anything,
[42:50.460 --> 42:54.500]  I was, uh, posing, uh, with my hand out to say, like, here is, uh, Uchi Ko.
[42:54.960 --> 42:56.420]  Uh, breakfast was difficult.
[42:56.420 --> 42:58.440]  Well, no, before we move away from the photo,
[42:58.620 --> 43:00.840]  there's a reflection in the door of somebody,
[43:00.940 --> 43:04.340]  a ghostly reflection of someone who seems terrified of what you're doing.
[43:04.360 --> 43:05.960]  Is that a mirror that shows you your future?
[43:07.320 --> 43:09.860]  No, yeah, that's a, no, that's an employee who's wondering
[43:09.860 --> 43:11.960]  why we're taking 45 fucking photos in front of the door.
[43:12.060 --> 43:13.160]  And not just walking in.
[43:13.200 --> 43:17.060]  He looks like a character in the Walking Dead Choose Your Own Adventure game.
[43:18.820 --> 43:19.980]  Like the Telltale game?
[43:20.120 --> 43:20.640]  He does.
[43:24.000 --> 43:25.540]  Uh, okay, so breakfast.
[43:25.980 --> 43:27.940]  Uh, hopefully you guys are with me so far.
[43:28.060 --> 43:29.160]  And I don't have any strikes.
[43:30.780 --> 43:32.220]  Uh, we'll see about this one.
[43:32.600 --> 43:35.300]  Uh, turns out there's something you can eat for breakfast called unicorns.
[43:35.580 --> 43:36.600]  Uh, so I had those.
[43:36.600 --> 43:38.360]  I like your thumb placement.
[43:39.120 --> 43:40.840]  That's a great, the waffles, yeah.
[43:41.020 --> 43:41.920]  Oh, is my thumb covering?
[43:42.300 --> 43:43.760]  I don't know, I don't know that that's the case.
[43:43.900 --> 43:45.200]  It's called Kellogg's Unicorn.
[43:45.240 --> 43:46.620]  You missed the bottom right waffles, by the way.
[43:48.180 --> 43:51.060]  Uh, oh, I'm not sure if that's for this box.
[43:51.220 --> 43:53.200]  Anyway, uh, those, uh, those.
[43:53.200 --> 43:55.400]  Also the per waffle on the bottom left.
[43:56.000 --> 43:57.480]  Those right there, they taste like shit.
[43:57.760 --> 43:58.960]  They're cotton candy flavored.
[43:59.000 --> 43:59.260]  They look terrible.
[43:59.500 --> 44:00.340]  They're fucking disgusting.
[44:00.820 --> 44:02.580]  Uh, I didn't enjoy any of this week, by the way.
[44:02.680 --> 44:03.920]  Everything sucked that I had to eat.
[44:04.320 --> 44:06.340]  Uh, for lunch that day, I believe it was.
[44:06.460 --> 44:08.940]  Uh, I had, uh, keep it with the unicorn theme.
[44:09.300 --> 44:11.000]  I had some unicorn shapes for lunch.
[44:12.540 --> 44:13.560]  They were pretty good.
[44:14.300 --> 44:15.200]  Uh, I'm not gonna lie.
[44:15.340 --> 44:15.840]  They were cheesy.
[44:16.200 --> 44:18.300]  The hand placement is always so good.
[44:19.540 --> 44:22.180]  Those are craft unicorn shapes.
[44:22.180 --> 44:22.800]  They're really good.
[44:22.860 --> 44:23.260]  Look them up.
[44:23.360 --> 44:23.840]  It's a food.
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.240]  Uh, yeah, I cover up the word craft, but it's there.
[44:27.340 --> 44:28.300]  Craft unicorn shapes.
[44:28.640 --> 44:31.440]  Uh, then for dinner that night, I was really proud of this.
[44:31.740 --> 44:32.980]  And I think you guys would be with me here.
[44:33.100 --> 44:35.760]  I ate from a place called, uh, Umami Burger.
[44:36.300 --> 44:37.480]  So I had an umami.
[44:37.560 --> 44:38.880]  You didn't cover burger with your thumb.
[44:40.440 --> 44:41.460]  Well, it's called umami.
[44:41.660 --> 44:42.920]  It says umami in big letters.
[44:43.180 --> 44:43.780]  Hang on.
[44:44.400 --> 44:46.840]  What did you get from umami burger?
[44:47.140 --> 44:48.400]  I got an umami burger.
[44:50.740 --> 44:51.460]  That's what it's called.
[44:51.460 --> 44:52.100]  Number one.
[44:53.520 --> 44:53.900]  Yeah.
[44:54.580 --> 45:00.580]  And, and, uh, and then I, the next day, uh, uh, I had, uh, for a snack.
[45:00.620 --> 45:02.980]  I had, uh, I might be losing you a little bit on this one.
[45:03.040 --> 45:04.040]  Uh, I had an urido.
[45:04.180 --> 45:08.160]  If we don't see some udon noodles or actually something with a wiggle.
[45:09.680 --> 45:11.060]  That's what I think is impressive.
[45:11.280 --> 45:13.240]  I don't think you have a single nut strike.
[45:13.360 --> 45:15.340]  I think these are all the right strikes.
[45:15.680 --> 45:16.560]  For lunch today.
[45:16.660 --> 45:20.820]  I had an, uh, I haven't, I haven't seen the bee through the paper.
[45:25.020 --> 45:27.500]  Um, well that, that, that picture was too big.
[45:27.600 --> 45:32.040]  So I'll have to, I'll have to skip to, uh, let's see.
[45:32.160 --> 45:32.660]  Oh man.
[45:32.820 --> 45:34.840]  Oh, I like how some of them don't work on discord.
[45:35.420 --> 45:36.600]  Uh, I know it makes no sense.
[45:36.640 --> 45:36.800]  Right.
[45:37.160 --> 45:39.820]  I had, uh, for a snack.
[45:39.920 --> 45:41.300]  I had uddy uddies.
[45:42.460 --> 45:43.360]  Those are really good.
[45:43.420 --> 45:43.960]  If you ever have them.
[45:44.400 --> 45:45.220]  They're chocolatey.
[45:45.840 --> 45:46.520]  Uddy uddies.
[45:47.220 --> 45:48.560]  Um, oh, I had some.
[45:48.560 --> 45:51.020]  You were presenting this up front.
[45:51.140 --> 45:53.980]  You were presenting this like you may have taken some slight liberty.
[45:55.180 --> 45:56.480]  I hate, I think I like this.
[45:56.540 --> 45:58.140]  I had some, I had some ushers.
[45:58.820 --> 46:00.220]  Uh, which was very good.
[46:02.840 --> 46:03.820]  You can see right there.
[46:03.900 --> 46:07.280]  It says ute ushers is what those are called.
[46:07.880 --> 46:10.500]  Uh, I also had, uh, this stuff is great.
[46:10.520 --> 46:13.200]  If you ever, uh, oh shit, this is too big too.
[46:13.600 --> 46:14.600]  What a piss take.
[46:14.860 --> 46:15.380]  Uh, hold on.
[46:15.400 --> 46:17.640]  Let me, let me do something with these real fast.
[46:17.640 --> 46:18.680]  These are too good to miss.
[46:18.940 --> 46:21.980]  Um, yeah, I had to take screenshots of my pictures to make this one.
[46:22.240 --> 46:24.320]  This was your game.
[46:24.540 --> 46:25.940]  This was your game.
[46:26.140 --> 46:28.320]  And you're showing us ute ushers.
[46:28.600 --> 46:29.820]  Like what?
[46:30.040 --> 46:32.860]  I think it's pronounced ute ushers, not ute ushers.
[46:33.340 --> 46:34.040]  But I don't know.
[46:34.100 --> 46:37.460]  I'm not, I'm not entirely, uh, sure about that.
[46:37.540 --> 46:38.180]  And then what was it?
[46:38.220 --> 46:39.340]  Oh, yeah, here we go.
[46:39.420 --> 46:41.060]  Let me take a screenshot of this guy too.
[46:42.400 --> 46:45.740]  Uh, I think, I think if you're with me so far, I think we're fine.
[46:46.180 --> 46:47.100]  And it sounds like you guys.
[46:47.100 --> 46:48.160]  I don't think anyone's with you.
[46:48.200 --> 46:51.560]  And I don't think there's been any implication that we are even slightly with you.
[46:51.840 --> 46:53.020]  So you guys are with me.
[46:53.060 --> 46:53.360]  Got it.
[46:53.540 --> 46:53.860]  Okay.
[46:53.940 --> 46:56.420]  So we'll do, uh, let's see where we go.
[46:57.180 --> 47:01.140]  Oh, yeah, this is an, I had an, this was not very good.
[47:01.220 --> 47:01.980]  I had an ute usht.
[47:02.980 --> 47:07.820]  It's sort of a, it's like a baked dish, a cylindrical baked dish.
[47:07.900 --> 47:08.920]  It's called a ute usht.
[47:09.320 --> 47:10.520]  You can see it right there on the box.
[47:10.640 --> 47:12.540]  It's Sam's, Sam's choice, ute usht.
[47:12.680 --> 47:13.340]  I got that at Walmart.
[47:13.460 --> 47:14.560]  Now you're in Andrew's territory.
[47:14.560 --> 47:19.020]  This is, uh, then I got, uh, oh, I like this one.
[47:19.100 --> 47:20.100]  I think you'll like this one.
[47:20.120 --> 47:21.180]  Uh, put some effort into this one.
[47:21.360 --> 47:23.480]  I ate some, uh, how is that too big?
[47:23.520 --> 47:25.060]  I just fucking screenshot of that.
[47:25.240 --> 47:26.720]  You gotta be, suck my butthole.
[47:27.220 --> 47:28.180]  Uh, let me try again.
[47:28.520 --> 47:29.260]  Uh, all right, here we go.
[47:29.300 --> 47:29.440]  All right.
[47:29.460 --> 47:30.760]  There's no point in counting strikes, Eric.
[47:30.980 --> 47:33.800]  He is, we're in a different inning based off of Geoff's photos.
[47:34.020 --> 47:36.940]  I ate some, that's unchin unch.
[47:37.440 --> 47:40.280]  Uh, it's like a, it's like a, unchin unch.
[47:40.380 --> 47:41.180]  It's like a snack.
[47:41.560 --> 47:42.740]  It's like a snack meal.
[47:43.040 --> 47:43.960]  Uh, it's pretty good.
[47:43.960 --> 47:47.840]  I have never seen, it's hard to tell how mad I am because it's so funny.
[47:47.900 --> 47:48.620]  It's hard to tell.
[47:48.780 --> 47:51.820]  I've never seen anyone try so hard yet not try at all.
[47:52.100 --> 47:53.040]  I had some unchos.
[47:53.600 --> 47:54.640]  These are pretty good.
[47:54.720 --> 47:55.920]  It's like a potato-y.
[47:56.120 --> 47:57.040]  Unchos, they're crispy.
[47:57.680 --> 48:00.200]  Uh, I got those from Walmart as well.
[48:00.280 --> 48:00.980]  Uh, and then what else?
[48:00.980 --> 48:05.200]  I like that you put the, you scribbled out the, the brand name and not potato crisps.
[48:06.460 --> 48:07.780]  Unchos is what they're called.
[48:08.140 --> 48:09.620]  Uh, oh, I had this today.
[48:09.800 --> 48:10.740]  I had one of these today.
[48:10.800 --> 48:11.740]  It's called an upcake.
[48:12.140 --> 48:13.780]  Uh, they're like little footballs on them.
[48:14.400 --> 48:15.560]  Uh, those are good.
[48:15.740 --> 48:22.120]  You didn't, you, you went from order, as long as there was a you somewhere in the food,
[48:22.180 --> 48:25.360]  even if it's not in the food and only in the brand name, it was good enough for you.
[48:25.460 --> 48:28.300]  And then the last thing I had, now this one might be a stretch.
[48:28.720 --> 48:30.120]  Uh, I apologize for this one.
[48:30.260 --> 48:31.600]  I was losing some steam at the end.
[48:31.700 --> 48:36.580]  I had what I like to call an upside down burger, which you might call a Big Mac,
[48:36.660 --> 48:39.500]  but if it's upside down, I assumed that it, it would count.
[48:39.500 --> 48:41.820]  So I, I'll take a strike on that one because I feel like that's a little,
[48:41.900 --> 48:44.360]  that's a bridge too far, but I feel pretty good about the other.
[48:44.360 --> 48:48.300]  Hey, can I ask why you didn't just do that with all your fucking foods, dude?
[48:48.900 --> 48:50.960]  Because I, I thought of it today.
[48:55.640 --> 48:57.120]  So anyway, I did my best.
[48:57.940 --> 48:59.160]  Uh, I did my best.
[48:59.580 --> 49:03.040]  It was, uh, it was a hard, hard to use.
[49:03.880 --> 49:08.760]  Here's what you should do between, uh, Monday of next week and the next recording.
[49:09.420 --> 49:09.740]  Uh-huh.
[49:09.740 --> 49:11.860]  You should, uh, you should do the challenge.
[49:12.060 --> 49:12.720]  Yeah, just one.
[49:12.980 --> 49:14.120]  Just not even the challenge.
[49:14.360 --> 49:15.760]  Just eat one new food.
[49:16.320 --> 49:16.700]  Just one.
[49:17.360 --> 49:17.720]  Uncrustables!
[49:18.080 --> 49:18.800]  I ate Uncrustables.
[49:18.820 --> 49:19.460]  That's the same.
[49:19.560 --> 49:20.260]  It doesn't count.
[49:20.540 --> 49:20.900]  Umami!
[49:21.040 --> 49:21.680]  I had umami.
[49:22.480 --> 49:24.800]  Oh, I had udon when I was at Uchiko.
[49:25.020 --> 49:25.560]  That counts.
[49:25.840 --> 49:27.180]  You thought you'd take a picture of that?
[49:27.180 --> 49:29.060]  You didn't even show us that!
[49:29.140 --> 49:30.520]  That was, that didn't make the cut.
[49:30.820 --> 49:33.040]  I didn't take any pictures of the inside Uchiko.
[49:33.640 --> 49:34.460]  What do you mean?
[49:34.600 --> 49:34.980]  I don't know.
[49:35.000 --> 49:35.600]  I just didn't think to.
[49:35.860 --> 49:37.220]  It was like a fancy birthday dinner.
[49:37.340 --> 49:39.660]  I don't want to be like taking photos of food in the dark.
[49:39.660 --> 49:41.860]  But you didn't even tell us that you ate it.
[49:41.920 --> 49:42.340]  You didn't mention it.
[49:42.340 --> 49:43.680]  I forgot about it until just now.
[49:43.800 --> 49:45.620]  It's the only genuine you you've had.
[49:46.400 --> 49:48.160]  I think everything I showed you was a you.
[49:48.820 --> 49:51.340]  Even when I yelled out, I'd be pissed if there's no udon.
[49:51.540 --> 49:51.840]  Look, look, look.
[49:51.960 --> 49:57.680]  I get, I get, I get that, uh, that the upside down burger is probably not right.
[49:57.780 --> 49:58.720]  I'll take a strike on that.
[49:59.560 --> 50:00.360]  But ushers,
[50:00.600 --> 50:01.820]  Okay, so one strike.
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.020]  Udy Udy, Unchin Unch, Umami.
[50:04.620 --> 50:05.300]  I stopped counting.
[50:05.560 --> 50:08.020]  I got to like seven and I just went, that's enough.
[50:08.020 --> 50:09.860]  I'm just going to start counting real foods.
[50:10.900 --> 50:12.880]  Unchos, up cakes.
[50:13.280 --> 50:14.340]  I don't know what to tell you.
[50:15.000 --> 50:16.140]  I don't know what to tell you.
[50:16.360 --> 50:17.260]  Yeah, I know this.
[50:17.480 --> 50:20.420]  I don't, I don't feel like you did, but you did something.
[50:20.900 --> 50:22.680]  I don't know what you did, but you did.
[50:22.720 --> 50:23.840]  It took the most pictures.
[50:24.340 --> 50:24.700]  Thank you.
[50:24.740 --> 50:24.920]  Thanks.
[50:25.460 --> 50:26.680]  I also put a lot of work in.
[50:26.760 --> 50:27.680]  I painted shit.
[50:28.840 --> 50:33.020]  I had to go buy red paint at the store to paint those bags.
[50:34.360 --> 50:35.940]  Why didn't you just use red ushers?
[50:37.320 --> 50:38.460]  I didn't think to.
[50:41.440 --> 50:46.680]  Anyway, so I don't know how to determine who won, but I guess it sounds like I might have
[50:46.680 --> 50:47.520]  more than one strike.
[50:47.760 --> 50:49.820]  And so Andrew had one Gavin that one.
[50:49.920 --> 50:51.220]  And I guess, Andrew, you win.
[50:51.440 --> 50:52.460]  Yeah, I think Andrew wins.
[50:52.640 --> 50:52.800]  I guess.
[50:53.180 --> 50:53.580]  Thanks.
[50:54.820 --> 50:56.000]  It doesn't feel great with it.
[50:56.420 --> 50:57.940]  Equal amount of effort across the board.
[50:58.020 --> 50:58.540]  Andrew wins.
[50:58.860 --> 51:01.320]  I wish we did you like first.
[51:01.440 --> 51:03.860]  That really, that was deflating in a weird way.
[51:04.660 --> 51:05.080]  I don't know.
[51:05.080 --> 51:05.860]  That was the best.
[51:06.260 --> 51:09.800]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was the order that I'm pretty sure that was the order that needed
[51:09.800 --> 51:10.340]  to go in.
[51:12.500 --> 51:13.600]  Well, should I?
[51:13.820 --> 51:16.080]  Eric, should I get into what I was going to 100%?
[51:16.180 --> 51:17.000]  Yeah, no, no.
[51:17.060 --> 51:17.720]  Do we have time?
[51:18.040 --> 51:19.940]  Yes, we'll go long if we have to.
[51:20.340 --> 51:20.600]  Geoff.
[51:20.820 --> 51:25.420]  Geoff confided in me earlier this week and brought it here that he thinks that he's been
[51:25.420 --> 51:26.020]  fucked with.
[51:26.680 --> 51:35.060]  Andrew brought his video or photo evidence that he pulled the numbers legally to me.
[51:35.060 --> 51:37.360]  And I don't even know what to tell you.
[51:37.480 --> 51:39.780]  So let me let me start.
[51:40.100 --> 51:41.220]  This has to go to very specific.
[51:41.460 --> 51:42.440]  This better not be recorded.
[51:43.860 --> 51:44.740]  I recorded.
[51:44.960 --> 51:45.900]  It's not fixed.
[51:46.420 --> 51:49.620]  I recorded the numbers being pulled for all of us.
[51:50.500 --> 51:55.340]  And that evening, Gavin and I were talking and I said, what do you think the odds?
[51:55.440 --> 51:56.460]  Because it was ridiculous.
[51:56.520 --> 51:57.140]  The ones we pulled.
[51:57.280 --> 52:02.780]  I said, what percentage of the audience do you think will think that I have somehow rigged
[52:02.780 --> 52:04.960]  this so that I have the easiest letter?
[52:05.680 --> 52:09.980]  And I don't remember what you said at that time, but you brought up you did record it.
[52:10.080 --> 52:11.220]  So you have proof.
[52:11.420 --> 52:12.240]  So it's fine.
[52:12.300 --> 52:13.040]  It doesn't really matter.
[52:13.120 --> 52:14.200]  And I was like, yeah, you know, you're right.
[52:14.460 --> 52:15.180]  We're all good.
[52:16.560 --> 52:19.220]  Few hours later, I watched the video.
[52:19.920 --> 52:24.600]  Oh, and I feel like I'm just need to prepare to be annoyed.
[52:24.920 --> 52:25.360]  There we go.
[52:25.600 --> 52:25.800]  Good.
[52:26.240 --> 52:30.580]  I watched the video and I realized I realized I was in deep trouble.
[52:31.040 --> 52:32.200]  I've got a real issue in my head.
[52:33.420 --> 52:36.320]  Geoff is maybe the worst photo taker in the world.
[52:36.980 --> 52:40.280]  I think I might be the worst video taker of all time.
[52:40.460 --> 52:42.380]  This is maybe beyond Geoff.
[52:42.420 --> 52:43.100]  I'm going to put it.
[52:43.240 --> 52:44.860]  Why am I catching heat all of a sudden?
[52:44.960 --> 52:47.720]  Because no, you're known for your bad photos.
[52:47.860 --> 52:49.680]  Don't you know?
[52:49.760 --> 52:51.340]  I mean, look at that picture of the upside down burger.
[52:51.440 --> 52:52.880]  It looks like it was taken in the dark.
[52:53.380 --> 52:57.720]  I'm just equating it to let me make sure I get the right thing.
[52:57.900 --> 53:00.740]  So I saw this and I thought, oh God.
[53:01.300 --> 53:08.040]  So I organized a special little recording with Eric and Nick on Monday to show them
[53:08.040 --> 53:10.500]  the proof that I have and to go over.
[53:10.580 --> 53:12.760]  I think that will go out at some point soon.
[53:13.580 --> 53:15.200]  I'm not sure when exactly.
[53:15.440 --> 53:16.480]  So you presented evidence?
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.820]  I presented the video evidence that I have.
[53:21.140 --> 53:22.000]  How do I?
[53:22.160 --> 53:23.100]  How do I see this?
[53:23.560 --> 53:25.280]  I'm going to put it in the slack.
[53:25.360 --> 53:26.340]  I'm just trying to find it.
[53:27.400 --> 53:28.200]  Share message.
[53:29.200 --> 53:29.900]  How do I?
[53:29.940 --> 53:30.720]  How do I do this?
[53:32.380 --> 53:33.300]  Ah, my thumb.
[53:34.260 --> 53:36.200]  This is something that could be edited out.
[53:36.700 --> 53:37.100]  No.
[53:37.580 --> 53:38.440]  I should have prepped this.
[53:40.120 --> 53:41.100]  This is on me.
[53:41.640 --> 53:43.480]  Yeah, I think Nick, please leave this part in.
[53:43.560 --> 53:43.600]  No!
[53:47.800 --> 53:48.200]  Okay.
[53:49.460 --> 53:50.460]  I think this is it.
[53:51.040 --> 53:51.680]  This it?
[53:52.580 --> 53:53.500]  I think this is it.
[53:53.500 --> 53:54.180]  We're going to send this.
[53:54.260 --> 53:55.080]  We're going to hope that this is it.
[53:55.260 --> 53:56.240]  So it's in the face thing.
[53:56.320 --> 53:57.420]  It's uploading right now.
[53:58.140 --> 54:00.500]  It is the video of me drawing the ball.
[54:01.120 --> 54:01.480]  Okay.
[54:01.940 --> 54:03.460]  I'm still waiting for it to come through.
[54:03.660 --> 54:04.960]  It's loading. It's more than halfway.
[54:06.260 --> 54:07.780]  But Gavin, you were right.
[54:08.600 --> 54:09.480]  Prepare to be annoyed.
[54:10.540 --> 54:12.540]  Oh, okay. I'm going to hit play. Is that right?
[54:12.740 --> 54:13.300]  This is... yeah, go ahead.
[54:13.640 --> 54:14.760]  Three, two, one, play.
[54:14.880 --> 54:17.040]  This is the only video proof I have of the draw.
[54:19.740 --> 54:20.680]  721 are in.
[54:21.140 --> 54:22.000]  So those are the numbers then?
[54:25.830 --> 54:27.570]  There's a finger in the top of the screen.
[54:27.650 --> 54:28.870]  Yep, finger in frame.
[54:36.310 --> 54:36.910]  Drops out.
[54:37.130 --> 54:38.510]  Rolls onto the floor.
[54:40.390 --> 54:41.710]  And it stops there?
[54:42.110 --> 54:43.570]  Well, I didn't... I didn't...
[54:43.570 --> 54:44.250]  So this is...
[54:44.670 --> 54:47.830]  So you didn't show the first two numbers be pulled.
[54:48.090 --> 54:48.950]  Well, I think there's a different...
[54:48.950 --> 54:50.830]  And you didn't show the third number...
[54:51.030 --> 54:56.850]  What is interesting is that you're not even filming the top of the ramp or the ball spinning.
[54:57.070 --> 54:59.750]  You could have just dropped it in with your hand.
[54:59.910 --> 55:01.850]  Well, one would assume his hand...
[55:01.850 --> 55:05.370]  His right hand is right above his thumb that you can see in the video.
[55:05.370 --> 55:08.070]  And he just drops the ball into the plastic thing.
[55:08.450 --> 55:10.590]  I'm gonna... I've gone frame by frame over this video.
[55:10.850 --> 55:13.650]  This is the best angle of the ball I have in the video.
[55:14.070 --> 55:17.370]  This is the best shot that we get of it going down the chute.
[55:17.610 --> 55:20.170]  I think you could see a 16 if you know what it is.
[55:20.230 --> 55:21.750]  By the way, it looks like an 18 to me.
[55:22.070 --> 55:23.430]  That's what we're printing on the vinyl.
[55:27.650 --> 55:28.950]  The episode 16.
[55:30.810 --> 55:32.130]  This is all them in their hole.
[55:33.310 --> 55:35.010]  Andrew... Andrew had...
[55:36.290 --> 55:40.910]  I think that they bring up a great point of you're shooting at such a weird angle.
[55:41.450 --> 55:44.550]  If you can't see where the numbers are, you can't see where the ball comes out,
[55:44.650 --> 55:45.690]  you only see this ramp.
[55:45.830 --> 55:46.650]  Why is that?
[55:46.790 --> 55:47.870]  Yeah, I was about to get into that.
[55:47.950 --> 55:54.190]  So the reason why we have the angle that we do is because I was recording in my underwear
[55:54.190 --> 55:55.650]  and it was reflective.
[55:55.910 --> 56:01.170]  Everything on the bingo machine is reflective and I didn't want to be in the machine.
[56:01.170 --> 56:08.130]  So I'm actually standing in my bathroom filming the least reflective area of it
[56:08.130 --> 56:11.050]  and I wasn't looking at what I was filming.
[56:11.270 --> 56:13.630]  I was looking at the machine the entire time.
[56:13.790 --> 56:18.990]  I didn't actually know what I had filmed until that evening, but I recognize it looks terrible.
[56:19.610 --> 56:22.430]  That made more sense to you than putting shorts on.
[56:22.730 --> 56:24.690]  Well, I didn't know where the shorts were. The show is ongoing.
[56:24.830 --> 56:27.090]  I don't want to put a pause to any of the action that's happening.
[56:27.350 --> 56:29.870]  I mean, it took you 45 minutes to show us the video.
[56:29.870 --> 56:32.310]  You could have put on 18 pairs of shorts in that time.
[56:32.450 --> 56:35.930]  Well, I didn't plan on it. It's fair. It's a fair point. I didn't plan on it in that moment.
[56:36.630 --> 56:38.830]  It was a mistake. The ball didn't catch.
[56:38.970 --> 56:43.490]  I asked several people. Didn't get many 16s.
[56:43.650 --> 56:47.510]  So I took to Twitter. I posted that photo you saw.
[56:48.110 --> 56:50.510]  And I asked, what number do people see?
[56:52.550 --> 56:57.470]  Almost unanimously, by a large majority, most people see 18.
[56:57.470 --> 57:01.130]  There were 11 16s, though.
[57:01.750 --> 57:03.910]  So there were some people that did see the 16.
[57:04.250 --> 57:05.890]  So I feel like that needs to go in.
[57:07.910 --> 57:09.950]  Most definitely see 18. And I can see that.
[57:09.990 --> 57:13.410]  But if you look at the still photo of all three of them in their placement,
[57:14.230 --> 57:16.850]  the 16 has a real hook on it. It's really curved.
[57:17.410 --> 57:21.550]  So it makes sense that in the movement, the spin, the motion effect,
[57:22.310 --> 57:24.850]  would make it appear to be an 18 when it isn't.
[57:24.910 --> 57:27.290]  I've been running this back and forth. I've been analyzing frame by frame.
[57:27.470 --> 57:31.910]  I do believe that is the 16, you know, just based on the motion blur pattern, as you were saying.
[57:32.650 --> 57:36.910]  It still doesn't prove that you didn't just drop it further up the machine, though.
[57:38.150 --> 57:45.410]  Yeah, if anything, your video evidence has weakened the case to me that this was legitimate.
[57:46.870 --> 57:52.930]  Because you released a video that doesn't show any of the balls legitimately being pulled.
[57:54.650 --> 57:55.870]  I don't know what you mean by that.
[57:55.990 --> 57:56.550]  What do you mean?
[57:56.550 --> 57:58.330]  You can't see them go through the machine.
[57:58.470 --> 58:00.850]  We just see them show up on a little plastic tray.
[58:01.250 --> 58:03.970]  For all I know, your mom is dropping them down the other side.
[58:04.390 --> 58:07.870]  First of all, that's impossible for how the machine is designed.
[58:08.070 --> 58:09.130]  I'll take a photo of the machine.
[58:09.230 --> 58:11.130]  Nobody knows because we can't see the machine.
[58:11.310 --> 58:13.690]  Second of all, this is the first thing I'm going to say.
[58:14.010 --> 58:15.770]  Nobody asked me to bring this forward.
[58:16.130 --> 58:18.310]  I am the one who brought all of this to light.
[58:18.570 --> 58:21.090]  I was about to request this, by the way, this very episode.
[58:22.350 --> 58:24.390]  Well, you didn't. I came first with it.
[58:24.550 --> 58:24.570]  Right.
[58:24.570 --> 58:26.450]  That may be true. I believe you in that.
[58:26.510 --> 58:32.030]  But I feel like I get points for stepping forward with this without anyone demanding the proof.
[58:32.770 --> 58:35.910]  And coming from a position of, I know this looks horrendous.
[58:36.150 --> 58:38.350]  You get 16 points for coming forward.
[58:38.470 --> 58:41.230]  However, you lose 36 points for the poor filming.
[58:41.610 --> 58:45.770]  What's impressive with negative 20 points is that's only half the amount of strikes that you have.
[58:46.010 --> 58:47.550]  And on the grand scheme of things...
[58:47.550 --> 58:50.410]  Look, man, I knew going into it, I was getting strikes.
[58:51.290 --> 58:52.570]  Yeah, you had a brutal...
[58:53.150 --> 58:54.290]  That's what made it worse.
[58:54.710 --> 58:57.710]  As you said, they were very suspicious letters.
[58:58.210 --> 59:00.450]  Everybody sort of had some connection to the letter.
[59:00.670 --> 59:01.870]  It made it feel fake.
[59:02.090 --> 59:06.950]  When Eric told me that you thought that this is all an elaborate prank against you.
[59:07.370 --> 59:08.890]  I'm like, I thought I was dead.
[59:09.290 --> 59:13.850]  I assumed I was dead going into this with the reveal of what my proof is.
[59:14.790 --> 59:16.770]  I still think it was an elaborate prank against me.
[59:17.430 --> 59:18.750]  You still, even after all this?
[59:19.030 --> 59:19.330]  Yeah.
[59:19.950 --> 59:21.330]  I mean, the more so because of this.
[59:21.330 --> 59:22.050]  Even after all what?
[59:22.910 --> 59:23.350]  Huh?
[59:23.850 --> 59:29.570]  You said even after all this, what has occurred here that would change Geoff's mind at all?
[59:30.050 --> 59:33.690]  You filmed a bingo machine from another room.
[59:34.030 --> 59:34.970]  Yeah, well, I...
[59:34.970 --> 59:36.310]  He didn't film the bingo machine.
[59:36.470 --> 59:38.510]  He filmed the tray under the bingo machine.
[59:38.790 --> 59:41.310]  So why didn't you stand to the right and hold your phone out?
[59:41.470 --> 59:43.470]  What was the big fear about the reflection?
[59:45.190 --> 59:46.490]  Because I was a minor one.
[59:46.670 --> 59:48.370]  No, I mean, stand out of the way of the reflection.
[59:49.050 --> 59:49.930]  Use your arms.
[59:49.930 --> 59:50.350]  I was.
[59:50.470 --> 59:51.350]  That's what I did.
[59:51.850 --> 59:53.190]  What are you talking about?
[59:53.230 --> 59:54.230]  That's what the video is.
[59:54.330 --> 59:55.550]  That's exactly what he did, Gavin.
[59:55.550 --> 59:56.330]  That's what happened.
[59:56.570 --> 59:59.270]  In the process of doing it, he was so focused on the machine,
[59:59.390 --> 01:00:01.630]  he didn't pay attention to what he was looking at.
[01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:01.910]  Filming.
[01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:05.390]  I was looking at the machine the whole time, not the phone displaying the video.
[01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:07.230]  But I just don't understand why you had to be in the bathroom.
[01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:09.570]  Because I...
[01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:10.850]  Reflective, because it's a dome.
[01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:12.970]  It's a plastic dome that everything messes up.
[01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.490]  It's weird.
[01:00:13.590 --> 01:00:15.990]  We didn't see a dome in a single frame of this freaking thing.
[01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:18.010]  That's because...
[01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:21.190]  I'm saying, you being in the bathroom is completely irrelevant.
[01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:22.630]  You're...
[01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:25.990]  You're right, but me being in the bathroom would allow me to film the dome,
[01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:27.910]  but I didn't know I wasn't filming the dome.
[01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:31.390]  You're saying being in the bathroom would have allowed you to film it correctly,
[01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:32.530]  and then you didn't anyway.
[01:00:33.090 --> 01:00:35.050]  Yeah, because I'm a terrible at filming videos.
[01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.950]  That's how this started.
[01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:37.050]  I'm the Geoff of videos.
[01:00:37.570 --> 01:00:38.730]  I didn't realize my fingers...
[01:00:38.730 --> 01:00:39.210]  Stop attacking me!
[01:00:39.350 --> 01:00:41.130]  My fingers in the frame of the video.
[01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:42.770]  There's a lot of issues.
[01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:45.150]  I clearly wasn't seeing what was happening.
[01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:49.610]  I just don't know how you tried so legitimately to do it right,
[01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:54.250]  but I have no other recourse but to ask you to use your get out of Greg...
[01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:55.750]  I'm not using it.
[01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:56.130]  You're insane.
[01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:56.870]  I'm not using it.
[01:00:57.010 --> 01:00:57.390]  This is...
[01:00:57.390 --> 01:00:57.530]  No.
[01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:58.550]  Andrew, this is insane.
[01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:00.320]  Even when you presented it to me and Nick...
[01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:02.570]  Mr. Judge over here all of a sudden,
[01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:04.950]  10 minutes ago, I don't want to be involved.
[01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:06.410]  I don't want to give an opinion.
[01:01:06.810 --> 01:01:07.970]  Now you're laying down the law.
[01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:09.410]  What are you talking about?
[01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:11.750]  I think this is crazy.
[01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:13.570]  I think this is crazy.
[01:01:15.290 --> 01:01:16.110]  I agree.
[01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:18.130]  I agree with that,
[01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:19.730]  but I don't agree with the other thing.
[01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:22.790]  You know, I think...
[01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:27.170]  I think I believe Andrew.
[01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:29.990]  I definitely salad creamed it 100%.
[01:01:30.570 --> 01:01:32.350]  I wish you could know the fear.
[01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:34.110]  I wanted to record then.
[01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:36.870]  I was mad that I didn't look at the video before.
[01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:38.270]  I was like, I'm fucked.
[01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:39.970]  There's nothing I could do.
[01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:40.990]  This is terrible.
[01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:45.130]  I think the first person I showed the photo to said,
[01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:46.010]  what number do you see?
[01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:47.150]  They said like 56.
[01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:48.750]  And I just said, I'm fucked.
[01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:50.810]  There's oh, I'm in trouble.
[01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:54.290]  500 replies to what number this is.
[01:01:54.570 --> 01:01:57.890]  9 of them see 11 or 6, 16.
[01:01:58.610 --> 01:01:59.110]  I'm mad.
[01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:00.410]  I'm not even saying the right numbers.
[01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:01.530]  So blurry.
[01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:03.070]  It's so blurry.
[01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:04.470]  And I went frame by frame.
[01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:08.790]  The issue is that not only did it bounce out of the shoot,
[01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:11.870]  it bounced while facing the machine the entire time.
[01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:13.370]  The number is never seen.
[01:02:13.810 --> 01:02:17.610]  Otherwise, I was trying to look at it in the reflection of the black thing.
[01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:18.450]  Yeah, it's tough.
[01:02:18.590 --> 01:02:19.490]  It's not even in there.
[01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:20.370]  It's not there.
[01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:22.090]  I checked frame by frame.
[01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:24.910]  So this is what I was going to do.
[01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:26.210]  This is these are my offers.
[01:02:26.330 --> 01:02:27.310]  I'm either willing.
[01:02:27.590 --> 01:02:28.790]  I'm willing to do this again.
[01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:30.110]  Do a redraw.
[01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:36.030]  I'm willing to take this as an R and do it again with R because most people see it as 18.
[01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:38.990]  Or if you believe me, we can just move on.
[01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:41.250]  Any of those options I think are fair.
[01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:43.330]  It was my job to capture the proof.
[01:02:43.490 --> 01:02:45.650]  I delivered insufficient evidence.
[01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:47.430]  There's room for speculation.
[01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:48.630]  I own that.
[01:02:50.170 --> 01:02:53.890]  Is there a fourth option where I don't believe you and we still move on?
[01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:57.130]  I mean, if you want to, sure.
[01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:01.370]  Yeah, I'm happy with that one too.
[01:03:02.050 --> 01:03:03.130]  You don't believe me?
[01:03:03.330 --> 01:03:04.470]  No, I believe you.
[01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:05.450]  I believe you.
[01:03:06.290 --> 01:03:11.230]  Oh man, I think I believe you, but it's just so hard.
[01:03:11.850 --> 01:03:12.650]  I, yeah.
[01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:14.710]  You're such a trickster.
[01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:15.550]  You're so wily.
[01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:18.550]  So here, I just took a photo of the machine.
[01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:22.090]  You see, I couldn't rig it because it's a plastic top over the hole.
[01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:23.330]  So you can't just drop it in.
[01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:25.430]  Yeah, but I can't see your legs.
[01:03:25.790 --> 01:03:27.270]  I don't see you at all in this.
[01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:29.070]  Like, I'm not crazy.
[01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:30.530]  Like, Nick, do you see him?
[01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:32.270]  Nick, can you like, please try to make him look?
[01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:33.750]  This is a different angle.
[01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:35.110]  I can definitely see him.
[01:03:35.310 --> 01:03:36.870]  Okay, this is a different angle.
[01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:38.550]  This is the angle, Andrew.
[01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:39.490]  No, it's not.
[01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:40.590]  No, it's not.
[01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:44.550]  Every photo you submit is worse than the last, Andrew.
[01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:46.330]  You should not have sent this photo.
[01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:47.470]  No, listen to me.
[01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:49.310]  You fucking idiot, Gavin.
[01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:51.950]  How am I turning the machine on?
[01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:53.450]  How am I doing it from this angle?
[01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:54.670]  How's that gonna work?
[01:03:55.070 --> 01:03:56.090]  How am I gonna activate it?
[01:03:56.110 --> 01:03:58.210]  You said you just have to hit a button and then watch what happens.
[01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:00.250]  Yeah, on the other side of the machine.
[01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:01.910]  I don't have ten foot on.
[01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:04.130]  Oh, so I'm just gonna hit it?
[01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:04.930]  I'm gonna walk?
[01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:05.510]  You want me to walk?
[01:04:05.570 --> 01:04:07.610]  It'll look like the fucking Blair Witch Project.
[01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:11.970]  You're better than the freaking blurry 56 that you gave us.
[01:04:12.070 --> 01:04:16.790]  I'm saying if you think the blurry thing is bad, that was me standing kind of prepared.
[01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:18.210]  You want to put movement?
[01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:20.430]  You want to add actual movement to this?
[01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:21.870]  Turn a freaking light on.
[01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:22.810]  It won't be so blurry.
[01:04:23.290 --> 01:04:24.070]  It's pretty bright in here.
[01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:25.510]  I actually don't think I need the light.
[01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:29.810]  I know the blinds don't do much.
[01:04:29.810 --> 01:04:32.510]  I'd like for you to take an immaculate picture of the machine without...
[01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:34.030]  I can barely even see your hand.
[01:04:34.690 --> 01:04:36.550]  Yeah, there's the... it's fucking zero reflection.
[01:04:36.550 --> 01:04:37.630]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:39.530]  With the cover, you're like, you just dropped the ball.
[01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:43.010]  You can't. It goes in the hole on the right, and it's a secure plastic box.
[01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:44.810]  Then it rolls down the chute.
[01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:47.270]  It rolls right towards you.
[01:04:47.330 --> 01:04:49.550]  What are you talking about? It's on the other side of the fucking...
[01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:49.850]  No!
[01:04:51.290 --> 01:04:51.650]  You're...
[01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:54.170]  The ramp is coming to where you're stood in that picture.
[01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:56.490]  I'm going to... what do you mean, where I'm stood?
[01:04:58.530 --> 01:05:01.730]  I'm saying you could have hit the button, nipped to this position,
[01:05:01.890 --> 01:05:03.290]  and the ball would have rolled towards you.
[01:05:03.290 --> 01:05:05.650]  I'm sending you another photo right now of where I'm...
[01:05:05.650 --> 01:05:06.670]  You don't want to do that.
[01:05:06.830 --> 01:05:07.930]  You probably shouldn't.
[01:05:08.050 --> 01:05:09.790]  I would think that it's not a good idea.
[01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:11.070]  I'm sending this photo right now.
[01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:14.530]  I don't think you understand where I am in relation to this machine.
[01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:15.410]  I think we need to clear this up.
[01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:16.330]  I think you're in the bathroom.
[01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:20.150]  No, right now I'm currently sitting at my desk to record.
[01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:21.230]  Right. Yeah.
[01:05:21.370 --> 01:05:23.070]  You could have recorded it like this.
[01:05:23.530 --> 01:05:27.310]  No, I couldn't have. I can't reach the button, and it turns off every time it goes through.
[01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:32.210]  But... so you... so Operates, you have to hold down the button, or you just tap the button?
[01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:35.450]  You push the button, and typically it gets the ball really quickly,
[01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:38.810]  and then it turns off, and you have to hit the button again to draw it again.
[01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:41.130]  So by the time I sat down...
[01:05:41.130 --> 01:05:43.570]  It takes 20 seconds for a freaking ball to come out.
[01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:44.510]  It does. Do you want to know why?
[01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:44.910]  It's a 20 second video.
[01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:47.070]  Do you want to know why? Do you want to know why that happened?
[01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:48.610]  I can get us another photo right now.
[01:05:48.890 --> 01:05:49.310]  Oh boy.
[01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:51.070]  You would have had enough time to hit the button,
[01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:54.330]  pick up a sushi container, and sit in your chair, and it still wouldn't have come out.
[01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:55.690]  You're right, but this is what happened.
[01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:58.270]  Okay, I put the thing in... I put it in incorrectly.
[01:05:59.010 --> 01:06:01.050]  I put it in... it's not in correctly.
[01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.970]  So that's...
[01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:04.810]  So the machine doesn't... there's no integrity?
[01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:08.430]  So see, the plastic part is sort of at an angle.
[01:06:08.730 --> 01:06:09.850]  This is getting worse and worse.
[01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:12.770]  Is that so that you can put the 16 directly in the feed hole?
[01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:16.970]  No, I just didn't notice when I slammed it back down after he did the 16.
[01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:20.970]  No, no, no!
[01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:28.550]  It is amazing to me, Andrew, that you have an ability to weaken your case with each new photo.
[01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:30.570]  It's phenomenal!
[01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:35.150]  Can I fix the machine and then show how quickly it gets the ball?
[01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:36.270]  Can I do that right now?
[01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:39.010]  Geoff said that he was willing to just say,
[01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:40.810]  I don't believe you, but we can move on.
[01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:48.430]  And then you started sending photo evidence, and now nobody believes you, and we're not moving on.
[01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:51.290]  Nick said this is more intense than watching the Sapruta film.
[01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:57.790]  Eventually, he's gonna release... he's gonna go through all of his photos until eventually
[01:06:57.790 --> 01:07:00.950]  it shows him just putting the number 16 on the tray.
[01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:03.730]  No, but there's a box full of 16s to the right.
[01:07:06.270 --> 01:07:08.050]  Let me argue this, Eric, for a moment.
[01:07:08.410 --> 01:07:11.570]  The baseline was Geoff doesn't believe me, but we can move on.
[01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:15.170]  There's really nowhere to go but down in the fact that I know I'm innocent.
[01:07:15.350 --> 01:07:16.190]  I didn't do it.
[01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:19.010]  So I might as well continue to attempt to provide.
[01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:21.390]  And if nothing changes, I just remain where I was.
[01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:24.650]  I lose nothing in attempting to clear my name.
[01:07:25.110 --> 01:07:27.310]  I don't think you were remaining where you were, bud.
[01:07:27.350 --> 01:07:28.190]  I don't think you are either.
[01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:34.690]  Can I attempt to adjust the machine to show what I was anticipating as far as how quickly?
[01:07:35.810 --> 01:07:38.130]  Take us back in time four days.
[01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:41.470]  You're saying, like, why didn't you do this?
[01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:44.190]  And I said, because it immediately turns off once it finds a ball.
[01:07:44.530 --> 01:07:46.850]  Why didn't you wear shorts?
[01:07:47.350 --> 01:07:48.610]  We went over that already.
[01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:50.230]  We went over that.
[01:07:50.370 --> 01:07:53.710]  That means he's podcasting naked again.
[01:07:54.110 --> 01:07:55.710]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:07:55.890 --> 01:07:57.850]  This, first of all, we recorded early.
[01:07:57.990 --> 01:08:01.890]  I don't remember who did that, but we recorded earlier than normal on the West Coast.
[01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.550]  I woke up.
[01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:04.950]  I did some stuff for MVP, went into the recording.
[01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:08.190]  Didn't expect to be on my bingo machine reflective.
[01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:09.390]  Nobody needs to see that.
[01:08:09.610 --> 01:08:11.070]  I certainly don't want to see that.
[01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:12.770]  Now, I am owning.
[01:08:12.970 --> 01:08:13.670]  I botched the video.
[01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:14.570]  The video is terrible.
[01:08:14.810 --> 01:08:15.470]  It is horrendous.
[01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:16.130]  It does nothing.
[01:08:16.570 --> 01:08:18.850]  I think you somehow, either you did salad cream or Greg it.
[01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:22.030]  I'm sort of fuzzy now on the definition of both of those.
[01:08:22.410 --> 01:08:24.990]  But I, after all that, I still believe you for some reason.
[01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:27.070]  I think you actually pulled a 16.
[01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:31.010]  None of this is, this is all self-inflicted by me.
[01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:32.110]  Once again.
[01:08:32.790 --> 01:08:39.970]  I feel like if we ever have a face film festival, that's that that video is the main video.
[01:08:40.090 --> 01:08:43.230]  I want to see that in a theater with with 200 other people.
[01:08:43.710 --> 01:08:48.590]  I want to run that still frame through some AI that somehow like demotion blurs.
[01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:49.250]  Yeah.
[01:08:49.730 --> 01:08:50.990]  And see what it comes out with you.
[01:08:52.730 --> 01:08:53.750]  That was great.
[01:08:56.650 --> 01:08:59.350]  He's he's turning on the fucking bingo machine.
[01:08:59.670 --> 01:09:01.970]  He can't let sleeping dogs lie.
[01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:03.690]  What do you think that's going to do?
[01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:05.170]  No, I have no.
[01:09:05.410 --> 01:09:07.490]  What did he think any of this was going to do?
[01:09:07.930 --> 01:09:09.530]  What was going to absolve him?
[01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:10.650]  Oh, boy.
[01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:17.050]  I mean, Geoff, you have to know that we've me and Nick have known about this since Monday
[01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:18.370]  and had to sit on it.
[01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:19.990]  And it has been very difficult.
[01:09:20.370 --> 01:09:21.950]  Dude, that is wild.
[01:09:22.230 --> 01:09:25.250]  Let me say, I don't know how you guys have handled it.
[01:09:25.270 --> 01:09:26.750]  And that's why I could tell.
[01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:29.670]  I could tell there was a lot going on yesterday when I was mentioning to you
[01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:33.010]  that I thought that I question the integrity of the competition.
[01:09:33.490 --> 01:09:35.270]  I couldn't tip my hand.
[01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:38.590]  But at the same time, how what what is there to believe?
[01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:40.730]  Why was it filmed like that?
[01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:45.530]  I said, I don't know what he's doing.
[01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:47.810]  Try to fix the machine.
[01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:49.870]  It's not popping in.
[01:09:56.410 --> 01:09:58.330]  We've got a camera in his bedroom.
[01:09:59.670 --> 01:10:01.430]  What are you doing?
[01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:04.210]  Maybe we should get...
[01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:08.230]  I think I got it.
[01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:09.570]  Okay.
[01:10:11.770 --> 01:10:13.530]  Hey, guys, I think he's got it.
[01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:15.810]  Oh, I did need some plug.
[01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:16.710]  One sec.
[01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:17.610]  Some plug.
[01:10:19.890 --> 01:10:22.410]  It always sounds like he's wrestling his environment.
[01:10:22.650 --> 01:10:25.590]  Like everything that's upright is like falling on him in the background.
[01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:30.910]  It's like, it's like Leslie Nielsen in the Naked Gun.
[01:10:31.670 --> 01:10:34.070]  Like, or no, OJ Simpson.
[01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:36.370]  When he's on the tugboat.
[01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:37.470]  Oh, my God.
[01:10:37.730 --> 01:10:40.810]  Puts his foot in a bear trap and pulls out the window.
[01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:43.490]  Puts his hand on the hot stove.
[01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:53.190]  It's so loud.
[01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:56.550]  See how quick that was?
[01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:58.610]  How am I going back?
[01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:05.050]  Is it still in the same place now as the way it was in that picture?
[01:11:05.790 --> 01:11:06.450]  Now it drops.
[01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:13.130]  I like his point that it happened so fast he can't get back in time to film from a different
[01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:13.470]  angle.
[01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:17.110]  Yet the one video we get to watch was filmed from another room.
[01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:19.050]  Well, because it's next to it.
[01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:20.250]  It's the rooms are next to it.
[01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:24.750]  So you're saying if it's if it's on the fridge, you're saying you can't hit the button and
[01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:26.230]  sit down and have a video of it coming out?
[01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:29.590]  Yeah, not from where I was sitting.
[01:11:29.650 --> 01:11:29.830]  No.
[01:11:31.890 --> 01:11:32.150]  Hmm.
[01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:34.150]  I'll try right now.
[01:11:34.810 --> 01:11:35.210]  Yeah.
[01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:39.410]  I'm going to put the ball back in there.
[01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:43.590]  So he's not he's not filming this or I don't I don't know.
[01:11:45.650 --> 01:11:46.790]  Yeah, you should film it.
[01:11:47.230 --> 01:11:49.890]  What is this fucking podcast at this point?
[01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:55.290]  What have we become?
[01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:58.490]  Oh, oh, Lord.
[01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:05.180]  Well, now it's going to take that sounds like plenty of time.
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:07.680]  There goes a little time in the world.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:10.160]  Ah, the shoot malfunctioned.
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:17.000]  Stuck in the shoot.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:23.020]  I'm not kidding.
[01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:23.860]  It's stuck to the tray.
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:24.760]  I don't know what it is.
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:29.520]  If I was over there, I could just move the shoot and this wouldn't be a problem.
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:32.940]  Look at that.
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:33.900]  Stuck in the shoot.
[01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:36.960]  Classic stuck in the shoot scenario.
[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:42.440]  Well, there you have it.
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:45.160]  Another episode of faces in the books.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:58.560]  That was like 10 minutes of you just incriminating yourself.
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:00.740]  I'm innocent.
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:06.400]  Just watch a man shoot himself in the foot over and over.
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:09.840]  That was the equivalent of sending your text to the wrong lawyer.
[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:12.380]  No, but I didn't do it.
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:14.500]  I'm innocent.
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:16.320]  I'm going to throw up from laughing.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:19.060]  I got P and I completely ruined it.
[01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:21.920]  I got the letter P and you got 16.
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.260]  The ultimate in face law.
[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:26.380]  We should also say a very visual episode.
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.920]  All the pictures are in the video files on YouTube.
[01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:30.920]  They're also on Instagram.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.500]  I assume in about 19.
[01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:33.520]  Probably going to take a few.
[01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:36.480]  Yeah, we'll probably have one for each contest.
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:39.580]  And then the Andrew Ball saga.
[01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:41.960]  Like and subscribe.
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.020]  I heard the ball fall.
[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:50.980]  It's not six.
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:51.420]  Cut.
[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:56.940]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:58.500]  Geoff can't hold his water.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.400]  Don't drink from the water heater.
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:02.180]  Let's make a movie podcast.
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:03.840]  British food is strange.
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.940]  Bingo is the greatest dog movie of all time.
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.620]  What happened to the monkey movie?
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:10.420]  It's Geoff's tiny town.
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:13.180]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:16.040]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
