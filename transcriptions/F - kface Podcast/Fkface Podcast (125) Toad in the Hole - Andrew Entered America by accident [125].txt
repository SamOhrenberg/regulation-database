[00:22.140 --> 00:33.080]  What was that? What the fuck is that noise? What the fuck is going on? What was that?
[00:33.280 --> 00:44.480]  What was that? What happened? I was doing dumb throat clears. And then you started doing
[00:44.480 --> 00:48.480]  dumb throat clears, Geoff, and my mouth was filled with water, and I just did like four
[00:48.480 --> 00:59.260]  spit takes. Oh, my wall is dripping. Is it on the wall? It's on the wall. It shot everywhere.
[00:59.660 --> 01:09.920]  Were we rolling for that? I was. Oh, great. Welcome to F*** Face 125. First episode of
[01:09.920 --> 01:15.280]  season five, apparently. Oh, yeah. What a great way to end season four. My own death.
[01:15.640 --> 01:21.500]  Oh, my Lord. Andrew, I got to say, man, that was... I hope you never change. That was the
[01:21.500 --> 01:29.120]  most entertaining 25 minutes of my life, maybe. I'm an innocent man. Andrew managed to take
[01:29.120 --> 01:34.340]  the most boring part of the... well, he had the easiest part and somehow came off as the
[01:34.340 --> 01:38.460]  best part of that challenge, which was incredible. It's phenomenal. You know what blew me away
[01:38.460 --> 01:42.620]  the most? What blew you away the most? We went an entire episode without mentioning
[01:42.620 --> 01:47.840]  Extra Medium. Geoff, why do you do that? Let's just move on. We're done. I almost made a
[01:47.840 --> 01:50.920]  reference to it accidentally, and I was like, don't want to do that. Let's step away from
[01:50.920 --> 01:57.720]  that. Hey, speaking of making references to shit that has come up a lot lately, should
[01:57.720 --> 02:03.240]  we talk about why we pushed the monkey movie again? Oh, yeah. I think this is the last
[02:03.240 --> 02:07.520]  time we should mention if it gets pushed because we've been ridiculous. I was saying
[02:07.520 --> 02:12.260]  to Nick earlier, I wonder if we took every moment of a scheduling it that we've recorded.
[02:12.520 --> 02:17.560]  How much how much is that footage? How long is is there an episode? Is there a full episode
[02:17.560 --> 02:22.520]  worth of us discussing the scheduling of MVP, too? Because it was supposed to. What what
[02:22.520 --> 02:28.740]  date did Nick say the first one was like March or March 8? Jesus was the date. The initial
[02:28.740 --> 02:36.460]  recording date for Monkey Movie to March 18th. I mean, that sounds good to me. I don't
[02:36.460 --> 02:40.360]  think you can commit to March 18th next year. If I thought if I thought that if I thought
[02:40.360 --> 02:44.400]  we could submit that date and we would do it, it would be worth it to me because we're
[02:44.400 --> 02:48.300]  not going to film till then anyway, just based on how this is going. But I don't trust that
[02:48.300 --> 02:53.000]  if we if we set it in stone, March 18th, there's like an 80 percent chance you won't
[02:53.000 --> 02:59.920]  be here at least. So it's my fault again. But it was sort of it was expected. I felt
[02:59.920 --> 03:03.520]  like the last time we recorded, you gave off a tone that was like, it's probably going
[03:03.520 --> 03:07.740]  to get moved, but you just don't want to say it. Yeah, well, I was juggling the the rental
[03:07.740 --> 03:12.460]  days of a camera being available, the quarry being available. And when Dan was in and
[03:12.460 --> 03:17.300]  it just came to everything's only going to line up tomorrow, which is when we're going
[03:17.300 --> 03:25.140]  No, totally. Yeah, understood. It gives me more time to perfect. Wow. What did I say?
[03:25.380 --> 03:29.300]  That was a fucking horrible combination of words trying to perfect. It allows me more
[03:29.300 --> 03:38.420]  time to work on the banana. That's probably my favorite flub. Perfect. Perfect. It was
[03:38.420 --> 03:43.840]  so bad. Typically, when you flub, you could see like the person was thinking between two
[03:43.840 --> 03:47.240]  different words and they kind of got mixed. They didn't know what to go with. Perfinect
[03:47.240 --> 03:52.140]  is nothing. There's just nothing that's wrong. That's just a miss. I was I was doing another
[03:52.140 --> 03:58.080]  podcast with Jack this morning. Superfan Jack, who, by the way, made a face appearance. I
[03:58.080 --> 04:03.080]  wish I mentioned. But oh, really? Yeah, I'll tell you about a second. Anyway, we were doing
[04:03.080 --> 04:06.560]  the one of the other podcasts with him this morning as a busy podcast. This is my fourth
[04:06.560 --> 04:14.640]  podcast today. But he mispronounced enthusiasm, enthusiasm, and didn't know. I just kept going.
[04:14.820 --> 04:18.600]  I stopped the pod. I was like, I held my hand. I was like, we got to stop. It sounds like
[04:18.600 --> 04:26.620]  a really psyched up room. Yeah. That you said enthusiasm. And he was like, oh, did I? It
[04:26.620 --> 04:31.540]  was fucking awesome. Oh, I've just for one week, if we ever have time, I've plopped a
[04:31.540 --> 04:35.820]  little video in the Slack channel. Oh, you did? Well, that's exciting. I'll be honest.
[04:35.820 --> 04:40.580]  I really don't have anything for this episode. So you go right ahead. Yeah. Why don't you
[04:40.580 --> 04:44.960]  hit hit play on three, maybe? Well, I already hit play. Can you want to sneak up, Geoff?
[04:45.440 --> 04:58.080]  One, two, three. Here we go. If you ask someone what size shirt they needed. I asked someone
[04:58.080 --> 05:06.360]  what size shirt? Yeah. Yeah. And they said extra medium. Yeah. What size shirt would you bring them?
[05:09.680 --> 05:23.640]  Just a medium? Yes. Just a medium? Why? And you wouldn't bring them a large? No. No. Just bring them a medium. Yeah. I think they were a muppet. Why?
[05:25.900 --> 05:31.280]  I've seen the video. I feel like my video proves more than what Gavid just posted. My
[05:31.280 --> 05:36.960]  video confirms more. I don't know. Dan thinks that that should be. It's just Dan's opinion.
[05:37.360 --> 05:47.700]  I don't know. I don't understand what you're trying to say. I feel like you've already won Gavid. I just never provided anyone else's opinion. I just thought that was an interesting one. I just asked him randomly. And he also insulted Eric, basically, at the end, which I thought was worth posting.
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.920]  That's true. The guy you spend that much time with and have a successful channel with
[05:52.920 --> 06:22.580]  and livelihood depends on you guys working together. You asked him randomly, and then he just sort of agreed with you. That's pretty crazy. Yeah, I got it. What does that have to do with whether he he's never heard that before? What do you mean? Well, you you don't know that at all, first of all. And secondly, secondly, out of all the people on earth, and no offense, listen, let me preface this by saying, I genuinely love Dan. I have an affection for him. I've gotten to know him over the last decade or so.
[06:23.100 --> 06:51.120]  I've seen him grow up and blossom into the successful man that he is. I think he's the best. I really I genuinely enjoy time with him when I get to have it. Had a great dinner with him earlier this year when we all went to dinner on the windy night. But if I'm asking anybody's opinion on something that requires intelligence, he's he's he's low. He's low on that list. Like I would probably ask somebody at a gas station first. All right, fair play.
[06:52.120 --> 07:13.160]  I do appreciate you called out that he insulted Eric, and that's always fun. Called him a Muppet. Yeah, that's good. That's enjoyable. I don't is that I don't even know if that is an insult. I don't know what that is. I guess not. I would be pretty excited if I was called a Muppet. I love the Muppets. That's what yeah, that's like saying I thought being chuffed was being mad, but apparently it's not. I don't like none of this makes sense to me.
[07:16.940 --> 07:42.500]  So all the times people have been chuffed with you, you're like, wow, what's that problem? Yeah, I like people have said that and they just go, I mean, OK, I'm sorry. Whoops. But what does chuffed mean? I thought I'd been bothered. Yeah, I'm really happy. Yeah, it means it means you're stoked on something. And I didn't know that. Doesn't sound stoked. Can I ask a random sort of question about Microsoft Word, Microsoft whatever your system is?
[07:42.500 --> 08:00.800]  Is it subscription only for everything now? Do they only do subscriptions for that stuff? You mean like Microsoft Office? Yeah, like Microsoft Office, all this stuff. Is it subscription only at this stage? Does anyone use it? Does anyone try to? Might be like you could. Could you go to the store and just buy a license for like the latest version?
[08:00.800 --> 08:27.240]  So, yeah, let me I'll just I'll I'll leave you yesterday. I spilled half of a liter of water on my Apple keyboard. Everything was fine. Oh, it got all over. Not really so much the F. It was like the bottom right of it. It was the right side, mainly. And that's like, I don't want to deal with this. So I just went to bed and I woke up and my keyboard was still wet, dried it off, waited a little bit. It was fine.
[08:27.240 --> 08:55.280]  Everything worked fine until the evening. Hours later, randomly, now when I hit keys, other keys appear than what I want to hit. So if I hit the P key, it gives me the P and the O and the U and the Y. And when I hit delete or backspace, it turns my keyboard off. My audio buttons are the plus sign and the one below. So everything has just been reassigned and I couldn't figure out what was going on.
[08:55.280 --> 09:23.560]  So I first, I changed the batteries, didn't fix it. Are you saying that you, you tried to dry it the next day? Well, it was, it was one of those things where I was so tired and I spilled water all over my desk. You couldn't just flip it upside down? Let it drain? I could have done. Listen, you're right. There are things I could have done. I made mistakes in the moment. I was very fatigued. I just wanted to go to bed. I wanted to be quiet, as quiet as I possibly could be. And I wanted to go to sleep.
[09:24.480 --> 09:49.220]  I fucked it up. I should have put it downwards. I did that when I woke up five hours later. But those are, those are precious five hours. And it worked fine. As I said, it worked fine for like five or six hours. And then all of a sudden, it just stopped. It stopped working. Maybe next time I'll try to send a message at some point. I'll reconnect. I'll try. It doesn't sound like it stopped working. It sounds like it just started working differently. That's a better way to put it.
[09:49.220 --> 09:56.280]  Can't you just like identify what each key does now and then just paint the new letter or function on top of it?
[09:56.420 --> 09:58.480]  So, re-label. Yeah, just re-label the keys.
[09:58.740 --> 10:12.820]  I thought about that. My B and N and M key no longer work. And there are not alternates to the keys that double. And anytime I go backwards to remove one of the double keys that I don't want, my keyboard turns off for a second.
[10:13.660 --> 10:21.780]  It desyncs. It is like the power button has been reassigned to the delete backspace button. It's a nightmare. It doesn't work at all.
[10:22.920 --> 10:30.160]  So, I thought, oh, how do I fix this? I tried changing the batteries. That didn't work. I tried rebooting my computer. That didn't work.
[10:30.520 --> 10:36.780]  I heard updating the OS if you're out of date could potentially solve keyboard issues. So, I updated my OS.
[10:37.380 --> 10:47.800]  Everything is fine. I go in. Once the new OS is up, it says, hey, your Microsoft Windows is out of date. You need to download this app to get it going.
[10:48.060 --> 10:55.480]  So, I tried to do that. Asked for my Apple ID, which I haven't used in a long time. I guess they locked me out of my account immediately when I got it wrong.
[10:55.640 --> 11:04.800]  Had to unlock my account. Forgot my new password. Had to change my password again. Had to go through. It was a whole effort. I was so mad.
[11:04.800 --> 11:14.300]  Just everything was complicated. Everything needed one more step. Ultimately, all this stuff led to me realizing that at least on Mac, I don't know if this is the same on Windows stuff,
[11:14.760 --> 11:22.760]  Windows runs the subscription. You can no longer just buy a disk and get Office. It would be like $80 a year. I'd have to pay $80 a year.
[11:22.960 --> 11:29.720]  The only reason why I updated is because I spilled water on my keyboard. I think I'd have to pay like $7 a month now if I want to keep Office.
[11:29.720 --> 11:38.700]  You could update the water out of your keyboard? I just didn't know if it was a sync issue. I was just going through all the steps I could possibly go through.
[11:39.160 --> 11:49.040]  Couldn't you just use Google Docs? Potentially. I do use Windows for a work-specific thing. So, I wanted to just keep that because I know how that works.
[11:49.360 --> 11:55.140]  I understand. You've got an architecture you like to work with. I have a system. I have everything laid out a specific way.
[11:55.140 --> 12:02.460]  So, I think trying to reverse water out of my keyboard by updating my OS is going to cost me $7 a month going forward.
[12:02.860 --> 12:08.680]  Unless I can find a workaround. I'm sure the one... I was just curious. I didn't know if... Well, I think we're all actually Mac users here.
[12:09.160 --> 12:12.780]  Do you have an errand cupboard? An errand cupboard?
[12:14.480 --> 12:24.600]  What? What is an errand cupboard? In England, it's where you put all the stuff you spill water on. It's like where the boiler is and you keep your towels in there.
[12:25.520 --> 12:32.820]  Every house stores the hot water for your boiler. You would refer to a towel as a thing you spill water on?
[12:35.420 --> 12:47.880]  It was a very hot, dry cupboard, right? So, it's nice to keep the towels in there. They stay all warm. You're just using the radiant heat byproduct.
[12:48.520 --> 12:52.640]  And if you spill on your keyboard, you just shove your keyboard in the errand cupboard for a few weeks.
[12:52.640 --> 13:03.300]  I'm sure everything you just said is sensible. I'm still in processing spilled off, Gavin. It's just such a weird... I'm getting out of the pool. I'll be with you guys in a minute. I just got to go spill off.
[13:03.660 --> 13:09.160]  I don't want to get water everywhere. What are you talking about? Is that what I said? You said spill.
[13:09.580 --> 13:16.560]  I don't think... I just don't think we have errand cupboards in America, unfortunately. Yeah, I don't have one in my house.
[13:17.620 --> 13:25.380]  Is that a thing? So, you buy your house in America. Do you go looking around the house and you're like, where the hell is the airing cupboard?
[13:25.620 --> 13:30.140]  Wait a minute. Does this house not have an airing cupboard? You just took it for granted it would be there.
[13:30.380 --> 13:36.820]  I got a tankless heater. But in England, I had a big freaking ginormous water tank that stored hot water.
[13:36.940 --> 13:43.020]  Yeah, there you go. I already posted a picture of one. And it would only come on twice a day. So, if you missed all the hot water in the morning,
[13:43.020 --> 13:47.440]  you have to either have a cold shower or wait until it came on at like 7 p.m.
[13:47.840 --> 13:54.180]  Ah, that sounds like the army. Yeah, that sucks. We had a bit of rationing. It's also why I think that
[13:54.180 --> 13:59.900]  in the UK, the tap, the hot and cold tap, are separate taps. Because you can drink the cold water,
[13:59.960 --> 14:05.480]  but you can't drink the hot water. Why is it not potable? Not potable. Really?
[14:06.640 --> 14:09.840]  But I know that's the thing people find weird is that if you're trying to wash your hands and you
[14:09.840 --> 14:13.720]  want warm water, you have to kind of like move your hand under the hot water and then under the cold one and
[14:13.720 --> 14:18.720]  you have to just go back and forth to make warm, or you just fill the sink. Oh, I don't like that.
[14:18.860 --> 14:23.600]  No, that doesn't... no. And you hold countries like that? Well, it's like the old houses. It's like a...
[14:23.600 --> 14:28.560]  I think it's like a post-war thing. Oh, okay. So like the new houses that they built probably...
[14:29.200 --> 14:34.380]  Yeah, a new house might have single taps and no airing cupboard, but I've never lived in one of them.
[14:35.760 --> 14:40.500]  Wow. Wow. Yeah, well, what about that, Andrew? Did you put it in your airing cupboard?
[14:40.820 --> 14:45.920]  I didn't. I wish I had one. I feel like I've seen this in houses, though, but I just didn't know that
[14:45.920 --> 14:51.600]  there was a specific name for it. I feel like I've seen this before. Yeah, I'll go with that.
[14:51.900 --> 14:58.080]  I've seen people put like shelves around... there's a photo of a hot water heater with
[14:58.080 --> 15:03.160]  some shelves in front of that. I've seen people like multi-use cupboards where hot water heaters
[15:03.160 --> 15:09.220]  go before. I keep the dog food in... well, I have a tankless one as well, but I keep the...
[15:09.220 --> 15:12.320]  where it was is like a HVAC now, and I keep the dog food there.
[15:13.440 --> 15:17.860]  How far are you, Geoff, in the Geoff achievement in Gems of War? Are we close on that?
[15:17.980 --> 15:24.480]  Thanks for asking. I am at 66 or 67 percent. I'm not sure which.
[15:25.600 --> 15:28.660]  You're getting close. I'm getting very close. I think the last time we talked about it was
[15:28.660 --> 15:35.360]  40 percent. You've made good progress. What I'm doing right now is other things in the game
[15:35.360 --> 15:42.680]  to boost my character, like in-game stuff to make it easier, but also collecting resources I need.
[15:43.120 --> 15:51.140]  So I could probably be like 72 percent right now if I wanted to, but I'm just kind of collecting
[15:51.140 --> 15:55.940]  resources and then I'll just do a bunch all at once. But yeah, thanks. I still play every day.
[15:55.940 --> 15:59.040]  I'm still working on it actively. Do you think you'll do the face thing
[15:59.040 --> 16:04.040]  and play all the way to 99 percent and just stop? No, I'm definitely getting this stupid achievement.
[16:06.040 --> 16:10.420]  Now, who knows if I get if I like I'll get to 98 percent and the game will shut down or something
[16:10.420 --> 16:14.900]  that could happen. That's what I was going to say. Have you ever met anybody else that plays
[16:14.900 --> 16:19.180]  Gems of War? Because you're literally the only person I've ever heard of that plays it. I have
[16:19.180 --> 16:24.940]  no I don't know a single person. That'd be like a strange bonding moment for you if you met someone
[16:24.940 --> 16:29.540]  equally like the one other. It's you two are the ones that are keeping the server going. I'm sure
[16:29.540 --> 16:34.080]  it's insanely popular, but it's just I've never heard anybody. I mean, I don't know that it is
[16:34.540 --> 16:39.720]  really. I think it's I will say I think it's a lot more popular as a mobile and PC game.
[16:40.500 --> 16:45.940]  Yes, I think it's less popular as I think it's probably more popular as an Xbox game than a
[16:45.940 --> 16:49.480]  PlayStation game. And then there's a Switch version that came out not too terribly long
[16:49.480 --> 16:53.020]  ago as well. I think nobody plays those, but it's definitely more of like a PC mobile thing.
[16:53.020 --> 16:56.100]  How mad would you be, Geoff, if Andrew beat you to that achievement?
[16:56.600 --> 17:01.480]  Oh, I wouldn't. I wouldn't care at all. Yeah, I don't know. I'm glad you said that because
[17:01.480 --> 17:05.120]  you could have you could have been really mean and said you would care and then it would become
[17:05.120 --> 17:10.720]  content. And that was something that would have activated if you had been annoyed by it.
[17:10.840 --> 17:16.960]  No, I can't. I can't do that to him. That would be like a thousand hours of gameplay for him to
[17:16.960 --> 17:21.740]  get there. I also have been supportive of Geoff and his Gems of War thing whenever I get a I don't
[17:21.740 --> 17:26.700]  the codes do, but sometimes I get like a game pass here, get these free things in Gems of War.
[17:26.820 --> 17:30.420]  I was for Geoff. Yeah, you gave me a weapon. I really, really appreciated it. Thank you.
[17:30.980 --> 17:34.820]  Of course. I've no it's the funny thing of I don't I assume these things are useful to you.
[17:34.900 --> 17:39.320]  I've no clue what they do or how they work within the game, but they're useful in very specific
[17:39.320 --> 17:44.860]  instances, but they're more useful. And like if you don't get it now, it could take a year
[17:44.860 --> 17:49.080]  to get it again. So it's like a lot of it is collecting stuff you may need down the road.
[17:49.080 --> 17:54.260]  You know, that's crazy. Stuff gets re-released into the game in cycles. So it's like, oh,
[17:54.280 --> 17:58.180]  fuck, I missed that opportunity or that event. Well, well, I'll try again. Hopefully six months
[17:58.180 --> 18:03.980]  from now it'll show up again. It's so fascinating how games like that are profitable and not
[18:03.980 --> 18:09.380]  visible ways. Like, I feel like you don't ever hear conversations about Candy Crush anymore,
[18:09.380 --> 18:15.420]  but that's a game that makes like a billion dollars a year every year still. I wonder. I'm
[18:15.420 --> 18:19.660]  curious. I should look into Gems of War. I would like to know how much money the game
[18:19.660 --> 18:25.520]  Best Fiends makes, because that game has been advertised on every podcast I listen to for
[18:25.520 --> 18:32.840]  three years straight. Like what? Every Best Fiends, F-I-E-N-D-S. Yeah. I don't know that
[18:32.840 --> 18:38.060]  we've ever done an advertisement for it. Maybe we... I mean, we do Rooster Teeth, not F-I-E-N-D-S.
[18:40.160 --> 18:45.920]  But it's like I hear it on all my celebrity gossip podcasts, a bunch of different kinds. And
[18:46.820 --> 18:51.980]  it's kind of a Candy Crush type game. I played it for like a day. I wasn't into it. But
[18:53.000 --> 18:57.900]  yeah, I just I imagine their budget must be tremendous based on how many ads they're buying.
[18:58.460 --> 19:02.660]  Those are great. Terrible mobile game ads are always fantastic. There's so many of them.
[19:03.220 --> 19:09.560]  Just terrible. Best Fiends. Yeah, like I always hear it advertised on like on Tom Segura podcasts,
[19:09.660 --> 19:14.520]  and I'm pretty sure those aren't cheap. So I wonder how much it would cost to get like a uniform ad
[19:14.520 --> 19:18.780]  on a show. If you could put a uniform ad on any show, Geoff, what would you want it on? Dude,
[19:18.940 --> 19:22.740]  that's actually I'm really glad to hear you say that, because I was thinking the other day,
[19:22.760 --> 19:30.000]  like how how much would it cost us to just buy enough airtime to publish one episode of
[19:30.000 --> 19:37.260]  Does It Do late at night? That'd be such a great idea. I love that. Right. Like like on TV. Yeah.
[19:37.480 --> 19:43.260]  Yeah. Like a made for TV. Yeah. It's like an infomercial, right? Like how how expensive is
[19:43.260 --> 19:47.800]  that? Like three in the morning for 15 minutes? Does it do come? It doesn't do episode three
[19:47.800 --> 19:52.780]  comes. So I don't want to. This feels like it could be sausage talk in a sense we've talked
[19:52.780 --> 19:57.580]  about. I feel like a natural evolution of Does It Do is eventually for a product to come out of
[19:57.580 --> 20:03.040]  Does It Do. Yeah. Is that is that the moment you do it? Or would you rather just like episode one
[20:03.040 --> 20:08.400]  of Does It Do airs at this random channel at 2 a.m., 2 to 2.15 a.m.? I mean, I think I'm open
[20:08.400 --> 20:15.460]  to all options. It's more of a like and waiting for the opportunity to present itself in a way
[20:15.460 --> 20:19.160]  that feels right. You know what I mean? It's like you kind of you kind of you kind of surf the waves
[20:19.160 --> 20:24.020]  of possibility instead of trying to make stuff happen. And so I just I feel like I feel like
[20:24.020 --> 20:28.080]  especially with Unifarm, I feel like the future is pregnant with possibilities. And we're just
[20:28.080 --> 20:33.100]  kind of like just kind of see see where things go. I like for instance, I think when the SwitchFuck
[20:33.100 --> 20:37.500]  comes out, I think that could be a very funny TikTok product. You know, we're not going to make
[20:37.500 --> 20:42.640]  enough to sell like that. But I could see a product like that going viral in a funny way on a platform
[20:42.640 --> 20:47.820]  like TikTok. I would love to place an ad for Unifarm just on one of our internal podcasts,
[20:48.640 --> 20:53.560]  because I assume most of the company doesn't know what that is. So we could easily sneak it by them.
[20:53.560 --> 21:00.740]  Well, I did do one for what was the I'm blanking on the name right now. Thank Me Later. I had a
[21:00.740 --> 21:06.380]  Thank Me Later ad on the Rooster Teeth podcast. That's true. That's true. That's true. That was
[21:06.380 --> 21:10.840]  brilliant, by the way. I think we should do it. I think we should cut some sort of a Unifarm promo
[21:11.240 --> 21:16.620]  that runs on. I mean, I guarantee you put it on Red Web. Oh, no, I just had an idea.
[21:16.940 --> 21:21.800]  I was great. I'm this is I'm happy with this. We haven't had it happen many times, but in the past
[21:21.800 --> 21:28.320]  we've had requests of like, hey, this new show is coming out. Can we run an ad for it on your feed?
[21:28.520 --> 21:34.140]  I feel like there needs to be an ad exchange. We will gladly allow an ad for another show on our
[21:34.140 --> 21:38.940]  feed in exchange for a potential Unifarm ad. Now, that's a good idea.
[21:39.360 --> 21:41.720]  Did John ever advertise our podcast on his show?
[21:42.640 --> 21:48.200]  I think John dislikes me because of your characterization of what happened.
[21:49.360 --> 21:54.440]  I think John might be mad at me. Let's get him to do a face on his one. Yeah.
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.540]  Is this does he still make that? What was the name of it?
[21:58.140 --> 22:00.220]  Tell. Toad in the Hole or something, was it?
[22:02.100 --> 22:05.220]  It's not real canon. That was it. Does he still make that?
[22:05.960 --> 22:09.100]  I don't think so. I don't think so. Toad in the Hole. I enjoyed it.
[22:09.340 --> 22:10.940]  So I didn't even work for it. Toad in the Hole.
[22:12.840 --> 22:15.860]  Can we now need to make a Toad in the Hole podcast?
[22:15.860 --> 22:19.760]  Get ready for a supplemental Toad in the Hole coming your way.
[22:19.840 --> 22:23.840]  Dude, Toad in the Hole should just be Gavin talking to British people about British shit.
[22:25.520 --> 22:28.100]  Like that's the Gab Dan podcast.
[22:28.980 --> 22:32.600]  I mean, if anything, that's an offshoot of sausage talk because there is a sausage
[22:32.600 --> 22:35.220]  in Toad in the Hole. That is true. That is true.
[22:35.740 --> 22:36.400]  That's a great point.
[22:36.640 --> 22:39.320]  I do think that's a really that is a really funny way, though, because you're right.
[22:39.580 --> 22:41.960]  We always get like, hey, somebody else in our
[22:42.420 --> 22:45.080]  periphery, in our ad network is like looking to trade ads.
[22:45.320 --> 22:48.360]  Does is anybody in the network amenable to it?
[22:48.380 --> 22:50.260]  And I always raise my hand and go like f*** faces.
[22:50.460 --> 22:53.520]  And then I never hear any word spoken again.
[22:53.620 --> 22:56.360]  I'm like, if they'll do if they'll run it out for f*** face,
[22:56.520 --> 22:57.580]  we'll run it out for theirs.
[22:57.700 --> 22:58.600]  And then it's like crickets.
[22:58.880 --> 23:00.720]  So maybe maybe I could get away with a uniform.
[23:01.160 --> 23:02.100]  I think that would work.
[23:02.200 --> 23:02.840]  I think it's worth it.
[23:03.180 --> 23:03.800]  I think it's great.
[23:04.040 --> 23:07.160]  What we should do, too, is we should get somebody else to do the voiceover.
[23:07.720 --> 23:09.700]  So it doesn't sound like us, right?
[23:09.700 --> 23:13.960]  Like Nick, I feel like I feel like Nick's Nick could pull it off or.
[23:14.720 --> 23:15.120]  Yeah, right.
[23:15.240 --> 23:19.540]  Oh, Nick said, oh, oh, he used to do radio ads.
[23:19.660 --> 23:20.720]  Do you have a radio voice, Nick?
[23:20.900 --> 23:21.700]  Could you do a different?
[23:22.620 --> 23:22.960]  Absolutely.
[23:23.140 --> 23:23.620]  I can't.
[23:23.660 --> 23:24.960]  Just give me something to read here.
[23:25.260 --> 23:29.440]  How about a uniform combining the power of one with the fabric of the form uniform uniform
[23:29.440 --> 23:33.660]  combining the fabric of one that combining the fabric of one with the fabric of the form.
[23:34.940 --> 23:35.280]  It's perfect.
[23:35.420 --> 23:38.300]  Well, we're going to get him a script, but the voice is great.
[23:39.860 --> 23:42.380]  I think what he just delivered is perfect for this show.
[23:42.400 --> 23:47.220]  I think that's the quality everybody comes to expect.
[23:47.300 --> 23:48.740]  Talk about legendary flubs.
[23:52.420 --> 23:53.440]  You know what?
[23:53.600 --> 23:54.220]  That was a beautiful moment.
[23:54.220 --> 23:56.180]  I wish I had the person's name.
[23:56.320 --> 23:59.500]  Somebody because we talked about when we're pitching ideas for the SwitchFuck,
[23:59.900 --> 24:01.760]  I brought up doing like a baseball version of it.
[24:01.960 --> 24:04.740]  Somebody was like, we should do that and call it a switch hitter.
[24:04.820 --> 24:06.060]  And I just I think that's so funny.
[24:06.240 --> 24:08.880]  I wish I knew the name, but whoever that was.
[24:08.880 --> 24:09.900]  It's a great comment.
[24:10.040 --> 24:11.260]  I think that's a great idea, too.
[24:11.340 --> 24:14.700]  And I don't know, you know, based on how successful the SwitchFuck is.
[24:14.780 --> 24:15.860]  Maybe we do do that.
[24:16.320 --> 24:17.040]  Maybe we make one.
[24:17.280 --> 24:17.820]  Why not? Right.
[24:18.080 --> 24:19.700]  I'm just excited about toad in the hole.
[24:20.960 --> 24:21.880]  That's going to be good.
[24:22.680 --> 24:24.400]  Yeah. When's episode one coming out of toad in the hole?
[24:25.660 --> 24:26.660]  That's the schedule, Eric.
[24:28.200 --> 24:30.940]  You're out of your you want to talk about scheduling?
[24:31.200 --> 24:33.060]  You want to talk about sometime after MVP, too?
[24:33.340 --> 24:36.920]  Yeah. As soon as we're done with monkey movie, we'll get that on the calendar, man.
[24:36.920 --> 24:41.740]  All you have to do is just book me and one other British person at the same time.
[24:42.440 --> 24:46.580]  But you know, that's the problem is Gavin doesn't like other British people.
[24:51.080 --> 24:53.460]  Anytime there'd be like a British person in the periphery.
[24:53.620 --> 24:55.940]  Gavin, I think he'd always be like, I don't like having them around.
[24:56.120 --> 24:58.360]  I want to be the only British person around here.
[25:01.320 --> 25:02.660]  Do you believe that, Eric?
[25:03.460 --> 25:05.920]  I think that you've said it one time.
[25:05.920 --> 25:11.220]  You think I've said I want to be the only British person around one time?
[25:11.280 --> 25:12.780]  He said it more than once.
[25:13.160 --> 25:17.620]  I think if Geoff is saying it, I think it happened one time, maybe.
[25:18.120 --> 25:21.180]  This all happened from one time we were out at a bar.
[25:25.300 --> 25:30.760]  This all stems from this one time we were at a bar and just some it was like South by Southwest.
[25:30.920 --> 25:34.740]  So there were more British people in town and one of them just like was chatting to us
[25:35.300 --> 25:39.180]  and Geoff just did that thing where he's like, why don't you like that guy?
[25:39.520 --> 25:43.220]  Why are you sitting next to that guy? And I was like, huh? That's where this came from.
[25:44.860 --> 25:47.360]  So what he's saying, Eric, is he did say it.
[25:48.180 --> 25:48.420]  Sure.
[25:54.860 --> 25:59.560]  I think what Toad in the Hole needs to be based on Gavin's hatred of British people,
[25:59.640 --> 26:03.500]  you can possibly have one show with one person.
[26:03.500 --> 26:06.920]  I think, Eric, you need to book like 12 British people.
[26:07.420 --> 26:11.320]  And Gavin, as soon as you get tired of the British person you're currently talking to,
[26:11.460 --> 26:14.880]  you yell Toad in the Hole. They have to immediately leave.
[26:15.060 --> 26:19.240]  And the next person comes in and it just goes as long as it goes.
[26:19.340 --> 26:21.100]  The series ends when we run out of Brits.
[26:21.560 --> 26:26.340]  And we'll have a Toad in the Hole on the desk and like for each sausage in the pan
[26:26.340 --> 26:29.340]  is one person that can come in and they have to take their sausage.
[26:30.520 --> 26:32.500]  This is great. We've already we've developed the show.
[26:32.500 --> 26:33.820]  I love sausage talk.
[26:34.220 --> 26:38.720]  Toad in the Hole is a food that Gavin has shown us.
[26:39.160 --> 26:43.980]  And Andrew has made it a catchphrase similar to fire in the hole
[26:43.980 --> 26:47.620]  to get somebody out as quickly as possible.
[26:48.020 --> 26:49.700]  And you have to take your sausage and leave.
[26:50.380 --> 26:51.460]  So whenever I get bored...
[26:52.800 --> 26:54.480]  Yeah, whenever you're done with them.
[26:55.100 --> 26:56.340]  You're like, you know, we're good.
[26:56.780 --> 26:58.260]  Toad in the Hole. They have to leave.
[26:58.260 --> 26:58.720]  Really?
[27:00.020 --> 27:04.120]  Yeah, well, exactly. You can't control that.
[27:04.300 --> 27:05.660]  And they don't know what that means.
[27:05.760 --> 27:08.260]  So they just they get pushed off set as soon as you say it.
[27:08.280 --> 27:09.240]  They don't understand what's coming.
[27:09.260 --> 27:10.000]  Who's doing the pushing?
[27:11.180 --> 27:13.220]  Anybody. I don't know. It's not my job.
[27:13.460 --> 27:14.820]  Listen, I came up with all the other stuff.
[27:14.900 --> 27:16.540]  You can figure out a thing or two about your own show.
[27:18.060 --> 27:19.980]  Bring in 80% of the genius here.
[27:21.100 --> 27:21.960]  Oh my god.
[27:21.960 --> 27:23.820]  Speaking of other other shows.
[27:25.960 --> 27:27.440]  I really want to do...
[27:27.440 --> 27:29.280]  We talked about doing a thing with TPG.
[27:29.760 --> 27:30.120]  Yeah.
[27:30.220 --> 27:31.580]  You guys need to see the notes for it.
[27:31.760 --> 27:33.080]  I would love to do the first one.
[27:33.180 --> 27:37.000]  We're talking about doing one of us with TPG and just rotating out different episodes.
[27:37.180 --> 27:37.400]  Okay.
[27:37.480 --> 27:38.700]  Based on the notes he gave.
[27:38.940 --> 27:40.060]  Like a Toad in the Hole sort of format.
[27:40.420 --> 27:41.960]  Like a Toad in the Hole sort of format.
[27:42.220 --> 27:43.820]  Yeah, exactly.
[27:44.340 --> 27:45.060]  You get it.
[27:45.940 --> 27:47.040]  I'd love to do the first one.
[27:47.420 --> 27:48.980]  I'm excited. That thing is great.
[27:49.260 --> 27:49.880]  And I feel like...
[27:49.880 --> 27:50.700]  Where do I see these notes?
[27:50.720 --> 27:50.960]  On the topic of...
[27:51.980 --> 27:52.720]  Yeah, we should...
[27:52.720 --> 27:53.940]  They need to be sent to you.
[27:54.000 --> 27:55.460]  Eric sent them to me in the past.
[27:56.320 --> 27:57.100]  They're not available.
[27:57.100 --> 27:57.960]  I don't have them queued up.
[27:58.020 --> 27:59.400]  I'm just thinking about TPG.
[27:59.580 --> 28:01.160]  Are they trending in your Microsoft Word account?
[28:01.640 --> 28:02.140]  They are.
[28:02.260 --> 28:04.960]  And I can't open them unless I give them $8.95.
[28:05.220 --> 28:06.860]  They're clogging up the bingo machine.
[28:06.980 --> 28:07.780]  They're stuck in the tube.
[28:10.340 --> 28:11.220]  I got...
[28:11.220 --> 28:11.980]  And we all did.
[28:12.520 --> 28:17.760]  One of the best unexpected emails I've ever received in a long time.
[28:18.060 --> 28:19.620]  The Apple Odyssey 2K22.
[28:19.960 --> 28:21.540]  And nobody responded, by the way.
[28:21.800 --> 28:22.800]  Well, I didn't know...
[28:22.800 --> 28:24.660]  I didn't really know what to reply to.
[28:24.780 --> 28:26.960]  It sounds like a great offer, I guess.
[28:27.100 --> 28:28.480]  No, I guess it is.
[28:28.600 --> 28:30.300]  I'm excited to pick apples at some point.
[28:30.760 --> 28:31.740]  I didn't know...
[28:31.740 --> 28:34.180]  I forget that TPG is a Boston guy.
[28:34.680 --> 28:34.800]  Yes.
[28:35.020 --> 28:36.020]  Nothing about him feels Boston.
[28:37.040 --> 28:37.360]  Really?
[28:38.300 --> 28:39.060]  To me, yeah.
[28:39.100 --> 28:41.860]  No, he feels very West Coast to me and my interactions with him.
[28:42.040 --> 28:43.420]  I mean, he's been on both coasts.
[28:44.100 --> 28:44.460]  Yeah.
[28:45.040 --> 28:46.000]  Bit of a mixed bag, isn't he?
[28:47.060 --> 28:50.140]  Well, I've spent the least amount of time with him, I'd say, out of the three.
[28:50.220 --> 28:53.500]  But just in the stories I've heard and the interactions I've had,
[28:54.040 --> 28:55.640]  feels very, like, Californian.
[28:55.800 --> 28:56.040]  Okay.
[28:56.700 --> 28:58.140]  He's a huge Celtics fan.
[28:58.380 --> 28:58.740]  Is he?
[28:58.960 --> 28:59.680]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28:59.700 --> 29:00.040]  Big time.
[29:00.280 --> 29:00.600]  Big time.
[29:00.760 --> 29:01.880]  Should talk to him about that.
[29:02.240 --> 29:02.760]  That's a great email.
[29:02.900 --> 29:03.480]  I made my day.
[29:03.580 --> 29:06.240]  That TPG email, genuinely, I was so happy to see it.
[29:06.260 --> 29:06.620]  It's great.
[29:06.980 --> 29:08.440]  Have you explained what it is yet in this?
[29:08.840 --> 29:09.520]  What, the email?
[29:10.420 --> 29:11.980]  Like, do people know what you're talking about?
[29:12.220 --> 29:13.820]  No, I guess not, without any context.
[29:13.900 --> 29:15.380]  I mean, do they know who TPG is?
[29:15.460 --> 29:17.180]  To what extent do I need to read the sentence?
[29:18.720 --> 29:20.100]  We've talked about TPG.
[29:20.260 --> 29:23.200]  He's the guy who Gavin used to go to the...
[29:23.200 --> 29:25.340]  go to movies with and have, like, the cool guy movie club.
[29:26.240 --> 29:28.460]  And then he moved to, back home to Boston.
[29:28.780 --> 29:32.060]  Well, I'm pretty sure I just joined Eric and TPG's movie club.
[29:32.460 --> 29:32.860]  Oh, okay.
[29:33.960 --> 29:35.500]  And he's a guy that we all like a lot.
[29:36.160 --> 29:36.640]  Yeah, he's great.
[29:38.000 --> 29:40.340]  He sent an email asking, or not asking,
[29:40.400 --> 29:44.960]  I guess inviting us to explore different apples based out of the mass area.
[29:46.100 --> 29:46.280]  Yeah.
[29:46.400 --> 29:46.820]  It was exciting.
[29:47.160 --> 29:48.940]  It was a very enthusiastic and clever email.
[29:49.060 --> 29:50.020]  Is it post-November?
[29:50.560 --> 29:51.580]  Well, that's the thing.
[29:51.600 --> 29:53.120]  He didn't give a specific date at all.
[29:53.580 --> 29:56.100]  Theoretically, it could be post-November.
[29:56.360 --> 29:57.880]  So you'll set foot in Boston?
[29:58.480 --> 30:00.220]  I would be willing to post-November.
[30:00.300 --> 30:01.340]  Yeah, I'm open to that idea.
[30:01.660 --> 30:01.880]  Good.
[30:02.120 --> 30:03.620]  I've been very clear this entire time.
[30:03.920 --> 30:04.200]  Okay.
[30:04.720 --> 30:05.440]  Post-November.
[30:05.720 --> 30:06.360]  Post-November.
[30:06.740 --> 30:08.000]  No, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[30:08.460 --> 30:09.360]  What is post-November?
[30:09.740 --> 30:10.300]  Are you...
[30:10.300 --> 30:11.760]  But by saying post-November...
[30:11.760 --> 30:13.180]  Sounds like December 1st to me.
[30:13.220 --> 30:13.760]  No, you're right.
[30:13.880 --> 30:15.620]  That was bad phrasing on my part.
[30:16.340 --> 30:16.860]  It was bad phrasing.
[30:16.940 --> 30:17.380]  So from November on...
[30:17.380 --> 30:18.500]  I don't want to get into it here.
[30:19.020 --> 30:20.300]  I'm not going to expand on this.
[30:20.580 --> 30:21.320]  It's a personal thing.
[30:21.320 --> 30:23.880]  I did accidentally enter America recently.
[30:24.440 --> 30:24.960]  Was an accident.
[30:25.440 --> 30:26.480]  Didn't mean to.
[30:27.440 --> 30:28.460]  I was there.
[30:28.680 --> 30:29.160]  So I did.
[30:29.300 --> 30:30.420]  I broke the November thing.
[30:30.620 --> 30:31.720]  But it wasn't my choice.
[30:32.080 --> 30:32.100]  Yeah.
[30:32.160 --> 30:34.700]  It was a brief thing that occurred.
[30:35.720 --> 30:37.180]  And I apologize.
[30:37.660 --> 30:40.260]  You think it's like you tripped over a log across the border.
[30:40.400 --> 30:40.660]  What happened?
[30:40.840 --> 30:42.040]  I sort of did.
[30:42.140 --> 30:43.880]  I'm not going to get into all the details.
[30:44.200 --> 30:45.260]  It's a personal story.
[30:45.620 --> 30:46.340]  Sounds super legal.
[30:46.640 --> 30:47.200]  It was.
[30:47.400 --> 30:48.260]  It was legal.
[30:48.480 --> 30:49.520]  It was on the way up.
[30:50.060 --> 30:51.020]  It's very approved.
[30:51.020 --> 30:52.160]  Well, on behalf.
[30:52.160 --> 30:54.960]  I was in the U.S. and they yelled toad in the hole and I had to get immediately removed.
[30:55.160 --> 30:55.740]  It was a whole.
[30:57.160 --> 30:58.420]  This is how the law works.
[30:58.620 --> 31:02.400]  On behalf of all Americans, let me say it was great to have you and we hope you come back.
[31:07.700 --> 31:09.840]  Now a word from our sponsor, BetterHelp.
[31:10.760 --> 31:14.480]  Sometimes I found things can be really overwhelming,
[31:14.660 --> 31:18.100]  especially if there are issues that just keep on mounting and you're
[31:18.100 --> 31:20.180]  stuck in kind of like a problem solving mode.
[31:20.180 --> 31:25.120]  But just as things increase, those issues, even if they're small,
[31:25.640 --> 31:29.200]  just when you have a lot going on, it can be difficult to sort through them and navigate and
[31:29.200 --> 31:32.820]  have effective strategies on working through those problems.
[31:33.500 --> 31:36.500]  It can be tough to train your brain to stay in a problem solving mode
[31:36.500 --> 31:38.100]  when faced with a challenge in life.
[31:38.560 --> 31:41.560]  But when you learn how to find your own solutions, there's no better feeling.
[31:42.160 --> 31:44.440]  A therapist can help you become a better problem solver,
[31:44.780 --> 31:48.500]  making it easier to accomplish your goals no matter how big or small.
[31:49.040 --> 31:51.700]  Therapy is something that has had a huge impact in my life
[31:52.180 --> 31:56.300]  and has helped me in so many ways in sorting through all sorts of issues.
[31:57.360 --> 32:02.740]  I would recommend it to anyone, really, and encourage you to try it,
[32:02.740 --> 32:04.380]  even if you're in a pretty good place.
[32:04.480 --> 32:07.800]  It's just it's a really healthy thing to experience,
[32:08.020 --> 32:11.140]  and it has provided a tremendous benefit to my personal life.
[32:11.580 --> 32:15.280]  So if you're thinking of giving therapy a try, BetterHelp is a great option.

[33:53.640 --> 33:58.000]  Using the internet without ExpressVPN is like leaving your phone by the side of the tub.
[33:58.300 --> 34:00.900]  Most of the time you're probably fine, but other times you'll
[34:00.900 --> 34:04.220]  turn and realize that your phone has now died a watery death.
[34:04.220 --> 34:09.420]  Why does everyone need a VPN? Because every time you connect to an unencrypted network,
[34:09.560 --> 34:14.060]  whether it be cafes, hotels, or airports, any hacker on the same network can gain access
[34:14.060 --> 34:19.500]  to your personal data, passwords, financial details, all of that important personal stuff.
[34:20.020 --> 34:22.460]  It doesn't take much technical knowledge to hack someone,
[34:22.840 --> 34:26.040]  just some cheap hardware is needed. A smart 12 year old could do it.
[34:26.420 --> 34:31.800]  Your data is valuable. Hackers can make up to $1,000 per person selling personal info
[34:31.800 --> 34:36.040]  on the dark web. Now there's all sorts of reasons why to use ExpressVPN,
[34:36.280 --> 34:39.080]  but some of my favorites are that the fact they have an encrypted tunnel.
[34:39.560 --> 34:42.700]  It creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet.
[34:43.140 --> 34:46.880]  Hackers can't steal your sensitive data that way. It's super secure.
[34:47.140 --> 34:52.440]  It'd take a hacker with a supercomputer over a billion years to get past ExpressVPN's encryption.
[34:53.020 --> 34:57.460]  It's easy to use. All you have to do is fire up the app and click one button to get protected.
[34:57.460 --> 35:03.500]  Works on all of your devices, phones, laptops, tablets, and more. So you can stay secure on the
[35:03.500 --> 35:08.920]  go. ExpressVPN is a fantastic service. I've used it to view content libraries in other countries.
[35:09.000 --> 35:14.380]  It was how I watched the spelling bee. It's great. I love it. So secure your online data today

[35:33.420 --> 35:38.360]  Am I... could I be involved in your thing, Gavin? Because I'm from BC,
[35:38.920 --> 35:43.320]  which is British Columbia. Do I get like a little bit of credit?
[35:44.460 --> 35:46.560]  The queen is on my money. True.
[35:46.560 --> 35:54.740]  I feel like if it's the equivalent... I'm as British as goldfish are... goldfish crackers are
[35:54.740 --> 36:00.860]  a G food. Yeah. I think those are equal. Hey, speaking of which, I have a procedural
[36:00.860 --> 36:07.020]  question. Does this mean now... does all the money get reprinted with King Charles?
[36:07.680 --> 36:11.420]  I have no idea. That's an interesting thought. Do you know that, Gavin?
[36:11.980 --> 36:15.200]  I mean, I assume that when they make new... I don't think they're gonna...
[36:15.200 --> 36:18.420]  Like, they're not going to invalidate all the existing money. They'll just,
[36:18.500 --> 36:22.180]  like, going forward, start printing him. Yeah. I mean, to be fair, they should just
[36:22.180 --> 36:29.060]  probably skip him altogether. He somehow, like... he looks older than she did.
[36:29.720 --> 36:33.020]  Well, that's what I was saying in that picture, right? Yeah. It's wild.
[36:33.600 --> 36:38.080]  Yeah. I don't know. I mean, the coronation... I think the coronation can take up to, like...
[36:38.680 --> 36:44.360]  I think the queen was technically queen for over a year before she was coronated. So it's all a very
[36:44.360 --> 36:49.660]  slow changeover. Even though, technically, he was immediately the king. Probably a lot of
[36:49.660 --> 36:55.820]  paperwork. Who would you say is the most beloved British figure living at this point? Beckham?
[36:56.200 --> 37:00.660]  Really? You think Beckham ranks? Rowan Atkinson. Yeah.
[37:01.100 --> 37:03.720]  Are we talking international? Because, like, I think David Beckham.
[37:05.620 --> 37:08.940]  Maybe Peru. I don't even know who Paul Hollywood is. Who is Paul Hollywood?
[37:09.320 --> 37:12.420]  He's one of the judges on Great British Bake Off.
[37:12.420 --> 37:14.400]  Oh, okay. He's got the frosted tips.
[37:14.620 --> 37:16.680]  Oh, that guy! That's Paul Hollywood? Yeah.
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.520]  Okay. I can see him. It's a great name, by the way.
[37:20.580 --> 37:22.080]  Sounds real. It's a fantastic name.
[37:24.200 --> 37:31.560]  Hey, speaking of other shows, real fast, just some housekeeping. So we did what was formally
[37:31.560 --> 37:35.960]  known as... and this is also serving as a notification to you guys. Eric and I shot
[37:35.960 --> 37:42.400]  what was formerly known as F*** Face Break Shit yesterday. It was kind of a surprise episode.
[37:42.960 --> 37:48.480]  And it was a surprise because Eric and I were both very, very, very busy the last couple days,
[37:48.580 --> 37:52.600]  and neither of us had the time to promote it. So we realized yesterday morning that nobody on
[37:52.600 --> 37:56.420]  earth knew we were about to do a break show. So I tried to cancel it, and Eric was too
[37:56.420 --> 38:00.860]  professional to let me do that. And so we did it anyway. But then as a big surprise,
[38:01.620 --> 38:06.260]  minor fan, I guess, Major League Fan Jack showed up and shared the whole thing with us.
[38:06.760 --> 38:07.120]  Wow.
[38:07.180 --> 38:12.380]  So he has actually appeared on that show now. And he was great on it. And it was great to have him,
[38:12.400 --> 38:16.700]  I gotta admit. But also, and the reason I said formally is I've decided, and I hope you guys
[38:16.700 --> 38:22.360]  don't mind, but I've decided to change the name of that show to something less confusing. So I'm
[38:22.360 --> 38:26.720]  just going to call it The Break Show from here on out. And I think that that will help it attract
[38:26.720 --> 38:28.220]  audiences on YouTube that...
[38:28.220 --> 38:29.140]  The Break Show?
[38:29.140 --> 38:34.040]  The Break Show, yeah. It's a wider net to cast for...
[38:34.040 --> 38:35.260]  So you took f*** face off it?
[38:35.840 --> 38:37.220]  No, I took break shit off of it.
[38:38.060 --> 38:41.240]  Man, that really hampers our plans for the other show, f*** face make shit.
[38:42.100 --> 38:45.760]  No, it doesn't. We can still do that. Or we could call it The Make Show.
[38:48.780 --> 38:51.220]  Isn't that like a euphemism for taking a shit?
[38:52.720 --> 38:53.860]  It can be, yeah.
[38:54.240 --> 38:58.240]  Like I had to make water for peeing.
[38:58.240 --> 38:59.520]  The poo show.
[38:59.660 --> 38:59.700]  What?
[39:00.440 --> 39:02.620]  You never heard like, oh, the dog made on the floor?
[39:02.900 --> 39:03.240]  No.
[39:03.600 --> 39:04.460]  Yeah, I've heard that.
[39:04.820 --> 39:06.860]  I think it's like East Coast talk, isn't it?
[39:07.160 --> 39:09.740]  I have no idea. I've just never heard it.
[39:11.640 --> 39:17.560]  Anyway, so Jack, Jack actually showed up for once. And yeah, obviously, obviously y'all didn't.
[39:17.680 --> 39:20.500]  You were very busy. I get it. Emily didn't show up either. It was just Eric.
[39:20.540 --> 39:21.880]  You just said no one knew about it.
[39:23.880 --> 39:25.340]  No one being the audience.
[39:25.840 --> 39:29.140]  Well, in that case, why not cancel it?
[39:30.480 --> 39:34.200]  If no one knew about it and you wanted to cancel it, why didn't you just move it?
[39:34.920 --> 39:38.260]  My question is, did Jack know about it or did you trap him?
[39:38.660 --> 39:42.700]  No, Jack knew about it. It was something Eric did in the background.
[39:43.380 --> 39:45.880]  Like he invited Jack to it and I didn't know. He just showed up.
[39:45.880 --> 39:46.920]  Andrew, you knew about it.
[39:47.740 --> 39:49.800]  We both knew about it. We both said we couldn't do it.
[39:49.940 --> 39:51.980]  Yeah, Gavin, did you not know that you knew about it?
[39:54.400 --> 39:56.900]  You not only knew about it, you said no to it.
[39:57.260 --> 39:57.400]  Right.
[39:57.840 --> 39:59.200]  Okay. Yeah, I mean, I didn't.
[39:59.400 --> 40:00.560]  Okay. Okay.
[40:01.840 --> 40:05.140]  I just forgot. He said, can you do this? I said no. And I just forgot about it.
[40:05.340 --> 40:07.060]  I didn't know if it was the same one. It could have been a different one.
[40:07.080 --> 40:08.840]  You're making it sound like it popped up out of nowhere.
[40:10.420 --> 40:13.160]  To the audience, it did. That was the point I was making.
[40:13.820 --> 40:17.040]  I still don't understand why you wouldn't just move it if nobody was expecting it.
[40:17.040 --> 40:21.880]  Because we've been trying to schedule the monkey movie since March and it's about October.
[40:23.080 --> 40:27.020]  Yeah, he's right. And also we hadn't done one in September and I tried to do one a month.
[40:27.080 --> 40:29.080]  And if we didn't make it this week, we wouldn't get it in October.
[40:29.260 --> 40:31.260]  We wouldn't get it till mid-October. He was right.
[40:31.480 --> 40:33.400]  And it turned out to be a great show. We had a lot of fun.
[40:34.440 --> 40:36.660]  I don't even know how to tell you guys about Bingo.
[40:37.420 --> 40:39.040]  But I know about Bingo.
[40:39.080 --> 40:41.460]  You know about Bingo? I am very excited about Bingo.
[40:41.780 --> 40:45.960]  Bingo the dog, because somebody, one of Eric's friends sent in a pack of Bingo cards.
[40:46.280 --> 40:49.320]  And they were some of the best cards I have ever seen in my life.
[40:49.780 --> 40:51.220]  I've always wanted to see that movie.
[40:51.220 --> 40:53.200]  I haven't seen it before, but I just know.
[40:53.320 --> 40:56.260]  It's about a dog that does all sorts of crazy shit, right?
[40:56.380 --> 40:59.820]  Like an almost air bud, but like unlimited stuff.
[41:00.020 --> 41:05.080]  Yeah, he like, as I understand it, because Jack had seen it and was very excited to retell it.
[41:07.580 --> 41:14.980]  Bingo ended up in the circus somehow, but the circus boss was mean and made Bingo do bad.
[41:15.020 --> 41:17.700]  So yeah, Bingo had to jump through flames.
[41:18.180 --> 41:20.440]  We have a really sad card of Bingo staring at fire.
[41:20.440 --> 41:21.980]  And it just says, Bingo can't do it.
[41:22.080 --> 41:23.120]  And we want to put that on a shirt.
[41:24.100 --> 41:29.740]  And then somehow Bingo was owned by the place kicker for the New York Jets.
[41:29.980 --> 41:31.640]  Or no, for the, yeah, the Jets.
[41:31.800 --> 41:33.720]  He got, yeah, and then he got traded to the Packers.
[41:33.880 --> 41:36.800]  To the Packers, and then Bingo got lost along the way.
[41:37.060 --> 41:42.420]  Or he eventually got reunited and the bad circus boss got his, I guess.
[41:42.960 --> 41:45.620]  But it was, I want to see the movie very badly too.
[41:45.800 --> 41:48.100]  And I even said to Eric, I was like, oh, we should add this.
[41:48.100 --> 41:51.120]  We should add this to the list of movies we need to watch.
[41:51.260 --> 41:54.640]  And he looked at me like, he could have killed me with his eyes in that moment.
[41:54.740 --> 41:55.260]  I think he would have.
[41:55.880 --> 41:57.360]  What if we do a week of movies?
[41:57.760 --> 41:59.020]  What if that's what we use in office?
[41:59.020 --> 42:01.260]  Because we can't schedule a day of movie.
[42:01.940 --> 42:03.960]  No, but what if we just do an office?
[42:04.100 --> 42:05.680]  One of our office days, we just watch movies.
[42:06.060 --> 42:06.400]  That's true.
[42:06.860 --> 42:08.420]  That was what we were going to do, wasn't it?
[42:08.540 --> 42:12.860]  But the next office day has to get rescheduled because Geoff is out of town.
[42:13.080 --> 42:13.920]  That's my fault.
[42:14.060 --> 42:14.680]  That's on me.
[42:15.220 --> 42:15.460]  Okay.
[42:15.460 --> 42:18.580]  I also told you guys about that at least a month ago.
[42:18.840 --> 42:19.260]  That's true.
[42:19.380 --> 42:20.460]  It's not like a new surprise.
[42:21.380 --> 42:22.520]  I've known about that for a while.
[42:22.960 --> 42:27.500]  I think when we decided to do the first one and we scheduled them,
[42:27.580 --> 42:29.680]  I said, I'm going to have to cancel the second one immediately.
[42:31.560 --> 42:32.660]  Oh my god!
[42:32.660 --> 42:33.580]  It's about a dog's head.
[42:33.640 --> 42:34.840]  Is that from the movie?
[42:35.840 --> 42:36.500]  That's bingo.
[42:37.540 --> 42:38.260]  Oh no!
[42:38.420 --> 42:39.780]  We got to see this movie!
[42:40.400 --> 42:41.880]  Oh my god!
[42:42.340 --> 42:42.800]  It's a comedy.
[42:44.220 --> 42:45.240]  It's funny, right?
[42:45.240 --> 42:47.160]  This is a kid's film, right?
[42:49.760 --> 42:52.340]  Is that a picture of bingo in court?
[42:54.060 --> 42:55.700]  It's paws on the Bible!
[43:01.140 --> 43:02.060]  Oh my god.
[43:02.540 --> 43:04.580]  You don't have the bingo can't do it, do you, Eric?
[43:04.680 --> 43:07.120]  I've been looking the whole time for it.
[43:07.180 --> 43:08.400]  I'm looking so hard, man.
[43:08.420 --> 43:10.180]  I want to put that on a shirt so bad.
[43:10.360 --> 43:12.120]  Yeah, I think we talked about it.
[43:12.180 --> 43:14.020]  I think we probably just could, right?
[43:14.660 --> 43:16.920]  I mean, you know, ask for forgiveness.
[43:17.380 --> 43:17.740]  Right.
[43:18.480 --> 43:22.380]  Man, I've been trying to find bingo can't do it, and it is just, it's a tough one.
[43:22.820 --> 43:25.380]  You get a bunch of bingo cards. I just tried myself. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:26.180 --> 43:26.860]  Oh my god.
[43:27.180 --> 43:29.360]  I feel like if you illegally make bingo merchandise,
[43:29.620 --> 43:31.800]  that guy with the gun is the guy who's coming for you.
[43:32.000 --> 43:35.020]  Like, I don't know who else would pursue you in the bingo universe.
[43:36.980 --> 43:40.720]  Well, you know, let's keep bingo out there in the periphery,
[43:40.720 --> 43:44.740]  and maybe if we do a movie week or if we have some extra time after Monkey Movie,
[43:44.840 --> 43:45.880]  maybe we could slot that in.
[43:45.980 --> 43:49.640]  I feel like there was another movie we wanted to watch about a...
[43:49.640 --> 43:49.980]  Oh, um...
[43:49.980 --> 43:51.980]  Was it like a George C. Scott movie or something?
[43:52.620 --> 43:54.180]  Day of the Pelican or something?
[43:54.420 --> 43:59.820]  No, it was the football one, the football action movie.
[44:00.640 --> 44:01.880]  Oh, Last Boy Scout?
[44:02.580 --> 44:03.620]  Yeah, we talked about that.
[44:03.620 --> 44:05.320]  Yeah, we should do that one, too. We should definitely do that.
[44:06.460 --> 44:06.720]  That's a fun one.
[44:06.720 --> 44:08.180]  We're gonna have a great movie day one day.
[44:08.860 --> 44:09.460]  I can't wait.
[44:09.460 --> 44:10.760]  It's gonna be fantastic.
[44:11.380 --> 44:15.080]  I have to ask, because now the deadline was moved again,
[44:15.340 --> 44:17.620]  is the Banana White presentation finished?
[44:18.160 --> 44:22.940]  No, it would have been finished today, but because it got rescheduled, it's not done.
[44:23.440 --> 44:24.880]  80% of it is done.
[44:25.980 --> 44:29.420]  I'm gonna finish it either this week or next week.
[44:29.900 --> 44:34.740]  Now, is it fair to say that it's been rescheduled?
[44:34.920 --> 44:37.480]  I think at this point it's just been descheduled, right?
[44:37.480 --> 44:40.020]  Is it on the books anywhere currently?
[44:40.680 --> 44:41.460]  Let's get it on the books.
[44:41.900 --> 44:43.280]  Okay, when do you want it on the books, guys?
[44:43.880 --> 44:45.200]  All right, let me pull up my calendar.
[44:45.820 --> 44:48.600]  I'll throw out the first date and then we'll go from that.
[44:48.780 --> 44:49.380]  Okay, so let me see.
[44:49.500 --> 44:52.120]  Now I'm doing the same thing next week and then I'm very busy.
[44:52.460 --> 44:52.520]  The 7th.
[44:52.880 --> 44:53.500]  The 10th.
[44:53.520 --> 44:53.720]  Nope.
[44:56.560 --> 44:56.920]  14th.
[44:56.980 --> 45:00.860]  The 7th. I can't do the 14th.
[45:01.580 --> 45:03.340]  How about October?
[45:04.160 --> 45:06.680]  How about October 20th?
[45:06.980 --> 45:07.340]  Can't do it.
[45:07.820 --> 45:08.220]  Oh.
[45:08.420 --> 45:12.140]  October 19th.
[45:15.600 --> 45:17.260]  I can do the 19th.
[45:17.440 --> 45:19.320]  All right, let's do it.
[45:19.580 --> 45:19.860]  19th?
[45:19.880 --> 45:20.740]  We doing the 19th?
[45:20.980 --> 45:21.900]  Let's do the 19th.
[45:21.980 --> 45:22.380]  What time?
[45:23.500 --> 45:24.100]  1 p.m.
[45:25.100 --> 45:25.500]  Ooh.
[45:26.680 --> 45:27.360]  No, I'm just kidding.
[45:30.300 --> 45:32.120]  It's 11 Pacific, 1 p.m.
[45:32.820 --> 45:33.660]  Yeah, how's that work for y'all?
[45:33.700 --> 45:34.040]  Is that okay?
[45:34.220 --> 45:34.620]  Fantastic.
[45:34.780 --> 45:35.240]  Sounds great.
[45:35.400 --> 45:36.460]  Put it in the books.
[45:37.340 --> 45:39.300]  There you go, the 90th time.
[45:40.400 --> 45:40.980]  It's in the books.
[45:41.820 --> 45:42.120]  All right.
[45:42.500 --> 45:43.980]  And banana wipes will be done?
[45:44.580 --> 45:47.740]  Banana wipes will be done by then, as long as the technology is available.
[45:47.940 --> 45:53.040]  We just lost all of my Office, all my Windows applications are currently gone.
[45:53.280 --> 45:53.820]  Oh, no.
[45:54.820 --> 45:56.140]  Is that what you were telling us?
[45:56.160 --> 45:58.260]  Is that you'd lost the monkey presentation?
[45:58.880 --> 46:03.800]  No, I haven't started putting in any of the slides yet, but I got the script laid out.
[46:03.800 --> 46:04.940]  80% done, guys.
[46:04.940 --> 46:05.820]  80%?
[46:05.960 --> 46:07.880]  Well, that's the easy part. It's just you drop the photos in.
[46:07.960 --> 46:09.360]  I got the photos in. I got the script.
[46:09.660 --> 46:12.480]  I'm emailing Zeus. I'm doing everything that I need to do.
[46:12.800 --> 46:14.840]  He's like, I'm 80% of the way done.
[46:14.940 --> 46:17.780]  I have all the puzzle pieces. I just got to put them together real fast.
[46:17.960 --> 46:18.140]  Yeah.
[46:18.220 --> 46:21.240]  I'm excited for the 18th of October when you start working on this again.
[46:21.600 --> 46:25.600]  No, it's going to get kicked fully back into gear next week.
[46:27.200 --> 46:29.280]  Did you say you're emailing Zeus?
[46:30.020 --> 46:30.600]  That's fine.
[46:31.500 --> 46:34.580]  Anyway, I had to rewatch it again, and I'm going to do the script.
[46:34.580 --> 46:38.660]  I've seen this movie like five times now. Don't want to watch it again.
[46:39.040 --> 46:43.080]  I enjoy it. I don't enjoy it that much. I was never a huge MVP guy.
[46:43.320 --> 46:48.060]  Loved MVP 2. That was the thing, which I've only seen two times, maybe.
[46:48.700 --> 46:50.720]  It's a great discrepancy in my watches.
[46:51.100 --> 46:55.560]  Do you think this has improved your opinion of MVP or worsened it?
[46:55.840 --> 47:02.020]  I think what's fascinating about this is I have rewatched the first five minutes of MVP 2
[47:02.020 --> 47:07.140]  within the last year, and it has nothing to do with what MVP has to do.
[47:07.560 --> 47:11.360]  So really, I'm recapping a movie for context that there is none for MVP 2.
[47:11.720 --> 47:15.100]  You're not going to take anything away. It's sort of a pointless endeavor,
[47:15.420 --> 47:18.700]  summarizing MVP 1 for the purpose of going into MVP 2.
[47:19.020 --> 47:20.680]  They don't connect in any way.
[47:21.080 --> 47:24.360]  If we didn't already have Deep Lore About Nothing,
[47:24.520 --> 47:29.160]  I would nominate it's sort of a pointless endeavor as the tagline for this podcast.
[47:29.680 --> 47:30.500]  It's a great tagline.
[47:30.500 --> 47:30.920]  Yeah.
[47:32.400 --> 47:33.960]  Deep Lore About Nothing is way better, though.
[47:34.540 --> 47:39.100]  It also describes Gavin's ability to become friendly with another British person.
[47:39.260 --> 47:40.260]  It's a pointless endeavor.
[47:40.900 --> 47:41.260]  Totem in the hole!
[47:44.240 --> 47:46.760]  I'm genuinely excited for Totem in the Hole. It's going to be great.
[47:48.220 --> 47:48.980]  Oh, man.
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.420]  We need to do the chip thing, too. That also has to go on the schedule.
[47:51.820 --> 47:54.920]  Can I include... I've been wondering about this.
[47:55.040 --> 47:59.180]  Can a corn-based snack be in the rotation? Does it have to be a chip?
[47:59.700 --> 48:02.920]  Uh, well, like a Bugle?
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.340]  Yeah, Bugle is the one I was thinking more as you made fun of them.
[48:08.440 --> 48:13.600]  You mocked one of Canada's great snacks as saying it looks like carnival food, the Cheezys.
[48:14.660 --> 48:20.280]  I would like to submit the Cheezys because I do feel it is an iconic staple of Canadian snacking.
[48:20.340 --> 48:21.700]  Is that made by Utz?
[48:22.280 --> 48:24.680]  It's not made by Utz. It's made by Hawkins.
[48:26.220 --> 48:27.180]  Different companies.
[48:27.180 --> 48:30.760]  Dude, the whole reason I went to Walmart was to get those Utz cheese balls
[48:30.760 --> 48:34.240]  because it was the only brand I could find called Utz and they said they carried them.
[48:35.620 --> 48:38.360]  Uh, I don't know, man. I don't know.
[48:38.540 --> 48:44.820]  Maybe we need to have like a separate category for non-chip-based flavors.
[48:45.460 --> 48:48.480]  Here's the thing, though. If we do that, we're never going to do that category.
[48:48.740 --> 48:51.180]  We're only going to do the chip snack thing once.
[48:51.240 --> 48:53.240]  So we're not doing multiple iterations of it, I don't think.
[48:53.280 --> 48:54.380]  So it just will never be included.
[48:54.940 --> 48:56.000]  How are we doing that?
[48:57.440 --> 48:58.060]  What do you mean?
[48:58.260 --> 48:59.160]  Is that an in-person thing?
[48:59.720 --> 49:02.900]  No, I think we all submit... I think it could be like the Apple review.
[49:03.040 --> 49:06.900]  I think we all submit three flavors that come from our country
[49:07.380 --> 49:09.680]  and then we have them and review them at the time.
[49:10.280 --> 49:12.340]  Yeah, there's no way I can narrow it down to three.
[49:12.680 --> 49:16.200]  Well, you got, what, Snack Attack, Build-A-Snack, like everything.
[49:17.040 --> 49:20.520]  Yeah, you got a tough lineup. I feel like it's very definitive for me.
[49:21.400 --> 49:22.040]  Fuzzy Wizzles.
[49:24.980 --> 49:25.620]  Zippy Zazoos.
[49:25.620 --> 49:28.720]  I mean, I'm also, I'm scouting. I don't think I talked about it before.
[49:29.380 --> 49:33.340]  Did I show you the KFC chips that Canada just got?
[49:33.840 --> 49:34.120]  No.
[49:35.180 --> 49:37.460]  KFC is doing a brand of Ruffles.
[49:38.160 --> 49:39.260]  Only for Canada?
[49:39.700 --> 49:40.760]  Only for Canada.
[49:41.100 --> 49:42.500]  Because Kentucky is in my country.
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.140]  Yeah, it's a strange choice by them.
[49:46.760 --> 49:48.080]  Here, put it in the chat.
[49:48.540 --> 49:49.660]  Oh, you beat me to it already.
[49:50.040 --> 49:51.540]  Yeah, so I've been doing my scouting.
[49:51.540 --> 49:56.620]  Original Recipe Chicken, KFC slash PFK, which is the French version, KFC.
[49:57.220 --> 49:59.280]  They're just chicken chips. I was very disappointed.
[49:59.480 --> 50:03.180]  There's nothing Kentucky Fried Chicken flavor really about them.
[50:03.500 --> 50:06.600]  I don't think I've ever had a chicken chip.
[50:06.960 --> 50:07.300]  Really?
[50:07.840 --> 50:10.680]  Yeah, chicken's not a flavor for potato chips in America.
[50:11.160 --> 50:15.440]  It's not all that common either in Canada, but it sometimes appears.
[50:15.720 --> 50:17.540]  It's more of, I do it as like a British flavor.
[50:17.980 --> 50:20.780]  Yeah, there's a lot of roast chicken walkers and all that.
[50:20.780 --> 50:22.840]  You fan of a chicken chip, Gavin?
[50:23.200 --> 50:24.460]  Yeah, I don't mind it. It's a nice flavor.
[50:24.520 --> 50:25.260]  Good, it's a good chip.
[50:25.900 --> 50:27.880]  Will you be submitting a chicken chip, Gavin?
[50:28.280 --> 50:33.040]  I don't think Walker's Roast Chicken is a unique enough flavor.
[50:33.240 --> 50:35.100]  Like, it's got nothing on frazzles, in my opinion.
[50:36.020 --> 50:37.380]  What the fuck is a frazzle?
[50:37.920 --> 50:39.180]  Well, let's not go down that path again.
[50:39.300 --> 50:39.980]  No, we can't.
[50:43.020 --> 50:44.100]  Oh, man.
[50:44.100 --> 50:50.520]  Yeah, that looks very bland. In my head, a frazzle is like a weird blue shade and it's...
[50:50.520 --> 50:54.360]  That's not... that's the chicken. Yeah, that's frazzles. It's the bacon.
[50:55.020 --> 50:57.520]  That looks like... dude, that looks like a dog treat.
[50:57.760 --> 50:58.820]  It does look like a dog treat.
[50:58.820 --> 51:02.940]  That looks like something I'd give Henry. I'd put a pill... it's got a pill pocket in it.
[51:03.140 --> 51:07.120]  Frazzles are so... it's one of those things, like, I can taste a frazzle in my mouth right now.
[51:07.860 --> 51:11.100]  It's pierced my brain and you can imagine it well.
[51:11.920 --> 51:15.520]  Are you sure you haven't just... you're not just eating frazzles as we speak?
[51:15.820 --> 51:16.920]  No, I don't think I am.
[51:17.420 --> 51:18.700]  Okay, just had to check.
[51:20.140 --> 51:25.040]  And the fun thing about frazzles is if Geoff was in the bingo game with them,
[51:25.080 --> 51:30.180]  they could also be known as razzles, azzles, zullz, zullz, lez, ez, or esses.
[51:31.720 --> 51:38.060]  To be fair, I never went deeper than two letters, so at the most it could have been azzles.
[51:38.480 --> 51:42.120]  And there'd be a... below the actual picture of the crisp would be a thumb.
[51:43.220 --> 51:43.960]  Well, potentially.
[51:44.520 --> 51:46.800]  You said that like it makes you a man of integrity.
[51:46.800 --> 51:51.960]  Like we can all get a board, like we can all join in on editing two letters out, but three?
[51:52.840 --> 51:53.240]  No.
[51:53.620 --> 51:56.780]  Like that was a hard and fast rule. It just happened to be that there wasn't a letter
[51:56.780 --> 51:58.700]  U deeper into the word, otherwise it absolutely...
[51:58.700 --> 52:03.180]  No, I did... that was a hard and fast rule. I kept... I have ethics.
[52:03.880 --> 52:08.920]  Did you at least attempt to find an ugly fruit? Because I really want to know what they taste like
[52:08.920 --> 52:10.620]  and I'm disappointed that we don't know.
[52:10.960 --> 52:13.320]  I did attempt to find one and I did not find one.
[52:13.480 --> 52:15.820]  I've never seen one in any store anywhere.
[52:16.240 --> 52:19.100]  Even if he did find one, we wouldn't have gotten a picture of it.
[52:20.180 --> 52:21.600]  I would have taken a picture of it.
[52:22.200 --> 52:23.100]  I took a picture of everything.
[52:23.900 --> 52:27.020]  I took a... oh, I did. I took a picture of Uchiko. I ate everything in there.
[52:27.220 --> 52:28.320]  Oh, that's gross.
[52:28.320 --> 52:29.300]  It looks like...
[52:29.300 --> 52:29.620]  It's ugly.
[52:30.300 --> 52:35.860]  It looks like an orange cut into a pumpkin for warmth and is living inside the pumpkin.
[52:37.080 --> 52:39.620]  It does. That's a great description, Andrew.
[52:39.900 --> 52:40.760]  It looks terrible.
[52:40.820 --> 52:44.620]  It looks like it... it looks like an orange is eating a pumpkin from the inside out.
[52:46.160 --> 52:46.900]  Parasitic orange.
[52:47.020 --> 52:47.280]  Yeah.
[52:50.000 --> 52:53.180]  If anyone in the audience has had an Ugly Fruit, please let us know.
[52:53.520 --> 52:56.600]  I'd love to know. It just... it looks dry and flavorless.
[52:56.940 --> 52:59.480]  It does. I hear they're quite sweet, though, right?
[52:59.820 --> 53:03.720]  Really? Well, yeah, there's Ugly Pie, which has nothing to do with Ugly Fruit.
[53:03.840 --> 53:04.240]  It's just like...
[53:04.240 --> 53:06.920]  I didn't find any of that either. I did find the Upside Down Burger, though.
[53:07.400 --> 53:10.780]  You did. Some might say you created it.
[53:11.220 --> 53:16.180]  You... like, find to me implies that, like, somebody else did it and you uncovered it.
[53:16.300 --> 53:18.100]  Well, I created... I created this whole segment, so...
[53:18.580 --> 53:20.200]  In that sense, you're sure. I guess I did.
[53:22.660 --> 53:26.240]  Did we ever go through Geoff's pictures and, like, read out what he actually ate?
[53:26.720 --> 53:28.560]  No. I just assumed all of it.
[53:29.140 --> 53:29.940]  Because... yeah.
[53:30.040 --> 53:32.560]  Oh, but, like, what they were. What they actually were.
[53:32.800 --> 53:35.640]  Oh, I felt like they were all pretty obvious products.
[53:36.020 --> 53:38.400]  Well, just in case. Let's see.
[53:38.400 --> 53:43.500]  It looks like sandwiches, cheese balls, waffles, mac and cheese.
[53:44.140 --> 53:51.800]  Burger, burrito, Nutty Buddy, Gushers, Stuffed Crust Pizza, Crunch and Munch,
[53:52.200 --> 53:53.740]  and Muncho's Potato Chips.
[53:53.860 --> 53:56.140]  Oh, and Upcake was actually a cupcake.
[53:56.380 --> 53:56.880]  Okay.
[54:00.220 --> 54:01.820]  But it had a little football on it.
[54:02.300 --> 54:05.640]  Would you ever do that again, Geoff, as the creator of this bet?
[54:05.640 --> 54:09.000]  Oh, yeah, I loved it. I had a blast doing it.
[54:09.340 --> 54:10.240]  You'd do it again?
[54:10.920 --> 54:12.260]  I would do it again in a second, yeah.
[54:13.240 --> 54:17.580]  Does the letters that exist make you less willing at all?
[54:17.680 --> 54:21.140]  Like, the U is out, so nobody can get a U, but the P is gone, too.
[54:21.980 --> 54:24.960]  I feel like there's a lot of easy letters in there.
[54:25.440 --> 54:26.060]  You think so?
[54:26.340 --> 54:27.000]  I think so.
[54:27.400 --> 54:28.120]  B would be easy.
[54:28.660 --> 54:29.820]  B would be phenomenal.
[54:30.040 --> 54:31.020]  B is a great one.
[54:31.300 --> 54:34.020]  Yeah. But C would be good.
[54:34.760 --> 54:35.740]  What do you got with C?
[54:36.980 --> 54:37.420]  Chicken.
[54:38.060 --> 54:39.160]  That's a great one.
[54:39.440 --> 54:42.400]  Done. Cheese. Cheese. Chicken.
[54:43.180 --> 54:44.120]  Oh, that sounds delicious.
[54:46.240 --> 54:48.940]  Churro. Fuck, dude, I could just eat churros for four days.
[54:49.460 --> 54:49.840]  Chod.
[54:50.820 --> 54:53.620]  This is a question that I feel like is less impactful for Geoff.
[54:53.960 --> 54:57.260]  But what was the food you missed the most, Gavin, when you were doing your thing?
[54:58.440 --> 55:00.160]  I didn't really miss any food.
[55:00.160 --> 55:05.220]  Really, you're weird with food. You're not a big food. You don't enjoy food.
[55:05.480 --> 55:07.160]  There's no joy in it for you.
[55:07.460 --> 55:10.220]  No, I'm always excited to be done eating.
[55:11.600 --> 55:13.540]  When I sit down, I'm like, let's get this over with.
[55:13.800 --> 55:16.880]  The same with sleeping. Like, when it's night time, I'm just annoyed.
[55:18.060 --> 55:20.520]  I'm just excited about it being bright again.
[55:21.000 --> 55:25.500]  No, that's fair. Because night time to you means you're inflating your stomach with air.
[55:25.740 --> 55:29.220]  Like, you have a different relationship for sleep.
[55:29.780 --> 55:32.260]  Like, it gets to the point where it's like 11 and I'm tired.
[55:32.360 --> 55:36.800]  I'm like, oh, I just want to skip to the bit where I've got energy again and the sun's up.
[55:37.300 --> 55:40.560]  I totally agree with you, buddy. I have started going to bed at nine o'clock
[55:41.260 --> 55:43.120]  p.m. Maybe that's just my age.
[55:43.200 --> 55:48.020]  But I'd much rather be awake at five in the morning than awake at midnight.
[55:48.400 --> 55:48.540]  Yeah.
[55:48.760 --> 55:52.060]  Are you still backed up, Gavin? Has that ever resolved?
[55:52.700 --> 55:54.160]  Now that we've done this food challenge?
[55:54.160 --> 55:59.780]  Yeah, I've got to reset my gut, I think, because I had a bad gut after travel.
[55:59.960 --> 56:03.040]  I was a bit stopped up after landing back in the U.S.
[56:03.380 --> 56:07.640]  And I poured a bunch of weird food all over it, like Godzilla rolls and gumbo.
[56:08.240 --> 56:10.960]  And I'll be honest, I've had a lot of heartburn.
[56:11.800 --> 56:12.400]  Oh, no.
[56:12.740 --> 56:15.380]  The gumbo was mad heartburn for me.
[56:15.480 --> 56:20.620]  With the heartburn, could you relate to me saying I've never felt more mortal?
[56:21.360 --> 56:23.600]  When you have bad heartburn, it brings you down.
[56:23.600 --> 56:24.800]  It's a terrible feeling.
[56:25.060 --> 56:29.460]  Yeah, the worst part of it is it felt like my whole throat was like a little bit acidic.
[56:29.840 --> 56:33.740]  And then whenever I drank my sparkling grapefruit, it felt funny.
[56:35.880 --> 56:39.640]  I really think you need to try to push everything out with the CPAP machine.
[56:39.780 --> 56:41.440]  I know I suggested it in the past.
[56:41.800 --> 56:46.480]  I just think like turning your body into like a toothpaste dispenser
[56:46.480 --> 56:51.160]  to try to like get things out, I think would be funny if it works.
[56:51.160 --> 56:55.020]  The last, you know, when a pump is running a little dry and it starts sputtering,
[56:55.200 --> 56:57.680]  the last thing I want is my anus doing that in the night.
[56:58.000 --> 56:59.620]  That seems like nightmare fuel.
[57:00.700 --> 57:01.940]  Oh, God.
[57:05.880 --> 57:07.220]  Oh, that's terrible.
[57:08.160 --> 57:08.800]  This is nice.
[57:14.080 --> 57:17.720]  I think I broke my finger the other day.
[57:18.140 --> 57:18.840]  What do you mean?
[57:19.600 --> 57:22.300]  I think my finger might be broken.
[57:22.600 --> 57:27.320]  And my ankle, I realized recently, it just has not been right since the bike wreck.
[57:27.400 --> 57:28.400]  All right, let's get some percentages.
[57:29.060 --> 57:30.260]  Yeah, Pit Boy is out.
[57:31.900 --> 57:33.400]  My knee is like 100%.
[57:34.100 --> 57:38.120]  I would say my ankle is at like, I thought it was at like 85%.
[57:38.120 --> 57:39.540]  I think it's more like 60.
[57:40.100 --> 57:43.260]  I can't put pressure on it in certain directions still.
[57:43.340 --> 57:44.080]  And it's real tight.
[57:44.620 --> 57:47.340]  Now, do you have an issue where like when you lift your...
[57:47.340 --> 57:49.540]  does it sometimes just pop out for you a little bit?
[57:49.620 --> 57:51.260]  Like you have to like slide it back in?
[57:51.420 --> 57:51.500]  Okay.
[57:51.680 --> 57:53.140]  No, no, I don't have that issue.
[57:53.860 --> 57:57.260]  And then, but my finger the other day, I was... we went to the grocery store.
[57:57.320 --> 57:58.560]  This is about three weeks ago now.
[57:58.760 --> 58:01.880]  And we went to the grocery store and I was bringing groceries in,
[58:02.060 --> 58:04.920]  plastic grocery bags, and I just picked up a bunch of grocery bags
[58:04.920 --> 58:06.560]  with my left and right hand.
[58:06.920 --> 58:10.300]  And my, I guess like all the weight from a bunch of bags
[58:10.300 --> 58:12.080]  just ended up on my right index finger.
[58:12.080 --> 58:17.240]  And it bent wrong and hurt very sharply and very weird.
[58:17.680 --> 58:19.340]  And then it snapped back into place real fast.
[58:19.420 --> 58:21.320]  And I thought like, oh, maybe I sprained it or whatever.
[58:21.880 --> 58:23.820]  But then it got real swollen for a while.
[58:24.120 --> 58:25.780]  And then it's fine again now.
[58:26.140 --> 58:28.260]  But if I push on it in the wrong direction,
[58:28.560 --> 58:30.180]  it hurts so bad I almost pass out.
[58:30.340 --> 58:30.980]  So I think...
[58:30.980 --> 58:31.540]  Oh my God.
[58:31.900 --> 58:34.560]  I mean, first off, I'm just not gonna push on it in that direction anymore.
[58:34.660 --> 58:36.820]  But I'm wondering, I mean, I can still bend it and stuff.
[58:37.140 --> 58:38.880]  But it doesn't feel right.
[58:38.920 --> 58:40.080]  Like it should hurt like that.
[58:40.080 --> 58:42.780]  And be so blaringly painful.
[58:44.780 --> 58:46.960]  But it's my right hand and I'm left-handed.
[58:47.060 --> 58:48.320]  So I'm not super concerned.
[58:48.820 --> 58:52.000]  Is this gonna impact your potential swing in the future?
[58:52.360 --> 58:53.440]  I don't know.
[58:53.780 --> 58:56.180]  I am a little concerned about that.
[58:56.380 --> 59:01.680]  But we don't really have any baseballs coming up in the immediate future.
[59:02.160 --> 59:04.660]  And the next time we do it, I'll be sharing the wealth with everybody else.
[59:04.920 --> 59:08.080]  Yeah, it just brings me joy knowing that you can hit dingers.
[59:08.080 --> 59:12.080]  And it would be sad to me if you have lost any ability to do so.
[59:12.080 --> 59:12.940]  I know, it's just, I know.
[59:13.160 --> 59:14.640]  It's me and Aaron Judge, right?
[59:14.800 --> 59:15.980]  Just fucking cranking it.
[59:16.520 --> 59:18.540]  I'm really worried about hitting baseballs, by the way.
[59:19.060 --> 59:19.240]  Why?
[59:19.300 --> 59:19.420]  Why?
[59:20.000 --> 59:21.620]  Because Geoff makes it look really easy.
[59:21.840 --> 59:24.300]  And the more I watch him do it, the more I think, oh, I could just do that.
[59:25.240 --> 59:25.960]  I don't...
[59:25.960 --> 59:28.400]  I think everyone's gonna make fun of me.
[59:29.300 --> 59:30.400]  Well, that'll happen regardless.
[59:30.940 --> 59:32.180]  Yeah, that's a guarantee.
[59:32.480 --> 59:32.740]  Yeah.
[59:33.180 --> 59:33.280]  Yeah.
[59:33.460 --> 59:36.240]  When we went to hit baseballs the last time, I asked Geoff if...
[59:36.240 --> 59:39.300]  if he thought you could hit these baseballs.
[59:39.400 --> 59:41.120]  And I said, maybe Gavin's a secret athlete.
[59:41.320 --> 59:44.660]  And then you walked over to us and almost just fell walking over.
[59:45.280 --> 59:45.340]  Yeah.
[59:45.920 --> 59:48.360]  You did like a pratfall in front of us.
[59:48.840 --> 59:54.500]  Was that before or after you picked up the paint to throw away and left a trail all across the park?
[59:59.280 --> 01:00:04.080]  There's like a line of paint going out the door over a freaking table of chairs.
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:05.880]  All across.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.840]  It went up the trash can and into the trash.
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:11.460]  It was like a cartoon.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.320]  Did we get a picture of that?
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:16.380]  I don't know.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.460]  Maybe I did. Let me see.
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:20.720]  It was fucking funny though.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:24.920]  I will say Gavin can be a little bit of a freak athlete.
[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:29.020]  Going back to the time we went to pinballs that Gavin doesn't remember.
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:33.820]  We played one of those games where you have to like throw the ball at the target.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:39.040]  And Gavin had by far the worst form of throwing a ball I've ever seen.
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:41.420]  Yet he somehow could hit them constantly.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.360]  He had incredible accuracy.
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:44.980]  It just looked horrendous.
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:49.580]  So I could see a similar situation where your swing is terrible, but you hit it pretty far.
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:55.220]  I'm kind of like that with bowling too, where I swing like outwards to the point where
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:00.840]  physics just sends my body at like 45 degrees the other way and it looks like I'm gonna fall.
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:04.640]  And then the weight of the ball like reasserts me to the center and I get a strike.
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:05.800]  Like I don't even really know.
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:11.140]  I'm imagining that you going to roll the ball looks like a like a giant clock,
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:14.340]  you know, like the pendulum, like the ball just goes left and right.
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:15.320]  And then somehow you strike.
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.120]  Oh, strike.
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:20.500]  Oh, you know what? I don't have any photos of it,
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.280]  but I do have a photo of something that I built.
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:24.820]  Can I show you guys something that I made last weekend?
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:25.340]  I would love to see it.
[01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:28.060]  I was trying to think of like why I don't have anything to talk about this week.
[01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:34.620]  And then I realized I spent probably 25 hours from Friday night to Sunday night making something.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.420]  And I'm very, very proud of it.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.040]  I want to show you guys.
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.880]  Let me see if I can send this to you right now.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:40.720]  If you don't mind.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:41.680]  Completely forgot.
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:42.540]  This isn't funny or anything.
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:43.480]  I just want to share it with.
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.000]  No, I want to.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:44.520]  I'm excited.
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.920]  Um, I was really, I was really proud of it.
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:48.360]  Uh, let's see.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.440]  It's going to be Geoff showing his asshole to us.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:53.480]  After this weekend.
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:56.420]  25 hours on this.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.600]  Oh, that's so cool.
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:01:59.460]  I made it.
[01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:01.020]  That's my Halloween tiny town.
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:01.480]  Yeah.
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:01.920]  Yeah.
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:02.680]  That's so sweet.
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:09.140]  So what that is, is that's a, it's a, it's a circular table of a 48 inch circular table.
[01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:15.220]  And on top of it, I've put down a layer of foam that I cut and then painted and glued grass to.
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.860]  And then on top of that, I built with foam.
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:23.100]  I carved a mountain, uh, with like steps going up and then I painted and grasped it all.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:28.000]  And then I built, uh, like a little city for all of our little Halloween village.
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:29.120]  That looks so cool.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:29.780]  Did you buy the houses?
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:31.180]  The houses are bought.
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:31.400]  Yeah.
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.080]  I've been buying, we've been buying those over time.
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:34.720]  That's, that looks amazing.
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.820]  I forgot how hard you go on, on Halloween.
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:37.860]  I don't fuck around.
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:38.120]  Right?
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:39.800]  So this is how it started.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:44.520]  Could you, could you please pull a Gavin's, uh, when Geoff said that he bought the house,
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:49.260]  the, the, the tone of disappointment and zero respect given was incredible.
[01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:51.680]  You always misinterpret my oath.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:52.380]  No, no.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.480]  You're listening to my oaths wrong.
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:56.800]  I'm gonna have to hear it back to see if you're right.
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:57.580]  We'll run it back.
[01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:59.900]  See, it went, it started like that.
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:02.340]  And then you can see like, that's how I planned it out.
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:06.980]  And then, uh, and then I, and then I carved it like that.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.840]  And then I built, and then I just slowly painted it and put it all together.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:10.720]  It was so much fun.
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:11.580]  And Emily did a lot too.
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.780]  She did a lot of the finer work, but I did all the, like the assembly.
[01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:17.220]  And did that give you the joy of what you get?
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:18.940]  Like the relaxation of riding your bike?
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.440]  Was it quite therapeutic to me that?
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:21.540]  It was fun.
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:24.060]  I mean, I was stressed the fuck out for a lot of it.
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:25.000]  It was pretty overwhelming.
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:28.980]  But ultimately, yes, it was, it was a really fun experience.
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:30.880]  And I was very proud of how it turned out.
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:31.520]  It looks so cool.
[01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:32.000]  It's awesome.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:32.440]  Thank you so much.
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:35.360]  Emily did a wonderful job in putting that together.
[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:37.520]  It's a great festive vibe.
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:39.980]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:42.100]  Wait, what's Eric talking about?
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:46.240]  This is cool because Geoff's other podcast co-host wasn't so stoked when he saw it.
[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.000]  Yeah, I showed it to Gus.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:04:00.060]  Gus yelled at me for wasting time and money on something so stupid and frivolous as getting
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:01.160]  excited about a holiday.
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:06.500]  He was like, it was exactly, exactly what I expected to hear.
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.600]  That, you know, you just reminded me of something, Gavin.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.580]  You're still my alert noise on my phone.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:15.620]  You're, oh, oh no, is my alert noise.
[01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:18.120]  I just have my phone muted most of the time.
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:18.680]  So I don't know.
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.780]  I was going to say, how does your partner feel about that?
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.560]  So it's, well, that's not the issue.
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:24.460]  They think it's very funny.
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:29.820]  What the problem is, is we had, it was our unit was inspected recently.
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:33.680]  And so I'm sitting there and I'm just like going about my day and I had my alerts on,
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.360]  which was unusual.
[01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:38.520]  And then I realized without context, this sounds horrible.
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:40.280]  I'm just in a room by myself.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.560]  They don't know what it is.
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:44.660]  They just keep hearing a person going, oh, oh no.
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:45.900]  Oh, oh no.
[01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.840]  I was getting like all these texts at once.
[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:50.560]  And it was just somebody, I was like, oh, this, I had to mute my phone.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:51.180]  I was panicking.
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:52.900]  I accidentally turned it louder than it was.
[01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:53.720]  It was terrible.
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:59.420]  I was so anxious of just them hearing you go, oh, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.580]  Why does your place always get inspected?
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:03.580]  Hasn't been inspected in like eight months.
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:04.740]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:05.360]  That's quite a lot.
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:05.980]  That's quite frequent.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:06.520]  That's pretty often.
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:07.420]  Is it?
[01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:07.880]  Okay.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:09.320]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:09.720]  Yeah.
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:12.240]  Maybe we just don't have safety in America.
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.260]  We just don't inspect stuff.
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:20.100]  Uh, do you remember Gavin when my ringtone used to be the porn stars?
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:21.560]  Oh no.
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.680]  There was this porn star on the Howard Stern show one time.
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:27.320]  He ended up dating Robin Quivers briefly, apparently.
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:28.500]  His name was Nick Manning.
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:30.580]  And he, uh, don't look this stuff up, by the way.
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.420]  But anyway, he was trying to come up with catchphrases.
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:38.280]  He, uh, he thought like porn, he thought like porn dudes needed catchphrases.
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:42.200]  So he had, uh, he had some pretty nasty catchphrases.
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:46.120]  And I turned, I would always set my ringtone to one of them.
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:47.500]  So, cause I thought that would be funny.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.260]  And, uh, and then I thought it'd be like, it's, you know,
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.440]  honestly, it was trying to face myself, right?
[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:53.220]  Like, forget about it.
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:55.520]  Put myself in a situation where I have to walk my way out of it.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:06:00.960]  Uh, the worst time it happened was in my daughter's fourth grade, uh, parent teacher.
[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:01.660]  Oh no.
[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:07.000]  My phone rang and all you could hear from my pocket was some dude yelling wet cunt.
[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:08.540]  Oh no.
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:09.580]  Yeah.
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:10.240]  Yeah.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.620]  And that wasn't even the one that got the worst reaction from people.
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:17.040]  At some point you had like the middle of some punk song.
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.280]  Oh, Bikini Kill song.
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:21.460]  Yeah. Where it's just a woman screaming.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.000]  Like as if she's being murdered.
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:28.060]  It's, it was, and it got every single person in every building to turn their head.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:31.380]  It was, I used to have to look the other way whenever you got a call in public.
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.280]  I actually embarrassing.
[01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:35.940]  I've held onto that one. I still put it in a lot.
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:39.080]  So when I, when I'm, when I'm feeling a little young again,
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:42.000]  like I want to face myself, I'll throw that one in.
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:44.420]  I won't do the porn ones anymore. He had another one.
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.600]  He went, he had another one that just said dropping loads.
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:50.160]  And that was my ringtone for a while too.
[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:52.140]  Uh, but yeah, there you go.
[01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:53.320]  Uh, dropping loads.
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:57.340]  Uh, but yeah, now I, I just have a regular ringtone most of the time,
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:59.380]  but sometimes I do that Bikini Kill song still.
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:01.740]  That Bikini Kill song was so bad.
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:05.040]  It was, it's so much worse than you could imagine.
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:08.400]  My favorite Manning brother.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.740]  Nick Manning.
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.520]  I'd love to imagine they're all part of the same family.
[01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:16.600]  The Manning cast would be very different.
[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.720]  That apple fell very far from that tree.
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:23.580]  Uh, okay.
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:27.340]  Well, uh, that was, uh, that was quite an episode.
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:28.780]  I really enjoyed this one.
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:29.320]  Yeah.
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:29.880]  You never know.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.040]  You never know what to expect when you do back-to-backs with the show, you know?
[01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:33.880]  Yeah, totally.
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.740]  Uh, but, uh, guys, I don't get it.
[01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:39.040]  You guys always say that and they're always good.
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:44.220]  Like, I don't, like, I'm, I'm just speaking up because I'm sick of hearing you guys going,
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:44.840]  yeah, I don't know.
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:46.380]  A second episode is always pretty crazy.
[01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:48.200]  You never know if it's going to be good or bad.
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:49.060]  It's not bad.
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.060]  I usually use up my list in the first one.
[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.180]  So it's always a bit of an unknown.
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:53.320]  It is, yeah.
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.040]  It's the same for me.
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:57.840]  I always have a plan for how the podcast is going to go and I have notes for it.
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:07:59.380]  And then I blow through them invariably.
[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:02.320]  And then, uh, and then so the second episode is just wide open.
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:04.220]  So that's why I mean, like, we never know.
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.620]  I never feel like we have bad second episodes.
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:07.480]  They're always good.
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:09.480]  So, well, we did a few, but we deleted them.
[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:11.880]  So we just don't talk about those.
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:12.420]  Great.
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:12.720]  Thanks.
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:14.920]  That's not true.
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:15.560]  I made that up.
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.520]  We didn't delete any episodes.
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:18.020]  Nick is like, we did?
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:25.580]  I'm excited for you two to hear the thing I recorded with Eric and Nick.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:26.600]  That'll be fun.
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:27.780]  I'm excited to hear that too.
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:27.960]  Yeah.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:28.740]  When can I hear that?
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.360]  No idea.
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:30.600]  We can send it to you shortly.
[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:32.900]  But what we have to do first is end this episode.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:33.540]  Okay.

[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.300]  All right, goodbye.
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:02.620]  No, goodbye.
[01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:03.220]  No.
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:05.920]  But you didn't say this is season five.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.940]  You didn't say this is season five!
[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:09.820]  You ended it!
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.500]  It's taking so long for it to get a number.
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:20.240]  He has plenty.
[01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:21.440]  He could have been filming from the next apartment over.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:22.060]  There's so much time.
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:23.640]  Like, so much time to get a number.
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.300]  He could walk to the piss alley and film from there.
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:27.140]  You've got to be kidding me.
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:31.260]  He could have taken a shower, dried off, put pants on, and come back in the room.
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.520]  This can't be real.
[01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:33.760]  It's not.
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:35.080]  How is it real?
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:35.580]  Get the f*** out of here!
[01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:37.340]  This motherf***er.
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:39.600]  Bye!
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:47.540]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.640]  Gavin and Geoff are coming in hot.
[01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:51.260]  How did we miss the pencils?
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.360]  Slow Mo Dan isn't happy.
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:55.480]  Nick finally asked for Nitro.
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:57.280]  It's the San Diego goose.
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:59.060]  How is Geoff's crotch doing?
[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:02.860]  Panton is finally reminded of all the open challenges he has.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:04.820]  Is it time for Brazilian waxing?
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.640]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:10.660]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
