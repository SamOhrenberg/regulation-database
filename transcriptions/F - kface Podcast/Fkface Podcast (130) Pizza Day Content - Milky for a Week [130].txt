[00:15.730 --> 00:19.210]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the... I didn't like that.
[00:19.470 --> 00:22.690]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:22.930 --> 00:25.410]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Payton and Gavin Free.
[00:25.510 --> 00:27.330]  Go ahead and leave in the failed attempt.
[00:27.770 --> 00:30.370]  Just so the audience can see a part of the process.
[00:30.830 --> 00:32.810]  We don't get it right 100% of the time, unfortunately.
[00:33.090 --> 00:35.850]  Even though we are professionals with our 10,000 hours,
[00:35.950 --> 00:37.770]  we do occasionally have lackluster intros.
[00:38.350 --> 00:41.450]  This is 130 times we've done this.
[00:41.870 --> 00:42.690]  How are you guys doing?
[00:42.970 --> 00:43.650]  I'm doing great.
[00:43.770 --> 00:43.810]  Pretty good.
[00:44.290 --> 00:45.310]  Yeah, we're just back to back.
[00:47.010 --> 00:49.210]  Have you guys had pizza since we...
[00:49.210 --> 00:50.830]  I was going to mention that last episode.
[00:50.910 --> 00:52.610]  Last time we talked, we did the pizza.
[00:52.970 --> 00:53.330]  We ate pizza.
[00:54.010 --> 00:54.790]  I haven't had pizza.
[00:55.430 --> 00:56.690]  You haven't had pizza since then.
[00:56.750 --> 00:57.290]  What about you, Gavin?
[00:58.370 --> 00:59.370]  Yes, I did.
[00:59.870 --> 01:00.550]  How did it compare?
[01:00.790 --> 01:01.510]  Did it rank?
[01:01.930 --> 01:02.430]  Was it worse?
[01:02.970 --> 01:03.710]  It was a really, really good pizza.
[01:04.130 --> 01:04.870]  That's unfortunate.
[01:05.370 --> 01:08.690]  I spent literally the rest of that day making little pizzas at my desk.
[01:08.870 --> 01:09.550]  That's all I did.
[01:09.670 --> 01:10.930]  I used all the dough.
[01:10.930 --> 01:12.310]  I made tiny little pizzas all day.
[01:12.390 --> 01:12.850]  It was great.
[01:13.150 --> 01:14.150]  I had a fantastic...
[01:14.150 --> 01:15.990]  With the seven-month expired dough?
[01:16.190 --> 01:17.730]  With the seven-month expired dough.
[01:17.870 --> 01:18.770]  Well, you gotta consume it.
[01:18.790 --> 01:22.110]  Once it's unfrozen, there's no putting a cork on that seven-month bottle.
[01:22.550 --> 01:22.970]  It's gone.
[01:23.870 --> 01:24.390]  Gotta get through it.
[01:25.190 --> 01:26.490]  So, does that...
[01:26.490 --> 01:27.290]  I guess you lived.
[01:27.590 --> 01:28.410]  So, that's good.
[01:28.430 --> 01:28.970]  Yeah, that's fine.
[01:29.070 --> 01:29.830]  Zero issues at all.
[01:29.890 --> 01:30.710]  It's just the yeast died.
[01:30.850 --> 01:31.250]  I didn't.
[01:31.830 --> 01:32.050]  Yeah.
[01:32.710 --> 01:33.030]  Okay.
[01:33.950 --> 01:38.310]  Eric was freaking out that day because I guess we all didn't realize what we were making
[01:38.310 --> 01:40.090]  when he pulled out all the mic equipment.
[01:41.770 --> 01:42.230]  What?
[01:42.810 --> 01:44.690]  What do you mean, we all didn't...
[01:44.690 --> 01:46.270]  Are you saying you didn't realize?
[01:46.570 --> 01:48.310]  And you're saying we all didn't realize?
[01:48.870 --> 01:51.890]  Didn't Geoff was like, also was like, oh, I didn't...
[01:51.890 --> 01:52.230]  I don't know.
[01:52.470 --> 01:55.350]  That was confusion when you brought out all the XLR cables and real mics.
[01:56.330 --> 01:57.170]  What do you mean?
[01:57.670 --> 01:59.190]  I think you were confused.
[01:59.410 --> 02:00.470]  Is that what you mean?
[02:00.890 --> 02:02.830]  There's no way Geoff wasn't also confused.
[02:03.010 --> 02:04.690]  What did you think was being made?
[02:05.090 --> 02:09.830]  I mean, I remember there being a conversation about that equipment coming to the episode.
[02:09.830 --> 02:11.510]  Between Eric and Nick.
[02:11.830 --> 02:22.730]  Do you remember the day before, Gavin, a conversation Eric had where he set it up with just so we're all on the same page and we can all create a vision for what this is going to be going into it.
[02:23.070 --> 02:24.070]  This is what's going to happen.
[02:24.290 --> 02:25.970]  Then we talked about what would happen.
[02:26.130 --> 02:27.190]  And then that happened.
[02:27.370 --> 02:29.830]  I just thought that was us set up for showing you the pizzas.
[02:29.990 --> 02:32.530]  I thought that would be like halfway through the pizza video.
[02:33.330 --> 02:37.930]  But it's also, I guess I didn't realize that was a separate piece, like the Cosmic Crisp review.
[02:39.290 --> 02:39.650]  Okay.
[02:40.250 --> 02:41.030]  Ah, I see.
[02:41.670 --> 02:43.250]  I mean, I think we went over that at the time.
[02:43.410 --> 02:43.890]  But that's fine.
[02:44.010 --> 02:45.270]  I thought we were really...
[02:45.270 --> 02:46.410]  That's fine. Doesn't matter.
[02:46.830 --> 02:48.950]  Gavin, Gavin, what can I do in the future?
[02:49.470 --> 02:51.470]  What can I do in the future to help you?
[02:51.730 --> 02:53.270]  Eric, this is not a you problem.
[02:53.550 --> 02:54.370]  This is a me problem.
[02:54.610 --> 02:57.150]  But I think it was also a Geoff problem briefly.
[02:58.110 --> 03:01.530]  Yeah, but if it was, I rolled with the punches very quickly.
[03:03.550 --> 03:06.930]  Yeah, I like the way you've posed this or you went, yeah.
[03:07.030 --> 03:09.530]  And then you brought out the equipment and we were all confused.
[03:13.050 --> 03:15.750]  I was sitting at my home going, what?
[03:16.450 --> 03:17.430]  What is happening?
[03:17.810 --> 03:18.750]  A feed?
[03:19.410 --> 03:21.150]  I have to join and record.
[03:21.450 --> 03:24.710]  I felt so much personal vindication in the recording of that.
[03:24.730 --> 03:28.330]  When we found out that Emily stopped recording at one point and missed half the pizza eating.
[03:28.710 --> 03:30.710]  You guys are meant for each other.
[03:33.770 --> 03:37.110]  It is apparently, it is easy to hit stop on a phone.
[03:38.150 --> 03:39.010]  Oh, man.
[03:39.750 --> 03:41.050]  How? I don't understand.
[03:41.370 --> 03:43.890]  You can also just look at whether it's filming or not.
[03:44.410 --> 03:46.790]  You don't understand what to do when a microphone comes out.
[03:46.870 --> 03:47.550]  I'm not trusting you.
[03:47.950 --> 03:49.570]  Well, I know what end to talk in.
[03:52.170 --> 03:52.610]  Wow.
[03:54.130 --> 03:54.870]  It's impressive.
[03:55.350 --> 03:56.510]  How many podcasts have you done?
[03:57.470 --> 03:57.910]  600?
[03:59.570 --> 04:01.330]  Confidently say, you know what end of speaking to.
[04:01.950 --> 04:03.910]  I just thought it was one video.
[04:04.550 --> 04:04.950]  Okay.
[04:05.450 --> 04:06.810]  I forgot there was a separate audio.
[04:06.970 --> 04:11.290]  For some reason, we can't ever just go and do something and just make one piece of content from it.
[04:11.490 --> 04:14.990]  Well, I remember you saying very clearly you only wanted to make one video.
[04:15.070 --> 04:15.950]  And I think that's all we're making.
[04:16.090 --> 04:16.950]  That's all we're making.
[04:17.110 --> 04:17.990]  We're only making one video.
[04:18.450 --> 04:19.590]  No, fool.
[04:19.750 --> 04:23.650]  The audio part where we sit down with all the mics has video.
[04:24.750 --> 04:27.430]  That's why I thought it was going to be in the middle of the video.
[04:29.450 --> 04:31.350]  That was so genuine.
[04:31.590 --> 04:33.730]  That was such genuine annoyance for you.
[04:34.050 --> 04:36.030]  I don't think I've ever heard you call anyone a fool.
[04:36.390 --> 04:37.970]  No, fool.
[04:38.870 --> 04:40.410]  Fool is underrated.
[04:40.830 --> 04:41.870]  Oh, man.
[04:42.290 --> 04:44.310]  I was not expecting that at all.
[04:44.670 --> 04:51.870]  It was like Gavin has had one fastball his entire career and he just threw a knuckleball at you and took us all off guard.
[04:52.490 --> 04:54.610]  No need for the icy hot this year.
[04:54.750 --> 04:56.030]  Gavin brought it verbally.
[04:58.770 --> 04:59.210]  Fool.
[05:01.730 --> 05:03.750]  That is a British ass insult.
[05:04.350 --> 05:06.670]  So what I'm saying is now it's two videos.
[05:07.090 --> 05:08.690]  No, I think it's just one.
[05:08.770 --> 05:11.630]  It is because we were filming the part where we were showing you.
[05:11.730 --> 05:14.810]  There's video in the audio part, but I don't think it's two videos.
[05:15.250 --> 05:19.470]  Yeah, just give Nick the video and he'll sync it with the audio and then that's peace.
[05:19.470 --> 05:22.110]  So when it's on YouTube and there's video of us talking.
[05:22.110 --> 05:23.250]  I see what you're saying.
[05:23.430 --> 05:24.330]  I see, I see.
[05:24.530 --> 05:25.830]  Okay, I see what you're saying.
[05:25.830 --> 05:27.730]  I think it's audio with a video component.
[05:28.230 --> 05:33.430]  What we ended up with again is an audio product that has a video in some places.
[05:33.870 --> 05:34.050]  Yeah.
[05:34.310 --> 05:36.050]  Plus the video of making the pieces.
[05:36.470 --> 05:37.490]  So there's two pieces of content.
[05:37.950 --> 05:39.230]  It is, yeah, we all agree.
[05:40.430 --> 05:42.450]  Oh, Nick said he synced everything up. It's incredible.
[05:45.770 --> 05:46.910]  I'll tell you what we have.
[05:47.010 --> 05:48.850]  We have more fucking content.
[05:49.510 --> 05:51.330]  And I, for one, I'm here for it.
[05:51.350 --> 05:54.010]  I had so much fun making those stupid pizzas with you guys.
[05:54.010 --> 05:56.230]  I am no longer scared of my pizza oven.
[05:56.370 --> 05:59.050]  It was sort of a pizza oven redemption.
[05:59.550 --> 06:07.770]  Emily and I have been talking about making our own dough and making our own pizzas and maybe not even tearing the thing down and just keeping it up and becoming backyard pizza people.
[06:07.950 --> 06:10.590]  And that wouldn't have happened if it weren't for last week.
[06:10.850 --> 06:11.610]  That was the goal, right?
[06:11.770 --> 06:18.350]  And you even talked about potentially having a future sausage talk where we just make pizzas and talk sausage at the pizza table.
[06:18.690 --> 06:19.490]  I think it's a great idea.
[06:19.530 --> 06:20.030]  I would love to.
[06:20.310 --> 06:22.010]  I mean, it's a tool at our disposal now.
[06:22.010 --> 06:25.810]  Yeah, like a sausage talk where we actually talk about sausage.
[06:26.210 --> 06:26.990]  We could do that.
[06:27.010 --> 06:27.530]  Is that the premise?
[06:27.890 --> 06:29.610]  We could get super literal.
[06:29.970 --> 06:32.910]  I can't help but notice, Andrew, that it's December now when this comes out.
[06:33.150 --> 06:33.350]  Yeah.
[06:33.690 --> 06:34.610]  Have you been here yet?
[06:35.850 --> 06:36.290]  No.
[06:37.410 --> 06:38.510]  Never said I would.
[06:38.810 --> 06:40.470]  I just said up until November.
[06:40.950 --> 06:41.730]  Been and gone, my friend.
[06:42.250 --> 06:43.070]  Yeah, it is.
[06:43.170 --> 06:44.070]  But what?
[06:44.150 --> 06:46.090]  I can't go in December or January?
[06:46.470 --> 06:47.970]  Are you blocking me from going?
[06:48.330 --> 06:49.690]  I'm not opposed to going.
[06:50.130 --> 06:50.890]  I just haven't been.
[06:50.890 --> 06:52.290]  When are we meeting up?
[06:52.630 --> 06:53.430]  When are we doing it?
[06:53.610 --> 06:55.950]  When are we going to see each other in real life, for Christ's sake?
[06:56.350 --> 06:58.970]  I don't know where all this aggression is coming from.
[06:59.410 --> 07:00.670]  It's like I called you a fool.
[07:00.730 --> 07:01.090]  I'm so excited to see you.
[07:01.970 --> 07:03.050]  Here's the deal, Andrew.
[07:03.530 --> 07:08.610]  We have done 130 episodes now of this podcast without seeing each other.
[07:08.830 --> 07:10.630]  We've all seen each other except for you.
[07:10.990 --> 07:12.750]  I'm not convinced you still are real.
[07:13.090 --> 07:15.090]  I will say I won't need an ocean to sneak.
[07:15.510 --> 07:16.870]  Well, we do see, as established.
[07:18.610 --> 07:19.590]  I'm going to be sneaky.
[07:19.590 --> 07:21.690]  Maybe I've been there and you don't even know.
[07:22.050 --> 07:23.010]  Think about that.
[07:23.070 --> 07:24.870]  Can I pose something?
[07:24.970 --> 07:27.170]  Because I was talking to someone about this the other day.
[07:27.350 --> 07:29.090]  About how we haven't seen Andrew in person.
[07:29.690 --> 07:32.290]  I think we're going to get together.
[07:32.510 --> 07:33.610]  And here's where I'm worried.
[07:33.950 --> 07:36.330]  We're going to get together to see Andrew in person.
[07:37.210 --> 07:41.330]  And then Andrew is going to hire someone to be Andrew.
[07:41.650 --> 07:44.930]  And then we're still not going to be getting together with Andrew.
[07:44.930 --> 07:51.350]  I feel like we could go to him and then a Craigslist man will show up and be like,
[07:51.350 --> 07:53.490]  Hey guys, what's up? It's me, Andrew.
[07:53.730 --> 07:55.350]  And it's like, no it's not.
[07:55.510 --> 07:57.850]  And then he's like wearing a wire.
[07:58.590 --> 07:59.890]  It's like in Roxanne.
[08:00.370 --> 08:01.530]  Yes, it's going to be something.
[08:01.630 --> 08:03.990]  I really do believe something like that.
[08:04.150 --> 08:05.390]  That's what we're in for.
[08:06.070 --> 08:07.150]  So I am worried.
[08:07.570 --> 08:09.450]  I mean, the first hurdle is you're not going to find my door.
[08:09.730 --> 08:10.690]  That's the first problem.
[08:11.710 --> 08:13.070]  Even my door is sneaky.
[08:13.290 --> 08:14.610]  Even where I live is sneaky.
[08:14.610 --> 08:15.710]  That's how sneaky I am.
[08:16.290 --> 08:18.810]  We don't have to find your door if you bring it with you to America.
[08:19.170 --> 08:20.290]  It seems like a lot of work.
[08:20.650 --> 08:22.310]  I typically only travel with a carry-on.
[08:22.490 --> 08:24.090]  Would I check that?
[08:24.510 --> 08:25.890]  Could I travel with my door?
[08:26.410 --> 08:27.570]  How much would that cost?
[08:27.990 --> 08:30.170]  I mean, people travel with surfboards and shit, right?
[08:30.370 --> 08:31.350]  Yeah, that's true.
[08:31.750 --> 08:33.370]  Yeah, it's probably less inconvenient.
[08:33.730 --> 08:35.330]  Just strap a handle on it.
[08:37.610 --> 08:41.250]  I'm worried that when we all meet up, we're not even going to be able to look each other in the eye.
[08:42.210 --> 08:43.630]  Yeah, I don't know what that means.
[08:43.630 --> 08:44.230]  What do you mean?
[08:44.630 --> 08:45.530]  What are you talking about?
[08:45.870 --> 08:46.350]  It's going to be weird.
[08:46.850 --> 08:47.850]  Why is it going to be weird?
[08:48.370 --> 08:52.170]  Look, I didn't know you had a giant bushy beard until you told me one day.
[08:52.430 --> 08:53.370]  You didn't know I had a cat.
[08:53.490 --> 08:54.590]  You don't know anything about me.
[08:54.870 --> 08:55.550]  That's not my fault.
[08:55.870 --> 08:57.850]  I don't think that changes if we see you in person.
[08:59.730 --> 09:01.710]  Yeah, but that's a fair point, Andrew.
[09:02.130 --> 09:05.490]  But I think you're underestimating Gavin's natural awkwardness.
[09:05.650 --> 09:07.930]  I have trouble looking him in the eyes in person.
[09:08.150 --> 09:11.130]  It's weird for me to see Gavin, and we see each other all the time.
[09:12.230 --> 09:12.670]  Wow.
[09:17.700 --> 09:19.120]  I can look Eric in the eye.
[09:19.780 --> 09:22.040]  You know what? Did we...
[09:22.040 --> 09:22.200]  Awesome.
[09:26.480 --> 09:28.480]  Man, today has been a fun energy.
[09:28.900 --> 09:30.900]  This has been a real weird one.
[09:31.100 --> 09:32.060]  It has been a weird day.
[09:32.180 --> 09:33.460]  These two episodes are really good.
[09:33.460 --> 09:36.660]  It was just nothing. It was quiet.
[09:36.940 --> 09:38.240]  I can look Eric in the eye.
[09:39.920 --> 09:41.860]  I was getting ready to ask a question.
[09:41.860 --> 09:47.120]  Did Gavin ever give approval on the photo that he took when we did the Icy Hot thing?
[09:47.240 --> 09:48.280]  Is that going to be shared?
[09:48.360 --> 09:48.500]  Oh, I don't know.
[09:49.060 --> 09:51.360]  Do we have a definitive statement on that?
[09:51.700 --> 09:55.000]  Oh, you wanted to make a version where you couldn't see as much lap and thighs?
[09:55.720 --> 09:57.260]  I didn't know if you were okay with it.
[09:57.320 --> 09:59.740]  I had a few versions of it.
[09:59.840 --> 10:01.020]  Okay, I'd love to see them.
[10:01.120 --> 10:03.700]  I know this is an audio format, so we won't be too quick.
[10:03.760 --> 10:04.700]  We'll try to describe what we did.
[10:04.760 --> 10:07.120]  This was the original photo, just as a refresher.
[10:07.220 --> 10:08.440]  People may have already seen it.
[10:08.840 --> 10:10.760]  Which I think is fine, by the way.
[10:10.760 --> 10:11.980]  I do think it's fine, too.
[10:12.040 --> 10:13.600]  It's just a little alarming.
[10:14.580 --> 10:18.900]  So we have a few options that if you weren't okay with it, Gavin, that we could go with.
[10:19.800 --> 10:23.160]  The first one I did, I thought, let's try to remove as much as we can.
[10:23.920 --> 10:26.420]  So I did just the face.
[10:27.120 --> 10:28.040]  Only the face.
[10:29.080 --> 10:30.140]  How do you feel about that one?
[10:31.480 --> 10:32.500]  Somehow worse, I think.
[10:32.540 --> 10:33.400]  You think it's somehow worse?
[10:33.500 --> 10:34.000]  I agree.
[10:34.260 --> 10:37.560]  That's great because people can draw in what they think is happening in the photo.
[10:37.700 --> 10:38.700]  I think that's a great idea.
[10:38.820 --> 10:39.260]  They could.
[10:39.260 --> 10:39.700]  Yeah.
[10:39.760 --> 10:40.980]  Great contest for the audience.
[10:41.500 --> 10:42.900]  Which is also what I put together.
[10:43.060 --> 10:44.160]  It gave me vibes of that.
[10:47.460 --> 10:48.860]  The seed and the shining.
[10:49.580 --> 10:53.160]  When he chops a hole through the door and shoves his face in.
[10:53.420 --> 10:54.200]  That's very similar.
[10:54.460 --> 10:56.200]  Thanks for leaving my headphones on in that one.
[10:56.340 --> 10:56.980]  Yeah, no problem.
[10:57.220 --> 10:59.040]  Well, listen, I'm just throwing things together.
[10:59.980 --> 11:02.140]  This isn't a professional operation, Gavin.
[11:02.480 --> 11:04.900]  We have a few other options that we could go with.
[11:05.000 --> 11:05.500]  This one.
[11:06.080 --> 11:06.600]  This one.
[11:07.060 --> 11:07.980]  Just the knees.
[11:07.980 --> 11:09.700]  Everything else is gone.
[11:11.460 --> 11:12.340]  Only legs.
[11:12.540 --> 11:13.580]  I think that's even better.
[11:14.380 --> 11:16.360]  I feel like that one is uncomfortable.
[11:16.360 --> 11:19.300]  Unless you've seen the whole picture, you can barely tell what's happening there.
[11:19.460 --> 11:19.700]  Yeah.
[11:23.520 --> 11:24.840]  Maybe it's like a DIY.
[11:25.140 --> 11:27.980]  You have to stitch it together yourself if you really want to see what it looks like.
[11:30.400 --> 11:33.140]  And the last one that I'm going to show.
[11:33.480 --> 11:36.660]  I think this is the most disturbing of all of them, personally.
[11:36.660 --> 11:40.480]  I think it leaves the most, I don't know, vulgarity.
[11:41.360 --> 11:42.460]  It's just uncomfortable.
[11:43.200 --> 11:44.380]  It seems like it would be...
[11:44.380 --> 11:46.400]  It's the same one.
[11:46.920 --> 11:49.080]  I'm getting them all mixed up in my log.
[11:49.400 --> 11:49.820]  Here we go.
[11:50.320 --> 11:51.100]  This is the right one.
[11:51.400 --> 11:54.020]  So this is everything from the arms down.
[11:54.360 --> 11:55.880]  That just seems bad.
[11:57.340 --> 11:58.640]  See partial arms?
[11:58.880 --> 12:00.160]  It just feels bad.
[12:01.140 --> 12:04.400]  It feels a lot worse than the actual photo is.
[12:04.400 --> 12:06.880]  I think that one actually makes it a worse photo.
[12:07.160 --> 12:10.700]  Maybe we should use Photoshop to draw around the censored area.
[12:10.900 --> 12:12.700]  And do like a content aware fill.
[12:13.000 --> 12:14.040]  And see what it comes up with.
[12:15.600 --> 12:16.860]  Do you have Photoshop?
[12:17.440 --> 12:18.080]  I don't.
[12:18.180 --> 12:19.200]  I can tell.
[12:22.160 --> 12:22.920]  I used to.
[12:23.380 --> 12:24.560]  I don't have it on this computer.
[12:25.760 --> 12:26.820]  I'm afraid I don't either.
[12:27.360 --> 12:28.600]  So I don't know what we'll go with.
[12:28.640 --> 12:29.600]  Maybe those will all be public.
[12:29.740 --> 12:32.380]  But I wanted to run some options just in case you were...
[12:32.380 --> 12:35.580]  I think I'm fine with any version you want.
[12:36.480 --> 12:39.060]  But I do like the idea of having to put it all together yourself.
[12:39.280 --> 12:41.540]  Maybe we'll release all those...
[12:41.540 --> 12:42.420]  Fuck, I don't know.
[12:42.980 --> 12:45.400]  Because the Brazzers one is going to come out first, right?
[12:45.820 --> 12:46.140]  Yeah.
[12:46.440 --> 12:46.880]  That's fine.
[12:47.480 --> 12:48.140]  Oh man.
[12:48.680 --> 12:50.460]  Andrew, those are so fucking funny.
[12:53.220 --> 12:54.560]  I was having fun last night.
[12:54.640 --> 12:55.740]  Just trying to come up with different options.
[12:56.080 --> 12:56.880]  I wanted to see knees.
[12:57.020 --> 12:57.620]  I wanted to see face.
[12:57.700 --> 12:58.860]  I think we kind of covered things.
[12:58.960 --> 13:02.040]  And I'm sure people will be creative in their own ways.
[13:03.400 --> 13:07.220]  Did you see some of the photoshops people did, Geoff, of you with the door?
[13:07.580 --> 13:10.140]  The awkward door photo you took when you were at the restaurant?
[13:11.100 --> 13:11.900]  Uh, no.
[13:12.520 --> 13:14.260]  No, I never really paid attention to those.
[13:14.460 --> 13:15.740]  I'll see if I can find any of them.
[13:15.880 --> 13:18.200]  I'm sure I probably look super cool in them.
[13:18.260 --> 13:18.600]  You do.
[13:19.060 --> 13:19.620]  It's great.
[13:20.980 --> 13:22.540]  But yeah, that was the photo.
[13:23.440 --> 13:25.560]  Photos I put together for the show.
[13:26.280 --> 13:27.740]  I had one other thing.
[13:28.880 --> 13:30.260]  I did a strange...
[13:30.260 --> 13:31.060]  What should I talk about?
[13:31.060 --> 13:31.940]  I got two things.
[13:32.480 --> 13:32.740]  Okay.
[13:34.460 --> 13:35.480]  We'll go with the dollar store.
[13:35.740 --> 13:37.820]  So we watched MVP 2 recently.
[13:38.440 --> 13:41.080]  And I was looking at MVP 2 because I was just curious.
[13:41.340 --> 13:42.760]  I thought I should own a copy of it.
[13:43.040 --> 13:43.860]  So I have it in my collection.
[13:44.280 --> 13:48.380]  Real fast, has that come out yet as of the release of this episode, Eric?
[13:48.820 --> 13:49.160]  Fantastic.
[13:49.160 --> 13:51.520]  This will come out the 30th.
[13:51.880 --> 13:58.360]  And I think the Monkey movie, if Nick gets the editing good to go, that should have been out for a week at this point.
[13:58.460 --> 13:58.900]  Nick, that's right.
[13:59.600 --> 14:00.820]  I think we're good.
[14:00.820 --> 14:01.900]  I think we're all lined up.
[14:01.980 --> 14:02.540]  Monkey movie, yeah.
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.720]  So as of this, we put out a bunch of Ansoni content recently.
[14:08.080 --> 14:13.000]  The Survive Black Island Meltdown recap conversation about all the stuff that wasn't in the show apparently.
[14:13.880 --> 14:14.900]  The Monkey movie.
[14:15.520 --> 14:16.680]  We've recorded the pizza.
[14:16.800 --> 14:18.060]  Probably haven't released that yet.
[14:18.760 --> 14:22.800]  But anyway, just to catch the audience up, make sure everybody's aware of what we've made and where it is.
[14:23.320 --> 14:23.820]  Continue, Andrew.
[14:24.320 --> 14:26.180]  So I was looking online for copies of it.
[14:26.220 --> 14:28.160]  And I found a VHS one that was sealed.
[14:28.160 --> 14:34.960]  It had this big sticker on the front that said, also, it includes special behind the scenes with Bob Burnquist.
[14:35.100 --> 14:37.120]  Like a skate segment with him.
[14:37.480 --> 14:38.740]  And I was like, I want to see that.
[14:38.860 --> 14:40.140]  That sounds fantastic.
[14:40.620 --> 14:41.560]  So I looked at the DVD.
[14:41.940 --> 14:43.460]  Had even more special features.
[14:43.600 --> 14:46.140]  It has a laugh, not a laugh track, a blooper reel.
[14:46.860 --> 14:48.240]  It has the Burnquist thing.
[14:48.520 --> 14:49.980]  So I've been trying to find a copy of it.
[14:50.220 --> 14:55.060]  But I don't think I'm going to be able to go into just like a Best Buy and find MVP 2 on DVD.
[14:55.180 --> 14:57.720]  I felt like my best chance to find it would be at like a thrift store.
[14:57.720 --> 14:58.580]  Type of thing.
[14:58.760 --> 14:59.920]  So I was looking.
[15:00.320 --> 15:01.920]  I was going all over the thrift store.
[15:02.040 --> 15:04.960]  They had so many fucking DVDs it took me forever to get through.
[15:05.760 --> 15:06.840]  And I didn't find it.
[15:06.980 --> 15:08.300]  And that was incredibly disappointing.
[15:08.740 --> 15:11.260]  But I think I found something even more obscure.
[15:11.960 --> 15:12.960]  Which I bought.
[15:13.220 --> 15:14.920]  And I'm posting a photo of it right now.
[15:15.260 --> 15:18.720]  I found a sealed copy of the first season of The Strangerhood.
[15:19.820 --> 15:21.740]  In the thrift store I went into.
[15:23.300 --> 15:25.840]  I can't believe they didn't have MVP 2.
[15:25.840 --> 15:28.040]  But they did have a sealed copy of The Strangerhood.
[15:28.220 --> 15:28.840]  Five dollars.
[15:29.000 --> 15:29.540]  Great buy.
[15:30.220 --> 15:30.760]  I was very happy.
[15:31.320 --> 15:31.660]  Oh yeah.
[15:31.840 --> 15:33.000]  I took a photo of it.
[15:33.120 --> 15:33.940]  I unsealed it.
[15:34.160 --> 15:35.760]  To get a sweet coupon.
[15:36.920 --> 15:40.800]  So I can mail in this thing to buy some sweet merch.
[15:41.260 --> 15:42.200]  Gotta mail it to Buddha.
[15:43.160 --> 15:43.560]  Texas.
[15:44.440 --> 15:44.600]  Wherever.
[15:45.140 --> 15:45.840]  Let me grab...
[15:45.840 --> 15:49.960]  You know, if you paid five dollars for that DVD you probably got ripped off.
[15:50.020 --> 15:54.400]  I think we were selling it for like two bucks on the site before we discontinued it.
[15:54.480 --> 15:55.020]  Five bucks.
[15:55.020 --> 15:56.960]  Maybe we're still selling it for all I know.
[15:57.160 --> 15:57.940]  I don't think so.
[15:57.940 --> 15:58.660]  That hasn't gone well at all.
[15:59.380 --> 16:00.440]  Is that what you...
[16:00.440 --> 16:01.020]  Is that...
[16:02.020 --> 16:02.820]  Oh lord.
[16:03.460 --> 16:04.020]  That looks so bad.
[16:04.020 --> 16:05.320]  That's what Photoshop's thought should be.
[16:05.480 --> 16:06.360]  Oh no!
[16:06.860 --> 16:08.700]  Photoshop made it way too sexy.
[16:09.240 --> 16:09.420]  Ugh.
[16:10.800 --> 16:11.200]  That's...
[16:11.200 --> 16:12.580]  Yeah, that's not better.
[16:13.180 --> 16:14.600]  Yeah, well, we won't release that one.
[16:14.860 --> 16:15.960]  Yeah, that's...
[16:17.400 --> 16:22.420]  If you want to know what Photoshop thinks Gavin's middle looks like, download Photoshop and do it yourself.
[16:22.840 --> 16:23.420]  It's not great.
[16:23.880 --> 16:24.700]  We're not going to do that for you.
[16:24.700 --> 16:24.860]  Yeah.
[16:25.360 --> 16:26.520]  So I didn't find MVP2.
[16:26.600 --> 16:30.020]  The other thing, I asked Geoff and Gavin this.
[16:30.120 --> 16:32.820]  I'm curious if your answer to this has changed, Geoff.
[16:32.860 --> 16:34.040]  I'd love to hear your response, Eric.
[16:34.660 --> 16:36.580]  The idea was, if they were...
[16:36.580 --> 16:41.100]  If it was decided that you could no longer have tap water running through your house,
[16:41.140 --> 16:45.000]  but you had to replace it with something else, what would you switch it from?
[16:45.620 --> 16:49.020]  Gavin said apple-tizer, which is a drink I'd never heard of.
[16:49.340 --> 16:51.480]  Geoff, at the time, you said diet Pepsi.
[16:52.360 --> 16:55.600]  But then brought up a great point of trying to shower with diet Pepsi would be terrible.
[16:55.880 --> 16:56.820]  I didn't even think of it in that way.
[16:57.160 --> 17:00.700]  I was just thinking of something, because to me, water is the best beverage.
[17:00.840 --> 17:02.480]  It's what I drink the most of.
[17:02.520 --> 17:03.080]  It's so convenient.
[17:03.560 --> 17:04.060]  It's great.
[17:04.580 --> 17:07.000]  So I was curious, if you had to flip, what would it be?
[17:07.400 --> 17:08.760]  Do you have an answer, Eric, for this?
[17:09.740 --> 17:10.380]  Man, I...
[17:10.380 --> 17:12.780]  Boy, that's tough, because I don't really drink...
[17:12.780 --> 17:16.140]  I don't really drink soda, and soda feels like the natural goat.
[17:16.240 --> 17:18.700]  People are going to be like, root beer, which is crazy, whatever.
[17:19.240 --> 17:20.760]  But I don't really drink soda at all.
[17:21.520 --> 17:22.700]  That sounds dangerous.
[17:23.180 --> 17:27.440]  But I want to say, like, beer or something, but then you can't shower.
[17:28.580 --> 17:30.560]  That really threw me for a loop, the shower thing.
[17:30.640 --> 17:32.140]  The shower becomes a problem.
[17:32.640 --> 17:32.780]  Yeah.
[17:33.260 --> 17:34.820]  And, like, washing your hands?
[17:35.020 --> 17:41.440]  Like, I could take a shit into beer, but then washing your hands when you're done, you know what I mean?
[17:41.600 --> 17:42.560]  Yeah, no, it'd be terrible.
[17:43.460 --> 17:44.740]  Take a shit into beer?
[17:45.180 --> 17:45.980]  Yeah, you could.
[17:46.240 --> 17:47.060]  I mean, that would be fine.
[17:47.100 --> 17:47.440]  Oh, yeah, a little water.
[17:48.060 --> 17:49.140]  Oh, I see what you're saying.
[17:49.220 --> 17:49.680]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17:49.680 --> 17:50.060]  Yeah.
[17:52.020 --> 17:54.500]  You think that that was just a fun fact on the side?
[17:54.780 --> 17:55.920]  Why were you thrown off by that?
[17:55.980 --> 17:57.780]  For some reason, I was just picturing a pint glass.
[17:57.920 --> 17:58.540]  I was like, that's disgusting.
[17:58.540 --> 17:59.700]  Oh, no, that's terrible.
[17:59.940 --> 18:00.300]  What the fuck?
[18:00.420 --> 18:01.180]  I mean, I could.
[18:01.520 --> 18:02.520]  I could do that.
[18:02.640 --> 18:04.140]  Okay, let's just go purely in taste.
[18:04.260 --> 18:05.680]  Let's remove all other functionality.
[18:06.940 --> 18:07.680]  I would see...
[18:08.560 --> 18:10.740]  I think I would have to go with beer.
[18:11.160 --> 18:14.080]  And then I would just have to keep waters in the fridge.
[18:14.980 --> 18:15.180]  Okay.
[18:15.480 --> 18:16.420]  What do you...
[18:16.420 --> 18:17.000]  For showering?
[18:17.400 --> 18:18.960]  No, we just said for taste only.
[18:18.960 --> 18:19.680]  You're an idiot.
[18:20.060 --> 18:21.800]  You're a fucking fool, Gavin.
[18:22.240 --> 18:23.180]  No, but I want to...
[18:23.180 --> 18:26.400]  But along with what Gavin said, let's go the other route.
[18:26.580 --> 18:28.500]  Like, you do have to shower with it.
[18:28.560 --> 18:33.360]  So what is the one liquid you would want to shower with the most other than water?
[18:33.560 --> 18:34.680]  Like, water's not available.
[18:34.780 --> 18:35.420]  You got to shower.
[18:35.500 --> 18:37.440]  What's the least offensive liquid to shower with?
[18:38.340 --> 18:39.080]  Pineapple juice.
[18:39.620 --> 18:40.200]  Tea tree oil.
[18:40.880 --> 18:41.220]  What?
[18:41.420 --> 18:42.120]  Well, that's an oil.
[18:42.200 --> 18:42.780]  Tea tree oil?
[18:43.500 --> 18:44.640]  You're going to shower with oil?
[18:44.800 --> 18:45.920]  You're a freak.
[18:46.160 --> 18:46.740]  Hey, Gavin.
[18:47.100 --> 18:47.500]  Gavin.
[18:47.500 --> 18:49.740]  I think of something that says shampoo sometimes.
[18:50.320 --> 18:50.940]  You fool!
[18:53.520 --> 18:55.320]  I think it would be iced tea.
[18:55.760 --> 18:56.720]  Unsweetened iced tea.
[18:56.820 --> 18:58.640]  That feels the most like water to me.
[18:58.640 --> 18:59.520]  That's a good one.
[18:59.620 --> 19:01.280]  I feel like I could get clean in iced tea.
[19:01.900 --> 19:03.340]  Old tea smells really gammy.
[19:03.980 --> 19:04.520]  Could you do...
[19:04.520 --> 19:05.520]  I mean, none of these are ideal.
[19:06.100 --> 19:09.720]  Could you do, like, a coconut water?
[19:09.860 --> 19:10.520]  Is that something?
[19:10.680 --> 19:11.240]  Rubbing alcohol.
[19:11.520 --> 19:13.600]  Oh my god.
[19:13.800 --> 19:14.960]  Nick, you're a fucking maniac.
[19:15.200 --> 19:16.760]  Burn your fucking eyeballs out, dude.
[19:16.760 --> 19:17.740]  Yeah, what the fuck?
[19:17.860 --> 19:18.980]  It's not sticky.
[19:19.260 --> 19:22.540]  His whole thing is that it's not sticky and it's clean.
[19:22.700 --> 19:23.380]  What a maniac.
[19:23.800 --> 19:25.200]  So many drinks have sugar.
[19:25.280 --> 19:26.820]  You couldn't use any of those for showering.
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.740]  If that's the price to be good at cornhole, I don't want to pay.
[19:29.980 --> 19:31.400]  That's too much for me.
[19:33.400 --> 19:34.620]  Could you do...
[19:34.620 --> 19:36.460]  So, I'm thinking, like, coconut water.
[19:36.820 --> 19:37.520]  That's something.
[19:37.860 --> 19:38.940]  That's water, though.
[19:39.280 --> 19:40.580]  Yeah, it's like stick...
[19:40.580 --> 19:42.040]  No, but it's just from a coconut.
[19:42.120 --> 19:43.020]  It's just coconut juice.
[19:43.500 --> 19:44.600]  It's just like the inside of a coconut.
[19:45.520 --> 19:47.760]  Man, could you...
[19:47.760 --> 19:48.280]  Oh, boy.
[19:48.400 --> 19:49.160]  I don't know.
[19:49.920 --> 19:50.220]  It's tough.
[19:50.300 --> 19:51.260]  I don't think there's a great answer.
[19:51.480 --> 19:52.580]  It can't have sugar.
[19:52.720 --> 19:53.040]  Gav's right.
[19:53.120 --> 19:54.440]  It's like you can't have anything sugary.
[19:54.580 --> 19:55.640]  Pineapple juice would be terrible.
[19:55.780 --> 19:57.000]  Pineapple juice is so sticky.
[19:57.020 --> 19:57.080]  Oh, yeah.
[19:57.080 --> 19:57.480]  Oh, the smell.
[19:57.740 --> 19:58.440]  The smell, though.
[19:58.680 --> 19:59.500]  The smell would be amazing.
[20:01.600 --> 20:03.460]  Yeah, it'd have to be something unsweetened.
[20:03.560 --> 20:04.040]  It'd have to be...
[20:04.040 --> 20:04.200]  Yeah.
[20:04.840 --> 20:05.940]  Iced coffee, maybe?
[20:06.400 --> 20:07.000]  How much?
[20:08.280 --> 20:08.760]  That'd be great.
[20:09.180 --> 20:10.980]  How much would you need...
[20:11.380 --> 20:13.660]  If you had to go seven days, where...
[20:13.660 --> 20:17.060]  I'm thinking of, like, replace it with...
[20:17.060 --> 20:18.880]  What's something that's close to water without being water?
[20:19.520 --> 20:20.540]  I'm going the other way now.
[20:21.000 --> 20:25.240]  Seven days where they just replace all the water coming out of your faucets with whole milk.
[20:25.800 --> 20:28.120]  How much would you have to get paid for that?
[20:28.420 --> 20:30.000]  I mean, Geoff would just never turn on a tap.
[20:30.320 --> 20:30.540]  Ever.
[20:30.660 --> 20:32.020]  You gotta take a shower.
[20:32.280 --> 20:34.100]  You can't go somewhere else to shower.
[20:34.320 --> 20:36.240]  You've gotta do your daily stuff.
[20:36.520 --> 20:38.640]  You're telling me I gotta brush my teeth with milk?
[20:38.980 --> 20:39.900]  Whole milk, yeah.
[20:39.920 --> 20:41.180]  It would ruin your life.
[20:41.720 --> 20:42.600]  Your life would be over.
[20:43.420 --> 20:44.420]  Ten million dollars.
[20:45.200 --> 20:45.580]  Really?
[20:45.940 --> 20:47.080]  I would do it for ten million dollars.
[20:47.180 --> 20:49.320]  You wouldn't do it for nine million dollars?
[20:49.780 --> 20:50.320]  No, I would.
[20:50.520 --> 20:53.340]  I would discuss it with Emily.
[20:54.080 --> 20:56.380]  You'd have nine million dollars right in front of you and you'd say no.
[20:56.640 --> 20:59.460]  Do you know how fucking white milk is?
[20:59.700 --> 21:02.060]  Do you know how fucking gross milk is?
[21:02.420 --> 21:02.660]  Uh-huh.
[21:03.760 --> 21:05.180]  Nine million, you'd say no.
[21:05.840 --> 21:07.000]  So then what am I doing after that?
[21:07.460 --> 21:08.220]  Toweling off?
[21:08.660 --> 21:11.260]  Am I washing with a flannel after the milk?
[21:11.260 --> 21:12.760]  I can still do that, right?
[21:13.220 --> 21:17.560]  Yeah, yeah, I mean you can still, you know, you can do everything else is the same.
[21:18.080 --> 21:21.560]  All your other, you know, showering routines and getting clean is the same.
[21:21.660 --> 21:25.000]  But everything is just no more water, just for seven days it's whole milk.
[21:25.320 --> 21:26.580]  And I can't use an alternative.
[21:27.060 --> 21:27.920]  No, no, no, no.
[21:28.980 --> 21:33.280]  It's like if everything you were gonna do with water is just replaced with milk.
[21:33.620 --> 21:33.940]  Just for a week then.
[21:33.940 --> 21:34.780]  Everything's one to one the same.
[21:35.260 --> 21:36.460]  Just for a week, just seven days.
[21:36.860 --> 21:39.160]  I would do that for like 200 grand.
[21:39.720 --> 21:40.520]  200 grand.
[21:41.100 --> 21:41.620]  For a week?
[21:42.080 --> 21:42.480]  Easy.
[21:43.940 --> 21:45.920]  Geoff said 10 million dollars.
[21:46.060 --> 21:49.800]  I, well, I was agreeing with him and then I realized it wasn't for life, it was just for a week.
[21:50.600 --> 21:53.800]  Gavin also likes milk, I actively dislike milk.
[21:53.820 --> 21:59.140]  Are you saying that you really wouldn't do nine million for one week of milk?
[21:59.740 --> 22:00.840]  Nine million dollars.
[22:01.060 --> 22:02.280]  Alright, alright, alright, I'll tell you what.
[22:02.480 --> 22:04.660]  I'll tell you what, I'm gonna give you guys the friend discount.
[22:04.800 --> 22:07.000]  I'll do it for nine million dollars.
[22:07.000 --> 22:14.480]  Wow, so you're telling me that if I showed up with eight million dollars right now, you would not do it for eight million dollars.
[22:14.520 --> 22:15.640]  Do you have eight million dollars?
[22:15.760 --> 22:22.420]  No, no, I'm asking you that like right now in front of you, you would say no to eight million dollars for seven measly days of four million.
[22:22.420 --> 22:24.300]  Alright, well, I would do it for eight grand.
[22:24.920 --> 22:25.320]  Here we go.
[22:25.620 --> 22:26.020]  Absolutely.
[22:26.620 --> 22:28.880]  Is it eight million dollars in cash?
[22:29.100 --> 22:30.340]  Yes, in cash, right to you.
[22:30.600 --> 22:31.540]  Tax free.
[22:32.060 --> 22:33.260]  Government doesn't know about it.
[22:33.400 --> 22:34.940]  Okay, I'll do it for eight million.
[22:34.940 --> 22:38.200]  Okay, so seven million dollars, there's no way you would do it.
[22:38.300 --> 22:39.640]  Now, eight million dollars is as low as I can go.
[22:39.840 --> 22:43.060]  I've given you guys a 20% discount, that's as far down as I can go.
[22:43.120 --> 22:43.920]  It's a week!
[22:44.620 --> 22:47.520]  Seven million dollars, that's a million dollars a day, Jack.
[22:47.520 --> 22:49.640]  Yeah, a little bit more than a million dollars a day, yeah.
[22:49.720 --> 22:52.440]  I'm lactose intolerant, I would do it for a grand.
[22:54.020 --> 22:55.180]  Let's see how low this would go.
[22:55.400 --> 22:57.420]  One week, only milk comes through the taps.
[22:59.040 --> 22:59.780]  Yeah, two grand?
[23:00.600 --> 23:00.860]  Yeah.
[23:01.920 --> 23:03.880]  Can I go out of town on vacation that week?
[23:03.880 --> 23:08.880]  No, no, no, no, you're at home, it's a normal week, everything's the same, it's regular.
[23:09.160 --> 23:14.600]  I mean, I had a week a couple of years ago, my water was off for like a week, and I had no power for four days.
[23:14.880 --> 23:17.260]  It's just gonna be like that. It's gonna be shitty for a week.
[23:17.740 --> 23:18.840]  No, it's gonna be milky for a week.
[23:19.260 --> 23:20.720]  Yeah, it's gonna be milky for a week.
[23:21.820 --> 23:26.180]  So you like, Gavin, you love to make pasta, as you say, right?
[23:26.620 --> 23:28.700]  You fucking make pasta all the time.
[23:29.020 --> 23:31.620]  So you would have to boil your noodles in milk.
[23:31.620 --> 23:34.060]  I probably wouldn't make that that week.
[23:35.740 --> 23:37.920]  I'd probably have a lot of milk-based food.
[23:38.500 --> 23:39.040]  Smoothies?
[23:39.400 --> 23:41.900]  You would just eat cereal for seven days.
[23:44.300 --> 23:46.620]  Hot chocolate? I'd live off of hot chocolate.
[23:47.360 --> 23:47.900]  Cappuccinos?
[23:48.460 --> 23:54.700]  Hot chocolate's good once. You wouldn't want two hot chocolates in the same day.
[23:54.700 --> 24:00.620]  To rephrase this question, Geoff would be unwilling to only drink hot chocolate for a week for eight million dollars.
[24:00.620 --> 24:03.780]  That would be the minimum amount. That's the most absurd thing ever.
[24:03.960 --> 24:07.120]  I somehow ignored the seven days part the first time we were thinking about this.
[24:07.320 --> 24:08.620]  I heard it, but it just didn't go in.
[24:09.440 --> 24:10.180]  This sounds great.
[24:10.640 --> 24:12.120]  I'll do it for eight million dollars.
[24:12.380 --> 24:13.880]  Not for seven million dollars?
[24:14.120 --> 24:15.740]  If you guys wanna put that together...
[24:15.740 --> 24:19.860]  Geoff, how would you not do that for a grand a day? How would you not do that for seven thousand dollars?
[24:20.140 --> 24:24.060]  Here's how it works, Gav, with you guys. I gotta take a stand at some point.
[24:24.140 --> 24:27.880]  Because if I do it for seven, I'll do it for six. And if I do it for six, I'll do it for five.
[24:27.880 --> 24:29.600]  And the next thing you know...
[24:29.600 --> 24:32.060]  The next thing you know...
[24:32.060 --> 24:35.580]  A week from now, I'm paying you guys to have my fucking...
[24:35.580 --> 24:37.340]  All of my...
[24:38.120 --> 24:38.520]  Water...
[24:39.400 --> 24:40.380]  Sorry, I'm choking to death.
[24:40.680 --> 24:43.780]  I'm paying to have all my water replaced with milk for a week, and somehow I'm paying for it.
[24:43.980 --> 24:45.720]  No. Eight million dollars firm.
[24:47.060 --> 24:48.700]  I'm gonna have a glass of Diet Dr. Pepper.
[24:49.000 --> 24:52.300]  Which I would replace all of my tap water with for...
[24:52.300 --> 24:52.500]  Really?
[24:53.100 --> 24:53.880]  Eighteen bucks.
[24:53.880 --> 24:55.300]  You're bumping Pepsi.
[24:57.780 --> 24:59.820]  Interesting. Well, I have...
[24:59.820 --> 25:02.240]  Because of this conversation, I had never heard of Appletizer.
[25:02.640 --> 25:04.000]  I ordered Appletizer.
[25:04.540 --> 25:07.300]  One of the weirdest online store experiences I've ever had.
[25:07.380 --> 25:09.740]  Have you ever had an online store try to haggle with you?
[25:10.580 --> 25:11.140]  No.
[25:12.000 --> 25:12.640]  On eBay.
[25:13.460 --> 25:15.480]  Yeah, but that's like a different thing.
[25:15.580 --> 25:18.920]  This was like just a website that sold imported goods.
[25:18.920 --> 25:20.460]  And so I had to find...
[25:20.460 --> 25:23.840]  They don't make this anywhere outside of Europe, I'm assuming.
[25:23.960 --> 25:24.760]  In like South Africa.
[25:24.840 --> 25:27.540]  I think I bought it from a South African imported store.
[25:28.180 --> 25:28.840]  Do they have Appletizer?
[25:29.200 --> 25:29.820]  They do.
[25:30.700 --> 25:31.800]  I got it in my cart.
[25:32.220 --> 25:33.160]  I put two in.
[25:33.700 --> 25:34.520]  And then I went to checkout.
[25:34.620 --> 25:35.540]  Put in all my information.
[25:36.200 --> 25:37.040]  Went to cash out.
[25:37.200 --> 25:37.960]  It was the last button.
[25:38.020 --> 25:38.680]  Address, all that.
[25:38.740 --> 25:39.180]  Hit clear.
[25:39.540 --> 25:41.580]  Then it said, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[25:41.760 --> 25:44.920]  How would you like one more can?
[25:45.480 --> 25:46.320]  Eight percent off.
[25:46.860 --> 25:49.220]  Offer you eight percent off on this can right now.
[25:49.300 --> 25:51.380]  You add one more to your cart before you finalize it.
[25:51.440 --> 25:52.760]  I was like, this is so weird.
[25:53.060 --> 25:53.700]  I remember I had this app.
[25:53.900 --> 25:54.920]  It had a timer on it.
[25:54.980 --> 25:58.520]  I was on like a shot clock to figure out if I wanted one more can or not.
[25:59.100 --> 26:00.360]  And I was like, I don't know.
[26:00.400 --> 26:01.780]  Maybe I love apple drinks.
[26:01.900 --> 26:02.900]  Maybe I do want three.
[26:03.020 --> 26:03.680]  Eight percent off.
[26:04.380 --> 26:05.500]  I'm going to say no.
[26:05.560 --> 26:06.280]  I'm going to pass on this.
[26:06.320 --> 26:07.420]  So I said, no thank you.
[26:07.840 --> 26:09.760]  And then another screen popped up.
[26:09.820 --> 26:12.060]  And it said, okay, we understand.
[26:12.640 --> 26:15.000]  How about 15 percent off?
[26:15.000 --> 26:16.640]  Can we entice you to buy it?
[26:16.740 --> 26:18.660]  We went through two screens.
[26:19.100 --> 26:20.420]  I had a 15 percent discount.
[26:20.800 --> 26:22.920]  I wanted to take the can at that point.
[26:23.180 --> 26:25.200]  But I needed to see how far we could go.
[26:25.520 --> 26:28.760]  Like, could I get the 30 percent by just constantly saying no?
[26:29.400 --> 26:30.660]  And so I did it again.
[26:31.100 --> 26:31.780]  And it just ended.
[26:31.920 --> 26:33.660]  It was like, okay, well your transaction is done.
[26:33.780 --> 26:34.500]  I was very sad.
[26:34.680 --> 26:38.100]  But they did offer me a 20 percent off coupon on my next order.
[26:38.260 --> 26:42.180]  It was the most bizarre online shopping experience I think I've ever had.
[26:42.180 --> 26:44.340]  I love it when people put timers on that shit.
[26:44.460 --> 26:46.380]  Even though it's infinite for everyone.
[26:46.640 --> 26:47.140]  For all time.
[26:47.540 --> 26:52.700]  Do you think you could then go use that 20 percent discount on more appletini and another purchase?
[26:52.880 --> 26:55.820]  And then they'll also offer you the 8 and 15 percent discount?
[26:56.180 --> 26:58.700]  So you get a 15 percent discount on top of a 20 percent discount.
[26:58.980 --> 26:59.920]  That's a great question.
[26:59.920 --> 27:03.280]  And get rewarded with a new 20 percent discount for your efforts.
[27:03.740 --> 27:05.380]  I'm going to try doing that.
[27:05.760 --> 27:06.180]  You should.
[27:07.040 --> 27:10.060]  Actually, I'm not going to do that on my computer because it's slow.
[27:10.240 --> 27:11.360]  And I don't want to fuck up the recording.
[27:11.360 --> 27:13.160]  Yeah, please do it on my phone.
[27:15.500 --> 27:16.440]  I'm going to try this.
[27:16.520 --> 27:18.180]  It's been in my fridge for like two weeks.
[27:18.520 --> 27:19.540]  I've been curious about it.
[27:20.460 --> 27:21.340]  I want to see what this is.
[27:21.740 --> 27:23.120]  I haven't had it since I was young.
[27:23.320 --> 27:26.120]  But I think it's just a sparkling apple.
[27:26.620 --> 27:27.860]  Yeah, can you describe it?
[27:28.120 --> 27:29.360]  Can you describe it for us, Gavin?
[27:29.560 --> 27:31.680]  I don't know. I don't understand what appletizer is.
[27:31.740 --> 27:33.580]  It's just like a sparkly apple drink?
[27:34.260 --> 27:36.560]  Appletizer is a nice sparkling apple drink.
[27:36.560 --> 27:41.260]  And if your grandparents offer it to you, they'll probably call it appletize for some reason.
[27:41.620 --> 27:43.380]  That's all that's happened in my experience.
[27:43.660 --> 27:45.020]  But I remember liking it.
[27:45.600 --> 27:46.080]  Delicious.
[27:46.620 --> 27:46.740]  Okay.
[27:47.220 --> 27:49.900]  I said that it sounds exactly like Martinelli's.
[27:50.120 --> 27:52.200]  Just foreign Martinelli's, which I am a fan of.
[27:53.280 --> 27:54.960]  Are you going to show us?
[27:55.300 --> 27:56.040]  Yeah, I'm going to.
[27:57.240 --> 27:57.960]  Ooh, that was good.
[27:58.400 --> 28:00.540]  Gavin, where do you think appletizer was invented?
[28:02.320 --> 28:03.880]  Oh, I'd say the UK.
[28:04.440 --> 28:05.560]  Oh, you'd be wrong.
[28:05.680 --> 28:08.460]  But you guys do think you're the center of the universe, so that makes sense.
[28:08.780 --> 28:14.640]  It was created in 1966 in the Western Cape of South Africa.
[28:15.120 --> 28:16.940]  So it is actually a South African thing.
[28:17.140 --> 28:17.360]  Yeah.
[28:18.260 --> 28:18.800]  That's cool.
[28:19.140 --> 28:19.800]  Is this fizzy?
[28:20.560 --> 28:21.200]  Should be.
[28:21.780 --> 28:21.960]  Okay.
[28:24.980 --> 28:26.080]  Oh, come on.
[28:26.940 --> 28:27.960]  Oh, come on.
[28:28.140 --> 28:28.300]  Oh, come on.
[28:28.300 --> 28:28.900]  Come on.
[28:29.540 --> 28:30.720]  You pour it in your lung?
[28:30.880 --> 28:31.760]  Why would you...
[28:36.210 --> 28:37.750]  I thought I could do the chug.
[28:38.290 --> 28:40.490]  I thought I was going to surprise you both with the chug.
[28:41.090 --> 28:42.010]  It did not work.
[28:43.270 --> 28:43.990]  You chugged.
[28:45.110 --> 28:45.910]  You went all in.
[28:46.410 --> 28:46.770]  Yeah.
[28:47.250 --> 28:50.270]  I'm not going to say what it tastes like, I'm going to pour the whole thing down my gut.
[28:50.270 --> 28:53.190]  I don't feel like I actually know how it tastes and I'm halfway through the can.
[28:53.190 --> 28:53.930]  Well, no shit.
[28:54.370 --> 28:55.130]  Let's try this.
[28:55.150 --> 28:55.970]  You chugged on it.
[28:56.530 --> 28:57.230]  Oh, wow.
[28:57.870 --> 29:00.130]  I've got appletizer facts whenever we're past this.
[29:00.310 --> 29:01.250]  This kind of sucks.
[29:01.890 --> 29:02.030]  Oh.
[29:02.490 --> 29:03.210]  This is not...
[29:03.210 --> 29:09.430]  I mean, it's not like something I would order, but I was saying if I had to have that instead of water, I would probably go with that flavor.
[29:10.150 --> 29:11.190]  I enjoy it.
[29:11.650 --> 29:13.870]  It's just carbonated apple juice, right?
[29:13.990 --> 29:14.170]  Yeah.
[29:14.250 --> 29:14.750]  It sounds lovely.
[29:15.030 --> 29:19.850]  But imagine it now, instead of choking on it, imagine it now as like a water substitute if you had to pick one.
[29:20.170 --> 29:21.630]  I definitely prefer the Martinelli's.
[29:21.970 --> 29:23.350]  Could you shower in it, Andrew?
[29:23.670 --> 29:25.210]  Or would it be really, really sticky?
[29:25.830 --> 29:27.010]  I imagine it's a lot of sugar.
[29:27.570 --> 29:28.390]  Is it very sweet?
[29:29.030 --> 29:30.150]  It's definitely tart.
[29:30.950 --> 29:31.170]  Yeah.
[29:31.750 --> 29:33.030]  It's a sourness to it.
[29:33.030 --> 29:36.110]  Yeah, I could shower in this.
[29:36.810 --> 29:37.910]  It would be very sneaky.
[29:38.430 --> 29:41.490]  I think I would shave my head, though, if I was going to do the shower thing.
[29:42.290 --> 29:45.710]  I feel like any hair, the amount of... you remove as much hair as possible.
[29:50.780 --> 29:54.160]  Imagine you're walking down the street and a bird poops all over your arm.
[29:54.360 --> 29:56.500]  Are you just going to pat it off with a dry napkin?
[29:56.820 --> 29:57.220]  No!
[29:57.640 --> 29:58.940]  You'd wash it off with water.
[29:59.220 --> 30:01.660]  So why are we treating our buttholes any differently?
[30:01.660 --> 30:07.660]  Stop smearing your business around with toilet paper and start washing with water with the Hello Tushy bidet.
[30:07.860 --> 30:10.500]  Hello Tushy bidets are a fantastic product.
[30:10.660 --> 30:11.720]  They're so easy to set up.
[30:12.160 --> 30:14.580]  It elevates your bathroom no matter what it is.
[30:14.660 --> 30:15.540]  This is fantastic.
[30:16.100 --> 30:18.920]  So stop spreading your business around your butthole with toilet paper.
[30:19.380 --> 30:21.340]  Start washing with Hello Tushy bidets.
[30:22.020 --> 30:27.040]  The Hello Tushy bidet attachment washes your bum with fresh water for a way better clean than toilet paper.
[30:27.420 --> 30:29.200]  Simply spray and pat dry.
[30:29.200 --> 30:31.200]  It attaches to your existing toilet.

[31:11.000 --> 31:13.040]  We're getting into the holiday season.
[31:13.200 --> 31:17.140]  It's a great time to buy gifts and there's no better place to do it than the Rooster Teeth store.
[31:17.380 --> 31:21.800]  No matter what your fandom is, as far as Rooster Teeth goes, they probably have a bundle for you.
[31:21.920 --> 31:24.000]  Such as the Achievement Hunter Fall Bundle.
[31:24.000 --> 31:27.240]  You can layer up a new Achievement Hunter Fall Collection and save.
[31:27.640 --> 31:33.460]  Pick out any two pieces from the collection and get a third for free with code AHB2G1 at checkout.
[31:33.760 --> 31:35.700]  As well as the Face Jam BBQ Bundle.

[31:44.480 --> 31:51.680]  Most importantly though, is there's plenty of wonderful f***face merch including the Anal Passage T-shirt.
[31:51.840 --> 31:55.920]  Which at one point, y'all made the number one selling shirt on the store for 2022.
[31:56.420 --> 31:58.060]  Which is absurd. I love it.
[31:58.680 --> 32:00.660]  It has unfortunately dropped down to two.
[32:01.160 --> 32:07.600]  So if you're looking at getting some f***face merch before December 14th, which is the cutout to receive it at Christmas.
[32:08.020 --> 32:11.960]  Consider the Anal Passage, but we got all sorts of things that you could possibly enjoy.
[32:12.700 --> 32:13.520]  Ridiculous shirts.
[32:13.520 --> 32:16.940]  Thank you so much for supporting our show and supporting the content in general.
[32:17.360 --> 32:22.100]  I hope you're having a wonderful time over these holiday festivities.
[32:23.040 --> 32:25.360]  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[32:25.740 --> 32:30.080]  There's so many times in life when you're going through an issue, whether it be personal or work.
[32:30.420 --> 32:34.420]  Whatever it is, just having a user manual would make it so much easier.
[32:34.500 --> 32:36.960]  But unfortunately, life doesn't come with a user manual.
[32:37.180 --> 32:40.240]  So when it's not working for you, it's normal to feel stuck.
[32:40.240 --> 32:43.380]  Navigating any of life's challenges can make you feel unsure.
[32:43.820 --> 32:46.940]  Whether it's a career change, a new relationship, or becoming a parent.
[32:47.660 --> 32:52.760]  Therapists are trained to help you figure out the cause of challenging emotions and learn productive coping skills.
[32:53.080 --> 32:57.340]  Which makes therapy the closest thing to a guided tour of the complex engine called you.

[33:12.040 --> 33:14.400]  So if you're somebody who's going through something, I'd highly recommend it.
[33:14.440 --> 33:18.780]  Even if you're not necessarily. It's just a really healthy process to go through.

[33:54.920 --> 33:56.600]  Do you have hair right now?
[33:57.040 --> 33:57.860]  I do, yeah.
[33:58.360 --> 33:59.260]  How much hair do you have?
[33:59.260 --> 34:01.960]  Several. Several. Several pieces of hair.
[34:01.960 --> 34:03.040]  Do you have long hair?
[34:04.700 --> 34:05.520]  Parts of it are.
[34:06.800 --> 34:09.040]  What the fuck is that? Do you have a mohawk or something?
[34:09.240 --> 34:13.400]  No, it's different. Some areas of my hair are longer than other areas. It's kind of annoying.
[34:14.180 --> 34:16.880]  Do you have like a cool shag haircut or something?
[34:17.540 --> 34:23.600]  Well, it's just I got a part of my hair that's longer than the other parts and I keep trimming that part because I'm not ready for a full haircut yet.
[34:23.660 --> 34:25.120]  But the one part of it is too long.
[34:25.120 --> 34:26.020]  You're not seeing your guy?
[34:26.020 --> 34:31.820]  No, I'm seeing my guy. I want to see the guy, but I don't, you know, I'm trying to space out my haircuts a little bit.
[34:31.960 --> 34:34.460]  Are you cutting your own hair?
[34:35.100 --> 34:37.260]  Well, I'm cutting part of my own hair.
[34:37.760 --> 34:42.320]  Okay, so the answer to my question is yes. So the answer is yes, you are cutting your own hair.
[34:42.640 --> 34:46.640]  Yeah, because it's in front of my face and it gets in my eyes.
[34:47.220 --> 34:50.720]  So you've just cut a hole in the front of your head that you can see through, but the rest is long.
[34:50.720 --> 35:00.860]  I chop off the part that's longer and then I think it grows faster than the other parts because the other parts I don't feel like I need cut, but that part is an annoyance, so I cut it.
[35:01.260 --> 35:03.600]  And eventually it will all sync up again and we'll be good.
[35:08.820 --> 35:13.160]  No, I don't want to. That seems like an annoyance. I don't need it yet.
[35:13.420 --> 35:18.740]  I'm happy with the length of my... 95% of my hair, I'm happy with the length of.
[35:18.740 --> 35:20.640]  This is 5%.
[35:20.640 --> 35:28.860]  So you've just cut, that's exactly, Geoff, 100% Bruce Valanche in my head. Exactly what I thought. 100%.
[35:28.860 --> 35:35.240]  I was going to ask you, before you sent that, I was going to say, do you think Andrew has a Bruce Valanche haircut, Geoff?
[35:35.420 --> 35:35.760]  Yes.
[35:35.960 --> 35:37.080]  And then you sent the picture.
[35:39.500 --> 35:40.800]  How accurate is that, Andrew?
[35:41.760 --> 35:52.720]  Um, yeah, it's, it's, I, yeah, it's there. I mean, you wouldn't say I would show up as like a second cousin if this was Ancestry.com on that hair.
[35:55.040 --> 35:58.980]  It's not the same, but they're definitely related. They're in the same ballpark.
[36:01.580 --> 36:02.420]  They're close.
[36:03.580 --> 36:07.260]  Is that why, is that why you're not coming here yet? Because you're waiting until after your haircut?
[36:08.460 --> 36:10.420]  No, absolutely not. I haven't been invited.
[36:11.160 --> 36:19.200]  If you, if we invited you today and we booked you a plane ticket for next week, would you get a haircut before you came or would you just roll with what you have?
[36:19.620 --> 36:21.420]  I'd have to see the availability of my guy.
[36:22.160 --> 36:24.320]  You'd be, you'd be interested in getting a haircut though.
[36:26.580 --> 36:27.600]  You'd consider it.
[36:28.020 --> 36:30.560]  I would consider it. Yeah. When, when, when is this flight?
[36:31.100 --> 36:31.920]  It's next Wednesday.
[36:31.920 --> 36:37.000]  Wednesday? Hmm. I don't know if he's open on weekends, like Sundays, Friday.
[36:37.440 --> 36:40.140]  I'd have to leave on Tuesday just to get to Vancouver.
[36:41.020 --> 36:42.020]  That's true. A lot of time.
[36:42.860 --> 36:49.240]  Yeah, no, I, I think, uh, I think I, at this point I wouldn't get a haircut off this conversation.
[36:51.020 --> 36:52.140]  Well, that's where I would stay.
[36:52.460 --> 36:56.800]  Sorry. I had a burp that was like hitting me every inch of the way up.
[36:56.800 --> 37:00.400]  Like it was bounced like a pinball is this bouncing left and right up the throat.
[37:00.560 --> 37:03.440]  And I just couldn't, I was like trying to Bob and weave it out of my body.
[37:03.540 --> 37:04.180]  That was terrible.
[37:04.840 --> 37:11.960]  So I would tell you say out of 10 out of 10, uh, probably like a 5.5.
[37:12.080 --> 37:15.080]  Okay. But what about as a water substitute in all your faucets?
[37:15.540 --> 37:18.060]  I'd rather have whole milk and just make chocolate milk all week.
[37:18.140 --> 37:21.220]  Would it, would it taste better if it was made out of a cosmic crisp apple?
[37:22.020 --> 37:23.140]  Absolutely. Okay.
[37:23.140 --> 37:26.460]  Should we carbonate our cosmic crisp apple juice?
[37:27.300 --> 37:28.820]  Yes. Yes. I think we should.
[37:29.920 --> 37:30.300]  Should we?
[37:30.720 --> 37:32.360]  How hard is it to make your own apple juice?
[37:32.360 --> 37:33.180]  That's too gross.
[37:33.380 --> 37:34.520]  You just press apples out.
[37:34.700 --> 37:35.320]  Right. Yeah. Right.
[37:36.180 --> 37:38.880]  Then maybe sieve it, then maybe put it in a soda stream.
[37:39.540 --> 37:48.000]  I thought you wanted Geoff to use the apple that's been in his fridge for almost a year and to put that in a cup and then like soda stream the cup.
[37:48.120 --> 37:49.440]  I thought that's what you meant by...
[37:49.440 --> 37:50.820]  That apple is poison.
[37:50.820 --> 37:54.960]  I will touch it to my tongue, but that's about as far as we're going to get with it.
[37:55.360 --> 37:57.260]  And I think I still have a couple of months to go on that.
[37:57.340 --> 37:57.740]  I'm not sure.
[37:58.240 --> 38:01.240]  I have an answer for your apple ties thing though, Gavin.
[38:02.460 --> 38:08.000]  In 1979, the Coca-Cola company purchased 50% stake in Appletizer.
[38:08.220 --> 38:10.360]  And I think that's when it was brought over to the UK.
[38:10.840 --> 38:13.360]  Somewhere between like 69 and 79.
[38:14.720 --> 38:17.280]  Then they launched red and white Grape-tizer.
[38:17.280 --> 38:28.720]  But then it had to be relaunched in the UK as Appletize due to complaints of the owners of the Tizer brand of soft drink, which I guess already existed in the UK.
[38:28.760 --> 38:30.200]  So it was actually called Appletize?
[38:30.800 --> 38:32.600]  Well, the saga is not over.
[38:32.920 --> 38:45.200]  So it was actually called Appletize in the UK until 2001 after lengthy negotiations, the makers of Tizer allowed the R to be added to UK branding again.
[38:45.200 --> 38:50.320]  So then they reclaimed the name in 2001 and were then able to rebrand it as Appletizer.
[38:50.580 --> 38:53.480]  That explains so much about my childhood.
[38:54.000 --> 38:54.420]  There you go.
[38:54.680 --> 38:57.200]  I could never figure out why everyone was calling it Appletize when it had an R on it.
[38:57.440 --> 39:01.440]  Because until 2001, they were forced to call it Appletize.
[39:01.760 --> 39:07.260]  Even though probably in South Africa and Japan, apparently it's a big export of Japan and also Spain.
[39:07.400 --> 39:07.860]  That's phenomenal.
[39:08.080 --> 39:09.440]  And there it was probably Tizer the whole time.
[39:10.060 --> 39:11.580]  Yeah, there you go. That's your answer.
[39:11.580 --> 39:15.820]  Why didn't every little copyright issue, they should have just taken off the last letter?
[39:16.920 --> 39:19.740]  Well, you know how Starfox in the UK is called Starwing?
[39:20.600 --> 39:21.920]  Should have just been called Starfo.
[39:22.220 --> 39:22.660]  Starfo?
[39:23.100 --> 39:23.360]  Yeah.
[39:24.980 --> 39:28.500]  Have you ever had Tizer before? Do you know what that is? T-I-Z-E-R?
[39:29.300 --> 39:30.020]  I don't know.
[39:30.400 --> 39:30.860]  What's in it?
[39:31.140 --> 39:37.880]  It is a red colored citrus flavored soft drink bottled in Cumbernauld and sold in the United Kingdom.
[39:38.320 --> 39:42.120]  The name originally comes from the phrase Tizer the Appetizer.
[39:42.320 --> 39:48.360]  It was launched in 1924 when it was known as a pick-up appetizer.
[39:48.580 --> 39:49.300]  Whatever the fuck that means.
[39:49.900 --> 39:54.100]  In 2007, the company stopped using Ed the Head as the mascot.
[39:54.220 --> 39:55.700]  You don't remember Ed the Head in England?
[39:57.800 --> 39:59.120]  I feel like I've heard the name.
[39:59.660 --> 40:02.960]  I feel like Ed the Head is a wrestler Eric would know a lot about.
[40:03.100 --> 40:05.720]  In a card over at Extreme. He'd have all the facts on Ed the Head.
[40:05.720 --> 40:07.680]  Ed the Head Tizer.
[40:10.020 --> 40:14.200]  Oh, weird. It looks like it's more like Max Headroom than anything else.
[40:14.700 --> 40:22.080]  I've never seen this before, but it looks like something that came out in 1994 with this guy's face.
[40:22.160 --> 40:27.960]  It looks like it's the most like, what's up Gen X kind of look to a can.
[40:28.080 --> 40:28.880]  It's really something.
[40:29.440 --> 40:30.400]  That's fantastic.
[40:31.840 --> 40:33.040]  Too powerful?
[40:33.040 --> 40:36.080]  Yeah, it was too powerful for the fucking internet.
[40:36.200 --> 40:37.940]  Eric was going to buy us all.
[40:38.160 --> 40:42.220]  Oh, I'm sorry. Were you saying something about me? Oh, that's interesting.
[40:43.100 --> 40:45.200]  You said that you were going to get us Nitro.
[40:45.260 --> 40:48.840]  Yeah, and finance still will not clear my card to buy Nitro for this server.
[40:50.100 --> 40:50.620]  Alright.
[40:51.240 --> 40:54.760]  You can tell it's Tizer time when your eyes are shut.
[40:55.580 --> 40:56.260]  That's a fucking...
[40:56.860 --> 40:57.040]  What?
[40:59.640 --> 41:00.680]  Ed the Head.
[41:01.220 --> 41:02.380]  Oh, it just took me to Iron Maiden.
[41:02.740 --> 41:06.580]  Is that an Elton John looking man it looks like you posted a photo of?
[41:06.800 --> 41:09.880]  I think he's meant to look like Elton John. I don't think it is actually Elton John.
[41:09.920 --> 41:11.080]  Oh, it's definitely not Elton John.
[41:11.140 --> 41:13.720]  You can tell it's Tizer when your eyes are shut. Whatever the fuck that means.
[41:15.580 --> 41:17.480]  I guess it's a distinctive taste?
[41:17.780 --> 41:20.320]  Yeah, it's like so good you gotta close your eyes to drink it.
[41:21.060 --> 41:21.420]  Interesting.
[41:22.420 --> 41:23.980]  No, I don't think I've ever had that.
[41:24.100 --> 41:28.160]  We need to get... we need to be on a mission to get Tizer.
[41:29.760 --> 41:30.680]  Probably easy to find.
[41:30.680 --> 41:32.900]  Buy it on Amazon right now.
[41:33.720 --> 41:35.680]  I think it's about time we do our crisp gauntlet.
[41:37.340 --> 41:38.560]  Crisp gauntlet? What do you mean by that?
[41:38.560 --> 41:39.520]  Oh yeah, we need crisps.
[41:40.600 --> 41:43.320]  Oh yeah, okay. Yeah. Chips, crisps.
[41:46.860 --> 41:47.740]  You okay, Geoff?
[41:47.880 --> 41:52.300]  Yeah, it just reminds me of something I wrote down that I wanted to talk to you guys about.
[41:52.360 --> 41:55.360]  Yeah, I want to hear your notes. We're 40 minutes into this. We gotta go through your notes.
[41:55.440 --> 41:58.440]  I had a dream. I had a dream idea and I don't know if it's good or not.
[41:58.440 --> 42:00.940]  Well, first off, here's my notes.
[42:01.420 --> 42:01.740]  Okay.
[42:02.500 --> 42:03.220]  Fuck Walmart.
[42:05.600 --> 42:09.240]  VCK mousepad update. I wanted to hear if Gavin started using it yet and what that's like.
[42:10.260 --> 42:14.860]  I was going to talk about weird sports and that idea you and I had. Maybe Andrew, but we can hold that off for whenever.
[42:16.320 --> 42:30.460]  Oh yeah, so the dream idea I had was we should... I like how the community makes these albums and I just think that's really cool and creative.
[42:30.580 --> 42:35.660]  And I was trying to think of other creative ways that we could create content together or create something together.
[42:36.100 --> 42:43.380]  And I was thinking about when I was in the Army, early on in the Army, on holidays when soldiers were too poor to go home,
[42:43.380 --> 42:50.080]  we would all get together in the common area of the barracks or whatever and everybody would have one recipe that was their family recipe.
[42:50.580 --> 42:55.960]  And we'd make a Thanksgiving dinner for all the wayward people that didn't have the money to go home to see their families.
[42:56.140 --> 42:58.280]  Or in some cases, just didn't have family to go home to.
[42:59.380 --> 43:02.320]  And you'd have a potluck Thanksgiving dinner.
[43:02.620 --> 43:05.720]  And I know Thanksgiving is a pretty American thing, which is why I'm on the fence about talking about it.
[43:05.720 --> 43:10.720]  I know you guys have a Thanksgiving in Canada, Andrew, but it's different.
[43:10.720 --> 43:15.400]  The whole point of Thanksgiving is that we were saying thanks for not being England anymore.
[43:16.620 --> 43:20.420]  So I imagine you people probably don't celebrate it as much.
[43:20.900 --> 43:22.600]  Fourth of July is also not a huge one for us.
[43:23.380 --> 43:28.000]  I cannot find Tizer on Amazon, so we're gonna have to do some work to get to Tizer.
[43:28.480 --> 43:36.220]  But I had this idea of maybe we could put together a community-sourced cookbook where everybody submits their Thanksgiving ideas.
[43:36.500 --> 43:38.640]  Like, oh, there's my family's cranberry recipe or whatever.
[43:38.640 --> 43:41.760]  And I think we could call it Deep Lore About Stuffing.
[43:43.620 --> 43:47.280]  Oh! I love it! That's fantastic!
[43:50.020 --> 43:50.920]  That's my idea.
[43:50.980 --> 43:55.420]  Deep Lore... oh, I hope there's no stuffing recipes in it. That's even better.
[43:55.920 --> 43:57.960]  Or it's just stuffing recipes.
[43:58.020 --> 43:59.880]  Or it's just... yeah, it's either or.
[44:00.200 --> 44:03.180]  I was trying to figure out how to work this into a bit.
[44:03.480 --> 44:07.980]  And my other idea was we all come up with five stuffing recipes and then we throw them into a hat.
[44:07.980 --> 44:12.020]  And then everybody pulls one and you have to make that stuffing recipe and it can't be your own.
[44:12.300 --> 44:15.300]  And then we have to make each other's stuffing recipes and then, you know, I don't know.
[44:15.360 --> 44:16.760]  Then we all eat them and see who we like the best.
[44:16.960 --> 44:20.040]  Do we just eat the stuffing or do we eat them as a part of a meal?
[44:20.640 --> 44:22.940]  I don't know. I think it's up for debate.
[44:23.700 --> 44:26.140]  I'm more into the name Deep Lore About Stuffing.
[44:26.240 --> 44:29.080]  That was the dream part. That was the part that I woke up and went...
[44:29.080 --> 44:34.060]  I just came up with the best name ever for content in my dream and I woke up with Deep Lore About Stuffing.
[44:35.720 --> 44:40.160]  So do we want to do this the next time we record? Is that our Deep Lore About Stuffing?
[44:40.180 --> 44:43.220]  Because it'll be around Thanksgiving. It'll be our Thanksgiving episode.
[44:43.420 --> 44:46.060]  I think if everybody went home...
[44:46.060 --> 44:50.420]  Because what? We're not going to record next week and we're probably not going to record the following week.
[44:50.460 --> 44:52.760]  But we may on an off day.
[44:52.920 --> 44:59.140]  But at a minimum, we have a week or so that we could all just come up with a stuffing recipe.
[44:59.140 --> 45:02.920]  You don't have to invent it. Just come up and talk to your family.
[45:03.480 --> 45:06.220]  See if they have a family stuffing recipe or just make your own up.
[45:06.320 --> 45:09.660]  Or find one in Better Homes and Gardens or whatever that you like.
[45:11.060 --> 45:12.640]  But it's an idea. I don't know.
[45:13.240 --> 45:15.240]  I would like to do it. I think it's a great idea.
[45:15.760 --> 45:18.580]  We don't even necessarily need to be made by the time.
[45:18.640 --> 45:20.800]  But we could talk about eating the stuffings.
[45:21.380 --> 45:25.240]  And it seems like a fun thing they could do. It's not like a product we'd sell or anything.
[45:25.240 --> 45:30.340]  Maybe a channel on the Discord server where everybody just shares their holiday recipes or something.
[45:30.800 --> 45:32.440]  Deep lore about stuffing.
[45:34.040 --> 45:38.760]  Which, by the way, you guys responded way more positively to the name than Emily did.
[45:39.500 --> 45:40.740]  Oh, it's a great name.
[45:41.120 --> 45:41.900]  She was like, okay.
[45:43.180 --> 45:44.940]  Oh, it's fantastic. I'm excited.
[45:45.860 --> 45:49.320]  As soon as we're done recording, I'm going into the stuffing books.
[45:49.580 --> 45:54.900]  I feel like stuffing is one of those things that everybody loves but you don't think about.
[45:54.900 --> 45:57.140]  It just shows up. It's like, oh yeah, there's a stuffing.
[45:58.120 --> 46:02.760]  I just feel like there's probably a lot of room for some real stuffing creativity.
[46:03.200 --> 46:05.560]  I think so. And it kind of goes back to the roots.
[46:05.680 --> 46:11.980]  I think unlike other previous invent your own food related items, we're all clear on what a stuffing is.
[46:12.600 --> 46:14.700]  There will be no disputes in that regard.
[46:15.720 --> 46:16.760]  I think this will go great.
[46:19.140 --> 46:23.220]  Here's what... and some people call it dressings, some people call it stuffing.
[46:23.660 --> 46:27.240]  At its most basic level, it's just...
[46:27.240 --> 46:27.480]  Dressing?
[46:28.220 --> 46:31.420]  Because Gavin is not American, I know.
[46:31.980 --> 46:33.180]  Well, we have stuffing in Christmas.
[46:33.640 --> 46:35.280]  Oh, you do? Okay, cool.
[46:35.580 --> 46:38.160]  Because it just looks like, god damn, everything is too powerful.
[46:38.440 --> 46:40.400]  I can't even show a picture of fucking stovetop stuffing.
[46:40.840 --> 46:42.360]  Do you know how much nitro is, by the way?
[46:42.780 --> 46:43.860]  Three bucks a month.
[46:44.580 --> 46:46.280]  Eric can't get approved for three bucks.
[46:46.520 --> 46:49.240]  Listen, it's not Eric. Eric's trying.
[46:49.800 --> 46:51.900]  Just some sort of a credit card snafu.
[46:53.060 --> 46:53.720]  Three bucks a month?
[46:54.080 --> 46:57.400]  I would fucking personally pay three bucks a month to be able to send stovetop stuffing.
[46:57.400 --> 46:59.980]  I'd have milk coming out of my taps for a week just to get nitro.
[47:03.020 --> 47:09.960]  So anyway, that's my idea for a fun little holiday thing we could do.
[47:10.780 --> 47:13.900]  And then my only other note was just fuck Walmart, dude.
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.020]  Just fucking fuck Walmart.
[47:16.480 --> 47:17.580]  Hey, have you been to Walmart recently?
[47:17.920 --> 47:22.820]  I'm not a Walmart fan, but I go there from time to time because they sell cards, you know?
[47:22.880 --> 47:24.760]  And so sometimes you get lucky and get a pack of Prism.
[47:25.400 --> 47:27.120]  Or like a blaster of Prism.
[47:27.740 --> 47:34.100]  And then during the whole Alphabet thing, Walmart, they just have a lot of variety, right?
[47:34.100 --> 47:42.460]  And so I was going to Walmart, that's where I got like the Utz chip, or the Utz cheese balls, and then the Uft pizza, and the Utty Utties, and all that stuff.
[47:43.540 --> 47:46.060]  And so I've been like going to Walmart lately.
[47:46.600 --> 47:48.980]  And I remembered why I stopped going to Walmart.
[47:49.720 --> 47:57.020]  I can't fucking stand any store on Earth that treats 100% of their customers like criminals.
[47:57.380 --> 48:03.720]  It's fucking bullshit that I can walk in and pick up a 24-pack of Diet Dr. Pepper...
[48:04.180 --> 48:15.340]  and then go to a checkout where I'm six feet away from a lady who's standing at the exit who's watching me buy one 24-pack of Diet Dr. Pepper.
[48:15.620 --> 48:17.680]  I know she's watching me because we're making eye contact.
[48:17.980 --> 48:21.720]  And then I pay for it, and then they give me a fucking paper receipt, which is...
[48:22.580 --> 48:23.940]  I don't know why we still need those.
[48:24.100 --> 48:29.480]  And then I have to walk up to that lady, and if I try to walk out past her, she puts her hands out and stops me,
[48:29.480 --> 48:34.700]  and looks at the receipt, and then studies it slowly, and then looks at the 24-pack of Diet Dr. Pepper,
[48:34.960 --> 48:36.640]  and then looks at it again, and then decides I'm cleared.
[48:37.080 --> 48:38.720]  Like, she's like, okay, you're clear to go.
[48:38.940 --> 48:44.200]  And I understand that it's a job, and people need to do the job, and we need to have jobs for people,
[48:44.420 --> 48:47.940]  and I'm sure, you know, it's... I appreciate that she's doing it.
[48:48.200 --> 48:51.800]  But fucking, like, have some common sense here.
[48:51.980 --> 48:57.560]  You watched me buy the goddamn Diet Dr. Pepper a foot and a half away from you.
[48:57.560 --> 49:01.540]  Like, I could... you could probably smell my cologne, we're so close.
[49:01.900 --> 49:06.560]  Like, don't make me go through, like, I'm trying to sneak out of Fort Knox with a gold bar.
[49:06.880 --> 49:10.180]  Jesus fucking Christ, it's Diet Dr. Pepper!
[49:10.580 --> 49:14.820]  It's not even... I'm holding it in my hand, it's not even in a bag, because it's one thing!
[49:14.980 --> 49:19.240]  Why do we have to pour over the fucking paper like she's grading a test?
[49:20.020 --> 49:24.920]  So you went in, you grabbed the thing of Diet Dr. Pepper, you bought the Diet Dr. Pepper, and then you left.
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.720]  That's the only item on the receipt.
[49:26.720 --> 49:30.820]  Yes! Go to any Walmart and buy anything!
[49:31.120 --> 49:32.060]  I'm gonna have to test this out.
[49:33.080 --> 49:36.100]  They treat you like a goddamn criminal!
[49:36.920 --> 49:42.180]  Well, no, it's a strange implication, because you have one item, and you can see that you only have one item.
[49:42.580 --> 49:46.420]  So if you're looking at the receipt, if you stole something, it wouldn't be there.
[49:46.600 --> 49:51.800]  It's almost like she was validating... it was like she was shocked that you came in only for Dr. Pepper.
[49:52.040 --> 49:55.460]  You must have attempted to buy something else, and you have left it behind.
[49:55.460 --> 50:02.600]  Is it because people who steal are more likely to buy just a single item to warrant just a trip through the checkout?
[50:04.020 --> 50:08.440]  What it is, is they don't trust their customers. And they treat their customers like shit.
[50:08.460 --> 50:09.740]  Didn't Fry's used to always do that?
[50:09.960 --> 50:13.560]  They make you verify that you bought the thing before you can leave.
[50:13.960 --> 50:15.620]  Like you're going through fucking security.
[50:16.480 --> 50:21.520]  Like there's a rope, and they have to verify it, and they open the rope and let you leave.
[50:21.700 --> 50:24.400]  It's fucking stupid. And Fry's did it too, and guess what?
[50:24.400 --> 50:26.360]  There ain't any Fry's around anymore.
[50:26.880 --> 50:33.140]  Oh, I loved Fry's. At Waitrose, the supermarket I worked at, we were told never to, like, intercept thieves.
[50:33.340 --> 50:34.860]  We just weren't allowed to, like, interact with them.
[50:35.180 --> 50:38.880]  I guess more likely to get in trouble and sued if you, like, injure them trying to get stuff off them.
[50:39.460 --> 50:42.500]  And a lot of the customers knew this.
[50:43.060 --> 50:48.600]  Like, some people would just walk in and just, like, grab a bottle of vodka, and just hold it over their head as they walked out, and just be like,
[50:49.180 --> 50:54.120]  And we would just have to be like, we didn't have to, like, get them much earlier, like, intimidate them.
[50:54.240 --> 50:56.340]  They'd have to, like, send managers to stand near them.
[50:56.900 --> 51:00.820]  But if they managed to somehow get, like, passed out of their aisle, they would just openly steal.
[51:00.960 --> 51:03.400]  And the police wouldn't ever come, and it'd be like, okay.
[51:03.840 --> 51:06.560]  Like, it was... it was kind of... I don't know.
[51:07.040 --> 51:08.360]  That's funny. I get it.
[51:08.360 --> 51:08.980]  It was kind of impressive.
[51:09.660 --> 51:14.540]  I get that theft is a problem, and that the store has to protect themselves.
[51:14.540 --> 51:29.200]  But you can't... assuming that every single person who buys something in their store from the age of 5 to 85 is a hardened criminal who you have to verify their purchases 100% of the time.
[51:29.280 --> 51:30.840]  It's just... it's not a way to do business.
[51:31.320 --> 51:34.920]  And it reminds me why I stopped... I stopped going to Walmart because of this.
[51:35.080 --> 51:41.320]  Because I got into a fucking fight with a security guard when I was 19 years old because I had the audacity to buy a record player.
[51:41.320 --> 51:45.660]  And the guy... and the guy, like... I almost got into a physical altercation with the guy.
[51:45.960 --> 51:49.660]  And he fucking threatened me because he's just, like, standing... and I get it.
[51:49.740 --> 51:53.180]  I was 19. I was this 19-year-old, like, goofy punk rock kid.
[51:53.340 --> 51:55.940]  I looked like a criminal, which is why I had a little bit of patience.
[51:56.120 --> 51:58.460]  But the guy's, like, standing at the receipt, and he's looking at the record player.
[51:58.520 --> 52:02.460]  And I'm like, if you're having trouble reading it, I can help you with any of the harder words.
[52:02.620 --> 52:06.260]  And he, like, scowls at me, and I'm like, no, seriously, it seems like you're having some issues here.
[52:06.780 --> 52:09.960]  Just let me point out what you don't get, and I'll tell you.
[52:09.960 --> 52:12.100]  And then he, like, yelled at me, and then I yelled at him.
[52:12.220 --> 52:14.320]  And then, like, somebody else had to get involved. It was a whole thing.
[52:14.360 --> 52:16.340]  And I was just like, fuck it. I'm not going back to Walmart ever again.
[52:16.460 --> 52:19.040]  And I stayed pretty true to that for about 20 years.
[52:19.180 --> 52:21.740]  And now I'm wishing I had... I'd stuck to my ground.
[52:21.840 --> 52:23.280]  Because they're still doing the same bullshit.
[52:23.680 --> 52:26.840]  They were doing it in 1995, and they're doing it in 2022, and I hate it.
[52:27.300 --> 52:28.880]  I want to go and see if it's a U thing.
[52:29.020 --> 52:30.720]  I don't remember the last time I was in a Walmart.
[52:30.880 --> 52:32.800]  It must have been, like, five years ago or something.
[52:32.860 --> 52:34.660]  But I want to go and buy something and see if I get stopped.
[52:34.860 --> 52:37.360]  Yeah, I don't think I've ever been stopped, but it's a Canadian thing.
[52:37.620 --> 52:39.040]  They're the greeters, famously.
[52:39.040 --> 52:41.320]  Yeah, they got greeters. Love the greeters.
[52:41.500 --> 52:42.220]  Greeters are great.
[52:43.140 --> 52:43.780]  Love the greeters.
[52:43.800 --> 52:44.480]  I don't think I've ever been checked.
[52:44.500 --> 52:49.060]  They welcome you into the store, and then they say, fuck you on the way out.
[52:50.340 --> 52:51.940]  It's like, welcome to Walmart.
[52:52.460 --> 52:53.580]  Have a great day shopping.
[52:53.760 --> 52:56.160]  And on the way out, they're like, hey, fuck you, you criminal. Don't come back.
[52:56.160 --> 52:59.080]  So what am I buying? Just a 24-pack of drink or something?
[52:59.540 --> 53:01.940]  Buy a 24-pack. Buy a 12-pack.
[53:02.200 --> 53:02.920]  But I don't give a shit.
[53:03.180 --> 53:03.800]  Buy anything.
[53:04.140 --> 53:05.020]  Buy a candy bar.
[53:05.020 --> 53:09.580]  And then watch them treat you like you're trying to fucking rob a liquor store.
[53:10.380 --> 53:12.380]  Now, you seem to be against the paper receipt.
[53:12.500 --> 53:14.840]  I'm a big fan of the paper receipt, personally.
[53:15.320 --> 53:19.500]  Because sometimes, I'm going to be honest, I feel like if I go into a store,
[53:20.020 --> 53:25.040]  let's say I go into a drugstore, and I buy a 500ml bottle of soda,
[53:25.520 --> 53:30.220]  I then go into a grocery store, if I don't have a receipt for that bottle,
[53:30.300 --> 53:31.460]  I feel like I'm living dangerously.
[53:31.920 --> 53:34.900]  I feel like everyone's going to assume that I'm stealing it from that store.
[53:34.900 --> 53:38.660]  If you're bringing new merchandise into stores, I would never do that.
[53:40.300 --> 53:42.400]  I would just leave it in the car, I guess.
[53:43.720 --> 53:45.200]  No, they're right next to each other.
[53:45.280 --> 53:48.300]  I'm not going to go all the way back to the car to put one bottle in the car
[53:48.300 --> 53:49.680]  and then go back in and get groceries.
[53:49.880 --> 53:53.320]  I might go into one place because they have...
[53:53.800 --> 53:55.920]  Nerds Gummies is something that is not everywhere.
[53:56.040 --> 53:57.520]  Very important, essential item.
[53:58.060 --> 54:01.420]  I just mean like handheld things that, even if they don't have it in their inventory,
[54:01.560 --> 54:03.600]  I just feel like, ooh, this looks... I feel like I'm being sneaky.
[54:03.600 --> 54:07.580]  I just feel like most stores have a camera, so they can see you walking in with it.
[54:07.960 --> 54:09.860]  Yeah, but who is that person?
[54:09.960 --> 54:13.120]  That just feels like a lot of people having to have a talk over something.
[54:13.280 --> 54:17.200]  It's not actually a concern. Nobody's ever going to stop me, I don't think.
[54:17.700 --> 54:19.620]  But it's just in my head, I'm always like, ooh.
[54:20.000 --> 54:21.240]  And that's why you're a receipt guy?
[54:21.860 --> 54:24.000]  That's why I'm a receipt guy. I like having the thing.
[54:24.500 --> 54:28.600]  But this could also be influenced by the fact that I had those shorts that would set off the alarm.
[54:29.900 --> 54:32.940]  I actually completely understand that reasoning.
[54:32.940 --> 54:34.300]  I think that makes total sense, Andrew.
[54:34.480 --> 54:38.920]  I'll say that in the way I frequent stores, that never comes up.
[54:39.320 --> 54:40.460]  Very, very rarely comes up.
[54:40.780 --> 54:42.800]  But I'm a big fan of the no receipt button.
[54:43.800 --> 54:45.860]  Yeah, that's great. Give me a chance.
[54:46.140 --> 54:49.660]  I would just much rather not print more paper into the world.
[54:50.160 --> 54:54.640]  Well, you're lucky you had that receipt, Geoff, because I believe their policy is if you don't and you go there,
[54:54.760 --> 54:58.340]  you have to do a lie detector test right outside the door, right in the front.
[54:58.460 --> 55:01.840]  If they can't check that, it's a way more extensive process.
[55:02.480 --> 55:05.560]  That's why I keep a penny in my shoe at all times.
[55:06.480 --> 55:08.660]  Just in case I have to do an impromptu lie detector.
[55:08.780 --> 55:12.100]  I don't know if you know this, but if you put a penny under your big toe and focus on it,
[55:12.120 --> 55:13.520]  supposedly you can pass any lie detector.
[55:13.900 --> 55:16.880]  Oh, I always heard it was like a pin, that you had to do something to...
[55:16.880 --> 55:19.200]  I've never heard the penny. That's way better than a pin.
[55:19.200 --> 55:23.420]  You just focus on the penny and touch it with your foot. I don't know why.
[55:23.960 --> 55:28.520]  That's a fascinating... what a weird concept of having a device that can tell when someone's lying.
[55:28.520 --> 55:33.300]  Well, apparently it doesn't work very fucking well because they're all inadmissible in all courts.
[55:33.800 --> 55:34.100]  Yes.
[55:35.380 --> 55:40.160]  Could you imagine having to rely on a PlayStation to prove your innocence?
[55:40.420 --> 55:43.560]  Just the idea of a piece of tech being the thing?
[55:43.940 --> 55:48.160]  It's an absurd idea. It shouldn't ever be used as an only metric.
[55:48.740 --> 55:51.620]  Especially considering you're not even really relying on the machine as much
[55:51.620 --> 55:55.360]  as how somebody interprets a bunch of squiggly lines on a machine.
[55:58.780 --> 56:04.080]  They're like, I don't know, these lines, they go up and then they go down, and that tells me you're lying.
[56:04.840 --> 56:07.080]  It's like, what other direction do they go? Well, they only go up and down.
[56:07.260 --> 56:10.240]  Do they ever go just flat? No, no, they don't do that. They always go up and down.
[56:10.580 --> 56:15.760]  So they're going up and down, but I'm lying, but they're going up and down, and he's not lying.
[56:15.840 --> 56:16.500]  And they're like, yeah, totally.
[56:17.480 --> 56:21.100]  Could you imagine if they designed it so up and down meant you were telling the truth?
[56:21.360 --> 56:24.820]  Like the machines as the baseline were constantly going up and down?
[56:27.420 --> 56:29.840]  What's the baseline? How do they know that a machine is working?
[56:30.080 --> 56:34.140]  What are they? They ask you some questions, like some basic, like, what's your name?
[56:35.060 --> 56:37.600]  What color is this? And I don't know.
[56:37.720 --> 56:41.520]  Wouldn't you just lie about those baseline questions just to throw the whole thing out of whack?
[56:42.200 --> 56:44.320]  You could, I guess, theoretically, but I don't know.
[56:44.540 --> 56:47.320]  I've never taken a polygraph before. I haven't either.
[56:48.260 --> 56:52.480]  I think I've only seen it in crime shows, and they don't really go into the specifics of how that works.
[56:52.480 --> 56:56.340]  Like an A&E, middle-of-the-day murder mystery type show.
[56:56.420 --> 57:01.120]  They always have the scene where it's like a montage of what it looks like, but you never see anyone actually use it.
[57:02.480 --> 57:04.460]  It's just weird. It's a weird device.
[57:04.940 --> 57:09.540]  Hey, as we're wrapping up, and I realize because we're recording this a bit in advance because of vacations and holidays and stuff,
[57:09.640 --> 57:11.580]  do you guys think Eric is good at Frisbee yet?
[57:12.980 --> 57:16.080]  I bet we've already filmed him throw.
[57:16.560 --> 57:21.140]  Okay. So probably. He's probably better today than he was before the previous episode. That's good.
[57:21.140 --> 57:24.080]  Why don't we fly Andrew in for the f*** face Winter Olympics?
[57:24.700 --> 57:26.740]  Okay. I need time. Frisbee. Darts.
[57:27.360 --> 57:29.600]  You need time? To what? To get a haircut?
[57:29.980 --> 57:30.280]  If I'm going to compete, I need time to train. Yeah.
[57:31.660 --> 57:36.840]  To train, I've got to get my darts down. If I'm representing my country, I take that very seriously, Eric.
[57:36.940 --> 57:39.280]  I need to practice some cornhole. We've got three countries.
[57:40.920 --> 57:45.220]  I need darts. My darts average is terrible, is my belief.
[57:45.340 --> 57:46.660]  I've got zero dart confidence.
[57:46.820 --> 57:50.500]  Yeah, but Canada can't postpone the Olympics when the Olympics are on.
[57:50.500 --> 57:51.440]  That is true.
[57:51.540 --> 57:54.640]  Oh, you watch it. You watch it right now. It's happening.
[57:55.980 --> 57:59.320]  We give you the date, and then if you want to enter your country...
[57:59.320 --> 58:04.720]  Yeah, but the Olympics also don't say they're happening next week, Gavin. There's four years.
[58:05.340 --> 58:07.800]  You need to wait four years? You have time to train.
[58:08.560 --> 58:13.020]  Honestly, Andrew would make it last four years. If he could not come here for four years, that's what we'd be waiting on.
[58:13.080 --> 58:18.520]  Okay, okay. Well, Andrew, how much time do you need so that we can put this on the books and get the flights worked out?
[58:18.520 --> 58:21.760]  How much time do you need to prepare to get ready for the f***face Olympics?
[58:22.080 --> 58:24.580]  I will say it's different on home turf, which I gotta say.
[58:25.280 --> 58:28.680]  Last I heard, crabbing. You're coming to crabbing at some point.
[58:29.320 --> 58:33.140]  I'm coming crabbing for a bachelor party. I'm not coming crabby.
[58:34.720 --> 58:38.940]  I'll probably be crabby. I'm not coming crabbing to do the Olympics. Those are two different trips.
[58:39.360 --> 58:40.760]  Could crabbing be an Olympic event?
[58:41.200 --> 58:41.600]  Maybe.
[58:42.840 --> 58:45.520]  What if you had to be in Austin on the 15th of December?
[58:46.680 --> 58:48.220]  No. No, I can't do that.
[58:48.220 --> 58:49.780]  It's over a month away.
[58:50.300 --> 58:50.900]  I can't do that.
[58:50.980 --> 58:51.460]  How about February?
[58:51.900 --> 58:53.280]  What can't you do about it?
[58:53.960 --> 58:55.660]  It's my mom's birthday, December 15th.
[58:55.780 --> 58:56.420]  Oh, shit.
[58:57.300 --> 59:02.600]  How about mid-February? Because I'm busy in a lot of January. How about mid-February? Can you come in February?
[59:02.860 --> 59:05.500]  Mid-February? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I have no plans on mid-February.
[59:05.880 --> 59:13.260]  Hang on. Hang on. That wasn't a yes. That was, I have no plans in February.
[59:13.620 --> 59:16.660]  Andrew, can you commit to coming in February?
[59:16.660 --> 59:20.960]  I'm just trying to, like, remember everything Gavin says when he's scheduling anything at this show.
[59:21.100 --> 59:26.260]  Uh, yeah. I'll just say yes, and then I'll say no as soon as we're done. Yes.
[59:26.420 --> 59:28.420]  You are... I... I...
[59:30.540 --> 59:32.820]  Doesn't it suck, Gavin? Isn't it annoying?
[59:33.520 --> 59:37.480]  But I was actually at a monkey movie. I was actually at pizza making.
[59:37.900 --> 59:38.860]  Yeah, I'll be in the Olympics.
[59:38.860 --> 59:43.280]  And I didn't say maybe in, you know, next quarter. It was like a week away.
[59:44.260 --> 59:45.040]  I'll be in the Olympics. I'll be in the Olympics.
[59:45.820 --> 59:51.180]  You guys are gonna hold the Olympics, you're like, Andrew never showed, then you're gonna realize all the fucking gold medals are gone.
[59:51.360 --> 59:52.980]  Sneaking into coming in.
[59:53.080 --> 59:54.400]  I can't take them all and go.
[59:55.280 --> 01:00:00.300]  It's gonna cut to me in the plane like MVP. I'm just sitting there with nine medals around me.
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:06.160]  We have until February to figure out what the Olympics are. I feel like they definitely have axe throwing.
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.660]  They definitely have cornhole. They definitely have darts.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:13.720]  They definitely have frisbee distance. The frisbee put.
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:17.080]  All these sound miserable to play in winter, but...
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:22.080]  Yeah, well, you know, it depends on which week in February it is. It's either gonna be 70 or 30.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:22.940]  True.
[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:27.520]  We'll go for late February. We should be fine. And then we can so we can work on any more.
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:31.920]  Well, this gives us time to get medals made for all the events and then an overall medal.
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:35.320]  This gives us time to get uniforms worked out. This is good.
[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:41.920]  I think I think pushing it to February, not even pushing it to February, just settling on February allows us some time to do some legitimate planning.
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:43.620]  I like it.
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:47.940]  But we are committing to doing... How often do the F*** Face Olympics happen?
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:52.620]  Which, by the way, I was shitting on the name F*** Face last episode. Saying F*** Face Olympics is the funniest thing in the world.
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.560]  So I'm back. I'm back on board with the f***ing name of our podcast.
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.260]  I think we can decide that after.
[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:00.840]  Every four years?
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.200]  That seems like too infrequent for a podcast.
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:07.480]  What if we did every three years?
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:11.340]  What about every other time Andrew gets a haircut?
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:12.860]  That's too often.
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:14.640]  How about every year?
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:21.620]  I think once a year is good because you can do winter and then you can do summer.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:22.640]  I agree.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:27.820]  Remember how often the freaking Minecraft Fishing Jamboree comes around?
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:31.220]  It'll be that. It'll be like, oh, how's it already the Fishing Jamboree again?
[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:32.480]  How about every 20 months?
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:39.460]  Now I will say that what we do for Face Jam is we have something called Jamsgiving, which is just like Thanksgiving,
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.680]  except it's just whatever we say it is.
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.000]  So it just it's a lot looser.
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.260]  It's just something to think about.
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:47.320]  Are you competing with Deep Lore About Stuffing?
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:51.600]  No, this Jamsgiving is what, a year old at this point.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.560]  So it sounds like you're competing with Jamsgiving.
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:55.460]  I'm just saying.
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:59.100]  I'm just putting this out there that we've established.
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:01:59.900]  I don't doubt that.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.040]  We've established that you can make it whatever you want it to be.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:06.480]  If Jamsgiving and Deep Lore About Stuffing are competing,
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.700]  I know which one's winning on the name alone right now.
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:18.140]  How do these podcasts cover so much of the same ground?
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.500]  It's almost as if people aren't that interesting.
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.640]  But OK, it sounds like we're good.
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:30.560]  It sounds like we're good for February and then we'll work out the logistics later.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:31.540]  That's great.
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:34.960]  And if anybody has any like new competitions they want to submit,
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:39.400]  I feel like we should probably have a good seven or eight if we can come up with them.
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:45.460]  I bet I can stick some Monopoly money to Andrew's door by the end of the year.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:46.300]  No way.
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:49.240]  The end of this year or the end of next year?
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:50.800]  The end of this year.
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:57.560]  So you're going to go up to Nanaimo covertly sometime in the next month and a half
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.880]  and stick Monopoly money on Andrew's door?
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:01.200]  With me not noticing?
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:02.440]  That's how sneaky I am.
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:04.100]  With me not noticing?
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:04.240]  Interesting.
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:08.340]  I bet you'll text me a picture of it and I'll already be back on my couch in Austin.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:10.960]  OK, deal.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.900]  There's no way that you do this.
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:14.080]  No?
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:15.140]  No.
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:15.940]  Zero percent chance.
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:16.540]  I'm going to catch you.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.080]  You won't catch me while you're watching your door?
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.000]  No, I just, I don't know.
[01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:22.560]  I'll fucking Kevin McAlister it.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.020]  I'm going to step into a trap.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.140]  There's going to be a fucking paint can that swings by.
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.460]  I'm going to grab the handle and then there'll be a pee burn into my hand.
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:29.280]  Yeah.
[01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:34.620]  I'm excited.
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.080]  OK, you're on.
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.800]  I don't even know what the steaks are for this.
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:41.000]  Steaks.
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:43.500]  The steaks.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:46.480]  Somebody has to buy the steak dinner.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:52.680]  The problem is, I don't know where Gavin lives, so I'm at a disadvantage because I was going to counter back and say I'd do the same for you.
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:53.520]  I don't know where you live.
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:54.000]  I live in Austin.
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:55.240]  Great.
[01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:57.180]  Hey, Andrew?
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:58.180]  Yeah?
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.220]  I can help you out there.
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:00.160]  OK.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:01.500]  OK, we'll figure it out.
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.820]  I mean, I don't know where Gavin lives either, but I can figure it out.
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:08.660]  Yeah, no, you know, you at least could patrol the streets and look for...
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:09.900]  I got a better shot at it than you do.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.840]  I know what his trash can looks like. I'll send you photos.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:16.760]  I'm excited.
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:18.000]  How about your trash can?
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:28.560]  Andrew, do you think you could get a bag of cucumbers on his front porch without him knowing or seeing it on any camera, without there being any evidence of it happening?
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:32.680]  I will get a bag of cucumbers there and I'm taking your trash can again.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:33.760]  You're going to have to order another one.
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.880]  Oh, man.
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.300]  I'm so excited to meet up eventually.
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.800]  I'm going to really be pushing for it.
[01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.060]  Well, it's happening in February.
[01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:50.380]  That's still so far away. I always get excited about November.
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:54.580]  Dude, February is not far away. It's going to go so fast.
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:59.640]  You're going to be so busy with the end of the year and the beginning of the year and all the trips and stuff.
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:05.160]  Aren't we potentially taking a beach vacation together between now and then?
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:06.620]  I hope so.
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.480]  I do too.
[01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:09.860]  I think that's the plan, though.
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.440]  I'm just excited to get my steaks.
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.960]  What's the best steak in Austin?
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:19.380]  I feel unqualified.
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:25.700]  There's a restaurant called Geoffrey's that's really fucking expensive, but really good.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.060]  What would you say are the top three?
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:30.760]  Can the winner pick their steak? What about that?
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:31.620]  Absolutely.
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:36.160]  Truelocks used to have this thing called Steak Dynamite, which was really good.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.240]  What was that?
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:43.020]  It was like a nice steak, but with shrimp and spicy sauce on top.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.620]  You know what my favorite part about winning this bet is, Geoff?
[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:49.880]  My favorite part about winning this bet is I'm going to win this steak.
[01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:51.300]  That's going to be my first prize.
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:54.740]  I'm going to go to Austin. I'm going to redeem this steak.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.780]  And Gavin is going to forget to show up to this steak dinner.
[01:05:58.020 --> 01:05:59.520]  And then I'm going to get a guilt basket.
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:00.400]  That's exciting.
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:01.340]  It's going to be a double win.
[01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:03.960]  We're stacking victories here.
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:05.840]  Are there any new consoles coming out any time soon?
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:07.400]  I don't think so.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.280]  We'll see.
[01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:19.460]  Or if you want, the winner can make the loser buy a cut of steak and then I can grill it for you.
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.360]  Although it would probably be better just to go to a restaurant.
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:22.560]  But I'm not bad.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.880]  No, I think that would be a good idea. I like that.
[01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:27.980]  I'm excited. Let's do this.
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.900]  That's my way of stealing some steak out of this.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.740]  So what's the actual bet?
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:34.760]  You have to put a dollar.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:37.820]  So what does being caught mean?
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:39.140]  Do I have to tag you?
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:40.420]  How does this work?
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:42.200]  You have to catch me doing it.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:45.600]  So I need to stop you in the act, essentially, to prevent it.
[01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:48.440]  Or alert him that you're aware that he's there.
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:49.420]  Okay.
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:51.060]  Okay.
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:57.780]  And I have to try to put a fucking cucumber on your door and steal your trash can from both of us.
[01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:01.320]  The cucumbers need to be in a bag and they need to be sweating.
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.300]  If we're going to be correct.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:08.640]  Now, Gavin, are you putting an American dollar, a Canadian dollar, or Monopoly money on his door?
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:09.300]  Or British?
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:11.120]  I'm probably going to put a Monopoly hundred on his door.
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:11.860]  Okay.
[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:13.300]  A Monopoly hundred.
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:15.180]  Interesting. Okay.
[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:17.740]  I'm excited.
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.060]  What's your door made of?
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:22.460]  What sort of fixings do I need to bring?
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:24.700]  That's for you to find out. I'm not going to give you any edges.
[01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:25.980]  I don't have your fucking address.
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:29.560]  I should probably bring, like, tape, or a magnet, or a screw.
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:32.640]  Don't screw. Don't use a screw.
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:33.940]  That'd be a bad idea.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.220]  Tape would work.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.220]  If you went with a screw, I would cease to have a door.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.320]  What do you mean?
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:46.860]  But then I guess I'd technically win the bet.
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:49.180]  If I just get rid of my front door.
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:51.440]  Well, you're going to be bringing it down with you anyway, right?
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.140]  Didn't we determine you were going to fly with it?
[01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:54.220]  That's true. That's a great point.
[01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:57.520]  I get to the door, it's just a door frame, and he's left.
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:04.440]  That's true. You can't put it on the door if he's hidden the door out in the woods somewhere.
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:05.960]  The door frame counts.
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:13.720]  That's a question. Now, does the door frame count?
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:14.740]  It has to.
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:17.600]  If Gavin goes there and you've removed the doors...
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.340]  Yeah, does the door frame count?
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.780]  He's taken the door frame.
[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:28.460]  Yeah, put it on the door frame, if you can find that.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.420]  Alright, so we've got a lot of stuff coming up, maybe.
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:34.360]  We either have a lot of stuff coming up, or we have nothing coming up.
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:38.440]  Yeah, I guess it'll depend on after we hit stop here and what Andrew says.
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:40.120]  Yeah, what Andrew really means.
[01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:42.600]  You're playing that on me?
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:47.040]  Wait, when do I say yes in the recording and say no the second we start?
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.540]  Literally the last time! The monkey movie!
[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:52.940]  The previous time, the monkey movie, you immediately said no!
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:54.580]  What was my reason for saying no?
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:57.900]  I don't remember, but as soon as we finish...
[01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:01.260]  If I ever do that, it's because there's new information I've remembered.
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:04.940]  I'm never like, oh, I'm saying yes now, but I'm definitely saying no afterwards.
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:07.680]  It's usually like, something else comes up.
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:09.960]  Or, you know, we have to change for something.
[01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:12.180]  I'm never, like, lying in the recording.
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:18.240]  Oh, Nick says, new information you remembered is all information, isn't it?
[01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:19.200]  That's correct, Nick.
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:20.300]  That's a great point.
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:21.320]  But that changes the intent.
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:27.720]  I gotta defend Andrew a little bit.
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:31.700]  There are some times when you say yes to something, and then 10 minutes later, as soon as we stop, we go,
[01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:34.700]  alright, so we're on for a Friday, and you go, well...
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:38.000]  Yeah, and there's no implication that at that time you...
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:38.900]  I don't think that's true.
[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:40.560]  I just gave you an example.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.280]  What was the example?
[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:44.960]  The MVP, oh, you're ridiculous, you fool!
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:47.160]  You didn't say what the MVP thing was!
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:51.840]  You said we'd all agreed, and then if you go in the episode...
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:53.880]  You're ridiculous. You're being ridiculous.
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:56.480]  But that was the information I had in the recording.
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.480]  Let's end the show! Let's end the show!
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:02.220]  What, did it fucking fly to you? Five minutes later, what do you mean?
[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:03.740]  I probably checked a calendar or something.
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:08.700]  Exactly! That's fine, but you did the thing, you did the act of saying I'm available,
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:11.100]  and then as soon as we stopped, being, oh, no, I can't.
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:14.520]  But the intent is different for you, because you already know you're saying no to this!
[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:21.620]  I'm so amazed that Eric is so quiet through this part, because I would love to hear his...
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.740]  Well, you know, maybe it's better we don't.
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.480]  Uh, we should probably wrap this up, right?
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:27.320]  We should!
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:29.880]  Alright. I'm also not sure that Eric is still here.
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:31.400]  You gotta go remove my door, I'll be back.
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:33.060]  I get the impression Eric went.
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:37.700]  Oh, no, I'm here. There's just nothing that I'm gonna do that's gonna solve anything,
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:41.540]  so I'm just waiting for it to end so we can figure out if it's something we're doing or not.
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:46.380]  Well, there you have it.
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:50.460]  Thank you for listening to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:53.740]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. I don't know why I said that, that's the beginning part.
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:58.560]  Strike that. I mean, I said it, don't delete it, but don't retain that information.
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:06.080]  Just go ahead and like and subscribe and tell a friend about F*** Face so that they'll like it too.
[01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:06.560]  Bye!
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:11.200]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:16.140]  The boys ate too much turkey and forgot to record an episode, so here's some predictions for what happens next week.
[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:18.260]  Eric forgets his Icy Hot again.
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:20.260]  Geoff made friends with a living turkey.
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:22.240]  Penn doesn't understand Thanksgiving.
[01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:23.860]  Gavin wants to move.
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:25.540]  What is the year's best movie?
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.460]  How did you celebrate Black Friday?
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:30.100]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:32.960]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:35.940]  I'm not available in Feb.
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:39.700]  I already knew that.
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:41.820]  F*** Face.
