[00:00.000 --> 00:05.520]  Hello! I am interrupting, I believe, the start of an episode, because this is... we recorded this
[00:05.520 --> 00:12.260]  ahead of time. We got nominated for a People's Signal Award as the Best Buddy Podcast, I believe,
[00:12.560 --> 00:17.080]  which is absurd. We're excited about it. We've never been nominated for an award before,
[00:17.580 --> 00:22.920]  so I'm here to talk about it and ask you to please vote for us if you wouldn't mind. It would be...
[00:22.920 --> 00:28.580]  to have an award-winning f*** face would be hilarious. On top of the fact that it is...
[00:28.580 --> 00:32.840]  for the Best Buddy category, which is an all-time flex to tell anybody in my life,
[00:32.920 --> 00:37.480]  I'm an award-winning friend. So please, if you wouldn't mind, I'm sure there are links in the
[00:37.480 --> 00:41.840]  show notes, give us a vote. We would really appreciate it. Thank you. Have a great day.
[00:42.100 --> 00:42.620]  Enjoy the episode!
[00:58.660 --> 01:03.300]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast. My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[01:03.340 --> 01:11.040]  With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Free. Episode 132. Eric is frustrated with us for
[01:11.040 --> 01:16.400]  scheduling. I apologize. But it sounds like we got it worked out. Sounds like we got it worked out.
[01:16.420 --> 01:19.860]  Do you ever think, like, eventually it won't be hard to schedule?
[01:20.320 --> 01:20.560]  No.
[01:20.700 --> 01:24.320]  I always feel like, you know, we get through this busy patch and then it'll be really easy.
[01:24.520 --> 01:27.220]  But it never is. It is always busy and it sucks.
[01:27.460 --> 01:32.700]  I agree with Geoff. No, it will never be easy. At no point will it ever get easier. It will just
[01:32.700 --> 01:38.020]  be this way and that is... it's my cross to bear and that's fine. We'll just figure it out and it
[01:38.020 --> 01:38.560]  is what it is.
[01:39.180 --> 01:43.240]  What was... was it the Olympics that were scheduled for the 15th originally?
[01:44.700 --> 01:49.080]  I thought there was, like, a December 15th at one point because I couldn't do it because of
[01:49.080 --> 01:53.480]  my mom's birthday. What was that? Oh, it's like that. That was the last time we recorded. That was
[01:53.480 --> 01:57.200]  the thing that Gavin wanted to do. I got heat for and somebody else is unavailable, I believe.
[01:57.340 --> 02:00.920]  I think you might be right. I think it might have been the Olympics, but we push that to,
[02:01.040 --> 02:04.960]  like, next February. So yeah. Yeah. Is it really your mom's birthday?
[02:05.520 --> 02:09.040]  It is. Oh, OK. You and birthdays, I never know what to believe.
[02:09.500 --> 02:11.160]  No, that's fair. Very understandable.
[02:13.080 --> 02:20.580]  As a subtle callback to Andrew lying about his birthday in season two of Survive Black Island.
[02:21.160 --> 02:24.880]  I got his cake. I feel like I should be rewarded for that move.
[02:25.340 --> 02:29.080]  Did people like our supplemental? I didn't really see it come out.
[02:29.360 --> 02:30.680]  Yeah, I think so. From what I saw.
[02:31.020 --> 02:31.840]  I have no idea.
[02:32.760 --> 02:34.120]  Oh, people... people loved it.
[02:34.120 --> 02:34.660]  Oh, great.
[02:35.040 --> 02:37.860]  I mean, it was it was the same complaints I think you guys had where you're like,
[02:38.280 --> 02:41.080]  oh, a bunch of this stuff didn't stuff didn't even make the episodes.
[02:41.440 --> 02:44.220]  And it's like, right, that's how these productions work, I think.
[02:44.380 --> 02:49.120]  But I think that just getting a glance into the mind of Andrew is always very exciting
[02:49.120 --> 02:52.540]  and entertaining. And then when you see the depths that he'll go to,
[02:52.620 --> 02:55.060]  I think that was very exciting for people to see.
[02:55.620 --> 02:58.580]  If we'd have recorded that after this season had come out,
[02:58.720 --> 03:01.320]  we would have been talking about entirely different stuff
[03:01.320 --> 03:03.840]  when it came to pointing out moments from the show.
[03:04.320 --> 03:08.760]  But yeah, but yeah, it was more additive, I guess, than I thought it would be.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.620]  Yeah, I'm happy with it. I'm glad people enjoyed it.
[03:13.000 --> 03:18.640]  Yeah, me too. Man, I got to say, Emily has a has a like a Christmas disco ball going
[03:18.640 --> 03:22.380]  in this office and he's making shadows come on the wall.
[03:22.500 --> 03:25.440]  And for the past hour, I keep thinking somebody's going to strangle me to death.
[03:25.920 --> 03:28.800]  Like, I just keep like, I don't know why, but like,
[03:28.800 --> 03:31.640]  the corner of my eye, I just keep seeing these shadows at the wall.
[03:31.820 --> 03:34.580]  And I keep thinking somebody's just about to put their arms around me and fucking just...
[03:34.580 --> 03:36.540]  Really? That's fascinating. Is that a shadow thing?
[03:36.620 --> 03:39.480]  Is that what you assume shadows? I don't know why. I don't know why.
[03:39.540 --> 03:42.140]  I just I don't know. Maybe it's because I'm facing against...
[03:42.140 --> 03:47.200]  Maybe because I'm in a room facing away from the door, facing toward a wall.
[03:48.080 --> 03:50.340]  You know, it's like it's a very vulnerable position.
[03:50.500 --> 03:52.600]  And then when the shadows... and I have headphones on,
[03:52.640 --> 03:54.820]  which mutes the ambient sound of the room.
[03:55.360 --> 03:57.640]  So it's like it puts me at a unique disadvantage
[03:58.220 --> 04:01.240]  to protect myself from stranglers, I realize. And so...
[04:02.300 --> 04:05.760]  Maybe Emily's trying to desensitize you to not flinch at shadows.
[04:06.160 --> 04:07.620]  Shit, do you think that's what she's doing?
[04:08.720 --> 04:12.020]  I did hate that, though. That was where my seat in Achievement Hunter was
[04:12.020 --> 04:13.600]  was with my back to the door.
[04:13.840 --> 04:16.860]  And any time I heard the door, I just immediately stand up and turn around.
[04:17.140 --> 04:17.880]  Just out of fear.
[04:18.660 --> 04:20.600]  Well, that's probably the safest thing you could have done.
[04:20.920 --> 04:21.140]  Yeah.
[04:22.060 --> 04:23.400]  That's self-preservation right there.
[04:23.620 --> 04:26.200]  I'm just going to assume I don't get strangled going forward.
[04:27.780 --> 04:28.800]  That's a good assumption.
[04:29.160 --> 04:29.560]  Yeah.
[04:30.400 --> 04:31.640]  You've avoided it so far.
[04:31.760 --> 04:33.400]  Do you guys have a lot to talk about this episode?
[04:34.960 --> 04:36.380]  Let's check the old notes.
[04:36.980 --> 04:38.200]  I have stuff at the end.
[04:38.440 --> 04:38.660]  Okay.
[04:39.060 --> 04:40.360]  Oh, should we just wait until the end?
[04:40.580 --> 04:41.860]  I just have random stuff.
[04:42.680 --> 04:44.160]  I'm excited to hear your random stuff.
[04:44.540 --> 04:48.660]  Okay, here's one. It's not a long story. It's not a long thing.
[04:48.800 --> 04:52.080]  But I was trying to come up with a life hack.
[04:52.420 --> 04:54.480]  Like a little thing you could do to improve your life.
[04:54.700 --> 04:56.280]  Like, you know, f***face presents life hacks.
[04:56.280 --> 04:59.080]  And I don't know that this qualifies as a life hack.
[04:59.860 --> 05:01.540]  I realized after I wrote it down.
[05:02.220 --> 05:03.360]  So I'll leave it up to you guys.
[05:03.400 --> 05:05.500]  But I do still think it has merit and value.
[05:05.620 --> 05:10.940]  Much in the same way, I guess, blow-drying my body is a life hack, right?
[05:11.160 --> 05:14.700]  And that's been incredibly successful for me these last few years.
[05:15.660 --> 05:17.040]  This is kind of a similar thing.
[05:18.040 --> 05:19.280]  And I didn't do this on purpose.
[05:19.760 --> 05:21.560]  But let me describe it like this.
[05:21.700 --> 05:23.020]  You guys know in Good Will Hunt...
[05:23.020 --> 05:23.540]  Not Good Will Hunting.
[05:23.720 --> 05:24.600]  Dead Poets Society.
[05:24.600 --> 05:27.640]  When Robin Williams, like, makes all the kids stand up on top of the chair.
[05:27.820 --> 05:28.980]  Or on top of their desks.
[05:29.060 --> 05:31.000]  And they see the room from a different perspective.
[05:31.240 --> 05:34.900]  And it teaches them to, like, change and think differently.
[05:35.640 --> 05:36.020]  Sure.
[05:36.740 --> 05:38.980]  I took a dump with sunglasses on the other day.
[05:40.120 --> 05:41.740]  And let me tell you.
[05:42.660 --> 05:44.180]  It's a different experience.
[05:44.980 --> 05:46.480]  Do you feel cooler doing it?
[05:46.580 --> 05:47.700]  Like, what is the shift?
[05:47.700 --> 05:49.700]  I 100% felt cooler doing it.
[05:49.880 --> 05:50.700]  And the reason...
[05:50.700 --> 05:51.940]  By the way, I didn't mean to...
[05:51.940 --> 05:54.380]  It wasn't like I set out to take a s*** with sunglasses on.
[05:54.600 --> 05:56.100]  I was coming home from a bike ride.
[05:56.700 --> 05:58.540]  And I thought I s*** my pants.
[05:59.720 --> 06:00.860]  Walking back into the house.
[06:01.040 --> 06:01.880]  And so I thought, oh, no.
[06:01.960 --> 06:03.340]  I could feel, like, a greasy fart.
[06:03.420 --> 06:04.460]  And then I could feel, like, a plop.
[06:04.500 --> 06:05.540]  And I went, like, oh, my God.
[06:05.660 --> 06:06.860]  I definitely s*** my pants.
[06:07.080 --> 06:09.280]  So I just ran inside to the bathroom.
[06:09.560 --> 06:10.180]  Pulled my pants on.
[06:10.500 --> 06:11.220]  Had not...
[06:11.220 --> 06:12.380]  It was a phantom s***.
[06:13.060 --> 06:13.740]  It was, like...
[06:13.740 --> 06:17.540]  It was, like, all the feeling of s***ing your pants with none of the s***.
[06:17.920 --> 06:19.280]  So then I just went and took a dump.
[06:19.400 --> 06:21.580]  But about halfway through the dump, I realized something was different.
[06:21.640 --> 06:22.520]  And then it dawned on me.
[06:22.520 --> 06:23.920]  I'm still wearing my sunglasses.
[06:23.920 --> 06:26.100]  And then I realized, I kind of like it.
[06:26.280 --> 06:26.600]  It...
[06:26.600 --> 06:28.220]  You know, bathroom lights are harsh.
[06:28.540 --> 06:29.300]  They're bright.
[06:29.780 --> 06:30.360]  This kind of...
[06:30.360 --> 06:31.140]  This kind of, like...
[06:31.140 --> 06:32.360]  Like, dims it a little bit.
[06:32.420 --> 06:33.380]  Makes it kind of a...
[06:33.380 --> 06:34.680]  Almost a cooler, like...
[06:35.660 --> 06:36.380]  Like, visibly...
[06:36.380 --> 06:38.160]  Visually and, like, aesthetically.
[06:38.460 --> 06:40.140]  You look cooler, like, wearing a leather ja...
[06:40.140 --> 06:41.980]  Wear a leather jacket while you dump, too, maybe.
[06:42.020 --> 06:42.320]  I don't know.
[06:42.620 --> 06:44.280]  Do you have to chill them up when you wipe, though?
[06:44.740 --> 06:44.900]  Yeah.
[06:45.140 --> 06:45.620]  Yeah, you do.
[06:45.800 --> 06:46.400]  It's a good idea.
[06:46.780 --> 06:48.760]  Like, these aren't the darkest sunglasses in the world.
[06:48.820 --> 06:50.200]  But you do want, like...
[06:50.200 --> 06:53.040]  You want your eagle-eye vision when you're checking how clean your butthole is, I think.
[06:53.840 --> 06:55.300]  Well, not if you're Andrew, but yeah.
[06:55.660 --> 06:56.040]  Well, yeah.
[06:56.460 --> 06:56.720]  But...
[06:56.720 --> 06:57.060]  So, anyway.
[06:57.260 --> 06:58.100]  Just throwing that out there.
[06:58.220 --> 06:59.000]  A little life hack.
[06:59.700 --> 07:02.800]  Try taking a dump with your sunglasses on and see how it feels.
[07:02.880 --> 07:04.460]  You might be pleasantly surprised.
[07:04.680 --> 07:07.260]  Do you think you'll leave a set of poop shades in there from now on?
[07:08.120 --> 07:08.500]  Ooh!
[07:08.780 --> 07:09.600]  That's a great question.
[07:09.740 --> 07:11.240]  That's, like, shit shades.
[07:11.600 --> 07:13.200]  Shit shades by Unifarm.
[07:14.380 --> 07:15.260]  Unifarm shit shades.
[07:17.740 --> 07:19.900]  Now, that's something to think about and look into.
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.860]  I was just using my regular sunglasses, but maybe I need...
[07:22.860 --> 07:25.380]  I mean, that sounds like a product for the old anal passage website.
[07:27.620 --> 07:33.680]  Do you think that it would be enough to persuade me into becoming a sunglasses guy?
[07:33.800 --> 07:33.900]  Yeah.
[07:33.980 --> 07:34.920]  Because I never wear...
[07:34.920 --> 07:35.820]  Okay, interesting.
[07:36.020 --> 07:36.120]  Yeah.
[07:36.140 --> 07:37.100]  You're not a sunglasses guy?
[07:37.700 --> 07:40.460]  No, I always feel like I'm too lame for them.
[07:40.580 --> 07:41.780]  So I've never worn them.
[07:41.840 --> 07:42.800]  I just feel uncomfortable.
[07:43.000 --> 07:44.460]  Just as a person, you don't qualify.
[07:44.640 --> 07:46.700]  As a person, yeah, I do not qualify.
[07:46.880 --> 07:48.340]  I'm not cool enough to wear sunglasses.
[07:48.560 --> 07:52.540]  Here, well, it's an absolute necessity in Texas where it's 110 degrees in the summer
[07:52.540 --> 07:55.860]  and the fucking sun just bounces off the concrete right into your brain.
[07:57.560 --> 07:59.500]  But I think this is a great...
[07:59.500 --> 08:01.940]  And, you know, maybe this is an instructive tool, too.
[08:02.200 --> 08:05.700]  Maybe if you're like Andrew out there and you don't feel comfortable wearing sunglasses
[08:05.700 --> 08:07.780]  because you don't feel cool enough, maybe?
[08:08.360 --> 08:12.320]  There is nothing more vulnerable than being in a dump position.
[08:12.900 --> 08:14.780]  But it's also safe and protected.
[08:15.000 --> 08:16.080]  You're in your own bathroom.
[08:16.520 --> 08:18.320]  Nobody else in the world is around to bother you.
[08:18.380 --> 08:20.140]  You can shut and lock the doors.
[08:20.140 --> 08:21.640]  Put on your sunglasses.
[08:21.860 --> 08:22.820]  No one will ever see it.
[08:22.940 --> 08:25.940]  If you can get comfortable wearing sunglasses while you're taking a poop,
[08:26.140 --> 08:28.740]  you can easily be comfortable wearing sunglasses in public.
[08:28.860 --> 08:30.280]  I promise you that.
[08:32.060 --> 08:32.820]  I like it.
[08:32.840 --> 08:33.600]  I'm going to try this.
[08:34.500 --> 08:37.940]  Does it matter what type... just any type of sunglass and you're fine?
[08:38.280 --> 08:39.280]  Yeah, any kind of sunglasses, I think.
[08:40.120 --> 08:40.560]  Interesting.
[08:40.780 --> 08:44.540]  Now, was there anything else unique about that experience that could have amplified it?
[08:44.540 --> 08:46.200]  Or have you tested this multiple times?
[08:46.200 --> 08:47.640]  No, I have been wearing...
[08:47.640 --> 08:49.760]  I have worn my sunglasses a couple times now.
[08:50.420 --> 08:51.500]  Like, I've gone to get them.
[08:52.340 --> 08:55.320]  Which is probably why you need sunglasses in the bathroom.
[08:55.420 --> 08:55.920]  It's a great point.
[08:56.200 --> 08:58.540]  If, like, if they're on the other side of the house and I really got to go,
[08:58.580 --> 09:00.460]  I'm like, it's going to be a shadeless shit.
[09:00.860 --> 09:03.460]  But if I'm, like, thinking about it, yeah, I'll go grab them.
[09:03.520 --> 09:04.820]  Dude, f*** face shit shades.
[09:07.380 --> 09:08.080]  We need them.
[09:08.500 --> 09:09.980]  Hey, even Fonzie poops.
[09:10.540 --> 09:11.540]  That should be our logo.
[09:11.940 --> 09:13.780]  That should be our, like, our catchphrase.
[09:14.080 --> 09:14.360]  Yeah.
[09:14.540 --> 09:14.980]  Shit shades.
[09:15.520 --> 09:16.420]  Even Fonzie poops.
[09:16.620 --> 09:17.820]  Because there's nothing cooler than the Fonz.
[09:17.820 --> 09:20.320]  You don't think that that might be a little bit old of a reference?
[09:20.780 --> 09:21.380]  Or do you think that that's...
[09:21.960 --> 09:26.380]  Do you think that TV show from the 70s might be too old of a reference?
[09:26.660 --> 09:27.860]  I mean, he's still alive, isn't he?
[09:28.200 --> 09:29.720]  Yeah, I love him.
[09:29.780 --> 09:30.320]  Yeah, he's great.
[09:30.380 --> 09:30.860]  He seems great.
[09:31.060 --> 09:31.840]  He's super nice.
[09:32.000 --> 09:38.140]  Even the local theater teacher from Barry poops doesn't have the same ring to it.
[09:38.800 --> 09:39.560]  No, it doesn't.
[09:39.600 --> 09:40.820]  But I feel like that would be more known.
[09:40.960 --> 09:46.420]  I just don't know many products coming to market pumped to use the Fonz as a point of reference for
[09:46.420 --> 09:48.440]  what's going to move their glasses.
[09:48.800 --> 09:51.200]  That's fair. I'm definitely on the...
[09:52.340 --> 09:57.420]  I'm definitely on the back nine of my pop culture experience.
[09:58.460 --> 10:02.800]  That's still cool to you. The pinnacle of cool is the Fonz. It was the Fonz.
[10:03.420 --> 10:04.080]  What's cooler than the Fonz?
[10:04.080 --> 10:04.980]  It will remain to be.
[10:05.720 --> 10:06.780]  That's a tough question.
[10:07.340 --> 10:10.140]  I don't think I'm qualified. I'm not even qualified enough to wear sunglasses.
[10:10.300 --> 10:13.700]  I don't think it's my position to declare who's cool.
[10:13.700 --> 10:18.100]  I get that Arthur Fonzarelli is no longer culturally relevant in any way,
[10:18.220 --> 10:21.220]  but it's hard to think you think of that dude with his hair slick back,
[10:21.260 --> 10:24.100]  looking all sexy with his fucking white T-shirt and his leather jacket,
[10:24.380 --> 10:25.240]  riding on a motorcycle.
[10:25.720 --> 10:27.640]  It's hard to think of something cooler than that.
[10:27.920 --> 10:31.600]  That's fair. He could fix the like, kick the jukebox machine, right?
[10:31.660 --> 10:32.620]  It would work. It would fix it.
[10:32.740 --> 10:33.520]  Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[10:33.760 --> 10:34.300]  That is pretty cool.
[10:34.840 --> 10:37.860]  I mean, he jumped. The shark is still timeless. That's another.
[10:38.000 --> 10:39.180]  It wouldn't be possible without it.
[10:39.200 --> 10:41.100]  That's true. He literally jumped the shark.
[10:41.600 --> 10:42.940]  Yeah, he created that trend.
[10:42.940 --> 10:46.200]  I feel like looking back on what's happened in TV since he jumped the shark,
[10:46.680 --> 10:48.160]  jumping a shark is totally plausible.
[10:48.700 --> 10:50.740]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's an excellent point.
[10:51.140 --> 10:51.480]  More grounded.
[10:51.660 --> 10:54.820]  Maybe not outside of a diner, but yeah, definitely.
[10:58.160 --> 10:58.560]  Yeah.
[10:58.700 --> 11:00.640]  Maybe not in the parking lot of a diner, but.
[11:02.720 --> 11:07.720]  Not to veer too far away from shitting, but just to touch back on anal passage for a minute.
[11:07.800 --> 11:09.080]  I meant to share this. I forgot to.
[11:09.340 --> 11:11.860]  This cracked me up so much when I was publishing the site.
[11:11.860 --> 11:12.920]  This is how it framed.
[11:13.080 --> 11:14.680]  And I just think it's such a great photo.
[11:14.880 --> 11:18.300]  The framing, the text, the backdrop, just everything.
[11:18.440 --> 11:19.920]  I just think that that's so funny.
[11:20.520 --> 11:22.180]  I meant to share that last time.
[11:22.420 --> 11:25.060]  Is that the way it's Shakespeare's face?
[11:25.260 --> 11:26.620]  And it's just as perfect.
[11:28.140 --> 11:32.600]  God, I feel like we should print that on postcards and give them out.
[11:33.640 --> 11:34.400]  That's great.
[11:34.580 --> 11:38.640]  It should be like a freebie that can be like business cards.
[11:38.860 --> 11:40.980]  Yeah, it's just so good.
[11:41.520 --> 11:42.420]  It is great.
[11:42.480 --> 11:45.180]  I just I was like, wow, this is beautiful what you've done here.
[11:45.540 --> 11:48.000]  Fucking wait for Jack to see these comments.
[11:48.280 --> 11:51.680]  I love the idea of all of our business cards being
[11:52.140 --> 11:55.680]  someone who's not on the podcast's face, but who we know.
[11:56.780 --> 11:58.060]  That's a great idea.
[11:58.380 --> 12:00.540]  Because you brought up Geoff, I don't know if this was on the show,
[12:00.600 --> 12:04.000]  wanting to do business cards because people would be like, oh, what are you doing?
[12:04.180 --> 12:06.360]  Like they recognize you and they're like, what have you been up to?
[12:06.440 --> 12:08.860]  And it would be easy for you to just give them a face card.
[12:08.860 --> 12:11.700]  I like the idea of giving them seeing the reaction to somebody
[12:11.700 --> 12:15.400]  that doesn't know what Face is to receiving that card with no other info.
[12:15.920 --> 12:16.520]  That's excellent.
[12:16.700 --> 12:17.540]  So here's what we do.
[12:17.640 --> 12:18.160]  Because you're right.
[12:18.380 --> 12:19.920]  It wasn't on it wasn't in the episode.
[12:20.020 --> 12:20.640]  It was during Slack.
[12:20.720 --> 12:26.180]  But I had the idea the other day because I run into like I run into people all the time
[12:26.180 --> 12:29.860]  that are familiar with like Red vs. Blue or old productions we used to do.
[12:30.140 --> 12:31.440]  And then I was like, oh, what are you up to lately?
[12:31.440 --> 12:35.360]  And I got to go like, well, I do a podcast called Face with my friends.
[12:35.360 --> 12:39.780]  And we talk about baseball cards and, you know, apples.
[12:41.200 --> 12:44.160]  And it's just it's like a it's like a plotting conversation to have.
[12:44.340 --> 12:47.040]  So I was thinking if I had some sort of a face card,
[12:47.080 --> 12:49.100]  I could give people just like a QR code on it.
[12:49.120 --> 12:51.340]  That's like, here, just scan this and listen to this.
[12:51.500 --> 12:55.740]  And, you know, and I actually think Nick had the idea to put the QR code on it.
[12:55.820 --> 12:56.940]  I was just going to put a URL.
[12:57.060 --> 12:59.140]  He's he brought it into the current day.
[12:59.700 --> 13:01.280]  I'm still living in Fonzarelli world.
[13:02.300 --> 13:04.400]  But if it just or maybe it was Eric, whatever.
[13:04.440 --> 13:05.180]  I'm giving Nick the credit.
[13:05.180 --> 13:09.180]  Uh, if it was that on one side and the QR code on the other,
[13:09.260 --> 13:10.720]  and we could just hand that out, I think that'd be amazing.
[13:11.040 --> 13:13.500]  It's like a challenge coins for podcasts with no money.
[13:13.820 --> 13:14.980]  Yeah, there you go.
[13:16.180 --> 13:17.360]  I love that idea.
[13:17.440 --> 13:21.600]  I feel like whenever I meet someone who knows Face, it's so easy to talk to them.
[13:21.820 --> 13:23.260]  It's like an immediate icebreaker.
[13:23.340 --> 13:26.740]  Whereas like sometimes people come up as, you know,
[13:26.740 --> 13:28.320]  the fan of Achievement Hunter or something, but it's
[13:28.800 --> 13:32.380]  the content is overwhelming and there's you don't really know where to start with the conversation.
[13:32.520 --> 13:32.680]  Yeah.
[13:32.680 --> 13:36.580]  So you kind of just have to make small talk almost with Face.
[13:36.660 --> 13:39.920]  Whenever people come up about Face, they immediately just go into like,
[13:39.980 --> 13:41.100]  oh, can you believe Andrew did?
[13:41.540 --> 13:45.920]  Yeah, well, we have our own language together.
[13:46.080 --> 13:49.880]  And I think that you can tell when somebody speaks Face,
[13:49.940 --> 13:51.760]  you've got a friend in life there.
[13:51.860 --> 13:52.260]  You know what I mean?
[13:52.820 --> 13:55.460]  It is. It's a warm, comfortable feeling for sure.
[13:57.320 --> 13:59.100]  I have another bathroom thing.
[13:59.340 --> 14:01.800]  This isn't a life hack, but it's a potential.
[14:01.800 --> 14:03.500]  Oh, real quick. I'm just going to go down the line.
[14:04.060 --> 14:06.440]  Nick, are you wearing the monkey mask right now?
[14:06.700 --> 14:07.580]  No, not right now.
[14:07.820 --> 14:10.560]  Okay. Emily asked me if you wear it when you record Face.
[14:10.620 --> 14:14.660]  I thought, I don't think so, but I figured that she imagined you always wearing it.
[14:14.720 --> 14:15.400]  And so I thought I'd ask.
[14:15.700 --> 14:17.140]  I mean, he's not nearly muffled enough.
[14:17.400 --> 14:19.240]  Yeah, I thought too.
[14:21.160 --> 14:24.160]  That's like the masked singer, but he's just producing quietly.
[14:24.440 --> 14:27.020]  Should we give you a challenge where in the next 20 episodes,
[14:27.020 --> 14:30.100]  you have to wear it at least once and we have to figure out which one it is.
[14:30.240 --> 14:31.080]  Oh, that's great.
[14:31.120 --> 14:31.700]  Yeah, let's do it.
[14:31.800 --> 14:36.480]  That is a great. Yeah. So between 1.32 and 1.42, you have to wear it.
[14:36.540 --> 14:36.760]  Okay.
[14:37.820 --> 14:39.380]  Oh, I'm sorry. 1.52. That'd be 20 episodes.
[14:40.600 --> 14:41.740]  Let's just say by 1.50.
[14:41.980 --> 14:46.100]  1.50. Okay. That's great. Yeah. It'd be like our, we'll find out if we, yeah, there we go.
[14:46.660 --> 14:47.660]  We'll never remember that.
[14:47.960 --> 14:51.520]  No, there's no way. So here's my other bathroom.
[14:51.880 --> 14:53.080]  We just don't talk to him there.
[14:54.140 --> 14:56.320]  Well, then we didn't. Then he got it. Then he beat us.
[14:56.440 --> 14:57.380]  He snuck it by.
[14:57.500 --> 14:58.120]  Then he wins. Yeah.
[14:58.680 --> 15:03.840]  Uh, so this is not a life hack, but this is a experiment. I think that we could try.
[15:04.580 --> 15:12.160]  Uh, I last night cooked spaghetti and, uh, asparagus for dinner.
[15:13.080 --> 15:14.640]  And I went to the grocery store.
[15:14.800 --> 15:17.960]  I went to the grocery store to get asparagus because I fucking, I'm the biggest, I'm the
[15:17.960 --> 15:22.480]  big asparagus fan, right? And all they had, they didn't have any asparagus out. And I was like,
[15:22.480 --> 15:27.480]  is it not asparagus season? You get so used to in America, things being there 365 days a year.
[15:27.480 --> 15:35.100]  And the only asparagus they had was like in a little bag against the wall in the lake away
[15:35.100 --> 15:40.240]  from where the, like where the, like the mint and shit is. Right. And, uh, but it was organic
[15:40.240 --> 15:45.400]  and it was pretty expensive, but, but it was like, I had a craving for asparagus and I thought,
[15:45.520 --> 15:49.440]  well, fuck it. I'll just buy this asparagus. Uh, and I'm sure it'll be fine. It's organic.
[15:49.540 --> 15:53.440]  It's expensive. It's probably tastes delicious. And it was, it was fucking phenomenal. I roasted
[15:53.440 --> 15:58.780]  it in, uh, uh, in the air fryer and it was some of the best asparagus I've ever had. However,
[15:59.480 --> 16:04.980]  here's where I'm going with this. People always talk about how asparagus makes your pee smell bad,
[16:05.020 --> 16:11.080]  right? Yeah. I've noticed it a little bit in the past and I am a guy who's eaten a shit ton of
[16:11.080 --> 16:15.080]  asparagus. I, anytime I grill, I grill Brussels spouts and asparagus cause I love them both.
[16:15.640 --> 16:20.340]  I've noticed it a little bit in the past, but never like what people describe. However,
[16:20.340 --> 16:27.560]  uh, last night, two hours after I ate that asparagus, I took a piss that almost knocked
[16:27.560 --> 16:35.540]  me out from the start. I gagged from the asparagus smell. It was overwhelming. Like it was making my
[16:35.540 --> 16:43.120]  eyes closed. It was so bad. And that got me thinking, why is like, why now? Right? And the
[16:43.120 --> 16:49.980]  only thing I can think of is it's organic special asparagus. So is there a, a smell difference in
[16:49.980 --> 16:56.600]  your urine from like bog standard, normal asparagus or organic asparagus? Yeah. I've been
[16:56.600 --> 17:01.820]  trying to like breed the fumes out of it. Right. Have that. Yeah. Or like do the pesticides kill
[17:01.820 --> 17:06.020]  the fumes or are they breeding the fumes out or what? But it got me thinking like, is this an
[17:06.020 --> 17:10.680]  anomaly? Was it like combined with something else I ate? So I think we should do asparagus piss
[17:10.680 --> 17:16.160]  tests where we eat like regular asparagus on one day and then pee and, and, and, you know,
[17:16.160 --> 17:22.860]  record the volume of smell and then eat organic asparagus the next day and then see if, uh, if
[17:22.860 --> 17:28.240]  it's noticeably different. And then if so, if we can narrow it down to like the kind of asparagus
[17:28.240 --> 17:33.920]  that makes your piss smell the worst. I'm very sensitive to it. I, it takes me by surprise every
[17:33.920 --> 17:39.660]  single time, but I always, it is always very strong. 47 years. I never smelled anything like
[17:39.660 --> 17:44.500]  this. I've even had it where I'll smell it and be like, oh, I guess there was some asparagus in
[17:44.500 --> 17:49.820]  what I ate. Like even the tiniest hint of it that I didn't even notice. Really? So I wonder, like,
[17:49.880 --> 17:54.800]  maybe you're feeling that after, after regular asparagus. If, if I'm right, and it wasn't just
[17:54.800 --> 17:59.180]  like an anomaly, if this asparagus is that much stronger, I wonder if I could knock you out with
[17:59.180 --> 18:05.680]  your bone piss. Because this shit was strong. I don't feel like I've ever noticed it either.
[18:06.760 --> 18:10.100]  Yeah. Or maybe like the air fryer does something different to it than grilling it. That could be.
[18:10.200 --> 18:13.780]  I don't know. Yeah. But I do feel like further exploration is warranted.
[18:14.560 --> 18:19.120]  I agree. When you were making your asparagus piss or whatever, when you were pissing with,
[18:19.280 --> 18:24.060]  whatever, were you wearing sunglasses? This is also another important research point.
[18:24.540 --> 18:30.780]  No, no, I don't wear sunglasses when I cook. Uh, only when I go out, only when I ride my bike or
[18:30.780 --> 18:35.160]  walk or drive or shit. No, but, but, but in the act of pissing, have you worn them?
[18:35.380 --> 18:41.020]  Oh, uh, yeah, certainly. Certainly. I've worn them.
[18:43.120 --> 18:48.980]  I like that idea too. You should try that. Yeah, maybe. I think at the point of you're saying
[18:48.980 --> 18:53.100]  shitting with them on is a different experience. I think you just have to try every experience
[18:53.100 --> 18:58.220]  that you typically have with them on to see if it is constantly positive. If they're in some
[18:58.220 --> 19:02.340]  negatives, I think there's more research we could do. Yeah. After this conversation. Yeah,
[19:02.380 --> 19:07.460]  I think that's, that's an interesting point. Um, I think it's more of just like doing it,
[19:08.020 --> 19:12.720]  doing it in when you shouldn't, or when you wouldn't normally think to wear something like,
[19:12.900 --> 19:18.780]  cause it caught me by surprise. Right. Um, yeah, because like anytime I go outside, I'm wearing
[19:18.780 --> 19:23.240]  sunglasses. So like it's the same sunglasses I was wearing when I was hitting the baseballs
[19:23.240 --> 19:29.140]  the other day. Okay. Yeah. Um, I bet I could smell other people's asparagus.
[19:31.120 --> 19:35.080]  I bet you could too. That's what I always worry about. If I'm in a public,
[19:35.080 --> 19:39.040]  what are you talking about? No, I'm just saying I've only ever smelled like you're
[19:40.060 --> 19:44.840]  go ahead. Well, I've only ever smelled my own, but I've always worried if I have to,
[19:44.960 --> 19:50.440]  if I have like asparagus on a plane and then I unload it in a public toilet in like some urinals,
[19:50.720 --> 19:54.560]  I'm always worried. Can the, can the people next to me smell my asparagus?
[19:55.140 --> 19:59.720]  The way you phrased that Gavin was like, you're a fucking bomb sniffing dog. Like I bet I'd be
[19:59.720 --> 20:05.460]  able to detect. I can tell you what brand they had. Like what? That's what was so alarming by
[20:05.460 --> 20:12.960]  what you said. So you're worried about leaving evidence of your asparagus pee in public places
[20:12.960 --> 20:17.940]  is what you're saying. Yeah. I don't know whether it's like a, are you, are you not worried about
[20:17.940 --> 20:24.780]  your piss smelling otherwise or yeah. Piss just generally doesn't smell great. Well, if you're
[20:25.240 --> 20:31.400]  a normal like hydrated, like a pretty clear regular piss doesn't really smell that much.
[20:31.740 --> 20:35.020]  Yeah. And also if it smells of anything, it smells like the piss you smell every day.
[20:35.160 --> 20:39.560]  It doesn't smell like, Oh, that's different. No, that's my point though. Even an optimal piss
[20:39.560 --> 20:44.380]  doesn't smell good. There's no scenario in which it smells nice. So I don't really know,
[20:44.420 --> 20:48.860]  like I, I don't get why you said five people at a urinal. We're all expecting to smell this
[20:48.860 --> 20:52.700]  the same sort of thing. But if someone's kicking out some asparagus,
[20:53.720 --> 20:57.600]  that's going to register. Do you think we're going to be wondering who's the asparagus guy?
[20:57.900 --> 21:01.680]  No, that's what I'm saying. So if there's five people in a line, do you think you could detect
[21:01.680 --> 21:05.580]  on number two? It was number two. I could tell how long it took for the odor to hit me.
[21:05.840 --> 21:08.980]  That'd be a great way to solve a murder mystery. It's like,
[21:16.100 --> 21:26.440]  Oh, this is cracking me up. Picturing Gavin at an airport row of urinals,
[21:26.780 --> 21:30.820]  but he's dressed like a detective going, hmm, what are these men?
[21:31.400 --> 21:39.800]  What if it was you, Gavin, would you adjust? Let's say you're approaching the urinal.
[21:40.160 --> 21:45.480]  You got a bunch, you just had a whole fucking bucket of asparagus. You're nervous. It's empty
[21:45.480 --> 21:50.220]  when you get in. Four people walk in behind you. Everyone's lined up. You're not taking,
[21:50.340 --> 21:54.000]  you can't get out of it. You're committed to this. Do you, how do you adjust? You just,
[21:54.060 --> 21:57.640]  you bite the bullet on it. What are you doing? Are you trying to pee in spurts?
[21:57.640 --> 22:01.780]  Probably pull my head up. You wouldn't be like, you wouldn't try to deflect and be like, whoa,
[22:02.180 --> 22:06.200]  somebody had asparagus last night. Which one of you crazy kids was it?
[22:09.400 --> 22:14.800]  Do you think if I drink enough coffee and my coffee piss was so overwhelming that it would
[22:14.800 --> 22:20.220]  throw you off the scent of the asparagus? Wait, wait, there's coffee piss? Yeah.
[22:22.360 --> 22:25.300]  Yeah. You don't drink, do you not drink? Are you like not a coffee guy, Gavin?
[22:25.860 --> 22:31.340]  No, I have coffee almost every day. Oh, you should, you should try brewing it way stronger
[22:31.340 --> 22:37.540]  and then see what happens. Or drink more and then pee. Yeah. It is, it, it's, it's like smelling,
[22:38.260 --> 22:44.760]  like it smells like coffee. It's a lot. Okay. Well, someone's clearly, if it's coffee on one
[22:44.760 --> 22:48.680]  side and asparagus on the other side, someone slid my slider all the way to asparagus. Cause I don't,
[22:48.740 --> 22:54.260]  I do not detect coffee. The worst Steeler's Wheel song. I don't, I don't think I've ever
[22:54.260 --> 22:59.280]  taken any notice of piss smelling different with coffee in it. Yeah. I don't drink coffee. So I
[22:59.280 --> 23:03.740]  haven't had that experience either. How many flavors of piss would you say there are? That's
[23:03.740 --> 23:08.620]  a great question. There's regulation piss and there's asparagus. No, he's right. There's also
[23:08.620 --> 23:13.680]  coffee piss. And this is because Andrew doesn't drink coffee. I bet we could have him drink like
[23:13.680 --> 23:19.720]  five cups of like a lot of really strong coffee and then pee. I bet he'd be a great case subject
[23:19.720 --> 23:25.760]  for this. That would be interesting. Do you think, sorry, Gavin, go ahead. What do you think
[23:25.760 --> 23:31.160]  you would overly dehydrated when you had your extreme asparagus piss? That could be a factor.
[23:31.480 --> 23:36.900]  I mean, I wonder if you had, if you had asparagus only for lunch and dinner and didn't drink water
[23:36.900 --> 23:42.000]  all day, what would that piss be like? God, I wonder if we could, like, if there's something
[23:42.000 --> 23:49.140]  to this, that the asparagus I got ahold of is more potent than regular asparagus. I wonder what we
[23:49.140 --> 23:54.360]  could do to manipulate it so that we could come up with the strongest asparagus smell. Like, I bet,
[23:54.420 --> 23:59.880]  I bet if I didn't drink water for like 24 hours and then I ate like, God, 10 pounds of asparagus.
[24:00.840 --> 24:06.340]  Now, here's the thing. What if you juiced asparagus and that's how you got a bunch of
[24:06.340 --> 24:13.080]  your liquid in? Oh, no. Liquid asparagus. Yeah, but that'd be gross. Geoff, what about this is
[24:13.080 --> 24:18.320]  not gross? We're talking about trying to figure out to make the smelliest piss. I don't know why
[24:18.320 --> 24:22.080]  we've been trying to get Columbo involved in the investigation when we've got piss boy right here.
[24:25.340 --> 24:31.160]  Andrew's like, it's just like, I know this. No, no, no. We've already covered this. Your
[24:31.160 --> 24:36.060]  nephew is piss boy now. He's taking the piss on half a plane. Columbo had like regular weekly
[24:36.060 --> 24:41.660]  episodes. And then as time got on and he got older, he started doing like a few a year down
[24:41.660 --> 24:45.020]  to the point where he would just come out maybe once a year, they'd wheel out Columbo. Piss boy
[24:45.020 --> 24:50.280]  can wheel out retirement once a year for an investigation. Piss boy is like Dr. Who. It's
[24:50.280 --> 24:55.500]  a new doctor now. It's the new piss boy is the head of the franchise. He regenerated? Yeah,
[24:56.080 --> 25:02.060]  he's back. He's a piss lord. And he's your nephew. Piss lord. Your nephew's the new piss lord.
[25:09.200 --> 25:15.700]  Well, that so we have coffee. We have asparagus. Is there anything out there that makes pea smell
[25:15.700 --> 25:20.920]  good? Like, you know, like pineapples supposed to make semen taste good. Like, is there anything
[25:20.920 --> 25:25.120]  that makes pea smell good? It's a passion fruit. That's got to be something, right?
[25:25.220 --> 25:29.300]  There's got to be something out there you could eat that could make like, like floral piss.
[25:31.260 --> 25:35.960]  Well, maybe I mean, there's that there's that thing you can eat that makes lemons not sour,
[25:36.040 --> 25:40.320]  right? Oh, yeah. Got to be one for smell. There's gotta be something like that for smell.
[25:40.580 --> 25:44.240]  Interesting. A little miracle thing. All right. Well, I don't know where we're where we're going
[25:44.240 --> 25:49.640]  from here. But I feel like experiments need to begin. Yeah, probably needs to start with me.
[25:49.740 --> 25:54.540]  I need to go get some more asparagus and determine if this was just a one off or if this is like a
[25:54.980 --> 25:59.580]  replicatable event. I'm gonna try having maybe like three double espressos in the same day and
[25:59.580 --> 26:03.540]  see what happens. Yeah, let's see if we can get Andrew and Gavin to smell their own coffee pea.
[26:04.060 --> 26:09.000]  I'll try it. A lot of pine. I'm doing some research. Things that can make your pea smell.
[26:09.480 --> 26:16.840]  Fish, coffee, garlic, human, but pineapple is on the list. But it just says you have to eat a lot
[26:16.840 --> 26:22.060]  of it. Okay. And it smells good. Well, I mean, I think it smells like pot like kind of like
[26:22.060 --> 26:26.160]  pineapple. I mean, like when you have a coffee, piss, it smells like coffee. Like it does. It
[26:26.160 --> 26:31.940]  doesn't smell like how like asparagus smells bad. It smells like coffee. So, huh. Why would
[26:31.940 --> 26:36.400]  it have? It's clearly not as strong as the asparagus then. So my question, Gavin, for you
[26:36.400 --> 26:42.520]  is what's worse? What's more alarming to be at a urinal and to have a strong odor of the asparagus
[26:42.520 --> 26:49.680]  piss? Or if somebody ate a whole bunch of pineapple and somebody said smells good while the pissing was
[26:49.680 --> 26:55.540]  happening, what's worse? I'd personally rather have the asparagus piss than the good smelling
[26:55.540 --> 27:00.760]  piss that somebody calls out. Hmm. I think I'd appreciate the good smelling piss. Really? That
[27:00.760 --> 27:04.840]  seems so much more comfortable to me. I would think what's going on if it suddenly started
[27:04.840 --> 27:13.460]  smelling good. I would be alarmed. What is happening? Uh, there was a question and this
[27:13.460 --> 27:18.500]  is from like a while ago that Geoff asked me that he said he wasn't going to remember. There's like
[27:18.500 --> 27:22.740]  two weeks ago after we... Oh, it's on my list. Yeah. Is it? Okay, cool. Yeah. Yeah, you should
[27:22.740 --> 27:28.600]  ask that. Okay. Yeah, I think I'm done with bathroom stuff now. I don't have a lot of
[27:29.060 --> 27:34.900]  lists left. Okay, here we go. Emily asked this question to me the other day and I thought it
[27:34.900 --> 27:39.420]  was a really interesting question. I'd love to hear y'all's take on it. I know Eric's.
[27:39.880 --> 27:44.200]  Would you, if we had to do it again, if they were both in front of you and you had to eat one
[27:44.200 --> 27:51.340]  helping of them, would you rather eat a slice of the plowman's pizza again or a bowl of the
[27:51.340 --> 27:58.420]  beanhole beans? Beanhole beans. Really? Nick, how about you? The beanhole beans for sure. I'm going
[27:58.420 --> 28:02.400]  to say he wasn't in the mask. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, definitely didn't seem to be in the mask.
[28:03.600 --> 28:08.240]  Uh, okay. This is interesting. I don't know. I mean, the plowman's pizza was pretty
[28:08.240 --> 28:13.000]  fucking gross, but I still kind of have nightmares about those beans. They weren't bad though.
[28:13.000 --> 28:17.300]  Really? Yeah, they were pretty gross. They looked like... all I can think of when I think about
[28:17.300 --> 28:24.000]  those beans is the food in the, like in Resident Evil 7. It's on like the, you know, like the
[28:24.000 --> 28:28.000]  buckets of food with like flies on it and shit. That's what I think of when I think of those beans.
[28:28.900 --> 28:34.220]  Now, do you think expectation has to do with that evaluation for you? Because you were so excited
[28:34.220 --> 28:38.900]  about the beanhole beans, where I feel like, and I wasn't present for the experience, but I assume
[28:38.900 --> 28:44.280]  that it was pretty clear what the plowman's pizza was going to be at every stage of making it.
[28:44.640 --> 28:47.800]  Well, the plowman's pizza could have been better. Well, obviously. I don't think it
[28:47.800 --> 28:52.700]  could have been worse from what I heard. The middle was raw and the side was burnt.
[28:53.100 --> 28:57.380]  Yeah, my point is, is that there was hope for the beans until you opened them. With the pizza,
[28:57.860 --> 29:00.460]  knowing what was on it and seeing it being made. There was hope for my pizza.
[29:00.520 --> 29:04.740]  I don't... how do you feel? Do you feel... was there hope, Geoff? Were you optimistic at any point?
[29:06.240 --> 29:12.260]  No, I wasn't optimistic at any point for anything that any of our food that day. But I will say,
[29:12.880 --> 29:18.480]  after the experience, I am optimistic that he could modify that recipe to be something
[29:18.480 --> 29:24.720]  super edible. And I think the crust is all right. Yeah, yeah. I also think, like, if we,
[29:24.880 --> 29:30.260]  like, we were using pre-cooked, like, half-cooked crust, so it cooked faster than the ingredients
[29:30.260 --> 29:35.580]  on top. And then we didn't understand, you know, I only watched one YouTube video and nobody else
[29:35.580 --> 29:40.340]  watched any. So we were going off of one YouTube video for the... in terms of placement and heat
[29:40.340 --> 29:44.400]  and stuff. So there's definitely so much room for improvement. I think a properly cooked plowman's
[29:44.400 --> 29:48.040]  pizza would have been a lot less gross. I think if I started with dough, it would have been
[29:48.040 --> 29:54.400]  a lot better. Yeah. Is that out yet? I don't know. The pizza at this point? Yeah, by the time this
[29:54.400 --> 30:00.120]  one comes out, is that out? Do you think? This will be out in, what, two weeks? It's cutting it
[30:00.120 --> 30:05.780]  close. We can try. We can definitely try. We'll see. We'll see. Should have it done by next week.
[30:05.840 --> 30:12.200]  So you know what? Yes, it's out. Sick. Yeah, why not? Until you do get mad? I don't know.
[30:12.340 --> 30:19.620]  Well, my bit's done. I forgot to put this in my notes. You reminded me, Geoff. Since we've done
[30:19.620 --> 30:24.620]  the pizza cook and I had that other, you know, like the, the flat top mini grill, essentially,
[30:25.160 --> 30:29.260]  I've been expanding my cooking, my desk cooking. I've been trying to figure out like what other
[30:29.260 --> 30:34.440]  dishes I could make on that beyond what we currently know. So far, nothing has beaten
[30:34.440 --> 30:39.380]  the waffle, but I have like a list of recipes I've been trying to make. I did cookies. That didn't
[30:39.380 --> 30:43.800]  turn out all that great. They just, it wouldn't, it didn't solidify hard enough. Then it would burn,
[30:43.880 --> 30:49.340]  be able to flip it. I was just going to post. I tried to make a grilled cheese and I encountered
[30:49.340 --> 30:55.860]  problems with it immediately. It didn't quite fit. It's a little, the bread, the bread was a little
[30:55.860 --> 31:04.280]  too big, unfortunately. Once again, the state of that table is just an absolute disgrace.
[31:04.400 --> 31:10.080]  It's a cooking station. So it gets messy when we're putting things together. I realized though
[31:10.080 --> 31:14.800]  that it doesn't need to work by itself. I joined the machines. It was a working,
[31:14.800 --> 31:20.680]  they collaborated. They worked together so we could get a good cook across both sides.
[31:25.220 --> 31:31.400]  Nick says you can keep that XLR cable. Is that a bottle of Windex up there? What is that?
[31:31.680 --> 31:38.060]  Yeah. You got a Windex. You got the bingo machine. A bottle of a barks root beer with some water in
[31:38.060 --> 31:45.760]  it. I was drinking some water out of a bottle. I don't know what the investigation. I hate to
[31:45.760 --> 31:50.100]  shine a UV light on that surface. I'm sure it looks great. You know, it's interesting that you
[31:50.100 --> 31:53.800]  went side to side and not head to head. I thought about it, but look, hey, that turned out pretty
[31:53.800 --> 32:01.120]  good. Yeah. And even cook. I can't even cook shit. Yeah. It turns out great. We'll keep you guys
[32:01.120 --> 32:07.660]  updated. Honestly, it could, it could use a little bit more, uh, the, the, the flipping and whatnot
[32:07.660 --> 32:12.160]  organizing it. Cheese need more cheese, but I think it could be great. I think I gave it like
[32:12.160 --> 32:16.540]  a 7.82. Here's what I think. What I, here's what I think about this. I think this is a recipe for
[32:16.540 --> 32:21.220]  our cookbook that it definitely exists at this point that we'll, cause we've made at this point,
[32:21.240 --> 32:25.760]  probably close to a dozen recipes we could put into a cookbook. If we add it all up and include
[32:25.760 --> 32:32.540]  the beans and the fucking, uh, 10 million other things we've cooked. Uh, so like the double waffle
[32:32.540 --> 32:39.260]  maker, uh, cheese, grilled cheese, I think should be an entry. So please don't forget about that.
[32:39.520 --> 32:43.620]  Salads. That's true. Sauces. I won't, I'll keep adding to it. I want to try some fruit on there.
[32:43.720 --> 32:48.340]  I put some Turkey on the other night for it. That was okay. It heated it. Well, give it a little
[32:48.340 --> 32:53.260]  bit of a nice sear. I think there's room. So I'm excited. I'll keep you guys updated on the
[32:53.260 --> 32:57.500]  current top desk food by far as waffles. I'd be shocked if anything passes.
[32:58.260 --> 33:04.680]  I have, uh, I have four more things. Uh, some of them are really tiny.
[33:05.100 --> 33:11.240]  I have a life hack written down. Oh, do it. Oh, but it's so specific to me,
[33:12.040 --> 33:16.060]  but I feel like maybe it's useful for someone else. It just says, learn the names of every
[33:16.060 --> 33:22.220]  classical music piece you hear. Because the amount of times I want to, the amount of times I want to
[33:22.220 --> 33:26.360]  a piece of classical music as like parody or something in a video,
[33:26.640 --> 33:31.880]  I don't fricking know the name of anything. I ended up on the same playlist of classical music,
[33:32.100 --> 33:35.660]  skipping one by one, be like, not that one, not that one, not that one. And I feel like if I just
[33:35.660 --> 33:40.600]  spent the time early on in life to sit down, cause it's too, too, it's too late for me now. I'm not
[33:40.600 --> 33:46.480]  going to take that. But earlier on, I should have sat down and memorized the top 20 classical tracks.
[33:46.700 --> 33:50.940]  And I think that would have helped me waste way less time in my later life. That's my life hack.
[33:50.940 --> 33:55.300]  I don't think that's a hack. Knowledge. But that's a good piece of advice. Knowledge is your hack.
[33:55.740 --> 34:01.200]  The fact that you came at me with my, with my happy meal hack, you were like, that's not a
[34:01.200 --> 34:05.940]  hack. That's ridiculous. And you just fricking, let me tell you my new hack guys, learn information.
[34:06.220 --> 34:12.080]  That's a great hack. Thanks Gavin. Most hacks are information. It's true. Wouldn't you say?
[34:12.240 --> 34:16.020]  But you're not manipulating. You're just learning. You're just, you're, you're, you're containing info.
[34:16.480 --> 34:21.080]  It's not like, what if, all right, what if he, what if he, I understand what you're saying, Andrew.
[34:21.340 --> 34:27.940]  What if, what if the life hack is learn the names of the classical songs that I hear
[34:27.940 --> 34:33.700]  with sunglasses on? Now, if there is a method, maybe I think you can make an argument that that's
[34:33.700 --> 34:39.360]  more of a hack. But if I'm just, I'm mainly coming at him because he came at my hack and I would say
[34:39.360 --> 34:43.460]  his is less of a hack than mine was. Nick Cripe also going to be great for casual conversation
[34:43.460 --> 34:50.300]  with high class folks. Yeah. I think it is a hack if you get ahead of it and you start early.
[34:53.420 --> 34:59.360]  So all advice is a hack. All wisdom, all experience is a hack is what you're saying.
[35:00.280 --> 35:06.680]  Well, I think it's a hack if you're getting ahead of a problem. Yeah. Even if you don't have the
[35:06.680 --> 35:15.140]  problem yet. Yeah. It's he, that's a point he's trying. No, it's not. It's not. It's not a hack.
[35:15.260 --> 35:21.680]  If I'm constantly up against the same problem and then I, I sit down and do something about it.
[35:21.680 --> 35:26.940]  Isn't that a little life hack? Okay. Let me, let me put it to you this way. If I didn't know how
[35:26.940 --> 35:31.880]  to spell a word and then I learned how to spell it, I would go fucking hacked it. I hacked it.
[35:37.740 --> 35:41.300]  It's a pretty good point you just brought up. It's a ridiculous hack.
[35:42.060 --> 35:45.760]  All right. I'm going to change the title of my note, my list of life hacks.
[35:47.280 --> 35:50.880]  That doesn't bode well because I've got a list on my phone called life hacks. And that's the
[35:50.880 --> 35:56.220]  only thing on it. So I'm going to have to. Listen, I've been there. It sucks to learn
[35:56.220 --> 36:00.080]  your hack isn't a hack. You'll, you'll get through it. You'll make it through. You'll be okay. That'll
[36:00.080 --> 36:04.880]  be filled with stuff. I will say I even approached the, the sunglasses on the toilet things by saying,
[36:04.880 --> 36:09.860]  I'm not sure this is a hack. It's just what I wrote. I'm still on the fence about it. The
[36:09.860 --> 36:15.940]  mind might not even qualify as a life hack. Honestly. I, I think yours is more valid.
[36:16.620 --> 36:26.600]  Just no information. Let's talk about the gift that keeps on giving. Hello,
[36:26.700 --> 36:32.040]  tushy bidet. It cleans your butt way better than wiping, cuts your toilet paper use down by 80%,
[36:32.960 --> 36:37.400]  saves trees and all the thousands of gallons of water used to convert them into toilet paper.
[36:37.400 --> 36:43.800]  And it comes with a book full of poop jokes. My butt is in love. Hello, tushy bidet is a fantastic

[41:01.120 --> 41:06.960]  that I want to put in both of your mouths. What? Yeah, I put something, I put something in my mouth
[41:06.960 --> 41:11.240]  the other day and I want to put it in your mouth, Andrew, and I want to put it in your mouth, Gavin.
[41:11.320 --> 41:18.760]  I put it in Eric's mouth yesterday. Interesting. So I'm curious, is it something to do with how
[41:18.760 --> 41:23.560]  you put it in or is it just like a flavor you want us to experiment with? No, it's just candy. Okay.
[41:24.040 --> 41:34.100]  I, uh, I, I stumbled upon accidentally the least edible candy on earth. I am a fan and I recognize
[41:34.100 --> 41:42.140]  that it is a polarizing, a polarizing flavor out of the gate. And statistically, probably 70% of you
[41:42.140 --> 41:46.860]  that I'm talking to on this podcast are gonna, are gonna have a negative reaction to me even
[41:46.860 --> 41:54.180]  mentioning it. But I am a huge, huge fan of black licorice. I eat it. I love it. I eat it constantly.
[41:54.360 --> 41:57.640]  I can't get enough black licorice. That's the stuff that kills you if you eat it constantly, right?
[41:57.640 --> 42:03.840]  Yeah. It's the stuff that kills you. Yeah. It, uh, it makes your ankles hurt. And, uh, yeah. Um,
[42:04.600 --> 42:09.380]  so I eat black licorice whenever I get the chance. I was at world market the other day with Emily,
[42:09.700 --> 42:14.320]  Christmas shopping, of course. And, uh, I saw they have like a candy section and I was looking
[42:14.320 --> 42:20.100]  through their like fancy candies and they had this stuff called Gustaf's Dutch licorice. I was in,
[42:21.760 --> 42:26.900]  in classic salt licorice, it said. And I thought, what is salt licorice? That's interesting. I love
[42:26.900 --> 42:33.240]  salt. I love licorice. And they had a bag called double salt. So I bought double salt. Yeah,
[42:33.300 --> 42:38.980]  that's it right there. Uh, Eric's got a picture of it. Uh, and I got so excited when I got home,
[42:39.080 --> 42:42.460]  I ripped into it. And then Emily's family was there and they were like, Oh, you're like,
[42:42.520 --> 42:45.220]  her sister was like, you're gonna, you like licorice? And I'm like, Oh, I love it. I can't
[42:45.220 --> 42:48.280]  get enough of this stuff. It's like, ah, it's too much for me. And I'm like, no, I can't get enough
[42:48.280 --> 42:52.920]  of it. I put one in my mouth as if to prove her wrong. And I almost spit it across the room.
[42:52.920 --> 42:58.340]  I had such a, and I pretended to like it. I'm like, delicious. And then I had to wait
[42:58.340 --> 43:03.160]  till she looked away. And I ran and threw it in the trash can. I have never had something try to,
[43:03.420 --> 43:10.000]  like, I've never had my mouth try to remove something from itself. So immediately and
[43:10.000 --> 43:17.480]  violently. And I love salt and I love licorice, but this is something unreal. Was it just the
[43:17.480 --> 43:21.660]  salt that came through too hard? It's so intense. Eric, what will, I don't know how to describe it.
[43:21.660 --> 43:28.480]  Oh, I do. Uh, have you guys ever been to the ocean? I have. Have you ever been in the water
[43:28.480 --> 43:33.340]  and then you get slammed by a wave and you just get a mouthful of ocean water? Yeah, I have. Now
[43:33.340 --> 43:39.200]  imagine that it's a bite-sized coin and you put it in your mouth and you're magically transported
[43:39.200 --> 43:45.780]  there. And that is Gustav's Dutch licorice, double salt, classic salt licorice. It, it is like
[43:45.780 --> 43:51.440]  eating the ocean. It is miserable. I think this is harder to eat than a hundred percent dark
[43:51.440 --> 43:56.420]  chocolate. Oh, a hundred. Absolutely. Absolutely agree. A hundred percent agree. No, no, no question.
[43:56.720 --> 44:01.280]  No question. I have, I have yet to succeed. I've tried four or five times now because I keep
[44:01.280 --> 44:05.160]  thinking, ah, it's probably better today. Uh, I was just in a bad mood yesterday. I could get
[44:05.160 --> 44:11.800]  through it. I've not gotten through one piece of candy yet. It's, it's immediate how you revolt
[44:11.800 --> 44:16.460]  from it and take it out of your mouth. Yeah. It's wild. Is there anything,
[44:16.780 --> 44:19.960]  is there like training licorice, like the chocolate has the different levels of,
[44:20.220 --> 44:25.600]  is there like salt on a half and then like salt in two thirds? I don't know. We can look before
[44:25.600 --> 44:29.580]  you get to double salt. We can look into that, but I want to do some sort of a contest when we
[44:29.580 --> 44:34.180]  all get together, uh, or sometime on the podcast where we see who can just keep a piece in their
[44:34.180 --> 44:38.680]  mouth long, the longest. Okay. Whether it's you finish it or not, just like, can you keep it in
[44:38.680 --> 44:43.600]  your mouth for a minute? Oh, fascinating. Wow. That's 150 grams. According to the NHS website,
[44:43.720 --> 44:49.680]  eating more than 57 grams above the age of 40 of black licorice every day for at least two weeks
[44:49.680 --> 44:54.800]  could lead to potentially serious health problems such as irregular heart rhythm.
[44:55.440 --> 45:00.820]  What did it say about, uh, piss smell? It doesn't mention piss. Well, luckily for me,
[45:00.820 --> 45:06.380]  I can't get through one piece of this candy, so I'm safe. Oh, it says under the, and underneath,
[45:06.380 --> 45:09.900]  no matter how old you are, you should avoid eating large amounts of black licorice over a
[45:09.900 --> 45:16.540]  short space of time. Oh, stop. Huh? It's like, well, I mean, if it helps, it's physically impossible
[45:16.540 --> 45:22.660]  to eat this kind of black licorice. Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited to try it. Can I try some tomorrow?
[45:23.680 --> 45:27.020]  Uh, yeah, I'll bring it in tomorrow. That's a good idea. Bring it tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[45:27.340 --> 45:32.200]  We could maybe walk around the office and annoy people with it. Yeah, that'd be fun. Oh, maybe
[45:32.200 --> 45:37.820]  we could watch the pizza video tomorrow. Oh, dude, that'd be great. Instead of individually
[45:37.820 --> 45:41.700]  watching it on Google Drive, we could just watch it on, uh, sausage, well, not, maybe not recorded,
[45:41.800 --> 45:45.640]  but just while we're on office day. You don't want to do a director's commentary of the pizza video?
[45:46.080 --> 45:48.000]  I just think it's, I just don't want three videos.
[45:52.080 --> 45:56.700]  That's a great idea. We should definitely do that. Uh, so can I get this licorice anywhere?
[45:56.820 --> 46:00.840]  Like, can I get this on Amazon? Dude, I don't, I don't know. I'll look into it. I'll try to get
[46:00.840 --> 46:04.400]  you some. I just, I found it at world market. And if not, I'll just go down, I'll drive down
[46:04.400 --> 46:11.340]  to world market and buy some more. Cause it is, it is heinous. I've never had, I had two things
[46:11.340 --> 46:17.940]  that I like more make something that I like less in my mouth. It was unbelievable. Here's the
[46:17.940 --> 46:24.260]  problem when I'm looking on Amazon for it, the double salt one, and it looks like most of these
[46:24.260 --> 46:29.980]  other ones come in packs of 12 for like this specific brand. And Andrew, you don't want a
[46:29.980 --> 46:36.100]  pack of one of these. To have a pack of 12 is like, that's heinous. That's enough to kill a 40
[46:36.100 --> 46:44.340]  year old. It's bad, dude. So I'm worried. What if I like this? Cause I don't like black licorice.
[46:44.900 --> 46:53.500]  Do you like eating a big handful of salt? I do. I do lean on the salt side. Andrew, that's not
[46:53.500 --> 46:58.340]  what I'm asking you. Yeah. What's this saltier than salt? What does it say for sodium on the
[46:58.340 --> 47:02.740]  back? As a child, I used to pour the salt shaker onto my hand and eat it. So I think I may have
[47:02.740 --> 47:07.360]  been training for this. Yeah. I used to do that. Did you really? Absolutely. Yeah. Back when like
[47:07.360 --> 47:11.520]  Wendy's would have the actual shakers, a little bit of salt, a little bit of pepper, 230 milligrams
[47:11.520 --> 47:19.960]  of salt, 10% of the daily value. Okay. Okay. I found on prime one day shipping Gustav's premium
[47:19.960 --> 47:28.500]  Dutch licorice drops, cats, coins, and double salt. So here's the thing, Gavin, you asked if
[47:28.500 --> 47:36.660]  there is like a trainer salt. Coins is firm with just a hint of salt. So that might be where to
[47:36.660 --> 47:42.160]  start. Oh, they've got sweet and they've got firm and there's like salty and firm. Yeah. And they
[47:42.160 --> 47:49.140]  have soft cats. Just bought it. Okay. I don't know why they are unavailable to me, but I'll,
[47:49.700 --> 47:53.360]  I'm going to post the picture so that way we have it. But why is one of them is simply called
[47:54.220 --> 48:02.060]  they have cat, they've cats. Worst case scenario, Andrew, I'll buy it here and just slow mail it
[48:02.060 --> 48:09.740]  to you. It'll cost you $45 probably. Yeah, but he's worth it. Okay. I always say that cats are
[48:09.740 --> 48:14.360]  deliciously sweet and firm. It's just when people think of cats, they always say that. Here's a
[48:14.360 --> 48:20.160]  question. What is the best animal food? Like if you're going to eat an animal or like if there's
[48:20.160 --> 48:24.160]  like a sweet or a candy that's shaped like an animal, what's the best of all time? And I've got
[48:24.640 --> 48:30.040]  the answer. I'm so glad that that's the angle you went with. I thought you were like real animals.
[48:30.160 --> 48:33.560]  If we're going to eat an animal, what would be the best animal to eat? No, I didn't think you
[48:33.560 --> 48:41.660]  were going with candy. Animal shaped. Is human considered animal? Uh, yeah. Okay. Hmm. What
[48:41.660 --> 48:54.220]  is yours, Gavin? Oh, it's definitely Percy pigs. They are absolutely out of this world. I, I will
[48:54.220 --> 48:59.960]  say we had these on face jam. Somebody sent them over and uh, oh, you've had them. Yeah. Had them
[48:59.960 --> 49:04.460]  on face, had them on face jam. Somebody sent them over and they were someone been shopping at M&S.
[49:04.840 --> 49:09.540]  Yeah, dude. They were good. They were really good. They are like the right kind of like firmness
[49:09.540 --> 49:15.500]  and they're good. I hate sweet stuff. I hate sugary shit. I just, I, chocolates. I like
[49:15.500 --> 49:23.380]  chocolate, but anything that's like just candy, I hate except for a Percy pig. Here's a, here's my
[49:24.220 --> 49:35.740]  submission. That's a, the face, the face they make at Denny's or IHOP when they give you two,
[49:36.580 --> 49:45.530]  two sunny side up eggs with bacon as a mouth. I thought we had to be Katie.
[49:47.430 --> 49:53.190]  It could be anything. It doesn't have to be candy. Uh, yeah, I guess if it's animal shaped
[49:53.190 --> 49:59.530]  regular food, the American sausage format is no good by the way. Uh, well it depends on which
[49:59.530 --> 50:02.970]  we have a lot of different kinds of sausage. Do you mean a sausage Patty? Cause that's not the
[50:02.970 --> 50:08.030]  only kind of sausage we have. Yeah, but Patty just doesn't, it doesn't work. It's not a good idea.
[50:08.590 --> 50:15.410]  I like a link as well. I don't know which I would say I like better or worse, but a sausage Patty's
[50:15.410 --> 50:20.790]  fucking awesome dude. Sausage Patties are great. Didn't do anything for me. Put it on, put it on
[50:20.790 --> 50:27.190]  a biscuit, fucking little, little sausage sandwich. God damn. Oh, delicious. I'll take a sausage
[50:27.190 --> 50:37.190]  Patty, like a sausage Bap is great, but that's sausage. Sausage Bap? What is a sausage? I don't
[50:37.830 --> 50:44.290]  know. Please. How would you describe it? How would I describe it? Yeah. Uh, I would describe it
[50:44.290 --> 50:52.550]  exactly like this. So it's, it's like, it looks like what would be a sausage Patty on like a...
[50:52.550 --> 50:59.210]  That is the least efficient way to eat a sausage sandwich on earth. They just put sausages on
[50:59.210 --> 51:05.330]  between two buns. Hold on. That one, I don't think that one has any brown sauce. That's like when you
[51:05.330 --> 51:09.650]  go to tumble 22 and you order a chicken sandwich and they give you three chicken strips on a bun.
[51:11.050 --> 51:13.910]  No, but it's not. It's perfect because they've got the squish factor. You can,
[51:14.290 --> 51:19.710]  it doesn't hold the bread up too much. Like I don't like it. I can't. That's so good. I can't.
[51:19.790 --> 51:24.110]  Are those sausages cut to lay flat or are they just round sausages that are in a bun?
[51:24.470 --> 51:27.930]  A lot of the time they'll be halved, uh, lengthways so that they can sit flat.
[51:28.210 --> 51:31.670]  So let me ask you this. When they're halved lengthways, are they still connected?
[51:31.670 --> 51:33.170]  Oh yeah, they're still connected.
[51:34.330 --> 51:37.830]  So you can take a bite and rip and then it all comes apart?
[51:38.470 --> 51:39.110]  What do you mean?
[51:39.650 --> 51:43.230]  They're still connected. So like you cut one in half and then there's two sausages,
[51:43.410 --> 51:47.390]  so they're two halved sausages, but the halved sausages are still connected?
[51:47.830 --> 51:50.930]  Well, everything's connected before you bite it. What do you mean? It's food.
[51:51.690 --> 51:59.010]  No, no, no, no, no, no. Like, like you half the sausage, but like they're still,
[51:59.010 --> 52:03.330]  it's still like connected by like the casing or whatever. Like, are they still, is there, is they?
[52:03.630 --> 52:08.510]  Oh yeah, so it's the bread and then you use your teeth, Eric, to sever the connection.
[52:09.190 --> 52:11.790]  Okay, yep. I never see how it could ever go wrong,
[52:11.850 --> 52:13.890]  not biting all the way through the casing. You're right. Nevermind.
[52:13.970 --> 52:17.130]  Like, do you want me to eat one in front of you and show you how it works?
[52:17.850 --> 52:19.230]  When given the opportunity...
[52:19.230 --> 52:23.410]  Yeah, I want you, yeah, no, I want you to eat one in front of me. Can we have one?
[52:23.630 --> 52:24.270]  I want you to show me.
[52:24.310 --> 52:28.310]  Can we eat sausage bops on the day that we film Eric throwing a frisbee?
[52:29.730 --> 52:35.230]  I'm going to take a bite of a sausage bop and throw a frisbee 30 feet in the wrong direction.
[52:38.030 --> 52:41.490]  A lot of people don't know this, but it's a thing with Gavin.
[52:41.690 --> 52:45.190]  When given the opportunity to eat food in a phallic shape, he always prefers it.
[52:46.230 --> 52:47.330]  Is that true?
[52:47.850 --> 52:48.130]  Yeah.
[52:49.490 --> 52:49.950]  Got some examples?
[52:50.090 --> 52:54.090]  What you may not know though is if you do it with sunglasses, 10% cooler.
[52:56.110 --> 52:56.950]  That's just science.
[52:57.950 --> 53:02.070]  Oh my god, this podcast, uh, I still have...
[53:02.930 --> 53:05.290]  Oh, here's why, I got my stitches out of my mouth and it sucked.
[53:05.530 --> 53:10.270]  And, uh, they lied when they said that my stitches, uh, I'm not gonna labor on my mouth.
[53:10.670 --> 53:12.770]  They lied when they said that the stitches, uh, dissolve.
[53:12.990 --> 53:14.830]  When I went in there and I'm like, I still got all these stitches.
[53:14.930 --> 53:15.810]  They're like, yeah, we'll cut them out.
[53:15.850 --> 53:16.790]  And I go, why didn't they dissolve?
[53:16.850 --> 53:18.150]  And they go, why the fuck would they dissolve?
[53:18.290 --> 53:18.890]  What are you talking about?
[53:19.790 --> 53:20.830]  You lied again!
[53:22.670 --> 53:26.130]  Uh, anyway, so, uh, my stitches are out though.
[53:26.130 --> 53:27.590]  So my life is better.
[53:27.670 --> 53:29.950]  Although, god damn it, dude, I have to go back in February.
[53:30.370 --> 53:36.150]  I can't fucking floss or use a water pick or an electric toothbrush until then.
[53:36.450 --> 53:37.370]  At least until then.
[53:38.190 --> 53:39.270]  Sucks so bad.
[53:40.030 --> 53:42.890]  I'm rinsing my mouth out like 40 times a fucking day right now.
[53:42.910 --> 53:45.050]  Because it will, like, encroach on the new gum line?
[53:45.290 --> 53:45.990]  I guess, yeah.
[53:46.010 --> 53:48.010]  It's like too dangerous to fuck with the gum line.
[53:48.450 --> 53:49.770]  Uh, which is totally different.
[53:49.890 --> 53:53.470]  Like, I've started looking at my gums now as opposed to ignoring and pretending they didn't exist.
[53:53.650 --> 53:55.730]  And it is very, it's remarkably different.
[53:56.610 --> 54:00.750]  Um, anyway, uh, that was just, I just wanted to point out that everybody lies to me all the time.
[54:02.530 --> 54:03.810]  Uh, oh, here's one.
[54:05.290 --> 54:08.350]  Uh, I invented, you know how everybody likes Wordle?
[54:09.470 --> 54:09.830]  Yeah.
[54:09.950 --> 54:10.910]  Everybody, it's like a big thing.
[54:11.030 --> 54:11.370]  A year ago, yeah.
[54:11.530 --> 54:13.810]  Yeah, well, I'm fucking, people still like it, buddy.
[54:14.530 --> 54:18.970]  Uh, I, uh, I still am in a daily Wordle text group.
[54:19.170 --> 54:20.710]  Every single day where we all do Wordle together.
[54:20.710 --> 54:27.710]  Uh, I was like, if Unifarm was smart, we'd invent the next Wordle.
[54:28.030 --> 54:29.170]  That's where the heat is, right?
[54:29.630 --> 54:30.890]  Words with friends, Wordle.
[54:31.150 --> 54:33.850]  So I thought, what's a, what's a word game you can come up with?
[54:33.930 --> 54:34.950]  Hurdle is a great one as well.
[54:35.010 --> 54:35.350]  I love Hurdle.
[54:35.610 --> 54:38.850]  What's a word game I could invent, come up with that we could then market and sell?
[54:38.990 --> 54:40.010]  And I came up with it.
[54:40.410 --> 54:41.050]  This is what it is.
[54:41.410 --> 54:47.630]  You have to spell words, but only using letters in ascending order in the alphabet.
[54:47.910 --> 54:48.250]  Okay.
[54:48.250 --> 54:50.110]  Like, for an example, boot.
[54:50.450 --> 54:52.310]  B comes before O-O-T.
[54:54.110 --> 54:54.470]  Boot.
[54:55.030 --> 54:55.210]  Okay.
[54:55.590 --> 54:55.710]  Foot.
[54:56.790 --> 54:59.370]  So far, I've only got oot words, but...
[55:01.230 --> 55:02.990]  I, I don't think that word exists.
[55:03.870 --> 55:05.030]  Ant is a great one.
[55:05.170 --> 55:08.090]  I don't think this game exists, and I think we just created it on this podcast.
[55:08.490 --> 55:09.510]  Think about it when you go home.
[55:09.710 --> 55:10.510]  Start thinking about it in your head.
[55:10.550 --> 55:17.770]  Like, what words can I spell that only go up in, uh, up the fucking, uh, what do you call it?
[55:17.770 --> 55:18.770]  With the alphabet.
[55:19.070 --> 55:19.170]  Alphabet?
[55:19.730 --> 55:20.510]  Yeah, the word alphabet.
[55:21.370 --> 55:22.530]  No, it's fine, we hacked it earlier.
[55:22.650 --> 55:23.590]  Yeah, that's true, who knows?
[55:23.670 --> 55:25.670]  Maybe we changed it to something called a different name.
[55:25.730 --> 55:26.590]  Ant, boot, uh, ain't.
[55:26.830 --> 55:27.370]  A-I-N-T.
[55:27.510 --> 55:29.550]  I feel like there won't be much surprise each day.
[55:30.770 --> 55:32.350]  What's, what's the name of this game?
[55:33.170 --> 55:33.670]  Anal Mountain.
[55:34.290 --> 55:40.990]  Uh, the word, it's, uh, word, uh, spell word ladder, uh, alphabet ladder.
[55:41.290 --> 55:41.710]  I don't know.
[55:42.270 --> 55:44.570]  Uh, we'll have to come up with a word, a name for it.
[55:44.630 --> 55:46.510]  The problem is, you can't, the alphabet.
[55:46.870 --> 55:47.230]  Spell up!
[55:47.230 --> 55:48.650]  It's called spell up!
[55:49.610 --> 55:49.670]  Okay.
[55:50.590 --> 55:51.590]  I just came up with that.
[55:51.730 --> 55:51.850]  Spell up.
[55:51.850 --> 55:52.230]  Spell up.
[55:53.390 --> 55:54.790]  But it would be spelling down?
[55:55.290 --> 55:57.210]  Because you're going down the, are you going up or down?
[55:57.210 --> 55:57.450]  We're going up.
[55:57.930 --> 56:00.970]  B-O-O-T, A-N-T, A-I-N-T.
[56:01.010 --> 56:01.710]  A is above Z?
[56:03.830 --> 56:04.670]  Well, yeah.
[56:04.890 --> 56:07.450]  A is the, A, to Andrew, A is the northernmost letter.
[56:07.970 --> 56:09.410]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[56:09.810 --> 56:13.690]  I always find it, that always mixes me up when somebody's like, I traded up the draft board.
[56:13.810 --> 56:16.310]  I never know if they mean, like, higher pick or lower pick.
[56:16.310 --> 56:17.450]  Up isn't higher?
[56:18.090 --> 56:22.290]  I've never thought about the alphabet as an ascending or descending thing.
[56:22.430 --> 56:24.990]  It always goes left to right to me.
[56:25.370 --> 56:26.070]  Yeah, left to right.
[56:26.330 --> 56:28.490]  It's just left to right, and that's it.
[56:28.810 --> 56:29.370]  How about this?
[56:29.410 --> 56:30.490]  I've never thought about going up.
[56:30.710 --> 56:31.310]  How about this?
[56:31.370 --> 56:39.550]  When we did the alphabet challenge, we numbered the letters A as 1, Z as 26.
[56:39.710 --> 56:40.330]  It went up.
[56:40.710 --> 56:43.790]  That was what, that was what made sense to us naturally in the moment.
[56:43.790 --> 56:46.090]  But is 1 to 26 horizontal?
[56:46.890 --> 56:51.250]  Well, no, that's going, like, I'm thinking about that on like a list on a piece of paper,
[56:51.350 --> 56:52.190]  and that goes down.
[56:53.290 --> 56:54.270]  Yeah, but you...
[56:54.270 --> 56:55.730]  But to get to A, you'd go up.
[56:56.450 --> 56:57.230]  Oh my god.
[56:57.830 --> 56:59.570]  It's called, it's called spell up.
[56:59.770 --> 57:03.410]  There's a reverse version of it called spell down, if you go the other way.
[57:03.730 --> 57:04.350]  That's our game.
[57:04.350 --> 57:05.810]  What are some examples of spell down?
[57:08.430 --> 57:09.390]  Uh... tree.
[57:10.330 --> 57:12.110]  T-R-E-E, tree.
[57:12.590 --> 57:15.450]  In my opinion, because A, A is the top of the ladder.
[57:16.170 --> 57:17.750]  You think A is the bottom of the ladder?
[57:18.210 --> 57:20.090]  Well, when you start, it's usually the bottom.
[57:20.350 --> 57:22.550]  Yeah, you start at 1 or A.
[57:22.850 --> 57:23.390]  That's a good point.
[57:23.590 --> 57:24.810]  Like snakes and lattice.
[57:24.930 --> 57:25.230]  That's fair.
[57:25.390 --> 57:25.550]  Yeah.
[57:25.750 --> 57:26.290]  That's true.
[57:26.550 --> 57:27.570]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[57:28.310 --> 57:29.710]  Anyway, so that's the new uniform game.
[57:29.790 --> 57:32.750]  I don't know how we monetize it, or somebody make an app for us, and we'll...
[57:33.470 --> 57:34.010]  I like it.
[57:34.010 --> 57:36.070]  Everybody will play it, and then the United Times will buy it from us.
[57:36.270 --> 57:36.670]  Word up.
[57:37.350 --> 57:37.830]  Word down.
[57:38.070 --> 57:38.530]  That's a spell up.
[57:39.050 --> 57:40.230]  I thought it was spell up.
[57:40.310 --> 57:42.050]  Is it word up, or is it spell down?
[57:42.050 --> 57:43.530]  Spell up, spell down.
[57:43.890 --> 57:45.290]  Is it spell up? It's not word up?
[57:45.590 --> 57:46.330]  No, it's spell up.
[57:46.610 --> 57:47.390]  I think word up is probably taking it.
[57:47.390 --> 57:49.010]  Word up might be harder to copyright.
[57:49.450 --> 57:49.950]  Yeah, no kidding.
[57:50.050 --> 57:50.530]  It would be tougher.
[57:50.530 --> 57:51.110]  Spell up is better.
[57:51.690 --> 57:52.990]  Okay, I have one last thing.
[57:53.750 --> 57:54.110]  Okay.
[57:54.550 --> 57:55.990]  And I almost... this is so weird.
[57:56.030 --> 58:01.310]  I almost wonder if we've discussed it in private, or even on early F*** Face before,
[58:01.390 --> 58:03.950]  but have we ever talked about like weird McDonald's facts?
[58:05.230 --> 58:06.010]  I've talked about it.
[58:06.750 --> 58:07.770]  We talked about that, right?
[58:07.790 --> 58:08.450]  We talked about the Ronald's Kiss.
[58:08.770 --> 58:09.810]  Do you guys know...
[58:10.910 --> 58:17.130]  Do you guys know who in... who created the character Ronald McDonald?
[58:17.590 --> 58:19.730]  Without looking it up, do you know who created the character?
[58:20.390 --> 58:21.270]  I do not.
[58:21.490 --> 58:22.550]  Who would you assume?
[58:23.930 --> 58:25.770]  Probably like McDonald's people or something?
[58:26.830 --> 58:28.510]  Oh, what was... what's his name?
[58:28.710 --> 58:29.270]  Michael Keaton.
[58:29.670 --> 58:30.170]  From the movie?
[58:30.630 --> 58:31.150]  Hilarious.
[58:31.250 --> 58:32.590]  Yeah, whoever he was.
[58:33.250 --> 58:39.610]  It was actually created by a famous actor, famous celebrity and actor.
[58:40.330 --> 58:43.170]  Uh, who they hired to create the character.
[58:43.730 --> 58:44.270]  Henry Winkler.
[58:45.310 --> 58:47.410]  You're not the farthest off.
[58:48.830 --> 58:50.430]  Who's the most famous clown?
[58:50.490 --> 58:51.910]  It's not... don't... he's not a clown.
[58:52.010 --> 58:53.410]  You wouldn't think of him as a clown at all.
[58:53.450 --> 58:55.390]  You wouldn't be more surprised that this was the person.
[58:55.850 --> 58:58.410]  But uh, I'll just... I don't want to keep you in suspense.
[58:58.670 --> 58:58.950]  Burt Reynolds.
[58:59.930 --> 59:01.310]  Closer... closer than Winkler.
[59:01.550 --> 59:02.470]  You're getting closer.
[59:03.590 --> 59:04.670]  Definitely from that era.
[59:05.310 --> 59:06.470]  It's definitely not Yukko.
[59:07.270 --> 59:07.750]  Uh...
[59:10.170 --> 59:11.470]  Uh... wait, where did he go?
[59:12.030 --> 59:13.210]  I wrote it down wrong, hold on a second.
[59:14.550 --> 59:15.690]  Uh... Wilford Brimley.
[59:16.350 --> 59:16.670]  Really?
[59:17.110 --> 59:17.350]  Yeah.
[59:18.170 --> 59:18.490]  Fascinating.
[59:18.930 --> 59:19.250]  When?
[59:19.410 --> 59:19.850]  It's not...
[59:19.850 --> 59:20.670]  At what point in his life?
[59:20.670 --> 59:21.530]  It's not Wilford Brimley.
[59:21.630 --> 59:22.630]  Oh, I'm sorry, is it Willard Scott?
[59:23.130 --> 59:24.130]  It's Willard Scott!
[59:24.250 --> 59:25.090]  Yeah, it's Willard Scott.
[59:25.330 --> 59:26.030]  Sorry, I wrote it down wrong.
[59:26.470 --> 59:27.690]  Can we do a take two on that?
[59:27.770 --> 59:29.250]  Geoff, you should do the reveal one more.
[59:29.310 --> 59:31.130]  I cannot believe that fucking happened.
[59:31.310 --> 59:32.270]  No, I wrote it down wrong.
[59:32.430 --> 59:33.690]  I don't know why I wrote down Wilford Brimley.
[59:37.590 --> 59:38.470]  It's just...
[59:38.470 --> 59:41.310]  Willard Scott is so much of a less cool thing.
[59:41.950 --> 59:44.730]  It's so much less... I don't even know who Willard Scott is.
[59:44.990 --> 59:45.750]  Who's Willard Scott?
[59:46.230 --> 59:47.390]  You don't know who Willard Scott is?
[59:47.890 --> 59:50.190]  No, I have no idea who... I know who Wilford Brimley is.
[59:50.190 --> 59:51.310]  Yeah, I've seen him in The Thing.
[59:52.070 --> 59:52.950]  I've seen... he's great in The Thing.
[59:52.950 --> 59:54.010]  Willard Scott is, uh...
[59:54.010 --> 59:54.350]  Who's Willard Scott?
[59:54.350 --> 59:55.250]  Oh my god, there he is.
[59:55.450 --> 59:59.830]  He's a... he's a famous American, uh... like, weatherman?
[01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:00.990]  Like, TV personality?
[01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:05.070]  He was on the Today Show doing weather since, like, the 80s.
[01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:09.450]  Your delivery of, oh my god, there he is, was like, he walked by your window.
[01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:10.290]  No, he's dead.
[01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:11.170]  Not that you Googled it.
[01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:16.210]  Uh, Geoff, you should reveal who it is one more time.
[01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:18.370]  That was way cool when it was Wilford Brimley.
[01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:18.970]  Yes, it was.
[01:00:18.970 --> 01:00:20.230]  I don't know why it was so confusing.
[01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:22.990]  That's why I confused myself, because I wrote down Wilford Brimley, but it's Willard Scott.
[01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:25.510]  I like that you stopped to check and then said Wilford Brimley.
[01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:26.950]  And I went like, no, what?
[01:00:27.130 --> 01:00:27.490]  No, yeah.
[01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:36.790]  So, uh, Willard Scott created Ronald McDonald, and they fired him as Ronald McDonald because
[01:00:36.790 --> 01:00:38.210]  he got too fat.
[01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:40.390]  Really?
[01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:44.610]  Yeah, and they didn't want Ronald McDonald to look like he was unhealthy.
[01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:47.370]  They didn't want him to look like he was eating McDonald's.
[01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:51.410]  Yeah, he was also, uh, a Bozo the Clown.
[01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:53.730]  He was a... he was... he played Bozo the Clown for a long time.
[01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:55.710]  That's...
[01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:56.230]  So he was...
[01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:59.170]  I mean, I didn't know who he was, so this is less interesting, but this is...
[01:00:59.170 --> 01:01:01.930]  I really didn't think you wouldn't know who Willard Scott was, but...
[01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:03.390]  I've never heard of him.
[01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:03.750]  You also...
[01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:07.270]  You just referenced the Fonz as the pinnacle of cool.
[01:01:07.290 --> 01:01:08.630]  I guess it's pretty similar.
[01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:09.550]  I feel like this is pretty American.
[01:01:12.310 --> 01:01:13.230]  That's the Willard Scott.
[01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:15.210]  Oh, he has a cup on his nose?
[01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:17.970]  I don't think I've ever seen that person.
[01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.130]  Yeah.
[01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:18.710]  Really?
[01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:19.490]  Oh my God.
[01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:20.110]  What's he been in?
[01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:22.450]  What has he been in?
[01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:23.970]  He's been in films?
[01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:26.310]  He's been on TV every day for the last, like, 60 years in America.
[01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:26.930]  Yeah, but TV's not...
[01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:29.850]  The weather isn't international.
[01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:32.090]  No, but it's...
[01:01:32.090 --> 01:01:34.510]  But it's, like, nationally syndicated in America.
[01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:37.890]  Like, if you turned on the Today Show, any city in America, you'd see him.
[01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:42.830]  Any city in America.
[01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:45.270]  You're talking to a Canadian and a guy that grew up in Europe.
[01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:48.370]  I'm talking to somebody who lives on the border and a guy who's lived in America for a decade.
[01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:50.870]  Has he been alive for the last decade?
[01:01:51.930 --> 01:01:52.330]  What's that?
[01:01:53.070 --> 01:01:54.090]  When did he die?
[01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:56.530]  What sort of weather was he doing in the last decade?
[01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:57.610]  Willard Scott?
[01:01:58.850 --> 01:01:59.810]  What do you want to know?
[01:01:59.910 --> 01:02:00.630]  What's going on?
[01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:02.610]  What are you asking me?
[01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:06.470]  I'm just saying I think it's weird that Willard Scott created Ronald McDonald, okay?
[01:02:09.030 --> 01:02:13.650]  A fucking famous American weatherman created Ronald McDonald,
[01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:14.890]  and you don't think that's weird?
[01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:18.790]  It's not... I mean, I wouldn't...
[01:02:18.790 --> 01:02:22.250]  If you would have guessed what profession did the inventor of Ronald McDonald have,
[01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:23.530]  I wouldn't have said weatherman.
[01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:28.230]  But not knowing who this person is really takes out the shock of the moment.
[01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:30.430]  I'm both learning who they are and what they did.
[01:02:30.490 --> 01:02:31.890]  I see. I see your... yeah.
[01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:35.070]  Well, for people who know who Willard Scott is, it's very surprising.
[01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:38.110]  That's great. I'm happy for those.
[01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:39.150]  I bet you those people are shocked.
[01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:40.290]  He's more famous than...
[01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:41.090]  Sorry that I'm the wrong audience.
[01:02:41.350 --> 01:02:42.710]  He's more famous than...
[01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:45.650]  I don't know why I wrote down Wilford Brimley. That was so confusing.
[01:02:46.070 --> 01:02:51.330]  He's more famous than all the people you talk about from England who we've never heard of.
[01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.810]  Okay, like who?
[01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:55.010]  I don't know because I've never heard of him.
[01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:59.070]  Next time I shot myself in the foot with Brimley.
[01:02:59.170 --> 01:03:00.270]  I did, it was so confusing.
[01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.910]  All right, because I don't know why I wrote down Wilford Brimley.
[01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:05.550]  Brimley would have been mind-blowing.
[01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:10.450]  I know, it was so weird that I wrote that down wrong.
[01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:12.210]  Okay, but moving on.
[01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:14.670]  Do you know what the Hamburglar's full name is?
[01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:17.430]  That was the best fact ever on the podcast.
[01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:18.950]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:20.270]  Do you know what the...
[01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:21.690]  No, I don't.
[01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:22.970]  What is the Hamburglar's name?
[01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:25.010]  His full name is Wilford Brimley.
[01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:29.090]  No, the Hamburglar's full name is Hamilton B. Ergler.
[01:03:29.530 --> 01:03:30.790]  Oh, that's great.
[01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:32.290]  Which I think is an awesome name.
[01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:33.250]  Hamilton B. Ergler.
[01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:37.050]  Did you guys know that Grimace has a family?
[01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:42.490]  He's got a grandmother named Winky and his great-grandmother is named Jimmy Grimace.
[01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:45.390]  And his brother's name is King Gonga.
[01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:47.670]  I did.
[01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:50.470]  I have looked into the family tree because it's fucking wild.
[01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:52.070]  There's an Irish one, right?
[01:03:52.570 --> 01:03:54.510]  I don't know. That's all I know about is King Gonga.
[01:03:54.590 --> 01:03:55.810]  I thought that was the interesting one.
[01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:57.730]  His brother is like the...
[01:03:58.390 --> 01:04:00.450]  His brother King Gonga is the...
[01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:04.470]  He's the leader of the Grimace people, I guess.
[01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:06.730]  He's like the king of all the Grimaces.
[01:04:07.170 --> 01:04:09.690]  Irish Grimace is Uncle O' Grimacy.
[01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:11.030]  And he was...
[01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:11.450]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:14.030]  He was for the Shamrock Shake, I believe.
[01:04:14.570 --> 01:04:16.170]  Yes, that is exactly right.
[01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:21.050]  Okay, so are we going to clip that O out and put it on a soundboard?
[01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:23.430]  Because that was like a perfect...
[01:04:24.550 --> 01:04:25.930]  That was a great O.
[01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:28.490]  It was. That was a fantastic delivery.
[01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:30.690]  I'm self-conscious about my O's now.
[01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:31.830]  You should be.
[01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:33.030]  That looks like...
[01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:33.350]  They're great.
[01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:35.530]  It doesn't even look like that was actually green.
[01:04:35.650 --> 01:04:38.530]  It just looks like someone changed the white balance on a different Grimace.
[01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:41.190]  Have you seen like the original Grimace?
[01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:42.290]  With the four arms?
[01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:43.810]  Yeah, with like the bunch of arms.
[01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:44.790]  Yeah.
[01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:46.030]  Have you seen this, Gavin?
[01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:47.530]  Are you aware of multi-armed Grimace?
[01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:48.710]  Don't know about that.
[01:04:48.730 --> 01:04:49.850]  Oh God, it's terrifying.
[01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:52.230]  Grimace was all about like getting shakes.
[01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:53.790]  He was like a shakes guy.
[01:04:57.090 --> 01:04:58.390]  So that's Grimace.
[01:05:00.790 --> 01:05:02.730]  There you go. Those are my McDonald's facts.
[01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:04.630]  They were amazing.
[01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:08.210]  I wish to God I hadn't written down Wilford Brimley, but...
[01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:08.950]  I'm so glad you did.
[01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:11.310]  It seems that I did, for some reason.
[01:05:11.790 --> 01:05:13.770]  When I meant to write down Willard Scott.
[01:05:14.330 --> 01:05:17.630]  Who, in my mind, are very similar.
[01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:19.810]  Old fat dudes from the 60s.
[01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:24.490]  We wrap this up, I have to go.
[01:05:24.850 --> 01:05:26.030]  I have to catch a flight.
[01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:27.930]  Oh, did your cucumber get returned?
[01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:28.630]  No!
[01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:32.530]  No, I need time to drop off another one on the way.
[01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:34.990]  Do you have to catch a flight?
[01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.990]  So when is your flight?
[01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:37.330]  Like four days from now?
[01:05:39.010 --> 01:05:42.350]  No, being in the city, it's easy.
[01:05:42.350 --> 01:05:44.470]  I'm not on the island right now.
[01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:45.850]  Oh, you're in Austin.
[01:05:46.050 --> 01:05:46.470]  Where are you staying?
[01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:47.410]  Yeah, I'm in Austin.
[01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:50.290]  I'm staying at the Hilton by the convention center.
[01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:55.270]  Because we've had a debate about fucking sneakiness and how sneaky I was.
[01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:56.830]  You guys were saying I wasn't sneaky.
[01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:58.750]  It's what started this whole thing.
[01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:00.990]  So I start with the cucumber photo.
[01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:04.210]  Yesterday, I text Gavin saying,
[01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:06.550]  do you have a favorite lunch or dinner spot?
[01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:07.870]  And he was useless.
[01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:11.190]  He provided zero information at all.
[01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:14.290]  You were just going to send your little helper to wherever that was.
[01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:16.030]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:06:17.010 --> 01:06:17.550]  I would not.
[01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:20.410]  I would go there myself because I'm in Austin right now.
[01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:23.450]  So I asked Geoff later in the evening.
[01:06:23.890 --> 01:06:27.750]  He recommended a donut place called S-H Donuts.
[01:06:27.890 --> 01:06:28.370]  Shithead Donuts.
[01:06:28.410 --> 01:06:28.770]  So I went there.
[01:06:29.970 --> 01:06:30.630]  I went there.
[01:06:31.330 --> 01:06:39.290]  Did you also have your table and Windex and grilled cheese maker in Austin?
[01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:40.830]  No, I did not.
[01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:41.910]  I wouldn't travel with that.
[01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:43.390]  So this is this is me this morning.
[01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:44.030]  I picked some up.
[01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:44.810]  Geoff, you're right.
[01:06:44.970 --> 01:06:45.850]  Kalachis were delicious.
[01:06:46.330 --> 01:06:46.810]  Donuts were good.
[01:06:47.610 --> 01:06:49.110]  I took a few photos of the store.
[01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:51.150]  Went in.
[01:06:52.070 --> 01:06:52.810]  No, I'm in.
[01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:55.490]  I have to leave for a flight.
[01:06:56.110 --> 01:06:57.850]  Now I'm just imagining that that's you.
[01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:00.250]  Like, you're the pickle.
[01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:02.090]  Looking at...
[01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:03.690]  I'm not the pickle.
[01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:05.030]  I'm the one taking the photo.
[01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:07.830]  Goddamn.
[01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:08.450]  I've been all over.
[01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:08.990]  Well, well...
[01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:11.290]  You do not believe I'm in a hotel right now?
[01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:12.830]  Why don't we get a picture of you?
[01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:14.470]  Why do we only get the cucumber?
[01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:17.410]  We've never had a picture of him the entire face.
[01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:18.510]  Yeah, I don't.
[01:07:18.530 --> 01:07:19.130]  I don't do that.
[01:07:19.970 --> 01:07:22.050]  Nixon, do GTA 6 footage.
[01:07:25.930 --> 01:07:26.670]  This is me.
[01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:28.590]  It's me outside.
[01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:29.990]  Helping.
[01:07:31.450 --> 01:07:33.690]  Hey, what was the weather like today?
[01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:36.490]  It's fine.
[01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:42.480]  You're such a little asshole.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.160]  No, I'm...
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:44.640]  What do you mean?
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:45.300]  I'm in.
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:46.580]  I'm here. I gotta go, though.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:48.080]  Because we have the recording tomorrow.
[01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:51.220]  We all agreed recently we never record anything in person.
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.720]  Yeah, but we said we never record anything in person.
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:54.460]  So I have to go.
[01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:56.020]  It's going to be a late flight.
[01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:58.360]  And I'm going to have to leave in the morning to make it before we record.
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:07:59.500]  So I was worried about it.
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:02.640]  Someone did point out that you actually are very sneaky in the fact that
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.920]  you managed to come to pinballs with me and I had no recollection.
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:06.320]  Yeah.
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:08.580]  Here, I'll take a photo.
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:10.200]  Let me take a photo of my desk with the mic.
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:10.920]  Okay.
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:14.380]  I was worried it would sound bad because I'm using the snowball.
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:16.680]  I didn't want to bring a fucking XLR cable.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:19.660]  I brought a few essentials, actually, with me for the desk.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:20.540]  How long...
[01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:20.940]  Because it's important.
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:24.380]  How long do you pretend that you've been in Austin?
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:25.980]  I've been in Austin since Monday.
[01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:26.540]  Early Monday.
[01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:27.220]  Today is...
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:28.440]  I don't know why you think I'm pretending. Here.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:34.580]  Why would you come to Austin, stay for four days, five days,
[01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:39.980]  and not see what I'm assuming are two of your best friends in the world?
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.360]  Because that's how fucking sneaky I am.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:47.120]  That I've been in this city for a week, you haven't encountered me.
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:50.200]  And I put the cucumber down. I was here for business, Geoff.
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:51.220]  This wasn't a pleasure trip.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:54.500]  What did you think of the new immigration?
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:56.840]  What are you talking about?
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:57.800]  To get into the U.S.
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.540]  What do you mean?
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.840]  I mean, post-COVID.
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.320]  That's what it was. There's not really restrictions.
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:09.040]  But what did you think of the new thing they've got?
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:10.560]  Why isn't this...
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:13.080]  One second. My photos are fucking...
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:15.040]  Here. Here we go.
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.460]  It's me. Right now.
[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:20.600]  Got my mic. Got my cucumber.
[01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:21.980]  Got your Icy Hot.
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:22.320]  Got my Icy Hot.
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.160]  I've been Icy Hotting every time.
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:30.380]  Okay, so this is our current Discord window.
[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:31.420]  Yeah.
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:32.000]  We're open on that.
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:33.260]  Because it's me.
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:36.320]  So is that, like, in the room?
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.580]  And that is a shithead donut.
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:40.460]  Bag right there.
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:41.840]  This is my... my window sucks.
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:42.760]  I'd show you the outside.
[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:43.520]  This is my window.
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:44.660]  It fucking stinks.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:47.820]  Who is in our Discord that isn't you?
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:49.100]  But that's the thing.
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:49.700]  They're not.
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.160]  And I'm looking because I'm like, oh, maybe it's like a screen grab.
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:53.060]  But it's like the browser.
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:55.360]  It's like the browser and everything.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:56.280]  He's...
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:56.780]  I need to go.
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:57.760]  He's...
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.300]  I have a flight to catch.
[01:09:58.300 --> 01:09:59.440]  What he's done is he's...
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:09:59.980]  I love you guys.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.980]  He's got someone to log into his Discord.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.240]  What is happening?
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:03.980]  Or they're just...
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:05.100]  How would I be here?
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:06.060]  They're sending him photos.
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.280]  And then...
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.520]  Oh my God.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:10.320]  This is just how they...
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.200]  This is exactly how they tricked Manti Teo.
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:13.600]  I watched the documentary.
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:14.900]  This is exactly...
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:16.520]  We're a bunch of Manti Teos.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.040]  Did Andrew just leave?
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:18.900]  This motherfucker.
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.460]  Is he in the room next door?
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:21.220]  Like...
[01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:22.960]  This Manti Teo motherfucker.
[01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:24.820]  He got us.
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.320]  What the fuck?
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:27.420]  It's good.
[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:28.120]  He did good.
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.520]  I'll say he did good.
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:30.560]  It's...
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:34.400]  Is he just sending screenshots that are being opened full screen?
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:37.020]  Currently on someone else's laptop?
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:38.260]  I think it's...
[01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:43.780]  I think it's more likely that he has someone else who is in Austin in a hotel.
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:45.460]  And he just asked...
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:47.180]  Yeah, but this...
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:50.680]  Does that cucumber match the ones in the photos?
[01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:52.320]  Uh...
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:53.260]  Does it match?
[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:54.560]  There's an indention...
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:58.120]  We're gonna have to forensic how he's not here.
[01:10:58.460 --> 01:10:59.380]  I will say the...
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.540]  Sure as shit not in Austin though.
[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:06.260]  The cucumber in the window reflection looks different than the one outside.
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.740]  And then different again inside.
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:09.580]  There's a...
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:10.560]  This one's pointier.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:15.200]  He could have turned Nick or Eric.
[01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:16.040]  I...
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:16.740]  I swear...
[01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:22.280]  I don't know how to assure you that I'm not because this is fucking crazy.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:23.540]  I'll say this...
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:26.020]  We might need to see live pictures from Eric and Nick's setups.
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:26.680]  Okay, how do you...
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:27.180]  What do you want me...
[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:27.780]  Here, okay.
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:29.400]  Rep...
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:29.820]  Here you go.
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:31.660]  I can assure you it's not me.
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:35.040]  But if you look in the bottom left corner, that looks like Eric's little...
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:35.320]  It's not...
[01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:36.840]  I have nothing...
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:38.620]  What do you want me to do right now?
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:40.480]  Because this is blowing my mind.
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:41.540]  It's Eric.
[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:44.220]  Eric, you forgot to remove your name from that screenshot.
[01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:45.540]  It's not...
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:46.920]  I don't know what...
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:47.820]  Eric, you goofed!
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:48.300]  This...
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:50.560]  This sucks because it's...
[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:52.080]  It's not me!
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:53.040]  It's you!
[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:56.800]  He created a dummy Eric and Geoff and Gavin and me, remember?
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:57.320]  He did!
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.800]  Oh, is he using his second Eric?
[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:01.260]  What the fuck?!
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:01.860]  He's gonna throw you under the bus!
[01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:03.840]  You guys start accusing me, it's not me!
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.240]  I don't know what's going on!
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:06.180]  What says Eric Badour in the screenshot?
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:07.280]  This sucks.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:10.200]  What the fuck?
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:11.380]  He's making us eat each other.
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:12.980]  Huh.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:13.720]  This...
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:15.500]  He's even got audacity open.
[01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:17.680]  I don't...
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:19.280]  There's attention to detail here that...
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.000]  It's pretty insane.
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:24.220]  We need to go, also.
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:25.820]  Like...
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:26.660]  This is more important.
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:27.700]  But I can't crack this.
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:28.880]  I don't know what's going on.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:31.840]  So he's got secret Eric appearing offline, maybe?
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:36.400]  I'll say this, I don't think Eric's going down to the Hilton and taking photos of shit.
[01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:38.560]  No, fuck no, absolutely not.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:39.320]  What the fuck?
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:40.380]  No, absolutely not.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:43.820]  And there's definitely a Christmas tree in that reflection.
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:51.360]  I was just worried that Eric had sent a screenshot of our Discord to Andrew to send to his crony.
[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:54.640]  That's so much...
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:56.120]  Andrew just sent a message that said,
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.740]  Sorry for leaving early.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.500]  My flight leaves in an hour and I'm worried about making it.
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.200]  And then sent another picture of the laptop.
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:04.760]  His flight does not leave in an hour. There's no way.
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:05.740]  Is there a flight at a lot?
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.820]  What flight is from to Vancouver?
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:11.380]  The one leaving at 6.25?
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.780]  We have to go long just to forensic this.
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:15.400]  Yeah, we do.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:16.920]  Flights.
[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:18.740]  Flights.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:21.200]  But here's the thing, he might not be going to Vancouver.
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:22.440]  He might layover in Chicago.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:23.800]  He might layover in Seattle.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:25.500]  He might layover in LA or San Francisco.
[01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:27.220]  Oh.
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:27.780]  Yeah.
[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:32.400]  There's no... yeah, there's probably nothing direct to Vancouver.
[01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:35.400]  Today is Thursday, December 1st.
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:37.080]  Yeah.
[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:39.260]  He could?
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:41.660]  This is way more advanced than I initially thought.
[01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:43.100]  God damn it, he could.
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:47.380]  I mean, there's a flight out at 9pm tonight that gets him home at noon tomorrow.
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:50.280]  Can we see... okay, so Eric's offline account...
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:52.820]  There's a fucking flight at 7.45 tonight.
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:55.220]  There's a flight at 6.18.
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:56.480]  This...
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:56.720]  Oh no.
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.160]  This little shit.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:01.680]  By everyone's name on Discord, it's like a four-digit number afterwards.
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:02.320]  Yeah.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:05.440]  The fake Eric has a certain four-digit number.
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:06.660]  Can we see that in...
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:08.880]  I can show you mine.
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:10.740]  Let's see if we can see it.
[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:12.060]  But I don't know how to see theirs.
[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:14.960]  Uh, fuck, I can't.
[01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:18.180]  Yeah, it's too... oh, it needs to be slightly higher res.
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:19.900]  Because I can't read the number under his name.
[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:21.340]  Mine is that.
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:23.420]  And that's really hard to read.
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:24.700]  That doesn't look right though.
[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:26.700]  That doesn't look like those numbers, does it?
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:27.600]  No, it's not.
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:31.060]  His looks like it ends in a 7 or a 1.
[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:31.520]  Right.
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:32.640]  Oh, it ends in a 7.
[01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:33.820]  The fake Eric ends in a 7.
[01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:34.420]  Yeah.
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:35.820]  Interesting.
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:36.940]  I've been framed.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:39.880]  Why wouldn't he use his own fake account?
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:41.740]  Did he not make a fake Andrew?
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:42.740]  He might not have.
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:43.520]  He might not have.
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:44.060]  No, he did.
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:47.700]  So he does have a fake Andrew, but he didn't use that for the screenshot?
[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:49.140]  Maybe he didn't know the login.
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:53.100]  I'm so confused.
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:54.460]  This little shithead.
[01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:55.400]  He did a good job.
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:56.060]  I'll give him that.
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:57.520]  I'll give him that.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:58.240]  That's good work.
[01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:03.540]  He must have been slathered in icy hot today because he was on point with this.
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:07.260]  I bet he's just sat watching us still in this chat room.
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:07.700]  Definitely.
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:11.120]  And he says, Nick said he may have wanted to cause an issue for Eric.
[01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:11.840]  I agree.
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.600]  I think that's exactly what he wanted to do.
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:14.920]  Now, that's an interesting point.
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:16.720]  That is an interesting point.
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.140]  Why not sow doubt elsewhere?
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:18.740]  Yeah.
[01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:21.560]  It's a brilliant deflection on his part.
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:23.440]  We were ready to burn you to the ground.
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:24.800]  Yeah, that sucks.
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:26.340]  That sucks.
[01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:27.860]  Didn't do anything.
[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:33.100]  Oh, is there any other info?
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:36.080]  I knew I knew he was up to something when he asked me my favorite,
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:37.700]  my favorite breakfast place in Austin.
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:40.360]  I didn't think it was this, but I knew he was up to something.
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.120]  It's a Mac Pro with a touch bar.
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.880]  It is a Mac Pro with a touch bar.
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:47.260]  Now, let's think.
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:47.920]  A couple years ago.
[01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:53.980]  In that most recent pic, can you see the little car, the little envelope that holds the key cards?
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.640]  Can you see what the name is?
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:57.260]  Yeah, no.
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:02.540]  No, it's, I think it's Hilton.
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:03.560]  I don't know.
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:04.340]  It's hard to say.
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.940]  It could be an advertisement for anything.
[01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:09.080]  I want to know who he's turned.
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.160]  It's got to be someone who works for us though, right?
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.900]  Otherwise, otherwise he's letting strangers into the Discord.
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:16.160]  You think it's, you think it's Jack?
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.300]  You think it could be Jack?
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:18.540]  Can I ask this?
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:19.880]  I'm doing some investigating.
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:20.660]  I'm looking at these pictures.
[01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:22.580]  What is that microphone plugged into?
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:28.860]  Uh...
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:31.140]  Oh, it's off to the side.
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:32.480]  But it's plugged into something.
[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:33.900]  Yeah, what is it plugged into?
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:36.540]  Whatever it's plugged into isn't plugged into the laptop, right?
[01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:37.560]  That's only one cable.
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:38.300]  Right.
[01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:42.540]  Because if you look at the other pictures, I'm looking at like the original one, this,
[01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:45.080]  it's not plugged into the laptop.
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:47.580]  And it's, well, it's muted too.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:49.100]  Or is that the power light?
[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:51.500]  I don't know how Yeti works.
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:58.380]  Also, interestingly in the image, he's not a member of any other recording groups.
[01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:00.520]  Although I guess he only does this podcast with us.
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:01.960]  So that is possible.
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:05.000]  But I think I've got like a million of them on mine.
[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:05.840]  Yeah, me too.
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:10.700]  The mic is clearly on because the light's on, but it's not plugged into that laptop.
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.120]  So it's plugged into something else.
[01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:15.300]  Because maybe he forgot the dongles for that laptop.
[01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:18.980]  Does it, maybe, uh, is it a, is it a USB powered mic?
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:19.800]  Yes.
[01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:20.660]  Yeah, it is.
[01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:22.580]  So it doesn't need phantom power or anything.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.940]  And it's probably a big fat mini USB plug on the mic end.
[01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:27.940]  Is...
[01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:30.990]  Huh.
[01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.830]  He's done us.
[01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:36.450]  Yeah, I don't know that we're going to crack this beyond what we've got.
[01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:39.510]  I think we've done some good forensics though.
[01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:40.390]  I agree.
[01:17:40.770 --> 01:17:42.150]  I think we've gotten a lot out of it.
[01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:43.750]  I mean, clearly it's not him.
[01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:44.110]  We know he's not here.
[01:17:44.370 --> 01:17:44.830]  It's not him.
[01:17:45.090 --> 01:17:46.090]  He's definitely not here.
[01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:48.470]  Oh, he's fucking, he did a good job though.
[01:17:48.570 --> 01:17:49.550]  He did a good job.
[01:17:50.190 --> 01:17:51.610]  Did a real good job.
[01:17:51.610 --> 01:17:52.410]  Theta plug that?
[01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:54.650]  Wait, where's it in this other photo?
[01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:56.090]  Yeah, you just can't tell.
[01:17:56.730 --> 01:17:57.110]  All right.
[01:17:57.170 --> 01:17:58.370]  Well, I guess we should end it then.
[01:17:58.730 --> 01:17:59.130]  Okay.
[01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.890]  Wow.
[01:18:01.670 --> 01:18:04.290]  I almost want to drive down to the fucking Hilton now.
[01:18:04.670 --> 01:18:05.430]  But he's gone.
[01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:06.350]  He's going to the airport.
[01:18:06.810 --> 01:18:07.490]  Oh yeah, right.
[01:18:07.710 --> 01:18:08.170]  Sure he is.
[01:18:08.530 --> 01:18:09.750]  Let's beat him to the airport.
[01:18:11.050 --> 01:18:13.110]  He's got such a jump on me from where I live.
[01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:15.490]  We should all go to the airport right this second.
[01:18:15.810 --> 01:18:16.330]  Oh my god.
[01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:18.490]  Who's the closest to the airport?
[01:18:18.490 --> 01:18:19.130]  It's not me.
[01:18:19.170 --> 01:18:19.250]  Oh my god.
[01:18:20.210 --> 01:18:21.010]  Oh man.
[01:18:21.010 --> 01:18:21.890]  This little turd.
[01:18:22.770 --> 01:18:23.150]  All right.
[01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:24.490]  Well, thanks for listening to F*** Face.
[01:18:25.390 --> 01:18:27.070]  That was such a weird ending.
[01:18:29.230 --> 01:18:32.490]  I mean, he just, he did such a good job.
[01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:37.130]  We're going to have to take that picture for the video version and like zoom around on it.
[01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:37.890]  Yeah.
[01:18:38.490 --> 01:18:40.070]  Let people see what we're looking at.
[01:18:40.210 --> 01:18:43.170]  This little, this little shithead man, two episodes in a row.
[01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:44.810]  He made the website and then he did this.
[01:18:44.890 --> 01:18:45.690]  He pulled this thing off.
[01:18:45.730 --> 01:18:46.910]  He's been on fire lately.
[01:18:47.310 --> 01:18:47.950]  Yeah, he's been busy.
[01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:50.230]  He is bathing in icy hot.
[01:18:50.230 --> 01:18:53.810]  I guarantee you every f***ing day coming up with this stuff.
[01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:55.170]  I wish you could...
[01:18:55.170 --> 01:18:56.070]  His ears are just soaked.
[01:18:56.270 --> 01:19:01.610]  I wish you could see who the person in the reflection is taking the photo, but you can't.
[01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:04.490]  It's cleverly angled.
[01:19:04.670 --> 01:19:05.430]  Yeah, it is clever.
[01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:07.190]  But it is a room that faces into the lobby.
[01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:12.730]  But we do know that he, uh, he is good about angling himself out of reflections and photos.
[01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:17.170]  He, well, he's not, I don't know about, I don't know if he's good about it, but he does do it.
[01:19:17.370 --> 01:19:17.690]  Yeah.
[01:19:18.410 --> 01:19:18.810]  Huh.
[01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:19.770]  All right.
[01:19:20.850 --> 01:19:21.870]  Lidocaine icy hot.
[01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:23.210]  Yeah.
[01:19:24.210 --> 01:19:25.010]  That's the...
[01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:25.490]  Where's mine?
[01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:27.910]  Is that just a standard?
[01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:31.490]  No, I think lidocaine is like a stronger ingredient.
[01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:33.530]  Um, but that's like the roll-on.
[01:19:33.650 --> 01:19:35.750]  I don't think, I don't think the roll-on works as well, personally.
[01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:37.810]  Uh, all right.
[01:19:37.850 --> 01:19:39.970]  Anyway, uh, let's end it on a high note.
[01:19:40.730 --> 01:19:46.070]  Uh, thanks for listening to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:19:46.570 --> 01:19:50.790]  Uh, gosh, I hope you enjoyed it because we sure had fun making it.
[01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:54.090]  Well, at least those of us who could be bothered to stick around until the end did.
[01:19:54.250 --> 01:19:56.710]  Some of us, uh, not so much.
[01:19:57.230 --> 01:19:58.490]  Hopefully we'll see you next week.
[01:19:58.690 --> 01:20:02.690]  Oh, and by the way, thank you for, uh, all the people that sent us the lovely Spotify
[01:20:02.690 --> 01:20:07.050]  wrapped thing showing us that F*** Face is your number one listen to or in the top five
[01:20:07.050 --> 01:20:07.630]  you're listened to.
[01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:10.830]  Those are, those sure are delightful to see, and we appreciate the support.
[01:20:11.150 --> 01:20:14.070]  And, uh, we'll see you next time, I guess.
[01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:15.530]  Hey, guys.
[01:20:15.670 --> 01:20:19.130]  Pinch-hitter Greg from Finance here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:20.750]  Gavin has a giant foot.
[01:20:21.330 --> 01:20:23.230]  Cartoons are funny when they're about us.
[01:20:23.690 --> 01:20:25.490]  The speed of chug is now measurable.
[01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:26.970]  Eric got older.
[01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:29.170]  So much older.
[01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:31.010]  Train conductors chug beer.
[01:20:31.570 --> 01:20:33.150]  Panama Jack really let himself go.
[01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:35.490]  And Andrew does not eat the pencil.
