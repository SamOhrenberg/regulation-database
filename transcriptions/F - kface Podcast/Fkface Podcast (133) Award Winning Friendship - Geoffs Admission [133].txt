[00:00.000 --> 00:05.520]  Hello! I am interrupting, I believe, the start of an episode, because this is... we recorded this
[00:05.520 --> 00:12.260]  ahead of time. We got nominated for a People's Signal Award as the Best Buddy Podcast, I believe,
[00:12.560 --> 00:17.080]  which is absurd. We're excited about it. We've never been nominated for an award before,
[00:17.580 --> 00:22.940]  so I'm here to talk about it and ask you to please vote for us if you wouldn't mind. It would be...
[00:22.940 --> 00:28.580]  to have an award-winning f*** face would be hilarious. On top of the fact that it is...
[00:28.580 --> 00:32.840]  for the Best Buddy category, which is an all-time flex to tell anybody in my life,
[00:32.940 --> 00:37.480]  I'm an award-winning friend. So please, if you wouldn't mind, I'm sure there are links in the
[00:37.480 --> 00:41.840]  show notes, give us a vote. We would really appreciate it. Thank you. Have a great day.
[00:42.100 --> 00:42.640]  Enjoy the episode!
[00:58.660 --> 01:03.980]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast. My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me,
[01:04.060 --> 01:08.740]  as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free, in no particular order, as long as they're behind me
[01:09.300 --> 01:13.240]  in that order. This is episode 133.
[01:13.800 --> 01:14.240]  Hello.
[01:15.000 --> 01:20.120]  Hello. This is... sorry. I was just thinking. I just realized that we're recording two today.
[01:20.400 --> 01:23.180]  I have to do something between episodes quickly when we stop.
[01:24.040 --> 01:24.760]  Places to be?
[01:24.880 --> 01:29.260]  I'm back. No, not places to be. I just... I realized I'm supposed to chug a thing of
[01:29.260 --> 01:32.080]  Bovril and I don't have that, so I'll quickly put that together.
[01:32.340 --> 01:34.480]  Oh yeah, you talked that up massively last episode.
[01:34.480 --> 01:40.880]  I did, and I need to deliver on it. I got my Gerpler. It's now here. I'm now back. I'm back
[01:40.880 --> 01:47.640]  in my comfortable situation that I'm used to. No longer in a different country. It was an exhausting
[01:47.640 --> 01:49.200]  trip, but I'm glad to be back.
[01:49.480 --> 01:54.880]  Have you, by any chance, listened to the additional 12 minutes of forensics we had to do after you left
[01:54.880 --> 01:55.560]  the last episode?
[01:55.680 --> 01:56.320]  No, I didn't.
[01:57.480 --> 02:00.920]  Why did you need to do forensics? It was clearly there. Did you not think I was there?
[02:01.040 --> 02:01.940]  Oh, just listen.
[02:02.440 --> 02:03.020]  Just listen?
[02:03.020 --> 02:05.020]  We put our sleuthing caps on.
[02:05.500 --> 02:11.220]  Really? Okay, well, if you didn't think I was there, which it sounds like you guys didn't,
[02:11.260 --> 02:12.640]  then how would I have the photos?
[02:14.360 --> 02:16.740]  We discussed this in detail.
[02:17.080 --> 02:17.260]  Yeah.
[02:17.720 --> 02:18.440]  You did? Okay.
[02:18.820 --> 02:23.860]  Like Nick says, they thought about adding us to the CSI family.
[02:26.140 --> 02:30.100]  Hey, Eric, did you submit us to any other awards or just that one?
[02:30.100 --> 02:36.620]  I nominated us for the Signal Awards for Best Buddy, but I don't remember.
[02:36.780 --> 02:39.280]  I must have submitted us to something else a while ago.
[02:39.820 --> 02:39.920]  Okay.
[02:40.120 --> 02:46.400]  But we are nominated for the Best Buddy category, Best Buddy Podcast at the Signal Awards.
[02:46.600 --> 02:49.040]  Well, we can't win, though. They're never going to read out our name.
[02:49.680 --> 02:49.980]  That's-
[02:49.980 --> 02:51.760]  No, that's why we have to win.
[02:52.300 --> 02:56.420]  Andrew just keeps saying we need to be the award-winning f***face podcast.
[02:57.280 --> 02:57.720]  Yeah.
[02:58.340 --> 02:59.040]  Here's the thing.
[02:59.460 --> 03:02.960]  Eric, I f***ing love that you put us in the Buddy category, first of all,
[03:03.260 --> 03:06.520]  because that means that is a flex if we win this award.
[03:07.180 --> 03:11.100]  We haven't even really mentioned on the show we are nominated for a Signal Award in the Best Buddy
[03:11.100 --> 03:15.580]  category. I'm sure there will be links in the show notes. Please vote for us, because I want
[03:15.580 --> 03:20.940]  to be able to flex in every relationship. I have every friendship. If there's an argument,
[03:21.720 --> 03:26.340]  once we win an award for Best Buddies, we've received an award in friendship.
[03:26.420 --> 03:32.300]  How many people have awards in friendship? Any argument you have with anyone, be like,
[03:32.340 --> 03:36.140]  oh, are you an award-winning friend? I don't think so. I think I'm in the right here.
[03:36.360 --> 03:37.140]  Oh, that's a great point.
[03:37.140 --> 03:41.020]  We are going to be award-winning friends. Well, assuming we win.
[03:41.880 --> 03:44.940]  That is like the greatest accolade I could think of.
[03:45.940 --> 03:51.080]  There's layers to this. One, there is an award ceremony in January. So if we win,
[03:51.160 --> 03:55.180]  just the concept of somebody at an award show having to say f***face is very funny.
[03:55.980 --> 03:57.340]  Are you going to be there to accept?
[03:57.800 --> 04:00.980]  Well, you know, I just came back from Austin, so I got to look and make sure maybe you have
[04:00.980 --> 04:04.460]  some travel miles built up. I could get a discount. We'll find out. I'll have to look
[04:04.460 --> 04:11.920]  into that. But also to just be an award-winning f***face is so stupid. It's so dumb. I love it.
[04:12.360 --> 04:16.920]  It'd be amazing. It would mean so much to us. I generally don't like speaking beyond myself,
[04:16.920 --> 04:19.100]  but I think we can all agree it would be amazing to have.
[04:19.300 --> 04:20.000]  Don't speak for me.
[04:20.200 --> 04:20.920]  Love to win this.
[04:21.440 --> 04:22.200]  How dare you?
[04:22.800 --> 04:25.040]  So what? People can vote? Is that what?
[04:25.140 --> 04:28.780]  Yeah, I think so. It's a public... I feel like I covered that, but...
[04:29.980 --> 04:31.820]  What do you like to call to action?
[04:32.580 --> 04:36.160]  Well, no, we haven't recorded. I think I'm going to do that after this,
[04:36.280 --> 04:39.500]  maybe to throw on the start of the next episode. At this current moment,
[04:39.540 --> 04:42.760]  we have 81% of the vote, so I feel pretty good about it.
[04:42.780 --> 04:46.020]  It's such a weird concept. It's just everyone asking their audience just to vote.
[04:46.420 --> 04:51.560]  It's basically like who has more... Whose audience has more free time?
[04:52.640 --> 04:56.220]  Well, it's also... It's a strange thing, too, because I don't think...
[04:56.220 --> 05:00.760]  I think there's some bigger shows in the category, so we'd need a larger percentage.
[05:01.140 --> 05:05.240]  And also, there is a former... What was John Kasich, Geoff? Is he a governor?
[05:05.800 --> 05:08.180]  He was a... John Kasich was a governor, I believe.
[05:08.400 --> 05:10.060]  Yeah, he was the governor of Ohio, right?
[05:10.360 --> 05:13.520]  Maybe. He's a Republican governor, I believe.
[05:13.940 --> 05:14.640]  Doesn't really matter.
[05:14.700 --> 05:15.760]  Governor of Ohio.
[05:16.220 --> 05:16.380]  Yeah.
[05:16.580 --> 05:21.740]  Yeah. So we're up against a podcast, Gavin, in the buddy category that is from a former...
[05:21.740 --> 05:24.020]  He's familiar with getting people to vote.
[05:24.180 --> 05:25.380]  We got some competition.
[05:26.360 --> 05:30.440]  I always feel so weird trying to get people to vote, but this would be so funny.
[05:30.440 --> 05:32.400]  Oh, it's... Yeah, it would be hilarious.
[05:32.700 --> 05:36.900]  But I feel like it's important to point out that at the end of the day,
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.100]  it's an honor just to be nominated.
[05:39.620 --> 05:41.240]  Which we did ourselves, apparently.
[05:42.600 --> 05:46.780]  Yeah, actually, in this case, it is, because it's the best buddy award or whatever.
[05:46.800 --> 05:50.360]  I don't remember the specific wording, but to be nominated is pretty good as well.
[05:50.880 --> 05:54.140]  That's also a flex. I was nominated for a friendship award.
[05:54.440 --> 05:57.140]  Doesn't quite have the weight of winning one, but it's something.
[05:57.460 --> 05:58.580]  We get a little mileage out of that.
[05:59.060 --> 06:01.700]  So is this specifically our three-way buddy ship?
[06:01.880 --> 06:04.400]  Or is there a group of two within the three?
[06:04.640 --> 06:05.840]  Or the five, I guess.
[06:05.960 --> 06:06.260]  No, no.
[06:06.660 --> 06:07.340]  The head of the game.
[06:08.060 --> 06:09.700]  No, it's the five-way buddy ship is what it is.
[06:09.700 --> 06:10.320]  The five-way buddy ship.
[06:10.840 --> 06:12.600]  Yeah, it's a full... We got a full ship.
[06:13.180 --> 06:15.420]  It's a full ship. It's like Noah's Ark of comedy.
[06:15.740 --> 06:16.580]  Yeah, and friendship.
[06:20.080 --> 06:23.860]  If you were an animal in Noah's Ark, what animal would you choose to be?
[06:25.140 --> 06:25.760]  A fish.
[06:26.820 --> 06:28.060]  Yeah. Oh, they're sneaky.
[06:28.480 --> 06:32.400]  Yeah, I think I would be... I think I'd be a dolphin.
[06:32.980 --> 06:36.000]  I'd be something that could get the fuck off that boat and wouldn't drown.
[06:36.420 --> 06:40.440]  So did he take the fish on the boat or did he just hope that they'd be fine not getting washed away?
[06:41.100 --> 06:43.220]  I don't know. That's a great question.
[06:45.840 --> 06:47.140]  I think I'd be a llama.
[06:47.760 --> 06:49.260]  I don't know what the fuck with llamas.
[06:50.480 --> 06:54.420]  Yeah, like I feel like whenever I see them in like open ranges of grass,
[06:54.520 --> 06:56.560]  they're just kind of hanging out, they're walking around.
[06:56.900 --> 07:00.000]  It seems like a pretty low-key, not stressful life.
[07:00.400 --> 07:04.760]  Nobody's hunting you for your meat, at least not in like a general sense.
[07:05.100 --> 07:05.520]  I've never been to a grocery store with a llama.
[07:05.520 --> 07:08.220]  Yeah, but I don't think there's hunting taking place on the Ark.
[07:08.460 --> 07:11.440]  I think Noah's got all that settled down. He's fed everyone.
[07:11.440 --> 07:13.720]  The Ark is just for a time, Gavin.
[07:13.780 --> 07:17.240]  We're eventually going to return to the land and live for life.
[07:17.540 --> 07:19.860]  So the question is, what animal do you want to be?
[07:20.500 --> 07:21.480]  I guess, yeah.
[07:22.820 --> 07:26.000]  There was an uneasy truce for 40 days and 40 nights.
[07:26.420 --> 07:30.940]  And the second they got off that boat, the lion turned around and was like, you're fucked.
[07:31.620 --> 07:32.420]  That's a great point.
[07:32.580 --> 07:35.360]  But if there is a mutiny, nobody's coming for the llama first.
[07:35.800 --> 07:37.540]  That's going to be a mid-pack animal.
[07:38.340 --> 07:39.220]  They're going to eat Gavin.
[07:39.300 --> 07:40.740]  They're going to eat your ass first.
[07:40.740 --> 07:43.500]  You're going to be grilled up immediately in a food shortage.
[07:43.560 --> 07:44.320]  You're delicious.
[07:47.160 --> 07:47.920]  Grilled up.
[07:48.480 --> 07:52.060]  You know, if you think about it from a literal standpoint, that Noah dude,
[07:52.280 --> 07:57.100]  according to the Bible or whatnot, he took a boy and a girl animal
[07:57.960 --> 08:01.460]  from every species on Earth and put them on a boat together, right?
[08:02.940 --> 08:05.460]  A, nobody talks about what that smell would have been like.
[08:05.580 --> 08:06.420]  I can't imagine.
[08:07.320 --> 08:09.280]  It's been a couple seconds just thinking about that.
[08:09.280 --> 08:14.060]  But B, can you imagine how pissed off that Noah dude would be now if he's like,
[08:14.280 --> 08:17.840]  why did I save all these animals if you're going to let most of them go extinct?
[08:20.600 --> 08:22.500]  You imagine if it was like a fairy?
[08:23.000 --> 08:23.420]  A fairy?
[08:23.540 --> 08:27.200]  I'm just, yeah, like, well, because there's countless animals.
[08:27.580 --> 08:28.620]  There's so many animals.
[08:29.060 --> 08:32.360]  And Geoff brought up the point, one of each, the idea was that they would repopulate.
[08:32.520 --> 08:33.700]  The whole story is absurd.
[08:34.080 --> 08:38.460]  Could you imagine taking a boat somewhere and there are thousands of animals simultaneously
[08:38.460 --> 08:40.560]  fucking while you're just trying to get somewhere?
[08:41.220 --> 08:41.600]  Terrible.
[08:41.700 --> 08:42.880]  This is an awful experience.
[08:43.000 --> 08:46.380]  It sounds like a terrible, well, how, like, how did Noah keep his sanity?
[08:46.780 --> 08:48.220]  And the concept that this is real?
[08:48.280 --> 08:50.260]  How long does it take rabbits to reproduce?
[08:52.120 --> 08:54.300]  Oh, I've always thought Noah was a mug.
[08:54.760 --> 08:56.760]  He, he, he looked at the problem all wrong.
[08:56.860 --> 08:58.500]  He took full sized animals.
[08:59.380 --> 09:01.100]  He took fully grown animals.
[09:01.340 --> 09:06.780]  If he'd taken babies, male and female, each baby, he would have saved so much space.
[09:06.780 --> 09:08.240]  And he probably wouldn't have to deal with an ark.
[09:08.460 --> 09:10.840]  Yeah, but then they wouldn't have their grown up,
[09:10.840 --> 09:13.560]  grown up animal counterparts to teach them the ways of being.
[09:13.560 --> 09:14.360]  It's all instinct.
[09:14.660 --> 09:14.980]  It's instinct.
[09:15.280 --> 09:21.160]  I will say, I checked that the gestation period for rabbits is 29 to 35 days.
[09:21.460 --> 09:23.220]  So they may have started with two rabbits,
[09:23.340 --> 09:25.660]  but I guarantee you they didn't end with two on that boat.
[09:25.740 --> 09:26.520]  Oh, absolutely.
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.480]  Do you think once a week Noah had to just pop in and drown?
[09:30.820 --> 09:32.900]  Maybe rabbits were the food they all ate.
[09:34.740 --> 09:37.280]  He's like, as long as there's two left, we get off the boat, we're fine.
[09:38.460 --> 09:42.860]  The idea that it becomes like a prison like gang war of like space,
[09:43.100 --> 09:47.060]  of like each animals had to make their different groups and clans and
[09:47.060 --> 09:48.780]  fend off for themselves to the boat.
[09:48.980 --> 09:49.640]  It sounds terrible.
[09:49.800 --> 09:52.660]  This sounds like you know all the stuff that's all the animals are going to be
[09:52.660 --> 09:56.820]  excited to get off, like the lions and the tigers and all that stuff.
[09:57.180 --> 09:59.680]  And there's a bunch of shit that's just not going to want to get off the boat.
[10:00.380 --> 10:01.660]  Yeah, absolutely.
[10:01.900 --> 10:04.820]  Certainly not with the tiger on shore waiting for me to get off.
[10:05.240 --> 10:05.840]  Yeah, yeah.
[10:06.000 --> 10:07.740]  What about dogs?
[10:07.740 --> 10:10.300]  Did they have two of every kind of dog?
[10:11.080 --> 10:13.920]  Well, I don't think a lot of them have been bred yet in biblical times.
[10:14.400 --> 10:15.520]  Certainly some of them must have been.
[10:15.840 --> 10:19.520]  I feel confident saying we're the first group of people that have pivoted from
[10:19.520 --> 10:21.600]  John Kasich to Noah's Ark material.
[10:21.980 --> 10:22.700]  What a transition.
[10:22.920 --> 10:23.840]  I don't know how we got here.
[10:24.040 --> 10:25.280]  How did we get to Noah's Ark?
[10:25.400 --> 10:27.920]  Did you guys know that Noah's Ark is supposedly,
[10:28.220 --> 10:32.620]  has supposedly been found and it's on some mountain in Russia and Siberia somewhere?
[10:33.000 --> 10:34.080]  No, I didn't know.
[10:34.560 --> 10:37.160]  I remember reading about that one like 20 years ago,
[10:37.260 --> 10:39.400]  but they think they found it and it was in like some...
[10:39.400 --> 10:40.280]  I feel like...
[10:40.280 --> 10:40.720]  Was he drunk?
[10:41.020 --> 10:41.460]  Siberia.
[10:41.680 --> 10:43.180]  Yeah, he crashed it.
[10:43.240 --> 10:44.100]  He crashed it on a mountain.
[10:47.540 --> 10:48.460]  Hey, you know what?
[10:48.680 --> 10:49.240]  What's that, buddy?
[10:49.240 --> 10:49.460]  What?
[10:50.060 --> 10:50.940]  You know what's phenomenal?
[10:51.760 --> 10:52.440]  What's phenomenal?
[10:53.580 --> 10:54.020]  Oh!
[10:54.320 --> 10:59.340]  You got the foot, the Vancouver child kicker keyboard pad thing.
[10:59.440 --> 10:59.720]  House.
[11:00.020 --> 11:00.880]  You could live in that thing.
[11:01.560 --> 11:01.960]  You could.
[11:01.960 --> 11:03.920]  It works an absolute treat.
[11:05.260 --> 11:08.480]  It's definitely lower quality than my previous mouse mat.
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.240]  The edges aren't sort of hemmed in, so they're going to start fraying and it stinks.
[11:14.500 --> 11:17.700]  But other than that, it's really effective.
[11:17.940 --> 11:19.660]  What does it smell like?
[11:19.800 --> 11:22.480]  Yeah, just like gammy rubber.
[11:22.880 --> 11:23.200]  I don't know.
[11:24.700 --> 11:26.820]  I couldn't figure out which way was best to have it.
[11:27.540 --> 11:29.320]  I had it both ways, but this...
[11:30.240 --> 11:33.680]  having it pointed to the left gave me more mouse room.
[11:34.020 --> 11:37.980]  So I thought that's going to be the way, even though it leaves you a bit of a gap towards you.
[11:37.980 --> 11:39.580]  Yeah, it looks good.
[11:39.920 --> 11:43.140]  So do you sign off on this as a product we could sell?
[11:43.660 --> 11:45.220]  Yeah, but I do think we should do it properly.
[11:45.600 --> 11:47.360]  Okay, yeah, yeah, like make it well.
[11:48.060 --> 11:53.060]  Did we ever discuss like how the fuck this happened and why we have it in the first place?
[11:53.520 --> 11:54.260]  I don't think so.
[11:54.700 --> 11:55.580]  The last episode, I think.
[11:56.280 --> 11:56.620]  Didn't we?
[11:56.700 --> 11:57.760]  I got two radically different answers.
[11:57.760 --> 11:59.620]  Yeah, we had completely different responses.
[11:59.780 --> 12:00.720]  I don't think we...
[12:00.720 --> 12:04.540]  Yeah, we talked about how Tony was sending us the rug samples.
[12:05.420 --> 12:10.280]  Oh, and they made like a giant rug out of mousepad material.
[12:10.500 --> 12:12.600]  Like, I don't think this was intended to be a mousepad, right?
[12:12.680 --> 12:12.900]  No.
[12:13.140 --> 12:13.320]  Yeah.
[12:13.800 --> 12:14.460]  Absolutely not.
[12:14.580 --> 12:15.580]  No, it wasn't something we ordered.
[12:15.680 --> 12:16.280]  They just sent it.
[12:16.420 --> 12:21.140]  But the fucking... one look at it and I can tell you that it's a fucking winner.
[12:22.560 --> 12:25.660]  Yeah, it's not perfect, but you know, it's an accident.
[12:28.860 --> 12:31.100]  What size shoe do you think that would be?
[12:31.540 --> 12:31.980]  60.
[12:34.360 --> 12:38.200]  Yeah, it's a size 60.
[12:38.520 --> 12:38.900]  For sure.
[12:40.000 --> 12:40.720]  That's funny.
[12:41.220 --> 12:43.380]  What was the fake number that I made up?
[12:43.460 --> 12:43.920]  It's that many.
[12:44.720 --> 12:45.980]  67, right?
[12:46.160 --> 12:46.480]  Was it that?
[12:46.480 --> 12:49.040]  Oh my god, I almost said it out loud when you asked.
[12:50.660 --> 12:53.500]  I caught myself, I caught myself, but I almost said it.
[12:54.200 --> 12:55.340]  That would have been great.
[12:56.240 --> 13:01.960]  If you... I don't know when office material is going to come out in relation to this,
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.300]  so I don't know if you should mention what that is.
[13:04.920 --> 13:05.300]  Yeah, it'll come up.
[13:05.320 --> 13:05.680]  What do you mean?
[13:06.960 --> 13:08.480]  Was that in the best of 2022?
[13:09.700 --> 13:10.360]  Yeah, it was.
[13:10.560 --> 13:16.420]  We did a best of 2022, which we did our fall draft, which, you know, bumpy start,
[13:16.540 --> 13:18.280]  but I think overall went very well.
[13:18.380 --> 13:19.300]  I thought it went very smooth.
[13:19.580 --> 13:21.220]  I don't know what bumps you're talking about.
[13:21.840 --> 13:22.940]  We figured it out.
[13:23.020 --> 13:28.080]  We had a little bit of confusion somehow at the start of the process, but we worked through it.
[13:28.340 --> 13:32.280]  I will say, I think you should probably for like people excited about that,
[13:32.700 --> 13:35.640]  expect to experience it almost like a watch along.
[13:35.760 --> 13:39.580]  I would say like the MVP2 thing or what was the other one?
[13:39.620 --> 13:40.300]  The tuxedo.
[13:41.420 --> 13:43.460]  It's a lot of us reacting to clips,
[13:43.480 --> 13:47.820]  and I'm sure we'll compile them in some way for people to watch along as well.
[13:51.400 --> 13:55.020]  Gavin posted the picture of a very disgruntled Eric.
[13:55.080 --> 13:55.900]  He was having a rough day.
[13:56.340 --> 13:57.500]  I had to stop and take a picture.
[13:57.820 --> 14:03.220]  He was like panting and his hair was all over the place and he looked a little bit clammy.
[14:03.340 --> 14:06.460]  I think that might have been one of the worst days of Eric's year.
[14:07.060 --> 14:08.340]  It was not good.
[14:08.820 --> 14:10.500]  That was exceptionally bad.
[14:10.540 --> 14:11.160]  That's funny.
[14:11.300 --> 14:14.480]  I'll say this, I saw him age in the room.
[14:15.140 --> 14:22.400]  I just, everything that came up was already taught, was what I had brought up.
[14:22.720 --> 14:27.240]  And then you guys brought, after agreeing, like going with it with Andrew,
[14:27.460 --> 14:30.200]  getting in the room and then going, I don't know what's happening.
[14:30.580 --> 14:32.940]  And it's like, I don't, I don't know what else I can do.
[14:33.220 --> 14:35.680]  Like, a man has a limit.
[14:36.360 --> 14:41.560]  Are you saying that you don't like it when stuff gets brought up and then nothing happens?
[14:42.640 --> 14:45.280]  I'm saying that I brought it up.
[14:45.300 --> 14:46.500]  And I know what you're driving at.
[14:46.560 --> 14:47.360]  I'm not going there.
[14:47.680 --> 14:51.540]  I am saying that I brought it up.
[14:51.680 --> 14:55.160]  Everyone was fine and told me I was wrong when I brought it up.
[14:55.180 --> 15:02.260]  And then when it was go time, everyone for, for 40 minutes went, I don't know, what are we?
[15:02.380 --> 15:03.800]  So hang on, what's the pool?
[15:04.340 --> 15:05.500]  Fuck, fuck.
[15:05.760 --> 15:09.000]  Can you by any chance see the most recent episode of Regulation Animation?
[15:09.680 --> 15:11.760]  Uh, was that the bicycle one?
[15:12.300 --> 15:12.500]  Yep.
[15:13.280 --> 15:13.680]  Yeah.
[15:14.560 --> 15:15.600]  What do you think of the end?
[15:18.160 --> 15:19.540]  They didn't bleep it again.
[15:19.680 --> 15:20.380]  Do you love it?
[15:21.360 --> 15:23.740]  No, they did not bleep it.
[15:23.980 --> 15:24.120]  Yeah.
[15:24.880 --> 15:28.540]  Are you, uh, are you, are you feeling pretty good about it too?
[15:29.560 --> 15:32.660]  Are you the one who gets to message people and go, hey, what happened?
[15:32.860 --> 15:34.620]  Do we have to have a meeting about this?
[15:34.760 --> 15:35.800]  Or is that you?
[15:35.960 --> 15:37.220]  Or no, it's me.
[15:37.380 --> 15:37.620]  Great.
[15:37.740 --> 15:38.780]  Yeah, no, I love it.
[15:39.420 --> 15:40.940]  Yeah, no, exceptional.
[15:41.720 --> 15:42.440]  Oh, shit.
[15:42.580 --> 15:49.300]  It's time for, uh, God, we, we should mention, by the way, uh, these regulation animations
[15:49.300 --> 15:50.320]  are coming out every week.
[15:50.420 --> 15:52.980]  Are they on YouTube or just on the RT site?
[15:53.080 --> 15:53.300]  They are.
[15:53.320 --> 15:56.960]  So they're on YouTube and on Face YouTube channel and the Rooster Teeth site.
[15:57.080 --> 16:00.800]  I think there's probably three or four of them out by the time, maybe five by the time
[16:00.800 --> 16:02.040]  that this airs.
[16:02.040 --> 16:03.600]  And they're just delightful.
[16:04.020 --> 16:04.760]  I love them.
[16:05.020 --> 16:05.880]  I think they're so funny.
[16:05.880 --> 16:09.880]  The, uh, things they've added through the animation, I think.
[16:09.940 --> 16:10.640]  Oh, yeah, that's phenomenal.
[16:10.860 --> 16:12.380]  Provides so much to the stories.
[16:12.560 --> 16:13.600]  The ending could be better, but.
[16:15.520 --> 16:18.440]  I agree with you 100% on the same page with you, Gavin.
[16:18.820 --> 16:19.180]  Absolutely.
[16:19.760 --> 16:21.000]  Why don't we just get rid of it in general?
[16:21.100 --> 16:23.640]  I don't think we even need that part or at least do a different one every time.
[16:23.820 --> 16:24.440]  It's the same.
[16:24.560 --> 16:25.680]  It's the same one.
[16:25.860 --> 16:26.320]  Oh, Gavin.
[16:27.420 --> 16:31.840]  These conversations that I've had regarding this specifically, I agree with you.
[16:32.520 --> 16:32.860]  I agree.
[16:33.080 --> 16:34.960]  You know, make them fresh then if we got to have them.
[16:35.760 --> 16:37.580]  Are you, you want to record one?
[16:39.520 --> 16:42.200]  What, just a thing saying, uh, check out the episode it came from?
[16:42.240 --> 16:42.420]  Yeah.
[16:42.880 --> 16:43.200]  Okay.
[16:44.020 --> 16:44.480]  All right.
[16:44.580 --> 16:47.860]  We should all record one and then that'll, that'll keep it fresh.
[16:48.400 --> 16:51.400]  I'll see if the next one is bleeped and then, uh, then I'll go ahead and do it.
[16:51.740 --> 16:54.180]  Oh, I'll see if the next one is bleeped and jump out a window.
[16:57.200 --> 16:59.320]  At this point, I hope it's never bleeped.
[16:59.880 --> 17:01.400]  Eric lives in a one story house.
[17:01.500 --> 17:02.460]  He's not going to fall for it.
[17:03.020 --> 17:03.340]  Right.
[17:03.360 --> 17:04.620]  It's just going to hurt a little bit.
[17:06.160 --> 17:07.220]  Yeah, my ankle.
[17:07.740 --> 17:09.260]  I'm at 92% now.
[17:11.440 --> 17:14.960]  Uh, I will say if you're on the fence about whether to watch these or not, I don't know
[17:14.960 --> 17:16.260]  why you would be just fucking watch them.
[17:16.340 --> 17:20.720]  They're awesome and they're short, but I, the thing I like about them is that they provide
[17:20.720 --> 17:24.360]  little summaries of, uh, deep lore about the show.
[17:24.460 --> 17:28.740]  Like if you ever want to know where the Vancouver child kicker came from, uh, and you don't
[17:28.740 --> 17:32.140]  want to go back and listen a hundred episodes back, it's in there and it's in like a three
[17:32.140 --> 17:33.140]  minute digestible format.
[17:33.140 --> 17:39.120]  Go, go now is cut down to four minutes from an hour and, uh, and they did a pretty good
[17:39.120 --> 17:40.200]  fucking job with it, right?
[17:40.480 --> 17:40.600]  Yeah.
[17:40.840 --> 17:42.620]  Uh, the bicycle store, all that stuff.
[17:42.680 --> 17:47.080]  It's like, it's a great little, like, uh, it's a great little primer for old jokes or,
[17:47.080 --> 17:48.900]  or existing jokes and where they began.
[17:49.220 --> 17:49.900]  They're fantastic.
[17:50.340 --> 17:54.280]  Gavin, I thought you were going a very different direction with that, which is why I said,
[17:54.620 --> 17:55.120]  oh no.
[17:55.320 --> 17:56.020]  What'd you think I was doing?
[17:56.780 --> 18:00.820]  I thought you were, you're bringing up, uh, things that said they would be done, but haven't
[18:00.820 --> 18:01.580]  been completed yet.
[18:01.580 --> 18:04.000]  The icy hot issue that is still lingering.
[18:04.240 --> 18:06.600]  Oh, since the office day.
[18:06.820 --> 18:10.040]  That's going to happen today because Eric agreed.
[18:10.180 --> 18:11.760]  We took a, you guys made a separate video.
[18:12.120 --> 18:14.260]  Eric was pretty adamant that he wasn't avoiding it.
[18:14.340 --> 18:15.620]  He just didn't have the icy hot.
[18:16.000 --> 18:21.460]  But, uh, in, in, in that little, uh, thing that we recorded, I put it in his hand.
[18:21.680 --> 18:22.640]  So are we doing it now?
[18:22.700 --> 18:24.260]  Are we going to have it with me right now?
[18:24.300 --> 18:25.180]  Are we all doing it?
[18:26.160 --> 18:26.840]  I mean, yeah.
[18:27.360 --> 18:28.200]  If we're all going to do it.
[18:28.300 --> 18:31.480]  I, oh, by the way, uh, can I just say, I don't know how y'all
[18:31.480 --> 18:35.080]  feel about it, but I think these office days are a real home run.
[18:35.580 --> 18:38.300]  I we're making some of the best fucking stuff in these office days.
[18:38.380 --> 18:43.060]  We made three videos this week in office day that I think are all going to be just delightful.
[18:43.600 --> 18:44.500]  That's so good.
[18:44.580 --> 18:45.320]  And that's so productive.
[18:45.500 --> 18:49.180]  And there's just a weird element that's caused by Andrew not being there.
[18:49.440 --> 18:57.700]  When Eric is mad at Geoff or myself, he'll, he'll like look at us and like aim the madness at us.
[18:57.700 --> 18:59.700]  When Andrew, he's mad at Andrew.
[18:59.940 --> 19:04.200]  He just has to blankly like aim all over the room to the point where he's just staring at Nick.
[19:05.760 --> 19:08.740]  And Nick's like, you're looking at me, but you're yelling at Andrew.
[19:09.400 --> 19:13.180]  Nick is right in front of me, like in my eyeline.
[19:13.260 --> 19:16.300]  And I'm just yelling at Nick.
[19:16.880 --> 19:21.240]  Nick has to like lean back almost, but it's Andrew taking all the front.
[19:24.600 --> 19:25.400]  God damn.
[19:25.760 --> 19:26.460]  So are we doing this?
[19:26.460 --> 19:27.700]  You guys have your Icy Hot?
[19:28.020 --> 19:29.020]  Yeah, I do. I'm ready.
[19:30.500 --> 19:31.500]  I'm never doing this.
[19:31.640 --> 19:32.920]  This is the end of Icy Hot in this show.
[19:33.060 --> 19:35.140]  Yeah, this is it. We're done. This is the end of this bit.
[19:35.660 --> 19:37.760]  I said I would never do this again and here I am doing it.
[19:38.860 --> 19:39.980]  One, two, three, go or?
[19:40.460 --> 19:40.780]  Here.
[19:41.060 --> 19:45.520]  I've turned on my camera because I think that there's this thing where I'm trying to avoid this.
[19:45.600 --> 19:46.600]  I just didn't have it.
[19:47.220 --> 19:47.920]  I believe you.
[19:48.420 --> 19:49.120]  I believe you.
[19:49.220 --> 19:49.660]  It's here.
[19:50.020 --> 19:51.200]  Let me full screen on this.
[19:54.640 --> 19:56.020]  That's about how much I have.
[19:56.500 --> 19:56.820]  Okay.
[19:57.040 --> 19:57.600]  All right, here we go.
[19:57.680 --> 19:57.720]  Okay.
[19:58.120 --> 19:58.900]  On the balls.
[19:59.980 --> 20:01.380]  He's scrunching up his face.
[20:04.760 --> 20:06.180]  Don't step too far back, Garrett.
[20:06.300 --> 20:07.700]  Ah, put it on my dickhead.
[20:08.900 --> 20:09.880]  That's going to suck.
[20:10.100 --> 20:10.240]  Okay.
[20:11.500 --> 20:12.020]  I'm okay.
[20:13.920 --> 20:14.920]  It's a little menthol-y.
[20:15.600 --> 20:16.460]  It's a little menthol-y.
[20:16.780 --> 20:19.340]  I also don't think anyone else is doing this. I don't believe any of you.
[20:21.840 --> 20:22.660]  Here's my camera.
[20:24.740 --> 20:25.480]  I should get...
[20:25.480 --> 20:25.920]  Here's my...
[20:25.920 --> 20:27.540]  Here's my fucking Icy Hot.
[20:27.540 --> 20:28.740]  Right on my dickhole.
[20:28.960 --> 20:29.800]  Right on my peehole.
[20:30.180 --> 20:31.100]  And my left nut.
[20:31.520 --> 20:34.500]  I'm staying off the right side today because of...
[20:35.020 --> 20:35.340]  I don't know.
[20:35.380 --> 20:37.320]  That's just where all the fucking gammy...
[20:37.320 --> 20:37.700]  Oh no!
[20:37.880 --> 20:38.420]  Crotch rot was.
[20:38.440 --> 20:39.480]  Oh, it sucks.
[20:41.140 --> 20:41.580]  Oh!
[20:42.220 --> 20:42.660]  Ooh.
[20:43.180 --> 20:43.540]  Ah!
[20:44.820 --> 20:45.920]  Oh, god damn it.
[20:46.200 --> 20:46.540]  Oh!
[20:48.020 --> 20:50.680]  It's like smoking Kool's but out of your dick.
[20:56.640 --> 20:57.520]  I hate...
[20:58.120 --> 21:01.380]  Like it burns in a wave and it gets worse and worse and then it's...
[21:01.380 --> 21:01.700]  You know...
[21:01.700 --> 21:03.140]  You know what the worst part about this is?
[21:03.880 --> 21:04.460]  And then it goes up again.
[21:04.460 --> 21:04.980]  Now that I have...
[21:04.980 --> 21:06.700]  Now that I have the Gerpler...
[21:06.700 --> 21:09.760]  I just want to put my balls in it right now because it's so big.
[21:10.340 --> 21:12.940]  Well, if you're gonna put your balls in the Gerpler, turn your camera on.
[21:14.480 --> 21:15.200]  Oh, god.
[21:16.200 --> 21:16.740]  Man, my dick hurts.
[21:16.740 --> 21:17.600]  Oh, this is terrible.
[21:20.060 --> 21:20.420]  Fuck.
[21:20.940 --> 21:22.300]  Why did I bring this up?
[21:23.040 --> 21:24.240]  Why did I do this?
[21:24.800 --> 21:25.080]  Fuck!
[21:25.080 --> 21:29.520]  I hope to god this is the last time we ever...
[21:29.520 --> 21:29.880]  This is!
[21:30.280 --> 21:30.940]  Never again.
[21:31.460 --> 21:32.000]  Ever do this.
[21:32.000 --> 21:32.380]  Never again.
[21:33.380 --> 21:34.260]  Never again.
[21:35.260 --> 21:36.340]  Eric's headphones are off.
[21:38.200 --> 21:40.120]  It's now a good time to mention I didn't do it.
[21:41.260 --> 21:42.840]  I can still hear you, dipshit.
[21:43.320 --> 21:44.780]  How can you hear me without the headphones?
[21:44.780 --> 21:46.300]  Of course you didn't fucking do it.
[21:46.660 --> 21:49.280]  So to be honest, Eric, you have my I.C. on.
[21:53.500 --> 21:55.740]  I can use your excuse now.
[21:56.280 --> 21:57.840]  Why did I do it then?
[21:58.560 --> 21:59.560]  God damn it.
[21:59.820 --> 22:02.680]  Geoff, you were gonna do it when we weren't even doing an episode.
[22:03.380 --> 22:04.900]  Well, yeah, I'm always down.
[22:05.380 --> 22:06.240]  I'm always down for stuff.
[22:06.740 --> 22:08.000]  How can you hear me without headphones?
[22:09.060 --> 22:13.300]  I was part of the plan and agreed to not do it, but then I felt bad, so I did it.
[22:13.480 --> 22:13.880]  Fuck!
[22:14.860 --> 22:17.220]  You're the only one not doing it right now, Gavin.
[22:17.220 --> 22:21.210]  The cold is such a relief, but the hot, like...
[22:22.140 --> 22:23.280]  Isn't it so bad?
[22:23.460 --> 22:24.940]  It's so much worse than you think.
[22:25.380 --> 22:30.280]  It's weird how much I can feel my left ball, but not my right ball at all.
[22:30.820 --> 22:33.320]  It's weird to be hyper aware of one ball.
[22:38.050 --> 22:40.090]  Oh, Nick said something interesting.
[22:40.490 --> 22:43.730]  Nick said I didn't do it because I had an I.C. hot incident earlier today.
[22:44.050 --> 22:44.950]  What does that mean?
[22:46.210 --> 22:52.510]  Uh, so I had some back pain and I had my wife put one of those giant XL patches on my back
[22:52.510 --> 22:56.890]  and then, uh, I forgot, I took it off and I forgot about it and I took a shower
[22:56.890 --> 23:04.390]  and, uh, was using a washcloth on said area and then, uh, proceeded to use it south of the border.
[23:05.210 --> 23:06.970]  Oh shit, you, you moved it.
[23:07.470 --> 23:08.130]  I did.
[23:08.130 --> 23:08.990]  You moved the effect.
[23:09.370 --> 23:12.530]  Yep, directly, well, basically I needed a spicy I.C.
[23:12.970 --> 23:14.070]  Two spicy O's.
[23:15.810 --> 23:19.190]  So you did do it today, Nick, you just did it in a slightly more hardcore way.
[23:19.210 --> 23:22.350]  Yeah, I just, I just went around back, that's all.
[23:24.450 --> 23:26.710]  Oh, this is sucks, this sucks.
[23:27.010 --> 23:28.330]  Yeah, yeah.
[23:28.790 --> 23:31.130]  Are you, uh, what are you doing to alleviate, Eric?
[23:31.190 --> 23:32.090]  Are you just writing it out?
[23:32.170 --> 23:33.750]  Are you, uh, dunking in the Gerpler?
[23:33.870 --> 23:35.370]  Are you airing it out by a window?
[23:35.510 --> 23:38.410]  I'm just, okay, oh, I'm, I'm airing it out.
[23:39.490 --> 23:43.590]  I mean, I'm, I'm at a standing desk.
[23:44.870 --> 23:50.590]  I just thought Eric's shorts are off and he just showed me his thigh.
[23:53.170 --> 23:54.190]  It is.
[23:54.810 --> 23:56.410]  Oh, I'm trying.
[23:56.470 --> 23:59.770]  It's like, you know, like a pinch and roll kind of situation.
[23:59.910 --> 24:05.410]  I'm just doing that like nonstop because it feels like that at least almost distracts from.
[24:06.430 --> 24:06.970]  Oh.
[24:08.870 --> 24:10.090]  Oh, that sucks.
[24:11.330 --> 24:12.730]  You're taking it pretty well, I think.
[24:14.130 --> 24:18.630]  Oh, it doesn't like you can't, no touch fixes it.
[24:18.830 --> 24:21.090]  Like there's nothing to do that fixes it.
[24:21.230 --> 24:22.890]  It just keeps going.
[24:23.350 --> 24:27.350]  Yeah, it's just, you just, you just ride the wave of discomfort.
[24:28.050 --> 24:30.790]  It really is like smoking menthols.
[24:30.930 --> 24:32.530]  How weird.
[24:32.530 --> 24:37.150]  Now, I realize that only three of us are currently participating,
[24:37.730 --> 24:40.150]  but Nick already did today and we know Gavin did.
[24:40.390 --> 24:41.670]  So can we just have it be it?
[24:41.750 --> 24:45.450]  I know not all five of us did it at the exact same time, but we're done now, right?
[24:45.550 --> 24:47.010]  Like, I don't want to do this ever again.
[24:47.390 --> 24:48.150]  No, never again.
[24:48.650 --> 24:49.970]  I don't want to do it now.
[24:50.550 --> 24:52.570]  Are you glad that we didn't do it at work, Eric?
[24:53.890 --> 24:56.470]  This doesn't make, I was thinking about this yesterday.
[24:56.910 --> 24:59.910]  It still doesn't make any sense to me that what Geoff was going to do.
[25:00.390 --> 25:01.470]  What, what was that?
[25:01.470 --> 25:03.010]  Why was he going to put it on?
[25:03.370 --> 25:04.790]  I thought we were just going to do it right there.
[25:04.850 --> 25:05.950]  Yeah, we were just going to do it.
[25:06.170 --> 25:10.710]  And then we would cut to like an outside broadcast in the middle of the episode.
[25:11.050 --> 25:12.210]  No, but here's the thing, Eric.
[25:12.630 --> 25:14.750]  There is a fear that you would just slip out of this.
[25:14.850 --> 25:16.870]  That you've been avoiding it purposely,
[25:17.370 --> 25:19.510]  dodging the content, and we had you in a trap.
[25:19.970 --> 25:22.110]  And you're generally muted for most of the show.
[25:22.650 --> 25:24.350]  I thought we fucked up when you're like,
[25:24.470 --> 25:26.910]  nah, nah, we'll do it in an episode so they can hear the reaction.
[25:27.230 --> 25:29.850]  Your reaction is muted most of the time.
[25:29.850 --> 25:31.710]  I was like, we're fucking idiots.
[25:31.870 --> 25:33.190]  We just let him get away with this.
[25:33.270 --> 25:34.390]  But no, you're honorable.
[25:34.690 --> 25:35.370]  I'll give you the credit.
[25:35.650 --> 25:37.930]  Well, yeah, I just didn't do it before because I didn't have it.
[25:37.990 --> 25:39.430]  Again, I wasn't trying to weasel out of this.
[25:39.490 --> 25:40.070]  I just didn't have it.
[25:40.130 --> 25:41.610]  I'm on the hot part now.
[25:42.070 --> 25:43.510]  When does the icy start again?
[25:43.570 --> 25:45.710]  Because I'm back to hot and hot sucks.
[25:46.010 --> 25:48.190]  It's like three minute cycles, I feel like.
[25:48.370 --> 25:49.410]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25:52.250 --> 25:54.270]  Yeah, you're a fucking, you're a champion, Eric.
[25:54.310 --> 25:54.790]  You did it.
[25:54.990 --> 25:57.390]  I'm watching you dance around without your pants on.
[25:58.330 --> 26:00.750]  I'm 100% certain you're not faking that.
[26:01.310 --> 26:05.310]  Watching Eric dance around, I've started copying his movements because I'm like,
[26:05.390 --> 26:06.590]  maybe he knows something.
[26:06.770 --> 26:08.010]  And I'm like, no, he doesn't know anything.
[26:08.210 --> 26:09.590]  We're both stuck in this.
[26:09.990 --> 26:12.730]  It's like, I was trying to copy your leg moves you were doing.
[26:12.810 --> 26:14.030]  I'm like, this isn't helping at all.
[26:14.210 --> 26:15.830]  We're both, there's no help.
[26:16.090 --> 26:16.750]  There's no hope.
[26:16.910 --> 26:17.030]  Yeah.
[26:17.330 --> 26:18.230]  You just got to ride it.
[26:18.510 --> 26:21.010]  Oh, there like really is like no respite from this.
[26:21.390 --> 26:21.550]  This sucks.
[26:21.550 --> 26:23.290]  No, there's no escape.
[26:23.570 --> 26:25.810]  If you're listening to this and you're like, maybe I'll do this.
[26:25.990 --> 26:26.610]  Don't do this.
[26:27.070 --> 26:28.230]  Yeah, don't.
[26:28.230 --> 26:28.630]  It's not fun.
[26:28.810 --> 26:29.270]  Don't do this.
[26:29.310 --> 26:33.250]  So I think the next challenge would be Icy Hot and then the Soda Chug at the same time.
[26:35.850 --> 26:36.930]  Done with Icy Hot.
[26:38.030 --> 26:39.510]  I think you'd just explode.
[26:39.710 --> 26:43.790]  Dude, speaking of Soda Chug, Andrew and I have, we have been talking about,
[26:44.490 --> 26:49.650]  he got his Gerpler and he texted me to tell me he agrees that the speed of Chug,
[26:49.970 --> 26:52.310]  which is, I've decided is a new unit of measurement.
[26:52.310 --> 26:57.310]  The speed of Chug on the Gerpler is that it's like the throttle's wide open.
[26:57.510 --> 26:57.990]  It's insane.
[26:58.270 --> 26:58.390]  Yeah.
[26:58.550 --> 27:01.590]  I listened to what you said, Geoff, and I was like, I guess that kind of makes sense,
[27:01.670 --> 27:03.770]  but I didn't fully believe it to experience it.
[27:04.090 --> 27:07.770]  It's like a whole new world of chugging has opened since using my Gerpler.
[27:07.950 --> 27:11.170]  So if we decanted an entire can of soda into one,
[27:11.310 --> 27:12.590]  are you saying it would go down a lot faster?
[27:13.010 --> 27:14.870]  That's what I, yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
[27:14.990 --> 27:17.670]  I think the Soda Chug would be so much more doable.
[27:18.070 --> 27:19.970]  And do you guys remember the Old Man Show?
[27:19.970 --> 27:21.230]  Not the Doug Stanhope one,
[27:21.310 --> 27:24.930]  but the original one where they had that old dude who would wear the suit and drink a whole,
[27:25.530 --> 27:30.070]  like a whole mug of beer in one go and say ziggy zaggy, ziggy zaggy chug chug.
[27:30.150 --> 27:32.150]  And he was like, he was like, he was famous for it.
[27:32.150 --> 27:33.610]  He could drink all the beer in the world at once.
[27:33.970 --> 27:36.010]  It's like the Gerpler trained you to do that.
[27:36.690 --> 27:37.890]  Ah, yeah, there he is.
[27:38.130 --> 27:39.050]  Oh, that guy.
[27:39.130 --> 27:39.370]  Yeah.
[27:39.470 --> 27:39.870]  Yeah.
[27:39.890 --> 27:41.190]  I forgot about that guy.
[27:41.470 --> 27:42.470]  I've never seen that guy.
[27:42.770 --> 27:44.490]  I think he's dead now, but uh...
[27:44.490 --> 27:45.550]  I would assume he looks dead.
[27:45.890 --> 27:46.690]  A dude can drink beer fast.
[27:46.690 --> 27:47.370]  He looks dead.
[27:47.370 --> 27:52.710]  Well, you can just tell when, like, just by the quality of a picture whether the guy is dead, right?
[27:52.930 --> 27:56.810]  Look at how excited the guy in the bottom left is in that photo.
[27:56.950 --> 28:00.230]  It's age plus resolution equals death.
[28:00.450 --> 28:01.190]  You look for like...
[28:01.850 --> 28:05.690]  You look at resolution and then you look around for mullets and you think that guy's probably dead.
[28:07.930 --> 28:13.130]  That guy in the bottom left looks like Alec Winters in the vampire movie.
[28:13.210 --> 28:13.650]  What's that called?
[28:14.090 --> 28:14.490]  Lost Boys.
[28:19.980 --> 28:22.060]  Have you been naughty or nice this year?
[28:22.520 --> 28:26.840]  I don't know where I'd rank potentially going to Austin and not seeing my friends at all.
[28:26.980 --> 28:27.500]  Would that be naughty?
[28:27.900 --> 28:29.340]  It could be naughty, but it's for a bit.
[28:29.500 --> 28:30.420]  I don't know how to rank that.
[28:30.440 --> 28:34.540]  Anyway, well, you might fool Santa, but you definitely can't fool your internet provider.
[28:35.020 --> 28:37.500]  They've seen all your late night naughty searches this year.
[28:37.620 --> 28:39.180]  That is not the type of naughty I was thinking.
[28:39.280 --> 28:41.400]  I was thinking like a prank, not like the whatever.
[28:41.700 --> 28:42.320]  But you know what?
[28:42.420 --> 28:43.700]  Your business is yours.
[28:43.700 --> 28:48.480]  That's why this holiday season gift yourself the gift of privacy with Express VPN.
[28:49.180 --> 28:49.620]  Guess what?
[28:50.100 --> 28:52.160]  Private mode doesn't keep your activity private.
[28:52.520 --> 28:56.420]  Your internet provider like AT&T or Verizon can see all the websites you've clicked on.
[28:56.680 --> 29:00.960]  They even know how much time you spend on each of them, and they've likely sold it to advertisers.
[29:01.420 --> 29:06.100]  But with Express VPN, all of your traffic gets rerouted through an encrypted server.
[29:06.240 --> 29:09.680]  So all of your browsing activity stays between you and God.
[29:10.060 --> 29:12.140]  Please personalize if not comfortable.
[29:13.400 --> 29:15.780]  Express VPN's app works on all your devices.
[29:16.180 --> 29:20.460]  So whether you're on your phone, tablet, laptop, whatever, you're protected.
[29:20.880 --> 29:23.980]  Best of all, Express VPN is super easy to use.
[29:24.120 --> 29:27.680]  All you have to do is tap one button to turn it on and you're instantly protected.
[29:28.200 --> 29:31.820]  So take yourself off the naughty list with the number one rated VPN.
[29:32.380 --> 29:37.560]  Visit expressvpn.com slash face and get three extra months for free.
[29:37.560 --> 29:46.640]  That's expressvpn.com slash face expressvpn.com slash face.
[29:48.060 --> 29:50.400]  Today's episode is sponsored by PayPal Honey,
[29:50.660 --> 29:53.420]  the easy way to save when shopping on your iPhone or computer.
[29:53.840 --> 29:56.940]  It's the holiday season. You're probably doing a lot of shopping.
[29:57.100 --> 29:59.940]  I personally hate going into the stores this time of year.
[30:00.320 --> 30:03.800]  Everything is so busy and stressful. People are generally miserable. It sucks.
[30:04.080 --> 30:05.280]  I avoid it at all costs.
[30:05.280 --> 30:10.120]  The thing is that when I'm shopping online, I very rarely know what any of the promo codes are.
[30:10.340 --> 30:14.220]  But thanks to Honey, manually searching for coupon codes is a thing of the past.
[30:14.720 --> 30:17.240]  Honey is the free shopping tool that scours the internet for
[30:17.240 --> 30:19.820]  promo codes and applies the best one it finds to your cart.
[30:20.440 --> 30:22.400]  Imagine you're shopping on one of your favorite sites.
[30:22.820 --> 30:26.780]  When you check out, the Honey button appears and all you have to do is click apply coupons.

[30:51.920 --> 30:54.520]  If you don't already have Honey, you could be straight up missing out.

[32:45.700 --> 32:47.700]  Gavin, do you have a lot of stuff in your notes?
[32:47.700 --> 32:51.520]  I got a funny, uh, funny phone call from Geoff after our
[32:52.700 --> 32:53.380]  office day.
[32:55.100 --> 32:57.780]  I wonder, okay, we're going into that. I mean, what happened?
[32:58.240 --> 33:00.500]  It was after the previous recording, wasn't it?
[33:00.500 --> 33:02.300]  It was after the last episode.
[33:02.940 --> 33:03.400]  Okay.
[33:03.640 --> 33:05.480]  Episode 132, I believe.
[33:06.520 --> 33:08.580]  I had, I'll just say this.
[33:09.200 --> 33:14.400]  That episode did my head in a little bit, and I got pretty demoralized.
[33:14.400 --> 33:19.120]  And I, I, I drove to the grocery store and I sat in the parking lot to just try to kind of
[33:19.120 --> 33:23.140]  figure out the process of what happened.
[33:23.360 --> 33:28.360]  Andrew and Eric, what do you think, what do you think happened in the episode he's referencing?
[33:28.920 --> 33:31.520]  The one, the one where I left early?
[33:32.300 --> 33:32.500]  Yep.
[33:32.980 --> 33:33.240]  Yeah.
[33:33.820 --> 33:34.260]  Huh.
[33:35.540 --> 33:38.380]  I can't think of what would have fucked you up.
[33:38.740 --> 33:41.020]  Like, oh my God, the piss smell.
[33:41.260 --> 33:42.100]  Like, I don't know.
[33:42.400 --> 33:43.800]  You went a lot about piss.
[33:44.460 --> 33:48.860]  My brain 100% broke in that episode.
[33:49.820 --> 33:50.540]  What happened?
[33:51.860 --> 33:54.420]  I was telling you guys, uh, I was hyping up a big story.
[33:54.560 --> 33:56.260]  This is, this is, this is in my notes for today.
[33:56.340 --> 33:56.980]  It's called admission.
[33:57.360 --> 34:00.560]  And that's why I called Gavin and I said, I need, I need, I'll say it like I said to Gavin.
[34:00.680 --> 34:03.620]  I need to be honest with you guys about something that just happened
[34:03.620 --> 34:06.340]  in the recording we did in episode 132.
[34:07.260 --> 34:10.920]  Uh, I was telling you guys some, some wacky McDonald's facts
[34:10.920 --> 34:14.520]  that I learned from Emily who was reading Wikipedia one night.
[34:15.060 --> 34:17.200]  And, uh, she was mentioning a bunch of stuff to me.
[34:17.740 --> 34:22.040]  In that, I was really hyping up that Willard Scott was a big time celebrity
[34:22.040 --> 34:22.820]  and it was a big deal.
[34:22.960 --> 34:26.780]  And then it was incredibly demoralizing when you guys didn't know who Willard Scott is.
[34:27.020 --> 34:29.200]  Who, by the way, I still think I get it cause you're not American,
[34:29.240 --> 34:31.720]  but I think anybody in America knows who Willard Scott is, hopefully.
[34:32.140 --> 34:33.560]  At least anybody over 25.
[34:34.500 --> 34:38.200]  And, uh, he's the Smuckers guy who, uh, yeah.
[34:38.200 --> 34:42.640]  And, uh, however, I messed up and I said Wilford Brimley
[34:42.640 --> 34:45.480]  and then I had to correct myself and say Willard Scott.
[34:45.660 --> 34:46.720]  Yeah, that was great.
[34:46.860 --> 34:52.760]  What actually happened is when I ingested the information,
[34:53.120 --> 34:58.360]  I somehow transposed Willard Scott and Wilford Brimley in my head.
[34:58.660 --> 35:02.300]  And so when I learned it was Willard Scott in the moment,
[35:02.520 --> 35:03.940]  I thought it was Wilford Brimley.
[35:04.100 --> 35:07.480]  This entire time, I thought it was Wilford Brimley.
[35:07.480 --> 35:09.860]  I have been telling people that aren't you guys
[35:09.860 --> 35:12.480]  that Wilford Brimley invented Ronald McDonald.
[35:13.180 --> 35:15.220]  And that he was the original Ronald McDonald.
[35:15.560 --> 35:18.860]  When I went to my own notes, which I copied from Wikipedia,
[35:19.280 --> 35:21.520]  and I read them to you guys and I read Willard Scott,
[35:21.760 --> 35:22.660]  I thought, that's weird.
[35:22.800 --> 35:25.740]  I must have mistyped or like, what a weird autocorrect.
[35:25.860 --> 35:26.620]  That doesn't make any sense.
[35:26.660 --> 35:27.780]  And I got tongue tied for a second.
[35:28.000 --> 35:29.420]  So then I was like Googling it.
[35:29.460 --> 35:33.540]  And when I Googled it, Wilford Brimley McDonald's does not come up.
[35:34.220 --> 35:36.460]  Willard Scott McDonald's came up really fast.
[35:36.460 --> 35:40.060]  And I realized it was never Wilford Brimley this entire time.
[35:40.160 --> 35:41.740]  It was always Willard Scott.
[35:42.260 --> 35:45.100]  I completely overhyped this thinking it was Wilford Brimley.
[35:45.340 --> 35:46.540]  And I spent weeks.
[35:46.940 --> 35:49.120]  I think I told my mom about this.
[35:49.180 --> 35:51.860]  I told people, I told other friends about this.
[35:51.920 --> 35:52.800]  I told Emily's friends.
[35:52.880 --> 35:55.660]  I told Emily's family about Wilford Brimley.
[35:56.100 --> 35:59.320]  I probably told 25 people that Wilford Brimley invented Ronald McDonald.
[35:59.660 --> 36:03.120]  And then I found out in the moment from my own notes
[36:03.120 --> 36:08.560]  that I had my dumb ass just misread.
[36:08.560 --> 36:12.560]  I just read Willard Scott as Wilford Brimley somehow and got it wrong.
[36:12.760 --> 36:14.980]  And it just fucked me up in the moment.
[36:15.060 --> 36:16.520]  And I didn't know how to recover from it.
[36:16.620 --> 36:19.480]  And I just stumbled through it and ended up picking the wrong side
[36:19.480 --> 36:20.780]  because I didn't know how to explain this.
[36:21.340 --> 36:22.900]  And then I felt so guilty about it.
[36:22.960 --> 36:24.220]  After the episode, I had to call Gavin.
[36:24.620 --> 36:28.460]  And it was such an amazing pivot, though,
[36:28.460 --> 36:30.480]  because I wouldn't have guessed that from based on what happened.
[36:30.480 --> 36:34.340]  It's so much more the complicated move when you were like,
[36:34.560 --> 36:39.140]  oh, you couldn't just be like, oh, I wrote it wrong or I remembered it wrong.
[36:39.760 --> 36:42.280]  It wasn't an instance of you've screwed up in one moment.
[36:42.400 --> 36:44.060]  You've had this wrong the entire time.
[36:44.080 --> 36:45.020]  The entire time.
[36:45.260 --> 36:48.240]  Yeah, and I've been passing disinformation on.
[36:49.320 --> 36:51.500]  And then you're suddenly having to hype up
[36:52.080 --> 36:55.340]  the other guy as though he's as famous as Wilford Brimley.
[36:55.680 --> 36:57.240]  I love Willard Scott.
[36:57.620 --> 36:59.600]  Willard Scott is no Wilford Brimley.
[37:00.480 --> 37:02.520]  I recognize and acknowledge that.
[37:02.660 --> 37:04.300]  And boy, talk about being crestfallen
[37:04.300 --> 37:08.140]  in the moment when I realized I had been all excited about Wilford Brimley
[37:08.140 --> 37:09.740]  and it wasn't him and it was Willard Scott.
[37:10.060 --> 37:11.260]  That's a fucking letdown.
[37:11.400 --> 37:14.380]  And I was dealing with the emotional turmoil of that letdown,
[37:14.460 --> 37:16.620]  plus the embarrassment of getting it wrong,
[37:16.760 --> 37:18.300]  plus like the realization,
[37:18.640 --> 37:20.680]  like as I'm explaining this and trying to like,
[37:21.040 --> 37:24.560]  trying to trying to get my foot out of my own ass in front of you guys
[37:24.560 --> 37:25.660]  in the conversation,
[37:26.180 --> 37:29.380]  like pictures of people in my brain are popping up
[37:29.380 --> 37:30.840]  who I told about Wilford Brimley.
[37:30.960 --> 37:32.420]  And it's like, oh, there's another one.
[37:32.680 --> 37:33.320]  Oh, there's another one.
[37:33.420 --> 37:34.600]  Oh, my cousin and his husband.
[37:34.800 --> 37:37.540]  Oh, there's and I'm just like, oh, my fucking God.
[37:37.840 --> 37:39.660]  It just got worse every second.
[37:40.400 --> 37:44.880]  Having to make like the STD calls of everyone you've told.
[37:45.240 --> 37:47.280]  Like, yeah, just say the information is correct.
[37:49.220 --> 37:50.580]  In fairness to you,
[37:51.120 --> 37:53.240]  if you just look at this photo of Wilford Brimley
[37:53.240 --> 37:55.780]  and someone said this man invented Ronald McDonald,
[37:55.920 --> 37:57.520]  I feel like it's very believable.
[37:57.860 --> 37:58.300]  You know what?
[37:58.300 --> 37:59.700]  In my heart, he did.
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.420]  It feels like that's the thing that man could have done.
[38:02.820 --> 38:05.640]  I would be unfazed if I didn't know who Wilford Brimley was.
[38:05.760 --> 38:08.120]  And you just said this guy invented Ronald McDonald.
[38:08.260 --> 38:09.500]  I'd be like, yeah, that makes sense.
[38:10.080 --> 38:11.980]  He looks like he in that photo.
[38:12.060 --> 38:15.520]  He looks like he looks like if Panama Jack got diabetes.
[38:18.000 --> 38:22.820]  You this makes so much sense now that you mixed it up for yourself
[38:22.820 --> 38:24.560]  and we had to be the ones to correct you,
[38:24.600 --> 38:28.020]  because when you kept hammering how cool it was
[38:28.020 --> 38:31.400]  and then I'm like, I'm like, yeah, that is kind of cool.
[38:31.400 --> 38:32.640]  But also like...
[38:32.640 --> 38:34.860]  And then you got a bit defensive when we were laughing.
[38:35.260 --> 38:36.100]  Yeah, it was.
[38:36.540 --> 38:37.740]  It all makes sense.
[38:37.820 --> 38:39.480]  And I love the phone call afterwards
[38:39.480 --> 38:41.200]  because it was the most one sided phone call.
[38:41.320 --> 38:43.520]  It was it was Geoff basically talking for two minutes.
[38:44.020 --> 38:45.100]  I didn't say a single...
[38:45.100 --> 38:47.320]  I was just laughing the entire time.
[38:48.580 --> 38:51.780]  I don't think I said more than like eight words on the whole phone call.
[38:52.340 --> 38:57.080]  There was so much build up to this super celebrity megastar is the creator.
[38:57.080 --> 39:00.220]  And Willard Scott is such a nothing for me.
[39:00.320 --> 39:03.360]  I forgot that that was the thing we even talked about in that episode.
[39:03.680 --> 39:04.800]  It's already left.
[39:05.460 --> 39:09.260]  What Gavin said after I was finished with my spiel is he said,
[39:09.360 --> 39:11.760]  this is the best phone call I've ever received.
[39:14.000 --> 39:15.640]  I just couldn't get enough.
[39:16.440 --> 39:18.960]  Oh, I'm out of mission too.
[39:19.220 --> 39:20.360]  That takes a lot.
[39:20.520 --> 39:21.640]  I was trying to get him.
[39:21.640 --> 39:26.540]  I was trying to get him to let to tell me I don't need to tell you guys.
[39:26.540 --> 39:28.640]  I was like, I don't need to mention this on the podcast, right?
[39:28.700 --> 39:29.580]  This isn't funny enough.
[39:29.680 --> 39:31.180]  And he was like, no, no, no, no.
[39:31.940 --> 39:33.280]  But I was like, it's probably not worth it.
[39:33.300 --> 39:33.940]  He's like, it's worth it.
[39:33.980 --> 39:34.540]  You got to do it.
[39:34.900 --> 39:36.620]  So it's so funny.
[39:36.740 --> 39:38.500]  There's my stupidity laid out bare.
[39:38.520 --> 39:43.560]  Oh, I really hope that that comes back to me in some way that like six months from now,
[39:43.600 --> 39:45.960]  I'm going to be somewhere and I'm going to overhear someone say,
[39:46.040 --> 39:48.460]  do you hear Wilford Brimley invented Ronald McDonald?
[39:48.680 --> 39:51.240]  Like, I just hope that misinformation spreads.
[39:51.960 --> 39:54.500]  Well, basically, we've potentially got a new verb out of that.
[39:54.500 --> 39:55.660]  Like Brimleying it.
[39:55.760 --> 39:56.260]  Brimleyed it?
[39:59.740 --> 40:00.840]  What would that be?
[40:00.960 --> 40:04.120]  That would be like when the core piece of information is wrong.
[40:05.100 --> 40:06.080]  Yeah, and it's on you.
[40:06.300 --> 40:06.960]  It's your fault.
[40:07.260 --> 40:08.100]  Like you were never right.
[40:08.440 --> 40:12.380]  I did that once on a podcast, I think, where I think Geoff was on it or it was after a podcast.
[40:13.620 --> 40:14.740]  And I read some info.
[40:14.900 --> 40:18.780]  I found out that like gin was just vodka.
[40:19.000 --> 40:22.580]  And I told I told everyone in the room and then everyone was like, no, you're an idiot.
[40:23.300 --> 40:25.880]  And then I realized I just, I think I just dreamt it.
[40:26.220 --> 40:31.280]  I think I dreamt someone being like, do you know that gin is just vodka with like something in it?
[40:31.360 --> 40:34.000]  And I was like, and I couldn't ever trace back.
[40:34.240 --> 40:34.600]  Like what?
[40:34.760 --> 40:36.240]  First, I thought I'd read it somewhere.
[40:36.360 --> 40:38.120]  So I started Googling it and nothing came up.
[40:38.120 --> 40:40.980]  And I was like, I must have just dreamt it.
[40:41.380 --> 40:43.200]  Forgot it was a dream and just started telling people.
[40:43.540 --> 40:46.020]  And Geoff, you were the one who were like, well, you're an idiot.
[40:46.160 --> 40:46.820]  What are you talking about?
[40:47.820 --> 40:49.000]  I have no memory of that.
[40:49.260 --> 40:51.400]  But yeah, Brimleyed it.
[40:51.480 --> 40:52.260]  You Brimleyed it.
[40:53.300 --> 40:56.560]  I feel like that kind of happens with song lyrics all the time, too.
[40:56.780 --> 40:59.840]  Like just not hearing them correctly and then living for years,
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.920]  thinking a song goes a certain way when it's not at all accurate.
[41:02.920 --> 41:06.900]  I do that all the time where I'll just fill in based on what it sounds like.
[41:07.080 --> 41:09.400]  And then I'll know I'm not doing it right.
[41:09.700 --> 41:12.960]  Like sometimes I'll just even replace lyrics with just something insane,
[41:13.060 --> 41:14.780]  knowing it's wrong just because I don't know the real lyrics.
[41:14.960 --> 41:18.880]  And then I'll look up the real lyrics and I still don't use them.
[41:19.140 --> 41:21.680]  Like I have some songs where I didn't really sing the wrong thing.
[41:21.680 --> 41:24.740]  Like that Bon Jovi song.
[41:27.020 --> 41:30.780]  The first line I think is, Tommy used to work on the docks, right?
[41:32.020 --> 41:33.980]  Then some blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[41:34.180 --> 41:39.140]  The next verse I always sing it as, Gina drank a barrel of AIDS.
[41:39.540 --> 41:42.700]  I don't know why it fits so perfectly.
[41:45.840 --> 41:49.740]  That's always replaced the actual lyrics for me and I can't understand why.
[41:50.160 --> 41:51.460]  It sounds better in your head now, right?
[41:52.040 --> 41:52.400]  Yeah.
[41:52.840 --> 41:54.020]  Not the actual lyrics.
[41:54.140 --> 41:57.280]  Have you ever had a situation where like you're doing karaoke and that has fucked you?
[41:57.420 --> 42:00.020]  Like you've just said what you believe instead of...
[42:00.020 --> 42:02.920]  just like that would play so poorly to a group of random people.
[42:03.140 --> 42:05.380]  I would never do karaoke. That'll never be a problem.
[42:05.380 --> 42:07.560]  Yeah, I don't think... I've never done it and I don't think I ever should.
[42:08.040 --> 42:08.500]  That's fair.
[42:08.700 --> 42:10.760]  I have that with... I don't like Pearl Jam very much,
[42:10.800 --> 42:13.400]  but there's one song I do kind of dig from Pearl Jam.
[42:13.540 --> 42:15.540]  And I thought for years the line was like,
[42:15.880 --> 42:19.280]  it's like she lies and says she's in love with him, can't find the butter man.
[42:19.280 --> 42:21.160]  And apparently it's a better man.
[42:21.320 --> 42:25.300]  And I figured that out eventually, but I like the idea of a butter man.
[42:25.460 --> 42:27.700]  And so I've been saying that for... I continue to do that.
[42:27.820 --> 42:31.520]  That's the name of the song is Better Man.
[42:31.960 --> 42:33.780]  Yeah, it was like track three or something.
[42:33.900 --> 42:37.620]  And when it was on my CD player, I don't pay attention to names of songs.
[42:38.480 --> 42:39.520]  Oh, that's so good.
[42:39.800 --> 42:41.460]  It's like, what's your favorite Polo G song?
[42:41.520 --> 42:43.420]  I don't know, number three, number six and number nine.
[42:43.560 --> 42:45.760]  I don't keep that information.
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.180]  If I'm not looking at a vinyl, I don't need to know it.
[42:49.560 --> 42:50.640]  Do you do that, Andrew?
[42:51.240 --> 42:54.940]  Yeah, I had one very recently with the Nickelback song Rockstar,
[42:55.120 --> 42:58.020]  where I completely misheard a section of it.
[42:58.500 --> 43:02.480]  And the follow up lyric, which I did remember correctly, validated my belief.
[43:03.020 --> 43:08.320]  It was the lyric was something like live in hilltop houses, driving 15 cars.
[43:08.580 --> 43:11.360]  And up until like last week, I'd always heard it as
[43:11.360 --> 43:16.040]  live with a big, tough posse driving 15 cars.
[43:16.200 --> 43:18.600]  And in my head, I was like, well, you're a big, big tough posse.
[43:18.600 --> 43:19.640]  You've got a big posse.
[43:19.740 --> 43:22.880]  You're going to need you're going to need a variety of vehicles for your posse.
[43:23.200 --> 43:24.320]  That just checks out.
[43:24.540 --> 43:26.660]  So if anything, it makes more sense than the actual lyric.
[43:26.900 --> 43:27.300]  Possibly.
[43:27.420 --> 43:29.020]  Yeah, they're all going to need to get around.
[43:29.780 --> 43:34.000]  I wonder if we could find like if we could just pay attention when we're listening to songs,
[43:34.300 --> 43:36.600]  compile a list of all the lyrics that we've gotten wrong
[43:36.600 --> 43:41.460]  and then petition the artists to change them to our lyrics because they're better.
[43:42.340 --> 43:43.720]  I don't think Bon Jovi will do much.
[43:45.500 --> 43:47.140]  No, I think it's a tough case.
[43:47.140 --> 43:49.460]  I like the idea, though, of like lyric court,
[43:49.800 --> 43:54.840]  like a Judge Joe Brown situation where you take an artist to trial over their lyrical usage,
[43:55.260 --> 43:57.940]  try to get it changed because you have a better combination of words.
[43:58.340 --> 43:59.780]  It's an outrage. It's dumb.
[44:00.280 --> 44:03.100]  Maybe we should ask some of the comment leavers or regulation listeners to
[44:03.100 --> 44:08.900]  become comment leavers and see any sort of in-brained lyric changes that they've done
[44:08.900 --> 44:09.460]  over the years.
[44:09.780 --> 44:11.760]  Yeah, what are your myths of unintentional ones?
[44:12.880 --> 44:15.400]  Yeah, I'd love to. I'd love to have that information.
[44:16.040 --> 44:19.780]  Speaking of food stuff, I've elevated.
[44:20.380 --> 44:22.720]  As you guys all know, I'm a desk chef.
[44:23.080 --> 44:23.620]  Proud of it.
[44:23.660 --> 44:25.800]  I've innovated in the chef realm.
[44:26.260 --> 44:27.500]  But we had a conversation.
[44:28.000 --> 44:30.260]  I don't remember if it was last episode or the one before it,
[44:30.540 --> 44:33.420]  where we exchanged Thanksgiving recipes.
[44:33.800 --> 44:34.940]  We did a whole thing about it.
[44:35.320 --> 44:39.480]  And Gavin, who remembered and did a lot of prep for it,
[44:39.980 --> 44:44.320]  posted a photo of tater tots and cranberry sauce.
[44:44.320 --> 44:46.840]  That was his great recipe.
[44:47.100 --> 44:47.700]  That was my stuffing.
[44:48.220 --> 44:50.020]  It was, yeah. Well, it was your stuffing.
[44:50.520 --> 44:52.900]  But I was thinking, I thought a lot about it.
[44:52.960 --> 44:57.200]  It hit me later in the evening, that I should take this dish on.
[44:57.320 --> 45:00.860]  Because I think there's potential within this dish.
[45:00.960 --> 45:03.220]  There's something there for it.
[45:03.860 --> 45:07.840]  And as a Canadian, especially, I thought, I'm qualified for this.
[45:08.040 --> 45:12.400]  Because I realized, in a sense, you've just created festive poutine.
[45:12.400 --> 45:14.460]  Poutine, big part of Canadian culture.
[45:14.660 --> 45:16.900]  You get your fries, cover it in gravy.
[45:17.340 --> 45:18.340]  You got cheese curds.
[45:18.800 --> 45:24.340]  What if, what if a cranteen were to exist for the holiday times?
[45:24.820 --> 45:28.380]  A tater tot dish with cranberry sauce.
[45:28.720 --> 45:30.300]  Yeah, delicious cranteen.
[45:30.300 --> 45:31.080]  Sounds like an ointment.
[45:34.200 --> 45:37.480]  Cranteen is making my balls burn like crazy right now, actually.
[45:37.540 --> 45:38.980]  Sounds like jock itch medicine.
[45:39.480 --> 45:41.340]  No, no, I don't want that.
[45:41.340 --> 45:42.080]  God damn it.
[45:42.200 --> 45:43.020]  This is delicious.
[45:43.520 --> 45:44.660]  There's a potential to be a delicious dish.
[45:44.860 --> 45:47.200]  So I went out, I got all the things needed for it.
[45:47.260 --> 45:49.860]  I got the homemade cranberry sauce.
[45:49.940 --> 45:55.780]  Got some bacon, mozzarella cheese, and a nice big bag of tater tots.
[45:56.140 --> 45:59.720]  I got the mix going and I made cranteen.
[46:00.260 --> 46:01.220]  You got all that for Christmas.
[46:01.320 --> 46:01.680]  Look at that.
[46:01.760 --> 46:01.900]  Wow.
[46:02.140 --> 46:02.700]  I did.
[46:02.880 --> 46:03.120]  Oh, yeah.
[46:03.220 --> 46:04.020]  Obviously, got to have decorations.
[46:04.020 --> 46:04.440]  Oh, yeah.
[46:04.540 --> 46:05.960]  Let's dissect this photo.
[46:06.260 --> 46:06.620]  All right.
[46:06.700 --> 46:07.180]  Let's do it.
[46:07.460 --> 46:08.460]  One, two, three.
[46:08.580 --> 46:08.840]  What's that thing?
[46:08.980 --> 46:10.020]  You have five Christmas trees.
[46:10.020 --> 46:11.440]  What's that thing in the jug?
[46:12.720 --> 46:13.880]  That's the cranberry sauce.
[46:14.100 --> 46:16.240]  Yeah, but what's the ring in it?
[46:16.560 --> 46:18.500]  So Gavin, I was looking at that too.
[46:18.760 --> 46:21.720]  That instead of just the measurements on the side that you see on one side.
[46:21.960 --> 46:22.360]  Oh, I see.
[46:22.400 --> 46:24.900]  It's just so like when you're looking down at it from the back.
[46:25.180 --> 46:26.920]  It's called a liquid measuring cup.
[46:27.140 --> 46:30.300]  Yeah, it confused the shit out of me when he first...
[46:30.300 --> 46:32.320]  It was like, was that the thing we're not going to talk about?
[46:32.380 --> 46:33.380]  And then I figured it out.
[46:33.720 --> 46:34.580]  Dude, that is fancy.
[46:34.680 --> 46:35.560]  I've never seen one like that.
[46:35.680 --> 46:36.820]  You've got the fanciest stuff.
[46:37.180 --> 46:37.660]  Oh, it's nice.
[46:38.140 --> 46:38.780]  It's nice.
[46:38.780 --> 46:41.460]  Listen, as a desk chef, I take all cooking very seriously.
[46:41.560 --> 46:43.000]  You got to have the right tools, the right equipment.
[46:43.160 --> 46:44.260]  Right, but that's not your desk, though.
[46:44.300 --> 46:44.940]  That is in the kitchen.
[46:45.200 --> 46:46.160]  That's exactly right.
[46:46.200 --> 46:49.420]  I'm saying, but as a desk chef, I take cooking seriously.
[46:49.780 --> 46:52.020]  No matter where the situation is, you got to be prepared.
[46:52.360 --> 46:57.860]  So I put the tater tots on, heated up some bacon, mozzarella instead of like
[46:57.860 --> 46:59.820]  the cheese curd, homemade cranberry sauce.
[46:59.940 --> 47:02.320]  And this is, let me introduce you to some cranteen.
[47:02.600 --> 47:04.460]  Some delicious cranteen.
[47:05.340 --> 47:06.840]  Got to mix it all in.
[47:08.920 --> 47:11.980]  And let me say, it was very good.
[47:12.180 --> 47:13.360]  It was shockingly good.
[47:13.420 --> 47:14.240]  There's room for improvement.
[47:14.380 --> 47:15.080]  Needs more bacon.
[47:15.340 --> 47:16.220]  Needs more cheese.
[47:16.300 --> 47:17.060]  I was a little bit worried.
[47:17.400 --> 47:21.940]  I was worried about the cheese cranberry mix, but it was it was tasty.
[47:22.140 --> 47:23.400]  Gavin, are you sure you need cheese?
[47:24.820 --> 47:29.660]  Uh, well, if you're going for the poutine effect, I would say you need cheese.
[47:29.940 --> 47:32.380]  How fast were you moving when you took this photo?
[47:33.400 --> 47:33.880]  What do you mean?
[47:34.340 --> 47:36.260]  I mean, look at the tree behind it.
[47:36.340 --> 47:37.960]  It's pretty, it's like a motion blur.
[47:37.960 --> 47:38.600]  Yeah.
[47:39.160 --> 47:39.640]  Oh.
[47:40.020 --> 47:42.240]  This is like a Geoff level photograph.
[47:42.640 --> 47:42.980]  Fuck that.
[47:43.000 --> 47:43.980]  No, it's not.
[47:44.280 --> 47:46.040]  It's absolutely, get out of here.
[47:46.120 --> 47:50.220]  Like the middle tater tot is totally in focus and the tater tots on the right,
[47:50.360 --> 47:53.600]  where it looks like the jizz is, completely in motion.
[47:54.060 --> 47:55.340]  I agree with Geoff.
[47:55.740 --> 47:57.800]  I agree with Geoff that it looks blurry.
[47:58.160 --> 48:01.160]  This is not a Geoff level photograph.
[48:01.180 --> 48:01.840]  No, absolutely not.
[48:01.900 --> 48:02.380]  100%.
[48:02.380 --> 48:02.860]  100%.
[48:02.860 --> 48:04.060]  Absolutely not.
[48:04.180 --> 48:04.420]  100%.
[48:04.420 --> 48:07.860]  It just looks like when I used to overuse radial blur when I first got Photoshopped.
[48:10.380 --> 48:12.220]  No, I just, I'm bad at taking photos.
[48:12.360 --> 48:14.480]  Not Geoff bad, but not great at it.
[48:14.960 --> 48:18.960]  So how do you think that would, how do you think that would sit in a turkey?
[48:19.140 --> 48:20.800]  If you were, if you were going to try it as stuffing?
[48:21.040 --> 48:23.340]  No, no, I think it'd be terrible in a turkey.
[48:23.460 --> 48:26.940]  I'm not, I don't like stuffing in turkey generally, but I think as a dish,
[48:27.080 --> 48:30.140]  I would actually encourage people to try cranteen.
[48:30.300 --> 48:31.660]  Yeah, I think it's surprisingly good.
[48:31.920 --> 48:34.420]  So try it as, try it as a dressing, not a stuffing.
[48:34.580 --> 48:36.000]  It's stuffing when it goes in the turkey.
[48:36.020 --> 48:37.240]  It's dressing when it doesn't.
[48:37.240 --> 48:40.380]  That is just, it's a shitload of cranberry though.
[48:40.540 --> 48:43.040]  That like, I feel like whenever you have cranberry, it's like a little dollop.
[48:43.800 --> 48:44.440]  It's a lot.
[48:44.600 --> 48:45.080]  Yeah, you're right.
[48:45.160 --> 48:47.060]  I was trying to like get the right amount.
[48:47.160 --> 48:49.400]  I was trying to match the gravy with cranberry ratio.
[48:49.540 --> 48:54.460]  There's definitely things to adjust in it, but I was surprised by how good it is.
[48:54.740 --> 48:58.520]  It's a great, the sweetness with the saltiness of the maple bacon.
[48:58.960 --> 49:00.340]  And then you have to just, oh, it's good.
[49:00.580 --> 49:00.900]  It was good.
[49:00.920 --> 49:01.880]  It was shockingly good.
[49:02.660 --> 49:03.500]  But my innovation...
[49:03.500 --> 49:04.000]  That's one for the recipe book.
[49:04.380 --> 49:04.820]  It is.
[49:05.200 --> 49:06.100]  And I got another recipe.
[49:06.100 --> 49:09.540]  My innovation didn't stop there because I, you know, recently...
[49:09.540 --> 49:10.480]  You're going to top Krantin?
[49:10.860 --> 49:15.080]  I'm going to, I'm not going to say I'm going to top Krantin, but I was, I was in,
[49:15.220 --> 49:17.260]  I was in the kitchen once again, elevating.
[49:17.800 --> 49:21.240]  As we all know, I just recently returned from Austin.
[49:21.880 --> 49:25.400]  And one of my favorite staples of Austin, one of my favorite things I love.
[49:26.260 --> 49:28.240]  And it makes me upset that they're not everywhere.
[49:28.620 --> 49:29.580]  It's breakfast tacos.
[49:30.280 --> 49:32.240]  Breakfast tacos are a fucking joy.
[49:32.460 --> 49:33.300]  I love them so much.
[49:33.400 --> 49:34.080]  They're delicious.
[49:34.080 --> 49:35.540]  Oh, they got the crunch.
[49:35.620 --> 49:36.500]  You got the potatoes in there.
[49:36.700 --> 49:37.760]  It is wonderful.
[49:37.880 --> 49:39.840]  But we don't have them where I live.
[49:40.120 --> 49:43.140]  I've never experienced a great breakfast taco anywhere else.
[49:43.200 --> 49:46.080]  Not that I'm well-traveled, but they certainly aren't here.
[49:46.480 --> 49:50.120]  So I was, I was missing, I was missing Austin, the place I just left.
[49:50.720 --> 49:51.540]  Stop saying that.
[49:52.020 --> 49:53.780]  Well, we don't have breakfast tacos.
[49:54.500 --> 49:57.380]  Maybe I can make something because they've, they're well-established.
[49:57.480 --> 49:59.340]  So I guess we just don't want them for whatever reason.
[49:59.720 --> 50:02.180]  Maybe I could make something else.
[50:02.180 --> 50:04.400]  So I have invented.
[50:04.640 --> 50:06.160]  I don't think anyone's done this before.
[50:06.620 --> 50:08.980]  Let me introduce you to the Pulpoza.
[50:09.280 --> 50:11.100]  The breakfast Pulpoza.
[50:11.620 --> 50:14.420]  This is a tortilla.
[50:15.180 --> 50:18.280]  Fitting in the same tradition as the breakfast taco.
[50:18.700 --> 50:22.140]  You got your ketchup as the red sauce.
[50:22.420 --> 50:24.520]  Got some olive oil for cooking the food.
[50:25.020 --> 50:29.160]  You got hash browns in place of cheese on the Pulpoza.
[50:29.760 --> 50:32.480]  And then some pineapple, because I love it's my favorite pizza taco.
[50:32.500 --> 50:32.980]  Why are you calling it?
[50:33.480 --> 50:34.100]  It's a Pulpoza.
[50:34.620 --> 50:35.780]  A breakfast Pulpoza.
[50:37.600 --> 50:38.920]  Potato pineapple pizza.
[50:39.680 --> 50:40.400]  Breakfast Pulpoza.
[50:40.700 --> 50:42.480]  What does it have to do with being a taco?
[50:43.260 --> 50:44.760]  Well, because it's a breakfast taco.
[50:44.820 --> 50:46.740]  We don't have breakfast tacos where I live.
[50:46.900 --> 50:47.760]  So clearly you're just not going to...
[50:47.760 --> 50:48.080]  So fucking make one.
[50:48.160 --> 50:49.340]  You've got a tortilla right there.
[50:49.400 --> 50:51.120]  Put eggs in it and you've got a breakfast taco.
[50:51.440 --> 50:53.040]  Why, why are you replacing?
[50:53.320 --> 50:55.900]  Why is the cheese replacement hash browns?
[50:56.260 --> 50:57.000]  Because it's shredded.
[50:57.180 --> 50:58.320]  It has a very cheese like...
[50:58.320 --> 50:59.580]  That's what it is?
[50:59.760 --> 51:01.540]  That's the thing that you think replaces?
[51:01.720 --> 51:02.340]  It's shredded?
[51:02.800 --> 51:06.340]  Yeah, you could buy potato in a carton.
[51:06.420 --> 51:09.200]  Yeah, dehydrated hash browns.
[51:09.260 --> 51:11.540]  He's like, I really like breakfast tacos.
[51:11.740 --> 51:13.340]  So I decided to make a pizza.
[51:13.860 --> 51:15.520]  No, listen, you're not listening to me, Geoff.
[51:16.040 --> 51:18.800]  The breakfast taco has been around for a long time.
[51:19.320 --> 51:21.380]  We have not adopted the breakfast taco.
[51:21.620 --> 51:24.180]  We clearly do not want the breakfast taco.
[51:24.360 --> 51:26.280]  If we wanted the breakfast taco,
[51:26.280 --> 51:28.960]  it's been around long enough and established enough.
[51:29.080 --> 51:30.120]  It would be here.
[51:30.240 --> 51:35.340]  So I'm trying to make an alternative to the breakfast taco that might catch on.
[51:35.440 --> 51:37.440]  Because we don't have a breakfast pulpoza.
[51:37.940 --> 51:40.960]  So it's almost like tricking people into having breakfast tacos.
[51:41.080 --> 51:43.400]  It's, I'm trying to get something close to it.
[51:43.480 --> 51:45.220]  And this is my creation, the breakfast pulpoza.
[51:45.320 --> 51:46.860]  So it's very, it's a simple start.
[51:46.940 --> 51:47.980]  You get your tortilla shell.
[51:48.420 --> 51:49.140]  You put it down.
[51:49.580 --> 51:50.680]  Drop some ketchup in it.
[51:50.780 --> 51:52.300]  Spread it out just like a pizza.
[51:52.420 --> 51:54.040]  It's like we're going with a pizza base here.
[51:54.040 --> 51:55.240]  We're getting it going.
[51:55.260 --> 51:56.520]  Would you say that's too much sauce?
[51:57.100 --> 51:58.540]  I mean, it's ketchup.
[51:59.260 --> 51:59.920]  So yeah.
[52:00.620 --> 52:01.100]  Really?
[52:01.580 --> 52:02.180]  You know what?
[52:02.300 --> 52:04.560]  You know, two great flavors that go great together.
[52:04.780 --> 52:05.860]  Ketchup and pineapple.
[52:07.000 --> 52:08.260]  This is insane.
[52:08.480 --> 52:09.060]  It's a red sauce.
[52:09.060 --> 52:12.460]  Andrew, this is like, this is really something else.
[52:12.500 --> 52:13.220]  No, just wait.
[52:13.260 --> 52:13.900]  Just wait a second.
[52:14.080 --> 52:14.720]  We're gonna, we're going.
[52:14.900 --> 52:17.460]  We're going to have access to nice pizza sauce.
[52:17.500 --> 52:18.380]  That's ketchup.
[52:18.880 --> 52:20.400]  Yeah, because it's hash browns.
[52:20.500 --> 52:22.680]  I love, ketchup and hash browns are a great combination.
[52:23.240 --> 52:23.680]  It's delicious.
[52:24.180 --> 52:25.260]  Okay, keep going.
[52:25.480 --> 52:25.800]  Tortilla.
[52:26.040 --> 52:26.580]  Pineapple's my favorite.
[52:26.820 --> 52:27.620]  So you get the tortilla.
[52:28.000 --> 52:29.480]  You put the sauce down, right?
[52:29.600 --> 52:30.100]  That's step one.
[52:30.420 --> 52:35.140]  Then you cook the hash brown and you lay it out and it looks just like shredded cheese.
[52:35.220 --> 52:36.540]  You got a nice shredded cheese base.
[52:36.780 --> 52:40.380]  You look like you got a cheese pizza, but it's a Pulp-a-Za.
[52:40.720 --> 52:41.960]  It's a breakfast Pulp-a-Za.
[52:42.680 --> 52:43.580]  So you get that going.
[52:44.160 --> 52:45.340]  Then you cook up the bacon.
[52:45.560 --> 52:46.840]  This is where I made my mistake.
[52:47.300 --> 52:52.080]  What I should have done is I should have heated the tortilla first because you want it brown.
[52:52.080 --> 52:56.240]  So you got a crunch and it also helps with the durability, like holding the weight.
[52:56.640 --> 53:00.080]  Because you don't want, you don't want just a loose, like not cooked tortilla.
[53:00.480 --> 53:01.100]  It will not hold.
[53:02.200 --> 53:03.540]  So you get that on.
[53:03.680 --> 53:04.540]  I did in the wrong order.
[53:04.660 --> 53:05.340]  I did that last.
[53:05.420 --> 53:06.000]  That should be the first.
[53:06.100 --> 53:06.920]  Eric is livid.
[53:08.100 --> 53:10.360]  This, this is the craziest fucking thing.
[53:10.860 --> 53:12.480]  No, this is so out of control.
[53:12.640 --> 53:13.660]  Like, I don't even know.
[53:13.880 --> 53:20.340]  Andrew, it's like, it's like an alien saw food and then tried to make it base.
[53:20.480 --> 53:21.400]  This is crazy.
[53:21.400 --> 53:23.160]  This is so fucking nuts.
[53:23.340 --> 53:24.680]  I just want a breakfast taco.
[53:25.060 --> 53:25.920]  And it's not going to happen.
[53:26.080 --> 53:26.520]  Oh my God.
[53:26.720 --> 53:30.240]  And listen, I was, Eric, I was reminiscing about my time in Austin.
[53:30.500 --> 53:31.940]  I was missing the breakfast tacos.
[53:32.580 --> 53:38.100]  And so I had to clearly, clearly never been to Austin or seen a breakfast taco in person.
[53:38.280 --> 53:39.460]  Oh no, I've had several.
[53:39.740 --> 53:40.300]  I love them.
[53:40.380 --> 53:41.920]  That's one of my favorite things to get.
[53:42.020 --> 53:43.800]  I don't know how you got from there to this.
[53:44.100 --> 53:47.400]  I can ask you to, can I ask you, I know you said you made a mistake with the tortilla.
[53:48.000 --> 53:49.320]  Can you keep going?
[53:49.440 --> 53:53.120]  Cause I have to see how the pineapple plays into this fucking minstrel.
[53:53.300 --> 53:53.820]  Absolutely.
[53:54.020 --> 53:56.620]  So the next step is you got to get your bacon going.
[53:56.720 --> 54:00.400]  You cook your bacon and you put it on with the pineapple.
[54:00.400 --> 54:01.260]  You get it on top.
[54:01.340 --> 54:05.040]  So now you look like, look at how delicious that looks.
[54:05.080 --> 54:07.020]  You got the salty with the sweet.
[54:07.140 --> 54:08.960]  You got the ketchup with the potatoes.
[54:09.320 --> 54:10.580]  Everything's enhancing each other.
[54:10.680 --> 54:15.340]  The problem is that is not a cooked tortilla shell at all.
[54:15.460 --> 54:16.840]  It's just, it's going to be difficult.
[54:16.840 --> 54:22.640]  After a lot of difficult moving from the plate to the oven,
[54:23.440 --> 54:24.360]  I cooked it.
[54:24.680 --> 54:26.500]  And this is the final result.
[54:26.880 --> 54:27.660]  Look at this.
[54:27.780 --> 54:29.840]  Look at how fucking delicious this looks.
[54:30.140 --> 54:32.260]  Nice and crispy around the edges.
[54:32.720 --> 54:36.600]  You got your pineapple, you got your bacon, the sweetness, the ketchup.
[54:37.040 --> 54:39.180]  And honestly, Eric, not enough sauce.
[54:39.480 --> 54:40.440]  That's one of my other things.
[54:40.520 --> 54:41.700]  It needed more ketchup.
[54:42.240 --> 54:43.280]  It lacked ketchup.
[54:43.820 --> 54:46.100]  Probably needs cheese.
[54:46.100 --> 54:51.020]  The one thing that's so easy to add at the end of cooking is you didn't put it on.
[54:51.240 --> 54:53.020]  Well, it just felt weird to put on top.
[54:53.020 --> 54:54.940]  It felt like it needed to be below.
[54:56.440 --> 55:04.200]  What you've created is a Hawaiian pizza for lactose intolerant people.
[55:04.640 --> 55:07.660]  No, listen, it's got everything you need when you start your day.
[55:07.720 --> 55:09.040]  You got some carbs with the potatoes.
[55:09.260 --> 55:10.220]  You got the bacon.
[55:10.420 --> 55:11.340]  You got some fruit.
[55:11.440 --> 55:12.840]  Get that vitamin C.
[55:12.940 --> 55:14.600]  I'm assuming, what does pineapple have?
[55:14.660 --> 55:15.220]  Is it vitamin C?
[55:15.220 --> 55:17.440]  It's got to have something good in it.
[55:17.580 --> 55:19.220]  It's a good start to your day.
[55:19.620 --> 55:23.320]  Wake up, get a breakfast pulp pizza, and just start your day.
[55:23.380 --> 55:23.900]  Here, I cut it.
[55:24.060 --> 55:25.620]  Your piss would be smelling pretty good after that.
[55:26.020 --> 55:27.480]  And Matt, yeah, you have two of these.
[55:27.760 --> 55:28.880]  Great smelling piss.
[55:29.440 --> 55:32.240]  Had to take a little cut, a little slice, a little slice of the pulp pizza.
[55:33.100 --> 55:35.220]  All in all, pretty fucking good.
[55:35.720 --> 55:35.920]  Don't eat that.
[55:36.340 --> 55:38.700]  The first bite you take from that, it's going everywhere.
[55:39.040 --> 55:39.240]  No!
[55:39.440 --> 55:41.940]  I want to see what's under you after you've finished eating that.
[55:41.980 --> 55:42.760]  No, no, no, no.
[55:42.820 --> 55:44.560]  You gotta, you hold it the right way.
[55:44.560 --> 55:45.600]  There's a technique to it.
[55:45.640 --> 55:50.040]  But I think if I were to do the tortilla first and really get that crunchy,
[55:50.640 --> 55:52.160]  reduce some of the hash browns,
[55:52.820 --> 55:55.340]  probably get rid of the pineapple and put some cheese on there.
[55:55.920 --> 55:58.420]  That's a great, that's a great breakfast pizza.
[55:59.040 --> 56:01.480]  What if you just put a little dollop of cranteen on top?
[56:01.600 --> 56:02.260]  How do you think that would go?
[56:02.600 --> 56:04.140]  That's, that would be way too much.
[56:04.260 --> 56:05.480]  That's not a good balance of flavor.
[56:05.900 --> 56:08.560]  But the sweet and salty, you guys are reluctant to this.
[56:08.660 --> 56:11.080]  I'm gonna, I'll put one of these together for you.
[56:11.140 --> 56:11.960]  You're gonna see the way.
[56:12.380 --> 56:13.840]  I'm not a big ketchup guy, I'll be honest.
[56:13.840 --> 56:15.280]  No, I'm with Gavin.
[56:15.560 --> 56:19.500]  And also, how do you spell pulp, pulp, pulp is a, pulp is a?
[56:19.520 --> 56:20.180]  Here, it's easy.
[56:20.320 --> 56:24.860]  Let me, I'll, I'll just copy and paste and drag it over.
[56:25.480 --> 56:27.060]  Uh, couldn't just say it out loud, but.
[56:27.600 --> 56:31.900]  Oh, no, it's, I'm gonna, you know, I'm just gonna put it here so you can see it.
[56:32.100 --> 56:33.020]  Instead of spelling it out loud.
[56:33.500 --> 56:35.640]  That's not how I wrote.
[56:36.080 --> 56:37.300]  Okay, I'm glad I asked.
[56:37.800 --> 56:39.400]  Hey Geoff, is that how you would have spelled that?
[56:39.780 --> 56:40.600]  No, it is not.
[56:41.360 --> 56:42.720]  That is not how I would have spelled it.
[56:43.440 --> 56:46.980]  However, I guess it'll go, it'll go in the cookbook like that.
[56:47.240 --> 56:47.640]  Absolutely.
[56:48.060 --> 56:48.240]  Poepleza.
[56:49.780 --> 56:51.200]  Listen, I think there's a lot of innovation.
[56:51.400 --> 56:52.320]  I'm just, I'm excited.
[56:52.500 --> 56:53.260]  I'm a desk chef.
[56:53.360 --> 56:55.600]  I got into the real kitchen because I felt this needed it.
[56:55.820 --> 56:57.320]  I couldn't use the tools I have.
[56:57.740 --> 56:58.740]  There's a lot of room here.
[56:59.360 --> 57:01.660]  I was expecting a better reaction from you.
[57:01.680 --> 57:04.800]  I thought you'd be excited about the krantine and the pulpeza, but.
[57:05.720 --> 57:07.400]  I was excited about the krantine.
[57:07.500 --> 57:10.000]  I think the pulpeza is an affront to food.
[57:10.480 --> 57:10.760]  Really?
[57:10.920 --> 57:11.240]  Why?
[57:11.440 --> 57:11.680]  Yeah.
[57:11.940 --> 57:12.520]  What about it?
[57:12.520 --> 57:14.120]  Because of the ketchup and pineapple.
[57:14.940 --> 57:18.280]  Also, because you described it as missing a breakfast taco.
[57:18.700 --> 57:23.480]  And then left out the most important ingredient in breakfast tacos, which is 100% always egg.
[57:23.840 --> 57:24.420]  Yeah, but here's.
[57:24.420 --> 57:25.800]  Unless you're getting a bean and cheese taco.
[57:25.800 --> 57:27.620]  Can we talk about the egg thing for a minute?
[57:27.780 --> 57:28.820]  Because the egg has been.
[57:29.300 --> 57:31.440]  So this has been a problem in my life for a while now.
[57:31.520 --> 57:34.120]  As we established on this show.
[57:34.520 --> 57:36.900]  I don't think I've ever just had an egg before.
[57:37.280 --> 57:39.060]  I know I've had egg and other things.
[57:39.140 --> 57:41.160]  Like, I'm sure I've had some in like fried rice.
[57:41.160 --> 57:43.400]  But I've never tried scrambled eggs.
[57:43.680 --> 57:46.100]  And you were like, I'm going to make you scrambled eggs.
[57:46.200 --> 57:48.600]  So now it feels like a content thing.
[57:48.680 --> 57:50.720]  And there have been so many times.
[57:50.880 --> 57:52.020]  How long have we been doing this?
[57:52.060 --> 57:52.880]  For two and a half years?
[57:53.040 --> 57:58.680]  Where I'm in a position to have eggs and want eggs and say, no, I'm not going to have eggs.
[57:58.700 --> 58:00.380]  Because I feel like it's a content thing.
[58:00.660 --> 58:04.220]  I feel like I need to do it in a content situation.
[58:04.800 --> 58:05.940]  So that's why there are no eggs.
[58:06.180 --> 58:07.920]  Eggs are not a part of my life.
[58:07.980 --> 58:10.620]  Because I feel that will be a content thing that you're a part of.
[58:11.680 --> 58:13.720]  This is unreal.
[58:14.480 --> 58:19.280]  I'm struggling to look at the pulpoza and consider getting it down for dinner.
[58:19.380 --> 58:21.460]  I can't imagine having it for breakfast.
[58:21.920 --> 58:24.460]  Can you imagine those flavors in your mouth right when you wake up?
[58:24.700 --> 58:31.780]  I will say, I hate to fucking say it, but your egg explanation makes sense to me.
[58:31.880 --> 58:32.120]  Absolutely.
[58:32.720 --> 58:34.020]  I agree.
[58:34.440 --> 58:35.260]  Yeah, it's for content.
[58:35.260 --> 58:36.460]  What's the content thing at this point?
[58:36.480 --> 58:37.780]  No, hang on.
[58:38.080 --> 58:38.580]  Hang on.
[58:39.020 --> 58:39.420]  Hang on.
[58:39.420 --> 58:41.360]  I agree with the spirit.
[58:41.360 --> 58:45.100]  No, hey, I agree with the spirit of what he's saying.
[58:45.840 --> 58:48.080]  But what the fuck are we releasing?
[58:48.280 --> 58:51.760]  It's just filming Andrew eating eggs.
[58:51.760 --> 58:56.640]  We just recorded a five minute thing of you not putting on Icy Hot.
[58:56.920 --> 58:58.840]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[58:59.140 --> 59:00.820]  How is that lower than that?
[59:01.160 --> 59:03.680]  Right, Andrew, I agree, but that's bad.
[59:03.760 --> 59:04.620]  What are we doing?
[59:04.780 --> 59:06.660]  That's bad and we shouldn't have done it.
[59:06.680 --> 59:07.480]  No, I think it's great.
[59:07.480 --> 59:09.760]  This Best Buddy Award is out the window.
[59:10.320 --> 59:13.600]  Season five, Andrew is so much angrier than season one and two.
[59:15.060 --> 59:20.120]  He's saying I won't eat eggs because we're going to film me eating eggs.
[59:21.820 --> 59:24.960]  No, I'm not saying film, but I feel like it was talked about.
[59:25.060 --> 59:25.880]  It was part of the show.
[59:25.980 --> 59:29.160]  Like, I feel like that's a thing that is on the show.
[59:29.840 --> 59:34.060]  Life sometimes becomes content or might have the potential of content.
[59:34.280 --> 59:35.120]  So yeah, I can see it.
[59:37.580 --> 59:38.620]  I think that's valid.
[59:38.740 --> 59:39.660]  I think this is all valid.
[59:39.840 --> 59:40.520]  I think this is...
[59:40.520 --> 59:44.260]  I'm not shocked because innovation is often scoffed at initially.
[59:44.580 --> 59:48.120]  It might be a little bit ahead of the curve for your palates, but you'll see.
[59:48.680 --> 59:49.740]  I'm going to convert you both.
[59:50.520 --> 59:52.260]  The words that came out of your mouth, Andrew,
[59:52.300 --> 59:55.860]  that you were a little bit surprised at our reaction to that.
[59:56.340 --> 59:58.960]  And I would like to point out your reaction to my plowmans.
[59:59.300 --> 01:00:00.380]  That's what I was about to say.
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:04.860]  This motherfucker is coming at me for my pizza when he put onion and egg on his.
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.460]  He put pickle in the crust.
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:07.960]  Yeah, but you know what?
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:08.840]  You know what?
[01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:09.880]  He called it a pizza.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.320]  It is.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.420]  That's the za part of the Pulpiza.
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.580]  It's a breakfast Pulpiza.
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:19.140]  But you wanted a breakfast taco and you made a pizza.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.940]  Stop saying Pulpiza.
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.000]  Stop saying Pulpiza.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:24.840]  That's a breakfast Pulpiza.
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:25.260]  Stop.
[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:28.760]  We could change the name if you want.
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:30.000]  I mean, I'm not married to the name.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.020]  The name is the best part of it, honestly.
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:33.120]  At least yours.
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:35.460]  You'll see.
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:40.640]  Well, when you come over for whenever we do the bachelor party crabbing thing,
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:43.560]  I'll bring you guys some Pulpizas and you'll see the way.
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.780]  You're coming to America in February for the Olympics, dude.
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:48.340]  Yeah, but I'm, you know, that's a foreign kitchen.
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:48.820]  I don't know.
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:49.520]  We'll have to see.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:53.820]  We have so much to do when we get to Canada that we're going to have to actually go soon.
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.500]  Otherwise, we're going to have to be there for a month.
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.840]  Like we have to get we have to start checking stuff off.
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:01.780]  I haven't figured out how to pack a Pulpiza, but I'll figure it out.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.480]  I'll come up with a way.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:05.360]  Maybe saran wrap?
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:06.400]  That could work.
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:10.920]  God, speaking of food, I came up with an idea for a...
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:14.080]  Actually, I came up with an idea for like a gross food game yesterday.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.180]  And then when I was trying to put it together last night,
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.900]  I pivoted into a totally different idea.
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.540]  But I don't think we have time to do that.
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:21.180]  Yeah, we should.
[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:23.000]  Let's do that in the next episode.
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:25.960]  We can wrap this one up and then we'll start with that one to do.
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:27.620]  How's everybody's balls doing?
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:28.280]  Except for Gavin.
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:28.960]  Way better.
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:29.340]  Kind of fine.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:29.860]  Yeah.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.380]  Mine feel good.
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:37.000]  It feels like when you get done working out and everything is like,
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:38.300]  okay, I can relax now.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.900]  It's like nothing on my body is like scared anymore.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.020]  Everything is okay.
[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:43.580]  Well, there you go.
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.640]  Eric's balls are no longer scared.
[01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:53.100]  And with that, you have completed listening to an episode of the F*** Face Podcast,
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.300]  number 133.
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:56.640]  Not the longest podcast we've ever done.
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:57.760]  Probably not the shortest either.
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:01.120]  But definitely one of the best, maybe.
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:04.740]  And look out for Best of 2022 Supplemental.
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:04.980]  Yep.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:05.880]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.100]  It should be out soon.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.880]  We also have the Fall Draft coming out.
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.560]  I don't know if the pizza videos are out yet or not,
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.580]  but boy, they were entertaining to watch and proof.
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:17.760]  And oh, they are.
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:18.560]  Okay, Eric said they are.
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:20.640]  So go ahead and look for those if you haven't watched them already.
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:23.260]  And don't forget to vote for us in the Academy Awards
[01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:25.000]  or the Grammys or whatever it was.
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:26.420]  And we'll see you next week.
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.980]  Eric, are you putting anything at the end of the pizza video
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:32.120]  or is it just gonna come out?
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.440]  I don't know what you're asking.
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.180]  Okay.
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.320]  There's two, there's two things.
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:39.580]  What are the ends like?
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.660]  You haven't been listening, goodbye!
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:49.000]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.360]  with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:53.660]  Han continues to stun the crew.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.780]  Who puts cucumber in a bag anyway?
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:58.020]  Gavin's CO2 troubles return.
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:00.540]  Geoff talks about his Christmas tiny town.
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:02.180]  Which holiday is the best?
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:05.260]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.200]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
