[00:15.670 --> 00:19.230]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:19.590 --> 00:23.970]  This is number 134, I believe, of season 5.
[00:24.470 --> 00:26.230]  My name is- What the f*** was that?
[00:28.030 --> 00:30.110]  He's gone straight into the bubble, has he?
[00:34.210 --> 00:35.570]  Oh my god.
[00:35.710 --> 00:37.450]  Andrew, it's hot. You gotta take it slow.
[00:38.470 --> 00:40.230]  No, it's lukewarm.
[00:40.230 --> 00:44.630]  Is the Gerpler's a plastic cup? I didn't want to melt the cup.
[00:45.470 --> 00:47.710]  I love the Gerpler too much.
[00:48.130 --> 00:50.910]  Oh, I got beef everywhere.
[00:53.350 --> 00:58.430]  Oh man, ever since Dodge the Bomb, the smell. The smell is so bad.
[01:02.530 --> 01:04.370]  Oh Jesus, okay.
[01:05.150 --> 01:07.650]  Golden F*** Face, how are we doing?
[01:07.650 --> 01:10.130]  I gotta be honest with you, I didn't expect that.
[01:10.410 --> 01:13.730]  Geoff Ramsey, Gavin Free, Andrew Panton, here we are.
[01:14.310 --> 01:16.710]  I was thinking as you were introing, I was like, oh, this will be a nice bit.
[01:16.970 --> 01:18.330]  Nope, it's already happened, nevermind.
[01:20.650 --> 01:22.690]  How is the Bovril? Are you enjoying it?
[01:22.990 --> 01:25.190]  Oh, it's so- I hate it. It's terrible.
[01:25.230 --> 01:27.690]  Why did you agree to chug this again? I don't remember.
[01:27.770 --> 01:33.730]  Yeah, I was like, to celebrate the launch of the Bovril, I'll chug whatever is the most liked response.
[01:34.190 --> 01:35.390]  The launch of the Bovril.
[01:35.550 --> 01:37.150]  The launch of the Bovril.
[01:37.150 --> 01:44.870]  Um, listen. I'm not doing well. I'm not- yeah, I'm beef-brained right now.
[01:46.430 --> 01:49.590]  I like that being something that affects you like brain freeze.
[01:49.930 --> 01:54.150]  I brimleyed it a little bit. I got the- I said the wrong thing.
[01:55.030 --> 01:56.810]  I'm on the ropes here, okay?
[01:57.030 --> 01:59.950]  That's the first use of a brimley in the wild, I love it.
[02:01.490 --> 02:04.450]  Oh man, Jesus Christ.
[02:04.450 --> 02:07.110]  So do you consider yourself a Bovril fan, then?
[02:07.610 --> 02:11.490]  No! What part of that would make you think I was a Bovril fan at all?
[02:11.590 --> 02:12.310]  I don't know, man.
[02:13.010 --> 02:19.110]  I think the Dodge the Bov really tainted it for me. I think in a different- if I would have just tried it normally as intended, I probably would enjoy it.
[02:19.110 --> 02:22.450]  So this is the first time you've had bog-standard lukewarm Bov?
[02:22.490 --> 02:26.810]  Yeah, ever since the Dodge the Bov, I just have been avoiding it at all costs.
[02:26.810 --> 02:31.070]  I can't imagine lukewarm is the preferred temperature to ingest.
[02:31.230 --> 02:36.310]  You could have. I mean, I think the preferred way is to keep you warm on a cold day. It's gotta be steamy.
[02:36.410 --> 02:37.570]  Yeah, it's like piping hot when I-
[02:37.570 --> 02:41.650]  Oh my god. I have so much beef all over me right now.
[02:42.050 --> 02:44.470]  Did you like spit up beef water?
[02:45.090 --> 02:49.070]  Oh, I spit it everywhere. It's everywhere. Oh my god.
[02:51.390 --> 02:53.670]  This is gonna be fun to be in for an hour.
[02:53.910 --> 02:55.170]  Great. This is great.
[02:55.770 --> 02:56.670]  I'm an idiot.
[02:58.430 --> 03:03.530]  Oh hey, real quick, while Andrew's doing that, I got a corndog update.
[03:04.730 --> 03:10.010]  Emily had corndogs for dinner last night. I had zero desire to eat corndogs.
[03:10.130 --> 03:16.350]  Didn't phase me at all. As a matter of fact, I looked at it and thought, what an inferior food, and I ordered a hot dog.
[03:17.090 --> 03:19.730]  And I had a Chicago dog instead.
[03:21.410 --> 03:24.990]  That's awesome. That sounds good. I would always go Chicago dog over corndog.
[03:25.090 --> 03:29.830]  If a nice hot dog was on the table, I would definitely pick that over corndog.
[03:29.870 --> 03:31.630]  I feel like corndog's something to eat if you're in a car.
[03:32.930 --> 03:41.550]  I would say when I was younger, I thought the chili dog was the top tier of all hot dogs, but I've really turned a corner on the Chicago dog.
[03:42.070 --> 03:44.310]  I really think that's the way to go.
[03:44.830 --> 03:46.870]  I feel like I still need to eat it with my hand.
[03:47.330 --> 03:51.790]  And a chili dog sometimes is like a soggy knife and fork situation.
[03:54.650 --> 03:58.550]  Speaking of food, should we get into your exciting food?
[03:58.770 --> 04:01.550]  Geoff dropped us off each a bag of food, I guess.
[04:03.710 --> 04:05.870]  So you were able to get everything on the list, right, Andrew?
[04:06.410 --> 04:07.070]  Yeah, I'm all good.
[04:07.270 --> 04:14.550]  Okay, good. I spent way too much time last night researching products that are for sale in Austin and Canada at large.
[04:15.250 --> 04:17.590]  And this isn't Dubox? This is just food?
[04:18.090 --> 04:20.450]  No, this is a solo food game I came up with.
[04:20.790 --> 04:27.690]  Everybody should have received a bag of a bunch of crap, with the exception of Eric, I think you got a box, because I ran out of grocery bags.
[04:28.110 --> 04:35.830]  So if everybody has their bags ready, I also asked you guys to prepare a pen and a piece of paper, because we're going to write some stuff down.
[04:36.030 --> 04:37.530]  Oh shit, do we? Let me do that.
[04:37.690 --> 04:38.610]  Yeah, it was in the...
[04:38.610 --> 04:39.550]  I'm just seeing the anchos.
[04:42.930 --> 04:45.290]  There you go. Grab your pen and stuff.
[04:45.670 --> 04:47.390]  Yeah, that's fine, we can just fill.
[04:47.890 --> 04:54.190]  I'm so excited about this game, Geoff. I think once we open up and get into it, it's going to be a great time.
[04:54.310 --> 05:01.890]  Yeah, to be... for clarity's sake, Andrew, I bounced some of the ideas off of you last night, and you kind of helped me form it.
[05:02.070 --> 05:07.490]  I had this idea when... I don't remember what we were doing. We were leaving, I guess, work from the office day.
[05:07.490 --> 05:15.350]  And for some reason, I stopped at a store, and I saw these potato chips, and they just looked weird.
[05:15.710 --> 05:19.290]  And I tried them, and it just got me trying to figure out how I could make...
[05:19.290 --> 05:26.790]  Because I knew we have these two episodes we're recording today, and then we have to record one or two more next week, so that we can finish out the year.
[05:26.950 --> 05:28.410]  And so I was just trying to come up with bits.
[05:29.090 --> 05:36.830]  Anyway, I came up with this idea for a gross food thing, but then when I was trying to put it together last night, it made sense to be kind of a different game.
[05:36.830 --> 05:40.630]  And so I'll explain... I don't know if Gavin's still here. I'll kind of explain it as we go.
[05:40.750 --> 05:51.090]  I don't want to give up the entirety of the game, because I think you guys playing along and not quite understanding where we're going with it is going to make it funnier in the end, if that makes sense.
[05:51.590 --> 05:53.790]  And hopefully for the audience, too.
[05:55.790 --> 05:56.190]  Also...
[05:56.190 --> 05:57.690]  Is Gavin in a penless house?
[05:58.110 --> 06:00.190]  I'm back. It was the paper that was the struggle.
[06:00.590 --> 06:04.210]  Also, number one in there is also included.
[06:04.330 --> 06:09.590]  I bought you guys gifts in Michigan when I had my... you know, every year I take my fall Apple trip to Michigan.
[06:10.450 --> 06:18.410]  And when I was there, I got you guys some caramel, I got you guys some hot cider mix, and then I got you guys stickers from the Yates cider mill.
[06:18.510 --> 06:19.970]  So everybody should have those as well.
[06:20.890 --> 06:22.210]  Gavin, you got the best sticker.
[06:22.910 --> 06:28.050]  I didn't realize after I bought them all that there was one that was clearly better than the others, so you got the really good sticker.
[06:30.310 --> 06:32.090]  And that's not because I'm playing favorites.
[06:32.410 --> 06:35.110]  It's just that I've known you longer than everybody else.
[06:35.250 --> 06:36.890]  So I just went with length of time.
[06:37.350 --> 06:41.210]  Okay, so what we have is a bag, except for Eric, who has a little box.
[06:41.650 --> 06:46.170]  And in it are a bunch of different kinds of potato chips and like chippy type things.
[06:46.310 --> 06:55.030]  Now, I don't want to confuse this with the supplemental content we still need to do where I present the chip off, right?
[06:55.030 --> 07:02.590]  Yeah, this is actually going to be called... I'm going to call this the chip-pul-za.
[07:03.170 --> 07:04.310]  The chip-pul-za.
[07:05.130 --> 07:06.150]  The chip-pul-za?
[07:07.070 --> 07:07.990]  The chip-pul-za.
[07:08.210 --> 07:08.870]  The pul-pul-za.
[07:09.030 --> 07:09.590]  The chip-pul-za.
[07:09.670 --> 07:10.710]  Chip-pul-pul-za.
[07:10.830 --> 07:12.030]  A midday chip-pul-za.
[07:12.170 --> 07:13.230]  Midday chip-pul-pul-za.
[07:14.510 --> 07:15.230]  Okay, so...
[07:15.230 --> 07:17.230]  Wow, this is quite the combination of flavors. Jesus.
[07:17.730 --> 07:20.370]  Yeah, well, we're going to be recording your impressions of them.
[07:20.650 --> 07:23.290]  So first off, everybody pull out of the bag. We're going to do this in order.
[07:23.290 --> 07:26.130]  The first thing you'll see is Oncho's, okay?
[07:26.670 --> 07:27.850]  Okay, getting our Oncho's.
[07:28.550 --> 07:34.290]  Sorry, Andrew, you might have Muncho's, because I wasn't able to put painter's tape on yours, obviously, because you had to buy it yourself.
[07:34.750 --> 07:36.110]  Everybody else has Oncho's.
[07:36.810 --> 07:37.190]  I do.
[07:37.250 --> 07:40.970]  I always get paranoid when the price is on the product in print.
[07:40.990 --> 07:42.090]  Really? Why?
[07:42.090 --> 07:43.350]  It's just such a weird thing to me.
[07:43.950 --> 07:44.910]  I feel like it's convenient.
[07:45.310 --> 07:48.650]  That means that they're the same price in every store they're in?
[07:49.690 --> 07:50.090]  Yeah.
[07:50.170 --> 07:50.670]  I guess so.
[07:51.690 --> 07:52.670]  I'm opening them now.
[07:53.050 --> 07:53.370]  Okay.
[07:53.530 --> 07:53.950]  Let's open them.
[07:54.030 --> 07:55.050]  Open up the Oncho's.
[07:55.190 --> 07:58.450]  Before you do it, though, I want you to...
[07:58.450 --> 08:02.690]  What we're going to do is you're going to open it up, and you're going to take your first impressions.
[08:04.250 --> 08:05.470]  We're going to record two numbers.
[08:05.670 --> 08:08.630]  We're going to record from 1 to 5, 1 being the shittiest, 5 being the best.
[08:09.050 --> 08:10.230]  And this will make sense later.
[08:10.650 --> 08:13.390]  Open it up, and I want you to have your pre-taste impression.
[08:13.530 --> 08:14.350]  Just write down a number.
[08:14.670 --> 08:16.030]  It could be 3, it could be whatever.
[08:16.430 --> 08:21.210]  And then you're going to eat a chip, and then after you eat a chip, write down your post-chip impression.
[08:21.210 --> 08:23.710]  And then just combine those two numbers.
[08:23.890 --> 08:26.330]  So if it's 5 and 5, it's 10. If it's 3 and 4, it's 7.
[08:26.590 --> 08:27.270]  Hopefully you get the idea.
[08:27.590 --> 08:30.430]  Pre, post, and first up is...
[08:30.430 --> 08:31.450]  Just write down Oncho's.
[08:33.270 --> 08:38.170]  So you open it up, before we take a bite, write down the number that we have the impression of.
[08:38.470 --> 08:40.850]  And then take a bite, and then give it a number again.
[08:41.250 --> 08:41.850]  Got it.
[08:42.890 --> 08:45.230]  Freshness, appearance, whatever you guys think.
[08:46.410 --> 08:49.230]  Whatever metric you use to evaluate pre-eating.
[08:49.230 --> 08:49.790]  Out of 5?
[08:50.710 --> 08:54.770]  I got the knock-off brand Muncho, so it's a lower score already.
[08:54.990 --> 08:58.270]  Yeah, I'm pittering this at a 4.
[08:58.810 --> 09:01.410]  Okay, they don't have Oncho's in Canada, unfortunately.
[09:02.310 --> 09:05.450]  And then everybody, Nick and Eric, go ahead and write yours down too.
[09:05.650 --> 09:09.270]  And then everybody take a bite from the chips, and then write down your post-score.
[09:09.850 --> 09:10.090]  Okay.
[09:10.970 --> 09:13.650]  I appreciate the audience's patience in this.
[09:13.710 --> 09:16.030]  I know it doesn't quite make sense yet, but I think it'll be funny.
[09:16.190 --> 09:18.190]  Oh dear, that's way saltier than I was expecting.
[09:18.190 --> 09:20.270]  When we put it all together. Interesting. Salty. Okay.
[09:21.030 --> 09:22.690]  That's gone to a 2 for post.
[09:23.910 --> 09:26.770]  I'm gonna say... yeah, I'll agree to that. 2.
[09:27.310 --> 09:27.670]  Oh wow.
[09:29.070 --> 09:32.530]  Okay. Once everybody has recorded their score, let me know and we'll move on.
[09:32.650 --> 09:33.770]  I'm good. I'm ready to move on.
[09:33.830 --> 09:37.190]  And now, I'm gonna... oh, by the way, I will say, there are some...
[09:38.270 --> 09:41.910]  Two things of... and I apologize, I had you by these two, Andrew.
[09:42.270 --> 09:46.950]  There are two things of chocolate. I didn't get that part of the game finished, so just hold on to those.
[09:46.950 --> 09:51.050]  Those will be for the future. I threw them in anyway, just because I figured we'll get to it at some point.
[09:51.570 --> 09:55.690]  So what we have here is we have Terra Sweet and Beet Potato Chips.
[09:56.230 --> 09:59.310]  It's like sweet potatoes and beets. That was what started this whole thing.
[09:59.410 --> 10:07.430]  We have Blue Fuego or Blue Fire Takis, Dill Pickle Kettle Crinkle Cut Potato Chips, Muddy Buddies, which...
[10:07.430 --> 10:11.070]  I don't think Gavin or... I think it's a pretty American thing.
[10:11.090 --> 10:12.090]  I've never heard of a Muddy Buddy.
[10:12.170 --> 10:15.210]  Yeah, I don't think you guys have heard of Muddy Buddies. I'm kind of excited to hear your impressions on those.
[10:15.210 --> 10:19.210]  And then Pork Rinds, Pineapple, and Ancho Chili.
[10:19.890 --> 10:24.950]  Okay, so let's open up that bag of Terra Sweet and Beet Potato Chips next.
[10:25.590 --> 10:28.310]  And then write down your first impression.
[10:31.520 --> 10:36.320]  Oh, gosh. Oh, dear.
[10:37.320 --> 10:38.900]  What is that for?
[10:39.600 --> 10:40.960]  I mean, the pre is not great.
[10:42.940 --> 10:46.180]  What does that mean? Because they're beet potato chips?
[10:46.180 --> 10:48.560]  Did you put a cucumber in this?
[10:51.000 --> 10:53.740]  I got you, you son of a bitch!
[10:55.080 --> 10:58.180]  You've been cucumbered! You've been cucumbered!
[10:59.020 --> 11:00.800]  You didn't even see it!
[11:01.360 --> 11:03.240]  It snuck right in under the radar!
[11:04.960 --> 11:07.120]  You got Trojan Horsed with a cucumber!
[11:07.700 --> 11:09.840]  You fool! You fool, Gavin!
[11:10.020 --> 11:12.740]  Is this whole thing just for me? Are you shitting me?
[11:12.740 --> 11:17.360]  It's just you! You got a bunch of cucumbers in there, buddy!
[11:17.840 --> 11:19.080]  A bunch of cucumbers!
[11:19.520 --> 11:21.000]  How did you do that?
[11:21.380 --> 11:23.200]  You didn't even see it!
[11:23.360 --> 11:24.380]  What do we have here, Gavin?
[11:24.840 --> 11:28.220]  The anchos were a MacGuffin to get your...
[11:28.780 --> 11:34.060]  They were just bog-stained potato chips to get a baseline to trick you.
[11:35.160 --> 11:37.400]  Open up the Takis! Open up the Kettle!
[11:37.740 --> 11:40.280]  Open up the Money Bunnies! Open up the Pork Rinds!
[11:40.280 --> 11:44.780]  And in them you will find pieces of one of the biggest cucumbers on Earth.
[11:45.800 --> 11:47.480]  You are shitting me!
[11:48.080 --> 11:49.980]  I just got a whiff of it!
[11:50.340 --> 11:52.780]  And then I put my hand in and it was wet!
[11:55.760 --> 11:56.400]  Are you serious?
[11:57.140 --> 11:59.360]  This has been in the works for weeks!
[12:00.020 --> 12:00.500]  Weeks!
[12:00.880 --> 12:01.800]  Open up the Takis!
[12:02.340 --> 12:03.720]  Hold on...
[12:04.240 --> 12:09.540]  Hey, Gavin. Myself and Nick received no such box nor bag of any of these chips.
[12:09.540 --> 12:11.480]  It's just me eating chips on my own?
[12:11.560 --> 12:12.140]  It's just... yeah.
[12:13.500 --> 12:19.060]  It was all a cover to get cucumbers on your doorstep without you knowing.
[12:19.380 --> 12:20.140]  And to bring them in.
[12:20.360 --> 12:26.740]  We recorded an entire episode of F*** Face with cucumber next to you and you didn't even know.
[12:26.920 --> 12:32.240]  Yeah, that entire episode of 133, you were cucumber-adjacent the entire time.
[12:32.320 --> 12:33.340]  It was sealed!
[12:34.300 --> 12:35.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[12:35.960 --> 12:37.360]  They're all sealed. Open up!
[12:37.780 --> 12:42.980]  I was wondering why when I picked up each bag, the bottom felt like cold and wet.
[12:45.420 --> 12:47.080]  And I was like...
[12:47.080 --> 12:49.180]  Maybe it's just like the flavors...
[12:49.180 --> 12:52.880]  It like registered but not enough for me to think anything strange was going on.
[12:53.120 --> 12:56.460]  The bottom of the bag is like damp on each one.
[12:56.800 --> 13:00.340]  Andrew, I'll let you... this is your... this was your...
[13:01.240 --> 13:04.380]  How do you... you glued them shut?
[13:04.720 --> 13:06.900]  No, this is... we went on...
[13:07.060 --> 13:10.380]  You have no idea, Gavin, the journey that this has been.
[13:10.500 --> 13:12.260]  There has been failure at every turn.
[13:12.800 --> 13:15.100]  I came up with this a few weeks ago.
[13:15.340 --> 13:17.740]  Shortly after we did, I was thinking, like, how can I...
[13:17.740 --> 13:20.800]  How can I get something on your doorstep without you knowing?
[13:21.100 --> 13:24.260]  And at first I was thinking, like, physically, how could I do it?
[13:24.280 --> 13:26.380]  Because the ring camera, it's gonna be difficult.
[13:26.860 --> 13:28.740]  And then I thought, oh, I can Trojan horse you.
[13:28.740 --> 13:31.640]  I'm gonna put it in something that you're not expecting.
[13:32.180 --> 13:32.880]  That's great.
[13:33.020 --> 13:35.920]  You just, Gavin, just shared cucumbers in another bag of chips.
[13:36.780 --> 13:37.540]  Sneakily in there.
[13:37.980 --> 13:41.500]  So originally, I was... I wanted to do it in a thing of trading cards.
[13:41.900 --> 13:42.580]  You okay?
[13:42.960 --> 13:44.820]  I'm just opening each bag. These ones are blue.
[13:47.800 --> 13:49.080]  Yeah, it's in all of them.
[13:49.640 --> 13:53.100]  So I was gonna do this, and I wanted to do it in Mr. Bean trading cards.
[13:53.220 --> 13:57.780]  And have you open the packs, and every pack would have a slice of cucumber nestled in.
[13:57.780 --> 14:01.820]  And then Geoff brought up, oh, what if we just do it with, like, chips instead?
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.280]  Because that is easier. It makes sense with the thing.
[14:04.560 --> 14:10.200]  And what's even better is Geoff naturally just came up with the double salted licorice.
[14:10.260 --> 14:11.560]  Like, it was a whole part of the show.
[14:11.940 --> 14:15.000]  And that would be the perfect vessel, because you're not expecting anything.
[14:15.040 --> 14:17.240]  It makes sense for you to get it, to have it.
[14:17.440 --> 14:18.960]  So we did the office day.
[14:19.300 --> 14:22.940]  And as soon as we finished recording the office day, I tweeted to Geoff.
[14:22.980 --> 14:25.760]  I bought him a bag resealer off of Amazon.
[14:25.760 --> 14:29.920]  I said, I'm so excited for you to put the cucumber in the licorice.
[14:30.080 --> 14:33.740]  And it's gonna arrive tomorrow. We can get this going.
[14:34.280 --> 14:36.660]  To which Geoff replied, oh no.
[14:37.240 --> 14:39.800]  I gave Gavin the bag of licorice.
[14:40.380 --> 14:46.480]  Geoff completely forgot about our entire plan of using the licorice to get to you.
[14:46.880 --> 14:49.240]  So we had to pivot on the fly.
[14:49.580 --> 14:53.640]  And that whole text conversation you were in was all a ruse.
[14:53.640 --> 14:55.740]  Of us being like, have you tried these chips?
[14:55.960 --> 14:57.580]  I actually love those chips. Those are delicious.
[14:57.840 --> 14:58.360]  They're fucking great.
[14:58.700 --> 14:59.600]  I'm a fan now.
[14:59.600 --> 15:00.240]  They're really tasty.
[15:00.420 --> 15:03.820]  I can't believe the level of deception.
[15:04.740 --> 15:08.640]  So then, you wanna take this, because this is where it escalates.
[15:08.800 --> 15:12.060]  Because my bag resealer kept getting delayed.
[15:12.320 --> 15:13.420]  And it was getting to Geoff on time.
[15:14.020 --> 15:15.200]  You can take this over from this point, Geoff.
[15:15.240 --> 15:19.560]  I was waiting on receiving this tool called a bag resealer.
[15:19.860 --> 15:22.740]  That allows you to open up a bag of potato chips and then reseal it.
[15:22.740 --> 15:24.460]  It heats it shut.
[15:24.960 --> 15:27.180]  And it was out for delivery last night.
[15:27.460 --> 15:29.340]  I had the chips. I was ready to go.
[15:29.500 --> 15:31.020]  Actually, I just had those Terra chips.
[15:31.300 --> 15:32.700]  And I was gonna try to fit it all in that.
[15:33.040 --> 15:35.460]  And then, at like 10pm, Andrew texted me.
[15:35.520 --> 15:37.920]  And he was like, I don't think the resealer is going.
[15:38.600 --> 15:39.980]  It didn't make it to you today.
[15:40.200 --> 15:41.260]  It got sent back to the warehouse.
[15:41.980 --> 15:43.820]  It'll be out tomorrow for delivery.
[15:44.260 --> 15:45.200]  What are we gonna do?
[15:45.340 --> 15:47.360]  And so I hit Google and I started reading.
[15:47.860 --> 15:49.360]  And I found out that you can...
[15:52.180 --> 15:55.400]  Gavin just keeps putting photos from the covers.
[15:55.760 --> 16:02.200]  So I saw on YouTube that you can use like a hair straightener.
[16:02.420 --> 16:04.780]  Like a curling iron. Or like a flat iron is what it's called.
[16:05.420 --> 16:08.040]  A flat iron to reseal a bag of chips.
[16:08.500 --> 16:11.540]  So I went and grabbed Emily's flat iron.
[16:11.840 --> 16:13.220]  By the way, Emily, I'm sorry.
[16:13.420 --> 16:14.900]  I cleaned it. I promise.
[16:15.560 --> 16:17.760]  Things got a little dicey for a moment, but I fixed it.
[16:18.640 --> 16:22.860]  And I started... I took that bag of Tara chips.
[16:23.260 --> 16:24.680]  And I carefully cut it open.
[16:24.800 --> 16:27.080]  And then I tried to reseal it to see if it could be done.
[16:27.400 --> 16:29.820]  And it worked. Kind of.
[16:30.900 --> 16:33.500]  But I did melt some of the bag and stuff.
[16:34.100 --> 16:35.860]  And it wasn't perfect.
[16:36.860 --> 16:39.080]  But then Emily texted me.
[16:39.300 --> 16:40.980]  And she was like...
[16:40.980 --> 16:43.100]  I was like, hey, just letting you know ahead of time.
[16:43.140 --> 16:44.300]  I might have ruined your thing.
[16:44.620 --> 16:45.360]  And she was like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[16:45.360 --> 16:47.400]  Don't you have... because I have a sous-vide.
[16:47.800 --> 16:51.180]  And she was like, don't you have that thing that sucks the air out and then seals it?
[16:51.520 --> 16:52.880]  To put steaks and stuff in.
[16:52.940 --> 16:53.960]  And I was like, oh my god, I do.
[16:54.380 --> 16:56.240]  You don't have to use the air suck thing.
[16:56.300 --> 16:57.400]  You can just use the seal.
[16:57.800 --> 17:00.340]  And so I tried that on a bag of chips and it worked.
[17:00.480 --> 17:02.020]  And I was like, oh my god, this is amazing.
[17:02.240 --> 17:03.060]  It looked professional.
[17:03.700 --> 17:05.920]  So then I started cutting up the cucumber.
[17:06.340 --> 17:10.680]  And as I started to dump it into the bag of beet chips...
[17:10.680 --> 17:14.480]  It made the bag of potato chips weigh like 80 pounds.
[17:14.480 --> 17:25.480]  And I was like, there's no way I'm going to hand him a 27 pound bag of potato chips and have him fall for that.
[17:26.020 --> 17:27.740]  So what I did was...
[17:27.740 --> 17:30.040]  This would have been next to me for like two hours.
[17:30.940 --> 17:35.640]  I sliced up all the cucumbers as thin as I could with a mandolin.
[17:35.840 --> 17:37.860]  Which broke and didn't work worth a damn.
[17:38.100 --> 17:39.560]  So I ended up just kind of half-assing that.
[17:39.560 --> 17:46.480]  And then I put them all in the oven on the lowest setting for like a half an hour to try to evaporate all the water.
[17:46.540 --> 17:49.060]  Because I figured most of the cucumber's water weight, right?
[17:49.400 --> 17:54.840]  So then I got them drier and then I tried to soak and press all the water out to get them as light as possible.
[17:55.120 --> 17:57.700]  Then I realized that still wasn't light enough.
[17:58.000 --> 18:02.540]  So I ran to the store and I bought as many weird kind of potato chips as I could find.
[18:02.980 --> 18:06.280]  All that other stuff I bought like two hours ago.
[18:06.320 --> 18:07.560]  I bought an hour before I went to your house.
[18:07.560 --> 18:10.480]  And I brought it back and then I carefully opened them all up.
[18:10.560 --> 18:12.840]  By the way, I filmed all of this on my phone for you guys.
[18:13.680 --> 18:16.520]  And I filmed it so the angles are terrible.
[18:18.300 --> 18:18.660]  Unusable.
[18:19.120 --> 18:20.240]  Anyway, so I filmed all this.
[18:20.360 --> 18:22.220]  And then I got all the potato chip bags home.
[18:22.340 --> 18:26.600]  I opened them all up. I evenly split out the cucumber into the different bags.
[18:26.800 --> 18:27.960]  We sealed them all.
[18:28.480 --> 18:29.300]  Stuck them in a bag.
[18:29.380 --> 18:32.400]  Was still worried that you weren't going to fall for it.
[18:32.540 --> 18:35.620]  So then I added in the gift of the shit from the apple orchard.
[18:35.620 --> 18:37.360]  Because I've been meaning to give that to you guys for months.
[18:37.740 --> 18:40.160]  As like a combo thing to try to make it all make sense.
[18:40.360 --> 18:45.900]  And then I got on Slack and I said, this is the plan for today.
[18:46.100 --> 18:50.040]  I need to make sure everybody has the same address that they did last time I went to your houses.
[18:50.280 --> 18:52.040]  And then Nick was like, oh no, I moved.
[18:52.240 --> 18:53.640]  And pretended to give me his new address.
[18:53.920 --> 18:58.120]  All as subterfuge to further convince Gavin that this was a real event.
[18:58.640 --> 19:00.760]  Everything surrounding this seemed so legit.
[19:01.780 --> 19:03.300]  I can't believe it.
[19:03.300 --> 19:05.440]  I cannot believe it.
[19:05.880 --> 19:10.120]  Geoff and I were on a Discord call earlier today.
[19:10.360 --> 19:14.180]  Geoff was so giddy showing me all of the bags he had.
[19:14.560 --> 19:15.460]  It was great.
[19:15.600 --> 19:16.880]  I can't wait to see the video.
[19:16.980 --> 19:20.160]  I did a video call with Andrew to show him the whole process and how it worked.
[19:21.020 --> 19:25.400]  This is Andrew's prank, obviously.
[19:25.840 --> 19:29.260]  And I'm just his proxy agent.
[19:29.660 --> 19:32.600]  He clearly gave you the cucumber while he was in Austin, right?
[19:33.220 --> 19:33.580]  Obviously.
[19:34.200 --> 19:36.200]  I also did one dumb thing.
[19:36.420 --> 19:38.920]  I went to the store and I bought...
[19:38.920 --> 19:40.680]  When I bought the cucumbers, I bought three.
[19:41.740 --> 19:43.720]  And as I'm checking out...
[19:43.720 --> 19:46.440]  Actually, as I'm checking out and I'm walking to my car, Andrew texts me.
[19:46.480 --> 19:48.740]  He goes, hey, be sure to get the smallest cucumber they have.
[19:49.000 --> 19:49.960]  It'll be easier to hide.
[19:50.560 --> 19:51.960]  And I went, ah, fuck.
[19:52.040 --> 19:54.560]  I bought the three biggest cucumbers in the store.
[19:55.420 --> 19:56.460]  I don't know why.
[19:57.500 --> 19:58.460]  Yeah, I don't know why you did that either.
[19:58.460 --> 19:59.960]  A big cucumber is funnier.
[19:59.960 --> 20:04.860]  I asked if you put cucumbers in this because they look like really fancy chips.
[20:05.000 --> 20:07.340]  I was like, oh, there's like other veg in here.
[20:07.640 --> 20:09.460]  I really only said that as a joke.
[20:09.580 --> 20:11.860]  And then you were like, yeah, take it.
[20:12.020 --> 20:12.700]  Take the cucumbers.
[20:13.000 --> 20:14.420]  I was like, oh my god.
[20:14.900 --> 20:18.140]  Also, the two things of chocolate.
[20:19.100 --> 20:22.060]  They were there to cover a chocolate bar that didn't work.
[20:22.940 --> 20:24.840]  I took like a gross kind of chocolate.
[20:25.060 --> 20:29.460]  And I got a mandolin and I shaved it down until it was really thin.
[20:29.460 --> 20:30.960]  Except it broke in half.
[20:31.060 --> 20:32.980]  So I had to super glue it back together.
[20:33.120 --> 20:36.560]  When they hide like a flask in a bible or a gun or something.
[20:37.320 --> 20:41.580]  So what I did was I layered the top of the chocolate bar with cucumber.
[20:42.040 --> 20:43.560]  And then sealed it back up.
[20:43.880 --> 20:46.820]  But when I went to go put it in your bag, it had leaked through.
[20:47.060 --> 20:49.080]  And it was very clearly tampered with.
[20:49.300 --> 20:52.020]  So I had to just like pivot and throw that away.
[20:52.680 --> 20:54.260]  Luckily that was from a different cucumber.
[20:55.040 --> 20:55.880]  So good.
[20:55.880 --> 21:00.320]  I had cucumbers in my hands without realizing it.
[21:00.320 --> 21:01.620]  Yeah, dude. Lots of them.
[21:02.140 --> 21:02.800]  Oh my god.
[21:02.920 --> 21:03.220]  So many.
[21:04.260 --> 21:06.760]  By the way, these are my final scores.
[21:11.300 --> 21:13.440]  Geoff, when you showed me the cucumber you bought.
[21:13.540 --> 21:17.100]  It looked like the mallet that like a caveman would have in a cartoon.
[21:17.300 --> 21:19.840]  I've never seen a bigger cucumber in my life.
[21:20.120 --> 21:21.180]  It was massive.
[21:22.320 --> 21:23.600]  Oh, that was so good.
[21:23.600 --> 21:26.660]  Nick said he wasn't sure how far this bit was going.
[21:26.720 --> 21:28.800]  So he was writing down fake numbers.
[21:29.180 --> 21:31.780]  Like if I called for the scores, it would be legit.
[21:33.120 --> 21:38.460]  I have been on pins and needles all fucking day for this moment.
[21:38.740 --> 21:41.640]  Just praying. Praying you would fall for it.
[21:42.240 --> 21:43.620]  The Trojan crisps.
[21:44.100 --> 21:46.340]  Oh, Trojan crisps.
[21:46.920 --> 21:50.560]  So it's what? 1-0. I'm up. I'm on the scoreboard.
[21:50.820 --> 21:52.440]  Yep. I'm ready. Prepared.
[21:52.980 --> 21:55.980]  Don't have my paintball gun anymore, but I got things set up.
[21:56.060 --> 21:59.280]  I should be irritated. I should be frustrated. I'm so impressed.
[21:59.680 --> 22:01.240]  I just can't believe it.
[22:01.740 --> 22:03.560]  And I should just go with my gut.
[22:03.780 --> 22:06.360]  There are a few tiny little things that just registered as like,
[22:06.740 --> 22:08.780]  Oh, that's a bit. And I just didn't follow through.
[22:09.900 --> 22:12.180]  What were they? What were the things that you're like, huh?
[22:12.220 --> 22:16.900]  Well, the first thing that we were doing a crisps bit that somehow isn't the other crisps thing we're doing.
[22:16.980 --> 22:18.700]  I was like, how is this suddenly snuck in?
[22:18.940 --> 22:21.720]  But it didn't register. Like I didn't want to like kill a bit or anything.
[22:21.720 --> 22:23.160]  So I was like, OK, we're doing this.
[22:23.820 --> 22:27.880]  And then like the cold, wet feel of the bags that were just registered,
[22:28.040 --> 22:30.580]  like a little hint of like, oh, that feels a bit weird.
[22:30.600 --> 22:32.840]  I guess I've never had these chips before.
[22:36.120 --> 22:38.680]  I'd also like to point out... It stinks in here, by the way.
[22:38.880 --> 22:41.820]  Gavin, I am an independent agent.
[22:41.960 --> 22:43.900]  I am not aligned with Andrew. I am.
[22:43.940 --> 22:47.540]  I am. I am. I am. I am a free agent available for anybody.
[22:48.620 --> 22:52.560]  I'm just as willing to help you get back at Andrew or Eric.
[22:52.560 --> 22:54.680]  What's your availability towards the end of the month?
[22:55.740 --> 22:57.300]  I'll be available. I'm around.
[22:57.680 --> 23:00.100]  He's a free agent to help you get back at Andrew.
[23:00.200 --> 23:02.760]  The guy we can't go visit, get to in any way.
[23:02.840 --> 23:05.180]  And also he bought a paintball gun for protection.
[23:05.520 --> 23:07.540]  I returned it. I returned it.
[23:07.860 --> 23:09.780]  Yeah. On the record, return the paintball gun.
[23:09.900 --> 23:13.840]  I would just also like to say, even though Geoff is applying his service to you,
[23:13.880 --> 23:16.760]  I'd highly recommend Geoff, Gavin, even though it's against me.
[23:16.760 --> 23:18.800]  Great service. I give it five stars.
[23:18.920 --> 23:19.700]  Really keen? Fantastic.
[23:20.100 --> 23:23.480]  Fun to work with. Just all around. Great, great use of service.
[23:23.500 --> 23:26.760]  Did you by any chance pour an extra bucket of salt into these anchos?
[23:26.840 --> 23:28.160]  Or is that what they taste like?
[23:28.180 --> 23:29.560]  No, that's just what they taste like.
[23:29.660 --> 23:31.900]  The anchos weren't opened or tampered with in any way.
[23:31.980 --> 23:36.140]  They were meant... I just wanted to get a little bit into the joke before the reveal.
[23:36.500 --> 23:37.900]  They were designed for that.
[23:38.440 --> 23:41.880]  And as a hilarious callback to the alphabet contest.
[23:42.780 --> 23:45.360]  Oh, man. That couldn't have gone better.
[23:45.360 --> 23:50.220]  The way that we fell into this being like six bags of chips,
[23:50.400 --> 23:52.400]  it was originally just going to be the bag of licorice.
[23:52.620 --> 23:55.560]  All of the blunders, I feel, just made it better, ultimately.
[23:55.780 --> 24:00.860]  It added... we had to work so much harder to try to sell the deception that was going to occur.
[24:01.060 --> 24:04.820]  I still don't have the bag resealer that Andrew bought me.
[24:04.820 --> 24:06.780]  It should. Actually, it said it was delivered.
[24:06.900 --> 24:08.820]  Oh, it probably was delivered while we were recording.
[24:09.620 --> 24:11.900]  Absolutely. Yeah, it's probably outside your door right now.
[24:12.500 --> 24:14.060]  But your thing was so much better.
[24:14.060 --> 24:16.840]  I love that we... I didn't know you had one of those.
[24:17.260 --> 24:21.380]  It's so much more convenient to use than the little resealer I was sending you.
[24:21.380 --> 24:22.900]  It worked like a charm, too.
[24:23.180 --> 24:23.920]  It worked great.
[24:25.520 --> 24:28.020]  Gavin never noticed the seal. It was the wetness.
[24:28.120 --> 24:30.180]  It was the cold and the wetness that kind of alerted him.
[24:30.260 --> 24:34.080]  There was nothing visually about it, it sounds like, that made you suspicious, Gavin.
[24:34.160 --> 24:35.580]  That they were tampered with.
[24:37.020 --> 24:41.000]  Yeah, they opened pretty easily, but I didn't really think anything of that either.
[24:42.440 --> 24:43.140]  There you go.
[24:43.140 --> 24:46.120]  That was flawless from beginning to end.
[24:47.600 --> 24:50.640]  Gavin, I hate tricking you. I'm sorry, but I had to.
[24:53.640 --> 24:57.640]  So you weren't driving around? You just drove to me and then went home?
[24:58.180 --> 25:03.800]  I should have texted that and said, like, alright, I'm gonna go out and drive to everybody's house now and make the rounds.
[25:03.880 --> 25:07.080]  And then I just sat and played Jim's War for a minute until I thought enough time had passed.
[25:07.260 --> 25:08.780]  And then I just drove to your house and back.
[25:14.680 --> 25:19.440]  So how giddy were you for the entire last recording? Were you just so excited?
[25:19.440 --> 25:24.700]  Oh, it was amazing. I thought we'd get to it pretty fast, and then the episode just kept going and going.
[25:24.780 --> 25:26.900]  And then I thought, it's even funnier if we don't get to it.
[25:27.060 --> 25:29.420]  Are there some in the dipped banana bites?
[25:29.880 --> 25:31.160]  No, they're a MacGuffin too.
[25:31.400 --> 25:31.660]  Okay.
[25:32.120 --> 25:34.800]  Only because I couldn't figure out how to open and reseal that without you seeing it.
[25:34.800 --> 25:36.520]  I was gonna say, because that's like a tear open.
[25:37.020 --> 25:38.200]  Yeah, I couldn't do it.
[25:39.700 --> 25:41.260]  I was like, that wouldn't work.
[25:41.700 --> 25:47.560]  About halfway through the last episode, I realized this is so much funnier if you would record an entire episode without knowing.
[25:48.040 --> 25:53.740]  So I just tried to stretch the cooking thing as long as I could to make sure that we would wrap up and go to the next one.
[25:54.500 --> 25:56.380]  You guys are getting really good at this.
[25:59.220 --> 26:05.000]  I do want to point out that me and Nick were only just asked to play along.
[26:05.100 --> 26:10.460]  Had no idea what was happening or why that it was a cucumber involvement.
[26:10.740 --> 26:15.460]  It was just Geoff going, hey, pretend like you got this.
[26:15.520 --> 26:17.420]  And it was me and Nick going, you got it.
[26:18.900 --> 26:20.800]  No hesitation, no idea why.
[26:21.140 --> 26:25.800]  Yeah, I looped them in with as little information as possible an hour before the podcast started.
[26:25.800 --> 26:27.720]  And just said, cone of silence.
[26:28.340 --> 26:30.280]  I need you guys to just go along with this.
[26:30.420 --> 26:33.620]  I'm telling, pretend that you got this bag.
[26:33.700 --> 26:39.920]  And then I even said, I'm trying to do the Quentin Tarantino thing in Reservoir Dogs where you make the lie so believable.
[26:40.860 --> 26:42.760]  Like when he's talking about pissing with the drug dog.
[26:43.000 --> 26:46.160]  So I was like, Eric, I didn't have a bag for you, so I had to use a box.
[26:46.300 --> 26:49.060]  I was just throwing out bullshit details that make no sense.
[26:49.620 --> 26:57.200]  Yeah, when you go back and listen, I think there's going to be like a lot of little suggestions from us of like what's going to come in our excitement of it.
[26:57.660 --> 27:00.040]  I literally huffed the bag.
[27:00.400 --> 27:01.240]  It smelled weird.
[27:01.380 --> 27:02.580]  And then I looked at the cucumbers.
[27:03.420 --> 27:04.700]  Oh, this is interesting.
[27:09.100 --> 27:10.040]  Oh, my God.
[27:10.100 --> 27:11.580]  I'm so slow on the uptake.
[27:12.060 --> 27:14.400]  Oh, and this went through so many iterations, too.
[27:14.480 --> 27:16.000]  Like there's going to be a real sneaky.
[27:16.000 --> 27:22.180]  I thought about you having something for a while and then doing a fake cucumber thing where I got caught.
[27:22.700 --> 27:25.760]  So you would not expect that you already had the cucumber in your possession.
[27:26.040 --> 27:26.760]  There were layers.
[27:27.100 --> 27:28.960]  This went through a lot of iterations of planning.
[27:29.280 --> 27:32.540]  I was also terrified you would answer the door and I wouldn't be able to keep a straight face.
[27:32.600 --> 27:37.120]  So I was really hoping that I wouldn't run into you when I dropped off the bag.
[27:38.940 --> 27:40.000]  Yeah, you wouldn't have enough.
[27:41.140 --> 27:42.320]  No, I was fucking.
[27:42.460 --> 27:45.340]  I was like I was bouncing off the walls with excitement.
[27:45.340 --> 27:46.860]  There would have been no way to hide it.
[27:47.300 --> 27:52.040]  Do you think there's a glee in just your appearance, Geoff, when leaving it at the door?
[27:53.200 --> 27:55.820]  Do you think there's a visual joy?
[27:56.800 --> 27:57.680]  I tried so hard not to.
[27:57.680 --> 28:02.280]  Devon, you should evaluate that footage and just tell if Geoff seems happier than normal.
[28:03.340 --> 28:04.200]  I blew him a kiss.
[28:04.200 --> 28:06.080]  He usually does something whenever he drops something off.
[28:06.460 --> 28:07.660]  I blew him a kiss on the camera.
[28:08.180 --> 28:13.520]  All right, Gavin Ball's in your court, buddy.
[28:13.520 --> 28:15.900]  And I'm back on the market.
[28:15.900 --> 28:16.860]  Just just for the record.
[28:17.240 --> 28:18.180]  Yeah, contract has ended.
[28:18.500 --> 28:19.200]  Highly recommend.
[28:19.880 --> 28:21.480]  I'm going to be hiring, I think.
[28:23.040 --> 28:29.480]  It stinks of like soggy salt, cucumber and like Vancouver child kick of beer mat.
[28:31.580 --> 28:32.080]  Rug.
[28:32.860 --> 28:34.400]  What's your oxygen level right now?
[28:34.700 --> 28:35.180]  Is that OK?
[28:36.100 --> 28:37.440]  Whatever your scan was before.
[28:37.840 --> 28:38.860]  How are you doing with that?
[28:39.700 --> 28:40.180]  Oh, dear.
[28:40.620 --> 28:42.240]  That might have helped us, actually.
[28:42.240 --> 28:43.060]  It could have.
[28:43.240 --> 28:45.660]  Yeah, maybe that's some of the freshness of the cucumber.
[28:45.820 --> 28:47.220]  Might have affected my intelligence.
[28:49.540 --> 28:49.820]  Oh, no.
[28:50.540 --> 28:51.260]  Is that lethal?
[28:51.360 --> 28:51.680]  Is that high?
[28:51.840 --> 28:52.340]  Is that a lethal amount?
[28:52.640 --> 28:53.400]  That's pretty high.
[28:56.520 --> 28:57.940]  It's 300 outside.
[28:59.060 --> 28:59.440]  Oh, no.
[29:02.020 --> 29:03.620]  You got to get a plant or something.
[29:04.040 --> 29:07.180]  Did you also pump CO2 into my room before you delivered?
[29:08.460 --> 29:08.900]  No.
[29:08.900 --> 29:13.960]  I will say that's the one thing I was bummed about is like the bags deflate when you open them.
[29:14.020 --> 29:19.100]  And I wish that I had like compressed air or something that I could have tried to shoot into it to puff it back up.
[29:19.200 --> 29:21.360]  That'll be how I improve next time.
[29:21.520 --> 29:21.660]  Yeah.
[29:22.040 --> 29:23.300]  Maybe like a bike pump?
[29:23.660 --> 29:23.980]  I don't know.
[29:24.120 --> 29:24.320]  Yeah.
[29:24.600 --> 29:25.800]  Just like a can of compressed air.
[29:25.900 --> 29:28.560]  Just be like, I could seal it up 99% of the way.
[29:28.620 --> 29:32.420]  Just have the little thing, the little tube in there and just like hit it and then seal it.
[29:32.860 --> 29:33.140]  I bet.
[29:34.740 --> 29:35.360]  Oh, man.
[29:35.360 --> 29:40.420]  I thought I was worried with the whole, you know, me taking the photos in Austin with the cucumber.
[29:40.660 --> 29:42.100]  I thought you'd be on high alert, Gavin.
[29:42.420 --> 29:43.880]  So I was worried about that as well.
[29:44.460 --> 29:44.780]  No.
[29:45.120 --> 29:47.360]  I just never for a second expected...
[29:48.720 --> 29:49.760]  That was so good.
[29:50.360 --> 29:51.940]  I ripped my guard was fully down.
[29:53.280 --> 29:55.260]  I wasn't suspicious at all.
[29:56.040 --> 29:56.880]  Oh, man.
[29:57.980 --> 30:00.140]  And would you say that now your guard's going to be higher?
[30:00.640 --> 30:01.500]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[30:01.660 --> 30:02.820]  Because I'm in the lead.
[30:03.080 --> 30:04.380]  I've secured it.
[30:04.380 --> 30:06.020]  We don't have long to go.
[30:06.160 --> 30:10.240]  Plus, we said, I don't remember if this was in the episode or not, or if this is something we talked about later.
[30:10.620 --> 30:14.660]  Any failed attempt, you cannot try again until 10 days later.
[30:14.960 --> 30:18.440]  So you're almost running up to a point where you can only get one attempt.
[30:19.060 --> 30:20.000]  We're getting close.
[30:20.100 --> 30:22.040]  I'm just sneaking an attempt right before Christmas.
[30:24.620 --> 30:25.880]  Unless he's already done it.
[30:27.260 --> 30:27.920]  Unless he's already done it?
[30:27.920 --> 30:29.060]  Yeah, have you checked your door recently?
[30:30.260 --> 30:31.340]  No, I haven't.
[30:31.780 --> 30:33.600]  Not going to, because there's nothing there.
[30:33.760 --> 30:34.500]  Not worried about it.
[30:36.920 --> 30:37.900]  Zero percent chance.
[30:38.300 --> 30:39.940]  I'm going to let everybody know right now.
[30:40.280 --> 30:46.820]  If you send me anything, Geoff, Gavin, for Christmas, it is not entering my home until after the holidays.
[30:47.180 --> 30:50.400]  Everything, I'm viewing every item as a potential cucumber.
[30:51.260 --> 30:52.920]  I'm not doing cucumbers for you, am I?
[30:53.080 --> 30:54.000]  He's doing Monopoly money.
[30:54.000 --> 30:55.060]  No, you're doing Monopoly money.
[30:55.180 --> 30:55.720]  You're right, yeah.
[30:55.900 --> 30:57.300]  That's why I forgot it wasn't a cucumber office.
[30:57.360 --> 30:57.860]  It's Monopoly money.
[30:58.100 --> 31:00.200]  I'm not, oh, fuck, I can't do anything about that, can I?
[31:00.220 --> 31:01.220]  Because you're putting it to the door.
[31:01.220 --> 31:02.220]  There's no stealth.
[31:02.560 --> 31:03.480]  Oh, fuck.
[31:03.660 --> 31:04.880]  Yeah, it's just going to be on your door.
[31:05.280 --> 31:06.680]  It's going to be screwed to your door.
[31:07.500 --> 31:07.860]  Yeah.
[31:08.460 --> 31:10.100]  What were you going to do with the paintball gun?
[31:10.140 --> 31:11.700]  Were you going to shoot the cucumber away?
[31:12.680 --> 31:19.820]  No, I can see the entire lead to my door from a balcony on my room, and I was going to shoot down at him.
[31:19.940 --> 31:20.340]  That makes sense.
[31:20.340 --> 31:21.280]  So I wouldn't have to chase him.
[31:21.640 --> 31:21.800]  Yeah.
[31:22.320 --> 31:23.400]  But then I felt bad about it.
[31:23.520 --> 31:24.160]  So I returned it.
[31:29.630 --> 31:32.190]  No need to stress over the holidays this year.
[31:32.550 --> 31:37.230]  Take a toke break instead of worrying about what to get those impossible to shop for fam members.

[32:48.630 --> 32:50.190]  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[32:50.190 --> 32:57.630]  I know for me personally, when I'm going through something, it's difficult for me to achieve the typical things I can do.
[32:58.090 --> 33:01.830]  It can be just difficult with emotions bogging down. It's a struggle.
[33:02.030 --> 33:05.770]  But working with a therapist can help you get closer to the best version of you.
[33:06.170 --> 33:09.930]  Because when you feel empowered, you're more prepared to take on everything life throws at you.
[33:10.390 --> 33:14.170]  I've talked a lot about in these ads how much therapy has impacted my life.
[33:14.350 --> 33:15.830]  It is something I'd recommend to anyone.
[33:15.830 --> 33:20.550]  It's a wonderful process that can help you in so many ways, at least in my experience.
[33:21.270 --> 33:24.870]  If you're thinking of giving therapy a try, BetterHelp is a great option.

[33:48.690 --> 33:52.890]  This ad is brought to you by Kato's Coffee, which is not Kratos' Coffee.
[33:52.990 --> 33:54.970]  I don't think Kratos would be a coffee drinker.
[33:55.390 --> 33:58.470]  Also, this company is related to dogs in a way that I love.
[33:58.770 --> 34:01.850]  And I don't think Kratos has a dog. I've never played this game. It doesn't really matter.
[34:02.110 --> 34:04.470]  Anyway, Kato's Coffee, great coffee brand.
[34:04.930 --> 34:07.510]  They've got a wide selection of roasts, single origin blends, etc.
[34:07.730 --> 34:11.550]  They offer K-Cups, whole bean bags, and wholesale sizes.
[34:11.550 --> 34:14.930]  They have a patch of coffees for dogs and our customers.
[34:15.750 --> 34:19.910]  Have you been searching for that special pick-me-up, run-of-the-mill store brand, not cutting it?
[34:20.210 --> 34:24.810]  At Kato's Coffee, we have a wide selection of roasts that are sure to tantalize your taste buds.
[34:25.210 --> 34:28.110]  From French roasts to Colombian and everything in between.
[34:28.650 --> 34:35.090]  At Kato's Coffee, we believe perfect roasting and freshness are the keys to revealing what each unique coffee has to offer.
[34:35.590 --> 34:40.810]  Our fresh coffee beans are roasted per order, immediately packaged, and shipped directly to your door.
[34:40.810 --> 34:47.590]  We want our customers to experience fresh coffee at its peak drinkability, just a few days after being roasted to perfection.

[35:01.690 --> 35:07.150]  The Kato's Coffee process reaches completion when you truly taste the coffee's origin and nothing extra.
[35:07.150 --> 35:11.190]  At Kato's Coffee, our passion also includes our furry four-legged friends.
[35:11.550 --> 35:14.630]  That is why we are announcing a partnership with our local animal shelter.
[35:15.050 --> 35:19.610]  For every purchase, we will donate $1 to help our furry little friends find their forever home.
[35:20.030 --> 35:24.190]  If you sign up for our subscription, then every time you order coffee, we will donate $2.
[35:24.910 --> 35:32.790]  Head on over to our website at katoscoffee.com and pick up your bag today using promo code FACE20 for 20% off your order.
[35:34.410 --> 35:40.070]  Well, I, uh, I got nothing else. That's been occupying most of my brain space for the last couple days.
[35:40.630 --> 35:48.110]  Uh, although I will say we did some discussion, we had some discussions about the Gerpler and going forward, gerping forward, uh, what to do.
[35:48.170 --> 35:52.290]  I wanted to, I proposed an idea that we should talk about. Andrew, I believe? I can't remember who I talked to anymore.
[35:52.610 --> 35:53.190]  Yeah, we're talking.
[35:53.230 --> 35:55.130]  Right, right. I wanted to see what you guys thought about this.
[35:55.130 --> 36:05.010]  So, uh, first off, I, you know, a lot of the reason we do the limited merch is because, uh, we can't hold stuff in inventory forever.
[36:05.670 --> 36:14.490]  Uh, and it's, uh, it's expensive to do that. Um, and so we try to do limited runs where we sell out and everybody gets one and then we move on to the next thing.
[36:14.490 --> 36:24.890]  I do think a Gerpler, upon reflection, and especially how much I use it now, it's become like my primary, my primary means of chug is, uh, is through the Gerpler.
[36:25.350 --> 36:35.830]  And, uh, I don't want people to be deprived of the opportunity to get a Gerpler. So I feel like that should be maybe an evergreen product that we always have in store in some way.
[36:35.830 --> 36:41.150]  But because we've already released them, if we're gonna put out another version, I'd like to make them different in some way.
[36:41.650 --> 36:46.110]  Uh, and so we talked about doing a blind box, this is an idea Andrew and I came up with.
[36:46.630 --> 36:53.530]  We talked about doing maybe blind box Gerplers where you could get either a green one or a purple one or maybe some other color.
[36:53.870 --> 36:56.630]  Uh, and it's just like random, you don't know what you get until you open it up.
[36:56.870 --> 37:03.810]  But also, what if there were ten golden Gerplers that are randomly inserted?
[37:03.810 --> 37:12.150]  Uh, because I don't know if you know that, but like, sometimes when you go to Pizza Hut, it's usually a red glass, sometimes it's clear, sometimes it's kind of like a gold color.
[37:12.510 --> 37:21.790]  Like if we could get and release ten golden Gerplers into the wild, super rare, super random, like if we made like a thousand Gerplers, there would be ten.
[37:21.890 --> 37:25.390]  So it'd be very rare, it'd be very low chances of you getting one.
[37:25.770 --> 37:32.890]  But if you drew a golden Gerpler, I was thinking it would be really fun if we included in the bottom of the Gerpler, just like in the glass.
[37:32.890 --> 37:33.330]  Factory tour?
[37:34.930 --> 37:36.010]  Uh, factory tour.
[37:36.250 --> 37:40.070]  That was sort of the thought, yeah, the Charlie, the golden ticket is definitely an inspiration for that.
[37:40.070 --> 37:53.070]  I was, I referred to it as the Wu-Tang album that Martin Shkreli bought, but what if it includes in the golden Gerp a little USB drive that has a special like ten minute episode of f***face that only exists on that drive.
[37:53.450 --> 37:55.670]  And you can only get it by getting the golden Gerpler.
[37:57.530 --> 37:58.890]  I like the idea.
[37:58.930 --> 38:01.170]  That's such a ridiculously custom piece of content.
[38:01.170 --> 38:07.810]  Yeah, and then it's like if the people who get it want to upload it, that's fine, it's their content, they can do whatever the f*** they want to with it.
[38:07.850 --> 38:18.470]  They can release it if they want to and share it with the world, or they can hold on to it, and you got like a one in ten chance of like if somebody gets it, you know, you got ten options, or ten opportunities for people to release it if they want to.
[38:18.690 --> 38:26.270]  And then it would be like non-canon, it could just even be about, it could be about, who knows, we could come up with something, we could even do like a little scripted thing or whatever.
[38:26.270 --> 38:32.890]  But it would just be like a special treat if you draw the golden Gerpler, you get with it a special episode of...
[38:32.890 --> 38:33.970]  Should it be on cassette or something?
[38:34.670 --> 38:37.730]  Could be, could be. We could do 8-track cassette, whatever.
[38:41.170 --> 38:41.970]  Golden Gerpler.
[38:42.770 --> 38:49.270]  It's gonna be so stupid. I want, I just want them available at all times because I would love to replace every cup I have with the Gerpler.
[38:49.650 --> 38:52.930]  I love it so much. It is, as you said, Geoff, it has become my primary cup.
[38:53.070 --> 38:53.170]  Yeah.
[38:53.290 --> 38:53.930]  It's fantastic.
[38:54.330 --> 38:56.650]  So I think we should do the soda chug from them.
[38:58.070 --> 39:00.670]  Yeah, definitely. We need to do that as well. Maybe next time?
[39:00.730 --> 39:01.690]  We'll do it this time if you want.
[39:01.790 --> 39:03.190]  I mean, yeah, you've got one already.
[39:03.790 --> 39:06.070]  Well, I do, but I don't... I have a can of soda.
[39:06.510 --> 39:08.190]  You have to have a can of soda in your house.
[39:08.690 --> 39:09.610]  I don't know if I do.
[39:09.770 --> 39:10.470]  Come on!
[39:11.190 --> 39:13.670]  I might. I'll look. Give me one second.
[39:13.970 --> 39:14.730]  Eric, do you have one?
[39:15.030 --> 39:16.450]  Do I have a can of soda?
[39:16.850 --> 39:17.470]  Or a Gerpler?
[39:18.150 --> 39:21.410]  Uh, I don't think I have a Gerpler here, but I do have a can of soda.
[39:22.390 --> 39:23.870]  Well, I mean, we've done that.
[39:24.670 --> 39:25.910]  All right. Sorry, man.
[39:27.570 --> 39:29.610]  Did you participate last time?
[39:30.530 --> 39:31.070]  Uh, yeah.
[39:31.370 --> 39:32.190]  Yeah, everyone did.
[39:32.190 --> 39:32.790]  We did beer.
[39:32.890 --> 39:34.230]  Yeah, okay. So there's no reason to do that again.
[39:34.770 --> 39:34.910]  Yeah.
[39:35.190 --> 39:35.490]  Right.
[39:37.810 --> 39:41.150]  I don't... I don't think I have any soda right now.
[39:41.210 --> 39:41.730]  That's mind-blowing.
[39:41.830 --> 39:42.170]  But I'll get one.
[39:43.090 --> 39:44.690]  Why? Am I a soda guy to you?
[39:45.070 --> 39:46.030]  Oh, yeah, big time.
[39:46.470 --> 39:47.150]  Yeah, I mean, really.
[39:47.530 --> 39:49.150]  Yeah, you seem like a soda guy to me.
[39:49.450 --> 39:49.790]  Totally do.
[39:50.010 --> 39:50.330]  Fascinating.
[39:51.430 --> 39:52.230]  I don't.
[39:52.830 --> 39:56.410]  I'm looking at an empty can of Coke on my desk from last night.
[39:56.590 --> 39:57.570]  Okay, so...
[39:57.570 --> 39:58.010]  A trick.
[39:58.110 --> 39:59.010]  So you are a soda guy?
[39:59.590 --> 40:00.970]  Yeah, I guess I am. Yeah.
[40:01.130 --> 40:01.310]  Okay.
[40:01.570 --> 40:05.010]  I enjoy... I'd say I'm more a beverage guy than a soda guy.
[40:05.270 --> 40:08.890]  So, we all said you were a soda guy, and you were, like, so taken back by it.
[40:09.210 --> 40:11.690]  And now it's like, oh, yeah, I'm a soda guy. What?
[40:12.030 --> 40:15.490]  Well, that I would have... always have a soda on hand is what was...
[40:15.490 --> 40:16.050]  You've got one...
[40:16.050 --> 40:16.930]  I don't think that's true.
[40:16.950 --> 40:18.510]  On a different floor, I do know it.
[40:19.550 --> 40:20.090]  No, I don't.
[40:20.090 --> 40:21.290]  I know you don't like changing floors.
[40:22.150 --> 40:22.710]  No, I don't.
[40:22.890 --> 40:23.430]  So that...
[40:23.430 --> 40:23.870]  Listen, I got...
[40:23.870 --> 40:26.930]  That empty Coke can, that was the last soda in your house last night?
[40:27.570 --> 40:27.990]  That was the last one, yeah.
[40:27.990 --> 40:29.190]  We missed it by 12 hours?
[40:29.810 --> 40:33.430]  We missed it by 12 hours, and I'm an idiot because I talked about doing it prior to.
[40:33.490 --> 40:34.810]  I shouldn't have drank that. I should have saved it.
[40:34.870 --> 40:37.630]  I mean, we could start with Geoff today and each do one in a different episode.
[40:38.290 --> 40:39.690]  Like, I can do one when I get my gurp.
[40:39.990 --> 40:40.730]  Ooh, that's a fun idea.
[40:41.630 --> 40:43.550]  You think so? But then it's like, we're dragging...
[40:43.550 --> 40:46.270]  I don't want it to be, like, the icy hot thing where we do it, like, four times.
[40:46.490 --> 40:47.090]  Like, I'd rather just all do it at once.
[40:47.090 --> 40:48.790]  Or like the soda chug that we did four times.
[40:48.790 --> 40:50.750]  Yeah, like, we've already done this.
[40:50.930 --> 40:52.430]  I don't think we need eight of these.
[40:53.350 --> 40:54.950]  I'd rather sync up, if that's okay.
[40:54.990 --> 40:55.790]  That's fair, that's fair.
[40:55.910 --> 40:57.210]  Alright, so we'll all...
[40:57.210 --> 40:57.650]  Let's go official.
[40:58.350 --> 41:02.570]  Does everybody have access to a gurpler that they can have available next time?
[41:02.730 --> 41:03.270]  I don't have one.
[41:03.710 --> 41:05.030]  What are you talking about?
[41:05.470 --> 41:05.870]  What?
[41:05.870 --> 41:06.870]  How do you not have one?
[41:07.330 --> 41:08.550]  You're leading this.
[41:08.930 --> 41:10.050]  You don't have a gurpler.
[41:10.110 --> 41:10.450]  No, I've never had one.
[41:10.470 --> 41:11.370]  What are you saying?
[41:11.770 --> 41:13.090]  I don't have any of the recent stuff.
[41:13.550 --> 41:15.450]  Dude, go to work and get your mail.
[41:15.670 --> 41:18.150]  It's at the office waiting for you. I guarantee you it's in the mail.
[41:18.150 --> 41:19.350]  I assure you it's not.
[41:19.850 --> 41:20.870]  It has to be.
[41:20.970 --> 41:21.450]  It has to be.
[41:21.710 --> 41:23.710]  After every podcast I go in there, there's nothing.
[41:24.090 --> 41:25.630]  Didn't we do this?
[41:26.170 --> 41:28.210]  I do, but it's because you put it in my hand and gave it to me.
[41:28.590 --> 41:29.690]  Oh, that's right, I did.
[41:29.970 --> 41:31.110]  With a bunch of licorice.
[41:31.690 --> 41:35.030]  I feel like we went through this in the past where you're like, ah, nothing, nowhere.
[41:35.250 --> 41:36.410]  The mail, I never get it anywhere.
[41:36.530 --> 41:39.790]  And then Eric brought you like 25 bags of f*** face merch.
[41:40.130 --> 41:40.330]  Yeah.
[41:41.010 --> 41:42.010]  I think we've done this.
[41:42.010 --> 41:42.410]  It's there.
[41:43.330 --> 41:46.890]  It's just like Andrew, who is not a soda guy, but has a soda.
[41:47.330 --> 41:49.530]  Gavin doesn't get any of the merch, but he gets all the merch.
[41:49.870 --> 41:50.050]  Alright.
[41:50.530 --> 41:52.450]  Look, I haven't got any merch since that big haul.
[41:53.310 --> 41:54.630]  Are you saying there's another big pile?
[41:55.370 --> 41:56.110]  Of course!
[41:56.470 --> 41:57.050]  What do you mean?
[41:57.090 --> 41:57.770]  Where is it though?
[41:57.810 --> 41:59.110]  Because I go in there every week.
[42:00.190 --> 42:03.570]  Walk in, look to the right, find your name, it's written out.
[42:04.030 --> 42:05.290]  There's nothing by my name.
[42:07.150 --> 42:07.670]  Tellin' ya.
[42:08.910 --> 42:10.470]  Dude, I don't even...
[42:10.470 --> 42:11.450]  Mine's worse.
[42:11.930 --> 42:16.450]  I get a notification from Slack every time I get a piece of mail addressed to me,
[42:16.530 --> 42:19.250]  and then I go into that room, and there is no Geoff section.
[42:19.670 --> 42:22.850]  There's a f*** face section, and I leave it there until we're gonna do a break shit or whatever,
[42:22.970 --> 42:23.590]  and then we grab it all.
[42:23.810 --> 42:27.350]  But the Geoff section doesn't exist, and I've never seen the Geoff mail.
[42:27.490 --> 42:29.290]  I don't know where it goes, but it doesn't go to me.
[42:30.350 --> 42:32.030]  Maybe they're keeping our stuff aside somewhere.
[42:32.690 --> 42:36.570]  I'm looking at the text conversation that we all had on Tuesday night.
[42:36.630 --> 42:36.830]  Yeah.
[42:37.150 --> 42:37.930]  Or Tuesday afternoon.
[42:38.430 --> 42:39.350]  It's so long.
[42:39.350 --> 42:41.550]  Just to set up doing the chip thing.
[42:42.530 --> 42:44.850]  It starts with you saying, are either of you Beats guys?
[42:45.170 --> 42:47.290]  So you could specifically talk about those Terra chips.
[42:47.930 --> 42:48.010]  Yeah.
[42:48.150 --> 42:50.350]  What was the text conversation right before that?
[42:50.370 --> 42:51.130]  Why don't you run through it?
[42:52.490 --> 42:53.770]  I mean, we could all play our parts.
[42:54.210 --> 42:54.570]  Okay.
[42:54.810 --> 42:57.070]  Well, I'll just say, before you even get that,
[42:57.150 --> 43:01.850]  our text between Geoff and I figuring out, like, what chips sound weird that you wouldn't have had.
[43:02.150 --> 43:04.710]  Do you wanna read your messages out, and then we'll read the other one?
[43:04.910 --> 43:05.250]  Sure.
[43:05.530 --> 43:06.070]  We can do that.
[43:06.170 --> 43:07.150]  Let me pull up my phone.
[43:07.150 --> 43:10.890]  And just remember, people listening, just remember, all of this is bollocks.
[43:11.710 --> 43:13.430]  Yeah, this was just to fuck with you.
[43:14.770 --> 43:15.710]  Can't believe it.
[43:16.430 --> 43:17.530]  I'm gonna start here.
[43:17.570 --> 43:19.210]  My paranoia really dipped.
[43:19.590 --> 43:21.490]  It's crazy how just time will do that.
[43:22.050 --> 43:23.070]  I'm gonna start here.
[43:23.850 --> 43:26.010]  The resealer arrives at your place tomorrow.
[43:26.290 --> 43:29.190]  We could hit Gavin with his cucumber and licorice bag on Thursday.
[43:29.850 --> 43:30.790]  Okay, okay, okay, yeah, yeah.
[43:30.930 --> 43:32.630]  I go, yeah, dude. Oh, shit.
[43:33.030 --> 43:33.810]  I'm so excited.
[43:34.490 --> 43:35.710]  I gave it to him today.
[43:35.850 --> 43:36.770]  Eric told me to.
[43:36.770 --> 43:37.690]  Ah, I forgot.
[43:38.430 --> 43:40.190]  What, why, how, Geoff?
[43:41.390 --> 43:42.110]  I'm so dumb.
[43:43.290 --> 43:45.090]  I was distracted with the fireplace talk.
[43:46.090 --> 43:47.250]  This is just a wrinkle.
[43:48.050 --> 43:49.870]  So now, and just for context to this comment,
[43:50.510 --> 43:53.530]  we almost did the licorice thing on the office day,
[43:53.610 --> 43:56.410]  and I kept being like, no, later, later, we'll do it later, we'll do it later,
[43:56.450 --> 43:58.390]  because that was the whole, that was gonna be the vessel.
[43:59.070 --> 44:00.730]  That's why I kept pushing it to do it later.
[44:01.190 --> 44:02.830]  And I went, yeah, that makes sense.
[44:03.470 --> 44:05.830]  You were like, oh, it should be in an episode, it should be in an episode.
[44:07.970 --> 44:10.830]  Whenever you have a strong opinion, I should be suspicious.
[44:11.650 --> 44:13.270]  Hey, why didn't you want to chug soda today?
[44:14.610 --> 44:15.430]  Oh, that's a good point.
[44:17.050 --> 44:18.650]  Andrew said, that's so funny.
[44:18.730 --> 44:20.890]  And I said, I'm so mad at myself.
[44:21.490 --> 44:23.070]  What is another candy or chip?
[44:23.530 --> 44:27.230]  And I said, there are so many bits we have in the air to remember at all times.
[44:27.690 --> 44:28.930]  This could be a real easy fix.
[44:29.270 --> 44:31.650]  And I said, we'll be together again for the fireplace.
[44:31.910 --> 44:34.070]  I could sneak something into his camera bag.
[44:34.330 --> 44:35.690]  No, it has to be on his porch.
[44:35.690 --> 44:36.890]  Do you have a cucumber?
[44:37.510 --> 44:39.750]  And I said, I have an idea. I'm gonna go buy one now.
[44:40.610 --> 44:44.010]  Well, getting one, maybe pop into the chip or candy aisle and look for something disgusting.
[44:44.470 --> 44:46.090]  Doing so. Oh, one other thing.
[44:46.650 --> 44:49.010]  I gave everyone apple-related gifts in Michigan.
[44:49.150 --> 44:52.710]  I can drop those off on his door too and pretend it's a part of the whole deal.
[44:53.270 --> 44:56.690]  Then I could say in our group text, I found something that might be worse than the licorice.
[44:56.770 --> 44:59.130]  And you could be like, I'm literally grocery shopping right now.
[44:59.170 --> 45:00.350]  I'll pick one up for you, Gavin.
[45:02.310 --> 45:07.590]  And then I sent him a picture of cucumbers, and then the banana thing, and then the taro chips.
[45:08.390 --> 45:13.650]  Geoff sent me a photo of cucumbers, and I replied, I'd go with the smallest, which he completely ignored.
[45:14.050 --> 45:15.830]  I just missed it. Yeah, I missed it.
[45:18.490 --> 45:22.490]  And you said the problem is the seal. I don't think we can fake a resealable bag.
[45:22.990 --> 45:27.110]  Yeah, that's sort of the heart of it. And then we could go back to now our group text.
[45:27.610 --> 45:29.050]  Yeah, and then the group text.
[45:29.050 --> 45:32.770]  That's going to take forever to scroll through. I don't know if this is, is this entertaining to go through these?
[45:33.530 --> 45:40.130]  Well, I think it puts out the extent of bullshit that you've laid down, like the tracks of shite.
[45:40.670 --> 45:45.610]  Yeah, and then, yeah, this was just the three of us. It didn't have Eric or Nick in it at all, which is why they didn't know about it.
[45:46.990 --> 45:49.750]  It starts with Andrews, either of you beats guys?
[45:50.150 --> 45:51.650]  Yeah, are either of you beats guys?
[45:52.350 --> 45:52.670]  No.
[45:53.050 --> 45:55.610]  When you said no, I was so excited, Gavin. That's like, fuck yeah.
[45:56.850 --> 45:58.610]  I'm still waiting for mine to load.
[45:58.910 --> 46:05.610]  Just said, I love beats. I said, I just had the worst chip of my life. And I know I haven't tried the licorice, but you guys got to try this.
[46:07.690 --> 46:12.530]  And I said, I love beats. I had beats. Oh, no, I see. Yeah, I said, are they like potato chips?
[46:13.770 --> 46:15.030]  Meanwhile, I had already bought them.
[46:15.790 --> 46:17.610]  Yeah, it's like slice dried beet with seasoning.
[46:18.190 --> 46:21.170]  And I said, have you guys ever eaten enough beets to turn your pee red?
[46:21.950 --> 46:23.630]  No, but I didn't expect more pee research.
[46:24.670 --> 46:30.770]  And I said, we should have a red pee off someday, which I still agree with. I see like how red we can make our pee by eating a bunch of beets.
[46:31.190 --> 46:34.450]  I still have the same issue. I don't know how we track that and measure it and share it.
[46:34.610 --> 46:38.310]  I don't know. I don't want to see your pee, though.
[46:38.570 --> 46:40.290]  Well, it looks like red blood. It won't look like pee.
[46:41.690 --> 46:42.790]  That makes it better.
[46:43.130 --> 46:44.330]  I have a clean toilet. It'll be fine.
[46:44.690 --> 46:46.510]  No, I'd rather not see your blood or pee.
[46:48.070 --> 46:51.810]  And then I pulled a screen grab of the chips that just showed me and I said, it's these fucking things.
[46:51.930 --> 46:55.430]  I like other tarot chips, but those are absolute garbage. I love all tarot chips. They're all great.
[46:56.490 --> 47:01.070]  And I said, I'll try to grab some later today. I got to go. Yeah, Millie was sick.
[47:01.130 --> 47:03.010]  So I said, I got to go to the store to get her some chicken soup anyway.
[47:04.350 --> 47:07.770]  You said sounds good. I said, let me know if anyone has any other gross foods to get.
[47:07.850 --> 47:10.550]  I'm trying to get Gavin engaged in the conversation.
[47:10.830 --> 47:15.130]  Because I figure when he starts responding, we'll have him on the hook and then we can burrow in.
[47:15.130 --> 47:19.490]  For ages, my phone was going apeshit and I just looked at it right at the end of the conversation.
[47:20.250 --> 47:24.930]  So I'm like fishing and I said, like, what do you guys think the strongest flavors are? Probably cheese.
[47:25.090 --> 47:32.190]  And then we had this whole conversation about garlic and cheese and versatile foods.
[47:32.330 --> 47:33.790]  This goes on for a while.
[47:34.310 --> 47:35.830]  Buffalo sauce. And then I said anchovy.
[47:36.250 --> 47:40.310]  Then you fucking, you showed up and then it was gone.
[47:42.310 --> 47:45.170]  I said olives are first. And then we had a whole conversation about...
[47:45.170 --> 47:46.290]  It was a whole thing.
[47:46.370 --> 47:51.310]  Then I pivoted. My goal was to keep it going in different directions so it didn't feel too focused.
[47:52.130 --> 47:57.410]  So, like, I got off on muffuletta sandwiches for a while, which you guys have never had, but they're fucking delicious, by the way.
[47:57.430 --> 47:57.910]  No, I've had one.
[47:58.630 --> 48:00.610]  They're amazing. Fuck you.
[48:02.790 --> 48:04.070]  That was so genuine.
[48:06.090 --> 48:08.310]  Yeah, and then that went on for a long, long time.
[48:08.310 --> 48:10.870]  You said the muffuletta is the worst sandwich on the planet. I was offended.
[48:11.090 --> 48:12.850]  And then you ate cucumbers.
[48:13.270 --> 48:13.810]  Fantastic.
[48:14.450 --> 48:16.050]  Cucumbers on my porch.
[48:17.610 --> 48:20.090]  In your hands. In your room.
[48:20.430 --> 48:21.110]  You carried them up.
[48:21.110 --> 48:22.110]  On my lap.
[48:22.530 --> 48:24.710]  On your lap. Sitting there.
[48:24.990 --> 48:27.690]  Cold. And slightly damp against my lap.
[48:28.350 --> 48:37.070]  That's interesting because the problem I had earlier was that the bags got real hot because I cooked them in the oven for like 30 minutes.
[48:37.070 --> 48:39.970]  And I thought, oh my god, these bags are hot. He's never going to believe me.
[48:40.950 --> 48:42.310]  I'm glad they cooled down.
[48:42.810 --> 48:46.170]  Nothing suspicious about these hot bag of chips I'm leaving on your front door.
[48:46.450 --> 48:49.790]  I can just imagine the steam coming off of them when he opens it.
[48:50.810 --> 48:53.430]  They're like fanning them and blowing on them on my doorstep.
[48:56.870 --> 48:59.350]  That was great. Thank you so much for your help, Geoff.
[48:59.850 --> 49:02.810]  What a fantastic series of events.
[49:03.070 --> 49:04.930]  Yeah, that turned out really well.
[49:04.930 --> 49:08.070]  That was the exact opposite of a salad cream. For sure.
[49:08.850 --> 49:10.670]  Couldn't have been further from salad cream.
[49:11.090 --> 49:13.630]  100%. I don't know what the opposite of a salad cream is.
[49:13.950 --> 49:15.070]  Have we ever determined that?
[49:15.170 --> 49:15.990]  No, I don't think so.
[49:16.430 --> 49:17.210]  We can add.
[49:17.510 --> 49:19.230]  Maybe that's what this is. You chipped it.
[49:19.670 --> 49:22.330]  You chipped it? I think we could have worked it.
[49:22.730 --> 49:24.170]  We'll workshop it.
[49:24.510 --> 49:24.990]  Absolutely.
[49:25.770 --> 49:27.270]  What else you guys got going on?
[49:27.650 --> 49:33.790]  Not much. I'm on the fence about going into the process of the cucumber photos.
[49:33.790 --> 49:38.210]  But I don't know if I should wait to go into detail on that whole saga.
[49:38.870 --> 49:42.970]  Because it's kind of nice because the cucumber... there might be a last act.
[49:43.010 --> 49:45.910]  Maybe I should save it. Should I save it or should I go into it? I don't know.
[49:46.050 --> 49:49.610]  I think there's going to be a last act if Gavin's going to try to enact revenge on you.
[49:50.290 --> 49:53.950]  I mean, you... it seems that you both don't think I was in Austin.
[49:54.350 --> 49:56.890]  Like, definitively. You both strongly believe that.
[49:57.310 --> 49:59.950]  Don't say both. I think there's four of us here that don't think you were in Austin.
[49:59.950 --> 50:02.010]  Nobody here thinks I was in Austin?
[50:02.890 --> 50:06.070]  The forensics were done. None of you? Just to verify, nobody thinks I was in Austin?
[50:06.770 --> 50:06.970]  Yep.
[50:08.390 --> 50:14.210]  So then, how would I have gotten the photos? What would be the... where did they leave them?
[50:14.210 --> 50:22.530]  I don't understand. Like, you're the only person that can hold up a cucumber at the Austin sign?
[50:23.090 --> 50:30.090]  Okay, so I was just... so the thing would be that I wasn't there, but I had somebody in my place.
[50:30.650 --> 50:34.190]  Yeah, no... yeah, the way that... are you joking?
[50:34.810 --> 50:37.990]  I'm just asking. This has been a very angry year for Eric.
[50:38.230 --> 50:46.230]  This is insane. Because it is... because it's so... this is, like, so insulting to our intelligence.
[50:46.310 --> 50:50.230]  I like the fact that Eric clearly hasn't known Andrew for as long as we have.
[50:50.230 --> 50:52.490]  So we just expect this guy...
[50:52.490 --> 50:52.950]  Wild!
[50:53.010 --> 50:53.550]  Just asking.
[50:54.070 --> 50:57.850]  Oh, so yeah, oh, how do you guys think I did this?
[50:58.090 --> 51:03.750]  Eric's just curious. He's just curious, and he's just gonna dump something in the chat. Just let him do it.
[51:04.070 --> 51:06.890]  No, I don't have anything to drop in the chat. I was just trying to decide...
[51:07.850 --> 51:11.150]  I thought you were... I really thought you were keying up to drop something in the chat.
[51:11.550 --> 51:12.230]  No, yeah, there's...
[51:12.230 --> 51:13.450]  What are you gonna drop in the chat?
[51:13.950 --> 51:18.050]  I don't know what they thought I was gonna drop in the chat. I have nothing to drop in the chat.
[51:18.050 --> 51:19.970]  I thought you were gonna drop a...
[51:20.530 --> 51:22.690]  Photoshopped into someone else's picture and asked him.
[51:22.710 --> 51:31.130]  Should I just... because it was a whole... I need to... I'm not gonna just reveal because it... okay. I'll say... this is what I'm gonna do.
[51:31.870 --> 51:39.130]  I can't imagine... I can't imagine being a listener of this podcast and having to listen to what Andrew is saying right now.
[51:39.450 --> 51:43.950]  Like, people have to be screaming at their phones. They have to be. They have to be.
[51:43.950 --> 51:48.250]  There's no way that people are just going, ah... and I'll wait patiently for the answer.
[51:48.550 --> 51:51.730]  People must be fucking screaming at their phones.
[51:52.410 --> 51:54.190]  I think everyone's happy, first of all.
[51:55.650 --> 51:56.810]  I'm in a great mood.
[51:57.150 --> 51:58.110]  They're screaming with joy.
[51:58.830 --> 52:00.750]  Yeah, this has been a lot of fun.
[52:01.170 --> 52:05.710]  I don't feel... I was... I'll say I wasn't an Austin, sadly. I wish I was.
[52:06.270 --> 52:11.030]  I don't wanna give up the person who assisted me with this unless I know they're okay with it.
[52:11.030 --> 52:13.570]  So I'm gonna have to... I'll slack them and I'll get back to you guys.
[52:13.570 --> 52:16.890]  Well, by saying slack, you tell us who it was.
[52:17.750 --> 52:18.950]  Someone who works for us.
[52:19.110 --> 52:19.330]  No.
[52:20.330 --> 52:20.730]  Yeah.
[52:21.450 --> 52:22.410]  No, I use...
[52:22.410 --> 52:24.530]  It was clearly... I bet it was fucking Jack is who it was.
[52:24.610 --> 52:28.890]  Go back and listen... whenever I... I always use slack to refer to messaging someone.
[52:29.650 --> 52:31.790]  Whenever I... go back and... the audience will back me up on this.
[52:31.790 --> 52:32.950]  Especially when you're using slack.
[52:33.470 --> 52:33.750]  Yeah.
[52:34.090 --> 52:34.570]  The audience...
[52:34.570 --> 52:36.990]  Ah, I slacked someone. You know, the way that's...
[52:36.990 --> 52:37.090]  No, no, no.
[52:37.090 --> 52:39.910]  When we're chatting, when I'm sending a text, you know the way I say I slacked you.
[52:40.030 --> 52:43.550]  Yeah, whenever I text someone, I'm always like, I slacked them. That's a thing I do.
[52:43.550 --> 52:46.530]  I'm trying to see... there's no... there's no hand skin.
[52:47.010 --> 52:47.470]  That's a thing.
[52:47.670 --> 52:48.630]  In any of these pictures.
[52:49.250 --> 52:49.350]  Deliberately.
[52:49.350 --> 52:53.250]  I want to see Andrew dig himself out of this bean hole he's just put himself in.
[52:53.650 --> 52:57.070]  No, I... I... you know, I use slack as message all the time.
[52:57.230 --> 52:57.450]  I think...
[52:57.450 --> 52:58.670]  It doesn't have to be slack.
[52:58.850 --> 52:59.130]  No, you...
[52:59.130 --> 53:03.390]  I think someone is hiding their hands because they know that you can recognize someone by their hands.
[53:04.170 --> 53:06.430]  We're just going to move on. It's fine. We'll talk about this later.
[53:06.530 --> 53:08.050]  This is the worst.
[53:08.050 --> 53:13.710]  Slack them about it and then in a general sense, not necessarily use the platform slack.
[53:13.870 --> 53:16.670]  And then if I get approval, I'll say who it was.
[53:16.730 --> 53:18.770]  Was it Greg from finance?
[53:19.570 --> 53:22.070]  No, I don't... I'll say it's not Greg from finance.
[53:23.250 --> 53:26.290]  They might not even be on our slack. It's, you know, I use...
[53:26.290 --> 53:31.430]  Wait, hang on, hang on. So now it's on slack, just not on our slack.
[53:32.530 --> 53:35.210]  Uh, no, I don't have any other slacks.
[53:35.250 --> 53:35.930]  This sucks.
[53:35.930 --> 53:39.490]  Well, maybe I do. Actually, wait, maybe I do have multiple slacks. Wait a second.
[53:39.710 --> 53:42.990]  After all that build up, you don't even have this ready to go. You got to talk to someone.
[53:43.750 --> 53:48.570]  Well, I didn't plan on... I didn't know where... I didn't listen to the research that was done.
[53:48.630 --> 53:51.230]  I didn't know where everyone was at with it. I wanted to feel the room.
[53:51.290 --> 53:55.370]  And obviously, there's a sense I came clean. I wasn't in Austin as much as I'd like to be.
[53:55.670 --> 54:01.010]  But I'm not going to just give up this person who helped me for the kindness of their heart to pull this off.
[54:01.150 --> 54:01.790]  What about a clue?
[54:01.790 --> 54:02.750]  Without making sure they're okay with it.
[54:02.750 --> 54:05.890]  I feel like I've accidentally given that away already.
[54:06.030 --> 54:09.310]  So, we're gonna move on.
[54:10.230 --> 54:13.230]  We'll settle this with them and then we'll talk about it next time.
[54:13.830 --> 54:17.790]  If it is Jack, that's...
[54:17.790 --> 54:21.190]  Because then he would have gone to that instead of all of the...
[54:21.590 --> 54:23.310]  Do you guys have your Christmas trees up yet?
[54:23.690 --> 54:25.390]  I still need to put my Christmas tree up.
[54:25.590 --> 54:27.010]  I mean, I will say...
[54:27.010 --> 54:27.830]  You got legs on your counter.
[54:28.170 --> 54:29.170]  Yeah, you have five on your counter.
[54:29.270 --> 54:32.210]  I will say, if it was Jack, it's nice to see him being useful.
[54:32.730 --> 54:33.890]  If it's Jack, it's great.
[54:34.430 --> 54:36.370]  Yeah, I just said it's nice to see him being useful.
[54:36.930 --> 54:38.690]  That's an unnecessary dick.
[54:39.930 --> 54:40.610]  Actually, that's a...
[54:40.610 --> 54:42.850]  No, it's not an unnecessary dick.
[54:42.950 --> 54:43.810]  No, I don't think it's unnecessary.
[54:44.250 --> 54:45.930]  I think it's fucking on point.
[54:47.030 --> 54:49.090]  I don't know what to say in this situation.
[54:49.370 --> 54:54.090]  I'm gonna be quiet until we switch subjects.
[54:54.310 --> 54:56.530]  So, it's someone on Slack.
[54:56.570 --> 54:57.690]  It's someone we work with.
[54:57.690 --> 55:02.090]  And they went so out of their way to help you do this insane thing.
[55:02.290 --> 55:03.190]  Here's what I'm gonna do.
[55:03.690 --> 55:06.250]  I'm gonna message everyone on Slack.
[55:06.650 --> 55:07.490]  I know it was you.
[55:07.850 --> 55:08.250]  Yep.
[55:08.850 --> 55:09.330]  There you go.
[55:09.610 --> 55:10.890]  And one person will reply.
[55:11.910 --> 55:14.110]  How do you message every single person?
[55:14.110 --> 55:17.310]  You don't. You can only message eight at a time.
[55:17.550 --> 55:18.390]  And that's in groups.
[55:18.610 --> 55:19.830]  I don't know how to message everyone.
[55:20.250 --> 55:20.750]  You can just go...
[55:21.410 --> 55:23.750]  Honestly, you can go in the general Slack.
[55:23.930 --> 55:25.250]  And you can just post it there.
[55:25.250 --> 55:26.630]  I can't even type in that one.
[55:26.690 --> 55:27.350]  Let me post.
[55:30.730 --> 55:33.990]  I'm just imagining Gavin going to the biggest Slack group.
[55:34.670 --> 55:36.650]  And saying, I know it was you.
[55:36.890 --> 55:37.750]  But here's the thing.
[55:38.330 --> 55:45.190]  Andrew is telling his little helper not to reply.
[55:45.350 --> 55:48.390]  See, you can't trust this.
[55:49.250 --> 55:51.730]  I also don't know why he's not just talking about it.
[55:51.810 --> 55:53.090]  That's the weirdest part to me.
[55:53.150 --> 55:54.610]  What is there to hide at this point?
[55:55.470 --> 55:56.510]  What if it was Nick?
[55:56.970 --> 56:00.090]  I don't think Nick would drive downtown to do that.
[56:00.810 --> 56:01.410]  Nick has a kid.
[56:01.850 --> 56:03.250]  Nick has a kid. He's got responsibilities.
[56:03.650 --> 56:04.310]  He's got responsibilities.
[56:04.850 --> 56:05.450]  He couldn't do it.
[56:05.510 --> 56:06.390]  I'll talk to the person.
[56:06.590 --> 56:08.690]  And maybe I'll reveal this.
[56:09.470 --> 56:10.830]  I'm not going to throw someone under the bus.
[56:11.530 --> 56:13.530]  I don't want to throw someone under the bus that doesn't...
[56:13.530 --> 56:14.230]  We didn't talk about that.
[56:14.270 --> 56:16.290]  I thought everyone would just think I was in Austin.
[56:16.370 --> 56:17.030]  That was my plan.
[56:18.430 --> 56:19.030]  Hang on.
[56:21.590 --> 56:22.470]  You thought...
[56:22.470 --> 56:25.910]  You thought that everyone thought you were in Austin for real?
[56:26.430 --> 56:27.310]  That was the plan, yeah.
[56:27.350 --> 56:29.950]  It was just everyone would think I was in Austin and I'd go with that.
[56:30.010 --> 56:33.130]  I never considered the possibility of having to say I wasn't in Austin.
[56:33.690 --> 56:35.130]  I didn't talk about that with them.
[56:36.590 --> 56:39.330]  In what world do you think you were tricking us?
[56:39.570 --> 56:39.990]  Right?
[56:40.590 --> 56:43.370]  That was plan A and there was no plan B.
[56:43.650 --> 56:44.990]  I didn't consider...
[56:46.350 --> 56:48.790]  I didn't consider any other scenarios.
[56:49.330 --> 56:52.630]  Plan A is that we would believe you were here?
[56:53.410 --> 56:54.510]  Yeah, because I had all the photos.
[56:55.110 --> 56:57.990]  Did anyone for a single second...
[56:58.550 --> 56:58.890]  No!
[56:59.250 --> 57:02.270]  ...even entertain the idea that you could set foot here?
[57:02.690 --> 57:02.990]  No!
[57:03.330 --> 57:03.590]  No.
[57:04.250 --> 57:06.470]  That was a miscalculation on my part.
[57:06.990 --> 57:08.870]  Listen, some plans go great.
[57:08.950 --> 57:10.330]  The cucumber went really well.
[57:10.330 --> 57:15.450]  That one that we're talking about right now didn't exactly go as I thought it would go.
[57:15.890 --> 57:28.090]  I will say, Andrew, this would be the absolute perfect time to throw an image of you actually being in Austin in the subreddit or the Slack or the Discord or whatever the fuck it would be.
[57:28.510 --> 57:31.090]  And then go, just kidding, it was me. I tricked you again.
[57:31.530 --> 57:32.390]  That would be awesome.
[57:32.750 --> 57:36.230]  So if you can do that right now, you will 100,000% redeem yourself.
[57:36.230 --> 57:40.210]  You also have pictures of you in Austin, I assume, from the past.
[57:40.630 --> 57:43.250]  No, I don't have a single photo of me in Austin.
[57:46.350 --> 57:48.870]  What about the one of you and Gavin at the fucking pinballs?
[57:49.490 --> 57:52.530]  Oh, yeah, I guess that does exist, but that's already been used.
[57:52.630 --> 57:55.470]  That probably wouldn't work if I was in the photo.
[57:56.030 --> 57:58.250]  Although, to be fair, I did forget that I was next to him once before.
[57:58.610 --> 58:01.310]  That's true. That's how sneaky I am.
[58:05.760 --> 58:06.580]  Oh, man.
[58:07.680 --> 58:09.520]  We'll put a nice bow on this in the future.
[58:11.760 --> 58:16.740]  You know how I have that annoying double tap TV thing where I have to turn my TV off twice?
[58:17.280 --> 58:17.460]  Yeah.
[58:17.900 --> 58:22.160]  I have a new annoying thing that's going on in my life that makes me...
[58:22.160 --> 58:26.560]  It's been going for like three weeks now, and I want to fucking murder somebody for it.
[58:27.180 --> 58:28.280]  I'm so angry.
[58:28.800 --> 58:36.320]  You know, I have Hulu. That's how I watch the Real Housewives franchises that I watch.
[58:36.320 --> 58:40.100]  Beverly Hills, Potomac, and Salt Lake City are the three that I'm into.
[58:40.640 --> 58:43.420]  Right now, Beverly Hills is on hiatus, obviously.
[58:44.200 --> 58:45.140]  Everybody knows that.
[58:45.560 --> 58:50.400]  But Salt Lake City and Potomac are going strong, and so every Wednesday, I watch Salt Lake City.
[58:50.500 --> 58:52.940]  Every Sunday, I watch Potomac with Emily.
[58:53.360 --> 58:57.120]  There is this thing happening now on Hulu where...
[58:57.120 --> 59:00.600]  And we have the Hulu Plus or whatever, so you get live TV through it.
[59:00.620 --> 59:02.400]  So we get all of our TV through it.
[59:03.660 --> 59:06.940]  Which is essentially like cable. I don't know why we just don't have cable still.
[59:09.520 --> 59:19.940]  So I have this thing happening where when it starts to record a new episode of Potomac or Salt Lake City,
[59:21.200 --> 59:23.440]  it records it and I go to play it.
[59:23.600 --> 59:31.260]  If it's still recording or if it's just recorded, at any point in time, the day the episode comes out, it's a black screen.
[59:33.400 --> 59:36.500]  Then the next day, it works.
[59:37.320 --> 59:37.800]  What?
[59:38.700 --> 59:43.680]  And it's only Potomac and it's only Salt Lake City.
[59:43.840 --> 59:47.440]  It's no other shows that I watch. It's no other shows that I record.
[59:47.780 --> 59:51.840]  It's not even other Bravo shows, because those both are on the Bravo channel.
[59:51.940 --> 59:55.220]  Because I watch Mediterranean, Below Deck, and a bunch of other stuff.
[59:55.520 --> 59:59.040]  But it is only those two Real Housewives shows.
[59:59.040 --> 01:00:07.460]  So like last night, I laid in bed with Emily for 45 minutes trying to trick Hulu into letting me see the show that I recorded.
[01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:13.880]  And I just couldn't. And it'd be fine because I have Peacock 2, but they don't show it on Peacock until the next day,
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.960]  which is when it works on the fucking Hulu anyway.
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:21.240]  And so I feel like the goddamn Hulu people are trying to stage an intervention with me
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:25.520]  where they don't want me watching fucking Potomac and Salt Lake City until the next day.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:29.040]  And you might say to yourself, wait a day, that's not a big deal.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:34.420]  Here's why it's a big deal. A, I pay for it. B, I want to watch it when it comes out.
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:39.880]  And C, I listen to Celebrity Gossip and Real Housewives podcasts.
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:44.260]  And they do recaps the next day, and I gotta get up in the morning on Thursday morning,
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:51.200]  and my normal routine is to listen to Danny Pellegrino talk about all the funny shit that happened on Housewives the night before.
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:55.580]  And I can't fucking do that until tomorrow now. I couldn't listen to Danny Pellegrino today
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:59.380]  because it would have spoiled the whole goddamn show. I couldn't listen to Heather McDonald today.
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:04.220]  I couldn't listen to any of it because they'll talk about the goddamn episode last night that I could only hear.
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:05.060]  I couldn't watch.
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.620]  How about this? Watch it live?
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.440]  I can't watch it live! It's black!
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.000]  Oh, it's like...
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.560]  Oh, it happens in the live feed.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:14.880]  Yes!
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.380]  I thought it was... oh, that's funny.
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:18.600]  I thought it was just on the recording.
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:24.880]  Now, I tried the real Housewives of Salt Lake, and it just... I didn't like it all that much.
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:27.800]  Would Potomac... would that work for me, you think? Are they different enough?
[01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:30.340]  Incredibly different.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.300]  Okay, I'll give that a shot for you.
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:37.540]  If you're gonna try... alright, here's the deal. If you're gonna watch Potomac, watch this season.
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.100]  I will. Okay. I'll hop into this season.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.900]  Hop into this season, and if you're gonna do it, it's not far in.
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:48.700]  Like, I'll be honest with you, dude. These shows are... they take a little bit.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.820]  It takes a little bit of time, a little bit of investment on your part to understand the dynamics of the people involved,
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:02:00.060]  and how they all work together. If you stick with Potomac... and I won't recommend Salt Lake City this year.
[01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:04.600]  I'm actually not a huge fan of this season of Salt Lake City. I think... well, I don't wanna...
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:04.700]  Sure.
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:07.760]  People get in trouble for talking shit about certain housewives. I'm not gonna do it.
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:12.580]  But I'm not a huge fan of some of the people on that show this year, who I used to be a fan of.
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:19.880]  But Potomac has a fight between Mia and Wendy in, I wanna say, like, episode 4 or 5,
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:25.880]  that is the most entertaining and wild and craziest thing, and it's set up... it's set up these...
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:29.020]  this fuckin' battle that's going on episode after episode.
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.880]  So it... so do it, but give yourself 4 or 5 episodes. Get to the fight.
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:33.820]  Get to the fight.
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:37.000]  I was about to say, I'll give it a 5-episode run. I'll get to the fight. I'll give it a fair shot.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:37.360]  And then see.
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:41.100]  Not to go too deep on reality TV. Last two episodes of Survivor. So good.
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:42.100]  Goddamn.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:45.980]  Goddamn it. I was... my pick to win got voted out last night.
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:48.100]  Gavin, you haven't been keeping up with the season.
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:49.680]  No, I haven't watched it.
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.620]  I don't feel like this is that big of a spoiler at all for, like, what matters.
[01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:57.460]  They did a thing where all the people that were left, they gave them a thing that was like,
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.840]  hey, there's an advantage in the woods, go find it.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.060]  And everybody scrambled for it.
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:06.340]  And what they did was they attached it, because typically it's, like, low down and it's, like,
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:08.100]  in the dirt that you have to dig through.
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:12.920]  They just attached it to the middle of a tree, like, lined up with everyone's sight line.
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:16.840]  And it was the thing where everybody was just walking past it, being like,
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:18.680]  I have no fucking idea where this thing is.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:24.420]  Like, people were brushing their noses against the advantage, talking about how they couldn't see it.
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.240]  It's fantastic.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:30.180]  There were people having conversations in front of it when it was, like, at their eye level.
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:30.880]  Yes.
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.280]  Here's a tip, by the way, if you're ever going to go on Survivor.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:39.180]  If you notice a cameraman filming you from a certain angle, and he or she won't move,
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:42.160]  there's a fucking... there's something there.
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:45.020]  Yeah, and he keeps doing, like, a rack focus to the trees.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:48.680]  Yeah, any time you see a rack focus, there's an idol.
[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:51.980]  It's hilariously infuriating, because it's not a brief thing.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.440]  It is, like, a two-minute sequence of people resting their head on the advantage,
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:02.180]  laying against the tree with no concept it's there, and then just continuing on looking for it.
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:03.880]  It's great. So good.
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:08.700]  And it's not, like, super camouflaged or anything. It's pretty fucking noticeable.
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.880]  No, it's pretty blatant. It's fantastic.
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:14.580]  It's one of the best scenes I think the show has had in a long time.
[01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.140]  Just so goddamn funny.
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:19.720]  It reminds me of... there was a show called Crystal Maze in the UK.
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:23.200]  It was, like, a... you get a certain amount of time in a room, and if you don't get out in time,
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.120]  you get locked in, and you have to get crystals, and then take them to the end.
[01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:31.000]  But there was one where it was, like, a mirrored maze, and the crystal was at the end,
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.080]  and there's this guy, like, crawling through this mirrored tunnel,
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:37.520]  and he gets all the way to the end with the crystal right in front of him on the floor,
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:42.540]  but he reaches for it in the reflection of the mirror and just bangs his hand on the mirror
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.480]  and doesn't know what to do. He's just like, oh.
[01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:49.100]  And then he was running out of time, so he crawls all the way back out without getting it.
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:53.860]  It was literally, like, under his hand, but he tried to grab the reflection version instead of the real one.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.500]  And it's probably the dumbest I've ever seen someone be filmed on camera.
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:05.440]  We should probably wrap up. I gotta get going.
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.720]  Dude, thank you so much for listening to this episode of F*** Face.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:15.980]  I hope you, being the audience, enjoyed it, because a lot of pre-pro went into this one.
[01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:17.300]  Way more than usual.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.500]  Way more than I realized.
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:25.840]  And it was, can I just say, it was an absolute treat to pull off, and I'm so glad it worked.
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:29.800]  Thank you for being such a good sport, Gavin, and not holding it against me.
[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:30.520]  Good heist.
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:32.220]  This was not my fight.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:38.480]  I'm just working in my role as a free agent.
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:41.420]  Well, I'm glad. This has opened some doors for me. I'm excited.
[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:44.900]  Absolutely. Maybe you can tape Monopoly money to those doors.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.120]  Not on my watch.
[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:53.740]  Alright, like and review and all that nonsense, and you know what?
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.400]  Tell a friend.
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.780]  Tell a friend about F*** Face.
[01:05:58.180 --> 01:05:59.860]  Tell them about how much fun we have.
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.080]  Tell them about all the shenanigans we get up to.
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:05.120]  Tell them about cucumbers and Wilford Brimley.
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:08.220]  And whale sharks.
[01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:11.560]  And popelitzes.
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:14.680]  Tell them about the oxygen level.
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:17.020]  Or CO2 level.
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:22.740]  If you manage to turn your friend on to F*** Face based on those instructions, please let us know.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.320]  There's no way that makes any sense to anyone.
[01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:29.660]  And we'll see you next week for episode 135.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.260]  Bye for now.
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:31.800]  Bye.
[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:32.640]  Bye.
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.520]  I'm gonna throw away some cucumbers.
[01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:39.640]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.440]  Gavin has a fancy clock.
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:42.760]  Get out of bed quickly.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.260]  Let's talk about really old videos.
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:46.820]  It's time for a poll.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.520]  We've got a piss update.
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:51.000]  Geoff knows way too much about duck penis.
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:54.040]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:57.040]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
