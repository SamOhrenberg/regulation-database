[00:15.480 --> 00:15.960]  I
[00:15.960 --> 00:19.500]  Wish Craig had been recording earlier because this podcast started about two minutes ago. No, I
[00:21.720 --> 00:26.980]  Want to be on your side Gavin, it's not your fault doesn't sound like you're on his side at all
[00:26.980 --> 00:32.200]  It does not sound like you're on Gavin's side at I'm what I couldn't be more on Gavin's side
[00:32.200 --> 00:39.400]  You're great arguing against people and then at the end revealing that you're on the same side. You're completely you've done nothing wrong here
[00:39.400 --> 00:39.980]  It's just
[00:41.640 --> 00:44.580]  You just gotta laugh at the situation. Why are we laughing at?
[00:44.740 --> 00:49.120]  I'm laughing at the fact that you answered a question with zero answer, but you've said a lot of words
[00:49.120 --> 00:53.960]  That was that was it. Oh, that is not a man on your side
[00:53.960 --> 00:59.780]  That is not a response of a man on somebody. Absolutely not. I'm completely on Gavin's side
[00:59.780 --> 01:02.080]  There's no zero other response
[01:02.080 --> 01:06.860]  He could give it just as a comedic one in the context of what was being looked after
[01:06.860 --> 01:11.520]  Or what was being searched for by Eric? I guess there's give content where we're talking about the fireplace video
[01:11.520 --> 01:15.160]  Which is out by now if we did it. I would assume. Well, I can't say that
[01:15.160 --> 01:18.320]  No, we can't say that after the pizza thing, but I don't understand
[01:18.320 --> 01:23.080]  I thought the whole thing about the fireplace video is that we were filming it and then it has to be out like this year
[01:23.080 --> 01:26.560]  Yeah, well, that's what I said is that it would be funny because like the whole point of it
[01:26.560 --> 01:30.500]  We should have done this going in to the start of December, but now we're just doing it
[01:30.500 --> 01:32.900]  I don't think it matters on that much if it's late. It's already late
[01:32.900 --> 01:38.020]  Yeah, what would be the turnaround because we talked about this briefly about like how fast we could get it up
[01:38.020 --> 01:44.540]  Yeah, I would say considering it's the 20th and it should be up before Christmas. We didn't do it. No. Well, wait
[01:44.540 --> 01:48.660]  We're not doing it now. Well, when's it supposed to be out by?
[01:49.020 --> 01:53.220]  Isn't it a Christmas thing? Yeah, well it should be but I think we're past the window of Christmas
[01:53.220 --> 01:59.420]  So I just assumed it would come out in January. Get a nice January fire. Okay, then we can put it out in January
[01:59.420 --> 02:04.680]  So it's good and early for 2024. Exactly. I can't wait for two YouTube videos to come out
[02:04.680 --> 02:09.780]  One is called 8k fireplace. The other is called fireplace day. I'm just excited to see the thumbnail
[02:09.780 --> 02:16.800]  The idea that Geoff just gave was that Andrew does eight hours of commentary. So that would be two videos
[02:18.140 --> 02:23.520]  Independently had that thought because I think it's funny to do like a reaction video to a fireplace thing
[02:23.520 --> 02:27.780]  But it's eight hours long. Yeah, that's a lot. I don't know
[02:27.780 --> 02:32.800]  Maybe I'll try it. I have my own idea for the fireplace that I'm excited to present to you guys when I get to it
[02:32.800 --> 02:38.540]  Okay, there you go face 136, my name is Geoff Ramsey with me as always Andrew Panton and
[02:39.300 --> 02:43.640]  Face YouTube strategist Gavin free. I really like this time
[02:46.780 --> 02:52.160]  What's up, I don't know if anyone ever like raises an issue then suddenly it's like you do it
[02:52.160 --> 02:55.560]  I just want you to know that I'm on your side. That's really all that's important
[02:57.580 --> 03:03.400]  Watch your fucking back cuz Andrew's on your side, dude. He's coming for you. No, I'm with you arm around shoulder
[03:03.400 --> 03:05.680]  I'm on his team team Gavin and this
[03:07.180 --> 03:08.760]  Speaking of the fireplace thing
[03:08.760 --> 03:15.400]  Do you guys know how much would you guess it would cost to book Santa in Austin for 15 minutes?
[03:15.760 --> 03:20.640]  Well, is this like a full beard Santa a real beard Santa as real beard Santa proper Santa?
[03:20.900 --> 03:24.020]  I think it's about 250 bucks for 15 minutes
[03:24.020 --> 03:26.600]  What would you say Gavin hundred hundred bucks?
[03:27.100 --> 03:31.780]  So I was thinking about because I'm not gonna be in the the fireplace filming thing
[03:31.780 --> 03:37.080]  But I thought oh, what would be a fun way to somehow like interact with that content?
[03:37.080 --> 03:39.700]  And I thought what if I just send a Santa to the house?
[03:40.660 --> 03:44.580]  Randomly during the eight hours and so I searched and I got quoted
[03:44.580 --> 03:51.260]  I sent like a thing out to ten different Santa Claus agencies in Texas and I thought maybe I'll do this
[03:51.260 --> 03:52.580]  But then I got the first one back
[03:54.340 --> 04:01.040]  $325 was the first quote. I got back for an hour for 15 15 minutes. It's over a grand an hour. It's
[04:01.880 --> 04:06.940]  Ridiculous, they get to work fucking one day a year. They got to make a year's worth of pay in one day
[04:09.360 --> 04:11.560]  An hourly rate and times it by 12
[04:11.560 --> 04:14.740]  Yeah, like why even reach out they must live in a different state
[04:14.740 --> 04:20.860]  Like I appreciate it that guidelines and regulations around being a Santa like is there a Santa Union and yeah
[04:20.860 --> 04:26.400]  Just like what there is there is like a training program for it. I don't think it's like an official Union
[04:26.400 --> 04:28.840]  I don't I watched a video on this years ago
[04:28.840 --> 04:33.280]  But there is like a guy that is considered the the the like
[04:33.280 --> 04:38.480]  staple Santa that everyone should look up to and he does courses and a program like
[04:38.480 --> 04:45.280]  People show up and they get they graduate essentially Santa school and they go through like it's a two or three day conference of
[04:45.280 --> 04:48.840]  Santas and was this guy a licensed Santa or is it just yeah
[04:49.980 --> 04:54.000]  He's no he's like the face of the Santa the mall Santa Empire
[04:54.000 --> 04:59.420]  Essentially and everybody loves this guy and he's Jewish, but I mean the guy that you were getting a quote for
[04:59.420 --> 05:02.520]  Oh, no, I have no idea those those dudes are specialized
[05:02.520 --> 05:05.880]  I think you do have to go through some sort of certification and training
[05:05.880 --> 05:09.980]  Because what they do and I know this because Emily was looking it up for something else
[05:09.980 --> 05:12.600]  And so I just happened to learn about it through her
[05:12.600 --> 05:18.820]  But they'll come in to your house for like 250 300 bucks for 15 minutes. You put the kids to bed, right?
[05:18.840 --> 05:24.900]  or whatever then you let them like peek down the stairs and then Santa comes in and like drop some fucking presents out in front of
[05:24.900 --> 05:29.460]  The tree and like drinks the milk and the cookie and then leaves and the kids think they saw real Santa Claus
[05:29.460 --> 05:31.680]  I mean that kind of one of the parents do that
[05:31.680 --> 05:36.440]  Yeah, but if you want to pay somebody who looks a hell of a lot more like Santa Claus
[05:36.880 --> 05:37.280]  Yeah
[05:40.240 --> 05:44.980]  Get a respect the craft Gavin kids is off in there, but that was
[05:45.520 --> 05:48.820]  The lowest quote I ended up getting with I think was like a hundred eighty five
[05:48.840 --> 05:53.000]  Yeah, which is closer. That's like on the range of maybe wanting to do it, but
[05:53.740 --> 05:59.260]  After the cucumber bit I said different packages like is there an option for them to come down the chimney?
[05:59.600 --> 06:04.900]  Oh, I'd wish that'd be fantastic. There should be that would be such a funny checklist to have
[06:05.860 --> 06:09.320]  Will come to I would check that every time I don't care what the premium is
[06:09.860 --> 06:15.860]  Have you ever been at a party where somebody has appeared out of the chimney at some point during it? That would be amazing
[06:15.860 --> 06:17.440]  I've had raccoons come down my chimney
[06:18.240 --> 06:20.100]  Yeah, how were they as party guests?
[06:21.920 --> 06:26.120]  Have you really yeah, there was a problem with my my first house like the
[06:27.060 --> 06:27.460]  flue
[06:28.280 --> 06:30.120]  hatch thing was stuck open and
[06:31.320 --> 06:36.780]  Raccoons would come in and die. Oh, is that how you had the dead raccoon in your house? They came in from the fireplace. Yeah
[06:38.020 --> 06:41.760]  Yeah, the the next-door neighbor was telling me that the previous owner was
[06:43.120 --> 06:43.520]  I
[06:44.380 --> 06:47.080]  said raccoons falling into his living room, but
[06:47.080 --> 06:54.460]  He'd have to trap them in cages and then hand them over to his neighbor and his neighbor was telling me in graphic detail
[06:54.460 --> 06:55.180]  how he had this
[06:55.820 --> 07:00.660]  How he had a piece of wood with a big nail through it and he would just club these raccoons to death
[07:00.660 --> 07:06.400]  Oh, that was the first conversation I had with that with that neighbor. Oh
[07:07.060 --> 07:12.400]  Bashing them like Charlie bashes the rats and stuff. Oh, I didn't have many more conversations with him after that
[07:12.400 --> 07:14.220]  he was like, yeah, if you got any raccoons, just
[07:14.900 --> 07:17.860]  Just bag them and bring them over and I'll get my plank
[07:24.200 --> 07:29.160]  That's terrifying how do we get off this animal death kick that we're on at the moment? Oh, we can we pivot already
[07:29.160 --> 07:34.240]  Do you want to we have a lot of things we can just stop talking about it. Yeah, it's really easy
[07:34.240 --> 07:35.540]  It's an easy pivot to do
[07:36.420 --> 07:37.180]  I was
[07:37.660 --> 07:38.360]  so I
[07:39.200 --> 07:44.020]  Stated on the show December 15th. It was my mom's birthday. It's recent and
[07:44.020 --> 07:50.660]  As part of it, I went through some old family videos and I was doing this as prep
[07:51.400 --> 07:54.180]  Beforehand, are you gonna share that photo? I am gonna share
[07:54.180 --> 07:58.520]  I didn't want to bring it up because I didn't know if you would if you wanted to share it with the class
[07:58.520 --> 08:04.960]  No, I'm gonna share it with the class. Okay. I said for context months ago when I was initially going through
[08:04.960 --> 08:08.000]  I found some old family tapes and I was just reviewing what we had
[08:09.060 --> 08:13.480]  I noticed that my head at all stages of life was
[08:13.480 --> 08:19.620]  Absurdly large way too big for my body and I said to Geoff and I know this is on brand
[08:19.620 --> 08:24.320]  I've never done it. I know the whole thing. I was an extremely kickable child
[08:24.320 --> 08:27.560]  I was so kickable just because I feel like I
[08:27.560 --> 08:33.280]  Would fly like the momentum of my head going down a hill like just the impact and the speed it would generate
[08:33.280 --> 08:34.200]  I was
[08:34.820 --> 08:41.480]  Extremely kickable. And so I said to Geoff next time I watch these I'll send you a photo to illustrate my point of
[08:42.100 --> 08:46.540]  Not just how fucking big my head was just how kickable of a child. I
[08:46.540 --> 08:50.180]  Was like you talk about kickable in the head like your entire anywhere
[08:50.180 --> 08:50.480]  No
[08:50.480 --> 08:56.520]  like if you kicked me in the chest because of how big my head is it would be like a boulder rolling down a hill like
[08:56.520 --> 09:00.140]  It was just like he he looked like an upside-down
[09:00.140 --> 09:05.700]  Weeble-wobble like you want to kick him in the head just so that he'd flip over and it'd be the right way
[09:05.700 --> 09:11.440]  So I'm gonna post this right now and the group thing. Look at how fucking big my head is it is
[09:11.440 --> 09:13.780]  absurd I
[09:13.780 --> 09:15.900]  It's massive
[09:17.480 --> 09:24.360]  There's so many things there's so many angles it's I almost look like a I feel genuinely bad laughing at a baby, but it's you
[09:24.360 --> 09:26.420]  It looks like
[09:26.420 --> 09:31.780]  Yes, I have looked at this photo probably 400 times already
[09:33.460 --> 09:39.080]  It's I almost look like a ghoul from Fallout because it's like I don't have enough skin
[09:39.080 --> 09:46.460]  For how big my head is like everything is home. Did your face eventually move towards the front of your head?
[09:47.200 --> 09:53.480]  It did we had a thankfully we approached forward it never rained on Andrews nose
[09:54.640 --> 09:56.160]  Why do you think was unbreakable
[10:01.280 --> 10:06.420]  I mean the immediate exactly like the dude with the helmet under his hat without
[10:08.700 --> 10:13.820]  Unbelievable, I look like Megaman's kid. There's all sorts of angles. You could go with this
[10:13.820 --> 10:19.140]  I said I've said I look like Pac-man with legs. Like I it's just I'm all head. I'm
[10:19.140 --> 10:22.060]  90% head that was very
[10:22.060 --> 10:29.600]  Big head, but what you're leaving out that your head is the normal size from the eyes down
[10:31.840 --> 10:37.980]  You have you had like half a big head he has an adult cranium in a kid's face
[10:37.980 --> 10:43.700]  It's looks it looks like I'm hiding one of those baseball helmet hats under my skin
[10:43.700 --> 10:47.460]  Like that's just in my head. Like I invented that
[10:47.460 --> 10:49.820]  Did you get stung by a wasp earlier in the day?
[10:51.020 --> 10:51.980]  I wish
[10:55.960 --> 10:59.460]  You look like an extra in like the Xavier school of
[11:00.700 --> 11:05.440]  From a young age you would definitely have like CG building blocks
[11:12.220 --> 11:13.920]  School for not so gifted
[11:14.920 --> 11:18.800]  First to that kid I would immediately think telekinesis is an option
[11:19.780 --> 11:26.960]  That kid you oh my god. What did you do to your poor mother c-section? Oh
[11:28.520 --> 11:29.920]  Andrew that is
[11:32.540 --> 11:33.960]  So extreme
[11:38.480 --> 11:40.100]  My hat problem
[12:00.400 --> 12:00.800]  I
[12:02.840 --> 12:08.380]  Sent him a photo of me as a kid and he uh, he had the nerve to say I had a big head
[12:09.760 --> 12:11.540]  Do you like the leader? Oh
[12:12.480 --> 12:16.360]  I'm not a picture of him. Yeah, that's insane. How old are you that?
[12:17.060 --> 12:22.260]  Probably like six or seven months old. I'm surprised you could stand. I
[12:22.260 --> 12:24.280]  Think I'm no, it's like in a chair thing
[12:26.340 --> 12:31.840]  I'm in like a stand chair, right and you're and you're using your psychic abilities to make it float around the room. Yeah
[12:31.840 --> 12:37.580]  Yeah, exactly. Mm-hmm. I'm actually holding myself up. You must have had the strongest little neck ever
[12:39.960 --> 12:40.400]  Oh
[12:40.400 --> 12:47.260]  Maybe yeah, it's yeah could be that's a fantastic photo without this origin story pillow mountain can never have existed
[12:47.260 --> 12:50.740]  I needed that's how I built the neck. I get pillow mountain now
[12:50.740 --> 12:57.000]  Yeah, I mean that head requires at least four pillows by itself. Oh easy. Yeah, that's a mass
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.980]  Yeah, I bet you put a head that heavy on pillows. It just goes right the room. Oh, yeah
[13:00.980 --> 13:03.120]  No, you need you need firm support for sure
[13:03.660 --> 13:07.140]  Undeniably, so that was great. I was happy to see it's also like
[13:07.580 --> 13:12.600]  The best angle maybe so happy to come across that. Hey still a cute kid though
[13:12.600 --> 13:15.160]  I wish I had I'll see if if I encounter any more
[13:15.160 --> 13:18.460]  I still have a few more tapes to go through I'll make sure to send them to you
[13:18.980 --> 13:22.400]  I have to scroll up but I can't stop laughing at that. I
[13:22.400 --> 13:27.000]  Would have been terrified of you because I would have thought that baby's trying to set me on fire with his mind
[13:28.420 --> 13:29.420]  But very cute
[13:30.040 --> 13:36.980]  Have we ever measured your head? No, I there's another one where I am wearing a hat like the I got a train conductor cap
[13:36.980 --> 13:42.220]  For Christmas, so I think at some point it may be bounced out and then it it like grew again
[13:42.220 --> 13:46.080]  I don't know. There's a small window where I think it may have been average
[13:46.980 --> 13:54.320]  I'll have to go through a document. Would you say you have an a big head now? Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah massive
[13:54.960 --> 14:02.000]  Massive head. Yeah, like one of those like Easter Island statue big head like that level of huge
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.400]  What just means you have you have that much brain? Yeah, that's definitely what that means
[14:06.400 --> 14:11.680]  Actually, it shouldn't let's hope it doesn't mean that because I'm not at all utilizing it if that's the case
[14:11.680 --> 14:14.180]  That's a terrible usage of brain
[14:14.180 --> 14:19.620]  I think I know why you've grown up thinking you have an unbreakable nose because I don't think anything could hit it
[14:19.620 --> 14:22.960]  Yeah, that's what I was saying. Yeah, I gave it cover. It's protected
[14:23.700 --> 14:25.100]  It's like at the back
[14:25.100 --> 14:32.240]  It developed at that time. I never wanted to happen, but I don't think there'd be anything worse than breaking my nose
[14:32.240 --> 14:38.120]  I'd be so disappointed like beyond the injury itself. Just demoralizing. Yeah, that would that be like
[14:38.760 --> 14:44.880]  Life-shattering for you because it would change it would change a lot of universal truths in your life. I would imagine it would yeah
[14:44.880 --> 14:50.740]  There's a clip of one of the baby tapes where I'm being given a slice of apple and I've never been more on edge
[14:50.740 --> 14:52.640]  I was like you better fucking accept this apple
[14:52.640 --> 14:58.700]  You better enjoy and accept this apple because this is this is part of my being now. I thankfully ate it
[14:58.700 --> 15:00.620]  I was happy about it, but I was worried
[15:00.620 --> 15:05.200]  I was terrified that I would reject the apple because that does not align with who I am. Any idea
[15:05.200 --> 15:10.400]  What kind of apple it was you were being given? I was really trying to tell but I couldn't. Definitely wasn't a Granny Smith
[15:10.400 --> 15:14.720]  I don't think Cosmic Crisp definitely didn't exist at that point. Well, God
[15:15.160 --> 15:20.140]  Speaking of apples, let me send you guys a fucking photo. Yeah, the apple bag. What a perfect transition
[15:20.140 --> 15:25.680]  So does it say on the side? Geoff, you wrote when it was gonna be opened by right? Oh, yeah. We're actually past
[15:25.680 --> 15:30.400]  What was the date written? I'll show it to you guys and you can see it. It's pretty clearly
[15:31.220 --> 15:35.580]  When you see it, please don't be too fucking powerful to send this JPEG
[15:36.360 --> 15:41.260]  Okay, there you go. December 9th, 2022. Okay, so we're way past it
[15:41.260 --> 15:44.280]  And the whole point was that this apple was supposed to be able to last a year
[15:44.280 --> 15:50.140]  Yeah, but unfortunately today's the 20th. So it's 11 days past due. It's 11 days past due
[15:50.760 --> 15:55.640]  On top of the fact that I've seen other apples that have been held for a year that have
[15:56.220 --> 15:59.900]  Existed way better than Geoff says I think putting it in the bag
[15:59.900 --> 16:04.160]  Was the death of Geoff's apple on top of the fact that your fridge doesn't really work
[16:04.160 --> 16:10.360]  Yeah, it's just I think the fridge and the bag together did not make for an appetizing year
[16:11.460 --> 16:15.580]  When when did it start looking? Well, when did the inside come out? Yeah
[16:15.580 --> 16:19.900]  I picked it up like four months ago and it looked like this and I went oh god
[16:19.900 --> 16:25.440]  I wonder if it's cider. I well, I don't know. I hope I don't get I don't drink it may have gone alcoholic
[16:27.080 --> 16:32.920]  I'm scared to open the bag. Should I here? Should I I think you have to open it. Yeah, you should go on cameras
[16:32.920 --> 16:35.180]  Yeah, okay. I've turned. Oh, hell. Yeah
[16:35.960 --> 16:40.720]  Camera on can you see? Yeah, if you give me a second I can record you want me to record this?
[16:41.120 --> 16:44.260]  Yeah, please. Yeah, I can't promise that I'm gonna eat it, but I can't promise no
[16:44.920 --> 16:50.600]  Promise that you're gonna eat it. It's fine. Uh, give us just give me just a second. No, uh, I'm loving the laser show
[16:50.600 --> 16:54.620]  By the way. Oh, thanks. That's the thing that scared the shit out of me the other day when I thought someone was trying to strangle me
[16:56.100 --> 17:01.460]  That was the shadow. It was in it. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. What a jolly shadow. Yeah, it's pretty nice
[17:01.460 --> 17:06.740]  Well, it's gets you know, it's all over tiny town. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I love your tiny town
[17:06.740 --> 17:11.400]  I know it's fucking rocking this year, dude. Okay. All right recording. All right, here we go. Here's the bag
[17:12.140 --> 17:13.400]  you can see the
[17:14.160 --> 17:14.520]  fucking
[17:19.740 --> 17:23.620]  That's like that's like it looks like a dog got popped. Oh
[17:24.520 --> 17:29.980]  No, we're pivoting away, how does stuff get alcoholic do you need to add stuff or does it just ferment on its own?
[17:29.980 --> 17:33.800]  It just ferments on its own. Maybe yeah, I might honestly have booze in it
[17:33.800 --> 17:36.820]  This hasn't been opened in over a year. So now let me smell
[17:45.120 --> 17:52.200]  No, Geoff if somebody's piss smelled like that, would you comment on it in a public place?
[17:52.280 --> 17:54.900]  Yeah, if I smelled that I would comment on oh
[17:55.920 --> 17:56.880]  it's so
[17:58.160 --> 18:00.080]  You able to extract the Apple
[18:05.020 --> 18:06.540]  Mushed in half just
[18:07.740 --> 18:13.900]  Now Evans gonna throw up Gavin's gonna throw up is the smell. That's the Apple
[18:16.020 --> 18:18.780]  Does no it smells like
[18:21.600 --> 18:24.700]  Do you actually join the club you're not gonna you're not the only one
[18:30.870 --> 18:31.310]  Oh
[18:31.310 --> 18:40.230]  No, Geoff's squeezing the Apple and it's just mushy and liquid do not eat it do not
[18:41.110 --> 18:42.530]  Just stay away from it
[18:42.530 --> 18:45.570]  Do apples turn into poison at some point? Can somebody know?
[18:45.650 --> 18:49.730]  I'm so no, I think we're worried about the permitting ever and I don't think that's a thing for fairy tales
[18:49.730 --> 18:50.890]  No, it's fine. Go for it
[18:50.890 --> 18:52.090]  Cuz it that
[18:53.490 --> 18:59.150]  Don't know just put it just a little just like a little so small. No
[19:01.470 --> 19:01.910]  No
[19:03.290 --> 19:04.190]  Tastes like an apple
[19:06.430 --> 19:11.850]  Wait, hang on he stopped now. He's gonna throw up. Yes stop. No Geoff
[19:18.380 --> 19:25.720]  He's leaving to throw up which is not understandable Gavin is already puking. Uh-huh. Nick. How you doing over there? I
[19:25.720 --> 19:27.260]  I'm gonna be honest. I had to look away
[19:28.700 --> 19:31.900]  Nick Oh Nick might be Nick Nick just passed out
[19:35.360 --> 19:36.660]  Uh, I mean
[19:36.660 --> 19:43.560]  The fact yeah, that's great. People will be able to watch it on the YouTube version. They want to see it live as it's happening
[19:44.180 --> 19:46.960]  He's coming back. You know Geoff is a real trooper the fact that he's
[19:51.040 --> 19:58.480]  What the fuck is going on really had to check on you I threw up I threw up on my kitchen sink
[20:02.180 --> 20:03.560]  Oh my god, that was gross
[20:03.920 --> 20:10.420]  I'm gonna turn off my camera now. Oh, yeah. All right. Oh my god recording. Uh, you okay, Geoff. I was hideous
[20:10.960 --> 20:12.040]  Gavin where you at?
[20:13.760 --> 20:15.480]  I missed all that. I threw up
[20:17.540 --> 20:22.320]  Well, you can watch my mouth you can watch the YouTube version when it comes up you can do it again
[20:23.580 --> 20:26.080]  You're not the only one that threw up buddy. Oh
[20:26.080 --> 20:31.480]  No, did you eat some I was throwing up. Yeah. Yeah, he did. Oh, he ate like a bunch of it
[20:31.480 --> 20:33.000]  Yeah, I took like three bites
[20:33.000 --> 20:36.740]  I need to I just need to brush my teeth
[20:38.680 --> 20:43.280]  We'll stop down for you know, just a second, it's fine. Oh, I'm just gonna say that I think
[20:44.460 --> 20:50.940]  Why would you post the puke? What the fuck? Oh, I mean, I mean, why did you do that?
[20:51.360 --> 20:53.000]  That's what came out of my mouth. Yeah
[20:54.300 --> 20:59.800]  Nobody's gonna question that. What are you doing? It's a tomato that is
[21:03.780 --> 21:06.400]  That's infinitely we can't post that what
[21:07.980 --> 21:10.780]  They'll never know what it is. Oh
[21:10.780 --> 21:17.280]  It's terrible. I just this is the first time that I think I'm not the one puking on the show our old
[21:17.280 --> 21:21.960]  Apples poison. Oh my god. I
[21:21.960 --> 21:25.820]  Mean there's not there's as Eric said there's not been an iconic poison
[21:27.200 --> 21:31.240]  You'll be good. You didn't I mean, I assume you you chewed it but didn't eat it
[21:31.240 --> 21:33.660]  I hope you didn't consume any of it. I
[21:34.440 --> 21:39.260]  Couldn't swallow it. It was too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you just spit it out spit out anything, but I got juice in me
[21:39.260 --> 21:45.600]  Uh, I really appreciated that Millie was so concerned about you. She had to come check. Yeah, I'm sure you were okay
[21:45.600 --> 21:47.500]  She's a good kid. She loves her dad
[21:50.160 --> 21:54.460]  You know, so I'm gonna make sure I'm not dying over there I can't believe you tried some of it
[21:54.460 --> 21:58.540]  Well, that's my job, right? I'm genuinely I'm impressed with you. I'll be honest
[21:59.260 --> 22:04.920]  Fucking leave that that's insane. All right. Does anybody else have their year-old Apple? We were all supposed to do it
[22:04.920 --> 22:11.420]  Yeah, no, we've we've been pretty open covered the fact none of us else we have one Gavin never got one
[22:11.420 --> 22:13.840]  I ate mine two months into it
[22:14.340 --> 22:19.720]  Not even probably like seven weeks into when I get my new fridge next year
[22:19.720 --> 22:24.700]  Assuming I get it and I don't have to fucking burn a fridge store down
[22:24.700 --> 22:27.700]  Uh-huh. I'm gonna put a new Apple in on day one
[22:27.700 --> 22:31.660]  Yeah, yeah do the test again and do the test again. Are you gonna put it in a bag?
[22:31.880 --> 22:35.180]  I would recommend not putting in a bag. I don't think so. I'm just gonna leave it on its own
[22:35.180 --> 22:39.560]  Yeah, I think it'll work a lot better from what I've seen I put on a plate or something
[22:39.560 --> 22:44.080]  So it'll it can pool into it. Where is the Apple bag?
[22:44.720 --> 22:48.520]  Oh, I the one I just had yeah, it's in my kitchen sink. Okay
[22:48.520 --> 22:49.360]  I'm just you know
[22:49.360 --> 22:54.580]  I imagine you know at the fireplace video sounds like that's gonna happen if you want to share what that smells like to the other
[22:54.580 --> 22:59.200]  People on this podcast. No might be a good thing. Oh, you think I should save it? Yeah
[22:59.200 --> 23:00.000]  I'm just throwing it out there
[23:00.000 --> 23:04.240]  Just like a thing that you could save is if you want the other people here to smell it and really get a sense of
[23:04.240 --> 23:08.400]  The scent I'll put it. I'll put it back in the fridge and hang on to it for the next time
[23:08.400 --> 23:14.040]  We're all together. I'm back. It's a great idea. I was not expecting you to eat that. No, I wasn't I wasn't either
[23:14.040 --> 23:18.720]  I also was not I feel like I gag pretty often like it doesn't take you to make me gag
[23:19.800 --> 23:24.560]  My mouth just filled on the first gag. I was very surprised. That's so gross
[23:24.580 --> 23:31.160]  Oh, yeah, I just had lunch. Lunch was high. That's true. You didn't leave. What did you have lunch?
[23:31.520 --> 23:36.180]  What did you have? I had some pasta with like tomatoes and corn and oh, that sounds delightful
[23:37.560 --> 23:40.180]  Yeah, I did not expect
[23:40.740 --> 23:42.420]  Well, I didn't think I'd actually eat it
[23:42.420 --> 23:49.040]  But then in the moment I did and then I did not expect how violently I would react like I threw up in my mouth
[23:49.040 --> 23:52.900]  Halfway in the kitchen sink and then I just dumped it out of my mouth into the kitchen sink
[23:52.900 --> 23:54.980]  Yeah, it was like oh
[23:55.440 --> 23:59.280]  No part of it was good. Yeah. Well, anyway, uh
[23:59.280 --> 24:04.440]  There you go. Cosmic Crisp keeps keeps fresh for at least a year and 11 days
[24:05.300 --> 24:05.820]  now
[24:06.540 --> 24:12.780]  Let's say if that was juiced in a glass and you didn't have context you think you would still would it be a problem?
[24:16.560 --> 24:19.980]  Yeah, you wouldn't you yeah, no you
[24:19.980 --> 24:25.800]  Would spit it out immediately or throw it up immediately and go what fuck what happened to this apple juice?
[24:25.880 --> 24:27.480]  Are you trying to kill me? Oh

[25:33.220 --> 25:40.700]  I'm back with another ad and this one is for Express VPN. This is just a little aside. I
[25:40.700 --> 25:45.880]  Love the Express VPN ad copy. It's my favorite just because it goes some wild places
[25:45.880 --> 25:49.920]  So when I said the title of this one being stranger danger, oh boy
[25:49.920 --> 25:57.380]  Strap in going online without Express VPN is like leaving your kids with the nearest stranger while using the restroom
[25:57.380 --> 26:03.820]  Most of the time it's probably fine, but you never truly know who you're trusting. Why would you ever risk it?
[26:03.900 --> 26:08.620]  Why would you risk that? I'm not a parent. That seems like an insane risk to take
[26:08.620 --> 26:13.120]  I mean, I did travel once from San Antonio to Austin with somebody
[26:13.120 --> 26:17.600]  I didn't really know with no cell service, but just I don't know as a parent. Anyway, this is that I'm sorry
[26:17.600 --> 26:21.400]  I should just get to the point. That's why you need to be using Express VPN

[28:47.460 --> 28:49.960]  I added to my life hacks list, by the way
[28:49.960 --> 28:55.220]  Oh, you did you tease this in a text when I think this one might actually be a life hack
[28:55.220 --> 28:59.020]  Okay, I'm excited for this because I'd love to have a proper hack on this show
[28:59.020 --> 29:03.900]  Yeah, whenever you buy something take the manual right and put it in a drawer
[29:03.900 --> 29:07.980]  Next to the toilet. How are you gonna read with sunglasses on?
[29:07.980 --> 29:08.220]  Oh
[29:15.320 --> 29:17.740]  Sunglasses with a light on the side
[29:18.440 --> 29:21.780]  Okay shines directly at me. So I'm just trying to think of things
[29:21.780 --> 29:24.900]  There are very few things I require a manual for that
[29:24.900 --> 29:26.840]  I also don't need the thing at the same time
[29:26.840 --> 29:31.380]  You must have things where it's like, you know how to work it on a basic waffle makers and stuff
[29:31.380 --> 29:35.140]  Yeah, but like what you if you know the basics of it, but you want to learn advanced stuff
[29:35.140 --> 29:38.980]  I have that with cameras sometimes where it's like a billion different options. That's fair
[29:38.980 --> 29:41.300]  I just I don't think I engage in anything in that way
[29:41.300 --> 29:45.800]  So like when I think of a manual that I use it would be like if I bought a Lego set
[29:45.800 --> 29:48.840]  But that's like reading it in the bathroom is not gonna help me
[29:50.120 --> 29:52.100]  I'm not gonna remember page six
[29:52.100 --> 29:58.320]  I get where you're going with that Gav, but I feel like anytime I crack one of those manuals open and I go through it
[29:58.320 --> 29:58.940]  I
[29:58.940 --> 30:05.060]  Learn that the manual has a bunch of shit in it that doesn't that I either I know already or doesn't apply to me
[30:05.060 --> 30:08.420]  In any way whatsoever and anything useful is hidden and I can't find it
[30:08.420 --> 30:11.180]  Yeah, I find that to be more frustrating than you helpful
[30:11.180 --> 30:15.480]  There's nothing like getting a game as a kid and reading the manual on the way home
[30:15.480 --> 30:19.920]  I think that is I think the top manual experience when I think of my time using them
[30:19.920 --> 30:24.060]  I used to read every single page of every game manual. Oh, absolutely
[30:24.060 --> 30:29.000]  Yeah, because sometimes there'd be story stuff in it. Like it wouldn't just be instructional. They were great
[30:29.000 --> 30:32.560]  I would even buy like pre-owned game strategy guides for games
[30:32.560 --> 30:38.160]  I didn't have just so I could like read the game because I couldn't afford the actual game. That's interesting
[30:38.160 --> 30:41.020]  What is there any that you read the guide for that?
[30:41.120 --> 30:46.780]  You never ended up playing ever like I imagine at some point you would eventually play these games even if there wasn't a media
[30:48.220 --> 30:48.660]  Yeah
[30:49.720 --> 30:54.080]  Hitman contracts you haven't played hitman contracts for summary. There are some I
[30:54.840 --> 30:57.860]  Think this has happened to me a few times where I'm a huge fan of something
[30:57.860 --> 31:01.280]  But the third one I hate like a
[31:01.280 --> 31:05.980]  Rush hour love rush hour wanted to the third one is shite. Yeah
[31:07.040 --> 31:11.440]  It's made by all the same people just blows and I felt the same way about hitman
[31:12.160 --> 31:14.880]  Contracts, which was the third one. I just couldn't get into it
[31:14.880 --> 31:21.240]  I just played the first couple levels for this shit for some reason couldn't even dial in why I didn't like about it
[31:21.240 --> 31:26.680]  So I just I just read the whole game. That's great because it's before you could just watch a let's play
[31:29.040 --> 31:34.720]  Yeah, did you guys see they're making a new rush hour Oh God, I'd I'd like saw there's a photo or something
[31:34.720 --> 31:38.000]  Did they confirm that that was the thing that was gonna happen? I thought so
[31:38.000 --> 31:40.040]  I wasn't sure if everybody was locked in
[31:40.040 --> 31:46.000]  Last I heard like they weren't sure that Chris Tucker was gonna be in it and you can't have rush hour for without Chris Tucker
[31:46.000 --> 31:50.660]  You can't have rush hour with it without either of them. Yeah, no, they're they're vital to the thing
[31:50.660 --> 31:53.520]  Yeah, it looks like Jackie Chan converged. It's in the
[31:54.280 --> 31:59.320]  Mentioned it's in the early stages. Can he still fight though? Could he still do stunts?
[31:59.540 --> 32:01.300]  I don't know. Maybe that'll be a part of the show
[32:01.300 --> 32:01.880]  I bet yeah
[32:01.880 --> 32:08.800]  I was gonna say I think eventually it might Jackie Chan might have a similar arc to jackass where it becomes funnier the less he
[32:08.800 --> 32:09.160]  can do
[32:10.100 --> 32:12.840]  The older and like what is viewed as a stunt
[32:12.840 --> 32:18.160]  Could become part of the comedy at the time of this recording Jackie Chan is 68 years old
[32:19.660 --> 32:22.840]  Yeah, I don't want to see that guy jump through a window
[32:24.140 --> 32:29.060]  I do that's all I want to see I want to watch a 70 year old man jump through a window
[32:29.060 --> 32:31.720]  That's awesome. And then beat somebody up with a jacket
[32:32.260 --> 32:37.920]  Absolutely, and I want to see the outtakes where he doesn't quite make it through the window two or three times. Yeah
[32:38.520 --> 32:43.980]  You know like you know like in rumble in the Bronx and the when all the post-credits scenes that we show his like oopsies and
[32:43.980 --> 32:46.400]  Accidents and a rubble in the Bronx specifically
[32:46.400 --> 32:50.660]  There's one where you can see as like a giant rubber shoe over his normal shoe to hide his cast or whatever
[32:50.660 --> 32:56.780]  I bet and the outtakes of Rush Hour 4. It's just a giant rubber bodysuit that goes over his body cast
[32:58.320 --> 32:59.400]  Walks like a stickman
[33:00.600 --> 33:03.760]  I want to see Jackie Chan fuck some people up with a walker
[33:03.760 --> 33:09.360]  Like I could just see it in my head like him grabbing it like needing to use it lifting it up fighting like six guys
[33:09.360 --> 33:13.700]  At once like he typically does I think you're right. There's room. How old is Chris Tucker?
[33:15.080 --> 33:16.920]  Chris Tucker age
[33:16.920 --> 33:18.400]  Late 50s
[33:18.400 --> 33:23.580]  51. Oh, wow. That's younger than I thought. Yeah, pretty young. Yeah, I don't know what that movie is, though
[33:23.580 --> 33:28.020]  Rush hour for like why it just feels I don't know what's left to tell
[33:28.020 --> 33:32.100]  What if the whole movie takes place in a car as they both try and drive to work?
[33:34.340 --> 33:39.200]  Why just literal just stuck in rush hour and stuck in rush hour, okay
[33:39.200 --> 33:44.200]  Maybe terrorists take over the old folks home that they both live in and they have to
[33:44.940 --> 33:45.380]  I
[33:46.740 --> 33:53.520]  Honestly, I feel like the only reason why rush hour 3 had to exist was because of the blooper and rush hour 2 of him
[33:53.520 --> 33:55.900]  Saying damn that guy's not gonna be rush hour 3
[33:56.540 --> 33:57.280]  Like that
[33:57.800 --> 34:04.060]  Validated a rush hour 3 existed and there was no blooper rush hour 3 where he was like Dan that guy gonna be rush hour
[34:04.060 --> 34:08.160]  4 it's like that's why I don't think I'm a board for rush hour 4 in the same way
[34:08.160 --> 34:12.380]  I was for 3 that ad-lib might have been the first ad-lib to Greenlight a movie
[34:13.360 --> 34:20.160]  Yeah, it completely validated a sequel existing it doesn't matter what it's about it needs to happen there needs to be a rush hour 3
[34:20.160 --> 34:25.700]  That's a great section of rush hour 2 outtakes where it's just a montage of Chris Tucker calling
[34:26.280 --> 34:29.040]  Jackie Chan Jackie instead of his character name
[34:29.800 --> 34:33.220]  To the point where he's just like yeah, let's go Jackie. Damn it and then
[34:34.040 --> 34:40.380]  And then Jackie Chan goes. Okay, Chris Tucker and like kicks the door in those outtakes are the best. They're honestly optics
[34:40.380 --> 34:45.160]  I think my favorite part of all these movies. Oh easily. Yeah, they're not great movies beyond the outtakes
[34:45.160 --> 34:50.700]  I mean, they're fun for what they are. But like the outtakes are easily the best part. I think it's interesting that
[34:51.720 --> 34:56.420]  They would even like who wants to see rush hour 4 like what is that audience? I'll see it
[34:56.420 --> 34:59.380]  Who is that? I want to see it. You are you're both. Okay, never mind
[34:59.380 --> 35:01.040]  Maybe I'm just less on board for this
[35:01.040 --> 35:07.660]  Would you if you were the director of rush hour 2 would you have serious thought of including that outtake in your final cut?
[35:07.660 --> 35:10.540]  Or because the blooper reel exists you'd be fine placing it there
[35:10.540 --> 35:12.020]  It's just such a funny line
[35:12.020 --> 35:17.380]  Like it works like it's weird that it breaks the fourth wall and it that doesn't fit the tone of those movies at all
[35:17.380 --> 35:22.100]  But it's so goddamn funny his delivering the timing of it. What you think that should just been in the cut
[35:22.100 --> 35:23.080]  I kind of yeah
[35:23.080 --> 35:27.540]  I'd be very tempted if I was making that movie to just have that be the cut because it's funnier
[35:27.540 --> 35:29.700]  It's a better moment than what's actually there
[35:31.100 --> 35:37.020]  I'm gonna what the best fourth wall break is. Oh, oh, that's a good quote. I'm gonna see what Google says
[35:37.500 --> 35:41.480]  There's a weird fourth wall break in like one of the James Bond films. Yeah
[35:41.480 --> 35:48.480]  I think it's when Sean Connery quit and George Lazerbee became Bond. He has like him like a moment to the camera
[35:48.480 --> 35:54.240]  He basically says like oh he does like oh, that's not how the other guy. Yeah, that never happened to the other fella
[35:54.240 --> 35:57.500]  I basically just like look straight down the barrel. It's so weird. Yeah
[35:57.500 --> 35:58.860]  Yeah, you're right
[35:58.860 --> 36:04.700]  Oh, I so I looked at like best fourth wall breaks of all time and number one is considered to be a Ferris Bueller
[36:04.700 --> 36:09.620]  Which I guess makes sense. I mean that whole movies like at the fourth. It's a structure. Yeah
[36:09.620 --> 36:14.800]  Yeah, I wonder what would be like the the best non-intentional one or maybe like the best ad-libbed line
[36:14.800 --> 36:16.820]  I like the moment in Spaceballs where
[36:16.820 --> 36:20.600]  They just like to start talking about the movie and then just stop talking and look down the lens
[36:20.600 --> 36:25.680]  But that's you know, like that naked gun. You always expect that to be. Oh, yeah, absolutely
[36:25.680 --> 36:31.240]  Multiple moments of that. Are they making a new naked gun, right? Are they? Yeah with Liam Neeson
[36:31.240 --> 36:34.820]  Yeah, Liam Neeson's taking over the role. I think yeah, that's interesting
[36:34.820 --> 36:39.880]  Like you figure Leslie Nielsen and Liam Neeson are close enough sounding that you it must be good
[36:39.880 --> 36:40.840]  I guess I don't know
[36:40.840 --> 36:45.980]  I mean it's a same initials so they didn't have to change anything in the trailer or the I think there is a fourth wall break
[36:45.980 --> 36:47.700]  In the naked gun, isn't there it doesn't somebody
[36:48.320 --> 36:53.620]  Fall out of frame like and they like show beyond the set where the person falls out. Oh, yeah
[36:54.400 --> 36:54.800]  Yeah
[36:55.760 --> 37:01.040]  It's like crew I think like half of Gremlins 2 if I remember correctly was fourth wall breaking as well
[37:01.040 --> 37:06.840]  Cuz it was like they did a bunch of stuff in the theater with Gremlins. That's interesting. We'll have to look into this
[37:06.840 --> 37:12.780]  I don't feel great. Yeah, you shouldn't you should feel terrible. Yeah, I feel a little I got a little rumbly tummy after that
[37:12.780 --> 37:15.260]  I already took I already God, dude
[37:15.260 --> 37:18.740]  I saw this in Alabama over the weekend visiting my family, which is great and I love them and stuff
[37:18.740 --> 37:24.240]  But you know how like Gavin, you know how like when you you say that when you come back from England you come back to America
[37:24.240 --> 37:29.000]  You start eating American food again. You just shit like crazy and you yeah
[37:29.000 --> 37:34.820]  I have the same problem with Alabama like Alabama is is is your is my version of your America?
[37:35.220 --> 37:39.280]  Well, I go back to Alabama for like three days. I come back to Texas and I just destroy toilets
[37:39.280 --> 37:45.060]  I have been what time is it 2 p.m. I have taken three heinous shits today
[37:46.760 --> 37:53.640]  Now what is different about your diet like what is the thing that's oh you don't know it's I mean it's just like I
[37:53.640 --> 37:58.560]  mean, yes, yeah Geoff we talked about you going back to Alabama and
[37:58.560 --> 38:02.080]  the one thing that you liked and it was
[38:02.080 --> 38:07.300]  banana whoopie pies that you can buy whenever you want
[38:07.300 --> 38:12.100]  You said they are in every checkout counter at every place you go to
[38:12.100 --> 38:18.280]  You talked about them two or three times when we did podcast yesterday and you don't know what changed in your diet
[38:18.280 --> 38:21.920]  Okay, that well, that's part of it for sure. I will say
[38:23.700 --> 38:28.300]  I'm not a big fan of Alabama the state love my family dearly
[38:28.300 --> 38:33.300]  Don't want my mom to hear this and think I'm saying I don't like her or my family or you know
[38:33.300 --> 38:38.480]  Yeah, I just don't like Alabama. I grew up there. I'm just not a fan. You don't have to like where you're from
[38:38.480 --> 38:41.700]  It's not a requirement and I'm allowed not to like it
[38:41.700 --> 38:45.720]  Even though a bunch of people from Alabama are gonna yell at me on social media jokes on you. I won't see it
[38:45.720 --> 38:46.700]  I'm not on social media anymore
[38:47.600 --> 38:50.020]  But I I just don't I just don't dig Alabama
[38:50.020 --> 38:51.260]  I just I'm not a fan of it
[38:51.260 --> 38:57.420]  And so I was talking about with my therapist and he he told me he was like I'm I challenge you to find one thing
[38:57.420 --> 39:02.700]  You like about Alabama while you're there like one thing that you dig about Alabama and the best I could come up with is I?
[39:02.980 --> 39:04.820]  fucking love banana moon pies and
[39:05.720 --> 39:10.700]  Banana moon pies moon pies in general. Are they like a big Mardi Gras thing if you guys don't know what I'm talking about
[39:11.600 --> 39:16.460]  They it's like the official like throw food like the big thing that they throw
[39:16.460 --> 39:18.200]  They throw beads and all kinds of candy and shit
[39:18.200 --> 39:24.760]  But they throw these things called moon pies and I fucking love banana moon pies and they are at like every impulse buy station in
[39:24.760 --> 39:27.500]  Alabama like gas stations Walmart wherever you go
[39:27.500 --> 39:31.280]  And so I ate a bunch of banana moon pies all those there and so that probably helped
[39:31.280 --> 39:35.240]  I also had I've had a lot of cereal at my mom's house
[39:35.240 --> 39:41.360]  and she just has regular milk and I have been eating lactose-free milk for a while now because
[39:42.060 --> 39:47.680]  Lactose milk makes me makes me fart. And so that's probably part of it, too. I
[39:47.680 --> 39:50.140]  Feel like that would be an incentive for you to have the milk
[39:50.140 --> 39:54.120]  That seems like a thing you'd be very excited about. What farting? I don't mind the farting
[39:54.120 --> 39:59.680]  I don't like what it does to my tummy. It makes my tummy hurt. Okay, that makes sense. In my experience anytime
[40:00.480 --> 40:02.780]  You're evacuating a different country's food
[40:03.380 --> 40:07.500]  Into the country you're in it's never a good poo. Yeah. Yeah, that's fair
[40:07.500 --> 40:12.880]  It's never a tidy one. A moon pie by name feels like it would fuck you up, but not by looking at it
[40:12.880 --> 40:16.420]  No, they're fucking great. That seems okay to me visually. Yeah, there you go
[40:16.960 --> 40:18.960]  There's a banana moon pie right there, I was just trying to grab one
[40:19.760 --> 40:25.520]  They're so fucking good, dude. Have you guys ever had one? No. No. Oh you should you should absolutely
[40:25.940 --> 40:27.980]  You should if you ever get a chance eat a moon pie
[40:30.800 --> 40:36.320]  You can shit for a while though, apparently. Well only if it's from Alabama. Speaking of eating and shitting
[40:37.440 --> 40:39.100]  Gavin are you do you want to eat that?
[40:39.460 --> 40:40.360]  Should you eat that?
[40:40.360 --> 40:45.640]  Because all the regulation listeners and comment leavers are eating their their black licorice already
[40:45.640 --> 40:49.240]  And I feel we kind of we kind of lost sight of that because of the whole
[40:49.920 --> 40:53.080]  Cucumber thing. Cucumber. But Gavin you have that licorice there
[40:53.080 --> 40:56.340]  Do you want to pop a couple of those double salts in your mouth and see what happens?
[40:56.820 --> 41:02.800]  Yeah, I guess so. Does anyone else have one? I do. I still have some. It'll probably be a fucking treat after my apple. Mildly worried
[41:02.800 --> 41:03.940]  I'm gonna vomit again
[41:03.940 --> 41:07.980]  But I gotta say as somebody who typically is in pain on this show
[41:07.980 --> 41:10.660]  This has been a nice break to just observe this
[41:10.660 --> 41:15.620]  There's one place in town where I think they might have this. I had somebody recommend a spot
[41:15.620 --> 41:20.660]  So I need to check. Double salt black licorice. I'm gonna pop this. So it's a challenge
[41:20.660 --> 41:25.720]  Is it just keeping it in your mouth or eating it within? Just trying to get it down. Just trying to get it
[41:25.720 --> 41:27.720]  Oh fuck you!
[41:31.300 --> 41:35.980]  How does that compare to your death apple? It's worse than the apple
[41:38.500 --> 41:43.420]  It's just too goddamn intense. Have you popped it in Gavin? No, I just went to get it. So I've got a bag
[41:43.880 --> 41:48.040]  I got all of the... put your camera on. I'll put mine on. Got drops
[41:49.860 --> 41:56.300]  So the ones we want are the double salt. I don't have a webcam. Oh, that's okay. That's fine
[41:56.300 --> 42:01.420]  So I'm going for the double salt one. Not cats, coins, or drops. Now, well
[42:01.920 --> 42:04.640]  No, I think you start at the double salt and then we can work our way back up
[42:04.640 --> 42:10.760]  I agree. Definitely start with the double salt. Most bang for your buck. Yeah, I'll be honest. I'm not sure I've ever had licorice
[42:10.760 --> 42:17.980]  I love licorice. This is not licorice. You mean in all contexts like red or black? Yes, all contexts
[42:17.980 --> 42:24.480]  Black licorice is my favorite. Gavin just said he's never had it. No, I've never been like a just sugary sweets guy
[42:24.480 --> 42:31.500]  So you've avoided licorice entirely? Doesn't smell it much. I wouldn't define licorice as being sweet or sugar
[42:31.500 --> 42:37.560]  Why just any like gummy sugary crap I just never went for. Yeah, I don't I don't I feel like licorice is in a different category
[42:37.560 --> 42:41.100]  Yeah, I agree. Really? Like licorice all sorts? It's like it's own thing
[42:41.100 --> 42:46.220]  All right, so I'm just putting this in my mouth on my tongue. Just see if you can eat one of those double salt licorices
[42:46.220 --> 42:52.100]  Black licorices. Okay, here we go. And I'll do it at the same time. On the count of three. I'm really, I'm really nervous
[42:52.100 --> 42:54.100]  And we'll see who spits it out
[42:54.100 --> 42:57.080]  You just have to say when you spit it out. You got this! And if you can eat it all the way
[42:57.080 --> 43:03.040]  Then you fucking win and you're a champion. All right, so on the count of three. Yeah, one, two, three
[43:03.660 --> 43:05.840]  It's definitely not gonna be...
[43:05.840 --> 43:06.420]  I can't
[43:07.400 --> 43:08.440]  Oh God
[43:08.440 --> 43:11.260]  Eww, eww, eww
[43:12.700 --> 43:14.440]  You chewed into the grape lady
[43:15.120 --> 43:15.640]  Eww
[43:16.560 --> 43:18.640]  It doesn't wanna be on there
[43:18.640 --> 43:19.320]  Eww
[43:20.680 --> 43:22.480]  It doesn't wanna be on my tongue
[43:22.480 --> 43:23.940]  There's nowhere for it to go
[43:24.420 --> 43:24.680]  Eww
[43:24.680 --> 43:25.040]  Eww
[43:27.300 --> 43:27.860]  Eww
[43:28.900 --> 43:30.440]  I wish you had a webcam
[43:34.920 --> 43:40.280]  It's like your tongue tries to eject it from your mouth as soon as it touches you
[43:40.280 --> 43:45.300]  You're not messing about, that's completely impossible, that's not food
[43:45.300 --> 43:46.620]  No, it's not
[43:47.360 --> 43:49.000]  It tastes like the ocean
[43:49.000 --> 43:50.480]  It's like a handful of salt
[43:50.480 --> 43:53.880]  Imagine my surprise when I thought I was buying regular ass
[43:53.880 --> 43:56.400]  Yummy licorice and I put that in my fucking mouth
[43:56.400 --> 43:57.860]  Try the least
[43:57.860 --> 44:00.360]  Try the mildest licorice
[44:00.360 --> 44:02.260]  Now, whatever it is, the cats
[44:02.260 --> 44:04.480]  Whichever one says it's a hint of licorice
[44:04.480 --> 44:05.540]  Try that and see how you feel
[44:05.540 --> 44:08.600]  I can't believe that that was his introduction to licorice
[44:08.600 --> 44:09.640]  Just in general
[44:09.640 --> 44:11.400]  That was his first licorice
[44:11.400 --> 44:13.940]  Drops says deliciously sweet and soft
[44:13.940 --> 44:14.620]  Try that
[44:14.620 --> 44:17.520]  Oh God, I can't get that taste away
[44:17.520 --> 44:20.100]  It would be like if your first time eating chocolate
[44:20.100 --> 44:22.000]  Was the 100% dirt chocolate
[44:22.000 --> 44:23.760]  And he's working down to 90
[44:24.760 --> 44:27.300]  The craziest scale that you're working backwards from
[44:27.300 --> 44:28.700]  Alright, this is going in now
[44:28.700 --> 44:29.540]  The, uh
[44:30.420 --> 44:30.860]  Drops
[44:31.740 --> 44:34.040]  Okay, in comparison to the other one, it doesn't taste like anything
[44:34.540 --> 44:36.480]  Yeah, it's just like a little bit of anise
[44:36.480 --> 44:38.240]  I guess, is the flavor
[44:38.240 --> 44:38.840]  You know
[44:38.840 --> 44:41.240]  Do you like the taste of the licorice, Gavin?
[44:41.640 --> 44:43.440]  Oh, that reminds me of something
[44:43.440 --> 44:45.140]  Tastes like medicine I've had
[44:45.580 --> 44:47.320]  Tastes like NyQuil, a little bit
[44:47.780 --> 44:50.060]  Have you guys watched the video, I'll link it here
[44:50.060 --> 44:51.820]  It has the timestamp on it
[44:51.820 --> 44:53.600]  Did you see Vinny
[44:54.260 --> 44:55.820]  A comment leaver
[44:55.820 --> 44:57.460]  Ah underscore Vinny
[44:57.460 --> 44:58.860]  On the subreddit
[44:58.860 --> 45:02.300]  He took the double salt black licorice challenge
[45:02.300 --> 45:04.440]  And I think he makes it
[45:04.440 --> 45:05.180]  30 seconds
[45:05.180 --> 45:07.180]  It's the same kind of thing
[45:07.180 --> 45:08.600]  It's great, it's on YouTube
[45:08.600 --> 45:09.840]  Should we watch this?
[45:10.160 --> 45:14.440]  His fucking setup in the background is amazing
[45:14.440 --> 45:16.580]  Look at all of the peanut butter
[45:16.580 --> 45:17.920]  And soup and pencils
[45:17.920 --> 45:19.120]  There's a bunch of pencils
[45:19.980 --> 45:20.860]  He's like
[45:21.860 --> 45:24.280]  He grabs a handful
[45:24.280 --> 45:25.440]  He's tough
[45:26.380 --> 45:27.800]  His face
[45:27.800 --> 45:30.120]  He looks like he doesn't know
[45:30.120 --> 45:30.900]  Where he is anymore
[45:31.680 --> 45:33.100]  Yeah, it goes out
[45:33.100 --> 45:36.060]  He immediately
[45:36.060 --> 45:37.820]  Loses all familiarity
[45:37.820 --> 45:38.720]  With the surroundings
[45:38.720 --> 45:40.240]  He doesn't know where to go
[45:40.240 --> 45:42.720]  He's trying to run away
[45:43.760 --> 45:44.920]  He's deciding
[45:44.920 --> 45:46.740]  He's thinking about it
[45:46.740 --> 45:48.060]  He can't
[45:48.060 --> 45:50.840]  He muted the vomiting part
[45:52.060 --> 45:53.260]  He tries
[45:53.260 --> 45:54.700]  Like he's gonna throw up
[45:54.700 --> 45:56.760]  And then stops and then can't
[45:56.760 --> 45:58.520]  Like, it's vile
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.240]  Wow, that's a great challenge
[46:05.240 --> 46:07.020]  Yeah, you can watch it on YouTube
[46:07.020 --> 46:08.400]  We'll link it in the description
[46:08.400 --> 46:10.260]  But it's on
[46:10.820 --> 46:12.660]  His YouTube channel is Vintage TV
[46:12.660 --> 46:14.300]  He's done a couple of these
[46:14.300 --> 46:16.600]  He did a Cosmic Crisp
[46:16.600 --> 46:17.880]  Apple Pie
[46:17.880 --> 46:20.760]  He tried to see how many
[46:20.760 --> 46:22.820]  Darts it would take for him to get a bullseye
[46:22.820 --> 46:23.660]  Blindfolded
[46:23.660 --> 46:26.260]  He made the four dipping sauces as well
[46:26.260 --> 46:28.440]  Yeah, he tries the 100%
[46:29.320 --> 46:31.180]  The 100% dark chocolate
[46:31.180 --> 46:32.160]  He really
[46:32.160 --> 46:33.160]  He goes for it
[46:33.160 --> 46:35.220]  I gotta watch this guy's background
[46:35.220 --> 46:36.780]  He has some good stuff, dude
[46:36.780 --> 46:37.800]  He's a fucking legend
[46:37.800 --> 46:38.900]  Yeah, definitely
[46:38.900 --> 46:42.000]  If you are a regulation listener or a comment leaver
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.100]  Go subscribe to his YouTube channel and watch his stuff
[46:44.100 --> 46:44.900]  He's really funny
[46:44.900 --> 46:47.520]  And he, by the way, did a way better job
[46:47.520 --> 46:49.020]  Eating that licorice than Gavin or I did
[46:49.640 --> 46:52.000]  I love licorice and I couldn't make it
[46:52.000 --> 46:52.900]  As long as Gavin did
[46:52.900 --> 46:55.160]  It was like, it felt like
[46:55.160 --> 46:57.920]  When you put butter on a hot frying pan
[46:57.920 --> 46:58.740]  It just slides around
[46:58.740 --> 47:01.520]  My tongue didn't want it at any point
[47:01.520 --> 47:02.640]  It just kept moving it around
[47:02.640 --> 47:03.740]  It just made it so much worse
[47:03.740 --> 47:06.160]  I've never heard anyone say
[47:06.160 --> 47:08.480]  Just your panic
[47:08.480 --> 47:09.100]  In the moment
[47:09.760 --> 47:11.220]  It's stuck on the tongue
[47:11.740 --> 47:13.280]  There's no place to hide it
[47:13.280 --> 47:16.000]  Now that you've had 100% dark chocolate licorice
[47:16.000 --> 47:17.880]  What do you think of bog standard regular licorice?
[47:18.380 --> 47:18.940]  Black licorice
[47:18.940 --> 47:20.220]  It's really nice, actually
[47:20.220 --> 47:23.240]  That might actually be the best way into licorice
[47:23.240 --> 47:25.080]  It's so refreshing
[47:25.740 --> 47:27.260]  It's such a welcomed flavor
[47:27.260 --> 47:29.680]  After the heinous dog shit
[47:29.680 --> 47:31.300]  That came before it
[47:31.300 --> 47:32.100]  It's...
[47:32.100 --> 47:34.620]  I just had a rough day on my mouth, man
[47:36.040 --> 47:37.620]  You're probably not tasting apple anymore
[47:37.620 --> 47:38.680]  No, I'm not
[47:38.680 --> 47:40.420]  I'm just tasting fucking salty
[47:40.420 --> 47:44.780]  I need to track this down
[47:45.130 --> 47:47.240]  I don't understand how it could be that bad
[47:47.240 --> 47:49.100]  Is it just extreme salt taste
[47:49.100 --> 47:50.900]  Or what is the overwhelming flavor
[47:50.900 --> 47:53.140]  It's salt, but it's more than that
[47:53.140 --> 47:53.920]  I'm gonna put it in again
[47:53.920 --> 47:54.860]  It's like...
[47:58.480 --> 47:59.440]  It almost...
[47:59.440 --> 48:00.380]  It's almost...
[48:01.960 --> 48:03.900]  It's almost so much salt
[48:03.900 --> 48:06.160]  It burns, but not like a hot burn
[48:06.160 --> 48:08.060]  Just like the reaction
[48:08.060 --> 48:09.860]  Of burning without the heat, if that makes sense
[48:09.860 --> 48:12.120]  I feel like it's a good indicator
[48:12.120 --> 48:13.680]  Of what it's like to be a slug
[48:13.680 --> 48:14.660]  When someone pulls someone
[48:15.800 --> 48:17.820]  Have you ever got slammed
[48:17.820 --> 48:19.980]  By an ocean wave, Andrew?
[48:20.120 --> 48:22.020]  Like in the mouth and it goes up your nose
[48:22.020 --> 48:23.760]  Oh yeah, oh no
[48:23.760 --> 48:25.140]  That is what this tastes like
[48:25.140 --> 48:27.240]  It tastes like getting slammed by an ocean wave
[48:27.240 --> 48:29.040]  That's one of the worst feelings
[48:29.640 --> 48:30.940]  It's always so gross
[48:30.940 --> 48:33.440]  You want to get it out of your mouth so fast
[48:33.440 --> 48:35.580]  But it sticks around, it's bad
[48:35.580 --> 48:38.040]  Okay, that is a great descriptor
[48:38.040 --> 48:39.760]  Of what that's like, that's horrendous
[48:39.760 --> 48:40.340]  It's pretty bad
[48:40.340 --> 48:42.780]  I'm gonna do my best
[48:43.380 --> 48:44.320]  Track that down
[48:44.320 --> 48:47.180]  I would say I've spent a lot of time in the ocean in my life
[48:47.180 --> 48:49.120]  And it's never been as bad as eating that licorice
[48:49.120 --> 48:50.040]  Oh god
[48:50.960 --> 48:53.060]  I was trying to pull a prank on Dan
[48:53.060 --> 48:53.820]  Recently, where
[48:54.560 --> 48:56.780]  I like the sort of dynamic
[48:56.780 --> 48:58.860]  Between Dan and myself in videos
[48:58.860 --> 49:01.000]  Like he doesn't know anything about
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.100]  Our camera equipment or how to use
[49:03.100 --> 49:05.040]  Any of the cameras that we've been filming with for like
[49:05.040 --> 49:05.940]  12 years
[49:05.940 --> 49:07.660]  Or anything for that matter
[49:07.660 --> 49:09.440]  He knows some stuff
[49:09.440 --> 49:12.160]  He's really good at helping people get lasso achievements
[49:13.060 --> 49:14.920]  He's great at that, especially when they
[49:14.920 --> 49:17.180]  Are incapable of playing Halo
[49:17.180 --> 49:19.300]  I went to do a video
[49:19.300 --> 49:21.160]  Where I was like running him through some of the new
[49:21.640 --> 49:22.840]  Equipment, like presenting like
[49:22.840 --> 49:25.240]  Here's a rundown of all the equipment we used, but I wanted to sneak
[49:25.240 --> 49:27.220]  In a load of stuff that wasn't
[49:27.220 --> 49:29.560]  Camera equipment, like sex toys
[49:29.560 --> 49:30.900]  Like I wanted to use a butt plug
[49:30.900 --> 49:33.360]  And like say that it was some sort of like wireless receiver
[49:33.360 --> 49:35.100]  And like bolt it to the side of the camera
[49:35.100 --> 49:36.720]  And see if I could fool him with that
[49:36.720 --> 49:39.160]  I ended up just not making this video because it's a little bit
[49:39.160 --> 49:40.120]  A little bit blue
[49:41.180 --> 49:43.280]  But while I was looking to buy
[49:43.280 --> 49:45.040]  Butt plugs, I was like
[49:45.040 --> 49:46.840]  I wonder if Amazon sells butt plugs
[49:46.840 --> 49:49.160]  Oh yeah, they got all this
[49:49.160 --> 49:50.940]  Sex stuff. The very first
[49:50.940 --> 49:52.600]  Butt plug I used, like one of the
[49:52.600 --> 49:54.880]  Like down by the reviews is like
[49:54.880 --> 49:56.140]  Frequently asked questions
[49:57.540 --> 49:59.300]  The first question was
[49:59.920 --> 50:01.060]  Is it safe to
[50:01.060 --> 50:02.940]  Leave in while I run errands?
[50:04.700 --> 50:05.840]  Did you ask that?
[50:06.300 --> 50:07.980]  No, it was on the list already
[50:07.980 --> 50:10.820]  I appreciate what you're doing here
[50:10.820 --> 50:12.780]  You're dunking on this person
[50:12.780 --> 50:14.960]  But you're the one who asked
[50:14.960 --> 50:16.860]  What is the blowjob device for?
[50:17.020 --> 50:18.400]  Is that for you or like
[50:18.400 --> 50:19.820]  That was you
[50:20.420 --> 50:22.220]  You asked if you would practice
[50:22.720 --> 50:25.040]  You have no ground to take shots
[50:25.040 --> 50:26.160]  At anyone on this subject
[50:26.160 --> 50:28.620]  When it comes to sex toys
[50:28.620 --> 50:29.500]  I don't know what I'm doing
[50:29.500 --> 50:32.540]  Don't forget though, Andrew is on your side here
[50:32.540 --> 50:33.920]  Oh yeah, 100%
[50:34.400 --> 50:35.120]  With you
[50:35.660 --> 50:36.440]  Is it safe?
[50:37.600 --> 50:40.740]  Apparently it's perfectly safe to leave in while you
[50:40.740 --> 50:42.880]  While you snoop around Target
[50:42.880 --> 50:44.460]  Now I'm just like concerned
[50:44.460 --> 50:46.380]  How many people have stuff in?
[50:48.520 --> 50:50.980]  Oh no, it's like that statistic
[50:50.980 --> 50:52.460]  Of like how many people
[50:52.460 --> 50:54.660]  Like one in however many have killed someone
[50:54.660 --> 50:56.000]  So if you're at like a stadium
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.140]  Like statistically someone there is a murderer
[50:58.140 --> 51:01.480]  You're like in a Target and be like someone in here has got a butt plug in
[51:01.480 --> 51:04.560]  Have I ever shaken the hand of someone with a butt plug in?
[51:04.800 --> 51:07.160]  Oh, I feel like statistically most likely
[51:07.160 --> 51:08.420]  Has to have happened, right?
[51:08.420 --> 51:09.580]  Has to have happened
[51:09.580 --> 51:12.500]  Should we do a thing like with Nick and the monkey mask
[51:12.500 --> 51:14.940]  Where Gavin has to put a butt plug in in one episode
[51:14.940 --> 51:16.880]  And we have to guess which one it is
[51:18.840 --> 51:21.000]  I think you'd be able to tell pretty quickly
[51:21.420 --> 51:23.240]  Gavin, do you have the butt plug in right now?
[51:23.780 --> 51:24.660]  Uh, I do not
[51:24.660 --> 51:25.880]  Alright, we'll try it next time
[51:26.320 --> 51:27.460]  We'll try it in 137
[51:27.460 --> 51:29.640]  How long did it take Dan to realize?
[51:30.340 --> 51:31.500]  I just didn't do it in the end
[51:31.500 --> 51:32.840]  Okay, you just didn't do it at all
[51:33.540 --> 51:34.260]  That's disappointing
[51:34.260 --> 51:36.420]  I didn't have enough in between
[51:36.420 --> 51:37.440]  The butt plug
[51:37.440 --> 51:39.680]  I wanted an escalation
[51:39.680 --> 51:41.300]  To see how ridiculous it could get
[51:41.300 --> 51:44.120]  Sometimes thinking of a prank is as good as doing it
[51:44.620 --> 51:48.100]  I feel like I got a few chuckles just from the concept
[51:48.100 --> 51:49.160]  I didn't mean to necessarily
[51:49.160 --> 51:51.880]  I think most of my pranks instead of
[51:51.880 --> 51:53.600]  Put the effort into them anymore
[51:54.300 --> 51:56.040]  You hit an age where you're like
[51:56.040 --> 51:58.040]  The mind's eye is funny enough
[51:58.040 --> 51:59.880]  I really wanted to
[51:59.880 --> 52:02.520]  When we were in the height of cucumber paranoia
[52:02.520 --> 52:07.040]  Gavin, when you were away in Japan, I thought it'd be so funny if through, like, your Ring
[52:07.040 --> 52:11.680]  Doorbell cam, you just saw the port-a-potty getting dropped off with a cucumber-like tape
[52:11.680 --> 52:16.380]  to it. Like, not even at all subtle, but just the idea of you being in a different country
[52:16.380 --> 52:19.720]  knowing that that's just on your doorstep waiting for you.
[52:19.740 --> 52:28.860]  You'd probably do it the day I left as well. Wow, between that vom and the licorice, I'm
[52:28.860 --> 52:31.140]  struggling to talk. It's not easy.
[52:31.140 --> 52:35.140]  Is this our last recording of this year, or do we have another one after this?
[52:35.240 --> 52:39.320]  No, no, this is the last one of this year. This'll come out on the 11th, but this is
[52:39.320 --> 52:40.140]  the last one of this year.
[52:40.180 --> 52:41.900]  So this'll come out the 11th of January?
[52:42.320 --> 52:45.800]  That is correct, yeah. We could try to put it out the 11th of December, but it is the
[52:45.800 --> 52:46.880]  20th, so I don't think that's correct.
[52:46.880 --> 52:47.320]  Fair enough.
[52:47.520 --> 52:48.420]  What about the 29th?
[52:48.920 --> 52:50.120]  Oh, I'm around.
[52:50.680 --> 52:51.820]  Why would we do that?
[52:51.980 --> 52:52.500]  On Thursday?
[52:52.980 --> 52:53.900]  What are you talking about?
[52:54.080 --> 52:56.480]  Why wouldn't we record again on the 29th of December?
[52:56.480 --> 52:59.300]  Oh, I thought he was saying, why don't we put this out on the 29th?
[52:59.300 --> 53:00.520]  Yeah, that's what my confusion was too.
[53:01.040 --> 53:02.760]  But isn't that just a normal Thursday?
[53:03.000 --> 53:06.980]  I mean, yeah, we can record if you want to.
[53:07.200 --> 53:07.420]  I do.
[53:07.480 --> 53:08.220]  I got no problem with it.
[53:08.500 --> 53:09.100]  I want to record.
[53:09.400 --> 53:10.240]  Okay, let's do it.
[53:10.580 --> 53:11.660]  I mean, it's not day off, is it?
[53:12.160 --> 53:12.360]  No.
[53:12.700 --> 53:13.980]  I mean, yes, but okay.
[53:14.120 --> 53:14.420]  Is it?
[53:14.760 --> 53:15.300]  It's a holiday?
[53:15.720 --> 53:20.580]  The week is when our studio is dark, so yeah, technically, but we can still record.
[53:20.900 --> 53:25.140]  Oh, well, listen, I don't want to... if you guys are doing shit, I don't want to...
[53:25.140 --> 53:26.220]  This show is easy.
[53:26.400 --> 53:30.580]  This is... the record of this is the easiest part of this show.
[53:30.960 --> 53:34.480]  Everything else is difficult, but the actual record of this show is the easiest part of
[53:34.480 --> 53:34.640]  this show.
[53:34.660 --> 53:35.640]  I feel the same way.
[53:35.700 --> 53:38.940]  It's like, if we're all going to be just sitting around, dicking around with our thumbs up
[53:38.940 --> 53:43.760]  our asses or our dildos up our asses, you know, fucking trying to figure out how to
[53:43.760 --> 53:48.060]  work our blowjob machines, we might as well get together and spend an hour telling jokes.
[53:48.700 --> 53:53.720]  Well, I'm trying to figure out if it's for me or on me or I do it and I still can't
[53:53.720 --> 53:54.080]  crack it.
[53:54.080 --> 53:57.220]  I will say that I've struggled for a long time and figuring it out.
[53:57.300 --> 54:02.120]  But ever since I left the manual in my bathroom, it has been so much easier to process.
[54:02.480 --> 54:07.320]  I had to install brighter bulbs so that I could read with my sunglasses on, but it works.
[54:08.140 --> 54:12.620]  Let me let me ask you guys one last question, because I think we're about to wrap up.
[54:12.680 --> 54:15.480]  It sounds like we may or may not record one more episode this year.
[54:15.480 --> 54:20.400]  But if we don't, and this is the last episode of the year, even if it isn't, like, how would
[54:20.400 --> 54:23.200]  you guys like what do you think 2022 was for F*** Face?
[54:23.200 --> 54:25.400]  How would you like the year of F*** Face?
[54:25.980 --> 54:27.920]  What do you think defined F*** Face in 2022?
[54:28.600 --> 54:31.220]  That's a tough question.
[54:31.380 --> 54:32.680]  To me, this was the year of growth.
[54:32.940 --> 54:33.140]  Yeah.
[54:33.380 --> 54:40.060]  Like we got we got so much bigger, not just numbers wise, but the idea and like the scope.
[54:40.660 --> 54:48.660]  We bought Jackie Chan's tuxedo from the movie Tuxedo and Andrew relentlessly messaged the
[54:48.660 --> 54:49.640]  director of the film.
[54:50.100 --> 54:54.300]  I don't know another show that's doing that kind of thing.
[54:54.640 --> 54:58.940]  Along those same lines, I would describe it as the year of supplemental content, like
[54:58.940 --> 55:01.140]  where we really we really came into our own.
[55:01.280 --> 55:03.380]  And I want 2023 to knock it out of the park.
[55:03.440 --> 55:07.040]  Like I want to double or triple the amount of supplemental content we did.
[55:07.280 --> 55:08.460]  But we did Eric's job.
[55:08.800 --> 55:09.880]  We did the tuxedo.
[55:10.500 --> 55:14.120]  We did Geoff at the plate, like 30 videos of that.
[55:14.420 --> 55:16.640]  Gavin's overkill, a ton of break shows.
[55:16.700 --> 55:18.160]  We did the beanhole.
[55:18.580 --> 55:20.420]  We did the tuxedo auction.
[55:20.780 --> 55:24.680]  We did two episodes of Does It Do and only two episodes of Does It Do.
[55:25.740 --> 55:27.520]  We did sausage talk.
[55:27.540 --> 55:28.260]  Oh, trust me, I know.
[55:28.760 --> 55:30.520]  We did the alphabet supplemental.
[55:31.000 --> 55:35.040]  We did four fucking or probably by this point, five regulation animations.
[55:35.700 --> 55:37.320]  We were we did the pizza video.
[55:37.520 --> 55:39.580]  We did Plowman and pizza day.
[55:39.860 --> 55:40.920]  We did...
[55:40.920 --> 55:41.500]  Pizza day?
[55:41.840 --> 55:42.220]  What the fuck?
[55:42.240 --> 55:42.780]  What else did we do?
[55:42.980 --> 55:43.260]  We did.
[55:43.260 --> 55:43.740]  Oh, we did.
[55:43.920 --> 55:47.120]  We did the fall snake ladder.
[55:47.380 --> 55:47.980]  Oh, that's right.
[55:47.980 --> 55:48.140]  Yeah.
[55:48.140 --> 55:48.680]  That'll come out.
[55:48.800 --> 55:49.540]  We did best of 2022.
[55:50.100 --> 55:51.420]  Yeah, that'll come out next year.
[55:51.520 --> 55:59.860]  The best falls will come out next year, will come in 2023, but we'll have the the our retrospective
[55:59.860 --> 56:02.940]  or our favorite things of 2022 will be out before the end of the year.
[56:03.000 --> 56:03.420]  So that's good.
[56:03.600 --> 56:04.960]  It was a great year for f***face.
[56:05.180 --> 56:06.700]  I'm so excited for next year.
[56:07.040 --> 56:08.680]  We like we got outside this year.
[56:09.000 --> 56:09.940]  We got outside.
[56:10.160 --> 56:10.320]  Yes.
[56:10.520 --> 56:12.940]  Next year, we just need to get outside and sort of converge.
[56:13.240 --> 56:13.540]  Yeah.
[56:14.160 --> 56:16.120]  Will we see Andrew in 2023?
[56:16.120 --> 56:18.840]  I think I'll see him at the Olympics in February if we do it.
[56:20.260 --> 56:20.780]  I do.
[56:20.860 --> 56:22.140]  I think I think that's a great way to put it.
[56:22.200 --> 56:26.660]  Like 2022 was the year of, like, growth and creating extra supplemental content.
[56:27.320 --> 56:28.980]  2023 could be the year we do it together.
[56:29.260 --> 56:29.520]  Maybe.
[56:29.860 --> 56:30.380]  Oh, nice.
[56:30.540 --> 56:30.960]  I like that.
[56:31.100 --> 56:31.420]  I want.
[56:31.540 --> 56:31.680]  Yeah.
[56:31.680 --> 56:38.360]  My goal for 2023 is to clear up any outstanding show related debts I have.
[56:39.100 --> 56:40.180]  You sure you want to say that?
[56:41.240 --> 56:41.880]  Previous year.
[56:42.120 --> 56:43.060]  Now I said that's my goal.
[56:43.100 --> 56:43.860]  I didn't say I'd do it.
[56:43.900 --> 56:44.620]  That's my goal, though.
[56:44.620 --> 56:47.620]  This is like New Year's resolutions where you claim things and then they don't actually
[56:47.620 --> 56:47.920]  come through.
[56:48.060 --> 56:50.300]  It's my goal, but I'm not going to do it.
[56:50.580 --> 56:54.660]  Yeah, that's what a New Year's resolution is, which is what we're doing right now.
[56:55.180 --> 56:58.800]  So I'm declaring I outside of, you know, the pencil.
[56:58.940 --> 56:59.400]  Who knows?
[56:59.540 --> 57:00.200]  There's a case.
[57:00.360 --> 57:01.620]  You know, it's very up for debate.
[57:01.680 --> 57:02.280]  A lot of questions.
[57:02.460 --> 57:02.860]  Who's right?
[57:02.880 --> 57:03.200]  Who's wrong?
[57:03.220 --> 57:03.460]  Who knows?
[57:03.700 --> 57:07.940]  But everything else I think I can clear by the end of that year.
[57:08.220 --> 57:08.480]  OK.
[57:08.880 --> 57:10.040]  At least attempting to do so.
[57:10.320 --> 57:10.680]  Everything.
[57:11.000 --> 57:11.340]  Everything.
[57:11.560 --> 57:11.940]  The marathon.
[57:12.380 --> 57:12.580]  Yeah.
[57:12.580 --> 57:12.660]  Yeah.
[57:12.660 --> 57:13.400]  The marathon mainly.
[57:13.660 --> 57:14.820]  I think that's the main thing I have.
[57:14.920 --> 57:16.100]  I think I have to do two.
[57:16.340 --> 57:17.540]  Two sets of it.
[57:17.840 --> 57:22.900]  No, I have to do it three, but I think I have two different outstanding debts relating to
[57:22.900 --> 57:23.300]  a marathon.
[57:23.600 --> 57:23.700]  Yeah.
[57:24.200 --> 57:29.600]  So this, I think we'll check again if we record one more at the end of the year, but ankle
[57:29.600 --> 57:30.360]  status at the moment?
[57:30.580 --> 57:30.900]  Great.
[57:31.260 --> 57:31.800]  Really good.
[57:32.020 --> 57:32.440]  I'm going to be honest.
[57:34.020 --> 57:36.000]  Terrible, terrible ankle year for the start.
[57:36.280 --> 57:37.300]  Yeah, I'd say close to 100.
[57:38.240 --> 57:39.260]  I've made changes.
[57:39.520 --> 57:41.880]  I made some realizations regarding my ankles.
[57:41.880 --> 57:42.820]  We're doing pretty good.
[57:43.000 --> 57:47.640]  I don't think that here's the difference from when we started the show to now.
[57:47.960 --> 57:51.320]  My burger confidence has reduced dramatically.
[57:51.520 --> 57:54.120]  I'm now much more of a realist and a lot of things.
[57:54.340 --> 57:58.020]  I don't think there's any way I'm going to be able to pull off these marathons, but I'm
[57:58.020 --> 57:58.700]  at least going to try.
[57:58.980 --> 58:00.700]  I'll make the attempt because I committed to it.
[58:00.800 --> 58:01.040]  OK.
[58:01.300 --> 58:03.040]  I miss your burger confidence.
[58:03.260 --> 58:04.980]  I feel like we got so much good content out of that.
[58:05.100 --> 58:09.000]  It goes in and out, you know, like I'll have the gamer score thing, which I think I would
[58:09.000 --> 58:12.980]  have been 150,000 short based off of what I currently have.
[58:13.080 --> 58:16.680]  But I still I still believe it's just in a different way.
[58:16.720 --> 58:17.740]  Like the Halo bet.
[58:17.820 --> 58:18.720]  We do another Halo bet.
[58:18.820 --> 58:20.060]  I'm 100 percent confident on that.
[58:20.100 --> 58:24.420]  Almost any gaming bet, any screenshot thing with you, Gavin, I feel confident about.
[58:24.760 --> 58:27.760]  Maybe 2023 could see a lot more bets.
[58:28.200 --> 58:28.420]  Maybe.
[58:28.880 --> 58:31.880]  Geoff, have you have you cooked the tomahawk steak before?
[58:32.180 --> 58:32.880]  Yeah, of course.
[58:33.100 --> 58:33.720]  OK, great.
[58:33.820 --> 58:34.540]  OK, I'm just curious.
[58:34.680 --> 58:35.500]  What about Wagyu?
[58:35.580 --> 58:36.500]  You have experience with Wagyu?
[58:36.720 --> 58:38.540]  I've never cooked the Wagyu steak, but I've eaten it.
[58:38.540 --> 58:39.880]  OK, tomahawk.
[58:39.980 --> 58:40.680]  I'll lean there.
[58:40.720 --> 58:43.960]  I'm just thinking about my steak cuts with this cucumber bed because we're almost done
[58:43.960 --> 58:44.680]  there as well.
[58:45.180 --> 58:48.760]  So I still have 11 days to get some Monopoly money on your door.
[58:49.040 --> 58:49.700]  Yeah, you do.
[58:49.900 --> 58:50.780]  I'm not worried about it.
[58:50.880 --> 58:51.640]  It's a blizzard.
[58:51.820 --> 58:53.860]  And I also have a way to know where you are now.
[58:53.960 --> 58:55.340]  So I'm not worried.
[58:55.900 --> 58:57.460]  What's your way to know where he is?
[58:57.800 --> 59:01.620]  I'm not going to tell you because then you might do something to change it.
[59:01.800 --> 59:04.020]  But Andrew has air tagged Gavin.
[59:04.520 --> 59:05.040]  I have a way.
[59:05.600 --> 59:05.920]  I will.
[59:06.120 --> 59:06.560]  How about this?
[59:06.560 --> 59:07.740]  I will very quickly.
[59:07.880 --> 59:14.000]  I'll text you, Geoff, OK, how I can track where Gavin is and you can confirm if it's
[59:14.000 --> 59:15.620]  like an actual valid, like real thing.
[59:15.740 --> 59:16.140]  All right.
[59:16.220 --> 59:16.580]  Text me.
[59:17.000 --> 59:18.200]  I'm texting you right now.
[59:18.260 --> 59:21.020]  I don't see a way that would be effective.
[59:21.420 --> 59:26.560]  Oh, it's incredibly effective and there's nothing you can do about it currently without
[59:26.560 --> 59:27.300]  you becoming aware.
[59:27.940 --> 59:28.460]  Oh, shit.
[59:28.640 --> 59:28.840]  Yeah.
[59:28.880 --> 59:30.280]  He knows where you are at all times.
[59:32.680 --> 59:33.460]  It's no joke.
[59:34.140 --> 59:34.300]  What?
[59:34.600 --> 59:35.120]  It's a joke.
[59:35.120 --> 59:37.020]  Now, here's the difficulty I have.
[59:37.760 --> 59:41.680]  I am available to hire as independent contractor for pranks.
[59:41.920 --> 59:45.360]  I just completed my contract with Andrew last week in the Cucumbers.
[59:45.640 --> 59:47.520]  I am available if Gavin wants to hire me.
[59:47.800 --> 59:49.840]  But I now know this information.
[59:50.080 --> 59:55.120]  I would I got to get out of the gate and say, Gavin, if you hire me, I can't tell you this
[59:55.120 --> 59:55.820]  like this.
[59:55.820 --> 01:00:00.180]  I can't hire you as a P.I. to investigate and prevent and hide me.
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:01.700]  I don't think so.
[01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:03.640]  And I don't think it's fair that I...
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.760]  Can I hire you for cloaking abilities?
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:10.860]  I think you might have to hire Eric or somebody who doesn't know what Gavin, what Andrew has
[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:11.260]  on you.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:13.980]  How has he infiltrated my inner circle?
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.000]  He did a pretty...
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:16.660]  We'll talk about it.
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:19.740]  Hey, I guess if we record again, I'll tell you.
[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:21.040]  He's pretty, he's pretty impressive.
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:21.500]  Next year.
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.860]  I'll trade you the information for the number.
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:25.100]  I'll trade it for...
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:29.180]  I'll trade that in January, January 1st, I'll make that trade with you.
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:33.920]  There's no way I could... that you could possibly know that I'm flying somewhere.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.720]  Yeah, I have a way.
[01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:37.420]  He's got a way.
[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:39.600]  There just isn't one.
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:41.820]  Yeah, it's impressive too.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.180]  I never would have thought it.
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:48.320]  It's so fucking dumb and simple and easy and I went like, oh yeah, of course that would
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:48.460]  work.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.780]  Did he freaking move next door?
[01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:53.760]  And also, by the way, I don't think this is spoiling anything.
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:55.600]  He has the same thing over me.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:58.180]  So he would be able to tell if I went to Canada with you two.
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:00:59.520]  So...
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.100]  Dude, there's no way.
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:02.180]  We'll talk about it later.
[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:04.720]  I have a question for you and this is... you're not going to do this anyway.
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.480]  As a side, I just had this thought last night.
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:11.100]  Is your front door, whatever door is at the front of your place?
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:15.960]  I thought last night, what if I took my bathroom door and put it where my front door is and
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.600]  move my front door to my bathroom?
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:20.780]  Would my bathroom door then just become my front door?
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:21.140]  Yes.
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:22.280]  Or is... okay.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.860]  I think you should still do it.
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:24.740]  I think that'd be hilarious.
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:28.080]  Will it be easier for me to screw the money to your bathroom door?
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:28.640]  Oh yeah.
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:29.800]  Absolutely it would.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:30.780]  Solid wood.
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:31.900]  They fucked up.
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:32.900]  I don't know what they're doing.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.100]  But my bathroom door, way more secure.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.200]  You have a solid wood bathroom door?
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:37.800]  Yeah.
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:38.260]  Dang.
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:39.120]  Where am I?
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.160]  Where are you?
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:40.780]  You're in Austin.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.640]  I don't understand what the ones that try to prove.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:46.620]  Hell yeah, I got them.
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:52.420]  Like, is it because, like, my... does my Discord or Slack say where I am?
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:53.120]  No.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:54.840]  I just, I have a way.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.320]  I'm inside your circle.
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.660]  It says Andrew Pantin, DG Geoff, and I don't see anything.
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:01.540]  I could leave the state now and you wouldn't know where I went.
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:02.520]  You can think that.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.620]  I'm okay with you thinking that.
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:04.560]  I just don't.
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:08.680]  Anyway, January will also be the year of reveals, I think, for this show.
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:08.980]  There you go.
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:10.020]  I'll talk about...
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:12.420]  I'm assuming that they haven't talked to you already.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:13.380]  It's a long month.
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:14.300]  About...
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:15.640]  Uh...
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.320]  The Austin thing.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:21.280]  Hopefully, hopefully 2023 will also be the year we get the bussy bus, or at least get
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:21.900]  a lead on it.
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:22.800]  I don't want to drop it.
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:23.740]  Oh, thank you for reminding me.
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:23.900]  I don't want to forget about that.
[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:28.380]  I really want to do some investigation and figure out if we can get a hold of that bus
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:30.140]  because I really do want to make this museum.
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:36.920]  And hopefully 2023 is the year that we get a piece of movie memorabilia from MVP or MVP2.
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:37.980]  Ideally MVP2.
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:38.880]  That was great.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:39.800]  Good episodes.
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:40.500]  Yeah.
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:41.280]  Good episodes.
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:42.360]  Pretty, uh...
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:42.540]  Yeah.
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:44.260]  I always like the doubles.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.800]  I like them because you never know what you're going to get in the second episode.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  But it's always good.
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:49.920]  We went a long way.
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:50.740]  Yeah, we did.
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:54.620]  I'm in a rage from my gigantic head to Gavin's paranoia.
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.340]  Dude, you know what I'm excited about?
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:57.760]  What are you excited about?
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:58.640]  Episode what?
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:01.780]  134, I guess, just came or 133 just came out.
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.600]  So the next episode is the Cucumber reveal.
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:04.900]  Oh, yeah.
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:05.820]  I'm very excited about that too.
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:09.340]  I'm so, so, so excited for the audience to see that and hear that.
[01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:10.200]  I hope they enjoy it.
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:10.820]  Yeah, I do too.
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:11.720]  I think it's going to be a...
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.920]  I'm hoping it's not a letdown because I think it would be an awesome moment.
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:17.480]  I think it'd be like a top, top tier moment in the podcast.
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:18.560]  I agree completely.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:23.460]  And the only thing that'll be better is if Gavin tapes a Monopoly money to your front door without you realizing it.
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:24.760]  Well, I'm going to screw it, but yeah.
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:25.520]  I'll screw it.
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:26.220]  You can't screw it.
[01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.790]  There's a car.
[01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:35.310]  I went out on the very...
[01:03:35.310 --> 01:03:41.530]  I've lived here for a few years at this point, and there's a secondary balcony that I have
[01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:42.710]  that I've never been on.
[01:03:42.790 --> 01:03:44.550]  I've just had no use for going onto it.
[01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:49.510]  And I walked onto it the other night as a car was pulling up, just a random vehicle.
[01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:52.130]  And I thought, how fucking funny it would be if this was Gavin.
[01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:57.170]  That in like the three years I've lived here, I've never been in this position before.
[01:03:57.290 --> 01:04:00.050]  And I just, coincidentally, it'd be perfect.
[01:04:00.610 --> 01:04:01.570]  But I'm not, I'm not scared.
[01:04:01.790 --> 01:04:03.010]  I'm not, I'm not terrified.
[01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:03.870]  I'm not nervous.
[01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:04.530]  I'm not paranoid.
[01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:06.790]  I'm just waiting for you and I can track you.
[01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:07.270]  So it's fine.
[01:04:07.650 --> 01:04:08.550]  You can't track me.
[01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:09.690]  What are you talking about?
[01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:11.590]  Thanks for listening.
[01:04:11.590 --> 01:04:12.390]  And that's the end.
[01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:16.650]  I'm going to leave without any of my stuff.
[01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:17.870]  I'm not going to take my phone.
[01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:21.150]  I'm going to leave through the back door.
[01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:23.230]  You can't.
[01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:24.120]  You won't.
[01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:27.270]  I think he probably will.
[01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:29.430]  Love you guys.
[01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:30.690]  Bye audience.
[01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.810]  Bye.
[01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:32.710]  Great review.
[01:04:33.010 --> 01:04:33.890]  Stars and likes.
[01:04:34.050 --> 01:04:34.910]  Tell your friends.
[01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:36.090]  Eat cucumbers.
[01:04:36.730 --> 01:04:38.310]  Stay away from double salt licorice.
[01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:40.230]  Have a happy 2023.
[01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:42.890]  I guess it's already 2023 to you.
[01:04:43.210 --> 01:04:44.630]  Yeah, it's the middle of the month.
[01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:47.110]  I hope it's off to a great start.
[01:04:47.110 --> 01:04:50.310]  This is Geoff signing off from the past.
[01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:52.070]  Where am I now?
[01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:53.990]  Still in Austin.
[01:04:54.330 --> 01:04:55.150]  In a state of denial.
[01:04:57.910 --> 01:05:02.310]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:04.610]  Let's look at Andrew's arts and crafts.
[01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:06.090]  It's time for another bet.
[01:05:06.450 --> 01:05:08.030]  Who was the sneaky person?
[01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:09.870]  The gang turns on each other.
[01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:11.650]  Did we win an award after all?
[01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:13.610]  Let's rock a full face mask.
[01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:16.430]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:19.470]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
