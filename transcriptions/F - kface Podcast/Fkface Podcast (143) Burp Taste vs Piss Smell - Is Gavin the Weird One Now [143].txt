[00:15.370 --> 00:21.770]  Right before I came, like right as I was coming into the Discord for Pleasantries, I had to burp.
[00:22.210 --> 00:28.530]  But I like, I like tried to burp, but I was like doing other stuff at the same time, so I wasn't paying full burp attention.
[00:28.830 --> 00:32.870]  And I accidentally kind of swallowed the burp. You know, sometimes you do.
[00:34.190 --> 00:39.010]  And it's made me so sad. I don't know why.
[00:39.010 --> 00:42.990]  I just started to feel really bummed out and sad the second I swallowed my burp.
[00:43.070 --> 00:45.590]  And I can feel it in there and I want it to go away, but it won't.
[00:45.930 --> 00:49.350]  And now I just have this like phantom burp that won't leave me alone.
[00:49.670 --> 00:50.530]  Can you taste it?
[00:51.070 --> 00:53.630]  Yeah, yeah. It tastes like schlotzkies.
[00:56.230 --> 00:57.410]  So I had schlotzkies.
[00:57.930 --> 00:58.450]  Oh boy.
[00:59.170 --> 01:01.650]  Well, Gavin's here. There's the episode number. Go crazy.
[01:02.790 --> 01:03.590]  Episode 143?
[01:04.330 --> 01:05.570]  Yeah, it's 143.
[01:05.910 --> 01:06.990]  I gotta get these burps out.
[01:07.670 --> 01:10.330]  Actually, I'm going to write down a note right now for this episode.
[01:10.570 --> 01:11.210]  It's fucking depressing.
[01:11.550 --> 01:12.070]  What's that?
[01:12.970 --> 01:18.170]  I need to find a clip of it. I don't know what it is. I've been racking my brain for days.
[01:18.450 --> 01:23.290]  I watched the does it do's that have been finished that are to release at some point.
[01:23.530 --> 01:23.990]  What'd you think?
[01:24.710 --> 01:30.470]  I loved them. I had so much fun. I genuinely made my night. I was laughing so hard. You guys did such an amazing job with it.
[01:30.470 --> 01:43.310]  There's a point in which Geoff tries to eat something. And it is the most visceral, physical reaction I've seen outside of a boxing or cage.
[01:44.410 --> 01:54.270]  You genuinely look like you got wobbled. You moved exactly like somebody who was about to drop from being knocked out due to getting hit in the head.
[01:54.270 --> 02:01.870]  And I don't know what fight it is or who it is, but I know it's the same thing.
[02:02.170 --> 02:07.750]  So I've been in my head trying to go through fights, figuring out what wobble you essentially copied.
[02:08.130 --> 02:13.030]  And you're just displeasure of experiencing one of the things that you had to consume.
[02:13.330 --> 02:14.750]  Eric doesn't know if this is the episode.
[02:15.370 --> 02:15.990]  I think it's the episode.
[02:16.510 --> 02:16.770]  Yeah.
[02:16.910 --> 02:17.370]  Am I recording?
[02:18.210 --> 02:19.230]  Yeah, I'm recording. It's the episode.
[02:19.230 --> 02:29.130]  It is episode 143. Welcome to F*** Face, a podcast that is hosted by Geoff Ramsey, Gavin Freem, myself, Eric sometimes comes in.
[02:29.410 --> 02:31.430]  You may be hearing Nick laugh. I'm not sure.
[02:32.170 --> 02:33.850]  I think we're hearing Nick laugh now, right?
[02:33.870 --> 02:35.730]  Yeah, this is the first one where Nick's not on mute.
[02:37.610 --> 02:40.590]  Why didn't you laugh during that, Nick? That wasn't funny enough for you?
[02:43.510 --> 02:48.750]  It's just going to be anxiety and calling out Nick for not laughing or laughing too hard.
[02:50.050 --> 02:54.850]  Was that a better intro? I had to do the intro last episode? Two episodes ago?
[02:55.090 --> 02:57.950]  And it was not good, because I did not plan it.
[02:58.190 --> 03:03.090]  Before we started, we were doing pleasantries. Geoff, you weren't here yet. I think I mentioned it in the episode.
[03:03.250 --> 03:04.930]  But Eric had a different recording set up.
[03:05.350 --> 03:06.910]  And he said, do not throw to me.
[03:07.430 --> 03:10.790]  Like, just whatever you do, don't throw to me. I want to talk as little as possible.
[03:11.270 --> 03:13.730]  And he didn't want to say it while you were there.
[03:13.730 --> 03:18.870]  Because if you knew that, you would throw to Eric as much as you possibly could within the episode.
[03:19.430 --> 03:22.890]  What? Oh, come on. That's absolutely you.
[03:23.230 --> 03:29.030]  I don't know how you're so fucking incredulous about it. There's no way you would not have done that.
[03:29.210 --> 03:34.210]  All you would have done is gone. You would have just gone, what do you think about that, Eric? Over and over.
[03:34.390 --> 03:36.490]  And I was on a laptop with, like, no microphone.
[03:36.910 --> 03:38.830]  I don't know that that's true at all.
[03:39.230 --> 03:39.590]  I do.
[03:39.650 --> 03:40.910]  Anyway, you were saying, Andrew?
[03:41.710 --> 03:47.510]  I was saying just that that was the instructions given to not let you know.
[03:47.650 --> 03:52.550]  And as soon as the show started, you're like, well, it's the intro time. Eric does our intros. Eric, take it away.
[03:52.690 --> 03:55.790]  And I went into panic. I was not anticipating that.
[03:55.950 --> 04:01.910]  And you can tell. We just go, oh, no, I'll do it. Oh, this is the show that Geoff does.
[04:03.010 --> 04:06.670]  And then this is Geoff. Like, I think I intro'd you twice.
[04:07.310 --> 04:11.450]  And there's one other point, like, in the middle where you're like, I want to hear what Eric has to say.
[04:11.550 --> 04:14.290]  And I just say, nope, we're not doing that. We're moving on.
[04:14.510 --> 04:14.910]  You just kept taking bullets.
[04:16.870 --> 04:20.230]  It seemed so rude. Like, I was like, fuck you, Eric, you're not speaking.
[04:20.530 --> 04:24.410]  But there's no context for the direction given.
[04:25.610 --> 04:29.770]  But I think that was a better intro. That was a step up. I was a little bit more prepared for that one.
[04:29.790 --> 04:30.290]  You nailed it.
[04:30.610 --> 04:31.570]  I thought it was awesome, dude.
[04:31.570 --> 04:31.610]  Thank you.
[04:31.930 --> 04:32.310]  That's great.
[04:32.310 --> 04:37.270]  Yeah, and you really covered for... I was dealing with some internal sadness because of a burp situation.
[04:37.690 --> 04:41.750]  And so you covered for me until I was able to get that sorted out, which I really appreciate.
[04:42.070 --> 04:46.930]  So, you're really into figuring out your own smells. You're not into figuring out burp tastes.
[04:47.550 --> 04:51.510]  No, I am. It tasted like Schlotzky's. I know exactly what it tasted like. I just had it.
[04:52.070 --> 05:00.030]  But, like, the range of burp flavor is something you would not want to explore in the same way that you seem to have an interest in diving deep in the piss.
[05:00.030 --> 05:06.350]  Well, I don't... I just think it's... I mean, a burp is gonna smell like what you put in your mouth.
[05:06.470 --> 05:13.090]  It's weird to me that something that comes out of your dick will smell differently because of something you put in your mouth.
[05:13.570 --> 05:15.310]  You know, I just think it's more interesting.
[05:15.670 --> 05:21.170]  Well, it bounces back, though, from, like, it goes in your stomach and then back up where it came.
[05:21.170 --> 05:30.170]  I almost feel like that strength... like a bouncy ball, as opposed to goes in one hole, does a straight shot down and out a lower hole.
[05:30.350 --> 05:34.190]  That makes more sense to me. The bounce back is crazy, in my opinion.
[05:36.170 --> 05:39.410]  Gavin, what do you feel? Where do you weigh in on this?
[05:40.350 --> 05:45.250]  Uh, I feel like stuff that comes out your butt is more interesting. I feel like there's more...
[05:45.250 --> 05:45.630]  Oh.
[05:46.230 --> 05:47.170]  I feel like...
[05:47.170 --> 05:47.950]  That is a deeper...
[05:47.950 --> 05:48.970]  He's more of a butt guy.
[05:48.970 --> 05:55.890]  Yeah, because it's not coming back up through the same pipes. It's more of a conversion.
[05:56.750 --> 06:00.390]  Can I counter that? Can I explain to you why the butt is the least interesting?
[06:00.670 --> 06:07.350]  Because everything you put in your mouth comes out of your butt, for the most part, right? Is there an exception?
[06:07.670 --> 06:08.430]  Well, except for the piss.
[06:09.310 --> 06:16.190]  Yeah, but the piss is water, right? That came in through the mouth hole. It was consumed.
[06:16.710 --> 06:22.230]  Things that come out of your butt are like the past. They're what's behind you. Like, literally and figuratively.
[06:22.410 --> 06:33.290]  You ate it yesterday. It comes out of you. Your body is so disinterested in the butt that it shoots it out behind you so that you can keep walking forward and not even look over your shoulder.
[06:33.650 --> 06:40.570]  Whereas pee and burps come, like, you're confronted with them because they are the present and the immediate future in front of you.
[06:40.570 --> 06:52.210]  A burp is almost never a surprise. It's like, oh yeah, mackerel. A piss is only ever piss, coffee, or asparagus, none of which are a surprise because it's like, oh yeah.
[06:52.510 --> 06:55.970]  But sometimes there's a fart that pops out where it's like, what on earth?
[06:56.630 --> 06:58.190]  Have you ever had a surprise burp?
[06:58.410 --> 07:00.970]  I have had as many surprise burps as surprise farts in my life.
[07:00.990 --> 07:02.510]  I never forecast my burps.
[07:02.910 --> 07:05.970]  But you couldn't identify the meal that the burp has come from?
[07:06.610 --> 07:14.410]  Well, it depends. I think generally I could, but when I eat something, I never assume it's going to come back as air in the same hole.
[07:14.570 --> 07:18.070]  It's going to bounce back up through. That's not an expectation I have.
[07:18.470 --> 07:21.130]  I do assume I'm going to shit this out when I do consume it.
[07:23.170 --> 07:25.270]  That's an inevitability we can't avoid.
[07:25.730 --> 07:27.790]  But the burp is not, like, that's a bonus.
[07:29.310 --> 07:30.370]  It's like a surprise thing.
[07:30.370 --> 07:37.970]  It's like when you do a scratch and win and you get the little space at the bottom that's typically like, try again, but sometimes you get $5 on it.
[07:38.230 --> 07:39.030]  That's what that is.
[07:39.490 --> 07:43.210]  I never assume the burp is going to come back with the flavor, but it does happen sometimes.
[07:43.610 --> 07:45.610]  And I think it's very unpredictable when it does.
[07:46.770 --> 07:55.410]  Do you know how sometimes you'll see on TikTok or Instagram or YouTube security cam footage of a grocery store?
[07:55.650 --> 07:57.190]  Like black and white kind of grainy footage.
[07:57.190 --> 08:03.370]  And some lady or sometimes a dude, but I find it's a lady more often than a dude, will just be like walking down an aisle.
[08:03.610 --> 08:10.270]  And then she'll just like squat down and just like pop out to like pull her pants down, pop out two logs, pull her pants back up and keep walking.
[08:10.610 --> 08:13.670]  Like it didn't even phase her or him.
[08:13.990 --> 08:16.150]  I hate to say, I know exactly what you're talking about.
[08:16.290 --> 08:21.230]  I see those videos all the time where it's just like this crazy person just took a shit in a grocery store and kept walking.
[08:22.090 --> 08:23.670]  Do you think you could ever do that?
[08:23.670 --> 08:27.850]  I don't know how somebody can shit and move in such a fluid motion.
[08:28.290 --> 08:29.490]  Like it's an event for me.
[08:29.590 --> 08:34.370]  First off, I haven't taken a solid dump in like eight years because of the Miralax and the diverticulitis.
[08:34.690 --> 08:37.370]  So it would look like a Jackson Pollock painting in the grocery store.
[08:37.670 --> 08:45.870]  But like, do you think you could do just not even break stride and just like shit and move in 15 seconds and just be about your business like nothing ever happened?
[08:46.090 --> 08:46.710]  I don't think I could.
[08:46.770 --> 08:50.530]  I always wondered what it would be like to take a shit at full sprint and whether it could even be done.
[08:50.530 --> 08:51.830]  Oh, God.
[08:52.570 --> 08:55.930]  I just don't. I don't see myself. I think it's more of a mental block for me.
[08:56.250 --> 08:57.670]  Yeah, it just feels uncomfortable.
[08:58.050 --> 09:04.450]  So we need to create like the first ever diarrhea run where we all try to kill ourselves.
[09:04.530 --> 09:08.190]  Well, I don't think it'll be the first ever. I don't think anything with butt or shit will be the first anything.
[09:08.570 --> 09:17.910]  You think anybody's ever had like a race where everybody has numbers on their chest and they stand up in a line and then somebody shoots a pistol and they all run with diarrhea buttholes?
[09:19.970 --> 09:21.390]  What is this episode?
[09:21.810 --> 09:29.790]  No, I have an idea. What if it was a long jump, but they measure where the shit flies out? So like you have to try to launch it while jumping.
[09:30.190 --> 09:33.310]  Are you saying like the shit would give you a little extra boost?
[09:33.750 --> 09:41.830]  No, no, no. Like you gotta like when you jump, you know how typically you're trying to extend for where your feet land and this one you're trying to propel the shit midair.
[09:41.910 --> 09:45.770]  Like you're trying to do like a roll or like a twist, like a hip flex.
[09:45.770 --> 09:49.890]  So you'd want to spin over forwards or backwards and fire one out beyond your jump.
[09:50.390 --> 09:59.070]  Exactly. That's exactly right. Like a long shit jump. As opposed to a diarrhea run, which I feel like that's tougher to measure.
[09:59.190 --> 10:00.850]  Well, the Olympics isn't supposed to be easy.
[10:01.390 --> 10:04.590]  That's true. That's a good point. These are trained season athletes.
[10:05.050 --> 10:07.830]  Is this in our Olympics along with Frisbee and Cornhole?
[10:07.990 --> 10:15.350]  I don't think so. I don't think so at all. I do have a new sport for us to enter into the Olympics that I think you guys are going to love.
[10:15.350 --> 10:19.570]  That we can get to at some point. Eric and I came up with the other day.
[10:19.990 --> 10:22.410]  Really? I feel like this has been an interesting week.
[10:22.630 --> 10:28.510]  I have spent so much time with all of you like outside of regulation time spending.
[10:28.870 --> 10:31.930]  Like I spent half a day with Eric at a baseball field this week.
[10:32.050 --> 10:35.790]  I played video games with Gavin, but not Andrew, all night last night.
[10:35.950 --> 10:39.370]  I filmed a secret podcast with Andrew this morning.
[10:39.790 --> 10:41.510]  Nick is the only one I haven't hung out with this week.
[10:41.730 --> 10:44.170]  It was as shocking to me as it was you, Gavin.
[10:46.510 --> 10:48.510]  Geoff texted me this morning about a thing.
[10:49.050 --> 10:52.410]  And he said it would take 45 minutes or something.
[10:52.530 --> 10:54.570]  And it would have been half that, but he said 45 minutes.
[10:54.870 --> 11:00.730]  So in my head I was like, okay, so we're recording at 12.30, so that's like 11.50-ish for me.
[11:00.770 --> 11:04.290]  And he's like, cool, I'm just going to go home and take a dump and then we can record.
[11:04.630 --> 11:07.010]  And I was like, what are we doing? What are you talking about?
[11:07.690 --> 11:11.450]  I had an idea at a coffee shop and I immediately left the coffee shop to go record it with Andrew.
[11:12.210 --> 11:14.450]  You immediately left to take a shit and then you recorded it.
[11:14.450 --> 11:18.550]  Well, yeah, the shit presented itself on the drive home.
[11:19.570 --> 11:21.170]  The shit wasn't a part of the idea.
[11:22.950 --> 11:24.810]  I hadn't had that inspiration yet.
[11:24.950 --> 11:27.670]  Boy, do we have some supplemental content for you.
[11:28.110 --> 11:33.110]  I do not think you're going to want to watch the YouTube release of Geoff's new show.
[11:34.770 --> 11:35.490]  Coffee Shits.
[11:36.370 --> 11:40.450]  But the point is, I've had some really fun, interesting times with all of you guys this week.
[11:40.510 --> 11:41.850]  I really appreciated the extra time.
[11:41.910 --> 11:43.770]  And then Gavin, you and I are going to hang out tonight after work.
[11:43.770 --> 11:45.370]  We've got, yeah, we've got time to come.
[11:45.750 --> 11:46.210]  Yeah, we do.
[11:46.730 --> 11:47.570]  You have time to come?
[11:47.970 --> 11:51.910]  How much time is needed to come, Gavin?
[11:53.510 --> 11:54.310]  That's unfortunate.
[11:56.110 --> 11:57.690]  That's a real misstep by you.
[11:57.950 --> 12:02.250]  Gavin, our friendship is so not awkward. We're hanging out two days in a row.
[12:02.350 --> 12:03.410]  I know. It's great.
[12:03.750 --> 12:04.890]  That's fucking pretty regulation.
[12:04.890 --> 12:06.510]  Oh, Eric says, is that why it's so cold today?
[12:06.710 --> 12:11.370]  Yeah, I think it's because of our plans. It was 28 degrees yesterday and today it's like 12.
[12:11.370 --> 12:13.490]  It's fucking dog shit today.
[12:13.630 --> 12:17.450]  I went for a bike ride in t-shirt and shorts yesterday and was still hot.
[12:18.730 --> 12:20.130]  Today it's fucking 40 degrees outside.
[12:21.470 --> 12:22.730]  I have a shit story.
[12:22.950 --> 12:24.230]  Please, tell us your shit story.
[12:24.450 --> 12:27.610]  Yeah, so I, Gavin got part of this already.
[12:27.930 --> 12:32.670]  Oh, can I, should I read out what you said before ending the conversation immediately?
[12:32.950 --> 12:33.270]  Go ahead.
[12:33.970 --> 12:37.150]  Dude, I'm in such a risky scenario right now.
[12:37.290 --> 12:39.050]  I replied, what scenario?
[12:39.630 --> 12:42.850]  Andrew said, it's like I'm trying to shit on an ice rink.
[12:42.930 --> 12:45.050]  And then followed up with, ignore this.
[12:46.010 --> 12:47.530]  It is now for the podcast.
[12:48.070 --> 12:50.110]  And I replied, four ha's.
[12:51.630 --> 12:54.990]  I didn't anticipate this being a podcast story, but I was, I woke up.
[12:55.810 --> 12:57.470]  I was doing stuff on my phone.
[12:57.750 --> 12:59.550]  As one does, I'm groggy.
[12:59.830 --> 13:02.370]  I didn't realize I had to take a shit.
[13:02.570 --> 13:04.030]  But then I, I had to.
[13:04.030 --> 13:09.770]  And it was like, you know, when you're trying to like pass through a pebble and you just can't get it out.
[13:09.850 --> 13:12.470]  But like, it's, it comes out like 30% of the way.
[13:12.810 --> 13:15.210]  And you just can't, like being constipated almost.
[13:15.230 --> 13:18.710]  But it's like, you're trying to get this out, but it just won't.
[13:18.970 --> 13:23.610]  Is it like one of the ones where you have to give your asshole a little breather and potentially cut off midway?
[13:23.670 --> 13:25.350]  Yeah, but you, you don't want to stop.
[13:25.370 --> 13:27.850]  Almost like you're in a 127 hour scenario.
[13:27.850 --> 13:30.350]  Like you don't want to lose whatever momentum you have.
[13:30.430 --> 13:31.950]  Yeah, you don't want to make the snip.
[13:32.410 --> 13:35.410]  Yeah, so it's, that's, I'm struggling with that.
[13:35.550 --> 13:37.030]  But before that even happens.
[13:37.510 --> 13:38.610]  So I sit on the toilet.
[13:38.930 --> 13:40.450]  And I've had this issue in the past.
[13:40.610 --> 13:44.750]  These are the shittiest, I mean no, that's a bad choice of words considering the story.
[13:45.010 --> 13:46.450]  But these are terrible toilet seats.
[13:46.770 --> 13:47.470]  I'd snapped.
[13:48.010 --> 13:48.910]  That's what happened before.
[13:48.970 --> 13:49.910]  I think I talked about it in the past.
[13:49.990 --> 13:53.030]  I had a broken toilet seat that I was using because it was only half broken.
[13:53.410 --> 13:54.290]  I broke the clip.
[13:54.610 --> 13:58.970]  What'll happen sometimes is I'll sit, I'll sit down and I'll go a little high.
[13:59.090 --> 14:01.610]  And then I'll go to adjust my body, but I don't lift up.
[14:01.610 --> 14:02.770]  I just like slide.
[14:03.150 --> 14:04.330]  And it'll pop off.
[14:04.450 --> 14:05.390]  And it broke one.
[14:05.930 --> 14:06.770]  So I broke.
[14:07.070 --> 14:07.810]  It went BAH!
[14:07.950 --> 14:09.010]  Like it did a lot of pop.
[14:09.330 --> 14:11.270]  I thought, God damn it, I broke.
[14:11.530 --> 14:12.950]  This is fucking broken.
[14:13.270 --> 14:14.110]  I'm an idiot.
[14:14.550 --> 14:16.650]  Next time I'm going to order two of these.
[14:16.830 --> 14:19.590]  This is, I'm so mad, but at least, hey, I only have to piss.
[14:19.670 --> 14:19.990]  This is fine.
[14:20.390 --> 14:21.090]  We're good.
[14:21.610 --> 14:24.290]  Then, then the shit thing happened.
[14:24.810 --> 14:27.650]  And I'm trying to clench and my seat is broken.
[14:27.870 --> 14:29.830]  And I'm wobbling all over the toilet.
[14:29.830 --> 14:31.470]  I'm just like going all over the place.
[14:31.570 --> 14:38.050]  I'm trying to get like generate force to push, but I can't because the seat is sliding all over.
[14:38.330 --> 14:40.090]  It was like doing a grind in Tony Hawk.
[14:41.470 --> 14:44.590]  Like I was just going from corner to corner and it was broken.
[14:44.730 --> 14:45.910]  I couldn't do anything about it.
[14:46.210 --> 14:47.830]  And I'm doing stuff on my phone.
[14:47.930 --> 14:50.510]  So I can't like I'm losing a balance point that way.
[14:50.570 --> 14:51.570]  That's when I texted.
[14:51.730 --> 14:57.130]  I'm on an ice rink because I was, I was like skating around my toilet trying to fix this.
[14:57.130 --> 15:01.590]  Surely then you're at risk of your cock and balls slamming into the inner rim of the seat.
[15:01.870 --> 15:03.810]  There's all sorts of risks going on.
[15:03.890 --> 15:05.730]  And this is the start to my day.
[15:05.830 --> 15:06.590]  This is how we're going.
[15:06.690 --> 15:07.530]  This is the beginning.
[15:07.650 --> 15:08.770]  We're just getting things rolling.
[15:08.990 --> 15:09.970]  So you still got the grog?
[15:10.670 --> 15:11.930]  I still am groggy.
[15:12.050 --> 15:14.490]  I'm still putting things together and I'm skating.
[15:15.030 --> 15:23.330]  I thought I was just going to have a nice relaxed start, but no, I'm trying to shit up this pebble while my seat is going all over the place.
[15:23.330 --> 15:26.930]  I eventually, after like five minutes, give up.
[15:27.110 --> 15:28.450]  I realized I didn't break it.
[15:28.510 --> 15:29.550]  It just like popped off.
[15:29.610 --> 15:31.250]  It's like a snap on, snap off.
[15:31.270 --> 15:32.430]  So I just re-secured it.
[15:32.490 --> 15:33.230]  We're good to go.
[15:33.510 --> 15:38.130]  But I spent like five minutes trying to balance and like going from side to side.
[15:38.150 --> 15:39.590]  It was the worst shit I've ever had.
[15:39.750 --> 15:44.430]  Have you ever seen a 3D printer like mess up the print mid-print and it just starts doing H-shapes?
[15:45.370 --> 15:46.670]  Yeah, that's what it was.
[15:46.750 --> 15:48.090]  Like spewing out spaghetti.
[15:48.270 --> 15:49.530]  It's like freaking out.
[15:50.290 --> 15:53.930]  I have never wanted shitting shades more in my life.
[15:53.990 --> 15:58.230]  Like I feel like I would have at least felt cool during the experience.
[15:58.830 --> 16:01.910]  Like I was, I've never been more on board with that idea, Geoff, than in that moment.
[16:02.470 --> 16:06.330]  I have a bathroom story as well I'd like to share if you wouldn't mind.
[16:06.390 --> 16:08.630]  Yes, let's just load up on them right now.
[16:09.250 --> 16:11.810]  Yesterday morning, was it yesterday or the day before?
[16:11.930 --> 16:15.570]  I don't know, who can remember the fucking, I'm so old, the days they just run together now.
[16:16.210 --> 16:21.910]  At some point this week, I woke up at about four in the morning and I was in pain.
[16:22.750 --> 16:25.490]  And I was in pain for a reason that we can talk about if you'd like.
[16:25.930 --> 16:33.610]  I made an error in a previous podcast when I declared certain eras of my life over.
[16:34.050 --> 16:37.550]  And how I was unhappy to be in certain new eras.
[16:37.710 --> 16:39.730]  Well, old eras didn't like that.
[16:39.950 --> 16:42.630]  And so they enacted a revenge on me over the weekend.
[16:42.630 --> 16:45.390]  So anyway, I'll tell the bathroom story first.
[16:45.650 --> 16:49.570]  So I get up at like four in the morning in some pain and I also have to piss.
[16:50.090 --> 16:58.550]  And so I go into my bathroom, my pee room, and above the toilet is the cabinet where I have medicine and shit.
[16:58.950 --> 17:05.790]  And so I got the lights off because it's fucking four in the morning but I can see from the glow of the bidet.
[17:06.010 --> 17:08.910]  It's got a gentle blue glow so you can kind of see in the dark.
[17:09.650 --> 17:14.170]  And it's more than enough to do my business without turning lights on and blinding myself.
[17:16.170 --> 17:25.130]  So I start to pee and while I'm peeing and kind of swaying and half asleep, I put my hand up on the cabinet to kind of steady myself.
[17:25.270 --> 17:27.150]  And then I'm like, all right, I gotta get the medicine out.
[17:27.170 --> 17:31.410]  And I grabbed the door handle, which is just like a little crystal knob.
[17:31.690 --> 17:35.870]  And I grabbed the door handle to open the door to get out a leave.
[17:37.330 --> 17:44.030]  And it pops off in my hand and I'm asleep and it's a little slippery for some reason.
[17:44.450 --> 17:51.630]  And it just falls through my hand, through my piss stream and into the bottom of my toilet while I'm still pissing in my toilet.
[17:51.830 --> 17:52.590]  Oh no.
[17:52.670 --> 18:01.350]  And so I'm just looking. I got a cabinet with no handle now and I've just got a handle in the toilet and I'm peeing on it.
[18:01.530 --> 18:03.210]  And so I'm like, what the fuck do I do?
[18:03.790 --> 18:06.850]  And I'm fucking exhausted and in pain and tired.
[18:07.210 --> 18:10.030]  And so I finished peeing and I'm like, I'm not dealing with this right now.
[18:10.110 --> 18:11.050]  I'm just going to go back to bed.
[18:11.170 --> 18:17.230]  And then as I'm like turning around to go back to bed, I'm thinking, no, because Emily will get up to go to the bathroom and then she'll flush the toilet.
[18:17.710 --> 18:19.670]  And then this thing will fucking get stuck in the pipe.
[18:19.710 --> 18:24.810]  And then it's going to cost me $400,000 and they'll have to rebuild my house for some reason.
[18:25.130 --> 18:26.530]  And my roof will fall in.
[18:26.730 --> 18:28.350]  And so I was like, I got to deal with it right now.
[18:28.350 --> 18:29.770]  So I have to fucking turn.
[18:29.910 --> 18:34.510]  I feel like first I have to shut the bathroom doors so that there's no light pollution for Emily because she's asleep and it's right next to her.
[18:34.710 --> 18:36.190]  And then I have to turn on all the lights.
[18:36.310 --> 18:42.330]  So now it's like fucking two in the afternoon in Texas and I live in my bathroom and I have to like I'm looking around.
[18:42.930 --> 18:58.270]  And all I can think of to do is just I just have to shove my hand into my pissy toilet and then grab this this fucking handle covered in pee and then shake the pee off my hand and walk over to my sink and wash my hand and wash my bathroom.
[18:58.270 --> 19:02.530]  Cabinet handle and all that and then put it all back together and then go back to sleep.
[19:02.870 --> 19:04.470]  It took me about 20 minutes.
[19:05.790 --> 19:07.510]  Glove? Like just a glove?
[19:08.030 --> 19:10.430]  Nah, I wasn't thinking about gloves at four in the morning.
[19:10.470 --> 19:11.030]  From the dishes?
[19:11.650 --> 19:13.010]  I was just asleep, man.
[19:13.150 --> 19:13.770]  Couple of wooden spoons?
[19:13.770 --> 19:18.370]  What about like a plastic... did I ever talk about when I tried to declog my toilet with a spoon?
[19:18.370 --> 19:22.550]  Yeah, I could have got tongs. I'd rather get my hand pissy than my tongs I use for my barbecue.
[19:23.090 --> 19:25.650]  Throw the tongs away and buy you tongs!
[19:25.670 --> 19:27.130]  I'll just throw my hand away!
[19:27.130 --> 19:36.730]  Why are you... I don't understand. Here's the thing. You saving it just so it doesn't go in the toilet is fine. You putting it back on the fucking cabinet is crazy.
[19:36.930 --> 19:39.770]  Well, I cleaned it and washed it and put it back on.
[19:39.930 --> 19:40.430]  Gavin, thoughts?
[19:41.150 --> 19:43.270]  Well, I mean, if...
[19:45.050 --> 19:47.910]  You can clean tongs if you can clean cabinet handles.
[19:48.550 --> 19:49.010]  That's true.
[19:49.410 --> 19:51.850]  I would never view those tongs in the same way, though.
[19:52.730 --> 19:55.370]  I wouldn't want to open the cabinet in the same way.
[19:55.370 --> 20:02.470]  It's not gonna have pee on it forever. Soap cleans dirty stuff. It's fine now.
[20:02.530 --> 20:02.850]  Like tongs.
[20:03.290 --> 20:20.410]  Yeah, that's why I wasn't there at four in the morning with my middle faculties. I also wasn't looking to open up fucking rooms and bouncing, like, stomp through the house trying to find fucking kitchen tongs to explain to Emily that I've got kitchen tongs in my hand and I'm digging a fucking crystal knob out of the toilet. There's no way, dude.
[20:20.550 --> 20:21.870]  I think I know what I would have done.
[20:22.330 --> 20:22.790]  What's that?
[20:22.790 --> 20:25.650]  I think I would have gone in... I would have done a foot job.
[20:27.050 --> 20:28.050]  That's way worse.
[20:28.390 --> 20:30.770]  Because it wouldn't work! It wouldn't work!
[20:31.250 --> 20:33.030]  Just between the old toes.
[20:33.810 --> 20:43.870]  What episode is this? Is this 142? This is the one where Gavin becomes a weird guy. He's talking about coming on time and now he's a foot guy. Like, just a weird dude.
[20:44.130 --> 20:48.250]  Yeah, 143 might be the one where Gavin really, like, comes into his own here.
[20:50.630 --> 20:53.310]  Look, you stick a foot in and you just kick it out.
[20:53.830 --> 21:00.010]  I'd like to reframe this for you, Gavin. I think you might have a shift of opinion on this whole cleaning of the tongs thing. I'm kind of with Geoff on this.
[21:00.250 --> 21:15.970]  If you were at Geoff's house, right, and he's doing up a meal, and then you're getting something, you're using the tongs to grab something, like, some food, and he was like, oh yeah, those tongs were in my toilet once when I pissed in it, how would you feel about it, regardless of how it was cleaned?
[21:17.050 --> 21:19.090]  You're not going to enjoy that. It would ruin the meal.
[21:19.290 --> 21:21.870]  You can disinfect stuff. You can fill it with stuff.
[21:23.490 --> 21:36.150]  Gavin, it's four in the morning, you put your hand in a pissy toilet, you take your hand out, you walk to the sink, you clean it off. It's four in the morning, you put your foot in a pissy toilet. How do you clean that off?
[21:36.150 --> 21:49.710]  You hop across the whole bathroom, slinging piss foot, and then take a shower, is what you gotta do. That's the worst thing you could do in that situation, is stick your foot in a pissy toilet. That is the single worst thing you could do.
[21:49.850 --> 22:00.010]  The weirdest part about this whole thing, to me, is that Geoff is very concerned about staying, like, half asleep while all of this happens.
[22:00.010 --> 22:10.490]  Once you wake up, you're awake, you're fucked, you can't go back to sleep. I don't want to lose three hours of sleep because of one fucking dumb moment.
[22:10.670 --> 22:13.350]  I feel like as soon as skin touches piss, you're awake.
[22:13.730 --> 22:15.710]  Yes, 100% agree.
[22:16.450 --> 22:23.150]  I'm thinking, just using the foot, fling it out like a goat would kick something. Just fling it.
[22:23.990 --> 22:31.230]  Now you're flinging piss across the whole bathroom. You're a fucking animal. You're a psycho, dude. You're fucking wrong.
[22:31.230 --> 22:32.730]  I'm not talking about flinging.
[22:33.330 --> 22:37.370]  In your fiber, in the core of your being, there's something wrong.
[22:37.430 --> 22:44.850]  It's not a fling from within the liquid, it's like a foot goes in, you sort of clamp it against the bottom, you smear it up out of the water, and then fling.
[22:44.850 --> 22:47.550]  God, it's so much more gross what you're doing.
[22:47.750 --> 22:52.570]  It's on my foot, though. It's like a dirtier piece. I don't want my foot as clean as my hand.
[22:53.030 --> 22:55.290]  I'm not going to make a sandwich with my foot the next morning.
[22:55.590 --> 23:00.290]  Geoff, any time Gavin comes over, I'd make him wear three pairs of socks after this conversation.
[23:01.090 --> 23:04.150]  The way he views his feet, they're monstrosity.
[23:04.410 --> 23:08.190]  I'm weird about feet in that I assume they're already dirty.
[23:08.190 --> 23:13.750]  It's like some people really like touching their shoes, and they'll wear shoes on the couch, they'll put their hand on the bottom of their shoes.
[23:14.010 --> 23:16.870]  It's all disgusting and filth. It's horrible.
[23:17.330 --> 23:23.010]  That's why, if I'm going to use something to get dirty, I want it to be the thing that's already dirty, and I already treat dirty.
[23:23.670 --> 23:27.630]  This is as an aside, but I'm right there with you on the shoe thing.
[23:27.790 --> 23:34.850]  There's nothing that grosses me out more than when somebody's shoelaces are untied, and they're walking around stepping on them, and they're like, oh, I don't care.
[23:34.850 --> 23:38.050]  It's like, you better care, because that's piss on the ground.
[23:38.290 --> 23:41.330]  We already talked about it. Birds use this as a toilet.
[23:41.530 --> 23:46.030]  Everywhere you walk is dog piss and dog poop and animal piss and animal poop.
[23:46.230 --> 23:50.510]  And then you're stepping on it, and then you're tying your shoes with those laces with your fingers.
[23:50.690 --> 23:52.710]  I wear shoes without laces.
[23:53.430 --> 24:01.550]  And if I do happen to wear shoes with laces, and they come undone in public or anywhere near a restaurant or a bathroom, if I have to tie my shoes back up, I have to wash my hands.
[24:01.850 --> 24:02.250]  Absolutely.
[24:02.610 --> 24:02.890]  Straight after.
[24:04.150 --> 24:07.590]  Doesn't excuse everything you said about sticking a foot in a toilet, though.
[24:07.750 --> 24:07.990]  No.
[24:08.970 --> 24:12.270]  There's a precision you can use with your hands that you can't with your foot.
[24:15.910 --> 24:21.850]  If you have your hand covered in piss, you have your legs to walk you to a safe space to clean and decontaminate.
[24:22.110 --> 24:27.150]  If you put your foot in piss, you have to hobble or hop on one leg to get clean.
[24:27.250 --> 24:32.050]  Otherwise, leave a slug trail of piss with you where you go.
[24:32.050 --> 24:41.290]  The thing is, it all boils down to this, it's going to be less efficient, it's going to be messier, but at no point in my sleep am I going to put my foot in my mouth.
[24:41.550 --> 24:42.990]  You're going to put your hand in your mouth?
[24:43.250 --> 24:45.790]  My hand is right by my face. I might touch my face.
[24:46.130 --> 24:47.670]  You're a fucking weird guy.
[24:48.050 --> 24:49.890]  I'm glad that this is finally coming out.
[24:50.190 --> 24:51.250]  What are you talking about?
[24:51.530 --> 24:53.730]  You touch your face involuntarily.
[24:53.970 --> 24:56.010]  Now I'm imagining...
[24:56.010 --> 25:08.310]  If it's been knuckles into a toilet, and I'm at 4am, and I want to try not to wake up too much, I'm not going to be doing a good clean job on the old hands.
[25:08.430 --> 25:09.650]  I think it's safer there.
[25:09.970 --> 25:14.750]  No, but the way you're saying it, it's like you're going to fucking suck on your thumb in your sleep or something with your piss hand.
[25:14.910 --> 25:20.150]  It's going to be inside my mouth. I'm just going to be like a sniffle and I itch my nose or something in my sleep.
[25:20.670 --> 25:27.970]  If that hand is so dirty you don't want it near your face, how are you putting that foot on your own sheets?
[25:30.270 --> 25:31.850]  That is a fair trade, yeah.
[25:32.850 --> 25:37.210]  Like you'd have to wake up at 7am and immediately wash all of your sheets.
[25:37.690 --> 25:42.090]  Just wash your hands. I saved sleep. I was able to go back to bed. I did it right.
[25:42.470 --> 25:46.310]  I recovered two hours of sleep that I shouldn't have got.
[25:46.910 --> 25:48.010]  I'm happy with the results.
[25:48.010 --> 25:49.090]  I think you did it right.
[25:49.210 --> 25:53.770]  The more I talk about putting my foot in the bog, the more I feel like I'm on the wrong page.
[25:53.770 --> 25:57.230]  We just spent 20 minutes because you said it was wrong. What was the last 20 minutes?
[25:57.950 --> 26:01.970]  Look, I've come around. You guys have said a bunch of stuff and I'm starting to feel like that was a weird move.
[26:02.410 --> 26:03.610]  It was strange.
[26:03.830 --> 26:10.330]  I probably wouldn't have done it. I would have thought a lot. I would have probably been down to flipping a coin on whether my hand or my foot should go in.
[26:10.870 --> 26:16.390]  That's part of the problem though. You have to know in that moment when you're trying to save sleep that thought is your enemy.
[26:16.390 --> 26:22.750]  You have to act on instinct because the second you start to make decisions, your brain starts to wake up.
[26:22.970 --> 26:26.090]  So you got to kind of just let your body take you.
[26:26.430 --> 26:30.630]  You just kind of go where your body goes and try not to think too much while you're doing it.
[26:30.850 --> 26:32.470]  That's the only way to save your night's sleep.
[26:33.330 --> 26:34.970]  I probably would have just put on a glove.
[26:36.130 --> 26:38.470]  I think I probably would have grabbed a trash bag.
[26:39.270 --> 26:40.710]  I don't think I have gloves.
[26:40.930 --> 26:41.690]  That's a good idea too.
[26:42.150 --> 26:46.330]  I definitely don't have any gloves that I could have used.
[26:46.510 --> 26:47.390]  Oven mitts maybe?
[26:48.190 --> 26:52.530]  Yeah, I think at 4am I would have had one foot in the toilet wishing I just got a bag.
[26:52.770 --> 26:53.550]  That would be my situation.
[26:55.930 --> 26:57.330]  As I fumble around.
[26:58.510 --> 27:03.390]  I had to unclog a toilet once and I didn't have a snake so I broke a coat hanger.
[27:03.850 --> 27:07.670]  And I planned on using that. I wanted to keep my hand safe.
[27:07.670 --> 27:11.150]  And so the only thing I had was a big ziplock freezer bag.
[27:11.330 --> 27:13.130]  And so I put my hand in that.
[27:13.470 --> 27:16.670]  Then I held my makeshift toilet snake.
[27:17.090 --> 27:20.910]  And it broke while I was arm in the toilet.
[27:21.310 --> 27:24.490]  And the water got right to the lip of the ziplock.
[27:24.610 --> 27:25.910]  And then it didn't go down.
[27:26.270 --> 27:28.410]  It's the closest I've been to disaster.
[27:28.850 --> 27:30.510]  So it would have filled the bag with your hand.
[27:30.510 --> 27:35.430]  It would have filled immediately and just completely countered the entire purpose of the bag.
[27:35.430 --> 27:36.610]  And it worked.
[27:37.490 --> 27:40.030]  You get a trash bag instead.
[27:40.730 --> 27:42.630]  And just go whole arm with the trash bag.
[27:43.170 --> 27:44.130]  I think is the move.
[27:44.510 --> 27:45.690]  If you're in that scenario.
[27:46.070 --> 27:47.190]  Can we put this episode out?
[27:47.890 --> 27:48.270]  Absolutely.
[27:49.430 --> 27:51.710]  I mean you're the only weird one talking about coming on time.
[27:52.070 --> 27:53.990]  And rubbing your face with piss.
[27:54.270 --> 27:55.670]  Old piss foot free.
[27:57.190 --> 27:58.470]  Am I the new piss boy?
[27:58.730 --> 27:58.870]  No.
[28:00.710 --> 28:01.670]  That's definitely Andrew.
[28:02.170 --> 28:03.270]  No it's not.
[28:03.270 --> 28:05.950]  No you're the weird one.
[28:06.150 --> 28:07.030]  It's his nephew.
[28:07.830 --> 28:09.490]  We assigned the piss boy to the nephew.
[28:09.750 --> 28:11.190]  He would have peed on an entire plane.
[28:11.330 --> 28:12.810]  He's way more of a piss boy than me.
[28:16.350 --> 28:18.170]  I pass the reigns.
[28:23.760 --> 28:25.360]  Today's episode is sponsored by Honey.
[28:25.480 --> 28:28.380]  The easy way to save when shopping on your iPhone or computer.
[28:28.560 --> 28:29.520]  I love a good deal.
[28:29.640 --> 28:31.320]  There's nothing better than finding one.
[28:31.400 --> 28:32.120]  It's so excited.
[28:32.680 --> 28:33.500]  I'm so excited.
[28:33.500 --> 28:35.140]  Why did I say it's so excited?
[28:35.260 --> 28:37.820]  The deal isn't excited, I'm excited whenever I find one.
[28:38.220 --> 28:39.800]  And when it's a surprise it's even better.
[28:40.240 --> 28:44.000]  And thanks to Honey, manually searching for coupon codes is a thing of the past.

[28:57.660 --> 29:00.640]  Wait a few seconds as Honey searches for coupons it can find for that site.
[29:00.640 --> 29:04.620]  If Honey finds a working coupon, you'll watch the prices drop.
[29:05.020 --> 29:10.500]  I have saved money on clothing and tech stuff, food, I've saved all sorts of things using Honey.
[29:11.040 --> 29:14.880]  I was buying for myself, I didn't expect to save any money on some of those items.
[29:15.120 --> 29:20.160]  And then it was so easy to use, it popped up, I saved $15 on some equipment I was buying.
[29:20.960 --> 29:22.120]  It's great, I love Honey.
[29:22.560 --> 29:25.500]  And Honey doesn't just work on desktops, it works on your iPhone too.

[31:18.280 --> 31:23.140]  Have you watched House of Dragons and thought, hmm, what does a dragon smell like?

[32:04.240 --> 32:07.480]  and then I was introduced to it, and I enjoyed it a lot more than I'd expect.
[32:07.980 --> 32:10.300]  So I'd highly recommend you check it out.
[32:10.300 --> 32:14.540]  So go listen and subscribe to Tales from the Stinky Dragon wherever you get your podcasts.
[32:14.960 --> 32:15.660]  Thank you.
[32:18.160 --> 32:20.220]  So let me tell you about my luck.
[32:20.620 --> 32:20.940]  Alright.
[32:21.880 --> 32:29.320]  Alright, we've already covered the storm and the ice-pocalypse and how I had to live in a hotel,
[32:29.720 --> 32:34.260]  and then I had to live in an Airbnb, and then I had to rent another Airbnb, and then I got to move home,
[32:34.320 --> 32:36.440]  and then I couldn't get my money back for the Airbnb.
[32:36.440 --> 32:42.420]  And it was all kind of fucked up because I was leaving in two days to go back out of town anyway for Emily's birthday.
[32:42.480 --> 32:45.120]  Alright, did all that. Everything's fine.
[32:45.500 --> 32:50.720]  Move in to this little town in Lockhart, or a little town called Lockhart, just southeast of here.
[32:51.520 --> 32:54.640]  It's like a little old barbecue capital, but they have just these amazing houses.
[32:55.420 --> 32:58.300]  It's like 30 minutes outside of town, but it feels like worlds away,
[32:58.340 --> 33:02.240]  and there's these huge, like, sentry homes that are just absolutely gorgeous,
[33:02.440 --> 33:05.540]  and Emily loves this one particular one that we like to Airbnb,
[33:05.540 --> 33:08.080]  so we just went there for two days, had a big party.
[33:08.160 --> 33:10.380]  They have a heated pool. We invited a ton of people over.
[33:10.480 --> 33:11.600]  Gavin and Meg didn't come.
[33:12.100 --> 33:14.640]  Eric and Barbara, his lovely small wife, did come.
[33:14.760 --> 33:16.860]  Thank you for showing up, Eric. Appreciate that.
[33:17.560 --> 33:18.900]  Had a great time. Had a great day.
[33:21.160 --> 33:22.880]  Had a whole, like, two-day thing planned.
[33:23.280 --> 33:32.060]  The first night I get there, go to bed and thinking, like, finally I can relax.
[33:32.060 --> 33:36.720]  I went through this whole rigmarole with the house and power,
[33:37.300 --> 33:40.220]  and have slept in, like, nine different beds in the last week,
[33:40.260 --> 33:42.920]  and this isn't my bed, but I'm at least familiar with this place,
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.040]  and it's a comfortable, cozy, relaxing place.
[33:45.360 --> 33:47.640]  Finally, I can just fucking relax.
[33:48.500 --> 33:56.160]  Go to bed. Get awakened at about three in the morning by searing... tooth pain.
[33:57.160 --> 33:58.120]  Come on.
[33:58.120 --> 34:06.280]  First thought is, this is my fault for declaring that the dental era was over.
[34:07.500 --> 34:13.240]  Now, top left back tooth, second from the back tooth, is just throbbing
[34:13.240 --> 34:21.040]  in the exact same way that my tooth hurt a year ago when I had that surprise re-root canal, remember?
[34:21.360 --> 34:23.760]  Where you thought it was over, and then suddenly they're like,
[34:23.760 --> 34:27.060]  Ha-ha! Fuck you! Do it again! Right?
[34:28.540 --> 34:33.260]  So, I just, like, fucking... I don't sleep from that moment on,
[34:33.480 --> 34:37.180]  and then I have to get up and prepare for Emily's big day, right?
[34:37.380 --> 34:41.140]  And so, I'm like... and it's Saturday, so there's, like, nothing I can do.
[34:41.400 --> 34:44.460]  I even check at four or five in the morning. I even check.
[34:44.540 --> 34:46.820]  There's, like, there's no dentist open in Lockhart on a Saturday.
[34:47.060 --> 34:50.440]  I'm not driving an hour or 45 minutes to Austin on a Saturday,
[34:50.460 --> 34:52.060]  and also there's no dentist open on Saturday.
[34:52.060 --> 34:56.300]  This whole idea of, like, 24-hour dental cares, hospitals and shit is...
[34:56.300 --> 35:00.660]  It's all... it's all bullshit when you start to actually Google it and find out where those places are.
[35:00.740 --> 35:01.340]  They never exist.
[35:01.700 --> 35:05.320]  So, I'm like, I just have to fucking suffer through until Monday,
[35:05.960 --> 35:08.260]  and I guess I'm gonna have to get a fucking root canal.
[35:08.420 --> 35:12.220]  I don't know what else to do, and I don't want to ruin Emily's birthday,
[35:12.960 --> 35:15.080]  and so I'm just, like, try to grin and bear it,
[35:15.140 --> 35:18.760]  and I just take a bunch of Tylenol and stuff, and I just try to grin and bear it,
[35:18.820 --> 35:20.920]  and it gets a little better, and it subsides a little bit,
[35:20.920 --> 35:24.320]  but I basically had to spend that whole weekend of Emily's birthday celebrating her birthday,
[35:24.400 --> 35:27.000]  hanging out with Eric, and Trevor and Barbara were there,
[35:27.020 --> 35:28.580]  and a bunch of people were there having a good time,
[35:29.140 --> 35:34.820]  and I was just, like, trying to ignore the fact that I was in a tremendous amount of pain the entire time.
[35:34.860 --> 35:35.700]  I don't even think I talked about it.
[35:36.020 --> 35:36.980]  I tried not to talk about it, even.
[35:39.560 --> 35:41.320]  What did you say, Eric? You could tell I was hurting?
[35:42.120 --> 35:51.820]  You were a little, like, slow, and in this hoodie, and just sort of, like...
[35:51.820 --> 35:54.540]  Immediately, I just went, something's up with Geoff.
[35:54.900 --> 35:59.720]  Geoff is in physical pain, and trying his best to not be in physical pain.
[35:59.900 --> 36:00.740]  Did you ask about it?
[36:01.420 --> 36:02.500]  We talked about it.
[36:02.600 --> 36:04.520]  Because he just went, guess what?
[36:04.700 --> 36:06.320]  And it was like, no...
[36:06.880 --> 36:07.840]  It wasn't great.
[36:07.840 --> 36:11.360]  No, but it was like, he did a great job.
[36:11.580 --> 36:15.660]  I mean, like, participated, and was, like, the life of the party and everything,
[36:15.820 --> 36:18.120]  but the whole time, you're just going, like, he's dying.
[36:18.320 --> 36:19.380]  Like, he's hurting so bad.
[36:19.780 --> 36:20.860]  Well, thanks for saying that.
[36:20.920 --> 36:24.580]  I really did try to, like, try not to let it affect Emily's good time, you know,
[36:24.600 --> 36:25.540]  and her birthday weekend.
[36:27.220 --> 36:30.780]  And it got a little bit better on Sunday, and then I went to the doctor on Monday,
[36:31.300 --> 36:35.020]  and I explained to him that it was this root canal, and yada, yada, yada,
[36:35.460 --> 36:37.720]  and they went, yeah, you've never had a root canal there, buddy.
[36:37.720 --> 36:38.800]  You don't know what you're talking about.
[36:38.860 --> 36:39.540]  It's just a crown.
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.620]  And they looked at it, and there was just something wrong with the crown.
[36:43.800 --> 36:45.500]  I don't know, they said there was, like, an imperfection in it,
[36:45.500 --> 36:48.260]  and it seemed like it was just agitating my tooth, but that my root was fine,
[36:48.340 --> 36:50.720]  and so they took it off, and I have a temporary crown,
[36:51.140 --> 36:56.540]  and I have to go back Monday, this next Monday, to run another test
[36:56.540 --> 37:01.400]  to see if there's any inflammation, and if so, then I have to get a root canal.
[37:01.400 --> 37:07.840]  If not, then they ordered me a new crown, and then I go back in a month
[37:07.840 --> 37:09.520]  and get the new crown put on.
[37:09.680 --> 37:12.500]  But at a minimum, I have a temporary crown for a month,
[37:12.600 --> 37:15.220]  or I'm getting a root canal next week, and I don't know which yet.
[37:16.140 --> 37:17.080]  Oh, man.
[37:17.440 --> 37:18.580]  It's never ending.
[37:19.160 --> 37:20.160]  It's just never ending.
[37:20.920 --> 37:27.540]  Literally, two days after I get my electric and my power and internet and everything turned back on,
[37:27.820 --> 37:31.160]  and I go, okay, it's been a hell of a week, it's been a hell of a year,
[37:31.160 --> 37:34.620]  I've got the stitches, I've got the cut-up hand already, we've had the icepocalypse,
[37:34.820 --> 37:40.540]  I just want to have a weekend where I can relax and celebrate my fiancé's birthday
[37:40.540 --> 37:44.100]  and spend time with friends and just chill the fuck out.
[37:44.300 --> 37:49.540]  And then immediately, the universe was like, I'm gonna kick you so hard in the dick right now,
[37:49.780 --> 37:50.640]  your head's gonna spin.
[37:51.620 --> 37:55.260]  This is like the third year of root canals since this podcast started.
[37:55.560 --> 37:55.980]  I know.
[37:56.500 --> 37:57.420]  Tell you what, though.
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.480]  I'm not gonna let it get me down.
[38:00.480 --> 38:02.920]  I'm refusing to be upset about it.
[38:03.060 --> 38:04.320]  I'm refusing to be bummed.
[38:04.640 --> 38:07.260]  I'm not gonna let 2023 be like 2022.
[38:07.960 --> 38:10.560]  So, I'm gonna try my best to maintain a positive attitude.
[38:10.860 --> 38:14.040]  We'll see if the universe beats that out of me over the course of the next few months,
[38:14.140 --> 38:17.600]  but as of right now, even with a potential root canal on the horizon,
[38:18.600 --> 38:20.320]  I'm maintaining a sunny disposition.
[38:20.820 --> 38:25.100]  Can you get custom crowns with, like, could you get, like, the f*** face logo on a crown?
[38:25.600 --> 38:26.800]  I don't know. Probably.
[38:27.000 --> 38:27.620]  Eric says yes.
[38:28.380 --> 38:30.100]  You can get that with, like, fake teeth and stuff, too.
[38:30.580 --> 38:31.240]  That'd be cool.
[38:31.340 --> 38:33.460]  How many crowns do you have, Geoff?
[38:34.300 --> 38:37.180]  Oh, I don't know. Um, two, maybe?
[38:37.460 --> 38:37.760]  Two?
[38:38.020 --> 38:38.320]  Two or three.
[38:38.340 --> 38:41.520]  It's just when you're saying that, like, without context, the sentence,
[38:41.720 --> 38:44.480]  I'm ordering a new crown sounds f***ing awesome.
[38:44.880 --> 38:47.340]  But once you apply the context to it, it really ruins it.
[38:47.620 --> 38:49.020]  Yeah, it does. It's not that...
[38:49.020 --> 38:50.900]  Turns out crowns aren't always fun.
[38:51.320 --> 38:55.100]  It's like the most cool descriptor for a thing not cool at all.
[38:55.600 --> 38:56.020]  So, Monday?
[38:56.400 --> 38:56.740]  What's that?
[38:56.820 --> 38:57.620]  We find out on Monday?
[38:57.820 --> 38:59.160]  Monday at 10 a.m. I go to the...
[38:59.160 --> 39:01.240]  Monday at 10 a.m. I'm going to put that in my own calendar.
[39:01.620 --> 39:03.360]  Monday at noon, checking on Geoff.
[39:03.740 --> 39:03.880]  Yeah.
[39:04.200 --> 39:06.960]  I had a thing that happened the other day that reminded me of you, Geoff,
[39:07.040 --> 39:13.160]  where I feel like for a lot of your life, you've had a filter that you ignore constantly,
[39:13.200 --> 39:17.240]  where it's like, oh, I could make a joke here and annoy the person I'm talking to,
[39:17.260 --> 39:18.080]  or I could just hold it in.
[39:18.200 --> 39:20.920]  And more often than not, you would go for the joke because it made you laugh.
[39:21.460 --> 39:23.520]  And I feel like I've always appreciated that approach.
[39:24.600 --> 39:30.000]  And I've had to put up certain filters since moving here, just so I don't offend people.
[39:31.040 --> 39:34.620]  And I must have been tired the other day again, and it was just gone.
[39:34.760 --> 39:36.780]  The filter was gone. I just couldn't stop it.
[39:37.240 --> 39:41.580]  I was taking a bunch of camera equipment to film like a rocket test.
[39:41.740 --> 39:44.260]  I had a bunch of pellet cases and tripod and stuff.
[39:44.920 --> 39:46.620]  And an Uber driver picked me up and was like,
[39:47.460 --> 39:49.080]  oh, you filming something?
[39:49.260 --> 39:51.180]  And I just looked at him and I just said, how could you tell?
[39:52.180 --> 39:56.240]  And I feel like, like growing up in England, the other guy would have been like,
[39:56.300 --> 39:58.720]  ah, how you little, you know, little rascal.
[39:59.020 --> 39:59.780]  Of course you are.
[40:00.600 --> 40:03.400]  This guy looked at me like he wanted to murder me.
[40:03.520 --> 40:05.040]  And I was like, oh, this is...
[40:05.040 --> 40:11.060]  Why didn't my British to US filter come on to block the sarcasm?
[40:11.200 --> 40:14.520]  And it just came out without me. I could not stop it.
[40:14.900 --> 40:19.700]  And I've not felt that guilty in so long.
[40:19.700 --> 40:21.600]  It was just, it would have been so innocent in England.
[40:21.900 --> 40:23.120]  I don't think I would have offended anyone.
[40:24.120 --> 40:26.520]  He looked at me like I was a piece of shit.
[40:26.780 --> 40:29.580]  And I just felt, I sat in silence the entire way.
[40:29.660 --> 40:31.200]  It was like a 40 minute ride.
[40:32.260 --> 40:35.000]  You know what's even worse? You know, he gave you a one star review.
[40:35.180 --> 40:38.440]  I know! And I gave him five and a big old tip.
[40:38.920 --> 40:41.940]  I found out on a, Emily showed me a TikTok the other day where you can,
[40:42.060 --> 40:44.700]  shows how to look up and see how many one star reviews you've had.
[40:44.860 --> 40:46.240]  Don't do it. It's depressing.
[40:46.740 --> 40:47.380]  Oh no.
[40:47.740 --> 40:48.760]  Do you think you've had a lot of ones?
[40:48.760 --> 40:50.760]  That one is probably my first one.
[40:50.900 --> 40:52.080]  I've got, I've had like six.
[40:53.040 --> 40:54.060]  Six one star?
[40:54.160 --> 40:55.800]  What would you have been doing to deserve?
[40:56.100 --> 41:00.440]  Honestly, honestly, probably very similar situations to yours.
[41:02.240 --> 41:03.300]  Just not filtering.
[41:03.420 --> 41:05.500]  We're just not feeling, just not feeling like it.
[41:05.600 --> 41:07.900]  And just, you know, being a dick.
[41:07.940 --> 41:08.620]  Oh man.
[41:10.260 --> 41:12.820]  Not having my sarcasm filter on. Yeah.
[41:13.300 --> 41:17.180]  I had one once where I was going to the airport with Dan.
[41:17.180 --> 41:20.540]  And Dan has a habit of farting in other people's cars.
[41:20.840 --> 41:23.700]  He'll just let, just let the most not.
[41:23.880 --> 41:27.780]  And he always blames it on the fact that he's like, you know,
[41:27.780 --> 41:30.420]  we've talked about how bad farts and shits can get when you're,
[41:30.520 --> 41:33.560]  when you've just traveled and he's typically off a plane from England
[41:33.560 --> 41:35.220]  and he's suddenly dealing with a new diet.
[41:35.260 --> 41:40.220]  And he lets rip just the most repugnant, awful smells.
[41:40.220 --> 41:46.160]  And we once had a driver just start swearing,
[41:46.280 --> 41:47.980]  looking like looking straight forward to swearing.
[41:48.120 --> 41:50.740]  And then he reached, he reached into his glove box
[41:50.740 --> 41:55.660]  and just started spraying for breath back over his shoulder into our faces.
[41:56.720 --> 41:59.280]  I definitely got one start for that.
[42:00.640 --> 42:02.860]  And I'm there just going, I'm just embarrassed.
[42:02.860 --> 42:04.780]  I'm like, Dan, for Christ's sake.
[42:05.020 --> 42:06.240]  And he's like, it's not my fault.
[42:06.240 --> 42:09.240]  And the guy's just like...
[42:10.480 --> 42:13.360]  What's great about that is you could do anything at that point
[42:13.360 --> 42:14.600]  because you're already at one.
[42:14.720 --> 42:14.920]  Yeah.
[42:15.080 --> 42:16.300]  There's no, you can't get worse.
[42:17.820 --> 42:21.020]  It's amazing how, how rude the pandemic made us all.
[42:21.200 --> 42:22.680]  Like I've, I was rude to begin with,
[42:22.680 --> 42:26.620]  but I have lost any kind of social niceties about burping or farting in public.
[42:27.120 --> 42:28.660]  I don't even, you don't even think about it anymore.
[42:29.440 --> 42:32.580]  Yesterday, Emily got home from work and I went outside to say hi to her.
[42:32.800 --> 42:34.140]  And right as she opened her car door,
[42:34.140 --> 42:37.540]  I went to say hi and a burp came out and I just let it rip.
[42:37.560 --> 42:43.520]  And it was so fucking loud that a couple across the street was walking their dog.
[42:43.760 --> 42:46.160]  And the guy goes, we heard that!
[42:46.680 --> 42:48.140]  And I was like, Jesus Christ!
[42:49.460 --> 42:50.640]  I think I was three houses over.
[42:51.240 --> 42:55.620]  And then, dude, two days ago, I sneezed so loud in the house,
[42:55.720 --> 42:57.960]  it set the glass break sensor off in the apartment.
[43:01.280 --> 43:02.140]  No way!
[43:02.140 --> 43:04.660]  I swear to God, Emily can corroborate.
[43:05.120 --> 43:06.520]  It's in my notes, actually.
[43:08.700 --> 43:10.500]  I've started sneezing loud.
[43:11.320 --> 43:13.860]  I've started sneezing loud because it annoys Emily.
[43:14.120 --> 43:15.360]  She doesn't like it, a loud sneeze.
[43:15.560 --> 43:18.860]  And so I've been trying to sneeze, like, loud just to piss her off.
[43:19.820 --> 43:22.960]  But now I don't realize, now I can't stop it.
[43:23.800 --> 43:26.320]  Earlier in this podcast, what I brought up,
[43:26.380 --> 43:29.900]  that you would constantly be throwing to Eric if you knew you weren't supposed to,
[43:29.900 --> 43:34.780]  and your outrage over the accusation to that story of,
[43:35.380 --> 43:37.920]  Emily hates loud sneezes, so you're trying to amplify.
[43:38.440 --> 43:42.080]  Not just that you're doing them, you're actively trying to increase your volume.
[43:43.060 --> 43:44.300]  I failed to see the connection.
[43:45.860 --> 43:49.020]  Anyway, once I started sneezing loud, I can't stop now.
[43:49.460 --> 43:52.320]  That's like, one time in high school, I got real nervous about farting,
[43:52.380 --> 43:54.060]  so I started, I taught myself how to fart quietly,
[43:54.340 --> 43:57.580]  and then farts became cool again, and then I couldn't fart with noise,
[43:57.580 --> 44:00.460]  and it took me years to build up a noisy fart again.
[44:01.560 --> 44:02.440]  Farts became cool.
[44:02.520 --> 44:08.140]  I can't make a sound, like, my sneezes are, like, decibel shattering.
[44:09.040 --> 44:10.820]  Apparently there are alarms setting off now.
[44:11.020 --> 44:12.640]  A loud sneeze is so satisfying, though.
[44:13.220 --> 44:16.600]  I do it when I'm alone, I just blast them out onto the floor.
[44:17.040 --> 44:17.720]  It's so satisfying.
[44:18.700 --> 44:21.580]  Blast them out? You're so fucking weird.
[44:21.900 --> 44:24.340]  You're blasting sneezes onto the floor?
[44:24.460 --> 44:27.220]  Well, usually, you know, in public, I'm, like, going into my arm,
[44:27.220 --> 44:29.320]  like, my inverse elbow bit.
[44:29.440 --> 44:30.300]  Oh, I see what you mean.
[44:30.560 --> 44:34.120]  So I have it just to be like, there's no one around, I'm firing this.
[44:35.860 --> 44:38.820]  So, you know, ones where, like, if it's backlit, you're gonna see it.
[44:38.880 --> 44:39.080]  Yeah.
[44:39.320 --> 44:39.740]  Love them.
[44:40.020 --> 44:43.080]  Oh, man. I was just gonna ask, how many sneezes are you guys?
[44:43.540 --> 44:45.460]  I'm almost always a three sneeze man.
[44:45.780 --> 44:46.420]  I'm a single.
[44:47.360 --> 44:48.880]  You only fire singles?
[44:48.940 --> 44:49.440]  I'm one and done every time.
[44:49.460 --> 44:51.860]  Really? That's so not satisfying.
[44:52.160 --> 44:54.700]  Yeah, no, I'm two. Two every time.
[44:54.700 --> 45:02.140]  Meg has two, so I always say bless after the first one and you after the second one. Without fail.
[45:02.400 --> 45:05.900]  Do you guys remember when I told you... I have so much little dumb stuff today.
[45:05.980 --> 45:10.540]  Do you guys remember how I told you that frustration I had where I have to turn my TV off in my bedroom twice?
[45:10.940 --> 45:11.140]  Yeah.
[45:11.520 --> 45:13.620]  I can't make it stop.
[45:14.060 --> 45:21.100]  I didn't tell you guys this, I don't think, but about two weeks ago or three weeks ago, before the ice storm, it just started working again.
[45:21.580 --> 45:24.800]  I just hit the button. I've done nothing to it.
[45:25.240 --> 45:27.020]  And it just starts working again.
[45:27.420 --> 45:34.000]  But I realized last night, because right about the time it started working, the power lost, went out, and then we were gone for a while.
[45:34.080 --> 45:36.080]  So I've just now started getting back to watching TV in my bedroom.
[45:36.320 --> 45:44.980]  I realized that now that it turns off with one power button push, now the volume no longer works.
[45:46.300 --> 45:46.700]  What?
[45:46.700 --> 45:51.700]  So now I can turn my TV on and off easily, but I cannot change the volume.
[45:52.520 --> 45:53.160]  Just out of the blue.
[45:54.160 --> 45:54.880]  It's like it flipped.
[45:55.340 --> 45:58.120]  Before the volume worked fine, I just had to turn the TV off twice.
[45:58.360 --> 46:01.140]  Now I turn it off once, and the volume just doesn't fucking work.
[46:01.220 --> 46:03.520]  And I am befuddled on how to fix this.
[46:03.760 --> 46:08.400]  I had the same happen with one of my... I think after it updated, the volume stopped working for my TV.
[46:08.660 --> 46:09.880]  I feel like I just forgot the remote.
[46:10.140 --> 46:11.000]  How did you fix it?
[46:11.220 --> 46:12.980]  I just started using the TV remote again.
[46:12.980 --> 46:15.860]  See, I don't know where my TV remote is. I'll have to find it.
[46:16.400 --> 46:17.300]  It's a whole fucking thing.
[46:19.480 --> 46:23.000]  What a weird thing for your TV to update out of your remote.
[46:23.580 --> 46:25.680]  What a strange future innovation.
[46:26.100 --> 46:28.020]  That's one of the most annoying things about the modern world.
[46:28.780 --> 46:33.080]  You can leave stuff exactly where you left it and come back to it and it's different.
[46:33.540 --> 46:35.540]  Because the internet did something to it.
[46:36.300 --> 46:36.620]  Yeah.
[46:37.480 --> 46:38.880]  I never update anything.
[46:39.800 --> 46:41.700]  I feel like that's the move.
[46:41.700 --> 46:44.160]  You never even downloaded Discord.
[46:44.680 --> 46:48.160]  No, but you're on my... Listen, that was a very sharp tone by you.
[46:48.240 --> 46:50.000]  And you're on my team last week about it.
[46:50.080 --> 46:53.100]  Just the same, you said. Exact same experience.
[46:53.860 --> 46:55.160]  I don't want to hear that energy.
[46:55.740 --> 46:58.960]  You're team website Discord. You're browser Discord guy now.
[46:59.080 --> 47:00.560]  Yeah, I'm back on the desktop now.
[47:00.560 --> 47:06.080]  Hey, Gavin, to be honest, after what you've said about coming and sneezing and foot piss,
[47:06.180 --> 47:09.140]  I don't even know if I want you on the web browser Discord side anymore.
[47:09.140 --> 47:12.420]  I need to consider, like, I need to evaluate the roster.
[47:12.700 --> 47:14.020]  You're disowning me from that team.
[47:14.980 --> 47:16.600]  Possibly. It's up for review.
[47:16.980 --> 47:20.600]  I'll get back to you when I go through a thorough investigation of everything.
[47:20.940 --> 47:23.060]  But it's up for review.
[47:23.400 --> 47:24.720]  Okay, I'm on probation.
[47:26.960 --> 47:28.420]  Are you on the app right now?
[47:29.920 --> 47:31.880]  No, I'm back on the desktop app.
[47:32.080 --> 47:33.680]  Fuck, okay. God damn it.
[47:34.920 --> 47:36.120]  Yeah, I just reinstalled.
[47:36.580 --> 47:39.240]  Oh, you're on the app. You're back on the way you said that.
[47:39.360 --> 47:40.360]  Okay, no, it's good.
[47:40.600 --> 47:42.640]  I uninstalled it and reinstalled it.
[47:42.800 --> 47:44.220]  Stay on there for a little bit.
[47:44.300 --> 47:46.480]  Let me know when I can come back, though.
[47:46.620 --> 47:47.380]  Yeah, I'll let you know.
[47:47.580 --> 47:49.480]  That made me laugh so hard I got dizzy for a second.
[47:49.740 --> 47:50.400]  Oh, my God.
[47:51.940 --> 47:58.880]  Did you guys see that video somebody posted on the F*** Face subreddit of 50 Cent talking about getting shot in the face and the pain level?
[47:59.060 --> 47:59.240]  No.
[47:59.900 --> 48:01.020]  He got shot in his face?
[48:01.240 --> 48:02.780]  He was shot nine times.
[48:02.780 --> 48:04.760]  Yeah, that's his claim to fame.
[48:05.060 --> 48:05.860]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[48:06.340 --> 48:18.140]  Yeah, he said in this interview that somebody that was clipped on the F*** Face subreddit that getting shot in the face hurts less than a root canal.
[48:19.320 --> 48:25.920]  So basically what I'm saying is that 50 Cent is saying that I've essentially been shot like six times in the face.
[48:27.020 --> 48:31.060]  I can say that I've essentially been shot in the face five or six times.
[48:32.720 --> 48:35.440]  Yeah, I guess it like probably contextually, right?
[48:35.520 --> 48:38.780]  Like, I assume he didn't know he was going to get shot in the face when it happened.
[48:38.940 --> 48:39.400]  I don't think so.
[48:39.440 --> 48:40.980]  But you know a root canal is coming.
[48:41.260 --> 48:41.440]  Yeah.
[48:42.000 --> 48:45.980]  There's never been a drive-by root canal, which would be horrendous.
[48:46.100 --> 48:48.000]  I think that'd be the worst case scenario.
[48:48.040 --> 48:49.000]  That'd be a bad one, yeah.
[48:49.260 --> 48:50.360]  It would be, yeah.
[48:51.040 --> 48:53.000]  Yeah, I don't...
[48:53.440 --> 48:55.260]  What happened to you? I got mugged.
[48:55.580 --> 48:56.600]  He root canaled me.
[48:56.700 --> 48:58.840]  He stole my root.
[48:58.840 --> 49:01.880]  He took my wallet and my root.
[49:03.760 --> 49:07.800]  Oh, I would give so much up before I was willing for them to take my root.
[49:07.920 --> 49:09.100]  I will throw my wallet.
[49:09.400 --> 49:11.220]  I will run if you're coming after my root.
[49:11.860 --> 49:12.660]  Anything but the root.
[49:12.740 --> 49:14.040]  Do they take the root in a root canal?
[49:16.080 --> 49:18.040]  I don't... do they take it?
[49:18.120 --> 49:19.040]  Don't they eat the root?
[49:19.600 --> 49:21.200]  No, you have multiple roots.
[49:21.860 --> 49:22.260]  Really?
[49:22.520 --> 49:25.100]  You have like three roots in your tooth and they take the one that's...
[49:25.100 --> 49:27.520]  So that's how you can have multiple root canals on the same tooth?
[49:27.520 --> 49:32.460]  Yeah, and then if you lose all your roots, then you lose your tooth and they just fucking yank it.
[49:33.000 --> 49:34.880]  It seems weird that you only get two goes at teeth.
[49:36.380 --> 49:37.100]  It does.
[49:37.340 --> 49:40.240]  I could have done with like maybe one set every 20 years.
[49:41.640 --> 49:46.380]  Well, I still have my wisdom teeth and I feel like they're my backup tires, is the way I view them.
[49:46.980 --> 49:49.840]  I'm supposed to get them removed, but the fact...
[49:49.840 --> 49:54.040]  No, but the fact I still got them, I just feel like I got some extras at the chamber if I needed.
[49:54.120 --> 49:57.140]  You don't lose like a canine and they put one of your wisdoms there, what do you mean?
[49:57.140 --> 50:00.600]  Well, no, I just, I feel like it gives me a false sense of security.
[50:00.820 --> 50:05.440]  Like I know logically what you're saying is accurate, but in my head, I got a few backup tires in my mouth.
[50:05.520 --> 50:06.580]  He's got a spare in the trunk.
[50:06.720 --> 50:10.200]  It's like saying that I got a spare in the trunk, but I have to use it in the trunk.
[50:10.300 --> 50:11.720]  Like, what do you mean? How's that affect it?
[50:13.060 --> 50:13.700]  Well, listen...
[50:13.700 --> 50:14.840]  Just start spinning in there.
[50:15.220 --> 50:17.300]  From a numbers perspective, it would make sense.
[50:17.860 --> 50:19.020]  Down a tooth, up a tooth.
[50:19.440 --> 50:19.920]  If it emerges.
[50:20.200 --> 50:21.420]  I don't know how I'd even pull it.
[50:21.460 --> 50:22.220]  I guess I'd have to...
[50:22.660 --> 50:27.580]  Could I get my wisdom teeth pulled and then put it into my mouth if I wanted to somewhere?
[50:27.980 --> 50:28.440]  Probably not.
[50:29.200 --> 50:29.440]  What do you mean?
[50:29.580 --> 50:35.000]  What if I did like dentures? Like a denture, but it was just like wisdom teeth.
[50:35.120 --> 50:39.500]  Yeah, but then you can do whatever. You can do like dog teeth. Like if you're talking about dentures, it'll have to be your teeth.
[50:39.500 --> 50:42.620]  You're not fucking weird, Eric. I'm not going to put dog teeth in my mouth.
[50:42.620 --> 50:44.020]  Oh, maybe Eric's the weird one.
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.380]  Gavin is doing whatever he can to take the weirdness off me.
[50:49.520 --> 50:51.260]  I'm trying to say the most normal shit.
[50:52.020 --> 51:00.460]  Putting your own teeth back in your head after they get pulled is like, this is so insane to me. I never thought about, ever thought about that.
[51:00.660 --> 51:03.680]  Can you imagine a full smile of just wisdom teeth?
[51:04.060 --> 51:05.340]  Oh my God.
[51:06.640 --> 51:08.280]  So fucking big.
[51:09.420 --> 51:10.460]  Giant blocks.
[51:11.040 --> 51:13.480]  The toothiest grin you've ever seen.
[51:16.140 --> 51:21.020]  How do, how did the wisdom, how does a tooth get made? Do we start with teeth?
[51:21.020 --> 51:23.100]  How does anything get made? You grow it.
[51:23.220 --> 51:30.000]  Okay. Well, yeah, but can I put it back in? And like, could I grow more teeth if I wanted? Like, why does my mouth just stop?
[51:30.120 --> 51:35.960]  That's what I'm saying. It's like DNA tells your body to grow two sets. And I think, well, you can see x-rays of kids, right?
[51:35.980 --> 51:40.280]  Where they have all their teeth, but they have all their adult teeth just sitting dormant above their adult teeth.
[51:40.280 --> 51:41.720]  Where you're something that you don't want to look at.
[51:42.220 --> 51:43.700]  Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
[51:43.880 --> 51:45.700]  Look how low down that one is.
[51:46.000 --> 51:50.460]  If that guy like smashed his chin, like riding a bike, one of his teeth could come out the bottom.
[51:50.960 --> 51:56.500]  I would say, looking at this photo of all the, it's like normal teeth and then all your compartments for teeth.
[51:56.840 --> 52:01.620]  If somebody mugged me and stole a tooth, I'd be like, fucking idiot. They don't know I got 20 more.
[52:01.880 --> 52:04.200]  I got 20 more they could have taken, not even visible.
[52:04.380 --> 52:06.500]  They didn't check my hidden compartments.
[52:07.220 --> 52:12.140]  Also, look how freaking weird that wisdom tooth looks. Like, imagine a full set of them.
[52:12.400 --> 52:15.060]  That's what Andrew wants. To put them in the front?
[52:15.300 --> 52:16.380]  Wisdom's the one right at the back.
[52:16.380 --> 52:21.100]  They look like, they look like the little hats you put on like rack of lamb.
[52:21.420 --> 52:22.340]  After you...
[52:23.620 --> 52:24.740]  Chicken leg or something.
[52:25.220 --> 52:29.220]  I would look like an extra to Flintstones movie if I had a full rack of those.
[52:29.420 --> 52:32.540]  Like it's the, it's like a prehistoric vibe you get from them.
[52:33.020 --> 52:37.580]  Dude, that guy's got teeth up by his nose, down by his chin. It's, it's horrible.
[52:38.800 --> 52:47.060]  Do you guys remember earlier when Gavin thought the most logical solution to a problem was to stick his bare foot in a, into a bowl of piss?
[52:47.540 --> 52:50.200]  And use it as a, and use it as a little monkey hand?
[52:50.720 --> 52:52.520]  Well, he said do a goat kick.
[52:52.880 --> 52:53.580]  Yeah, a goat kick.
[52:54.700 --> 52:58.880]  I'm gonna be thinking about, I think I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be thinking about that for weeks.
[52:59.680 --> 53:03.140]  I was just trying to keep my hands clean. It's just another appendage.
[53:03.620 --> 53:06.560]  Okay, but let's just like realistically go through the motions of a goat kick.
[53:06.560 --> 53:09.380]  A goat kick is backwards, right? So you're going toes in.
[53:09.520 --> 53:12.720]  Yeah, in my head I'm, I'm, I'm like Len on the cistern.
[53:12.920 --> 53:14.900]  So you're standing over the toilet.
[53:15.260 --> 53:15.440]  Yeah.
[53:15.520 --> 53:15.880]  Okay.
[53:16.140 --> 53:17.860]  And I'm like back-footing it out.
[53:18.160 --> 53:20.720]  Are you on the toilet? Like are both feet on?
[53:20.860 --> 53:20.940]  No.
[53:20.940 --> 53:21.760]  Okay, so one's to the side.
[53:22.040 --> 53:30.020]  I start straddling the toilet and then I sort of like lean on the tank and then I do like a back pass on the handle as it flies out.
[53:30.020 --> 53:35.960]  Now that's way better than just putting your hand in and grabbing it and then moving on with your, with your day. Just advancing.
[53:36.900 --> 53:38.420]  It was a terrible idea by you.
[53:39.320 --> 53:40.920]  I already came around to it.
[53:41.080 --> 53:44.780]  I know, I know, I just, I was struck again by it.
[53:44.800 --> 53:47.000]  It was just so hard to bring it back up.
[53:47.580 --> 53:48.460]  There's someone out there.
[53:51.600 --> 53:57.760]  It would be like if I said, what if you use both elbows to fish it out? Cause you don't really use those, like that's fine.
[53:57.760 --> 54:01.540]  Like I would, I think I'd actually rather my elbows than my foot.
[54:01.840 --> 54:05.320]  I would agree. If my elbow could fit deep enough into the ball, I would use that.
[54:06.240 --> 54:10.780]  Like both of them and like a trap, like you're trying to pinch it with your elbows.
[54:10.860 --> 54:12.040]  They just wouldn't fit in though, would they?
[54:12.640 --> 54:20.900]  No, I don't think I could do that. Yeah. But if I had like, I don't know, like John Jones's arms and really like pointy long elbows, I think I can make that work.
[54:21.340 --> 54:22.420]  But that's very specific.
[54:22.840 --> 54:26.040]  I think there's someone in the comments who would have thought about a foot going in.
[54:26.040 --> 54:32.540]  Oh, definitely. I think it's understandable to consider it, but to then act like that should be the plan.
[54:32.780 --> 54:34.100]  And to advocate for it, yeah.
[54:34.300 --> 54:36.020]  Yeah, that's the, that's the issue.
[54:36.340 --> 54:43.800]  Did you guys put, you want to put yourself on the level of a comment leaver who's saying like, oh, I left this comment about how I'd also do a goat kick in the toilet?
[54:44.160 --> 54:46.900]  Yeah, I mean, I can't, that's where I came from, Eric. I'm a comment leaver.
[54:46.900 --> 54:48.860]  Yeah, I'm a comment leaver too.
[54:49.800 --> 54:52.520]  Those are Gavin's people. Goat kickers unite.
[54:52.540 --> 54:58.000]  Let us know in the comments if you'd do a goat kick in your piss toilet to get a cabinet knockout.
[54:58.980 --> 55:05.840]  I think my issue with the comment leaver comment, Gavin, by you is stating that there's some, like someone would have done that.
[55:06.240 --> 55:12.760]  That doesn't mean a whole lot. And also, like, who is that person? Like, you might not actually want to align with that, that individual.
[55:13.140 --> 55:15.680]  Just because there is one doesn't actually prove anything.
[55:15.680 --> 55:19.080]  I just feel like a foot is a go-to when you don't want to touch something.
[55:20.720 --> 55:25.000]  Yeah? You're still touching it. I don't know. Your foot is attached to you, just so you know.
[55:25.880 --> 55:26.840]  Like, what do you mean by that?
[55:27.460 --> 55:28.260]  I don't know. Yeah.
[55:28.380 --> 55:37.940]  I think you just really... we're talking about Micah Parsons before you joined. In Pleasantries, being a foot guy who loves feet, you are like the reverse of a foot guy.
[55:38.020 --> 55:40.540]  I hate feet. I want nothing to do with them.
[55:40.760 --> 55:44.220]  You have like a hatred fetish of feet as opposed to liking feet.
[55:44.220 --> 55:50.180]  I don't want to touch one. They're not attractive. They're dirty. No thanks.
[55:50.300 --> 55:56.280]  You ever looked at a foot and said, like, hmm, that's a good looking foot.
[55:56.420 --> 55:58.240]  Actually, you won't believe this.
[55:58.240 --> 55:59.220]  No. Never.
[55:59.480 --> 56:05.400]  Just this week, I saw my first foot that I was like, actually, that's a pretty good foot.
[56:05.540 --> 56:06.920]  You are so weird.
[56:06.920 --> 56:17.520]  It was Katy Perry. Katy Perry tweeted. She had on Instagram. I think she started selling a shoe or something to do with the foot model that she posted.
[56:17.620 --> 56:21.080]  I was like, okay, that's probably the best looking foot. And I still didn't want to do anything with it.
[56:21.140 --> 56:26.460]  I wouldn't want to touch it, but I had to admit, of all the feet I've seen, that was probably the best one.
[56:26.720 --> 56:30.320]  Well, I have yet to see a foot that I feel that way about.
[56:30.800 --> 56:31.720]  Let me try and find it.
[56:32.900 --> 56:36.360]  No, I'm good, I think. I think I'm good. I'm pretty sure I'm good.
[56:36.360 --> 56:37.540]  That was right there with you.
[56:37.880 --> 56:41.280]  That's the one. Yeah, I was like, okay, that's actually a pretty inoffensive foot.
[56:42.100 --> 56:47.760]  That's just a fucking foot, dude. It looks exactly like every other foot I've ever seen.
[56:48.380 --> 56:48.920]  I don't know.
[56:49.620 --> 56:51.080]  You want to cover that in piss.
[56:51.480 --> 56:51.760]  I don't.
[56:53.540 --> 56:55.000]  You want to goat kick that.
[56:55.760 --> 56:57.180]  No, you're making it so weird.
[56:58.220 --> 57:00.340]  You know, we're just saying what you said.
[57:00.920 --> 57:04.400]  No, I'm just saying that was the best one I've seen yet.
[57:04.400 --> 57:05.960]  And I still...
[57:07.780 --> 57:12.360]  Imagine Geoff looking at a foot and saying, that's the best one I've seen yet.
[57:13.100 --> 57:14.140]  I definitely...
[57:14.140 --> 57:16.860]  Surely you've once seen a sandwich.
[57:17.180 --> 57:17.820]  No, no.
[57:19.300 --> 57:24.340]  Here's the problem. It means you're taking inventory. It means you're taking inventory, and that's strange.
[57:24.720 --> 57:28.460]  You have a Rolodex in your head of feet, and you're like, that one's the best one.
[57:28.760 --> 57:30.380]  Yeah, it's that you had the thought.
[57:31.760 --> 57:33.700]  I think that happens unintentionally, doesn't it?
[57:33.700 --> 57:35.420]  You just sort of file stuff away.
[57:35.900 --> 57:41.780]  Could you imagine, Gavin, if you and I were in the same room together, and I said, you've got to come over here and see this.
[57:41.860 --> 57:44.320]  This is the best foot I've seen in 28 years of living.
[57:44.640 --> 57:44.780]  Listen.
[57:45.180 --> 57:46.420]  28 years. This is the foot.
[57:46.900 --> 57:48.640]  The thing, I wouldn't be like...
[57:48.640 --> 57:50.620]  I wouldn't be like, guys, you've got to check out this foot.
[57:50.840 --> 57:52.440]  I just mentioned it because it came up.
[57:52.780 --> 57:55.660]  No, it's only because you said, have you ever seen a foot?
[57:55.700 --> 57:56.640]  And I was like, well, it's the perfect.
[57:57.220 --> 57:59.840]  It was in my notes. I was just...
[57:59.840 --> 58:00.480]  Andrew.
[58:01.440 --> 58:02.720]  It's as if...
[58:02.720 --> 58:04.560]  It's as if you were hanging out...
[58:04.560 --> 58:06.600]  We were hanging out, and I was like, hey, Andrew.
[58:06.900 --> 58:09.640]  I'm not one to be sexually attracted to bananas.
[58:10.240 --> 58:11.880]  But look at this fucking banana.
[58:12.220 --> 58:16.060]  You have to admit, if you were going to do something to a banana, this would be the banana, right?
[58:16.900 --> 58:19.660]  No, it would not only make sense if Andrew was suddenly like,
[58:20.060 --> 58:21.520]  Gavin wanted to have sex with a banana?
[58:22.260 --> 58:23.740]  What are you talking about?
[58:24.320 --> 58:25.780]  It came up in conversation.
[58:27.720 --> 58:29.700]  What do you want to do to that foot?
[58:30.180 --> 58:31.800]  I don't want to do anything. It's the point.
[58:31.960 --> 58:35.060]  It's the best looking one I've ever seen, and I want nothing to do with it still.
[58:35.120 --> 58:38.920]  I just have to admit, it's probably the most inoffensive one I've ever seen.
[58:40.040 --> 58:40.400]  Inoffensive?
[58:40.580 --> 58:41.880]  I don't think that's weird.
[58:43.620 --> 58:44.700]  I don't know what...
[58:50.980 --> 58:57.820]  He reacted so strongly to that foot that it stuck in his brain to the point where he could instantly recognize the photo.
[58:58.280 --> 59:01.880]  It was like, this foot has done a number on you, man.
[59:04.000 --> 59:09.480]  You have probably at some point seen the best pastrami sandwich that you've ever witnessed, right?
[59:09.700 --> 59:13.800]  If you're off pastrami, you're probably not going to eat it, but you have to be like, you know what, that one looks really good.
[59:14.280 --> 59:15.200]  You know what, though?
[59:16.440 --> 59:17.800]  I'm not off pastrami.
[59:20.400 --> 59:21.120]  He's back.
[59:21.580 --> 59:23.980]  I pastrami. I pastrami. Hard.
[59:23.980 --> 59:29.340]  But once again, though, sorry, just to counter Gavin's point, this is a thing he loves.
[59:29.980 --> 59:33.680]  That's why he'd remember and catalogue it, because he loves them. He loved them.
[59:33.880 --> 59:38.380]  Then he didn't. Then he fell out of love with it, but the love wasn't...
[59:38.380 --> 59:42.300]  It would make more sense if I was like, God, I used to love to jack off on feet, but then I stopped.
[59:42.560 --> 59:43.640]  It just wasn't any good anymore.
[59:43.980 --> 59:46.880]  But now I think I'm into jacking off on feet again. Like, that's different.
[59:47.100 --> 59:48.160]  It's nothing like that.
[59:48.520 --> 59:50.140]  I think it's pretty much exactly like that.
[59:50.140 --> 59:56.200]  I'm not an architect, but sometimes you see a building that's like, that's a pretty cool building.
[59:56.480 --> 59:57.760]  And you want to fuck it?
[59:58.340 --> 59:58.520]  No!
[59:59.060 --> 01:00:02.220]  But you didn't...
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:06.440]  But you aren't saying that you have, like, hatred for buildings.
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.920]  You said you have hatred for feet.
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:12.360]  Look, I'm not trying to dog pile.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.760]  I'm just...
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.900]  It's very inconsistent to me.
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:21.820]  So it has to be something that I hate, but then recognize that...
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:24.920]  I'm going to find such a good example eventually.
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.740]  This is Gavin's new life hack.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:33.320]  Don't be attracted to feet, but if you are, be attracted to this foot.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:44.420]  Gavin's life hack is when you get dunked on, take your time with it, come back, you'll get them later.
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:53.380]  You've got the rest of your life to think of a comeback. Take your time.
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:01:02.900]  I just think sometimes when you're the opposite of a foot guy, sometimes you have to just...
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:06.580]  Are you alright?
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.740]  Oh no, I'm dying. I'm close to dead.
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:16.180]  We need to find out if that foot model is British, because if so, they need to be a toe-in-the-hole.
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:19.620]  You do need to have an extended toe-in-the-hole.
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:27.020]  It's just like people pop their feet in.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.580]  Women popping big toes through toast.
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:37.840]  Well, I guess you could compare it to like, you know, as a straight man.
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:42.000]  Sometimes you see a guy and it's like, that's a good looking person.
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:45.900]  I don't want to do anything. I wouldn't want to interact with him in that way.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:49.600]  But I recognize that it's... What, Eric? What?
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.880]  Do you hate guys in general?
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.760]  I'm just not attracted to guys in general.
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:01:59.560]  What do you mean?
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:05.360]  Bro, your base is where the feet is. You hate the feet. You're opposed to my feet.
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:11.800]  I've never looked at somebody visually and just thought, that's an inoffensive looking person.
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:14.240]  That's just... they're just people.
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:15.520]  They're just people.
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.960]  I don't know why I can't come up with a good comparison.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:20.860]  What's wrong with this situation?
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:24.080]  No, I think you just need to punt. You need to punt.
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.820]  You need to sit down for a while and revisit this when you get the ball again.
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:28.620]  Down the road.
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:33.600]  I think you're just gonna... you're gonna be like 4th and 80 if you keep going.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.920]  Just punt. Just punt on your third down.
[01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:37.020]  You know, that's good advice.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.320]  Okay, we should wrap this up, I think.
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.240]  Eric's gonna blow a fuse in the Discord chat if we don't.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.300]  Thank you for listening to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:53.800]  If you made it to the end of this one, there should be no doubt in your mind two things.
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:57.540]  One, this is a pretty entertaining podcast. You should probably tell some people about it.
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:00.480]  And two, Gavin is a fucking freak. We'll see you next week.
