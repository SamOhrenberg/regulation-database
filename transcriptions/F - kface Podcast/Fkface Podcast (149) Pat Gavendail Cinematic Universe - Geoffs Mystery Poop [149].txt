[00:00.000 --> 00:01.200]  You ever wonder why we're here?
[00:06.020 --> 00:07.840]  It's one of life's great mysteries, isn't it?
[00:19.310 --> 00:23.370]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:23.650 --> 00:32.130]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Britain's own Gavin Free and the pride of Canada, Andrew Panton.
[00:32.410 --> 00:38.410]  This is episode 149. Behind the scenes, we have Eric and Nick doing whatever it is they do.
[00:38.950 --> 00:40.150]  How's everybody doing today?
[00:40.590 --> 00:41.190]  Good, thanks.
[00:41.890 --> 00:44.650]  I'm doing good. You seem very high energy today, Geoff.
[00:45.430 --> 00:48.370]  I'm in a good mood. I'm in a good mood. I just remembered I have something I want to talk about.
[00:48.470 --> 00:50.270]  About British people. British people.
[00:50.690 --> 00:51.710]  Let me put that in my notes real fast.
[00:52.530 --> 00:53.850]  Is it pie related?
[00:54.530 --> 00:57.150]  No, no, no, no. That was totally unrelated.
[00:57.570 --> 01:01.510]  I just had never heard of a fisherman's pie. It was f***ing disgusting.
[01:01.930 --> 01:04.550]  It was like three different kinds of fish in a brown pie.
[01:05.650 --> 01:07.490]  What if you just want hot fish?
[01:09.010 --> 01:12.310]  Yeah, what if? You just get fish and chips, right? Don't you have plenty of that?
[01:12.530 --> 01:14.510]  Yeah, I feel like that's a much more appetizing way.
[01:14.850 --> 01:20.970]  I was watching Top Chef World All-Stars last night, and the season is in London, and they were making pub food.
[01:22.130 --> 01:26.330]  Everybody's seen like shepherd's pie. I was familiar with that one, but I was not familiar with the fisherman's pie.
[01:26.750 --> 01:35.290]  But I also found out from Gail Simmons that in England, they serve 300 million portions of fish and chips a year.
[01:36.170 --> 01:37.050]  300 million?
[01:37.290 --> 01:42.670]  That's what she said. That's essentially like if virtually every person in the United States ate fish and chips once.
[01:44.170 --> 01:45.730]  We have like 330 million people.
[01:46.130 --> 01:53.930]  So you're saying that if everyone in America really got together for one day, they could output a year's worth of fish and chips?
[01:54.150 --> 01:59.710]  Yeah, but we could do that too. We could bury you guys in pretty much anything in that way, just because of sheer numbers.
[02:02.110 --> 02:11.090]  That feels very American, though. The idea of like one day ever just eating fish and chips and going, fuck yeah, America, number one. We're number one, baby!
[02:11.530 --> 02:12.610]  I've seen fish and chips.
[02:13.250 --> 02:26.090]  I miss that part of America. You know, I listen to a lot of very serious political talk radio when I'm not listening to very serious reality and celebrity gossip radio.
[02:26.870 --> 02:36.210]  And there's been a lot of talking about how like pride in America is at an all time low and individuality is at an all time high and people care less about the greater good.
[02:36.370 --> 02:42.430]  And the idea of American exceptionalism is kind of gone and nobody wants to pull together like we did in the World Wars and stuff.
[02:42.770 --> 02:48.910]  Maybe, maybe America versus England in a fish and chips off is where we get the ball rolling.
[02:49.310 --> 02:58.370]  I will, I will say it's funny you bring that up because I was playing Halo last night and I'm just playing and I'm just playing.
[02:58.550 --> 02:59.690]  Next thing I know, I'm just playing.
[02:59.870 --> 03:01.190]  What was my damn invite?
[03:02.030 --> 03:06.270]  Where was your damn invite? It was 1 a.m. Do you want me to invite you at 1 a.m. when I'm playing Halo Infinite?
[03:06.550 --> 03:08.110]  What's that, 3 a.m. for me?
[03:08.270 --> 03:09.490]  It's 3 a.m. for you, yeah.
[03:10.430 --> 03:11.910]  You did good.
[03:13.750 --> 03:16.010]  I figured, I figured I'd do good.
[03:17.210 --> 03:21.790]  But I was playing and I'm just, you know, relaxing, everything's fine.
[03:21.930 --> 03:25.870]  And then I heard people speaking and it caught me so off guard.
[03:26.010 --> 03:29.390]  I was shocked because you never, nobody speaks in game chat anymore.
[03:29.610 --> 03:33.590]  And I was all excited about it because it reminded me of like Halo 3 era.
[03:33.770 --> 03:37.990]  And it was this conversation that was really stupid and I'm like, oh, this is great.
[03:37.990 --> 03:43.130]  I missed this. And then it immediately turned into them like saying homophobic slur.
[03:43.230 --> 03:45.610]  Just being the worst, the worst people.
[03:46.130 --> 03:48.230]  And it was like, oh, no, yeah, this is what this is.
[03:48.550 --> 03:50.190]  This is the other part.
[03:50.370 --> 03:53.810]  This is like the nostalgia has been lifted.
[03:54.430 --> 03:55.790]  This is what we're dealing with.
[03:56.170 --> 03:58.330]  And they were very excited about America.
[03:58.490 --> 04:04.030]  In between all the homophobia, if they got a kill, they'd be like, fuck yeah, America.
[04:04.170 --> 04:04.790]  America number one.
[04:05.010 --> 04:06.730]  They said it several times.
[04:06.730 --> 04:08.050]  They're very excited.
[04:08.230 --> 04:11.230]  They say there's over 300 million slurs online today.
[04:11.830 --> 04:13.730]  Oh, yeah, we got it.
[04:15.370 --> 04:17.850]  You think you can hop on again tonight at about 1 a.m.
[04:17.870 --> 04:22.390]  Catch those kids and then start talking about how much better fish and chips America is than England.
[04:22.790 --> 04:26.350]  You can start feeding, like start seeding it now and then it'll just spread.
[04:26.790 --> 04:27.590]  I don't know.
[04:27.730 --> 04:29.490]  I don't know if I'll catch him again, but I did.
[04:29.870 --> 04:30.370]  It was great.
[04:30.430 --> 04:33.710]  It was the perfect you're a fucking idiot and you don't even know it.
[04:33.710 --> 04:41.770]  Conclusion where I sabotage one of them at the end of the game to crash their warthog and they wanted to talk shit to me about it.
[04:41.930 --> 04:46.850]  And the last thing they said before the game ended was, where is my push to talk?
[04:47.070 --> 04:54.530]  But they didn't know that they could hire again and they revealed it at the very closing moment.
[04:54.650 --> 04:56.350]  You fucking idiots.
[04:56.690 --> 04:58.010]  You guys suck.
[04:58.230 --> 04:59.030]  You're the worst.
[04:59.030 --> 05:00.450]  I wonder how many.
[05:00.510 --> 05:02.770]  That's probably a uniquely American trait.
[05:02.890 --> 05:07.970]  They're being too fucking dipshit dumb to figure out if you're broadcasting live.
[05:09.290 --> 05:12.190]  I wonder how many people are affected by that.
[05:12.390 --> 05:12.850]  I would be.
[05:12.950 --> 05:16.010]  I wouldn't be surprised if it's a large portion of people who don't know.
[05:16.090 --> 05:22.410]  I guess because there are so few people in game chat that you wouldn't realize there's nobody there to tell you that you're there.
[05:22.570 --> 05:23.870]  You would have no idea.
[05:24.250 --> 05:26.370]  I've played countless games of Halo.
[05:26.510 --> 05:28.390]  I've never heard anyone talking game chat before.
[05:28.390 --> 05:30.250]  I've probably played like 2,000 games.
[05:30.350 --> 05:34.970]  If you didn't know, there's no obvious way that would indicate that you are.
[05:35.470 --> 05:38.050]  I wonder how long they will go before they realize.
[05:38.370 --> 05:39.250]  If they ever will.
[05:39.550 --> 05:41.890]  There might be a new Halo game out before they realize.
[05:42.030 --> 05:44.410]  What if you just started talking? Do you think more people would talk to you?
[05:44.710 --> 05:45.950]  Maybe everyone's just being quiet.
[05:46.890 --> 05:48.570]  Yeah, you think so?
[05:48.730 --> 05:50.970]  What if I'm just gonna talk to myself?
[05:51.330 --> 05:52.870]  What if it's just time of day?
[05:52.870 --> 05:58.730]  What if everybody's being quiet because their partners and their parents are all asleep and they're trying not to wake them up?
[05:58.810 --> 06:01.590]  Maybe it's like really lively right now at 2 in the afternoon.
[06:02.110 --> 06:04.370]  It could be. I guess. I don't know. Maybe we should do some research.
[06:04.490 --> 06:09.590]  There is no greater... I feel like the Xbox party, at least on Xbox, really killed that.
[06:10.190 --> 06:15.490]  I mean, there's some great... I miss some aspects of game chat cultures from like game to game.
[06:15.490 --> 06:19.730]  Like a GTA and Saints Row game chat is a uniquely horrible place.
[06:20.310 --> 06:22.750]  That I sometimes miss being able to pop my head into.
[06:23.070 --> 06:28.650]  I wish it was a click of a button to switch between party chat and game chat instead of having to open the freaking thing and then...
[06:28.650 --> 06:33.910]  If there was just like a... instead of push to talk, it was push to game chat, I would love that.
[06:33.930 --> 06:39.950]  That would be great. Could you take your Xbox Elite controller and program one of those toggles on the back to do something like that?
[06:40.150 --> 06:40.930]  Oh, that's an interesting question.
[06:40.930 --> 06:42.750]  I don't know if you can make like macros.
[06:43.450 --> 06:46.350]  That would rule though. I'd love to just hop in and out.
[06:46.790 --> 06:51.750]  On PC, that's how it works. You can just hear like through it. You don't need to do any adjusting.
[06:52.010 --> 06:53.830]  It's just on console. You need the party flip.
[06:54.430 --> 06:58.230]  But it's always worth it. It's always so great to hear people in game chat in that game.
[06:59.250 --> 07:00.830]  Warzone is a great dumb game chat game.
[07:01.850 --> 07:04.450]  Yeah, you're always hopping in just to...
[07:04.450 --> 07:06.690]  Well, I can't do it because I always laugh and give us away.
[07:12.750 --> 07:14.890]  Hey, do you guys have a lot to talk about today?
[07:15.390 --> 07:18.650]  I have a little bit. Can I drop a mystery quickly?
[07:18.750 --> 07:21.110]  Because I keep forgetting to... I watched...
[07:21.110 --> 07:24.010]  So, I brought this up like two episodes ago.
[07:24.090 --> 07:28.430]  It's not an amazing mystery. It's just a weird thing that there is definitely a mystery too.
[07:29.310 --> 07:30.490]  Is this the doorbell?
[07:31.310 --> 07:33.750]  This is not the doorbell. It's unrelated to the doorbell.
[07:34.170 --> 07:35.750]  Eric says we don't do a preview.
[07:36.810 --> 07:38.650]  We only did it once.
[07:39.130 --> 07:41.010]  And it confused so many people.
[07:41.010 --> 07:43.290]  I don't know how to be more clear about what we were doing.
[07:43.610 --> 07:45.030]  Did it really confuse people?
[07:45.550 --> 07:45.850]  Yes.
[07:46.850 --> 07:51.350]  A lot of people got it and went, hey, that's a really clever, funny, witty idea.
[07:51.790 --> 07:53.010]  Congratulations on pulling that off.
[07:53.190 --> 07:57.050]  And a lot of other people went, I don't know.
[07:57.450 --> 07:58.290]  I don't understand.
[07:59.010 --> 08:00.550]  Maybe I made it more confusing though.
[08:00.570 --> 08:02.910]  Because you were, I think, reading, right?
[08:03.010 --> 08:04.750]  And then I just naturally responded to it.
[08:04.830 --> 08:06.590]  Because I didn't know what you were going to say.
[08:06.690 --> 08:09.750]  But then I couldn't remember where I said it.
[08:09.750 --> 08:11.970]  And it really freaked me out when you actually said it for real.
[08:13.490 --> 08:15.350]  Well, that was kind of the point, right?
[08:15.450 --> 08:17.290]  I didn't expect it to work.
[08:17.510 --> 08:18.570]  At least not perfectly.
[08:19.510 --> 08:24.210]  If I chime in in the preview, I need to write down the word to chime in at.
[08:25.130 --> 08:26.810]  And write down what I chimed in with.
[08:26.910 --> 08:27.830]  Because otherwise, I've lost.
[08:28.310 --> 08:30.250]  I also, for the record, I did.
[08:31.230 --> 08:34.070]  So, I knew I was going to tell a story, right?
[08:34.550 --> 08:36.370]  The Sloppy Joe's police story.
[08:36.750 --> 08:41.550]  So, I just figured I would pull what I thought would be the most, like, a-ha moment from it.
[08:41.890 --> 08:42.750]  And write it down.
[08:43.070 --> 08:44.910]  And so, I just wrote, like, two sentences.
[08:45.310 --> 08:47.430]  And I had no idea how I was going to get to them.
[08:47.510 --> 08:50.270]  Or how I would, when I got to that area, how I would lead into it.
[08:50.390 --> 08:51.290]  And then come out of it.
[08:51.350 --> 08:56.630]  And when I got to those two sentences, I was looking at them at that point in the podcast that I had already said on the preview.
[08:56.890 --> 08:58.070]  And I still didn't say it right.
[08:58.350 --> 09:00.850]  Because within the flow of the conversation, it just didn't work.
[09:01.430 --> 09:03.610]  So, I totally added and changed.
[09:03.670 --> 09:05.290]  And then I was like, I'm really fucking this up myself.
[09:05.290 --> 09:08.830]  So, I wasn't even close to repeating it exactly the way I did.
[09:09.270 --> 09:10.270]  Well, I feel like it was a win.
[09:10.390 --> 09:12.050]  Maybe we should just one-and-done.
[09:12.550 --> 09:13.610]  Yeah, maybe we'll leave it at that.
[09:13.650 --> 09:16.650]  Well, weren't we always one-and-dunning this?
[09:16.830 --> 09:17.090]  I didn't-
[09:17.090 --> 09:17.710]  Yeah, we-
[09:17.710 --> 09:18.190]  That's what I didn't understand.
[09:18.270 --> 09:20.610]  Well, no, we were going to have each of us do one, I think.
[09:20.690 --> 09:23.910]  We had discussed maybe letting each person try it their own different way.
[09:23.990 --> 09:25.150]  Oh, that seems way too much.
[09:25.270 --> 09:26.050]  But yeah, I agree.
[09:26.210 --> 09:27.490]  Not everything needs to be done-
[09:27.490 --> 09:29.350]  Not everybody needs to do everything once.
[09:30.170 --> 09:31.270]  Did we fuck that-
[09:31.270 --> 09:32.030]  Did it-
[09:32.030 --> 09:34.310]  That should have played before the intro of the show did.
[09:34.310 --> 09:35.110]  Did we do that?
[09:35.430 --> 09:35.590]  Yeah.
[09:35.870 --> 09:37.050]  Because most of-
[09:37.050 --> 09:38.010]  Okay, we did.
[09:38.110 --> 09:41.270]  We didn't have the intro, the show start, then that clip, then the episode?
[09:41.430 --> 09:41.990]  Who cares?
[09:42.990 --> 09:44.030]  Well, who cares?
[09:44.190 --> 09:45.110]  I feel like that's a huge-
[09:45.110 --> 09:45.570]  You just-
[09:45.570 --> 09:47.210]  You're like, we're living in the past here.
[09:48.330 --> 09:50.050]  I'm just saying it might be on our end.
[09:50.310 --> 09:54.950]  If we just did the show music, then did the show that way, that is not what we-
[09:54.950 --> 09:55.550]  Yeah, we definitely did that.
[09:55.690 --> 09:55.810]  Yeah.
[09:56.350 --> 09:57.230]  That's exactly how it came out.
[09:57.230 --> 09:57.850]  We just fucked up.
[09:58.110 --> 09:58.870]  That's how we fucked up.
[09:58.870 --> 10:00.050]  I'm pretty sure that's how it came out.
[10:00.110 --> 10:00.270]  Yeah.
[10:00.690 --> 10:01.370]  What's your mystery?
[10:01.890 --> 10:05.810]  My mystery is I've been catching- I've been watching things.
[10:06.170 --> 10:08.430]  I have a huge regret in my life when I was younger.
[10:08.810 --> 10:13.890]  I did the really dumb boy thing of like, oh, that's a girl thing.
[10:13.950 --> 10:15.770]  I'm not interested in that, even though it's awesome.
[10:15.990 --> 10:21.070]  Like, I did not appreciate boy bands nearly as much as I should have when I was growing up.
[10:21.170 --> 10:22.130]  And it's a huge regret.
[10:22.290 --> 10:25.590]  If I could go back in time, correct one thing, boy bands.
[10:25.850 --> 10:26.970]  Pay attention to boy bands.
[10:26.990 --> 10:28.170]  You're in a great boy band era.
[10:28.330 --> 10:28.810]  Embrace it.
[10:28.890 --> 10:29.270]  Enjoy it.
[10:29.290 --> 10:30.030]  I didn't do that.
[10:30.030 --> 10:35.470]  So I've been catching up on, like, things I missed that were kind of on, like, the bubble on my age range.
[10:35.550 --> 10:37.970]  And one of them is the High School Musical series.
[10:37.970 --> 10:39.010]  Never watched any of those.
[10:39.070 --> 10:41.170]  I've recently finished all three movies.
[10:41.370 --> 10:42.490]  I was watching it.
[10:42.710 --> 10:49.010]  And whenever I watch a movie, whenever there's anything that, like, kind of grounds it in a weird alternate way, I need to pursue it.
[10:49.030 --> 10:51.170]  So, like, a website or business or something.
[10:51.690 --> 10:53.390]  So I was watching High School Musical 3.
[10:53.610 --> 10:57.250]  And there's this blatant, really weird Remax advertising shot.
[10:57.370 --> 10:58.550]  Like, clearly they sponsored it.
[10:58.550 --> 10:59.890]  Pat Gavendale.
[11:00.070 --> 11:00.670]  Gavendale.
[11:00.850 --> 11:02.150]  They're selling a house.
[11:02.530 --> 11:03.390]  They're doing that.
[11:03.590 --> 11:04.490]  They're doing their thing.
[11:04.590 --> 11:05.810]  So I looked into it.
[11:05.890 --> 11:08.090]  And I couldn't find anything on it.
[11:08.310 --> 11:12.830]  But then, just randomly, I was watching a different movie.
[11:13.050 --> 11:16.850]  I was watching Be Cool, which came out, like, five years earlier.
[11:17.930 --> 11:20.030]  And there's a scene where a person pulls up.
[11:20.110 --> 11:20.710]  Pat Gavendale!
[11:21.250 --> 11:21.710]  Whoa!
[11:22.450 --> 11:27.870]  We might be in a Pat Gavendale cinematic universe.
[11:27.870 --> 11:30.010]  These are two completely different movies.
[11:30.110 --> 11:31.890]  Made by two different companies.
[11:32.610 --> 11:33.850]  But the same realtor.
[11:34.290 --> 11:35.270]  That's a different sign as well.
[11:35.650 --> 11:37.110]  It's got a tilt to the balloon.
[11:37.210 --> 11:37.510]  Yeah.
[11:38.030 --> 11:38.830]  There's a tilt.
[11:39.050 --> 11:39.910]  There's a slight adjustment.
[11:40.050 --> 11:41.030]  We've gone through eras.
[11:41.910 --> 11:43.130]  I just think this is weird.
[11:43.230 --> 11:44.950]  I can't figure out anything on this.
[11:45.090 --> 11:46.630]  Like, why they chose this name.
[11:47.030 --> 11:48.910]  Is that where we got our new logo from?
[11:48.990 --> 11:50.190]  Look at that shit in the top right.
[11:54.530 --> 11:55.850]  There's the R right there.
[11:57.310 --> 12:00.030]  I think we need to engage the audience.
[12:00.330 --> 12:02.830]  We need to scour all media.
[12:03.230 --> 12:05.090]  And see how many times Pat Gavendale appears.
[12:05.370 --> 12:06.490]  That's exactly what I wanted.
[12:06.550 --> 12:08.830]  I wanted to know if there were any other Pat Gavendale appearances.
[12:08.970 --> 12:11.830]  Because I looked online and I found a website that had one.
[12:12.290 --> 12:14.810]  There's a Remax sign and a Long Cane Polly.
[12:15.290 --> 12:16.970]  But it's just Top Producer.
[12:17.670 --> 12:18.770]  Where's Pat Gavendale?
[12:18.770 --> 12:20.370]  Is Pat Gavendale the Top Producer?
[12:21.390 --> 12:23.030]  I'm very confused by this.
[12:23.270 --> 12:23.630]  Wow.
[12:23.750 --> 12:25.310]  Or they just changed the thing.
[12:25.750 --> 12:28.030]  How are you finding this one?
[12:28.710 --> 12:29.950]  So I just googled.
[12:30.030 --> 12:34.010]  I found a website that tracks product placement in media.
[12:34.710 --> 12:37.270]  And they do a back catalog of just screenshots and stuff.
[12:37.350 --> 12:38.510]  And they had one for a Long Cane Polly.
[12:39.270 --> 12:40.410]  So I found that one that way.
[12:40.970 --> 12:46.830]  I found a... Remax did a contest for who is Pat Gavendale.
[12:46.830 --> 12:51.810]  And one of the people replied that they're the realtor that sold the house in Bachelor Party.
[12:51.970 --> 12:53.310]  The Tom Hanks movie.
[12:53.690 --> 12:56.670]  So I wanted to try to talk about this last week.
[12:56.890 --> 12:58.370]  And we ran out of time.
[12:58.490 --> 13:03.750]  So I watched Bachelor Party on the night before we recorded last week.
[13:04.050 --> 13:06.250]  To prepare. Pat Gavendale's not in that fucking movie.
[13:06.710 --> 13:13.250]  I wasted my time watching Bachelor Party for a reference that never happened.
[13:13.490 --> 13:15.950]  And then never talked about it the following day.
[13:15.950 --> 13:17.550]  I had no reason to watch that one I did.
[13:17.610 --> 13:18.610]  But I was like, I gotta get this in.
[13:19.030 --> 13:19.730]  Never came up.
[13:19.870 --> 13:20.630]  Let me ask you a question.
[13:21.030 --> 13:23.490]  Was that your first time seeing Bachelor Party?
[13:24.070 --> 13:24.810]  It was. Yeah.
[13:25.530 --> 13:26.290]  First and only.
[13:26.770 --> 13:30.590]  So I was a big fan of that movie when I was a kid.
[13:30.890 --> 13:32.450]  Like maybe 9 years old.
[13:33.050 --> 13:35.710]  And when you brought it up I was like, oh fuck, Bachelor Party.
[13:35.770 --> 13:36.530]  That's a classic.
[13:37.150 --> 13:38.870]  Tom Hanks is one of his early...
[13:39.470 --> 13:41.290]  But now it instantly struck me.
[13:41.350 --> 13:42.770]  I bet that movie didn't age well.
[13:43.110 --> 13:43.990]  No it did not.
[13:43.990 --> 13:45.430]  How badly did it age?
[13:45.950 --> 13:47.350]  It aged really poorly.
[13:47.410 --> 13:50.050]  I just don't think it's very funny in a general sense.
[13:50.150 --> 13:51.150]  And yeah, it did not age well.
[13:51.910 --> 13:53.110]  Definitely did not age well.
[13:53.510 --> 13:54.290]  Oh my god.
[13:54.750 --> 13:55.410]  Yeah, it's not great.
[13:55.550 --> 13:56.990]  I wouldn't revisit it if I were you.
[13:57.250 --> 14:02.730]  I would kind of, you know, sort of like me and the game lobbies in Halo.
[14:03.590 --> 14:09.870]  Just remember the good parts fondly and do not revisit it and see some of the stuff that still is part of that.
[14:09.950 --> 14:12.190]  Isn't it interesting though when you watch something that hasn't aged well?
[14:12.230 --> 14:13.590]  I feel like I don't avoid it.
[14:13.590 --> 14:15.750]  It's always quite intriguing like what was acceptable.
[14:16.270 --> 14:17.670]  Sometimes not that long ago.
[14:18.030 --> 14:21.110]  It's like watching a historical record and it's almost always surprising.
[14:21.270 --> 14:22.210]  I don't avoid stuff either.
[14:23.050 --> 14:24.090]  Yeah, it's not about avoiding it.
[14:24.150 --> 14:26.950]  I'm just saying if you have fond memories of it, why tarnish that?
[14:27.010 --> 14:30.510]  I don't think you're getting anything out of rewatching Bachelor Party.
[14:30.950 --> 14:33.790]  So if you have a fondness of that memory, just leave it as is.
[14:34.270 --> 14:35.030]  Don't revisit it.
[14:35.210 --> 14:39.090]  You don't need to remember that they crashed a bus into a movie theater.
[14:39.250 --> 14:40.990]  The final act for a 3D game.
[14:41.090 --> 14:42.010]  Like that doesn't...
[14:42.010 --> 14:42.850]  You're fine. You're good.
[14:42.850 --> 14:44.230]  Just move on.
[14:44.290 --> 14:45.770]  But you've been doing a lot of movie reviews.
[14:45.930 --> 14:48.990]  So I figured you'd also be a great detective on this case, Geoff.
[14:49.050 --> 14:54.950]  If you happen to see a film, I'd say between the years 2004 and 2010,
[14:55.530 --> 14:57.830]  that features a Pat Gavindale sign, let me know.
[14:58.070 --> 15:01.190]  Well, Andrew, I wish you would have brought this to my attention two weeks ago.
[15:01.390 --> 15:03.870]  I did my last movie review last episode.
[15:04.410 --> 15:05.730]  Two episodes ago.
[15:06.250 --> 15:09.570]  I haven't watched a movie since.
[15:09.570 --> 15:14.170]  Well, yeah, what's the point of watching movies if I'm not going to do reviews of them?
[15:16.150 --> 15:17.910]  I will, though. I will, though.
[15:18.030 --> 15:21.250]  I'm not interested, and to your point about going back and watching Bachelor Party,
[15:21.490 --> 15:25.890]  I've decided I don't want to spend much of my current life
[15:26.390 --> 15:30.610]  watching, like, revisiting shit that I enjoyed in the past anyway.
[15:30.990 --> 15:34.970]  Because, like, I'm discovering through this period of time in music
[15:34.970 --> 15:37.950]  where I'm discovering all these bands that were really good
[15:37.950 --> 15:42.190]  when I was really into music, but I just missed them for whatever reason.
[15:42.490 --> 15:44.450]  That there's so much stuff out there that I just haven't seen yet.
[15:44.450 --> 15:45.110]  2022, you mean?
[15:45.910 --> 15:50.930]  2022 is when I started to realize all the music from, like, 98 to, like, 2010 I missed.
[15:51.830 --> 15:56.010]  When I was really into music and going to shows, like, four days a week and going constantly...
[15:56.010 --> 15:56.530]  You're a music guy.
[15:57.090 --> 15:57.690]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:58.070 --> 15:58.610]  It's a great year.
[15:59.230 --> 15:59.970]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[16:01.630 --> 16:03.870]  I get your point.
[16:06.630 --> 16:11.490]  Anyway, and so I'm making a concerted effort to, like, to be okay with looking backward.
[16:12.090 --> 16:15.190]  I guess Condor Man would be an exception because I had already seen that, but that's for content.
[16:15.470 --> 16:18.650]  I'm okay with looking backward and watching old stuff, but only old stuff I'd never seen before.
[16:19.210 --> 16:19.570]  Interesting.
[16:20.050 --> 16:22.070]  Yeah, and I've been really enjoying it.
[16:22.110 --> 16:27.050]  I mean, that's kind of why I watched that, well, that's kind of why I watched that old Polish movie.
[16:27.430 --> 16:31.490]  I've been, up until I quit doing reviews, I've been watching a lot of movies on Criterion Collection
[16:31.490 --> 16:34.670]  that I had meant to see and never got around to it. It's been a lot of fun.
[16:35.750 --> 16:36.450]  That's great.
[16:36.890 --> 16:38.910]  I've got a movie thing. I talked to Andrew about this.
[16:39.250 --> 16:39.450]  Okay.
[16:39.850 --> 16:42.990]  I'm going to put this in Slack. Have you seen The Bourne Identity?
[16:43.390 --> 16:43.670]  Yes.
[16:44.050 --> 16:48.250]  Okay, there's this scene. Everyone should watch that. It's a 20-second clip.
[16:48.810 --> 16:56.150]  It's a nice, really long shot. It's an introductory shot. He's just about to crack on being Bourne and walking down the street.
[16:56.530 --> 16:58.050]  Doesn't this have Run Lola Run in it?
[16:58.330 --> 16:58.670]  Yes.
[16:59.210 --> 17:02.610]  Bam! See that? Nice little touch. See that, Geoff?
[17:02.830 --> 17:03.370]  What? No.
[17:03.670 --> 17:04.090]  He vanished.
[17:04.210 --> 17:04.650]  I didn't see it.
[17:04.910 --> 17:05.330]  He vanished.
[17:06.010 --> 17:06.370]  Oh!
[17:07.610 --> 17:10.570]  Now, I thought, watching that, oh, that's a nice touch. You know, he's like a ghost.
[17:11.310 --> 17:12.030]  Oh, shit!
[17:12.330 --> 17:19.050]  He's like a little ghost. He can vanish on demand. And I thought, I wonder how they did that. Did they hide a wipe behind that man?
[17:19.430 --> 17:25.170]  And then I looked closer. He just ducks and runs behind the little truck that goes behind him.
[17:25.890 --> 17:27.070]  Have a little zoom in on that.
[17:27.610 --> 17:30.230]  You can actually see him running behind it.
[17:30.250 --> 17:31.310]  All right, I'm looking now.
[17:33.670 --> 17:35.090]  Fucking... look at that dirty jacket.
[17:37.730 --> 17:39.090]  I'm going to watch for feet.
[17:40.010 --> 17:44.070]  No, don't watch for feet. I feel like it's the hardest. Just look at the cart.
[17:45.930 --> 17:46.690]  Yeah, you're right.
[17:46.930 --> 17:51.410]  So then I thought, well, I bet that's, you know, that's just how they did that effect.
[17:51.410 --> 17:58.630]  But then I thought, what if that is canon? What if that isn't Matt Damon hiding? What if Jason Bourne, as the character, decided to do that?
[17:59.030 --> 18:02.950]  And then I was in just a weird thought loop of like, who's doing that?
[18:04.530 --> 18:08.270]  The actor or the character? Because I love the idea of Jason Bourne.
[18:08.830 --> 18:14.090]  Well, I think it has to be in character, right? And I've been thinking about this. You brought this up like weeks ago.
[18:14.090 --> 18:22.630]  I continuously think about it. I think this is almost like a dark display of how paranoid Jason Bourne is as a person.
[18:22.870 --> 18:25.210]  That he feels he needs to live his life this way.
[18:25.330 --> 18:25.810]  He's thinking...
[18:25.810 --> 18:31.730]  That he's just walking down a street and that there might be somebody who's trying to tail him and he just randomly hops behind a cart for no reason.
[18:31.750 --> 18:39.350]  But he must assume that the person tailing him is exactly where the camera is. Because to everyone else, he must look like a complete freak.
[18:40.290 --> 18:42.990]  That's how heightened his senses are. He can even sense the camera.
[18:42.990 --> 18:43.990]  Yeah.
[18:44.110 --> 18:53.930]  If you think about it, it's kind of a dark revelation on what hell it must be like to be a high-value government assassin.
[18:55.270 --> 19:01.250]  He's gotta live his life that way constantly. Watching Jason Bourne on a Wednesday go to the grocery store and come home...
[19:01.250 --> 19:09.890]  He probably has to take three buses, two taxis, four cars. He probably has two decoy bags of groceries. It's gotta be a nightmare to live that way.
[19:09.890 --> 19:16.690]  Do you think it would be a nightmare to be Jason Bourne's friend? You know, like when you guys all went to the grocery store to buy your smallest item.
[19:16.790 --> 19:19.750]  Just how frustrated you would be if one of you just kept disappearing.
[19:19.970 --> 19:24.290]  Or you'd be talking to him in the living room and then suddenly he's the lamp and you're just looking around.
[19:26.310 --> 19:28.350]  He's doing ninja rolls down the aisles.
[19:31.030 --> 19:36.050]  Yeah, I think it would also suck to be Jason Bourne's friends because you're the first person they're gonna kill.
[19:36.650 --> 19:38.230]  They come for the friends and family.
[19:38.910 --> 19:43.050]  You're gonna be tied up. You're tied up in a fucking warehouse somewhere in Eastern Europe.
[19:43.310 --> 19:47.470]  And they're like electrocuting your balls and sending him a video and he gets there.
[19:47.790 --> 19:53.090]  Maybe he saves your life, but you still got your balls electrocuted for like 16 hours while he was flying in.
[19:53.530 --> 19:57.670]  I don't think any of that happened across any of the five films.
[19:58.350 --> 20:01.890]  The Jason Bourne universe is much larger than those five films.
[20:02.450 --> 20:03.170]  That's true.
[20:03.730 --> 20:05.170]  Yeah, I've read some of the books.
[20:05.710 --> 20:06.870]  I've only seen three films.
[20:07.770 --> 20:09.930]  Well, they did the original trilogy.
[20:10.110 --> 20:10.810]  I think that's what I said.
[20:10.810 --> 20:12.550]  Then there's the Jeremy Renner one.
[20:13.270 --> 20:16.550]  And then they brought Matt Damon back for another one, but I didn't see that one.
[20:16.730 --> 20:19.890]  Yeah, they did that Mission Impossible style thing where they're like, you know what?
[20:19.910 --> 20:22.230]  We're gonna turn Mission Impossible over to Jeremy Renner.
[20:22.550 --> 20:25.230]  Except they did it for one movie and said, you know what? We're gonna give it back to Matt Damon.
[20:26.490 --> 20:29.650]  And they did the confusing thing Nick just put in the chat, Jason Bourne.
[20:29.750 --> 20:32.990]  That's what they called the last entry of the film is just Jason Bourne.
[20:32.990 --> 20:36.150]  So the last one is Jason Bourne and then the Bourne Identity.
[20:36.190 --> 20:38.190]  It's terrible. It's a terrible naming convention.
[20:38.590 --> 20:40.450]  Huh, I gotta see that one. Is that any good?
[20:41.210 --> 20:44.990]  I don't think so. It was critically liked. I think it kind of flopped.
[20:45.030 --> 20:49.510]  The original trilogy, I feel like I enjoy him more every time I see him.
[20:49.710 --> 20:51.270]  I feel like I didn't like him as much as a kid.
[20:51.590 --> 20:55.790]  Really? I remember watching Bourne Identity in theaters and loving it.
[20:56.050 --> 20:58.550]  Didn't really care for the second one, liked the third one quite a bit.
[20:58.990 --> 20:59.570]  Third one's great.
[20:59.570 --> 21:03.690]  I guess I can't go back and watch them or that would be betraying that whole fucking spiel I had earlier.
[21:03.890 --> 21:07.110]  But I remember really enjoying the first... I never saw 4 and 5, but the first...
[21:07.110 --> 21:12.190]  I want to watch them again and just look out for Jason Bourne hiding behind shit and appearing out of nowhere.
[21:13.450 --> 21:15.510]  Well, there aren't many of those scenes, right?
[21:15.570 --> 21:20.670]  Like that's maybe the only moment in the series where he tries to out-sneak you, the audience member.
[21:20.850 --> 21:21.070]  Yeah.
[21:21.630 --> 21:25.970]  I love that that's there and that you can see that and you can draw that hilarious conclusion yourself.
[21:25.970 --> 21:34.190]  Because it really is ridiculous every time you see a movie and somebody stands behind a bus and the bus goes by and then they're gone in a puff of smoke like they're fucking Batman.
[21:34.210 --> 21:35.490]  And you never see them just running.
[21:35.610 --> 21:40.870]  With a grappling hook, yeah. Or when you do see them running, it's a huge comedic moment, but you know what I mean?
[21:40.990 --> 21:44.870]  Yeah. That's a great point. You never see it from their perspective.
[21:45.290 --> 21:45.450]  Yeah.
[21:45.650 --> 21:52.050]  It's always from the person who's like, oh my god, where did they go? You never... we've never seen a character do that. Until now.
[21:52.050 --> 21:52.450]  Yeah.
[21:52.530 --> 21:58.410]  Yeah, we need more of that. And I feel like nowadays they would just CG that out, fix it, or do some sort of visual effect.
[21:58.550 --> 22:03.110]  I'm glad they left that in. I'm glad it was all done optically.
[22:03.490 --> 22:03.670]  Yeah.
[22:04.370 --> 22:11.090]  Because what really happens, right, is like the bus goes by and you just start fucking booking it, running with the bus till you see like an alley you can turn into.
[22:11.310 --> 22:14.690]  And then you gotta stand in an alley and catch your breath for 15 minutes, wheezing.
[22:18.050 --> 22:21.710]  And meanwhile, the guy on the other side of the bus is like, the motherfucker vanished.
[22:24.750 --> 22:26.370]  Do you think you could naturally do that?
[22:26.950 --> 22:28.370]  I think I'd be terrible at that.
[22:28.470 --> 22:28.870]  I could do it.
[22:28.870 --> 22:31.730]  I don't think I'd be good at that at all. I think I'd be bad at the timing of the vehicle.
[22:32.050 --> 22:32.610]  I'd do the shit out of it.
[22:32.630 --> 22:33.690]  I don't think I could do that in real life.
[22:34.510 --> 22:34.670]  Yeah.
[22:35.390 --> 22:36.250]  Gavin, you could do it too, right?
[22:37.270 --> 22:39.310]  I'd give it a damn good go. We should try it.
[22:39.810 --> 22:40.210]  We should.
[22:40.770 --> 22:44.530]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, that's the next face video live video.
[22:44.670 --> 22:48.910]  We do like put the six foot hole on hold and put throwing fruit on hold.
[22:49.230 --> 22:52.310]  Let's fucking try to escape each other and film it in public.
[22:52.470 --> 22:54.530]  We'll just put one camera on one side of the street.
[22:54.650 --> 22:57.170]  The other person stands on the other side on the street with buses.
[22:59.310 --> 23:03.510]  I would love to see that from the perspective of the people on the bus.
[23:04.390 --> 23:06.770]  We put Nick on the bus with a camera.
[23:09.050 --> 23:16.270]  Do you do you think someone could do that with Sloppy Joe's like you're watching and then like they hide behind the car as it drives?
[23:16.570 --> 23:20.310]  Like it would happen like, yeah, only don't get run over there.
[23:20.530 --> 23:22.770]  No, I don't get run over, please, guys.
[23:23.610 --> 23:25.190]  I'm glad you brought it up, Eric.
[23:25.270 --> 23:28.150]  We got a we got a fucking Sloppy Joe's conundrum.
[23:28.310 --> 23:29.310]  What do you mean? Hang on.
[23:29.370 --> 23:29.890]  Hey, wait, wait, wait.
[23:29.890 --> 23:33.570]  Before you get into a conundrum, we have we're supposed to get together tomorrow and do a Sloppy Joe's bingo.
[23:34.110 --> 23:35.690]  Yeah, that's why I want to talk to you guys about that.
[23:35.690 --> 23:38.990]  I would love to get together and do Sloppy Joe's bingo tomorrow night.
[23:39.050 --> 23:41.030]  It sounds like we're not doing it.
[23:41.170 --> 23:50.030]  However, after our episode came out yesterday and it hit the public, Sloppy Joe's webcam went down and it is still down.
[23:50.450 --> 23:54.250]  No, it's been down since four.
[23:54.310 --> 23:55.350]  It's been down since four.
[23:55.550 --> 23:56.930]  Fourteen p.m. yesterday.
[23:57.910 --> 24:00.570]  No, we're approaching 24 hours.
[24:00.710 --> 24:03.450]  So I don't know that there will be a camera for us to watch.
[24:03.450 --> 24:06.610]  If you go to it, it's just black, just like the last time.
[24:06.870 --> 24:13.610]  And the inside camera, if you go to that one, it just says this camera has been, this feed has been removed for breaking terms of service.
[24:13.930 --> 24:18.030]  Maybe it's because they're playing live music, cover bands or something, I don't know.
[24:18.290 --> 24:18.370]  No way!
[24:18.690 --> 24:21.550]  But the outside camera is cut just like it was last time.
[24:21.810 --> 24:29.790]  And the other camera, so I didn't get into this with you guys, but I found another bar called Rick's Entertainment Center.
[24:29.790 --> 24:32.090]  Get real!
[24:32.690 --> 24:34.230]  What are you talking about?
[24:34.450 --> 24:37.250]  I found another bar named Rick's that has another live cam.
[24:37.370 --> 24:40.530]  It's not as good because there's no audio.
[24:41.270 --> 24:47.450]  But the Rick, I figured out and triangulated it and realized that when you're looking at the Sloppy Joe's cam,
[24:48.050 --> 24:54.070]  across the street where the puke trash can is and where sometimes Rocky stands to take photos of people,
[24:54.070 --> 25:00.110]  there is a building with a black awning and under it there's a picture that says shades, right?
[25:01.070 --> 25:05.930]  On the Rick's cam, there's a suspicious looking black awning at the far right of his cam.
[25:06.790 --> 25:12.690]  And I matched it and we brought up two cameras at once to watch cars go back and forth.
[25:12.970 --> 25:16.370]  It is literally, immediately to the left, it's the same awning.
[25:16.490 --> 25:23.890]  So the Rick's cam catches the left side of Sloppy Joe's that we don't see, albeit with no audio and from a top-down perspective.
[25:23.890 --> 25:24.950]  So it's fucking useless.
[25:25.610 --> 25:30.970]  But the cameras are located, the cameras are both located on the same building.
[25:31.170 --> 25:34.410]  That camera is located above the other one on Sloppy Joe's.
[25:34.550 --> 25:35.870]  Yeah, I'm saying it's not fun to watch.
[25:36.770 --> 25:39.190]  But that camera, I'm trying to get the idea.
[25:39.430 --> 25:41.770]  I don't understand, Geoff. What are you talking about?
[25:42.070 --> 25:43.490]  That camera is down too.
[25:44.190 --> 25:45.270]  What? Hang on.
[25:45.410 --> 25:46.930]  Why do we do this?
[25:47.050 --> 25:48.310]  What are you talking about?
[25:48.350 --> 25:51.090]  So I'm saying it's a large conspiracy.
[25:51.830 --> 25:51.870]  Why?
[25:51.870 --> 25:52.850]  Every day.
[25:54.090 --> 25:54.890]  Get real.
[25:55.350 --> 26:00.910]  I'm just telling you guys that I found a second camera that's located immediately to the left of Sloppy Joe's that's also down.
[26:01.070 --> 26:01.630]  That's all I'm saying.
[26:02.190 --> 26:05.650]  Okay, well that's... you pitched that in a way of as an alternative.
[26:05.890 --> 26:06.990]  No, no, there's no alternative.
[26:07.230 --> 26:09.470]  I'm like mad at you, I think.
[26:09.750 --> 26:11.130]  I never said there was an alternative.
[26:11.290 --> 26:14.870]  I'm saying through my research, I discovered another camera that's not as good.
[26:15.270 --> 26:15.870]  The way...
[26:17.010 --> 26:19.490]  I never insinuated I had a workaround.
[26:19.550 --> 26:20.250]  Hang on, hang on.
[26:20.290 --> 26:21.030]  It was implied.
[26:21.030 --> 26:24.250]  Gavin, did you feel like Geoff was giving an alternative?
[26:24.930 --> 26:28.730]  I feel like it was laid out that way, but I feel like I wasn't as disappointed as you guys.
[26:29.430 --> 26:31.350]  I'm just checking.
[26:31.570 --> 26:33.490]  I figured, you know, you were neutral.
[26:33.690 --> 26:34.850]  I wanted to see how you felt.
[26:35.150 --> 26:35.850]  I'm glad you agree.
[26:36.510 --> 26:42.030]  You may have read some of my enthusiasm at being able to fill out the Sloppy Joe's world a little bit more.
[26:42.030 --> 26:51.630]  Now, like when you see police sirens off to the left and you don't know what it is, you can go to that other camera and you can't hear it, but you can at least...
[26:51.630 --> 26:54.150]  Hang on, the other camera that's also down?
[26:54.970 --> 26:55.790]  When they're up.
[26:56.890 --> 26:59.690]  Goddamn, Gavin, is it me or are they being obtuse to be obtuse?
[26:59.750 --> 27:03.770]  I'm just saying, you're presenting this like this is something you can do and we can't.
[27:04.430 --> 27:05.350]  I didn't say anything.
[27:05.570 --> 27:06.670]  Don't lump me in with that.
[27:06.670 --> 27:14.790]  I'm sorry that for the last 18 hours it's been down, but for the previous five months it was an accessible thing that we've all been talking about and watching it.
[27:14.970 --> 27:17.210]  I assume it'll go up again in the fucking future.
[27:17.830 --> 27:18.270]  Goddamn!
[27:18.590 --> 27:19.890]  Okay, apology accepted.
[27:20.350 --> 27:20.950]  Thank you.
[27:21.770 --> 27:23.630]  I was laughing to myself.
[27:23.830 --> 27:28.950]  Geoff has just created a world in which he is Gene Hackman and enemy of the state through YouTube.
[27:28.990 --> 27:29.910]  I'm fucking trying to!
[27:30.130 --> 27:31.250]  All the cameras are down.
[27:31.570 --> 27:32.850]  All the cameras are down.
[27:33.150 --> 27:33.870]  What's on this street?
[27:34.190 --> 27:35.910]  You're mapping out the whole street.
[27:35.910 --> 27:41.330]  I'll tell you this, if Andrew and Eric are going to be snippy little bitches about it, I'm not going to share my fucking knowledge anymore.
[27:41.950 --> 27:44.530]  Gene Hackman's going to keep all of his data to himself.
[27:46.810 --> 27:48.070]  Nobody's being snippy.
[27:49.970 --> 27:53.090]  Gavin doesn't want to get embroiled in this fight, but he is on my side, I guarantee you.
[27:53.750 --> 27:59.910]  I think I am, and I usually end up on the opposite side to you, Geoff, just because I feel like, well, that's content.
[28:00.650 --> 28:02.030]  That's the funniest way to do it.
[28:02.030 --> 28:03.710]  That's what we do, but I really agree with you on this.
[28:04.210 --> 28:04.650]  Thank you, buddy.
[28:04.650 --> 28:08.490]  What if we just get someone to stand there and livestream it?
[28:16.150 --> 28:18.130]  Anyway, I'll keep you guys posted.
[28:18.690 --> 28:27.690]  I didn't want to give you this information before the podcast because I wanted to hear the full reaction in the moment, but if it doesn't come back up, then obviously we can't do it tomorrow night.
[28:28.150 --> 28:29.530]  I can't believe...
[28:29.530 --> 28:30.610]  Do you think you did that?
[28:31.090 --> 28:33.690]  I think it's got to be in relation to the traffic they got.
[28:33.690 --> 28:38.730]  Well, we already saw people strolling into the frame and shouting out f***face, which is awesome.
[28:39.070 --> 28:44.190]  And we saw people shouting out f***face and then talking to the bouncers about it, which I'm sure didn't help.
[28:47.070 --> 28:53.890]  I love the idea that they saw a spike in traffic and just assumed something horrible happened and have pulled all the feeds.
[28:54.010 --> 29:00.190]  They're like, we don't know what this... we don't know why this happened, but something happened and it probably isn't good because we're sloppy joes.
[29:00.530 --> 29:01.950]  Nothing great happens outside.
[29:05.110 --> 29:06.950]  I'm sorry, Geoff, that you've lost your feeds.
[29:07.410 --> 29:08.070]  It's a bummer.
[29:08.230 --> 29:11.490]  But I'm glad that, you know, hey, this has led you to mapping out the street.
[29:11.810 --> 29:16.010]  Yeah, I mean, I've done a little bit of work, so I'm just trying to fill out that world so I can see more angles and stuff.
[29:16.290 --> 29:20.410]  But it last night was definitely a hollow night without my sloppy joes to watch.
[29:20.450 --> 29:22.990]  I'll be honest with you. Survivor was good, though.
[29:23.450 --> 29:24.110]  I have a question.
[29:25.010 --> 29:25.730]  Oh, are you a tour survivor?
[29:26.310 --> 29:26.530]  No.
[29:26.830 --> 29:28.690]  No, it's fine. It's good. You should catch up.
[29:28.850 --> 29:29.430]  It's real good.
[29:29.930 --> 29:30.930]  I have a question for Eric.
[29:32.550 --> 29:32.990]  Okay.
[29:33.370 --> 29:34.050]  What's going on?
[29:34.850 --> 29:35.850]  About with what?
[29:37.890 --> 29:41.330]  You just seem like you're spiraling.
[29:42.450 --> 29:44.110]  There's just a lot happening.
[29:44.850 --> 29:47.610]  It's been, you know how people are like, oh man, it's like a long day.
[29:48.010 --> 29:50.210]  I've just been having a long life.
[29:50.790 --> 29:51.570]  A pretty long life?
[29:51.770 --> 29:52.990]  Yeah, it's just been a long life.
[29:53.070 --> 29:54.010]  That's what most people want.
[29:54.370 --> 29:54.710]  Yeah.
[29:56.210 --> 29:57.650]  Yeah, that's what they do.
[29:57.950 --> 29:58.730]  Here's the thing.
[29:59.230 --> 30:02.530]  Here's something that I never really considered when I was younger.
[30:03.770 --> 30:06.710]  I always figured I'd be dead by 35, so now I'm 36.
[30:07.390 --> 30:10.070]  And this is just sort of like, now I don't know what to do.
[30:11.710 --> 30:15.710]  And so it's just, you know, I'm cruising, I'm doing good.
[30:16.030 --> 30:18.250]  But there's just a lot of stuff that comes up.
[30:18.370 --> 30:20.770]  There's a lot of things happening in and out of work.
[30:20.870 --> 30:22.150]  There's just a lot of stuff happening.
[30:22.570 --> 30:23.170]  How can we help?
[30:23.870 --> 30:27.330]  You know, you've been doing a good job of reminding me and saying like,
[30:27.330 --> 30:29.930]  Hey, here's this thing, what happened with this thing.
[30:30.150 --> 30:31.290]  That helps a lot.
[30:31.710 --> 30:32.830]  You took a best of f*** face?
[30:33.090 --> 30:34.730]  Yeah, but it's up now.
[30:35.170 --> 30:36.130]  That helped a lot.
[30:36.290 --> 30:36.930]  Thank you very much.
[30:38.150 --> 30:38.910]  Y'all did a great job.
[30:39.010 --> 30:43.410]  And there was a note that was missed on an episode of something.
[30:43.590 --> 30:46.150]  And so that was the thing that I had to drill down on.
[30:46.270 --> 30:48.570]  There's just a lot, you know, there's a lot happening.
[30:48.830 --> 30:51.150]  Now, I don't think you have to put the audio of it out also.
[30:51.310 --> 30:52.330]  Like, it's in the episode, Nick.
[30:52.390 --> 30:52.870]  It's up to you.
[30:53.050 --> 30:55.830]  But there's just a lot, you know, going on.
[30:55.830 --> 30:57.850]  There's a lot that I'm taking care of.
[30:58.050 --> 30:59.410]  And not, you know, in and out of work.
[30:59.490 --> 31:00.230]  And it is what it is.
[31:00.570 --> 31:02.470]  But, hey, c'est la vie.
[31:02.770 --> 31:03.490]  It is what it is.
[31:03.930 --> 31:08.130]  Would it help if we, like, delivered casseroles to your house or something?
[31:09.070 --> 31:10.830]  No, I'm not in bereavement.
[31:11.850 --> 31:12.190]  So...
[31:12.190 --> 31:14.350]  Is there a card, you know, that's like, you know, it's a boy.
[31:14.590 --> 31:16.810]  Sorry for your loss or get well soon.
[31:16.910 --> 31:20.050]  Is there a sorry that you're alive?
[31:22.050 --> 31:23.750]  Sorry about your long life.
[31:24.590 --> 31:26.530]  Sorry that you're off the map now.
[31:27.290 --> 31:28.370]  Here's to the end.
[31:28.490 --> 31:30.050]  Hope it comes soon sort of card.
[31:31.830 --> 31:34.170]  Sorry about your life.
[31:36.950 --> 31:37.990]  You succeeded.
[31:38.130 --> 31:38.910]  My condolences.
[31:39.670 --> 31:40.950]  I googled it.
[31:41.290 --> 31:42.070]  I googled it.
[31:43.750 --> 31:44.590]  That's perfect.
[31:46.190 --> 31:48.310]  That's an amazing card.
[31:48.750 --> 31:49.610]  Oh, that's great.
[31:49.870 --> 31:50.890]  That's pretty good.
[31:51.250 --> 31:53.370]  I wonder if we can do our own take on that.
[31:53.370 --> 31:55.290]  And sell a nice gift card.
[31:55.510 --> 31:56.250]  That's a good idea.
[31:56.590 --> 31:57.210]  Like, just sorry.
[31:58.090 --> 32:00.950]  Because it's not even like sorry you're having a hard time.
[32:01.030 --> 32:03.090]  It's not that I'm necessarily having a hard time.
[32:03.350 --> 32:08.410]  It's just that, you know, every day I wake up...
[32:08.410 --> 32:14.570]  There's a kids in the hall sketch that starts with Bruce McCulloch saying,
[32:14.690 --> 32:17.390]  Every day I wake up, people give me shit.
[32:17.650 --> 32:19.870]  And that's how I know my day's begun.
[32:19.870 --> 32:23.270]  And that's how it feels.
[32:23.630 --> 32:25.930]  Truly, that's how it feels.
[32:26.330 --> 32:28.150]  It's just like...
[32:28.150 --> 32:31.090]  Well, why don't we... I can definitely give you less shit.
[32:31.870 --> 32:33.670]  No, no, no. You guys are fine.
[32:33.930 --> 32:37.530]  But why don't you let us know when there's less shit on your table.
[32:37.610 --> 32:39.370]  And we can then just go back to normal.
[32:39.790 --> 32:42.850]  Hopefully in the next month, there will be less shit.
[32:43.250 --> 32:47.150]  I like the idea of you noticing that your life is less shitty.
[32:47.310 --> 32:49.530]  And then being like, all right, feel free to make it shittier.
[32:49.530 --> 32:52.710]  All right, guys. I'm back. Give it to me.
[32:52.990 --> 32:55.230]  I've got some shit bandwidth. Hit me.
[32:56.810 --> 33:00.450]  It's just that thing. And I think it's a thing that people deal with in general.
[33:00.590 --> 33:04.290]  You know how you have, Gavin, like you'll suddenly have just like...
[33:04.750 --> 33:08.490]  Weak stretches where you're like, what? Like, where am I?
[33:08.610 --> 33:11.830]  What am I supposed to be on top of? What am I missing?
[33:11.930 --> 33:14.710]  Like, there's stuff that you feel like you're dropping the ball on.
[33:14.770 --> 33:17.170]  But it's not like you're necessarily dropping the ball on anything.
[33:17.170 --> 33:20.890]  There's just so many things from so many different avenues.
[33:21.350 --> 33:25.170]  I get so frustrated when I have free time, like days of free time.
[33:25.250 --> 33:27.230]  And then everything lands at the same time.
[33:27.330 --> 33:29.830]  So I'm like, I seem way busier than I am.
[33:29.870 --> 33:32.870]  And then I'm just like exhausted. Everything's stacking up.
[33:32.910 --> 33:35.070]  And then I have more free days afterwards.
[33:35.170 --> 33:38.510]  And because I've been so busy, I have no idea what to do with my free days.
[33:38.530 --> 33:40.990]  Because I feel like, oh, some of it should be spread out.
[33:41.030 --> 33:44.930]  But it's all happened. And it's a very odd way of going through life, I think.
[33:44.930 --> 33:45.390]  Yeah.
[33:46.170 --> 33:46.890]  Text me.
[33:48.370 --> 33:48.850]  Yeah.
[33:49.110 --> 33:50.750]  Oh, text. Yeah, we'll text Geoff.
[33:50.950 --> 33:52.050]  We'll go to lunch or something.
[33:52.630 --> 33:57.030]  The thing that I get, and the thing I always point out to my small wife is that
[33:57.030 --> 34:01.930]  it will be, like what you're saying happens to me in increments.
[34:01.990 --> 34:08.270]  Where there will be hours spans where I have nothing and I can sit and be, and it's fantastic.
[34:08.790 --> 34:14.090]  But the moment I have something in my hands, like I'm doing something physically
[34:14.090 --> 34:22.110]  that I need to pay attention to, I get every text message, every email, and every Slack conversation all at once.
[34:22.590 --> 34:27.250]  And it's like, where was this an hour ago when I had the time to deal with it?
[34:27.490 --> 34:32.710]  Why is it all in one four-minute span?
[34:32.890 --> 34:35.310]  It makes me crazy. It makes me so crazy.
[34:36.370 --> 34:37.170]  I hate it.
[34:38.770 --> 34:39.990]  That should be a feature.
[34:40.030 --> 34:46.910]  Here's the thing. When Geoff was sending all of our, like, here's all these Sloppy Joe's things,
[34:47.370 --> 34:51.270]  and all this stuff, it was in the middle of dealing with so much other stuff,
[34:51.430 --> 34:57.570]  and my phone was relentlessly getting just videos of, hey, look at this guy fall down.
[34:59.350 --> 35:02.350]  Yeah, but that's not important. You can just mute the conversation.
[35:02.550 --> 35:06.070]  But that's the thing. I have to do that, but it's not just you.
[35:06.070 --> 35:09.130]  Because if it was just you, it would be fine.
[35:09.370 --> 35:15.590]  It's you, and the four other group texts, and the four other Slack conversations, and the two emails,
[35:15.850 --> 35:20.510]  and it's just like, oh, what, like, you just kind of have to, like, put it down and be like,
[35:20.590 --> 35:23.190]  I don't know what I'm going to do, and then you have to figure it out from there.
[35:23.530 --> 35:29.570]  There should be a feature on the telephone where, unless a message is marked as urgent,
[35:30.010 --> 35:32.110]  it doesn't come to you when it was sent.
[35:32.110 --> 35:36.930]  If you've just received a text in the last half an hour, and it's not a part of that conversation,
[35:37.110 --> 35:41.270]  it should give it to you in half an hour. And then everything's, like, conveyor belted out to you,
[35:41.370 --> 35:43.590]  and there's no, like, stacking of bullshit.
[35:44.070 --> 35:47.990]  It'd be cool if you could, like, anything marked as non-emergency, you could just say, like,
[35:48.050 --> 35:51.010]  all right, I want all my texts to show up 15 minutes after the hour.
[35:51.170 --> 35:55.950]  And then you just get a rush of them in that 15, you have 45, you have an hour before the next batch.
[35:56.030 --> 35:56.290]  You'd stall it.
[35:57.070 --> 35:59.810]  Sounds like working out with, like, rest periods and shit.
[36:01.390 --> 36:03.930]  Doing high-intensity training, but for texts.
[36:04.390 --> 36:05.610]  High-intensity texting.
[36:06.190 --> 36:13.050]  Eric, I sympathize with you, and I've been there, but I'm never gonna stop texting you funny stuff.
[36:13.050 --> 36:15.890]  No, no, no, and I'm not asking you to, if it was...
[36:15.890 --> 36:20.610]  See, here's the thing, like, with this show, it's never gonna be a thing where it bothers me.
[36:20.750 --> 36:24.950]  It's just that this is something that is important to me and I care about.
[36:24.950 --> 36:29.030]  Like, so, part of this, so people are listening, we were supposed to be throwing fruit,
[36:29.150 --> 36:30.890]  and Geoff is supposed to get a baseline for the throwing stuff,
[36:31.090 --> 36:34.890]  but I've had so much, and I've just been dealing with a lot of stuff this week,
[36:34.930 --> 36:37.870]  that I couldn't put it together in time, and I didn't want to do it half-ass,
[36:37.910 --> 36:40.490]  I wanted to make sure that we do it and we're into it and everything.
[36:41.710 --> 36:44.770]  If it ever becomes overwhelming with this show, I'll talk to you guys.
[36:44.910 --> 36:48.510]  But I never do, because this is the thing that I want to put time and energy into.
[36:48.750 --> 36:53.170]  It's all of the other stuff that gets stacked around it and on top of it, where you go,
[36:53.170 --> 36:59.270]  oh, I'm in a living hell, and I am truly in a world of my own making, and I must live with it.
[36:59.350 --> 37:00.290]  And so it is what it is.
[37:00.750 --> 37:04.190]  Hopefully that will be getting better for you incrementally in the future, though.
[37:04.230 --> 37:05.530]  I think it will. I think it will.
[37:05.630 --> 37:05.730]  Yeah.
[37:11.100 --> 37:14.640]  This ad is brought to you by HelloFresh, America's number one meal kit.
[37:15.300 --> 37:19.240]  HelloFresh takes the hassle out of mealtime this spring by delivering pre-portioned ingredients
[37:19.240 --> 37:22.060]  and easy-to-prepare recipes right to your door.
[37:22.060 --> 37:27.360]  Skip the checkout lines and get outside in the warmer weather, because HelloFresh has dinner covered.
[37:27.860 --> 37:31.820]  April is Earth Month, and HelloFresh is always committed to a cleaner planet.
[37:32.300 --> 37:38.380]  On average, HelloFresh meals have a 31% lower carbon footprint than the same meals made from the supermarket ingredients.
[37:38.980 --> 37:45.200]  Plus, nearly all HelloFresh packaging materials are curbside recyclable in most areas of the U.S.
[37:45.500 --> 37:47.240]  Good food is too precious to waste.
[37:48.020 --> 37:54.220]  HelloFresh's pre-portioned ingredients cuts down on your food waste by at least 23% compared to grocery shopping,
[37:54.460 --> 37:56.740]  which is good for your wallet and the planet.
[37:57.840 --> 38:04.180]  HelloFresh is a great service. The food is always so good. It's fun getting the box, as I say in every ad, because it's true.
[38:04.880 --> 38:08.840]  It's delicious recipes. No matter what experience you have at cooking, I would highly recommend it.
[38:09.260 --> 38:13.220]  It's a real joy. I genuinely love getting HelloFresh. It's a great service.
[38:13.220 --> 38:22.000]  So go to hellofresh.com slash face50 and use code face50 for 50% off plus your first box ships free.

[38:32.180 --> 38:37.140]  Going online without ExpressVPN is like using your smartphone without a protective case.
[38:37.140 --> 38:42.480]  Most of the time you'll probably be fine, but all it takes is one accidental drop onto a solid concrete.
[38:42.860 --> 38:47.960]  Onto a solid concrete? I mean just solid concrete in general. I don't know why I've specified a singular piece of concrete.
[38:48.340 --> 38:51.300]  Your phone could break for all sorts of reasons on all sorts of surfaces.
[38:51.540 --> 38:54.280]  But all it takes is one time to make you wish you had protected yourself.
[38:54.900 --> 39:01.860]  Every time you connect to an unencrypted network in cafes, hotels, airports, etc, your online data is not secured.
[39:01.860 --> 39:08.120]  Any hacker on the same network can gain access to and steal your personal data, passwords, financial details, etc.
[39:08.760 --> 39:11.740]  And it doesn't take much technical knowledge to know how to hack someone.
[39:12.180 --> 39:15.880]  Just some cheap hardware is needed. A smart 12 year old could do it.
[39:16.480 --> 39:23.040]  Your data is valuable. Hackers can make up to $1000 per person selling your personal info on the dark web.
[39:23.660 --> 39:26.840]  Why should you use ExpressVPN? Because they have an encrypted tunnel.
[39:27.240 --> 39:30.420]  It creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet.
[39:30.420 --> 39:34.640]  Hackers can't steal your sensitive data. It's super secure.
[39:35.040 --> 39:40.060]  It'd take a hacker with a supercomputer over a billion years to get past ExpressVPN's encryption.
[39:40.700 --> 39:44.700]  It's easy to use. Fire up the app and click one button to get protected.
[39:45.140 --> 39:51.580]  And it works on all devices. Phones, laptops, tablets and more so you can stay secure on the go.
[39:51.700 --> 39:56.420]  I also really like using ExpressVPN to access other content libraries.
[39:57.040 --> 40:00.960]  In the past I watched The Spelling Bee every year and it was only available in America.
[40:01.080 --> 40:04.540]  But using ExpressVPN I was able to watch it. It was a lifesaver.
[40:05.180 --> 40:07.400]  It's a good service. I'd highly recommend it.
[40:07.520 --> 40:12.140]  So secure your online data today by visiting expressvpn.com slash face.
[40:12.620 --> 40:16.940]  That's e-x-p-r-e-s-s-v-p-n dot com slash face.
[40:17.300 --> 40:22.720]  And you can get an extra 3 months free at expressvpn.com slash face.
[40:24.960 --> 40:30.540]  I'm in a living hell and I'm in a world of my own making is exactly what I thought when I fell on my sushi container.
[40:30.580 --> 40:32.220]  So I can relate to that statement.
[40:32.580 --> 40:34.740]  Me and you, Andrew, we're like the same guy.
[40:35.380 --> 40:39.500]  Yeah, exactly. I had a great fall recently. I had a real embarrassing fall.
[40:39.840 --> 40:40.400]  It was not good.
[40:40.540 --> 40:40.760]  In public?
[40:42.400 --> 40:46.280]  Yeah, not intending to be in public, but in public in the worst way.
[40:46.620 --> 40:50.520]  I was hungry and it was late at night and so I ordered a little delivery.
[40:50.520 --> 40:55.420]  And I like to wait outside the door because I don't want to interact with the person.
[40:55.540 --> 40:57.280]  Avoid all social contact as much as possible.
[40:57.780 --> 40:59.000]  I wait until they leave.
[40:59.440 --> 41:07.700]  And then almost like a cartoon, if they place the bag next to the door, I will crack the door, put my hand out, grab the food, then close the door.
[41:08.200 --> 41:10.860]  Very quick. It's a very smooth move.
[41:11.100 --> 41:14.740]  But this is later at night and so I was like, I don't want to just leave it out there.
[41:14.760 --> 41:16.260]  I want to get it as quickly as possible.
[41:16.300 --> 41:18.980]  They're in their car. They probably won't notice me.
[41:18.980 --> 41:27.800]  I was a little too far away from the bag and I overextended, I overreached and I lost my balance and I fell through the door.
[41:27.940 --> 41:34.060]  Like I knocked the door open and fell through onto the front pavement area and they saw this.
[41:34.200 --> 41:35.720]  So your door opens outwards?
[41:36.020 --> 41:45.440]  It opens outwards and so I crack it, I bend to grab the thing, I'm reaching for it, realize it's too far, lose my balance, do that little thing.
[41:45.440 --> 41:48.500]  You know where you try to recover by taking steps forward?
[41:48.940 --> 41:53.560]  And by doing so I bang open the door, which is cracked open, and then I just fall.
[41:53.760 --> 42:00.940]  So this person is just about to get in their car and then they see a door swing open and me barreling out of it and falling.
[42:01.800 --> 42:04.100]  So you're like Crouch Falling.
[42:04.420 --> 42:06.460]  You're like Jason Blowing behind them.
[42:09.420 --> 42:11.120]  What are you wearing in this?
[42:11.340 --> 42:13.800]  Just like a shirt and underwear.
[42:13.800 --> 42:15.760]  Yeah, I knew you were in underwear.
[42:16.040 --> 42:17.020]  I knew you were in underwear.
[42:19.320 --> 42:24.500]  I feel like my mental image of you now is permanently like a stumbling Winnie the Pooh.
[42:24.620 --> 42:27.900]  Yeah, same. Winnie the Pooh with a gluon mustache is what I see.
[42:30.500 --> 42:35.100]  Are you okay? I'm so embarrassed. I'm fine, thanks. Have a great night. Bye.
[42:36.240 --> 42:41.780]  I ate shit. I ate shit at such a low level. You said I was crouched. It was like such a low fall.
[42:41.780 --> 42:43.980]  Was the food okay? Food was great.
[42:44.760 --> 42:47.280]  That's about as public as you seem to get, I feel like.
[42:47.340 --> 42:50.400]  Like three feet outside your front porch.
[42:53.680 --> 42:57.720]  That reminds me of a decide. Did you guys see the new F*** Face game?
[42:57.900 --> 42:59.760]  Yeah. Is somebody in her community made? No.
[43:00.240 --> 43:02.880]  That made me so happy. I'll post it. I'll post a link to it.
[43:03.720 --> 43:05.520]  Is it better than Guess Who Might Be Dead?
[43:07.800 --> 43:12.880]  You don't measure your children. They're great games in their own way.
[43:13.500 --> 43:16.620]  Cog Employee number two made this.
[43:17.420 --> 43:19.020]  How are you going to know how tall they are?
[43:20.400 --> 43:26.200]  You literally measure them. I was excited about being measured, but you don't say which one you like more or what's better.
[43:26.460 --> 43:28.440]  You don't rank your children.
[43:29.220 --> 43:30.660]  That would have been a better word.
[43:31.020 --> 43:33.960]  I've only got one kid, but I'm pretty sure all parents do that.
[43:33.960 --> 43:37.640]  Oh, definitely. But you keep it internal, my point is. You don't vocalize.
[43:37.980 --> 43:40.660]  Some families make it very obvious, like Gavin.
[43:41.640 --> 43:43.560]  Hey, I didn't want to bring it up.
[43:44.300 --> 43:47.600]  Yeah, I'm talking about how they clearly like your brother and your sister more than you.
[43:49.700 --> 43:53.800]  This person made Andrew Pants Pro Shitter. It's a Windows game.
[43:54.480 --> 43:57.540]  It's great. I haven't been able to play it yet.
[43:57.540 --> 44:02.420]  You know when I described trying to balance on the toilet seat that's broken?
[44:02.720 --> 44:03.500]  Oh, like a Tony Hawk grind?
[44:03.960 --> 44:09.540]  Yeah, like a Tony Hawk grind. It's me on a toilet seat that's sliding around and you need to keep them balanced.
[44:10.160 --> 44:14.300]  And the longer they're on the toilet, the more shits they do, I think is the scoring system.
[44:14.800 --> 44:18.240]  And if they fall off, the game ends. But it's really dumb and it's really great.
[44:18.440 --> 44:18.700]  Wow.
[44:18.800 --> 44:24.720]  Hey, that reminds me of two quick, very pertinent things to what we're talking about right now.
[44:24.720 --> 44:37.440]  The first one is, Major League Fan Jack recently, I saw him and he told me that we should make some sort of a toilet tray that you can eat and put your iPad on while you're sitting on it.
[44:37.500 --> 44:40.220]  So that you don't have to worry about spilling your cupcakes.
[44:40.700 --> 44:43.400]  And then maybe it like transforms and works in the bathtub too.
[44:43.620 --> 44:47.840]  Which I thought was a pretty good idea. A toilet food tray so you can eat dinner in peace while you're shitting.
[44:49.480 --> 44:50.920]  Something maybe you should look into.
[44:50.920 --> 44:55.640]  I don't know the layout of your toilet really, so it'd be hard for me to build.
[44:57.100 --> 45:00.380]  He uses the toilet while he's in the bathtub. You're not like eating on the shitter, are you?
[45:00.860 --> 45:01.120]  No.
[45:01.540 --> 45:09.500]  Yeah, but you could do that. You could also set it on top of the toilet so that it's like a secure, it's probably got rails around it, like a lip so nothing falls, you know?
[45:09.620 --> 45:13.800]  It's like just like a more secure place. You just pick it up, bring your food in, just set it right down on top of the toilet.
[45:14.020 --> 45:16.600]  If you gotta take a dump, you pick it up, set it on your lap.
[45:17.460 --> 45:20.500]  That way you're not putting your food directly on your toilet like he does sometimes.
[45:20.500 --> 45:30.040]  What if you had to live a week with a one-in-one-out rule? Like you had to take all of your bites on the toilet as poo was coming out.
[45:30.860 --> 45:34.960]  That's terrible. That's the worst game. That's the worst game that has been suggested on the show.
[45:34.980 --> 45:38.080]  And then you will remain the same weight constantly throughout the week.
[45:38.360 --> 45:40.100]  I don't think that's how that works.
[45:40.180 --> 45:40.480]  No?
[45:41.020 --> 45:42.080]  No, I don't think so.
[45:42.420 --> 45:47.240]  I think there might be some issues. Listen, I'm not a doctor. I'm not a scientist. I don't think that's how that works.
[45:47.240 --> 45:52.200]  So, if you're done shitting, do you have to stop eating? Like the second the last poop comes out, you gotta quit?
[45:52.220 --> 45:52.780]  Oh, this is terrible.
[45:52.800 --> 45:53.460]  I think so, yeah.
[45:54.000 --> 45:55.580]  I don't think you could eat enough.
[45:55.920 --> 45:57.620]  And you can only drink while you piss.
[45:58.200 --> 46:03.140]  I think it spirals down, right? Because I like that one, you can only drink while you piss.
[46:03.500 --> 46:07.320]  But with the food one, I don't... because you're shitting for like, what, a minute, minute and a half?
[46:07.500 --> 46:16.060]  You can only get so much food in your mouth, then you gotta stop. You're taking less in, and then you're shitting less out, which then reduces the amount of time that you can take more food in. You'll be dead in a week.
[46:16.480 --> 46:18.040]  Oh, you think you would die from that?
[46:18.660 --> 46:23.060]  I don't think you could eat... I don't... the less you eat, the less you shit, and the less you shit, the less you can eat.
[46:24.480 --> 46:27.280]  I mean, that's just math. Right there.
[46:27.800 --> 46:29.440]  I think one of us should try it.
[46:29.940 --> 46:30.340]  Not it!
[46:31.080 --> 46:31.520]  Not it!
[46:31.600 --> 46:31.960]  No!
[46:32.460 --> 46:32.820]  Oh!
[46:33.740 --> 46:35.060]  Oh, Andrew, alright.
[46:35.100 --> 46:37.480]  No, I'm the only one that's been vocally against this.
[46:38.720 --> 46:45.420]  Also, we're not six, I'm not... you're not gonna like, double dog dare me, and then I gotta do it. Like, this is... that's not how this works. I'm not doing it.
[46:45.420 --> 46:49.340]  Gavin, you seem excited about it. Gavin, have you given Geoff your toilet paper roll?
[46:49.400 --> 46:50.060]  Oh, we need to do that.
[46:50.060 --> 46:50.620]  Something I was thinking about.
[46:51.100 --> 46:52.480]  Oh, not yet. I've got it ready, though.
[46:53.060 --> 46:53.260]  Okay.
[46:53.440 --> 46:59.320]  I also need... I also... I'm waiting for Geoff to give me whatever it is that I need to send to Kevin, because I want to send your sticks.
[46:59.960 --> 47:03.140]  The next time I see you, I'll give you my thing, and then we'll work it out.
[47:03.260 --> 47:07.860]  Should we do a dead drop? Like, you have to dig up a bog roll, and then you bury what you want me to send to Andrew?
[47:08.000 --> 47:12.200]  We could... we could definitely do that. We could definitely do that. We could definitely do that.
[47:13.060 --> 47:17.740]  The other thing I wanted to mention, because it reminded me of two things. This is one of my notes.
[47:18.080 --> 47:21.220]  Andrew, could we get an update on the doorbell mystery?
[47:21.740 --> 47:26.500]  I don't have a doorbell. Like, it's before it was just the button is gone. Now everything is gone.
[47:26.640 --> 47:31.140]  But I have reported it to the building, so it is possible they took it.
[47:31.200 --> 47:38.100]  So either somebody came back and stole more of my doorbell, or the person that runs the building has taken it to replace it.
[47:39.240 --> 47:41.660]  I think it's probably the former, not the latter.
[47:42.460 --> 47:48.160]  Yeah? I mean, I hope it's the building. Although it would be funnier if somebody else just came to take more of the doorbell.
[47:49.820 --> 47:53.720]  Should you put up a decoy doorbell and see if they take it?
[47:55.660 --> 47:57.080]  I should booby trap it, right?
[47:57.400 --> 47:59.040]  Yeah, you should. It should electrocute somebody.
[47:59.240 --> 47:59.820]  Yeah, absolutely.
[48:02.720 --> 48:10.500]  Or maybe they push the doorbell, and a little blow dart comes out, and it shoots them in the side of the neck with a blow dart that makes them fall asleep, and then you can catch them in the act.
[48:10.500 --> 48:11.760]  They'll be snoozing on your front porch.
[48:13.160 --> 48:17.980]  I recently suggested something to you, Geoff, that you didn't seem to respond to. I'm disappointed by it.
[48:17.980 --> 48:18.920]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[48:20.400 --> 48:27.800]  I don't want to say it, but I think I came up with a thing that would be a funny thing against Gavin, and it didn't really go anywhere, unfortunately.
[48:28.020 --> 48:28.680]  A funny thing against Gavin?
[48:29.320 --> 48:29.620]  Yeah.
[48:30.200 --> 48:31.460]  I don't like this.
[48:31.760 --> 48:33.280]  It might still happen, so...
[48:33.280 --> 48:35.740]  I might have been in the middle of something. You'll have to remind me.
[48:35.940 --> 48:36.680]  Yeah, I'll...
[48:36.680 --> 48:38.220]  I could have been off my game or something.
[48:38.220 --> 48:42.020]  I'll send you a... you know what? I'll text you right now. It's a very short thing.
[48:42.140 --> 48:42.460]  Okay.
[48:43.100 --> 48:45.500]  And then you could react to it.
[48:45.920 --> 48:52.540]  While you're doing that, I want to post something in the chat. I have a little mystery of my own I discovered yesterday.
[48:53.660 --> 48:58.920]  Not that I was looking for a mystery, but it found me, and I was going to see what you guys think about this.
[48:58.920 --> 49:07.140]  I was sitting in my backyard doing what I do for fun now, which is listening to birds.
[49:07.520 --> 49:12.020]  I have a bird ID app on my phone, and I try to see how many different birds show up in my yard.
[49:12.020 --> 49:17.160]  Are you really running with the most boring, or at least interesting person?
[49:17.340 --> 49:24.900]  It's called the Merlin Bird ID, and then it sends all of the bird sounds that it captures to Cornell University so they can track bird migration.
[49:25.720 --> 49:28.880]  I'm getting real...
[49:30.980 --> 49:37.520]  While I was sitting in my backyard yesterday, right next to me was this.
[49:38.200 --> 49:44.280]  Well, of course it's too large. It's one fucking photo.
[49:45.780 --> 49:48.040]  Eric, you have too much on me. Please don't give me shit. Thank you.
[49:48.200 --> 49:49.140]  Don't give him shit. Don't give him shit.
[49:49.280 --> 49:55.560]  Eric, let me know when you're back, because I cannot wait to kick off about this again.
[49:56.380 --> 50:00.700]  Okay, I'm going to put it in Slack. Eric, you're off the hook.
[50:02.700 --> 50:03.100]  Goddamn.
[50:03.620 --> 50:10.540]  Here's the deal. I have a decent-sized backyard, and I have a big fence around it that is impermeable.
[50:10.620 --> 50:13.660]  You guys have seen it. There's no animals getting in or out that fence, right?
[50:15.380 --> 50:18.700]  I also have two dead dogs. They've both been dead...
[50:19.600 --> 50:22.820]  One's been dead a little over a year. The other one's been dead about eight months.
[50:23.800 --> 50:28.240]  So, imagine my surprise when I sat down to record my bird sound yesterday,
[50:28.440 --> 50:33.500]  and I see this giant log of shit right in the middle of my backyard.
[50:33.640 --> 50:36.780]  I see it as a picture. And here, I thought, oh, that's probably not going to do good.
[50:36.860 --> 50:40.880]  I took a photo of it again. Here it is next to my shoe for scale.
[50:42.320 --> 50:46.240]  It's a full-on... come on, fucking post. All right, there you go.
[50:46.520 --> 50:50.600]  It's a full-on log. Like, I've had a cat. It's way bigger than a cat turd.
[50:50.600 --> 50:53.720]  And also, cats don't just shit in the middle of the yard. They're more demure than that.
[50:54.000 --> 50:58.160]  It's bigger than, like, rabbit pellets. It's about the size of Henry's turds.
[50:58.580 --> 51:04.900]  So I want to know, here's my mystery, how did an animal with an asshole that big get in my backyard,
[51:05.200 --> 51:10.060]  which is locked down like Fort Knox, take a big dump in the middle of the yard, and then where did they go?
[51:10.700 --> 51:13.720]  Do you think it was an animal, or could it have possibly been...
[51:13.720 --> 51:17.360]  Remember when you waved that guy back who was leaving for your power? Could it have been him?
[51:17.360 --> 51:18.220]  Could he have been waiting?
[51:18.440 --> 51:23.440]  No, that's the thing. I cut the grass five days ago. So it's been within the last week.
[51:23.560 --> 51:26.220]  Nobody's been in my backyard but me and Emily in the last week.
[51:26.540 --> 51:29.780]  And I don't think it's her. I know I used to joke that she shit in the backyard.
[51:30.100 --> 51:31.920]  It's like a raccoon or a coyote or something, isn't it?
[51:32.160 --> 51:35.280]  I don't think it's... I think it's too big for a raccoon.
[51:35.820 --> 51:37.080]  How big is a possum's anus?
[51:37.360 --> 51:41.840]  We do have a possum, but my possum is about the size of a big cat.
[51:41.840 --> 51:44.880]  And I've never seen a cat that would be close to that.
[51:45.020 --> 51:49.620]  I'm telling you, that is 50 pound dog shit right there. That is Henry the Bulldog shit.
[51:50.680 --> 51:53.380]  And Emily smooshed it around a little bit. It's full of berries.
[51:53.880 --> 51:55.920]  So it's clearly a wild animal of some kind.
[51:56.260 --> 51:57.380]  She smooshed it around.
[51:57.880 --> 52:01.800]  I like where we're at, by the way. With all the brands here at Rooster Teeth,
[52:01.860 --> 52:05.760]  you've got all these amazing, expensive rebrands.
[52:06.140 --> 52:08.160]  All good, no worries. It looks amazing.
[52:08.160 --> 52:12.180]  Our podcast, we can't even post a picture of dog shit in our own chat.
[52:12.360 --> 52:14.500]  That's the difference between our products.
[52:14.760 --> 52:17.940]  Well, I mean, it's clearly not from a dog, so...
[52:17.940 --> 52:18.180]  Whatever.
[52:19.020 --> 52:20.200]  It's not dog shit.
[52:20.480 --> 52:24.380]  It's the size of dog shit. What animal shits the size of a dog?
[52:25.380 --> 52:30.400]  And listen, with the exception of domesticated dogs who will shit anywhere,
[52:30.840 --> 52:34.260]  wild animals don't tend to just shit in the open where everybody can see them.
[52:34.360 --> 52:36.180]  It puts them in a point of vulnerability.
[52:37.100 --> 52:39.760]  And cats are very good about cleaning up after themselves.
[52:39.940 --> 52:43.340]  So I just don't know who's shitting in the middle of the yard.
[52:43.480 --> 52:44.380]  It's very aggressive.
[52:45.060 --> 52:46.720]  Get one of those wildlife night vision cameras.
[52:46.960 --> 52:49.580]  Yeah, I need to. I have a backyard camera, but it didn't catch it.
[52:50.200 --> 52:53.400]  Like a security camera didn't catch it, so I'm gonna do that.
[52:53.480 --> 52:55.400]  I'm gonna get some sort of a nature camera.
[52:55.580 --> 52:58.520]  Because somebody's dropping turds in my yard.
[52:59.320 --> 53:02.940]  Is there an app that's like the Birdcall one, but for turds?
[53:04.920 --> 53:08.620]  Like a turd call app? Like you take a photo of it and it tells you what it is?
[53:08.840 --> 53:10.840]  Yeah, like what turd is it?
[53:11.320 --> 53:12.140]  It's a great idea.
[53:13.320 --> 53:17.620]  Andrew, I got your text and I'm very into your idea. I'm sorry if I didn't seem like I was.
[53:17.680 --> 53:18.720]  No, that's fine. That's fine.
[53:19.500 --> 53:21.940]  Speaking of your yard, I had this thought yesterday.
[53:22.420 --> 53:26.160]  Because you're talking about all the cars you're gonna find when you dig.
[53:26.200 --> 53:27.880]  If you dig far enough, all the different vehicles.
[53:28.720 --> 53:31.840]  I had a thought. I think you guys should do this. It makes me really happy.
[53:31.840 --> 53:35.140]  You should get a metal detector. You and Gavin should get a metal detector.
[53:35.400 --> 53:39.400]  And just go in your backyard and whatever it pings, just dig until you find whatever it is.
[53:39.700 --> 53:40.820]  See if there is a vehicle.
[53:41.300 --> 53:43.520]  I wanna find a car. I wanna find a hood.
[53:44.840 --> 53:47.600]  When we're renting the jackhammer, can we rent a metal detector too?
[53:48.460 --> 53:52.040]  That's not something that has to be done right now, Eric. We can look into that in a month.
[53:52.040 --> 53:53.280]  Just a future thing.
[53:53.940 --> 53:56.600]  Also, metal detectors are relatively cheap.
[53:56.880 --> 53:59.560]  Where do you rent a metal detector?
[53:59.560 --> 54:01.820]  Let's just buy one. How deep do they go?
[54:02.900 --> 54:06.760]  I don't know. I think you could get a shitty one that doesn't go super far.
[54:06.940 --> 54:08.520]  And an insane one, I imagine.
[54:09.320 --> 54:10.620]  I think it's probably a range.
[54:11.040 --> 54:14.340]  Oh man, speaking of difference in quality, let me ask you guys a question.
[54:15.360 --> 54:20.140]  I was shopping today. I need to buy some weed killer.
[54:20.700 --> 54:22.800]  I typically buy that at Lowe's.
[54:23.020 --> 54:24.760]  But I was at Walmart looking for cards.
[54:25.000 --> 54:28.140]  And so I just thought I'd see how much I'd check the weed killer there.
[54:28.140 --> 54:33.540]  And then I thought, I wonder if it's cheaper or more expensive here or at Lowe's.
[54:34.160 --> 54:35.780]  So I took a picture of it and then I went to Lowe's.
[54:35.840 --> 54:41.260]  And it turns out Walmart weed killer is $2 cheaper than the exact same fucking thing at Lowe's.
[54:41.460 --> 54:44.500]  I guess you're paying a $2 premium to get to shop at Lowe's and not have to shop at Walmart.
[54:44.500 --> 54:57.940]  But when I was in there, I looked and I realized that for the same one gallon container of weed killer, the prices varied from $9 to $29.
[54:58.860 --> 55:03.920]  Can there be that much of a quality difference between poison?
[55:04.720 --> 55:09.820]  Isn't the cheaper a liquor is, the more poisonous it is?
[55:10.500 --> 55:13.920]  Is cheap poison really worse than expensive poison?
[55:13.920 --> 55:16.340]  It seems like if you're going to cut costs on buying something...
[55:16.340 --> 55:17.960]  I bought the cheapest fucking poison they had.
[55:18.420 --> 55:22.220]  So should we do a comparison between top shelf poison and the cheap poison?
[55:22.800 --> 55:25.100]  And see if it kills three times as much?
[55:25.700 --> 55:28.000]  Yeah, like, how do you...
[55:28.820 --> 55:30.420]  It just seems ludicrous to me.
[55:30.500 --> 55:34.780]  I can't imagine that the $9 poison is any worse than the $29 poison.
[55:35.220 --> 55:36.820]  Geoff, you might become a poison guy.
[55:36.920 --> 55:39.800]  Because this is exactly how 50 Cent got into vitamin water.
[55:39.800 --> 55:44.620]  He noticed that there was an expensive $5 brand and then a 50 Cent brand.
[55:44.820 --> 55:47.000]  This is your same realization with poison.
[55:47.400 --> 55:52.560]  I think you need to make a premium poison product and just dominate the marketplace.
[55:52.900 --> 55:53.880]  Premium poison product.
[55:54.180 --> 55:54.380]  Yeah.
[55:55.020 --> 55:57.160]  A five star poison for your yard.
[55:57.580 --> 55:59.760]  It's like how the guy made Grey Goose Vodka successful.
[56:00.100 --> 56:03.760]  He launched it in the 70s and nobody bought it so he doubled the price and suddenly everybody wanted it.
[56:03.940 --> 56:09.200]  I'm going to sell a $75 weed killer poison that's just round up in a different container.
[56:10.020 --> 56:14.060]  But it's bespoke because I'll put some like elderflower in it or something.
[56:14.500 --> 56:17.860]  Is there a maximum amount of poison that can be like...
[56:17.860 --> 56:22.640]  What's the parts per million of poison that's at the upper limit of off the shelf poison?
[56:23.120 --> 56:24.340]  We should look into that.
[56:24.920 --> 56:31.380]  Oh, that's a great... I feel like that's a branding thing of like, oh, it's too poisonous to have on shelves type thing.
[56:31.400 --> 56:32.600]  Yeah, like it's at the limit.
[56:33.000 --> 56:33.440]  Yeah.
[56:34.260 --> 56:38.840]  It's the most concentrated poison we are legally allowed to sell you.
[56:38.840 --> 56:42.020]  There has to be because they do that with energy drinks, right?
[56:42.120 --> 56:44.280]  Like there's a certain max amount of caffeine.
[56:44.440 --> 56:48.300]  There should be a certain max amount of poison in your poison products.
[56:48.560 --> 56:48.780]  Yeah.
[56:49.260 --> 56:50.480]  There has to be a line.
[56:50.740 --> 56:51.460]  There has to be a line.
[56:51.820 --> 56:53.600]  Like where do you get cyanide from?
[56:54.220 --> 56:55.040]  Like who sells that?
[56:56.220 --> 56:58.200]  Let's Google that. Who sells cyanide?
[56:59.100 --> 57:00.080]  I don't know.
[57:01.360 --> 57:05.860]  Where can I buy cyanide?
[57:05.880 --> 57:08.240]  Do you want a work computer or a home computer?
[57:10.100 --> 57:16.560]  Here's what I'm going to say. Where can I buy cyanide if my name is Eric Badour?
[57:16.800 --> 57:20.580]  Eric, there's a great podcast to get a VPN sponsor, just saying.
[57:20.720 --> 57:21.260]  No kidding.
[57:21.620 --> 57:21.920]  God.
[57:22.180 --> 57:25.900]  Use ExpressVPN and make sure that you look up your poisons.
[57:28.120 --> 57:31.160]  It's not telling me, apparently.
[57:32.420 --> 57:39.620]  It's just a lot of stuff that is like, what is the most deadly poison on the planet?
[57:40.440 --> 57:44.460]  And a lot of lists and it seems like you only really need one.
[57:45.360 --> 57:48.260]  I can't imagine it's changing very much between research.
[57:48.380 --> 57:48.840]  You know what I mean?
[57:49.240 --> 57:49.480]  Yeah.
[57:50.560 --> 57:52.020]  Hey, we should probably wrap up.
[57:52.160 --> 57:54.760]  But Gavin, I said I wanted to say something about British people today.
[57:54.820 --> 57:58.600]  I've had an observation and I wanted to...
[57:58.600 --> 58:02.640]  I spent a lot of my time, I spent a lot of our friendship making fun of you in your country.
[58:03.020 --> 58:03.180]  Yeah.
[58:03.980 --> 58:08.200]  Good-naturedly, because I love you dearly and I love going to England and I love the people.
[58:08.680 --> 58:09.480]  I really do.
[58:10.020 --> 58:13.280]  I can't... not there on the food yet, but I love the people.
[58:14.080 --> 58:17.920]  But I was watching, you know, I told you guys before about that show, The Traitors.
[58:18.980 --> 58:19.340]  Yeah.
[58:19.400 --> 58:20.060]  It was on Peacock.
[58:20.420 --> 58:23.160]  Well, there was an Australian and a UK version.
[58:23.300 --> 58:27.140]  And I watched all of the Australian version, way better than the US version, by the way.
[58:27.140 --> 58:31.540]  Watching the UK version now, which is way better than the Australian version.
[58:31.660 --> 58:33.680]  It's definitely the best version of the show.
[58:34.260 --> 58:39.460]  What I want to say, I want to congratulate British people on being in touch with their emotions.
[58:39.900 --> 58:45.100]  After watching the US and the Australian show, where people are... just reacted very differently.
[58:45.260 --> 58:51.200]  On the British show, every person on that show cries almost every episode.
[58:52.120 --> 58:57.180]  People are really in touch with their feelings and they're not scared to express it.
[58:57.300 --> 59:02.420]  As a matter of fact, early on, there was one dude who was kind of acting like a dick and somebody was crying.
[59:02.540 --> 59:06.940]  And he was yelling at them to stop crying, that they're being fake and that this is a game and there's no reason to cry.
[59:07.480 --> 59:12.380]  Literally, the next episode, that dude was broken down and wailing and sobbing.
[59:12.720 --> 59:17.780]  Everybody on that show has shown very vocally their emotions.
[59:17.780 --> 59:24.480]  So I just want to say congratulations on British people for being comfortable enough in their own skin to cry very publicly.
[59:24.780 --> 59:27.360]  That's cool. The Australians and the US people weren't doing it.
[59:27.880 --> 59:31.820]  I feel like every time you made me cry, I just ran and hid away so you couldn't see.
[59:33.140 --> 59:34.340]  Well, these people are doing it.
[59:34.880 --> 59:35.540]  Shut up.
[59:35.860 --> 59:36.920]  I never made you cry.
[59:37.400 --> 59:37.840]  No, you never did.
[59:37.860 --> 59:39.280]  I never made you fucking cry.
[59:39.440 --> 59:41.220]  Maybe tears of joy.
[59:43.120 --> 59:44.380]  Oh, hey, by the way...
[59:44.380 --> 59:46.320]  Actually, you did. I teared up a little bit once because of you.
[59:46.320 --> 59:47.280]  Did you really?
[59:47.540 --> 59:51.900]  Yeah, it was the day I got my green card and you were so happy for me that I teared up while we were hugging.
[59:52.240 --> 59:54.360]  Oh my God, it was the best day of my life. Are you kidding?
[59:54.760 --> 59:57.580]  Getting to find out that my best friend in the world wasn't going to go away again.
[59:57.940 --> 01:00:04.260]  You know how much it's like you always talked about how much it sucked to go back to England for nine months until you could come back and spend another summer.
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:07.260]  It was just as sucky for us.
[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:08.900]  We were so sad without you.
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.640]  I'm glad I'm here for good.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:11.620]  I am too.
[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:12.480]  Or until I leave.
[01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:22.700]  Oh, hey, never mind. I don't want to make you cry in the podcast.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:27.960]  I think I could almost make Gavin cry in the podcast right now.
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.180]  Yeah?
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:29.260]  But I don't know.
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:29.740]  What way?
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.160]  Like happy cry?
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:32.540]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:33.120]  Sad cry?
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:33.800]  Okay.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.020]  I mean, it sounds like you're conspiring against me.
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:36.560]  I'm not.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:42.540]  I've been operating under an assumption for a while, and I've never verbalized it to you.
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:43.600]  I don't think.
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:47.140]  But, Gavin, would you be interested in being my best man?
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.540]  Holy, would I have to do a speech?
[01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:51.680]  If you want to, but I wouldn't make you.
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:52.520]  Oh, my God.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:54.640]  I've never been a best man.
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:57.840]  It's always, it's always, I've always considered it to be my worst nightmare.
[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:00.800]  But I've always wanted to be it for someone.
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:02.160]  Why do you think I'm asking you?
[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:03.100]  What about Gus?
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:07.980]  He's a very good friend, and he's going to be in my wedding party.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.920]  And I love him dearly.
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:13.580]  But it would mean the world to me if you would do it.
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:14.800]  I'll definitely do it.
[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:15.260]  When is it?
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:16.260]  What are we doing this?
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.500]  I'm not going to announce the date.
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.780]  Details off the podcast.
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:23.680]  I don't mean the date.
[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:24.420]  I mean, Bull Park.
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:25.500]  Do I have like a month?
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:26.280]  Do I have a year?
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:27.520]  What do you think you need to do?
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.560]  We're getting married in the fall.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.320]  It's this year.
[01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.800]  You've got five months, probably.
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:37.120]  To do what?
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.240]  What are you worried about?
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:40.660]  It's scary.
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.540]  What's scary about it?
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:44.280]  I don't want to ruin it.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.080]  Here's what you have to do.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.820]  Just wear the nice clothes.
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:48.640]  Yeah.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:52.180]  Fucking have chat GPT write a speech.
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.060]  That's fine.
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:02:00.200]  I will say, though, if I had to best man for anyone, it would be the easiest to do it for you.
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.580]  I have so much nice shit to say about you.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.520]  Well, you don't even have to do any of that.
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:06.260]  You just have to be there.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:07.220]  I don't care if you say anything.
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.680]  I don't care if you give a speech or not.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.420]  I had to do that once for my cousin.
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:14.260]  And I was very honored and proud and excited to do it.
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:20.140]  But I understand the stress behind having to write a speech that encapsulates how much you love and care about somebody in that way.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:22.580]  And then recite it in front of a hundred people.
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:25.080]  I wouldn't ask you to do it if you weren't comfortable with it.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:27.320]  I've never been more honored in my life.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:28.680]  Thanks, buddy.
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:32.660]  It's something that I've been wanting to ask you for a long time.
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:35.560]  And I did not plan on doing it on camera.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.140]  I can't believe you did it on the podcast.
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:40.060]  I was going to buy you a present and take you out to dinner and ask you.
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:40.440]  Oh, shit.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:43.860]  But then we got into that whole discussion about crying and heartfelt.
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.620]  And I thought, what better time?
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.980]  Alright, I'm going to do my best to hold it together.
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:50.560]  I think I can do this.
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.180]  Yeah, you're going to be great.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:53.320]  You're going to be awesome.
[01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:54.560]  It's going to be a relief.
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:56.900]  Why am I sweating so much?
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:57.900]  I don't know.
[01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:59.160]  I don't understand.
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:01.020]  I'm just really hot now.
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:11.540]  Well, he didn't cry from his eyes, but he's crying from his head in a sense.
[01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.160]  My body's crying.
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.420]  He's crying all over the place.
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.080]  The back of my neck is weeping.
[01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:22.040]  Oh, man.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.680]  That doesn't have to be content, too.
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:26.620]  If you're not comfortable, we can cut this part of the episode out or anything.
[01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:30.180]  I wasn't trying to do it for content.
[01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:34.920]  It just seemed like a perfect moment to dovetail that conversation.
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:39.380]  And since we never see each other in person, I really don't have many options.
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:50.720]  Oh, one last update.
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:52.820]  I just want to keep you guys informed.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.420]  I went to the mall last week.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:55.460]  It's still going strong.
[01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:57.860]  Looking good.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.240]  Can you pick up some job application forms for various places?
[01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:03.340]  I should have.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.280]  I should have seen if they were hiring.
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:06.320]  Oh, man.
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:07.120]  That would be a dream come true.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.400]  I always wanted to work at a mall so bad when I was younger.
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:11.260]  I also really, really, really...
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:18.020]  I applied to work at a grocery store that everybody in my high school worked at like six times.
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:19.680]  And they just wouldn't fucking hire me.
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:25.000]  Since I was 15 and the grocery store wouldn't hire me, I wanted to work at a grocery store.
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:29.960]  Nothing to make you want something more than not being able to do it.
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.860]  I think it would be so cool to front shelves.
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:34.020]  I loved it.
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:36.640]  Yeah, you had so many stories from it.
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:38.860]  Yeah, and I feel like I've always...
[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:41.180]  I feel like I've always had the creative mind.
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:43.080]  I've always liked making content and filming stuff.
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:46.000]  I still enjoyed that kind of work.
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.300]  It was therapeutic in a way.
[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:51.840]  It's nice to have a job where you can also think about shit at the same time.
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:53.220]  Yeah.
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:54.360]  Highly recommend it.
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:59.500]  I maintain that working... I mean, it's impossible now unless you were in an incredibly niche market.
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:05.180]  But the video store that I worked at for the year that I worked there was, to this day, the best job I've ever had.
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:07.440]  I still think about it fairly regularly.
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:08.600]  How much fun that was.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.720]  How silly it seemed to be getting paid for doing what I was doing.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:21.400]  Which was essentially making jokes with my friends and drinking under the table and trading movies for free pizzas and watching porn.
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.560]  You traded movies for pizza?
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:29.100]  Yeah, there was a pizza shop in the same...
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:33.580]  There was a pizza shop that was in the same strip mall we were in.
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:34.360]  It's very Clucks.
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:37.000]  Yeah, so the employee... Well, this was New Jersey.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:44.220]  So the employees of the pizza shop would come over and we'd let them rent all the free movies if we could call them and order a pizza whenever we wanted.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:45.860]  And then we'd just walk over and get it.
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.740]  Or they'd come over and get some movies and drop one off.
[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:49.080]  And so we worked in trade.
[01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:54.340]  We did that with a little... There was a sub shop, too, that we did that a few times with.
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.660]  But it wasn't the same vibe.
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:58.900]  They had a different management that was a little more on top of stuff.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:02.000]  And then there was a tanning salon.
[01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:02.960]  I think I've mentioned this in the past.
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.300]  It was Sebastian Bach's tanning salon.
[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:08.080]  The guy from Warrant, I believe, is the band he was in.
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:09.360]  And they weren't.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:10.680]  None of us wanted tans.
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:11.620]  So we never...
[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:13.980]  We actually had somebody come over and talk about trade with us.
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:14.940]  And we were like, we're good.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.680]  I wonder if we could do trades in our current industry.
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:19.720]  Is there a service that we want?
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:25.660]  Like, if you wanted plumbing done, could we, the three of us, go to a plumber and just have a conversation in front of him?
[01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:27.400]  Like, trading content for his service?
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:29.040]  Discord Nitro?
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:35.720]  Can we stand at the executives of Discord and give him a five-minute podcast?
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:37.620]  I bet that happens.
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:40.440]  Like, I'm sure there's a dude who's an electrician whose buddy is a plumber.
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.160]  And they're like, I'll do all your electric work.
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.040]  You do all my plumbing work.
[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:44.680]  We just, you know, trade back and forth.
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:49.720]  Or maybe somebody who's an electrician who's got a buddy who's a mechanic.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:50.600]  Who knows?
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:54.660]  Eric wants us to wrap up.
[01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.900]  Eric, do you think you'll be back on form next week?
[01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:02.480]  Give me maybe one more week after that, and then we'll see.
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:07.420]  So, do you think we're week-to-week? If we're doing an injury designation like a sport, you'd be week-to-week right now?
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:08.980]  Oh, definitely week-to-week right now, yeah.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:09.580]  Week-to-week, okay.
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:14.680]  If we can make, if we can compare your mental health to Andrew's ankles, what percentage are we at?
[01:07:17.610 --> 01:07:21.270]  I want to say somewhere between 40 and 60, but not putting exactly at 50.
[01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:24.510]  Okay. It's pretty bad. Maybe you should have a week off.
[01:07:24.610 --> 01:07:26.310]  And that's why I'm week-to-week.
[01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:28.330]  Just go, just like, take the week off.
[01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:31.630]  Okay. Speaking of...
[01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:35.650]  Why don't, wait, wait, why are you saying speaking of? End.
[01:07:36.090 --> 01:07:43.630]  I'm gonna end it right here. Speaking of week-to-week, one of the things I've been doing with the Sloppy Joes videos I've been recording before they went down,
[01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:53.370]  is I've started handling all the falls, like NBA accidents, and then trying to evaluate, like, upper, that's an upper ankle sprain, that's two to three weeks, and then we're gonna do more imaging.
[01:07:53.610 --> 01:07:57.390]  And trying to, like, look at everything through the lens of a sports injury, it's a lot of fun.
[01:07:57.390 --> 01:07:59.590]  Like, that guy will be on the bench for at least six weeks.
[01:07:59.770 --> 01:08:02.570]  Like, that's an ACL. He's out for a year and a half.
[01:08:06.450 --> 01:08:11.270]  Eric, take three responsibilities that you have and distribute them amongst us, and then take a week off.
[01:08:11.610 --> 01:08:15.410]  It's not this show in particular.
[01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:17.650]  No, I'm talking anything. Like, give me something that you do.
[01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:21.230]  You want something that I do?
[01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:24.670]  Give him a meeting. Give him a meeting.
[01:08:24.810 --> 01:08:25.950]  I'm not gonna give you a meeting.
[01:08:27.390 --> 01:08:29.490]  I'm late for a meeting right now.
[01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:31.490]  Oh shit, we should probably end it then.
[01:08:32.230 --> 01:08:38.390]  Hey, thanks for listening to another episode of F*** Face. I particularly enjoyed this one.
[01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:43.650]  I thought it was really heartfelt. I thought it was pretty funny, pretty witty, pretty clever, very dumb.
[01:08:44.010 --> 01:08:46.050]  Hopefully you agreed and you'll tell a friend about it.
[01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:51.510]  Also, this is a prime time to be checking out Rooster Teeth and our YouTube channel.
[01:08:51.690 --> 01:08:56.210]  Not only is it Rooster Teeth's 20th anniversary, we've got lots of, like, really fun, special surprises.
[01:08:57.250 --> 01:09:01.030]  That we've pulled out from the last 20 years to throw at you.
[01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:06.070]  But we've also been making a ton of additional supplemental F*** Face content.
[01:09:06.210 --> 01:09:09.090]  We've got Does It Do's coming out every week.
[01:09:09.150 --> 01:09:10.650]  We've got regulation animations.
[01:09:10.890 --> 01:09:13.730]  We just had Sausage Talk episode 2 come out.
[01:09:13.790 --> 01:09:16.110]  We've got Gavin's Best Of coming out right now.
[01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:19.590]  We've got so much stuff coming out, I can't even tell you what's coming out next week.
[01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:24.030]  But I definitely would like you to check out some of this extra content that we've created.
[01:09:24.030 --> 01:09:29.850]  Because we're pumping it out like, I don't know, like a new mom pumps out breast milk.
[01:09:30.010 --> 01:09:30.970]  We'll see you next week!
[01:09:31.190 --> 01:09:31.370]  What?
[01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:33.470]  Why?
[01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:39.910]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:41.190]  Who forgot the intro?
[01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:43.650]  Has the Vancouver child kicker struck again?
[01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:46.510]  Geoff checks Facebook for the first time in a decade.
[01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:49.170]  It's Geoff Ramsey, XFL hero.
[01:09:49.570 --> 01:09:50.810]  Eric brings up wrestling.
[01:09:51.330 --> 01:09:52.890]  It's time for the erotic 80s.
[01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:54.570]  Geoff can take good photos.
[01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:57.150]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:09:57.550 --> 01:10:00.290]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
