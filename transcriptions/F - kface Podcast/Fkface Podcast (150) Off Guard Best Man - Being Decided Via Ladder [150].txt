[00:00.000 --> 00:01.220]  You ever wonder why we're here?
[00:06.200 --> 00:07.880]  It's one of life's great mysteries, isn't it?
[00:19.310 --> 00:20.890]  You know, I've been thinking about The Bourne Identity.
[00:21.010 --> 00:24.210]  There's a game for The Bourne Identity, and I wonder if that sequence is in it.
[00:24.250 --> 00:26.450]  I don't remember. I haven't played it in a very long time.
[00:26.730 --> 00:27.730]  I bet it's not.
[00:28.710 --> 00:30.810]  I don't think that was a major sequence, really.
[00:31.310 --> 00:33.070]  I couldn't remember where it was in the movie.
[00:33.810 --> 00:35.730]  But I agree, it probably wasn't.
[00:36.750 --> 00:37.930]  It'd be great if it was.
[00:38.770 --> 00:40.050]  It would be really cool to...
[00:40.050 --> 00:42.390]  You know what would be fun is we could try to...
[00:43.570 --> 00:45.630]  We could get the game and try to recreate the moment.
[00:45.770 --> 00:48.310]  Or maybe if there's no multiplayer, we could do it in GTA.
[00:49.230 --> 00:51.050]  Yeah, or like Call of Duty in a Warzone.
[00:51.330 --> 00:52.770]  Yeah, Call of Duty in a Warzone would be great.
[00:53.410 --> 00:54.310]  That would be way easier.
[00:54.470 --> 00:56.750]  Although I guess it would be more fun to do it in real life.
[00:56.810 --> 00:58.150]  That was a short...
[00:58.750 --> 01:02.230]  When you guys show up for pleasantries late, it throws me off how quickly Gavin gets here.
[01:02.530 --> 01:04.270]  It doesn't feel like we even had pleasantries at all.
[01:04.270 --> 01:07.950]  I can't believe at 2.59 Geoff was barely in.
[01:08.290 --> 01:08.930]  He was barely in.
[01:09.390 --> 01:13.150]  They were here at like 4 minutes before.
[01:13.530 --> 01:15.310]  I was editing my notes for today.
[01:15.790 --> 01:17.530]  So I had to wrap that up.
[01:17.570 --> 01:18.110]  That's exciting.
[01:18.790 --> 01:20.150]  Well, you haven't seen my notes yet.
[01:20.770 --> 01:22.950]  No, but I love some Geoff notes.
[01:23.050 --> 01:24.750]  I don't think I've ever been disappointed by Geoff notes.
[01:24.950 --> 01:28.710]  I don't have a lot of shit to talk about that's important or anything.
[01:29.250 --> 01:30.490]  Just a few small things.
[01:31.230 --> 01:34.830]  What do you think is the most important thing we talked about on this show?
[01:35.810 --> 01:38.050]  It might be last week.
[01:38.190 --> 01:39.770]  With Gavin and the best man moment.
[01:39.930 --> 01:41.450]  I think that's a very important moment.
[01:41.450 --> 01:48.570]  Well, I would like to say that since that heartfelt moment that I never intended to share on camera and then it just kind of happened.
[01:48.970 --> 01:50.350]  Gavin and I have not spoken once.
[01:52.030 --> 01:54.470]  That was the point though. You said that in the moment.
[01:55.150 --> 01:55.650]  We've texted.
[01:57.150 --> 01:58.810]  That's speaking. You're talking.
[01:58.810 --> 01:59.890]  What did we text about?
[02:01.150 --> 02:02.030]  The rocks.
[02:03.510 --> 02:04.370]  That's true, we did.
[02:04.630 --> 02:06.530]  We texted about schedule stuff.
[02:06.690 --> 02:07.710]  You're absolutely right.
[02:08.290 --> 02:12.810]  I feel like I handled the best man request so poorly.
[02:14.470 --> 02:18.710]  I think you handled it in the most endearing way.
[02:19.010 --> 02:21.370]  I listened to it back and I was like, wow, I don't sound grateful at all.
[02:21.470 --> 02:24.370]  I couldn't be more blessed to have that request.
[02:24.570 --> 02:26.650]  Honestly, it's one of the best things I've ever been asked.
[02:26.650 --> 02:31.050]  I think you came across as overwhelmed due to how touched you were by the moment.
[02:31.190 --> 02:34.050]  I completely disagree that you didn't seem sincere.
[02:34.370 --> 02:35.430]  I totally agree as well.
[02:36.390 --> 02:40.370]  You're like jazz music. You have to listen to the notes Gavin doesn't play.
[02:40.610 --> 02:42.090]  I've learned that over the years.
[02:42.370 --> 02:44.010]  It's your cool British demeanor.
[02:44.270 --> 02:48.270]  Which I know flies in the face of everything I said about how every British person cries on Traders.
[02:49.510 --> 02:51.430]  You're kind of like the opposite of that.
[02:52.570 --> 02:54.170]  I felt the sincerity.
[02:54.170 --> 02:55.170]  Oh, I'm glad.
[02:55.310 --> 02:58.010]  I mean, you're the only person who I...
[02:58.010 --> 02:59.470]  That's the most important one, right?
[02:59.990 --> 03:01.130]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[03:01.310 --> 03:02.350]  Yeah, I would say so.
[03:03.690 --> 03:04.430]  Eric's pissed off.
[03:04.830 --> 03:05.990]  Yeah, he is. He's already angry.
[03:06.430 --> 03:09.530]  No, I'm not mad. I'm thinking about getting mad, but I'm not mad yet.
[03:09.530 --> 03:10.450]  He's thinking about getting mad.
[03:10.450 --> 03:13.770]  Yeah, I'm just thinking about it. It's all good. Just do the intro. It's all good.
[03:14.090 --> 03:14.930]  What number is this?
[03:15.230 --> 03:16.490]  People keep saying I'm mad.
[03:17.010 --> 03:18.090]  I'm thinking I'm mad.
[03:18.090 --> 03:24.170]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast. My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[03:24.670 --> 03:29.810]  And with me, as always, Andrew Pantin. Way up there in Vancouver Island, Canada.
[03:30.450 --> 03:35.270]  And hanging out in the land of the straight malls, as they're called.
[03:36.110 --> 03:37.250]  And then also...
[03:37.250 --> 03:40.050]  There's a bad mall issue recently.
[03:40.370 --> 03:41.530]  We'll get into it in a second.
[03:41.690 --> 03:46.470]  And then from schmancy-pantsy Oxfordshire, England, by way of Austin, Texas.
[03:47.110 --> 03:48.710]  My favorite Brit, Gavin Free.
[03:48.810 --> 03:49.450]  How are you guys doing?
[03:49.630 --> 03:51.010]  I'm great. How are you guys?
[03:51.510 --> 03:52.250]  I'm f***ing awesome.
[03:53.670 --> 04:00.670]  I'm trying to get into new podcasts, and it always pisses me off until I have a grasp of who's talking when.
[04:01.130 --> 04:03.970]  Do you think all of our voices are easy enough to differentiate?
[04:04.490 --> 04:05.050]  I have no idea.
[04:05.330 --> 04:06.290]  Yeah, I think so.
[04:07.110 --> 04:08.250]  First off, you have an accent.
[04:08.290 --> 04:10.050]  That's what I think goes for us.
[04:11.010 --> 04:14.350]  I sound the opposite of Eric.
[04:17.610 --> 04:18.410]  Yeah, it's...
[04:18.410 --> 04:22.730]  The thing that I always got from FaceJam, like when we started, was people couldn't tell me and Michael apart.
[04:22.930 --> 04:26.090]  I don't understand that, but it's just what we heard a lot.
[04:26.250 --> 04:30.030]  And so I don't think we run into that problem here at all.
[04:30.150 --> 04:31.770]  I think we all are...
[04:31.770 --> 04:38.790]  If you think of it as like a circle, I think we're all at like very far points from each other on the circle.
[04:39.250 --> 04:40.650]  I don't think any of us are close.
[04:40.650 --> 04:43.070]  What's weird is I recently...
[04:43.070 --> 04:48.770]  Somebody I know started listening to the podcast and they told me what my voice sounds like.
[04:48.810 --> 04:50.710]  And I was like, what are you talking? We've talked before.
[04:50.910 --> 04:52.070]  What are you talking about?
[04:52.490 --> 04:55.190]  Why did it take you listening to the podcast?
[04:55.390 --> 04:56.370]  Why are you telling me this?
[04:56.530 --> 04:57.490]  We've had conversations.
[04:57.890 --> 04:59.570]  This is a ridiculous take by you.
[05:00.970 --> 05:01.770]  There's some...
[05:02.270 --> 05:03.430]  There's some great mall drawings.
[05:03.590 --> 05:04.450]  I'm seeing if I can find a photo.
[05:04.450 --> 05:07.430]  There was a guy that was arrested at the mall.
[05:07.590 --> 05:09.750]  That looked like he had a...
[05:09.750 --> 05:10.830]  I don't even know.
[05:10.930 --> 05:11.890]  Like a Mad Max.
[05:12.110 --> 05:14.010]  Like a cartoonish Mad Max weapon.
[05:14.670 --> 05:18.010]  He had like a dollar store crossbow.
[05:18.170 --> 05:19.970]  Like a bow and arrow with a syringe.
[05:20.390 --> 05:20.990]  It's the arrow.
[05:21.590 --> 05:22.790]  It's just very...
[05:22.790 --> 05:25.430]  Not ideal, but the photos of it are just absurd.
[05:25.810 --> 05:27.470]  Was he trying to vaccinate people at range?
[05:27.650 --> 05:28.770]  Yeah, I think so.
[05:28.870 --> 05:29.250]  Potentially.
[05:29.870 --> 05:31.030]  I think that's the best option.
[05:31.030 --> 05:32.950]  He really likes vaccines.
[05:33.030 --> 05:34.750]  And he just wanted to make sure everyone was all good.
[05:35.690 --> 05:37.770]  Maybe he was trying to get on the subreddit mall.
[05:38.050 --> 05:38.070]  Yeah.
[05:38.830 --> 05:39.910]  Eric found it.
[05:40.770 --> 05:43.210]  A Canadian syringe with a crossbow.
[05:43.770 --> 05:44.970]  That was a recent mall incident.
[05:45.990 --> 05:46.390]  Wow.
[05:46.690 --> 05:48.970]  So maybe the mall's taking a little bit of a ding.
[05:49.510 --> 05:50.750]  How much... Andrew, let me ask.
[05:50.790 --> 05:52.070]  How much trouble did you get into?
[05:52.950 --> 05:54.110]  Oh, listen.
[05:54.430 --> 05:56.330]  They don't want to mess with the child kicker. It's fine.
[05:57.290 --> 05:58.610]  A lot of those cops have kids.
[05:59.550 --> 06:00.870]  I'm not saying...
[06:00.870 --> 06:02.530]  I've never kicked a kid. I would never kick a kid.
[06:02.750 --> 06:04.290]  Just, you know, it's a fact.
[06:04.730 --> 06:06.890]  But if you did kick a kid, it wouldn't be a cop's kid.
[06:07.730 --> 06:08.030]  It wouldn't.
[06:10.210 --> 06:11.010]  Could we make
[06:11.010 --> 06:12.770]  an accurate, like, ballistic gel
[06:12.770 --> 06:13.910]  dummy of a kid?
[06:14.670 --> 06:16.610]  So it looks and feels
[06:16.610 --> 06:17.870]  and has the right weight to it.
[06:18.330 --> 06:20.030]  Could we get you to kick it?
[06:20.610 --> 06:22.670]  Yeah, but you know my immediate concern in my head
[06:22.670 --> 06:24.370]  when I play out this scenario is
[06:24.370 --> 06:27.110]  the power of my kick goes through the gel
[06:27.110 --> 06:29.010]  then my ankle rolls
[06:29.010 --> 06:30.590]  and my entire body breaks.
[06:31.430 --> 06:33.150]  You'd be the first person to roll
[06:33.150 --> 06:34.390]  an ankle kicking someone.
[06:34.850 --> 06:36.890]  Yeah, well no, I'm sure that's happened.
[06:37.290 --> 06:38.410]  Like, that has to have happened.
[06:38.510 --> 06:40.430]  I see, like, the Spartan kick
[06:40.430 --> 06:42.570]  and my foot going through the chest
[06:42.930 --> 06:44.870]  and then my other ankle rolling
[06:44.870 --> 06:47.210]  and then me, like, breaking my arm
[06:47.210 --> 06:48.170]  on the way down and just
[06:48.930 --> 06:51.370]  severely just being out of commission for a long time.
[06:51.670 --> 06:52.630]  This is...
[06:53.390 --> 06:53.910]  Yeah.
[06:53.910 --> 06:54.270]  Yeah.
[06:56.890 --> 06:57.610]  That, uh...
[06:57.610 --> 06:59.790]  I gotta say, that syringe, that picture of that syringe
[06:59.790 --> 07:01.690]  in the ground is reminding me of
[07:01.690 --> 07:02.870]  a story.
[07:03.950 --> 07:05.710]  It's not even a story, just something that I remember.
[07:05.810 --> 07:06.870]  It's reminding me of a memory.
[07:08.050 --> 07:09.210]  I'm being memory reminded.
[07:10.050 --> 07:11.970]  Back when I used to run a punk zine
[07:11.970 --> 07:13.670]  back in the, like, late 90s
[07:14.070 --> 07:15.910]  um, you know, I used to get a lot of, like
[07:15.910 --> 07:17.370]  free records in the mail and shit
[07:18.230 --> 07:19.910]  and I got a record
[07:19.910 --> 07:21.570]  one time, I got a CD one time
[07:21.570 --> 07:23.770]  from this punk band called Guttermouth
[07:23.770 --> 07:25.250]  I'm sure Eric knows of them
[07:26.630 --> 07:27.650]  SoCal, California
[07:27.650 --> 07:29.650]  band, very offensive. And it was a
[07:29.650 --> 07:31.790]  live album and on the CD
[07:32.470 --> 07:33.670]  in the, uh
[07:33.670 --> 07:35.710]  in the portion where you open
[07:35.710 --> 07:37.450]  it, there's like the spine, right?
[07:38.170 --> 07:39.570]  In that spine, they
[07:39.570 --> 07:40.670]  included a syringe.
[07:42.130 --> 07:43.590]  Like a working, usable
[07:43.590 --> 07:45.470]  syringe. And I think they got in a lot of
[07:45.470 --> 07:47.490]  trouble and they had to pull it off the shelves
[07:47.490 --> 07:49.570]  and they couldn't sell it anymore. And I still had that
[07:49.570 --> 07:50.810]  I probably could have sold that.
[07:51.410 --> 07:53.710]  I think it's in a landfill somewhere with the rest of the CDs
[07:53.710 --> 07:55.530]  Is it because people didn't know it was in there and they were like
[07:55.530 --> 07:57.450]  pricking themselves? No, you could see it
[07:57.450 --> 07:59.670]  It didn't come with a needle, I think it was just like
[07:59.670 --> 08:01.730]  it was encouraging needle drug use
[08:01.730 --> 08:03.610]  Oh, come on now. And it turned out it was a
[08:03.610 --> 08:04.190]  bad look
[08:05.470 --> 08:07.510]  It's like when, um, I think it was
[08:07.510 --> 08:09.490]  for the Godfather 2 game
[08:09.490 --> 08:11.530]  they mailed brass knuckles out
[08:11.530 --> 08:13.430]  to every press outlet, like everybody
[08:13.430 --> 08:15.570]  that they sent a package to got brass knuckles
[08:15.570 --> 08:17.550]  which ended up being an illegal weapon
[08:17.550 --> 08:19.770]  in a lot of the states that they sent it to
[08:19.770 --> 08:21.430]  and they had to like send the, there was a whole issue
[08:21.850 --> 08:23.790]  The syringe seems fine, without a needle?
[08:23.970 --> 08:25.870]  That seems fine. I didn't know, do you still
[08:26.330 --> 08:27.950]  When was the last time you made a zine?
[08:28.270 --> 08:29.890]  Oh, many many years ago
[08:29.890 --> 08:31.430]  I thought of it, so that's the album
[08:31.430 --> 08:33.750]  and then in the left where you see the happy sad faces
[08:33.750 --> 08:35.690]  there was just a syringe in there that you could pop out
[08:35.690 --> 08:37.130]  Oh that's great! That's crazy
[08:37.130 --> 08:38.650]  Clearly not in that one
[08:39.890 --> 08:41.810]  You know, I thought about making
[08:41.810 --> 08:43.530]  zines for us, obviously
[08:43.530 --> 08:45.570]  the Andrew zine or whatever, but we just haven't
[08:45.570 --> 08:46.550]  I haven't gotten around to it
[08:47.450 --> 08:49.450]  Well, you know what? I guess
[08:49.450 --> 08:51.910]  the last zine I made was Rooster Teeth
[08:51.910 --> 08:52.690]  Because that's kind of
[08:53.390 --> 08:55.630]  what it progressed into
[08:55.630 --> 08:57.590]  It progressed from like punk
[08:57.590 --> 08:59.430]  zine, to other punk zine
[08:59.430 --> 09:01.590]  to comedy zine, to ugly internet, to drunk
[09:01.590 --> 09:03.530]  gamers, to Rooster Teeth, so it was kind of like
[09:03.530 --> 09:05.090]  one long project
[09:05.090 --> 09:06.330]  with many iterations
[09:06.990 --> 09:08.990]  Do you have any of your old zines?
[09:09.910 --> 09:11.030]  Still in collections?
[09:11.430 --> 09:13.570]  No, I was a digital zine, I did everything
[09:13.570 --> 09:14.970]  online, so
[09:15.390 --> 09:17.150]  I do not, unfortunately
[09:17.150 --> 09:19.510]  I might have, maybe I have
[09:19.510 --> 09:21.410]  something printed out, I'd have to look
[09:21.410 --> 09:22.190]  I don't think so though
[09:22.730 --> 09:25.690]  I had a conversation the other day with someone who could never
[09:25.690 --> 09:26.730]  have occurred in real life
[09:27.250 --> 09:29.730]  I was rooting around, I was trying to find something
[09:29.730 --> 09:31.830]  on my old Facebook account
[09:31.830 --> 09:33.710]  which I haven't logged into in a long time
[09:34.190 --> 09:34.890]  and uh
[09:34.890 --> 09:37.430]  I guess like Messenger had an update
[09:37.430 --> 09:39.510]  since I last used it, and I just went over
[09:39.510 --> 09:40.950]  to a different tab, and I was like, oh shit
[09:41.470 --> 09:42.550]  there's messages here from
[09:43.870 --> 09:44.810]  people I actually know
[09:45.370 --> 09:46.850]  as opposed to like a bunch of spam
[09:46.850 --> 09:49.090]  from thousands of people who have just found my profile
[09:49.930 --> 09:50.990]  and uh, it was like
[09:50.990 --> 09:52.970]  Hey, I heard you're in Austin, I've
[09:52.970 --> 09:54.990]  just moved to California, do you
[09:54.990 --> 09:56.710]  want to meet up? And it was one of my friends who I met on a holiday
[09:56.710 --> 09:59.310]  I was like, oh sure, where are you?
[09:59.970 --> 10:00.730]  Where'd you move to?
[10:01.290 --> 10:02.650]  In California, and he replied
[10:02.650 --> 10:04.390]  and was like, uh
[10:04.930 --> 10:06.830]  and he listed where he was, and he was like
[10:06.830 --> 10:08.850]  acting kind of strange, and then I looked at
[10:08.850 --> 10:10.550]  when he'd sent the original message
[10:11.390 --> 10:13.270]  it was May 2013
[10:18.090 --> 10:19.050]  Can you imagine
[10:19.790 --> 10:20.670]  saying like
[10:20.670 --> 10:21.650]  Hey, I'm here
[10:23.290 --> 10:24.350]  Hey, you want to meet up?
[10:24.430 --> 10:26.590]  And then a decade goes by
[10:27.090 --> 10:29.070]  It would have been quicker to talk to me
[10:29.070 --> 10:30.890]  if I was on like Neptune or something
[10:36.690 --> 10:38.590]  You've always got to check when the message
[10:38.590 --> 10:39.030]  was sent
[10:40.150 --> 10:42.510]  It looked like it was right at the top of my thing
[10:42.510 --> 10:44.130]  and it looked new, like it was bold
[10:44.130 --> 10:46.610]  and I was like, oh sweet, I don't know why
[10:46.610 --> 10:48.470]  it was there, it surely should have been under
[10:48.470 --> 10:49.310]  everything else
[10:49.710 --> 10:51.790]  I was so confused, and so was he
[10:53.530 --> 10:54.790]  Did you have a conversation
[10:54.790 --> 10:55.650]  after that?
[10:55.910 --> 10:58.130]  I was like, oh my god, I'm sorry
[11:01.790 --> 11:04.350]  I think it's past the point of apology
[11:04.350 --> 11:06.150]  I don't think you need to apologize for that
[11:06.150 --> 11:08.750]  I think if anything now, we should definitely meet up
[11:08.750 --> 11:10.090]  10 years in the making
[11:10.090 --> 11:14.070]  Sorry for the late reply
[11:14.070 --> 11:14.710]  I've been busy
[11:17.870 --> 11:19.810]  It must have seemed so weird getting that reply
[11:19.810 --> 11:22.230]  without any reference to the massive time gap
[11:22.670 --> 11:23.650]  That's an interesting idea
[11:23.650 --> 11:25.990]  You can only talk to this person in like
[11:25.990 --> 11:27.970]  a one block window every 10 years
[11:27.970 --> 11:30.210]  You need to get everything you need articulated
[11:30.810 --> 11:31.850]  in like a day
[11:31.850 --> 11:34.530]  I felt really bad that he replied immediately
[11:35.390 --> 11:36.110]  That's great
[11:36.930 --> 11:38.650]  That's so much better
[11:39.830 --> 11:42.370]  It honestly felt like he'd sent it 10 years ago
[11:42.370 --> 11:44.170]  and then just waited by the phone
[11:44.170 --> 11:45.550]  for me to reply for a decade
[11:46.250 --> 11:48.750]  Is that the only point of contact that person
[11:48.750 --> 11:49.290]  has with you?
[11:49.570 --> 11:49.810]  Yeah
[11:51.850 --> 11:52.810]  That's fantastic
[11:53.510 --> 11:54.830]  Wow, 10 years
[11:55.730 --> 11:57.470]  I don't think I've...
[11:57.470 --> 12:00.370]  I'm trying to think if I've had a gap of that with anybody
[12:00.370 --> 12:01.910]  I don't know if I have
[12:02.590 --> 12:03.610]  That's a long time
[12:03.610 --> 12:04.110]  10 years
[12:04.110 --> 12:06.730]  You went a couple years without talking to me
[12:06.730 --> 12:09.270]  because you invented that I was mad at you
[12:09.270 --> 12:10.570]  That was like 2 years
[12:11.090 --> 12:12.330]  I was a kid
[12:12.330 --> 12:13.250]  I was dumb
[12:15.150 --> 12:17.350]  I'm still dumb, but I was dumber then
[12:17.910 --> 12:19.690]  I'm slightly smarter then
[12:19.690 --> 12:21.170]  I was when I was
[12:21.830 --> 12:22.270]  18
[12:22.830 --> 12:24.850]  How many people do you think are out there
[12:24.850 --> 12:27.330]  that are in that category
[12:27.330 --> 12:29.390]  of you and I not talking for 2 years
[12:29.390 --> 12:31.590]  or Gavin just not seeing that
[12:31.590 --> 12:33.270]  message from somebody for like 10 years
[12:33.270 --> 12:35.530]  How many people are out there in the periphery of your
[12:35.530 --> 12:37.570]  life who you consider as
[12:37.570 --> 12:38.070]  friends
[12:39.130 --> 12:41.370]  but they no longer consider you
[12:41.370 --> 12:43.330]  as a friend because you didn't see
[12:43.330 --> 12:44.610]  their texts or contact them
[12:44.610 --> 12:47.510]  You just don't know, but they hate you now
[12:47.510 --> 12:48.750]  because they think you ignore them
[12:48.750 --> 12:51.050]  There's gotta be a couple for each of us, right?
[12:51.390 --> 12:52.830]  I got confronted about that
[12:54.890 --> 12:55.370]  Wow
[12:55.370 --> 12:57.810]  By a different person?
[12:57.810 --> 13:00.010]  There was someone I was friends with
[13:00.010 --> 13:02.010]  on the original Red vs. Blue
[13:02.010 --> 13:02.530]  forums
[13:03.990 --> 13:04.790]  2003-2004
[13:04.790 --> 13:06.970]  And I guess at some point they came through Austin
[13:07.630 --> 13:09.890]  and I didn't reply to them because they messaged
[13:09.890 --> 13:11.510]  me on Facebook, which I've
[13:11.510 --> 13:13.430]  never really used for talking to people
[13:14.970 --> 13:16.070]  It was basically
[13:16.070 --> 13:17.310]  I found a message that was like
[13:17.310 --> 13:19.110]  Hey, we're gonna meet Austin. Hey, just check it in
[13:19.730 --> 13:21.350]  Man, I'm kinda bummed that you ignored me
[13:21.350 --> 13:23.570]  I found it like 3 years later
[13:23.570 --> 13:24.590]  Oh man
[13:26.230 --> 13:26.790]  I just
[13:26.790 --> 13:28.670]  don't know. If I've never spoken to you on
[13:28.670 --> 13:30.430]  Facebook, you can't be annoyed that I'm not
[13:30.430 --> 13:32.530]  replying. Clearly you're just not on that platform
[13:32.530 --> 13:34.670]  I had something very similar
[13:34.670 --> 13:36.670]  where I also don't use Facebook
[13:37.490 --> 13:38.630]  ever. I don't know
[13:38.630 --> 13:40.490]  the last time I've checked messages on Facebook
[13:41.210 --> 13:42.370]  And even when I
[13:42.370 --> 13:44.610]  I mean, I've never used it. There was
[13:44.610 --> 13:46.730]  no point where I was a heavy Facebook user
[13:46.730 --> 13:48.670]  And I logged in one time for
[13:48.670 --> 13:50.570]  something or other and I saw a message from
[13:50.570 --> 13:52.170]  one of my best friends in high school
[13:52.530 --> 13:53.910]  And I thought, oh cool
[13:53.910 --> 13:56.190]  I haven't talked to him in like
[13:56.790 --> 13:58.170]  15 years or 20 years
[13:58.170 --> 14:00.190]  even maybe. And it was a message that
[14:00.190 --> 14:01.690]  was like, hey man, just wanted to say
[14:01.690 --> 14:04.190]  it's great to see all the success you're having with Rooster Teeth
[14:04.190 --> 14:05.790]  and stuff. And I was
[14:05.790 --> 14:07.930]  I'd love to get together sometime
[14:07.930 --> 14:09.430]  or I'd really, if you ever wanna
[14:09.870 --> 14:12.450]  send me a DVD or something, I'd love to watch it just to see what you're all about
[14:12.450 --> 14:13.830]  And then it was like
[14:13.830 --> 14:15.430]  Hey man, you must be pretty busy
[14:15.430 --> 14:18.190]  was like the next message. And just get back
[14:18.190 --> 14:19.910]  to me when you can. And then like 2 weeks later
[14:19.910 --> 14:22.210]  he sent a message that was like, fuck you
[14:22.210 --> 14:23.810]  you rich piece of shit
[14:23.810 --> 14:25.790]  you forgot where you came from
[14:25.790 --> 14:27.710]  you've abandoned all your old friends
[14:27.710 --> 14:29.370]  you're too fucking good to talk to us
[14:29.370 --> 14:31.830]  you suck, you suck, I hate you
[14:31.830 --> 14:33.910]  And I saw that message
[14:33.910 --> 14:36.090]  like 3 months after he sent it. And so I was just like
[14:36.090 --> 14:37.710]  well I guess that one's dead
[14:38.590 --> 14:40.010]  Did you even reply to that one?
[14:40.030 --> 14:42.230]  No, fuck no! Oh you should've replied
[14:42.230 --> 14:44.150]  No way! That's so rude
[14:44.150 --> 14:45.590]  I don't use the platform
[14:46.230 --> 14:48.230]  I'm sorry. There should be a thing
[14:48.230 --> 14:49.630]  It sounds like it hadn't been read
[14:50.150 --> 14:52.410]  It has to be like a read receipt or something on it
[14:52.410 --> 14:54.130]  I would assume. I don't know, I don't use Facebook
[14:54.130 --> 14:56.350]  You probably turned it off. But yeah, I don't know
[14:56.830 --> 14:57.890]  That's what I'd assume. It's just
[14:57.890 --> 15:00.450]  fascinating because you're watching that person spiral
[15:00.810 --> 15:01.170]  emotionally
[15:01.930 --> 15:04.150]  So I feel like I definitely would reply
[15:04.150 --> 15:05.890]  because they are so in the wrong
[15:05.890 --> 15:08.230]  Now, what am I going to do? Get in an argument about how
[15:08.230 --> 15:10.290]  and try to defend myself by saying I don't use
[15:10.290 --> 15:11.610]  your shitty social media platform?
[15:12.070 --> 15:12.250]  No
[15:14.150 --> 15:16.190]  That's a lot of conclusions to jump through
[15:16.190 --> 15:17.930]  in the span of like two weeks
[15:17.930 --> 15:20.270]  when I clearly hadn't posted a photo
[15:20.270 --> 15:22.010]  on Facebook in ten years at that point
[15:22.010 --> 15:24.370]  It's not like you'd seen any status updates
[15:24.370 --> 15:25.270]  from me or anything
[15:25.950 --> 15:27.910]  Yeah, but I mean, if you would've replied
[15:27.910 --> 15:30.570]  in their head, you're still ignoring them
[15:32.070 --> 15:34.370]  There's never any resolution on their side
[15:34.370 --> 15:36.410]  Now, as of the day I read
[15:36.410 --> 15:38.170]  that message, I'm fucking ignoring them
[15:39.110 --> 15:40.410]  You're absolutely right
[15:40.410 --> 15:42.490]  I am ignoring that person now. I wasn't
[15:42.490 --> 15:43.710]  but now I am
[15:43.710 --> 15:45.710]  But, when was this?
[15:45.770 --> 15:47.750]  Can we do a Gavin thing? Can you reply
[15:47.750 --> 15:49.730]  ten years from now? Can we schedule it?
[15:49.730 --> 15:50.510]  I'm not doing that
[15:50.510 --> 15:54.150]  This was probably five years ago
[15:54.150 --> 15:56.150]  Oh, we're already halfway to ten
[15:56.150 --> 15:57.710]  I've been ignoring them for about five years
[15:59.790 --> 16:01.690]  It's scary. I would hate to see
[16:01.690 --> 16:03.710]  all of the stuff I've missed from people I really like
[16:05.570 --> 16:07.810]  Are you scared because you might not
[16:07.810 --> 16:10.070]  like them anymore? Is that the risk assessment
[16:10.070 --> 16:11.290]  of what's there?
[16:11.290 --> 16:13.070]  Or that they don't like me because I ignored them
[16:13.670 --> 16:15.230]  Yeah, but I'm saying like that
[16:15.230 --> 16:17.370]  that's ended. Geoff's friendship with this
[16:17.370 --> 16:18.530]  person ended because
[16:19.890 --> 16:23.170]  I would love to talk to them about it
[16:23.170 --> 16:25.150]  but I'm not going to get into a love life thing with anybody
[16:25.150 --> 16:27.230]  And I don't, by the way, I don't
[16:27.230 --> 16:29.050]  I still like the person very much
[16:29.050 --> 16:30.290]  I still, I had a lovely
[16:30.770 --> 16:33.270]  I had a lovely childhood growing up with them
[16:34.930 --> 16:36.450]  Because I would never
[16:38.650 --> 16:39.450]  Andrew, Andrew
[16:39.450 --> 16:41.490]  I would never
[16:42.090 --> 16:43.590]  ever send a message like that
[16:43.590 --> 16:45.010]  to you. Not an honest
[16:45.010 --> 16:47.430]  And I wouldn't send it to anybody else
[16:47.430 --> 16:49.710]  I think it speaks a lot to a person's
[16:49.710 --> 16:51.510]  character when they would do
[16:51.510 --> 16:53.430]  something like that, especially in their 30s
[16:53.430 --> 16:55.030]  or 40s, like it's just like
[16:55.030 --> 16:57.190]  it's a pretty big warning sign to me
[16:57.670 --> 16:58.850]  That's fair, but just
[16:59.270 --> 17:01.350]  if you're taking the angle of I'd like
[17:01.350 --> 17:03.530]  maybe men things in person and I still like
[17:03.530 --> 17:05.430]  them, I don't know. I feel like
[17:05.430 --> 17:07.430]  it's just a low risk, like if
[17:07.430 --> 17:09.810]  it doesn't go well, you can just continue to ignore them
[17:09.810 --> 17:11.690]  Nick said I'm going to get mad Facebook messages
[17:11.690 --> 17:13.170]  now, not that I know of
[17:14.830 --> 17:15.510]  I'll let you know
[17:15.510 --> 17:17.430]  in six years when I need to log into Facebook to
[17:17.430 --> 17:17.990]  check something
[17:21.150 --> 17:23.510]  I'm scared now, I can't really think of anything
[17:23.510 --> 17:25.550]  that I have that's like that
[17:25.550 --> 17:26.770]  There must be, right?
[17:27.110 --> 17:29.250]  Do you have an old ICQ account or
[17:29.250 --> 17:31.690]  any kind of messenger like that that still operates
[17:31.690 --> 17:33.370]  Not really, I was
[17:33.370 --> 17:35.630]  an AIM guy, and then I was on
[17:36.210 --> 17:37.330]  I made a Facebook
[17:37.330 --> 17:39.330]  and a Twitter account, and that's about it
[17:39.330 --> 17:41.630]  as far as social platforms that I used
[17:42.510 --> 17:43.530]  I made a
[17:43.990 --> 17:45.630]  a Lego, Lego has
[17:45.630 --> 17:47.550]  a social media website
[17:47.550 --> 17:49.570]  I made that like a year ago, I don't think
[17:49.570 --> 17:50.670]  anyone's mad at me on there
[17:52.130 --> 17:53.410]  I don't remember what that was called
[17:53.410 --> 17:55.590]  but it was just weird, I was looking through
[17:55.590 --> 17:57.550]  because I'm so disconnected from social media
[17:57.550 --> 17:59.490]  I was just looking through the app store and there's like a
[17:59.490 --> 18:01.370]  Lego social media
[18:01.370 --> 18:03.710]  thing, I think mainly for kids
[18:03.710 --> 18:05.770]  but I don't really know, I made an account
[18:05.770 --> 18:07.990]  it's really dumb, it seems weird
[18:07.990 --> 18:09.030]  I should check
[18:09.030 --> 18:11.850]  Did you enjoy it? I didn't really use it
[18:11.850 --> 18:13.630]  like I made an account and I didn't really understand
[18:13.630 --> 18:15.770]  what the purpose of it was, and I didn't want to talk to
[18:15.770 --> 18:17.430]  anybody, so it's sort of
[18:17.430 --> 18:19.890]  useless, but I wish I could remember what it's called
[18:20.390 --> 18:21.150]  Uh, hey
[18:21.850 --> 18:23.810]  Uh, if you guys will indulge me for a second
[18:23.810 --> 18:25.910]  I have a piece of like
[18:26.330 --> 18:27.910]  I guess a kind of piece of
[18:27.910 --> 18:29.630]  F*** Face related news, or at least
[18:29.630 --> 18:30.950]  Geoff related news that could be
[18:30.950 --> 18:32.030]  Crowbarred in the F*** Face?
[18:32.510 --> 18:35.030]  Well first off, I'm having a crazy sports weekend
[18:35.030 --> 18:36.910]  that I did not intend, but
[18:36.910 --> 18:38.970]  six months ago or so it was
[18:38.970 --> 18:40.890]  announced that the San Antonio Spurs were gonna have
[18:40.890 --> 18:42.930]  two games in Austin, and so
[18:42.930 --> 18:45.130]  I immediately bought tickets for both games
[18:45.130 --> 18:46.930]  Turns out it's tonight and then
[18:46.930 --> 18:49.170]  Saturday night, uh, and of course
[18:49.170 --> 18:50.530]  it's late enough into the season
[18:51.570 --> 18:52.830]  where, uh, like
[18:52.830 --> 18:54.790]  they're playing the Spurs are playing the
[18:55.750 --> 18:56.990]  Portland Trailblazers tonight
[18:56.990 --> 18:58.930]  and of course the Spurs are at a playoff
[18:58.930 --> 19:00.990]  contention and the Trailblazers are at a playoff contention
[19:00.990 --> 19:02.910]  and they shut down Damien Lillard, so it's
[19:02.910 --> 19:04.730]  gonna be like, it's gonna be basically
[19:04.730 --> 19:06.730]  like watching two practice squads play
[19:07.170 --> 19:08.450]  Uh, but still, it's like
[19:08.450 --> 19:10.790]  I couldn't live with myself if NBA basketball
[19:10.790 --> 19:12.990]  came to town and it was five miles away from me and I didn't go to it
[19:12.990 --> 19:14.830]  So I'm gonna see a pointless NBA game tonight
[19:14.830 --> 19:16.790]  and then another pointless NBA game Saturday night
[19:16.790 --> 19:19.030]  Uh, taking Eric with me tonight
[19:19.030 --> 19:20.950]  by the way, uh, very excited about
[19:20.950 --> 19:22.950]  that. Um... You're gonna hang out with Eric?
[19:23.410 --> 19:24.370]  I am gonna hang out with Eric
[19:24.370 --> 19:25.930]  at a basketball game tonight
[19:25.930 --> 19:27.390]  and, uh
[19:28.510 --> 19:29.030]  anyway
[19:30.390 --> 19:31.950]  yesterday, I got an
[19:31.950 --> 19:33.770]  email from
[19:33.770 --> 19:34.510]  uh
[19:35.690 --> 19:38.030]  from the San Antonio Brahmas
[19:38.030 --> 19:40.170]  my favorite XFL football team
[19:40.170 --> 19:42.350]  who would have been the focus of our podcast
[19:42.350 --> 19:44.010]  that never happened, and they said
[19:44.010 --> 19:45.970]  Hey man, we heard you talking about the Brahmas on
[19:45.970 --> 19:47.810]  F*** Face, we wanted to invite you out
[19:47.810 --> 19:49.930]  to a game, so Sunday
[19:49.930 --> 19:52.130]  I'm taking Emily and Millie
[19:52.130 --> 19:54.270]  and we're gonna go down and we're gonna watch a Brahmas game
[19:54.270 --> 19:55.990]  they got us really cool seats by the clubhouse
[19:55.990 --> 19:58.150]  and then they messaged me last night and they said
[19:58.150 --> 20:00.410]  Hey, by the way, uh, if you want
[20:00.410 --> 20:02.470]  we would love it if you would run the team
[20:02.470 --> 20:04.390]  out on the field and we'll announce you
[20:04.390 --> 20:06.390]  and you can go out there with the flags
[20:06.390 --> 20:07.570]  What? You gotta do this
[20:08.070 --> 20:09.070]  Are you serious?
[20:09.750 --> 20:11.390]  It's gonna be on ESPN
[20:11.390 --> 20:13.110]  It's gonna be on ESPN I think
[20:13.110 --> 20:15.310]  So I'm gonna f***ing run the team out
[20:15.990 --> 20:18.730]  Can we clip this part out and release it
[20:18.730 --> 20:20.750]  before this happens?
[20:21.010 --> 20:22.110]  People need to know
[20:22.110 --> 20:24.330]  Geoff, people need to know about this
[20:24.750 --> 20:26.170]  I just confirmed
[20:26.170 --> 20:27.830]  15 minutes before this podcast
[20:27.830 --> 20:29.750]  I was like, I thought about it for a while and I was like, I don't know if I wanna
[20:29.750 --> 20:30.910]  and I was like, you know what, f*** it
[20:30.910 --> 20:33.290]  I'll never get that opportunity again
[20:33.290 --> 20:36.030]  Are you kidding? I like the idea that
[20:36.030 --> 20:38.150]  a minute ago, you're like, I'd never live with
[20:38.150 --> 20:40.510]  myself if I missed the NBA coming to town
[20:40.510 --> 20:42.550]  and then like an opportunity
[20:42.550 --> 20:44.170]  to be on ESPN and run
[20:44.170 --> 20:46.750]  a team onto the field, be like, I don't know about that
[20:46.750 --> 20:48.410]  I've gotta come to terms with the fact
[20:48.410 --> 20:49.930]  that people can hear this podcast
[20:49.930 --> 20:50.950]  I feel like
[20:51.450 --> 20:52.530]  it's so dangerous
[20:53.370 --> 20:54.770]  Did I s*** on their logo?
[20:56.570 --> 20:57.490]  Yeah, I did
[20:57.490 --> 20:58.630]  You probably did
[20:58.630 --> 21:02.210]  I defended it, I love the logo and I think Andrew does too
[21:02.210 --> 21:04.030]  Can we clip this part out
[21:04.030 --> 21:05.570]  and release it so people know
[21:05.570 --> 21:07.710]  that this is happening? Are you fine with that, Geoff?
[21:07.790 --> 21:09.910]  Didn't you just ask that? I'm totally fine with that
[21:09.910 --> 21:11.270]  Right, but I wanna make sure
[21:11.270 --> 21:12.110]  He didn't get an answer
[21:12.110 --> 21:15.510]  Right, I asked it and then nobody said f***ing s*** about it
[21:15.510 --> 21:17.810]  I've said yes both times
[21:17.810 --> 21:20.190]  I'm like the least qualified to prove it
[21:21.390 --> 21:23.410]  What would the preview do for us?
[21:23.830 --> 21:25.730]  You know how Geoff's been doing like, oh, coming up on
[21:25.730 --> 21:27.830]  episode X of F*** Face
[21:27.830 --> 21:28.710]  on Instagram
[21:28.710 --> 21:30.770]  Geoff, I'm so excited for you
[21:30.770 --> 21:33.530]  This comes out on the week of the 19th
[21:34.690 --> 21:36.210]  Have you thought about what you're gonna wear?
[21:36.430 --> 21:37.330]  I don't know
[21:37.330 --> 21:39.450]  You should wear the F*** Face baseball uniform
[21:39.450 --> 21:40.350]  Geoff, I might
[21:41.750 --> 21:44.110]  Can I? Andrew said yes
[21:45.070 --> 21:45.950]  Gavin thought
[21:45.950 --> 21:46.770]  We all said yes
[21:46.770 --> 21:49.630]  I'm asking you, the person this is happening to
[21:49.630 --> 21:51.950]  Can I clip this part out and can we
[21:51.950 --> 21:54.130]  release it early, like this particular part
[21:54.130 --> 21:56.130]  where you announce it and let people know
[21:56.130 --> 21:58.210]  that you're going to be there running the team out on the field
[21:58.210 --> 21:59.470]  I'm totally fine with that
[21:59.470 --> 22:00.750]  Thank you
[22:00.750 --> 22:03.970]  And we can do it as preview of episode 150
[22:03.970 --> 22:06.110]  before even 149
[22:06.110 --> 22:07.950]  That's the issue
[22:07.950 --> 22:09.950]  that I'm running into when you say that
[22:09.950 --> 22:11.810]  is that we're previewing an episode
[22:12.570 --> 22:13.030]  before
[22:13.030 --> 22:14.910]  the next episode
[22:14.910 --> 22:15.770]  I think that's great
[22:15.770 --> 22:18.530]  That is, imagine
[22:18.530 --> 22:21.150]  Gavin, imagine if a preview for the
[22:21.150 --> 22:22.690]  next Matrix movie came out
[22:22.690 --> 22:24.470]  but it's not the next Matrix movie
[22:24.470 --> 22:26.190]  it's the one after it
[22:26.190 --> 22:28.890]  I think that's very interesting
[22:28.890 --> 22:31.190]  it's once again, we're playing with the medium
[22:31.710 --> 22:33.270]  and people will be wondering
[22:33.270 --> 22:34.470]  they'll be like
[22:34.890 --> 22:36.350]  don't you mean 149?
[22:36.690 --> 22:36.870]  Nope
[22:36.870 --> 22:40.710]  Have you guys seen the trailer for Matrix 5 yet?
[22:40.710 --> 22:42.890]  I thought they haven't announced Matrix 4
[22:42.890 --> 22:43.910]  They haven't
[22:45.670 --> 22:46.430]  Okay, alright
[22:46.430 --> 22:47.750]  we'll clip this out, we'll let people know
[22:47.750 --> 22:50.510]  Geoff, I'm so, this is the coolest
[22:50.510 --> 22:51.950]  fucking thing in the world to me
[22:51.950 --> 22:54.530]  I'm pretty excited, I think it's going to be a lot of fun
[22:54.530 --> 22:56.630]  This rules, you're going to run a team
[22:56.630 --> 22:58.650]  out on the field, this rips
[22:58.650 --> 23:00.210]  dude, this is so cool
[23:00.910 --> 23:02.810]  It's wild, right? I was probably just going to wear
[23:02.810 --> 23:04.730]  like a Brahma's hoodie, but I don't know how hot it would be
[23:04.730 --> 23:07.110]  I'll definitely try to wear like my f*** face hat
[23:07.110 --> 23:09.010]  or maybe a baseball jersey
[23:09.010 --> 23:09.570]  or something
[23:09.570 --> 23:12.970]  I think wearing the baseball jersey would be hilarious
[23:12.970 --> 23:14.730]  A guy dressed in a baseball uniform
[23:18.950 --> 23:20.810]  You didn't have time to change
[23:20.810 --> 23:23.410]  You're a multi-sport athlete, and you had to go
[23:23.410 --> 23:24.710]  There's no more time
[23:25.290 --> 23:26.470]  Oh man, that's funny
[23:27.250 --> 23:28.910]  Anyway, so it's going to be like a crazy
[23:28.910 --> 23:29.990]  fucking sports weekend
[23:30.510 --> 23:32.690]  and as somebody who's mostly a shut-in
[23:32.690 --> 23:35.470]  the idea of going to three events and one out of town
[23:35.470 --> 23:37.030]  in four days is a little daunting to me
[23:37.030 --> 23:38.930]  but I'm going to soldier through it
[23:39.550 --> 23:41.250]  I am so excited for you
[23:41.250 --> 23:42.310]  What a time
[23:42.310 --> 23:43.190]  It's pretty cool
[23:43.850 --> 23:46.950]  There's no way where this doesn't become more content
[23:46.950 --> 23:48.770]  and I think that's what excites me the most
[23:48.770 --> 23:51.290]  All the ways, respectfully to you, and I hope it doesn't
[23:51.290 --> 23:53.210]  There's so many ways this could go wrong
[23:53.210 --> 23:55.170]  There's so many ways in which this could fail
[23:55.170 --> 23:57.130]  for you, and no matter what happens
[23:57.130 --> 23:58.650]  I'm really excited about it
[23:58.650 --> 24:00.310]  I was thinking to myself
[24:00.870 --> 24:03.150]  Have you ever seen the episode of Always Sunny
[24:03.150 --> 24:05.130]  where they're practicing
[24:05.130 --> 24:07.070]  hockey because they're going to shoot the
[24:07.070 --> 24:09.150]  slap shot to try to win $50,000 or whatever
[24:09.150 --> 24:11.170]  and Mac, he ends up falling and
[24:11.170 --> 24:12.970]  cracking his head open and they play it on
[24:12.970 --> 24:14.390]  SportsCenter over and over again
[24:14.950 --> 24:16.010]  and that's the highlight
[24:16.730 --> 24:19.190]  If I can trip and be like
[24:19.190 --> 24:21.070]  whacked in the head by one of the
[24:21.070 --> 24:23.090]  flags or it like goes up
[24:23.090 --> 24:25.010]  my butt and lifts me off the ground or something
[24:25.010 --> 24:26.110]  and then I fucking fall
[24:26.750 --> 24:28.990]  I'm kind of hoping something catastrophic happens
[24:28.990 --> 24:31.270]  just so I can make not top ten plays of the day
[24:32.070 --> 24:32.470]  Yeah
[24:32.470 --> 24:34.210]  I think you gotta evaluate
[24:34.210 --> 24:35.830]  a blown quad for sure
[24:36.470 --> 24:37.830]  like your knee exploding
[24:38.450 --> 24:38.970]  Exactly
[24:39.950 --> 24:41.610]  Yeah, you gotta factor in those injuries
[24:41.610 --> 24:44.110]  I know Eric definitely would have seen this
[24:44.110 --> 24:46.310]  Did you see the clip of Shane McMahon at
[24:46.310 --> 24:48.590]  Wrestlemania getting hurt this past weekend?
[24:49.210 --> 24:49.750]  The timing of it?
[24:50.050 --> 24:51.530]  He had a match with The Miz
[24:51.530 --> 24:53.930]  and it's hilarious where
[24:53.930 --> 24:56.210]  I guess Eric would probably know better than I would
[24:56.210 --> 24:59.010]  It felt like Shane hadn't wrestled in a long time
[24:59.010 --> 24:59.850]  I'm assuming
[24:59.850 --> 25:01.910]  and so this is like their big Wrestlemania
[25:01.910 --> 25:03.890]  match and they start the match
[25:03.890 --> 25:06.050]  and he jumps over The Miz and the announcer
[25:06.050 --> 25:07.710]  yells, Shane still got it!
[25:07.750 --> 25:09.830]  While Shane simultaneously blew his
[25:09.830 --> 25:11.910]  quad out. He just falls to the
[25:11.910 --> 25:13.410]  ground. He couldn't do it. But luckily
[25:13.410 --> 25:15.870]  Snoop Dogg was like leading him into
[25:15.870 --> 25:17.730]  the match. He was like Shane's guy for it
[25:17.730 --> 25:19.930]  and so they're panicking and they're like, what are we
[25:19.930 --> 25:21.950]  gonna do? This guy blew his
[25:21.950 --> 25:23.710]  knee out within like 20 seconds
[25:23.710 --> 25:25.650]  Snoop Dogg calls an audible
[25:26.150 --> 25:27.830]  jumps into the ring and punches
[25:27.830 --> 25:29.970]  The Miz and then just goes off
[25:29.970 --> 25:31.890]  on the mic about it and it's like, how
[25:31.890 --> 25:33.450]  can you do this to my man Shane?
[25:33.790 --> 25:35.950]  And he hits him a second time and then he just
[25:35.950 --> 25:38.010]  started posing and he did one of the worst
[25:38.010 --> 25:39.830]  people's elbows I've ever seen to The Miz
[25:39.830 --> 25:41.970]  so they'd have an ending. But they improvised all of it
[25:41.970 --> 25:44.030]  because the guy blew his knee out. And is the guy
[25:44.030 --> 25:45.890]  just rolling around on the ground in
[25:45.890 --> 25:47.790]  pain while Snoop Dogg- Yeah, they like
[25:47.790 --> 25:49.510]  extracted him at a certain point
[25:49.510 --> 25:51.290]  They just got him out of it.
[25:52.010 --> 25:53.990]  That's Shane McMahon. I just sent the clip
[25:53.990 --> 25:55.750]  of Shane McMahon doing the leapfrog
[25:55.750 --> 25:57.710]  landing and blowing his
[25:57.710 --> 25:58.430]  quad out.
[25:59.490 --> 26:01.790]  Oh! I recognize that from
[26:01.790 --> 26:03.630]  the NBA. He ain't going nowhere.
[26:03.990 --> 26:05.770]  Oh my god. That's 18 months of
[26:05.770 --> 26:07.230]  rehab. Yeah. Oof.
[26:07.790 --> 26:09.690]  Isn't it crazy how your body could
[26:09.690 --> 26:11.610]  just immediately fail without warning?
[26:11.890 --> 26:13.530]  Yeah. It was really
[26:13.530 --> 26:15.030]  something. And then, uh,
[26:15.490 --> 26:17.650]  I can send the clip of Snoop Dogg
[26:17.650 --> 26:19.310]  doing the people's elbow.
[26:19.710 --> 26:20.850]  Oh, so good!
[26:21.050 --> 26:22.650]  This was all improv.
[26:22.650 --> 26:24.790]  Like, they kept yelling at him
[26:24.790 --> 26:26.770]  Snoop! People's elbow! Do the
[26:26.770 --> 26:28.770]  people's elbow! Do the people's
[26:28.770 --> 26:30.510]  elbow! Then he did it
[26:30.510 --> 26:32.170]  and everybody
[26:32.730 --> 26:34.810]  cheered and then they played
[26:34.810 --> 26:36.730]  a Snoop Dogg song and he danced around
[26:37.490 --> 26:38.990]  It was pretty
[26:38.990 --> 26:40.650]  It was pretty crazy.
[26:40.790 --> 26:42.070]  It was pretty fucking crazy.
[26:42.990 --> 26:44.730]  It's the way he bounces off the
[26:44.730 --> 26:46.190]  ropes makes me laugh so hard.
[26:46.630 --> 26:48.770]  It's the daintiest. It's
[26:48.770 --> 26:50.670]  tough to do that. It's a difficult
[26:50.670 --> 26:52.730]  thing. It looks like he was just, like, peeping out a
[26:52.730 --> 26:52.970]  window.
[26:55.190 --> 26:56.630]  So, anyone out there? Nope.
[26:57.110 --> 26:58.590]  We gotta get this podcast
[26:58.590 --> 27:00.770]  big enough so that Eric can do
[27:00.770 --> 27:02.310]  that on a wrestling. I mean,
[27:02.470 --> 27:04.630]  honestly, I could probably just go
[27:04.630 --> 27:06.610]  to a local show in Austin and do
[27:06.610 --> 27:08.550]  that now. It just won't be at
[27:08.550 --> 27:09.770]  Wrestlemania ever.
[27:10.750 --> 27:12.410]  Yeah, but we want it to be at Wrestlemania. Okay.
[27:12.850 --> 27:13.450]  Sounds good.
[27:15.390 --> 27:16.890]  Eric, why don't you just become
[27:16.890 --> 27:18.830]  a local wrestler? Oh, it hurts.
[27:18.830 --> 27:20.410]  It hurts.
[27:20.790 --> 27:22.570]  Yeah, it seems really painful. It is very painful.
[27:22.810 --> 27:24.830]  Whether you have a good match
[27:24.830 --> 27:26.350]  or a bad match, it hurts the same.
[27:26.910 --> 27:28.750]  And that was a big revelation
[27:28.750 --> 27:30.110]  when I learned how to do it.
[27:30.830 --> 27:32.830]  But you're all about it. Like, wouldn't you want to be stuck
[27:32.830 --> 27:34.610]  in? I mean, it's fun.
[27:35.290 --> 27:35.930]  But, like,
[27:36.350 --> 27:38.330]  it seems like then you have to, like, you're either gonna
[27:38.330 --> 27:40.690]  weekend warrior the thing, and you're just gonna kind of, like,
[27:40.690 --> 27:42.610]  be at a level, and then it's, like, an
[27:42.610 --> 27:44.210]  obligation every week, or
[27:44.570 --> 27:45.810]  it's fun just to go to shows.
[27:46.710 --> 27:47.830]  It would be fun as, like, a
[27:47.830 --> 27:49.810]  one-off thing, but that's it. I don't think I could
[27:49.810 --> 27:52.110]  ever, like, do it. To do it consistently,
[27:52.290 --> 27:53.830]  especially, and I know there are people
[27:53.830 --> 27:55.830]  that have started wrestling at an older age.
[27:56.130 --> 27:57.870]  I feel like once you've
[27:57.870 --> 27:59.930]  hit an age where you wake up with injuries
[27:59.930 --> 28:01.850]  that you don't know how they happened, the idea
[28:01.850 --> 28:03.810]  of wrestling is so much less appealing.
[28:04.030 --> 28:05.930]  Like, that's a real... that's
[28:05.930 --> 28:07.930]  a real pursuit. Yeah, it's a lot. And I don't...
[28:07.930 --> 28:10.010]  it's a lot. That's kind of how I feel about stand-up.
[28:10.110 --> 28:11.910]  It's fun to do, like, three times. Yeah!
[28:12.290 --> 28:14.010]  I think that's a good way to... I think it's
[28:14.010 --> 28:16.130]  kind of, like, the same exact thing.
[28:16.510 --> 28:18.070]  It's, like, this is neat, but
[28:18.070 --> 28:19.570]  also, if I had to do this
[28:20.290 --> 28:21.550]  four times a week,
[28:22.110 --> 28:24.270]  every week, I would never.
[28:24.450 --> 28:25.830]  I would never. Yeah, you don't
[28:25.830 --> 28:27.890]  want to get hurt. You don't want to take that kind of pain,
[28:28.010 --> 28:29.210]  and I don't want to stay up late.
[28:30.450 --> 28:32.130]  You look at people now, like
[28:32.130 --> 28:33.730]  Mick Foley, and people who,
[28:33.990 --> 28:36.110]  like, whatever, it's like, I know, wrestling's fake
[28:36.110 --> 28:38.170]  and all that stuff. But the guy's, like, got no
[28:38.170 --> 28:40.090]  teeth, and his ear is missing,
[28:40.330 --> 28:41.910]  and he, like,
[28:41.910 --> 28:43.650]  fell through the top of a cage.
[28:43.810 --> 28:45.850]  That guy was absolutely nuts.
[28:46.010 --> 28:47.590]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[28:48.010 --> 28:49.770]  I have some friends that wrestle. I have a friend who
[28:49.770 --> 28:52.010]  wrestles locally, here, and kind of all over
[28:52.010 --> 28:53.730]  Texas. This guy, Dimitri Alexandrov.
[28:54.170 --> 28:55.930]  And he does a lot of death
[28:55.930 --> 28:57.690]  match wrestling, which is,
[28:58.910 --> 29:00.030]  like, if you're not familiar,
[29:00.230 --> 29:01.790]  he goes through
[29:01.790 --> 29:03.690]  glass panels, and
[29:03.690 --> 29:05.990]  into thumbtacks, and gets cut up
[29:05.990 --> 29:07.630]  with stuff, and hit with stuff, and
[29:08.610 --> 29:10.190]  it's always, like,
[29:10.190 --> 29:12.270]  man, you just really love
[29:12.270 --> 29:14.090]  this, huh? And, uh,
[29:14.390 --> 29:15.990]  he does, but also,
[29:16.310 --> 29:18.110]  this is what he looks like all
[29:18.110 --> 29:19.930]  the time. Uh,
[29:20.170 --> 29:22.370]  he's just beat up, cut
[29:22.370 --> 29:23.730]  up, constantly.
[29:24.510 --> 29:26.090]  Constantly. Yeah. It's
[29:26.090 --> 29:27.470]  fucked, man. It's really rough.
[29:27.890 --> 29:30.310]  I feel like I'm in a great spot
[29:30.310 --> 29:32.350]  with wrestling, where it's, like, I'll occasionally
[29:32.350 --> 29:34.230]  hear dumb things about
[29:34.230 --> 29:36.210]  it that make me really appreciate it, but then
[29:36.210 --> 29:38.170]  I'm not super, like, it'd be
[29:38.170 --> 29:40.210]  fun to, it just seems like a big commitment to keep up to
[29:40.210 --> 29:41.350]  date with everything that happens. It does.
[29:42.270 --> 29:43.770]  But it's great whenever you hear, like, I
[29:43.770 --> 29:46.530]  recently learned that in the past, Ray Mysterio
[29:46.530 --> 29:47.790]  has a kid named Dominic,
[29:48.150 --> 29:49.950]  and they had a ladder match for the custody
[29:49.950 --> 29:51.590]  of Dominic in the past.
[29:51.770 --> 29:54.070]  That is a premise that's so
[29:54.070 --> 29:56.170]  funny to me. I don't know anything else about
[29:56.170 --> 29:58.330]  the context of it, but I just love the idea of a custody
[29:58.330 --> 30:00.190]  battle being settled via ladder match.
[30:01.250 --> 30:02.070]  Oh, that's fucking awesome.
[30:02.070 --> 30:03.590]  That's the image from the paper.
[30:03.590 --> 30:05.810]  Oh my god!
[30:06.350 --> 30:07.510]  That poor little kid!
[30:07.830 --> 30:09.330]  That's so good. But now he's
[30:09.330 --> 30:11.550]  a great heel. He's an amazing
[30:11.550 --> 30:13.970]  wrestler. He just wrestled his dad, Ray Mysterio,
[30:14.070 --> 30:15.850]  at Wrestlemania. It was pretty crazy.
[30:17.690 --> 30:19.870]  Well, I guess he's got some missions to work out, probably.
[30:21.890 --> 30:23.550]  Wow, I didn't expect that from being
[30:23.550 --> 30:24.930]  pawned off in a ladder match.
[30:26.730 --> 30:27.670]  I think I'd like
[30:27.670 --> 30:28.970]  to be decided through a ladder match.
[30:29.390 --> 30:31.950]  I think that'd be fun. Well...
[30:34.310 --> 30:35.830]  At least you can tell both people
[30:35.830 --> 30:36.510]  want me.
[30:39.890 --> 30:43.190]  You just want to be wanted.
[30:44.470 --> 30:45.450]  That's so...
[30:45.450 --> 30:47.930]  spoken like a true child of divorce.
[30:48.190 --> 30:48.930]  God damn, man.
[30:48.950 --> 30:51.630]  I just want you people to want me.
[30:54.410 --> 30:55.710]  It reminds me
[30:55.710 --> 30:57.410]  of when my parents got divorced.
[30:57.910 --> 30:59.650]  My stepdad said, I'm still gonna be
[30:59.650 --> 31:01.170]  a part of your life, don't you worry.
[31:01.170 --> 31:02.890]  And then he went out to get the ladder
[31:02.890 --> 31:05.070]  for the ladder match, and I'm still waiting for him to come back.
[31:09.410 --> 31:10.170]  God damn.
[31:10.910 --> 31:12.870]  It's so sad. I think more
[31:12.870 --> 31:14.310]  stuff should be decided like that.
[31:14.750 --> 31:17.030]  If people want to quit their job, you should just
[31:17.030 --> 31:19.030]  have to play for it. You should have to wrestle for it.
[31:27.000 --> 31:28.880]  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[31:29.520 --> 31:30.920]  Getting to know yourself can be
[31:30.920 --> 31:33.020]  a lifelong process, especially because
[31:33.020 --> 31:34.560]  we're always growing and changing.
[31:35.180 --> 31:36.940]  And it's so important that as we go
[31:36.940 --> 31:38.880]  through these changes and are growing as people
[31:38.880 --> 31:41.060]  that we evaluate how things are
[31:41.060 --> 31:43.000]  impacting us. Therapy is
[31:43.000 --> 31:44.940]  all about deepening your self-awareness and
[31:44.940 --> 31:47.040]  understanding because sometimes we don't know
[31:47.040 --> 31:49.080]  what we want or why we react the way
[31:49.080 --> 31:50.740]  we do until we talk through things.
[31:51.280 --> 31:53.160]  BetterHelp connects you with a licensed therapist
[31:53.160 --> 31:55.440]  who can take you on that journey of self-discovery
[31:55.440 --> 31:56.940]  from wherever you are.
[31:57.620 --> 31:59.100]  Therapy, I think, is a wonderful
[31:59.100 --> 32:01.040]  thing. It has had a tremendous impact
[32:01.040 --> 32:03.060]  in my life. I would highly recommend
[32:03.060 --> 32:05.120]  anyone try it. I just think
[32:05.120 --> 32:07.020]  it's such an important process to go through
[32:07.020 --> 32:09.120]  as a person. So if you're thinking
[32:09.120 --> 32:11.200]  of starting therapy, give BetterHelp

[34:08.880 --> 34:10.580]  Oh man, hey speaking
[34:10.580 --> 34:12.340]  of wrestling, do you remember that movie
[34:12.340 --> 34:13.980]  The Wrestler with Mickey Rourke?
[34:15.080 --> 34:16.800]  Absolutely. Well I watched another
[34:16.800 --> 34:17.920]  movie with Mickey Rourke.
[34:17.920 --> 34:18.240]  Oh.
[34:19.760 --> 34:22.000]  Well, you know, I've been
[34:22.000 --> 34:23.820]  reading the comments and people seem to like him
[34:23.820 --> 34:25.840]  but I like the experimentation of it
[34:25.840 --> 34:27.100]  so here's what I did.
[34:27.960 --> 34:29.760]  I watched two movies
[34:30.660 --> 34:31.940]  one of them I think we
[34:31.940 --> 34:34.140]  may have talked about on this podcast before, I can't
[34:34.140 --> 34:35.980]  remember. But one thing that I've learned
[34:37.020 --> 34:37.720]  is that
[34:37.720 --> 34:39.940]  every piece of content
[34:39.940 --> 34:41.400]  that was created
[34:42.180 --> 34:43.780]  more than five years ago
[34:43.780 --> 34:45.100]  is problematic.
[34:46.040 --> 34:47.060]  Every piece of
[34:47.060 --> 34:48.980]  content that was made more than
[34:48.980 --> 34:51.360]  20 years ago is beyond
[34:51.360 --> 34:52.120]  problematic.
[34:52.920 --> 34:55.040]  And that was not my intention when I watched these movies
[34:55.040 --> 34:56.780]  but I watched the 1987
[34:56.780 --> 34:58.420]  film Angel Heart
[34:59.000 --> 35:00.980]  with Mickey Rourke and Lisa Bonet
[35:00.980 --> 35:02.700]  in it. And I watched this movie
[35:02.700 --> 35:05.240]  specifically because I remember
[35:05.240 --> 35:06.720]  wanting to watch it when I was a kid
[35:06.720 --> 35:08.980]  but I was too scared. Cause there's like
[35:08.980 --> 35:11.120]  some voodoo stuff in it and it was too scary
[35:11.120 --> 35:13.060]  for me. And so I thought, the other night
[35:13.060 --> 35:15.160]  I wasn't sleepy, I was
[35:15.160 --> 35:17.160]  playing Gems of War after Emily went to bed and I got
[35:17.160 --> 35:18.800]  bored and I thought, I'm gonna watch a movie. And so I
[35:18.800 --> 35:21.140]  was like, you know, it just popped into my head and I thought, fuck it
[35:21.140 --> 35:22.960]  I'm gonna watch it. I got about
[35:22.960 --> 35:25.160]  20 minutes in before I had to turn it off cause it was too scary
[35:25.160 --> 35:26.860]  but then I watched it the next morning.
[35:27.200 --> 35:29.160]  So let me just say, if you wanna watch Angel Heart, watch it in the
[35:29.160 --> 35:31.120]  morning. But I don't know how to
[35:31.120 --> 35:32.940]  really give a review for these problematic
[35:32.940 --> 35:35.160]  films, so I just decided to give insights
[35:35.600 --> 35:37.060]  and by the way, let me say
[35:37.060 --> 35:38.980]  specifically to Angel Heart, not to the other movie
[35:39.900 --> 35:41.180]  it's beautiful. Like, it is
[35:41.180 --> 35:43.040]  one of the most cinematic films I've ever seen
[35:43.040 --> 35:45.140]  it's so beautifully shot. Just
[35:45.140 --> 35:46.980]  from a technical standpoint, it is phenomenal.
[35:47.420 --> 35:49.280]  Can I ask, were you scared to watch it while
[35:49.280 --> 35:50.700]  you were...
[35:50.700 --> 35:53.260]  were you watching this in bed next to sleeping Emily?
[35:53.760 --> 35:54.760]  No, I was in the living room.
[35:54.980 --> 35:57.220]  Oh, okay. Do you think if you were in the bedroom watching it, you would have been
[35:57.220 --> 35:58.000]  able to handle it?
[35:59.300 --> 36:01.060]  No, and I wouldn't have done it cause I would have
[36:01.060 --> 36:02.700]  jumped so much it would have woken her up.
[36:03.640 --> 36:05.280]  I don't think you can watch scary next to
[36:05.280 --> 36:06.780]  somebody sleeping. I think that's too dangerous.
[36:07.340 --> 36:09.200]  Yeah, if you're somebody who reacts to it, that's
[36:09.200 --> 36:10.340]  definitely a selfish move.
[36:10.560 --> 36:13.200]  I always remember, and I don't mean this to
[36:13.200 --> 36:15.240]  be mean, but I always remember Mickey Rourke as being kind of a
[36:15.240 --> 36:17.260]  joke actor because he kind of
[36:17.260 --> 36:19.440]  went off the deep end after nine and a half weeks
[36:19.440 --> 36:21.200]  and Wild Orchid
[36:21.200 --> 36:23.340]  and he just got weird, right?
[36:23.620 --> 36:24.920]  But he was so
[36:24.920 --> 36:26.640]  fucking good and
[36:27.150 --> 36:29.280]  so good looking. Like, he was a
[36:29.280 --> 36:31.160]  really attractive guy in 1987
[36:31.160 --> 36:33.160]  in this movie, Angel Heart. Like, holy shit.
[36:33.660 --> 36:35.260]  But anyway, here's my insights to it.
[36:35.640 --> 36:37.040]  Here's all I'll say about...
[36:37.040 --> 36:38.880]  Because I don't really want to recommend these movies
[36:38.880 --> 36:40.600]  or not, I'm just going to say the
[36:40.600 --> 36:42.860]  particular insights that I've learned.
[36:43.400 --> 36:44.780]  And this one, I'm just going to give you a warning.
[36:46.140 --> 36:46.920]  What did I write down?
[36:46.940 --> 36:49.120]  Here we go. Angel Heart. This is a tough movie
[36:49.120 --> 36:50.780]  to watch if you like chickens.
[36:52.180 --> 36:52.540]  Conversely,
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.020]  this is a really tough movie to watch if you
[36:55.020 --> 36:56.960]  don't like chickens. So that's
[36:56.960 --> 36:58.600]  all I'm going to say about Angel Heart.
[36:59.440 --> 37:01.080]  The other movie I watched, which is one
[37:01.080 --> 37:02.860]  I think, I can't remember if we've talked about
[37:02.860 --> 37:04.440]  or you and I have talked about personally, Gavin,
[37:04.960 --> 37:06.660]  is a movie called Dressed to Kill.
[37:07.280 --> 37:08.820]  Does that ring a bell? Have we discussed that?
[37:09.140 --> 37:10.120]  Like that, yeah.
[37:10.580 --> 37:11.100]  Dressed to Kill.
[37:11.640 --> 37:14.600]  It sounds familiar. It came out in 1980.
[37:14.780 --> 37:16.000]  It's a Brian De Palma film.
[37:16.940 --> 37:18.180]  Deeply problematic film.
[37:19.560 --> 37:20.620]  Stars Michael Caine.
[37:20.840 --> 37:22.500]  Which is why I thought maybe we had
[37:22.500 --> 37:24.540]  discussed it in the past, Gavin.
[37:24.600 --> 37:26.740]  Maybe personally. I can't remember anything about it.
[37:27.240 --> 37:28.580]  All I'm going to say about this film
[37:29.580 --> 37:30.560]  is if you
[37:30.560 --> 37:32.620]  ever, and I think this is good life advice in general,
[37:32.620 --> 37:34.820]  if you ever drop a glove
[37:34.820 --> 37:36.000]  at a museum,
[37:36.380 --> 37:38.240]  like you're wearing gloves, like
[37:38.240 --> 37:40.160]  isotoners, specifically in this instance,
[37:40.360 --> 37:42.620]  and one of them falls, and then you realize you dropped your
[37:42.620 --> 37:44.420]  glove and you go back for it, you will
[37:44.420 --> 37:46.420]  end up getting a venereal disease, and
[37:46.420 --> 37:47.820]  then you will be like...
[37:47.820 --> 37:50.860]  So if you drop a glove at a museum,
[37:51.320 --> 37:52.040]  leave it.
[37:53.140 --> 37:54.800]  Museums just became way more high stakes.
[37:54.940 --> 37:56.620]  Yeah, there you go. That's
[37:56.620 --> 37:58.100]  Dressed to Kill and Angel Heart.
[37:58.600 --> 38:00.700]  Angel Heart, tough to watch if you like
[38:00.700 --> 38:02.640]  chickens, tough to watch if you don't like chickens,
[38:03.340 --> 38:04.440]  and then Dressed to Kill,
[38:04.640 --> 38:05.820]  let the glove go.
[38:06.560 --> 38:07.580]  You'll die with the disease.
[38:08.320 --> 38:10.680]  I'm very torn on this chicken thing, because
[38:10.680 --> 38:12.780]  I love chicken. I consider myself a
[38:12.780 --> 38:14.840]  huge chicken guy, but mainly because of
[38:14.840 --> 38:16.740]  what they taste like in eating them,
[38:17.040 --> 38:18.700]  and I don't know if that means I like or
[38:18.700 --> 38:20.680]  dislike chickens. I'm not sure how
[38:20.680 --> 38:22.580]  to evaluate this. Wait, you think you would
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.780]  dislike the taste if you liked chickens
[38:24.780 --> 38:26.760]  more? Well, I just, I don't know
[38:26.760 --> 38:28.880]  how I feel. Can I say I like chickens
[38:28.880 --> 38:30.800]  when I like chickens because I eat
[38:30.800 --> 38:32.920]  chickens a lot? I consume a lot
[38:32.920 --> 38:34.520]  of chicken. Yeah. So,
[38:34.940 --> 38:36.800]  okay, so I'm pro-chick, even though that's
[38:36.800 --> 38:38.720]  against the chicken. From the chicken's
[38:38.720 --> 38:40.820]  perspective, they would hate me. Well, I mean, I
[38:40.820 --> 38:42.820]  would say the average person could say, well, I eat a lot
[38:42.820 --> 38:44.840]  of eggs, right, and that's something that a chicken provides, but
[38:44.840 --> 38:46.860]  you're not an egg guy. That's a great point!
[38:47.100 --> 38:48.780]  I've balanced it out. I'm not
[38:48.780 --> 38:50.880]  an egg guy. I think we're, yeah,
[38:51.060 --> 38:52.780]  that's a great, thanks Geoff. What classes
[38:52.780 --> 38:54.480]  a movie as problematic?
[38:54.980 --> 38:56.640]  Is it when...
[38:56.640 --> 38:56.860]  What?
[39:00.600 --> 39:01.160]  Well...
[39:01.160 --> 39:04.500]  This is a bad combination of words!
[39:04.900 --> 39:06.740]  Well, here's the thing, right? Is it when
[39:06.740 --> 39:08.700]  the good guy does something that's shitty by
[39:08.700 --> 39:10.680]  today's standards? Because surely the bad
[39:10.680 --> 39:12.660]  guy, like, murdering
[39:12.660 --> 39:14.660]  people's bad, right? But that still
[39:14.660 --> 39:15.600]  happens in movies today.
[39:16.420 --> 39:18.260]  In the specific
[39:18.260 --> 39:20.020]  case of Dressed to Kill,
[39:20.460 --> 39:22.120]  I could explain it,
[39:22.600 --> 39:24.420]  but it would spoil
[39:24.420 --> 39:26.020]  the secret of the movie.
[39:27.040 --> 39:28.200]  Like, this is kind of the secret
[39:28.200 --> 39:30.040]  point of the movie is why it's problematic.
[39:30.600 --> 39:32.580]  But I'll tell you that, like, the way they treat
[39:32.580 --> 39:34.500]  it, the way the good people
[39:34.500 --> 39:36.300]  in the movie treat it, is also
[39:36.300 --> 39:38.500]  problematic. I'll say that. Interesting.
[39:39.180 --> 39:40.500]  Yeah. And then Angel
[39:40.500 --> 39:42.560]  Heart, Angel Heart's just, it's just
[39:42.560 --> 39:44.400]  a movie that takes place in Brooklyn and
[39:44.400 --> 39:46.440]  New York in the 1940s, so it's just
[39:46.440 --> 39:48.080]  pure racism constantly.
[39:48.760 --> 39:49.800]  Yeah. Yeah.
[39:50.940 --> 39:52.520]  Yeah, I don't think it's even, like, character
[39:52.520 --> 39:54.640]  specific. I think it's almost, like, an idea of
[39:54.640 --> 39:56.680]  handling a subject
[39:56.680 --> 39:58.480]  irresponsibly on a platform
[39:58.480 --> 40:00.480]  that is large. It's...
[40:00.480 --> 40:02.560]  It's funny, too, because you
[40:02.560 --> 40:04.380]  can tell in the watching of Dressed to Kill
[40:04.380 --> 40:06.940]  that they think they're handling the subject
[40:08.140 --> 40:08.700]  properly,
[40:08.700 --> 40:10.320]  and maybe they were for
[40:10.320 --> 40:12.300]  1980, given sensibilities then,
[40:12.440 --> 40:13.560]  but it hasn't aged well.
[40:14.360 --> 40:16.480]  I would love to go back and
[40:16.480 --> 40:18.820]  read IMDB reviews
[40:18.820 --> 40:20.500]  of stuff, because some of those
[40:20.500 --> 40:22.260]  reviews are, like, 20 years old.
[40:22.540 --> 40:24.480]  Like, I think it'd be fascinating to go back to
[40:24.480 --> 40:26.420]  a movie like Chasing
[40:26.420 --> 40:28.500]  Amy or something, and read the reviews when
[40:28.500 --> 40:30.660]  it just came out, compared to reading the reviews
[40:30.660 --> 40:32.220]  now. I bet they'd be pretty different.
[40:32.760 --> 40:34.400]  Oh, for sure, for sure. I'm listening
[40:34.400 --> 40:36.600]  to... there's this podcast I listen to
[40:36.600 --> 40:37.880]  called You Must Remember This,
[40:38.440 --> 40:39.920]  and it's this lady who
[40:41.100 --> 40:42.440]  uncovers, like, the secret
[40:42.440 --> 40:44.480]  histories of Hollywood's first 100
[40:44.480 --> 40:46.560]  years, and so it's, like, the stories
[40:46.560 --> 40:48.440]  behind the stories. She's doing
[40:48.440 --> 40:50.920]  a series right now called Erotic 80s,
[40:51.200 --> 40:52.540]  and so she's going through, and
[40:52.540 --> 40:54.440]  right now, the episode I just listened to
[40:54.440 --> 40:56.440]  was all about Pretty Woman, and
[40:56.440 --> 40:58.620]  what a phenomenon that movie was
[40:58.620 --> 41:00.460]  that launched the career
[41:01.080 --> 41:02.400]  of Julia Roberts,
[41:02.700 --> 41:04.620]  and was seen as this very
[41:04.620 --> 41:06.600]  empowering love story, and it has
[41:06.600 --> 41:08.160]  not aged particularly well.
[41:08.720 --> 41:10.700]  And you get to hear, like, the reviews
[41:10.700 --> 41:12.520]  of... she reads the reviews of it from,
[41:12.540 --> 41:14.620]  like, the magazines at the time,
[41:14.680 --> 41:16.460]  and then discusses, like, how
[41:16.460 --> 41:18.640]  the view has changed
[41:18.640 --> 41:20.400]  over time, and how
[41:20.400 --> 41:22.620]  it hasn't. It's fascinating
[41:22.620 --> 41:24.140]  if you're into that kind of thing.
[41:24.300 --> 41:26.560]  It's the same with, like, when you watch Sleepless in Seattle
[41:26.560 --> 41:28.500]  or something, like, Bill Pullman's
[41:28.500 --> 41:30.080]  character is, like, the dweeb
[41:30.080 --> 41:32.400]  who she, like, wants nothing
[41:32.400 --> 41:34.500]  to do with, but he's the only good person in the
[41:34.500 --> 41:36.740]  movie, and she's, like, a crazy stalker
[41:36.740 --> 41:38.480]  person, and Tom Hanks is also terrible.
[41:38.620 --> 41:40.540]  Like, the two main... the two, like, heroes of the
[41:40.540 --> 41:42.400]  movie are just she. They're just
[41:42.400 --> 41:44.520]  awful. But I'm sure when it came
[41:44.520 --> 41:46.280]  out, it was fine. Yeah. Yeah.
[41:46.680 --> 41:48.640]  Like, contextually change it. You know what's weird about Chasing
[41:48.640 --> 41:50.460]  Amy is that there are trading cards
[41:50.460 --> 41:52.240]  for that movie. Oh! We should get some.
[41:52.980 --> 41:54.320]  I don't know if they're out.
[41:54.480 --> 41:56.080]  They got announced in, like, 2019,
[41:56.560 --> 41:58.500]  and they consistently seem to get
[41:58.500 --> 42:00.560]  pushed, but I just... I think it's such
[42:00.560 --> 42:02.700]  a weird thing to release
[42:02.700 --> 42:04.440]  modern trading cards for Chasing
[42:04.440 --> 42:06.540]  Amy. There's, like, Chase autograph
[42:06.540 --> 42:08.600]  cards. Like, I just don't know who that is
[42:08.600 --> 42:10.420]  for. Like, obviously Kevin Smith fans, but
[42:10.420 --> 42:12.720]  it just is such a niche movie.
[42:12.720 --> 42:14.580]  I'll tell you who it's for. It's for me in
[42:15.000 --> 42:15.400]  1998.
[42:19.260 --> 42:20.940]  I just... the idea of having, like,
[42:21.000 --> 42:22.320]  a Ben Affleck auto
[42:22.320 --> 42:24.420]  for Chasing Amy is really funny to me.
[42:24.780 --> 42:26.520]  What year was that? Because all those movies got
[42:27.400 --> 42:28.600]  turbo-Weinsteined, didn't they?
[42:29.200 --> 42:30.660]  Yeah. Probably, like, 99
[42:30.660 --> 42:32.800]  or so, I would think.
[42:33.380 --> 42:34.900]  No, I mean, like, when did the cards come out?
[42:35.400 --> 42:36.320]  Oh, they haven't yet.
[42:36.520 --> 42:38.440]  I don't think they've released yet.
[42:38.860 --> 42:40.600]  I think they keep getting pushed back.
[42:41.420 --> 42:42.640]  I think it's pre-orders
[42:42.640 --> 42:44.740]  everywhere. Yeah, like, yeah, you can pre-order
[42:45.260 --> 42:46.120]  now, it says.
[42:46.500 --> 42:48.500]  Yeah, it's really strange. Like, I've never seen them
[42:48.500 --> 42:50.680]  available for sale, but they popped up on my radar
[42:50.680 --> 42:52.800]  in, like, 2019. That's a thank me later.
[42:53.700 --> 42:54.060]  Yeah.
[42:56.100 --> 42:56.700]  I had a
[42:56.700 --> 42:58.780]  great one of those recently that I'm very excited
[42:58.780 --> 43:00.840]  about. I set myself up in a prime position
[43:00.840 --> 43:02.680]  for a thank me later with, um,
[43:03.400 --> 43:04.960]  the guy that made Calvin and Hobbes
[43:04.960 --> 43:06.880]  is doing his first book since
[43:07.340 --> 43:08.840]  stopping there. Comes out in
[43:08.840 --> 43:10.600]  October. What is his name? Bill
[43:11.300 --> 43:11.740]  Watterson.
[43:12.140 --> 43:14.760]  Yeah. I've ordered that.
[43:14.860 --> 43:16.880]  It'll come in October. I'm definitely gonna forget.
[43:17.040 --> 43:18.860]  I'm so excited to just randomly get that
[43:18.860 --> 43:20.340]  book in October. It's gonna be great.
[43:20.880 --> 43:22.760]  You'll thank you later. I will.
[43:23.200 --> 43:24.780]  I had a weird thing happen. Not a weird
[43:24.780 --> 43:26.780]  thing. I've been doing a weird thing
[43:26.780 --> 43:28.900]  and it's made me think about weird things.
[43:28.900 --> 43:30.840]  If you have things that...
[43:37.110 --> 43:38.190]  Eric said no way.
[43:39.850 --> 43:40.490]  I will
[43:40.490 --> 43:42.430]  say that there was recently a poll
[43:42.430 --> 43:44.510]  on the F*** Face Twitter account of who is
[43:44.510 --> 43:46.550]  the weird one after the whole argument of
[43:46.950 --> 43:48.410]  I think we had that debate.
[43:48.570 --> 43:49.410]  Where did that come from?
[43:49.850 --> 43:52.390]  I would like a recount because mine was not
[43:52.390 --> 43:54.550]  high enough. I won with like 67%
[43:54.550 --> 43:55.870]  of the vote I should have had higher.
[43:56.350 --> 43:58.510]  As the weird one? Yeah, as the weird
[43:58.510 --> 43:59.830]  one. I definitely more than that.
[44:00.070 --> 44:02.290]  We're pushing against you being the weird one.
[44:02.750 --> 44:04.570]  That was... Oh, I'm definitely more weird
[44:04.570 --> 44:05.630]  than you are. But anyway,
[44:07.310 --> 44:08.450]  weirdness... I was an
[44:08.450 --> 44:10.390]  unfortunate way of phrasing that. I really regret
[44:10.390 --> 44:12.470]  this entire angle that I've gone through. Anyway,
[44:13.970 --> 44:14.410]  I
[44:14.410 --> 44:16.570]  had a thing that it has become normalized
[44:17.330 --> 44:17.770]  where
[44:18.310 --> 44:20.390]  I have a pack... I don't even know how to explain
[44:20.390 --> 44:22.310]  this. I have a bag of... You know
[44:22.310 --> 44:24.370]  gingerbread houses? Have you heard of those?
[44:24.530 --> 44:26.390]  Yeah. I had one of those and
[44:26.390 --> 44:28.470]  I never make them. But I opened it
[44:28.470 --> 44:30.350]  up and so I just ended up with
[44:30.350 --> 44:32.570]  a bag of icing on my
[44:32.570 --> 44:33.650]  bedside table.
[44:34.150 --> 44:35.990]  And it's been there since November
[44:35.990 --> 44:37.970]  and it has turned into my
[44:37.970 --> 44:39.750]  ice pack when I need an ice pack.
[44:39.850 --> 44:41.870]  It's like whenever I have a really bad headache,
[44:42.150 --> 44:44.130]  I just grab my bag of icing
[44:44.130 --> 44:45.510]  because it's cold
[44:45.510 --> 44:47.990]  and I put that on my head. It's cold
[44:47.990 --> 44:50.050]  just from being in the room? It's cold
[44:50.050 --> 44:52.110]  from just being in the room. It's become my
[44:52.110 --> 44:53.370]  reusable ice pack.
[44:54.230 --> 44:55.970]  And I never thought about how
[44:55.970 --> 44:57.950]  odd it is that I'm using a bag of
[44:57.950 --> 44:59.610]  icing from a gingerbread house
[44:59.610 --> 45:01.930]  as an ice pack. So
[45:01.930 --> 45:04.110]  I was curious if you guys had things
[45:04.110 --> 45:06.070]  that you, like, when you
[45:06.070 --> 45:08.130]  take a step back, you realize, oh, this is odd.
[45:08.270 --> 45:09.970]  Well, I have a question for you. But I'm curious how it happens.
[45:10.170 --> 45:12.170]  Yeah, go ahead. Have you considered using an ice
[45:12.170 --> 45:13.830]  pack? Uh, well,
[45:13.950 --> 45:15.970]  that often is
[45:15.970 --> 45:18.170]  in my little fridge and if I'm in bed
[45:18.170 --> 45:20.110]  and I'm comfortable, but I have a headache
[45:20.110 --> 45:22.110]  or something... Oh, but the icing is always
[45:22.110 --> 45:24.130]  within arm's reach. The icing is always
[45:24.130 --> 45:26.090]  within arm's reach. So I
[45:26.090 --> 45:27.750]  just grab it and it works great.
[45:28.010 --> 45:30.050]  I use it on one side, then it heats
[45:30.050 --> 45:32.010]  up and then I flip it over and it's cooling
[45:32.010 --> 45:33.970]  in and then I'm probably good
[45:33.970 --> 45:35.110]  by the time it reheats.
[45:35.970 --> 45:39.630]  Why is the icing there?
[45:40.590 --> 45:41.970]  Because I opened
[45:41.970 --> 45:43.930]  it in my bedroom and
[45:43.930 --> 45:46.030]  I just, I left it on the
[45:46.030 --> 45:47.990]  bedside table. Like, I put,
[45:48.070 --> 45:49.970]  I never built the set. It's still,
[45:50.370 --> 45:52.050]  the gingerbread is still wrapped up
[45:52.050 --> 45:54.090]  in my closet and the
[45:54.090 --> 45:55.950]  icing just ended up on my end table
[45:56.710 --> 45:58.030]  and one day when
[45:58.030 --> 46:00.050]  I was having a headache, like, I kind of felt like I was
[46:00.050 --> 46:01.850]  fighting a fever or something, I was like,
[46:01.890 --> 46:04.210]  oh fuck, I have this, I'll just put this, this feels cold
[46:04.210 --> 46:06.130]  and I've used it ever since.
[46:06.250 --> 46:08.050]  I've been using this for like three months now.
[46:08.510 --> 46:10.050]  But it just occurred to me that
[46:10.050 --> 46:11.290]  this is an odd thing.
[46:12.710 --> 46:14.110]  I was like, this is strange.
[46:14.230 --> 46:16.030]  I'm taking a step back. It is, I don't think
[46:16.030 --> 46:17.930]  there are many people using bags of
[46:17.930 --> 46:19.770]  gingerbread icing for
[46:19.770 --> 46:20.510]  ice packs.
[46:21.670 --> 46:23.950]  So this is curious, if you guys had anything, if you
[46:23.950 --> 46:25.070]  take a step back,
[46:25.810 --> 46:27.430]  maybe had a natural lead in
[46:27.830 --> 46:29.290]  to it, or a thing, like
[46:29.290 --> 46:31.350]  it makes, it's how you got there. I don't think
[46:31.350 --> 46:33.230]  I made any weird choices along the way.
[46:33.850 --> 46:35.370]  I just... I think it was a pretty weird
[46:35.370 --> 46:37.430]  choice the first time you picked it up and put it on your
[46:37.430 --> 46:39.250]  head. Yeah. Well, no, I
[46:39.250 --> 46:41.470]  was feeling awful and I was like, I need
[46:41.470 --> 46:43.490]  to cool down somehow, what can I do?
[46:44.010 --> 46:45.450]  And I just grabbed that. I don't think
[46:45.450 --> 46:47.370]  I had an ice pack in my room at that time.
[46:48.290 --> 46:49.410]  Hmm. So you were
[46:49.410 --> 46:51.270]  being resourceful and
[46:51.270 --> 46:53.270]  you discovered a method that works
[46:53.270 --> 46:55.210]  so well, you've eliminated
[46:55.210 --> 46:57.330]  the need to re-freeze
[46:57.330 --> 46:58.690]  your ice pack. Yes.
[46:59.250 --> 47:01.370]  The fact that it works at room temperature... I like
[47:01.370 --> 47:02.370]  to keep my room very cold.
[47:03.290 --> 47:05.350]  I'm a cold room guy. Let me ask you this.
[47:05.630 --> 47:07.150]  Do you anticipate ever
[47:07.150 --> 47:09.090]  eating the frosting? Or the icing?
[47:09.090 --> 47:11.150]  No. No. So it's...
[47:11.150 --> 47:13.190]  I think... I made that...
[47:13.190 --> 47:15.030]  I had that thought. I think it is
[47:15.030 --> 47:16.870]  more useful to me as an ice pack
[47:16.870 --> 47:18.670]  than it is a food to consume.
[47:19.750 --> 47:19.990]  You think?
[47:20.970 --> 47:22.670]  When is icing useful?
[47:22.670 --> 47:24.730]  Whenever I have a headache or I feel
[47:24.730 --> 47:26.710]  too hot. I don't think that's what he meant.
[47:26.870 --> 47:28.670]  I don't...
[47:31.870 --> 47:32.730]  Whatever you need
[47:32.730 --> 47:34.970]  to build a gingerbread house...
[47:34.970 --> 47:36.830]  If you removed icing from the world
[47:36.830 --> 47:38.890]  it might be the least impactful thing.
[47:39.250 --> 47:40.790]  Oh, I think you get very
[47:40.790 --> 47:42.550]  underrating icing. The least
[47:42.550 --> 47:44.710]  impactful? No. It's only ever
[47:44.710 --> 47:46.290]  on top of what you want to eat.
[47:46.810 --> 47:48.490]  We got this fucking
[47:48.490 --> 47:50.670]  Branston Mouse son of a bitch talking
[47:50.670 --> 47:52.850]  down to icing. Dude, if I get a choice
[47:52.850 --> 47:54.410]  between eating a cake
[47:54.410 --> 47:56.530]  or the icing that goes on a cake
[47:56.530 --> 47:58.690]  I'm eating the icing that goes on a cake and throwing the
[47:58.690 --> 48:00.670]  cake away. Oh, we should eat more cakes
[48:00.670 --> 48:02.830]  together because I always just smear the icing
[48:02.830 --> 48:04.550]  off the top so I can eat the cake. Yes.
[48:04.630 --> 48:06.470]  Let's only eat our cakes together from here.
[48:08.510 --> 48:10.830]  I hate the fact that you would rank
[48:10.830 --> 48:12.250]  the pickled onion above icing.
[48:12.870 --> 48:14.750]  That's terrible. Well, the pickled onion is
[48:14.750 --> 48:16.730]  like... it's more centered in what
[48:16.730 --> 48:18.590]  you're eating. I don't want
[48:18.590 --> 48:19.530]  the pickled onion though.
[48:20.570 --> 48:22.310]  That's just something you don't like.
[48:23.150 --> 48:24.570]  Yeah, but I think I'm not in the minority
[48:24.570 --> 48:26.410]  in that. I think a lot more people prefer
[48:26.410 --> 48:28.590]  icing than the pickled onion. That's like saying, oh, let's get rid
[48:28.590 --> 48:29.930]  of lava. I'd never use it.
[48:30.750 --> 48:32.750]  No, shut up. No, they're both food.
[48:33.110 --> 48:34.110]  Let's not look at it at all.
[48:34.810 --> 48:36.170]  You're saying least impactful.
[48:36.410 --> 48:38.550]  I'm saying that I think getting rid
[48:38.550 --> 48:40.530]  of pickled onion is less impactful
[48:40.530 --> 48:42.570]  than icing. I think there are way more people
[48:42.570 --> 48:44.410]  that like icing than pickled onion. But with
[48:44.410 --> 48:46.450]  icing gone, you still have the thing
[48:46.450 --> 48:48.290]  that the icing is on. If pickled onion's
[48:48.290 --> 48:49.570]  gone, what have you got in your hand?
[48:50.050 --> 48:52.370]  I don't need the pickled onion. I don't care
[48:52.370 --> 48:54.410]  about the fact that I have a shitty cake without icing.
[48:54.710 --> 48:55.650]  Geoff, did you say onion?
[48:56.770 --> 48:58.370]  Onion. The pickled onion's gone.
[48:59.790 --> 49:00.510]  No, but you still have
[49:00.510 --> 49:02.150]  an onion. It's just not pickled.
[49:02.510 --> 49:04.450]  Yeah, but you have a pickle in one hand and an onion
[49:04.450 --> 49:06.450]  in the other. So you're just fine. You're pickling it.
[49:06.830 --> 49:08.470]  Okay. Yeah, you're just getting rid of the pickled
[49:08.470 --> 49:10.310]  onion. Why would getting rid of pickled onion
[49:10.310 --> 49:12.290]  get rid of all onion? That's ridiculous.
[49:12.910 --> 49:14.430]  It would be like thinking that getting rid of
[49:14.430 --> 49:16.590]  icing is getting rid of all sugar. What are you saying?
[49:16.790 --> 49:18.350]  Speaking of pickled onion...
[49:20.130 --> 49:22.370]  Because somebody refused to do their
[49:22.370 --> 49:24.630]  plowman's pizza recipe, I spent
[49:24.630 --> 49:26.230]  yesterday at my
[49:26.230 --> 49:28.510]  coffee shop, I spent about two
[49:28.510 --> 49:30.450]  hours watching the
[49:30.450 --> 49:32.290]  pizza day video over
[49:32.290 --> 49:34.330]  and over. I probably watched it
[49:34.330 --> 49:35.970]  four times. It's
[49:35.970 --> 49:37.970]  27 minutes long, I want to say.
[49:38.310 --> 49:40.210]  So I watched about two hours
[49:40.210 --> 49:42.710]  of it so that I could write the plowman's
[49:42.710 --> 49:44.010]  recipe, which I think I did a lovely
[49:44.590 --> 49:46.470]  job of. And now the cookbook is done.
[49:46.810 --> 49:48.470]  Tony's laying it out. That's so exciting.
[49:48.470 --> 49:50.810]  I only contributed the plowman's...
[49:50.810 --> 49:51.470]  What did I do again?
[49:51.970 --> 49:54.610]  You did stuff. You did stuff. You did stuff. You did like your
[49:54.610 --> 49:56.630]  cold sandwich, did the plowman's pizza.
[49:57.490 --> 49:58.790]  You have a salad in there.
[49:58.870 --> 49:59.730]  You've got lots of stuff.
[50:00.610 --> 50:02.630]  Everybody's represented. You did, and it's a really
[50:02.630 --> 50:04.470]  really good recipe. It's actually...
[50:04.470 --> 50:06.090]  I don't want to play favorites, but it's
[50:06.090 --> 50:08.610]  one of the best in the book. Oh, sick.
[50:09.230 --> 50:10.710]  Yeah, then I just forgot to do
[50:10.710 --> 50:12.750]  the pizza one. It's 55 pages,
[50:12.810 --> 50:14.670]  it looks like. Holy shit.
[50:15.350 --> 50:16.610]  Yeah, 55 pages of recipes.
[50:16.730 --> 50:18.630]  I still have to write the end, and
[50:18.630 --> 50:20.350]  that's gonna hopefully be
[50:20.350 --> 50:22.390]  7 or 8 pages by itself, but we'll see.
[50:22.790 --> 50:24.370]  I'm excited to see how that turns out.
[50:24.510 --> 50:26.570]  Me too. Anyway, I can't imagine
[50:26.570 --> 50:28.570]  it'll find its way to shelves
[50:28.570 --> 50:30.770]  anytime soon. We still have to lay it out
[50:30.770 --> 50:32.730]  and then it takes a billion years to get a book printed,
[50:32.910 --> 50:34.690]  but it is... Progress
[50:34.690 --> 50:36.730]  is underway. I have a...
[50:36.730 --> 50:38.690]  I have an idea that I've already talked
[50:38.690 --> 50:40.950]  to Tony about. I was curious to see
[50:40.950 --> 50:42.990]  what you guys thought. I need to pitch this to you.
[50:43.670 --> 50:44.290]  So I was...
[50:44.290 --> 50:46.850]  I was thinking about... I love the Gerpler
[50:46.850 --> 50:48.710]  so much. I use my Gerpler all the
[50:48.710 --> 50:50.890]  time. And then I was just thinking
[50:50.890 --> 50:52.910]  of all the dumb stuff
[50:52.910 --> 50:54.670]  we've released and how great... that we could
[50:54.670 --> 50:56.630]  have a switch fuck. And that
[50:56.630 --> 50:58.250]  exists. We've got the mini bats and
[50:58.250 --> 51:00.830]  all that dumb shit. How lucky it is
[51:00.830 --> 51:02.750]  that we have the ability
[51:02.750 --> 51:04.770]  to essentially make whatever we
[51:04.770 --> 51:06.790]  want. And it's just like...
[51:06.790 --> 51:08.710]  And Tony's so great at coming up and mocking things.
[51:08.770 --> 51:10.870]  I was thinking about when I was doing the anal passage website.
[51:11.130 --> 51:12.650]  All the stuff he mocked up.
[51:13.250 --> 51:14.690]  And just how... I feel like
[51:14.690 --> 51:16.710]  we're in a position that we're not fully utilizing
[51:16.710 --> 51:18.650]  where we essentially could
[51:18.650 --> 51:20.890]  attempt to create at least an iteration
[51:21.330 --> 51:22.710]  of whatever we wanted.
[51:23.530 --> 51:24.950]  And so I wanted... I had an idea
[51:24.950 --> 51:26.390]  of what if we all
[51:26.830 --> 51:28.670]  came up with what we would...
[51:28.670 --> 51:30.790]  just our own... like what is a product that is
[51:30.790 --> 51:32.590]  not in the world or a thing that we want
[51:32.590 --> 51:34.070]  that doesn't exist?
[51:34.590 --> 51:36.230]  At least in the way we want it.
[51:36.690 --> 51:38.390]  And then we pitch them to each other.
[51:38.510 --> 51:40.190]  We present them. We talk to Tony
[51:40.190 --> 51:42.270]  independently, all of us, about what we would
[51:42.270 --> 51:44.330]  like. And then we get a finalized
[51:44.330 --> 51:46.390]  thing. And then we present the products
[51:46.390 --> 51:48.270]  to each other of what our ideal product
[51:48.270 --> 51:50.430]  would be. So it's the next round of Unifar.
[51:51.310 --> 51:52.050]  Sort of, yeah.
[51:52.110 --> 51:54.390]  Almost like a Unifar thing. I'm not going to claim that it's a Unifar
[51:54.390 --> 51:55.750]  thing because that's a Geoff
[51:56.270 --> 51:58.230]  design. I'm not going to say that this
[51:58.230 --> 52:00.270]  is a Unifar line. But just
[52:00.270 --> 52:02.050]  the idea of the
[52:02.050 --> 52:04.010]  ability to make whatever you want is such a
[52:04.010 --> 52:05.570]  privileged position we have.
[52:05.950 --> 52:08.090]  And there are some dumb things that I would love
[52:08.090 --> 52:09.410]  to have that just don't exist
[52:10.110 --> 52:12.090]  in the world. So we're trying to
[52:12.090 --> 52:14.090]  create new objects.
[52:14.630 --> 52:16.090]  Yeah, so all three of us would
[52:16.090 --> 52:18.070]  talk to Tony. And this is going to take a really
[52:18.070 --> 52:20.130]  long time from when we initially discuss
[52:20.130 --> 52:22.170]  it to it becoming an actual thing
[52:22.170 --> 52:23.950]  that could be purchasable. But
[52:23.950 --> 52:26.250]  yeah, the idea is we all would talk to Tony independently
[52:26.250 --> 52:28.010]  about what we'd want. And then once it
[52:28.010 --> 52:29.890]  becomes kind of like a finalized thing,
[52:29.890 --> 52:32.010]  we present it to each other on the show
[52:32.010 --> 52:34.030]  of what our products would be.
[52:34.810 --> 52:36.050]  Geoff's going apeshit in the chat.
[52:36.430 --> 52:38.130]  Oh, I just keep posting the wrong photos.
[52:38.690 --> 52:39.850]  I thought the same thing.
[52:39.890 --> 52:41.970]  I thought that was a pipe. I thought it was a tiny little
[52:41.970 --> 52:43.890]  bubble-blowing pipe.
[52:44.610 --> 52:45.910]  No, I just figured while Andrew was
[52:45.910 --> 52:48.030]  talking about the Gerpler, I was just
[52:48.030 --> 52:50.010]  preloading this. Some pictures I took
[52:50.010 --> 52:50.610]  of the Gerpler
[52:51.990 --> 52:53.670]  the other day. The point is,
[52:53.750 --> 52:56.170]  I think it's a great idea, Andrew, and I'm on board. Just let me know
[52:56.170 --> 52:57.870]  when and where to be and how to do it.
[52:58.990 --> 52:59.710]  That's great.
[53:01.390 --> 53:01.970]  Here's something
[53:01.970 --> 53:03.990]  complicated. Yeah, just you fucking figure
[53:03.990 --> 53:05.290]  it out. You got it. Let me know.
[53:06.950 --> 53:07.910]  I come up with
[53:07.910 --> 53:10.030]  bullshit and give it to Tony and he makes it? We can do that.
[53:10.750 --> 53:11.950]  No, I think it's a great idea.
[53:12.570 --> 53:13.830]  We have to invent products from the ground up.
[53:13.910 --> 53:15.710]  Yeah, whatever, man. Just kind of like, I don't know,
[53:15.770 --> 53:16.990]  is it like a Tuesday or Wednesday or whatever?
[53:16.990 --> 53:19.850]  Dude, inventing products from the ground up
[53:19.850 --> 53:21.830]  is what I do. I'm all
[53:21.830 --> 53:23.870]  about it. For instance, did
[53:23.870 --> 53:25.950]  you know that the Gerpler is not just
[53:25.950 --> 53:27.750]  the premier drinking
[53:27.750 --> 53:29.570]  vessel for humans
[53:30.310 --> 53:31.990]  throughout the world? It also
[53:31.990 --> 53:33.870]  casts a really long red
[53:33.870 --> 53:34.630]  boner shadow.
[53:36.990 --> 53:37.870]  Now, Geoff
[53:37.870 --> 53:39.710]  sent me these photos over the weekend.
[53:39.830 --> 53:41.910]  He texted me these images and I
[53:41.910 --> 53:43.810]  love them. They're great. I think these are great.
[53:43.970 --> 53:45.790]  I had the realization, I think these are the best
[53:45.790 --> 53:47.450]  photos Geoff has ever taken. Shut the fuck up.
[53:48.210 --> 53:49.690]  I was going to compliment the composition
[53:49.690 --> 53:51.850]  on them, yeah. Yeah, they look great.
[53:51.930 --> 53:53.730]  Like, these should be in the store page for
[53:53.730 --> 53:55.650]  the product. I woke up the other morning
[53:55.650 --> 53:57.250]  and the Gerpler, I had left it
[53:57.250 --> 53:59.990]  on the counter and it was like 7am
[53:59.990 --> 54:01.690]  and the sun had hit the window just
[54:01.690 --> 54:03.650]  right. And it just made this long
[54:03.650 --> 54:05.790]  red reflection of the
[54:05.790 --> 54:07.910]  Gerpler down my countertop
[54:07.910 --> 54:09.150]  and I just thought like, wow, that's
[54:09.750 --> 54:11.670]  another benefit that the Gerpler has. I didn't even
[54:11.670 --> 54:13.330]  think about it. It casts a really cool shadow.
[54:13.930 --> 54:15.670]  And I was talking to Tony about it because, you know, we have
[54:15.670 --> 54:17.490]  the purple and the green Gerpler
[54:17.490 --> 54:19.690]  coming out and I asked
[54:19.690 --> 54:21.710]  him if there's a way we can manipulate the lighting
[54:21.710 --> 54:23.570]  so that we have them cross
[54:23.570 --> 54:25.490]  and then that creates Gerple.
[54:27.910 --> 54:29.270]  Oh, that's amazing.
[54:29.670 --> 54:31.790]  Right? So we're going to create, we're going to have
[54:31.790 --> 54:33.730]  them, we're going to get on it, we're going to figure out
[54:33.730 --> 54:35.890]  a way with Wes or whoever and we're going to
[54:35.890 --> 54:37.470]  recreate what I've done here
[54:37.470 --> 54:39.650]  but with the green and purple and create
[54:39.650 --> 54:41.770]  Gerple in the middle. Do you think if we put
[54:41.770 --> 54:43.670]  a green or
[54:43.670 --> 54:45.730]  if we put both colors on either side of the
[54:45.730 --> 54:47.630]  roof of your house, Geoff, and when the sun
[54:47.630 --> 54:49.290]  shines and they cross
[54:49.930 --> 54:51.030]  that's where we dig?
[54:52.390 --> 54:53.450]  That's a great
[54:53.450 --> 54:55.410]  idea. I love that idea.
[54:56.170 --> 54:57.410]  That's such a great idea.
[54:57.570 --> 54:59.430]  You're going Indiana Jones with it. I thought you were going
[54:59.430 --> 55:01.070]  Batman and we were making like a GERP signal.
[55:01.390 --> 55:03.410]  I like your idea so much better. That's so
[55:03.410 --> 55:05.350]  good. Oh my god. Although I think technically
[55:05.350 --> 55:07.370]  for them to cross we would need two suns.
[55:09.390 --> 55:10.350]  Might not work.
[55:12.290 --> 55:13.310]  You figure it out.
[55:13.550 --> 55:15.070]  We'll figure it out. Somebody on Geoff's roof with a
[55:15.070 --> 55:17.390]  flashlight and you're set. Flashlight
[55:17.390 --> 55:19.090]  and the sun. We just need a sun and a mirror.
[55:23.530 --> 55:25.150]  Anyway, I love your idea, Andrew.
[55:25.310 --> 55:27.470]  We got all this stuff, just so you guys are aware,
[55:27.610 --> 55:28.990]  we got all this stuff for
[55:30.530 --> 55:31.170]  what is it?
[55:31.470 --> 55:31.870]  The
[55:32.990 --> 55:35.230]  Gerpler, the Golden Gerpler, all
[55:35.230 --> 55:37.430]  that stuff. We just have to like find a time
[55:37.430 --> 55:39.230]  and make this.
[55:39.250 --> 55:41.270]  The sun coming through a nice golden
[55:41.270 --> 55:42.810]  GERP is going to look so nice.
[55:43.350 --> 55:45.110]  It's going to be beautiful. It's going to be really cool.
[55:46.250 --> 55:46.990]  Also, the
[55:46.990 --> 55:49.210]  little USB drives that contain the secret
[55:49.210 --> 55:51.050]  video are really nice in themselves.
[55:51.170 --> 55:51.850]  They're very cool.
[55:52.010 --> 55:53.550]  Very cool.
[55:53.910 --> 55:56.090]  We have to do...
[55:56.570 --> 55:59.050]  I'm really excited, I guess is what I'm saying.
[55:59.850 --> 56:01.150]  I'm very excited to see what
[56:01.150 --> 56:03.110]  happens and what we do
[56:03.110 --> 56:05.110]  next and what people are going to do with it.
[56:05.370 --> 56:07.110]  Because it's going to be...
[56:08.070 --> 56:08.870]  I don't know.
[56:09.150 --> 56:11.150]  It feels like what Andrew was
[56:11.150 --> 56:12.770]  saying. I'm sorry to get belabored about this, but
[56:12.770 --> 56:14.470]  it gets me really excited.
[56:14.650 --> 56:16.970]  We have a way to make
[56:16.970 --> 56:18.870]  whatever we want, and then when
[56:18.870 --> 56:20.370]  you see it come into fruition,
[56:20.890 --> 56:22.850]  it's so exciting to me
[56:22.850 --> 56:24.230]  to actually see...
[56:24.730 --> 56:26.370]  Oh, I thought we were just fucking around.
[56:26.530 --> 56:27.650]  It's like, oh no, this is real.
[56:29.070 --> 56:30.230]  It's very, very cool.
[56:31.290 --> 56:32.550]  We haven't discussed
[56:32.550 --> 56:34.410]  the stuff we saw
[56:34.410 --> 56:36.730]  with the audience yet, have we? We saw it the other day
[56:36.730 --> 56:37.590]  in Tony's office.
[56:38.090 --> 56:39.830]  Also, it's very cool.
[56:40.730 --> 56:41.770]  There's some stuff coming out
[56:41.770 --> 56:43.110]  that's going to... it's just fucking...
[56:43.110 --> 56:45.590]  I don't even know how to describe it. It's so ludicrous.
[56:45.730 --> 56:46.730]  It's very exciting.
[56:47.150 --> 56:49.070]  I also want to kind of
[56:49.570 --> 56:51.430]  double back to something Andrew said,
[56:51.490 --> 56:53.590]  where he said, these are the best pictures Geoff
[56:53.590 --> 56:54.230]  has ever taken.
[56:55.070 --> 56:57.590]  This is a picture that he took of Gus when we were doing
[56:57.590 --> 56:59.650]  an episode of The Ant Club. I think this picture
[56:59.650 --> 57:01.310]  is incredible. We've posted it before.
[57:01.430 --> 57:02.430]  I think it's really great.
[57:03.470 --> 57:05.570]  Geoff took this picture and showed it to me
[57:05.570 --> 57:07.730]  and I went, this is such a good
[57:07.730 --> 57:09.910]  fucking photo. What is wrong with you
[57:09.910 --> 57:11.010]  normally? And he went,
[57:11.190 --> 57:13.610]  I was a photographer for
[57:13.610 --> 57:15.910]  years. Yeah, we've already established
[57:15.910 --> 57:17.950]  he's a great photographer. It's insane
[57:17.950 --> 57:19.710]  that this can happen.
[57:21.210 --> 57:21.810]  There's...
[57:21.810 --> 57:23.790]  Listen, there's time to
[57:23.790 --> 57:25.770]  try and there's time
[57:25.770 --> 57:27.850]  not to try. I think it's
[57:27.850 --> 57:29.730]  less about when you want to try and
[57:29.730 --> 57:31.570]  more that watching you
[57:31.570 --> 57:33.610]  try and use an iPhone camera is
[57:33.610 --> 57:35.990]  very similar to watching my grandparents
[57:35.990 --> 57:38.070]  try to use it. I was gonna say
[57:38.070 --> 57:40.050]  I think the skill is there
[57:40.050 --> 57:41.890]  but it's lost
[57:41.890 --> 57:43.450]  in the use of the device
[57:43.450 --> 57:45.970]  so if you take enough photos, this is bound
[57:45.970 --> 57:46.890]  to happen.
[57:47.030 --> 57:49.830]  You give me a
[57:49.830 --> 57:50.930]  Canon F1
[57:51.830 --> 57:53.910]  and a roll of
[57:53.910 --> 57:56.170]  Ilford film and I'll fuck your world up.
[57:57.250 --> 57:57.710]  Fucking
[57:57.710 --> 57:59.570]  flat disc of a phone where
[57:59.570 --> 58:02.030]  everything I touch turns voice activation on
[58:02.030 --> 58:02.930]  and I have issues.
[58:07.790 --> 58:08.230]  I'm
[58:08.230 --> 58:09.690]  good to see it. It's happy to see it though.
[58:09.770 --> 58:11.490]  That's great. I feel like it's like
[58:11.490 --> 58:13.010]  the retired athlete
[58:13.870 --> 58:15.830]  still sinking a three from a distance.
[58:16.130 --> 58:17.130]  You still got it.
[58:17.430 --> 58:19.690]  The skills are maybe not fully there
[58:19.690 --> 58:21.650]  in the current world that we live in
[58:21.650 --> 58:24.090]  but it's there. There's something there.
[58:25.090 --> 58:26.030]  There's a root there.
[58:26.030 --> 58:27.850]  Yeah, you're like Ahmad
[58:27.850 --> 58:29.930]  Rashad where you just get him back out there
[58:29.930 --> 58:31.410]  and he can make something happen but
[58:31.890 --> 58:33.570]  most of the time, nope.
[58:34.490 --> 58:34.930]  Hey,
[58:35.570 --> 58:37.690]  we're doing the rock
[58:37.690 --> 58:39.730]  draft tomorrow, right? I believe
[58:39.730 --> 58:41.430]  so, yeah. I'm so excited for that.
[58:41.710 --> 58:42.810]  Are you really? Rock not rock?
[58:43.850 --> 58:45.130]  Fuck you, Gavin.
[58:45.410 --> 58:47.690]  Jesus Christ. Dude, I put
[58:47.690 --> 58:49.730]  so much work... I spent over two hours
[58:49.730 --> 58:51.750]  today working on my rock draft, getting it ready.
[58:52.290 --> 58:53.630]  And I was laughing
[58:53.630 --> 58:54.870]  the entire time.
[58:55.990 --> 58:57.690]  Who goes first? Is that what you're about
[58:57.690 --> 58:59.810]  to ask? Well, yeah, basically, who picks the rock?
[59:00.310 --> 59:01.850]  I think... What do you mean?
[59:01.850 --> 59:03.690]  Well, whoever goes first is clearly picking
[59:03.690 --> 59:05.210]  Dwayne Johnson. I know. No.
[59:05.510 --> 59:06.090]  I disagree.
[59:07.230 --> 59:09.770]  I'm going to be so bummed
[59:09.770 --> 59:11.170]  if any of you guys pick my rocks.
[59:11.730 --> 59:13.590]  Because I got... I did a
[59:13.590 --> 59:15.450]  presentation. I'm going to be serious with you.
[59:15.650 --> 59:17.970]  I did fucking fun facts
[59:17.970 --> 59:19.190]  for each rock.
[59:19.350 --> 59:21.610]  So I chose rocks that
[59:21.610 --> 59:23.170]  I don't think you guys will pick.
[59:24.230 --> 59:25.450]  So do we have the ability
[59:25.450 --> 59:27.790]  to display PowerPoints?
[59:28.130 --> 59:29.570]  I was going to share my screen with you all
[59:29.570 --> 59:31.010]  via Discord, I figured. Okay.
[59:31.750 --> 59:33.570]  Fantastic. I still need to come up with
[59:33.570 --> 59:34.770]  three other rocks, but then I'm ready.
[59:37.350 --> 59:39.450]  You come up with my rocks. We can talk
[59:39.450 --> 59:41.630]  about the rules of the rock draft
[59:41.630 --> 59:43.530]  when we actually do the rock draft, because I
[59:43.530 --> 59:45.530]  feel like that's probably where it's really going to land, and it's going to be
[59:45.530 --> 59:47.530]  a while before it's out, so there's not really a point
[59:47.530 --> 59:49.530]  here. However, and Andrew,
[59:49.550 --> 59:51.590]  I don't want to put you on the spot. You said there might be another
[59:51.590 --> 59:53.570]  draft you want to do? Is that something you want to talk about here
[59:53.570 --> 59:55.490]  or not? Sure, sure. I can talk
[59:55.490 --> 59:57.310]  about it here. I was going to explain it to you guys
[59:57.310 --> 59:58.910]  either pre-show or after.
[59:59.590 --> 01:00:01.330]  I was thinking about Geoff and malls,
[01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:03.290]  and I was thinking, like, Geoff
[01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:05.430]  loves malls, and if Geoff was
[01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:06.850]  in my town,
[01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:09.390]  what aspect of the mall do I
[01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:11.070]  think Geoff would most care about?
[01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:13.270]  Which then made me think, like, what if
[01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:15.310]  we all drafted like
[01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:17.230]  we were malls? Like, imagine we're all
[01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:19.250]  malls, and we're drafting mall stores.
[01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:21.290]  And then whoever has the
[01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:23.430]  best mall wins the draw. Like, that's what the audience
[01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:25.230]  would be voting on. That is awesome.
[01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:26.650]  Because you get four stores,
[01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:29.190]  but maybe not even stores, right? Four stores or
[01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:31.130]  four establishments
[01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:33.290]  within a mall to make the perfect mall.
[01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:35.210]  Is it aspects of the mall
[01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:37.350]  or is it, like, physical places
[01:00:37.350 --> 01:00:38.150]  within the mall?
[01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:41.270]  I think it's physical places, and I think it's
[01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:42.970]  not... you can't take, like, cafeteria.
[01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:44.830]  Like, you have to take a place within it.
[01:00:44.830 --> 01:00:47.050]  Like, you have to pick, like, Sbarro, if you're going to... okay, got it.
[01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:49.430]  Yes. Oh, man, I'm fucking set.
[01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:50.850]  I've already... I have two...
[01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:52.150]  Oh, it's going to be hard to whittle down.
[01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:54.170]  Oh, there's so many great malls.
[01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:56.290]  For me, I think there's a clear 1-1
[01:00:56.290 --> 01:00:58.430]  in my opinion of mall places, but that's,
[01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:00.150]  you know, it'll be interesting to see as well, because, like,
[01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:02.450]  when I think... Where is the mall located?
[01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:04.190]  Anywhere.
[01:01:04.570 --> 01:01:05.790]  It's just... it's your mall. It doesn't really matter.
[01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:08.170]  Can I be bringing in an English chain to my mall?
[01:01:08.170 --> 01:01:09.970]  I was about to ask that. Oh, you absolutely could.
[01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:12.230]  I was about to ask if Gavin is going to
[01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:13.810]  end up with a very British mall,
[01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:16.190]  it's going to be weird. Like, he's going to
[01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:18.130]  go, oh, yeah, Chumlees. And we're going to
[01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:18.650]  go, what?
[01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:19.030]  Yeah.
[01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:22.850]  But, I guess the price of that is, like,
[01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:24.650]  if you... you're potentially taking away
[01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:26.790]  votes, if, like, a smaller percentage of the audience
[01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:28.670]  doesn't know what you're talking about. Like, for me,
[01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:30.970]  Cafeteria New York Fries
[01:01:30.970 --> 01:01:32.330]  is a Canadian mall staple,
[01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:34.190]  but that is a Canadian thing. Like, I don't
[01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:36.510]  expect anyone to really know that. So,
[01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:38.570]  am I losing votes by putting that, even
[01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.630]  though, in my head, that is a definitive
[01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:41.330]  mall experience?
[01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:44.070]  I'm going to get working on this immediately.
[01:01:44.970 --> 01:01:46.650]  Oh, man. Do you know...
[01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:48.190]  Ah, shit, Andrew.
[01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:50.790]  What? You just gave me an idea.
[01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:52.450]  Oh, no. You just gave me an
[01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:54.670]  undoable idea. Oh, no.
[01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:56.650]  Does it do it? I'm sitting
[01:01:56.650 --> 01:01:57.130]  here...
[01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:00.470]  I'm sitting here in my head, trying to build,
[01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:02.510]  trying to lay my mall out, my four stores,
[01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:04.790]  how they would look next to each other, and then I realized
[01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:06.770]  what I need is a tiny town
[01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:08.570]  for malls. They should make,
[01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:10.590]  like, tiny town, but for
[01:02:10.590 --> 01:02:12.650]  mall stores, and then instead of making Christmas
[01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:14.350]  and Thanksgiving, or
[01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:16.430]  Halloween, you can build your own
[01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:18.550]  perfect fucking mall out of ceramic
[01:02:18.550 --> 01:02:19.230]  tiny towns.
[01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:22.470]  How do I do that? And if you had
[01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:24.270]  four, would you put them all in a line?
[01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:26.230]  Right, or how do you do it? Do you do, like, catty corner?
[01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:27.410]  Do you do, like... I don't know.
[01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:30.410]  Oh, man, I want to build a... I want a mall
[01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:31.050]  tiny town.
[01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:34.350]  Do you know... I mean, that probably
[01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:36.610]  doesn't exist, but do you definitively know?
[01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:38.730]  No, I don't definitively
[01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:40.590]  know, but I can't imagine
[01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:41.110]  it does.
[01:02:41.830 --> 01:02:43.150]  Eric, can you contact
[01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:45.130]  the Department of 56 people and tell them to make
[01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:47.150]  tiny town malls? I will do my best to
[01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:49.130]  do it. I feel like Andrew is the person that
[01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:51.150]  you want doing that. I feel like he has the best
[01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:52.930]  success at this thing, but
[01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:54.790]  I will do it for you if you'd like.
[01:02:55.210 --> 01:02:57.270]  Well, maybe Andrew would be better. That's what I'm saying.
[01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:59.150]  Eric, what's your percentage this
[01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:01.190]  week? Oh, I'm probably up to, like, a cool 70,
[01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:03.090]  75. I'm feeling pretty good.
[01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:05.170]  I'm feeling pretty good. It's like, here's the thing.
[01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:07.130]  This isn't, like...
[01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:09.450]  This isn't ankle integrity.
[01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:11.430]  Like, I think that's important to know
[01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:13.390]  is that this isn't a number
[01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:15.110]  that just goes up every week.
[01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:17.490]  It's a number where I look
[01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:19.670]  at what is on my calendar
[01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:21.510]  and how things work. And then, like, next
[01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:23.430]  week, probably not going to be
[01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:25.510]  just based on looking at what I have
[01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:27.410]  next week. Probably not going to be
[01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:29.110]  right around that number.
[01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:31.590]  Because I'm looking at my calendar
[01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:33.610]  and trying to decide which Thursday
[01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:35.430]  I want to kick off again about
[01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:37.270]  not having nitro.
[01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:39.470]  But it seems like maybe not next week.
[01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:41.190]  You can do it next week
[01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:43.370]  if you'd like. Yeah, that should
[01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:45.210]  be fine. Yeah, maybe just
[01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:46.930]  before we start, you just let me know how it's...
[01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:48.990]  Yeah, absolutely. I'll come in, we'll start the episode,
[01:03:49.210 --> 01:03:51.330]  I'll be, like, 44, and you're like, not this week.
[01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:52.990]  But then I go, like, 81,
[01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:54.830]  and you go, ooh, fucking get him.
[01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:57.030]  That's a good idea.
[01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:57.510]  That'll work.
[01:03:58.650 --> 01:04:00.710]  We should wrap up, though, because we are...
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.990]  I'm sorry, it's, you know, quick hour.
[01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:03.910]  Very quick hour.
[01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:05.770]  It was quick as dicks.
[01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:07.670]  It was pretty fucking quick.
[01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:09.650]  We should stop, though, because I have a reservation
[01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:11.350]  at Chumlee's at 410.
[01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:13.950]  Damn,
[01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:16.130]  he's fancy. His mall restaurant
[01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:16.850]  takes reservations.
[01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:19.970]  Goddamn. I was just gonna go with California Pizza
[01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:20.230]  Kitchen.
[01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:23.590]  I should say, on the way out,
[01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:25.870]  I'm gonna do a plug. We don't ever do
[01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:26.970]  these, but I figure I should.
[01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:29.870]  There's a comedy festival in
[01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:31.770]  Austin called the Moon Tower Just for Laughs
[01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:33.570]  Comedy Festival. It's a big deal
[01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:35.710]  in the comedy world, I guess,
[01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:37.810]  in Austin. They have it
[01:04:37.810 --> 01:04:39.790]  every year. Tons of
[01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:41.430]  comedians come for it. It's like a three-day...
[01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:43.730]  It's like... I don't know. It's like
[01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:44.690]  Woodstock for comedians.
[01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:47.750]  And Rooster Teeth is gonna put
[01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:49.470]  on a special Rooster Teeth podcast
[01:04:51.290 --> 01:04:51.810]  live,
[01:04:52.790 --> 01:04:53.590]  ticketed event
[01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:55.650]  on April 19th.
[01:04:55.650 --> 01:04:57.110]  Nick, when does this episode come out?
[01:04:59.130 --> 01:04:59.830]  This day?
[01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:01.490]  The 8th? No.
[01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:03.350]  The 19th. Okay, cool.
[01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:05.730]  So if you're listening to this
[01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:07.670]  and you're not doing anything, it's 6 o'clock
[01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:09.130]  tonight. If you wanna come out
[01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:11.810]  to the RT podcast,
[01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:13.830]  I'm in it because everybody
[01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:15.470]  else in the company said no.
[01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:16.730]  So I'll be there.
[01:05:17.290 --> 01:05:18.570]  And I'd love to see you.
[01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:21.830]  Somebody's
[01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:23.330]  listening and is just like, I gotta go!
[01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:25.610]  I don't have time! I gotta go!
[01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:27.910]  Also wanna say, you should come to RTX
[01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:29.630]  July 7th through 9th.
[01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:31.110]  We will have the F*** Face Museum.
[01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:33.910]  So that will be on the show floor.
[01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:35.910]  You can experience... well, I don't wanna
[01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:37.210]  give away the whole list, but
[01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:39.970]  we can say the porta potty will be there.
[01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:41.870]  And we can say... there's gonna be
[01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:44.050]  a few other things and something you have to see
[01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:44.950]  to believe.
[01:05:45.790 --> 01:05:47.770]  I got some stuff I need to give you
[01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:48.790]  probably for that. Yeah, absolutely.
[01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:50.650]  We're gonna need everybody's stuff.
[01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:53.710]  For instance, I'm looking at Gavin's
[01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:54.930]  Guilt Basket card.
[01:05:54.930 --> 01:05:56.370]  That could go up.
[01:05:56.850 --> 01:05:59.530]  I got Puss Puss and Owl Owl right here.
[01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:00.550]  I got the
[01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:02.990]  Thrice to Meet You. It's hanging on a
[01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:05.070]  hook. I can see it. That's perfect. That's a great one.
[01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:06.510]  I haven't even seen that.
[01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:08.050]  I got the rock from my backyard.
[01:06:09.370 --> 01:06:10.270]  F*** face rock.
[01:06:11.610 --> 01:06:12.950]  Oh, speaking of which, I know we're ending,
[01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:15.050]  but I saw something on social media
[01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:16.930]  the other day. I think it was on Reddit. Somebody had
[01:06:16.930 --> 01:06:18.930]  a suggestion. You know how pretty soon
[01:06:18.930 --> 01:06:20.910]  we're gonna dig our six foot hole
[01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:22.670]  and then we're gonna put a USB drive
[01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:24.790]  of the episode where we talked about digging the hole
[01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:26.990]  at the bottom of it? And just that?
[01:06:27.330 --> 01:06:28.850]  Somebody said you should
[01:06:28.850 --> 01:06:30.730]  put at the bottom and
[01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:32.810]  then place the USB drive on top
[01:06:32.810 --> 01:06:34.850]  of it. You should put a Protected by Falcons sign.
[01:06:35.070 --> 01:06:36.510]  And I think that's actually a great idea.
[01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.830]  Because then you dig
[01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:40.630]  all the way to the bottom and then you see it and you're like,
[01:06:40.690 --> 01:06:42.890]  oh s***, I found this USB drive. I wonder what's on it.
[01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:44.730]  Oh f***, it's also protected by Falcons.
[01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:45.870]  I don't know.
[01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:48.630]  Here's my only concern, Geoff. If they're
[01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:50.730]  a reasonable person, they would return the USB
[01:06:50.730 --> 01:06:52.730]  drive because it's protected by Falcons
[01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:54.330]  and they don't want that heat in their life.
[01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:57.070]  That's almost too much of a threat.
[01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:58.830]  I'm not, I don't want to steal
[01:06:58.830 --> 01:07:01.210]  something from a Falcon. It's protected by Falcons.
[01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:02.690]  Listen, maybe
[01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:04.650]  they're an Indiana Jones. Maybe they're not scared
[01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:06.770]  to f***ing throw caution to the wind and get chased
[01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:08.090]  by a giant bulldozer. I don't know.
[01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:10.690]  They put a different USB drive down and
[01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:11.210]  swap it.
[01:07:15.350 --> 01:07:16.790]  They carefully portion
[01:07:16.790 --> 01:07:18.890]  out a tiny bag of sand that's the exact same
[01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:21.150]  weight as the USB drive.
[01:07:23.030 --> 01:07:24.490]  Nick's got a good point. Do you think the
[01:07:24.490 --> 01:07:26.750]  strumming smell would be gone from the port
[01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:27.990]  probably by the time it's in the museum?
[01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:29.130]  I guess we'll find out.
[01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:32.810]  Didn't you order some of that?
[01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:34.570]  Yeah, so it's not going to be here
[01:07:34.570 --> 01:07:36.530]  anytime soon. You can't get it.
[01:07:36.690 --> 01:07:38.290]  I'm trying to get it in the US.
[01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:40.730]  Cannot get it in the US. It is coming from another
[01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:42.930]  country and so I'll keep everyone updated
[01:07:42.930 --> 01:07:44.610]  as it goes. It's also expensive.
[01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:46.670]  For gross fish.
[01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:48.630]  Oh, it was like 75 bucks
[01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:50.490]  for this tin of
[01:07:50.490 --> 01:07:51.510]  disgusting fish.
[01:07:51.930 --> 01:07:53.270]  Like, gross.
[01:07:55.210 --> 01:07:56.250]  I can't wait for this bit.
[01:07:56.370 --> 01:07:57.410]  Yeah, this is going to be...
[01:07:58.750 --> 01:08:00.350]  We need to wrap up, but Geoff
[01:08:00.350 --> 01:08:02.470]  I think will fall to his hubris and
[01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:04.670]  I think it's very exciting to see. Well, it's also going to be
[01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:06.710]  by the sounds of it in the summer by the time we do this.
[01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:07.950]  It's going to be the worst time ever.
[01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:10.610]  I have no memory of agreeing to do this
[01:08:10.610 --> 01:08:12.030]  bit. I guess I did recently.
[01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:14.090]  I will do it. I will do it.
[01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.350]  I'm not opposed to doing it.
[01:08:15.810 --> 01:08:17.490]  Did I? Is that where? I don't know.
[01:08:17.790 --> 01:08:20.370]  I can't remember it. You had confidence in your flaps.
[01:08:20.410 --> 01:08:21.230]  Your nose flaps. I do.
[01:08:22.090 --> 01:08:23.670]  I'm flexing my flaps right now.
[01:08:23.830 --> 01:08:24.190]  While we're talking.
[01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:26.890]  Alright, wrap up. Let's go.
[01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:30.170]  Alright. Hey, thanks for listening.
[01:08:30.850 --> 01:08:31.250]  And...
[01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:34.010]  Hey, come back next week and we'll do it all again.
[01:08:34.090 --> 01:08:35.150]  How's that sound? Huh?
[01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:37.070]  Alright. Ta-ta.
[01:08:38.690 --> 01:08:39.090]  Huh?
[01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:42.030]  I just realized that I
[01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:44.250]  shared my icing thing and you guys did not follow up
[01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:45.970]  with anything, I don't think. So I just like
[01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:47.630]  exposed my weirdness.
[01:08:47.830 --> 01:08:49.970]  I was on an island of weird. I'll have something
[01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:51.930]  next week. Great! Alright, bye. Bye.
[01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:53.990]  Hey, guys. Major League Fan
[01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:56.130]  Jack here with a look at next week's episode of
[01:08:56.130 --> 01:08:58.070]  F*** Face. This isn't a good
[01:08:58.070 --> 01:09:00.070]  first episode. Errol Flynn was a
[01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:01.950]  badass. Gavin has a secret
[01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:03.990]  apple. Geoff wants an NBA team
[01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:06.190]  in Austin. The boys talk brahmas.
[01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:08.090]  Should we buy Sloppy Joe's a new
[01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:10.090]  camera? And once again, Andrew
[01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:12.290]  does not eat the pencil. All that and more
[01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:14.130]  on next week's episode of F*** Face.
