[00:00.000 --> 00:01.220]  You ever wonder why we're here?
[00:06.220 --> 00:07.840]  It's one of life's great mysteries, isn't it?
[00:19.300 --> 00:20.600]  Whenever you're ready, 152.
[00:20.720 --> 00:21.520]  What happened in 150?
[00:21.840 --> 00:23.900]  You weren't here, I gave them a whole rundown.
[00:24.120 --> 00:27.680]  I gave them, I talked to them about the crazy, the Facebook messenger,
[00:28.300 --> 00:30.560]  like not hearing from people for like a decade, and
[00:30.560 --> 00:34.440]  going to Quarterm WrestleMania, and you wanted to be decided via a ladder match,
[00:34.840 --> 00:37.960]  and then Andrew had a weird ice pack, like it was the whole thing.
[00:38.260 --> 00:38.500]  Yeah.
[00:41.000 --> 00:43.820]  But that was 150, that was two episodes ago.
[00:44.220 --> 00:47.500]  So if you're hearing this, go back two episodes, you can hear that stuff.
[00:47.600 --> 00:50.040]  There was another episode that came out after what I just explained.
[00:50.300 --> 00:53.280]  And now we're on 152, and now Geoff, take it away.
[00:53.780 --> 00:56.840]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:57.180 --> 01:01.600]  You heard it from Eric already, this is episode 152.
[01:02.000 --> 01:04.040]  My, my, my, where does the time go?
[01:04.100 --> 01:06.300]  It feels like it was just episode 16 yesterday.
[01:06.300 --> 01:09.420]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, with me as always, Andrew Panton,
[01:09.500 --> 01:12.460]  and our British contingent, who are we speaking with today?
[01:12.760 --> 01:13.220]  I'm Gavin.
[01:13.440 --> 01:14.520]  Oh, just a Gavin today, okay.
[01:14.720 --> 01:15.760]  Yeah, not cheeky yet.
[01:16.140 --> 01:16.480]  Alright.
[01:17.120 --> 01:20.180]  Let us know if Errol decides to show up, or if...
[01:20.180 --> 01:23.220]  What was the other dude's name? Thomas the Bumbler, or whatever?
[01:23.720 --> 01:25.040]  Stuart the Bumbling Customer.
[01:25.400 --> 01:26.980]  Stuart the Bumbling Customer.
[01:27.660 --> 01:28.880]  Thomas the Bumbler!
[01:29.420 --> 01:31.080]  You know what, next week...
[01:31.080 --> 01:31.740]  That's a great character.
[01:32.780 --> 01:34.200]  Thomas the Bumbler is so much better.
[01:34.200 --> 01:35.920]  For next week, I should...
[01:35.920 --> 01:40.080]  Maybe I'll cut a compilation of all the videos of me as Stuart the Bumbling Customer,
[01:40.260 --> 01:41.320]  from throughout the years.
[01:41.380 --> 01:42.420]  Oh my god, yes.
[01:42.740 --> 01:44.180]  You filmed videos of this?
[01:44.280 --> 01:44.800]  Oh my god.
[01:44.800 --> 01:46.260]  Dude, I filmed everything.
[01:48.020 --> 01:48.780]  I'm so excited.
[01:49.220 --> 01:52.680]  Can you show it to Meg the way that you made her listen to the best of,
[01:52.760 --> 01:54.960]  so that way it's just another thing she has to suffer through?
[01:55.420 --> 01:56.280]  She'll leave me.
[01:59.680 --> 02:01.400]  Gavin, I have got to say, man,
[02:01.400 --> 02:04.760]  I've known you now for, I don't know, 20 years or something?
[02:05.240 --> 02:05.840]  19 years?
[02:06.500 --> 02:08.120]  You are the GIF that keeps on giving.
[02:08.660 --> 02:11.800]  I didn't know Errol or Thomas the Bumbler existed last week,
[02:11.860 --> 02:14.920]  and now to find out that his entire history has been recorded?
[02:15.600 --> 02:16.680]  God damn, dude.
[02:16.820 --> 02:18.940]  I bet. I'm sure of it.
[02:18.980 --> 02:21.200]  I must have been wearing Rooster Teeth merch as Stuart.
[02:21.480 --> 02:22.200]  That's great.
[02:23.600 --> 02:25.340]  So Stuart's a RT fan, that's cool.
[02:25.540 --> 02:26.760]  I like him more already.
[02:27.280 --> 02:28.140]  That's fantastic.
[02:29.060 --> 02:30.760]  I'm thinking about the weird thing.
[02:30.760 --> 02:32.520]  Gavin and I in the same space.
[02:32.660 --> 02:34.280]  What a combination of weird.
[02:34.680 --> 02:38.000]  Like if somebody walked into a room that I was sleeping in
[02:38.000 --> 02:40.340]  with a fucking bag of icing on my head
[02:40.340 --> 02:43.160]  while there's somebody gagging in the bathroom brushing their teeth.
[02:43.220 --> 02:44.480]  That's such a great one, too.
[02:44.840 --> 02:45.940]  That's just complete weirdness.
[02:46.040 --> 02:47.260]  Yeah, what were everyone else's?
[02:48.140 --> 02:49.940]  Eric said Gavin's supposed to be the boring one.
[02:50.280 --> 02:51.980]  Not boring, just not interesting.
[02:53.260 --> 02:55.380]  Well, you did argue boring at one point, but that's fine.
[02:55.600 --> 02:55.980]  We can move on.
[02:56.180 --> 02:58.880]  You have alter egos, and you filmed videos of them.
[02:59.380 --> 02:59.580]  Yeah.
[02:59.580 --> 03:00.120]  No, you're right.
[03:00.320 --> 03:02.900]  Was it a boring off, or like a not?
[03:03.180 --> 03:05.540]  It was a boring off. It was a definite boring off.
[03:05.840 --> 03:06.980]  Eric hated the bit.
[03:07.260 --> 03:08.760]  Well, it's bad for content.
[03:09.500 --> 03:10.460]  But it's not in content.
[03:10.500 --> 03:12.980]  Yeah, let's use most boring in the entertaining show.
[03:13.240 --> 03:14.920]  I'm boring outside of content.
[03:16.060 --> 03:17.480]  When I'm not Errol or Stuart.
[03:19.940 --> 03:23.100]  When you were a kid, when you were a young lad,
[03:23.620 --> 03:27.540]  and if you wanted to work up the courage to talk to a girl you were interested in,
[03:27.540 --> 03:30.700]  would you slip into Errol because he was a little bit cheekier and more confident,
[03:30.920 --> 03:32.140]  or would you just go with Gavin?
[03:32.540 --> 03:33.680]  I wouldn't go anywhere.
[03:34.840 --> 03:36.980]  Neither of them would go and talk to the girl.
[03:37.480 --> 03:40.560]  So Errol wasn't into talking to girls either.
[03:40.980 --> 03:41.200]  No.
[03:44.580 --> 03:48.140]  They were both massive babies.
[03:51.620 --> 03:54.520]  So what was everyone else's weird but normal thing?
[03:54.840 --> 03:55.640]  I don't think they said.
[03:55.640 --> 03:57.400]  I think it's just you and I currently.
[03:57.760 --> 03:59.660]  Eric says nothing.
[03:59.660 --> 04:00.420]  Eric says nothing.
[04:00.880 --> 04:01.760]  Entering the boring off.
[04:01.940 --> 04:03.560]  Eric said, we're just normal.
[04:03.940 --> 04:05.300]  I don't think Eric's normal.
[04:05.660 --> 04:07.380]  No, we're just innocent men.
[04:07.680 --> 04:09.040]  We don't have anything that's weird.
[04:09.320 --> 04:10.120]  Just normal men.
[04:10.240 --> 04:12.920]  You post pictures of those dogs all the time.
[04:13.140 --> 04:13.580]  Yeah.
[04:13.940 --> 04:15.180]  Those things, you have boarzois.
[04:15.560 --> 04:16.280]  The boarzois.
[04:17.440 --> 04:18.260]  It's great.
[04:18.480 --> 04:19.700]  But you actually like it.
[04:19.840 --> 04:21.300]  You don't think that's a cool looking dog?
[04:22.540 --> 04:25.840]  Yeah, it's cool to look at once and be like, that's a pretty interesting looking dog.
[04:25.960 --> 04:27.300]  But you genuinely...
[04:28.240 --> 04:30.020]  Look at that thing.
[04:30.500 --> 04:31.400]  What the fuck?
[04:31.540 --> 04:32.460]  That's crazy.
[04:32.920 --> 04:36.000]  It's like a dog with motion blur when it sits still.
[04:37.580 --> 04:42.040]  It's like a physical Animorphs cover, but it's just one thing.
[04:43.120 --> 04:47.100]  It looks like you tried to take a panorama picture of a regular dog.
[04:48.460 --> 04:53.040]  That dog's eyes are looking up as if to say, Eric, please stop making fun of me.
[04:56.940 --> 04:59.820]  I think Geoff's was maybe Wolverine.
[04:59.940 --> 05:00.620]  I think that counts.
[05:00.720 --> 05:03.340]  That wasn't specific related to that, but I think that qualifies.
[05:03.480 --> 05:05.780]  I think he was vulnerable in that moment.
[05:06.740 --> 05:08.140]  I had an issue with the ice.
[05:08.200 --> 05:08.920]  It's too effective.
[05:09.120 --> 05:10.000]  I used it recently.
[05:10.880 --> 05:12.280]  Did you have a headache again?
[05:12.740 --> 05:14.280]  No, I just wasn't comfortable.
[05:14.280 --> 05:16.060]  I was feeling like, I'm a little hot.
[05:16.060 --> 05:17.700]  I need to go to sleep.
[05:17.820 --> 05:19.580]  I'm going to throw this icing on my head.
[05:20.220 --> 05:21.520]  And it was so cool.
[05:21.880 --> 05:24.300]  I was like, this is one of the best ideas I've ever had.
[05:24.460 --> 05:25.440]  This is fantastic.
[05:25.920 --> 05:29.260]  And to reiterate, is it cool from just being out in the room?
[05:29.300 --> 05:30.580]  It's not like a refrigerated ice?
[05:30.580 --> 05:31.140]  No, no, no.
[05:31.200 --> 05:32.100]  It's just out in the room.
[05:32.180 --> 05:34.060]  It's always on my bedside table in the room.
[05:34.140 --> 05:36.800]  I like to keep my room really cold, so it gets really cold.
[05:36.880 --> 05:39.840]  I'll put on my head and it just feels so refreshing and just nice.
[05:40.480 --> 05:42.540]  I wonder if I put the icing on my head, I would gag.
[05:44.280 --> 05:46.240]  I mean, we should try that at some point.
[05:50.720 --> 05:52.400]  I posted a photo on our Slack.
[05:52.540 --> 05:53.280]  That was a beard hair.
[05:53.400 --> 05:55.800]  I had like a tooth issue and I was trying to like just numb.
[05:57.360 --> 05:58.840]  Anyway, I put on my head.
[05:59.200 --> 05:59.580]  Wait, what?
[05:59.980 --> 06:00.420]  Hang on.
[06:00.620 --> 06:01.120]  Hang on.
[06:01.620 --> 06:02.540]  My mouth was sore.
[06:03.000 --> 06:04.360]  So it's like, you know, I don't have ice.
[06:04.440 --> 06:06.680]  I'll just use the icing.
[06:06.920 --> 06:08.420]  I'll just lower it a little bit.
[06:08.480 --> 06:10.360]  Instead of being on my forehead, I'll put on my jaw.
[06:10.780 --> 06:11.140]  What?
[06:11.140 --> 06:12.440]  How's the tooth doing?
[06:12.880 --> 06:13.360]  It's fine.
[06:13.580 --> 06:14.020]  We're okay.
[06:15.580 --> 06:17.880]  But the issue with the icing is it's too good.
[06:18.100 --> 06:20.360]  It's too effective at being cooling and relaxing.
[06:20.700 --> 06:24.160]  Because I put it on and I was like, I'm just going to put this on for a little bit.
[06:24.220 --> 06:24.820]  Get cozy.
[06:25.000 --> 06:25.800]  Then I'll take it off.
[06:25.880 --> 06:27.440]  Then I'll be able to instantly fall asleep.
[06:27.880 --> 06:29.080]  And I put it on.
[06:29.180 --> 06:30.120]  I was like, this is great.
[06:30.220 --> 06:32.180]  And then I woke up and it was morning.
[06:32.360 --> 06:34.000]  And like eight hours had passed.
[06:34.600 --> 06:38.300]  And I was very groggy and being like, oh, fuck.
[06:38.340 --> 06:40.400]  I don't think I don't remember what happened.
[06:40.400 --> 06:41.720]  I put the icing on.
[06:41.920 --> 06:43.460]  And then that's all I remember.
[06:43.640 --> 06:44.580]  I don't think I took it.
[06:44.760 --> 06:45.600]  I put it away.
[06:45.960 --> 06:47.940]  And I felt my end table and there's nothing there.
[06:48.020 --> 06:48.880]  I was like, oh, no.
[06:49.140 --> 06:54.200]  So I had to spend the first like minute and a half of waking up looking for my bag of icing in the bed.
[06:55.680 --> 06:57.360]  Terrified that somehow it had opened.
[06:57.560 --> 06:59.020]  But I'm like going through the sheets.
[06:59.220 --> 07:01.080]  I'm just like, this is such a stupid problem.
[07:01.340 --> 07:02.620]  I got to find my icing.
[07:03.800 --> 07:06.800]  Do you think if you had rolled over on it, it would have...
[07:06.800 --> 07:08.000]  It seems pretty durable.
[07:08.220 --> 07:09.340]  It seems like a pretty big bag.
[07:09.340 --> 07:11.240]  I was so confused.
[07:11.560 --> 07:15.180]  It immediately knocked me out as soon as I put on my head.
[07:15.600 --> 07:18.100]  You know how some people have water beds?
[07:18.780 --> 07:19.040]  Yeah.
[07:19.880 --> 07:20.940]  I've never been on one.
[07:20.940 --> 07:21.340]  Not anymore.
[07:22.140 --> 07:25.260]  Well, there's probably some people out there with them.
[07:26.220 --> 07:26.520]  I guess.
[07:26.540 --> 07:30.960]  But maybe the icing bed, the icing mattress would be the future.
[07:31.740 --> 07:32.900]  That would be really...
[07:32.900 --> 07:35.420]  Because it would solidify.
[07:35.540 --> 07:36.320]  You'd get some heat.
[07:36.540 --> 07:38.580]  I think the problem would be you'd probably sink into it.
[07:38.580 --> 07:40.460]  Because your body would heat up the icing.
[07:40.940 --> 07:42.040]  And it would become looser.
[07:42.300 --> 07:45.060]  And you'd slowly melt down in the night.
[07:45.240 --> 07:47.240]  You'd slowly melt into the bed.
[07:47.640 --> 07:50.060]  You'd become like a knife through butter as you sleep.
[07:50.520 --> 07:50.920]  Exactly.
[07:51.340 --> 07:54.160]  The first thing I thought of was that he was sleeping on a big cake.
[07:54.460 --> 07:55.840]  And then the whole thing is icing.
[07:56.000 --> 07:56.860]  So I guess it's not.
[07:57.260 --> 07:59.000]  But I think what you're describing...
[07:59.000 --> 08:01.660]  Eventually, we are a short walk to sleeping on cake.
[08:02.160 --> 08:04.100]  That is where I think we're going with this right now.
[08:04.100 --> 08:08.080]  Can we fill an inflatable mattress with icing for Andrew?
[08:10.900 --> 08:11.820]  We can?
[08:12.760 --> 08:13.220]  Yes.
[08:13.660 --> 08:14.200]  How would you...
[08:14.200 --> 08:15.980]  You'd need to like...
[08:15.980 --> 08:16.800]  Syringe?
[08:17.000 --> 08:17.700]  What would you do?
[08:17.780 --> 08:18.420]  How would you fill it?
[08:18.480 --> 08:19.680]  Just get like a pump.
[08:20.040 --> 08:20.240]  Yeah.
[08:20.460 --> 08:21.700]  That would be it.
[08:23.080 --> 08:25.920]  Or just get the icing thing that they do to put on cakes.
[08:27.080 --> 08:28.320]  Just a massive one?
[08:28.700 --> 08:29.100]  Yeah.
[08:29.400 --> 08:30.780]  You'd have to refill it all the time.
[08:33.500 --> 08:35.260]  I think you would sleep so well.
[08:35.320 --> 08:36.920]  I don't know if I would.
[08:37.100 --> 08:39.000]  I don't think you would at all.
[08:39.200 --> 08:42.140]  I think I have the optimal icing experience as is.
[08:42.200 --> 08:45.900]  I'd worry about sinking through the bed with the full icing.
[08:46.340 --> 08:48.100]  You wouldn't melt through the plastic.
[08:48.500 --> 08:49.940]  I sleep pretty hot.
[08:50.540 --> 08:53.520]  And you know, as a blanket guy, I got a lot of blankets on there.
[08:53.580 --> 08:55.260]  I feel like it generates and maintains heat.
[08:55.360 --> 08:56.900]  I think I would go through it.
[08:57.220 --> 08:59.280]  Yeah, but from our previous conversations,
[08:59.280 --> 09:03.020]  it sounds like only from the knees down do you actually interact with the mattress.
[09:03.200 --> 09:04.640]  The rest of you is up eight pillows.
[09:05.220 --> 09:07.660]  No, so it's sort of like what I'm saying.
[09:07.880 --> 09:09.480]  There's a decline for sure.
[09:09.660 --> 09:13.480]  I start at the top of Pillow Mountain and I slowly go...
[09:13.480 --> 09:15.560]  I float down into it.
[09:15.640 --> 09:17.000]  Or I plummet into the bed.
[09:17.460 --> 09:22.020]  Maybe mattresses out then and we just give you a nice big icing pillow.
[09:23.020 --> 09:23.420]  Oh!
[09:24.840 --> 09:25.880]  That would be good.
[09:26.260 --> 09:27.960]  But once again, I feel like I have the optimal experience.
[09:27.960 --> 09:30.640]  Because it gets hot, I have to take it off after like 10 or 15 minutes.
[09:30.980 --> 09:31.980]  So you gotta rotate.
[09:32.440 --> 09:34.120]  The icing is too hot?
[09:34.600 --> 09:36.400]  Well, it becomes like room temperature.
[09:36.600 --> 09:37.700]  Like it's no longer cool.
[09:38.040 --> 09:39.120]  I no longer feel the effect.
[09:39.220 --> 09:41.480]  So I'll put it on like maybe 10 minutes one side.
[09:41.540 --> 09:42.560]  And then I'll flip it over.
[09:42.860 --> 09:45.300]  And then you switch to one of the other seven pillows.
[09:47.620 --> 09:48.660]  Yeah, I guess.
[09:48.720 --> 09:50.800]  But then it just seems like that's too much icing.
[09:50.900 --> 09:52.440]  A giant pillow's worth of icing.
[09:52.980 --> 09:54.120]  That seems like a lot.
[09:54.540 --> 09:57.780]  Or this is a nice little bag I could just put on my bedside table.
[09:58.540 --> 10:00.340]  It's not inconvenient in any way.
[10:00.660 --> 10:02.100]  That was just a whole...
[10:02.100 --> 10:03.640]  Having to try to find the icing.
[10:04.080 --> 10:04.960]  Falling asleep with it.
[10:05.060 --> 10:05.920]  It was a dangerous game.
[10:06.020 --> 10:08.700]  Do I sound okay?
[10:09.120 --> 10:11.700]  I had a whole issue with my setup recently.
[10:12.260 --> 10:13.200]  What happened?
[10:13.540 --> 10:14.420]  You sound fine.
[10:14.940 --> 10:16.700]  I was worried I broke everything.
[10:17.220 --> 10:18.500]  And I was scared to tell Nick.
[10:19.460 --> 10:20.780]  I climbed into bed.
[10:21.160 --> 10:24.700]  And a blanket ended up underneath one of the legs of my chairs.
[10:25.360 --> 10:27.220]  And I filled up my Gerpler all the way.
[10:27.220 --> 10:28.340]  And I was like, I'm going to wake up.
[10:28.380 --> 10:29.380]  I'm going to drink some water.
[10:29.840 --> 10:30.720]  Begin my day.
[10:30.900 --> 10:32.620]  And the blanket cover was stuck.
[10:32.700 --> 10:34.200]  Or the blanket was stuck under the wheel.
[10:34.280 --> 10:35.100]  I pulled the wheel.
[10:35.180 --> 10:36.280]  The chair fell backwards.
[10:36.440 --> 10:37.860]  It knocked over my Gerpler.
[10:38.260 --> 10:40.360]  You never want to spill a full Gerpler.
[10:40.480 --> 10:41.360]  There's so much water.
[10:41.820 --> 10:43.980]  It was like a wave hit my desk.
[10:44.120 --> 10:46.740]  And it all fell over whatever my equipment is.
[10:46.880 --> 10:47.940]  What is this thing called?
[10:48.620 --> 10:49.560]  The Scarlet?
[10:49.560 --> 10:50.920]  No, the Scarlet.
[10:51.040 --> 10:53.240]  Went all over the Scarlet.
[10:53.680 --> 10:54.840]  So I was terrified I broke that.
[10:54.880 --> 10:56.500]  I assume that's an expensive piece of tech.
[10:56.700 --> 10:57.620]  I have no idea.
[10:58.460 --> 10:59.640]  But we're good? We sound good?
[11:00.160 --> 11:01.240]  You sound great.
[11:05.300 --> 11:06.840]  What flavor is the icing?
[11:07.200 --> 11:09.080]  Just plain vanilla, I assume.
[11:09.880 --> 11:10.640]  I could probably...
[11:10.640 --> 11:13.300]  I don't know if I still have the box for it.
[11:13.320 --> 11:14.680]  But it came from a gingerbread house.
[11:14.740 --> 11:17.460]  So theoretically, people could get an identical bag.
[11:18.300 --> 11:19.680]  You could experience this.
[11:20.820 --> 11:23.520]  Is that important to people?
[11:24.040 --> 11:24.880]  No, I'm just saying.
[11:25.000 --> 11:26.460]  If they want to test it out.
[11:26.540 --> 11:30.320]  They could get the exact same bag of icing that I use.
[11:30.400 --> 11:31.660]  Well, obviously not the exact same.
[11:32.360 --> 11:34.700]  Would you consider mailing it to Austin?
[11:34.980 --> 11:36.860]  To take a place in the F*** Face Museum?
[11:39.100 --> 11:41.100]  I could, but that's a big ask.
[11:41.200 --> 11:43.640]  Because it's a really big part of my rotation.
[11:43.720 --> 11:45.220]  I was just about to say.
[11:45.220 --> 11:46.780]  When he didn't immediately go,
[11:46.940 --> 11:47.900]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[11:48.040 --> 11:49.600]  I went, I don't know if this one's happening.
[11:49.920 --> 11:51.800]  It is a great idea.
[11:51.980 --> 11:53.820]  Even though he just told everyone how to get one.
[11:55.720 --> 11:57.420]  He already has one.
[11:57.900 --> 12:00.020]  But I'd have to buy a new gingerbread house.
[12:00.360 --> 12:04.220]  Okay, what if you just give us a picture of the box.
[12:04.380 --> 12:08.360]  And then we can go buy our own gingerbread house.
[12:08.460 --> 12:13.220]  And then we can put a facsimile of the icing in the museum.
[12:13.220 --> 12:14.840]  Like this is what it looks like.
[12:15.080 --> 12:15.980]  I'm okay with that.
[12:16.060 --> 12:18.120]  I'm even potentially okay with mailing it away.
[12:18.200 --> 12:19.800]  I just need to make sure I can find the box.
[12:19.900 --> 12:20.800]  And I know which one it is.
[12:20.860 --> 12:23.240]  It's kind of like when you go to a museum.
[12:23.880 --> 12:25.780]  Not all of the paintings are the real paintings.
[12:25.960 --> 12:26.800]  Some of the more...
[12:27.940 --> 12:31.120]  Some of the pricier, rarer paintings are just really good dupes.
[12:31.200 --> 12:32.160]  That assholes get to look at.
[12:32.200 --> 12:34.540]  But the real paintings, you know, in cold storage somewhere.
[12:34.720 --> 12:35.480]  Being kept safe.
[12:36.520 --> 12:38.020]  Would you guys be open to trying this?
[12:38.520 --> 12:39.740]  Like we did the waffle thing.
[12:39.740 --> 12:40.840]  What do you mean by trying?
[12:42.700 --> 12:44.580]  I don't know how to duplicate necessarily.
[12:45.060 --> 12:45.520]  You know what?
[12:45.520 --> 12:46.720]  I'm going to come back to this.
[12:46.800 --> 12:48.740]  I'm going to try putting it in my fridge.
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.400]  And see how that compares to the standard experience I have.
[12:53.680 --> 12:55.960]  And the same way that I bought everybody tiny waffle makers.
[12:56.080 --> 12:57.080]  We all made desk waffles.
[12:57.760 --> 13:00.960]  And I feel like the reception generally was pretty good to that idea.
[13:01.440 --> 13:01.580]  Yeah.
[13:02.240 --> 13:04.420]  I think a better experience than you would have anticipated.
[13:04.600 --> 13:05.320]  So maybe...
[13:05.320 --> 13:06.780]  I know this seems insane.
[13:06.780 --> 13:09.660]  But maybe this isn't the same boat of, you know what?
[13:09.940 --> 13:10.620]  It's ridiculous.
[13:10.920 --> 13:12.020]  But it's a pretty good idea.
[13:12.460 --> 13:13.140]  Works pretty well.
[13:13.380 --> 13:14.060]  Life hack.
[13:14.820 --> 13:19.580]  Can we announce that we have made...
[13:19.580 --> 13:22.460]  And we saw the first iteration of the waffle maker?
[13:22.800 --> 13:23.080]  Oh!
[13:23.560 --> 13:24.180]  I'd love to.
[13:25.680 --> 13:27.760]  There's some that are going to be at RTX, right?
[13:28.020 --> 13:28.760]  I believe so.
[13:28.780 --> 13:30.280]  I think you'll be able to buy them at RTX.
[13:30.620 --> 13:32.960]  And then we'll also have them available online.
[13:32.960 --> 13:36.320]  We made a mini waffle maker
[13:36.320 --> 13:37.080]  that says...
[13:38.080 --> 13:40.140]  It says ****face on it.
[13:40.260 --> 13:42.860]  It has the logo stamped in the middle of the waffle.
[13:43.380 --> 13:44.060]  It's real.
[13:44.280 --> 13:47.080]  Did we find a way to sell it for less than 80 bucks?
[13:47.320 --> 13:48.700]  Yes, I believe we did.
[13:48.760 --> 13:49.100]  Oh, nice.
[13:49.400 --> 13:50.960]  It looks so good.
[13:51.140 --> 13:52.680]  Oh, that's so amazing.
[13:53.720 --> 13:55.360]  Look at this.
[13:55.780 --> 13:56.400]  It's beautiful.
[13:56.720 --> 13:57.980]  That's crazy.
[13:58.500 --> 13:59.820]  Imagine the syrup
[13:59.820 --> 14:01.840]  flowing around the logo.
[14:01.840 --> 14:03.940]  I was thinking the same thing.
[14:04.360 --> 14:05.980]  Can you imagine the little stars
[14:05.980 --> 14:07.340]  are full of butter and syrup?
[14:07.500 --> 14:08.560]  That'd be the best part.
[14:09.760 --> 14:11.860]  What letter do you think is going to taste the best?
[14:12.340 --> 14:12.980]  The C.
[14:13.900 --> 14:14.760]  The C?
[14:15.120 --> 14:16.220]  You think the C?
[14:16.680 --> 14:17.960]  I think the ratios are good.
[14:18.540 --> 14:19.860]  The A has a lot of space.
[14:20.020 --> 14:21.540]  I see what you mean with the ratios.
[14:21.740 --> 14:24.260]  I think the K looks especially delicious as well.
[14:24.260 --> 14:26.240]  I was leaning towards K as well.
[14:26.840 --> 14:28.520]  I think if you can
[14:28.520 --> 14:30.240]  eat both stars together,
[14:30.380 --> 14:31.860]  that will be the best part, but
[14:31.860 --> 14:34.520]  if it is only a single star, it will not hold up.
[14:36.060 --> 14:36.540]  Interesting.
[14:36.840 --> 14:38.540]  So, both stars
[14:38.540 --> 14:39.700]  should be consumed together.
[14:40.340 --> 14:42.160]  That's how I feel personally,
[14:42.380 --> 14:44.700]  but you guys eat your waffles the way that you want.
[14:44.960 --> 14:46.160]  When I get my one of these,
[14:46.280 --> 14:47.960]  I'm just going to cut off everything
[14:47.960 --> 14:50.460]  except the logo and then cut each thing into individual
[14:50.460 --> 14:52.600]  letters and just do taste tests, I think.
[14:52.600 --> 14:54.020]  I think this is the way to go.
[14:54.400 --> 14:55.220]  I think, yeah.
[14:55.880 --> 14:58.000]  Do you have a certain way you eat your waffles or pancakes?
[14:58.360 --> 14:59.140]  My mouth.
[14:59.860 --> 15:01.100]  Your mouth? That's a good technique.
[15:02.060 --> 15:04.640]  I'm glad that it's being used for other things than Dan's dick.
[15:04.860 --> 15:06.500]  That's a great...
[15:07.380 --> 15:08.180]  second location.
[15:10.060 --> 15:11.340]  Sorry, that was Terry
[15:11.340 --> 15:12.100]  or whatever.
[15:13.200 --> 15:14.800]  That was a little bit sassy.
[15:14.920 --> 15:15.800]  Where did that bit come from?
[15:18.440 --> 15:19.240]  150 episodes
[15:19.240 --> 15:20.780]  and now we're just getting them.
[15:20.780 --> 15:23.200]  Just going after them.
[15:23.820 --> 15:25.100]  What's going on?
[15:26.360 --> 15:28.020]  I had a real...
[15:28.020 --> 15:29.620]  That was Terry or whatever. I don't remember.
[15:29.780 --> 15:31.920]  That was Errol 2.0.
[15:32.540 --> 15:33.920]  Errol, you need your own words.
[15:34.500 --> 15:36.560]  I'm Carol. I'm completely different.
[15:36.840 --> 15:38.620]  That was a very Roman
[15:38.620 --> 15:40.160]  Raymond Saumur type comment.
[15:41.260 --> 15:41.820]  Roman.
[15:42.800 --> 15:43.360]  Roman.
[15:43.900 --> 15:46.500]  For the record, Gavin, I left that joke in 151.
[15:46.680 --> 15:48.080]  Andrew brought it to 151.
[15:48.660 --> 15:49.340]  That'll be it.
[15:49.380 --> 15:50.960]  I'll never use it again. I just had to.
[15:51.040 --> 15:52.900]  I was so disappointed with your response.
[15:53.440 --> 15:54.180]  I probably will.
[15:54.460 --> 15:55.880]  I didn't know what to do with it.
[15:57.980 --> 15:58.920]  Hey, you know what though?
[15:59.280 --> 16:00.340]  Put it in your mouth, alright?
[16:02.120 --> 16:04.000]  Oh yeah, so what is the answer
[16:04.000 --> 16:04.600]  to that question?
[16:05.380 --> 16:07.080]  The cutting? The structure?
[16:08.320 --> 16:09.560]  I like to cut
[16:09.980 --> 16:11.960]  corner by corner. I like to leave the space
[16:11.960 --> 16:12.840]  in the middle last.
[16:13.280 --> 16:15.060]  I always do that whenever I'm eating anything.
[16:15.060 --> 16:16.920]  Like pancakes, specifically.
[16:17.340 --> 16:19.060]  And it became weird. Remember when I had the
[16:19.060 --> 16:20.380]  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle
[16:20.900 --> 16:23.260]  waffle maker? That was one of my rotational ones.
[16:23.520 --> 16:25.060]  It would just be the turtle nose.
[16:25.180 --> 16:26.940]  So I'd just end up with a little turtle nose
[16:26.940 --> 16:29.060]  of a pancake. Which wasn't
[16:29.060 --> 16:30.980]  the most appetizing, but I just have a
[16:31.480 --> 16:32.200]  certain structure.
[16:32.540 --> 16:34.760]  I don't think I have an approach to eating a waffle.
[16:34.860 --> 16:35.600]  I think I just eat it.
[16:35.700 --> 16:39.280]  I think the middle part always tastes the best,
[16:39.340 --> 16:40.520]  so I save that for last.
[16:40.580 --> 16:43.200]  So I go top, left, right, and then I naturally
[16:43.200 --> 16:44.440]  kind of leave the middle area.
[16:44.680 --> 16:47.200]  Is that how you do a McDonald's cheeseburger? I feel like the middle of that
[16:47.200 --> 16:49.260]  is always pretty good. Really? You think the middle of the
[16:49.260 --> 16:51.020]  cheeseburger is the best part? Interesting.
[16:51.180 --> 16:53.200]  No! I've never tried just eating the
[16:53.200 --> 16:54.520]  edges of the burger.
[16:55.040 --> 16:57.360]  Just taking a bite and then rotating a little bit?
[16:57.660 --> 16:58.260]  That's interesting.
[16:58.920 --> 17:01.500]  I did try... I thought in my head
[17:01.500 --> 17:03.340]  the greatest fast food burger
[17:03.340 --> 17:05.480]  would be a quarter pounder patty
[17:05.480 --> 17:06.620]  with a Whopper bun.
[17:06.940 --> 17:08.780]  That was a thought I had recently, so I did that.
[17:08.880 --> 17:10.320]  Would not recommend. Wasn't good.
[17:10.320 --> 17:12.080]  Oh, what wasn't good about it?
[17:12.200 --> 17:14.360]  What was weird is the patty had
[17:14.360 --> 17:16.340]  more to do with the taste of the
[17:16.340 --> 17:17.640]  bun than I anticipated.
[17:17.980 --> 17:19.400]  Wait, you did this?
[17:19.820 --> 17:21.900]  I did this, yeah. I did this weeks ago.
[17:22.320 --> 17:23.420]  What? It was like three weeks ago.
[17:23.540 --> 17:26.560]  I had the thought, I was like, what would be the best fast food
[17:26.560 --> 17:28.180]  burger? And I like the
[17:28.180 --> 17:30.040]  chewiness of the Burger King bun,
[17:30.200 --> 17:32.140]  but I really like the patty
[17:32.140 --> 17:34.280]  and everything of the quarter pounder. I think it's
[17:34.280 --> 17:36.160]  good. I like that he does this
[17:36.160 --> 17:38.020]  and it doesn't even register as a face bit.
[17:38.020 --> 17:39.840]  Like, you did this
[17:39.840 --> 17:41.800]  weeks ago and you never
[17:41.800 --> 17:43.940]  talked about how you bought two
[17:43.940 --> 17:45.560]  burgers from separate places,
[17:45.700 --> 17:47.480]  made them one super burger,
[17:47.840 --> 17:49.540]  and never brought it up again.
[17:49.540 --> 17:52.140]  We had a whole bit about mixing different condiments
[17:52.140 --> 17:54.080]  together and it almost ended the show.
[17:54.160 --> 17:56.400]  Now you're mixing different fast foods together?
[17:56.540 --> 17:57.780]  Maybe that's why.
[17:57.960 --> 17:59.320]  Maybe that's why I didn't bring it up.
[17:59.520 --> 18:02.120]  What? Because there's a Burger King
[18:02.120 --> 18:04.140]  and a McDonald's next to each other
[18:04.140 --> 18:05.920]  for where I live, and I thought, huh,
[18:05.920 --> 18:08.020]  they'd still be fresh, and I
[18:08.020 --> 18:10.420]  could put the Whopper on the quarter pounder
[18:11.700 --> 18:12.100]  bun
[18:12.100 --> 18:13.880]  and all that, and put the
[18:14.340 --> 18:15.460]  quarter pounder on the Whopper.
[18:15.940 --> 18:17.720]  So I tried both, and it was very weird because
[18:17.720 --> 18:20.100]  the bun tasted kind of like it translated
[18:20.100 --> 18:21.940]  with the patty. Like, when I was
[18:21.940 --> 18:23.860]  eating the quarter pounder, it
[18:23.860 --> 18:25.940]  tasted more like a quarter pounder than it did a
[18:25.940 --> 18:27.740]  Whopper. And then when I ate the Whopper, the
[18:27.740 --> 18:30.020]  chewiness of the bun. It was very weird. You're out there just like
[18:30.020 --> 18:31.820]  freaky Friday at your lunch?
[18:32.100 --> 18:33.180]  I was, yeah!
[18:33.180 --> 18:35.020]  Well, I was considering
[18:35.020 --> 18:37.140]  like, what would be a great addition is Wendy's has
[18:37.140 --> 18:39.220]  the best bacon, but the Wendy's isn't close
[18:39.220 --> 18:41.360]  to the Burger King or the McDonald's, so I couldn't
[18:41.360 --> 18:42.980]  just get a Baconator to then
[18:42.980 --> 18:45.160]  pluck the bacon. And then you need to have
[18:45.160 --> 18:47.060]  equal sandwiches, because you don't want to waste any
[18:47.060 --> 18:49.080]  food, so. It was a whole thing.
[18:49.460 --> 18:51.180]  But I've been in the lab. I've been figuring
[18:51.180 --> 18:53.280]  out. I didn't report on it because it wasn't great.
[18:54.280 --> 18:55.340]  Yeah, Geoff, get a load
[18:55.340 --> 18:56.680]  of this fucking scientist.
[19:00.980 --> 19:01.700]  I thought...
[19:02.720 --> 19:03.160]  I thought...
[19:03.160 --> 19:04.800]  You have to make a face lab coat
[19:04.800 --> 19:05.640]  for Andrew.
[19:07.080 --> 19:08.760]  I've been in the lab. I've been trying things.
[19:08.780 --> 19:10.380]  What else are you doing in the lab?
[19:10.900 --> 19:12.840]  Well, it became really... I was
[19:12.840 --> 19:15.100]  genuinely disappointed by how not
[19:15.100 --> 19:17.040]  great either burger was with that
[19:17.040 --> 19:19.200]  flip, so it gave me... I lost some
[19:19.200 --> 19:21.100]  burger confidence in quite a literal way.
[19:21.400 --> 19:23.100]  And I've been back to the drawing
[19:23.100 --> 19:25.060]  board of a thing. I had
[19:25.060 --> 19:27.300]  an A&W burger recently. It had surprisingly
[19:27.300 --> 19:29.080]  good bacon. It might have sneaky good
[19:29.080 --> 19:31.140]  fast food bacon, so there's
[19:31.140 --> 19:33.180]  a Wendy's next to an A&W where I
[19:33.180 --> 19:35.140]  live, so maybe I'll try to mash that up
[19:35.140 --> 19:37.320]  in some way. I don't know. Andrew...
[19:37.320 --> 19:39.120]  Andrew, here's what... I'm gonna
[19:39.120 --> 19:41.160]  say something here. I think
[19:41.160 --> 19:43.060]  I think you are a visionary.
[19:43.480 --> 19:45.280]  And I think that what you're...
[19:45.740 --> 19:47.020]  what you've been working on
[19:47.020 --> 19:49.000]  in the lab could be groundbreaking.
[19:49.640 --> 19:51.020]  And I recognize that this is
[19:51.020 --> 19:53.220]  not Eric's other fucking fast food show,
[19:53.420 --> 19:55.060]  so we probably don't want to go too heavy
[19:55.060 --> 19:57.260]  into it, but, like, for instance,
[19:57.340 --> 19:58.520]  the first thing that pops into mind is
[19:58.520 --> 20:00.740]  Emily's family has this
[20:00.740 --> 20:02.320]  Christmas Eve tradition
[20:02.320 --> 20:04.540]  where for Christmas Eve they set out all
[20:04.540 --> 20:06.680]  their fine china, like the nicest
[20:06.680 --> 20:08.440]  plates and knives and shit they have.
[20:08.700 --> 20:10.480]  And by the way, Emily does this at our house too.
[20:10.560 --> 20:11.800]  This is now our family tradition.
[20:12.840 --> 20:14.600]  And then, on Christmas Eve
[20:14.600 --> 20:16.500]  at about 6pm, you drive
[20:16.500 --> 20:18.480]  around to any
[20:18.480 --> 20:19.980]  restaurant you want to go to,
[20:20.140 --> 20:22.460]  any fast food restaurant you want to go to, and get as
[20:22.460 --> 20:24.300]  much as you want. So, like,
[20:24.440 --> 20:26.460]  I get a... I get like
[20:26.460 --> 20:27.620]  I get a
[20:28.840 --> 20:30.640]  big beef and cheddar from Arby's, right?
[20:30.800 --> 20:32.360]  But then I get the fries
[20:33.400 --> 20:34.580]  from McDonald's. And then
[20:34.580 --> 20:35.960]  I get, like, chicken nuggets
[20:37.420 --> 20:38.500]  from... or like a burger
[20:38.500 --> 20:40.320]  from Whataburger, whatever. And you end up going to, like,
[20:40.380 --> 20:42.460]  nine fast food restaurants, and you just get
[20:42.460 --> 20:44.520]  a little bit of everything. And then you go home, and you put
[20:44.520 --> 20:46.480]  it all on your plate, and you eat it like it's a
[20:46.480 --> 20:48.400]  fancy meal. And
[20:48.400 --> 20:50.540]  I've always thought that that was kind of brilliant, and I've really
[20:50.540 --> 20:52.040]  enjoyed the whole process of it.
[20:52.180 --> 20:54.740]  But you've taken it to such another level
[20:54.740 --> 20:56.800]  by mixing and
[20:56.800 --> 20:58.640]  matching within the
[20:58.640 --> 21:00.180]  burger itself. Like,
[21:00.820 --> 21:02.780]  I'll be honest, my brain's kind of exploding
[21:02.780 --> 21:04.800]  with possibility right now. I'm thinking about, like, what can
[21:04.800 --> 21:06.760]  I mash up between Taco Bell and
[21:06.760 --> 21:09.340]  Whataburger? Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting thought.
[21:09.340 --> 21:10.580]  I'm gonna think differently
[21:11.100 --> 21:12.640]  every time I go to a fast food restaurant
[21:12.640 --> 21:14.660]  for the rest of my life because of this. You're gonna think
[21:14.660 --> 21:16.600]  outside the bun. I'm gonna think
[21:16.600 --> 21:18.760]  outside the bun. It's tough, too,
[21:18.780 --> 21:20.680]  because, like, chicken burgers, like, their
[21:20.680 --> 21:22.840]  bun is a different type of texture, typically,
[21:22.840 --> 21:24.660]  than a beef. I don't think I want the
[21:24.660 --> 21:26.740]  chicken burger experience, from a bun
[21:26.740 --> 21:28.720]  perspective, on a beef patty.
[21:28.960 --> 21:30.880]  I don't think that would be good. I could be wrong.
[21:31.140 --> 21:32.840]  Haven't done the science. Haven't tested in the
[21:32.840 --> 21:34.940]  lab yet. Could be wrong,
[21:35.020 --> 21:37.000]  but I think that's how I'm winning. What's the name of
[21:37.000 --> 21:37.940]  your scientist character?
[21:38.960 --> 21:40.680]  It's just me, unfortunately.
[21:41.460 --> 21:42.860]  I sadly just have to live
[21:42.860 --> 21:44.120]  with... this is just me.
[21:45.440 --> 21:46.560]  Gavin, is this something
[21:47.280 --> 21:48.180]  you'd ever do?
[21:49.820 --> 21:50.740]  No. I wouldn't
[21:50.740 --> 21:52.860]  even think to do it. It's phenomenal.
[21:53.600 --> 21:54.660]  I'm just, you know, I'm working
[21:54.660 --> 21:56.720]  things out. And also, I figured
[21:56.720 --> 21:58.560]  we're doing more into... we're doing
[21:58.560 --> 22:00.740]  drafts occasionally. I'm gonna have such
[22:00.740 --> 22:02.760]  a better scouting report than all of you, if we do
[22:02.760 --> 22:04.620]  like a draft. And the same way we did
[22:04.620 --> 22:06.400]  malls, if we did, like,
[22:06.720 --> 22:08.760]  a fast food item draft, and who would
[22:08.760 --> 22:10.540]  have the best restaurant, I would feel very confident.
[22:10.900 --> 22:12.400]  Did we talk about how we recorded those?
[22:12.720 --> 22:14.020]  I don't think we have.
[22:15.000 --> 22:16.700]  I was shocked at how well
[22:16.700 --> 22:18.420]  the mall draft went.
[22:19.420 --> 22:20.320]  Both of them.
[22:20.760 --> 22:22.180]  I was shocked at how
[22:22.180 --> 22:24.380]  different they were. Like, they
[22:24.380 --> 22:26.020]  are entirely different vibes.
[22:26.460 --> 22:28.460]  The rock draft was aggressive
[22:28.460 --> 22:30.280]  and angry and a lot of yelling and
[22:30.280 --> 22:32.380]  screaming, whereas the mall draft was
[22:32.380 --> 22:33.520]  like, weirdly
[22:34.200 --> 22:35.540]  warm and nostalgic.
[22:36.160 --> 22:38.380]  You know? It was insane
[22:38.380 --> 22:40.220]  because we recorded them back to back
[22:40.220 --> 22:42.520]  and what a wild ride it was to be a part
[22:42.520 --> 22:43.740]  of those two recordings.
[22:44.240 --> 22:46.300]  I don't know when they're coming out, but I thought they were both
[22:46.300 --> 22:48.240]  fucking great. And they got me so excited about
[22:48.240 --> 22:50.320]  doing more drafts. Our YouTube channel
[22:50.320 --> 22:52.300]  is pretty action-packed
[22:52.300 --> 22:54.180]  with supplemental stuff now. We've got, like, regulation
[22:54.180 --> 22:56.040]  animation, we've got all the does-it-dos are out,
[22:56.220 --> 22:58.120]  we've got Condorman to come out still,
[22:58.300 --> 22:59.800]  we've got the drafts.
[23:01.140 --> 23:01.860]  It's, uh...
[23:01.860 --> 23:04.240]  It's full of stuff that isn't in this podcast, which I think is
[23:04.240 --> 23:06.300]  great. Yeah, me too. And we've got
[23:07.520 --> 23:08.360]  probably not ready to
[23:08.360 --> 23:10.180]  dive into it now, but Eric and I have been
[23:10.180 --> 23:12.180]  thinking about this idea for, like, a
[23:12.180 --> 23:14.000]  baseball-type thing we want to do
[23:14.560 --> 23:16.320]  that could potentially be more
[23:16.320 --> 23:17.960]  supplemental content. With a lot of
[23:17.960 --> 23:20.120]  irons in the fire. We've got a six-foot hole
[23:20.120 --> 23:22.360]  to dig in the backyard, we've got a Jason Bourne
[23:22.360 --> 23:24.220]  and some buses. We've got a lot of stuff
[23:24.220 --> 23:25.200]  on the horizon as well.
[23:27.100 --> 23:28.140]  We've got to do the
[23:28.140 --> 23:29.800]  tuxedo thing, too. Yeah.
[23:30.100 --> 23:31.940]  Like, there's so much
[23:31.940 --> 23:34.160]  for this show that it just is
[23:34.160 --> 23:36.120]  like half an idea that becomes something
[23:36.120 --> 23:37.680]  where I go, man, that was fun.
[23:37.980 --> 23:40.040]  Like, it just ends up being
[23:40.040 --> 23:41.260]  so much fun.
[23:41.260 --> 23:43.200]  And I'm glad we just do it.
[23:43.280 --> 23:45.540]  I'm really glad we just do it. It's always a good time.
[23:45.840 --> 23:46.780]  We're like Nike.
[23:49.360 --> 23:49.800]  Okay.
[23:50.720 --> 23:52.720]  Does it do it? Just do it.
[23:52.960 --> 23:55.180]  It was very clever of me.
[23:55.540 --> 23:56.820]  Speaking of just doing it
[23:56.820 --> 23:58.080]  and making fun stuff,
[23:58.960 --> 24:00.760]  Andrew, give me a number between 1 and 30.
[24:01.220 --> 24:01.660]  5.
[24:03.760 --> 24:04.200]  Gavin,
[24:04.880 --> 24:06.500]  give me a number between 1 and 30.
[24:06.900 --> 24:07.340]  16.
[24:07.340 --> 24:07.560]  16.
[24:08.800 --> 24:10.780]  Eric? Lucky 13.
[24:11.080 --> 24:11.980]  13. Nick?
[24:12.560 --> 24:13.040]  21.
[24:14.540 --> 24:17.340]  21. Okay. I'm going to pick...
[24:17.900 --> 24:18.240]  Nah.
[24:19.220 --> 24:20.740]  I'm going to pick...
[24:21.420 --> 24:22.440]  27. Okay.
[24:22.960 --> 24:24.720]  So, those are the...
[24:25.120 --> 24:26.820]  when I prepare the new bingo cards.
[24:26.940 --> 24:29.280]  Because tonight we are recording...
[24:29.280 --> 24:31.220]  I mean, it'll be way in the past
[24:31.220 --> 24:32.920]  by the time you're listening to this, but tonight we're recording
[24:32.920 --> 24:34.860]  our first test of Sloppy Joe's
[24:35.620 --> 24:36.680]  bingo. We're going to do that.
[24:36.820 --> 24:38.660]  And so those are the numbers of the bingo cards
[24:38.660 --> 24:39.640]  I'm going to print out for you guys.
[24:39.800 --> 24:42.800]  I make 30 at a time, so those are the ones
[24:42.800 --> 24:43.880]  you guys will get for the event tonight.
[24:44.180 --> 24:44.940]  I can't wait.
[24:45.980 --> 24:48.700]  I wrote down 37 for me. It's 27.
[24:48.840 --> 24:49.880]  What the fuck is wrong with me?
[24:51.820 --> 24:53.000]  It doesn't even go that high.
[24:58.420 --> 25:00.180]  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[25:00.640 --> 25:02.080]  It is so important
[25:02.080 --> 25:03.580]  to make sure you have time
[25:03.580 --> 25:05.780]  to cater to your feelings and your needs.
[25:05.780 --> 25:07.620]  There are times in life where
[25:07.620 --> 25:09.840]  maybe there's a situation where you're trying to support
[25:09.840 --> 25:11.940]  somebody. That takes a lot
[25:11.940 --> 25:14.020]  out of you, but it's just so important
[25:14.020 --> 25:15.900]  to make sure that you're also taking care of yourself.
[25:16.320 --> 25:17.700]  Because it's so easy to get
[25:17.700 --> 25:19.620]  caught up in what everyone else needs from you
[25:19.620 --> 25:21.720]  and never take a moment to think about what
[25:21.720 --> 25:23.380]  you need from yourself.
[25:23.860 --> 25:25.600]  But when we spend all of our time giving,
[25:25.720 --> 25:27.580]  it can leave us feeling stretched thin and
[25:27.580 --> 25:29.720]  burned out. Therapy can give you the
[25:29.720 --> 25:31.700]  tools to find more balance in your life so you
[25:31.700 --> 25:33.800]  can keep supporting others without leaving yourself
[25:33.800 --> 25:35.780]  behind. Therapy
[25:35.780 --> 25:37.780]  is an incredible thing. I would highly
[25:37.780 --> 25:39.760]  recommend it to anyone. I think
[25:39.760 --> 25:41.980]  it's just a really important and healthy process
[25:41.980 --> 25:43.860]  to go through. So if you're thinking

[26:13.440 --> 26:15.260]  Using the internet without ExpressVPN
[26:15.260 --> 26:17.140]  is like leaving your laptop exposed at the
[26:17.140 --> 26:19.180]  coffee shop table while you run to the bathroom.
[26:19.360 --> 26:21.220]  Most of the time you're probably fine, but what
[26:21.220 --> 26:22.740]  if one day you come out of the bathroom
[26:22.740 --> 26:24.820]  and your laptop is gone?
[26:25.520 --> 26:27.260]  That would suck. I also think it's interesting
[26:27.260 --> 26:29.200]  that any table in a
[26:29.200 --> 26:31.100]  coffee shop is a coffee shop table, but
[26:31.100 --> 26:33.020]  when they say coffee shop table, I pictured
[26:33.020 --> 26:34.960]  something very specific.
[26:36.140 --> 26:37.340]  Anyway, every time
[26:37.340 --> 26:39.100]  you connect to an unencrypted network, cafes,
[26:39.300 --> 26:41.320]  hotels, airports, any hacker on the same
[26:41.320 --> 26:43.220]  network can gain access to your
[26:43.220 --> 26:45.100]  personal data. Passwords,
[26:45.260 --> 26:47.220]  financial details, etc. All the terrible
[26:47.220 --> 26:48.620]  things you don't want stolen.
[26:49.180 --> 26:51.140]  It doesn't take much technical knowledge to know
[26:51.140 --> 26:53.360]  how to hack someone. Just some cheap hardware is needed.
[26:53.820 --> 26:55.280]  A smart 12-year-old could
[26:55.280 --> 26:57.120]  do it. I certainly didn't
[26:57.120 --> 26:58.860]  fall into that category as a 12-year-old.
[26:59.160 --> 26:59.620]  Or even now.
[27:00.800 --> 27:03.080]  Your data is valuable. Hackers can make up to
[27:03.080 --> 27:05.300]  $1,000 per person selling personal
[27:05.300 --> 27:07.260]  info on the dark web.
[27:07.900 --> 27:08.860]  Why use ExpressVPN?
[27:09.460 --> 27:10.980]  It has an encrypted tunnel.
[27:11.120 --> 27:13.000]  It creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your
[27:13.000 --> 27:14.980]  device and the internet. Hackers
[27:14.980 --> 27:16.440]  can't steal your sensitive data.
[27:17.100 --> 27:19.040]  It's super secure. It'd take a hacker
[27:19.040 --> 27:20.980]  with a supercomputer over a billion
[27:20.980 --> 27:23.160]  years to get past ExpressVPN's encryption.
[27:23.900 --> 27:25.140]  It's easy to use.
[27:25.140 --> 27:26.880]  All you have to do is fire up the app and click
[27:26.880 --> 27:28.300]  one button to get protected.
[27:28.560 --> 27:30.960]  And it works on all of your devices. Phones,
[27:31.140 --> 27:32.300]  laptops, tablets, and more.
[27:32.680 --> 27:35.160]  So you can stay secure on the go.
[27:35.580 --> 27:37.100]  ExpressVPN is a great
[27:37.100 --> 27:38.540]  service for protection.
[27:38.880 --> 27:41.060]  I've used it to view other
[27:41.060 --> 27:42.680]  content libraries in different countries.
[27:43.320 --> 27:45.260]  I watched The Spelling Bee on it last year.
[27:45.800 --> 27:47.020]  There's all sorts of great
[27:47.020 --> 27:48.480]  reasons to use ExpressVPN.
[27:48.960 --> 27:51.160]  So if you want to secure your online data today

[28:06.020 --> 28:07.440]  Today's episode is sponsored
[28:07.440 --> 28:09.400]  by Honey. The easy way to save
[28:09.400 --> 28:11.580]  when shopping on your iPhone or computer.
[28:11.780 --> 28:13.360]  Now it's always great when
[28:13.360 --> 28:15.160]  you have a deal, but it's even better
[28:15.160 --> 28:16.680]  when you didn't even expect it.
[28:16.920 --> 28:19.180]  Thanks to Honey, manually searching for
[28:19.180 --> 28:20.920]  coupon codes is a thing of the past.
[28:20.920 --> 28:22.880]  Honey is the free shopping tool
[28:22.880 --> 28:24.840]  that scours the internet for promo codes and
[28:24.840 --> 28:26.740]  applies the best one it finds to your cart.
[28:27.440 --> 28:28.960]  Now, imagine you're shopping on
[28:28.960 --> 28:30.860]  one of your favorite sites. When you
[28:30.860 --> 28:32.940]  check out, the Honey button appears and all you have
[28:32.940 --> 28:34.680]  to do is click Apply Coupons.
[28:35.200 --> 28:36.860]  Wait a few seconds as Honey searches for
[28:36.860 --> 28:38.320]  coupons it can find for that site.
[28:38.920 --> 28:40.700]  If Honey finds a working coupon,
[28:41.140 --> 28:42.460]  you'll watch the prices drop.
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.080]  I've used Honey to save on all sorts of things
[28:45.080 --> 28:46.400]  from clothing to tech.
[28:46.840 --> 28:49.020]  It's so easy to use. I would highly recommend it.
[28:49.020 --> 28:50.980]  And did you know that Honey doesn't just
[28:50.980 --> 28:52.900]  work on desktops? It works on your
[28:52.900 --> 28:54.980]  iPhone too. Just activate it on
[28:54.980 --> 28:57.040]  Safari on your phone and save on the go.
[28:57.620 --> 28:58.940]  If you don't already have Honey,
[28:59.040 --> 29:00.360]  you could be straight up missing out.
[29:00.760 --> 29:02.660]  And by getting it, you'll be doing yourself a solid

[29:11.000 --> 29:11.560]  face.
[29:13.880 --> 29:14.760]  Not to...
[29:14.760 --> 29:16.880]  I mean, we kind of ventured past it, but to return for a minute,
[29:16.880 --> 29:18.760]  we did both drafts. One of them was very
[29:18.760 --> 29:20.820]  argumentative, and one of them, I think,
[29:20.860 --> 29:22.260]  was very supportive and sweet.
[29:22.780 --> 29:24.220]  And I think it was argumentative,
[29:24.760 --> 29:26.860]  rightfully so, because there's some insane picks
[29:26.860 --> 29:28.180]  taken, in my opinion,
[29:28.680 --> 29:30.520]  in the first draft. Eric, could we
[29:31.260 --> 29:32.980]  potentially tweet what people
[29:32.980 --> 29:34.740]  think should be the first
[29:34.740 --> 29:36.780]  overall pick in the Rock Not Rock draft and
[29:36.780 --> 29:38.540]  see if any of them line up?
[29:38.560 --> 29:40.920]  I mean, do you want me to give what the first picks were
[29:40.920 --> 29:42.840]  in the choice, or what do you want me to list?
[29:42.860 --> 29:44.760]  No, I just, like, maybe just have people
[29:44.760 --> 29:46.820]  reply. Also, last
[29:46.820 --> 29:48.820]  week when we did this, I made a joke of
[29:48.820 --> 29:50.840]  that I wanted a recount on the weirdness
[29:50.840 --> 29:52.780]  thing, because I should have a
[29:52.780 --> 29:54.540]  higher percentage of the vote. We
[29:54.540 --> 29:56.800]  stopped recording, and the first thing
[29:56.800 --> 29:58.760]  I did was, everyone left, and I
[29:58.760 --> 30:00.940]  opened Twitter, and that was the top of my feed
[30:00.940 --> 30:02.820]  was that poll. And I was just, you son of
[30:02.820 --> 30:04.140]  a bitch. God damn it.
[30:04.620 --> 30:06.740]  You actually did it. I did, and I had
[30:06.740 --> 30:09.060]  a higher percent of the vote. It was exactly...
[30:09.060 --> 30:10.860]  73.6%
[30:11.800 --> 30:12.760]  says Andrew is
[30:12.760 --> 30:14.720]  the weird one. Which, you know,
[30:14.800 --> 30:16.720]  I think this episode, especially,
[30:16.960 --> 30:18.080]  it's probably 78.
[30:18.700 --> 30:20.780]  If we did another count. But I
[30:20.780 --> 30:22.980]  just like to see. I don't think any person
[30:22.980 --> 30:23.860]  will take
[30:24.680 --> 30:26.620]  as the first overall pick
[30:26.620 --> 30:28.140]  of the Not Rock Draft.
[30:28.580 --> 30:30.740]  We might have to bleep that if the
[30:30.740 --> 30:32.620]  Rock Draft isn't out by then. Yeah, we should
[30:32.620 --> 30:34.840]  bleep. Clearly, I had
[30:34.840 --> 30:36.540]  to pick it first, because
[30:36.540 --> 30:38.740]  clearly somebody else also wanted to
[30:38.740 --> 30:39.360]  pick it first.
[30:42.180 --> 30:42.580]  We
[30:42.580 --> 30:43.340]  shouldn't go further.
[30:43.500 --> 30:45.400]  But I just, I'd love to see a
[30:45.400 --> 30:47.400]  Twitter thing and wanted to call out the fact
[30:47.400 --> 30:49.520]  that I love that you did that. I was annoyed
[30:49.520 --> 30:50.600]  but also appreciated.
[30:51.740 --> 30:53.460]  So, I'm gonna put this tweet out right
[30:53.460 --> 30:55.320]  now. Is it, what should be
[30:55.320 --> 30:57.340]  the first pick in the Rock Not Rock Draft?
[30:57.520 --> 30:59.680]  Yeah, I think it'd be like, what's your prediction
[30:59.680 --> 31:01.460]  on, or what would you pick?
[31:01.600 --> 31:03.300]  What would be your first overall pick?
[31:04.200 --> 31:05.560]  In a Rock Not Rock Draft.
[31:05.560 --> 31:07.460]  Yeah, in a Rock Not Rock Draft. Rocks Not Rocks.
[31:07.960 --> 31:08.800]  Rocks Not Rocks.
[31:09.960 --> 31:10.560]  I think
[31:11.160 --> 31:13.360]  we were coming at it from different angles, because like, you
[31:13.360 --> 31:15.440]  were trying to pick the legitimate best
[31:15.440 --> 31:17.500]  Rock Not Rock in the world, and I
[31:17.500 --> 31:19.500]  was going only for comedy, and
[31:19.500 --> 31:20.840]  to pick stuff nobody else picked.
[31:21.080 --> 31:22.500]  But it was on everyone's board.
[31:23.180 --> 31:25.260]  I was so fucking surprised
[31:25.260 --> 31:27.460]  that my pick, that that pick was on other boards.
[31:27.520 --> 31:28.980]  I really didn't think anybody else would pick it.
[31:29.940 --> 31:31.340]  I wasn't even sure
[31:31.340 --> 31:33.480]  that everybody knew what it was.
[31:35.740 --> 31:36.420]  It's like an
[31:36.420 --> 31:38.480]  old ass thing from my childhood that I
[31:38.480 --> 31:40.200]  assume is still around, but I don't think they're
[31:40.200 --> 31:41.580]  super popular in 2023.
[31:42.260 --> 31:44.140]  I would love to see people
[31:44.140 --> 31:46.220]  trying to guess what you're talking about now, because
[31:46.220 --> 31:48.300]  we bleeped me saying what it is.
[31:48.320 --> 31:50.160]  Just like all the context clues of
[31:50.160 --> 31:51.980]  if people will be able to accurately guess
[31:51.980 --> 31:53.640]  the item that you're talking about.
[31:54.440 --> 31:56.220]  Anyway, those are going to be great.
[31:56.360 --> 31:57.840]  I'm excited for people to listen to them.
[31:58.140 --> 32:00.260]  And I'm excited for Sloppy Joes tonight. I'm going to be honest,
[32:00.300 --> 32:02.120]  I haven't watched a single
[32:02.120 --> 32:04.000]  second of a Sloppy Joes live stream.
[32:04.260 --> 32:06.140]  I've been waiting. So this is going to be my
[32:06.140 --> 32:08.060]  first experience. Let me
[32:08.060 --> 32:10.440]  preface this by saying that we're doing it at 8 o'clock
[32:10.900 --> 32:11.340]  Central.
[32:12.120 --> 32:13.840]  So it'll be 6 o'clock your time. It's
[32:13.840 --> 32:15.540]  9 o'clock Sloppy Joes time.
[32:16.100 --> 32:17.920]  Slop o'clock is 11
[32:17.920 --> 32:18.540]  15.
[32:19.760 --> 32:21.200]  So why are we doing it early?
[32:21.880 --> 32:23.440]  I think because people have to
[32:23.920 --> 32:26.040]  have lives and shit and probably want to go to bed
[32:26.040 --> 32:27.980]  and stuff. But I'm just saying some of the
[32:27.980 --> 32:30.060]  wilder behavior may happen more
[32:30.060 --> 32:31.880]  towards the end. Like the chance of us seeing
[32:31.880 --> 32:33.980]  somebody throw up are better at 11pm than
[32:33.980 --> 32:36.120]  they are at 9pm. But it should still be
[32:36.120 --> 32:37.680]  fun. It should still be a good time.
[32:38.340 --> 32:40.000]  Okay. I just, if it's not
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.160]  as rambunctious as we've
[32:42.160 --> 32:43.920]  made it sound, it may just be because
[32:43.920 --> 32:45.900]  it's 9pm on a Thursday night.
[32:46.000 --> 32:47.560]  And I just, I don't know.
[32:48.080 --> 32:49.880]  I just, I can't guarantee how
[32:49.880 --> 32:50.980]  drunk those idiots will be.
[32:51.500 --> 32:53.740]  First reply by Daniel Rolls
[32:53.740 --> 32:55.820]  on the Rock Not Rock draft.
[32:56.780 --> 32:57.840]  From the seaside.
[32:57.840 --> 32:59.620]  Don't know if they have that outside the UK.
[32:59.640 --> 33:01.840]  I looked it up and it is...
[33:03.080 --> 33:03.900]  It's what Gavin
[33:03.900 --> 33:05.860]  drafted. That was my first pick.
[33:06.100 --> 33:07.680]  And it would be...
[33:08.700 --> 33:09.400]  I've noticed
[33:09.400 --> 33:10.520]  it's a terrible pick.
[33:11.840 --> 33:13.820]  No, it's cool because they put
[33:13.820 --> 33:15.900]  letters through it. Can you
[33:15.900 --> 33:17.740]  mute that person from the account
[33:17.740 --> 33:19.700]  Eric? Because they have zero good takes.
[33:20.220 --> 33:21.700]  You don't need to see whatever they're saying.
[33:22.060 --> 33:23.860]  And I say that respectfully to whoever that is.
[33:24.060 --> 33:25.780]  It's the first, are you fucking serious?
[33:25.780 --> 33:27.840]  The first comment was that?
[33:28.240 --> 33:29.860]  I opened, I tweeted it, I gave it a
[33:29.860 --> 33:31.060]  second, I went back, look,
[33:31.340 --> 33:34.060]  A number 1, saw it right there, and it's...
[33:34.060 --> 33:36.060]  I don't, I don't, I gotta
[33:36.060 --> 33:37.860]  I'm opening, I don't believe that you
[33:37.860 --> 33:39.020]  did not plant this at some point.
[33:39.220 --> 33:42.000]  I don't know who this, I don't know who Daniel Rolls is.
[33:42.040 --> 33:43.360]  I don't talk to these fucking people.
[33:43.740 --> 33:45.900]  Well, I just, I, the tweet itself, I'm saying
[33:45.900 --> 33:47.360]  I feel like there's gotta, let me...
[33:47.360 --> 33:49.800]  Well, I got blown away by that and 2 out of the 5 of us
[33:49.800 --> 33:50.700]  also did it.
[33:52.240 --> 33:53.800]  Well, yeah, but because I
[33:53.800 --> 33:55.260]  expect that from you guys.
[33:55.380 --> 33:58.000]  I have a lower bar here than I do everywhere else.
[33:58.000 --> 33:59.520]  Clearly you didn't expect it from us based on your reaction.
[33:59.740 --> 34:01.860]  No, you hit a new low, you're right, that's actually
[34:01.860 --> 34:03.720]  a fair statement. You did hit, the bar
[34:03.720 --> 34:05.520]  went lower, I assumed it was on the ground.
[34:05.740 --> 34:08.080]  That is a terrible pick. 13 replies.
[34:10.000 --> 34:10.400]  Uh...
[34:10.400 --> 34:11.220]  Okay, you know what?
[34:12.140 --> 34:13.300]  Respectfully to Jess,
[34:13.800 --> 34:15.660]  whatever, uh, they said the
[34:15.660 --> 34:17.500]  phrase, that rocks, that's a worse pick.
[34:17.780 --> 34:19.800]  That's an even, I thought you had a
[34:19.800 --> 34:21.400]  bad one, maybe I was too critical
[34:21.400 --> 34:22.360]  on your pick.
[34:23.360 --> 34:25.900]  Drafting that rocks is horrendous
[34:25.900 --> 34:27.000]  as a first overall.
[34:28.780 --> 34:30.260]  I have never
[34:30.260 --> 34:31.340]  seen somebody
[34:31.340 --> 34:33.400]  so opinionated about rocks
[34:33.400 --> 34:35.480]  in my life. His opinions
[34:35.480 --> 34:36.820]  are so strong.
[34:37.260 --> 34:38.700]  I mean, Geoff, they're not rocks.
[34:38.900 --> 34:42.020]  He's like Hank on Breaking Bad.
[34:45.760 --> 34:47.520]  It's fun to have really
[34:47.520 --> 34:49.500]  strong opinions on things that shouldn't have
[34:49.500 --> 34:51.240]  opinions on. I'm almost certainly wrong.
[34:51.340 --> 34:53.300]  There's no data, I can't prove that I'm right.
[34:53.980 --> 34:55.640]  It's just opinion. I just think
[34:55.640 --> 34:57.580]  from my perspective, from my
[34:57.580 --> 34:59.680]  life experience, that's a terrible pick.
[35:00.540 --> 35:01.280]  We're, um,
[35:01.720 --> 35:03.480]  we're half an hour in and I'm still staring at
[35:03.480 --> 35:05.500]  the shit. Okay, we need to
[35:06.480 --> 35:07.320]  Huff some ice.
[35:07.780 --> 35:08.600]  Huff some ice.
[35:09.080 --> 35:11.020]  Oh God, so are you gonna go with the idea?
[35:11.100 --> 35:12.840]  That apple looks a little rough.
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.520]  Let me say something. That is way
[35:15.520 --> 35:17.980]  older than the apple milliate, I guarantee you.
[35:17.980 --> 35:19.980]  At least the apple hadn't started to eat itself
[35:19.980 --> 35:22.300]  yet like that. Yeah, this is shriveled.
[35:22.340 --> 35:24.200]  I don't know how long
[35:24.200 --> 35:25.820]  it's been shriveled. Okay,
[35:25.980 --> 35:28.080]  so will the apple, you think, make you gag
[35:28.080 --> 35:30.220]  if you cut it open? Are we gonna get a double gag?
[35:30.660 --> 35:32.100]  Fuck off. God damn it,
[35:32.120 --> 35:33.380]  Nick. It's every
[35:34.040 --> 35:35.140]  comment. Oh God.
[35:35.580 --> 35:38.100]  I might be in a minority here. So I
[35:38.100 --> 35:40.160]  think you start with
[35:40.920 --> 35:42.080]  the ice and
[35:42.080 --> 35:43.720]  then you do the apple second. Yeah.
[35:43.980 --> 35:46.020]  Okay, so I'm gonna take the
[35:46.020 --> 35:47.040]  lid off this Gerpler.
[35:48.080 --> 35:50.020]  Video, please. Video it. Oh, can you?
[35:50.340 --> 35:51.880]  Can you give me a second? Like, don't
[35:51.880 --> 35:54.160]  do it yet. Just get your... Can you live stream
[35:54.160 --> 35:56.080]  your video or is that not possible? I don't have
[35:56.080 --> 35:57.840]  a webcam. Oh, that's okay.
[35:58.280 --> 35:59.460]  Then never mind.
[36:00.560 --> 36:01.220]  No, it's okay.
[36:02.160 --> 36:03.920]  It's okay. It's not a big deal. Yep.
[36:04.840 --> 36:05.820]  I don't wanna slow the bit down.
[36:06.700 --> 36:07.900]  Alright, so I'm just gonna huff
[36:07.900 --> 36:09.540]  this ice.
[36:10.120 --> 36:12.060]  I wanna see if it makes you gag. Okay, here we go.
[36:12.080 --> 36:13.880]  You ready? Three,
[36:13.880 --> 36:15.080]  two, one.
[36:21.080 --> 36:22.420]  Even if you don't gag,
[36:22.520 --> 36:23.700]  that's so pained.
[36:25.720 --> 36:26.640]  You okay?
[36:30.060 --> 36:32.000]  I hear you laughing in it.
[36:32.120 --> 36:33.920]  Now I'm just laughing into a cup of ice.
[36:38.600 --> 36:39.800]  No, no gag.
[36:40.580 --> 36:41.820]  Wow, okay.
[36:42.260 --> 36:44.680]  So maybe it's more to do with, like, your body
[36:44.680 --> 36:46.320]  that is, you know,
[36:46.380 --> 36:48.340]  cold. Actually,
[36:48.340 --> 36:49.920]  the air wasn't that cold.
[36:55.660 --> 36:56.480]  So now you're
[36:56.480 --> 36:58.480]  gonna cut into the apple? What's the plan with the apple?
[36:58.700 --> 37:00.100]  I think you should just take a bite.
[37:00.480 --> 37:01.420]  Am I just biting it?
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.100]  You bite in. You're gonna
[37:04.100 --> 37:06.220]  vomit in that. I mean, if you wanna film yourself
[37:06.220 --> 37:08.500]  on your phone, that's cool. You don't have to.
[37:08.760 --> 37:09.760]  Oh, I'm doing that already.
[37:10.140 --> 37:11.200]  Oh, great. Okay.
[37:12.080 --> 37:13.580]  Dear, oh dear. This is...
[37:13.580 --> 37:15.840]  This doesn't feel like something I wanna bite.
[37:15.840 --> 37:18.200]  You know, it doesn't look like something you'd wanna bite.
[37:18.300 --> 37:19.740]  Go ahead. Here we go.
[37:20.520 --> 37:21.180]  Down the hatch.
[37:24.920 --> 37:25.340]  Oh.
[37:27.040 --> 37:27.760]  Oh, dear.
[37:29.080 --> 37:30.060]  Now you rated
[37:30.060 --> 37:32.040]  the apple kinda low to begin with.
[37:32.160 --> 37:33.020]  I think you gave it a five.
[37:34.080 --> 37:35.260]  It's like sour grit.
[37:36.220 --> 37:37.180]  Sour grit?
[37:37.820 --> 37:40.000]  Oh, God. You're handling this better
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.240]  than I anticipated. Try the other side.
[37:42.960 --> 37:43.360]  Oh, yes.
[37:43.700 --> 37:44.740]  Going for the other side.
[37:46.140 --> 37:46.660]  Hold on.
[37:46.740 --> 37:48.000]  Let me swallow this. Should I swallow this?
[37:48.340 --> 37:50.240]  No, no, no, no. Don't swallow it.
[37:50.240 --> 37:52.380]  Spit it out. Just spit it into the ice.
[37:52.940 --> 37:54.160]  Okay. Bite in the other side.
[37:55.340 --> 37:55.960]  Oh, it's soft.
[37:58.140 --> 37:58.440]  Oh.
[37:58.780 --> 37:59.060]  Oh.
[38:00.980 --> 38:01.580]  Oh, yeah.
[38:02.720 --> 38:02.940]  Wow.
[38:04.200 --> 38:06.420]  Yeah? It sounds worse.
[38:07.180 --> 38:07.920]  That was like
[38:07.920 --> 38:10.900]  just grit. Like, all the flavor is in the other side.
[38:11.120 --> 38:12.460]  That was just empty apple.
[38:12.460 --> 38:14.560]  That's like, if someone was designing an apple
[38:14.560 --> 38:16.140]  and they just wanted, like, the matter,
[38:17.000 --> 38:18.680]  the apple shell,
[38:19.080 --> 38:20.080]  that's just what that is.
[38:20.120 --> 38:21.740]  It's just empty flavored apple.
[38:22.320 --> 38:24.480]  Now, do you think, like, the flavor died
[38:24.480 --> 38:26.380]  on that side, or did the party move
[38:26.380 --> 38:28.300]  all to the other side of the apple?
[38:28.300 --> 38:30.480]  I think the party sort of seeped into the other side.
[38:30.920 --> 38:31.980]  I see. Interesting.
[38:32.300 --> 38:34.260]  So it's an even more flavorful bite
[38:34.260 --> 38:36.260]  than it originally was, is what you're saying.
[38:36.260 --> 38:36.540]  Oh!
[38:38.640 --> 38:39.420]  I'm gonna...
[38:39.420 --> 38:41.500]  I can't stare at this. I'm gonna throw it away.
[38:42.360 --> 38:43.580]  Yeah. Yeah. Please do.
[38:43.600 --> 38:44.700]  That's fair. You did the research.
[38:45.200 --> 38:47.320]  And for a guy who gags all the time,
[38:47.760 --> 38:49.500]  uh, congratulations on not throwing up.
[38:49.540 --> 38:51.600]  I violently vomited
[38:51.600 --> 38:52.400]  when I tried mine.
[38:52.640 --> 38:55.320]  Yours was worse,
[38:55.440 --> 38:56.060]  I would say.
[38:56.820 --> 38:59.360]  A bad apple's a bad apple. I'm just saying
[38:59.360 --> 39:01.140]  kudos to Gavin for holding it together.
[39:01.140 --> 39:02.660]  Oh, absolutely. Definite kudos.
[39:03.440 --> 39:04.920]  You also like the apple more.
[39:05.480 --> 39:07.260]  And the fact that he started from a position
[39:07.260 --> 39:08.940]  of not being the biggest fan of it.
[39:09.140 --> 39:11.660]  Mine wasn't melted as much as Geoff's, though.
[39:12.000 --> 39:13.400]  That seems to have...
[39:13.400 --> 39:15.180]  Yeah, yours seems to be maintaining
[39:15.180 --> 39:17.220]  an apple consistency and shape, whereas
[39:17.220 --> 39:18.580]  mine was soup.
[39:19.500 --> 39:21.260]  Yeah, that was honestly... I wish I'd waited another
[39:21.260 --> 39:23.020]  six months on that, because that was...
[39:23.020 --> 39:25.280]  I think that still had some time, but it just wasn't good.
[39:25.980 --> 39:26.880]  I feel like
[39:27.440 --> 39:28.640]  if you were to wager,
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.320]  if somebody said, what will make this guy
[39:31.320 --> 39:33.440]  gag? Biting into a 14
[39:33.440 --> 39:35.040]  month old apple, or
[39:35.040 --> 39:37.100]  walking outside when it's hot
[39:37.100 --> 39:39.180]  to cold, I don't think many people
[39:39.180 --> 39:40.740]  are taking the hot to cold.
[39:41.100 --> 39:43.020]  It's shocking to me that
[39:43.020 --> 39:44.800]  you have just walked through
[39:44.800 --> 39:47.100]  this 14, 15 month
[39:47.100 --> 39:48.440]  old apple, I'm assuming.
[39:48.840 --> 39:49.960]  It doesn't look good.
[39:51.340 --> 39:52.820]  It does not look good.
[39:53.360 --> 39:55.160]  Are you okay, Gavin? Are you recovering?
[39:55.720 --> 39:57.020]  I had to get a palate cleanser.
[39:57.440 --> 39:59.020]  That's fair. It's
[39:59.020 --> 40:00.960]  really weird to be on the other side of this.
[40:01.060 --> 40:02.980]  I almost, in every other point of
[40:02.980 --> 40:04.780]  doing something like this, I am in the Gavin
[40:04.780 --> 40:06.960]  role. This might be a first, where we're just
[40:06.960 --> 40:07.500]  observing.
[40:08.160 --> 40:11.040]  Eric asked a great question, what did you get?
[40:11.700 --> 40:12.840]  Yeah, what's the cleanser?
[40:13.460 --> 40:14.880]  Just a handful of granola.
[40:15.920 --> 40:16.360]  Pffft.
[40:17.980 --> 40:19.200]  What's funny about that?
[40:19.520 --> 40:21.280]  Just grabbing a handful
[40:21.280 --> 40:23.060]  of granola? You live a fun
[40:23.060 --> 40:24.860]  life. What a weird
[40:25.740 --> 40:26.180]  handful.
[40:26.780 --> 40:28.880]  I just looked in the little pantry
[40:28.880 --> 40:30.360]  and grabbed a handful of something.
[40:31.520 --> 40:32.220]  What's wrong with that?
[40:33.000 --> 40:34.280]  It's fine, I guess.
[40:34.340 --> 40:36.400]  I've never heard of anyone say, I've just got a handful
[40:36.400 --> 40:38.440]  of granola. I'm gonna wash this apple down
[40:38.440 --> 40:39.220]  with some granola.
[40:39.420 --> 40:41.900]  You just washed down a year old apple.
[40:42.300 --> 40:42.940]  That's true.
[40:43.720 --> 40:45.740]  Do you think that would be the ideal pairing?
[40:45.940 --> 40:47.580]  How did the granola go with the apple?
[40:47.740 --> 40:49.020]  It made the granola taste pretty good.
[40:49.320 --> 40:51.140]  So it's like a flavor enhancer.
[40:52.340 --> 40:54.600]  Looking for you, Gavin. I'm surprised you didn't gag.
[40:54.660 --> 40:56.300]  I would have bet anything that at least one
[40:56.300 --> 40:57.760]  of those things would have made you gag.
[40:57.760 --> 41:00.080]  Yeah, I'm disappointed I didn't.
[41:00.080 --> 41:01.820]  I feel like I've gagged many times in this podcast
[41:01.820 --> 41:02.820]  and I assumed that would be one.
[41:03.120 --> 41:06.120]  I mean, you can brush your teeth on the podcast
[41:06.120 --> 41:07.500]  and we'll definitely get it then.
[41:07.920 --> 41:08.680]  Oh, God.
[41:11.120 --> 41:12.060]  Next time I'll get a
[41:12.060 --> 41:13.940]  mic cable long enough to get into the
[41:13.940 --> 41:15.880]  bathroom. If we ever need to do
[41:15.880 --> 41:17.820]  another morning with f*** face, a waking
[41:17.820 --> 41:19.540]  up with f*** face like we did before,
[41:19.700 --> 41:21.720]  that would be great. Everybody brushes their teeth.
[41:21.760 --> 41:23.420]  That would be so horrible to listen to.
[41:23.580 --> 41:25.600]  Never mind. Scrapping that idea.
[41:26.220 --> 41:27.940]  Everybody brushing their teeth into the mic.
[41:28.760 --> 41:30.020]  Could you imagine
[41:30.020 --> 41:31.520]  if we had... and I'm not
[41:31.520 --> 41:33.340]  advocating that we do this at all.
[41:34.680 --> 41:36.000]  It's just fun to play with the idea.
[41:36.320 --> 41:37.860]  Could you imagine if we had our own version of
[41:37.860 --> 41:39.660]  Good Morning America? It was like
[41:39.660 --> 41:41.620]  good morning f*** face and
[41:41.620 --> 41:43.760]  it's like wake up with f*** face and we
[41:43.760 --> 41:45.900]  tell you about the soft news of the morning
[41:45.900 --> 41:47.760]  and then we try a little recipe with
[41:47.760 --> 41:49.380]  Shaq or whatever and then
[41:49.820 --> 41:51.880]  or like Gordon Ramsay comes on to show
[41:51.880 --> 41:53.760]  off some fritters and teaches you how to make them
[41:53.760 --> 41:55.680]  but it's just like us
[41:56.100 --> 41:57.280]  but Good Morning America.
[41:57.860 --> 41:59.880]  What do you mean? Your idea is to
[41:59.880 --> 42:01.880]  take a very rigid segmented
[42:01.880 --> 42:04.020]  program and just have
[42:04.020 --> 42:05.720]  at it? Yeah, like
[42:05.720 --> 42:06.800]  what would our version of it be?
[42:08.360 --> 42:09.980]  Like we'd be making a plowman's
[42:09.980 --> 42:11.720]  pizza with Hoda
[42:11.720 --> 42:13.000]  and f***ing
[42:13.500 --> 42:15.600]  Kathy Lee or whatever. I don't know.
[42:16.040 --> 42:16.800]  I just think it would be funny.
[42:17.920 --> 42:19.740]  I wonder what our dynamic would
[42:19.740 --> 42:21.740]  be like. I remember what it was like that one morning
[42:21.740 --> 42:23.700]  but if we had a...
[42:23.700 --> 42:25.620]  I'm not saying we should do it. I don't want to do it. I'm just saying.
[42:25.700 --> 42:26.720]  It's just like theater of the mind.
[42:27.480 --> 42:29.620]  I feel like it's what we're doing but less funny
[42:29.620 --> 42:31.800]  in my head. Like it wouldn't
[42:31.800 --> 42:33.040]  be as good. I don't know what the
[42:33.580 --> 42:34.760]  rigidity of the
[42:35.540 --> 42:37.320]  bits or whatever. The segments.
[42:37.560 --> 42:39.600]  They don't have to be rigid. I'm just thinking of like
[42:39.600 --> 42:41.860]  us in the morning trying to entertain people
[42:41.860 --> 42:43.060]  as they start their day.
[42:43.800 --> 42:45.120]  But we'd be grumpy
[42:45.640 --> 42:47.540]  probably. Somebody would be in a bad
[42:47.540 --> 42:49.580]  mood. I don't know. It just seems like
[42:49.580 --> 42:51.620]  it could be a thing. I'm not saying it should be a thing.
[42:51.940 --> 42:53.400]  I'm just envisioning it.
[42:53.520 --> 42:55.540]  You know what? Snicked, snicked. You guys
[42:55.540 --> 42:57.440]  both got fucked. You're dead.
[42:59.560 --> 43:01.160]  I think you just popped the claws out.
[43:01.240 --> 43:03.380]  Oh no. I did a lot more than
[43:03.380 --> 43:05.200]  pop the claws. I popped your heads off.
[43:13.300 --> 43:14.020]  Oh man.
[43:15.300 --> 43:17.300]  Well we're gonna get the reverse of that tonight
[43:17.300 --> 43:19.200]  because this is the latest we've recorded.
[43:19.380 --> 43:21.200]  Oh no. We recorded at 9pm months, didn't we?
[43:21.240 --> 43:23.320]  Yeah. I like that we did
[43:23.320 --> 43:25.360]  that for that, but we're not doing this for sloppy chips.
[43:25.600 --> 43:26.660]  We can push it back.
[43:27.000 --> 43:29.240]  We can push it back farther now that we're doing it remote.
[43:29.420 --> 43:31.500]  We can definitely push it back further. I don't mind that.
[43:31.620 --> 43:32.680]  I just didn't want like
[43:33.440 --> 43:35.320]  I didn't want to do something super late on like
[43:35.320 --> 43:37.320]  a Thursday and I knew that other people had
[43:37.320 --> 43:39.040]  stuff very early on Friday.
[43:39.580 --> 43:41.400]  It's up to you guys. I don't mind changing
[43:41.400 --> 43:43.060]  the time some. To what time?
[43:44.640 --> 43:45.300]  We can figure
[43:45.300 --> 43:46.880]  that out after. We don't need to do that now.
[43:48.220 --> 43:49.040]  I don't think
[43:49.040 --> 43:51.200]  there should be like a legal protection
[43:51.200 --> 43:53.120]  against you after biting a year old apple
[43:53.120 --> 43:55.200]  and huffing ice that you shouldn't be allowed to make
[43:55.200 --> 43:57.240]  any commitments for like at least 15
[43:57.240 --> 43:57.580]  minutes.
[43:58.700 --> 44:01.280]  I can't believe I survived my own double
[44:01.280 --> 44:03.040]  gag gauntlet. You sure did.
[44:03.320 --> 44:04.220]  With flying colors.
[44:05.060 --> 44:05.780]  It was pretty impressive.
[44:06.600 --> 44:08.820]  Did you buy all the crisps yet?
[44:09.240 --> 44:10.820]  He doesn't have the list, but it's so funny
[44:10.820 --> 44:13.100]  you mentioned that. Just about to say
[44:13.100 --> 44:14.040]  the exact same thing.
[44:14.300 --> 44:15.840]  We need to all submit his stuff.
[44:16.420 --> 44:18.640]  I have links, Eric, so you can buy.
[44:18.740 --> 44:21.300]  I have my chip selection. I assume we're all doing three or four?
[44:22.160 --> 44:23.000]  Yeah, that would be it.
[44:23.700 --> 44:25.040]  Yeah, okay. Well, I have my links.
[44:25.460 --> 44:26.860]  I was going to send them to you yesterday,
[44:27.020 --> 44:29.000]  but I thought, oh, I don't want to just randomly send
[44:29.000 --> 44:30.960]  this without, you know, I don't know when this will happen.
[44:31.280 --> 44:33.060]  I'd love to do that, so if you guys
[44:33.060 --> 44:35.120]  could come up with your chips, that'd be great
[44:35.120 --> 44:35.780]  and we could do it.
[44:38.040 --> 44:38.900]  Speaking of chips,
[44:39.480 --> 44:40.900]  this is actually something I put
[44:40.900 --> 44:43.180]  in my notes. I discovered
[44:43.180 --> 44:45.140]  something that I like
[44:45.640 --> 44:46.920]  very, very much,
[44:47.080 --> 44:49.040]  but I can only eat, like, three
[44:49.040 --> 44:51.000]  of before I've hit my limit. And it got me
[44:51.000 --> 44:51.560]  wondering,
[44:52.920 --> 44:55.100]  what is the thing that you like to eat
[44:55.100 --> 44:56.760]  the most that you can eat the least?
[44:57.600 --> 44:58.940]  Like, in this instance, for me,
[44:59.160 --> 45:00.960]  it's dill pickle potato chips.
[45:01.400 --> 45:03.000]  Like, they're fucking, the first one's amazing,
[45:03.200 --> 45:05.100]  the second one's even better, the third one's
[45:05.100 --> 45:06.860]  great, and by the fourth one, I'm like, put it back,
[45:06.900 --> 45:09.220]  I don't need it, I can't handle it. Like, I just hit, like, a limit
[45:09.520 --> 45:10.340]  immediately. But I love-
[45:10.340 --> 45:12.280]  In what way can't you handle it? Like, you're just done with them?
[45:12.680 --> 45:15.040]  Yeah, like, it's just, like, too much flavor, it's just, like, too much,
[45:15.060 --> 45:17.400]  it, like, turns in me after, like, a few,
[45:17.720 --> 45:19.100]  and it's like, oh, I have to put it back.
[45:19.160 --> 45:20.940]  I've had a bag I've been trying to work through for, like, a month,
[45:21.020 --> 45:23.340]  because I just, I can't eat more than three or four
[45:23.340 --> 45:24.940]  at a time. And it just goes from, like,
[45:24.960 --> 45:26.420]  amazing to, like,
[45:27.300 --> 45:28.960]  hard stop. Like, my body's just like,
[45:29.040 --> 45:30.500]  you've had four, that's too many.
[45:30.540 --> 45:32.800]  I mean, that's pancakes for me. Okay.
[45:33.240 --> 45:35.020]  Usually. Yeah, after, like, five bites
[45:35.020 --> 45:36.200]  of pancakes, I'm sick of them.
[45:37.000 --> 45:38.140]  That's crazy to me,
[45:38.220 --> 45:40.260]  because the pancakes for me is the food I could almost
[45:40.260 --> 45:42.160]  endlessly eat. Like, my
[45:42.160 --> 45:44.000]  ceiling is way higher on pancakes.
[45:44.200 --> 45:45.420]  Could you eat to the ceiling?
[45:46.280 --> 45:47.380]  What size pancakes?
[45:47.860 --> 45:50.060]  We talking? No. I'm gonna say no.
[45:50.140 --> 45:52.140]  I'm done with food stuff. I've got...
[45:52.140 --> 45:54.060]  I had a moment where I was like,
[45:54.080 --> 45:55.960]  you know what, I think I could probably do that, and then
[45:55.960 --> 45:58.160]  the flashes of all the food trauma
[45:58.160 --> 46:00.260]  of this show, of trying to
[46:00.260 --> 46:02.160]  eat to the ceiling. How tall are your
[46:02.160 --> 46:02.600]  ceilings?
[46:04.640 --> 46:05.520]  How tall are you?
[46:05.660 --> 46:06.240]  Like, six feet?
[46:06.720 --> 46:08.200]  Who are you talking to? Me? Yeah.
[46:08.520 --> 46:10.340]  I'm like five foot ten. If we
[46:10.340 --> 46:12.540]  built you out of pancakes, how much
[46:13.220 --> 46:14.060]  would you eat?
[46:14.340 --> 46:16.340]  From the head down? Could you eat to the shoulders?
[46:16.480 --> 46:17.620]  Just in height?
[46:18.420 --> 46:20.600]  What's the average? Are we talking flapjacks?
[46:20.820 --> 46:22.560]  There's a wide range of pancakes.
[46:23.380 --> 46:23.820]  Flapjacks?
[46:24.420 --> 46:26.620]  Sand dollar pancakes? Those are tiny ones.
[46:26.800 --> 46:28.280]  Like, I'm saying there's a very instant height.
[46:28.880 --> 46:29.760]  Smaller pancakes.
[46:29.760 --> 46:31.240]  A smaller pancake.
[46:31.580 --> 46:32.920]  But not like giant flapjacks.
[46:33.480 --> 46:35.640]  You know what, let's say this. If I
[46:35.640 --> 46:37.560]  fell into a pit of
[46:37.560 --> 46:39.500]  pancake sand, I could probably
[46:39.500 --> 46:41.700]  eat my way out from the waist down.
[46:43.340 --> 46:43.780]  Anything
[46:43.780 --> 46:46.200]  past that would be a problem.
[46:46.400 --> 46:47.840]  I would succumb to the pancakes. You could eat to the waist?
[46:48.540 --> 46:49.460]  Yeah, so like if I'm
[46:49.460 --> 46:51.640]  imagining this, my waist, the waist,
[46:51.740 --> 46:52.860]  I'd say the waist is the area.
[46:53.620 --> 46:55.620]  You know, like in a
[46:55.620 --> 46:57.840]  movie, an old movie, you don't really see quicksand
[46:57.840 --> 46:59.660]  anymore. They got rid of quicksand.
[47:00.500 --> 47:02.300]  When's the last time you saw quicksand?
[47:02.560 --> 47:03.960]  Gavin set up such
[47:03.960 --> 47:05.180]  an easy scenario.
[47:05.780 --> 47:07.380]  It is the same height as you.
[47:07.920 --> 47:09.920]  And you went, if I was in
[47:09.920 --> 47:11.680]  pancake quicksand,
[47:11.800 --> 47:13.620]  what are you talking about?
[47:13.620 --> 47:15.140]  So you say you're eating your legs?
[47:15.580 --> 47:17.700]  No, I'm not eating my legs. I'm saying that if I
[47:17.700 --> 47:20.320]  stepped in, if there was like a
[47:20.320 --> 47:21.940]  pancake was a natural
[47:21.940 --> 47:23.800]  thing you found in the wild, and I
[47:23.800 --> 47:25.820]  stepped into the quicksand equivalent
[47:25.820 --> 47:27.500]  where I'm just slowly
[47:27.500 --> 47:29.820]  sinking into the cake.
[47:29.960 --> 47:31.680]  If I got cakes all around me and they're
[47:31.680 --> 47:32.620]  slowly rising.
[47:33.160 --> 47:35.780]  If I started eating when it was
[47:35.780 --> 47:37.020]  at waist level,
[47:37.660 --> 47:39.640]  I would be okay. Because I have really
[47:39.640 --> 47:41.820]  short legs, as we've established. I'm almost all
[47:41.820 --> 47:43.460]  back. I'm 90% back.
[47:43.580 --> 47:44.740]  You're eating legs worth?
[47:45.360 --> 47:47.540]  I'm eating legs worth, but honestly, it would be
[47:47.540 --> 47:49.420]  fascinating to know the size
[47:49.420 --> 47:51.740]  difference of the two. Like I bet
[47:51.740 --> 47:53.740]  you my legs worth is probably
[47:53.740 --> 47:56.000]  20% and my back
[47:56.000 --> 47:57.820]  is 80%. Are we doing this by
[47:57.820 --> 47:59.800]  weight or by mass? I'm doing
[47:59.800 --> 48:01.200]  by height. By length, right?
[48:01.480 --> 48:02.900]  By length. Yeah.
[48:03.860 --> 48:05.740]  By length of thing. I have very
[48:05.740 --> 48:07.880]  short legs. Like you could eat your legs worth
[48:07.880 --> 48:09.640]  but maybe not Nick's legs worth.
[48:10.180 --> 48:11.740]  Absolutely. Yeah, I don't
[48:11.740 --> 48:13.840]  think anyone here can eat my back
[48:13.840 --> 48:15.840]  length of pancakes. It's a lot of pancakes.
[48:17.840 --> 48:19.320]  It's a huge amount.
[48:19.720 --> 48:21.960]  Why do I want to...
[48:21.960 --> 48:23.680]  Where do we cut off for the back?
[48:23.760 --> 48:25.920]  Where does the back stop? Is it at the
[48:25.920 --> 48:28.040]  shoulder blades? Yeah, I think so.
[48:28.140 --> 48:29.220]  Over the top of the shoulders.
[48:29.840 --> 48:32.100]  Top of the shoulders? Where the neck
[48:32.100 --> 48:33.680]  begins. Yeah, where the neck begins.
[48:33.920 --> 48:35.940]  It's neck to the elastic
[48:35.940 --> 48:36.700]  of your boxes.
[48:37.760 --> 48:39.800]  Because the spine goes further than you
[48:39.800 --> 48:40.400]  would anticipate.
[48:41.520 --> 48:44.060]  From what I've seen. Are you guys anticipating
[48:44.060 --> 48:45.440]  spine length or
[48:45.860 --> 48:46.840]  where are you on that?
[48:48.320 --> 48:49.640]  Because isn't the back
[48:49.640 --> 48:51.820]  the spine? The entirety of the spine
[48:51.820 --> 48:53.740]  is the back. Or is there a difference? Is there
[48:53.740 --> 48:55.900]  a point where the back exists but the spine
[48:55.900 --> 48:56.440]  doesn't begin?
[48:57.500 --> 48:59.000]  The spine ends
[48:59.480 --> 49:01.040]  in the base of your skull.
[49:01.840 --> 49:03.800]  It's like in your head. And it goes all the way
[49:03.800 --> 49:05.700]  down the back, right? Like if you grab
[49:05.700 --> 49:07.880]  someone's spine, that's
[49:07.880 --> 49:08.520]  their back.
[49:09.240 --> 49:11.800]  Oh wait, the tailbone, does that connect
[49:11.800 --> 49:13.720]  to the spine? It's the end of the spine, I think.
[49:13.940 --> 49:15.560]  But then your ribs
[49:15.560 --> 49:16.460]  are also your back.
[49:17.440 --> 49:17.820]  Really?
[49:17.820 --> 49:18.680]  They're not the same.
[49:19.820 --> 49:22.280]  I guess I can see.
[49:23.200 --> 49:24.380]  Like what's your lap?
[49:25.040 --> 49:26.720]  Could you eat your lap's worth of pancakes?
[49:27.460 --> 49:28.240]  I don't think so.
[49:28.460 --> 49:30.040]  That seems like a lot.
[49:30.120 --> 49:31.160]  What is a lap?
[49:32.520 --> 49:34.240]  When Scorpion pulls your spine out,
[49:34.320 --> 49:36.240]  does it have the ribs on it too or is it just the spine?
[49:36.420 --> 49:37.500]  I think it's just the spine.
[49:38.100 --> 49:39.540]  I'm thinking about predator
[49:39.540 --> 49:42.220]  is in my head. That's where I've seen the most
[49:42.220 --> 49:43.840]  spines, I feel like, in predator movies.
[49:43.840 --> 49:45.520]  I think it goes from the beltline to
[49:45.520 --> 49:46.960]  the top of your shoulders.
[49:49.720 --> 49:52.040]  Next time we record, I'll let you know how far that is.
[49:52.300 --> 49:53.720]  We could measure, we could figure out roughly
[49:53.720 --> 49:55.660]  how many pancakes it would be to eat my back's worth.
[49:55.780 --> 49:57.260]  What unit of measurement do they use
[49:57.260 --> 49:59.020]  in Canada?
[49:59.760 --> 50:00.460]  Like meters.
[50:01.980 --> 50:03.620]  So it's useless to Eric and I.
[50:03.940 --> 50:05.200]  Yeah, I could convert though.
[50:05.300 --> 50:06.500]  I'm used to it.
[50:07.940 --> 50:09.140]  I think that'll work.
[50:09.460 --> 50:10.820]  How many pancakes do you think,
[50:11.320 --> 50:12.280]  just as a guess,
[50:12.380 --> 50:14.280]  like a jelly bean and a jar thing,
[50:14.640 --> 50:16.560]  how many pancakes can make my back?
[50:16.780 --> 50:18.500]  We're just going height, we're not going width.
[50:18.720 --> 50:19.560]  We're just going height.
[50:21.340 --> 50:22.220]  28. No.
[50:23.660 --> 50:24.100]  28?
[50:24.500 --> 50:26.940]  That is a tiny... I think you're bad at this game.
[50:27.300 --> 50:27.680]  I think
[50:29.340 --> 50:30.480]  your back is
[50:30.480 --> 50:31.500]  56 pancakes.
[50:33.420 --> 50:34.600]  That's a little bit closer.
[50:35.220 --> 50:36.500]  For me, Gavin, it was like
[50:36.500 --> 50:38.620]  you looked at the jar jelly beans and said 12.
[50:38.620 --> 50:39.400]  Like that's...
[50:41.200 --> 50:42.040]  That's a good point.
[50:42.180 --> 50:44.440]  That's like a quarter of a meter.
[50:44.540 --> 50:46.160]  Yeah, it's gotta be. It's gotta be like
[50:46.160 --> 50:46.820]  80.
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.740]  That's probably even closer. I bet you it's at least
[50:50.740 --> 50:52.520]  in the 70s.
[50:53.200 --> 50:54.680]  But we have to come up with a standardized
[50:54.680 --> 50:56.420]  height for pancakes, I guess.
[50:56.720 --> 50:58.120]  It becomes the problem. Centimeter.
[50:59.080 --> 51:00.260]  So are you saying
[51:00.260 --> 51:02.500]  you have the longest back in
[51:02.500 --> 51:04.960]  F*** Face? Undeniably.
[51:04.960 --> 51:06.660]  I have the longest back in F*** Face.
[51:06.660 --> 51:08.840]  If somebody... I would be genuinely disappointed
[51:08.840 --> 51:10.320]  if anyone here... But Geoff's taller. He's
[51:10.320 --> 51:11.540]  surely got a longer back.
[51:12.420 --> 51:14.100]  I'm a lot of torso, too.
[51:14.240 --> 51:16.800]  For my height, I think my legs are a little short.
[51:17.560 --> 51:17.900]  Okay.
[51:18.540 --> 51:19.840]  Are we gonna have a back-off?
[51:20.160 --> 51:21.620]  No, I'm not trying to. I'm just curious.
[51:22.080 --> 51:23.540]  I think we should all back off.
[51:25.260 --> 51:26.600]  I like the idea of a back-off.
[51:26.880 --> 51:28.580]  Can everybody measure your back before the next episode?
[51:28.580 --> 51:30.800]  Yeah, absolutely. I can measure my back now.
[51:31.300 --> 51:32.540]  Does that need to be done separately?
[51:32.540 --> 51:34.580]  How are you gonna measure your back? It's behind you.
[51:34.580 --> 51:35.680]  You need somebody to help you.
[51:36.900 --> 51:38.200]  What are you talking about?
[51:39.220 --> 51:40.420]  I can hold the tape measure
[51:40.420 --> 51:42.560]  to my back, and I can
[51:42.560 --> 51:43.640]  grab the other end of it.
[51:44.360 --> 51:45.880]  I don't know where a tape measure is.
[51:45.920 --> 51:48.640]  I'm not trusting that measurement. I need Meg
[51:48.640 --> 51:50.240]  to do it. Are you serious?
[51:51.460 --> 51:52.580]  I'm not doing it myself.
[51:52.720 --> 51:53.620]  I'm gonna have Emily do it.
[51:54.160 --> 51:55.380]  I wanna get a precise measurement.
[51:55.520 --> 51:56.780]  I definitely need assistance for this.
[51:58.100 --> 51:59.740]  How are you gonna measure it?
[51:59.960 --> 52:00.980]  It's behind you.
[52:01.620 --> 52:03.220]  Well, you can't trust that measurement.
[52:03.240 --> 52:05.100]  They don't measure themselves at the combine, Gavin.
[52:05.360 --> 52:06.660]  They could if that was an efficient,
[52:06.840 --> 52:09.300]  if that was an appropriate way to measure distance or length.
[52:09.860 --> 52:10.940]  They do it that way. They don't.
[52:11.140 --> 52:12.820]  Somebody helps. 25 inches.
[52:13.820 --> 52:15.240]  That's how long your back is?
[52:15.680 --> 52:16.580]  Yep, just measure my back.
[52:16.720 --> 52:17.820]  Alright, I'm gonna measure my back.
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.040]  Not that hard. Super easy to do.
[52:21.420 --> 52:22.440]  Incredibly easy to do.
[52:22.460 --> 52:24.560]  The integrity of these numbers are not as
[52:25.560 --> 52:27.320]  accurate. These are not official numbers.
[52:28.040 --> 52:28.900]  These are, yeah.
[52:28.900 --> 52:30.760]  These have to be independently verified.
[52:31.200 --> 52:31.580]  Absolutely.
[52:31.900 --> 52:33.940]  I'm not gonna make my wife measure my back.
[52:34.400 --> 52:36.220]  You're not gonna make her. You're gonna ask her
[52:36.220 --> 52:38.300]  and she's gonna be happy to do it because she loves you
[52:38.300 --> 52:39.420]  and likes to spend time with you.
[52:40.000 --> 52:41.760]  You think that's how we spend time?
[52:42.300 --> 52:43.900]  No. Have you ever done it before?
[52:44.140 --> 52:46.380]  You might discover that it's something that you guys
[52:46.380 --> 52:47.360]  love to do together.
[52:48.180 --> 52:48.640]  It's true.
[52:50.840 --> 52:52.600]  Are you gonna trust Gavin
[52:52.600 --> 52:54.440]  with the number that he comes back with?
[52:54.460 --> 52:55.160]  No. 21.
[52:55.160 --> 52:56.840]  What was yours, Eric?
[52:57.380 --> 52:59.240]  Like, really?
[52:59.360 --> 52:59.960]  Are you going to?
[53:02.280 --> 53:03.840]  Mine was 25.
[53:04.300 --> 53:05.320]  Wait, your back is
[53:05.320 --> 53:06.560]  25 and mine is 21?
[53:08.380 --> 53:09.220]  They're already
[53:09.220 --> 53:11.120]  shaky about the numbers, Geoff.
[53:11.660 --> 53:13.380]  Are you sure
[53:13.380 --> 53:14.280]  yours is 24?
[53:15.720 --> 53:17.260]  I'm sure it's 25.
[53:17.700 --> 53:19.180]  Goddammit, I'll be back.
[53:19.480 --> 53:19.940]  Hold on.
[53:21.000 --> 53:21.920]  I'm gonna wait.
[53:21.920 --> 53:23.240]  So wait, I'm touching it to, like,
[53:23.340 --> 53:26.000]  the small of my back, like, my boxers
[53:26.000 --> 53:26.460]  area.
[53:27.160 --> 53:29.760]  From the elastic to the top of the shoulders, which would be
[53:29.760 --> 53:31.960]  the bottom of your neck, and that would be it.
[53:32.240 --> 53:33.140]  22 that time.
[53:33.580 --> 53:34.080]  Oh, interesting.
[53:36.300 --> 53:37.960]  I have a lot of confidence in my number.
[53:38.040 --> 53:39.660]  I don't have a lot of confidence in Gavin's. That was weird.
[53:40.040 --> 53:41.900]  He just got an inch taller? Come on.
[53:42.060 --> 53:43.800]  Well, I did it sitting down the second time.
[53:43.860 --> 53:44.740]  Were you sat down when you measured?
[53:45.120 --> 53:46.520]  No, I'm standing. I have a standing desk.
[53:47.620 --> 53:49.360]  There's gonna be an angle. I don't trust it.
[53:49.840 --> 53:50.580]  I'm gonna get
[53:51.700 --> 53:52.420]  accurate measurements.
[53:54.700 --> 53:55.440]  Are you guys gonna
[53:55.440 --> 53:57.220]  trust Geoff with whatever he comes back with?
[53:57.480 --> 53:59.200]  Should I not know Geoff's number?
[53:59.360 --> 54:01.620]  Because I don't want to seem like I'm trying to boost my own.
[54:02.080 --> 54:03.460]  Trying to get a package. Oh, I definitely want to know
[54:03.460 --> 54:03.920]  Geoff's number.
[54:05.320 --> 54:07.020]  Should I not know it, though? I agree.
[54:07.020 --> 54:08.400]  I think you can know it.
[54:09.180 --> 54:11.120]  I think I'm gonna trust you with this, Andrew.
[54:11.860 --> 54:12.760]  I appreciate that.
[54:12.840 --> 54:14.400]  I think I'm choosing to trust you.
[54:14.760 --> 54:16.460]  After the whole lotto ball thing?
[54:16.460 --> 54:18.020]  I feel like it's been...
[54:18.020 --> 54:19.460]  I've been against the wall.
[54:20.580 --> 54:21.960]  But I didn't lie about that.
[54:22.120 --> 54:23.800]  I don't trust Eric's numbers at all.
[54:23.920 --> 54:25.820]  I just measured 22 inches. There's no way.
[54:26.840 --> 54:28.280]  Nick said, do you go to
[54:28.280 --> 54:29.680]  shoulders or to your head?
[54:29.960 --> 54:32.060]  Why would you also measure your neck?
[54:32.560 --> 54:33.740]  Your neck is not your back.
[54:35.140 --> 54:36.480]  I ended it like my main
[54:37.040 --> 54:38.320]  spine nodule at the top
[54:38.320 --> 54:40.040]  of my shoulders. Yeah, same.
[54:41.600 --> 54:42.040]  Okay.
[54:42.580 --> 54:44.100]  So as it stands right now, Eric has
[54:44.100 --> 54:46.160]  the longest back. I don't buy it.
[54:46.220 --> 54:46.940]  Eric's full of shit.
[54:48.280 --> 54:49.500]  There's no way.
[54:50.300 --> 54:52.300]  I will say, looking at the Brahma's
[54:52.300 --> 54:54.200]  photos, you do not strike me as the guy
[54:54.200 --> 54:56.220]  with the longest back. I agree with you,
[54:56.280 --> 54:57.040]  yet here we are.
[54:57.720 --> 54:59.520]  No, we're not here we are. You measured wrong.
[54:59.820 --> 55:01.600]  I would say that... Here's what we do.
[55:02.860 --> 55:04.180]  Since Eric doesn't want to
[55:04.180 --> 55:05.180]  get his wife involved,
[55:05.920 --> 55:08.060]  we're measuring at the next office
[55:08.060 --> 55:08.380]  day.
[55:09.900 --> 55:11.940]  Look at the Brahma's photo, them standing
[55:11.940 --> 55:13.900]  in front of the logo. You guys seem
[55:13.900 --> 55:15.980]  like you have essentially identical length
[55:15.980 --> 55:17.840]  and legs, but Geoff
[55:17.840 --> 55:19.960]  seems like he's got a significantly larger
[55:19.960 --> 55:21.580]  back than you. And yet,
[55:22.040 --> 55:23.900]  and yet, here we are. With an
[55:23.900 --> 55:25.060]  incorrect measurement, I agree.
[55:27.060 --> 55:28.000]  Nick hasn't measured.
[55:29.700 --> 55:31.600]  Yeah, I wouldn't trust Eric to measure anything.
[55:32.120 --> 55:32.500]  Anything?
[55:35.900 --> 55:37.740]  I couldn't measure anything?
[55:37.920 --> 55:39.640]  Oh boy. You're way off.
[55:39.840 --> 55:41.760]  You're off by like 10%.
[55:42.640 --> 55:43.440]  No, I'm right.
[55:44.680 --> 55:45.680]  We'll find out
[55:45.680 --> 55:47.800]  next office day. That's good. We need
[55:47.800 --> 55:48.860]  to wrap this episode up anyway.
[55:49.860 --> 55:51.820]  And then are we doing Andrew's back next time as
[55:51.820 --> 55:53.980]  well? I will have numbers
[55:53.980 --> 55:55.420]  next time we record, for sure.
[55:55.540 --> 55:58.100]  I appreciate that, Andrew. I may need to get
[55:58.100 --> 55:59.920]  a specialty measurer
[55:59.920 --> 56:01.700]  tape. Wow, I forgot
[56:01.700 --> 56:03.300]  the word. I was going to say measurer,
[56:03.660 --> 56:04.800]  and that seemed dumb.
[56:05.780 --> 56:07.280]  We're going to need... It's going to be long.
[56:07.560 --> 56:09.720]  I'm going to
[56:09.720 --> 56:11.740]  back all of you, and I'm not
[56:11.740 --> 56:13.780]  worried about it. It's a definite
[56:13.780 --> 56:14.440]  going to happen.
[56:15.320 --> 56:17.120]  I can't wait to find out.
[56:20.360 --> 56:21.780]  I did not expect
[56:21.780 --> 56:24.000]  we'd end up in a back off, but I like it.
[56:24.380 --> 56:25.600]  Where did this start?
[56:25.720 --> 56:26.620]  Why did we get to the back off?
[56:27.220 --> 56:29.800]  You were asking me about how many pancakes
[56:29.800 --> 56:31.580]  we need. Eating our back
[56:31.580 --> 56:33.660]  in pancakes. Yeah, yeah. This is what
[56:33.660 --> 56:35.760]  happens when you've been in the lab. Things go this
[56:35.760 --> 56:36.020]  way.
[56:37.940 --> 56:38.400]  Listen,
[56:38.660 --> 56:39.680]  this is a very organized place.
[56:39.960 --> 56:42.100]  I'm going to take it on faith that Andrew probably
[56:42.100 --> 56:44.000]  does in fact have the longest back, but
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  I'll be damned if the longest back is
[56:46.000 --> 56:47.960]  Eric. There's no way. Oh, I don't think I have the
[56:47.960 --> 56:49.980]  longest back. I just... 25. Easy.
[56:51.820 --> 56:52.640]  You're an idiot.
[56:53.260 --> 56:53.580]  Ludicrous.
[56:54.640 --> 56:55.100]  Ludicrous.
[56:58.040 --> 56:58.960]  Absolutely ludicrous.
[56:59.580 --> 57:00.040]  Ludicrous.
[57:01.780 --> 57:02.800]  He's all back.
[57:03.280 --> 57:04.260]  I'm going to bet
[57:04.260 --> 57:05.820]  he never went and got a tape measure
[57:05.820 --> 57:08.120]  and he just googled average
[57:08.120 --> 57:08.760]  back length.
[57:11.480 --> 57:12.440]  You think Eric doesn't
[57:12.440 --> 57:13.520]  have an average back length?
[57:13.740 --> 57:15.920]  He looked in the mirror and eyeballed it.
[57:16.060 --> 57:17.460]  You think I eyeballed it?
[57:17.860 --> 57:20.200]  I don't think you got four more
[57:20.200 --> 57:21.340]  inches than your back.
[57:23.100 --> 57:24.440]  I don't think you're that bad at...
[57:24.440 --> 57:25.940]  Oh, hang on. Jack's in the chat.
[57:26.300 --> 57:26.560]  Okay.
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.480]  Looks like the average is about 19.7.
[57:31.020 --> 57:32.400]  Wow, I'm way longer
[57:32.400 --> 57:33.500]  than the average. That's awesome.
[57:36.960 --> 57:37.880]  There's no way.
[57:39.260 --> 57:40.320]  It's in the chat
[57:40.320 --> 57:40.760]  already.
[57:42.120 --> 57:44.260]  Okay, those are the lines. I appreciate that. That's a very
[57:45.440 --> 57:45.800]  clear...
[57:46.180 --> 57:48.600]  I almost feel like that's a little high
[57:48.600 --> 57:50.320]  on the lower end. It seems like it could be a little
[57:50.320 --> 57:52.320]  high on the lower end. I probably would pick lower.
[57:52.400 --> 57:54.320]  I probably would go a little lower. I'd go a little bit
[57:54.320 --> 57:56.400]  lower than that. Yeah. That's just what
[57:56.400 --> 57:58.160]  I found on the internet for measuring your back.
[57:58.760 --> 57:59.440]  That's fair.
[57:59.440 --> 58:01.560]  I just... I don't...
[58:01.560 --> 58:03.500]  And maybe we got like a Lord of the Rings
[58:03.500 --> 58:05.240]  thing going on here. Like maybe
[58:05.840 --> 58:07.500]  somebody's a little closer than the other
[58:07.500 --> 58:09.500]  but you can't... you look at that photo and
[58:09.500 --> 58:11.560]  you say that Eric has a larger
[58:11.560 --> 58:13.400]  back than Geoff? There's no way.
[58:14.900 --> 58:15.400]  What unit
[58:15.400 --> 58:17.040]  is your measurer, Eric?
[58:17.340 --> 58:17.800]  Centimeters.
[58:19.520 --> 58:21.460]  It's fucking inches. Of course it's inches.
[58:21.600 --> 58:22.120]  What kind of question is that?
[58:25.740 --> 58:27.540]  That broke Gavin once again.
[58:27.540 --> 58:28.660]  It certainly did.
[58:28.920 --> 58:30.320]  It wasn't even about a dick this time.
[58:33.300 --> 58:35.480]  Alright, we need to wrap up.
[58:35.800 --> 58:36.740]  Let's end this thing.
[58:36.960 --> 58:39.020]  Is there anything we need to plug or anything before we go?
[58:39.120 --> 58:41.300]  Come to RTX July 7th through 9th.
[58:42.080 --> 58:43.420]  RTXAustin.com. Get your tickets
[58:43.420 --> 58:45.760]  and see the f*** face museum.
[58:46.240 --> 58:47.560]  Oh hey, speaking of which
[58:47.560 --> 58:49.600]  Andrew, I know you don't want to send your
[58:50.740 --> 58:51.540]  icing down
[58:51.540 --> 58:52.880]  but do you have any like
[58:53.440 --> 58:55.740]  half-made baskets or anything you could send our way for the museum?
[58:56.200 --> 58:58.020]  Not that I think would make it.
[59:00.840 --> 59:01.960]  I still have
[59:01.960 --> 59:03.620]  the basket but it would
[59:03.620 --> 59:05.000]  it will not last.
[59:05.260 --> 59:07.500]  I don't think I could walk out the house with the basket.
[59:07.720 --> 59:09.600]  Do you still have the sushi container
[59:09.600 --> 59:11.460]  by any chance? I do not.
[59:11.660 --> 59:13.840]  It didn't occur to me to save the sushi
[59:13.840 --> 59:15.860]  container. Do you have the candle? Do you have the fire
[59:15.860 --> 59:17.760]  extinguisher bag? 30
[59:17.760 --> 59:19.400]  inch back from Jack apparently.
[59:19.640 --> 59:21.600]  You can't listen to Jack. Jack isn't involved in this.
[59:21.680 --> 59:23.700]  We just have to get through this. We have to end
[59:23.700 --> 59:25.640]  this thing. We can't involve Jack in this.
[59:26.020 --> 59:27.740]  What kind of
[59:28.320 --> 59:29.860]  world is he living in?
[59:30.000 --> 59:31.660]  Okay, Geoff, can you plug the socials
[59:31.660 --> 59:33.760]  and we can go? Hey, this is
[59:33.760 --> 59:35.740]  Geoff plugging the socials and then we can go.
[59:36.080 --> 59:37.780]  If you like f*** face, check us
[59:37.780 --> 59:39.540]  out on social medias. We got them.
[59:39.780 --> 59:40.820]  We'll see you next time.
[59:42.560 --> 59:43.820]  Hey guys, Major League
[59:43.820 --> 59:45.680]  Fan Jack here with a look at next week's
[59:45.680 --> 59:47.600]  episode of f*** face. Nick
[59:47.600 --> 59:49.580]  got away with it. Old people look
[59:49.580 --> 59:51.720]  better now. Gavin has another life
[59:51.720 --> 59:53.540]  pack. Geoff heads to Savannah.
[59:54.020 --> 59:55.800]  Gavin gets a message. And once
[59:55.800 --> 59:57.540]  again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[59:58.080 --> 59:59.880]  All that and more on next week's episode
[59:59.880 --> 01:00:00.820]  of f*** face.
