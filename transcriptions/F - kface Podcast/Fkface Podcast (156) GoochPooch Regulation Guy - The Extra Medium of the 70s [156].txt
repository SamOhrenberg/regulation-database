[00:10.300 --> 00:15.520]  Gavin will be here in 20 seconds, so if there's anything derogatory you want to say about him.
[00:15.760 --> 00:16.220]  Now's the time.
[00:16.800 --> 00:17.020]  Woah!
[00:19.880 --> 00:21.340]  20 seconds isn't enough time.
[00:23.200 --> 00:26.540]  He just made the noise. That was so funny.
[00:27.860 --> 00:28.440]  He's early.
[00:28.440 --> 00:49.960]  So, last time we talked about backlinks, COVID, GeoWizard, Sloppy Joe's Trivia, Italian Food, Cordura Digital, Jason Bourne, Season Ticket Resale, Gavin's Slime, which I'd love an update on if possible, and Rock Not Rock Reactions.
[00:50.480 --> 00:53.340]  There's more, but that's the gist of it. This is 156. Whenever you're ready.
[00:53.340 --> 01:02.960]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast. My name is Geoff Ramsey, with me as always, Andrew Pantin and Gavin Free, or Agnag as we like to be called.
[01:04.280 --> 01:11.400]  I gotta be honest with you, it kind of throws me when Eric says the episode number because then it feels dumb for me to say it again. Episode 156.
[01:11.600 --> 01:14.940]  Well, what Eric is saying is not in the show, I assume.
[01:15.340 --> 01:16.280]  Yeah, it's just for you.
[01:16.520 --> 01:17.340]  It's just us.
[01:17.700 --> 01:21.080]  Oh, but I thought it was lovely. I think it'd be a nice little button for the show, for the audience.
[01:21.760 --> 01:27.520]  I'll be honest, I'm surprised it wasn't introduced as T-Bone, Ramscoop, and Frosty.
[01:27.940 --> 01:43.140]  Oh, right, a great point. I haven't, I usually, I've been making a point lately of listening to the previous episode before we record, and I just got behind, and I actually just listened to this week's episode, so I was an episode behind, so I forgot about Ramscoop.
[01:43.160 --> 01:45.100]  What is it, T-Bone, Ramscoop, and what?
[01:45.100 --> 01:51.160]  You forgot Frosty? Of all the names, you dropped Frosty over Ramscoop?
[01:53.240 --> 01:56.080]  Well, no, because Ramscoop is such a ridiculous name.
[01:56.400 --> 01:57.080]  What do you mean?
[01:57.860 --> 02:01.740]  Yeah, that's fair. I deleted Ramscoop, but...
[02:01.740 --> 02:10.060]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the F***ing Face Podcast. My name is T-Bone, and with me as always, Ramscoop and Frosty.
[02:10.520 --> 02:10.840]  Oh, thank you.
[02:10.840 --> 02:11.280]  How's it going?
[02:12.400 --> 02:14.100]  I'm staying Frosty, Geoff.
[02:14.100 --> 02:15.880]  I'm glad to hear it.
[02:15.880 --> 02:18.940]  Did we ever hear Nick and Eric's nicknames that they want?
[02:19.560 --> 02:19.840]  No.
[02:21.380 --> 02:27.820]  I don't know that I'm really like a nickname guy. I guess if anything, I want to be Big Dog, but that's pretty much it.
[02:29.320 --> 02:30.800]  What did that mean?
[02:34.580 --> 02:40.200]  I've always imagined Eric as more of a Gooch.
[02:41.860 --> 02:43.140]  Like, hey, what's up, Gooch?
[02:43.140 --> 02:48.860]  That's not what we're doing here. We're not doing other people's nicknames. That's not what this exercise has been.
[02:48.900 --> 02:49.700]  Hey, it's the Gooch.
[02:50.060 --> 02:53.380]  He picked Ramscoop. I'm picking my own name.
[02:53.840 --> 02:57.900]  To be fair, though, as soon as Geoff said Gooch, it fits so well.
[02:57.980 --> 02:58.200]  Absolutely not.
[02:58.200 --> 02:58.340]  It does.
[02:59.140 --> 02:59.660]  Nope.
[03:00.180 --> 03:04.040]  It doesn't matter. All of this is getting cut out anyway, so it doesn't matter.
[03:05.140 --> 03:06.860]  I reckon Gooch or Gooch Boy.
[03:07.580 --> 03:10.600]  I don't like Gooch Boy. The Gooch no feels.
[03:10.900 --> 03:11.040]  Nope.
[03:11.040 --> 03:11.600]  Nah.
[03:11.840 --> 03:12.900]  That's what he says.
[03:13.460 --> 03:15.940]  I mean, that's not what this exercise is. Not that.
[03:16.200 --> 03:18.540]  What about a mixture of both? Gooch Dog?
[03:19.160 --> 03:20.040]  Gooch Dog.
[03:20.180 --> 03:22.060]  Big Gooch. What about Big Gooch?
[03:22.440 --> 03:27.000]  Hey, if I had to pick one, I'd pick Gooch Dog, but that's just me.
[03:27.700 --> 03:31.980]  What if you switch Dog to Pooch and then we got something?
[03:33.580 --> 03:35.480]  You think Gooch Pooch?
[03:35.700 --> 03:37.540]  I think it's amazing.
[03:38.300 --> 03:40.000]  Gooch Pooch or Pooch Gooch?
[03:41.040 --> 03:42.880]  It's Gooch Pooch, I think.
[03:43.480 --> 03:51.940]  I mean, I'm not really... again, to be perfectly clear, the exercise was pick your own nickname, and now I have not.
[03:52.280 --> 03:57.820]  No, but in defense to them, they met you halfway. You want a big dog, you end up with Gooch Pooch. I feel like that's a good middle.
[03:57.940 --> 04:00.380]  Andrew, how is that in defense of anything?
[04:00.700 --> 04:03.540]  Well, I'm just stating you wanted one thing, they wanted something.
[04:03.540 --> 04:08.020]  As a rules guy, you should strictly be in defense of me in this situation.
[04:08.020 --> 04:12.840]  Well, as somebody who is labeled as piss boy for a lot of this show, I feel like you don't get a lot of rights when it comes to your nickname.
[04:12.840 --> 04:14.860]  So you would be on my side?
[04:14.920 --> 04:21.220]  No, I'm not. I'm against it because I had no rights. Why do you get rights? Why do you have any nickname rights? They met you halfway, you should be happy.
[04:21.760 --> 04:25.120]  You should be happy they met you halfway. Those are rules I can get behind.
[04:25.500 --> 04:27.280]  I will concede to Gooch Pooch.
[04:27.600 --> 04:31.400]  This is the first part of F*** Face that just feels like straight up bullying.
[04:31.900 --> 04:36.020]  Yes, absolutely. Yes, because again, this is not the exercise.
[04:36.020 --> 04:41.740]  Look, no, nobody's bullying anybody. Eric doesn't have to keep the name. We all get to pick our own names.
[04:41.860 --> 04:50.980]  Yeah, that's what's going to happen. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what the f*** I'm about to deal with on social media for the next year.
[04:51.180 --> 04:51.440]  No. No.
[04:51.660 --> 04:58.880]  Yeah, here's what's going to happen. Everyone's going to use the nickname I picked and definitely not Gooch Pooch.
[04:59.360 --> 05:05.940]  Audience, audience, if you're going to refer to Eric as anything other than Eric, please use his preferred nomenclature, which is Big Dog.
[05:05.940 --> 05:10.860]  Yeah, that'll work. Yeah, please. Yeah, this is me as a personal plea to you.
[05:11.140 --> 05:14.740]  Please only refer to him as Eric, Spice Rat or Big Dog.
[05:16.380 --> 05:18.480]  The name of this episode is Gooch Pooch.
[05:19.320 --> 05:24.880]  Do you have any, like, visuals when you think Gooch Pooch? Is there anything that comes to mind of like what a representation would be?
[05:25.180 --> 05:30.220]  Yeah, I was going to say, I'm literally about to, yeah, Poochy, I was putting in the chat. That's mine.
[05:30.340 --> 05:33.420]  I immediately, it just feels so natural. It feels like Eric. Feels like you.
[05:34.040 --> 05:41.260]  What about, what about Nick? Nick, do you have something? Because I saw the audience suggested something for you that I thought was pretty cool.
[05:41.380 --> 05:46.820]  I'm curious to hear that, but I've always kind of, I've never done this one before, but Schwartzy, I think that's kind of cool.
[05:46.880 --> 05:56.760]  It's like the guy behind the wheel kind of thing. Or maybe like a play on, you know, since I'm a big fan of sauces, like Sauce Boss, like saucy or the boss.
[05:56.760 --> 06:08.000]  Although that's taken, isn't it? I've just, I've just broken the news to Face Jam that this show has been using the sauce monkey and Nick laughing for a while now.
[06:08.420 --> 06:17.480]  And now if he's going to become a sauce thing in this also, I think we're definitely, there's going to be like some kind of war. I don't think we're going to be thrilled with that.
[06:17.480 --> 06:22.320]  Civil war. Yeah, it's, it's going to be like an Avengers civil war type of situation.
[06:22.320 --> 06:28.580]  But to be fair, Face Jam didn't start the whole Nick laughing thing. That was an RT podcast thing. That's true.
[06:29.100 --> 06:34.060]  That's true. He used to laugh many a time back on the, in the old studio.
[06:34.740 --> 06:44.440]  That's an excellent historical point, Gavin. And I'm sure, I'm sure that the members of that podcast will understand and agree completely. They're very, they're, they're definitely rational.
[06:45.540 --> 06:48.620]  I was going to say, Gavin, great point that won't matter at all.
[06:49.680 --> 06:59.760]  Nick, the people I was reading, I was reading the comments on the mall draft, which has, which has gone about as well as I could have ever imagined and hoped.
[06:59.820 --> 07:06.400]  Everybody has, I've been reading everybody's personal mall picks for their drafts, and it's just been, it's just been a lot of fun.
[07:07.200 --> 07:14.980]  But somebody in there said, I feel like after seeing Nick's mall picks, he's like the epitome of a regulation guy.
[07:15.340 --> 07:18.060]  And I thought, that's a pretty cool nickname, regulation guy.
[07:18.320 --> 07:21.220]  Oh, I like that. Yeah, I could be a regulation guy.
[07:21.380 --> 07:27.660]  Is that not what I said? And you and Gavin had a big argument about all this? Is that not, didn't we talk about that?
[07:27.660 --> 07:29.940]  Oh yeah, you did say Nick was like the most normal guy.
[07:30.280 --> 07:30.680]  Yeah.
[07:31.100 --> 07:31.980]  Gavin disagreed.
[07:32.060 --> 07:35.120]  I don't remember the terminology regulation guy being used.
[07:35.120 --> 07:35.720]  I don't either.
[07:35.760 --> 07:37.940]  I don't either, but like, is that not, is that not what he...
[07:37.940 --> 07:39.380]  In spirit, yes.
[07:39.640 --> 07:40.000]  Yes.
[07:41.160 --> 07:46.020]  So does it, who, um, preliminary numbers, obviously it's only been out a few hours.
[07:46.580 --> 07:47.860]  Who's winning the mall draft?
[07:49.180 --> 07:55.200]  I mean, according to these images that Nick doctored and threw up here, he is winning in the second one.
[07:55.980 --> 07:58.320]  But in the other one, I am ahead barely.
[07:59.020 --> 07:59.260]  Wow.
[07:59.360 --> 08:04.400]  I will be putting up a poll on the YouTube channel. I could actually do it now and see kind of like where it lands a little bit.
[08:04.400 --> 08:08.080]  I, um, I was explaining it to Meg and she was really into the idea.
[08:08.180 --> 08:11.780]  She did her own little draft and then I played her everyone's picks.
[08:12.180 --> 08:12.860]  What did she pick?
[08:13.640 --> 08:15.320]  She picked so many that were on there.
[08:15.380 --> 08:19.880]  She picked, uh, Auntie Anne's and she also picked that Suncoast video or whatever it was called.
[08:20.080 --> 08:20.120]  Hell yeah.
[08:20.660 --> 08:25.840]  She, she, she thought Eric had some amazing picks and she thought mine were complete dog shit.
[08:27.860 --> 08:30.340]  She's a regular, I like Meg a lot.
[08:30.400 --> 08:31.340]  She's a normal person.
[08:32.280 --> 08:33.160]  She's great.
[08:33.160 --> 08:35.660]  My sense when we recorded it was that Eric won.
[08:36.060 --> 08:39.760]  I didn't want to say anything ahead of time to tilt anything, but that was my feeling.
[08:39.940 --> 08:45.060]  Well, let me tell you, I have gotten, uh, nothing but support from the Gen X crowd, so...
[08:45.060 --> 08:46.900]  I think it may be generational.
[08:47.760 --> 08:51.540]  I, yeah, I do enjoy that we all seem to have our little niche somewhat for that.
[08:51.680 --> 08:54.500]  Like, I've seen a lot of people supporting Zellers, which is great.
[08:54.940 --> 08:56.400]  I've seen people with Gavin's picks.
[08:57.280 --> 08:58.020]  It's, uh, it's nice.
[08:58.300 --> 08:59.980]  Dude, Greg's gets a lot of love.
[09:00.160 --> 09:02.720]  Greg's and Zellers, I would say, have gotten the most love.
[09:02.720 --> 09:04.300]  You gotta go for regional love sometimes.
[09:04.860 --> 09:06.520]  Yeah. No, no love for gamers.
[09:10.740 --> 09:13.100]  I think it might be just a little too old for the audience.
[09:14.340 --> 09:20.640]  Hey, uh, Gavin, I have a really minor Gavin thing I wanted to tell you that happened to me today.
[09:20.780 --> 09:22.100]  A Gavin story that happened to me today.
[09:22.640 --> 09:22.880]  Okay.
[09:23.620 --> 09:30.140]  I was at the coffee shop that I go to, oftentimes in the day, on a nice day, to sit outside and write for F*** Face.
[09:30.660 --> 09:36.920]  Uh, and so I was there writing for F*** Face, getting all my notes together, and then working on this other thing I've got for y'all eventually.
[09:38.220 --> 09:42.560]  And, uh, I heard somebody behind me call out an order for Gavin.
[09:43.080 --> 09:45.180]  And it's like a coffee place and a taco place behind me.
[09:45.280 --> 09:50.760]  And I thought, oh, how funny would it be if Gaver is at the same coffee shop as I am at the same time.
[09:50.820 --> 09:52.400]  It would be so lovely to run into you.
[09:52.560 --> 09:54.140]  So I turned around to see if it was you.
[09:54.340 --> 09:55.720]  And of course it was not you.
[09:55.800 --> 09:57.220]  It was another guy named Gavin.
[09:57.220 --> 10:01.220]  But, this other guy named Gavin was also British.
[10:02.760 --> 10:09.960]  So, just want you to know, there's another British Gavin walking around the coffee shops of Austin impersonating you.
[10:10.240 --> 10:11.960]  Have you ever met a non-British Gavin?
[10:14.160 --> 10:14.600]  Uh...
[10:14.600 --> 10:18.220]  I exclusively... Really? I view that as like an exclusively...
[10:18.860 --> 10:21.200]  Yeah, we had someone who went for a wrist-teeth-cool Gavin.
[10:21.700 --> 10:23.040]  Yeah, okay. Fair enough.
[10:23.040 --> 10:26.220]  I just... I don't think I've... I've encountered two Gavins.
[10:26.480 --> 10:30.560]  You and Gavin and Stacy both very, like, distinct.
[10:31.060 --> 10:31.600]  Very European.
[10:33.200 --> 10:36.260]  Yeah, I mean, I definitely think Gavin is a British-y name.
[10:36.640 --> 10:39.160]  But it got me wondering, like, is it a very common name in England?
[10:39.300 --> 10:41.440]  Like, do you run into a lot of other Gavins in England?
[10:41.640 --> 10:44.740]  Because I never... It just didn't cross my mind that there would be another Gavin in Austin.
[10:45.000 --> 10:46.480]  No, I don't think I've ever met another English one.
[10:48.500 --> 10:51.460]  I'm not sure how I feel about two Austin Gavin British people.
[10:51.460 --> 10:54.420]  I brought it up because I thought it would irk you.
[10:54.660 --> 10:56.800]  Yeah, I wanted to get under your skin a little bit.
[10:57.160 --> 11:00.700]  Maybe we should meet up and one of us should go official... I might have to go official on Ramscoop.
[11:00.820 --> 11:01.400]  I don't know what to say.
[11:03.460 --> 11:07.780]  Well, thank God you've got that... that backup that you need to pull the cord.
[11:08.480 --> 11:10.980]  I know. I wonder how many Gavins there are in Austin.
[11:11.360 --> 11:15.320]  It almost sounds like you need to, like, put out a get-together of some kind.
[11:15.860 --> 11:19.560]  Like a news alert of, like, all Gavins must gather at a certain point.
[11:19.560 --> 11:21.020]  Do you have your, um...
[11:21.020 --> 11:22.900]  I do. I got the Andrew Payton... yeah.
[11:23.760 --> 11:29.580]  I'm in an Andrew Payton group chat, so I think you need to do the Austin equivalent of that for Gavins.
[11:30.940 --> 11:31.380]  Huh.
[11:31.540 --> 11:32.640]  I wonder how many there would be.
[11:33.200 --> 11:35.960]  I don't know how I would get the word out. Like, how would people see it?
[11:36.380 --> 11:38.540]  On your Facebook account that you don't use?
[11:40.760 --> 11:41.920]  Uh, yeah. Billboard.
[11:42.380 --> 11:46.720]  You could get a plane to fly around with a sign on the back of it.
[11:46.780 --> 11:47.680]  This is Gavin Meetup.
[11:47.680 --> 11:51.000]  I just hope that all the Gavins in Austin are just looking up that day.
[11:51.280 --> 11:53.700]  Yeah. I think the billboard is the way to go.
[11:54.080 --> 11:57.480]  Also, coffee shops. Post a flyer at all the coffee shops around town.
[11:57.480 --> 11:57.940]  Oh, flyers are great.
[11:58.420 --> 11:59.760]  Just like it's a band concert.
[12:01.580 --> 12:02.500]  I'll see what I can do.
[12:03.020 --> 12:03.680]  I think it's a good idea.
[12:03.920 --> 12:05.600]  There's at least one more of you out there.
[12:06.240 --> 12:07.740]  Uh, and he loves coffee.
[12:08.620 --> 12:11.540]  I can't... I don't... I don't know how many Andrews I've encountered.
[12:11.780 --> 12:16.320]  I know you've rarely, like, rarely met any other Geoffs. Right, Geoff? With, like, a G spelling, specifically?
[12:16.320 --> 12:20.000]  I mean, there's one with R-T. I worked with one at Rooster Teeth.
[12:20.320 --> 12:23.820]  But you made a note when you brought them up that that's, like, very rare.
[12:24.180 --> 12:30.120]  Yeah, I think I've... I've encountered maybe three in my life.
[12:30.500 --> 12:32.460]  Can I ask something?
[12:32.640 --> 12:32.780]  Of course.
[12:32.780 --> 12:34.960]  Because I have this saved as a tweet draft.
[12:36.060 --> 12:39.180]  And it was bothering me and I figured I could bring it up with you, Geoff.
[12:39.320 --> 12:41.540]  Because you spell your name G-E-O-F-F.
[12:41.900 --> 12:45.700]  The way that that is spelled is like this in chat.
[12:45.700 --> 12:48.740]  Geoff, J-E-F-F is like G-E-O-F-F.
[12:49.100 --> 12:49.180]  Yeah.
[12:49.340 --> 13:00.640]  If there's a name, like, Jess, can you do G-E-O-S-S? Or is that... can you not... is that not the same?
[13:01.060 --> 13:13.020]  I think that... well, first off, I'll preface this by saying what I have to tell everybody when they bring up my name and then ask me questions is if I had any choice in the matter.
[13:13.020 --> 13:22.820]  I didn't pick the name Geoff. I didn't, like, as a teenager, go, I think I feel like a Geoff. I was born with it. My mom picked it.
[13:23.140 --> 13:29.180]  She was, like, 18 and it was the 70s and I don't know, but I assume she was on drugs.
[13:29.460 --> 13:32.200]  Like, I don't know where the inspiration came from.
[13:32.620 --> 13:41.500]  The only other Geoff I ever knew was Geoffrey the Giraffe, which was pretty cool because he was the... Geoffrey the Giraffe was the gateway to all fucking toys in my childhood.
[13:41.500 --> 13:45.860]  And so, I like your G-E-O-R-E-M-Y. Jeremy.
[13:47.860 --> 13:55.500]  So, like, I don't know. I don't... I certainly don't claim any sort of authority over the machinations of how to spell a Geoff.
[13:55.940 --> 14:02.260]  But I'll also say it seems like all bets are off with names. People have the dumbest, weirdest, craziest spellings for names left and right.
[14:02.380 --> 14:07.500]  So, yes, I think that there probably is a G-E-O-S-S that's pronounced Jess.
[14:07.500 --> 14:12.200]  And there probably is a Jerry Seinfeld spelled G-E-O-R-R-Y.
[14:13.120 --> 14:14.640]  Jerry... G-E-R-R-Y...
[14:14.640 --> 14:18.500]  I've just been writing names with it. G-E-R-R-Y Seinfeld.
[14:20.120 --> 14:27.460]  Do you think, Geoff, if you were given the choice to name yourself, let's say when you were like 10, is there any world where you'd end up with Geoff?
[14:27.820 --> 14:28.360]  No, I'd be T-Bo.
[14:28.860 --> 14:32.160]  You'd be T-Bo. But at 10? How long have you been sitting on T-Bo?
[14:32.160 --> 14:37.480]  You named yourself. You did name yourself. You changed your name.
[14:37.820 --> 14:39.100]  I've actually changed my name twice.
[14:40.460 --> 14:42.380]  But not my first name.
[14:43.260 --> 14:48.460]  I know, but you keep saying, like, yeah, my mom picked this thing. You changed your name twice.
[14:48.740 --> 14:52.360]  Okay, yes, but there's very specific reasons, right?
[14:52.720 --> 14:54.160]  Like, I was born...
[14:55.840 --> 15:00.900]  Can I be honest with you? I like the name Geoff. I really do.
[15:00.900 --> 15:08.700]  And I like the way it's spelled. G-E-O-F-F-R-E-Y. Maybe it's just because it's the first name I learned how to spell, but it makes sense to me.
[15:09.060 --> 15:16.600]  And it feels like me. Like, I feel like a G-Geoff. I feel like I embody whatever a G-Geoff is, good and bad.
[15:16.980 --> 15:23.940]  And so I'm really down with it. The other names, I could give two fucks about. The middle names and the last names, that's why I changed those. Like, I fucking changed underwear.
[15:24.340 --> 15:26.860]  Like, that doesn't matter to me. But Geoff is the important one.
[15:26.860 --> 15:37.040]  I also really like my birthday. It's just, to me, it's like the main day. It's the first day that I had to remember. It looks really good written down.
[15:37.400 --> 15:44.720]  But I assume it's just, everyone feels that way about their own birthday. Like, this looks great to me. I love the way that looks.
[15:45.980 --> 15:53.040]  Really? That's a good looking birthday. Can I tell you something? This is something I wanted to talk about, and it's what a funny fucking transition to it.
[15:53.040 --> 16:02.700]  I was thinking about, Andrew and I have spent a lot of time talking about how to specifically create content of and about our birth years.
[16:02.940 --> 16:09.460]  And we've been bouncing around ideas back and forth for, actually, Andrew, we've probably been talking about these bits for way longer than fuckface.
[16:09.540 --> 16:12.080]  I think we've been talking about this kind of stuff for four or five years, maybe even.
[16:13.820 --> 16:15.500]  Sixth round draft day.
[16:17.580 --> 16:19.500]  Do we do a birthday draft?
[16:21.140 --> 16:27.460]  But we've been talking about how interesting it would be to live as an adult in the year that you were born, via popular culture or whatever.
[16:28.240 --> 16:36.640]  And so I was thinking about my birthday the other day, and I realized I have a really unique birthday, almost kind of a perfect birthday in a way.
[16:36.640 --> 16:44.480]  I always recognized that having a June birthday is great, because you get presents every six months, like right then in the middle of the year you have a birthday party.
[16:44.780 --> 16:50.260]  And you don't get combo gifts like being born in January or December like Jack and some sad people.
[16:52.360 --> 16:55.920]  So it's kind of spaced out evenly, but I was also born in 1975.
[16:56.660 --> 17:04.580]  So I was born in the exact middle of the 70s, and then I was born in the middle month of that year.
[17:04.580 --> 17:08.240]  And then I was born four days off the middle of that month.
[17:08.660 --> 17:16.320]  I've almost got, I'm almost, I was almost born exactly in the dead fucking center of the 1970s.
[17:16.360 --> 17:18.960]  So you're like the extra medium of the 70s.
[17:18.960 --> 17:23.820]  I am an extra medium of, I'm the 70s, I'm the extra medium of the 1970s.
[17:23.840 --> 17:27.940]  And I would say that 1974 and 1976 would be like medium, you know?
[17:27.940 --> 17:29.820]  Yeah, that makes sense to me. That makes sense to me.
[17:30.080 --> 17:37.260]  And I'll tell you what, I'll relinquish the crown to anybody who wants to approach me and tell me they were born June 16th, 17th, or 18th of 1975.
[17:37.620 --> 17:39.460]  But until I meet that person, I'm keeping that.
[17:40.280 --> 17:43.940]  I've never considered my birthday in that way. That was a very good argument, Geoff.
[17:44.100 --> 17:45.940]  You just sold me on your birthday being great.
[17:46.440 --> 17:52.020]  I think it's a great, I think, I mean, I don't know why, but it's weird to be born smack dab in the middle of something, you know?
[17:52.560 --> 17:59.080]  It is. I like it. I like you've sold it very well. What about you, Gavin? What is the perk outside of it just looks nice?
[17:59.160 --> 18:01.060]  Do you have any other reason for why you like your birthday?
[18:01.320 --> 18:02.520]  As far as structure?
[18:02.840 --> 18:08.480]  Not really, outside of just it's a nice time of year. May, the 23rd of May is usually a good chance of sun.
[18:08.580 --> 18:10.800]  Okay. Good chance of sun. Great.
[18:12.200 --> 18:13.320]  What's funny about that?
[18:13.700 --> 18:17.900]  Well, it's just, yeah, you know, I said it was a sixth round birthday. I'm standing by that. Sixth round.
[18:18.760 --> 18:21.260]  Nice chance of weather, if that's your main selling point.
[18:23.120 --> 18:32.640]  I mean, it's mainly downsides. I feel like no matter your background, all that stuff, there's a huge disadvantage, I think, to being one of the youngest people in the year.
[18:33.360 --> 18:41.560]  And I'm like, I'm not the youngest. I'm not an August kid. But I feel like it's the people born in September really win.
[18:41.640 --> 18:41.900]  Yeah.
[18:42.200 --> 18:43.000]  When it comes to school.
[18:43.220 --> 18:43.940]  I disagree.
[18:44.380 --> 18:44.820]  Really?
[18:44.820 --> 18:51.440]  Yeah, my daughter was born 23 days after the school year started. And so she was born 23 days too late to join.
[18:51.600 --> 18:56.960]  And so she had to do an entire extra year of kindergarten because they wouldn't let her start at the right time.
[18:57.160 --> 18:59.460]  She's gonna graduate at 19 instead of 18.
[19:00.000 --> 19:00.380]  What?
[19:00.980 --> 19:07.060]  Yeah, like the cutoff for when you can join is like September, I don't know, like it was like September 8th or something.
[19:07.060 --> 19:15.420]  And she was born right after it. So they made her they held her back a year and she couldn't start fucking she couldn't start kindergarten or first grade for another year.
[19:15.660 --> 19:22.760]  Because that's why Millie had Millie has like an extra year of school in her that doesn't count because she had to do an extra year of either preschool or kindergarten.
[19:22.960 --> 19:23.340]  That's bollocks.
[19:23.760 --> 19:24.320]  Yeah, it sucks.
[19:25.080 --> 19:30.060]  Dude, I graduated at 17. Millie's gonna graduate at almost 19.
[19:31.140 --> 19:31.360]  Wow.
[19:31.580 --> 19:31.840]  Goddamn.
[19:32.380 --> 19:33.060]  Yeah, it sucks.
[19:33.360 --> 19:34.200]  That's a shit birthday.
[19:34.200 --> 19:38.320]  September sucks. Like August would be great. September is fucking dog shit.
[19:38.620 --> 19:40.780]  Wait, how is August better?
[19:41.220 --> 19:45.540]  Because it's before that cutoff. So then you'd be the youngest kid in your school. That's why I was the youngest kid in my school.
[19:45.600 --> 19:47.020]  So you wanted to be the youngest?
[19:47.800 --> 19:58.520]  Yeah, you get out the door faster. Like I was set, I joined the army at 17. Everybody else around me was already well into their 18s or 19s when they were graduating high school.
[19:58.780 --> 20:01.480]  I felt like I graduated early just because I got lucky with my birthday.
[20:02.300 --> 20:07.440]  I always just felt like I was an extra year of dumb. Like I hadn't lived long enough to be at school yet.
[20:08.220 --> 20:10.140]  You and I just saw things totally differently.
[20:10.820 --> 20:16.940]  I think you would have felt that no matter what. I think that's just you. I don't think that's specific to when you're born.
[20:17.260 --> 20:21.500]  I definitely felt like when I was at school, I definitely felt like I shouldn't be here yet.
[20:23.720 --> 20:29.260]  I shouldn't be here yet? Like what do you mean by that? Like how long, like you needed more time? What does that mean?
[20:31.340 --> 20:40.480]  Uh, I could have done with starting school. I don't know. I hated school. All of history was just wasted on me.
[20:40.560 --> 20:45.720]  And now I love it. I wish I could. I wish you could pick the subjects you want to do and do all the rest later.
[20:47.140 --> 20:54.620]  Were you like sitting in math class and going like, oh boy, I should have gotten another year before coming into this one.
[20:54.620 --> 21:00.320]  I felt like that was the case. Like I was, I was in front of these books, like everyone's cracking on.
[21:00.520 --> 21:05.820]  And I would just be like, this just isn't for me yet. Not yet.
[21:06.800 --> 21:13.300]  There were some times where it would always freak me out where I'd be, we'd all be like sat looking at the chalkboard or whatever,
[21:13.420 --> 21:20.220]  listening to the teacher and I would just zone out. And then it like, I'd be five minutes in to everyone else.
[21:20.220 --> 21:27.140]  Just like head down writing. And I would just zone back in and be like, oh, what are we doing? And I would just be not being able to.
[21:27.280 --> 21:31.120]  Happened to me so often. And you think that's because of your birthday?
[21:31.740 --> 21:38.540]  Well, I just wasn't ready to be there. I just wasn't, I couldn't focus good.
[21:39.860 --> 21:44.880]  I think if I was born in September and I was the year ahead, you know, I'd be, I'd be ready.
[21:45.140 --> 21:49.120]  You'd be like sitting in class going, I already know this stuff. I'm a year older.
[21:49.120 --> 21:55.080]  No, I'd be there with everyone. Where the teacher would be like, all right, do all these sums, uh, do work through them.
[21:55.180 --> 21:59.400]  I'd be, I'd be listening and be like, okay. And it'd be some other idiot who was just staring at the ceiling.
[22:00.980 --> 22:04.580]  Well, what if, what were you born in May? So yeah, is it months?
[22:05.280 --> 22:09.560]  Now look at that kid. He needs another three months under his belt before he can tackle this interaction.
[22:10.960 --> 22:15.820]  I'm just imagining like Billy Madison, like levels of like, that's what Gavin would have been ready.
[22:15.820 --> 22:20.440]  Like he's a full grown adult. He's like, you know, I'm ready. I'm going to take this on now. I can really grasp this.
[22:20.440 --> 22:25.380]  Honestly, I could have been a year later on maths, uh, probably a year later on English and maybe 10 years later on history.
[22:26.740 --> 22:31.000]  I agree with the history thing. Maybe it's a cultural thing. Same.
[22:31.300 --> 22:40.640]  Maybe it's a cultural thing, but in America, growing up in America, like getting through school faster and younger was, was prized.
[22:40.640 --> 22:47.120]  And like we had shows like Doogie Howser, where everybody wanted to be like Neil Patrick Harris and graduate high school at 15 to go be a doctor.
[22:47.340 --> 22:51.900]  People like all kids around me were always studying to skip grades so they could get through it faster.
[22:52.120 --> 22:56.700]  It just like, it was, it's very competitive in that way, at least through my childhood.
[22:57.380 --> 23:04.060]  Yeah. I feel like the incentive in this country is just to get working, crack on, get through education and get, get earning.
[23:04.060 --> 23:09.520]  That makes sense. Get started with your life. Yeah. I didn't view it that, I guess I hated school as well.
[23:09.620 --> 23:18.540]  And the allure of like finishing faster was not at all related to academic success, but to just be done with it, just to be able to move on to whatever next.
[23:19.660 --> 23:23.300]  Yeah. I've got a clip. You got a clip? Oh God.
[23:29.440 --> 23:36.720]  Like, I don't know what it is when he says it. I'm terrified every time. It's just going to be something. It's just gonna, I wonder what it's going to be.
[23:36.800 --> 23:46.440]  Gavin, I would like to know the ratio of which these clips are like, I feel like it's 80% something dumb I've said, and then maybe like 20% calling you out on something.
[23:46.500 --> 23:49.760]  Eric, I don't think we've ever gotten a Geoff clip. Oh, I agree. I agree.
[23:49.760 --> 23:57.280]  No, there's been Geoff clips. I think it's going to be me. I'm ready for it to be me. Gavin, whenever you're ready, attack.
[23:57.520 --> 24:00.800]  Don't worry guys, you've got nothing to worry about. All right, here we go.
[24:01.800 --> 24:09.440]  I have by my measurements, a 26 inch back. Oh! 26 inches.
[24:10.300 --> 24:11.120]  And then this?
[24:12.080 --> 24:22.160]  A, you're an idiot. And B, do you think you could eat 24 inches of pancakes? That seems like a lot.
[24:22.400 --> 24:30.040]  I just liked that I called you an idiot and then immediately got the number on. Like, I immediately forgot the number you just told me and I was two inches off.
[24:30.780 --> 24:33.680]  You used a clip to call yourself out?
[24:33.680 --> 24:43.140]  I gotta keep things fair. We went all that time remembering the number, or like to find out the number of when he finally said it, I just disregarded it immediately.
[24:43.500 --> 24:48.900]  I remember hearing that and thinking that you just picked a number. It didn't connect to me that you forgot. That was great.
[24:49.600 --> 24:53.780]  I bet if you were born in September, you wouldn't have been so stupid as to call yourself out.
[24:56.440 --> 24:57.600]  Damn, that's funny.
[25:01.240 --> 25:09.020]  What are we looking at? What is this? Nick posted a photo of a Zelda character, I'm guessing? That's how many pancakes a Zelda is.
[25:09.480 --> 25:15.800]  Is that, do those percentages, yeah, do they correlate? Are they pretty close to what Andrew said his back percentages were?
[25:15.900 --> 25:18.580]  Yes, way close. He's a Zona. Interesting.
[25:19.100 --> 25:20.680]  Are you like a Zona, Andrew?
[25:21.500 --> 25:25.540]  Yeah, I am. That's actually my birth sign, I believe, is a Zona.
[25:25.540 --> 25:27.380]  I'm not sure what August is.
[25:30.340 --> 25:36.220]  Yeah, I'm a definite Zona. I mean, I don't know why we need the Zona in here, we already, I submitted before, I'll send it again, regulation.
[25:36.820 --> 25:48.580]  It's just, this picture is so fucking funny to me. It's just, it's you, and you're waving, it's so funny. I love it.
[25:48.740 --> 25:51.280]  It's gonna be the thumbnail for last week's episode.
[25:54.200 --> 26:01.900]  His face, his face is so, he's got his little toes. I think he's got a drawstring on the pants.
[26:03.060 --> 26:05.740]  It's so funny. I love it. I love it so much.
[26:06.260 --> 26:12.800]  It's got your expression down so fucking well. I don't even know how to put it into words, but it looks so much like you.
[26:14.440 --> 26:17.900]  I realized another way recently of how I was dumb for something.
[26:17.900 --> 26:23.420]  I just remembered that I didn't, I learned something probably in my early twenties that I should have learned a lot sooner.
[26:23.860 --> 26:29.280]  Okay. And I just remembered this the other day. I thought, I thought Bicentennial meant robot.
[26:33.700 --> 26:39.260]  Because of that movie, The Bicentennial? Yeah, because of Robin Williams. I thought it was like Cyborg Man.
[26:39.260 --> 26:54.260]  And then, and then I heard Americans celebrating the Bicentennial and I was like, was it like some sort of major robot incident that people was...
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.660]  Centennial. You guys, you guys don't have robot day in England?
[27:01.520 --> 27:05.140]  I was like, what's this robot day about? Oh my God.
[27:06.200 --> 27:11.300]  I must've been like 21 or 22 when I realized that Bicentennial meant 200.
[27:13.180 --> 27:15.160]  That is incredible.
[27:16.540 --> 27:21.160]  It makes so much sense when you have like millennial and centennial. I'm an idiot.
[27:22.960 --> 27:28.680]  The robot in this movie, they made look like Robin Williams.
[27:31.000 --> 27:31.280]  Yeah.
[27:31.280 --> 27:36.040]  Have you seen that movie? No.
[27:36.920 --> 27:40.700]  I've also read the book. It's an Isaac Asimov. It's much better book than a movie.
[27:41.080 --> 27:48.080]  Yeah. I mean, it eventually becomes Robin Williams. Like it becomes realistic enough to look like he just looks like a man.
[27:48.620 --> 27:53.180]  Oh, that's interesting. Bicentennial. That's amazing.
[27:53.420 --> 27:54.400]  That's so fucking funny.
[27:54.400 --> 28:03.660]  I have the reverse of that, that I was going to ask you guys about, of if there are things that you've forgotten how to do that you shouldn't, like you should still know how to do.
[28:04.280 --> 28:15.000]  I have a, this is an incredibly stupid one. I'm just going to say like, I'm aware this is really dumb. I can no longer sleep facing right.
[28:15.760 --> 28:16.800]  On my right side.
[28:17.660 --> 28:36.220]  I used to be someone who would like sleep for a while on my left and then roll over to my right. And I can't sleep on my right. I cannot get comfortable. Like I can't find the angle. Everything feels off. Like I can't, I can't do it. Somewhere in the last eight months, I have lost the knowledge of how to lay on my right side. And it has been troubling.
[28:36.580 --> 28:40.080]  Is it just a comfort thing? Or are you like putting pressure on a piece of your body that you don't like?
[28:40.080 --> 29:00.600]  I think it's all of it. Like it's, it feels awkward in certain parts of my body. I don't know how to adjust because I've been isolating with COVID. Like I have this entire king sized bed to myself. I'm like, Oh, maybe if I just shuffle more, but I've learned with the entirety of the bed, I just end up on the other side of the bed. I just keep adjusting. Like, I can't figure it out. I don't know how to lay on my right now. It's gone.
[29:00.600 --> 29:05.120]  And that's the good side to sleep on, right? Because your stomach wants to be tilted on the left.
[29:05.280 --> 29:10.640]  It's not great. I didn't know that. I just know that it's, it's not, I can't get comfy on my right side.
[29:10.820 --> 29:17.650]  I think this, I think I remember reading something like the stomach is because it's directional. It's better for it to be on one side for comfort.
[29:19.120 --> 29:20.680]  I don't remember. I don't remember what the reason is.
[29:20.680 --> 29:29.520]  That's it. So do you, it's interesting. I sleep, I have the same, I have a problem. I have to sleep a certain way too, but I have to sleep facing the door.
[29:30.180 --> 29:33.320]  Like with my back to a wall. Like I have to sleep facing the threat.
[29:33.620 --> 29:35.240]  Yeah. You think it's like a military thing?
[29:35.640 --> 29:42.980]  I don't know if it's a military thing or just like a, I don't know, like maybe it's just like a caveman thing that's, you know, in me.
[29:43.180 --> 29:46.620]  But, uh, but yeah, I always feel like I always think about it. I always have to sleep facing.
[29:46.620 --> 29:50.580]  So if I like, like nobody will be behind me, they'd have to go around me to get behind me.
[29:50.620 --> 29:55.000]  So I, if I sleep and I open my eyes, I can see what's in front of me. I know nothing could sneak up on me. Yeah.
[29:55.360 --> 29:56.040]  That's interesting.
[29:56.420 --> 30:01.900]  I find that I wake up sometimes having absolutely no idea where I am, especially when I'm in a hotel, I think I'm somewhere else.
[30:02.860 --> 30:03.820]  Absolutely. Of course.
[30:04.160 --> 30:09.080]  So, so you can easily sleep in a hotel where the door is the other way to your bedroom and you would just switch.
[30:09.600 --> 30:12.580]  Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes. Yeah, I do. I think it annoys Emily, but yeah.
[30:14.080 --> 30:18.120]  I always just sleep on the side of the bed closest to the door facing the door.
[30:18.340 --> 30:22.100]  Whatever that is. Interesting. Hmm.
[30:22.420 --> 30:23.740]  Oh, Nick does it too, he says. Yeah.
[30:24.460 --> 30:28.700]  It's not something I even like. It's not something I consciously ever decided to do.
[30:28.740 --> 30:30.740]  It's just always been how I do it.
[30:31.040 --> 30:32.180]  What if the door is at your feet?
[30:32.520 --> 30:35.040]  I feel like any any direction works at that point.
[30:35.180 --> 30:37.840]  I think that frees them up. Yeah. As opposed to limit.
[30:38.000 --> 30:40.680]  I don't know. I think I just don't sleep on my side then sleep on my back.
[30:44.280 --> 30:48.480]  I was trying to think of a room where the doors are at the feet of the bed.
[30:48.600 --> 30:53.780]  But then I remember Geoff that time we stayed in that really romantic room in San Antonio.
[30:54.400 --> 30:56.020]  Do you remember that? Yeah.
[30:58.720 --> 31:02.120]  We stayed in like a honeymoon suite in a hotel together one night.
[31:02.140 --> 31:07.380]  And I slept on the couch on the outside of the amazingly lavish bedroom.
[31:07.660 --> 31:08.860]  I slept in the bed.
[31:08.860 --> 31:13.400]  Yeah. I think that's when we were sending pictures of each other under the covers.
[31:14.900 --> 31:18.140]  We were like two hours. We just got some funny pictures of each other.
[31:19.280 --> 31:22.500]  Oh God. That was fun. That was fun.
[31:22.680 --> 31:24.560]  Why did we stay in that room?
[31:25.120 --> 31:29.380]  I don't remember. I think because I know I know why.
[31:29.460 --> 31:31.940]  Because it was like my favorite hotel in San Antonio. It's called the Havana Hotel.
[31:33.620 --> 31:35.980]  And we were there for a basketball game or something.
[31:36.720 --> 31:38.540]  And steaks. And steaks.
[31:38.540 --> 31:40.780]  And they had a great steak restaurant. Really good.
[31:41.020 --> 31:43.500]  And a nice green sauce, whatever they put on it.
[31:43.800 --> 31:44.960]  Yeah, like chimichurri sauce.
[31:45.240 --> 31:49.060]  And then they had a really cool basement bar that was like really, really fucking cool.
[31:49.580 --> 31:52.540]  And I was there one time when the hotel flooded with sewage.
[31:52.680 --> 31:55.340]  And the basement bar started filling up with shit while I was there and we had to run out.
[31:57.820 --> 32:00.400]  Didn't enjoy the bar the rest of the weekend at that time.
[32:00.780 --> 32:05.860]  But anyway, I got us a two bedroom hotel room so that we could each have our own room.
[32:05.860 --> 32:09.220]  And it just turned out that it was a bedroom and then a sofa for you.
[32:11.160 --> 32:13.260]  Nice sofa though. Oh, it's fine.

[36:35.820 --> 36:39.720]  Hey, I've been writing down my morning thoughts again if anybody's interested.
[36:40.080 --> 36:42.260]  I'd love to hear your morning thoughts. I have a few myself.
[36:42.780 --> 36:45.120]  Okay, here's what I have in no particular order.
[36:45.840 --> 36:49.480]  Actually, I guess maybe they're in dated order.
[36:49.480 --> 36:54.760]  The first thing I wrote down... I don't know what day this was but...
[36:54.760 --> 36:57.960]  I woke up and for some reason, it's not even a song that I like,
[36:58.300 --> 37:01.960]  I woke up and I thought, I need to listen to Tragedy by the Bee Gees.
[37:03.260 --> 37:07.080]  And I did. And I was like, I don't like this song. I don't know why I want to listen to this.
[37:08.020 --> 37:12.920]  The next day I woke up and my first thought was, I need a broccoli pouch.
[37:13.440 --> 37:17.320]  I don't know what that means. I don't even want to invent a broccoli pouch.
[37:17.320 --> 37:21.640]  I don't know where I was going with that. That was just my first thought was, I need a pouch for broccoli.
[37:21.980 --> 37:26.100]  Maybe it's a way to cook broccoli without releasing the stink into the rest of the house.
[37:26.360 --> 37:28.780]  Oh, maybe that's interesting. Maybe that's where I was going.
[37:28.980 --> 37:34.840]  Or maybe it could be like a urine thing. You know, like something that cooks things that create the smell of broccoli when you piss.
[37:35.120 --> 37:37.800]  Because you're on that for a while. You're deep in the broccoli smell.
[37:38.580 --> 37:38.940]  That's true.
[37:39.640 --> 37:51.260]  The next day I woke up. I don't know if this counts exactly, but I was having a bad dream where like a, you know, like the scariest thing to me is the exorcist, like believable religion.
[37:51.620 --> 37:55.180]  And I was having one of those kind of dreams where the devil was real.
[37:55.360 --> 38:00.220]  And I got I touched something I wasn't supposed to touch. And it gave me the devil's diarrhea.
[38:01.520 --> 38:04.820]  And then I woke up and I realized that I had real, very real diarrhea.
[38:04.820 --> 38:08.660]  And I shit for about an hour straight at four in the morning.
[38:10.020 --> 38:10.840]  What'd you eat?
[38:11.060 --> 38:17.500]  And I don't even know. And then the next day I woke up and I thought my throat hurts.
[38:17.760 --> 38:19.360]  That was COVID, turns out.
[38:20.900 --> 38:26.300]  The next the next day I woke up and I don't even know what I don't remember writing this down and I don't know what it means.
[38:26.560 --> 38:31.720]  But I guess I wrote I wrote down my first thought was no one hits vegetables anymore.
[38:33.380 --> 38:35.020]  You're really on that vegetable kick.
[38:35.120 --> 38:38.320]  I guess I guess the next day I woke up.
[38:38.380 --> 38:39.240]  What does that mean?
[38:39.580 --> 38:41.500]  I don't know. I don't know. I don't even remember writing it.
[38:41.540 --> 38:42.640]  I don't even remember writing it.
[38:43.960 --> 38:49.420]  The next day I woke up and my first thought was the killer has white nail polish.
[38:50.500 --> 38:54.460]  So if you're looking for any murderers out there, maybe check for white nail polish.
[38:54.560 --> 38:56.520]  Don't know what that must have been a part of a dream I had.
[38:57.240 --> 39:02.160]  And then the thought I had this morning when I woke up was I should get my bones stretched.
[39:03.620 --> 39:04.740]  That sounds terrible.
[39:05.220 --> 39:11.060]  I think because I read an article about a model who grew like five inches by getting her bones and her legs stretched.
[39:11.200 --> 39:12.060]  I don't want to do that.
[39:12.140 --> 39:12.920]  I'm happy with my height.
[39:13.120 --> 39:15.040]  Stretch like when that was my very first thought.
[39:15.120 --> 39:16.720]  Yeah, they like stretching surgery.
[39:17.000 --> 39:17.620]  Yeah, no.
[39:18.160 --> 39:18.560]  There you go.
[39:19.080 --> 39:20.620]  Those are those are all my first thoughts.
[39:20.620 --> 39:26.940]  Now, when you were casted, when when Devil's Diarrhea was was thrust upon you, did you say step back, Satan?
[39:27.040 --> 39:27.960]  I got shit and shades.
[39:28.940 --> 39:30.960]  No, I don't think shit and shades were in there.
[39:32.500 --> 39:34.140]  And I didn't feel very cool.
[39:34.980 --> 39:37.440]  I didn't I didn't wear shades at that point, either.
[39:37.460 --> 39:38.480]  I wasn't feeling very cool.
[39:38.560 --> 39:42.420]  That was just like just horrendous diarrhea.
[39:42.600 --> 39:45.640]  It probably was related to covid, actually, because it was right before I found out I had it.
[39:45.640 --> 39:49.700]  Oh, man. The Devil's Diarrhea.
[39:50.140 --> 39:50.500]  Devil's Diarrhea.
[39:50.500 --> 39:53.400]  That is like such a design by hell from you.
[39:53.760 --> 39:54.880]  Like that is there's nobody.
[39:55.100 --> 40:00.940]  If you gave me a list of things of like who came up with this, I would always put Devil's Diarrhea as a Geoff.
[40:01.360 --> 40:02.340]  That's a Geoff creation.
[40:04.520 --> 40:05.820]  Mine aren't as good as yours.
[40:05.840 --> 40:06.960]  Sounds like it'd be a hot sauce.
[40:07.960 --> 40:08.920]  Oh, man.
[40:09.580 --> 40:15.200]  That's we should face ever gets into hot sauce, which is apparently a huge market and a big moneymaker.
[40:15.340 --> 40:17.860]  We should make face presents the Devil's Diarrhea.
[40:18.400 --> 40:19.660]  Yeah, I like it.
[40:19.920 --> 40:21.320]  That's going to be our hot sauce.
[40:21.400 --> 40:23.180]  Stick it in the cookbook.
[40:25.820 --> 40:28.460]  Tony, can we make can we make hot sauce?
[40:28.800 --> 40:31.440]  I have a good nickname that I woke up with.
[40:31.540 --> 40:32.800]  I don't know where this came from.
[40:32.840 --> 40:33.680]  Kind of food related.
[40:33.780 --> 40:34.380]  I was like, you know what?
[40:34.400 --> 40:35.160]  This this person.
[40:35.440 --> 40:36.880]  This is a fucking cool name.
[40:36.880 --> 40:37.960]  I can get this name.
[40:38.240 --> 40:39.180]  Not for me.
[40:39.300 --> 40:42.000]  I think it's a cooler name than what I would ever deserve.
[40:42.140 --> 40:44.280]  But that's a memorable name.
[40:44.560 --> 40:45.640]  Johnny Caviar.
[40:46.800 --> 40:47.760]  Johnny Caviar.
[40:47.900 --> 40:48.560]  My first thing.
[40:49.180 --> 40:50.300]  I don't know where it came from.
[40:50.760 --> 40:51.780]  Johnny Caviar.
[40:52.060 --> 40:54.040]  This has been in my head ever since.
[40:55.240 --> 40:55.720]  Andrew.
[40:56.240 --> 40:56.560]  Andrew.
[40:56.560 --> 40:56.980]  Great nickname.
[40:57.240 --> 41:02.160]  Maybe Johnny Caviar could be like an Errol situation for you.
[41:02.640 --> 41:07.220]  Feeling like a little cocky, a little lux, a little fancy, a little Gucci.
[41:07.640 --> 41:09.540]  Maybe Johnny Caviar comes out.
[41:09.720 --> 41:13.120]  Oh, I like it.
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.120]  I'm going to develop Johnny Caviar a little bit.
[41:16.660 --> 41:17.260]  This is great.
[41:19.320 --> 41:22.060]  I think that is definitely a direction you should get it.
[41:22.120 --> 41:22.980]  You should look into going.
[41:23.120 --> 41:24.080]  I'm going to explore this.
[41:24.600 --> 41:25.340]  Johnny Caviar.
[41:25.600 --> 41:28.220]  The other morning thought I have is we're being attacked.
[41:28.220 --> 41:31.820]  Anytime I wake up due to like any noise in the world.
[41:31.960 --> 41:34.040]  I just assume we're being attacked.
[41:34.300 --> 41:37.120]  That's just a regular that covers most days.
[41:37.320 --> 41:38.780]  Hopefully you're facing the door.
[41:39.280 --> 41:40.920]  Yeah, I'm panicking instantly.
[41:41.300 --> 41:43.180]  Doesn't matter what the noise could be a bird chirping.
[41:43.340 --> 41:45.560]  If it wakes me up, it's ah, like what?
[41:45.780 --> 41:48.620]  What is who?
[41:48.940 --> 41:49.720]  That's me.
[41:50.360 --> 41:53.540]  Disoriented and ready to argue or fight with whatever's happening.
[41:54.920 --> 41:56.200]  My third one.
[41:56.400 --> 41:57.880]  And this is a dream.
[41:57.880 --> 42:02.080]  I do ever have dreams that like you wake up and then you go back into it and you have the dream.
[42:02.220 --> 42:02.940]  Yeah, like you continue.
[42:03.460 --> 42:04.360]  I had this.
[42:04.560 --> 42:06.620]  I thought this was such a genius.
[42:06.860 --> 42:07.040]  I did.
[42:07.040 --> 42:07.960]  This is such a dumb thing.
[42:08.200 --> 42:09.440]  And this was a genius idea.
[42:09.500 --> 42:13.100]  My dream to the point where I would wake up and I'd be like, I got to remember this.
[42:13.140 --> 42:17.060]  And I remember the name and I go back to bed and it would still be in whatever the next three months.
[42:17.860 --> 42:20.380]  The third idea is chungle.
[42:21.000 --> 42:22.580]  It's a game called chungle.
[42:23.180 --> 42:24.920]  Let me pitch this to you.
[42:24.980 --> 42:25.840]  It's chungle.
[42:25.920 --> 42:27.220]  C-H-U-N-G-L-E.
[42:28.720 --> 42:29.800]  You know what it is?
[42:30.180 --> 42:32.240]  You know like an auto runner type game?
[42:32.380 --> 42:34.080]  You know like mobile games like Mario Run?
[42:34.500 --> 42:35.220]  That type of thing?
[42:35.620 --> 42:35.700]  Yeah.
[42:35.840 --> 42:41.520]  It's Mario Run in a jungle with chungusy animals in it.
[42:41.820 --> 42:45.240]  It's a bunch of like cute big chungusy animals and they run around the jungle.
[42:45.800 --> 42:47.120]  And so it's called chungle.
[42:49.700 --> 42:51.800]  I was very excited about this.
[42:52.140 --> 42:54.880]  I was assigned to make chungle in my dream.
[42:55.140 --> 42:56.960]  And I was like, this is a great fucking idea.
[42:56.960 --> 42:57.580]  I gotta remember.
[42:57.740 --> 42:58.820]  I can't forget chungle.
[42:58.920 --> 43:00.380]  I gotta get to work on this.
[43:00.420 --> 43:01.520]  You just clear a checkpoint.
[43:01.680 --> 43:02.980]  It's like, that's chungle.
[43:03.200 --> 43:07.300]  Eric just posted a photo of a very large tiger.
[43:07.480 --> 43:09.400]  Yes, that's the chungle type vibe.
[43:09.400 --> 43:10.520]  Like a bunch of chungle animals?
[43:10.780 --> 43:17.080]  Like a bunch of chungly animals running around, jumping over logs, swinging on vines.
[43:18.480 --> 43:19.860]  This episode is nuts.
[43:19.980 --> 43:22.900]  This is like a dream of an episode.
[43:23.380 --> 43:23.820]  It is.
[43:24.520 --> 43:25.560]  It's been tough to sleep.
[43:25.560 --> 43:27.340]  I think I talked about this before.
[43:27.420 --> 43:28.520]  I've got this bird on my roof.
[43:28.620 --> 43:29.520]  I don't know what it is.
[43:29.620 --> 43:31.200]  It's waking me up constantly.
[43:31.660 --> 43:32.580]  It's so annoying.
[43:33.060 --> 43:34.100]  It's just on the roof?
[43:34.580 --> 43:35.420]  No, it's living...
[43:35.420 --> 43:38.340]  There's a panel in my building that broke off a while ago.
[43:38.580 --> 43:40.040]  And birds have moved into it.
[43:40.120 --> 43:43.800]  And there's one bird in particular that I hear cawing through my vent sometimes.
[43:43.980 --> 43:44.780]  And it wakes me up.
[43:45.060 --> 43:46.940]  Do you think that's where your doorbell button ended up?
[43:47.480 --> 43:48.500]  It could be.
[43:48.780 --> 43:49.760]  I think we talked about that.
[43:49.800 --> 43:52.520]  That it could have been stolen by one of the birds.
[43:53.620 --> 43:54.380]  It's terrible.
[43:54.380 --> 43:56.640]  I want you to figure out what it is.
[43:56.980 --> 43:57.860]  I've been trying to figure it out.
[43:58.240 --> 44:00.460]  You download that Merlin app for your phone, but it crashes.
[44:00.640 --> 44:02.140]  There's other apps, though, that'll do that.
[44:02.540 --> 44:03.060]  Oh, really?
[44:03.680 --> 44:05.700]  Yeah, there's other brands you can...
[44:05.700 --> 44:07.860]  I mean, I have recordings of it.
[44:07.920 --> 44:08.660]  I just don't...
[44:08.660 --> 44:11.000]  I haven't been able to use the app because it just crashes.
[44:11.420 --> 44:14.040]  Oh, if you have recordings of it, you can send me the recording.
[44:14.620 --> 44:15.260]  And then I...
[44:15.260 --> 44:17.840]  Or if you can play a recording...
[44:18.560 --> 44:19.600]  No, that might not work.
[44:19.900 --> 44:22.260]  Why don't you just learn how to do an impression of the bird?
[44:23.140 --> 44:24.420]  I'm just gonna...
[44:24.920 --> 44:26.260]  Sort of, it's like a...
[44:27.160 --> 44:27.420]  Ah!
[44:29.880 --> 44:31.320]  I'm still dealing with COVID here.
[44:31.440 --> 44:32.020]  This is not easy.
[44:32.400 --> 44:34.220]  Yeah, you sound a bit stopped up.
[44:34.220 --> 44:34.900]  No, I'm not good.
[44:35.440 --> 44:38.260]  We recorded last week and I was like, I got it.
[44:38.360 --> 44:40.360]  This is gonna be not fun, but it'll be fine.
[44:40.420 --> 44:42.400]  And then everything post then has been awful.
[44:42.860 --> 44:44.700]  Did you get hold of some of them pills that Geoff was talking about?
[44:45.180 --> 44:47.840]  No, I forgot that they existed until yesterday.
[44:47.840 --> 44:50.180]  And I thought that's a real dumb mistake by me.
[44:50.180 --> 44:53.280]  I just, I bought a lot of Gatorade and a lot of Powerade.
[44:53.540 --> 44:57.420]  And I'm really stupid, because I bought Gatorade and Powerade simultaneously.
[44:58.000 --> 45:02.760]  And then Powerade on their label says 50% more electrolytes than the leading sports brand.
[45:02.920 --> 45:05.060]  So I became strictly a Powerade guy because of that.
[45:06.300 --> 45:07.340]  Red Powerade...
[45:07.340 --> 45:11.360]  Red Powerade is the best tasting of all the AID drinks.
[45:11.940 --> 45:12.480]  They're pretty good.
[45:14.340 --> 45:15.360]  It's pretty good.
[45:16.560 --> 45:17.700]  Best AID drink.
[45:18.020 --> 45:19.560]  It's the best AID drink, it really is.
[45:19.560 --> 45:20.660]  Red Powerade.
[45:20.980 --> 45:21.460]  It's the greatest.
[45:21.720 --> 45:23.080]  Regular Red Powerade.
[45:23.640 --> 45:23.800]  Yeah.
[45:24.460 --> 45:26.560]  I prefer blue a little bit, but...
[45:27.140 --> 45:29.620]  I wish you had gotten on that Paxlova, dude.
[45:29.660 --> 45:31.480]  Because I had COVID for four fucking days.
[45:31.780 --> 45:33.480]  It was over before it began.
[45:33.900 --> 45:34.000]  Yeah.
[45:34.380 --> 45:37.440]  I tested positive on Monday and I was negative on Friday.
[45:38.660 --> 45:39.800]  It was just like...
[45:39.800 --> 45:42.220]  Why didn't you drop off the games for me to send to Andrew then?
[45:43.160 --> 45:45.180]  Well, I wanted to give myself some grace.
[45:45.720 --> 45:46.560]  Just in case.
[45:47.020 --> 45:48.440]  You know, I don't want to like...
[45:48.440 --> 45:50.440]  Just because I got two negative tests doesn't mean...
[45:50.440 --> 45:51.980]  You know, you just want to be safe with your friends.
[45:52.080 --> 45:52.980]  I already gave it to Gus.
[45:53.180 --> 45:54.220]  I want to give it to you too.
[45:55.940 --> 45:57.800]  Gus went so long without having it.
[45:58.400 --> 46:00.520]  Hey, you guys just reminded me.
[46:00.860 --> 46:03.440]  I didn't even think I was going to talk about this, but I might as well.
[46:03.940 --> 46:07.000]  Do you guys remember when I had that $40,000 flush?
[46:08.140 --> 46:08.340]  Yes.
[46:08.700 --> 46:09.020]  Oh, yeah.
[46:09.400 --> 46:11.480]  And it broke and then it cost...
[46:11.480 --> 46:16.420]  I had this week the next closest thing to that.
[46:16.420 --> 46:18.820]  And it's already fixed and taken care of.
[46:18.920 --> 46:21.520]  I had a light go out in my kitchen.
[46:22.100 --> 46:24.580]  Where I was just like standing under it and the light just turned off.
[46:24.700 --> 46:27.040]  And I checked all the fuses and everything and the light just wouldn't turn back on.
[46:27.620 --> 46:29.200]  You know how much it cost to fix that light?
[46:30.000 --> 46:30.440]  How much?
[46:31.100 --> 46:31.880]  $13,000.
[46:32.360 --> 46:33.320]  Oh my God.
[46:33.580 --> 46:34.040]  Wait, what?
[46:34.620 --> 46:35.060]  What?
[46:35.400 --> 46:35.840]  Yeah.
[46:36.580 --> 46:37.600]  What do you mean?
[46:40.320 --> 46:43.960]  The electric in my house is ramshackle at best.
[46:43.960 --> 46:45.360]  You know, my house is...
[46:45.360 --> 46:46.740]  It's like every house in Austin.
[46:46.880 --> 46:51.540]  It's 100 years old and it's cobbled together from like three different houses during three different generations.
[46:51.820 --> 46:55.840]  And I knew that I was going to have to do some pretty significant electric work.
[46:57.140 --> 46:59.640]  Like get the electric from the...
[46:59.640 --> 47:05.600]  Like I draw more power from the fucking pole than it can handle.
[47:05.880 --> 47:06.960]  And so I have to get the pole...
[47:06.960 --> 47:09.040]  Like the city to fucking upgrade.
[47:09.140 --> 47:10.560]  Oh, there's just a bunch of stuff going on.
[47:11.320 --> 47:19.400]  And when that light failed, it created a series of cascading problems that required me to get pretty much all the electrical in my house redone.
[47:20.100 --> 47:22.040]  So were they like ripping the walls open and stuff?
[47:23.040 --> 47:25.080]  Only one wall got ripped open.
[47:25.460 --> 47:26.460]  Most of it was on the outside.
[47:27.840 --> 47:30.120]  They had to replace all my breakers.
[47:31.620 --> 47:32.560]  Oh my God.
[47:32.760 --> 47:33.720]  Yeah, and I have three.
[47:34.020 --> 47:36.060]  Not because I have like a big house or anything, I don't.
[47:36.060 --> 47:40.320]  But because my house was built, like I said, like the first part of my house was built like in the 30s.
[47:40.400 --> 47:43.460]  And they built an addition in like the 50s and an addition in the 90s.
[47:43.520 --> 47:46.560]  And so they just kept adding breaker boxes and daisy chaining them.
[47:46.680 --> 47:47.900]  And it's just a fucking mess.
[47:48.120 --> 47:50.400]  And so I got it all fixed this week.
[47:50.740 --> 47:52.860]  I was only without power, Nick, for a day.
[47:52.980 --> 47:55.100]  So I was without power yesterday actually.
[47:55.520 --> 47:55.760]  Oh my God.
[47:55.760 --> 47:57.500]  It worked out really great that we were recording today.
[47:58.140 --> 47:58.500]  Wow.
[47:58.660 --> 47:59.600]  Got it all fixed though. Yeah.
[47:59.960 --> 48:01.460]  And it was just to fix one light?
[48:01.460 --> 48:03.580]  Well, the light, the light.
[48:04.520 --> 48:05.920]  No, it was to fix the problem.
[48:06.380 --> 48:07.900]  My house wasn't grounded properly.
[48:08.460 --> 48:15.480]  Like I had to watch these guys fucking hammer eight foot long like brass spikes into the ground.
[48:15.580 --> 48:16.600]  Grounding rod and shit.
[48:16.760 --> 48:17.680]  Yeah, grounding rods and shit.
[48:17.780 --> 48:19.440]  Like they had to do so much.
[48:19.560 --> 48:27.100]  It was basically they had to like unfuck a lot of bad like home electrician work and then upgrade everything.
[48:27.620 --> 48:29.860]  I didn't have surge protectors anywhere in my house.
[48:29.860 --> 48:31.660]  Like just had to do a bunch.
[48:31.880 --> 48:34.280]  And now I have them like in my wall next to my breakers.
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.540]  So it's like a devil's electricity situation.
[48:37.820 --> 48:38.220]  Yeah.
[48:38.880 --> 48:39.140]  Yeah.
[48:39.280 --> 48:39.640]  Yeah.
[48:40.220 --> 48:41.820]  And I mean, it sucks.
[48:42.740 --> 48:43.660]  It sucks a lot.
[48:44.160 --> 48:47.900]  It sucks a whole lot because I did not have the money to do it.
[48:47.900 --> 48:56.200]  But I feel better that the house is safer now and it's not going to burn down, you know, because the guy was like, how long you been living here?
[48:56.240 --> 48:57.040]  And I was like four years.
[48:57.080 --> 48:58.640]  And he's like, Jesus Christ, man.
[48:58.640 --> 48:59.760]  I'm glad you're OK.
[48:59.940 --> 49:00.860]  And I was like, thanks.
[49:00.920 --> 49:01.280]  Me too.
[49:02.140 --> 49:06.540]  Was there no... did nothing of that get flagged on the inspection when you bought the place?
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.120]  It was flagged that I needed to upgrade some stuff.
[49:09.220 --> 49:09.400]  Yeah.
[49:09.700 --> 49:12.100]  But not how dire the situation was.
[49:12.380 --> 49:21.640]  But I already knew that because I had had an electric guy come out and look about moving like moving some electric to the like for some like home renovation stuff.
[49:21.740 --> 49:26.560]  And he was he looked at it and he told me he was like, I'm not I wouldn't touch the electricity in your house for less than $10,000.
[49:26.900 --> 49:28.100]  And I was like, OK, don't touch it.
[49:28.100 --> 49:28.640]  See you later.
[49:29.600 --> 49:30.240]  And then.
[49:31.280 --> 49:33.100]  At the end, then it became a necessity.
[49:34.460 --> 49:36.440]  But anyway, it got fixed in like two days.
[49:36.880 --> 49:43.120]  It was just like two days of work and, you know, I decimated my savings and stuff, of course, but but my house isn't going to burn down.
[49:43.540 --> 49:48.020]  And now I'm fucking my plumbing and my electric is so fucking on point.
[49:48.400 --> 49:49.920]  I'm just trying to put in my fridge.
[49:50.140 --> 49:50.400]  Yeah.
[49:50.700 --> 49:51.800]  Focus on the positive.
[49:52.340 --> 49:52.520]  Yeah.
[49:52.800 --> 49:53.840]  What's next?
[49:54.420 --> 49:54.820]  HVAC?
[49:55.380 --> 49:55.700]  Roof.
[49:56.140 --> 49:57.520]  I know HVAC was first.
[49:57.520 --> 49:59.220]  I replaced the HVAC.
[49:59.540 --> 50:02.000]  My HVAC died three weeks after I moved into the house.
[50:02.100 --> 50:03.360]  That was the first thing, wasn't it?
[50:03.740 --> 50:03.960]  Yeah.
[50:04.120 --> 50:04.820]  Yeah, that was number one.
[50:05.020 --> 50:06.000]  OK, so roof next.
[50:06.440 --> 50:07.180]  Roof's next, I think.
[50:07.360 --> 50:07.460]  Yeah.
[50:08.560 --> 50:09.940]  Well, at least you don't have slime.
[50:11.000 --> 50:11.360]  Yeah.
[50:11.440 --> 50:12.360]  What's going on with the slime?
[50:12.760 --> 50:13.240]  Pretty similar.
[50:13.660 --> 50:13.780]  Pretty.
[50:14.440 --> 50:15.040]  Still slimy.
[50:17.580 --> 50:19.400]  Do you have an endgame with the slime?
[50:19.880 --> 50:21.120]  Are you just keeping track of it?
[50:21.300 --> 50:24.220]  I want to see if it starts consuming wildlife.
[50:25.400 --> 50:25.760]  Yeah.
[50:25.760 --> 50:30.460]  If I see bugs embedded in the slime, I'm going to start worrying.
[50:31.580 --> 50:32.820]  I think it's a good time to worry.
[50:33.880 --> 50:35.040]  I think you should scoop some of it.
[50:35.340 --> 50:36.940]  Have you taken any more process photos?
[50:37.700 --> 50:38.500]  No, I looked at it.
[50:38.700 --> 50:41.200]  Well, I think it's not changed enough.
[50:41.500 --> 50:43.580]  I'll maybe take another picture of it next week and give you an update.
[50:44.100 --> 50:44.300]  OK.
[50:45.100 --> 50:46.180]  Do you have a microscope?
[50:46.920 --> 50:47.120]  Yeah.
[50:47.820 --> 50:49.140]  Oh, you think I should take a sample?
[50:49.520 --> 50:50.700]  Why don't you take a sample?
[50:50.700 --> 50:50.920]  You should absolutely take a sample.
[50:51.020 --> 50:52.600]  Yeah, and look at it under the microscope.
[50:53.040 --> 50:53.340]  Ooh.
[50:54.060 --> 50:54.880]  That's a great idea.
[50:54.880 --> 50:57.160]  You should wear gloves probably when you do that.
[50:57.440 --> 50:59.040]  Yeah, and don't put it in your mouth.
[50:59.140 --> 51:00.960]  But, yeah, look at it with your eyes.
[51:02.100 --> 51:04.840]  Can I put some in a little jar and we'll have it in the museum?
[51:05.840 --> 51:06.420]  What if...
[51:06.420 --> 51:07.300]  Oh, I think that's a great idea.
[51:07.600 --> 51:09.000]  Stop adding things to the museum!
[51:10.680 --> 51:13.960]  Why can't we constantly add to the museum until the very last minute, Eric?
[51:15.020 --> 51:16.240]  Yeah, that's what's going to happen.
[51:16.500 --> 51:16.920]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[51:16.920 --> 51:18.000]  Because I have to deal with it.
[51:18.120 --> 51:21.120]  And then it's a bunch of people going, oh, well, this wasn't on this list.
[51:21.180 --> 51:22.480]  And it's like, I don't fucking know.
[51:22.640 --> 51:23.360]  Just put it there.
[51:23.360 --> 51:24.980]  And then we just have to stick stuff places.
[51:25.340 --> 51:30.340]  And we already had this conversation where I said stop adding stuff to the museum and everyone said okay.
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.360]  But we didn't know Gavin was growing an alien symbiote.
[51:34.020 --> 51:37.720]  Yeah, and don't end the cut off to the museum three months before the museum opens.
[51:37.860 --> 51:42.660]  I don't know who you think you're dictating that to, but certainly it's not me.
[51:43.260 --> 51:46.860]  You think I'm the one who's going, yeah, man, I really want to make this cut off happen.
[51:49.080 --> 51:52.100]  I don't think the slime should... I think the slime in the museum is a bad idea.
[51:52.280 --> 51:53.000]  I think it might be too dangerous.
[51:53.000 --> 51:54.740]  I'm reversing that. Yeah, I don't...
[51:54.740 --> 51:55.820]  It'd be a nice job.
[51:56.480 --> 52:01.240]  No, but somebody's going to steal the slime from the museum and then it's going to get mixed with something.
[52:01.440 --> 52:03.000]  And then there's going to be another pandemic.
[52:03.360 --> 52:04.100]  That's how that works.
[52:04.220 --> 52:05.820]  Or they're going to turn into a supervillain.
[52:05.960 --> 52:10.000]  Or it's going to be like a brain eating amoeba that wipes out a small town in Iowa.
[52:10.380 --> 52:12.340]  I was thinking this about the museum.
[52:12.420 --> 52:14.660]  I hope we actually have real security for the museum.
[52:14.940 --> 52:16.380]  Well, we're going to have no scrumping signs.
[52:17.480 --> 52:18.920]  I just don't want this stuff stolen.
[52:19.780 --> 52:22.460]  Do you think... there's no way there's going to be real security.
[52:23.060 --> 52:24.180]  I think there has to be.
[52:24.800 --> 52:25.900]  There's no way.
[52:26.200 --> 52:26.840]  What do you mean?
[52:27.080 --> 52:28.820]  It's their cherished item.
[52:29.440 --> 52:35.520]  There's got to be a bored grad student sitting on a plastic chair somewhere playing on their phone.
[52:35.920 --> 52:37.240]  To find security.
[52:38.180 --> 52:40.740]  Their cherished item is what Gavin said.
[52:40.960 --> 52:41.500]  And it's a fight.
[52:41.760 --> 52:42.980]  Yeah, I want to put slime in it.
[52:42.980 --> 52:44.600]  Yeah, but like I look at the Thrice to Meet You.
[52:44.680 --> 52:45.600]  I'm looking at it right now.
[52:45.780 --> 52:46.680]  I love that thing.
[52:46.800 --> 52:47.460]  I love it.
[52:47.860 --> 52:49.320]  I want to keep it.
[52:49.840 --> 52:52.940]  I want insurance on my Thrice to Meet You.
[52:53.520 --> 52:57.880]  You got it. I'll get a Lloyd's of London insurance policy on all this stuff.
[52:58.300 --> 53:06.540]  It would be a real insult to the tuxedo if the Thrice to Meet You gets stolen and the tuxedo is left behind like this grand heist happens.
[53:06.980 --> 53:09.440]  I do agree with that. I absolutely agree with that.
[53:09.900 --> 53:13.020]  Somebody steals the slime, but the tuxedo is untouched.
[53:14.060 --> 53:18.260]  I want to keep this stuff or it needs to be auctioned for charity, but I don't want it stolen.
[53:18.260 --> 53:24.700]  Wouldn't it be cool if we could eventually auction off some of our museum items for more than the tuxedo sold?
[53:25.720 --> 53:27.340]  We have, I think, technically.
[53:27.960 --> 53:28.380]  Have we?
[53:28.800 --> 53:33.120]  I think the fuck hats have gone for more than the tuxedo did.
[53:33.800 --> 53:34.280]  That's great.
[53:34.700 --> 53:36.100]  I think we've already surpassed that.
[53:36.440 --> 53:43.700]  I was talking about it today with someone and explaining that the value of a Don Zimmer card has shot up exponentially because of the show.
[53:43.960 --> 53:44.060]  Yes.
[53:44.320 --> 53:46.880]  It's insane. It's insane that that happened.
[53:46.880 --> 53:55.580]  I think it was a subreddit post where somebody went to like a charity, like a thrift store type thing, and they were selling the Don Zimmer card for $10.
[53:56.200 --> 54:03.680]  And the person asked about it and they said that they were set at that price because the person looked on eBay and that's what the value was at that time.
[54:03.820 --> 54:07.880]  Like we've shifted the market even within that store, which is so funny.
[54:08.440 --> 54:10.160]  I wonder what the Don Zimmer card market is now.
[54:10.440 --> 54:13.060]  You think it's going to be lower than it was?
[54:13.060 --> 54:18.360]  The way it always works with card collecting, because there's no like... when I was a kid, there was the Beckett card guide, right?
[54:18.740 --> 54:22.700]  And that was like the definitive way you looked it up. And it still exists, but nobody pays attention to it.
[54:22.960 --> 54:28.800]  Now you just... it's like whatever the most expensive it ever sold for on eBay is now what everybody considers to be the price.
[54:29.080 --> 54:34.440]  So because Don Zimmer cards sold for $10 and $15 and $20, they will forever be considered at that price.
[54:34.880 --> 54:35.540]  That's so funny.
[54:36.840 --> 54:44.580]  You know how a few episodes ago we were talking about William Hartnell, the first doctor, and how he's younger than Brad Pitt when he was the doctor and all that stuff?
[54:44.860 --> 54:45.680]  Yeah. Yes.
[54:45.980 --> 54:53.640]  In a similar vein to like people being old and stuff. I was watching The Godfather 2 last night, or G2 as TPG would call it.
[54:53.820 --> 55:02.500]  And I thought it'd be fun to go back in time to Robert De Niro here and let him know that he'll have a baby in 50 years.
[55:05.780 --> 55:12.700]  And how just weird and messed up that is. Like right there he's 50 years from having a baby.
[55:13.180 --> 55:21.200]  Have you seen the internet discourse the last week of who's hotter? Like peak De Niro or peak Pacino?
[55:21.960 --> 55:22.900]  Have you seen this at all?
[55:23.060 --> 55:27.060]  How do you... where do you weigh in on that, by the way, Eric? It's been all over the internet.
[55:27.640 --> 55:31.820]  Twitter, I guess, but like you could weigh in here. Who do you think it is?
[55:31.820 --> 55:36.760]  I mean, I've looked at the photos and it's pretty clear to me that it's Pacino, but they're both good looking dudes.
[55:36.760 --> 55:37.300]  I would say Pacino.
[55:37.860 --> 55:38.320]  Interesting.
[55:38.560 --> 55:39.500]  Yeah, I would agree with that.
[55:39.500 --> 55:49.800]  There's also a scene in Godfather 2 where De Niro is holding Pacino's character as a baby. And I think it'd be cool if they recreated that in real life.
[55:50.200 --> 55:57.600]  Like just got out Pacino to lie down in Robert De Niro's lap and leave him like... I think that'd be really nice.
[55:58.780 --> 56:10.820]  What's great about the work and the legacy of Pacino and De Niro is that they're not above that. That could happen. You just need enough money. You just need that to be in a Sandler script and you're set. That could happen.
[56:11.500 --> 56:20.340]  Man, there was a character on Survivor this week that did a Pacino... or last week that did a Robert De Niro impression and it made me not like Robert De Niro.
[56:21.940 --> 56:32.100]  That's the problem with De Niro. When people do a bad De Niro impression, it makes you dislike De Niro, even though it's not his fault. And I know people do bad Al Pacino impressions too, but I feel like they're not nearly as common.
[56:32.500 --> 56:32.600]  No.
[56:32.760 --> 56:36.040]  I mean, in that movie, De Niro's doing a Marlon Brando impression, really.
[56:36.380 --> 56:37.540]  Yeah, that's true.
[56:38.080 --> 56:48.500]  I, for some reason, I look at young De Niro in that picture, compared to the older one below, and I see the same person. I cannot see young Al Pacino in old Al Pacino.
[56:48.900 --> 56:49.340]  Really?
[56:49.340 --> 56:51.500]  No, I just don't see the resemblance.
[56:51.920 --> 56:55.280]  I totally agree with you, dude. 100%.
[56:55.280 --> 56:58.380]  Like, Godfather 1 Pacino doesn't look like that guy.
[56:59.020 --> 57:03.620]  Yeah. That's the poll result with 277,000 votes.
[57:03.620 --> 57:04.580]  Oh, wow.
[57:05.600 --> 57:06.600]  It's 50-50.
[57:07.080 --> 57:07.320]  Yep.
[57:08.240 --> 57:10.080]  Yeah, like, that's not the same guy.
[57:10.220 --> 57:12.340]  Does not look like him at all, but...
[57:14.200 --> 57:15.160]  Same guy.
[57:15.240 --> 57:16.180]  De Niro looks like De Niro.
[57:16.500 --> 57:16.700]  Yeah.
[57:17.300 --> 57:17.440]  Yeah.
[57:17.940 --> 57:20.060]  Al Pacino looks like a beetle in that photo.
[57:24.940 --> 57:27.160]  He does look like a beetle's hair.
[57:27.540 --> 57:27.740]  Yeah.
[57:27.880 --> 57:29.440]  His little turtleneck, that's so funny.
[57:29.560 --> 57:29.860]  Yeah.
[57:30.440 --> 57:31.840]  I'm fucking, I'm just so dumb.
[57:32.480 --> 57:39.920]  You told me, you told me a thing to take for what I have, and I instead ordered six more bottles of Gatorade, was my response.
[57:40.340 --> 57:42.740]  I didn't even look up what you suggested.
[57:43.200 --> 57:43.940]  Can you get it there?
[57:44.600 --> 57:46.120]  Maybe, I don't know, I should look.
[57:46.120 --> 57:52.500]  I'm already, I'm like at the tail end of it, so it feels like it would be pointless at this stage, but maybe I should.
[57:53.180 --> 57:57.500]  Could I share something that made me really laugh the other day that I discovered?
[57:58.600 --> 58:00.860]  We are a Cosmic Crisp podcast.
[58:01.680 --> 58:02.080]  Yes, we are.
[58:02.720 --> 58:10.240]  I feel like there's maybe a time in which I thought, oh, it'd be fun to like find another like Apple or something, or maybe like a free agency period.
[58:10.720 --> 58:12.060]  I don't think we can do that now.
[58:12.860 --> 58:15.260]  Cosmic Crisp is incredibly loyal to us.
[58:15.260 --> 58:23.600]  I accidentally logged into our Twitter account the other day, and I saw that we were tagged in a post.
[58:24.800 --> 58:27.600]  Let me put it in chat right now.
[58:28.700 --> 58:31.220]  This is what Cosmic Crisp tweeted a few days ago.
[58:32.140 --> 58:34.920]  Let's settle this at FacePod debate.
[58:35.220 --> 58:35.960]  Oh, my lord.
[58:36.260 --> 58:37.900]  Are you a horizontal biter?
[58:38.600 --> 58:39.720]  Biter, Jesus Christ.
[58:39.820 --> 58:42.720]  Are you a horizontal biter or a vertical biter?
[58:43.500 --> 58:44.780]  I thought that's funny.
[58:44.780 --> 58:46.800]  That's fucking crazy that they tagged the show.
[58:47.020 --> 58:47.900]  That's great.
[58:48.280 --> 58:48.900]  And we didn't reply?
[58:49.540 --> 58:50.440]  We didn't reply.
[58:50.600 --> 58:51.740]  Well, we suck at social media.
[58:52.360 --> 58:53.240]  But I looked at it.
[58:53.380 --> 58:54.620]  I just thought, oh, that's really funny.
[58:54.800 --> 58:59.100]  And then a few days passed, and I thought about, am I vertical or horizontal?
[58:59.200 --> 58:59.860]  I think it depends.
[59:00.140 --> 59:01.500]  I didn't remember the conversation.
[59:02.020 --> 59:06.780]  And then I remembered we went through a whole like vertical wiping phase discussion debate.
[59:06.960 --> 59:09.560]  And I'm assuming that the bite conversation happened.
[59:09.660 --> 59:12.200]  I don't know if any of you guys remember having that conversation.
[59:12.380 --> 59:13.040]  I don't.
[59:13.300 --> 59:14.400]  The vertical wiping conversation?
[59:14.400 --> 59:15.400]  No, the biting.
[59:15.920 --> 59:16.340]  Vertical biting.
[59:16.540 --> 59:20.820]  I remember the wiping, but I don't remember us ever having a debate about vertical biting.
[59:20.860 --> 59:24.080]  I don't know that it was a debate, but I feel like it was definitely brought up.
[59:24.540 --> 59:24.740]  Yeah.
[59:25.000 --> 59:26.080]  I feel like it was brought up.
[59:26.120 --> 59:29.860]  Because I remember talking about the way to eat an apple, and then I have a friend who
[59:30.340 --> 59:31.980]  will eat like the entire apple.
[59:32.200 --> 59:33.240]  So I think it was brought up.
[59:33.400 --> 59:37.820]  I think I'm vertical because I want to hook my top teeth over sort of the top ridge by
[59:37.820 --> 59:38.300]  the stem.
[59:38.640 --> 59:39.360]  That's crazy.
[59:39.520 --> 59:40.480]  I think it's more complicated.
[59:41.200 --> 59:47.420]  I think my first bite is vertical, and then I turn the apple sideways and go horizontal
[59:47.420 --> 59:48.240]  all the way around.
[59:49.200 --> 59:55.860]  I think it's like a vertical entry bite, like right on the fat part, as the hump is coming
[59:55.860 --> 59:56.080]  up.
[59:56.380 --> 59:59.580]  And then you just turn it sideways, and then you just eat it like a cartoon.
[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:02.900]  So they posted that, and I thought that was really funny.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.560]  And then like a few days passed, I thought, oh my, wait, is that a reference to the vertical
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.200]  wiping thing?
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:12.940]  This is fucking crazy that this Apple company is making a reference to that.
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:16.540]  And so I pulled up the tweet again, and then I saw, oh, there's eight comments.
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:17.640]  Let me go through those.
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:18.100]  Oh, no.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:24.200]  And there were comments that were like, the account you're highlighting is a bit sketchy.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:26.420]  There's one person.
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:32.400]  Another person said, how about not engaging with an account whose name has an embedded
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.140]  obscenity?
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:35.080]  And I was like, oh, this is fucking great.
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:35.800]  These are people.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:39.360]  Every single person that replied does not follow the podcast account.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:44.980]  These are all just Cosmic Crisp people that have had this thrusted into their feed and
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:46.980]  are now reacting to it.
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:53.200]  They just follow a nice, gentle Apple account that is, hey, what's up, f*** face?
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:59.780]  How can you be, how could you consider yourself a Cosmic Crisp person and not be intimately
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:03.960]  aware with the world's biggest Cosmic Crisp fan fucking podcast?
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.060]  I call bullshit on those idiots.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:07.700]  They're not real Cosmic Crisp fans.
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:10.600]  I love that they directly tagged our account.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:11.720]  It's so funny.
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:13.040]  The person running that is not scared.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:14.500]  No, not at all.
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:15.920]  And there are people replying.
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:19.100]  And I thought, when I initially saw, like, some of the negative feedback, I was like,
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.420]  our name is censored.
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:22.460]  Like, you guys are being ridiculous.
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:24.600]  And then I realized our handle isn't.
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:28.480]  They just posted a f*** face unedited on their primary feed.
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.640]  And if you notice, it's their pinned tweet.
[01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:33.720]  It's the top tweet whenever you go to their account right now.
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:35.700]  It is the first thing you see.
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.340]  It's just f*** face.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.180]  I checked again today.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:41.800]  Phenomenal.
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:42.660]  Yeah, it's great.
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:46.840]  I checked again just to see, like, if there are any responses or if they got rid of the tweet.
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:48.060]  And they've doubled down.
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:50.920]  They're ride or die with the show.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.360]  They will protect this show.
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:58.700]  Their podcast name is a reference to a famous baseball card that thematically fits our show,
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.860]  which is about friendship and embracing foolish moments we all sometimes have.
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:03.200]  They're also big Cosmic Crisp fans.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:04.160]  Legend!
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:05.660]  Legend.
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.440]  That's a legend starting that account.
[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:11.680]  I don't know who it is.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:17.440]  I just, I f***ing love that, like, our closest, like, friend outside of the show is an Apple manufacturer.
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:18.920]  Of all the things.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.760]  Dude, they've been true blue to us.
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.980]  Andrew, you gotta get in there and respond.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.240]  And let them know what the official f*** face response is.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.160]  I'm a little bit worried to do that.
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:32.920]  Do you think we should, for RTX, just hand out some Cosmic Crisps to attendees?
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:33.540]  Yes.
[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:36.420]  Eric, what do you think of this idea?
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:37.880]  How about we add it to the museum?
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:40.380]  Oh, I don't know who we is in this situation, so I'm just not weighing in.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:44.520]  That's true. You're saying we, and half of this isn't true.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:44.860]  Yeah, should we do that?
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:47.740]  Yeah, I'll let you guys figure out if we're gonna do that.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.500]  We to Gavin means Eric and I.
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:50.160]  Yeah.
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.060]  We the company.
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:53.060]  Cosmic Crisp, Apple, oh.
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:56.240]  Oh, it's a different Nick was sharing what other podcasts have covered it.
[01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:58.200]  And we definitely have had the most coverage of it by far.
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:02:58.840]  It's a great Apple.
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:02.400]  Yeah, I mean, we've, dude, we've, we're ride or die for Cosmic Crisp.
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.420]  A hundred percent.
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:03.680]  Yeah.
[01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:05.760]  When we're not accidentally eating pink ladies.
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:07.880]  That's...
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:11.220]  I haven't had a pink lady since, at least to my knowledge.
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:20.600]  I wonder if anybody has ever gone to the grocery store and then just switched apples around.
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:25.840]  So you think you're getting the pink lady, but you're getting a like a crisp delicious or whatever.
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.060]  Oh, that's horrible.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.880]  That'd be, that'd be a terrible thing. Don't, hey, don't do that.
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:31.300]  Don't be an apple switcher.
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:36.060]  As someone who works fruit and veg, uh, that, that, that sent a tingle up my spine.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.640]  Yeah. Don't, don't be in it. Don't do apple tricks.
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:41.140]  Apple tricks.
[01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.500]  The people have seen Stuart, by the way.
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:46.460]  Yeah, they have.
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:47.480]  He's a big hit.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.360]  Great response to Stuart.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:57.860]  A lot of people, uh, complaining about, you know, what you don't see in any of those clips is after we stopped filming, I go back and have to reset everything I did.
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:04.020]  I talked about it last time, but yeah, I did work in a supermarket and I did feel too guilty leaving.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:08.860]  Even though it was a French supermarket, I felt too guilty leaving it in that state.
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:14.140]  Maybe someday in the future we can show the audience videos of Johnny Caviar.
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:18.440]  Oh, there is Johnny Caviar's brewing.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:18.960]  Okay.
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:20.200]  He's got stuff cooking.
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:25.260]  I would be so happy if instead of Andrew, Johnny Caviar shows up for my wedding.
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:32.060]  God, I'm imagining Johnny Caviar being like the host of a talent show.
[01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:34.580]  Like he's the one like introducing all the acts.
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:35.900]  Little spotlight.
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:38.440]  Big time host name.
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:39.420]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:42.500]  Um, we do need to wrap up.
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:42.920]  Oh, right.
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:43.520]  More to do.
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:45.880]  Um, but I did want to send this quickly.
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:50.140]  Uh, this is from 51 minutes ago at this point.
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:52.580]  Who won the mall draft and Gavin is in the lead.
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:55.940]  So I think that YouTube, we just kind of have to like throw out.
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:58.080]  Gavin definitely didn't win.
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.260]  Yeah, I'll be honest.
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:00.680]  I, I don't agree with that.
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:02.260]  I was taking the piss mostly.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:08.500]  Uh, one of them, one of them I pivoted to, to staples because everyone was saying staple so much.
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:11.460]  And the other one I picked an escalator.
[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:12.860]  So...
[01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:16.700]  I'd go as far as saying that this puts crack rock under review once again.
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.720]  No, no, not again.
[01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:20.080]  I stand by crack rock.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.200]  That's ridiculous.
[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:24.380]  Look at this, look at this YouTube one.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.960]  Is that, that's on YouTube you said?
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.180]  Yeah, yes.
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.220]  Look at Andrew's score.
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:29.120]  Oh, yeah.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.060]  They don't know himself.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:30.840]  All time low.
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:32.900]  They don't respect us.
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:37.120]  I think that, I think the other places are a little bit more on the up and up.
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:39.180]  I feel YouTube is a vindictive place.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.560]  I love these drafts.
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:46.000]  We, we do need to wrap up.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:46.720]  We do need to wrap up.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:47.140]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:52.380]  Let's, let's go ahead and, let's go ahead and put this thing out of its misery.
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:55.420]  And put a bullet right in its head.
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:00.620]  So that it can be reborn next week as another funny podcast that you guys will love.
[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:03.240]  That we can then kill again and then complete the cycle forever.
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:08.260]  I'm gonna leave you guys with a little bit of a, with a, something to think about.
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:09.720]  A little life hack, if you will.
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:14.240]  This comes in from my fiance who invented this life hack last week.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:18.780]  If you are ever in desire of drinking an ice cold soda.
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:22.740]  And you don't want it to be slippery and you don't have a koozie readily available.
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:29.360]  My fiance figured out that you can use a rubber band around your soda and it works just as well.
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:32.480]  There you go.
[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:34.280]  Like a thick rubber band around your soda.
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:36.100]  It won't slip out of your hands.
[01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:38.260]  You can, you can grip, you can grip it really well.
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.000]  It's still cold.
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.360]  It doesn't, it doesn't take the, it doesn't take the, the freezy temperatures away.
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.260]  Nothing will do that except for a koozie.
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.860]  But it, uh, it will keep you from, keep it from slipping out of your hands.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:48.640]  There you go.
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.740]  An extra small koozie.
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:54.700]  Rubber bands as a, rubber bands as a, as a koozie.
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:59.820]  And, uh, go ahead and tell everybody you've ever met about the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:05.820]  As a matter of fact, uh, back in the, back in a long time ago, fans of the Howard Stern Show.
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:10.800]  They would stand outside of the busy street corners with giant sandwich boards saying listen to the Howard Stern Show.
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.180]  And I'm not saying you should do that.
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:15.480]  He gets enough publicity, but, uh, you know, something to consider.
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:16.880]  We'll see you next time.
[01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:21.680]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:25.680]  The guys are running behind again on recording, so here's some guesses for next week's episode.
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.720]  It's the official back off.
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:29.780]  Panton has had it with Cosmic Crisp.
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:31.460]  Geoff applied at the mall.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.860]  Gavin debuts another alter ego.
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.160]  The boys solve the debt limit crisis.
[01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:39.020]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:42.260]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
