[00:10.580 --> 00:18.120]  52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59...
[00:20.060 --> 00:21.660]  That seemed like two seconds early.
[00:21.840 --> 00:22.280]  Uh-oh.
[00:22.600 --> 00:25.040]  It's not early. What do you want from me?
[00:27.560 --> 00:30.220]  I don't want anything. You showed up. That's all I want.
[00:30.580 --> 00:33.760]  There's no argument. There's no complaining. I just...
[00:34.340 --> 00:36.780]  Eric was on 58 when you popped into the room. That's all.
[00:36.840 --> 00:38.920]  Eric needs to learn to count to 60, firstly.
[00:39.820 --> 00:41.620]  Well, you didn't give him a chance to count to 60.
[00:41.740 --> 00:44.440]  I'm almost there. So far, I've gotten to 58.
[00:45.460 --> 00:50.140]  You know what? In defense of Gavin, I've never heard you say 60.
[00:50.600 --> 00:52.040]  I've heard you get as high as 59.
[00:52.040 --> 00:54.320]  It's true. I think I've only ever gotten...
[00:54.320 --> 00:55.460]  I have zero proof that you've gotten there.
[00:55.820 --> 00:57.920]  I don't know how we got to episode 158.
[00:58.540 --> 01:01.100]  I just have a sheet that tells me what the next one is, and that's it.
[01:01.440 --> 01:04.840]  Do you want me to be two seconds late next time just so you can get 60?
[01:04.840 --> 01:08.100]  No, I want you to... Gavin, I want you to continue to be on time.
[01:10.340 --> 01:10.900]  Alright.
[01:12.020 --> 01:16.400]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:16.780 --> 01:20.740]  This is episode 158 of season 98.
[01:21.640 --> 01:24.700]  If we're going by slang, my name is...
[01:25.420 --> 01:26.840]  Porterhouse, and with me as always...
[01:27.560 --> 01:28.980]  Hang on.
[01:30.020 --> 01:35.640]  Freezy guy, Ram Jam, and Schwartzy, and the little dog.
[01:36.140 --> 01:37.660]  What the f*** is this?
[01:39.360 --> 01:42.300]  Geoff went with a different cut of steak.
[01:42.900 --> 01:43.900]  You changed your steak name?
[01:44.000 --> 01:45.220]  I changed my steak name.
[01:45.740 --> 01:47.960]  I modified everybody's nickname a little bit.
[01:48.060 --> 01:48.580]  I don't know why.
[01:49.240 --> 01:50.520]  You don't know why? Okay, that's fair.
[01:52.900 --> 01:56.240]  Well, first off, I cannot remember Ram Scoop.
[01:56.240 --> 02:01.140]  I've been calling you Ram Rod in my head, or Ram Jam for a while.
[02:01.620 --> 02:04.780]  Ram Scoop is... I had to look it up twice in the last week.
[02:04.900 --> 02:06.680]  Because I just couldn't f***ing remember it.
[02:06.960 --> 02:11.300]  Good news for you, I have a potential replacement nickname that I found out in the world.
[02:11.660 --> 02:12.520]  And I want to run it by everyone.
[02:13.280 --> 02:15.140]  We don't have to go straight into that, but...
[02:15.140 --> 02:16.380]  No, let's go straight into it.
[02:16.540 --> 02:19.520]  Yeah, why would we leave nicknames to then redirect you back to nicknames?
[02:19.600 --> 02:20.580]  Why wouldn't we just do this now?
[02:21.980 --> 02:22.600]  Well, sure.
[02:23.220 --> 02:23.920]  Yeah, let's do it.
[02:24.960 --> 02:26.080]  Jesus Christ, man.
[02:26.300 --> 02:28.800]  Well, I'm just stalling. I'm trying to find my picture.
[02:28.900 --> 02:29.580]  Oh, I see.
[02:30.680 --> 02:33.240]  You know what? You know who wouldn't have stalled, Geoff? Ram Jam.
[02:33.480 --> 02:35.400]  Ram Jam would have stalled. Ram Jam would have been ready.
[02:35.780 --> 02:36.360]  The Rammer.
[02:36.960 --> 02:39.880]  I saw this sign in a hotel by the lift.
[02:40.760 --> 02:42.960]  It's sort of giving you the sound of the alarm.
[02:43.060 --> 02:44.120]  And what it sounds like...
[02:44.120 --> 02:44.680]  Whoop Tone!
[02:45.280 --> 02:46.600]  I think that could be my new nickname.
[02:47.380 --> 02:48.120]  Whoop Tone?
[02:48.380 --> 02:49.380]  Yeah, Whoop Tone.
[02:49.520 --> 02:53.260]  Dude, I'm all about Whoop Tone and T-Bone.
[02:53.260 --> 02:54.340]  Oh, this is great.
[02:54.380 --> 02:56.020]  Oh, I love Whoop Tone, dude.
[02:56.280 --> 02:59.960]  I'll put it to the audience. Do you like Ram Scoop or Whoop Tone?
[03:00.100 --> 03:02.200]  Because I'm leaning towards Whoop Tone.
[03:02.800 --> 03:04.740]  Isn't there like a G.I. Joe named Whoop Tone?
[03:05.580 --> 03:06.800]  What am I thinking of?
[03:07.300 --> 03:09.960]  Ripcord? Maybe I'm thinking Ripcord. Is Ripcord a G.I. Joe?
[03:11.060 --> 03:12.080]  Who's a G.I. Joe?
[03:12.720 --> 03:13.480]  Are there any...
[03:13.480 --> 03:14.580]  Who's a G.I. Joe?
[03:14.940 --> 03:16.600]  Is there a Joe in G.I. Joe?
[03:17.120 --> 03:20.720]  Are there any G.I. Joes in the audience? Raise your hand if you're a G.I. Joe.
[03:21.140 --> 03:21.240]  What?
[03:22.440 --> 03:22.800]  Slipstream?
[03:23.180 --> 03:26.100]  There was a Ripcord. There was a Ripcord G.I. Joe.
[03:26.280 --> 03:27.640]  Are you naming Decepticons?
[03:27.960 --> 03:30.800]  I don't know. Is Slipstream... Which one is Slipstream?
[03:31.320 --> 03:32.180]  He's involved, right?
[03:32.820 --> 03:33.560]  Was he a car?
[03:34.020 --> 03:34.460]  I don't know.
[03:34.700 --> 03:37.160]  Just wait until he fires up the Whoop Tone as he comes around the corner.
[03:37.480 --> 03:39.720]  Oh, he will have a great Whoop Tone.
[03:40.880 --> 03:43.820]  Would you... So here's the thing. The thing about Whoop Tone, it's long.
[03:44.200 --> 03:48.720]  Which I'm not against. This is not a criticism. I think Whoop Tone is a fucking great name.
[03:49.040 --> 03:49.560]  Yeah, it is.
[03:49.780 --> 03:50.480]  I think it's fantastic.
[03:50.480 --> 03:55.380]  How do you feel about either being called Whoop or Tone as well?
[03:55.680 --> 03:57.220]  It's like a nickname on the nickname.
[03:57.660 --> 04:00.960]  We've been trained to know that Whoop is the sound of the police.
[04:01.400 --> 04:04.180]  So it could be a problem just being Whoop.
[04:04.800 --> 04:12.100]  I think with a name like Whoop Tone, you can't truncate. I think you gotta go full Whoop Tone every time.
[04:12.940 --> 04:16.000]  The thing I like about it is it's also like...
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.360]  When would you use the term Whoop Tone? When you see him first time, right?
[04:19.400 --> 04:21.820]  It's like, oh, there's Whoop Tone. But also, it's a sound.
[04:22.000 --> 04:27.460]  So now, anytime you see Whoop Tone come into the room, in your head, you're gonna be going, whoop, whoop.
[04:28.120 --> 04:30.160]  And that's fucking kind of double awesome.
[04:30.520 --> 04:32.300]  You're telling me no one's gonna call him Tone.
[04:32.900 --> 04:33.120]  No.
[04:33.820 --> 04:34.160]  No, I won't.
[04:34.180 --> 04:34.900]  Only a fool.
[04:35.220 --> 04:36.060]  Only a fool.
[04:36.800 --> 04:39.600]  Imagine people, he's walking up, people go, hey, what up, Tone?
[04:39.780 --> 04:41.500]  You tell me that's never gonna happen.
[04:41.500 --> 04:41.960]  No.
[04:42.240 --> 04:46.100]  Then I'll tell them that funky, was it, Tom Medina, was it?
[04:46.620 --> 04:47.640]  Funky Cole Medina.
[04:48.020 --> 04:48.640]  If anything...
[04:48.640 --> 04:50.340]  I'm on your guys' side, no one's calling him that.
[04:50.540 --> 04:54.100]  If anything, people will go, whoop, when they see him.
[04:54.300 --> 04:56.880]  Can I character build on Whoop Tone, Gavin?
[04:57.220 --> 04:57.420]  Yeah.
[04:57.740 --> 05:02.940]  You need to have shoes that have the fucking, what's the groan tube?
[05:03.220 --> 05:04.380]  You need groan tube shoes.
[05:04.540 --> 05:05.460]  Oh, groan shoes.
[05:05.660 --> 05:09.520]  And Whoop Tone runs into the room, and that's the Whoop Tone.
[05:09.520 --> 05:13.520]  I'm waiting for the bus, you just hear, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[05:16.940 --> 05:18.100]  Well, alright, Tony.
[05:18.780 --> 05:20.120]  You'll never be late.
[05:20.680 --> 05:22.240]  Is that Whoop Tone I hear?
[05:22.740 --> 05:25.880]  We have to make groan shoes.
[05:26.360 --> 05:28.520]  I don't know how we do that, but that's technically...
[05:29.420 --> 05:31.540]  Eric, can you talk to Tony and Aaron?
[05:32.040 --> 05:32.540]  We need Whoop Tone shoes.
[05:32.540 --> 05:33.480]  I don't think this is complex.
[05:34.700 --> 05:35.700]  We have...
[05:35.700 --> 05:37.960]  We made the small keychain groan tubes.
[05:37.960 --> 05:39.960]  Those could definitely go...
[05:40.860 --> 05:42.200]  On the side of shoes.
[05:42.480 --> 05:44.520]  Absolutely, just tape a bunch of those on yourself.
[05:45.120 --> 05:45.640]  Groan shoes.
[05:46.540 --> 05:53.280]  Gavin, if Eric can get you a bunch of those little baby keychains, will you make a prototype where you just tape them all over your feet?
[05:53.460 --> 05:53.860]  Absolutely.
[05:54.220 --> 05:55.340]  Is that our next uniform?
[05:55.940 --> 05:57.340]  That could be a uniform, yeah.
[05:57.720 --> 05:59.020]  Gavin could invent his next...
[05:59.020 --> 06:00.060]  It could be the...
[06:00.060 --> 06:04.040]  This would be the follow-up to the Thrice to Meet You, which is a solid product.
[06:04.040 --> 06:08.200]  I feel like I've got a backlog of uniform inventions ready to go.
[06:09.260 --> 06:10.420]  Uncork that hose, buddy.
[06:11.080 --> 06:11.480]  Maybe...
[06:12.180 --> 06:14.140]  Yeah, maybe we'll have to have a sesh soon.
[06:14.180 --> 06:14.960]  A little uniform sesh.
[06:15.300 --> 06:16.400]  I can just see it now.
[06:16.620 --> 06:20.580]  Who's that pervert that was putting his hands in all the ice cream, and then...
[06:22.760 --> 06:24.320]  Tubes sprinting away in the distance.
[06:24.640 --> 06:26.520]  Dude, that's right. How's the ice gloves going?
[06:26.700 --> 06:27.580]  How's the ice cream gloves going?
[06:27.940 --> 06:29.780]  I feel like that was a real Ramscoop thing.
[06:30.020 --> 06:31.280]  And I'm Whoop Tone now, so...
[06:31.280 --> 06:32.060]  Oh, you've moved on.
[06:32.460 --> 06:32.700]  Yeah.
[06:32.700 --> 06:34.000]  That's old news.
[06:34.220 --> 06:36.320]  Well, I could... I'll still work on that prototype.
[06:36.860 --> 06:41.300]  I need to order some supplies, and I need to find out if cutting those things open is poisonous.
[06:43.320 --> 06:46.500]  I don't want to keep jumping into the episode, because I really want to let you guys go.
[06:46.580 --> 06:54.040]  I just want to appreciate Gavin, because when other people have a nickname or an alter ego, it's always just themselves.
[06:54.300 --> 06:56.060]  But Gavin really differentiates.
[06:56.060 --> 07:01.900]  He's got, like, Stuart the Bumbler or whatever, and Errol, and, like, all this stuff.
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.000]  And it's just, like, none of them are the same.
[07:04.160 --> 07:05.800]  Or him. They're all different.
[07:05.980 --> 07:08.320]  They do different things, and they don't overlap.
[07:08.420 --> 07:09.200]  It's awesome.
[07:09.560 --> 07:10.540]  It's an excellent point, Eric.
[07:10.920 --> 07:16.240]  What was the name of that James McAvoy movie where he had all the personalities or whatever, and he, like, fluctuated?
[07:16.720 --> 07:16.980]  Split?
[07:17.600 --> 07:18.000]  Split.
[07:18.040 --> 07:19.300]  Split? Yeah, that's what's right.
[07:19.300 --> 07:25.180]  You just imagine, like, the scene in Split where, like, he's cycling personalities, and it's like, oh, no, he's Whooptone.
[07:25.480 --> 07:26.800]  Just running down the halls.
[07:27.500 --> 07:28.180]  It's great.
[07:28.680 --> 07:30.220]  I'm a big fan of Whooptone.
[07:31.000 --> 07:37.900]  I gotta agree with you, Eric, because even looking at myself, like, if I take a harsh look inward, an honest look inward,
[07:38.540 --> 07:40.900]  T-Bone and Porterhouse are the exact same dude.
[07:41.620 --> 07:43.060]  There's no difference between those two guys.
[07:43.580 --> 07:47.200]  Well, I think he's T-Bone on the streets and Porterhouse in front of his girlfriend's parents.
[07:47.700 --> 07:48.060]  Oh!
[07:52.220 --> 07:54.820]  Even that is more of a differentiator.
[07:55.180 --> 07:57.060]  You're just a natural differentiator.
[07:57.220 --> 07:57.540]  That's the thing.
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.480]  You're adding personality to my non-personality nicknames.
[08:01.600 --> 08:02.020]  I love it.
[08:02.780 --> 08:04.480]  Suddenly, one of them's got a girlfriend.
[08:04.820 --> 08:06.080]  He's got a fucking new parents.
[08:08.480 --> 08:09.780]  Was Porterhouse a G.I. Joe?
[08:10.040 --> 08:11.460]  That feels like a G.I. Joe to me as well.
[08:12.260 --> 08:14.580]  It's too bad we didn't get to name all the G.I. Joes.
[08:15.340 --> 08:16.380]  How many are there?
[08:16.380 --> 08:17.360]  Like, ten?
[08:17.760 --> 08:18.860]  How many G.I. Joes, roughly?
[08:18.960 --> 08:19.980]  Oh, hundreds, hundreds.
[08:20.460 --> 08:20.920]  Really?
[08:21.700 --> 08:22.020]  Yeah.
[08:22.320 --> 08:23.540]  I know nothing about G.I. Joe.
[08:23.920 --> 08:25.360]  How many G.I. Joes were there?
[08:26.400 --> 08:28.180]  Porterhouse, not a G.I. Joe, sorry.
[08:28.400 --> 08:29.400]  Oh, that's disappointing.
[08:29.640 --> 08:30.340]  Was it a Decepticon?
[08:31.960 --> 08:33.260]  Hang on, hang on.
[08:33.860 --> 08:35.220]  No, not a Decepticon.
[08:35.720 --> 08:37.660]  I appreciate you fake looking that up, Eric.
[08:37.820 --> 08:39.220]  That was a nice timing.
[08:39.580 --> 08:43.000]  Here comes Star Screaming Porterhouse.
[08:43.000 --> 08:47.680]  This is so good.
[08:48.720 --> 08:49.580]  You know what?
[08:49.880 --> 08:50.400]  You know what?
[08:50.580 --> 08:51.780]  I'm really into Whoop Tone.
[08:51.980 --> 08:54.080]  Whoop Tone came in, big energy.
[08:54.680 --> 08:54.840]  Yeah.
[08:55.040 --> 08:55.860]  We're going all out.
[08:55.940 --> 08:57.700]  Whoop Tone's taking us to new heights.
[08:57.900 --> 08:58.160]  Can I?
[08:58.860 --> 09:01.400]  I want to see, you know, like a tag team wrestling match.
[09:01.640 --> 09:06.180]  Gavin, I want you to set up like your thrice to meet you and just tag in your different personalities.
[09:06.580 --> 09:08.640]  Oh, the ultimate tagging device.
[09:08.820 --> 09:09.060]  Yeah.
[09:09.300 --> 09:11.200]  It's like my personality switch.
[09:11.200 --> 09:13.220]  A fist bump in, a high five out.
[09:13.660 --> 09:14.140]  That's great.
[09:14.400 --> 09:16.800]  There's 163 G.I. Joes.
[09:17.000 --> 09:17.440]  Oh, wow.
[09:17.820 --> 09:19.400]  And none of them are named Porterhouse.
[09:20.240 --> 09:21.080]  Not so far.
[09:21.500 --> 09:22.360]  There's some good ones.
[09:22.960 --> 09:23.480]  Snowjob.
[09:23.880 --> 09:24.620]  That's a good one.
[09:26.000 --> 09:28.840]  That was just one called Barbecue.
[09:30.900 --> 09:34.500]  There should be one named Porterhouse if there's one named Barbecue.
[09:34.720 --> 09:36.480]  There's one called Crumbly Legs.
[09:37.260 --> 09:38.060]  That's me.
[09:38.180 --> 09:39.640]  That's me doing the sewing machine.
[09:40.280 --> 09:41.180]  We don't talk about that.
[09:41.680 --> 09:42.780]  Stretcher, he's a medic.
[09:43.740 --> 09:47.640]  I think we need to figure out our G.I. Joes that fit us best.
[09:48.200 --> 09:48.640]  Yeah.
[09:48.800 --> 09:50.460]  This is really...
[09:50.460 --> 09:53.440]  Oh, we should do... should we do a G.I. Joe draft?
[09:53.820 --> 09:55.020]  Oh, wow.
[09:55.820 --> 09:57.420]  We got 163 to choose from.
[09:57.420 --> 09:59.980]  That would be a real draft because it's not all of the earth.
[10:02.580 --> 10:03.280]  I don't know.
[10:03.360 --> 10:04.520]  The pool is false.
[10:05.720 --> 10:08.640]  It's no different than the G.I. Joes.
[10:08.840 --> 10:09.440]  Same thing.
[10:12.740 --> 10:16.080]  Are we doing 40 minutes of just listing every G.I. Joe name and then picking them?
[10:16.120 --> 10:16.480]  What do you want?
[10:17.040 --> 10:17.580]  What do we want?
[10:18.040 --> 10:20.460]  Well, we would read the list probably and then draft in.
[10:20.660 --> 10:20.880]  Why?
[10:21.220 --> 10:21.460]  Why?
[10:21.980 --> 10:22.780]  Why not just pick?
[10:23.320 --> 10:24.440]  We're killing time.
[10:24.620 --> 10:25.500]  It's a waste of time.
[10:26.280 --> 10:27.940]  Wait, why is that a waste of time?
[10:28.360 --> 10:32.640]  Why would we read 162 names and then pick 12 of them or 20 of them?
[10:32.840 --> 10:33.340]  Whatever it is.
[10:33.340 --> 10:35.780]  Why would we have to read 162 names?
[10:35.900 --> 10:37.120]  It's because of all the Joes.
[10:37.980 --> 10:42.660]  Well, that's like saying I didn't know more than 160 shops for my mall.
[10:42.840 --> 10:43.200]  What do you mean?
[10:43.840 --> 10:44.840]  I don't know what you're saying.
[10:47.480 --> 10:50.560]  I'm glad that the drafts have been cleared up and that this all makes sense now.
[10:50.640 --> 10:55.840]  How did you guys, you two specifically, when did you get off track communication-wise?
[10:56.040 --> 10:58.040]  You never seem to understand each other anymore.
[10:59.120 --> 11:00.360]  We stopped playing video games.
[11:00.460 --> 11:02.140]  Yeah, that's probably it.
[11:02.140 --> 11:03.060]  Can I ask you guys a favor?
[11:03.060 --> 11:08.640]  Can you guys play some fucking Halo together one night, just for like two hours, just to get back in sync?
[11:09.180 --> 11:11.420]  Yeah, but who's more out of sync? Him or me?
[11:11.800 --> 11:18.800]  I mean, you're fucking bumbling and clueless and he's aggressive and angry and it's just a bad...
[11:18.800 --> 11:21.860]  You guys are just butting up against each other right now.
[11:21.900 --> 11:23.400]  Alright, let's see if we can sort it out.
[11:24.080 --> 11:27.580]  I mean, I don't care if you don't because it's hilarious, but I'm just noticing it lately.
[11:28.960 --> 11:31.080]  You know, we have had some issues recently.
[11:31.080 --> 11:33.520]  I was complaining to Gavin about something and he called me dumb.
[11:33.600 --> 11:35.360]  And I thought he made a ridiculous comparison.
[11:37.100 --> 11:38.440]  You called him the D-word?
[11:38.680 --> 11:41.360]  You didn't call me dumb, but you called me dumb by your words.
[11:41.480 --> 11:44.720]  I didn't know that AirPods needed to be in the case to charge.
[11:44.840 --> 11:46.800]  That there's no other way to charge an AirPod.
[11:50.020 --> 11:51.440]  And I was mad about it.
[11:51.440 --> 11:53.380]  How the fuck else would you charge it?
[11:54.280 --> 11:54.600]  What do you mean?
[11:54.960 --> 11:56.220]  Do you want to plug it...
[11:56.860 --> 11:57.460]  Why couldn't I?
[11:57.480 --> 11:59.600]  USB plug would be like deeper than the pod.
[11:59.600 --> 12:03.180]  Why couldn't I? I got acres of white plastic that aren't doing nothing.
[12:03.420 --> 12:04.860]  Also, why did I call you dumb?
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.180]  I know I didn't call you dumb, but what about my words was dumb?
[12:11.960 --> 12:14.900]  The tone was more like, you're a fool for not knowing that.
[12:15.620 --> 12:18.160]  My response was, who gets AirPods without the case?
[12:18.980 --> 12:20.100]  Why would I have done that?
[12:20.840 --> 12:22.700]  First of all, I didn't get them at all. They were a gift.
[12:23.420 --> 12:24.180]  I did not buy the AirPods.
[12:25.020 --> 12:26.880]  That's why I didn't know they needed to be in the case.
[12:26.960 --> 12:28.000]  I thought that was just a bonus.
[12:28.000 --> 12:31.000]  Like my elite controller...
[12:33.580 --> 12:39.220]  My Xbox elite controller, you can charge it in the case, or you can just charge it with the cable outside of the case.
[12:40.040 --> 12:41.140]  But they're so small.
[12:41.960 --> 12:46.340]  But there's tons of... I'm telling you, there's a lot of white plastic real estate on that thing that's not being used.
[12:46.940 --> 12:52.600]  Yeah, I just feel like it wouldn't fit in your ear hole if there was a hole the depth of a USB plug in it.
[12:52.960 --> 12:53.540]  What do you mean?
[12:54.220 --> 12:55.660]  It would stick way further out of your ear.
[12:56.200 --> 12:57.220]  I don't think it would.
[12:58.500 --> 13:00.380]  Well, how deep is a USB plug?
[13:01.400 --> 13:03.360]  Well, deeper than not having one.
[13:04.320 --> 13:06.920]  Yeah, but I don't... I feel like it's a small cable.
[13:07.220 --> 13:10.100]  When you look at a USB cable, that's not like fucking six feet.
[13:10.520 --> 13:17.320]  We were arguing about this on text and I said, I was just like being an arsehole making other comparisons to where you need like another device.
[13:17.820 --> 13:20.740]  So I said, did you know you need a corkscrew to get the wine out of the bottle?
[13:21.120 --> 13:23.840]  A separate thing, the wine on its own, the wine bottle is useless.
[13:23.840 --> 13:28.280]  And Andrew said, yeah, but I don't need a specific corkscrew to open just that bottle.
[13:28.540 --> 13:33.260]  Then only be able to drink it out of a glass that they make.
[13:34.620 --> 13:35.660]  I was infuriated.
[13:35.700 --> 13:36.140]  He's got you there.
[13:36.680 --> 13:42.080]  I found my AirPods in a random like egg in an Easter egg case.
[13:42.480 --> 13:44.200]  And I was like, great, finally found them.
[13:44.400 --> 13:48.620]  Then I realized, oh no, I need the proper case to charge them.
[13:48.620 --> 13:55.040]  And then I was upset knowing that once I found the case, I would then need to find their special cable to charge all of it.
[13:55.140 --> 13:57.440]  Like each part was just ridiculous.
[13:57.620 --> 13:58.000]  It was absurd.
[13:58.500 --> 14:06.240]  I got to say, as a longtime AirPod user, my AirPods, if they're not in my ears, they're instantly back in the case.
[14:06.320 --> 14:07.020]  That's where they live.
[14:07.120 --> 14:09.040]  That's where they they're happiest in the case.
[14:09.400 --> 14:11.880]  They don't want to be out outside of the case.
[14:12.220 --> 14:12.580]  That's fair.
[14:12.660 --> 14:16.540]  I mean, this only became a problem because phones decided to take away the headphone jack.
[14:17.280 --> 14:18.240]  Yeah, it's a dumb move.
[14:18.240 --> 14:19.740]  That is a dumb, dumb move.
[14:19.960 --> 14:20.660]  No argument there.
[14:20.680 --> 14:24.240]  It's still all that courage and all those years later is still really annoying.
[14:24.680 --> 14:26.200]  Yeah, it's fucking stupid.
[14:26.300 --> 14:26.980]  You're right about that.
[14:27.300 --> 14:28.180]  Just a quick question.
[14:28.640 --> 14:31.500]  You found your case in an Easter egg?
[14:31.780 --> 14:32.320]  Yeah, I don't know.
[14:32.440 --> 14:33.540]  I don't know why they were in there.
[14:33.660 --> 14:34.520]  I don't know why I had it.
[14:34.580 --> 14:36.840]  It was in my, it was in my end table.
[14:36.960 --> 14:38.220]  It's just the Easter egg shell.
[14:38.900 --> 14:40.440]  It's a plastic Easter egg thing.
[14:40.500 --> 14:41.200]  I popped open.
[14:41.280 --> 14:42.280]  I was like, oh my God, AirPods.
[14:42.680 --> 14:44.960]  Do you think you were like, I don't know, maybe this will charge them.
[14:48.980 --> 14:50.300]  No, no, no.
[14:51.060 --> 14:52.400]  That didn't cross your mind.
[14:52.640 --> 14:55.080]  You're like, you were like, you were like the Easter.
[14:55.260 --> 14:57.120]  The Easter egg is plastic too, right?
[14:57.740 --> 14:58.740]  Let me recharge this.
[14:58.920 --> 15:01.640]  The magic bunny brought it and it's gotta work.
[15:05.400 --> 15:10.280]  Now I think realistically, I had my charger on the other side of the room from where that end table is.
[15:10.700 --> 15:14.220]  And I probably just took them off and was like, I don't want to lose these.
[15:14.220 --> 15:16.140]  So I'll just put them in this case.
[15:16.840 --> 15:19.320]  Do you keep a lot of Easter eggs around?
[15:19.660 --> 15:21.060]  That's the only egg I have.
[15:21.520 --> 15:22.780]  What color is it?
[15:22.900 --> 15:23.440]  It was white.
[15:23.840 --> 15:24.420]  It was a white egg.
[15:25.040 --> 15:27.580]  Oh, so you must have barely seen them in there.
[15:30.380 --> 15:31.280]  Double back.
[15:31.780 --> 15:33.180]  It's the confusion, yeah.
[15:33.480 --> 15:33.960]  Yeah.
[15:35.520 --> 15:35.740]  Yeah.
[15:36.500 --> 15:38.800]  Nick says, new product idea, Easter egg charger.
[15:39.380 --> 15:40.040]  I love it.
[15:41.780 --> 15:45.380]  I don't know that I've ever seen like a white decorative Easter egg.
[15:45.480 --> 15:47.920]  Aren't they typically like yellow or blue or something?
[15:48.340 --> 15:50.080]  Did you have a picture of how you found them?
[15:50.140 --> 15:51.780]  Like, could you recreate the situation?
[15:52.180 --> 15:58.960]  I was going through my end table and I was just pulling out stuff.
[15:59.140 --> 16:00.420]  There was some plastic.
[16:01.140 --> 16:02.680]  It was a plastic egg.
[16:03.300 --> 16:05.420]  So you couldn't find your case.
[16:05.420 --> 16:12.000]  Your AirPods were loose and your case was inside a white Easter egg in an end table.
[16:12.000 --> 16:13.500]  No, no, the case wasn't.
[16:13.820 --> 16:15.100]  The case was in my desk.
[16:15.500 --> 16:18.520]  I found that later in my sauce drawer of my desk.
[16:18.580 --> 16:19.960]  What is going on?
[16:23.300 --> 16:24.980]  It's a real Charlie Kelly vibe here.
[16:24.980 --> 16:28.940]  So I found the AirPods in my bedside table.
[16:29.260 --> 16:30.460]  That's the first place I looked.
[16:30.560 --> 16:31.580]  I figured they might be in there.
[16:32.040 --> 16:33.740]  Found them in the egg case.
[16:33.740 --> 16:35.740]  So the pods themselves were in the egg?
[16:36.000 --> 16:36.820]  The pods, yes.
[16:36.940 --> 16:39.080]  Just the pods were in the case, in the egg case.
[16:39.280 --> 16:43.140]  Then I had to try to find the proper case, which I found in my sauce drawer.
[16:43.760 --> 16:46.420]  I still have not found the special cable to charge all of.
[16:46.940 --> 16:51.980]  Did you just wake up bleary eyed in the night and you were just like, without turning the light on,
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.260]  trying to put your AirPods in the case, but you accidentally put them in the egg?
[16:56.540 --> 16:58.420]  I still don't understand how this happened.
[16:58.620 --> 17:03.380]  So the case, the last time I remember using the case, it was on the other side of the room.
[17:03.380 --> 17:04.760]  The far side.
[17:05.300 --> 17:07.600]  So I think I probably was laying in bed.
[17:08.060 --> 17:11.540]  I've actually, yeah, that's absolutely, I would have been laying in bed using them.
[17:12.600 --> 17:14.880]  Realized maybe they died or I was just like, I'm done.
[17:15.100 --> 17:16.800]  I don't want to misplace these.
[17:16.900 --> 17:18.640]  I'll put them in the egg, I guess.
[17:20.220 --> 17:21.800]  And I never used them.
[17:22.060 --> 17:25.320]  This is probably like a year and a half, two years ago was the last time I used AirPods.
[17:25.920 --> 17:27.800]  So, so, so wait a minute.
[17:27.940 --> 17:34.000]  So for a year and a half to two years, you've just had a plastic Easter egg floating around your, your room?
[17:34.300 --> 17:35.720]  Yeah, well, not my room.
[17:35.800 --> 17:38.860]  It's not even from this Easter?
[17:39.520 --> 17:39.820]  No.
[17:40.280 --> 17:44.980]  So you managed, the AirPods consist of three components, right?
[17:45.020 --> 17:48.320]  If we, if we consider the AirPods themselves to be a unit, then you've got the AirPods,
[17:48.500 --> 17:51.100]  you've got the charger and you've got the case.
[17:51.100 --> 17:55.980]  You manage in one room to spread those three components to the wind.
[17:56.280 --> 18:02.180]  And now they're like, how did you lose them all so far away from each other in such a small space?
[18:02.540 --> 18:07.480]  It's like a lazy plot video game where you have to collect the three things from the far corners of the...
[18:09.120 --> 18:10.380]  That's the next video game.
[18:10.420 --> 18:12.920]  Help Andrew recompile his AirPods.
[18:12.940 --> 18:13.500]  Oh, I'd love it.
[18:13.720 --> 18:17.560]  If anyone can give some assistance on where this cable is, I'd appreciate it.
[18:18.020 --> 18:19.680]  I've kind of given up hope of finding it.
[18:19.680 --> 18:21.460]  Plus, was it just a lightning cable?
[18:21.800 --> 18:23.100]  I assume so. I don't know.
[18:24.800 --> 18:31.440]  You guys ever see those Japanese CGI, like dramatic reenactments of crimes, crime scenes?
[18:31.660 --> 18:37.100]  I feel like we need one of those for you trying to find, for you to go through that story you just explained to us.
[18:37.460 --> 18:43.060]  Yeah, I wish you could have felt my anger when I got Gavin's text about wine bottles.
[18:43.480 --> 18:44.900]  Like, you fucking idiot.
[18:45.720 --> 18:48.800]  Well, yeah, a lot of the time you need other shit for your shit.
[18:48.980 --> 18:49.480]  Otherwise it doesn't work.
[18:49.860 --> 18:51.500]  I'm not saying it's great. It's pretty annoying.
[18:52.020 --> 18:54.520]  I have nothing to say. Nothing to say to that.
[18:54.600 --> 18:56.840]  I feel like I countered what you said at the time.
[18:57.160 --> 18:57.860]  You're not wrong.
[18:58.300 --> 18:59.960]  There's just a lot of real estate in those things.
[19:01.580 --> 19:02.460]  That's all I'm saying.
[19:03.800 --> 19:07.620]  If we're talking about products that we've made, can I talk about a thing that I made recently?
[19:08.100 --> 19:08.440]  Please.
[19:08.700 --> 19:09.820]  That might inspire the two of you.
[19:09.840 --> 19:11.740]  I've been talking about this with you guys for a while.
[19:11.740 --> 19:15.060]  But in two days from now, it'll be much past that point.
[19:15.100 --> 19:16.140]  It is our show's birthday.
[19:16.460 --> 19:23.340]  And I thought it would be a fun idea as like a supplemental thing is if we all made a cake, like a birthday cake.
[19:23.340 --> 19:24.980]  Because I had never attempted to make one before.
[19:25.300 --> 19:29.180]  And then we did like the regulation birthday cake was the idea.
[19:29.260 --> 19:30.580]  We could all present what we made.
[19:30.840 --> 19:31.860]  Sort of the thought.
[19:32.900 --> 19:36.200]  So I made a cake that I'm very proud of.
[19:36.420 --> 19:37.780]  I've never made a cake before.
[19:38.340 --> 19:41.360]  Now saying I made a cake maybe is a little bit of a strong word.
[19:41.360 --> 19:43.180]  But I had a lot of assistance in making this cake.
[19:43.320 --> 19:52.780]  I would say as much work as Steve Jobs did in like making the iPhone is the amount of contribution I made with this cake.
[19:53.120 --> 19:54.940]  It's a masterful thing.
[19:55.280 --> 19:57.100]  I think this is an innovation.
[19:57.200 --> 19:58.540]  I think I'm an innovator in the space.
[19:58.900 --> 20:02.080]  I think these would sell out day one if we were to mass produce them.
[20:02.140 --> 20:03.400]  So it's important, first of all.
[20:03.680 --> 20:04.120]  Ingredients.
[20:04.380 --> 20:05.480]  Gotta show your ingredients.
[20:05.660 --> 20:07.020]  We got some orange juice.
[20:07.040 --> 20:08.180]  We got some flour.
[20:09.040 --> 20:09.480]  Lemon.
[20:10.700 --> 20:11.160]  Sugar.
[20:11.780 --> 20:13.500]  The basis of all good cakes.
[20:13.820 --> 20:18.180]  Geoff, if I showed you these ingredients lined up like this, would you go, birthday cake, clearly?
[20:20.400 --> 20:21.680]  I might not.
[20:22.240 --> 20:23.340]  If I'm being honest.
[20:23.740 --> 20:24.040]  Really?
[20:24.300 --> 20:25.280]  Why is so much of it brown?
[20:25.420 --> 20:26.500]  What's all the brown shit?
[20:26.940 --> 20:27.680]  What, on the right?
[20:27.820 --> 20:28.520]  The brown stuff?
[20:28.700 --> 20:29.820]  That's brown sugar.
[20:30.320 --> 20:30.600]  Okay.
[20:31.020 --> 20:33.660]  What's the brown with the jar with the red top?
[20:34.020 --> 20:35.020]  Brown with the red top.
[20:35.100 --> 20:36.320]  Is that ginger, was I saying?
[20:36.760 --> 20:37.900]  Yeah, some ginger.
[20:38.160 --> 20:38.980]  You know what it is.
[20:40.180 --> 20:41.380]  You know what it is.
[20:41.380 --> 20:41.820]  You shut up.
[20:43.500 --> 20:47.460]  And what's the sort of porcelain horse in the background?
[20:47.900 --> 20:49.060]  Is the horse a part of the cake?
[20:49.640 --> 20:51.220]  No, it's a cosmetic thing, unfortunately.
[20:51.380 --> 20:52.160]  Is it porcelain?
[20:53.020 --> 20:53.740]  I don't know.
[20:54.080 --> 20:56.160]  I'm not, I think, qualified to answer that.
[20:56.740 --> 20:59.460]  I don't think I could tell you if the thing was porcelain or not just by feel.
[21:00.180 --> 21:01.820]  I wouldn't trust my porcelain judgment.
[21:02.520 --> 21:04.660]  So it was an apple cake, because I feel like that's important.
[21:04.780 --> 21:05.920]  That's the key part of the show.
[21:06.260 --> 21:06.620]  Okay.
[21:07.540 --> 21:07.920]  Porcelain.
[21:11.400 --> 21:12.500]  You gotta mix it with the batter.
[21:12.780 --> 21:13.960]  You gotta add a lot of apples in there, right?
[21:14.460 --> 21:15.920]  I just did another podcast with Eric earlier.
[21:16.220 --> 21:17.240]  He's on fire today.
[21:17.740 --> 21:21.820]  Hey, Geoff, if I showed you this picture, would you look at that and go...
[21:22.840 --> 21:25.240]  Now it looks like somebody threw up spaghetti.
[21:26.360 --> 21:27.420]  Really? You think spaghetti?
[21:28.200 --> 21:31.720]  Yeah, I think like a little bit of, a little like rigatoni puke.
[21:32.740 --> 21:36.320]  Oh, no, that's a delicious...
[21:36.320 --> 21:38.140]  We got some cosmic crisp apple in there.
[21:38.280 --> 21:39.700]  We got some Granny Smith.
[21:40.080 --> 21:41.020]  Got a good mix of theirs.
[21:41.180 --> 21:42.520]  This is making a delicious apple cake.
[21:42.520 --> 21:43.080]  A multi-apple.
[21:43.580 --> 21:43.880]  Yeah.
[21:44.740 --> 21:45.600]  Threw it all together.
[21:45.840 --> 21:46.580]  You know, we made it.
[21:46.600 --> 21:47.240]  And this is my cake.
[21:47.320 --> 21:50.980]  I want to introduce to you the Regulation Cake.
[21:51.300 --> 21:51.800]  Look at that.
[21:52.380 --> 21:52.740]  Whoa.
[21:53.480 --> 21:53.840]  Wow.
[21:55.340 --> 21:55.760]  Look at that.
[21:55.760 --> 21:56.540]  Looks like a pie.
[21:56.800 --> 21:57.440]  It's a pie?
[21:57.960 --> 21:58.160]  What?
[21:58.240 --> 21:58.820]  You made a pie?
[21:58.960 --> 21:59.420]  Is it a pie?
[21:59.420 --> 22:00.260]  That's gorgeous.
[22:00.900 --> 22:02.280]  That's a Regulation f*** face pie.
[22:02.680 --> 22:03.260]  No, it's a cake.
[22:03.380 --> 22:04.120]  It's clearly a cake.
[22:04.680 --> 22:05.140]  What do you mean?
[22:05.140 --> 22:06.040]  Is that?
[22:06.840 --> 22:08.540]  It looks, Andrew, it looks fancy.
[22:08.620 --> 22:09.500]  I'm very impressed.
[22:09.660 --> 22:10.520]  It looks really great.
[22:10.600 --> 22:12.240]  The text looks amazing.
[22:12.400 --> 22:13.560]  Yeah, it really does.
[22:13.640 --> 22:14.260]  I'm blown away.
[22:14.420 --> 22:16.940]  This is, like, the amount of effort you put into this is so cool.
[22:17.220 --> 22:18.080]  You made a pie?
[22:18.940 --> 22:20.080]  I assume Bailey touched it.
[22:20.260 --> 22:21.080]  Did you touch this?
[22:21.480 --> 22:23.000]  I came up with the premise of this.
[22:23.080 --> 22:23.820]  Okay, alright.
[22:24.040 --> 22:25.480]  Okay, okay, never mind.
[22:26.060 --> 22:27.940]  Phenomenal font work for whoever did it.
[22:28.180 --> 22:28.380]  Yeah.
[22:28.380 --> 22:30.560]  Does the cake get frosting at any point?
[22:31.060 --> 22:32.000]  No, it doesn't need it.
[22:32.060 --> 22:32.500]  It's perfect.
[22:32.660 --> 22:33.400]  It's perfect as is.
[22:33.480 --> 22:34.020]  It's a delicious cake.
[22:34.020 --> 22:34.740]  Huh.
[22:35.000 --> 22:35.860]  You guys don't like this cake?
[22:36.040 --> 22:37.920]  I really, I was going to say that the text...
[22:37.920 --> 22:39.140]  You fools!
[22:39.660 --> 22:40.760]  You think it's a pie?
[22:40.920 --> 22:41.140]  Okay.
[22:41.440 --> 22:42.260]  It is not a pie.
[22:42.680 --> 22:43.580]  It is a cake.
[22:43.700 --> 22:43.960]  Right.
[22:44.420 --> 22:45.200]  In a pie.
[22:45.740 --> 22:47.280]  Oh, you put cake in a pie crust?
[22:47.440 --> 22:49.920]  I put cake in a pie crust because I'm a pie guy.
[22:50.300 --> 22:50.320]  Wow!
[22:50.500 --> 22:53.820]  I prefer the pie crust more than the cake.
[22:54.060 --> 22:55.400]  So this is it before it's done.
[22:55.640 --> 23:01.220]  See, you make, you get the pie crust, you make the cake, you put the cake in the pie crust,
[23:01.220 --> 23:03.840]  then you seal it up all nice and, it's like a tomb.
[23:04.440 --> 23:05.100]  Seal it in like a mummy.
[23:05.620 --> 23:07.060]  Got yourself a delicious fucking pie cake.
[23:07.540 --> 23:09.120]  You've like turduckened dessert.
[23:09.720 --> 23:12.320]  I've turduckened dessert and it is fucking delicious.
[23:12.680 --> 23:13.520]  It looks good.
[23:13.840 --> 23:13.960]  It is so goddamn good.
[23:13.980 --> 23:14.520]  I would eat that.
[23:14.700 --> 23:15.600]  Can I ask a question?
[23:15.960 --> 23:16.440]  Yeah, go ahead.
[23:16.880 --> 23:18.680]  Has anybody, did you just invent this?
[23:18.960 --> 23:19.480]  I did.
[23:19.720 --> 23:21.920]  I looked at, well, I'm, maybe, I don't know.
[23:22.080 --> 23:23.240]  I said that very confidently.
[23:23.660 --> 23:27.360]  I searched online and I couldn't find anything, anywhere, that did this.
[23:27.440 --> 23:28.180]  So what is it?
[23:28.240 --> 23:29.180]  Like a, a, a cake?
[23:29.460 --> 23:29.980]  It's a cake.
[23:29.980 --> 23:30.460]  Exactly.
[23:30.660 --> 23:32.000]  It's the regulation cake.
[23:33.840 --> 23:34.680]  Regulation cake.
[23:35.140 --> 23:37.220]  So here's, there were two of them, right?
[23:37.740 --> 23:41.000]  I came up with this idea and I was like, this is going to be awful.
[23:41.200 --> 23:43.500]  But you guys are going to be like, that's a fucking pie.
[23:43.620 --> 23:45.020]  Then I'll be like, oh, look inside.
[23:45.540 --> 23:47.360]  It's actually a cake in a pie.
[23:47.980 --> 23:48.840]  You'd never see it.
[23:49.860 --> 23:54.240]  Um, so there's just a normal version of it without, without the shell.
[23:54.440 --> 23:55.360]  And that was pretty good.
[23:55.480 --> 23:56.460]  That was like a really good cake.
[23:56.460 --> 23:58.160]  Then I tried the pig.
[23:58.880 --> 24:00.480]  Best dessert I've ever had.
[24:00.760 --> 24:01.080]  Whoa.
[24:01.800 --> 24:02.180]  Wow.
[24:02.180 --> 24:05.220]  I think keeping it in the pie crust, it made it so moist.
[24:05.620 --> 24:06.580]  It was fantastic.
[24:07.040 --> 24:09.320]  There's some stuff you need to innovate a little bit on it.
[24:09.380 --> 24:11.380]  The bottom of the pie crust, not fully cooked.
[24:11.740 --> 24:13.420]  Need to, need to time it a little bit better.
[24:13.700 --> 24:14.700]  As far as that goes.
[24:15.180 --> 24:16.220]  But I'm very proud of this.
[24:16.380 --> 24:17.940]  Now we have to make a second cookbook.
[24:18.140 --> 24:18.540]  Okay.
[24:18.760 --> 24:20.960]  So, done, I've done a little bit of research.
[24:21.400 --> 24:25.580]  And Andrew, I will say, what you've done is different, because people are going to tweet this.
[24:25.580 --> 24:26.880]  People are going to be like, you didn't invent it.
[24:26.880 --> 24:27.440]  You didn't invent it.
[24:27.460 --> 24:29.140]  Here's the, here's the pie cake-in.
[24:29.500 --> 24:30.860]  Here's what, here's what I will posit.
[24:31.000 --> 24:32.100]  Andrew, here's how yours is different.
[24:32.260 --> 24:33.780]  Yours is a cake inside of a pie crust.
[24:34.120 --> 24:35.940]  What you've done is you are turducken.
[24:36.320 --> 24:39.840]  This is two separate pies inside of cake icing.
[24:40.180 --> 24:41.380]  Yeah, there's frosting and stuff.
[24:41.620 --> 24:41.760]  Yeah.
[24:41.760 --> 24:43.580]  You've done something totally different from this.
[24:43.720 --> 24:43.760]  Yeah.
[24:43.840 --> 24:47.920]  So, before people send this, and it's, they're still going to do it.
[24:48.180 --> 24:51.380]  I'm just letting you know, you, sir, you're an inventor.
[24:51.720 --> 24:52.640]  And I'm proud of you.
[24:52.980 --> 24:55.060]  As I said, that's, that's brilliant.
[24:55.600 --> 24:57.840]  Steve Jobs of, of cake right here.
[24:57.880 --> 24:58.500]  That's what I am.
[24:58.500 --> 25:00.780]  You are a true visionary, Andrew.
[25:01.300 --> 25:01.700]  Congratulations.
[25:02.020 --> 25:03.740]  I am very, very excited.
[25:03.740 --> 25:06.180]  You know, the best part is, it's, it's the regulation cake.
[25:06.340 --> 25:08.180]  And then when you get halfway through, it's a fuck cake.
[25:08.740 --> 25:09.360]  It's great.
[25:11.160 --> 25:12.400]  We have a lot of fun with that.
[25:15.920 --> 25:17.200]  I'll put the recipe together.
[25:18.040 --> 25:19.520]  I'm still tweaking it a little bit.
[25:19.940 --> 25:22.300]  I can get it, I can get it into the cookbook.
[25:22.340 --> 25:22.960]  We still got time.
[25:22.960 --> 25:27.880]  When I was looking at it before I knew the cake was in the pie, I was about to say that
[25:27.880 --> 25:29.940]  the, the text was really icing on the cake.
[25:30.100 --> 25:33.920]  And then I realized you can't say that when it's literally a cake and there's no icing.
[25:36.660 --> 25:38.920]  And I was like, oh, but it's like the cherry on top.
[25:39.040 --> 25:39.380]  I was like, nope.
[25:42.120 --> 25:45.540]  Why is like extra mild shit always cake based?
[25:45.820 --> 25:50.980]  Like, is, is the icing on the cake, is the cherry on top better than the icing on the
[25:50.980 --> 25:51.220]  cake?
[25:51.620 --> 25:52.680]  Or are they both the same?
[25:53.400 --> 25:55.820]  Uh, use them both in a sentence, please.
[25:56.420 --> 25:58.460]  Oh, you know, like, that's just the cherry on top.
[25:58.500 --> 25:58.820]  Okay.
[25:59.100 --> 25:59.840]  What's the other sentence?
[26:00.080 --> 26:00.640]  Oh, yeah.
[26:00.740 --> 26:02.920]  You know, that's icing on the cake.
[26:04.880 --> 26:06.420]  I don't know that those...
[26:06.420 --> 26:06.500]  Okay.
[26:06.800 --> 26:07.500]  I don't like it.
[26:07.540 --> 26:07.720]  Yeah.
[26:08.460 --> 26:10.100]  I think they're the exact same thing.
[26:11.120 --> 26:11.300]  Yeah.
[26:11.400 --> 26:12.620]  I think they're interchangeable.
[26:12.880 --> 26:14.400]  What about when something takes the cake?
[26:14.480 --> 26:16.120]  Does that help you one way or the other?
[26:17.680 --> 26:20.260]  It depends on if the cake has icing or a cherry on it.
[26:20.260 --> 26:20.460]  Yeah.
[26:24.400 --> 26:25.420]  Who took the cake?
[26:25.640 --> 26:26.120]  Whooptone!
[26:26.520 --> 26:28.040]  Whooptone did, I can hear his feet.

[27:45.010 --> 27:48.990]  Cold turkey may be great on sandwiches, but there's a better way to break your bad habits.
[27:49.190 --> 27:52.150]  And I'm not talking some weird ice tack cure thing.
[27:52.430 --> 27:53.330]  I don't know if you get those.
[27:53.450 --> 27:58.670]  Almost all of the fake products I get advertised are weirdly connected to ice being the basis of it.
[27:59.150 --> 28:00.710]  We're not talking about that nonsense, though.
[28:00.770 --> 28:05.570]  We're talking about our sponsor, Fume, and how they look at the problem in a different way.
[28:06.030 --> 28:07.470]  Not everything in a bad habit is wrong.
[28:07.550 --> 28:12.610]  So instead of a drastic, uncomfortable change, why not just remove the bad from your habit?

[28:16.790 --> 28:19.630]  Instead of electronics, Fume is completely natural.
[28:20.090 --> 28:22.410]  Instead of vapor, Fume uses flavored air.

[28:45.210 --> 28:47.970]  Something I was struck by when I saw Fume is just the look of it.
[28:48.070 --> 28:50.390]  It's beautiful real wood and the shape is just awesome.
[28:50.550 --> 28:51.350]  It looks so cool.
[28:51.970 --> 28:54.030]  It's something you would definitely feel cool using.

[29:26.050 --> 29:32.950]  Hey everyone, we wanted to take a moment to remind you that RTX 2023 is happening this July 7th through July 9th.
[29:32.950 --> 29:37.050]  Join us this summer for a memorable weekend at our Camp for Indoor Kids.
[29:37.450 --> 29:44.190]  Featuring 15 plus live shows, special meet and greets, exclusive parties, fun panels, and much more.
[29:44.570 --> 29:48.250]  With guests ranging from your favorite RT groups like Funhaus and Achievement Hunter,
[29:48.710 --> 29:53.270]  to friends like Therapy Gecko, the Super Carlin Bros, and new rock stars.
[29:53.750 --> 29:56.430]  RTX 2023 is an event you won't want to miss.
[29:56.890 --> 30:00.170]  Badges for this three-day funfest are available for as low as $55.
[30:00.170 --> 30:03.690]  Thanks for listening to us get very excited about RTX.
[30:03.970 --> 30:05.930]  We're looking forward to meeting all of you there.
[30:06.310 --> 30:11.230]  So head on over to rtxaustin.com to get more information about the event and buy your badge.
[30:11.750 --> 30:13.750]  It kills me that I'm not going to be at the show this year.
[30:13.870 --> 30:15.730]  Everything I've heard about it sounds so amazing.
[30:16.170 --> 30:17.390]  It's going to be such a great time.
[30:17.890 --> 30:19.110]  So definitely check it out.
[30:21.130 --> 30:23.110]  What kind of cake does Wiptone like?
[30:23.530 --> 30:24.510]  What's Wiptone's dessert?
[30:25.370 --> 30:26.430]  Oh, that's a big question.
[30:26.430 --> 30:27.410]  What's he going to be liking?
[30:28.310 --> 30:30.030]  Maybe something with strawberry on the inside.
[30:30.690 --> 30:31.370]  Some sort of glaze.
[30:32.010 --> 30:33.970]  I'm immediately picturing a red glaze.
[30:34.570 --> 30:37.770]  He likes like a jelly-filled, like Wiptone likes like, yeah, okay.
[30:38.290 --> 30:38.950]  Yeah, something like that.
[30:39.710 --> 30:41.270]  That is an amazing invention.
[30:41.830 --> 30:42.450]  Yeah, congratulations.
[30:43.050 --> 30:43.430]  Thank you.
[30:43.870 --> 30:45.710]  Can I ask what kind of cake Gavin likes?
[30:45.890 --> 30:46.730]  Is that, is it different?
[30:46.930 --> 30:48.630]  I like a good Colin the Caterpillar.
[30:49.350 --> 30:49.750]  What?
[30:50.170 --> 30:53.250]  Oh, it's probably like a Fudgie the Whale, I'm assuming.
[30:54.650 --> 30:58.230]  It's a Fudgie the Whale, but the weird version overseas.
[30:58.470 --> 30:59.430]  I'm getting you an image.
[30:59.850 --> 31:04.370]  I feel like I've been asking a lot of questions this episode, but it has been paying off dividends.
[31:04.650 --> 31:06.510]  So I really, I don't feel too, too bad.
[31:07.150 --> 31:09.750]  What the, what the fuck is Colin the Caterpillar?
[31:11.230 --> 31:13.810]  Did he say Colin the Caterpillar?
[31:14.190 --> 31:14.470]  Colin.
[31:14.850 --> 31:15.330]  Colin.
[31:15.710 --> 31:17.010]  Colin the Caterpillar?
[31:17.150 --> 31:17.490]  Colin the Caterpillar.
[31:17.490 --> 31:17.930]  Oh.
[31:21.250 --> 31:24.670]  It's a, it's a cake that looks like a caterpillar.
[31:24.790 --> 31:25.970]  We should have expected this.
[31:26.050 --> 31:28.150]  It's like a Fudgie the Whale type thing.
[31:28.330 --> 31:32.410]  Yeah, sometimes you have little Smarties or M&M's on top and it's like a chocolate swirl cake.
[31:34.170 --> 31:36.110]  I'm definitely sufficiently whelmed.
[31:36.290 --> 31:39.230]  This is sort of like, not really what I was expecting, but...
[31:39.230 --> 31:39.630]  You're disappointed?
[31:40.110 --> 31:41.730]  I'm not disappointed.
[31:41.890 --> 31:43.370]  It just kind of is, you know what I mean?
[31:43.890 --> 31:44.830]  Just kind of, yeah.
[31:45.270 --> 31:46.410]  Where can I get one?
[31:47.170 --> 31:48.810]  Oh, you can bring out Cookie Puss again.
[31:49.050 --> 31:50.750]  It's Cookie Puss, yeah.
[31:52.010 --> 31:53.950]  It's hard to beat Cookie Puss' hands.
[31:54.550 --> 31:55.710]  They're fucking crooked.
[31:59.250 --> 32:01.450]  Oh, those are, those are hands.
[32:01.910 --> 32:02.310]  Oh!
[32:04.490 --> 32:05.290]  That never...
[32:05.290 --> 32:07.430]  That's been making me laugh my entire life.
[32:07.570 --> 32:09.030]  It's like his hands go down to his mustache.
[32:10.090 --> 32:14.390]  He can like, he can like use his hands to make his jaw chew if he gets, if his mouth gets tired.
[32:15.570 --> 32:18.150]  Where do you get a Colin the Caterpillar? Can I get that in America?
[32:18.670 --> 32:20.630]  Uh, well this one, I posted this from M&S.
[32:20.930 --> 32:21.750]  Marks and Spencer.
[32:22.210 --> 32:23.450]  I'm gonna guess that's not an American place.
[32:23.570 --> 32:24.030]  Can you import it?
[32:24.030 --> 32:25.190]  No, I don't know if I could.
[32:26.030 --> 32:27.550]  Yeah, let's import one.
[32:28.550 --> 32:29.230]  Sneak one over?
[32:29.430 --> 32:31.050]  We'll have that and a Cookie Puss.
[32:31.390 --> 32:34.250]  The Cookie Puss, what's great about that is maybe you get an arm.
[32:34.570 --> 32:35.690]  Maybe somebody gets a mouth.
[32:36.050 --> 32:39.390]  Somebody gets a, like, there's different sections of character you could get.
[32:39.770 --> 32:43.870]  Unless you get the head of your Colin the Caterpillar, whatever the fuck.
[32:43.870 --> 32:45.810]  Like, it's just, it's not, it doesn't look like anything.
[32:46.130 --> 32:47.390]  It's just circular cake.
[32:47.790 --> 32:49.990]  Well, let me show you a cross section.
[32:50.190 --> 32:51.470]  It's good shit, I'm telling you.
[32:51.910 --> 32:52.810]  Show me a cross section.
[32:53.090 --> 32:54.250]  What does this cross section look like?
[32:55.010 --> 32:56.150]  No, it's just cake.
[32:56.350 --> 32:57.190]  It just looks like cake.
[32:57.510 --> 33:00.170]  It looks fucking delicious to me, dude.
[33:00.250 --> 33:01.130]  It does look delicious.
[33:01.510 --> 33:06.390]  But I'm saying the fun, the fun of a character cake is you get different parts of the character.
[33:06.910 --> 33:10.150]  Yeah, you get his front arms or his middle arms or his back arms.
[33:11.950 --> 33:14.450]  It doesn't even look like every section has limbs.
[33:14.850 --> 33:18.290]  So, like, only half the people get part of the caterpillar.
[33:18.630 --> 33:23.910]  Yeah, but if you don't get, if you don't get the limb, you might get the diamond or the fucking crown on top.
[33:24.550 --> 33:27.510]  Are there, are there baby Colin the Caterpillars?
[33:27.610 --> 33:28.390]  What's going on in the background?
[33:28.390 --> 33:29.170]  Yeah, that's quite disturbing.
[33:29.350 --> 33:31.290]  I never had one with, like, little slug kids.
[33:31.570 --> 33:35.810]  But, yeah, I guess you could eat, you could just pop an entire child in your mouth.
[33:36.590 --> 33:39.930]  Is Colin their royalty? It's the royal family of cakes?
[33:40.650 --> 33:42.070]  It looks like they're wearing a crown.
[33:42.530 --> 33:43.110]  Oh, yeah.
[33:43.570 --> 33:44.110]  Part of the body.
[33:44.110 --> 33:44.530]  That could be King Colin.
[33:45.950 --> 33:47.630]  He's also got crowns on his back.
[33:47.890 --> 33:49.310]  Yeah, I don't know, I never had one that looked like that.
[33:52.150 --> 33:56.230]  Eric, would you say Big Dog or Gooch Pooch? Is he, is he into the cookie puss?
[33:56.590 --> 33:58.970]  Uh, yeah, I think he's, but that's the thing. So am I.
[33:59.070 --> 34:00.910]  Like, that's where I'm making, like, the differentiation.
[34:01.250 --> 34:03.270]  It's hard for me to be an alter ego.
[34:03.370 --> 34:04.890]  I'm just kind of me the whole time.
[34:04.890 --> 34:07.050]  And you have...
[34:07.050 --> 34:10.710]  When I asked what Gavin likes, I didn't think Colin the Caterpillar.
[34:11.990 --> 34:13.690]  Colin the Caterpillar was the answer.
[34:14.570 --> 34:17.710]  It was weird that Gavin's answer was weirder than his character's answer.
[34:17.750 --> 34:18.710]  Yeah, I will agree with that.
[34:18.710 --> 34:19.170]  That's the strange thing.
[34:22.390 --> 34:23.970]  I wouldn't have expected that.
[34:24.510 --> 34:26.770]  Oh, man, I really want to eat one of these fucking caterpillars.
[34:26.810 --> 34:28.110]  I'm going to have to go to England to do it.
[34:28.390 --> 34:29.150]  Uh, well, let's go.
[34:29.510 --> 34:31.330]  How much of the caterpillar could you eat?
[34:31.810 --> 34:31.970]  Oh.
[34:32.070 --> 34:33.210]  Could you eat one whole Colin?
[34:33.630 --> 34:34.330]  Oh, definitely not.
[34:34.330 --> 34:35.690]  You'd hurl.
[34:36.010 --> 34:36.890]  Very rich.
[34:37.030 --> 34:39.090]  I could eat half a Colin.
[34:39.810 --> 34:41.010]  I could eat the face side.
[34:41.150 --> 34:42.050]  I could eat the face half.
[34:42.330 --> 34:43.290]  Oh, my God.
[34:43.550 --> 34:43.930]  I've...
[34:43.930 --> 34:44.970]  I've just...
[34:44.970 --> 34:46.330]  I've just found a picture.
[34:46.330 --> 34:47.910]  I think Colin might be deceptively thick.
[34:48.250 --> 34:49.630]  Someone deep fried one.
[34:49.790 --> 34:50.810]  Oh, no!
[34:51.130 --> 34:51.850]  That's terrible.
[34:53.430 --> 34:54.330]  That's terrible.
[34:54.630 --> 34:55.850]  Colin looks like...
[34:55.850 --> 35:03.510]  Colin looks like when they would find a character in the Alien franchise that has been, like, stuck to the wall and is waiting to die.
[35:03.870 --> 35:05.230]  Colin just looks so...
[35:05.230 --> 35:06.690]  He's not having a good day.
[35:06.810 --> 35:07.930]  Yeah, they're keeping it alive.
[35:08.210 --> 35:11.670]  Yeah, like they've been infected with the, yeah, host thing or whatever.
[35:11.970 --> 35:12.730]  It's like, oh, no.
[35:12.910 --> 35:14.130]  They're dead, but they're still here.
[35:14.210 --> 35:15.150]  That's what Colin looks like.
[35:15.770 --> 35:16.390]  That's not good.
[35:17.130 --> 35:18.750]  How much of the deep fried cake could you eat?
[35:19.030 --> 35:20.210]  I bet that'd be good as shit, dude.
[35:20.470 --> 35:20.830]  Really?
[35:20.990 --> 35:21.530]  Uh, one bite.
[35:21.990 --> 35:22.430]  Ah, yeah.
[35:22.630 --> 35:23.870]  I don't think I could go beyond a bite.
[35:24.470 --> 35:25.290]  Nick says half of it.
[35:25.370 --> 35:25.730]  That's...
[35:25.730 --> 35:26.190]  That's bold.
[35:26.790 --> 35:27.810]  I don't think that translates.
[35:28.570 --> 35:29.270]  I bet it does.
[35:29.270 --> 35:33.430]  For Nick, he's a... Nick is, like, a garbage mailman.
[35:33.550 --> 35:33.690]  He'll definitely put it away.
[35:33.690 --> 35:34.290]  Oh, no, definitely.
[35:35.070 --> 35:37.110]  Yeah, Nick was born at a state fair.
[35:37.570 --> 35:37.770]  Yeah.
[35:39.170 --> 35:45.650]  Like, socially, I feel like Nick comes across as normal, and then you fucking put a deep fried Colin the Caterpillar in front of him, and you see the freak.
[35:45.950 --> 35:46.870]  The freak comes out.
[35:47.550 --> 35:56.450]  You actually would be more alarmed by Nick's weirdness, because he would come... he comes across as normal, and then you just put something like that in front of him, and you are... you're scared.
[35:56.450 --> 36:00.130]  You just described... you just described face jam.
[36:00.290 --> 36:00.590]  Uh-huh.
[36:01.010 --> 36:03.030]  That... that... all that is is face jam.
[36:03.170 --> 36:06.690]  It is Nick's the most normal guy, and then he's around food, and all bets are off.
[36:07.550 --> 36:11.770]  What is your least favorite food, Nick, that you just can't stand?
[36:12.810 --> 36:15.610]  Oh, that's such a tough question.
[36:16.070 --> 36:20.450]  Uh, I... I want to say...
[36:21.310 --> 36:22.410]  Nope, it's not that.
[36:23.650 --> 36:25.510]  Just... any of them. Just name any of them.
[36:25.510 --> 36:27.550]  Can you think of a food you don't like?
[36:28.090 --> 36:28.170]  Yeah.
[36:28.230 --> 36:34.250]  No, I like everything. I will eat anything. Uh, no, I like anchovies. Those are good. Uh...
[36:34.250 --> 36:37.130]  What about those pickles in the bag that people are eating?
[36:37.470 --> 36:38.370]  Oh, delicious. Love them.
[36:38.690 --> 36:39.490]  Gas station pickles?
[36:39.830 --> 36:40.230]  Oh, yeah.
[36:40.330 --> 36:41.030]  Is that what they're called?
[36:41.790 --> 36:42.630]  I mean, that's what you buy them.
[36:42.790 --> 36:44.070]  I like gas station hot dogs.
[36:44.890 --> 36:46.910]  Well, they're great. I mean, don't compare those.
[36:47.170 --> 36:50.290]  No, don't judge a gas station. A gas station hot dog has its time and place.
[36:51.150 --> 36:56.210]  Yeah, it was... the time and place was 18 years ago before it expired, but they're still selling it to you.
[36:56.630 --> 37:00.410]  No. It's like a fine line. You need those 18 years.
[37:01.970 --> 37:02.610]  It's fermenting.
[37:03.070 --> 37:03.390]  Yeah.
[37:04.130 --> 37:05.090]  Need a corkscrew there.
[37:06.150 --> 37:08.330]  How about... have you ever had haggis? Do you like that?
[37:08.470 --> 37:09.870]  Oh, I love haggis. It's delicious.
[37:10.070 --> 37:10.670]  No, you don't.
[37:10.730 --> 37:11.070]  I do.
[37:11.730 --> 37:11.890]  Yeah.
[37:12.710 --> 37:13.450]  That's the worst.
[37:13.490 --> 37:15.010]  The last time I went to Scotland, it was delicious.
[37:16.250 --> 37:18.930]  Well, if you like haggis, there's nothing on Earth you don't like.
[37:18.930 --> 37:20.390]  Yeah, I'm kind of a freak.
[37:21.610 --> 37:22.350]  Do you like olives?
[37:22.870 --> 37:26.010]  I love olives. I'm snacking on them all day.
[37:27.210 --> 37:27.850]  Hey, thanks, man.
[37:29.550 --> 37:30.650]  Do you like cucumber?
[37:32.030 --> 37:34.790]  Oh, you know what? I'll tell you what. Cucumber, my least favorite food. There you go.
[37:35.110 --> 37:35.830]  There you go.
[37:36.070 --> 37:37.990]  That felt... that didn't seem genuine.
[37:38.090 --> 37:39.030]  Yeah, that was bullshit.
[37:39.170 --> 37:40.490]  That was really forced.
[37:40.510 --> 37:43.130]  And that's so inoffensive, too. Like, they're not strong.
[37:43.210 --> 37:46.830]  Yeah, but when people... people who don't like cucumber fucking hate cucumber.
[37:47.330 --> 37:48.390]  Like Gus is like that.
[37:48.390 --> 37:52.970]  Yeah, if you... if there's a cucumber in the room, he can smell it and he won't eat anything.
[37:53.490 --> 37:54.510]  I don't...
[37:54.510 --> 37:55.570]  Right, but I don't believe it.
[37:55.810 --> 37:58.730]  I don't believe it just because he was so fast to be like, I love the gas station.
[37:58.750 --> 37:59.050]  Yeah.
[37:59.230 --> 38:00.830]  Like, that's why I just don't believe it.
[38:00.930 --> 38:08.330]  But pickle, I know it's just a cucumber technically, but pickles are far superior and cucumbers are just like, meh.
[38:08.490 --> 38:08.790]  Exactly, meh.
[38:08.790 --> 38:11.770]  The food that you hate the most is just meh?
[38:11.810 --> 38:12.010]  Yeah.
[38:12.190 --> 38:16.290]  He would... he'd eat that fucking cucumber like Pac-Man and then just be like, eh.
[38:16.910 --> 38:17.050]  Yeah.
[38:17.050 --> 38:18.050]  But he'd still devour it.
[38:18.130 --> 38:18.830]  I wouldn't enjoy it.
[38:19.130 --> 38:19.710]  It's not a hurdle.
[38:20.230 --> 38:27.730]  I love that we're making fun of a dude who has a much healthier relationship to food than any of us because he's open to all of it.
[38:27.950 --> 38:31.870]  And he's like, his options are wide fucking open and I'm like, you freak.
[38:32.690 --> 38:33.570]  You weirdo.
[38:33.770 --> 38:35.030]  You accepting weirdo.
[38:35.590 --> 38:41.310]  I agree with some of that, but if he's excited about deep fried Colin the Caterpillar, that's... he's earned freak.
[38:41.530 --> 38:42.090]  That's a freak thing.
[38:42.090 --> 38:43.850]  Well, here's what we do then to put it to the test.
[38:43.850 --> 38:50.270]  Once Geoff has been gassed out of the port-a-potty by the rancid fermented fish, maybe Nick has a little bit on toast.
[38:52.170 --> 38:53.590]  Oh, my God.
[38:54.090 --> 38:54.530]  What do you think?
[38:55.410 --> 38:57.370]  I'm a little less inclined for that idea.
[39:00.290 --> 39:01.110]  That's a yes.
[39:01.810 --> 39:02.070]  What?
[39:04.130 --> 39:05.470]  Okay, I'll try. Sure.
[39:05.950 --> 39:07.690]  He'll try it. That's impressive.
[39:08.710 --> 39:14.730]  I will say, I felt in the past when we've done food things and Nick, when you've been like, you know what? Not bad.
[39:15.210 --> 39:17.510]  That has meant something and it no longer does.
[39:17.770 --> 39:18.690]  It no longer means anything.
[39:19.550 --> 39:23.770]  Not in a negative way, you're a big food guy in a way that I've never heard anyone else be.
[39:24.110 --> 39:25.690]  He is a very positive food guy.
[39:25.790 --> 39:30.510]  He found things to like about my plumber's pizza that did not really exist for anyone else.
[39:30.930 --> 39:32.770]  Oh, the crust was so good.
[39:33.450 --> 39:34.070]  I'd make it again.
[39:34.190 --> 39:34.570]  Decent crust.
[39:34.570 --> 39:37.090]  Oh, man.
[39:37.210 --> 39:42.710]  Speaking of the ingredients of your plumber's pizza, I don't think any of you guys watched the TV show Succession.
[39:43.610 --> 39:44.670]  But it just ended.
[39:45.710 --> 39:47.130]  They just had their series finale.
[39:47.390 --> 39:53.110]  And in the last episode, they were like, it's like siblings fighting over control of the company.
[39:53.210 --> 39:54.450]  And it's like two brothers and a sister.
[39:55.090 --> 40:00.730]  And they were, one of the brothers and the sister were pranking and kind of fucking with the other brother.
[40:00.730 --> 40:04.110]  And they made him a smoothie that he had to drink.
[40:04.190 --> 40:05.830]  And they put as much gross stuff as they could.
[40:05.930 --> 40:06.970]  And then he had to drink it.
[40:07.670 --> 40:10.130]  And they put a shitload of Branston pickle on.
[40:10.250 --> 40:11.270]  And he really drank it.
[40:11.530 --> 40:12.370]  Yeah, he really drank it.
[40:12.470 --> 40:13.970]  But they talked about it.
[40:14.230 --> 40:17.110]  Like, Shiv was like, how about a spoonful of Branston pickle?
[40:17.270 --> 40:18.370]  You love Branston pickle.
[40:18.710 --> 40:20.750]  And I was like, oh, fuck. Worlds collide.
[40:21.670 --> 40:22.250]  That's amazing.
[40:22.930 --> 40:23.290]  Yeah.
[40:23.730 --> 40:25.170]  It's the only time I've ever seen it in the wild.
[40:25.430 --> 40:26.470]  I know I need to watch that show.
[40:26.550 --> 40:29.470]  And that's going to probably tip me towards making it the next show I watch.
[40:29.910 --> 40:30.330]  It's a great show.
[40:30.330 --> 40:31.050]  Real good show.
[40:31.610 --> 40:34.990]  You're going to have to make it through four seasons to get to the Branston pickle, though.
[40:36.310 --> 40:37.750]  It's in the endgame.
[40:38.350 --> 40:39.310]  It's all good there, right?
[40:39.850 --> 40:40.930]  Yeah, it's really, really good.
[40:41.370 --> 40:41.870]  It's funny.
[40:42.350 --> 40:43.870]  It's funnier than I would have expected.
[40:44.270 --> 40:45.230]  Do you want a slime update?
[40:45.470 --> 40:46.590]  I'd love a slime update.
[40:47.330 --> 40:48.090]  It's the same.
[40:48.470 --> 40:49.810]  But I've got new fungus.
[40:50.290 --> 40:51.070]  Oh, no.
[40:51.790 --> 40:52.590]  What's that?
[40:53.050 --> 40:54.450]  And why is it eating my friends?
[40:55.090 --> 40:58.310]  I think that fungus looks more delicious than Colin the Caterpillar.
[40:58.310 --> 41:01.370]  You are hateful.
[41:02.130 --> 41:04.810]  No, I'm not saying the fungus is delicious.
[41:05.150 --> 41:08.350]  I'm saying if you imagine that as a cake pattern, I think that looks pretty good.
[41:08.630 --> 41:11.470]  Gavin, I don't think he likes you anymore.
[41:12.070 --> 41:12.770]  I love Gavin.
[41:13.770 --> 41:15.370]  There's a difference between loving somebody and liking them.
[41:15.370 --> 41:17.050]  I love him so much.
[41:17.530 --> 41:17.970]  I know.
[41:17.990 --> 41:18.530]  I think Gavin's great.
[41:18.550 --> 41:19.390]  That's what makes it harder.
[41:19.830 --> 41:23.190]  I feel lucky to know Andrew, especially when random people talk to me about him.
[41:24.030 --> 41:26.250]  It is one of my favorite things now.
[41:26.350 --> 41:30.470]  And it happens like maybe every two weeks, somebody will approach me to talk about f***face.
[41:30.590 --> 41:32.510]  And then they'll go like, so Andrew's real?
[41:32.990 --> 41:33.670]  And it's...
[41:34.990 --> 41:36.130]  Kind of, yeah.
[41:37.030 --> 41:37.990]  Kind of?
[41:38.350 --> 41:39.050]  As far as we know.
[41:40.070 --> 41:41.570]  It's not like I've seen you in a while.
[41:43.510 --> 41:46.390]  What movie have you watched that you remember the least about?
[41:46.930 --> 41:48.770]  It might be Austin Powers 2.
[41:49.230 --> 41:49.730]  It's funny you say that.
[41:49.730 --> 41:50.070]  Really?
[41:50.470 --> 41:53.390]  Yeah, I said somebody talked to me about Austin Powers 2.
[41:54.110 --> 41:54.530]  And I...
[41:54.530 --> 41:54.890]  Mini-me?
[41:55.290 --> 41:56.110]  I remember him.
[41:56.310 --> 41:57.990]  But it was like the whole beginning of the movie.
[41:58.270 --> 41:59.490]  And I didn't remember it.
[41:59.590 --> 42:01.770]  And I know I've seen that movie like ten times.
[42:02.010 --> 42:03.950]  And I just have zero memory of what happened.
[42:04.270 --> 42:04.750]  Oh, wow.
[42:05.030 --> 42:06.810]  I've seen the Babadook like three times.
[42:06.910 --> 42:08.270]  I couldn't tell you anything about it.
[42:08.570 --> 42:11.710]  The only thing I remember is that she was folding clothes in her backyard.
[42:12.530 --> 42:14.530]  Why would you watch the Babadook three times?
[42:14.530 --> 42:16.590]  Because everybody said it was really good.
[42:16.670 --> 42:18.810]  And I watched it and fell asleep in it.
[42:18.810 --> 42:20.390]  And so I decided to watch it again.
[42:20.670 --> 42:22.890]  And then like a month later, somebody was talking to me about it.
[42:22.950 --> 42:26.150]  And I realized that whatever I saw the second time, I retained none of.
[42:26.330 --> 42:28.210]  So I watched it a third time and fell asleep in it.
[42:28.270 --> 42:30.030]  But I'm told it's a great movie.
[42:30.170 --> 42:31.170]  But I've...
[42:31.170 --> 42:32.010]  I can't...
[42:32.010 --> 42:32.310]  I think...
[42:32.310 --> 42:33.690]  I know she...
[42:34.130 --> 42:34.450]  Fucking...
[42:34.450 --> 42:34.850]  What's her name?
[42:34.930 --> 42:35.970]  From the...
[42:37.390 --> 42:38.030]  Detective show.
[42:38.130 --> 42:39.210]  The Australian detective show.
[42:39.350 --> 42:39.550]  Uh-huh.
[42:39.810 --> 42:41.370]  She's hanging some clothes in the backyard.
[42:41.770 --> 42:42.610]  And then...
[42:42.610 --> 42:43.730]  I guess there's another...
[42:43.730 --> 42:44.510]  There's more to the movie.
[42:44.610 --> 42:45.410]  But that's all I remember.
[42:45.530 --> 42:46.650]  And I've seen that part three times.
[42:46.710 --> 42:47.230]  That's sort of it.
[42:47.230 --> 42:48.270]  He kind of got it.
[42:49.070 --> 42:51.470]  I really like three quarters of the Babadook.
[42:51.790 --> 42:52.710]  I think it's a really...
[42:52.710 --> 42:55.330]  It plays with this interesting theme of like...
[42:55.330 --> 42:56.410]  Is something supernatural happening?
[42:57.350 --> 43:00.870]  Or is this just like a monster of a child to try to deal with?
[43:00.930 --> 43:02.330]  And she was slowly losing her mind.
[43:02.750 --> 43:03.370]  Mrs. Fisher.
[43:03.590 --> 43:04.590]  That's the lady in it.
[43:05.730 --> 43:06.190]  Is that her...
[43:06.190 --> 43:07.390]  Is that the detective name?
[43:08.170 --> 43:08.570]  Or...
[43:08.570 --> 43:09.910]  Yeah, that's her show she was in.
[43:09.990 --> 43:10.250]  Okay.
[43:11.110 --> 43:11.990]  What about you, Gavin?
[43:12.410 --> 43:15.610]  Well, if you told me that the whole world is now hostage.
[43:15.610 --> 43:18.590]  And in order to save the world, the planet, from blowing up.
[43:18.970 --> 43:21.610]  You have to tell me the plot from Valerian.
[43:22.610 --> 43:23.950]  That Luc Besson movie.
[43:24.870 --> 43:25.850]  Everyone would be dead.
[43:26.130 --> 43:26.690]  Like, I couldn't...
[43:27.790 --> 43:30.310]  I can't remember a single thing about that film.
[43:30.630 --> 43:32.190]  But I sat through the entire thing.
[43:32.310 --> 43:33.250]  Like, I went to the theater.
[43:33.630 --> 43:38.110]  And it's worrying to me how I can't get anything out of my memory for that.
[43:38.770 --> 43:40.970]  Valerian, the Guy Ritchie one, where he's in prison?
[43:42.270 --> 43:42.710]  No.
[43:42.710 --> 43:46.710]  No, it's like a Cara Delevingne...
[43:48.870 --> 43:50.090]  Like, Fifth Element style.
[43:50.390 --> 43:51.030]  Oh, okay.
[43:51.230 --> 43:51.890]  Is, uh...
[43:51.890 --> 43:54.130]  What's-His-Face, Magic Mike in that too?
[43:54.810 --> 43:55.210]  Channing Tatum?
[43:55.610 --> 43:56.170]  Channing Tatum.
[43:56.610 --> 43:59.970]  I think you might be thinking of Jupiter Ascending?
[44:00.210 --> 44:01.770]  I might be thinking of that one instead.
[44:02.210 --> 44:03.070]  I've seen both of them.
[44:03.190 --> 44:04.290]  And I couldn't tell you anything about either of them.
[44:05.550 --> 44:06.870]  Those are airplane movies.
[44:07.670 --> 44:09.010]  Yeah, they are.
[44:09.130 --> 44:10.290]  It's a great way to describe them.
[44:10.290 --> 44:18.330]  It is, just based on this cover, it's the least charismatic people you've ever seen being near each other in space.
[44:18.510 --> 44:19.290]  Look at...
[44:19.990 --> 44:21.210]  Oh, is that Clive Owen?
[44:21.730 --> 44:22.430]  And Rihanna?
[44:23.070 --> 44:24.430]  It might be. I think it might be Clive Owen.
[44:24.430 --> 44:25.230]  Weird, great subcast.
[44:25.550 --> 44:26.430]  It is Clive Owen and Rihanna.
[44:26.430 --> 44:30.770]  Like, to me, visually, that's gonna be something memorable in there.
[44:30.910 --> 44:33.010]  But I remember literally nothing.
[44:34.570 --> 44:36.450]  Was Rihanna in Valerian?
[44:37.110 --> 44:37.430]  Apparently.
[44:37.790 --> 44:39.530]  That can't be. That can't be her.
[44:39.530 --> 44:42.970]  Why wouldn't it be? She was in fucking Battleship.
[44:43.390 --> 44:45.370]  Yeah, but that was the first movie.
[44:45.610 --> 44:46.050]  It's her.
[44:46.870 --> 44:49.890]  And she's near some aliens and a robot?
[44:50.650 --> 44:53.850]  Also, I think this was technically an independent movie.
[44:53.950 --> 44:58.090]  I think the director spent like 200 million dollars of his own money on it.
[44:58.430 --> 44:59.610]  This was Luc Besson, right?
[45:00.070 --> 45:00.310]  Yeah.
[45:00.930 --> 45:03.230]  Latin made some really good movies before this one.
[45:04.110 --> 45:10.570]  It looks like if you ask like an AI to make a poster of a generic like sci-fi movie.
[45:10.770 --> 45:13.090]  There's like no soul in any of this.
[45:13.570 --> 45:15.790]  Which is weird because Fifth Element has so much soul.
[45:16.170 --> 45:18.690]  Yeah. Yeah. Crazy.
[45:19.390 --> 45:21.410]  He made them be professional, right? I mean, fuck.
[45:21.490 --> 45:22.230]  He did. Yeah.
[45:22.750 --> 45:26.170]  He made La Femme Nikita. Dude, he made La Femme Nikita. God damn.
[45:26.490 --> 45:28.050]  I feel like he's got some bad movies.
[45:28.330 --> 45:29.910]  He's got some weird action shit.
[45:30.530 --> 45:33.810]  I don't know if he did all the Takens, but if he directed Taken 2 and 3.
[45:34.070 --> 45:35.790]  That's not great for your resume.
[45:36.370 --> 45:37.770]  Wait, did he direct it or write it?
[45:38.190 --> 45:39.190]  He wrote...
[45:39.190 --> 45:39.850]  Did he write?
[45:40.310 --> 45:41.970]  Did he write them? Did he not direct any of them?
[45:42.470 --> 45:43.010]  Let me see.
[45:43.230 --> 45:44.570]  I don't think he directed Taken.
[45:48.750 --> 45:51.230]  No, he did not.
[45:52.810 --> 45:55.190]  He directed Lucy, whatever the fuck that is.
[45:55.230 --> 45:56.730]  Hey, are you thinking of The Transporter?
[45:57.770 --> 45:58.650]  Yeah, maybe.
[45:59.510 --> 46:01.590]  He wrote The Transporter.
[46:02.170 --> 46:03.930]  Well, he wrote Taken as well.
[46:03.950 --> 46:06.450]  He also did Taken as well. I just think he maybe didn't direct it.
[46:07.070 --> 46:07.170]  Yeah.
[46:07.750 --> 46:10.370]  I got into Orangina because of The Transporter as a kid.
[46:11.310 --> 46:12.630]  That was my introduction to Orangina.
[46:13.110 --> 46:13.890]  Great beverage.
[46:14.970 --> 46:15.710]  Do you still drink it?
[46:16.210 --> 46:18.510]  Yeah. It's in my rotation. It's not a regular.
[46:18.690 --> 46:23.530]  But there's a scene where, because of The Transporter, he's transporting something and he doesn't know what it is.
[46:23.530 --> 46:29.170]  Then it turns out to be a person and he cuts open their duct tape and he gives them Orangina through a straw.
[46:29.290 --> 46:30.530]  And I was like, that looks good.
[46:30.950 --> 46:32.430]  So I tried it and it was good.
[46:33.390 --> 46:34.290]  I recommend it.
[46:34.830 --> 46:35.730]  Good advertising.
[46:37.630 --> 46:38.110]  Effective.
[46:38.570 --> 46:39.410]  Some may say.
[46:41.490 --> 46:44.170]  If it's good enough for a hostage, it's good enough for me.
[46:44.530 --> 46:48.570]  I wonder if Orangina saw a bump when that movie came out.
[46:48.990 --> 46:49.950]  That'd be interesting.
[46:51.570 --> 46:52.550]  That'd be really interesting.
[46:52.550 --> 46:54.590]  It's funny how that works with movies.
[46:54.690 --> 46:55.390]  People are so dumb.
[46:56.570 --> 47:01.470]  When The Graduate came out, plastic stocks, invest in plastic, people took that literally.
[47:02.070 --> 47:06.390]  I watched a thing about how Sideways completely shifted the wine market.
[47:07.430 --> 47:10.290]  Because he said, I don't want another fucking Merlot.
[47:10.750 --> 47:12.870]  And Merlot suddenly plummeted after it.
[47:12.970 --> 47:15.610]  And there's a scene where he has a monologue about how great Pinot Noir is.
[47:15.950 --> 47:19.150]  And Pinot Noir quadrupled in production.
[47:19.430 --> 47:21.530]  And then you got the value of the Don Zimmer card.
[47:21.530 --> 47:22.570]  Oh, yeah.
[47:22.750 --> 47:24.410]  There you go.
[47:25.090 --> 47:26.010]  Another great example.
[47:26.370 --> 47:28.090]  I never saw that movie, Sideways.
[47:28.370 --> 47:29.250]  I'm glad I didn't see it.
[47:29.830 --> 47:33.310]  I just know that it's like a known thing that it impacted the wine market.
[47:34.090 --> 47:36.610]  I had a nice moment with you recently, Geoff.
[47:36.810 --> 47:37.690]  Was I a part of it?
[47:37.870 --> 47:38.490]  Yeah, you were.
[47:40.030 --> 47:43.030]  I think it might tie me back with Gavin.
[47:43.210 --> 47:45.190]  I think this could be the thing that bridges us back.
[47:45.270 --> 47:46.330]  Because he said there's some confusion.
[47:46.810 --> 47:47.870]  There's some conflict.
[47:47.870 --> 47:51.990]  Gavin, as you know, there's been a bird in my roof that has been driving me crazy.
[47:52.150 --> 47:53.210]  I have not been able to sleep.
[47:53.670 --> 47:54.750]  You sent me those files.
[47:54.930 --> 47:56.230]  I need to check in on that.
[47:56.710 --> 47:59.070]  Yeah, so I sent Geoff the file.
[47:59.250 --> 48:01.110]  And he was kind enough to run it through.
[48:01.830 --> 48:04.070]  Because my phone, it just kept crashing.
[48:04.770 --> 48:08.650]  And when you run it through, it tells you where other people have reported this bird.
[48:09.450 --> 48:10.470]  There's some Oxfordshire.
[48:11.210 --> 48:12.430]  I should have sent it to you.
[48:13.550 --> 48:15.150]  You may have recognized it.
[48:15.510 --> 48:16.450]  I may have grown up with it.
[48:16.450 --> 48:17.810]  You may have grown up with this bird.
[48:17.930 --> 48:20.130]  Here, I'll put the clip in now. You can listen to it.
[48:20.150 --> 48:21.690]  You can tell me if you grew up with this bird.
[48:22.230 --> 48:23.270]  Here we go. Bird Sherp.
[48:24.170 --> 48:25.510]  You can listen to it.
[48:25.670 --> 48:26.170]  I'm playing it.
[48:30.550 --> 48:30.950]  You...
[48:32.790 --> 48:34.870]  You are a just a...
[48:36.350 --> 48:38.370]  You got caviar, Gavin!
[48:39.670 --> 48:40.470]  Johnny Caviar!
[48:40.690 --> 48:42.590]  Johnny Caviar came out!
[48:42.950 --> 48:46.590]  He's the kind of guy that slips fonts into Bird Sherp.mp3.
[48:47.650 --> 48:48.650]  You're an animal!
[48:50.870 --> 48:52.170]  Caviar, you're real good.
[48:53.470 --> 48:56.070]  I just got two barrels of caviar.
[48:58.030 --> 48:59.930]  Now, Geoff, have you really not listened to that?
[49:00.190 --> 49:01.350]  No, I haven't listened to it yet.
[49:01.550 --> 49:03.550]  Oh my god, so I thought...
[49:03.550 --> 49:06.510]  I had been setting up this joke for over a month.
[49:07.150 --> 49:10.050]  I had... Before you went to Italy, Geoff...
[49:10.050 --> 49:12.030]  I set it up where...
[49:12.030 --> 49:14.330]  I just... I was gassy.
[49:14.330 --> 49:16.370]  And I was like, you know what? I'm going to record a fart.
[49:16.850 --> 49:18.170]  And I'll just have it.
[49:19.150 --> 49:19.510]  And...
[49:20.170 --> 49:22.090]  Oh, that's great. That's great, Eric.
[49:22.230 --> 49:24.730]  He posted a meme of the difference between me and Johnny Caviar.
[49:25.090 --> 49:27.790]  Eric, can you throw a little puff of gas coming out of Johnny Caviar?
[49:27.930 --> 49:29.910]  Yeah, he's got a little poof out of his butthole.
[49:30.350 --> 49:32.090]  I saw... Here, I'll post...
[49:32.090 --> 49:33.690]  I was going to share this as well with Johnny Caviar.
[49:33.790 --> 49:36.510]  Somebody posted this in the Discord for the show.
[49:36.710 --> 49:37.310]  Or for F*** Face.
[49:37.770 --> 49:38.770]  I thought that was funny.
[49:40.010 --> 49:41.950]  Me as Winnie the Pooh with Johnny Caviar.
[49:41.950 --> 49:43.670]  Me as Winnie the Pooh in a tuxedo.
[49:45.250 --> 49:49.270]  The problem with Johnny Caviar is it's just me without empathy.
[49:49.510 --> 49:50.330]  You guys inventing...
[49:50.330 --> 49:52.030]  Like, pushing the Johnny Caviar thing.
[49:52.770 --> 49:53.790]  Was a mistake.
[49:54.350 --> 49:57.650]  But, to go back to that gag that I've been trying to pay off.
[49:57.990 --> 49:59.030]  I recorded it.
[49:59.550 --> 50:01.330]  And I was texting you about this, Geoff.
[50:01.550 --> 50:02.770]  Before you went on your trip.
[50:02.970 --> 50:03.910]  A long time ago.
[50:04.190 --> 50:05.570]  And I queued it all up.
[50:05.870 --> 50:07.510]  And then I went to send it to you.
[50:07.650 --> 50:08.810]  And the file vanished.
[50:09.270 --> 50:10.590]  And I had to like, lie.
[50:10.710 --> 50:12.190]  And be like, oh, I don't know.
[50:12.390 --> 50:15.050]  I'll have to try to find it.
[50:15.390 --> 50:16.810]  So then I got another fart.
[50:17.370 --> 50:19.570]  And I was like, when will I deploy this thing?
[50:19.890 --> 50:20.970]  When do I want to do this?
[50:20.990 --> 50:22.030]  And I just kept sitting on it.
[50:22.250 --> 50:23.830]  Then I brought it up on the show.
[50:24.270 --> 50:25.790]  To like, build to it a little bit more.
[50:26.330 --> 50:28.890]  And then I thought, okay, it's time to do this.
[50:29.170 --> 50:30.570]  Were you lying about the bird?
[50:30.970 --> 50:32.190]  Yeah, no, there's no bird in my roof.
[50:32.430 --> 50:35.650]  There are birds in my roof.
[50:35.690 --> 50:36.630]  But they're not waking me up.
[50:37.150 --> 50:38.810]  It was just all an invention
[50:38.810 --> 50:40.670]  to try to get you to listen to my fart.
[50:40.810 --> 50:41.290]  Unknowingly.
[50:41.770 --> 50:43.110]  You said the fart was from Oxfordshire?
[50:46.170 --> 50:47.090]  It may have been.
[50:47.810 --> 50:50.870]  We are entering into a new era
[50:50.870 --> 50:53.150]  of paranoia and mistrust.
[50:53.450 --> 50:54.750]  Was that the first Johnny Caviar
[50:54.750 --> 50:55.350]  blindside?
[50:55.950 --> 50:58.610]  It is. It's a Johnny Caviar move for sure.
[51:00.090 --> 51:00.870]  But anyway,
[51:01.570 --> 51:02.510]  I had been
[51:02.510 --> 51:03.870]  sinning on this. I set it up.
[51:03.870 --> 51:06.170]  I talked about it on the show. I was like, now I can deploy this
[51:06.170 --> 51:07.490]  anytime I want.
[51:07.830 --> 51:09.890]  And it was such a great f*** face moment where I decided
[51:09.890 --> 51:12.150]  I am going to deploy this now.
[51:12.590 --> 51:13.870]  And so I set it up to Geoff
[51:13.870 --> 51:15.690]  and I sent him the file and I was feeling
[51:15.690 --> 51:16.710]  real good about myself.
[51:17.210 --> 51:19.410]  And then I looked at my phone and I saw
[51:19.410 --> 51:21.930]  it was game three of Celtics
[51:21.930 --> 51:23.930]  versus the Heat was happening.
[51:24.430 --> 51:25.770]  And they were down by
[51:25.770 --> 51:27.470]  ten in the first quarter.
[51:27.630 --> 51:29.150]  And I felt so bad.
[51:29.270 --> 51:32.170]  I would never deploy a Johnny Caviar move
[51:32.170 --> 51:34.370]  against you in game three.
[51:34.470 --> 51:36.050]  I was like, he's going to be
[51:37.490 --> 51:38.450]  so miserable.
[51:38.990 --> 51:40.030]  This is so bad.
[51:40.110 --> 51:42.270]  So I kept watching. I check in
[51:42.270 --> 51:43.990]  on the game regularly to be like, please,
[51:44.070 --> 51:46.130]  for the love of God, win. Win this
[51:46.130 --> 51:47.510]  f***ing game. I need you to win.
[51:47.750 --> 51:49.830]  And they blew it. It was their worst game
[51:49.830 --> 51:51.010]  of the series.
[51:51.490 --> 51:53.650]  To that point.
[51:54.450 --> 51:56.070]  Game seven was not great. But they were
[51:56.070 --> 51:57.870]  absolutely dog s***
[51:57.870 --> 52:00.250]  in game three. And I felt so much
[52:00.250 --> 52:01.950]  guilt that I deployed the move
[52:01.950 --> 52:04.430]  and you didn't acknowledge it at all.
[52:04.790 --> 52:05.750]  Zero acknowledgement.
[52:06.370 --> 52:07.290]  Here's the deal.
[52:07.990 --> 52:09.730]  I've been trying to be less
[52:10.270 --> 52:11.750]  around my phone in general.
[52:11.950 --> 52:13.810]  So I've been making a concerted effort
[52:13.810 --> 52:15.990]  to put it in another room
[52:15.990 --> 52:18.150]  and then leave that room so I just don't
[52:18.150 --> 52:20.050]  think about it. I'm trying to break my f***ing
[52:20.050 --> 52:21.130]  phone fumbling addiction.
[52:21.810 --> 52:24.110]  And kind of just live more present in the world
[52:24.110 --> 52:25.350]  in front of me instead of on my phone.
[52:25.790 --> 52:28.150]  But also, I mean, I've just been
[52:28.150 --> 52:30.110]  such a... just a
[52:30.110 --> 52:32.270]  shuddered wreck of a human
[52:32.270 --> 52:34.430]  because of this Celtics
[52:34.430 --> 52:36.310]  Heat series. I've just
[52:36.310 --> 52:38.110]  been so distracted. I have been
[52:38.110 --> 52:40.030]  forgetting stuff left and right. And I think
[52:40.030 --> 52:42.070]  I may have even seen it
[52:42.070 --> 52:44.250]  and been like, well, clearly I have bigger
[52:44.250 --> 52:46.110]  problems to worry about right now than
[52:46.110 --> 52:48.170]  identifying Andrew's bird because
[52:48.170 --> 52:49.070]  I'm dealing with
[52:50.010 --> 52:52.130]  the Celtics imploding for no f***ing reason
[52:52.130 --> 52:54.360]  against a geriatric, non-f***ing
[52:55.350 --> 52:55.890]  drafted
[52:55.890 --> 52:57.210]  bulls*** team
[52:57.910 --> 52:59.790]  cobbled together under
[52:59.790 --> 53:02.030]  a phenomenally, evilly, wickedly
[53:02.030 --> 53:03.610]  talented coach. And
[53:04.150 --> 53:05.990]  so I just... it slipped out of
[53:05.990 --> 53:07.850]  the periphery of my memory and I
[53:07.850 --> 53:09.590]  didn't remember it until this one... this
[53:09.590 --> 53:10.870]  instant you brought it up.
[53:11.470 --> 53:13.910]  I'm glad. I felt so bad that
[53:14.590 --> 53:15.090]  I...
[53:15.090 --> 53:17.790]  I feel bad that I ignored you and didn't realize it.
[53:18.030 --> 53:19.290]  I'm sorry. I'm glad you did.
[53:20.270 --> 53:21.650]  Even though it was aimed at us,
[53:21.750 --> 53:23.350]  I really like Johnny Cavia.
[53:23.350 --> 53:25.530]  I really liked birdchirp.mp3
[53:27.530 --> 53:29.430]  I think that was a fantastic intro to
[53:29.430 --> 53:31.330]  Johnny Cavia. I went through a lot of
[53:31.330 --> 53:33.110]  variations on what to call it. It was
[53:33.110 --> 53:35.370]  a real... I was like bird noise
[53:35.370 --> 53:37.290]  will that tip it off? Nah, it should be birdchirp.
[53:37.530 --> 53:39.510]  Should it be birdchirp or birdchirps?
[53:39.610 --> 53:40.930]  I'll just go birdchirp. There was thought.
[53:41.410 --> 53:41.950]  It's calculated.
[53:43.270 --> 53:44.630]  I like Johnny Cavia.
[53:46.150 --> 53:47.190]  Count me as a fan.
[53:47.470 --> 53:49.390]  I like the idea of Andrew in a tuxedo at all
[53:49.390 --> 53:49.710]  times.
[53:54.050 --> 53:55.810]  I don't think I've worn a tux
[53:55.810 --> 53:56.870]  since I was like five.
[53:57.230 --> 53:58.850]  Since you were in that fucking Men in Black photo.
[53:59.430 --> 54:01.610]  Oh, fuck, you're right. That would have been after that.
[54:01.730 --> 54:01.970]  Yeah.
[54:02.190 --> 54:04.810]  It was probably like ten, probably like eighteen years.
[54:05.250 --> 54:07.170]  Do you think now that you've recovered from
[54:07.170 --> 54:08.930]  COVID that you're ready for the marathon?
[54:10.110 --> 54:10.750]  Fuck you.
[54:12.290 --> 54:13.710]  There's such an instant anger
[54:13.710 --> 54:14.350]  at the gate.
[54:15.170 --> 54:17.410]  Because I'm not 100% back yet, anyway.
[54:18.150 --> 54:19.330]  Where are you at?
[54:20.310 --> 54:21.250]  I'd say I'm
[54:21.250 --> 54:23.250]  at my peak 80%.
[54:24.130 --> 54:25.950]  There are times where I'm down to 40.
[54:26.210 --> 54:27.410]  How's the sleeping going?
[54:27.650 --> 54:29.670]  Are you having better success?
[54:30.930 --> 54:32.070]  I'm having some
[54:32.070 --> 54:33.690]  problems recently with the sleeping
[54:33.690 --> 54:35.630]  in the sense of I have an issue
[54:35.630 --> 54:37.890]  that I don't know if I'm
[54:37.890 --> 54:39.850]  remembering my dreams or
[54:39.850 --> 54:41.670]  if I'm waking up and thinking I'm still in them.
[54:42.230 --> 54:43.870]  I don't know if you guys have experienced this
[54:43.870 --> 54:45.070]  where like
[54:45.770 --> 54:47.990]  you will wake up and think
[54:47.990 --> 54:49.430]  something is happening that is not.
[54:49.870 --> 54:51.370]  That's type of dream and there's no way
[54:51.370 --> 54:51.890]  it could happen.
[54:53.010 --> 54:55.010]  So I'll give an example. When Succession
[54:55.010 --> 54:57.450]  when around the finale of Succession happened
[54:57.450 --> 54:59.270]  I had a dream that
[54:59.970 --> 55:00.370]  somehow
[55:01.030 --> 55:03.670]  I was involved in some financial market
[55:03.670 --> 55:05.330]  and it either, I don't remember if it
[55:05.330 --> 55:06.990]  crashed or if it spiked up
[55:06.990 --> 55:09.510]  and all of the pillows were on a cool down timer
[55:09.510 --> 55:10.610]  from that point.
[55:11.250 --> 55:13.370]  I couldn't use the pillows because they were on cool down.
[55:13.550 --> 55:14.990]  They had to reset the pillow system.
[55:15.850 --> 55:17.670]  And so I got up
[55:17.670 --> 55:19.010]  because I thought
[55:19.610 --> 55:21.230]  if all the pillows need to
[55:21.230 --> 55:23.070]  if all the pillows are in cool down
[55:23.510 --> 55:25.190]  what's even the point of trying to sleep?
[55:25.710 --> 55:27.410]  So I stood up and I got out of bed
[55:27.410 --> 55:29.770]  and I thought this certainly
[55:29.770 --> 55:31.870]  is not a reality. What am I doing?
[55:32.350 --> 55:33.710]  And I crawled back into bed
[55:33.710 --> 55:34.570]  and I went to sleep.
[55:35.030 --> 55:37.770]  You used your sleep super and it used all the pillows
[55:37.770 --> 55:39.630]  at once. Yes, essentially.
[55:39.830 --> 55:41.910]  It was like there was a countdown timer
[55:41.910 --> 55:43.250]  on the pillows and it was like
[55:43.250 --> 55:44.690]  we need to recalibrate.
[55:44.690 --> 55:46.490]  And so in my head I was like
[55:46.490 --> 55:48.530]  I can't use any of the pillows. What's the point?
[55:48.990 --> 55:50.990]  I'll be honest, I'm glad to hear that you're in the bed and not in the bath.
[55:51.510 --> 55:52.510]  Yeah, I'm making
[55:52.510 --> 55:53.850]  improvements. This morning
[55:54.350 --> 55:56.330]  my dream was that
[55:57.370 --> 55:58.710]  I had a Dr. Pepper
[55:58.710 --> 56:00.170]  on my bedside table
[56:00.690 --> 56:02.750]  and the Dr. Pepper cured all
[56:02.750 --> 56:04.610]  COVID symptoms. And I was very
[56:04.610 --> 56:06.390]  excited about this. I was like we gotta
[56:06.390 --> 56:08.610]  let the world know that
[56:08.610 --> 56:10.750]  this Dr. Pepper is a
[56:10.750 --> 56:11.930]  cure. Cure for all.
[56:11.930 --> 56:13.950]  And then I realized, oh no, if we
[56:13.950 --> 56:15.910]  tell people, everyone's gonna try to drink
[56:15.910 --> 56:17.890]  my Dr. Pepper and it's just gonna
[56:17.890 --> 56:20.230]  it's all gonna go away. I gotta go hide this Dr. Pepper.
[56:20.570 --> 56:21.570]  So I woke up because I had to
[56:21.570 --> 56:23.410]  vigilantly guard my Dr. Pepper.
[56:23.790 --> 56:25.830]  I was very concerned about it. It sounds like
[56:25.830 --> 56:27.990]  it takes you like 45 seconds to get out of
[56:27.990 --> 56:28.550]  sleeping.
[56:30.190 --> 56:31.430]  It happens sometimes.
[56:31.670 --> 56:33.690]  It's been a lot recently.
[56:34.330 --> 56:35.670]  Have you ever sleepwalked before?
[56:37.010 --> 56:38.050]  No. Not that I'm
[56:38.050 --> 56:40.090]  aware of. Seems like you're borderline doing it.
[56:40.090 --> 56:41.810]  Like you're giving yourself tasks and you're out of bed
[56:41.810 --> 56:42.890]  and you don't even realize you're awake.
[56:45.190 --> 56:46.150]  Remember when we were
[56:46.610 --> 56:47.990]  doing... I was trying to beat Gavin's
[56:47.990 --> 56:50.030]  trial time. I dreamt that I was
[56:50.030 --> 56:51.870]  on a trials bike and I headbutted the wall
[56:52.330 --> 56:53.130]  because I
[56:54.090 --> 56:55.930]  caught up on my knees
[56:55.930 --> 56:58.070]  and I had to adjust the body
[56:58.070 --> 57:00.010]  distribution on the bike to try to get going.
[57:00.410 --> 57:01.410]  So I guess, yeah, I'm like
[57:01.410 --> 57:03.710]  I'm not sleepwalking
[57:03.710 --> 57:06.270]  but I'm sleep doing. You're sleep active.
[57:06.810 --> 57:07.490]  I'm sleep
[57:07.490 --> 57:08.930]  positive for sure.
[57:12.010 --> 57:13.410]  Undeniably. Well, I'm glad you're finally
[57:13.410 --> 57:14.570]  testing positive for sleep.
[57:16.070 --> 57:17.530]  Oh, testing positive is not
[57:17.530 --> 57:19.830]  a problem. I've been real good at that.
[57:19.890 --> 57:20.970]  Not still though, surely.
[57:21.690 --> 57:23.650]  No, I tested negative
[57:23.650 --> 57:25.670]  on like day 13 but I'm still
[57:26.210 --> 57:27.670]  dealing with some chest stuff
[57:27.670 --> 57:28.870]  but we're getting better.
[57:29.490 --> 57:31.510]  Well, okay. That was a nice podcast.
[57:32.070 --> 57:33.310]  We learned a lot about people.
[57:34.030 --> 57:35.550]  Yeah, I guess we did.
[57:35.550 --> 57:37.470]  I was sitting here trying to think, like, Emily's
[57:37.470 --> 57:40.030]  going to come home from work later and she's going to ask me how the podcast went
[57:40.030 --> 57:41.330]  and I'll say, I think it went really well.
[57:41.450 --> 57:43.490]  I felt pretty good about it and she's going to ask what we talked about
[57:43.490 --> 57:45.310]  and I'll have no fucking clue.
[57:45.590 --> 57:47.030]  Just recite the plot of Valerian.
[57:47.810 --> 57:49.090]  Colin the Caterpillar
[57:49.090 --> 57:51.510]  and, uh, I don't know.
[57:51.950 --> 57:53.590]  Just see if she knows that you need
[57:53.590 --> 57:55.630]  to put your airpods inside
[57:55.630 --> 57:57.450]  the airpod holder. Or if you can put them inside
[57:57.450 --> 57:57.750]  an egg.
[57:59.470 --> 58:01.550]  Does all white plastic charge Apple
[58:01.550 --> 58:02.710]  products? Right.
[58:02.710 --> 58:04.410]  Is there a way without any context
[58:04.410 --> 58:06.350]  you could just say ramscoop or whooptone?
[58:06.750 --> 58:08.950]  Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to say.
[58:09.370 --> 58:09.950]  Ramscoop or whooptone.
[58:10.030 --> 58:11.030]  I want to know what she thinks.
[58:11.310 --> 58:14.150]  Does she already have too much context for ramscoop?
[58:14.790 --> 58:16.170]  No, that hasn't...
[58:16.170 --> 58:17.990]  I don't know if that's out. I guess it's out.
[58:18.350 --> 58:18.850]  I think it's out.
[58:20.610 --> 58:21.930]  She fucking listens too, she'd know.
[58:22.010 --> 58:24.350]  I mean, it's definitely out because I've gotten nothing but tweets
[58:24.350 --> 58:25.110]  that say gooch pooch.
[58:26.810 --> 58:27.790]  No, no, no!
[58:28.670 --> 58:30.330]  Don't send him tweets calling him
[58:30.330 --> 58:32.750]  gooch pooch or the gooch
[58:32.750 --> 58:34.210]  or lil gooch
[58:34.210 --> 58:36.610]  or big gooch or the goocher
[58:36.610 --> 58:37.970]  or gooch x
[58:37.970 --> 58:39.810]  or malcolm gooch
[58:39.810 --> 58:42.230]  or any of those. Just call him big dog.
[58:42.690 --> 58:44.130]  He was supposed to be big dog.
[58:44.970 --> 58:46.390]  My favorite was someone was calling
[58:46.390 --> 58:47.070]  him goosh.
[58:50.750 --> 58:52.290]  Like douche with a g.
[58:53.330 --> 58:54.430]  That's very funny.
[58:54.590 --> 58:55.210]  Okay, wrap this up.
[58:55.210 --> 58:56.030]  End this episode, please.
[58:58.230 --> 58:59.290]  What are you going to call
[58:59.290 --> 58:59.790]  this one, Eric?
[59:01.170 --> 59:03.130]  The title of this episode is
[59:03.130 --> 59:05.050]  Ramscoop vs. Whooptone
[59:05.050 --> 59:07.030]  and Turduckend Dessert.
[59:07.950 --> 59:08.990]  Oh, right.
[59:09.230 --> 59:10.230]  I totally forgot about this.
[59:10.470 --> 59:13.410]  See, these are teasers where you go
[59:13.410 --> 59:14.430]  what the fuck?
[59:14.950 --> 59:16.750]  What could this episode be about?
[59:16.990 --> 59:19.270]  And then you get your little thing at the beginning and something about
[59:19.270 --> 59:20.230]  halfway through. It feels good.
[59:21.130 --> 59:23.050]  I like birdshed.mp3
[59:24.390 --> 59:25.470]  Alright, I got it.
[59:25.510 --> 59:26.350]  I'll change that. It's good.
[59:27.610 --> 59:28.730]  Well, there you go.
[59:29.650 --> 59:31.230]  Hopefully, if you're listening to me
[59:31.230 --> 59:32.730]  say this, that means you listened to the
[59:32.730 --> 59:34.910]  whole fucking podcast. And boy, do we
[59:34.910 --> 59:36.690]  appreciate you doing that. That's not easy.
[59:37.130 --> 59:39.050]  Hopefully, you left feeling good, too.
[59:39.130 --> 59:40.470]  Let's everybody feel good.
[59:40.730 --> 59:42.110]  And let's go tell some other people, hey,
[59:42.830 --> 59:43.890]  are you having a bad day?
[59:45.130 --> 59:46.890]  Your day's fine, but it could be better.
[59:47.410 --> 59:48.990]  Do you want to feel good?
[59:49.410 --> 59:50.850]  Listen to the F*** Face podcast.
[59:50.850 --> 59:52.290]  You'll feel real good.
[59:52.410 --> 59:53.190]  Bye.
