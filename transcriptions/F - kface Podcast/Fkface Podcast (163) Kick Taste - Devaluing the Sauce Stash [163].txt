[00:00.000 --> 00:05.720]  Hey, it's producer Eric. I wanted to let you know about some supplemental content we have coming your way at the end of this week.
[00:05.780 --> 00:09.540]  If you're a Rooster Teeth First member on the 21st, you'll get the commercials draft.
[00:09.660 --> 00:11.200]  We are drafting ads from our childhood.
[00:11.640 --> 00:16.060]  If you're not a First member, you can wait until the 22nd, which will be Saturday, and that'll be free for everyone.
[00:16.400 --> 00:21.940]  But that's not all, because on the 28th, for Rooster Teeth First members, we will have the state draft.
[00:22.020 --> 00:23.100]  We're drafting states.
[00:23.560 --> 00:26.400]  If you're not a Rooster Teeth First member, you can get it for free on the 29th.
[00:26.400 --> 00:30.200]  So that's the commercials draft this week, the state draft next week.
[00:30.300 --> 00:32.880]  But right now, it's another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:33.380 --> 00:33.580]  Enjoy.
[00:44.800 --> 00:48.640]  Okay, this is episode 163.
[00:49.480 --> 00:51.620]  Uh, up to you where you guys want to take it.
[00:51.700 --> 00:54.500]  But last time, talking about, just to recap,
[00:54.880 --> 00:59.720]  the Dallas trip, movie plots, tomato, the worst soup, smeg,
[01:00.360 --> 01:03.480]  uh, kitchen tables, or I guess coffee tables,
[01:04.260 --> 01:07.260]  equidistant birthplaces, Andrew's thumbstick journey, and a thumb cam.
[01:07.540 --> 01:08.720]  So, excited to find out what happens.
[01:08.720 --> 01:09.860]  Don't forget about Nick Nameless.
[01:10.060 --> 01:13.200]  Oh yeah, Nick Nameless, that's right. Nick Nameless is the first thing I wrote, I missed it, sorry.
[01:13.780 --> 01:17.040]  Hello and welcome to episode one, huh, I didn't like that.
[01:17.400 --> 01:18.780]  Are you serious? You weren't recording?
[01:19.120 --> 01:20.060]  Now I'm recording, okay.
[01:20.300 --> 01:21.660]  Whew, that's okay, I didn't like that anyway.
[01:22.160 --> 01:22.920]  Hold on, I gotta burp.
[01:25.540 --> 01:26.900]  Is it a Sprite burp?
[01:27.180 --> 01:27.440]  Yep.
[01:28.200 --> 01:28.680]  How'd you know?
[01:29.440 --> 01:33.520]  The name of your file has been enjoying Sprite lately, or something?
[01:34.220 --> 01:37.480]  Yeah, I've been really enjoying it, I've been really liking Sprite again.
[01:37.680 --> 01:38.920]  I've been drinking a lot of Sprite.
[01:39.780 --> 01:40.000]  Whew!
[01:40.500 --> 01:41.280]  I lost that burp.
[01:41.580 --> 01:44.220]  You ever have that, where a burp just goes away, and it's a fucking-
[01:44.220 --> 01:44.960]  Oh, it's the worst.
[01:45.160 --> 01:46.440]  It's a sad feeling.
[01:46.640 --> 01:46.740]  It's terrible.
[01:46.900 --> 01:47.900]  Do you want me to come and pat your back?
[01:48.820 --> 01:49.700]  I wish you could.
[01:50.700 --> 01:52.560]  It'd take way too long for you to get over here.
[01:52.580 --> 01:56.260]  You do that, and I'll interpret the pat from here, and I'll mimic it.
[01:56.640 --> 01:59.500]  Alright, I'm just gonna go with this burping limbo.
[01:59.500 --> 02:03.780]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[02:04.180 --> 02:07.300]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, with me as always, Other People.
[02:07.540 --> 02:09.360]  This is episode 163.
[02:09.680 --> 02:10.600]  Let's get to it.
[02:10.880 --> 02:11.780]  I'm Other People.
[02:12.260 --> 02:16.260]  I feel like you're putting a lot of effort into the name of the podcast,
[02:16.660 --> 02:18.080]  and you're going really high-pitched.
[02:18.300 --> 02:19.960]  It's bleep, though, so nobody really benefits.
[02:19.980 --> 02:21.960]  I do that, that's why I do it.
[02:22.220 --> 02:22.440]  Oh.
[02:23.060 --> 02:25.020]  Yeah, that's exactly why I do it.
[02:25.040 --> 02:25.780]  Now that was funny.
[02:25.920 --> 02:26.660]  So that's just for us?
[02:27.040 --> 02:28.100]  Yeah, it's just for us.
[02:28.540 --> 02:29.620]  Honestly, it's just for me.
[02:30.020 --> 02:34.120]  Like, it's funny to me knowing that that's going to get bleeped, and no one will ever hear it.
[02:34.840 --> 02:36.320]  And that's where I put the most effort.
[02:37.480 --> 02:38.860]  Isn't that the kind of point of this whole thing?
[02:39.360 --> 02:39.640]  Yeah.
[02:39.880 --> 02:41.220]  I try to stay true to my roots.
[02:44.280 --> 02:46.080]  We didn't really talk about it.
[02:46.780 --> 02:50.480]  There's a quiet F*** Face that happened over several episodes of the show
[02:50.880 --> 02:52.800]  relating to what I got you for your birthday, Geoff.
[02:53.060 --> 02:53.880]  I was going to mention that.
[02:53.940 --> 02:56.140]  Dude, I love my birthday present from you.
[02:56.140 --> 02:56.740]  Oh, what'd you get?
[02:56.840 --> 02:57.740]  Thank you so much.
[02:58.000 --> 02:58.700]  I got Geoff.
[02:58.880 --> 03:01.500]  They do the Florida Keys.
[03:01.600 --> 03:02.300]  They they do.
[03:02.420 --> 03:06.420]  You know, I talked about the the Conk Republic, their own like nation that they made.
[03:06.580 --> 03:07.420]  Yeah, that would've been a fun state.
[03:07.500 --> 03:08.500]  That would've been a great thing to draft.
[03:08.680 --> 03:09.100]  Conk Republic.
[03:11.220 --> 03:12.380]  Back to back state talk.
[03:13.060 --> 03:16.940]  They do a thing where you could get a passport for that region
[03:16.940 --> 03:19.240]  and then you can also get like a little coupon book
[03:19.240 --> 03:21.860]  so you could go to like different places and they'll stamp it for you.
[03:22.220 --> 03:24.620]  And you could go around and you could get whatever you wanted on it.
[03:24.620 --> 03:28.580]  We were big in the nickname talk at around the time that this happened.
[03:28.700 --> 03:29.180]  It just started.
[03:29.500 --> 03:31.640]  Geoff was very excited about T-Bone.
[03:32.140 --> 03:37.420]  So I got Geoff a T-Bone Conk Republic passport that they send and like verify.
[03:37.480 --> 03:40.160]  I haven't seen what it looks like, but I'm assuming it looked good.
[03:40.480 --> 03:42.580]  It came out the way I'm taking pictures of it right now.
[03:42.600 --> 03:43.800]  It's fucking gorgeous, dude.
[03:44.660 --> 03:49.260]  Well, so I did that because Geoff was very excited about T-Bone.
[03:49.400 --> 03:52.080]  And then we took a two week break.
[03:52.260 --> 03:54.140]  And when we came back from the break,
[03:54.140 --> 03:58.280]  Geoff introduced himself as Porterhouse on the next podcast.
[03:58.980 --> 04:02.960]  And I was terrified that T-Bone was already dead
[04:02.960 --> 04:06.120]  because it takes six to eight weeks for them to mail this thing out.
[04:06.300 --> 04:07.860]  So I bought it ahead of time.
[04:08.240 --> 04:09.100]  It was all locked in.
[04:09.380 --> 04:11.580]  And he was like, Ned, this week I'm Porterhouse.
[04:11.900 --> 04:14.580]  And I thought he was just going to keep changing nicknames.
[04:14.880 --> 04:19.180]  So quietly, if you go and listen to that with context internally, I'm going,
[04:19.420 --> 04:20.740]  Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
[04:20.760 --> 04:21.880]  He's changed his nickname.
[04:22.140 --> 04:23.120]  T-Bone is gone.
[04:23.120 --> 04:24.320]  T-Bone is dead.
[04:24.500 --> 04:27.440]  But I think externally, you have for some reason just screaming T-Pain.
[04:30.060 --> 04:30.880]  But he kept it.
[04:31.400 --> 04:32.320]  T-Bone alive and well.
[04:33.040 --> 04:33.860]  And I'm trying to find this.
[04:34.820 --> 04:36.320]  I can. I don't like.
[04:37.020 --> 04:38.500]  I don't like Discord.
[04:38.920 --> 04:39.280]  What do you mean?
[04:39.680 --> 04:40.220]  I just don't like it.
[04:40.220 --> 04:41.760]  Trying to figure out where to post an image?
[04:41.980 --> 04:42.820]  Sucks. Yeah.
[04:43.020 --> 04:43.180]  Big problem.
[04:43.500 --> 04:44.320]  You gotta hit the plus sign.
[04:44.520 --> 04:45.680]  Little plus in the bottom left.
[04:45.840 --> 04:47.420]  No, I know, but it's it's won't.
[04:48.000 --> 04:48.880]  It won't let me add.
[04:49.000 --> 04:50.560]  You know, you have to do a thing where you add.
[04:51.080 --> 04:51.700]  You have to add.
[04:51.700 --> 04:53.460]  It's like it doesn't have all your images.
[04:53.700 --> 04:55.280]  Oh, yeah. Comes in like add more.
[04:55.560 --> 04:58.320]  But the add more options gone all of a sudden.
[04:58.420 --> 04:59.040]  OK, there we go.
[04:59.040 --> 04:59.620]  I can do it this way.
[04:59.800 --> 05:02.820]  As somebody who uses the browser, I don't I don't think I've experienced that.
[05:04.020 --> 05:04.780]  Fair. It is.
[05:04.880 --> 05:05.500]  Contra public.
[05:05.640 --> 05:07.340]  Contra public. Fancy little party passport.
[05:08.560 --> 05:09.220]  Party passport.
[05:09.720 --> 05:10.640]  How gorgeous is that?
[05:11.280 --> 05:11.640]  Beautiful.
[05:12.280 --> 05:13.060]  Hope to use it someday.
[05:13.460 --> 05:16.640]  Oh, man. Speaking of Key West, it's about to be July 4th weekend.
[05:17.760 --> 05:21.360]  That's that's probably some pretty good just I mean, by the time this comes out,
[05:21.360 --> 05:22.160]  I'd be way past that.
[05:22.240 --> 05:26.120]  But just FYI, that's probably some pretty good people watching right there.
[05:26.160 --> 05:27.260]  I didn't even think about that.
[05:27.360 --> 05:30.580]  July 4th weekend is probably like insane down there, right?
[05:32.200 --> 05:35.320]  I imagine it's going to be it's going to be slop o'clock all o'clock.
[05:35.760 --> 05:38.660]  Yeah, I was about to say like an interstellar when they go to that different
[05:38.660 --> 05:40.760]  planet and an hour is like six years.
[05:40.980 --> 05:44.600]  July 4th weekend slop o'clock is just never the entire weekend.
[05:45.000 --> 05:46.200]  It's all slop o'clock.
[05:46.980 --> 05:49.520]  You come back from Key West and all your kids are older than you.
[05:55.150 --> 05:56.730]  It's a slop o'clock experience.
[05:57.550 --> 06:00.310]  Before we started this, we were talking about basketball
[06:00.310 --> 06:03.590]  and I wanted to share something with Gavin.
[06:03.750 --> 06:06.710]  You and Eric, Geoff, might be familiar with.
[06:06.770 --> 06:08.250]  Well, you're definitely familiar with it to an extent.
[06:08.710 --> 06:10.250]  Don't don't reveal any information.
[06:10.750 --> 06:13.390]  Gavin, there is a player that was drafted recently
[06:13.390 --> 06:16.330]  and a post photo of him in the discord.
[06:16.650 --> 06:19.910]  And his name is Grady Dick, which is a great.
[06:20.230 --> 06:21.750]  Oh, yeah. Fantastic name.
[06:21.750 --> 06:25.850]  First of all, second thing, just kind of unrelated to my broader point.
[06:26.770 --> 06:28.990]  What do you think he looks like when you look at Grady Dick?
[06:29.070 --> 06:32.310]  Is there anything that jumps out at you is like, oh, he's this.
[06:34.530 --> 06:36.230]  No, because I have one.
[06:36.530 --> 06:37.450]  It's very distinctive.
[06:37.950 --> 06:43.530]  Whenever I see Grady Dick, I cannot see anything else but the Hamburglar.
[06:43.770 --> 06:49.450]  He looks like the Hamburglar before he started his life of crime.
[06:49.450 --> 06:53.810]  Like if they were going to do like a live action biopic of the Hamburglar,
[06:54.330 --> 06:58.590]  young Grady Dick is Hamburglar, which before the crime started.
[06:59.370 --> 07:00.250]  Which part? Which part?
[07:00.810 --> 07:04.810]  Just his face, his face, his face, his aura.
[07:04.990 --> 07:05.810]  You don't his hair.
[07:06.130 --> 07:08.230]  You don't see Grady Dick and think Hamburglar.
[07:08.390 --> 07:10.170]  You don't think those two photos are the same guy?
[07:11.730 --> 07:15.010]  I it's the same guy who's grown up with a life of crime.
[07:15.410 --> 07:16.730]  This is in 20 years.
[07:16.730 --> 07:20.090]  This is it's like two branching paths.
[07:20.270 --> 07:21.350]  You know? Yeah.
[07:21.530 --> 07:25.790]  If he misses like one too many free throws, we know exactly.
[07:26.570 --> 07:29.850]  If Grady Dick was five, eight, he would be the Hamburglar.
[07:30.670 --> 07:35.250]  Dude, I gotta I gotta admit, he looks shockingly similar to the Hamburglar.
[07:35.570 --> 07:37.030]  That was a morning thought I had.
[07:37.310 --> 07:39.950]  I woke up and thought Grady Dick looks like the Hamburglar.
[07:40.190 --> 07:41.690]  That was the start to my day.
[07:42.550 --> 07:45.150]  That's like saying Ian McKellen looks like Falcor.
[07:45.150 --> 07:46.970]  I mean, well, I just there's not enough.
[07:47.790 --> 07:48.930]  What are you talking about?
[07:49.170 --> 07:50.610]  That might never considered that.
[07:52.130 --> 07:53.810]  Wait, can I see Falcor?
[07:53.990 --> 07:54.730]  I don't know what Falcor looks like.
[07:54.750 --> 07:56.230]  I'm going to get it for you here in just a second.
[07:56.610 --> 08:01.090]  OK, does Ian Mckellen look like Falcor?
[08:02.010 --> 08:04.670]  OK, here, classic Falcor.
[08:06.610 --> 08:07.730]  OK, not bad.
[08:07.910 --> 08:10.390]  OK, I kind of have a nose like Falcor.
[08:10.870 --> 08:13.850]  Hang on, Gavin, you might be right.
[08:13.850 --> 08:17.150]  Oh, no, I think I'm right.
[08:19.590 --> 08:20.950]  That's a great one.
[08:21.090 --> 08:22.110]  That's you nailed it.
[08:22.230 --> 08:24.590]  Yeah. Did you know that he looked like Falcor?
[08:24.690 --> 08:25.770]  Had you thought that before?
[08:26.150 --> 08:27.450]  I just picked two.
[08:27.930 --> 08:31.870]  You could do an Animorphs cover of Ian McKellen, the Falcor,
[08:32.070 --> 08:33.050]  and it would make sense.
[08:33.390 --> 08:35.310]  Oh, dude, you could see it the entire way.
[08:36.550 --> 08:40.070]  Oh, I'm so bummed that that's so similar.
[08:40.910 --> 08:41.750]  Sam knows.
[08:42.330 --> 08:46.850]  Are you saying, Gavin, that there's not enough of of the Hamburglar
[08:46.850 --> 08:49.010]  to identify or compare him to a person?
[08:49.170 --> 08:50.190]  Is that what you're trying to argue?
[08:50.750 --> 08:54.250]  I'm saying that Grady's dick doesn't look anything like the Hamburglar.
[08:55.150 --> 08:56.810]  You don't think they look the same?
[08:57.330 --> 08:59.050]  No. Oh, OK.
[08:59.230 --> 09:00.230]  That's crazy to me.
[09:00.350 --> 09:01.390]  I think they're identical.
[09:02.210 --> 09:03.070]  Grady's dick.
[09:03.550 --> 09:04.270]  Grady's dick.
[09:05.290 --> 09:08.690]  It's a spin off we didn't know we wanted, but it's here.
[09:09.350 --> 09:14.530]  So my question to you, Gavin, is I learned his name and then I thought,
[09:14.630 --> 09:16.370]  what do they do about the Jersey situation?
[09:17.070 --> 09:19.590]  Because it's you put your last name on the jersey.
[09:20.250 --> 09:25.590]  Do you think that it just will say dick or will they try to be like a G dot dick?
[09:25.670 --> 09:28.710]  Like, will they try to style the dick in any way?
[09:29.470 --> 09:30.770]  Yeah, why wouldn't they do?
[09:30.870 --> 09:32.070]  I mean, I mean, it's his name.
[09:32.370 --> 09:33.930]  Because it says dick.
[09:33.970 --> 09:34.810]  What do you think, Gavin?
[09:35.370 --> 09:37.930]  I think just dick. It's not just dick.
[09:38.690 --> 09:42.170]  I thought they're going to do G dot dick to like kind of because, you know,
[09:42.230 --> 09:43.750]  it's not like Grady shit.
[09:43.750 --> 09:45.990]  It's not like dick is a common name.
[09:46.550 --> 09:50.410]  It's got to. Yeah, he can't be the first dick in basketball.
[09:50.930 --> 09:52.050]  Yeah, definitely not.
[09:52.310 --> 09:54.810]  There's dicks all over the place in basketball, I assume.
[09:55.670 --> 09:57.170]  Well, historically. Yeah, sure.
[09:57.230 --> 09:58.170]  So Eric should that.
[09:58.630 --> 09:59.310]  Kansas dick.
[09:59.610 --> 10:01.510]  That makes sense. Kansas dick. That makes sense.
[10:01.570 --> 10:03.390]  I was expecting a G dot dick.
[10:03.790 --> 10:07.510]  What Toronto delivered on is better than I could have ever dreamed.
[10:07.510 --> 10:09.510]  He's the number one dick.
[10:10.570 --> 10:13.130]  Oh, no. He's dick one.
[10:13.330 --> 10:15.290]  I thought they were going to try to cover it a little bit.
[10:15.390 --> 10:16.530]  He's just number one dick.
[10:16.690 --> 10:18.930]  They picked the most phallic number.
[10:19.330 --> 10:22.950]  That is that they picked the most dick number.
[10:23.130 --> 10:25.610]  Yeah, that is a swing double dick and ball.
[10:25.830 --> 10:28.650]  That is a side profile of a pair of balls and a long dick.
[10:28.750 --> 10:32.290]  If the back of the jersey was sponsored by MasterCard, it'd be a real picture.
[10:33.530 --> 10:34.450]  Oh, yeah.
[10:35.210 --> 10:36.630]  What if they did like an eight?
[10:37.310 --> 10:40.450]  They had it below it and the one was coming out of the he's 18.
[10:43.550 --> 10:45.090]  They put the one sideway.
[10:46.670 --> 10:51.390]  Oh, the letters coming out, it'd be great.
[10:52.990 --> 10:53.630]  It's perfect.
[10:54.050 --> 10:56.290]  You guys are so you see the number one dick and he's the Hamburglar,
[10:56.370 --> 10:58.590]  but you didn't see the Hamburglar thing, which is crazy to me.
[10:58.750 --> 10:59.790]  I think most people will.
[11:00.410 --> 11:00.970]  I don't see it.
[11:01.190 --> 11:03.650]  I have a question for you, Gavin, on the subject of the Hamburglar.
[11:04.310 --> 11:07.250]  McDonald's is a is fairly popular in the UK, right?
[11:07.590 --> 11:09.370]  Yeah. And so they have tons of McDonald's.
[11:09.410 --> 11:12.390]  The kids have like birthday parties and stuff at McDonald's there.
[11:12.730 --> 11:14.450]  Yeah, I did as a kid.
[11:14.590 --> 11:14.770]  I had one.
[11:14.890 --> 11:17.890]  So are all of the cast of characters
[11:18.590 --> 11:22.070]  on the roster over there, like the Hamburglar and Grimace
[11:22.070 --> 11:25.930]  and Mayor McCheese and all those people, or do they or do you just like
[11:25.930 --> 11:27.230]  or do you get different characters?
[11:27.970 --> 11:31.130]  No, I think we just had like a Ronald situation.
[11:31.130 --> 11:32.210]  I think they are.
[11:32.390 --> 11:35.350]  They they did like pop up, but I didn't know them by name.
[11:35.690 --> 11:39.050]  I feel like I've heard English people reference the Hamburglar and things,
[11:39.170 --> 11:41.870]  but I don't until I've seen this picture Andrew posted,
[11:41.970 --> 11:43.170]  I don't think I even knew what he looked like.
[11:43.550 --> 11:44.670]  OK, really? Yeah.
[11:45.070 --> 11:49.390]  Well, next time you see Grady Dick, you're somewhere in ESPN is on.
[11:49.870 --> 11:50.550]  Number one to him.
[11:50.930 --> 11:52.830]  What were you talking about last episode, by the way?
[11:52.850 --> 11:54.790]  You said the Titanic was a face.
[11:55.230 --> 11:57.050]  Oh, just the whole event of it happening.
[11:57.130 --> 11:58.930]  I wasn't intended as a real mistake.
[11:59.450 --> 12:00.850]  Oh, crashing of the Titanic
[12:01.870 --> 12:04.010]  or hitting the iceberg on your first voyage.
[12:05.170 --> 12:08.650]  So is that going back to your like things that could like turn right?
[12:08.830 --> 12:09.470]  Problem solved.
[12:09.970 --> 12:11.130]  That would be one. Yeah.
[12:11.170 --> 12:13.390]  I just more meant like it seemed kind of avoidable.
[12:13.470 --> 12:16.630]  But I don't know a lot about the Titanic and why they hit the iceberg.
[12:17.090 --> 12:19.030]  And do you think it went wrong?
[12:19.050 --> 12:20.110]  Because they turned right.
[12:20.190 --> 12:22.970]  Like if they just gone straight into it nose first.
[12:23.250 --> 12:24.450]  Oh, it probably wouldn't have sank.
[12:24.790 --> 12:26.350]  Or they could have turned way earlier.
[12:26.350 --> 12:28.550]  Yeah, or not gone full speed.
[12:29.430 --> 12:33.610]  Huh. Was anybody else surprised by how close to land
[12:33.610 --> 12:35.050]  the Titanic was when it crashed?
[12:35.170 --> 12:36.810]  I thought it was way further out.
[12:37.230 --> 12:38.890]  I mean, it's still hundreds of miles out.
[12:39.110 --> 12:42.810]  Yeah, but I mean, on the map, it's like it's right there next to the
[12:42.810 --> 12:44.650]  the space center of the universe.
[12:44.810 --> 12:46.850]  Yeah, that's right off the coast.
[12:47.450 --> 12:51.470]  I feel like I get burger confidence when I look at maps and like distance,
[12:51.470 --> 12:53.910]  not understanding how far something actually is.
[12:54.370 --> 12:55.970]  It always feels closer than it is.
[12:56.550 --> 12:59.130]  The guy that promised four marathons.
[12:59.310 --> 13:02.290]  Yeah, that was that was peak burger confidence.
[13:02.370 --> 13:03.830]  That was insane.
[13:03.950 --> 13:04.890]  First of all, it was three.
[13:05.150 --> 13:07.010]  Oh, second of all, that was a mistake.
[13:07.270 --> 13:08.730]  That was just a dumb statement to claim.
[13:09.110 --> 13:11.290]  That was I've matured since then.
[13:11.730 --> 13:13.630]  Yeah, I've grown perspective.
[13:14.270 --> 13:15.850]  Now, what is that perspective given you?
[13:15.890 --> 13:16.570]  What has it taught you?
[13:17.630 --> 13:19.810]  That I can't run three marathons or walk.
[13:20.270 --> 13:23.330]  Wow. Oh, yeah.
[13:23.970 --> 13:26.290]  Without training, not with not with that attitude.
[13:26.530 --> 13:28.470]  No way. With training?
[13:28.770 --> 13:30.310]  Yeah. No training. No.
[13:30.590 --> 13:30.870]  Impossible.
[13:30.870 --> 13:34.370]  I mean, training, though, like like having a trainer or just like practicing walking
[13:35.170 --> 13:37.990]  like like practicing long distance walking.
[13:38.050 --> 13:39.610]  Yeah. Building stamina and endurance.
[13:39.770 --> 13:40.430]  And yeah. Yeah.
[13:40.430 --> 13:41.730]  How far could you go now, do you think?
[13:42.090 --> 13:42.990]  I have no idea.
[13:43.210 --> 13:44.690]  Before you like, oh, this sucks. I'm going home.
[13:45.050 --> 13:47.010]  Oh, before I say this sucks.
[13:47.050 --> 13:49.510]  I'm going home two blocks, two blocks.
[13:49.570 --> 13:50.050]  This sucks.
[13:50.730 --> 13:52.150]  And how many blocks in a marathon?
[13:53.170 --> 13:54.690]  Oh, a thousand.
[13:55.830 --> 13:57.150]  How long are the blocks?
[13:58.170 --> 13:59.450]  They're one mile each.
[14:01.130 --> 14:03.190]  This is just a math problem.
[14:03.270 --> 14:07.830]  I feel like I'm Jimmy has 16 apples and is going 52 miles west.
[14:08.710 --> 14:10.270]  How many apples does he have?
[14:11.050 --> 14:12.410]  How many city blocks in a marathon?
[14:12.770 --> 14:16.050]  Five hundred and twenty four point three seven five.
[14:16.690 --> 14:18.730]  Oh, so you're like half a percent in.
[14:19.110 --> 14:20.650]  I don't think there's any city.
[14:20.650 --> 14:22.670]  I want to walk that much blockage for.
[14:23.090 --> 14:26.870]  I don't think there's enough stuff for that many city blocks to be.
[14:26.950 --> 14:29.750]  You don't think New York City has a New York City's fucking packed?
[14:30.110 --> 14:31.490]  Yeah. You're walking Tokyo.
[14:31.790 --> 14:36.130]  No, I'm not saying that there isn't enough space in a city for that.
[14:36.290 --> 14:40.850]  I'm saying for my interest, I wouldn't personally be like by block 200.
[14:41.030 --> 14:44.310]  I'd feel like I probably have seen most of the things I'd want to see.
[14:44.570 --> 14:46.830]  I'd run out of interesting things to look at.
[14:47.250 --> 14:49.150]  I really appreciate your perspective.
[14:49.150 --> 14:53.990]  And what you're saying here, this is I think this is a growth moment for you.
[14:54.070 --> 14:54.810]  I think that's great.
[14:55.150 --> 14:57.330]  I don't want to get too far away from ankle integrity.
[14:57.430 --> 14:59.330]  Geoff, what percent would you say your ankles are at?
[14:59.530 --> 15:01.570]  Oh, man. Oh, no.
[15:01.710 --> 15:04.270]  No. My left ankle is.
[15:05.230 --> 15:06.510]  Hold on, let me readjust.
[15:07.030 --> 15:11.570]  I think it's at like fifty four percent right now.
[15:12.130 --> 15:12.650]  What happened?
[15:13.870 --> 15:16.810]  The gentle ghost made a reappearance.
[15:17.470 --> 15:19.130]  It was not. He's aggressive.
[15:19.470 --> 15:20.990]  He's an aggressive ghost now.
[15:21.930 --> 15:23.510]  We said nothing to do with bicycles.
[15:23.750 --> 15:24.850]  I was walking.
[15:25.430 --> 15:26.430]  Emily and I were walking.
[15:26.770 --> 15:30.190]  We were walking a very boring block around the neighborhood with nothing to look at.
[15:30.970 --> 15:34.290]  It was it was a block like 215 for us.
[15:35.590 --> 15:37.810]  And now we were just walking around the neighborhood.
[15:39.050 --> 15:41.590]  And I had like a sprite in my hand.
[15:41.990 --> 15:43.590]  And I went to it was empty.
[15:43.670 --> 15:46.530]  And I went to throw it in a trash can like one of my neighbor's trash cans on the street.
[15:46.810 --> 15:49.330]  And I just looked at it and the trash can was up.
[15:49.410 --> 15:51.990]  And I just like moved the sprite in that direction.
[15:52.930 --> 15:58.530]  And the ghost slammed into me and just I fell forward
[15:58.530 --> 16:02.570]  into the left and twisted my ankle like a high sprain,
[16:02.950 --> 16:05.370]  like a late late in his career LeBron sprain.
[16:05.650 --> 16:09.030]  And it hurts so bad that I was like.
[16:09.690 --> 16:12.670]  I was like I was like I'm like less.
[16:12.770 --> 16:15.890]  I was a second away from my bone going out of my ankle.
[16:15.890 --> 16:17.510]  I don't know what the fuck happened.
[16:17.770 --> 16:23.370]  It was such force that I like I yelped and then I stood up
[16:23.370 --> 16:26.090]  and Emily looked at me and she was like, what the fuck is wrong with you?
[16:26.250 --> 16:28.370]  And then I had to have her help me home.
[16:28.510 --> 16:33.170]  Like I had to put all my weight on her like a crutch and have her help drag me home.
[16:33.210 --> 16:35.410]  And it was like three quarters of a block.
[16:35.490 --> 16:39.850]  It took like 15 minutes and I couldn't walk for the rest of the day.
[16:39.890 --> 16:41.190]  It was the craziest thing.
[16:41.610 --> 16:43.330]  And I there was no hole in the ground.
[16:43.330 --> 16:46.130]  There was no I didn't step off the curb.
[16:46.250 --> 16:51.290]  It was just on a flat sidewalk and my ankle just collapsed on itself
[16:51.290 --> 16:56.410]  for no reason, and it sprained so goddamn bad.
[16:57.070 --> 17:01.410]  I'm so sorry. Nothing for Sprite trying to get rid of her.
[17:01.570 --> 17:02.650]  Just getting rid of it was empty.
[17:02.990 --> 17:04.950]  It wasn't. I don't even have the extra Sprite weight.
[17:05.070 --> 17:05.610]  It was gone.
[17:05.870 --> 17:09.570]  I think if you're going to fall with a beverage in your hand like a popular soda,
[17:09.670 --> 17:10.950]  I think Sprite is the funniest.
[17:11.390 --> 17:11.790]  Why?
[17:12.410 --> 17:16.370]  It's just something about I was holding a Sprite and then I fell is a lot funnier
[17:16.370 --> 17:19.570]  than I was holding a Coke and I fell or I was holding a Pepsi.
[17:19.730 --> 17:21.070]  And there's something about Sprite.
[17:21.190 --> 17:22.290]  Sprite is a funny word.
[17:22.510 --> 17:23.450]  What about talk to Peppa?
[17:24.130 --> 17:24.790]  That's funny.
[17:24.810 --> 17:25.490]  What's the worst thing that could happen?
[17:25.510 --> 17:25.850]  Because it's a doctor.
[17:27.470 --> 17:31.490]  Are you happy somebody finally made your reference back to you after all these years?
[17:32.570 --> 17:36.050]  I think this is maybe a little local, but I think it would be embarrassing
[17:36.050 --> 17:38.870]  to fall with a Big Red because it's got the name Big Red.
[17:38.870 --> 17:42.450]  But then also, if you spill anything, you're just covered in red,
[17:42.730 --> 17:44.410]  but in like red soda.
[17:45.210 --> 17:46.830]  Yeah, I would hate to follow that.
[17:47.470 --> 17:48.770]  Big Red is really funny, too.
[17:49.150 --> 17:49.970]  It's a great one.
[17:50.390 --> 17:53.710]  I have a I have a science question for you guys.
[17:54.030 --> 17:57.490]  I'm not very science minded, but I had a thought the other day that I'm.
[17:58.330 --> 17:59.530]  I'd like to run by you.
[17:59.650 --> 18:01.130]  I'm curious if this would work.
[18:01.490 --> 18:03.010]  You guys had like boba tea.
[18:03.710 --> 18:03.990]  Mm hmm.
[18:04.070 --> 18:04.990]  Oh, it's a little bubbles.
[18:05.470 --> 18:06.830]  Yeah, you get the little balls in them.
[18:06.930 --> 18:07.910]  Have you tried that game?
[18:07.910 --> 18:09.410]  Yeah, it's absolutely foul.
[18:09.750 --> 18:11.530]  Worst texture in liquid of all time.
[18:12.010 --> 18:12.910]  Oh, you don't like it?
[18:13.030 --> 18:14.810]  No, I don't like the little little flavor.
[18:15.110 --> 18:15.470]  Disgusting.
[18:15.890 --> 18:16.890]  Thanks. Wow.
[18:17.170 --> 18:17.990]  You hate it, too, Geoff?
[18:18.090 --> 18:18.750]  Can't stand it.
[18:19.010 --> 18:21.630]  Wow. OK, meet me and Nick are all on board for this.
[18:21.670 --> 18:22.410]  So you can keep it going.
[18:22.890 --> 18:24.170]  No, Nick. Nick likes a food.
[18:24.330 --> 18:26.510]  Wow. This actually honestly.
[18:26.530 --> 18:27.670]  Yeah, get him, get him, get him.
[18:30.190 --> 18:33.570]  Geoff and Gavin might actually be the perfect people to run this scenario by
[18:33.570 --> 18:34.210]  in my head.
[18:34.210 --> 18:35.350]  So I was thinking
[18:36.470 --> 18:38.930]  I had, which is dangerous.
[18:39.530 --> 18:43.870]  I had a drink that like contained kind of similar product to it.
[18:44.290 --> 18:48.790]  And I noticed that the ball went through my system
[18:48.790 --> 18:50.510]  and made it intact.
[18:50.730 --> 18:54.030]  Come on. And it still worked like it was still intact.
[18:54.570 --> 18:58.710]  So I thought, well, I mean, like it was still poppable, I guess.
[18:58.770 --> 19:00.550]  Like it didn't it didn't break down.
[19:00.990 --> 19:04.130]  God. Oh, so I had a thought of let's say
[19:04.130 --> 19:07.530]  you had like two liters of boba balls, right?
[19:08.250 --> 19:10.050]  And you drank all of them.
[19:10.410 --> 19:13.950]  And then you got someone like this is just the first guy
[19:13.950 --> 19:15.230]  I think of with like strong legs.
[19:15.330 --> 19:19.170]  You got like Mirko Cro Cop, who is like known for kicking really hard.
[19:19.550 --> 19:23.810]  If you drank a bunch of boba balls and then Mirko Cro Cop
[19:23.810 --> 19:27.690]  kicked you in the stomach, could it pop the balls and you taste the flavor?
[19:28.130 --> 19:29.890]  Can you get the flavor of the balls through?
[19:30.170 --> 19:31.990]  Why do you think you'd be able to taste with your stomach?
[19:31.990 --> 19:35.750]  Because there are taste receptors all throughout your gut.
[19:35.990 --> 19:39.730]  I mean, we taste we tasted with our feet. That worked. Yeah.
[19:40.610 --> 19:42.470]  I'm pretty sure. I mean, you can look that up.
[19:42.550 --> 19:43.470]  I'm not a science man.
[19:43.930 --> 19:48.250]  I'm just it's a thought I had of how funny it would be to like,
[19:48.350 --> 19:52.210]  I don't get kicked really hard or maybe like you hit your steering wheel
[19:52.210 --> 19:54.970]  in a car accident and you taste like flavor.
[19:55.170 --> 19:57.290]  You get orange, you get orange taste.
[19:58.550 --> 19:59.470]  Oh, here we go.
[19:59.470 --> 20:02.170]  Eric said, uh, you want to read that, Gavin?
[20:02.910 --> 20:04.230]  I think Eric should read that.
[20:05.190 --> 20:08.470]  Endocrine cells, orange comet shaped cells in the gut,
[20:08.690 --> 20:12.450]  villi have functional, sweet and bitter taste receptors.
[20:12.510 --> 20:17.130]  Not shown this. There's an image here at their epic
[20:17.890 --> 20:19.850]  apical. Damn it. This is where I lost it.
[20:19.990 --> 20:24.530]  Apical, apical, luminal membranes, sugar membranes.
[20:24.850 --> 20:26.730]  Here we go. Sugar. See, Geoff should have read it.
[20:26.730 --> 20:31.250]  Sugars and other nutrients within the gut lumen activate
[20:31.250 --> 20:37.710]  the gut taste receptors, leading to release of endocrine cell hormones.
[20:37.970 --> 20:43.190]  So the same test taste receptors lining the tongue and palate
[20:43.190 --> 20:47.270]  also occur in the stomach, intestines and other internal organs.
[20:49.210 --> 20:49.890]  Enteroendocrine.
[20:50.710 --> 20:55.110]  You know what you could do if you were a if you were a, I think it would work,
[20:55.110 --> 20:57.170]  but B, you know what I think you could you could have.
[20:57.310 --> 21:00.230]  There's a different use for that if you were a spy, right? OK.
[21:01.090 --> 21:04.570]  You know how like back in the 50s and the 60s, spies would have like
[21:04.570 --> 21:09.830]  they would have a false tooth that would have a poison cyanide pill in it, right?
[21:10.170 --> 21:11.610]  What if you as a spy,
[21:12.470 --> 21:16.770]  you just started ingesting spy filled boba tea all the time
[21:17.310 --> 21:20.470]  and then nothing happens to you, you just shit it out.
[21:20.530 --> 21:21.590]  You're fine. No problem.
[21:21.830 --> 21:24.410]  But on the day you get captured, if they catch you unaware,
[21:24.410 --> 21:27.970]  as long as you've got those boba balls in you, if things are looking grim,
[21:28.310 --> 21:30.410]  you can instigate a fight with your captor or whatever.
[21:30.630 --> 21:33.930]  As soon as they try to torture you and they punch you really hard in the stomach,
[21:34.030 --> 21:35.450]  they kill you. You're dead.
[21:35.710 --> 21:37.790]  Mission accomplished. And they don't get the secrets.
[21:38.350 --> 21:39.930]  That's a genius idea, Geoff.
[21:39.950 --> 21:44.370]  I was thinking more of a game show like maybe like a millionaire.
[21:44.870 --> 21:48.210]  But instead of trivia, you need to accurately describe
[21:48.210 --> 21:50.190]  the flavor that's inside of you.
[21:50.390 --> 21:52.390]  It's like somebody would kick you really hard.
[21:52.390 --> 21:53.790]  And if you're accurate, if you're like,
[21:54.030 --> 21:56.750]  hmm, that's that's honeydew is what I had.
[21:56.870 --> 21:58.390]  Yeah. Then you go on to the next round.
[21:58.670 --> 22:00.970]  It's called kick taste. It's a great kick taste.
[22:01.070 --> 22:02.490]  It's a great new they say.
[22:02.550 --> 22:06.510]  That's what you know, like WWE has their own
[22:07.910 --> 22:11.890]  platform and their own app and their own programming, their own OTT or VOD.
[22:12.870 --> 22:14.910]  There should be something for UFC like that.
[22:14.910 --> 22:18.250]  Like they've already tried to expand with that really bizarre slap fighting.
[22:18.430 --> 22:21.510]  Yeah, that's a show which I could not get behind or get into.
[22:21.510 --> 22:23.570]  But what if they start to do stuff like this?
[22:23.650 --> 22:27.990]  They start to have like UFC game shows like Taste the Kick and things like that.
[22:28.090 --> 22:30.010]  Yeah, that could be it could be a whole new avenue for that.
[22:30.290 --> 22:31.870]  For it would be like their XFL.
[22:32.210 --> 22:33.330]  Yeah, like that's great.
[22:33.510 --> 22:36.730]  They must register different flavors, though, because if my gut
[22:36.730 --> 22:38.770]  ever comes back into my mouth, it tastes awful.
[22:39.270 --> 22:41.230]  And I feel like I'm not constantly tasting vomit.
[22:41.830 --> 22:45.070]  Gus always talks about that one time that he got he got
[22:45.670 --> 22:47.990]  food poisoning after eating Rudy's barbecue.
[22:48.370 --> 22:50.450]  And then the next day he threw up Rudy's barbecue
[22:50.450 --> 22:52.570]  and he said it was the best tasting vomit of his life.
[22:53.110 --> 22:55.090]  Yeah. And he like shit a bean out of his nose.
[22:55.250 --> 22:58.130]  Yeah. And he said it was like it was it was confusing to him
[22:58.130 --> 22:59.530]  because it tasted good.
[22:59.750 --> 23:00.510]  I've done the same.
[23:00.870 --> 23:02.630]  Oh, I actually threw up.
[23:02.690 --> 23:03.990]  I threw up Rudy's at your house, Geoff.
[23:04.970 --> 23:05.630]  Did you really?
[23:06.470 --> 23:07.690]  No, I don't know. Probably.
[23:08.910 --> 23:10.050]  Probably 15 years ago.
[23:10.370 --> 23:10.950]  Oh, OK.
[23:11.610 --> 23:14.870]  Oh, in an earlier episode, by the way, I said that you stopped playing Fallout
[23:14.870 --> 23:17.130]  in 2007, but it was it was 2009.
[23:17.530 --> 23:18.650]  Oh, I got the trip wrong.
[23:18.650 --> 23:20.730]  You guys really don't like boba, huh?
[23:20.970 --> 23:23.170]  No. I like the fat.
[23:23.450 --> 23:24.590]  I mean, how much do you like it?
[23:24.630 --> 23:25.130]  Would you like
[23:26.790 --> 23:28.630]  would you like like a boba steak?
[23:29.110 --> 23:30.130]  Well, how would that work?
[23:30.310 --> 23:31.670]  Yeah, I was going to play with a knife.
[23:31.790 --> 23:32.630]  What does that mean?
[23:32.710 --> 23:33.610]  What does that mean?
[23:34.010 --> 23:35.050]  Like a slab of it.
[23:35.690 --> 23:37.150]  But I don't know what that means.
[23:38.070 --> 23:41.970]  Like you swallowed the drink and it just is you taste you pop the bubbles.
[23:42.430 --> 23:45.170]  You cut into a steak like it immediately the bubble pops.
[23:45.450 --> 23:47.210]  Do you want like a steak full like Orbeez?
[23:47.210 --> 23:49.010]  Like, is that what you're like?
[23:49.650 --> 23:50.730]  Well, what's in the bowl?
[23:51.790 --> 23:53.310]  Uh, I don't know.
[23:53.750 --> 23:54.630]  Here here's the thing.
[23:54.790 --> 23:58.650]  When I think about it too much, I think that they look like little dog eyes.
[23:59.350 --> 24:00.810]  Oh, and I don't like that.
[24:00.930 --> 24:01.950]  I don't like that.
[24:02.210 --> 24:03.170]  But that's not what it is.
[24:03.190 --> 24:04.230]  It's just tapioca.
[24:04.690 --> 24:05.210]  But like what?
[24:05.330 --> 24:06.110]  I thought it was solid.
[24:06.610 --> 24:07.370]  I didn't know that I had it.
[24:07.530 --> 24:08.890]  I didn't know they had like a filling.
[24:09.410 --> 24:09.990]  What are you talking?
[24:10.430 --> 24:11.190]  What? Boba?
[24:11.310 --> 24:12.250]  Have you had boba?
[24:12.490 --> 24:13.470]  Everything has a filling.
[24:13.850 --> 24:15.650]  It's not like it's like a filled.
[24:15.870 --> 24:16.690]  It's like tapioca.
[24:16.690 --> 24:18.270]  Yeah, it's chewy tapioca.
[24:18.390 --> 24:18.990]  It's fucking gross.
[24:19.130 --> 24:20.330]  The whole thing is one thing, right?
[24:20.510 --> 24:21.770]  There's not like an internal piece.
[24:23.250 --> 24:25.230]  I guess. I guess not.
[24:25.330 --> 24:25.730]  I don't know.
[24:25.850 --> 24:27.650]  It's not like somebody fills it with something.
[24:27.830 --> 24:29.570]  What is a dog's eyeball made up of?
[24:29.630 --> 24:31.230]  There's probably veins and shit in there.
[24:31.530 --> 24:33.490]  There's probably things inside of a dog's eyeball.
[24:33.490 --> 24:37.510]  What I'm saying is that's what I understand about the whole like getting punched in it, releasing the thing.
[24:37.630 --> 24:38.710]  It's the thing already.
[24:39.090 --> 24:43.930]  Right. But I think that if you get punched and they're easily ruptured,
[24:43.930 --> 24:47.270]  I think you'll be tasting more of it in a different way.
[24:47.290 --> 24:52.350]  Well, and I think what Andrew was saying as well is maybe you could inject something, a different flavor into the tapioca ball.
[24:52.690 --> 24:52.790]  Honeydew.
[24:53.010 --> 24:53.910]  Like honeydew or whatever.
[24:54.270 --> 24:54.610]  Oh, OK.
[24:54.870 --> 24:56.530]  Yeah. This is like a mechanism of delivery.
[24:56.910 --> 24:58.670]  Yeah. Or whatever a dog's eyeball tastes like.
[24:58.790 --> 25:07.150]  Yeah. I mean, can I ask what does Grady Dick look more like the Hamburglar or do the boba balls look more like dog's eyes to you, Gavin?
[25:07.330 --> 25:09.070]  I'd say the boba balls look like dog eyes.
[25:09.290 --> 25:11.370]  You think they look like Lil Hobbs eyes?
[25:11.570 --> 25:13.110]  They do. I mean, poor Lil Hobbs.
[25:13.110 --> 25:14.310]  He's got little boba eyes.
[25:15.810 --> 25:19.470]  In fact, if you if you see that picture of the orange drink.
[25:20.250 --> 25:21.390]  Yeah. The bottom right.
[25:21.990 --> 25:24.750]  There's like three. There's like two eyes and a nose below it.
[25:24.890 --> 25:26.010]  It makes a little Hobbs.
[25:26.390 --> 25:28.050]  It's Lil Hobbs in there.
[25:29.270 --> 25:30.670]  That's the essence of Hobbs.
[25:33.850 --> 25:35.930]  Poor Lil Hobbs. He's inside the drink.
[25:36.310 --> 25:37.290]  Get out of there, little buddy.
[25:39.190 --> 25:41.250]  Hey, I got a question for you guys.
[25:41.250 --> 25:43.210]  OK, that's kind of related to this.
[25:43.510 --> 25:46.310]  It was my morning. It was my morning thought today, actually.
[25:47.930 --> 25:50.730]  What what what happened to Silly Straws?
[25:51.470 --> 25:52.830]  Like Curly Wurly Straws?
[25:52.930 --> 25:55.590]  Yeah, well, that's not what we called them in America, but I love that.
[25:55.670 --> 25:57.110]  That's what you called them in the UK, I'm assuming.
[25:58.070 --> 26:02.290]  I feel like they were everywhere for most of my life and my childhood, and they were always fun.
[26:02.330 --> 26:04.550]  And I just feel like we got away from Silly Straws.
[26:04.810 --> 26:05.390]  Hard to clean.
[26:05.770 --> 26:09.030]  Maybe we should pivot back to Silly Straws.
[26:09.030 --> 26:13.070]  Would you enjoy a drink more if you had to suck it through the entire face logo?
[26:13.390 --> 26:15.750]  Yes. Yes, I would.
[26:15.990 --> 26:18.670]  Yes, I would. Because I think I would.
[26:19.070 --> 26:22.510]  I just like written out like a neon sign.
[26:25.830 --> 26:27.490]  That would be so big.
[26:28.130 --> 26:30.990]  I just feel like the world was a happier place.
[26:31.230 --> 26:37.630]  The world was a happier place when people used to imagine being in like a park
[26:37.630 --> 26:41.210]  and seeing somebody drink with a giant f***ing face.
[26:41.530 --> 26:43.750]  Hey, I'm just drinking through my favorite podcast.
[26:46.830 --> 26:49.930]  The straw would contain more liquid than the drink.
[26:50.330 --> 26:51.300]  I wonder if you could...
[26:52.130 --> 26:54.750]  If you sucked up, it would all be in the straw.
[26:55.030 --> 26:59.400]  Yeah, I wonder if you had a full Gerpler, how much of the Gerpler...
[27:00.550 --> 27:03.410]  How much would be in the cup by the time some of it is touching your mouth?
[27:03.650 --> 27:07.510]  Right, like, could you empty the cup before you get any in your mouth?
[27:08.330 --> 27:08.830]  But...
[27:11.030 --> 27:15.850]  Can you imagine how psychotic you would look in a public space
[27:15.850 --> 27:19.370]  with a Gerpler and this giant f***ing face straw?
[27:19.950 --> 27:22.230]  You would have to sell it with like a flushing tool.
[27:22.790 --> 27:23.670]  Oh, my God.
[27:23.890 --> 27:26.510]  I tell you what, you'd make an entrance on that scene. Yeah.
[27:28.150 --> 27:31.330]  I I looked up custom silly straws just to see.
[27:31.690 --> 27:37.010]  Custom is not super long of a word and doesn't look like a show logo,
[27:37.010 --> 27:39.970]  but look at how many curves and turns are in there.
[27:40.630 --> 27:41.730]  Oh, my God.
[27:41.950 --> 27:44.670]  That is half a bottle in there. Absolutely.
[27:45.410 --> 27:50.770]  If we do a Gerpler one, we need to have a wider, like a bigger, a lower gauge straw.
[27:51.370 --> 27:55.330]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. We need to we need like a thick straw that would be able to suck up boba.
[27:55.910 --> 27:58.070]  We're going to have to add two more letters to that.
[27:58.770 --> 28:00.330]  Yeah, that's only six letters custom.
[28:00.750 --> 28:02.650]  And I think that has to be stacked.
[28:02.990 --> 28:03.610]  It's got to be stacked.
[28:03.810 --> 28:05.410]  It's got to be a little like a logo face. Yeah.
[28:05.410 --> 28:10.130]  Yeah, we should make these because whenever we sell like a drinks based receptacle,
[28:10.270 --> 28:11.050]  it always goes really well.
[28:11.210 --> 28:16.290]  All right. Let me let me throw it into the merch slack. Hang on.
[28:21.170 --> 28:23.270]  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[28:23.790 --> 28:27.810]  There are times, especially growing up where it's just so difficult
[28:27.810 --> 28:31.890]  to decide what direction you want to go in, whether it's career or personal life
[28:31.890 --> 28:34.730]  and especially like in the context of career,
[28:35.290 --> 28:39.250]  figuring out what ultimately is satisfying to you is a constant process.
[28:39.450 --> 28:42.610]  And maybe something that is beneficial to you now won't always be.
[28:42.710 --> 28:46.910]  You just, in my experience, have to try stuff and learn from those experiences
[28:46.910 --> 28:47.650]  that you have.
[28:48.050 --> 28:50.050]  And sometimes in life, we're faced with tough choices
[28:50.050 --> 28:53.010]  and the path forward isn't always clear, even when it is clear.
[28:53.050 --> 28:53.930]  It isn't always easy.
[28:54.230 --> 28:58.550]  You know, it's kind of a great aspect of therapy and being able to talk to someone.
[28:58.930 --> 29:02.810]  Whether you're dealing with decisions around career relationships or anything else,
[29:02.810 --> 29:06.170]  therapy helps you stay connected to what you really want while you navigate life
[29:06.170 --> 29:08.850]  so you can move forward with confidence and excitement.
[29:09.190 --> 29:12.430]  Trusting yourself to make decisions that align with your values is like anything.
[29:12.690 --> 29:14.650]  The more you practice it, the easier it gets.
[29:15.030 --> 29:17.710]  Therapy is a wonderful process to go through.
[29:17.890 --> 29:22.570]  It is something that has greatly impacted my life and in countless beneficial ways.
[29:23.290 --> 29:25.030]  It's a process I still engage in.
[29:25.630 --> 29:28.650]  It's, in my experience, extremely beneficial.
[29:29.070 --> 29:31.950]  So if you're thinking of starting therapy, give BetterHelp a try.

[31:28.510 --> 31:36.110]  Speaking of merch, I had an idea, I had a uniform idea that just struck me the other day. I wanted to run by you guys.
[31:36.270 --> 31:36.750]  Ooh, okay.
[31:36.850 --> 31:42.110]  And see if this is a direction I should go into in terms of invention. I know Gavin, you're about to get to work on your thing.
[31:42.710 --> 31:45.850]  Uh, you ever look at a fork?
[31:48.170 --> 31:48.530]  Yeah.
[31:48.990 --> 31:49.770]  Most days, yeah.
[31:50.090 --> 31:52.830]  Yeah. What does a fork look like to you?
[31:54.610 --> 31:58.430]  Uh, it's uh, it's four toothpicks or three toothpicks.
[31:58.450 --> 32:02.130]  Oh my god, are you serious? I was just about to say it's like four toothpicks.
[32:02.650 --> 32:04.670]  Yeah, well that's what it looks like, so it makes sense.
[32:04.710 --> 32:05.990]  I guess that's true, but it's not a phrase.
[32:06.570 --> 32:09.450]  Uh, that's not where we're going with this. If I look at a fork,
[32:10.590 --> 32:13.850]  what I like, what I think it looks like is it looks like my hand.
[32:14.230 --> 32:19.770]  It looks like my hand from my elbow to, like this is a, hold on, so I'm gonna take a photo.
[32:20.110 --> 32:20.350]  Okay.
[32:20.550 --> 32:22.530]  No, I can kind of see where you're looking at my hand right now, I can see.
[32:22.530 --> 32:24.310]  Oh, so you like tuck the thumb in and you've just got like a fork?
[32:24.450 --> 32:25.870]  Yeah, I can see what you mean.
[32:26.010 --> 32:36.510]  Here's a perfect example, if, I feel like you're about to Steve Jobs us and be like, we don't need a, we don't need forks, we have five of them in our hands.
[32:36.510 --> 32:48.730]  Well, I just, I was thinking the other day about, uh, about how, uh, if you, if you think about it, we invented the fork, like, I think around a thousand B.C. in Venice, right?
[32:48.990 --> 32:53.770]  And people have been using forks ever since, but we haven't really done much with them since that moment.
[32:55.190 --> 32:56.430]  Not a lot of innovation.
[32:56.650 --> 32:59.190]  Not a lot of, not a lot of fork innovation.
[32:59.690 --> 33:05.030]  They've tried the spork, that's probably the last innovation I'd say in that, that space, but that, that didn't catch on.
[33:05.290 --> 33:05.470]  No.
[33:05.470 --> 33:07.090]  Some people like it, some people don't.
[33:08.130 --> 33:09.390]  Not widely available.
[33:09.750 --> 33:21.050]  I hate how fucking hard it is to send a fucking photo to this fucking Discord for my fucking podcast.
[33:21.330 --> 33:23.550]  I was just going to show you my stupid hand.
[33:24.250 --> 33:25.050]  Okay, well, I can imagine.
[33:25.050 --> 33:27.610]  It's not important at all, just imagine, if you will, my hand.
[33:28.190 --> 33:29.510]  No, I want to see it.
[33:29.790 --> 33:31.050]  No, yeah, you got to show it to us.
[33:31.410 --> 33:33.730]  Well, ignore how much it was built up because of shitty Discord.
[33:34.210 --> 33:35.370]  All right, well, I won't.
[33:35.590 --> 33:37.010]  Take a break and then I'll...
[33:37.010 --> 33:38.250]  Okay, browse, no.
[33:38.310 --> 33:39.050]  No, all this stays in.
[33:40.350 --> 33:41.970]  Why is this so hard?
[33:42.110 --> 33:46.410]  I want people to know how much, I want other people to start hating Discord as much as I hate it.
[33:46.450 --> 33:46.990]  I hate Discord.
[33:47.370 --> 33:49.050]  I don't actually, it's easy with the app.
[33:49.330 --> 33:50.650]  You're trying to send a photo through the app?
[33:52.130 --> 33:53.130]  He's probably using his phone.
[33:53.470 --> 33:54.690]  I'm using my phone, I'm using my phone.
[33:54.730 --> 33:56.690]  Yeah, but use the phone app.
[33:57.870 --> 33:58.750]  Download the app for that.
[33:59.550 --> 34:00.730]  Let me see if I can do it this way.
[34:01.070 --> 34:01.190]  Discord.
[34:01.190 --> 34:01.630]  Makes it easy.
[34:01.870 --> 34:02.570]  Copy photo.
[34:02.570 --> 34:03.810]  Can I just fucking paste?
[34:04.990 --> 34:07.530]  Are you trying to use the Discord browser through the phone?
[34:07.530 --> 34:08.430]  Oh yeah, there we go.
[34:08.790 --> 34:09.090]  Okay.
[34:09.890 --> 34:10.610]  Okay, yeah.
[34:11.390 --> 34:12.350]  Thumb tucked in.
[34:12.470 --> 34:13.410]  This was so worth it.
[34:13.490 --> 34:14.510]  Yeah, it's so worth it, right?
[34:14.830 --> 34:15.370]  That fucking photo.
[34:15.590 --> 34:16.430]  That's a fork, right?
[34:16.730 --> 34:17.170]  Yeah.
[34:17.590 --> 34:17.970]  Yeah.
[34:18.090 --> 34:19.790]  So we already have forks.
[34:20.370 --> 34:23.490]  Like, God or whoever gave them to us.
[34:23.890 --> 34:26.710]  Or natural selection created forks, right?
[34:27.550 --> 34:29.630]  Created, we have a fork on each arm.
[34:29.630 --> 34:36.990]  Uh, but we have a better version of a fork because we have a thumb, right?
[34:38.050 --> 34:44.170]  Like, we have naturally improved upon the fork by virtue of having a thumb.
[34:44.850 --> 34:48.310]  So why don't forks have thumbs?
[34:48.870 --> 34:52.830]  If we could add a thumb to all forks, could we make forks better?
[34:53.870 --> 34:58.810]  I love it when I'm eating a load of steak and then the thumb of the fork hooks on the side of my lip.
[34:58.810 --> 34:59.890]  I mean, I don't know.
[35:00.470 --> 35:03.810]  Does that do the other, do the finger tines ever hook on you in any way?
[35:05.630 --> 35:06.070]  Oh!
[35:08.890 --> 35:10.330]  Oh, that's nice and tucked in.
[35:10.590 --> 35:12.030]  Yeah, that's nice.
[35:12.190 --> 35:17.050]  Eric found some sort of a wooden spaghetti fork spoon at hand.
[35:17.150 --> 35:21.270]  A wooden spaghetti fork spoon is what I found.
[35:22.570 --> 35:23.410]  That's nice.
[35:23.470 --> 35:24.490]  That's what I'm talking about.
[35:24.710 --> 35:28.790]  But what would the beauty of the thumb is that you can sort of maneuver it.
[35:28.810 --> 35:32.050]  What does a fixed thumb get you on a fork?
[35:32.150 --> 35:34.210]  The same thing that other fixed tines get you.
[35:35.930 --> 35:36.130]  Right.
[35:36.510 --> 35:38.270]  So what, do you just want a five tine fork?
[35:38.290 --> 35:42.570]  It gives you a little... here's the thing, I don't know.
[35:42.930 --> 35:43.230]  Because I haven't tried it yet.
[35:43.230 --> 35:46.810]  Like a little catchment area so the food doesn't slip down?
[35:46.850 --> 35:48.690]  Yeah, I'm working on a theory here.
[35:49.310 --> 35:56.090]  By looking at like, if you boil a fork down to what it is and you boil a hand down to what it is,
[35:56.090 --> 36:03.390]  they're almost identical, but one is better because it has an extra digit in a different place.
[36:03.510 --> 36:05.450]  And I just feel like, I don't know that it's better.
[36:05.670 --> 36:08.430]  I just have a feeling that if I were to invent it and I were to start to use it,
[36:08.490 --> 36:10.890]  I would find, I would go like, oh, this makes so much more sense.
[36:11.530 --> 36:16.190]  I feel like you're getting some of the benefits of a fork and a spoon at the same time
[36:16.190 --> 36:18.650]  without having an ugly spork, which is useless.
[36:18.950 --> 36:23.030]  And maybe it would... maybe it would cradle your mouth a little.
[36:23.550 --> 36:25.190]  I think, I think you're onto something.
[36:25.190 --> 36:28.510]  Potentially, I think there's definitely work to do in the lab for you.
[36:28.670 --> 36:30.490]  I don't want it to look like a hand, though.
[36:31.010 --> 36:34.570]  I don't want to have to imagine that I'm sucking food off of some fingers
[36:34.570 --> 36:38.890]  every time I'm using the product, which is looking at that spaghetti
[36:39.630 --> 36:42.830]  hand thing that Eric posted is all I can think about.
[36:42.910 --> 36:45.610]  I don't want to suck off a thumb to get my fucking spaghetti.
[36:46.230 --> 36:47.490]  See, I have no problem with that.
[36:47.570 --> 36:51.590]  I feel like a lot of the time as well, when I eat,
[36:51.770 --> 36:54.870]  I'm trying to get a bite of everything on the plate on the same fork.
[36:55.590 --> 36:58.570]  I'm not a freak like, was it, Nick, who just eats the ingredients
[36:58.570 --> 37:00.270]  and like works his way through the whole thing.
[37:00.290 --> 37:01.110]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, he'll do that.
[37:01.610 --> 37:04.930]  Like, if I'm eating like steak and potato and maybe some fruit
[37:04.930 --> 37:07.370]  or like some veg on the side, I want a little bit of all of it.
[37:07.430 --> 37:10.950]  And sometimes if you've put the potato on and you've put the meat on,
[37:11.010 --> 37:14.150]  it's very hard to like get a tomato or something, you know, because you crush it.
[37:14.690 --> 37:19.250]  But the thumb would help pierce a little cherry tomato
[37:20.570 --> 37:24.870]  and it would be really good for getting all the different bites on the same bite.
[37:25.190 --> 37:28.170]  It's like it's a flavor enhancer is what it is.
[37:28.410 --> 37:31.330]  It allows you to get that one extra component on your fork.
[37:31.670 --> 37:35.610]  Yeah, the crushable component that fires off your plate if you squash it with meat.
[37:36.010 --> 37:39.290]  Now, before we get too far away, we just need to talk about the fact
[37:39.290 --> 37:44.830]  that Gavin in an isolated thing, I said that I do not want to suck off a thumb for spaghetti.
[37:45.170 --> 37:47.990]  And then Gavin said, well, that's what I like about it.
[37:48.350 --> 37:50.050]  You said something along the lines of supporting it
[37:50.050 --> 37:53.750]  and then ended your statement with Nick is a freak, which is great.
[37:53.750 --> 37:56.390]  The same both things can be.
[37:56.390 --> 38:01.110]  You were you were agreeing with Geoff's point of like having more prongs or whatever.
[38:01.110 --> 38:02.790]  But I said, I don't want to suck off a thumb.
[38:02.830 --> 38:03.970]  And you said, well, I do.
[38:04.110 --> 38:06.330]  That's what I like about this process.
[38:06.410 --> 38:08.910]  I'm saying the wooden one, the wooden one doesn't bother me.
[38:08.950 --> 38:10.770]  It doesn't they've got no problem with it.
[38:11.370 --> 38:13.730]  How like there's a knife or a spoon need a thumb.
[38:15.630 --> 38:16.350]  That's interesting.
[38:16.390 --> 38:17.130]  A knife thumb.
[38:17.450 --> 38:22.750]  Like if a spoon had a thumb, you could potentially open a yogurt lid with it.
[38:23.750 --> 38:25.950]  I wonder why we don't have fork knives.
[38:26.350 --> 38:30.850]  I think you would cut your mouth where you have like where you have like four knives in a row.
[38:31.370 --> 38:32.630]  No, just to help you cut more.
[38:32.910 --> 38:35.130]  Like imagine if they were spaced a little bit further apart
[38:35.130 --> 38:37.750]  and you wanted to cut your steak, you could cut four pieces at once.
[38:38.250 --> 38:41.350]  Do you think, Geoff, that your background is Wolverine
[38:41.350 --> 38:43.290]  makes you think about your hands as tools?
[38:43.510 --> 38:45.030]  I might. It absolutely might.
[38:45.090 --> 38:46.470]  That might be part of what part of this.
[38:46.650 --> 38:48.990]  But I bet that but I have to draw on my experience, right?
[38:49.670 --> 38:51.050]  Did Wolverine ever eat office clothes?
[38:51.990 --> 38:52.350]  Absolutely.
[38:52.350 --> 38:54.070]  He must have at some point.
[38:54.950 --> 38:59.550]  Before we get too far from the fork, I've been looking into
[39:00.190 --> 39:02.690]  what exactly it is and why it was created.
[39:03.450 --> 39:10.750]  This guy, Kisuke Tsubaki Moto.
[39:10.950 --> 39:11.350]  Nailed it.
[39:11.570 --> 39:15.810]  I think. One second place in a Japanese design contest
[39:15.810 --> 39:22.730]  where he won $5,000 creating this fork with a thumb.
[39:23.070 --> 39:26.510]  And when I put his stuff into Google Translate for what this is,
[39:26.570 --> 39:29.630]  a fork with the kindness and warmth of a thumb.
[39:29.910 --> 39:33.610]  You can enjoy your meal and you can support the food you put on it.
[39:33.910 --> 39:37.490]  In modern times, it is easy to forget that food is grown,
[39:37.690 --> 39:40.070]  transported and prepared by humans in cities
[39:40.070 --> 39:42.330]  where it is difficult to see human involvement.
[39:42.330 --> 39:48.250]  This fork gently teaches us that food culture is supported by human hands through eating.
[39:48.970 --> 39:53.790]  If you can live your diet as a consumer, not just a consumer,
[39:54.190 --> 39:57.890]  you will be able to enjoy your daily life more deeply.
[39:58.290 --> 40:00.450]  Geoff, do you think that's what you were getting at?
[40:00.450 --> 40:03.470]  Eric, I feel like that's what I said almost verbatim.
[40:05.290 --> 40:06.370]  There you have it.
[40:06.370 --> 40:12.570]  If you had two of those hand forks and you sort of turn them thumb inwards,
[40:12.890 --> 40:14.690]  could you use the two thumbs as chopsticks?
[40:22.610 --> 40:27.350]  Wolverine at a cookout with like hot dogs and steak.
[40:28.330 --> 40:31.430]  He turned his claws into shish kebabs, essentially.
[40:31.710 --> 40:35.710]  Imagine like the opening or ending of a Fast and Furious film, but Wolverine is there.
[40:36.370 --> 40:38.050]  And the whole barbecue is on his hands.
[40:38.410 --> 40:40.790]  He's got shrimp. He's got sausages.
[40:42.150 --> 40:46.370]  I think what that guy said is interesting of thinking about
[40:46.370 --> 40:48.890]  your fingers as having personalities.
[40:49.230 --> 40:51.590]  Oh, Eric, corn on the claws.
[40:51.850 --> 40:52.990]  Corn on the claws.
[40:54.810 --> 40:57.030]  It's just it's a three pronged wolverine.
[40:57.530 --> 40:57.910]  It's just wolverine branded.
[40:58.330 --> 41:00.330]  Yeah, it's like, yeah, corn on the cob holder.
[41:02.390 --> 41:05.610]  But I'm viewing your fingers as having personality.
[41:05.610 --> 41:09.990]  Do you think your thumb is the like warm and kind one of your hand?
[41:10.090 --> 41:11.510]  Do you think that's the vibe of a thumb?
[41:11.710 --> 41:11.990]  Absolutely.
[41:12.250 --> 41:15.490]  Because I don't I don't feel I feel like my thumb has Napoleon complex.
[41:15.850 --> 41:17.770]  I feel like my thumb is kind of...
[41:17.770 --> 41:19.510]  It's always like starting on the other fingers.
[41:20.090 --> 41:21.430]  Yeah, it's sort of I don't know.
[41:21.470 --> 41:23.410]  It's not fun, easily irritable.
[41:24.090 --> 41:24.670]  It's not great.
[41:24.770 --> 41:28.830]  I think my little finger is probably a little mischievous, likes to get into trouble.
[41:29.130 --> 41:30.290]  It's like the arrow of the hand.
[41:30.710 --> 41:32.330]  It's the arrow of the hand, I think.
[41:32.330 --> 41:36.130]  Yeah, I think the warm, warm is somewhere between the other three fingers.
[41:36.870 --> 41:37.830]  What is that?
[41:37.850 --> 41:39.010]  It's a guy with a long thumb.
[41:39.830 --> 41:40.590]  It's a long thumb.
[41:40.730 --> 41:43.710]  I just I was thinking about if if a longer thumb is warmer.
[41:44.110 --> 41:44.970]  Get out of it.
[41:45.090 --> 41:46.350]  That is such an Eric photo.
[41:47.070 --> 41:48.310]  I'm just curious.
[41:48.730 --> 41:49.970]  How many knuckles are there?
[41:50.830 --> 41:52.230]  He's got regular normal knuckles.
[41:52.530 --> 41:54.610]  Yeah, just straight crazy.
[41:55.330 --> 41:57.470]  He just long thumb warm and inviting.
[41:58.290 --> 42:00.670]  I look at that and I think his dad was E.T.
[42:00.670 --> 42:02.470]  That was where my brain goes.
[42:02.590 --> 42:04.090]  I bet he's the best hitchhiker in the world.
[42:04.970 --> 42:06.890]  Oh, well, that was kind of the whole.
[42:07.150 --> 42:10.170]  That was kind of the whole premise of even cowgirls get the blues, right?
[42:10.770 --> 42:12.710]  I have no idea what that is.
[42:12.970 --> 42:14.010]  Yeah, I'm not familiar with that.
[42:14.190 --> 42:15.330]  It's a book and movie.
[42:16.770 --> 42:18.450]  Ah, never heard of it.
[42:18.550 --> 42:19.110]  Hold on.
[42:19.250 --> 42:20.550]  Did Tony Scott direct it?
[42:20.670 --> 42:21.550]  Was it stylized?
[42:21.650 --> 42:22.570]  No, who directed it?
[42:22.870 --> 42:23.990]  Did they enhance in that film?
[42:24.350 --> 42:27.950]  You want another overly stylized movie is behind enemy lines.
[42:28.970 --> 42:30.070]  With Owen Wilson.
[42:30.350 --> 42:34.590]  I don't know the last time anyone here has watched behind enemy lines, but I was looking at it.
[42:34.870 --> 42:36.510]  I was watching clips of it recently.
[42:36.690 --> 42:37.010]  There you go.
[42:37.070 --> 42:39.430]  There's a lot of unnecessary edit thumb in that movie.
[42:39.950 --> 42:40.790]  Oh, that is.
[42:40.910 --> 42:41.150]  Yeah.
[42:41.370 --> 42:42.230]  Oh, my God.
[42:42.290 --> 42:43.150]  That thumb is so big.
[42:43.690 --> 42:44.530]  Oh, I think I just have it.
[42:44.550 --> 42:46.750]  I found the new weird thing that I just don't like.
[42:46.870 --> 42:47.470]  Yeah, there's her.
[42:47.810 --> 42:48.810]  There's her big thumbs.
[42:49.350 --> 42:50.910]  You're against you're against thumbs.
[42:51.830 --> 42:53.290]  They are warm and inviting.
[42:53.430 --> 42:55.550]  You don't want to suck this off while you eat from a fork or whatever.
[42:58.410 --> 42:59.510]  I'm just checking.
[43:02.930 --> 43:05.330]  You can have a whole plate of spaghetti on that thumb.
[43:06.970 --> 43:09.590]  I'm never going to stop sending images of this.
[43:10.050 --> 43:11.350]  I can't get enough of these.
[43:12.410 --> 43:13.290]  Oh, God.
[43:13.670 --> 43:16.410]  That is a powerful thumbs.
[43:16.930 --> 43:19.390]  Yeah, this is fucked up to send this to people.
[43:20.770 --> 43:23.750]  Is the premise that they have big hands in this movie?
[43:23.890 --> 43:24.630]  Like, what is?
[43:24.730 --> 43:25.650]  No, she has a big.
[43:25.750 --> 43:26.730]  She just has big thumbs.
[43:28.270 --> 43:30.930]  OK, I read I read the book when I was like 19.
[43:31.030 --> 43:35.210]  I'll be honest, I can't fucking I can't remember what it was about.
[43:35.450 --> 43:37.190]  She was a she was a hitchhiker, though.
[43:37.310 --> 43:39.430]  I remember that just her story.
[43:39.750 --> 43:40.290]  That makes sense.
[43:41.230 --> 43:42.490]  What a weird.
[43:43.450 --> 43:45.450]  Yeah, so think about it for the fork thumb.
[43:46.290 --> 43:50.470]  I would probably do it differently than that brilliant designer with the warm feelings.
[43:50.470 --> 43:54.190]  But I might if I can get into some spot welding or something,
[43:54.230 --> 43:55.670]  I might try to make up some prototypes.
[43:56.330 --> 44:01.990]  I would gladly buy your fork thumb product as well as the face logo.
[44:02.310 --> 44:03.230]  Crazy straw.
[44:04.510 --> 44:05.950]  But we got it.
[44:06.110 --> 44:07.150]  This is a sad day, guys.
[44:07.330 --> 44:10.210]  This is there is a market crash that has occurred.
[44:10.430 --> 44:10.950]  Oh, no.
[44:11.450 --> 44:16.670]  Not to be overly discussing McDonald's, but I placed an order.
[44:17.090 --> 44:20.150]  I got some chicken nuggets and I went in when, you know,
[44:20.150 --> 44:23.030]  when you put in your order, you have to click what sauces you want.
[44:23.290 --> 44:24.190]  Did you do your hack?
[44:24.990 --> 44:25.690]  Oh, no.
[44:25.830 --> 44:26.510]  That's a breakfast.
[44:26.670 --> 44:28.310]  This is a lunch order.
[44:28.950 --> 44:30.450]  Get my nuggets going into the sauces.
[44:30.790 --> 44:33.630]  They fucking they brought back the BTS sauces.
[44:33.810 --> 44:35.210]  They fucking brought him back.
[44:35.390 --> 44:36.350]  They brought him back.
[44:36.410 --> 44:37.650]  The market is flooded.
[44:37.910 --> 44:40.130]  Once again, they've devalued the stash.
[44:40.330 --> 44:42.070]  They've devalued the stash.
[44:42.230 --> 44:46.870]  I have hundreds of BTS sauces still useless.
[44:47.170 --> 44:48.650]  You held on too long.
[44:49.170 --> 44:50.390]  Oh, I held on.
[44:50.810 --> 44:52.470]  Well, there's never a peak in the market.
[44:52.470 --> 44:54.590]  You can argue the market never existed.
[44:54.850 --> 44:55.770]  Maybe there's some value.
[44:55.990 --> 44:58.310]  Maybe you have like a first run BTS sauce.
[44:58.790 --> 45:00.490]  I like that's optimistic thinking.
[45:01.050 --> 45:03.770]  Maybe anything on it that says that it's like the original.
[45:03.950 --> 45:04.750]  There is a slight.
[45:04.890 --> 45:06.810]  There is a slight difference between the two.
[45:07.570 --> 45:11.470]  There is the name of the flavor in Korean on mine,
[45:11.530 --> 45:14.990]  and it's just there's no Korean writing on the other ones.
[45:15.330 --> 45:17.810]  Oh, so there's a slight difference.
[45:17.890 --> 45:18.410]  Maybe you're right.
[45:18.770 --> 45:20.970]  I think that's a big distinction, actually.
[45:21.690 --> 45:25.230]  Do you think if I mail these into like PSA, can I get them graded?
[45:25.510 --> 45:27.870]  Yeah, I think they could.
[45:28.710 --> 45:30.010]  Yeah, what are they not great?
[45:30.310 --> 45:31.150]  What would they send back?
[45:31.550 --> 45:32.590]  I mean, they grade their limit.
[45:32.730 --> 45:33.690]  They grade just about anything.
[45:34.490 --> 45:37.730]  Yeah, I think that you should you should send probably four or five.
[45:37.870 --> 45:39.730]  So that way they have they can compare and contrast.
[45:39.970 --> 45:40.790]  This is a nine.
[45:40.950 --> 45:41.910]  And then they look at the other one.
[45:41.930 --> 45:42.430]  They're like, never mind.
[45:42.470 --> 45:43.350]  That was a nine, too.
[45:43.770 --> 45:44.250]  You know what I mean?
[45:46.690 --> 45:47.590]  I'm looking to doing that.
[45:47.690 --> 45:50.170]  I was going to make my own, but I'd like to get it professionally graded.
[45:50.970 --> 45:52.050]  I don't trust my system.
[45:52.410 --> 45:56.930]  I had a I was watching Sloppy Joe's the other day and I had a realization
[45:57.870 --> 45:59.490]  and I was going to see what you guys thought about this.
[46:00.050 --> 46:06.010]  I think you could build an entire wardrobe of clothes, of shirts out of
[46:06.930 --> 46:09.950]  purely out of spoofs of ACDC logos.
[46:12.570 --> 46:15.550]  Or possibly Metallica, you could do Metallica as well.
[46:16.170 --> 46:21.230]  There are so many that does have to be the two most ripped off logos of all time.
[46:21.330 --> 46:27.950]  You could have 20 shirts in your closet that were all ACDC shirts that weren't ACDC shirts.
[46:28.210 --> 46:29.130]  Do you have an example?
[46:29.730 --> 46:29.990]  Sure.
[46:31.830 --> 46:33.430]  A, B, C, D.
[46:36.230 --> 46:39.750]  Oh, yeah, just the lightning bolt and the font style.
[46:39.850 --> 46:41.010]  Any word with an I in it.
[46:41.550 --> 46:43.870]  Yeah, ADHD, ABCD.
[46:44.710 --> 46:45.210]  I saw one.
[46:45.210 --> 46:47.010]  I saw one the other day.
[46:47.110 --> 46:47.670]  Here's one.
[46:47.770 --> 46:48.690]  Here's a great one for Texas.
[46:49.330 --> 46:49.730]  Taco.
[46:51.970 --> 46:53.490]  What about HSBC?
[46:54.510 --> 46:56.170]  Here's a funny one that I had never seen before.
[46:56.370 --> 46:57.970]  This isn't ACDC, but TMNT.
[47:00.050 --> 47:01.070]  Enjoy your cock.
[47:01.330 --> 47:02.110]  That's a cool one.
[47:03.390 --> 47:04.150]  Yeah, I don't know.
[47:04.210 --> 47:09.430]  I just like I was just thinking about it and that there's so fucking many and I see them all the time
[47:10.230 --> 47:14.730]  that I wonder I wonder if anybody has ever keyed in and decided like that's going to be their thing.
[47:14.730 --> 47:18.190]  I'm going to have like Metallica shirts that aren't Metallica shirts.
[47:18.250 --> 47:19.270]  They're Helvetica shirts.
[47:19.670 --> 47:25.810]  Or maybe you're maybe you're really religious and they're Jesus shirts.
[47:27.530 --> 47:32.210]  Should we sell a shirt that just says face but in like wingdings?
[47:33.950 --> 47:34.990]  I like the idea.
[47:35.050 --> 47:37.770]  I feel like we got to get the crazy straw going first.
[47:38.250 --> 47:39.710]  There's a Don Zimmer one.
[47:39.830 --> 47:41.050]  Don Zimmer one.
[47:41.230 --> 47:41.490]  Sick.
[47:41.590 --> 47:43.970]  That D doesn't register at all as.
[47:43.970 --> 47:44.470]  No.
[47:44.850 --> 47:46.570]  It looks like it says own Zimmer.
[47:47.690 --> 47:48.230]  Oh, dude.
[47:48.330 --> 47:52.430]  Speaking of Don Zimmer, I saw one of these in the wild.
[47:53.290 --> 47:54.310]  What is that?
[47:54.430 --> 47:55.110]  Oh, it's a Zimmer.
[47:55.490 --> 47:56.210]  That's a Zimmer.
[47:56.330 --> 47:57.150]  Where'd you see that car?
[47:57.490 --> 47:58.590]  I've never seen a Zimmer before.
[47:58.590 --> 48:00.710]  It looked freakish and I looked at the back of it.
[48:00.770 --> 48:01.890]  It said Zimmer on the back.
[48:02.010 --> 48:06.930]  I don't know if that was like a brand or like a make of car or whether the owner put Zimmer on it.
[48:07.050 --> 48:07.550]  That's crazy.
[48:08.230 --> 48:10.570]  But yeah, I just googled Zimmer and it's like that's what it was.
[48:11.010 --> 48:12.310]  I don't even know how to describe it.
[48:12.310 --> 48:20.070]  That would be like, imagine what a Italian gangster Batman villain would drive in Gotham.
[48:20.190 --> 48:21.770]  And like a Tim Burton movie.
[48:21.990 --> 48:23.030]  Zimmer Golden Spirit.
[48:23.710 --> 48:24.890]  Dang, that's really cool.
[48:24.890 --> 48:25.370]  Never heard of that.
[48:26.150 --> 48:29.530]  Should we make that the official vehicle of the podcast?
[48:30.210 --> 48:31.250]  The Zimmermobile?
[48:31.550 --> 48:31.970]  Absolutely.
[48:32.230 --> 48:33.710]  How much do you think those cars cost?
[48:34.770 --> 48:35.750]  More than 10.
[48:38.550 --> 48:39.590]  200 grand.
[48:39.590 --> 48:42.730]  What if we put a picture of it on the obelisk?
[48:45.470 --> 48:47.670]  I can't wait to find out what the name of that town is.
[48:47.670 --> 48:48.770]  Look at the horns, dude.
[48:49.770 --> 48:53.570]  What if we just put that on two raised posts and that will be our billboard?
[48:56.830 --> 48:59.910]  Are we going to talk about the idea for what happens with like the loser?
[49:00.450 --> 49:01.570]  Because it's not just about the winner.
[49:02.090 --> 49:04.030]  Or do you want to save that for like the actual show?
[49:04.750 --> 49:05.350]  I don't know.
[49:05.470 --> 49:05.910]  I don't need...
[49:05.910 --> 49:08.090]  Let's talk about the idea for the loser because I don't remember.
[49:08.650 --> 49:09.370]  You really don't?
[49:09.450 --> 49:09.770]  I don't remember it either.
[49:09.870 --> 49:10.030]  No.
[49:10.510 --> 49:11.710]  I will the second I know it.
[49:12.270 --> 49:14.630]  We had an idea where the winner gets the billboard,
[49:14.750 --> 49:17.110]  but the loser isn't the person who's eliminated first.
[49:17.170 --> 49:20.350]  It's the person who loses in the finals who comes in second place.
[49:20.970 --> 49:23.670]  Which is somehow, I don't know, funny to me.
[49:23.830 --> 49:25.710]  Like, worse to get that close and lose.
[49:26.290 --> 49:31.830]  But Geoff bought those red boots.
[49:32.110 --> 49:33.170]  The red meme boots.
[49:33.550 --> 49:34.470]  Big red boots.
[49:34.590 --> 49:34.970]  That's right.
[49:35.490 --> 49:41.990]  He bought these and was wearing them around his house when he made us watch him play a video game.
[49:47.490 --> 49:48.690]  That's right.
[49:48.970 --> 49:51.810]  So the loser of this competition, when we do it,
[49:51.870 --> 49:56.970]  the winner gets the billboard in the epicenter of the f***face universe.
[49:57.970 --> 50:02.510]  And then the loser who gets second place, not third through sixth or whatever,
[50:02.510 --> 50:05.110]  has to walk around the mall in those boots for an hour.
[50:07.090 --> 50:09.770]  Yeah, we have to be able to see him do it and everything.
[50:09.950 --> 50:13.330]  Go grocery shopping or has to be out in public in those dumb shoes.
[50:13.630 --> 50:18.070]  And by the way, wear pads because they rubbed my shins off after about 15 minutes.
[50:18.190 --> 50:20.510]  So I was dude, your shins were raw.
[50:20.750 --> 50:21.450]  That was crazy.
[50:23.130 --> 50:26.330]  I wanted to send this picture also, but it f***ed up and now it's good.
[50:27.870 --> 50:29.090]  A little Hasbulla.
[50:29.090 --> 50:29.670]  Uh-huh.
[50:32.170 --> 50:33.990]  I love that as a loser punishment.
[50:34.190 --> 50:35.370]  Yeah, those right. Isn't that great?
[50:35.470 --> 50:39.350]  I also love the idea of it's who comes in second, not who comes in last.
[50:39.670 --> 50:43.970]  Yeah, those boots were so stupid. I had to get them.
[50:44.370 --> 50:45.990]  I'm glad we figured out something to do with them.
[50:46.510 --> 50:47.110]  And they delivered.
[50:47.290 --> 50:49.870]  They delivered on stupidness, not just in how they look.
[50:54.770 --> 50:56.550]  That's how he was dressed with his little hat.
[50:56.550 --> 50:58.590]  He made us watch him play video games.
[50:58.790 --> 50:59.750]  And it really...
[51:00.290 --> 51:03.170]  I don't know what it is. You look like you're wearing plungers,
[51:03.390 --> 51:06.530]  like more so than other people in the boots.
[51:07.830 --> 51:09.690]  The way he was moving around was great.
[51:11.150 --> 51:12.030]  They're not easy to walk in.
[51:12.030 --> 51:13.410]  What was your mobility like in this?
[51:13.590 --> 51:14.230]  Like 75%.
[51:15.010 --> 51:15.810]  Really? Okay.
[51:16.570 --> 51:17.770]  You wouldn't want to do a marathon in them.
[51:17.810 --> 51:18.970]  You wouldn't want to do a marathon in them.
[51:19.010 --> 51:21.790]  But you could definitely walk around the mall and eat at Sbarro.
[51:22.230 --> 51:25.150]  Nick says it looks like you stole those off a giant caterpillar.
[51:28.950 --> 51:31.890]  What caterpillar? Is there like a Mario character that has those?
[51:32.050 --> 51:33.350]  I'm seeing the same thing.
[51:33.450 --> 51:34.790]  Yeah, like a Goomba or something.
[51:35.350 --> 51:38.230]  Yeah, like you fucking beat up a Goomba and stole his shoes.
[51:38.230 --> 51:40.650]  I think they're designed... they're based off Astro Boy, right?
[51:42.630 --> 51:43.990]  Doesn't he have rockets in them though?
[51:44.690 --> 51:46.510]  These do not have rockets.
[51:47.290 --> 51:48.050]  I'd assume.
[51:48.610 --> 51:50.110]  That's what I'm thinking of.
[51:50.910 --> 51:52.750]  That's the caterpillar with the flower.
[51:54.270 --> 51:55.630]  What was that, like a wiggler or something?
[51:55.630 --> 51:56.830]  His name is Wiggler.
[51:57.250 --> 51:59.470]  And then you jump on his head and he goes all red.
[52:00.750 --> 52:02.090]  And his flower falls off.
[52:02.570 --> 52:05.870]  Something really funny about beating up a wiggler and stealing his shoes.
[52:06.030 --> 52:07.110]  Hey look, that's Pissed Wiggler.
[52:08.090 --> 52:09.770]  Oh, Pissed Wiggler is so mad.
[52:10.130 --> 52:12.110]  I mean, wouldn't you be mad if someone jumped on your head?
[52:12.370 --> 52:13.650]  That's what the loser's gonna look like.
[52:14.050 --> 52:15.290]  That's what second place is.
[52:16.690 --> 52:17.410]  That's fantastic.
[52:18.910 --> 52:20.850]  Ah, so I guess we'll do that when we get around to doing that.
[52:20.970 --> 52:22.010]  Yeah, that sounds great.
[52:22.150 --> 52:24.070]  That thing, which we'll probably start to fuck with after RTX.
[52:24.070 --> 52:26.750]  I made a I wasted my time recently.
[52:26.950 --> 52:27.970]  I made a dumb mistake.
[52:28.470 --> 52:29.450]  Was that fucked up?
[52:29.890 --> 52:33.570]  I went to the doctor recently and like talking about anxiety thing.
[52:33.790 --> 52:35.890]  And so I'm like, I'm getting a prescription for it.
[52:35.970 --> 52:36.830]  And I had to.
[52:37.170 --> 52:40.010]  I didn't have to, but it was like, hey, do you want to talk to somebody about anxiety?
[52:40.090 --> 52:41.650]  And I was like, I've never done that professionally.
[52:41.650 --> 52:42.450]  So, yeah, sure.
[52:42.810 --> 52:43.390]  Why not?
[52:43.850 --> 52:44.610]  I'll try it.
[52:44.970 --> 52:48.050]  And so I agreed to this appointment where I was going to talk about it.
[52:48.210 --> 52:51.650]  And then getting up to the appointment, I was feeling anxious because it's like,
[52:51.650 --> 52:54.590]  I don't really I don't know how to necessarily talk about it.
[52:54.690 --> 52:57.190]  It's not something I've had a conversation with in that way.
[52:57.210 --> 52:58.170]  Like a therapy thing?
[52:58.830 --> 52:59.510]  Sort of, yeah.
[52:59.510 --> 53:03.250]  Like a through the clinic, almost therapy type discussion.
[53:03.750 --> 53:04.690]  Yeah, I didn't really know.
[53:04.770 --> 53:07.810]  They're just like, hey, do you want to do this while we also give you medication for it?
[53:07.810 --> 53:08.610]  And I said, why not?
[53:10.050 --> 53:14.870]  So I was looking into it and I found I was like on the site and I'm on my phone
[53:14.870 --> 53:19.090]  and I found this other link and I'm like going from webpage to webpage and I finally found it.
[53:19.390 --> 53:20.610]  And they had all these modules.
[53:20.610 --> 53:22.730]  It was like a 10 module process thing.
[53:22.890 --> 53:24.090]  I thought, oh, this is great.
[53:24.170 --> 53:27.330]  Like this is I assume what we'll go through on the call.
[53:27.430 --> 53:30.310]  Like we'll start the first module and we'll talk about things.
[53:30.410 --> 53:35.630]  If I can do this now, I'll be prepared for going into that that discussion
[53:35.630 --> 53:36.750]  and that will make me feel better.
[53:36.870 --> 53:41.210]  So I'm reading through it and there's all these exercises in it of like
[53:41.210 --> 53:44.250]  these are common trigger points or like things you could feel.
[53:44.350 --> 53:45.250]  How many of these do you feel?
[53:45.470 --> 53:49.130]  Writing that down and it's like, think about how you feel in this scenario
[53:49.130 --> 53:50.770]  and list all of these things.
[53:50.950 --> 53:54.350]  And like some of them are like heavier emotional questions.
[53:54.550 --> 53:59.570]  And then at the end, there is this giant like sheet thing I had to print out,
[53:59.690 --> 54:02.830]  almost like a school assignment of like spiderweb type
[54:02.830 --> 54:05.930]  feeling things of like cause and effect and all that shit.
[54:05.990 --> 54:10.710]  So I did all this work and I organized it and then a few days pass
[54:10.710 --> 54:14.070]  and it's like five minutes before I'm going to have my call.
[54:14.290 --> 54:18.190]  And I think, oh, I should I should pull up all that stuff.
[54:18.190 --> 54:22.030]  And also, I don't even remember what the name of that organization was.
[54:22.590 --> 54:24.170]  I should have that as well.
[54:24.270 --> 54:28.230]  So I can direct the conversation to be like, oh, yeah, I was on the site.
[54:28.750 --> 54:31.890]  I found these these things and I prepared for this.
[54:32.530 --> 54:36.010]  So I'm looking around and there's nothing immediately on the form
[54:36.010 --> 54:37.730]  for it at the top or anything.
[54:37.810 --> 54:39.230]  There's not like a logo or a company name.
[54:39.430 --> 54:43.930]  And so scrolling through and I eventually found a block of text and I'm reading.
[54:44.050 --> 54:45.690]  I'm like, oh, this is great. This is what it is.
[54:45.730 --> 54:47.210]  And I'm reading the address of the thing.
[54:47.210 --> 54:48.730]  And it's like, oh, yeah, I remember those letters.
[54:48.830 --> 54:49.490]  That's exactly it.
[54:49.830 --> 54:54.830]  And I'm continuing to read the domain and I realized it ends in dot AU.
[54:56.010 --> 54:58.530]  And I think that can't be correct.
[54:58.890 --> 55:02.470]  And so I click it and it takes me to an Australian website.
[55:02.930 --> 55:04.530]  I don't know how I got there.
[55:04.690 --> 55:08.950]  I ended up on a random Australian anxiety support site
[55:08.950 --> 55:12.050]  and I did their entire first module for no reason.
[55:12.250 --> 55:14.050]  Didn't come up once during the call.
[55:14.190 --> 55:15.650]  Had nothing to do with anything.
[55:16.110 --> 55:16.910]  Completely irrelevant.
[55:17.490 --> 55:23.290]  I wasted like an hour doing a module for something that had nothing to do with what I was doing.
[55:23.670 --> 55:25.310]  Did you find it helpful in any way?
[55:25.710 --> 55:30.750]  Not necessarily because it was a lot of the setup to what would then be helpful.
[55:31.190 --> 55:33.710]  It was a lot of the things to discuss.
[55:33.710 --> 55:35.230]  How did you get on that? How did you find that?
[55:35.230 --> 55:36.250]  I don't know.
[55:36.430 --> 55:40.030]  I was on my phone and I was I clicked one thing and I couldn't
[55:40.030 --> 55:43.390]  like I just was going from site to site and that's where I ended up and it seemed to fit.
[55:43.870 --> 55:45.070]  And so I did it.
[55:45.170 --> 55:48.290]  But it was not relevant in any way.
[55:48.890 --> 55:51.850]  They so you understandably to go into this thing and be like, yeah,
[55:51.850 --> 55:56.490]  I've studied all the material that I thought that I was going to get a leg up and be like,
[55:56.570 --> 55:58.590]  oh, I'm already ready for module two.
[55:58.710 --> 56:00.330]  Let me. I thought I was going to impress him.
[56:00.410 --> 56:01.970]  Be like, nah, no, I wrote everything down.
[56:02.130 --> 56:03.670]  I got all the answers for you.
[56:04.370 --> 56:07.510]  Instead, I was directed to anxietycanada.ca,
[56:07.650 --> 56:11.270]  which makes a lot more sense, but was not a site that I'd explored previous.
[56:12.270 --> 56:14.030]  Was any of the examples?
[56:14.370 --> 56:17.190]  Did it give any like Australian hints looking back on it?
[56:17.310 --> 56:21.970]  No, no, I would have if there was like a Tim Tam somewhere in the document.
[56:22.390 --> 56:23.070]  Boomerang phobia.
[56:23.390 --> 56:25.150]  If there was any mention of Vegemite.
[56:25.630 --> 56:28.170]  Are you concerned about spreading Vegemite a public space?
[56:28.170 --> 56:28.870]  I would have got it.
[56:28.990 --> 56:30.070]  I would have been like, wait a second.
[56:31.110 --> 56:33.790]  There was when you went through your Canadian site.
[56:33.790 --> 56:36.270]  Did you find any similarities between the material?
[56:36.590 --> 56:38.110]  I haven't gone through.
[56:38.230 --> 56:39.150]  This is just like yesterday.
[56:39.150 --> 56:41.290]  You're probably exhausted from doing the other module.
[56:41.410 --> 56:42.550]  Yeah, take a break.
[56:42.590 --> 56:46.690]  Yeah, I need to back up to start a whole new plan.
[56:47.050 --> 56:51.790]  I just love the idea of you only being being able to handle Australian anxiety.
[56:53.810 --> 56:55.270]  I got my hands.
[56:55.470 --> 56:56.550]  I got a real control.
[56:56.870 --> 57:00.210]  If we ever go to Australia, oh boy, I'm ready.
[57:00.470 --> 57:01.550]  I've studied for this.
[57:03.310 --> 57:06.350]  Yeah, don't don't think of it as wasting your time.
[57:06.350 --> 57:11.230]  Think of it as being super fucking prepared for a very unlikely eventuality.
[57:12.450 --> 57:14.090]  Oh, that's really funny.
[57:15.150 --> 57:16.370]  I felt real dumb.
[57:16.890 --> 57:18.310]  I did all that work.
[57:21.310 --> 57:22.270]  That's amazing.
[57:22.890 --> 57:24.670]  Yeah, don't feel bad, dude.
[57:24.670 --> 57:26.030]  I feel dumb all the time.
[57:26.310 --> 57:29.050]  Like 22 out of 24 hours a day.
[57:29.090 --> 57:29.710]  I feel stupid.
[57:30.610 --> 57:31.870]  There's 100 what?
[57:32.030 --> 57:34.670]  64 episodes of dumb here.
[57:34.670 --> 57:37.270]  There's 163 maybe?
[57:37.630 --> 57:40.150]  Yeah, I wonder if we've had an episode without any dumb in it.
[57:40.230 --> 57:40.510]  No.
[57:40.710 --> 57:43.670]  Oh, 0% chance of that happening.
[57:43.930 --> 57:47.770]  I saw a bunch of comment leavers discussing our episodes and like how accessible they are
[57:47.770 --> 57:48.810]  to a new audience and stuff.
[57:49.010 --> 57:51.370]  And they were actually referring to some episodes.
[57:51.530 --> 57:53.750]  It's like, yeah, this is a good beginner episode.
[57:54.290 --> 57:55.850]  This one's like intermediate.
[57:56.030 --> 58:01.870]  This one's an expert, like how deep into the nothing law they were.
[58:02.390 --> 58:04.590]  And I love that our podcast can be ranked like that.
[58:04.670 --> 58:08.690]  Oh, speaking of something to love about our podcast, did you guys see, you know,
[58:08.730 --> 58:10.830]  we had that conversation about school songs.
[58:11.090 --> 58:13.750]  Did you guys see the the user that, not user,
[58:14.050 --> 58:16.930]  did you guys see the community member that made the Pride of F*** Face song?
[58:17.850 --> 58:19.550]  No, there's a Pride of F*** Face song?
[58:19.590 --> 58:20.190]  Yeah, you should.
[58:20.250 --> 58:22.250]  I know we need to wrap up, but you guys should listen to this.
[58:22.470 --> 58:24.190]  Maybe, Nick, you can play it in the episode or something.
[58:24.230 --> 58:25.230]  We'll get permission from the kid.
[58:25.250 --> 58:26.650]  Okay, let's listen to this.
[58:26.650 --> 58:27.690]  All right, listen to it now.
[58:32.330 --> 58:36.890]  Welcome to the Zim Zone, we don't deal in pleasantries.
[58:37.410 --> 58:40.730]  We'll curse your socks with broken ankles while watching MTV.
[58:41.750 --> 58:46.290]  We'll squirm for Cosmic Crisp, but eating pencils is just wrong.
[58:46.770 --> 58:50.710]  You're a regulation lister now that you have heard the song.
[58:52.970 --> 58:53.690]  This is so good.
[58:54.510 --> 58:58.830]  There are 20,000 things to name, Bovril root canals and beans,
[58:59.350 --> 59:03.250]  blindsiding and bat knobs and what extra meat is beans.
[59:04.110 --> 59:08.150]  And if you know the lyrics, leave a comment, sing along.
[59:10.030 --> 59:13.930]  Or just razzle off your grown tube and you can...
[59:23.630 --> 59:24.430]  That's fantastic.
[59:24.750 --> 59:27.070]  Now, that would be great to sing.
[59:28.110 --> 59:30.290]  Like everyone's grown tube going off at the same time.
[59:30.390 --> 59:30.770]  I love it.
[59:31.050 --> 59:32.950]  Oh, so there you go.
[59:33.010 --> 59:36.750]  That was at least it was posted by someone named Soup Taker on Reddit.
[59:36.950 --> 59:38.330]  I assume that's the person that made it.
[59:38.430 --> 59:38.930]  That's so good.
[59:38.930 --> 59:39.650]  Brilliant.
[59:40.430 --> 59:41.310]  Brilliant lyrics.
[59:42.570 --> 59:44.590]  Just a beautiful voice.
[59:44.890 --> 59:45.990]  Like what a talented musician.
[59:46.150 --> 59:46.970]  Very current, too.
[59:47.110 --> 59:48.050]  Very current reference.
[59:48.890 --> 59:52.570]  Very current and very like, yeah, just like just nailed it.
[59:52.890 --> 59:53.850]  Perfect execution.
[59:54.070 --> 59:55.510]  So I was blown away by that.
[59:55.570 --> 59:57.010]  I wanted to make sure you guys saw it, too.
[59:57.710 --> 59:58.570]  I love that.
[59:59.170 --> 01:00:02.030]  Once again, the community proves to be way more talented than us.
[01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:03.890]  Oh, by miles.
[01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:04.650]  As always.
[01:00:04.650 --> 01:00:09.490]  I enjoyed the blindside because it is emerging in ways that I didn't even anticipate.
[01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:11.690]  Where when we recorded our two drafts,
[01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:15.010]  Geoff was convinced the blindside was coming because there was two of them.
[01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:16.710]  Like we're doing drafts on a Monday.
[01:00:17.350 --> 01:00:20.650]  I hadn't heard of one of the two drafts we're going to do until the text conversation.
[01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:23.970]  Like it all seemed fucking just sketchy as all hell.
[01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:27.790]  And I was mad at myself the whole time for introducing this back into my life.
[01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:29.350]  But then we just did the drafts.
[01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:31.230]  I had fun in the last two drafts.
[01:00:31.290 --> 01:00:31.650]  I did, too.
[01:00:32.010 --> 01:00:32.850]  They're great drafts.
[01:00:32.850 --> 01:00:35.310]  Did you feel old?
[01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:38.050]  Like, did it make you feel old in any way?
[01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:39.690]  Looking back at commercials from your childhood?
[01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:41.330]  Yes.
[01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:43.530]  That was a weird side product for me.
[01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:47.750]  Like, I remember being a little kid and hearing my mom describe of like,
[01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:52.770]  for a nickel, we got 15 popcorns and six bags of candy.
[01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:55.530]  And just be like, oh, that feels old as shit.
[01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:56.750]  That was a long time ago.
[01:00:56.750 --> 01:01:01.130]  And then seeing commercials from like the late 90s,
[01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:08.050]  where KFC is selling 13 piece bucket for $13 and just being like, holy fuck, what?
[01:01:08.550 --> 01:01:10.830]  Like you're noticing inflation in your lifetime?
[01:01:11.070 --> 01:01:14.370]  Yeah, I'm seeing inflation and it's upsetting.
[01:01:14.790 --> 01:01:19.190]  I've turned into that is my theater thing of the candy and like the popcorn.
[01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:20.790]  That is my nickel story.
[01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:23.470]  Chicken has fucking gone up astronomically.
[01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:27.070]  I always feel old when like people I grew up watching or
[01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:30.230]  listening to, like married to people younger than me.
[01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:35.270]  Like like Britney Spears' husband was like born in 1994.
[01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:36.910]  That makes me feel old as shit.
[01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:41.110]  I always well, I just had this happen the other day, actually.
[01:01:41.590 --> 01:01:44.610]  I'm pretty like once you get up to my advanced age,
[01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:48.650]  you're acutely aware of how old you are at all times and you just see it constantly.
[01:01:48.810 --> 01:01:52.390]  But I got surprised with it the other day when I was thinking about when I was in high school,
[01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:53.250]  I was telling a story to somebody.
[01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:56.410]  I was thinking about when I was in high school and how I used to drive around.
[01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:58.350]  Like when I turned 16, I got my license.
[01:01:58.810 --> 01:02:02.190]  I was gone every second of the day that I could be.
[01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:05.610]  And I would just drive around in my car and listen to CDs from like
[01:02:05.610 --> 01:02:08.970]  7 p.m. until like 11 p.m. or whenever my parents made me come home.
[01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:12.150]  And I would just drive through neighborhoods and just by myself just to be away.
[01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:13.510]  And I was thinking about that.
[01:02:13.550 --> 01:02:15.810]  I was like, how the fuck did I afford all that gas?
[01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:17.970]  That was a lot of gas.
[01:02:18.210 --> 01:02:19.930]  Gas is like four bucks a gallon.
[01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:22.810]  And then I was like, how much did I make back then?
[01:02:22.830 --> 01:02:28.470]  And I was working as a tool repair man and I was making like $4.65 an hour.
[01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:32.290]  I think that was what minimum wage was.
[01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:35.170]  And I was like, damn, I was making like a gallon an hour.
[01:02:35.790 --> 01:02:38.890]  And then I was like, oh yeah, gas was like $0.72 when I was in high school.
[01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:40.030]  It was almost fucking free.
[01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:44.870]  I could fill up my entire car for like $11 when I was in high school.
[01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:46.490]  And that made me feel very old.
[01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:47.510]  That's crazy.
[01:02:48.050 --> 01:02:48.510]  I guess.
[01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:49.330]  Is it?
[01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:51.250]  Yeah, well, no, I'm just thinking about...
[01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:52.230]  That was the, that was the, I...
[01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:53.850]  Nobody has anything left to talk about.
[01:02:53.950 --> 01:02:55.690]  I'll just throw out a that's crazy moment.
[01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:57.870]  No, no, I was, I was...
[01:02:57.870 --> 01:02:58.830]  I kept saying we should wrap up.
[01:02:58.830 --> 01:02:59.770]  I know, that's what I'm saying.
[01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:00.930]  It's, it's happening in front of me.
[01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:04.170]  I always used to think, um, like those...
[01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:05.970]  I guess you didn't have little like Fred...
[01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:06.550]  What were those things?
[01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:07.570]  Freddo frogs or something?
[01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:09.270]  The fuck?
[01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:11.210]  Freddo frogs?
[01:03:11.290 --> 01:03:12.310]  Yeah, I feel like that's familiar.
[01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:15.250]  No, they were always like 16p or something.
[01:03:15.290 --> 01:03:17.090]  And then watching the price of those go up.
[01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:18.090]  I didn't have a car.
[01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:18.710]  I didn't, right?
[01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:19.850]  Yeah, the little choccies.
[01:03:20.350 --> 01:03:21.130]  Yeah, the little chocolate.
[01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:21.390]  Yeah.
[01:03:21.610 --> 01:03:21.910]  What do you mean?
[01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:22.770]  Oh.
[01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:24.350]  Oh, yeah, Freddo.
[01:03:24.690 --> 01:03:26.470]  They don't have that in America, but I've seen it in England.
[01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:31.070]  They usually have the price on the packet, which I think is...
[01:03:31.070 --> 01:03:32.470]  That's, that's because I didn't have a car.
[01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:33.650]  That's my gas thing.
[01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:34.930]  That's your gas.
[01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:36.230]  The price of Freddo go up.
[01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:37.670]  The price of Freddos have gone up.
[01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:40.070]  I think they were like 15p when I was a kid.
[01:03:40.930 --> 01:03:43.090]  They were always the cheapest chocolate to get.
[01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:49.550]  What's crazy, I was thinking about is like, as far as feeling old goes,
[01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:53.770]  I don't think there are people like if someone was like 15 now,
[01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:57.030]  they don't even really have commercials in the way that we experience them.
[01:03:57.130 --> 01:03:57.930]  No, not at all.
[01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:59.430]  Nobody watches TV now.
[01:03:59.630 --> 01:04:03.450]  Like it's, I'm essentially the cutoff for when you could do that.
[01:04:03.550 --> 01:04:07.590]  I have a 17 year old daughter who doesn't know what TV is in the,
[01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:09.590]  in the sense that I, that I know what it is.
[01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:11.570]  Like cable means nothing to her.
[01:04:12.070 --> 01:04:13.070]  Satellite means nothing to her.
[01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:15.150]  Like over the air broadcast means nothing.
[01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:21.310]  Like TV to Millie is YouTube and Netflix and Hulu and whatever other streaming service.
[01:04:21.610 --> 01:04:23.030]  And yeah, yeah.
[01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:24.470]  It's like the world is totally different.
[01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:28.070]  Yeah. I don't even know what, like what the comparable would be for like,
[01:04:28.090 --> 01:04:29.950]  what would that, I just don't think it exists.
[01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:31.850]  Well, like a live event, maybe.
[01:04:32.450 --> 01:04:32.730]  Yeah.
[01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:35.150]  Like people still want to watch live sports, don't they?
[01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:36.010]  Otherwise it's irrelevant.
[01:04:36.450 --> 01:04:38.470]  None of my friends, just me and Eric.
[01:04:40.270 --> 01:04:44.150]  Yeah. If a sport isn't live, I'm not probably going to watch it.
[01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.510]  There's no way.
[01:04:44.650 --> 01:04:48.250]  So, so even if, even if you were at work when the game was on,
[01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:50.350]  and then you've recorded it, you're coming home.
[01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:51.630]  It was like four hours ago.
[01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:54.330]  You don't know the result. Is it less exciting for you?
[01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:59.250]  You're, you're, you're posing a scenario that I've never done where it's recording sports.
[01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:00.150]  Oh.
[01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:02.250]  What if it was the, the world cup final?
[01:05:02.330 --> 01:05:05.070]  I do that. I record Celtics games if I can't watch them live.
[01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:08.190]  And so that I can, I can catch up and I try to avoid it.
[01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:11.070]  Sport is baseball. They play 162 of them.
[01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:14.010]  I don't need, I don't need to make sure I watch everyone.
[01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:17.090]  There was one going on earlier today, like a Padres game.
[01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:20.950]  And I don't, I'll keep an eye on the score, but I don't need to watch
[01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:22.990]  100% of the games during the season.
[01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:24.390]  It'll make me insane if I do that.
[01:05:24.450 --> 01:05:26.050]  What if there were just 40 games?
[01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:29.130]  I mean, I, I guess.
[01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:29.750]  Like an NFL season?
[01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:34.590]  Like, yeah, I mean, like, but, but even then, even when I was a Chargers fan,
[01:05:34.590 --> 01:05:39.750]  there's 16 games or were, and, uh, if I missed one, it would be like,
[01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:42.270]  I'll keep an eye on the score and hopefully we won, but I'm not going to go back.
[01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:47.190]  I have endless access to every highlight that I would ever need.
[01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:49.490]  And I don't need to sit there and watch every play.
[01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:53.930]  It's, it's fun live, but I just can't, I can't do it.
[01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:58.630]  So if you, if the, if the US was in the world cup final, right?
[01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:01.810]  And you had to do a, like a break shit stream.
[01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:04.750]  Would you just watch it there and then on the stream or would you?
[01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:05.910]  No, I think, I think I would.
[01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:08.850]  I think I would put work first because I'm pretty dead.
[01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:10.510]  I'm pretty dedicated to this show.
[01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:14.310]  What, what if it hadn't happened since 1966 or whatever?
[01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:18.090]  Well, I mean, I, I think I'm pretty dedicated to the show and the people in it.
[01:06:18.110 --> 01:06:22.110]  And so I think I would put your guys' feelings first and really just try to give in the,
[01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:24.330]  and the fans, I would try to put the fans first
[01:06:25.470 --> 01:06:29.470]  and really just give them the most of me that I could possibly give.
[01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:34.310]  Uh, so you're, you're a, you're a man of the, of the people.
[01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:38.090]  Oh, a hundred percent. I think if that's, if there's one thing you could say about me,
[01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:39.790]  it's that.
[01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:42.890]  I guess it was only the Euros. It wasn't the world cup.
[01:06:43.350 --> 01:06:47.270]  I actually will sometimes when I'm watching live sports, which is pretty often,
[01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:51.070]  I'll just pause for like the first 10 minutes of the game or 15 minutes of the game
[01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:56.010]  just to let, to let, to let a buffer queue up so I can fast forward through commercials.
[01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:57.370]  That's fair.
[01:06:57.370 --> 01:07:00.310]  Because I'll be caught up with the game by halftime, you know?
[01:07:00.590 --> 01:07:00.910]  Right. Yeah.
[01:07:01.290 --> 01:07:04.650]  The thing that you want the experience of like live and in the moment,
[01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:07.090]  that's sort of the problem of even if I don't know the result,
[01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:11.010]  I feel like if something truly insane happened, I would have heard about it in some way.
[01:07:11.130 --> 01:07:11.650]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:07:11.830 --> 01:07:13.570]  And the fact I didn't means nothing did.
[01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:16.150]  That was always the thing with me. Like when I lived in England for
[01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:19.250]  watching the Euros or watching the world cup is that you couldn't
[01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:23.830]  save it for later if you were at home, because while most of us lived in like
[01:07:23.830 --> 01:07:27.250]  terraces or semi-detached houses and you could hear people screaming through the walls.
[01:07:27.370 --> 01:07:30.590]  So you'd be like, oh, damn.
[01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:35.070]  Like when you can fast forward, it's really tough for me to not be like,
[01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:36.390]  why don't I just see how this went?
[01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:38.570]  Like, why don't I just fast forward to the end?
[01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:41.910]  If we lost, do I really want to watch three hours of us?
[01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.850]  Oh, trust me, dude.
[01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:45.550]  Like Celtics are down by 17 in the second quarter.
[01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:49.370]  I'm fast forwarding through most of it until I start to see that number change.
[01:07:51.570 --> 01:07:54.770]  I don't need to watch I don't need to watch us lose for no reason
[01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:58.970]  by 15 points for the fucking 10 billionth time in the last four years.
[01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:03.530]  So now that we've done two of these, are we are we in a prime blindside position, Eric?
[01:08:03.790 --> 01:08:06.770]  I mean, yeah, we could be at this point.
[01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:09.790]  We're probably going to likely miss next week, but we can try.
[01:08:10.110 --> 01:08:11.270]  So we'll see.
[01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:14.250]  But we do need to end this one in order for any of that to occur.
[01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:14.750]  Huh?
[01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:17.550]  So if we keep this going, there's no blindsides.
[01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:19.830]  We have we have RTX next week.
[01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:20.570]  Is it on Thursday?
[01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:24.170]  I have a lot of prep to do on Thursday.
[01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:25.630]  All right.
[01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:27.910]  You need to change the day, Eric. I'm available.
[01:08:28.150 --> 01:08:29.410]  He said he he said it.
[01:08:29.530 --> 01:08:31.310]  It was weirdly smug when he said that.
[01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:32.030]  And I don't like it.
[01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:32.410]  I agree.
[01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:37.390]  But Eric did say earlier, Gavin, that if we wanted to do one next week,
[01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:39.010]  Wednesday might be a good day to do it.
[01:08:39.270 --> 01:08:40.510]  Yes, it is up to you guys.
[01:08:40.570 --> 01:08:42.390]  If we do want to do that, you just let me know and we can
[01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:44.270]  we can get it on the schedule and we can aim for it.
[01:08:44.710 --> 01:08:45.030]  OK.
[01:08:46.210 --> 01:08:49.150]  I don't like the way he said, OK, I don't like that either.
[01:08:49.530 --> 01:08:51.170]  Yeah, it's not just me, right?
[01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:53.550]  Gavin, you could have gotten out of here unscathed.
[01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:55.230]  And now it's I don't know what's happening.
[01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:56.950]  What's going on with you, Gavin?
[01:08:57.130 --> 01:08:57.590]  What's with that?
[01:08:57.710 --> 01:09:03.130]  OK, it was like 60 percent saying, OK, and 40 percent looking at my calendar.
[01:09:03.190 --> 01:09:04.970]  And I just feel like overall it was fine.
[01:09:05.170 --> 01:09:08.990]  But maybe some of the energy went into the eyes instead of the mouth.
[01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:11.490]  Some of the energy.
[01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:12.190]  OK, all right.
[01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:13.030]  We need to wrap this up.
[01:09:13.090 --> 01:09:13.790]  We're getting insane.
[01:09:15.690 --> 01:09:16.450]  Like boobies?
[01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:17.990]  Like little hops?
[01:09:19.570 --> 01:09:20.770]  Well, there you have it.
[01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:23.770]  You've listened to another episode of the F*** Face podcast.
[01:09:24.030 --> 01:09:27.050]  We hope you liked it and it had a good time.
[01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:28.670]  And if you did, maybe go out and celebrate.
[01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:35.230]  Get you some get you a nice, refreshing eyeball tea and suck down those dog eyes and think
[01:09:35.230 --> 01:09:39.010]  about them and how painful it was for them to be taken out of their eyes while they
[01:09:39.010 --> 01:09:41.030]  were alive just so that you could eat a refreshing drink.
[01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:45.090]  Because I hear that if you remove the eyes after the dog dies, it doesn't taste quite
[01:09:45.090 --> 01:09:45.510]  as sweet.
[01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:46.670]  We'll see you next week.
[01:09:48.210 --> 01:09:48.610]  Jesus.
[01:09:49.330 --> 01:09:50.270]  Hey, guys.

[01:10:01.090 --> 01:10:02.970]  It's a microwave pizza avalanche.
[01:10:03.370 --> 01:10:04.330]  How was Key West?
[01:10:04.730 --> 01:10:06.890]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:10.110]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
