[00:10.200 --> 00:11.160]  Can't hear anybody.
[00:11.560 --> 00:11.800]  What?
[00:12.860 --> 00:13.500]  That's not good.
[00:16.300 --> 00:19.160]  I didn't even know anyone was in here. I thought I was still here by myself.
[00:19.300 --> 00:20.840]  This show fucking sucks.
[00:23.460 --> 00:27.400]  This show is... this show is... this show is dog shit.
[00:27.820 --> 00:28.820]  This sucks.
[00:29.220 --> 00:30.400]  This is the worst.
[00:32.940 --> 00:53.980]  This is episode 165. Our previous episode included Dodging a Bullet, Andrew's Prototypes, Not Being a Knife Guy, RTX, Summer of 98 Yearbook, The Golden Gurgler, Crazy Puffs, 4 Three Cheeses, Souvenir Shirts Business, I forgot about that, Geoff at Sloppy Joe's, The North Face, F*** Face Guy, and Ocean Jet Skiing.
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.540]  But that's all 164. This is 165, so go ahead.
[00:56.580 --> 00:57.440]  Eric, can I ask you a favor?
[00:57.780 --> 00:58.420]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:58.420 --> 01:02.260]  Can you not start the recap before 3 p.m. please?
[01:03.600 --> 01:10.100]  But the point of you getting here at 3 p.m. is that we start on time when you're here.
[01:10.400 --> 01:12.860]  If the recap's in the episode, I have to disagree, Eric.
[01:13.900 --> 01:14.860]  I'm not...
[01:15.700 --> 01:16.180]  What?
[01:17.740 --> 01:19.080]  That's in the episode, isn't it?
[01:19.380 --> 01:19.660]  No.
[01:19.740 --> 01:26.320]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast. My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[01:26.320 --> 01:37.620]  This is episode 165. And you know, before you continue your pedantic little argument, let me say, I was thinking about this, and I think it's something that we need to start prefacing going forward.
[01:37.880 --> 01:47.440]  This is a 100% non-AI podcast. We are all humans saying human things written, or in this case, not written by other humans.
[01:48.000 --> 01:48.240]  Huh.
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.900]  It really makes me think you did something with AI for this episode.
[01:51.900 --> 02:04.660]  No, no, not at all, but I was just reading an article about... they were interviewing James Van Der Beek about he was saying that AI is going to destroy Hollywood and entertainment in general.
[02:04.820 --> 02:07.880]  And I just got to thinking, like, maybe that's true, maybe it's not, I don't know.
[02:08.300 --> 02:19.220]  But at some point pretty soon, like I don't know if you saw this, the other day, Ron DeSantis released a political ad where they AI'd Trump's voice saying shit that he didn't say.
[02:20.960 --> 02:26.340]  And there's just like no way to know whether it's true, like whether you're listening to somebody that's real or not at this point.
[02:26.420 --> 02:32.620]  So that, and you remember the other day, a couple months ago, when Jack showed us AI Eric saying eat the pencil or Eric Android the pencil or whatever?
[02:32.800 --> 02:34.900]  I would have bought, I would have bought it in a heartbeat.
[02:35.180 --> 02:42.960]  So my point being here is that I just want people to know as of, first off, as far as I know, every episode up to this point.
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.660]  And then from here on going forward, we're all humans.
[02:45.880 --> 02:47.380]  Well, here's what we have going for us.
[02:47.380 --> 02:55.800]  We could feed machine learning AI every single episode of F*** Face and there's no way it could ever know what Andrew's going to do next.
[02:56.820 --> 03:02.440]  Can I say, I also don't know what Andrew's going to do next because he just said in our chat, I'm rebooting.
[03:03.120 --> 03:07.080]  Oh, is he rebooting like he's doing an AI joke or he's physically rebooting his computer?
[03:08.420 --> 03:11.620]  Andrew's been weird today, man. We've been talking for a little while before the episode.
[03:11.800 --> 03:13.060]  I can't hear him. Is he speaking?
[03:13.060 --> 03:18.100]  He couldn't hear us before, then he could, and now he's rebooting.
[03:18.560 --> 03:20.360]  I haven't heard him say a single word.
[03:20.600 --> 03:21.840]  Well, you weren't here early.
[03:22.180 --> 03:23.720]  Yeah, he was saying words earlier. Don't worry.
[03:23.800 --> 03:24.920]  No, I just mean in the episode.
[03:26.240 --> 03:29.300]  Well, it's because he's rebooting. He can't talk and reboot at the same time.
[03:29.680 --> 03:33.760]  This is the worst episode we've made.
[03:35.320 --> 03:37.820]  Oh, that's a pretty low bar.
[03:39.260 --> 03:43.300]  Gavin, before the episode, Andrew just talked to me out of the blue.
[03:43.740 --> 03:45.740]  By the way, he hasn't talked to me in probably at least a week.
[03:46.000 --> 03:46.940]  Talked to me out of the blue.
[03:47.300 --> 03:49.380]  I texted you yesterday. What are you talking about?
[03:49.860 --> 03:52.080]  Where are you? Why do you sound like that?
[03:52.800 --> 03:54.000]  I'm on my phone.
[03:54.160 --> 03:54.400]  Are you inside of a Gerpler?
[03:55.020 --> 03:57.400]  I'm rebooting. Jesus Christ. Relax.
[03:57.520 --> 03:59.540]  Andrew's talking into a Gerpler on a string.
[03:59.780 --> 04:01.000]  Geoff, I texted you.
[04:04.280 --> 04:07.100]  This is what we get after Geoff says there's no AI in this episode.
[04:08.040 --> 04:09.320]  This is the sound we have.
[04:10.020 --> 04:10.960]  Well, what did he text you saying?
[04:11.620 --> 04:17.000]  He was being very conspicuous about asking if I thought this was a blindside episode, if it could be a blindside episode.
[04:17.520 --> 04:18.980]  I just gave him the warning.
[04:19.400 --> 04:20.800]  He sounded very blindside-y.
[04:21.020 --> 04:23.480]  And then the more he talked about it, the less I trusted him.
[04:23.540 --> 04:24.900]  And then the more he tried to convince me.
[04:25.100 --> 04:26.420]  And the less I trusted him.
[04:26.880 --> 04:28.820]  I just got out of the lab. I've been in the lab all morning.
[04:29.660 --> 04:30.600]  Oh, there he goes.
[04:32.680 --> 04:35.340]  This is... I don't even... Do we edit it?
[04:35.480 --> 04:36.900]  Like, what is this?
[04:37.540 --> 04:38.260]  What if...
[04:38.260 --> 04:39.700]  Here's a wild theory.
[04:40.200 --> 04:45.200]  I just declared that f***face is 100% human, non-AI.
[04:47.120 --> 04:51.900]  What if Andrew has been AI this entire time, and we just like...
[04:51.900 --> 04:54.640]  It's like the three laws of robotics in Isaac Asimov books.
[04:54.860 --> 04:56.540]  Like, we just broke one of the...
[04:56.540 --> 04:59.040]  Like, he now can't participate.
[04:59.040 --> 05:02.860]  And I just broke Andrew because he was never human to begin with.
[05:03.660 --> 05:05.060]  Huh. You might need a new disclaimer.
[05:05.640 --> 05:08.640]  You gave him like the Voight-Kampff test, and he just sort of like...
[05:08.640 --> 05:09.840]  He couldn't...
[05:09.840 --> 05:11.080]  He couldn't keep up.
[05:11.520 --> 05:13.780]  Yeah. Wow. This is...
[05:13.780 --> 05:15.600]  This is exactly like Blade Runner.
[05:15.880 --> 05:17.260]  I wanna... Unmute.
[05:17.920 --> 05:20.080]  It's just muted. Can you unmute me?
[05:20.560 --> 05:21.860]  Nick, can you...
[05:21.860 --> 05:23.400]  Uh... S***.
[05:23.880 --> 05:24.040]  Yeah.
[05:25.440 --> 05:26.840]  Now it's frozen.
[05:27.520 --> 05:29.720]  One of us was AI the entire time.
[05:31.720 --> 05:33.560]  Oh, Nick's muted him somehow?
[05:34.140 --> 05:35.860]  He's asking if you can unmute him.
[05:36.060 --> 05:37.440]  I thought that would be on him, though.
[05:37.680 --> 05:38.220]  Yeah, me too.
[05:38.680 --> 05:40.960]  Hey, Nick, can you brush Andrew's teeth while you're at it?
[05:42.320 --> 05:42.800]  He...
[05:42.800 --> 05:44.280]  He's not muted. No.
[05:44.840 --> 05:45.800]  What is happening?
[05:46.860 --> 05:47.660]  What is happening?
[05:48.040 --> 05:50.220]  Why are you asking... Oh, my God.
[05:51.920 --> 05:53.540]  Andrew wants to know what's happening.
[05:55.040 --> 05:55.540]  I'm...
[05:55.540 --> 05:56.920]  Gracie, it's not always like this.
[05:57.800 --> 05:59.120]  I don't believe that.
[06:01.140 --> 06:02.760]  Something tells me that's a lie.
[06:05.500 --> 06:07.920]  Is your mic working in anything else?
[06:08.100 --> 06:08.560]  He's gone.
[06:10.540 --> 06:11.540]  Reloading Discord.
[06:13.620 --> 06:15.340]  Andrew texted me. So close.
[06:16.060 --> 06:16.500]  That's good.
[06:16.800 --> 06:18.060]  He was just standing there and left again.
[06:18.060 --> 06:18.920]  He's back.
[06:19.080 --> 06:20.420]  He's unmuted.
[06:22.860 --> 06:24.080]  Andrew, please talk.
[06:24.660 --> 06:25.600]  I can see me talking.
[06:25.800 --> 06:26.940]  I wonder if the mic fell off the fridge.
[06:27.140 --> 06:28.100]  I can't hear you.
[06:30.860 --> 06:32.220]  We're going into deep lore.
[06:32.720 --> 06:33.120]  This is good.
[06:35.440 --> 06:36.820]  That was a Hail Mary.
[06:37.300 --> 06:38.800]  Come on, connect.
[06:40.840 --> 06:40.900]  Oh!
[06:41.940 --> 06:42.420]  Yes!
[06:43.860 --> 06:44.380]  Can you hear me?
[06:44.380 --> 06:45.080]  Yeah.
[06:45.520 --> 06:48.740]  Like he was never gone.
[06:49.400 --> 06:51.120]  Minute 20 of my recording.
[06:52.560 --> 06:56.300]  If you guys were here a little bit earlier, none of that would have happened.
[06:57.960 --> 07:01.020]  Five minutes, at least five minutes early, would you say, Nick?
[07:01.440 --> 07:03.040]  I looked at five minutes.
[07:04.200 --> 07:05.480]  What time was it?
[07:06.040 --> 07:06.480]  1255.
[07:07.180 --> 07:08.080]  No one was here.
[07:08.720 --> 07:11.580]  I swapped to a different tab to get my notes ready.
[07:12.100 --> 07:13.500]  And when I came back, everyone was here.
[07:13.500 --> 07:14.620]  I missed it.
[07:15.600 --> 07:18.560]  Yeah, I can't believe we did that to you.
[07:18.920 --> 07:21.620]  Are you saying you need us all to be five minutes early,
[07:21.820 --> 07:23.280]  otherwise you won't function correctly?
[07:23.920 --> 07:24.840]  No, so...
[07:24.840 --> 07:26.980]  Like if I don't arrive five minutes early to the restaurant,
[07:27.100 --> 07:29.000]  you'll just shit your pants the second I arrive and leave?
[07:29.260 --> 07:31.820]  What he's saying is we need to be earlier than five minutes.
[07:31.820 --> 07:33.580]  No, typically it's fine.
[07:34.300 --> 07:36.580]  What happened was I went into my settings
[07:36.580 --> 07:37.420]  on my computer,
[07:37.560 --> 07:40.460]  and it said you cannot access your audio settings.
[07:40.560 --> 07:41.640]  I thought, that's not good,
[07:41.640 --> 07:44.720]  because I'm defaulting to my speakers.
[07:45.260 --> 07:46.640]  But maybe in Discord,
[07:46.960 --> 07:48.920]  I can set it for my headphones.
[07:49.400 --> 07:50.080]  So I went into Discord,
[07:50.200 --> 07:51.100]  went into the audio settings,
[07:51.220 --> 07:54.180]  it said all good, your audio is being fed to your headphones,
[07:54.540 --> 07:56.580]  then that was clearly not the case
[07:56.580 --> 07:57.780]  when I went back to the tab
[07:57.780 --> 08:00.100]  and discovered that there were four people in here
[08:00.100 --> 08:01.460]  post 1255.
[08:02.160 --> 08:03.400]  And so I couldn't change it,
[08:03.420 --> 08:05.120]  because I couldn't change my audio output,
[08:05.380 --> 08:07.240]  and you guys are going through my computer speakers.
[08:07.620 --> 08:10.140]  Yeah, the chances of you actually recording the correct mic
[08:10.140 --> 08:12.220]  at this point is pretty slim, I think.
[08:12.680 --> 08:13.860]  No, I'm definitely, I'm all good.
[08:13.960 --> 08:16.180]  I'm looking at it in Audacity, I got the Scarlet Solo,
[08:16.340 --> 08:17.820]  everything's all set up, we're all fine.
[08:18.180 --> 08:20.100]  It was just that audio issue, we worked through it.
[08:20.520 --> 08:21.960]  Now we're here, how's everyone doing?
[08:22.440 --> 08:23.840]  Great, Gavin's been in the lab.
[08:24.080 --> 08:26.060]  Please tell me about being in the lab, I need to know.
[08:26.300 --> 08:28.000]  I've been itching for like 20 minutes.
[08:28.160 --> 08:29.360]  Please tell me about being in the lab.
[08:29.720 --> 08:30.820]  We also went to Vegas.
[08:31.280 --> 08:34.300]  You did go to Vegas! Yeah, I'm so sad I missed that.
[08:34.360 --> 08:35.780]  It was the big Bachelor part.
[08:35.880 --> 08:37.640]  Tell me about Vegas, what happened to Vegas.
[08:38.300 --> 08:40.720]  I don't know, I kind of want to know what's going on in the lab first.
[08:40.760 --> 08:41.820]  Tell me about the lab!
[08:41.940 --> 08:44.380]  Okay, I guess we're doing the lab first.
[08:44.880 --> 08:45.380]  Yeah, okay.
[08:45.780 --> 08:46.980]  Wait, is the episode starting now?
[08:48.040 --> 08:49.540]  It started a little bit ago.
[08:50.020 --> 08:51.320]  How far are we into this episode?
[08:51.320 --> 08:52.960]  TELL US ABOUT THE FUCKING LAB, DUDE!
[08:53.540 --> 08:56.120]  Sorry, man. Okay, so this is a
[08:56.120 --> 08:57.640]  Uniform creation from...
[09:02.130 --> 09:03.290]  I was in lab 2.
[09:03.310 --> 09:05.110]  You had 20 minutes of Andrew Fump!
[09:05.310 --> 09:07.610]  From the mind of Whoop Scoop.
[09:07.610 --> 09:09.590]  This is the official Whoop Scoop logo.
[09:10.470 --> 09:11.070]  Well, yeah.
[09:11.450 --> 09:13.570]  And what we're working on today, everyone, is
[09:13.570 --> 09:15.250]  Oh, my favorites folder.
[09:15.870 --> 09:17.330]  I thought you built that in the lab.
[09:17.410 --> 09:18.710]  I thought that was the creation.
[09:18.890 --> 09:21.510]  No, that would have been cooler. That was just on a wall somewhere.
[09:21.650 --> 09:22.230]  That was in Vegas.
[09:23.730 --> 09:26.650]  So, the plan was
[09:26.650 --> 09:29.730]  to create a glove that acts like a
[09:29.730 --> 09:30.710]  hand warmer
[09:31.330 --> 09:33.550]  so I can put my hand in the glove, activate
[09:33.550 --> 09:35.310]  it, and suddenly I've got a hot hand
[09:35.310 --> 09:36.990]  to carve through ice cream.
[09:37.730 --> 09:39.090]  So I thought, it's simple.
[09:39.390 --> 09:41.350]  It's getting a bunch of, you know, those liquid hand
[09:41.350 --> 09:43.430]  warmers and stuffing all of
[09:43.430 --> 09:45.070]  the liquid in a glove.
[09:45.510 --> 09:47.610]  Wrong! It immediately oxidizes
[09:47.610 --> 09:49.730]  with the air and solidifies.
[09:53.170 --> 09:55.390]  So I ended up looking like I had
[09:55.390 --> 09:57.450]  a bunch of chopped pineapple in a
[09:57.450 --> 09:58.450]  food glove.
[10:01.070 --> 10:02.250]  But don't worry!
[10:02.250 --> 10:03.810]  But don't worry,
[10:04.350 --> 10:04.830]  because
[10:05.750 --> 10:07.730]  you can boil that shit
[10:08.250 --> 10:10.190]  and I did it on a saucepan
[10:10.190 --> 10:12.110]  outside so I didn't gas my...
[10:12.110 --> 10:13.630]  By the way, I think I've poisoned myself.
[10:14.030 --> 10:15.010]  Anyway, moving on.
[10:15.690 --> 10:17.990]  I managed to reset the entire
[10:18.490 --> 10:20.190]  hand warmer back
[10:20.190 --> 10:21.950]  into its liquid form. And here it is.
[10:22.130 --> 10:23.850]  And you can see I've left in a little metal tab
[10:23.850 --> 10:26.170]  that you're supposed to squeeze to set it off
[10:26.170 --> 10:27.110]  being hot again.
[10:28.150 --> 10:29.230]  Now, slight problem.
[10:29.230 --> 10:31.310]  Well, I should say, next, I wanted to put
[10:31.310 --> 10:32.870]  the glove I was gonna wear
[10:32.870 --> 10:35.230]  inside that. But I couldn't figure out how
[10:35.230 --> 10:37.170]  to do that because it was too hot
[10:37.170 --> 10:38.850]  to put my actual hand in currently.
[10:39.170 --> 10:41.190]  So I created a
[10:41.190 --> 10:42.950]  dummy hand mold
[10:42.950 --> 10:45.130]  which I made out of a glove
[10:45.130 --> 10:47.250]  full of water. So that's standing in for my
[10:47.250 --> 10:49.490]  hand. Didn't realize,
[10:49.990 --> 10:51.150]  as you can see in that picture,
[10:51.270 --> 10:53.310]  there's some white ooze now coming out
[10:53.310 --> 10:53.990]  of the other one.
[10:55.630 --> 10:56.270]  It's leaking.
[10:56.270 --> 10:57.190]  It's leaking.
[10:57.490 --> 11:00.010]  It left a big stain on the couch
[11:00.010 --> 11:00.730]  I put it on.
[11:05.380 --> 11:06.640]  So I quickly had to
[11:06.640 --> 11:08.680]  deal with it. I opened it up. I was trying to stuff
[11:08.680 --> 11:10.500]  the water glove up the hand warmer
[11:10.500 --> 11:10.880]  glove.
[11:11.060 --> 11:13.800]  It looks like a hungry duck.
[11:15.580 --> 11:16.240]  It's like a
[11:16.240 --> 11:18.260]  rabid duck. It's foaming at the mouth.
[11:19.620 --> 11:20.620]  The thumb, by the way,
[11:20.680 --> 11:22.100]  is stuck underneath. I couldn't
[11:22.100 --> 11:24.480]  get access to the thumb. But I was
[11:24.480 --> 11:26.320]  hoping that when I stuffed the water glove in
[11:26.320 --> 11:28.360]  the warm glove, everything would be
[11:28.360 --> 11:29.300]  fine and go back to normal.
[11:29.740 --> 11:32.360]  So all the water in the heat warmer juice spilled
[11:32.360 --> 11:34.400]  all over the place and I ended up with
[11:34.400 --> 11:36.360]  a glove with a crumpled
[11:36.360 --> 11:38.500]  up other glove in the top of it
[11:38.500 --> 11:40.240]  while all the fingers
[11:40.240 --> 11:42.540]  are slowly turning back into the hard
[11:43.740 --> 11:44.260]  material.
[11:44.900 --> 11:46.280]  It's all going
[11:46.280 --> 11:48.340]  wrong and this is the
[11:48.340 --> 11:50.100]  stain that it left on my patio.
[11:52.000 --> 11:53.240]  So all in all,
[11:53.240 --> 11:55.000]  this ended about
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.240]  25 minutes ago, by the way. I burnt the shit out
[11:57.240 --> 11:59.260]  of myself. I inhaled a lot
[11:59.260 --> 12:01.080]  of fumes and
[12:01.080 --> 12:02.940]  hopefully I lost the
[12:02.940 --> 12:05.000]  double recording we have today. So I'd say
[12:05.700 --> 12:07.220]  incredibly unsuccessful day
[12:07.220 --> 12:08.560]  in the lab, but I think
[12:09.100 --> 12:11.200]  I've proved the concept. I just need to
[12:11.200 --> 12:13.220]  pour the liquid very
[12:13.220 --> 12:15.300]  quickly or sort of grind up the
[12:15.300 --> 12:17.220]  hard stuff and get the gloves
[12:17.220 --> 12:19.280]  settled before I go to the
[12:19.280 --> 12:21.160]  boil phase. And I think I can do that.
[12:21.160 --> 12:22.900]  Do you think
[12:22.900 --> 12:24.420]  maybe you need a
[12:25.260 --> 12:26.820]  tougher glove? It's possible.
[12:27.440 --> 12:29.100]  Yeah, do you remember the gloves you used to use
[12:29.100 --> 12:31.080]  to wash dishes back when you lived
[12:31.080 --> 12:32.920]  with me? Yeah. Those were like a heavier
[12:32.920 --> 12:34.980]  duty glove. Like some marigolds?
[12:35.080 --> 12:36.920]  Well, I wanted to see through them. I thought that'd be cool.
[12:37.120 --> 12:39.040]  But yeah, I couldn't use those. That's true, for sure.
[12:39.480 --> 12:41.020]  Yeah, it adds to the cosmetics.
[12:41.040 --> 12:43.080]  So what is the actual goal here? What is the
[12:43.080 --> 12:45.060]  end product? To be able
[12:45.060 --> 12:46.820]  to put my hand into the
[12:46.820 --> 12:48.620]  ice cream gloves. Okay.
[12:48.620 --> 12:50.780]  And activate the whoop scoop
[12:50.780 --> 12:52.480]  so that I can claw
[12:52.480 --> 12:54.640]  ice cream out of the tub with my hand
[12:54.640 --> 12:56.240]  into a bowl. Okay.
[12:56.700 --> 12:58.560]  And then I boil the glove afterwards.
[13:00.080 --> 13:00.640]  I think
[13:00.640 --> 13:02.240]  that's a brilliant idea. Yeah.
[13:02.720 --> 13:04.780]  I mean, it is an idea, for sure.
[13:05.200 --> 13:06.460]  Right. Have you considered
[13:06.460 --> 13:08.100]  a spoon for the ice cream?
[13:08.300 --> 13:10.620]  We've talked about this, dude! Ice cream sometimes is
[13:10.620 --> 13:12.540]  too cold for spoons, and we were talking about how we
[13:12.540 --> 13:14.480]  wanted a heated spoon, and then Gavin
[13:14.480 --> 13:16.720]  came up with the idea for the gloves. Yeah, that's fair.
[13:16.720 --> 13:18.160]  That's fair. I'm just...
[13:18.160 --> 13:20.760]  And it was following along the lines of the fruit gloves,
[13:20.960 --> 13:22.540]  which I don't think we ever got, but it
[13:22.960 --> 13:24.840]  inspired me to go forward with ice cream
[13:24.840 --> 13:26.720]  gloves. You know, I had a minor breakthrough
[13:26.720 --> 13:28.720]  in the fruit gloves the other day. Did you?
[13:29.520 --> 13:30.740]  Yeah, I need to get back to it, because
[13:30.740 --> 13:32.740]  I saw something that inspired me. Oh.
[13:33.440 --> 13:34.600]  Okay, so you don't want to say it now.
[13:34.680 --> 13:36.620]  This is lab work. No, no, no. I don't want to ruin it. Yeah.
[13:36.720 --> 13:38.620]  Let me get into the lab work on it. But I'll
[13:38.620 --> 13:40.780]  also be honest with you. I'm a little inspired by what
[13:40.780 --> 13:42.780]  Gavin's going through right now. Like, he's in the
[13:42.780 --> 13:44.420]  frustrating part of it, but it's like
[13:44.420 --> 13:46.500]  magic is happening in front of our eyes.
[13:47.320 --> 13:48.480]  He is learning how
[13:48.480 --> 13:50.400]  not to make them. We've now seen
[13:50.400 --> 13:52.300]  several attempts of how not to do it.
[13:52.360 --> 13:54.600]  You're narrowing it down. I'm learning.
[13:54.820 --> 13:56.220]  I've learned a lot in the last
[13:56.220 --> 13:58.420]  hour. You can't
[13:59.180 --> 14:00.540]  make an omelette without breaking
[14:00.540 --> 14:01.980]  a few gloves. We know that.
[14:02.280 --> 14:04.040]  Yeah, or a couch or the patio.
[14:05.040 --> 14:06.500]  Are you in trouble with Mag? Did she
[14:06.500 --> 14:08.480]  yell at you? Well, I'm pretty sure I can
[14:08.480 --> 14:10.400]  just boil it back to liquid.
[14:10.880 --> 14:11.460]  I don't know how to do it.
[14:16.120 --> 14:16.740]  You know,
[14:16.880 --> 14:18.460]  I'll let her know later, depending on
[14:18.460 --> 14:19.440]  how the clean up goes.
[14:20.660 --> 14:22.520]  She can't be mad at what she doesn't
[14:22.520 --> 14:23.060]  see, right?
[14:24.520 --> 14:26.600]  Just walk her around those parts of the house.
[14:29.000 --> 14:30.140]  That's like when I was a kid,
[14:30.500 --> 14:32.420]  I gave myself a rat tail one
[14:32.420 --> 14:34.380]  time, and my mom was
[14:34.380 --> 14:36.420]  not cool with me having one, but this is like the early
[14:36.420 --> 14:38.560]  80s, so I needed to have one, or
[14:38.560 --> 14:40.140]  otherwise I just couldn't go to school.
[14:41.180 --> 14:42.240]  And so, I didn't feel
[14:42.240 --> 14:44.280]  like a fucking dude. I was sitting in my bedroom one night,
[14:44.740 --> 14:46.420]  and I was watching Knight Rider,
[14:46.900 --> 14:48.500]  and fucking...
[14:48.500 --> 14:50.500]  David Hasselhoff was so cool.
[14:51.160 --> 14:52.520]  He was such a fucking badass,
[14:52.740 --> 14:54.480]  and he took no shit from nobody,
[14:54.700 --> 14:56.120]  and during a commercial break,
[14:56.220 --> 14:58.220]  I fucking psyched myself up, and I went into the
[14:58.220 --> 14:59.900]  bathroom, and I gave myself a rat tail,
[15:00.100 --> 15:02.380]  and then I immediately did not feel like a badass.
[15:02.480 --> 15:03.740]  I felt like I was going to get in trouble,
[15:04.080 --> 15:05.580]  and so I just didn't turn
[15:06.200 --> 15:08.540]  my back to my mom for four days
[15:08.540 --> 15:09.240]  before she caught me.
[15:10.620 --> 15:11.260]  She caught me
[15:11.260 --> 15:13.360]  on a Thursday. I did it on a
[15:13.360 --> 15:13.660]  Sunday.
[15:15.060 --> 15:17.240]  Anyway, it worked for me, and it'll probably work
[15:17.240 --> 15:18.200]  for you and Meg. Just walk her
[15:19.060 --> 15:20.380]  around the other side of the house, or whatever.
[15:20.980 --> 15:22.920]  What was the endgame on the rat tail?
[15:23.300 --> 15:25.260]  Did she ever find out? Yeah, she caught
[15:25.260 --> 15:27.300]  me, and I was... I actually... I don't know
[15:27.300 --> 15:28.940]  why I remember this so well. I was going
[15:28.940 --> 15:30.860]  into our pantry.
[15:31.320 --> 15:33.160]  Well, not pantry. It was like a cabinet. Going into our pantry
[15:33.160 --> 15:35.320]  because we had these Teddy Grahams that were
[15:35.320 --> 15:37.300]  Return of the Jedi-like Teddy Grahams
[15:37.300 --> 15:39.180]  that had just come out, and they were like little
[15:39.180 --> 15:41.360]  Ewok things, and I wanted some, and I
[15:41.360 --> 15:43.240]  was so fucking jazzed about them, because we had just
[15:43.240 --> 15:45.380]  gotten them, that I turned around, and my mom
[15:45.380 --> 15:47.080]  goes, what is that? And I was like, ah!
[15:47.260 --> 15:49.320]  Fuck! I didn't say fuck, because I'd have a
[15:49.320 --> 15:51.380]  triple in trouble. But I was like, ah!
[15:51.660 --> 15:53.420]  And then she was impressed that I got
[15:53.420 --> 15:55.380]  away with it for as long as I did. I think she made me cut
[15:55.380 --> 15:56.900]  it, but I didn't get in trouble.
[15:58.140 --> 15:59.320]  What does it say about
[15:59.320 --> 16:01.460]  me that my mom gave us
[16:01.460 --> 16:03.120]  rat tails in the early days?
[16:04.160 --> 16:05.260]  It just checks out.
[16:05.260 --> 16:07.420]  You're the rat cat. I think it says
[16:07.420 --> 16:08.500]  everything about you.
[16:09.160 --> 16:10.740]  I just really...
[16:10.740 --> 16:12.360]  That's some white trash stuff, man.
[16:13.340 --> 16:15.400]  I feel like your mom would have just tried to make you
[16:15.400 --> 16:17.280]  look like the kid in the Crossfire
[16:17.280 --> 16:19.240]  commercial. That would have been
[16:19.240 --> 16:21.380]  awesome. I would have loved to have been
[16:21.380 --> 16:22.720]  the kid in the Crossfire commercial.
[16:23.100 --> 16:24.520]  Oh man, that's awesome.
[16:25.160 --> 16:26.360]  Anyone else been in the lab this week?
[16:27.720 --> 16:29.420]  I've been in the lab. Should I do my lab
[16:29.420 --> 16:30.600]  stuff now? I want to hear about Vegas.
[16:32.160 --> 16:33.400]  Well, this is
[16:33.400 --> 16:35.180]  apparently the lab episode. Let's get into the lab.
[16:35.920 --> 16:37.500]  Do you want to get into the lab stuff?
[16:38.180 --> 16:39.120]  I think so.
[16:40.480 --> 16:41.280]  Okay, well...
[16:41.280 --> 16:43.480]  We can't go lab, Vegas, lab. We won't finish
[16:43.480 --> 16:45.480]  the episode. Let's go lab, lab, Vegas.
[16:46.100 --> 16:47.360]  Second of all, how far into
[16:47.360 --> 16:49.300]  this episode are we? What minute mark are we?
[16:49.320 --> 16:51.120]  I'm very disoriented. Probably right around
[16:51.120 --> 16:53.240]  10, I would think. I think we're probably
[16:53.240 --> 16:54.080]  closer to 15.
[16:55.460 --> 16:57.460]  Okay, we're 15 minutes
[16:57.460 --> 16:59.460]  in. So I went into the lab.
[17:00.000 --> 17:01.480]  Gavin and I shared each other
[17:01.480 --> 17:03.080]  a little lab tease earlier.
[17:04.320 --> 17:05.200]  I've wanted
[17:05.200 --> 17:07.180]  to do this for a while.
[17:07.860 --> 17:09.580]  This has been in lab development
[17:09.580 --> 17:10.940]  for a long time. R&D,
[17:11.460 --> 17:13.340]  as they say. I'm going to
[17:13.340 --> 17:15.380]  show you guys something and you're going to tell me
[17:15.380 --> 17:16.600]  what you see.
[17:17.420 --> 17:19.640]  Putting a photo in right now.
[17:20.340 --> 17:21.240]  What do you guys see?
[17:22.060 --> 17:23.260]  What are you looking at here?
[17:23.380 --> 17:25.400]  Use your eyes. Use your soul.
[17:25.540 --> 17:27.280]  What do you see? It's pool noodles.
[17:27.760 --> 17:29.320]  Pool noodles. You see pool noodles?
[17:30.820 --> 17:31.580]  What do you see,
[17:31.800 --> 17:32.900]  Geoff? I see
[17:34.040 --> 17:34.840]  rake sleeves.
[17:35.420 --> 17:37.240]  Rake sleeves? Yeah, I saw a TikTok
[17:37.240 --> 17:39.420]  where this dude sprayed WD-40 in those
[17:39.420 --> 17:41.380]  things and then you put it on your rake and then
[17:41.380 --> 17:42.940]  it's more comfortable to rake with.
[17:43.320 --> 17:45.040]  Oh, I see
[17:45.680 --> 17:47.320]  like a super
[17:47.320 --> 17:48.280]  sized fries.
[17:49.620 --> 17:50.880]  Super sized fries?
[17:51.460 --> 17:53.200]  Oh, I see. I see what you're saying. Okay, you're getting
[17:53.200 --> 17:54.640]  artistic. You're doing some interpretation.
[17:55.900 --> 17:57.320]  It's not the right direction.
[17:57.320 --> 17:59.400]  Oh shit! Is it sleep
[17:59.400 --> 18:01.240]  spaghetti? It's
[18:01.240 --> 18:02.740]  sleep spaghetti.
[18:03.040 --> 18:05.420]  Oh my god! You've been sleeping on
[18:05.420 --> 18:07.480]  it. Sleep spaghetti. I've been waiting
[18:07.480 --> 18:09.280]  for the summer so the dollar
[18:09.280 --> 18:11.300]  store could get some noodles in because I
[18:11.300 --> 18:13.460]  needed a base thing and they're expensive
[18:13.460 --> 18:14.980]  otherwise. They cost a lot of money.
[18:15.840 --> 18:16.960]  Sleep spaghetti.
[18:17.460 --> 18:19.220]  We have the prototype. That's the base.
[18:19.300 --> 18:21.200]  We got the pool noodles there as
[18:21.200 --> 18:23.560]  needed. It became a problem
[18:23.560 --> 18:25.560]  of fabric is expensive as well.
[18:25.560 --> 18:27.240]  What do you use for fabric?
[18:27.320 --> 18:29.240]  How would you solve this?
[18:29.300 --> 18:31.300]  What is your solution for this problem?
[18:31.380 --> 18:33.600]  We have the noodles. What would you do?
[18:33.720 --> 18:35.680]  I'll tell you what I did. I'll show you right
[18:35.680 --> 18:37.480]  now. Put a photo of it. Put it in.
[18:38.360 --> 18:40.000]  Sleep fucking spaghetti.
[18:40.280 --> 18:40.420]  Okay?
[18:41.000 --> 18:43.680]  Got some socks. Got some cheap
[18:44.320 --> 18:45.200]  Got some
[18:45.900 --> 18:46.340]  cheap
[18:48.820 --> 18:49.880]  I got some
[18:49.880 --> 18:51.800]  There's a bunch of heels
[18:51.800 --> 18:52.660]  all the way up.
[18:52.660 --> 18:53.780]  Yeah, because
[18:54.480 --> 18:55.780]  I bought some socks
[18:56.600 --> 18:57.640]  and you chop
[18:58.300 --> 19:00.560]  the top off the sock and then you
[19:00.560 --> 19:02.680]  slide it down. It covers that sleep
[19:02.680 --> 19:04.640]  spaghetti. You get the sleep spaghetti
[19:04.640 --> 19:06.680]  going nice and good. Okay?
[19:08.020 --> 19:08.680]  This is
[19:08.680 --> 19:10.580]  a hard day's work. Okay?
[19:11.040 --> 19:11.980]  For research and development.
[19:12.500 --> 19:15.040]  This is the bed. All nice and cozy.
[19:15.440 --> 19:16.220]  You get them laid out.
[19:16.760 --> 19:18.840]  This is an idea we've been talking about for a long
[19:18.840 --> 19:20.780]  time. I built sleep
[19:20.780 --> 19:23.140]  spaghetti and I'm ready for your questions.
[19:24.800 --> 19:26.800]  Let me start. Did I sleep
[19:26.800 --> 19:28.340]  well? No. Continue.
[19:28.720 --> 19:29.480]  Other questions.
[19:35.040 --> 19:36.880]  I didn't come up with it.
[19:36.960 --> 19:38.460]  I just wanted to finalize it.
[19:39.000 --> 19:39.840]  I saw it.
[19:41.880 --> 19:44.580]  Why is it so much more horrific
[19:44.580 --> 19:45.860]  than it sounded originally?
[19:46.600 --> 19:48.860]  Well, I mean, a number of
[19:48.860 --> 19:50.840]  reasons. He has sleep
[19:50.840 --> 19:52.440]  uncooked spaghetti.
[19:52.660 --> 19:55.140]  This is the noodle before it's
[19:55.140 --> 19:56.720]  wet. You're just
[19:56.720 --> 19:58.860]  sleeping on dry noodles.
[19:59.320 --> 20:00.960]  I think sleep spaghetti is a thing
[20:00.960 --> 20:02.280]  you can like sink into.
[20:02.580 --> 20:03.020]  Andrew,
[20:04.060 --> 20:06.860]  Andrew, this is
[20:07.540 --> 20:09.000]  also brilliant. It's also
[20:09.000 --> 20:10.900]  watching magic happen in front of us.
[20:11.240 --> 20:12.940]  Right now, your spaghetti is
[20:12.940 --> 20:13.880]  too al dente.
[20:13.880 --> 20:14.720]  Oh.
[20:16.020 --> 20:18.080]  It needs to go back in the pot
[20:18.080 --> 20:20.400]  for another ten minutes.
[20:20.920 --> 20:21.940]  That was your
[20:21.940 --> 20:23.980]  vision was more... I feel like a
[20:23.980 --> 20:26.000]  firm noodle. I like my noodles
[20:26.000 --> 20:28.020]  firm. So surely
[20:28.020 --> 20:30.060]  you're slipping immediately
[20:30.060 --> 20:30.740]  through those.
[20:31.680 --> 20:33.840]  Okay, so what you do
[20:33.840 --> 20:35.900]  is you push them to
[20:35.900 --> 20:38.020]  the side. Then you lay down.
[20:38.340 --> 20:39.940]  Then you feel like a
[20:39.940 --> 20:41.760]  building has fallen on top of you.
[20:41.760 --> 20:43.340]  And you don't move.
[20:44.680 --> 20:45.940]  That's the first phase
[20:45.940 --> 20:47.740]  of comfort with the
[20:47.740 --> 20:48.260]  sleep spaghetti.
[20:49.760 --> 20:51.680]  No matter how you lay,
[20:51.800 --> 20:53.900]  it's sort of a problem. If you lay on your back,
[20:53.960 --> 20:55.700]  you feel like you're in Gulliver's Travels.
[20:55.920 --> 20:57.640]  You just feel like you're locked in
[20:57.640 --> 20:59.340]  and you're being held down.
[20:59.500 --> 21:01.800]  If you lay on your side, you feel
[21:01.800 --> 21:03.460]  like a skate ramp is
[21:03.460 --> 21:05.040]  being built off of you.
[21:05.380 --> 21:07.960]  It's a real problem. Other issues
[21:07.960 --> 21:09.360]  that I did not foresee
[21:09.360 --> 21:11.400]  with the sleep spaghetti setup.
[21:12.120 --> 21:13.620]  You can very easily,
[21:13.760 --> 21:15.500]  which I did, knock everything
[21:15.500 --> 21:17.360]  off of your end table trying to
[21:17.360 --> 21:19.580]  adjust a piece of sleep spaghetti
[21:19.580 --> 21:21.120]  because it is a very
[21:21.120 --> 21:23.060]  solid, long piece
[21:23.060 --> 21:25.300]  of foam, I guess. I'm not
[21:25.300 --> 21:27.400]  exactly sure what the material is, but
[21:27.400 --> 21:29.520]  it's solid. And it's not comfy.
[21:30.740 --> 21:33.360]  Can you just imagine if we started episode
[21:33.360 --> 21:35.440]  one with that couple of sentences?
[21:35.700 --> 21:37.020]  How insane that would sound.
[21:38.480 --> 21:39.100]  How what
[21:39.100 --> 21:39.500]  would sound?
[21:41.360 --> 21:43.020]  This is so deep
[21:43.020 --> 21:44.140]  into the lore of nothing.
[21:45.740 --> 21:46.620]  Good lord.
[21:47.480 --> 21:48.940]  And the pillows, for some reason,
[21:49.060 --> 21:50.300]  just look disgusting.
[21:50.860 --> 21:53.100]  Why is everything about that so unappealing?
[21:53.900 --> 21:55.280]  What do you mean? It's just a pile of pillows.
[21:55.740 --> 21:57.100]  Yeah, but they're sort of like off
[21:57.100 --> 21:59.260]  white and they're getting progressively darker.
[21:59.660 --> 22:01.360]  You know what? Yeah, get them, Gavin,
[22:01.440 --> 22:02.360]  get them. No, no.
[22:02.880 --> 22:04.600]  Calm down, rabid duck guy.
[22:04.600 --> 22:06.660]  Okay, I don't want to hear it. You got a fucking rabid
[22:06.660 --> 22:08.820]  duck on your couch. It's true.
[22:09.020 --> 22:10.640]  You got fucking mangoes dried up
[22:10.640 --> 22:12.520]  on your patio. I don't want to hear
[22:12.520 --> 22:14.380]  this nonsense about Pillow Mountain.
[22:14.780 --> 22:16.640]  I think he's just got some that
[22:16.640 --> 22:18.440]  are cream colored and some that are white.
[22:18.780 --> 22:20.960]  You got different colors, you got different shades.
[22:21.300 --> 22:22.780]  You got all sorts of options.
[22:23.260 --> 22:24.720]  I think it looks, I think
[22:24.720 --> 22:26.700]  the pillows look weird because the
[22:26.700 --> 22:28.420]  sleep spaghetti is so
[22:28.420 --> 22:30.440]  unsettling to look at
[22:30.440 --> 22:32.800]  that everything else just makes you question
[22:32.800 --> 22:33.860]  what we're doing here.
[22:35.060 --> 22:36.860]  It's rough stuff, man.
[22:36.920 --> 22:38.060]  I don't know about this.
[22:38.620 --> 22:40.560]  So, yeah,
[22:40.680 --> 22:42.520]  they really dry your eyes to the pillow.
[22:43.680 --> 22:44.720]  So, I
[22:44.720 --> 22:46.720]  would say, not wanting to
[22:46.720 --> 22:48.760]  throw, because I do think the pasta's too
[22:48.760 --> 22:49.480]  al dente, right?
[22:50.300 --> 22:52.880]  But I think not wanting to start from scratch, right?
[22:52.960 --> 22:54.460]  And to take what you've already built.
[22:54.780 --> 22:56.700]  First of all, I think maybe
[22:56.700 --> 22:58.600]  the next step would be
[22:58.600 --> 22:59.960]  to take the noodles
[22:59.960 --> 23:01.600]  and cut them
[23:01.600 --> 23:02.220]  maybe
[23:03.680 --> 23:05.860]  four times per noodle, and then
[23:05.860 --> 23:07.700]  stack them back in so there's more
[23:07.700 --> 23:09.940]  flexibility with them, so that you can
[23:09.940 --> 23:11.620]  manipulate them a little bit better, you see what I'm saying?
[23:11.860 --> 23:13.660]  They're not gonna be any softer, but they'll be more
[23:13.660 --> 23:15.820]  formable. So, like, separate them
[23:15.820 --> 23:17.800]  within the sock, you mean? Yeah, like
[23:17.800 --> 23:19.780]  separate them in the sock, but then have the
[23:19.780 --> 23:21.440]  socks bind them together
[23:21.820 --> 23:23.660]  so that way it acts more like
[23:24.440 --> 23:25.580]  you're creating, like,
[23:25.740 --> 23:27.960]  you're creating spaghetti
[23:27.960 --> 23:29.980]  elbows. Maybe you could make use of
[23:29.980 --> 23:32.100]  the heels if they're in chunks as well.
[23:33.700 --> 23:35.660]  How many socks did you ruin?
[23:36.180 --> 23:38.080]  Well, no. We're gonna get to that, okay?
[23:38.640 --> 23:40.160]  What? I didn't ruin
[23:40.800 --> 23:42.200]  any socks, okay?
[23:42.240 --> 23:43.960]  This is really simple. I'm glad
[23:43.960 --> 23:46.140]  you brought this up, because we have several innovations.
[23:46.680 --> 23:47.940]  Okay? So this is...
[23:47.940 --> 23:49.340]  Look at this. Pants.
[23:50.180 --> 23:52.040]  Okay? Pants. That's a pair of pants
[23:52.040 --> 23:54.380]  I just posted a photo of. That's a pair of pants, yeah.
[23:54.460 --> 23:55.580]  Yeah. A pair of shorts.
[23:55.580 --> 23:57.600]  That's a pair of shorts I just sent a photo of.
[23:58.020 --> 23:59.780]  Socks. Okay?
[24:00.560 --> 24:00.680]  Yeah.
[24:01.380 --> 24:03.160]  Shocks. Look at that.
[24:03.880 --> 24:05.780]  Toe-less socks.
[24:06.000 --> 24:07.860]  I realized I hate pants
[24:07.860 --> 24:09.440]  because I feel
[24:09.440 --> 24:11.780]  confined with my legs.
[24:12.380 --> 24:13.260]  So by
[24:13.260 --> 24:15.860]  cutting the toes off of the sock,
[24:16.080 --> 24:17.720]  my toes now
[24:17.720 --> 24:19.800]  have a freedom which makes me
[24:19.800 --> 24:21.660]  a sock guy. Not a sock guy.
[24:21.860 --> 24:23.020]  A shocks guy.
[24:23.020 --> 24:24.700]  I would wear these.
[24:24.880 --> 24:27.240]  I would enjoy these. I'm going to experiment with these.
[24:27.380 --> 24:28.880]  I think it's two for one.
[24:29.360 --> 24:31.240]  So it's not that I ruined socks.
[24:31.340 --> 24:33.220]  I actually made shocks, which is
[24:33.220 --> 24:34.880]  in my opinion, a superior
[24:34.880 --> 24:37.220]  product. And that's shorts? Socks?
[24:37.480 --> 24:38.740]  Short socks. Shocks.
[24:39.320 --> 24:40.860]  Do you have any
[24:40.860 --> 24:42.400]  examples of people wearing shocks?
[24:42.860 --> 24:44.860]  Uh, no. I do not.
[24:45.080 --> 24:46.920]  I have not put them on because it felt weird
[24:46.920 --> 24:49.080]  to send a foot pic. That goes behind
[24:49.080 --> 24:51.020]  the paywall. Maybe if there's a first
[24:51.020 --> 24:52.540]  situation later,
[24:52.740 --> 24:54.600]  we can experiment with that idea.
[24:55.160 --> 24:56.880]  So it's more of a hand. It could also be
[24:56.880 --> 24:58.540]  fingerless gloves, as I'm displaying.
[24:58.900 --> 25:01.200]  Do you think that they'd slip around though?
[25:01.620 --> 25:02.980]  Slip around? Uh...
[25:02.980 --> 25:04.320]  Yeah, like they wouldn't stay in place.
[25:04.760 --> 25:06.240]  They're snug, aren't they?
[25:06.700 --> 25:08.460]  When you pull a sock up, isn't it snug?
[25:08.780 --> 25:10.060]  Yeah, they're pretty snug.
[25:10.460 --> 25:12.840]  It's like a high sock. I feel like the
[25:12.840 --> 25:13.900]  heel would really grip.
[25:14.820 --> 25:17.120]  You just need the right shoe.
[25:17.120 --> 25:18.140]  Oh.
[25:19.780 --> 25:21.600]  Oh, for God's sake, Garrett.
[25:21.600 --> 25:23.120]  I'm even sick about doubling down.
[25:25.440 --> 25:27.860]  Toe-less shoes is an interesting idea.
[25:28.260 --> 25:28.780]  Idiot.
[25:28.920 --> 25:30.380]  That being said, he's got
[25:30.920 --> 25:32.300]  some form of shock there.
[25:32.880 --> 25:35.260]  I sent a funny picture. That was me being
[25:35.260 --> 25:37.420]  funny. But, just so you know,
[25:37.560 --> 25:38.240]  it is a thing.
[25:38.940 --> 25:40.900]  Yeah. That's great.
[25:41.300 --> 25:43.040]  They're called Opetoes.
[25:43.100 --> 25:44.860]  O-P-E-T-O-Z.
[25:44.860 --> 25:46.900]  I don't want to promote them, but that is what
[25:46.900 --> 25:47.480]  they are real.
[25:48.700 --> 25:50.880]  For your shocks, you can
[25:50.880 --> 25:53.140]  get Opetoes.
[25:53.680 --> 25:54.080]  Shoes?
[25:54.500 --> 25:54.760]  What?
[25:57.040 --> 25:59.100]  Yeah, I guess it's just
[26:00.160 --> 26:00.560]  shoes.
[26:00.900 --> 26:02.080]  I guess I could just get shoes.
[26:02.920 --> 26:04.820]  Fuck. But maybe an extra
[26:04.820 --> 26:05.700]  S. Shoes.
[26:07.280 --> 26:08.840]  Differentiate, because it is kind of confusing.
[26:10.300 --> 26:11.060]  I'll wear them.
[26:11.980 --> 26:12.740]  I'll wear them.
[26:12.740 --> 26:14.360]  I'll test that. I will say, before we
[26:14.360 --> 26:16.140]  venture too far past Sleep Spaghetti,
[26:16.560 --> 26:17.860]  on the positive side,
[26:18.740 --> 26:20.700]  I have never felt more prepared
[26:20.700 --> 26:22.140]  for a flood while sleeping.
[26:24.900 --> 26:26.460]  It's never crossed my mind.
[26:26.660 --> 26:28.480]  But I was in bed, I was laying, I was wrapped
[26:28.480 --> 26:30.300]  around it, and I thought, you know what?
[26:30.360 --> 26:32.520]  If a flood occurred, I feel
[26:32.520 --> 26:34.460]  very ready. I think you'd be the last person
[26:34.460 --> 26:36.220]  to find out. I probably would.
[26:36.640 --> 26:38.500]  You wouldn't find out until your nose hit the ceiling.
[26:39.100 --> 26:40.520]  I wouldn't find out until my
[26:40.520 --> 26:42.580]  AirPods fell out of my ears and the rain
[26:42.580 --> 26:44.460]  stopped, and I realized it was a real
[26:45.020 --> 26:46.520]  situation. This is no longer
[26:46.520 --> 26:48.400]  an imagination thing.
[26:48.720 --> 26:50.580]  Oh, dude.
[26:51.180 --> 26:51.820]  It's my lab.
[26:52.180 --> 26:53.560]  Great lab work, Andrew. Jesus.
[26:53.980 --> 26:56.480]  Okay, I'll test it.
[26:56.540 --> 26:57.820]  I'll cut them up, as you suggested.
[26:58.240 --> 27:00.620]  See if that makes the sleeping experience any
[27:00.620 --> 27:02.700]  better. Yeah, and try wearing
[27:02.700 --> 27:04.380]  the shocks. Do you think I have enough?
[27:04.440 --> 27:06.380]  I have ten. I'd say it covers...
[27:06.380 --> 27:08.560]  I'd say, yeah. If anything, I have too many, it feels like.
[27:08.560 --> 27:10.400]  Would you consider rafting
[27:10.400 --> 27:12.720]  them together? I feel like that ruins
[27:12.720 --> 27:14.440]  the spaghetti aspect of it.
[27:14.460 --> 27:15.360]  Yeah, that's true.
[27:16.020 --> 27:18.760]  Maybe, like, you throw a blanket over it,
[27:18.840 --> 27:19.640]  something could be done?
[27:20.480 --> 27:22.800]  Because I imagine when Geoff conceived
[27:22.800 --> 27:24.600]  sleep spaghetti, they were
[27:24.600 --> 27:26.440]  all sort of tangled up and you would sort of sleep
[27:26.440 --> 27:28.660]  in a heap of spaghetti. Yeah, like a pile
[27:28.660 --> 27:29.180]  of spaghetti.
[27:30.300 --> 27:32.460]  But you can achieve that with
[27:32.460 --> 27:34.540]  jointing the spaghetti he already
[27:34.540 --> 27:36.440]  has. Segmented.
[27:36.440 --> 27:38.580]  Yeah, as soon
[27:38.580 --> 27:40.620]  as we're done today, I'll segment this
[27:40.620 --> 27:42.640]  and figure it out.
[27:42.900 --> 27:44.460]  Andrew, I think it's phenomenal work.
[27:44.640 --> 27:46.420]  I love the shocks. I like where you're going
[27:46.420 --> 27:48.360]  with that. The idea of turning
[27:48.360 --> 27:50.140]  socks into fingerless gloves.
[27:50.740 --> 27:52.540]  I think this spaghetti is like
[27:52.540 --> 27:54.560]  we're just getting closer.
[27:55.380 --> 27:56.600]  Each experiment gets us that much
[27:56.600 --> 27:58.540]  closer. Tremendous work from
[27:58.540 --> 28:00.480]  both of you. I'm only
[28:00.480 --> 28:02.260]  saddened that I haven't been in the lab.
[28:02.960 --> 28:04.400]  Because what you guys have done has been
[28:04.400 --> 28:05.800]  really impressive and inspiring.
[28:06.200 --> 28:08.460]  And I gotta say, this might be the best turnaround
[28:08.460 --> 28:10.260]  to an episode we've ever had.
[28:10.700 --> 28:12.360]  Do you think your breakthrough on
[28:12.360 --> 28:14.440]  fruit gloves deserves an update
[28:14.440 --> 28:15.800]  or is it not ready to talk about?
[28:16.040 --> 28:18.500]  No, no, no. We'll get to that
[28:18.500 --> 28:19.960]  later. I'm not ready.
[28:20.440 --> 28:22.840]  Let me think on it some more.
[28:23.680 --> 28:24.680]  Gotta continue to innovate.
[28:25.180 --> 28:26.520]  I like that it sounds like we're both
[28:26.520 --> 28:28.380]  headed straight back to the lab though, which is good.
[28:28.440 --> 28:30.420]  Oh, we definitely are. And I feel better about
[28:30.420 --> 28:32.480]  my lab position currently than
[28:32.480 --> 28:34.520]  I think you do about yours. Mine is just
[28:34.520 --> 28:35.860]  awful dog shit.
[28:37.480 --> 28:38.520]  I also
[28:38.520 --> 28:40.580]  like that your lab has expanded
[28:40.580 --> 28:42.220]  to just your couch as well.
[28:42.560 --> 28:43.600]  I feel like
[28:44.260 --> 28:46.660]  I get heat from my lab being my desk
[28:46.660 --> 28:48.500]  a lot of the time. But you got
[28:48.500 --> 28:50.060]  a couch lab. I'm jealous.
[28:51.040 --> 28:52.200]  That's a comfortable lab.
[28:52.660 --> 28:54.660]  I guess my bed is now technically a lab
[28:54.660 --> 28:56.480]  as well. We both really
[28:56.480 --> 28:57.900]  expand in our labs.
[28:59.120 --> 29:00.320]  You think I need more noodles,
[29:00.320 --> 29:02.540]  Gavin? You think more noodles would help?
[29:02.880 --> 29:03.880]  Let me take a look at the picture again.
[29:05.240 --> 29:06.000]  Yeah, I'd say
[29:06.000 --> 29:08.520]  you could double it, probably. If they're all segmented
[29:08.520 --> 29:10.060]  and doubled, you could really
[29:10.060 --> 29:12.200]  tunnel your way in and find a really
[29:12.200 --> 29:14.260]  comfortable position. Okay, well this
[29:14.260 --> 29:15.080]  is what we're gonna do.
[29:16.320 --> 29:18.060]  I'm gonna try these shocks out.
[29:18.420 --> 29:20.480]  And if I like them as much as I think
[29:20.480 --> 29:22.220]  I will, then I could
[29:22.220 --> 29:23.820]  double it because I didn't know
[29:24.240 --> 29:26.140]  how many socks it would take to cover
[29:26.140 --> 29:28.060]  a noodle. So I bought two bags
[29:28.060 --> 29:30.180]  of socks and I only needed one.
[29:30.420 --> 29:31.660]  So I have enough
[29:31.660 --> 29:33.680]  sock material to turn them.
[29:34.100 --> 29:36.240]  So I'm kind of prepped in that
[29:36.240 --> 29:38.180]  way. We'll see. As long
[29:38.180 --> 29:40.100]  as I don't mind turning more socks in the shocks,
[29:40.180 --> 29:41.600]  like if I'll actually use them, then
[29:41.600 --> 29:43.720]  we might double it.
[29:44.140 --> 29:45.660]  Eric, just to clarify, what is our
[29:45.660 --> 29:47.500]  f*** face R&D budget currently?
[29:47.940 --> 29:49.220]  Zero. Okay.
[29:49.780 --> 29:51.100]  Yeah, I would say zero.
[29:52.360 --> 29:54.180]  I'm excited to see what else happens
[29:54.180 --> 29:55.600]  in the lab, I suppose.
[29:58.060 --> 29:59.680]  I'm curious. No,
[29:59.900 --> 30:01.640]  I take it back. I'm not curious about shocks.
[30:01.960 --> 30:03.820]  I think I got everything I needed out of shocks.
[30:05.160 --> 30:05.560]  Um...
[30:05.960 --> 30:07.920]  Yeah, it's really something. I'm proud of you, Andrew.
[30:08.380 --> 30:09.440]  Thank you. Yeah.
[30:09.760 --> 30:11.820]  Well, I can't wait. A year from now, you're gonna be
[30:11.820 --> 30:13.420]  wearing shocks yourself. I'm not.
[30:13.660 --> 30:14.940]  I won't be. No.
[30:16.360 --> 30:17.080]  Here's the thing.
[30:17.360 --> 30:19.400]  For the shoes that I wear,
[30:19.680 --> 30:21.780]  I typically wear a very low sock,
[30:21.860 --> 30:22.620]  like an ankle sock.
[30:24.540 --> 30:25.680]  Cutting the toes off that
[30:25.680 --> 30:26.100]  effectively
[30:28.040 --> 30:29.940]  destroys more than half the sock.
[30:30.440 --> 30:31.720]  Yeah. So, I don't
[30:31.720 --> 30:33.700]  really know. It's not really working for
[30:33.700 --> 30:34.500]  me, I suppose.
[30:35.460 --> 30:37.520]  They would've come in handy for the garlic, I think.
[30:37.980 --> 30:39.780]  Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah.
[30:40.160 --> 30:41.820]  Ugh. That was bad.
[30:41.920 --> 30:43.700]  I forget that we do that. That's a thought
[30:43.700 --> 30:45.500]  I have, like, every seven months.
[30:45.500 --> 30:47.740]  I'll remember that we did garlic on our
[30:47.740 --> 30:48.720]  feet. Like, ugh.
[30:49.200 --> 30:50.840]  That was wicked.
[30:51.520 --> 30:54.000]  It was a flashback to having my feet in plastic
[30:54.000 --> 30:55.600]  bags, like grocery bags.
[30:55.840 --> 30:57.880]  Yeah, and they could've been shocks the whole time.
[30:58.220 --> 31:00.000]  They could've been shocks. Well, I don't know if
[31:00.000 --> 31:01.220]  I want to put shocks through that.
[31:02.320 --> 31:03.740]  That was unpleasant.
[31:04.200 --> 31:05.220]  That was awful.
[31:05.660 --> 31:06.920]  On several levels.
[31:12.710 --> 31:13.490]  Today's episode
[31:13.490 --> 31:15.270]  is sponsored by PayPal Honey, the
[31:15.270 --> 31:17.110]  easy way to save when shopping on your iPhone
[31:17.110 --> 31:19.230]  or computer. But did you know
[31:19.230 --> 31:21.110]  it only takes a few seconds to get it?
[31:21.370 --> 31:23.310]  That means if you go to add it to your laptop
[31:23.310 --> 31:25.330]  or iPhone right now, you can be
[31:25.330 --> 31:27.370]  done before this ad read is even over.
[31:27.830 --> 31:29.330]  And it always feels great to be able to knock
[31:29.330 --> 31:31.430]  out something immediately. I mean, there's so many things
[31:31.430 --> 31:33.330]  to do in a day. Just
[31:33.330 --> 31:34.670]  being able to get something done quick.
[31:35.350 --> 31:37.270]  It's great. It's a great feeling. And you know what
[31:37.270 --> 31:39.490]  else works fast? Honey's deal-finding
[31:39.490 --> 31:41.330]  abilities. Honey is the free
[31:41.330 --> 31:43.230]  shopping tool that scours the internet for
[31:43.230 --> 31:45.250]  promo codes and applies the best one it finds
[31:45.250 --> 31:47.170]  to your cart. Now, how it works is
[31:47.170 --> 31:49.150]  imagine you're shopping on one of your favorite sites.
[31:49.330 --> 31:51.350]  When you check out, the Honey button appears
[31:51.350 --> 31:53.590]  and all you have to do is click apply coupons.
[31:53.590 --> 31:55.390]  Wait a few seconds as Honey searches
[31:55.390 --> 31:57.030]  for coupons it can find for that site.
[31:57.430 --> 31:59.330]  If Honey finds a working coupon,
[31:59.690 --> 32:01.090]  you'll watch the prices drop.
[32:01.570 --> 32:03.450]  I have used Honey and save money on
[32:03.450 --> 32:05.670]  so many things from clothing, food,
[32:05.870 --> 32:07.570]  technology. It's so easy
[32:07.570 --> 32:09.150]  to use. It's so easy to download.
[32:09.850 --> 32:11.910]  It's just a great feature to have.
[32:12.410 --> 32:13.570]  Did you know that Honey doesn't
[32:13.570 --> 32:15.710]  just work on desktops? It works on your iPhone
[32:15.710 --> 32:17.650]  too. Just activate it on Safari
[32:17.650 --> 32:19.510]  on your phone and save on the go.
[32:20.150 --> 32:21.670]  Getting Honey seriously only takes
[32:21.670 --> 32:23.590]  a few seconds. And by getting it, you'll be
[32:23.590 --> 32:25.830]  doing yourself a solid and supporting this show.

[32:33.830 --> 32:35.550]  This show is sponsored by
[32:35.550 --> 32:37.630]  BetterHelp. There are so many
[32:37.630 --> 32:39.830]  times, especially growing
[32:39.830 --> 32:42.050]  up, I felt directionless.
[32:42.410 --> 32:43.570]  Not really knowing what I
[32:43.570 --> 32:45.050]  wanted to do with my future.
[32:45.550 --> 32:46.170]  The fear.
[32:47.630 --> 32:49.530]  It sucks. It's not a fun time.
[32:49.530 --> 32:51.410]  Even now, it's so easy to
[32:51.410 --> 32:52.990]  second guess what your direction is.
[32:53.750 --> 32:55.490]  I found just trying
[32:55.490 --> 32:57.450]  stuff and doing new experiences
[32:57.450 --> 32:59.550]  and just learning from those to be super helpful.
[32:59.910 --> 33:01.390]  But sometimes
[33:01.390 --> 33:03.450]  it's great to talk to someone about those
[33:03.450 --> 33:05.390]  kinds of issues. And whether
[33:05.390 --> 33:07.150]  you're dealing with decisions around your career,
[33:07.310 --> 33:09.470]  relationships, or anything else, you can move
[33:09.470 --> 33:11.090]  forward with confidence and excitement
[33:12.630 --> 33:13.570]  through therapy
[33:13.570 --> 33:15.410]  or other methods. I know therapy
[33:15.410 --> 33:17.710]  is something for me that has been super
[33:17.710 --> 33:19.830]  beneficial. It
[33:19.830 --> 33:21.870]  has helped me in not
[33:21.870 --> 33:23.770]  just understanding some of my
[33:23.770 --> 33:25.670]  past trauma or anxiety issues,
[33:25.750 --> 33:28.050]  but approaching
[33:28.050 --> 33:29.650]  them in a way that I don't think I ever would have
[33:29.650 --> 33:31.830]  naturally come to by myself. So I would highly
[33:31.830 --> 33:33.730]  recommend that experience
[33:33.730 --> 33:35.250]  and that process to anyone.
[33:36.210 --> 33:37.910]  If you're thinking of starting therapy,
[33:38.050 --> 33:38.950]  give BetterHelp a try.

[33:42.110 --> 33:43.810]  flexible, and suited to your schedule.
[33:44.090 --> 33:45.950]  All you have to do is fill out a brief questionnaire,
[33:45.950 --> 33:47.810]  get matched with a licensed therapist,
[33:48.270 --> 33:50.250]  and you have the ability to switch therapists
[33:50.250 --> 33:52.070]  any time for no additional charge.

[34:05.610 --> 34:06.650]  We have...
[34:06.650 --> 34:07.970]  I know we want to get to Vegas
[34:07.970 --> 34:10.110]  and everything. Can we talk
[34:10.110 --> 34:12.230]  about the break show real quick, Geoff?
[34:12.370 --> 34:14.010]  Are we fine
[34:14.010 --> 34:15.370]  to talk about that?
[34:16.090 --> 34:17.190]  Yeah, dude. Do it.
[34:18.770 --> 34:19.810]  Mondays, 4pm Central
[34:19.810 --> 34:21.850]  Time on RT and the F*** Face YouTube.
[34:22.150 --> 34:23.710]  We're live. We're doing the break show.
[34:23.910 --> 34:25.850]  It's weekly, every Monday. If there's a Monday
[34:25.850 --> 34:27.930]  where we're off, we're not pre-recording it. We just won't
[34:27.930 --> 34:29.670]  do one that week. And then the VOD,
[34:30.110 --> 34:31.910]  so if you want to watch it later, it'll be up on
[34:31.910 --> 34:33.770]  Thursday on Rooster Teeth first, and then Friday
[34:33.770 --> 34:35.810]  for the... on the F*** Face YouTube channel.
[34:36.170 --> 34:37.950]  So, there you go. I figure if we put
[34:37.950 --> 34:39.690]  it in the middle of the episode, it's more effective than
[34:39.690 --> 34:41.490]  the very, very end. You know what I mean?
[34:41.490 --> 34:42.810]  And we're starting in August, right?
[34:43.050 --> 34:45.490]  August 7th, so it'll be the first...
[34:46.090 --> 34:47.570]  I think, what? That's next week when this one
[34:47.570 --> 34:48.430]  comes out, so...
[34:48.430 --> 34:50.310]  Very soon.
[34:50.630 --> 34:53.450]  And when you say... and I'd like to re-emphasize
[34:53.450 --> 34:55.490]  the point, the majority of Mondays...
[34:56.070 --> 34:57.710]  Yeah. Yes. Absolutely.
[34:58.110 --> 34:59.110]  Certainly not every Monday.
[34:59.530 --> 35:00.650]  But most Mondays.
[35:01.070 --> 35:03.110]  Gavin and Andrew, you guys are also welcome
[35:03.110 --> 35:05.530]  to be on it when you have time.
[35:06.270 --> 35:07.690]  The invitation's always there.
[35:09.190 --> 35:09.630]  Geoff,
[35:09.630 --> 35:11.450]  myself, and Emily are gonna be opening
[35:11.450 --> 35:13.390]  cards, and then maybe Gus will be there sometimes.
[35:13.550 --> 35:14.830]  Remember Gus? Remember him?
[35:15.290 --> 35:16.170]  He might be there sometimes.
[35:17.630 --> 35:19.370]  Jack'll invite himself on, for sure.
[35:19.750 --> 35:21.390]  No, he's busy. So...
[35:21.970 --> 35:23.570]  So, you know, we'll be...
[35:23.570 --> 35:25.350]  It'll be fun. Every Monday,
[35:25.490 --> 35:27.150]  4pm Central. So, there you go.
[35:27.630 --> 35:29.430]  Did you ever collect Gus's cards
[35:29.950 --> 35:31.150]  from... We have Gus's cards.
[35:31.230 --> 35:32.690]  He wants to open them. We're gonna do that.
[35:32.970 --> 35:34.530]  He's desperate to get rid of them, so we'll...
[35:34.530 --> 35:35.950]  He wants them gone so badly.
[35:35.950 --> 35:37.930]  Did you brand
[35:37.930 --> 35:38.670]  the Shocks?
[35:39.270 --> 35:41.210]  Not me. Nick did.
[35:42.290 --> 35:42.930]  Oh!
[35:43.650 --> 35:44.990]  I like it!
[35:45.590 --> 35:46.850]  Oh, dude.
[35:48.250 --> 35:49.890]  I wonder how that'd look
[35:49.890 --> 35:50.410]  on a foot.
[35:51.310 --> 35:52.450]  I don't wanna know.
[35:52.990 --> 35:55.830]  I talked to Tony because
[35:55.830 --> 35:57.730]  I had to send him your knives
[35:57.730 --> 35:59.270]  or... Oh, the forks. What were they?
[35:59.670 --> 36:00.910]  The forks. Forkspression.
[36:02.110 --> 36:03.470]  Forkspression. Fun forks.
[36:03.470 --> 36:04.930]  Yeah, I had a...
[36:04.930 --> 36:06.610]  I had a merch meeting and
[36:07.010 --> 36:09.110]  Tony was like, what about this thing? And I said, you gotta ask.
[36:09.170 --> 36:11.290]  I don't know. I don't know what to say about
[36:12.070 --> 36:13.490]  those. Oh! So, yeah.
[36:13.730 --> 36:15.350]  I just thought of a slogan for them.
[36:15.610 --> 36:17.730]  Oh, what's the slogan? Forkspressions.
[36:17.930 --> 36:18.810]  Eat your feelings.
[36:19.450 --> 36:21.370]  Wow! I don't... You couldn't use those.
[36:21.370 --> 36:22.810]  I like that. There's just no way.
[36:23.190 --> 36:24.650]  No, you definitely could. Uh-huh. Yeah!
[36:25.590 --> 36:27.430]  I could send them to Gavin and he'll try them
[36:27.430 --> 36:29.510]  because he's already poisoned, so it can't get worse.
[36:29.830 --> 36:30.970]  That's true. Gavin, are you still alive?
[36:30.970 --> 36:32.750]  Yeah, I'm still here. Yeah, I'm good.
[36:34.190 --> 36:34.910]  Hey, Andrew?
[36:35.430 --> 36:37.110]  Yes? Just so we're on
[36:37.110 --> 36:38.250]  the same page, you're human.
[36:38.930 --> 36:41.070]  Yeah. Okay. Alright. You heard it.
[36:41.130 --> 36:42.790]  Why? Fair enough. No, no reason.
[36:43.770 --> 36:44.770]  Hey, I had an idea.
[36:45.710 --> 36:47.010]  I had an idea for a new
[36:47.010 --> 36:48.750]  draft I wanted to run by you guys.
[36:49.230 --> 36:50.850]  Okay. I don't want to, like,
[36:51.190 --> 36:53.130]  beat the drafts to death, but I kind of also
[36:53.130 --> 36:54.850]  want to keep doing them forever. Yeah.
[36:55.850 --> 36:57.230]  I don't know how feasible
[36:57.230 --> 36:58.830]  this one is to, like, to
[36:59.310 --> 36:59.710]  release.
[37:00.550 --> 37:02.630]  So it may be an idea that you guys say,
[37:02.830 --> 37:04.670]  hey, it's a cool idea, but we'll never do it because it
[37:04.670 --> 37:06.850]  would be hard to make. But wouldn't it be
[37:06.850 --> 37:08.930]  fun to do a funniest
[37:08.930 --> 37:10.650]  moments in film draft?
[37:11.570 --> 37:11.970]  Yes.
[37:12.470 --> 37:14.310]  Like, you pick the four funniest moments
[37:14.770 --> 37:16.730]  in film to you, and then we all present them.
[37:16.910 --> 37:18.550]  Because, Andrew, you were just talking about how
[37:18.550 --> 37:20.950]  you saw Dirty Work recently, and you and I
[37:20.950 --> 37:22.590]  were talking back and forth about
[37:22.590 --> 37:24.370]  our favorite moments from Dirty Work.
[37:24.510 --> 37:26.810]  And there's a moment that Gavin and I always reference that I
[37:26.810 --> 37:28.770]  think is one of the four funniest moments in the
[37:28.770 --> 37:30.710]  history of film. And that
[37:30.710 --> 37:32.830]  got me thinking about all my other favorite moments, and it'd be fun
[37:32.830 --> 37:33.930]  to share that in some way.
[37:35.010 --> 37:36.790]  I like that. We have the
[37:36.790 --> 37:38.450]  summer of 98 ranking
[37:38.450 --> 37:40.990]  coming out. Maybe that even could be a better format
[37:41.510 --> 37:42.950]  for... maybe it's not even a draft.
[37:43.070 --> 37:45.010]  Maybe it's, like, a debate.
[37:45.130 --> 37:46.070]  A consensus ranking.
[37:46.630 --> 37:48.250]  Potentially. Because the film will be aligned.
[37:48.730 --> 37:50.830]  Out of curiosity, how many of the 98 movies have
[37:50.830 --> 37:52.790]  you guys seen? Like, I know Gavin's seen
[37:52.790 --> 37:54.810]  ten. I've seen ten from your list.
[37:54.810 --> 37:56.050]  Yeah. Also,
[37:56.770 --> 37:58.610]  I haven't talked to TPG about this.
[37:58.870 --> 38:00.950]  He asked me about how the summer of 98
[38:00.950 --> 38:02.850]  movie stuff was going. I sent him...
[38:02.850 --> 38:04.610]  I ranked all of them, just personally.
[38:04.990 --> 38:06.110]  1 through 32
[38:06.770 --> 38:08.930]  of what I think the most summer of 98 film
[38:08.930 --> 38:11.190]  is in the least. And he sent me an audio
[38:11.190 --> 38:13.070]  clip of him reacting
[38:13.070 --> 38:14.530]  to my rankings and giving
[38:14.530 --> 38:16.570]  analysis on every
[38:16.570 --> 38:18.530]  pic. We should throw that into the
[38:18.530 --> 38:21.010]  end of our draft.
[38:21.430 --> 38:22.770]  Or something. It should definitely go somewhere.
[38:22.770 --> 38:24.750]  It's great. His analysis
[38:24.750 --> 38:25.710]  is fantastic.
[38:26.850 --> 38:28.670]  I'm counting. Hold on.
[38:28.850 --> 38:31.210]  You know, I think I have to put Basketball at number one.
[38:32.210 --> 38:33.010]  We'll see.
[38:33.350 --> 38:34.270]  We'll see about that.
[38:35.190 --> 38:36.330]  I think it could get contentious.
[38:37.030 --> 38:37.890]  Is Nick a movie guy?
[38:38.270 --> 38:40.910]  I don't know if Nick's a movie guy or not. Nick, are you a movie guy?
[38:42.130 --> 38:42.750]  He's just muted.
[38:43.010 --> 38:43.830]  Are you wearing a mask?
[38:43.990 --> 38:47.070]  He was unmuted the whole time and then muted himself
[38:47.070 --> 38:47.550]  to talk.
[38:47.930 --> 38:50.570]  Because, like, every audio engineer
[38:50.570 --> 38:52.450]  here at this company, it's
[38:52.450 --> 38:54.530]  backwards. And his audio is
[38:54.530 --> 38:54.930]  the worst.
[38:55.210 --> 38:58.610]  You spoke to him the second he got up to take a
[38:58.610 --> 38:59.570]  piss, is what it sounds like.
[39:01.350 --> 39:02.830]  Eric, do you know if Nick's a movie guy?
[39:03.190 --> 39:04.510]  I don't. I'm not
[39:04.510 --> 39:04.970]  sure.
[39:06.750 --> 39:08.690]  I would imagine he is. He's a radio
[39:08.690 --> 39:10.530]  guy, so I would imagine he's a movie guy.
[39:11.170 --> 39:11.850]  I bet he is, too.
[39:12.150 --> 39:14.570]  I would think so. I've seen 24
[39:14.570 --> 39:16.310]  of these films. You've seen 24?
[39:16.910 --> 39:17.210]  Wow.
[39:18.130 --> 39:19.710]  That's so many of them.
[39:20.250 --> 39:21.370]  Yeah, that's a lot of them.
[39:21.610 --> 39:23.390]  I'd have to do a count, but instead
[39:23.390 --> 39:25.350]  of waiting for me, Geoff should start talking
[39:25.350 --> 39:27.390]  about Vegas. God, do you think there's enough time
[39:27.390 --> 39:28.210]  left to talk about Vegas?
[39:28.670 --> 39:31.170]  I mean, we have another one, and also, yes,
[39:31.410 --> 39:33.390]  because it's, what, 40
[39:33.390 --> 39:35.530]  minutes right now? 35 minutes?
[39:36.230 --> 39:36.490]  Okay.
[39:37.690 --> 39:38.130]  So,
[39:39.150 --> 39:40.030]  last weekend,
[39:40.950 --> 39:42.990]  for the wedding, my
[39:42.990 --> 39:45.290]  soon-to-be father-in-law and soon-to-be
[39:45.290 --> 39:47.390]  brother-in-law invited me out to Las
[39:47.390 --> 39:49.170]  Vegas to watch NBA
[39:49.170 --> 39:51.270]  Summer League games as kind of like
[39:51.270 --> 39:53.390]  a bachelor's weekend kind of thing, you know?
[39:54.330 --> 39:55.050]  And, uh,
[39:55.130 --> 39:57.290]  I thought that was very sweet and kind of them, and
[39:57.290 --> 39:59.250]  we all kind of, like, bond over sports,
[39:59.350 --> 40:01.250]  and I am a huge NBA fan, obviously,
[40:01.430 --> 40:03.350]  and I've been to the Summer League once before and had the time
[40:03.350 --> 40:05.250]  of my life, and really wanted to relive that
[40:05.250 --> 40:07.350]  experience, and I also, the first time I did it,
[40:07.390 --> 40:09.330]  I did it completely by myself, so the idea of
[40:09.330 --> 40:10.530]  doing it with friends was cool, too.
[40:11.350 --> 40:12.730]  Uh, and so,
[40:12.730 --> 40:14.410]  I flew out Friday
[40:15.910 --> 40:16.630]  and got
[40:16.630 --> 40:18.810]  there, checked into my hotel, we were
[40:18.810 --> 40:20.950]  staying at the Wynn, and
[40:20.950 --> 40:22.870]  met up with my father-in-law
[40:22.870 --> 40:24.390]  and brother-in-law-
[40:24.810 --> 40:26.490]  I'll just call him father-in-law and brother-in-law, it'll be
[40:26.490 --> 40:29.010]  just around the corner, anyway. And, uh,
[40:30.170 --> 40:30.810]  hung out with
[40:30.810 --> 40:32.290]  him in the sports book and did a little
[40:32.290 --> 40:34.430]  bet on some horses, came out about even,
[40:34.930 --> 40:36.150]  and then went to, they
[40:36.570 --> 40:38.750]  invited me out to dinner at this Jose Andres restaurant
[40:38.750 --> 40:40.750]  called Bizarre Meats that we always eat at when we go to
[40:40.750 --> 40:43.070]  Vegas. Uh, my father-in-law
[40:43.070 --> 40:44.690]  is a huge, like, Jose
[40:44.690 --> 40:46.590]  Andres fan. Um, a lot of
[40:46.590 --> 40:48.830]  his charitable work and his food and stuff, and so I kind
[40:48.830 --> 40:50.710]  of thought it'd be cool for him to go to this restaurant
[40:50.710 --> 40:52.870]  because he'd never been before. And so
[40:52.870 --> 40:54.690]  they made a reservation, and
[40:54.690 --> 40:56.650]  we walked around a corner
[40:56.650 --> 40:58.750]  to a table that was
[40:58.750 --> 41:00.750]  full of people that I knew. And I was
[41:00.750 --> 41:02.910]  not expecting that. A real-life
[41:02.910 --> 41:04.270]  blindside, you might say.
[41:04.610 --> 41:06.910]  An incredible blindside.
[41:07.590 --> 41:08.910]  Uh, sitting around that table
[41:08.910 --> 41:10.910]  were my favorite people in
[41:10.910 --> 41:12.610]  the world that were boys. Um,
[41:12.790 --> 41:14.450]  my cousin Christopher, and Gavin,
[41:15.110 --> 41:16.770]  and Jack, and
[41:16.770 --> 41:18.970]  uh, that was it. We were planning it, and
[41:18.970 --> 41:20.930]  uh... Come on!
[41:21.470 --> 41:21.830]  Eric!
[41:24.270 --> 41:24.950]  We were planning
[41:24.950 --> 41:26.850]  it, and Kent was like, yeah, yeah, we
[41:26.850 --> 41:28.950]  should surprise him, uh, get to the
[41:28.950 --> 41:30.670]  meal before him and all that. And then we realized that we couldn't
[41:30.670 --> 41:32.890]  fly any time near
[41:32.890 --> 41:35.130]  when you were flying, because we were all coming from the same place.
[41:35.490 --> 41:37.010]  So we had to get an earlier flight.
[41:37.010 --> 41:39.010]  You were flying, what time did you fly, like 2 something?
[41:39.350 --> 41:40.930]  I flew out at like 2.30,
[41:41.050 --> 41:43.050]  I think, yeah. Yeah, we, uh, our flight took
[41:43.050 --> 41:43.850]  off at 8am.
[41:44.630 --> 41:47.050]  Mine was at 9. We all thought
[41:47.050 --> 41:49.070]  there's no way that we can fly around
[41:49.070 --> 41:50.570]  the same time Geoff is.
[41:50.830 --> 41:52.550]  Anyway, that's what most of us thought.
[41:53.230 --> 41:55.050]  You know what's funny about that too? I got to
[41:55.050 --> 41:57.110]  the airport a little early, uh,
[41:57.110 --> 41:58.410]  because I was bored, and so I
[41:58.890 --> 42:01.070]  tried to see how fast I could walk from the
[42:01.070 --> 42:02.970]  first terminal to the last terminal and back.
[42:03.230 --> 42:05.050]  So I absolutely, and I timed it,
[42:05.050 --> 42:06.830]  I absolutely would have run into
[42:06.830 --> 42:08.190]  anybody that was in that airport.
[42:08.570 --> 42:11.350]  How fast could you do it? It took me about 9 minutes
[42:11.350 --> 42:12.870]  to run into the other and back.
[42:13.090 --> 42:14.630]  Or, one into the other and then 9 minutes to go back.
[42:15.030 --> 42:17.110]  Yeah, we, uh, I woke up at 5am, and then
[42:17.110 --> 42:18.690]  we had, once we got to Vegas,
[42:18.890 --> 42:20.950]  we had 11 hours to kill.
[42:21.270 --> 42:22.090]  Ha ha ha!
[42:24.190 --> 42:24.990]  So what did
[42:24.990 --> 42:26.310]  you guys do for 11 hours?
[42:26.970 --> 42:29.010]  Uh, we had
[42:29.010 --> 42:30.730]  some mogs, um,
[42:31.610 --> 42:33.190]  we played roulette,
[42:33.190 --> 42:35.330]  and then we went
[42:35.330 --> 42:37.230]  to the pool. Can we
[42:37.230 --> 42:38.630]  talk about the roulette thing?
[42:39.250 --> 42:41.190]  What happened with roulette? Gavin
[42:41.190 --> 42:43.450]  told me earlier in the week
[42:43.450 --> 42:45.090]  that he has, like, a streak
[42:45.090 --> 42:47.190]  going in Vegas, where
[42:47.190 --> 42:49.250]  he only plays, was it, you only play
[42:49.250 --> 42:50.710]  like roulette, like one game?
[42:51.190 --> 42:53.110]  Yeah, I try and walk into a casino
[42:53.110 --> 42:55.250]  on my trip to Vegas, I put down $100
[42:55.250 --> 42:57.130]  on one color, and
[42:57.130 --> 42:58.630]  the last 4 trips to Vegas,
[42:59.150 --> 43:01.190]  I've won, and then I just
[43:01.190 --> 43:02.830]  take the $200 and I don't
[43:02.830 --> 43:03.530]  gamble again.
[43:05.210 --> 43:07.410]  So that's what he said
[43:07.410 --> 43:08.870]  in this text,
[43:09.550 --> 43:10.390]  and he's, uh,
[43:10.730 --> 43:12.930]  we were like, oh, he's put it on black or whatever,
[43:12.930 --> 43:14.890]  and I just said, like, I don't know, who can
[43:14.890 --> 43:15.830]  think about red?
[43:16.470 --> 43:18.570]  Yeah, I was flying to Vegas, I was texting Eric
[43:18.570 --> 43:20.790]  leading up to this trip, I was like, yeah, you know, I'm thinking
[43:20.790 --> 43:22.870]  it's black, it's gonna be black.
[43:23.850 --> 43:24.910]  Eric convinced me that red
[43:24.910 --> 43:25.850]  might be an option.
[43:26.270 --> 43:28.610]  All I said was, who bets on red?
[43:28.610 --> 43:29.770]  Red might be an option.
[43:30.570 --> 43:32.390]  He's playing this, like, I
[43:32.390 --> 43:34.210]  twisted his arm to do red.
[43:35.210 --> 43:36.170]  Not what happened.
[43:36.390 --> 43:38.850]  I simply inceptioned the idea
[43:38.850 --> 43:39.530]  into him.
[43:40.530 --> 43:42.130]  And then I thought it'd be- oh.
[43:42.590 --> 43:43.230]  That's just time.
[43:43.630 --> 43:45.130]  Thanks, man.
[43:46.250 --> 43:48.470]  Then I thought it'd be cool if, like, I put it
[43:48.470 --> 43:50.610]  to Eric and Jack, like, maybe you wanna bet
[43:50.610 --> 43:52.390]  with me, maybe you wanna bet against me,
[43:52.590 --> 43:54.130]  maybe get in on the same,
[43:54.290 --> 43:55.890]  yeah, get in on the same spin.
[43:56.310 --> 43:57.850]  So, Gavin lays
[43:57.850 --> 44:00.050]  down his- there's no one else at this roulette
[44:00.630 --> 44:01.910]  table. There's one other one
[44:01.910 --> 44:03.610]  and it's hopping. This one's empty.
[44:03.890 --> 44:05.870]  At the win. And, uh,
[44:06.150 --> 44:07.890]  Gavin walks over and we're trying to-
[44:07.890 --> 44:09.670]  oh, is it the time? Okay, yeah, okay, we're gonna do it.
[44:09.750 --> 44:11.090]  What color are you gonna go with? Whatever.
[44:12.210 --> 44:13.690]  Jack is like, I'm in for 60.
[44:13.750 --> 44:15.630]  I'm like, I'll put 40 in. You know, whatever.
[44:16.110 --> 44:17.810]  Let's see what happens. And
[44:18.290 --> 44:19.310]  Gavin picks red.
[44:19.990 --> 44:21.310]  So Jack picks red.
[44:21.830 --> 44:23.010]  And then I pick black.
[44:23.010 --> 44:24.910]  Oh, Aaron
[44:24.910 --> 44:26.870]  picking what he- what he twisted
[44:26.870 --> 44:29.050]  my arm away from. Yeah, twisted his arm.
[44:29.390 --> 44:31.010]  If Jack- if Jack would've
[44:31.010 --> 44:32.990]  picked black, I would've picked red.
[44:33.210 --> 44:35.010]  We just needed to do opposites so
[44:35.010 --> 44:37.070]  that way it paid out. And the
[44:37.070 --> 44:39.030]  dealer or whatever at the roulette
[44:39.030 --> 44:41.110]  table was like, oh good, now there's like some action
[44:41.110 --> 44:42.930]  like, you know, something's gonna happen.
[44:43.090 --> 44:45.230]  Ah. He spins
[44:45.230 --> 44:46.210]  the roulette wheel,
[44:46.990 --> 44:48.830]  spins the ball into it, it
[44:48.830 --> 44:51.050]  goes, and it hits
[44:51.050 --> 44:53.090]  double zero green, and we lost
[44:53.090 --> 44:53.790]  all of our money.
[44:55.430 --> 44:56.590]  Are you serious?
[44:56.810 --> 44:59.170]  We all just burst out
[44:59.170 --> 45:00.930]  laughing. I almost fell on the floor.
[45:01.450 --> 45:03.030]  And then we all
[45:03.030 --> 45:05.150]  just walked away from the roulette
[45:05.150 --> 45:06.910]  table having, between us, lost
[45:06.910 --> 45:08.870]  $200. And
[45:08.870 --> 45:11.090]  it might be the best- it might be the
[45:11.090 --> 45:12.830]  best loss of money of my life.
[45:12.910 --> 45:14.950]  It was so well spent. It was so funny.
[45:15.390 --> 45:16.970]  And we just couldn't believe it.
[45:17.390 --> 45:18.910]  Um, the roulette dealer
[45:18.910 --> 45:21.030]  was even shocked. He just had his mouth agape
[45:21.030 --> 45:22.410]  and he just went, I don't-
[45:22.410 --> 45:24.150]  I don't under- I don't know.
[45:25.010 --> 45:25.870]  That was it.
[45:27.210 --> 45:29.130]  Andrew, later that day
[45:29.130 --> 45:30.830]  after we finished dinner,
[45:31.030 --> 45:32.790]  we go, and there's
[45:32.790 --> 45:34.990]  roulette tables and craps. Jack is-
[45:34.990 --> 45:36.730]  you talk about twisting arms. Jack wants
[45:36.730 --> 45:38.350]  everyone to play fucking craps.
[45:38.710 --> 45:40.850]  Oh my god, dude. Jack has a problem.
[45:41.170 --> 45:42.490]  Jack's a craps guy.
[45:42.770 --> 45:44.670]  Yeah, Jesus Christ. He taught me how
[45:44.670 --> 45:46.770]  craps work. Yeah. We finally
[45:46.770 --> 45:48.850]  learned how craps works later in the trip.
[45:49.130 --> 45:50.790]  But, uh, he taught us
[45:50.790 --> 45:53.030]  some stuff. There's a roulette
[45:53.030 --> 45:55.130]  table, Andrew, and no one's at it.
[45:56.190 --> 45:56.930]  Gavin goes-
[45:56.930 --> 45:58.750]  I get weird when it's- when there's like a
[45:58.750 --> 46:00.630]  shitload of other people. Like, I don't really-
[46:00.630 --> 46:02.710]  I don't wanna mess it up, but I wanna like
[46:02.710 --> 46:04.890]  get in people's way. So I just wait until there's
[46:04.890 --> 46:06.770]  just literally no one at a roulette table.
[46:07.030 --> 46:08.070]  So Gavin went over.
[46:08.810 --> 46:09.810]  Another hundred bucks.
[46:10.890 --> 46:11.730]  On red.
[46:13.310 --> 46:14.150]  It spins.
[46:14.890 --> 46:15.410]  No.
[46:16.170 --> 46:18.230]  Well, first, you gotta say that, um, because
[46:18.230 --> 46:19.690]  now the group was bigger.
[46:20.070 --> 46:22.270]  So now, Geoff's father-in-law
[46:22.270 --> 46:24.290]  wants to get in on this action.
[46:24.530 --> 46:26.070]  He bets against me.
[46:26.350 --> 46:27.270]  He goes on black.
[46:27.870 --> 46:29.470]  So now there's some action, Andrew.
[46:30.930 --> 46:32.150]  No. It spins.
[46:33.150 --> 46:33.810]  No. Green.
[46:34.710 --> 46:35.230]  No!
[46:35.950 --> 46:37.650]  Again. Yep. No!
[46:38.250 --> 46:40.150]  I got danned. This is what happened to
[46:40.150 --> 46:41.890]  Dan when he was- my luck
[46:41.890 --> 46:44.190]  has run out. I've got Dan luck
[46:44.190 --> 46:46.030]  now. I think Dan has the luck.
[46:47.030 --> 46:48.110]  Gavin walked around
[46:48.110 --> 46:49.890]  in a daze all weekend.
[46:50.250 --> 46:51.290]  At one point,
[46:51.770 --> 46:54.010]  we walked by, we saw a place that was playing- where they were playing
[46:54.010 --> 46:55.670]  War. You know that game where it's just like
[46:55.670 --> 46:57.930]  high or low? And I- as a joke, I
[46:57.930 --> 46:59.890]  sat down, and it was
[46:59.890 --> 47:01.190]  like 25 bucks a hand.
[47:01.570 --> 47:03.870]  And so I just sat down and just played
[47:04.370 --> 47:06.030]  and with like- I put- I don't know.
[47:06.050 --> 47:07.690]  I played like five times and I came out even.
[47:07.750 --> 47:09.970]  And I was like, oh, that was pretty fun. That was actually more fun than I
[47:09.970 --> 47:11.970]  thought it would be. I go, Gavin, you should try it.
[47:12.010 --> 47:13.870]  And he goes, no, my luck is- I've lost my luck.
[47:13.990 --> 47:15.970]  It's terrible. And I go- he goes, I don't want to blow any more money.
[47:16.030 --> 47:17.090]  And I go, here's $100.
[47:17.670 --> 47:19.890]  Just sit down and play it. You're gonna have
[47:19.890 --> 47:21.630]  fun. You can't lose. It's 50-50.
[47:22.050 --> 47:23.990]  I swear to God. It goes, hand one
[47:23.990 --> 47:25.710]  gives you $25. Hand two
[47:25.710 --> 47:27.890]  gives you $25. Pull three gives you $25.
[47:28.110 --> 47:29.810]  Pull four gives $25. $100
[47:29.810 --> 47:31.610]  gone that fast.
[47:31.770 --> 47:33.490]  And he just got up. It was about 45 seconds.
[47:33.710 --> 47:35.770]  And also, it was like- the numbers were-
[47:35.770 --> 47:37.690]  it was like- my first card was a five.
[47:37.690 --> 47:39.390]  And then it was like, dealer seven.
[47:39.550 --> 47:41.670]  And then my number kept getting higher. Then I was like
[47:41.670 --> 47:43.250]  on a nine. It was like, oh, it was a jack.
[47:43.430 --> 47:45.490]  Then I got a queen. And the dealer has a king.
[47:45.570 --> 47:47.830]  It's like, I felt like I was gonna get there.
[47:48.050 --> 47:49.730]  And it just didn't work out for me.
[47:50.130 --> 47:51.690]  I pissed away that hundred.
[47:52.350 --> 47:54.190]  It was faster-
[47:54.190 --> 47:56.010]  he lost $100 faster
[47:56.010 --> 47:58.030]  at war than he did at roulette
[47:58.030 --> 47:59.170]  twice. Easily.
[47:59.410 --> 48:01.910]  I lost four times at war in the time
[48:01.910 --> 48:03.730]  it would have taken the ball to land at a color.
[48:03.730 --> 48:04.390]  Uh,
[48:06.950 --> 48:07.770]  Gavin's luck
[48:07.770 --> 48:09.870]  was so bad that when he tried to get
[48:09.870 --> 48:11.690]  more money out of the ATM
[48:12.550 --> 48:13.690]  it would not
[48:13.690 --> 48:15.350]  do it. And he tried
[48:15.350 --> 48:17.750]  seven times. That's why I had to give him
[48:17.750 --> 48:19.450]  $100 to encourage him to play.
[48:19.650 --> 48:21.710]  Well, I hit my withdrawal limit from my
[48:21.710 --> 48:23.750]  bank, which is apparently $400.
[48:24.450 --> 48:25.490]  And I think, honestly,
[48:25.690 --> 48:27.070]  I think that was for the best.
[48:27.250 --> 48:29.810]  It kept me from starting a losing
[48:29.810 --> 48:31.870]  streak that would have gone out of
[48:31.870 --> 48:33.770]  hand. Now you know
[48:33.770 --> 48:35.270]  why they have those withdrawal limits.
[48:36.430 --> 48:37.950]  Anyway, when no one was watching
[48:37.950 --> 48:39.830]  I went over to roulette and I put it on red
[48:39.830 --> 48:41.310]  and I hit. Great.
[48:41.770 --> 48:43.710]  Yeah. I watched
[48:43.710 --> 48:45.570]  Eric sneak away from everyone
[48:45.570 --> 48:47.710]  watching Jack play craps and I
[48:47.710 --> 48:49.710]  just found him on a roulette table just with a
[48:49.710 --> 48:50.390]  pile of chips.
[48:51.870 --> 48:52.410]  I made like $100.
[48:53.510 --> 48:55.770]  So I didn't see it. All I got
[48:55.770 --> 48:57.710]  to witness was Gavin's gambling failure.
[48:57.850 --> 48:59.650]  But you guys did tell me that Gavin at least
[48:59.650 --> 49:01.590]  had one very cool, smooth
[49:01.590 --> 49:03.010]  moment. Oh!
[49:03.450 --> 49:05.670]  Oh my God. If we
[49:05.670 --> 49:07.570]  were in our 20s, if we were younger
[49:07.570 --> 49:09.530]  men and this happened, it would have been
[49:09.530 --> 49:11.610]  like we would have waited until like the
[49:11.610 --> 49:13.570]  waitress walked away to congratulate Gavin.
[49:13.730 --> 49:15.350]  But we were at the pool.
[49:16.510 --> 49:17.750]  We were waiting for you guys.
[49:17.810 --> 49:19.550]  You're in the sun. It was nice. The waitress comes
[49:19.550 --> 49:21.490]  over and she goes, Oh, do you guys want a drink?
[49:21.770 --> 49:22.870]  So we ordered drinks.
[49:23.730 --> 49:25.410]  And she's like, Oh, do you want to charge them to the rooms?
[49:25.530 --> 49:26.410]  I said, Yep. And so
[49:27.290 --> 49:28.410]  Jack gives his room
[49:28.410 --> 49:30.530]  number and his last name. I give my room number and my last
[49:30.530 --> 49:32.230]  name and she goes, Oh, yours? And
[49:32.230 --> 49:34.190]  Gavin goes, Oh, you know
[49:35.170 --> 49:36.050]  $21.20
[49:36.910 --> 49:38.370]  free. And she goes,
[49:38.610 --> 49:39.470]  You have an accent.
[49:41.790 --> 49:42.550]  Not even
[49:42.550 --> 49:43.490]  you're British.
[49:44.270 --> 49:46.330]  You have an accent. She is
[49:46.330 --> 49:48.010]  maybe 20. I think.
[49:48.290 --> 49:49.550]  Maybe. And
[49:50.430 --> 49:52.550]  Gavin went, Yep. Absolutely.
[49:52.830 --> 49:54.310]  And then she went, Oh, I'm sorry. What was your
[49:54.310 --> 49:56.270]  last name? And he went, Free. F-R-E-E.
[49:57.090 --> 49:57.570]  Oh.
[49:57.990 --> 50:00.090]  You get anything free
[50:00.090 --> 50:02.230]  with that name? And he just
[50:02.230 --> 50:03.610]  went, Maybe this drink.
[50:05.470 --> 50:05.950]  Silence.
[50:06.550 --> 50:08.250]  And then me and Jack going,
[50:08.770 --> 50:10.150]  Oh, damn, man.
[50:10.570 --> 50:12.090]  We use that one all the time.
[50:12.170 --> 50:13.950]  Holy shit. Way to go.
[50:14.450 --> 50:15.850]  She gave a great grin.
[50:15.990 --> 50:18.270]  And then we just started celebrating
[50:18.270 --> 50:20.130]  the smoothness of the line
[50:20.130 --> 50:22.030]  before she left. And it was like,
[50:22.030 --> 50:23.390]  Oh, we're just a bunch of old nerds.
[50:23.390 --> 50:25.610]  Oh, the dorky shit. And Gavin went,
[50:25.850 --> 50:27.650]  I've never said that before in my life.
[50:28.870 --> 50:30.130]  Well, I think it was
[50:30.130 --> 50:31.890]  smooth because I said it with
[50:31.890 --> 50:33.890]  no hesitation. Like it just came out
[50:33.890 --> 50:35.490]  like I said it a thousand times.
[50:36.450 --> 50:37.690]  It didn't work either.
[50:37.770 --> 50:39.410]  It was a $28 drink.
[50:39.690 --> 50:41.670]  Oh, God. But yeah, I think I
[50:41.670 --> 50:43.610]  walked away from that thinking, Wow, maybe
[50:43.610 --> 50:44.810]  I've got game now.
[50:46.170 --> 50:47.730]  How was the drink, though? Was it good?
[50:48.310 --> 50:48.510]  Yeah.
[50:48.510 --> 50:50.550]  Got a Miami Vice.
[50:51.190 --> 50:52.250]  Yeah, I didn't know what that was.
[50:52.950 --> 50:54.630]  Eric introduced me
[50:54.630 --> 50:56.490]  to a lot of stuff. Yeah, all weekend
[50:56.490 --> 50:58.390]  it was everything I ordered. Gavin went,
[50:58.470 --> 51:00.250]  Oh, me too. Well, I like
[51:00.250 --> 51:02.750]  trying new shit and I just always order the same stuff.
[51:02.850 --> 51:04.550]  So I'm in Vegas with different people.
[51:04.610 --> 51:06.670]  I'm going to try different stuff. I thought you did great.
[51:06.830 --> 51:08.550]  I thought everything you ordered was really good
[51:08.550 --> 51:10.170]  because it's what I got and I liked it.
[51:10.470 --> 51:12.570]  But yeah, I think she was
[51:12.570 --> 51:13.950]  impressed. Oh, yeah.
[51:14.470 --> 51:16.290]  I think she was impressed because you
[51:16.290 --> 51:18.190]  again, didn't say, Oh, you're British.
[51:18.330 --> 51:19.810]  She just said you have an accent.
[51:20.270 --> 51:22.210]  Also, it's Vegas where
[51:22.210 --> 51:24.130]  that's the least impressive thing in
[51:24.130 --> 51:26.330]  the world. Yeah, I think it's
[51:26.330 --> 51:28.410]  because Americans don't often have the confidence
[51:28.410 --> 51:30.430]  to call out the difference between Australian
[51:30.430 --> 51:32.570]  and British. So they just say accent.
[51:32.590 --> 51:33.970]  I get that a lot. Yeah.
[51:34.410 --> 51:34.930]  Interesting.
[51:36.530 --> 51:37.850]  But that was
[51:37.850 --> 51:39.870]  our first kind of like day
[51:39.870 --> 51:41.330]  and then, oh,
[51:41.950 --> 51:44.130]  and then we had to hide
[51:44.850 --> 51:46.230]  in our hotel room
[51:47.110 --> 51:48.070]  until Geoff
[51:48.070 --> 51:49.290]  made his way in
[51:50.070 --> 51:52.310]  and then didn't go to his hotel room
[51:52.310 --> 51:53.970]  just hung out at the sports book
[51:53.970 --> 51:55.050]  so we couldn't come down.
[51:56.290 --> 51:57.250]  For like an hour.
[51:57.970 --> 51:59.690]  No, from the time you landed
[51:59.690 --> 52:01.670]  which was like 5 or something
[52:01.670 --> 52:04.350]  until the meal at 8, we were scarce.
[52:04.830 --> 52:04.990]  Yeah.
[52:05.650 --> 52:07.970]  We had gone way before and then had to
[52:07.970 --> 52:09.810]  go over to the casino early,
[52:09.910 --> 52:11.810]  the other casino early and it was like,
[52:11.810 --> 52:13.270]  we were getting
[52:13.730 --> 52:15.150]  texts from Kent too, who was
[52:15.150 --> 52:16.070]  keeping us
[52:17.670 --> 52:18.950]  informed of where you were. He was like,
[52:19.070 --> 52:20.410]  GOTUS is on the move.
[52:21.250 --> 52:23.650]  We were like, what the fuck, Geoff of the
[52:23.650 --> 52:24.650]  United States?
[52:27.110 --> 52:27.750]  I forgot
[52:27.750 --> 52:29.090]  you guys called me GOTUS all weekend.
[52:30.710 --> 52:31.630]  And what was the deal
[52:31.630 --> 52:33.450]  with my cousin bringing all of his climbing
[52:33.450 --> 52:33.790]  gear?
[52:36.670 --> 52:37.550]  Well, your
[52:39.550 --> 52:39.990]  idiotic
[52:39.990 --> 52:41.910]  cousin decided to fly
[52:41.910 --> 52:43.990]  at what, a flight that
[52:43.990 --> 52:45.890]  was 10 minutes apart from your one?
[52:46.410 --> 52:47.990]  We were all in Vegas and he
[52:47.990 --> 52:49.930]  was like headed to the
[52:49.930 --> 52:52.090]  airport and we were like 6 hours into our time
[52:52.090 --> 52:52.430]  wasting.
[52:53.730 --> 52:56.330]  And he was like, oh yeah, I didn't even think about it.
[52:56.810 --> 52:58.090]  I knew Gavin
[52:58.090 --> 52:59.890]  was upset that this could get
[52:59.890 --> 53:01.970]  blown because he started
[53:01.970 --> 53:04.030]  participating in the group text
[53:04.030 --> 53:05.890]  and he said, Chris, if you
[53:05.890 --> 53:07.950]  fuck this for me and I woke up
[53:07.950 --> 53:09.870]  at 5am for nothing,
[53:10.110 --> 53:11.350]  I'm gonna be pissed.
[53:11.790 --> 53:12.530]  I didn't say that.
[53:14.370 --> 53:15.830]  So he decided
[53:15.830 --> 53:16.670]  that he would
[53:17.830 --> 53:19.970]  mitigate that by, if he bumped into you
[53:19.970 --> 53:21.630]  in the airport, he could say that he was on a
[53:21.630 --> 53:23.070]  climbing trip because he loves climbing.
[53:24.290 --> 53:25.130]  So he was
[53:26.130 --> 53:27.270]  sending us a picture of
[53:27.270 --> 53:29.470]  a climbing bag and a helmet
[53:29.470 --> 53:31.390]  that he was gonna take to the airport.
[53:31.690 --> 53:33.670]  It was so crazy
[53:33.670 --> 53:35.790]  that he was just like, oh, I'm just gonna
[53:35.790 --> 53:37.270]  repack all my stuff.
[53:37.850 --> 53:39.930]  And it's like, what do you, what does that mean?
[53:40.090 --> 53:41.730]  And he's like, well, this way,
[53:42.410 --> 53:43.770]  you know, he
[53:43.770 --> 53:45.210]  won't know that I'm going to Vegas.
[53:45.610 --> 53:47.890]  Geoff told us later, he's like, oh, if I saw Chris at the airport
[53:47.890 --> 53:49.250]  I would never think he was going to Vegas.
[53:49.550 --> 53:51.890]  No, it would've crossed my mind in a million years. He could've just been like,
[53:51.950 --> 53:53.950]  he travels for work like 30 months
[53:53.950 --> 53:55.670]  out of the year. He could've just been like,
[53:55.750 --> 53:57.590]  oh, small world, yeah, I'm headed to fuckin'
[53:58.090 --> 53:59.810]  Kuala Lumpur for the weekend or whatever.
[54:00.290 --> 54:01.670]  I'd be like, oh, cool, man, well,
[54:01.770 --> 54:03.770]  you know, stay safe. Love ya.
[54:03.770 --> 54:05.990]  It was so nice to see Chris. I hadn't seen him
[54:05.990 --> 54:07.930]  in probably five years.
[54:08.330 --> 54:08.590]  I love it.
[54:09.090 --> 54:11.350]  I never met him. He's a great guy.
[54:11.790 --> 54:13.750]  He's the fuckin' best. I love
[54:13.750 --> 54:15.870]  that you guys all got to experience
[54:15.870 --> 54:17.870]  my favorite thing about him, which is
[54:17.870 --> 54:20.050]  that he's like professionally late
[54:20.050 --> 54:22.070]  to everything. Dude, that was crazy.
[54:22.930 --> 54:23.910]  I don't know how else
[54:23.910 --> 54:26.050]  to describe it. It's like, he does it in a way
[54:26.050 --> 54:27.990]  that seems like, oh, this dude's a pro
[54:27.990 --> 54:28.690]  at being late.
[54:31.190 --> 54:31.750]  It is
[54:31.750 --> 54:33.510]  always, in every circumstance,
[54:33.670 --> 54:35.590]  he's late, and there's always a reason and an
[54:35.590 --> 54:37.510]  excuse that's plausible. It's really impressive.
[54:38.650 --> 54:39.610]  He was a very
[54:40.010 --> 54:41.630]  cool guy. I just never
[54:42.630 --> 54:43.930]  met him, never seen him.
[54:44.150 --> 54:45.470]  I had a great weekend with him.
[54:45.530 --> 54:46.950]  It was a lot of fun.
[54:47.370 --> 54:49.290]  I asked him if he's a big gambler, and he said,
[54:49.370 --> 54:51.510]  oh, I forgot my debit card and all my cash.
[54:51.650 --> 54:53.650]  Oh, yeah! Which I found out
[54:53.650 --> 54:55.610]  on the last day. I was like, goddammit, Chris,
[54:55.790 --> 54:57.350]  here, here's some money, man.
[54:57.630 --> 54:59.630]  I just thought he was just quietly not gambling.
[54:59.630 --> 55:01.370]  Not that any of us gambled a lot.
[55:01.490 --> 55:03.470]  We're mostly playing $5 on
[55:03.470 --> 55:04.490]  craps or whatever.
[55:06.010 --> 55:07.210]  I think
[55:07.210 --> 55:09.230]  almost everybody except for Gavin ended
[55:09.230 --> 55:11.730]  about even, I want to say.
[55:12.350 --> 55:12.550]  Yeah.
[55:13.430 --> 55:14.890]  Gavin ended way down.
[55:15.330 --> 55:16.550]  Way down.
[55:16.650 --> 55:19.210]  I wanted to send a picture real quick of
[55:19.210 --> 55:21.390]  Chris's repacked bag
[55:21.390 --> 55:23.830]  that he texted us to assure us
[55:23.830 --> 55:25.630]  that there's no way he was getting
[55:25.630 --> 55:26.970]  caught at this airport.
[55:26.970 --> 55:29.110]  So he took that to a fucking...
[55:29.110 --> 55:30.870]  Do you think you scared him
[55:30.870 --> 55:32.510]  into that, Gavin, with your text?
[55:32.810 --> 55:33.950]  A hundred percent.
[55:34.110 --> 55:35.510]  Yeah, I hope so.
[55:37.150 --> 55:37.750]  No doubt.
[55:39.330 --> 55:41.170]  Also, it was
[55:42.850 --> 55:43.770]  47 degrees.
[55:44.210 --> 55:44.430]  Yeah.
[55:45.030 --> 55:45.890]  That's Celsius.
[55:46.850 --> 55:48.830]  Which means it was way hotter in
[55:48.830 --> 55:51.430]  regular temperatures. I think that's like 116
[55:51.430 --> 55:51.770]  or something.
[55:53.150 --> 55:54.970]  I've been to India in the summer
[55:54.970 --> 55:56.750]  and it was hotter than that
[55:56.750 --> 55:59.130]  in Vegas. I've never experienced
[55:59.130 --> 56:01.050]  heat like that. After we got home
[56:01.050 --> 56:02.290]  because there's like a text
[56:02.850 --> 56:04.990]  chain that I guess you guys have been on for months
[56:04.990 --> 56:06.670]  that I was just added onto
[56:07.490 --> 56:09.010]  which is currently called
[56:09.010 --> 56:11.050]  it changed names constantly, but what
[56:11.050 --> 56:13.250]  is it called right now? Oh, Knees Patilla.
[56:13.830 --> 56:14.710]  Knees Patilla.
[56:15.110 --> 56:17.330]  That's another one. Oh my god.
[56:19.210 --> 56:21.090]  Well, because the only thing we had to bring
[56:21.090 --> 56:23.090]  on the trip was some like jeans
[56:23.090 --> 56:24.810]  and a smart-ish shirt
[56:24.810 --> 56:26.710]  because of the restaurant and Jack forgot his
[56:26.710 --> 56:29.190]  jeans. So he was wearing shorts
[56:29.190 --> 56:30.830]  and Kent called him Knees Patilla.
[56:31.270 --> 56:32.970]  Yeah, but I will say that
[56:32.970 --> 56:35.170]  he was better dressed than Gavin
[56:35.170 --> 56:36.770]  was, even with his shorts.
[56:37.010 --> 56:38.750]  Where's the photo you guys took of Jack
[56:38.750 --> 56:40.950]  with his giant... Oh yeah,
[56:41.050 --> 56:43.070]  do you have that, Gavin? Yeah, for some reason
[56:43.070 --> 56:45.030]  like I crouched a little bit and also I
[56:45.030 --> 56:47.030]  switched to the point five lens.
[56:47.390 --> 56:48.930]  It made him look like he was
[56:48.930 --> 56:51.210]  completely ginormous. Oh, it's...
[56:51.930 --> 56:53.310]  Yeah, you know, a DNG
[56:53.310 --> 56:55.130]  file, the regular file that we all use.
[56:55.170 --> 56:56.670]  You uploaded your DONG file.
[56:58.750 --> 56:59.290]  Okay, well
[56:59.290 --> 57:00.950]  that's not a real image, apparently. That's a
[57:01.510 --> 57:01.910]  DNG.
[57:02.970 --> 57:05.150]  Well, you needed a DNG
[57:05.150 --> 57:06.330]  to capture the size of Jack.
[57:06.710 --> 57:08.030]  You need a whole new format.
[57:09.570 --> 57:10.870]  While he's doing that,
[57:11.890 --> 57:13.270]  so right when we got home,
[57:13.730 --> 57:15.230]  Kent, like the next day, Kent sent
[57:15.230 --> 57:17.090]  a TikTok that
[57:18.510 --> 57:19.310]  was about
[57:19.310 --> 57:21.010]  a Delta,
[57:21.310 --> 57:23.210]  I think, Delta Airlines flight
[57:23.210 --> 57:25.330]  that was going from Vegas that weekend
[57:25.330 --> 57:27.210]  to Arizona, where
[57:27.210 --> 57:28.690]  it was... Oh, there's Nese Petillo.
[57:29.150 --> 57:31.090]  That's how he showed up at the fancy restaurant.
[57:31.190 --> 57:32.130]  Nese Petillo was so tall!
[57:32.530 --> 57:35.030]  It looks like that scene in
[57:35.030 --> 57:37.070]  Willy Wonka where he's walking down the hallway
[57:37.070 --> 57:38.410]  to the tiny door.
[57:39.390 --> 57:41.210]  Apparently, it was so
[57:41.210 --> 57:43.210]  hot in the plane while they were waiting for it to
[57:43.210 --> 57:44.990]  take off, a bunch of people passed out
[57:44.990 --> 57:46.970]  and shit themselves. Oh my god!
[57:46.970 --> 57:48.330]  Oh my god!
[57:48.530 --> 57:49.710]  Eric, you didn't see that?
[57:49.770 --> 57:52.630]  It was like
[57:53.510 --> 57:54.950]  the remembrance of
[57:54.950 --> 57:56.110]  that could've been us.
[57:56.290 --> 57:57.250]  That could've been us.
[57:58.710 --> 58:00.790]  I didn't realize that was a heat-based thing.
[58:00.890 --> 58:02.310]  I thought you would just pass out. I didn't realize
[58:02.310 --> 58:03.950]  shitting your pants was a part of that.
[58:04.070 --> 58:06.670]  I think they said at least five people shit themselves.
[58:07.030 --> 58:08.650]  That's crazy, I wonder why.
[58:09.530 --> 58:10.930]  People don't shit themselves in the cold.
[58:11.470 --> 58:12.850]  I tell you what though, that's a great excuse
[58:12.850 --> 58:13.550]  from here on out.
[58:15.770 --> 58:16.470]  That's true.
[58:16.710 --> 58:17.710]  Dude, speaking of
[58:17.710 --> 58:19.370]  Geoff shitting himself, he was
[58:20.030 --> 58:21.750]  ripping farts at the basketball game
[58:21.750 --> 58:23.730]  and you've stopped drinking years ago.
[58:23.770 --> 58:25.510]  I don't know how you do it. I remember
[58:25.510 --> 58:27.690]  your drunk farts. How do you
[58:27.690 --> 58:28.950]  still have those in the tank?
[58:29.410 --> 58:31.590]  Hey man, it turns out it wasn't the alcohol
[58:31.590 --> 58:32.550]  the magic was in me.
[58:33.030 --> 58:33.430]  Yeah.
[58:35.070 --> 58:37.490]  I mean, you're cursed
[58:37.490 --> 58:39.310]  in that way, right? You have diverticulitis.
[58:39.610 --> 58:41.230]  You've got a lot going on. Yeah, I've been in bed all week.
[58:41.230 --> 58:42.870]  This is my first day out of bed actually, diverticulitis.
[58:43.130 --> 58:45.170]  The second I got home from Vegas, I got hit
[58:45.170 --> 58:47.190]  with it. Like the worst it's been
[58:47.190 --> 58:48.930]  in like three years. It's okay though, I'm fine now.
[58:50.170 --> 58:51.250]  Yeah, so the next
[58:51.250 --> 58:52.710]  day we went to the NBA.
[58:53.210 --> 58:55.130]  How did it start? Oh, it started with breakfast
[58:56.230 --> 58:57.210]  where Chris got
[58:57.210 --> 58:59.310]  lost in another hotel somehow.
[58:59.330 --> 59:00.370]  He went to another hotel?
[59:01.330 --> 59:01.550]  What?
[59:03.090 --> 59:04.690]  Wait, what? Like he...
[59:05.050 --> 59:06.750]  The hotels are connected?
[59:07.150 --> 59:09.290]  He walked out of a hotel to a different one for breakfast.
[59:09.890 --> 59:11.030]  Oh. So he was
[59:11.030 --> 59:11.930]  20 minutes late.
[59:13.330 --> 59:15.170]  Which by the way, I'd like to point out
[59:15.170 --> 59:16.690]  he sounds like a goddamn idiot.
[59:17.030 --> 59:19.010]  My cousin is incredibly smart
[59:19.010 --> 59:21.070]  and incredibly successful. Way more
[59:21.070 --> 59:22.230]  successful than I am.
[59:22.550 --> 59:24.950]  We look like shit. He's so
[59:24.950 --> 59:26.910]  put together you would never guess
[59:26.910 --> 59:28.430]  that he's the late one.
[59:29.070 --> 59:30.370]  Oh my god.
[59:31.130 --> 59:32.750]  He's like one of those people you see on TV
[59:32.750 --> 59:35.290]  that you're like, man, life's unfair.
[59:35.890 --> 59:36.810]  Yeah. He's got it all.
[59:36.810 --> 59:38.510]  It's weird. He seems disciplined
[59:38.510 --> 59:39.970]  except when it comes to time.
[59:40.710 --> 59:42.750]  Yeah, everybody's gotta have like one chink
[59:42.750 --> 59:43.870]  in their armor, I guess, right?
[59:44.270 --> 59:46.730]  So we
[59:46.730 --> 59:48.110]  had breakfast and then
[59:48.770 --> 59:50.590]  we all went to NBA Summer League.
[59:51.950 --> 59:52.570]  What did you see?
[59:52.930 --> 59:53.250]  What games?
[59:54.030 --> 59:56.790]  How many games did we see? We watched three games.
[59:56.930 --> 59:59.010]  We saw the Timberwolves and I think the Mavs
[59:59.010 --> 01:00:00.390]  play at the start.
[01:00:01.090 --> 01:00:03.190]  Then we saw...
[01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:04.870]  Who did we see
[01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:05.250]  next?
[01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:09.030]  Back-to-back-to-back games or how does that work?
[01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:10.550]  They don't even wait until they're off the
[01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:11.750]  fucking court, dude.
[01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:14.450]  It's awesome. It was wild.
[01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:16.790]  It's so fucking awesome
[01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:18.130]  how quickly they cycle them through.
[01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:21.310]  Okay, that was the...
[01:00:21.310 --> 01:00:22.550]  That was...
[01:00:23.970 --> 01:00:24.730]  And there's no
[01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:26.470]  difference to the rules for the Summer League.
[01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:27.410]  It's shorter.
[01:00:29.050 --> 01:00:30.170]  Is that 10 minute quarters?
[01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:32.850]  Yeah, 10 minute quarters. We saw Charlotte
[01:00:32.850 --> 01:00:34.370]  against Minnesota.
[01:00:35.050 --> 01:00:36.710]  We saw the Bucks against the Kings.
[01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:38.890]  And then we watched the Celtics against the Magic.
[01:00:39.490 --> 01:00:40.790]  We did not stay
[01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:42.870]  for the Grizzlies and
[01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:44.870]  the Suns because why would
[01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:46.950]  we do that? Yeah, we were just done at that point.
[01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:48.990]  Three straight NBA games was fucking awesome.
[01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:50.750]  The arena, the Thomas and Mac
[01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:52.710]  Center was fucking awesome. Eric and I
[01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:54.790]  ran into a bunch of community members out
[01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:56.470]  there. We saw some
[01:00:57.290 --> 01:00:58.850]  massive fucking dudes
[01:00:58.850 --> 01:01:00.990]  who play college
[01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:03.050]  football at... I want to say
[01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:05.250]  Washington State. Is that right? I thought it was like Colorado.
[01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:06.530]  I thought it was Washington.
[01:01:06.850 --> 01:01:08.730]  Number 80 and 8, right? Or 8 and 80.
[01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:10.750]  And they have a podcast they do about
[01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:13.010]  mental health and sports called Elevate Podcast
[01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:14.890]  I think. But they were really
[01:01:14.890 --> 01:01:17.090]  fucking nice. And it was like
[01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:19.190]  shaking Andre the Giant's hand when I...
[01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:20.450]  I felt so tiny.
[01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:22.610]  And...
[01:01:23.070 --> 01:01:24.030]  How did Jack feel?
[01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:27.010]  How did New Jack feel? I don't know. He was somewhere
[01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:28.310]  playing craps in the bathroom.
[01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:30.630]  He...
[01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:32.430]  That dude, like...
[01:01:33.370 --> 01:01:34.090]  He likes
[01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:36.210]  Vegas. He likes
[01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:38.190]  gambling in a way that like...
[01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:40.250]  Jack's very responsible
[01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:42.310]  and stuff, but he should never move there. That's all I'll say.
[01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:43.590]  He should never live in Las Vegas.
[01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:46.350]  He likes finding the cheapest
[01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:48.410]  table to play
[01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:49.610]  the game at.
[01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:52.270]  Ridiculous. Well, that's a lot safer, isn't it?
[01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:54.470]  Yeah, I think he just likes to play and he doesn't want to gamble
[01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:55.910]  a lot of money. I get it. It's like a $5
[01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:57.910]  difference and it like made
[01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:58.470]  his day.
[01:01:59.810 --> 01:02:01.690]  He's like, oh, these are $20...
[01:02:01.690 --> 01:02:03.690]  Oh, it's like a $20 minimum.
[01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:05.810]  And then we go to another place, he's like, yeah, now we're talking
[01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:07.910]  $15. And it's like, you're...
[01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:09.990]  What are you talking
[01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:11.710]  about? I was...
[01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:13.690]  We played on this craps table where the...
[01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:15.910]  It was confusing the hell out of me with the actual
[01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:17.830]  real craps table with everyone's chips
[01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:19.890]  all over the place. Sure. I was just
[01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:21.870]  watching Jack losing track of what he had down
[01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:23.930]  there. But then we played one where it was like a digital
[01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:25.830]  table, but you could
[01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:27.870]  still throw dice on it and then you could control
[01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:29.770]  all your stuff on a little screen in front of you.
[01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:31.890]  And, uh, I was watching
[01:02:31.890 --> 01:02:33.990]  Jack on that and I was like, you know what? I can kind of...
[01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:35.870]  I can kind of get a handle on this. I feel like
[01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:37.650]  maybe I should jump in. So I
[01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:39.970]  put $20 in and
[01:02:39.970 --> 01:02:42.010]  I tried to... It like added credit
[01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:43.850]  to the top of the screen. So I tried to
[01:02:43.850 --> 01:02:45.990]  drag, um, money down
[01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:47.070]  onto the pass line.
[01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:50.190]  But, um, it...
[01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:51.750]  Instead of like dragging
[01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:53.750]  the 20
[01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:55.750]  onto the pass line, it like... because it was
[01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:57.510]  a drag and not a press, it put
[01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:59.770]  $5 on everything along the
[01:02:59.770 --> 01:03:01.210]  path I dragged on. And then
[01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:03.630]  it immediately said, bet's closed!
[01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:04.730]  I was like, oh shit!
[01:03:05.890 --> 01:03:07.530]  I had stuff all over the thing!
[01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:09.170]  I had like one of them in A, I had like
[01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:11.310]  some on the field.
[01:03:11.810 --> 01:03:13.850]  I wouldn't be surprised if I had a come bet somehow.
[01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:15.590]  I mean, like, Gavin
[01:03:15.590 --> 01:03:17.730]  keeps saying like, oh, the machine did this.
[01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:19.770]  You didn't have to drag
[01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:21.450]  anything. I'd never done it before!
[01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:23.130]  I was like, can I bet?
[01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:25.390]  I drag every time
[01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:27.690]  and it worked fine. You, once again, Gavin and
[01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:29.850]  Chris, could not fucking get it.
[01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:31.670]  Dude, it was immediately... I didn't
[01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:33.650]  realize I had like one second of betting
[01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:35.210]  left. I was just trying to get my shit
[01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:37.330]  close to me. And it just went
[01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:39.390]  all over the board and locked me out immediately.
[01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:41.050]  And Jack just...
[01:03:41.590 --> 01:03:43.370]  Jack almost fell on the floor. Oh, it was just
[01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:45.670]  a fun, incompetent time
[01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:47.210]  in general. How did you do?
[01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:48.710]  You win that bet?
[01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:50.910]  You did okay.
[01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:53.530]  Overall, I think
[01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:55.190]  I went like 150 up on
[01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:57.330]  craps and I used it just to
[01:03:57.330 --> 01:03:58.430]  pay Eric back for the meal.
[01:03:58.790 --> 01:04:01.050]  And then you finished up for the weekend then, right?
[01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:02.810]  No!
[01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:05.690]  What happened?
[01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:07.270]  Well, just with all my other
[01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:08.830]  roulette losses.
[01:04:08.890 --> 01:04:11.230]  Oh, that was before, okay. I was gonna say
[01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:13.350]  like, I'm glad you didn't lose more money
[01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:14.990]  but I wish you could've
[01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:17.070]  because you have such
[01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:18.950]  a system where you're like 100
[01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:20.830]  win 100, leave.
[01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:23.110]  You almost fucked up
[01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:24.990]  like six Vegas trips
[01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:26.150]  in one go.
[01:04:26.410 --> 01:04:29.050]  I wish you could've just kept going. I wish you could've
[01:04:29.050 --> 01:04:31.010]  just kept picking colors. You would've been in your
[01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:32.990]  head on the next one, like you definitely would've put
[01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:35.050]  on green, I imagine. You have to
[01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:36.930]  have two in a row and two separate
[01:04:36.930 --> 01:04:39.090]  tables. I can definitely see why people
[01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:40.650]  just lose their entire lives to gambling.
[01:04:40.830 --> 01:04:42.990]  Because you end up looking... I didn't walk this path
[01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:44.410]  but you end up looking down the path of like,
[01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:46.470]  I probably should just put
[01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:48.930]  200, you know, and I won't lose
[01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:50.150]  twice and I'll be back where I started.
[01:04:50.690 --> 01:04:52.290]  I didn't do it but that was
[01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:55.010]  easily a path to be walked.
[01:04:55.310 --> 01:04:56.910]  Yeah, death trying to get back
[01:04:56.910 --> 01:04:58.990]  to even. Not even profit, just back
[01:04:58.990 --> 01:04:59.790]  to where you started.
[01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:03.310]  We also caused a security
[01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:05.050]  meltdown at the
[01:05:05.050 --> 01:05:06.930]  NBA Summer League, unfortunately.
[01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:08.830]  Which just
[01:05:08.830 --> 01:05:10.990]  kind of spiraled out of control
[01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:12.190]  on us really fast.
[01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:14.210]  You wanna talk about it next episode?
[01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:16.390]  Yeah, I guess we'll talk about it next episode.
[01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:19.030]  Can I have a theory as to what caused
[01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:20.970]  the security meltdown? Can I make a guess right now?
[01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:22.890]  I know you're at the
[01:05:22.890 --> 01:05:24.830]  Summer League, a lot of NBA players, they're tall, you
[01:05:24.830 --> 01:05:27.050]  expected it. They've never seen a man taller than Jack
[01:05:27.050 --> 01:05:28.890]  in those shorts. They didn't know what to do.
[01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:30.630]  They were concerned. Very close.
[01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:32.910]  If you wanna know what
[01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:34.930]  happened to cause a security meltdown
[01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:36.690]  at the NBA
[01:05:36.690 --> 01:05:38.930]  Summer League, you'll have to tune in to episode
[01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.990]  166 of
[01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:42.990]  the F*** Face podcast. Oh my god,
[01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:44.390]  there you have it. Our very own
[01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:46.650]  Who Shot JR style cliffhanger
[01:05:46.650 --> 01:05:47.590]  right here.
[01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:50.890]  Damn. That was action
[01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:52.970]  packed. I still don't know how long
[01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:53.730]  that episode was.
[01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:55.610]  I have no clue.
[01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:58.910]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at
[01:05:58.910 --> 01:06:00.810]  next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:02.890]  It is 100% the summer
[01:06:02.890 --> 01:06:04.730]  of 98. Let's talk about
[01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:06.770]  basketball. More Vegas discussion?
[01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:08.830]  The sphere is insane.
[01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:10.970]  Kerpol exists. Those chips
[01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:12.770]  are bonkers. And once again,
[01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:14.230]  Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:06:14.590 --> 01:06:16.690]  All that and more on next week's episode of
[01:06:16.690 --> 01:06:17.230]  F*** Face.
