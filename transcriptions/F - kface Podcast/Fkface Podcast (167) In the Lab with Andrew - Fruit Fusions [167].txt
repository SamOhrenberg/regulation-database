[00:10.640 --> 00:14.020]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:14.280 --> 00:18.220]  My name is Geoff Ramsey and with me as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[00:18.640 --> 00:18.920]  Hello.
[00:19.880 --> 00:20.680]  Hello Gavin.
[00:20.900 --> 00:20.920]  Hello.
[00:20.980 --> 00:26.260]  Eric, you said something that might help. I have a mystery. A small, tiny mystery.
[00:26.480 --> 00:28.280]  It's not a big mystery, it's just a little baby mystery.
[00:28.860 --> 00:31.940]  And I think you might have just given me a clue to help answer it.
[00:32.280 --> 00:35.160]  When you were reading through what we talked about last recording,
[00:35.160 --> 00:39.860]  which was two weeks ago, I guess? Three weeks ago?
[00:40.140 --> 00:41.120]  Because I went out of town...
[00:41.120 --> 00:41.580]  Was it two weeks ago?
[00:41.720 --> 00:42.220]  I think it was two.
[00:42.560 --> 00:42.960]  It was two.
[00:43.420 --> 00:44.240]  Yeah, it was two.
[00:44.560 --> 00:48.000]  Two weeks ago, you said poop brain? What is that?
[00:48.240 --> 00:53.220]  I think I remember. I think that's when you were talking about how people who shit more get less dumb.
[00:53.280 --> 00:53.900]  Oh yeah, have higher intelligence.
[00:53.900 --> 00:56.620]  So you were like, oh, you're Einstein because you shit so much.
[00:56.780 --> 00:57.960]  That would be correct, yes.
[00:58.560 --> 01:01.800]  All the alcohol f***ed you, so it brought you...
[01:01.800 --> 01:08.320]  Yeah, you've evened out, you've cancelled out copious booze with copious shitting and you've sort of landed right in the middle.
[01:08.600 --> 01:09.700]  Well, I don't know that that helps.
[01:10.360 --> 01:14.580]  I was looking over at my notes and I have a note that I, the old note you don't recognize,
[01:14.880 --> 01:19.420]  I wrote down sometime between that recording and when I got back from Michigan,
[01:20.060 --> 01:21.580]  I wrote down poop game.
[01:22.840 --> 01:24.600]  And I don't know what that means.
[01:25.100 --> 01:27.180]  And I was hoping that would help, but that doesn't.
[01:27.260 --> 01:28.420]  I don't think that had anything to do with that.
[01:28.920 --> 01:31.240]  Was that the sequel to Reindeer Games?
[01:31.800 --> 01:36.560]  Or like maybe I was trying to step up my poop game, but I got a pretty strong poop game as it is.
[01:36.800 --> 01:38.440]  Yeah, I can't imagine it getting better.
[01:38.840 --> 01:41.160]  Were you trying to incorporate shitting into some classic games?
[01:42.500 --> 01:44.860]  Like Twister, like this is like a new color.
[01:45.700 --> 01:46.580]  Oh, f***.
[01:47.400 --> 01:48.720]  You just have to shit right there.
[01:48.940 --> 01:52.420]  I think you're taking like performance enhancing drugs if there's like a poop game.
[01:53.880 --> 01:54.900]  Shits and lettuce.
[01:56.320 --> 01:58.480]  Oh, maybe it was something about...
[01:58.480 --> 02:01.160]  Maybe somebody recently pooped in a famous game.
[02:01.880 --> 02:02.800]  God, I don't know.
[02:03.200 --> 02:05.560]  Well, anyway, if anybody has any ideas for...
[02:05.560 --> 02:11.080]  Sounds like Gavin already has a bunch, but if anybody has any additional poop game ideas, send them my way.
[02:11.180 --> 02:13.080]  I have no f***ing clue what I was getting at there.
[02:13.100 --> 02:15.720]  Do you think you could have written it on the toilet in your shitshades?
[02:16.160 --> 02:16.840]  Yeah, probably.
[02:17.280 --> 02:23.280]  Which, by the way, just so we're clear, I want you guys to know, I do wear those almost every time I shit still.
[02:23.740 --> 02:24.960]  Like I'm keeping it real.
[02:24.960 --> 02:28.320]  Assumption. I don't think either of us thought anything else.
[02:28.420 --> 02:29.980]  It wasn't a fad. No.
[02:30.160 --> 02:35.280]  I didn't want you guys to think that I'm some sort of a fly-by-night cool shitter. I'm not. I'm in it for the long haul.
[02:35.640 --> 02:38.420]  Can you do me a favor and never lend me those?
[02:39.060 --> 02:40.080]  Yeah, of course, man.
[02:40.260 --> 02:43.460]  Oh, what a move that is.
[02:43.540 --> 02:44.940]  What if I already have?
[02:45.180 --> 02:50.280]  It's like a way bigger rate of getting pink eye from those, or do you think it's like the same?
[02:50.680 --> 02:51.360]  I think it's the same.
[02:52.880 --> 02:55.160]  Or do you think he's immune to pink eye?
[02:55.580 --> 02:56.540]  I've never had it.
[02:56.700 --> 03:01.840]  Because he's constantly, wow, nose flaps and pink eye resistance. You're quite the superhero.
[03:02.700 --> 03:04.900]  Oh, no, I've had pink eye. Shit.
[03:06.640 --> 03:12.660]  Yeah, I definitely had pink eye once when I was like 15 or 16. I remember it hurt like a motherfucker. It itched.
[03:13.500 --> 03:14.040]  Yeah, it sucked.
[03:14.700 --> 03:14.840]  Huh.
[03:14.840 --> 03:22.900]  Well, maybe you're immune since then. You're so much... I would say you have more shit near your eyes than most people with your shit shades.
[03:23.440 --> 03:29.920]  No, I think the shades protect me from the... I think they act as like poop particle blockers.
[03:30.600 --> 03:33.140]  Yeah, I mean, they're definitely getting it from the front and they're blocking all that.
[03:33.560 --> 03:33.700]  Yeah.
[03:34.200 --> 03:39.120]  I feel like most of the shit particles, if you're a normal anatomy, would be coming from behind you.
[03:43.100 --> 03:44.940]  That's a good point. I hadn't considered that.
[03:46.120 --> 03:47.660]  Funneling it all into your eyes.
[03:47.700 --> 03:52.020]  This is a weird episode already. I feel weird. We are recording late.
[03:52.160 --> 03:56.780]  We don't ever really record this kind of late when we do the standard recording on Thursday.
[03:56.800 --> 04:02.080]  We're starting about 18 minutes late, not for any reason, but because we were recording.
[04:02.080 --> 04:07.660]  I mean, for a reason, we were recording a test episode of something else earlier and then we had to go run through some business.
[04:07.660 --> 04:14.120]  But I wondered if starting 7 or 8 or 9 or 15 minutes or whatever off would affect me in some way.
[04:14.180 --> 04:14.840]  And I think it has.
[04:15.160 --> 04:15.780]  You think it has?
[04:16.220 --> 04:23.000]  We also had to wait for Andrew, who I ran through some stuff that we had to talk about for business.
[04:23.580 --> 04:29.200]  And then Andrew was like, I need 10 minutes and then disappeared and kept on muting so fast.
[04:29.280 --> 04:30.460]  I didn't know he was unmuting.
[04:31.560 --> 04:33.120]  I feel like he's been in the lab.
[04:33.120 --> 04:35.860]  OK, well, here's the thing.
[04:36.420 --> 04:40.940]  I'm juicing a watermelon right now, so if I'm a little off, that's why.
[04:42.040 --> 04:45.760]  We've been talking a lot about the lab recently.
[04:46.140 --> 04:48.760]  I've brought the lab to the podcast.
[04:49.540 --> 04:50.440]  I'm preparing.
[04:50.700 --> 04:59.260]  As you may remember, we talked about different fruit combinations that are not common, that we've never seen compared.
[04:59.260 --> 05:04.020]  So I went to the store and I bought all the fruit that we have.
[05:04.200 --> 05:06.900]  And I got a little hand juicer.
[05:07.380 --> 05:12.420]  And I didn't want it to go bad ahead of time, so I thought, oh, I'll just juice this fruit.
[05:12.920 --> 05:15.380]  Put the lab on the show while we're recording.
[05:15.640 --> 05:18.040]  Already run into a massive issue with the watermelon.
[05:19.300 --> 05:20.400]  Juice is everywhere.
[05:20.700 --> 05:22.140]  I'm glad that I put a plate down.
[05:22.740 --> 05:24.580]  But I'm going to have to clean that.
[05:24.960 --> 05:25.300]  Hang on.
[05:25.440 --> 05:27.860]  Are you just using a lime juicer?
[05:28.720 --> 05:29.880]  Oh, yeah.
[05:30.020 --> 05:31.720]  For watermelon?
[05:32.920 --> 05:36.780]  Yeah, well, because that's the best juicing tool I have.
[05:37.060 --> 05:41.100]  Imagine the size of a lime and then imagine something slightly smaller than that.
[05:41.180 --> 05:42.640]  That is what he's juicing with.
[05:42.760 --> 05:47.480]  Well, the point is to separate the pulp from the juice.
[05:47.760 --> 05:54.160]  But watermelon is mostly just like slightly firmer juice where a lime is not.
[05:54.160 --> 05:55.280]  So this is what I'm doing.
[05:56.380 --> 05:58.060]  I'm going to juice everything.
[05:58.340 --> 06:00.300]  I have little plastic shot glasses.
[06:01.640 --> 06:03.620]  I'm going to juice them half and half.
[06:03.980 --> 06:05.040]  Then I'm going to mix them.
[06:05.360 --> 06:06.600]  Then I'm going to try it.
[06:06.680 --> 06:08.700]  We'll see if the combination is good or not.
[06:08.700 --> 06:10.500]  So we're currently in the lab with you right now.
[06:11.300 --> 06:13.340]  We're in the lab as we speak.
[06:13.540 --> 06:15.100]  And I even have other lab work to share.
[06:15.120 --> 06:15.560]  This is amazing.
[06:15.820 --> 06:18.580]  This is the current lab situation.
[06:19.060 --> 06:21.360]  I need to unclog the thing of watermelon.
[06:21.920 --> 06:23.700]  And then I'm going to move on to...
[06:23.700 --> 06:24.560]  What's the next thing?
[06:24.560 --> 06:25.240]  What did I combine?
[06:25.680 --> 06:26.160]  Grapes.
[06:26.380 --> 06:27.260]  That'll be an easy one.
[06:27.900 --> 06:28.700]  That sounds delicious.
[06:28.900 --> 06:30.780]  Are you cutting chunks from the watermelon first?
[06:31.200 --> 06:37.920]  I'm slicing chunks in and then transferring it to, I guess, the lime juicer or whatever Eric said.
[06:38.100 --> 06:40.060]  Then I'm squishing it into a shot glass.
[06:41.480 --> 06:44.340]  So I'm going to continue on with this process.
[06:44.580 --> 06:46.000]  Are you a big shots guy, typically?
[06:46.960 --> 06:48.440]  No, not at all.
[06:48.700 --> 06:54.020]  I just went to the dollar store once again and secured some plastic.
[06:54.020 --> 06:57.760]  I feel like shot cups make sense for what you're doing here, though.
[06:58.000 --> 06:59.420]  I think that's the appropriate vessel.
[07:00.060 --> 07:02.700]  That might be the only appropriate thing that I've grabbed.
[07:02.860 --> 07:05.660]  And also, can I just say, tons of respect and admiration.
[07:05.900 --> 07:07.260]  I think it's awesome what you're doing.
[07:07.380 --> 07:10.980]  I'm amazed that you've brought us into the lab to watch you work.
[07:11.120 --> 07:12.120]  I think that's incredibly cool.
[07:12.380 --> 07:13.480]  I need to apologize.
[07:13.480 --> 07:22.180]  I had promised to present you guys with some grape-specific flavors from my lab work this episode.
[07:22.300 --> 07:25.820]  I just haven't been able to make my way to the lab because I was out of town.
[07:26.480 --> 07:29.740]  You're kind of a lifesaver for me, Andrew. I really appreciate it.
[07:29.760 --> 07:31.120]  Yeah, I was worried I was stepping on your toes.
[07:31.120 --> 07:35.260]  No, not at all. My toes are so fucking stupid right now. Just stomp on them.
[07:35.660 --> 07:39.720]  I'm basically taking a shift to go into the lab.
[07:41.220 --> 07:43.700]  While I do this, do you want to see the other lab work I did?
[07:44.020 --> 07:45.560]  Because I had homework. You gave me an assignment.
[07:45.920 --> 07:46.120]  Oh.
[07:46.640 --> 07:50.460]  You said that my sleep spaghetti... Sorry, I'm trying to get rid of this watermelon.
[07:50.960 --> 07:54.420]  But you said that my sleep spaghetti was al dente.
[07:54.800 --> 07:56.120]  You said it wasn't cooked.
[07:57.360 --> 07:58.040]  Al-a-dente.
[07:59.180 --> 08:00.020]  Is that al dente?
[08:01.020 --> 08:01.720]  Al dente?
[08:02.780 --> 08:04.400]  Come on, al dente is better.
[08:04.720 --> 08:06.860]  Give me al dente. This is more fun.
[08:06.860 --> 08:12.900]  Can we lobby right here and now to change it officially to al-a-dente from here on out?
[08:14.100 --> 08:15.380]  Orangutan and al-a-dente.
[08:15.540 --> 08:17.520]  That sounds way more religious than al-a-dente.
[08:17.940 --> 08:19.720]  And rubbish over trash. We can't remember.
[08:20.160 --> 08:20.400]  True.
[08:20.560 --> 08:20.960]  We can't say trash.
[08:21.120 --> 08:22.600]  Oh yeah. I'll never remember that one.
[08:22.960 --> 08:27.720]  But anyway, al-a-dente. You gave notes. You wanted it to be bent. You wanted it adjusted.
[08:28.500 --> 08:33.140]  You thought it needed more curve. It needed to cook more. Boil more, you may say.
[08:33.680 --> 08:45.320]  So I, in my great wisdom, bought a staple gun. And my idea was that I would cut them into pieces, like you suggested, and then staple gun them together.
[08:45.540 --> 08:46.260]  Staples, though?
[08:47.380 --> 08:48.420]  Yeah, well...
[08:48.420 --> 08:49.920]  Are they kept together in the socks?
[08:50.440 --> 08:57.420]  Yeah, so I would layer the socks over each other and then shoot a staple through, was my idea. That was my thought.
[08:57.660 --> 09:01.180]  Sleep staples sound less inviting to me.
[09:01.780 --> 09:07.180]  I'm less inclined to dive into the spaghetti now and catch my earlobe on a staple.
[09:07.380 --> 09:07.800]  Catch an edge.
[09:08.080 --> 09:10.060]  No, it's all locked in.
[09:10.260 --> 09:10.320]  Okay.
[09:11.300 --> 09:17.260]  I was advised after I bought this that this probably wouldn't work, and that was correct. That was a correct assumption.
[09:17.840 --> 09:22.720]  Staples do not stick into foam noodles is just a fun fact for people at home.
[09:23.920 --> 09:29.380]  I tried a variety of ways. I jammed the gun. I accidentally shot a staple across the room. It was very chaotic.
[09:29.380 --> 09:32.780]  But, did not work, unfortunately.
[09:33.320 --> 09:37.660]  However, I did get it to work. I'm not going to reveal life secrets of how we got this done.
[09:38.020 --> 09:45.140]  But may I present to you an updated, more noodle filled, more cooked, sleep spaghetti.
[09:45.460 --> 09:47.240]  Look at how comfortable that looks.
[09:47.540 --> 09:47.940]  Oh!
[09:48.500 --> 09:49.860]  Look at that right there.
[09:50.740 --> 09:51.700]  He's done it.
[09:52.220 --> 09:53.820]  That's looking good.
[09:53.820 --> 09:59.200]  You got bends. You got twists. Nix's, they look like cigarette butts.
[09:59.460 --> 10:00.780]  They do. They definitely do.
[10:00.780 --> 10:07.880]  Not necessarily wrong. They're bendy. There's also a product I'd like to introduce called the sleep macaroni.
[10:08.020 --> 10:11.620]  Where it's just a singular strand. Pretty good for sleeping.
[10:12.220 --> 10:14.440]  Will you get a bruised neck from it? Yes.
[10:15.100 --> 10:20.180]  But, until that point, it is very comfy.
[10:20.180 --> 10:24.240]  You know, I think I see what you've done. Just kind of looking at it.
[10:24.280 --> 10:26.420]  It seems to have worked really well.
[10:26.680 --> 10:32.260]  I saw one of the comment leavers made a suggestion that I thought was pretty brilliant.
[10:32.740 --> 10:40.240]  They said you should just take one of the long pool noodles and then just cut along it in a spiral as you go up.
[10:40.320 --> 10:42.740]  Almost like a telephone cord.
[10:43.460 --> 10:47.860]  And that might allow some maximum flexibility while maintaining the structure.
[10:48.360 --> 10:50.020]  Maintaining it as one solid piece.
[10:50.520 --> 10:55.220]  But, clearly you've come to a different solution that seems to work just as well.
[10:56.220 --> 11:00.440]  Oh, it works great. I will say it's better than just bending and uncut one.
[11:01.020 --> 11:04.620]  Definite problems with that. I have slapped my lamp.
[11:05.000 --> 11:07.840]  Because you bend it and then you lay on it.
[11:08.140 --> 11:11.140]  And then, I have a tendency to move in my sleep.
[11:11.360 --> 11:15.220]  I woke myself up last night trying to use it because it slapped the wall.
[11:15.220 --> 11:18.120]  I was like holding it down and it hit the wall and it spooked me.
[11:19.620 --> 11:22.760]  I guess the main question is, is this any more comfy?
[11:23.300 --> 11:26.000]  And the answer to that is absolutely not. It's terrible.
[11:26.400 --> 11:28.080]  Do not use this.
[11:28.220 --> 11:29.840]  So, it is not a great product.
[11:30.160 --> 11:33.680]  Well, let's not throw shade at Sleep Spaghetti.
[11:35.100 --> 11:38.060]  It clearly doesn't work. I don't know that it's Sleep Spaghetti's fault.
[11:38.160 --> 11:40.140]  I think it might be the pool noodle's fault.
[11:40.300 --> 11:44.280]  I don't look at a pool noodle and think I want to cuddle up with that in a bed.
[11:44.280 --> 11:46.520]  I look at a pillow and think that.
[11:46.620 --> 11:51.940]  So, I would think that the consistency would be somewhere less than pool noodle but more than pillow made.
[11:52.060 --> 11:53.640]  So, like long pillows.
[11:53.940 --> 11:57.220]  I love the idea of it being full because you slapped your lamp.
[11:58.580 --> 12:04.920]  Oh, yeah. I was terrified that it... I mean, if you're sharing a bed with someone, it is a dangerous thing.
[12:05.960 --> 12:08.180]  Oh, that cracked me up.
[12:08.340 --> 12:08.940]  That's so funny.
[12:08.940 --> 12:14.360]  Yeah, so you're telling Andrew to replace the... well, change everything about it basically.
[12:14.700 --> 12:22.800]  Well, no. I think you can take the filling out and just stuff it with like batting or something and achieve a much comfier result.
[12:23.080 --> 12:26.360]  But I also don't want to... listen, this is Andrew's process.
[12:26.840 --> 12:29.340]  And I don't want to get in the way of Andrew's process.
[12:29.520 --> 12:30.960]  Everybody creates differently.
[12:31.440 --> 12:36.380]  The road to the final product is forked many times over.
[12:36.380 --> 12:39.620]  And everybody takes a different fork at different points.
[12:39.740 --> 12:43.520]  So, the important thing is that we get there at the end.
[12:43.580 --> 12:44.500]  And I think we will.
[12:45.120 --> 12:50.960]  So, I've just been reticent to throw too much suggestion towards Andrew.
[12:51.040 --> 12:52.980]  Because I don't want to get in the way of his creative process.
[12:53.200 --> 12:55.120]  What was that convention that had the ball pit?
[12:58.720 --> 12:59.120]  Dashcon.
[12:59.560 --> 13:00.160]  Dashcon, yeah.
[13:00.160 --> 13:04.140]  Because I'm thinking next RTX, we could potentially have a big spaghetti pit.
[13:04.420 --> 13:05.560]  A big sleep spaghetti pit.
[13:05.560 --> 13:07.420]  Do you think we could do a sleep spaghetti pit?
[13:07.800 --> 13:08.420]  I think so.
[13:08.880 --> 13:14.080]  Didn't that adult actress jump in that ball pit recently and broke her back?
[13:14.100 --> 13:15.660]  Yes, that was at Twitchcon.
[13:16.060 --> 13:16.780]  Twitchcon, yeah.
[13:16.960 --> 13:17.480]  Wait, what happened?
[13:20.100 --> 13:20.540]  She...
[13:21.380 --> 13:22.780]  Adriana Chechnik, I think.
[13:23.180 --> 13:25.440]  They always talk about her on the YMH podcast.
[13:26.020 --> 13:31.560]  She jumped into a foam pit and literally broke her back.
[13:31.920 --> 13:32.540]  Oh, God.
[13:32.680 --> 13:34.000]  I think I heard about that.
[13:34.300 --> 13:34.480]  Yeah.
[13:34.480 --> 13:34.700]  Yeah.
[13:34.980 --> 13:36.240]  Had to have surgery and stuff.
[13:36.280 --> 13:37.540]  Emergency surgery and stuff.
[13:37.680 --> 13:37.980]  Terrible.
[13:38.120 --> 13:38.460]  Awful.
[13:38.840 --> 13:39.360]  Just terrible.
[13:41.620 --> 13:43.520]  If we're shifting gears out of the lab...
[13:43.520 --> 13:46.020]  Unless we're still in the lab for the juice, I don't know where the juice lands.
[13:47.440 --> 13:51.060]  I'm juicing grapes as we speak, so feel free to take us out.
[13:51.420 --> 13:52.100]  I just...
[13:52.100 --> 13:52.800]  I have a shot ready.
[13:52.840 --> 13:54.020]  I wanted to...
[13:54.760 --> 13:57.940]  I wanted to bring up that the Panton collection comes out...
[13:57.940 --> 13:58.540]  Oh, no.
[13:58.860 --> 14:02.840]  ...on 8-25, which is just a couple of weeks away.
[14:02.840 --> 14:06.100]  It'll be Friday the 25th at 10 a.m.
[14:06.320 --> 14:09.540]  And the Panton collection is something that we've waited on for a long time.
[14:09.920 --> 14:10.020]  Yes.
[14:10.740 --> 14:12.010]  And I just sort of want to give...
[14:14.500 --> 14:14.960]  No!
[14:16.420 --> 14:23.220]  So, I have stopped going to merch meetings because it felt awkward them saying the Panton collection.
[14:23.320 --> 14:24.700]  I didn't really know what it is.
[14:26.140 --> 14:27.060]  That's horrendous.
[14:28.260 --> 14:29.060]  That's not it.
[14:29.360 --> 14:31.940]  We have your face on a ball of lava that you can buy.
[14:31.940 --> 14:32.180]  No!
[14:32.740 --> 14:32.760]  Yeah.
[14:33.500 --> 14:34.080]  No!
[14:34.340 --> 14:36.060]  We also have...
[14:36.060 --> 14:37.160]  That looks so bad!
[14:37.720 --> 14:39.760]  It's also a sunshade for your car.
[14:40.520 --> 14:42.000]  Yeah, I'm koozy down there.
[14:42.300 --> 14:44.040]  But it's also a koozy thing.
[14:45.060 --> 14:45.440]  No!
[14:46.700 --> 14:47.660]  Oh, no!
[14:47.680 --> 14:51.220]  It's basically anything that needs to have, like, a wraparound design.
[14:53.800 --> 14:54.960]  It is...
[14:54.960 --> 14:56.740]  And I will say, that is true.
[14:56.900 --> 14:59.040]  You have stopped coming to these meetings.
[14:59.980 --> 15:01.100]  And that's fine.
[15:01.620 --> 15:03.600]  You can not come to the meetings. It's okay.
[15:03.700 --> 15:04.740]  But then this happens.
[15:05.020 --> 15:05.960]  Oh, I like going to them.
[15:07.200 --> 15:10.200]  On the one side of the sunshade is Andrew's giant face.
[15:10.480 --> 15:10.840]  No!
[15:11.340 --> 15:17.620]  And on the other side of this sunshade, I'm a really big fan of...
[15:17.620 --> 15:18.900]  If I can get this thing to paste.
[15:19.100 --> 15:19.620]  There we go.
[15:20.120 --> 15:21.400]  It says...
[15:21.400 --> 15:23.360]  That way, it's facing the inside of your car.
[15:23.620 --> 15:24.520]  It's this regular...
[15:24.520 --> 15:24.860]  Oh!
[15:25.440 --> 15:26.320]  That's awesome!
[15:27.400 --> 15:33.980]  I will say, that we have gone through a few iterations of Andrew face balaclavas.
[15:34.680 --> 15:43.760]  And Guvicon, who helped us with the Sloppy Joe's bingo site, actually received one of these.
[15:44.360 --> 15:47.420]  Because these were all test samples of Andrew's face.
[15:47.420 --> 15:50.220]  Oh, it's a nightmare!
[15:50.660 --> 15:54.200]  It looks like the end result of a rip-off Mission Impossible movie.
[15:57.140 --> 15:58.240]  There are different...
[15:58.240 --> 16:02.420]  So you can see that there's different ways of Andrew's face being interpreted here.
[16:02.500 --> 16:04.320]  Where there's like a mouth hole, there's no mouth hole.
[16:04.600 --> 16:06.880]  There's bunched in, there's double layered, whatever.
[16:07.280 --> 16:09.020]  But Guvicon has a one and only...
[16:09.020 --> 16:11.160]  He has one of these that's signed by Geoff.
[16:11.740 --> 16:14.260]  That I asked him not to share, but he can share it now.
[16:14.360 --> 16:16.880]  Because it is fucking insane looking.
[16:16.980 --> 16:19.060]  You know what that picture looks like to me?
[16:19.180 --> 16:22.760]  It looks like Anthony Hopkins laid his clothes out for the day.
[16:22.840 --> 16:25.560]  And he's trying to figure out what he wants to wear in Silence of the Lambs.
[16:25.560 --> 16:30.280]  It's like when the Mrs. Doubtfire mask lands in the street and gets thrown over.
[16:33.500 --> 16:35.940]  It's so bad. I love the fact that...
[16:35.940 --> 16:37.940]  Especially in the first one you posted, Eric.
[16:38.240 --> 16:42.660]  I can't help but notice that the seam, the join, is on the front.
[16:42.940 --> 16:45.560]  It's right in the chin and between the...
[16:45.560 --> 16:46.820]  Why is it on the back?
[16:48.060 --> 16:50.420]  It's so horrendous.
[16:50.700 --> 16:53.580]  I love it. The neck looks awful.
[16:53.580 --> 16:55.940]  It's so fucked.
[16:56.260 --> 16:58.680]  But we will have these on sale on the 25th.
[16:58.760 --> 17:00.140]  Which is just a couple of weeks away.
[17:00.720 --> 17:02.880]  Store.roosterteeth.com is where you can grab them.
[17:02.960 --> 17:04.380]  Or a sunshade for your car.
[17:04.620 --> 17:09.420]  Where it looks like that's how you make a skin for Andrew's face for The Sims 2.
[17:09.840 --> 17:12.480]  And you may be saying to yourself...
[17:12.480 --> 17:15.580]  Why would we make a balaclava of Andrew's face?
[17:15.740 --> 17:16.720]  And I'll tell you right now.
[17:16.820 --> 17:18.460]  Because Gavin gets cold in the winter.
[17:18.640 --> 17:21.160]  And he wants to wear a balaclava around outside.
[17:21.240 --> 17:22.540]  But he doesn't want to look like a criminal.
[17:22.540 --> 17:25.340]  So now he just looks like another dude.
[17:27.760 --> 17:29.020]  That's where this all started.
[17:29.160 --> 17:33.660]  Gavin wanted a nice balaclava that people wouldn't be intimidated by him wearing.
[17:34.100 --> 17:36.540]  So we skinned Andrew's face and we put it on.
[17:39.440 --> 17:43.840]  I also had the idea that potentially if we ever do in-person stuff.
[17:44.180 --> 17:47.080]  Andrew should only appear in his own balaclava mask.
[17:48.740 --> 17:53.220]  Well, the nice thing about it is if you wear it, nobody will think you kick children.
[17:53.300 --> 17:54.800]  So that's just a plus.
[17:55.040 --> 17:57.260]  There will be no accusations of that.
[17:57.880 --> 18:01.160]  So, behind the scenes talk.
[18:01.500 --> 18:07.000]  These have been in the Ecom office since April, maybe?
[18:07.200 --> 18:07.660]  March or April?
[18:07.720 --> 18:08.740]  Yeah, our tests.
[18:10.520 --> 18:14.220]  And Tony and that crew have been wearing them around the building.
[18:15.120 --> 18:17.900]  Off and on for months, scaring the shit out of people.
[18:18.440 --> 18:20.260]  It's become a thing over there.
[18:21.040 --> 18:23.200]  It's the worst thing we've ever made.
[18:23.460 --> 18:24.300]  And therefore my favorite.
[18:25.660 --> 18:27.820]  It's pretty great. I'm really excited.
[18:28.100 --> 18:32.380]  I think having a koozie with your face while wearing your face.
[18:32.720 --> 18:35.660]  I'll be like drinking a soda with your face on the koozie.
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.700]  Sitting in my car wearing your face on my face.
[18:38.880 --> 18:41.720]  While my sunshade with your face is up.
[18:42.140 --> 18:43.360]  And it's pretty exciting.
[18:43.360 --> 18:51.060]  One of my favorite conversations I've had in the history of working for the company.
[18:51.920 --> 18:55.240]  Was the conversation about whether it should have a mouth hole or not.
[18:55.420 --> 18:57.460]  And just like how seriously we took it.
[18:57.660 --> 19:02.380]  Trying on the mask, which is creepy, which is creepier, which is just creepy enough.
[19:03.640 --> 19:10.080]  The audience doesn't know this, but a whole lot of conversation and work and debate went into whether that thing has a mouth hole or not.
[19:10.960 --> 19:12.320]  It's so bad.
[19:14.100 --> 19:15.700]  It's so bad.
[19:16.200 --> 19:18.080]  I will be at the next meeting.
[19:21.920 --> 19:23.120]  Someone's got some notes.
[19:23.720 --> 19:29.940]  I think that, you know, the face RTX break show had all the grown tubes.
[19:30.060 --> 19:32.620]  The next one is going to look like the weirdest cult in the world.
[19:32.880 --> 19:35.140]  It's going to be a meeting of freaks. Can't wait.
[19:35.520 --> 19:39.460]  It's just really like, man, I can't wait for people to have this.
[19:39.460 --> 19:42.980]  And the pictures that we're going to get from people is going to be so exciting.
[19:44.340 --> 19:47.680]  Why in summer are we getting this?
[19:47.720 --> 19:51.700]  So that way you have it for winter and you're used to wearing it all day, every day.
[19:51.820 --> 19:52.620]  And you can stay warm.
[19:52.880 --> 19:53.280]  It's perfect.
[19:54.060 --> 19:58.240]  And if you're in a group that has an evil plan, you don't have to wear mascot outfits.
[19:58.340 --> 19:59.580]  Now you can just all wear these.
[20:03.940 --> 20:05.640]  It's like the beginning of Point Break.
[20:05.640 --> 20:12.040]  Gavin, congratulations, man. You're going to be so toasty warm this winter.
[20:12.280 --> 20:13.620]  I'm going to be so warm.
[20:14.640 --> 20:16.940]  That's great. Thank you for giving that update, Eric.
[20:17.000 --> 20:21.400]  I can't believe we've managed to go this long without Andrew accidentally seeing that.
[20:21.600 --> 20:22.140]  It's pretty cool.
[20:22.580 --> 20:23.160]  What's wrong?
[20:23.520 --> 20:24.200]  How's your juice?
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.020]  I got grape all down my leg.
[20:27.060 --> 20:28.660]  It slid down the handle.
[20:29.860 --> 20:31.100]  Were you wearing the shocks?
[20:32.560 --> 20:33.380]  I'm not.
[20:34.000 --> 20:35.620]  You've got to get your safety shocks on.
[20:36.180 --> 20:37.860]  I've got to get my safety shocks on.
[20:38.880 --> 20:41.580]  I don't know how it happened. It poured down the handle.
[20:41.800 --> 20:45.780]  I put too many grapes in, I guess, and it overflowed and it went down the handle.
[20:45.780 --> 20:46.240]  Oh, the juicer handle?
[20:47.000 --> 20:50.880]  Yeah, it went down the juicer handle, poured down my leg like a fucking spout.
[20:51.580 --> 20:52.480]  Oh my god.
[20:53.840 --> 20:55.480]  Okay, well, I'm going to have a shower after this.
[20:55.720 --> 20:58.940]  I'm sticky already. I'm covered in fucking grape juice.
[20:59.900 --> 21:00.900]  We're getting there.
[21:01.340 --> 21:04.180]  So did you end up putting the grape with the lemon or what?
[21:04.660 --> 21:07.660]  Not yet. I'm juicing my second set of juice.
[21:07.680 --> 21:11.260]  I got the grape watermelon mixed. I'm getting the grape and the lemon.
[21:11.300 --> 21:13.260]  Are you going to juice everything first?
[21:13.740 --> 21:15.840]  Do you want me to or do you want me to just take the shot?
[21:15.920 --> 21:18.280]  I think you should get everything ready and then we'll go down the line.
[21:18.640 --> 21:18.760]  Yeah.
[21:18.980 --> 21:21.720]  Okay. Yeah, so that's what I'm doing. I'm in the process of doing that.
[21:21.880 --> 21:28.540]  I was thinking the other day about the time where I got hit in the face with a piece of tree while I was lying out in the sun and I thought it was Geoff.
[21:29.000 --> 21:35.120]  I was thinking of other times. Have you ever been injured, but you don't know what did it? Just like that moment?
[21:36.020 --> 21:37.940]  Yeah, constantly, like when waking up.
[21:38.040 --> 21:38.960]  Oh, like you get hurt in the night?
[21:39.120 --> 21:43.940]  I've been followed by a gentle ghost for a few years now who's constantly invisibly pushing me into shit.
[21:44.440 --> 21:52.660]  I was once in the woods with a bunch of friends and there was this area where like a bunch of trees next to each other had been cut down and all the stumps were the same height.
[21:53.200 --> 21:55.720]  So I was just lying on my back on all these stumps.
[21:55.720 --> 22:06.320]  And some girl who I had a little bit of a crush on at the time, she just walked over to me and was looking down at me while we're having a conversation.
[22:06.660 --> 22:13.740]  And at one point I shut my eyes and then I got such a impact in my kidneys.
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.840]  I think she kicked me really hard in the kidneys, but it was so painful.
[22:18.840 --> 22:26.620]  I just rolled off the stump and my eyes were shut. And when I looked back around, she was like with other people and I couldn't figure out what happened.
[22:26.740 --> 22:33.020]  And I'm pretty sure someone just, it might've been her, just booted me right in the side really hard.
[22:33.100 --> 22:40.900]  And I almost blacked out, but I still don't know what happened. And I was, I didn't want to go over to everyone and be like, Hey, did someone kick me really hard?
[22:42.800 --> 22:48.320]  So I just like sucked up the pain and I was just quiet for a bit, but I just really don't know what happened.
[22:48.320 --> 22:55.660]  I would love to, if I could see my life from alternate angles, that would be one of the moments. I just, I don't know what happened. Have you ever had that?
[22:56.080 --> 23:01.500]  Not in that way. I think it's hilarious. The idea of like, there's so many unsolved mysteries.
[23:01.860 --> 23:08.800]  And if you had the ability to go back in time and witness what really occurred, yours is what happened to you on the stump?
[23:08.960 --> 23:09.880]  Yeah, you think it was a waste?
[23:09.900 --> 23:17.500]  You avoided all the grief. Yo, an absolute waste. She definitely kicked you in the kidney. You're just going to get confirmation of what you already know.
[23:17.500 --> 23:23.240]  There was also one, there was a different one where I was walking home with one of my friends and sometimes we'd have a little scrap.
[23:23.420 --> 23:32.020]  We'd like try and, uh, like trip each other up and shit. And we're having a scrap. And I, I accidentally like grabbed him and tripped him, but he banged his face on the floor.
[23:32.020 --> 23:38.000]  When we fell over, I was like, Oh, you're right. Cause it was like friendly fighting. And he was like, Oh shit.
[23:38.480 --> 23:46.020]  And, uh, I was like picking up my backpack, which had fallen off. And he was like, you know, in a little bit of pain, he was probably like 10 feet away further up.
[23:46.020 --> 23:54.940]  And then all of a sudden I had a tremendous pain in the side of my knee and it like dropped me like it, you know, when you hit like the side of your knee and your leg just collapses.
[23:55.220 --> 24:00.960]  Yeah. I just went down and I couldn't figure out what happened. I don't know if he threw something or, but he just kept going.
[24:01.140 --> 24:08.160]  And I was just on the floor rolling around for about a minute, just like, Oh, and I could barely stand up. And I would also need to know what happened to me there.
[24:08.360 --> 24:10.980]  Like, did he throw a stone at my knee? I never asked him.
[24:10.980 --> 24:19.160]  Is it at all possible that you are the reason why Geoff has a gentle ghost in his life? That the gentle ghost has been fucking with you for a long time?
[24:19.160 --> 24:19.660]  Oh, and I shook him.
[24:19.660 --> 24:23.860]  Then when you went to America, you shook him off and it picked up on Geoff.
[24:24.040 --> 24:28.300]  You son of a bitch. You little, you little prick.
[24:28.560 --> 24:30.620]  Did you get gentle ghosted before we met?
[24:30.920 --> 24:31.800]  No, never.
[24:32.400 --> 24:38.660]  Because I haven't been hurt since the tree thing. Like I've been hurt, but not by, you know, unknowns.
[24:40.360 --> 24:43.760]  Motherfucker, you, you, that's not cool.
[24:44.200 --> 24:44.640]  I'm sorry.
[24:44.880 --> 24:45.920]  I appreciate it.
[24:45.920 --> 24:51.180]  It's like, it's like it follows. Now I got to figure out how to give the curse to Nick or something.
[24:51.400 --> 24:51.540]  Sorry.
[24:51.600 --> 24:56.660]  I think you have to get hit by something, a piece of tree, and then it transfers to the person you think through it.
[24:56.920 --> 24:57.800]  Oh, there you go.
[24:57.840 --> 25:01.580]  I really like the idea of it follows, but not knowing how to pass it on to the next person.
[25:01.580 --> 25:03.640]  You just have to keep trying things.
[25:04.320 --> 25:06.020]  You have sex with him and it doesn't work.
[25:06.480 --> 25:10.360]  Well, that was a waste of time.
[25:13.560 --> 25:20.250]  Oh, man.
[25:21.030 --> 25:23.670]  Hey, I got a couple of little, like, housecleaning things, if you guys don't mind.
[25:24.610 --> 25:25.370]  I'd love to hear them.
[25:25.370 --> 25:31.690]  One, recently it's come, we've talked about it. I got my Jim's Award achievement after all those years.
[25:32.470 --> 25:32.950]  Congratulations.
[25:32.950 --> 25:33.470]  Thanks.
[25:33.510 --> 25:35.810]  And then I decided to just go ahead and get the rest of the achievements.
[25:36.070 --> 25:39.790]  And like the day I was wrapping it up, they released new achievements, which is fucking annoying.
[25:40.130 --> 25:42.330]  So I have one more to go again.
[25:42.650 --> 25:43.930]  I have one more to go.
[25:43.930 --> 25:44.290]  It gets worse.
[25:45.110 --> 25:45.790]  It gets worse.
[25:46.250 --> 25:47.090]  I have one more to go.
[25:47.430 --> 25:48.110]  It's called fuck you, Geoff.
[25:48.110 --> 25:49.130]  No, I have one more.
[25:49.470 --> 25:52.390]  It's not related to me in any way, but it's I have one more to get.
[25:52.750 --> 25:53.930]  That's going to take me a couple months.
[25:54.490 --> 26:03.310]  But then, you know, I got DM'd by somebody at the Jim's Award company, and they were like congratulating me on getting the achievement.
[26:03.450 --> 26:05.210]  They were like, hey, we're glad you finally got it.
[26:05.330 --> 26:08.870]  I think they were like, probably like, it took you fucking long enough, you know, but they were polite about it.
[26:09.570 --> 26:14.690]  And then they go, you know, we've been kicking around ideas in the office, and I think we might have another achievement coming, headed your way.
[26:15.050 --> 26:16.130]  And I was like, God damn it.
[26:16.430 --> 26:20.970]  So I guess there may be a fuck you, Geoff, coming.
[26:22.250 --> 26:25.130]  Do you think it'll be like a lifetime one? It'll be like ten times the amount?
[26:25.430 --> 26:28.110]  I don't know. I don't know that I have it in me, honestly.
[26:28.490 --> 26:34.450]  Like, I'm I'm I don't I don't think I'm on my back nine yet, but I'm pretty close.
[26:34.670 --> 26:39.970]  You know, like at some point you got to you got to look at how much life you have left and determine where you want to spend it.
[26:41.570 --> 26:44.590]  The funniest part is your opinion on this doesn't matter.
[26:44.610 --> 26:49.150]  But what will happen is you'll enrage an entire community of Jim's Award players.
[26:49.150 --> 26:54.270]  Yeah. And you have no say in the matter, but people are going to be so pissed when another insane achievement gets added.
[26:54.450 --> 26:58.130]  And if it had my name on it, I don't know that it'd be any way I could physically not get it.
[26:58.230 --> 27:01.490]  You know, yeah, it feels like a feels like a requirement.
[27:02.390 --> 27:08.290]  Another thing is, you know, those Allen and Ginter baseball cards that we open up sometimes that they have, like, that's where the egg was.
[27:08.310 --> 27:09.810]  Remember the egg that I got you, Geoff?
[27:10.110 --> 27:11.030]  This is a baseball card of an egg.
[27:11.330 --> 27:13.410]  Yes. And they have like sandwiches and stuff.
[27:13.930 --> 27:18.330]  Well, the new cards are coming out in a couple of weeks and they haven't released the full card list.
[27:18.330 --> 27:21.790]  So I don't know, but they have released like what the different inserts and stuff are.
[27:22.090 --> 27:24.750]  And they have one called Talon Ted.
[27:25.170 --> 27:29.710]  And it says it's a bird based insert focusing on formidable claws.
[27:30.090 --> 27:35.170]  So I think there's a really good chance there might be a Falcon card about to hit the market.
[27:35.570 --> 27:37.190]  So we should keep our eyes open for that.
[27:37.590 --> 27:39.490]  And one other little thing.
[27:40.350 --> 27:41.930]  Yeah, we can open on the break show if I can get him.
[27:42.350 --> 27:43.830]  Do you remember the Hamburglar?
[27:44.350 --> 27:46.330]  We had that conversation about the Hamburglar.
[27:46.350 --> 27:47.750]  Yeah. Oh, yeah. That guy. Grady Dick.
[27:48.590 --> 27:52.710]  I got a Grady Dick baseball card or basketball card I have to share with you guys.
[27:52.770 --> 27:53.470]  It's so funny.
[27:54.170 --> 27:54.930]  Oh, I see it.
[27:54.970 --> 27:56.050]  I really want you guys to see it.
[27:56.150 --> 27:56.770]  Let me...
[27:56.770 --> 28:01.230]  Anyway, the break shows on 4 p.m. on Mondays on Rooster Teeth and our YouTube channel.
[28:01.410 --> 28:06.630]  And then you can watch the VOD, the recorded show later while Geoff is looking for this thing.
[28:07.590 --> 28:09.550]  Yeah, I figured that might be a good place to plug it.
[28:09.630 --> 28:10.990]  Since you were talking about cards.
[28:11.410 --> 28:12.250]  Cut all this out.
[28:12.470 --> 28:13.290]  All right, here we go.
[28:13.330 --> 28:14.010]  Great. Thanks, man.
[28:17.310 --> 28:18.410]  Here you go.
[28:18.550 --> 28:20.010]  Look at this fucking card.
[28:20.210 --> 28:23.150]  If for the audience, he's wearing...
[28:25.370 --> 28:26.670]  It's Grady Dick.
[28:26.950 --> 28:29.590]  He looks like the little kid from Soul Plane.
[28:29.770 --> 28:30.050]  Yeah.
[28:30.250 --> 28:31.550]  A lot of people are saying...
[28:31.550 --> 28:36.250]  I know you guys don't watch the show, but a lot of people are saying he looks like BJ on Righteous Gemstones.
[28:37.090 --> 28:40.530]  It looks like what he would look like if the burglary went well.
[28:42.330 --> 28:43.730]  Anyway, you can check it out on the Instagram.
[28:43.730 --> 28:49.750]  It's like a Tops Now card they released, but it's his outfit on draft night.
[28:50.110 --> 28:51.010]  He's wearing black sunglasses.
[28:51.450 --> 28:53.830]  Actually, Andrew, you nailed it with Soulmant.
[28:54.610 --> 28:56.070]  I think it's exactly what it looks like.
[28:56.290 --> 29:00.510]  And he's wearing this red suit that looks like it's made out of sparkle.
[29:01.650 --> 29:02.490]  Yeah, there you go.
[29:02.910 --> 29:03.450]  There's BJ.
[29:04.210 --> 29:05.610]  He looks like Ruby Rod.
[29:05.990 --> 29:06.690]  I don't know who that is.
[29:06.990 --> 29:07.890]  Who is Ruby Rod?
[29:08.270 --> 29:09.790]  It's Chris Tucker in Fifth Element.
[29:12.110 --> 29:12.830]  Oh, yeah.
[29:13.710 --> 29:14.650]  Yeah, I could see that.
[29:14.750 --> 29:15.590]  That's a great card.
[29:15.910 --> 29:16.190]  Thanks.
[29:16.350 --> 29:17.490]  Are you going to get that card graded?
[29:17.530 --> 29:19.470]  Are you going to try to get a 10 gem mint of that?
[29:19.950 --> 29:20.650]  Yeah, maybe.
[29:20.770 --> 29:21.730]  I'll see if I can get it graded.

[32:17.600 --> 32:25.900]  There are a lot of times in life where you are faced with a decision that might not have an easy or clear answer.
[32:26.460 --> 32:31.520]  And it's really tough to navigate those moments. I mean, for me, they pop up quite a bit, especially when I was growing up.
[32:32.860 --> 32:40.060]  I have found sometimes you just have to go with something and understand that maybe it won't go the way you hoped and view that as a learning experience.
[32:40.060 --> 32:49.100]  But it's always great to consult with someone as well who has a level of expertise that you may not have or even just some insight or perspective you don't.
[32:49.800 --> 32:53.280]  Sometimes in life we're faced with tough choices and the path forward isn't always clear.
[32:53.560 --> 33:00.780]  Whether you're dealing with decisions around career, relationships, or anything else, therapy helps you stay connected to what you really want while you navigate life.
[33:01.080 --> 33:03.460]  So you can move forward with confidence and excitement.
[33:04.140 --> 33:07.160]  Trusting yourself to make decisions that align with your values is like anything.
[33:07.160 --> 33:09.320]  The more you practice it, the easier it gets.
[33:10.120 --> 33:14.000]  Therapy is a wonderful experience to go through in my experience.
[33:14.340 --> 33:17.100]  A little redundant, but to say that.
[33:17.220 --> 33:26.340]  However, it's just super impactful. It has made so many positive impacts on my life and it's just such a healthy process to go through, in my opinion.
[33:26.480 --> 33:28.400]  So I'd highly recommend anyone try it.
[33:28.980 --> 33:31.920]  So if you're thinking of starting therapy, give BetterHelp a try.

[33:55.580 --> 33:58.360]  I have a CPAP update.
[33:58.940 --> 33:59.380]  Oh!
[33:59.820 --> 34:01.940]  Oh, you're farting nonstop, right?
[34:01.940 --> 34:03.880]  It still does that.
[34:04.160 --> 34:06.100]  So I'm sort of trying to use it and try a different shit.
[34:06.400 --> 34:09.960]  I tried having the CPAP up my nose and taping my mouth shut.
[34:10.340 --> 34:11.020]  Still fill me with air.
[34:11.180 --> 34:12.980]  Then I just tried the mouth tape alone.
[34:13.340 --> 34:16.920]  I tried it the night before last, taping my mouth shut.
[34:17.560 --> 34:20.720]  And then coincidentally, at the same time, food poisoning.
[34:21.620 --> 34:22.500]  Oh, no.
[34:22.880 --> 34:26.800]  Now the mouth tape has a little sort of, I think, an emergency breathing hole.
[34:27.060 --> 34:28.960]  It was a pressure hose.
[34:29.880 --> 34:31.600]  I threw up in the night.
[34:32.320 --> 34:35.720]  And it came out jetting through that slit.
[34:36.100 --> 34:39.160]  Which caused some sort of backflow through my sinuses.
[34:39.740 --> 34:40.540]  Shot out my nose.
[34:40.760 --> 34:42.660]  And it was just all bile.
[34:43.020 --> 34:46.960]  It made my whole head spicy and tingly.
[34:47.360 --> 34:48.980]  It was probably the worst experience.
[34:49.480 --> 34:51.980]  And then after that, I just shat myself for about 24 hours.
[34:52.080 --> 34:53.040]  Just shitting liquid again.
[34:53.540 --> 34:53.960]  Awful.
[34:54.380 --> 34:56.840]  Probably the worst combination of things to happen at the same time.
[34:57.940 --> 34:58.380]  So...
[34:58.380 --> 35:02.700]  The second time I tried taping my mouth shut, I threw up through it.
[35:02.840 --> 35:03.240]  Let's...
[35:03.240 --> 35:05.560]  Oh, my God. That's so gross.
[35:05.700 --> 35:06.840]  Let's go through this step by step.
[35:07.220 --> 35:09.500]  So, you went to bed normal. You felt fine.
[35:10.060 --> 35:10.220]  Yeah.
[35:10.780 --> 35:12.760]  And you put that thing on your mouth.
[35:13.320 --> 35:13.500]  Yep.
[35:14.220 --> 35:16.740]  And then in the middle of the night, you woke up nauseous.
[35:17.160 --> 35:18.220]  I woke up throwing up.
[35:18.640 --> 35:20.860]  So you woke up in the act of throwing up.
[35:20.900 --> 35:21.200]  Oh, no.
[35:21.560 --> 35:23.240]  I woke up with my...
[35:23.240 --> 35:26.620]  It honestly felt like I woke up with someone's fist in my mouth.
[35:27.360 --> 35:28.560]  Oh, my God.
[35:28.860 --> 35:32.840]  Did you throw up all over your bed and all your sheets and stuff?
[35:33.160 --> 35:34.200]  Yep. And a bit of the wall.
[35:34.560 --> 35:35.100]  Oh, my God.
[35:35.100 --> 35:39.660]  It just shot out. It, like, blew through that, blew out of my nose, and then blew out...
[35:39.660 --> 35:40.840]  And then, like, kind of blew the tape off.
[35:40.900 --> 35:41.940]  Because it was forceful.
[35:43.000 --> 35:43.720]  It's like...
[35:44.160 --> 35:45.860]  So, like, in The Exorcist, kind of.
[35:46.320 --> 35:46.520]  Yeah.
[35:46.980 --> 35:48.540]  I wouldn't wish that on anyone.
[35:48.960 --> 35:56.300]  And to get the feeling out of my face, to get it to, like, stop being all, like, stomach acid-y.
[35:56.720 --> 35:56.880]  Yeah.
[35:57.040 --> 35:58.120]  It took, like, over a day.
[35:58.580 --> 36:02.980]  Yeah, once that gets up in your nostrils and shit, it's, like, it's there for a while.
[36:03.340 --> 36:03.940]  It, like, burns.
[36:03.960 --> 36:06.180]  Are you done with taping your mouth, or is that...
[36:06.180 --> 36:06.680]  Yeah, forever.
[36:06.780 --> 36:07.420]  Are you gonna...
[36:07.420 --> 36:08.980]  Yeah, you can't...
[36:08.980 --> 36:09.600]  You can't...
[36:09.600 --> 36:10.800]  That's not viable anymore.
[36:11.960 --> 36:12.660]  Oh, my God.
[36:12.680 --> 36:13.920]  I'm so sorry that happened to you.
[36:13.920 --> 36:14.540]  That's terrible.
[36:15.000 --> 36:15.240]  Yeah.
[36:15.680 --> 36:16.820]  What are the odds?
[36:17.280 --> 36:17.820]  What are the odds?
[36:17.820 --> 36:19.200]  Do you feel different as a human?
[36:19.680 --> 36:21.260]  Like, has this experience changed you?
[36:21.460 --> 36:23.480]  I would be disturbed by this.
[36:23.580 --> 36:25.260]  Do you think this was your Vietnam?
[36:26.840 --> 36:30.700]  Well, it means that, basically, any time I throw up after this, it's never gonna be that worse.
[36:31.760 --> 36:32.620]  That's a great point.
[36:32.660 --> 36:33.280]  Well, you'd hope.
[36:34.580 --> 36:35.840]  I'm trying to think of, like...
[36:35.840 --> 36:36.180]  I don't know why.
[36:36.260 --> 36:37.780]  I don't know if I tempt fate like that.
[36:38.080 --> 36:43.200]  Yeah, not to get too gross, but I'm imagining, like, you're snorkeling, and you puked in a snorkel.
[36:43.320 --> 36:44.200]  That'd be pretty bad.
[36:44.460 --> 36:44.820]  Yeah.
[36:46.500 --> 36:48.020]  Outside of that...
[36:48.020 --> 36:53.300]  From the surface of the water, just a load of food come flying out.
[36:53.620 --> 36:56.440]  Like, a whale blowhole, but it's vomit.
[36:57.480 --> 37:00.400]  And then a shark would probably eat you.
[37:00.740 --> 37:00.920]  Yeah.
[37:03.980 --> 37:05.600]  So, let's talk about the shitting.
[37:06.600 --> 37:07.580]  What was that like?
[37:07.580 --> 37:08.160]  How was that?
[37:08.840 --> 37:09.660]  It was bad.
[37:09.780 --> 37:12.360]  I was holding my ass closed again, because it was just in that...
[37:12.360 --> 37:13.920]  You know, it's in that water phase.
[37:14.100 --> 37:14.400]  Yeah.
[37:14.400 --> 37:17.700]  If you're not actively closing your ass, something could leak out.
[37:17.980 --> 37:20.580]  Something that feels like a fart, or even just a bubble, could be liquid.
[37:21.180 --> 37:26.860]  I sat through all of Always Open yesterday, just with my hands pressing my bumcheeks closed.
[37:28.280 --> 37:33.940]  How does it compare to when you were dating Meg that time, and you shit on the plane seven times?
[37:34.160 --> 37:37.920]  It was maybe 80% of the way towards that.
[37:38.160 --> 37:40.180]  But that was even more uncontrollable.
[37:41.200 --> 37:46.420]  That was the point where any time I lost consciousness, my underwear would be soaking wet.
[37:46.560 --> 37:48.060]  Oh my god.
[37:48.520 --> 37:49.440]  With just bum water.
[37:49.940 --> 37:52.280]  I need to drink stuff later, okay?
[37:52.440 --> 37:52.680]  Sorry.
[37:52.680 --> 37:53.560]  Can we calm down?
[37:56.680 --> 37:58.660]  One last question, and then I'm off of it.
[38:01.100 --> 38:03.560]  What do you think gave you food poisoning? Do you have any idea?
[38:03.980 --> 38:05.460]  I mean, I could name the establishment.
[38:06.820 --> 38:07.940]  Yeah, please do.
[38:08.060 --> 38:08.860]  So he has an idea.
[38:09.360 --> 38:12.860]  A lovely place, a little underground place called ******.
[38:14.300 --> 38:18.940]  I had to get this. I had the poo-poo platter, and it was not good.
[38:20.600 --> 38:22.000]  That's sort of on you.
[38:22.120 --> 38:22.740]  That's on me.
[38:23.560 --> 38:28.060]  I will say, the food was good. The experience afterwards was not good.
[38:28.140 --> 38:33.700]  And maybe, even more annoyingly, the person I was with, absolutely fine. And we shared it.
[38:34.960 --> 38:40.680]  Sod knows what one single piece of bad meat I ate. But that is always the icing on the cake.
[38:40.780 --> 38:45.540]  Is that the place that's behind the place and underground, and it's all pirate-themed?
[38:45.980 --> 38:51.960]  Yeah, and if you spend $99 on a shared drink, you get a light show and explosions and stuff.
[38:51.960 --> 38:52.220]  Yes.
[38:52.660 --> 38:54.980]  We didn't do that, but we saw another table get it.
[38:54.980 --> 38:59.100]  I went there with Emily and some friends, and let me tell you, that's a place that...
[39:01.720 --> 39:04.680]  Not the coolest place to hang out if you don't drink anymore.
[39:05.860 --> 39:15.740]  It's kind of all centered around celebrating, drinking together in colorful ways.
[39:16.040 --> 39:19.440]  Yeah, and sharing. One drink, four straws sort of situation.
[39:19.620 --> 39:23.300]  There was one drink that had... I think it was made of 13 different rums.
[39:23.460 --> 39:23.940]  Yeah.
[39:24.680 --> 39:25.540]  Didn't go for that.
[39:25.660 --> 39:26.060]  Wow.
[39:26.220 --> 39:32.100]  But yeah, it was a nice place, good atmosphere, lovely staff, delicious food, terrible aftermath.
[39:32.280 --> 39:33.800]  Do you think you'll go back?
[39:34.980 --> 39:37.120]  Oh, not for a bit. I'll give it a year, maybe.
[39:38.900 --> 39:39.960]  Was that your first time there?
[39:40.600 --> 39:40.820]  Yeah.
[39:41.760 --> 39:42.560]  Oh, no.
[39:43.980 --> 39:46.440]  I thought I had a bad sleep with the sleep spaghetti.
[39:46.440 --> 39:51.540]  I will say, a point I forgot to bring up, I did fall asleep at the bottom of the pile,
[39:51.980 --> 39:55.720]  and then I had an itchy face, and it was alarming trying to get to my face.
[39:56.020 --> 39:57.180]  It was not a good experience.
[39:57.660 --> 40:01.740]  Like, I just went for a quick scratch, and then I had to go through an obstacle course of noodle.
[40:02.460 --> 40:03.160]  It was not fun.
[40:04.600 --> 40:06.720]  Another negative about the sleep spaghetti experience.
[40:07.040 --> 40:08.780]  I have a question for you, Geoff.
[40:08.920 --> 40:09.160]  Okay.
[40:09.240 --> 40:13.340]  I've run this by Gavin, as we're talking about butt stuff.
[40:14.140 --> 40:15.040]  I had a thought.
[40:15.040 --> 40:16.040]  Okay.
[40:16.420 --> 40:24.360]  When do you think, how long did it take from the point in which fire was discovered, like created,
[40:24.460 --> 40:29.820]  the first fire was made, to the point that we realized farts were flammable?
[40:30.160 --> 40:31.020]  How long was that?
[40:31.460 --> 40:33.280]  Do you think that was an immediate realization?
[40:33.860 --> 40:35.300]  Do you think that took some time?
[40:35.660 --> 40:38.760]  What is the context of the first flammable fart?
[40:39.040 --> 40:40.000]  Here's a question.
[40:40.540 --> 40:42.020]  Do you think...
[40:42.020 --> 40:47.640]  So, do you think it predates humans or, I guess,
[40:50.300 --> 40:51.100]  electromagnet or whatever,
[40:52.420 --> 40:54.040]  wherever we were evolutionary at the time,
[40:54.360 --> 41:00.180]  do you think it predates when human entities learned how to create fire?
[41:00.520 --> 41:03.240]  Because, you know, like, lightning would strike and a tree would catch on fire and there would be fire.
[41:03.460 --> 41:07.820]  Like, do you think anybody ever, like, saw a tree on fire from a lightning strike
[41:08.580 --> 41:10.300]  and then ran up and farted on it?
[41:11.960 --> 41:14.180]  Or do you think, like, we had to learn...
[41:14.180 --> 41:17.500]  Do you think humans had to learn how to create and then control fire
[41:17.500 --> 41:21.000]  before they then learned to start doing things like farting on it?
[41:21.400 --> 41:26.620]  Yeah, I think probably they would have had to have created it first, would be my assumption.
[41:26.760 --> 41:27.560]  Yeah, I think so too.
[41:27.740 --> 41:33.400]  I would assume that the first fire fart was accidental on the day the first bonfire was made.
[41:34.440 --> 41:36.860]  You think it's the first... I think it would have taken a while.
[41:36.860 --> 41:38.060]  I don't think it would be immediate.
[41:39.420 --> 41:41.160]  Uh, well, now, hold on a second.
[41:41.440 --> 41:46.280]  How many times a day do you fart?
[41:47.920 --> 41:50.860]  Yeah, 13 to 21 times a day the average humans fart.
[41:51.080 --> 41:55.000]  So, if you figure you've got your first fire and there's probably everybody, like,
[41:55.100 --> 41:57.160]  everybody in the cave is excited about it, right?
[41:57.240 --> 41:58.700]  Like, it's like the talk of the town.
[41:59.100 --> 42:03.000]  So you probably got like 18 or 20 Neanderthals all crowding around
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.960]  and they don't have social graces at all.
[42:05.960 --> 42:08.180]  And they probably, they're pretty dumb, right?
[42:09.220 --> 42:10.620]  Evolutionary brain size.
[42:10.740 --> 42:13.500]  So they're into stupid sophomoric potty humor.
[42:14.100 --> 42:19.420]  I bet farts happen so frequently that it could have happened on day one.
[42:19.980 --> 42:24.700]  Do you think they made a fire inside their cave and everyone died of carbon monoxide?
[42:25.860 --> 42:27.620]  Yes, I also think...
[42:27.620 --> 42:28.240]  It must have happened somewhere.
[42:28.520 --> 42:31.160]  Yes, or like one person crawled out and was like,
[42:31.420 --> 42:35.620]  and put two and two together and realized to make the fire closer to the mouth of the cave.
[42:35.620 --> 42:36.120]  Yeah.
[42:38.260 --> 42:40.400]  I mean, that's how you learn, right? Trial and error.
[42:41.480 --> 42:43.960]  A plausible scenario for when it would have happened
[42:43.960 --> 42:47.140]  is somebody trying to put out the fire in a funny way.
[42:47.620 --> 42:49.960]  Like I could see somebody thinking that like,
[42:50.020 --> 42:52.540]  Oh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go do this and everyone will laugh.
[42:52.600 --> 42:54.780]  And then they would get a surprise when they realize...
[42:55.580 --> 42:56.960]  Oh, like blowing out a birthday candle?
[42:57.640 --> 42:59.160]  Yeah, exactly. But with your ass.
[42:59.160 --> 43:01.540]  And then the fire came back and nipped them.
[43:02.020 --> 43:04.280]  But then I wondered if that did happen,
[43:04.280 --> 43:06.500]  there would have to be a question of,
[43:06.960 --> 43:10.140]  is Steve's farts flammable and only Steve's?
[43:10.160 --> 43:13.300]  Or is everybody, do we all got flammable farts?
[43:13.640 --> 43:15.980]  Can we weaponize this in some way?
[43:16.240 --> 43:17.900]  Potentially, if we're shooting out fire?
[43:18.320 --> 43:21.080]  Like what, what are the different angles, I wonder,
[43:21.340 --> 43:23.420]  that were approached upon discovery?
[43:23.560 --> 43:25.240]  I was thinking of it from a different angle.
[43:25.480 --> 43:27.700]  Like, let's say you're the first person who figures out
[43:27.700 --> 43:31.580]  that you can fart into a fire and, you know,
[43:31.600 --> 43:33.560]  make a stream, make a little blowtorch.
[43:33.560 --> 43:36.960]  Does that change the balance of power in the cave?
[43:37.640 --> 43:39.920]  Like, are you now elevated as like,
[43:40.020 --> 43:41.600]  like if you were just like an average Joe,
[43:41.720 --> 43:43.100]  are you now like the chief?
[43:43.400 --> 43:45.640]  Like it's like the lion having the biggest mane.
[43:46.200 --> 43:47.900]  Yeah, exactly. Exactly like that.
[43:47.960 --> 43:49.660]  You've now demonstrated your like,
[43:49.680 --> 43:52.940]  your dominance in some way over, over fire,
[43:53.140 --> 43:53.860]  over the elements.
[43:53.860 --> 43:56.600]  Like, do you suddenly get elevated to like chieftain?
[43:57.040 --> 44:01.120]  I think it depends on your reaction to the stream touching you.
[44:01.300 --> 44:03.080]  I think that goes one of two ways.
[44:03.080 --> 44:06.200]  You either are at the top of the pyramid after that,
[44:06.280 --> 44:07.900]  or the absolute bottom.
[44:08.220 --> 44:10.040]  You get ranked down if you,
[44:10.040 --> 44:11.500]  if you like scream or whatever.
[44:12.660 --> 44:14.180]  If it really bites you.
[44:14.460 --> 44:16.900]  Do you think anybody, like back in those days,
[44:17.220 --> 44:19.580]  if anybody had like a particularly bad fart
[44:19.580 --> 44:21.160]  and like really gassed a place out,
[44:21.360 --> 44:23.260]  do you think people ever got killed for that?
[44:23.840 --> 44:24.660]  Like for being a witch?
[44:25.120 --> 44:27.220]  Yeah, like, like your farts were so bad,
[44:27.400 --> 44:30.160]  it like it bummed or scared the rest of the,
[44:30.160 --> 44:31.300]  the, the cave crew.
[44:31.300 --> 44:33.720]  I think honestly,
[44:33.760 --> 44:35.360]  you would have been killed for some of yours.
[44:36.860 --> 44:37.920]  You're trying to argue.
[44:38.080 --> 44:40.440]  It's just the acoustics of the cave where you sleep.
[44:43.260 --> 44:45.380]  Well, did you tell them Andrew what you were trying,
[44:45.500 --> 44:46.240]  what you were going to do?
[44:47.060 --> 44:48.100]  Well, that was okay.
[44:48.180 --> 44:49.860]  So the follow up is if the idea,
[44:50.180 --> 44:51.800]  my thought was, okay,
[44:52.100 --> 44:54.060]  you can shoot fire out of your ass.
[44:54.460 --> 44:55.840]  Maybe we can weaponize this.
[44:56.060 --> 45:01.080]  I wondered if someone were to fart a bunch of times
[45:01.080 --> 45:03.940]  into like a jar and then tie to,
[45:04.560 --> 45:07.960]  sealed it up and then put like a cloth around the top
[45:07.960 --> 45:08.820]  with a sealed lid,
[45:09.220 --> 45:10.680]  lit the thing on fire.
[45:10.920 --> 45:13.860]  Could you make a Molotov cocktail out of gas?
[45:14.360 --> 45:15.400]  Just by far.
[45:15.800 --> 45:17.280]  But I would say the whole point of the rag
[45:17.280 --> 45:18.620]  is that it likes you,
[45:18.860 --> 45:19.980]  it gets some of the liquid on it.
[45:20.000 --> 45:21.260]  So it's easy to light.
[45:21.360 --> 45:21.860]  I don't know what,
[45:22.220 --> 45:23.660]  what's the rag going to be doing?
[45:24.600 --> 45:25.900]  What's the source of the fire?
[45:26.040 --> 45:27.360]  So you light the rag,
[45:27.440 --> 45:28.220]  you've got fire,
[45:28.300 --> 45:29.080]  you throw it,
[45:29.180 --> 45:30.120]  the jar breaks,
[45:30.120 --> 45:31.260]  the gas releases,
[45:31.760 --> 45:32.940]  and a little fireball comes out.
[45:33.660 --> 45:36.500]  I don't think there's enough gas in a fart
[45:36.500 --> 45:38.080]  to have that amount of pressure.
[45:38.220 --> 45:39.220]  But what about several?
[45:39.400 --> 45:41.080]  What if it was like a day's worth?
[45:41.220 --> 45:41.780]  Well, the trouble is,
[45:41.820 --> 45:43.620]  every time you go for a new fart in there,
[45:43.700 --> 45:44.100]  you're releasing,
[45:44.260 --> 45:45.820]  there's no way you're going to get a good seal.
[45:46.220 --> 45:46.780]  Or like a,
[45:47.120 --> 45:49.180]  you need a valve or something on your anus.
[45:49.940 --> 45:51.820]  It would have to be pretty specialized equipment.
[45:52.040 --> 45:54.180]  I feel like it would have to be attached to your anus
[45:54.180 --> 45:55.040]  and there would have to be,
[45:55.300 --> 45:56.520]  it has to be fed in,
[45:56.580 --> 45:58.400]  there has to be a nozzle fed into your anus
[45:58.400 --> 46:00.900]  with like a on-off valve
[46:00.900 --> 46:01.500]  that you can,
[46:01.920 --> 46:02.320]  you know what I mean?
[46:02.340 --> 46:03.220]  That you can turn on
[46:03.220 --> 46:05.440]  just so there's no possibility of escape.
[46:05.720 --> 46:06.200]  I bet you could do it.
[46:06.200 --> 46:07.020]  I was thinking it would have like
[46:07.020 --> 46:08.680]  one of those beaker corks
[46:08.680 --> 46:10.020]  with the straws going through it
[46:10.020 --> 46:11.980]  with like a non-return valve at the end.
[46:12.180 --> 46:13.680]  That's the only way you're keeping stuff in.
[46:14.180 --> 46:14.460]  Yeah.
[46:14.640 --> 46:15.000]  But if,
[46:15.580 --> 46:16.820]  okay, let's just say that
[46:16.820 --> 46:18.680]  that is all a thing that happens.
[46:18.760 --> 46:20.620]  That like we do find a way to do this
[46:20.620 --> 46:21.440]  and you can store them.
[46:21.620 --> 46:23.580]  Like all the mechanisms of getting it
[46:23.580 --> 46:24.800]  are figured out.
[46:25.060 --> 46:26.240]  Do you think it would work?
[46:26.600 --> 46:28.100]  Like if you could do that?
[46:28.500 --> 46:30.480]  Does the science even work for that?
[46:30.780 --> 46:31.260]  Is what I wonder.
[46:31.500 --> 46:31.600]  Yes.
[46:31.620 --> 46:32.840]  Like if you could solve the other stuff,
[46:32.900 --> 46:34.600]  I wonder if the science itself works.
[46:34.920 --> 46:35.820]  What a fireball.
[46:36.160 --> 46:37.020]  Does it like,
[46:37.400 --> 46:38.700]  because it's like methane
[46:39.600 --> 46:40.660]  from your ass, right?
[46:40.720 --> 46:41.860]  But then do you need oxygen?
[46:42.020 --> 46:43.300]  Like does it only work in a
[46:43.300 --> 46:45.040]  oxygen-rich environment too?
[46:45.280 --> 46:46.280]  Like do you also need to be pumping
[46:46.280 --> 46:47.600]  other gases in there with it?
[46:47.840 --> 46:48.660]  I don't know.
[46:49.240 --> 46:50.080]  Yeah, I don't know.
[46:50.280 --> 46:51.220]  I don't have the answer to that.
[46:51.280 --> 46:51.780]  I'm just curious.
[46:52.140 --> 46:52.720]  No, I think it's,
[46:52.940 --> 46:54.900]  I think as soon as you throw it
[46:54.900 --> 46:56.160]  with the fire
[46:56.160 --> 46:58.080]  and then it explodes,
[46:58.300 --> 47:00.480]  the oxygen rushes in
[47:00.480 --> 47:02.020]  and that's your oxygen-rich environment.
[47:02.240 --> 47:03.620]  And then I bet you could make a,
[47:03.840 --> 47:05.080]  I mean, I don't think you're going to like,
[47:05.580 --> 47:06.120]  I don't know.
[47:06.120 --> 47:07.420]  I wouldn't try to overthrow
[47:07.420 --> 47:09.120]  a small government with it.
[47:10.420 --> 47:11.140]  I think,
[47:11.260 --> 47:12.560]  I think you could probably have
[47:12.560 --> 47:13.160]  some sort of a,
[47:13.160 --> 47:14.500]  some sort of a reaction.
[47:14.900 --> 47:16.000]  How about this?
[47:16.280 --> 47:18.160]  Do you think anybody has ever lit
[47:18.160 --> 47:20.380]  a Molotov cocktail out of their ass
[47:20.380 --> 47:21.540]  just by like,
[47:21.580 --> 47:22.720]  not filled it with gas,
[47:22.740 --> 47:24.360]  but just like had a regular Molotov cocktail
[47:24.360 --> 47:26.440]  and then used their ass as like a flamethrower
[47:26.440 --> 47:27.580]  just to light it?
[47:29.740 --> 47:31.680]  What a way to start a revolution.
[47:32.220 --> 47:33.780]  If you really want to make an entrance.
[47:34.400 --> 47:34.600]  Yeah.
[47:34.700 --> 47:36.000]  I don't think it's been done before.
[47:36.480 --> 47:37.920]  It's something to think about.
[47:37.940 --> 47:38.040]  I at least have not seen it.
[47:38.460 --> 47:39.020]  You could be,
[47:39.600 --> 47:40.000]  dude,
[47:40.920 --> 47:41.300]  you'd be,
[47:41.360 --> 47:42.460]  you could be the next Che Guevara.
[47:42.660 --> 47:43.840]  People would be wearing your T-shirts
[47:43.840 --> 47:45.160]  for the next 150 years.
[47:45.540 --> 47:46.080]  If you,
[47:46.160 --> 47:47.600]  if you figure out how to light pot,
[47:47.720 --> 47:48.440]  if you light,
[47:48.640 --> 47:49.100]  start a,
[47:49.200 --> 47:50.760]  light a revolution with only your asshole.
[47:52.220 --> 47:54.480]  Light a revolution is such a great name
[47:54.480 --> 47:57.080]  for the true story behind this person.
[47:57.200 --> 47:57.980]  So are you going to,
[47:57.980 --> 47:58.860]  are you going to attempt this?
[47:59.200 --> 48:01.600]  I don't know if I have the equipment to do it,
[48:01.640 --> 48:02.960]  but I'm very curious about it.
[48:03.020 --> 48:03.240]  If so,
[48:03.260 --> 48:05.300]  I'm sure somebody out there is smart,
[48:05.580 --> 48:08.840]  smarter than us and no science in a way that could break.
[48:09.000 --> 48:09.580]  Eric has doubts.
[48:09.640 --> 48:11.740]  He says he can't even juice this fruit.
[48:11.740 --> 48:12.940]  No, the fruits juiced.
[48:13.180 --> 48:14.800]  It is all good to go.
[48:14.880 --> 48:15.220]  Okay.
[48:15.320 --> 48:19.040]  I will say I did realize that I forgot to buy bananas.
[48:19.040 --> 48:20.060]  So I'm gonna,
[48:20.240 --> 48:22.240]  the next time we'll do the banana one,
[48:22.300 --> 48:23.400]  but I got the two of the three.
[48:24.140 --> 48:25.140]  I'm just staring down.
[48:25.380 --> 48:26.720]  I'm kind of scared to drink it.
[48:26.780 --> 48:28.700]  I think we'll wait until near the end of the show
[48:28.700 --> 48:30.120]  because I don't know what the reaction will be.
[48:30.240 --> 48:30.920]  What'd you guys,
[48:30.980 --> 48:32.420]  what'd you guys do while I was out of town?
[48:32.620 --> 48:33.340]  I had a realization.
[48:33.960 --> 48:36.220]  So I've been writing stuff down because,
[48:36.320 --> 48:36.460]  you know,
[48:36.520 --> 48:39.260]  like I didn't know the caps lock key and all that stuff.
[48:39.380 --> 48:40.900]  So whenever I have a question,
[48:41.020 --> 48:44.440]  I've started writing it down or like a realization just to have.
[48:45.160 --> 48:45.880]  I realized,
[48:46.220 --> 48:48.660]  and this might be something that's very obvious to everyone else.
[48:48.660 --> 48:52.140]  That we go through five seasons every year.
[48:52.520 --> 48:54.000]  I had never thought about that.
[48:54.240 --> 48:54.460]  Hmm.
[48:55.000 --> 48:56.300]  It's a five season year.
[48:56.460 --> 48:58.360]  We go through five seasons a year?
[48:58.740 --> 49:02.600]  Every year has five seasons that you go through.
[49:03.020 --> 49:03.280]  Okay.
[49:03.300 --> 49:04.120]  Because you start...
[49:04.120 --> 49:04.960]  Because you go through winter twice?
[49:05.500 --> 49:05.640]  You,
[49:05.780 --> 49:06.100]  yeah,
[49:06.220 --> 49:08.480]  you have two different winters every year.
[49:09.600 --> 49:11.000]  I never thought about that.
[49:11.320 --> 49:12.320]  So this is the problem.
[49:12.320 --> 49:14.360]  And I'd love to hear your guys thoughts on this.
[49:14.360 --> 49:18.700]  We are recording the summer of 98 content tomorrow.
[49:19.200 --> 49:20.880]  And we talked about if we enjoy that,
[49:21.160 --> 49:24.020]  then doing something similar as like the winter of 98.
[49:24.300 --> 49:25.080]  And so I thought,
[49:25.160 --> 49:25.300]  okay,
[49:25.300 --> 49:25.900]  if we do,
[49:26.080 --> 49:28.760]  what is the definitive movie of the winter of 98?
[49:29.040 --> 49:31.260]  I realized you have two choices.
[49:31.580 --> 49:36.340]  You either have to use December from 98.
[49:36.540 --> 49:38.300]  And then January and February,
[49:38.300 --> 49:41.980]  which are the furthest months apart and feel ridiculous.
[49:43.320 --> 49:47.280]  Or December of 98 and then the January and February 99,
[49:47.680 --> 49:49.960]  which equally feels as ridiculous,
[49:50.140 --> 49:50.780]  if not more.
[49:51.100 --> 49:53.600]  I think you got to go with the former over the latter.
[49:53.800 --> 49:54.540]  I know it doesn't make,
[49:54.980 --> 49:56.920]  I know it doesn't really make sense,
[49:57.040 --> 49:59.520]  but I think it's got to be within the bounds of the year.
[49:59.600 --> 50:00.440]  So you got to go January,
[50:00.640 --> 50:00.960]  February,
[50:01.120 --> 50:01.500]  December.
[50:02.080 --> 50:02.920]  I agree.
[50:03.240 --> 50:05.080]  It just seems ridiculous.
[50:05.100 --> 50:05.700]  It's an elegant.
[50:06.040 --> 50:06.200]  Yeah,
[50:06.320 --> 50:06.700]  it's not,
[50:06.720 --> 50:07.340]  it's not ideal.
[50:08.040 --> 50:08.280]  Yeah,
[50:08.420 --> 50:08.860]  it's not.
[50:09.460 --> 50:13.100]  Time not being linear in that way is very off-putting.
[50:13.440 --> 50:16.720]  Is that why you never really hear about like the winter of 45?
[50:17.760 --> 50:18.000]  Like,
[50:18.040 --> 50:18.700]  is it going to be,
[50:19.440 --> 50:20.600]  it could be either end.
[50:21.280 --> 50:22.680]  I'm going to Google winter of 45.
[50:23.180 --> 50:24.040]  That's probably less of war.
[50:25.240 --> 50:25.960]  I picked a bad year.
[50:26.360 --> 50:26.800]  Yeah,
[50:26.920 --> 50:27.620]  not a good winter.
[50:27.880 --> 50:29.980]  The Dutch famine of 1944-1945,
[50:30.840 --> 50:33.200]  popularly known in the Netherlands as the Hunger Winter,
[50:33.460 --> 50:36.480]  was one of the major European World War II famines.
[50:37.080 --> 50:37.460]  Yeah,
[50:37.460 --> 50:37.960]  that's not fun.
[50:38.260 --> 50:39.080]  But that was my realization.
[50:39.540 --> 50:40.000]  I have,
[50:40.140 --> 50:42.320]  I have this problem with like the NBA.
[50:42.800 --> 50:45.180]  I feel like because it spans,
[50:46.960 --> 50:48.600]  like it goes over,
[50:49.080 --> 50:50.660]  like it just doesn't make sense.
[50:51.100 --> 50:52.100]  Baseball is all in one year.
[50:52.480 --> 50:55.360]  Baseball is the only sport that gets it right in that regard.
[50:55.560 --> 50:57.080]  Because hockey and football do the same shit.
[50:57.660 --> 50:57.840]  Yeah,
[50:58.060 --> 50:59.180]  even college football now.
[50:59.420 --> 50:59.560]  Yeah,
[50:59.580 --> 50:59.920]  it's like,
[50:59.980 --> 51:00.180]  oh yeah,
[51:00.260 --> 51:00.380]  the,
[51:00.600 --> 51:00.900]  like,
[51:01.440 --> 51:01.800]  you know,
[51:02.280 --> 51:03.360]  the 2012 season.
[51:03.360 --> 51:06.740]  It's like the 2012 season or the 2013 season or the 2011 season.
[51:06.840 --> 51:07.360]  It's that.
[51:07.500 --> 51:08.020]  I don't like that.
[51:08.400 --> 51:10.580]  But they use it like the year it starts is that season.
[51:11.480 --> 51:11.620]  Yeah,
[51:11.680 --> 51:12.800]  they call it like an NBA.
[51:12.940 --> 51:13.940]  They say like the 2020,
[51:14.160 --> 51:18.760]  like right now we're in the 2023-2024 season.
[51:19.080 --> 51:19.340]  Right.
[51:19.420 --> 51:21.000]  Isn't that a cool way to put it?
[51:21.020 --> 51:23.700]  Like sports games always have the year ahead of the year you're in.
[51:24.080 --> 51:24.740]  It'll just say that.
[51:24.900 --> 51:25.140]  Yeah.
[51:25.420 --> 51:25.580]  Yeah.
[51:26.280 --> 51:26.640]  Yeah,
[51:26.720 --> 51:27.080]  exactly.
[51:27.360 --> 51:28.140]  That's exactly why.
[51:28.560 --> 51:30.700]  Like we'll get mad in 24 this year.
[51:31.240 --> 51:31.380]  See,
[51:31.380 --> 51:32.040]  it doesn't make any sense.
[51:32.040 --> 51:32.560]  I don't like it.
[51:32.660 --> 51:32.780]  No,
[51:32.840 --> 51:33.100]  it doesn't.
[51:33.260 --> 51:33.820]  It's very confusing.
[51:34.360 --> 51:34.400]  No.
[51:35.000 --> 51:35.240]  Oh,
[51:35.260 --> 51:37.380]  can I tell you got something cool I saw recently?
[51:37.520 --> 51:37.880]  Please.
[51:38.180 --> 51:40.720]  So when I was in Michigan for the last,
[51:40.840 --> 51:41.920]  for that little vacation,
[51:42.360 --> 51:42.760]  um,
[51:42.920 --> 51:44.260]  I was in the like Detroit,
[51:44.400 --> 51:44.900]  Dearborn,
[51:45.060 --> 51:45.820]  Grosse Pointe,
[51:45.820 --> 51:46.180]  uh,
[51:46.180 --> 51:48.180]  area and they have,
[51:48.340 --> 51:48.800]  uh,
[51:50.460 --> 51:52.680]  apparently Ford is a big deal in Michigan.
[51:52.880 --> 51:53.360]  I guess,
[51:53.400 --> 51:53.840]  uh,
[51:53.900 --> 51:54.240]  they,
[51:54.340 --> 51:54.620]  uh,
[51:54.620 --> 51:56.220]  revolutionized the world or something.
[51:56.640 --> 51:57.900]  And so the everything is Ford.
[51:58.260 --> 51:58.480]  Uh,
[51:58.480 --> 51:59.360]  there's like a Ford museum.
[51:59.580 --> 52:00.300]  There's a Ford house.
[52:00.300 --> 52:02.360]  There's this place called Greenfield Village,
[52:02.460 --> 52:03.020]  which,
[52:03.360 --> 52:03.700]  uh,
[52:03.800 --> 52:05.940]  Henry Ford had built like in the 1920s.
[52:06.140 --> 52:07.220]  It's the prototype.
[52:07.840 --> 52:08.000]  Uh,
[52:08.000 --> 52:09.720]  it was the inspiration for Disneyland.
[52:10.080 --> 52:11.200]  It's like this period.
[52:11.260 --> 52:11.600]  I,
[52:11.600 --> 52:14.480]  I assume like very similar to what you went to when you went to Colonial
[52:14.480 --> 52:16.260]  Williamsburg on a vacation for some reason,
[52:16.320 --> 52:16.500]  Gavin.
[52:17.040 --> 52:17.120]  Yeah.
[52:17.260 --> 52:17.600]  Uh,
[52:17.760 --> 52:20.240]  like everybody dresses in like period appropriate garb and stuff,
[52:20.260 --> 52:22.780]  but they've built like an entire town and you can like,
[52:22.820 --> 52:24.260]  it takes more than a day to go through it.
[52:24.280 --> 52:27.400]  And they have like a train that goes through it and you can like get taxis
[52:27.400 --> 52:29.200]  that are Model T's that drive you around.
[52:29.720 --> 52:30.100]  And they,
[52:30.980 --> 52:31.460]  uh,
[52:31.600 --> 52:32.920]  they did the craziest thing though,
[52:32.960 --> 52:34.600]  is that in this Greenfield Village,
[52:34.760 --> 52:37.500]  because Henry Ford had more money than God,
[52:37.900 --> 52:39.940]  he just bought everything cool.
[52:40.280 --> 52:43.320]  He bought the Wright Brothers bicycle shop,
[52:43.420 --> 52:45.900]  like the actual building where they learned,
[52:46.020 --> 52:47.400]  where they invented the plane.
[52:47.500 --> 52:50.620]  And he just moved it and then set it down in Greenfield Village.
[52:50.740 --> 52:53.180]  And then he bought their house and he did the same thing.
[52:53.180 --> 52:58.120]  He bought Thomas Edison's laboratory from New Jersey and had it brought over
[52:58.120 --> 52:59.360]  and rebuilt right there.
[52:59.520 --> 53:01.680]  And you can go in and tour it and go through all their stuff.
[53:02.180 --> 53:02.440]  Um,
[53:02.440 --> 53:05.080]  so they have just all this crazy Americana effemina.
[53:05.760 --> 53:07.360]  And in the museum,
[53:07.620 --> 53:08.580]  like the main museum,
[53:09.140 --> 53:10.340]  they have some,
[53:10.480 --> 53:11.540]  they go fucking hard.
[53:11.780 --> 53:14.860]  I saw the chair Lincoln was assassinated in.
[53:15.840 --> 53:16.400]  Dog.
[53:16.840 --> 53:17.720]  It's still,
[53:17.840 --> 53:17.960]  yeah,
[53:18.100 --> 53:19.340]  it still has like,
[53:19.420 --> 53:21.240]  like dark spots on it.
[53:21.240 --> 53:24.820]  It's just fucking sitting there in a museum in Michigan.
[53:24.960 --> 53:27.380]  I never would have thought that that'd be something that would be in a museum,
[53:27.500 --> 53:28.360]  but I guess it makes sense.
[53:28.460 --> 53:28.560]  But,
[53:29.100 --> 53:29.300]  uh,
[53:29.320 --> 53:32.560]  you don't think like Detroit and then like all this famous gruesome stuff.
[53:32.700 --> 53:35.300]  I saw the car Kennedy was assassinated in.
[53:35.760 --> 53:35.820]  I,
[53:35.920 --> 53:37.460]  I was right there.
[53:37.980 --> 53:41.440]  They just have all the shit where people died.
[53:41.480 --> 53:42.460]  And it's right there.
[53:42.860 --> 53:44.420]  Crazy thing about that Kennedy car,
[53:44.540 --> 53:44.780]  you know,
[53:44.780 --> 53:45.680]  the one where he got popped,
[53:46.160 --> 53:46.560]  uh,
[53:47.380 --> 53:49.800]  you would think that they would retire that car.
[53:49.800 --> 53:51.200]  They didn't.
[53:51.480 --> 53:53.460]  They cleaned it up and kept using it.
[53:53.580 --> 53:55.180]  They used it for two more presidents.
[53:55.920 --> 53:56.000]  No,
[53:56.080 --> 53:56.860]  it's evidence.
[53:57.600 --> 53:57.900]  Yeah.
[53:58.120 --> 54:00.200]  They built a special roof on it.
[54:00.900 --> 54:01.020]  And,
[54:01.020 --> 54:01.800]  and,
[54:01.800 --> 54:01.980]  uh,
[54:01.980 --> 54:05.480]  and then they continued using it until like 1977 or something.
[54:05.760 --> 54:07.240]  So who was the guy when,
[54:07.420 --> 54:09.960]  when Lincoln got done in the theater or whatever,
[54:10.400 --> 54:10.640]  did,
[54:11.220 --> 54:11.760]  who was the,
[54:11.840 --> 54:15.420]  like how quickly between the bullet entering his head was someone like,
[54:15.540 --> 54:15.700]  Oh,
[54:15.720 --> 54:17.080]  I could sell this chair for a lot.
[54:17.340 --> 54:19.720]  Like what was the time period between those two?
[54:20.880 --> 54:22.560]  Somebody's trying to unscrew the chair.
[54:23.780 --> 54:25.380]  Can I buy this chair?
[54:25.680 --> 54:25.840]  Dude,
[54:25.940 --> 54:26.520]  I have no idea,
[54:26.620 --> 54:29.540]  but something else that's even fucking weirder about that chair is that dude
[54:29.540 --> 54:30.580]  died in the theater,
[54:30.640 --> 54:30.940]  right?
[54:31.300 --> 54:31.480]  Yeah.
[54:31.620 --> 54:32.460]  Like watching a play.
[54:33.060 --> 54:33.080]  And,
[54:33.160 --> 54:33.480]  uh,
[54:33.620 --> 54:34.240]  and in the theater,
[54:34.300 --> 54:34.700]  what do we do?
[54:34.760 --> 54:35.940]  We're fucking quiet and we,
[54:35.940 --> 54:37.760]  we mind our P's and Q's and we don't make noise.
[54:37.920 --> 54:39.260]  It's a rocking chair.
[54:39.480 --> 54:41.500]  Why would you have a rocking chair at a theater?
[54:42.880 --> 54:44.100]  If you're the president,
[54:44.280 --> 54:46.040]  I feel like I would want a rocking chair.
[54:46.080 --> 54:48.140]  If I could demand a rocking chair anywhere,
[54:48.140 --> 54:50.240]  I'm always demanding a rocking chair.
[54:50.240 --> 54:52.320]  Had WD-40 been invented by that point?
[54:52.780 --> 54:53.040]  No,
[54:53.260 --> 54:53.620]  I don't think.
[54:53.700 --> 54:53.880]  Well,
[54:53.920 --> 54:54.320]  I don't know.
[54:54.440 --> 54:55.400]  I don't think so.
[54:56.600 --> 54:58.880]  Was it just one rocking chair and the rest were fixed?
[54:59.100 --> 55:00.180]  Or were they all rockers?
[55:01.000 --> 55:01.800]  I don't know.
[55:02.020 --> 55:02.520]  Maybe he,
[55:02.600 --> 55:04.160]  maybe he only rolled in rocking chairs.
[55:04.300 --> 55:04.800]  Maybe that was like,
[55:04.820 --> 55:05.660]  it was like in his rider.
[55:06.140 --> 55:07.280]  They just knew ahead of time.
[55:07.640 --> 55:09.800]  It was green M&Ms and rocking chairs for president Lincoln.
[55:09.900 --> 55:12.580]  What a weird historical item to look at.
[55:12.780 --> 55:13.160]  Yeah.
[55:13.380 --> 55:15.780]  That mean they had other non-depressing stuff.
[55:15.800 --> 55:18.020]  Did they have the car that Tupac was shot in as well?
[55:18.020 --> 55:21.140]  Like what other assassination memorabilia was there?
[55:21.200 --> 55:24.100]  I didn't see any other assassination memorabilia that I can remember.
[55:24.200 --> 55:26.040]  That was the stuff that just really stood out.
[55:26.120 --> 55:29.440]  They had other presidential cars where presidents didn't die in them.
[55:29.680 --> 55:31.760]  They had a lot of airplanes and old cars and shit.
[55:31.960 --> 55:37.340]  They built a holiday inn motel in the middle of it as an exhibit.
[55:37.420 --> 55:41.040]  So you can like go in like a 1950s first run holiday inn motel
[55:41.040 --> 55:43.040]  and see like what it looked like is kind of cool.
[55:43.520 --> 55:44.940]  They had a exhibit.
[55:45.560 --> 55:46.960]  It's a fucking weird collection of stuff.
[55:46.960 --> 55:50.000]  They had an exhibit that was an entire like two rooms
[55:50.700 --> 55:55.480]  that's just every single hallmark Christmas ornament ever made.
[55:56.940 --> 55:57.640]  Oh wow.
[55:57.920 --> 56:00.700]  It's like, I was telling Eric, it's like Snoopy Town dude.
[56:00.760 --> 56:01.920]  There's like 10,000 Snoopy towns.
[56:01.920 --> 56:03.000]  Yeah, there'd be a lot of Snoopy.
[56:03.000 --> 56:03.900]  He would have been in fucking heaven.
[56:04.120 --> 56:05.520]  He would have been jacking off left and right.
[56:06.440 --> 56:06.880]  Fuck.
[56:07.840 --> 56:10.060]  Anyway, right next to Lincoln's desk.
[56:10.060 --> 56:10.780]  I don't ask.
[56:11.300 --> 56:13.600]  Don't come on the chair, you're in Snoopy Town.
[56:13.880 --> 56:14.620]  What the fuck?
[56:15.140 --> 56:16.860]  Get away from the car as well.
[56:17.780 --> 56:20.080]  There's no safe place to come in here.
[56:20.220 --> 56:22.020]  Get off that Wright Brothers bicycle.
[56:22.320 --> 56:22.880]  Get out of Snoopy Town.
[56:22.880 --> 56:26.380]  Why is there so many historical objects in this museum?
[56:26.740 --> 56:27.860]  Not on the Hindenburg.
[56:30.520 --> 56:31.900]  Anyway, that's a cool place.
[56:31.980 --> 56:34.220]  But I was just blown away that you could just go to a museum
[56:34.220 --> 56:38.180]  and just see all the things that people sat in when they got assassinated.
[56:38.280 --> 56:40.480]  Would you be pissed if someone monetized your assassination?
[56:41.200 --> 56:41.500]  No.
[56:42.300 --> 56:42.700]  No.
[56:43.160 --> 56:43.440]  No.
[56:43.440 --> 56:45.680]  I think I'd be indifferent at that stage.
[56:46.480 --> 56:47.240]  I mean...
[56:47.240 --> 56:49.320]  I feel like the money should go to the family at least.
[56:49.720 --> 56:50.500]  Well, maybe it does.
[56:50.660 --> 56:53.960]  Maybe they'll work out like a cut or something.
[56:54.540 --> 56:55.260]  Yeah, I don't know.
[56:55.480 --> 57:00.260]  You know, if I would have seen Lincoln's death chair without context,
[57:00.600 --> 57:03.420]  I would assume that was just a retired Santa chair.
[57:03.700 --> 57:05.360]  It has real Santa chair vibes.
[57:05.600 --> 57:06.160]  Yeah, it really does.
[57:06.940 --> 57:07.900]  It really does.
[57:08.120 --> 57:09.580]  Looks like North Pole style.
[57:09.580 --> 57:13.340]  Was any of the ceiling from above Hitler there?
[57:14.500 --> 57:15.880]  I didn't look.
[57:16.200 --> 57:18.480]  It was mostly American shit, you know?
[57:18.680 --> 57:19.180]  So, I don't know.
[57:19.720 --> 57:24.840]  You might have to go to the BMW or the Mercedes museum in Germany to see that.
[57:25.420 --> 57:28.140]  Could you imagine pulling that as like a trading card?
[57:28.320 --> 57:29.140]  As like a set?
[57:29.300 --> 57:31.720]  Like one of 99 Lincoln's death chair.
[57:33.840 --> 57:36.160]  The exhaust from the JFK car.
[57:36.480 --> 57:37.120]  I don't...
[57:37.120 --> 57:40.940]  You're saying, Gavin, do you want your assassination to be monetized?
[57:41.300 --> 57:46.800]  I would be more upset about the fact that JFK was like the beta tester for what they need to do to prevent it.
[57:47.300 --> 57:49.920]  They threw a hood on or whatever Geoff said, or a roof.
[57:50.100 --> 57:50.980]  Like, they changed it.
[57:51.140 --> 57:53.760]  Like, they took notes from what happened and then made adjustments.
[57:54.400 --> 57:56.200]  I'm pretty sure they'd already figured that out back then.
[57:56.260 --> 57:58.000]  He was just in a convertible for some reason.
[57:58.580 --> 58:02.320]  Well, there weren't a lot of assassinations back then, so they hadn't had been in need.
[58:02.320 --> 58:05.560]  Yeah, I don't think that that was a problem they felt they had to solve.
[58:05.560 --> 58:08.120]  And then they're like, well, we clearly can't have that happen again.
[58:08.180 --> 58:09.380]  Well, when was Franz Ferdinand?
[58:09.960 --> 58:10.920]  Uh, that was way before.
[58:11.040 --> 58:12.360]  Yeah, that was World War I.
[58:12.480 --> 58:13.380]  Winter of 48.
[58:13.740 --> 58:14.360]  There's the car.
[58:14.440 --> 58:16.640]  You can see they put that special, like, roof over it.
[58:17.780 --> 58:17.980]  Yeah.
[58:18.180 --> 58:18.840]  Now, I would have...
[58:18.840 --> 58:22.000]  If I was a ghost and I was JFK, I'd be like, couldn't have done that before.
[58:22.640 --> 58:23.720]  Had to do that after.
[58:24.280 --> 58:25.420]  Didn't consider that before.
[58:25.720 --> 58:29.040]  I think it existed, but they...
[58:29.040 --> 58:32.940]  I honestly think it existed, but they took it off because it was a nice day.
[58:33.220 --> 58:34.060]  I want to say.
[58:34.060 --> 58:36.780]  I want to say they said that, that there was, like, a little thing that said that, like,
[58:36.880 --> 58:40.960]  like, they had the roof and it could have been on, but it was just, like, a really nice day.
[58:41.120 --> 58:42.760]  And they were like, well, let's take the top off.
[58:43.120 --> 58:44.420]  And then, you know...
[58:44.420 --> 58:44.840]  Tragedy.
[58:45.300 --> 58:45.460]  Yeah.
[58:46.060 --> 58:47.280]  Then he ended up in a museum.
[58:47.660 --> 58:48.600]  Ended up in a museum.
[58:49.640 --> 58:54.760]  Um, we're getting close to the end of the show here, and I want to make sure that we have time for Andrew to drink.
[58:55.420 --> 58:55.740]  Okay.
[58:56.900 --> 59:02.920]  Explain his... what he's done, and how he's done it, and what he's doing, and what he drinks.
[59:02.920 --> 59:05.940]  Because I need to know what these flavor combinations are.
[59:06.240 --> 59:06.700]  Okay.
[59:06.800 --> 59:09.020]  So I'm going to post a photo of what it currently looks like.
[59:09.120 --> 59:10.040]  This monstrosity.
[59:10.660 --> 59:14.100]  Uh, real mess of a juice situation we got going on.
[59:15.440 --> 59:17.280]  Um, what flavors are...
[59:17.280 --> 59:22.000]  It's, uh, watermelon and grape, and then lemon and grape.
[59:22.100 --> 59:22.700]  I don't have banana.
[59:22.860 --> 59:25.360]  I will do banana and the other one, uh, next time.
[59:25.520 --> 59:26.380]  They look pretty good.
[59:26.800 --> 59:30.520]  I feel like watermelon grape is going to be delicious.
[59:30.940 --> 59:34.320]  I think grape lemon is going to be a real problem.
[59:34.340 --> 59:38.100]  I like that you just put all the smushed grapes just tucked behind it.
[59:38.100 --> 59:44.960]  Well, yeah, I realized that with the watermelon, if I didn't clean the chamber, the juice would just shoot out the handle.
[59:45.580 --> 59:47.620]  Um, so we had to take them out.
[59:47.680 --> 59:49.980]  I will be eating this fruit later, because it is delicious.
[59:50.120 --> 59:53.140]  I'm about to... I'm going to go for the grape watermelon right now.
[59:53.480 --> 59:54.260]  Grape watermelon.
[59:54.400 --> 59:56.940]  I've never heard of that combination before in my life.
[59:57.060 --> 59:57.940]  And that's the one on the left.
[59:58.280 --> 59:58.860]  No, the one on the right.
[59:58.920 --> 59:59.800]  That's the right one.
[59:59.800 --> 01:00:00.960]  Yeah, the red one.
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:01.460]  Trying it.
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:04.020]  That was... that was not good.
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.540]  That was supposed to be the good one.
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.560]  What's the ratio? What's the ratio?
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:10.040]  How much grape to watermelon?
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:13.760]  It was equal parts grape to watermelon, green grape to watermelon.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.240]  I went equal parts on all things.
[01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:16.420]  What do you think is ruining it?
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:20.040]  That is way more sour than I thought it would be.
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:21.280]  I don't know why it's so sour.
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:22.260]  Sour grapes?
[01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:23.320]  Sour grapes.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:24.960]  It is a expression.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.200]  I think the grape probably overpowers the watermelon.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.880]  You probably want to go to, like, a 30-70 mix.
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:32.880]  Yeah, I think there needs to be some modifying.
[01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:36.080]  I think, like, 20 grape, 80 watermelon is probably...
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:39.980]  Well, I think you need to just have straight-up watermelon and straight-up grape to see if you hate one of them.
[01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:40.620]  Oh.
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:44.880]  Okay, well, I'm gonna do this again, so I'll have all the drinks ready next time.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:45.020]  Yeah.
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:46.800]  I won't bring the lab to the show.
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.200]  Okay, so now I'm gonna try...
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.280]  I'm gonna try the lemon and grape.
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.780]  The color on the lemon one is so lemony, man.
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:55.400]  I don't know.
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:57.660]  You can tell that it's starting to separate.
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:00.800]  There's clearly, like, a bottom layer that's gonna be all lemon.
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:05.200]  Also, I wonder if there's a difference between green grapes and red grapes.
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.220]  I assume there would be.
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:07.240]  Oh, definitely.
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:07.920]  100%.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:08.400]  For flavor, yeah.
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.880]  I felt green was better than red as far as what this test would be.
[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:14.600]  It's not, but yeah, that's fine.
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:15.640]  Why is it not?
[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:16.860]  Why is red equally good?
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.600]  For juicing, it just...
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.740]  I don't think a green grape is gonna give you what you want, which is sweet.
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:25.220]  It's gonna give you a little bit more of a kind of tart...
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:28.500]  You know, I would argue with you, but that was very sour what I just consumed.
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:31.340]  So you may be dead on right there.
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:33.160]  So maybe the grape adjustment as well.
[01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.400]  Are you guys familiar with cotton candy grapes?
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:36.140]  Yeah.
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:36.560]  No.
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:37.980]  Yeah, Nick is.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.660]  Those are the best tasting grapes on Earth.
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:40.120]  So good.
[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:43.420]  Are they, like, injected or are they just bred to taste like that?
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.460]  They're just bred to taste like that.
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.860]  Yeah, I don't think they taste like cotton candy at all.
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:47.260]  They don't.
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:48.460]  They just taste good as fuck.
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:49.780]  Yeah, they just taste like good...
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:51.700]  They taste like very, very sweet grapes.
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:53.400]  I don't know if the cotton candy thing is hilarious.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:54.160]  Yeah.
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:56.120]  So, I don't know, Andrew.
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:57.700]  What do you think of these new flavors you've invented?
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:01:59.820]  So far, first one not great.
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.020]  I'm about to take down the second one.
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:01.740]  Here we go.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.200]  That was actually...
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.200]  That sounded like an Andrew Dice Clay impression.
[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:16.520]  Oh, it's so sour.
[01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:19.480]  You just drank straight lemon juice.
[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:21.520]  It's so sour.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.940]  But it's good.
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:27.560]  That was actually better than the first one.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.740]  It just is really sour.
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:34.720]  I bet that one would be sold by a smoothie company as, like, an immunity boost of some sort.
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:37.560]  Oh, my face is tingling.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:41.260]  What would you do differently with that one?
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:45.560]  Too much lemon?
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:48.540]  I didn't really taste a lot of grape, I would say.
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:52.700]  So, probably more grape and a little less lemon.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.240]  Was that half and half again?
[01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:55.980]  That was half and half again.
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:57.000]  That's a lot of lemon.
[01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.520]  Yeah, I felt it.
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:04.860]  The sour was very overpowering, but the actual taste itself was not bad.
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:11.740]  The problem is, it's not bad because it essentially just tastes like lemonade.
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:16.340]  So, there's not an angle to invent an actual drink out of that.
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:20.420]  It's just everything I'm thinking of that would make it taste a little bit better is just turning it into lemonade.
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:24.560]  Well, maybe we could learn what you didn't like about the first one if you just had lemon and watermelon.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.300]  Yeah, but watermelon lemonade exists.
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.240]  It does, that's true.
[01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:33.860]  We're trying to break new ground.
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:35.120]  Good point.
[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:38.400]  Okay, well, I think this was a successful lab.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:42.420]  We've learned some things, I've taken some notes, I've adjusted some levels.
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.720]  Yeah, thanks for bringing us into the lab.
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:45.220]  Absolutely.
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:47.380]  Of course, it was my pleasure to do so.
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:51.780]  I will be back next episode with a few more drinks.
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:53.580]  Yeah, that sounds great.
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:56.740]  I guess we should probably wrap this up then.
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:00.060]  Andrew, I will endeavor to be back as well.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.520]  I was also going to do some experiments.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.620]  I can't wait to see your lab work.
[01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:05.380]  Yeah, I mean, we'll see how it differs.
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:09.820]  We can compare and contrast and hopefully we'll have that next week.
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.120]  I'll have ice cream gloves V2 ready pretty soon too.
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:15.540]  God, that's very exciting.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:19.720]  Alright, I guess we should wrap it up then.
[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:21.740]  Well, there you go.
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:23.720]  You made it all the way through.
[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:26.400]  Assuming that you're listening to this right now.
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.640]  If you're not listening, you didn't make it through.
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:28.800]  There's no point in talking to you.
[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:30.440]  You're not one of the real ones.
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:33.020]  Everybody else though, we really appreciate it.
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:34.060]  And here's a little tip.
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:37.020]  I just got into this new band called Clowncore.
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:39.180]  I recommend everybody else get into it too.
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:40.640]  They play in a porta-potty.
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.080]  And I'm going to go see them play live next month.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.900]  And they are going to play on stage in the porta-potty.
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.140]  Do they let the crowd get in there one by one?
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:50.640]  I don't know. I can't wait to find out.
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:53.200]  Ta-ta!
[01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:54.180]  Bye!
[01:04:57.710 --> 01:05:00.450]  That was such a villain laugh by Nick.
[01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:01.750]  That was alarming.
[01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:03.590]  I don't know what Ta-ta got me.
[01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:08.290]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:09.470]  Eric is famous.
[01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:11.310]  Everyone forgot about it.
[01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:13.210]  Penn has a lot of things to say.
[01:05:13.550 --> 01:05:15.170]  Gavin can carry two men.
[01:05:15.590 --> 01:05:16.410]  Geoff made a smoothie.
[01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:19.110]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:22.050]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
