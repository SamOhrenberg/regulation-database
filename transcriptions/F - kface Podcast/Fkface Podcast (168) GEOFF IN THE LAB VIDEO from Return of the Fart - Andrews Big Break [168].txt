[00:00.000 --> 00:02.600]  The Hammond didn't die there, did he? No, Hammond did not die.
[00:03.300 --> 00:07.340]  Did he? In the book he did. No, not in that movie. I mean, he's dead by now. He's very old then.
[00:07.560 --> 00:09.060]  All right, so here we go. This is a
[00:09.760 --> 00:12.540]  This is a home-brewed Purple Sorcerer X Redux.
[00:14.960 --> 00:18.740]  Yeah, we're looking at the face. Oh, it's going in. Judgment. I saw, I saw it go up the straw.
[00:18.800 --> 00:23.840]  Oh, he's a quite a big sip. Oh, that looks good. It looks like he loves this. Oh, he's going in for a second.
[00:24.340 --> 00:26.060]  He's gonna finish this, I think. I told you.
[00:27.180 --> 00:31.140]  He's demolished it. I fucking told you. Even with the ice in.
[00:32.860 --> 00:33.820]  Holy shit!
[00:34.340 --> 00:35.140]  That's good!
[00:36.380 --> 00:37.760]  That's fucking good!
[00:38.340 --> 00:40.260]  I told you. Oh my god!
[00:40.920 --> 00:42.640]  Geoff is like from the south.
[00:42.940 --> 00:43.800]  And this is just...
[00:44.300 --> 00:47.060]  This is just good. It's hummingbird food.
[00:47.380 --> 00:48.940]  Like, of course he loves it.
[00:49.600 --> 00:52.600]  Now, would you say you're a Kool-Aid guy generally, Geoff?
[00:52.640 --> 00:54.740]  Or is this like tapped into a new thing for you?
[00:54.740 --> 00:57.180]  Dude, I grew up in the 80s. I was a Kool-Aid kid.
[00:57.320 --> 00:59.840]  I don't think I've had Kool-Aid in 25 years.
[00:59.960 --> 01:00.900]  Oh my god!
[01:01.000 --> 01:02.000]  What have I been missing?
[01:03.380 --> 01:04.840]  I thought we'd come to a point...
[01:04.840 --> 01:05.980]  So summer of 98 was the last time?
[01:06.480 --> 01:09.000]  No. I guess it was older than that.
[01:10.120 --> 01:13.460]  I guess I thought we'd got to a point where we didn't have to mix our drinks anymore.
[01:13.580 --> 01:15.240]  You could buy them premixed. Fuck that, dude.
[01:15.280 --> 01:16.040]  I'm going back to mixing.
[01:16.620 --> 01:18.000]  Oh shit, that's good.
[01:18.920 --> 01:22.100]  It's just straight sugar. Can you talk about the flavor of it?
[01:22.180 --> 01:23.720]  Like mixing the purple with the yellow?
[01:23.720 --> 01:25.040]  How much sugar went in?
[01:25.280 --> 01:26.300]  Dude, it tastes like a purple dinosaur.
[01:26.760 --> 01:29.880]  It was one packet of...
[01:29.880 --> 01:31.080]  These are sugar free.
[01:31.160 --> 01:33.960]  It was one packet of unsweetened...
[01:34.540 --> 01:36.000]  One packet of unsweetened lemonade.
[01:36.140 --> 01:38.000]  One packet of unsweetened grape.
[01:38.680 --> 01:40.240]  Then four quarts of water.
[01:40.440 --> 01:41.860]  And two cups of sugar.
[01:44.080 --> 01:45.040]  Two cups?!
[01:45.040 --> 01:48.860]  Well, that's what the recipe is for fucking Kool-Aid.
[01:49.160 --> 01:50.340]  It's two quarts of water.
[01:50.620 --> 01:52.320]  A packet. And one cup of sugar.
[01:52.320 --> 01:53.760]  Or sweetened low or whatever.
[01:53.920 --> 01:56.180]  Of course he fucking loved it.
[01:56.240 --> 01:56.880]  This is insane.
[01:57.000 --> 02:00.020]  I can see why you've activated.
[02:03.100 --> 02:04.480]  Oh man, I'm into it.
[02:04.640 --> 02:05.640]  Oh, fucking...
[02:06.700 --> 02:07.660]  Sugar boner.
[02:08.060 --> 02:08.480]  God damn.
[02:09.620 --> 02:11.440]  You just walked out of a club bathroom.
[02:13.580 --> 02:15.920]  Now we'll move on to...
[02:15.920 --> 02:17.040]  Oh, he's stirring it up.
[02:17.200 --> 02:18.240]  He's mixing the goop.
[02:18.460 --> 02:20.560]  You can't really...
[02:20.560 --> 02:21.660]  You can't see how it was separated.
[02:21.900 --> 02:23.980]  It was liquid and then grit.
[02:24.320 --> 02:26.540]  This is the all grape one?
[02:26.740 --> 02:28.920]  This is homage to Trevor.
[02:29.840 --> 02:31.260]  He was instrumental in this.
[02:31.320 --> 02:32.600]  This was his initial burst of idea.
[02:33.360 --> 02:34.540]  This is grape suicide.
[02:34.820 --> 02:36.360]  Six different kinds of grape.
[02:36.760 --> 02:38.820]  From concord to green
[02:38.820 --> 02:40.540]  to other stuff.
[02:41.240 --> 02:42.640]  Are you going to suck from the middle of the cup
[02:42.640 --> 02:45.040]  for the best consistency
[02:45.040 --> 02:45.900]  or are you going to go from the bottom?
[02:46.660 --> 02:47.340]  Middle of the cup.
[02:50.700 --> 02:52.420]  It's not as thick as I was expecting.
[02:52.620 --> 02:53.960]  It seemed to glide right in.
[02:55.640 --> 02:57.260]  It's like a frothy grape juice.
[02:58.080 --> 02:59.320]  Doesn't taste any better
[02:59.320 --> 03:01.060]  or worse than any grape juice I've ever had.
[03:01.620 --> 03:02.080]  Tastes fresh.
[03:02.280 --> 03:04.920]  They're all pretty similar tasting,
[03:05.160 --> 03:05.680]  don't you think?
[03:06.640 --> 03:07.900]  Tell us about the candy grape.
[03:08.280 --> 03:10.640]  I don't think so because Emily will eat
[03:10.640 --> 03:12.200]  green grapes but won't touch a red grape,
[03:12.280 --> 03:13.120]  which is fucking weird to me.
[03:13.760 --> 03:15.180]  That's crazy and backwards.
[03:16.600 --> 03:17.740]  It was good.
[03:18.700 --> 03:20.080]  Not better than just going
[03:20.080 --> 03:21.160]  and buying...
[03:21.980 --> 03:22.860]  That's not true.
[03:23.420 --> 03:23.840]  It's good.
[03:24.680 --> 03:27.080]  I'm going to give Purple Sorcerer X a 10 out of 10.
[03:27.420 --> 03:29.220]  I'm going to give Grape Suicide
[03:32.240 --> 03:33.120]  8.7
[03:34.920 --> 03:35.620]  It's pretty good.
[03:35.740 --> 03:36.940]  But I don't know that I would...
[03:36.940 --> 03:38.720]  It's a lot of effort to go
[03:38.720 --> 03:40.200]  when you can just buy grape juice.
[03:40.780 --> 03:42.960]  But certainly it's not the most effort
[03:42.960 --> 03:44.540]  which you're about to get into now.
[03:44.540 --> 03:45.780]  Doom of the loom.
[03:46.580 --> 03:48.460]  Doom of the loom, this is something like
[03:48.460 --> 03:50.400]  35 different fruits combined.
[03:50.760 --> 03:51.900]  Dude, that is vibrant.
[03:52.180 --> 03:54.860]  Everything turns into grape,
[03:55.140 --> 03:55.600]  apparently.
[03:57.200 --> 03:57.780]  Everything's purple.
[03:58.280 --> 04:00.400]  How are your ratios? Do you think you've balanced it out well
[04:00.400 --> 04:01.780]  or do you think one's going to be overpowering?
[04:02.780 --> 04:04.480]  I have no fucking clue.
[04:04.660 --> 04:06.040]  I just put a handful of ingredients.
[04:08.080 --> 04:09.180]  I'm so excited.
[04:09.280 --> 04:09.720]  I don't know.
[04:10.740 --> 04:12.500]  I had no idea how to gauge
[04:12.500 --> 04:14.600]  how much or how little of certain things.
[04:14.940 --> 04:16.640]  I... no clue.
[04:17.540 --> 04:19.300]  I wish I could be tasting these.
[04:21.740 --> 04:22.480]  Here it goes.
[04:22.540 --> 04:24.860]  He's preparing. Deep breath.
[04:25.460 --> 04:26.920]  This might be the first $100
[04:26.920 --> 04:28.280]  smoothie anyone's ever drank.
[04:30.300 --> 04:32.060]  It's the Jimmy Butler of smoothies.
[04:34.400 --> 04:36.800]  Oh, look at the way it got stuck halfway up the straw.
[04:36.860 --> 04:37.680]  This one's thick.
[04:38.840 --> 04:40.280]  Oh god, he's going for it.
[04:40.280 --> 04:41.380]  Oh, it seems chunky.
[04:41.540 --> 04:43.020]  But maybe a good chunk.
[04:43.380 --> 04:44.280]  There can be a good chunk.
[04:47.060 --> 04:47.520]  Oh.
[04:49.840 --> 04:52.060]  He seems perplexed.
[04:52.180 --> 04:54.480]  And not a bad one. Oh, no, that looked a little bad.
[04:55.280 --> 04:56.100]  I'll be honest with you.
[04:57.000 --> 04:58.600]  It tastes identical
[04:58.600 --> 05:00.540]  to every purple
[05:00.540 --> 05:01.960]  smoothie I've ever bought.
[05:02.240 --> 05:04.480]  Oh, that's so disappointing.
[05:04.880 --> 05:06.300]  From Jamba Juice or Juiceland.
[05:06.580 --> 05:08.620]  It doesn't taste $90
[05:08.620 --> 05:10.660]  more expensive than the last smoothie.
[05:11.080 --> 05:12.940]  Yeah, it's a $100, $18 smoothie
[05:12.940 --> 05:13.620]  is what you've got there.
[05:14.020 --> 05:16.520]  It's a $100, $9 smoothie. Oh my god.
[05:16.920 --> 05:18.120]  I mean, it's good, don't get me wrong.
[05:18.440 --> 05:21.020]  Even though it's a lot of fruit, I'm supposed to not combine
[05:21.020 --> 05:21.460]  apparently.
[05:23.020 --> 05:24.780]  You're going to be shitting tonight.
[05:25.160 --> 05:26.880]  This is like a... I mean, it's fine
[05:26.880 --> 05:28.640]  as a smoothie, but you can save yourself $95
[05:29.120 --> 05:29.480]  and...
[05:33.190 --> 05:34.290]  That was fantastic.
[05:34.390 --> 05:34.710]  A little bitter.
[05:36.130 --> 05:38.330]  This might be the best lab work anyone's ever done.
[05:38.830 --> 05:40.290]  Oh man, thank you so much.
[05:40.790 --> 05:42.670]  That's really kind of you. I don't know if they can compare
[05:42.670 --> 05:44.250]  with sleep spaghetti, but I really appreciate that.
[05:45.070 --> 05:46.330]  Sorry, maybe I didn't hear it.
[05:46.390 --> 05:48.150]  Was there a number rating that you ascribed to this?
[05:48.710 --> 05:50.590]  Oh, I'll give it a...
[05:50.590 --> 05:51.630]  It's an 8.
[05:52.510 --> 05:54.110]  So a 10, an 8.7, and an 8.
[05:54.110 --> 05:55.350]  It's the worst of the three.
[05:55.810 --> 05:57.770]  It's like doing an episode of AMA.
[05:58.870 --> 06:00.670]  Everything is a 10 or...
[06:00.670 --> 06:02.550]  As high as a 10 or as low as a
[06:02.550 --> 06:03.630]  7.7.
[06:05.390 --> 06:06.370]  That was good tonight.
[06:06.370 --> 06:07.410]  Alright, well there you go.
[06:07.890 --> 06:09.510]  That was very informative.
[06:11.410 --> 06:12.550]  Unless I'm struck
[06:12.550 --> 06:14.370]  by some brilliant idea in the shower
[06:14.370 --> 06:15.410]  or like in a dream,
[06:15.970 --> 06:18.450]  I think I might be done combining fruit.
[06:18.910 --> 06:20.470]  Oh man, there's so much acid.
[06:21.430 --> 06:22.230]  That smoothie...
[06:22.230 --> 06:23.830]  Oh, it's coming back? It's fighting you now?
[06:23.870 --> 06:25.390]  Do you think you could have used the gloves
[06:25.390 --> 06:27.050]  for the fruit?
[06:27.190 --> 06:29.550]  Yeah, I could have used the fruit gloves if they existed.
[06:30.390 --> 06:31.830]  Dude, fuck. Hold on a second.
[06:32.450 --> 06:34.190]  Here's a... I'll turn my camera back on.
[06:36.610 --> 06:38.450]  What do we look...
[06:38.450 --> 06:39.390]  He's really...
[06:39.390 --> 06:42.810]  This is the basket. It's full of all the ingredients
[06:42.810 --> 06:43.630]  for the fruit gloves.
[06:44.630 --> 06:46.150]  It's a steak!
[06:46.530 --> 06:48.910]  It's so much stuff. I got so many gadgets.
[06:49.750 --> 06:50.810]  Is that a light?
[06:51.270 --> 06:52.390]  Yeah, I've got some... look at this.
[06:52.430 --> 06:54.650]  Look at this guy. I've got so
[06:54.650 --> 06:55.510]  much stuff.
[06:57.010 --> 06:58.530]  I can't wait.
[06:58.650 --> 07:00.310]  He's gonna have a blender on one end of it.
[07:00.430 --> 07:02.230]  Look at these little knives.
[07:02.550 --> 07:04.330]  I've got so much stuff to put this...
[07:04.330 --> 07:06.550]  It became overwhelming, but...
[07:06.550 --> 07:08.890]  You know what? I'm gonna get back to it.
[07:08.930 --> 07:10.370]  I'm gonna do it. If you can make those heat gloves,
[07:10.470 --> 07:11.150]  I can make the fruit gloves.
[07:11.910 --> 07:14.750]  You would have more gadgets in your hand
[07:14.750 --> 07:16.470]  than Inspector Gadget as a whole
[07:16.470 --> 07:18.490]  based off of what you have in that basket.
[07:19.750 --> 07:20.610]  That sounds crazy.
[07:20.750 --> 07:21.650]  That sounds accurate to me, yes.
[07:23.150 --> 07:24.640]  It's gonna be Fruit's Worst Nightmare.
[07:25.290 --> 07:26.550]  Oh man, that's
[07:26.550 --> 07:28.690]  some really acidic smoothie. God damn.
[07:28.770 --> 07:29.450]  You wanna punch
[07:29.450 --> 07:31.430]  the base of some kind.
[07:32.290 --> 07:33.750]  I think you might be in trouble
[07:33.750 --> 07:34.830]  if you finish that smoothie.
[07:34.970 --> 07:36.730]  I'm not gonna finish it.
[07:37.190 --> 07:38.230]  I'm not gonna finish it.
[07:38.790 --> 07:41.490]  I just had 7,000 calories
[07:41.490 --> 07:42.190]  of purple source.
[07:43.830 --> 07:45.650]  You had a whole cup of sugar.
