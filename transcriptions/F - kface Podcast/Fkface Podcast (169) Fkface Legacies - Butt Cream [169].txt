[00:10.340 --> 00:15.840]  We have the summer of 98 top 10 movie, not draft, but we picked the top 10
[00:15.840 --> 00:20.700]  movies of the summer of 98, September 8th for first members, September 9th for
[00:20.700 --> 00:25.060]  everyone else will be the summer of 98 ultimate playlist.

[00:30.380 --> 00:33.520]  There's more September 15th at 10 a.m.
[00:33.540 --> 00:34.380]  You've been waiting for it.
[00:34.460 --> 00:36.460]  It's the Gerpler restock.
[00:36.580 --> 00:40.080]  We have some really cool stuff going with the Gerpler limited card.
[00:40.320 --> 00:41.520]  Keep your eyes peeled.

[00:44.860 --> 00:49.400]  You can get a first look at that and our big day, September 29th, we're doing
[00:49.400 --> 00:51.740]  double duty because at 10 a.m.

[00:55.480 --> 01:00.920]  Episode 16 brought to you one more time, different sleeve, same album, but that's
[01:00.920 --> 01:02.720]  not all because at 10 p.m.
[01:02.720 --> 01:08.540]  We'll be playing sloppy Joe's bingo to bring you our sloppy bingo set, our
[01:08.540 --> 01:14.460]  fridge magnet of Geoff's fridge and the VCK desk mat, 10 a.m.
[01:14.560 --> 01:16.600]  The vinyl reissue, 10 p.m.
[01:16.680 --> 01:17.700]  Sloppy Joe's bingo.
[01:18.140 --> 01:22.840]  There's a lot on the horizon for F*** Face and there's even more we can't talk
[01:22.840 --> 01:23.360]  about yet.
[01:23.720 --> 01:27.240]  So again, do follow us at F*** Face pod on Instagram and on Twitter.
[01:27.540 --> 01:28.820]  Keep up to date with everything.
[01:29.200 --> 01:30.900]  But for now, enjoy this episode.
[01:41.850 --> 01:42.710]  Hey, Gavin.
[01:42.990 --> 01:43.450]  Hi, Gavin.
[01:43.610 --> 01:45.350]  When was the last time you went to pound town?
[01:48.230 --> 01:49.690]  Have you ever been to pound town?
[01:50.330 --> 01:51.850]  I have not been to pound town.
[01:52.330 --> 01:55.190]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face podcast.
[01:55.370 --> 01:56.130]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[01:56.250 --> 02:01.490]  With me as always, Gavin Free, who has never been to pound town and Andrew
[02:01.490 --> 02:03.670]  Panton, who frequents pound town.
[02:03.790 --> 02:04.350]  How's it going, guys?
[02:04.370 --> 02:05.010]  I wish I did.
[02:05.010 --> 02:05.670]  What country is it in?
[02:05.750 --> 02:06.310]  I don't know.
[02:06.370 --> 02:07.210]  That's a great question.
[02:07.430 --> 02:08.170]  I'm assuming Canada.
[02:08.590 --> 02:10.110]  Eric says it's episode 196.
[02:10.610 --> 02:10.770]  Nope.
[02:11.610 --> 02:12.250]  169, baby.
[02:12.890 --> 02:13.990]  69, baby.
[02:14.810 --> 02:15.950]  Glad it's not 196.
[02:16.310 --> 02:17.010]  That would...
[02:17.010 --> 02:20.230]  I feel like there's a lot of pressure to really deliver on episode 200 and I'm
[02:20.230 --> 02:21.550]  not, I'm not ready for that yet.
[02:21.950 --> 02:22.470]  I need time.
[02:22.570 --> 02:23.950]  I don't agree with that.
[02:24.350 --> 02:24.750]  I don't either.
[02:25.050 --> 02:25.550]  I don't.
[02:25.690 --> 02:29.590]  It's the same with like live episodes where people are like, we gotta, do you
[02:29.590 --> 02:31.270]  gotta like really show out for this?
[02:31.450 --> 02:34.890]  And it's like, I think people really like the thing that they listen to every
[02:34.890 --> 02:39.450]  week and just turning in a really strong effort every time is like the way to do
[02:39.450 --> 02:39.890]  it.
[02:39.910 --> 02:40.210]  Okay.
[02:40.370 --> 02:40.830]  That's how I feel.
[02:41.090 --> 02:42.230]  No, I feel differently.
[02:42.430 --> 02:44.390]  I think all the pressure's on episode 196.
[02:45.050 --> 02:45.410]  That's all.
[02:45.870 --> 02:46.310]  Wow.
[02:46.510 --> 02:47.130]  Don't do that.
[02:47.710 --> 02:48.570]  Don't, don't do that.
[02:48.570 --> 02:49.910]  That was a simple...
[02:49.910 --> 02:51.510]  Has to be very good.
[02:51.690 --> 02:51.710]  No.
[02:52.270 --> 02:52.710]  196.
[02:53.850 --> 02:54.570]  This sucks.
[02:56.010 --> 02:57.690]  That's future Geoff's problem, Nick says.
[02:58.430 --> 02:59.310]  Uh, okay.
[02:59.590 --> 03:02.050]  Episode 169.
[03:02.150 --> 03:06.390]  Uh, do you, uh, what do you guys want to do?
[03:07.410 --> 03:08.470]  What do we want to do?
[03:08.530 --> 03:09.570]  I think talk to each other.
[03:09.650 --> 03:09.990]  All right.
[03:10.010 --> 03:10.650]  Let's talk to each other.
[03:10.910 --> 03:11.330]  That's typically how this works.
[03:11.450 --> 03:14.390]  Andrew, my longest arm is 29.5 inches.
[03:14.590 --> 03:16.710]  No, 29.5.
[03:16.950 --> 03:17.210]  Yeah.
[03:17.910 --> 03:19.850]  What do you, what do you need with that information?
[03:20.190 --> 03:21.090]  I'm 27.5.
[03:21.210 --> 03:22.290]  Well, we kind of talked about before.
[03:22.350 --> 03:24.830]  I was just thinking about my arm length.
[03:25.210 --> 03:28.370]  I would enjoy being like three or four inches taller.
[03:29.110 --> 03:30.970]  Yeah, we kind of went over it a little bit.
[03:31.010 --> 03:34.430]  I just didn't know how much you don't have to include any of that in there.
[03:37.070 --> 03:37.430]  What?
[03:38.030 --> 03:40.970]  You know, we didn't cut that because we don't need to cut that.
[03:41.110 --> 03:42.330]  We're making what I want to know.
[03:42.770 --> 03:43.470]  What's happening?
[03:44.090 --> 03:47.490]  What I want to know is how much of your arm you cut out for additional height.
[03:47.630 --> 03:48.750]  Are you happy with your height?
[03:48.810 --> 03:49.610]  I'm happy with my height.
[03:49.770 --> 03:50.570]  How tall are you?
[03:50.730 --> 03:51.290]  Six foot tall.
[03:51.570 --> 03:52.350]  Yeah, it's a good height.
[03:52.570 --> 03:56.770]  If I were to stand up straight and I but which hasn't happened in years.
[03:56.870 --> 03:57.210]  But yeah.
[03:57.630 --> 03:57.990]  Huh.
[03:58.630 --> 03:59.670]  You think are you now?
[03:59.790 --> 04:00.710]  Are you legs or back?
[04:01.030 --> 04:02.450]  I feel like we've probably been over this.
[04:02.610 --> 04:06.150]  I'm I think I have a longer torso than normal, a little bit longer.
[04:06.310 --> 04:09.950]  And I think I'm like I could I would if I could change anything about me
[04:09.950 --> 04:11.830]  other than my personality and my face
[04:12.790 --> 04:17.950]  and how strong and fast I am and like everything from the neck up,
[04:17.990 --> 04:19.670]  I would I'd make my legs a little longer.
[04:19.750 --> 04:22.410]  I feel like they could be longer, but I'm happy at six feet tall.
[04:23.330 --> 04:26.370]  Who's got the most bog standard proportions of all of us, do you think?
[04:26.370 --> 04:29.190]  You. Oh, yeah, me.
[04:29.870 --> 04:32.190]  Or Nick. Nick is such a regulation guy.
[04:32.310 --> 04:34.430]  I bet he has the most regulation proportions.
[04:35.110 --> 04:37.290]  I don't I don't I don't know about that.
[04:37.750 --> 04:40.170]  I feel like proportions for Nick would be.
[04:40.290 --> 04:41.450]  You think he's got stumpy legs?
[04:42.010 --> 04:45.250]  Because well, because he's all he's always wearing a mask.
[04:45.330 --> 04:48.010]  So I think it's tough to even judge his proportions.
[04:48.110 --> 04:50.970]  Well, I see him from time to time without the mask on at work.
[04:51.070 --> 04:55.090]  And he seems very well proportioned, if I'm being honest with you.
[04:55.090 --> 04:57.790]  Does he just walk around yelling, where's my face?
[04:57.950 --> 05:00.190]  When you see that, is this what I imagine?
[05:00.410 --> 05:02.230]  Yeah, if we make eye contact, he freaks out.
[05:02.370 --> 05:04.830]  He goes, ah, and he covers his he covers his face up with his hands.
[05:05.130 --> 05:06.590]  He goes, don't look at me. I'm hideous.
[05:08.770 --> 05:09.750]  Oh, my God, we just.
[05:14.050 --> 05:16.270]  Nick was typing, don't look at me, I'm hideous.
[05:16.290 --> 05:18.110]  As I was saying, don't look at me, I'm hideous.
[05:18.970 --> 05:20.890]  Ah, Jesus Christ, Nick, we're spending too much time together.
[05:21.630 --> 05:22.750]  I was thinking about something.
[05:23.090 --> 05:23.830]  What were you thinking about?
[05:23.830 --> 05:24.970]  I was thinking about fruit.
[05:26.550 --> 05:27.550]  Well, that makes sense.
[05:27.670 --> 05:29.090]  You've consumed a lot of it recently.
[05:29.130 --> 05:30.710]  Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about fruit. Right.
[05:31.270 --> 05:32.630]  And I'm thinking about us and fruit.
[05:33.050 --> 05:37.530]  We've been we've been a fruit podcast since way back in apples. Right.
[05:37.550 --> 05:39.950]  So we're talking very early on.
[05:40.950 --> 05:44.910]  I think maybe, especially given the last few episodes,
[05:45.090 --> 05:51.070]  I think maybe we want to declare I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to
[05:52.710 --> 05:55.510]  requisition that we are I'm going to request, rather,
[05:55.690 --> 06:00.010]  I'm going to request that we put a temporary moratorium on fruit
[06:00.010 --> 06:01.690]  and fruit related content.
[06:01.830 --> 06:05.810]  I think maybe maybe we've hit the fruit enough for a little while.
[06:06.030 --> 06:08.570]  Maybe we should like pivot into something like
[06:09.270 --> 06:11.430]  we've barely scratched the surface on vegetables.
[06:11.930 --> 06:13.410]  Like I don't. That's true.
[06:13.690 --> 06:15.690]  Do we know do new vegetables drop?
[06:15.810 --> 06:19.330]  Is there like a new that's a that is such a great point?
[06:19.550 --> 06:20.950]  Is there a new pumpkin drop in this year?
[06:20.950 --> 06:22.250]  We don't even know because we're not.
[06:22.470 --> 06:25.930]  No. So focused on fruit and fruit based activities
[06:25.930 --> 06:30.170]  that we're not paying attention to cucumbers and gourds and potatoes.
[06:31.050 --> 06:33.090]  And wow. And rude about anything.
[06:33.310 --> 06:36.770]  Like, oh, there's a whole other world of vegetables that we're not.
[06:36.870 --> 06:38.630]  Corn. What's going on with corn?
[06:38.650 --> 06:43.670]  I don't know. I I've never been less on board and more on board.
[06:43.750 --> 06:45.230]  The idea that there's a new potato.
[06:45.230 --> 06:46.810]  I got to fucking know about that.
[06:46.830 --> 06:49.310]  If there's a new potato, we got to try potatoes.
[06:49.310 --> 06:51.990]  There's so many different kinds of potatoes.
[06:52.730 --> 06:54.290]  Really? Oh, my God.
[06:54.410 --> 06:58.870]  Peru alone grows like a hundred different kinds of potatoes.
[06:59.190 --> 07:01.950]  It's serious. So much potato tomatoes.
[07:02.010 --> 07:02.650]  There's a million.
[07:02.750 --> 07:04.870]  Oh, my God. How many different potatoes?
[07:05.190 --> 07:07.970]  How many kinds of potatoes?
[07:08.210 --> 07:10.630]  Now, when you started this, Geoff, it was like four thousand.
[07:10.930 --> 07:12.750]  Sorry. You there's four thousand.
[07:13.050 --> 07:14.410]  Oh, my God. I am.
[07:14.970 --> 07:17.690]  I want to go to a grocery store right now and see what I could find.
[07:17.690 --> 07:21.850]  There's one thousand bananas on a bag of chips that are each a different potato.
[07:24.810 --> 07:26.710]  Oh, now that's fascinating.
[07:27.310 --> 07:28.230]  Yeah, I wonder.
[07:28.490 --> 07:33.190]  Well, there's probably like a standard right of like what potato best cuts
[07:33.190 --> 07:35.650]  and like cooks correctly for what they want to go for.
[07:35.830 --> 07:40.770]  I wonder if like a standard chip is a different potato on average
[07:40.770 --> 07:44.970]  as opposed to like a kettle chip because it's a different process.
[07:45.110 --> 07:45.950]  That's a good question.
[07:45.950 --> 07:49.670]  I think most potato chips are bought like they come.
[07:49.810 --> 07:54.030]  I would say there's a lot of obviously a lot of different kinds of potatoes.
[07:54.190 --> 07:54.930]  There's four thousand. Right.
[07:55.090 --> 07:56.610]  But there's a lot that you're even familiar with.
[07:56.810 --> 07:59.170]  But I would say like the most bog standard
[08:00.290 --> 08:02.650]  regulation potato would probably be a russet potato.
[08:02.650 --> 08:05.590]  And I think that's what most potato chips are made out of as well.
[08:07.930 --> 08:09.970]  This is a whole this is I'm
[08:10.630 --> 08:13.950]  I kind of regret that we're doing two today because I want to go do some research.
[08:13.950 --> 08:15.070]  I want to be prepared.
[08:15.070 --> 08:16.850]  I'm not going to have time to do notes.
[08:17.330 --> 08:20.590]  Well, we can allocate you a special 10 minutes between recordings.
[08:20.590 --> 08:23.070]  If you want to do research, I need more time for potatoes.
[08:23.310 --> 08:27.090]  You got to really take your time with a high quality vegetable like that.
[08:27.190 --> 08:30.250]  Oh, dude, though, speaking of chips, the chips are here.
[08:30.330 --> 08:31.450]  We got it. I got the chips.
[08:31.470 --> 08:33.510]  It's all ready. Everyone has their chips.
[08:34.210 --> 08:36.830]  Do you want to know how dumb we are, Gavin?
[08:36.990 --> 08:38.530]  Just as a collective? Sure.
[08:38.790 --> 08:42.810]  The big trouble has been for getting me the last of Geoff's chips.
[08:42.810 --> 08:45.890]  That has been the thing that has been putting this on hold for a long time.
[08:46.410 --> 08:47.590]  Eric sent me a list of all the chips.
[08:47.930 --> 08:52.270]  I did my best to try to find places that would mail them at non insane prices.
[08:52.990 --> 08:54.190]  We went back and forth.
[08:54.370 --> 08:57.870]  I sent him a link to a place that appeared like it would ship to me.
[08:58.270 --> 08:59.750]  In fact, they wouldn't ship to Canada.
[09:00.070 --> 09:01.170]  It caused this whole delay.
[09:01.230 --> 09:02.250]  I'm sure it was a massive headache.
[09:02.650 --> 09:04.490]  We're then trying to figure out a new place.
[09:04.770 --> 09:07.690]  And this is after maybe three or four weeks of this process.
[09:07.810 --> 09:09.110]  It was like we were trying.
[09:09.650 --> 09:10.850]  I had the realization.
[09:11.370 --> 09:12.190]  Wait a second.
[09:12.750 --> 09:14.150]  Eric lives in America.
[09:14.510 --> 09:15.850]  These are Geoff's chips.
[09:16.430 --> 09:20.010]  Eric certainly could just go to any grocery store,
[09:20.370 --> 09:22.190]  buy these and then have that.
[09:22.510 --> 09:23.790]  We've been saying that for two months.
[09:23.850 --> 09:24.630]  What are you talking about?
[09:24.990 --> 09:27.270]  We didn't consider that until.
[09:27.350 --> 09:28.730]  What do you mean we didn't consider that?
[09:29.310 --> 09:30.250]  That was not.
[09:30.690 --> 09:32.770]  That came into consideration 10 days ago.
[09:33.150 --> 09:37.790]  Considering that I created my list by going to H-E-B
[09:37.790 --> 09:39.250]  and just going to the chip aisle.
[09:39.250 --> 09:41.450]  I also keep shipping you shit.
[09:41.770 --> 09:44.750]  It's it's expensive, but it's easy.
[09:44.950 --> 09:46.910]  We could have done this months ago, Eric.
[09:47.110 --> 09:48.690]  Why didn't you just ship them the chips then?
[09:48.950 --> 09:50.170]  That's kind of you, I think.
[09:50.310 --> 09:51.190]  You could have shipped them with Norm.
[09:51.670 --> 09:53.730]  Yeah, I mean, if anything, this is kind of on you, man.
[09:53.930 --> 09:56.570]  This is kind of, honestly, like what a hold up.
[09:57.070 --> 09:58.610]  I'm really excited about the crisps.
[09:58.930 --> 10:01.330]  Gavin had the solution this whole time and he was gatekeeping.
[10:01.330 --> 10:03.910]  And he kept it to himself, which is the weirdest part.
[10:04.190 --> 10:06.170]  Like, I don't know why you would keep it to yourself.
[10:06.350 --> 10:07.030]  That just seems weird.
[10:07.030 --> 10:10.170]  Whenever you were like, everything's there except for Geoff's.
[10:10.270 --> 10:11.310]  I was like, huh?
[10:11.730 --> 10:14.090]  We talk like my ones are the difficult ones.
[10:14.130 --> 10:15.850]  And we've had you've had those for ages.
[10:16.330 --> 10:17.110]  No, yours were easy.
[10:17.670 --> 10:18.370]  Ah, I'll be right back.
[10:18.370 --> 10:19.110]  Yours were really easy.
[10:19.610 --> 10:20.230]  The thing. All right.
[10:20.750 --> 10:24.750]  Well, the thing with some Geoff selections is if you're if you're a big chip head,
[10:25.230 --> 10:27.710]  they are considered some high quality chips.
[10:28.010 --> 10:31.130]  So it's tough to import them to other places because there's demand.
[10:31.890 --> 10:35.770]  I I'm kind of prepared for the chip draft.
[10:35.770 --> 10:37.950]  I'm not a draft, but like the chip off, I guess.
[10:38.130 --> 10:39.690]  Yeah, I'm the taste of. Yeah.
[10:39.930 --> 10:42.570]  Also, I've well, actually, I haven't finished.
[10:42.650 --> 10:46.310]  I would have finished if we weren't waiting for Andrew for half an hour before this.
[10:46.590 --> 10:49.150]  But the strumming video is almost done.
[10:49.310 --> 10:52.730]  Oh, awesome. I'll have you cut by the end of the day.
[10:53.070 --> 10:55.890]  We have a lot of stuff coming out on all of these,
[10:56.470 --> 10:58.030]  all of our channels and everything.
[10:58.190 --> 11:00.830]  And Geoff would be able to speak with this if he was here.
[11:01.110 --> 11:02.550]  I'm here. Oh, great. You're back.
[11:02.870 --> 11:04.270]  I announced when I got back.
[11:04.270 --> 11:06.390]  I did. Did anyone hear him say I'm back?
[11:06.930 --> 11:07.990]  No, he didn't.
[11:08.850 --> 11:12.090]  So Nickle here in this podcast called So All Right,
[11:12.370 --> 11:14.110]  which has just come out this week.
[11:14.890 --> 11:16.650]  You can go talk about this last week.
[11:16.730 --> 11:18.310]  Yes. We are hard on for this podcast.
[11:18.610 --> 11:19.870]  Yeah. Why are we doing this again?
[11:20.510 --> 11:21.550]  Because it's out now.
[11:21.950 --> 11:23.370]  OK. Yeah. But Geoff voted no.
[11:23.630 --> 11:26.730]  I mean, if Eric's got his dick all hard about my podcast,
[11:26.830 --> 11:29.490]  I'm not going to stop him from fucking talking about it.
[11:29.490 --> 11:32.610]  I can be done. Nick, for some reason, Nick, for some reason, is listed
[11:32.610 --> 11:33.850]  as the producer.
[11:34.150 --> 11:37.510]  And we're in all these meetings and they go, Nick, are you producing this?
[11:37.530 --> 11:39.970]  And he goes, I don't I don't think so.
[11:39.970 --> 11:42.670]  And yeah, we don't really know what's happening.
[11:42.810 --> 11:45.610]  I'm trying to make it a spreadsheet into a job.
[11:45.730 --> 11:48.050]  Hey, hey, Gavin, that's exactly what happened.
[11:48.170 --> 11:51.390]  For the record, I'm trying to make this as easy on Nick as humanly possible.
[11:51.550 --> 11:52.830]  I edit it myself.
[11:53.090 --> 11:56.090]  Then I just give him a file and then I just he just adds me.
[11:56.150 --> 11:57.650]  Well, I'm not I'm not trying to diminish what he does,
[11:57.810 --> 12:00.810]  but I edit all the content myself because it's just me talking
[12:00.810 --> 12:02.090]  and I do multiple takes and stuff.
[12:02.190 --> 12:03.430]  So I know how I want it to sound.
[12:03.890 --> 12:06.870]  So instead of leaving that for him to try to like that mess for him
[12:06.870 --> 12:09.550]  to try to put together, I try to give him a complete file
[12:09.550 --> 12:13.030]  that then he can, you know, normalize audio and then add some bumpers
[12:13.030 --> 12:15.690]  and, you know, a little bit of audio texture here and there.
[12:15.870 --> 12:18.350]  But I'm trying to make I'm trying to make it as easy as possible
[12:18.350 --> 12:19.850]  for Nick to produce this podcast.
[12:21.210 --> 12:24.190]  Would you say you're happy with the podcast so far? Me?
[12:24.830 --> 12:25.970]  Yeah, I think so.
[12:26.010 --> 12:28.490]  I've recorded six now and I've released zero.
[12:29.070 --> 12:34.950]  Um, I've fully edited five of the six and I only had to rerecord one
[12:34.950 --> 12:36.570]  and I haven't tried to kill myself yet.
[12:36.650 --> 12:40.110]  So that's good. Think that's a positive dude.
[12:40.390 --> 12:43.650]  Fucking. Yeah, it's been pretty good.
[12:43.770 --> 12:46.150]  Speaking of like not trying to kill myself.
[12:46.170 --> 12:49.610]  Is anybody else just really happy all the time right now?
[12:51.570 --> 12:54.690]  Yeah, you're describing like mania.
[12:55.550 --> 12:56.690]  I don't think so.
[12:56.690 --> 13:00.330]  I I think what it is, I understand why you would think that.
[13:01.110 --> 13:03.010]  But right. Just based on your description.
[13:03.590 --> 13:05.590]  Well, mania comes in waves, doesn't it?
[13:05.630 --> 13:09.030]  I think he's talking about like a consistent it's it's mania.
[13:09.210 --> 13:11.710]  And I'm trying to think of what was happening right before the mania.
[13:11.970 --> 13:15.930]  Was it like a severe depressive episode where he was hating himself
[13:15.930 --> 13:16.710]  for a long time?
[13:16.830 --> 13:18.530]  Those things can't certainly be hand in hand.
[13:18.810 --> 13:21.390]  I think the summer of 98 is really rubbing off on the group.
[13:21.430 --> 13:24.130]  I think I get all the vibes of the summer of 98.
[13:24.610 --> 13:26.590]  Have you visited pound town recently?
[13:27.610 --> 13:31.210]  Here's the deal with my depressive state from those recordings, Eric,
[13:31.350 --> 13:33.290]  is because I was right.
[13:33.470 --> 13:36.870]  I have gone back and listened to those episodes and I'm not phenomenal in them.
[13:37.210 --> 13:40.910]  And my harshest critic, who's also my biggest supporter, Emily,
[13:41.110 --> 13:43.330]  has confirmed that I was off in those episodes.
[13:43.410 --> 13:45.330]  And she's like, oh, yeah, I see what you're talking about.
[13:45.370 --> 13:45.810]  You're not great.
[13:46.030 --> 13:50.290]  So like I know I know I was right to be bummed about my performance.
[13:50.290 --> 13:55.230]  Uh, we also I thought last week was a phenomenal episode
[13:55.230 --> 13:56.490]  and I was happy with my performance.
[13:56.590 --> 14:00.410]  But I think the reason I'm so excited about it lately is because we
[14:00.970 --> 14:07.130]  we've been doing so much lately for the face and like the face umbrella.
[14:07.270 --> 14:09.110]  We've got so we've we've got it worked out.
[14:09.450 --> 14:11.030]  You know, there's stuff that we're working on behind the scenes,
[14:11.090 --> 14:14.510]  stuff that we've talked a little bit about here and there, like face off
[14:14.510 --> 14:15.530]  and some other stuff we've got going.
[14:15.730 --> 14:18.730]  But we're making a lot of content in the background right now.
[14:18.730 --> 14:23.350]  And it's getting to a point where it's we almost have
[14:23.990 --> 14:27.790]  we will almost have a piece of content a day, Monday through Friday.
[14:28.770 --> 14:30.930]  And I just am jazzed about that.
[14:31.090 --> 14:33.690]  Like it's like Gavin always talks about how he has trouble
[14:33.690 --> 14:35.550]  sleeping the night before an episode. I do, too.
[14:35.630 --> 14:37.610]  And then we're just like walking around our houses,
[14:37.750 --> 14:39.630]  like fucking vibrating before we record the podcast.
[14:39.870 --> 14:43.330]  I'm waking up like that every day right now because every day.
[14:43.590 --> 14:47.090]  Dude, I slept like dog shit last night because you're excited about this.
[14:47.090 --> 14:47.850]  Oh, it's a shock.
[14:48.170 --> 14:50.710]  Well, it was mainly because my phone started going ape shit.
[14:50.810 --> 14:51.870]  I got a blue alert.
[14:52.450 --> 14:56.490]  I guess some cop got shot in Houston
[14:56.490 --> 15:00.550]  and they decided that I should wake up at 5 a.m. to hear about it.
[15:00.730 --> 15:02.030]  You know, I didn't get that blue alert.
[15:02.290 --> 15:04.590]  They sent like three alerts about it, too.
[15:04.730 --> 15:05.570]  It was crazy.
[15:05.870 --> 15:07.610]  Everybody was complaining about it on Reddit.
[15:07.870 --> 15:08.950]  Yeah, I didn't get a single one.
[15:09.590 --> 15:12.230]  I mean, I'm fine with being on the lookout,
[15:12.410 --> 15:14.110]  but I think at 5 a.m. is a little much.
[15:14.110 --> 15:14.990]  And in Houston.
[15:15.310 --> 15:16.150]  In Houston.
[15:16.590 --> 15:17.610]  What's what am I going to do?
[15:17.730 --> 15:19.050]  Drive there? Get real.
[15:19.370 --> 15:21.570]  It overrides the whole do not disturb thing.
[15:22.270 --> 15:22.810]  It does.
[15:23.350 --> 15:26.850]  I thought you're calling me out because I texted you at like 4 a.m.
[15:26.850 --> 15:28.010]  because I could not sleep.
[15:28.110 --> 15:29.630]  And I was like, I need to get in the lab.
[15:30.490 --> 15:32.390]  We've been doing this for like three years.
[15:32.670 --> 15:34.050]  I need to figure this shit out.
[15:34.190 --> 15:36.110]  Yeah, that didn't buzz my phone with the sound going.
[15:37.250 --> 15:39.670]  I don't know what sound that whatever you just did.
[15:39.730 --> 15:41.070]  Yeah, I didn't know if there was a sound.
[15:41.130 --> 15:41.730]  We didn't hear it.
[15:41.730 --> 15:44.250]  You are the worst at conveying sounds.
[15:44.750 --> 15:47.130]  Whenever I make a noise, my Discord just shuts me up.
[15:47.530 --> 15:48.610]  Yeah, this is no.
[15:49.270 --> 15:50.690]  You can turn that off, can't you?
[15:51.090 --> 15:52.490]  I made a horrible sound.
[15:53.190 --> 15:55.050]  I believe you. I trust it.
[15:56.190 --> 15:58.690]  Like, was it like a like a...
[15:59.270 --> 16:00.130]  Was it like that?
[16:00.390 --> 16:00.850]  What type of sound?
[16:00.930 --> 16:01.910]  You're not far off.
[16:02.050 --> 16:03.490]  How come I can hear his sounds?
[16:04.330 --> 16:06.730]  Because he has a good noise suppression.
[16:07.470 --> 16:08.270]  Yeah, it's...
[16:08.770 --> 16:10.590]  Well, I have a fan on, so I assume you'd hear that
[16:10.590 --> 16:11.810]  if my noise suppression was off.
[16:12.330 --> 16:12.590]  Yeah.
[16:13.810 --> 16:15.650]  Well, you could turn the fan off, I assume.
[16:16.030 --> 16:18.650]  Although maybe it's essential for your air.
[16:19.090 --> 16:20.170]  Is it an air thing?
[16:20.330 --> 16:22.570]  Well, yeah, I got to blow the carbon dioxide away from me and the cats.
[16:23.890 --> 16:26.910]  It's all the cat breath is just laying right on top of him.
[16:27.110 --> 16:28.530]  He's got to get it away from him.
[16:29.370 --> 16:31.210]  Eric told me he's a he's a Smee fan.
[16:31.870 --> 16:34.510]  Oh, I decided that I like Gavin's insane cat.
[16:34.950 --> 16:35.990]  Yeah. Yeah.
[16:36.150 --> 16:37.950]  What was the thing that made you...
[16:37.950 --> 16:41.110]  I just I've just heard so many stories about the insane cat
[16:41.110 --> 16:43.530]  that I've decided that I'm a big Smee fan.
[16:43.690 --> 16:45.230]  Do you think you'll hold him next time you come over?
[16:45.450 --> 16:48.970]  No, because I think he'll like he'll like physically harm me in a way
[16:48.970 --> 16:51.550]  that will be like not funny to me anymore.
[16:53.190 --> 16:57.150]  I think you described him as like, imagine if a cat could bite you
[16:57.150 --> 16:59.770]  as hard as it can and like what that feels like,
[17:00.110 --> 17:01.650]  because that's what he does every time.
[17:01.850 --> 17:03.110]  And it's like, oh, that's terrifying.
[17:03.210 --> 17:04.470]  That's like really scary to me.
[17:04.990 --> 17:08.650]  Oh, speaking of Smee, Andrew, Eric, and you may not be aware of this.
[17:08.830 --> 17:11.410]  Eric and I have taken up residence in Gavin's pool
[17:12.490 --> 17:15.630]  for every Saturday from here on until we die.
[17:15.770 --> 17:17.730]  OK, really? Yeah. Yeah.
[17:17.730 --> 17:19.730]  We just have we just have we're just there now.
[17:19.810 --> 17:22.770]  This will be the third Saturday in a row we're making him let us come over.
[17:22.890 --> 17:24.470]  And I don't see any reason to stop.
[17:25.610 --> 17:27.530]  And Eric doesn't get in the pool, I assume.
[17:27.670 --> 17:30.310]  He's buying. Oh, I was the first one in the pool.
[17:30.790 --> 17:32.330]  Really? Yeah. Wow.
[17:33.030 --> 17:34.450]  It's a here's the thing.
[17:34.570 --> 17:39.870]  It's a very shallow pool and it's so hot outside.
[17:40.030 --> 17:41.650]  There is no choice.
[17:44.150 --> 17:48.230]  You you have to get in the water, which is warm.
[17:48.470 --> 17:51.250]  It will in the bath is what it feels like. Yeah.
[17:51.850 --> 17:55.270]  When when you said shallow pool, my mind immediately goes to like
[17:55.270 --> 17:58.250]  one of those kiddie plastic pools you would buy at like Walmart.
[17:58.470 --> 18:01.950]  I'm just imagining all of you and the child pool just standing
[18:01.950 --> 18:03.370]  with our jeans rolled up.
[18:03.570 --> 18:04.830]  Yeah. Yeah. Mm hmm.
[18:05.390 --> 18:06.630]  It's this is a great time.
[18:06.870 --> 18:09.930]  Every weekend we show up and stand in Gavin's kiddie pool.
[18:10.410 --> 18:13.130]  Every every Saturday we stand in Gavin's kiddie pool and drink liquid.
[18:13.730 --> 18:15.010]  Yeah. A lot of fun.
[18:15.730 --> 18:16.370]  It's a good tradition.
[18:16.490 --> 18:17.150]  A real tradition.
[18:18.230 --> 18:20.890]  I speaking of happy, I agree, Geoff.
[18:20.930 --> 18:23.750]  I've also been I feel very happy recently.
[18:23.890 --> 18:25.810]  I'm excited about all the stuff we have going on.
[18:26.730 --> 18:31.550]  I not to take it to too morbid of a place, but I had a realization
[18:32.030 --> 18:35.190]  that has brought me a lot of joy these last few days.
[18:35.790 --> 18:38.590]  I was talking to Gracie, who is a producer on the show.
[18:38.970 --> 18:40.450]  Helps with like social clips and stuff.
[18:40.630 --> 18:42.070]  They were the voice that said,
[18:43.190 --> 18:45.010]  is this show happening or whatever?
[18:45.150 --> 18:47.930]  A few weeks ago, I saw people confused as to who that voice was,
[18:48.410 --> 18:50.610]  which when I was having technical difficulties,
[18:51.050 --> 18:54.430]  there was a post in the subreddit that just said, who was that woman?
[18:57.590 --> 18:59.170]  It's great. It was fantastic.
[18:59.290 --> 19:00.810]  But I was having a conversation with Gracie
[19:00.810 --> 19:05.170]  and I had this thought that I've never considered about
[19:05.890 --> 19:08.650]  what I will look like on paper
[19:09.230 --> 19:12.670]  to future generations of people in my family,
[19:13.270 --> 19:15.650]  like six generations or whatever from now.
[19:15.810 --> 19:19.550]  Somebody is going to look back at their family tree
[19:19.550 --> 19:24.070]  and realize they're related to the Garfield cart spaghetti guy.
[19:24.710 --> 19:29.070]  And it just brings me so much joy to know the disappointment and fear
[19:29.070 --> 19:34.210]  they will probably have looking at me on paper and what I have accomplished.
[19:34.690 --> 19:35.710]  Here's what you need to do.
[19:36.130 --> 19:41.550]  Maybe we should all do this to secure the longevity of of our memory
[19:41.550 --> 19:45.330]  and and I don't know our accomplishments.
[19:45.670 --> 19:49.330]  I think you should get one of those old timey paintings that people
[19:49.850 --> 19:54.050]  where you're like standing in a suit looking like looking like three
[19:54.050 --> 19:58.490]  quarter off and you look very debonair and it's like giant.
[19:58.490 --> 20:02.430]  And usually like in a great library above somebody's big fireplace.
[20:02.790 --> 20:05.130]  I think we should commission and get one of those made.
[20:05.470 --> 20:06.950]  Then it becomes a family heirloom.
[20:07.090 --> 20:10.150]  And then your family is required to pass it down from age to age
[20:10.150 --> 20:11.290]  and hang it up in a house.
[20:11.350 --> 20:13.850]  So people will always be aware of you.
[20:13.930 --> 20:16.590]  You'll be omnipresent for every generation to come.
[20:17.470 --> 20:19.390]  And I think we probably all deserve that.
[20:19.450 --> 20:20.430]  I think we should get five of them.
[20:20.510 --> 20:21.350]  I think that's really funny.
[20:21.430 --> 20:24.890]  Eric just posted the photo of Tony Soprano with the horse, which yes, I love.
[20:25.050 --> 20:27.810]  Yes, that is like the idea. Exactly.
[20:27.810 --> 20:31.630]  Is it vandalism to put a balaclava on a statue?
[20:33.290 --> 20:35.270]  That's a great question.
[20:35.670 --> 20:39.770]  And if because did you have that thing in in in your towns growing up
[20:39.770 --> 20:43.230]  where if there was a statue, everyone would climb them and put condoms on the fingers?
[20:45.310 --> 20:46.910]  Not specifically that.
[20:46.990 --> 20:51.150]  Yeah, like I pretty much every every statue in England of someone pointing
[20:51.150 --> 20:52.430]  they've got a Johnny on their thing.
[20:52.890 --> 20:56.550]  Was there a rash of of like British statue
[20:57.010 --> 20:57.990]  pregnancies in the 80s?
[20:59.510 --> 21:02.530]  No, people just people just want them to be protected, I guess.
[21:02.590 --> 21:03.510]  I guess whatever could happen.
[21:04.690 --> 21:07.650]  I think that if you want to find out if it's vandalism
[21:07.650 --> 21:11.790]  to put a balaclava on a statue, get the Andrew Pantin one.
[21:12.170 --> 21:16.550]  I just want to see how many Andrews take a picture and tweet it at us.
[21:16.670 --> 21:18.410]  No, you shouldn't do that. You get arrested for it.
[21:18.470 --> 21:20.350]  Right. Right. Don't right.
[21:20.370 --> 21:21.290]  We're not condoning it.
[21:21.330 --> 21:24.070]  But if you happen to do it and send a picture, that would be interesting.
[21:24.090 --> 21:25.070]  And we'd love to see it.
[21:25.070 --> 21:28.510]  But only if you happen to run across it and you do it yourself.
[21:28.870 --> 21:31.930]  And if you happen to spot the person who did it and they take it down
[21:31.930 --> 21:33.630]  immediately after the picture, that's probably fine.
[21:33.890 --> 21:35.150]  But also don't do it.
[21:35.190 --> 21:37.490]  Yeah, don't do it. Don't listen to them.
[21:37.810 --> 21:38.310]  Just don't do it.
[21:38.450 --> 21:43.250]  Do we have the budget, Eric, to make a very large one of those
[21:43.250 --> 21:47.210]  and then maybe somehow get it on the Statue of Liberty?
[21:48.010 --> 21:51.770]  That you're asking if this show, this podcast that we couldn't send
[21:52.460 --> 21:55.630]  has the budget to put a mask on the Statue of Liberty.
[21:56.010 --> 21:57.770]  The chips wasn't a financial issue.
[21:57.890 --> 21:59.110]  That was an IQ problem.
[21:59.530 --> 22:00.130]  Good idea.
[22:00.410 --> 22:04.050]  I will say chips was also a financial issue because do you know how much it is
[22:04.050 --> 22:07.350]  to ship just trying to get stuff to Canada?
[22:07.610 --> 22:09.970]  Oh, my God. It was like fifty dollars.
[22:10.170 --> 22:12.710]  It's yeah, it was fifty five bucks for that DVD set.
[22:13.130 --> 22:16.490]  Hey, guys, I think I've I think we've stumbled on a new business model.
[22:16.790 --> 22:17.650]  Ship a chip.
[22:18.490 --> 22:21.510]  How to covertly and cheaply ship chips to Canada.
[22:21.770 --> 22:22.710]  From the United States.
[22:22.970 --> 22:25.170]  And what makes them cheaper than anything else?
[22:25.510 --> 22:27.310]  I don't know. We'll have to figure that part out.
[22:27.610 --> 22:29.590]  I can't answer every question all at once.
[22:29.650 --> 22:31.330]  I've given you step one and I've given you profit.
[22:31.550 --> 22:34.670]  You're going to have to put some fucking effort to come up with steps two and three.
[22:35.090 --> 22:38.190]  I don't know if a as a Rooster Teeth affiliate, we are qualified
[22:38.190 --> 22:41.690]  to conduct in low shipping for overseas ventures.
[22:42.590 --> 22:44.650]  They make it their way hard.
[22:44.890 --> 22:49.310]  We can incorporate this with like, thank me later, like where I buy chips,
[22:49.870 --> 22:53.010]  but I don't want them for several months internationally.
[22:53.550 --> 22:56.290]  Yeah, it's called it's called what the fuck?
[22:56.510 --> 23:00.290]  And it just charges you the insane shipping costs sometime randomly.
[23:00.370 --> 23:03.590]  And you just look at your statement and go, what the fuck?
[23:03.610 --> 23:05.330]  What was that? Where did that?
[23:05.450 --> 23:06.810]  Where did all my money go?
[23:07.730 --> 23:09.950]  It's like it's thank me later.
[23:09.950 --> 23:12.730]  Plus comes with what the fuck. Buy a chip.
[23:12.870 --> 23:14.250]  I think you're saving money.
[23:14.890 --> 23:18.530]  But it's just it's giving it to you at some unannounced time.
[23:18.530 --> 23:20.250]  That's probably really inconvenient for you.
[23:20.310 --> 23:22.490]  It's the exact opposite spirit of thank me later.
[23:22.610 --> 23:24.550]  Is it the opposite than a bag of ketchup chip?
[23:24.770 --> 23:28.250]  Yeah, because thank me later is about the joy of receiving a thing
[23:28.250 --> 23:32.610]  that you wanted and didn't expect it where what the fuck is receiving
[23:32.610 --> 23:36.710]  a thing you don't want, probably at a time in which you really don't need it to happen.
[23:36.890 --> 23:38.210]  Right. Hmm.
[23:38.670 --> 23:40.530]  So I think it's the exact opposite spirit.
[23:41.090 --> 23:42.270]  What the face?
[23:43.450 --> 23:45.550]  Whoa. Oh, now it's all connected.
[23:46.230 --> 23:48.250]  See, that's why you're in the names guy here, Geoff.
[23:48.710 --> 23:52.170]  Yeah, I'm the guy who helped come up with Rooster Teeth and Achievement Hunter.
[23:53.550 --> 23:56.170]  Don't listen to any of my naming ideas ever.
[23:56.650 --> 24:00.310]  I've been looking at everyone's official titles on Slack.
[24:01.190 --> 24:03.150]  We've got some yeah, we've got some good ones on here.
[24:03.190 --> 24:05.890]  We've got well, Eric is director of broadcast.
[24:06.330 --> 24:09.710]  I don't think I've been that for eight or nine months now.
[24:09.890 --> 24:11.310]  Nick is director of audio production.
[24:11.570 --> 24:13.290]  We got a co-founder is Geoff.
[24:13.930 --> 24:15.650]  Andrew is Face Achievement Hunter.
[24:15.650 --> 24:18.230]  And I'm obviously the chancellor of the Exchequer.
[24:18.770 --> 24:24.570]  But I noticed that Gracie's one F Brands.
[24:24.690 --> 24:27.690]  What is that like? Is that the face jam and face?
[24:28.130 --> 24:32.630]  Yeah. Let me explain to you what the F Brands are and why we're a company
[24:32.630 --> 24:34.030]  that's never named something well.
[24:34.990 --> 24:36.910]  What's what's F Brands?
[24:37.070 --> 24:40.970]  F Brands is the thing that I channel manage that I oversee.
[24:41.230 --> 24:44.390]  I oversee Face.
[24:44.390 --> 24:46.330]  Yeah, I oversee Face Jam.
[24:46.570 --> 24:50.170]  And for my final F Brand, it's Anma.
[24:51.090 --> 24:53.170]  All right. Yeah.
[24:53.730 --> 24:57.570]  So you figure that out because I still can't.
[24:57.590 --> 25:01.530]  Gracie, can you change your title to Line Producer E Brands?
[25:01.850 --> 25:03.810]  It's basically any brand that Eric runs.
[25:05.270 --> 25:06.730]  Why do we call it F Brands?
[25:06.750 --> 25:07.750]  Why we just call it E Brands?
[25:07.810 --> 25:09.830]  I don't know. I don't know.
[25:09.830 --> 25:14.690]  To me, it just looks like I don't want to put F Face as my job title.
[25:14.710 --> 25:17.610]  No, F Brands is the thing because it's Face Jam also.
[25:17.830 --> 25:19.910]  And then I keep and then it's at the beginning of all this.
[25:19.990 --> 25:21.650]  I went, what's Anma? Right.
[25:22.090 --> 25:24.550]  And I go, right. But like, we'll just call it F Brands.
[25:24.630 --> 25:25.450]  And I just go, it's fine.
[25:25.450 --> 25:27.590]  As long as it's not public facing, it doesn't matter.
[25:27.910 --> 25:30.490]  So anyway, now it's public facing. Thank you so much.
[25:30.790 --> 25:33.790]  I will say there are a lot of people in the company
[25:33.790 --> 25:38.010]  who don't like to say F Face and they refer to it as F Face.
[25:38.010 --> 25:42.810]  And so I feel like it's to provide cover also for some people
[25:42.810 --> 25:46.310]  who just aren't comfortable with with some of the, you know.
[25:46.530 --> 25:48.550]  Do you think maybe some of those people work for the wrong company?
[25:50.430 --> 25:52.950]  Do I think that? I couldn't say.
[25:53.230 --> 25:55.970]  OK, no, I don't. I really don't.
[25:56.750 --> 25:59.970]  I have also, mine says co-founder and comma other things.
[26:00.110 --> 26:00.990]  I don't know what that means.
[26:01.870 --> 26:02.670]  Who puts those there?
[26:02.690 --> 26:03.770]  Well, some of the F Brands.
[26:03.870 --> 26:05.910]  You do. You put those there.
[26:06.430 --> 26:07.090]  You should know.
[26:07.730 --> 26:10.490]  Also, I was, you know, Achievement Hunter, Rooster Teeth.
[26:10.950 --> 26:13.570]  You know, I wasn't you're criticizing your name ability.
[26:13.790 --> 26:15.230]  But F Face as well.
[26:15.330 --> 26:17.150]  I mean, clearly you're great at this.
[26:17.390 --> 26:18.350]  I'm happy with F Face.
[26:19.430 --> 26:21.870]  I think it's it's a name.
[26:22.470 --> 26:23.630]  Thank you. I'll agree with that.
[26:24.970 --> 26:26.750]  We can't, you know, listen, like what?
[26:26.770 --> 26:28.650]  What is a good batting average in baseball?
[26:29.010 --> 26:30.730]  It's like less than 500 percent, right?
[26:30.950 --> 26:33.090]  300, 300. Yeah. Yeah.
[26:33.170 --> 26:33.810]  Like, yeah.
[26:34.210 --> 26:35.730]  I mean, you're swinging way above 300.
[26:36.330 --> 26:37.290]  Oh, thanks, man.
[26:37.510 --> 26:38.390]  I'll take that.
[26:38.490 --> 26:39.950]  In the name department, you're doing great.
[26:40.150 --> 26:41.570]  But have you? I'm curious.
[26:41.690 --> 26:45.470]  Like, have you ever thought about like how you will come across
[26:45.470 --> 26:47.790]  to other people that don't know you in the future?
[26:47.790 --> 26:49.350]  So I'm like, I'm getting the painting made.
[26:51.190 --> 26:54.890]  It just is like reshaped my view of how I do things.
[26:55.130 --> 26:58.970]  Like anytime there's a sleep spaghetti, I know I'm disappointing
[26:58.970 --> 27:02.330]  a future generation of my family, and it just makes it even funnier to me.
[27:02.330 --> 27:04.890]  Here, the reality like that is funny.
[27:04.990 --> 27:06.050]  That's a funny angle to take.
[27:06.470 --> 27:11.390]  But the reality is I don't give a fuck about what anybody thinks about me
[27:11.390 --> 27:14.730]  alive or dead or not living yet.
[27:14.730 --> 27:17.550]  Like, I'm never going to meet those people and have the opportunity
[27:17.550 --> 27:19.150]  to give them my side of the story.
[27:19.190 --> 27:21.190]  So fuck them. They can like me or not.
[27:21.390 --> 27:23.430]  We'll never our paths will never cross.
[27:23.490 --> 27:24.290]  They don't exist yet.
[27:24.770 --> 27:28.010]  To be clear, I don't care if they like me or dislike me.
[27:28.270 --> 27:29.930]  I just think it's hilarious.
[27:30.090 --> 27:31.170]  Like, it brings me joy.
[27:31.170 --> 27:32.910]  I will be dead, but I will.
[27:33.110 --> 27:37.790]  I'm laughing in my death at just knowing somebody is going to have to uncover
[27:37.790 --> 27:38.330]  all this shit.
[27:38.510 --> 27:42.130]  Well, why don't you leave a personalized message to little Steve?
[27:42.690 --> 27:44.330]  Six generations down from you.
[27:45.470 --> 27:46.790]  That would be really creepy
[27:46.790 --> 27:48.990]  if there was a little Steve six generations down.
[27:49.250 --> 27:49.830]  You never know, it could happen.
[27:50.250 --> 27:50.830]  It could.
[27:51.130 --> 27:54.230]  Do I just have to write like letters for a bunch of names and just see?
[27:54.670 --> 27:55.650]  You could just say it right now.
[27:55.670 --> 27:56.810]  You could just give a message to Steve.
[27:58.190 --> 28:00.290]  Ah, no, it's a lot of pressure.
[28:00.290 --> 28:00.950]  It's not.
[28:01.070 --> 28:01.890]  I listen, I will.
[28:02.110 --> 28:05.610]  I'll dedicate some terrible thing to little Steve in the future.
[28:05.670 --> 28:06.830]  OK, little Steve.
[28:07.110 --> 28:07.690]  What's the most?
[28:07.830 --> 28:09.770]  What are like the most popular names in the world?
[28:09.850 --> 28:12.150]  You could just like just cover that.
[28:12.950 --> 28:13.970]  David's true, John.
[28:14.430 --> 28:17.950]  But then there might be, you know, like Elmer was really big in like 1940.
[28:18.130 --> 28:19.390]  There's not a lot of Elmer's now.
[28:19.750 --> 28:21.010]  Yeah, it's come in and out.
[28:21.150 --> 28:21.790]  It'll come around.
[28:21.870 --> 28:23.010]  I'll be like Horace or something.
[28:23.430 --> 28:25.930]  Yeah, John.
[28:26.050 --> 28:29.170]  I bet you John is probably the most popular name of all time.
[28:29.170 --> 28:31.610]  What is the most popular name?
[28:31.990 --> 28:32.510]  Oh, Jesus.
[28:34.850 --> 28:38.610]  I think Maria is like the most popular name on Earth.
[28:38.650 --> 28:39.230]  It really?
[28:39.730 --> 28:40.290]  Yeah.
[28:40.650 --> 28:43.230]  I just, uh, yeah, yeah, I know.
[28:43.990 --> 28:45.990]  Gavin, what would you say to your future
[28:47.430 --> 28:47.990]  progeny?
[28:48.690 --> 28:50.210]  Uh, hello, little thing.
[28:50.550 --> 28:51.110]  All right.
[28:53.470 --> 28:54.430]  Hello there.
[28:55.270 --> 28:57.930]  Please, like, because he's in my head, he's three.
[28:58.410 --> 28:58.670]  So, OK.
[28:58.670 --> 29:05.610]  Oh, you guys are much nicer to future versions of you than I would be.
[29:05.850 --> 29:06.090]  Did your future...
[29:06.090 --> 29:07.630]  Like, here's what I would say.
[29:07.890 --> 29:10.430]  I'd say, hey, what the fuck are you doing with your life?
[29:10.490 --> 29:11.310]  Look at what I did.
[29:11.590 --> 29:12.430]  What are you doing?
[29:13.170 --> 29:15.350]  We, I built something here.
[29:15.590 --> 29:17.990]  Get your head out of your ass and work harder.
[29:18.170 --> 29:18.910]  Do some stuff.
[29:20.030 --> 29:23.890]  I like how you're scolding them for looking at what you did by saying, look what I did.
[29:25.390 --> 29:32.630]  Yeah, I'm saying if every, if everybody that comes after me isn't, is less successful than me, I think they're fucking losers.
[29:32.830 --> 29:36.270]  But if they're more successful than me, they're fucking braggy suckers.
[29:36.490 --> 29:39.870]  They've got to be exactly, they've got to be exactly as successful as I was.
[29:40.550 --> 29:44.950]  Yeah, it's like when you play video games and anyone better than you is like a no life loser.
[29:45.130 --> 29:48.650]  And anyone worse than you is like a...
[29:48.650 --> 29:49.410]  Yeah, exactly.
[29:49.410 --> 29:54.810]  It's really funny to me, the idea that little Steve is getting that message and then progresses to see what you did.
[29:54.870 --> 29:57.750]  And it's drink a bunch of fruit, make Kool-Aid.
[29:58.090 --> 29:58.730]  Dollars on fruit.
[29:59.990 --> 30:00.930]  I can do that.
[30:02.110 --> 30:09.830]  Get embarrassingly drunk on 10,000 hours of video footage and then, and then discover fruit.
[30:10.830 --> 30:11.470]  Oh, man.
[30:14.650 --> 30:17.190]  Oh, bloody Kent Nichols just text me.
[30:17.570 --> 30:18.290]  Oh, what'd he say?
[30:18.290 --> 30:19.970]  It's just talking about lenses and shit.
[30:20.150 --> 30:29.590]  It was funny when I saw him in Vegas, I said, I haven't spoken to you since Lockout, which was like a Halo 2 map, which I think was the last time I played Halo with him.
[30:29.910 --> 30:34.110]  It's funny, like remembering the last time I hung out with someone, but it was in a completely virtual world.
[30:34.610 --> 30:36.050]  Yeah, yeah, that's funny.
[30:37.470 --> 30:40.890]  Just Lock... well, wait, were you guys playing MCC or were you playing...
[30:40.890 --> 30:43.890]  Nah, talking like 2005 probably.
[30:44.750 --> 30:45.190]  Oh, wow.
[30:45.250 --> 30:46.890]  That might be the last time Kent played a video game.
[30:48.290 --> 30:49.050]  He's not a big gamer.

[32:19.450 --> 32:21.690]  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[32:22.110 --> 32:30.890]  There are times in life, certainly at least in my experience, where you have no idea what to do or you're faced with a problem where there just doesn't seem to be a good answer.
[32:31.010 --> 32:38.030]  And those are incredibly difficult and very valuable times to have people in your life that you can talk to about those issues.
[32:38.670 --> 32:40.590]  It's, I think, something we all experience.
[32:40.950 --> 32:50.530]  And even though sometimes it doesn't feel like there's a right answer, just being able to go through that experience and reflect on the other side, I think, is so important.
[32:50.990 --> 33:01.150]  Whether you're dealing with decisions around career, relationships or anything else, therapy helps you stay connected to what you really want while you navigate life so you can move forward with confidence and excitement.
[33:01.970 --> 33:05.090]  Trusting yourself to make decisions that align with your values is like anything.
[33:05.570 --> 33:07.790]  The more you practice it, the easier you get.
[33:08.490 --> 33:11.430]  Therapy is, I think, such an important process to go through.
[33:11.890 --> 33:15.230]  It has benefited my life tremendously in all sorts of ways.
[33:15.750 --> 33:34.150]  I've recently been trying to work on stuff relating to my anxiety and just having some conversations with people in that space have really opened up my eyes to certain things that I didn't even realize I needed to work through, which is so beneficial and important.
[33:34.150 --> 33:49.990]  I think that's why therapy is great, because not to get too deep into my own personal stuff, but to be like trying to fix a knee problem by doing stuff to your shoulder and just focusing on your shoulder, not even realizing that you have a knee issue to begin with.
[33:50.210 --> 34:02.190]  But through my process with therapy for what I'm kind of currently sorting through, it has allowed me to identify what really the problems are so I can begin to progress and figure that stuff out.
[34:02.190 --> 34:06.870]  And also just understand that, like, you always are going to be figuring stuff out.
[34:06.970 --> 34:08.510]  It's never it's never done.
[34:08.770 --> 34:13.810]  You have to constantly improve, or at least I would like to try to do that as a person.
[34:14.010 --> 34:19.530]  But anyhow, if you're thinking of starting therapy, give BetterHelp a try.

[36:24.950 --> 36:26.430]  I have an exciting update.
[36:26.430 --> 36:30.670]  I may have indirectly talking about family lineage.
[36:30.890 --> 36:37.550]  This podcast may have been discovered by somebody notable, someone famous, a famous.
[36:37.690 --> 36:40.110]  We've talked about famous people listening to the show before.
[36:40.470 --> 36:42.970]  I had something crazy happened.
[36:43.510 --> 36:44.570]  Crazy is maybe a strong word.
[36:45.110 --> 36:47.530]  My cousin got married.
[36:48.110 --> 36:53.190]  My cousin got married to the person who invented master class
[36:53.190 --> 36:58.150]  and they had like a big, like rich, whatever famous person wedding recently.
[36:58.490 --> 36:58.970]  Were you invited?
[36:59.550 --> 37:00.970]  I was not invited.
[37:01.130 --> 37:01.690]  No, sadly.
[37:03.030 --> 37:03.870]  It's not invited.
[37:04.050 --> 37:04.910]  That's a tough one, Geoff.
[37:05.050 --> 37:06.810]  I don't know. You immediately took a swing.
[37:07.370 --> 37:08.370]  I'm just asking.
[37:08.570 --> 37:09.110]  I'm just asking.
[37:09.310 --> 37:10.310]  Let's take it as a question.
[37:10.650 --> 37:12.810]  What cousin? First, second, third, fourth, eighth.
[37:12.910 --> 37:15.150]  I don't know what any of those things are.
[37:15.150 --> 37:15.890]  Are you close? What is?
[37:16.470 --> 37:18.570]  No. OK, but they're family.
[37:18.790 --> 37:19.550]  Similar age range.
[37:20.390 --> 37:21.690]  Yeah, relatively.
[37:21.690 --> 37:24.750]  You see him at like summer barbecues and get togethers
[37:24.750 --> 37:26.250]  and Christmas and Thanksgiving, that kind of thing.
[37:27.050 --> 37:31.890]  I probably haven't seen this cousin in like 16, 17 years.
[37:32.090 --> 37:32.990]  What's their favorite book?
[37:33.490 --> 37:37.810]  I don't know the answer to that question, but I'm sure I could find that out for you
[37:37.810 --> 37:38.570]  if you really want to know.
[37:38.650 --> 37:39.630]  I could try to get back in touch.
[37:40.050 --> 37:40.710]  OK, yeah, please do.
[37:40.790 --> 37:45.470]  Anyway, they had a wedding and at the table was Christina Aguilera,
[37:45.750 --> 37:46.950]  the family wedding or whatever.
[37:48.030 --> 37:50.590]  She's hanging out with them and
[37:51.690 --> 37:53.010]  they were they were talking.
[37:53.170 --> 37:53.810]  My uncle was talking.
[37:54.010 --> 37:56.450]  Now, nobody in my family knows anything about video games.
[37:56.830 --> 37:59.290]  So they're talking to Christina Aguilera, who's at this wedding,
[37:59.810 --> 38:01.730]  and they were just trying to make small talk.
[38:01.790 --> 38:04.630]  And they asked, like, what is your favorite thing to do?
[38:04.810 --> 38:06.150]  Like what in your off time?
[38:06.190 --> 38:06.910]  What do you enjoy doing?
[38:07.170 --> 38:11.410]  And apparently Christina Aguilera fucking loves Mario Kart.
[38:11.730 --> 38:12.790]  Super in the Mario Kart.
[38:12.870 --> 38:14.930]  They're like, it's all I play whenever I have free time.
[38:15.090 --> 38:16.350]  I play Mario Kart.
[38:16.630 --> 38:20.950]  My uncle unknowingly wasn't attempting to lie.
[38:21.470 --> 38:22.330]  Heard that.
[38:22.690 --> 38:26.010]  Knew my past history with Garfield Kart.
[38:26.390 --> 38:30.830]  Thought video game, kart game said to Christina Aguilera,
[38:31.510 --> 38:35.750]  that's my I have a nephew who's the best player in the world at that game.
[38:36.070 --> 38:40.650]  They have they have all of the best times
[38:40.650 --> 38:42.850]  in that game, in that Mario Kart game.
[38:43.910 --> 38:46.250]  Christina Aguilera was apparently very impressed by this,
[38:46.330 --> 38:49.570]  was very excited by this news, was like, who is he?
[38:49.570 --> 38:51.670]  My uncle gave them immediately wanted your info.
[38:51.810 --> 38:52.190]  Yeah, exactly.
[38:52.530 --> 38:55.690]  So I don't who knows if she ever followed through on that.
[38:55.750 --> 38:59.130]  But there is a possibility in which Christina Aguilera, for a brief time,
[38:59.350 --> 39:02.190]  thought that I was the best Mario Kart player in the world,
[39:02.470 --> 39:07.650]  looked me up and only discovered face and Garfield Kart 2.
[39:07.990 --> 39:09.610]  And that makes me really happy.
[39:09.910 --> 39:11.430]  Do you think she'll eventually challenge you?
[39:11.710 --> 39:12.890]  No, I don't think so.
[39:12.930 --> 39:15.450]  I don't think she's impressed by Garfield Kart 2, I'd assume.
[39:16.190 --> 39:17.490]  I should probably never tried it.
[39:18.390 --> 39:19.050]  That's true.
[39:19.390 --> 39:23.110]  That would rule if we just out of nowhere had a gaming video
[39:23.110 --> 39:28.050]  where you and Christina Aguilera were playing Mario Kart for some reason.
[39:28.450 --> 39:30.170]  I think her friends call her Xtina.
[39:31.010 --> 39:34.350]  Do you think do you think if you got really, really, really good times
[39:34.350 --> 39:37.410]  in Mario Kart now, you could get Christina Aguilera's attention?
[39:37.650 --> 39:39.590]  Like you like you're closer than you were before.
[39:39.710 --> 39:40.230]  You know what I mean?
[39:40.430 --> 39:42.650]  You are closer to Christina Aguilera than you've ever been.
[39:43.550 --> 39:44.610]  That's true. Yeah.
[39:44.650 --> 39:45.750]  Don't don't blow this.
[39:45.750 --> 39:47.970]  Not well, I don't I don't think I can.
[39:48.190 --> 39:50.410]  There's no there's nowhere to go from this.
[39:50.930 --> 39:54.070]  I don't even have the top times in Garfield Kart anymore.
[39:54.230 --> 39:55.550]  I'm not getting any top time.
[39:55.670 --> 39:57.810]  And right, right. But we have to move on from Garfield Kart.
[39:57.910 --> 40:01.010]  We got to get Mario Kart top times to hang out with Christina Aguilera,
[40:01.150 --> 40:02.230]  your cousin's friend or whatever.
[40:02.450 --> 40:03.470]  You need to start training.
[40:03.550 --> 40:04.390]  Yeah, stop letting the skip.
[40:04.410 --> 40:08.090]  I don't. Is she into is she into nugget challenges?
[40:08.270 --> 40:09.130]  Maybe. Is there?
[40:09.470 --> 40:11.530]  I don't know.
[40:11.710 --> 40:15.390]  Do you think she does like she like speed runs like she wants like AGDQ
[40:15.390 --> 40:16.450]  or whatever? Yeah.
[40:16.670 --> 40:19.850]  She's into like maybe she does like Rainbow Road Skip stuff.
[40:19.950 --> 40:21.250]  And she's like really doing that.
[40:21.330 --> 40:22.730]  Possible. It's possible.
[40:23.030 --> 40:24.850]  She's big on the link to the past randomizer.
[40:26.210 --> 40:27.490]  Oh, she loves those.
[40:28.350 --> 40:30.330]  She's all about save the animals. That was her number two.
[40:30.650 --> 40:31.170]  Yeah.
[40:32.890 --> 40:36.070]  Her number two favorite thing to do is watch randomized videos.
[40:36.610 --> 40:37.190]  Big into it.
[40:37.490 --> 40:42.250]  Christina Aguilera watching randomizer speedrun videos.
[40:43.210 --> 40:44.690]  It's so funny.
[40:46.270 --> 40:49.270]  I wonder if you guys will have like a friendly rivalry
[40:49.270 --> 40:51.410]  or if it'll be acrimonious from the start.
[40:51.870 --> 40:54.090]  Oh, I think it would be a friendly rivalry.
[40:54.330 --> 40:55.030]  Well, maybe.
[40:55.970 --> 41:00.630]  I don't really have like genuine mean like hatred rivalries.
[41:00.890 --> 41:01.650]  What do you mean?
[41:02.990 --> 41:03.790]  She might.
[41:05.190 --> 41:08.290]  That's yeah, but I guess you need to to go that way.
[41:08.450 --> 41:08.970]  I don't think you do.
[41:09.510 --> 41:11.590]  There's a lot of people that hate me who I don't hate back.
[41:12.270 --> 41:14.250]  I have I have a no.
[41:14.470 --> 41:18.270]  I bear no ill will towards a ton of people who hate the fuck out of me.
[41:18.570 --> 41:19.330]  But what am I going to do?
[41:19.330 --> 41:21.530]  Would you describe that as a rivalry?
[41:21.770 --> 41:23.770]  I think it needs to go both ways on there.
[41:23.870 --> 41:24.650]  And I think it is.
[41:25.690 --> 41:26.690]  I think that's just hatred.
[41:26.850 --> 41:27.830]  I don't think that's a rivalry.
[41:29.150 --> 41:33.870]  I think there needs to be a mutual thing for it to be an actual rivalry.
[41:34.250 --> 41:38.490]  Although the exception that Eric would know better about this than I would.
[41:38.490 --> 41:41.030]  Doesn't these are wrestling people?
[41:41.390 --> 41:44.090]  Doesn't like Jim Cornette hate Vince Russo?
[41:44.230 --> 41:46.410]  And Vince Russo isn't different to Jim Cornette.
[41:46.650 --> 41:51.950]  But Jim Cornette can't stay like he just actively wants Vince Russo to die.
[41:52.210 --> 41:53.050]  Yeah. Over wrestling.
[41:53.230 --> 41:55.730]  Yeah, it's like that's I guess I'd call that a rivalry.
[41:55.750 --> 41:58.370]  And that is it seemingly very one sided rivalry.
[41:58.570 --> 42:02.270]  I think the way to look at it is that it means so much to one guy.
[42:02.490 --> 42:06.670]  And it doesn't like the thing that he feels like the other guy ruined.
[42:06.770 --> 42:07.770]  It means so much to him.
[42:07.770 --> 42:11.970]  And the guy that quote unquote ruined it doesn't give a fuck about it
[42:11.970 --> 42:15.450]  so much that he doesn't care that this other guy wishes him dead.
[42:16.030 --> 42:20.030]  There's a great compilation of I think it was Dark Side of the Ring
[42:20.030 --> 42:22.870]  like covered them in some way, which is like a vice wrestling thing
[42:22.870 --> 42:27.290]  where it's Jim Cornette yelling at Vince Russo being like,
[42:27.470 --> 42:31.050]  I am going to kill that motherfucker and piss on his grave.
[42:31.330 --> 42:32.610]  I will choke him out.
[42:32.830 --> 42:34.750]  I will make his children watch.
[42:34.970 --> 42:37.150]  He is a no good line, son of a bitch.
[42:37.150 --> 42:43.370]  And then cut to Vince Russo just being like, it's wrestling from 20 years ago.
[42:43.630 --> 42:45.190]  Jesus Christ.
[42:45.430 --> 42:46.950]  When are we going to move on?
[42:47.130 --> 42:54.770]  It would really be like, Geoff, like if you just were so mad at Gavin
[42:54.770 --> 42:58.990]  for something that happened in Worms in 2008
[43:00.110 --> 43:03.050]  Gavin was like, it's fucking Worms.
[43:03.070 --> 43:06.990]  I mean, I mean, I've had that conversation with a few people.
[43:07.150 --> 43:10.390]  I was about to say, I think you've just described my relationship with Ray.
[43:10.590 --> 43:12.450]  I think he's still mad at me about shit.
[43:14.170 --> 43:16.930]  He's still he's still mad at me that I threw some fucking blocks
[43:16.930 --> 43:19.170]  in front of him in a Mario game in 2012.
[43:20.370 --> 43:24.890]  I think the biggest version of that's probably how the Philadelphia 76ers
[43:24.890 --> 43:29.010]  have a rivalry with the Boston Celtics, who don't care because we beat them
[43:29.930 --> 43:32.770]  with our sixth through 10th starter or sixth through 10th man.
[43:33.210 --> 43:35.590]  And Joel Embiid goes to bed every night punching a pillow,
[43:35.590 --> 43:39.330]  seeing a picture of Jason Tatum and Jason Tatum doesn't think about Joel Embiid at all.
[43:41.130 --> 43:41.770]  Confetti game.
[43:42.250 --> 43:44.110]  I love Ray and I really miss playing games with him.
[43:44.350 --> 43:48.090]  I blew him up once with C4 in a game of Rainbow Six
[43:48.090 --> 43:50.230]  and I thought he was going to murder me in real life.
[43:52.510 --> 43:56.850]  Just because I kept opening doors with C4 instead of the handle and he was
[43:58.350 --> 44:00.350]  really not happy about it after a while.
[44:00.630 --> 44:02.930]  I remember that day, dude.
[44:03.430 --> 44:04.970]  I forgot you did that.
[44:05.070 --> 44:06.670]  Oh, I feel bad about that.
[44:07.310 --> 44:11.550]  See, now imagine there's a documentary where they ask Ray about it and he goes,
[44:11.770 --> 44:13.870]  I'll kill you, I'll fucking kill you, I'll kill you.
[44:13.930 --> 44:16.350]  And then it hard cuts to you and you go, oh, yeah, that was funny.
[44:17.170 --> 44:17.950]  That's all it is.
[44:19.070 --> 44:22.890]  What was the last trait that you noticed in a random stranger
[44:22.890 --> 44:27.530]  that you thought, I'll never be that guy, like I'll never have that trait?
[44:27.770 --> 44:28.730]  I should give an example.
[44:29.030 --> 44:31.490]  What are you talking about? Please give an example.
[44:31.490 --> 44:36.050]  I just, I was with a guy in public.
[44:36.410 --> 44:39.590]  Guy's phone rang and he just answered it.
[44:39.630 --> 44:42.070]  And he just said, he just answered, he went, talk to me.
[44:42.330 --> 44:44.590]  And I just figured I'm never going to be a talk to me guy.
[44:44.710 --> 44:46.930]  I'm never going to answer the phone and say, talk to me.
[44:46.970 --> 44:47.910]  I could never pull that off.
[44:48.310 --> 44:50.670]  And I feel like I'm noticing that about people a lot more where.
[44:51.510 --> 44:53.950]  I just differ from them at my core level.
[44:54.810 --> 44:55.510]  Would it help?
[44:55.950 --> 44:57.970]  Would you like to be a talk to me guy?
[44:58.050 --> 44:59.250]  Like, would you feel good if you did?
[44:59.410 --> 45:00.150]  No, I don't think I would.
[45:00.550 --> 45:02.290]  There's something about it I don't like about it.
[45:02.310 --> 45:04.250]  So you're happy not to be that guy?
[45:05.050 --> 45:08.150]  Yeah, I mean, nothing against that guy or talk to me guys.
[45:08.330 --> 45:12.630]  I just don't think that's a cool thing to say when you answer the phone.
[45:13.490 --> 45:14.510]  Oh, you don't think?
[45:14.690 --> 45:15.850]  No, I just don't think it's very cool.
[45:16.210 --> 45:16.830]  And I wouldn't ever try.
[45:17.170 --> 45:18.110]  You've never tried it.
[45:18.630 --> 45:19.890]  But how about this?
[45:20.050 --> 45:22.790]  After we record, what if I call you and you just throw it out there?
[45:22.850 --> 45:23.530]  You just say, talk to me.
[45:23.750 --> 45:26.090]  And then, yeah, I'll be willing to try it privately.
[45:26.090 --> 45:27.790]  But yeah, any comment leavers?
[45:28.110 --> 45:32.330]  If you're a talk to me people, let me know if you think it's cool.
[45:32.390 --> 45:33.330]  And I'm and I'm wrong.
[45:33.630 --> 45:39.670]  There was I was there was I heard the story about this guy that was in Vegas
[45:40.490 --> 45:42.870]  and his last name was free.
[45:43.150 --> 45:45.990]  And the waitress was like, that's a funny name.
[45:46.330 --> 45:51.510]  And she said, have you ever gotten anything free because of that?
[45:51.630 --> 45:55.770]  And then they said, maybe this drink and then they didn't get it for free.
[45:56.090 --> 45:58.550]  A place that is famous for giving free drinks.
[45:58.850 --> 45:59.970]  So I there's.
[46:01.270 --> 46:04.210]  I'd say that's the only like character thing I've had recently.
[46:04.330 --> 46:05.770]  I don't know if you've heard that story, but.
[46:06.090 --> 46:07.890]  Look, I know I'm not cool.
[46:08.950 --> 46:09.970]  I'm already aware.
[46:10.350 --> 46:11.990]  That's what I thought this was.
[46:12.030 --> 46:15.110]  I thought that you like the opposite of Icarus.
[46:15.390 --> 46:18.990]  Yeah, very far from the son of cool and heard this guy.
[46:19.070 --> 46:20.990]  And we're like, maybe I could be that.
[46:21.170 --> 46:22.350]  Maybe I could be that guy.
[46:22.650 --> 46:24.730]  That guy's cool. Talk to me, guy.
[46:26.390 --> 46:27.450]  Yeah, he started.
[46:27.610 --> 46:30.570]  He presented it as like, do you ever see somebody out in the wild and you think like,
[46:30.670 --> 46:32.130]  oh, that's a trade I'll never have.
[46:32.330 --> 46:35.270]  But what he meant to say is, don't you hate some people?
[46:36.630 --> 46:37.850]  But I didn't hate him.
[46:37.990 --> 46:41.250]  I just thought he's like a business guy in a tie.
[46:41.590 --> 46:45.630]  He he would probably have someone, you know, wanting to know about an upcoming trade.
[46:45.750 --> 46:49.230]  And I think in that environment, talk to me is absolutely the thing to say.
[46:49.530 --> 46:50.430]  It is fair.
[46:50.470 --> 46:53.630]  I feel like talk to me should be reserved for like Jack Bauer.
[46:53.630 --> 46:59.230]  That's somebody who is trying to stop a terrorist attack and needs immediate information.
[46:59.430 --> 46:59.990]  That's a good point.
[47:00.070 --> 47:02.290]  You know, I think talk to me always comes from a call.
[47:02.370 --> 47:03.510]  You're expecting, doesn't it?
[47:03.610 --> 47:08.150]  Yeah. If if your uncle, you haven't spoken to in three years, just randomly rang
[47:08.150 --> 47:11.490]  and you would never be like, talk to me, it would never happen.
[47:12.250 --> 47:15.590]  Do you do you answer the phone differently for different things?
[47:17.510 --> 47:18.390]  No. Yes.
[47:19.090 --> 47:20.090]  And what are some different?
[47:20.590 --> 47:22.010]  And now you expand on that.
[47:22.810 --> 47:24.790]  Um, well, usually I answer hello.
[47:25.610 --> 47:29.930]  And if it's my Italian granddad, I I make fun of him by saying hello.
[47:32.550 --> 47:34.270]  What didn't really come across.
[47:34.490 --> 47:36.070]  What do you what do you say?
[47:36.530 --> 47:38.610]  Hello. Hello.
[47:39.150 --> 47:40.370]  OK, I see.
[47:40.730 --> 47:42.410]  I just that is doing his voice.
[47:42.910 --> 47:44.090]  Yeah, that's like a cute thing.
[47:44.170 --> 47:46.310]  Do you do the thing where you pretend that you're surprised
[47:46.310 --> 47:48.510]  by the person who called you, even though there's caller ID?
[47:49.010 --> 47:51.670]  No, no. I do that all the time.
[47:52.010 --> 47:56.090]  I'm never just like I'm never just like giving them like a nice treat.
[47:56.930 --> 48:00.970]  I don't know what expects you to have looked at the phone.
[48:01.590 --> 48:02.530]  Yeah, I don't know.
[48:02.690 --> 48:06.950]  Like if somebody calls me and I look at it and I'll answer it, I'll be like, hello.
[48:07.410 --> 48:10.490]  And then they'll be like, hey, I'll be like, oh, it's you.
[48:11.150 --> 48:11.950]  Every time.
[48:12.410 --> 48:13.230]  That's just what I do.
[48:14.290 --> 48:15.710]  I've never considered it.
[48:15.870 --> 48:16.950]  Why? Yeah. Why?
[48:17.450 --> 48:20.850]  Well, do you just say, hey, Geoff, like, do you just what would you say?
[48:20.850 --> 48:22.770]  You two. OK, do I say, hey, Geoff?
[48:23.010 --> 48:24.550]  No, you two act out a call right now.
[48:24.610 --> 48:25.610]  Geoff, you're calling Gavin.
[48:28.090 --> 48:29.490]  Bring. All right, bring.
[48:30.810 --> 48:31.690]  Bring. All right.
[48:31.750 --> 48:32.530]  You haven't picked up yet.
[48:32.690 --> 48:33.890]  Oh, it's still ringing.
[48:34.930 --> 48:36.290]  Hello. Hey, what's up?
[48:36.310 --> 48:37.330]  It's Geoff. Hey.
[48:37.710 --> 48:39.110]  Hey, I'm coming over to swim in your pool.
[48:39.170 --> 48:39.710]  You don't have to be there.
[48:40.290 --> 48:41.810]  That's what I do. Kind of.
[48:43.490 --> 48:46.230]  That's not what that's not what you described.
[48:46.430 --> 48:47.470]  Let me answer it like Andrew.
[48:47.870 --> 48:48.910]  OK, OK.
[48:48.910 --> 48:51.190]  Bling bling.
[48:51.690 --> 48:54.070]  Hello. Hey, what's up?
[48:54.270 --> 48:56.090]  Who is this? OK, it's Geoff.
[48:57.670 --> 48:58.950]  What do you mean?
[49:01.230 --> 49:02.670]  OK, this is my point.
[49:03.010 --> 49:04.810]  Geoff clarified who he was.
[49:05.130 --> 49:07.070]  Oh, he knows there's a call thing.
[49:07.550 --> 49:10.070]  Yeah, that's what that's what I guess what I actually meant.
[49:10.310 --> 49:13.670]  There's always a clarification of who's calling when I don't feel like it's needed.
[49:14.550 --> 49:16.750]  Hmm. Well, that's not how I answer the phone.
[49:17.490 --> 49:21.850]  If I were to get a call from any of you here, let's do it or anybody rather.
[49:22.070 --> 49:25.070]  I answer the phone the same way for everybody here.
[49:25.850 --> 49:26.850]  Gavin, you're calling Geoff.
[49:27.010 --> 49:28.590]  Yeah, call me. Ring ring.
[49:29.590 --> 49:30.690]  All right, I'm picking up.
[49:31.090 --> 49:31.770]  What's wrong?
[49:33.370 --> 49:34.570]  Hey, hey, it's Gavin.
[49:34.910 --> 49:36.390]  What's wrong? Is everything OK?
[49:36.670 --> 49:38.750]  Are you you're not in the pool right now?
[49:38.770 --> 49:39.490]  That's what's wrong.
[49:40.490 --> 49:43.690]  OK, that's fine, because usually when somebody calls or something wrong
[49:43.690 --> 49:44.990]  and it's going to cost me money or time.
[49:44.990 --> 49:47.410]  OK, so that's that's kind of what I was driving at.
[49:47.530 --> 49:50.590]  Geoff, like maybe maybe you're the person I should be talking to.
[49:51.050 --> 49:53.170]  When when you have.
[49:54.630 --> 49:57.630]  Workers who have to come to your house or someone that you
[49:58.270 --> 50:01.810]  have to, like, talk to over the phone, they're going to be doing work or whatever.
[50:01.970 --> 50:03.710]  Do you just say hello when you answer?
[50:04.510 --> 50:07.070]  I will say I'll say hello.
[50:07.190 --> 50:07.850]  This is Geoff speaking.
[50:08.150 --> 50:10.470]  OK, that's OK. That's what I was getting.
[50:10.590 --> 50:13.090]  I answer the phone when I know that it's someone like that.
[50:13.090 --> 50:14.350]  I just say, this is Eric.
[50:15.770 --> 50:18.410]  Yeah, that's what I was getting at.
[50:18.550 --> 50:21.290]  But I feel like maybe asking Andrew and Kev.
[50:22.470 --> 50:24.950]  When I run into those situations.
[50:25.730 --> 50:30.610]  OK, call me as though you're a family member calling me without texting me first.
[50:34.410 --> 50:35.530]  Bling bling.
[50:36.090 --> 50:36.570]  Who's dead?
[50:38.370 --> 50:39.730]  Look at your caller ID.
[50:39.850 --> 50:40.850]  Dumbass, it's your cousin.
[50:42.050 --> 50:42.390]  Wilbur.
[50:42.390 --> 50:44.710]  Wait, why would they be dead if they're on my caller ID?
[50:45.550 --> 50:47.070]  I said it's your cousin, dumbass.
[50:47.170 --> 50:48.670]  It's Wilbur Free, your cousin.
[50:48.990 --> 50:50.970]  You know me. I'm in your phone under Wilbur.
[50:51.430 --> 50:52.190]  Cool. Best cousin.
[50:54.650 --> 50:57.390]  Well, that's the worst phone call I've ever had in my life.
[50:57.490 --> 50:58.710]  I'm never calling you back.
[50:58.950 --> 50:59.670]  You didn't tell me who was dead.
[50:59.670 --> 51:00.550]  My least favorite cousin.
[51:00.910 --> 51:02.310]  I didn't say anybody was. What?
[51:02.430 --> 51:04.090]  Nobody's dead. It's your cousin Wilbur.
[51:05.350 --> 51:06.630]  Oh, I'm sorry. Let's do it again.
[51:06.830 --> 51:07.410]  Let's do it again.
[51:07.850 --> 51:09.510]  OK. Bling bling.
[51:09.770 --> 51:10.430]  Who's dead?
[51:10.970 --> 51:12.730]  Everybody in your family.
[51:14.110 --> 51:16.230]  You and I are the last ones left.
[51:16.990 --> 51:18.230]  It's a massacre.
[51:18.550 --> 51:19.310]  It's gruesome.
[51:19.670 --> 51:20.510]  It was terrible.
[51:20.870 --> 51:23.210]  All coincidence. Nothing connected.
[51:23.650 --> 51:26.010]  Everybody dropped dead within 24 hours.
[51:26.350 --> 51:27.750]  Complete happenstance.
[51:28.110 --> 51:29.390]  It's chaos here.
[51:29.890 --> 51:31.050]  We don't know what to do.
[51:31.390 --> 51:32.730]  Get on a plane immediately.
[51:32.990 --> 51:35.370]  But maybe don't because you might die too.
[51:35.690 --> 51:37.070]  Anyway, hope you're doing well.
[51:37.270 --> 51:39.310]  Love you. Thinking about coming to America this summer.
[51:39.350 --> 51:39.850]  I'll look you up.
[51:39.850 --> 51:40.670]  OK, bye.
[51:41.690 --> 51:43.570]  That's how you hang up with that news.
[51:45.030 --> 51:46.630]  Did you consider the possibility
[51:46.630 --> 51:49.090]  that they were talking to somebody with the name Talk To Me?
[51:49.630 --> 51:51.250]  Because that really changes the tone.
[51:51.510 --> 51:53.250]  That could be their name.
[51:53.470 --> 51:54.550]  They could just be like, talk to me.
[51:54.870 --> 51:57.170]  Or the company he works for is called Talk To Me.
[51:57.630 --> 51:59.050]  That's also another possibility.
[51:59.710 --> 52:04.690]  Oh, you know, isn't there a movie called Talk To Me that just came out as well?
[52:05.330 --> 52:06.490]  Maybe they're talking about the movie.
[52:07.530 --> 52:08.950]  Maybe they picked up.
[52:09.010 --> 52:12.170]  And the first thing was, what's the name of that movie that just came out?
[52:12.210 --> 52:13.270]  And they said, talk to me.
[52:13.310 --> 52:15.170]  I once worked for a production company called Love.
[52:15.630 --> 52:16.770]  And you'd call them.
[52:16.830 --> 52:17.750]  They'd be like, hello, love.
[52:19.050 --> 52:19.930]  That's pretty cool.
[52:20.050 --> 52:22.170]  Yeah, I love love.
[52:22.690 --> 52:25.930]  Speaking of names, I had this idea when I was playing video games last night.
[52:25.930 --> 52:29.810]  I was thinking, wouldn't it be funny to change your gamer tag
[52:29.810 --> 52:32.710]  to something really clever?
[52:32.730 --> 52:35.870]  Like if you change your gamer tag to like, hey, Alexa,
[52:35.870 --> 52:37.050]  order butt cream.
[52:37.610 --> 52:39.670]  And then when you kill somebody in Call of Duty and they're like,
[52:40.030 --> 52:42.390]  I just got killed by hey, Alexa, order butt cream.
[52:43.170 --> 52:45.430]  And then Alexa's like, ordering butt cream.
[52:46.850 --> 52:48.230]  Oh, my God. Shut up.
[52:48.450 --> 52:49.450]  What's the...
[52:49.450 --> 52:50.990]  Alexa's over there. She heard me.
[52:52.230 --> 52:53.750]  Did you just get yourself?
[52:54.070 --> 52:54.970]  I think I just got myself.
[52:55.110 --> 52:55.850]  I think I just got myself.
[52:56.030 --> 52:57.370]  I can't hear what she's saying, but she's talking.
[52:58.410 --> 53:00.070]  I think you might have a package at the door.
[53:01.290 --> 53:03.490]  I mean, that's a real poop face, honestly.
[53:03.950 --> 53:04.910]  What a situation.
[53:06.630 --> 53:10.710]  But I think people should start approaching their gamer tags
[53:10.710 --> 53:12.650]  and their online monitors like that.
[53:12.650 --> 53:16.670]  You threw a ball in the air to take a swing at?
[53:16.850 --> 53:18.370]  It's going to hit you in the face.
[53:18.750 --> 53:19.850]  Yeah. What the fuck?
[53:20.370 --> 53:21.110]  What just happened?
[53:21.570 --> 53:24.630]  But if I change my gamer tag to that, it might hit somebody else in the face, too.
[53:25.950 --> 53:27.170]  At least we know it works.
[53:28.030 --> 53:29.290]  It works against you.
[53:30.510 --> 53:33.270]  You've created your own worst enemy, I think, potentially.
[53:33.870 --> 53:36.770]  What do you think is the go-to brand of butt cream that she'd go for?
[53:37.110 --> 53:37.610]  I don't know.
[53:38.030 --> 53:39.730]  Yeah, I'm not in the...
[53:39.730 --> 53:41.670]  I'll tell you tomorrow when it shows up.
[53:41.790 --> 53:45.070]  Is normal butt cream for on the outside of the butt or inside?
[53:45.590 --> 53:47.510]  That's a great question. I don't I don't know.
[53:47.870 --> 53:50.550]  It probably depends on the problem, I'd assume.
[53:50.690 --> 53:52.350]  All right. Hold on. We'll Google butt cream.
[53:52.690 --> 53:56.890]  But I assume there's a large variety of issues that butt cream can solve,
[53:56.990 --> 53:58.030]  whether it be rashes.
[53:58.930 --> 54:01.970]  Because my mind immediately goes to like baby butt cream for the outside.
[54:01.970 --> 54:05.390]  But then I'm thinking of like hemorrhoid cream, which would I assume be for the inside.
[54:05.470 --> 54:08.650]  The the first result is I don't do.
[54:09.150 --> 54:10.470]  Oh, I'm nervous.
[54:11.710 --> 54:12.830]  Boudreaux's butt paste.
[54:13.030 --> 54:14.230]  I think it's for babies.
[54:14.370 --> 54:16.290]  A baby strong? Yeah.
[54:18.990 --> 54:23.710]  I feel like that's the origin story to Punch Out, like the guy from Punch Out.
[54:23.930 --> 54:26.630]  Oh, this is for this for Gavin.
[54:27.790 --> 54:28.930]  Oh, butt acne cream.
[54:29.090 --> 54:30.090]  That's where your butt sits.
[54:31.190 --> 54:32.470]  Made in the USA, baby.
[54:34.290 --> 54:38.850]  I mean, it's not ideal to have butt acne, but I can't imagine I'd ever care.
[54:38.970 --> 54:40.750]  You're not seeing your ass.
[54:41.350 --> 54:44.590]  There's a lot. Yeah, but you want a presentable ass for your bum cream.
[54:44.770 --> 54:45.770]  Friends and partners and that.
[54:47.370 --> 54:49.850]  Is that why you don't have back tattoos, Geoff?
[54:50.390 --> 54:53.410]  I have a few, but because I can't see them. Yeah.
[54:54.010 --> 54:57.830]  No, the main reason I don't have a lot of back tattoos is because I feel like it's
[54:57.830 --> 55:01.170]  it's the biggest piece of real estate on your body.
[55:01.410 --> 55:03.830]  And if I'm going to get something, I want to fill it up.
[55:03.930 --> 55:05.550]  And if I'm going to fill it up, it should be with something
[55:05.550 --> 55:07.330]  that I'm going to be able to put up with for the rest of my life.
[55:07.650 --> 55:10.490]  I just haven't found something that I care that much about yet.
[55:10.810 --> 55:14.610]  What about, hey, Alexa, order butt cream just left to right.
[55:14.830 --> 55:16.890]  You you don't have an Alexa, do you?
[55:16.890 --> 55:19.050]  If you did right now, you'd have fucking... I don't.
[55:19.210 --> 55:20.470]  You'd have egg on my face.
[55:20.570 --> 55:22.210]  If I did, I would have stepped right in that trap.
[55:22.210 --> 55:25.250]  Bellamy Lux butt acne cream would be on its way to you right now
[55:25.250 --> 55:27.310]  so you can exfoliate, heal and renew.
[55:27.910 --> 55:29.930]  There's a world in which we do a butt off.
[55:33.310 --> 55:36.370]  Maybe we all use a different brand of butt cream
[55:36.370 --> 55:40.550]  and then we can pair results and see who to determine the best butt cream.
[55:40.930 --> 55:43.810]  We can just see if it makes us funnier, maybe.
[55:44.270 --> 55:46.490]  And just that. Yeah. Just in case.
[55:47.250 --> 55:50.490]  Oh, like maybe instead of butt cream, we should just put icy hot on our butts.
[55:52.630 --> 55:54.010]  No, we've got no.
[55:54.350 --> 55:55.310]  No, I feel like we've been there.
[55:55.310 --> 55:57.990]  No, I remember when it dripped into my ass crack.
[55:59.650 --> 56:00.910]  Yeah, I don't want to do that again.
[56:01.370 --> 56:02.110]  That's a bad idea, Eric.
[56:02.390 --> 56:04.950]  And Nick, my Discord says new audio device detected.
[56:05.530 --> 56:08.190]  Should I switch or should I don't switch?
[56:08.290 --> 56:09.790]  Don't switch. Why would you switch? Don't.
[56:09.850 --> 56:11.950]  I don't know. I'm just asking. I'm just clicking. Don't switch.
[56:12.030 --> 56:13.330]  I don't know why I have a new audio device.
[56:13.690 --> 56:15.830]  Should I switch or should I don't switch?
[56:16.090 --> 56:16.970]  Should I don't switch?
[56:17.810 --> 56:18.710]  One, two, don't switch.
[56:19.190 --> 56:20.810]  Everyone loves one, two, don't switch.
[56:22.330 --> 56:23.130]  It's a great game.
[56:23.130 --> 56:27.870]  Hey, I got a I got a I need a gut check something with you guys real fast.
[56:28.890 --> 56:32.570]  I've been watching a lot of Sloppy Joe's again.
[56:32.690 --> 56:34.810]  Like I had to take a little break after going there, you know,
[56:34.830 --> 56:36.790]  just like get a chill out for a bit, but I'm back into it.
[56:36.850 --> 56:38.770]  It's been phenomenal since I got back into it.
[56:39.090 --> 56:42.790]  I have come up with like seven or eight new prompts that I think are fantastic.
[56:43.050 --> 56:47.150]  And I I was going to have GherkyT update the thing.
[56:47.250 --> 56:49.650]  I already reached out to him about that. Something else.
[56:51.730 --> 56:55.250]  But then I got to thinking we're releasing those bingo cards in a couple of months.
[56:55.550 --> 56:59.150]  Maybe we shouldn't change the list before we release the bingo cards.
[56:59.270 --> 57:00.430]  Can we not update the bingo cards?
[57:01.050 --> 57:02.510]  I think they're already off to the printer.
[57:02.670 --> 57:04.390]  I think we could just make a V2, can we?
[57:04.870 --> 57:08.170]  Like, yeah, I'm just saying, like, maybe after we release them, then I update the.
[57:08.250 --> 57:10.130]  I don't know. What did you call the guy?
[57:11.490 --> 57:12.250]  GherkyT. GherkyT.
[57:12.450 --> 57:14.190]  It's GovCon.
[57:14.670 --> 57:16.670]  GovCon? His name is Goobicon.
[57:16.930 --> 57:17.230]  Yeah, Goobicon.
[57:17.870 --> 57:20.650]  But I called him the wrong thing, like in six episodes ago.
[57:20.750 --> 57:22.330]  And so I just decided I'm going to keep doing it.
[57:22.330 --> 57:25.890]  OK, I think I've called him GherkyT and GherkyV.
[57:26.430 --> 57:31.310]  Yeah, he's the one who has the and the one and only Andrew Balaclava right now.
[57:31.590 --> 57:37.010]  Yes. I feel like the hype surrounding the Andrew Balaclava is through the roof.
[57:37.090 --> 57:40.390]  I've seen a lot of comment leavers saying they cannot wait to get
[57:41.030 --> 57:42.390]  to get their heads up one.
[57:42.890 --> 57:46.630]  Can I make a request of of all the comment leavers and regulation listeners
[57:47.470 --> 57:50.270]  who comprise the potential list of
[57:51.650 --> 57:52.610]  Balaclava purchasers?
[57:53.030 --> 57:55.450]  Please don't commit crimes in the Balaclava.
[57:56.270 --> 57:58.430]  Yeah, I agree. Please don't.
[57:58.450 --> 58:02.330]  Do not like don't take this as an opportunity to start a life of crime
[58:02.330 --> 58:05.270]  or to knock over a bank or a gas station or any of that.
[58:05.410 --> 58:06.670]  Like, don't do that.
[58:06.750 --> 58:09.230]  That's the you don't use it for nefarious means.
[58:09.510 --> 58:09.630]  Please.
[58:09.630 --> 58:13.450]  Yeah, the whole reason behind the Balaclava was that so I could wear a Balaclava,
[58:13.670 --> 58:15.330]  but not intimidate people.
[58:15.330 --> 58:17.890]  Right. Exactly. Exactly.
[58:18.310 --> 58:21.810]  Exactly. Let's not taint the spirit of the Balaclava
[58:21.810 --> 58:23.470]  by making Andrew's face public.
[58:23.530 --> 58:24.210]  Yeah, number one.
[58:24.570 --> 58:26.490]  It's literally a Balaclava for being nice.
[58:26.830 --> 58:27.530]  Yeah, there you go.
[58:27.710 --> 58:29.570]  That's it. Eric wrote that, too.
[58:29.830 --> 58:30.810]  It's for being nice only.
[58:30.870 --> 58:33.530]  It's a nice Balaclava for nice people who do nice things.
[58:33.690 --> 58:35.390]  It's the monstrosity is what it is.
[58:35.470 --> 58:36.770]  I mean, just being honest.
[58:37.230 --> 58:39.030]  What a nightmare that thing is.
[58:40.070 --> 58:43.290]  I mean, you were wondering what you would be like for future generations
[58:43.290 --> 58:46.310]  and they're going to Google you and it's going to be people wearing your face.
[58:46.630 --> 58:47.630]  That's true. Yeah.
[58:48.450 --> 58:49.250]  Oh, God.
[58:50.470 --> 58:53.910]  Can speaking of nightmares, can I share you guys
[58:53.910 --> 58:56.450]  the one thing in my life that's not going great right now?
[58:56.810 --> 58:58.250]  Of course. I'm sorry.
[58:58.350 --> 58:59.270]  You're everything else is awesome.
[58:59.590 --> 59:00.790]  I'm vibrating with happiness.
[59:00.990 --> 59:02.190]  We're making a video content.
[59:02.290 --> 59:02.690]  I'm real jazz.
[59:02.910 --> 59:03.670]  Teeth or house.
[59:04.350 --> 59:06.250]  Yeah, it's going to be teeth or house. You're right.
[59:06.290 --> 59:06.910]  It's one of those two.
[59:06.990 --> 59:09.050]  You want to roll the dice and tell me which one you think it is.
[59:09.370 --> 59:11.230]  House. I think it's house.
[59:11.230 --> 59:15.030]  So so discovered recently
[59:15.030 --> 59:18.230]  beginning wasps in the house and figured out
[59:18.710 --> 59:21.790]  they keep ended up in Millie's room when in the other day
[59:22.450 --> 59:25.610]  looking at the window, realized that all of the windows
[59:25.610 --> 59:29.030]  on the south side of my house, which just gets blasted with sun.
[59:29.230 --> 59:32.370]  You know, my house is like 100 years old and it's very old.
[59:33.750 --> 59:37.070]  The sun is melting my windows
[59:37.070 --> 59:39.750]  and they're they're shrinking out of the frame
[59:39.750 --> 59:42.310]  so that there's about a half inch.
[59:42.610 --> 59:47.030]  There's like a half inch gap between the top of the window and the house.
[59:47.170 --> 59:51.170]  Now it's just like shrinking down like it's melted.
[59:51.410 --> 59:54.610]  The like silicon seal or it's melting the glass out of the window.
[59:54.750 --> 59:56.990]  Now the glass isn't melting, but like the silicon seal or something,
[59:57.030 --> 59:59.210]  it's just like you can see it pooling up at the bottom.
[59:59.450 --> 01:00:01.930]  And and it's just it's just falling slowly.
[01:00:03.070 --> 01:00:05.770]  You're two summers away from owning a tiny home.
[01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:08.610]  Dude, it's just everything is going to shrink.
[01:00:10.210 --> 01:00:13.010]  Every time. Get out before it gets too small.
[01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:18.490]  Every time I have a house problem
[01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:22.850]  and then I have to spend a bunch of money, I then recover from the house problem.
[01:00:23.130 --> 01:00:26.210]  And right about the time my savings and everything recovers,
[01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:29.950]  I get hit with a new problem that costs almost identical
[01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:31.490]  to what the last problem cost.
[01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:35.390]  Do you know how much it's costing to get five windows put into my house?
[01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:41.130]  Oh, that's a $13,000 problem right there, my friend.
[01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:43.950]  And oh, my God.
[01:00:44.890 --> 01:00:48.110]  You don't get them for three months.
[01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:50.990]  So right around the time that the heat stops,
[01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:53.250]  I'll finally be able to plug the holes in Millie's room.
[01:00:53.290 --> 01:00:57.230]  Although I have stuffed it with insulating foam and I caulked it.
[01:00:57.390 --> 01:00:59.010]  Like the guy gave me instructions on how to cover it up.
[01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:04.290]  So there's no longer pure fucking sun and heat and wasps blasting in.
[01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:05.890]  But God damn it, man.
[01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:08.950]  So is it like a fridge from where they're a nonstandard size
[01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:10.330]  or is that just how much windows are?
[01:01:10.650 --> 01:01:13.010]  It's a couple of things. I'm not buying vinyl windows.
[01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:15.970]  I'm buying from the same company that put the windows in the rest of my house,
[01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:18.150]  which I didn't. They were there before I got here.
[01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:22.390]  So they're like two paint and they have argon inside the glass.
[01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:26.310]  That's like it's rated for like 20 years.
[01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:30.190]  And it's just to help like severely or it's up to tremendously
[01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:32.970]  lower the temperature in the house.
[01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:38.890]  So, yeah, it's like it helps, I guess, insulate and the dual paint thing.
[01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:42.270]  And it like helps with the sound so that it'll actually it's actually
[01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:45.290]  going to help with a lot of problems we have with it being too hot
[01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:48.630]  on that side of the house, because you can't get all the way over there
[01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:51.290]  because I don't have a I don't have a I don't have an attic.
[01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:53.150]  What if you just put on shutters?
[01:01:53.770 --> 01:01:55.770]  Yeah, that might be cheaper than the windows,
[01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:58.530]  but I'd still have the holes in the wall to deal with.
[01:01:58.570 --> 01:02:01.130]  And they're still and it's still falling like it's getting worse.
[01:02:01.790 --> 01:02:06.590]  Um, anyway, so I got I got that to deal with, but I remain I remain positive.
[01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:09.230]  But the fridge is still good and fridges.
[01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:10.730]  They yeah, it's awesome.
[01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:14.370]  You don't need me to send you new windows in the meantime.
[01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:17.110]  Did the toilet is better than ever.
[01:02:17.290 --> 01:02:21.670]  I god damn dude, I have got I have got
[01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:26.870]  toilet time dialed in between the Toto and the sunglasses.
[01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:29.650]  I it's it's I've really got it down to a
[01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:31.590]  quite pleasurable science.
[01:02:31.890 --> 01:02:36.150]  Do you ask blast before a wipe or do you wipe first and then blast your ass?
[01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:40.990]  Excuse me, do I wipe before I shit?
[01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:42.950]  No, no, no.
[01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:45.030]  The bidet near the runway.
[01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:47.210]  Oh, no.
[01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:49.790]  You got to start wiping before you shit.
[01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:51.890]  It's like your ass.
[01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.850]  I'm just priming.
[01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:55.390]  No, no, I blast after I'm not.
[01:02:55.530 --> 01:02:56.570]  I'm not. Yeah, I'm not.
[01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:57.870]  You blast after what?
[01:02:57.870 --> 01:02:59.150]  After I shit.
[01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:00.290]  I'm still asking.
[01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:01.570]  What do you ask?
[01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:06.010]  I think what he's what he's asking, Geoff, is if you've encountered anyone
[01:03:06.010 --> 01:03:09.630]  recently in the toilet that has a very specific set of traits that you wish.
[01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:13.590]  Yeah, this the people that ask these questions.
[01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:18.490]  No, you asked if I if I blast my ass with the water before I poop.
[01:03:18.610 --> 01:03:19.090]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:21.570]  I forget it.
[01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:26.870]  It sounds like Gavin likes to get a river going to help with the process.
[01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:32.450]  Everything's I take poop medicine, so everything comes out real easily.
[01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:36.050]  I don't need I don't need the I don't need the additional lubricant.
[01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:38.630]  Gavin, if it helps you, I know exactly what you're asking.
[01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:39.630]  This is just way better.
[01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:41.670]  Well, why don't you ask? Did I ask it wrong?
[01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:42.850]  Well, did I say the wrong thing?
[01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:46.970]  Hey, do you wipe before you use your bidet or do you use your bidet before you wipe?
[01:03:47.530 --> 01:03:49.690]  Oh, I, I know.
[01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:50.830]  I don't wipe before I use my bidet.
[01:03:51.310 --> 01:03:55.770]  Hey, man, do you blast off before you shit and fuck or whatever?
[01:03:55.770 --> 01:03:57.190]  What's going on?
[01:03:57.430 --> 01:04:01.110]  Like, what an insane, what an insane way.
[01:04:01.850 --> 01:04:04.850]  I just thought that's how bidet people talk to each other.
[01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:06.130]  Talk about blasting their ass.
[01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:07.690]  I poop. Do they?
[01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:10.250]  And then I bidet and then I wipe.
[01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:13.490]  I'm pretty sure that's the preferred the preferred way to do it.
[01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:15.530]  Did you talk to me about ass blasting?
[01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:19.210]  I'm not trying to reinvent the shitting paradigm or anything in my bathroom.
[01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:20.710]  I'm just trying to have an enjoyable experience.
[01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:25.090]  When I've used a bidet, I've always gone for a courtesy wipe first,
[01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:28.910]  just so I don't get any dirty splashage.
[01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:30.950]  Oh, I don't.
[01:04:31.090 --> 01:04:34.290]  I've never had a problem with dirty splashage, splashage.
[01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:39.530]  I've never had that problem.
[01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:42.810]  Well, if you don't know, because you can't see it with the shades on.
[01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:45.650]  That is a possibility.
[01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:49.350]  All right. I'm going to take next time I shit, I'm going to I'm going to do it without
[01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:50.270]  without sunglasses.
[01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:53.090]  So your new podcast is called Dirty Splashage, right?
[01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:54.890]  Geoff's Dirty Splashage.
[01:04:56.810 --> 01:05:01.490]  Andrew, do you think Eric will be as excited for our podcasts as he is for Geoff's?
[01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:02.870]  No. Yes.
[01:05:03.930 --> 01:05:05.630]  I'm excited about your podcast. What is it?
[01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:06.270]  I can't wait.
[01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:08.910]  Mine's called Yeah, Innit?
[01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:17.090]  I thought yours was called Toad in the Hole.
[01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:21.850]  We're just getting so all right off the ground
[01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:24.370]  that people are going to start calling it Yeah, Innit?
[01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:32.090]  If I ever have you on as a guest, Gavin, that'll be the Yeah, Innit episodes.
[01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:33.810]  Oh, sweet. Yeah.
[01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:35.770]  Good to know. That was a fun ep.
[01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:37.070]  That was a loopy one towards the end.
[01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:38.370]  A little loopy.
[01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:40.510]  Should we should we knock it off and do it again?
[01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:41.090]  Yeah, we got to.
[01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:43.650]  Yeah. Are we going to give Andrew 10 minutes of downtime or whatever?
[01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:48.010]  No. Why don't you just try and research as much about potatoes as you can in 10 minutes?
[01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:51.290]  No. OK, if we just roll that in.
[01:05:56.070 --> 01:05:57.570]  All right. Not even one potato factor.
[01:05:58.510 --> 01:06:00.290]  Oh, you know what? Oh, sure. I'll get you a potato.
[01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:02.110]  How about this? How about this?
[01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:05.850]  Between now and the next episode, everybody and I'm including you,
[01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:09.130]  Eric and Nick as well, everybody look up one potato fact
[01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:11.170]  and then we'll all recite them at the beginning of the new episode
[01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:12.970]  and we'll see if we have different facts or the same fact.
[01:06:13.050 --> 01:06:15.270]  If any two people have the same fact, they both lose.
[01:06:16.350 --> 01:06:18.590]  Oh, OK. OK. No point. OK.
[01:06:18.830 --> 01:06:21.290]  This is how you tease a podcast.
[01:06:21.290 --> 01:06:26.750]  Tune in next time to hear us all battle with potato facts.
[01:06:27.330 --> 01:06:27.970]  Yeah, isn't it?
[01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:31.570]  Hey, it's going to be gold.
[01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:34.110]  Yukon gold. Bye bye.
[01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:39.970]  Hey, guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:41.930]  Are food shape like things better?
[01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:43.930]  Dino nuggets are the best nuggets.
[01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:45.550]  What is a potato smile?
[01:06:45.970 --> 01:06:47.530]  Geoff brings up Gus's obsessions.
[01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:50.150]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:52.990]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
