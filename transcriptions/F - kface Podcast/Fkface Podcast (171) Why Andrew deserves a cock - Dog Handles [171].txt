[00:10.420 --> 00:12.100]  This will be episode 171.
[00:12.240 --> 00:14.520]  In 170, we talked about eggs for Andrew.
[00:14.660 --> 00:15.420]  We talked about ketchup.
[00:15.660 --> 00:17.460]  We talked about sports, not sports names.
[00:17.960 --> 00:19.200]  Talked about Andrew's sleep struggles.
[00:19.380 --> 00:20.460]  We talked about chicken musings.
[00:21.200 --> 00:23.060]  We talked about Geoff's supplemental idea.
[00:23.180 --> 00:25.160]  We talked about Sinead O'Connor and Stevie Nicks.
[00:25.280 --> 00:28.320]  But we had a lot of talk about potato smileys.
[00:28.480 --> 00:29.680]  So that was all last time.
[00:29.740 --> 00:31.340]  That was 170. Now we're on 171.
[00:31.920 --> 00:33.640]  Sounds like a real Zazzler of a show.
[00:35.680 --> 00:36.480]  Definitely Zazzler.
[00:36.480 --> 00:40.560]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:40.940 --> 00:42.660]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:42.760 --> 00:45.480]  Last I checked with me, as always, we got Andrew Panton.
[00:45.780 --> 00:47.540]  We got Gavin Free. That's not it.
[00:47.740 --> 00:50.980]  We also have Nick and Eric and Gracie as well.
[00:51.240 --> 00:53.320]  They're they're out there in the ether somewhere listening in.
[00:53.360 --> 00:55.620]  This is episode 171.
[00:56.020 --> 00:59.060]  Andrew already promised it's going to be a Zazzler of an episode.
[00:59.500 --> 01:02.060]  Let me hit you with the first potato fact of the day.
[01:02.140 --> 01:05.500]  Did you know that in the 13th century in the Andes,
[01:05.500 --> 01:08.540]  the Incans used potatoes as currency?
[01:09.140 --> 01:10.600]  I didn't know that.
[01:10.980 --> 01:11.960]  Now you do. Wow.
[01:12.420 --> 01:13.720]  All right. Share your potato facts.
[01:14.140 --> 01:17.120]  So like if you if you robbed a bag of chips,
[01:17.120 --> 01:19.120]  that'd be like robbing a bank, essentially.
[01:19.240 --> 01:20.740]  That's like a duffel bag of money.
[01:21.220 --> 01:23.080]  100 percent. Interesting.
[01:23.480 --> 01:25.980]  I don't want to step on anybody else's potato facts
[01:25.980 --> 01:28.480]  because I'm sure you guys have them ready, ready to fire.
[01:29.360 --> 01:34.000]  But an interesting second potato fact that I read today is that nobody knows
[01:34.000 --> 01:35.900]  how potato chips were invented.
[01:36.060 --> 01:39.500]  Not really. There's a lot of rumors, but there's no actual concrete evidence.
[01:39.860 --> 01:40.940]  They just they just exist.
[01:41.420 --> 01:43.960]  I heard that the reason why the mine stopped the calendar
[01:43.960 --> 01:46.880]  is because somebody stole a bag of potato chips from the area.
[01:47.260 --> 01:48.180]  They all. You know what?
[01:48.620 --> 01:49.920]  Dude, you know.
[01:50.140 --> 01:52.300]  And that was the last anyone had ever seen it.
[01:52.480 --> 01:54.900]  Andrew, I've got some supporting evidence for that, actually,
[01:54.900 --> 01:55.840]  now that you mention it.
[01:55.980 --> 01:57.640]  Well, I wasn't talking about the mines.
[01:57.700 --> 01:58.560]  I was talking about the Incans.
[01:58.700 --> 02:00.860]  But they said at the time, potatoes held a lot of value
[02:00.860 --> 02:02.500]  because aside from being a great food source,
[02:02.500 --> 02:05.480]  they were also used for medical treatments and possibly
[02:06.020 --> 02:09.160]  to predict the weather and to measure time.
[02:09.820 --> 02:13.400]  Really? Like a like a clock or like long potato clock.
[02:13.500 --> 02:15.640]  Yeah, I guess. Huh?
[02:16.200 --> 02:19.980]  Yeah. Maybe they would measure like how long until they went bad or something.
[02:20.040 --> 02:22.440]  And then like when a potato went bad, they knew it was like it'd been a week
[02:22.440 --> 02:23.540]  or something. I don't know.
[02:23.720 --> 02:25.920]  Who knows those mysterious Incans?
[02:26.040 --> 02:28.480]  But yeah, I'll meet you when the potato is green.
[02:30.800 --> 02:32.640]  That's makes total sense.
[02:33.820 --> 02:35.340]  Well, hey, Gavin, welcome back.
[02:35.820 --> 02:36.440]  Oh, thanks.
[02:39.540 --> 02:41.340]  Are you here? Yeah, yeah.
[02:42.140 --> 02:43.720]  Are you sure? Oh, big time.
[02:43.920 --> 02:46.340]  I was all of you. Do you have anything to contribute?
[02:46.940 --> 02:48.480]  But here's what I was going to happen.
[02:48.520 --> 02:50.440]  I thought I was going to be asked for a potato fact.
[02:50.680 --> 02:54.260]  So I leant down to grab a tot because I'm munching on some tots here.
[02:54.700 --> 02:57.700]  And I was going to my fat was going to be this is what a tot sounds like.
[02:58.940 --> 03:00.020]  Is that what you said?
[03:00.880 --> 03:03.740]  Then you said something about being back.
[03:03.820 --> 03:05.500]  And I was like, I've got a tot in my mouth now.
[03:05.540 --> 03:08.180]  I mean, you could do that as your fact, I guess.
[03:08.340 --> 03:10.560]  I don't. Yeah. OK, here's my fact.
[03:10.780 --> 03:11.880]  This is what a tot sounds like.
[03:13.880 --> 03:15.140]  Great. Good job.
[03:15.320 --> 03:17.020]  Could not kill it. Fantastic.
[03:17.940 --> 03:20.400]  You never sound ever comes through for you, so.
[03:20.740 --> 03:22.340]  But I'm sure it's fine. I'm sure it's a discord issue.
[03:22.440 --> 03:26.000]  I'm sure it sounds great in audacity or whatever it is.
[03:26.340 --> 03:28.000]  Geoff, what did you think of the smile fries?
[03:28.380 --> 03:29.420]  Oh, I haven't had them yet.
[03:29.680 --> 03:32.480]  Oh, there was so much excitement around the smile fries.
[03:32.680 --> 03:34.340]  Can I be honest with you? Yeah, of course.
[03:34.460 --> 03:36.680]  I forgot about them the second after we stopped recording.
[03:36.780 --> 03:37.640]  They're in my freezer still.
[03:37.760 --> 03:38.540]  I'll try to cook them tonight.
[03:38.980 --> 03:41.000]  I got well, I got I got some I got some work I got to do tonight.
[03:41.080 --> 03:41.840]  I'll try to cook them tomorrow.
[03:42.340 --> 03:43.300]  I don't believe you.
[03:43.600 --> 03:44.780]  You don't believe that they're in the fridge?
[03:44.940 --> 03:46.880]  They're in my fridge. Yeah, I think smile fries is going to go a while.
[03:47.020 --> 03:49.820]  I think it'll be probably I'm going to say three weeks from now.
[03:50.140 --> 03:51.080]  You have some smile fries.
[03:51.980 --> 03:55.940]  That's as soon as we stop recording smile fries is going out of your brain.
[03:55.940 --> 03:57.540]  No, yeah, I'm not going to remember them.
[03:57.720 --> 03:58.540]  A hundred percent. Yeah.
[03:58.720 --> 04:00.660]  As soon as I take my headphones off, they don't exist.
[04:02.120 --> 04:02.960]  Nick wants me to drop.
[04:03.480 --> 04:04.580]  Mm. You know what?
[04:05.200 --> 04:07.280]  I'm tempted to, Nick, but I'm having some.
[04:08.280 --> 04:09.540]  I don't want to say it.
[04:10.980 --> 04:14.740]  No, no, I'm just having some I'm just having no oven issues right now.
[04:14.920 --> 04:16.160]  What's wrong with your oven?
[04:16.380 --> 04:17.880]  You're not. What do you mean?
[04:18.120 --> 04:21.760]  I turned I turned my oven on the other day and at the house, I smelled some gas.
[04:21.820 --> 04:22.680]  So I turned it back off.
[04:22.740 --> 04:23.900]  I haven't had a chance. Oh, no.
[04:24.040 --> 04:25.400]  I haven't had a chance to look into it yet.
[04:25.400 --> 04:27.480]  But so you just haven't used your oven?
[04:28.300 --> 04:30.760]  No, no, I've been using I can use my stovetop.
[04:30.840 --> 04:31.440]  No issues there.
[04:31.500 --> 04:36.000]  But when I turn the oven on, yeah, I noticed it was a gas leak.
[04:36.020 --> 04:37.200]  But only to the oven.
[04:37.540 --> 04:39.480]  Yeah. And only if I turn it on.
[04:39.540 --> 04:40.660]  Yeah. Plus, I got an air fryer.
[04:40.920 --> 04:43.620]  And listen, I got windows to fix.
[04:43.820 --> 04:44.780]  I got a wedding.
[04:44.980 --> 04:47.220]  I don't have time for I don't have time for oven problems.
[04:47.220 --> 04:49.540]  So I'm just not going to use my oven for a while.
[04:49.680 --> 04:50.940]  The oven doesn't exist.
[04:51.380 --> 04:52.840]  It exists. Just not.
[04:53.460 --> 04:55.440]  No, it essentially doesn't.
[04:55.640 --> 04:57.140]  Yeah. Andrew, how often do you use your oven?
[04:58.140 --> 04:59.080]  Oh, quite a bit.
[04:59.880 --> 05:01.120]  Throwing pizzas in there.
[05:03.060 --> 05:04.480]  Throwing pizzas in there.
[05:06.840 --> 05:09.860]  So what's ever stopped you from getting a little pizza oven in the old
[05:09.860 --> 05:10.860]  in the old bedroom there?
[05:11.160 --> 05:12.620]  Oh, it's too big.
[05:12.980 --> 05:15.200]  Oh, the pizza? No, a pizza oven isn't too big.
[05:15.520 --> 05:18.640]  I have a microwave, I think, would go ahead of a pizza oven.
[05:18.960 --> 05:20.500]  Are you sure? What do you microwave?
[05:21.080 --> 05:21.840]  Hot pockets.
[05:23.680 --> 05:25.560]  Hot pockets, I guess a popcorn.
[05:25.960 --> 05:28.020]  What do you eat more, popcorn or pizza?
[05:28.320 --> 05:30.280]  A pizza for sure. 100% pizza.
[05:30.500 --> 05:33.180]  Yeah, so I would pick up one of these puppies for $50.
[05:33.920 --> 05:37.160]  Wow. Oh, what's that?
[05:37.300 --> 05:42.720]  It's the Carnival King CPO 12 stainless steel countertop
[05:42.720 --> 05:46.180]  pizza snack of 120 volts, 1450 watts.
[05:46.220 --> 05:48.860]  You can pick it up for $59.99.
[05:50.500 --> 05:51.380]  That's a pretty good deal.
[05:52.560 --> 05:53.680]  1450 watts. Damn.
[05:54.380 --> 05:56.060]  And it specializes in pizza.
[05:57.760 --> 05:58.800]  Yeah, it's all it does.
[05:59.420 --> 06:00.500]  Well, I mean, look at the shape of it.
[06:00.560 --> 06:01.380]  What else are you cooking in there?
[06:01.540 --> 06:02.300]  I bet you could.
[06:02.400 --> 06:04.560]  I bet you could roll out a hot pocket and put it in there.
[06:04.940 --> 06:06.080]  Oh, for sure. Yeah.
[06:06.100 --> 06:07.560]  I mean, anything really fries.
[06:07.680 --> 06:09.260]  I could probably cook some smile fries in there.
[06:09.440 --> 06:10.820]  I assume. In there?
[06:11.380 --> 06:12.000]  Yeah, why not?
[06:12.420 --> 06:14.980]  You know how like, you know, sometimes when you when you pull something
[06:14.980 --> 06:17.200]  out of your pocket, like I got a new phone case for my phone
[06:17.200 --> 06:19.980]  because it's disintegrating and now it's like kind of rubber.
[06:19.980 --> 06:22.940]  So now when I pull it out of my pocket, my pocket comes out inside out.
[06:23.180 --> 06:25.840]  Do you think anybody's ever tried to cook a hot pocket inside out?
[06:26.500 --> 06:29.260]  Oh, well, like put a phone in it first and then pull the phone out.
[06:29.380 --> 06:30.260]  Yeah. And then pull the phone out.
[06:30.460 --> 06:32.280]  Like invert a hot pocket like a.
[06:33.000 --> 06:33.620]  I don't know.
[06:33.660 --> 06:34.880]  Like so many pants pockets.
[06:35.200 --> 06:38.080]  Has anyone ever needed a hot pocket?
[06:38.600 --> 06:39.120]  What do you mean?
[06:39.540 --> 06:43.300]  Like, oh, like all the time to keep food warm in your pocket.
[06:43.740 --> 06:46.520]  I swear to God, if you put my face in your pocket, we're done.
[06:46.760 --> 06:47.240]  The show's over.
[06:47.240 --> 06:47.980]  Why would I put your face in it?
[06:47.980 --> 06:51.140]  Because the last time this happened, you had a cold face
[06:51.140 --> 06:53.520]  and then the pant line happened.
[06:54.160 --> 06:57.540]  Oh, what was the reason that they went on sale?
[06:58.780 --> 06:59.420]  They did you watch?
[07:00.100 --> 07:01.100]  Can I talk about that?
[07:01.220 --> 07:04.020]  Can I can I take us on a little bit of a journey with this?
[07:04.200 --> 07:07.320]  Yeah, I have something to share and it's a little it's a little embarrassing,
[07:08.340 --> 07:13.380]  but I feel like that's the best place to share that type of info is this show.
[07:14.940 --> 07:16.660]  So I've been I've been doing rooster
[07:16.660 --> 07:22.880]  to stuff for a while, as you know, and one of one of my my favorite things
[07:22.880 --> 07:25.960]  the company does, I think this is a really great event.
[07:26.100 --> 07:28.980]  They do at the end of every year.
[07:29.500 --> 07:31.580]  They do a big like ceremony.
[07:31.700 --> 07:34.720]  Everyone gets together and they give out these big cock trophies to people
[07:34.720 --> 07:37.640]  that like have done exceptional work.
[07:38.180 --> 07:40.120]  And it's not like a competitive thing.
[07:40.180 --> 07:41.980]  It's like, oh, you've done really good this year.
[07:42.400 --> 07:45.300]  Here's an acknowledgment of your tough work.
[07:45.660 --> 07:46.820]  I just think that's nice.
[07:46.940 --> 07:47.940]  I've never won one.
[07:48.060 --> 07:49.200]  I assume. Have you guys won one?
[07:49.380 --> 07:51.960]  I wouldn't be shocked if most of the people here have won one of these
[07:51.960 --> 07:53.860]  cock trophies, cock trophy.
[07:54.140 --> 07:55.560]  Yeah, they give them out at the end of the year.
[07:55.940 --> 07:56.700]  I've never seen one.
[07:57.080 --> 08:00.740]  I've I've won a rooster teeth excellence award at the end of the year or whatever.
[08:00.800 --> 08:02.200]  I don't think it was called a cock trophy.
[08:03.200 --> 08:04.780]  Well, they have cock on them, don't they?
[08:04.980 --> 08:05.660]  Don't they say cock?
[08:05.760 --> 08:07.080]  I mean, they have a hold on.
[08:07.100 --> 08:08.300]  Let me look to my office.
[08:10.180 --> 08:11.980]  I'm pretty sure it's a cock trophy.
[08:12.580 --> 08:14.600]  It was it's the it's the cock bite award.
[08:15.340 --> 08:16.960]  I it's I haven't.
[08:17.060 --> 08:17.920]  Yeah, exactly.
[08:19.000 --> 08:19.720]  I haven't.
[08:19.720 --> 08:20.880]  I haven't won one.
[08:21.400 --> 08:22.640]  Blaine has and he broke it.
[08:22.760 --> 08:24.020]  So that that's why I know what it is.
[08:24.300 --> 08:28.660]  I won one in twenty eighteen and I don't think we call it a congratulations, dude.
[08:28.680 --> 08:29.280]  That's really cool.
[08:29.400 --> 08:29.920]  That's awesome.
[08:30.060 --> 08:31.560]  Very cool. Five years ago, I won one.
[08:31.700 --> 08:33.660]  I don't think they call it the cock bite trophy.
[08:34.080 --> 08:34.800]  They don't. No, not anymore.
[08:35.260 --> 08:36.220]  What about the OK?
[08:36.300 --> 08:38.280]  Well, we rebranded and we got rid of the teeth.
[08:38.640 --> 08:40.100]  I thought we were all cock now.
[08:40.520 --> 08:41.940]  Still called rooster teeth, though.
[08:42.060 --> 08:43.760]  This is not I don't like this.
[08:44.220 --> 08:45.580]  I thought it doesn't like this.
[08:45.900 --> 08:46.960]  It's just the rooster.
[08:47.320 --> 08:49.480]  This is the opposite of a zazzle conversation.
[08:49.720 --> 08:51.140]  Yeah, well, I don't like what.
[08:51.820 --> 08:53.560]  What what are you driving at?
[08:53.640 --> 08:54.980]  I suppose I'm getting here.
[08:55.040 --> 08:56.360]  OK, well, just give me a minute.
[08:56.440 --> 08:58.740]  I'm getting to I've always wanted every year.
[08:59.780 --> 09:01.680]  There's a part of me and this is the embarrassing part.
[09:01.800 --> 09:04.660]  There's every year I think maybe I'll win one of these cock trophies.
[09:04.860 --> 09:07.080]  That keeps people really excited about them.
[09:07.460 --> 09:08.260]  They're proud of it.
[09:08.680 --> 09:09.400]  They look great.
[09:09.500 --> 09:11.380]  And it's just the nice it's a nice little gesture.
[09:11.780 --> 09:12.740]  They rotate them out.
[09:12.740 --> 09:14.080]  I've never won one.
[09:14.160 --> 09:16.740]  I don't think I even technically can win one.
[09:17.100 --> 09:17.940]  What would you win one for?
[09:18.300 --> 09:19.860]  Just excellence in my field.
[09:20.200 --> 09:21.580]  I feel. Yeah.
[09:21.780 --> 09:24.960]  Just general good vibes, bringer of good vibes, maybe
[09:26.340 --> 09:28.040]  all sorts of options I could win.
[09:28.760 --> 09:32.220]  But anyway, I decided I want to make more of an initiative
[09:32.220 --> 09:35.280]  to try to win one of these things, because the year is almost over.
[09:35.400 --> 09:38.500]  We're getting close to like it's you got to pick up the slack.
[09:38.840 --> 09:39.900]  September's right around the corner.
[09:40.460 --> 09:44.140]  So I decided to attend an all hands meeting
[09:44.140 --> 09:47.520]  because I thought that put my hands in the mix showing I'm a real company guy.
[09:47.800 --> 09:49.680]  Group effort. I'm going to attend one.
[09:50.080 --> 09:53.760]  I looked I think I've been invited to around 85 all hands meetings.
[09:54.020 --> 09:55.920]  Wow. At my time being here.
[09:56.180 --> 10:01.200]  So if I attended this one, which I did, I would it would it would be my first.
[10:01.360 --> 10:02.540]  The first all hands.
[10:02.620 --> 10:04.420]  I've skipped every all hands for people that don't know.
[10:04.660 --> 10:07.400]  The all hands meeting is like a company wide meeting.
[10:07.580 --> 10:09.020]  You're so yeah, you're not supposed to skip it.
[10:09.020 --> 10:10.080]  You know, yeah, you're not.
[10:10.220 --> 10:11.560]  Well, no one's ever said that.
[10:12.740 --> 10:16.120]  Yeah. Well, I mean, the all hands kind of implies all hands on board.
[10:16.400 --> 10:18.380]  I'll put the I'll put this in your review. It's fine.
[10:19.220 --> 10:19.760]  That's great.
[10:19.920 --> 10:22.160]  Kind of. It's how we disseminate important information.
[10:22.640 --> 10:26.300]  Well, it's important to note in the review, Eric, is I attended one.
[10:26.600 --> 10:27.740]  I finally made one.
[10:28.400 --> 10:29.700]  Missed 85 of them prior.
[10:30.160 --> 10:34.000]  And I got to say, I don't feel like I was missing much necessarily from what I saw.
[10:34.060 --> 10:35.580]  But there's, you know, important updates to keep.
[10:35.640 --> 10:37.720]  They're talking about things. It's nice.
[10:38.360 --> 10:40.020]  We're going through different sections.
[10:40.740 --> 10:43.840]  We go through business stuff and then there's some other stuff.
[10:44.120 --> 10:45.780]  And then we get to the merch and the merch is a fun one.
[10:45.860 --> 10:47.700]  We love the people in merch. They're great.
[10:48.440 --> 10:50.780]  And the guy opens the merch thing.
[10:50.860 --> 10:51.940]  He's dressed as a pumpkin.
[10:52.120 --> 10:55.060]  It's really it's like the energy is really picking up in this stream.
[10:55.220 --> 10:55.640]  This is great.
[10:56.080 --> 10:58.660]  And he's going through the guy in the meeting was a pumpkin.
[10:58.960 --> 11:00.160]  It's it was Geoff Yetter.
[11:00.620 --> 11:02.320]  He dressed for every all hands.
[11:02.940 --> 11:04.920]  This would all make sense to you if you were there, Gavin.
[11:05.620 --> 11:07.200]  Yeah, well, I would know.
[11:07.200 --> 11:08.600]  I didn't know he dressed up for everyone.
[11:09.020 --> 11:10.560]  That's all. Yeah, that's 100%.
[11:10.560 --> 11:13.080]  So he's dressed up and he's going through his.
[11:13.220 --> 11:15.000]  Did anyone else go to the last all hands?
[11:15.280 --> 11:15.920]  Or am I the only one?
[11:16.320 --> 11:17.300]  I was there. Geoff was there.
[11:17.540 --> 11:20.620]  You were there. OK, well, then you might know where every I'm there.
[11:20.820 --> 11:23.420]  Every goddamn all hands, because I'm supposed to you.
[11:24.060 --> 11:26.080]  No wonder you won a trophy five years ago.
[11:26.100 --> 11:27.680]  Look at that exact record by you.
[11:28.400 --> 11:31.360]  So I'm watching this thing and that goes to the merch category.
[11:31.840 --> 11:34.160]  And they they say, oh, it's the Halloween.
[11:34.300 --> 11:35.780]  We're looking at everyone's Halloween merch.
[11:35.780 --> 11:37.120]  So they're going through different brands.
[11:37.320 --> 11:40.900]  They show and they got like some stuff.
[11:40.980 --> 11:42.200]  I guess I shouldn't spoil it.
[11:42.300 --> 11:43.420]  I think they're going to release it.
[11:43.460 --> 11:45.460]  No, you definitely please do not.
[11:45.600 --> 11:47.540]  But but there's different brands.
[11:47.760 --> 11:50.720]  There's you see ghosts and pumpkins and all that.
[11:50.800 --> 11:52.600]  All the Halloween stuff you would expect.
[11:52.880 --> 11:54.060]  And they're going through it.
[11:54.100 --> 11:54.920]  And I'm like, oh, that's nice.
[11:54.960 --> 11:56.360]  I like Halloween. This fantastic.
[11:56.860 --> 12:00.080]  And then he says, and last but not least,
[12:01.380 --> 12:02.780]  faces Halloween stuff.
[12:03.320 --> 12:04.920]  Gavin, are you have you seen
[12:04.920 --> 12:06.320]  our Halloween merch?
[12:07.160 --> 12:10.340]  No. Are you aware of the fact that we have Halloween merch?
[12:10.860 --> 12:12.480]  I wasn't. You weren't.
[12:12.560 --> 12:13.500]  Yeah, neither was I.
[12:13.640 --> 12:15.720]  So I'm watching this and I'm like, oh, what's this?
[12:16.040 --> 12:17.500]  I didn't know we're doing Halloween stuff.
[12:17.840 --> 12:20.980]  He says, and last but not least, faces Halloween merch.
[12:21.120 --> 12:22.700]  The Pantin Collection.
[12:23.120 --> 12:27.060]  They fucking put me in the Halloween category.
[12:27.620 --> 12:30.080]  That fuck that was so that's such an attack.
[12:30.160 --> 12:31.400]  I'm shocked by this.
[12:31.400 --> 12:34.360]  That's bullshit because it's just meant for everyday
[12:34.360 --> 12:36.980]  cold face use without being intimidating.
[12:37.380 --> 12:41.800]  So what happened there is he was making a joke.
[12:42.080 --> 12:44.340]  It's obviously not a part of the Halloween collection.
[12:44.780 --> 12:48.320]  He was just being silly because it's a mask and people wear masks at Halloween.
[12:48.680 --> 12:49.600]  Oh, yeah.
[12:49.660 --> 12:52.300]  But kind of like all the pictures that Eric is putting up in the chat.
[12:52.320 --> 12:55.120]  OK, before before you throw this down, the whole job,
[12:55.440 --> 12:58.740]  they bring up the Pantin Collection when you're in one of these all hands.
[12:58.740 --> 13:02.000]  There's a chat that people can write into to pops up on the screen
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.700]  and everyone's going, oh, the monstrosity.
[13:05.120 --> 13:07.000]  Oh, look at this horrendous face.
[13:07.180 --> 13:09.800]  Look at the burn. This should burn.
[13:10.080 --> 13:11.180]  This is a terrible thing.
[13:11.420 --> 13:13.040]  And I'm watching this good Jesus Christ.
[13:13.100 --> 13:14.200]  This is my first all hands.
[13:14.360 --> 13:15.880]  I've missed 85 of these.
[13:16.280 --> 13:19.240]  I got the whole company shitting on me like it is.
[13:19.320 --> 13:20.660]  It is a monstrosity.
[13:20.720 --> 13:24.360]  But technically speaking, it's still just a photo of my face.
[13:24.600 --> 13:27.620]  And all these people are Frankenstein.
[13:27.620 --> 13:30.480]  We got Frankenstein on sale over here.
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.220]  Listen, Frankenstein, I think you have a lovely face.
[13:34.480 --> 13:37.040]  But if I and you know, it's a lovely face.
[13:37.100 --> 13:39.220]  Gavin, Gavin has a lovely face.
[13:39.300 --> 13:42.160]  But if we made a mask, a balaclava of Gavin and wore it,
[13:42.180 --> 13:45.460]  it would be hideous and disgusting and people would throw rocks at him.
[13:46.020 --> 13:50.700]  It's just when you when you stretch a face over your face, it's shocking.
[13:51.640 --> 13:54.500]  Watching people's lips come through like some people
[13:54.500 --> 13:55.200]  you can see.
[13:55.400 --> 13:58.940]  You can tell that the mask is really tight and the lips are just bulging.
[13:59.200 --> 14:02.260]  And I think my favorite part is if there's any facial hair on the real
[14:02.260 --> 14:03.620]  like above the real lips.
[14:03.860 --> 14:07.240]  It's very obvious because the facial hair ends on the mask
[14:07.720 --> 14:10.700]  becomes like skin and then goes back to being a real.
[14:12.640 --> 14:16.780]  It's it's essentially it's the claim that my face belongs in a Halloween town
[14:16.780 --> 14:17.720]  is how I took it.
[14:18.020 --> 14:18.740]  It was very fun.
[14:18.980 --> 14:21.140]  Just the idea that all this is Halloween merch.
[14:21.140 --> 14:25.360]  And then August 25th, the last part of the Halloween collection.
[14:25.820 --> 14:27.440]  Me. Well, Andrew Pantin.
[14:28.120 --> 14:29.160]  Let me say this.
[14:29.220 --> 14:31.600]  Let me say this, Andrew, if this helps.
[14:32.260 --> 14:34.260]  Success is the best revenge.
[14:34.440 --> 14:39.120]  And your Andrew Pantin collection sold out in about 45 minutes.
[14:40.140 --> 14:43.560]  And I don't think any of those other collections will sell out.
[14:44.780 --> 14:47.220]  I personally think that we need to be more discerning
[14:47.220 --> 14:49.120]  about who's coming to the all hands meeting. That's all.
[14:51.340 --> 14:52.640]  You think I'm not getting invited?
[14:53.080 --> 14:55.860]  You're going to go to you're going to we're going to look at some invitations.
[14:56.260 --> 14:58.300]  Yeah, I just think like, you know, you got to like
[14:58.820 --> 15:01.020]  if they're not coming anyway, you know, just weed them out.
[15:01.240 --> 15:02.980]  And listen, I should get the invite.
[15:03.400 --> 15:05.680]  I'm sure I didn't anticipate a company roasting.
[15:06.060 --> 15:09.320]  Look, if we're going to shit on Andrew Pantin every all hands, I'll be there.
[15:10.280 --> 15:12.380]  Well, that's what it takes for you to be there.
[15:12.580 --> 15:14.040]  That's amazing. Yeah.
[15:14.100 --> 15:17.280]  If we do, we just had a little section of the segment
[15:17.280 --> 15:21.640]  ended, Gavin, with with Geoff was wearing this pumpkin mask.
[15:21.780 --> 15:25.600]  Other Geoff, not other Geoff, Geoff was wearing a pumpkin mask and he took it off
[15:25.600 --> 15:27.920]  to reveal he was wearing my face mask and yelled
[15:27.920 --> 15:31.660]  he should return to the pits of hell where he came from.
[15:31.860 --> 15:34.080]  That's me. That's just me.
[15:34.720 --> 15:37.420]  That's just I'm a person.
[15:37.520 --> 15:38.700]  Now, here's the thing.
[15:38.900 --> 15:41.600]  If you look at the images that I've posted.
[15:42.160 --> 15:43.340]  No, I wouldn't say that.
[15:43.340 --> 15:45.820]  I wouldn't say that you need to go to hell.
[15:45.820 --> 15:49.060]  But I will say that if you're wearing this mask, maybe
[15:50.840 --> 15:52.600]  hell ain't a bad place to be.
[15:54.340 --> 15:55.620]  So you're not wrong.
[15:55.740 --> 15:56.620]  And I get it.
[15:57.160 --> 16:00.260]  But I just you know, I learned, I think from the experience that took away,
[16:00.340 --> 16:01.540]  maybe the all hands aren't for me.
[16:02.120 --> 16:03.360]  Maybe I'm not supposed to be here.
[16:05.140 --> 16:08.340]  Well, if you were troubled by that one, you would have hated the previous
[16:08.340 --> 16:10.100]  eighty five because they went easy on you this month.
[16:12.220 --> 16:15.340]  With that being said, I still want to win one of these cock awards
[16:15.340 --> 16:16.480]  that I've been seeing for years.
[16:16.600 --> 16:17.880]  I'm excited. Maybe you'll make it.
[16:18.060 --> 16:19.120]  And when do they do it?
[16:19.180 --> 16:20.940]  December of Nick, nominate you.
[16:21.240 --> 16:22.300]  Yeah. Do you know how that works?
[16:22.360 --> 16:25.020]  If your producer thinks you do a really, really good job, he can.
[16:25.220 --> 16:26.120]  He or she can nominate you.
[16:26.720 --> 16:29.800]  Well, OK, well, this I'm glad that, you know, we're here and this is a public
[16:29.800 --> 16:32.120]  platform. I know some people at the company watch this show.
[16:32.280 --> 16:35.020]  So I made a little presentation
[16:35.600 --> 16:39.440]  on why I deserve to win one of these cock awards that I'd love to share with you
[16:39.440 --> 16:42.040]  guys. We still haven't even gotten your potato fact.
[16:42.080 --> 16:43.900]  We're really getting deep dived.
[16:44.420 --> 16:48.380]  Yeah, well, I'll just I'll share my entire screen, I guess, because why not?
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.220]  Sweet. I think that cock award is in your pocket for 20.
[16:52.260 --> 16:55.000]  I'm feeling good in your pocket.
[16:55.460 --> 16:57.900]  You're still using the browser version.
[16:58.360 --> 17:00.540]  Of course. I always use the browser version.
[17:00.660 --> 17:03.060]  Are we all? Why? Andrew deserves a cock.
[17:03.460 --> 17:04.600]  Why, Andrew?
[17:05.100 --> 17:07.320]  That's loading. Why Andrew deserves a cock?
[17:07.340 --> 17:10.120]  A humble but factual presentation.
[17:10.540 --> 17:12.360]  OK, I'm compiling this.
[17:12.360 --> 17:14.240]  I think I make some persuasive.
[17:14.420 --> 17:15.860]  There's around 10 points in this.
[17:15.980 --> 17:18.220]  I feel pretty persuasive. First point.
[17:19.380 --> 17:21.780]  I have hands, not a requirement.
[17:22.340 --> 17:24.620]  I just wanted to clarify due to my lack of all hands appearances.
[17:25.020 --> 17:26.240]  Those are not my hands.
[17:26.780 --> 17:28.060]  Those are just hands.
[17:28.480 --> 17:29.240]  Those aren't just hands.
[17:29.360 --> 17:30.460]  Those aren't thumb hands.
[17:30.840 --> 17:32.300]  Those aren't just hands.
[17:32.800 --> 17:35.060]  Well, we talked about long thumbs in the past.
[17:35.380 --> 17:39.400]  I felt it was a comfortable time to put some some long thumbs in there.
[17:39.920 --> 17:41.460]  And I just I mainly just want to say, hey,
[17:41.460 --> 17:44.840]  I know I haven't had my hands in the huddle, but I do have hands.
[17:45.160 --> 17:46.800]  I am. I'm willing to help.
[17:46.920 --> 17:47.660]  I'm a team guy.
[17:48.020 --> 17:48.900]  That one company guy.
[17:49.380 --> 17:51.340]  That left hand has a cocaine fingernail.
[17:51.760 --> 17:53.680]  Does it? Oh, yeah. Right.
[17:54.040 --> 17:57.180]  Oh, yeah. Point number two.
[17:57.860 --> 17:58.660]  No priors.
[17:58.840 --> 18:00.760]  As you can see, my criminal record to the right.
[18:01.820 --> 18:03.460]  Zero child kickings reported.
[18:04.160 --> 18:05.460]  Didn't do nothing.
[18:05.700 --> 18:07.100]  Looking at my criminal record.
[18:07.180 --> 18:08.300]  There's nothing there. It's blank.
[18:08.900 --> 18:09.700]  I didn't do anything.
[18:10.260 --> 18:12.760]  I'm an innocent, honorable man.
[18:13.100 --> 18:14.300]  I've done nothing wrong.
[18:14.980 --> 18:16.640]  You and I think that's important to show.
[18:16.880 --> 18:20.620]  Wait, you didn't you think that you should win an award
[18:20.620 --> 18:23.960]  because you didn't do nothing criminal wise?
[18:24.280 --> 18:26.800]  Well, just I'm saying I'm a good representative, OK?
[18:26.860 --> 18:31.100]  There's no stuff in my past or no skeletons in his closet.
[18:31.300 --> 18:32.980]  Exactly. It's clean.
[18:33.080 --> 18:35.240]  Now, Raymond Sommer, don't look into that.
[18:35.380 --> 18:36.620]  Oh, Johnny Caviar.
[18:36.920 --> 18:38.900]  Yeah. Oh, boy.
[18:38.900 --> 18:40.960]  But he's not trying to win a cock award.
[18:41.220 --> 18:42.420]  He's trying to win a cock.
[18:43.380 --> 18:45.000]  Point number three.
[18:45.960 --> 18:47.660]  I subscribed to Game Kids.
[18:47.980 --> 18:51.120]  I supported this company and a wife who did.
[18:51.820 --> 18:55.360]  OK, I was there on the front lines.
[18:55.700 --> 18:57.700]  I went to the fucking panel at RTX.
[18:58.440 --> 18:59.360]  I showed up.
[18:59.660 --> 19:02.780]  I supported hands on deck, as some may say.
[19:03.120 --> 19:04.380]  Yeah, that's good. Yeah.
[19:04.720 --> 19:07.580]  This may have been a successful brand if there were more people like me.
[19:07.580 --> 19:08.180]  Uh-huh.
[19:09.860 --> 19:10.620]  Point number four.
[19:11.520 --> 19:12.620]  I am an honorable man.
[19:12.880 --> 19:16.520]  I never subscribed to Game Kids, but it's pretty cool that I admitted that.
[19:16.800 --> 19:17.820]  I didn't have to.
[19:18.140 --> 19:20.020]  You all would have just assumed that was true.
[19:20.220 --> 19:21.420]  Yeah, we can verify that.
[19:21.620 --> 19:22.380]  Yeah. Yeah.
[19:22.520 --> 19:23.500]  Well, I know you wouldn't know that.
[19:23.800 --> 19:24.740]  I'm an honorable man.
[19:25.000 --> 19:25.640]  I should have.
[19:26.140 --> 19:27.520]  It was a mistake by me.
[19:28.020 --> 19:30.540]  No disrespect to you, Geoff, the channel and all that.
[19:30.620 --> 19:32.840]  I know. Listen, it was great.
[19:33.060 --> 19:34.400]  I enjoyed it for what it was.
[19:35.040 --> 19:38.160]  Hey, it filled, it served its purpose at the time.
[19:38.600 --> 19:39.700]  It did. It was great.
[19:39.900 --> 19:40.640]  Point number five.
[19:41.040 --> 19:42.760]  Look at that. Who do you see there?
[19:43.520 --> 19:46.540]  Jerry West. Jerry West, NBA logo.
[19:46.740 --> 19:49.720]  Everybody knows he's won lots of awards, recognized, respected.
[19:51.480 --> 19:52.640]  On the griffball logo.
[19:53.380 --> 19:54.100]  Prove that I'm not.
[19:55.740 --> 19:56.960]  I didn't win any awards.
[19:57.500 --> 20:01.100]  You are doing this in the only place where the actual person
[20:01.100 --> 20:02.540]  from the griffball logo could be.
[20:02.680 --> 20:03.400]  Yeah, I don't know.
[20:03.400 --> 20:04.780]  Isn't that Geoff?
[20:05.060 --> 20:07.160]  No, he's Griff. He's Griff.
[20:07.520 --> 20:09.740]  That's not Griff. That's the griffball logo.
[20:10.240 --> 20:11.160]  What do you mean that's not Griff?
[20:11.440 --> 20:15.820]  What you just showed was an example of the guy who was the logo.
[20:16.080 --> 20:20.200]  And now you're showing us the logo with the guy who is the logo in this call.
[20:20.300 --> 20:21.700]  And you're going, nah, that's not him.
[20:22.320 --> 20:26.620]  Well, so if you get on a conference call with Jerry West,
[20:26.720 --> 20:28.180]  you're like, prove that's you.
[20:28.420 --> 20:30.640]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[20:30.640 --> 20:32.380]  It's getting in a conference call with Jerry West.
[20:32.380 --> 20:34.440]  It's like, prove that's not me.
[20:37.720 --> 20:39.520]  Like, Geoff is here right now.
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.820]  Every other place on the earth would be a better place to make that point.
[20:45.560 --> 20:47.880]  Right now, I think I think it's salient.
[20:48.000 --> 20:49.280]  So we'll just agree to disagree.
[20:49.640 --> 20:53.320]  I will say I will say in your defense, you were the best griffball
[20:53.320 --> 20:56.540]  runner in the world for a brief time for a brief time.
[20:56.760 --> 20:58.240]  Yeah. Brief time.
[20:58.640 --> 21:01.600]  It used to be me. And then then I met you and I had to retire.
[21:01.600 --> 21:04.880]  Well, when you say when you say you're the one that was there before me
[21:04.880 --> 21:06.120]  at the bar is a lot lower.
[21:06.200 --> 21:07.880]  I didn't like I get what you're doing, but
[21:08.540 --> 21:12.000]  I feel like that really chopped the legs out of the brief time
[21:12.000 --> 21:13.380]  that I was number one.
[21:13.780 --> 21:15.640]  Let's not chop Griff's legs off, please.
[21:16.120 --> 21:18.060]  No. Point six.
[21:19.300 --> 21:22.120]  I didn't make publicly make fun of the rebrand.
[21:22.640 --> 21:25.020]  A lot of people got jokes off, but not me.
[21:25.840 --> 21:28.580]  A lot of people say things about Red Rooster.
[21:28.940 --> 21:31.260]  You think you're doing now, but all right, great.
[21:31.260 --> 21:32.960]  No, I'm just I'm saying I did not.
[21:33.100 --> 21:34.780]  I think Geoff asked me how I feel about it.
[21:35.520 --> 21:38.100]  I don't know how. Yeah, exactly.
[21:38.300 --> 21:41.840]  I'm Gavin asked me how I feel about arm's distance on this one, bud.
[21:42.660 --> 21:44.120]  Asked me how I feel about it. Anyone.
[21:44.600 --> 21:46.420]  How do you get you closer to the cock?
[21:46.880 --> 21:51.020]  I think this is I think it's a great logo that makes me
[21:51.020 --> 21:53.860]  it makes me excited and happy to watch content.
[21:54.080 --> 21:54.900]  That's how I feel about it.
[21:54.940 --> 21:55.440]  It's awesome.
[21:57.260 --> 21:58.120]  Still honorable.
[21:58.420 --> 22:00.480]  I did tweet one joke about it,
[22:00.480 --> 22:03.600]  but that was a tweet Twitter doesn't technically exist anymore.
[22:03.860 --> 22:05.400]  So I don't think that this actually.
[22:05.680 --> 22:09.820]  OK, so you didn't make any jokes about it except for the one joke you made about it
[22:09.820 --> 22:12.820]  and also what you're currently doing right now.
[22:12.900 --> 22:14.860]  OK, no, but that was a tweet.
[22:14.980 --> 22:17.260]  And as I said, tweets don't exist anymore.
[22:17.340 --> 22:18.720]  So I think I get a pass on this.
[22:19.020 --> 22:20.280]  I appreciate your honesty.
[22:20.600 --> 22:22.140]  The company still honorable.
[22:22.300 --> 22:23.520]  It's really important.
[22:23.920 --> 22:26.920]  Number eight paid for shipping from the store.
[22:27.580 --> 22:29.460]  It's it's shipping costs a lot.
[22:29.460 --> 22:31.540]  I'm in Canada. Things cost money.
[22:32.120 --> 22:33.280]  First off, you idiot.
[22:33.640 --> 22:35.460]  Any one of us would have said that to you for free.
[22:35.780 --> 22:37.680]  Yeah. And that just you're just paying a shipping company.
[22:38.100 --> 22:41.220]  Yeah, but I'm just saying like I'm like that's not helping Rooster Teeth.
[22:41.460 --> 22:42.340]  It's people people.
[22:42.600 --> 22:44.800]  By the way, people think that Rooster Teeth is like
[22:45.380 --> 22:47.520]  taking all the shipping money and keeping it.
[22:47.560 --> 22:50.760]  It goes to the it goes to handle shipping and handle.
[22:51.040 --> 22:55.240]  No, my point is that that's how dedicated I am to our show in this company
[22:55.240 --> 22:57.500]  that I would pay the shipping in Canada as a Canadian.
[22:57.500 --> 22:59.120]  It doesn't do anything for us.
[22:59.120 --> 23:01.820]  That's the definition of selling of a button.
[23:02.420 --> 23:05.300]  Here's here's where here's where here's.
[23:05.840 --> 23:07.360]  I wish you hadn't put number eight in.
[23:07.640 --> 23:10.140]  Because here's the promise to the DHL all hands.
[23:10.300 --> 23:11.900]  They'd be really happy with it.
[23:12.060 --> 23:16.460]  Well, FedEx is going to FedEx is going to promote you to MVP of the year.
[23:16.900 --> 23:18.800]  UPS all hands is still roasting Andrew.
[23:18.920 --> 23:21.060]  They're wearing his mask and making fun of him when he's fucked up.
[23:22.140 --> 23:25.600]  I'd rather you work smarter than harder and just say, hey,
[23:25.600 --> 23:27.440]  I really want to support us with a sound button.
[23:27.940 --> 23:29.860]  Can I have can you send me one?
[23:30.020 --> 23:33.140]  I since I helped invent it and absolutely we would send it to you.
[23:33.240 --> 23:35.160]  Well, yeah, it's not that I don't think you'd send it.
[23:35.200 --> 23:37.720]  I just I like to listen, especially at this time.
[23:37.780 --> 23:39.980]  I was buying all the merch because I wanted to
[23:39.980 --> 23:42.800]  because I'd never been part of a show and I was excited about it.
[23:42.960 --> 23:43.580]  You know what, Andrew?
[23:43.700 --> 23:44.680]  Here's what I'm going to say to that.
[23:44.900 --> 23:48.100]  I'm going to walk my criticism back because sitting here thinking about it,
[23:48.100 --> 23:50.620]  I buy stuff from the Roostery store all the time as well.
[23:50.980 --> 23:53.360]  Yeah, I mean, I'm not in Canada, so it's way cheaper to get it.
[23:53.380 --> 23:54.280]  That's what I do.
[23:54.360 --> 23:56.280]  I do buy stuff and pay full U.S.
[23:56.280 --> 23:59.080]  shipping probably once a month to be clear.
[23:59.200 --> 24:00.240]  I'm not saying it's their fault.
[24:00.360 --> 24:01.760]  The shipping is the way it is. I'm a candidate.
[24:01.920 --> 24:02.360]  It's far away.
[24:02.400 --> 24:06.220]  I'm just my point is, is that's how determined I am to support the show.
[24:06.380 --> 24:09.440]  I'll pay for shipping prices for a thing that I work for.
[24:09.640 --> 24:10.880]  All right. The intent of it.
[24:10.960 --> 24:11.900]  Number eight, number nine.
[24:12.500 --> 24:14.980]  This would be the first legitimate trophy win for Face.
[24:15.100 --> 24:16.000]  I think it looks pretty good.
[24:16.200 --> 24:18.560]  I think that looks pretty, pretty beautiful to me.
[24:18.720 --> 24:20.660]  Isn't an alleged scam like other award shows?
[24:21.440 --> 24:23.720]  I'm not saying other award shows were a scam.
[24:25.200 --> 24:26.460]  It's an alleged thing.
[24:26.640 --> 24:31.000]  I feel like we gave a company money to give us a silver award
[24:31.520 --> 24:34.680]  and say we're second and we didn't get a trophy for it.
[24:34.800 --> 24:36.980]  But this is a FIBA dream.
[24:38.400 --> 24:39.300]  It's an alleged scam.
[24:39.640 --> 24:40.720]  And this would be first legitimate win.
[24:40.740 --> 24:43.440]  I don't think we've won, in my opinion, a legitimate trophy.
[24:43.520 --> 24:44.860]  Is Face, I could be wrong about that.
[24:45.120 --> 24:46.060]  No, I don't think we have.
[24:46.140 --> 24:50.400]  We got a silver place medal along with 87 other sites.
[24:50.960 --> 24:53.940]  Can a show win an employee award, though?
[24:54.940 --> 24:58.140]  Well, I would win it because of my presence on the show,
[24:58.220 --> 24:59.800]  because it's the only thing I do here.
[24:59.920 --> 25:02.980]  So I feel like it would be a f*** Face award.
[25:03.760 --> 25:03.840]  I agree.
[25:04.280 --> 25:06.800]  I think he's an emissary of the of the production.
[25:07.480 --> 25:10.960]  And which is why the lack of child kickings is important.
[25:11.100 --> 25:11.480]  I'm representing.
[25:11.740 --> 25:14.160]  So Eric, is he closer to the nomination, in your opinion?
[25:14.540 --> 25:16.680]  Not with Fact, not after Fact 9.
[25:16.800 --> 25:17.780]  That could be any of us.
[25:17.940 --> 25:19.540]  That's that's saying like Nick wins.
[25:19.660 --> 25:20.220]  You know what I mean?
[25:20.220 --> 25:22.780]  Like that's you know, that doesn't I would be happy about that.
[25:22.820 --> 25:24.300]  If any of us won, to be clear.
[25:24.420 --> 25:26.800]  What if it's between you and Nick and Nick wins?
[25:27.060 --> 25:27.520]  Are you going to be?
[25:27.520 --> 25:27.900]  Thank you.
[25:28.040 --> 25:28.300]  Oh, yeah.
[25:28.340 --> 25:29.780]  No, I'd be if Nick wins.
[25:29.860 --> 25:30.480]  Yeah. Over me.
[25:30.620 --> 25:31.360]  100 percent.
[25:31.440 --> 25:32.700]  Nick, Nick, Nick.
[25:33.100 --> 25:34.100]  You got my vote, buddy.
[25:34.240 --> 25:36.380]  I think I think we might have to nominate Nick.
[25:36.420 --> 25:39.880]  But that wouldn't be for f*** Face, because Nick works on all the F brands.
[25:40.000 --> 25:40.680]  That's true.
[25:40.800 --> 25:41.860]  That is the problem, Nick.
[25:42.260 --> 25:44.440]  He isn't as narrowly focused as I am.
[25:45.000 --> 25:46.980]  Yeah, but I'm a part of most of those F brands.
[25:47.080 --> 25:48.760]  So yeah, it's still a win for me.
[25:48.760 --> 25:51.060]  Like his own podcast and everything, you know what I mean?
[25:51.340 --> 25:54.220]  Yeah, I couldn't help but notice that that was in the feed.
[25:54.880 --> 25:56.640]  Hey, let's deal with the PowerPoint.
[25:57.640 --> 25:59.740]  And it sounds like someone went back on their vote.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.520]  Hey, let's deal with the PowerPoint at hand.
[26:02.620 --> 26:05.160]  OK, and then we can get into that.
[26:05.500 --> 26:08.940]  OK, and the last point is the slide or two, maybe after that.
[26:08.940 --> 26:11.240]  But the last point, I think this is the one that's most powerful.
[26:11.380 --> 26:13.900]  Some of you do not seem all that convinced so far,
[26:13.940 --> 26:16.380]  but I think this will really bring you over the line.
[26:16.380 --> 26:20.240]  How can you continue to deny this beautiful face?
[26:20.300 --> 26:21.640]  How can you say no to this?
[26:22.300 --> 26:23.720]  How can you say no to that?
[26:24.300 --> 26:26.360]  Is that you wearing?
[26:26.580 --> 26:27.960]  That's me wearing my face.
[26:28.060 --> 26:32.660]  I will say the face is a little snug as a big headed individual.
[26:33.060 --> 26:34.960]  It was it's it's a problem.
[26:34.960 --> 26:36.280]  The face is a problem.
[26:36.640 --> 26:38.800]  Look, the nice thing is up top.
[26:38.900 --> 26:40.340]  You've got room for more thoughts.
[26:40.820 --> 26:44.360]  There's yeah, as you can see, it's not very full, though.
[26:44.360 --> 26:46.340]  That space is pretty vacant.
[26:46.660 --> 26:48.800]  Why is the top of the head completely empty?
[26:49.460 --> 26:50.640]  Because it was.
[26:50.920 --> 26:55.080]  Listen, I was choking out my nose, which thank Christ, it's unbreakable.
[26:55.360 --> 26:57.860]  Because if it was, it would have shattered in a million pieces.
[26:58.120 --> 26:59.860]  Trying to get this head piece out.
[27:00.020 --> 27:03.800]  This is the first picture of you that I've seen since we started this podcast.
[27:04.720 --> 27:05.300]  That's not true.
[27:06.860 --> 27:10.160]  I've never seen I've never seen the facial hair in my life.
[27:10.340 --> 27:11.380]  I've heard about it.
[27:11.940 --> 27:12.420]  That's not true.
[27:12.540 --> 27:13.160]  I think you beard fatter.
[27:15.120 --> 27:15.800]  Did you listen?
[27:15.940 --> 27:17.260]  You don't fucking remember the arcade.
[27:17.340 --> 27:18.800]  You're not going to remember the fact that I sent you.
[27:19.460 --> 27:20.300]  He's got you there.
[27:20.300 --> 27:23.320]  You also don't remember that you recanted and said that you were totally fine
[27:23.320 --> 27:24.840]  with us posting it on the face channel.
[27:25.300 --> 27:26.220]  I did. Yeah.
[27:26.340 --> 27:27.000]  You know, I remember it.
[27:27.040 --> 27:27.660]  No, totally.
[27:28.080 --> 27:28.880]  Oh, no, you are.
[27:28.960 --> 27:29.680]  You weren't there, Andrew.
[27:29.720 --> 27:30.680]  It was after you.
[27:30.900 --> 27:32.380]  OK, I said it to me and Eric.
[27:32.420 --> 27:32.900]  We both heard it.
[27:32.920 --> 27:34.460]  We remember it's a lot of bollocks.
[27:34.620 --> 27:35.900]  And you just don't remember.
[27:36.480 --> 27:38.200]  OK, number one slide.
[27:38.880 --> 27:43.220]  Pant in 2023, bringing democracy to the democracy
[27:43.870 --> 27:47.660]  or company that is always talking about how important it is
[27:47.660 --> 27:51.180]  to have the support of the community, yet they have no say
[27:51.180 --> 27:53.220]  in these cock trophies going out.
[27:53.980 --> 27:57.180]  So, you know, if you feel I've made some salient points,
[27:57.260 --> 28:01.660]  is the listeners watch or feel free to support my effort
[28:01.660 --> 28:03.620]  in winning a cock award in 2023.
[28:04.180 --> 28:05.200]  Thank you so much.
[28:05.300 --> 28:07.620]  So, Eric, when you nominate someone for this
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.220]  cock thing, do you have to justify the choice to anyone?
[28:11.420 --> 28:13.840]  I mean, you probably like write like a little blurb.
[28:13.900 --> 28:15.300]  It's not like I've ever nominated anyone.
[28:15.640 --> 28:16.400]  You haven't. Why?
[28:17.220 --> 28:17.660]  Why would I?
[28:18.460 --> 28:19.480]  I should be winning them.
[28:19.540 --> 28:20.720]  I don't need to nominate anyone.
[28:20.800 --> 28:21.980]  Yeah, you can't nominate himself.
[28:22.120 --> 28:23.080]  And who am I going to write?
[28:23.140 --> 28:23.960]  Eric, great job.
[28:24.020 --> 28:24.740]  Like, what am I going to do?
[28:24.740 --> 28:29.020]  Make a 12 slide PowerPoint presentation about why you win an internal award.
[28:29.620 --> 28:33.940]  So if my boss, which is you, doesn't want to nominate, he only wants to win.
[28:34.240 --> 28:36.000]  Does that mean no one beneath him can win?
[28:36.660 --> 28:40.020]  I don't I don't have to necessarily nominate you.
[28:40.160 --> 28:41.340]  Other people can nominate you.
[28:41.540 --> 28:44.040]  Yeah, Gavin, you could nominate Andrew if you wanted to.
[28:44.080 --> 28:46.300]  Yeah, we could all agree to nominate Nick.
[28:46.500 --> 28:48.120]  Exactly. We can all nominate Nick.
[28:48.440 --> 28:50.300]  So, wow. OK, OK.
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.220]  Yeah, I love Nick.
[28:52.600 --> 28:55.000]  And that that's my that's my presentation.
[28:55.420 --> 28:56.560]  Let me ask you a question.
[28:57.240 --> 29:00.200]  Let me first off, Andrew, I think it's a phenomenal presentation.
[29:00.340 --> 29:01.560]  And really good.
[29:01.560 --> 29:06.260]  If I wasn't already dead set on nominating Nick,
[29:06.560 --> 29:09.540]  I would you would be in the running.
[29:10.120 --> 29:10.780]  I agree with that.
[29:11.520 --> 29:14.700]  In the running of all employees who are currently work at the company,
[29:14.760 --> 29:17.000]  you would definitely be one of them in the running.
[29:19.880 --> 29:22.760]  Amongst amongst the others, you would definitely be in
[29:22.760 --> 29:25.000]  in that mix in some small fashion.
[29:26.420 --> 29:28.680]  But I think but I think it's I think it's awesome.
[29:28.820 --> 29:30.100]  I here's here's my question for you.
[29:30.420 --> 29:34.260]  And I'm not recommending we do this, but the thought popped into my head.
[29:34.340 --> 29:36.580]  And we were we were talking about the Cockbite of the Year Award
[29:36.580 --> 29:39.760]  and you were giving us this thorough presentation.
[29:40.440 --> 29:44.080]  If we were to have our own award that we not we hand out at the end of the year.
[29:44.100 --> 29:45.420]  And I'm not saying that we should do this
[29:45.420 --> 29:47.500]  because this is a bit that Rooster Teeth has done in the past.
[29:47.600 --> 29:49.940]  The podcast had its own awards years ago.
[29:50.100 --> 29:52.520]  We made a dumb trophy with a beer can. It was a whole thing.
[29:53.080 --> 29:58.360]  But if we were to have a face award, what would it be like a potato of the year?
[29:59.480 --> 30:03.000]  I thought you meant what would it like be physically represented as?
[30:03.080 --> 30:05.880]  And it's just your melted Cosmic Crisp in my head.
[30:06.180 --> 30:06.800]  That was in the fridge.
[30:06.900 --> 30:08.660]  Would it be like a bag of Cosmic Crisp?
[30:09.420 --> 30:13.440]  Bag of melted, melted, awful Cosmic Crisp would be the trophy.
[30:13.920 --> 30:16.460]  I think it should be that picture of Andrew wearing his own mask,
[30:16.580 --> 30:19.160]  but in like a crystal. Yeah.
[30:21.180 --> 30:24.580]  Oh, like a bronze or silver kind of like plaque kind of thing.
[30:24.800 --> 30:27.460]  Like those those things you get at the mall where it's like
[30:28.020 --> 30:29.160]  it's like inside the.
[30:29.700 --> 30:31.620]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[30:31.820 --> 30:33.260]  That would be real bad.
[30:33.900 --> 30:35.660]  That'd be real cool. Well.

[31:30.550 --> 31:33.190]  But just because they're easy, that doesn't mean they're they're

[32:04.230 --> 32:06.630]  Do you ever find that just as you're trying to fall asleep,
[32:06.750 --> 32:08.330]  your brain suddenly won't stop talking?
[32:08.650 --> 32:12.070]  Your thoughts start racing right before bed or at other inopportune moments?
[32:12.590 --> 32:16.150]  I find that happens a lot to me, especially on a night
[32:16.150 --> 32:20.130]  where it's super important I get a lot of sleep or just get well rested.
[32:21.370 --> 32:23.450]  It's I don't know if it's an anxiety thing.
[32:23.570 --> 32:25.370]  It could be all sorts of different processes.
[32:25.370 --> 32:27.790]  It doesn't happen always for that reason either.
[32:27.970 --> 32:29.730]  But just sometimes it's tough to shut off.
[32:29.850 --> 32:34.450]  In my experience, I found working through those thoughts can help
[32:34.450 --> 32:37.130]  as well as like rain sounds is something that works for me.
[32:37.230 --> 32:38.230]  But everybody's different.
[32:38.410 --> 32:41.910]  And it's a process that I imagine most of us go through.
[32:42.410 --> 32:45.190]  It turns out one great way to make those racing thoughts go away
[32:45.190 --> 32:46.030]  is to talk them through.
[32:46.690 --> 32:49.330]  Therapy gives you a place to do that so you can get out of your negative
[32:49.330 --> 32:52.670]  thought cycles and find some mental and emotional peace.
[32:53.450 --> 32:55.070]  Therapy is something that
[32:56.150 --> 32:59.790]  has helped me tremendously, as I say, every time I do these, because it's true
[33:00.930 --> 33:02.410]  in ways that's unexpected.
[33:02.610 --> 33:07.370]  Sometimes I've had areas of my life where I felt like I had a pretty good handle
[33:07.370 --> 33:07.950]  on things.
[33:08.070 --> 33:11.270]  And then in the process of seeking professional help,
[33:11.270 --> 33:14.990]  it has given me perspective that has completely reshifted
[33:15.590 --> 33:19.590]  my thinking of what actually I'm struggling with or what I'm going through.
[33:20.570 --> 33:25.190]  And without that, I, you know, it's tough to when you think you have a shoulder
[33:25.190 --> 33:28.070]  injury, but it turns out you have a knee injury, but you've been treating
[33:28.070 --> 33:30.910]  the shoulder like it's tough to actually heal what's wrong.
[33:31.990 --> 33:35.290]  So I'd highly recommend the experience to anyone to give it a shot.
[33:36.010 --> 33:38.930]  And if you're thinking of starting therapy, give better help a try.

[34:02.990 --> 34:04.630]  So you put your show in the feed, huh?
[34:04.890 --> 34:06.370]  What? So you put your show?
[34:06.550 --> 34:08.130]  So here's the deal. Here's the deal.
[34:08.430 --> 34:12.090]  They say it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.
[34:12.310 --> 34:15.810]  But some of us find it's easy to ask for both. Huh.
[34:17.570 --> 34:20.610]  OK, I'd like to say that I didn't have anything to do with that.
[34:21.130 --> 34:23.970]  Would you like to say it because you couldn't say that?
[34:24.270 --> 34:25.750]  Like, yeah, that's what you're saying.
[34:26.370 --> 34:30.090]  I'd like to say that I wasn't involved in that decision.
[34:30.210 --> 34:32.150]  I would like to say that doesn't mean you're not.
[34:32.490 --> 34:35.710]  The real face move was obviously in the episode where we where it's funnier
[34:35.710 --> 34:36.350]  to not do it.
[34:36.790 --> 34:38.910]  You know, I totally agree. It was funnier to not do it.
[34:39.050 --> 34:39.890]  I'm right there with you.
[34:40.190 --> 34:41.790]  But I'd like to say I would.
[34:41.850 --> 34:44.850]  I would like to say that I wasn't involved in the decision to go back on that.
[34:44.850 --> 34:47.470]  100% want to be able to say that with you.
[34:47.570 --> 34:48.690]  Eric's not saying anything.
[34:49.630 --> 34:50.670]  What do you want me to say?
[34:50.890 --> 34:54.230]  I said, hey, do you want a Nick said that we want to upload this
[34:54.230 --> 34:55.310]  because it'll help numbers.
[34:55.650 --> 34:56.630]  How do you feel about that?
[34:56.730 --> 34:58.390]  And just said, yeah, go for it.
[34:58.510 --> 35:02.250]  Huh. OK, but the point still stands.
[35:02.830 --> 35:03.730]  The point still stands.
[35:03.850 --> 35:06.910]  I would like to be able to say that I didn't say that.
[35:07.430 --> 35:09.490]  I just write. I respect that a lot.
[35:10.130 --> 35:12.990]  But I want to be I want to be able to say I listen.
[35:12.990 --> 35:14.030]  How about this?
[35:14.290 --> 35:15.890]  How about this, Gavin?
[35:16.150 --> 35:17.590]  Andrew? Uh-huh.
[35:17.810 --> 35:19.190]  This is your old pal, Geoff.
[35:19.350 --> 35:22.410]  You've known me for more than half of both of your lives.
[35:22.530 --> 35:24.690]  We've been friends for a very long time. Big time.
[35:25.230 --> 35:28.450]  Gavin, I've known I've known you for going on two decades now.
[35:28.570 --> 35:29.910]  Maybe maybe close to 20 years.
[35:30.250 --> 35:31.370]  Oh, actually, more than 20 years.
[35:31.450 --> 35:33.110]  I've known you. Is that right? No.
[35:33.450 --> 35:35.410]  How well we met. We met in 2005.
[35:36.010 --> 35:37.410]  Yeah, it's been 18 years.
[35:37.970 --> 35:39.830]  And I knew you online a little bit before that.
[35:39.830 --> 35:42.190]  Uh, I'm sorry.
[35:43.910 --> 35:46.170]  Forgive me, please.
[35:46.170 --> 35:47.270]  No, yeah, we're good.
[35:47.870 --> 35:50.450]  Sorry. I feel bad.
[35:50.790 --> 35:53.450]  I oh, oopsie.
[35:53.850 --> 35:55.630]  I actually might be mad at Geoff now.
[35:55.770 --> 35:58.650]  I might be. I wish I hadn't done it.
[35:58.710 --> 36:01.670]  But I did change the past.
[36:02.190 --> 36:03.870]  Forgive Geoff.
[36:04.350 --> 36:06.870]  Wearing headphones for that made me feel sick.
[36:07.250 --> 36:08.530]  Yeah, I don't like it.
[36:08.530 --> 36:10.950]  That may have been the worst thing I've ever heard.
[36:11.650 --> 36:14.990]  Yeah, I was going to say this is why I never apologize.
[36:15.390 --> 36:17.630]  Now, now let let me say I I will.
[36:17.790 --> 36:20.190]  I will say this is this is more mine and Nick's doing.
[36:20.510 --> 36:21.030]  I apologize.
[36:21.450 --> 36:26.350]  However, you know, I'm looking for the well-being of the F brands
[36:26.350 --> 36:31.030]  when I'm here to manage and everything as as a sort of peace offering to you two.
[36:31.530 --> 36:34.630]  Is there anything that you guys would want to put in the RSS feed
[36:34.630 --> 36:37.650]  as a standalone audio clip in the feed?
[36:37.650 --> 36:43.150]  Yeah. No. And I'll tell you why the feed is called Face. Right.
[36:43.350 --> 36:47.230]  And when we talk about all these other podcasts, like John Rising, his podcast,
[36:47.350 --> 36:48.650]  Geoff's podcast. Brilliant.
[36:48.790 --> 36:49.930]  Obviously, you do want to promote him.
[36:50.010 --> 36:52.750]  We can even, you know, talk about him in the in the episodes if we want.
[36:53.210 --> 36:55.450]  But putting him in the feed is a bit weird.
[36:55.910 --> 36:57.270]  That's not face.
[36:58.390 --> 36:59.190]  I'm sorry.
[36:59.970 --> 37:01.050]  That's a good point.
[37:02.250 --> 37:05.530]  Sorry. I put something in the feed.
[37:05.530 --> 37:08.470]  That is it's going to alert on everyone's phone
[37:08.470 --> 37:10.770]  and it isn't the thing they subscribe to.
[37:11.470 --> 37:15.030]  Now, in their defense, YouTube did this and it went very well.
[37:16.010 --> 37:18.370]  YouTube just threw an album out on people's devices.
[37:18.690 --> 37:19.790]  Nobody was mad about that.
[37:19.930 --> 37:21.950]  Everybody, everybody who had iTunes was a big fan.
[37:21.990 --> 37:23.370]  They woke up to a free YouTube album.
[37:23.450 --> 37:24.510]  They were happy as could be.
[37:24.530 --> 37:26.450]  It took me about eight years to shake that thing.
[37:26.550 --> 37:27.130]  I kept re-syncing.
[37:27.610 --> 37:30.110]  We're kind of like the YouTube or the YouTube of podcasts.
[37:30.390 --> 37:31.530]  We are the YouTube of podcasts.
[37:31.710 --> 37:33.190]  Well, no, you. It would be you.
[37:33.190 --> 37:34.850]  This is a you, you and Eric.
[37:35.010 --> 37:35.510]  You too.
[37:35.910 --> 37:37.370]  No, but there's no way.
[37:37.530 --> 37:39.370]  There's no way Larry Mullen Jr.
[37:40.250 --> 37:42.570]  was into it when they did it. Yeah.
[37:43.050 --> 37:45.010]  So like that's like I get it.
[37:45.890 --> 37:46.230]  I get it.
[37:46.270 --> 37:49.690]  Gavin, in their defense, when in the story that Geoff just told,
[37:50.170 --> 37:53.030]  they brought up that it might do good for numbers, which is not I don't you know,
[37:53.110 --> 37:54.930]  maybe that wasn't a consideration when he voted.
[37:55.310 --> 37:57.130]  Yeah. I mean, on a thought of that.
[37:57.450 --> 37:58.910]  Yeah, but no, not our numbers.
[37:58.910 --> 38:03.450]  I just thought what's more face than bringing it up to a vote,
[38:03.610 --> 38:07.710]  voting against our best interests and then and then me going back
[38:07.710 --> 38:09.350]  and then doing it anyway?
[38:09.530 --> 38:11.910]  That's a stretch. That's a little bit.
[38:12.190 --> 38:14.510]  That's a pretty that's a pretty fucky face, huh?
[38:15.510 --> 38:16.910]  No, that's not really.
[38:17.190 --> 38:19.590]  The thing is, is that I've always trusted the vote.
[38:19.830 --> 38:20.950]  I've always felt like the vote.
[38:20.950 --> 38:21.710]  You got to trust the vote.
[38:21.830 --> 38:22.490]  You got to trust the vote.
[38:23.230 --> 38:24.790]  Hey, Gav, how about this?
[38:24.890 --> 38:25.370]  How about this?
[38:25.650 --> 38:26.770]  Just in case we're not clear.
[38:26.990 --> 38:27.750]  I'm sorry.
[38:28.270 --> 38:29.150]  No, OK, we're good.
[38:29.170 --> 38:30.170]  Do you forgive me?
[38:30.630 --> 38:32.350]  Gavin, you mean so much to me.
[38:32.430 --> 38:33.310]  You're such a close friend.
[38:33.470 --> 38:35.930]  You've been there for me for the last eight or nine years.
[38:36.230 --> 38:37.470]  You mean the world to me.
[38:37.590 --> 38:39.830]  You're the you're the best friend I have on the planet Earth.
[38:40.110 --> 38:42.790]  The last thing I want to do is upset you.
[38:43.010 --> 38:43.750]  So please forgive me.
[38:44.510 --> 38:46.310]  Can I share something really cool with you guys?
[38:46.410 --> 38:47.070]  Like a legitimate.
[38:47.510 --> 38:48.690]  This just blew my mind.
[38:49.090 --> 38:52.910]  This person, I think, who shared it with me doesn't even.
[38:53.110 --> 38:56.210]  I don't feel they made this connection, but I got a tweet from someone.
[38:56.230 --> 38:57.110]  I'll put it in here.
[38:57.110 --> 39:01.310]  In which they went to the Baseball Hall of Fame
[39:02.090 --> 39:06.930]  and they found a Zimmer at the Tampa Bay Rays.
[39:07.590 --> 39:08.850]  He's a retired number.
[39:08.990 --> 39:11.270]  Don Zimmer, retired by the Tampa Bay Rays.
[39:11.790 --> 39:15.390]  One of the only players to be retired, have his number retired by the race.
[39:16.030 --> 39:17.750]  What year was the franchise founded?
[39:18.350 --> 39:20.830]  Wait, how the fuck is Jackie Robinson?
[39:21.070 --> 39:22.610]  Well, I mean, I guess it's baseball.
[39:23.070 --> 39:24.270]  That makes total sense.
[39:24.550 --> 39:25.810]  98. 98.
[39:26.450 --> 39:28.250]  Yeah. Wow.
[39:28.870 --> 39:32.710]  The Rays were founded in 98 and Don Zimmer had his number retired
[39:32.710 --> 39:34.950]  by a team that was founded in 1998.
[39:35.390 --> 39:36.210]  So that's crazy.
[39:36.810 --> 39:41.070]  Does that mean we're Tampa Bay Rays fans as a cast?
[39:41.270 --> 39:42.390]  No, no, no, no.
[39:42.390 --> 39:43.870]  Because so were the Diamondbacks.
[39:44.550 --> 39:46.610]  Yeah, but they didn't retire Don Zimmer's number.
[39:46.990 --> 39:48.850]  Oh, that's true.
[39:49.430 --> 39:50.670]  Why did they retire his?
[39:50.830 --> 39:51.590]  Because he was the coach.
[39:51.670 --> 39:53.350]  Why did they retire Wade Boggs?
[39:53.790 --> 39:54.370]  I don't know.
[39:54.370 --> 39:55.590]  I don't know anything about baseball.
[39:55.690 --> 39:59.050]  I can't comment on the other ones, but listen, they made the the the bear.
[39:59.150 --> 40:00.850]  The Zimmer bear was for the Rays, right?
[40:01.070 --> 40:02.090]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[40:02.190 --> 40:05.650]  So like, clearly he was an important figure as either a manager, whatever,
[40:05.970 --> 40:07.590]  or coach. Is that the same thing?
[40:07.670 --> 40:08.770]  Manager and coach are the same.
[40:08.850 --> 40:11.050]  Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yes, yeah, yeah, they are.
[40:11.110 --> 40:14.430]  Sorry, I was looking up Wade Boggs stats where he played two years
[40:14.430 --> 40:19.270]  for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, 1998 and 1999, and then retired.
[40:19.790 --> 40:21.130]  He came, you know, why, though?
[40:21.170 --> 40:23.410]  Because he grew up in the Tampa Bay area.
[40:23.410 --> 40:26.350]  And so he wanted to end his career there and help launch the franchise.
[40:26.570 --> 40:29.770]  So I think it was like a local hero makes good.
[40:29.930 --> 40:30.930]  That's cool. Kind of thing.
[40:31.410 --> 40:32.270]  That's why they retired it.
[40:32.730 --> 40:34.290]  I just thought that blew my mind.
[40:34.350 --> 40:36.170]  Like I saw, I was like, oh, that's awesome.
[40:36.350 --> 40:37.810]  Like Don Zimmer loves him.
[40:37.870 --> 40:41.230]  And then seeing when the Rays franchise was created, it's like, what a coincidence.
[40:42.230 --> 40:42.890]  That's wild.
[40:43.810 --> 40:44.970]  1998, last good year.
[40:46.070 --> 40:47.110]  Last good year.
[40:47.390 --> 40:48.990]  2013, a possible entry into that.
[40:49.670 --> 40:50.590]  Possible, possible entry.
[40:50.690 --> 40:53.310]  Oh, by the way, by the time this comes out, this will be
[40:53.410 --> 40:56.750]  the what, like the week of 13th.
[40:56.950 --> 41:00.230]  We'll have the 98 movies and music will have come out.
[41:01.110 --> 41:03.430]  So we are wrapping up the summer of 98
[41:03.990 --> 41:08.870]  with the movies and music that everyone will be able to hear us debate and listen to.
[41:09.270 --> 41:11.650]  So, yeah, hopefully they're not too frustrating because obviously we can't show
[41:11.650 --> 41:13.810]  any of the films or play any of the music.
[41:14.030 --> 41:17.390]  Right. But I did feel like they were really fun and good recordings.
[41:17.630 --> 41:18.330]  Oh, you enjoyed them?
[41:18.730 --> 41:19.550]  Yeah. I'm so glad.
[41:20.130 --> 41:21.890]  I did. I had a lot of fun making them.
[41:21.890 --> 41:23.190]  I just wasn't, you know, you never know.
[41:23.390 --> 41:28.550]  I'm excited for the like what the next thing is we do after that.
[41:28.630 --> 41:31.110]  I guess we're going to do like the winter movies of the winter of 98, right?
[41:31.250 --> 41:32.990]  Yeah, we could do a winter 98 thing.
[41:33.590 --> 41:36.990]  I'm feeling like like Jess and Erica were saying, I'm kind of feeling 2013.
[41:37.350 --> 41:39.090]  I just want to see if there's anything there.
[41:39.430 --> 41:43.410]  Well, let me let me throw this out because I put I just posted this in the Slack
[41:43.410 --> 41:44.410]  or in the Discord.
[41:44.690 --> 41:47.710]  I went to eat lunch at Home Slice today, which is a pizza restaurant in Austin.
[41:47.710 --> 41:50.730]  And their menu is devoted to 88.
[41:51.130 --> 41:54.010]  Home Slice, fresh for 88 suckers, big time to the max.
[41:54.390 --> 41:55.850]  Most definitely, I'm so sure.
[41:56.470 --> 41:57.830]  So good. Yeah, good.
[41:57.970 --> 41:59.850]  Let me throw 88 into the mix.
[42:00.210 --> 42:03.410]  I like 88. Nice puffy jacket on the lady in the on the.
[42:03.670 --> 42:05.470]  I was there for like seven months of it.
[42:07.490 --> 42:10.790]  88 feels like kind of like a holdover year
[42:11.950 --> 42:16.450]  to me, where it's just sort of like you mash it all in with like the the late
[42:17.710 --> 42:19.490]  kind of like that late 80s.
[42:19.670 --> 42:22.730]  I mean, I guess the only thing that really I remember was
[42:23.810 --> 42:27.350]  that Kirk Gibson at bat was that was 88.
[42:27.810 --> 42:30.210]  Yeah. So, I mean, you're the one who brought it up.
[42:30.270 --> 42:32.070]  I'm just saying so. Yeah, I know.
[42:32.330 --> 42:34.890]  I just I'm finding it interesting that other establishments,
[42:34.970 --> 42:36.750]  you know, we talked about that Creed tour or whatever.
[42:36.990 --> 42:41.110]  And now I'm starting to see other people embracing previous years,
[42:41.990 --> 42:43.350]  other establishments and businesses.
[42:43.830 --> 42:45.370]  And I like it.
[42:45.370 --> 42:47.950]  Was it you, Andrew, that you talk about Mario Party and then we we.
[42:49.250 --> 42:52.930]  Yeah, we should potentially do a summer of Japan 98 because different.
[42:53.830 --> 42:58.510]  I got really excited because I was like, what games came out at 98?
[42:58.630 --> 43:02.690]  And I just Googled video games released in 98 and Mario Party was on the list.
[43:02.810 --> 43:05.230]  And I was like, holy shit, that's perfect. That's awesome.
[43:05.270 --> 43:06.430]  I can't believe that came out 98.
[43:06.810 --> 43:09.710]  And so I talked to Eric about it and he immediately crushed my dreams
[43:09.710 --> 43:13.210]  and saying it came out in like January of 99.
[43:13.210 --> 43:19.970]  And so I guess it was summer of 98 in Japan or just it was like December 98 in Japan.
[43:20.050 --> 43:23.890]  I love the idea of the next season being the Japanese summer.
[43:24.810 --> 43:25.990]  You know what, though?
[43:26.670 --> 43:28.890]  That's maybe the best thing we could do
[43:28.890 --> 43:32.630]  because that's a way for us to truly experience a 98
[43:32.630 --> 43:34.130]  that we didn't have access to.
[43:34.570 --> 43:38.290]  Yeah, that might really open up our eyes because it's not only it's like,
[43:38.430 --> 43:42.550]  what was the other side of the world doing while we were watching Snake Eyes?
[43:43.210 --> 43:45.190]  What year did Hong Kong get given back?
[43:45.190 --> 43:46.710]  Don't bring Snake Eyes into this.
[43:47.030 --> 43:48.070]  You didn't even...
[43:48.990 --> 43:51.630]  I'd like to think that they were also watching Snake Eyes.
[43:52.630 --> 43:54.750]  Hey, Eric, just in your honor,
[43:54.950 --> 43:58.870]  I put Snake Eyes in the thumbnail for the new summer of 98 movie.
[43:59.170 --> 44:01.330]  I saw. It's a really good thumbnail.
[44:01.590 --> 44:03.390]  Thank you very much. Yeah, man, that was great.
[44:04.770 --> 44:06.210]  Don't... it's not even on the...
[44:06.770 --> 44:10.190]  I found a thing. Another thing, by the way, you know how I'm not a talk to me guy?
[44:10.930 --> 44:11.850]  Mm hmm. Yeah.
[44:11.850 --> 44:13.910]  I'm also not a guy that says stateside.
[44:15.410 --> 44:16.210]  Oh, yeah.
[44:16.310 --> 44:19.270]  Never felt the need to to use that one.
[44:19.390 --> 44:20.190]  In what context?
[44:20.550 --> 44:21.470]  I'll see you stateside.
[44:21.970 --> 44:24.450]  Oh, is that not a thing that said here?
[44:25.250 --> 44:28.770]  No, no, no, we are stateside, so we don't have to say it.
[44:28.850 --> 44:29.930]  I guess you don't. Yeah.
[44:30.030 --> 44:32.830]  I might start saying kingdom side when I'm going.
[44:35.230 --> 44:36.770]  Well, here's you never.
[44:37.310 --> 44:39.070]  You're not separated. Have you ever tried?
[44:39.070 --> 44:43.550]  I guess maybe Dan, if you and Dan are on different like areas of an airplane
[44:43.550 --> 44:46.670]  and going from from Europe to the US
[44:47.370 --> 44:50.690]  or I guess any other location to the US, you stateside would work.
[44:50.950 --> 44:54.210]  What how many scenarios do you are you able to use that?
[44:55.170 --> 44:58.470]  Well, that one specific moment in the air when one of you is
[44:58.470 --> 45:00.950]  if you're in the one person's in the front of the plane and one person's in the back,
[45:00.990 --> 45:03.830]  one person could be inside and the other person could be kingdom side.
[45:03.910 --> 45:05.470]  Right. I'd be about it. That's true.
[45:06.030 --> 45:08.230]  There's a transitional point there where it's pretty immediate.
[45:09.310 --> 45:12.250]  It's like see you next year on New Year's.
[45:12.290 --> 45:14.630]  Like that joke. It's the same type of idea.
[45:16.370 --> 45:18.470]  I was saying this is an idea I had, Geoff.
[45:18.510 --> 45:20.450]  I was thinking about time zone lines.
[45:21.090 --> 45:25.450]  What is like the largest is there is is there a borderline
[45:25.450 --> 45:28.970]  that has a multiple hour time zone difference?
[45:29.490 --> 45:31.710]  Is it possible to stand in the middle?
[45:31.810 --> 45:34.790]  Have half your body be in one time zone, the other half?
[45:34.870 --> 45:36.410]  Like, obviously, you can do that.
[45:36.450 --> 45:38.130]  But is there like a multiple hour?
[45:38.130 --> 45:41.870]  Could you throw a ball in one hand and then technically catch it
[45:41.870 --> 45:44.390]  like two or three hours later in the other hand?
[45:45.130 --> 45:47.490]  Oh, maybe we should do like an hour long home run or something.
[45:49.910 --> 45:52.750]  Well, Geoff, with Dingers, you could you get some range on that.
[45:52.970 --> 45:56.330]  Or you order a pizza where it's where it's free after a certain amount of time has passed.
[45:56.450 --> 45:59.390]  But as the guy's giving it to you, you just back into the other times.
[45:59.750 --> 46:03.370]  Gavin, that's the best life hack you've ever brought up on this show.
[46:03.670 --> 46:05.330]  I like that a lot. I'm writing that down.
[46:07.230 --> 46:07.950]  Hold on a second.
[46:07.950 --> 46:08.910]  I might have an answer for you.
[46:09.090 --> 46:14.110]  I'm looking to see if anything looks close enough where they all kind of like cross.
[46:14.170 --> 46:16.210]  But I don't. It's tough.
[46:17.310 --> 46:20.150]  It doesn't look like anything's like, well, maybe in like that
[46:20.150 --> 46:23.530]  that French Polynesia area looks like you.
[46:23.670 --> 46:26.030]  But that's pretty, you know, we're looking at it on a map.
[46:26.090 --> 46:27.990]  It's not really. It's pretty tough.
[46:28.450 --> 46:30.310]  What's that shit happening under Spain there?
[46:30.430 --> 46:32.330]  Is the bottom of Spain in a different?
[46:34.110 --> 46:35.590]  Time zone? I don't know.
[46:36.130 --> 46:39.710]  So that means it's it's like straight south of England,
[46:39.870 --> 46:41.390]  but there's two hours of time difference.
[46:41.670 --> 46:43.870]  That's insane. I've never seen that.
[46:44.330 --> 46:45.770]  Yeah, I don't I'm not really sure.
[46:46.630 --> 46:48.150]  Time zones are confusing to begin with.
[46:48.250 --> 46:51.350]  I mean, not very confusing, but just confusing enough in the way
[46:51.350 --> 46:52.650]  that like they're all cut up.
[46:53.250 --> 46:55.790]  I OK, when I look at this map, I come to the conclusion
[46:55.790 --> 46:58.250]  that we all as a society are just playing make believe.
[46:58.610 --> 47:02.310]  Here's pretending that you're just you're just figuring that out.
[47:02.430 --> 47:04.750]  I'm just figuring that this is this is madness.
[47:04.750 --> 47:05.670]  This is ridiculous.
[47:06.290 --> 47:07.450]  Here's the closest.
[47:07.850 --> 47:09.250]  Here's the closest I can do for you.
[47:09.450 --> 47:12.190]  So there's a there's a place called Baker Island,
[47:12.370 --> 47:16.370]  and then very close to it is another island called the Line Islands
[47:16.370 --> 47:17.950]  or a group of islands called the Line Islands.
[47:18.190 --> 47:19.550]  And there is 20.
[47:19.750 --> 47:21.750]  They are 26 hours apart in time zone.
[47:21.990 --> 47:24.810]  So if you like you could,
[47:25.630 --> 47:29.590]  I don't know, start juggling on a boat in in the Baker Islands
[47:29.590 --> 47:33.510]  and then go to the Line Islands and then finish juggling 26 hours later,
[47:33.510 --> 47:34.990]  but only take that.
[47:35.070 --> 47:36.450]  But it's only the the boat ride.
[47:36.970 --> 47:40.090]  I was trying to explain that concept, I think, on a podcast once where I said,
[47:40.130 --> 47:42.490]  because there's 26 time zones.
[47:42.690 --> 47:45.130]  Yeah. And there's 24 hours in a day
[47:45.130 --> 47:49.530]  that a calendar day lasts on the earth for 50 hours.
[47:49.930 --> 47:52.690]  But I don't think anyone agreed with me.
[47:53.990 --> 47:55.430]  I agree with you.
[47:55.470 --> 47:58.010]  OK, I yeah, I would never fight that.
[47:59.110 --> 48:01.950]  Right. But I also wouldn't get on board with it.
[48:01.950 --> 48:04.030]  Why not? You could have a 50 hour day.
[48:04.270 --> 48:05.130]  You just got to keep moving.
[48:05.530 --> 48:06.890]  Yeah, I don't think I don't want to keep moving.
[48:07.010 --> 48:09.670]  I did that flying back from Japan where you like chase the sun
[48:09.670 --> 48:11.770]  and you just go like, oh, this I feel insane.
[48:11.930 --> 48:17.190]  Like where it's just daytime for like so long, like so long.
[48:17.470 --> 48:20.030]  And it like makes you feel sick physically.
[48:20.410 --> 48:20.970]  I don't like it.
[48:21.350 --> 48:23.930]  Yeah. You land before you took off and then you have the whole day again.
[48:24.210 --> 48:26.170]  Yeah, it's not it's like not a good feeling.
[48:26.290 --> 48:27.310]  Oh, you make up that time.
[48:27.390 --> 48:28.510]  It's like you certainly don't.
[48:31.030 --> 48:34.410]  I did that once and I went to I flew back to Japan and went straight to VidCon.
[48:34.790 --> 48:36.350]  Like I was up all night.
[48:36.650 --> 48:38.570]  Well, I was up all day in Japan and up all night on the plane.
[48:38.730 --> 48:40.710]  And then I landed that same day, was up all day.
[48:40.790 --> 48:43.610]  And then I was just at some like open bar event at VidCon.
[48:43.750 --> 48:44.850]  And it's like, how is it?
[48:45.010 --> 48:47.950]  It's been Saturday for like 47 hours.
[48:51.670 --> 48:56.570]  Is there anything that is better globally in the summer?
[48:56.570 --> 48:57.750]  Like something you can...
[48:57.750 --> 49:00.130]  Well, summer isn't global.
[49:03.210 --> 49:06.410]  But if you were in like a...
[49:07.150 --> 49:10.510]  I'm thinking about what was that surf documentary?
[49:11.270 --> 49:14.430]  Geoff, you fucking you know, the surf, where they chased the summer.
[49:14.650 --> 49:16.370]  Endless Summer? Endless Summer.
[49:16.710 --> 49:17.970]  Yeah, that should have been easy to remember.
[49:18.830 --> 49:19.870]  It's very...
[49:19.870 --> 49:22.310]  I mean, they weren't being literal with it.
[49:22.370 --> 49:24.370]  They were just traveling around the world surfing.
[49:24.950 --> 49:29.230]  Yeah, but like I feel like they're chasing like the hottest time of year in that region.
[49:29.430 --> 49:29.710]  Were they not?
[49:30.050 --> 49:31.630]  I think they were chasing locations more than anything.
[49:31.750 --> 49:31.970]  But sure.
[49:32.410 --> 49:33.510]  But you know what? Yes.
[49:33.650 --> 49:34.170]  We'll say yes.
[49:34.430 --> 49:36.390]  It sounds like I didn't take anything away from this documentary.
[49:36.670 --> 49:37.650]  Certainly you didn't.
[49:38.570 --> 49:41.190]  No, they they surfed with a...
[49:41.190 --> 49:44.690]  Anyway, I was going to say like, what would be like a thing you could chase?
[49:44.710 --> 49:48.350]  Like what is a funny like ice cream, like endless ice cream?
[49:48.510 --> 49:50.050]  I feel like ice cream is better in the heat.
[49:50.550 --> 49:53.750]  Just keep following the hottest time of year around places like that.
[49:53.750 --> 49:54.330]  Pathway.
[49:55.370 --> 49:55.950]  Swimming's good.
[49:55.990 --> 49:57.210]  I like swimming in the cold, too.
[49:57.770 --> 49:58.870]  I think swimming is just fun.
[49:59.350 --> 50:02.450]  No, you like swimming in the cold.
[50:02.830 --> 50:03.410]  Well, it's not.
[50:03.530 --> 50:06.070]  I'm not going to opt for it, but it's like something I'm not opposed to.
[50:06.070 --> 50:07.830]  You could die if you're swimming.
[50:08.150 --> 50:11.430]  If you're swimming in the cold, it's because the plane crashed
[50:11.430 --> 50:15.210]  or the boat sank and you're trying to tread water until you get rescued.
[50:15.590 --> 50:17.310]  I'm not hopping out in the middle of winter.
[50:17.390 --> 50:20.250]  I'm just saying when it's, you know, it's like not super cold out.
[50:20.330 --> 50:21.230]  There's nothing wrong with a little.
[50:21.450 --> 50:22.990]  I think I think this is a regional thing.
[50:22.990 --> 50:26.450]  I think that your idea of cold and my Texas idea of cold are probably very different.
[50:27.130 --> 50:28.310]  That would. Yeah, absolutely.
[50:28.750 --> 50:29.370]  100% true.
[50:29.850 --> 50:33.850]  Hey, speaking of cold and water and stuff, I had a I had a thought
[50:33.850 --> 50:35.270]  the other day I wanted to ask you guys about.
[50:35.770 --> 50:39.410]  Would you guys take a boat around the earth?
[50:39.490 --> 50:41.990]  Like, would you circumnavigate the planet in a boat?
[50:43.870 --> 50:45.330]  Yeah. How long does it take to do that?
[50:45.710 --> 50:46.850]  I don't know. Doesn't matter.
[50:47.690 --> 50:49.030]  OK, well, time's not an issue.
[50:49.570 --> 50:54.230]  The government has agreed to give you two years to to make the journey
[50:54.230 --> 50:56.230]  and they're going to pay for it and all expenses are paid
[50:56.230 --> 50:58.390]  and they're they're paying your mortgage and your rent and everything.
[50:58.530 --> 50:59.190]  You just have to do it.
[50:59.250 --> 51:00.950]  And it should. I have no idea how long it takes.
[51:01.050 --> 51:03.790]  But I still lose two years of my life.
[51:04.650 --> 51:07.210]  Having an adventure and seeing the entire world.
[51:07.390 --> 51:08.730]  I wouldn't say that's losing anything.
[51:08.770 --> 51:11.270]  I'd say gained a hell of a lot of experience and perspective.
[51:11.510 --> 51:13.250]  And I don't want to do anything for two years.
[51:13.410 --> 51:15.850]  So the answer is no. Two straight years.
[51:16.510 --> 51:18.290]  I don't know that it takes two years.
[51:18.290 --> 51:19.930]  God damn it. How long?
[51:20.130 --> 51:21.910]  OK, I got it. I got it.
[51:22.030 --> 51:22.610]  Two year cutoff.
[51:22.930 --> 51:25.090]  Sailing around the world takes three to five years.
[51:25.270 --> 51:26.570]  It can be done incredibly fast.
[51:26.710 --> 51:28.910]  The world the world record is 40 days.
[51:29.770 --> 51:32.770]  On average, most people when sailing around the world
[51:33.170 --> 51:34.690]  need about three and a half years.
[51:34.890 --> 51:35.850]  So would you do it for three?
[51:35.890 --> 51:38.470]  So I know you don't want to do it for two, but would you do it for three and a half?
[51:39.210 --> 51:40.890]  It really depends on the boat for me.
[51:40.950 --> 51:42.330]  Would you do it in 40 days?
[51:42.870 --> 51:43.510]  40? No.
[51:44.770 --> 51:48.410]  So it sounds like the answer to this question is no from Gavin.
[51:49.730 --> 51:52.490]  Well, it seems it sounds really boring.
[51:54.250 --> 51:56.450]  Do we get Wi-Fi in the boat?
[51:56.690 --> 51:58.150]  There's no Wi-Fi in the sea.
[51:58.710 --> 52:02.010]  That you guys, you said it was boring and it made Geoff mad.
[52:02.850 --> 52:05.530]  No, I didn't mean it was like a cruise ship, Gavin.
[52:05.850 --> 52:06.750]  It's a cruise ship.
[52:06.910 --> 52:08.450]  And you feel like satellite internet.
[52:08.830 --> 52:10.790]  Yeah, you got Starlink or whatever.
[52:10.910 --> 52:11.550]  You've got it all.
[52:11.550 --> 52:15.010]  You would be bored on a cruise ship for Circle in the Globe?
[52:15.130 --> 52:18.410]  I feel like I'm I'm the opposite of a water adjacent guy.
[52:18.770 --> 52:21.150]  Like I want to be in the stuff or nowhere near it.
[52:21.390 --> 52:23.110]  I don't want to be on a boat for 40 days.
[52:23.530 --> 52:24.210]  Sounds miserable.
[52:24.590 --> 52:27.990]  What if they drag you from behind on a little inner tube?
[52:29.050 --> 52:30.270]  Yeah, a couple hours a day.
[52:30.450 --> 52:32.970]  Just not for 40 whole days, just a couple hours a day.
[52:33.030 --> 52:35.150]  Just you get the while you get your you get your fill in the water.
[52:35.290 --> 52:39.290]  The longest someone has been in a tube towed by a boat.
[52:39.290 --> 52:42.650]  Like the longest they throw in sandwiches to you and stuff.
[52:42.890 --> 52:47.150]  I wonder what the deepest ocean anybody's ever been towed in a speedboat like that is.
[52:47.670 --> 52:48.090]  Like what?
[52:48.950 --> 52:52.750]  Like, has anybody ever gone like skiing in the middle of the Atlantic,
[52:53.050 --> 52:54.610]  a thousand miles away from any land?
[52:57.190 --> 52:59.790]  I asked the question because I was thinking about it the other day.
[52:59.850 --> 53:00.850]  It was on like TV or something.
[53:00.850 --> 53:03.210]  And I thought, yeah, I would definitely sail around the world.
[53:03.350 --> 53:05.830]  And then I thought I think Andrew asked the question briefly.
[53:05.950 --> 53:06.530]  We glossed over it.
[53:07.130 --> 53:08.870]  That got to thinking in a big boat.
[53:08.870 --> 53:12.010]  And I was trying to figure out how small I would go before I was like,
[53:12.070 --> 53:12.990]  this is not worth it.
[53:13.230 --> 53:13.750]  You know what I mean?
[53:14.130 --> 53:16.770]  Like it feels like if you're on a cruise ship, that seems pretty safe.
[53:16.890 --> 53:19.510]  But if you're on the cruise ship and on a cruise ship in the middle of nowhere
[53:19.510 --> 53:22.990]  and it starts to sink, you're just as fucked if you're in a sailboat
[53:22.990 --> 53:23.950]  and it starts to sink.
[53:24.270 --> 53:25.970]  You're a really long way away from land.
[53:26.150 --> 53:28.510]  And then I started to think about the go go now day
[53:28.510 --> 53:33.110]  and how uncomfortable I felt when we were in deep ocean
[53:33.110 --> 53:36.350]  and how far how we were an hour and a half away from land
[53:36.350 --> 53:38.690]  and how shitty that made me feel in my tummy.
[53:38.870 --> 53:41.310]  And that got me thinking, maybe I wouldn't do it.
[53:41.550 --> 53:44.030]  And I was wondering if y'all would, because I it's one of those things
[53:44.030 --> 53:46.250]  that I thought instantly, of course, I would do that.
[53:46.630 --> 53:49.410]  And then and then I thought, oh, shit, I may be lying to myself.
[53:49.410 --> 53:50.670]  I might be terrified of that.
[53:51.230 --> 53:53.630]  Yeah, I feel the same way when we when I had to
[53:54.270 --> 53:55.990]  I was swimming with sharks in the Bahamas.
[53:56.090 --> 53:59.170]  We had to boat out to a bigger boat that was just out in the ocean.
[53:59.570 --> 54:02.910]  And it was shocking to see how quickly all the phone signals gone.
[54:03.050 --> 54:05.090]  You can still see the land and you've got no bars.
[54:05.410 --> 54:07.770]  And then we were just going in a boat for about half an hour
[54:07.770 --> 54:09.030]  into the middle of the sea.
[54:09.650 --> 54:12.050]  And the guy driving was like, I never met him before.
[54:12.250 --> 54:15.170]  He could just he could just club me in the head and throw me out.
[54:15.730 --> 54:17.310]  Yeah. How would anyone ever know I was there?
[54:17.890 --> 54:21.090]  There's something really funny about the fact that you're leaving to swim
[54:21.090 --> 54:24.690]  with sharks in your moment of terror is when the cell phone signal drops.
[54:24.910 --> 54:26.870]  That's scarier to me, because
[54:28.270 --> 54:30.030]  because if I got stuck there, I'd be screwed.
[54:30.450 --> 54:32.390]  I swam with the damn sharks. It was fine.
[54:33.150 --> 54:34.590]  At least on the bright side of you.
[54:34.650 --> 54:37.410]  And if you and a shark get into it, it can't call for backup either.
[54:39.590 --> 54:42.590]  I just love the idea that Gavin loses cell phone reception.
[54:42.770 --> 54:45.690]  He's going to swim with sharks and he's looking at the boat cap to be like,
[54:45.770 --> 54:47.350]  I don't know if I can trust this guy.
[54:47.530 --> 54:49.130]  You're about to go swim with sharks.
[54:49.410 --> 54:52.770]  OK, would you get into a boat with someone you've known for three minutes
[54:52.770 --> 54:56.170]  and have him drive you out into the sea for like 45 minutes?
[54:56.690 --> 55:01.750]  Apparently, I would do it with a dude who we don't speak the same language
[55:01.750 --> 55:04.950]  and the engines on fire the whole time and smelling like gasoline.
[55:04.950 --> 55:10.270]  Sure. Yeah, I carpooled with a guy I met on a flight from San Antonio to Austin.
[55:10.670 --> 55:14.250]  Yeah, but you were in a car on the roads with other people.
[55:14.250 --> 55:17.270]  No, but I didn't. My phone didn't work that entire time.
[55:17.490 --> 55:18.950]  I didn't I didn't have roaming.
[55:19.210 --> 55:22.330]  Somebody could somebody could knock you on the head in a car
[55:22.330 --> 55:23.670]  just as easily as on a boat.
[55:24.610 --> 55:26.010]  I don't know. Maybe even easier.
[55:26.290 --> 55:29.090]  There's a lot of empty, a lot of empty land between Austin and San Antonio.
[55:29.090 --> 55:30.030]  You can do it at any moment.
[55:30.170 --> 55:33.170]  But the thing is, in a car, on a public road, he's got to consider
[55:33.170 --> 55:34.110]  where he's going to dump me.
[55:34.830 --> 55:36.570]  Oh, in the middle of the sea, you just.
[55:37.290 --> 55:39.350]  Yeah. Inflate my lungs and shut me down. I'm done.
[55:39.770 --> 55:40.110]  It's true.
[55:40.130 --> 55:43.410]  So you're saying that there's more dumpage in the sea than easy.
[55:43.550 --> 55:44.730]  Oh, it's not more dumpage.
[55:44.750 --> 55:49.770]  It's just the idea of it is more alluring because there's it's such easy dumpage.
[55:50.350 --> 55:53.430]  Because I think people dump way more in cars than they do in boats.
[55:54.330 --> 55:58.970]  Have you guys ever looked into how many people die and disappear in national parks?
[55:59.970 --> 56:01.150]  No, no. Yeah.
[56:01.250 --> 56:03.350]  There's no law enforcement in national parks.
[56:03.350 --> 56:07.450]  And so lots of sketchy shit happens out in national parks
[56:07.450 --> 56:11.310]  that just goes unreported or if it's reported, goes unsolved.
[56:11.990 --> 56:14.230]  National parks are real fucking dangerous because of that.
[56:14.530 --> 56:15.870]  But the law still applies there, though.
[56:17.450 --> 56:18.530]  Yeah, I don't know.
[56:19.710 --> 56:20.950]  Just like I'm just saying.
[56:22.150 --> 56:23.730]  You said that in such a great way.
[56:23.850 --> 56:27.930]  It's the ocean of the it's the ocean of the land, the national park.
[56:29.790 --> 56:32.510]  Walking up to a park and just seeing a sign that say
[56:32.510 --> 56:35.070]  the law stops here, you enter.
[56:36.730 --> 56:39.890]  Jurassic Park, maybe that's probably a place where laws don't apply.
[56:40.650 --> 56:42.470]  All sorts of shit happened in there.
[56:42.750 --> 56:47.090]  Is what is the I mean, if you said if you call someone in National Park
[56:47.090 --> 56:49.670]  with an emergency, the police would try and find you, right?
[56:49.730 --> 56:50.310]  People would come.
[56:50.690 --> 56:53.430]  Like, is there a place where if you tell them where you are,
[56:53.770 --> 56:55.310]  they just shrug and go, we can't help you?
[56:55.890 --> 56:59.250]  Yeah. Any any anybody who doesn't leave when a hurricane
[56:59.250 --> 57:02.110]  is about to destroy their city and it's been evacuated
[57:02.110 --> 57:05.350]  and they get and the governor or mayor will get on the news and say,
[57:05.670 --> 57:08.290]  if you don't evacuate, we can't help you.
[57:08.450 --> 57:10.490]  First responders won't be able to get to you.
[57:10.670 --> 57:13.510]  Yet thousands of people along the Gulf Coast do that every year.
[57:14.170 --> 57:15.890]  My brain went to Hallam ears.
[57:16.410 --> 57:18.410]  That's a tough place to find someone.
[57:18.550 --> 57:19.330]  So there you go.
[57:20.630 --> 57:22.410]  That's going to cause a lot of property damage.
[57:24.170 --> 57:28.030]  Oh, I've never been in a Hallam ears, but I've seen them in movies quite a bit.
[57:28.030 --> 57:29.350]  And it seems very confusing.
[57:29.350 --> 57:33.010]  What if we all pop on a pantomime mask and all go into a hole there?
[57:33.370 --> 57:37.710]  Well, what would you be more afraid if we did that in a hall of mirrors
[57:37.710 --> 57:39.050]  or a national park, Andrew?
[57:40.810 --> 57:42.550]  A Hallam ears, for sure.
[57:42.750 --> 57:43.890]  I said National Park.
[57:43.910 --> 57:45.310]  I think I meant National Forest.
[57:45.750 --> 57:47.430]  Oh, is what I actually mean.
[57:47.430 --> 57:47.970]  Well, I apologize.
[57:48.210 --> 57:50.430]  I'll get I'll clarify whatever it is.
[57:50.490 --> 57:53.730]  When the next episode of So All Right comes out in our feed, I'll listen to it then.
[57:56.390 --> 57:57.270]  Figure it out.
[57:58.410 --> 58:01.730]  Yeah, for it's for example, National Parks usually forbid hunting.
[58:01.890 --> 58:03.350]  National Forests allow it.
[58:03.430 --> 58:05.810]  It's like all all bets are off in National Forests.
[58:05.830 --> 58:08.170]  Can I can I put something in the So All Right feed?
[58:10.090 --> 58:10.970]  Yeah. What do you want?
[58:11.070 --> 58:12.910]  You know what? Yeah, absolutely.
[58:13.050 --> 58:14.310]  I would absolutely love it.
[58:14.870 --> 58:15.870]  Anything you want.
[58:16.310 --> 58:20.290]  Can I just can I just give you the audio file?
[58:20.370 --> 58:21.270]  Do you have to put it in the feed?
[58:24.590 --> 58:26.290]  Yes. OK, OK.
[58:26.370 --> 58:27.050]  I mean, yeah, sure.
[58:27.050 --> 58:29.090]  Whatever. Yeah, why not?
[58:29.370 --> 58:33.050]  Hey, I know we need to wrap up because we're getting about long.
[58:34.010 --> 58:37.090]  However, I would like to leave you guys with a thought.
[58:37.210 --> 58:39.190]  Something to something to maybe work on.
[58:39.450 --> 58:41.430]  OK, from homework between now and next week.
[58:41.450 --> 58:44.170]  And then maybe maybe the audience can have interest in this as well.
[58:44.610 --> 58:47.810]  I had this idea the day when I was I was thinking about what to cook for dinner.
[58:48.310 --> 58:50.930]  And I was I was at the grocery store and I was looking at beans
[58:51.630 --> 58:53.790]  and I saw kidney beans and I thought,
[58:54.350 --> 58:59.330]  I wonder if you could build a human out of food named after human body parts.
[58:59.770 --> 59:02.410]  So I started to assemble what I could come up with.
[59:02.530 --> 59:04.030]  I've got kidney beans.
[59:04.190 --> 59:05.710]  I've got artichoke hearts.
[59:05.910 --> 59:07.730]  I've got elbow macaroni.
[59:07.890 --> 59:09.290]  I've got lady fingers.
[59:09.290 --> 59:14.250]  And I discovered there's a brandy infused chocolate truffle called Nipples of Venus.
[59:14.430 --> 59:18.270]  So we've got nipples, fingers, elbows, hearts and kidneys.
[59:18.310 --> 59:20.730]  We just need to come up with the rest of a body.
[59:21.130 --> 59:22.270]  Do you think we could do that?
[59:22.760 --> 59:23.510]  Do you think there's enough?
[59:23.510 --> 59:26.890]  Do you think do you think there's enough food named after body parts
[59:26.890 --> 59:28.110]  that you could fill out a human?
[59:28.210 --> 59:29.810]  But like chicken legs are out.
[59:31.010 --> 59:32.590]  Chicken leg would work. Why not?
[59:33.050 --> 59:34.230]  What about chicken breast then?
[59:34.250 --> 59:35.790]  Because now we're just putting together other things.
[59:36.530 --> 59:40.710]  Maybe you would do like turkey breast chicken leg.
[59:42.270 --> 59:43.850]  So one animal per part.
[59:44.370 --> 59:47.710]  There's that bit on the if you're eating an artichoke and you got the leaves off,
[59:47.770 --> 59:50.770]  there's that bit between the leaves and the heart called the beard.
[59:51.450 --> 59:52.070]  Is that true?
[59:52.430 --> 59:54.530]  Oh, yeah, she might not be called that.
[59:54.590 --> 59:57.850]  It's just what I called it as a kid.
[59:57.970 --> 59:59.670]  I'm going to I'm going to look that up.
[59:59.670 --> 01:00:01.170]  What about the turkey beard?
[01:00:01.690 --> 01:00:06.330]  I go to head cheese and ears of corn.
[01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:09.050]  Oh, ears of corn is awesome.
[01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:11.810]  Of corn. What about what about cocker van?
[01:00:12.310 --> 01:00:13.190]  Head cheese.
[01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:15.730]  What's the word I'm trying to win?
[01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:16.210]  That's.
[01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:21.710]  By the way.
[01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:23.270]  Yes, it's it is.
[01:00:23.350 --> 01:00:27.330]  I think that they're oh, oh, no, no, there's no artichoke beard.
[01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:30.490]  OK, how do you how do you feel about this potato skin?
[01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:31.950]  Potato skin's great. Great.
[01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:35.210]  Now, now, once we actually get this person built,
[01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:39.170]  they got to have something pumping blood orange, blood orange.
[01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:40.650]  Dude, that's so good.
[01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:43.470]  That's what I'm muscle muscle.
[01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:46.270]  That's amazing.
[01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:48.870]  She gets we've we made so much progress already.
[01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:52.170]  We're like we got we're like 40 percent of the way towards a person.
[01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:53.650]  Yeah, I kind of like this.
[01:00:53.830 --> 01:00:56.030]  Should we eventually, once we got all the ingredients,
[01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:58.410]  lay it out as a human?
[01:00:59.090 --> 01:01:01.030]  Yeah, I mean, eat it together.
[01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:02.850]  I think we should. I do.
[01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.830]  What do you mean?
[01:01:04.090 --> 01:01:08.490]  You know how like sometimes sometimes people like trashy people
[01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:11.450]  who think they're being fancy will eat sushi off a naked lady.
[01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:14.810]  Like what have you ever seen?
[01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:18.090]  It's I see them like reality shows all the time.
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:20.090]  What if we what?
[01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:23.870]  Yeah, we just like sit around a big table and we just eat a person in food.
[01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:26.450]  Spotted dick. Spotted dick.
[01:01:27.110 --> 01:01:27.510]  Clam.
[01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:31.850]  Clam. OK, I'll take it.
[01:01:32.010 --> 01:01:32.830]  That works.
[01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:36.970]  It sucks.
[01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:46.410]  Rub roast. Rub roast is great.
[01:01:48.090 --> 01:01:51.730]  Rub roast. See, look, you guys came up with so many that never crossed my mind.
[01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:52.390]  That's amazing. I see.
[01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:55.490]  This is I love it when we when an idea comes together.
[01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.910]  Nuts. Nuts.
[01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:02.710]  Oh, in my head, this is turning out to be another crazy game of operation.
[01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:10.150]  All right. Well, maybe the you think on that, see what else you can come up with.
[01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:13.230]  And I'm sure the audience can can send us their suggestions as well.
[01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:17.250]  Hey, September 29th, 10 p.m.
[01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:19.510]  We are doing Sloppy Joe's bingo.
[01:02:19.930 --> 01:02:23.110]  So 10 p.m. central. Tune in.
[01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:25.010]  Is there a T-bone in the body?
[01:02:26.770 --> 01:02:29.030]  Human T-bone? Human T-bone.
[01:02:29.290 --> 01:02:30.250]  Yeah. Do we have a T-bone?
[01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:32.370]  Human T-bone? Looking it up now.
[01:02:32.530 --> 01:02:33.290]  I think so.
[01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:35.930]  206 bones.
[01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:38.490]  I don't see any of them necessarily being T-boned.
[01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:39.730]  OK, not OK.
[01:02:39.970 --> 01:02:42.750]  Cut down the center vertebral axis of a human.
[01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:46.850]  Split the black bone and then separate out a section of lower back muscle
[01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:49.450]  and that would result in the equivalent of a T-bone.
[01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:52.070]  Oh, I don't know if that counts.
[01:02:52.690 --> 01:02:54.510]  Gross. I don't like that.
[01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:55.150]  This is fun.
[01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:58.290]  I was fun to see you guys again.
[01:02:58.350 --> 01:02:59.310]  I missed you last week.
[01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:00.230]  Real zazzle.
[01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:02.930]  Next time, Andrew, we should read off your list of musics again
[01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:04.030]  because I enjoyed that last time.
[01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:04.970]  OK, we can do that.
[01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:07.690]  Oh, yeah, we can continue the zazzle streak we got going.
[01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:10.970]  These episodes, since it was summer of 98, Emily was saying
[01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:13.510]  we should put it all on a CD and sell it.
[01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:15.150]  What? I like that.
[01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:16.970]  So the CDs were a thing in 98.
[01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:20.030]  Yeah, but you want us to put the music on it?
[01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:23.450]  No, put Andrew's 75 fucking lines on a CD.
[01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:26.670]  Oh, I thought you were telling us to put our playlist on.
[01:03:26.850 --> 01:03:29.230]  No, no, no. We can't sell other people's music.
[01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:30.590]  No, I don't want to do that.
[01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:33.610]  Good. No, this was a bad idea.
[01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:36.550]  So let's sell Andrew saying 75 stupid things.
[01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:40.210]  One comment I really enjoyed from the most recent episode that came out
[01:03:40.210 --> 01:03:42.410]  is that Geoff said we're off, we're off fruit.
[01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:45.310]  We need to turn towards vegetables and be a vegetable podcast.
[01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:48.290]  And then apparently Geoff listed like five fruits.
[01:03:49.330 --> 01:03:50.130]  You know what I listed?
[01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:53.910]  I listed shit like tomatoes and they're like, and they're like,
[01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:56.610]  if it's got a seed, it's technically a fruit.
[01:03:56.770 --> 01:04:00.690]  So I looked up a list of vegetables on Wikipedia and it says some vegetables
[01:04:00.690 --> 01:04:03.950]  which are botanically fruits such as tomatoes are still considered
[01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:06.350]  to be vegetables in the culinary sense.
[01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:07.930]  And so... Fair play?
[01:04:08.050 --> 01:04:09.530]  So fuck y'all. How about that?
[01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:12.050]  Yeah, get them.
[01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:18.510]  You go to a store and you go to buy tomato,
[01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:21.130]  it's going to be in the vegetable aisle, I guarantee you.
[01:04:21.730 --> 01:04:23.230]  Yeah, fair point.
[01:04:24.130 --> 01:04:25.210]  You got them real good.
[01:04:25.550 --> 01:04:29.490]  I know. No, no reason to get pedantic about what is what is what
[01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:31.350]  is commonly referred to as a vegetable.
[01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:34.170]  Right. We would never get pedantic on this show.
[01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:35.670]  Thank you. No, it's not what we do.
[01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:38.650]  Would you like a dog if it had a handle?
[01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:40.690]  What the fuck? End the show.
[01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:43.130]  You mean like a suitcase?
[01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:44.830]  Like you could pick it up like a suitcase?
[01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:48.810]  Well, I've seen a lot of dogs wearing like, you know, wraps around their body
[01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:51.030]  on top is a little handle for like small dogs.
[01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:54.850]  But then I thought, what if the shoulder blades just went really high
[01:04:54.850 --> 01:04:59.570]  and then a bone bridged across and then it's like normal fur and skin?
[01:05:00.110 --> 01:05:03.590]  Do you think if a dog combined with a GameCube, would it be better?
[01:05:03.790 --> 01:05:04.870]  Is that a sensible question?
[01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:08.790]  I was just wondering whether I'd be weirded out by the dog
[01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:12.290]  if it had a natural handle or that would be awesome.
[01:05:12.850 --> 01:05:14.530]  Isn't that the scruff? Oh, yeah.
[01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:17.430]  No, but you can't you can't get your hand all the way under it.
[01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:19.430]  Yeah. Do you think?
[01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:24.070]  Because the way we have dogs now, like like our sweet little Henry,
[01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:27.890]  the way we have dogs, the way we have dogs now, it's it's through
[01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:30.950]  it's through hundreds of years of selective breeding, right?
[01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:34.410]  Like if you look up what an English bulldog looked like 100 years ago,
[01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:36.950]  it's very different from what an English bulldog looks like now
[01:05:37.890 --> 01:05:39.410]  because they've been bred
[01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:42.230]  to to achieve that aesthetic. Right.
[01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:43.870]  And that's the case for almost all dogs.
[01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:47.790]  So do you think if you put your work, if you really put work into it,
[01:05:47.930 --> 01:05:52.010]  do you think you could breed a handle into a dog?
[01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:58.330]  I think you'd be relying on some pretty hefty mutations there.
[01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:03.010]  You'd have to just keep an eye out for a dog with massive shoulder blades
[01:06:03.010 --> 01:06:04.470]  and then breathe and wait for another one.
[01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:07.030]  I'm not saying that you would do it quickly.
[01:06:07.310 --> 01:06:10.050]  You know, it might not even be something you do in your lifetime.
[01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:12.970]  But if you started today, maybe your kids could get there.
[01:06:13.730 --> 01:06:16.750]  And imagine it, imagine it like thick, like a pelvis.
[01:06:17.010 --> 01:06:19.010]  So it's not like a weak bone that has a bunch of joints.
[01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:20.730]  It's just like a solid piece.
[01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.450]  And you can pet the top of the handle if you want.
[01:06:22.850 --> 01:06:23.830]  And you can also use the handle.
[01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:27.790]  It needs to be a strong handle because if it breaks off, you can't glue it back on.
[01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:33.530]  No. You can pet the top of the handle and use it as a handle.
[01:06:35.410 --> 01:06:37.130]  Well, you can pet under the handle, you know.
[01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:40.210]  Like belly scratches for a handle.
[01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:42.870]  That's nice. Can we end this now, please?
[01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:45.270]  I'll be honest. I thought Eric would have more input.
[01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:47.150]  No, I'm a tiny, shitty little dog guy.
[01:06:47.490 --> 01:06:51.630]  I like I like the idea, I think, a little bit.
[01:06:51.690 --> 01:06:54.830]  But also picking up a dog by a handle that is the dog.
[01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:56.870]  I'm not a big... I don't think I really like it.
[01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:59.750]  It's handle, not a hat. It's just it's like it's leg.
[01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:02.930]  Yeah, no, I know. I just don't think that like I think we have that.
[01:07:03.070 --> 01:07:05.710]  And it's the scruff. And we just I don't pick up dogs like that.
[01:07:05.770 --> 01:07:08.570]  You're not into it now because we have it. It doesn't exist yet.
[01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:12.510]  But once it exists and people get used to it, it might become very commonly accepted
[01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:13.810]  and maybe even sought after.
[01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:16.850]  No, no. All right.
[01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:18.610]  I could imagine it in Fallout five.
[01:07:18.850 --> 01:07:20.710]  Yeah, that feels like a good place for it.
[01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:21.770]  Handle dogs in Fallout.
[01:07:22.310 --> 01:07:23.770]  When does Fallout five come out?
[01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:25.690]  I don't think it's even announced.
[01:07:25.690 --> 01:07:27.410]  So probably like 2040 forever.
[01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:30.450]  I guess we have to wait. We're getting Starfield in a couple of days, right?
[01:07:30.930 --> 01:07:32.270]  We'll get tomorrow. Yeah.
[01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:34.090]  Tonight, I think it's not out today.
[01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.890]  I don't know.
[01:07:34.890 --> 01:07:36.710]  But I don't know whether to be excited about that.
[01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:37.470]  Is that going to be good?
[01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:38.450]  Do people think it's good?
[01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:39.890]  I think it's going to be good.
[01:07:40.070 --> 01:07:40.510]  Oh, sweet.
[01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:44.330]  I don't personally think Bethesda makes a lot of bad games.
[01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:46.430]  I think they're always good.
[01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:50.450]  Wasn't Fallout 76 a big jumbo turd?
[01:07:50.590 --> 01:07:52.270]  Did you ever play it? It was fucking fun as hell.
[01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:55.670]  I didn't like it at launch, but people love it now.
[01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:58.550]  Like, yeah, at launch it's fun now.
[01:07:58.650 --> 01:07:59.110]  I enjoy it.
[01:07:59.310 --> 01:08:01.050]  Is it fun with people or fun solo though?
[01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:01.990]  Both. I play solo.
[01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:03.010]  I think both. Yeah.
[01:08:03.110 --> 01:08:04.090]  OK, I'll give it a go.
[01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:07.030]  It's one of those games that seems to have come back around.
[01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:08.990]  Thanks for listening to this podcast.
[01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:10.750]  If you liked it, subscribe.
[01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:12.390]  And then I think that's it.
[01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:16.150]  There won't be any more So Alright on this feed, but you can go to So
[01:08:16.150 --> 01:08:18.550]  Alright's feed and listen to whatever Gavin puts over there.
[01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:19.250]  Yeah.
[01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:22.470]  If suddenly there's something over there, just know Gavin did it.
[01:08:23.130 --> 01:08:26.950]  And listen, feel free to listen to the ones I do, too,
[01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:29.950]  because I'm also putting content out on the So Alright feed. Right.
[01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.870]  It's not just Gavin.
[01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:36.290]  I really enjoyed the first episode, So Alright, I thought it was really good.
[01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:36.890]  Thank you.
[01:08:36.970 --> 01:08:38.990]  You know, I found something interesting.
[01:08:40.570 --> 01:08:43.210]  Three people, I'm not going to say who they were, three people
[01:08:43.210 --> 01:08:47.030]  the day my new podcast launched reached out to me to congratulate me and say,
[01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:48.330]  Hey, that's really cool.
[01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:50.610]  Really loved it. Or congratulations on your launch.
[01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:51.230]  I hope it goes well.
[01:08:51.230 --> 01:08:55.070]  Three people out of everybody on earth that I know did that,
[01:08:55.190 --> 01:08:57.850]  and none of them were in this podcast.
[01:08:58.290 --> 01:08:59.150]  Thanks for listening.
[01:08:59.290 --> 01:09:00.810]  I just, well, no, I just.
[01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:05.590]  Well, I was I was I'm an honorable man.
[01:09:05.690 --> 01:09:08.510]  I didn't listen to it yet, but I didn't listen to it yet.
[01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:11.570]  But, you know, I'll find it in in this feed.
[01:09:12.230 --> 01:09:13.530]  We are Mango Street.
[01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:15.770]  We already quit. We already cut. Oh.
[01:09:17.230 --> 01:09:18.030]  Hey, guys.
[01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:21.250]  Major League fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of Face.
[01:09:21.670 --> 01:09:23.490]  Geoff is the best that ad reads.
[01:09:23.710 --> 01:09:25.010]  Patton is playing Starfield.
[01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:26.370]  Gavin gets cocky.
[01:09:26.650 --> 01:09:27.730]  Let's talk about houses.
[01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:29.390]  Geoff cooked up some faces.
[01:09:29.610 --> 01:09:32.030]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:09:32.330 --> 01:09:34.770]  All that and more on next week's episode of Face.
