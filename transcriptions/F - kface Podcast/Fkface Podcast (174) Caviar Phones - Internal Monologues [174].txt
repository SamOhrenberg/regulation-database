[00:10.050 --> 00:10.990]  How are you doing, Geoff?
[00:11.830 --> 00:13.210]  I am fine. How are you?
[00:13.610 --> 00:14.610]  I am okay.
[00:15.530 --> 00:17.130]  That's cool. We're going to talk about robots today.
[00:17.290 --> 00:17.910]  Yeah, we are.
[00:18.490 --> 00:20.570]  He will be here in less than 30 seconds.
[00:20.850 --> 00:22.470]  Less than 30 seconds.
[00:23.230 --> 00:24.850]  If you have anything to say about him, now is the time.
[00:25.230 --> 00:25.770]  I don't like him.
[00:26.310 --> 00:27.410]  I mean, that's easy.
[00:28.210 --> 00:29.050]  That's not true. I love him.
[00:29.150 --> 00:32.610]  I only like him because he has a pool for you guys to enjoy.
[00:33.070 --> 00:34.670]  Yeah, I hope we get to use that on Saturday.
[00:34.890 --> 00:35.690]  I would love to do that.
[00:36.310 --> 00:39.290]  Last episode, we talked about taking over Let's Play.
[00:39.630 --> 00:40.650]  We talked about Andrew's ankles.
[00:40.870 --> 00:41.910]  We talked about Geoff's new achievement.
[00:42.170 --> 00:44.630]  We talked about Team 17.
[00:45.190 --> 00:46.270]  Andrew's bad rep.
[00:47.130 --> 00:48.950]  Regulation flavors. The flavor draft.
[00:49.630 --> 00:50.050]  Bigfoot.
[00:50.950 --> 00:52.670]  But that was all last time. So this is this time.
[00:53.370 --> 00:54.910]  Hello and welcome to another...
[00:54.910 --> 00:55.930]  God damn it!
[00:56.150 --> 00:58.510]  I'm excited about this time. I'm sorry.
[00:58.510 --> 01:01.030]  I have to explain. Before you got here,
[01:01.250 --> 01:02.990]  the same fucking thing happened
[01:02.990 --> 01:04.690]  with this one and Nick.
[01:04.690 --> 01:07.270]  They were just talking on top of each other.
[01:07.390 --> 01:09.290]  Would stop and then talk on top of each other.
[01:09.850 --> 01:10.190]  Insane.
[01:10.730 --> 01:13.590]  We did the verbal thing of when you try to pass someone
[01:13.590 --> 01:15.530]  in a store and then you both end up
[01:15.530 --> 01:17.090]  trying to adjust the same way.
[01:17.490 --> 01:19.670]  It's just awkward and you just get stuck.
[01:20.050 --> 01:20.870]  That was what we did.
[01:21.450 --> 01:23.870]  We both gave each other a lot of room.
[01:24.110 --> 01:25.050]  Do you feel like it happens
[01:25.050 --> 01:26.510]  more to you than most?
[01:27.230 --> 01:29.270]  I don't know. I'm not polling people.
[01:29.410 --> 01:31.730]  I don't know how often the average person experiences that.
[01:32.670 --> 01:33.670]  I'd say it happens
[01:33.670 --> 01:35.970]  maybe once every...
[01:35.970 --> 01:37.790]  I don't know, maybe a year? Once a year?
[01:38.050 --> 01:38.950]  Once every few years?
[01:39.710 --> 01:41.570]  I'd say it happens four or five times
[01:41.570 --> 01:44.070]  this podcast a week.
[01:44.230 --> 01:45.750]  Hello and welcome to a...
[01:45.750 --> 01:46.750]  God damn it!
[01:48.170 --> 01:49.990]  Everybody shut the fuck up
[01:49.990 --> 01:50.610]  for a second.
[01:50.930 --> 01:53.810]  Hello and welcome to another episode
[01:53.810 --> 01:55.310]  of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:55.910 --> 01:57.790]  My name is Geoff Ramsey or some folks
[01:57.790 --> 01:59.650]  call me T-Bone. With me as always
[02:00.430 --> 02:02.230]  Regulation, Gooch, Scoop
[02:02.230 --> 02:04.330]  and Caviar. This is episode
[02:06.070 --> 02:06.470]  174.
[02:07.430 --> 02:08.310]  Let me go ahead and say
[02:08.310 --> 02:10.250]  this isn't going to be a great intro episode.
[02:11.050 --> 02:12.270]  I think that was a great intro.
[02:12.930 --> 02:14.250]  What I mean to a new audience.
[02:14.870 --> 02:16.390]  What Geoff did where he screamed
[02:16.390 --> 02:18.130]  for everyone to shut up, I had to do
[02:18.130 --> 02:20.250]  but it wasn't for content. I just needed everyone to
[02:20.250 --> 02:22.210]  shut up earlier. So you just do that
[02:22.210 --> 02:24.290]  in normal conversation? You just scream
[02:24.290 --> 02:26.870]  shut up? With you guys?
[02:27.010 --> 02:28.350]  Yes. When I am trying
[02:28.350 --> 02:30.110]  to get a point across or trying to get something
[02:30.110 --> 02:32.030]  answered and it is people talking on top
[02:32.030 --> 02:34.190]  of each other? Absolutely. I'd say that's quite
[02:34.190 --> 02:35.630]  extreme social conduct.
[02:35.950 --> 02:37.870]  Gavin, can I ask you a question?
[02:38.150 --> 02:40.170]  Yeah. Haven't you spent time socially
[02:40.170 --> 02:41.070]  with Eric ever?
[02:42.530 --> 02:44.030]  It happens at lunch, it happens
[02:44.030 --> 02:46.090]  in the morning, it happens around the break show, it happens
[02:46.090 --> 02:48.050]  in the parking lot, it happens at coffee shops
[02:48.050 --> 02:50.030]  like... I just don't want
[02:50.030 --> 02:52.030]  just stop if one person is talking
[02:52.030 --> 02:54.290]  just let them... I just... all talking
[02:54.290 --> 02:56.150]  at the same time and then we can't do
[02:56.150 --> 02:58.150]  an intro and I can't get answers and it's
[02:58.150 --> 03:00.090]  like I'll just jump out a window. Just jump out a window.
[03:00.430 --> 03:02.190]  Insane. Alright, so how do you want this
[03:02.190 --> 03:03.370]  episode to go next, Eric?
[03:04.010 --> 03:06.210]  Well, earlier everyone was talking like robots
[03:06.210 --> 03:08.010]  so we've already done that
[03:08.010 --> 03:09.970]  we don't have to do that now. You weren't here for that
[03:09.970 --> 03:12.070]  but it was almost working pretty well.
[03:12.470 --> 03:14.230]  Um, what I
[03:14.230 --> 03:16.170]  want to... let's see, what do I
[03:16.170 --> 03:17.990]  want... how do I want this to go?
[03:19.150 --> 03:19.510]  Um...
[03:20.450 --> 03:22.210]  Well... That has been like the 10th
[03:22.210 --> 03:24.090]  burp I've heard from Geoff in like 5 minutes.
[03:24.250 --> 03:26.230]  Are you ok? Here's what I want to know. Are you ok
[03:26.230 --> 03:28.430]  man? Dude, I'm just pounding Diet Dr. Pepper
[03:28.430 --> 03:29.670]  today. I'm thirsty.
[03:31.210 --> 03:32.490]  I got hot. I got hot.
[03:32.550 --> 03:34.170]  I was out on the tarmac today, Eric.
[03:34.350 --> 03:36.350]  I got hot. You were out on the
[03:36.350 --> 03:38.170]  tarmac? What does that mean, Geoff?
[03:38.670 --> 03:40.230]  Uh, I was gonna go for a flight
[03:40.230 --> 03:42.350]  with my friend Gus this morning. Oh!
[03:42.750 --> 03:44.070]  But, uh, it didn't happen.
[03:44.310 --> 03:46.270]  What happened? But we did spend about 2
[03:46.270 --> 03:48.010]  hours in the sun. Uh,
[03:48.390 --> 03:50.210]  there was a problem with the radio. Like, we
[03:50.210 --> 03:52.090]  could communicate with the ground but not with
[03:52.090 --> 03:53.910]  uh, the other people.
[03:53.910 --> 03:55.690]  I don't know, control or some shit.
[03:55.950 --> 03:57.530]  And so, we just didn't take off.
[03:57.810 --> 03:59.230]  You sat in the plane there? Yeah!
[03:59.470 --> 04:01.030]  I drove around in the plane for a little while.
[04:01.250 --> 04:03.810]  As a matter of fact, Gus and I both flipped
[04:03.810 --> 04:05.850]  off Elon Musk's jet. It was right next to us
[04:05.850 --> 04:06.630]  on the tarmac. Wow!
[04:08.090 --> 04:09.850]  Did you feel like, uh,
[04:09.910 --> 04:11.570]  a little kid, like, learning to drive?
[04:11.690 --> 04:13.570]  Like, you're not actually experiencing the thing.
[04:13.610 --> 04:15.190]  You're just in, like, the driveway.
[04:15.730 --> 04:17.970]  Going forward and back. Yeah, exactly
[04:17.970 --> 04:19.810]  like that. It's like, you know, there's two
[04:19.810 --> 04:21.990]  there's a, there's a steering wheel on the
[04:21.990 --> 04:23.910]  left and then a steering wheel on the right. You know, Gus
[04:23.910 --> 04:26.010]  let me hold on to that steering wheel. It didn't do anything.
[04:26.130 --> 04:27.230]  But I felt like I was steering.
[04:28.290 --> 04:29.970]  Exactly. Uh, no, it was really fucking
[04:29.970 --> 04:31.930]  cool. Even though we didn't actually fly, just
[04:31.930 --> 04:33.910]  watching Gus go through the process of getting
[04:33.910 --> 04:35.630]  a plane ready and just
[04:36.490 --> 04:38.050]  seeing how, I don't
[04:38.050 --> 04:40.050]  know, good at it he is
[04:40.050 --> 04:41.990]  and how seriously he takes it, it was impressive
[04:41.990 --> 04:43.770]  and kind of funny. Would you say it's the coolest
[04:43.770 --> 04:45.350]  you've ever seen Gus look?
[04:46.970 --> 04:47.410]  No,
[04:48.110 --> 04:48.550]  uh,
[04:49.390 --> 04:51.310]  it's up there, but he didn't look
[04:51.310 --> 04:53.490]  at any point, uh, like he was approaching
[04:53.490 --> 04:55.410]  cool. No. Really? I feel
[04:55.410 --> 04:57.130]  like flight stuff is, like, cool
[04:57.130 --> 04:59.090]  impressive guy stuff. For a lot of people
[04:59.090 --> 05:01.290]  it isn't, like, for Gus. But some
[05:01.290 --> 05:03.250]  people, you know, I include
[05:03.250 --> 05:05.410]  Gus and myself in that, you're just not
[05:05.410 --> 05:07.510]  gonna look cool no matter what. He might be the
[05:07.510 --> 05:08.370]  the coolest
[05:09.230 --> 05:11.210]  nerd dweeb. Like, he's been in
[05:11.210 --> 05:12.250]  situations where
[05:13.170 --> 05:14.230]  like, dealing with, like,
[05:14.270 --> 05:16.270]  convention people, like, loading into, like,
[05:16.290 --> 05:18.250]  getting all the stuff from the unloading bay and stuff
[05:18.250 --> 05:20.290]  he just knows, he just knows what he's doing
[05:20.290 --> 05:22.170]  with procedure. It's very
[05:22.170 --> 05:24.170]  impressive. He is in, he is
[05:24.170 --> 05:26.450]  I'll say this about Gus, uh
[05:27.150 --> 05:28.330]  somebody that we don't ever talk
[05:28.330 --> 05:30.230]  about in this podcast, so I don't know why we're talking about him now
[05:30.230 --> 05:32.110]  but, uh, he is one of the most capable people
[05:32.110 --> 05:34.050]  I've ever met when he puts his mind towards
[05:34.050 --> 05:36.390]  something. I just am trying to understand
[05:36.390 --> 05:38.250]  what, like, is confidence
[05:38.250 --> 05:40.210]  cool? Is that what you're saying is cool, Gavin?
[05:40.210 --> 05:41.750]  Like, what is cool about
[05:41.750 --> 05:44.190]  It's not really confidence, it's just that
[05:44.190 --> 05:46.170]  he knows all the possible outcomes
[05:46.170 --> 05:48.270]  and he knows all of
[05:48.270 --> 05:50.190]  the possible paths he could take based on what
[05:50.190 --> 05:51.910]  other people say. Like, he's just prepared.
[05:52.250 --> 05:54.330]  He memorized, he's memorized
[05:54.330 --> 05:56.110]  the org chart for everything
[05:56.110 --> 05:58.290]  like, all the, like, if then
[05:58.290 --> 06:00.170]  if this person says no
[06:00.170 --> 06:02.050]  go, yeah, he's memorized every
[06:02.050 --> 06:04.050]  possible flow chart related to his career
[06:04.530 --> 06:06.290]  Okay. I was just trying to
[06:06.290 --> 06:08.150]  figure out if it was actually, like,
[06:08.150 --> 06:09.810]  cool in a general sense
[06:09.810 --> 06:12.090]  or, like, Gavin's specific
[06:12.090 --> 06:13.870]  version of what cool would be.
[06:14.090 --> 06:15.990]  Maybe just impressive. Impressive
[06:15.990 --> 06:18.310]  might be a better word. Like, you're, like, Andrew
[06:18.310 --> 06:20.110]  you're impressive. Oh, I
[06:20.110 --> 06:21.590]  would strongly disagree with that.
[06:21.890 --> 06:23.670]  You do... Very impressive.
[06:23.930 --> 06:25.870]  You do weird shit
[06:25.870 --> 06:28.070]  that's impressive. What have you been doing
[06:28.070 --> 06:30.170]  Andrew, in, in Starfield?
[06:30.770 --> 06:31.290]  Oh.
[06:32.330 --> 06:33.470]  We're gonna go immediately
[06:33.930 --> 06:36.090]  We talked a lot about Starfield so I didn't plan on talking
[06:36.090 --> 06:38.350]  too much about it. Let's not talk too much about it
[06:38.350 --> 06:39.930]  but this is fascinating. Let's be brief.
[06:39.930 --> 06:42.110]  I surveyed every single
[06:42.110 --> 06:44.210]  planet fully in Starfield
[06:44.210 --> 06:45.690]  There's, there's a lot of planets
[06:45.690 --> 06:47.990]  There's a lot more than I thought there would be
[06:48.570 --> 06:49.970]  It, uh, has been a grind
[06:49.970 --> 06:52.250]  How many did you think there were and how many
[06:52.250 --> 06:54.110]  did there turn out to be? Uh, I can
[06:54.110 --> 06:56.150]  pull that up quickly. I believe that there
[06:56.150 --> 06:57.870]  would be, like, a little over a thousand
[06:57.870 --> 07:00.170]  cause all the marketing material around the game was, like
[07:00.170 --> 07:02.290]  over a thousand planets so I figured
[07:02.670 --> 07:04.150]  that'd be less than, like
[07:04.150 --> 07:06.250]  a thousand two hundred fifty or something like that
[07:06.250 --> 07:07.750]  like a really nice number. If they say over a thousand
[07:07.750 --> 07:09.750]  you expect it to be like a thousand three
[07:09.750 --> 07:12.090]  Exactly. Yeah, so I
[07:12.090 --> 07:14.130]  ended up scanning, I've scanned
[07:14.130 --> 07:16.250]  one thousand six hundred ninety three planets
[07:16.250 --> 07:17.970]  Jesus! Yeah
[07:17.970 --> 07:20.230]  I remember sending you and Gavin a
[07:20.230 --> 07:22.130]  text at five hundred being like
[07:22.130 --> 07:24.050]  halfway there! And then
[07:24.050 --> 07:26.350]  around eight hundred I realized this is not
[07:26.350 --> 07:27.910]  the math is not adding up
[07:27.910 --> 07:30.070]  for how much I've left. So, I've played
[07:30.070 --> 07:31.490]  the game for about sixty
[07:31.490 --> 07:33.450]  hours or so and I'm at
[07:33.450 --> 07:35.490]  the last mission and I've scanned
[07:36.210 --> 07:37.530]  eighteen planets maybe?
[07:38.370 --> 07:39.590]  How many hours
[07:39.590 --> 07:41.670]  do you think you have in stock? Oh god
[07:41.670 --> 07:43.530]  I, it's impossible cause I just
[07:43.530 --> 07:45.530]  have been letting the game run ever since
[07:45.530 --> 07:46.950]  like I, it's the only thing I've been playing
[07:47.490 --> 07:49.470]  Yeah, I can't like accurately
[07:49.470 --> 07:51.470]  tell but essentially any free
[07:51.470 --> 07:53.390]  time I have I've been putting it into
[07:53.390 --> 07:55.350]  scanning planets up until
[07:55.350 --> 07:57.070]  last night. I've got like
[07:58.150 --> 07:59.590]  seventy something hours
[07:59.590 --> 08:01.530]  or maybe more. I'm level like
[08:01.530 --> 08:03.570]  thirty eight. I've noticed that on the
[08:03.570 --> 08:04.990]  picture of your completed scans
[08:05.570 --> 08:07.510]  you are level ninety five
[08:07.510 --> 08:09.230]  just from scanning
[08:10.710 --> 08:11.610]  I went up
[08:11.610 --> 08:13.650]  yeah I think like I did some side missions
[08:13.650 --> 08:15.630]  and stuff and got to like level seventeen
[08:15.630 --> 08:17.670]  or eighteen and then everything from
[08:17.670 --> 08:18.950]  there to I'm currently
[08:19.450 --> 08:21.390]  like ninety five or ninety six
[08:21.390 --> 08:22.930]  and that was all just surveying
[08:23.590 --> 08:25.670]  planet after planet. Well I could
[08:25.670 --> 08:27.690]  tell how little progress you've made in the game
[08:27.690 --> 08:28.990]  because I was like oh you know
[08:28.990 --> 08:31.850]  Vladmir's gonna be happy with all that data and you said
[08:31.850 --> 08:32.510]  who's that?
[08:33.270 --> 08:34.250]  Yeah, I don't know
[08:35.670 --> 08:37.730]  I think he's in a place called the eye
[08:37.730 --> 08:39.830]  right? Which I haven't been to yet
[08:39.830 --> 08:41.890]  I have parents I still haven't
[08:41.890 --> 08:43.870]  met. I've traveled the entire universe
[08:43.870 --> 08:45.510]  and I haven't met my parents yet
[08:45.510 --> 08:47.830]  Andrew, when you play Starfield
[08:47.830 --> 08:49.830]  you're going to love it. It's such a fun
[08:49.830 --> 08:51.150]  game. I can't wait for you to see
[08:51.690 --> 08:53.830]  I found something fucking crazy
[08:53.830 --> 08:55.690]  there's one, there's only
[08:55.690 --> 08:57.590]  one system I went into that
[08:57.590 --> 08:59.090]  immediately gives you a side quest
[08:59.090 --> 09:01.750]  blew my mind. So I'm excited to fully explore
[09:01.750 --> 09:03.550]  that. I was like oh I'll check this out
[09:03.550 --> 09:05.370]  I was reading on
[09:05.810 --> 09:07.630]  I was reading on Reddit today, I don't know how true
[09:07.630 --> 09:09.630]  this is, but supposedly they paid
[09:09.630 --> 09:11.790]  an homage to the planet Reach
[09:11.790 --> 09:13.550]  from the Halo series. Like it's where
[09:13.550 --> 09:15.570]  it would be in the universe and you can go there
[09:15.570 --> 09:17.570]  and it's a really lush and beautiful
[09:17.570 --> 09:19.690]  planet that looks kind of like Reach looked before it got
[09:19.690 --> 09:21.670]  glassed. I think I
[09:21.670 --> 09:23.610]  I think I remember that but like
[09:23.610 --> 09:25.510]  when I've been through so many planets
[09:25.510 --> 09:27.370]  my brain is like kind of broken
[09:27.370 --> 09:29.430]  in that way. Like it's all, it's like
[09:29.430 --> 09:31.790]  too much data. But the real issue
[09:31.790 --> 09:33.190]  with this planet thing
[09:33.190 --> 09:35.670]  and as Gavin said, I haven't explored far
[09:35.670 --> 09:37.570]  enough in the game to sell any of this stuff. I haven't
[09:37.570 --> 09:39.490]  met anyone that can buy it, I don't think.
[09:39.830 --> 09:41.550]  So I have all this planetary
[09:41.550 --> 09:43.230]  data on my ship.
[09:43.570 --> 09:45.650]  So whenever you fully survey a planet it gives
[09:45.650 --> 09:47.610]  you a physical item that you
[09:47.610 --> 09:49.590]  can then sell. So I have
[09:49.590 --> 09:51.650]  that many physical items in my
[09:51.650 --> 09:53.590]  ship and I tried after
[09:53.590 --> 09:55.650]  I did all this yesterday to pull, cause I've
[09:55.650 --> 09:57.490]  just been throwing it in my ship's cargo.
[09:57.710 --> 09:59.710]  Cause it's weightless. So you can have as much
[09:59.710 --> 10:01.450]  of it as you want, it's not, there's no
[10:01.450 --> 10:03.630]  all of the limitations for cargo is
[10:03.630 --> 10:05.050]  based upon weight and not items.
[10:05.330 --> 10:07.410]  So I have it all there, I tried to pull it all
[10:07.410 --> 10:08.690]  and the game just froze.
[10:09.170 --> 10:11.410]  So I think I'm gonna have to like one by one
[10:11.410 --> 10:13.550]  pull it and then I don't know if the game
[10:13.550 --> 10:15.750]  will just crash if I hold it all at once
[10:15.750 --> 10:17.090]  and try to go anywhere.
[10:17.330 --> 10:19.590]  You're basically just walking around holding the universe.
[10:19.590 --> 10:20.890]  Yeah, exactly.
[10:21.350 --> 10:23.690]  I would say that
[10:23.690 --> 10:25.430]  my game is crashing
[10:25.430 --> 10:27.610]  when I was doing this like every 45
[10:27.610 --> 10:29.710]  minutes or so. Like it's, I feel
[10:29.710 --> 10:31.810]  like I'm crashing way more than the average player
[10:31.810 --> 10:33.790]  just cause every time I load in
[10:33.790 --> 10:35.550]  somewhere it has to load all that stuff
[10:35.550 --> 10:37.530]  as well. You're that
[10:38.470 --> 10:40.050]  universe's encyclopedia Britannica.
[10:40.690 --> 10:41.230]  I am!
[10:41.710 --> 10:43.630]  You wanna see something cool that I found?
[10:44.230 --> 10:45.830]  Especially if it's not Starfield related.
[10:46.150 --> 10:47.730]  Yeah. Oh no it is, it is Starfield.
[10:47.730 --> 10:49.330]  Sorry, it's the last Starfield thing.
[10:49.510 --> 10:51.530]  Look at this. Why do I get to throw this knot though?
[10:52.090 --> 10:53.550]  No, it is. Look at this Q-Tip alien.
[10:54.290 --> 10:55.350]  Look at this Q-Tip alien.
[10:55.890 --> 10:57.570]  Oh wow! That's weird.
[10:57.570 --> 10:59.510]  That's real weird. It's like a cotton top.
[10:59.950 --> 11:01.550]  It is. What was it called?
[11:02.190 --> 11:03.030]  I don't remember.
[11:03.910 --> 11:05.150]  Yeah, there's no way I remember.
[11:05.390 --> 11:07.710]  It's Q-Tip. Hey, uh, I have a
[11:07.710 --> 11:09.390]  life hack for you guys. Okay.
[11:10.170 --> 11:11.750]  Uh, I guess it's a life
[11:11.750 --> 11:13.610]  hack. It may just be like a
[11:13.610 --> 11:15.570]  pro tip. You let me know if there's a life...
[11:15.570 --> 11:17.390]  It's probably a pro tip. I have a pro tip for you guys.
[11:17.630 --> 11:19.650]  How about that? If you're going to hire a
[11:19.650 --> 11:21.050]  lawyer from like a
[11:21.450 --> 11:23.230]  law firm where a bunch of lawyers work,
[11:24.610 --> 11:25.750]  don't go to
[11:25.750 --> 11:27.050]  the... Emily and I found this out the other day.
[11:28.070 --> 11:29.370]  Don't schedule your appointment
[11:29.370 --> 11:30.770]  for first thing in the morning
[11:31.310 --> 11:33.550]  and then get there early enough because you don't want to be late
[11:33.550 --> 11:35.670]  because you've never driven there before. So you get there 10 or 15
[11:35.670 --> 11:37.310]  minutes early and then you sit in the parking lot.
[11:37.730 --> 11:39.370]  Don't do that because you're going to get to see
[11:39.370 --> 11:41.330]  what every lawyer looks like on their way
[11:41.330 --> 11:43.310]  into work and it is way less
[11:43.310 --> 11:45.210]  impressive to see them in like bike
[11:45.210 --> 11:47.270]  shorts and like sweats
[11:47.270 --> 11:48.870]  and like fucking
[11:48.870 --> 11:50.990]  their street clothes walking in.
[11:51.130 --> 11:53.070]  They change clothes once they get into the building
[11:53.070 --> 11:54.570]  apparently. We were like
[11:54.570 --> 11:56.790]  what the fuck are we... who are we hiring?
[11:57.330 --> 11:59.090]  So you don't want to like pre-see...
[11:59.090 --> 12:00.590]  You don't want to pre-see... You don't want pleasantries.
[12:01.050 --> 12:03.270]  No, you don't want lawyer pleasantries. You just don't want to
[12:03.270 --> 12:05.070]  see them going to work. You want to
[12:05.070 --> 12:07.110]  walk into the building and they're already in a suit
[12:07.110 --> 12:09.390]  behind a desk. You don't want to see the process
[12:09.390 --> 12:10.950]  from the car to the front door
[12:10.950 --> 12:12.930]  because you will lose all confidence.
[12:13.210 --> 12:14.750]  Do you think some of the people behind the desk
[12:14.750 --> 12:16.790]  are just dressed nice from the waist up?
[12:17.230 --> 12:18.910]  Yeah, it's just like a
[12:18.910 --> 12:19.190]  pandemic.
[12:20.670 --> 12:22.930]  That's my pro tip, I guess. Probably not a life
[12:22.930 --> 12:25.050]  hack. I agree. No, I like it because I feel
[12:25.050 --> 12:27.050]  like you're cursed no matter
[12:27.050 --> 12:29.170]  what. Like you either have to come to terms
[12:29.170 --> 12:31.050]  with hiring a lawyer that you saw
[12:31.050 --> 12:32.530]  in like super tight bike shorts
[12:33.770 --> 12:34.930]  or not pick
[12:34.930 --> 12:36.730]  them for that reason then learn they're like
[12:36.730 --> 12:38.750]  the best lawyer available and like
[12:38.750 --> 12:40.770]  lose to them or like have somehow
[12:40.770 --> 12:42.790]  them go against you and then know
[12:42.790 --> 12:44.750]  how dumb you are for not going with them
[12:44.750 --> 12:46.250]  because you saw them in bike shorts.
[12:46.490 --> 12:48.610]  And just like they just haven't put their
[12:48.610 --> 12:49.650]  selves together yet.
[12:49.830 --> 12:52.050]  They just look half asleep.
[12:52.290 --> 12:54.510]  They look like I would look walking into
[12:54.510 --> 12:55.790]  rooster teeth at 8 in the morning.
[12:56.650 --> 12:58.050]  No offense to them,
[12:58.550 --> 13:00.590]  they're human. Every human being probably
[13:00.590 --> 13:02.430]  looks like that at 8 in the morning.
[13:02.610 --> 13:04.610]  But goddamn, it doesn't instill confidence when you're talking
[13:04.610 --> 13:06.610]  about life planning and money.
[13:06.610 --> 13:08.550]  You know what I mean? I really liked
[13:08.550 --> 13:10.590]  Andrew's description of picking the lawyer
[13:10.590 --> 13:12.610]  or like not picking the lawyer or whatever, like it's an
[13:12.610 --> 13:13.390]  NBA roster.
[13:14.850 --> 13:16.570]  Like, oh yeah, I'm not gonna go with this guy.
[13:16.770 --> 13:18.610]  Didn't look good pre-draft, so
[13:18.610 --> 13:20.550]  I'm gonna go with a different lawyer. Oh man,
[13:20.570 --> 13:22.010]  he came back to beat us in the final.
[13:22.390 --> 13:24.470]  He's 6'6", but he's got really small
[13:24.470 --> 13:26.250]  hands and I'm worried about his ball control.
[13:26.570 --> 13:28.690]  He's definitely not the power forward
[13:28.690 --> 13:30.550]  that we're looking for at the moment, so
[13:30.550 --> 13:32.490]  we'll just move on. You gotta look at
[13:32.490 --> 13:34.590]  pen grip strength, you gotta look at
[13:34.590 --> 13:36.610]  just general cursive skills,
[13:36.770 --> 13:38.630]  memory tests. I watch
[13:38.630 --> 13:40.750]  The Legal Combine every year, I don't know what you guys are doing.
[13:41.750 --> 13:42.190]  What
[13:42.190 --> 13:44.050]  do you think the
[13:44.830 --> 13:46.430]  podcast equivalent to
[13:47.430 --> 13:48.370]  that would be?
[13:48.750 --> 13:50.490]  Like, are you looking for like, mic
[13:50.490 --> 13:52.670]  skills, or like what sort of
[13:52.670 --> 13:53.690]  like the draft call?
[13:53.970 --> 13:56.550]  The way you're talking in and out of
[13:56.550 --> 13:58.630]  the mic, it's a learned skill talking directly
[13:58.630 --> 14:00.530]  into the microphone. Well, that's good because
[14:00.530 --> 14:02.690]  this episode, Nick said I sound like shit, so
[14:03.270 --> 14:04.610]  Yeah, but then you said you were
[14:04.610 --> 14:05.430]  up his butt.
[14:06.990 --> 14:08.030]  Well, he said,
[14:08.350 --> 14:10.550]  is Gavin more echoey than usual? Are you recording
[14:10.550 --> 14:12.590]  in a different spot? I replied
[14:12.590 --> 14:14.510]  in your butt, which means
[14:14.510 --> 14:16.510]  no, I'm in the same spot,
[14:16.650 --> 14:18.730]  otherwise I would have said the different place I was in.
[14:19.270 --> 14:20.750]  How do you like them mic
[14:20.750 --> 14:21.110]  skills?
[14:22.910 --> 14:23.850]  You got him.
[14:24.750 --> 14:26.250]  I draft you number one.
[14:28.830 --> 14:30.410]  What do you think is the number
[14:30.410 --> 14:32.450]  one skill for a podcaster
[14:32.450 --> 14:34.130]  that you would look for in the draft?
[14:35.230 --> 14:36.290]  Oh, that's a tough
[14:36.290 --> 14:37.970]  question. Like, what do you think is the
[14:37.970 --> 14:40.330]  top skill? Maybe a
[14:40.330 --> 14:42.270]  nice voice. Oh,
[14:42.490 --> 14:44.330]  no, no. I don't think so.
[14:44.530 --> 14:46.330]  Because listen to this, like listen to this
[14:46.330 --> 14:47.890]  podcast, we all sound like shit.
[14:48.310 --> 14:50.410]  Yeah, that's why this podcast isn't on any
[14:50.410 --> 14:52.250]  top tens. Or look at a guy like Jack,
[14:52.310 --> 14:54.010]  who's got a great voice, but what does he do with it?
[14:55.930 --> 14:56.290]  Jesus.
[14:57.210 --> 14:58.370]  Yeah, fucking get him, man.
[14:58.370 --> 14:58.890]  Hell yeah.
[14:59.630 --> 15:01.250]  Do you have like a go-to
[15:02.730 --> 15:04.310]  smooth voice that you
[15:04.310 --> 15:05.390]  try sometimes, Eric?
[15:05.790 --> 15:08.190]  Because your voice is probably
[15:08.190 --> 15:10.350]  the easiest to pick out of
[15:10.350 --> 15:12.370]  this group. Yeah, but everyone says that
[15:12.370 --> 15:14.010]  I sound like Michael and I don't hear it,
[15:14.250 --> 15:16.330]  which is crazy. I don't either. But here's the thing,
[15:16.430 --> 15:18.150]  I think, I don't know if we've talked about this.
[15:18.430 --> 15:20.210]  If your voice had to travel down
[15:20.210 --> 15:22.390]  a pipe, the pipe
[15:22.390 --> 15:24.350]  is kinked. Yeah. And that's the only way
[15:24.350 --> 15:26.490]  I can describe your voice. I would describe
[15:26.490 --> 15:28.250]  Eric's voice as a gravel road.
[15:28.370 --> 15:30.490]  But I don't mean that negatively. It's just
[15:30.490 --> 15:32.670]  there's a lot of, there's a roughness to it.
[15:32.870 --> 15:34.270]  Thank you. But it's consistent.
[15:34.690 --> 15:36.030]  Yeah, I'm like a kinked pipe.
[15:36.490 --> 15:37.730]  So, I think
[15:39.250 --> 15:40.530]  that when I talk on
[15:40.530 --> 15:42.330]  the phone, my wife has made fun of me for this,
[15:42.390 --> 15:44.130]  I have a phone voice, and I learned it
[15:45.390 --> 15:46.490]  from my dad,
[15:46.810 --> 15:48.530]  I think, just hearing him on the
[15:48.530 --> 15:50.430]  phone all the time. And so, I
[15:50.430 --> 15:52.450]  guess that's, I do put on a voice when
[15:52.450 --> 15:54.670]  I have, I don't think about it,
[15:54.670 --> 15:56.590]  like I never really noticed, but I definitely
[15:56.590 --> 15:57.830]  put on a voice when I'm on the phone.
[15:58.350 --> 16:00.750]  You sound to me as if,
[16:00.870 --> 16:02.310]  you ever see The Secret of NIMH?
[16:02.750 --> 16:04.750]  You sound to me as if one of the
[16:04.750 --> 16:06.650]  rats from The Secret of NIMH got hit with like
[16:06.650 --> 16:08.310]  a ray gun, and then
[16:08.750 --> 16:10.590]  embiggened into a human person
[16:10.590 --> 16:12.630]  who's very well spoken, like a very
[16:12.630 --> 16:14.710]  well educated rat who becomes
[16:14.710 --> 16:16.230]  a human. Okay.
[16:16.530 --> 16:18.130]  Hello, is that Mr. Badour?
[16:19.210 --> 16:20.330]  Yeah, this is Eric.
[16:20.970 --> 16:22.650]  Just heard you have a pretty
[16:23.430 --> 16:24.550]  distinctive phone voice.
[16:24.910 --> 16:26.130]  Yeah, sounds,
[16:26.790 --> 16:28.550]  yeah, we can get that going,
[16:28.690 --> 16:29.550]  no problem, shouldn't be
[16:30.510 --> 16:32.670]  an issue at all. Okay, so you sound like a weird
[16:32.670 --> 16:34.490]  pilot. You sound like a... You go deeper.
[16:34.890 --> 16:36.310]  You go a little deeper. You deepen up.
[16:36.910 --> 16:38.010]  Gavin hung up on me.
[16:39.090 --> 16:40.590]  Does anybody else change their voice
[16:40.590 --> 16:42.730]  on the phone? Gavin, do you change your voice?
[16:43.230 --> 16:44.230]  Yeah, do you become American?
[16:44.750 --> 16:45.650]  No, definitely not.
[16:46.230 --> 16:47.030]  Are you sure?
[16:49.010 --> 16:49.810]  No, we've done
[16:50.630 --> 16:51.830]  we've done our phone
[16:51.830 --> 16:53.130]  voices recently on this, didn't we?
[16:53.590 --> 16:56.310]  Well, we've done phone calls recently, but I don't know if you were doing your phone voice.
[16:56.530 --> 16:57.870]  Yeah, we talked about the way
[16:57.870 --> 16:59.850]  you answer the phone. Oh, yeah, I think I'm the
[16:59.850 --> 17:00.510]  exact same.
[17:02.810 --> 17:03.730]  I think I'd go
[17:03.730 --> 17:04.370]  deep voice.
[17:05.470 --> 17:06.670]  Ring, ring, ring.
[17:06.830 --> 17:09.530]  Ring, ring, ring. What?
[17:10.970 --> 17:12.190]  Is that how you answer the phone?
[17:12.370 --> 17:13.890]  Hey, it's Geoff.
[17:14.890 --> 17:15.210]  What?
[17:17.530 --> 17:17.850]  Yeah.
[17:18.210 --> 17:19.210]  Can you not hear me?
[17:19.690 --> 17:22.110]  No, I can hear you. I'm good. How are you?
[17:22.950 --> 17:23.770]  It's been a while
[17:23.770 --> 17:24.850]  since we've spoken on the phone.
[17:25.990 --> 17:27.850]  While I do love to text you all day
[17:27.850 --> 17:29.790]  and all night, I just wanted to talk to you on the phone
[17:29.790 --> 17:31.910]  for a second. Geoff, I don't think we've ever had a phone
[17:31.910 --> 17:33.730]  call. We're doing it right now, you
[17:33.730 --> 17:34.330]  dipshit.
[17:35.610 --> 17:37.530]  I'm just saying, I don't think this has ever happened.
[17:37.990 --> 17:39.730]  You didn't even do a phone voice that was deeper
[17:39.730 --> 17:40.610]  like you were going to do.
[17:41.590 --> 17:43.430]  No, that was me.
[17:43.870 --> 17:45.770]  I was thinking back to draft
[17:45.770 --> 17:47.890]  assets for podcasters. I was not talking about
[17:47.890 --> 17:48.450]  phone voices.
[17:49.170 --> 17:51.730]  So if you wanted to have a smooth podcast
[17:51.730 --> 17:52.330]  voice,
[17:53.470 --> 17:54.610]  how would that go?
[17:55.190 --> 17:57.790]  Not well. I know that was a cue to
[17:57.790 --> 17:59.730]  try it, but not well would be the answer.
[18:01.210 --> 18:02.030]  Let's all
[18:02.030 --> 18:03.750]  try. So nobody
[18:03.750 --> 18:05.430]  feels embarrassed. Why don't all
[18:05.430 --> 18:07.630]  of us try our smooth podcast
[18:07.630 --> 18:09.750]  voices? Like an NPR type voice?
[18:09.810 --> 18:11.030]  Or what type of voice are we going for?
[18:11.470 --> 18:13.790]  Because there's different types of smooth.
[18:13.790 --> 18:15.050]  It could be like, ooh,
[18:15.730 --> 18:16.950]  coming up, Leia.
[18:17.510 --> 18:18.270]  A little bit of that.
[18:20.170 --> 18:21.870]  I realized it is
[18:21.870 --> 18:23.970]  echoing because my speakers were on this whole
[18:23.970 --> 18:25.390]  time. I knew it!
[18:30.290 --> 18:31.750]  Up your butt.
[18:35.250 --> 18:37.670]  I'll be honest, it's my lack of microphone
[18:37.670 --> 18:39.230]  skills have started to show.
[18:39.990 --> 18:41.870]  You've definitely fallen down the
[18:41.870 --> 18:44.010]  draft order. I'm sorry. You might be behind Andrew
[18:44.010 --> 18:45.430]  now. Oh my god.
[18:45.950 --> 18:47.670]  That is embarrassing.
[18:48.010 --> 18:49.830]  Is it? Because I still
[18:49.830 --> 18:51.830]  don't think you know what a draft is, so I don't think you know
[18:51.830 --> 18:53.810]  what any of that means. No, but the
[18:53.810 --> 18:55.990]  only reason I heard it is because I was doing
[18:55.990 --> 18:57.910]  my smooth podcast
[18:57.910 --> 18:59.890]  voice and it cut through the
[18:59.890 --> 19:00.290]  headphones.
[19:04.150 --> 19:05.530]  Oh, I suck.
[19:09.870 --> 19:10.710]  Oh, man.
[19:13.070 --> 19:13.790]  Listen, you're no
[19:13.790 --> 19:15.390]  crack rock in the first round, Gavin.
[19:15.850 --> 19:17.290]  But you're up there. You're good.
[19:18.250 --> 19:19.670]  We haven't decided on the next draft,
[19:19.750 --> 19:21.310]  have we? No, we have like
[19:21.310 --> 19:23.550]  12 of them that we can do, we just
[19:23.550 --> 19:25.590]  haven't locked one in. Yeah, we fucked around with
[19:25.590 --> 19:27.710]  the idea. We talked about the idea
[19:27.710 --> 19:29.050]  of like, coming up with our
[19:30.890 --> 19:31.610]  ultimate fruit...
[19:31.610 --> 19:32.930]  What was it? Ultimate flavors?
[19:32.930 --> 19:35.030]  Yeah, the flavor, the best flavor
[19:35.030 --> 19:37.170]  of each type. I don't know where we are in any of that
[19:37.170 --> 19:39.010]  stuff, to be honest with you. There's a lot.
[19:39.450 --> 19:40.990]  A lot going on. I feel like
[19:40.990 --> 19:43.050]  Geoff's, uh, I'm sorry
[19:43.050 --> 19:44.750]  bit that came out
[19:44.750 --> 19:46.930]  may have been the most polarizing
[19:46.930 --> 19:49.090]  piece of shit face since
[19:49.770 --> 19:50.650]  the pencil.
[19:51.130 --> 19:52.970]  If there's one thing I've learned in
[19:53.530 --> 19:55.090]  the last 20 years of my
[19:55.090 --> 19:57.270]  career, it's when I do a voice
[19:57.270 --> 19:59.250]  and any voice, it's polarizing.
[19:59.850 --> 20:01.170]  I don't do it very often,
[20:01.170 --> 20:02.630]  but I did that dumb
[20:02.630 --> 20:05.010]  sorry thing, and that was polarizing.
[20:05.390 --> 20:06.970]  Years ago, I used to mimic
[20:06.970 --> 20:09.010]  Trevor from GTA in GTA
[20:09.010 --> 20:11.370]  videos, and people would be like, I'm gonna unsubscribe
[20:11.370 --> 20:12.750]  from Achievement Hunter if you don't stop.
[20:13.130 --> 20:14.450]  Well, to be fair, that wasn't
[20:15.130 --> 20:17.070]  so much mimicking Trevor, it was just
[20:18.290 --> 20:18.690]  going...
[20:19.410 --> 20:21.230]  for like 50 minutes.
[20:22.330 --> 20:23.350]  It wasn't like that, it was like...
[20:25.330 --> 20:26.230]  That's pretty good.
[20:26.850 --> 20:29.230]  I think that's good. I haven't played the game in a while, but
[20:29.230 --> 20:30.470]  that sounds like Trevor to me.
[20:31.850 --> 20:32.330]  Yeah!
[20:33.010 --> 20:35.230]  I will say, if the I'm sorry one
[20:35.230 --> 20:37.010]  wasn't it, it was the punchlines bit.
[20:37.190 --> 20:39.050]  That was...
[20:39.050 --> 20:41.210]  That really sent people one
[20:41.210 --> 20:42.010]  way or the other.
[20:44.250 --> 20:45.310]  Maybe we should
[20:46.450 --> 20:47.250]  chill out on
[20:47.250 --> 20:49.230]  these polarizing parts that we're on.
[20:49.930 --> 20:51.270]  Maybe you should give us the
[20:51.270 --> 20:53.390]  punchline more than 40
[20:53.390 --> 20:55.190]  minutes before we record the thing.
[20:56.510 --> 20:57.430]  Well, I said
[20:57.430 --> 20:59.350]  we didn't have to damn do it that time,
[20:59.470 --> 21:01.590]  and I also said I didn't even know what we would come up
[21:01.590 --> 21:03.510]  with. It was a terrible bit, and I
[21:03.510 --> 21:05.550]  tried to take the bullet.
[21:05.890 --> 21:07.030]  More time would have been nice.
[21:08.150 --> 21:09.550]  More time would have been nice, that's all I'm
[21:09.550 --> 21:10.430]  saying. It was a great bit.
[21:12.730 --> 21:13.490]  I am in
[21:13.490 --> 21:15.470]  a real pretzel, Gavin. I don't know what to
[21:15.470 --> 21:17.370]  do. Maybe you can help me through this. I've talked to
[21:17.370 --> 21:19.410]  Geoff about this a little bit. I don't
[21:19.410 --> 21:21.170]  know what to do. I am in
[21:22.290 --> 21:23.670]  a Geoff family
[21:23.670 --> 21:25.410]  college football pick-up league.
[21:25.990 --> 21:27.330]  Yes. And
[21:27.330 --> 21:29.530]  I am killing it.
[21:29.690 --> 21:31.250]  I'm doing great. Week 2,
[21:31.490 --> 21:33.390]  I went 9-1 for picks. You have to
[21:33.390 --> 21:35.410]  make 10 picks every week. I believe...
[21:36.090 --> 21:37.090]  Can I briefly interrupt?
[21:37.490 --> 21:39.290]  Yeah. I don't know anything
[21:39.290 --> 21:41.050]  that you've said so far. No, that's fine.
[21:41.430 --> 21:42.730]  Let me explain it, Gavin.
[21:43.710 --> 21:44.590]  Emily's family,
[21:45.250 --> 21:47.350]  my soon-to-be family, as I'm marrying
[21:47.350 --> 21:49.310]  into the family, you know Kent
[21:49.310 --> 21:51.450]  and Dwight. We went
[21:51.450 --> 21:53.410]  to Vegas together. You were there with them. You had
[21:53.410 --> 21:55.530]  many conversations. You sat right next to them at a restaurant.
[21:55.590 --> 21:57.510]  Yep. I remember. For like three straight days
[21:57.510 --> 21:59.410]  you were around them constantly. Big time.
[21:59.570 --> 22:00.630]  Yep. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22:01.950 --> 22:03.510]  College football happens every year,
[22:03.570 --> 22:05.470]  right? They play a series of games
[22:06.130 --> 22:07.610]  and every year
[22:07.610 --> 22:09.290]  we do what's called a college pick-em
[22:09.290 --> 22:11.450]  where you do this little ESPN
[22:11.450 --> 22:13.350]  app and it says, hey, who do you think is going to win these
[22:13.350 --> 22:15.550]  10 games? And then you pick
[22:15.550 --> 22:17.390]  and then we all go against each other
[22:17.390 --> 22:19.430]  and then whoever does the best at the end of the year gets to make
[22:19.430 --> 22:21.310]  fun of everybody else. And we
[22:21.310 --> 22:22.890]  invited Andrew in this year
[22:23.850 --> 22:24.730]  and he's
[22:25.190 --> 22:27.210]  mopping up the fucking floor with all
[22:27.210 --> 22:29.110]  of us. Me, Emily,
[22:29.830 --> 22:31.350]  Kent, her dad,
[22:31.470 --> 22:32.830]  her uncle, her cousin,
[22:33.110 --> 22:35.310]  just all of us. To the point where he's like ruining all the
[22:35.310 --> 22:37.070]  fun? Yeah, the family, we're all gonna
[22:37.070 --> 22:38.950]  have to quit and start a different one without him.
[22:39.090 --> 22:41.170]  So this is the problem. I am
[22:41.170 --> 22:43.130]  so clueless, I actually accidentally made
[22:43.130 --> 22:45.130]  two teams in that league and for
[22:45.130 --> 22:47.090]  the first two weeks I was first and
[22:47.090 --> 22:49.310]  third place. I'm doing really
[22:49.310 --> 22:51.330]  well. I dropped the third place team once
[22:51.330 --> 22:53.370]  I realized. Because I got invited to multiple
[22:53.370 --> 22:54.870]  leagues, so I got confused.
[22:55.230 --> 22:57.370]  And I don't use ESPN all that often for that type of stuff.
[22:57.810 --> 22:59.030]  Here's my problem, Gavin.
[22:59.610 --> 23:01.510]  The second week we did this,
[23:01.610 --> 23:02.990]  out of the 10 picks, I
[23:02.990 --> 23:05.130]  picked 9 correct and 1 wrong.
[23:05.550 --> 23:07.270]  I think I'm first in a league through
[23:07.270 --> 23:08.950]  3 weeks. I
[23:08.950 --> 23:11.310]  know absolutely nothing about
[23:11.310 --> 23:13.450]  college football. I don't watch college
[23:13.450 --> 23:15.170]  football, I'm just randomly
[23:15.170 --> 23:17.390]  picking. And I joined... You're just picking based
[23:17.390 --> 23:18.750]  on random names?
[23:19.250 --> 23:21.230]  Names and just like, ah, I feel like
[23:21.230 --> 23:23.410]  they might win this. And it also shows
[23:23.410 --> 23:25.430]  the picking percentage of like 90%
[23:25.430 --> 23:27.530]  of people pick this. So sometimes they go with that.
[23:27.650 --> 23:29.410]  Sometimes they'll go, ooh, I think this is
[23:29.410 --> 23:31.030]  an underdog because it's 60,
[23:31.550 --> 23:32.850]  40, and I'll go with the 40.
[23:33.170 --> 23:34.690]  So it's just a total
[23:35.370 --> 23:37.290]  guessing process by me. And I thought
[23:37.290 --> 23:39.290]  I was so flattered
[23:39.290 --> 23:41.430]  to be invited and it's like, oh, this would be a fun thing
[23:41.430 --> 23:42.970]  to play in, but I didn't really care that much.
[23:43.310 --> 23:45.090]  But after I was first in week 1,
[23:45.090 --> 23:47.010]  I was like, oh, fuck, I guess
[23:47.010 --> 23:49.090]  I kind of care about it. I guess I want to try to
[23:49.090 --> 23:50.870]  keep this going. Then I went 9-1
[23:50.870 --> 23:53.010]  in week 2, solidified myself
[23:53.010 --> 23:55.090]  as the first. Week 3
[23:55.090 --> 23:56.450]  I think I also did really well.
[23:56.990 --> 23:58.610]  I don't know how to continue.
[23:58.770 --> 24:00.970]  This is not sustainable because I'm just
[24:00.970 --> 24:02.890]  guessing and I'm not doing any
[24:02.890 --> 24:05.050]  research. But whenever I do research
[24:05.050 --> 24:06.950]  in other sports I care about, I
[24:06.950 --> 24:09.050]  do way worse than this. So I just
[24:09.050 --> 24:11.010]  don't know what to do. Oh yeah, you have to keep doing
[24:11.010 --> 24:13.110]  it the way you're doing it. It's just, I feel like
[24:13.110 --> 24:15.390]  there's no winning for me because if I do research
[24:15.390 --> 24:16.850]  I feel like that will lead to me
[24:17.330 --> 24:19.050]  overthinking and I'll screw it up. But I
[24:19.050 --> 24:21.010]  also want to keep winning, so
[24:21.010 --> 24:22.830]  it feels like I should be doing research.
[24:23.070 --> 24:25.210]  It's a nightmare. I've accidentally
[24:25.210 --> 24:27.250]  entered a nightmare. So I've been where you are
[24:27.250 --> 24:29.250]  Andrew, and let me describe it as this.
[24:29.850 --> 24:31.090]  It's the more I pay
[24:31.090 --> 24:32.870]  attention to it, the worse I do.
[24:33.610 --> 24:35.110]  But the more I do it, the more I want
[24:35.110 --> 24:37.010]  to pay attention to it. Yeah. It's frustrating.
[24:37.410 --> 24:38.710]  You know? It's terrible. Yeah.
[24:38.890 --> 24:40.470]  It is terrible. I was definitely
[24:41.330 --> 24:42.410]  better the year before
[24:42.410 --> 24:44.490]  last than I was last year than I'm
[24:44.490 --> 24:46.610]  doing terribly this year. And I've paid more attention
[24:47.030 --> 24:47.750]  each week
[24:48.410 --> 24:49.830]  since I started three years ago.
[24:50.270 --> 24:51.950]  It's not even a thing that I can
[24:52.310 --> 24:54.250]  follow because I thought, oh maybe I'll watch games.
[24:54.370 --> 24:56.150]  There just isn't a lot available
[24:56.150 --> 24:58.470]  to me in Canada. Like they just don't air
[24:58.470 --> 25:00.450]  those in the same way they do in the US.
[25:01.110 --> 25:02.310]  So I'm stuck. But it's just
[25:02.310 --> 25:04.350]  I feel like I'm pretzeled mentally of like, I don't know
[25:04.350 --> 25:06.090]  what to do. I guess I just gotta keep not caring.
[25:06.490 --> 25:08.430]  And just hope. Or maybe
[25:08.430 --> 25:10.250]  come to terms with, this isn't sustainable.
[25:11.010 --> 25:12.450]  That has been a frustration
[25:12.450 --> 25:14.450]  I'm doing. It's like the best I've ever
[25:14.450 --> 25:16.410]  done at anything, but I can't enjoy it because I'm
[25:16.410 --> 25:18.550]  constantly like, I'm gonna fuck this up next week.
[25:18.810 --> 25:20.450]  I'm gonna get one right. I'm gonna go
[25:20.450 --> 25:22.350]  nine losses, one win.
[25:22.990 --> 25:24.470]  Would you rather it go downhill because
[25:24.470 --> 25:26.370]  of the research you've put in or because
[25:26.370 --> 25:28.130]  your luck just ran out doing it blind?
[25:28.870 --> 25:29.790]  See, I feel like
[25:30.390 --> 25:32.490]  no matter what, I'll spin zone it into being
[25:32.490 --> 25:34.570]  a negative for me. So if I do
[25:34.570 --> 25:36.510]  the research and I lose,
[25:36.510 --> 25:38.510]  I'll say, I'm an idiot, why did I do that?
[25:38.750 --> 25:40.730]  But if I don't do research
[25:40.730 --> 25:42.630]  and I lose, I can then argue, well, if I
[25:42.630 --> 25:44.630]  did the research, I would have been able to just
[25:44.630 --> 25:46.770]  keep it going. And so lose-lose.
[25:47.210 --> 25:48.550]  My brain is just gonna screw me
[25:48.550 --> 25:50.530]  over no matter what I do, I guess is the
[25:50.530 --> 25:52.510]  ultimate thing. I think I just gotta keep
[25:52.510 --> 25:54.470]  going. I gotta keep doing what's working,
[25:54.710 --> 25:56.710]  I guess, and just see how long it lasts.
[25:59.110 --> 26:00.590]  It's been a pain.
[26:01.130 --> 26:01.970]  Is there any money involved?
[26:02.530 --> 26:04.110]  No. The winner
[26:04.110 --> 26:05.890]  has to buy dinner
[26:05.890 --> 26:08.090]  for everybody that they beat. That's just the
[26:08.090 --> 26:08.610]  only thing.
[26:11.090 --> 26:12.230]  That's not a real
[26:12.230 --> 26:12.830]  thing.
[26:14.410 --> 26:16.090]  That's what we're all
[26:16.090 --> 26:17.670]  gonna decide if you win this year, yeah.
[26:17.750 --> 26:20.210]  Well, if it's a real thing, then I hope y'all enjoy
[26:20.210 --> 26:22.030]  some fuckin' fry smiles
[26:22.030 --> 26:23.450]  or whatever they're called.
[26:24.090 --> 26:25.270]  Potato smiles, yeah.
[26:25.830 --> 26:28.230]  You're gonna have that. I'll get some Kool-Aid,
[26:28.290 --> 26:30.330]  I'll get the Kool-Aid mix that you got,
[26:30.790 --> 26:32.170]  and potato smiles
[26:32.170 --> 26:32.750]  for everybody.
[26:34.150 --> 26:36.150]  Well, except for the fact that potato smiles are fuckin'
[26:36.610 --> 26:37.390]  bland and gross.
[26:38.050 --> 26:40.230]  Emily and I tried to eat them again later, and we cooked the shit
[26:40.230 --> 26:42.070]  out of them. They're just so uninteresting.
[26:42.430 --> 26:44.230]  Yeah, they're not. They are such
[26:44.230 --> 26:46.230]  a bad mix between a hash brown
[26:46.230 --> 26:47.730]  and a fuckin' tater tot.
[26:48.310 --> 26:50.250]  They are a low tier fry. I would agree.
[26:50.270 --> 26:51.490]  They are a low tier.
[26:51.910 --> 26:54.050]  I like a crinkle cut, I like a curly,
[26:54.170 --> 26:55.830]  as long as it has the appropriate seasoning.
[26:56.310 --> 26:57.930]  Do you think maybe a fry draft
[26:57.930 --> 26:59.730]  is in our future? Oh!
[27:00.910 --> 27:01.390]  Well,
[27:01.390 --> 27:03.690]  it'd have to be maybe a potato draft,
[27:03.810 --> 27:05.390]  cause are there enough... are there
[27:05.390 --> 27:06.930]  twelve kinds of fries?
[27:07.470 --> 27:09.790]  Well, it's gonna get into a really weird argument
[27:09.790 --> 27:11.290]  of like, is a tater tot a fry?
[27:11.750 --> 27:13.670]  Yes. I don't think we can
[27:13.670 --> 27:15.690]  handle another tot-related argument.
[27:15.850 --> 27:16.530]  Potato draft.
[27:18.430 --> 27:20.030]  Potato draft could definitely work.
[27:20.330 --> 27:21.010]  Yeah, apparently
[27:21.950 --> 27:23.510]  Gracie is so on board for
[27:23.510 --> 27:25.310]  potato draft, putting it in all caps.
[27:25.370 --> 27:25.710]  Oh!
[27:25.710 --> 27:25.870]  Oh!
[27:27.030 --> 27:29.670]  There you go. I think there's only one
[27:29.670 --> 27:30.250]  bad potato.
[27:30.870 --> 27:33.550]  I like the idea of going from fools
[27:33.550 --> 27:35.070]  to nut rocks
[27:35.070 --> 27:36.490]  to bulls
[27:36.490 --> 27:37.770]  to potatoes.
[27:39.070 --> 27:41.170]  To TV ads to potatoes.
[27:42.590 --> 27:43.670]  TV ads is great.
[27:44.230 --> 27:45.710]  Could I draft chili cheese fries?
[27:46.590 --> 27:47.110]  Yeah.
[27:47.510 --> 27:48.730]  Although I probably will now.
[27:49.330 --> 27:49.530]  What?
[27:50.670 --> 27:53.470]  Well, when we do the draft, if I get ahead of you, I probably will,
[27:53.470 --> 27:54.430]  because I love chili cheese fries.
[27:54.530 --> 27:57.690]  So you reminded me.
[27:57.910 --> 27:59.610]  Okay, but then if that's the case, could I just do
[27:59.610 --> 28:00.390]  cheese fries?
[28:01.570 --> 28:02.890]  Yeah, that's where it becomes a problem.
[28:04.230 --> 28:05.150]  That's why I'm asking.
[28:05.510 --> 28:06.850]  Those are two different things on a menu.
[28:08.010 --> 28:09.690]  And some restaurants have one and not the other.
[28:10.250 --> 28:11.510]  That's a great qualifier, Geoff.
[28:12.030 --> 28:13.790]  I love that. That makes it a lot easier.
[28:13.790 --> 28:14.750]  Oh, Andrew. Yes, Gavin?
[28:14.750 --> 28:17.010]  What did you think of the strumming video?
[28:17.390 --> 28:19.470]  Oh! Thank you so much for
[28:19.470 --> 28:21.310]  bringing that up. I was going to put that in my notes.
[28:21.310 --> 28:23.170]  I forgot. What a great video.
[28:23.530 --> 28:25.050]  Great editing by you, Gavin.
[28:25.490 --> 28:27.270]  I think it's a lot of fun to have you
[28:27.270 --> 28:29.430]  film gross things. To have the camera guy
[28:29.430 --> 28:30.750]  run away from the scene
[28:31.310 --> 28:33.470]  is great. It also
[28:33.470 --> 28:35.610]  hit notes of one of my favorite
[28:35.610 --> 28:37.510]  jackass bits of having the camera
[28:37.510 --> 28:39.350]  guy constantly on the verge of puking.
[28:39.630 --> 28:40.830]  It's very funny to me.
[28:42.370 --> 28:43.450]  Overall, I would
[28:43.450 --> 28:45.490]  say, Geoff, I have seen
[28:46.050 --> 28:47.410]  Olympic gold medal
[28:47.410 --> 28:49.270]  performances that were less
[28:49.270 --> 28:50.930]  impressive than your nose flaps.
[28:51.050 --> 28:53.050]  I was very impressed. Oh! Well, thank you.
[28:53.050 --> 28:55.230]  I can't believe that you held it down the way you did.
[28:55.770 --> 28:57.450]  I thought it was so funny
[28:57.450 --> 28:59.170]  seeing... I mean, I'm kind of spoiling the video.
[28:59.370 --> 29:01.190]  But the fact that you were so unaffected
[29:01.190 --> 29:02.930]  by it was incredible.
[29:03.870 --> 29:05.230]  I think it was a great take. I think I was
[29:05.230 --> 29:07.230]  most blown away by the fact that
[29:07.230 --> 29:09.150]  you could hear the nose flaps once
[29:09.150 --> 29:11.170]  they were activated. You could hear the nasal voice
[29:11.170 --> 29:13.330]  come through. Oh, the noise. Yeah, the voice.
[29:13.390 --> 29:15.370]  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I didn't consider
[29:15.370 --> 29:16.990]  that. People were like,
[29:16.990 --> 29:18.750]  he's just not breathing through his nose. And I'm like,
[29:18.790 --> 29:21.150]  I never said... all I said was I could stop smelling.
[29:21.330 --> 29:22.870]  All I said was I can turn
[29:22.870 --> 29:24.930]  off smell. And I do
[29:24.930 --> 29:26.850]  that by closing my nose flaps. I can
[29:26.850 --> 29:28.570]  feel it. And it makes my voice sound differently.
[29:28.890 --> 29:30.910]  But I'm still breathing and alive.
[29:31.230 --> 29:32.890]  I was in that... I didn't die in there.
[29:33.570 --> 29:35.190]  You're not talking to the ghost of Geoff.
[29:35.570 --> 29:37.070]  Because I stopped breathing for a minute.
[29:37.730 --> 29:39.030]  Yeah, I mean, I can stop
[29:39.030 --> 29:40.750]  breathing through my nose. But I think there's
[29:40.750 --> 29:42.630]  leakage. There's like sinus leakage.
[29:42.970 --> 29:44.290]  And I still end up smelling stuff.
[29:44.290 --> 29:46.330]  If it's just a slight movement
[29:46.330 --> 29:48.190]  of a valve, it will shift air enough
[29:48.190 --> 29:50.390]  for me to still smell. You've got to clamp
[29:50.390 --> 29:51.850]  that shit down hard.
[29:52.250 --> 29:53.190]  Like, I'm flex...
[29:53.190 --> 29:56.370]  Maybe I should say this. When I'm closing
[29:56.370 --> 29:58.290]  my nose flaps, it's like
[29:58.290 --> 29:59.350]  the equivalent of
[30:00.850 --> 30:01.910]  flexing your guns.
[30:02.450 --> 30:03.950]  Right? Like doing a pose.
[30:04.470 --> 30:06.390]  Yeah, like Arnold Schwarzenegger doing a pose
[30:06.390 --> 30:08.050]  for Mr. Olympia. That's what I'm doing
[30:08.050 --> 30:09.150]  inside my nose.
[30:09.970 --> 30:12.190]  Did your nose feel exhausted?
[30:12.190 --> 30:14.210]  Yes. Yeah, it'll wear you out
[30:14.210 --> 30:14.630]  after a while.
[30:15.910 --> 30:18.150]  I think it's really...
[30:18.150 --> 30:19.910]  It's the use of nose flaps
[30:19.910 --> 30:21.650]  that made it so jarring to hear.
[30:22.190 --> 30:23.950]  Like, you saying nose... describing
[30:23.950 --> 30:25.690]  yourself as having nose flaps
[30:25.690 --> 30:28.010]  gives me imagery of like, you're the
[30:28.010 --> 30:29.590]  fish guy from The Shape of Water.
[30:29.850 --> 30:31.970]  Where if you just would have said, I could block
[30:31.970 --> 30:34.110]  scent, I don't think my brain goes
[30:34.110 --> 30:36.070]  there. Yeah, no, it feels like what
[30:36.070 --> 30:38.270]  you're describing. Like the fish guy from The Shape of Water.
[30:38.510 --> 30:40.030]  I feel like that's accurate on
[30:40.030 --> 30:42.190]  the inside. And what I love
[30:42.190 --> 30:44.010]  is that like, you know, maybe 5 or
[30:44.010 --> 30:46.030]  10% of the people that... comment
[30:46.030 --> 30:48.130]  leavers that mention it
[30:49.050 --> 30:50.070]  totally understand what
[30:50.070 --> 30:51.950]  I'm talking about. And a lot of people say
[30:51.950 --> 30:53.950]  I can do that, but it doesn't feel like nose flaps.
[30:54.130 --> 30:56.030]  But there are a subset
[30:56.030 --> 30:58.330]  of the community that definitely
[30:59.030 --> 30:59.970]  say I'm describing
[30:59.970 --> 31:01.650]  it the exact same way that they feel it.
[31:01.710 --> 31:02.950]  So I know it's not just me.
[31:03.450 --> 31:05.390]  Can I stick my little thing up your nose?
[31:05.830 --> 31:08.290]  The little camera?
[31:08.290 --> 31:09.450]  Oh, the camera.
[31:10.070 --> 31:12.170]  Yeah, whatever. You can put whatever you want up my nose.
[31:12.890 --> 31:14.230]  That was the one shot
[31:14.230 --> 31:16.290]  that I expected. Oh, like up the nose
[31:16.290 --> 31:18.270]  shot? Yeah, just to see what was going on
[31:18.270 --> 31:19.510]  in there when he was closing the flaps.
[31:19.990 --> 31:22.230]  Yeah, we should do a little follow-up.
[31:22.490 --> 31:24.170]  Because I've got a little camera with a light on it, and I would
[31:24.170 --> 31:26.110]  love to see if anything physically moves
[31:26.790 --> 31:28.170]  when you go nasal like that.
[31:28.490 --> 31:29.650]  Yeah, I would love to see that too.
[31:29.810 --> 31:32.190]  I just can't get the thought of Geoff being like
[31:32.190 --> 31:34.270]  a reverse fish out of my head
[31:34.270 --> 31:36.490]  now. Of like, he has gills
[31:36.490 --> 31:38.570]  but they're in the wrong way, and instead
[31:38.570 --> 31:40.530]  of allowing breathing, it prevents breathing.
[31:40.910 --> 31:42.690]  Isn't a human kind of a reverse
[31:42.690 --> 31:43.050]  fish?
[31:48.610 --> 31:50.750]  I mean, fish live in the water
[31:50.750 --> 31:52.350]  and breathe water.
[31:52.510 --> 31:54.690]  We live outside of the water and breathe air.
[31:55.090 --> 31:56.470]  We're kind of like opposites.
[31:58.350 --> 32:00.750]  I'd argue that I live more in the water than outside
[32:00.750 --> 32:01.350]  of the water.
[32:02.890 --> 32:03.830]  Depending on the week.
[32:04.470 --> 32:05.770]  Have you been tubbing
[32:05.770 --> 32:07.830]  hard recently? Not recently, no, but there are
[32:07.830 --> 32:09.950]  definite times where I've been tubbing hard.
[32:10.010 --> 32:10.970]  I've been hitting those tubs hard.
[32:12.370 --> 32:13.850]  Relaxing. Would you say
[32:13.850 --> 32:15.750]  you're the biggest tub lord of Vancouver
[32:15.750 --> 32:17.810]  Island? No, I wouldn't describe myself
[32:17.810 --> 32:18.910]  as a tub lord ever.
[32:22.190 --> 32:23.870]  Big tub guy, not a
[32:23.870 --> 32:25.670]  tub lord. Andrew Tublord Panton,
[32:25.790 --> 32:26.690]  as he likes to be called.
[32:27.170 --> 32:29.750]  I take a lot of baths, so I'd say I'm a
[32:29.750 --> 32:31.810]  tub guy, but I'm not anywhere near
[32:31.810 --> 32:33.030]  the lordship that you carry.
[32:33.350 --> 32:35.870]  No, it's like I'm an endurance runner for bathing.
[32:36.530 --> 32:37.710]  Like if you say you have a 30 minute
[32:37.710 --> 32:39.230]  bath, whatever, that's
[32:39.230 --> 32:41.590]  the early... we're just getting started.
[32:41.970 --> 32:43.670]  We're still trying to get the water temperature right
[32:43.670 --> 32:44.150]  at that point.
[32:44.870 --> 32:47.610]  I think I only take a bath
[32:47.610 --> 32:48.270]  when I'm sick.
[32:49.790 --> 32:51.370]  It's a good time to take a bath. Like if you've got
[32:51.370 --> 32:53.730]  a stuffed up nose, or you don't feel well,
[32:53.750 --> 32:55.630]  your body aches, you put some Epsom salts
[32:55.630 --> 32:57.670]  in and you just lay there for a while and enjoy
[32:57.670 --> 32:58.970]  the heat and try to open up the...
[32:58.970 --> 33:00.950]  It could be the only time I think I've taken
[33:00.950 --> 33:03.150]  a bath would be... I don't know.
[33:03.330 --> 33:04.610]  Maybe when I had COVID last.
[33:05.190 --> 33:07.030]  Did you spend much time as a kid hunched
[33:07.030 --> 33:08.970]  over a boiling bowl of
[33:08.970 --> 33:10.790]  water with Vic's vapor rub in it?
[33:12.130 --> 33:12.570]  Mmm...
[33:12.570 --> 33:14.690]  I was with you up until the vapor rub.
[33:15.590 --> 33:17.250]  I spent an amount of time...
[33:17.250 --> 33:19.110]  Yeah, when I had my...
[33:19.110 --> 33:21.070]  I used to be one of those
[33:21.070 --> 33:23.230]  kids that if I got a cold
[33:23.710 --> 33:25.190]  I would get strep throat.
[33:25.610 --> 33:26.770]  Like every time.
[33:26.770 --> 33:28.690]  I never had a cold. I only ever got strep throat
[33:28.690 --> 33:30.090]  and I would get it like 3 or 4 times a year.
[33:30.490 --> 33:32.510]  And I was always sick and they had me
[33:33.410 --> 33:34.750]  so... my sinuses were so
[33:34.750 --> 33:36.710]  bad in middle school that I missed
[33:36.710 --> 33:38.750]  a month of school because they had to
[33:38.750 --> 33:40.810]  put me on some medication and I
[33:40.810 --> 33:42.550]  couldn't go up and down stairs
[33:42.550 --> 33:44.690]  and I was all like loopy and so I missed almost an
[33:44.690 --> 33:46.550]  entire month of school and then
[33:46.550 --> 33:48.710]  when I got my jaw surgery they like cleaned out
[33:48.710 --> 33:50.450]  my adenoids and fixed my
[33:51.270 --> 33:52.790]  passageways and then I never got sick
[33:52.790 --> 33:54.690]  like that again. My entire childhood was
[33:54.690 --> 33:56.730]  what you're describing, yeah. Do you think that was around
[33:56.730 --> 33:58.390]  the time they were teaching roman numerals?
[33:59.390 --> 34:00.250]  Well, third...
[34:00.250 --> 34:02.650]  That was third grade so it would have covered it, yeah, for sure.
[34:08.280 --> 34:10.260]  It's the best time of year. I mean
[34:10.260 --> 34:12.280]  we're in that fall season, it's
[34:12.280 --> 34:14.240]  spooky, it's great, there's just
[34:14.240 --> 34:16.280]  so many things about it I love. The leaves
[34:16.280 --> 34:18.480]  changing, cozy vibes,
[34:18.660 --> 34:20.180]  and my personal favorite
[34:20.180 --> 34:22.480]  holiday, Raycon's anniversary.
[34:23.020 --> 34:24.300]  And if you're thinking, don't
[34:24.300 --> 34:25.380]  you mean Halloween?
[34:25.380 --> 34:27.300]  Then let me ask you this,
[34:27.580 --> 34:29.400]  does Halloween also give
[34:29.400 --> 34:31.620]  20-40% off premium electronics?
[34:32.120 --> 34:33.300]  No? Then
[34:33.300 --> 34:35.380]  listen up, because Raycon's celebrating their
[34:35.380 --> 34:37.360]  anniversary with a sale you don't
[34:37.360 --> 34:39.420]  want to miss. It's a fantastic sale.
[34:39.620 --> 34:41.120]  You'd be haunted. To miss it
[34:41.120 --> 34:43.360]  would truly be spooky and you would
[34:43.360 --> 34:45.320]  be haunting yourself. You might have
[34:45.320 --> 34:47.380]  heard me mention Raycon's anniversary sale before
[34:47.380 --> 34:49.300]  this year. Raycon is turning
[34:49.300 --> 34:51.480]  six. In that time, Raycon
[34:51.480 --> 34:53.640]  has really made a name for themselves in the premium
[34:53.640 --> 34:55.580]  audio space. Their everyday
[34:55.580 --> 34:57.540]  earbuds are known for delivering high quality
[34:57.540 --> 34:59.460]  and thoughtful features like a
[34:59.460 --> 35:01.840]  32-hour battery life and a perfect
[35:01.840 --> 35:03.440]  in-ear fit for all-day wear
[35:03.440 --> 35:05.660]  and lasting comfort. All
[35:05.660 --> 35:07.860]  this at half the price of other premium
[35:07.860 --> 35:09.820]  brands. No wonder they've already racked
[35:09.820 --> 35:11.840]  up 78,000 5-star reviews.
[35:12.320 --> 35:13.540]  And this past year, they
[35:13.540 --> 35:15.600]  expanded their entire business with
[35:15.600 --> 35:17.640]  the introduction of Raycon
[35:17.640 --> 35:19.500]  Home and Raycon PowerTech.
[35:19.880 --> 35:21.680]  So needless to say, there's a lot
[35:21.680 --> 35:23.520]  to celebrate. To thank everyone
[35:23.520 --> 35:25.680]  who's shown them support in the past
[35:25.680 --> 35:27.700]  six years, Raycon is offering
[35:27.700 --> 35:29.660]  20% off everything on their site
[35:29.660 --> 35:31.680]  with select products up
[35:31.680 --> 35:33.340]  to 40% off.
[35:33.860 --> 35:35.540]  I love my Raycon
[35:35.540 --> 35:37.800]  everyday earbuds. They're great. They have fantastic
[35:37.800 --> 35:39.540]  battery life. They're just awesome
[35:39.540 --> 35:41.740]  to use. You do not want to miss out
[35:41.740 --> 35:43.280]  on Raycon's anniversary sale.
[35:43.740 --> 35:45.800]  What are you going to do? Wait another year for it?
[35:46.360 --> 35:47.720]  Celebrate Raycon turning six

[36:08.800 --> 36:09.640]  I had
[36:09.640 --> 36:11.540]  an idea. I like to run by
[36:11.540 --> 36:13.540]  you guys. Maybe this is a dumb thought.
[36:14.020 --> 36:15.460]  Maybe you like this idea.
[36:16.100 --> 36:17.140]  I have...
[36:18.780 --> 36:19.340]  I
[36:19.340 --> 36:20.940]  had to realize there are times
[36:20.940 --> 36:22.620]  on social media
[36:23.140 --> 36:25.000]  and this is largely for sports. I have a weird
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.140]  relationship with Twitter because
[36:27.140 --> 36:29.140]  even though someone might follow
[36:29.140 --> 36:30.940]  me, I just have an
[36:30.940 --> 36:33.460]  internal self-hatred.
[36:33.540 --> 36:34.700]  I don't know if that's the right word for it.
[36:34.860 --> 36:37.080]  I just feel like nothing I post is worth
[36:37.080 --> 36:38.920]  anyone seeing and that by
[36:38.920 --> 36:41.140]  posting anything, especially
[36:41.140 --> 36:43.420]  specific interests like hockey stuff,
[36:44.040 --> 36:45.140]  it's just wasting people's
[36:45.140 --> 36:46.960]  time. Nobody needs to see this.
[36:47.620 --> 36:48.520]  And the upcoming
[36:49.140 --> 36:51.140]  Canucks season is probably
[36:51.140 --> 36:53.160]  the most important NHL
[36:53.160 --> 36:55.180]  season of my life in the
[36:55.180 --> 36:57.120]  sense of if they are bad
[36:57.120 --> 36:59.240]  this year, I kind of have to come to
[36:59.240 --> 37:01.360]  terms with the fact that they don't have a chance
[37:01.360 --> 37:02.640]  to be good again until
[37:02.640 --> 37:05.440]  probably 10 years from now for how the NHL
[37:05.440 --> 37:07.020]  works. So if we were in the middle of
[37:07.020 --> 37:09.020]  say like a break shit stream,
[37:09.120 --> 37:10.440]  you'd probably be watching this.
[37:11.100 --> 37:13.340]  Just like the season as a whole.
[37:13.340 --> 37:15.300]  Yeah, it's
[37:15.300 --> 37:17.280]  not the... listen, if we're in the playoffs
[37:17.280 --> 37:19.520]  or if we're in for anything, I would definitely do that.
[37:19.620 --> 37:21.700]  Yeah. If it was a playoff game?
[37:21.760 --> 37:23.260]  So you're saying you want to talk about
[37:23.260 --> 37:24.680]  hockey but you don't feel like you should?
[37:24.680 --> 37:27.020]  Yeah, exactly. There are times where
[37:27.020 --> 37:29.280]  and this is a season where it's gonna be
[37:29.280 --> 37:30.740]  a lot of pain or excitement
[37:30.740 --> 37:33.160]  and I typically just bottle that
[37:33.160 --> 37:35.360]  but I've been really happy this summer
[37:35.360 --> 37:37.240]  and I know if I bottle
[37:37.240 --> 37:39.020]  that type of thing that will reduce the happiness.
[37:39.400 --> 37:41.240]  Also just sometimes I will
[37:41.240 --> 37:43.440]  see things from people that I like
[37:43.440 --> 37:44.700]  where they're...
[37:45.240 --> 37:47.440]  We work in a space that
[37:47.440 --> 37:49.080]  is always trying to be funny
[37:49.080 --> 37:51.400]  constantly and I will see things
[37:51.400 --> 37:53.440]  that I think are funny but I know
[37:53.440 --> 37:54.660]  might annoy that person
[37:55.150 --> 37:57.060]  and I don't post them
[37:57.060 --> 37:59.320]  because I just don't want to deal with their annoyance
[37:59.320 --> 38:00.380]  and I don't want them to be upset. What's an example?
[38:01.840 --> 38:03.200]  I can't give an example.
[38:03.980 --> 38:05.260]  He doesn't want to do it
[38:05.260 --> 38:06.580]  He doesn't want to do it because...
[38:06.580 --> 38:08.840]  Dude, he doesn't want to do it because Eric is famous.
[38:09.520 --> 38:10.040]  Yes.
[38:10.520 --> 38:11.420]  Exactly right.
[38:12.060 --> 38:14.460]  I actually had one with Eric recently
[38:14.460 --> 38:16.880]  where I said, I just need to send
[38:16.880 --> 38:18.900]  this to someone because I can't
[38:18.900 --> 38:21.020]  I don't want to post this
[38:21.020 --> 38:22.900]  but I think it's funny and if I
[38:22.900 --> 38:24.500]  don't tell someone. And he agreed.
[38:24.880 --> 38:26.920]  Eric's response to it was, please don't post
[38:26.920 --> 38:28.960]  this. It was very funny
[38:28.960 --> 38:30.540]  and he should not post it.
[38:31.320 --> 38:32.360]  So my...
[38:32.360 --> 38:34.940]  I had this idea. Let's talk about this problem
[38:34.940 --> 38:36.760]  with Friend. I think
[38:36.760 --> 38:38.740]  I'm going to make a burner
[38:38.740 --> 38:40.640]  account but then the issue
[38:40.640 --> 38:42.360]  becomes, if you have a burner
[38:42.360 --> 38:44.320]  accidentally posting on your real account
[38:44.320 --> 38:46.880]  but I know for my time of having
[38:46.880 --> 38:48.760]  cheap Android phones, I could
[38:48.760 --> 38:50.960]  probably get like a $30 phone
[38:50.960 --> 38:52.800]  that I could access an app
[38:52.800 --> 38:54.860]  store with and I'm
[38:54.860 --> 38:57.040]  going to call it, I think, just my caviar
[38:57.040 --> 38:58.760]  phone. Whenever I'm feeling a little
[38:58.760 --> 39:00.820]  spicy, I hop on the
[39:00.820 --> 39:02.740]  caviar phone and I just have my burner.
[39:03.260 --> 39:04.760]  So whenever I'm upset about my hockey
[39:04.760 --> 39:06.700]  team or I have a
[39:06.700 --> 39:08.760]  joke that I think is funny but like I
[39:08.760 --> 39:10.500]  just know might not be great to tweet
[39:10.500 --> 39:12.540]  as far as like annoying somebody I care about
[39:13.560 --> 39:14.840]  I think I might have
[39:14.840 --> 39:16.780]  a burner caviar phone. Just the idea
[39:16.780 --> 39:18.440]  of having the caviar phone. I like the
[39:18.440 --> 39:20.360]  juxtaposition of a cheap piece of shit
[39:20.360 --> 39:22.600]  $30 phone being called the caviar
[39:22.600 --> 39:24.040]  phone as well. I think that's brilliant.
[39:25.420 --> 39:25.860]  So
[39:26.600 --> 39:28.700]  this account would be for hot
[39:28.700 --> 39:30.960]  sports takes and spicy
[39:30.960 --> 39:31.700]  jokes.
[39:32.920 --> 39:33.960]  Hot sports
[39:33.960 --> 39:35.920]  takes and spicy jokes might be a little
[39:35.920 --> 39:37.720]  too strong
[39:37.720 --> 39:39.660]  for both of those things. Not necessarily
[39:39.660 --> 39:41.760]  spicy but just like I need
[39:41.760 --> 39:43.840]  a place to complain that the third
[39:43.840 --> 39:45.720]  line pairing isn't working out
[39:45.720 --> 39:47.800]  and I know nobody needs to see that
[39:47.800 --> 39:48.520]  in my main feed.
[39:48.980 --> 39:51.600]  Let me approach this with
[39:52.500 --> 39:53.800]  someone, Andrew,
[39:53.900 --> 39:55.780]  that you and I both hold near and dear to our
[39:55.780 --> 39:57.740]  hearts. I'm sure
[39:57.740 --> 39:59.860]  rest in peace, you followed
[39:59.860 --> 40:01.740]  Norm McDonald when he was alive.
[40:03.780 --> 40:05.440]  I'm not on Twitter anymore. I haven't been
[40:05.440 --> 40:07.880]  in a long time. But when Norm was
[40:07.880 --> 40:09.440]  alive and on Twitter, he would
[40:09.440 --> 40:12.060]  incessantly post the most boring
[40:12.060 --> 40:13.500]  hot golf takes.
[40:14.000 --> 40:15.780]  And I don't think anybody complained
[40:15.780 --> 40:17.880]  or minded. You just knew
[40:17.880 --> 40:19.660]  that's what you were getting with Norm McDonald.
[40:19.780 --> 40:21.460]  So if he can get away with posting boring
[40:21.460 --> 40:23.380]  fucking golf takes, I'm sure
[40:24.080 --> 40:25.860]  people would be amenable to hearing you
[40:25.860 --> 40:27.960]  talk about hockey. But I don't think
[40:27.960 --> 40:29.960]  that I've earned that in the same way
[40:29.960 --> 40:32.080]  that Norm has. That works
[40:32.080 --> 40:33.920]  so well for Norm because of his
[40:33.920 --> 40:34.740]  style of comedy.
[40:35.380 --> 40:38.020]  Yeah, but you have followers of people who know
[40:38.020 --> 40:39.800]  who you are. Yeah, and also
[40:39.800 --> 40:41.840]  dude, you just pulled a very
[40:41.840 --> 40:43.940]  Norm McDonald style joke last week in
[40:43.940 --> 40:45.840]  the podcast. Yeah,
[40:46.040 --> 40:48.180]  but that is not nearly
[40:48.180 --> 40:49.620]  like, obviously,
[40:49.840 --> 40:51.180]  whatever his version of that would have been
[40:51.960 --> 40:54.000]  20,000 times
[40:54.000 --> 40:55.520]  funnier, just like infinitely better.
[40:55.520 --> 40:57.620]  So I'm just saying, like, I feel like that's
[40:57.620 --> 40:59.520]  his bit where that's not my bit. I think it's also
[40:59.520 --> 41:01.380]  just a mental hurdle of people
[41:01.380 --> 41:03.600]  are following me on a platform like that
[41:03.600 --> 41:05.760]  to hear what I'm thinking, I guess?
[41:05.960 --> 41:07.460]  But I have the issue
[41:07.460 --> 41:09.440]  of thinking that everything I say isn't worth
[41:09.440 --> 41:11.080]  posting. So it's a,
[41:11.600 --> 41:13.300]  once again, kind of pretzeled myself.
[41:13.460 --> 41:15.620]  So I like the idea of having
[41:15.620 --> 41:17.480]  the caviar phone where I
[41:17.480 --> 41:19.540]  feel like nobody's gonna see any of
[41:19.540 --> 41:21.060]  this, and
[41:21.060 --> 41:23.720]  it allows me to be as boring
[41:23.720 --> 41:25.560]  as I want without feeling any guilt
[41:25.560 --> 41:27.280]  about it. That's the
[41:27.800 --> 41:29.700]  strength of it. It sounds like you want
[41:29.700 --> 41:31.120]  to compete in the boring off.
[41:31.980 --> 41:33.660]  It would be up there. That would be
[41:33.660 --> 41:35.320]  my submission, for sure.
[41:37.000 --> 41:37.800]  It's mainly
[41:37.800 --> 41:39.900]  the idea of having a caviar phone.
[41:39.940 --> 41:41.760]  What if we all make caviar accounts
[41:41.760 --> 41:43.780]  and we all follow each other and we just
[41:43.780 --> 41:45.780]  have to out-bore each other? But you can't be
[41:45.780 --> 41:47.700]  boring on purpose. It has to be, like, genuine
[41:47.700 --> 41:48.240]  interest.
[41:49.580 --> 41:51.780]  Dude, I will bore the sh... Gavin, we
[41:51.780 --> 41:53.800]  have competition. I like this.
[41:55.040 --> 41:55.820]  I think
[41:55.820 --> 41:57.380]  it's just our text threads,
[41:57.380 --> 41:59.500]  is what you're describing. I think we
[41:59.500 --> 42:01.320]  naturally already do this.
[42:02.300 --> 42:03.380]  In terms of
[42:03.880 --> 42:05.120]  measuring against ourselves.
[42:05.600 --> 42:07.780]  I don't know. I just thought the caviar phone was funny,
[42:07.820 --> 42:09.600]  so I wanted to share that as an idea.
[42:09.960 --> 42:11.700]  Hey, uh, I think the
[42:11.700 --> 42:13.740]  caviar phone is an awesome idea, and I
[42:13.740 --> 42:15.740]  support it. And I think everybody should own a
[42:15.740 --> 42:17.460]  caviar phone. I think that
[42:17.460 --> 42:19.840]  should be the new thing. That should be what they're called.
[42:19.840 --> 42:22.120]  Instead of burner phones, caviar phones.
[42:22.360 --> 42:23.440]  Like, burner phones
[42:23.440 --> 42:25.980]  so you can, like, hire a hitman to
[42:25.980 --> 42:28.180]  kill your dad or your
[42:28.180 --> 42:30.000]  co-worker or your cousin or something.
[42:30.200 --> 42:31.900]  Or to buy drugs or whatever.
[42:32.260 --> 42:33.880]  Caviar phone is for
[42:33.880 --> 42:35.340]  not-so-hot sports takes.
[42:36.440 --> 42:37.860]  I, uh, I think we should
[42:38.540 --> 42:39.940]  get into selling burner
[42:39.940 --> 42:41.500]  phones, because we've already done the balaclava.
[42:41.740 --> 42:43.680]  If we next offered a caviar phone,
[42:44.560 --> 42:45.740]  what's the cheapest
[42:45.740 --> 42:48.740]  piece-of-shit phone? Probably, like, a
[42:48.740 --> 42:51.060]  fucking Mint Mobile or...
[42:51.060 --> 42:52.840]  Does 7-Eleven still sell phones?
[42:53.520 --> 42:54.800]  I feel like they would
[42:54.800 --> 42:56.680]  be up there. Yeah. For cheap burners.
[42:57.440 --> 42:58.940]  I just really... the idea
[42:58.940 --> 43:00.760]  of, like, the wire
[43:00.760 --> 43:02.820]  replacing the word burner
[43:02.820 --> 43:04.380]  with caviar in every
[43:04.380 --> 43:06.460]  mention of that show is so funny.
[43:10.040 --> 43:11.520]  If we're gonna sell caviar
[43:12.080 --> 43:14.400]  phones, I have another money
[43:14.400 --> 43:16.400]  making idea for us I wanted to present to you
[43:16.400 --> 43:17.520]  guys. Oh, good.
[43:18.580 --> 43:19.620]  Why did you say it like
[43:19.620 --> 43:19.900]  that?
[43:21.660 --> 43:23.080]  I thought that was enthused.
[43:23.520 --> 43:25.420]  I've been very critical of Gavin's delivery.
[43:25.560 --> 43:27.020]  I think that that was genuine interest.
[43:27.100 --> 43:29.760]  It didn't sound like...
[43:29.760 --> 43:31.260]  Am I... mm-mm. No.
[43:32.200 --> 43:33.080]  Uh, okay.
[43:33.340 --> 43:35.520]  Well, anyway, despite Gavin's lack of enthusiasm,
[43:36.740 --> 43:37.620]  uh, you
[43:37.620 --> 43:39.180]  know, my, my, uh,
[43:39.180 --> 43:41.480]  fiancé and her friend... well, my fiancé doesn't, but all
[43:41.480 --> 43:43.620]  of her friends read these Kindle, uh...
[43:43.620 --> 43:45.480]  Eric's small wife does, too. They read these
[43:45.480 --> 43:47.260]  Kindle sex books. Okay.
[43:47.560 --> 43:49.300]  And they're like, uh, they're just like
[43:49.300 --> 43:51.240]  Harlequin, like the new version of Harlequin
[43:51.240 --> 43:53.280]  Romances, but they're a little randier,
[43:53.300 --> 43:55.400]  I guess. And they all get
[43:55.400 --> 43:57.220]  them on this thing called Kindle Unlimited. I guess
[43:57.220 --> 43:59.360]  it's like a subscription you pay for on your
[43:59.360 --> 44:01.260]  Kindle and then you can read books for free.
[44:01.680 --> 44:03.340]  So I was like, how did those people
[44:03.340 --> 44:05.420]  get paid? And apparently
[44:05.420 --> 44:07.500]  the, the people who write books
[44:07.500 --> 44:09.540]  that are then up on Kindle
[44:09.540 --> 44:11.160]  Unlimited for people to read for free or
[44:11.160 --> 44:13.260]  via their monthly service, I guess they get
[44:13.260 --> 44:15.040]  paid by how many pages you read.
[44:15.620 --> 44:17.160]  So, like if you wrote a
[44:17.160 --> 44:19.260]  book and somebody, like a
[44:19.260 --> 44:21.140]  10,000 page book, and somebody read all
[44:21.140 --> 44:23.320]  10,000 pages, you'd get paid more than if you wrote
[44:23.320 --> 44:24.940]  a 200 page book. So you're thinking
[44:24.940 --> 44:27.320]  big font. Well, what I
[44:27.320 --> 44:28.100]  was thinking is,
[44:29.020 --> 44:31.520]  what if Andrew's 20,000
[44:31.520 --> 44:33.400]  things became a Kindle Unlimited book?
[44:34.260 --> 44:35.280]  It's just one per
[44:35.280 --> 44:35.720]  page.
[44:38.060 --> 44:39.200]  20,000 things,
[44:39.340 --> 44:41.320]  one per page, 20,000 page book.
[44:41.320 --> 44:42.660]  Boom. We just,
[44:43.000 --> 44:44.920]  we just beat the system.
[44:46.740 --> 44:47.260]  That
[44:47.260 --> 44:49.560]  could work. I'm not opposed to this idea.
[44:50.080 --> 44:50.900]  That's a big book.
[44:51.300 --> 44:52.920]  20,000 page book.
[44:53.420 --> 44:54.600]  Yeah, that's impressive.
[44:54.940 --> 44:57.320]  Can stuff that we've made up count
[44:57.320 --> 44:59.220]  as a thing? What do you mean?
[44:59.340 --> 45:01.400]  Why not? Like could Caviar Phone be a thing?
[45:02.000 --> 45:03.280]  Yeah. I think Caviar
[45:03.280 --> 45:05.180]  and Phone could in fact be two things.
[45:05.640 --> 45:07.180]  And then Caviar Phone could be a third thing.
[45:07.940 --> 45:08.460]  Absolutely.
[45:11.200 --> 45:11.720]  That's
[45:11.720 --> 45:12.760]  such a great idea, Geoff.
[45:13.240 --> 45:15.120]  It's like the infinite jest
[45:15.120 --> 45:17.000]  of just nonsense. Exactly.
[45:17.280 --> 45:18.280]  It's just way too big.
[45:18.960 --> 45:20.860]  You're the modern-day David Foster
[45:20.860 --> 45:21.120]  Wallace.
[45:24.920 --> 45:25.440]  He,
[45:25.640 --> 45:27.180]  I guarantee you, David Foster Wallace never
[45:27.180 --> 45:29.160]  gave any takes on Caviar Phones
[45:29.160 --> 45:29.780]  or
[45:30.860 --> 45:32.960]  Vin Diesel or
[45:33.740 --> 45:34.440]  what's another?
[45:34.640 --> 45:37.080]  Honey Mustard? Or Jackie Chan?
[45:37.560 --> 45:38.400]  I will
[45:39.080 --> 45:41.120]  say this. He did have a lot of
[45:41.120 --> 45:43.060]  boring, hot takes on tennis
[45:43.060 --> 45:45.100]  though. He did. Half of Infinite Jest
[45:45.100 --> 45:47.000]  is just boring fucking chapters
[45:47.000 --> 45:48.620]  of a dude going to tennis school.
[45:49.060 --> 45:50.920]  Stuff that should have been posted from the Caviar Phone?
[45:53.780 --> 45:55.180]  I'm so excited to get the
[45:55.180 --> 45:57.160]  Caviar Phone going. I can't wait.
[45:57.400 --> 45:59.300]  Maybe at the end of the hockey season
[45:59.300 --> 46:01.140]  I will share that account with you
[46:01.140 --> 46:02.360]  guys and you can just see
[46:02.980 --> 46:04.240]  the boring takes.
[46:05.480 --> 46:06.680]  I love it.
[46:06.980 --> 46:08.580]  What if we all do it?
[46:09.020 --> 46:10.320]  We'll be boring for like
[46:10.320 --> 46:12.160]  three months and then we'll give
[46:12.160 --> 46:13.860]  an independent judge
[46:13.860 --> 46:16.180]  the handles and they can just look through and see
[46:16.180 --> 46:17.500]  who is the most boring bastard.
[46:17.980 --> 46:19.540]  I like that idea.
[46:20.280 --> 46:22.520]  On top of that, I like the idea
[46:22.520 --> 46:24.560]  of you trying to determine
[46:24.560 --> 46:26.060]  because you're not going to follow this at all
[46:26.060 --> 46:28.240]  how well the Canucks did based
[46:28.240 --> 46:30.600]  off of my reading the feed.
[46:31.200 --> 46:32.440]  If you could accurately
[46:33.460 --> 46:33.980]  determine
[46:33.980 --> 46:35.980]  if they had a winning or losing season.
[46:36.280 --> 46:38.640]  You have to get the outcome from all the boredom.
[46:38.900 --> 46:39.260]  Yes.
[46:39.720 --> 46:42.060]  Because I will be complaining a lot about
[46:42.060 --> 46:43.600]  the fourth line left wing
[46:44.300 --> 46:46.300]  regardless of how well they're doing, most likely.
[46:46.780 --> 46:47.920]  They could be undefeated
[46:47.920 --> 46:50.220]  and I'd still be complaining about penalty minutes
[46:50.220 --> 46:51.760]  and shift rotation.
[46:52.040 --> 46:54.120]  Who's playing left wing in the fourth line?
[46:56.220 --> 46:57.840]  It's sort of like a weird thing where
[46:57.840 --> 47:00.320]  the bottom end depth of the team
[47:00.320 --> 47:01.400]  there's a lot there.
[47:01.540 --> 47:04.760]  We're overloaded with third liners.
[47:04.900 --> 47:06.420]  So maybe Hoglander
[47:06.420 --> 47:07.580]  could be there
[47:08.060 --> 47:09.580]  which is a great name.
[47:09.800 --> 47:11.060]  Yeah, that's a great name.
[47:12.440 --> 47:14.000]  Sounds like the boys spin-off.
[47:14.920 --> 47:15.360]  Hoglander?
[47:16.760 --> 47:17.640]  Niels Hoglander.
[47:17.720 --> 47:20.300]  That's like the Captain Carrot and his amazing zoo crew version
[47:20.300 --> 47:20.840]  of the boys.
[47:21.240 --> 47:24.260]  It's like everybody in the boys was a farm animal.
[47:24.920 --> 47:26.140]  I was very disappointed.
[47:26.320 --> 47:28.020]  There's a defenseman named Jet Wu
[47:28.020 --> 47:29.560]  and whenever he does something great
[47:29.560 --> 47:31.940]  everyone yells Wu but he hasn't worked out
[47:31.940 --> 47:32.740]  which is disappointing.
[47:32.940 --> 47:35.200]  I was excited about getting able to yell Wu.
[47:36.040 --> 47:37.280]  Every time he does something good
[47:37.280 --> 47:40.240]  they should play that Jet song by Paul McCartney
[47:40.240 --> 47:41.360]  because it literally goes
[47:41.360 --> 47:42.180]  Jet Wu!
[47:43.900 --> 47:45.980]  I'll let them know. I'll send them an email
[47:45.980 --> 47:47.260]  if Jet Wu ever makes it.
[47:47.500 --> 47:48.760]  I wonder if he was named after that.
[47:49.180 --> 47:49.720]  I have no idea.
[47:50.240 --> 47:53.400]  I've been trying out talking to myself
[47:54.920 --> 47:55.800]  because apparently
[47:56.380 --> 47:57.680]  everyone does it
[47:57.680 --> 47:58.980]  and it's normal
[47:59.700 --> 48:02.160]  but if I wasn't
[48:02.160 --> 48:03.940]  around anyone I would have spent
[48:03.940 --> 48:06.020]  35 years in total silence.
[48:06.480 --> 48:06.960]  Really?
[48:07.820 --> 48:09.840]  I just never say anything if no one's there.
[48:10.220 --> 48:11.780]  Like audibly or do you mean internally?
[48:12.400 --> 48:13.240]  Just out loud.
[48:13.440 --> 48:16.280]  I don't really think in sentences either.
[48:16.980 --> 48:17.240]  Really?
[48:17.680 --> 48:18.040]  I do.
[48:19.300 --> 48:21.760]  So you think like, oh that was a nice shit
[48:21.760 --> 48:23.480]  I'm going to go over here and load up stuff.
[48:23.480 --> 48:24.400]  You think like that?
[48:24.960 --> 48:27.520]  Maybe not that specific example
[48:27.520 --> 48:28.760]  but yes, in that structure.
[48:29.200 --> 48:31.060]  I took a nice shit earlier.
[48:31.940 --> 48:34.060]  So you had a little internal monologue about
[48:34.060 --> 48:35.360]  I said this is a nice shit.
[48:37.060 --> 48:39.540]  Listen, I was granted
[48:39.540 --> 48:41.200]  words when I was born
[48:41.200 --> 48:43.520]  well, I wasn't granted words, I was granted the ability
[48:43.520 --> 48:45.340]  to learn words when I was born and then I learned words
[48:45.340 --> 48:46.440]  I'm going to fucking use them.
[48:46.940 --> 48:49.880]  So what is going on in your head in a moment like that, Gavin?
[48:50.600 --> 48:51.460]  Is it just blank?
[48:51.460 --> 48:52.200]  Is it nothing?
[48:53.140 --> 48:55.140]  My head is more of like
[48:55.140 --> 48:57.780]  when you make one of the Sims do a bunch of shit
[48:57.780 --> 48:59.240]  and it just queues up as like
[48:59.240 --> 49:00.880]  imagery, I think.
[49:01.280 --> 49:03.600]  But there's no like monologue to it.
[49:03.680 --> 49:04.280]  There's no like
[49:04.280 --> 49:07.280]  and I've been trying to talk to myself
[49:07.280 --> 49:09.780]  and I don't know what to say.
[49:10.160 --> 49:10.900]  So if you
[49:10.900 --> 49:14.020]  say it's time to go to bed
[49:14.020 --> 49:14.380]  right?
[49:15.400 --> 49:15.980]  Do you just
[49:15.980 --> 49:18.860]  see a picture of your bed
[49:18.860 --> 49:19.800]  in your brain?
[49:21.060 --> 49:23.000]  Pretty much. I just like
[49:23.600 --> 49:24.740]  especially with something like that
[49:24.740 --> 49:27.160]  something that happens every day, I just autopilot
[49:27.160 --> 49:29.020]  in there. I think like, oh, I'm tired and then suddenly
[49:29.020 --> 49:29.780]  I'm just in the bed.
[49:30.120 --> 49:32.380]  That is an insane description.
[49:32.960 --> 49:34.760]  You stand up
[49:34.760 --> 49:37.000]  and then you're suddenly in the bed.
[49:38.160 --> 49:39.140]  Well, I don't think
[49:39.140 --> 49:40.520]  like, oh, better go to bed.
[49:40.660 --> 49:43.020]  I just end up there because I've gone tired.
[49:43.680 --> 49:44.300]  Oh, really?
[49:44.620 --> 49:46.680]  I've stood up and I've gone tired.
[49:46.680 --> 49:47.700]  I am in bed!
[49:50.360 --> 49:51.140]  I was just
[49:51.140 --> 49:52.860]  thinking earlier, like how all my perception
[49:52.860 --> 49:54.720]  is so warped, like not, having
[49:54.720 --> 49:56.920]  never driven a car, I'm always
[49:56.920 --> 49:58.960]  in someone's Uber and I'm never like
[49:58.960 --> 50:00.120]  looking out the window.
[50:01.060 --> 50:02.740]  So it's just like fast traveling.
[50:02.900 --> 50:05.020]  Like I don't know where anything is in relation
[50:05.020 --> 50:05.880]  to anything else.
[50:07.220 --> 50:08.280]  Why don't you look out the window?
[50:08.660 --> 50:10.700]  I mean, obviously you're looking at your phone, but why
[50:10.700 --> 50:12.420]  why don't you look at your window a little bit?
[50:13.420 --> 50:14.680]  Well, I mean, what am I looking at? The next
[50:14.680 --> 50:16.600]  car over? Here's what I'm looking at.
[50:16.700 --> 50:18.100]  Here's what I'm looking at if I'm looking out the window.
[50:18.360 --> 50:20.800]  I'm looking at the next car over and the person
[50:20.800 --> 50:22.900]  driving it always looks me in the eyes.
[50:24.180 --> 50:24.540]  Well...
[50:24.540 --> 50:26.020]  Why is that?
[50:26.340 --> 50:28.780]  Why is it that I can never just look at the side of someone's head?
[50:29.060 --> 50:30.880]  I'm either looking at someone texting
[50:30.880 --> 50:32.260]  while they're driving or
[50:32.260 --> 50:34.720]  they're driving and then just look at me. And it makes me think
[50:34.720 --> 50:36.800]  like, do the cars going by
[50:36.800 --> 50:38.660]  always look at me or is it just when I'm looking at them?
[50:39.960 --> 50:40.840]  Either way, I'm better
[50:40.840 --> 50:41.600]  off looking at my phone.
[50:41.600 --> 50:43.660]  I have so many questions, but then I
[50:43.660 --> 50:45.680]  need to constantly readjust under
[50:45.680 --> 50:47.720]  the, like, I am imagining this in the
[50:47.720 --> 50:49.560]  context of me and not the
[50:49.560 --> 50:51.660]  context of you who doesn't have thoughts
[50:51.660 --> 50:53.680]  and sentences. Well, I have thoughts,
[50:53.800 --> 50:55.640]  but they're not pictures.
[50:56.560 --> 50:57.580]  Yeah, they're images.
[50:58.540 --> 50:59.800]  He sees a picture
[50:59.800 --> 51:01.620]  He sees a picture
[51:01.620 --> 51:03.580]  of a bowl of fruity
[51:03.580 --> 51:05.560]  pebbles and milk and he just goes
[51:05.560 --> 51:07.500]  and he draws, he just
[51:07.500 --> 51:09.380]  makes what he sees in his mind.
[51:09.380 --> 51:11.460]  Like if I'm hungry,
[51:11.580 --> 51:13.100]  I'm like, oh, my tummy feels hungry.
[51:13.740 --> 51:15.520]  You just said, oh, my tummy feels hungry.
[51:15.900 --> 51:17.280]  Right, but that's how I'm
[51:17.280 --> 51:19.420]  wording it. But I'm not like, in the
[51:19.420 --> 51:21.600]  moment, like, ooh, hungry tummy.
[51:21.740 --> 51:22.900]  I'm just, I feel it.
[51:23.560 --> 51:25.600]  And then I'll go to the fridge
[51:25.600 --> 51:27.560]  or I'll look at my phone
[51:27.560 --> 51:29.520]  or something. So I'm just trying to wrap my head
[51:29.520 --> 51:31.580]  around this. So let's say if I'm
[51:31.580 --> 51:33.460]  looking out a car window and I'm
[51:33.460 --> 51:35.340]  not saying anything, I'm just looking. I might
[51:35.340 --> 51:37.540]  see a tree and I might, in my head, go like,
[51:37.540 --> 51:39.420]  oh, that's a nice shade of green. I
[51:39.420 --> 51:41.340]  wonder if I've seen that shade before.
[51:41.480 --> 51:43.500]  Does it maybe remind me of this? Does it look like a...
[51:43.500 --> 51:45.520]  Like, you don't do that? You don't have that
[51:45.520 --> 51:47.440]  in your head if you just saw a tree? You just
[51:47.440 --> 51:49.500]  think of a tree? I should definitely
[51:49.500 --> 51:51.600]  go down that thought path, but it wouldn't be...
[51:52.100 --> 51:53.720]  That's just not naturally what you would do.
[51:53.760 --> 51:55.300]  I wouldn't have thought that sentence.
[51:55.820 --> 51:57.460]  I, uh, you don't, like, play
[51:57.460 --> 51:59.400]  little games? Like, I make up games.
[51:59.580 --> 52:01.480]  Like, uh, oh, I saw a blue car. How many
[52:01.480 --> 52:03.700]  blue cars will I see before we exit the interstate?
[52:03.760 --> 52:05.520]  You don't do stuff like that? Well, I could
[52:05.520 --> 52:07.080]  do that. I just wouldn't, I wouldn't think,
[52:07.420 --> 52:09.280]  ooh, I wonder how many, you know, I wouldn't...
[52:09.280 --> 52:11.500]  It would just be... Thinking is so much
[52:11.500 --> 52:13.020]  quicker than speaking.
[52:13.500 --> 52:15.000]  I don't know, I talk pretty fast in my brain.
[52:15.720 --> 52:17.700]  Yeah, it's almost immediate, I feel like.
[52:17.940 --> 52:19.260]  But, like, like, for Andrew,
[52:19.400 --> 52:21.700]  for me, if, uh, if I'm
[52:21.700 --> 52:23.360]  hungry, right,
[52:23.420 --> 52:25.280]  I discover that I'm hungry, I
[52:25.280 --> 52:26.880]  would go, I'd be sitting down and I'd go,
[52:27.340 --> 52:29.580]  oh, look at that. I seem to be hungry. I'll get
[52:29.580 --> 52:31.420]  up and get some food. And I'll have that conversation
[52:31.420 --> 52:33.320]  in my head. I assume that it's the same for you because you're
[52:33.320 --> 52:35.480]  also a normal human? Yeah.
[52:35.940 --> 52:37.460]  That's exactly how it works. It might be
[52:37.460 --> 52:39.460]  a thing of, like, thinking
[52:39.460 --> 52:41.420]  about what I'm going to eat, do I want to do that, do I
[52:41.420 --> 52:43.640]  not want to do that, thinking about what's in the fridge.
[52:44.080 --> 52:45.320]  Maybe I'll even sing in my
[52:45.320 --> 52:47.480]  head on the way down. I feel like
[52:47.480 --> 52:49.740]  I, if I'm awake, I am in conversation.
[52:50.760 --> 52:51.300]  And you'll
[52:51.300 --> 52:53.200]  often do it out loud. Internally or externally?
[52:53.780 --> 52:55.140]  Oh, no, I go back and forth.
[52:55.560 --> 52:57.380]  I wouldn't say often, but I do sometimes. Do you try and
[52:57.380 --> 52:59.420]  talk out loud, like, do you talk
[52:59.420 --> 53:01.500]  to yourself mainly when no one's there, or do you still talk
[53:01.500 --> 53:02.740]  to yourself with people in the house?
[53:03.520 --> 53:05.400]  More common alone, but sometimes
[53:05.400 --> 53:07.480]  with people. I don't think it matters
[53:07.480 --> 53:08.460]  to me one way or the other.
[53:09.680 --> 53:11.560]  I've definitely been in a space where I've
[53:11.560 --> 53:13.500]  said something to myself, and someone said
[53:13.500 --> 53:15.440]  oh, what did you say? And then I
[53:15.440 --> 53:17.280]  reply, oh, don't worry, I was just talking to myself.
[53:17.740 --> 53:19.500]  Yeah, because I do that with Meg
[53:19.500 --> 53:20.880]  where she'll say something, and I'll
[53:21.520 --> 53:22.960]  be like, huh? And she's like, oh, nothing.
[53:23.220 --> 53:25.260]  But I've never done that.
[53:25.560 --> 53:26.840]  So when did you start doing this?
[53:27.120 --> 53:28.760]  What, practicing talking to myself? Yeah.
[53:28.760 --> 53:30.740]  How far into it are you? This week.
[53:31.040 --> 53:32.660]  Have you noticed any positive
[53:32.660 --> 53:35.060]  or negatives from it? Like, what is your goal with this project?
[53:35.440 --> 53:36.900]  Well, I don't know, because it doesn't
[53:36.900 --> 53:38.820]  come naturally to me. I have to think
[53:38.820 --> 53:40.880]  first about what I'm going to say to myself.
[53:41.260 --> 53:41.980]  So it doesn't make sense.
[53:42.900 --> 53:45.240]  Like, earlier, I was
[53:45.240 --> 53:46.840]  walking upstairs, and I
[53:46.840 --> 53:48.800]  was like, ooh, I wonder where
[53:48.800 --> 53:50.840]  I'll go in Starfield. And I said
[53:50.840 --> 53:52.660]  that out loud, and I just thought, well, that's
[53:53.020 --> 53:54.340]  I don't know what that's done for me.
[53:54.860 --> 53:56.520]  I don't know what that offers
[53:56.520 --> 53:58.620]  that I didn't already... like, I could have thought that.
[53:59.040 --> 54:00.560]  Yeah. I don't think
[54:00.560 --> 54:02.520]  there's a right or wrong way. It's just interesting.
[54:03.180 --> 54:04.340]  Yeah, it is interesting.
[54:04.980 --> 54:06.340]  Because I would say, for me, on the inside,
[54:06.480 --> 54:08.560]  it's more like, you know how we used to always joke
[54:08.560 --> 54:10.540]  our friend Michael, who's very talented at talking
[54:10.540 --> 54:12.180]  and really good at filling space,
[54:12.520 --> 54:14.680]  and how we used to always say that you could just put him in front of a mirror
[54:14.680 --> 54:16.540]  for five or six hours and just let him go, and he
[54:16.540 --> 54:18.060]  would just talk and fill that space?
[54:18.680 --> 54:20.000]  It's like that on the inside
[54:20.700 --> 54:22.400]  all the time. It's just if you
[54:22.400 --> 54:23.560]  open your mouth door or not.
[54:27.840 --> 54:28.600]  I wonder...
[54:29.140 --> 54:30.460]  I wonder if it has anything
[54:30.460 --> 54:31.480]  to do with having siblings.
[54:32.400 --> 54:32.780]  Oh.
[54:32.800 --> 54:34.620]  Because you and I are both only kids, right, Geoff?
[54:34.780 --> 54:36.020]  And Gavin had siblings.
[54:36.280 --> 54:38.560]  So I wonder if that has in any way
[54:39.200 --> 54:39.940]  shifted that.
[54:40.940 --> 54:42.960]  Yeah, do you think this has anything to do with you
[54:42.960 --> 54:44.680]  being the least popular of your siblings?
[54:48.960 --> 54:50.620]  But that, I would have thought,
[54:50.660 --> 54:52.180]  would make me want to talk to myself more.
[54:52.180 --> 54:53.360]  Oh, that's a good point.
[54:53.960 --> 54:56.620]  See, from my perspective, it would be...
[54:56.620 --> 54:58.160]  Okay, well, Gracie's just
[54:58.160 --> 54:59.560]  shooting this theory to
[55:00.120 --> 55:00.640]  smithereens.
[55:01.260 --> 55:02.720]  Oh, there you go.
[55:03.620 --> 55:06.040]  I mean, what Gavin is describing is how
[55:06.040 --> 55:07.600]  wolves exist.
[55:07.980 --> 55:10.180]  So, like, he's just simply like...
[55:11.340 --> 55:12.340]  Yeah, he's just
[55:12.340 --> 55:14.120]  purely on instinct where he stands
[55:14.120 --> 55:15.820]  up and go bed. Like,
[55:15.980 --> 55:17.480]  it is...
[55:18.440 --> 55:20.180]  That's how a wolf operates.
[55:20.640 --> 55:22.240]  So, I don't really...
[55:22.240 --> 55:22.560]  Wolf tire.
[55:23.040 --> 55:26.220]  The only time they talk is to other wolves, and that's howling at the moon.
[55:26.380 --> 55:27.560]  So, I mean, that...
[55:29.680 --> 55:31.740]  So I could be like the wolf guy?
[55:31.920 --> 55:33.520]  Yeah, that's what I would say.
[55:33.660 --> 55:34.740]  You're like the wolf guy.
[55:36.120 --> 55:38.100]  I'm like the wolf of the group, you're the rat.
[55:40.740 --> 55:41.540]  Andrew's the...
[55:42.020 --> 55:43.100]  That made me light-headed.
[55:43.100 --> 55:44.180]  That was very funny.
[55:48.340 --> 55:51.220]  You're like the wolf. You're like the rat.
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.280]  I'm trying to get better at it, because I feel like
[55:56.280 --> 55:58.340]  I don't really that often struggle
[55:58.340 --> 56:00.420]  to come up with conversation in real
[56:00.420 --> 56:01.640]  life with other people, but
[56:02.500 --> 56:04.480]  I've gotten myself into some real awkward
[56:04.480 --> 56:04.860]  silences.
[56:07.940 --> 56:10.420]  That's because you don't know how to talk to you.
[56:10.580 --> 56:12.400]  You've been ignoring you your entire
[56:12.400 --> 56:14.420]  life, man. You really should get to know Gavin.
[56:14.420 --> 56:16.280]  We love him. We've been fans
[56:16.280 --> 56:16.900]  for a long time.
[56:19.740 --> 56:21.680]  So do you not ever...
[56:21.680 --> 56:23.880]  So you don't ever...
[56:23.880 --> 56:25.880]  That's interesting. You don't ever have
[56:25.880 --> 56:27.940]  little moments of self-realization
[56:27.940 --> 56:30.200]  where you're talking through something in your head
[56:30.200 --> 56:30.660]  and then you
[56:32.440 --> 56:33.340]  rationalize something and you go,
[56:33.480 --> 56:36.060]  I was looking at it wrong, or I hadn't thought of it that way.
[56:36.340 --> 56:37.860]  You don't ever have those internal
[56:38.340 --> 56:39.540]  conversations where you work shit out.
[56:39.700 --> 56:42.520]  That's wild. That is scary to me, Gavin.
[56:42.520 --> 56:44.540]  It's happening. It's just not
[56:44.540 --> 56:45.200]  in words.
[56:46.800 --> 56:47.240]  Yeah.
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.460]  I think it's okay. I don't think
[56:50.460 --> 56:52.380]  you necessarily need to become good at this.
[56:52.460 --> 56:54.460]  It doesn't seem like it's been an issue
[56:54.460 --> 56:56.680]  for you in any way. Well, I've always been
[56:56.680 --> 56:58.400]  dog shit at explaining stuff.
[56:58.640 --> 57:00.680]  And I think it's because I'm on the fly converting
[57:00.680 --> 57:02.200]  images into words that I've
[57:02.200 --> 57:04.020]  never thought of the sentences.
[57:08.270 --> 57:09.270]  I would really
[57:09.270 --> 57:11.170]  like for you to describe
[57:11.170 --> 57:13.290]  something to me the way that you imagine
[57:13.290 --> 57:15.070]  it in your head. I'd like to see
[57:15.070 --> 57:17.170]  the image translation.
[57:18.070 --> 57:19.370]  I've realized the only
[57:19.370 --> 57:21.550]  time I actually do say stuff out loud alone
[57:22.030 --> 57:23.210]  is when I'm editing
[57:23.210 --> 57:25.450]  and my Mac pinwheels and I'll often
[57:25.450 --> 57:27.150]  just scream prick
[57:27.150 --> 57:29.150]  or something just at my computer.
[57:29.750 --> 57:31.430]  That's about it. That's about as far as it goes.
[57:32.230 --> 57:33.570]  Did you ever...
[57:34.170 --> 57:35.070]  When I was
[57:35.070 --> 57:37.170]  really young, when I was probably like
[57:37.170 --> 57:39.330]  five or six, old
[57:39.330 --> 57:41.310]  Windows computer, whenever it
[57:41.310 --> 57:43.530]  would stall when I was trying to play a game,
[57:43.790 --> 57:45.210]  I would threaten it
[57:45.210 --> 57:47.230]  because I thought that would make it load faster.
[57:47.710 --> 57:49.470]  You'd like front on it, you'd square up
[57:49.470 --> 57:51.270]  to it. Yeah, I'd be like, listen,
[57:51.510 --> 57:53.390]  if we don't get through this load screen, if you
[57:53.390 --> 57:55.250]  crash again, I'm throwing you in the bathtub.
[57:56.210 --> 57:57.590]  You're going right in the tub.
[57:58.630 --> 57:59.350]  You and me,
[57:59.430 --> 58:01.170]  it's over. You're getting water all over you.
[58:02.410 --> 58:03.430]  I'm just trying to play
[58:03.430 --> 58:05.770]  Settlers 2 or Spy Fox
[58:05.770 --> 58:06.670]  and Dry Cereal.
[58:07.090 --> 58:09.270]  Not even yelling, calmly being like,
[58:09.270 --> 58:11.230]  listen, I'm not excited about this, but
[58:11.230 --> 58:12.510]  if you fail again,
[58:13.410 --> 58:14.970]  I'm dumping you in water.
[58:15.530 --> 58:17.050]  Yeah, this is, it's over.
[58:17.110 --> 58:18.750]  It's on you at this point. Yeah.
[58:19.050 --> 58:21.430]  I gotta put you down. I'm just imagining
[58:21.430 --> 58:23.250]  Kurt Russell dumping his
[58:23.250 --> 58:24.470]  whiskey in the
[58:24.470 --> 58:25.170]  chest.
[58:25.170 --> 58:29.150]  Yeah, that's great. That's you,
[58:29.490 --> 58:30.810]  Kevin. That's you.
[58:33.270 --> 58:33.790]  Goddamn.
[58:35.950 --> 58:37.170]  Well, listen,
[58:37.170 --> 58:39.110]  as a big fan of
[58:39.110 --> 58:41.150]  Gavin for a long time, and
[58:41.150 --> 58:43.190]  someone who thoroughly enjoys conversations
[58:43.190 --> 58:44.990]  with him, I hope you get to know him
[58:44.990 --> 58:46.790]  better, Gav, because
[58:47.270 --> 58:48.930]  he really does have a lot to offer.
[58:49.170 --> 58:51.170]  We're working on it, for sure. Alright, that's good.
[58:51.790 --> 58:53.010]  Hey, let me ask you guys a question.
[58:53.650 --> 58:55.170]  What do you refer to the inside
[58:55.170 --> 58:57.110]  of a battery as? I don't
[58:57.110 --> 58:59.110]  think I ever have... Like battery acid?
[58:59.570 --> 59:00.590]  Yeah, I guess.
[59:00.970 --> 59:03.430]  I was reading an article the other day on
[59:03.430 --> 59:04.930]  battery technology
[59:04.930 --> 59:06.590]  and improvements on
[59:06.590 --> 59:08.910]  batteries and how they're built, and
[59:08.910 --> 59:10.730]  they kept referring to the insides of batteries
[59:10.730 --> 59:12.970]  as the battery ingredients, and that just
[59:12.970 --> 59:14.410]  seemed really weird to me.
[59:14.890 --> 59:16.830]  I guess they're different, aren't they? Like lithium, or
[59:17.410 --> 59:19.110]  lead acid, or...
[59:19.110 --> 59:21.110]  I guess I only think of ingredients
[59:21.870 --> 59:22.850]  when it relates to
[59:22.850 --> 59:24.990]  food or drink, usually. I don't think of batteries
[59:24.990 --> 59:26.730]  as having ingredients, but I guess
[59:26.730 --> 59:29.010]  technically they do. It just really stuck out to me.
[59:29.070 --> 59:30.390]  It's been bugging me.
[59:30.990 --> 59:32.670]  Yeah, you wouldn't
[59:33.410 --> 59:34.810]  You wouldn't, like, talk about
[59:34.810 --> 59:36.590]  a Billy bookcase from Ikea
[59:36.590 --> 59:38.670]  as, like, all the ingredients. Right.
[59:39.130 --> 59:40.010]  So why a battery?
[59:41.330 --> 59:42.610]  I never even
[59:42.610 --> 59:44.610]  really thought about there actually being an
[59:44.610 --> 59:46.870]  explanation for buzzwords
[59:46.870 --> 59:48.770]  on batteries. I viewed it in the
[59:48.770 --> 59:50.670]  same way as, like, Mountain Dew. Like
[59:50.670 --> 59:52.610]  if I... Duracell lithium is
[59:52.610 --> 59:54.630]  no different in my head than Mountain Dew code
[59:54.630 --> 59:56.170]  red. Like, it just is
[59:56.690 --> 59:58.610]  exciting words that follow the product.
[59:58.850 --> 59:59.950]  I see. I see.
[01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.070]  I've put very little thought
[01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:04.030]  into batteries. Outside of...
[01:00:04.030 --> 01:00:05.850]  I don't... Have you seen those batteries
[01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:08.130]  where, like, you can squeeze it and it tells you
[01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:10.090]  how much battery? I don't trust
[01:00:10.090 --> 01:00:11.890]  that. I don't believe that's real. I think
[01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:13.990]  that's... They don't really... I think that's kind of
[01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:15.670]  dead, right? Yeah, that's like... Like, you don't really see...
[01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:17.010]  25 year old tech, I think.
[01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:19.690]  Yeah, I don't... Well, I feel like it
[01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:21.610]  had, like, resurgence in, like, 2018
[01:00:21.610 --> 01:00:23.910]  and I've seen them a lot and I was like, I don't trust this.
[01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:26.210]  Would you consider your bones
[01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:27.870]  and organs to be
[01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:29.450]  Gavin's ingredients?
[01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:33.870]  I'd consider them to be wetware, is
[01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:36.170]  I think what I'd consider them. Yeah, that's a wetware.
[01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:38.150]  That's a wetware. I feel like ingredients
[01:00:38.650 --> 01:00:39.750]  is only ingredients
[01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:41.310]  when you have to combine them first.
[01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:44.010]  Like, you can't smash
[01:00:44.010 --> 01:00:45.890]  open a dog and say, look at all the
[01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:47.290]  ingredients. Like, it came that way.
[01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:49.830]  I don't know why you went with dog.
[01:00:50.070 --> 01:00:52.210]  I don't know. Why do you...
[01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:53.410]  You hate dogs? But, would you
[01:00:53.410 --> 01:00:55.710]  not say that the inside of a
[01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:57.050]  watermelon is its ingredients?
[01:00:57.370 --> 01:00:59.630]  Thank you, Geoff. No, I wouldn't. Gavin,
[01:00:59.730 --> 01:01:01.530]  go back to talking to yourself, please. I
[01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:03.550]  didn't think there was a problem. There might be a bigger
[01:01:03.550 --> 01:01:05.390]  problem than I realized. Yeah, don't say anything like that out loud.
[01:01:05.790 --> 01:01:07.890]  Don't walk around and say, what are the ingredients
[01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:09.330]  of Smee? And then
[01:01:09.330 --> 01:01:11.110]  it's not... it's not good.
[01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:13.690]  I think they're only
[01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:15.510]  ingredients if you had to collect
[01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:17.710]  and combine them. I don't feel like
[01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:19.010]  what about when you're making a recipe?
[01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:21.670]  There's an ingredient list. Right.
[01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:23.610]  And what are you doing with them? You're gonna
[01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:25.190]  combine them, but I thought...
[01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:26.830]  Well, so,
[01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:29.670]  aren't you just
[01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:31.550]  your... just the ingredients
[01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:33.610]  of your mom and your dad?
[01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:35.850]  Like, your dad deposited ingredients
[01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:36.430]  into your mom.
[01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:38.550]  Jesus Christ.
[01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:41.670]  That's fucking science,
[01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:43.030]  man! Come on!
[01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:45.790]  That recipe will not be in the cookbook.
[01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:48.890]  Jesus Christ. Ingredients
[01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:49.810]  are any part...
[01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:51.390]  any of the food or substances
[01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:53.110]  that are combined to make a particular
[01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:55.070]  dish. If that dish is Gavin,
[01:01:55.350 --> 01:01:57.170]  then this applies. If the dish is a battery,
[01:01:57.310 --> 01:01:58.790]  I guess it still applies.
[01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:03.390]  I feel like you just took us on a road
[01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:05.370]  for you to say that. That it was all
[01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:07.290]  for that. No, I just came up with that
[01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:07.810]  in the moment.
[01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:12.390]  Oh, God.
[01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:14.970]  There's gotta be...
[01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:16.870]  Yeah, I think...
[01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:18.870]  It's not ingredients if it starts that way.
[01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:20.930]  Okay. Well, I'm not sure how I feel about it,
[01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:22.850]  but I'm gonna have a conversation
[01:02:22.850 --> 01:02:24.250]  with myself off-air
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.330]  and see if I can get to the bottom of it.
[01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:29.070]  I might try and record
[01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:30.130]  myself talking to myself.
[01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:32.490]  Dude, you should. You absolutely should.
[01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:33.410]  That would be awesome.
[01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:36.950]  I feel like I'm on a first
[01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:37.290]  date.
[01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:43.010]  Like, have you never
[01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:44.890]  had a conversation in your head and then
[01:02:44.890 --> 01:02:47.170]  disappointed yourself? I do that all the time.
[01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:49.250]  Like, why did I
[01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:50.750]  say that? Or why did I think that?
[01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:53.070]  Oh, you're better than that, Geoff. Come on.
[01:02:53.530 --> 01:02:55.310]  Like, I'm
[01:02:55.310 --> 01:02:57.210]  always disappointed in my own
[01:02:57.210 --> 01:02:58.350]  conversation with myself.
[01:02:59.350 --> 01:03:01.230]  You also provide
[01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:02.810]  yourself with the immediate feedback.
[01:03:03.370 --> 01:03:05.130]  Like, if you say something that you don't like,
[01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:07.130]  you'll just be... you'll follow up with like...
[01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:08.710]  Yeah.
[01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:11.290]  I will sometimes
[01:03:11.290 --> 01:03:13.090]  if I say something that I'm like,
[01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:15.010]  that was a really dumb thing to say
[01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:17.010]  internally, I will
[01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:19.430]  then turn it into I'm doing a character
[01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:21.070]  audibly. So it wasn't
[01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:23.030]  me. So I could disown that that was
[01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:24.770]  a thing I said.
[01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:26.790]  That's how Johnny Caviar was born, right?
[01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:28.770]  Essentially, yes.
[01:03:30.610 --> 01:03:33.130]  Well, we don't have all the ingredients for Johnny Caviar.
[01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:34.870]  Still working on it.
[01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:36.190]  Still figuring it out.
[01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:39.090]  Have you guys ever done that thing where you're at a...
[01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:41.130]  let's say a convenience store, like the one right by
[01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:42.610]  my house, for instance, last Friday night.
[01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:44.530]  And you go in to buy some
[01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:46.630]  potato chips, but you don't really know what kind of potato chips
[01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:48.410]  you want. But you know you want something kind of salty,
[01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:50.590]  so you go in to get potato chips. And then you're looking
[01:03:50.590 --> 01:03:52.410]  at all the potato chips, and you realize that
[01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:54.670]  nothing looks better than anything
[01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:56.590]  else. Nothing looks better or
[01:03:56.590 --> 01:03:58.470]  worse than every flavor and
[01:03:58.470 --> 01:04:00.290]  every style and every
[01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.870]  parameter around
[01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:04.670]  a potato chip or a
[01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:05.590]  corn chip is
[01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:08.470]  exactly the fucking same.
[01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:10.610]  And you're standing there and you're like,
[01:04:10.610 --> 01:04:12.510]  there is no goddamn difference between
[01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:14.210]  a Frito and a Dorito anyway.
[01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:16.530]  So which one do I pick? And then you realize
[01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:18.330]  you have been standing
[01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:20.450]  in a convenience store looking at potato chips for
[01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:22.130]  like 15 straight minutes.
[01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:24.510]  And it is way, way, way too
[01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:26.470]  long. And it is noticeable
[01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:28.670]  and people are noticing that you're standing there
[01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:30.490]  staring at the potato chips because it's
[01:04:30.490 --> 01:04:32.530]  been at such an inordinate amount of time. So you just
[01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:34.530]  grab the first three bags of potato chips you
[01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:36.510]  see and buy them to get the fuck out of there
[01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:38.330]  and then end up with nothing that you wanted.
[01:04:38.330 --> 01:04:40.290]  That's a factor of the bland
[01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:42.270]  ass American selection. I would say
[01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:44.410]  if you're looking at Transformer snacks, Twiglets
[01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:46.170]  and Frazzles, it's
[01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:47.490]  such a different variety.
[01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:50.090]  I think your eyes would light up. I mean,
[01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:52.230]  you just described a bunch of shit I would never put
[01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:53.450]  in my mouth again.
[01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:56.410]  I still think about how bad Twiglets are.
[01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:58.270]  Why don't you shove it up
[01:04:58.270 --> 01:04:59.330]  your ass, alright?
[01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:02.410]  It would be more enjoyable
[01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:03.750]  than it being in my mouth.
[01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:06.130]  I would rather. Can't taste worse?
[01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:06.850]  Op for that.
[01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:09.970]  Is that out yet? Yeah, that comes out the week
[01:05:09.970 --> 01:05:12.090]  we're recording this, yeah, so it's out. Okay, good.
[01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:14.050]  I got an enema
[01:05:14.050 --> 01:05:15.990]  the other day. This is the end of the episode.
[01:05:16.110 --> 01:05:18.230]  What the fuck is going on? That's the craziest
[01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:20.030]  way that we could... What happened?
[01:05:20.590 --> 01:05:22.110]  I mean, if anything's gonna
[01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:24.030]  trump the end of an episode, it's butt news. It's
[01:05:24.030 --> 01:05:25.350]  enema news. What's the latest?
[01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:28.110]  Not like an intentional enema,
[01:05:28.530 --> 01:05:30.190]  but I went to Schlitterbahn
[01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:31.950]  last weekend.
[01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:34.130]  It was the last day it was open and I
[01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:36.070]  hadn't been in like 14 years.
[01:05:36.210 --> 01:05:37.890]  I think since Millie was like 4 or 5.
[01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:39.770]  I've been king once. It's the last time I went.
[01:05:40.610 --> 01:05:42.090]  And I rode on this ride
[01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:44.150]  called the Master Blaster. I'd never ridden on it
[01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:46.330]  before because the line is always too long.
[01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:47.910]  And I think it's like...
[01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:50.170]  I think it was the first uphill
[01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:51.690]  water slide, like,
[01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:53.250]  in the world. Oh, no.
[01:05:53.890 --> 01:05:56.030]  And I never really thought about how that works or what
[01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:58.190]  that meant, but I... because it was the last
[01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:59.770]  day it was open, there was never a line,
[01:05:59.970 --> 01:06:02.070]  so out of all the times I've been to Schlitterbahn, I've never
[01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:04.030]  ridden on one of the fancy rides because I refuse
[01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:06.290]  to stand in line for more than 30 minutes for anything.
[01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:07.610]  I'm just not gonna do it.
[01:06:07.850 --> 01:06:10.130]  And those lines are like fucking 3 hours long in the summer.
[01:06:10.310 --> 01:06:12.070]  You go to Schlitterbahn, you ride
[01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:14.070]  2 90 second rides and your
[01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:15.990]  entire day is over. The rest of it, you spent
[01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:18.070]  7 hours in lines trying to get there. Like, that's just
[01:06:18.070 --> 01:06:20.070]  fucking stupid. That's a stupid way to
[01:06:20.070 --> 01:06:20.910]  spend money in a day.
[01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:23.650]  So, it was pretty empty
[01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:25.930]  because it was the last day and so I went up and I
[01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:27.810]  rode on this Master Blaster ride with Emily
[01:06:27.810 --> 01:06:30.010]  and the first thing it does
[01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:31.170]  is shoot you uphill
[01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:33.950]  and the way it does that is by shooting about
[01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:36.110]  75 liters of water
[01:06:36.110 --> 01:06:37.490]  straight up your asshole.
[01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:40.150]  The ride immediately pulled my pants down
[01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:42.230]  and immediately injected water up my butt
[01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:43.430]  and I was like, oh!
[01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:45.850]  And then you go down and then you go up again
[01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:47.830]  and like 6 separate times on that ride
[01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:49.670]  I got injected with water.
[01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:51.890]  Like a high
[01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:53.850]  colonic of the highest order. It was
[01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:56.270]  insane. How does it pull the pants down but shoot the water up?
[01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:57.950]  I don't know, dude.
[01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:59.190]  It like pushes them away.
[01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:01.030]  It like pushes them up your legs.
[01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:04.050]  Cause the water's like going forward
[01:07:04.050 --> 01:07:05.590]  and so you're laying down
[01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:08.190]  and it just like pushes in between your shorts
[01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:09.990]  and like your waistline
[01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:11.290]  and it just shoots your shorts up
[01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:13.150]  and then just right up your asshole.
[01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:15.670]  I don't understand the physics of this.
[01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:16.730]  I need a diagram.
[01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:19.810]  Well, I'll take you. When they open up in the spring, I'll take you
[01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:20.910]  and you can see what I mean.
[01:07:21.330 --> 01:07:22.670]  I went with you before once, didn't I?
[01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:24.950]  Like 20 years ago. It was so long ago.
[01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:26.930]  Was that the time that we got you to eat that pepper?
[01:07:27.690 --> 01:07:29.230]  Me and Jason and Gus.
[01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:30.810]  Yeah, I almost
[01:07:31.310 --> 01:07:31.690]  died.
[01:07:32.370 --> 01:07:33.990]  That was probably 15 years ago.
[01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:36.190]  That was still the spiciest thing I've ever eaten.
[01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:38.270]  Wasn't it just like a jalapeno?
[01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:40.870]  We told you it was a
[01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:42.530]  jalapeno, I think, but it was a serrano.
[01:07:43.130 --> 01:07:43.170]  Maybe.
[01:07:44.070 --> 01:07:45.510]  I think that might have been what it was.
[01:07:45.970 --> 01:07:49.270]  Like you were pepper dumb and so we tricked you.
[01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:53.110]  Or maybe it was just a really
[01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:53.830]  hot jalapeno.
[01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:56.690]  I remember you having a real tough time with it.
[01:07:57.110 --> 01:07:58.330]  Wasn't Becca there too?
[01:07:59.310 --> 01:07:59.910]  She might have been.
[01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:01.890]  She might have been.
[01:08:02.130 --> 01:08:04.110]  I remember Jason specifically being there.
[01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:06.570]  I remember Jason almost falling over laughing.
[01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:08.350]  That's really the only thing.
[01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:10.430]  I remember we were all exhausted from being either
[01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:12.670]  Tuban or at Schlitterbahn and we stopped
[01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:14.910]  at a barbecue restaurant on the way
[01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:15.170]  home.
[01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:19.010]  I feel like my earlier times
[01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:19.870]  in Texas
[01:08:20.750 --> 01:08:21.990]  it was just so
[01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:24.070]  overwhelming and scary.
[01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:26.230]  Just being in America in general
[01:08:26.230 --> 01:08:27.090]  to me was so new.
[01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:30.470]  I'd always try and keep such a low profile
[01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:31.870]  and never draw any attention to myself.
[01:08:32.290 --> 01:08:33.870]  And then I ate that and I was just
[01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:35.790]  rolling around on the floor in public.
[01:08:36.130 --> 01:08:36.770]  In the dust.
[01:08:38.290 --> 01:08:39.170]  Just like...
[01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:46.230]  Can we get those noises isolated
[01:08:46.230 --> 01:08:46.610]  for me?
[01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:48.430]  I'll leave those for the break show later.
[01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:49.590]  Nick, thank you.
[01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:51.750]  Shit!
[01:08:52.530 --> 01:08:53.950]  Can we get that isolated as well?
[01:08:54.090 --> 01:08:56.070]  That was a good one. That was great. That was clean.
[01:08:56.410 --> 01:08:58.510]  I've been making and giving them to Mike Purtle
[01:08:58.510 --> 01:09:00.970]  and he's been putting them on the soundboard so I want to keep adding them in.
[01:09:01.450 --> 01:09:01.990]  Ah, that's great.
[01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:04.730]  Well, should we fucking end
[01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:06.850]  this thing? Hey, so Let's Play launches
[01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:08.350]  this week where we're taking it over
[01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:10.650]  and we're going to be putting up videos on the Let's Play
[01:09:10.650 --> 01:09:11.950]  channel. That's pretty exciting.
[01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:14.510]  It happens the week that this airs?
[01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:15.990]  Yes. Wow.
[01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:17.190]  What week does this air?
[01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:19.170]  Uh, 10... Jesus.
[01:09:19.670 --> 01:09:22.310]  In, what, two weeks or something? Like 10-4?
[01:09:22.570 --> 01:09:24.650]  So, Friday the 6th will be
[01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:26.250]  our first Let's Play video
[01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:28.270]  on the Let's Play channel
[01:09:28.270 --> 01:09:30.450]  on YouTube and then Monday the 9th
[01:09:30.450 --> 01:09:32.870]  will be our first episode of F*** Faceoff
[01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:34.350]  that will be on Rooster Teeth First.
[01:09:34.790 --> 01:09:36.830]  Let's not call them Let's Play
[01:09:36.830 --> 01:09:38.290]  videos. Let's call them
[01:09:38.290 --> 01:09:40.310]  regulation gameplay videos.
[01:09:40.330 --> 01:09:41.270]  Okay, regulation...
[01:09:41.270 --> 01:09:42.590]  Okay, well our first
[01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:45.250]  regulation gameplay on the
[01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:47.350]  Let's Play channel will be up on
[01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:49.330]  10-6. Uh, you can check it
[01:09:49.330 --> 01:09:49.630]  out there.
[01:09:51.130 --> 01:09:53.950]  Nick's very excited. You can go to f***facepod.com
[01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:55.290]  slash first and you can sign
[01:09:55.290 --> 01:09:57.330]  up and that supports us directly. Just a heads up
[01:09:57.330 --> 01:09:59.110]  if you're looking to do that, to check out
[01:09:59.110 --> 01:10:01.230]  f***faceoff. Keep, uh, keep
[01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:03.510]  your eyes peeled for Andrew's 20,000
[01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:05.330]  things coming to, uh, Kindle
[01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:07.470]  Unlimited. It's gonna be spicy.
[01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:09.510]  It's gonna be spicy, spicy
[01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:11.210]  sexy book. Does it need to be spicy?
[01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:13.490]  Wouldn't hurt. Okay. Wouldn't hurt if you threw
[01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:15.610]  a couple, you know, all 20,000 things
[01:10:15.610 --> 01:10:17.630]  don't have to be spicy, but if you wanted to throw five or six
[01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:19.370]  spicy ones in there, I'm sure, uh,
[01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:21.570]  I'm sure, uh, all
[01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:23.470]  of the ladies that are reading, or just
[01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:25.890]  all the people that are reading book talk would probably appreciate it.
[01:10:26.130 --> 01:10:27.570]  How many pages do you think
[01:10:27.570 --> 01:10:29.470]  it would take to, for you to get
[01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:30.330]  someone wet?
[01:10:32.050 --> 01:10:33.530]  Um, this is...
[01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:33.830]  What?
[01:10:35.650 --> 01:10:37.430]  And you thought I was
[01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:38.090]  being inappropriate.
[01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:41.470]  Uh, I could, uh,
[01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:43.610]  uh,
[01:10:43.650 --> 01:10:45.490]  I don't want to answer this, but I feel like I shouldn't.
[01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:47.430]  Uh, thanks for
[01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:48.670]  listening. We'll see you next week.
[01:10:51.610 --> 01:10:52.090]  Why?
[01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:54.530]  What do you mean why?
[01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:57.550]  That is so ridiculous.
[01:10:59.050 --> 01:10:59.770]  Hey guys,
[01:11:00.250 --> 01:11:01.330]  MajorLeagueFanJack here with a look at
[01:11:01.330 --> 01:11:03.310]  next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:11:03.570 --> 01:11:05.010]  Who doesn't know how to use their phone?
[01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:06.790]  It's the Caviar Collection.
[01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:08.850]  Let's break some sparkle surprises.
[01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:10.490]  Alien Babies.
[01:11:10.810 --> 01:11:12.190]  Patton breaks the Discord website.
[01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:14.750]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:17.230]  All that and more on next week's episode of
[01:11:17.230 --> 01:11:17.790]  F*** Face.
