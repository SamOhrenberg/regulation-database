[00:09.760 --> 00:10.680]  I
[00:14.750 --> 00:20.060]  Was just enjoying the pleasantries. Sounds like pleasantries were a little heated.
[00:20.100 --> 00:22.560]  You were just about to introduce it.
[00:22.880 --> 00:23.460]  Sorry.
[00:24.750 --> 00:26.240]  We were just talking about basketball.
[00:27.120 --> 00:28.000]  Hello and welcome...
[00:28.790 --> 00:30.860]  Hey Gavin, you take it this time.
[00:31.700 --> 00:32.940]  Hiya, take it away Geoff.
[00:33.880 --> 00:38.000]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:38.660 --> 00:41.220]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me as always, Andrew Panton.
[00:41.580 --> 00:43.260]  Way up there in Canada.
[00:43.620 --> 00:44.860]  And then...
[00:44.860 --> 00:46.180]  Gavin Free.
[00:46.700 --> 00:49.280]  Way over there about 5 miles away from you right now.
[00:49.600 --> 00:52.400]  And this is episode 175.
[00:53.060 --> 00:54.740]  I have a question for you guys.
[00:55.260 --> 00:56.240]  That I'd like to ask you.
[00:56.600 --> 00:57.540]  Is it how to spell Canada?
[00:58.280 --> 01:00.200]  No, I know how to spell it. Saying it is different.
[01:01.400 --> 01:06.860]  What is the longest time you were stupid before you realized you were stupid?
[01:06.860 --> 01:11.840]  Like you were doing something dumb or you had done something dumb and it was affecting your life.
[01:12.620 --> 01:16.880]  What's the longest amount of time you've gone being a f***ing idiot?
[01:17.200 --> 01:18.800]  I assume I'm still doing it.
[01:19.060 --> 01:21.720]  Yeah, there's still... I mean I have some factors for sure.
[01:21.840 --> 01:27.860]  I guess whatever the distance between me learning what a computer and keyboard is and learning that caps lock wasn't the only way.
[01:28.320 --> 01:29.440]  That's a long amount of time.
[01:29.920 --> 01:32.440]  That's probably 10 plus years.
[01:32.560 --> 01:33.640]  Probably like 15 years.
[01:33.640 --> 01:39.940]  I didn't know that you could charge up the mining beam in Starfield until I'd already beaten the game.
[01:40.140 --> 01:40.540]  Excuse me?
[01:40.920 --> 01:45.300]  Oh yeah, you could hold down the other trigger and it mines it in like a fraction of the time.
[01:45.560 --> 01:46.500]  Yeah, like boosts it up.
[01:46.720 --> 01:46.900]  What?
[01:48.800 --> 01:51.480]  It condenses the beam and makes it more powerful.
[01:51.740 --> 01:54.160]  It uses up the battery faster but it's just like...
[01:54.160 --> 01:54.640]  Done.
[01:57.360 --> 01:58.520]  God damn it.
[01:59.720 --> 02:02.760]  I don't mind because it takes so f***ing long and it's boring.
[02:03.660 --> 02:07.900]  Which means I don't build outposts and s*** because I don't want to mine because mining sucks.
[02:08.220 --> 02:09.240]  Well now you can.
[02:09.780 --> 02:11.180]  It's a lot easier than you thought.
[02:11.680 --> 02:13.660]  Gracie just said, who's stupid now?
[02:17.040 --> 02:17.480]  Savage.
[02:20.740 --> 02:22.040]  Oh my god.
[02:22.200 --> 02:24.540]  Well, I'll add Starfield onto the list.
[02:25.360 --> 02:26.660]  I have been...
[02:26.660 --> 02:29.940]  I ask and I feel better now because Andrew mentioned the keyboard thing and he said over 10 years.
[02:29.940 --> 02:35.640]  I just found out yesterday that I've been stupid for a little under 2 years.
[02:35.760 --> 02:37.100]  Oh wow.
[02:37.920 --> 02:39.040]  So what was that, like 2021?
[02:40.040 --> 02:41.080]  Yeah, about 2021.
[02:41.380 --> 02:43.500]  What did you start doing in 2021?
[02:44.480 --> 02:46.540]  Well, I'm going to tell you right now, it's iPhone related.
[02:47.660 --> 02:48.220]  Okay.
[02:49.300 --> 02:49.860]  I...
[02:50.520 --> 02:52.060]  At some point...
[02:52.060 --> 02:55.680]  You know, I have a car and my car has CarPlay, right?
[02:56.480 --> 02:57.380]  Where you hook...
[02:57.380 --> 02:57.620]  Yeah.
[02:57.620 --> 03:01.780]  You know, you just Bluetooth your iPhone to your car and then you can use your CarPlay.
[03:02.120 --> 03:05.060]  It's super, super convenient and awesome.
[03:05.900 --> 03:08.640]  However, and for about 2 years it was awesome in my car.
[03:08.740 --> 03:10.220]  And then one day it just stopped working.
[03:10.700 --> 03:12.920]  And I went...
[03:12.920 --> 03:13.820]  I...
[03:14.340 --> 03:16.480]  Did everything I could think of to fix it.
[03:16.980 --> 03:18.980]  You know, unpaired, repaired,
[03:19.560 --> 03:21.360]  fucking updated my phone,
[03:21.640 --> 03:22.520]  checked in with BMW
[03:22.520 --> 03:24.400]  to make sure there wasn't a firmware update
[03:24.400 --> 03:26.540]  for my fucking car or something.
[03:26.540 --> 03:28.600]  And I just assumed that
[03:28.600 --> 03:31.100]  I must have done something to break it
[03:31.100 --> 03:31.780]  or maybe...
[03:31.780 --> 03:34.320]  Like my iPhone at that point was a little janky.
[03:34.460 --> 03:36.780]  You know, I dropped it a bunch and the screens cracked and stuff.
[03:37.040 --> 03:38.820]  And I thought maybe I just jostled something
[03:38.820 --> 03:39.460]  or...
[03:39.460 --> 03:42.160]  But I tried for months and months and months to get it to work.
[03:42.200 --> 03:44.880]  As a matter of fact, then I would try to get it to work in Emily's car
[03:44.880 --> 03:46.080]  and it won't work in Emily's car.
[03:46.240 --> 03:48.440]  But I can use Emily's phone in my car
[03:48.440 --> 03:50.220]  and in her car and CarTalk works
[03:50.220 --> 03:52.300]  or CarPlay works just fine.
[03:52.640 --> 03:54.500]  So it's isolated to my phone.
[03:54.500 --> 03:56.060]  It's not my car, I discover.
[03:56.180 --> 03:57.200]  It's just my phone.
[03:58.460 --> 04:00.280]  And I'm not due to buy a new phone for a while
[04:00.280 --> 04:01.320]  so I'm like, eh, it's whatever.
[04:01.900 --> 04:04.060]  I go through that process over the first two or three months
[04:04.060 --> 04:05.540]  of this issue in 2021.
[04:06.100 --> 04:08.320]  And then I would say maybe
[04:08.920 --> 04:09.860]  twice a month
[04:09.860 --> 04:12.340]  from that point on until yesterday
[04:12.340 --> 04:14.180]  I would say,
[04:14.320 --> 04:15.240]  eh, let me give it another shot.
[04:15.580 --> 04:16.460]  Maybe it'll work this time.
[04:16.740 --> 04:19.280]  I updated my iPhone. Every time I updated my iPhone
[04:19.280 --> 04:22.040]  I immediately run out to my car and try to sync it and get it to work.
[04:22.040 --> 04:23.080]  It just doesn't work.
[04:23.140 --> 04:26.120]  So I have to manually connect my iPhone to my car
[04:26.120 --> 04:27.240]  with Bluetooth
[04:27.820 --> 04:29.820]  every time I get into my car
[04:29.820 --> 04:31.920]  so that I can listen to music and make calls and stuff.
[04:32.000 --> 04:33.700]  I don't have access to CarPlay at all
[04:33.700 --> 04:35.240]  but I have the more rudimentary
[04:35.740 --> 04:37.880]  Bluetooth access. But it's fucking annoying
[04:37.880 --> 04:39.440]  to have to manually connect it every time.
[04:40.140 --> 04:41.860]  And so I've probably tried
[04:41.860 --> 04:44.080]  to reinstall and get my phone
[04:44.080 --> 04:46.280]  to work with CarPlay in my car
[04:46.280 --> 04:47.660]  I'm gonna guess
[04:48.190 --> 04:49.840]  legitimately 80 to 100 times
[04:49.840 --> 04:52.100]  over the past two years or so.
[04:52.220 --> 04:53.380]  I've read about it on Google
[04:53.860 --> 04:56.340]  I've looked it up on BMW's support forums
[04:56.340 --> 04:58.060]  I have found nobody else
[04:58.060 --> 04:59.320]  with my specific problem
[04:59.320 --> 05:01.820]  nobody else complaining about this issue
[05:02.500 --> 05:02.900]  and
[05:03.860 --> 05:05.340]  I'm just befuddled and I'm lost
[05:05.340 --> 05:07.440]  and so I just give up and I decide
[05:07.440 --> 05:09.540]  even though I still try, even knowing it's not gonna work
[05:09.540 --> 05:10.640]  a couple times a month
[05:10.640 --> 05:13.720]  I just have given up on ever using CarPlay on my phone again
[05:14.240 --> 05:15.300]  or on my car again.
[05:15.820 --> 05:17.220]  Then I got the new iPhone 15
[05:17.220 --> 05:19.200]  and the first thing I did
[05:19.200 --> 05:20.720]  after setting it up, which by the way
[05:21.240 --> 05:23.280]  I don't understand how
[05:23.280 --> 05:25.340]  it gets harder to set up a
[05:25.340 --> 05:27.360]  fucking iPhone every new iteration
[05:27.360 --> 05:29.200]  They even give you like
[05:29.200 --> 05:31.060]  just scan this code and it'll fucking work
[05:31.060 --> 05:33.060]  No, it doesn't. I still have to call and spend
[05:33.060 --> 05:35.060]  45 minutes on the phone with AT&T
[05:35.060 --> 05:37.720]  because something's not fucking toggled on their end
[05:37.720 --> 05:39.200]  and you gotta go through their fucking
[05:39.200 --> 05:41.400]  whole complicated
[05:41.400 --> 05:42.800]  and confusing tree
[05:42.800 --> 05:45.000]  to just get to talk to a human fucking person
[05:46.080 --> 05:46.840]  and it's just like
[05:48.060 --> 05:49.060]  you get a new phone
[05:49.060 --> 05:51.480]  you turn it on and it goes, hey man, do you want to set this phone up?
[05:51.500 --> 05:52.640]  and you go, yeah, I want to set it up
[05:52.640 --> 05:55.060]  and it's like, we gotcha! This is the 15th version
[05:55.060 --> 05:57.080]  of this phone, we know how to do it, we know how to do it well
[05:57.080 --> 05:59.400]  Do you want to restore it from the cloud
[05:59.400 --> 06:01.060]  or from your local phone? Either way
[06:01.060 --> 06:03.040]  you try it and it's like, no problem dude, just hit this button
[06:03.040 --> 06:04.200]  hit this button, now it's gonna work
[06:04.200 --> 06:07.080]  and then it goes, hey wait, it didn't work, there's a problem, try again
[06:07.080 --> 06:09.400]  and you try again and they're like, uh, I don't know what to tell you
[06:09.720 --> 06:11.140]  this doesn't work, call AT&T
[06:11.140 --> 06:12.640]  and you're like, god damn it!
[06:12.640 --> 06:15.480]  So anyway, after I go through all of that
[06:15.480 --> 06:17.300]  I run out to my car, I'm very excited
[06:17.300 --> 06:19.060]  and I set up my phone
[06:19.060 --> 06:21.520]  and I hit connect, I hit to pair it
[06:21.520 --> 06:22.360]  and it starts to pair
[06:22.820 --> 06:25.220]  and this same thing happens with my other iPhone
[06:25.220 --> 06:27.400]  it just pairs, it tries to pair forever
[06:27.400 --> 06:29.660]  and then it eventually gives an undefined error message
[06:29.660 --> 06:31.040]  and so I do it
[06:31.040 --> 06:32.340]  and it fucking does that
[06:32.340 --> 06:35.320]  and I get that error message and I go, you gotta be kidding me
[06:35.320 --> 06:36.740]  you gotta be fucking kidding me
[06:36.740 --> 06:38.220]  I know it's not the car
[06:38.220 --> 06:40.880]  because I've connected other cars to this fucking phone before
[06:40.880 --> 06:43.740]  or other phones to this fucking car before
[06:44.840 --> 06:45.760]  what the fuck
[06:45.760 --> 06:47.300]  and I just said, you know what, I'm gonna try again
[06:47.300 --> 06:48.220]  I'm gonna try a second time
[06:48.220 --> 06:51.340]  and for some reason when I tried a second time and it didn't work
[06:51.340 --> 06:53.100]  it gave me a different error message
[06:53.100 --> 06:55.020]  that it's never given me before
[06:55.020 --> 06:56.640]  and that error message says
[06:57.160 --> 06:58.580]  CarPlay doesn't work on
[06:59.080 --> 07:01.640]  doesn't work on iPhones that don't have Siri enabled
[07:01.640 --> 07:02.300]  and I went
[07:02.900 --> 07:05.240]  I did disable Siri about two years ago
[07:05.240 --> 07:07.080]  I did
[07:07.080 --> 07:08.960]  I did disable Siri about two years ago
[07:10.180 --> 07:11.500]  and so I
[07:11.500 --> 07:12.520]  enabled Siri
[07:12.520 --> 07:15.100]  by the way the first thing I did on my new phone was I disabled Siri
[07:15.100 --> 07:16.020]  because I don't use it
[07:16.020 --> 07:18.440]  and so I enabled Siri and it connected immediately
[07:19.040 --> 07:21.300]  and just to check on my old phone
[07:21.300 --> 07:22.380]  it connected immediately
[07:22.380 --> 07:25.020]  I spent two years without CarPlay because I
[07:25.020 --> 07:27.060]  disabled Siri. So if you are having a similar
[07:27.060 --> 07:28.360]  issue out there and I'm guessing you're not
[07:28.360 --> 07:30.880]  because I saw zero people complaining about it online
[07:30.880 --> 07:32.140]  enable Siri
[07:33.080 --> 07:35.400]  I don't ever use Siri
[07:35.400 --> 07:36.140]  but I also
[07:36.700 --> 07:37.760]  it doesn't really come
[07:38.280 --> 07:40.280]  just don't use it. Do you have to actually
[07:40.280 --> 07:41.060]  disable it?
[07:42.240 --> 07:44.320]  Do I have to disable it? Apparently not. No I'm living
[07:44.320 --> 07:46.400]  with it now. I just always bump it on accident or something
[07:46.400 --> 07:48.240]  and a little thing pops up and I'm like shut up
[07:48.240 --> 07:50.240]  I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to talk to anybody
[07:50.240 --> 07:52.280]  let alone a robot lady in my
[07:52.280 --> 07:54.320]  fucking pocket. I turn off like the always
[07:54.320 --> 07:56.580]  listing part but I think it's on in general
[07:57.100 --> 07:58.300]  Well I'm a Siri user
[07:58.300 --> 08:00.400]  again now because it's the only way I can get CarPlay to work
[08:00.400 --> 08:01.880]  but I want my two years back
[08:01.880 --> 08:04.000]  I can't believe that nothing on Google
[08:04.000 --> 08:06.140]  came up with that. That's crazy. Nothing
[08:06.140 --> 08:08.200]  and I never got that error message before
[08:08.200 --> 08:09.840]  Yeah that's also very weird
[08:10.740 --> 08:11.220]  but
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.160]  regardless it's my fault and I should have
[08:14.160 --> 08:15.840]  tried that. I should have thought of that
[08:15.840 --> 08:17.760]  I wouldn't have thought of that
[08:18.360 --> 08:20.020]  Yeah they seem so disconnected
[08:20.020 --> 08:22.140]  I wouldn't make the assumption that those two would
[08:22.140 --> 08:24.240]  be synced. Years 46
[08:24.240 --> 08:26.260]  to 48 of my life were lesser
[08:26.260 --> 08:28.120]  than they should have been and I'm a little
[08:28.120 --> 08:30.300]  pissed off about it. But I'm only mad at me
[08:30.300 --> 08:32.120]  It wasn't anything to do
[08:32.120 --> 08:33.560]  with the massive pandemic
[08:33.560 --> 08:36.440]  it was the fact that CarPlay didn't work
[08:36.440 --> 08:37.760]  Listen, I've already
[08:37.760 --> 08:39.780]  accounted for the pandemic
[08:39.780 --> 08:42.040]  and I've figured that out. This is new information
[08:42.040 --> 08:44.220]  that I'm dealing with. This is a new disappointment
[08:45.100 --> 08:45.580]  Ugh
[08:46.940 --> 08:48.040]  And Gracie said
[08:48.040 --> 08:49.940]  she would have asked Siri how to solve the problem
[08:51.400 --> 08:52.380]  That would have worked
[08:52.380 --> 08:54.340]  I talked about the caviar phone
[08:54.960 --> 08:55.860]  last episode
[08:55.860 --> 08:57.520]  the idea of the caviar phone
[08:58.020 --> 09:00.640]  I have bought a caviar phone
[09:00.640 --> 09:03.120]  The problem is
[09:03.120 --> 09:04.920]  it's not my caviar phone
[09:04.920 --> 09:06.800]  my normal phone just doesn't
[09:06.800 --> 09:08.300]  work. It's broken
[09:08.640 --> 09:10.600]  Do not
[09:10.600 --> 09:12.540]  buy refurbished phones
[09:12.540 --> 09:14.300]  is a lesson I've had to realize
[09:14.720 --> 09:16.720]  I have a Google
[09:16.720 --> 09:18.860]  Pixel graveyard at my desk
[09:18.860 --> 09:20.840]  I am finding pixels I didn't
[09:20.840 --> 09:22.840]  know I had. This is my fourth
[09:22.840 --> 09:24.880]  Pixel. I've gone through four Google
[09:24.880 --> 09:26.740]  Pixels in probably three years
[09:26.740 --> 09:28.740]  each one breaking in a different way
[09:28.740 --> 09:30.280]  The most recent one
[09:30.280 --> 09:31.400]  similar to Geoff's
[09:31.400 --> 09:33.860]  it just doesn't connect to my mobile network
[09:33.860 --> 09:35.680]  It just will not connect no matter what I do
[09:35.680 --> 09:37.460]  I factory reset it
[09:37.460 --> 09:39.600]  I've tried to reboot in safe mode
[09:39.600 --> 09:40.940]  I've done all these things
[09:40.940 --> 09:43.320]  Googling and it just seems to be a bug
[09:43.320 --> 09:45.600]  where they're like yeah they updated the security at one point
[09:45.600 --> 09:47.800]  and now sometimes it just doesn't connect for people
[09:47.800 --> 09:48.480]  with certain phones
[09:48.480 --> 09:49.820]  So it used to?
[09:50.160 --> 09:51.180]  It used to I guess
[09:51.180 --> 09:54.940]  but this one has had this problem since I bought it refurbished
[09:54.940 --> 09:56.940]  but when I would reboot it
[09:56.940 --> 09:58.960]  it would work and then last night
[09:58.960 --> 10:01.180]  it just stopped working entirely
[10:01.180 --> 10:03.540]  it just will not sync no matter what I do
[10:03.540 --> 10:05.340]  Are you sure it's not locked to a different
[10:05.340 --> 10:06.620]  network? Positive
[10:06.620 --> 10:09.100]  I went through the whole process to make sure it's unlocked
[10:09.100 --> 10:09.900]  and all that stuff
[10:09.900 --> 10:12.080]  It just will not connect
[10:12.080 --> 10:15.140]  and it seems to be a common problem that there isn't really
[10:15.140 --> 10:17.120]  a specific fix for outside
[10:17.120 --> 10:18.640]  of like replacing the motherboard
[10:19.140 --> 10:21.040]  which is more complicated than
[10:21.040 --> 10:21.640]  I want to do
[10:21.640 --> 10:23.740]  I don't want to take it in because it's a
[10:23.740 --> 10:25.920]  refurbished, like it's a piece of shit essentially
[10:25.920 --> 10:28.080]  but I'm done with refurbished phones
[10:28.080 --> 10:29.700]  and I've now ended up with a
[10:29.700 --> 10:30.580]  caviar phone
[10:32.140 --> 10:32.940]  for myself
[10:33.420 --> 10:35.620]  which is, I actually don't own it yet
[10:35.620 --> 10:36.920]  I shouldn't say I own one yet
[10:36.920 --> 10:39.600]  I went to buy it and I put in my
[10:39.600 --> 10:41.300]  information and it said great
[10:42.580 --> 10:43.780]  my bank then
[10:43.780 --> 10:45.680]  sent a notification saying through the
[10:45.680 --> 10:47.840]  website we have texted your phone
[10:47.840 --> 10:49.540]  to confirm that you want to go through this
[10:49.540 --> 10:51.220]  So I am unable
[10:52.200 --> 10:53.560]  I'm unable to do
[10:53.560 --> 10:55.500]  I think I'm just done with Google in general
[10:55.500 --> 10:57.740]  I hate Google so much
[10:57.740 --> 10:59.100]  I was trying to recover
[10:59.640 --> 11:01.140]  complete aside, an email
[11:01.640 --> 11:03.380]  I knew the password to the account
[11:03.380 --> 11:06.180]  You got like another level of angry mid-sentence
[11:06.180 --> 11:07.780]  I'm not mad, I'm just thinking about
[11:07.780 --> 11:08.800]  my Google issues recently
[11:08.800 --> 11:11.740]  I set up an email
[11:11.740 --> 11:13.380]  for my mom in like 2016
[11:14.080 --> 11:15.820]  and there was an issue with it
[11:15.820 --> 11:16.980]  and she couldn't get into her Pinterest
[11:16.980 --> 11:19.280]  and so I said I'd try to
[11:19.280 --> 11:21.280]  figure it out for her and I went through it
[11:21.280 --> 11:23.200]  I determined what the password is
[11:23.200 --> 11:25.160]  I have the recovery email sent
[11:25.160 --> 11:27.120]  to my alternate email so I was getting
[11:27.120 --> 11:28.280]  like hey this is you emails
[11:28.280 --> 11:31.160]  the only problem is the phone it was
[11:31.160 --> 11:32.920]  connected to was her landline
[11:32.920 --> 11:35.220]  that doesn't exist anymore, it's long gone
[11:35.220 --> 11:36.380]  it was a landline number
[11:36.960 --> 11:39.140]  so I'd go to that and I'd say well I don't
[11:39.140 --> 11:41.180]  have this number and they'd say well go fuck yourself
[11:41.180 --> 11:43.260]  we need that. Why is it not
[11:43.260 --> 11:45.440]  enough for me to know the password to the account
[11:45.440 --> 11:47.440]  have the alternate email
[11:47.440 --> 11:49.760]  I have every piece, they're just like you don't have
[11:49.760 --> 11:51.460]  all four of what you need
[11:51.460 --> 11:53.660]  having the password for the account and the alternate
[11:53.660 --> 11:55.780]  what's the point of having an alternate email
[11:55.780 --> 11:57.020]  on it? I hate Google
[11:57.520 --> 11:59.600]  I don't even have a caviar phone yet I'm gonna have to
[11:59.600 --> 12:01.660]  fucking go to 7-Eleven to try to
[12:01.660 --> 12:03.600]  buy a phone, it's a nightmare, I'm living in
[12:03.600 --> 12:05.520]  phone hell. Can you imagine
[12:05.520 --> 12:07.480]  explaining that problem to your
[12:07.480 --> 12:09.700]  grandfather in like 1955?
[12:11.960 --> 12:13.660]  It was tough to explain
[12:13.660 --> 12:15.060]  to my mom in 2023
[12:16.720 --> 12:17.800]  this is what
[12:17.800 --> 12:19.640]  passes for problems in our future
[12:19.640 --> 12:21.880]  you'd be explaining to him all the things
[12:21.880 --> 12:23.880]  that aren't invented yet that you need
[12:23.880 --> 12:25.080]  to use a telephone
[12:26.300 --> 12:27.540]  to use a telephone
[12:28.500 --> 12:29.740]  and he's like hey just go
[12:29.740 --> 12:31.560]  down to the fucking
[12:31.560 --> 12:33.700]  Ma Bell and just rent a new phone
[12:33.700 --> 12:35.880]  what are you talking about? They come in three
[12:35.880 --> 12:36.340]  colors
[12:38.520 --> 12:39.880]  also while you were telling that
[12:39.880 --> 12:41.840]  hilarious story Andrew, I googled
[12:41.840 --> 12:44.240]  caviar phone just for the hell of it and it exists
[12:44.240 --> 12:46.380]  what? yeah those look awesome
[12:46.380 --> 12:48.200]  sublime luxury samsung
[12:48.200 --> 12:48.700]  galaxy
[12:49.860 --> 12:51.940]  is it like a rebranded samsung
[12:51.940 --> 12:53.420]  by caviar? it looks like it
[12:55.060 --> 12:55.860]  that is
[12:55.860 --> 12:58.240]  deluxe, I can't wait for you to get one of those
[12:58.240 --> 12:59.820]  nah I don't think they're gonna have that
[12:59.820 --> 13:01.220]  at the corner store but I'll let you know
[13:01.220 --> 13:03.960]  I'll text you in 6 days when I'm
[13:03.960 --> 13:05.960]  able to activate this thing
[13:05.960 --> 13:07.380]  and do all that shit, oh it's a nightmare
[13:07.960 --> 13:09.780]  so what broke on the phone that
[13:09.780 --> 13:10.820]  the pixel that I sent you?
[13:11.200 --> 13:14.180]  I dropped it on the bed
[13:14.180 --> 13:15.620]  and the screen
[13:15.620 --> 13:16.580]  turned off
[13:16.580 --> 13:19.360]  and that's different to the one that you
[13:19.980 --> 13:20.540]  bit
[13:20.540 --> 13:23.200]  I think that damaged the integrity
[13:23.200 --> 13:24.600]  I think that was the same phone
[13:24.600 --> 13:26.840]  I think that weakened the screen integrity
[13:26.840 --> 13:30.240]  and then I like dropped it face first
[13:30.240 --> 13:31.760]  on a soft
[13:31.760 --> 13:33.980]  bed and the screen just went out
[13:33.980 --> 13:36.200]  it was like barely holding on I guess
[13:36.200 --> 13:37.800]  then the one after that
[13:38.900 --> 13:39.800]  was a
[13:39.800 --> 13:41.440]  I think that was on me
[13:41.440 --> 13:43.100]  I think I dropped it in the tub
[13:43.100 --> 13:44.580]  that was a tub issue
[13:44.580 --> 13:47.660]  the third one, the screen
[13:47.660 --> 13:49.340]  also just randomly died
[13:49.340 --> 13:51.940]  and the fourth one will not
[13:51.940 --> 13:53.800]  connect to my network no matter what I do
[13:54.480 --> 13:55.440]  it's pointless
[13:55.840 --> 13:57.660]  as currently, here's the issue too
[13:57.660 --> 13:59.920]  when I set it up, when I factory
[13:59.920 --> 14:01.960]  reset it, I don't know my gmail
[14:01.960 --> 14:03.600]  password and with my gmail history
[14:03.600 --> 14:05.920]  I'm scared to like, an easy way to
[14:05.920 --> 14:08.160]  figure it out is you sign out and then if it's
[14:08.160 --> 14:10.340]  saved in your computer, it'll autofill
[14:10.340 --> 14:11.960]  and then you can click show password
[14:11.960 --> 14:13.940]  I'm scared to do it because I bet you
[14:13.940 --> 14:16.040]  if I do sign out, it will ask to like
[14:16.040 --> 14:18.040]  text my phone to confirm that
[14:18.040 --> 14:20.340]  and I'll just go through that cycle again, so I can't do that
[14:20.340 --> 14:22.120]  so I just, my phone currently
[14:22.120 --> 14:23.740]  is essentially just an alarm clock
[14:23.740 --> 14:26.000]  the only functionality I have on it
[14:26.000 --> 14:27.880]  I know you don't want other people's old phones anymore
[14:27.880 --> 14:29.940]  but if it helps, I have an iPhone 13
[14:29.940 --> 14:32.100]  here that as of yesterday connects
[14:32.100 --> 14:33.700]  to CarPlay, that's a pretty cool feature
[14:33.700 --> 14:35.820]  well that's pretty cool, also I'm willing to join
[14:35.820 --> 14:37.360]  the villain side now, I know you guys
[14:37.800 --> 14:39.760]  tick on my bubbles, the videos
[14:39.760 --> 14:41.980]  that won't process correctly, me being the Android
[14:41.980 --> 14:43.620]  guy in the text chats, I
[14:43.620 --> 14:46.000]  this is the closest I've been to joining the other
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.280]  side. Well my biggest issue is that I can't
[14:48.280 --> 14:49.540]  I don't have any signal
[14:49.540 --> 14:51.880]  and it takes me like 17
[14:51.880 --> 14:53.780]  attempts to send you one picture and then
[14:53.780 --> 14:55.720]  I'm pretty sure you get them 17 times
[14:55.720 --> 14:57.580]  even though it says message not sent
[14:57.580 --> 14:59.900]  well you did recently send me a
[14:59.900 --> 15:01.820]  three ha ha ha ha but
[15:01.820 --> 15:03.820]  it went through twice so I counted that as a six
[15:03.820 --> 15:04.280]  oh
[15:06.020 --> 15:08.220]  I did that as a good, I boosted
[15:08.220 --> 15:09.800]  myself, I gave myself a little bump
[15:09.800 --> 15:11.480]  in the ranks of how funny what I sent you was
[15:14.320 --> 15:15.820]  wow a three
[15:15.820 --> 15:17.540]  ha's huh? Oh
[15:17.540 --> 15:19.740]  six actually, well before
[15:19.740 --> 15:21.900]  yeah, were you afraid you were having
[15:21.900 --> 15:23.960]  an off day there or something? No a three ha
[15:23.960 --> 15:25.540]  is like fine, I'm okay with a three ha
[15:25.540 --> 15:27.960]  that's good. That's a pretty fucking bare minimum
[15:27.960 --> 15:29.860]  I think. Well you're very
[15:29.860 --> 15:32.380]  you're generous with your ha's, you're like a ten ha guy
[15:33.200 --> 15:33.840]  you can
[15:33.840 --> 15:35.720]  send eight ha's and it's a base hit
[15:35.720 --> 15:37.660]  you get a two or a three ha from me
[15:37.660 --> 15:40.120]  that's... I did not
[15:40.120 --> 15:42.120]  yeah no you're right it's a different scale
[15:42.120 --> 15:43.720]  for you but for Gavin a three ha's
[15:43.720 --> 15:46.140]  that was funny. I think I've noticed with Eric
[15:46.140 --> 15:48.000]  I think Eric's more of a lol guy
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.220]  I made a conscious effort
[15:50.220 --> 15:51.820]  last year that I
[15:52.380 --> 15:54.000]  ha ha ha is a
[15:54.000 --> 15:55.880]  good response sometimes when something I find
[15:55.880 --> 15:57.640]  genuinely funny. LOL
[15:57.640 --> 15:59.660]  has a great
[15:59.660 --> 16:01.680]  condescending tone to it that
[16:01.680 --> 16:03.700]  I have really adopted and
[16:03.700 --> 16:05.800]  since last year I've been hanging on
[16:05.800 --> 16:07.560]  to it so I've been an LOL
[16:07.560 --> 16:09.800]  all lowercase LOL guy
[16:09.800 --> 16:11.840]  for a little while now. Oh I don't know what that
[16:11.840 --> 16:13.900]  says about me and my messages to you. No I think it's good
[16:13.900 --> 16:15.560]  because they're funny but at the same time
[16:15.560 --> 16:17.820]  I want you to read it and go is that a little
[16:17.820 --> 16:19.280]  bit condescending? And
[16:19.840 --> 16:20.200]  maybe
[16:21.480 --> 16:23.840]  this is what I think of when I hear LOL
[16:23.840 --> 16:26.080]  now. Oh LOL surprise
[16:26.080 --> 16:28.320]  I don't know what those are. What is that?
[16:29.160 --> 16:30.260]  I've seen them all over the
[16:30.260 --> 16:31.160]  place but I don't know.
[16:32.560 --> 16:34.200]  Emily's sister's kids are really into
[16:34.200 --> 16:36.260]  them so I see them opened up a lot at
[16:36.260 --> 16:37.160]  Christmases and birthdays.
[16:38.300 --> 16:40.120]  Is it like a... Hold on
[16:40.120 --> 16:42.200]  Gracie said there's a freaky scandal with
[16:42.200 --> 16:44.360]  those dolls. Somebody get Gracie a microphone
[16:44.360 --> 16:46.200]  god damn it. We're already on it
[16:46.200 --> 16:48.100]  um well yeah
[16:48.100 --> 16:50.320]  Gracie jump off mute. Sorry if this part
[16:50.320 --> 16:52.160]  sounds bad but yeah. Okay well I don't
[16:52.160 --> 16:54.240]  have a mic but if you dip the
[16:54.240 --> 16:56.300]  dolls in cold water their clothes come off and they're
[16:56.300 --> 16:58.300]  wearing like bondage. Is
[16:58.300 --> 16:59.100]  that true though?
[17:00.020 --> 17:02.300]  I will show you a picture. I had to do my entire project
[17:02.300 --> 17:04.120]  on it. Is that the LOL surprises?
[17:08.000 --> 17:08.440]  LOL
[17:08.440 --> 17:08.820]  LOL
[17:08.820 --> 17:10.340]  Surprise! S&M
[17:10.340 --> 17:11.060]  um
[17:13.140 --> 17:14.600]  That's wild. Yeah I didn't
[17:14.600 --> 17:16.380]  that's it's funny that that's
[17:16.380 --> 17:18.000]  the only thing I know about this product now
[17:18.660 --> 17:20.340]  I know one fact about it
[17:20.340 --> 17:22.040]  their bondage when dipped in water
[17:22.040 --> 17:24.240]  which is not a great kids toy
[17:24.240 --> 17:26.300]  yeah now I'm faced with
[17:26.300 --> 17:28.080]  knowing the answer to this
[17:28.080 --> 17:30.120]  do I have a responsibility to
[17:30.120 --> 17:31.140]  tell the family
[17:32.360 --> 17:33.640]  I'm not staying out of it
[17:34.140 --> 17:35.560]  yeah you just avoid it
[17:35.560 --> 17:37.260]  you don't get into that
[17:37.260 --> 17:40.240]  Geoff you just let it be. Did you ever have those
[17:40.240 --> 17:41.600]  those little alien
[17:42.220 --> 17:43.900]  squishy alien in the eggs
[17:43.900 --> 17:45.820]  things and everyone said that if you
[17:45.820 --> 17:48.360]  like tied their dicks together they'd make a baby alien
[17:48.360 --> 17:49.500]  what no
[17:49.500 --> 17:52.120]  what does any of that mean
[17:52.120 --> 17:53.560]  what the fuck are you talking about
[17:53.560 --> 17:54.880]  I first of all don't know
[17:55.340 --> 17:57.640]  I don't know what your toy is
[17:57.640 --> 17:59.680]  and I also don't know who the everyone is
[17:59.680 --> 18:01.420]  I didn't have either of those in my life
[18:01.420 --> 18:03.660]  do you tie a lot of dicks together
[18:03.660 --> 18:05.320]  no I never had one
[18:05.320 --> 18:07.740]  it was like a little plastic
[18:07.740 --> 18:09.100]  egg with slime inside
[18:09.100 --> 18:11.980]  and in the slime was like a little
[18:13.080 --> 18:14.000]  rubbery alien
[18:14.000 --> 18:15.140]  like stretchy alien
[18:15.610 --> 18:17.000]  but everyone would always say that like
[18:17.000 --> 18:21.020]  Because they had dicks. Everyone always said if you tied the dicks together a baby alien
[18:21.020 --> 18:21.380]  would grow.
[18:21.500 --> 18:22.340]  Who's everyone?
[18:22.880 --> 18:24.200]  Just all of my friends who had it.
[18:24.680 --> 18:26.140]  Is that what it looked like?
[18:26.580 --> 18:31.260]  Yeah, but it had a schlong. And then all my friends were like, yeah, yeah, yeah, if you
[18:31.260 --> 18:32.920]  tie the dicks together it makes a little baby alien.
[18:33.160 --> 18:36.140]  They're like, okay, so what's going on here?
[18:37.840 --> 18:40.040]  Is that what... these ones don't have dicks.
[18:40.160 --> 18:42.220]  They're making a baby alien.
[18:42.220 --> 18:49.460]  I found a website, Lab Bible, that is, you know, just like Barstool, but for like blokes.
[18:51.000 --> 18:55.680]  Scientific experiment confirms once and for all whether goo aliens can have babies.
[18:56.020 --> 18:58.720]  And it is exactly what Gavin is talking about.
[18:58.840 --> 19:00.460]  They did an experiment to see.
[19:01.160 --> 19:01.420]  Yeah.
[19:01.600 --> 19:03.020]  So my friends would never show me.
[19:03.060 --> 19:08.820]  And one day I was like, look, I really don't believe that tying these two alien dicks together
[19:08.820 --> 19:09.680]  would make a baby.
[19:09.680 --> 19:12.420]  So two of my friends tried it and they're like, oh yeah, it didn't work.
[19:12.500 --> 19:13.580]  It's not working.
[19:15.040 --> 19:19.260]  Like it was like a problem with those specific aliens, but I was like, how, how would it,
[19:19.480 --> 19:20.660]  how did that rumor start?
[19:20.740 --> 19:21.460]  Where'd that come from?
[19:21.920 --> 19:22.400]  Yeah, I don't know.
[19:22.680 --> 19:26.220]  I thought you're talking about like those dinosaurs you put in water and they'd grow.
[19:26.560 --> 19:27.440]  Those are always awesome.
[19:27.780 --> 19:28.000]  As a kid.
[19:28.040 --> 19:29.400]  The little sponge pill thing?
[19:29.600 --> 19:32.820]  Yeah, the little sponge things you put in the water and then like the next day it would
[19:32.820 --> 19:32.940]  become huge.
[19:32.940 --> 19:34.360]  Yeah, they were the shit.
[19:34.760 --> 19:37.420]  So your friends, your friends were like, what do you want to do after school today?
[19:37.440 --> 19:38.680]  You want to go play cricket?
[19:38.680 --> 19:39.840]  Like nah, football?
[19:40.760 --> 19:40.980]  Nah.
[19:41.160 --> 19:42.820]  What if we tied alien dicks together?
[19:42.960 --> 19:44.100]  I'll be over at 315.
[19:44.360 --> 19:49.360]  It was like a, a well known thing that it worked, but no one had ever seen it work.
[19:50.380 --> 19:56.660]  How does that stuff, how does like the schoolyard stuff kind of like prevent, yeah, right.
[19:56.960 --> 19:59.700]  Like propagate to all the schoolyards around the world.
[19:59.760 --> 20:00.260]  I don't know.
[20:00.320 --> 20:05.600]  Like there's stuff like Rod Stewart and Richard Gere that have like urban legends and I just
[20:05.600 --> 20:08.540]  don't know how me in third grade hears about that.
[20:08.580 --> 20:11.600]  What happens if you tie Richard Gere's dick to Rod Stewart's?
[20:12.940 --> 20:14.320]  A gerbil comes out of his ass.
[20:15.480 --> 20:20.640]  I think this just might be genius marketing from the company because really what they're
[20:20.640 --> 20:23.740]  selling is buy two, get one free in this environment.
[20:24.480 --> 20:28.680]  It's like, it's a trick to get you to buy two aliens and it ultimately gives you nothing
[20:28.680 --> 20:31.040]  under the belief of you're going to get a free third one.
[20:31.700 --> 20:31.880]  Yeah.
[20:31.900 --> 20:34.780]  I feel like if that came from within the company, it's the most genius thing I've ever heard.
[20:34.780 --> 20:35.640]  How do we?
[20:35.760 --> 20:35.880]  All right.
[20:35.940 --> 20:36.780]  Well, all right.
[20:36.860 --> 20:37.200]  Hold on.
[20:37.320 --> 20:38.120]  How do we do that?
[20:38.760 --> 20:39.200]  What do you mean?
[20:39.340 --> 20:40.260]  What do we like?
[20:40.380 --> 20:41.640]  If you, how do we do that?
[20:41.760 --> 20:42.740]  How do we tie alien dicks?
[20:43.260 --> 20:43.700]  No, no, no.
[20:43.760 --> 20:49.160]  How do we, how do we, how do we propagate some sort of a schoolyard thing so that people
[20:49.160 --> 20:53.740]  think they have to buy two f*** face merch items and have them have sex to make a new
[20:53.740 --> 20:54.700]  f*** face merch item?
[20:55.060 --> 20:55.220]  What?
[20:55.260 --> 20:56.240]  We getting into scamming?
[20:56.540 --> 20:56.860]  Yeah.
[20:56.900 --> 20:58.160]  I don't want to do that to the audience.
[20:58.320 --> 21:02.380]  Second of all, I don't think you can when you talk about it within the thing.
[21:02.380 --> 21:04.960]  I think that's a, a secret or subtle.
[21:05.240 --> 21:06.120]  It won't work.
[21:06.220 --> 21:09.920]  It won't work for everybody who listens to 175, but think of all the people that miss
[21:09.920 --> 21:10.040]  it.
[21:10.280 --> 21:11.820]  And then somebody will mention it.
[21:11.860 --> 21:13.040]  This is how these things propagate.
[21:13.540 --> 21:16.020]  Do you think maybe it's a thing where like we try to get people to listen?
[21:16.120 --> 21:19.920]  It's like, it's like if you listen to stuff backwards or you like listen to the episode
[21:19.920 --> 21:20.540]  two times.
[21:20.800 --> 21:21.180]  Oh, that's.
[21:21.340 --> 21:21.760]  I like that.
[21:22.560 --> 21:24.400]  I like a listening version of that.
[21:24.480 --> 21:25.120]  Not a monetary.
[21:25.460 --> 21:25.640]  Yeah.
[21:25.640 --> 21:33.300]  Like if you, if you, uh, if you wear an Ian shirt, uh, and say, and say pencil three
[21:33.300 --> 21:37.020]  times into a, into a mirror with the lights off, Ian will appear behind you or something.
[21:37.440 --> 21:38.100]  That's great.
[21:38.640 --> 21:41.880]  You know, my favorite one of those is, and I, I'm so mad that I don't remember her name.
[21:41.960 --> 21:49.240]  She was such a fucking smart, um, ad executive, but she is the reason why in Alka-Seltzer
[21:49.240 --> 21:53.640]  ads they drop in two tablets in the commercial because I guess you only need one and they're
[21:53.640 --> 21:54.540]  originally doing one.
[21:54.540 --> 21:58.760]  And she realized that if they displayed people using two, they would use the product more
[21:58.760 --> 22:02.680]  frequently and they would sell more and like almost overnight doubled the sales.
[22:02.840 --> 22:04.400]  Can you OD on Alka-Seltzer?
[22:04.640 --> 22:05.380]  I don't know.
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.900]  It seems like a vicious thing to OD from like you'd explode.
[22:08.920 --> 22:13.300]  I think you could OD on anything, but also it makes sense with the marketing too, right?
[22:13.340 --> 22:17.640]  Because plop fizz isn't nearly as fun to say as plop plop fizz fizz.
[22:17.760 --> 22:18.300]  Oh, what a relief.
[22:18.300 --> 22:18.980]  That's very true.
[22:19.680 --> 22:21.140]  You can't have that second plop.
[22:21.280 --> 22:21.420]  Yeah.
[22:21.840 --> 22:26.580]  Um, can I take a step back in what we were talking, you were talking about Ian, like,
[22:26.660 --> 22:32.700]  you know, Ian appears behind you, whatever, at a merch meeting that, uh, that, that you
[22:32.700 --> 22:37.940]  missed earlier this week, Andrew, and, uh, you're thinking of me, it was me and Tony
[22:37.940 --> 22:43.740]  kind of like kicking around a couple of ideas and he said something about it, like an Ian,
[22:43.880 --> 22:47.680]  you know, what would like an Ian like figure, like a bobblehead be, you know, is that something?
[22:47.680 --> 22:51.400]  And I'm like, oh, that's like such a fun, it's like such a funny idea to do like a bobblehead
[22:51.400 --> 22:51.680]  Ian.
[22:51.820 --> 22:52.360]  And he's like, right.
[22:52.440 --> 22:53.660]  So what's the back of Ian's head?
[22:53.960 --> 22:56.960]  And I don't know the answer to that question.
[22:57.320 --> 22:58.240]  Is there a back?
[22:58.820 --> 23:00.400]  Well, the back is facing downwards.
[23:02.040 --> 23:03.380]  It would just be like a sauce.
[23:03.480 --> 23:04.960]  It would just be like a hot dog roll, right?
[23:05.940 --> 23:06.180]  Yes.
[23:06.420 --> 23:06.660]  Yeah.
[23:07.380 --> 23:08.340]  You'd have a little head roll.
[23:10.160 --> 23:11.220]  Is that what it is?
[23:11.960 --> 23:12.120]  I think.
[23:12.600 --> 23:16.960]  Well, it was just, I was like, that could be my second sentence.
[23:17.600 --> 23:18.560]  Andrew's running out of bits.
[23:18.820 --> 23:18.840]  Yeah.
[23:18.880 --> 23:19.360]  Okay, cool.
[23:19.360 --> 23:20.200]  So it's not just, okay.
[23:20.260 --> 23:20.840]  I thought it was me.
[23:21.080 --> 23:21.720]  No, he's not worried.
[23:21.980 --> 23:23.160]  Did you leave the planet?
[23:23.580 --> 23:24.700]  What do you mean?
[23:24.760 --> 23:25.880]  Did you switch to your pixel?
[23:26.800 --> 23:27.140]  What's that?
[23:27.500 --> 23:28.080]  Are you on your pixel?
[23:28.600 --> 23:28.840]  No.
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.140]  It sounds like you're talking to us from space.
[23:32.920 --> 23:33.140]  Really?
[23:34.140 --> 23:34.500]  Yeah.
[23:34.580 --> 23:35.160]  You got robot.
[23:35.920 --> 23:38.120]  Is it all these pictures of aliens that have done it?
[23:39.160 --> 23:40.440]  I'm trying to find them.
[23:42.820 --> 23:43.880]  Oh, my God.
[23:44.140 --> 23:44.820]  Stop talking.
[23:45.300 --> 23:45.680]  Oh, hang on.
[23:45.700 --> 23:47.340]  You're going to make Andrew into more of an alien.
[23:47.480 --> 23:48.080]  Gavin, stop.
[23:48.420 --> 23:49.600]  That's the one with the dick on it.
[23:49.660 --> 23:50.620]  You can see it's schlong.
[23:51.080 --> 23:51.240]  What?
[23:51.500 --> 23:52.120]  Oh, yeah.
[23:52.420 --> 23:53.820]  Look at his little wiener.
[23:53.940 --> 23:54.460]  Andrew, are you there?
[23:54.520 --> 23:54.920]  Are you an alien?
[23:56.080 --> 23:56.940]  How do I think?
[23:57.100 --> 23:57.440]  Uh-oh.
[23:57.520 --> 23:58.120]  Oh, boy.
[23:58.400 --> 23:58.980]  Uh-oh.
[24:00.500 --> 24:00.860]  Um...
[24:00.860 --> 24:02.280]  Are you trying to print something right now?
[24:02.360 --> 24:02.740]  Oh, he's gone.
[24:02.900 --> 24:03.380]  He's gone.
[24:03.800 --> 24:04.660]  What are you printing?
[24:05.340 --> 24:07.800]  It's been a while since we've had an Andrew tech problem.
[24:08.020 --> 24:08.180]  Yeah.
[24:08.180 --> 24:08.600]  It's true.
[24:09.900 --> 24:10.540]  Can you talk now?
[24:11.260 --> 24:11.820]  Andrew, are you there?
[24:13.160 --> 24:13.480]  Uh-oh.
[24:13.700 --> 24:14.060]  He...
[24:14.060 --> 24:14.400]  Oh, God.
[24:14.400 --> 24:18.940]  I want everyone at home to know, Andrew dropped from our call and immediately rejoined.
[24:19.100 --> 24:21.180]  We asked him to talk, and he has said nothing.
[24:21.460 --> 24:23.220]  So that means something broke.
[24:24.680 --> 24:25.720]  Oh, my God.
[24:25.920 --> 24:26.500]  Oh, no.
[24:26.760 --> 24:27.660]  Oh, God.
[24:28.300 --> 24:30.100]  This is how seasons change.
[24:31.420 --> 24:33.400]  Is this the end of the summer of 98?
[24:33.860 --> 24:34.060]  What?
[24:34.160 --> 24:35.000]  Yeah, definitely.
[24:37.500 --> 24:38.720]  I can't understand.
[24:39.600 --> 24:42.280]  This is the moment the summer of 98 ends.
[24:42.500 --> 24:44.380]  As of this moment, it's fall, y'all.
[24:45.080 --> 24:46.820]  It was such a good season.
[24:46.960 --> 24:48.900]  It was a great season, but we can't...
[24:48.900 --> 24:49.280]  Season, not yet.
[24:49.400 --> 24:49.760]  It was tremendous.
[24:50.140 --> 24:50.720]  It was one of my favorites.
[24:51.120 --> 24:56.260]  TPG asked me today, he just went, bro, when does the summer of 98 movie thing come out?
[24:56.480 --> 24:57.660]  And I went, what?
[24:58.360 --> 25:02.160]  And he said, yeah, recorded a thing for like the summer of 98, like, movie thing.
[25:02.200 --> 25:02.920]  When does that come out?
[25:02.980 --> 25:04.620]  And I went, like, a month ago?
[25:04.840 --> 25:05.580]  And he went, what?
[25:05.680 --> 25:05.940]  No.
[25:06.480 --> 25:07.180]  No, it didn't.
[25:07.980 --> 25:09.900]  What do you mean, no, it didn't?
[25:10.420 --> 25:13.620]  He couldn't believe that we included his whole thing at, like, the end.
[25:13.620 --> 25:15.480]  He was so excited about that.
[25:16.340 --> 25:16.880]  That's awesome.
[25:16.960 --> 25:17.940]  He's in town right now, right?
[25:18.060 --> 25:18.680]  Yeah, I talked to him.
[25:18.680 --> 25:19.560]  Yeah, I talked to him.
[25:19.600 --> 25:20.020]  I saw him today.
[25:20.140 --> 25:22.980]  I was going to try to swing by and see him in person, but I wasn't able to.
[25:22.980 --> 25:23.720]  I'm seeing him tonight.
[25:24.200 --> 25:26.480]  He told me to watch The Pope's Exorcist.
[25:28.800 --> 25:30.680]  That sounds like a very TPG thing to say.
[25:31.000 --> 25:32.960]  That was his Fuego recommendation.
[25:34.160 --> 25:34.480]  Fuego!
[25:40.160 --> 25:40.480]  Fuego!
[25:47.360 --> 25:48.340]  Oh, man.
[25:48.940 --> 25:50.180]  Hey, I got a...
[25:50.180 --> 25:50.440]  Oh, wait.
[25:50.560 --> 25:50.960]  Is that Andrew?
[25:51.380 --> 25:52.340]  No, that was him leaving.
[25:52.780 --> 25:54.980]  I have a little mini life hack for you guys.
[25:56.160 --> 25:56.480]  Yes.
[25:56.960 --> 25:58.680]  If you're ever bored...
[25:59.260 --> 26:02.820]  You know how sometimes you go stay in a hotel, like a really nice hotel, and you just get
[26:02.820 --> 26:04.260]  a really good night's sleep.
[26:05.300 --> 26:06.460]  It's a nice bed.
[26:06.640 --> 26:07.780]  It's a different bed or whatever.
[26:09.280 --> 26:13.500]  There's just something about being in a calm, new room in an unfamiliar bed, and you go
[26:13.500 --> 26:16.500]  to sleep, and you just wake up and you're like, I slept like a fucking rock in this
[26:16.500 --> 26:16.980]  hotel room.
[26:17.240 --> 26:19.880]  At least that happens to me a lot when I stay in hotel rooms.
[26:21.340 --> 26:26.360]  I figured out the other night, Emily and I, we were tickling each other in bed or something.
[26:26.460 --> 26:28.420]  Not sex, but just fucking annoying each other.
[26:28.460 --> 26:28.500]  What the fuck?
[26:29.560 --> 26:30.500]  Just fucking around.
[26:30.500 --> 26:34.060]  And I ended up on her side of the bed, and she on my side of the bed, and I was like,
[26:34.220 --> 26:35.260]  let's just sleep like this.
[26:35.320 --> 26:37.580]  And I'd never slept on her side of the bed before.
[26:38.360 --> 26:40.060]  I had the best fucking night of sleep.
[26:40.480 --> 26:45.220]  So my life hack is, if you ever get a little bored sleeping in your bedroom, sleep on
[26:45.220 --> 26:46.040]  the other side of the bed.
[26:46.180 --> 26:46.760]  Switch places.
[26:46.880 --> 26:47.760]  You might be surprised.
[26:47.980 --> 26:48.480]  It's fun.
[26:49.140 --> 26:50.440]  And you're not worried that you'll fall out?
[26:50.920 --> 26:51.860]  Fall out of bed?
[26:52.460 --> 26:56.020]  Yeah, because the drop is on a different side.
[26:56.400 --> 26:58.720]  Oh, like I'll think it's safe to roll in my sleep?
[26:58.720 --> 26:58.900]  Yeah.
[26:58.900 --> 27:00.920]  No, dude, I sleep like a vampire.
[27:01.360 --> 27:02.720]  I sleep like Dracula.
[27:03.300 --> 27:07.560]  Like, straight like a pencil, and with my arms folded at my chest.
[27:07.780 --> 27:12.140]  Like, exactly like Bela Lugosi rising from a crypt is how I sleep.
[27:12.280 --> 27:13.800]  And so I don't move at all.
[27:14.000 --> 27:19.180]  I had this conversation with my wife a month or two ago, and we both thought that
[27:19.180 --> 27:21.680]  it was insane to sleep on the other person's side of the bed.
[27:22.100 --> 27:25.460]  I would have never done it if I hadn't found myself on that and just was like
[27:25.460 --> 27:26.980]  feeling adventurous and was like, you know what, fuck it.
[27:27.440 --> 27:28.100]  Let's see what happens.
[27:28.100 --> 27:30.200]  I had a great night's sleep, and it was a lot of fun.
[27:30.300 --> 27:31.180]  And Emily did?
[27:31.820 --> 27:33.600]  Uh, I don't know. I didn't really ask her.
[27:35.960 --> 27:37.980]  No, she slept fine, too. We talked about it the next day.
[27:38.220 --> 27:40.020]  How did Emily sleep? I don't know. I don't give a fuck.
[27:40.280 --> 27:41.660]  Why would I give a shit about that?
[27:42.640 --> 27:45.080]  No, she also agreed that it was a good night's sleep.
[27:45.600 --> 27:48.320]  It wasn't as good a night's sleep for her because she sleeps on...
[27:48.320 --> 27:51.560]  She has like a fan on her... I explained her complicated sleep ritual.
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.220]  Oh, yeah, you'd be like all in her equipment.
[27:54.220 --> 27:59.880]  I was in between her and her equipment, which I think ultimately probably wasn't the best for her.
[28:00.220 --> 28:04.120]  But man, I see why she does it. I was fucking sleeping like a rock.
[28:04.660 --> 28:10.460]  After having spent some more time with your small wife, Eric, I can imagine her not being cool with switching sides.
[28:10.600 --> 28:15.820]  Yeah, she's just, you know, she's particular. She's specific.
[28:18.220 --> 28:20.780]  Sometimes you gotta throw caution to the wind and say fuck it.
[28:20.780 --> 28:23.300]  Okay, yeah, we're in different relationships.
[28:23.400 --> 28:28.160]  Fair enough. So a bad life hack, Eric?
[28:29.060 --> 28:34.320]  Yeah, I don't know. You also started this off by going, you know how you sleep so well in hotels?
[28:34.620 --> 28:35.860]  Oh, I sleep like dog shit.
[28:36.020 --> 28:37.520]  Yeah, I just kept thinking, no.
[28:38.060 --> 28:41.760]  Every once in a while when I go to a hotel, if I'm just there for a night or something,
[28:41.860 --> 28:47.780]  it's a decent, nice hotel with a big king-size bed and this room is super cold and it's pitch black
[28:47.780 --> 28:52.780]  because they have blackout curtains and you throw, like, CNN on quietly in the background or something.
[28:52.980 --> 28:58.520]  I just fucking go to... I sleep deep, like core-of-the-earth sleep.
[28:59.740 --> 29:03.140]  Like, I'm rolling around with slee-stacks in my sleep. I'm so fucking...
[29:03.140 --> 29:06.600]  Okay, but, like, you... do you...
[29:06.600 --> 29:08.260]  Gracie loves a hotel sleep, see?
[29:08.800 --> 29:16.340]  Great. What... what was your... but, like, you slept in, like, the army and stuff where it was, like...
[29:16.340 --> 29:19.760]  You know, you had to, like, really make something work, right?
[29:20.060 --> 29:24.160]  Oh, yeah. Do you want to hear the worst night of sleep in my life?
[29:24.500 --> 29:24.900]  Yes.
[29:25.380 --> 29:32.480]  I was... when I was in the army in 1994, I had...
[29:32.480 --> 29:35.320]  It was a bad year for me. I was deployed... maybe it was 95.
[29:35.480 --> 29:40.760]  I was deployed about eight months out of that year to Kuwait and to all different places.
[29:41.240 --> 29:47.400]  And so I had been gone almost the whole year, and I came home, and I was about to go...
[29:47.400 --> 29:50.520]  I came back home to Fort Hood, where I was stationed, and I went into work on a Monday.
[29:50.880 --> 29:54.160]  I had literally gotten home from Kuwait on Thursday, I think.
[29:54.860 --> 29:59.480]  And I had the weekend, and I got home Monday morning, and I was in a fucking great mood,
[29:59.620 --> 30:03.100]  because Wednesday I was going to go home to Alabama to see my family for Christmas.
[30:03.820 --> 30:07.300]  And so I just had, like, easy two days of work, and then I was, you know, on vacation.
[30:07.680 --> 30:12.460]  And I got into the office Monday morning, and my boss was there, and he goes...
[30:12.460 --> 30:14.120]  It was a really nice guy. I really liked him. He goes,
[30:14.180 --> 30:15.400]  Geoff, come here, son. And I go,
[30:15.720 --> 30:18.140]  Any time your boss calls you son, you know you're in for it.
[30:18.720 --> 30:20.060]  And I was like, in my head, I was like, what?
[30:20.240 --> 30:23.680]  I did a lot of dumb shit recently. What am I about to get in trouble for?
[30:24.380 --> 30:26.320]  And he goes, son, have a seat, okay?
[30:26.740 --> 30:28.300]  And he goes, I'm about to fuck you.
[30:28.600 --> 30:30.780]  And I was like, okay.
[30:30.900 --> 30:31.560]  So you undid your belt.
[30:32.520 --> 30:35.120]  Yeah, and I don't know if this is literal or what. I'm new to the army.
[30:35.460 --> 30:39.920]  And he goes, I really hate to do this to you, but you're getting deployed.
[30:40.160 --> 30:42.180]  And I laughed. I was like, no, I can't be getting deployed.
[30:42.240 --> 30:43.480]  I'm going home in two days. I'm on vacation.
[30:43.620 --> 30:45.000]  He goes, yeah, I had to rescind your leave.
[30:45.320 --> 30:46.000]  I'm really sorry.
[30:46.880 --> 30:51.120]  I need you to go on this important deployment.
[30:51.260 --> 30:55.660]  And I go, well, I have to call my mom and tell her I'm not coming home for Christmas.
[30:56.220 --> 31:00.320]  And he's like, yeah, you can do that, but you can't tell her where you're going.
[31:00.400 --> 31:02.180]  It's a secret mission, and you're not allowed to mention it.
[31:02.300 --> 31:04.020]  And so I was really pissed about that.
[31:04.020 --> 31:05.460]  And we were going to Panama.
[31:05.900 --> 31:07.560]  By the way, I'm telling this story to Vample.
[31:07.680 --> 31:09.240]  Andrew fixes his textbook.
[31:09.280 --> 31:10.320]  Am I fixed?
[31:10.960 --> 31:12.900]  So I can end the story.
[31:13.080 --> 31:14.500]  I'm not trying to take up the whole fucking episode.
[31:14.580 --> 31:15.720]  I was just trying to cover some time.
[31:16.260 --> 31:18.400]  But anyway, he goes, I gotta send you to Panama.
[31:18.600 --> 31:22.660]  What happened was a bunch of Haitian refugees left Haiti.
[31:22.660 --> 31:23.900]  And they ended up in Panama.
[31:24.200 --> 31:25.780]  And they didn't know what to do with them.
[31:25.840 --> 31:26.800]  So they built these...
[31:27.440 --> 31:29.020]  Honestly, like internment camps.
[31:29.020 --> 31:30.760]  It was kind of sketchy and scary.
[31:31.140 --> 31:33.680]  Just to kind of house them all and feed them and take care of them.
[31:33.740 --> 31:35.600]  While they figured out, do they have to go back to Haiti?
[31:35.880 --> 31:37.360]  Or do they assimilate into Panama?
[31:37.500 --> 31:37.800]  Or whatever.
[31:39.600 --> 31:41.760]  And so I had to call my mom in front of him.
[31:41.940 --> 31:43.780]  And tell her that I was going...
[31:43.780 --> 31:45.760]  Which is not a fun call you want to have with your mom.
[31:45.780 --> 31:47.600]  Two days before you're supposed to see her for Christmas.
[31:47.600 --> 31:48.960]  When you're 19 years old.
[31:49.020 --> 31:50.020]  And you've barely left home.
[31:50.560 --> 31:52.820]  And say, I have to go out of the country.
[31:52.880 --> 31:53.860]  I'm not coming home for Christmas.
[31:54.120 --> 31:55.960]  And I'm not allowed to say where I'm going.
[31:56.120 --> 31:57.320]  And my mom just starts crying.
[31:57.320 --> 31:59.020]  And she's like, oh Geoffrey, oh no.
[31:59.180 --> 32:00.800]  And I go, yeah, my boss...
[32:00.800 --> 32:02.720]  He won't let me say where I'm going.
[32:02.880 --> 32:04.920]  But he didn't say I can't rhyme it.
[32:05.760 --> 32:07.080]  It rhymes with Manama.
[32:07.340 --> 32:09.080]  I'm going to a place that rhymes with Manama.
[32:09.940 --> 32:11.440]  And he just fucking...
[32:11.440 --> 32:13.840]  His fucking steam came out of his ears.
[32:14.180 --> 32:15.360]  This was right in front of him?
[32:15.640 --> 32:16.600]  Yeah, it was right in front of him.
[32:17.800 --> 32:18.520]  You idiot.
[32:19.200 --> 32:20.580]  I don't give a fuck, dude. I was mad.
[32:21.700 --> 32:24.020]  And anyway, he just let it go.
[32:24.140 --> 32:25.540]  I saw him settle himself.
[32:25.540 --> 32:26.980]  He did the...
[32:27.700 --> 32:29.280]  Stuff it down, stuff it down.
[32:29.620 --> 32:30.860]  And then he goes, okay.
[32:31.180 --> 32:32.120]  And so I get off the phone with my mom.
[32:32.160 --> 32:33.040]  And I go, where am I going?
[32:33.300 --> 32:35.620]  And he goes, that's the other thing.
[32:35.860 --> 32:38.120]  You need to go pack. You're leaving in like four hours.
[32:38.900 --> 32:40.460]  So I immediately went home.
[32:40.540 --> 32:41.800]  And luckily I had done laundry.
[32:41.940 --> 32:44.120]  Because all my laundry was fucking full of sand from Kuwait.
[32:44.440 --> 32:45.920]  And so I had just done laundry over the weekend.
[32:46.300 --> 32:48.120]  And so I packed up and I went to Panama.
[32:48.660 --> 32:49.400]  Then I get to Panama.
[32:49.520 --> 32:51.280]  I don't really know what's going to happen when I get there.
[32:51.280 --> 32:53.940]  We're staying on the fucking Panama Canal.
[32:54.180 --> 32:56.960]  Like, I'm looking at the Panama Canal from my tent.
[32:57.460 --> 32:58.400]  And, uh...
[32:58.400 --> 32:59.580]  Worst night of sleep of my life.
[33:00.020 --> 33:03.840]  It's not like 140% humidity in Panama somehow.
[33:04.320 --> 33:04.980]  All year round.
[33:05.060 --> 33:07.100]  Like, it's like walking through a shower at all times.
[33:07.460 --> 33:12.040]  And the bugs on the Panama Canal are the size of Eric's dog.
[33:13.420 --> 33:14.380]  And, uh...
[33:14.380 --> 33:16.820]  Also, by the way, we got there and all of our food spoiled.
[33:17.020 --> 33:19.780]  And so the army didn't have food for fucking three days.
[33:20.120 --> 33:20.720]  Like, I didn't get to eat.
[33:20.840 --> 33:21.260]  We fucked up.
[33:23.100 --> 33:24.340]  But that's a different story.
[33:24.600 --> 33:26.240]  So anyway, we set up these tents.
[33:26.680 --> 33:27.860]  These big open air tents.
[33:27.980 --> 33:29.760]  Right on the Panama Canal.
[33:30.340 --> 33:31.800]  Which I'm like, are there alligators?
[33:31.960 --> 33:33.040]  Are they going to come eat me in my sleep?
[33:33.100 --> 33:34.440]  Because I can fucking see the water from here.
[33:34.500 --> 33:35.380]  This doesn't seem safe.
[33:35.820 --> 33:38.780]  But we set up these mosquito nets.
[33:39.380 --> 33:40.700]  Because there were fucking bugs everywhere.
[33:40.860 --> 33:41.680]  And then I went to sleep.
[33:42.080 --> 33:45.060]  And as soon as it gets dark and everybody goes to sleep...
[33:45.060 --> 33:46.680]  The monkeys come out.
[33:47.040 --> 33:49.420]  And the monkeys start screaming.
[33:50.100 --> 33:51.060]  And yelling.
[33:51.420 --> 33:52.140]  And fighting.
[33:52.400 --> 33:53.620]  And attacking each other.
[33:53.980 --> 33:56.880]  And destroying all of our stuff.
[33:57.680 --> 33:58.820]  And you could hear it.
[33:58.880 --> 34:00.140]  The monkeys are like...
[34:00.140 --> 34:02.860]  It's terrifying to hear a monkey in pitch black.
[34:03.100 --> 34:04.740]  And it's even worse to hear like...
[34:04.740 --> 34:05.860]  I don't know, maybe 50 of them.
[34:06.360 --> 34:07.220]  Is what it sounds like.
[34:07.660 --> 34:12.980]  And so I had to sleep through bugs biting me every second.
[34:13.480 --> 34:15.900]  And monkeys screaming in my ear all night long.
[34:16.180 --> 34:18.040]  Praying that a monkey doesn't come and eat me.
[34:18.920 --> 34:21.080]  And that was like the longest night of my life.
[34:21.200 --> 34:22.540]  And when I got up in the morning...
[34:22.540 --> 34:25.820]  I was covered in bug bites from head to toe.
[34:26.400 --> 34:28.340]  Like a horror movie.
[34:29.160 --> 34:30.160]  Like what Chet...
[34:30.160 --> 34:32.980]  Do you remember Bill Pullman?
[34:34.860 --> 34:36.900]  Yeah, Bill Pullman in Weird Science.
[34:37.340 --> 34:41.360]  When she turns him into like a big blob of...
[34:41.360 --> 34:42.700]  Essentially like a big zit.
[34:42.980 --> 34:44.660]  That's what my whole fucking body looked like.
[34:45.060 --> 34:46.980]  And so that's the worst night of sleep of my life.
[34:46.980 --> 34:47.960]  Sleeping on the Panama Canal.
[34:48.820 --> 34:50.020]  Being terrified of monkeys.
[34:50.420 --> 34:52.420]  And getting malaria six or seven times.
[34:53.680 --> 34:54.540]  Yeah, that's what I look like.
[34:54.600 --> 34:55.580]  That's what I look like right there.
[34:56.080 --> 34:57.200]  What? Dog shit night of sleep?
[34:57.600 --> 34:58.140]  That's terrible.
[35:03.040 --> 35:05.240]  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[35:05.760 --> 35:08.420]  There are so many times where...
[35:08.420 --> 35:10.940]  Doing something that would be good for me.
[35:11.020 --> 35:12.360]  Whether it be sleep or...
[35:12.980 --> 35:14.180]  Eating something, whatever.
[35:14.520 --> 35:15.620]  Could be all sorts of things.
[35:16.260 --> 35:18.580]  Is good but not always the easiest to pick.
[35:18.580 --> 35:21.500]  I mean, do you ever feel like your brain is getting in its own way?
[35:21.580 --> 35:23.080]  I know for me, with sleep.
[35:23.480 --> 35:24.820]  That happens all the time.
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.520]  Where it would be like, oh, I really need to get up early.
[35:27.720 --> 35:28.780]  Or whatever the next day.
[35:29.100 --> 35:30.400]  And it just won't happen.
[35:30.860 --> 35:32.460]  My mind will constantly be racing.
[35:32.620 --> 35:34.200]  I'll be having all sorts of different thoughts.
[35:34.440 --> 35:36.100]  It's really frustrating.
[35:36.480 --> 35:38.120]  Something that I've gotten better with over time.
[35:38.760 --> 35:41.340]  It feels like, I don't know if it's an anxiety thing.
[35:41.440 --> 35:43.360]  But whenever there's something like that.
[35:43.440 --> 35:44.760]  Where I have to...
[35:45.260 --> 35:47.580]  Do something for the betterment of myself.
[35:47.580 --> 35:50.260]  I sabotage in some ways.
[35:51.060 --> 35:52.060]  Like, you know what you should do.
[35:52.100 --> 35:52.640]  What's good for you.
[35:52.680 --> 35:53.680]  But you just can't do it.
[35:53.980 --> 35:56.000]  Therapy helps you figure out what's holding you back.
[35:56.160 --> 35:58.960]  So you can work for yourself instead of against yourself.
[35:59.740 --> 36:01.500]  Therapy is something that has helped me.
[36:01.600 --> 36:02.560]  As I say every time.
[36:02.620 --> 36:03.840]  Because it's true in so many ways.
[36:03.940 --> 36:05.740]  It's still something that helps.
[36:06.740 --> 36:08.520]  Really has led to me to discover.
[36:09.280 --> 36:11.760]  Not just things that I'm struggling with.
[36:12.040 --> 36:12.960]  That I knew about.
[36:13.040 --> 36:14.380]  But also things I didn't know about.
[36:14.380 --> 36:16.900]  And ways to kind of approach those things.
[36:18.260 --> 36:19.960]  And has just helped me.
[36:20.320 --> 36:21.360]  Deal with issues.
[36:21.540 --> 36:24.060]  In ways that I would have never naturally come to.
[36:24.480 --> 36:26.580]  Or even viewed in the right lens.
[36:27.000 --> 36:30.080]  I think it's an amazing process to go through.
[36:30.180 --> 36:31.360]  So I'd recommend anyone do it.
[36:31.900 --> 36:33.580]  If you're thinking of starting therapy.

[38:21.660 --> 38:22.560]  You guys have a bad night of sleep?
[38:23.960 --> 38:24.960]  Mine's not very funny.
[38:25.360 --> 38:28.360]  Yeah, definitely nothing close to that.
[38:28.540 --> 38:29.420]  Yeah, nothing.
[38:29.420 --> 38:30.560]  Nothing remotely.
[38:31.600 --> 38:32.700]  Andrew, you sound good now.
[38:33.000 --> 38:33.620]  I sound good?
[38:34.360 --> 38:37.400]  You should have heard me yell when I went to message Nick.
[38:37.580 --> 38:39.800]  To help me with this tech support thing.
[38:40.180 --> 38:42.000]  Realizing my phone has nothing on it.
[38:42.360 --> 38:43.900]  I opened it to a blank phone.
[38:44.200 --> 38:45.420]  I hate Google so much.
[38:45.660 --> 38:47.040]  It just instilled my rage.
[38:47.400 --> 38:48.200]  Even further.
[38:51.100 --> 38:53.440]  It's just been a bad tech thing for me.
[38:53.500 --> 38:54.840]  I do have a thing when I sleep.
[38:55.020 --> 38:57.140]  When you get woken up.
[38:58.000 --> 38:58.520]  Unexpectedly.
[38:58.540 --> 39:00.200]  Do you immediately go into
[39:00.800 --> 39:02.520]  attack or suspicious mode?
[39:02.660 --> 39:04.400]  How do you react typically when that happens?
[39:04.880 --> 39:06.100]  If somebody wakes you up.
[39:06.960 --> 39:09.380]  Typically, my whole life I've been like this.
[39:09.420 --> 39:10.620]  When I get woken up unexpectedly.
[39:10.860 --> 39:13.220]  I'm always immediately very accusatory.
[39:13.680 --> 39:15.580]  Assuming that something awful is happening.
[39:16.100 --> 39:17.120]  Do you get mad?
[39:17.780 --> 39:19.860]  Not mad at the person.
[39:20.060 --> 39:20.780]  But mad that
[39:21.360 --> 39:23.260]  there must be some situation
[39:23.260 --> 39:25.120]  that is causing this that is not good.
[39:25.120 --> 39:26.680]  It's a lot of...
[39:27.600 --> 39:28.920]  Why are you...
[39:28.920 --> 39:30.200]  Why is this happening?
[39:30.440 --> 39:31.600]  Is sort of the general
[39:33.140 --> 39:35.100]  thought I have when I get woken up.
[39:35.580 --> 39:36.580]  It happens a lot.
[39:36.700 --> 39:38.580]  I had it happen recently.
[39:39.600 --> 39:41.120]  I've been really into Party Animals.
[39:41.500 --> 39:42.360]  Which just came out.
[39:42.660 --> 39:44.020]  It's a great game. It's a lot of fun.
[39:45.280 --> 39:46.560]  It's like Gang Beasts.
[39:46.760 --> 39:48.560]  But with really cute characters.
[39:48.740 --> 39:50.320]  And I would say more fun in my opinion.
[39:51.080 --> 39:53.060]  There's all these skins and stuff.
[39:53.980 --> 39:54.340]  And...
[39:55.420 --> 39:56.680]  Eric says, do you want to play it on Let's Play?
[39:56.720 --> 39:57.980]  Absolutely, I want to play it on Let's Play.
[39:58.800 --> 40:00.700]  I'm so excited to play that with you guys.
[40:00.780 --> 40:01.780]  It's so much fun and chaotic.
[40:02.480 --> 40:04.360]  It's great. But they have all these skins.
[40:04.920 --> 40:06.820]  And a lot of games now do like
[40:06.820 --> 40:09.160]  Twitch integration with their stuff.
[40:09.300 --> 40:11.280]  Where like, either if you're streaming
[40:11.280 --> 40:12.700]  you get like additional things.
[40:13.080 --> 40:15.440]  Or in this case, it was you had to watch
[40:16.120 --> 40:17.500]  streamers that had like a certain
[40:18.280 --> 40:19.640]  credit to their account.
[40:19.900 --> 40:21.300]  And if you watch for an hour
[40:21.300 --> 40:22.940]  you would get one thing. And then an hour more
[40:22.940 --> 40:25.400]  you'd get another thing. And they had like five things including a skin.
[40:25.900 --> 40:27.240]  So I thought, I'll just set this up.
[40:27.920 --> 40:29.360]  And it went to Steam
[40:29.360 --> 40:31.000]  which doesn't even connect to Xbox
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.240]  they found out. So there's no reason for me to do this.
[40:33.300 --> 40:35.400]  I have no access to the things that I was
[40:35.400 --> 40:37.040]  getting. But I was just
[40:37.460 --> 40:39.340]  watching Twitch streamers that had the credit
[40:39.340 --> 40:41.000]  and then whenever I hit enough time
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.380]  I'd hit approve. And that was sort of my evening
[40:43.380 --> 40:43.860]  that night.
[40:45.700 --> 40:47.540]  Everything's muted. I went to bed.
[40:48.080 --> 40:49.800]  And then at 3.45
[40:49.800 --> 40:51.560]  a.m. I just
[40:51.560 --> 40:53.800]  start hearing yelling. I'm just
[40:53.800 --> 40:55.780]  hearing a voice yelling. And I
[40:55.780 --> 40:57.520]  immediately go into defense mode.
[40:57.680 --> 41:00.200]  I think like, is there somebody screaming outside?
[41:00.560 --> 41:01.660]  What is going on?
[41:01.820 --> 41:03.620]  And so I hear the voice. I wake up. I go
[41:03.620 --> 41:05.740]  I say like, what is, why is this
[41:05.740 --> 41:07.700]  happening? Why is this happening? To my
[41:07.700 --> 41:09.540]  partner in bed. And then I yell
[41:09.540 --> 41:11.600]  what do you want? And I realize
[41:11.600 --> 41:13.420]  what had happened is
[41:13.420 --> 41:15.720]  when you have Twitch muted for a
[41:15.720 --> 41:17.860]  streamer, it will unmute them
[41:17.860 --> 41:19.520]  if it goes to a different account.
[41:20.080 --> 41:22.260]  So the person that I left it on
[41:22.260 --> 41:23.860]  running for, they
[41:23.860 --> 41:25.720]  stopped streaming at 3.45
[41:25.720 --> 41:28.220]  a.m. my time, went to a different streamer
[41:28.220 --> 41:29.720]  and it was just this woman
[41:29.720 --> 41:31.920]  reading off her recent subscriber list
[41:31.920 --> 41:34.200]  at full volume on my computer.
[41:34.480 --> 41:35.880]  But I thought that there was
[41:35.880 --> 41:37.940]  like an attack going on or that like somebody
[41:37.940 --> 41:39.820]  had broken into the space. I was
[41:39.820 --> 41:41.460]  so confused and angry.
[41:42.020 --> 41:43.880]  I was just yelling. That was a pretty bad
[41:43.880 --> 41:45.920]  night of sleep. Me yelling at my
[41:45.920 --> 41:47.880]  computer what do you want when it's just a
[41:47.880 --> 41:49.800]  Twitch streamer reading like thanks for the follow
[41:49.800 --> 41:51.920]  up. Auto unmute might be the
[41:51.920 --> 41:54.120]  worst feature I've ever heard. It's terrible.
[41:54.380 --> 41:55.900]  It's a terrible feature. It should not be
[41:55.900 --> 41:56.720]  a thing that exists.
[41:58.020 --> 41:59.800]  I wake up to, because I
[41:59.800 --> 42:01.700]  just fall asleep to YouTube videos a lot of the time.
[42:02.080 --> 42:03.920]  And it puts me down some
[42:03.920 --> 42:05.900]  really weird YouTube holes. But I kind of
[42:05.900 --> 42:08.000]  just the next night I'll just click on whatever's on the recommended
[42:08.000 --> 42:09.860]  so at the moment it's just like police
[42:09.860 --> 42:11.860]  interrogation videos. Something about
[42:11.860 --> 42:13.960]  the audio being so shit it puts me
[42:13.960 --> 42:16.120]  right to sleep. I don't really ever know what they're being interviewed
[42:16.120 --> 42:16.460]  about.
[42:18.200 --> 42:20.120]  Gavin finds police interrogating
[42:20.120 --> 42:21.840]  murderers to be calming and soothing.
[42:21.860 --> 42:23.980]  I don't know if they're murderers. I don't know. They're all
[42:23.980 --> 42:26.040]  murderers. I only ever hear the first
[42:26.040 --> 42:27.760]  like eight minutes of it. But
[42:27.760 --> 42:29.960]  it always like auto plays onto like
[42:29.960 --> 42:32.060]  a live car chase. Like a
[42:32.060 --> 42:34.140]  three hour video of just like helicopters
[42:34.140 --> 42:34.940]  reporting on
[42:35.680 --> 42:37.800]  where cars are. And that's also very
[42:37.800 --> 42:39.920]  peaceful I've found. Because sometimes I'll wake up
[42:39.920 --> 42:42.040]  to like talking
[42:42.040 --> 42:44.120]  about where the car went. And it just puts
[42:44.120 --> 42:44.920]  me right back to sleep.
[42:47.040 --> 42:48.100]  I'm imagining you
[42:48.100 --> 42:50.120]  sleeping in a race car bed while listening
[42:50.120 --> 42:51.920]  to voices of people saying where
[42:51.920 --> 42:54.120]  the car went. Like you're dreaming that you're driving around.
[42:55.120 --> 42:56.000]  Causing crimes.
[42:57.300 --> 42:58.140]  I have a question
[42:58.140 --> 42:59.920]  for you Geoff. Okay I have an answer
[42:59.920 --> 43:02.260]  I probably have an answer for you. I think you have an answer.
[43:03.280 --> 43:04.160]  Is it
[43:04.160 --> 43:05.940]  about snow runners and how I spent
[43:05.940 --> 43:08.200]  fucking five hours last night trying to move
[43:08.200 --> 43:09.920]  concrete slabs from the dam at
[43:09.920 --> 43:12.180]  Smithville. Or the quarry by the dam
[43:12.180 --> 43:13.640]  at Smithville all the way up to Big Lake.
[43:13.960 --> 43:15.640]  Yes it was fucking brutal.
[43:16.420 --> 43:17.620]  What is snow runners?
[43:18.300 --> 43:19.560]  It's the game I play every night.
[43:20.020 --> 43:21.960]  You're playing snow runners? Is that like
[43:21.960 --> 43:24.220]  the truck game? Yeah every night of my life man.
[43:24.600 --> 43:25.860]  I think I've played snow runners.
[43:26.320 --> 43:27.080]  Oh my god.
[43:28.660 --> 43:29.540]  Just haul
[43:29.540 --> 43:31.780]  freight. I mean that sounds like someone
[43:31.780 --> 43:32.340]  we should play.
[43:32.900 --> 43:35.840]  I was talking about it with my
[43:35.840 --> 43:37.800]  dudes last night. And I don't know if y'all
[43:37.800 --> 43:40.180]  are ready for snow runners. I really don't.
[43:40.260 --> 43:41.800]  I don't know. Wait so you got
[43:41.800 --> 43:43.860]  like a truck crew? Is everybody doing snow
[43:43.860 --> 43:45.860]  runners right now? Just my crew
[43:45.860 --> 43:47.800]  just me and my two dudes that I play video games with.
[43:47.800 --> 43:49.740]  That's what I love. So you guys are in a multiplayer
[43:49.740 --> 43:51.440]  session just running freight.
[43:51.760 --> 43:54.160]  Every night from 10am until about 3am.
[43:54.420 --> 43:55.840]  I know last night was a school
[43:55.840 --> 43:57.840]  night and I wasn't supposed to play late but I could sleep
[43:57.840 --> 43:59.640]  in a little bit today. And so I
[43:59.640 --> 44:01.860]  allowed myself to play until 3. So does that
[44:01.860 --> 44:03.440]  potentially mean that Andrew and I should
[44:03.920 --> 44:05.840]  start playing it separately to get
[44:05.840 --> 44:07.600]  up to the level where we could potentially
[44:08.140 --> 44:09.780]  fit in with what
[44:09.780 --> 44:10.220]  you're doing?
[44:13.120 --> 44:13.920]  I mean...
[44:13.920 --> 44:15.700]  Getting trained up on running cargo.
[44:16.220 --> 44:17.380]  I just don't know if you guys
[44:17.380 --> 44:19.880]  I'm not trying to be rude but it's a lot
[44:19.880 --> 44:21.880]  it's hard. It's a lot of work. No it is really hard.
[44:21.960 --> 44:23.920]  I think I played it and I couldn't figure out how to shift
[44:23.920 --> 44:25.720]  gear. So it's just driving around
[44:25.720 --> 44:27.540]  really slow for like 12 minutes. So is it like ultra
[44:27.540 --> 44:29.720]  realistic? No it's not ultra
[44:29.720 --> 44:31.780]  but there's a learning curve
[44:31.780 --> 44:33.880]  and there's a rhythm to it
[44:33.880 --> 44:35.760]  It's slow and steady
[44:35.760 --> 44:37.740]  Like I'm not kidding when I say I spent
[44:38.200 --> 44:39.620]  I mean some of it was cause of
[44:39.620 --> 44:41.920]  the game being a piece of shit and crashing
[44:41.920 --> 44:43.640]  but I spent about 3 hours
[44:44.120 --> 44:45.960]  literally just going from one side of the
[44:45.960 --> 44:47.200]  map to the other and
[44:47.700 --> 44:49.060]  getting stuck and having to be
[44:49.680 --> 44:51.840]  wedged out by one of the other dudes and vice versa
[44:51.840 --> 44:52.580]  but yeah it's
[44:53.780 --> 44:55.980]  If you're gonna do it you should definitely
[44:55.980 --> 44:57.740]  play it and we'll see
[44:57.740 --> 45:00.100]  I don't know that it makes for content
[45:00.100 --> 45:01.360]  but it might
[45:01.360 --> 45:06.480]  I will show you one thing though. Here, I'm going to send you guys a photo. And while I'm doing
[45:06.480 --> 45:12.140]  that, Andrew, why don't you ask me... My question. Yeah. My question, Geoff, is...
[45:12.920 --> 45:18.440]  It's okay if you say no to this. I'm just curious where your mind goes. If you were on, let's say,
[45:18.520 --> 45:23.060]  another podcast. Say you're a guest on another podcast. And somebody asked,
[45:23.560 --> 45:29.080]  who's the funniest person you know? Would either of us come up in that conversation?
[45:29.720 --> 45:33.480]  As even like a passing mention. Somebody from this podcast would.
[45:33.860 --> 45:37.980]  I just can't imagine answering that question without at least bringing you or Gavin up.
[45:40.900 --> 45:46.680]  My initial response would be to say, I'm the funniest person I've ever met.
[45:47.440 --> 45:49.320]  You get all your own jokes. Have you met yourself?
[45:50.100 --> 45:57.980]  Yeah, I get all my own jokes. I really tickle me. I'm an audience of one and I love it. No,
[45:57.980 --> 46:02.160]  I think you and Gavin are easily two of the funniest people I've ever met. And I've met a lot.
[46:02.220 --> 46:09.540]  I've been blessed in and outside of this career to be around some very, very funny people.
[46:09.900 --> 46:13.880]  I'd say the same thing about you and Gavin. I thought that was interesting. I wanted to
[46:13.880 --> 46:15.600]  see if we're on the same page with that. That's all I'm going to say.
[46:15.760 --> 46:18.760]  You guys would be... I mean, I've never thought to rank it.
[46:19.240 --> 46:20.260]  I think... No, neither have I.
[46:20.480 --> 46:24.520]  I don't... I mean, you guys are both funny in very different ways. I think you're equally funny.
[46:24.520 --> 46:32.100]  But you're also like... You delight me. Like, I do a podcast with you guys because
[46:32.100 --> 46:37.520]  I'm so entertained by both of you and how hilarious I think you both are.
[46:37.660 --> 46:40.680]  So I don't know who I would put in front of you, honestly.
[46:41.160 --> 46:45.540]  Yeah, I feel like funniest person, if I was asked that, it would definitely be a pool of people.
[46:45.920 --> 46:46.100]  Well, you were. But if...
[46:46.680 --> 46:49.660]  You were and we weren't on the list. So that's why I was bringing this up.
[46:49.680 --> 46:52.260]  I just want to make sure Geoff and I were on the same page here.
[46:52.260 --> 46:54.340]  You're talking about us always open?
[46:54.700 --> 47:00.220]  Well, you were asked the question and we did not come up once or even a thought of bringing this up.
[47:00.220 --> 47:00.720]  I didn't say anyone, did I?
[47:00.820 --> 47:04.320]  I thought I would immediately... No, you did. You absolutely did.
[47:05.300 --> 47:08.900]  Not us. So I just want to make sure Geoff and I were on the same page that we would include you.
[47:09.120 --> 47:09.960]  Yeah, I would include Gavin.
[47:10.020 --> 47:10.540]  What did I say?
[47:10.900 --> 47:15.900]  We're not on his list, Geoff. You said the Willems. You didn't mention us.
[47:16.320 --> 47:18.040]  Wow, get fucked us.
[47:18.040 --> 47:22.560]  Yeah, no, it was a... I thought maybe a throwaway or like not even...
[47:22.560 --> 47:24.340]  I'm not even want to be at the top of the list.
[47:24.420 --> 47:27.680]  I just thought like a mention would have been nice for us, but it's OK.
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.560]  All right. To be honest, I was trying not to shit myself. The whole thing's a blur.
[47:31.160 --> 47:36.420]  So, Gav, I guess what you're saying is if you had the opportunity to fire Andrew and I
[47:36.420 --> 47:39.220]  and replace us on F*** Face with the Willems, you would do that?
[47:39.900 --> 47:41.860]  No, I think I was just saying that at least it's very funny.
[47:42.920 --> 47:44.900]  They're... Yeah, they... I'm not going to argue with you.
[47:44.900 --> 47:46.080]  No, they're definitely funny.
[47:46.080 --> 47:48.320]  Absolutely deserving of it.
[47:48.380 --> 47:52.620]  I just thought I was curious what you would say, Geoff, because I know what I would say.
[47:52.780 --> 47:53.780]  And I know what Gav would say.
[47:55.780 --> 47:59.440]  Yeah, you guys would you guys would probably... I'd probably mention you,
[48:00.060 --> 48:04.020]  you two and Bernie, honestly, as the funniest people I've ever met.
[48:04.040 --> 48:07.420]  I just thought that Gavin phrased that like he was going to answer it like he hadn't already.
[48:08.040 --> 48:09.540]  I was very happy.
[48:09.980 --> 48:11.700]  But what is this? So you have a...
[48:11.700 --> 48:13.260]  So let me show you in a truck.
[48:13.580 --> 48:14.400]  It's me in a truck.
[48:14.400 --> 48:20.780]  And you can see to the right of the truck, there's a yellow square, like a yellow square.
[48:21.240 --> 48:25.060]  That's where I need to turn in that cargo I have in the back of my truck.
[48:25.900 --> 48:27.980]  That is where I ran out of gas.
[48:28.660 --> 48:29.140]  No!
[48:29.960 --> 48:35.060]  Have you ever seen somebody get closer to an objective and run out of gas
[48:35.060 --> 48:36.480]  and not be able to complete it?
[48:36.740 --> 48:40.300]  Now, the problem with this was I was in a different part of the map.
[48:40.740 --> 48:44.340]  Antonio, my friend Antonio, had to come bring me gas and fill my car up.
[48:45.040 --> 48:46.240]  He couldn't just give you a nudge?
[48:47.240 --> 48:49.260]  Well, I mean, he's got to get to me either way.
[48:49.680 --> 48:53.000]  So he has to get from... so they have to get from where they are to me.
[48:53.320 --> 48:54.540]  It's 45 minutes.
[48:54.800 --> 49:00.560]  So basically, I got there, ran out of gas six feet from finishing the mission,
[49:00.680 --> 49:04.200]  and then I had to wait about 45 minutes for them to bring gas.
[49:04.240 --> 49:05.060]  Real time?
[49:05.440 --> 49:07.480]  Yeah, probably half hour, yeah, of real time.
[49:07.500 --> 49:08.260]  How big's this map?
[49:08.580 --> 49:09.120]  They're big.
[49:09.260 --> 49:10.920]  Well, it's not just that it's big, it's hard.
[49:11.040 --> 49:12.700]  It's fucking hard to traverse, dude.
[49:12.700 --> 49:15.380]  It's muddy, it's fucking... you're rolling over.
[49:15.600 --> 49:17.320]  They're trying to get to me and they're getting stuck,
[49:17.400 --> 49:19.300]  and then one of them has to go get a crane to get them out.
[49:19.360 --> 49:20.300]  It's a fucking thing.
[49:20.820 --> 49:24.800]  But I couldn't... I laughed probably for 15 straight minutes last night
[49:24.800 --> 49:27.500]  when I literally ran out of gas right there.
[49:28.780 --> 49:29.660]  That's unbelievable.
[49:30.040 --> 49:32.480]  How many minutes had you been driving?
[49:33.200 --> 49:34.420]  It was worse than that.
[49:34.960 --> 49:39.260]  So what happens is, the way it works is one person opens up a multiplayer session
[49:39.260 --> 49:42.260]  so it's in their world, and then you join their world.
[49:43.280 --> 49:47.420]  And their world persists, but your part of it doesn't.
[49:47.500 --> 49:51.980]  So if I bring one of my trucks in and I drive around, if I leave, that truck disappears.
[49:53.880 --> 49:59.800]  So it was a very simple mission where I go and I get the stuff from the quarry
[49:59.800 --> 50:03.920]  and then I just have to drive it across a fucking dam and a whole bunch of stuff
[50:03.920 --> 50:07.300]  over a mountain to another part of the map.
[50:07.380 --> 50:09.480]  You have to load into another section of the map.
[50:09.600 --> 50:11.400]  That in itself could take a half hour, 45 minutes.
[50:11.400 --> 50:16.860]  But what kept happening to us last night is I'd get about five-eighths of the way through it
[50:16.860 --> 50:18.160]  and get kicked from the game.
[50:18.500 --> 50:21.420]  And when you get kicked from the game, all your progress just disappears.
[50:21.760 --> 50:24.400]  So the truck just goes away.
[50:24.560 --> 50:28.700]  And so then when you come back in, I have to respawn at the spawn point
[50:28.700 --> 50:33.560]  and then spend a half an hour, 45 minutes getting to the spot to get the hull
[50:33.560 --> 50:35.020]  and then take it up again.
[50:35.220 --> 50:39.280]  I got kicked, I think, three times before I was able to turn it in.
[50:39.280 --> 50:42.280]  And so this point right here, when I'm right at the edge,
[50:42.380 --> 50:43.580]  I've already been kicked from the game.
[50:43.660 --> 50:47.320]  I've already lost probably an hour and a half of my life trying to turn this in.
[50:47.640 --> 50:51.880]  And I now have to wait 30 to 45 minutes for them to bring gas to me
[50:51.880 --> 50:55.220]  and just pray that I don't get kicked in the meantime.
[50:55.500 --> 50:59.580]  Oh, I just I pulled it up.
[50:59.660 --> 51:00.620]  I have played this game.
[51:00.680 --> 51:02.540]  It was absolutely the game that I loaded in.
[51:02.620 --> 51:07.680]  I think I got the truck stuck and then I just closed it after like 20 minutes.
[51:07.740 --> 51:08.320]  It was a lot.
[51:08.320 --> 51:09.700]  There's a definite curve.
[51:10.340 --> 51:11.640]  It's so fucking much fun.
[51:11.760 --> 51:13.060]  And we definitely should play it sometime.
[51:13.240 --> 51:14.000]  But it's a slow...
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.420]  I mean, if we're going to play it, we got to play it for like three hours.
[51:17.080 --> 51:18.900]  So you guys got to buckle up.
[51:19.680 --> 51:20.320]  I'm ready for that.
[51:20.420 --> 51:21.000]  I'm up for it.
[51:21.360 --> 51:21.560]  Okay.
[51:21.700 --> 51:21.880]  Yeah.
[51:21.880 --> 51:22.920]  Well, we'll look into it.
[51:23.080 --> 51:23.560]  Definitely, for sure.
[51:23.680 --> 51:25.040]  I mean, I don't want to butt in on your...
[51:25.900 --> 51:26.820]  You're not butting in on anything.
[51:27.460 --> 51:31.320]  I think they would be entertained to see other people play the game
[51:31.320 --> 51:33.880]  because I think we're the only three people on Earth that are playing this game.
[51:35.380 --> 51:36.840]  It's on Game Pass too, which is great.
[51:37.220 --> 51:37.760]  Yeah, it's free.
[51:38.360 --> 51:39.260]  What is the...
[51:39.260 --> 51:39.940]  What's the name of it?
[51:40.260 --> 51:40.920]  Snow Runner.
[51:41.640 --> 51:42.520]  Snow Runner?
[51:42.740 --> 51:42.980]  Okay.
[51:43.400 --> 51:43.620]  Yeah.
[51:44.680 --> 51:49.600]  You start in Michigan and you just complete missions in Michigan, you know,
[51:49.700 --> 51:55.080]  fixing bridges and hauling lumber and concrete slabs and bricks and shit.
[51:55.160 --> 51:56.360]  And then you make your way to Alaska.
[51:57.040 --> 51:57.840]  And then you can go to...
[51:57.840 --> 52:00.220]  There's like 10 DLC places you can go.
[52:00.480 --> 52:01.880]  So you can go all over the place.
[52:02.240 --> 52:02.700]  I'm excited.
[52:02.940 --> 52:06.560]  We're going to record a Tony Hawk thing after this that I think will be a lot of fun.
[52:06.560 --> 52:10.060]  I got kicked out of my Sea of Thieves account last night.
[52:10.140 --> 52:11.840]  It took me like five hours to figure that out.
[52:11.900 --> 52:13.240]  But I'd love to do Sea of Thieves stuff.
[52:13.400 --> 52:13.880]  What happened?
[52:14.240 --> 52:17.200]  It just... I kept getting this error called lavender beard.
[52:17.420 --> 52:18.560]  It wouldn't let me load in.
[52:18.720 --> 52:24.100]  And then it's a kind of annoying thing where every support thing I found was for people on PC.
[52:25.040 --> 52:27.380]  And it does not help me as a console player.
[52:28.000 --> 52:29.980]  And I tried so many things.
[52:30.320 --> 52:31.280]  Nothing would work.
[52:31.660 --> 52:34.140]  I then realized that, oh, it's a network issue.
[52:34.140 --> 52:36.100]  So I had to figure out how to port forward.
[52:36.100 --> 52:37.360]  And that fixed it.
[52:37.500 --> 52:43.060]  But it was... I was trying to clean up some items in the Monkey Island stuff that I hadn't done.
[52:43.580 --> 52:47.100]  And it took just... my entire evening was spent troubleshooting Sea of Thieves.
[52:47.240 --> 52:49.420]  But I think we'll have so much fun playing that as a group.
[52:49.600 --> 52:51.180]  We need to organize that at some point.
[52:51.760 --> 52:54.400]  A comment leaver suggested that possibly the reason your
[52:55.040 --> 53:00.200]  rep is so low, by the way, is because of all your like destiny rubber banding and stuff.
[53:00.960 --> 53:01.840]  That's... I saw that.
[53:01.900 --> 53:04.280]  That isn't accurate because I did that with a friend.
[53:04.280 --> 53:06.260]  So we were gifting wins.
[53:06.460 --> 53:07.780]  So I don't know why people would be mad.
[53:07.880 --> 53:10.660]  It was a doubles playlist and my friend and I were both doing the same thing.
[53:11.120 --> 53:13.440]  Maybe they wanted to... maybe they wanted a challenge.
[53:13.720 --> 53:14.220]  I guess.
[53:14.300 --> 53:18.340]  But like, are you going to leave negative rep for like not... that seems like a weird move.
[53:19.180 --> 53:19.640]  That's fair.
[53:20.680 --> 53:22.920]  Did... did you guys end up recording a Warzone or no?
[53:23.160 --> 53:24.120]  Yes, we did.
[53:24.980 --> 53:25.680]  Was it fun?
[53:26.880 --> 53:27.400]  It was fun.
[53:27.620 --> 53:28.140]  I had a good time.
[53:28.140 --> 53:29.160]  Yeah, it was good.
[53:29.460 --> 53:30.080]  I enjoyed it.
[53:30.240 --> 53:33.500]  I mean, it's not... not a lot particularly happened in that one, but it was...
[53:33.500 --> 53:33.700]  No.
[53:33.700 --> 53:38.000]  It's not the best video we've ever made, but we had fun doing it.
[53:38.060 --> 53:40.820]  We couldn't find anyone in the map, strangely enough.
[53:41.080 --> 53:43.640]  Like, we played three games and encountered like six people.
[53:44.240 --> 53:45.020]  It was very weird.
[53:45.240 --> 53:46.300]  We had some funny stuff.
[53:46.420 --> 53:47.460]  We did... we jumped through some windows.
[53:47.860 --> 53:51.980]  We did some... some cool dives into the... out of like houseboats into the water and stuff.
[53:52.520 --> 53:53.240]  It was fun.
[53:53.360 --> 53:54.380]  I'm excited to do more.
[53:54.480 --> 53:56.760]  I like... I think they rotate the map in that game, right?
[53:56.860 --> 53:59.380]  Like, I actually prefer the original map more than that one.
[53:59.860 --> 54:02.560]  No, they don't really rotate as much as replace.
[54:03.260 --> 54:06.260]  Okay, well, there's a new season, I think, coming out really soon, right?
[54:06.680 --> 54:06.800]  Yeah.
[54:06.960 --> 54:07.360]  Yeah.
[54:07.440 --> 54:08.280]  I had to update the game.
[54:08.340 --> 54:14.460]  They just put Spawn in the game, I think, which is such a... such a weird property to still have like...
[54:14.460 --> 54:14.480]  Yeah.
[54:14.720 --> 54:18.900]  Like, I don't know what Spawn content is coming out or why anyone cares about Spawn.
[54:19.060 --> 54:20.780]  Who the fuck remembers Spawn?
[54:21.560 --> 54:22.180]  Like, I...
[54:22.180 --> 54:23.860]  That was the first superhero movie I ever saw.
[54:24.500 --> 54:24.900]  Really?
[54:25.280 --> 54:25.680]  Yeah.
[54:26.540 --> 54:27.960]  That's such an interesting...
[54:27.960 --> 54:32.200]  I think probably the original Spider-Man for me with Tobey Maguire would have been my first.
[54:32.200 --> 54:32.660]  Oh, yeah.
[54:32.840 --> 54:34.100]  What about you, Eric?
[54:34.600 --> 54:36.500]  What... what about me? The first superhero movie I ever saw?
[54:36.500 --> 54:37.280]  First superhero movie.
[54:37.600 --> 54:38.440]  Oh, man.
[54:38.880 --> 54:40.420]  What... what would it have been?
[54:40.560 --> 54:42.180]  One of the Batman movies, I guess?
[54:42.900 --> 54:43.460]  Because that was...
[54:43.460 --> 54:44.120]  Yeah, that's a good poll.
[54:44.260 --> 54:44.640]  89?
[54:45.460 --> 54:46.640]  Nick says Batman.
[54:49.800 --> 54:51.920]  That was... that was probably 89, right?
[54:52.020 --> 54:52.920]  What was before that?
[54:53.480 --> 54:56.140]  Batman came out on June 19th, 1989.
[54:56.740 --> 55:00.360]  So that was probably... I mean, I was probably three when that...
[55:00.360 --> 55:03.240]  I was three when that came out, so I probably saw it when I was four or five.
[55:03.580 --> 55:05.780]  I... I was in a shooting that night.
[55:06.040 --> 55:06.840]  What the fuck?
[55:06.840 --> 55:07.340]  What the fuck?
[55:07.700 --> 55:10.780]  Yeah, I saw... I saw Batman in high school the night it came out.
[55:10.820 --> 55:13.620]  It was my birthday, so it was very exciting to me because I was a fucking comic book nerd.
[55:13.940 --> 55:15.980]  And Batman, of all things, came out on my birthday.
[55:16.440 --> 55:18.100]  And so I went with my friends to go see Batman.
[55:18.320 --> 55:21.380]  And I believe Boys in the Hood came out at the same time.
[55:21.700 --> 55:26.520]  And while we were in Batman, there was a shooting in the Boys in the Hood movie theater.
[55:27.060 --> 55:27.420]  What?
[55:27.540 --> 55:29.000]  And we didn't have any idea.
[55:29.000 --> 55:32.060]  Came outside after the movie was over, and there were fucking ambulances and cops and stuff.
[55:32.180 --> 55:32.320]  Yeah.
[55:32.540 --> 55:35.380]  Had no idea it happened while we were in the theater.
[55:36.220 --> 55:40.200]  I was watching a... like, it just fed to me on TikTok recently.
[55:40.320 --> 55:41.420]  I thought this was so funny.
[55:41.780 --> 55:45.440]  This guy... he grew up... this part isn't the funny part.
[55:45.500 --> 55:46.340]  He grew up in a cult.
[55:46.920 --> 55:49.900]  His dad was, like, an extremist cult guy.
[55:50.100 --> 55:55.740]  And so he just wasn't exposed to, like, modern media as a kid growing up.
[55:55.740 --> 55:59.260]  And he eventually escaped it, from what I gathered from this clip.
[55:59.420 --> 56:03.580]  And he was riding a bike, and he saw an arcade through a window.
[56:04.460 --> 56:08.580]  And he wanted to, like, play the games or interact with the arcade.
[56:08.740 --> 56:11.020]  So he went up, and they said that he needed a ticket.
[56:11.260 --> 56:14.720]  And he got a ticket, but he didn't really understand what it was for.
[56:15.340 --> 56:18.560]  And then he went into the arcade, and then he decided to, like,
[56:18.640 --> 56:20.620]  pursue what the ticket thing was that he bought.
[56:20.780 --> 56:22.340]  And he had never been in a movie theater.
[56:22.440 --> 56:24.360]  He had no concept of what a movie was.
[56:24.360 --> 56:28.160]  And he sat in, and he was like, I was gonna shit myself.
[56:28.260 --> 56:31.160]  Like, everything was so loud. The screen was so big.
[56:31.380 --> 56:34.320]  I was overwhelmed. It changed my life.
[56:34.600 --> 56:37.660]  And the movie he watched was Head of State with Chris Rock.
[56:37.780 --> 56:39.540]  And that's so fucking funny to me.
[56:39.540 --> 56:43.620]  That his introduction to cinema was Head of State.
[56:43.820 --> 56:47.520]  And that it is, like, one of the most emotional moments of his life
[56:47.520 --> 56:52.440]  is watching this film that is such a throwaway for 99% of the population.
[56:52.440 --> 56:54.280]  Did that make it into our state's draft?
[56:55.380 --> 56:56.840]  I don't think so.
[56:56.940 --> 56:57.820]  It should have.
[56:58.820 --> 57:03.280]  What do you think is the worst first movie for a person to see?
[57:03.980 --> 57:05.120]  Of all movies?
[57:05.420 --> 57:05.700]  Yeah.
[57:06.600 --> 57:07.800]  I feel like...
[57:08.320 --> 57:09.320]  Human Centipede, right?
[57:10.100 --> 57:14.160]  That's a bad one. I was going to say Requiem for a Dream.
[57:14.460 --> 57:15.540]  Oh, that's a bad one.
[57:15.980 --> 57:16.520]  That movie fucked me up.
[57:16.640 --> 57:20.060]  Why does anyone watch any of these? Why do they make these?
[57:21.860 --> 57:22.940]  These suck.
[57:24.400 --> 57:24.960]  Um...
[57:24.960 --> 57:25.960]  Meet the Spartans.
[57:26.080 --> 57:27.340]  Yeah, I think that might be...
[57:28.080 --> 57:30.180]  Oh, that is a good...
[57:30.180 --> 57:33.620]  You would have no idea what anything is.
[57:34.280 --> 57:37.360]  That would be the most confusing fucking movie for you?
[57:37.520 --> 57:39.700]  Oh my god, that's a great answer.
[57:39.880 --> 57:42.700]  Just a bunch of clips of people saying shit that doesn't land.
[57:45.300 --> 57:46.780]  Oh, hey, uh...
[57:48.180 --> 57:50.720]  Andrew, I'm going to assume you're the only one that watched it,
[57:50.820 --> 57:52.300]  but did you watch Survivor last night?
[57:52.580 --> 57:55.720]  No, I haven't been able to. I try to watch those with my mom,
[57:55.980 --> 57:57.680]  and so I'm not going to be able to do that until Friday.
[57:58.280 --> 57:58.500]  So...
[57:58.500 --> 57:59.120]  Oh, okay.
[58:00.600 --> 58:01.400]  Well, uh...
[58:01.400 --> 58:02.160]  Nevermind then.
[58:03.100 --> 58:05.800]  Is it good? I'm really excited to watch it, I just haven't seen it yet.
[58:06.140 --> 58:08.520]  Uh, I will say this is the first...
[58:08.520 --> 58:11.680]  Usually you don't hate people until like episode three.
[58:11.880 --> 58:12.460]  Oh no.
[58:13.260 --> 58:16.760]  There's like three or four people on this season that I fucking can't stand.
[58:16.780 --> 58:17.380]  Already.
[58:18.260 --> 58:18.700]  And uh...
[58:18.700 --> 58:19.940]  Too many for one season.
[58:20.360 --> 58:21.800]  This is easily...
[58:21.800 --> 58:23.980]  No, it's good because you're immediately invested.
[58:24.380 --> 58:24.580]  Right?
[58:24.760 --> 58:27.220]  Like I want to see these people get voted out so badly.
[58:27.420 --> 58:28.140]  I'm more...
[58:28.140 --> 58:31.360]  Because usually the first two episodes of Survivor are feel-out episodes
[58:31.360 --> 58:34.400]  where you're just kind of getting the hang of the tribes and the dynamics,
[58:34.600 --> 58:36.680]  and it's nice to have a villain.
[58:36.880 --> 58:40.080]  And they're not even villains, just have a fucking unlikable person pretty quickly.
[58:40.680 --> 58:45.140]  Um, I have to say this is easily the wimpiest cast I've...
[58:45.140 --> 58:46.360]  in the history of Survivor.
[58:47.400 --> 58:48.860]  I'm so excited to watch it.
[58:48.900 --> 58:51.060]  They're just like, uh, it's hot.
[58:51.580 --> 58:52.380]  There's bugs.
[58:52.980 --> 58:53.780]  I'm uncomfortable.
[58:54.540 --> 58:56.120]  The ground is scratchy.
[58:56.500 --> 58:57.500]  I don't want to do this.
[58:57.560 --> 58:58.160]  That's heavy.
[58:58.380 --> 58:59.220]  That looks hard.
[58:59.340 --> 59:00.180]  I need to sit down.
[59:00.520 --> 59:01.380]  I gotta take a break.
[59:01.480 --> 59:02.500]  This isn't good for me.
[59:02.900 --> 59:04.080]  At night the monkeys come out.
[59:04.520 --> 59:05.900]  Yeah, at night the monkeys come out.
[59:06.000 --> 59:06.760]  It's fucking wild.
[59:08.880 --> 59:09.740]  I'm so excited.
[59:10.080 --> 59:13.740]  I've been meaning to tell you because you recommended that show The Traitors, right?
[59:13.980 --> 59:14.540]  I think you told us...
[59:14.540 --> 59:15.140]  Traitors, yeah.
[59:15.300 --> 59:15.980]  I fucking loved it.
[59:15.980 --> 59:17.720]  I've seen every season from every country.
[59:18.080 --> 59:19.280]  Yeah, I need to watch...
[59:19.280 --> 59:20.040]  I'm gonna watch it now.
[59:20.120 --> 59:24.440]  Did you see that, uh, they announced some of the cast for season two of The U.S. Traitors?
[59:24.720 --> 59:24.960]  No.
[59:25.360 --> 59:28.780]  Boston Rob is gonna be on it with Sandra and Poverty.
[59:29.240 --> 59:30.300]  That'll be awesome.
[59:30.840 --> 59:32.120]  Yeah, I think that'll be a really fun season.
[59:32.280 --> 59:36.660]  So I've been trying to start that because I remember how much you enjoyed it and recommended it.
[59:37.260 --> 59:43.420]  I think there was a, uh, there was a season of Australia Survivor that, um, that had Sandra on it.
[59:43.420 --> 59:47.920]  It was either, like, a Survivor Australia, like, an all-stars thing where Sandra went on it or
[59:47.920 --> 59:50.780]  some sort of a cross, like, some sort of a...
[59:50.780 --> 59:53.280]  You know how they challenged, like, the world season or whatever?
[59:53.580 --> 59:55.580]  Which I never saw past the U.S. version.
[59:55.680 --> 59:56.580]  I don't know how that turned out.
[59:56.900 --> 59:58.240]  But it might have been something like that.
[59:58.280 --> 01:00:01.460]  But I remember seeing that she was coming back to Survivor one more time.
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.340]  But it was, uh, in Australia.
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:03.860]  I know.
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:07.580]  I know Russell Hantz did that and was immediately voted out first once again.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:08.940]  Which is great.
[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:09.940]  Fuck that guy.
[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:14.180]  Maybe the most insulting comparable anyone's ever made with me.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.720]  You, Geoff, calling me Russell Hantz.
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.040]  I still think it...
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.100]  I still think it stands.
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:19.080]  No!
[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:21.180]  Does not stand.
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.620]  Hey, let me ask you guys a question.
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:25.500]  Okay.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:30.540]  You know how, like, at some point, sometimes throughout the course of your day,
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:36.980]  it's appropriate to hum or you, like, sing a little bit for some reason, you know?
[01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:39.840]  I'm gonna say yes, but I don't know if Gavin agrees based
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.260]  off of recent...
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:43.920]  You just don't ever catch yourself humming or, like...
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:49.100]  I just wonder, like, what is your go-to song when you, like, sing a song in your head
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:52.200]  or you think music and then you, like, catch yourself humming a song?
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:57.040]  I imagine this can't happen for Gavin because it would require some sort of an internal dialogue.
[01:00:57.060 --> 01:00:57.840]  No, I do have it.
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:01.180]  It just doesn't come out of my mouth, but it is playing in my head.
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:02.840]  Yeah, it doesn't have to come out of your mouth.
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:03.500]  It just plays in your...
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.680]  Playing in your head is just as good.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:08.040]  I'm actually, uh, tormented by something, but we'll get to that.
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:09.360]  That's what I want to know.
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:10.780]  I think you're about to tell us.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.520]  I want to know, like, what's the first song that comes to your mind when you think music
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.000]  or hum to myself while I'm washing the dishes or whatever?
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.020]  Do you have a go-to?
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:27.040]  Mine is a song called Swoon by the Chemical Brothers, and I worked on a music video for it.
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:33.300]  And over the course of five days, I probably heard that song 800 times.
[01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:37.200]  And since that day, when there's no song playing in my head,
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.540]  it's Swoon by the Chemical Brothers.
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:42.040]  And the song is basically like a siren.
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.880]  It just is an endless loop of...
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:46.780]  I don't know how to...
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:47.940]  It's... what was that?
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  Maybe 14 years ago at this point?
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.640]  I don't know how to get it out.
[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:53.840]  I just listen to some of it.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.060]  This would be, uh, this would make me, I think, go insane.
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:01.240]  Yeah, it's like seven minutes of...
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:04.100]  Oh my god.
[01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:10.500]  And I don't mind, you know, I didn't mind the Chemical Brothers before that.
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:14.520]  You've kind of caused this problem for me, Geoff, where you talked about recently,
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:18.820]  maybe us doing a supplemental content of like the songs we hate the most.
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:19.460]  Yeah.
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.840]  And I don't really feel super strongly about music,
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:25.740]  so it's having to really think about like, what are truly the songs I hate?
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:30.740]  And I remembered one, and it has now kind of been stuck in my head since it happened,
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:32.360]  and it has caused me so much pain.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.740]  I won't say what it is, but it has been on loop,
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:38.880]  and when we get to that content, I will share which one it was.
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:40.320]  I have a line from it.
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:44.420]  But that, on a positive side, Cupid's Chokehold in my head quite a bit.
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:46.640]  That just will randomly pop up constantly.
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:48.760]  Cupid's Chokehold, I don't know what that is.
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:51.900]  It's a Gym Class Heroes song from like 2007.
[01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:53.740]  Oh, the Super Tramp song?
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:55.580]  Yeah, the Super Tramp song.
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:57.180]  Take a look at my girlfriend.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.940]  Yeah, well, not that part, but yeah, that song.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.280]  That's... what a crazy... to have...
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.220]  Like, I don't even know, you call that like a cover?
[01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:06.540]  Like, what would you call that, Gavin?
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:08.060]  Like, a...
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:09.560]  It's just a Super Tramp song.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.840]  It's like barely changed.
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.400]  That's so weird.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.720]  What a strange pick.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.040]  Oh, it's a big song at the Redditch.
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.000]  Yeah, would you say it's a sample, or would you...
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:20.460]  Like, what is that?
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:21.260]  Like a re... I don't know.
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:22.400]  I guess?
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:23.920]  I mean, it's most...
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:27.480]  It's just the hook from the song, and then other stuff, and it's like, yeah, right?
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.860]  Like a reimagining, a reinterpretation of it.
[01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:30.580]  Yeah.
[01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:34.300]  For me, it's most...
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:37.660]  It's mostly Still Tippin' by Mike Jones.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:39.700]  That's a good one, too.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.300]  But that changes a lot.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:45.680]  Like, it's, you know, sort of whatever is in my...
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:50.100]  Like, I'm sure, Geoff, with you, do you have one song that you go to,
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.140]  or is it like a bunch of di...
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:52.560]  Like, I heard this recently.
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:56.840]  No, it is for me, and I'm trying to figure out how long it's been my song,
[01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:57.440]  because I didn't...
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.400]  Mike Jones.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.620]  I listened to...
[01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:01.380]  I listened to...
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.980]  I watched Dallas every day of my life, right?
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.560]  And I was thinking about how iconic the Dallas theme song is.
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:10.800]  And so I was thinking to myself,
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:11.980]  I should try to make that...
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:14.660]  I should just try to start humming that song all the time,
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:15.820]  because I'm always thinking...
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:20.020]  But, and every time I start to do it, it morphs into the A-Team theme song.
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:23.160]  And I realized that whenever I hum or think of music in my head,
[01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:25.440]  it's always the A-Team theme song.
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:26.740]  100% of the time.
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:27.700]  My entire life.
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:31.500]  And I'm wondering, has it been that way since I was a child?
[01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:33.220]  Or is that recent?
[01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:34.140]  I think it's been forever.
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:36.480]  And I think I was even talking about it with you recently, Eric.
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:37.060]  Maybe.
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:39.300]  Did we talk about the A-Team song together recently?
[01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:41.740]  It might have been a different Eric.
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.380]  But yeah, I don't know. I don't know why.
[01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:44.280]  But it's the fucking...
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.110]  Anytime I think of music in my head, I go...
[01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:50.510]  It's a great one.
[01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:53.290]  And that's like, I guess that's like...
[01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:57.450]  If you looked up music in the dictionary, in my dictionary,
[01:04:57.650 --> 01:04:59.210]  it would be the A-Team theme song.
[01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:01.470]  Did you ever... What was that?
[01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:04.610]  It was like A-Team theme song mixed with Beastie Boys.
[01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:05.210]  Did you ever hear that?
[01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:07.350]  No. That sounds cool.
[01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:09.550]  Was it like officially by them or like a remix?
[01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:11.550]  Oh, I assume it was someone else made it.
[01:05:11.610 --> 01:05:13.090]  I think someone sent it to me on MSN.
[01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:15.410]  Is it intergalactic?
[01:05:16.090 --> 01:05:16.930]  Oh, probably.
[01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:21.350]  Good guess, Eric.
[01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:21.670]  Yeah, I think it was.
[01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.610]  Good guess.
[01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:25.230]  I mean, I'm just thinking like, what's the most annoying Beastie Boys song?
[01:05:29.790 --> 01:05:32.510]  That's a song... Oh, that might be on my list.
[01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:34.170]  Not a big intergalactic fan.
[01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:35.350]  You don't like intergalactic?
[01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:37.390]  I love the Beastie Boys.
[01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:42.690]  That song, I have just heard so many times that if I never, ever, ever, ever, ever,
[01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:44.610]  ever heard it again, that would be just fine.
[01:05:45.050 --> 01:05:45.490]  That's fair.
[01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:48.070]  There's definite songs that get overplayed.
[01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:49.150]  That's definitely one of them.
[01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:51.510]  Yeah, I could see that.
[01:05:51.610 --> 01:05:53.110]  I could support that, actually.
[01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:55.270]  It is definitely not their greatest song.
[01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:58.610]  And it definitely did get rammed down our throats for quite a while.
[01:05:58.850 --> 01:05:59.670]  Yeah, I looked it up.
[01:05:59.730 --> 01:06:00.450]  It is intergalactic.
[01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:01.870]  That's great.
[01:06:02.030 --> 01:06:06.070]  Just, I'm thinking about like, the A-Team is such an annoying song.
[01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:08.290]  What's an annoying song that would go with it?
[01:06:08.330 --> 01:06:09.530]  And it would have to be intergalactic.
[01:06:09.550 --> 01:06:12.690]  I will say, I think combined, they're both less annoying.
[01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:14.270]  That's interesting.
[01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:20.070]  I think they've made it work by combining it with the A-Team.
[01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:21.230]  Oh my god.
[01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:23.050]  We should wrap up.
[01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:24.070]  We gotta do this Tony Hawk thing.
[01:06:24.210 --> 01:06:24.650]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:25.290]  Let's, we should.
[01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:27.650]  And I got something to do after this, so I gotta get going.
[01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:29.830]  Nick, how does Madness by Muse go?
[01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:31.570]  Yeah, we're wrapping up.
[01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:45.330]  You know how everybody gets obsessed with talking about who the goat of a
[01:06:45.330 --> 01:06:46.310]  particular sport is?
[01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:47.970]  Like, greatest of all time.
[01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:50.210]  You're wondering, like, what's the best goat?
[01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:52.410]  No, no, although that's interesting.
[01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:55.090]  I assume it would be fainting goats, because they're pretty cute.
[01:06:55.450 --> 01:06:56.450]  It'd be Billy or fainting.
[01:06:56.830 --> 01:06:59.850]  It's between, it's between NBA seasons right now, and so there's always,
[01:07:00.590 --> 01:07:03.270]  sports commentators are always struggling for content, so they always go like,
[01:07:03.310 --> 01:07:07.730]  is it MJ or, you know, Bill Russell or LeBron or whatever?
[01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:11.530]  And I was thinking the other day, what is the woat?
[01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:16.830]  We never talk about, who is the worst professional athlete of all time per sport?
[01:07:17.610 --> 01:07:19.650]  Something to think about as we end this episode.
[01:07:19.830 --> 01:07:22.210]  Maybe we can, yeah, I'll come back with an answer for next time.
[01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:26.390]  Like, I assume, I assume Andrew has a hockey answer, or he will.
[01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:28.510]  I have an MMA answer, actually, immediately.
[01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:29.430]  There you go.
[01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:31.690]  And I've never really thought about it for basketball players,
[01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:33.410]  but I bet you could look it up statistically,
[01:07:33.610 --> 01:07:36.150]  there has to be a worst NBA player of all time.
[01:07:36.290 --> 01:07:38.930]  There has to be a worst English Premier League player of all time.
[01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:42.150]  Yeah, there's gotta be a Premier League player who only ever scored own goals.
[01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:46.730]  There definitely has to be.
[01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:51.890]  Like, the sum total of his or her professional career was a negative to the team.
[01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:53.650]  Yeah, a huge negative.
[01:07:54.550 --> 01:08:00.150]  Anyway, something to think about while you pine away and wait for next week's recording,
[01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:03.730]  when we all get to get back together again and talk about all the things that
[01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:05.750]  make life interesting and make us laugh.
[01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:08.470]  And then we all talk about how funny we all think each other are,
[01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:10.590]  except for Gavin, who's not particularly impressed with any of us.
[01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:13.090]  Thanks for listening to another episode of F*** Face.
[01:08:13.210 --> 01:08:14.030]  We'll see you next time.
[01:08:14.170 --> 01:08:14.850]  Like and subscribe.
[01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:19.730]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:08:20.050 --> 01:08:20.710]  Nice voice.
[01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:22.010]  Let's talk poop.
[01:08:22.290 --> 01:08:23.350]  The boys time travel.
[01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:25.090]  What's the best dog in a movie?
[01:08:25.530 --> 01:08:26.550]  Geoff's ghost returns.
[01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:29.090]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:32.110]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
