[00:09.850 --> 00:12.330]  Are you guys okay if I tell a gross story?
[00:12.650 --> 00:13.330]  Oh, yes.
[00:13.410 --> 00:14.430]  I'm okay with it.
[00:15.130 --> 00:17.450]  Goddamn, Nick is fuckin'...
[00:17.450 --> 00:19.850]  Nick is fist-pumpin' right now.
[00:20.370 --> 00:21.850]  He's been waitin'.
[00:25.530 --> 00:26.370]  Okay, okay.
[00:27.230 --> 00:29.590]  Alright. It's not that gross, but it's gross.
[00:30.150 --> 00:34.170]  He's doing, like, the Nick Cage head-spin and face-off when he's dressed as the priest.
[00:34.250 --> 00:35.990]  He's just fuckin' going wild over this.
[00:36.150 --> 00:37.370]  Goddamn, that was funny.
[00:38.550 --> 00:42.690]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:42.990 --> 00:45.430]  This is episode 176.
[00:46.030 --> 00:50.510]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, and with me, as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[00:50.970 --> 00:51.390]  Hello.
[00:51.730 --> 00:52.130]  Hiya.
[00:52.510 --> 00:52.990]  Hi.
[00:53.710 --> 00:54.730]  That's my name.
[00:55.130 --> 00:55.750]  I felt...
[00:55.750 --> 00:56.730]  Your name is Andrew.
[00:56.870 --> 00:57.790]  I felt like...
[00:57.790 --> 00:58.010]  Yeah.
[00:58.050 --> 00:58.990]  I feel like that was a pretty good intro.
[00:59.130 --> 00:59.490]  That's me.
[00:59.590 --> 01:00.930]  It was like, nobody stepped on me.
[01:01.330 --> 01:02.170]  I didn't stutter.
[01:02.670 --> 01:03.990]  I feel like we nailed that one.
[01:03.990 --> 01:05.190]  That's like a...
[01:05.190 --> 01:06.750]  Like, if you want to show a...
[01:07.190 --> 01:11.510]  Like, a dictionary definition of a good intro, I feel like you could show that.
[01:11.710 --> 01:14.590]  I don't think it would be near the definition of energy, though.
[01:14.950 --> 01:15.210]  No.
[01:15.290 --> 01:16.050]  You don't think I had energy?
[01:16.510 --> 01:18.490]  No, I think you had energy, but it wasn't like...
[01:18.490 --> 01:20.530]  It wouldn't be a defining intro for energy.
[01:20.810 --> 01:24.030]  I think it was a perfectly acceptable intro to this show.
[01:24.290 --> 01:26.230]  Not memorable, either way.
[01:26.570 --> 01:26.810]  But, like, funny.
[01:26.810 --> 01:27.730]  I felt like it was...
[01:28.670 --> 01:29.430]  Not memorable.
[01:30.350 --> 01:30.750]  No.
[01:30.750 --> 01:30.870]  No.
[01:31.230 --> 01:34.570]  And I say that, like, with nothing but respect and love for you, Geoff.
[01:34.570 --> 01:35.870]  Why don't you show me...
[01:35.870 --> 01:36.790]  Alright, little dickhead.
[01:36.870 --> 01:37.950]  Why don't you show me...
[01:37.950 --> 01:39.270]  Why don't you show me energy?
[01:40.210 --> 01:41.110]  Oh, you want energy?
[01:41.350 --> 01:43.250]  Well, this is wacky energy!
[01:43.570 --> 01:44.930]  This is a talk show!
[01:45.350 --> 01:46.390]  Morning radio!
[01:47.250 --> 01:50.550]  We're listening to F*** Face on the station 106.5 on the wave!
[01:51.170 --> 01:53.950]  Why did you change the whole intro with energy, though?
[01:54.550 --> 01:55.470]  I don't know.
[01:55.770 --> 01:56.310]  I just...
[01:56.310 --> 01:57.270]  I went into...
[01:57.270 --> 02:00.190]  When I think energy and, like, talking, I think, like, radio.
[02:00.190 --> 02:01.590]  Because it feels very forced.
[02:01.710 --> 02:03.910]  I will say that, Geoff, you didn't have a forced energy.
[02:04.430 --> 02:08.590]  So, you want me to do forced radio DJ energy?
[02:08.850 --> 02:10.030]  Yes, I do, actually.
[02:10.190 --> 02:12.030]  I'd love to hear you do forced radio energy.
[02:12.850 --> 02:13.850]  Oh, God.
[02:14.470 --> 02:16.770]  See, it's not in you today, because you're just not...
[02:16.770 --> 02:19.690]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of...
[02:19.690 --> 02:20.650]  F*** Face!
[02:21.870 --> 02:24.630]  That's right, it's me, the gator, Geoff Ramsey!
[02:24.810 --> 02:29.430]  And with me, as always, the goose pooch, Gabby Wabby!
[02:29.430 --> 02:30.610]  And Johnny Caviar!
[02:31.610 --> 02:32.590]  What's going on, fellas?
[02:33.450 --> 02:36.130]  Now, that was very high energy, but I think your other one was better.
[02:36.290 --> 02:37.350]  But that was great energy.
[02:37.850 --> 02:38.390]  10 out of 10.
[02:38.650 --> 02:39.670]  We gotta move on.
[02:39.990 --> 02:40.930]  I don't know why I said gator.
[02:41.070 --> 02:42.150]  Eric's asking why I said gator.
[02:42.250 --> 02:42.690]  I don't know.
[02:42.770 --> 02:43.650]  It just seemed like a morning...
[02:43.650 --> 02:45.110]  It came out of you, and I like that.
[02:45.210 --> 02:46.470]  I like that we learned that about you today.
[02:46.490 --> 02:48.130]  I think we've got a new spontaneous nickname.
[02:48.790 --> 02:49.590]  Yeah, Gator.
[02:50.350 --> 02:51.430]  Geoff the Gator Ramsey.
[02:51.730 --> 02:52.710]  I'm not mad at gator.
[02:52.930 --> 02:54.770]  I don't like it as much as T-Bone, but I'll take gator.
[02:55.610 --> 02:57.650]  Gator feels like they would be friends with T-Bone.
[02:57.650 --> 03:00.030]  I'm like, if T-Bone had a friend named Gator, that just checks out.
[03:00.150 --> 03:00.710]  That feels right.
[03:00.830 --> 03:02.810]  Dude, T-Bone and Gator sounds like...
[03:03.630 --> 03:06.630]  That sounds like an adventure two dudes have hopping trains.
[03:06.910 --> 03:07.190]  You know?
[03:07.410 --> 03:07.810]  Yes.
[03:08.150 --> 03:09.470]  The adventure of T-Bone and Gator.
[03:10.330 --> 03:14.470]  Traveling across the country, mixing it up, getting into trouble, getting out of trouble.
[03:15.010 --> 03:15.410]  Yeah.
[03:16.450 --> 03:18.870]  I'd listen or watch T-Bone and Gator for sure.
[03:19.630 --> 03:20.350]  Either way.
[03:20.650 --> 03:22.550]  I've made a worst of all time discovery.
[03:23.030 --> 03:23.510]  What's that?
[03:23.530 --> 03:23.910]  Oh, you did?
[03:24.570 --> 03:26.950]  Yeah, I don't know what the theme is for worst of all time.
[03:26.950 --> 03:27.910]  It could just be anything, right?
[03:28.430 --> 03:28.490]  Yeah.
[03:28.510 --> 03:29.710]  Well, it was sports, wasn't it?
[03:29.830 --> 03:31.390]  I thought it was sports specific.
[03:31.530 --> 03:31.810]  Oh, okay.
[03:31.910 --> 03:32.650]  This isn't sports.
[03:33.170 --> 03:33.850]  Well, that's fine.
[03:34.010 --> 03:35.330]  I still want to hear your worst of all time.
[03:35.630 --> 03:40.210]  Okay, the worst social media video editor of all time.
[03:40.990 --> 03:41.310]  Oh.
[03:41.850 --> 03:42.570]  Britney Spears.
[03:42.790 --> 03:44.710]  She is absolutely dog shit.
[03:45.170 --> 03:46.810]  There's cuts in the middle of words.
[03:47.350 --> 03:49.270]  There's like repetition of the same...
[03:49.270 --> 03:50.490]  None of it makes any sense.
[03:50.850 --> 03:51.890]  Do you think that's on her?
[03:52.830 --> 03:54.210]  Well, like, is it her doing it?
[03:54.750 --> 03:55.030]  Yeah.
[03:55.410 --> 03:56.130]  Oh, I don't know.
[03:56.130 --> 03:58.130]  I would assume not.
[03:58.470 --> 03:58.970]  Really?
[03:59.530 --> 04:00.750]  I don't think so.
[04:01.390 --> 04:02.910]  Ah, I don't know.
[04:03.510 --> 04:04.650]  But I have no idea. It could be.
[04:04.910 --> 04:05.470]  It's true.
[04:05.850 --> 04:08.150]  I'm not in the Britney Spears loop right now.
[04:09.610 --> 04:11.050]  Yeah, I don't know.
[04:12.110 --> 04:16.870]  You know, nothing against her, but there's absolutely no cohesion through it.
[04:17.270 --> 04:24.150]  You know, I saw the other day that she had a video recently, a non-cohesive video recently, where she was clanging knives together.
[04:24.510 --> 04:24.730]  Oh.
[04:25.150 --> 04:25.550]  Yes.
[04:25.990 --> 04:30.030]  I read that the police department did a health and welfare check on her because of that.
[04:30.530 --> 04:32.790]  I assume they weren't real knives. Were they actual knives?
[04:33.230 --> 04:35.290]  I don't know, but I'm glad that people are looking out for her.
[04:35.650 --> 04:36.050]  Yeah.
[04:36.570 --> 04:41.450]  That's not a joke. I love Britney Spears. I want her to be happy and healthy.
[04:42.070 --> 04:43.450]  And enjoying freedom.
[04:43.950 --> 04:48.490]  Yeah, right? Like, she had a fucking raw deal with that conservatorship, and she's finally free of it.
[04:48.730 --> 04:51.110]  And newly divorced now, too, apparently, which is sad.
[04:51.110 --> 04:53.050]  Oh yeah, we were just talking about her recently.
[04:53.530 --> 04:55.490]  And her young husband.
[04:55.850 --> 04:57.530]  Young ex-husband. Soon-to-be ex-husband.
[04:58.090 --> 04:59.190]  Yeah, were we the cause of that?
[05:00.150 --> 05:02.550]  I think we were the cause of something else recently, weren't we?
[05:03.210 --> 05:03.570]  No.
[05:04.370 --> 05:04.670]  Okay.
[05:04.890 --> 05:05.470]  Absolutely not.
[05:07.130 --> 05:08.030]  Let's just stop it there.
[05:08.350 --> 05:08.790]  We weren't.
[05:10.490 --> 05:11.590]  We 100% were not.
[05:11.850 --> 05:12.370]  Oh, good.
[05:12.890 --> 05:15.810]  You wanna hear my worst of all time? I got a worst of all time. It's sports-related.
[05:16.090 --> 05:16.430]  Okay.
[05:16.430 --> 05:25.270]  I don't know if anyone else has done research for this. I kinda struggled with, like, you don't want somebody that just bounced out of any league immediately.
[05:25.650 --> 05:30.490]  Like, I don't know, I just feel like that's... you want, like, longevity in their badness.
[05:30.550 --> 05:35.230]  Or, like, they were so uniquely bad that things, like, ended.
[05:35.570 --> 05:37.470]  Or that's, like, the blemish on their thing.
[05:37.890 --> 05:45.510]  My worst of all time, and it's to this day, the worst sporting moment I've ever seen for just being completely unenjoyable.
[05:45.510 --> 05:47.130]  Nothing great about it.
[05:47.250 --> 05:52.230]  Is an MMA fight between Miguel Falco and Gerald Harris.
[05:52.790 --> 05:55.770]  Which happened, like, over 10 years ago at this point, I'd say.
[05:55.990 --> 05:57.150]  And I still think about it.
[05:57.510 --> 06:00.650]  The most non-exciting... just nothing happened.
[06:00.910 --> 06:03.070]  Just two guys looking at each other.
[06:03.370 --> 06:05.870]  And it was Miguel Falco's first fight in the UFC.
[06:06.230 --> 06:12.030]  And he had all this rep going into it as, like, this devastating knockout puncher that is gonna destroy everyone.
[06:12.150 --> 06:14.990]  Like, none of his fights exited, like, made it out of the first round.
[06:14.990 --> 06:18.790]  And it was just nothingness for the entire time.
[06:19.150 --> 06:23.830]  Type of match where if it was the first ever MMA fight, the whole sport wouldn't have taken off.
[06:23.950 --> 06:24.690]  It would have collapsed.
[06:25.010 --> 06:31.770]  And that is only emphasized by the fact that that is Miguel Falco's only fight in the UFC.
[06:32.010 --> 06:36.190]  I think he got arrested for something and there was visa issues.
[06:36.310 --> 06:41.150]  So then he was quickly, like, once other problems showed up, cut from the roster.
[06:41.150 --> 06:45.970]  But what made it, like, exceptionally bad is he was fighting a guy named Gerald Harris.
[06:46.430 --> 06:53.070]  And at that time, the kind of general rule in the UFC was if you lose three fights in a row, you're done.
[06:53.190 --> 06:55.950]  But that is sort of the exception. Like, three fights, you're out.
[06:56.330 --> 07:02.850]  He was on a three-fight winning streak, lost that fight, and was cut from the roster because it was so boring.
[07:03.150 --> 07:03.770]  Won and out.
[07:04.570 --> 07:07.010]  Won and out. One loss and out.
[07:07.010 --> 07:13.650]  So that is my worst of all time when I think of sports is immediately to Miguel Falco, Gerald Harris.
[07:13.870 --> 07:17.710]  It's a shame, too, because Miguel Falco was a really good fighting name.
[07:18.110 --> 07:19.690]  Like, you could have the Falco Punch.
[07:20.330 --> 07:23.370]  You could be protected by Falcos.
[07:23.470 --> 07:25.090]  You could be protected by Falcos, exactly.
[07:26.090 --> 07:30.970]  You could be some version of E.D. Falco, I guess.
[07:32.510 --> 07:34.530]  You could be Nurse Betty.
[07:35.710 --> 07:37.250]  Well, no, what about Falcon Punch?
[07:37.390 --> 07:38.690]  Like, I think of Star Fox.
[07:38.830 --> 07:40.330]  Like, it's not exactly the same.
[07:40.490 --> 07:41.710]  Yeah, Falco Punch, yeah.
[07:41.930 --> 07:42.830]  Isn't that what you just said?
[07:43.170 --> 07:44.630]  Yeah, it was the first thing.
[07:45.350 --> 07:47.790]  Geoff, do you have a vote for anything?
[07:48.330 --> 07:51.370]  No, I haven't looked into it yet, unfortunately.
[07:51.690 --> 07:55.230]  I apologize, but I will deliver some votes for you guys soon.
[07:55.630 --> 07:59.490]  I have one, but I don't think you guys are going to agree that it's a vote.
[07:59.950 --> 08:00.350]  Okay.
[08:00.630 --> 08:04.190]  But it is the thing in which all votes are judged, to me.
[08:04.190 --> 08:08.630]  Which is Mario Mendoza, former baseball player.
[08:09.030 --> 08:19.970]  As he was so bad having a league average, a batting average of 200, that they named the 200 batting average the Mendoza line.
[08:20.390 --> 08:25.490]  Where if you are batting below 200, you are likely to get cut or sent down.
[08:25.890 --> 08:32.870]  And that is the line at which he batted, I think, almost every year of his professional career.
[08:33.590 --> 08:53.730]  So, to be so bad that they name the bar that they judge people being bad after you, to me, is really exceptional and really stand out in terms of what the vote is.
[08:53.950 --> 08:58.030]  I would argue that if he's not below his own bar, there's other votes.
[08:58.030 --> 09:05.150]  Exactly, there are. But, they are, like Geoff's intro today, not memorable.
[09:05.870 --> 09:11.090]  And Mario Mendoza is due to the Mendoza line.
[09:12.210 --> 09:19.430]  God damn it, why do I keep catching stray bullets about my fucking intro? It was a perfectly regulation intro, thank you Gavin.
[09:19.870 --> 09:20.790]  Yeah, no, it was fine.
[09:20.870 --> 09:26.170]  Sorry, Gator. I just thought that, you know, it's just not memorable. And I think Mario Mendoza is.
[09:26.170 --> 09:31.590]  I think it got a nickname. I think a nickname came out of it, so that is pretty memorable right there.
[09:31.770 --> 09:32.210]  That's true.
[09:32.690 --> 09:33.410]  Fucking hell.
[09:33.690 --> 09:35.810]  Well, the nickname came out in the redo, to be fair.
[09:36.110 --> 09:37.190]  Yeah, it didn't come from your unmemorable intro.
[09:37.210 --> 09:44.630]  Yeah, but if I hadn't done a perfectly regulation, fairly memorable intro that then you guys shit on, I wouldn't have done the second intro.
[09:44.810 --> 09:54.610]  Yeah, but that's all butterfly effect stuff. You can't really argue. You know, that's like going back like three trades or like three years in the NBA and going like, well, if this guy didn't get traded here, this wouldn't have happened. You can't do that, Geoff.
[09:54.610 --> 09:56.370]  What do you think is the worst shit?
[09:57.230 --> 09:57.450]  What?
[09:57.570 --> 09:58.230]  What do you mean?
[09:58.470 --> 10:03.590]  It's like common shits, like dog shit, like something's dog shit or like horse shit, if it's not true.
[10:04.490 --> 10:05.670]  Like what's the worst shit?
[10:05.770 --> 10:07.530]  I don't even know how to measure this.
[10:08.090 --> 10:11.270]  Well, how many shits are there? There's dog shit, horse shit.
[10:11.450 --> 10:11.990]  There's bullshit.
[10:12.830 --> 10:13.270]  Bullshit.
[10:13.850 --> 10:14.770]  Bullshit's pretty bad.
[10:15.690 --> 10:16.450]  Fish shit.
[10:16.750 --> 10:17.810]  Are we being literal?
[10:18.570 --> 10:21.470]  What about wombats? Wombats poop square.
[10:21.730 --> 10:22.990]  Oh, there's bat shit.
[10:23.270 --> 10:23.870]  Oh, like guano?
[10:23.870 --> 10:31.050]  But like, it's a weird... it's like how it's used as opposed to what the actual shit is, is the problem.
[10:31.470 --> 10:34.810]  I think dog shit is the worst because...
[10:34.810 --> 10:35.430]  Yeah.
[10:36.110 --> 10:38.510]  It doesn't necessarily mean anything other than terrible.
[10:39.510 --> 10:46.990]  Yeah, exactly. But I think a bull's literal shit is way worse than a dog's literal shit. It's just like, how are we measuring this?
[10:47.490 --> 10:49.950]  What animal has the smelliest shit?
[10:50.430 --> 10:51.330]  I have no idea.
[10:51.330 --> 10:54.430]  What animal has the smelliest shit?
[10:54.650 --> 10:55.030]  Let's see.
[10:55.230 --> 10:55.830]  I bet it's cowpat.
[10:55.950 --> 10:58.150]  What's the name of the... maybe it's a herring.
[10:59.170 --> 10:59.430]  Oh.
[11:00.590 --> 11:06.350]  Horse shit, cat shit, dog shit, human shit, cow shit, pig shit, elephant shit...
[11:06.350 --> 11:07.250]  All the greatest hits.
[11:07.490 --> 11:09.870]  Is this a list or are you just naming...
[11:09.870 --> 11:14.490]  Yeah, that's a list. It goes from one to eight or whatever. So apparently horse shit's the worst smelliest shit.
[11:14.490 --> 11:16.270]  A preview of our upcoming shit draft.
[11:16.270 --> 11:21.330]  But we're number four, so we're hanging in there as humans.
[11:21.410 --> 11:22.350]  Man, do I have a shit story for you guys?
[11:22.350 --> 11:23.010]  Oh, let's go.
[11:24.570 --> 11:25.730]  Oh, let's do it.
[11:26.010 --> 11:27.130]  Oh, yeah, I can do that.
[11:29.150 --> 11:35.250]  So, it's been a very busy few weeks. I don't know if you guys know this, but I'm getting married and we're getting kind of close to it, so a lot of stuff is happening.
[11:36.230 --> 11:44.090]  And in addition to the fact that for some fucking reason I decided to make another podcast and also start doing gaming content again, so I've been a little busy.
[11:44.090 --> 11:53.650]  Little Geoffy's been busy lately, and it's been a particularly stressful time, which is cool. I don't mind stress, but I thought last weekend that I would...
[11:53.650 --> 11:57.850]  Emily has been similarly stressed, so I thought, I'm gonna do something nice for her and by proxy for me.
[11:58.210 --> 12:05.290]  So I booked us a couple's massage, something that... we always get like a couple's massage on a vacation, like when we go to Mexico or somewhere, right?
[12:05.730 --> 12:10.170]  And so I thought, there's no reason why we can't do one in town, like on a fucking Saturday.
[12:10.170 --> 12:12.910]  Same weird sort of thing, or are you just both getting one at the same time?
[12:12.910 --> 12:21.470]  Yeah, no, same room. And so I went to this place we'd never been to before. It was fine. It's one of those, you know, spa chains.
[12:23.570 --> 12:34.030]  Fairly regulation place. And you know, the way it... most of them were... I don't know if you guys have had couple's massages before, but the way it traditionally works when I do this is there's like a...
[12:34.030 --> 12:43.390]  They tell you to get there like 20 minutes early because they want you to like get undressed and get into your robe and chill out in their little waiting room and listen to Whale's Mate or whatever and drink cucumber water.
[12:43.910 --> 12:51.950]  And so we get there 20 minutes early or whatever and we... they take us into a room and it's like a little, I don't know, meditation, calming room.
[12:52.090 --> 12:59.110]  It's got some, you know, it's got like fucking bamboos and shit in there. And there's like a door to the left for the men's room and a door to the right for the ladies room.
[12:59.110 --> 13:12.870]  And they go, just make yourselves comfortable and whenever you're ready go in and change your clothes and then come back out, sit here for 15 or 20 minutes, you know, smell the aromatics or whatever the fuck is going on in here and relax and we'll come get you and massage you.
[13:12.870 --> 13:29.470]  And so I go into the men's room and Emily goes into the women's room and you walk in and there's like a... there's just like a stall that's shut and then a shower to the right and then on the left some, what do you call that thing, a sink, right?
[13:29.670 --> 13:41.250]  And then on the right there's a couple of... there's lockers to put your shit in. And so I start to get undressed and put my stuff in the locker and I'm not thinking anything, I'm alone in this room, right?
[13:41.250 --> 13:49.250]  It's a really small room, it's not that big, there's only one stall for the bathroom. And as I'm taking my shirt off I hear a guy go...
[13:53.790 --> 14:02.210]  And I go, oh no, I am not alone in this room. And this guy's going through it. And I don't smell anything and I'm like, okay, alright.
[14:02.210 --> 14:10.210]  And I just thought like, I should get undressed quickly and put this robe on. And so I'm just like getting undressed and throwing stuff in and I'm just hearing like...
[14:11.790 --> 14:25.530]  Like this guy's going through it. He's having a major event in the toilet, right? And so I'm like pretty uncomfortable because it's a pretty small bathroom and I feel like I'm three feet away from a guy who's dumping out his kidneys.
[14:26.690 --> 14:36.790]  And so I go, I'm like, oh fuck. So I'm just like shoving stuff in the locker and I don't understand how the lock works. And so I just like slam it shut and I'm like, fuck this, I'm getting out of here.
[14:36.810 --> 14:38.680]  And as I'm getting out of here, I hear the guy go...
[14:43.330 --> 14:52.850]  Like at the top of his voice. And I go, oh no, I get the fuck out of there. I don't know what that is, I don't want to know, I don't want to be in the room, I don't want to smell it when it happens.
[14:52.850 --> 15:01.110]  I just get out of there and I go sit down in the waiting area and Emily comes out a few seconds later and I tell her, kind of whisper the story to her and we both just start laughing.
[15:01.350 --> 15:13.490]  We're laughing and laughing and laughing. And not too long later, this woman, this older woman comes out of the women's bathroom and she's all dressed, she's got a dress on and like her hair is done nice and she's got earrings and jewelry on and stuff.
[15:13.490 --> 15:24.430]  Clearly it's taken her a while to get dressed and I immediately clock and go like, oh, I bet she's the wife or the significant other of the dude who's shitting his brains out in the other bathroom.
[15:25.310 --> 15:33.830]  And so we start to get a little quiet, you know, and I just keep thinking like, I hope they come to get us before this guy walks out the door because I don't want to see what made those noises, right?
[15:33.850 --> 15:39.270]  I don't want anything to do with it. And we're just trying not to laugh and like we just keep looking at each other.
[15:39.270 --> 15:48.070]  It's one of those things that every time we look at each other, we just start fucking busting out laughing and we're trying not to be too disruptive to the lady who's, you know, enjoying her post massage or whatever.
[15:49.130 --> 15:56.010]  And then I asked Emily, I was trying to say something and I go, did you lock your locker? And she's like, yeah, I locked my locker. Why?
[15:56.130 --> 16:01.870]  And I was like, oh, I don't know how to do it. I couldn't figure it out. And I was trying to get out of there in a hurry. And she was like, they didn't tell you how to lock it.
[16:01.870 --> 16:07.230]  They just they showed me and they didn't show me. It was a lady. So she didn't go into the bathroom with me. She just opened the door and I walked in.
[16:07.550 --> 16:12.610]  And so Emily told me how to lock it. And I thought, well, my phone is in there. And well, yeah, my phone is in there a bunch of other stuff.
[16:12.670 --> 16:17.910]  Oh, no. And so I should I'll just run in there and lock it real fast because this guy has not come out.
[16:18.250 --> 16:24.290]  But I also think like, you know, the paranoid part of me is like, guy's been in there like a half an hour. Is he just going through my wallet right now?
[16:24.290 --> 16:31.190]  You know, so I run in there and and I I don't see the guy. I open the door and there's nobody in there. And I think that's weird.
[16:31.310 --> 16:36.890]  And then I hear the shower going. I realize that I'm here in water and he's taking a fucking shower. And so I lock my wall.
[16:36.950 --> 16:42.770]  Look, I get out of there and I go tell him, like, it was so bad. He shit himself. He had to take a shower. Like, that's why he was screaming shit.
[16:42.830 --> 16:49.590]  Oh, shit. He must have. He must have shit all over himself. And his only recourse is to take a fucking shower now.
[16:49.590 --> 16:54.010]  Like, and this poor woman has been out there for 15 minutes waiting on him. And this dude is now in the shower.
[16:54.470 --> 16:58.870]  And you figure, you know, it guys typically get dressed pretty fucking fast, right? In the grand scheme of things.
[16:59.070 --> 17:11.110]  So he's probably been in there a while and she's just waiting. And I feel terrible because this guy's clearly going through it and clearly having to wash the shit off of his body from his explosive diarrhea or whatever it was.
[17:11.530 --> 17:22.390]  And so I go back out and I whisper to Emily and we start laughing again. And then they come and get us. And then we have a massage in the same room. Normal bog standard massage. It was fine. I give it a B minus massage. It was okay.
[17:22.850 --> 17:31.570]  But the whole time I'm just trying not to laugh because all I can hear in my head is that guy go, oh, shit. Oh, shit. Over and over and over again.
[17:31.590 --> 17:35.210]  And I'm just, like, giggling to myself. I think the lady thinks I'm ticklish. I'm not, you know.
[17:36.110 --> 17:44.490]  And it's like an 80-minute massage. So as soon as the massage is over, Emily and I are walking back. We look at each other and I'm like, how was the massage? And she's like, eh. And we just start laughing.
[17:44.730 --> 17:52.430]  We just start laughing again about the dude who took the dump. And we laugh all the way back. We get back to that common area and we sit down and they come and they bring us our water.
[17:52.570 --> 18:01.770]  And they say, you know, drink this water. Don't put your clothes on yet. Continue to stay. Stay here as long as you want. Relax. Detoxify. Enjoy being here. Don't be in a hurry to get out of here.
[18:01.770 --> 18:11.010]  You know, you want to, like, I don't know, settle before you leave. And so we're sitting there and we're just laughing. We're literally still joking and laughing about the guy screaming shit oh shit.
[18:11.070 --> 18:16.770]  We just keep saying it to each other over and over again. And out of the blue, my stomach goes...
[18:17.550 --> 18:17.890]  No!
[18:18.710 --> 18:24.950]  And Emily goes, oh my god, what was that? And I go, uh. And I get hit with a cramp. And I go, uh, I'll be right back.
[18:24.950 --> 18:40.430]  And I run into the bathroom and I barely get the toilet door, like, the stall door open. Turn around, pull my pants down. The second I'm hovering over the bowl, before I even touch, a shotgun of diarrhea comes out of me. Like, kaboom!
[18:40.690 --> 18:45.610]  And I go, oh! And it's like, I'm getting hit with instant karma.
[18:46.430 --> 18:47.730]  You've become the guy.
[18:47.930 --> 18:53.130]  I don't think it's karma. I think it's a time loop. I think you were putting your finger in the...
[18:53.130 --> 18:53.590]  Oh no!
[18:53.590 --> 18:54.370]  I thought that was happening.
[18:54.810 --> 18:56.730]  I was the guy in the shower and I never...
[18:56.730 --> 18:57.550]  Yeah, it was you the whole time.
[18:57.790 --> 18:59.010]  That never crossed my mind.
[18:59.550 --> 19:07.730]  Well, I diverted the timeline a little bit. So anyway, I'm like, uh. And then I have like two or three more shotgun blasts. Just heinous.
[19:09.150 --> 19:18.090]  Stinky and terrible. And I was normal. I was feeling normal. I didn't have any weird food or anything. And I'm like, oh god.
[19:18.090 --> 19:22.270]  And in my head, I'm like, well the only saving grace is I haven't shit all over myself, you know?
[19:22.530 --> 19:28.770]  So I like clean up. And it's a bad duty, but it's not... I didn't explode on myself, right?
[19:28.910 --> 19:34.110]  I don't need to take a shower. I'm like, the one thing I'm hanging on to is like, I am definitely not taking a shower right now. That's no big deal.
[19:34.890 --> 19:39.630]  And I get up and I flush the toilet. And I go, oh shit.
[19:39.890 --> 19:40.590]  Oh shit.
[19:40.670 --> 19:46.270]  The toilet works at like, I'm gonna say 18% toilet level.
[19:46.590 --> 19:47.670]  You found the old shit.
[19:47.670 --> 19:55.050]  I found the old shit. And I've dropped bull and cow and donkey shit at this thing.
[19:55.390 --> 19:59.410]  Like, I've made a mound. And it's like, siphoning off little bits.
[19:59.670 --> 20:02.850]  And it takes like a full minute for this thing to fill back up.
[20:03.130 --> 20:08.190]  And if you try to search that circuit and do it early, there's no like half power. It just drains the water and nothing goes out.
[20:08.190 --> 20:11.490]  I have to, I flushed eight times.
[20:12.630 --> 20:19.230]  And I still had about 20% of the fish flakes left in the bowl, right?
[20:19.630 --> 20:22.730]  And I don't know what to do. I just can't.
[20:23.550 --> 20:24.750]  I was hoping we'd get to that.
[20:25.110 --> 20:29.770]  I can't make it go away. And I've been in there for like 15 minutes now.
[20:29.870 --> 20:36.410]  And I'm like, the only thing I'm thinking is like, I'm gonna come out and Emily's gonna be completely dressed and waiting on me going, what the fuck is going on?
[20:36.410 --> 20:38.090]  Why did you take so long, right?
[20:39.270 --> 20:41.790]  And I just, I gave up.
[20:42.090 --> 20:43.750]  I just, I didn't know what else to do.
[20:44.050 --> 20:48.350]  I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried and I got almost all of the duty down.
[20:48.650 --> 20:50.410]  But some of it just wouldn't go.
[20:50.550 --> 20:53.130]  And all I could think of is like, this is a known problem for them.
[20:53.470 --> 20:54.470]  This happens every day.
[20:55.070 --> 20:57.370]  They're the ones, they should fix their fucking toilet.
[20:57.670 --> 20:59.190]  They got to expect this is happening.
[20:59.430 --> 21:03.170]  And I feel so terrible, but I just like, I just left the bathroom.
[21:03.170 --> 21:06.630]  And I walked outside and Emily is, hasn't moved.
[21:06.730 --> 21:10.750]  She's still in her robe and her eyes are like the size of dinner plates.
[21:10.870 --> 21:12.850]  And she's just looking at me and I go, hey.
[21:13.090 --> 21:14.770]  And she goes, I heard it all.
[21:15.010 --> 21:15.790]  I heard everything.
[21:17.490 --> 21:20.230]  She heard my shit was so loud.
[21:20.310 --> 21:21.470]  She heard my poops.
[21:21.870 --> 21:22.950]  She heard me moaning.
[21:23.210 --> 21:25.190]  She heard me saying shit to myself.
[21:25.390 --> 21:27.390]  She heard me flushing the toilet eight times.
[21:27.670 --> 21:29.590]  And then so I explained the story to her.
[21:29.590 --> 21:33.890]  And then she has to leave and go get dressed after she laughs at me for like a half an hour.
[21:34.070 --> 21:37.010]  So then I'm sitting in there and I'm just waiting for her to get dressed.
[21:37.090 --> 21:39.430]  And the entire time I'm like, please don't let a guy walk into that bathroom.
[21:39.550 --> 21:40.930]  Please don't let a guy walk into that bathroom.
[21:41.270 --> 21:42.430]  Please don't let him see what's in there.
[21:42.570 --> 21:44.030]  You know, please, please let us just get out of here.
[21:44.210 --> 21:46.230]  And then finally she came out and we got out of there.
[21:46.290 --> 21:48.290]  And I can never go back to that place again.
[21:52.310 --> 21:52.950]  Relaxing massage.
[21:54.190 --> 21:55.170]  Relaxing massage on a set.
[21:55.190 --> 21:57.970]  Yeah, did it really, really bring you down? Really calm you?
[21:57.970 --> 21:58.570]  Yeah.
[21:59.070 --> 21:59.550]  Yeah.
[22:00.050 --> 22:00.530]  Perfect.
[22:00.990 --> 22:04.110]  So you picked like laxative instead of lavender as the phrase?
[22:06.850 --> 22:12.650]  I don't know if it was some sort of a shit-atsu massage that I was not familiar with or something.
[22:13.150 --> 22:16.250]  But goddamn, dude, it was something about that place.
[22:16.830 --> 22:17.730]  It clears you out.
[22:18.270 --> 22:20.850]  You had some knots in areas you did not expect.
[22:21.050 --> 22:23.370]  You got denotted in the worst way.
[22:23.870 --> 22:26.870]  All I could think of the whole time is like, I've done this to myself.
[22:26.870 --> 22:28.470]  I made fun of myself too much.
[22:28.710 --> 22:31.730]  I crossed a threshold, like an invisible universal threshold.
[22:32.030 --> 22:33.810]  And now I'm paying the price for it.
[22:33.910 --> 22:35.390]  I shouldn't have laughed that hard, you know?
[22:35.890 --> 22:37.050]  And yeah, there you go.
[22:37.370 --> 22:38.490]  That's my Saturday.
[22:38.670 --> 22:39.410]  That's amazing.
[22:39.910 --> 22:40.490]  Oh my god.
[22:40.510 --> 22:41.290]  I'm so sorry.
[22:41.850 --> 22:45.950]  So was it overall, did you come away less relaxed than before you went in?
[22:46.210 --> 22:48.010]  Yeah, yeah, I definitely was worse for wear.
[22:48.750 --> 22:50.790]  100%. I mean, I was lighter. I weigh less.
[22:50.790 --> 22:58.070]  But yeah, it definitely ruined the effect of the massage pretty quickly.
[22:59.130 --> 23:01.890]  Oh man, that is brutal.
[23:03.070 --> 23:03.870]  Yeah, yeah.
[23:04.230 --> 23:05.590]  So what's new with y'all?
[23:06.530 --> 23:11.290]  I had a realization with Gavin that has helped me understand him a little bit better.
[23:11.910 --> 23:12.890]  Hell no, do I know about this?
[23:13.210 --> 23:14.470]  No, you don't know about this.
[23:14.610 --> 23:14.990]  Oh shit.
[23:14.990 --> 23:21.870]  In the recent episode, you described how your internal thought process goes.
[23:22.090 --> 23:24.710]  And it was very foreign to what I experienced.
[23:25.070 --> 23:25.970]  Just not very wordy.
[23:26.310 --> 23:28.130]  Yeah, not very wordy, more image-based.
[23:28.310 --> 23:31.170]  And it's just so foreign to what I'm used to.
[23:32.310 --> 23:34.990]  I was trying to piece together and I was thinking about it.
[23:35.190 --> 23:36.950]  And this isn't going to mean anything to you, Gavin,
[23:37.010 --> 23:41.170]  but it really helped me put things into perspective of how to view you.
[23:42.250 --> 23:47.790]  You are internally running a Chip Kelly offense, is what I realized.
[23:48.090 --> 23:50.530]  You and Chip Kelly, one and the same.
[23:50.970 --> 23:58.210]  Chip Kelly was a college football coach who had a run into the NFL, I'd say, maybe seven years ago.
[23:58.570 --> 24:03.490]  And his whole thing was, what made him unique, is instead of doing play calls,
[24:03.870 --> 24:07.190]  they would do images on the sidelines to do the plays so the players would look at that.
[24:07.490 --> 24:08.870]  That's your brain, Gavin.
[24:08.870 --> 24:11.270]  That is just how I imagine how you function.
[24:11.710 --> 24:15.970]  Chip Kelly, also known for a high-speed offense, you love high-speed cameras.
[24:16.270 --> 24:17.590]  It's just one and one.
[24:18.010 --> 24:22.790]  So I'm now thinking of you in the same context as Chip Kelly,
[24:22.970 --> 24:25.830]  and I feel like I understand you better now.
[24:26.110 --> 24:27.390]  It's not as confusing.
[24:27.650 --> 24:28.410]  That's amazing.
[24:28.790 --> 24:29.190]  I have context for you.
[24:29.430 --> 24:30.630]  And was he alright, or was he a wote?
[24:31.410 --> 24:33.750]  He did not last long in the NFL.
[24:34.470 --> 24:37.590]  All of the Chip Kelly experience did not translate.
[24:37.590 --> 24:44.110]  That being said, I believe that process is still adopted today by a lot of teams.
[24:44.250 --> 24:46.850]  A lot of teams will use images now instead of...
[24:46.850 --> 24:47.330]  Yes.
[24:47.650 --> 24:49.370]  So he had a lasting effect.
[24:50.190 --> 24:50.730]  For sure.
[24:51.690 --> 24:53.910]  I'd say Gavin does. I'd say Gavin has a lasting effect.
[24:54.630 --> 24:59.050]  Maybe not as lasting as your shit in that bathroom, Geoff, but...
[24:59.050 --> 25:00.550]  Gavin stays around.
[25:00.550 --> 25:05.170]  Someone on the F*** Face subreddit, Schwifty Oak, made a picture.
[25:05.490 --> 25:07.510]  Inside you, there are two wolves.
[25:07.630 --> 25:08.850]  So this is Gavin's two wolves.
[25:09.030 --> 25:10.310]  Gavin has two wolves inside him.
[25:10.490 --> 25:12.330]  One stands up and goes to bed.
[25:12.630 --> 25:14.630]  The other one has an external monologue.
[25:15.110 --> 25:20.570]  They posted it, and then they had barely only reply on their thread.
[25:20.730 --> 25:22.790]  They just said, internal monologue.
[25:27.610 --> 25:29.510]  Everything about it's a mess.
[25:30.470 --> 25:32.130]  It's been making me laugh.
[25:32.170 --> 25:36.450]  It's been making me laugh all day long.
[25:36.730 --> 25:39.550]  One stands up and goes to bed.
[25:39.770 --> 25:42.890]  I just keep walking around the house saying it.
[25:43.150 --> 25:44.170]  It's so funny.
[25:44.610 --> 25:48.350]  That's actually pretty accurate because I, once again this week, tried talking to myself.
[25:49.210 --> 25:54.650]  I tried one thing. I tried to say one thing, and it didn't even come out grammatically correct.
[25:55.850 --> 25:57.030]  What did you say?
[25:57.030 --> 26:01.930]  I had a pile of laundry on the floor, and I just walked up to it and exclaimed out loud,
[26:02.250 --> 26:03.490]  Tomorrow is chores.
[26:06.230 --> 26:08.850]  That has to be one of the titles of the episode.
[26:09.090 --> 26:10.270]  Tomorrow is chores.
[26:10.810 --> 26:13.770]  I was like, oh my god, it's not even a sentence.
[26:16.210 --> 26:18.250]  I really don't know how to do it.
[26:19.730 --> 26:21.210]  I've been having a communication nightmare.
[26:22.030 --> 26:23.770]  I've also been having the worst dreams.
[26:23.770 --> 26:27.670]  I've talked about how shit some of my dreams are in the past,
[26:27.710 --> 26:29.730]  where I just dream about my nightstand.
[26:29.850 --> 26:32.150]  I just dream about what my head is pointed at in real life.
[26:33.050 --> 26:36.030]  My cats have just been dicking around a lot recently,
[26:36.130 --> 26:39.050]  to the point where I've just started sleeping with my AirPods in.
[26:39.170 --> 26:43.830]  I'll just pop on a YouTube video and listen to something to fall asleep.
[26:44.210 --> 26:46.510]  But it's really making my dreams shit,
[26:46.930 --> 26:50.390]  because I can't hear what anyone's saying in any of my dreams.
[26:50.910 --> 26:52.910]  And I'm trying to listen, and I'm like, huh?
[26:53.570 --> 26:57.150]  And then I'll pull my AirPods out of my ears in the dream,
[26:57.650 --> 27:00.250]  and have them in my hand, and I can still hear the video.
[27:00.330 --> 27:02.850]  So I'm like, oh, no, no, sorry.
[27:04.390 --> 27:05.990]  They're still in my real ears.
[27:06.070 --> 27:08.010]  These are my fake, these are my dream AirPods,
[27:08.290 --> 27:10.110]  but my real ears still have...
[27:10.110 --> 27:11.770]  So it's like I'm in a lucid dream,
[27:11.930 --> 27:15.130]  but I don't do anything interesting other than try to explain
[27:15.130 --> 27:19.110]  that my actual ears still have my AirPods in,
[27:19.110 --> 27:20.090]  and that's why I can't hear anyone.
[27:20.510 --> 27:23.550]  And I've just had that dream like two or three nights in a row.
[27:24.530 --> 27:25.830]  It's so dog shit.
[27:26.390 --> 27:30.790]  Was there a movie at one point, or an entertainment property,
[27:30.990 --> 27:34.030]  where there were aliens living on Earth as regular humans,
[27:34.230 --> 27:36.950]  but they didn't know they were aliens, like they were asleep,
[27:37.190 --> 27:39.650]  and they were just living in human bodies as vessels,
[27:40.270 --> 27:42.790]  and then at some point it gets activated and they realize they're aliens?
[27:42.910 --> 27:44.110]  I feel like that's you.
[27:44.290 --> 27:46.870]  I feel like if that's actually happening,
[27:46.870 --> 27:50.710]  I think you're just an alien doing your best in a human body,
[27:50.850 --> 27:55.650]  and you're a super agent that hasn't been awoken by the mothership yet.
[27:56.590 --> 27:59.530]  It's possible. I mean, I'm definitely unaware of it, if that's the case.
[27:59.870 --> 28:00.090]  Yeah.
[28:01.810 --> 28:04.730]  I'm just so frustrated that I'm aware that I'm dreaming,
[28:04.850 --> 28:06.030]  and it doesn't even break the dream.
[28:08.130 --> 28:12.010]  Like I'm there telling people that I'd love to listen to them.
[28:12.190 --> 28:13.950]  I know it's not worth listening to,
[28:14.430 --> 28:16.210]  but I'm still trying to be polite to them.
[28:16.210 --> 28:17.170]  I don't know what's going on.
[28:18.490 --> 28:21.550]  Oh, I love you so much.
[28:22.990 --> 28:26.050]  It must be so boring to be you sometimes.
[28:26.890 --> 28:27.330]  Why?
[28:28.330 --> 28:31.690]  Just boring dreams. You got nobody to talk to when you're alone.
[28:31.850 --> 28:32.870]  You can't even talk to yourself.
[28:33.590 --> 28:34.910]  You dream about dreaming.
[28:35.750 --> 28:37.210]  You can't, like, just...
[28:37.850 --> 28:38.490]  Oh, man.
[28:43.690 --> 28:45.510]  We're in that busy fall season.
[28:45.650 --> 28:47.950]  There's so much to do. There's a lot going on.
[28:47.950 --> 28:48.650]  It's difficult.
[28:48.730 --> 28:52.770]  But one thing, thanks to our friends at Factor,

[30:26.170 --> 30:29.110]  What do you call a person who speaks three languages?
[30:29.790 --> 30:30.310]  Trilingual.
[30:30.850 --> 30:32.130]  Someone who speaks two?
[30:32.510 --> 30:33.210]  Bilingual.
[30:33.930 --> 30:35.090]  Someone who speaks one?
[30:35.450 --> 30:36.030]  American.
[30:36.490 --> 30:40.330]  Only 22% of Americans speak a language other than English at home.
[30:40.330 --> 30:44.490]  Start learning a new language this fall and be the exception, not the rule.
[30:44.810 --> 30:49.050]  Because with Babbel, you start speaking a new language in just three weeks.
[30:49.590 --> 30:52.350]  This fall, you can start speaking a new language with Babbel.
[30:52.910 --> 30:53.550]  Why Babbel?
[30:53.770 --> 30:54.730]  Because it works.
[30:55.230 --> 30:57.710]  Instead of paying hundreds of dollars for a private tutor
[30:57.710 --> 31:01.030]  or fooling yourself with language apps that are little more than games,
[31:01.550 --> 31:05.310]  Babbel's quick 10-minute lessons are designed by over 150 language experts
[31:05.310 --> 31:09.750]  to help you start speaking a new language in as little as three weeks.
[31:09.750 --> 31:13.650]  Babbel is designed by real people for real conversations.
[31:14.190 --> 31:18.270]  All of Babbel's tips and tools for learning a new language are approachable, accessible,
[31:18.870 --> 31:23.290]  rooted in real-life situations, and delivered with conversation-based teaching.
[31:24.030 --> 31:28.930]  Babbel's courses are so helpful because they help you learn real-life conversation skills.
[31:29.310 --> 31:33.250]  It's so easy to pick up on things like ordering food, asking for directions,
[31:33.710 --> 31:37.250]  speaking to merchants, without having to consult language apps while on vacation,
[31:37.250 --> 31:39.890]  which is something that will take you out of that experience.
[31:40.050 --> 31:41.550]  It just makes it more difficult.
[31:41.750 --> 31:46.250]  I mean, if I'm in France, you know, bonjour, saying hello to some people.
[31:47.490 --> 31:49.590]  It's, you know, you want it to be clear.
[31:49.710 --> 31:52.630]  You don't want to have to look at an app to say something as basic as hello.
[31:53.550 --> 31:58.430]  Studies from Yale, Michigan State University, and others continue to prove Babbel is better.
[31:58.910 --> 32:04.910]  For instance, one study found that using Babbel for 15 hours is equivalent to a full semester at college.
[32:04.910 --> 32:10.670]  With over 10 million subscriptions sold, Babbel is real-language learning for real conversations.

[32:31.390 --> 32:33.390]  Rules and restrictions may apply.
[32:34.450 --> 32:38.410]  Cold turkey may be great on sandwiches, but there's a better way to break your bad habits.
[32:38.890 --> 32:43.570]  And we're not talking some ridiculous belief system from some BS guru.
[32:44.090 --> 32:48.410]  No, we're talking about our sponsor, Fume, and how they look at the problem in a different way.
[32:49.030 --> 32:55.450]  Not everything in a bad habit is wrong, so instead of a drastic and comfortable change, why not just remove the bad from your habit?
[32:56.090 --> 32:59.750]  Fume is an innovative, award-nominated device that does just that.
[33:00.230 --> 33:02.790]  Instead of electronics, Fume is completely natural.
[33:02.790 --> 33:05.650]  Instead of vapor, Fume uses flavored air.
[33:06.150 --> 33:10.530]  And instead of harmful chemicals, Fume uses all-natural, delicious flavors.
[33:11.130 --> 33:13.790]  You get it. Instead of bad, Fume is good.
[33:14.090 --> 33:17.830]  It's a habit you're free to enjoy, and makes replacing your bad habit easy.
[33:18.470 --> 33:24.690]  Your Fume comes with an adjustable airflow dial, and is designed with movable parts and magnets for fidgeting,
[33:24.950 --> 33:29.650]  giving your fingers a lot to do, which is helpful for de-stressing and anxiety while breaking your habits.
[33:29.650 --> 33:34.670]  Another great thing about Fume is how it looks. It's beautiful, the real wood in the shape.
[33:35.010 --> 33:37.590]  It's awesome, it's something that you could really feel cool using.
[33:38.590 --> 33:44.430]  Stopping is something we all put off because it's hard, but switching to Fume is easy, enjoyable, and even fun.
[33:44.970 --> 33:51.110]  Fume has served over 100,000 customers and has thousands of success stories, and there's no reason that can't be you.

[34:13.790 --> 34:22.850]  I sent Gavin a clip of me talking to myself, and I thought, oh, I'll just record this and do what I would have done without recording it.
[34:23.130 --> 34:27.910]  And he refused to believe that it was real. He was like, this is not complete monologue.
[34:28.510 --> 34:30.950]  You said more stuff in five minutes than I say in a week.
[34:33.630 --> 34:39.730]  It was like a six-minute thing of I was just monologuing to myself, but I was by myself, I was alone, so I was just filling time.
[34:39.730 --> 34:43.270]  It was all full grammatical sentences as well. I was impressed.
[34:44.530 --> 34:52.930]  Maybe words are finite and we only have so many that we can say, and Andrew and I will someday run out and Gavin will still be going strong.
[34:53.670 --> 35:01.450]  Gavin is going to reach age 250 and you and I are going to be dead by 60. He is extending that mileage.
[35:03.290 --> 35:05.190]  We're not going to last nearly as long.
[35:05.970 --> 35:07.850]  It's going to be a different kind of podcast after we die.
[35:07.850 --> 35:13.570]  So the lonelier you are, the lonelier you get? Because all my friends will be dead.
[35:17.970 --> 35:25.570]  You're going to start the beginning, the first five years of your life are in total silence, and the last five are also going to be in total silence.
[35:25.950 --> 35:31.910]  Maybe, you guys remember Highlander? Maybe Highlanders weren't actually immortal. Maybe they just didn't talk enough.
[35:33.090 --> 35:34.810]  They just outlived everybody.
[35:35.390 --> 35:38.710]  Oh, that's a real dogshit movie, that one. I love it.
[35:38.710 --> 35:40.870]  A Thousand Words? I've never heard of it.
[35:41.030 --> 35:42.030]  I never watched it.
[35:42.230 --> 35:43.150]  No, it's about Highlander.
[35:43.770 --> 35:48.850]  Well, Eric just posted a movie poster for A Thousand Words, which is an Eddie Murphy movie.
[35:49.230 --> 35:59.110]  A Thousand Words. A fast-talking agent can only speak 1,000 more words before he dies in this feel-good comedy starring Eddie Murphy.
[36:03.250 --> 36:07.470]  That just sounds like a contract negotiation that became a movie plot.
[36:07.470 --> 36:11.670]  He's like, I just don't want that many lines. I don't want to say that much in this movie.
[36:12.370 --> 36:13.890]  It's very front-loaded, that script.
[36:14.550 --> 36:14.790]  Yeah.
[36:16.150 --> 36:17.870]  So does he end up just in silence?
[36:18.330 --> 36:21.210]  I'm sure he reverses the curse in some way.
[36:21.730 --> 36:24.130]  I'm sure he learns an important life lesson, right?
[36:24.390 --> 36:25.650]  Yes, absolutely.
[36:26.050 --> 36:31.250]  Hey, which Highlander is a dogshit movie? The original with Rucker Hauer and Christopher Lambert?
[36:31.830 --> 36:32.870]  Rucker Hauer's in that movie?
[36:33.090 --> 36:34.470]  The original, he's the bad guy.
[36:34.470 --> 36:35.510]  Oh, yeah.
[36:36.550 --> 36:37.910]  I remember Clancy Brown.
[36:38.510 --> 36:43.830]  There was a TV show and there was a couple of remakes, but I think the original was a pretty good movie.
[36:43.990 --> 36:45.750]  I mean, I haven't seen this as a kid, but...
[36:45.750 --> 36:48.490]  I mean, it's like shit good. It's not good good.
[36:49.570 --> 36:49.990]  Yeah.
[36:50.450 --> 36:50.810]  Watch it now.
[36:51.990 --> 36:53.350]  Was Highlander 2 any good?
[36:53.990 --> 36:55.010]  No, I don't think so.
[36:55.330 --> 36:56.850]  Maybe that's what you're thinking of.
[36:57.590 --> 37:01.670]  Isn't that the movies where they kept making sequels, but all the sequels were to the first movie?
[37:01.950 --> 37:02.730]  That sounds right.
[37:02.730 --> 37:05.210]  I don't think they should be allowed to do that. I hate that.
[37:05.270 --> 37:08.570]  I think Mario Van Peebles was involved at some point, right?
[37:08.770 --> 37:10.330]  Yeah, that sounds right.
[37:11.350 --> 37:12.530]  Maybe one of the remakes.
[37:12.870 --> 37:13.810]  Solo himself?
[37:15.770 --> 37:17.950]  I'll say it's no blast, that's for sure.
[37:18.110 --> 37:19.450]  Oh, we gotta watch Blast!
[37:20.090 --> 37:21.010]  That in the calendar.
[37:21.190 --> 37:22.230]  Doesn't come close to blast.
[37:22.810 --> 37:27.290]  Has anyone explored more Little Hobo, The Littlest Hobo since watching it? You go deep?
[37:27.670 --> 37:28.050]  God, no.
[37:28.050 --> 37:29.190]  Geoff, you've seen all season one?
[37:29.770 --> 37:33.910]  No, but I did see the new version of it you sent me, which looks pretty exciting.
[37:34.110 --> 37:35.310]  Simon and Rex, yeah.
[37:35.510 --> 37:38.490]  I love that there's always a dog show in Canada, it seems.
[37:38.610 --> 37:41.010]  There's always a dog doing something for someone.
[37:41.430 --> 37:45.610]  Do you think Canadians just appreciate dogs more than Americans do?
[37:46.950 --> 37:48.050]  I hope so.
[37:48.390 --> 37:49.570]  That'd be a great thing to claim.
[37:50.170 --> 37:51.670]  What? Didn't we have Rin Tin Tin?
[37:52.810 --> 37:55.630]  That was like a whole thing.
[37:55.930 --> 37:57.150]  That's a Christmas song.
[37:58.870 --> 38:01.350]  There was like Wishbone and stuff as well, right?
[38:01.450 --> 38:03.330]  We had Boomer, we had Benji.
[38:03.530 --> 38:05.470]  We've had a pretty rich history.
[38:05.790 --> 38:06.390]  Snoopy, yeah.
[38:06.610 --> 38:07.670]  And Snoopy!
[38:08.350 --> 38:11.790]  If we're talking fake dogs, you got Scooby Doo, you got Snoopy.
[38:11.790 --> 38:13.170]  We could have a whole fake dog draft.
[38:13.170 --> 38:14.290]  Clifford might be Canadian.
[38:14.930 --> 38:15.730]  Dog draft!
[38:16.450 --> 38:18.230]  Oh, you know, we also had Turner and Hooch.
[38:19.430 --> 38:21.410]  Now that I'm thinking, man, fuck Canada, we love dogs.
[38:23.170 --> 38:25.310]  We clearly love dogs more than Canada.
[38:25.310 --> 38:27.110]  How dare you?
[38:28.130 --> 38:28.870]  I never said it!
[38:29.010 --> 38:31.250]  I said I'd like to claim it, I didn't even say we are.
[38:31.770 --> 38:32.370]  Walk it back.
[38:32.530 --> 38:34.550]  There's no walking back, I never walked it forward.
[38:35.190 --> 38:36.510]  I can't walk it back.
[38:37.450 --> 38:39.810]  When does F*** Face Off start coming out?
[38:40.190 --> 38:40.650]  Monday.
[38:41.110 --> 38:44.670]  It's already out now if you go to f***facepod.com.
[38:44.950 --> 38:45.230]  Sick!
[38:47.630 --> 38:49.610]  Episodes have begun by the time this is out.
[38:49.790 --> 38:53.270]  I watched the intro and I fucking laughed and laughed and laughed.
[38:53.270 --> 38:54.490]  We put up...
[38:54.490 --> 38:57.350]  If you want to get a tease of it before you sign up,
[38:57.590 --> 38:58.590]  f***facepod.com.
[38:59.170 --> 39:01.650]  We put out the first 13 minutes
[39:01.650 --> 39:04.050]  like we talked about in the episode.
[39:04.330 --> 39:05.510]  So it's all the drafting
[39:05.510 --> 39:06.670]  and everything
[39:07.050 --> 39:08.750]  up until the baseball game.
[39:09.570 --> 39:11.550]  Does it just end with like, alright, let's do it.
[39:12.370 --> 39:13.610]  Yeah, it really is.
[39:13.750 --> 39:15.530]  And then it goes into the teaser
[39:15.530 --> 39:16.670]  for the thing.
[39:16.770 --> 39:19.870]  It's like a minute of us yelling at the baseball game
[39:19.870 --> 39:21.230]  and then it ends and I just went,
[39:21.230 --> 39:23.330]  That's great, man. We really nailed that.
[39:25.670 --> 39:27.430]  That reminds me
[39:27.430 --> 39:29.350]  of when I did
[39:29.350 --> 39:31.250]  the presentation
[39:31.250 --> 39:33.270]  for why I deserved the
[39:33.270 --> 39:35.670]  Cock Award. I shared my screen
[39:35.670 --> 39:37.270]  and I shared everything
[39:37.270 --> 39:39.290]  and I think it was edited out.
[39:39.670 --> 39:41.570]  I put jokes in all of my
[39:41.570 --> 39:43.430]  tabs, but then it was just
[39:43.430 --> 39:45.330]  the section in which I
[39:45.330 --> 39:47.370]  went to share my screen and showed all the tabs I had
[39:47.370 --> 39:48.810]  open was removed.
[39:48.810 --> 39:50.690]  Which then is alarming because
[39:50.690 --> 39:52.310]  of what the tabs were.
[39:52.770 --> 39:54.710]  I don't remember all of them, but one of them was
[39:54.710 --> 39:56.850]  like, child-kicking velocity was a search
[39:56.850 --> 39:58.770]  I had. I had all
[39:58.770 --> 40:00.170]  very clear jokes
[40:00.690 --> 40:02.790]  that I'm assuming just went unnoticed, but I could
[40:02.790 --> 40:04.730]  also imagine the editor looking at it
[40:04.730 --> 40:06.350]  just being like, ah, it's just personal stuff.
[40:07.070 --> 40:08.110]  He's just looking at this.
[40:08.350 --> 40:10.450]  I think I had Brainston Pickle as a search
[40:10.450 --> 40:11.310]  in one of my tabs.
[40:12.950 --> 40:14.670]  Oh, we better cut this out. We don't want to
[40:14.670 --> 40:15.490]  expose Andrew.
[40:16.870 --> 40:17.730]  So no one
[40:17.730 --> 40:20.290]  That's not that from a concept of exposing.
[40:20.990 --> 40:21.490]  I just think
[40:21.490 --> 40:23.530]  my concern was they looked at it and thought
[40:23.530 --> 40:25.150]  that is just what I would naturally search.
[40:25.250 --> 40:27.610]  And no one spoke to you about it.
[40:27.730 --> 40:29.610]  No, I just heard
[40:29.610 --> 40:31.670]  because I brought it up and then I heard later.
[40:32.730 --> 40:33.570]  Andrew and
[40:33.570 --> 40:35.530]  Gavin, did you guys see the special thing
[40:35.530 --> 40:37.610]  that happened on the break show that we filmed
[40:37.610 --> 40:38.810]  right this week? I don't know when.
[40:39.190 --> 40:41.510]  I heard something really exciting happen. I haven't had
[40:41.510 --> 40:43.470]  a chance to watch it yet, though. Dude,
[40:43.470 --> 40:45.530]  it was pretty fucking awesome. I bought this
[40:45.530 --> 40:47.330]  basketball blind box
[40:47.330 --> 40:49.510]  thing where you just get an
[40:49.510 --> 40:51.150]  autographed basketball. It could be any of
[40:51.150 --> 40:53.090]  a hundred different players.
[40:54.050 --> 40:55.510]  And we pulled a
[40:55.510 --> 40:57.390]  Shaquille O'Neal autographed basketball.
[40:57.510 --> 40:59.550]  Wow! Oh my god.
[40:59.850 --> 41:01.330]  I can't imagine anybody
[41:01.330 --> 41:03.250]  much cooler than Shaquille O'Neal to get
[41:03.250 --> 41:05.370]  a signed basketball. No. That's
[41:05.370 --> 41:07.070]  fucking awesome. Especially considering
[41:07.650 --> 41:09.590]  I don't know. I feel like we've spoken about
[41:09.590 --> 41:11.610]  him positively in the past on this podcast
[41:11.610 --> 41:13.670]  and I'm a big fan. It was pretty fucking
[41:13.670 --> 41:15.750]  awesome. That's so cool.
[41:15.990 --> 41:17.650]  That's my plug for the break show.
[41:18.090 --> 41:19.230]  And also it's just
[41:19.230 --> 41:21.510]  fitting because you got the Shaq attack on the desk.
[41:21.770 --> 41:23.530]  We've been foreshadowing this. I know!
[41:23.530 --> 41:25.630]  We put the basketball in the
[41:25.630 --> 41:27.310]  Shaq so that he was holding it.
[41:27.530 --> 41:29.970]  That's great! I can't wait to watch that.
[41:30.030 --> 41:31.690]  Really, really, really cool. Those break
[41:31.690 --> 41:33.730]  shows are really fun. I've really enjoyed watching
[41:33.730 --> 41:35.650]  you guys open those cards and it's good.
[41:36.030 --> 41:36.590]  Thanks, man.
[41:38.250 --> 41:39.630]  I've got a thing I've been
[41:39.630 --> 41:41.570]  doing in the background that nobody's caught on to
[41:41.570 --> 41:43.530]  yet that I've really been enjoying.
[41:43.710 --> 41:45.670]  I don't have the opportunity to do it a lot, but when I
[41:45.670 --> 41:47.610]  do it, it makes me fucking laugh
[41:47.610 --> 41:49.570]  and it's directed at one
[41:49.570 --> 41:51.730]  person and that person hasn't figured
[41:51.730 --> 41:53.730]  it out yet and I want to see how long
[41:53.730 --> 41:55.610]  that'll go on for. That's really funny.
[41:56.090 --> 41:57.690]  Are they on this podcast?
[41:58.630 --> 41:59.830]  They may or may not be.
[42:00.050 --> 42:01.670]  If they're not on this podcast, they listen
[42:01.670 --> 42:03.650]  to it. They're either on this podcast
[42:03.650 --> 42:04.470]  or they listen to it.
[42:06.650 --> 42:07.650]  Do you have
[42:07.650 --> 42:09.530]  anything that you have hidden, Gavin,
[42:09.710 --> 42:11.490]  throughout these that are just
[42:11.490 --> 42:12.490]  nobody's discovered yet?
[42:13.310 --> 42:14.150]  Throughout what?
[42:15.090 --> 42:17.210]  I think that's a no.
[42:17.570 --> 42:18.430]  That's a no.
[42:19.770 --> 42:21.250]  You don't have any of those.
[42:21.510 --> 42:23.510]  I have a few things that I've put
[42:23.510 --> 42:24.350]  out there that the community has found.
[42:26.430 --> 42:27.730]  Whenever I can,
[42:27.830 --> 42:29.550]  I like to throw out... Eric and I were talking
[42:29.550 --> 42:31.230]  about in something we recorded recently,
[42:31.370 --> 42:33.870]  the ARG stuff of Cloverfield
[42:33.870 --> 42:35.730]  was so much fun. Whenever I have
[42:35.730 --> 42:37.890]  the ability to throw an Easter egg
[42:37.890 --> 42:39.250]  or that type of thing out there, I do.
[42:39.430 --> 42:41.630]  I have a few that people haven't found
[42:41.630 --> 42:43.290]  and that brings me a lot of joy
[42:43.290 --> 42:45.230]  that they're just there undiscovered.
[42:45.510 --> 42:47.610]  What's the name of that
[42:47.610 --> 42:49.270]  game we're playing, the three of us?
[42:50.030 --> 42:50.470]  Immortality.
[42:52.110 --> 42:52.290]  By
[42:53.490 --> 42:55.670]  the time this is out, that is not out yet.
[42:55.770 --> 42:57.950]  That'll start coming out on Rooster Teeth
[42:57.950 --> 42:59.710]  first for our Let's Play
[42:59.710 --> 43:00.690]  channel because
[43:01.590 --> 43:03.730]  it's like, boy, is it
[43:03.730 --> 43:05.630]  our take on Funhaus? Boy, is there
[43:05.630 --> 43:07.810]  nudity. There's a lot
[43:07.810 --> 43:09.110]  of fucking in it.
[43:09.190 --> 43:10.770]  There's a lot.
[43:11.290 --> 43:12.410]  It's really something.
[43:14.170 --> 43:15.550]  Gavin, it's the biggest
[43:15.550 --> 43:17.370]  whiplash I've ever had with a video.
[43:17.970 --> 43:18.910]  Yeah, me too.
[43:19.410 --> 43:21.510]  I actually recently just played
[43:21.510 --> 43:23.350]  my first naughty
[43:23.350 --> 43:24.210]  naked game.
[43:26.170 --> 43:27.650]  Tell us about it, man.
[43:28.050 --> 43:29.450]  Go for it.
[43:29.450 --> 43:31.090]  As you know, Meg and I play
[43:31.810 --> 43:32.610]  Battle Chess,
[43:32.810 --> 43:34.990]  which is a game from the late
[43:34.990 --> 43:37.010]  80s, early 90s, where it's chess
[43:37.010 --> 43:38.570]  but they, like, have little fights.
[43:39.270 --> 43:41.210]  It's animated. Yeah, it's like in Star Wars.
[43:41.590 --> 43:43.030]  Yeah, I was like, I wonder
[43:43.030 --> 43:45.130]  if there's, like, a modern version
[43:45.130 --> 43:47.150]  of Battle Chess. And there is
[43:47.150 --> 43:48.970]  and apparently it's shit. But then in the Steam
[43:48.970 --> 43:51.110]  menu was a game called Sex Chess.
[43:52.830 --> 43:54.950]  And, uh, I thought it'd be funny
[43:54.950 --> 43:56.390]  to install that, but it's
[43:56.970 --> 43:58.630]  not funny. It's just...
[43:59.270 --> 44:00.250]  It's just sad.
[44:00.590 --> 44:01.570]  It's just horrible.
[44:02.010 --> 44:04.330]  I wish I could unbuy it.
[44:04.630 --> 44:06.110]  I don't get it.
[44:06.530 --> 44:08.790]  Well, the fact that you bought it on Steam...
[44:09.550 --> 44:09.950]  Yeah.
[44:10.430 --> 44:12.490]  Yeah, so you've played it for more than two hours.
[44:12.810 --> 44:14.450]  So clearly you've hated it.
[44:15.170 --> 44:16.490]  Have I played it for more than two hours?
[44:16.810 --> 44:18.530]  Well, if you can refund it. If you play
[44:18.530 --> 44:20.410]  for under two hours, you can get a refund on a game.
[44:20.690 --> 44:22.130]  Oh. Well, maybe I'm assuming.
[44:22.250 --> 44:24.750]  I probably played it for six minutes.
[44:25.850 --> 44:26.650]  Well, you're good.
[44:26.650 --> 44:28.290]  Yeah, go get that refund.
[44:28.490 --> 44:30.670]  Yeah, go get that refund. If he doesn't get that refund, we'll know
[44:30.670 --> 44:32.310]  he's still playing. Offline.
[44:32.390 --> 44:34.170]  It has been such a joy.
[44:34.490 --> 44:36.730]  And I hope, like, you know, in social media
[44:36.730 --> 44:38.670]  like TikToks or whatever, there's sometimes
[44:38.670 --> 44:40.730]  that annoying thing of, like, stick to
[44:40.730 --> 44:42.790]  the end. That couldn't be more true
[44:42.790 --> 44:44.510]  to our first Immortality video.
[44:44.710 --> 44:46.690]  Where I love that
[44:46.690 --> 44:48.630]  game so much, just genuinely.
[44:49.070 --> 44:50.750]  And you guys were not clicking
[44:50.750 --> 44:52.890]  with it for 98%
[44:52.890 --> 44:54.070]  of that first video.
[44:54.070 --> 44:56.290]  It is a non-stop
[44:56.290 --> 44:58.070]  train of shitting on this thing that I
[44:58.070 --> 44:59.950]  liked. So I was just rolling with it.
[45:00.070 --> 45:01.990]  And then it shifted and it
[45:01.990 --> 45:04.110]  connected with you guys. And it
[45:04.110 --> 45:06.410]  has been a completely different experience
[45:06.410 --> 45:07.970]  than video two. It knocked
[45:07.970 --> 45:10.310]  my dick completely off of my body.
[45:10.470 --> 45:12.070]  I could not believe
[45:12.070 --> 45:14.050]  what happened. I could
[45:14.050 --> 45:15.570]  not believe the corner.
[45:15.950 --> 45:17.450]  I turned on the whole thing.
[45:17.750 --> 45:19.750]  We played a second
[45:20.430 --> 45:21.830]  time, and I cannot
[45:21.830 --> 45:23.450]  wait to play again.
[45:25.410 --> 45:26.370]  Floored. Floored
[45:26.370 --> 45:27.850]  by this game
[45:27.850 --> 45:29.430]  that I shit on
[45:29.430 --> 45:31.570]  for 60 minutes.
[45:32.310 --> 45:33.910]  I think of all the things that
[45:33.910 --> 45:35.890]  you guys have recorded that I've not been in, this
[45:35.890 --> 45:37.310]  is the one I'm most excited to see.
[45:37.950 --> 45:39.750]  I was texting Gavin
[45:39.750 --> 45:41.430]  about it, saying exactly what you said,
[45:41.650 --> 45:43.310]  Eric, of I've never seen
[45:43.650 --> 45:45.530]  a bigger 180 from anyone
[45:45.530 --> 45:47.570]  with any game than you two with Immortality.
[45:47.950 --> 45:49.750]  There are sections of that
[45:49.750 --> 45:51.310]  second video we filmed that are
[45:51.310 --> 45:53.550]  complete silence because you guys are just like
[45:53.550 --> 45:55.630]  reading the text and getting wrapped up
[45:55.630 --> 45:57.610]  in the story. And it has made me so
[45:57.610 --> 45:59.630]  happy how invested you both are.
[45:59.750 --> 46:01.570]  We need to finish this
[46:01.570 --> 46:03.690]  before this comes out, though. I don't want you guys to get spoiled.
[46:04.010 --> 46:05.650]  Yeah, no, definitely I don't want to
[46:05.650 --> 46:07.330]  either. I'll say this about this game.
[46:09.030 --> 46:09.730]  You may or
[46:09.730 --> 46:11.490]  may not know that my favorite
[46:12.350 --> 46:13.590]  creator of all time
[46:13.590 --> 46:15.330]  is David Lynch, right? I kind of worship
[46:15.330 --> 46:17.450]  David Lynch above all else.
[46:17.450 --> 46:18.990]  All others. And
[46:18.990 --> 46:21.490]  I have... David Cronenberg
[46:21.490 --> 46:23.170]  has come close in the past,
[46:23.450 --> 46:24.990]  but I've never encountered anyone
[46:25.630 --> 46:27.310]  who is as
[46:28.410 --> 46:29.610]  lynchy in his lynch
[46:29.610 --> 46:31.470]  and a lot of people try. And I'm not saying
[46:31.470 --> 46:33.110]  Cronenberg's trying. He's his own thing.
[46:33.270 --> 46:35.090]  But it's the closest thing I can get to being
[46:35.090 --> 46:37.470]  of the same level
[46:38.370 --> 46:39.410]  of just
[46:39.410 --> 46:41.490]  immersive, weird, aesthetic
[46:41.490 --> 46:42.990]  and intellectualism
[46:42.990 --> 46:45.490]  and layers that David Lynch
[46:45.490 --> 46:47.710]  productions are. And this game
[46:48.370 --> 46:49.090]  has it.
[46:49.430 --> 46:51.430]  I've never... I've played all
[46:51.430 --> 46:53.250]  the games that they tout as like the Alan
[46:53.250 --> 46:55.490]  Wakes, all the one that
[46:55.490 --> 46:57.670]  Funhaus played for a while about the weird town
[46:57.670 --> 46:59.510]  and the person shows up that's supposed to be very
[46:59.510 --> 47:01.250]  David Lynch-y. It's fucking dog shit.
[47:01.770 --> 47:03.450]  Like, none of
[47:03.450 --> 47:05.070]  no other movie,
[47:05.230 --> 47:07.250]  anytime something is described
[47:07.250 --> 47:09.370]  as David Lynch-ian or Lynch-esque,
[47:09.650 --> 47:10.930]  it's always a letdown.
[47:11.250 --> 47:13.350]  This game fucking nails it. It is
[47:13.350 --> 47:15.570]  really impressive and it's really fun
[47:15.570 --> 47:16.690]  and it's
[47:18.070 --> 47:19.490]  bizarre. Just bizarre. I can't wait.
[47:20.010 --> 47:21.450]  Cannot wait to continue that with you
[47:21.450 --> 47:22.950]  guys. Yeah, me too.
[47:23.770 --> 47:24.950]  How many pots will it be?
[47:26.390 --> 47:27.270]  Three or four?
[47:27.470 --> 47:29.150]  I think... I bet it'll be four. Four.
[47:29.590 --> 47:31.350]  From what we did
[47:31.350 --> 47:33.390]  and what we found in this last one, I
[47:33.390 --> 47:35.070]  don't think that... I think we're probably about
[47:35.070 --> 47:37.210]  halfway. I bet we get
[47:37.210 --> 47:39.250]  pretty deep in three and then
[47:39.250 --> 47:41.290]  in four we get it about halfway through
[47:41.290 --> 47:43.290]  the video and we are... I bet we're gonna
[47:43.290 --> 47:45.450]  be fired up.
[47:45.910 --> 47:47.050]  I mean, that'll be a nice
[47:47.050 --> 47:49.410]  contrast between that and our thumbsticks
[47:49.410 --> 47:51.290]  videos, which I think will be 650
[47:51.830 --> 47:53.210]  points. Oh my god. Oh no!
[47:54.590 --> 47:55.050]  What?!
[47:55.050 --> 47:57.530]  We filmed two thumbsticks
[47:57.530 --> 47:59.330]  videos and we haven't won yet
[47:59.330 --> 48:00.910]  to get off of base sticks.
[48:01.150 --> 48:03.410]  We haven't even used my thumbsticks yet.
[48:05.730 --> 48:07.590]  We haven't made it to the final
[48:07.590 --> 48:09.390]  six times... Gavin and I just have
[48:09.390 --> 48:10.530]  had issues recently.
[48:11.370 --> 48:13.490]  We wanted to record... Finally something
[48:13.490 --> 48:14.930]  happened, Geoff, that I've heard about
[48:14.930 --> 48:16.590]  countless times from you.
[48:16.970 --> 48:18.490]  Your sort of reputation thing.
[48:19.130 --> 48:21.130]  Gavin, I thought it would be fun because Gavin and I
[48:21.130 --> 48:22.850]  play Halo Infinite all the time together.
[48:23.310 --> 48:24.650]  We haven't done any ranked.
[48:25.130 --> 48:27.370]  So I thought, oh, it'd be fun if you and I do a
[48:27.370 --> 48:28.890]  ranked thing and so we did it
[48:28.890 --> 48:30.870]  and we filmed all five games
[48:31.390 --> 48:33.290]  and we decided to scrap
[48:33.290 --> 48:35.170]  the video because we didn't have
[48:35.170 --> 48:37.450]  anything due to the fact that
[48:37.450 --> 48:39.250]  in game one and game two
[48:39.250 --> 48:41.390]  Gavin was trying to play using the
[48:41.390 --> 48:43.350]  large TV in his office that was
[48:43.350 --> 48:45.190]  in front of his face and he couldn't see
[48:45.190 --> 48:47.310]  and it was making him sick and so
[48:47.310 --> 48:49.570]  he had one kill in the first game
[48:49.570 --> 48:51.390]  and then two kills in the second
[48:51.390 --> 48:53.050]  game, which is horrendous for him.
[48:53.430 --> 48:55.530]  Like, this is a really bad performance, even for Gavin's
[48:55.530 --> 48:57.330]  standards. And then in the third
[48:57.330 --> 48:59.210]  game, he...
[48:59.210 --> 49:01.350]  You're welcome. He decided to
[49:01.350 --> 49:03.530]  grab an HDMI cable so he could move
[49:03.530 --> 49:05.410]  the gameplay to a different screen
[49:05.410 --> 49:07.450]  that he could use. But when he
[49:07.450 --> 49:09.650]  did that, he lost all
[49:09.650 --> 49:11.430]  of his footage for the first two
[49:11.430 --> 49:12.670]  games. Gone.
[49:13.390 --> 49:15.410]  So we lost two and a half games worth
[49:15.410 --> 49:17.350]  of footage. We have half a game
[49:17.350 --> 49:19.410]  there. In our fourth game,
[49:19.890 --> 49:21.310]  everybody on the other team
[49:21.310 --> 49:23.450]  quit, except one guy
[49:23.450 --> 49:25.350]  so we didn't really get anything there.
[49:25.890 --> 49:27.570]  So Gavin had a game and a half
[49:27.570 --> 49:29.470]  and so we decided to scrap our
[49:29.470 --> 49:31.430]  entire hour of footage that we recorded.
[49:31.690 --> 49:33.450]  Complete waste of time. That would have been
[49:33.450 --> 49:35.390]  a lot to cut as well because one
[49:35.390 --> 49:37.550]  of the people on our team was very
[49:37.550 --> 49:39.210]  unhappy that I wasn't doing well
[49:39.210 --> 49:41.530]  and kept writing a lot of mean things.
[49:42.030 --> 49:43.590]  And we kept getting matched
[49:43.590 --> 49:45.490]  with them over and over again so they
[49:45.490 --> 49:47.450]  had like a three game arc with Gavin
[49:47.450 --> 49:49.630]  getting progressively more angry at him
[49:49.630 --> 49:51.250]  to the point where he would like
[49:51.250 --> 49:53.330]  load in with us and he'd be like, oh shit!
[49:53.510 --> 49:55.610]  And just start shitting on me.
[49:56.210 --> 49:57.770]  And I'm there trying to
[49:57.770 --> 49:59.310]  plug in cables and like
[49:59.310 --> 50:00.390]  unfreeze my audio.
[50:01.710 --> 50:02.190]  So
[50:02.190 --> 50:04.490]  we lost that and then the
[50:04.490 --> 50:06.190]  next day decided, well
[50:06.190 --> 50:08.530]  let's do it again and we both
[50:08.530 --> 50:10.690]  made or used alternate profiles
[50:10.690 --> 50:12.690]  because I thought me being ranked what I was
[50:12.690 --> 50:14.730]  might like make it tougher for Gavin's
[50:14.730 --> 50:16.650]  ranking because they might factor that in
[50:16.650 --> 50:17.950]  so let's start fresh.
[50:18.150 --> 50:20.530]  So we both are on alternate accounts
[50:20.530 --> 50:22.470]  we get ready to go, we're
[50:22.470 --> 50:24.490]  recording, I do the intro for what we're gonna
[50:24.490 --> 50:26.550]  do, I set everything up, I then learn
[50:26.550 --> 50:28.730]  that you need to play a minimum of 25
[50:28.730 --> 50:30.790]  Halo Infinite games before it lets you be
[50:30.790 --> 50:32.130]  ranked. So we can't
[50:32.590 --> 50:34.670]  be ranked. So then we just
[50:34.670 --> 50:36.790]  decide to play normal Halo Infinite
[50:36.790 --> 50:38.050]  and that'll be the video.
[50:38.510 --> 50:40.810]  We finish the video, I have
[50:40.810 --> 50:42.890]  accidentally stopped recording my audio
[50:42.890 --> 50:44.570]  12 seconds into what we did.
[50:44.890 --> 50:46.670]  So we've lost two
[50:46.670 --> 50:48.850]  Halo Infinite videos, we've scrapped both
[50:48.850 --> 50:50.630]  of them because we just don't have anything
[50:50.630 --> 50:51.450]  to salvage it.
[50:52.110 --> 50:54.810]  We can't play Halo Infinite. The game that we play
[50:54.810 --> 50:56.630]  the most without recording
[50:56.630 --> 50:58.490]  without any issue, we cannot
[50:58.490 --> 50:59.550]  capture a moment of.
[51:00.110 --> 51:02.610]  So now the plan is to wait for the new season to
[51:02.610 --> 51:03.950]  start and then we can re-rank.
[51:04.510 --> 51:06.490]  So we can re-rank it. Yeah, I think the
[51:06.490 --> 51:08.170]  universe is trying to tell you not to play Halo.
[51:08.770 --> 51:10.410]  It is the equivalent of you two
[51:10.410 --> 51:12.590]  always, it raining, when you guys would get
[51:12.590 --> 51:14.470]  together. But that eventually stopped so
[51:14.470 --> 51:16.490]  I'm hopeful that eventually we will be able to
[51:16.490 --> 51:18.430]  record us playing Halo Infinite.
[51:18.830 --> 51:20.330]  I think actually at Austin summer
[51:20.330 --> 51:21.970]  just ended this week.
[51:23.410 --> 51:24.010]  It's over?
[51:24.010 --> 51:25.850]  What an amazing
[51:25.850 --> 51:27.230]  summer though. Phenomenal.
[51:29.090 --> 51:29.910]  According to who's
[51:29.910 --> 51:30.310]  metrics.
[51:32.410 --> 51:33.730]  Well, just weather metrics.
[51:35.410 --> 51:36.110]  I didn't
[51:36.110 --> 51:37.550]  understand what if he meant by
[51:37.550 --> 51:39.950]  worst summer of my life. What are you talking
[51:39.950 --> 51:41.970]  about? It was 107
[51:41.970 --> 51:43.930]  degrees every day. Everything
[51:43.930 --> 51:45.290]  in Austin died.
[51:45.870 --> 51:47.850]  I love it. I had fun swimming. You
[51:47.850 --> 51:49.870]  love it? Yeah, like out on the boat
[51:49.870 --> 51:51.910]  and stuff. It was amazing. I mean that was
[51:51.910 --> 51:52.550]  fun, yeah.
[51:53.010 --> 51:55.390]  The day-to-day, like
[51:55.910 --> 51:57.770]  putting the bins out and coming back
[51:57.770 --> 51:58.910]  sweating, not ideal.
[51:59.890 --> 52:01.610]  But I'm talking about what
[52:01.610 --> 52:04.010]  allows you summer antics was phenomenal.
[52:06.450 --> 52:07.810]  Getting in your pool
[52:08.590 --> 52:09.970]  when it was 94 out
[52:09.970 --> 52:11.190]  and you made the pool 94
[52:11.710 --> 52:13.690]  was a really interesting way to kind of
[52:13.690 --> 52:14.850]  cap off the whole thing.
[52:16.390 --> 52:19.730]  That was a great way to cap off a weird
[52:20.550 --> 52:20.910]  Here's
[52:21.530 --> 52:23.470]  how I envisioned that went down, Eric.
[52:23.670 --> 52:25.010]  I think it went down like this.
[52:25.510 --> 52:27.930]  Meg was like, they're coming over again
[52:27.930 --> 52:29.730]  and Gavin's like, they keep asking to come
[52:29.730 --> 52:31.490]  over every Saturday. And Meg's like, it's fucking
[52:31.490 --> 52:33.770]  summer's over. We gotta do something about this. Make it hot.
[52:34.050 --> 52:35.810]  Make it so unpleasant that they don't come back.
[52:35.870 --> 52:37.410]  And Gavin's like, yeah, we'll do that.
[52:38.230 --> 52:38.970]  Boil them out.
[52:40.150 --> 52:41.670]  Let's boil them like lobsters.
[52:42.190 --> 52:43.570]  Wait, you guys, he
[52:43.570 --> 52:45.530]  had invited, or you went to Gavin's pool and it was
[52:45.530 --> 52:47.570]  warmer in the pool than it was outside the pool?
[52:47.570 --> 52:49.570]  No, no, no, Andrew. It was the same
[52:49.570 --> 52:51.570]  temperature in the pool as
[52:51.570 --> 52:53.110]  it was outside of the pool.
[52:53.290 --> 52:55.490]  So when you stood perfectly still
[52:55.490 --> 52:57.610]  inside the pool, it did not feel
[52:57.610 --> 52:59.330]  like there was any water anywhere.
[52:59.670 --> 53:00.650]  It was just
[53:01.590 --> 53:03.750]  94 degrees across your entire
[53:03.750 --> 53:05.570]  body, no matter how
[53:05.570 --> 53:07.730]  deep or shallow you were in the
[53:07.730 --> 53:08.190]  pool.
[53:09.470 --> 53:11.650]  I just stood in there with you
[53:11.650 --> 53:13.030]  and your small wife and I just
[53:13.030 --> 53:15.450]  was like, look, I've never been a good host.
[53:15.450 --> 53:15.990]  I apologize.
[53:18.970 --> 53:19.610]  I'm not
[53:19.610 --> 53:21.390]  good at this. Some people have it,
[53:21.430 --> 53:22.590]  I don't have it. I don't know what I'm doing.
[53:23.030 --> 53:25.010]  It was legitimately
[53:25.010 --> 53:27.170]  the funniest way to like
[53:27.170 --> 53:29.210]  cap off summer that was so
[53:29.210 --> 53:31.330]  relentlessly hot to be like, ah,
[53:31.350 --> 53:33.150]  let's cool off in this pool. And it's
[53:33.150 --> 53:35.130]  walking in and going, what the
[53:35.130 --> 53:35.970]  fuck?
[53:38.190 --> 53:39.090]  You were mad.
[53:39.230 --> 53:40.790]  You were pretty mad about it.
[53:40.810 --> 53:42.210]  It was so...
[53:42.210 --> 53:44.070]  I mean, really,
[53:44.330 --> 53:46.350]  I was just flummoxed.
[53:46.750 --> 53:47.870]  I've never...
[53:47.870 --> 53:49.970]  It's just never been so hot out
[53:49.970 --> 53:52.210]  and then you get in a pool
[53:52.210 --> 53:54.030]  that is equally hot
[53:54.030 --> 53:55.930]  as outside. It was
[53:55.930 --> 53:58.130]  incredible. I've never done
[53:58.130 --> 53:59.810]  anything like that. It was really stunning.
[54:00.910 --> 54:02.290]  Thank you for the new experience,
[54:02.370 --> 54:02.510]  Geoff.
[54:03.490 --> 54:05.130]  I've learned from my mistakes.
[54:06.670 --> 54:08.110]  All jokes aside,
[54:08.810 --> 54:10.430]  even at 94 degrees,
[54:10.430 --> 54:12.110]  it is a joy to get to spend a Saturday
[54:12.110 --> 54:14.410]  with you in or out of
[54:14.410 --> 54:15.950]  a pool. It doesn't matter where I am.
[54:16.310 --> 54:18.370]  It was fun. We listened to the playlist in 98
[54:18.370 --> 54:19.270]  a lot. That was great.
[54:19.870 --> 54:20.290]  Nice.
[54:21.910 --> 54:24.390]  Hey, I have a question for you guys. I was talking to
[54:24.390 --> 54:26.150]  my video game buddies.
[54:26.770 --> 54:28.330]  We were trucking
[54:28.330 --> 54:30.430]  last night. We're up in Alaska now.
[54:31.170 --> 54:32.310]  We're going up to Pedro Bay.
[54:32.630 --> 54:33.510]  We were running...
[54:34.170 --> 54:34.610]  some
[54:36.310 --> 54:38.390]  long pipes up to Pedro Bay.
[54:39.550 --> 54:40.190]  Burndog had
[54:40.190 --> 54:41.990]  an eight-wheel.
[54:42.070 --> 54:44.390]  It was an eight-slaughter. It's the biggest thing I've ever
[54:44.390 --> 54:45.090]  seen in my entire life.
[54:46.990 --> 54:48.410]  They were sharing stories about
[54:48.410 --> 54:50.190]  hallucinating. Times they've hallucinated
[54:50.190 --> 54:51.450]  in their life from being ill.
[54:53.430 --> 54:54.250]  I got to thinking,
[54:54.410 --> 54:56.130]  I don't think I've ever hallucinated
[54:57.030 --> 54:57.690]  at all.
[54:58.070 --> 54:59.690]  I can't remember a single time in my life
[54:59.690 --> 55:02.250]  where I was ever in a situation where I hallucinated.
[55:02.330 --> 55:04.490]  Have you guys ever actually hallucinated
[55:04.490 --> 55:05.810]  and saw things that weren't there?
[55:05.810 --> 55:06.810]  I have once.
[55:07.610 --> 55:10.090]  Really? Yeah, I think I had heat stroke or something.
[55:10.550 --> 55:11.850]  I was on holiday and I was
[55:11.850 --> 55:13.810]  just feeling a bit in the sun too long
[55:13.810 --> 55:15.690]  and I went in to throw up.
[55:16.050 --> 55:17.390]  And I went into the villa
[55:17.790 --> 55:19.770]  and I opened the toilet seat and a bottle
[55:19.770 --> 55:21.950]  of ketchup fell out of the toilet onto the floor.
[55:22.190 --> 55:22.830]  I was like, Jesus!
[55:23.330 --> 55:24.870]  And then I was like, oh, there's no ketchup.
[55:25.890 --> 55:26.290]  LAUGHTER
[55:32.440 --> 55:33.920]  Even your hallucinations
[55:33.920 --> 55:34.460]  are boring.
[55:34.860 --> 55:38.080]  I don't know why I told that.
[55:38.080 --> 55:38.660]  LAUGHTER
[55:40.000 --> 55:41.660]  Yeah, that's shy, isn't it?
[55:41.720 --> 55:43.040]  What kind of ketchup was it?
[55:43.360 --> 55:46.580]  Just like a bog standard squirt bottle of Heinz ketchup.
[55:47.260 --> 55:47.560]  LAUGHTER
[55:48.160 --> 55:48.740]  Why?
[55:49.460 --> 55:51.320]  Did you just have french fries or something?
[55:51.720 --> 55:53.740]  No! And I didn't even like ketchup then.
[55:54.160 --> 55:54.960]  Oh my god!
[55:55.360 --> 55:58.090]  Your idle mind was thinking of ketchup.
[55:59.160 --> 55:59.700]  That's hilarious.
[56:00.220 --> 56:00.580]  LAUGHTER
[56:01.320 --> 56:02.960]  How about the rest of you?
[56:04.940 --> 56:06.080]  I've had like...
[56:06.080 --> 56:07.560]  Has anyone here experienced
[56:07.990 --> 56:09.080]  exploding ears syndrome?
[56:09.680 --> 56:12.480]  I feel like that's maybe the closest I've had to that.
[56:12.560 --> 56:12.680]  What?
[56:13.020 --> 56:16.060]  You just made me spit out all over my fucking keyboard.
[56:16.400 --> 56:16.780]  What?
[56:17.600 --> 56:19.600]  I have regulation ears, but exploding ears...
[56:19.600 --> 56:20.880]  It's like a thing where when you're
[56:20.880 --> 56:24.120]  waking up or falling asleep
[56:24.120 --> 56:26.140]  where my ear sounds like
[56:26.140 --> 56:27.340]  a bomb is going off.
[56:27.700 --> 56:30.060]  It's a sound that doesn't actually
[56:30.060 --> 56:32.340]  exist, but it ramps up
[56:32.340 --> 56:32.960]  in speed.
[56:33.760 --> 56:35.680]  Or in effect, I guess.
[56:35.860 --> 56:36.000]  Oh.
[56:36.180 --> 56:38.040]  I feel like I've had that with white noise.
[56:38.720 --> 56:39.980]  I've had that sometimes.
[56:40.180 --> 56:42.120]  You think you hear a bang.
[56:42.240 --> 56:44.300]  You think that something has happened.
[56:44.460 --> 56:46.040]  You hear it ramp up, and then you hear it.
[56:46.160 --> 56:48.120]  And then it's like, oh, I guess
[56:48.120 --> 56:49.560]  something is wrong with my brain.
[56:49.740 --> 56:50.600]  And then you go to sleep.
[56:51.120 --> 56:53.000]  Yeah, it's like it throttles almost.
[56:53.180 --> 56:54.860]  It increases and spikes.
[56:55.160 --> 56:57.740]  Is it kind of like when you're falling asleep at night?
[56:58.180 --> 57:00.680]  If you're half asleep, sometimes you can hear people talking.
[57:00.680 --> 57:02.400]  But you can't make out what they're saying.
[57:02.500 --> 57:05.080]  What? I don't have that.
[57:05.100 --> 57:05.800]  You guys don't have that?
[57:06.020 --> 57:08.720]  I think that might be a
[57:08.720 --> 57:10.540]  brain disorder. You got your AirPods
[57:10.540 --> 57:12.740]  in there? No! You've never
[57:12.740 --> 57:14.520]  heard that before? Sometimes it's y'all.
[57:14.740 --> 57:16.620]  Sometimes I can hear you guys talking. Voices?
[57:16.920 --> 57:18.860]  No. You're saying you hear voices
[57:18.860 --> 57:20.000]  when you go to bed? Yeah.
[57:20.760 --> 57:22.340]  Gavin and Andrew specifically.
[57:22.520 --> 57:24.820]  I can hear Gavin and Andrew. When I'm half asleep
[57:24.820 --> 57:26.260]  in my pillow sometimes, and I'm like,
[57:26.500 --> 57:28.500]  you know you're about to fall asleep,
[57:28.500 --> 57:30.100]  but you're not totally asleep, and you're just kind of like
[57:30.720 --> 57:32.480]  relaxing into sleep. I can hear in the
[57:32.480 --> 57:34.320]  background, real quietly, just people talking.
[57:34.480 --> 57:36.480]  And I think if I try to pay attention to what
[57:36.480 --> 57:38.560]  they're saying, I'll wake up, and then I won't be able to go back to sleep.
[57:38.620 --> 57:39.360]  So I'll just go to sleep.
[57:41.040 --> 57:42.360]  I don't know. I've never heard that.
[57:43.620 --> 57:44.480]  I've listened to
[57:44.480 --> 57:46.460]  stuff, and then suddenly the voices
[57:46.460 --> 57:48.440]  I'm listening to get all peaceful, and I feel like
[57:48.440 --> 57:50.200]  if I try and listen, I won't fall asleep.
[57:50.460 --> 57:51.280]  That's because I'm actually
[57:52.220 --> 57:53.420]  putting shit in my ears, though.
[57:54.980 --> 57:56.360]  My brain doesn't make it up.
[57:56.360 --> 57:56.900]  What?
[57:58.860 --> 58:00.500]  I can't, I don't think...
[58:00.500 --> 58:01.700]  Geoff, you have to go to a doctor.
[58:03.340 --> 58:03.760]  What
[58:04.220 --> 58:05.820]  are you talking about?
[58:06.420 --> 58:07.940]  Surely that's happened to y'all.
[58:08.580 --> 58:10.200]  No. No. No.
[58:10.820 --> 58:11.960]  Alright, well I...
[58:11.960 --> 58:14.380]  Listen, I don't know, I've never talked about it
[58:14.380 --> 58:14.620]  with her.
[58:16.020 --> 58:17.520]  You don't want to keep it that way, bud.
[58:17.800 --> 58:20.400]  I don't think I've maybe talked about
[58:20.400 --> 58:21.080]  it until now.
[58:21.500 --> 58:22.480]  Is she one of the voices?
[58:22.480 --> 58:23.380]  No.
[58:24.720 --> 58:26.520]  It's either people
[58:26.520 --> 58:28.440]  I don't recognize, or it's
[58:28.440 --> 58:30.280]  in my life, I can remember
[58:30.820 --> 58:32.600]  distinctly Gavin, Andrew,
[58:33.080 --> 58:34.000]  Bernie Burns.
[58:34.440 --> 58:36.100]  That's a particularly annoying one.
[58:37.420 --> 58:38.540]  So you like...
[58:38.540 --> 58:40.180]  I think I've heard Gus. People I know.
[58:40.260 --> 58:42.100]  A lot of people I know, and then sometimes people I don't know.
[58:42.760 --> 58:44.300]  So you've always had this,
[58:44.340 --> 58:46.400]  and then after you met me, one of your voices
[58:46.400 --> 58:47.080]  was British?
[58:47.980 --> 58:49.880]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[58:49.880 --> 58:51.160]  I guess so.
[58:52.080 --> 58:52.880]  That's interesting.
[58:53.440 --> 58:55.820]  I wonder if, like, are you sleeping
[58:55.820 --> 58:56.760]  and you don't realize it?
[58:57.760 --> 58:59.600]  Maybe, but it happens, you know,
[59:00.380 --> 59:01.140]  a couple times a month.
[59:01.240 --> 59:03.740]  I had one time where I, my dream, talking about boring dreams,
[59:04.080 --> 59:05.680]  I was laying in bed, my hand was
[59:05.680 --> 59:07.420]  off the bed, and
[59:07.420 --> 59:09.880]  it felt like somebody fist-bumped me,
[59:10.020 --> 59:12.040]  but nobody was there, and it woke me up
[59:12.040 --> 59:13.960]  and it was jarring. It was a general ghost
[59:13.960 --> 59:15.480]  situation, like Eric said,
[59:15.600 --> 59:17.840]  general whisper ghost. This was a general fist-bump
[59:17.840 --> 59:19.880]  ghost. But I woke up, I was like,
[59:19.980 --> 59:21.940]  who the fuck fist-bumped me? Nobody's
[59:21.940 --> 59:23.840]  in this room, what is going on? And then just realizing,
[59:23.960 --> 59:25.780]  oh, that was just a shit dream
[59:25.780 --> 59:27.640]  where I, like, felt the thing.
[59:27.940 --> 59:29.880]  None of that happens. So this could be, maybe
[59:29.880 --> 59:31.840]  you're just having shit dreams of people
[59:31.840 --> 59:33.760]  talking. Can you hear what they're saying?
[59:33.820 --> 59:35.440]  Or is it, like, just whispers that are impossible to make out?
[59:35.440 --> 59:38.180]  I feel like if I really focused,
[59:38.300 --> 59:39.920]  maybe I could make it out, but you'd
[59:39.920 --> 59:41.940]  never want to because you just want to go to sleep.
[59:42.520 --> 59:43.720]  But it's comforting. That's fair.
[59:44.040 --> 59:46.100]  Like, it's really comforting. I don't mind
[59:46.100 --> 59:48.020]  it. It's a nice background noise.
[59:48.400 --> 59:49.860]  It's weird that my voice
[59:49.860 --> 59:51.780]  making you feel comfortable, the story
[59:51.780 --> 59:53.020]  is making me feel uncomfortable.
[59:54.480 --> 59:56.040]  I'm looking it up, and I'm
[59:56.040 --> 59:57.900]  finding reasons you might hear voices
[59:57.900 --> 01:00:00.180]  at night. Lack of sleep.
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.280]  High temperature. Stress.
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:04.100]  Grief. Mental
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.500]  illness. Hunger.
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:08.080]  I bet you're just hungry.
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:09.300]  I don't think I'm hungry.
[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.680]  I think all the others apply.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.740]  I think it's hot where you are,
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:15.400]  and you have mental illness.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.680]  And grief.
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:21.660]  Well, maybe the comment leavers will
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.440]  back me up. Maybe I'm not the only one.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:25.080]  I really thought that was a common thing.
[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:27.080]  That's interesting.
[01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:29.580]  That's crazy.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.880]  We should wrap this one up.
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.480]  That's a real cliffhanger.
[01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:35.580]  What are your hallucinogenics,
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.420]  Eric? Wait, what?
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.920]  Mine are all from
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.820]  like, uh, drugs.
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.640]  So, like, they're not
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.400]  hearing things before
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.320]  you go to sleep.
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:51.800]  Drugs!
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:52.220]  Yeah.
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:57.660]  I don't think I've ever hallucinated on drugs either, though.
[01:00:58.180 --> 01:00:58.480]  Really?
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:00.680]  I don't think so.
[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:03.400]  No acid or mushrooms or anything?
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.500]  Well, I mean,
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.380]  you know, I was a teenager once.
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:09.400]  I've experimented in a...
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.640]  I don't like talking about it.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:13.340]  I accidentally did
[01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:14.960]  angel dust once.
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:15.560]  What?
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:17.320]  What?
[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:21.360]  I don't think I hallucinated
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.700]  there, either. Although I was fucked up.
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:25.840]  What is that?
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:26.860]  What?
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:29.820]  I guess it's PCP.
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:31.160]  It is. It's PCP.
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.820]  I thought it was two
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:34.740]  no-longer-continued flavors
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.760]  of Kool-Aid that you accidentally mixed together.
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:39.020]  Alright, anyway.
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.760]  Angel dust was a big thing
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:41.820]  in, like, the 90s.
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:44.100]  Yeah, well, this was when I was
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.580]  23 or so on tour
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:49.200]  with a band, and I accidentally did it.
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:49.400]  Yeah.
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:54.660]  I thought I smoked pot, and it was laced with...
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:56.460]  I mean, that's about...
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:58.840]  I know so many people that have had that happen to them.
[01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:00.640]  But I don't think I
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.460]  hallucinated then, either. Also, don't do drugs.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.720]  Kids, don't do drugs.
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:06.660]  Eric and I did drugs in our
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:07.960]  teens, so you don't have to.
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:10.720]  Learn from our mistakes. No, no, no. Don't listen to him.
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:11.200]  Don't do drugs.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.820]  And Millie, don't listen to this podcast.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.400]  You don't have to worry about that.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.800]  That's long gone. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 100%.
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.860]  Alright, now we should wrap this one up.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.220]  Alright, let's go ahead and cut all the
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:24.420]  Geoff did drugs once talk, and we'll
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:26.440]  see you next week for episode
