[00:10.260 --> 00:13.360]  I feel like Duck, Duck, Goose is a game that only gets funnier
[00:13.360 --> 00:14.540]  the older the players are.
[00:15.080 --> 00:18.260]  I want to see like 60 year olds play Duck, Duck, Goose.
[00:19.120 --> 00:20.520]  Do you use Duck, Duck, Go?
[00:20.880 --> 00:21.300]  No.
[00:21.760 --> 00:25.080]  You just struck me as the only person in my life that used Duck, Duck, Go.
[00:25.220 --> 00:25.780]  What is that?
[00:26.020 --> 00:28.060]  For when he's doing all of his QAnon related searches?
[00:28.300 --> 00:29.520]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:29.840 --> 00:33.100]  It's an independent browser that says that it...
[00:33.100 --> 00:35.200]  Are you tired of being tracked online?
[00:35.400 --> 00:36.960]  And it's like, I guess, yeah.
[00:36.960 --> 00:40.160]  We'll do it too, but we're going to pretend like we don't.
[00:40.300 --> 00:43.140]  You think I'm a private browser guy?
[00:43.480 --> 00:45.660]  Oh, no, it just seemed like a thing.
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.660]  Like the way that you use Discord in the browser
[00:48.660 --> 00:51.500]  is the way that I assumed you used Duck, Duck, Go.
[00:51.600 --> 00:53.700]  I have a confession about the browser Discord.
[00:54.160 --> 00:54.840]  Oh, my God.
[00:55.100 --> 00:57.340]  All right, Geoff, this is 181. Go, go, go, go, go.
[00:57.820 --> 01:00.540]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:00.760 --> 01:01.580]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[01:01.640 --> 01:03.860]  With me, as always, Gavin Free, Andrew Panton.
[01:03.860 --> 01:08.680]  And this is episode 181 of season 2-2, I believe.
[01:08.840 --> 01:09.940]  Hell yeah, we're back.
[01:11.240 --> 01:12.840]  Andrew, what is your confession?
[01:13.480 --> 01:17.560]  I, well, I've had a longstanding preference of the Discord browser over the app.
[01:17.640 --> 01:19.880]  And we've been doing Let's Play stuff where I've been sharing gameplay.
[01:20.240 --> 01:22.160]  And I switched to the app for that.
[01:22.340 --> 01:25.300]  And it crashes all the time.
[01:25.720 --> 01:28.040]  Every time I try to share gameplay, it immediately crashes.
[01:28.320 --> 01:30.960]  And I complain that this never happened on the browser.
[01:31.440 --> 01:33.000]  And I didn't know my password.
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.420]  So I couldn't do it on the browser to prove my point.
[01:35.500 --> 01:36.240]  So I just suffered through.
[01:36.360 --> 01:38.220]  I finally figured out my password.
[01:38.920 --> 01:41.780]  You cannot share gameplay in that way on the browser.
[01:42.020 --> 01:43.580]  It's literally impossible to do.
[01:44.580 --> 01:47.260]  So the app is superior in that way.
[01:47.500 --> 01:48.560]  I have to take that loss.
[01:48.960 --> 01:50.020]  Wow. I was wrong.
[01:50.940 --> 01:52.860]  Well, it takes a big man to admit he's that wrong.
[01:52.980 --> 01:55.800]  It does. It takes a season two Andrew to admit that.
[01:55.920 --> 01:57.520]  Season one Andrew wouldn't have admitted that.
[01:57.720 --> 01:59.180]  Would have quietly kept it under the rug.
[02:00.500 --> 02:02.520]  Hey, Gavin, real fast, I have a question for you.
[02:03.580 --> 02:05.720]  OK, how do you spell Poymal?
[02:06.220 --> 02:08.300]  P-O-Y-M-A-L-E.
[02:08.440 --> 02:09.720]  No, I don't think so.
[02:10.060 --> 02:11.660]  P-O-Y-M-A-L-E.
[02:11.880 --> 02:15.240]  I think it's I spelled it P-O-Y-M-E-L.
[02:15.380 --> 02:17.740]  But then I saw online a bunch of people spelling it differently.
[02:17.880 --> 02:19.060]  And on my way, doesn't look right.
[02:19.080 --> 02:20.440]  So I need to know a couple of things.
[02:20.460 --> 02:22.120]  Who are these other people spelling Poymal?
[02:22.560 --> 02:25.180]  Just people that were commenting on the episode last week.
[02:25.200 --> 02:26.160]  What about what about this?
[02:26.800 --> 02:30.480]  Poymal. OK, P-O-Y-M-L-P-O-Y-M-L.
[02:30.480 --> 02:33.680]  That looks like a like a polyamorous app.
[02:33.820 --> 02:37.620]  Oh, Poymal, yeah, I like it.
[02:37.740 --> 02:41.800]  And then, Gavin, what now there's six Poymals on the back, I believe you said.
[02:41.940 --> 02:43.200]  What do the Poymals do?
[02:43.660 --> 02:46.800]  Do they pulsate at all or do they secrete anything?
[02:47.160 --> 02:49.420]  Can they change the flavor of the secretion?
[02:49.420 --> 02:53.400]  They would have they would have a sheen and they would often throb.
[02:54.380 --> 02:56.640]  And they throb. OK.
[02:57.380 --> 03:02.540]  Uh, is there a scent or an odor or secretion of any kind or is it it's more just a throbbing?
[03:04.500 --> 03:09.520]  Shiny thing, I think it can secrete if the if if the conditions are right.
[03:10.140 --> 03:11.760]  Crete, if conditions are right.
[03:11.800 --> 03:13.460]  What are we talking about? Is this smut?
[03:14.060 --> 03:15.460]  Yeah. Yeah, I just need to get some.
[03:15.520 --> 03:17.440]  I just need to get some answers from them.
[03:17.560 --> 03:21.000]  So to help inform a certain scene.
[03:21.220 --> 03:23.220]  OK. OK. OK. If conditions are right.
[03:23.980 --> 03:26.160]  Now I'm going to assume the secretion is pleasant.
[03:26.640 --> 03:30.860]  For the Poymal or for the Poymal owner and also for the for the people
[03:31.340 --> 03:32.360]  inducing the secretion.
[03:32.600 --> 03:33.200]  You would hope so.
[03:33.600 --> 03:34.940]  Would hope so. OK, good, good. Yeah.
[03:35.000 --> 03:35.420]  You would.
[03:36.020 --> 03:38.360]  Can you imagine if this was the first one you listen to?
[03:40.140 --> 03:42.900]  Was this something that I was here for last time?
[03:43.060 --> 03:44.660]  Yeah. Yeah. Really? I don't.
[03:44.980 --> 03:47.900]  Well, after I waxed, I was gone.
[03:48.300 --> 03:50.320]  This was before. This is the episode previous.
[03:50.840 --> 03:51.700]  This is the episode that came out.
[03:51.920 --> 03:54.280]  The previous one we did. I waxed.
[03:54.300 --> 03:55.460]  What are you talking about? The one before the wax.
[03:55.460 --> 03:57.000]  This was the episode before that.
[03:57.420 --> 03:59.780]  Oh, OK. I just I forgot.
[04:00.120 --> 04:04.620]  We, Andrew, you and I said that we will not be participating in the smut.
[04:04.820 --> 04:06.920]  And yeah, I guess the reason why we don't remember this.
[04:07.320 --> 04:08.900]  Also, you got hammered online for it.
[04:08.900 --> 04:10.240]  And I got away scot-free with it.
[04:10.280 --> 04:12.200]  So I will continue to do that. Yeah.
[04:12.200 --> 04:14.700]  You can continue. Oh, I got hammered online for it.
[04:14.760 --> 04:17.420]  You got hammered online for no ending.
[04:17.520 --> 04:20.560]  And and Eric was totally scot-free. He's right.
[04:21.240 --> 04:23.360]  They only were mad at you.
[04:23.360 --> 04:26.540]  For for leaving due to creative differences for.
[04:26.740 --> 04:28.460]  Yeah. Yeah. For saying you won't do the smut.
[04:28.580 --> 04:31.280]  I was the first person that said wouldn't do the smut.
[04:31.380 --> 04:33.000]  And then you said, I also won't do the smut.
[04:33.080 --> 04:36.380]  And a guy online is like, I can't believe Andrew said that he won't do it.
[04:36.460 --> 04:37.300]  It was great.
[04:37.480 --> 04:39.540]  Hey, let me give you a speaking of the smut.
[04:39.600 --> 04:43.600]  Let me give you a quick little update on the smut and also on the anal waxing.
[04:44.400 --> 04:48.040]  We're having to record a little bit because I'm going out of town
[04:48.040 --> 04:49.320]  for a couple of weeks.
[04:49.320 --> 04:53.940]  And so I don't think we're going to be able to cram the anal waxing in
[04:53.940 --> 04:55.860]  before my wedding and honeymoon.
[04:55.960 --> 04:57.800]  So I knew this was going to happen.
[04:58.140 --> 04:58.900]  No, no. Hang on.
[04:58.980 --> 05:03.180]  Now, I am in talks right now with someone who is a friend
[05:03.180 --> 05:05.540]  who's a friend of a friend of the show.
[05:05.720 --> 05:09.400]  OK, so I think I can get them next week.
[05:09.480 --> 05:11.860]  Hope. OK. I'm attempting to right now.
[05:12.100 --> 05:16.600]  I will say that I have contacted two other places and they were like,
[05:16.660 --> 05:18.560]  yeah, we do these calls and this kind of cool.
[05:18.560 --> 05:20.240]  So we're trying to film it, do this thing.
[05:20.280 --> 05:21.580]  And they said, no, we don't do that.
[05:21.700 --> 05:24.220]  And I'm like, but what about OK, but is there anything that we can?
[05:24.340 --> 05:26.520]  And they said, no, we know we don't do that.
[05:26.600 --> 05:30.320]  And I just said, oh, well, we're going to we're going to need to get the sign built
[05:30.320 --> 05:32.120]  that we can put our legs in. Yes, correct.
[05:32.260 --> 05:34.120]  That is key. First, that's key.
[05:34.340 --> 05:36.240]  I'm told. But let me just give my availability.
[05:36.320 --> 05:38.960]  I'm totally down to get my butthole waxed before the wedding.
[05:39.080 --> 05:41.000]  It's just going to have to be Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.
[05:41.480 --> 05:43.500]  Do you want to be up there with an itchy crafter?
[05:44.460 --> 05:47.020]  I mean, if it's for content, yeah, it's.
[05:47.020 --> 05:52.220]  I mean, I mean, I want to do this because I think it's going to be really great
[05:52.220 --> 05:56.120]  for the show. I will say that if this affects the wedding at all,
[05:56.220 --> 06:00.160]  I think Emily will be in a way that I will never be forgiven.
[06:00.400 --> 06:01.440]  And I'm really worried about that.
[06:01.780 --> 06:03.700]  I'll slap some lotion back there and I'll be fine.
[06:04.480 --> 06:06.780]  I'm a I'm a I'm a professional.
[06:07.440 --> 06:08.440]  I can do this now.
[06:08.620 --> 06:12.600]  But because of we're getting ready for that, we've been recording a little bit.
[06:12.620 --> 06:14.300]  And so we're going to record two episodes today.
[06:14.460 --> 06:16.560]  So I just want to give the audience fair warning.
[06:16.560 --> 06:19.480]  There won't be a resolution in this episode or the next one.
[06:19.560 --> 06:20.960]  Hopefully the next one.
[06:21.940 --> 06:25.540]  But I just didn't want to I don't want to leave those hanging chads out there
[06:25.540 --> 06:27.740]  without without some explanation as to why they're hanging.
[06:28.000 --> 06:31.920]  Also, the smut story is on the way.
[06:32.000 --> 06:35.300]  I just had as a matter of fact, I just had a really productive meeting with Gavin
[06:35.300 --> 06:39.200]  about three minutes ago where I answered a lot of questions that I had.
[06:39.300 --> 06:40.840]  And so I'll get back on that.
[06:40.900 --> 06:43.500]  But once again, that won't appear in next episode either, probably.
[06:43.660 --> 06:46.220]  So so that one's hanging out there a little bit longer as well.
[06:46.560 --> 06:47.540]  But that's the future.
[06:47.800 --> 06:51.100]  That's the that's the nearest to to sort of distant future.
[06:51.600 --> 06:55.120]  Right now, we're doing episode 181 where we're talking about other stuff.
[06:55.280 --> 06:59.880]  Like, for instance, uh, I had an idea the other night.
[06:59.940 --> 07:01.200]  I want to see what you guys think about it.
[07:01.500 --> 07:03.240]  OK, I'm excited.
[07:03.940 --> 07:07.480]  You know how we were talking not too long ago, a few episodes ago about
[07:08.300 --> 07:11.880]  Andrew, you have exploding sound syndrome or exploding.
[07:12.220 --> 07:13.320]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:13.600 --> 07:14.520]  Whatever it's called.
[07:14.520 --> 07:18.900]  Yeah. And then I have the whisper, the whisper people.
[07:19.140 --> 07:21.760]  Yeah. And I was reading online.
[07:21.880 --> 07:25.240]  A lot of people, I would say like maybe 10 or 15 percent of the people online
[07:25.240 --> 07:29.540]  that commented also share the whisper thing and a little bit more have the
[07:29.540 --> 07:32.360]  exploding brain or exploding ear syndrome or whatever the fuck it was called.
[07:33.280 --> 07:35.340]  And most people are like, yeah, I don't know what they're talking about.
[07:35.420 --> 07:37.240]  I have no frame of reference for what that's like.
[07:37.300 --> 07:42.960]  So what I was thinking is, what if we made a track that people could listen to as
[07:42.960 --> 07:47.280]  they fall asleep, that simulates what you experience and what I experience?
[07:47.520 --> 07:49.680]  So it could just be really quiet for a while.
[07:50.980 --> 07:52.300]  And then and then you would hear like.
[07:53.400 --> 07:53.740]  Bang!
[07:55.340 --> 07:56.580]  Which is, I assume, what you hear.
[07:56.780 --> 07:57.680]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[07:57.740 --> 08:03.600]  It ramps. It's so it starts kind of quiet and then builds to the point where it is
[08:03.600 --> 08:06.320]  like a loud bomb going off.
[08:06.600 --> 08:08.360]  Can you do it? Can you do it with your mouth real fast?
[08:08.360 --> 08:10.500]  Yeah, it's sort of like it's sort of like like a.
[08:17.860 --> 08:19.900]  Sound a little bit like that crazy frog.
[08:21.700 --> 08:23.420]  I was the crazy frog, so.
[08:23.820 --> 08:24.920]  Well, what do you guys think about that?
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.560]  And then we could do another. We could do a whisper track where it's just like us
[08:27.560 --> 08:30.420]  talking like what I hear. And it's just that's just it's just it's just like, no,
[08:30.460 --> 08:31.280]  that's not ASMR, though.
[08:31.320 --> 08:35.520]  It's totally different because it's ASMR is for people to pretend like they're not
[08:35.520 --> 08:36.760]  jacking off to it, but they really are.
[08:36.840 --> 08:37.900]  This is purely to go to sleep.
[08:38.360 --> 08:46.020]  So it's like it'd be like whisper, whisper, whisper, go to go to sleep.
[08:46.180 --> 08:47.260]  And then you guys all whisper, too.
[08:47.320 --> 08:49.840]  And then we all do it together. And then people can listen to that when they go to
[08:49.840 --> 08:53.740]  sleep and they can see if it enhances or ruins their sleep.
[08:53.840 --> 08:58.740]  And then we could throw a couple of banks in every once in a while and and then
[08:59.380 --> 09:02.480]  create a product that we could give to the masses.
[09:02.940 --> 09:03.740]  This sounds awful.
[09:04.280 --> 09:06.040]  This sounds absolutely terrible.
[09:07.440 --> 09:08.140]  Why would I?
[09:08.800 --> 09:10.820]  I would say that's not the answer I was going for.
[09:10.820 --> 09:13.720]  Well, no, no. Just as a user is what I'm saying.
[09:13.800 --> 09:18.120]  I would love to make this, but as someone listening to it, that sounds dreadful.
[09:18.520 --> 09:21.140]  You're having a nice, comfy sleep and then people are screaming.
[09:21.560 --> 09:24.580]  Geoff, my exploding head syndrome is not a positive.
[09:24.880 --> 09:26.300]  I'm not psyched when it happens.
[09:26.580 --> 09:28.560]  But aren't you happy that it means you're falling asleep?
[09:29.560 --> 09:30.880]  No, no, I'm not.
[09:30.960 --> 09:32.400]  I'd just rather not have it at all.
[09:32.560 --> 09:33.620]  I'd rather just be sleeping.
[09:33.880 --> 09:37.500]  I find it so comforting to recognize that I'm falling asleep.
[09:37.500 --> 09:38.180]  Hmm.
[09:38.800 --> 09:41.000]  But there's no sleeping when this is happening.
[09:42.000 --> 09:43.700]  This it completely disrupts you.
[09:43.780 --> 09:44.780]  You have to get up for a while.
[09:45.220 --> 09:46.780]  Oh, you'd like to wake up.
[09:47.120 --> 09:48.020]  Yeah, you have to fully.
[09:48.140 --> 09:50.080]  It's not like you just drift through this.
[09:50.080 --> 09:52.000]  It's your your sleep is fucked.
[09:52.240 --> 09:57.320]  So you you're not one of those people that hears the comforting bang and then just immediately drifts off.
[09:57.440 --> 10:02.180]  No, I don't have Emeril in my dreams comfortably cooking me shit as I drift off.
[10:02.240 --> 10:03.460]  Well, I agree with Gavin.
[10:03.500 --> 10:04.680]  I think it's a pleasant thing.
[10:04.680 --> 10:10.080]  And even if it weren't pleasant, I feel like it could be informative to people who want to understand the experience.
[10:10.280 --> 10:14.320]  They may not want to do it every night, but they may want to put themselves in your ear shoes.
[10:14.820 --> 10:17.480]  And therefore we provide them the opportunity.
[10:17.820 --> 10:24.420]  Should that be a spinoff podcast, Ear Shoes, and we just do it like experimental science?
[10:25.480 --> 10:27.460]  Now, that's an interesting idea.
[10:27.620 --> 10:29.940]  Man, there have been a lot of ideas for spinoff podcasts lately.
[10:30.400 --> 10:33.720]  Andrew hit me with one the other day that I then tried to reinvent today because I forgot about it.
[10:33.720 --> 10:34.180]  What?
[10:37.160 --> 10:44.860]  His reinvention was so funny, too, because it was essentially 90% the same idea with a twist, with a slight twist.
[10:45.780 --> 10:47.320]  The twist was...
[10:48.500 --> 10:50.340]  The twist was just the kind of food.
[10:50.920 --> 10:57.160]  It's like if somebody tried to steal a script by just like changing the words, but having them mean the same.
[10:57.580 --> 11:00.160]  It was very funny, but like very clearly accidental.
[11:00.880 --> 11:02.920]  Yeah, it was very Armageddon deep impact.
[11:03.720 --> 11:04.060]  Yes.
[11:05.040 --> 11:11.480]  Can I say, just before we get too far ahead, I've never been more disgusted by Nick and what he said.
[11:11.600 --> 11:12.280]  Oh, OK.
[11:12.400 --> 11:15.220]  I said the bang thing and I made a reference to Emeril.
[11:15.620 --> 11:19.880]  Nick well actuallyed me about Emeril Lagasse or whatever the fuck his name is.
[11:20.120 --> 11:21.380]  He was putting our chat.
[11:21.620 --> 11:22.720]  Actually, that's Bam.
[11:22.920 --> 11:25.480]  Well, he didn't add the actually, but that's the tone of it.
[11:25.600 --> 11:27.840]  You don't need to correct over an Emeril reference.
[11:28.180 --> 11:29.380]  It was it was fine.
[11:30.040 --> 11:34.880]  Hey, if we're if we're walking back parts of this conversation, Gavin brought up Crazy Frog.
[11:35.360 --> 11:37.740]  Did you know that you can see Crazy Frog's dick?
[11:39.000 --> 11:40.060]  His dick's just out.
[11:40.240 --> 11:41.060]  Did you know that?
[11:41.440 --> 11:44.520]  Do you think if he ties it to another frog, they make a baby?
[11:45.100 --> 11:45.460]  Yeah.
[11:46.120 --> 11:50.340]  I didn't know that this is like all the images that I'm looking up for Crazy Frog.
[11:50.540 --> 11:51.680]  His dick's just out.
[11:52.200 --> 11:55.140]  Do you think Crazy Frog waxes or is that just how he is?
[11:55.840 --> 11:57.420]  How is his dick always out?
[11:57.420 --> 12:02.440]  It's I don't Gavin, I've never seen or noticed before all of these images.
[12:02.640 --> 12:03.460]  His dick is out.
[12:03.940 --> 12:08.460]  It's just like a Mandela thing where his dick was never out, but now it's always been out.
[12:08.700 --> 12:09.080]  Look.
[12:09.360 --> 12:10.540]  Oh, it's definitely out of now.
[12:10.540 --> 12:11.580]  It's out, dude.
[12:13.680 --> 12:15.060]  What the fuck?
[12:15.240 --> 12:16.660]  Yeah, I think Nick has a good point.
[12:16.740 --> 12:19.500]  The videos were lower quality because they were on like that.
[12:19.620 --> 12:20.000]  Yes.
[12:20.120 --> 12:21.080]  Nokia twos.
[12:21.220 --> 12:23.300]  So like, yeah, you can't see.
[12:23.500 --> 12:27.220]  Can I quickly ask Nick how he felt about the conversation?
[12:28.360 --> 12:30.540]  At the beginning of the episode, he wasn't in.
[12:30.940 --> 12:31.340]  Bless you.
[12:31.620 --> 12:32.180]  Oh, terrible.
[12:32.500 --> 12:36.000]  I was I was putting it together to send to Kelly, who edits a lot of these.
[12:36.140 --> 12:39.620]  And I just sat there like, well, yeah, they are weird looking feet.
[12:42.920 --> 12:45.020]  And then I was like, why was I wearing sandals?
[12:45.080 --> 12:45.820]  And then I remember it.
[12:45.860 --> 12:48.580]  I'd ripped my heels open with the new shoes I'd bought.
[12:48.620 --> 12:50.200]  So I was like, well, I'll just get my feet to rest.
[12:51.040 --> 12:51.860]  Wasn't that a mistake?
[12:53.020 --> 12:53.380]  Interesting.
[12:54.740 --> 12:55.740]  It was so white.
[12:56.180 --> 12:58.240]  I just found a dickless crazy frog.
[12:58.440 --> 12:58.940]  Thanks, man.
[12:59.560 --> 13:03.080]  Yeah, but that's on the cover of PS2 game.
[13:03.160 --> 13:03.320]  Yeah.
[13:03.340 --> 13:05.040]  Do you think they took off the dick for?
[13:05.460 --> 13:06.100]  A hundred percent.
[13:06.480 --> 13:09.140]  I love that they have a meeting about that.
[13:09.220 --> 13:09.980]  But there is a decision.
[13:10.220 --> 13:11.540]  Some artists had to take the dick out.
[13:11.720 --> 13:11.860]  Yeah.
[13:14.540 --> 13:15.340]  That's crazy.
[13:16.940 --> 13:18.220]  They airbrushed his dick.
[13:18.340 --> 13:18.840]  That's awesome.
[13:19.580 --> 13:21.720]  Hey, Nick, I'm sorry about the foot chatter.
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.420]  For the record, I think it was probably the angle of the photo.
[13:24.420 --> 13:26.540]  You don't have kangaroo feet.
[13:27.620 --> 13:28.800]  Well, they were dog feet.
[13:29.600 --> 13:32.680]  Yeah, but somebody online said kangaroo, and I thought that actually fit better.
[13:34.680 --> 13:36.660]  We can apologize to you, Nick.
[13:36.700 --> 13:38.960]  And you can apologize to every other person in the park.
[13:39.240 --> 13:40.720]  We can just do all a big apology.
[13:41.600 --> 13:42.720]  I'm sorry to all.
[13:42.760 --> 13:43.760]  We can knock it off.
[13:44.520 --> 13:50.240]  I realized that the real kicker was that Kelly was out for the video export.
[13:50.360 --> 13:51.600]  So I had to put together the video.
[13:51.600 --> 13:55.360]  And I was like, staring at my picture, like, they just keep talking about it.
[13:55.400 --> 13:56.240]  They just keep going.
[13:57.320 --> 14:00.380]  So I just had to keep dragging it on the timeline of the premiere project.
[14:07.580 --> 14:10.740]  Andrew, do you want to talk about your idea for a podcast?
[14:10.960 --> 14:12.080]  Or do you just want to do it someday?
[14:12.500 --> 14:13.840]  I think we should just do it someday.
[14:14.080 --> 14:15.720]  And I view it as not even a separate thing.
[14:15.780 --> 14:16.800]  Just as like a supplemental.
[14:17.160 --> 14:17.940]  A supplemental, yeah.
[14:17.980 --> 14:21.580]  Like a boring, but...
[14:22.060 --> 14:25.800]  Can I just say, for the record, because we're not going to talk about what the idea is.
[14:25.920 --> 14:29.000]  I am going to say it definitively has nothing to do with sandwiches.
[14:29.880 --> 14:30.240]  No.
[14:30.580 --> 14:31.340]  No, it does not.
[14:31.800 --> 14:33.080]  Not a sandwich podcast.
[14:33.380 --> 14:33.980]  It's not.
[14:34.120 --> 14:36.180]  Although we had a great conversation today about sandwiches.
[14:36.400 --> 14:36.940]  We did.
[14:37.140 --> 14:39.620]  I was, I've been having, I had sandwiches on the brain lately.
[14:40.300 --> 14:43.040]  And I was thinking, I was actually thinking about pastrami.
[14:43.100 --> 14:44.540]  I was thinking about getting a pastrami sandwich today.
[14:45.020 --> 14:48.200]  And I ultimately didn't because I didn't want to drive to that side of town because it was raining.
[14:49.700 --> 14:54.940]  But I got to thinking, what is the biggest impression a sandwich has ever left on you?
[14:55.760 --> 14:59.740]  And because for me, pastrami, it kind of flipped my whole world around.
[15:00.040 --> 15:05.000]  And it's not often that you pick up something like a sandwich and it changes your worldview.
[15:05.140 --> 15:06.600]  At least even for a little while.
[15:06.740 --> 15:12.040]  And so I was wondering, has there ever been a sandwich that has affected y'all in similar fashion?
[15:12.040 --> 15:14.940]  Or if so, what is like, what's the sandwich that changed your life?
[15:15.640 --> 15:16.640]  Do you have an answer, Gavin?
[15:17.680 --> 15:23.980]  Um, I feel like the biggest step up from normal sandwiches to a, to a sandwich where I was like,
[15:24.040 --> 15:26.880]  wow, this is, this is huge, a huge improvement.
[15:27.120 --> 15:28.700]  I would say it was a meatball sandwich.
[15:29.520 --> 15:29.960]  Really?
[15:31.260 --> 15:34.760]  Was it like the first time you'd had one or you just had a particularly good one?
[15:35.940 --> 15:38.400]  Um, I think it was the first time I went to Subway.
[15:39.560 --> 15:41.980]  I had a good experience at Subway.
[15:42.360 --> 15:42.960]  Fair enough.
[15:44.160 --> 15:49.000]  And, uh, yeah, we, I, and then it became a tradition of watching movies.
[15:49.140 --> 15:52.900]  I would just go to a Subway, get a footlong meatball, stuff it in my coat,
[15:53.080 --> 15:55.840]  and then, uh, pull it out in the, in the movies.
[15:57.220 --> 15:59.660]  Oh, you'd sneak the Subway sandwich into a movie theater?
[16:00.180 --> 16:00.480]  Yeah.
[16:00.860 --> 16:01.960]  A full footlong.
[16:02.080 --> 16:05.320]  Yeah, I had a big inside pocket that would perfectly fit a footlong.
[16:09.150 --> 16:13.470]  Can I tell you guys a story about a Subway sandwich that I didn't, I just...
[16:13.470 --> 16:15.770]  Subway sandwich just popped into my head that I haven't thought about.
[16:16.030 --> 16:16.110]  Please!
[16:17.330 --> 16:21.130]  When I was in high school, you know, I've talked a lot about how I would go to the McDonald's
[16:21.130 --> 16:22.770]  in the mall and make fun of people.
[16:23.830 --> 16:25.710]  There was also a Subway there.
[16:25.990 --> 16:28.410]  And so when we had a little bit more money, because Subway is a little bit more expensive,
[16:28.530 --> 16:33.250]  honestly, uh, when we had a, when we had the Subway money, I would, uh, we would sometimes
[16:33.250 --> 16:34.710]  go to Subway and get sandwiches there.
[16:34.730 --> 16:39.390]  And one night we were sitting in the Subway and a dude walked in, in one of these, I'm
[16:39.390 --> 16:42.650]  going to send you a picture, uh, this, I just call them puffy NFL jackets.
[16:42.650 --> 16:46.470]  Every kid in my high school, everybody on earth had one of these jackets when I was
[16:46.470 --> 16:46.850]  in high school.
[16:46.970 --> 16:47.530]  I had one too.
[16:48.130 --> 16:51.290]  Mine was the Cowboys, even though I didn't like the Cowboys, but it just was like the
[16:51.290 --> 16:51.830]  jacket you had.
[16:52.310 --> 16:56.590]  And so there was a dude who had one of those and he walked in and he was, he ordered a
[16:56.590 --> 16:58.070]  sandwich and he was waiting for a sandwich.
[16:58.330 --> 17:03.770]  And then he leaned up against the wall, but his jacket was so puffy that the backside
[17:03.770 --> 17:09.710]  of it, he was leaning up right next to the soda machine and the back of his jacket or
[17:09.710 --> 17:16.310]  his elbow or something caught the like Dr. Pepper and it was just going and it was pouring
[17:16.310 --> 17:19.970]  all down the back of his jacket, but he was at like an angle, so it wasn't like hitting
[17:19.970 --> 17:21.790]  his pants, it was just hitting the ground.
[17:22.390 --> 17:27.630]  And my friends and I saw it and we started to laugh, I started to laugh like uncontrollably
[17:28.070 --> 17:31.770]  and all I could do was point at him and I was trying to get his attention to tell him
[17:31.770 --> 17:35.150]  to move and all we could do is point at him and the guy looked over his shoulder at us
[17:35.150 --> 17:38.550]  and saw us laughing and pointing at him and he just like got angry, made an angry face
[17:38.550 --> 17:42.710]  and turned back away and he stayed there like he like screwed up and stayed there
[17:42.710 --> 17:46.390]  even longer and he was building up, there was like a puddle forming around him.
[17:46.430 --> 17:47.290]  Did you hear it?
[17:47.990 --> 17:52.070]  I don't know, dude, it wasn't super loud and we were laughing so fucking, I was like
[17:52.070 --> 17:57.450]  wheezing and I was, you know, I couldn't fucking breathe and the guy and my friends
[17:57.450 --> 18:01.170]  next to me were fucking laughing and howling and shit too, so even if it made a noise,
[18:01.230 --> 18:03.090]  I don't think anybody on earth could have heard it.
[18:03.090 --> 18:09.030]  And then eventually another, like another customer walked over and like, just like,
[18:09.170 --> 18:12.350]  he was like, he like didn't want anything to do with anybody, he thought he was being
[18:12.350 --> 18:15.930]  made fun of, so he like, he was like face towards the wall and somebody had to like
[18:15.930 --> 18:19.290]  pull on his arm and he turned around and they were like, you're spilling, and he looked
[18:19.290 --> 18:23.690]  and he was in like 48 gallons of soda, but I had, I don't think I thought about that
[18:23.690 --> 18:26.130]  since I was 16 years old until this moment.
[18:26.910 --> 18:31.190]  It was like maybe 40 seconds long of just straight soda.
[18:32.070 --> 18:36.250]  The jacket you sent has a hood on it. I thought you were going to say that like it started
[18:36.250 --> 18:41.570]  filling his hood, like he had the hood off and he just didn't notice. That'd be so fucking
[18:41.570 --> 18:43.270]  funny to have a hood full of soda and not be like...
[18:43.270 --> 18:46.870]  That'd be such a shock if he just walked out and pulled the hood off.
[18:46.950 --> 18:53.670]  His jacket was like 80% soda by the end of it though. It was just, he was just drenched
[18:53.670 --> 18:55.970]  and it was like splashing everywhere. Oh, that's great.
[18:56.510 --> 18:57.490]  Oh, that's so good.
[18:57.950 --> 19:00.930]  Do you think you laughed more in the past than you do now?
[19:00.930 --> 19:05.410]  I just feel like when I was a kid, there were things that were so funny. I almost couldn't
[19:05.410 --> 19:11.830]  believe it. I was once messing around in, in IT class and, uh, my friend threw like
[19:11.830 --> 19:17.370]  a board rubber, like an eraser at my face. It hit me in the mouth. And then I spent the
[19:17.370 --> 19:23.350]  rest, I spent the rest of the lesson trying to throw stuff at him. And I took the roller
[19:23.350 --> 19:30.650]  ball. I took the ball out of my mouth, uh, showing my age there. And I, and I threw it
[19:30.650 --> 19:34.930]  at him and it got, it was like right as he was like standing up or something and it got
[19:34.930 --> 19:43.150]  lodged in his belly button. It like, he lifted up, his shirt like lifted up just enough and
[19:43.150 --> 19:52.130]  it went in, inside him. And he couldn't get it out for like two minutes. And I can't, and
[19:52.130 --> 19:56.950]  I could not, I couldn't stand up. I was just crying, rolling around. I was like trying
[19:56.950 --> 20:01.190]  to stand up and like falling into stuff. I was laughing so much. You had like the Death
[20:01.190 --> 20:07.630]  Star kill shot. Like that's the one in a million, the one weak point that that guy had. I just
[20:07.630 --> 20:15.050]  feel like, do you think that's ever happened to anyone else? No, I think that's the only
[20:15.050 --> 20:22.230]  time in human history, ever happened. I think that that window closed and it's not, it can't
[20:22.230 --> 20:27.890]  ever happen again. Oh my God, dude. That's fucking funny. I don't, I think that stuff
[20:27.890 --> 20:33.330]  was funnier maybe, but more, more stuff is funny now, if that makes sense. Also, like
[20:33.330 --> 20:39.270]  I mentioned about how when I was in high school, my favorite thing on earth to do was to go
[20:39.270 --> 20:43.710]  sit in that McDonald's facing out towards the mall and make fun of people. And I saw
[20:43.710 --> 20:47.290]  somebody in a comment recently say, that's all Sloppy Joe's bingo is, is just Geoff still
[20:47.290 --> 20:51.550]  being 16 years old and getting to look out a window and make fun of people. And I think,
[20:51.790 --> 20:56.550]  I think to be completely and totally honest with you, I think I like to laugh more than
[20:56.550 --> 21:00.330]  anything else on earth. And since I figured that out at a young age, it's all I've cared
[21:00.330 --> 21:05.690]  about. And so I feel like I have made sure that I get to continue to laugh every day
[21:05.690 --> 21:09.970]  and I've built a career around it just so that I can laugh. So I probably laugh more
[21:09.970 --> 21:14.210]  now. Have you ever woken up from laughter? Like you were laughing in your dream and
[21:14.210 --> 21:19.070]  you woke up from the laughing? I don't think I have. It's the best. It happens to me pretty
[21:19.070 --> 21:24.450]  frequently. It's so good. I think my dreams aren't funny. Oh, that doesn't stop it. Why
[21:24.450 --> 21:29.150]  would they be? Your waking hours aren't particularly funny either. Your dreams sound like a nightmare,
[21:29.690 --> 21:34.350]  Gavin. You're just filling your stomach with fart air from what I understand is your sleep.
[21:34.350 --> 21:41.290]  Which is funny, but I probably not to experience. I have dreams where I wake up laughing and
[21:41.290 --> 21:44.830]  a lot of the times when I wake up and I think about what was funny in the dream, not nearly
[21:44.830 --> 21:50.330]  as funny as it was in the dream world in real life. But it is a great way to wake up. Do
[21:50.330 --> 21:55.130]  you think you're just more affected by dreams because you you wake up from laughing from
[21:55.130 --> 21:58.910]  funny dreams? But you also recently told us a story that you were depressed because you
[21:58.910 --> 22:05.330]  woke up. You had shame section, right? Yes, because you had you were telling unfunny jokes
[22:05.330 --> 22:10.310]  in your dreams and you woke up depressed because of it. I think I think what that was was
[22:10.310 --> 22:15.330]  I was watching a lot of like different live streams of just like weird people I found
[22:15.330 --> 22:20.970]  on TikTok and a lot of there's a lot of trying to be funny in those environments that just
[22:20.970 --> 22:25.290]  are really cringeworthy. So I think that's where the inception came from. Maybe I'm more
[22:25.290 --> 22:28.690]  affected by my dreams than the average person. It's a really interesting question. I don't
[22:28.690 --> 22:33.490]  even know how to measure that. I mean, you seem you seem to swing harder in both directions.
[22:33.850 --> 22:40.070]  So that's that's the only reason I ask. Yeah. But Gavin, you said a meatball sub, Andrew
[22:40.070 --> 22:46.170]  or anyone? Brisket. Going to Texas and experiencing brisket. Brisket is just not a thing that
[22:46.170 --> 22:51.230]  I had like readily available as a sandwich type meat or as a meat in general. Until recently,
[22:51.770 --> 22:56.530]  brisket was like a huge realization of like, holy shit, I'm really I'm missing out when
[22:56.530 --> 23:02.570]  it comes to these sandwiches. I've said that I'm pretty boring. How about you guys, Nick
[23:02.570 --> 23:11.270]  and Eric? Aunt Nellie's number eight deli club sub. Aunt Nellie's is a sandwich shop in El
[23:11.270 --> 23:17.650]  Cajon near where Mega 64 studio used to be. And it is a place that had almost no parking.
[23:18.210 --> 23:25.190]  And it was a headache to get to. And the sandwich was so fucking good. It was man, it is just
[23:25.190 --> 23:31.150]  like nothing but good memories about eating that specific sandwich. Parking across the
[23:31.150 --> 23:35.270]  street at another business and getting yelled at by a guy. He was like, you walk out with
[23:35.270 --> 23:40.190]  your sandwich and he's like, hey, don't ever park here again. Next time it's tow time.
[23:40.350 --> 23:44.570]  And then me and my friend Dominic laughing at him while we eat our sandwiches and drive
[23:44.570 --> 23:51.190]  away. And it was really recommend Aunt Nellie's in El Cajon, the deli club sub. It is it's
[23:51.190 --> 23:56.410]  turkey, ham, roast beef and Swiss. Can I say something potentially controversial? Absolutely.
[23:57.090 --> 24:04.150]  I don't like shredded food. Yeah, that's fine. You have a terrible palate. It's to be expected.
[24:04.210 --> 24:08.910]  I assume you're referring to shredded lettuce? Yeah. I don't really like grated cheese or
[24:08.910 --> 24:14.570]  shredded lettuce. I feel like it's really annoying. Is there a shredded food that you
[24:14.570 --> 24:21.170]  do like? Like shredded chicken, maybe? You gotta like shredded chicken. Is there any
[24:21.170 --> 24:25.450]  type of shredded chicken there? What does that mean? It's just different. Yeah. I mean,
[24:25.510 --> 24:29.870]  how are you going to have a full chicken enchilada? You just wrap a tortilla around a drumstick?
[24:30.010 --> 24:36.730]  You gotta shred it. You know what? You might be right. Do you ever enjoy a chicken sandwich,
[24:36.930 --> 24:40.910]  Gavin? Yeah. Well, when you eat a chicken sandwich, do you think, well, is this any
[24:40.910 --> 24:44.770]  better than roast chicken? Like, what are you saying? Well, it's usually just cut up
[24:44.770 --> 24:50.030]  chicken. Do you like, you like tuna fish. That's true. What don't you like about the
[24:50.030 --> 24:54.830]  shredded lettuce? What is it specifically? It's annoying and it falls out everywhere.
[24:56.550 --> 25:00.850]  There's just so many points of failure to that sandwich. I would just, I would rather have
[25:00.850 --> 25:05.470]  that than big pieces of lettuce. Really? What's wrong with just a nice slab of lettuce? There's
[25:05.470 --> 25:09.510]  nothing wrong with it. But if you're asking me my preference, it would be shredded lettuce. I
[25:09.510 --> 25:14.470]  will say the slab of lettuce can be a little overwhelming. You can get a large chunk of
[25:14.470 --> 25:18.730]  lettuce. The bite ratio can be off with it. I just, I just prefer. And I think it, I think
[25:18.730 --> 25:22.370]  when it gets tossed in like the oil and vinegar for a sandwich like that, for the Aunt Nellie's
[25:22.370 --> 25:29.410]  Deli Club sub, delicious. Oh, it's too wet. Oh, I forgot. You have like a thing. I forgot.
[25:29.650 --> 25:34.230]  Go into Jersey Mike's. Unless I ate the sandwich sort of six seconds after it was handed to me,
[25:34.270 --> 25:37.470]  that thing was just a wash. That's a wet sandwich. I forgot. We, I think we had a
[25:37.470 --> 25:42.510]  conversation that was similar the other day where you asked me what my favorite Christmas song was.
[25:42.510 --> 25:47.770]  And I said, uh, wonderful Christmas time. And you said, oh, you only sang that because I hate it. And
[25:47.770 --> 25:55.290]  I didn't know that you hated it. So, um, sometimes, uh, you know, my things don't revolve around, uh,
[25:55.290 --> 26:01.730]  what you like or don't. That's fine. Something to keep in mind. I'm just chiming in. Hey, Nick,
[26:01.770 --> 26:06.870]  what are you doing? What do you mean? What is that? What the fuck happened? Nick just posted
[26:06.870 --> 26:14.230]  what looks like a sub that has chicken nuggets and French fries and Thousand Island dressing
[26:14.230 --> 26:19.070]  and mayonnaise on it. I feel like this is the place that sent me down the path that led to
[26:19.070 --> 26:24.830]  what is the creature that is the sauce monkey from face jam. Uh, there's a, yeah, there's a
[26:24.830 --> 26:28.710]  place off 24th street. It doesn't exist anymore for some reason. Uh, it's called, it was called
[26:28.710 --> 26:33.990]  big bite, but they had this things called fat sandwiches, P-H-A-T. And they had all these
[26:33.990 --> 26:40.450]  different ingredients. This one in particular is chicken tenders. It's got some ham. There's, uh,
[26:40.450 --> 26:45.070]  there's also mozzarella sticks, fries, things like that. There are a lot of subs like those,
[26:45.150 --> 26:49.550]  but they had one that was like a cheeseburger. So it was like two, two burgers side-by-side like
[26:49.550 --> 26:53.730]  that. It had the ham and had the chicken tenders. It had the mozzarella sticks. It had onion rings
[26:53.730 --> 26:58.550]  and it had French fries and then like a bunch of sauces on top of it. And if you ate, like,
[26:58.970 --> 27:04.650]  I think if you ate four of them in like an hour or something, you could make your own and name it.
[27:04.650 --> 27:11.830]  And that was always the goal. And they, and I feel like eating that changed my life and probably
[27:11.830 --> 27:20.410]  put me on a pathway to heart disease, but it was delicious. And I remember it fondly.
[27:20.610 --> 27:22.750]  So is that picture your origin story?
[27:23.230 --> 27:26.030]  I think so. That was my vat of acid.
[27:26.030 --> 27:34.330]  Look at, look at these other fucking, somebody put waffle fries. This is also from, it looks like,
[27:35.570 --> 27:38.410]  this isn't, is this fucking real? What the fuck?
[27:38.630 --> 27:40.750]  It was. The time has passed.
[27:42.590 --> 27:47.990]  It's just a sandwich with waffle fries. It looks like in between the bread.
[27:48.370 --> 27:50.490]  Maybe there's some poutine or something in there too.
[27:50.530 --> 27:53.070]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. They put ranch on a lot of the stuff too.
[27:53.070 --> 27:57.030]  It's like their gimmick was you have to make a sandwich in the dark
[27:57.030 --> 28:02.550]  and you just don't know. And then you walk out and you just eat what you have.
[28:02.870 --> 28:05.470]  And the light in the fridge also doesn't work.
[28:05.570 --> 28:13.530]  It really is like, hey, are you 19? Do you want to just put something that you would eat outside of
[28:13.530 --> 28:20.790]  a sandwich bread inside of some sandwich bread and then we sell it to you? And that's Nick's
[28:20.790 --> 28:26.650]  origin story. If you eat three of them in a row, you get enlisted into the super soldier program.
[28:30.410 --> 28:31.390]  That's death.
[28:35.150 --> 28:36.310]  Jesus Christ.

[31:55.020 --> 31:59.200]  between Halloween and Christmas for me, Thanksgiving, well it's American Thanksgiving,
[31:59.380 --> 32:05.400]  but still. I celebrate it, I love it, but it's an especially busy time as well as a stressful time.
[32:06.040 --> 32:10.260]  It's just so many things going on. Plus, with seasonal depression, it can just be difficult.
[32:10.980 --> 32:14.980]  I mean, this time of year can be a lot, and it's natural to feel some sadness or anxiety about it.
[32:15.320 --> 32:19.180]  But adding something new and positive to your life can counteract some of those feelings.

[32:44.360 --> 32:50.700]  so many obstacles and trauma in my past that I really struggled with for a long time, and sometimes

[33:25.680 --> 33:30.460]  Oh my god, I was doing, uh, Nick, that's a scary fucking sandwich. And I gotta agree,
[33:30.520 --> 33:34.940]  it does look like it was assembled in the dark. Almost it's like a, like a top chef challenge
[33:34.940 --> 33:40.220]  where everybody has to blindfold themselves, and they have 45 seconds in a pantry in a fridge to
[33:40.220 --> 33:45.300]  put a sandwich together. Yeah, it's like they open the blind box and it's hoagies and waffle
[33:45.300 --> 33:51.920]  fries is the only thing you have. Oh man, uh, Gracie said it looks like a heart attack on bread,
[33:51.980 --> 33:56.320]  and I think that's probably the most accurate description. Uh, I was, I asked because,
[33:56.680 --> 33:59.900]  well, like I said, I was thinking about the pastrami in general and how much it affected
[33:59.900 --> 34:02.640]  my life. But so I was doing a little bit of sandwich research today, and I was trying to
[34:02.640 --> 34:08.880]  figure out what country eats the most sandwiches. And I was unable to determine, uh, Google failed
[34:08.880 --> 34:13.800]  me. But I did learn, Gavin, that your country, the UK, is in a bit of a sandwich renaissance
[34:13.800 --> 34:17.200]  right now. And sandwiches are kind of taking over the country. That's like an eight billion
[34:17.200 --> 34:22.360]  dollar a year industry or something. And like the breakfast is dominated by breakfast sandwiches
[34:22.360 --> 34:26.280]  now. And then lunch sandwiches have been a long established thing. And now I guess it's creeping
[34:26.280 --> 34:31.500]  into dinner is what I read. Dinner sandwiches. Wow. Yeah. I mean, breakfast sammies like a nice
[34:32.160 --> 34:37.280]  bacon butty or a, you know, some sort of BAP. That's, that's a killer way to start a morning.
[34:37.280 --> 34:44.640]  I looked at best sandwiches in the world by country, and the best sandwich in England
[34:44.640 --> 34:48.160]  was listed as a bacon baddie. And I was going to ask you what that is.
[34:48.420 --> 34:50.760]  Bacon butty? Butty. Bacon butty. Yeah. Sorry.
[34:52.380 --> 34:58.780]  Bacon baddie. But it's B-U-T-T-Y, right? Yeah. What does that mean?
[35:00.580 --> 35:05.460]  It was like that Gavin has been lying this entire time about being from
[35:05.460 --> 35:09.740]  overseas and it just caught him. I just caught him in the lie. Yeah,
[35:09.760 --> 35:13.960]  he just was not ready for that question at all. He's not researched this part of his lie.
[35:15.020 --> 35:19.780]  It was weird because he like laughed at you for asking the question and then couldn't answer it.
[35:24.460 --> 35:31.040]  It's a bacon sandwich, but that's it. I mean, it's like saying like what soup? Yeah, but
[35:32.880 --> 35:36.180]  it's a it's a broth with a variety of ingredients.
[35:40.840 --> 35:47.820]  I mean, a bacon butty could be a sandwich. It could be a sexual position. There's no telling.
[35:48.100 --> 35:54.360]  It's not just like he said, what soup? He said, what is French onion soup? And you're like, oh,
[35:54.360 --> 36:01.360]  soup? Yeah, I think typically that a butty could just be, you know, any sort of brekkie sandwich
[36:01.360 --> 36:07.400]  and a bap is usually a bun. And brekkie is short for breakfast. That's it, yeah. And
[36:07.400 --> 36:13.720]  batty is usually your ass. What? Batty is an ass, but butty is a sandwich.
[36:14.740 --> 36:18.340]  Yeah, that could be real confusing depending on your... Well, a bacon batty would be...
[36:20.060 --> 36:21.180]  That'd be someone else.
[36:32.180 --> 36:38.440]  Okay, well, that brings me to my next question. Should we invent an official f*** face sandwich?
[36:39.800 --> 36:45.280]  How have we not? Nick is on board. Yeah, how have we not? Like, maybe we each get to control
[36:45.280 --> 36:52.000]  one ingredient. I really don't like these games when Gavin's involved. Well, I mean,
[36:52.020 --> 36:55.140]  I think we would. I think we would all say we don't like these games when you're involved,
[36:55.140 --> 36:59.140]  but I'm willing to play it with you. What? What? Are you kidding?
[37:00.500 --> 37:04.840]  I am... We have verbs about how you handle food challenges.
[37:06.000 --> 37:10.260]  The pulp is, uh, was a masterpiece. And the salad cream was a verb.
[37:10.940 --> 37:15.660]  The, uh, yeah, that is. But that was Gavin's fault, the salad cream. What do you mean?
[37:15.960 --> 37:19.920]  What are we talking about? Salad cream would have never been in the equation if it weren't for you.
[37:20.080 --> 37:23.820]  I'm never bringing salad cream. I salad creamed it. So because I
[37:23.820 --> 37:30.320]  introduced you to the thing you half-assed. No, I think the problem was I, what, battied it?
[37:30.620 --> 37:37.540]  Is that the word? I full-assed it. I put too many things in. I was overly ambitious with my salad.
[37:38.800 --> 37:44.460]  That was the criticism. I had every ingredient in it. I don't think you could call that a half-ass.
[37:45.440 --> 37:48.980]  Uh, Nick says he has to rein me in. Oh, we have to rein me in.
[37:48.980 --> 37:57.380]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So are we all inputting one ingredient or are we all presenting a sandwich
[37:57.380 --> 38:03.180]  and one of them wins the crown as the f*** face sandwich? I think we should build it together.
[38:03.500 --> 38:06.820]  Like, we each get to, like, I would like, for instance, I have a strong opinion.
[38:07.480 --> 38:12.960]  I have a very strong opinion about the bread. Okay. I think it should be on an onion roll.
[38:14.180 --> 38:17.000]  I don't think I've had an onion roll. I think those are the best.
[38:17.440 --> 38:21.640]  You know what I'm talking about, Nick? Like, uh, like that kind of sandwich bread?
[38:21.800 --> 38:23.860]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is that onion on there?
[38:24.220 --> 38:28.260]  Yeah, it's like, uh, it's like, uh, it's like onion. Like, yeah, it's real. It's like
[38:28.780 --> 38:32.080]  crunchy but juicy little bits of cooked onion that are in the roll.
[38:32.660 --> 38:34.760]  Okay. It's like fried a little or something.
[38:34.920 --> 38:37.580]  Oh, that looks good. Yeah, they're real good. And then like,
[38:37.660 --> 38:41.300]  and then I, so I would be like, that'd be my contribution. I wouldn't even try to cram
[38:41.300 --> 38:45.600]  pastrami in it. I just like, I feel very strongly about, about the house that a sandwich lives in.
[38:45.600 --> 38:49.220]  And I think that that is the ultimate house for a sandwich. And then I would be like,
[38:49.320 --> 38:52.800]  okay, and now Andrew, I pass it on to you. What would you add to that?
[38:53.900 --> 38:56.680]  I'm going to throw some mozzarella on that sandwich.
[38:56.860 --> 39:00.180]  Okay. Okay. Like toast, like, like melty.
[39:00.860 --> 39:03.080]  I'm assuming. Yeah. Yeah. I assume we're going to toast it.
[39:03.500 --> 39:05.900]  Yeah, I think so. That would be the goal. Yeah.
[39:05.920 --> 39:08.780]  I'm going to put some mozzarella with the intent of toasting later.
[39:10.760 --> 39:13.140]  Gavin or actually Andrew, you pick who it goes to next.
[39:13.620 --> 39:17.600]  Uh, let's, uh, let Eric. Throw something on the sandwich.
[39:19.980 --> 39:20.820]  Shredded lettuce.
[39:32.680 --> 39:36.700]  That sounds like a good sandwich. Eric, please pass it to your next person.
[39:37.040 --> 39:39.080]  Oh, why don't we go ahead and go to, uh, let's go to Nick.
[39:39.720 --> 39:48.720]  All right. Oh, I feel like we need, uh, like a, uh, an oven roasted ham on there.
[39:49.440 --> 39:52.660]  Ooh. Okay. Okay. Oven roasted ham.
[39:53.040 --> 39:56.620]  Yeah. And then, uh, I'm going to pass to Gavin.
[39:57.940 --> 40:00.720]  Um, what about a bit of pesto?
[40:02.740 --> 40:04.620]  Oh, I like that.
[40:04.620 --> 40:10.780]  Okay. I had a turkey sandwich today with pesto, so I'm all for that.
[40:11.060 --> 40:13.920]  Yeah, that sounds good. Good pick, Gavin. I apologize.
[40:14.340 --> 40:16.920]  Oh, wow. I thought that was a real dud. I thought nothing happened.
[40:16.920 --> 40:17.940]  No, I like pesto.
[40:18.380 --> 40:22.020]  I gotta say, I would never... pesto is one of those things that I don't ever think to eat,
[40:22.100 --> 40:23.700]  so I would never think of it as an ingredient. Yeah.
[40:23.900 --> 40:26.240]  But I'm willing to get to know it. Yeah.
[40:26.660 --> 40:30.520]  So we have here an onion, like an onion roll, right? And then we have mozzarella,
[40:31.200 --> 40:35.420]  shredded lettuce, uh, oven roasted... what was it? Black forest ham? Is that what you said,
[40:35.460 --> 40:36.220]  or did I invent that? Yeah.
[40:36.620 --> 40:42.140]  Oven roasted black forest ham. And then, and then for our sauce, we have pesto. Fresh pesto.
[40:42.680 --> 40:44.680]  Well, we also need Gracie's input.
[40:44.840 --> 40:45.060]  Yeah, yeah.
[40:45.060 --> 40:48.080]  Oh, and then Gracie, Gracie, you add the final component.
[40:49.880 --> 40:51.740]  Oh, I'm gonna add a tomato.
[40:52.960 --> 40:58.500]  Oh, hell yeah. Oh my god. Oh, I didn't know it needed it until you said that.
[40:58.720 --> 40:59.700]  Oh, shit, dude.
[40:59.700 --> 41:01.620]  Winning cherry on top, that was.
[41:01.800 --> 41:07.220]  That was a brilliant addition, Gracie. So now we've added, I guess, fresh sliced tomato to it.
[41:08.180 --> 41:09.120]  And this is...
[41:09.120 --> 41:10.780]  Am I allowed to take something off the sandwich?
[41:11.480 --> 41:11.720]  What?
[41:12.280 --> 41:15.580]  Am I allowed, when I get the sandwich, can I, can I remove an item from the sandwich,
[41:15.700 --> 41:16.260]  if I want to remove an item?
[41:16.260 --> 41:17.360]  But Gracie said no!
[41:18.640 --> 41:19.700]  Especially not my onion.
[41:19.960 --> 41:22.120]  Can I take something off, and she just said no!
[41:29.240 --> 41:30.320]  Well, here's the deal.
[41:31.100 --> 41:35.220]  As it's composed with the six ingredients we just assembled,
[41:35.380 --> 41:40.020]  we have created what I will assume we will call the regulation sandwich.
[41:40.660 --> 41:42.980]  So to eat the regulation sandwich, you would have,
[41:43.060 --> 41:45.340]  I assume it's going to be lightly toasted too, because we inferred that.
[41:45.600 --> 41:48.500]  It's going to have to be those ingredients on that sandwich,
[41:48.580 --> 41:50.080]  no more, no less lightly toasted.
[41:50.280 --> 41:53.340]  If you want to take tomatoes off of that sandwich, Andrew,
[41:53.400 --> 41:54.680]  which is what I'm assuming you're getting at.
[41:54.800 --> 41:55.140]  Oh, yeah.
[41:55.220 --> 41:58.460]  You can do that, but that becomes an unregulated sandwich at that point.
[41:58.460 --> 42:04.240]  Oh, just depends if you want to eat something that's unregulated.
[42:04.740 --> 42:05.580]  Oh, man.
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.920]  First of all, this is giving me a lot of trauma about the regulation bagel.
[42:09.340 --> 42:13.080]  The only thing worse than having your own sandwich,
[42:13.220 --> 42:16.360]  or like that's the greatest, that's the peak you'll ever have in life,
[42:16.400 --> 42:17.160]  is having your own sandwich.
[42:17.300 --> 42:20.500]  But losing it is such a, it's a real collapse.
[42:20.820 --> 42:22.360]  It's a real difficult thing to swallow.
[42:22.800 --> 42:23.860]  It's a regulation sandwich.
[42:24.460 --> 42:25.180]  It is, yeah.
[42:27.160 --> 42:29.420]  Um, I guess I'll just learn to like tomato.
[42:29.700 --> 42:33.220]  I guess I typically prefer my tomato in a liquefied form.
[42:33.220 --> 42:35.020]  Well, I wonder if you liquefy it first.
[42:35.820 --> 42:38.060]  Well, I can't. I can't just turn it to ketchup.
[42:38.340 --> 42:39.740]  I'll be honest with you, Andrew.
[42:39.860 --> 42:42.380]  I'm not a big fan of pesto, but I'm willing to, I'm going to learn.
[42:42.700 --> 42:45.620]  So maybe, maybe you and I can both stretch a little bit and we'll both...
[42:45.620 --> 42:46.120]  We'll meet in the middle.
[42:46.420 --> 42:47.120]  Yeah, we'll meet in the middle.
[42:47.180 --> 42:49.920]  We'll both conquer some culinary fears and we'll get there.
[42:50.380 --> 42:54.680]  What if we, what if we all meet up and we go to Geoff's house?
[42:54.680 --> 42:55.200]  Okay.
[42:55.320 --> 42:58.300]  And we'll, we'll all make this sandwich in the dark.
[43:02.840 --> 43:04.340]  And see whose looks best.
[43:04.520 --> 43:06.880]  Oh, I feel like pesto in the dark is dangerous.
[43:07.280 --> 43:10.440]  Pesto in the dark is a, is a real slippery slope.
[43:12.440 --> 43:13.480]  Oh man.
[43:14.980 --> 43:16.220]  I'm all for it.
[43:16.680 --> 43:22.060]  I also highly encourage regulation listeners and comment leavers to make their own version,
[43:22.060 --> 43:26.240]  make their own identical version, make it exactly as described.
[43:26.680 --> 43:27.860]  You won't, you don't want it to be unregulated.
[43:27.960 --> 43:28.900]  You want a regulation sandwich.
[43:29.060 --> 43:32.660]  And then become comment leavers by sending us pictures so we can see what your sandwich looks
[43:32.660 --> 43:34.060]  like and then let us know how you like it.
[43:34.600 --> 43:39.700]  Maybe we can pick at some point the best picture of the regulation sandwich.
[43:40.020 --> 43:41.500]  I, I love that.
[43:41.680 --> 43:42.580]  I love that idea.
[43:42.880 --> 43:46.800]  I think, I think picking the best photo of it is really interesting because I think there's
[43:46.800 --> 43:52.320]  a lot of creative people who listen to the show who will send like professional grade
[43:52.320 --> 43:56.560]  photographs of a sandwich that we just made up for an episode.
[43:57.180 --> 44:01.720]  Yeah. And I think, I think the actual photography of the sandwich should, should be judged for
[44:01.720 --> 44:02.220]  points too.
[44:02.380 --> 44:04.220]  Like, it's not just about how the sandwich looks.
[44:04.240 --> 44:05.940]  It's like the whole composition.
[44:06.160 --> 44:07.240]  I want to see the composition.
[44:07.500 --> 44:08.480]  I want to see a setting.
[44:08.600 --> 44:09.620]  I want to see shadows.
[44:09.740 --> 44:10.320]  I want to see light.
[44:10.380 --> 44:11.800]  Like I'm with you a hundred percent.
[44:12.040 --> 44:14.960]  You want the, you want the sandwich photo to tell a story, right?
[44:15.180 --> 44:16.020]  A flavor story.
[44:16.380 --> 44:17.860]  Here's what, here's what I'll say about it too.
[44:18.060 --> 44:22.320]  The best one we get, I don't, we'll have to talk to Tony and them about this, but I say
[44:22.320 --> 44:26.560]  we go ahead and print it and put it on a shirt and then we give them a free copy of that
[44:26.560 --> 44:26.820]  shirt.
[44:27.080 --> 44:30.560]  And then we sell regulation sandwich t-shirts with the best fucking sandwich of all time
[44:30.560 --> 44:31.000]  on it.
[44:31.240 --> 44:33.600]  As, as designed by our audience.
[44:34.280 --> 44:37.580]  You want us to wear a picture of a sandwich that someone else made?
[44:37.880 --> 44:38.120]  Yeah.
[44:39.100 --> 44:39.860]  I love it.
[44:40.400 --> 44:40.860]  Yeah, I do.
[44:41.320 --> 44:44.560]  Just like I have a shirt that says pastrami, pastrami, pastrami for a different restaurant.
[44:45.520 --> 44:49.300]  Like why, why wouldn't you, why would we wear t-shirts of things that we're fans of?
[44:49.360 --> 44:50.300]  And I'm fans of sandwiches.
[44:50.860 --> 44:51.440]  I love it.
[44:51.840 --> 44:52.880]  I love a good sandwich.
[44:53.300 --> 44:53.640]  Yeah.
[44:54.760 --> 44:56.300]  Can I ask you guys something?
[44:56.920 --> 44:57.500]  Yeah, please do.
[44:58.200 --> 45:03.000]  I'd like to hear a story about, uh, you guys rented a fucking jackhammer and you dug a
[45:03.000 --> 45:04.380]  hole in Geoff's backyard?
[45:04.560 --> 45:05.040]  What happened?
[45:05.500 --> 45:06.840]  What, what, what went on with that?
[45:06.960 --> 45:08.680]  You guys got dirt, bean hole dirt.
[45:09.120 --> 45:10.780]  Well, there'll be a, there'll be a video for it.
[45:11.240 --> 45:12.160]  Oh, there's a video?
[45:12.580 --> 45:13.160]  Yeah, we filmed.
[45:13.680 --> 45:14.420]  Hell yeah.
[45:14.840 --> 45:15.820]  How did it go?
[45:16.360 --> 45:17.500]  We didn't need a jackhammer.
[45:18.580 --> 45:21.280]  Yeah, we didn't need it, but it was worth it.
[45:21.360 --> 45:22.080]  It was so much fun.
[45:22.080 --> 45:25.240]  Oh, I'm not saying it wasn't worth it or anything, but it was, we definitely didn't need it.
[45:25.660 --> 45:28.360]  Um, we should not be allowed to rent it.
[45:28.520 --> 45:30.520]  No one should be allowed to rent this kind of stuff.
[45:31.400 --> 45:37.720]  Uh, when I was with Gavin taking it back, I think we left the rental place and he just
[45:37.720 --> 45:42.400]  went, this shouldn't, people, I shouldn't be allowed to have any of this.
[45:42.400 --> 45:46.260]  Yeah. I mean, it was next to a giant stump grinder.
[45:46.440 --> 45:48.300]  Like why do they let people just have these things?
[45:49.220 --> 45:49.660]  Crazy.
[45:49.980 --> 45:54.580]  The amount of inadvertent triggerings of the jackhammer was unbelievable.
[45:55.620 --> 45:57.700]  Trying to reposition it or lift it up.
[45:57.760 --> 45:58.120]  And it'd be like...
[45:59.860 --> 46:03.000]  If that thing shot bullets, half my neighborhood would have been dead.
[46:04.520 --> 46:04.720]  Yeah.
[46:04.900 --> 46:06.500]  Every time you touched it, it went off.
[46:07.020 --> 46:07.740]  Oh my God.
[46:08.180 --> 46:11.460]  Did you guys encounter like any rocks like you did on the first bean hole dig?
[46:11.460 --> 46:14.660]  And it wasn't like useful or what was that like?
[46:15.940 --> 46:17.380]  We broke some rocks apart.
[46:18.200 --> 46:25.400]  Mostly it was Geoff getting it caught in a stump and then us having to try to pull it
[46:25.400 --> 46:28.180]  out of a stump for a really long time.
[46:28.320 --> 46:33.060]  Man, if you put the wrong bit on a, on a jackhammer and you go straight into a tree,
[46:33.180 --> 46:37.320]  like into a root or the dirt, it can be very hard to get it out of that dirt.
[46:37.440 --> 46:38.840]  It can really wedge itself in there.
[46:38.840 --> 46:43.640]  There was like maybe a, I don't know, five or six minutes there where Eric and I were
[46:43.640 --> 46:44.840]  a little nervous.
[46:45.340 --> 46:49.880]  Well, there was one point where Geoff had just started using it and he was getting used to it.
[46:50.180 --> 46:55.060]  And then he got the confidence just to look into the camera and smile while he was using it,
[46:55.060 --> 46:58.620]  but didn't realize that it was getting driven straight down.
[46:58.680 --> 46:59.400]  It just kept going.
[46:59.720 --> 47:03.620]  And by the time he stopped posing, it was like an entire foot in the ground.
[47:05.700 --> 47:11.020]  It was just, there was, we did, we got two different bits for this thing.
[47:11.140 --> 47:13.140]  One was for breaking rock.
[47:13.240 --> 47:17.020]  And the other one was for like cutting through clay and mud.
[47:17.400 --> 47:20.200]  Neither were needed for what we were doing.
[47:20.540 --> 47:25.820]  It was so soft, but, but we got to use the jackhammer and that was a lot of fun.
[47:25.820 --> 47:29.860]  And also, uh, it's so exhausting to use a jackhammer.
[47:29.860 --> 47:34.540]  My favorite part too, is that, uh, Geoff was so keen to get it going that he
[47:34.540 --> 47:40.080]  attempted to attach the little spade attachment to the underside of the cart that it arrived on.
[47:40.240 --> 47:44.060]  Instead of the actual jackhammer.
[47:44.620 --> 47:45.480]  I was just excited.
[47:45.940 --> 47:53.000]  So, it was so fucking heavy to get in and out of my 2008 Hyundai Accent.
[47:53.280 --> 47:58.280]  Like it, all of these, it's just day labor dudes renting stuff.
[47:58.720 --> 48:03.160]  And then me in my little beep beep hello, like my little little car.
[48:03.540 --> 48:05.520]  And it's like this, I don't, I don't belong here, man.
[48:05.640 --> 48:06.280]  It's crazy.
[48:06.540 --> 48:09.700]  Eric said when he went to rent it, the guy was like, man, you are lucky.
[48:09.840 --> 48:12.220]  This is the last jackhammer we have to rent in town.
[48:12.580 --> 48:16.420]  Which got us thinking, somewhere in Austin, which is the city under more,
[48:16.600 --> 48:19.340]  more fucking construction than anywhere else on earth right now.
[48:19.700 --> 48:22.600]  Somewhere in Austin, there's a crew standing around waiting because they couldn't,
[48:22.720 --> 48:24.840]  because there was one less jackhammer in the city.
[48:25.060 --> 48:28.180]  And real construction work isn't happening because of this.
[48:29.240 --> 48:33.000]  It's a thing where you have to like, when you're renting this from a place,
[48:33.100 --> 48:34.000]  you go like, I don't know.
[48:34.080 --> 48:37.840]  I go into a mode of like, yeah, man, do this all the time.
[48:38.240 --> 48:40.460]  Hell yeah, oh brother, hell yeah.
[48:40.600 --> 48:41.480]  That kind of thing.
[48:41.880 --> 48:44.300]  Oh, you got the, you got the Jack X 37?
[48:44.600 --> 48:45.280]  Nice, nice.
[48:45.400 --> 48:45.980]  I was looking at that.
[48:45.980 --> 48:48.040]  He's just like, oh yeah, you know how this part works and this thing?
[48:48.120 --> 48:48.900]  And I'm like, oh absolutely.
[48:49.020 --> 48:50.460]  He's like, oh yeah, you've done this before.
[48:50.760 --> 48:53.800]  And then I took it and then there's the fruits of our labor.
[48:54.240 --> 48:56.040]  A jackhammer stuck in a stump.
[48:56.040 --> 49:00.500]  Geoff, this is Geoff digging it out of the ground with the shovel.
[49:03.240 --> 49:06.520]  As long as we don't show that to the rental guy, I think I'm scot-free.
[49:11.140 --> 49:14.560]  It was so fucking stupid and unnecessary.
[49:15.240 --> 49:18.080]  It weighed as much as Eric's car.
[49:18.540 --> 49:19.300]  Oh my god.
[49:19.300 --> 49:20.300]  It's so fucking heavy.
[49:20.540 --> 49:21.220]  It was so heavy.
[49:21.220 --> 49:24.620]  Was it the type of thing that like you hurt from the next day?
[49:24.620 --> 49:26.640]  You woke up and you felt sore?
[49:26.800 --> 49:30.780]  I felt it in my upper back and my obliques.
[49:30.840 --> 49:36.940]  Because you're trying to hang on and you don't realize how much you're activating when you do it.
[49:37.800 --> 49:41.880]  It's different from lifting weights or running or anything.
[49:42.200 --> 49:47.420]  It's just your body's getting thrown around by something that is meant to be...
[49:48.360 --> 49:50.900]  I lied to the guy when I went and picked it up.
[49:51.320 --> 49:53.140]  He's like, what are you using this for?
[49:53.140 --> 49:54.420]  And I'm like, I don't know.
[49:54.680 --> 49:58.660]  My boss told me today we're getting through some dry clay.
[49:59.060 --> 50:03.180]  And we're getting through about a three and a half inch slab.
[50:03.300 --> 50:04.880]  And he's like, oh man, heavy stuff.
[50:04.920 --> 50:06.520]  And I'm like, yeah, but that's why we got this, right?
[50:06.560 --> 50:07.620]  And he's like, I hear that.
[50:07.780 --> 50:09.960]  And then we got stuck in a slammer.
[50:10.300 --> 50:15.540]  When we were turning together, Eric just went into a mode where he just kept saying phrases.
[50:16.020 --> 50:17.340]  But it wasn't really actually saying anything.
[50:17.680 --> 50:18.280]  He was just like...
[50:21.680 --> 50:24.160]  He was like, ah, yeah, cut through butter, man.
[50:24.260 --> 50:25.040]  Easy as pie.
[50:25.200 --> 50:30.320]  He's like, yeah, you know what, man?
[50:30.800 --> 50:32.920]  Yeah, hear that?
[50:33.020 --> 50:34.180]  I mean, Nick knows all of them.
[50:34.300 --> 50:34.700]  It's the same.
[50:34.820 --> 50:34.960]  Yeah.
[50:35.120 --> 50:35.460]  Yeah.
[50:35.500 --> 50:41.720]  You just gotta, you know, if you say enough stuff and you just talk in like a big circle,
[50:42.140 --> 50:46.100]  it's like you've done the job and now everyone buys that you belong there.
[50:46.240 --> 50:46.500]  It's all...
[50:46.500 --> 50:46.620]  Yeah.
[50:47.040 --> 50:47.680]  Nick is right.
[50:47.680 --> 50:49.000]  It's always working for the weekend.
[50:49.100 --> 50:52.020]  But then you start getting in a circle and you start going like, yeah, wake up every day,
[50:52.080 --> 50:53.240]  punch that time clock, you know?
[50:53.320 --> 50:54.980]  And they go, yeah, absolutely.
[50:55.720 --> 50:57.140]  And you're like, I'm just saying shit.
[50:59.420 --> 51:02.380]  It's like you've memorized a little like book of drivel that you can just...
[51:06.500 --> 51:09.440]  That just allows you to communicate with any type of person.
[51:09.860 --> 51:15.760]  I mean, that's what it was to work in a warehouse is just talking like that all the time.
[51:15.760 --> 51:16.540]  Mm-hmm.
[51:17.320 --> 51:18.240]  Oh, fuck.
[51:18.480 --> 51:19.400]  That's his own language.
[51:19.800 --> 51:21.220]  Yeah, it is a form of pleasantry.
[51:21.460 --> 51:21.620]  Absolutely.
[51:21.820 --> 51:23.120]  It totally is. Absolutely. Yeah.
[51:23.340 --> 51:27.700]  I can imagine you, Andrew, saying all those phrases as the guy was working on your foot.
[51:30.740 --> 51:37.160]  That's actually more realistically accurate than you realize from my warehouse days.
[51:38.800 --> 51:40.140]  I work in a warehouse.
[51:41.140 --> 51:41.940]  Rubbing your foot.
[51:42.940 --> 51:49.700]  Yeah, yeah, I worked in a warehouse for a while and I fucked my ankle up, shockingly,
[51:49.940 --> 51:55.200]  really bad for months because it's such a physically demanding job.
[51:55.340 --> 51:56.880]  It was never healing properly.
[51:57.040 --> 51:58.700]  So it just kept getting worse.
[51:59.400 --> 52:04.260]  And one of the people that worked there in sales was a retired hockey player.
[52:05.020 --> 52:06.600]  And it was so bad one day.
[52:06.700 --> 52:08.400]  He's like, have you wrapped it at all?
[52:08.460 --> 52:10.020]  And I was like, I have no idea how to do that.
[52:10.140 --> 52:10.740]  I don't know what that is.
[52:10.740 --> 52:15.180]  So before, like, they opened, he wrapped my ankle for me.
[52:15.600 --> 52:20.220]  Like, I took my shoe off and put it on, put my leg, my foot on his his leg.
[52:20.660 --> 52:21.560]  And he wrapped my ankle.
[52:21.620 --> 52:22.520]  So that that happened.
[52:24.160 --> 52:24.760]  You're joking.
[52:25.300 --> 52:26.140]  How old was this guy?
[52:27.260 --> 52:29.480]  Probably like mid 50s.
[52:29.900 --> 52:30.820]  Mid to late 50s.
[52:31.040 --> 52:33.160]  Did he have an orgasm while he was wrapping your foot or?
[52:33.520 --> 52:34.180]  I don't know.
[52:34.200 --> 52:35.480]  You think that happened later that night?
[52:35.820 --> 52:36.780]  I have no idea.
[52:37.420 --> 52:38.440]  That's not for me to judge.
[52:38.540 --> 52:39.060]  That's his business.
[52:39.060 --> 52:40.500]  Nick said, been there.
[52:45.400 --> 52:46.000]  But you do.
[52:46.060 --> 52:49.040]  There is an absolute cadence to like the way you talk with people.
[52:49.260 --> 52:50.620]  And it's its own language.
[52:50.880 --> 52:53.020]  So what kind of stuff were you saying while you were getting wrapped?
[52:55.360 --> 52:56.840]  I don't remember what I was.
[52:56.900 --> 52:59.580]  There's not a lot of I was talking about slab work.
[52:59.680 --> 53:00.680]  I can say that much.
[53:01.020 --> 53:02.000]  That tickles.
[53:02.220 --> 53:03.200]  Why are you using your mouth?
[53:03.460 --> 53:04.060]  This is weird.
[53:05.080 --> 53:07.540]  Yeah, I think it was more just internal embarrassment.
[53:09.260 --> 53:11.440]  That this guy was working on my foot.
[53:11.540 --> 53:13.920]  I understand you taking your pants off makes you more comfortable,
[53:13.940 --> 53:15.280]  but it's making me very uncomfortable.
[53:15.420 --> 53:16.260]  It's that kind of stuff.
[53:16.500 --> 53:18.200]  No, no.
[53:21.410 --> 53:23.830]  Was it weird when he wouldn't break eye contact?
[53:24.210 --> 53:25.830]  Like he should be looking at your ankle, right?
[53:25.830 --> 53:28.670]  No, I think he was more upset that I wouldn't break eye contact.
[53:28.950 --> 53:30.030]  I think it was weird for him.
[53:30.390 --> 53:30.770]  Was it?
[53:30.790 --> 53:31.590]  I just kept staring.
[53:32.090 --> 53:35.070]  Now, were you were you weirded out when he started to smell your foot?
[53:36.010 --> 53:39.230]  Uh, no, I requested that because I thought maybe he could tell
[53:39.230 --> 53:40.850]  if there was an infection or something.
[53:40.990 --> 53:42.330]  He seemed to know a lot about feet.
[53:42.350 --> 53:44.610]  Did he draw a face on it to give you a different eyeline?
[53:51.870 --> 53:53.890]  He confirmed that I have regulation toes.
[53:54.270 --> 53:56.330]  Spoken like a guy who's done that before, by the way.
[53:57.490 --> 53:57.870]  What?
[54:02.190 --> 54:04.110]  Aren't you the weird feet guy or something?
[54:04.630 --> 54:05.530]  Isn't that a thing?
[54:06.490 --> 54:07.350]  Oh, what was that again?
[54:07.710 --> 54:08.270]  I don't know.
[54:08.350 --> 54:08.950]  I don't remember.
[54:10.450 --> 54:12.030]  But anyway, yeah, no, that happened.
[54:12.870 --> 54:13.510]  Oh, man.
[54:13.710 --> 54:14.790]  Joys of working in a warehouse.
[54:15.670 --> 54:21.230]  Hey, on Monday, we we did a live stream where we Gavin came and sat on it, sat in on the break show,
[54:21.270 --> 54:22.690]  which was really wonderful to have you, by the way.
[54:22.730 --> 54:25.150]  It's so much fucking fun hanging out with you on the break show, Gav.
[54:25.410 --> 54:26.490]  I really like doing it.
[54:26.730 --> 54:28.290]  I would. I would love for you to do it more.
[54:28.390 --> 54:29.190]  I would. I really would.
[54:29.650 --> 54:30.430]  Anytime you want to.
[54:31.830 --> 54:36.390]  Anyway, so y'all you and Emily filled the dirt into the pins after Tony took it home
[54:36.390 --> 54:39.270]  and baked it in his oven to get rid of impurities and moisture.
[54:39.950 --> 54:44.450]  Yeah. And and then we also had the launch for the sale of the
[54:45.570 --> 54:50.710]  nacho helmet, right? The face nacho helmet, which is a very baseball centric thing.
[54:51.030 --> 54:54.930]  When you go to baseball games, you get a nacho helmet and then it has nachos or ice cream in it.
[54:54.930 --> 54:57.090]  And that's what you eat out of. It's like a little souvenir you get.
[54:58.110 --> 55:01.090]  And we discovered and you might find this interesting, Andrew.
[55:01.110 --> 55:06.950]  We discovered that the nacho helmet holds exactly a six pack of Diet Coke or in this case.
[55:06.950 --> 55:13.770]  I saw that. It made me wonder how many sodas a helmet that would fit my head could fill.
[55:14.890 --> 55:17.810]  That's interesting. That's I hadn't I hadn't.
[55:17.970 --> 55:22.890]  Could a gerbler because I have the soda helmet. It's great. Doesn't fit my head as expected.
[55:24.050 --> 55:28.310]  So I was curious, maybe like a full gerb. I think I could get easily like it.
[55:28.630 --> 55:32.350]  Is it too tight or is it literally just won't go over the skull?
[55:32.870 --> 55:35.650]  It goes over the skull and then it just doesn't fully.
[55:35.650 --> 55:40.470]  It doesn't fully. It's sort of like, you know, when I wore the the the balaclava.
[55:41.290 --> 55:45.130]  Sort of like that, where it had the tuft at the top. It's the same type of problem.
[55:46.030 --> 55:49.050]  Well, it got me thinking maybe we're marketing this thing incorrectly.
[55:49.290 --> 55:55.750]  What what we had there and what I've realized is what if we rebrand this as the party gerbler
[55:56.190 --> 56:00.370]  and you fill a six pack of beer or soda and then you take it to a party and give
[56:00.370 --> 56:02.890]  everybody a straw and everybody just drinks out of the party?
[56:02.890 --> 56:07.770]  Oh, the way when I was watching you guys do it, it looked like a shoe.
[56:07.830 --> 56:11.250]  But that you'd wear on your head. Yeah, like a head from it.
[56:11.570 --> 56:12.690]  Like a head shoe. Yeah.
[56:13.190 --> 56:13.890]  With issues.
[56:16.430 --> 56:29.580]  Grateful. So exactly like that.
[56:29.980 --> 56:33.080]  Anyway, so I just I think that we're selling this thing incorrectly.
[56:33.160 --> 56:35.680]  I think we should be marketing instead of as a natural helmet.
[56:35.760 --> 56:38.640]  We should be we should be marketing it as a party gerbler
[56:38.640 --> 56:41.880]  so that you can drink a six pack of soda or beer with your friends.
[56:42.280 --> 56:45.820]  That's it. I think it's a fun thing to chug out of for sure.
[56:46.160 --> 56:48.340]  Yeah. And you can chug from any direction, by the way.
[56:48.420 --> 56:50.420]  I did. I proved it on the live stream.
[56:50.480 --> 56:52.720]  You can do from the bill. You can do from the back or either side.
[56:53.780 --> 56:56.960]  Oh, that's good. I mean, I think really you need to think of it as
[56:56.960 --> 56:59.680]  it's whatever you want it to be. It's just helmet shaped.
[57:00.140 --> 57:02.420]  I'm sure you can build sandcastles out of that helmet.
[57:03.080 --> 57:06.000]  Do you have any headwear that fits you? No.
[57:08.420 --> 57:10.160]  Absolutely not. I wish I did.
[57:12.220 --> 57:15.340]  It sounded like we're going to get a beanie, but then it went the wrong way.
[57:15.880 --> 57:20.120]  What about one of those? Well, yeah, that one's not going to help you at all.
[57:20.260 --> 57:21.940]  Gavin, have you seen the new picture of the beanie?
[57:22.820 --> 57:24.520]  The one that was posted on the? Yeah.
[57:24.640 --> 57:25.980]  Yeah. In it. Yeah. Okay.
[57:26.100 --> 57:29.680]  Did we ever talk? That wasn't even on the podcast, the whole in it and it thing, though.
[57:29.760 --> 57:32.000]  It was. It was a lot of last episode. Yeah.
[57:32.020 --> 57:33.520]  Yeah. But we did we explain where it came from?
[57:34.700 --> 57:37.240]  I don't know. I thought we did, but...
[57:37.240 --> 57:37.900]  But please do.
[57:37.900 --> 57:38.700]  You're making me feel like we didn't.
[57:41.660 --> 57:43.640]  Uh, yeah, this would be the part where you explain it.
[57:43.640 --> 57:46.000]  Jesus Christ! Dude, what is going on? Are you okay?
[57:46.180 --> 57:49.040]  Are the cats breathing directly in your mouth? What's happening?
[57:51.300 --> 57:53.100]  I can't remember. You're like...
[57:53.700 --> 57:56.200]  What do you mean you can't remember? You're the one that...
[57:56.200 --> 57:59.340]  You're teeing yourself up and then just like...
[57:59.340 --> 58:01.380]  No, I wasn't teeing me up. I was just teeing up a group.
[58:02.700 --> 58:04.640]  I'm going to open my window now. Open your window, please.
[58:05.860 --> 58:09.320]  I thought... You just live in cat breath.
[58:09.640 --> 58:10.400]  What the fuck?
[58:12.900 --> 58:15.460]  That'd be a great name for a book about Gavin's life.
[58:15.980 --> 58:17.840]  Goddamn. Living in cat breath.
[58:18.200 --> 58:21.760]  Do you guys do you guys remember when Joaquin Phoenix went through that?
[58:21.840 --> 58:23.540]  This is me phase where... Yes.
[58:23.740 --> 58:26.020]  He was like out of intentionally like... Yes.
[58:26.240 --> 58:27.860]  Playing this aloof character who was out of touch.
[58:28.240 --> 58:29.860]  And he went on the David Letterman... Like on chat shows and things?
[58:30.180 --> 58:33.160]  Yeah, he went on the David Letterman show and it was a fucking train wreck and he wouldn't
[58:33.160 --> 58:36.440]  answer any questions and he was just being like incredibly difficult.
[58:36.940 --> 58:40.800]  And at the end, David Letterman made the funniest fucking joke in the world.
[58:40.920 --> 58:42.520]  He said, well, I'm sorry you couldn't be here tonight.
[58:43.120 --> 58:45.340]  That's how I feel about Gavin in this episode.
[58:45.460 --> 58:48.840]  I'm sorry you couldn't be here to enjoy this with us because we were having a lot of fun today.
[58:49.240 --> 58:50.980]  Oh, I'm also having fun. Okay.
[58:51.120 --> 58:55.800]  Yeah. I'd say the difference between Gavin and Joaquin Phoenix is what Gavin is doing is enjoyable.
[58:56.240 --> 58:57.780]  I'm actively enjoying it.
[58:59.020 --> 59:00.380]  I'm more worried about his enjoyment.
[59:01.280 --> 59:04.280]  Yeah, yeah. Maybe it's the damage of the tree hitting you in the head.
[59:04.380 --> 59:05.460]  Maybe it's starting to appear.
[59:05.720 --> 59:06.660]  Maybe it... have we...
[59:06.660 --> 59:08.180]  It was like a 10 year delay.
[59:08.540 --> 59:11.640]  Yeah, like a concussion, maybe. Some impact.
[59:12.160 --> 59:14.980]  Do you film anything particularly dangerous in slo-mo guys recently?
[59:15.080 --> 59:16.720]  Did you take out like a bowling ball to the...
[59:16.720 --> 59:17.520]  He shot a cannon.
[59:18.220 --> 59:18.540]  Oh.
[59:18.840 --> 59:19.140]  He fired a cannon.
[59:19.960 --> 59:21.780]  We shot a bowling ball at a skull.
[59:22.720 --> 59:23.520]  But yours...
[59:23.520 --> 59:24.240]  Was it your skull?
[59:24.880 --> 59:25.100]  No.
[59:25.140 --> 59:25.960]  Was it your skull?
[59:26.440 --> 59:28.300]  Fake one. I don't think it was mine.
[59:29.860 --> 59:32.580]  But based on what happened to the fake one, I would definitely have noticed.
[59:39.030 --> 59:44.270]  All I know is that it wasn't based on my nose. Because I'm assuming it shattered.
[59:46.430 --> 59:49.610]  I like the idea of just getting a cast of your head and the
[59:49.610 --> 59:51.530]  bowling ball just explodes on your nose.
[59:51.590 --> 59:52.830]  It just bounces off the nose.
[59:54.150 --> 59:55.250]  Oh my god.
[59:55.590 --> 01:00:00.650]  You know, like in a movie when like, and they cut the bullet with like a katana or whatever
[01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:04.910]  that's what the bowling ball would do. It would just like slice around the nose.
[01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:08.270]  I want to make you a hat that fits.
[01:00:08.830 --> 01:00:10.670]  I would love for you to make me a hat that fits.
[01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:12.130]  Can you measure your head size?
[01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:13.610]  I did. I did.
[01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:14.550]  Oh, what was the size?
[01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:18.310]  It's uh 26 inches. The circumference.
[01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:23.330]  All right, let me measure my head. I need to figure out how big that is compared to mine.
[01:00:23.530 --> 01:00:23.890]  26.
[01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:26.470]  I think the average is like 24.
[01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:29.010]  Average head...
[01:00:29.010 --> 01:00:30.470]  Oh yeah, you're like eight and a quarter.
[01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:32.650]  That's a big ass head dude.
[01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:35.230]  That's huge. Like lids. I don't think lids carries that dude.
[01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:35.790]  They don't.
[01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:36.810]  Eight and a quarter?
[01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:40.570]  I think my head is smaller measuring around my headphones.
[01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:45.090]  Your thoughts must be so much bigger.
[01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:50.170]  Yeah, but they're unfortunately they're not heavy as we established recently.
[01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:51.450]  There's some light...
[01:00:54.930 --> 01:00:56.730]  We gotta wrap this one up.
[01:00:57.370 --> 01:00:58.710]  Gavin's infecting Andrew.
[01:00:59.130 --> 01:01:00.510]  Yeah, I'm breaking down.
[01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:05.650]  Hey, well on the bright side, I didn't intend to do it necessarily,
[01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:08.870]  but we invented a regulation sandwich today that I'm pretty excited to try
[01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:13.590]  and maybe have a piece of blindfolded supplemental content to come out of it as well.
[01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:17.110]  Blindfolded? You don't want to do it in the dark?
[01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:20.010]  Well, yeah, I guess we could do it.
[01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:22.390]  It's the same. It doesn't matter.
[01:01:23.370 --> 01:01:26.150]  If we do it blindfolded, we can film it at a normal hour,
[01:01:26.410 --> 01:01:27.790]  like two in the afternoon while we're all at work.
[01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:28.170]  That's true.
[01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:31.150]  Do it at night, you guys all got to come over midnight or something.
[01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:37.310]  I just thought it'd be fun to use like thermal cameras and stuff to see what everyone's doing.
[01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:39.050]  All right, well, that does sound pretty fun.
[01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:41.290]  That, yeah, you've persuaded me.
[01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:42.490]  Do you have thermal cameras?
[01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:44.170]  Uh, yeah.
[01:01:44.490 --> 01:01:46.950]  Okay, well, then we'll do that then. That sounds great.
[01:01:46.990 --> 01:01:50.570]  Will the sandwich show up? I guess if we toast it, but that's at the end.
[01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:52.670]  I don't know. Much to think about.
[01:01:53.130 --> 01:01:55.490]  Yeah, we'll be able to see it after it's toasted. That's a great point.
[01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:58.270]  And all the cold ingredients will be really dark looking.
[01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:05.750]  I like, you know, in Predator when he covers himself in mud so that the Predator can't
[01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:11.170]  see him through the heat vision. Doing the same with the sandwich, but with the spread.
[01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:13.870]  The, uh, what was the spread on it again?
[01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:14.830]  Pesto.
[01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.530]  Pesto.
[01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:19.390]  Yeah, just coating it in pesto so you can't see it on the heat vision cam.
[01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:23.170]  Pesto would be great to smear on yourself because it also would provide a natural camo.
[01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:26.290]  Yeah, it's sort of a green, it's sort of mossy.
[01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:28.070]  Yeah, that'd work.
[01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:30.930]  Can we paint one of us with pesto?
[01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:33.010]  Like that dude in the Hunger Games.
[01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:34.610]  Yeah!
[01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:37.670]  Why don't we do a quick round of Not It to see who's doing it?
[01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:38.090]  Not It!
[01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:38.370]  Not It!
[01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.930]  Not It!
[01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:39.530]  Not It, Will, no!
[01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:39.690]  Nick.
[01:02:39.830 --> 01:02:40.230]  Get real!
[01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:41.430]  Nick.
[01:02:42.850 --> 01:02:44.210]  His name was Peta. Peta?
[01:02:44.530 --> 01:02:44.890]  Peta?
[01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:45.170]  Peta?
[01:02:45.290 --> 01:02:45.530]  Peta!
[01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:46.510]  Pesta?
[01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:47.930]  Pesto? Pesta?
[01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:51.150]  It's the dude from- is that the dude from Five Nights at Freddy's?
[01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:51.810]  Yeah.
[01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:52.590]  Yeah.
[01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:53.350]  Yeah, that's what I thought.
[01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:58.890]  Well, should we end this so that Gavin can go stand outside for a few minutes?
[01:02:59.690 --> 01:03:00.630]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:01.570]  Was I that bad?
[01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:02.930]  No, you're great.
[01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:03.530]  No, you're great.
[01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:04.110]  You're wonderful.
[01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:06.010]  Don't listen, don't listen to him.
[01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:09.570]  But seriously, in between recordings when we all get out to get a drink or whatever,
[01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:10.910]  maybe go stand outside for a few minutes.
[01:03:11.090 --> 01:03:11.430]  Okay.
[01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:12.230]  Get some fresh air.
[01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:16.250]  We're gonna- I have an update on your email that you wrote me, Geoff, for the chair thing.
[01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:17.590]  That'll be next episode.
[01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:19.070]  Get excited about that.
[01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:21.230]  Okay, well, I'm very excited now.
[01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:23.170]  Let's end this so we can get to that.

[01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:50.270]  Andrew's new studio.
[01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:51.910]  What are pubic glasses?
[01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:54.790]  Is the hot dog run genius or laziness?
[01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:56.650]  Butthole morning, beard afternoon.
[01:03:57.130 --> 01:03:58.290]  What is your entrance music?
[01:03:58.750 --> 01:04:00.930]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:03.970]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
