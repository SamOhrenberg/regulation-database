[00:10.030 --> 00:11.330]  How's that asshole feeling?
[00:12.390 --> 00:18.750]  My asshole feels fine. I had some really... I was telling Eric earlier. I had some pretty heinous farts yesterday, but my asshole's fine.
[00:20.650 --> 00:22.430]  What did you think was wrong my asshole?
[00:23.510 --> 00:28.990]  Spicy food and stuff? Lack of waxing is mainly my issue. Oh
[00:28.990 --> 00:36.130]  Well, yeah, my asshole feels hairy. I wish it was waxed, but unfortunately we can't seem to get that done
[00:36.130 --> 00:38.290]  Which I think is my fault. Yeah, I'm
[00:40.710 --> 00:42.550]  Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[00:42.690 --> 00:45.270]  I mean, I just I just took the blame for it
[00:45.790 --> 00:49.570]  Yeah, not in the order of operations. It should have gone
[00:50.310 --> 00:56.310]  What does that mean? Took the blame is maybe strong. You said it might be. No fucking kidding
[00:56.830 --> 01:01.170]  What what is that? I just said I think it's my fault that we're not getting our asshole waxed. Yeah, right
[01:01.170 --> 01:06.110]  That's the second part of what you said after leveling it
[01:06.830 --> 01:08.290]  Clearly not on yourself
[01:09.470 --> 01:11.410]  What does that mean? Oh my god
[01:11.910 --> 01:12.710]  just now
[01:13.790 --> 01:16.690]  Just now I said hello, and then I said my asshole was dirty
[01:16.690 --> 01:21.970]  You're rewinding too far. At first you wouldn't go far enough and then you went too far. That's ridiculous
[01:21.970 --> 01:24.130]  What was the first part I said? Ridiculous.
[01:24.710 --> 01:27.110]  Ridiculous. Oh for some reason we can't get that done
[01:28.370 --> 01:32.390]  Yeah, I agree and then big beat big beat big beat
[01:33.090 --> 01:34.870]  Oh, I think that's actually my fault
[01:35.290 --> 01:38.010]  Yeah, yeah, I mean that's how it works I was like
[01:38.010 --> 01:41.530]  Oh, yeah, we can't get that done for some reason and then I thought why can't we get it done?
[01:41.630 --> 01:43.930]  Then I realized I was the problem and then I took ownership of it
[01:43.930 --> 01:49.470]  I really don't see what I mean, there's some odd criticism for a guy who just took the bullet
[01:49.470 --> 01:53.750]  Uh willingly. No, no, you didn't you did not take the bullet. You shot the gun
[01:54.250 --> 01:56.990]  Took a ride around the block and then jumped in front
[01:56.990 --> 02:02.370]  You put your hand up and said I might take the bullet. You didn't you didn't take the bullet you offered
[02:02.970 --> 02:05.930]  I for bullet. Hold on. Hold on a second. Hold on a second
[02:09.210 --> 02:13.930]  Hey, what's up everybody? Hey, hey jeff not much just hanging out. Uh
[02:13.930 --> 02:19.490]  Hey, did I mention recently for no reason out of the blue that if we don't get waxed this week, it's my fault
[02:19.490 --> 02:20.890]  Just want everybody here to know
[02:20.890 --> 02:23.350]  Oh, that's good. We got that on tape, right? That's good
[02:23.350 --> 02:27.690]  That's a big stupid deal for some dumb fucking reason that you guys are all upset about
[02:28.190 --> 02:30.690]  No, nobody's upset. Yeah, I don't think anybody's mad
[02:32.590 --> 02:38.030]  Now I got fucking assaulted when I walked into this one. Hey, fuck you. What are you talking about?
[02:38.910 --> 02:42.810]  No, no, no, remember. Hang on. No, what did I do? Remember you said hello
[02:43.330 --> 02:44.050]  yeah, then
[02:44.910 --> 02:46.050]  Here we are. I said hello
[02:46.570 --> 02:47.270]  and then
[02:47.910 --> 02:51.790]  Asked about your asshole, then you got really mad for some reason. Gavin's late
[02:51.790 --> 02:57.650]  Oh my god. Do you think Gavin knows we're doing this? I doubt it
[02:57.650 --> 03:03.270]  Geoff that delivery was like such a grizzled action star when you just did that. Oh my god
[03:03.270 --> 03:04.330]  That was great
[03:06.610 --> 03:08.510]  I'm gonna kill all these aliens
[03:10.290 --> 03:11.590]  And if they're named Andrew
[03:11.590 --> 03:12.270]  Oh
[03:13.710 --> 03:15.030]  I mean, we know that
[03:15.510 --> 03:18.790]  It's not a question of will you yeah choke them out
[03:19.270 --> 03:20.870]  Fucking drown me in pickle juice
[03:20.870 --> 03:24.810]  I thought when somebody was gonna try to do a pickle juice chug when I saw the pickle juice
[03:24.810 --> 03:29.010]  Oh, I could I Andrew if it was something else, I think I could probably do the pickle juice
[03:29.610 --> 03:33.070]  The oh the pickle juice. I can't I oh, it's just so brutal
[03:33.270 --> 03:34.050]  It's not for me
[03:35.030 --> 03:41.930]  It seems like a thing that people either hate or love. There's no no one's different on pickle juice. Love it
[03:41.930 --> 03:46.230]  I hate it. How do you feel love it? How do you I hate it? Yeah, i'm not a fan
[03:46.970 --> 03:52.950]  Yeah, love it. Do you want me to text Gavin or does somebody else want to text Gavin? Should I text the group?
[03:53.230 --> 03:54.430]  I mean, you're the producer
[03:57.780 --> 04:00.940]  I will I thought we were gonna get a sharp Gavin today
[04:01.920 --> 04:04.120]  Yeah, I texted him. I said, how was your sleep?
[04:04.980 --> 04:09.800]  He said good. I don't understand why when I got into the chat everybody was already spicy
[04:09.800 --> 04:13.940]  Like what what did I miss in the pleasantries? No, I I think I had the I had the nice
[04:13.940 --> 04:19.300]  I had a lovely morning with eric. We we already did a podcast together. It was great. Yeah, it's fantastic
[04:19.300 --> 04:20.340]  It's totally fine
[04:20.340 --> 04:25.340]  Then you have to think about so if the factor was me and you and that was super positive you have to think about what?
[04:25.480 --> 04:27.600]  Other things what other elements got added here. Is it Gracie?
[04:28.520 --> 04:28.880]  Oh
[04:29.700 --> 04:33.620]  Uh, Gracie's been pretty quiet. So I don't think it's Gracie. I wasn't quiet before you got here
[04:34.780 --> 04:36.740]  Oh, oh see there you go
[04:41.440 --> 04:42.680]  Gavin didn't accept
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.640]  Gavin didn't what yeah, but Gavin didn't accept the invite is on par with his tenure here at the company
[04:50.180 --> 04:54.440]  Yeah, but we I remember I remember Gavin saying, uh, yeah
[04:54.980 --> 04:59.980]  Yeah, right. Oh, that was really good. Gavin. That was that was I mean, that was really good
[04:59.980 --> 05:03.600]  Well, i've i've heard that no yes about 3 000 times
[05:04.200 --> 05:08.280]  In my career with Gavin, so yeah, you think this is the episode that we're doing right now?
[05:09.220 --> 05:12.340]  I don't know. It depends. It depends on if Gavin shows up or not
[05:12.340 --> 05:18.000]  If he doesn't show up then no, this is nothing but okay, but what if he does show up? No, it's something
[05:18.540 --> 05:22.560]  We've gone too far for it to be nothing. This is it's only been three minutes
[05:22.560 --> 05:27.580]  So is andrew mad that we haven't waxed our assholes yet? And he's waxed his pubes. Is that what's good?
[05:27.580 --> 05:29.300]  Is that what i'm is that what i'm walking into?
[05:29.520 --> 05:33.380]  I wanted to just see where we're at with it. I think the audience is really excited for the bit
[05:33.380 --> 05:38.300]  We were gonna do it tuesday afternoon, but I can't make it tuesday afternoon because I have wedding stuff. Yep
[05:38.920 --> 05:39.320]  Yeah
[05:40.220 --> 05:45.340]  Everything just got it like we just have to move. There's like a lot this week that we won't be able to
[05:45.900 --> 05:50.840]  Get to because of that. So again, that's why we're recording on like a monday. But uh, yeah we have
[05:50.840 --> 05:54.520]  There he is the latest boy we've ever seen
[05:54.520 --> 05:57.140]  It's harder to be on time to the changed
[05:57.720 --> 06:03.740]  The changed days. Well, it's the same time though. I like I agree. It's a different day, but it is the same time
[06:03.740 --> 06:05.980]  Yeah, just my alarm was on the other day
[06:06.840 --> 06:07.320]  Oh
[06:08.020 --> 06:11.900]  But I did text you earlier about it. I did check your sleep
[06:11.900 --> 06:15.520]  I did say we'd get a lightning fast gavin and that is
[06:16.040 --> 06:22.260]  Not the case if it makes you feel any better. I was uh at this exact desk just not in here
[06:22.260 --> 06:27.500]  It doesn't why were you at the were you were you editing slow-mo guys or something I was
[06:28.480 --> 06:31.760]  Yeah, how are you? How are you doing? Gavin? You slept? Well, you feeling okay?
[06:32.260 --> 06:36.920]  Yeah, I feel I feel like I need to apologize for my last two episodes. No
[06:37.480 --> 06:38.960]  No, no, not at all
[06:38.960 --> 06:44.340]  Maybe for the moment in between the two episodes when you yelled at us when you found out we were doing two even though you already
[06:44.340 --> 06:45.520]  Knew no, no
[06:45.520 --> 06:50.020]  I yelled at you after the second one when you said that we didn't have to have done two because we're doing this one right now
[06:50.020 --> 06:58.260]  You uh, you could potentially apologize for leaving delicious mcdonald's outside of your door for an entire evening if you want to apologize for things
[06:58.880 --> 07:04.440]  Did you leave your mcdonald's outside your door for an entire evening? Well, I didn't know you'd sent it
[07:05.040 --> 07:12.480]  Even after I thanked him for sending the mcdonald's in our group chat like I just I just didn't know what you were talking about
[07:14.600 --> 07:17.200]  God for god forbid you you ask
[07:19.220 --> 07:21.000]  Yeah, you just didn't reply at all
[07:21.860 --> 07:27.920]  I assumed you had 10 000 cameras on every angle of your home. So I just figured you would see
[07:28.480 --> 07:30.020]  Via like a ring or something
[07:30.020 --> 07:36.420]  That somebody dropped something off if you get within a hundred yards of his house with a cucumber seven alarms go off
[07:36.420 --> 07:42.700]  Apparently a mcdonald's employee can walk right up and tuck it right in. I think it was hidden behind the giant stack of bubbly
[07:43.120 --> 07:43.520]  All right
[07:44.420 --> 07:48.180]  Nick, I would have sent you cheeseburgers too for mcdonald's, but I didn't I don't know your address
[07:48.180 --> 07:50.600]  Which is probably smart, but I don't I don't know where you live
[07:50.600 --> 07:51.800]  So I can't can't do that
[07:51.800 --> 07:54.040]  But I I did send them to gavin or jeff
[07:54.040 --> 08:00.000]  I know your address nick and I would have given it to him had he asked what what you've just leveled to nick is such a
[08:00.900 --> 08:07.380]  Like double-sided sword like you are saying I will send you free cheeseburgers and he wants that so desperately
[08:07.380 --> 08:08.680]  but no
[08:08.680 --> 08:09.760]  but the
[08:10.260 --> 08:12.800]  But the what negative may come to you
[08:12.800 --> 08:16.840]  Yes is very he has to be nervous about it. I would well
[08:16.840 --> 08:22.220]  that's that's why i've never asked for your address eric or nick's address because I understand that there is a
[08:22.220 --> 08:25.280]  History that extends it's not a simple question. So
[08:25.920 --> 08:27.960]  Yeah, it's you get it you get a happy meal
[08:27.960 --> 08:32.120]  But the instead of a regular happy meal the burger is in a giant pink porta potty
[08:33.260 --> 08:35.380]  No, that's hard to dispose of
[08:36.200 --> 08:43.060]  I like to eric's use of the famous saying a double-sided sword a double sides. I couldn't I couldn't think of the phrase
[08:43.060 --> 08:45.480]  I was like man i'm grasping at straws here
[08:46.500 --> 08:48.780]  It was i'm like falling apart, you know
[08:48.780 --> 08:52.220]  What happens is that we change it to a different day and that can be hard on people
[08:52.220 --> 08:58.180]  So yeah a different day throws everything off. That's a real both sides of the same coin phrase there
[08:58.180 --> 09:00.960]  He's grasping at double-edged straws
[09:00.960 --> 09:01.520]  Yep
[09:01.520 --> 09:04.000]  It's a real elissa in the pool
[09:04.560 --> 09:04.820]  Yeah
[09:06.740 --> 09:12.360]  Forgot about that. Oh besides the same coin right calling smeesh me. It's perfect
[09:12.880 --> 09:16.660]  This is what this is episode 183, by the way. Thank you real zazzle of an episode
[09:17.200 --> 09:18.860]  Well so far it's been an interesting one
[09:19.320 --> 09:24.800]  Uh, i'm not sure when it started. I gotta say gav. Uh, I walked into it and they were fighting they were feisty
[09:25.440 --> 09:26.940]  That we haven't waxed our assholes yet
[09:27.540 --> 09:30.940]  They were feisty towards eric because we haven't waxed our assholes yet
[09:30.940 --> 09:31.500]  They were
[09:32.040 --> 09:37.440]  Eric was feisty towards me for some reason because I didn't I didn't I didn't accept blame hard enough
[09:37.440 --> 09:44.420]  I think we all accepted the fact that the pool was dropped by eric two weeks ago. Whoa, the ball was dropped by eric
[09:45.660 --> 09:51.100]  Listen, I don't want we went through this. Yeah, I did. I didn't mean to pull the pin on this. I just yeah, you did
[09:51.100 --> 09:55.080]  No, no, no, I really didn't. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you didn't. I was trying to turn it
[09:55.080 --> 09:58.740]  I was just letting gavin know you did exactly what you meant to do
[09:58.740 --> 10:02.980]  This is no, this is what you know, this is what you meant to do. This is exactly what it was
[10:02.980 --> 10:09.280]  It's exactly what we all knew exactly what it was about how eric's overextended right now
[10:09.280 --> 10:12.280]  And he's maybe got too much on his little no. No, no, no
[10:12.280 --> 10:16.160]  No, no, because we had we had a day and a time locked in for this week
[10:16.160 --> 10:21.420]  Unfortunately, we're unable to do it and uh, there's uh people who are unavailable
[10:22.080 --> 10:26.980]  uh in the coming days and perhaps week so, uh
[10:27.480 --> 10:29.700]  Yeah, jeff knows what he did it's fine it's okay
[10:30.880 --> 10:31.820]  It's fine. It's fine
[10:31.820 --> 10:39.680]  Anyway, episode 183 of the face podcast. Wow guys. Did you believe what we've done so far?
[10:40.240 --> 10:45.120]  Season two dash two. Uh, anyway gav. I just wanted to let you know if you notice anything, uh
[10:45.120 --> 10:50.840]  Being a little off people are a little prickly today for some reason and I just wanted to since you got in a little late
[10:50.840 --> 10:54.380]  Uh, I wanted to make sure you were aware of that just like our gooches will be in like a month
[10:54.380 --> 10:54.920]  a
[10:56.820 --> 10:59.040]  Month that's optimistic. Oh, man
[10:59.620 --> 10:59.940]  uh
[11:00.480 --> 11:04.860]  Dude, i'm so ready to get my asshole waxed. I I don't even I can't even tell you
[11:04.860 --> 11:09.480]  No, you're not. I can't even tell you i'm so ready. I'm so ready. Do it to me right now. Do it to me right now
[11:10.760 --> 11:12.100]  Wax my asshole right now
[11:12.820 --> 11:17.700]  I just don't even know what to say to that. Yeah, I don't know. I don't it's really yeah, I mean really
[11:18.500 --> 11:21.660]  I guess I mean I would say it's a bluff, but I just don't even know what to do
[11:21.660 --> 11:26.060]  There's something fearful about a man yelling wax my ass right now to himself
[11:27.620 --> 11:29.160]  I'm just i'm intimidated
[11:30.020 --> 11:34.520]  Oh, hold on. Let me pull up my notes for today. Uh, okay. Here's my notes for today. Okay
[11:35.400 --> 11:39.780]  That was it. I don't have any what do you guys I have a note. I have a question for you, Geoff
[11:40.200 --> 11:42.060]  Okay, I think i've been thinking about this
[11:42.060 --> 11:48.100]  We were yeah filming something and it was immortality which is going to come out soon, which i'm very excited about
[11:48.100 --> 11:52.060]  And I talked about that you have to view like the game world
[11:52.060 --> 11:55.120]  As our world like it's a shared history
[11:55.120 --> 12:02.620]  And then you said that you view all fiction through that lens already like that's just how you interpret stuff
[12:02.620 --> 12:09.300]  You consume unless i'm told otherwise by the author or uh, pretty quickly. I assume anything
[12:10.060 --> 12:12.980]  that i'm reading exists in my timeline, so
[12:13.660 --> 12:20.200]  My question is does that mean you inject yourself into every story that would fall under that category
[12:20.200 --> 12:22.960]  Like you're not part of the story, but you're in that world
[12:23.640 --> 12:27.700]  I guess in some sense. Yes, that uh, that would that that tracks. Yeah
[12:27.700 --> 12:32.960]  It's just such a weird thing to like watch. I don't know like entourage would be like yeah
[12:32.960 --> 12:37.000]  I'm in this universe. I could I could show up right behind vinny chase at any moment
[12:37.460 --> 12:42.180]  Unfortunately, i've never seen an episode of entourage. So I don't know you're not missing anything at this about that one
[12:42.180 --> 12:43.740]  but uh, but like
[12:44.480 --> 12:49.740]  Do have I ever thought like watching lost could I end up on the island? Yeah, of course
[12:51.420 --> 12:52.820]  I love that
[12:53.360 --> 12:59.820]  Yeah, isn't that why we watch stuff to be to get invested in stories? No, no, not for myself
[13:00.420 --> 13:05.040]  I I'm, I like the escapism but a part of escapism is that i'm not there
[13:05.700 --> 13:06.180]  Yeah
[13:06.760 --> 13:08.560]  I can appreciate it on that level too
[13:08.560 --> 13:13.960]  But man, I I love that I love to think about like how I would interact with a world or
[13:15.600 --> 13:16.320]  Yeah, absolutely
[13:16.820 --> 13:21.180]  Those are two different things because I agree with that like thinking about how I'd interact with the world is funny
[13:21.180 --> 13:25.860]  The way that you're setting it up to me is hilarious of like watching lost being like oh
[13:25.860 --> 13:29.520]  I wonder if i'm gonna show up this season. Will I be there? I could be there
[13:29.960 --> 13:32.980]  No, i'm not wondering if I got cast in lost and didn't know about it
[13:32.980 --> 13:36.720]  Unfortunately, I do I do know about it because i'm me I didn't get cast in lost
[13:36.720 --> 13:41.520]  But i'm just saying like if you're watching lost you never and the plane crashes or whatever and you never think like oh
[13:41.520 --> 13:44.180]  I fly to australia sometimes hope I don't end up on that island
[13:44.180 --> 13:48.440]  You've never just thought about that before like like it exists in our world right now
[13:48.440 --> 13:55.480]  No, because it takes place during our time. I've never worried about crashing onto the lost island. Can I just be honest with you?
[13:55.900 --> 14:00.300]  Yes, please. I I I honestly and please don't take this the wrong way. I feel really sorry for you
[14:00.880 --> 14:05.540]  No, that's fair. That's fine. I I feel like I get a I feel like I get a much more
[14:06.460 --> 14:07.340]  Fun and
[14:08.360 --> 14:14.380]  Explorative, uh relationship with content if I I feel like there's a whole angle I get to enjoy that you don't and that just seems
[14:14.380 --> 14:16.920]  Sad to me. No, I appreciate it. That's very fair
[14:16.920 --> 14:23.740]  Yeah, I mean, I definitely think that I I put myself in certain situations in just like little thoughts, but I I don't feel like i'm
[14:24.460 --> 14:27.780]  Constantly there. I don't watch the sopranos and think oh man
[14:27.780 --> 14:33.280]  Tony soprano might whack me like that's it's a show that i'm watching and yeah, you live in canada
[14:33.280 --> 14:34.220]  What would he be doing up there?
[14:35.540 --> 14:40.800]  That's a great point. That is the biggest hole. That is the biggest hole in that happening. Yeah, I got there
[14:41.400 --> 14:47.480]  I mean you've been to new jersey jeff. I lived in new jersey for yeah. Yeah. I mean that's uh, it's pretty dangerous
[14:47.480 --> 14:49.440]  Tony sopranos might whack you
[14:49.920 --> 14:52.540]  Uh, I was never worried about getting whacked by the character
[14:52.540 --> 15:00.720]  but if you're asking if when I lived in new jersey, I didn't think constantly about the mafia and construction dudes and dudes and like
[15:00.720 --> 15:04.800]  that whole world, of course I did every time you drive by and you see like, uh,
[15:04.800 --> 15:09.280]  You see like a landfill and somebody dumping stuff. You're like, uh, but there's bodies in that. I mean like
[15:09.840 --> 15:13.200]  That's what living in new jersey is right, but I don't think that's what he's asking you
[15:13.200 --> 15:16.100]  I think he's asking about specifically tony soprano the tv show
[15:16.700 --> 15:22.040]  In the same way that you were concerned about no i'm never no, I wasn't worried about tony soprano
[15:22.040 --> 15:29.400]  You can't act like that's a ridiculous question when you just said you've never thought about crashing onto the lost island. It's the same thing
[15:31.380 --> 15:31.900]  I
[15:31.900 --> 15:33.320]  Guess the exact same
[15:33.320 --> 15:34.700]  I guess yeah, sure
[15:34.700 --> 15:37.000]  I feel like the lost island is a little more
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.260]  I feel like the lost island is a little more of a fantastic playground
[15:40.260 --> 15:46.420]  Whereas, uh, the sopranos was sort of a rooted in reality crime drama, you know, that's true
[15:46.420 --> 15:48.840]  I feel like there's there's like there's less room for
[15:49.440 --> 15:55.220]  Experimental play in your brain when a show is that uh believable and grounded in reality
[15:55.220 --> 15:57.640]  Whereas lost is a made-up island
[15:58.240 --> 15:59.900]  In the middle of the ocean that has
[16:00.520 --> 16:01.700]  Magic things happen to it
[16:01.700 --> 16:04.260]  So it does it seems a little less weird for me to
[16:04.260 --> 16:09.320]  Have a daydream where I end up on the island and and and get to experience the smoke monster or whatever
[16:09.320 --> 16:10.200]  That seems a little more
[16:10.200 --> 16:14.760]  I feel like I feel like it's I don't know more excusable because I don't think any of it's inexcusable
[16:14.760 --> 16:16.740]  but I feel like it makes a little more sense for me to
[16:17.180 --> 16:23.080]  For my mind to fit to play in that world than it would for me to be worried about big pussy killing me when i'm not
[16:23.080 --> 16:27.620]  Looking at gavin. Were you ever were you ever excited to hang out with? Mr. Bean or what?
[16:27.640 --> 16:28.600]  He met him
[16:30.920 --> 16:32.940]  I didn't think it would ever happen. Um
[16:33.420 --> 16:37.020]  I still think it won't but it would be amazing imagine hanging out with Mr. Bean
[16:37.420 --> 16:40.980]  You met him at the grocery store. I mean he wasn't he wasn't in character
[16:41.960 --> 16:45.480]  Oh, I see. So you met Rowan Atkinson. I met Rowan Atkinson
[16:45.480 --> 16:48.460]  And he was with his kid and he was just being a normal dad
[16:49.500 --> 16:51.600]  Oh, he wasn't going to there and then
[16:51.600 --> 16:57.620]  I feel like i'm being made fun of but I really don't know why
[16:57.640 --> 17:01.000]  Because I don't know what I think you're very defensive today. Geoff
[17:01.400 --> 17:07.140]  I mean this and the asshole waxing thing. I think you're on guard. I don't think you're as waxed as you think you are
[17:07.140 --> 17:12.500]  I mean play back the pleasantries. I got attacked walking in. Oh, not at all. We're playing back
[17:12.500 --> 17:14.560]  I did I got attacked Gavin because
[17:14.940 --> 17:19.920]  I said, uh, oh, yeah, they were talking about the asshole waxing and Andrew asked how my asshole was and I said it's fine
[17:19.920 --> 17:23.680]  Why and I thought he meant the spicy food that I had to eat on extra life
[17:23.680 --> 17:27.460]  Because I did have like, you know, I had spicy food ass for a day. Yeah
[17:27.780 --> 17:30.720]  Uh, and he was like no is it about the waxing and I was like, oh, yeah
[17:30.720 --> 17:33.180]  I guess we can't do that this week for some reason and then I thought about for a second
[17:33.180 --> 17:38.540]  I said, oh, I guess i'm the reason and then eric jumped on me for not recognizing that I was the reason faster
[17:40.000 --> 17:43.160]  He he's like you drove around the block before you accepted responsibility
[17:43.700 --> 17:48.140]  Even though I accepted responsibility and it's like you shot the gun
[17:48.140 --> 17:52.540]  Went around the block and then went I should get in front of that thing, I guess
[17:53.440 --> 17:58.020]  It's how late was Gavin to this podcast four minutes i'll be back in four minutes
[17:58.880 --> 17:59.700]  Oh my god
[18:00.400 --> 18:06.820]  Are you guys good with gross shit? Yeah, because i'm not good with it and someone uh put on
[18:07.780 --> 18:12.280]  Put on the subreddit that when I was talking about how cool it'd be to have a dog with a handle
[18:12.280 --> 18:16.420]  And they posted this video of a horse. I didn't look at it. Did you look at it?
[18:16.680 --> 18:17.720]  No, I was too grossed out
[18:17.720 --> 18:22.360]  apparently a horse just has like a hole straight through it and I was wondering if anyone could tell me more about it without
[18:23.120 --> 18:28.440]  Yeah, without me having to look I can't do that either. I can't look at it. I have to like hide it
[18:28.440 --> 18:32.040]  I have to how do I hide this thing? I can't look at this fucking horse. It's okay
[18:32.040 --> 18:36.100]  So for the audience, it's some sort of illness this horse has I think but it's got a hole
[18:36.900 --> 18:39.340]  Right through its neck like you can see all the way through
[18:39.720 --> 18:41.500]  And I just don't know how the horse is alive
[18:41.500 --> 18:46.100]  Like is all of its important stuff going around the hole? How was it born with a hole? It's crazy
[18:46.540 --> 18:47.700]  It's kind of got a handle
[18:48.380 --> 18:51.420]  Didn't they think in ghostbusters that you could drill a hole through your head?
[18:52.780 --> 18:53.140]  uh
[18:53.140 --> 18:58.340]  I'm, pretty sure that was a in ghostbusters. I'm pretty sure that that was a one of the like this the jokes that they'd
[18:58.740 --> 19:03.340]  uh, Egon had convinced himself that he could drill a you could drill a hole through the side of your head and then
[19:03.340 --> 19:04.300]  they were like
[19:04.300 --> 19:07.580]  They referenced it as if something that they'd stopped him from doing in the past
[19:08.200 --> 19:11.040]  And then that was also what that movie pie was about you are right
[19:11.040 --> 19:13.300]  That is I just looked it up and that is a joke in
[19:14.000 --> 19:19.660]  That is a joke in ghostbusters. I don't remember that at all. How weird I don't want to look at this horse anymore
[19:19.660 --> 19:21.900]  I hate make this go away. Can you delete the horse?
[19:22.360 --> 19:23.700]  Yeah, thank you
[19:24.240 --> 19:27.160]  I don't like just you guys said you were great with gross stuff. So I just thought
[19:27.860 --> 19:30.100]  Maybe did anyone say that they were great with gross stuff?
[19:30.860 --> 19:35.360]  Uh, he's in his four minute. Oh, he really left. Oh, he's gone. Oh, I thought maybe he would step out
[19:35.360 --> 19:39.620]  Okay, I see. He doesn't want to work one minute harder than Gavin does so
[19:40.600 --> 19:43.820]  I mean if it's easy I can continue working four minutes after we end
[19:44.460 --> 19:46.860]  No, I dude i'm just happy to have you when you're here
[19:50.500 --> 19:50.980]  I
[19:50.980 --> 19:52.980]  So it just sounded so backhanded
[19:53.500 --> 19:59.340]  It wasn't I had a I had a money making dream and I don't know whether it's it might actually be a good idea
[19:59.340 --> 19:59.900]  In real life
[20:00.540 --> 20:04.440]  Oh, let's hear it in the in the dream. Uh, I had a box
[20:04.960 --> 20:10.740]  And I just kept posting pictures of this box and I kept posting that elon musk really wants what's inside the box
[20:11.740 --> 20:17.000]  Hoping that he would eventually he would get the attention i'd get his attention and he would actually buy the box off me
[20:17.540 --> 20:18.200]  this is
[20:18.980 --> 20:25.420]  This is the smartest idea in the world. This is so fucking smart gavin. This is and I kept just making videos be like
[20:25.980 --> 20:30.440]  Uh, trust me elon musk really wants what's inside this box
[20:32.780 --> 20:34.980]  And uh, yeah, maybe it's worth doing in real life
[20:35.560 --> 20:40.720]  What's in the box? Do you think it's just a usb drive? It's just really something that he wants
[20:40.740 --> 20:42.920]  Okay, trust me
[20:42.920 --> 20:44.660]  I trust you
[20:45.160 --> 20:47.920]  But I think you're gonna have to build the box and put something in it
[20:48.440 --> 20:48.900]  Yeah
[20:49.420 --> 20:52.240]  In your dream. Did you you didn't know what was in the box, right?
[20:52.840 --> 21:00.040]  I think I I knew but I don't I didn't actually know right your dream like you dream you knew but you didn't know. Yeah
[21:00.660 --> 21:01.320]  Yeah, yeah
[21:02.520 --> 21:08.300]  I wonder if uh, I wonder if if it is worth it to make a
[21:08.300 --> 21:11.040]  A musk box and then while we're at it make a bezos box
[21:11.460 --> 21:15.760]  And then we could you could plot them against each other like bezos really wants the musk box
[21:15.760 --> 21:17.720]  And then let's be like, I don't want this to be my box
[21:18.680 --> 21:25.100]  Yeah, I just put up it i'll be like on ebay. Look elon musk really wants what's in this box, but I'll sell it to anyone
[21:27.140 --> 21:31.460]  Do you have to create the hype first you're like this is the box that elon musk wants
[21:31.460 --> 21:33.700]  He wants what's in this so bad
[21:33.700 --> 21:38.940]  Geoff bezos now wants this box because elon wants it so bad and then you say
[21:38.940 --> 21:42.560]  And I will be putting it on sale on ebay like a week later. I think that's
[21:42.960 --> 21:48.900]  This is really good. This is really good. I'm liking this a lot. I do too. It worked out well in the dream
[21:49.520 --> 21:54.980]  What was the I guess like the end of the like what happened at like the end? Did you get very rich?
[21:55.500 --> 21:59.420]  No, I don't think I ever made the sale, but it was just getting really out of hand and it was and everyone was talking
[21:59.420 --> 21:59.900]  about it
[22:01.720 --> 22:02.080]  I
[22:02.080 --> 22:05.160]  Think it was heading that way. It sounds less like a dream and more like a prophecy
[22:05.160 --> 22:07.360]  I think this is something that you need to do
[22:07.800 --> 22:12.120]  Deja vu all over again. We got to get this box. I'm interested in this box
[22:12.540 --> 22:14.360]  Yeah, i'll sell it to you
[22:14.360 --> 22:17.080]  Well, here's the thing. I don't know. I don't know if I want it
[22:17.080 --> 22:22.140]  I'm, just you know, I hear a lot of people talking about the box. So i'm very interested in what's going on
[22:22.140 --> 22:23.340]  You know what's happening?
[22:24.420 --> 22:25.340]  I have a box
[22:26.760 --> 22:29.480]  Elon musk really wants what's inside it. Really?
[22:30.100 --> 22:30.440]  Yeah
[22:30.860 --> 22:31.780]  Is it tungsten?
[22:34.220 --> 22:34.560]  What?
[22:35.360 --> 22:36.460]  Is it tungsten? Is it really heavy?
[22:37.820 --> 22:38.160]  Gold?
[22:39.380 --> 22:40.580]  Silver? What's in the box?
[22:41.740 --> 22:44.740]  See it's intriguing. There you go. I'm very intrigued
[22:44.740 --> 22:49.520]  What's the way? Brad Pitt over there wants to know what's in the box. If you want instead of selling it to uh
[22:49.880 --> 22:51.300]  Elon musk i'll sell it to you Andrew
[22:51.760 --> 22:54.840]  How much? How much do you want for it? I mean, how much do you want to pay for it?
[22:56.600 --> 22:58.080]  I need to get better at this negotiation
[23:01.520 --> 23:03.580]  I'll send you another order of mcdonald's for your box
[23:04.260 --> 23:04.820]  Oh, yeah
[23:05.660 --> 23:10.780]  That's all you got to pay to get the box was mcdonald's unless someone wants to give me more for it
[23:11.300 --> 23:11.940]  Going once
[23:12.400 --> 23:16.660]  No, that's fine going twice. I mean, I think I think you're just selling it too early
[23:16.660 --> 23:19.960]  I think you have to like really get it on the open. I thought you were gonna put it on sold
[23:19.960 --> 23:22.600]  Yeah, that's a good point. Uh void void sale
[23:23.280 --> 23:23.600]  What?
[23:24.500 --> 23:24.900]  That
[23:27.280 --> 23:32.440]  I got a feeling andrew that if you had been here four minutes ago, you wouldn't want this box. Anyway, oh really?
[23:33.160 --> 23:38.600]  Yeah, but but I also think that there's a world where you definitely want the box more now
[23:39.340 --> 23:40.600]  I just need to
[23:41.100 --> 23:45.680]  Was it ever explained what was in the box kind of? Yeah. Oh, fuck
[23:46.260 --> 23:50.500]  The closest you're gonna come is you're gonna have to wait till this episode comes out and go back and listen to it
[23:50.500 --> 23:56.940]  I will now he'll he'll perv on the files. No, I will. Yeah, you're right perv on the file
[23:56.940 --> 23:59.120]  He's a he's a file perver
[24:00.440 --> 24:04.700]  Yeah, he'll go to the google drive and start listening to our individual tracks
[24:05.880 --> 24:10.900]  Are you a file pervert andrew? Well, I dabble in some file perving i'll be honest
[24:12.420 --> 24:15.640]  What when you file perv what do you get out of that? What are you looking for?
[24:15.640 --> 24:21.600]  Uh, it's mainly like so the last time I did it was when I left the show for the austin thing with the cucumber
[24:21.600 --> 24:26.500]  To hear your guys reaction. Oh, yeah went to all the the files. So it's just stuff I missed
[24:27.300 --> 24:28.560]  or if uh
[24:28.560 --> 24:33.080]  Somebody did something that I thought was really funny going back to it. So not very often
[24:33.640 --> 24:39.160]  No, it's only happened less than I don't know three or four times. Yeah, what figures that tracks? Yeah
[24:39.900 --> 24:41.900]  I'm, sorry about that. I had to use the bathroom
[24:41.900 --> 24:45.800]  That's why I left I was trying my best to hold but I used the gavin excuse
[24:47.120 --> 24:51.580]  That's not the same as being late though. If you leave well, it's i'd say at least I was here
[24:51.580 --> 24:56.740]  I let people know so oh, wait a minute. So are we confirming that you're not in the bathtub for this episode?
[24:57.040 --> 25:02.020]  No, no, no, not in the tub. It was too dangerous. I was giving away too much information. I was too relaxed
[25:02.840 --> 25:04.060]  We can't do that again
[25:05.580 --> 25:09.640]  Your guard was too down my guard was way too down while in the tub
[25:11.060 --> 25:15.880]  It also was just a nightmare because it's kind of echoey so I was trying to do my best to mitigate that but then I
[25:15.880 --> 25:20.140]  Was just like holding a shower curtain in front of my face while I was talking for large sections
[25:20.680 --> 25:25.220]  I made trying to look at my notes really difficult. There were some disadvantages to it
[25:25.220 --> 25:30.480]  We need to work out if we wanted to continue bathtub recording, but so for now i'm back at my desk
[25:30.480 --> 25:37.660]  Do you know what's been a huge disadvantage in my life? What if I meet a dog giant nose with it? What?
[25:38.360 --> 25:41.420]  I thought you I thought he was gonna say being british, but oh
[25:42.180 --> 25:44.320]  You meet a dog if I meet a dog
[25:44.880 --> 25:46.420]  And it's got a human name
[25:46.960 --> 25:49.760]  It's burned into my head that that is a dog's name
[25:50.300 --> 25:51.580]  for the rest of my life
[25:51.580 --> 25:57.980]  So henry is a dog's name to you now. No, no, because I knew a henry before I heard it as a dog's name
[25:57.980 --> 25:59.700]  I see I see
[25:59.700 --> 26:04.760]  So like anytime I meet like a cleo or a monty or like a tilly
[26:04.760 --> 26:07.900]  It's like these are all dogs from my childhood and it's so confusing to me
[26:07.900 --> 26:11.480]  So you always thought of so it bothered you that monty's name was monty
[26:11.920 --> 26:16.600]  No, I got used to it. Okay, but you always thought of it as a dog's name before a human's name
[26:17.280 --> 26:17.680]  Yeah
[26:19.260 --> 26:24.040]  Interesting. Like do you have that with any uh childhood animals that you knew?
[26:27.020 --> 26:32.860]  No, i'm trying to think I mean I had terrible names for my pets I had a fish named fluffy
[26:34.000 --> 26:35.660]  Not that's a cute name for a fish
[26:36.600 --> 26:43.320]  Yeah, my first my first cat was named smoky and I don't think i've ever met a smoky that's a great
[26:43.320 --> 26:45.940]  But if I did I might think of my cat
[26:45.940 --> 26:50.820]  Can I ask about it going the other way? What if you get an animal and you name it after a person?
[26:51.780 --> 26:57.020]  Like it's a name that like you knowingly like I had an idea in college that I wanted to get like a cat and name
[26:57.020 --> 26:58.440]  It after my roommate david burger
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.620]  And just name the cat david burger and then like yell at it because it's not doing
[27:03.620 --> 27:08.620]  A very good job at being david burger, which it sort of doesn't really understand what that is
[27:08.620 --> 27:12.260]  But I think naming an animal after a person that you know that you live with
[27:12.720 --> 27:16.380]  It can lead to confusion, but I think it'll also lead to like a lot of fun
[27:16.920 --> 27:20.240]  Like howard stern named his bulldog. Bianca romaine stamos
[27:23.100 --> 27:27.560]  Yeah, all my cats are named after dead actors or dead legends
[27:28.540 --> 27:32.040]  Yeah, didn't didn't robin have a cat named jennifer aniston, I think
[27:32.760 --> 27:36.340]  And you had bob hoss smy as bob hoss. What was the cat's full name?
[27:37.020 --> 27:41.940]  Smy technically his full name's full name is bob hoskins is smy bob hoskins is smy
[27:45.440 --> 27:52.080]  Have you ever explained the dave burger idea to people eric outside of this thing or is this just a thing you're gonna do
[27:52.080 --> 27:57.380]  No, i've explained it to other people before i've also explained it to david burger
[27:57.380 --> 27:59.020]  And he wasn't thrilled at the time
[27:59.440 --> 28:02.320]  Then that wouldn't work because you don't live with him. That's true
[28:02.320 --> 28:06.820]  And so no i'm just maybe i'm maybe it's less of an idea that I will do and if you
[28:06.820 --> 28:09.980]  Like it if you're listening to this at home and you're like i'm gonna get a cat
[28:09.980 --> 28:14.780]  Maybe i'll name it after my roommate. This is now you'd have to name your cat small wife. Oh
[28:15.320 --> 28:18.520]  Or yeah, or hey if you're listening to this and you're gonna get a cat or a dog
[28:18.520 --> 28:22.500]  Maybe name it eric baddour. I don't know why you would do that. That's the opposite
[28:22.500 --> 28:24.860]  I'm saying the person you live with is the fun situation
[28:24.860 --> 28:29.240]  That's what i'm saying not name it after don't name a cat after me
[28:29.240 --> 28:33.300]  I think you should name it after eric. I think you should eric baddour the cat. You don't have to do that
[28:33.300 --> 28:34.560]  Everyone else spell it wrong
[28:37.100 --> 28:38.220]  It's whole life
[28:39.560 --> 28:45.160]  Then all the people who meet the cat before they meet you will think it's weird that your name is eric baddour
[28:45.160 --> 28:46.160]  That would be okay
[28:46.160 --> 28:53.160]  So that would be crazy if you met the cat and then found out like about this show like years later
[28:53.160 --> 28:57.320]  And then me and you're like, oh I had a friend who had a cat named eric baddour
[28:57.320 --> 29:01.660]  All right. I might be on board for this now this might just for just for like the long game
[29:01.660 --> 29:05.720]  The advantage the cat has over you is it won't realize its name is spelled wrong
[29:05.720 --> 29:09.840]  None of it means advantage that the cat will have over me
[29:09.840 --> 29:15.620]  Yeah, because you can get annoyed by the fact that you see your name spelled wrong and none of the cat doesn't know to read
[29:15.620 --> 29:16.180]  letters
[29:16.180 --> 29:18.080]  None of it makes sense to the cat
[29:19.120 --> 29:19.740]  that's the
[29:20.980 --> 29:24.900]  Advantage yeah, there are a few advantages that the cat has that's one of them
[29:25.420 --> 29:29.260]  Another one other advantages the cat claws night vision
[29:29.960 --> 29:31.320]  night vision claws
[29:33.340 --> 29:36.900]  Smell when you get older as a cat, you can't retract the claws
[29:36.900 --> 29:42.040]  So you don't want to always be claws out like that could be a problem. There's a disadvantage with claws as well
[29:42.040 --> 29:47.600]  Well, it's I mean they kind of they come with advantages and disadvantages. Uh, you can jump real good. You always land on your feet
[29:48.280 --> 29:48.720]  uh
[29:48.720 --> 29:51.800]  Better warmth protection i'd say being able to
[29:51.800 --> 29:55.820]  Being able to poop in a box of sand whenever you feel like it's pretty good
[29:55.820 --> 30:01.240]  That doesn't that feels like something I could do if I wanted to yeah, but it's not it's frowned upon
[30:01.240 --> 30:06.150]  You get celebrated if you do that as cat better at birding and micing than you are
[30:08.780 --> 30:14.940]  Birding and micing. Yeah, like it could kill birds and mice better than you. I just didn't know there were terms for that
[30:14.940 --> 30:16.480]  I think so. Yeah
[30:16.480 --> 30:19.280]  I don't know about micing, but i've heard birding before I assume
[30:20.800 --> 30:27.020]  That's different you've explained that cats are cats are better at dogging than you are
[30:28.300 --> 30:33.720]  I made a discovery the other day about my cat. Uh, bob hoskins is smi. He understands pointing
[30:34.560 --> 30:35.040]  Okay
[30:35.600 --> 30:36.540]  like most cats
[30:37.200 --> 30:40.200]  If you point at something if like sometimes i'm like look look at bird out there
[30:40.200 --> 30:44.660]  It just looks at your finger because it doesn't understand that a point it doesn't understand what that means
[30:44.660 --> 30:49.020]  But smi actually knows to look where i'm pointing and it really freaked me out
[30:49.020 --> 30:55.580]  So you send out the applications to harvard or like what was the response to realizing your cat recognized points?
[30:56.000 --> 30:57.380]  Yeah, what is the cat equivalent of harvard?
[30:58.720 --> 30:59.140]  harvard
[31:00.740 --> 31:05.620]  For cats it just lives in the dorms. You would send it to a meow-niversity
[31:07.420 --> 31:08.080]  Thank you
[31:09.580 --> 31:13.040]  Thank you, nobody said what was the last time we read from the joke book
[31:14.120 --> 31:17.880]  I don't know where I need to find the joke book. Maybe it's time to get a different year
[31:18.560 --> 31:24.480]  Yeah. Oh, that's actually a great idea like go further back. I wonder if there's like a the jokes of 98
[31:26.880 --> 31:27.640]  The jokes
[31:32.040 --> 31:37.260]  I ate that I had I had a crazy encounter with somebody in a grocery store. Do you want to hear a joke?
[31:38.540 --> 31:38.920]  Yeah
[31:39.980 --> 31:43.800]  Oh, oh, i'm, sorry meow-niversity doesn't want to hear any comedy
[31:45.940 --> 31:52.640]  That's the anniversary of when two cats fall in love. Meow-niversity is where a cat goes to get higher education. Jesus christ
[31:52.640 --> 31:57.460]  Yeah, that was a fumble. I have a terrible joke if you want to hear it. Yeah
[31:58.420 --> 31:59.240]  this is
[31:59.240 --> 32:02.680]  So for context I was in line at a grocery store
[32:02.680 --> 32:06.480]  And there's an older woman in front of me that you could just tell
[32:06.480 --> 32:11.960]  Was sort of uh crazy, you know how you just sometimes get crazy vibes off of people. Were you checking out?
[32:12.200 --> 32:17.580]  Oh, you like I was checking out. Yeah, I was in line to check out and there's this this older lady in front of me
[32:17.580 --> 32:19.420]  and she asked
[32:20.140 --> 32:23.960]  The person behind the counter. Hey, do you want to hear a joke? I write my own jokes
[32:24.980 --> 32:30.960]  And so I overheard this joke that she told and he's like, I guess and this is this is her great joke
[32:31.440 --> 32:32.240]  there are two
[32:33.080 --> 32:34.320]  There are two on your this is
[32:35.360 --> 32:37.280]  This is so bad, they're two one-year-olds
[32:37.840 --> 32:39.540]  Uh, and they're at the doctor's office
[32:40.280 --> 32:42.700]  And uh, one of them says to the other one
[32:42.700 --> 32:45.580]  Oh, why are you here? What are you getting done?
[32:46.080 --> 32:51.280]  And the one says oh i'm getting my consoles removed and and the one said oh, that's great
[32:51.280 --> 32:57.400]  You're gonna get like so much candy. I had that done myself. You get treats and stuff after it. It's fantastic
[32:57.400 --> 32:58.600]  You're gonna have a great time
[32:59.120 --> 33:00.180]  What are you here for?
[33:00.760 --> 33:03.620]  And and the other one says oh i'm here to get circumcised
[33:04.320 --> 33:09.480]  And then and then it says back to him. Oh, that's rough last time that happened to me. I didn't walk for a year
[33:12.780 --> 33:13.960]  That was her joke
[33:16.400 --> 33:18.040]  That was a written joke
[33:18.760 --> 33:21.240]  She just walks around and does that to people
[33:22.320 --> 33:29.140]  Did you know in 1998 that titanic overtook jurassic park to become the highest grossing film of all time?
[33:29.220 --> 33:30.060]  You can tell this is a little dated
[33:30.660 --> 33:35.240]  I guess the titanic can't survive an iceberg, but it can beat a spielberg
[33:36.920 --> 33:43.940]  Uh, what do monica lewinsky and a vending machine have in common? This is not very good. This is not
[33:44.720 --> 33:51.300]  This is i'm trying i'm i'm being very loud about this as i'm distancing myself from whatever's about to happen
[33:51.300 --> 33:55.360]  Let it happen. What did what did billy mays do on 12 31 1998?
[33:56.700 --> 33:58.360]  He partied like it's 1999
[34:00.940 --> 34:02.020]  $19.99
[34:03.260 --> 34:05.540]  Oh, was he still alive at that point?
[34:06.280 --> 34:09.340]  I assume so. Yeah, what was the vending machine one?
[34:10.620 --> 34:12.480]  Here's one time zones are weird
[34:13.240 --> 34:19.040]  In australia, it's 2020 in america. It's 2019 in des moines. It's 1998 in alabama
[34:19.040 --> 34:21.920]  It's 1865 and in saudi arabia. It's 1576
[34:23.180 --> 34:25.660]  So that was just a joke with 1998 in it
[34:25.660 --> 34:30.640]  Yeah, I just googled 1998 jokes and that one popped up I realized as I read it that it was just I think that that's
[34:30.640 --> 34:31.220]  the only connection
[34:31.220 --> 34:31.900]  Uh
[34:35.280 --> 34:38.500]  Uh, oh did fidel castro die in 1998?
[34:39.040 --> 34:46.060]  All right, that's it that's enough if you're looking to name your pet something fidel castro is available
[34:46.820 --> 34:50.620]  Feel free. I think our worst bits on this podcast, uh
[34:50.620 --> 34:52.020]  intentional jokes
[34:52.620 --> 34:55.840]  Like whenever we're talking about jokes or doing jokes
[34:55.840 --> 34:57.700]  Horrendous. Yeah
[34:58.860 --> 34:59.880]  It's not great
[35:01.380 --> 35:01.860]  Ugh
[35:03.180 --> 35:03.980]  All right
[35:10.050 --> 35:11.950]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. Listen
[35:13.030 --> 35:16.910]  Ad break, but I have an important message if you're canadian

[35:53.710 --> 35:58.270]  And the straw is an absolute nightmare in a way that you have to experience
[35:58.270 --> 36:01.370]  We're going to try to do a gerpler chug coming up
[36:01.370 --> 36:07.190]  Uh using the face silly straw and it might take us an hour to get through it
[36:07.190 --> 36:11.810]  It is the least effective straw i've ever experienced, but I would highly recommend it
[36:11.810 --> 36:15.870]  And we also have tons of sloppy clocks, which are awesome. I have one on my wall
[36:16.390 --> 36:21.890]  It's great for me to look and go. Holy shit. It's slop time and they're just also really cool looking clocks

[36:35.150 --> 36:39.990]  This show is sponsored by better help. We are in the holiday season
[36:40.590 --> 36:45.650]  and it's a really exhausting time of year in so many ways and it's also like
[36:46.090 --> 36:47.710]  a really um
[36:47.710 --> 36:54.470]  For me emotionally fulfilling time. I love being able to get gifts for people. That's something that's really exciting for me
[36:55.030 --> 36:56.210]  sometimes though
[36:56.550 --> 36:58.610]  You know dynamics with that change
[36:59.430 --> 37:00.470]  we're pretty
[37:00.470 --> 37:06.110]  a heavy gift giving family, but there are years where like my mom will not want a gift or
[37:06.110 --> 37:10.670]  You know just all sorts of different options, but what's really important
[37:11.350 --> 37:15.390]  During this time of year is to also not forget to take care of yourself
[37:15.390 --> 37:22.510]  And also treat yourself like that's really important. That's something that I have been bad at in the past of um
[37:22.510 --> 37:27.190]  For a variety of reasons not taking care of myself or investing
[37:27.730 --> 37:33.330]  The time or treating myself in the way that I should because it's uh a lot easier
[37:33.330 --> 37:38.750]  I find to do that for other people than it is yourself, but you always deserve that time
[37:38.750 --> 37:43.430]  Um, and that's something that I had to learn and then even after learning it
[37:44.030 --> 37:45.010]  come to terms with
[37:45.630 --> 37:48.310]  Uh, which is something that therapy helped me with
[37:48.310 --> 37:50.050]  uh in so many ways
[37:50.590 --> 37:51.390]  It's not just
[37:51.950 --> 37:52.850]  identifying a problem
[37:52.850 --> 37:56.070]  but then for me at least coming up with solutions and systems that
[37:56.070 --> 38:00.350]  Work for me because as great as it is to just talk about things
[38:00.350 --> 38:06.790]  being able to talk to an expert and come up with a plan and different approaches of attack and also just accepting that
[38:06.790 --> 38:11.850]  maybe solutions you have might not work, but then being able to continue to
[38:11.850 --> 38:13.810]  attack the problem or just
[38:13.810 --> 38:19.730]  Focus on the problem and come up with alternate solutions. Therapy is wonderful. I'd highly recommend it to anyone

[39:34.270 --> 39:36.050]  Love me some titty milk
[39:36.050 --> 39:42.370]  Best titty milk on the market, but they have all sorts of flavors. They don't just have that they got snake oil flavor. They got
[39:42.370 --> 39:49.410]  Uh, so many other delicious blends that you could have. I don't know why I said blends. That's typically a coffee thing, but seriously
[39:50.170 --> 39:50.610]  fantastic

[41:54.870 --> 42:00.590]  Have a question for you guys that's thinking about is the question should this episode come out because I don't have the answer
[42:00.590 --> 42:04.170]  No, relax. Calm down. Listen, you're gonna get married in like a week
[42:04.170 --> 42:07.430]  This isn't a time for you to have one of these negative spirals for your head
[42:07.430 --> 42:12.330]  Oh, i'm not no i'm not negatively spiraling. We're far enough ahead that we can flush this one and still be fine
[42:12.330 --> 42:18.410]  No, it's fine. Second. My question is have there been amazing experiences that were wasted on you?
[42:18.870 --> 42:22.470]  Like for me as an example, do you remember I told that story about
[42:22.470 --> 42:23.030]  uh
[42:23.030 --> 42:26.870]  The last straw when I was with my cousins and my grandma and she told us to shut up
[42:26.870 --> 42:30.910]  We were we went on that trip to see Cirque du Soleil
[42:30.910 --> 42:36.450]  Which is I think one of like the biggest circuses in the world. Like it's this very can you say it again?
[42:36.990 --> 42:41.430]  No, I can't uh Cirque du Soleil. Okay. Thank you. Well, how should I say it?
[42:41.510 --> 42:44.190]  I just want to make sure that's what you're saying. I just wanted I was just asking. Okay
[42:45.030 --> 42:48.830]  Getting clarity. Okay. Well, anyway, I went to that
[42:48.830 --> 42:53.930]  So I saw it's a spectacle show obviously like these top of the line whatever in that field
[42:54.470 --> 42:57.870]  the only things I remember from that experience are
[42:57.870 --> 43:03.790]  A piece of confetti on the ground after the show ended and walking into the tent
[43:03.790 --> 43:07.710]  How big the electrical cables were running out of the thing?
[43:08.010 --> 43:10.610]  I don't remember a single detail
[43:11.170 --> 43:16.790]  Of the performance at all. Those are the only two things that are actually in my brain. You just took away like logistics
[43:17.250 --> 43:21.250]  Yeah, well, I saw the cable and I thought wow, that's a thick cable
[43:21.250 --> 43:24.550]  That would suck the trip over and then years later
[43:24.550 --> 43:31.170]  A UFC fighter blew out his knee tripping over an electrical cable while doing an interview on Fox. It's like I was justified
[43:31.170 --> 43:34.850]  That was an understandable fear by me. I called that
[43:34.850 --> 43:38.210]  So I was curious if you guys had those where like people
[43:38.670 --> 43:44.490]  Spent money or or brought you on this adventure or this experience that is notable
[43:44.490 --> 43:51.070]  But you didn't take anything away from it. Oh, I'm sure that's how Gavin and Eric feel about the NBA Summer League trip
[43:51.070 --> 43:53.630]  I made him go on. Oh, I had such a great time at that
[43:53.630 --> 43:58.110]  I was gonna say going to the Grand Canyon when I was a kid. I uh, I love the Summer League
[43:58.110 --> 44:00.750]  I thought that was fun as hell. Yeah, I had fun of that. I would say for me
[44:00.750 --> 44:03.570]  It's gonna be like fancy stuff like a nice
[44:04.010 --> 44:04.910]  wine or something
[44:04.910 --> 44:05.230]  I could
[44:06.950 --> 44:12.030]  Waste it on me Andrew. My first thought was like yeah every time I've ever eaten sushi
[44:12.610 --> 44:17.030]  Really? Really? Yeah, which is like like I go to Uchiko or whatever and it's fine
[44:17.030 --> 44:23.850]  But I don't enjoy eating sushi as much as I would just enjoy having a pastrami sandwich somewhere, you know
[44:23.850 --> 44:26.990]  But i'll eat it because everybody around me is in heaven and it's fun
[44:26.990 --> 44:32.630]  it's fun to be around people enjoying something that much to get sort of an understanding like Uchi is a
[44:32.630 --> 44:35.050]  Very expensive high-end
[44:35.650 --> 44:43.310]  Sushi place here in Austin Gavin. You've been yeah. Yes. How much better is it than just getting like regular, you know, like quick sushi
[44:44.490 --> 44:45.890]  It's probably incomparable
[44:47.350 --> 44:53.910]  Gavin is maybe the worst person to ask also you said you got sleep Gavin that was fucking 40 seconds as just
[44:55.050 --> 44:58.510]  Being time now on probation. Well, I was thinking are you talking like
[44:58.510 --> 45:04.810]  Are you talking like rolls or like well, I mean jeff is saying that like he gets sushi and he's like it's fine
[45:04.810 --> 45:07.570]  You know, it's sushi whatever but you've had regular just you know
[45:07.570 --> 45:14.630]  Sushi, whatever and then you've gone to Uchi like is like the is really like the gap between like regular sushi and Uchi
[45:14.630 --> 45:20.350]  Like really really high like is it very it's like super high end. I've had sushi from H-E-B more than i've had it from Uchi
[45:22.190 --> 45:23.630]  Right, but how do they compare?
[45:23.630 --> 45:27.930]  Yeah, jesus christ, let me answer i've had grocery store sushi eric and i've had
[45:27.930 --> 45:33.870]  High-end restaurant sushi and they taste completely different like the rice you could tell is a better quality
[45:33.870 --> 45:36.490]  Just all of the ingredients feel fresher
[45:36.490 --> 45:42.370]  It is a substantial taste difference between the two products for me. I could tell it's it's lower quality
[45:42.370 --> 45:46.350]  But it's still not it doesn't justify the leap in price. Like I would still happily
[45:46.870 --> 45:52.510]  Yeah, but you would if you could you would eat a flavorless protein brick every day that just gave you nutrients
[45:52.510 --> 45:55.870]  Yeah, that's true. Yeah, so like wait
[45:56.530 --> 45:59.750]  Gavin has zero respect for for food or drink
[46:01.450 --> 46:01.890]  Uh
[46:03.210 --> 46:09.710]  Yeah, I mean I I can eat the same thing every day. I it doesn't need I don't need my mouth to be that excited
[46:12.780 --> 46:16.060]  Like I just want it to be not repulsive and just glide down
[46:18.040 --> 46:19.880]  What are you saying
[46:20.620 --> 46:22.360]  He i'm not a fancy guy
[46:23.180 --> 46:27.720]  No, but that's not even having an excited mouth doesn't mean fancy
[46:30.700 --> 46:36.780]  I had a chocolate chip cookie the other day gavin. My mouth was very excited. It was not a fancy thing
[46:36.780 --> 46:38.020]  It's a two dollar cookie
[46:38.620 --> 46:43.400]  You're just not a taste guy and i'm not i'm not judging you for that. That's an established thing for yeah
[46:43.400 --> 46:44.480]  I'm, not a big taste guy
[46:45.060 --> 46:51.340]  I'm surprised eric didn't realize this. Uh, well, I yeah, I didn't know that he would eat a protein brick or whatever every day
[46:51.340 --> 46:54.580]  I just figured that he was the only other person here who had been to uchi
[46:54.980 --> 46:56.260]  He just wants
[46:56.820 --> 47:00.020]  Food to be efficient as possible and gavin's what?
[47:00.560 --> 47:03.340]  Yeah, like he is. I don't know why i'm talking on behalf of gavin. You're here
[47:03.340 --> 47:05.960]  Yeah, if there was food that was like three times as efficient
[47:07.500 --> 47:12.000]  Like if I only needs to eat in the morning and then not eat until the next morning I would take that
[47:12.000 --> 47:18.980]  Isn't that what all those protein like huel and uh, like soylent and all that shit is though there's like meal
[47:18.980 --> 47:26.020]  Like yes scientifically designed meal replacements that are just like weird green powder like you could do it you could live like that now
[47:26.700 --> 47:31.300]  Hmm, how healthy is that? I think it's super healthy. That's why it's a big deal. Oh
[47:31.820 --> 47:36.680]  We should try putting you on one of those because from what I understand like they hit your nutrients
[47:36.680 --> 47:42.180]  But they taste awful to the point where I feel like it's been outlawed in some places those bricks
[47:42.180 --> 47:44.940]  Eating just takes quite a long time, especially if you go out
[47:45.460 --> 47:46.560]  right, but isn't that the
[47:46.560 --> 47:47.140]  It
[47:47.640 --> 47:49.440]  It's more than just the eating isn't it?
[47:49.560 --> 47:52.740]  It's like the experience hanging out with friends like even even I recognize
[47:52.740 --> 47:55.980]  While i've never had grocery store sushi before
[47:55.980 --> 47:57.500]  When I go to uchiko
[47:57.500 --> 48:02.020]  It's kind of a whole event and you put on nice clothes and you feel fancy and you have
[48:02.020 --> 48:07.020]  Like a lot of fun with you go doubles date or something and you like you have conversations
[48:07.020 --> 48:09.620]  And you try stuff you wouldn't normally try
[48:09.620 --> 48:12.420]  But in austin, it's just really
[48:13.200 --> 48:16.600]  Loud people all around you and if you're like at the sushi bar
[48:16.600 --> 48:20.600]  You got like some knobhead next to you who just won't stop talking to the chef
[48:20.600 --> 48:21.640]  And I just uncomfortable
[48:23.840 --> 48:25.140]  Like shut up guy
[48:26.160 --> 48:28.580]  Just order your protein brick and leave
[48:28.580 --> 48:35.260]  No, stop talking the whole time and he's not clearing all our little bowls because you've still got freaking food in yours. Shut up
[48:35.260 --> 48:36.520]  That's how I feel
[48:37.960 --> 48:39.200]  There you go, I hope that
[48:39.200 --> 48:46.820]  I wish you could have seen my face eric when you went to ask gavin a question about differences in taste between the two products
[48:47.300 --> 48:49.540]  Had no idea that this was a thing that
[48:49.540 --> 48:51.880]  You were like that. You don't care for food
[48:52.860 --> 48:55.500]  I I don't mind the occasional nice meal, but
[48:56.860 --> 48:59.800]  The occasional nice we don't want to get crazy
[49:01.720 --> 49:04.060]  We only have nice meals on occasion
[49:05.220 --> 49:09.220]  Listen I don't have the energy for my mouth to be excited 24 7
[49:09.220 --> 49:14.220]  We gotta space it out. If you just combine all the time in a day that you spend eating. It's quite a lot of time
[49:14.820 --> 49:15.620]  He's too busy
[49:16.160 --> 49:17.600]  He needs that time for editing
[49:18.060 --> 49:19.240]  He does. Yeah
[49:19.860 --> 49:25.160]  Were you four minutes late gavin because you were you're enjoying something you were lost in your palate
[49:26.960 --> 49:28.440]  Your palate is a wonderland
[49:29.620 --> 49:35.640]  So when you taste something and it's exciting to your mouth, do you get annoyed with yourself for liking it are you like
[49:36.780 --> 49:42.020]  Great enjoyment. Great question. I'll take the enjoyment. I just don't ever seek that out
[49:42.620 --> 49:46.700]  Gavin having a like delicious bite of steak and just slamming the table
[49:47.440 --> 49:48.440]  fucking great
[49:49.480 --> 49:54.180]  Listen if a delicious piece of steak falls in my mouth, i'm not gonna kick it out
[49:54.180 --> 49:56.300]  But i'm not gonna go looking for it
[49:56.300 --> 49:59.500]  Well, like like like a massage feels amazing
[49:59.940 --> 50:03.820]  It's so relaxing feels really good, but I don't I don't go and get them
[50:04.300 --> 50:08.960]  Yeah, but you don't need them to live you like you have to eat food three times a day or you'll die
[50:08.960 --> 50:14.220]  That's true. That's a good undercut on that analogy because yeah, you're right. Yeah, you'll die if you don't eat
[50:14.220 --> 50:18.520]  Yeah, it's not it's not like you have a choice on eating or not eating you need to do it
[50:18.520 --> 50:20.220]  and if you need to do it you
[50:21.300 --> 50:22.560]  Shouldn't your mouth be excited?
[50:22.560 --> 50:26.320]  Okay, so say I invented a pill right a little acute
[50:27.220 --> 50:30.800]  Uh, I give it to you eric and you don't have to eat for six months you can
[50:30.800 --> 50:34.600]  Eat whenever you want. You can have a meal. It won't it won't uh,
[50:34.760 --> 50:37.760]  Stack up too much. Is that extra calories for you though?
[50:37.820 --> 50:42.840]  Like are you getting the caloric he will he will get all the calories he needs for six months
[50:42.840 --> 50:48.340]  So if he eats on top of it, he's gonna blow up. No, it just doesn't it doesn't count that way like he he still
[50:49.060 --> 50:52.600]  He can if he if he still eats the regular amount that's fine
[50:52.600 --> 50:57.720]  So he has like 2000 calories of 2000 flavored calories allotted daily
[50:58.220 --> 51:04.380]  He has 2000 backup calories that he can use every day, right? Yeah, eric
[51:04.380 --> 51:07.140]  Yeah, how how often do you eat?
[51:07.220 --> 51:08.200]  What the fuck?
[51:09.060 --> 51:11.800]  You've got you've got the you've got the cube inside you how often are you gonna eat?
[51:12.600 --> 51:18.420]  You've got doesn't mean generally got a cube inside the pill is a cube it's a yeah, it's a little cube
[51:18.420 --> 51:20.180]  It's like a little like how do you?
[51:20.420 --> 51:23.300]  How do you swallow a stock cube?
[51:24.360 --> 51:32.240]  What the question's about the cube the cubes come down shut up a second he was good in eric sharp edges
[51:32.240 --> 51:33.940]  All right
[51:34.700 --> 51:35.760]  I've sanded
[51:35.760 --> 51:41.700]  The cube eric's downed it. He's chugged the cube. He doesn't have to eat for six months
[51:41.800 --> 51:44.760]  Yeah, what's at the center of the cube? What's in the box christ?
[51:45.260 --> 51:45.500]  but how
[51:46.040 --> 51:48.980]  How often are you gonna eat one musk wanted that was in the box?
[51:49.780 --> 51:52.820]  guys guys don't worry about what's in the cube just
[51:54.120 --> 52:01.100]  Is it a sign of peter molyneux telling you you've won like a microtransaction away from a peter molyneux game. Oh, man
[52:01.760 --> 52:02.240]  uh
[52:02.880 --> 52:03.360]  I
[52:03.960 --> 52:05.920]  I I don't think I like
[52:06.660 --> 52:10.320]  This is beginning on a weird note because I just wouldn't take this thing
[52:10.320 --> 52:16.160]  I like food too much. You can still eat food. You can still eat all the food you would have eaten
[52:18.020 --> 52:21.000]  Why am I trying to prove what is your point?
[52:21.880 --> 52:25.600]  I'm, i'm saying would you bother eating for every meal of the day still?
[52:26.220 --> 52:27.540]  Yes. Yeah, probably
[52:27.540 --> 52:33.600]  Because it's an enjoyable experience. I I really I enjoy cooking. I enjoy food. I enjoy flavors and tastes
[52:33.600 --> 52:38.380]  I like food a lot now when your mouth gets excited for food, eric
[52:38.380 --> 52:40.720]  I get so mad at myself. Yeah
[52:40.720 --> 52:42.260]  Do you feel an intense?
[52:42.740 --> 52:44.980]  Self-loathing that you can't quite describe
[52:45.530 --> 52:48.680]  No, i've i've never thought about it in terms of my mouth being excited
[52:48.680 --> 52:54.460]  But last time I had covid I lost all sense of taste and my mouth was so depressed
[52:54.460 --> 52:59.760]  I was so sad because if everything tastes the same as somebody who enjoys food
[52:59.760 --> 53:02.820]  You realize like there's no point in getting anything like what?
[53:03.200 --> 53:07.640]  What choices do I make none of it matters? It all tastes the same. This is awful
[53:07.640 --> 53:13.160]  I was my mouth. I it hit a new sadness. It hit a sadness. I didn't know was possible. They do say
[53:13.160 --> 53:15.360]  Flavor is the spice of life
[53:15.880 --> 53:21.420]  That's you it's a it's a double-sided weapon. Uh, it's a it's a both sides of the same coin
[53:23.780 --> 53:24.860]  Uh, I
[53:24.860 --> 53:28.060]  Double-sided sword right there. I really do
[53:28.840 --> 53:33.640]  I I think that you eat because you have to and you don't enjoy it. I
[53:34.280 --> 53:35.640]  have to control
[53:36.360 --> 53:42.900]  My eating because I want I love flavor and like the sensation of eating so much
[53:43.640 --> 53:48.200]  I it's so enjoyable to me. It's so enjoyable to eat. I'd say that's the norm
[53:48.900 --> 53:52.420]  I think so too, but now you've invented a cube that you've sanded down
[53:54.280 --> 53:57.620]  And by the way, I appreciate you saying it on the cube, yeah, thank you
[53:59.980 --> 54:04.040]  If I if I ate the cube or if I ate the corners from eric's cube
[54:04.040 --> 54:06.660]  Yeah, I would probably I would eat probably once a day
[54:07.240 --> 54:10.800]  I don't even think you I don't think you would do that. I don't even think you would I disagree
[54:11.140 --> 54:15.220]  Yeah, I don't think you would eat ever. I think you would only eat in social situations
[54:15.720 --> 54:18.520]  Yeah, but I feel like it's a that's nice to have one today
[54:18.920 --> 54:23.940]  But then when you eat are you eating your flavorless protein cube? Are you eating fun food?
[54:24.560 --> 54:26.440]  No, if I was only in once a day i'd make it count
[54:27.120 --> 54:29.220]  Well, you could do that now asshole. Why don't you?
[54:29.220 --> 54:30.380]  I don't know
[54:33.260 --> 54:35.260]  You can make it count for every meal
[54:37.100 --> 54:42.160]  It absolutely counts actually let's let's go back to the episodes where andrew was the freak
[54:44.780 --> 54:49.560]  I I understand at the genesis of what you're saying is food eating the
[54:49.560 --> 54:52.520]  The prospect the concept of eating takes time out of a day
[54:52.520 --> 54:55.860]  And if you're a busy businessman like you are and you could eliminate that
[54:55.860 --> 55:00.340]  That time cost from your day it would it would add to the efficiency of your life
[55:00.340 --> 55:07.280]  I get that but there is a danger with making things so efficient that there's no fun or flavor in life itself
[55:07.280 --> 55:14.220]  And so I think that I think the break the the mandatory it probably serves multiple purposes, right other than just nourishing your body
[55:14.220 --> 55:19.900]  But it also forces you to stop what you're doing and then focus on you for a little bit at least in in terms of
[55:19.900 --> 55:23.460]  Ingesting fuel into you so that you can continue to exist
[55:23.460 --> 55:27.040]  so I'm assuming more something happens in your brain in that moment where you're like
[55:27.440 --> 55:32.460]  You're also like taking stock of your life and present in the moment and you know, it's probably you don't realize it
[55:32.460 --> 55:37.820]  But it's probably a really important check-in a couple times a day that you go through subconsciously without even knowing it
[55:37.820 --> 55:38.380]  Yeah
[55:38.380 --> 55:43.600]  I mean for me I've identified what the reason is mainly that a lot of the work I do because it's just me
[55:43.600 --> 55:46.440]  Deciding to do it whenever I do it. What's the worst?
[55:46.600 --> 55:52.760]  I don't really feel like doing it all that like if I have an edit I need to be done in two days. I
[55:52.760 --> 55:58.380]  Rarely feel like doing it most of the day and then I'll just suddenly start doing it or just get on a roll and it's
[55:58.380 --> 56:00.000]  Around that time where it's like I'm starving
[56:00.560 --> 56:04.860]  So it's like because so much of my effort it feels mood based
[56:04.860 --> 56:11.480]  It just interrupts the rare times where I feel motivated. Totally. That makes sense. I understand that I
[56:11.480 --> 56:17.540]  Similarly, I have to self-motivate myself to do stuff now and I don't ever feel like doing the thing
[56:17.540 --> 56:20.680]  I want to do I need to do like I've never felt like recording so all right, right
[56:20.680 --> 56:22.520]  But like once I do it
[56:23.000 --> 56:24.660]  Once I'm doing it. I don't want to stop
[56:25.140 --> 56:27.020]  I don't feel like stopping if that makes sense
[56:27.020 --> 56:33.000]  And so anything that gets in the way is like it was so fucking hard to spin myself up to do the thing
[56:33.480 --> 56:38.260]  Because it was so much easier not to do it and to like to fucking to sit there and yell at myself and force myself
[56:38.260 --> 56:40.420]  To get in front of the computer and start working now that I'm doing it
[56:40.420 --> 56:45.060]  I don't want anything to get in the way of it because it's because once I stop it's gonna be so much fucking harder to
[56:45.060 --> 56:45.960]  Get myself to start again
[56:46.560 --> 56:50.860]  And then also just like a hands-on task you're limiting what foods you can enjoy
[56:51.380 --> 56:55.760]  Like I have you ever tried to eat wings while playing video games nightmare doesn't work
[56:56.840 --> 56:59.420]  Absolute all-time mess ribs same way
[56:59.420 --> 57:04.140]  I think it's commercials are always like that where people are eating wings in situations that you would never eat wings
[57:04.800 --> 57:05.280]  Yes
[57:05.780 --> 57:11.280]  That's so true. I thought you meant that commercials were the time to eat wings, which is a problem I face
[57:12.500 --> 57:14.920]  Games we're like I love the innovation
[57:14.920 --> 57:18.400]  But we're now in a world where there's almost no loading screens
[57:18.400 --> 57:24.180]  And I'd have no window of time to eat my wings. It has been a real problem. The Xbox one X is too fast
[57:24.180 --> 57:25.800]  It is yes
[57:27.340 --> 57:31.900]  Sauce all over the place. There are times I've been playing the Texas Chainsaw Massacre game a lot
[57:31.900 --> 57:37.420]  I love that game and as Leatherface you're on the go constantly and there are times where I've said hey
[57:37.420 --> 57:39.980]  Can somebody else take over this role? I just want to eat some wings
[57:39.980 --> 57:43.680]  I want to get like two or three wings. There's no wing time when you're Leatherface
[57:44.320 --> 57:49.800]  Yeah, it's so funny that we're at a point where that problem is almost solved
[57:49.800 --> 57:52.960]  I was thinking the other day about I was talking to somebody who had
[57:53.600 --> 57:55.700]  Who had just moved to Austin and they were living in an apartment?
[57:55.840 --> 57:59.580]  I was thinking about apartment living and I was thinking about setting up my first apartment in
[57:59.580 --> 58:03.520]  Austin and I was trying to remember like what I did at 23 years old for fun
[58:03.520 --> 58:08.660]  I remember I used to go mountain biking and and I remember I had a ps2 and I played a shitload of
[58:10.200 --> 58:15.600]  Crash Bandicoot, I was a real big fan of Crash Bandicoot and that it triggered just that thinking like oh
[58:15.600 --> 58:20.420]  I remember I sat in the living room and played a lot of Crash Bandicoot and then I got hard triggered this memory of
[58:20.420 --> 58:25.760]  How fucking mad I used to get playing that game because I timed it the loading screens
[58:25.760 --> 58:29.020]  For Crash Bandicoot were longer than the levels
[58:29.740 --> 58:30.140]  I
[58:30.140 --> 58:33.280]  Would I would time it with it like with my watch and be like alright
[58:33.280 --> 58:40.240]  Minute and 19 seconds to get into the game and it took me a minute and eight seconds to beat the fucking level like something
[58:40.240 --> 58:44.240]  Is wrong with this and I had forgotten that I used to have that was like a problem
[58:44.240 --> 58:47.140]  We used to have all the time because I've gotten so used to quick loading screens
[58:47.140 --> 58:51.940]  Yeah, I have that with when I play old games like I'm playing games for the first time
[58:51.940 --> 58:54.320]  I just missed like Dishonored and stuff, but okay
[58:54.320 --> 58:59.840]  My PC is so much better compared to PCs at the time that I can't read any of the tips
[59:00.540 --> 59:01.000]  Yeah
[59:02.520 --> 59:02.980]  Yeah
[59:03.660 --> 59:07.920]  Even modern games that still like I feel like they include that because that's what you do in those screens
[59:07.920 --> 59:13.980]  But like impossible to read they just instantly go away Geoff. I had no idea about your connection with Crash Bandicoot
[59:13.980 --> 59:17.260]  I'd love to did you ever play the remaster they put out like no
[59:17.260 --> 59:21.700]  I don't think I've played Crash Bandicoot since then. Oh my god
[59:21.700 --> 59:26.600]  We need to yeah, I'd love to watch you play some Crash Bandicoot in the remaster and see like yeah
[59:26.600 --> 59:29.840]  Remember and all that I'd love to I remember really enjoying the game
[59:29.840 --> 59:33.660]  I think I think what basically what happened is not too long after that the Dreamcast came out and then
[59:33.660 --> 59:38.560]  Gus and I were Dreamcast boys for a while and then the next box and they were Xbox boys
[59:38.560 --> 59:41.960]  And you know now I'm a trucker and I'm a truck boy. I have a note
[59:41.960 --> 59:46.320]  Okay, but I don't know how I got this information. I don't know where I heard this
[59:47.640 --> 59:48.440]  okay, but
[59:49.940 --> 59:55.280]  Eric did you know that where Geoff was digging or where we were digging the second beanhole?
[59:55.280 --> 59:58.100]  That Geoff pisses there sometimes what?
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:07.000]  I don't think that's true. What?
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:17.040]  How did I write this thing I made up I have definitely peed in my backyard a couple of times
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:22.580]  When like I'm running home from a bike ride and like I don't think I can make it inside, you know
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:29.240]  But I I wouldn't pee right there because I would be visible to my neighbors and to the street
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:34.580]  I pee and I there's like one spot in my backyard where if I really have to go I'll pee like
[01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:36.720]  wedged in between a tree
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:43.880]  Yeah, I never had a pee corner Gavin so like here's the deal with my house though like I
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:47.300]  My the bike goes in the backyard through a long gate and stuff, right?
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:50.080]  And then there's no way for me to get into the back of the house
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.620]  Like there's no key or number pad or anything
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:54.640]  So I gotta go all the way if the doors are locked
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:58.500]  I gotta go all the way back around to the front of the house and let myself in and you know
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:04.380]  What when I was 30 that wouldn't have been a problem, but at 48 it can it's I guess when I gotta go I gotta go
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:08.460]  You've already been on like probably like now a long bike ride
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:12.820]  Yeah that I didn't want to fucking get off my bike to pee and so it's come to an issue
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.260]  Another 25 seconds to get in the front door
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:20.260]  Andrew couldn't wait more than three minutes into the episode to leave and pee
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:25.540]  Yeah, no that was I've never done that in this show my stomach it was listen
[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:30.340]  I share a lot of the issues you have Geoff. I just don't talk about it as much. That was a nuclear scenario
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:32.300]  I'm glad you were late Gavin. You gave me a great out
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:33.500]  I appreciate that quite a bit
[01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:38.620]  Geoff if you got intercepted by a neighbor on the on the backlight on the way back from a bike ride
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:42.540]  It'd be a disaster. It could be yeah, which why I don't talk to my neighbors one time
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:43.360]  You know
[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:48.420]  You know how you were talking about how you you walk in therapy sometimes
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.520]  Well only when my powers off
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.080]  Yeah
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:55.700]  You were you were talking about how somebody stopped you when you were like you were having therapy and somebody's yeah
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:02:01.420]  I was holding my shoe as well. Yeah, you're holding your shoe. I do the same. Well, I did I don't I don't do therapy
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:06.100]  Anymore, but when I was doing it, I would walk and and and talk at the same time. I get like fidgety
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:10.620]  I can't sit still so I have to walk and I would always walk around my neighborhood or like drive to a different neighborhood
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:14.220]  One of the last times I did therapy I had to pee so bad
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:18.760]  I had to stop therapy go into a port-a-potty at a construction site and
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:25.240]  That piss probably cost you ten bucks, it's fine it was worth it
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:27.240]  I
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:32.920]  Was like talking about there was I was like I had a piece of bad news like I just call me back and I was
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:37.180]  Like I'm just in my neighborhood. I was like, oh wait, there's a port-a-potty. I gotta go and I just fucking ran for it
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:41.120]  He and he said he told me he told me it happens more often than you would think
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:45.840]  So, I don't know where I heard that maybe from Emily somewhere
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:50.400]  But you probably heard it from Emily, but I I would did listen. I remember where I pee
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:56.040]  I don't think I've ever peed on that specific spot and I wouldn't because I would be afraid that that would fuck with Emily's seeds
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:02.920]  Ah, that makes sense. So you haven't pissed there since the seeds if I'd ever pissed there before I don't remember it
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:06.800]  But I definitely haven't pissed there since the seeds. There's no danger that you were digging up
[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:09.100]  Okay, I
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:16.020]  It makes sense to me. I had a I had a few pee zones as a kid in my grandparents backyard, but
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:20.740]  You didn't really have a backyard Gavin. So that makes sense to me that
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:29.300]  I had a grandfather who all my dad's side his dad who would only pee outside
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:34.220]  Like he'd be in the living room watching TV and he'd have to take a piss and he'd get up and go out into the backyard
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:38.220]  Is this a normal thing he just I don't know should pee outside
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:45.700]  My logic as a child, I'm like four probably when I was doing this was I'm having so much fun playing outside
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:52.260]  Why would I bother going all the way into the house and using the bathroom when I can just pee in these bushes?
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:56.380]  Why wouldn't I just do that? I had two pee zones. I had one
[01:03:56.380 --> 01:04:00.720]  There's a little bush area on the right corner of the yard and then there was a shed
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:07.780]  Behind like at the very back of the yard and there's a like a PVC pipe that's stuck out of the ground and you know
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:13.120]  When you would like when you cup your hand around your ear, you hear that sort of oceany kind of sound
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.940]  I had convinced myself that that pipe
[01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:22.820]  Led to like the downtown waterfront park area like into the sea and I would pee into the pipe thinking
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:26.020]  I was peeing into the ocean and that I was being very cool
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:30.560]  Those are my pee zones as a kid. Do you have any pee zones now?
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.620]  No, I don't have any pee zones now
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:39.500]  I watch homeless people pee across the street, but I personally don't. Yeah, I know you do. Yeah
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:42.460]  You know that that reminds me a couple years ago
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:46.560]  I we were doing some stuff at Comic Con and I was helping Gus out
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:52.360]  he had to interview a bunch of people from like DC TV shows like
[01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:55.800]  Like I don't remember who but it was you know
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:58.560]  Just like those DC superhero TV shows like Doom Patrol that kind of stuff
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.280]  Titans and
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:05.320]  we were interviewing it was just one of those things where you're like you're sitting in like director's chairs and there's one open and somebody
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:09.780]  Comes and you ask him ten questions. They're all fucking stupid like is a taco a sandwich or whatever
[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:12.100]  it was like that era of the RT podcast and
[01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:15.560]  Some of we got to talking to a dude and somehow we got talking
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.040]  I think he was an actor on Black Lightning
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.920]  I think was the show if I'm if I'm remembered it correctly
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:24.760]  But he was we were talking about peeing outside and he was like dude
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:28.540]  Have you ever pissed out of a second story window and Gus and I were like, why would we do that?
[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:29.900]  And he's like you've got to try it
[01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:34.680]  I'm telling you it's the greatest feeling in the world and he would not stop talking about how great it is to pee out of
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:35.480]  the second floor
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.820]  And so I've never done it, but if
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:43.060]  Maybe a comment leaver has done it. He can let us know
[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:47.000]  So if you ever get a chance, maybe pee out pee out the upstairs window and see what that's like
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.940]  Cuz apparently it's really liberating
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:55.480]  Huh, why can we do that? That guy was on TV. So he probably knows work doesn't really have any upstairs
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.120]  No, I I wonder how high becomes scary
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:06.740]  Like six floors seems even more fun to me, but to pee out of a 20-story window, dude
[01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:09.980]  I think you don't want to go too high because then you're stuck in updrafts
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:12.080]  Yeah, you're gonna go you're gonna be wearing a lot of pee
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.980]  Depends on the window sit up to like, you know
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:19.900]  How there are those windows were like only the bottom half opens up and you swing the handle for it
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:24.320]  Like those I feel like are great P windows regardless of you know
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:27.800]  What they should invent they should invent in tall buildings like in cities like New York
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:32.440]  They should they should invent like little piss doors that you can slide open stick out and pee outside
[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:38.840]  Yeah, like a porthole like a pee hole when I when I was in the army and like when we fly c-130s sometimes
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:43.480]  Which is airplane they literally had like a little like I don't know
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:48.320]  It's like almost like a urinal you'd saddle right up to and you'd like stick your dick in it and then you'd piss out the
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:49.320]  side of the plane essentially
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:53.760]  Huh, so that also count as the most difficult glory hole as well
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:59.220]  I'd be pretty fucking hard because the other side of it is to be like a really fast flying seagull or something
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:04.660]  You don't want to leave your dick out when it's window cleaning day and that's set up. That'd be
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:11.320]  There's something really funny to me about the idea of your balls being caught by the draft just like
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:17.040]  Blown away with a gust of wind especially going like 350 miles an hour outside of a plane
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:24.220]  I think I I think we should try to pee
[01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:25.620]  upstairs
[01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:27.540]  out of something
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:28.760]  Yeah
[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:31.480]  What what do we do we film it?
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:32.640]  No
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:39.940]  I'm just making sure I'm trying to get on the same page here. That's all. I'm just making sure I don't think we should film it
[01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:42.840]  I don't think we should. How can we do it without being seen?
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:46.540]  I don't think this has to be an elaborate thing
[01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:51.000]  I think maybe if somebody just does it let us know if it was more liberating between all of us
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.860]  I just don't really have anywhere I can think of where I'm not in full view
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:59.360]  Maybe I'll buy us a two-story house next time and then in a couple like if I ever buy a new house
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:04.860]  I'll try to get a two-story. What about this? A two-story porta potty. Oh
[01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:07.300]  A porta potty stacked with an upstairs
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:12.080]  What if we just piss off the top of a parking garage I
[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:16.100]  Think we should have
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:22.920]  Two porta potties. Stack them, right? We'll get rid of the actual toilet on the second one. That one goes on top, right?
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:27.680]  Okay
[01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:30.820]  But there isn't one on the top
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:35.580]  It's just a hole straight through and you just piss from upstairs down into the toilet
[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:39.940]  Oh like a long-distance piss, but you still have to aim it. That's what I was talking about
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:47.720]  I brought that up along the lifeguard. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Same type of idea. You're right. Get some distance
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:55.260]  But for me, it was fear of toilet snakes. This is just for pleasure. So you don't know why you think I pee there
[01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:58.160]  I just don't know. I just didn't remember how I got the info
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.800]  It just says that you piss there after a bike ride
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:08.660]  It feels like there's a mole in the house and that mole is a little incorrect mole as well
[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:11.720]  Or does it just feel like Gavin is writing stuff?
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:20.300]  No, I think I think he must have talked to Emily or something but maybe it was a Halloween. Oh
[01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:26.360]  Maybe it was a Halloween where that kid almost got gizmoed cuz I could just oh, I'm looking at my notes right now
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:33.220]  We almost watch a kid getting engulfed in flames. Oh my god. That's what what happened burn dogs saved his life
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:36.500]  Really, you know those like blow up
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:42.500]  You know those like blow up air suits that people put on that's like a dinosaur they walk around well we had
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:46.940]  First off, you know, there's like a Halloween parade in my neighborhood
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:52.580]  And so we had Gavin Meg and Bernie and Vanessa over and we invited Eric and his small wife
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:54.320]  they weren't able to make it and
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.080]  we set up on the front and the
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.680]  driveway and I got the chiminea out and we
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:02.400]  Because it was cold and we made a little fire and then we were sitting out in lawn chairs
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:05.260]  Just like saying hi to people and waving and then when they would want candy
[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:11.180]  We'd point to where the candy was which was far away from us and some fucking kid walked right up to the chiminea thinking there was
[01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:14.180]  Candy in it and got real close to it. And he was like all blown up
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:16.100]  he was a gizmo like from gremlins and
[01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:19.840]  He was like he like with the hug it almost and burned I got to grab him and push
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:25.160]  I think he just couldn't see it. Oh my god. That what it was. Yeah, just about to walk straight into it
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:29.740]  He just he seemed like he was coming straight for it. And this is where where I realized
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:31.300]  that
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.540]  Burn dog and I took different approaches to it
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:41.660]  He took a very preemptive strike in basically tackling the kid away from the from the fire
[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:48.020]  And I just froze I I was just watching it happen and I was making a plan. I was like, okay
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:51.060]  Well, this kids about to catch on fire. I started looking around
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:58.860]  But I just couldn't I couldn't get anything done I just felt like I'm gonna go into action when it happens
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.880]  And I didn't think for a second
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:06.300]  Get up and prevent it from happening and I just don't know why I didn't go to you were waiting for the problem so that
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:07.020]  You could solve it
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:11.540]  There was no problem to solve yet. I'm I think it's just in my nature
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:16.600]  I just that I don't want to I don't want to make a scene unless the scene is guaranteed to happen
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:20.560]  Eric said I like calling it getting gizmoed. What would that be getting gizmoed?
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:26.220]  It sounds getting melted into your costume. I guess I guess so. Yeah
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:31.500]  Gavin explained it to me as getting gizmoed when he told me this story a while ago
[01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:34.700]  Getting gizmoed
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:38.180]  Have you ever caught on fire while wearing something
[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:40.120]  Yeah
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:44.800]  Caught on fire caught on intentionally
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:50.980]  Unintentionally. Oh, no. No, I've been put on fire for like shoots and stuff
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:56.700]  Have you ever caught on fire Andrew? I have once it was uneventful
[01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:00.000]  It was about as uneventful as a fire setting as you could have but I was wearing
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.220]  We're getting ready to go to our soccer game and I was sitting in front of the fireplace
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:08.160]  Getting all nice and toasty and I lit the back of my jersey on fire
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:15.480]  And I didn't I didn't notice until there was a giant cloud of smoke behind me and everybody in front of me was freaking out
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:20.760]  And so then I had to play with a hole in the back of my jersey for that game because there wasn't enough time
[01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:22.020]  to get a replacement.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:28.060]  I didn't get burned in or anything, but uh
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:32.960]  Minor fire. I definitely used to set people on fire a lot
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:36.600]  Now that we're having this conversation. I'm starting to think back
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.160]  Set people on fire?
[01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:48.540]  Definitely used to like anytime anybody read a newspaper in front of me that newspaper was getting that newspaper was getting lit
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.180]  You would just pull out a lighter and do it?
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:57.240]  Yeah, you just like light the bottom of the newspaper in the middle where they're reading and then suddenly it all fucking catches on fire
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:00.560]  But those things go up fast. Yeah, they do. Yeah. Yeah, they do
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:06.440]  This adds a whole new layer of context to your story about the subway guy
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:12.400]  Like covering himself in soda. He's just worried about you setting him on fire. He's making sure he wasn't lightable
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:15.280]  That's entirely possible. He knew. I uh, yeah
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.300]  I uh, I used to set people's shoes on fire a lot
[01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:22.780]  Jesus Christ. I'm learning that I got off easy in the time I've known Geoff
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:25.640]  Have I never set you on fire?
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:27.640]  I think you have
[01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:33.020]  Tried with a lighter on my shoes. That does sound familiar, but I don't think it went. It didn't take
[01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:36.420]  I was about to say, I'm pretty sure I was still doing that when we were friends. Yeah, you're right
[01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:38.580]  I don't know why I would forget you trying to burn me
[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:44.500]  I definitely slowed down but in what I was like, I would say from like 18 to like 28
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:49.680]  Do do not do not have paper around me and not be paying attention
[01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:52.400]  We did that immersion
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:58.640]  Video where was it NBA Jam where the ball catches on fire? Yeah, so they would they wrapped
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:05.640]  It looked like shoelaces were like dipped in sticky napalm-ish material like or like rubber cement or something
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:10.500]  Very flammable and those were tied around the ball and it would catch the ball like nice and evenly on fire
[01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:11.400]  but eventually the
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:17.480]  String would just snap and on one of the takes it snapped flew off and wrapped around my head and
[01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:22.140]  Stuck to me like a flammable glue around the back of my head. They had to
[01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:25.880]  Well initially they had to punch me in the head a lot until the flame
[01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:33.060]  Jack and I have to do that too. I don't know. I don't we did it for like one second
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:38.500]  I remember thinking this is so dumb Gavin and Michael already did this. Why do I why do I have to get set on fire?
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:45.680]  I don't remember. I remember not liking that like not having fun doing that at all. Oh, I had fun
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:52.680]  I did not I think I think I was pretty I think I was probably pretty I was probably like in a bad way
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:55.100]  You're probably live-action doubt a little bit
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:15:01.080]  Yeah, I think I was probably I was at my drunkest and like most unhealthy to probably I was having to play sports
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:05.020]  I don't know who I could source this to but my notes say you had a great time
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:06.800]  It was actually one of your favorite shoots
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.960]  Who would have said this but because I wrote it it must be true
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:18.080]  You must be that wrong little mole again a little pesky mole just leaking stuff about you Geoff
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:21.420]  You got a hand on the basketball. I
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:26.300]  Got a note that says Gavin has been snorting mustard for pleasure. I don't know who told me this or
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:30.320]  Why but I guess it's you want to talk about that Gavin?
[01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:33.160]  Yeah, tell me about it
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:35.540]  Well, no, I mean you're the one that did it and first of all
[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:41.260]  It's a lie because all you consume is protein cubes and that's true. It's true that it's once a day once a day
[01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:43.060]  He likes to excite his nose with hot mustard
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:47.960]  What's uh, I you know, I said I didn't have any notes, but I do have I do have a note here
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:53.040]  That says hot dog blowgun. Oh, yeah, that was from last time. Do we talk about that?
[01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:57.640]  Yeah. Oh, yeah you getting a hot dog launched at you trying to catch it and like we went deep on
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.120]  Yeah, we're gonna fire when I have a stage four
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:03.920]  I think that was less a note for talking about and more a note to remember to do so build
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:07.580]  I think I think I want to build a hot dog blowgun. Yeah, that's that's cool
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:10.880]  I like that. You wrote the note so you can remember what it was. Don't remember what it was
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:17.620]  Yeah, but I'm not I wasn't expecting to have to know like at some point when I sat down on my notes
[01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:19.540]  I'd look at it and I go. Oh and I go back and listen the episode
[01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:24.080]  This is just because we're recording so fast in advance. So those those are lost episodes to me right now
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:30.140]  They don't exist until they're published. Yeah, are you gonna you gonna get that going Eric? Yeah hot dog blowgun over stage four
[01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:36.120]  Oh, there was a there was a whole spoon thing you and I wanted to do Andrew, oh, I forgot about the spoons
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:43.540]  Yeah, I got shit next time. Yeah again a spoon cliffhanger spoon a double spoon cliffhanger, man
[01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:49.120]  It's really gonna be a letdown. It's such a letdown already. Yeah, it's not it was just it was yeah
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:50.020]  It was a small thing
[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:55.540]  But but the movie cliffhanger was also a letdown and if there's one thing that shouldn't be a letdown
[01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:59.160]  It's cliffhanger. So it's okay was the movie cliffhanger a letdown
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:04.920]  I feel like it wasn't well-loved. I haven't seen it. So I don't know. I don't have a personal opinion
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:07.440]  I remember when it came out thinking it was awesome
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:15.340]  Really? Yeah, there was yeah, we have a total misread on that. But you may not I just I remember liking every
[01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:21.160]  Sylvester Stallone movie I see like I grew up with Sylvester Stallone. So anything he did was cool to me
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:25.720]  I I have no idea if it holds up or not, but I do remember thinking it was fucking awesome at the time
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:32.720]  I remember it happening in Ace Ventura. What what happened? Yeah, that's that's what when I think of cliffhanger, I think of the same thing, Gavin
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:39.040]  I haven't seen those movies either. If I see the parody before that it's like the whole if I have a dog with a human name
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:42.000]  Wow, that's I'm totally on your side
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:46.160]  You dude Wow, we went the whole episode you brought it all the way back around
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:50.520]  I'm 100% on the same side when I think of cliffhanger, I think of the parody first. That's so funny
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:55.580]  Wow, when I think of cliffhanger, I think this is happening in my universe. I could be there
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:58.160]  You could be a cliffhanger. I could be dangly
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.380]  All right, that's enough
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:06.140]  Right
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:09.880]  While back
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:15.200]  We should flush it though. I had a good time. I had a wonderful time. Oh, no, I don't want to flush it
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:20.540]  You got real weird there for a little while Gavin. I don't think anybody wants to lose that. Maybe we should flush it
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:26.280]  Oh, yeah, we got we got Gavin not wanting his mouth to be excited free for
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:33.900]  Just not three times a day. Oh
[01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:34.920]  Is that the parody from
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:42.780]  It's the only thing that I remember is the raccoon falling that's that's got to be the sequel, right?
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.360]  That's why I fucking hated that movie the one you hate although I'd stand by him coming out of the
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:55.300]  The rhino's anus one of the best things that ever happened on film. Yeah, I hate that. I viscerally hate that scene
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:59.420]  I hate wouldn't it be fun to rebuild it and have Gavin come out of a rhino's anus
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:03.460]  Let's just first get anus waxed
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:11.100]  Well, there's an order and anus gags after our anuses are all smoothly waxed we'll be primed to
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:12.420]  Yeah
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:16.040]  It's no better time
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:23.960]  Has anyone ever for Halloween dressed up as a rhino with a tiny Ace Ventura figurine coming out of their ass hole
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:27.140]  Let's look Ace Ventura
[01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:31.140]  Rhino Halloween, it'd be a great two-part costume, you know
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:36.020]  I like people do the front end and back end of a horse, but it's just like one person just runs out
[01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:37.100]  Is there part of the gag?
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:46.020]  That definitely I think that counts oh, yeah, I mean that's definitely intentional one, right
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:52.740]  Somebody doing in this costume. Yep. Yeah, that's great. That works. Well, you go get married Geoff. You have fun with that
[01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:55.460]  Oh, I will have already worried by the time this happens
[01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:58.920]  Yeah, we're taking a little break because you got to go get married and all that stuff
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:03.160]  All right. Well, why do you sound sour about it? No, I'm just saying he's getting married
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:11.060]  So we're gonna take a break. I don't like the way he says it either. That's weird. Geoff is getting a married to

[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:30.960]  Over this next weekend. I don't know. I don't know. What do you want? How do you want it to sound?
