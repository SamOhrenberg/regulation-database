[00:10.430 --> 00:14.090]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:14.410 --> 00:16.610]  This is episode 191.
[00:16.750 --> 00:21.050]  My name is Geoff Ramsey and with me, as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[00:21.150 --> 00:21.330]  Hello.
[00:22.170 --> 00:25.790]  I can't believe I'm alive and here and happy and not dying.
[00:26.050 --> 00:28.410]  Unlike last time. You made it.
[00:28.430 --> 00:30.230]  I made it. It was great.
[00:30.370 --> 00:31.610]  It was terrible. It was great.
[00:31.930 --> 00:35.030]  Today has been an interesting day of content.
[00:35.490 --> 00:38.030]  We filmed the end of last week's podcast.
[00:38.590 --> 00:41.810]  Then we filmed the end of the first round of a trivia contest.
[00:42.210 --> 00:44.990]  Then we filmed the second round of a trivia contest.
[00:45.230 --> 00:46.770]  And now we're filming a whole other podcast.
[00:46.990 --> 00:49.550]  I feel like I just hit a new low. Really?
[00:50.770 --> 00:55.050]  I feel like you hit a low in worms recently that I had never seen before.
[00:55.170 --> 00:57.050]  How could you be lower than that?
[00:57.350 --> 01:00.130]  I was just brushing my teeth and I...
[01:00.130 --> 01:03.670]  The toothpaste missed my toothbrush and landed on my gut.
[01:05.570 --> 01:09.730]  And I just smeared the toothbrush in it and I just kept going.
[01:10.270 --> 01:14.810]  No, Gavin! That's a new low. You have hit a new low. You're not kidding.
[01:15.530 --> 01:18.630]  There would have been a time where I would have just wiped that off and got new toothpaste.
[01:19.470 --> 01:21.230]  But then I just thought, who am I trying to impress here?
[01:21.410 --> 01:23.330]  That time should have been 20 minutes ago.
[01:24.370 --> 01:26.850]  I think that's perfectly valid.
[01:27.630 --> 01:28.870]  What, are you going to waste the toothpaste?
[01:29.710 --> 01:31.710]  Yeah, I mean, it's toothpaste.
[01:32.370 --> 01:34.170]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:34.270 --> 01:38.150]  I feel what's weird to me is not necessarily reusing it, but in my head,
[01:38.250 --> 01:41.790]  you're smearing it all over your clothes, trying to get it on like it's spreading.
[01:42.190 --> 01:45.130]  Like if you would have said you swabbed it with your finger, then put it on,
[01:45.150 --> 01:46.250]  that would have been less weird.
[01:46.710 --> 01:50.070]  And I think it was weird that I went with the toothbrush to my own gut.
[01:50.250 --> 01:53.110]  Yeah, that's what kind of I think weird to be out about it.
[01:53.310 --> 01:55.370]  That just seems like the most direct way to do it.
[01:55.710 --> 01:57.450]  Can I ask how you how you
[01:59.130 --> 02:01.150]  missed? I don't understand how you missed.
[02:01.330 --> 02:02.970]  I don't understand how you missed, I guess.
[02:03.430 --> 02:04.510]  You missed the toothbrush.
[02:05.130 --> 02:06.350]  Yeah, what angle was the tube?
[02:07.210 --> 02:12.570]  Well, I had the the thing that got me is that I untwisted the toothpaste
[02:12.570 --> 02:14.770]  lid with the same hand I was holding the tube with.
[02:14.850 --> 02:17.250]  So I was already sort of like smashed up against myself.
[02:17.270 --> 02:19.690]  And the other hand had the the toothbrush in.
[02:20.070 --> 02:22.950]  And it just it just missed the brush and bounced onto my shirt.
[02:23.190 --> 02:25.530]  Is the toothpaste cap doing anything for you?
[02:25.730 --> 02:26.950]  Well, it's keeping the toothpaste.
[02:26.950 --> 02:29.430]  Or do you think eliminating the toothpaste cap
[02:29.430 --> 02:32.770]  maybe like eliminates this issue for forever for you?
[02:32.890 --> 02:33.790]  Just like leave it off.
[02:34.370 --> 02:36.170]  Yeah. No, that's crazy.
[02:36.330 --> 02:38.690]  Go hard. The toothpaste will go hard.
[02:38.930 --> 02:40.530]  Isn't that why the cap's there to keep it moist?
[02:40.570 --> 02:42.010]  You got to put the cap on. Yeah, yeah.
[02:42.410 --> 02:44.350]  I don't think it'll go. I don't think it'll.
[02:44.350 --> 02:46.290]  I don't think it'll get stale.
[02:46.570 --> 02:48.010]  It'll get like crusty and stale.
[02:48.010 --> 02:49.250]  Yeah, I don't I don't trust that.
[02:49.350 --> 02:50.250]  They'll be like a film.
[02:50.370 --> 02:51.250]  It'll be like a skin.
[02:51.390 --> 02:52.650]  Like when you leave soup on.
[02:52.650 --> 02:54.050]  I don't think that's true.
[02:54.510 --> 02:56.170]  You're using it every day.
[02:56.170 --> 02:57.410]  It's not long.
[02:57.550 --> 02:59.570]  It's not sitting there long enough to go bad.
[02:59.690 --> 03:02.950]  Is it like a regional thing or an old time thing where the toothpaste
[03:02.950 --> 03:07.570]  used to be in like upright cylinders and you would press the pump on the top?
[03:07.710 --> 03:09.730]  Oh, no, the pump. I don't know what you're talking about.
[03:09.830 --> 03:11.110]  The pump sounds crazy.
[03:11.450 --> 03:13.350]  The pump was a thing in the 90s.
[03:13.870 --> 03:15.750]  It was like a new way to do it.
[03:15.790 --> 03:19.190]  But they before that, they had essentially what we have now.
[03:19.210 --> 03:23.810]  But you would have the old metal key that you would wind the to wind it back with.
[03:23.870 --> 03:24.470]  You remember those?
[03:24.470 --> 03:26.710]  No, but I used the little pump things.
[03:26.790 --> 03:28.930]  And if ever you would leave one of those for too long
[03:28.930 --> 03:31.670]  and then go to use it again, the top of the toothpaste
[03:31.670 --> 03:34.890]  that was in the little primer area would have gone hard
[03:34.890 --> 03:35.830]  and you would have to pump.
[03:36.190 --> 03:38.910]  And sometimes it would shoot the hard toothpaste out.
[03:40.210 --> 03:41.750]  So that's why I think it would go hard.
[03:42.210 --> 03:43.830]  I've never experienced that with toothpaste.
[03:43.970 --> 03:46.190]  That's definitely like a hand soap type thing.
[03:46.270 --> 03:47.110]  Happens all the time.
[03:47.750 --> 03:49.610]  Solidifies and it's shooting all over the place.
[03:49.690 --> 03:50.110]  It's a mess.
[03:50.890 --> 03:53.110]  I just don't I don't foresee it.
[03:53.110 --> 03:54.510]  I don't foresee it happening with toothpaste.
[03:55.050 --> 03:56.010]  What do you mean you don't foresee it?
[03:56.010 --> 03:57.630]  What the fuck is that, Geoff?
[03:57.970 --> 03:59.510]  That's the key. I know what Geoff's talking about.
[04:00.070 --> 04:04.150]  That's exactly how like every home in America had one of those keys when I was a kid.
[04:04.490 --> 04:04.670]  Yeah.
[04:05.270 --> 04:09.050]  And so you could squeeze every bit of fucking toothpaste out of a toothpaste tube.
[04:09.710 --> 04:10.450]  That's amazing.
[04:10.970 --> 04:14.090]  Yeah. I don't see them anymore, but that's what that's the way it used to work.
[04:14.910 --> 04:16.370]  And then that's what they replaced it with.
[04:16.470 --> 04:16.570]  Yeah.
[04:16.710 --> 04:21.550]  Like even like Coke cans or soda cans had like separate things at one point.
[04:21.550 --> 04:23.070]  Like the bit you pull comes off.
[04:23.830 --> 04:26.990]  Yeah. Those are the pump things that used to shoot a jet of hard toothpaste out.
[04:27.410 --> 04:30.270]  It looks like bear mace, but for cavities.
[04:32.270 --> 04:34.510]  Well, that's kind of what toothpaste is, right?
[04:34.970 --> 04:36.590]  Right. I just want the spray.
[04:36.730 --> 04:38.250]  I want to mace myself in the face.
[04:38.430 --> 04:42.450]  I want to be like one of those guys in Mad Max Fury Road with the silver spray paint.
[04:42.510 --> 04:43.570]  But I want that for cavities.
[04:44.050 --> 04:46.790]  Ultimate tip for these pumps, too, is that as they were running low,
[04:46.990 --> 04:50.090]  the top red piece wouldn't pump any toothpaste out.
[04:50.090 --> 04:53.410]  But if you took the handle of your toothbrush and shoved it up the bottom,
[04:53.730 --> 04:55.330]  you could eek out a little bit more toothpaste.
[04:57.990 --> 05:05.350]  Hey, if if it helps, Gav, I recently experienced a new low as well.
[05:05.650 --> 05:09.490]  Maybe maybe I can I can soften the blow of your new low a little bit.
[05:09.570 --> 05:12.090]  Oh, yeah. I shit myself in the shower the other day.
[05:13.810 --> 05:17.690]  Come on. I don't know why I don't expect it, but it's always shit with you.
[05:17.690 --> 05:20.390]  Yeah, never, never had that happen.
[05:20.650 --> 05:22.110]  You're in the same boat as me now.
[05:22.590 --> 05:26.830]  Got in the shower, went to fart and couldn't trust that fart.
[05:27.250 --> 05:29.690]  And then I had to hold my cheeks together with my hands
[05:29.690 --> 05:34.910]  and slip across the floor to the toilet, where I then exploded in the toilet.
[05:35.350 --> 05:39.430]  And I have to say, when I pulled my hand away after wiping,
[05:39.710 --> 05:42.210]  there was I managed to get poop on every finger.
[05:42.550 --> 05:46.290]  I'm tired. It was the messiest cleanup I've ever had.
[05:46.290 --> 05:51.490]  I don't want to hear it was the most heinous thing I've ever dealt with in my life.
[05:51.850 --> 05:55.030]  God, but if you were pushing your cheeks shut, how did it get on your hands?
[05:55.350 --> 05:57.870]  It just because I had to like wipe after I finished pooping.
[05:57.930 --> 05:59.830]  I sat down. I had to let it all out.
[05:59.970 --> 06:03.870]  I had exploders and which, by the way, I just now I'm at a point
[06:03.870 --> 06:05.450]  I've decided I was talking about the dimly the night.
[06:05.650 --> 06:09.670]  I'm just going to assume if I have to fart that it's a shit from here on out.
[06:09.690 --> 06:11.410]  I'm going to do all my farts on the toilet.
[06:11.550 --> 06:14.830]  So did any come out of your bum onto the shower floor?
[06:15.390 --> 06:16.550]  No, it was all content.
[06:16.690 --> 06:18.530]  That hasn't happened yet. I did contain it.
[06:18.610 --> 06:20.270]  However, I do have a puppy.
[06:20.730 --> 06:23.230]  So I have just discovered shit everywhere all the time now.
[06:23.730 --> 06:24.590]  Yeah. Oh, man.
[06:25.350 --> 06:28.030]  Just just all the time, just on me all the time.
[06:28.090 --> 06:29.410]  Like, why is there shit on my elbow?
[06:29.610 --> 06:30.450]  Where did that come from?
[06:30.950 --> 06:32.610]  No idea. Can't track it down.
[06:32.730 --> 06:35.790]  Just there. Shit on my elbow.
[06:37.650 --> 06:40.630]  You know, the classic expression shit on my elbow.
[06:41.530 --> 06:46.170]  Hey, do you remember how we had an ice storm like two days ago?
[06:46.430 --> 06:48.270]  Or it really wasn't even the ice, except that Eric's house.
[06:48.470 --> 06:49.430]  Eric had ice. Nobody else did.
[06:50.090 --> 06:53.690]  Yeah, I went out in the backyard to take the dog out earlier, and it was so hot.
[06:53.830 --> 06:56.430]  I took my shirt off and went for a little tan for 15 minutes.
[06:56.690 --> 06:58.410]  Are you serious? Fucking wild, dude.
[06:58.450 --> 07:03.610]  We had a 30 degree swing in Celsius in like a day.
[07:03.870 --> 07:06.010]  Oh, my God. I got too hot.
[07:06.070 --> 07:07.590]  I had to go in after a while.
[07:08.630 --> 07:11.510]  It went from like minus nine to 21.
[07:12.210 --> 07:16.250]  I still had icicles in my front yard this morning where I was dripping my faucet.
[07:16.470 --> 07:19.090]  And then in the afternoon, I went for a sun, a sun in the backyard.
[07:19.350 --> 07:20.250]  It's just fucking ridiculous.
[07:20.690 --> 07:22.010]  Did a branch hit you in the face?
[07:23.010 --> 07:26.350]  No, I got all my branches cut back after you told your story.
[07:29.930 --> 07:32.590]  I'm kind of sad to hear that because it's snowing here right now,
[07:32.610 --> 07:33.870]  and I thought that like, oh, look at us.
[07:33.890 --> 07:35.990]  It's so rare that our weather is aligned.
[07:35.990 --> 07:38.090]  But not even today.
[07:38.410 --> 07:40.730]  Don't don't don't worry, it will be tomorrow.
[07:40.730 --> 07:43.470]  The day I was going to flip out, it's yeah, it's seven.
[07:43.550 --> 07:45.470]  It's like 72 today. Tomorrow will be like 40.
[07:46.370 --> 07:49.730]  See, I can't picture that because essentially every time I've been to Texas
[07:49.730 --> 07:51.830]  is RTX, which is in July.
[07:52.070 --> 07:53.850]  Typically, it's like peak summer.
[07:54.110 --> 07:58.030]  I can't imagine a cool Austin that is just hard to process.
[07:58.350 --> 07:59.430]  You should have a win to visit.
[08:00.690 --> 08:01.930]  I don't. Yeah, I should.
[08:02.150 --> 08:03.850]  I don't I'm trying to think like the closest.
[08:04.430 --> 08:05.990]  It's such a confusing place, man.
[08:06.930 --> 08:08.250]  Well, otherwise, yeah, it seems like a nightmare.
[08:08.650 --> 08:11.950]  I went out today and I thought to myself as I was standing t shirtless
[08:11.950 --> 08:14.550]  in the backyard soaking up the sun, I thought to myself,
[08:14.630 --> 08:16.030]  why the fuck would I ever leave?
[08:17.110 --> 08:19.570]  But tomorrow I'll be like, I get the fuck out of here.
[08:21.690 --> 08:25.970]  Speaking of confusing, I have a question for you guys about movie posters.
[08:27.130 --> 08:30.730]  I was looking at I was reviewing, I was just looking at like old movies and stuff.
[08:30.870 --> 08:32.610]  And funny enough, this summer 98 movie.
[08:33.110 --> 08:36.610]  Have you what's the worst movie poster you've seen?
[08:36.850 --> 08:41.350]  Is there anything that come to mind in the sense of like fails to explain?
[08:41.670 --> 08:45.950]  Like it's just a terrible visual representation of what that story is.
[08:46.890 --> 08:49.490]  Mine is six days, seven nights.
[08:49.670 --> 08:51.610]  I don't know if you've seen that poster or that movie.
[08:52.010 --> 08:56.570]  No, I I watched it as part of when we did the summer 98 stuff
[08:57.070 --> 09:00.770]  and I'd seen the poster forever, but knew nothing about the movie.
[09:00.770 --> 09:02.170]  And that's the poster.
[09:02.590 --> 09:08.630]  I had always assumed that this is like a kind of horror thriller set in the jungle.
[09:09.590 --> 09:12.650]  And as the pop music played in the opening scene and said,
[09:12.790 --> 09:16.910]  like, I think it's an Ivan Reitman movie like this tonally is not what I thought.
[09:17.030 --> 09:19.450]  Nothing about that reads as romantic comedy.
[09:19.670 --> 09:22.470]  I think that's the worst romantic comedy poster I've ever seen.
[09:22.470 --> 09:25.050]  That's a romantic comedy. He's wearing that is shorts.
[09:25.430 --> 09:26.530]  That is a romantic.
[09:26.530 --> 09:32.870]  I mean, they get they crash on an island shorts and Danny Trejo dies later.
[09:32.950 --> 09:34.790]  There's like one scene that's kind of intense,
[09:34.790 --> 09:38.710]  but it is largely a very fluffy, romantic comedy.
[09:40.710 --> 09:42.590]  Oh, that is a very misleading poster.
[09:42.930 --> 09:45.430]  How about this one? Oh, God.
[09:45.810 --> 09:46.390]  What's yours?
[09:48.630 --> 09:52.830]  I mean, it does a great job of describing it's I mean, you get it right away.
[09:53.010 --> 09:54.550]  It's I don't think I get it from that poster.
[09:54.810 --> 09:56.390]  I'm not exactly sure what's going on there.
[09:56.390 --> 09:59.130]  But I didn't expect there to be a needle in thread or, you know, there is.
[10:00.090 --> 10:01.070]  It's pretty gross.
[10:01.550 --> 10:02.830]  Can I share mine?
[10:03.110 --> 10:06.490]  I'm of course, I feel pretty I feel pretty strong about this one.
[10:07.090 --> 10:11.010]  God, the shaggy dog starring Tim Allen is
[10:11.890 --> 10:14.890]  that is the craziest fucking poster,
[10:14.950 --> 10:18.850]  because when you look at the human eyes, it's got Tim Allen's eyes.
[10:18.950 --> 10:20.270]  Yes. Yeah. Here's the thing.
[10:20.470 --> 10:23.770]  That's the one that came out, you know, like in like the 2000s
[10:23.770 --> 10:24.890]  or whatever the fuck it came out.
[10:24.890 --> 10:26.810]  The original poster is good.
[10:27.010 --> 10:30.390]  The original poster is a dog wearing like this college stuff.
[10:30.410 --> 10:31.730]  And he says, I was a teenage boy.
[10:31.730 --> 10:33.930]  And it's it's horror. It's funny.
[10:34.070 --> 10:36.570]  And you'll love the shaggy, the shaggiest dog.
[10:36.790 --> 10:40.630]  Like there's it's zany and madcap and it's describing stuff and whatever.
[10:41.010 --> 10:43.890]  And then you look at the one where they just put Tim Allen's eyes on a dog
[10:43.890 --> 10:46.070]  and you go, what happened here?
[10:46.470 --> 10:47.350]  Why is this?
[10:47.510 --> 10:50.650]  Wasn't there a sequel to that movie called the Shaggy D.A.?
[10:51.730 --> 10:54.010]  The Shaggy? I've never heard of the Shaggy D.A.
[10:54.010 --> 10:55.590]  Oh, my God. Here, hold on a second.
[10:55.790 --> 10:56.130]  Hold on a second.
[10:57.410 --> 11:00.790]  One poster that was way more literal than I was expecting was this one.
[11:01.470 --> 11:03.630]  Oh, yeah. That's a great John Malkovich.
[11:03.930 --> 11:05.810]  Yeah, that's the sequel to it.
[11:05.830 --> 11:07.770]  Oh, my God. The Shaggy D.A.
[11:07.990 --> 11:10.730]  But do you see how they didn't give him human eyes?
[11:11.190 --> 11:12.750]  Yeah, no, he's definitely got dog eyes.
[11:12.950 --> 11:14.010]  He's got human glasses, though.
[11:14.390 --> 11:15.570]  He does. And that's fun.
[11:16.050 --> 11:16.710]  I'm way into that.
[11:18.630 --> 11:21.630]  What is human eyes on an animal is just wrong.
[11:21.630 --> 11:25.350]  It is. I wonder what the worst animal eyes to replace.
[11:25.490 --> 11:28.010]  I think goat eyes on a human would be the scariest.
[11:28.250 --> 11:30.370]  Whoa. Oh, my God.
[11:30.490 --> 11:32.870]  Have you ever seen the goat rectangle eye?
[11:33.190 --> 11:36.190]  No. Yeah, I think shark eyes would be scary.
[11:36.990 --> 11:37.750]  They look crazy.
[11:37.750 --> 11:39.270]  And they're big and bulbous.
[11:39.710 --> 11:42.390]  I why did I why was I able to find this?
[11:42.710 --> 11:44.170]  What is that? Oh, God.
[11:44.850 --> 11:46.770]  It's goat eyes on people.
[11:46.890 --> 11:47.650]  I found it.
[11:47.910 --> 11:49.870]  Jesus Christ, that's horrifying.
[11:49.870 --> 11:51.430]  Oh, I hate it.
[11:51.450 --> 11:53.370]  Stop. I hate it so much.
[11:53.690 --> 11:56.730]  I found so many.
[11:57.390 --> 11:58.790]  What's going on?
[11:59.390 --> 12:01.150]  I found so many.
[12:01.730 --> 12:04.370]  Oh, it should look like that.
[12:06.190 --> 12:06.850]  Oh, my God.
[12:07.090 --> 12:08.650]  It's doesn't really look any different.
[12:11.490 --> 12:12.130]  Wow.
[12:14.670 --> 12:17.410]  Oh, they swapped. It's an eye swap.
[12:17.930 --> 12:18.690]  Oh, that's terrible.
[12:18.690 --> 12:20.570]  No one. We should all just keep our eyes.
[12:21.150 --> 12:23.890]  No, I think human eyes on a cat actually looks really good.
[12:23.950 --> 12:25.370]  I think that's an upgrade for the cat.
[12:25.770 --> 12:27.270]  Now I'm just thinking of Judge Doom.
[12:30.050 --> 12:34.610]  Oh, man, goat eyes are crazy with like their rectangles or whatever.
[12:34.730 --> 12:37.470]  Like they look like you can you can look at it and be like, oh, yeah,
[12:37.470 --> 12:39.210]  this thing's like connected to Satan somehow.
[12:39.510 --> 12:42.370]  Like I guess this was this was an episode of Batman Beyond.
[12:42.530 --> 12:46.950]  I remember where humans were getting like goat eyes and cat ears and stuff
[12:46.950 --> 12:48.310]  and modifications somehow.
[12:48.670 --> 12:50.370]  Somehow Batman had to stop it.
[12:50.830 --> 12:54.530]  Gavin, that scared me so bad as a kid.
[12:54.810 --> 12:58.010]  Gavin just posted a picture from Judge Doom.
[12:58.210 --> 12:59.870]  Roger, who framed Roger Rabbit.
[13:00.110 --> 13:03.270]  And it is it's as a kid, terrified.
[13:03.610 --> 13:05.630]  I got scared later in life.
[13:05.670 --> 13:09.010]  I've told this before, I think, but the version of Roger Rabbit
[13:09.010 --> 13:12.190]  that I watched like 25 times was recorded from TV.
[13:12.990 --> 13:15.910]  And all of the stuff with his eyes popping out of his head was cut out.
[13:15.910 --> 13:20.170]  So when I finally saw the full movie on like someone's actual proper VHS
[13:20.790 --> 13:23.670]  and he starts talking in a really squealy, high pitched voice
[13:23.670 --> 13:27.130]  with his eyes popping out, I had to like get up and like run out of the room.
[13:30.910 --> 13:33.190]  Terrified. Oh, man.
[13:34.170 --> 13:37.530]  This is a great source of content for this.
[13:37.650 --> 13:38.250]  Animorphs covers.
[13:38.710 --> 13:41.850]  I'm just looking at Animorphs covers of books because it's the fucking
[13:41.850 --> 13:44.350]  the animal transitions. It's great.
[13:44.350 --> 13:47.630]  It's ridiculous. I'm glad I was too old for Animorphs.
[13:48.410 --> 13:50.330]  Yeah. You didn't miss out. Yeah.
[13:51.130 --> 13:54.150]  I would I'd be afraid that I would have liked it too much in a weird way.
[13:54.650 --> 13:56.550]  You know what I mean? I wouldn't want to go down that road.
[13:56.690 --> 13:58.410]  I don't know. What are you saying?
[13:58.570 --> 14:00.710]  Like I might have just been I could have been too cool to me.
[14:00.790 --> 14:02.430]  I don't know. I don't want to get too into animals.
[14:02.930 --> 14:06.390]  Nothing is scarier than the third iteration of an Animorphs cover.
[14:07.690 --> 14:09.330]  Oh, hey, here you go.
[14:10.770 --> 14:12.570]  No! A starfish?
[14:13.030 --> 14:13.990]  Oh, that's a nightmare.
[14:14.450 --> 14:16.550]  I think they made a show of Animorphs too, right?
[14:16.670 --> 14:18.790]  So if you want to, yeah, you didn't need to read the books.
[14:18.870 --> 14:19.610]  You could operate it.
[14:20.650 --> 14:22.990]  I I recently I got it.
[14:23.090 --> 14:26.690]  I recently made a what's turned out to be a pretty major life change
[14:27.090 --> 14:28.430]  that I wanted to share with you guys.
[14:28.890 --> 14:30.030]  Oh, yeah. I wasn't anticipating.
[14:30.970 --> 14:31.890]  I have started.
[14:32.310 --> 14:35.810]  I got to be I I never thought at 48 years old I would do this.
[14:35.890 --> 14:37.810]  I would get into this and then I would take it.
[14:37.990 --> 14:41.090]  So I don't get into it so swiftly, but I started
[14:41.090 --> 14:42.630]  not too long after Christmas.
[14:42.830 --> 14:45.630]  I haven't told you guys this, but I started streaming
[14:46.490 --> 14:50.430]  and I've been really I got really into it and I got Emily into it.
[14:50.530 --> 14:51.310]  Emily's been streaming.
[14:51.530 --> 14:53.270]  Millie streams a little bit, but she's already streaming.
[14:54.410 --> 14:58.450]  And I guess I'd be what you'd call a variety streamer.
[14:58.650 --> 15:00.670]  Anyway, I've been doing it a couple of times a day lately.
[15:00.770 --> 15:01.770]  I've been kind of addicted to it.
[15:01.770 --> 15:03.310]  And I just don't know why I haven't told you guys yet.
[15:03.330 --> 15:05.110]  But I'm really into streaming. Yeah.
[15:05.490 --> 15:07.750]  OK, what I don't I'm so confused.
[15:07.850 --> 15:08.530]  What does this mean?
[15:08.530 --> 15:11.950]  Here's what I'm concerned with is that he keeps using the word streaming.
[15:12.450 --> 15:15.610]  And I don't probably have different definitions of what streaming might be.
[15:15.910 --> 15:19.590]  I think this is going to be a urine stream thing is what I'm thinking.
[15:20.230 --> 15:21.070]  Urine stream?
[15:21.290 --> 15:22.990]  No, dude, I'm not urine streaming.
[15:23.170 --> 15:23.730]  That's what I'm streaming.
[15:23.750 --> 15:28.130]  I think he's he's like doing a split stream with the he somehow found a way
[15:28.130 --> 15:30.010]  to have it shoot two different ways at once.
[15:30.030 --> 15:31.190]  And he's streaming.
[15:31.510 --> 15:33.430]  That's so fucking weird and gross, dude.
[15:33.810 --> 15:36.230]  You just talked about getting shit all over your hands.
[15:36.310 --> 15:38.050]  I don't want to hear weird and gross from you.
[15:38.670 --> 15:39.990]  Yeah, but I didn't do that on purpose.
[15:40.130 --> 15:41.610]  That was an accident that I had to deal with.
[15:41.630 --> 15:42.710]  I didn't intend to do it.
[15:42.790 --> 15:43.630]  I've been streaming.
[15:44.290 --> 15:45.610]  Oh, you stream, too?
[15:45.810 --> 15:46.550]  Yeah, dude.
[15:46.770 --> 15:47.510]  Come on.
[15:47.970 --> 15:50.810]  I'm fucking addicted to SodaStream.
[15:51.010 --> 15:51.870]  Oh, my God.
[15:52.170 --> 15:54.590]  It is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.
[15:56.890 --> 15:58.350]  Dude, are you fucking kidding me?
[15:59.230 --> 16:00.290]  I got that for Christmas.
[16:00.630 --> 16:03.570]  Here, fucking I'm streaming while we're talking.
[16:04.190 --> 16:05.410]  I'm going to put this in the fucking Discord.
[16:07.290 --> 16:10.210]  So, so you're making soda at home?
[16:10.430 --> 16:12.630]  Yeah, I don't have I don't have any trash anymore.
[16:12.710 --> 16:14.590]  I don't have soda cans to throw away.
[16:14.850 --> 16:19.810]  I make my own grapefruit bubbly with the syrup and a SodaStream machine.
[16:20.330 --> 16:21.450]  Not really a machine.
[16:21.830 --> 16:28.150]  Are you aware of the SodaStream like new drink mix flavor stuff that's coming out?
[16:28.950 --> 16:32.090]  No, I'm just using I'm using I stream mostly
[16:32.730 --> 16:36.490]  Pepsi, Pepsi Zero and Diet Starry.
[16:36.570 --> 16:37.130]  And what do we got?
[16:37.190 --> 16:38.590]  Yeah, Pepsi Max Max.
[16:39.410 --> 16:41.670]  I have a Mountain Dew one.
[16:42.050 --> 16:43.330]  Are these all just like the syrup?
[16:43.910 --> 16:44.950]  Yeah, I think so.
[16:45.090 --> 16:48.590]  Nick also is way into this for a guy who doesn't have one of these.
[16:50.650 --> 16:51.770]  Dude, it's worth it.
[16:52.030 --> 16:52.930]  It's worth it.
[16:52.990 --> 16:53.350]  I might.
[16:54.690 --> 16:55.310]  You might.
[16:55.390 --> 16:56.550]  I thought there'd be more to that.
[16:56.910 --> 16:57.950]  You said it's so exciting.
[16:58.050 --> 17:00.670]  Nick said to like when a seal completes a trick like this.
[17:00.670 --> 17:04.090]  Yeah, this is you're getting face jam, Nick, right now.
[17:04.210 --> 17:05.030]  It's really something.
[17:05.710 --> 17:06.510]  This is something.
[17:07.030 --> 17:12.810]  I looked on my bottle and it says expires October 2026.
[17:13.330 --> 17:14.890]  Oh, mine expires.
[17:15.570 --> 17:19.850]  So I think after a while, the bottle integrity might become slightly more explosive.
[17:22.050 --> 17:23.730]  I think mine expires in 2027.
[17:24.170 --> 17:26.290]  Can I ask a lot of questions about this thing?
[17:27.050 --> 17:28.390]  Yeah, I have some questions, Tim.
[17:28.910 --> 17:30.390]  Is it better for you?
[17:31.510 --> 17:31.810]  No.
[17:31.970 --> 17:32.230]  Than what?
[17:33.010 --> 17:33.790]  Yeah, no.
[17:34.030 --> 17:37.790]  What what do you think than soda?
[17:38.750 --> 17:39.610]  It's cheaper.
[17:40.390 --> 17:41.270]  It's cheaper.
[17:41.570 --> 17:42.530]  And less waste.
[17:42.950 --> 17:43.910]  OK. OK.
[17:44.330 --> 17:48.930]  Can you like make it stronger or is it like a thing like you have like a packet of something?
[17:48.930 --> 17:50.070]  That was my question.
[17:50.410 --> 17:52.390]  Like because you squirt. It's a squirt thing, right?
[17:52.490 --> 17:53.190]  So is it?
[17:53.610 --> 17:56.330]  Well, there's different there's different versions.
[17:56.470 --> 17:57.810]  I don't know which one you have, Gav.
[17:57.810 --> 18:01.610]  But the one I have has three strengths on it, like normal, double or triple.
[18:02.690 --> 18:04.090]  And you can get triple do?
[18:04.690 --> 18:08.050]  Yeah. So you like the way it works is you fill that you fill that glass up
[18:08.050 --> 18:11.050]  or that that plastic bottle up that I have or Gavin has there with water
[18:11.050 --> 18:12.970]  and then you stick it in the machine.
[18:13.070 --> 18:14.830]  The machine has a CO2 cartridge in the back.
[18:14.910 --> 18:18.390]  And then you just hit your strength level and then it shoots that amount in.
[18:18.430 --> 18:21.490]  And then you always go with a little extra because I like yours is fancier than mine.
[18:21.670 --> 18:25.310]  And then I just bought the middle of the road when there was like a cheaper one
[18:25.310 --> 18:26.870]  and a more expensive one. I bought the one right in the middle.
[18:26.870 --> 18:31.410]  I just had to pump three times if I want it normal or like pump it a few more times
[18:31.410 --> 18:32.090]  if I want it stronger.
[18:32.550 --> 18:34.050]  Oh, no, I don't pump like a bitch.
[18:34.130 --> 18:34.830]  I just hit one button.
[18:35.070 --> 18:39.010]  But then you pull it out and then you just pour a cap full of like diet
[18:39.010 --> 18:43.730]  starry in it and then it's immediately a fucking like two liter of soda.
[18:44.470 --> 18:47.570]  Wow. I thought I was being such a dickhead when I posted my SodaStream bottle
[18:47.570 --> 18:50.390]  because I didn't think for a chance that's what you were talking about.
[18:50.390 --> 18:51.590]  100% what I'm talking about.
[18:52.410 --> 18:56.510]  Emily's dad got into SodaStream last summer and when we were visiting,
[18:56.510 --> 18:59.510]  he wouldn't stop talking about it and he was really trying to sell me on it.
[18:59.710 --> 19:02.310]  And I thought, if he's still into it at Christmas, I'll think about it.
[19:02.350 --> 19:06.190]  We went there at Christmas hard into SodaStream, maybe even more so than before.
[19:06.350 --> 19:07.930]  And so when I got home, I said, fuck it.
[19:07.950 --> 19:10.870]  I bought it and it's been the best thing ever.
[19:11.330 --> 19:12.190]  Just the best thing ever.
[19:12.470 --> 19:13.750]  Have you gone to the lab yet?
[19:13.750 --> 19:17.370]  Because that is all I would be doing is mixing and matching different flavors,
[19:17.510 --> 19:19.470]  trying to find the next combination.
[19:20.510 --> 19:25.970]  What I'm doing right now is trying not to fuck it up, because if you do the if you
[19:25.970 --> 19:28.990]  I don't know if you've had this problem yet, Gavin, but if I don't have mine
[19:28.990 --> 19:32.510]  seeded properly, if I'm not paying attention and I just slap it in wrong,
[19:32.610 --> 19:35.370]  it'll shoot carbonated water all over my kitchen.
[19:35.910 --> 19:41.350]  And then if you fuck up and pour the the soda in like you put the water in
[19:41.350 --> 19:44.170]  and then you like pour the Diet Pepsi in before you SodaStream it,
[19:44.390 --> 19:46.350]  that will also explode your entire kitchen.
[19:46.450 --> 19:47.890]  But that's even worse because it's with soda.
[19:48.210 --> 19:49.150]  It's quite shocking.
[19:49.610 --> 19:51.450]  Yeah, I do that probably twice a day right now.
[19:53.490 --> 19:56.510]  Yeah, there's a certain order to things that it's not
[19:56.910 --> 19:59.070]  it's not pissing about when it comes to the instructions.
[20:00.570 --> 20:02.370]  No, no. Take the warning seriously.
[20:03.390 --> 20:05.130]  I don't want you to break your machine,
[20:05.270 --> 20:07.870]  but have you tried experimenting carbonating other things?
[20:07.930 --> 20:10.970]  Like, I feel like that's the other place my brain goes with this device.
[20:11.870 --> 20:13.790]  Carbonated like marinade.
[20:14.210 --> 20:17.490]  Yeah. Or like, yeah, like a condiment, like ketchup or like
[20:17.490 --> 20:22.330]  what is a carbonated mustard tastes like or pickle juice.
[20:24.270 --> 20:26.610]  Applesauce. I'd love to try some carbonated applesauce.
[20:26.830 --> 20:30.290]  I think what we should do is buy one for research purposes
[20:30.290 --> 20:33.250]  and then do that and not ruin Minor Gavin's.
[20:33.370 --> 20:34.510]  Yeah, we'll have a lab version.
[20:35.170 --> 20:36.670]  Yeah, I think that's a great idea.
[20:37.390 --> 20:39.210]  I think there's a guy that carbonated milk, right?
[20:39.230 --> 20:40.130]  But didn't it break it?
[20:40.310 --> 20:42.770]  Like, I think it you have a danger of breaking those things
[20:42.770 --> 20:44.330]  when you do that, from my understanding.
[20:45.190 --> 20:46.250]  But I'd love to know.
[20:46.250 --> 20:47.450]  I'd love to confirm it.
[20:47.990 --> 20:50.890]  I know that if you don't do it exactly the way it tells you to
[20:50.890 --> 20:53.610]  and in the order it tells you to, it makes you pay severely.
[20:56.150 --> 20:59.790]  It makes such a fucking mess, such a mess.
[21:00.010 --> 21:03.070]  To me, whenever I'm using the SodaStream or thinking about other people using it,
[21:03.070 --> 21:04.370]  I just picture Andrew using one.
[21:04.470 --> 21:06.910]  And I'm surprised that you're not a SodaStream guy.
[21:07.310 --> 21:11.730]  I had a SodaStream a very long time ago, like kind of when they were new.
[21:11.890 --> 21:15.110]  And I didn't use it much outside of like the first run.
[21:15.110 --> 21:19.430]  I always had to try to get over the gap of getting another CO2 thing when it expires.
[21:19.530 --> 21:21.650]  That's like a real big detractor for me.
[21:21.930 --> 21:22.770]  It just seems like a hassle.
[21:23.150 --> 21:25.930]  They sell them at Target, but they also have a program
[21:25.930 --> 21:28.730]  where you can mail yours back and they'll mail you a new one for cheaper.
[21:28.910 --> 21:30.290]  And you just have like a return program.
[21:30.630 --> 21:33.190]  Do you think if I just lock the empty canister in my office
[21:33.190 --> 21:35.110]  with all the cats, we'll refill it ourselves?
[21:35.790 --> 21:36.050]  Eventually.
[21:41.250 --> 21:42.050]  Oh, shit.
[21:43.210 --> 21:45.350]  Andrew. Andrew and I played trucks the other night.
[21:45.450 --> 21:46.590]  Oh, my God. Yeah.
[21:46.670 --> 21:48.730]  I didn't even put down my notes. We did the truck thing.
[21:48.970 --> 21:50.550]  We played trucks. We finally did it.
[21:51.070 --> 21:54.750]  With the full crew, Bernie and Antonio and Andrew and I.
[21:54.930 --> 21:55.870]  You played early enough?
[21:56.370 --> 21:59.830]  Yeah. We worked it out on Monday night where Andrew
[21:59.830 --> 22:02.630]  Andrew made a block of time available for us.
[22:02.690 --> 22:04.090]  And we were able to fit that in.
[22:04.450 --> 22:07.790]  And Andrew got the full experience of being hit,
[22:08.030 --> 22:10.030]  being out of the game more than we were in it.
[22:10.030 --> 22:14.470]  We probably traveled a total of, I don't know, how far would you say?
[22:14.550 --> 22:16.370]  Sixty yards, maybe at most.
[22:16.570 --> 22:18.630]  Yeah, but probably not very far.
[22:18.750 --> 22:22.410]  No, no. It was a great experience.
[22:22.670 --> 22:26.450]  One, just to it was nice to see a different side of Geoff.
[22:26.590 --> 22:29.250]  Trucks Geoff is a lot of fun to hang out with.
[22:29.350 --> 22:33.350]  Not that I dislike any other side of Geoff, but you you're definitely a trucks.
[22:33.470 --> 22:35.030]  Geoff is a whole other entity.
[22:35.170 --> 22:36.190]  It's a different vibe, man.
[22:36.290 --> 22:39.930]  I'm trying to get like trucks to me is and that's why I'm so glad you hopped in.
[22:40.030 --> 22:43.030]  Because I just I think you have to be in it to catch.
[22:43.410 --> 22:44.790]  Absolutely. And I want that.
[22:44.910 --> 22:48.150]  I want the content to feel like what that is, if that makes sense.
[22:48.250 --> 22:49.990]  I had such a good time.
[22:50.390 --> 22:53.770]  And Gavin, you haven't even experienced this window of it
[22:53.770 --> 22:55.450]  because your Spotify or whatever doesn't work.
[22:55.770 --> 22:57.590]  But I got the Spotify thing.
[22:57.690 --> 22:59.650]  I was listening to the music with them.
[22:59.690 --> 23:01.970]  I was really feeling I was having such a good time.
[23:01.990 --> 23:04.110]  And I had to leave before they did.
[23:04.250 --> 23:08.050]  And I just spent the rest of my night continuing to listen to that playlist.
[23:08.050 --> 23:10.010]  I was just sitting in bed listening to it.
[23:10.110 --> 23:11.390]  I think I'm sorted out now, though.
[23:11.570 --> 23:13.750]  Oh, really? Geoff added me to his family plan.
[23:14.270 --> 23:16.550]  Yeah, I did. I tried to add Andrew, but it didn't work.
[23:16.710 --> 23:17.650]  But he was able to not work.
[23:17.870 --> 23:20.590]  Yeah, it said you are not a fucker.
[23:20.750 --> 23:22.790]  You're in Canada. We're not falling for this.
[23:23.190 --> 23:25.270]  I had so much fun. They loved you, Andrew.
[23:25.370 --> 23:26.350]  They thought, oh, that's wonderful.
[23:26.690 --> 23:28.050]  Yeah, they were so nice to meet.
[23:28.130 --> 23:29.790]  Bernie loves to talk about art with anyone.
[23:29.870 --> 23:32.250]  And you were you seemed really interested in.
[23:32.630 --> 23:35.410]  Oh, absolutely. Yeah, I think that's how you win his heart over.
[23:35.810 --> 23:38.790]  Um, anyway, so I just I wanted to say thank you.
[23:38.990 --> 23:40.350]  I was really glad I was really fun.
[23:40.450 --> 23:42.050]  And I'm really I'm glad you enjoyed it.
[23:42.050 --> 23:45.110]  And I'm glad you caught whatever that is, because I think now
[23:45.110 --> 23:48.670]  when we make trucks content going forward, it yes, it'll be different.
[23:49.310 --> 23:52.110]  And because we kind of we get to see trucks, Geoff.
[23:52.130 --> 23:56.410]  We did a second video of trucks where you are like mother goose
[23:56.410 --> 24:00.190]  and we are just lost ducklings is sort of the feeling it had.
[24:00.210 --> 24:01.750]  We're we're all stuck in the mud.
[24:01.750 --> 24:04.910]  And you're just so patient and calm with us as you pull us out.
[24:04.910 --> 24:06.910]  That's the thing I like about trucks, man.
[24:06.990 --> 24:11.030]  No matter how rough it gets in the mud, there's no bad vibes in trucks.
[24:11.750 --> 24:13.170]  It's all good and supportive.
[24:13.410 --> 24:14.130]  It's all helpful.
[24:14.490 --> 24:17.290]  It's all just about it's not even about finishing the mission.
[24:17.430 --> 24:19.530]  It's just about making incremental progress.
[24:19.730 --> 24:24.090]  In the second trucks video, Geoff, you loaned me your really good truck.
[24:24.370 --> 24:26.870]  And I felt like I felt like I felt free.
[24:29.970 --> 24:33.130]  Yeah. Because when we so we finished a trucks video
[24:33.130 --> 24:37.410]  and I was so stuck, like Nick said, I felt Nick says he feels stuck.
[24:38.190 --> 24:41.170]  I was I spent the entire time on the side of a mountain.
[24:41.390 --> 24:45.950]  I had a headache after we finished because I was so mud stuck the entire time
[24:45.950 --> 24:47.810]  and felt like I did nothing.
[24:48.290 --> 24:50.510]  I know. And I just thought you guys were trying to be funny.
[24:51.410 --> 24:55.010]  No, I was stuck and I couldn't do anything.
[24:55.010 --> 24:55.690]  It was terrible.
[24:55.850 --> 25:00.190]  Like I had fun, but it was just so frustrating trying to get out of the mud
[25:00.190 --> 25:04.730]  and getting stuck that I spent the next like five days every whenever I had time
[25:04.730 --> 25:07.330]  to play games, I was exclusively playing trucks.
[25:07.770 --> 25:09.610]  I got the tire chains. I'm ready.
[25:09.730 --> 25:12.830]  So next time we record going to be completely different story.
[25:13.110 --> 25:14.950]  I'm ready. I'm ready. OK, that sounds great.
[25:15.110 --> 25:16.930]  And I can always loan out cars to y'all, too.
[25:17.010 --> 25:19.290]  Like it doesn't have to be about y'all using shitty vehicles.
[25:19.310 --> 25:21.870]  Like when you know, when we play trucks, we use all of Antonio's vehicles.
[25:21.930 --> 25:23.030]  I don't even ever use mine.
[25:23.970 --> 25:26.030]  But that's just for the for getting kicked purposes,
[25:26.050 --> 25:28.630]  which you saw very quickly is a must.
[25:28.630 --> 25:32.170]  Otherwise, you'd be wiping out all progress every time you kicked,
[25:32.250 --> 25:34.270]  which I mean, you'd kill yourself pretty fast.
[25:34.870 --> 25:39.870]  So did you know, Gavin, that that Antonio and Burndog
[25:40.510 --> 25:45.010]  use the trucking vernacular were trucks guys before they met Geoff?
[25:45.610 --> 25:46.510]  This is a sigh.
[25:46.590 --> 25:50.210]  I thought this is such a funny story that I heard when I was playing.
[25:50.370 --> 25:52.670]  I feel like I knew that they're the longtime truckers.
[25:52.990 --> 25:57.350]  They were longtime truckers, but they didn't want to introduce Geoff to it
[25:57.350 --> 25:59.790]  because they were scared it would like intimidate him
[25:59.790 --> 26:01.290]  and he would stop playing games with them.
[26:01.750 --> 26:04.770]  So like, yeah, I think about when they first started
[26:04.770 --> 26:07.710]  and Geoff was like, I've been up playing Call of Duty till 2 a.m.
[26:07.710 --> 26:08.770]  every night. This is great.
[26:08.890 --> 26:12.550]  And their minds, they really miss trucks, but they didn't want to force him
[26:12.550 --> 26:16.010]  to play trucks because they were scared he'd stop playing games with them.
[26:16.130 --> 26:19.690]  And then when Geoff eventually got to the point where he was initiating trucks,
[26:19.810 --> 26:20.910]  it was a game changer.
[26:21.230 --> 26:22.310]  And I just thought that was so funny.
[26:22.910 --> 26:25.130]  Yeah, they were like, finally, we can stop pretending
[26:25.130 --> 26:26.450]  they'll want to play these other games.
[26:26.450 --> 26:29.090]  I played so much Call of Duty Zombies.
[26:29.230 --> 26:31.910]  I didn't really give a shit about just because I wanted to hang out with them
[26:31.910 --> 26:34.290]  and I was having fun when we could have been playing trucks the whole time.
[26:34.370 --> 26:35.310]  Back when it worked, too.
[26:35.670 --> 26:36.590]  I'm back in on cart.
[26:36.790 --> 26:41.590]  They're so old on trucks that they played all this on the PS4 version.
[26:41.870 --> 26:44.630]  They're redoing it all on the Xbox because they got Xboxes.
[26:44.690 --> 26:46.230]  I bet the PS4 version worked better.
[26:46.550 --> 26:47.410]  It did. Yeah.
[26:47.730 --> 26:50.670]  The Xbox, the original Xbox one version works better, too.
[26:50.750 --> 26:54.190]  But we got a new trucks game coming out in like a month and a half
[26:54.190 --> 26:57.610]  that I'm very excited about and I'm hoping it will fix those stability issues.
[26:57.850 --> 27:00.230]  It's unfortunately not going to launch with co-op.
[27:00.350 --> 27:01.510]  I don't think. Oh, really?
[27:01.790 --> 27:02.890]  It'll be patched in later.
[27:02.990 --> 27:04.210]  We were doing some research last night.
[27:04.290 --> 27:08.190]  We were playing when we were brutal the night you and I played Andrew
[27:08.190 --> 27:11.030]  where we got kicked so much last night made that look like a success.
[27:11.050 --> 27:11.550]  Oh, my God.
[27:12.490 --> 27:16.150]  I almost texted them last night at 1230 after we stopped and said,
[27:16.230 --> 27:17.530]  I need to take a couple of weeks off of trucks.
[27:17.610 --> 27:18.370]  I was so frustrated.
[27:19.770 --> 27:21.490]  But anyway, so I don't know.
[27:21.570 --> 27:23.030]  I don't know that'll be an immediate help.
[27:23.030 --> 27:27.890]  But supposedly the new DLC season 12 will fix the stability issues.
[27:27.970 --> 27:29.730]  We'll see you playing a lot of Call of Duty, Gavin.
[27:30.190 --> 27:31.430]  Yeah, I've just been playing Warzone again.
[27:31.490 --> 27:35.230]  I've been playing with Meg and I like the new map. It's nice.
[27:35.510 --> 27:38.310]  Well, I don't know how new it is, but I haven't played since the last map.
[27:38.930 --> 27:40.870]  I haven't been inviting you to trucks.
[27:40.990 --> 27:43.290]  I've seen you on a couple of times playing Call of Duty,
[27:43.310 --> 27:45.190]  and I just assumed you were playing with Dan or something.
[27:45.250 --> 27:46.270]  I don't want to bug you.
[27:46.950 --> 27:49.290]  But now that I know you're playing with Meg, I'll bug you.
[27:51.570 --> 27:54.190]  I've been doing a thing where whenever I find a bomb drone,
[27:54.570 --> 27:58.050]  I just stay near the edge of the smoke and I look up at the skyscrapers
[27:58.050 --> 28:02.430]  and I wait for people to jump off the building and start parachuting back
[28:02.430 --> 28:03.070]  into the circle.
[28:03.210 --> 28:06.170]  And I just crash bomb drones into their face while they're on parachutes.
[28:06.370 --> 28:07.330]  And it's so...
[28:07.330 --> 28:08.070]  Is it easy to do?
[28:08.650 --> 28:09.690]  I've done it a few times.
[28:09.990 --> 28:12.510]  They get downed in the air and then just splat into the street.
[28:15.170 --> 28:16.590]  Can we try that in a video?
[28:16.810 --> 28:17.690]  That sounds very hefty.
[28:17.690 --> 28:19.430]  It's it's so satisfying.
[28:19.850 --> 28:20.930]  Oh, that sounds great.
[28:21.030 --> 28:21.270]  So funny.
[28:26.580 --> 28:28.400]  The best way to learn a language?
[28:28.700 --> 28:32.200]  Immersion. Living where the language is spoken and using it every day.
[28:32.680 --> 28:35.840]  But if that's not in the cards this year, you can still learn a language
[28:35.840 --> 28:36.980]  the second best way.
[28:37.420 --> 28:38.360]  And that's with Babbel.
[28:38.740 --> 28:43.440]  Babbel is a way to learn languages in the best way, in my opinion, at least.
[28:43.780 --> 28:46.300]  And you can be a better you in 2024 with Babbel,
[28:46.700 --> 28:49.380]  the science-backed language learning app that actually works.
[28:49.380 --> 28:52.540]  Babbel's tips and tools are approachable, accessible,
[28:53.120 --> 28:56.900]  rooted in real life situations and delivered with conversation based teaching.
[28:57.100 --> 28:59.860]  So you're ready to practice what you've learned in the real world.
[29:00.200 --> 29:01.540]  And that's what's so exciting about Babbel.
[29:01.900 --> 29:04.480]  They have this great, easy to learn course.
[29:04.600 --> 29:08.000]  So, I mean, all the courses are great and easy to learn, but they help you learn
[29:08.000 --> 29:11.580]  real life language and conversation skills in different languages.
[29:11.580 --> 29:15.980]  So it's easier when you're abroad to order food or ask for directions
[29:15.980 --> 29:19.300]  like all those sort of key language based things.
[29:19.460 --> 29:20.220]  They are great with.
[29:20.300 --> 29:23.020]  They have such great programs for and it's really easy to pick up.
[29:23.140 --> 29:25.180]  The other thing that they do, which is so awesome,
[29:25.320 --> 29:30.360]  is they provide pronunciation checks for for speech recognition.
[29:30.420 --> 29:33.080]  And it's awesome because if you're not pronouncing a word correctly,
[29:33.240 --> 29:35.400]  then it's almost like you're not saying it right at all.
[29:35.440 --> 29:37.960]  Like it's it's a different it's a difficult language barrier.
[29:37.960 --> 29:39.720]  It's just a fantastic service.
[29:40.040 --> 29:43.640]  And here's a special limited time deal for our listeners.

[30:00.260 --> 30:01.940]  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[30:02.100 --> 30:03.520]  We're deep in 2024.
[30:04.220 --> 30:05.960]  We have different goals we're trying to pursue.
[30:06.160 --> 30:09.600]  I'm doing like general better health,
[30:09.960 --> 30:12.520]  just all around trying to focus on sleep.
[30:12.520 --> 30:15.860]  And this just ways to improve my day to day life.
[30:16.140 --> 30:20.540]  Also, obviously, increased grip strength, as I've talked extensively about.
[30:21.400 --> 30:24.860]  But, you know, around New Year's, we get obsessed with how to change ourselves
[30:24.860 --> 30:27.100]  instead of just expanding on what we're already doing right.
[30:27.760 --> 30:30.640]  Maybe you finally organize one part of your space and you want to tackle another.
[30:30.780 --> 30:32.540]  That is something I've been doing is a lot of cleaning,
[30:32.660 --> 30:35.820]  how it led to a leg injury, but hopefully that won't happen to you.
[30:35.880 --> 30:37.920]  Or maybe you're taking your supplements every morning

[30:43.140 --> 30:44.820]  and make changes that really stick.
[30:45.540 --> 30:48.300]  Therapy is something that I couldn't recommend enough.

[30:51.000 --> 30:54.420]  It has allowed me to find solutions to problems
[30:54.420 --> 30:56.520]  that I didn't even necessarily know that I had.
[30:57.140 --> 31:01.940]  It's just all around a great experience that I would highly recommend.

[32:46.320 --> 32:49.860]  Oh, man, we're in kind of like a lull for games, and then it's going to ramp back up
[32:49.860 --> 32:51.840]  and I can't wait to have new stuff to play.
[32:52.700 --> 32:54.480]  There's a new Prince of Persia that looks cool.
[32:54.700 --> 32:57.940]  I'm really excited about that truck game, although I didn't realize it doesn't have online co-op,
[32:58.040 --> 33:01.980]  but I reached out to them and it sounds like we might be able to get an early code for Geoff.
[33:01.980 --> 33:09.660]  So I wanted to do like a let's play video where it's Geoff and the truck crew just like showing off the new game and like looking at stuff.
[33:10.040 --> 33:12.480]  I'm really hopeful that comes together. I think that'd be awesome.
[33:13.060 --> 33:15.340]  I saw somebody in the comments. We talk about game stuff.
[33:15.440 --> 33:19.540]  I saw somebody in the comments somewhere said was like, why haven't they played Garfield Kart together?
[33:20.600 --> 33:23.140]  Yeah, I need to double check that that has online multiplayer.
[33:23.340 --> 33:29.380]  That is such like I never wanted to force anyone else to play Garfield Kart when I was deep into that.
[33:29.460 --> 33:31.160]  But that would be a great video.
[33:31.680 --> 33:37.500]  I bought it so that I could try to beat your times and I gave up after a couple hours of trying.
[33:37.720 --> 33:38.320]  I was like, never mind.
[33:38.500 --> 33:43.480]  I was so far off the mark and I so didn't see a path to getting better to that level.
[33:43.600 --> 33:44.560]  I just gave up immediately.
[33:45.100 --> 33:47.360]  Oh, by the way, Andrew, I beat one of your Halo times.
[33:47.940 --> 33:48.340]  What?
[33:48.760 --> 33:51.120]  Oh, are you serious?
[33:51.560 --> 33:53.640]  Oh, shit. Whoa.
[33:55.260 --> 33:56.640]  How does this work?
[33:56.720 --> 33:58.980]  Does he have 24 hours?
[33:58.980 --> 34:01.920]  Do you have 24 hours to respond?
[34:02.060 --> 34:05.240]  He has to figure out what it is, what it is, like beat the time.
[34:05.280 --> 34:06.980]  He's got 24 hours from right now.
[34:07.180 --> 34:07.980]  Wow. Start the clock.
[34:08.220 --> 34:10.700]  I hope you didn't have any plans for the next 24 hours.
[34:11.420 --> 34:13.920]  I'm looking. I have my games to have up right now.
[34:13.980 --> 34:17.500]  I got to start deleting stuff because I don't even have it's MCC, I'm assuming.
[34:17.860 --> 34:19.500]  Yeah, it has to be right. Yeah.
[34:19.960 --> 34:23.480]  Halo 2. Oh, no, no, you didn't.
[34:24.460 --> 34:26.020]  It's not the same level, is it?
[34:26.380 --> 34:27.140]  It's a different level.
[34:27.140 --> 34:29.560]  Oh, different. That's the one y'all streamed so bad.
[34:30.020 --> 34:31.300]  Yeah, that was the one we did.
[34:31.400 --> 34:32.200]  That was yeah.
[34:32.320 --> 34:35.820]  When we were done with the right, the outskirts one, I just I
[34:36.440 --> 34:37.920]  refused to ever play that level again.
[34:40.800 --> 34:43.860]  I'm OK. Well, I'll see if I can figure out what this is by the time we
[34:43.860 --> 34:45.260]  unless unless we already did this.
[34:45.800 --> 34:46.820]  Did you already beat me back?
[34:47.240 --> 34:49.000]  This was months ago that I beat your time.
[34:49.920 --> 34:53.000]  If you just declared that you beat my time
[34:53.000 --> 34:55.800]  and I've already taken the time back and it's on your side.
[34:55.800 --> 34:58.680]  Well, I was holding it just to use whatever came up.
[34:58.820 --> 35:01.580]  But I'm wondering if I already spent it now.
[35:03.820 --> 35:08.880]  OK, I am that what you just described really sums up this podcast.
[35:11.180 --> 35:14.980]  Yeah. Did I already use this bullet or did I get like an empty case in my revolver?
[35:15.340 --> 35:16.200]  You got to stop.
[35:16.360 --> 35:18.600]  You got to start deleting your notes after you say it.
[35:20.460 --> 35:21.620]  Oh, my God.
[35:21.800 --> 35:23.640]  Nick said, I just cashed a bad check.
[35:30.630 --> 35:32.810]  Oh, I don't know, Gavin.
[35:32.930 --> 35:33.990]  I was so pumped.
[35:34.110 --> 35:35.410]  I was so excited.
[35:35.630 --> 35:39.170]  And now it's just like, I don't know, maybe I don't remember spending this one yet.
[35:39.230 --> 35:42.250]  I've been holding it for a while, but
[35:42.250 --> 35:44.490]  I'm installing it right now.
[35:44.610 --> 35:46.450]  We've been doing this podcast too long, I think.
[35:46.550 --> 35:47.910]  Oh, can I cloud play this?
[35:53.010 --> 35:54.350]  Let's let's clear the queue.
[35:54.570 --> 35:56.290]  I want to see if I can cloud launch this.
[35:57.990 --> 36:04.470]  Oh, I said, Gavin, if you if you already played this.
[36:06.690 --> 36:07.510]  I thought.
[36:07.950 --> 36:09.950]  Do you know when you made the note?
[36:10.250 --> 36:11.070]  It's not even a note.
[36:11.170 --> 36:13.670]  I just think after last time we had one of these go around.
[36:13.810 --> 36:15.110]  It's just a thing you remember.
[36:15.530 --> 36:18.570]  Yeah, I just thought, well, I'll quickly be another level and I'll just whip it out
[36:18.570 --> 36:20.450]  whenever like times comes up.
[36:21.270 --> 36:25.370]  Oh, and it is I feel like it is possible that I have already got it back
[36:25.370 --> 36:29.610]  because I would there was a time when I would just randomly check and then try to.
[36:29.790 --> 36:31.810]  Well, I can tell you the level if you want to check this.
[36:32.230 --> 36:34.050]  Yeah, tell me the level and I'm already in it.
[36:34.170 --> 36:35.350]  I already cloud played it up.
[36:35.410 --> 36:35.910]  It's loading.
[36:36.350 --> 36:38.110]  OK, it is a regret.
[36:39.790 --> 36:41.830]  Oh, the irony, if this is.
[36:46.490 --> 36:47.730]  That's beautiful, Gavin.
[36:48.090 --> 36:49.050]  This rules.
[36:49.950 --> 36:52.610]  Oh, I always bite off more than I can chew at this one.
[36:52.650 --> 36:54.170]  And sometimes I bite nothing.
[36:54.170 --> 36:55.930]  I'm just chewing jack shit.
[36:56.350 --> 36:59.610]  I need to even remember how to view the leaderboard for this.
[36:59.690 --> 37:00.630]  I think I just bit a rock.
[37:01.010 --> 37:04.390]  OK, your board's campaign timing.
[37:04.930 --> 37:07.890]  Halo 2 on Legendary, I assume.
[37:08.330 --> 37:09.950]  Yeah, you're Gavin.
[37:10.090 --> 37:12.870]  You're getting to the age where your memory is starting to slip.
[37:12.990 --> 37:14.430]  And I am enjoying it.
[37:14.630 --> 37:17.370]  Well, there's a lot of lore and it's hard to remember it all.
[37:17.990 --> 37:19.190]  Yeah. Uh-huh.
[37:20.870 --> 37:22.470]  OK, displaying friends.
[37:22.470 --> 37:23.190]  Let's see.
[37:23.350 --> 37:25.410]  I saw you in that Worms video the other day.
[37:25.470 --> 37:29.270]  Your mind was slipping there, too, and that wasn't anything to do with lore.
[37:29.970 --> 37:31.650]  I need to go to bed is what I need to do.
[37:32.030 --> 37:33.630]  You stay up and play trucks with me.
[37:33.730 --> 37:36.010]  That's that's what you're fucking up.
[37:37.970 --> 37:40.130]  One of my notes says big hot dick.
[37:40.590 --> 37:43.830]  I don't know what the fuck is going on.
[37:44.210 --> 37:45.250]  What is happening?
[37:46.830 --> 37:48.350]  What is big hot dick?
[37:49.150 --> 37:50.890]  This is so crazy.
[37:50.890 --> 37:51.970]  Go on.
[37:53.970 --> 37:58.630]  I wish you I wish the notes app would tell you the day and time you wrote the note.
[37:58.810 --> 37:59.310]  I know.
[37:59.470 --> 38:01.670]  Wouldn't that help if it was like 3 p.m.
[38:01.710 --> 38:04.470]  Wednesday? You'd be like, all right, that guy had a big hot dick.
[38:06.390 --> 38:08.950]  So this is the current leaderboard for regret.
[38:12.270 --> 38:13.750]  It's not even close.
[38:14.010 --> 38:16.870]  I have I have a six minute lead on you.
[38:17.470 --> 38:18.650]  That can't be right.
[38:19.130 --> 38:20.890]  Dude, come on. Is that up to date?
[38:22.470 --> 38:24.010]  What do you mean, is it up to date?
[38:24.630 --> 38:27.250]  You think he just has an old file?
[38:27.630 --> 38:31.030]  No, sometimes it doesn't show the actual proper time.
[38:31.110 --> 38:32.850]  Like if I load it up, it might be different.
[38:33.130 --> 38:35.090]  We'll load it up. Oh, shit.
[38:35.370 --> 38:37.510]  This is a whole thing. Come on, you got to load it up.
[38:38.350 --> 38:39.510]  Oh, my God.
[38:40.830 --> 38:41.990]  Oh, my God.
[38:42.850 --> 38:43.570]  Six minutes.
[38:44.630 --> 38:46.110]  Wow. Are you sure it's regret?
[38:46.630 --> 38:48.710]  I'm going to just go through every level.
[38:48.990 --> 38:52.270]  What's the one where you punch the regret to death at the end?
[38:52.950 --> 38:54.130]  I think that's regret.
[38:54.310 --> 38:55.110]  OK, that one.
[38:55.790 --> 38:56.710]  OK, so let's see.
[38:57.270 --> 38:58.930]  I don't even think the armory has.
[38:59.130 --> 39:00.630]  You have 12 minutes on that.
[39:03.810 --> 39:04.690]  Oh, yeah.
[39:06.550 --> 39:08.550]  I'm one of the dumbest people I've ever met.
[39:09.230 --> 39:11.810]  All you had to do was not bring this up.
[39:11.930 --> 39:14.730]  I know. Why did I think I had one in the bag?
[39:16.110 --> 39:17.690]  What? Let me rummage around this bag.
[39:17.830 --> 39:18.750]  I need to look at other levels.
[39:19.530 --> 39:23.870]  I mean, there are ones where you have a faster time than me, but...
[39:23.870 --> 39:26.210]  Oh, which one? Show me then, you fool.
[39:26.270 --> 39:26.870]  Which one's that?
[39:27.990 --> 39:29.830]  You're calling me a fool?
[39:30.910 --> 39:32.630]  Show me, you fool.
[39:34.590 --> 39:37.350]  Oh, the bloody Master Chief collection needs an update.
[39:38.150 --> 39:39.530]  Oh, yeah, you're faster than that.
[39:39.550 --> 39:42.630]  You have a few. What's hilarious is you have multiple that are faster.
[39:42.770 --> 39:43.770]  It's just not regret.
[39:44.770 --> 39:46.390]  Oh, not that one.
[39:46.450 --> 39:48.970]  Was it, uh, was it Cairo Station?
[39:49.170 --> 39:51.910]  What one am I? Yeah, you got a Cairo Station one.
[39:53.110 --> 39:54.330]  So I just did a ton.
[39:54.530 --> 39:55.890]  And then I just never mentioned it.
[39:56.130 --> 39:58.430]  OK, you've done two so far.
[39:59.070 --> 40:02.410]  OK, I wish I wish I'd remembered the right one that would have.
[40:03.330 --> 40:04.830]  Oh, OK, you got Sacred Icon.
[40:05.130 --> 40:09.130]  So glad you didn't. Oh, 27 gig update.
[40:09.270 --> 40:10.950]  Three Quarantine Zone.
[40:11.230 --> 40:13.030]  Let me see if I can load this game up.
[40:14.050 --> 40:16.750]  You got your twice as fast than that for me.
[40:16.830 --> 40:18.070]  Well, at least I got a few.
[40:18.490 --> 40:19.750]  Yeah, you absolutely do.
[40:20.010 --> 40:21.590]  You just issued the wrong challenge.
[40:22.170 --> 40:22.530]  I don't know.
[40:22.630 --> 40:24.490]  Sometimes I look at the leaderboard and it's different
[40:24.490 --> 40:26.190]  depending on the console I'm on or PC.
[40:26.710 --> 40:28.330]  Well, I can just see what I'm seeing.
[40:28.850 --> 40:31.790]  Well, I'm loading the game up right now, so I'll see.
[40:33.430 --> 40:35.310]  Hopefully we're friends, I think.
[40:36.030 --> 40:37.470]  Wow. A 12 minute regret.
[40:37.590 --> 40:38.750]  That seems really fast.
[40:39.390 --> 40:41.190]  Why? That was when I ran a lot.
[40:41.550 --> 40:43.010]  It's almost 13 minutes.
[40:43.010 --> 40:43.850]  It's 12.54.
[40:44.770 --> 40:47.270]  The thing is, with the moment we're doing the Halo times,
[40:47.390 --> 40:48.990]  you're so much better at it than I am.
[40:49.130 --> 40:51.170]  Like, you're so much sneakier in coming up with strategies.
[40:51.550 --> 40:56.010]  I genuinely felt like I was lucky to win that Halo 2 speed racing bet with you.
[40:56.330 --> 40:57.790]  You had such a good time.
[40:57.890 --> 40:59.790]  I just I really couldn't make up any ground.
[41:00.390 --> 41:04.350]  I had a time and it only it was like the second run of that day.
[41:04.710 --> 41:05.990]  And it just everything worked.
[41:06.090 --> 41:11.350]  I've tried to do the Billy Mitchell thing of like having a new time
[41:11.930 --> 41:15.370]  preloaded to go when you eventually beat it.
[41:15.450 --> 41:18.410]  And I just have not been able to ever get close enough to that.
[41:18.750 --> 41:19.730]  How do you see the times?
[41:20.850 --> 41:22.110]  It's in leaderboards.
[41:22.830 --> 41:26.230]  It's a. That is such a bummer because I spent so much time
[41:26.230 --> 41:27.670]  trying to sneak a new regret time.
[41:28.510 --> 41:31.370]  There's no way I settled for 18 minutes and decided that was good.
[41:31.750 --> 41:32.270]  Is that extra?
[41:33.130 --> 41:34.770]  Maybe. Go to options.
[41:35.350 --> 41:36.450]  Yeah. Options and career.
[41:36.990 --> 41:40.550]  Yeah. And then go to leaderboards and then tab to campaign timing.
[41:40.550 --> 41:41.670]  And then Halo two.
[41:41.950 --> 41:45.630]  And you can swap to friends and legendary.
[41:46.990 --> 41:49.090]  OK, what is the map regret?
[41:49.830 --> 41:52.050]  I have a few friends.
[41:53.310 --> 41:55.070]  I have Andrew at.
[41:55.510 --> 41:56.210]  Oh, you said legendary.
[41:56.330 --> 41:57.850]  What do you switch it to? Legendary.
[41:57.910 --> 41:59.330]  Right tab. Right bumper.
[41:59.890 --> 42:00.450]  Oh, I see.
[42:01.450 --> 42:02.750]  OK, I see.
[42:03.130 --> 42:07.570]  Andrew has a time of 1254
[42:07.570 --> 42:10.190]  and Gavin has a time of 1638.
[42:10.550 --> 42:11.890]  Oh, it's different. Faster.
[42:12.630 --> 42:13.670]  1838. I'm sorry.
[42:13.750 --> 42:15.970]  Oh, shit. Shit.
[42:16.170 --> 42:17.870]  But freaking asshole.
[42:19.210 --> 42:21.930]  Oh, I give you two minutes there.
[42:22.030 --> 42:23.170]  It just keeps getting better.
[42:23.270 --> 42:24.650]  This is the best thing we've ever done.
[42:25.470 --> 42:27.330]  I'll have mine updated in three minutes.
[42:27.450 --> 42:28.190]  So I'm going to look at mine.
[42:28.530 --> 42:30.670]  I don't know if it's not different on mine.
[42:30.750 --> 42:32.030]  I don't know what I was thinking.
[42:33.770 --> 42:36.230]  You said it's ugly to regret.
[42:37.570 --> 42:39.150]  Spend all my time on regret.
[42:40.750 --> 42:42.210]  Really? That's unfortunate.
[42:43.970 --> 42:45.370]  I wonder if I trapped the time.
[42:45.450 --> 42:47.390]  I wonder if I just never did the end.
[42:47.910 --> 42:49.330]  That would be wild.
[42:52.250 --> 42:53.490]  Oh, my God.
[42:53.550 --> 42:55.070]  You better load that game up and look.
[42:55.230 --> 42:56.990]  Oh, I suck. I suck.
[42:57.090 --> 42:58.190]  My brain sucks.
[42:59.090 --> 43:03.510]  I can't. I don't even know how to feel like I feel like this challenge
[43:03.510 --> 43:05.250]  hasn't started whenever we do the next.
[43:06.030 --> 43:08.690]  If you've trapped it, like I don't think it starts
[43:08.690 --> 43:11.790]  when you tell me which time I've got this better than yours or that I.
[43:14.150 --> 43:17.970]  How about you double check your time so we can run this back next time
[43:17.970 --> 43:20.490]  we do an episode, I'll act all surprised.
[43:20.630 --> 43:24.870]  I'll be like, oh, my God, this fucking video game shit turned out to be so fun.
[43:26.350 --> 43:29.890]  Oh, by the way, did you see Jack's next time on from the episode?
[43:30.090 --> 43:31.330]  No, yesterday? Yeah.
[43:31.650 --> 43:33.190]  It's a venom in it. Yeah.
[43:34.450 --> 43:37.530]  It's a venom towards Andrew. Pretty. Towards me.
[43:38.570 --> 43:40.910]  I'm the one that argued that he was good.
[43:41.210 --> 43:43.270]  Ultimately, you guys called him a ring doorbell.
[43:46.610 --> 43:48.750]  You were way meaner than I was.
[43:49.270 --> 43:53.010]  I mean, my idea was to put the doorbell sound, but that was because Geoff called him
[43:53.010 --> 43:56.230]  a doorbell. Oh, I'm not going to get gaslit on this one.
[43:56.290 --> 43:58.350]  I was like, you know what? I'm sorry, Jack, you're good on this.
[43:58.350 --> 43:59.890]  You're the one who said his filming was shit.
[43:59.950 --> 44:00.950]  That's not what I said.
[44:01.470 --> 44:06.050]  Hmm. I said that I was misled by you, Gavin, because I thought it was the final cut.
[44:06.350 --> 44:08.130]  And then I apologize for it.
[44:08.210 --> 44:09.410]  And then I did a joke apology.
[44:09.870 --> 44:14.530]  I've never jumped to more conclusions than that fruit throw video of anything we've ever done.
[44:17.450 --> 44:23.290]  Well, I just if you said, do you want an edited version or just a raw version?
[44:23.410 --> 44:25.850]  I said, do you want the video or the raw footage from my phone?
[44:26.590 --> 44:27.510]  You said edited.
[44:29.390 --> 44:31.350]  Right. I hadn't done it yet.
[44:31.730 --> 44:33.310]  How am I supposed to know that?
[44:33.750 --> 44:35.750]  Well, we already had this debate.
[44:35.810 --> 44:36.710]  It's fine. We're moving on.
[44:36.830 --> 44:38.310]  We're doing the fucking regret thing.
[44:39.150 --> 44:40.450]  There's no regret thing.
[44:40.490 --> 44:45.290]  My point is, Jack better have given venom to YouTube because I was trying to be amicable.
[44:46.010 --> 44:47.950]  No, I think all the venom was to you.
[44:48.190 --> 44:49.930]  Yeah, I think Gavin are pretty free from it.
[44:50.490 --> 44:51.670]  That was great.
[44:52.150 --> 44:55.410]  I even saw him in the hallway yesterday and he hugged me and said he missed me.
[44:55.890 --> 44:57.070]  It's true. I saw that.
[44:57.190 --> 44:57.490]  I I'm not going to lie.
[44:57.490 --> 44:59.470]  I can verify Geoff's claim.
[44:59.950 --> 45:01.690]  Yeah, it was a good hug, too.
[45:01.990 --> 45:03.370]  I could tell he meant it.
[45:03.830 --> 45:05.110]  Are we doing office stuff on Friday?
[45:05.770 --> 45:08.350]  Uh, I think we're baking pies, right?
[45:08.850 --> 45:11.090]  Yeah, so we're pies and croutons.
[45:11.650 --> 45:14.670]  We have all these cosmic crisp apples that we got to make pies out of.
[45:14.990 --> 45:18.250]  But I want us to do it without a recipe, which I made clear to Geoff.
[45:18.330 --> 45:19.390]  So Geoff looked up a recipe.
[45:20.590 --> 45:26.090]  Um, all I did was look up cooking times because I just have no frame of reference for how long to cook a pie.
[45:26.090 --> 45:31.430]  Hey, Gavin, if I said we're going to do it without a recipe and then you look up a recipe, would that be you looking up a recipe?
[45:31.910 --> 45:35.290]  I think so. I think without a recipe is eyeballing it, guesswork.
[45:35.630 --> 45:38.510]  Yeah, I don't I don't really remember.
[45:38.690 --> 45:40.350]  I just remember it was like an hour or so.
[45:41.530 --> 45:43.990]  And I thought that seems like a long time to cook a pie.
[45:45.170 --> 45:47.070]  I would have probably gone with 10 minutes.
[45:47.570 --> 45:50.270]  So that would have been a funnier video.
[45:51.070 --> 45:55.550]  Oh, by the way, a tremendous amount of comments suggesting what we call the crouton thing.
[45:55.550 --> 45:56.750]  Have you seen it? No.
[45:56.950 --> 45:57.750]  No. What do they call it?
[45:58.010 --> 45:58.810]  The crouton.
[45:59.650 --> 46:00.910]  Oh, oh, crouton.
[46:01.030 --> 46:01.790]  That's fun.
[46:02.010 --> 46:03.310]  Very smart comment leavers.
[46:04.030 --> 46:04.750]  Gracie's excited.
[46:05.050 --> 46:07.390]  I think she's procured all of the croutons.
[46:07.510 --> 46:08.970]  So that'll be a crouton eating contest.
[46:09.130 --> 46:11.710]  And then also we're making sandwiches.
[46:12.310 --> 46:14.070]  We're going to make the regulation sandwiches.
[46:14.250 --> 46:15.270]  So it's going to be a lot.
[46:15.450 --> 46:17.790]  It's going to be a lot tomorrow, but we're going to have the stuff.
[46:17.950 --> 46:19.090]  And I'm going to bring a blindfold.
[46:20.150 --> 46:23.670]  So we'll have cosmic crisp apples and we'll see what happens.
[46:23.670 --> 46:27.290]  Why do you think Gracie is so much more excited by the croutons than the table thing?
[46:27.710 --> 46:28.110]  The desk thing?
[46:28.610 --> 46:29.570]  She is a food freak.
[46:30.410 --> 46:31.430]  She's a freaky food person.
[46:32.110 --> 46:34.950]  You know, I've been thinking about I've been thinking about Gracie bowing out
[46:34.950 --> 46:37.830]  with the with the migraine all of a sudden, and I think I know what happened.
[46:38.110 --> 46:38.790]  Oh, yeah.
[46:39.050 --> 46:40.990]  Between recordings, she slacked me
[46:42.090 --> 46:44.330]  and asked me the dog's name and I told her.
[46:44.770 --> 46:48.190]  I think her brain can't handle the knowledge.
[46:48.350 --> 46:49.290]  And it's it's bursting.
[46:49.730 --> 46:50.470]  It's bursting. You overloaded her?
[46:50.950 --> 46:51.990]  I think I overloaded her.
[46:51.990 --> 46:55.090]  Yeah. She cheated at knowing the dog's name.
[46:55.590 --> 46:56.490]  Now, she didn't.
[46:56.550 --> 46:59.090]  She just asked me the dog's name and I have no quarrel with her.
[46:59.370 --> 47:00.690]  So I told her the dog's name.
[47:00.910 --> 47:03.590]  I guess me just drawing conclusions there.
[47:03.730 --> 47:05.370]  Right, right, right. Yeah, right.
[47:05.430 --> 47:07.510]  Whoops. And and now her brain hurts
[47:09.570 --> 47:11.050]  because the name is so good.
[47:11.370 --> 47:14.470]  I don't know, but it's got me scared to ever tell you guys names.
[47:14.550 --> 47:15.430]  I don't want to hurt your brains.
[47:16.010 --> 47:18.130]  Oh, we weren't learning it anyway, so it's fine.
[47:18.610 --> 47:19.330]  It's excellent point.
[47:19.370 --> 47:21.450]  I've almost learned it like three times now.
[47:21.450 --> 47:25.930]  But when I was playing trucks, it was almost sad.
[47:26.030 --> 47:29.610]  And Geoff had to go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[47:29.730 --> 47:32.170]  Calm down. Luckily, yeah.
[47:34.410 --> 47:37.570]  So when I was out of it last time we recorded,
[47:37.670 --> 47:40.290]  I think we talked about fruits and rebranding fruits.
[47:40.490 --> 47:43.430]  Oh, right. That was the whole thing that we're talking about.
[47:43.530 --> 47:47.790]  Did we? Oh, Gavin just posted a photo of his regret time on his end.
[47:47.790 --> 47:52.250]  Yeah, it is once again the exact same time that has been said two times previous.
[47:52.530 --> 47:56.950]  It is still 18 minutes, 38 against 1254.
[47:57.310 --> 47:59.310]  Can I go and look on my other Xbox?
[48:00.110 --> 48:01.470]  Do whatever makes you happy.
[48:01.890 --> 48:05.970]  So Andrew got that time with zero deaths and you got it
[48:05.970 --> 48:08.810]  six minutes slower with 21 deaths. Is that what I'm reading?
[48:09.710 --> 48:12.870]  Yeah, I got new techniques.
[48:15.610 --> 48:16.790]  He's working on it.
[48:17.390 --> 48:18.530]  Huh. You know, the game plan.
[48:18.790 --> 48:21.550]  I'm a but boron. Sorry, Kara.
[48:22.390 --> 48:25.890]  Oh, why are what's one of the times you do have them beat at?
[48:26.010 --> 48:28.030]  And then let's let's have it. That be it.
[48:28.390 --> 48:31.750]  I just feel like he really took the wind out of the sails of what was happening.
[48:31.870 --> 48:32.930]  I think we got to wait a week.
[48:33.190 --> 48:36.430]  I burnt down my sails because I'm about it. I just.
[48:37.670 --> 48:39.370]  I have 11 minutes, 28.
[48:40.170 --> 48:44.030]  I just want to point out that that image is titled shitballs dot JPEG.
[48:46.210 --> 48:47.710]  I didn't think that showed up,
[48:49.310 --> 48:52.190]  but we're talking about fruit, rebranding fruit.
[48:52.390 --> 48:55.310]  What is a fruit that needs a rebrand, a less popular fruit?
[48:55.630 --> 48:57.070]  So I did some reconnaissance.
[48:57.150 --> 49:01.570]  I did some research into this to see which fruit we could potentially assist.
[49:01.690 --> 49:03.050]  Who needs a refresh?
[49:03.290 --> 49:05.870]  And I'm going to be honest, I was pretty shocked by my results.
[49:06.230 --> 49:08.170]  I tried to figure out, like, what is a way?
[49:08.290 --> 49:11.770]  I originally just Googled popular, least popular fruit.
[49:11.770 --> 49:13.930]  And that was not that was not helpful.
[49:14.270 --> 49:15.950]  There was not a lot of data I could gather.
[49:16.350 --> 49:20.470]  So the best point of research I could think of to come up with was I went on Walmart
[49:20.470 --> 49:24.370]  because I figured there's Walmarts essentially everywhere and they have an online store
[49:24.370 --> 49:29.130]  and you could filter by sold, like most sold to least sold, essentially.
[49:29.670 --> 49:31.010]  And I was shocked to learn.
[49:31.110 --> 49:34.870]  So I did my local area first that the least popular
[49:34.870 --> 49:40.130]  that is like a specific branded fruit is none other than.
[49:41.050 --> 49:42.130]  The Bartlett pear.
[49:42.790 --> 49:45.450]  It was fourth on the list, but the rest were kind of generic.
[49:45.590 --> 49:46.270]  The Bartlett pear.
[49:46.350 --> 49:49.330]  I did not expect a pear to be so low on the list.
[49:49.710 --> 49:50.570]  Bananas below it.
[49:50.650 --> 49:54.650]  But I think that's just like a cost thing as opposed to quality of the fruit.
[49:54.690 --> 49:56.430]  And also banana doesn't need a rebrand.
[49:56.550 --> 49:57.830]  Everyone knows banana. It's an iconic.
[49:57.970 --> 50:02.570]  It's a staple when you think of fruit in a way that I guess a pear isn't a pear.
[50:02.910 --> 50:05.930]  I feel you could really say it's like the John Hawks of fruits,
[50:05.930 --> 50:08.910]  as I guess maybe when I compare it to bring a full circle.
[50:09.440 --> 50:11.970]  But then I thought, well, maybe because it's my local store,
[50:12.390 --> 50:14.690]  maybe it's just my area and I live in a smaller place.
[50:14.710 --> 50:17.650]  So I went to I found a Walmart in Toronto,
[50:17.810 --> 50:19.750]  one of the largest populated areas in Canada.
[50:20.050 --> 50:22.150]  Same thing. Same exact placement.
[50:22.350 --> 50:24.110]  Bartlett pear, bottom four.
[50:24.890 --> 50:27.250]  And then I went to another one.
[50:27.450 --> 50:29.150]  And once again, same results.
[50:29.190 --> 50:31.350]  We got the Bartlett struggling in the back.
[50:31.450 --> 50:34.310]  The Bartlett needs some assistance is what I'm gathering.
[50:34.710 --> 50:37.010]  So maybe if we want to try to think of a rebrand for Bartlett,
[50:37.010 --> 50:38.510]  you want to zimmer the Bartlett?
[50:38.910 --> 50:40.490]  I think we could zimmer the Bartlett.
[50:40.630 --> 50:43.370]  I think we could maybe adjust the value, bring it popularity.
[50:44.090 --> 50:45.370]  I did send.
[50:45.750 --> 50:47.770]  I think you have really nailed it.
[50:47.850 --> 50:50.150]  I think the pear is the perfect fruit to try to resurrect
[50:50.770 --> 50:52.810]  or try to to refresh their image.
[50:53.650 --> 50:55.550]  It's a solid fruit.
[50:55.710 --> 50:56.790]  It's a unique fruit.
[50:57.030 --> 50:58.650]  It's an overlooked fruit.
[50:59.910 --> 51:02.110]  Yeah, so I was I was trying to think of like
[51:02.570 --> 51:06.150]  find the equivalent, essentially, of the cosmic crisp to like reach out to you,
[51:06.150 --> 51:07.710]  to give them our assistance.
[51:07.890 --> 51:11.670]  And I found a website that's called like Pear USA dot com.
[51:12.090 --> 51:16.250]  And they seem to be like just the generic like we're the pear people.
[51:16.530 --> 51:17.910]  We got pear information.
[51:18.790 --> 51:21.330]  So the evening I was incredibly sick and out of it.
[51:21.850 --> 51:25.930]  I wrote them and I wrote them in a rather unhinged email,
[51:26.090 --> 51:28.830]  I would say, about pears at two a.m.
[51:28.890 --> 51:31.010]  And I will post that into the thing.
[51:31.530 --> 51:33.290]  And they have not replied to this email.
[51:33.790 --> 51:37.150]  The email reads, Hey, I hope you have an awesome day.
[51:37.210 --> 51:38.390]  No, mind this random email.
[51:38.510 --> 51:39.350]  I just wanted to.
[51:39.790 --> 51:41.390]  Nope, that's the wrong thing.
[51:41.510 --> 51:48.770]  That is that is unrelated to what that is.
[51:48.970 --> 51:52.410]  Yeah. Oh, crazy that it started with.
[51:52.510 --> 51:55.070]  Hey, that really took the wind out of your sails.
[51:55.230 --> 51:55.890]  Yeah, I sure did.
[51:55.990 --> 51:56.970]  I gave it it.
[51:57.030 --> 51:58.290]  I'm you got to regret.
[51:58.770 --> 52:02.050]  Eric, you you got any bitch you want to fuck up real fast?
[52:02.050 --> 52:02.990]  No, I'm good.
[52:03.330 --> 52:04.410]  I'm going for the ride.
[52:04.490 --> 52:05.070]  Here we go. Here we go.
[52:05.210 --> 52:05.810]  Yeah. Hello.
[52:06.410 --> 52:07.050]  My name is David.
[52:07.370 --> 52:09.690]  I'm an avid fruit connoisseur.
[52:10.150 --> 52:12.930]  I have a real passion for fruit and I'm constantly doing research
[52:12.930 --> 52:17.130]  into the industry, specifically in the areas of popularity and sales.
[52:17.490 --> 52:20.810]  I think seeing what fruit grabs the attention of the public at various times
[52:20.810 --> 52:22.970]  to be both insightful and incredibly informative.
[52:23.630 --> 52:26.930]  In my most recent round of research, I have uncovered something
[52:26.930 --> 52:29.890]  that I found deeply disturbing in regards to the Bartlett pear.
[52:30.430 --> 52:33.430]  My data has led me to realize that the Bartlett is one of the worst
[52:33.430 --> 52:35.270]  selling fruits across all of Canada.
[52:35.850 --> 52:38.290]  I didn't know who drew alert, but upon discovering this site,
[52:38.550 --> 52:41.470]  it seems that you are the leading authority on pears in North America.
[52:42.010 --> 52:43.130]  Being the lead authority.
[52:43.510 --> 52:46.390]  I'm sure you're well aware of the struggle of the Bartlett,
[52:46.590 --> 52:48.690]  but I'm curious how you feel about all this.
[52:49.090 --> 52:50.750]  Why aren't Canadians buying the Bartlett?
[52:50.950 --> 52:52.090]  Does it need a rebrand?
[52:52.490 --> 52:55.130]  I have some reports that the Bartlett might be discontinued
[52:55.130 --> 52:56.470]  and phased out in the next few years.
[52:56.730 --> 52:59.590]  What are your thoughts and do you think the Bartlett could bounce back?
[52:59.890 --> 53:01.290]  I hate to lose a classic pear.
[53:01.770 --> 53:03.050]  All the best, Andrew Payton.
[53:04.190 --> 53:08.350]  You're the perfect mix of like intriguing and condescending.
[53:08.710 --> 53:10.530]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[53:12.230 --> 53:13.830]  So I have not heard from them.
[53:13.950 --> 53:17.270]  I also reached out to a local independent grocery store
[53:17.890 --> 53:21.230]  just to see if they'd be willing to discuss sales of fruits
[53:21.230 --> 53:24.650]  and maybe what what in the local see if their data matches with mine.
[53:25.010 --> 53:26.670]  Haven't heard back from them either.
[53:26.870 --> 53:28.690]  So a lot of stuff is pending.
[53:28.690 --> 53:33.030]  But I do think that we could maybe come up with a rebrand for the Bartlett.
[53:33.130 --> 53:34.310]  I have an idea for you.
[53:34.630 --> 53:35.670]  I have an idea for you.
[53:36.010 --> 53:37.370]  What do people want in a pear?
[53:37.610 --> 53:38.730]  What do people want in a fruit?
[53:38.850 --> 53:40.010]  They want to feel cool.
[53:40.010 --> 53:40.790]  They want to look cool.
[53:40.830 --> 53:41.510]  They want to be cool.
[53:41.570 --> 53:42.830]  They want fruit to be cool, right?
[53:43.310 --> 53:44.830]  What's cooler than rock and roll?
[53:44.930 --> 53:45.570]  What's cooler?
[53:46.010 --> 53:47.410]  What's the coolest form of rock and roll?
[53:47.570 --> 53:48.530]  Punk rock and roll, right?
[53:49.090 --> 53:52.650]  There is an incredibly popular punk band named Pears.
[53:53.030 --> 53:55.490]  They're they're like a major punk band.
[53:56.830 --> 53:57.550]  They're huge.
[53:58.510 --> 54:01.910]  They they're they're like at the top of the game right now in the punk world
[54:02.330 --> 54:04.430]  in terms of like respect and popularity.
[54:04.770 --> 54:06.530]  And here's what I think you do.
[54:06.670 --> 54:08.170]  I think you reach out to the band Pears.
[54:08.630 --> 54:10.750]  You get them on board, say this is your namesake.
[54:10.950 --> 54:12.610]  Pears are taking a beating in Canada.
[54:13.190 --> 54:14.950]  We need to cool up Pears a little bit.
[54:15.190 --> 54:19.590]  Maybe you can convince them to write like a new jingle or a new theme song for Pears.
[54:20.250 --> 54:21.450]  That's a great idea, Geoff.
[54:21.550 --> 54:24.070]  I'm going as soon as we're done here, I'm pursuing this lead.
[54:24.650 --> 54:25.950]  And I will get back to you.
[54:25.950 --> 54:29.110]  Maybe they could perform a Pear benefit concert in Canada.
[54:29.610 --> 54:30.550]  It's entirely possible.
[54:30.670 --> 54:31.490]  They're on fat records.
[54:31.610 --> 54:32.930]  If you want to reach out to the record label.
[54:33.490 --> 54:34.170]  Live Pear.
[54:35.830 --> 54:39.790]  Donations to save the Pears, something like that, like a like a telethon type thing.
[54:39.850 --> 54:40.670]  Is that what you're thinking, Gavin?
[54:42.130 --> 54:44.050]  Yeah. Yeah, just something that people go to.
[54:44.230 --> 54:49.010]  I mean, you sounded you suggested the idea and then you sounded like I invented it
[54:49.010 --> 54:50.250]  and I'm throwing it on to you.
[54:50.330 --> 54:51.790]  You seem very unconfident about it.
[54:51.790 --> 54:53.130]  Well, I was just thinking more like Live Aid.
[54:54.130 --> 54:55.790]  Yeah, that's the exact point.
[54:55.950 --> 54:58.130]  OK, that's the comparison.
[54:58.550 --> 55:00.270]  OK, do people call into that?
[55:01.190 --> 55:01.850]  I don't know.
[55:02.130 --> 55:05.630]  I just want somebody to say that Gavin Frey doesn't like Pears
[55:05.630 --> 55:07.990]  on like a segment, like a charity thing.
[55:10.490 --> 55:11.890]  Pears are below Apple for me.
[55:13.450 --> 55:14.950]  And where's Apple on the grand scale?
[55:15.830 --> 55:16.810]  Five, six out of ten.
[55:17.710 --> 55:20.890]  Yeah, but what if you saw a pear with a mohawk and a leather jacket
[55:20.890 --> 55:22.710]  with studs on it with a guitar?
[55:22.710 --> 55:23.850]  You might feel a little different.
[55:24.510 --> 55:25.750]  I don't think I'd eat it.
[55:25.790 --> 55:26.690]  Would you eat that pear?
[55:27.070 --> 55:29.190]  I might be too scared to, but I'd be intrigued.
[55:29.930 --> 55:33.450]  I think I think if you really want to get to the bottom of what's up with pears,
[55:33.530 --> 55:36.310]  you have to find all the problems that people have with pears
[55:36.310 --> 55:38.350]  and then try to solve those problems.
[55:38.650 --> 55:41.370]  I always underestimate the slippage of a pear.
[55:42.610 --> 55:46.630]  Hmm. I think the problem people have with a pear is its actual strength.
[55:46.710 --> 55:48.230]  People say a pear is too sandy.
[55:48.670 --> 55:51.270]  I think that's I think that's I think that's the nice part about it.
[55:51.330 --> 55:52.590]  No other fruit is sandy like a pear.
[55:52.590 --> 55:55.310]  Yeah, I don't mind the grit, but sometimes you can take a bite
[55:55.310 --> 55:56.830]  and it will just shoot down your throat.
[56:00.790 --> 56:03.390]  I'm trying to handle the cut open part of the pear.
[56:03.850 --> 56:04.710]  It's very slippery.
[56:05.150 --> 56:07.310]  Cut peaches will do the same thing. Super slippery.
[56:08.130 --> 56:11.450]  What if you like here's another one because pears are naturally gritty.
[56:11.630 --> 56:13.690]  What if you worked out where you could like eat it?
[56:13.730 --> 56:17.430]  And like if you're a construction dude or a woodworker, you can like eat
[56:17.430 --> 56:19.830]  and then sand a little bit of wood and then eat from the other side
[56:20.250 --> 56:20.770]  a little bit.
[56:20.870 --> 56:23.850]  And you can show that like a pear can be a workplace tool and a snack.
[56:24.090 --> 56:26.590]  I like that. That's an innovative idea.
[56:27.070 --> 56:29.730]  What is the most disturbing fruit skinned?
[56:30.390 --> 56:35.430]  Oh, Jesus. Oh, I think a grape looks really fucking weird skinned, dude.
[56:37.250 --> 56:38.090]  Yeah, a grape does.
[56:38.310 --> 56:41.790]  That is something like a pomegranate because it wouldn't really hold together.
[56:42.410 --> 56:43.450]  That's what I was about to ask.
[56:43.490 --> 56:44.830]  Is it with its held shape?
[56:45.210 --> 56:48.950]  I think if you can skin it and hold its shape, that's a bonus.
[56:48.950 --> 56:51.290]  But I mean, there's surely some that you can't do that with.
[56:51.590 --> 56:55.750]  I think I would be alarmed to see a watermelon skinned just hanging out.
[56:56.650 --> 56:58.030]  Yeah, just a big red ball.
[56:58.530 --> 57:00.050]  Yeah, just a red ball.
[57:00.430 --> 57:05.550]  Dragon fruit. It's got the it's so yeah, it's so crazy on the outside
[57:05.550 --> 57:08.350]  and then you peel it and it's just white with little seed
[57:08.350 --> 57:10.050]  like speckled seeds all through.
[57:10.170 --> 57:12.090]  It's just not it's a total opposite.
[57:12.290 --> 57:12.850]  It's very weird.
[57:13.290 --> 57:15.230]  It's the Scooby-Doo villain of fruits.
[57:15.610 --> 57:18.410]  It's you get your hands on it and you look what's under the hood
[57:18.410 --> 57:20.850]  and it's not at all what is presenting itself to be.
[57:21.490 --> 57:22.390]  It's completely different.
[57:22.910 --> 57:23.790]  Kiwi would look cool.
[57:24.470 --> 57:25.390]  Yeah, Kiwi would look cool.
[57:25.510 --> 57:27.530]  Has anyone ever skinned a watermelon before?
[57:28.870 --> 57:30.750]  Yeah, I've never seen that.
[57:31.270 --> 57:33.190]  I feel like I've seen videos like an entire.
[57:33.390 --> 57:34.970]  Oh, it looks so cool.
[57:35.850 --> 57:38.790]  I don't think I've seen it, but I just I assume that that has been done
[57:38.790 --> 57:39.410]  countless times.
[57:40.370 --> 57:40.950]  We get a photo.
[57:41.410 --> 57:42.410]  Do this so bad.
[57:42.830 --> 57:43.350]  Maybe we should.
[57:43.850 --> 57:45.230]  Oh, that looks awesome.
[57:45.430 --> 57:46.530]  Doesn't that look awesome?
[57:46.530 --> 57:49.270]  It looks like a cranberry on steroids.
[57:49.550 --> 57:51.110]  Well, my God, I want to eat that.
[57:51.390 --> 57:55.070]  Eric, can we skin watermelons on Friday, too?
[57:55.250 --> 57:57.470]  We can try. I just don't know how to do our.
[57:57.750 --> 57:59.230]  Well, that's the thing with this season.
[57:59.550 --> 58:01.610]  That can't possibly be that watermelon.
[58:03.170 --> 58:03.910]  Why can't I?
[58:04.110 --> 58:05.370]  Oh, you think it's a fake?
[58:05.510 --> 58:09.550]  I think that's two melons because you can't perfectly scoop out a melon
[58:09.550 --> 58:11.490]  from the green without annihilating it.
[58:11.830 --> 58:13.110]  I think you guys have to find out.
[58:13.170 --> 58:16.090]  I think that is that is the internals of a different melon.
[58:16.090 --> 58:18.430]  And the other the green part is melon board.
[58:18.850 --> 58:19.710]  This is what I think.
[58:19.790 --> 58:20.770]  I think you freeze it.
[58:20.870 --> 58:21.890]  You got to freeze the melon.
[58:21.970 --> 58:23.350]  And I think you could do that.
[58:24.750 --> 58:25.810]  Well, just chisel it off.
[58:26.330 --> 58:28.370]  Yeah, like if you freeze it, I think it will hold.
[58:28.490 --> 58:29.350]  Yeah, like that.
[58:29.710 --> 58:30.950]  Like it looks like a dog's dick.
[58:31.150 --> 58:31.890]  Oh, my God.
[58:32.070 --> 58:33.410]  I want to eat that.
[58:33.650 --> 58:34.110]  So, fuck it.
[58:34.150 --> 58:36.090]  I want to just fucking take bites out of it.
[58:36.190 --> 58:38.450]  Well, let's make one of these melons.
[58:38.610 --> 58:39.950]  I'm getting super into that.
[58:40.150 --> 58:43.450]  That's like a fucking watermelon oyster full of little watermelon pearls.
[58:43.450 --> 58:45.130]  Oh, shit.
[58:45.950 --> 58:49.350]  If you guys don't fuck around with watermelons tomorrow, I'm going to be real mad at you.
[58:49.590 --> 58:50.530]  I'm going to be real disappointed.
[58:50.750 --> 58:52.030]  I'm going to be mad at me, too, man.
[58:52.430 --> 58:54.390]  Goddamn, it was like a giant bean.
[58:55.110 --> 58:57.370]  All right, I'll see what we can do for tomorrow.
[58:57.390 --> 59:00.090]  We should we should do this with all fruit.
[59:00.250 --> 59:01.590]  We should skin one half.
[59:04.810 --> 59:08.870]  Like a kiwi, the green bit of a kiwi sat inside the brown bit of a kiwi.
[59:09.130 --> 59:09.350]  Be amazed.
[59:09.370 --> 59:10.750]  I feel like that's gross.
[59:11.010 --> 59:12.630]  I don't like that when I picture it in my head.
[59:12.630 --> 59:15.810]  The fuzziness and then the I just don't like that blend.
[59:16.590 --> 59:20.010]  The melon, it works because it's a smooth texture on both sides,
[59:20.110 --> 59:20.730]  even though it's harder.
[59:21.010 --> 59:22.450]  But it's I just want to touch it.
[59:22.790 --> 59:25.050]  I bet it's cold in your hands in a good way.
[59:26.490 --> 59:27.250]  You know what I mean?
[59:27.250 --> 59:28.990]  It's like cold and a little wet and heavy.
[59:29.170 --> 59:32.010]  And you just want to like the way bury your face in it.
[59:32.090 --> 59:34.070]  So I just want to eat it so hard.
[59:34.610 --> 59:35.330]  So weird.
[59:35.870 --> 59:37.190]  Eat it so hard.
[59:37.310 --> 59:38.310]  I do. I want so much.
[59:38.410 --> 59:39.770]  I could eat that entire watermelon.
[59:39.950 --> 59:40.570]  I bet like that.
[59:40.570 --> 59:45.030]  Are you going to have it as an appetizer or like a dessert after your croutons?
[59:45.270 --> 59:47.470]  Did my flavor Jake is getting hard right now.
[59:47.590 --> 59:49.170]  All right. That's a big, hot flavor.
[59:49.930 --> 59:51.550]  We got to start wrapping up.
[59:51.630 --> 59:52.270]  This is terrible.
[59:53.130 --> 59:54.130]  Are we already at the end?
[59:54.630 --> 59:55.730]  Yeah. Yeah. Shit.
[59:56.050 --> 59:56.910]  That was a step.
[59:57.270 --> 59:59.930]  I would say I wanted to tell you guys a funny story real fast.
[01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:00.770]  It's real fast. Eric won't mind.
[01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:02.890]  I went and saw Iron Claw the other day with Millie.
[01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:03.630]  He already knows this story.
[01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:04.390]  He's heard it a couple of times.
[01:00:04.650 --> 01:00:07.070]  I went and saw Iron Claw the other day with Millie at the Alamo Drafthouse.
[01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:08.410]  His first movie I've been to in a long time.
[01:00:08.410 --> 01:00:11.630]  And we sat down and they kept showing these Disney and DreamWorks trailers,
[01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:15.070]  which seemed really weird for the Iron Claw, you know?
[01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:19.410]  And then and then the movie came on and they played Iron Giant.
[01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:23.490]  Oh, no, wrong theater.
[01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:25.450]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:26.250]  They fucked up.
[01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:28.190]  They had to stop it.
[01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:29.330]  They got about four minutes in.
[01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:30.330]  They had to stop it.
[01:00:30.490 --> 01:00:32.370]  They had to like change the aspect ratio.
[01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:33.690]  And then they played Iron Claw.
[01:00:33.850 --> 01:00:34.230]  Oh, my God.
[01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:36.030]  Somebody just hit the wrong fucking button.
[01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:37.070]  I guess this is the Alamo.
[01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:38.550]  Yeah, Alamo Village.
[01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:40.630]  They just got like a laptop up there.
[01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:41.930]  They're just playing these on the computer.
[01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:44.330]  Well, I think as Eric was pointing out, they have like a 25th
[01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:46.130]  anniversary thing going on right now.
[01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:48.190]  And like Gus just saw Election.
[01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:50.870]  And I think Iron Giant is one of the 25th anniversary movies.
[01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:53.430]  Just funny that that mistake happened.
[01:00:53.790 --> 01:00:57.190]  That reminds me of the time we went to see a drive-in for Blaine's birthday.
[01:00:57.450 --> 01:01:01.230]  And they accidentally mirrored the iPhone that was playing the film.
[01:01:01.770 --> 01:01:02.350]  Are you serious?
[01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:05.310]  The list of phones on the list of films on the phone.
[01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:06.130]  That's fucking cool.
[01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:09.830]  I thought you were going a completely different way with that,
[01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:12.810]  that you're like, I didn't know Zac Efron was a high school musical kid.
[01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:16.070]  Like when you said Disney stuff, I still thought it was relevant to him.
[01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:16.810]  But you just didn't know.
[01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:19.550]  I thought it was relevant to him, too, because he was in high school musical.
[01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:20.810]  I was like, that's fucking weird.
[01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:23.970]  But I guess that's the throughput.
[01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:28.190]  And they did show like they showed the trailer for the new Planet of the Apes movie.
[01:01:28.350 --> 01:01:29.770]  And so I was like, well, that's a badass movie.
[01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:30.810]  That's kind of cool. That makes sense.
[01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:33.410]  But then it was just like cartoon, cartoon, cartoon, cartoon.
[01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:38.230]  And even I was telling when I was telling Eric and the fucking two dudes
[01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:40.310]  sitting to the left of Millie and I, one of the guys leaned over to me.
[01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:42.050]  He goes, are you here to see Iron Claw?
[01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:43.450]  And I was like, yeah, yeah.
[01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:44.530]  And I was like, I don't know.
[01:01:44.830 --> 01:01:46.810]  And he's like, these are bizarre trailers. Yeah.
[01:01:48.450 --> 01:01:51.350]  That's I guess even the trailers are tied to the thing.
[01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:52.730]  Is Iron Giant a good movie?
[01:01:53.490 --> 01:01:57.010]  Yeah. I mean, I haven't I only watched four minutes of it, but
[01:01:58.850 --> 01:02:00.610]  no, I've seen it before. It's a really good movie.
[01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:02.830]  Vin Diesel is the Iron Giant.
[01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:05.250]  Yeah. Superman.
[01:02:06.050 --> 01:02:08.630]  Yeah, it's good. It's yeah, it's really creative.
[01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:09.450]  My uncle worked on it.
[01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:11.530]  It was really creative and it was it was cool when it came out.
[01:02:11.590 --> 01:02:14.130]  It was I think it still probably holds up pretty well.
[01:02:14.670 --> 01:02:16.210]  Good story. Your uncle sounds cool.
[01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:18.710]  He is a great guy. My uncle's awesome.
[01:02:18.790 --> 01:02:21.570]  He works on all kinds of stuff. He's a visual effects guy.
[01:02:22.850 --> 01:02:24.250]  He's great. Lives in L.A.
[01:02:24.550 --> 01:02:25.370]  It's fantastic.
[01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:27.770]  What does he think of the Corridor Crew?
[01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:31.550]  All of your responses to the Corridor Crew.
[01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:35.950]  All of your responses sounded like he isn't real.
[01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:38.250]  Like you're trying to convince us that you're just like,
[01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:41.270]  I don't know who told you that he's not.
[01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:43.490]  It's he's got a dirt bike.
[01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:47.010]  And sometimes on the weekend, he lets me drive his dirt bike and he drinks beers.
[01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:49.590]  He's really good. He works at Nintendo.
[01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:52.850]  Didn't we think that Eric's brother wasn't real at one point as well?
[01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:55.830]  Why do you have the most unbelievable family?
[01:02:57.370 --> 01:02:59.950]  I don't know. No one buys your family.
[01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:01.370]  I don't know what to tell you.
[01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:02.150]  They're all real.
[01:03:02.590 --> 01:03:04.270]  Where does your uncle land on fruit?
[01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:08.950]  Oh, he's for it. Dude is super pro fruit for sure.
[01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:11.350]  You think he's ever skinned a watermelon before?
[01:03:12.050 --> 01:03:13.690]  Oh, I'll have to give him an ask.
[01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:16.190]  He's a visual effects artist, so he probably thinks visually.
[01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:18.770]  So he's probably he probably had the idea and did it years ago.
[01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:20.890]  He does probably think visually. Yeah.
[01:03:21.310 --> 01:03:25.630]  So let's get a melon and see if Geoff can make that using a single watermelon.
[01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:31.110]  Yeah. I mean, I already I've set it in motion where I think I think we're making it happen.
[01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:33.030]  Should be fine. Should have it tomorrow.
[01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:35.190]  Excellent. Tomorrow's going to be a great day.
[01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:38.770]  That should be some supplemental content coming out down the line.
[01:03:38.890 --> 01:03:41.310]  But do you know what came out as of this recording?
[01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:47.010]  Does it do? Does it do is out now on our YouTube channel and Facepod.com.
[01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:52.390]  Dude, I have to say, I who who cut that trailer for does it do on?
[01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:55.070]  I think that was that might have been Devin. It was really good.
[01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:58.310]  Devin did such a good job at that trailer of escalating
[01:03:58.310 --> 01:04:00.810]  and just making it appear so fucking unhinged.
[01:04:01.310 --> 01:04:03.070]  Which I guess maybe the show is unhinged.
[01:04:03.110 --> 01:04:05.190]  I watch it. A hundred percent is.
[01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:08.590]  And I only watch the one cut that Gavin and I watched it New Year's Eve.
[01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:10.890]  But yeah, just just you and Gavin.
[01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:14.350]  Yeah. It just made me realize how how for that show.
[01:04:14.410 --> 01:04:15.470]  I'm just so long for the ride.
[01:04:15.730 --> 01:04:17.250]  Like Geoff is just a train.
[01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:19.690]  And I just have to hop on and hop off at various points.
[01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:20.510]  He just goes.
[01:04:21.050 --> 01:04:23.610]  And I just have no idea what's going to happen.
[01:04:24.290 --> 01:04:25.230]  Geoff does something.
[01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:28.230]  And I've seen, I think, four or five of these episodes at this point.
[01:04:28.310 --> 01:04:30.270]  But Geoff, you do something and I won't spoil it.
[01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:33.390]  It I think it's the funniest thing I think you've ever done.
[01:04:33.590 --> 01:04:36.970]  And it breaks Gavin in the same way it broke me when watching it.
[01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:41.730]  And it's is it such a simple thing, but it is so fucking funny.
[01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:44.410]  Is it with the cake or with the mask?
[01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:46.650]  It's something different.
[01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:47.890]  It's with a mask.
[01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:50.550]  It's it's it's great.
[01:04:50.650 --> 01:04:51.770]  I can't wait for people to see it.
[01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:53.530]  Well, that's in the trailer, isn't it?
[01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:55.650]  Is it? OK, well, I haven't seen the trailer, but
[01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:58.330]  what you do with that mask?
[01:04:59.290 --> 01:05:00.570]  I don't know how it happens.
[01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:03.850]  I don't know how it happens, but that's what makes it so funny,
[01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:06.710]  is you seem equally shocked by it and then you just leave it.
[01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:07.570]  And it's so funny.
[01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:11.530]  I can't. In the back of my head, I'm trying to understand the math
[01:05:11.530 --> 01:05:15.170]  of how those two things are in place on my own face.
[01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:17.330]  And eventually I just go like, it doesn't hurt.
[01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:18.350]  So I'm just going to keep going.
[01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:21.410]  Have you seen it? Have you seen it since recording it?
[01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:23.490]  No. Let's get a screen.
[01:05:23.570 --> 01:05:25.350]  Let's post a screenshot of it.
[01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:26.870]  It's it's so funny.
[01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:28.390]  I know it's probably going to.
[01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:31.530]  I can't insert that because it'll take a bit, I assume, to get to there.
[01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:33.330]  But it's so funny post.
[01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:36.710]  It's so funny to hear you say that, Gavin, that you're just there for the ride.
[01:05:36.930 --> 01:05:39.010]  I feel like I'm just trying to fill space.
[01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:41.310]  Like when we're there, I'm like, it's like, go with it.
[01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:43.470]  It's like, OK, let's start making something happen.
[01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:46.890]  I'm just trying to make it not quiet when we're doing it.
[01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:51.150]  OK, is it the third episode?
[01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:52.890]  I'm scrubbing through here.
[01:05:53.570 --> 01:05:56.390]  I don't remember. I watched them a little while ago, but oh, my God.
[01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:58.450]  The whole it is really good.
[01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:05.410]  I feel like as we were going to, we're so far away from the original premise
[01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:09.690]  of season one, which I tried to hold really tight with the like
[01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:13.650]  the kind of the character I play in it and then and try to keep it contained.
[01:06:13.850 --> 01:06:16.930]  While this the world kind of gets crazy around us in season two,
[01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:21.470]  I just start giving up and I just like it's just I give up any pretense of it.
[01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:23.450]  It's just like, here's here's how we're going to make a mess.
[01:06:24.030 --> 01:06:25.510]  You keep adjusting your hair,
[01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:27.890]  but there are times where your hair is positioned in a way
[01:06:27.890 --> 01:06:31.150]  that you're like Woody Woodpecker, and it just is so perfect.
[01:06:32.310 --> 01:06:33.970]  That's because it keeps having weird shit in it.
[01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:38.810]  Gavin hits me with ranch dressing five minutes into recording,
[01:06:39.050 --> 01:06:42.230]  and I just smelled ranch dressing for the next day straight
[01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:43.250]  because I did it.
[01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:43.670]  I did it.
[01:06:43.690 --> 01:06:45.430]  I don't do a thing where I just squirt stuff
[01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:48.650]  sort of in your proximate direction without looking where it goes.
[01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:52.130]  And I have no idea how much went on here.
[01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:56.570]  All right, I'm going to post this.
[01:06:56.670 --> 01:07:02.210]  It's also like permission to be as dirty and gross as you want to be
[01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:04.330]  and not feel bad about it for like three hours.
[01:07:04.970 --> 01:07:08.530]  Yeah, I mean, physically, like covered in muck and goo and stuff. Yeah.
[01:07:11.050 --> 01:07:13.010]  That should be the thumbnail, no?
[01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:15.050]  I mean, like, oh, my God.
[01:07:15.050 --> 01:07:20.150]  I don't understand how my nose and my eyeball are both in the eye hole.
[01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:23.370]  It looks like a horrible injury.
[01:07:23.370 --> 01:07:25.090]  Like you've been in a boxing match.
[01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:28.130]  It looks like Jason Voorhees in the second movie with the bag.
[01:07:29.350 --> 01:07:32.290]  Oh, I didn't know my nose could go that far up.
[01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.290]  It's so far away from my mouth.
[01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:36.350]  There's like a whole face between my nose and my mouth.
[01:07:36.730 --> 01:07:40.210]  Like the teeth in the beard is so fucked.
[01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:41.790]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:44.430]  You look like the dudes from the band episode of the X-Files.
[01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:45.510]  Nick is right.
[01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:46.330]  That's absolutely.
[01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:47.710]  You just look fucked.
[01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:49.390]  Oh, my God.
[01:07:50.030 --> 01:07:52.110]  It somehow looks worse from further away.
[01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:55.230]  Well, it's just that's not where a nose goes.
[01:07:55.390 --> 01:07:58.970]  And there's also another nose on the fucking on the mask.
[01:07:59.030 --> 01:08:00.910]  So it's just ultra confusing.
[01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:01.950]  It's perfect.
[01:08:11.890 --> 01:08:12.890]  I can't.
[01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:14.990]  I'm so happy we did it.
[01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:18.710]  And I can't imagine we're going to do a third season of Doesn't Do
[01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:22.110]  unless somebody wants to pay for it, because we're just it's so hard
[01:08:22.110 --> 01:08:23.970]  to come up with fucking products.
[01:08:24.210 --> 01:08:26.390]  And even like I don't want to get into the whole fight again,
[01:08:26.490 --> 01:08:31.290]  but even like three of the products we did in this season, we said no to.
[01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:33.710]  But somehow we ended up doing them, which is fine.
[01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:36.850]  Which is because I don't want to start the fight.
[01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:38.890]  Well, they don't fucking bring it up.
[01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:43.010]  But my point is, is that even those episodes are still really fucking good
[01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:43.990]  and really fun.
[01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:47.210]  But I just like I just don't know that there's enough products out there
[01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:48.030]  to do another season.
[01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:50.990]  I mean, if we find the products, the episodes kind of make themselves.
[01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:52.410]  Yeah, it's just about finding the products.
[01:08:52.570 --> 01:08:55.650]  I like that we've come full circle, by the way, on two noses on the same head.
[01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:59.690]  That's that's great.
[01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:01.790]  That's really that's a really that's a really good point.
[01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:04.630]  Yeah. Which I think was the end of the last episode now.
[01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:07.530]  I think so. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Wow.
[01:09:08.130 --> 01:09:09.370]  So Doesn't Do is out.
[01:09:09.490 --> 01:09:12.290]  You can watch on our YouTube channel and on FacePod dot com.
[01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:13.650]  Whatever works for you.
[01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:16.630]  That's fine. Just watch it and let us know what you think.
[01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:19.210]  And then we should have some more stuff that I don't know
[01:09:19.210 --> 01:09:20.790]  if we're quite talking about yet.
[01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:24.930]  That'll be coming in the next couple of weeks.
[01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:27.330]  Dude, I can't wait till we're talking about it,
[01:09:27.350 --> 01:09:28.850]  because I don't know what the fuck you're on about.
[01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:30.770]  Oh, I do. I'm excited.
[01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:31.750]  What are you on about?
[01:09:32.410 --> 01:09:33.270]  We'll find out.
[01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:35.350]  It comes out. I know it comes out the 31st, Nick.
[01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:36.710]  Is it something I already recorded?
[01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:40.330]  No, no. Oh, it's something that requires travel.
[01:09:40.570 --> 01:09:43.170]  It's yes, it's the thing we're going to go and do
[01:09:43.170 --> 01:09:45.710]  and then come back and continue to do.
[01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:46.290]  Where are we going?
[01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:49.410]  Wow. How do I kick Nick out of here?
[01:09:49.930 --> 01:09:51.570]  OK, but but that's it.
[01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:52.410]  That's the end of the episode.
[01:09:52.530 --> 01:09:53.590]  Now I wrap up the episode.
[01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:56.730]  Can I can I just have like a group agreement that we all think
[01:09:56.730 --> 01:09:58.430]  that Nick hasn't been in the mask yet?
[01:09:58.950 --> 01:10:00.470]  Yeah, I was going to bring it up earlier,
[01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:01.790]  but I don't think he's been in the mask either.
[01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:05.870]  I also don't think he's been in the mask because this this is my quarter.
[01:10:06.130 --> 01:10:07.150]  This is your quarter. That's true.
[01:10:07.410 --> 01:10:08.370]  And I've been keeping an ear out.
[01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:11.530]  Did you guys see that they're discontinuing Fruit Stripe gum?
[01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:13.230]  No. Yeah.
[01:10:13.230 --> 01:10:16.450]  I was excited to see you turn that into a closing thing.
[01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:18.590]  Yeah, I'm really excited for that being the outro.
[01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:20.930]  No, I don't know. I just thought it was interesting that there
[01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:24.910]  it's been around for a million fucking years and they're finally getting rid of it.
[01:10:26.170 --> 01:10:27.730]  So, you know, good set day.
[01:10:27.810 --> 01:10:28.750]  Goodbye to Fruit Stripe gum.
[01:10:28.770 --> 01:10:30.070]  Been around since the 60s.
[01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:31.090]  Like the Choco Taco.
[01:10:31.650 --> 01:10:32.010]  Goodbye.
[01:10:32.190 --> 01:10:34.590]  Well, the 60s was over 50 years ago, so we don't remember it anymore.
[01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:36.430]  That's true. There you go.
[01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:40.710]  It's been around as long as our popular culture's collective memory,
[01:10:40.890 --> 01:10:41.730]  which is only 50 years.
[01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:45.070]  Well, what won't be around is us in 20 seconds.
[01:10:45.250 --> 01:10:45.730]  Goodbye.
[01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:52.130]  Hey, guys. Major League fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:54.010]  I can't believe my eyes.
[01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.330]  That is not enough light.
[01:10:55.690 --> 01:10:57.190]  Where did Lady Bird get her nickname?
[01:10:57.550 --> 01:10:59.090]  Almost time for a crude off.
[01:10:59.470 --> 01:11:00.650]  Andrew has nice shoes.
[01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:03.070]  He did it. The son of a bitch did it.
[01:11:03.390 --> 01:11:05.470]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:11:05.790 --> 01:11:08.430]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
