[00:10.300 --> 00:14.160]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:14.440 --> 00:18.220]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, and with me as always, Andrew Panton from Canada,
[00:18.760 --> 00:20.240]  Gavin Free from England.
[00:20.720 --> 00:20.940]  Hello.
[00:21.280 --> 00:21.800]  Hello.
[00:22.440 --> 00:23.020]  How's everybody doing?
[00:23.320 --> 00:23.760]  Pretty good.
[00:23.840 --> 00:25.160]  Good. Yeah.
[00:25.780 --> 00:28.380]  My long back, I could potentially be in two countries at once.
[00:28.780 --> 00:30.680]  Just depending on border location.
[00:31.680 --> 00:33.480]  Yeah, I guess that's true.
[00:33.840 --> 00:34.720]  Never really considered it that way.
[00:35.080 --> 00:36.260]  Longest back in the company.
[00:37.040 --> 00:37.200]  Verified.
[00:37.200 --> 00:41.220]  I love how we always have to say these hellos for the beginning of the podcast,
[00:41.360 --> 00:45.360]  as if we haven't just been playing Call of Duty and Trucks together
[00:45.360 --> 00:46.540]  for the last hour and a half.
[00:46.540 --> 00:49.200]  Well, that wasn't always the way.
[00:49.600 --> 00:53.820]  Like, in the grand scheme of this show, this is a relatively new event.
[00:53.980 --> 00:54.300]  That's true.
[00:54.520 --> 00:56.880]  We made way more episodes where we weren't doing that,
[00:57.020 --> 00:59.280]  as opposed to now, where that is a reality,
[00:59.420 --> 01:01.360]  where we do Let's Plays and then record the show a little bit later.
[01:01.560 --> 01:02.260]  That's a very good point.
[01:02.700 --> 01:06.240]  Yeah, we used to have, like, 14-day gaps between recordings sometimes,
[01:06.240 --> 01:08.060]  and now we can barely go 14 minutes.
[01:08.980 --> 01:12.660]  There's a time in which there would be one piece of f***face content per week,
[01:12.720 --> 01:14.100]  and that seems insane now.
[01:14.280 --> 01:15.460]  But it was that long ago.
[01:21.420 --> 01:25.760]  What's new in y'all's lives in the last 25 minutes or so since we last spoke?
[01:26.620 --> 01:28.360]  Oh, I have a new thing that I need to talk about.
[01:28.600 --> 01:30.680]  This is a big deal.
[01:30.800 --> 01:32.840]  It's coming in hot. Like, last 25 minutes hot.
[01:33.080 --> 01:35.580]  No, this isn't. I've been sitting on this for a little bit.
[01:35.580 --> 01:38.780]  Oh my God, what I just did was genius, and it was a total accident.
[01:39.720 --> 01:42.360]  I got a new chair! We got a chair!
[01:42.780 --> 01:43.040]  What?
[01:43.320 --> 01:46.380]  It has finally happened. A chair.
[01:46.960 --> 01:47.940]  Thank you, Eric.
[01:49.720 --> 01:51.680]  Tell us what happened. When? How is it?
[01:51.680 --> 01:51.960]  Okay.
[01:52.080 --> 01:52.800]  Show us a picture.
[01:53.340 --> 01:56.140]  Yeah, I'm gonna... Listen, we're going through all of it. This is a huge deal.
[01:56.400 --> 01:59.060]  It's an amazing chair. I can't wait to get it.
[02:00.160 --> 02:07.400]  So this, Geoff, you wrote a fantastic pitch email for me to go around and send people with.
[02:07.740 --> 02:13.500]  We went through that for a while, and ultimately that didn't work, shockingly, as much as I loved it.
[02:14.280 --> 02:19.760]  We had one person reply, and then they were like, okay, I'll bite. Who's your client?
[02:20.020 --> 02:23.100]  And then I explained who the client was, and I never heard from them again.
[02:23.100 --> 02:29.500]  However, we, thankfully, have some amazing listeners.
[02:30.280 --> 02:38.180]  And a guy goes by I'm Goopsy on Twitter, he works for Hi-Rez, the company that makes Smite.
[02:38.740 --> 02:45.040]  He reached out to me, and he said, hey, I love the show, listen to it, I know you're doing this chair thing.
[02:45.500 --> 02:48.000]  I have a connection with somebody at Herman Miller.
[02:48.000 --> 02:54.080]  If you want, I could try to bridge the gap between you two and see if there's something that could be worked out.
[02:55.380 --> 03:02.140]  He wrote one of the nicest emails. The way he hyped up our show and just presented it was incredible.
[03:02.640 --> 03:06.820]  I couldn't have done a better job as someone who's involved. I was blown away. I was like, wow, we sound great.
[03:07.120 --> 03:08.280]  This is a great bridge email.
[03:08.760 --> 03:14.100]  To be fair, if you asked me to pick from all the chair brands that I would want a chair from, I'd go straight to Herman Miller.
[03:14.100 --> 03:18.100]  Yeah, that's the chair. I mean, that's like the fucking chair.
[03:18.280 --> 03:21.860]  It is the top of the line chair. I've heard nothing but amazing things.
[03:22.100 --> 03:25.100]  It's like when you think watch, you think Rolex, right?
[03:25.220 --> 03:25.600]  Exactly.
[03:25.900 --> 03:27.420]  When you think chair, you think Herman Miller.
[03:28.640 --> 03:36.140]  So I couldn't, first of all, I never dreamed that a chair so prestigious could be in the scenario for the pitch email.
[03:36.140 --> 03:44.840]  But thankfully, due to the goopsy, he reached out, bridged it, and it's phenomenal.
[03:44.960 --> 03:46.660]  Let me get a photo of what this chair is.
[03:47.200 --> 03:53.480]  But they're going to send one, and I have zero doubts that this thing is going to last more than a year, which is huge.
[03:54.120 --> 03:58.160]  You need to let us know when your ass first touches it because I'm going to start a year-long timer.
[03:58.620 --> 03:58.980]  I will.
[03:59.220 --> 03:59.740]  Oh my god, yeah.
[03:59.740 --> 04:06.480]  I was thinking about maybe in like Let's Play having a little chair pop up in the bottom right of like how many videos the chair made it through.
[04:06.760 --> 04:13.180]  Dude, we got, I think you need to record yourself sitting in it for the first time on the show.
[04:14.040 --> 04:14.100]  Yes.
[04:14.100 --> 04:23.340]  And either you do it for the first time in a recording or you record yourself sitting in it for the first time and then we can all talk about it.
[04:23.420 --> 04:24.940]  I'm so excited for you to get this chair.
[04:25.060 --> 04:26.040]  I'm so excited.
[04:26.440 --> 04:28.180]  We need you to record your first sitting.
[04:28.180 --> 04:31.380]  Oh, that's going to be like sitting on a cushion of air.
[04:31.480 --> 04:31.940]  Look at that.
[04:32.060 --> 04:33.400]  Oh, it's going to be amazing.
[04:33.540 --> 04:34.140]  I can't wait.
[04:34.260 --> 04:35.160]  It just got sent out.
[04:35.760 --> 04:38.120]  This motherfucker might never stand again.
[04:41.380 --> 04:45.460]  What if I like attach the chair to my ass at all?
[04:45.520 --> 04:49.380]  Like I have to walk hunched over just so I could sit whenever I need to with her.
[04:49.880 --> 04:52.860]  Your stories are going to start now from now on.
[04:52.940 --> 04:55.420]  So I rolled into a Swift and wet chair box.
[04:57.580 --> 05:00.060]  That injury would have never happened in that scenario.
[05:01.840 --> 05:02.760]  I'm just so excited.
[05:02.880 --> 05:03.960]  I had to give the update on it.
[05:04.020 --> 05:05.340]  I'll let you guys know when it comes in.
[05:05.840 --> 05:08.220]  Dude, can I give you a sign of warning?
[05:08.360 --> 05:17.480]  I know that's not your house, that photo, but because that's a mesh back, if you have any tall cactuses against the wall, I just wouldn't lean back too far.
[05:18.560 --> 05:22.180]  That looks like a catastrophe waiting to happen in that photo.
[05:22.180 --> 05:27.020]  After tripping on the sushi container and then the Swiffer box, I was cactus free.
[05:27.180 --> 05:29.740]  I would be a crazy person to have a cactus around.
[05:30.820 --> 05:38.500]  We should all have to put a cactus in the vicinity of our computer.
[05:39.040 --> 05:43.620]  And we all have to have them there until the first person gets a prick.
[05:43.960 --> 05:45.400]  I hate cactus so much.
[05:45.460 --> 05:48.640]  There's one that I keep brushing my hand on.
[05:49.160 --> 05:52.800]  I'd probably do this every six months near where I live.
[05:52.860 --> 05:54.600]  I keep just accidentally tapping my hand on it.
[05:54.780 --> 05:57.780]  It's like a week of swelling and pulling out.
[05:58.000 --> 06:00.040]  And you gotta wait for it all to come to the surface.
[06:00.180 --> 06:00.840]  It's horrible.
[06:01.460 --> 06:04.560]  What? You hate cactus? I love cactus.
[06:05.080 --> 06:06.260]  Do you like putting your hand in it?
[06:06.840 --> 06:08.640]  I don't put my hand in a cactus.
[06:08.840 --> 06:09.520]  I didn't do it on purpose.
[06:10.480 --> 06:13.800]  It sounds like you're doing it on accident way too frequently.
[06:14.060 --> 06:15.660]  It leans out into the street.
[06:16.660 --> 06:19.360]  The cactus is leaning out to get you?
[06:19.880 --> 06:22.200]  Yeah, like I'm walking home. I've got my bags.
[06:22.420 --> 06:25.240]  And it's reaching out to grab you like a stranger danger?
[06:26.180 --> 06:26.620]  Jesus.
[06:27.960 --> 06:29.860]  Gracie's right. I'm sure you could go around it.
[06:30.060 --> 06:31.640]  I 100% agree with Gracie.
[06:31.640 --> 06:33.220]  Yeah, into the road I could go around it.
[06:34.740 --> 06:37.180]  So your idea is to go through the cactus?
[06:38.060 --> 06:40.560]  Well, I like to shimmy and split the difference.
[06:40.620 --> 06:41.920]  But sometimes it just brushes me.
[06:42.760 --> 06:48.260]  If we ever wanted to trap Gavin, we'd just circle cactuses around his house and never be able to leave.
[06:48.460 --> 06:51.780]  Gracie says no chance it covers the entire width of the sidewalk.
[06:52.660 --> 06:53.540]  I bet it does.
[06:53.920 --> 06:54.960]  I bet it does.
[06:55.420 --> 06:59.980]  Also, surrounding Gavin's home with cactuses wouldn't stop him.
[07:00.040 --> 07:03.500]  He would just walk through it and then go, oh, I have to walk through these cactus every day.
[07:05.320 --> 07:08.760]  Yeah, that's true. He would just be more swollen than usual all the time.
[07:11.920 --> 07:13.660]  Man, you should stay the fuck away from New Mexico.
[07:15.200 --> 07:21.580]  What was sharper, the cactus or your asshole hairs in the regrowing since the waxing?
[07:21.660 --> 07:23.100]  You're saying they're prickly.
[07:23.260 --> 07:23.920]  Let's get an update.
[07:25.260 --> 07:26.300]  Cactus is much worse.
[07:27.240 --> 07:36.240]  But I will say the urchin in the shitball little beach water we were in, way worse than all of it.
[07:37.480 --> 07:44.600]  If I had if I had urchin spines in between my ass cheeks, I would probably lose the will to live.
[07:45.000 --> 07:50.260]  Dude, do you think surely somebody has had urchin spikes in their ass cheeks?
[07:50.400 --> 07:51.180]  Someone's done it.
[07:51.280 --> 07:53.380]  Like slipped and fell hundred percent.
[07:54.160 --> 07:56.420]  At that point, just put me under and take me to the hospital.
[07:56.800 --> 08:01.960]  I bet somebody who's a regulation listener, a comment leaver for this podcast has experienced that.
[08:02.060 --> 08:03.400]  I bet that's more common than you'd think.
[08:03.840 --> 08:04.820]  Please reach out.
[08:04.820 --> 08:06.160]  What, an urchin going up?
[08:06.900 --> 08:07.240]  Mm hmm.
[08:07.920 --> 08:09.820]  I mean, they were fucking everywhere that day.
[08:10.080 --> 08:13.520]  Anything you put in the water would have got like if you tripped, hands would have got him.
[08:13.660 --> 08:16.120]  He's like it would easily get in your butthole.
[08:18.120 --> 08:19.860]  Speaking of butthole, let me prep.
[08:20.300 --> 08:22.380]  I saw a tick tock the other day.
[08:22.560 --> 08:29.480]  Do you ever get like the random chiropractors like cracking things or whatever on people?
[08:29.720 --> 08:30.180]  I've seen it.
[08:30.660 --> 08:32.720]  Yeah, I had one of those pop up.
[08:32.720 --> 08:40.340]  And the guy went deeper into someone's ass than I've ever seen anyone go for the crack.
[08:40.460 --> 08:45.500]  It's just it was a dude just laying down on a table and he went right in his ass.
[08:45.580 --> 08:45.960]  Here we go.
[08:46.320 --> 08:46.760]  I'm sending it.
[08:46.860 --> 08:47.740]  Was he popping crack?
[08:47.880 --> 08:49.740]  He was like popping the tailbone.
[08:49.880 --> 08:52.580]  But he went he like from the inside, right?
[08:52.760 --> 08:59.700]  The butthole to like leverage the position like he needed a hook on it.
[08:59.700 --> 09:02.340]  So like he's thumbing the butthole for stabilization.
[09:03.640 --> 09:08.000]  Listen, I've never seen anyone go deeper in a butthole for medical purposes.
[09:08.520 --> 09:10.920]  That includes like getting a colonoscopy.
[09:11.340 --> 09:13.340]  You should come with me to the doctor, dude.
[09:13.660 --> 09:16.200]  No, this is here. Let me send a posting it right now.
[09:16.760 --> 09:22.860]  And I saw it. And the first thing I wondered is, would you rather have this happen to you or get your ass waxed again?
[09:23.120 --> 09:23.800]  Let me look at this.
[09:24.320 --> 09:26.160]  Ass waxed or ass cracked.
[09:26.640 --> 09:28.680]  It is it's the first like five seconds of video.
[09:28.680 --> 09:30.760]  He goes so goddamn deep.
[09:30.980 --> 09:31.620]  That's crazy.
[09:31.620 --> 09:32.920]  It's insane.
[09:33.040 --> 09:34.240]  They shouldn't post this.
[09:35.040 --> 09:35.860]  This shouldn't be.
[09:36.280 --> 09:37.520]  They shouldn't post this video.
[09:37.820 --> 09:38.260]  That's outrageous.
[09:38.260 --> 09:40.260]  Although I have to slide a puzzle piece into it.
[09:40.280 --> 09:41.120]  What the hell is this?
[09:41.430 --> 09:44.060]  Dude, there's a Morgan thing covering it up.
[09:44.440 --> 09:44.560]  Oh.
[09:45.940 --> 09:47.860]  That's Andrew. That's outrageous.
[09:48.140 --> 09:49.440]  It is that same list.
[09:49.940 --> 09:51.580]  I was like, what is this?
[09:51.660 --> 09:53.900]  And then he immediately went knuckle deep.
[09:54.200 --> 09:55.320]  And he's like, I gotta go lower.
[09:55.500 --> 09:56.140]  Gotta find that.
[09:58.560 --> 10:00.560]  Those men just had intercourse.
[10:01.940 --> 10:04.420]  That was the deep connection they now have.
[10:04.800 --> 10:05.960]  And the pop is loud.
[10:06.580 --> 10:10.620]  And I immediately just went, would you rather have that happen to you or the ass wax?
[10:11.260 --> 10:13.540]  I think I'd be more scared for the crack.
[10:13.660 --> 10:16.480]  Yeah, I think I'd rather have my asshole waxed than that.
[10:16.820 --> 10:18.760]  The devil you know, you know.
[10:19.520 --> 10:20.620]  No, but that's the thing.
[10:20.700 --> 10:23.080]  It just makes me think of Jackass where he breaks his tailbone.
[10:23.080 --> 10:25.900]  And then I think Ryan Dunn goes, why does he break his tailbone?
[10:25.920 --> 10:27.060]  We don't have tails anymore.
[10:30.740 --> 10:32.120]  This is crazy.
[10:33.540 --> 10:38.620]  I feel like saying that that's a tailbone crack and then the act of it happening to you are two very different things.
[10:38.720 --> 10:41.680]  Like, I could see if the guy was like, you want your tailbone cracked?
[10:41.820 --> 10:45.580]  Him being like, yeah, but then not knowing of like what the grip is.
[10:45.780 --> 10:48.240]  That can't have been an on the fly question.
[10:48.240 --> 10:53.420]  Like she, he surely called the night before and said, I'm going to, I'm going to give you a tailbone.
[10:53.720 --> 10:55.200]  Like you can't just drop that on someone.
[10:55.320 --> 10:56.320]  I would need to have a shower.
[10:56.460 --> 10:57.720]  I need to be prepared for this.
[10:58.480 --> 11:03.520]  It also appears to be the first part of their, their session, which I want that at the end.
[11:03.640 --> 11:08.480]  Like that is, I need time to process everything after that happens to me.
[11:08.480 --> 11:12.560]  I think putting it at the beginning is so smart because it's going to be the most tense you are the entire time,
[11:12.640 --> 11:18.540]  because nothing the rest of the time is going to come fucking close to that guy getting knuckled deep in you.
[11:18.640 --> 11:20.060]  It's the button to loosen you up.
[11:20.220 --> 11:24.660]  It's like those little wooden ragdoll toys where you hit the thing and they all just, all the joints collapse.
[11:27.300 --> 11:28.840]  That's where your collapse button is.
[11:28.900 --> 11:29.080]  Yeah.
[11:32.500 --> 11:37.720]  I, I want a chiropractor to grab me by the feet and shake me like a sheep.
[11:37.720 --> 11:44.880]  So all of my bones crack in like one fail swoop and no one has to like get deep on me.
[11:45.080 --> 11:45.660]  You know what I mean?
[11:45.840 --> 11:48.120]  You want to be like tablecloth whipped by the...
[11:48.120 --> 11:49.160]  Yes, a hundred percent.
[11:49.480 --> 11:53.780]  I think, I think that should be the way you get your bones cracked and then you can just move on.
[11:53.860 --> 11:58.500]  Because otherwise you risk getting a finger way in there.
[11:58.760 --> 12:04.580]  Have you seen the videos of that guy that wraps the rag around people's necks and just like yanks their head up?
[12:04.760 --> 12:05.340]  Oh yeah.
[12:05.340 --> 12:07.980]  Does all these like, I think he calls it the ring dinger.
[12:08.360 --> 12:11.040]  It looks like he's pulling their freaking heads off.
[12:11.140 --> 12:13.720]  Who, who wants that? What's the point?
[12:14.280 --> 12:14.540]  Nobody.
[12:15.080 --> 12:15.980]  I've had it done.
[12:16.820 --> 12:17.300]  You...
[12:17.540 --> 12:17.860]  Why?
[12:18.360 --> 12:22.260]  So a long time, this was like when I was like 12, 21.
[12:22.800 --> 12:32.540]  Uh, I was dating a girl who was going to school to be a chiropractor and she got hired to be like an associate chiropractor or whatever.
[12:32.540 --> 12:37.800]  And I would go in and just get treatments from like the doctor there because she would get it for like free.
[12:37.860 --> 12:39.080]  And she's like, I don't know, you can come and do this.
[12:39.520 --> 12:46.680]  So they have some different machines where you lay down and like they move like a line, like your bones and stuff and get you sort of like loose.
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.640]  And there's one that's like this traction machine that holds you up by your neck on like this wall and everything.
[12:52.260 --> 12:57.020]  And I, I would use it and I'm like, oh, this feels like good, but I don't feel like I'm getting a lot out of it.
[12:57.020 --> 13:03.000]  And I talked to the doctor and he's like, oh, I mean, here's, this is what it's supposed to do.
[13:03.060 --> 13:06.440]  Like, are you fine if we do this? And he had, it wasn't just a towel.
[13:06.580 --> 13:14.180]  It's like a, it's almost like what you would use if you were at Lake Havasu and you were going to shoot water balloons to a different boat.
[13:15.840 --> 13:18.840]  You put your head in it. It just isn't as stretchy.
[13:19.020 --> 13:21.740]  And then you lay there and you breathe out.
[13:21.800 --> 13:24.120]  And a couple of times he's just kind of like shifting you back and forth.
[13:24.120 --> 13:28.500]  And then he pulls you and you feel like you go from 5'9 to 6'2.
[13:28.940 --> 13:32.440]  You feel so tall.
[13:32.740 --> 13:34.000]  It's crazy. It's crazy.
[13:34.140 --> 13:36.480]  I'm pretty sure no one should do that.
[13:36.700 --> 13:38.120]  I think it is dangerous.
[13:39.140 --> 13:42.040]  Like, I think the science on that is not exact.
[13:45.220 --> 13:46.840]  Was that the tallest you ever were though?
[13:47.360 --> 13:49.020]  Uh, no, I felt, I felt taller.
[13:50.920 --> 13:55.580]  Other chiropractic sessions that didn't involve my neck, I felt taller, yeah.
[13:56.560 --> 14:01.360]  I just feel like the older I get, the less I want anybody to touch me for any reason.
[14:02.020 --> 14:02.500]  Yeah.
[14:03.460 --> 14:10.060]  You're not into the guy with the hammer, the big like cartoonishly sized hammer hitting you with the metal peg?
[14:10.500 --> 14:18.160]  No, I mean, if I think about it too much, I'm still kind of bummed out about how many people touched my feet right there around the wedding and the honeymoon.
[14:18.600 --> 14:22.640]  You know, I had that like four different feet, people touched my feet within like a week.
[14:22.780 --> 14:23.840]  It was like, I just don't, yeah.
[14:24.500 --> 14:28.860]  I just don't want, I think, I think every, and please don't take this personally.
[14:29.220 --> 14:30.940]  I think everybody else is gross.
[14:31.300 --> 14:32.520]  No, yeah, that's a fair point.
[14:32.520 --> 14:36.440]  I just don't want to, yeah, I just don't want to touch or be touched, I think.
[14:37.260 --> 14:38.120]  Yeah, that's fine.
[14:38.140 --> 14:38.360]  Yeah.
[14:39.260 --> 14:40.820]  I don't, you want the hammer, Eric?
[14:41.140 --> 14:47.580]  I want every new age thing as much as I can.
[14:47.580 --> 14:52.920]  I've laid there for, like, I've had a Reiki session done.
[14:53.080 --> 14:54.560]  I've aligned my chakras.
[14:54.760 --> 14:56.020]  I want all of it.
[14:56.160 --> 14:58.480]  I don't give people, oh, it's pseudoscience.
[14:58.720 --> 14:59.740]  I don't give a fuck.
[15:00.040 --> 15:00.280]  I want all of it.
[15:00.280 --> 15:02.800]  You need to start vacationing in Sedona, Arizona.
[15:03.140 --> 15:11.780]  Oh, dude, I want to do, I want to do ayahuasca and see if it really is like wiping off bugs from a windshield.
[15:11.780 --> 15:16.200]  And then I'll grow my hair long and just be like a real different kind of guy.
[15:16.200 --> 15:20.740]  I just, I want to see what happens when we go too far in a direction.
[15:20.900 --> 15:22.140]  Like, I want that.
[15:22.500 --> 15:23.620]  You should ask Emily about that.
[15:23.680 --> 15:25.320]  She did, she did the ayahuasca thing.
[15:25.500 --> 15:25.940]  See?
[15:26.420 --> 15:27.480]  But look, she's pretty normal.
[15:27.660 --> 15:28.380]  So, like, really.
[15:28.500 --> 15:29.340]  She married me.
[15:29.420 --> 15:30.300]  How normal could she be?
[15:31.720 --> 15:34.400]  I feel like I'm open to relaxing bullshit.
[15:35.060 --> 15:37.160]  Like, I would definitely get like a crystal.
[15:37.540 --> 15:43.220]  I get covered in crystals on my forehead and stuff, knowing full well that they're just putting rocks on me.
[15:43.220 --> 15:48.240]  But I feel like the ritual and the talking and all that would actually be relaxing.
[15:48.780 --> 15:48.960]  Yeah.
[15:49.360 --> 15:50.720]  It's fun to buy into you.
[15:51.240 --> 15:52.460]  Have you ever done a sound bath?
[15:52.800 --> 15:53.120]  No.
[15:53.680 --> 15:55.420]  With like the singing bowls and everything?
[15:55.620 --> 15:56.100]  That's cool.
[15:56.500 --> 15:57.000]  I do that too.
[15:57.100 --> 15:58.180]  It's all just very relaxing.
[15:58.360 --> 15:59.220]  It's all very relaxing.
[15:59.600 --> 16:02.040]  We have an old friend, Gavin, who does them professionally.
[16:02.760 --> 16:04.720]  Yeah, I've seen some of the videos.
[16:05.240 --> 16:06.040]  Yeah, seems cool.
[16:06.960 --> 16:10.780]  Yeah, once again, I would do it just for the relaxing factor, knowing full well I'm just vibrating.
[16:13.020 --> 16:21.060]  I love watching the Hammer Guy videos because it's typically like athletes that have injuries and stuff that he's hitting in the back with the thing.
[16:21.240 --> 16:28.360]  And it seems all very professional, but to imagine that he has no idea what he's doing and that it's all bullshit makes those so fucking funny.
[16:28.680 --> 16:32.420]  The idea of those guys, this cartoon mallet, and it's just like, oh yeah, you're real tense here.
[16:32.440 --> 16:35.040]  And then hits him a few times and like moves to the next spot.
[16:35.480 --> 16:38.540]  If you watch it within that context, they are so fucking funny.
[16:38.900 --> 16:40.340]  I love those videos for that reason.
[16:40.980 --> 16:47.100]  There's a sound bath photo that Eric posted where Gracie says it looks like Gavin and Gavin says it's his brother.
[16:47.560 --> 16:51.300]  Is it just me or does the area below his chin look like a wiener kind of?
[16:51.820 --> 16:53.480]  It looks like his neck is a dick.
[16:53.840 --> 16:56.320]  I didn't see it, but I see it now.
[16:56.500 --> 16:58.540]  It's got like a dicky Adam's apple.
[16:59.000 --> 17:02.560]  Yeah, it's all I can see. I can see his little pee hole.
[17:03.820 --> 17:05.120]  Yeah, he's got a neck urethra.
[17:05.780 --> 17:10.520]  It's like a neck of a cloud where like I didn't see it, but now it's all I see.
[17:10.980 --> 17:14.740]  And I could probably be convinced it looks like something else if someone else has a take on it.
[17:15.260 --> 17:18.000]  It's pretty hard, pretty hard looking dick to me.
[17:18.120 --> 17:19.120]  But uh...
[17:21.180 --> 17:25.840]  You think it's only when he lays on his back that it's that noticeable or do you think it's just a bad angle?
[17:25.840 --> 17:29.660]  You think he just walks around being a little, like a Gary dick neck they call him.
[17:30.380 --> 17:32.620]  Maybe that is the effect of the sound bowl.
[17:32.620 --> 17:34.340]  Maybe that's not typical.
[17:34.520 --> 17:37.240]  It's vibrating his inner penis out.
[17:37.480 --> 17:39.220]  Like it brings out a dicky little neck.
[17:40.300 --> 17:41.960]  Everybody knows about the third dick.
[17:42.400 --> 17:45.140]  Is this why boys have Adam's apples? I never realized.
[17:45.680 --> 17:46.860]  Wait, the third dick?
[17:47.260 --> 17:48.380]  Like the third eye.
[17:49.160 --> 17:51.180]  It's a dick. It was a joke.
[17:51.620 --> 17:53.320]  Just to clarify, how many penises do you have on you?
[17:55.080 --> 17:56.040]  Third dick!
[17:57.580 --> 18:00.440]  If you could have two penises, would you want two penises?
[18:00.900 --> 18:01.260]  No.
[18:01.720 --> 18:03.060]  I don't think I would either.
[18:03.480 --> 18:04.760]  I was thinking about this the other day actually.
[18:06.460 --> 18:07.500]  Gracie says yes.
[18:07.780 --> 18:09.400]  With an exclamation point.
[18:09.500 --> 18:10.980]  If I was to control the size, I would.
[18:12.180 --> 18:13.640]  Well, yeah, that's a little different.
[18:13.840 --> 18:14.880]  Okay, would you go bigger?
[18:15.640 --> 18:18.900]  Well no, like if I had one big one and one small one and I could rotate them out.
[18:20.160 --> 18:21.240]  What if you...
[18:21.240 --> 18:23.500]  You know, it's really kind of a no-lose situation.
[18:23.500 --> 18:28.700]  You could go for a comically large wiener with the second one.
[18:28.780 --> 18:32.420]  Or you could just make the second one way small, which makes your first one look way bigger anyway.
[18:33.120 --> 18:35.140]  Where is the second dick in this scenario?
[18:35.640 --> 18:36.260]  On my back?
[18:37.640 --> 18:39.740]  See, that's a problem. I don't like that.
[18:40.100 --> 18:45.720]  If I need to pee, I don't want to be like a fucking crazy daisy just splashing everywhere.
[18:46.000 --> 18:47.500]  I need some accuracy.
[18:47.960 --> 18:53.120]  See, I'm imagining mine. You know those old cameras where you would rotate the lens and it would change the lens to a different one?
[18:54.100 --> 18:55.800]  I'm imagining that for penises.
[18:56.260 --> 18:57.420]  Oh, like an attachment.
[18:58.060 --> 18:59.720]  Like you're swapping thumbsticks.
[19:00.320 --> 19:03.480]  I would think it wouldn't be worth it because...
[19:04.480 --> 19:07.880]  Well, it wouldn't be worth it for a myriad of reasons, but...
[19:07.880 --> 19:09.460]  I think that, like...
[19:10.040 --> 19:14.420]  Well, I'm not going to get into the sex side of it, but just think about this. You'd have to pee twice.
[19:15.080 --> 19:17.840]  Think about how much you pee now, double that, if you have two dicks.
[19:18.640 --> 19:20.220]  In the world in which you have two...
[19:20.220 --> 19:22.820]  Wait, wait, wait. Hang on, hang on. Don't get away from this.
[19:23.180 --> 19:24.460]  Why would you have to pee twice?
[19:25.580 --> 19:26.520]  Both dicks work.
[19:27.120 --> 19:28.860]  Both dicks pee, both dicks...
[19:28.860 --> 19:30.040]  They can't share a bladder?
[19:30.500 --> 19:32.520]  I don't understand. So you have two bladders?
[19:33.700 --> 19:38.000]  It's the whole dick mechanism, so it probably goes into... you probably have a double bladder, yeah.
[19:39.080 --> 19:43.300]  How's that part of the dick mechanism? Everything's connected if you follow the line back.
[19:44.260 --> 19:45.260]  That means you have two mouths.
[19:45.260 --> 19:51.540]  Okay, fine. You have an extra large bladder to accommodate the need for two dicks, so you still pee out of both of them.
[19:51.600 --> 19:53.340]  I don't... hang on. I don't understand.
[19:53.380 --> 19:53.620]  I agree.
[19:54.320 --> 19:57.440]  To accommodate the need for two dicks...
[19:57.440 --> 20:00.100]  Yeah, the dicks gotta go somewhere, they gotta connect to stuff.
[20:00.320 --> 20:01.480]  So they're gonna have two prostates?
[20:02.720 --> 20:08.200]  I think Geoff is overthinking it. Just for... when it comes to the pee, it's like you put a splitter in, and both dicks...
[20:08.200 --> 20:09.880]  Yeah, there you go. Exactly, yeah.
[20:10.060 --> 20:10.420]  There you go.
[20:11.180 --> 20:15.040]  Gracie said one functional, one pleasurable. And I don't like that.
[20:15.040 --> 20:15.340]  Gross.
[20:15.880 --> 20:20.100]  You can't pick, like you can't choose which one to pee out of. When you pee, they both pee.
[20:20.140 --> 20:20.400]  Why?
[20:20.460 --> 20:21.300]  Oh, that's risky.
[20:21.500 --> 20:22.040]  It's just the way it works.
[20:22.460 --> 20:25.200]  So maybe the dick on my back can do like an upper decker.
[20:26.040 --> 20:26.440]  No.
[20:26.940 --> 20:28.080]  Yeah, I guess so.
[20:28.280 --> 20:30.020]  But I could empty them both at the same time.
[20:30.300 --> 20:36.300]  If the dick's stacked, I want a double barrel dick for pissing. That sounds great. I'm on board with that.
[20:37.440 --> 20:39.480]  Like a real blunderbuss situation.
[20:39.500 --> 20:40.760]  Yeah, exactly.
[20:42.100 --> 20:49.200]  I also really like the idea Gavin has presented of like you have multiple dicks, but they pop on and pop off like it's a fucking golf bag.
[20:49.680 --> 20:52.340]  Like I try to decide what dick I need for the scenario.
[20:52.620 --> 20:55.180]  Yeah, like you eye up the situation and decide.
[20:55.540 --> 21:00.220]  Because I feel like 90-95% of the time I'd be in small dick mode.
[21:01.740 --> 21:06.480]  Imagine like in a group shower being like, this fucking guy's showering with a wedge. This guy's ridiculous.
[21:12.230 --> 21:15.490]  Oh, man. Where did everyone go?
[21:15.830 --> 21:19.970]  I was going to say, I feel like we all just everyone stopped and thought about it for a minute.
[21:20.290 --> 21:24.090]  Well, I'm just thinking like, I'm not going to pick a dick. I don't think I think a dick is too obvious.
[21:24.290 --> 21:27.330]  So I would probably pick something else. But I was just trying to think of what I would pick.
[21:27.930 --> 21:32.430]  Like if you had to have an extra, like you had to have one extra body part that worked.
[21:33.370 --> 21:36.410]  And it was always attached to you. Like it's not what we're talking about.
[21:36.410 --> 21:40.450]  It's like having a third nipple or like you have three ears.
[21:40.790 --> 21:44.730]  Tongue is good, but it wouldn't be in my mouth.
[21:45.410 --> 21:46.270]  Where would it be?
[21:46.690 --> 21:50.490]  It would probably be a cleaning tongue. So I'd have no taste buds on it.
[21:50.710 --> 21:56.870]  And it would just be next to my arsehole and provide the same function that animals like a cat lick.
[21:56.930 --> 21:59.610]  So you're going to lick your arsehole clean?
[21:59.830 --> 22:03.790]  Yeah, no, not the tasting. There's no taste, but it's just literally a cleaning tongue.
[22:04.370 --> 22:07.730]  So where does the stuff it licks go?
[22:07.970 --> 22:09.390]  It just like spits it off.
[22:09.710 --> 22:14.830]  It sounds to me like you're just transferring all the waste from your butthole to your tongue and then you gotta wipe your tongue clean.
[22:17.870 --> 22:23.210]  I think if you're adding a second, you can't change the function of it. I think it has to function the same way.
[22:23.370 --> 22:24.930]  You just want to lick your own arsehole.
[22:26.330 --> 22:27.910]  I mean, if you had a tongue.
[22:28.090 --> 22:35.310]  Okay, imagine you've just finished up with the bog. You've got it all out.
[22:35.830 --> 22:39.670]  And then someone just licked your arsehole clean. You didn't taste it.
[22:40.250 --> 22:41.590]  Someone just licked it clean.
[22:41.870 --> 22:42.690]  That's awful. No.
[22:42.950 --> 22:44.230]  But it's no one. It's no one.
[22:44.330 --> 22:45.030]  No, this is terrible.
[22:45.470 --> 22:45.910]  What do you mean?
[22:46.070 --> 22:47.770]  No, there's no selling on this.
[22:47.910 --> 22:48.650]  That would feel great.
[22:49.350 --> 22:51.190]  No, I disagree.
[22:52.010 --> 22:53.150]  Why wouldn't that feel good?
[22:53.690 --> 22:56.350]  Somebody pull the cord. Eject. We gotta get out of this.
[22:56.690 --> 22:56.910]  Alright.
[22:57.290 --> 22:58.530]  I would have two hearts.
[22:58.770 --> 22:59.530]  Who's got other notes?
[23:00.090 --> 23:04.450]  No, I mean, Gracie's right. Does this have to do with why you thought the waxing would feel good?
[23:04.590 --> 23:06.330]  Yeah, it does feel very similar.
[23:06.970 --> 23:07.110]  Yeah.
[23:07.990 --> 23:08.330]  Definitely.
[23:09.470 --> 23:10.270]  You definitely...
[23:11.270 --> 23:12.090]  Oh, Lord.
[23:12.730 --> 23:14.210]  I don't think I would turn that down.
[23:15.750 --> 23:18.410]  Clearly you won't. You're the one pitching it. You're the inventor.
[23:18.930 --> 23:21.510]  Why are you saying I wouldn't turn it down? You made it.
[23:21.510 --> 23:22.610]  What do you not like about it?
[23:23.310 --> 23:23.830]  Everything.
[23:24.650 --> 23:27.130]  About getting your poopy butthole licked?
[23:28.450 --> 23:32.450]  It's cleaning. It's like pitching the plane and going, I mean, I wouldn't turn this down.
[23:32.590 --> 23:36.510]  Yeah, I'd jump off that hill. What are you talking about? You just did.
[23:37.170 --> 23:39.190]  We're not asking your opinion on this.
[23:40.330 --> 23:44.690]  It's what an animal already does with its actual taste tongue, but better than that.
[23:44.690 --> 23:48.990]  I don't care what an animal does. Why does that make me feel better about it?
[23:49.110 --> 23:49.930]  I don't know.
[23:49.930 --> 23:52.370]  Why are you trying to convince us that we want this?
[23:52.370 --> 23:55.490]  A bear fucking devours and eats other animals. I'm not going to start eating people.
[23:55.830 --> 23:58.430]  Well, you do eat other animals.
[23:58.870 --> 24:00.690]  Yeah, but I don't eat...
[24:00.690 --> 24:02.410]  Yeah, but bears don't eat bears.
[24:03.030 --> 24:05.530]  Okay, well name another animal that eats young.
[24:06.230 --> 24:07.510]  Isn't that... what the fuck...
[24:07.510 --> 24:11.470]  Oh, oh, oh, oh. Fucking... what are those guys that... beavers.
[24:11.970 --> 24:12.930]  Do they eat their young?
[24:13.250 --> 24:17.170]  They fucking eat and... it's brutal. Just read about it. I don't want to talk about it. It's brutal.
[24:17.230 --> 24:18.010]  It's brutal what they do.
[24:18.030 --> 24:19.310]  Oh, and autism stuff?
[24:19.310 --> 24:21.790]  Otters and beavers and shit. Yeah, they're cruel.
[24:23.310 --> 24:24.350]  I feel like orcas maybe?
[24:25.090 --> 24:25.650]  Yeah, they're adorable.
[24:26.130 --> 24:28.490]  They're motherfuckers. They're awful.
[24:29.090 --> 24:30.090]  Geoff and I hung out.
[24:30.990 --> 24:32.950]  It had nothing to do with tongues.
[24:33.710 --> 24:34.070]  That's true.
[24:34.750 --> 24:38.110]  Were you using Geoff's non-tasting tongue? Or what was happening?
[24:38.210 --> 24:41.070]  No, it wasn't in any way poopy.
[24:41.710 --> 24:43.490]  I feel like my hypothetical got...
[24:43.490 --> 24:44.050]  Oh my god.
[24:44.290 --> 24:45.370]  It was just a hypothetical.
[24:46.890 --> 24:47.770]  But you...
[24:47.770 --> 24:51.110]  I don't want someone to lick my poopy butt. I'm just saying if I had...
[24:51.110 --> 24:55.050]  You just said you did. You were like, it'd feel great. Come on. It'd feel awesome.
[24:55.210 --> 24:57.570]  But there's not someone is the point. It's no one.
[25:00.910 --> 25:01.350]  Okay.
[25:01.570 --> 25:03.750]  I mean, if we're...
[25:05.410 --> 25:11.370]  Imagine Meg walked in, Gavin, and you're spread-cheeked and you have a tongue in your ass that's licking yourself.
[25:11.370 --> 25:15.910]  You think they're gonna be pumped about it? You think they're gonna be like, no, that's fine.
[25:16.170 --> 25:21.290]  I'll be honest. I grossed myself out five seconds into this idea, and I want nothing to do with it.
[25:21.430 --> 25:24.370]  But we've been arguing so much that I just have to get behind it now.
[25:24.650 --> 25:27.730]  No, you don't! You could just say that was a bad idea.
[25:28.210 --> 25:29.150]  You know what? That was a bad idea.
[25:29.690 --> 25:30.790]  So Geoff and I were hanging out.
[25:31.370 --> 25:32.630]  Geoff and you were hanging out.
[25:34.590 --> 25:37.670]  We did. Gavin, do you want to tell them why we were hanging out?
[25:38.110 --> 25:38.950]  This is your thing.
[25:38.950 --> 25:44.090]  Geoff very kindly agreed to help me film something, because I was just demoing this camera.
[25:44.270 --> 25:48.250]  It's the one I brought to the waxing. It's quite a small slow-mo camera.
[25:48.730 --> 25:54.990]  And I thought, oh, what would be a cool thing if I put it on the end of a stick, and I tracked Geoff redoing his bike jump.
[25:55.110 --> 25:57.770]  So I just asked him, can you still do your bike jump?
[25:58.890 --> 25:59.970]  And we went out there.
[26:00.630 --> 26:04.130]  You don't have the same bike, so we went and got a BMX out of storage.
[26:04.470 --> 26:05.510]  It was a whole thing, actually, wasn't it?
[26:06.050 --> 26:08.610]  Yeah, but Gavin picked the wrong day to ask for help.
[26:08.810 --> 26:14.450]  Because on that same day, my wife told me to move a dining room table into my storage facility.
[26:15.030 --> 26:17.510]  And I was like, who the fuck am I going to ask to help? I don't know dudes.
[26:18.170 --> 26:19.810]  I was like, all right, I'll get it taken care of.
[26:19.950 --> 26:22.950]  And then Gavin asked me to help him with his bike, or with the bike trick.
[26:22.990 --> 26:28.010]  And I went, yeah, but we have to get my bike out of storage. I have a BMX we have to get out of storage.
[26:28.050 --> 26:28.850]  And he was like, yeah, okay.
[26:28.850 --> 26:37.950]  So when he got to my house, I was like, all we have to do first is just throw this giant heavy glass table into the car and then unload it.
[26:38.170 --> 26:40.170]  So I tricked him into helping me move a table.
[26:40.510 --> 26:41.650]  I mean, I would have just helped you.
[26:42.090 --> 26:43.590]  I know, but it was more fun to trick you.
[26:45.750 --> 26:48.710]  I had this old BMX that I used to ride forever ago.
[26:49.130 --> 26:51.130]  I don't think I had ridden it in over a decade.
[26:51.550 --> 26:54.370]  I was trying to figure it out. Like Millie was like in fourth grade when I would ride it.
[26:54.370 --> 27:01.490]  It was so old that not only were there no air in the tires, but the little filler thing wasn't even poking through the hole.
[27:01.610 --> 27:03.910]  Like the whole inner tube was hanging off.
[27:04.510 --> 27:08.130]  So we brought it home and we put it back together and we aired up the tires.
[27:08.750 --> 27:15.550]  And we threw it in the back of Emily's car and drove it down to the old bike trick spot.
[27:19.190 --> 27:28.770]  Dude, riding that bike at like 35 was one thing. Riding a tiny BMX at 48, I felt like I was riding a clown bicycle.
[27:29.430 --> 27:33.490]  You know, like the tiny one that's like three inches off the ground.
[27:34.330 --> 27:37.870]  It was so fucking hard to even pedal that thing.
[27:38.030 --> 27:41.690]  I felt like such a lumbering oaf on it, but it was so much fun.
[27:41.690 --> 27:45.750]  I plopped my backpack down. I started putting together the camera, like putting it on the end of the stick.
[27:46.210 --> 27:50.010]  And then I was just going to ride my one wheel behind him with like a low angle.
[27:50.350 --> 27:56.130]  And as I was just screwing the camera to the stick, Geoff's like, I'm just gonna, I'll just run the path. I'll test it out.
[27:56.350 --> 27:59.550]  And he just goes, he comes out of the tunnel, goes up the thing, goes past me.
[27:59.630 --> 28:03.990]  And I'm still just looking at the bottom of this camera. And then I just hear an explosion.
[28:05.370 --> 28:11.470]  I look over. It's just a cloud of dust in the air.
[28:13.010 --> 28:15.890]  And Geoff's on the floor, nowhere near the bottom.
[28:20.000 --> 28:27.280]  Wasn't even filming yet. And then, uh, just walks over dripping blood all over the ground.
[28:29.260 --> 28:31.700]  That's a lot of blood for how little I got cut.
[28:32.080 --> 28:34.180]  You cut the shit out of both hands. Was it both?
[28:34.820 --> 28:36.100]  Yeah, it was both hands.
[28:36.600 --> 28:41.700]  So immediately I was like, oh, we should, we should go back then, right? Like, you surely can't do it now.
[28:42.720 --> 28:44.540]  Uh, but you, you plowed through.
[28:44.920 --> 28:48.300]  Yeah. I was like, I'm already bleeding. I don't know. Why quit now?
[28:48.880 --> 28:50.060]  I don't want to bleed for nothing.
[28:50.420 --> 28:54.560]  I'm pretty sure. I haven't looked at it closely. I'm pretty sure it's some of the footage.
[28:54.920 --> 28:58.620]  When you land, a bunch of blood flies off in slow motion.
[29:01.600 --> 29:03.640]  It's blood or sweat. I can't tell what it is.
[29:03.640 --> 29:06.140]  But there's liquid coming out of you on impact.
[29:06.640 --> 29:11.620]  It was like 68 degrees. And the second I started riding that bike, it felt like it was 115.
[29:12.120 --> 29:14.740]  It could have been sweat, dude. It got so hot so fast.
[29:15.420 --> 29:18.240]  Yeah, I, so I thought I would just like trace the path like we used to do.
[29:18.300 --> 29:23.420]  But it's a whole different animal on a BMX than it was on that big ass lumbering, self-propelled bicycle.
[29:24.140 --> 29:27.900]  And so I went a little too fast and a little too slow at the same time up the hill on the test.
[29:28.000 --> 29:33.360]  And so I just completely wiped out and then slid my hands down the concrete, which is where they got all cut up.
[29:33.360 --> 29:36.540]  Fucking, I posted a picture of that and I was just like filming with Gavin Instagram.
[29:36.780 --> 29:39.400]  It's the first picture I've ever had taken down from Instagram.
[29:39.600 --> 29:44.720]  I logged back in and they were like, remove this image immediately or we'll restrict your account.
[29:46.620 --> 29:49.980]  God damn. All right. But we did it.
[29:50.020 --> 29:53.200]  And then, I don't know, we did the trick like four or five times.
[29:53.400 --> 29:57.420]  By the time we were done, I'm not lying. I thought I was going to die.
[29:57.620 --> 30:00.820]  I was so out of breath and so worn out.
[30:00.820 --> 30:06.180]  I went home and laid down for like a half an hour after we did that trick.
[30:06.660 --> 30:11.780]  I can't believe you were still able to do it. I appreciate your dedication to that dumb video.
[30:12.460 --> 30:15.920]  Dude, I had so much fun doing it and it was fun to be able to do it again.
[30:16.180 --> 30:18.320]  It's way easier on an e-bike than that little BMX.
[30:18.480 --> 30:29.300]  But I was also, I was sitting there, right? And I'm like, essentially 49 years old, hanging out in a drainage ditch on a BMX, waiting for somebody to yell go so I can jump a little ramp.
[30:29.300 --> 30:32.980]  And I was thinking, not a lot of 49 year olds doing this right now, probably.
[30:33.340 --> 30:34.640]  I felt pretty good about myself.
[30:35.100 --> 30:41.780]  That's awesome. I'm excited to see the footage of this. Is it an upcoming Slumber Guys video or is it like a social thing? Where can I watch this?
[30:42.040 --> 30:47.920]  It'll be on my second channel at some point. And then we can maybe put just the raw clip on the f*** face shorts or something.
[30:48.240 --> 30:48.460]  Cool.
[30:53.640 --> 30:55.560]  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[30:55.900 --> 31:01.740]  When it comes to relationships, whether they're with family or personal, they take a lot of work.
[31:01.740 --> 31:10.320]  And you go through so many cycles of them, at least in my experience, of things can be great, things can be terrible.
[31:10.740 --> 31:15.400]  Even in events where things are terrible, it can be so many factors of why are they like that?
[31:15.460 --> 31:17.860]  Are there things that you're doing? Do you have unhealthy habits?
[31:18.600 --> 31:24.340]  Or just things that you're doing that are toxic or non-positive that you don't have an awareness of?
[31:24.360 --> 31:30.260]  Or maybe you don't understand how your actions are impacting somebody in a way that you possibly don't even intend.
[31:30.800 --> 31:34.900]  People are complicated. Feelings and relationships are extremely complicated.
[31:35.660 --> 31:44.440]  I know in my life, therapy has been something that has really helped me guide not just myself, but those dynamics of those relationships,
[31:44.580 --> 31:52.640]  where having the ability to talk about things and get a better understanding of maybe some of the things that have happened to me,
[31:52.760 --> 31:59.060]  and how to process them and work through them in a more healthy way, as well as just being mindful of my own actions
[31:59.060 --> 32:05.840]  and making sure that I'm not impacting people that I care about in a negative way.
[32:06.320 --> 32:08.400]  Because that's... I would never want to do that.
[32:08.620 --> 32:14.900]  But whatever the process is, just therapy in general is so helpful and it's something that I would strongly recommend anyone go through.
[32:15.060 --> 32:22.540]  I think it's just such a healthy process that allows you to take inventory of yourself and to talk to a professional
[32:23.020 --> 32:29.640]  that will illuminate areas of your life that you may not even realize you need to work on or that they're the source of.

[32:56.720 --> 33:01.960]  Hello! I am here to talk about the most delicious apple on the planet, which is the Cosmic Crisp.
[33:02.480 --> 33:11.040]  In my opinion, and it should be yours as well, it's just phenomenal. It's so juicy. It's crunchy. It's everything you want in an apple.
[33:11.160 --> 33:14.400]  And I take my apples seriously. I have a long history of apples.
[33:14.400 --> 33:21.500]  When I was growing up, my grandparents' backyard had an apple tree, and that started my love of them. Picking them was always so much fun.
[33:22.000 --> 33:30.540]  The apple is near and dear to my heart, so when I first tried the Cosmic Crisp, my expectations were high. I had a high bar, and it flew over it.
[33:30.640 --> 33:36.400]  It's so good. And also just interacting with the people at Cosmic Crisp. They're all so lovely.
[33:36.400 --> 33:45.760]  It's been such an exciting and unbelievably fun process getting to interact with them and us establishing sort of a bond between our two brands.
[33:46.040 --> 33:51.960]  It's been crazy in the best way. I never thought we'd become great friends with an apple company, but we are.
[33:52.080 --> 33:55.320]  And we can't thank them enough for sponsoring our show.
[33:56.080 --> 33:59.400]  It's the best apple. It's the regulation apple.
[33:59.700 --> 34:05.740]  They also have other products as well. They make a cider. There's a Cosmic Crisp cider, which I haven't had the pleasure of trying.
[34:06.300 --> 34:10.320]  I don't think it's available in my area, but that might not be true, so please look into that.
[34:10.580 --> 34:15.900]  They also just have fantastic merch on their store. They got hats, they got shirts, they got all sorts of things.
[34:16.080 --> 34:20.740]  They're just awesome. We love Cosmic Crisp. They've been so wonderful to us.
[34:21.660 --> 34:24.460]  I just can't thank them enough for sponsoring us.
[34:25.300 --> 34:29.920]  It's the perfect apple. It doesn't brown. It's slow to brown, which is insane.
[34:29.920 --> 34:37.680]  There are times where I've literally taken a bite, walked away for a few hours, come back, and it's looked the exact same, which I've never experienced with any other apple.
[34:37.940 --> 34:39.480]  I'm going on and on because I love them.
[34:40.020 --> 34:46.520]  If you want recipe ideas and to learn more about the apple itself or just the brand in general, go to CosmicCrisp.com.
[34:47.940 --> 34:50.140]  CosmicCrisp.com. Check them out. We love them. They're the best.
[34:52.940 --> 35:00.580]  Maybe every three or four or five years, I'll just redo the jump and then we'll see at what point we can no longer handle it.
[35:01.240 --> 35:07.380]  Just the whole day was still a calamity, though. Nothing ever goes normal when we're hanging out.
[35:07.800 --> 35:12.780]  We were kind of in a rush to pack everything back up. Geoff's bleeding all over the place. We want to get back. It's hot.
[35:13.220 --> 35:18.120]  So I half packed up. I just started shoving shit in my backpack. It was all sticking out.
[35:18.120 --> 35:24.840]  Then I guess I started just dropping stuff all over Geoff's car. You found a piece of my iPad in there.
[35:25.880 --> 35:31.840]  I've also got Dan's luggage tags for some reason.
[35:32.220 --> 35:34.780]  Oh, OK. Why do I have those?
[35:35.160 --> 35:35.600]  I don't know.
[35:36.240 --> 35:38.060]  Do you have the picture that I sent you? I don't have my phone.
[35:38.660 --> 35:39.600]  Yeah, I do.
[35:40.380 --> 35:45.180]  I feel like it's dangerous for you two to get together regularly. There needs to be at least a week between.
[35:45.600 --> 35:47.340]  It's why the weather used to try and prevent it.
[35:48.040 --> 35:50.340]  It doesn't rain anymore, luckily, but...
[35:51.100 --> 35:54.200]  All right, here we go. This is the picture Gavin sent me.
[35:54.280 --> 36:00.780]  So I guess when I was pulling all my stuff out of Geoff's car, a toothpaste fell out onto my driveway and then Geoff ran over it.
[36:01.000 --> 36:05.870]  Oh, man!
[36:10.810 --> 36:15.010]  Is this a complete accident by you, Geoff? You had no idea?
[36:15.470 --> 36:16.870]  I had no fucking clue until he showed me.
[36:16.870 --> 36:17.730]  How would I know?
[36:18.270 --> 36:22.770]  I don't know. I'm just saying that feels like a thing that would give you so much joy in the moment.
[36:23.050 --> 36:26.670]  Oh, it absolutely did when I found out about it slightly later.
[36:27.650 --> 36:29.230]  Now I need a new travel toothpaste.
[36:29.850 --> 36:30.930]  Aw, that sucks, bud.
[36:32.790 --> 36:34.270]  But it was fun. Eventful and fun.
[36:35.010 --> 36:38.410]  It was fun. I had so much fun hanging out. It was so fun to revisit.
[36:38.630 --> 36:42.790]  Here's the... it took me a while to find it. Here's the photo of the blood.
[36:44.130 --> 36:44.930]  Oh, God!
[36:44.930 --> 36:50.610]  Okay. Oh, it's not that bad. That's way less than I was imagining for it being taken down by Instagram.
[36:50.990 --> 36:51.810]  It was dripping, though.
[36:52.170 --> 36:55.370]  I was surprised that they took it down. It was just basically both hands in the same places.
[36:56.870 --> 37:03.210]  It was so much fun to just revisit an old idea again, and it was kind of like we were there... I don't know.
[37:03.330 --> 37:11.190]  I was doing it and remembering doing it the first time, and it was kind of cool to be living in both of those times in one moment.
[37:11.570 --> 37:12.670]  Briefly. It was cool. It was a lot of fun.
[37:12.670 --> 37:18.810]  And it's such a unique way of doing that. Like, not many people revisit a bank jump that they've done in the past.
[37:18.970 --> 37:21.050]  Like, it's such a strangely specific thing.
[37:23.330 --> 37:25.050]  Especially when that's not what you do.
[37:25.290 --> 37:29.170]  But it's like a thing you have done once and are now revisiting.
[37:29.870 --> 37:32.950]  It had been so long since I'd been down there, I couldn't remember where it was.
[37:33.030 --> 37:38.510]  Like, I don't take that bike path anymore. I go a completely different way, and I have for like maybe the last two years.
[37:39.170 --> 37:40.890]  What made you stop taking that path?
[37:40.890 --> 37:46.890]  It's just more efficient to get to that... I like that place, like where we are, on the trail.
[37:47.090 --> 37:52.490]  But I have to go through a lot of streets to get to that trail, and I just prefer not to ride on the road at all, if possible.
[37:52.650 --> 37:53.050]  That makes sense.
[37:53.090 --> 38:03.350]  Like, I haven't worked out where I have... I'm on like... I have to take like two blocks on a road, and then I can ride 30 miles of trails without having to worry about cars at all.
[38:03.450 --> 38:06.270]  And so, I just go that way now because it's safer.
[38:07.630 --> 38:08.230]  That's awesome.
[38:08.730 --> 38:11.830]  I'm glad you have an efficient path. You don't need to worry about jumps.
[38:12.230 --> 38:15.330]  The gentle ghost, I'm assuming, hasn't attacked you on your new path?
[38:15.390 --> 38:20.450]  No, I don't go the gentle ghost way anymore. Like, I've eliminated all potential hazards.
[38:20.990 --> 38:21.430]  Great.
[38:23.950 --> 38:27.690]  Jumps, and embankments that could freeze, and gentle ghosts, and the whole deal.
[38:27.850 --> 38:33.730]  The real goal, and up until yesterday I was doing pretty good with it, the real goal is just not to bleed.
[38:34.290 --> 38:36.010]  Yeah, that's the dream.
[38:36.010 --> 38:44.230]  Failed pretty hard. Failed within like 30 seconds yesterday, but for the most part I do pretty well with it. I haven't wrecked my bike in a very long time.
[38:44.590 --> 38:45.190]  I got a life hack.
[38:45.570 --> 38:48.830]  Oh! That reminds me, I have a life hack too. Go ahead.
[38:49.430 --> 38:53.870]  Mine is, when you move into a new place, time your tub.
[38:54.870 --> 38:55.950]  Time your tub?
[38:56.290 --> 39:02.910]  I'm constantly running a bath, walking away from it, not knowing how long I have. Sometimes I forget I've started it.
[39:02.910 --> 39:07.290]  I timed it! I got an 8 minute tub, so now I set a little 8 minute timer every time I run one.
[39:07.810 --> 39:11.550]  See, I can't relate to this at all, because I get in the bath first as established.
[39:11.550 --> 39:12.970]  Oh yeah, you are the timer.
[39:13.690 --> 39:18.450]  I am the timer, I'm just aware, I can keep control, I like being on top of things.
[39:18.870 --> 39:21.510]  I'd love to know the time of your tub though.
[39:22.450 --> 39:26.550]  I'll time it next time, I'll let you know when we hit, with me in it, it'll be quick capacity.
[39:26.850 --> 39:28.110]  Anyone else know their tub times?
[39:28.110 --> 39:32.550]  I don't, but I'm gonna go fill up my tub after this and record my tub time.
[39:35.570 --> 39:40.250]  That's great. So, your 8 minutes, is it exactly 8 or like 8 something?
[39:41.270 --> 39:45.790]  It's slightly more than 8 minutes, but the Allama 8 minutes gives me enough time to get to the tub and turn it off.
[39:46.890 --> 39:50.470]  Gracie says I spend close to an hour in the tub, rookie numbers. You gotta bump those up.
[39:50.650 --> 39:52.130]  But roughly 4 to fill.
[39:52.390 --> 39:53.370]  4 minute tub?
[39:54.590 --> 39:56.450]  That's a fast tub.
[39:56.450 --> 39:59.250]  That's a goddamn fast tub, Jesus Christ.
[40:00.650 --> 40:02.030]  Barely worth walking away from.
[40:03.570 --> 40:05.710]  Well, I don't walk away from it.
[40:05.990 --> 40:09.110]  Did the Army Corps of Engineers plumb your bathroom? Good lord.
[40:10.070 --> 40:11.350]  I got a 4 minute tub.
[40:12.010 --> 40:14.170]  As opposed to a 60 second car or whatever.
[40:14.910 --> 40:20.530]  There is no way I have an 8 minute tub even, I bet my tub takes closer to 10 minutes.
[40:22.270 --> 40:24.810]  I could be wrong, but I feel like it fills really quickly.
[40:24.810 --> 40:27.110]  Wait, you're just throwing out 4 as a guess?
[40:27.550 --> 40:30.310]  Why would I have taken the time to test it?
[40:30.910 --> 40:33.650]  I just don't know why you're chiming in with a number if you haven't tested it.
[40:34.450 --> 40:35.670]  I'm so happy.
[40:37.770 --> 40:39.950]  I've decided I have a 3 minute tub.
[40:42.090 --> 40:44.090]  Mine's like 230, dude, you're fucked.
[40:44.410 --> 40:45.430]  God damn it.
[40:47.870 --> 40:52.750]  If yours isn't close to 4 minutes, that's an insane thing to say.
[40:52.750 --> 40:55.230]  Okay, well, I'll test it later.
[40:56.890 --> 41:00.390]  So, the timer stops once it hits the drain thing, right?
[41:00.490 --> 41:01.710]  Yeah, once it's no longer filling.
[41:02.310 --> 41:05.690]  You know what would be a dangerous way to test this?
[41:05.950 --> 41:07.350]  How far into this episode are we?
[41:08.190 --> 41:09.710]  Mid episode tub test?
[41:10.670 --> 41:11.390]  Here's what we do.
[41:11.570 --> 41:17.430]  We set an 8 minute timer and then we all go turn our tubs on and we can't check for 8 minutes.
[41:17.930 --> 41:18.730]  There's no way.
[41:18.750 --> 41:19.770]  What if they overflow?
[41:20.190 --> 41:21.650]  I mean, I'm not doing that.
[41:22.030 --> 41:23.650]  That'd be a goddamn nightmare, wouldn't it?
[41:23.790 --> 41:24.750]  Yeah, I'm not doing that.
[41:25.310 --> 41:28.130]  Well, it sounds like mine might overflow.
[41:28.170 --> 41:28.630]  It won't overflow.
[41:29.230 --> 41:29.630]  Twice.
[41:31.410 --> 41:32.330]  Should I start?
[41:33.510 --> 41:36.270]  Wait, hang on, we're not really doing this, are we?
[41:36.530 --> 41:38.230]  Yeah, let's all fill our tubs, why wouldn't we?
[41:38.550 --> 41:40.690]  I don't want my tub to overflow.
[41:41.670 --> 41:43.450]  There's a drain in the top of it.
[41:43.630 --> 41:45.150]  I don't trust that.
[41:45.150 --> 41:46.150]  There's an overflow valve.
[41:46.750 --> 41:48.190]  I don't trust it at all.
[41:48.630 --> 41:49.770]  You guys are very trusting.
[41:50.250 --> 41:51.670]  Okay, let's go. Ready?
[41:51.870 --> 41:52.730]  Are you guys ready?
[41:53.910 --> 41:55.650]  Gavin, start the 8 minutes and then we'll run.
[41:56.370 --> 41:59.550]  Oh wait, we're running to our tubs to start it once the timer starts?
[42:00.890 --> 42:03.370]  I mean, I can't take my headphones with me, so we'll just...
[42:03.370 --> 42:04.590]  How far from your tub are you?
[42:04.850 --> 42:05.310]  Seconds, right?
[42:06.150 --> 42:06.510]  Yeah.
[42:07.470 --> 42:10.490]  Alright, Gavin, you want to count us down?
[42:11.950 --> 42:12.310]  Okay.
[42:12.990 --> 42:14.790]  Oh wait, are y'all's drains already closed?
[42:15.470 --> 42:17.470]  We'll do it as you do it.
[42:18.270 --> 42:21.730]  Alright, 3, 2, 1...
[42:21.730 --> 42:22.090]  Commence!
[42:27.530 --> 42:30.610]  I don't think I've ever been on my own in the podcast before.
[42:31.410 --> 42:31.850]  Hey everyone!
[42:32.630 --> 42:33.170]  Alright, mine's going.
[42:34.630 --> 42:35.830]  You were fast.
[42:37.130 --> 42:38.650]  My apartment's only so big.
[42:40.670 --> 42:42.790]  I'm right next to my tub, so...
[42:42.790 --> 42:44.030]  Oh, that's a good point.
[42:44.530 --> 42:46.010]  Where are you recording from?
[42:46.570 --> 42:47.010]  My bedroom.
[42:47.850 --> 42:50.650]  So did you go on full power with the taps?
[42:51.370 --> 42:52.090]  Uh, yeah, of course.
[42:53.130 --> 42:55.090]  I just assumed that that would be...
[42:55.090 --> 42:57.690]  Yeah, I didn't have time to waste, I just...
[42:57.690 --> 42:57.890]  Yeah.
[42:58.990 --> 43:01.570]  I don't know about this 8 minute thing.
[43:02.430 --> 43:03.930]  You think you're going to be done with it in 8?
[43:04.530 --> 43:06.490]  Looks like it's filling pretty fast, I don't know.
[43:08.010 --> 43:11.750]  I wasn't anticipating being on the wrong side of the 8 minutes.
[43:12.070 --> 43:16.490]  Is it better to run them all for 8 minutes, or just find out the actual times of each tub?
[43:17.490 --> 43:18.470]  Well, we've already started it now.
[43:18.470 --> 43:20.270]  I think just finding out the actual times, but...
[43:20.270 --> 43:21.850]  Well, now you're just going to have people leaving the podcast.
[43:22.410 --> 43:24.130]  Alright, we'll do 8 minutes.
[43:25.390 --> 43:26.290]  We'll just see how everyone's doing.
[43:26.290 --> 43:28.330]  Hey, I just got back. Did we not set a timer?
[43:28.970 --> 43:29.470]  Yeah, I set it.
[43:30.650 --> 43:31.710]  How far into it are we?
[43:32.570 --> 43:33.310]  It's been about a minute.
[43:34.170 --> 43:34.910]  Nick sounds desperate.
[43:38.750 --> 43:42.270]  Is your kid, like, getting scared, Nick, that it's like bath time or something?
[43:43.490 --> 43:44.890]  I'm very confused right now.
[43:45.190 --> 43:49.630]  No, but my dog started bothering him, so I had to physically pick him up and pull him into this room.
[43:50.150 --> 43:51.110]  The dog or the kid?
[43:51.630 --> 43:52.890]  Who did you have to pick up?
[43:53.070 --> 43:56.290]  We don't want anybody in your family to drown today in this bit.
[43:56.730 --> 44:01.910]  If anyone listening at home wants to also do the 8 minute tub challenge, feel free to turn it on.
[44:02.870 --> 44:04.870]  Oh my god. Has it been 8 minutes yet?
[44:05.450 --> 44:06.250]  I think it's been about 1.
[44:07.330 --> 44:08.630]  What do you mean you think?
[44:08.710 --> 44:10.090]  Your timer's flooded yet?
[44:10.550 --> 44:12.010]  Well, I wrote down the time.
[44:12.930 --> 44:15.330]  Hang on! Wait, you didn't set a timer?
[44:16.050 --> 44:16.250]  Yeah.
[44:16.870 --> 44:17.590]  Wait, why?
[44:18.290 --> 44:20.410]  Yeah, you did, or yeah, you didn't.
[44:20.450 --> 44:21.090]  It's been 2 minutes.
[44:21.970 --> 44:24.470]  He wrote down the time. He didn't set up a proper timer.
[44:24.550 --> 44:27.890]  He doesn't have his phone. He did say earlier that he did have his phone on.
[44:28.050 --> 44:29.010]  I'm using my watch.
[44:30.830 --> 44:31.950]  He's keeping track.
[44:32.550 --> 44:36.470]  I have a little thing to fill for 6 minutes if we want, and then we can go back to it.
[44:37.350 --> 44:44.690]  Gavin and I, I don't know what Let's Play it was, but we had an extended debate about whether Mr. Magoo was blind or not.
[44:44.830 --> 44:49.430]  Because we both had an awareness of who Mr. Magoo is, but we knew nothing about him.
[44:49.770 --> 44:52.030]  Gavin was convinced Mr. Magoo was blind.
[44:52.570 --> 44:57.070]  I was convinced that he was just a fumbling idiot, and that he was just clumsy.
[44:57.070 --> 44:59.650]  And we went back and forth, and we couldn't verify it.
[44:59.810 --> 45:04.970]  So we looked. I did some brief Googling just to see if I could find anything.
[45:05.130 --> 45:06.870]  Even the poster for the movie doesn't help.
[45:07.250 --> 45:09.790]  This is the poster for the film.
[45:10.170 --> 45:11.890]  That's also... ignore some of those...
[45:11.890 --> 45:13.910]  Oh wait, that's not the poster.
[45:14.270 --> 45:16.030]  That's something else. We'll talk about that later.
[45:16.470 --> 45:18.570]  You have the sloppiest clipboard etiquette.
[45:18.610 --> 45:21.090]  Hey, no, you know what? Time out from the Mr. Magoo conversation.
[45:21.090 --> 45:25.210]  Can you delete it? Otherwise I'm going to end up posting it to the fucking Instagram in the morning.
[45:26.110 --> 45:27.870]  I won't remember this in a week.
[45:28.070 --> 45:29.490]  We're going to take a pause for a minute.
[45:29.970 --> 45:32.910]  Every time, because I'm doing the drive files, Gavin's always like,
[45:32.910 --> 45:37.150]  Oh, you're getting it wrong. You're getting... Oh, you don't know how to do it.
[45:38.170 --> 45:41.590]  I'm trying to protect you from pasting a dick pic into the Discord.
[45:41.610 --> 45:44.970]  All good today. No acknowledgement.
[45:45.250 --> 45:48.630]  No like, hey, you figured it out. Good job. Good links today.
[45:48.870 --> 45:51.470]  I make one mistake, and he's all about it.
[45:51.470 --> 45:54.670]  If you've done it enough times for me to call out every time, that's more than one.
[45:55.190 --> 45:57.690]  You want him to say good links today?
[45:58.210 --> 46:02.450]  Well, if he's gonna, I'm just saying, if he's going to call me out for it negatively,
[46:02.610 --> 46:05.090]  it'd be nice to get a little, hey, good job, every now and then.
[46:05.210 --> 46:10.130]  Whenever I paste something to someone in a text or something, I never get congratulations.
[46:10.970 --> 46:13.830]  Yeah, but how often are you criticizing them for the links?
[46:15.050 --> 46:19.250]  I'm saying in the event in which you're attacking me for my posting, I want some credit as well.
[46:19.250 --> 46:24.230]  I'm just trying to warn you against blindly pasting stuff into a public chat.
[46:25.090 --> 46:26.830]  Blindly? Like Mr. Magoo?
[46:27.070 --> 46:31.310]  Yeah, so we were arguing, that's exactly what I was going to do too, Eric, about whether he's blind or not.
[46:31.790 --> 46:41.630]  Gavin and I, over the weekend, got together and watched the movie, and the premise was we were going to watch it until we could make a determination on whether or not Mr. Magoo is blind or not.
[46:42.310 --> 46:45.610]  And we'd like to throw that onto the end of this episode.
[46:47.330 --> 46:48.130]  Oh, awesome!
[46:49.210 --> 46:53.010]  Yeah, so we've been sitting on it to throw it in there, so enjoy post-credits.
[46:53.370 --> 46:54.770]  It's a little over 20 minutes.
[46:55.270 --> 46:55.670]  What?!
[46:55.670 --> 46:56.910]  It's going to look like a long episode.
[46:57.190 --> 46:58.290]  Oh my god!
[46:58.650 --> 47:03.570]  Can I ask a question? When you say you watched the movie, are you talking about the Leslie Nielsen Mr. Magoo movie?
[47:03.610 --> 47:04.730]  Or like the original Mr. Magoo?
[47:04.730 --> 47:07.570]  The Leslie Nielsen movie that I put the poster in for.
[47:07.990 --> 47:11.230]  So you think we should put it in this file as opposed to just as a supplemental?
[47:11.910 --> 47:12.590]  I think so.
[47:12.850 --> 47:13.210]  Okay.
[47:14.650 --> 47:16.070]  This book got so weird.
[47:16.190 --> 47:20.250]  Do you have an awareness that Mr. Magoo is an older character than that movie?
[47:20.350 --> 47:21.170]  Yes, absolutely.
[47:21.350 --> 47:22.090]  Okay, good. Just curious.
[47:22.150 --> 47:26.950]  We both viewed the old man, and in my head he had like a monocle and was like,
[47:27.030 --> 47:30.910]  It was what Mr. Magoo was, and Gavin viewed him as a blind guy.
[47:31.190 --> 47:32.590]  So we watched the film to verify.
[47:33.270 --> 47:37.610]  And we get an answer very quickly, and then it just turns into watching Mr. Magoo for 20 seconds.
[47:38.150 --> 47:38.570]  Jesus Christ!
[47:38.570 --> 47:43.490]  It couldn't actually be a more definitive answer as far as it goes.
[47:43.650 --> 47:48.990]  You see from the POV of Mr. Magoo what he sees in the first 20 seconds of the movie.
[47:49.590 --> 47:50.950]  So we cleared it up real quick.
[47:51.570 --> 47:51.890]  We did.
[47:52.690 --> 47:58.690]  So enjoy, and you'll learn about Mr. Magoo, which is just a weird thing all around.
[47:58.750 --> 48:00.370]  I can't actually read the timer at the moment.
[48:00.490 --> 48:01.690]  I was going to say, that's exactly what I read.
[48:01.690 --> 48:02.310]  What do you mean?
[48:03.370 --> 48:05.930]  The timer is under the stroke.
[48:06.290 --> 48:10.410]  The timer is on the right side and is under the hour hand, because it's almost 3 o'clock.
[48:10.510 --> 48:12.530]  So it's kind of... I'll be able to see it again in like a minute.
[48:13.870 --> 48:16.730]  It's a quarter till. It's not almost 3 o'clock.
[48:17.130 --> 48:19.390]  The hour hand is at the 3. Almost.
[48:20.190 --> 48:22.930]  Can't you just ask your watch what the time is at?
[48:23.150 --> 48:24.990]  It's just a bog-standard dumb watch.
[48:26.910 --> 48:27.710]  This is...
[48:27.710 --> 48:29.710]  Okay, okay, I can see it. I can see it.
[48:31.030 --> 48:32.610]  We're at 6 minutes 20 seconds.
[48:32.690 --> 48:40.190]  Okay. Now, Geoff, did you view Mr. Magoo as a blind guy or just an old guy who can't see very far in front of him?
[48:40.610 --> 48:43.250]  He's just an old guy who can't see very far in front of him.
[48:43.430 --> 48:45.110]  Okay, just making sure. Thank you.
[48:46.370 --> 48:47.370]  Yeah, I'd expect Geoff to know.
[48:48.190 --> 48:51.230]  That's my memory, but I'm also not a big Mr. Magoo fan.
[48:51.290 --> 48:55.870]  And I also wasn't aware that Leslie Nielsen did a Mr. Magoo movie that has a little English bulldog in it.
[48:55.990 --> 48:56.810]  It's a Disney movie.
[48:57.410 --> 48:59.690]  Yeah, it was a big movie.
[49:00.050 --> 49:01.730]  It's Jennifer Garner's fourth film.
[49:02.310 --> 49:02.990]  Is it pretty good?
[49:04.630 --> 49:08.850]  I don't think I would describe it as good from what we watched.
[49:09.650 --> 49:10.690]  Has it been 8 minutes?
[49:11.450 --> 49:12.230]  It has to have been.
[49:12.690 --> 49:12.950]  No.
[49:13.970 --> 49:16.050]  How far are we? You just said you didn't know.
[49:18.110 --> 49:18.830]  We're at 7 minutes.
[49:19.510 --> 49:21.130]  Okay, so just 1 minute.
[49:22.090 --> 49:24.850]  We'd actually know how many seconds, but he doesn't have a proper timer.
[49:25.430 --> 49:28.070]  No, I can see the seconds. I couldn't see the minute. It was under the hour.
[49:28.570 --> 49:30.350]  How many seconds do we have left?
[49:30.610 --> 49:31.910]  This is the worst one.
[49:31.910 --> 49:33.330]  We have about 40 seconds left.
[49:35.230 --> 49:37.210]  Does anyone hear splashing?
[49:39.210 --> 49:41.330]  No, I have headphones on. I can't hear anything.
[49:41.630 --> 49:43.230]  Somebody could be robbing my house right now and I wouldn't know.
[49:44.050 --> 49:47.350]  So everyone's gonna go and turn off their boss and then report back about the fill level.
[49:47.810 --> 49:50.230]  Does anybody have a 20 second bit we can go through real fast?
[49:50.730 --> 49:51.130]  No.
[49:55.150 --> 49:56.450]  No, I don't.
[49:56.450 --> 49:57.970]  I got plenty of notes.
[49:58.990 --> 50:03.130]  Was Mr. Magoo related to Rocky and Bullwinkle in any way? I don't think so.
[50:03.370 --> 50:03.750]  I don't think so.
[50:03.750 --> 50:04.710]  No, but they feel similar.
[50:05.150 --> 50:11.350]  Alright, you ready? 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[50:11.590 --> 50:12.010]  8 minutes.
[50:15.050 --> 50:16.150]  Is that 8?
[50:16.470 --> 50:16.710]  Yeah.
[50:17.630 --> 50:19.150]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nailed it.
[50:19.970 --> 50:21.410]  Are you not checking your bath?
[50:22.070 --> 50:22.470]  Who, me?
[50:23.030 --> 50:24.410]  Well, I guess you know because it's 8 minutes.
[50:24.410 --> 50:26.930]  I already dived. I didn't even run it. Was I supposed to participate?
[50:27.510 --> 50:29.610]  No, it's fine. You're right. That makes sense.
[50:30.610 --> 50:33.830]  I just had some bath paranoia that you're trying to trick us in some way.
[50:35.590 --> 50:36.190]  Mine's off.
[50:37.230 --> 50:37.430]  Nice.
[50:37.690 --> 50:39.070]  How was the fill? Good fill level?
[50:39.370 --> 50:40.250]  We'll wait for everyone to get back.
[50:40.590 --> 50:41.030]  Oh, okay.
[50:45.060 --> 50:46.900]  Some people have got some distance to travel.
[50:48.060 --> 50:48.300]  Yeah.
[50:52.860 --> 50:54.420]  Did that Geoff sound like he's dying?
[50:54.820 --> 50:55.540]  No, it's me.
[50:56.160 --> 50:57.000]  No, it's Nick.
[50:57.220 --> 50:57.900]  Oh, Christ.
[50:58.200 --> 50:59.360]  Nick's running an obstacle course.
[50:59.400 --> 50:59.460]  Nick, were you running?
[50:59.780 --> 51:01.040]  Yeah, it's on the other side of the house.
[51:04.160 --> 51:05.920]  That's what you get for living in a mansion, Nick.
[51:05.980 --> 51:09.600]  No, it's one story. Everything laid out far.
[51:12.140 --> 51:13.320]  Alright, how'd everybody do?
[51:15.300 --> 51:16.420]  Who should we start with? Andrew?
[51:16.880 --> 51:17.220]  Yeah.
[51:17.340 --> 51:17.840]  I was filled.
[51:18.700 --> 51:19.120]  It's filled.
[51:19.960 --> 51:23.380]  So you went into the overfilled? You didn't... Was it overfilled?
[51:23.380 --> 51:28.800]  My bath doesn't overflow. The drain drains at a faster rate than it fills.
[51:29.020 --> 51:31.160]  So it was never a concern for me as far as overflow.
[51:31.160 --> 51:32.580]  It drains faster than it fills.
[51:33.100 --> 51:34.960]  Yeah. For the overflow, yeah.
[51:35.340 --> 51:36.440]  What, isn't that the idea of it?
[51:37.000 --> 51:42.960]  Yeah. Well, I'm just... But there are certain... If you... Let's say the water pressure is at max in the middle.
[51:43.200 --> 51:50.440]  So if I put it in the middle temperature, it would go in faster than it could drain.
[51:50.780 --> 51:51.120]  And it would overflow.
[51:51.140 --> 51:51.680]  Oh, really?
[51:52.280 --> 51:52.720]  Yes.
[51:53.140 --> 51:54.740]  That's not right.
[51:55.140 --> 51:56.900]  That's absolutely how it works for mine.
[51:57.140 --> 52:02.280]  So if I go full all the way, like fully twisting it means it's the hottest it will be.
[52:02.400 --> 52:06.000]  It will never overflow because it doesn't go at a fast enough speed.
[52:06.220 --> 52:06.600]  Wow.
[52:07.280 --> 52:10.940]  We didn't specify what temperature we were going at.
[52:11.160 --> 52:12.540]  I just twisted it all the way.
[52:12.900 --> 52:14.340]  I twisted both knobs.
[52:15.260 --> 52:15.920]  Yeah, I just went full bore.
[52:15.920 --> 52:16.660]  I went all the way.
[52:17.160 --> 52:19.480]  Oh, and that seems like an unfair advantage to have two knobs.
[52:19.660 --> 52:20.480]  That's a great point.
[52:20.480 --> 52:22.580]  That's a great point.
[52:23.100 --> 52:25.220]  So everyone went full blast except Andrew.
[52:25.740 --> 52:26.000]  Yeah.
[52:27.580 --> 52:28.540]  So no overflow.
[52:28.920 --> 52:29.900]  Eric, how was yours?
[52:30.100 --> 52:34.920]  Oh, like a little under three quarters because I have low water pressure.
[52:35.360 --> 52:35.620]  Okay.
[52:35.780 --> 52:39.480]  I posted mine. You can see where my... I didn't quite make it to the cutoff.
[52:40.020 --> 52:40.320]  Almost.
[52:40.540 --> 52:40.960]  Interesting.
[52:41.240 --> 52:42.060]  Wow, so you might have...
[52:42.060 --> 52:45.440]  My little guy looks like he's looking down like he's going, oh no, it's coming.
[52:45.620 --> 52:46.620]  He is. Oh, that's exactly...
[52:47.200 --> 52:49.140]  It's kind of like a Mr. Magoo. That's fine.
[52:49.860 --> 52:52.260]  He looks like he's from the movie Robots.
[52:52.300 --> 52:53.140]  He does.
[52:55.160 --> 52:58.860]  It looks very excited to drain the water out of like its mouth.
[52:59.300 --> 53:00.280]  The way that the drain is.
[53:00.400 --> 53:01.540]  I'm going to suck it.
[53:02.240 --> 53:03.260]  Put it in my mouth.
[53:03.340 --> 53:04.100]  Was yours full, Nick?
[53:04.460 --> 53:09.040]  No, it was three inches short of the drainage line.
[53:15.660 --> 53:16.940]  That's pretty spot on.
[53:17.420 --> 53:17.940]  That's great.
[53:17.940 --> 53:22.300]  I love that you remember specific robots from the film Robots.
[53:22.420 --> 53:23.800]  I love that movie as a kid.
[53:23.980 --> 53:25.500]  Even got the pose right.
[53:29.780 --> 53:31.660]  You got a smart tub, Geoff?
[53:32.900 --> 53:33.680]  I wish.
[53:33.800 --> 53:34.240]  Wow.
[53:34.800 --> 53:37.080]  I have a very slow filling tub, apparently.
[53:38.640 --> 53:39.820]  Andrew, what was your life hack?
[53:40.180 --> 53:43.360]  Oh, my life hack. You're going to hate my life hack. You ready for this?
[53:43.600 --> 53:45.920]  You ready for this? Great. It's another order hack.
[53:45.920 --> 53:47.840]  It's another fast food order hack.
[53:47.960 --> 53:49.940]  I thought we decided those weren't life hacks.
[53:50.120 --> 53:50.780]  Did we decide that they were?
[53:50.780 --> 53:51.980]  Hear me out. Hear me out.
[53:51.980 --> 53:53.500]  I'm pitching this.
[53:53.780 --> 53:56.020]  You can thumbs up, thumbs down, life hack or not.
[53:56.440 --> 53:57.280]  I'm just throwing it out there.
[53:58.240 --> 54:04.520]  They have right now Burger King is offering buy one, get one Angry Whopper for free.
[54:04.640 --> 54:06.380]  Buy one, get one free on an Angry Whopper.
[54:06.660 --> 54:08.860]  I'm not a spicy fan.
[54:09.220 --> 54:10.120]  I'm bad with heat.
[54:10.400 --> 54:11.820]  I'm a baby when it comes to spice.
[54:11.900 --> 54:12.680]  Not a big fan of it.
[54:13.220 --> 54:20.960]  But, life hack, you order the Angry Whopper, then request all the spicy stuff off of it.
[54:21.140 --> 54:22.380]  Now you just have a Whopper.
[54:22.580 --> 54:25.440]  Now you're just getting a buy one, get one Whopper, which is a totally different burger.
[54:27.660 --> 54:28.320]  That's the hack?
[54:28.820 --> 54:30.340]  That's the hack. That's the life hack.
[54:33.720 --> 54:34.740]  Thumbs down. That's fine.
[54:34.980 --> 54:36.520]  I think the other hack is definitely better.
[54:36.560 --> 54:38.440]  I just want to throw it out there. I felt like I was hacking them.
[54:38.880 --> 54:41.440]  I was getting a buy one, get one on a deal that wasn't available.
[54:41.440 --> 54:42.480]  Have you tried it with the spice?
[54:42.660 --> 54:44.860]  No, because I'm just not a spice fan, generally.
[54:46.220 --> 54:48.500]  Gracie said, I don't want one Whopper, let alone a second.
[54:49.400 --> 54:50.120]  Yeah, exactly.
[54:50.620 --> 54:52.480]  Okay, well that's fine. You guys live in the U.S.
[54:52.480 --> 54:54.800]  I respect the monarchy as a Canadian.
[54:56.100 --> 55:00.080]  It sounds like I'm the only one that's kind of on board with this.
[55:01.220 --> 55:03.420]  It sounds like an inappropriate life hack to me.
[55:03.540 --> 55:07.240]  You're basically getting a buy one, get one Whopper when that's not available.
[55:07.760 --> 55:08.120]  Exactly.
[55:08.620 --> 55:10.620]  You can make a buy one, get one for anything.
[55:11.100 --> 55:14.200]  If you just customize from the starting point of an angry Whopper.
[55:15.080 --> 55:16.260]  Yeah, what do you mean?
[55:16.600 --> 55:17.340]  Oh, what?
[55:18.100 --> 55:22.800]  If you told me this life hack involved turning an angry Whopper into a chicken sandwich or something,
[55:22.880 --> 55:24.700]  I think I'd be a little bit more on board with it.
[55:24.780 --> 55:25.480]  But I'm with Gracie.
[55:25.620 --> 55:27.940]  Can you sub for chicken?
[55:27.940 --> 55:29.400]  But I can't get the Whopper.
[55:29.740 --> 55:33.680]  If I want to get two Whoppers, I have to pay for both.
[55:33.820 --> 55:37.280]  But under this system, I'm only paying for one.
[55:37.400 --> 55:38.600]  And it's the same thing.
[55:38.600 --> 55:43.360]  Actually, it's a bonus because this comes with crispy onions, which are not spicy.
[55:43.520 --> 55:44.740]  And I love some crispy onions.
[55:45.380 --> 55:46.760]  So you're just getting a Whopper with crispy onions?
[55:46.760 --> 55:49.520]  Well, I could remove the crispy onions if I wanted to,
[55:49.600 --> 55:52.760]  but now I'm getting an elevated Whopper for the price of one.
[55:52.980 --> 55:54.620]  I still agree with you.
[55:55.180 --> 55:57.620]  I'm on board with you, but this has given me an idea.
[55:58.700 --> 56:00.740]  It reminded me of this thing I know Eric remembers,
[56:01.500 --> 56:03.540]  where on the Howard Stern Show, they would do prank calls.
[56:03.620 --> 56:06.500]  They would call a pizza restaurant and they'd order a pepperoni pizza.
[56:06.500 --> 56:08.640]  And they'd be like, hold the pepperoni, hold the cheese.
[56:08.980 --> 56:10.820]  And they'd be like, do you just want bread?
[56:11.020 --> 56:11.940]  And they're like, no, hold the bread.
[56:12.180 --> 56:14.000]  And then the guys would hang up on them and get pissed off at them.
[56:14.380 --> 56:21.340]  How much could we fundamentally change an item with substitutions
[56:21.680 --> 56:24.880]  and have it still be considered a buyable as that item?
[56:25.640 --> 56:29.500]  Like, could you turn a Whopper into a salad and still have it be a Whopper?
[56:29.560 --> 56:30.900]  Or a fish filet?
[56:30.900 --> 56:35.960]  If he did this and then replaced the other one with a chicken sandwich,
[56:36.680 --> 56:41.680]  where, like, just got crazy on the deal, I think this would be a great life hack.
[56:41.880 --> 56:46.040]  So if I asked for extra lettuce and removed everything else,
[56:46.200 --> 56:47.980]  I have a salad, is what you're saying, essentially?
[56:48.160 --> 56:51.100]  And the base for a salad. And it comes with bacon as well.
[56:51.440 --> 56:52.800]  So I could have bacon in my salad.
[56:53.100 --> 56:57.900]  But I would lack dressing, unless you consider mayo to be an appropriate salad dressing.
[56:58.360 --> 57:02.240]  Yeah, I think if you can get that, but on the receipt it still says Whopper,
[57:02.620 --> 57:04.020]  then I think that's a win.
[57:05.260 --> 57:08.880]  I think they have salad at Burger King, so you could also ask for, like,
[57:08.880 --> 57:11.280]  could I get some Thousand Island on the side or whatever, too?
[57:12.620 --> 57:15.920]  I'm gonna do some research into this. I will come back with a modification.
[57:16.380 --> 57:17.540]  I'll look around at the options.
[57:17.600 --> 57:21.460]  Maybe we should all get in the lab and see who can modify the most.
[57:21.760 --> 57:22.540]  Yeah, let's do it.
[57:23.920 --> 57:26.740]  Maybe any fast food place is available.
[57:27.420 --> 57:29.940]  Yeah, anyone that you could get that works for you.
[57:30.080 --> 57:32.560]  And next episode we'll circle back on this.
[57:32.680 --> 57:37.860]  We could all go to Geoff's house and present our meals to everyone and have them guess what it is.
[57:40.120 --> 57:42.500]  This was two Whoppers.
[57:43.680 --> 57:49.580]  Man, that's gonna take some research. I gotta figure this out.
[57:49.660 --> 57:51.460]  We gotta get creative with this. This is great.
[57:51.960 --> 57:54.440]  Next episode or whatever, we'll do this.
[57:54.440 --> 57:57.340]  I wanna submit it and then we can do the guess. I love that idea as a game.
[57:59.740 --> 58:03.260]  Speaking of next episode, can I propose an idea for an upcoming episode?
[58:03.840 --> 58:05.540]  Of course. Is it for 196?
[58:05.840 --> 58:09.300]  It's not for 196, which is something we should probably talk about because we're two episodes away from that.
[58:09.860 --> 58:16.220]  But you know how we have tried ways to enhance our creativity and make the show better?
[58:16.540 --> 58:21.820]  Most recently we did the Icy Hot on the balls and the ears to sharpen our senses.
[58:22.720 --> 58:27.100]  Well, I was thinking about that and I was thinking about Daredevil in specific.
[58:27.780 --> 58:32.320]  And that got me wondering, since we always describe F***face as theater of the mind, right?
[58:32.380 --> 58:36.020]  We think the strength of the podcast is that we're all separate.
[58:36.580 --> 58:42.060]  I'll be honest with you, I think the real strength of the podcast is that we're all 30 seconds away from a tub that we can fill up.
[58:42.320 --> 58:46.360]  But we're all in separate places so when we're describing things to each other, it's all theater of the mind, right?
[58:46.880 --> 58:51.480]  And I think it makes it easier for the audience to get on the vibe, right?
[58:51.480 --> 58:55.400]  What if we blindfolded ourselves for an entire episode?
[58:56.120 --> 59:00.520]  So it's like those restaurants you go in where they turn all the lights off and you just eat in the dark.
[59:00.660 --> 59:04.100]  So you're fully immersed and you're fully experiencing your other senses.
[59:04.380 --> 59:14.500]  And if we were to do that enough, do you think we could develop like Daredevil style podcasting skills that make us like metahumans almost?
[59:15.100 --> 59:17.160]  No, but I'd like to do it.
[59:17.160 --> 59:20.380]  I'll definitely try it. It's like a face off during dark.
[59:21.740 --> 59:28.960]  It's something I have considered because it's the same experience as like a listener has as far as if they're just plainly listening.
[59:29.140 --> 59:34.620]  So I've wanted to try that to see like what that experience is like while making the show.
[59:34.840 --> 59:38.400]  So I think this is a great opportunity for us all to do it. I love the idea, Geoff.
[59:38.520 --> 59:44.160]  I think it'll force a level of focus too. Like we won't be able to trade images back and forth or if we do, we won't be able to see them.
[59:45.640 --> 59:53.720]  But like I know even when we're like when we're recording, I'm looking for like the picture of my bloody hand on my phone and I drop the conversation with you guys for a second.
[59:53.880 --> 59:57.200]  I got to try to figure out how to pick it back up or I get distracted by my notes or something.
[59:57.360 --> 01:00:02.920]  And I get taken away from the podcast just for a second, you know, and then you always have to kind of like find your way back in.
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:09.440]  And this would eliminate all of that. We would be just solely focused on what everybody else is talking about and we would have no distractions.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.380]  Who do you think will fall asleep first?
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:20.800]  Oh, me immediately. I was about to say. I got a fucking my eye mask is so comfy. It's a weighted eye mask. I'm crashing 10 minutes in.
[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:25.800]  You're like birds. Gracie also said that she would fall asleep. What the fuck?
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:27.440]  You're like birds.
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:29.700]  Oh, are we talking about the bird thing?
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:33.680]  Yeah. Speaking of birds, we have the Falcon merch coming out.
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.080]  It's so cool.
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:39.980]  I'm very excited for the shoulder Falcon that we're going to have.
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:42.620]  And all of it is awesome.
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:46.920]  We've we tried to get a Falcon.
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:50.040]  We had a line on a Falcon.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.960]  We've been working this angle for a while. We're very excited about it.
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:07.260]  We've learned a lot about Falconry and governmental regulations regarding the commercial licensing and use of such Falcons.
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.020]  For promotional purposes.
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:14.900]  So we wanted a Falcon to do Falcon tricks and Gracie is still on this.
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.180]  We might. There might still be Falcon tricks. I'm very excited.
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:27.540]  The problem that we ran into is that we found out that there are certain Falcons due to government regulations.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.500]  Let me read this here.
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:38.500]  Unfortunately, federal law is specific on which species can and can't be used commercially like a fucking tractor.
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:43.500]  And I don't have any birds right now that could be used for promotion.
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:46.000]  He has unfilmable Falcons.
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:48.480]  He has unfilmable Falcons.
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:54.800]  But if you buy a shoulder Falcon from us, film it as much as you want.
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:58.040]  We deem our Falcons ultra filmable.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:01.400]  We only sell filmable Falcons.
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:05.600]  Surely we just make a donation to his Falcons.
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:08.900]  And that way we're not paying for the service of the Falcon.
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:15.240]  Yeah, but the Falcon can't be used in the manufacturing of promotional materials.
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:21.180]  So the problem isn't the transaction. The problem is that the Falcon appears in the promotional content.
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:30.120]  Which is, you know, thanks government for really getting in there in the weeds and working on the important issues.
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:38.280]  Making sure the people out there across our great nation aren't using Falcons for ill-gotten promotional gain.
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:43.340]  I assume it's to protect the species. Maybe it's stressful for a Falcon or for those types of Falcons.
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:45.180]  It probably is. There's probably a very good reason for it.
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:48.100]  He's already got the Falcon and he's already doing this with the Falcon.
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:53.780]  I think Gavin brought it up right after we talked about it a little bit earlier.
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:58.980]  That there are more protections on Falcons being filmed than there are probably children.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:06.940]  And that's, I feel, very true with all the YouTube channels that I've seen where people film their entire families.
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:11.060]  Who's got the least skeletons in their closet amongst us right now?
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:13.300]  That's American. Sorry, Gavin.
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:15.920]  What the fuck are you about to ask?
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:20.100]  I'm going somewhere. Who's got the least skeletons in their closet? It's clearly not me.
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:21.700]  Nick. Gracie.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.280]  Okay, Gracie.
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:26.860]  Alright, Gracie or Nick?
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:28.840]  It's definitely not Eric.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.360]  Cut all of this out. What is this?
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.680]  No, no, no. Here's what we do.
[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:37.040]  No, don't be scared. Here's what we do.
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:41.880]  If we want to fix this, it's a long play, but we start now.
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:47.420]  We get Nick or Gracie elected to some sort of local government.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:51.960]  Then we eventually get them to state. Maybe state congress, state senator.
[01:03:52.340 --> 01:04:01.800]  Then national. Then when you're a U.S. senator or a U.S. congressperson, you can push through legislation that makes it legal for us to film with Falcons.
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:13.540]  I just want to point out, what you started there, who has the least skeletons in their closet, is 100% not necessary for what your plan ended up being.
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:17.180]  Well, you know, it gets a lot of muck raking in politics, man.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:24.580]  Yeah, I don't know if you've paid attention to politics in any time in the last 10 years, but not super concerned with anything you just laid out.
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:34.000]  Well, I guess it depends on who your political affiliation is, but I would just rather run a clean campaign here, guys, if I'm being honest with you.
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:36.280]  I want to live above the fray.
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.640]  Much like a Falcon does.
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:42.740]  When they go low, we go high. How about that?
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:51.780]  I love that they made the little tag on the Falcon plush look like the sign, which is also being reordered as part of this.
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:05:01.580]  The Falcon stuff... I think the Falcon stuff is already out by the time this episode is out.
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:07.380]  Or it comes out... when does this episode come out? I think it's mid-February when the Falcon stuff comes out.
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:11.300]  Yeah, like two weeks, and the Falcon stuff comes out next week, at the time of this recording.
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:12.520]  Oh, really?
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:13.740]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:20.740]  So, clip this, and we'll just release this part for Falcon promotion.
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:28.680]  I feel like, speaking of stuff that's out, I've never seen more positive comments on anything we've made than the topic, Does It Do?
[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:30.560]  Oh, it's so funny.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:36.480]  So, yeah, Does It Do is coming out. Make sure you watch it on the F*** Face channel.
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:42.940]  Yeah, I think we've got a bunch ahead of us still. I can't even remember the products we used.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:46.020]  Well, there was all those ones that we didn't want to do, but other than that...
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:47.080]  Don't start that fight.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:50.120]  Speaking of...
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:50.480]  With the desks?
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:55.700]  Desks, super positive. Everyone liked the desks. I thought that was great. Gracie was proved wrong.
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:57.580]  Big fan of that.
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:58.840]  Whatever.
[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:03.260]  You better be careful. That's Senator Gracie to you.
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:04.240]  Oh, no.
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:08.060]  As soon as I change the Texas penal code, you're out.
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:11.940]  Positive reception.
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.320]  Imagine having two penals.
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:15.180]  Jesus Christ.
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:27.900]  At Regulation LP on Twitter, we changed the old Achievement Hunter social to be a Let's Play social.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:31.220]  Andrew led that and everyone's so on board.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:35.400]  Everyone's so on board with this. It's fantastic. I love it. I'm so happy.
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.600]  Why do you sound sarcastic?
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:39.100]  It did sound sarcastic.
[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:42.980]  Did it? Hang on. How do I say it so it doesn't sound sarcastic?
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:44.640]  You can't. It's impossible.
[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.480]  Imagine you're reading your vows at your wedding.
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:49.680]  I'm so happy.
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:56.980]  I'm thrilled with what's happening on our...
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.160]  What am I supposed to say?
[01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:00.240]  Hey, Eric.
[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:01.680]  You're getting closer.
[01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:03.580]  You definitely are improving.
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:09.720]  I think what's happening on our Let's Play Twitter channel is so great.
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:12.700]  No, I buy that.
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:13.440]  I buy that.
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.540]  I'm on board with that.
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:20.420]  I'm genuinely excited reading the comments where everyone's really positive about it.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:22.640]  People are way into this and it's because Andrew went,
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:23.760]  Hey, check this out.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.100]  We're just going to post clips here.
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:29.120]  We're not trying to be Achievement Hunter. This is just the thing we're taking.
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:30.640]  And everyone went, great.
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:33.540]  So did Let's Play not have a social account?
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:34.820]  Oh, I have no idea.
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.020]  I don't think so.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:37.580]  Beats me.
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:38.140]  Really?
[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:40.240]  Beats me and also I don't care.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:43.480]  It was Gavin's job to make that social account.
[01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:46.640]  This is what he finds out 12 years later that he didn't do it.
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:53.680]  I believe the first clip we're sharing is from Jack at the Super Bowl.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:57.440]  That's great.
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:07:59.580]  Oh, man.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:00.340]  This is a lot of fun.
[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:01.780]  So episode...
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:02.520]  This was a good one.
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:06.140]  Episode 196 is coming up in two episodes.
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:07.740]  This is 194, right?
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:10.700]  We said it was going to be the greatest episode of all time.
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:13.700]  So we probably should ensure that.
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:14.280]  Oh, I'm ready.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.000]  I'm prepared.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:15.820]  Okay.
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:18.260]  So you have something that you've prepared.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.160]  I have stuff.
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:25.620]  Yeah, I assumed it would be like every other episode of the show that we've done where we all come up with stuff and then do it on the show.
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:26.880]  So I'm prepared.
[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:27.620]  Okay.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:30.840]  Gavin, do you have a 196 idea prepared?
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:31.600]  No.
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:32.880]  I don't either.
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.960]  I think I'm the one that said that I would have it figured out, too.
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:38.240]  I haven't had a single idea once ever.
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:46.220]  It was a thing where I think you guys brought it up after recording last week and I went, oh, fuck.
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:49.160]  And then thankfully, something immediately came to mind.
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:51.940]  So I feel good about my 196 plans.
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:53.260]  All right.
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:54.900]  Well, you heard it here first.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.580]  Andrew's taking the lead on 196.
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.140]  He's providing all the entertainment.
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:00.700]  We're just going to hang back and watch and enjoy it with the audience.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.300]  It was your idea, I think, right?
[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:04.500]  196 would be a big one.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:10.780]  It sounds like I bequeathed the idea to you and it sounds like it's in your more than capable hands.
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:16.340]  Listen, you've done some amazing moments on the show from getting the tattoo while we're recording.
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:18.120]  I'm sure you both will come up with stuff.
[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:19.260]  That's a great point.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:22.800]  I'm not going to be able to top the shit I've already done, so I probably shouldn't.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:27.240]  Anything that I attempted would be lame and do a disservice to the show.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:28.460]  So I probably should just hang back.
[01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:35.320]  We do need to wrap this up because we are going a little bit long and we have an additional 20 minutes that's going on at the end of this.
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:40.620]  So we should probably put a little pin on this one.
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:42.620]  All right, I guess everyone go take their bath.
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:46.020]  Gracie is draining her tub.
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:47.640]  Oh, you didn't want to take a bath?
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:48.620]  Well, that was a waste of water.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:53.220]  No, I didn't. I got carried away by the conversation, so I never drained it.
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:53.520]  Yay!
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:54.660]  Oh, good.
[01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:58.700]  All right, well, I'll talk to you guys later, maybe from the bath.
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:09:59.660]  Sounds good.
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:00.340]  Bathy tubby?
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:05.000]  We're just not doing an outro.
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:05.680]  Wait, what?
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:06.240]  Oh, wait.
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:12.320]  Splash, splash.
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.580]  We'll see you guys next week.
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.980]  Thanks for listening to f***facepod.com.
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:24.560]  Don't forget to watch everything we've ever made and listen to everything else that we've ever made.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.060]  Bye.
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:25.840]  Bye.
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:26.820]  I got a chair!
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:27.660]  Bath time!
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:32.500]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F***face.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:36.120]  Once again, the team was late recording, so here are some predictions.
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:38.100]  Where was the Monopoly money?
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:39.660]  Gavin gets a bird.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.020]  Hatton goes hardcore with Let's Play.
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:43.700]  Geoff meets another ghost.
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:45.100]  Eric yells at something.
[01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:47.120]  Nick is not in the mask.
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:48.480]  Gracie can't say no.
[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:50.920]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:53.920]  All that and more on next week's episode of F***face.
[01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:10.330]  Hello, and welcome to a weird... I think this is going to get thrown onto the back of the episode.
[01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:15.690]  I think we'll bring it up in the next one we record, then we can throw this in as like a bonus post-credit thing.
[01:11:16.450 --> 01:11:18.350]  We have, uh, we're going to solve something.
[01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:23.690]  We have been speculating, the two of us, Gavin and I both know the existence of Mr. Magoo.
[01:11:24.290 --> 01:11:28.750]  But there is a clear difference in our belief of, like, who he is as a character.
[01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:31.370]  I think he can see and is just a klutz.
[01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:33.170]  Gavin, you think he's blind?
[01:11:33.370 --> 01:11:41.190]  Well, yeah, I just feel like I've heard Mr. Magoo thrown out in conversation for people who can't, like, if you miss something or if you, like, as if you're blind.
[01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:44.490]  But I don't, I've never looked into the character.
[01:11:44.810 --> 01:11:52.130]  In my head, he's a small, little, bald guy, uh, with a two, like, uh, not a toupee, what's the, a monocle.
[01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:55.930]  And he goes, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr.
[01:11:55.930 --> 01:11:57.150]  And he's just a klutz.
[01:11:57.530 --> 01:11:59.950]  But I don't know, I don't think I've seen him in anything.
[01:11:59.950 --> 01:12:03.930]  I've just seen his image, and I think, I don't even know if he makes those noises.
[01:12:04.190 --> 01:12:05.750]  This is something that I've just kind of manufactured.
[01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:08.150]  I don't even think I've seen his image.
[01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:09.350]  I think I've just heard it.
[01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:11.690]  And I've just had context clues for blindness.
[01:12:12.490 --> 01:12:15.370]  But I feel like blindness could also be klutziness.
[01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:18.950]  I feel like you could be misinterpreting... I don't know.
[01:12:19.170 --> 01:12:24.790]  But we're gonna find out, because there is a Mr. Magoo movie starring Leslie Nielsen, 1997.
[01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:27.750]  We are gonna hit play at the same time.
[01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:32.910]  And then we're gonna just go until we can make a determination and see who's right.
[01:12:33.190 --> 01:12:34.130]  If Mr. Magoo's blind.
[01:12:34.370 --> 01:12:39.070]  Because I even looked at the poster, and it's him taking a step off a building.
[01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:45.690]  But once again, I can't read if he's just a klutz, and it's like he's posing so he doesn't notice that the edge is there.
[01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:47.750]  Or if he's blind. And that's why.
[01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:49.510]  So I'm gonna hit play.
[01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:51.830]  This is gonna be...
[01:12:53.330 --> 01:12:54.510]  3... 2... 1...
[01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:55.930]  Hit play.
[01:12:56.570 --> 01:12:57.130]  Oh no!
[01:12:57.570 --> 01:13:01.430]  This program includes negative depictions and our mistreatment of people and cultures.
[01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:04.790]  These stereotypes were wrong, then are wrong now.
[01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:07.830]  Rather than remove this content, we want to acknowledge its harmful impact.
[01:13:08.170 --> 01:13:10.270]  Learn from... Okay, well, they didn't give me enough time to read it all.
[01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:12.770]  I still don't know if that means he's blind or not.
[01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:15.690]  Or if, because it's 97, they're just culturally insensitive.
[01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:16.370]  I think that tells us everything.
[01:13:16.370 --> 01:13:20.210]  I think that tells us he's blind, and they did a piss-poor job of it.
[01:13:20.210 --> 01:13:25.470]  I don't know, because Leslie Nielsen has played characters of different ethnicities.
[01:13:25.650 --> 01:13:28.550]  Like, I don't... I could be, like, a face thing.
[01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:30.970]  Oh, okay. Alright, well, I'm on second zero.
[01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:31.790]  Let's see.
[01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:32.290]  Should we do play?
[01:13:33.130 --> 01:13:35.510]  You're on second zero? Okay, let me go back.
[01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:37.470]  Let me go back to second zero.
[01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:41.490]  Okay, ready? And I'm gonna do another 3, 2, 1, play.
[01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:42.370]  And on play...
[01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:45.310]  3... 2... 1...
[01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:45.570]  Play.
[01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:48.590]  Oh, we got the castle?
[01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:49.410]  Disney Castle!
[01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:53.490]  I love... this is my favorite castle. I think it's because it was from my childhood.
[01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:55.150]  I love that logo.
[01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:57.570]  You don't like all the fancy CG one with the fireworks?
[01:13:58.050 --> 01:14:00.570]  It's really pretty, but it just... it doesn't hit the same...
[01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:02.930]  Oh, we got a plimp!
[01:14:03.530 --> 01:14:04.610]  That's a plimp, right?
[01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:12.590]  I wonder how many minutes into this film are we gonna see something, uh, offensive or insensitive.
[01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:18.210]  Two minutes? I bet you it takes less time for that than it for us to learn if he's blind or not.
[01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:19.650]  Whoa, we got eyes!
[01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:21.010]  Wait...
[01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:21.970]  That's the guy you pictured.
[01:14:22.410 --> 01:14:23.810]  Is this movie animated?
[01:14:25.650 --> 01:14:28.190]  It's not animated, right? Because we've seen so many...
[01:14:28.190 --> 01:14:28.470]  No.
[01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:30.550]  I think the show is maybe animated?
[01:14:30.890 --> 01:14:33.250]  So this is like the original animated show, I guess.
[01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:35.670]  Oh, yes! You can see!
[01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:37.710]  He just has shit eyes!
[01:14:38.210 --> 01:14:39.710]  He must be legally blind.
[01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:45.950]  I can't believe that we... how far into this are we?
[01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:46.830]  Oh, he opened his eyes!
[01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:54.210]  We're like... we're like a minute in, and not only did we get a clear answer, it was POV from what he sees.
[01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:56.950]  It couldn't have been more definitive.
[01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:59.850]  So is this, like, the original voice actor for Magoo?
[01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:01.510]  I think it's Leslie Nielsen.
[01:15:01.770 --> 01:15:02.870]  Oh. Okay.
[01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:05.410]  Jennifer Garner's in this!
[01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:11.310]  Malcolm McDowell? There's, like, real actors in this!
[01:15:11.310 --> 01:15:13.650]  I wonder how much this movie cost.
[01:15:14.250 --> 01:15:16.370]  Do you think they went all out for Mr. Magoo?
[01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:19.030]  Like, they thought this would be a huge hit, because it is Disney.
[01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:20.650]  Oh, it's based on Mr. Magoo.
[01:15:21.610 --> 01:15:22.930]  I appreciate the clarification.
[01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:25.410]  Remember when they put credits at the beginning?
[01:15:25.850 --> 01:15:28.730]  So he owns his own canon company?
[01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:30.230]  Yeah, that's the thing of the past, isn't it?
[01:15:30.250 --> 01:15:31.050]  Oh, that was, like, CG.
[01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:35.270]  Okay. See, I could understand why you'd think he was blind.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:43.260]  Mr. Magoo is kind of me, where he needs glasses, but just refuses to wear them.
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:45.740]  Do you need glasses?
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:49.840]  Oh, yeah. I can't see anything at a distance.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:50.240]  Are you serious?
[01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:53.280]  Oh, I'm so blind at a distance.
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:55.800]  Why don't you get glasses?
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:59.240]  I can't find a pair that fit my nose right.
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:03.820]  My unbreakable nose evades even the clasp of glasses.
[01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:05.180]  Uniform can help.
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:07.600]  I need the goggles. I've talked about it before.
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:12.960]  I'd love if goggles were a thing that people accepted in fashion.
[01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:15.860]  Or have we already entered an offensive thing?
[01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:17.240]  Oh, here we go!
[01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:18.700]  Wow, what a blend.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:22.120]  I think they did get the old voice.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.740]  The voice has changed.
[01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:27.360]  What do you think the plot of this movie could possibly be?
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:29.320]  A heist.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.340]  You think it's a heist?
[01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:32.660]  Could be a heist for that.
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:35.600]  Oh, are we going to get Mr. Magoo in Payday 3?
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:37.160]  It's a DLC character.
[01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:39.680]  The Magoo mask.
[01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:42.080]  Oh, what's his name?
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.660]  Whatever happened to that haircut?
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:49.280]  There is a great thing about watching 90s movies.
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:52.260]  It's the hair that is no longer with us.
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:55.480]  There should be an immemorium for hair.
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.180]  Like at the Oscars.
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:59.420]  The looks that no longer continued.
[01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:01.660]  She had a spare bike tire for a hat.
[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:03.120]  Oh, is he in the...
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:04.280]  Is he in the closet?
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:14.640]  I love that there is a time in which the world decided Leslie Nielsen should be a star.
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.160]  Oh, it's Garner!
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:18.560]  Oh, no.
[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:21.160]  Oh, jeez.
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:22.220]  I'm concerned.
[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:24.200]  Oh, no!
[01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:25.900]  What is going on?
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:27.840]  I feel like...
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:30.700]  I feel like she's... I don't...
[01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:32.780]  Is she supposed to be a different culture?
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:33.980]  I'm assuming.
[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:36.380]  It seems like what she's going for.
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:39.440]  But it feels like they know it's a bad idea.
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:43.160]  I wonder how far into her career is this?
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:46.360]  This is pre-Alias, right?
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.360]  Let me look it up.
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:52.360]  Alias was 2001, so this is four years before that.
[01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:56.800]  I don't think they did the balding right for the Leslie Nielsen.
[01:17:57.180 --> 01:17:58.760]  I think he has too much hair.
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:02.720]  I think what's weird about it is there's no fade to it.
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:04.320]  It's just a harsh end.
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:06.980]  Oh, no.
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:10.940]  So he's just a rich dude because he has a cannery?
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:13.120]  Jesus.
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.880]  Jesus Christ!
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:24.240]  Who is this movie for?
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:25.740]  I don't know.
[01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:29.120]  Is it a kid's movie?
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:34.740]  I think it's supposed to be, but what kid is excited about Mr. Magoo?
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.740]  The problem is there's no evolution of jokes.
[01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:44.020]  It's just the same thing over and over again.
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:46.060]  Oh, you're right!
[01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:47.840]  Holy shit, Gavin.
[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:50.380]  Dude. Heist!
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.900]  That looks like Geoff when he put the balaclava on.
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:56.560]  When his nose came through the eye?
[01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:56.860]  Yeah.
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:02.340]  Oh, that's what he should have done.
[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:06.240]  That was a pretty dramatic camera move for nothing happening.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.540]  This is like Jennifer Garner's third film.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:10.420]  Wow.
[01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:12.520]  Oh shit, we're back in payday.
[01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:15.040]  It's so fitting that we're watching this.
[01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:19.180]  Why... they got a real superhero thing going on.
[01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:21.540]  Good lord, that's Alan's turn.
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:25.440]  It's like Lady Gaga at the Superbowl.
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:31.720]  That also can't be the most effective way to do this.
[01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:35.180]  That's such a stupid plan!
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:37.800]  This is the swing and then spray paint it.
[01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:46.140]  I think it would be really fun to be a security guard who worked at a place where this happened.
[01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:51.000]  Having to be like, I don't know where the dinosaur... they stole the dinos... I don't know.
[01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:52.660]  I was just doing my rounds.
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:58.140]  I like that people always go for the spraying or the covering of cameras when...
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:00.060]  Just shine a laser at it.
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:01.200]  Just wreck the sensor.
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:04.320]  Does that work?
[01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:05.000]  Yeah!
[01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:12.780]  I always like the low budget Mission Impossible 3 where they take a photo of what the camera should be seeing and then just put that in front of the camera.
[01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:18.300]  So they're going for that diamond? Yeah.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:19.420]  Is it a diamond?
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:20.600]  I think so.
[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:21.280]  Is it a big ruby?
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.180]  Oh yeah, ruby, diamond. It's all...
[01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:26.200]  Those words are all interchangeable to me.
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.940]  I guess...
[01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:29.700]  Look at that smoke!
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:33.020]  Holy shit!
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.760]  He went from Payday to Ark!
[01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:38.720]  Oh, we're speeding up the footage!
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:40.400]  To the Flintstones!
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:44.000]  Oh no!
[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:48.740]  Our exhibit broke, so let's have the quietest noisemaker go off.
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:50.360]  Did he just come?
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:53.880]  The subtitles indicated so.
[01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:57.740]  Are they...
[01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:01.600]  Is the whole plot of this that they think Mr. Magoose stole the thing?
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:04.100]  Like he gets framed for this?
[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:07.220]  Not even framed, just...
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:08.300]  Oh.
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:15.600]  Even when it's not funny, Leslie Nielsen is just a delight.
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:17.100]  I just love watching Leslie...
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:17.880]  Oh shit!
[01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:22.780]  We've got like proper boings and dongs sound effects.
[01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:23.880]  This is...
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:26.740]  This must be for ages 5 to 10.
[01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:28.060]  It has to be.
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:30.280]  Do you think anyone grew up loving this movie?
[01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:33.180]  Do you think there are regulation listeners or comment leavers that are like,
[01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:35.800]  I fuck with Mr. Magoo. This is my film.
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:37.780]  This car's called the Goo.
[01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:38.860]  I bet there is.
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:44.100]  I bet there is, because I like some real dog shit, just because I liked it as a kid.
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:49.620]  Oh, that's so funny. I like that detail, that it's like a magnifying glass for a windshield.
[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:52.860]  Magoo's eggplant that moves.
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:56.200]  Oh, it's Magoo's dog.
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:57.320]  Oh, it's Arty.
[01:22:02.890 --> 01:22:04.130]  Oh, that'd be great.
[01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:05.330]  Pisses like a human.
[01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:05.730]  I'd love to have a pissed dog.
[01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:08.230]  You'd love a pissed dog?
[01:22:08.650 --> 01:22:10.690]  I'd love a pissed dog that can piss in the toilet.
[01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:12.090]  Pissed boy's pissed dog?
[01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:19.010]  Oh, what's wrong with his head? Is it like a cap that makes his head...
[01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:21.970]  There's just something that's not right about Leslie Nielsen's head in this.
[01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:26.570]  You'd think to make a guy who's old as hell with white hair slightly bolder,
[01:22:26.690 --> 01:22:29.870]  you'd think that'd be a simple task, but somehow they struggled with it.
[01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:31.490]  Oh, he's going fishing?
[01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:34.890]  I think that's just how he looks, or maybe he is going...
[01:22:35.490 --> 01:22:36.390]  Oh, God.
[01:22:37.550 --> 01:22:39.530]  Angus is just saving his life.
[01:22:39.550 --> 01:22:40.730]  The dog just saves him, yeah.
[01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:44.890]  Look at the nice finish on the goo.
[01:22:48.290 --> 01:22:52.970]  Dude, my vision is so bad, both times when I was doing the written driving test,
[01:22:53.050 --> 01:22:55.050]  I almost failed on the eye part.
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:02.760]  I was going to say, how is he going to have a license, but then I realized I got one.
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:06.560]  I'll get the music.
[01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:08.720]  Because he can't.
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:10.380]  Oh, Angus.
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:17.700]  Oh, it's like a country's jewel.
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:20.560]  You think Jennifer Garner's the bad guy?
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:22.280]  Oh, it's Tobolowsky.
[01:23:24.310 --> 01:23:28.260]  You ever hear him talk about working with Steven Seagal?
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:29.260]  No.
[01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:33.580]  I wish I remembered what the name of the movie was,
[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:40.340]  but he was in a movie with Steven Seagal, and Seagal had to kill him in the first scene of the film.
[01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:44.900]  He was like a serial killer, and Seagal went into a church and gunned him down.
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:48.480]  And Seagal decided that he didn't want to kill people anymore,
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:53.240]  that it was against his faith to murder anyone, even on film.
[01:23:54.020 --> 01:24:00.760]  And so he had to go through this extensive process of convincing Steven Seagal
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:03.320]  that his character was okay to kill.
[01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:06.940]  Because, essentially, he eventually got him by saying,
[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:09.180]  do you believe in reincarnation? And he said yes.
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:12.380]  And he's like, well, this guy is in absolute misery.
[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:16.680]  You're freeing him from this body and allowing him to move on.
[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:20.820]  And so they filmed the scene, and then, like, a month later,
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:23.160]  he got a call from the director, and the director was like,
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:27.440]  every single scene after we film your scene,
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:32.000]  Steven Seagal keeps improvising a line about how your character isn't dead,
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:34.660]  and that he's, I'm glad I didn't kill that guy.
[01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:38.800]  So they had to bring him back to record audio of him going,
[01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:42.040]  oh, I'm alive! Like, essentially.
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:46.020]  That's terrible. What a pain in the ass.
[01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:48.760]  I've never seen the film, but I just want to see it just for that.
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:50.320]  Okay, we're going, uh...
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.120]  We got toothpaste on the sunscreen.
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:56.040]  Do you think when you make a Magoo movie, you just, like, sit in a room and go,
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:00.060]  like, what can he misinterpret for what, and then you shape the script around that?
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:02.280]  You just look around your bedroom for the plot of the movie.
[01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:06.260]  Oh, I wonder if you'll slip on a sushi container.
[01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:11.520]  Was that guy in Pitch Black? Is that where I recognize that guy? Is he in Riddick?
[01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:12.860]  I haven't seen that.
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.640]  Oh, really? You haven't seen Pitch Black?
[01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:16.320]  No.
[01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:17.120]  That's surprising.
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:18.920]  Is she gonna toss him?
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:22.540]  She should! I don't know why you would hire him in the first place.
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:24.020]  Like, Detroit.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.160]  Oh, yeah, there we go. They made the same joke.
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:30.440]  The S.S. Magoo.
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:33.580]  I think the best part of this movie is the names of his vehicles.
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:35.780]  Just everything is Magoo-themed.
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.200]  Oh, do you think he's gonna land in the S.S. Magoo?
[01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:40.400]  I've decided what prop I want.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.700]  The best prop to have from a movie is that star jewel.
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:46.060]  Oh, no!
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:47.580]  Holy shit!
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:50.040]  Magoo's gonna get it!
[01:25:52.860 --> 01:26:05.980]  Okay, so the plot of this movie is a country's jewel is stolen, and in an attempt to backstab each other, they accidentally throw the jewel onto Mr. Magoo's head.
[01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:08.520]  Oh, is he gonna catch it by the goolies?
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:10.320]  Holy shit!
[01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:15.020]  I'm Mr. Magoo, and this is Jackass!
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:18.860]  Welcome to cruise ship fishing!
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:24.940]  Is he gonna pull him in and be like, ah, I got a big one?
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:27.620]  Did he yell out a Moby Dick reference?
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:28.720]  Oh, there we go.
[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:36.000]  We should probably stop watching this scene.
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:39.900]  We're like 30 minutes of recording for the back half of an episode.
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:50.120]  Let's go, we got... I got like 1736, so let's go to 20. Let's go like two and a half more minutes.
[01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:50.340]  Okay.
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:53.340]  Oh, man.
[01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:55.500]  And we learned quickly.
[01:26:56.900 --> 01:27:03.740]  Instantly. I thought it would be like we'd go back and forth, and maybe we'd have to argue about whether that indicates one way or the other.
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:07.820]  I can't believe I was actually right. That's a very rare thing.
[01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:11.060]  What year did Mr. Magoo come out?
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:12.560]  Like the original?
[01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:14.500]  I guess it's getting the fuck out. Yeah.
[01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:16.300]  Original? Let's see.
[01:27:20.890 --> 01:27:24.110]  Mr. Magoo the cartoon came out in 1960.
[01:27:24.810 --> 01:27:25.490]  That sounds about right.
[01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:31.570]  So, this movie, if you were born the year Mr. Magoo came out, you'd be 37.
[01:27:32.730 --> 01:27:33.170]  Finally.
[01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:36.310]  The thing you've been waiting for.
[01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:40.630]  Holy shit.
[01:27:41.050 --> 01:27:42.650]  Oh my god.
[01:27:42.710 --> 01:27:44.890]  This movie.
[01:27:50.210 --> 01:27:51.570]  He's just stuck in the wind.
[01:27:51.730 --> 01:27:52.370]  That's great.
[01:27:53.570 --> 01:27:54.090]  No!
[01:27:54.630 --> 01:27:55.670]  Turn the camera.
[01:27:58.390 --> 01:28:01.090]  Oh, this movie's dog shit.
[01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.830]  It's so bad.
[01:28:01.850 --> 01:28:04.930]  I've got to know how much it made based on its budget.
[01:28:05.150 --> 01:28:05.890]  Oh, let me look.
[01:28:07.210 --> 01:28:07.930]  IMDB.
[01:28:08.610 --> 01:28:10.350]  Mr. Magoo box office.
[01:28:10.730 --> 01:28:12.890]  I'm seeing it made...
[01:28:14.590 --> 01:28:14.850]  Gross worldwide.
[01:28:14.850 --> 01:28:15.370]  You know what?
[01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:19.750]  21 million dollars on a budget of 30 million.
[01:28:20.290 --> 01:28:23.570]  I'm seeing that it made 28.9 on 30.
[01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:26.150]  Which means it probably broke even.
[01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:26.930]  So it still lost...
[01:28:26.930 --> 01:28:27.890]  No, with marketing?
[01:28:28.590 --> 01:28:30.710]  This thing lost money.
[01:28:30.710 --> 01:28:31.270]  Yeah.
[01:28:32.670 --> 01:28:36.350]  You don't think Mr. Magoo is flying off the shelf on home video?
[01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:38.710]  I just love all the effort.
[01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:45.950]  God, if this movie would have been more cost effective to never have even had a single meeting about it.
[01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:48.290]  And that Disney believed in it.
[01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:50.670]  That this is a Disney movie of all things.
[01:28:51.630 --> 01:28:54.330]  The idea that there could have been a Mr. Magoo park.
[01:28:56.910 --> 01:28:58.630]  Love a bit of Malcolm McDowell.
[01:28:58.630 --> 01:29:00.950]  Oh, he's great in everything he's in.
[01:29:01.810 --> 01:29:04.630]  It feels weird. I'm assuming this isn't like the...
[01:29:05.210 --> 01:29:06.350]  Naked gun people.
[01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:10.010]  It feels like it's trying to copy that in a kid's way.
[01:29:10.930 --> 01:29:12.590]  Yeah, it's not really...
[01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:16.570]  It's not got the same intelligence as a naked gun.
[01:29:17.470 --> 01:29:18.770]  Or the joke volume.
[01:29:19.170 --> 01:29:19.370]  Yeah.
[01:29:19.450 --> 01:29:20.930]  Like the fountain thing is...
[01:29:20.930 --> 01:29:21.510]  The JPM.
[01:29:22.090 --> 01:29:24.450]  Yeah, the jokes per minute on those is ridiculous.
[01:29:25.690 --> 01:29:27.350]  There's so many that like...
[01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:28.970]  It doesn't matter if three of them fail.
[01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:32.230]  Because you're gonna get six more by the time you process what just happened.
[01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:34.050]  Well, that's Mr. Magoo.
[01:29:34.230 --> 01:29:35.750]  We got a definitive answer.
[01:29:35.930 --> 01:29:37.190]  Which I was not expecting.
[01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:38.710]  Within probably the first minute.
[01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:41.790]  Thank you for joining us in this weird sort of watch along.
[01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:44.190]  I didn't expect us to watch this much of this movie.
[01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:46.430]  Yeah, we watched almost a third of it.
[01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:49.190]  Yeah, well it's less than 90 minutes long.
[01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:52.510]  So it's not hard to watch a third of this movie.
[01:29:53.530 --> 01:29:53.990]  Croquet.
[01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.850]  Oh, maybe.
[01:29:55.130 --> 01:29:56.970]  I gotta look into that Let's Play thing again for that.
[01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:57.750]  But anyway.
[01:29:58.370 --> 01:30:00.330]  Thank you so much for watching this weird thing.
[01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:01.430]  Bye.
[01:30:01.610 --> 01:30:01.770]  Bye.
