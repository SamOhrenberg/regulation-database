[00:10.380 --> 00:13.020]  I have some bad news for them, if they're co-workers.
[00:13.900 --> 00:17.880]  I don't know if they know, but the company is closing.
[00:19.120 --> 00:20.280]  It's shutting down.
[00:21.120 --> 00:23.940]  Yeah, I do. I'm still sick.
[00:24.380 --> 00:25.680]  You sound more sick.
[00:26.220 --> 00:30.060]  I think I got laryngitis post from all the coughing.
[00:30.340 --> 00:33.260]  So like, I don't feel bad, but my throat, it doesn't work.
[00:33.760 --> 00:35.720]  Oh, my God. And we're doing two today.
[00:36.180 --> 00:37.580]  Yeah, we're doing a double.
[00:37.580 --> 00:41.420]  Whoa, let's do this.
[00:41.860 --> 00:44.800]  I feel I was told to scream last time.
[00:45.140 --> 00:46.320]  Go ahead. Sorry.
[00:47.860 --> 00:49.840]  We're just deteriorating physically.
[00:51.420 --> 00:52.860]  Don't just stop it physically.
[00:53.040 --> 00:54.800]  Some of us are deteriorating mentally as well.
[00:56.080 --> 00:59.900]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:00.180 --> 01:01.000]  Hell yeah!
[01:01.760 --> 01:02.980]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[01:03.040 --> 01:04.760]  With me, as always, Andrew Pitt and Gavin Free.
[01:04.760 --> 01:08.720]  This is episode 201, our 200th episode.
[01:08.880 --> 01:12.240]  Hard to believe we made it 201, 200 episodes.
[01:12.280 --> 01:15.700]  You know, some people said we wouldn't make 250 and they were right.
[01:17.680 --> 01:18.280]  Good job.
[01:18.540 --> 01:18.760]  I love you.
[01:19.020 --> 01:21.460]  Again, up all the Let's Plays and the drafts.
[01:21.460 --> 01:22.080]  No, that's true.
[01:22.420 --> 01:23.300]  Maybe we're there.
[01:23.740 --> 01:24.560]  That's a very good point.
[01:25.060 --> 01:25.760]  I can't argue that.
[01:26.020 --> 01:27.540]  Please don't argue anything with that voice.
[01:27.860 --> 01:29.420]  Well, I'm going to be doing a lot of talking.
[01:29.700 --> 01:30.100]  Unfortunately.
[01:30.520 --> 01:33.680]  Maybe we could just have you do pickups later and we'll remaster
[01:33.680 --> 01:34.860]  this episode down the line.
[01:36.140 --> 01:37.500]  Like Nick used to do.
[01:37.660 --> 01:38.620]  The cheeky bastard.
[01:40.420 --> 01:45.100]  Speaking of re-dubbing,
[01:46.020 --> 01:48.400]  that reminds me of I don't remember where we were.
[01:48.520 --> 01:50.080]  I think Eric and I maybe had this idea.
[01:50.680 --> 01:52.680]  But if I'm stealing it from somebody else, please let me know.
[01:53.080 --> 01:55.900]  What we should do if we if we move on to the new thing
[01:55.900 --> 01:58.420]  and we can't take the old thing with us, we should
[01:59.480 --> 02:02.220]  we should Taylor Swift it and just re-record
[02:02.220 --> 02:04.520]  like remaster all the old podcasts.
[02:05.540 --> 02:06.520]  Kind of do a fluke face.
[02:06.680 --> 02:07.720]  Oh, that's a great idea.
[02:08.260 --> 02:08.960]  That would be quick.
[02:12.700 --> 02:13.600]  Well, we could do it.
[02:13.660 --> 02:16.100]  We could do ourselves a favor by making the last couple shorter.
[02:17.460 --> 02:19.100]  We'll really appreciate it.
[02:19.560 --> 02:21.920]  Something about remaking stuff sucks.
[02:22.760 --> 02:23.340]  Oh, dude.
[02:23.380 --> 02:25.940]  What's the thing you remade that you hated the most remaking?
[02:26.560 --> 02:29.600]  Um, well, I helped remake some of Red vs.
[02:29.600 --> 02:30.420]  Blue at HD.
[02:31.200 --> 02:34.940]  Yeah. And trying to get some of the stuff to happen the exact same way
[02:34.940 --> 02:37.880]  it happened originally, like trying to get the warthog to bounce off
[02:37.880 --> 02:39.180]  the rock in the exact same way.
[02:39.680 --> 02:40.140]  Good Lord.
[02:40.720 --> 02:44.680]  That was one of the least satisfying things I've been a part of
[02:44.680 --> 02:45.940]  was remastered Red vs.
[02:46.040 --> 02:47.640]  Blue. That really sucked.
[02:47.760 --> 02:48.940]  It was hard enough the first time.
[02:49.320 --> 02:53.220]  The extra slap in the face is that we only remastered it to like 1080i
[02:54.840 --> 02:56.880]  and it probably could be done again
[02:58.020 --> 02:58.900]  in 4K.
[03:00.180 --> 03:03.200]  Well, maybe George Lucas will buy the rights to RVB
[03:03.200 --> 03:06.960]  and then he can remaster it till his heart's content all day, all night long.
[03:08.100 --> 03:08.980]  Oh, man.
[03:09.960 --> 03:12.160]  Andrew, do you ever remaster anything?
[03:12.920 --> 03:13.740]  I guess you did Fluke Face.
[03:13.800 --> 03:16.620]  I did Fluke Face, but that was fun because I never listened to it.
[03:16.660 --> 03:19.680]  So that was like the first time I got to listen to the first episode.
[03:19.820 --> 03:21.120]  That was enjoyable.
[03:21.700 --> 03:23.280]  Have you listened to an episode since?
[03:24.480 --> 03:26.680]  No, I've never listened to an episode.
[03:26.680 --> 03:31.240]  If you have an absolute banger line in an episode like last last week's
[03:31.240 --> 03:34.680]  Alabama Poutine, you don't you don't like go back and just listen to that bit.
[03:34.920 --> 03:36.660]  No. Why would I do that?
[03:36.920 --> 03:39.000]  Because you were like you got a huge laugh.
[03:39.340 --> 03:41.560]  Yeah, but it feels masturbatory to do that.
[03:41.880 --> 03:44.000]  You don't have to like touch your penis while you listen to it.
[03:44.060 --> 03:44.420]  You can just listen to it.
[03:44.420 --> 03:48.180]  But it's it's like ego masturbation is what it's like.
[03:48.220 --> 03:49.640]  Hey, look at this.
[03:49.700 --> 03:51.320]  Like how funny I was in this moment.
[03:51.440 --> 03:55.700]  Also, I'd like to think that happens more often than not in this context.
[03:56.180 --> 03:59.580]  It feels like weirdly insulting to feel the need to parade
[03:59.580 --> 04:01.480]  a funny line on a comedy podcast.
[04:02.900 --> 04:05.640]  I've got to say, Gav, I'm kind of with Andrew on this one.
[04:05.740 --> 04:07.340]  It feels pretty masturbatory.
[04:07.480 --> 04:08.920]  It's like you're jacking off your ego.
[04:09.500 --> 04:12.440]  I guess it's different for me because I actually proof each one.
[04:13.060 --> 04:14.240]  Yeah. So I hear them all.
[04:14.340 --> 04:16.560]  But yeah, I mean, I can see both.
[04:16.960 --> 04:20.020]  I think it also I think Geoff and I maybe we have
[04:20.020 --> 04:22.940]  we're coming from a low place of self-esteem, but not the bottom.
[04:22.940 --> 04:25.420]  Like we have a floor at least.
[04:25.700 --> 04:29.560]  I can see if you have no floor, just be like, hey, I was funny once.
[04:30.500 --> 04:32.720]  Look, I'm capable of doing this.
[04:33.140 --> 04:34.540]  That's that's the other part.
[04:34.640 --> 04:38.880]  It's like if I if like the Alabama poutine line is a fucking classic
[04:38.880 --> 04:41.820]  instant classic, if I had said that
[04:42.780 --> 04:47.540]  or something that I thought was as funny as that, you know, like a go go now.
[04:47.760 --> 04:50.720]  If I went back and I thought, oh, I'm pretty happy with that line,
[04:50.740 --> 04:52.740]  I'm pretty proud of myself for coming up with Alabama poutine.
[04:52.940 --> 04:55.220]  And then if I were to go back and listen to it, I would go,
[04:55.520 --> 04:58.220]  well, that's only about 80 percent as funny as I thought it was.
[04:58.440 --> 04:59.360]  Let me listen to it again.
[04:59.460 --> 05:02.920]  And by the time I was done, it would be the I would have convinced myself
[05:02.920 --> 05:04.680]  it was the dumbest thing I'd ever said.
[05:04.780 --> 05:07.220]  And I should ask to have it retroactively removed.
[05:07.500 --> 05:12.040]  I would go from thinking I hit a home run to fucking three straight strikes
[05:12.040 --> 05:13.800]  in 13 seconds in my brain.
[05:13.920 --> 05:16.140]  You just you can't I couldn't couldn't.
[05:16.400 --> 05:17.760]  That's why I can't listen to the podcast.
[05:18.320 --> 05:20.920]  Yeah, you would you would butcher this thing.
[05:22.320 --> 05:23.460]  You would butcher yourself.
[05:23.560 --> 05:24.960]  You would cut yourself completely out of these.
[05:25.740 --> 05:28.420]  I would. Dude, there have been there have been episodes where I went to Nick
[05:28.420 --> 05:30.100]  and I'm like, just take out everything I said.
[05:30.380 --> 05:33.800]  Yeah, I remember the moment where I was like, maybe I could work at Rooster Teeth.
[05:34.040 --> 05:36.800]  Maybe I could be there and like be funny,
[05:37.580 --> 05:40.500]  because on the Rooster Teeth podcast once,
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.940]  Jack made a joke that I made in a tweet
[05:43.940 --> 05:46.500]  and it made everyone on the podcast laugh.
[05:47.100 --> 05:49.860]  And I don't know if he just saw my tweet and recited it
[05:49.860 --> 05:52.000]  or whether he also came up with the same thing.
[05:52.340 --> 05:55.780]  But I was like, oh, maybe I could make maybe I could make them laugh.
[05:55.920 --> 05:57.280]  Maybe I should go there and be on that.
[05:57.760 --> 06:00.060]  And that was like a that was like a real moment for you.
[06:00.560 --> 06:01.920]  Yeah. What was the joke?
[06:02.160 --> 06:04.060]  Oh, it was about that movie 2012.
[06:04.280 --> 06:06.740]  I tweeted something like they should have called that movie.
[06:06.800 --> 06:10.260]  I'm glad I'm not where I was eight seconds ago or something like that.
[06:10.620 --> 06:13.340]  And it just made everyone on the podcast laugh.
[06:13.360 --> 06:14.260]  And I thought that was my joke.
[06:14.540 --> 06:15.300]  It's not a very good joke.
[06:15.780 --> 06:17.860]  Yeah, but he still stole it from you. Yeah.
[06:18.000 --> 06:19.100]  Oh, I don't know if he stole that ever.
[06:19.100 --> 06:22.100]  I think deep down, I think you I think you think you did.
[06:22.180 --> 06:24.440]  No, I know, Jack. I'm pretty sure he probably stole it.
[06:26.440 --> 06:29.280]  I should have to I should have to 15 years just ask him.
[06:29.440 --> 06:30.140]  There's no way anyone.
[06:30.580 --> 06:33.380]  You can't really it after this time.
[06:33.440 --> 06:36.220]  You can't really challenge people at it because no one remembers anything they've said.
[06:36.660 --> 06:41.100]  Yeah. That's like how there's tapes to fucking play it for him to go like,
[06:41.160 --> 06:42.620]  all right, in this moment, what do you think?
[06:43.400 --> 06:46.080]  Do you think are you being very funny right now?
[06:46.120 --> 06:46.960]  Are you being a thief?
[06:46.960 --> 06:48.080]  Maybe I should.
[06:48.360 --> 06:50.760]  Maybe I should record a bit with him and just play him the clip.
[06:50.820 --> 06:51.780]  That would be awesome.
[06:52.980 --> 06:53.880]  Where'd you get that from?
[06:54.300 --> 06:56.920]  Dude, if you could lay that out for him and go, all right,
[06:56.920 --> 07:00.840]  we recorded this on September 3rd, 2008 or whatever.
[07:01.080 --> 07:03.820]  And then and then you tweet.
[07:03.960 --> 07:06.480]  I tweeted on September 1st.
[07:07.260 --> 07:09.640]  You were I verified you were following me.
[07:10.220 --> 07:12.020]  We had to look at the likes on the tweet.
[07:12.460 --> 07:14.560]  Maybe you liked it on the second.
[07:14.720 --> 07:15.500]  You son of a bitch.
[07:16.960 --> 07:18.840]  Oh, man. That's very funny.
[07:18.940 --> 07:21.320]  You had that that experience. I had the opposite.
[07:22.060 --> 07:24.480]  I had a thought where I thought, oh, I'd be good on a podcast.
[07:24.560 --> 07:27.500]  And then I had I realized, no, I'm not funny.
[07:27.880 --> 07:30.320]  Like, I can't I wouldn't. What would I say?
[07:30.580 --> 07:35.160]  Like, I then imagine myself on a podcast and at that time
[07:35.160 --> 07:38.300]  and felt like, what are you what what are you talking about?
[07:38.780 --> 07:43.000]  Nobody. No, you're not qualified for this position in the slightest.
[07:44.060 --> 07:45.700]  I never had the reverse of that.
[07:45.700 --> 07:49.780]  Yeah, I feel like that's how I felt up up to the moment where Jack
[07:49.780 --> 07:52.060]  tested out some of my material and it played well.
[07:53.480 --> 07:58.880]  You at the very least could be a joke writer, a ghost joke writer for Jack
[07:58.880 --> 08:01.280]  or give me Jack's ghostwriter.
[08:01.380 --> 08:04.760]  I love it. Oh, my God.
[08:04.920 --> 08:08.860]  Hey, I sent you guys a video last night that that was pretty fucking funny.
[08:09.140 --> 08:10.640]  Oh, my God. Yeah. What was that about?
[08:11.120 --> 08:12.180]  What is that word?
[08:12.180 --> 08:16.960]  I was watching the Bucks and the Lakers play last night.
[08:17.060 --> 08:19.460]  They were in double overtime.
[08:19.720 --> 08:22.140]  It was an awesome game. Anthony Davis was.
[08:23.320 --> 08:26.120]  Anthony Davis, if he hadn't already done it, he made his case
[08:26.120 --> 08:29.920]  for defensive player of the year in just in the last 10 minutes of that game.
[08:30.460 --> 08:31.580]  Just insane defense.
[08:32.280 --> 08:33.240]  Very entertaining.
[08:33.240 --> 08:35.840]  And it was fun to watch Lillard and Giannis with.
[08:36.360 --> 08:37.500]  I got to be honest.
[08:38.160 --> 08:43.100]  But at one point, I think Austin Reeves is driving to to the basket
[08:43.100 --> 08:44.980]  like Anthony Davis kicks the ball back.
[08:45.300 --> 08:46.700]  And I think Reeves is driving in.
[08:46.780 --> 08:48.380]  It might not be reason. I'm not sure who it was.
[08:48.800 --> 08:53.340]  But the announcer says that he's jizzles to the lane.
[08:55.000 --> 08:56.940]  And I thought, did you hear that, Emily?
[08:57.000 --> 08:57.640]  And she's like, hear what?
[08:57.700 --> 08:59.860]  And I was like, I'm sure I heard him say jizzles.
[08:59.900 --> 09:00.500]  Is that a word?
[09:00.540 --> 09:02.520]  And she's like, I definitely didn't say jizzles.
[09:02.780 --> 09:04.880]  And so I rewound it and played it again.
[09:04.880 --> 09:07.220]  And the motherfucker says jizzles.
[09:07.780 --> 09:11.640]  And clearly he's trying to say juke and dribble at the same time.
[09:12.300 --> 09:13.580]  That was Andrew's analysis.
[09:13.980 --> 09:15.260]  But it comes out jizzle.
[09:15.600 --> 09:16.420]  And so I recorded it.
[09:16.500 --> 09:18.260]  I sent it to you guys last night.
[09:18.820 --> 09:20.100]  I think you could have put it up on Instagram.
[09:20.340 --> 09:22.140]  It's the funniest fucking thing.
[09:22.360 --> 09:25.120]  Why does it immediately sound like it's the name of a monkey to me?
[09:25.740 --> 09:26.560]  Jizzles the monkey?
[09:26.840 --> 09:28.420]  Yeah, it's a great monkey name.
[09:28.440 --> 09:29.040]  And I don't know why.
[09:29.560 --> 09:32.340]  Well, Andrew, I think it was Andrew last night,
[09:33.020 --> 09:35.540]  googled it and found in the wiktionary
[09:36.720 --> 09:40.860]  that jizzle is, I guess, a euphemism for prison bitch.
[09:43.060 --> 09:44.840]  So he prison bitched.
[09:44.880 --> 09:46.380]  I don't think that was what he was going for.
[09:46.740 --> 09:48.100]  It clearly must have been.
[09:48.960 --> 09:50.180]  I was excited for a second.
[09:50.260 --> 09:51.680]  I was like, oh, he just came up with a new word.
[09:51.760 --> 09:54.560]  I'm going to say all the time everything's going to be jizzle now. Right.
[09:55.160 --> 09:57.440]  And but then I found out that it means prison bitch.
[09:57.500 --> 10:00.840]  And that feels weird to walk around just going prison bitch, prison bitch.
[10:01.320 --> 10:04.660]  So the thing I was at dinner, so I didn't get a reply.
[10:04.980 --> 10:07.980]  But the thing I remember it from jizzle was a thing from whitest kids,
[10:08.080 --> 10:09.320]  you know, that sketch comedy group.
[10:09.440 --> 10:10.480]  And they just did.
[10:10.580 --> 10:12.000]  Why do you sound like shit as well?
[10:12.300 --> 10:13.620]  I've been I was sick.
[10:13.880 --> 10:15.860]  Oh, man. Is that you and Andrew been making out?
[10:16.140 --> 10:17.260]  Yeah. Is that OK?
[10:18.040 --> 10:19.200]  I'm just fine with me.
[10:19.240 --> 10:20.960]  I just realized I heard you speak here.
[10:21.560 --> 10:22.860]  Yeah, well, I hadn't talked.
[10:22.940 --> 10:23.700]  You weren't here for pleasantries.
[10:23.800 --> 10:24.960]  They were sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[10:25.040 --> 10:27.400]  You're sick. Hey, thank you so much.
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.340]  The jizzle was a whitest kids, you know, skit from forever ago.
[10:32.640 --> 10:36.640]  It was just a guy doing an infomercial where he's just selling a cum rag.
[10:37.020 --> 10:37.840]  Like, that's all it.
[10:38.040 --> 10:41.200]  So the whole time I'm at dinner, my phone was just going off
[10:41.200 --> 10:43.200]  and then it was well beyond the conversation.
[10:43.360 --> 10:45.180]  I went, oh, man, jizzle.
[10:46.500 --> 10:49.480]  So you thought it was too late to chime in with jizzle knowledge?
[10:49.720 --> 10:52.760]  Yeah, yeah. I was like I was going to hit you guys with it.
[10:52.760 --> 10:53.920]  But I went, it's too late.
[10:54.000 --> 10:54.860]  The jizzle's gone.
[10:54.860 --> 10:58.440]  Like there's no point in sending the jizzle at this point.
[10:58.580 --> 11:01.200]  I feel like if you've got such custom jizzle knowledge,
[11:01.300 --> 11:02.540]  you have to bring it back around.
[11:02.560 --> 11:05.380]  I'm sorry, but that's I mean, I figured, you know, here it is.
[11:05.480 --> 11:08.300]  But there's like it's like a whole sketch called the jizzle.
[11:08.840 --> 11:10.560]  So that's insane.
[11:10.820 --> 11:13.700]  Do you think that's what Kevin Harlan or whoever the final thing was Harlan?
[11:13.760 --> 11:14.960]  But whoever the fuck it was announcing.
[11:15.060 --> 11:16.120]  Do you think that's what they were referencing?
[11:16.320 --> 11:19.920]  Yeah. Yeah. He was thinking about the whitest kids, you know, sketch.
[11:22.620 --> 11:25.620]  He's been waiting to get the jizzle in there for a long time.
[11:25.800 --> 11:28.500]  I also love to because the other announcer, I think it was Reggie Miller,
[11:29.920 --> 11:31.200]  didn't say anything at all.
[11:31.280 --> 11:34.980]  There wasn't like an awkward like silence or like a or anything.
[11:35.060 --> 11:39.180]  Just like they just steamrolled on as if as if nothing weird had happened
[11:39.180 --> 11:41.940]  with a fucking major
[11:42.480 --> 11:47.620]  on a nationally broadcast television show where an announcer says jizz.
[11:48.140 --> 11:49.760]  Can I can I ask?
[11:50.740 --> 11:54.260]  Are we in like a calm era for this podcast?
[11:54.620 --> 11:58.280]  I mean, it's two in a row and I figured maybe it was just because Gracie wasn't here.
[11:58.620 --> 12:00.620]  Well, first off, that's what I'm saying.
[12:00.620 --> 12:02.040]  I'm making sure I'm checking.
[12:02.660 --> 12:07.060]  If we're in a calm era, it wouldn't be our it'd be like we don't control TNT.
[12:07.480 --> 12:10.140]  We don't control the National Basketball Association.
[12:10.440 --> 12:12.060]  First of all, we don't control the NBA.
[12:12.500 --> 12:15.560]  Second of all, you're the one that brought it to come.
[12:15.560 --> 12:17.420]  No, you just brought it to come.
[12:17.460 --> 12:19.120]  And then you asked if we were going to come here.
[12:19.300 --> 12:20.700]  We're not. That's absolutely true.
[12:20.900 --> 12:22.720]  We were talking about that.
[12:23.100 --> 12:25.440]  The whole thing, the whole thing is come adjacent.
[12:25.780 --> 12:27.780]  And then after last week's episode, right.
[12:27.900 --> 12:29.960]  And after last week, it was last.
[12:30.320 --> 12:31.040]  No, no, you brought up.
[12:31.080 --> 12:32.080]  No, you brought up jizzle.
[12:32.220 --> 12:35.040]  And you know what the fuck you're doing when you're dancing around it.
[12:35.080 --> 12:36.260]  You know exactly what you're doing.
[12:36.360 --> 12:37.860]  You know exactly what this is.
[12:37.940 --> 12:39.840]  Listen, there's some subtlety to this.
[12:39.920 --> 12:43.160]  If we were dancing around it, you drove a fucking steamroller.
[12:43.380 --> 12:45.060]  Right. And so that's why I'm asking
[12:45.060 --> 12:47.320]  if that's what we're in, because you're all right.
[12:47.340 --> 12:50.620]  If we're in it, if we're in it, it's all because of you.
[12:50.860 --> 12:53.100]  Because of talking about what happened on last week's episode.
[12:53.380 --> 12:55.260]  That's I'm seeing if that's what we're in.
[12:55.280 --> 12:56.100]  If that's how we're ending.
[12:56.380 --> 13:00.620]  You just slam the come flag into the ground and then ask, does this belong?
[13:00.740 --> 13:02.440]  And then asked if this is how we're ending.
[13:02.540 --> 13:04.320]  Yeah, this is how we're all going to finish, Eric.
[13:05.380 --> 13:09.520]  Stay tuned for the face come flag coming to the store soon.
[13:09.880 --> 13:11.040]  That's going to be the end of it.
[13:13.720 --> 13:17.800]  So Gracie, would you like to be the first person to veto an era?
[13:19.100 --> 13:22.520]  Yes. You think we should love to consider it done?
[13:23.060 --> 13:25.100]  There we go. Right out of your camera.
[13:25.580 --> 13:27.600]  Put put a stop to Eric real.
[13:27.660 --> 13:29.740]  I don't like the implication we were ever in one.
[13:29.900 --> 13:31.740]  I'd rather just never occurred.
[13:32.060 --> 13:33.180]  I'm right there with you.
[13:33.300 --> 13:36.660]  I got to be honest, that thing that Eric brought up never entered.
[13:36.720 --> 13:37.680]  I don't I will.
[13:37.780 --> 13:40.080]  I will say it wasn't an implication and it was a declaration.
[13:40.080 --> 13:43.520]  I and I think we were firmly in it after last week, 100 percent,
[13:43.700 --> 13:45.240]  because it continued into two episodes.
[13:45.640 --> 13:46.640]  It's it's too much.
[13:46.720 --> 13:48.300]  I'm you. That's why I asked.
[13:48.420 --> 13:51.500]  I have to do this because you did that because we're doing two today.
[13:51.500 --> 13:55.100]  So if like the next one also had come talk, then it's like it's too much.
[13:55.380 --> 13:56.580]  And I was trying to get ahead of it.
[13:57.120 --> 14:02.060]  I was more trying to angle it towards if you're not watching NBA games,
[14:02.080 --> 14:06.120]  you really should be because they are sexing up the NBA.
[14:06.360 --> 14:10.060]  If you'll remember a month ago, I sent you guys a video
[14:10.060 --> 14:13.780]  of a lady popping her boob out on national television
[14:13.780 --> 14:17.420]  while she was breastfeeding a baby, and it was right there on the screen,
[14:17.500 --> 14:18.380]  right next to the ref.
[14:18.620 --> 14:20.280]  And then here we are a month later.
[14:20.560 --> 14:23.120]  NBA announcers throwing around jizzle.
[14:23.300 --> 14:24.940]  I'm just saying, tune in.
[14:25.360 --> 14:26.540]  Who knows what's going to happen next?
[14:26.740 --> 14:31.500]  Come talk sounds like our Clutch Pearls Pod supplemental content is what it is.
[14:31.900 --> 14:33.200]  That's our adjacent
[14:35.480 --> 14:37.760]  come talk, come talk.
[14:37.760 --> 14:39.900]  I have. But it's spelled C-O-M-E.
[14:40.080 --> 14:42.020]  It's a very clean show. It's about coming and talking.
[14:42.020 --> 14:44.140]  It's like, hey, come on over and talk to us about stuff.
[14:45.060 --> 14:46.200]  Do you like poutine?
[14:46.740 --> 14:47.500]  Andrew's Canadian.
[14:48.020 --> 14:50.320]  I am. You're from Alabama.
[14:50.860 --> 14:51.680]  Those are just facts.
[14:52.280 --> 14:53.140]  Those are just facts.
[14:53.620 --> 14:54.360]  Alabama, Canada.
[14:54.760 --> 14:55.760]  It's just information.
[14:56.380 --> 14:58.560]  I apparently had a life hack.
[14:58.640 --> 15:02.000]  Oh, the comments have let me know something.
[15:04.560 --> 15:06.920]  This is my life hack, which I
[15:07.480 --> 15:09.400]  do remember now, but I have since forgotten.
[15:10.060 --> 15:13.700]  I used to keep a nine volt battery on the doorframe
[15:13.700 --> 15:16.600]  next to every smoke detector in my house.
[15:17.180 --> 15:18.520]  That's a life hack.
[15:18.660 --> 15:22.840]  So that whenever my damn thing beeped, the battery was right there.
[15:23.540 --> 15:25.900]  No matter what time, always three in the morning,
[15:25.900 --> 15:27.980]  I could just get up there and immediately change it.
[15:28.520 --> 15:30.760]  Wow. And I guess I moved.
[15:31.380 --> 15:33.920]  I moved house and left all my nine volts up there.
[15:33.960 --> 15:35.480]  And I never remember that I did that.
[15:35.480 --> 15:38.600]  I never put nine volts all over my doorframes again.
[15:39.340 --> 15:43.860]  Do you think the new people that moved in understood what that was?
[15:43.960 --> 15:46.360]  Or do you think for years they've been telling people going,
[15:46.500 --> 15:47.560]  I just don't understand it.
[15:47.840 --> 15:49.880]  It was a nine volt above every door jam in the house.
[15:49.960 --> 15:51.300]  It's the strangest goddamn thing.
[15:52.020 --> 15:54.200]  Yeah, I bet they just threw them all away. Yeah.
[15:54.600 --> 15:56.000]  Oh, man, this door's creaky.
[15:56.080 --> 15:57.960]  We got to swap the battery on it.
[15:58.060 --> 16:00.060]  We got to get a new nine volt in there.
[16:00.720 --> 16:03.520]  Why didn't they tell us these doors are battery operated?
[16:03.520 --> 16:06.480]  They just completely misunderstood purpose.
[16:06.680 --> 16:10.140]  I mean, with my fingerprint door handles, all my doors are battery operated.
[16:12.700 --> 16:13.980]  Got to keep the cats out.
[16:14.700 --> 16:15.960]  Got to keep the cats out.
[16:16.760 --> 16:20.180]  Hey, speaking of cats, I just I noticed something about my dog,
[16:20.200 --> 16:23.420]  and it got me wondering about Eric's dog and y'all's cats.
[16:23.980 --> 16:27.420]  Do you think your cat is or dog are left or right handed?
[16:29.720 --> 16:32.520]  My cat is 23 years old.
[16:32.520 --> 16:34.520]  I don't think it has any awareness.
[16:35.040 --> 16:36.860]  I it's eternal. It won't die.
[16:36.960 --> 16:38.700]  It's it's immune to all things.
[16:38.780 --> 16:42.100]  It's going to that's an insane amount of time for a cat to be like it is.
[16:42.200 --> 16:44.060]  Yeah, I got my cat when I was six.
[16:44.220 --> 16:45.460]  She's still walking around.
[16:45.800 --> 16:48.060]  Barely. You guys are headed for the record books.
[16:48.500 --> 16:50.560]  We are. I yeah, I don't think she has a preference.
[16:51.060 --> 16:54.080]  Gracie, do you have any idea whether my dog is right or left?
[16:54.160 --> 16:55.720]  Cinnamon is right or left handed.
[16:56.040 --> 16:59.180]  You know, I hate to break it to you, but I don't think she's either
[16:59.180 --> 17:01.300]  because she can't even stand on her own four legs very well.
[17:03.180 --> 17:05.720]  But in a perfect world, I would say left.
[17:06.180 --> 17:07.580]  How old? How old?
[17:07.680 --> 17:08.640]  She's 16 and a half.
[17:08.840 --> 17:10.280]  Whoa. Whoa. Yeah.
[17:10.760 --> 17:15.160]  Oh, I have noticed recently, and I don't think I've ever noticed this
[17:15.160 --> 17:19.160]  with any of my other animals, but Albert is definitely left pawed.
[17:19.780 --> 17:23.320]  Right. He he he does everything with his left paw.
[17:24.360 --> 17:27.600]  And when he wants to show affection, that's the paw he raises
[17:27.600 --> 17:29.580]  when he wants to move something or play with a toy.
[17:29.640 --> 17:30.660]  That's the paw he uses.
[17:30.660 --> 17:33.960]  And I just realized that that he clearly favors that left paw,
[17:34.060 --> 17:35.500]  which makes me happy because I'm left handed. Right.
[17:35.580 --> 17:38.140]  So it's like genetically runs in the family, obviously.
[17:38.840 --> 17:40.000]  Millie's also left handed.
[17:40.160 --> 17:41.580]  So totally makes sense.
[17:42.160 --> 17:43.960]  But I just it crossed my mind.
[17:44.040 --> 17:46.900]  I never really noticed a pet being one or the other before.
[17:47.080 --> 17:52.260]  And I wonder if he's unique in that way or if I'm, you know, insane.
[17:52.820 --> 17:56.040]  I could find out immediately with my cats, because if I just hold
[17:56.040 --> 17:59.880]  one of my cats near another one, they both raise their slapping paw.
[18:01.320 --> 18:03.060]  As if they're about to get into it.
[18:04.020 --> 18:06.500]  So I just see which one gets in the air.
[18:06.800 --> 18:07.520]  But here's the thing.
[18:07.760 --> 18:10.940]  You don't know if your cat is a self paw or not, though.
[18:11.080 --> 18:13.860]  They might the dominant hand might not necessarily be at the front
[18:13.860 --> 18:14.820]  or what is considered dominant.
[18:14.840 --> 18:18.000]  I don't think you'd throw a first punch with your off hand, though, would you?
[18:18.100 --> 18:18.840]  Never, never.
[18:19.600 --> 18:22.080]  Well, just, you know, you could depend on your comfort of your stance.
[18:23.060 --> 18:27.940]  But for a dog or a cat, could does it have to be limited to front paws?
[18:28.540 --> 18:30.640]  Could they be like back right pawed?
[18:31.100 --> 18:31.680]  You know what I mean?
[18:32.260 --> 18:36.140]  I assume so. Yeah, I think I think all their paws are equal.
[18:36.680 --> 18:37.840]  Yeah. Yeah.
[18:38.660 --> 18:41.960]  Yeah, I mean, that's pretty your dog might be back right pawed,
[18:42.020 --> 18:45.400]  but he's using his front left paw just to get like your attention or whatever.
[18:45.580 --> 18:50.820]  Or maybe my dog is left front pawed, but most dogs are back leg pawed
[18:50.820 --> 18:52.060]  and you're not looking for that.
[18:52.100 --> 18:53.240]  So you just don't notice.
[18:54.200 --> 18:55.860]  Like maybe Albert's the outlier
[18:55.860 --> 18:58.160]  and most dogs favor a back left or right paw.
[18:58.820 --> 19:01.220]  Yeah. And and it's just like who's looking at a dog in that way?
[19:01.280 --> 19:01.960]  You just don't pay attention.
[19:02.260 --> 19:05.180]  So, you know, do you have a dominant foot, Geoff, because you're left handed?
[19:05.480 --> 19:07.420]  Yeah. Like I have my I have a kicking foot.
[19:07.640 --> 19:09.460]  Would you say your kicking foot is your dominant foot?
[19:09.780 --> 19:10.620]  I would think so.
[19:10.700 --> 19:13.160]  That would be the foot that would generate the most power.
[19:13.520 --> 19:15.700]  My right foot would be my planting foot.
[19:16.800 --> 19:18.980]  Then I would maybe argue unless I'm skateboarding,
[19:19.100 --> 19:22.560]  unless I'm skateboarding and then my left foot is on the board.
[19:23.500 --> 19:24.340]  You're ambi footed.
[19:24.340 --> 19:28.760]  So you're saying I guess maybe I am, but I'd rather kick you with my left foot.
[19:28.860 --> 19:30.400]  But is that because you like the left?
[19:30.540 --> 19:33.200]  I can kick you with my I could definitely kick you with my right foot.
[19:33.460 --> 19:35.620]  But I think it'd be better if I could kick you with my left.
[19:35.960 --> 19:38.180]  But a kick is all about generating force.
[19:38.320 --> 19:41.160]  I feel like maybe your right foot is the like the dominant one
[19:41.160 --> 19:43.260]  that you're driving power off of in that scenario.
[19:44.560 --> 19:47.560]  Like, I don't know if because you kick left, that means your left foot
[19:47.560 --> 19:48.520]  is the stronger foot.
[19:48.700 --> 19:50.580]  I think you want a stronger foot to be your base.
[19:51.780 --> 19:54.640]  I would. Where does the kick come from?
[19:54.740 --> 19:57.100]  Is it? It's your hip. Is it your lap?
[19:57.500 --> 19:59.260]  Is your hip? Which muscle does it?
[19:59.620 --> 20:01.280]  Yeah, I think it's largely a hip thing.
[20:01.540 --> 20:05.220]  I think it's generating force from your core into the leg.
[20:05.560 --> 20:07.620]  Do you feel a kick in the wiener at all?
[20:08.740 --> 20:10.640]  Oh, like, like a kick starts.
[20:10.800 --> 20:15.360]  And like, do you think you derive any power from your dick power?
[20:15.580 --> 20:18.660]  No. Or maybe I got to go do some kicks.
[20:19.140 --> 20:20.360]  Maybe that's why they wear a cup.
[20:20.360 --> 20:24.180]  And it has to contain the dick power or else would be too much.
[20:25.000 --> 20:26.360]  People begin kicked in half.
[20:26.440 --> 20:29.100]  Otherwise, speaking of kicking, man, you know, I've been watching
[20:29.100 --> 20:31.060]  a lot of UFC the last year or two.
[20:31.060 --> 20:35.220]  Uh-huh. And I don't know why anybody does anything in that sport
[20:35.220 --> 20:36.320]  other than calf kicking.
[20:36.620 --> 20:41.840]  I've never seen a UFC fighter who got kicked in the calf hard win a fight.
[20:42.340 --> 20:45.180]  It's as soon as they get kicked in the calf five times
[20:45.180 --> 20:48.740]  and they have a like a fucking like a little red mark or a bruise.
[20:48.820 --> 20:49.980]  It's over for that person.
[20:50.740 --> 20:53.080]  So I just thought that out there, if you ever wanted to get it,
[20:53.160 --> 20:55.820]  if you ever wanted to get into a like a MMA fight in the street,
[20:55.920 --> 20:56.900]  just kick somebody in the calf.
[20:56.980 --> 20:57.940]  Apparently, that's all you got to do.
[20:58.540 --> 21:02.220]  Have you ever seen John Jones's front knee kicks he does to people?
[21:02.460 --> 21:03.360]  Those are the worst.
[21:03.720 --> 21:05.720]  How that has that should be illegal.
[21:05.840 --> 21:07.100]  How is that not illegal?
[21:07.320 --> 21:08.440]  That's so crazy.
[21:08.820 --> 21:10.680]  There are a lot of fighters that think it should be illegal.
[21:10.920 --> 21:13.620]  He's like the only one that I know that consistently does it.
[21:13.640 --> 21:14.900]  And I think it's because of his frame.
[21:14.980 --> 21:18.460]  But it is that is like the one move that I've seen.
[21:18.460 --> 21:21.200]  Obviously, get absolutely destroyed.
[21:21.320 --> 21:22.180]  You've seen countless ways.
[21:22.540 --> 21:26.740]  But the move that makes me grimace the most is that that fucking front knee kick.
[21:27.220 --> 21:28.820]  Hmm. Terrible.
[21:29.160 --> 21:30.980]  Do you think there should be more gun based sport?
[21:31.320 --> 21:32.740]  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[21:32.740 --> 21:34.300]  Just they're they're going to think about it.
[21:34.360 --> 21:36.720]  I'm saying yes to start like this.
[21:36.800 --> 21:38.020]  This paintball is airsoft.
[21:38.560 --> 21:41.700]  Why don't just armor up and just use real bullets?
[21:42.580 --> 21:43.060]  Hmm.
[21:43.900 --> 21:45.500]  Well, I mean, we do. We have that.
[21:45.620 --> 21:46.300]  It's called war.
[21:46.300 --> 21:48.240]  Well, OK, fun game.
[21:48.420 --> 21:53.980]  Do you know about do you know about dueling pistol, like competitive dueling pistol fights?
[21:54.320 --> 21:57.040]  Like not where you're trying to kill someone.
[21:57.200 --> 21:58.960]  The wax bullet. Do you know about that?
[21:59.020 --> 21:59.860]  That's fucking crazy.
[22:00.980 --> 22:01.580]  Yeah, that's cool.
[22:03.120 --> 22:04.460]  Like, bring that back.
[22:04.660 --> 22:08.680]  Do you guys know about this where it's just it's dueling pistols and instead of real bullets,
[22:08.680 --> 22:13.460]  they shoot wax at each other and it hurts like a paintball, but it's just wax.
[22:13.880 --> 22:15.060]  No, it's like that.
[22:15.060 --> 22:17.880]  So as like a duel, it's a dueling pistol sport.
[22:18.160 --> 22:21.260]  It's really but like, you know, it was like in 1909 or whatever.
[22:21.400 --> 22:22.280]  It's not like a real thing anymore.
[22:23.000 --> 22:27.500]  Do you think, Gav, that it's not as popular because one team dies?
[22:28.800 --> 22:30.920]  I don't think there has to be a death.
[22:31.260 --> 22:33.060]  I mean, just like glancing blows.
[22:33.380 --> 22:36.180]  Yeah, if you're just Kevlar'd and steel plated to oblivion.
[22:36.640 --> 22:39.860]  Oh, like Johnny Knoxville in the early, early days.
[22:42.180 --> 22:43.860]  I don't think this should be a thing.
[22:43.860 --> 22:45.260]  Yeah, I know I'm just joking.
[22:46.320 --> 22:50.280]  I think Alec Baldwin really took the wind out of the gun sport sales.
[22:50.520 --> 22:53.180]  I think it's a tough... Jesus Christ.
[22:54.040 --> 22:55.300]  Well, that's what I'm thinking of.
[22:55.420 --> 22:58.760]  Like, that's a scenario in which a fake gun is being used,
[22:58.840 --> 23:00.860]  not firing anything, and it caused a death.
[23:01.040 --> 23:01.640]  Was it a fake gun?
[23:02.140 --> 23:03.920]  No, I thought that was a real gun.
[23:04.120 --> 23:05.420]  I think it was a real gun, but it was supposed to have blanks.
[23:06.340 --> 23:07.320]  Whatever it was.
[23:07.380 --> 23:12.000]  It was a scenario in which there should not be any actual ammunition used.
[23:12.200 --> 23:13.400]  And you're talking about a scenario.
[23:13.400 --> 23:15.060]  Yeah. And which ammunition would be.
[23:15.860 --> 23:19.900]  But there are then situations, too, where like Brandon Lee died from a blank.
[23:20.440 --> 23:21.280]  Yeah, I don't know.
[23:21.500 --> 23:22.500]  In a really stupid way.
[23:22.580 --> 23:25.220]  But, you know, I mean, there are tons of movies that use live ammo.
[23:25.360 --> 23:28.500]  You just have to do it safe if they just have no one around.
[23:29.180 --> 23:30.240]  Remote cameras and all that.
[23:30.600 --> 23:34.960]  Can I point out at this part of the podcast that I fucking hate guns.
[23:35.500 --> 23:36.600]  You've had nothing.
[23:36.760 --> 23:37.780]  I just want the world to know.
[23:37.840 --> 23:39.920]  I just want to I just I feel I can't put that out there enough.
[23:39.980 --> 23:40.960]  I do not like guns.
[23:41.140 --> 23:41.960]  They just gross me out.
[23:41.960 --> 23:42.840]  Five years of the army.
[23:43.240 --> 23:48.680]  And then all the times I shot stuff with guns when I was a kid or got shot at.
[23:49.640 --> 23:53.840]  Yeah, the fact that it's it's no effort to accidentally use one
[23:53.840 --> 23:55.080]  is the scariest thing to me.
[23:55.120 --> 23:58.900]  Like with a knife, you can cut yourself or you can accidentally, you know, glance.
[23:59.120 --> 24:01.840]  But you're never going to accidentally stab someone in the heart.
[24:02.880 --> 24:06.040]  But a gun, you could it could just go off straight through someone's eye.
[24:06.260 --> 24:09.280]  Dude, I was reading the other day that something just happened.
[24:10.820 --> 24:14.040]  Tragic, but a mom like had a gun in her purse
[24:14.040 --> 24:17.520]  and was like fumbling for her keys and the gun went off and shot her daughter.
[24:18.000 --> 24:19.120]  Like the safety wasn't on.
[24:19.480 --> 24:21.100]  Like that's what guns can do.
[24:21.380 --> 24:23.260]  But I'm not trying to turn this into an anti-gun thing.
[24:23.320 --> 24:25.360]  I'm sorry. I just get skeeved out when we talk about guns.
[24:25.800 --> 24:26.140]  That's fair.
[24:26.180 --> 24:27.400]  Hey, I'm sorry for bringing up guns.
[24:27.880 --> 24:28.480]  Oh, it's OK.
[24:28.660 --> 24:30.960]  We use them to shoot aliens in Halo all day long.
[24:34.500 --> 24:38.400]  I I recently watched the Vietnam draft, which is a draft.
[24:38.400 --> 24:41.420]  I don't think we should try to do, but it was weird.
[24:43.840 --> 24:46.020]  Are you talking about the birthday draft?
[24:46.220 --> 24:49.600]  Yeah, I was watching the birthday draft and I got really into it.
[24:49.880 --> 24:53.540]  And because I think like one hundred eighty five and below
[24:53.540 --> 24:56.780]  were the people that were deployed, not knowing where my birthday was.
[24:56.840 --> 24:59.600]  It was very exciting to watch going, Oh, what I have.
[24:59.920 --> 25:00.920]  Where am I in this list?
[25:00.960 --> 25:02.120]  What I've been fine.
[25:02.540 --> 25:04.940]  I was not as like 53rd, unfortunately.
[25:06.220 --> 25:10.800]  But yeah, the combat that that's my recent thing with combat wars.
[25:11.240 --> 25:13.600]  I mean, while I don't know what you're talking about.
[25:13.700 --> 25:16.880]  So I was going to say, I bet Gavin doesn't even know what we're talking about.
[25:16.940 --> 25:19.840]  It's wild to think that in America
[25:20.680 --> 25:23.740]  during the Vietnam War, we had a Nash.
[25:23.840 --> 25:24.900]  We had a draft, right?
[25:24.920 --> 25:25.960]  You know, a draft is right, Gav.
[25:26.520 --> 25:27.920]  Yeah. Like like a military draft.
[25:28.300 --> 25:32.260]  Well, the way they determined who got drafted is they had a national
[25:32.260 --> 25:35.100]  birthday lottery where they would lotter.
[25:35.300 --> 25:40.200]  They would pull the fucking birthdays out of a bingo thing and be like April 3rd.
[25:40.260 --> 25:43.940]  If your birthday is on April 3rd and you're eligible, you just got drafted
[25:45.180 --> 25:48.680]  April 9th, June 4th, February 16th.
[25:48.680 --> 25:52.200]  And they went down through, I think, all 365 days.
[25:52.520 --> 25:55.520]  Yeah. And so then you would know, depending on how bad the war was going
[25:55.520 --> 26:00.100]  or how deep they had to go in, you knew where you were slotted to get drafted.
[26:00.100 --> 26:02.260]  And that's when a lot of people fled to Canada.
[26:02.600 --> 26:05.800]  So a lot of people started doing heavy drugs to disqualify them.
[26:06.040 --> 26:10.020]  When a lot of people started to get bones, splints and shit like that.
[26:10.160 --> 26:13.000]  Yeah. I feel like the government would have saved a lot of money
[26:13.000 --> 26:14.060]  on communal birthday cakes.
[26:17.160 --> 26:18.600]  Yeah, I guess so.
[26:19.160 --> 26:21.900]  It's just crazy to think that that was like, I just can't imagine
[26:22.640 --> 26:26.580]  in America today, everybody sitting around the TV, watching like NBC
[26:26.580 --> 26:30.880]  Nightly News to see when the next fucking birthday draft date is, you know?
[26:31.220 --> 26:33.060]  It's just like a very different world we live in now.
[26:33.120 --> 26:33.840]  Very different country.
[26:34.280 --> 26:36.120]  What's the cutoff? Am I too old for that now?
[26:36.500 --> 26:38.580]  I doubt they would want me a foreigner, but...
[26:38.580 --> 26:39.900]  How old are you? 35?
[26:40.760 --> 26:42.660]  I think you're not cut off just yet.
[26:42.740 --> 26:45.720]  I think 30. When I was in the army, I think 37 was the cutoff.
[26:45.780 --> 26:46.640]  I'm not sure what it is now.
[26:46.920 --> 26:49.380]  I'm sure I can't legally fight for a foreign military.
[26:49.760 --> 26:55.840]  All male citizens between the ages of 18 and 26 are required to register
[26:55.840 --> 27:00.220]  and are liable for training and service until the age of 35.
[27:00.860 --> 27:01.460]  There you go.
[27:02.340 --> 27:04.160]  Yeah, I think about that all the time.
[27:04.280 --> 27:07.420]  Like how lucky am I that no one got to just derail my whole life?
[27:08.500 --> 27:09.340]  Well, that much.
[27:13.940 --> 27:18.260]  You know, not that I wanted you to go into war, but it would have made the fact
[27:18.260 --> 27:22.300]  I still don't think you understand what a draft is, and I'm sure that would have helped.
[27:23.760 --> 27:25.600]  Would have given you a lesson.
[27:25.600 --> 27:29.400]  I think when we got to it on this show, you would have been a little bit more prepared.
[27:30.960 --> 27:33.420]  Fortunately, it wasn't a snake draft that they did.
[27:33.600 --> 27:34.760]  Yeah, that's true.
[27:34.880 --> 27:35.520]  That's a good point.
[27:35.720 --> 27:38.800]  I like the idea of just being handed my uniform and my boots and stuff.
[27:38.880 --> 27:40.440]  But I'm just like, so so what is this?
[27:40.580 --> 27:42.480]  How does this work? Where do we go?
[27:44.260 --> 27:45.820]  What sport are we going to go play?
[27:46.780 --> 27:48.180]  What network is covering this?
[27:48.660 --> 27:52.120]  Let me ask you guys a totally different question in a completely different direction.
[27:52.640 --> 27:54.080]  Is that OK? Of course.
[27:54.080 --> 27:57.260]  All right. When you think of Nicolas Cage,
[27:57.300 --> 27:58.640]  what's the first picture that comes to your mind?
[27:59.180 --> 28:00.600]  Snake eyes because of Eric now.
[28:00.940 --> 28:03.260]  OK, he's ruined. Definitely snake eyes.
[28:03.960 --> 28:07.900]  The second, I think my honest image is face off. OK.
[28:08.880 --> 28:09.680]  Nick said The Rock.
[28:09.960 --> 28:10.940]  Gracie said National Treasure.
[28:11.640 --> 28:12.460]  Gavin, what about you?
[28:12.820 --> 28:13.920]  What's that one he's in with Cher?
[28:14.980 --> 28:16.420]  Moonstruck. Yeah, that one.
[28:17.240 --> 28:18.880]  I think of Raising Arizona.
[28:19.460 --> 28:21.500]  Oh, one of my favorite movies.
[28:21.600 --> 28:22.780]  We were doing this the other night.
[28:22.780 --> 28:26.540]  Um, we were out at dinner and it was a lot of fun.
[28:26.660 --> 28:31.320]  We were just like, it's interesting what you pick, a figure that's been known
[28:32.120 --> 28:33.000]  through generations.
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.440]  And then everybody just thinks of the first image that comes to their mind.
[28:36.460 --> 28:38.600]  And it's just weird to see how far apart they all are.
[28:38.620 --> 28:39.760]  You know, like like Tom Cruise.
[28:39.780 --> 28:41.780]  What's the first Tom Cruise that comes to mind?
[28:42.680 --> 28:43.620]  Mission Impossible one.
[28:44.380 --> 28:45.080]  Top Gun probably.
[28:45.480 --> 28:48.060]  Eric, Nick said Risky Business. Top Gun.
[28:48.280 --> 28:49.380]  Yeah, Risky Business.
[28:49.920 --> 28:51.320]  Or maybe Cocktail.
[28:51.320 --> 28:54.860]  I think Risky Business is what I said the other day.
[28:54.960 --> 28:57.460]  But today, Cocktail was the first thing that came to my mind.
[28:57.780 --> 28:59.440]  Ooh, that movie's dog shit.
[28:59.860 --> 29:01.640]  I was about to say, maybe I should go back and watch that movie.
[29:01.760 --> 29:02.360]  But maybe I shouldn't.
[29:02.360 --> 29:03.120]  No, no, no, no.
[29:03.120 --> 29:03.940]  That movie sucks.
[29:04.340 --> 29:05.400]  Like Gavin's right.
[29:05.540 --> 29:07.180]  It's weird how bad it is.
[29:07.320 --> 29:10.220]  It like shouldn't be that bad for being such a thing that people know.
[29:10.900 --> 29:13.300]  Can you how about how about this one?
[29:13.380 --> 29:17.940]  Can you if I say George Washington, can you picture George Washington in your head?
[29:17.940 --> 29:18.780]  Uh huh.
[29:19.300 --> 29:19.460]  Yeah.
[29:20.720 --> 29:21.140]  Gav?
[29:23.700 --> 29:24.540]  Uh, yes.
[29:25.300 --> 29:27.180]  How how about Benjamin Franklin?
[29:27.640 --> 29:27.820]  Yeah.
[29:28.480 --> 29:29.540]  The 100 guy?
[29:30.180 --> 29:30.880]  Yeah. Yeah.
[29:32.320 --> 29:33.400]  How about John Adams?
[29:34.520 --> 29:35.520]  No idea who that is.
[29:35.680 --> 29:37.940]  I got no fucking picture of John Adams in my head.
[29:38.140 --> 29:39.260]  I just pulled Giamatti to me.
[29:39.580 --> 29:41.240]  I know the name. I just I can't see him.
[29:42.860 --> 29:44.040]  How about Winston Churchill?
[29:44.320 --> 29:45.880]  Like, I'm sure, Gavin, you can see Winston Churchill.
[29:46.360 --> 29:46.640]  Yeah.
[29:46.640 --> 29:48.180]  It's a gigantic bastard.
[29:48.360 --> 29:51.920]  I can't. I just I see like a vague heavyset guy with a hat on,
[29:52.020 --> 29:53.880]  but I see nothing about his face.
[29:54.620 --> 29:59.020]  Winston Churchill, in my mind, is Alfred Hitchcock in an after photo
[29:59.020 --> 30:00.760]  for like a diet supplement.
[30:02.040 --> 30:04.680]  It's a sleeker Hitchcock.
[30:05.720 --> 30:07.420]  He's a spruced up Hitchcock.
[30:07.840 --> 30:08.100]  He is.
[30:08.400 --> 30:10.180]  Was Hitchcock bigger than Churchill?
[30:11.000 --> 30:12.800]  I don't I don't think so.
[30:12.840 --> 30:14.500]  They're probably pretty equivalent, but my head is.
[30:19.980 --> 30:22.620]  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[30:23.140 --> 30:26.560]  You know, it can be difficult to manage your social battery.
[30:26.720 --> 30:28.800]  It's so easy to overextend yourself.
[30:29.480 --> 30:34.680]  It's something that I need to be very mindful of, even in online interaction.
[30:34.960 --> 30:38.200]  Like, I love connecting with people and talking to people in our community
[30:38.200 --> 30:41.920]  and just meeting, you know, new friends or whatever.
[30:42.260 --> 30:46.860]  But it comes at like a definite cost at times as far as your own personal energy.
[30:47.300 --> 30:50.380]  Can be easy to ignore social battery and spread ourselves thin,
[30:50.480 --> 30:53.820]  especially with social gatherings picking up after the winter.
[30:54.180 --> 30:57.720]  What's the right amount of socializing for you and how do you recharge?
[30:58.840 --> 31:01.400]  I personally recharge with downtime.
[31:01.580 --> 31:02.760]  I just need some time myself.
[31:03.060 --> 31:04.980]  I need to listen to some music or
[31:05.760 --> 31:09.640]  I don't know, an audio book, play some games just to decompress a little bit.
[31:09.760 --> 31:11.100]  For me, that's really important.
[31:11.200 --> 31:14.860]  But it's, you know, different for every person.
[31:15.620 --> 31:17.800]  And what I know is through therapy,
[31:17.920 --> 31:20.280]  which has been such an incredibly helpful process for me,
[31:20.840 --> 31:25.000]  that those are things I've talked about and have learned to set my own boundaries
[31:25.000 --> 31:28.180]  for and also just coming to terms with what my boundaries are.
[31:28.680 --> 31:31.940]  Therapy is something that has been tremendously helpful for me.
[31:32.720 --> 31:37.080]  So I would highly recommend that every person goes through the process
[31:37.080 --> 31:39.560]  at some point, even if you don't necessarily need it.
[31:39.660 --> 31:42.380]  It's just great being able to talk to an expert about things.
[31:42.960 --> 31:46.880]  So if you're thinking of starting therapy, give BetterHelp a try.

[32:10.400 --> 32:13.260]  What's the most famous name to least famous face?
[32:14.080 --> 32:15.180]  Oh, we talked about this before.
[32:15.300 --> 32:16.980]  So I think everyone came up with like Neil Armstrong.
[32:17.380 --> 32:19.460]  It's like not a lot of people would recognize his mug.
[32:19.980 --> 32:21.340]  Do voice actors count?
[32:21.860 --> 32:23.840]  Do we count characters? Famous enough?
[32:24.720 --> 32:28.680]  I feel like nobody necessarily knows what the Winnie the Pooh guy looks like,
[32:28.680 --> 32:30.540]  but a lot of people know Winnie the Pooh.
[32:30.620 --> 32:31.780]  Yeah. I don't know his name though.
[32:32.520 --> 32:33.820]  Cummings? Jim Cummings?
[32:34.200 --> 32:35.880]  Oh shit, we're in our cum era. Fuck.
[32:37.920 --> 32:40.900]  I feel like a lot of people would know
[32:40.900 --> 32:43.960]  Idina Manziel's work, but might not be able to picture.
[32:45.900 --> 32:48.580]  Idina Manziel's maybe the most famous fictional name.
[32:50.420 --> 32:51.380]  That's a good one.
[32:51.920 --> 32:52.940]  But that is her real name.
[32:53.640 --> 32:55.720]  That that is that is her real name.
[32:55.800 --> 32:58.160]  Yeah. Adele Dazeem was the other one.
[32:58.420 --> 33:01.460]  Oh, that's not me.
[33:02.020 --> 33:04.160]  I think more people know Adele Dazeem
[33:04.980 --> 33:07.000]  than Idina Manziel probably. Yeah.
[33:07.000 --> 33:08.700]  Yeah, that's immediate.
[33:08.940 --> 33:11.100]  My brain just thought that that's what you were saying.
[33:13.740 --> 33:15.460]  I thought that was really funny.
[33:16.220 --> 33:18.140]  And you're just saying an actual person.
[33:19.340 --> 33:20.940]  How about Susan Sarandon?
[33:21.720 --> 33:23.640]  What comes to mind? Her face?
[33:23.900 --> 33:27.580]  Oh, yeah, I guess.
[33:27.680 --> 33:29.340]  I don't know. Old ass Susan Sarandon.
[33:29.560 --> 33:30.420]  But like, not old ass.
[33:30.460 --> 33:32.240]  Like she she aged very well, but
[33:32.960 --> 33:34.640]  you just called her old ass.
[33:35.040 --> 33:36.660]  Yeah, but just because she is.
[33:36.660 --> 33:39.820]  But that doesn't like I said, it's worse than I intended.
[33:40.320 --> 33:42.980]  When do you transition from old to old ass?
[33:43.840 --> 33:44.780]  Or is it the other way around?
[33:47.380 --> 33:49.700]  I I was going to say Bull Durham, by the way.
[33:49.760 --> 33:50.580]  That's what I thought of.
[33:50.680 --> 33:53.840]  I didn't I didn't think of either that or bangers.
[33:53.940 --> 33:56.040]  I picture season seven of Friends.
[33:57.360 --> 33:58.640]  OK. Oh, that's specific.
[34:00.520 --> 34:03.700]  It's like holes or maybe alien, probably alien.
[34:04.420 --> 34:05.600]  Alien. Alien.
[34:06.200 --> 34:07.840]  Oh, fuck. That's Sigourney Weaver.
[34:08.080 --> 34:10.340]  Listen, I'm sick. I'm sick.
[34:10.540 --> 34:11.660]  You're all over the place.
[34:11.900 --> 34:15.200]  I'm all over the I just I space for a minute.
[34:15.340 --> 34:18.920]  It went famous red haired woman and Sigourney Weaver.
[34:19.080 --> 34:20.380]  Sigourney Weaver doesn't have red hair.
[34:20.720 --> 34:24.480]  All right. So when you picture Sigourney Weaver, he's clearly alien.
[34:24.900 --> 34:26.500]  I think it's Ghostbusters.
[34:26.700 --> 34:27.120]  What about you?
[34:27.680 --> 34:29.120]  Now you see Burnett.
[34:29.360 --> 34:31.860]  Yes. Listen, I'm trying.
[34:33.240 --> 34:36.020]  And maybe we are learning that Andrew can't picture anything.
[34:36.240 --> 34:38.960]  No, well, it's been it's funny you say that's been a problem.
[34:39.240 --> 34:42.980]  I've been playing a post blink of it, this movie trivia game.
[34:43.140 --> 34:46.900]  And I keep learning that my memory for movies is not accurate.
[34:47.120 --> 34:49.580]  I keep Mandela affecting myself.
[34:50.900 --> 34:53.700]  Are you Mandela effecting or Adina Manzella effecting?
[34:54.140 --> 34:55.840]  I think maybe a little bit of both.
[34:55.920 --> 34:57.060]  Maybe calling A and calling B.
[34:57.420 --> 35:00.320]  There was a category for oh, well, that is.
[35:00.320 --> 35:01.360]  Yeah, that's Susan Sarandon.
[35:01.620 --> 35:03.220]  All right. Look at that.
[35:03.400 --> 35:06.660]  In Friends, season seven, Gracie.
[35:08.560 --> 35:10.360]  So in the game, it'll be like this actress.
[35:10.520 --> 35:13.280]  Name a movie that this actor actress is in.
[35:13.340 --> 35:14.260]  That's one word.
[35:15.020 --> 35:19.020]  And the question was Amy Adams was the actor.
[35:19.620 --> 35:21.180]  And I thought Amelia.
[35:21.440 --> 35:23.500]  She was in a fucking Amelia Earhart movie.
[35:23.820 --> 35:25.220]  Got this. Locked it up.
[35:25.520 --> 35:27.260]  It said no. I was so outraged.
[35:27.320 --> 35:28.000]  I googled it.
[35:28.360 --> 35:29.780]  That's a Hilary Swank movie.
[35:29.780 --> 35:34.680]  But for like the last 13 or 14 years, that was I have a distinct memory
[35:34.680 --> 35:37.860]  of being in a theater scene, that trailer with Amy Adams in it going,
[35:38.120 --> 35:39.460]  oh, that was really good casting.
[35:39.820 --> 35:41.320]  That's a great good move by them.
[35:41.460 --> 35:44.920]  But I think what it was is Amy Adams played Amelia Earhart in Night
[35:44.920 --> 35:45.940]  at the Museum, too.
[35:46.460 --> 35:50.160]  And over time, my brain just swapped it into
[35:50.160 --> 35:51.860]  she was in the Amelia Earhart movie.
[35:52.220 --> 35:54.020]  And this just keeps happening to me.
[35:54.040 --> 35:57.340]  So I don't think I'm a reliable narrator for movie history.
[35:57.420 --> 35:58.320]  Geoff lost a car to this game.
[35:58.320 --> 36:00.420]  I did lose a car to this game once.
[36:00.540 --> 36:00.900]  That's true.
[36:01.140 --> 36:03.980]  If you talk about Amy Adams, I have a different problem with Amy Adams.
[36:04.140 --> 36:07.600]  I cannot tell Amy Adams and Isla Fisher apart.
[36:08.060 --> 36:09.700]  Oh, yeah, I could see that.
[36:09.820 --> 36:11.180]  They're the same person to me.
[36:11.200 --> 36:13.260]  And I never know which one I'm watching in a movie.
[36:15.140 --> 36:16.460]  That's yeah, that's fair.
[36:16.720 --> 36:20.320]  I had the most recent one for me, and I think this is fucking outrageous.
[36:20.440 --> 36:21.800]  I'd love to know the years of these movies.
[36:22.480 --> 36:27.680]  It was a Kevin Costner one word film title was what I was trying to figure out.
[36:28.320 --> 36:31.280]  And I thought, oh, he's in he's in selfless.
[36:31.500 --> 36:36.120]  He's in that movie where like Ryan Reynolds gets put into him or something.
[36:36.260 --> 36:38.380]  It's it's like Ryan Reynolds gets put into a guy.
[36:38.480 --> 36:40.220]  I put it in and it was wrong.
[36:40.420 --> 36:42.900]  And it's like, well, what is Kevin Costner?
[36:42.980 --> 36:45.200]  Ryan Reynolds is definitely in a movie where this happens.
[36:45.340 --> 36:46.100]  What is this movie?
[36:46.520 --> 36:47.680]  And so I looked up selfless.
[36:48.240 --> 36:52.860]  Selfless is about Ben Kingsley getting put into the body of Ryan Reynolds.
[36:53.220 --> 36:57.360]  And then he made a movie called Criminal in which Ryan Reynolds
[36:57.360 --> 36:59.420]  gets put into the body of Kevin Costner.
[36:59.620 --> 37:02.180]  They're two different movies making Freaky Friday.
[37:02.880 --> 37:06.340]  But it's not it's like his brain is getting put in a shell.
[37:06.480 --> 37:07.520]  It's not like they switch.
[37:07.800 --> 37:10.680]  It's like the body is gone and he is now taking.
[37:11.120 --> 37:14.820]  But it's very weird that Ryan Reynolds is in, I think, back to back films
[37:14.820 --> 37:19.000]  where in one his brain gets put in another guy and in another one
[37:19.860 --> 37:22.300]  someone else's brain gets put into his body.
[37:22.760 --> 37:27.000]  Very like the whole Kevin Kline thing again, where he keeps playing two people
[37:27.000 --> 37:28.660]  and then one person impersonates the other.
[37:28.840 --> 37:30.840]  Yes, but he's on both sides.
[37:31.020 --> 37:35.020]  I think how many movies have Ed Harris is like the controller guy?
[37:35.720 --> 37:36.900]  Well, that's his role.
[37:37.100 --> 37:39.120]  That's his job. Yeah.
[37:39.660 --> 37:43.160]  He's got probably most of them, probably like 40 percent of the films
[37:43.160 --> 37:44.140]  that Ed Harris is in.
[37:44.580 --> 37:47.640]  Paula 13, Gravity, Truman Show.
[37:47.780 --> 37:49.360]  He's always like the guy.
[37:49.720 --> 37:50.520]  That's a great point.
[37:52.820 --> 37:54.160]  He's got the guy energy.
[37:54.680 --> 37:57.660]  When you think of I'm going to do one more.
[37:57.860 --> 37:58.700]  Jack Nicholson.
[37:58.920 --> 38:00.600]  What's the first Jack Nicholson that comes to mind?
[38:00.860 --> 38:01.620]  The Shining. Joker.
[38:02.260 --> 38:03.660]  The Joker. All right.
[38:03.700 --> 38:04.360]  The Shining.
[38:06.200 --> 38:07.340]  Joker says Eric.
[38:08.480 --> 38:09.540]  Nick and Gracie.
[38:09.860 --> 38:10.320]  Joker.
[38:11.300 --> 38:12.940]  It's a heavy Joker. That's interesting.
[38:13.720 --> 38:15.140]  For me, it's Witches of Eastwick.
[38:15.220 --> 38:17.920]  I have no idea why, but that's like the Jack Nicholson.
[38:18.160 --> 38:19.800]  What is Witches of Eastwick? Really?
[38:20.260 --> 38:21.640]  Yeah. Wow.
[38:22.280 --> 38:26.340]  Yeah, that was a big movie when I was when I was like whatever age I was.
[38:26.440 --> 38:29.300]  I remember all the moms being into it because it was like a sexy kind of thing.
[38:29.460 --> 38:30.540]  And I just remember him.
[38:30.740 --> 38:34.360]  It was like the height of like every all the women in although like adult
[38:34.360 --> 38:37.580]  women around me being really into Jack Nicholson around that era.
[38:38.240 --> 38:39.660]  And so that's like Witches.
[38:39.760 --> 38:40.940]  That's just the first thing that comes to mind.
[38:41.080 --> 38:42.340]  It's a Susan Sarandon movie.
[38:42.920 --> 38:44.320]  And Susan Sarandon's in it as well, yeah.
[38:45.240 --> 38:49.300]  One of my favorite behind the scenes clips is a Jack Nicholson
[38:49.300 --> 38:50.880]  on the set of The Shining.
[38:51.140 --> 38:54.420]  And he's just about to do the scene where he puts the axe through the door.
[38:54.980 --> 38:57.260]  And he's just like, like smack in his head.
[38:57.300 --> 38:58.560]  He's like, ah, ah.
[38:58.680 --> 39:00.740]  And he's warming up before actually he's like, kill.
[39:01.000 --> 39:02.240]  And there's just some like A.D.
[39:04.040 --> 39:06.780]  walking and like having to dodge his axe as if he's not there.
[39:06.860 --> 39:08.280]  It's just like such a British moment.
[39:08.400 --> 39:11.700]  It's like one of the most iconic scenes in movie history.
[39:11.800 --> 39:13.940]  Some guys just like, oh, you almost hit me with the axe.
[39:14.660 --> 39:19.000]  Dan, I saw a video just yesterday on TikTok of some behind the scenes
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.440]  of like Stanley Kubrick just berating Shelley Duvall in that scene.
[39:23.940 --> 39:30.380]  But Kubrick and Hitchcock were just complete bastards on set to women.
[39:30.720 --> 39:34.500]  Apparently. Or just, well, yeah, to women, but to in general, yeah.
[39:35.340 --> 39:37.340]  Yeah, Hitchcock was problematic for sure.
[39:37.960 --> 39:41.800]  But he just like, you just like, God, what a fucking prick, you know, sucked.
[39:43.140 --> 39:45.040]  Oh, I wish I had those pajamas.
[39:45.420 --> 39:47.080]  Uh-huh. Where's your pajamas?
[39:47.540 --> 39:50.500]  Those Jack Nicholson's wearing in that image that Eric shed.
[39:51.120 --> 39:53.680]  It's from Witches of Eastwick. That's where he's hot, right?
[39:54.020 --> 39:57.840]  That's where all your adult women in 1987 said, that's the hot guy.
[39:58.260 --> 40:00.860]  Yeah, well, maybe maybe not that exact image, but yeah.
[40:01.620 --> 40:03.340]  I posted that clip.
[40:03.340 --> 40:06.870]  Are you ready, Ron?
[40:07.170 --> 40:07.470]  Yeah.
[40:10.260 --> 40:12.020]  Oh, come on, Dexter!
[40:12.980 --> 40:13.940]  Come on!
[40:15.220 --> 40:16.260]  Right on, you're ready, aren't you?
[40:16.300 --> 40:17.100]  We're waiting for Shelley!
[40:17.540 --> 40:17.940]  Bye!
[40:18.040 --> 40:21.160]  What Laker scenario do you think he was imagining to get him into this zone?
[40:21.540 --> 40:22.380]  Get him into this place?
[40:23.620 --> 40:25.740]  The little guy in the jumper, just like...
[40:27.700 --> 40:28.880]  He's just like, fuck, Jesus.
[40:30.440 --> 40:32.560]  He's dodging the apeshit, Nicholson.
[40:34.440 --> 40:36.460]  I love the idea that he's imagining
[40:36.460 --> 40:39.140]  the Showtime Lakers in the scheme where they just have to pass around
[40:39.140 --> 40:40.460]  and shoot no matter where they're at.
[40:41.180 --> 40:44.360]  And he's just like, it's not working, it's not working, get fired up.
[40:47.900 --> 40:52.480]  You know how people will feed fish to fish to catch fish?
[40:53.700 --> 40:54.060]  Sure.
[40:54.420 --> 40:57.940]  Wait, so you put like a minnow on a hook to catch a bass, right?
[40:58.100 --> 40:58.260]  Yeah.
[40:58.600 --> 41:03.700]  You put you use a minnow to catch a barracuda, a barracuda to catch a shark.
[41:04.420 --> 41:06.060]  A shark to catch a whale.
[41:10.080 --> 41:12.960]  That is a reference that maybe one person will get.
[41:13.120 --> 41:15.020]  And let me know if you're that person.
[41:15.440 --> 41:16.800]  What the fuck?
[41:17.220 --> 41:18.740]  I mean, it's anyone here, is it?
[41:18.840 --> 41:19.780]  No, it's not.
[41:19.940 --> 41:20.740]  That's fine.
[41:20.920 --> 41:24.200]  I did that knowingly, but there's someone out there.
[41:26.200 --> 41:29.400]  There's someone out there that is very happy about that.
[41:29.440 --> 41:31.060]  And let me know who you are.
[41:31.660 --> 41:32.700]  Andrew's audience of one.
[41:34.940 --> 41:39.800]  Uh, well, yeah, I've been I don't know if you guys know this, but trucks has been replaced by fish.
[41:40.340 --> 41:44.060]  We've been fishing for a bit now, and I'm real, real into fish.
[41:44.140 --> 41:48.540]  As a matter of fact, as soon as I'm done with this stupid podcast, I'm going to do some fishing, trying to catch some some catfish.
[41:48.620 --> 41:49.540]  You got to catch up at night.
[41:49.700 --> 41:53.620]  You got to catch them between the 1900 and 600 hours.
[41:54.300 --> 41:55.160]  So it's a whole thing.
[41:55.780 --> 41:57.340]  Call of the Wild, the angler.
[41:58.360 --> 41:59.280]  It's fucking awesome.
[41:59.340 --> 42:00.020]  It's on Game Pass.
[42:00.020 --> 42:06.560]  It's an open world fishing game where you're in like a national park and you have a jeep and a boat and it's multiplayer.
[42:07.020 --> 42:07.640]  You can go anywhere.
[42:07.820 --> 42:08.660]  It's fucking wild.
[42:08.800 --> 42:09.200]  It's great.
[42:10.000 --> 42:13.720]  I've got you at 200 percent in Discord for some reason, and that was a mistake.
[42:21.680 --> 42:27.760]  Anyway, so I've been I've been I've been living that fish life for a while, and I got to thinking yesterday.
[42:28.400 --> 42:37.700]  Do you think anybody's ever fed like used freshwater fish to catch a saltwater fish or saltwater fish to catch a freshwater fish?
[42:37.860 --> 42:45.620]  And if so, if the fish thought it tasted exotic for a second and really interesting, like, whoa, that's a different flavor.
[42:45.780 --> 42:46.540]  I've never had that before.
[42:46.540 --> 42:48.080]  Or they're like, what the fuck?
[42:48.100 --> 42:50.240]  It's all it's like salty and gross.
[42:50.400 --> 42:51.140]  You know what I mean?
[42:51.580 --> 42:55.100]  I feel like for some reason that's going to cause some sort of mad fish disease.
[42:55.500 --> 42:57.320]  Oh, like it's just.
[42:59.360 --> 43:04.480]  Yeah, well, there's that there's those places in the ocean where you can see the freshwater on top of the saltwater.
[43:04.660 --> 43:05.040]  Brackish.
[43:05.480 --> 43:06.600]  Yeah, surface.
[43:06.820 --> 43:12.680]  I wonder if the most daring of fish try and like sneak in and get a meal and sneak back into their environment.
[43:12.860 --> 43:14.560]  Like how long can you hold your breath kind of thing?
[43:14.700 --> 43:17.740]  Like how far out can you swim before your buddy dares you to swim into the freshwater?
[43:18.520 --> 43:19.080]  Like see how far.
[43:19.160 --> 43:20.460]  It was fucking so weird, man.
[43:20.540 --> 43:21.020]  It was so weird.
[43:21.120 --> 43:21.820]  I was moving so slow.
[43:22.380 --> 43:23.100]  Fucking gross.
[43:25.100 --> 43:25.980]  My eyes are burning.
[43:27.540 --> 43:28.460]  Yeah, I don't know.
[43:28.720 --> 43:34.060]  Surely there's some like big time regulation fishers out there listening.
[43:34.280 --> 43:34.820]  Let me know.
[43:34.900 --> 43:42.220]  You ever like catch a shark with a bass or like, you know, catch a bass with a eel?
[43:43.400 --> 43:46.220]  I feel like fishing is pretty big with in VR.
[43:47.540 --> 43:48.000]  Oh, yeah.
[43:48.320 --> 43:48.920]  Oh, really?
[43:49.680 --> 43:50.700]  Have you ever tried that, Geoff?
[43:50.700 --> 43:56.380]  No, I you know, I we have that stupid Oculus and I keep meaning to fuck with it, but I never get around to it.
[43:56.500 --> 43:58.220]  Supposedly you can watch NBA games in it, too.
[43:58.800 --> 43:59.320]  Oh, yeah, you can.
[43:59.400 --> 43:59.820]  It's awesome.
[44:00.100 --> 44:00.780]  It's really cool.
[44:02.200 --> 44:07.260]  I bought an original Oculus, and that's literally all I did with it was watch NBA games.
[44:07.580 --> 44:08.260]  It's fantastic.
[44:08.440 --> 44:08.800]  Pretty awesome.
[44:09.540 --> 44:10.980]  Why? Was it like 3D?
[44:11.360 --> 44:12.840]  It is 3D.
[44:13.080 --> 44:20.580]  And your two camera perspectives, at least at that time, was you could either be on the backboard or you could be on like the side
[44:20.580 --> 44:23.260]  seats and you dictate where you see.
[44:24.080 --> 44:26.300]  So I spent like most of the game.
[44:26.480 --> 44:32.080]  It actually was kind of annoying because I saw a player step out of bounds while on the backboard that didn't get called by the ref.
[44:32.180 --> 44:33.440]  And I was like, that's fucking bullshit.
[44:34.500 --> 44:35.860]  His foot was out.
[44:36.980 --> 44:42.260]  But it's fun because you can just spend the game literally just watching the coaches, which is what I did, because you don't see that perspective.
[44:42.460 --> 44:44.660]  Just seeing them move up and down and like how they interact.
[44:44.900 --> 44:49.040]  And I wonder how many viewers they had in in 3D.
[44:49.720 --> 44:50.740]  Like headset viewers.
[44:51.820 --> 44:52.880]  I don't know.
[44:53.220 --> 44:56.920]  It was a thing where you needed to have a subscription to NBA League Pass and then.
[44:57.580 --> 45:00.820]  Yeah, they have like a game a week available or something for you to do it.
[45:00.880 --> 45:01.380]  I have it all.
[45:01.440 --> 45:02.420]  I just haven't set it up.
[45:02.740 --> 45:05.420]  They have a bunch of they do the UFC, too, and like racing.
[45:05.840 --> 45:10.060]  Do you think that sort of like VR and augmented reality stuff is like the future of watching sport?
[45:10.120 --> 45:15.140]  Because I don't know how much longer cable is going to be around to watch, you know, the 76ers play or whatever.
[45:15.640 --> 45:18.900]  But there has to be a future to like watching sports from home.
[45:19.040 --> 45:20.460]  Do you think it's that?
[45:20.620 --> 45:26.200]  Do you think it's like or do you think it's too novel to be watching it that way instead of like a full broadcast?
[45:26.780 --> 45:28.620]  I think it's too novel still.
[45:29.440 --> 45:31.240]  I think it's definitely that.
[45:31.320 --> 45:40.020]  But we're far from it still, because as much as I enjoyed it, it's still it wasn't necessarily fun to wear a VR headset for three hours watching the sporting event.
[45:40.180 --> 45:41.720]  Like, it's just not comfortable after a while.
[45:41.740 --> 45:43.040]  I don't think any headset is comfortable.
[45:43.680 --> 45:44.700]  Yeah, I'm with Gavin.
[45:44.920 --> 45:47.020]  I don't think I like, especially with the schnoz.
[45:49.040 --> 45:51.120]  I think that's the thing that'll keep people from doing that.
[45:51.180 --> 46:00.040]  But have you seen the league past stuff with like the augmented reality that shows like shot prediction percents and everything like pass out to like James Harden?
[46:00.120 --> 46:04.340]  It'll say like if he shoots from here, it'll be like forty nine percent and it like changes in real time.
[46:04.580 --> 46:08.640]  And it will show you like an overview of the court as like the play takes place.
[46:09.060 --> 46:12.220]  Like, I wonder if that's the way sports goes.
[46:12.660 --> 46:16.260]  Do you think James Harden is just playing in a different viewing perspective?
[46:16.500 --> 46:17.800]  Because what is he doing?
[46:17.800 --> 46:19.300]  Like, he changed his FOV.
[46:19.900 --> 46:21.920]  Yeah, like, well, he's trying to block his own guys.
[46:22.040 --> 46:23.160]  Like, what is up with that?
[46:23.340 --> 46:25.340]  He was the best highlight.
[46:25.980 --> 46:26.780]  Oh, that's so funny.
[46:26.840 --> 46:27.480]  That was so cool.
[46:27.640 --> 46:29.820]  I was like that made me like Harden a little bit.
[46:29.880 --> 46:31.460]  And it happened like that was great.
[46:33.340 --> 46:44.600]  Uh, what would be cool is if I could be courtside watching an NBA game like that, but also but instead of sitting in a seat, I'm sitting on a dock and I'm also fishing at the same time.
[46:46.360 --> 46:55.080]  I think I think it'd be sweet with augmented reality to just to project a pond wherever you are and just start fishing in front of people.
[46:55.680 --> 46:56.980]  Yeah, that'd be pretty cool.
[46:57.100 --> 47:05.760]  Like, if you could catch if you could cast a line into the middle of an NBA court and start catching stuff, that'd be that'd be a sick experience.
[47:06.240 --> 47:12.460]  It would be even better if like if there was like collision detection and if a player could like knock the fish off the line.
[47:12.460 --> 47:14.880]  Yeah, like run through the ball.
[47:15.000 --> 47:22.820]  Yeah, it's like the 21st century version of practicing your golf swing in public.
[47:23.260 --> 47:24.680]  People are having a conversation.
[47:24.820 --> 47:28.100]  You're just you're fishing in front of a target like that's great.
[47:28.440 --> 47:30.700]  I love the idea of it catching on to it before you know it.
[47:30.760 --> 47:35.340]  The crowd shots of NBA are just all people casting a line at the same time, like the wave.
[47:37.860 --> 47:43.860]  Like a Google Glass version of Wii Sports, just a line and it's like they're boxing someone.
[47:44.360 --> 47:52.740]  Yeah, if there was any future tech that I would take, I'm not really into any of this like subdermal stuff and people putting chips on their brains and all that.
[47:53.040 --> 47:59.860]  But if there was just a tiny chip in my finger and it was like a clipboard for myself, I would have that.
[48:00.260 --> 48:04.380]  Yeah, I would copy onto it and I would paste from it onto any device.
[48:04.380 --> 48:05.380]  I would definitely take that.
[48:05.820 --> 48:10.080]  I am sick of typing in a password with a fricking Apple TV remote.
[48:11.000 --> 48:12.220]  Yeah, it's terrible.
[48:12.800 --> 48:14.480]  Yeah, it's a navigational thing.
[48:14.780 --> 48:16.500]  Can't you do it with your doesn't it?
[48:16.500 --> 48:18.440]  I'll pop up the thing that says do it on your phone.
[48:19.020 --> 48:21.440]  You can if it decides to pop up.
[48:21.560 --> 48:22.980]  But yeah, what's the deal with that?
[48:23.100 --> 48:25.540]  That's like a thanks for bringing that up.
[48:25.620 --> 48:27.680]  That shit works like 30 percent of the time.
[48:27.860 --> 48:29.480]  Here I am trying to offer it as a solution.
[48:29.540 --> 48:34.180]  I don't know why, because it drives me fucking crazy all the goddamn time.
[48:34.380 --> 48:37.600]  It's so ambiguous when it decides to want to do it.
[48:37.720 --> 48:41.800]  And it's not like you have the option to go, hey, can I use you as a keyboard right now?
[48:42.000 --> 48:43.080]  Hello, please.
[48:43.140 --> 48:44.740]  Is there a button I can hit to use you as a keyboard?
[48:44.740 --> 48:45.940]  Fuck, I'm sorry to get me mad.
[48:46.480 --> 48:47.120]  Yeah, no, you're right.
[48:47.780 --> 48:50.540]  I would pay like a higher tier for an app.
[48:51.280 --> 48:57.320]  Like say it was like $8.99, I'd pay like $9.99 if I never got signed out ever.
[48:58.140 --> 49:02.760]  I want to be signed in for the rest of my shitty life for a dollar a month.
[49:03.120 --> 49:04.140]  Yeah, I'm right there with you.
[49:04.380 --> 49:08.080]  If I could pay for any future tech, it'd be a service called Ball Don't Lie.
[49:08.620 --> 49:11.440]  And it's just VR from the perspective of balls and sports.
[49:12.000 --> 49:13.220]  I want to be a baseball.
[49:13.580 --> 49:14.720]  I want to be tennis ball.
[49:15.080 --> 49:16.340]  I want the eyes of a hockey puck.
[49:16.540 --> 49:19.980]  I would vomit constantly because that's going to be very jarring.
[49:20.360 --> 49:24.340]  But I want to feel what the puck is or like in tennis.
[49:24.480 --> 49:25.440]  I think that'd be so much fun.
[49:25.760 --> 49:29.020]  It's flying back and forth, trying to like figure out what's going on.
[49:29.240 --> 49:29.920]  That'd be great.
[49:31.480 --> 49:32.440]  Baseball home run.
[49:32.900 --> 49:37.240]  Imagine if you saw your house from the peak of the ball during a home run.
[49:37.760 --> 49:38.380]  Oh, it'd be amazing.
[49:39.660 --> 49:40.940]  That would be pretty fucking amazing.
[49:41.060 --> 49:41.960]  That'd be my number one service.
[49:42.520 --> 49:46.800]  Speaking of amazing, the Do We Do came out,
[49:47.360 --> 49:50.580]  which we were holding until all of Does It Do was finished.
[49:51.120 --> 49:51.720]  Oh, it's out now?
[49:51.840 --> 49:53.580]  I know. Yeah, I wish we recorded.
[49:54.240 --> 49:56.100]  I wonder when we recorded that. Like a year ago?
[49:56.700 --> 49:57.960]  At least a year ago. Longer.
[49:58.180 --> 49:59.800]  Oh, yeah, I think it was probably longer. Yeah.
[49:59.800 --> 50:06.300]  And it's amazing to hear what that season of Does It Do could have been if we'd have
[50:07.840 --> 50:10.080]  turned all of what we said into what actually happened.
[50:10.660 --> 50:12.380]  And Eric was throwing his stuff.
[50:12.480 --> 50:13.960]  Eric was like, oh, you could do this to me.
[50:14.160 --> 50:15.040]  Eric didn't even show up.
[50:15.340 --> 50:16.000]  Eric wasn't even there.
[50:16.440 --> 50:19.400]  He's never been there for a filming of Does It Do.
[50:19.940 --> 50:20.560]  That's right.
[50:23.800 --> 50:25.500]  What an interesting...
[50:25.500 --> 50:29.300]  I'm so glad we filmed that and then held on to it for so many years.
[50:29.300 --> 50:30.260]  I haven't watched it yet.
[50:30.340 --> 50:31.400]  I got to go back and watch it.
[50:31.560 --> 50:35.360]  Did we have some good stuff in there that we had some great ideas in there?
[50:37.220 --> 50:38.020]  Oh, unbelievable.
[50:38.860 --> 50:41.560]  I guess we can hang on to them for whatever is next.
[50:42.000 --> 50:43.180]  I got news for you, man.
[50:43.380 --> 50:46.580]  I mean, ideas for the stuff we filmed that we didn't film.
[50:47.400 --> 50:50.860]  No matter what happens in our future going forward,
[50:50.860 --> 50:53.420]  and clearly there is a future going forward, yada, yada, yada.
[50:53.900 --> 50:56.700]  I don't see myself putting that polo on ever again.
[50:56.780 --> 50:58.580]  I think Does It Do is done.
[51:00.340 --> 51:02.060]  Two seasons is enough for me.
[51:03.500 --> 51:04.540]  It's very tiring.
[51:04.700 --> 51:07.780]  Anything we were going to try to redo, I think that is the thing
[51:07.780 --> 51:10.780]  that would be hilarious to redo in a Taylor Swift like way.
[51:12.120 --> 51:16.360]  You attempt a shot for shot remake of all of Does It Do would be hilarious.
[51:16.620 --> 51:17.280]  Oh, God damn.
[51:17.360 --> 51:20.300]  That's like the one show we make that actually requires budget.
[51:20.720 --> 51:22.400]  I guess with the break show as well.
[51:22.660 --> 51:24.760]  Did the last break show the other day.
[51:25.240 --> 51:25.920]  Oh, was it sad?
[51:26.480 --> 51:27.280]  Not really.
[51:28.560 --> 51:29.880]  Oh, no, I was fine.
[51:30.080 --> 51:33.600]  I mean, I'm still doing I'm still doing like daily rips on TikTok right now.
[51:33.860 --> 51:37.920]  So just to kind of keep that thing alive until we parlay the break show
[51:37.920 --> 51:41.460]  into whatever the new thing is, there'll be a version of it in the future.
[51:41.940 --> 51:43.660]  And where can people find that TikTok, Geoff?
[51:44.620 --> 51:46.460]  Where can they all on their phones?
[51:47.240 --> 51:48.100]  In the app.
[51:48.760 --> 51:51.100]  I don't think I don't think you can.
[51:51.200 --> 51:52.540]  I don't think you can go to TikTok.
[51:52.880 --> 51:53.960]  Is TikTok a website?
[51:54.060 --> 51:55.260]  Can you go to TikTok as a website?
[51:55.260 --> 51:58.500]  If you could go to it as a website, you can find it on TikTok.com.
[51:58.820 --> 52:01.700]  But I would I would recommend the app on your cell on your cell phone.
[52:02.400 --> 52:04.100]  Is that banned yet, the app?
[52:04.480 --> 52:07.260]  Not yet. Is it still going to be probably?
[52:07.560 --> 52:09.400]  I think it has to go through another vote, right?
[52:09.640 --> 52:12.640]  It'll probably get banned and then for they'll force a sale.
[52:12.760 --> 52:13.860]  I don't think it'll ever go away.
[52:13.960 --> 52:16.340]  It'll just be a time to be a VPN company.
[52:16.940 --> 52:18.420]  Didn't they also ban porn here?
[52:18.780 --> 52:20.740]  Yeah, in Texas. No porn for you.
[52:20.980 --> 52:23.520]  Not unless you give them your fucking birth certificate.
[52:24.180 --> 52:27.300]  And driver's license and fucking credit reference.
[52:27.620 --> 52:30.780]  I wonder if I don't like a benefit of filing taxes.
[52:30.940 --> 52:34.500]  I love how much personal freedom we have in Texas.
[52:34.740 --> 52:38.940]  This is a city, a big, big everything's bigger in Texas, bigger freedoms,
[52:40.180 --> 52:44.220]  bigger hoops to jump through to be a grown up and look at naked people.
[52:44.360 --> 52:45.700]  What the fuck, man?
[52:46.960 --> 52:51.420]  I had a I had a funny experience with your daily rep on TikTok, Geoff,
[52:51.420 --> 52:54.340]  where I was just swiping away.
[52:55.040 --> 52:58.420]  And then I got to a tick tock and it had a nugget buddy in it
[52:58.420 --> 53:02.160]  and they're going to rip cards and they showed the pack
[53:02.160 --> 53:03.680]  and was one of the monopoly prisms.
[53:03.780 --> 53:06.300]  And I went, Oh, Geoff always is opening those.
[53:06.380 --> 53:07.460]  And then I swapped.
[53:07.840 --> 53:10.820]  I just I kept I kept going, just kept moving on my life.
[53:11.000 --> 53:14.200]  And then like three hours later, I looked at the subreddit
[53:14.200 --> 53:17.900]  and there was a post about Geoff has a tick tock and he's doing card rips.
[53:17.900 --> 53:19.140]  And I was like, oh, fuck, cool.
[53:19.140 --> 53:22.420]  And I opened it and it was the video I just passed on through that.
[53:22.480 --> 53:26.020]  I went, oh, Geoff, Geoff opens those all the time and then moved on with my life.
[53:26.140 --> 53:30.000]  I had no idea it was your video or your channel.
[53:30.400 --> 53:32.660]  I'm not used to you making tick tocks.
[53:32.740 --> 53:36.860]  And I just swiped on through while having the thought of Geoff's
[53:36.860 --> 53:38.260]  always opening those funny.
[53:40.600 --> 53:42.580]  You're doing rips. I've been enjoying them.
[53:42.700 --> 53:46.820]  I've actually noticed since then I didn't swipe the next time it came.
[53:46.940 --> 53:48.880]  Oh, thanks, man. I've only done three or four.
[53:48.880 --> 53:51.180]  It's the channel's Geoff's daily rip.
[53:51.360 --> 53:53.080]  I wish somebody would have reminded me to say that.
[53:53.160 --> 53:54.920]  I almost forgot. But yeah, no problem.
[53:55.020 --> 53:56.720]  You can look it up on the tick tock.
[53:56.800 --> 53:59.920]  And then at some point it'll parlay into whatever, you know,
[54:00.040 --> 54:02.180]  wherever we land and whatever it looks like.
[54:02.220 --> 54:03.780]  I'll do some version of the break show again.
[54:03.980 --> 54:07.580]  I tried to buy a card off your eBay store, but no, no international shipping.
[54:07.940 --> 54:09.620]  No, not for my first time.
[54:09.940 --> 54:11.380]  And I'm not currently selling anything.
[54:12.040 --> 54:14.760]  That was just a test to see if I could do it and to see if I liked it.
[54:14.860 --> 54:16.480]  And I, you know, it was medium.
[54:16.980 --> 54:17.780]  We'll see if I do it again.
[54:18.680 --> 54:21.760]  Someday, maybe I'm looking at my notes.
[54:22.100 --> 54:25.940]  And we never found out
[54:25.940 --> 54:29.680]  if Gracie's insane claim of having a four minute tub was the truth.
[54:30.880 --> 54:31.360]  That's true.
[54:32.800 --> 54:34.880]  I mean, it's not it's not.
[54:35.140 --> 54:36.240]  There's no way it's the truth.
[54:38.780 --> 54:42.320]  Gracie, I mean, I didn't check at the four minute mark,
[54:42.320 --> 54:44.900]  I only checked at the eight because that was what we agreed on, but I mean, it was
[54:44.900 --> 54:46.420]  it was pretty damn full.
[54:46.420 --> 54:47.640]  What do you mean pretty damn full?
[54:47.720 --> 54:48.500]  So it wasn't full?
[54:48.600 --> 54:49.300]  Like I could have.
[54:49.920 --> 54:53.600]  No, no. I mean, like it was getting a little worrisome at eight.
[54:53.720 --> 54:55.500]  It was like overflowing in the drain.
[54:57.320 --> 54:59.180]  It was it was over the little drain.
[54:59.240 --> 55:00.000]  OK, yeah, OK.
[55:00.780 --> 55:01.180]  At eight.
[55:01.360 --> 55:02.140]  So it's less than eight.
[55:02.680 --> 55:05.020]  I think we just need to run it again and stop it at four.
[55:06.460 --> 55:07.320]  Yeah, I think it's four.
[55:07.440 --> 55:07.980]  You want me to go?
[55:08.060 --> 55:09.520]  I think there's four minutes left in the podcast.
[55:10.420 --> 55:11.480]  Yeah, that's how we're going to.
[55:11.520 --> 55:12.460]  Well, that's how we'll end this one.
[55:12.500 --> 55:14.740]  OK, OK, let me let me get my timer going.
[55:16.420 --> 55:17.280]  Be right back.
[55:17.340 --> 55:17.900]  All right.
[55:18.160 --> 55:20.320]  Got to close out all these f***ing face storylines.
[55:21.360 --> 55:22.200]  Yeah, this is good.
[55:22.500 --> 55:25.660]  Speaking of closing out storylines, I should mention I got my foundation fixed
[55:25.660 --> 55:27.300]  yesterday, sent you guys a video.
[55:27.560 --> 55:28.420]  Was it a one day job?
[55:29.440 --> 55:30.300]  Yeah, yeah.
[55:30.380 --> 55:32.080]  They got there at 7 a.m.
[55:32.080 --> 55:33.320]  and they were done by.
[55:34.520 --> 55:35.460]  I don't know, 6.45?
[55:35.680 --> 55:36.940]  No, probably 7, 7.30.
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.200]  Oh man, I thought that would have been like weeks of work.
[55:40.000 --> 55:41.060]  Dude, me too.
[55:41.200 --> 55:43.140]  They it was everything about it was awesome.
[55:43.520 --> 55:45.460]  It was awesomely scary.
[55:45.460 --> 55:46.980]  Awesomely fast.
[55:47.040 --> 55:47.960]  Awesomely efficient.
[55:48.720 --> 55:49.780]  Awesomely intimidating.
[55:50.000 --> 55:53.040]  There were 20 dudes here all day long.
[55:53.260 --> 55:56.180]  They dug holes under my house.
[55:56.260 --> 55:58.940]  They dug 21 holes under my house.
[55:59.140 --> 55:59.320]  Good God.
[55:59.620 --> 56:03.340]  And then under those 21 holes, they they buried.
[56:03.640 --> 56:08.140]  They sunk metal pylons, pylons 20 feet down.
[56:09.260 --> 56:10.480]  Into the ground. Wow.
[56:10.980 --> 56:14.540]  And then so they did that all the way around one side of my house
[56:14.540 --> 56:16.040]  and then in one spot on the other.
[56:16.580 --> 56:19.900]  And and then they so they had to dig up like giant swaths.
[56:19.940 --> 56:23.100]  They had to I have a concrete sidewalk that runs all the way down the side
[56:23.100 --> 56:24.260]  of one side of my house.
[56:24.440 --> 56:29.300]  They just had to cut sidewalk out and then fucking.
[56:29.500 --> 56:32.460]  I have these paver stones that are all like intricately put together.
[56:32.680 --> 56:34.040]  It's like my back deck kind of.
[56:34.380 --> 56:35.560]  They had to go through that.
[56:35.660 --> 56:38.620]  And so they had to cut like four foot by four foot holes through it.
[56:38.880 --> 56:43.720]  And they somehow managed to do it all and put it all back together
[56:43.720 --> 56:45.080]  like it had never happened.
[56:45.240 --> 56:46.560]  They poured new concrete.
[56:47.060 --> 56:51.460]  They they pried the pavers out and then put the paver, put concrete down
[56:51.460 --> 56:53.700]  and put the pavers back in and then went and got a grout
[56:53.700 --> 56:56.140]  that was the same color as the grout that they'd already used.
[56:56.300 --> 57:00.540]  They filled up the they replaced the grass where they dug.
[57:00.680 --> 57:01.860]  And I think it was wild.
[57:02.140 --> 57:03.900]  It's like it never happened.
[57:04.380 --> 57:08.440]  It was exhausting for 12 hours because every time I tried, they were like,
[57:08.480 --> 57:09.860]  you don't really need to come in the house or anything.
[57:10.620 --> 57:12.700]  But, you know, just it'll be noisy.
[57:12.700 --> 57:15.760]  And so I couldn't get any work done in the home, clearly.
[57:15.900 --> 57:16.700]  Let me know what's been four minutes.
[57:16.740 --> 57:18.200]  Could you feel the house move? That's fine.
[57:19.180 --> 57:20.660]  Yeah, that was part of the problem.
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.180]  I tried to go like work in the bedroom and the whole house was vibrating
[57:24.180 --> 57:25.280]  and it was loud.
[57:25.480 --> 57:27.980]  And so I tried to work in my closet and it was loud.
[57:28.060 --> 57:30.580]  And I tried to go to the other side of the house and they're working over there.
[57:30.620 --> 57:32.920]  And there was just no like place in the house I could get comfortable.
[57:33.340 --> 57:36.940]  And then like every time I tried to leave, like I'd get to the end of the block
[57:36.940 --> 57:39.240]  and I'd be like, hey, you're going to be back sometime soon.
[57:39.260 --> 57:40.720]  We actually do need to get in the house for a second.
[57:40.720 --> 57:42.960]  I'm like, uh, I'd be like, yeah, on my way back.
[57:43.060 --> 57:45.300]  And so like I got to I went to Thundercloud.
[57:46.260 --> 57:47.540]  Had I got called back?
[57:47.660 --> 57:51.020]  I went for a walk, got called back, went to take the dog to the daycare,
[57:51.080 --> 57:53.300]  got called back, picked the dog up, got called back.
[57:53.660 --> 57:56.360]  Wow. It was a little stressful in that way.
[57:56.540 --> 58:00.320]  But I went to bed and it was totally fucking done.
[58:00.420 --> 58:04.160]  And now it's just now I just got to get all the cracks that appeared fixed.
[58:04.580 --> 58:08.860]  But I can't believe that any of the holes in the hole really impressive.
[58:08.860 --> 58:10.140]  Were any of the holes suitable for beans?
[58:11.840 --> 58:14.800]  Oh, yeah, every every single one of them would have been a good bean.
[58:14.900 --> 58:17.660]  Oh, I could have had 21 bean holes.
[58:17.780 --> 58:19.740]  You should have just gotten to do one in our spot.
[58:20.700 --> 58:25.080]  Dude, it tells me the one thing I learned real fast is we suck at digging.
[58:26.760 --> 58:30.000]  Well, we put in a solid 40 minutes of effort before going to get lunch.
[58:32.040 --> 58:38.220]  That's true. I, uh, with the drilling and the filling of the hole and all that,
[58:38.220 --> 58:40.920]  it sounds to me like your house got a root canal adjacent.
[58:42.920 --> 58:44.320]  My house got a few root canals. Yeah.
[58:44.760 --> 58:46.760]  Hell yeah. Good for your house.
[58:47.340 --> 58:48.880]  It's very happy. It's very happy to be done.
[58:48.900 --> 58:50.360]  How's your how's your gob, Andrew?
[58:52.020 --> 58:52.780]  What does that mean?
[58:52.820 --> 58:53.580]  How's your mouth?
[58:53.840 --> 58:55.580]  My mouth. Oh, my mouth. Sorry.
[58:57.200 --> 58:58.100]  Well, you know what?
[58:58.120 --> 58:59.620]  That's interesting. Gobstopper.
[58:59.700 --> 59:00.900]  That now makes more sense.
[59:01.000 --> 59:02.240]  I never really considered.
[59:03.820 --> 59:05.160]  The origin of that.
[59:05.280 --> 59:07.660]  It's OK. I had three root canals.
[59:08.440 --> 59:10.060]  I'm dying in other ways to fly.
[59:10.240 --> 59:11.000]  I thought it was only two.
[59:11.240 --> 59:13.200]  No, I ended up having to have a third one.
[59:13.360 --> 59:15.260]  And I want one bad and two good.
[59:15.520 --> 59:18.480]  Now, I learned that every root canal is a bit different.
[59:18.660 --> 59:21.860]  And I think I had like, yeah, I had like the
[59:22.920 --> 59:26.220]  thankfully my first one was the most ideal experience I think you'd have.
[59:26.380 --> 59:28.160]  My second one was really bad.
[59:28.200 --> 59:30.720]  And then my third one was just sort of middle of the road.
[59:31.540 --> 59:34.180]  But a different different process each time.
[59:34.740 --> 59:37.160]  Yeah. Each root canal is like a shitty little snowflake.
[59:37.720 --> 59:38.620]  It is. Yeah.
[59:39.900 --> 59:44.520]  How old were you when you realized the snowflake picture was actually real?
[59:45.060 --> 59:49.040]  What do you make the fancy shape like the crystal sort of?
[59:50.420 --> 59:51.820]  I never questioned it was fake.
[59:52.100 --> 59:56.080]  Yeah, I think I think I learned that immediately upon learning about snowflakes.
[59:56.340 --> 59:58.480]  It feels like a weird thing for someone to lie to me about.
[59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.460]  I think I always or. Yeah.
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.140]  Huh. Is this something you figured out last week?
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.420]  No, no, no. I just do remember being older, though.
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:07.420]  I think I saw microscope footage.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.940]  I was like, oh, that's real snow.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.660]  When did you believe the moon landing footage?
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:13.900]  Like to what end?
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.260]  When did you learn about the moon landing footage?
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.300]  Gavin, did you know that the company's closing?
[01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:24.160]  Yeah. Oh, he doesn't believe it.
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:26.300]  So that still could be a joke.
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:28.580]  He's doing it. He Gavin's doing his own research.
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:31.700]  Oh, is that for what?
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.260]  Did Gracie just dong? What is this?
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.780]  I don't know what that is.
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.900]  Sorry. In AGIC, it's it's like a efficiency.
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:41.640]  Yeah, it's. Yeah, right.
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.420]  But that's a virus.
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:43.600]  Doesn't seem very efficient.
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:45.340]  I can't look. I'm sending a better version.
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:47.000]  Oh, I need to. I need to pay.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.620]  Oh, oh, I see it.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:49.520]  There you go. There it is.
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.120]  Oh, that's four minutes.
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:52.560]  Not even close to being full.
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:53.620]  Not even. No.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.660]  I would say it looks like it's an eight minute tongue.
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:56.600]  I think it's fuller than you think.
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.740]  Yeah. I mean, it's halfway, right?
[01:00:58.820 --> 01:00:59.900]  Hang on. It's still full.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:00.840]  I can take more pictures.
[01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:02.100]  It's still full.
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:04.100]  I think that's like, I think it's like halfway.
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:07.120]  Is that it's like a little over halfway.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:10.140]  Little over. Is that how full you fill a tub, Gracie?
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.200]  I mean, yeah, because my body makes the water rise a little higher.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:14.940]  Yeah, yeah. It's how it works.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.860]  I mean, OK, that picture is not doing it justice.
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:17.720]  You want me to take another one?
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:20.960]  No, I think I mean, I don't know how to best.
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:22.360]  I don't know how to best show.
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:23.400]  Can you put your phone?
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.120]  I would say it's a little over half.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.460]  Can you put a ruler in? Is your phone waterproof?
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:28.460]  That's good. Put your hand.
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.760]  Put put like your palm flat on the fingertip.
[01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:33.320]  Fingertip into the drain.
[01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:34.340]  Yeah. Fingertip down.
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:38.020]  Yeah, yeah. All the way down to like the drain and then or a banana water is.
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:40.820]  Yeah. Or a tape measure or a banana.
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:41.800]  Oh, yeah. There you go.
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:43.980]  I'll be back.
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.140]  OK, can you draw a ruler on your arm and then do it or a banana?
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.560]  No, but I'll stick my arm in it.
[01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:54.300]  You know, a good thing about the Umi Digi Bison is it's
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:56.780]  it's a waterproof camera in it.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:57.700]  It's got to have a think.
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:00.880]  If you took all the money you've spent on Umi Digis,
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.780]  you could have just bought one real phone.
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:07.280]  No, I think I'm halfway to a real phone.
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.400]  He doesn't. He doesn't.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.720]  Don't don't you mail him new phones pretty regularly?
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:13.020]  And I still got a package for him.
[01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:16.140]  I just I hate frickin sending stuff to Canada.
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:17.800]  It sucks. Why is it so annoying?
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:18.860]  I don't know, Andrew.
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:20.260]  You're Andrew.
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:23.140]  I don't want to make I want to keep making commercial invoices for junk.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.020]  I'm sending to
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.140]  Andrew Panton.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.880]  I will send that. I'll do it this week.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.800]  10 bucks says he doesn't do it this week.
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:31.760]  Wait, what day is it?
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:32.960]  Oh, no, I'll do it next week.
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:36.240]  I don't want to commit to one day of the one day left.
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:38.840]  Today's Wednesday, by the way.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:39.080]  Is it?
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.080]  Oh, I don't know what's going on.
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:46.700]  You're like Andrew trying to figure out who Susan Sarandon is.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.760]  I was about to say, did you know that Sigourney Weaver is, in fact, an alien?
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:51.320]  And that is not Susan Sarandon.
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.100]  I should. God damn it.
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:55.940]  Why? Whenever we film F*** Face, it feels like Thursday.
[01:02:57.260 --> 01:02:58.940]  It is the Thursday of show.
[01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:00.760]  You know what?
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:08.860]  When we move on to the new thing, we aren't beholden to any previous schedule.
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:13.380]  A lot of the days that we film stuff were days that fit into our rooster teeth calendar.
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:15.520]  Monday morning, 9 a.m.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.040]  No, we could, right?
[01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:18.720]  Terrible.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:20.510]  We could do anything.
[01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:21.800]  Why is that terrible?
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:22.510]  What about Thursday?
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:23.160]  What about 10?
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.260]  We could do Thursday afternoon.
[01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:27.240]  I'd say probably like 2 or 3.
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.440]  Oh, that sounds good.
[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:30.020]  Yeah, but why?
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:31.340]  Why?
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.460]  Because I like it.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:37.720]  Because Gavin didn't know what day it was because we didn't record on a Thursday today.
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:39.220]  So I don't know if I could do that.
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:39.820]  That is true.
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:43.780]  Wouldn't it be better if there would be a Band-Aid ripping period?
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:44.360]  But yeah.
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.340]  It's like when a dog knows it's dinner time.
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:48.780]  Yeah, wouldn't it be better if Mondays felt like Thursday?
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:51.220]  I think Monday would just feel like Monday going on.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.240]  I think Gracie drowned.
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:04:01.740]  If we did it on Monday, it would feel like Thursday, which means Tuesday would feel like Friday, which means Wednesday and Thursday you'd be chilling out like it's the weekend.
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:04.420]  Let's do it.
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:09.360]  And then by the time you're done with Thursday, which is really Sunday, it's Friday and it's time for the weekend again.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:24.160]  Well, why don't we record, right, 50 episodes of the new thing, starting at nine on a Monday and just pushing it forward an hour each day until we get to, what, 7 p.m.?
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:29.560]  And then we'll switch to 9 a.m. Tuesday and we'll go all through every day of the week and see which one was the best.
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:33.280]  I love this idea.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:36.180]  Gracie is assaulting us with high efficiency...
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.320]  A bunch of...
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:45.980]  Just want everyone to know, Geoff is saying he loves this idea, an idea that when I bring up in two weeks, when he forgets about it, he's going to go, why the fuck would we do that?
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:46.920]  It's going to be pretty exciting.
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:48.360]  Gavin will remind me.
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:53.780]  We finish the episode, right? Say we start at 10, we finish at 11. Next time we'll start at 11.
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:56.280]  It starts when it stops.
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:57.560]  It starts when it stops a week later.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.200]  That means we're always filming exactly seven days apart.
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:04.360]  Yes.
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:06.100]  That's brilliant.
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:10.040]  Gracie's struggling with this one.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.460]  Gracie was meant for this show.
[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:12.420]  Why is that really sinister?
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:19.560]  We need to put that on a fucking shirt.
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:20.160]  Oh my god.
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:22.080]  That is the funniest photo we've ever seen.
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:24.680]  I didn't know how else to get it.
[01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:29.160]  And your hair is black.
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:31.140]  We can't see it.
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:32.220]  Oh.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.820]  We're going to have to do it again.
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.040]  That is...
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:41.500]  Your first photo is by far the most helpful.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:42.580]  And determining.
[01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:45.260]  I took a lot. I tried to get every angle.
[01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:46.380]  Why is it so clear?
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:50.040]  That is totally the...
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.800]  This is the last photo taken of Gracie.
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:54.220]  Has anyone seen Gracie?
[01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:55.340]  Kind of photo.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:58.060]  And a top down, which tells us literally nothing.
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:01.020]  Oh my god.
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:03.660]  I don't feel like...
[01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.220]  I just need one of y'all to come see it.
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:06.200]  It's not doing it justice.
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:08.880]  You could sit in there very happily.
[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:11.280]  You need to put your phone on the other side.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:12.360]  Set out a timer.
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:14.760]  And then touch your fingertips against the bottom drain.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.960]  And have your arm resting against the top drain.
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:20.040]  So we can see how far up your arm.
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:21.300]  Between both drains.
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.120]  I think it's perfect.
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.220]  I don't think I care anymore.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:26.400]  Same.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:29.640]  I think I've done enough photography.
[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:32.360]  I just don't think we're ever going to beat those photos.
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:36.760]  It's a shame that Gracie came up with the perfect Slack profile picture.
[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:38.280]  Right at the end of the company.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.960]  How does Slack work?
[01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:44.460]  We gotta pay for it?
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:48.040]  No! I got a new Slack for the new thing.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:48.720]  But nobody replied.
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:50.820]  Slack sucks.
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:53.000]  I didn't get invited.
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:54.120]  You didn't put me in it.
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:56.360]  Gracie has an excuse.
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:57.400]  You were not in that group text.
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:06:59.900]  I'll send it to you.
[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:02.500]  Don't keep Gracie out.
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:04.240]  Oh, Eric.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.680]  Well, thanks for listening to this episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:09.760]  How many much more of these are there?
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:10.580]  A few.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.880]  But we did it.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.360]  We learned about Gracie's tub and so many other things.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.560]  Thank you guys so much.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.920]  We got one more of these to do today.
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.820]  So let's wrap this one up.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.540]  You can follow us on F*** Face Pod on Twitter and on Instagram.
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.580]  Not many much more to go ahead of us.
[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:28.140]  I love the idea of you psyching yourself up to butt in and say that.
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.880]  And then just flubbing it all over the floor.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.440]  Well, thank you so much.
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:33.740]  And we'll see you next time.
[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:34.260]  Bye.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.400]  Can I slack someone a different slack in a different slack?
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:41.660]  That's a good question.
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.400]  I don't always...
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.120]  Let's add people.
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.220]  I'm going to stop recording.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.140]  Yep.
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:52.080]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.960]  The boys again talk sports.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:55.480]  Gracie has heard enough.
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:56.880]  Have you had deja vu?
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:58.960]  What job are you going to get in the mall?
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:00.880]  Let's buy some moon shoes.
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.640]  Patton found a movie hack.
[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:04.880]  Gavin has too much mustache hair.
[01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:07.100]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:10.100]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:11.660]  Oh, and one last thing.
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.740]  On February 5th, 2024,
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.300]  at Andrew Panton tweeted,
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.420]  quote, if at Rooster Teeth engages
[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:19.200]  with this tweet, I'll eat the pencil.
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.380]  On April 1st, 2024,
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.040]  at Rooster Teeth responded,
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.740]  quote, eat lead, Patton. Pencil emoji.
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:27.340]  I just wanted to share that
[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:29.180]  for folks who might not be on Twitter anymore.
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:30.100]  See you next time.
