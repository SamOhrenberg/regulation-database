[00:15.070 --> 00:18.270]  So we currently have Topkin Maverick pair of framed challenge coins.
[00:19.130 --> 00:24.510]  I don't really know what a challenge coin is. I assume that they're for the purpose of challenging.
[00:24.990 --> 00:32.350]  But I don't know if there's a game like you drop a challenge coin and then do rock, paper, scissors or like a thumb war or game of tag.
[00:32.530 --> 00:35.190]  We're already moved on. Doesn't matter. I'll never get an answer to that question.
[00:35.190 --> 00:43.290]  We're at lot 1373. I believe that the tuxedo lot is 1399.
[00:43.530 --> 00:48.390]  So we have a little bit to go, but these have a tendency of moving pretty quickly.
[00:48.570 --> 00:54.270]  This is the thing on display. Total Recall 2012 Federal Police Rapid Response Unit Costume.
[00:55.690 --> 01:03.670]  Who would... I mean, it's a cool suit, but is there anybody... I don't think I've ever heard anyone be a fan of Total Recall, the 2012 version.
[01:04.130 --> 01:10.010]  Like, I've seen it. It's not the worst movie, but somebody must have a fandom for it.
[01:10.070 --> 01:14.990]  And I would love to meet that person because it's just so bland. It's just so average.
[01:16.070 --> 01:25.250]  It's like peak, top tier, mediocre Colin Farrell. And it's going for a lot. I don't understand. Also, the estimates don't...
[01:25.250 --> 01:32.450]  So when you do these auctions, at least on this website, they have an estimate, which is a minimum number and a higher end number.
[01:32.450 --> 01:35.870]  So this one is a minimum of $3,000 to a maximum of $5,000.
[01:36.730 --> 01:43.290]  They set a lower entry bid, but from what I've seen, you can only get the item if you hit their minimum estimate.
[01:43.530 --> 01:48.610]  So I'm curious how they set those. Is it based on some sort of market research?
[01:49.290 --> 01:52.810]  Or is it like what the person who's selling it is selling it?
[01:52.830 --> 01:57.990]  Because I don't think... I'm pretty sure this is just an auction house. I don't know how much of this they actually own.
[01:57.990 --> 02:02.310]  I'm pretty sure that they're just sort of like the middleman between people selling their collections.
[02:03.870 --> 02:07.170]  It'd be interesting to know how they acquire these pieces.
[02:08.490 --> 02:12.910]  That was fast. Nobody wanted the Colin Farrell Total Recall.
[02:13.530 --> 02:18.670]  Melina's stunt jacket from Total Recall 2012. Who the fuck is Melina?
[02:20.290 --> 02:24.990]  Jacket from Len Weissman's site. Oh, Len Weissman. What did he make? I think he did...
[02:26.330 --> 02:32.030]  Is he the Resident Evil guy? And he did Death Race, I want to say? This is moving fast.
[02:32.790 --> 02:37.930]  Chairs! The Fall Gravity Elevator Chairs. Still Total Recall 2012.
[02:38.310 --> 02:44.890]  They're really loading up with like the Banger movies. We're going from Total Recall to the Tuxedo, it seems.
[02:46.710 --> 02:53.530]  So I've essentially... we have a cap on how much I can spend. Or we as a show can spend. It's not my money, thankfully.
[02:54.430 --> 03:01.050]  On the Tuxedo Tux. And I've essentially hit the top bid that we can do.
[03:01.330 --> 03:09.070]  Because there is a 30% fee. It's like a charge that gets added to the auction. Whatever the bid is.
[03:09.970 --> 03:16.170]  I think we have a cap. I've hit essentially the highest point I can place where I'm comfortable doing it.
[03:16.570 --> 03:22.690]  I've been told strictly to not cross this cap. I've heard from other people on the show that like,
[03:22.690 --> 03:28.390]  if you go over we can cover it ourselves in some way. They're not here. I'm not comfortable making that choice.
[03:28.490 --> 03:33.870]  I'm just going to stick with what I was told. I am, however, optimistic by the fact that, sadly,
[03:35.130 --> 03:39.390]  the Tuxedo lot is at the essential end of this auction. So most of the stuff is gone.
[03:39.770 --> 03:46.630]  But the thing that follows the Tuxedo is a baseball uniform from the baseball scene in Twilight.
[03:47.190 --> 03:52.230]  I don't remember what character it is. It's not Bella or Edward. It's one of the Cullens.
[03:52.690 --> 03:55.070]  Which I think they're the only ones that wear the suit. So, anyway.
[03:55.670 --> 04:00.210]  If we miss out on the Tuxedo, I'm hoping to at least get that.
[04:00.890 --> 04:06.910]  And if neither of those go through, I've been told I can spend as long as I hit the cap. As long as I'm below that number.
[04:07.090 --> 04:14.270]  So, we might have to go into Friday and try to grab something on that day to surprise the guys with.
[04:15.410 --> 04:16.410]  Now $13.79.
[04:17.710 --> 04:22.430]  These can be tricky, too, because I don't know. Sometimes it's immediate. Sometimes it takes a while.
[04:26.510 --> 04:30.530]  Trick. The current thing is lot $13.79. Trick $20.19.
[04:31.430 --> 04:33.670]  Trick's Tom Niemann's hoodie and gloves.
[04:34.770 --> 04:36.930]  I don't think I know what Trick is.
[04:38.110 --> 04:42.190]  Is that the... no, that was called Trick or Treat. I don't know what Trick is.
[04:43.030 --> 04:53.470]  Tron lot $13.80. $19.82. Set of 12... 12 Caudalus? Caudalus? Caudal... Cauda... Caudal... Caudalus?
[04:53.910 --> 05:00.010]  And two image prints. It is unfortunate you cannot click the thing, so you can't zoom in.
[05:00.350 --> 05:04.050]  Ah, Tron Legacy. Blackguard's light cycle baton?
[05:05.010 --> 05:08.530]  Is that how they activated the light cycle things? Or is that like a baton?
[05:09.310 --> 05:10.430]  It's the description.
[05:12.430 --> 05:16.890]  Blackguard's light cycle baton from Joseph Kaczynski's sci-fi action sequel Tron Legacy.
[05:17.830 --> 05:22.490]  Directorial program clue. Geoff Bridges and his team of elite warriors used their baton...
[05:22.490 --> 05:27.290]  Ah, they did. To deploy light cycles as they battled fellow programs on the game grid.
[05:28.370 --> 05:30.410]  I wonder if that is a challenge coin scenario.
[05:31.470 --> 05:32.610]  Dropping your light cycle.
[05:33.350 --> 05:37.430]  For the Maverick... whatever. That sequel. Top Gun Maverick?
[05:37.830 --> 05:39.450]  I think that's what the second one is called.
[05:40.450 --> 05:45.990]  Oh, this is something that I wish was later on in the fucking thing. I would love to have this.
[05:46.130 --> 05:53.490]  Lot 1382. Tropic Thunder 2008. Al Pacino's Brandon T. Jackson booty sweat energy drink.
[05:53.830 --> 05:56.810]  What a fantastic, stupid prop to have.
[05:58.050 --> 06:05.010]  Tropic Thunder opened with all these fake commercials and Brandon T. Jackson plays like this rapper turned actor in the movie.
[06:05.170 --> 06:08.210]  And booty sweat is like the fake energy drink that he promoted.
[06:08.210 --> 06:13.930]  Having a real can or like the can from the thing in universe item, I think that's so cool.
[06:14.030 --> 06:17.150]  Those are the collectibles I enjoy as far as movie stuff goes.
[06:18.050 --> 06:19.350]  It's just so stupid.
[06:20.190 --> 06:25.610]  There's like four or five. So now it's another one. The Bustin' Up Bar, another Al Pacino's great product.
[06:26.290 --> 06:30.150]  Pop a cap and hunger. Energy bar, chocolate cocoa butter flavor.
[06:31.550 --> 06:35.370]  Fantastic. I'm so mad that this stuff isn't because it is...
[06:35.370 --> 06:39.750]  It's below the range by quite a bit. Like we definitely got one of these.
[06:40.850 --> 06:43.270]  And what a fucking cool thing to have.
[06:45.010 --> 06:49.590]  Next one is the Cody's Danny McBride's Tropic Thunder book.
[06:51.170 --> 06:57.870]  I don't think there's any images of what the inside looks like. I'm trying to remember. I haven't seen the movie since it came out, but...
[06:57.870 --> 07:04.650]  I think Nick Nolte's character in it, Nolte, wrote a book about his experience in the war.
[07:04.870 --> 07:10.650]  And that's what their in-movie movie called Tropic Thunder is based off of. I'm assuming it's that.
[07:11.970 --> 07:15.910]  Now we have Tropic Thunder, Kirk Lazarus's stunt shotgun.
[07:16.530 --> 07:18.990]  Weapons don't really do anything for me as far as props go.
[07:19.890 --> 07:24.930]  Currently it's expected to go for $2,500 at most, but it is above that at $2,750.
[07:31.480 --> 07:33.920]  Okay, we've moved on.
[07:34.860 --> 07:36.000]  Once again, Tropic Thunder.
[07:37.080 --> 07:42.160]  Twigman, Figure Award, and Lip Bomb. I don't remember that.
[07:42.240 --> 07:46.200]  I also don't remember Ben Stiller's character being called Tug Speedman.
[07:50.700 --> 07:54.160]  Twigman, Figure Award, and Lip Bomb from Stiller's action comedy Tropic Thunder.
[07:54.320 --> 07:59.360]  Speedman used his chapstick before mistakenly killing a panda he believed was a fiercer creature.
[08:00.100 --> 08:04.560]  Later he received a bowl and red cloth containing a wooden Oscar statue from his adopted son.
[08:06.840 --> 08:09.480]  Now we got Simple Jack on VHS.
[08:14.200 --> 08:18.060]  Filming, Dragon. I wonder what is on... if it comes with a tape or not.
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.240]  If it does, what is on that tape?
[08:23.280 --> 08:24.460]  We're getting close though.
[08:26.300 --> 08:29.220]  We're only like 12 away from the Tuxedo Lot.
[08:31.520 --> 08:33.060]  Oh boy, okay.
[08:35.980 --> 08:41.820]  The lot consists of a color-printed cardboard Simple Jack VHS cover affixed with an Oshie VHS video sticker.
[08:42.140 --> 08:43.020]  Ah, changed.
[08:44.460 --> 08:51.300]  Oh! You can get his best actor Oscar. I wonder... I assume...
[08:51.300 --> 08:53.340]  The award is made of... that's surprising, I thought it would be plastic.
[08:53.340 --> 09:02.760]  The award is made of metal designed to resemble a man holding an olive branch plated with gold and mounted to a black enameled base.
[09:03.760 --> 09:10.560]  The gold-colored plaque affixed to the base is blank and the enamel is flaking from production use exposing the metal underneath.
[09:12.260 --> 09:13.520]  Could have bought a fake Oscar.
[09:15.520 --> 09:16.840]  Oh, we're only 10 away!
[09:20.440 --> 09:21.840]  Best actor... envelope?
[09:23.380 --> 09:26.360]  I guess it's from when he won the award, is the current thing that's up.
[09:27.200 --> 09:33.340]  I wonder how much Tropic Thunder holds up. At the time I remember thinking it was very funny, but I haven't seen it in...
[09:34.460 --> 09:35.780]  Oh god, 14 years?
[09:37.660 --> 09:40.720]  Okay, we've moved away from Tropic Thunder, we're now on Troy.
[09:41.800 --> 09:44.940]  A movie that I wanted to like, but I just... sucked.
[09:48.940 --> 09:49.340]  2004...
[09:49.340 --> 09:55.420]  I just don't know what you do with a shield. Like, I guess... I don't know. What's it made out of?
[09:55.840 --> 09:59.940]  SFX, arrow strike, mirror, mitten, and shield from Wolfgang Peterson's mythical epic Troy.
[10:01.840 --> 10:08.340]  It's fiberglass. The fiberglass shield is plated black and we have swapped to more storyboards that I cannot make...
[10:09.720 --> 10:11.460]  make out what is happening.
[10:12.460 --> 10:15.620]  Oh! It says the...
[10:16.440 --> 10:18.060]  Menelaus? In Paris?
[10:19.340 --> 10:22.080]  Dual sequence? Menelaus? Menelaus?
[10:24.960 --> 10:26.760]  Ashbery hand-drawn pencil storyboards.
[10:28.100 --> 10:33.640]  Kinda looks like Eric Bana a little bit, but I don't think... I think he plays...
[10:33.640 --> 10:36.820]  Hector? In the movie? I believe that's his name.
[10:38.280 --> 10:42.320]  Another movie I haven't seen since probably 2005 or 2006.
[10:44.240 --> 10:50.340]  More storyboards! I wonder if you feel... if you buy one in the storyboard lots, like, whoever buys that, do they feel compelled...
[10:50.340 --> 10:56.880]  to buy this? Or is it like, I fucking love... this one is the arrival of Achilles. Like, is someone like, I fucking love that scene.
[10:57.240 --> 11:01.800]  It's my favorite scene in the movie. And they're all in on it. Or is it just like, you're getting a collection?
[11:02.720 --> 11:08.920]  And how many of these people are buying because they care about it? And how much of this is thinking that they can resell this later?
[11:08.920 --> 11:15.660]  I'd love to know how many items have gone through this store multiple times, but just different owners.
[11:16.060 --> 11:19.460]  Like, what is the most sold movie prop in history? Would be fascinating.
[11:19.920 --> 11:24.500]  True Blood! We're now moving back to... lesser things.
[11:25.180 --> 11:30.180]  I've never seen True Blood, I guess I shouldn't say that, but I feel like the consensus I hear is that it's not great.
[11:30.580 --> 11:34.200]  Or maybe it started out really good, and then it kinda lost its way?
[11:35.120 --> 11:37.080]  Haven't seen it, but...
[11:37.080 --> 11:41.760]  Bill Compton, Steve Moyer's Moon Goddess Emporium Assault Costume. That's a lot of words.
[11:42.820 --> 11:44.540]  Moon Goddess Emporium Assault Costume.
[11:44.900 --> 11:48.380]  It looks fucked up. Somebody paid a lot of money for a fucked up thing.
[11:48.580 --> 11:50.920]  Oh, that has fake blood on it! That's great.
[11:51.520 --> 11:54.540]  Louisiana Anti-Vampire Task Force Jacket.
[11:54.880 --> 12:00.120]  How do you join the Louisiana Anti-Vampire Task Force? Is that like a Facebook ad?
[12:00.120 --> 12:03.840]  Are you on Craigslist and you kinda join as a joke?
[12:04.380 --> 12:10.340]  Are vampires established in the True Blood world? Or is it like a secret thing?
[12:12.360 --> 12:16.460]  I don't think I'll ever watch True Blood, so I'll never know the answer to that.
[12:19.540 --> 12:24.560]  Ah! Tara Thornton's Rutina Wesley's Death Costume.
[12:25.160 --> 12:30.140]  I feel like that has to be something specific and not just a random spoiler.
[12:31.040 --> 12:34.500]  Although maybe I guess they could label it as the thing she died in, but that would be weird.
[12:35.080 --> 12:38.500]  True Blood Bottle. This feels like something that was made for Comic-Con.
[12:41.540 --> 12:45.800]  This bottle is labeled 100% true blood with blood type AB negative.
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.480]  I guess it was just used on set. It wasn't... that feels like a fucking... you're getting a lukewarm.
[12:51.480 --> 12:56.100]  We're so close to the tuxedo, I just realized. We're coming right up on it. We're two away.
[12:57.460 --> 13:00.780]  We're two away. I'm gonna turn on this guy's audio.
[13:01.920 --> 13:04.520]  When it gets to the tuxedo lot, we'll see what happens.
[13:07.280 --> 13:08.080]  Oh boy.
[13:11.700 --> 13:15.320]  One away at this point. 1398 Tucker, the man in his dream.
[13:15.460 --> 13:17.620]  I've never fucking heard of Tucker, the man in his dream.
[13:17.620 --> 13:22.100]  Set of four hand-drawn John Bell Tucker Sedan illustrations with PR.
[13:24.720 --> 13:28.520]  Current bid is below what the minimum is that they're hoping for.
[13:30.500 --> 13:33.740]  We're about to close. We're about to be on the tuxedo. We're about to be on the tuxedo.
[13:33.940 --> 13:37.940]  I'm putting the audio on because we're going to the tuxedo.
[13:41.870 --> 13:42.890]  We're at the tuxedo!
[13:47.250 --> 13:49.830]  Current bid. We are the highest bidder right now.
[13:50.390 --> 13:51.470]  Current bid is $2,000.
[13:53.230 --> 13:56.470]  The guy, the auctioneer, wants to wear the tuxedo. It's $2,000. We're the top bid.
[13:56.530 --> 14:00.750]  No interest so far. Holy shit. Nobody bid. Nobody bid.
[14:01.170 --> 14:04.250]  Nobody bid. Just hold off. Hold off. Nobody bid.
[14:05.230 --> 14:07.090]  It's about to close. We're about to get it. We're about to get it.
[14:07.530 --> 14:09.830]  Come on! Hold! Hold! Hold! Hold!
[14:10.610 --> 14:11.650]  Hold! Sell!
[14:12.970 --> 14:14.170]  SOLD! We got it!
[14:14.670 --> 14:17.090]  We got the tuxedo! From the tuxedo!
[14:18.470 --> 14:22.210]  Holy shit! That means we can't get the Twilight baseball costume.
[14:22.550 --> 14:26.250]  But who cares? We fucking got the tuxedo. Holy shit.
[14:27.230 --> 14:27.550]  Wow!
[14:30.050 --> 14:30.570]  Oh!
[14:32.510 --> 14:37.330]  Oh! The fucking... We never would have got the Twilight thing anyway. It's already up to $4,000.
[14:37.810 --> 14:40.750]  It just fucking flew. People love the baseball scene in Twilight.
[14:41.650 --> 14:43.230]  We got the... Oh my god.
[14:43.830 --> 14:48.190]  So I was told that I could spend to the cap. I still have some cap space.
[14:49.450 --> 14:54.410]  It might be tricky with shipping and everything. That might be... We might be as close as we can get to it.
[14:54.470 --> 14:58.330]  Because that was actually more with the percentage... I guess my math is off.
[14:59.150 --> 15:01.910]  Wow! We got it. Holy fuck.
[15:03.050 --> 15:06.170]  This is exciting. Now I'm going to have to go through this process.
[15:06.810 --> 15:10.990]  I can't wait to share with the guys. I don't know how this will exist, the thing that I just recorded.
[15:10.990 --> 15:13.450]  If it will come out the way it will. I have no idea.
[15:14.150 --> 15:15.790]  But if you're listening to this, I guess thank you.
[15:17.170 --> 15:20.190]  And I'm going to stop. Bye.
