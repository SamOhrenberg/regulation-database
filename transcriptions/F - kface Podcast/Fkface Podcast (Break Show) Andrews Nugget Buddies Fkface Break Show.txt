[00:13.340 --> 00:16.140]  Hello and welcome to another Ace Break Show.
[00:16.240 --> 00:16.980]  My name is Geoff Wams.
[00:19.440 --> 00:20.660]  You knew what you were going to say.
[00:26.060 --> 00:26.840]  You got me.
[00:28.160 --> 00:30.400]  Right before we started, Eric said,
[00:30.440 --> 00:31.000]  you know what you're going to say?
[00:31.100 --> 00:32.420]  Of course I know what I'm going to say, asshole.
[00:32.540 --> 00:33.340]  I've been doing this for 20 years.
[00:33.620 --> 00:34.340]  Don't screw it up.
[00:34.360 --> 00:35.500]  And I go, you're not going to get me.
[00:35.820 --> 00:37.160]  That's what I do that shit to Gus.
[00:37.320 --> 00:38.040]  That gets Gus.
[00:38.100 --> 00:38.700]  That doesn't get me.
[00:38.900 --> 00:39.680]  Geoff Wamsy, huh?
[00:39.680 --> 00:41.320]  Geoff Wamsy, yeah.
[00:41.900 --> 00:43.600]  Emily Hatfield, she's my wife.
[00:43.780 --> 00:43.860]  Hi.
[00:44.600 --> 00:45.080]  Currently.
[00:45.500 --> 00:47.680]  And then Eric Bedore, not my wife.
[00:50.660 --> 00:51.820]  Currently, and then my...
[00:52.220 --> 00:54.000]  You are my current and future wife.
[00:54.120 --> 00:54.580]  Yeah.
[00:55.260 --> 00:56.020]  My forever wife.
[00:56.080 --> 00:56.340]  Yeah.
[00:57.220 --> 00:57.620]  So far.
[00:58.000 --> 00:58.660]  What are we going to do today?
[01:01.080 --> 01:03.120]  Let's just move on from this part.
[01:03.180 --> 01:03.700]  You got it.
[01:04.060 --> 01:05.880]  We're going to stay happily married forever.
[01:06.080 --> 01:06.360]  Yay!
[01:06.720 --> 01:07.900]  We're going to love each other forever
[01:08.360 --> 01:09.520]  and respect each other.
[01:09.520 --> 01:09.960]  Uh-huh.
[01:10.180 --> 01:10.340]  Yeah.
[01:12.420 --> 01:13.900]  You know, Emily's got a podcast.
[01:14.380 --> 01:14.900]  I do.
[01:15.280 --> 01:16.820]  Now I feel like I got to dig myself out of the hole.
[01:16.920 --> 01:17.380]  Yeah, you better.
[01:17.540 --> 01:18.280]  Clutch My Pearls.
[01:18.300 --> 01:19.620]  Listen to it on the internet.
[01:19.720 --> 01:20.260]  What's it about?
[01:20.660 --> 01:23.320]  It's about the ladies listening to people fuck.
[01:23.520 --> 01:24.440]  Oh my God, no.
[01:24.580 --> 01:27.580]  It's a podcast about where I...
[01:27.580 --> 01:31.280]  My friends Barbara, who is Eric's small wife,
[01:31.340 --> 01:34.780]  and my friend Vanessa tell me about all the dirty little books that they read.
[01:34.900 --> 01:36.440]  Listening to people fuck?
[01:36.460 --> 01:37.360]  I don't know how that's any different from what I say.
[01:37.380 --> 01:39.060]  No, they read about people fuck.
[01:39.520 --> 01:42.480]  I was in my living room last night while they were giggling,
[01:42.700 --> 01:44.620]  talking about double vaginal penetration.
[01:44.780 --> 01:45.780]  Jesus Christ.
[01:45.920 --> 01:46.740]  Spoiler alert.
[01:47.440 --> 01:47.720]  Ugh.
[01:48.380 --> 01:49.840]  Anyway, Emily's learning how to edit.
[01:50.260 --> 01:50.940]  Yeah, we're learning.
[01:51.200 --> 01:53.740]  Yeah, so if we could please get some more listeners
[01:53.740 --> 01:55.900]  so that then we can hopefully get some sponsorships
[01:55.900 --> 01:57.700]  so that then we can hire a fucking editor
[01:57.700 --> 02:00.260]  because I don't know what we're doing and it's insane.
[02:00.460 --> 02:01.960]  Frustrating day in Premiere trying to...
[02:01.960 --> 02:02.120]  Ugh.
[02:02.400 --> 02:03.980]  Realizing I don't remember how Premiere works.
[02:04.080 --> 02:04.860]  But also...
[02:04.860 --> 02:05.140]  Clutch My Pearls pod.
[02:05.680 --> 02:06.180]  I'm sorry.
[02:06.180 --> 02:10.940]  But also today we're going to be opening Andrew Panton's Nugget Buddies.
[02:11.380 --> 02:11.940]  That's right.
[02:12.040 --> 02:14.380]  Are they PSA graded 10 Nugget Buddies?
[02:14.500 --> 02:18.860]  Will he get Kerwin and Darla to round out his collection?
[02:19.040 --> 02:23.040]  Only Geoff Whamsey knows as we open these Nugget Buddies.
[02:23.400 --> 02:24.700]  I hope we get a Darla.
[02:24.900 --> 02:26.300]  How many Nugget Buddies do we have to open?
[02:26.320 --> 02:27.040]  I think we have 14.
[02:27.420 --> 02:27.700]  What?
[02:28.600 --> 02:28.700]  Dang.
[02:28.700 --> 02:30.620]  So we'll get to it.
[02:30.720 --> 02:32.280]  It'll be the big reveal at the end.
[02:32.540 --> 02:34.580]  That way Andrew has to watch the entire breakdown.
[02:34.700 --> 02:34.760]  Yay!
[02:34.760 --> 02:35.800]  Because he doesn't know.
[02:35.820 --> 02:37.040]  We're going to cut in at some point.
[02:37.100 --> 02:37.520]  You don't know when.
[02:37.620 --> 02:40.340]  I'm going to ask him questions about what happened in the episode.
[02:40.620 --> 02:41.420]  That's going to be awesome.
[02:41.720 --> 02:42.920]  But before we do anything else.
[02:43.080 --> 02:43.280]  Do it.
[02:43.360 --> 02:44.440]  The very first thing we do.
[02:44.600 --> 02:48.300]  Each and every break show, we open up the pack sack.
[02:48.960 --> 02:49.900]  Take out a pack.
[02:50.140 --> 02:50.340]  Yep.
[02:50.900 --> 02:53.520]  And we see what fortune gives us today.
[02:53.920 --> 02:54.440]  Oh boy.
[02:54.520 --> 02:55.580]  It's our favorite.
[02:55.800 --> 02:57.260]  It's the Decision 92 card.
[02:57.340 --> 03:00.340]  As an election year, this is truly what we're all waiting for.
[03:00.460 --> 03:03.000]  Fingers crossed for a mint abortion rights.
[03:03.000 --> 03:04.140]  Oh my God.
[03:04.880 --> 03:06.560]  We still don't have those.
[03:07.520 --> 03:09.720]  Gay rights on card auto.
[03:10.360 --> 03:11.140]  Here we go.
[03:11.280 --> 03:12.960]  We have Ross Perot.
[03:13.740 --> 03:14.200]  God.
[03:16.300 --> 03:17.700]  This is great.
[03:18.240 --> 03:20.000]  Ross Perot's VP selection.
[03:20.100 --> 03:22.180]  I don't remember who that was.
[03:22.480 --> 03:23.140]  That wasn't who he selected.
[03:23.700 --> 03:26.020]  I thought he selected some like a military guy.
[03:26.100 --> 03:26.640]  Jean Kirkpatrick.
[03:26.800 --> 03:28.100]  I thought he selected like a military guy.
[03:28.100 --> 03:29.660]  He likes her bipartisan roots.
[03:29.820 --> 03:29.940]  What?
[03:30.400 --> 03:32.460]  She's a Humphrey Jackson Democrat.
[03:32.940 --> 03:33.740]  Who's that?
[03:36.080 --> 03:36.560]  Well...
[03:36.560 --> 03:36.960]  Next card.
[03:37.820 --> 03:39.100]  Harkin on the issues.
[03:39.600 --> 03:40.080]  Hey.
[03:40.340 --> 03:40.920]  Who's Harkin?
[03:41.300 --> 03:45.860]  I don't know, but I'm Harkin back to a more civilized time in politics.
[03:47.540 --> 03:48.500]  Self-announcement.
[03:49.060 --> 03:49.540]  Oh.
[03:51.180 --> 03:51.940]  Oh my God.
[03:51.960 --> 03:52.880]  That's on his hat.
[03:52.940 --> 03:54.380]  That's a cute ass hat though.
[03:54.460 --> 03:55.120]  Donkey's ass.
[03:55.280 --> 03:55.320]  Yep.
[03:56.920 --> 03:57.720]  Here's how you...
[03:57.720 --> 03:58.560]  There's America.
[03:58.800 --> 03:59.120]  Hey.
[03:59.240 --> 03:59.700]  I've been there.
[03:59.780 --> 04:00.340]  Take a screenshot.
[04:00.640 --> 04:01.720]  Do you think that you could...
[04:01.720 --> 04:05.880]  Do you think that you could like locate every state from memory?
[04:06.080 --> 04:06.280]  No.
[04:06.580 --> 04:06.880]  Fuck.
[04:07.400 --> 04:08.840]  The Northeast is fucked up.
[04:09.320 --> 04:11.320]  It was the 1960 election.
[04:12.780 --> 04:14.720]  Wasn't there a debate where one of them was real sick?
[04:15.280 --> 04:15.980]  Those two?
[04:16.220 --> 04:17.120]  I think that there was...
[04:17.120 --> 04:17.800]  There were...
[04:17.800 --> 04:18.780]  He wasn't sick.
[04:18.860 --> 04:20.640]  It was just that Nixon looked like shit.
[04:20.800 --> 04:20.980]  Yeah.
[04:21.000 --> 04:22.220]  And then they kept cutting to Kennedy.
[04:22.680 --> 04:26.140]  There was one that like someone had the flu during the...
[04:26.140 --> 04:27.040]  It might've been a bush.
[04:27.600 --> 04:28.200]  I don't know.
[04:29.020 --> 04:29.700]  There we go.
[04:29.700 --> 04:30.200]  I don't know.
[04:30.680 --> 04:32.580]  Dial D for democracy.
[04:32.920 --> 04:33.860]  That sucks.
[04:34.340 --> 04:35.400]  Former Soviet Union.
[04:35.540 --> 04:36.040]  There's Boris Yeltsin.
[04:36.040 --> 04:36.700]  All right.
[04:37.020 --> 04:37.700]  Good old...
[04:38.320 --> 04:41.740]  Speaking of that super attractive president, there he is again.
[04:41.820 --> 04:42.260]  Watergate.
[04:42.740 --> 04:43.900]  And then we have two.
[04:44.880 --> 04:45.580]  Oh, we got a...
[04:45.580 --> 04:46.080]  Oh, dude.
[04:46.140 --> 04:46.800]  We got a fucking...
[04:48.080 --> 04:50.520]  We got a...
[04:50.520 --> 04:51.040]  base.
[04:51.220 --> 04:51.460]  Yeah.
[04:52.200 --> 04:53.060]  Magic Johnson AIDS card.
[04:53.080 --> 04:53.340]  Yeah!
[04:54.780 --> 04:55.180]  Awesome.
[04:55.440 --> 04:57.640]  And then we got a green AIDS parallel.
[04:58.020 --> 04:58.060]  Whoa!
[04:58.060 --> 04:58.800]  Green parallel!
[04:59.320 --> 05:00.500]  Green AIDS parallel.
[05:00.740 --> 05:01.000]  Dang.
[05:01.000 --> 05:01.620]  We should put...
[05:01.620 --> 05:01.900]  We should...
[05:01.900 --> 05:03.120]  I mean, you're not going to get...
[05:03.120 --> 05:04.920]  That's a major issue.
[05:05.000 --> 05:05.780]  It's all fucked up, right?
[05:05.800 --> 05:06.500]  Yeah, but how many people...
[05:06.500 --> 05:07.480]  Yeah, but we're going to sleep at any rate.
[05:07.480 --> 05:09.060]  How many people have this card, though?
[05:09.060 --> 05:09.940]  Have the green AIDS parallel?
[05:10.380 --> 05:10.700]  Yeah.
[05:11.080 --> 05:12.360]  Fucking probably not many.
[05:12.460 --> 05:13.920]  That makes it valuable, right?
[05:14.020 --> 05:14.200]  Yeah.
[05:14.920 --> 05:16.520]  Wow, the pack cycle's pretty calm for us today.
[05:16.600 --> 05:17.040]  All right, hang on.
[05:17.400 --> 05:18.180]  Go back to the overhead.
[05:18.440 --> 05:18.620]  Yeah.
[05:19.660 --> 05:20.420]  Oh, hell yeah.
[05:20.540 --> 05:21.140]  Check out that hand.
[05:23.000 --> 05:24.340]  She's flipping us off!
[05:24.640 --> 05:25.980]  Oh my God!
[05:26.940 --> 05:27.300]  Dude!
[05:33.840 --> 05:35.080]  That's a whole new...
[05:35.080 --> 05:36.120]  Dude, this is in the collection.
[05:36.540 --> 05:37.420]  Yeah, that's in the collection.
[05:37.700 --> 05:38.360]  Speaking of the collection...
[05:38.360 --> 05:41.240]  I'm not sure who it was in the chat that pointed that out, but thank you very much.
[05:41.300 --> 05:41.860]  Thank you, chat.
[05:41.880 --> 05:42.260]  That was great.
[05:42.360 --> 05:43.080]  Jesus Christ.
[05:43.080 --> 05:43.640]  That was great.
[05:43.800 --> 05:48.940]  Speaking of the collection, we've been building this collection, doing a dogshit job of showing
[05:48.940 --> 05:52.060]  it to you, so I asked Gracie to buy a cabinet that we could start putting all the cards in.
[05:52.060 --> 05:52.920]  Oh, that's fun!
[05:53.360 --> 05:54.240]  So you can...
[05:54.240 --> 05:55.920]  There'll be a visualization of them at some point.
[05:56.020 --> 05:56.420]  That's exciting.
[05:56.700 --> 05:57.280]  Have you got some mail?
[05:58.740 --> 06:03.440]  Oh, there's a part, usually after I do the pack sack, before I do the mail, sometimes
[06:03.440 --> 06:06.440]  after the mail, usually before, where I go over the values from the previous week.
[06:06.440 --> 06:08.060]  Yeah, and we're still waiting for the cards to get back?
[06:08.400 --> 06:10.560]  Yeah, so we'll do that next week.
[06:10.940 --> 06:11.780]  It's not that I forgot.
[06:12.040 --> 06:12.340]  No.
[06:12.620 --> 06:13.620]  It's not that I forgot.
[06:13.700 --> 06:14.400]  Oh, there we go.
[06:14.580 --> 06:15.140]  Oh, what do we got?
[06:15.280 --> 06:16.340]  Happy New Year 2024.
[06:17.040 --> 06:19.140]  Fun fact, 2024 is the year of the dragon.
[06:21.180 --> 06:21.820]  Is that...
[06:21.820 --> 06:23.420]  Lunar New Year is February 10th this year.
[06:23.500 --> 06:25.340]  There's a Snoopy Peanuts card.
[06:26.100 --> 06:26.820]  And then...
[06:27.920 --> 06:29.460]  Oh, they're being dragons!
[06:30.320 --> 06:31.520]  Woodstock and Snoopy are being dragons.
[06:31.540 --> 06:32.300]  Look, Snoopy dragon.
[06:32.440 --> 06:32.760]  That's fun.
[06:32.880 --> 06:33.380]  That's the cutest.
[06:33.960 --> 06:35.380]  This person says...
[06:35.380 --> 06:36.680]  Very good handwriting, by the way.
[06:36.740 --> 06:37.000]  Nice.
[06:37.140 --> 06:37.680]  Hey, guys!
[06:37.860 --> 06:38.400]  Happy New Year!
[06:38.540 --> 06:40.520]  Regulation listener Kaya...
[06:40.880 --> 06:41.500]  Comment leaver.
[06:43.120 --> 06:43.480]  Akaomi...
[06:43.480 --> 06:43.940]  Letter writer.
[06:44.080 --> 06:45.140]  Or maybe that's Happy New Year.
[06:45.240 --> 06:45.440]  I see.
[06:46.920 --> 06:48.480]  Kaya, with some Japanese goodies for you.
[06:48.540 --> 06:48.920]  Thank you.
[06:49.020 --> 06:51.820]  To be honest, I have no idea if the cards are any good, so if they aren't...
[06:53.180 --> 06:53.800]  So, sorry.
[06:54.060 --> 06:55.120]  No, they're gonna be awesome.
[06:55.240 --> 06:55.920]  I haven't even looked at them yet.
[06:55.920 --> 06:56.720]  Or you're welcome if they are.
[06:56.800 --> 06:57.120]  Thank you.
[06:57.360 --> 06:59.920]  I've been living in Japan for about two years now, and...
[07:02.740 --> 07:03.520]  You turn it on?
[07:05.360 --> 07:06.520]  The battery just ran out.
[07:06.540 --> 07:07.040]  No way!
[07:07.340 --> 07:07.660]  Fuckface.
[07:08.020 --> 07:09.180]  We're going wild.
[07:09.780 --> 07:10.720]  Fuckface has a great...
[07:10.720 --> 07:12.040]  It's been a great concert for me the entire time.
[07:12.820 --> 07:13.140]  He's...
[07:13.140 --> 07:17.520]  It's scary leaving your home country for one that's unfamiliar, but at least I know every week I'll have something to laugh about.
[07:17.980 --> 07:22.060]  I'm visiting family in America right now, and my mom and I have really bonded over this show.
[07:22.180 --> 07:23.100]  So, thanks for that, too.
[07:23.560 --> 07:24.980]  Hope your 2024 is a great one.
[07:24.980 --> 07:26.220]  We got the mom demographic?
[07:26.600 --> 07:31.980]  Dude, it's because of our wholesome content like the Rocks Not Rocks draft or the Mall draft.
[07:32.160 --> 07:32.820]  Everybody loves that.
[07:33.120 --> 07:34.140]  Thank you so much, Kaya.
[07:34.200 --> 07:35.140]  I'm gonna keep this note.
[07:35.620 --> 07:36.540]  And then let's see what...
[07:36.540 --> 07:37.960]  And then these we'll put up on the wall.
[07:38.120 --> 07:38.860]  Battery's dead crazy.
[07:40.720 --> 07:41.520]  We'll put that there.
[07:41.620 --> 07:42.260]  Okay, what do we got?
[07:42.520 --> 07:45.800]  We got TOBS Japan Edition UEFA Cup.
[07:45.900 --> 07:46.300]  Oh, wow.
[07:46.480 --> 07:46.960]  Champions League.
[07:47.080 --> 07:47.640]  Oh, interesting.
[07:48.180 --> 07:50.880]  Oh, I just feel this pack feels good.
[07:50.960 --> 07:51.140]  Yeah?
[07:51.260 --> 07:51.720]  I'm gonna open this one.
[07:51.720 --> 07:52.060]  Let's do it.
[07:52.060 --> 07:53.000]  This is a good feeling pack.
[07:53.140 --> 07:53.840]  Okay, we got a good pack.
[07:53.960 --> 07:57.580]  All right, we're leaning on you, Eric, for all the soccer knowledge.
[07:57.660 --> 07:58.440]  That's not how this works.
[07:58.440 --> 07:59.740]  You're a season ticket kind of guy.
[07:59.960 --> 08:00.240]  No.
[08:00.560 --> 08:01.480]  Don't you have season tickets?
[08:01.600 --> 08:01.880]  Do you have season tickets?
[08:01.880 --> 08:02.560]  Yeah, not to this.
[08:02.860 --> 08:03.540]  To a soccer team?
[08:03.660 --> 08:03.840]  No.
[08:03.980 --> 08:04.560]  I don't either, do you?
[08:04.980 --> 08:05.300]  Yeah.
[08:05.480 --> 08:05.920]  Okay, you're good.
[08:05.940 --> 08:08.260]  Have you been to a soccer game other than like the one...
[08:08.260 --> 08:08.680]  The first...
[08:08.680 --> 08:08.940]  The one time?
[08:09.000 --> 08:09.780]  No, just the one.
[08:10.000 --> 08:10.460]  Have you?
[08:10.760 --> 08:12.960]  I found out what offsides is recently.
[08:14.440 --> 08:15.080]  Paolo Dybala.
[08:15.160 --> 08:15.420]  Uh-huh.
[08:15.980 --> 08:17.300]  Dang, that looks like Tom Sandoval.
[08:17.760 --> 08:19.380]  He plays for Juventus.
[08:19.500 --> 08:19.720]  Yep.
[08:21.040 --> 08:22.420]  You can tell by the way it says Jeep.
[08:24.680 --> 08:26.320]  Takumi Minamino, who plays for Liverpool.
[08:28.180 --> 08:29.520]  Would Gavin know who these people are?
[08:29.620 --> 08:29.860]  Yes.
[08:29.980 --> 08:30.460]  Some of them.
[08:31.480 --> 08:31.840]  Marquinhos...
[08:31.840 --> 08:32.340]  He has one name.
[08:32.340 --> 08:33.720]  ...plays for Paris Saint-Germain.
[08:33.920 --> 08:34.780]  Yeah, he's like a...
[08:34.780 --> 08:35.200]  Madonna.
[08:35.380 --> 08:35.620]  ...Oprah.
[08:37.420 --> 08:37.720]  Great examples.
[08:37.960 --> 08:41.700]  Julian Timber, he plays for AFC Ajax.
[08:42.400 --> 08:43.720]  Is that a...
[08:45.700 --> 08:46.580]  I don't know where that is.
[08:46.800 --> 08:47.400]  Amsterdam, it says.
[08:48.180 --> 08:50.620]  Fabio Vieira plays for El Porto.
[08:50.700 --> 08:50.900]  Okay.
[08:51.840 --> 08:53.380]  I know most of the teams, Elise.
[08:53.500 --> 08:54.000]  That's great.
[08:54.200 --> 08:54.320]  Yeah.
[08:54.540 --> 08:55.700]  Luka Sukic...
[08:55.700 --> 08:56.280]  Oh.
[08:56.900 --> 08:57.380]  ...Sukic...
[08:57.380 --> 08:57.960]  Oh, that.
[08:58.200 --> 08:59.160]  ...plays for Salzburg.
[08:59.180 --> 09:00.160]  He's in the Bundesliga.
[09:00.340 --> 09:02.500]  It looks like he's doing wizardry on the ball.
[09:04.300 --> 09:06.020]  Yeah, do we have a wizardry section?
[09:06.100 --> 09:07.860]  Ah, he's manipulating space again.
[09:08.300 --> 09:09.140]  I'll save that one.
[09:10.440 --> 09:10.920]  Tony...
[09:10.920 --> 09:11.240]  Gross.
[09:12.680 --> 09:14.120]  He plays for Real Madrid.
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.620]  Sidney Raybiger, he plays for Leipzig.
[09:19.040 --> 09:22.080]  Sergio Dest, he plays for FC Barcelona.
[09:22.280 --> 09:23.620]  That stands for Football Club Barcelona.
[09:23.620 --> 09:24.560]  Yeah, what's his name?
[09:25.140 --> 09:27.220]  His name is Sergino Dest.
[09:27.400 --> 09:27.460]  Ah, okay.
[09:27.760 --> 09:31.560]  And then Rafael Guerrero plays for Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga.
[09:31.740 --> 09:31.960]  Great.
[09:32.760 --> 09:37.040]  I was once office mates with a friend of mine who was a huge Borussia Dortmund fan.
[09:37.220 --> 09:40.500]  So I probably watched 50 Dortmund matches across two or three years.
[09:40.500 --> 09:41.500]  You had fucking Dortmania?
[09:41.860 --> 09:42.520]  I had Dortmania.
[09:42.780 --> 09:43.080]  Dude.
[09:43.080 --> 09:44.500]  They used to call me the Dortman.
[09:45.700 --> 09:47.140]  Let's open up one more pack, yeah.
[09:48.620 --> 09:49.620]  Brian Brawby.
[09:51.260 --> 09:52.260]  Nico Gonzalez.
[09:54.280 --> 09:55.280]  Stefan Tiggies.
[09:55.560 --> 09:56.960]  Most of these jerseys are not good.
[09:57.280 --> 09:57.480]  Koki.
[09:58.460 --> 09:58.960]  Koki.
[09:59.260 --> 10:01.040]  Look at that dude's fucking leg.
[10:01.160 --> 10:01.480]  Whoa.
[10:01.500 --> 10:02.000]  Boom.
[10:02.420 --> 10:03.660]  That's Serge Gnarby.
[10:03.760 --> 10:05.020]  That's like a rugby player's leg.
[10:05.440 --> 10:07.060]  That's Manuel Q.
[10:07.260 --> 10:08.200]  Yeah, look at his legs.
[10:08.280 --> 10:08.920]  He's a goalie.
[10:09.180 --> 10:09.740]  He's okay legs.
[10:10.220 --> 10:12.160]  Felix Mambimbi.
[10:14.480 --> 10:15.120]  Dusan Vlahovic.
[10:15.380 --> 10:16.080]  Whoa, he's a referee.
[10:17.080 --> 10:17.720]  Giorgio Scalavini.
[10:17.900 --> 10:18.920]  He plays on the blue team.
[10:19.260 --> 10:20.660]  And N'Golo Kante.
[10:20.900 --> 10:22.080]  He's on the even more blue team.
[10:22.700 --> 10:23.500]  He plays for Chelsea.
[10:24.920 --> 10:26.200]  Yeah, that's very cool.
[10:26.260 --> 10:26.780]  We'll save the rest.
[10:26.900 --> 10:27.840]  Well, first off, we gotta put one more in the sack.
[10:27.840 --> 10:28.840]  Oh, they gotta go in the pack sack.
[10:29.040 --> 10:30.460]  The pack sack immediately, of course.
[10:30.560 --> 10:30.680]  Yeah.
[10:30.960 --> 10:32.240]  Thank you so much for this, Kaya.
[10:32.400 --> 10:32.760]  Those are great.
[10:33.400 --> 10:34.820]  And for the lovely little New Year's Eve gifts.
[10:35.640 --> 10:36.100]  Ooh, that's a good one.
[10:36.100 --> 10:37.220]  That's the sack pack eating.
[10:37.220 --> 10:38.760]  One more piece of mail we got here.
[10:38.780 --> 10:38.980]  Okay.
[10:39.960 --> 10:40.280]  Oh.
[10:40.720 --> 10:41.920]  Oh my god!
[10:41.920 --> 10:43.140]  This is Mary Woofmas.
[10:43.960 --> 10:44.600]  Mary Woofmas?
[10:45.080 --> 10:46.720]  Hold it there so the camera can see.
[10:47.660 --> 10:48.140]  And then...
[10:48.140 --> 10:49.420]  Oh my gosh.
[10:49.500 --> 10:50.480]  Mary Woofmas.
[10:50.860 --> 10:51.700]  Look at that!
[10:51.940 --> 10:52.600]  Oh, wow, that's cool.
[10:53.280 --> 10:53.880]  That's great.
[10:54.160 --> 10:55.980]  That is the coolest Christmas card I've ever seen.
[10:56.380 --> 10:57.160]  Greetings from Canada.
[10:57.680 --> 10:58.280]  There you go.
[10:58.580 --> 10:59.140]  Canadians, man.
[10:59.160 --> 10:59.760]  They got style.
[11:00.280 --> 11:01.160]  Except for the one we know.
[11:01.420 --> 11:04.920]  I have to admit, I'm a bad Canadian, and I don't go to Tim Hortons very often, so by
[11:04.920 --> 11:07.420]  the time I realized they were selling NHL cards, I could only get a single pack.
[11:07.480 --> 11:09.040]  Anyways, thank you for all the laughs over the years.
[11:09.160 --> 11:11.900]  Next year, May 2024, is my 10-year RTE.
[11:12.740 --> 11:15.100]  Oh my god, thank you for 10 years of support.
[11:15.300 --> 11:15.500]  10 years.
[11:15.560 --> 11:16.740]  Don't you get a watch at 10 years?
[11:16.960 --> 11:17.800]  Yeah, you do.
[11:19.620 --> 11:21.420]  I hope you all had a good holiday season.
[11:21.560 --> 11:22.020]  We did.
[11:22.320 --> 11:23.720]  Well, I can't speak for you, but I did.
[11:24.040 --> 11:25.140]  Here's a magnet of my dog, Penny.
[11:25.140 --> 11:26.020]  Here's a magnet!
[11:26.520 --> 11:27.020]  Oh my god.
[11:27.780 --> 11:28.500]  Thank you.
[11:28.680 --> 11:29.480]  That's awesome.
[11:29.560 --> 11:30.800]  What do we have that's metal around here?
[11:30.980 --> 11:31.340]  This?
[11:31.580 --> 11:31.880]  Oh yeah.
[11:32.300 --> 11:32.800]  Now you can look at it.
[11:32.800 --> 11:33.540]  Oh my god, it works.
[11:34.060 --> 11:34.320]  Yes.
[11:34.480 --> 11:36.840]  Put Penny on the front, so you can see Penny.
[11:36.920 --> 11:37.180]  There you go.
[11:37.260 --> 11:37.500]  There you go.
[11:38.900 --> 11:39.500]  It's great.
[11:39.600 --> 11:41.880]  Thank you so much, and thank you for the video.
[11:41.880 --> 11:45.880]  And then this pack of Tim Hortons NHL trading cards.
[11:50.220 --> 11:53.980]  These are most fucking mother-cookie-ass cards.
[11:54.720 --> 11:55.500]  These are like, ugh.
[11:55.700 --> 11:58.020]  Yeah, but if you get a Bedard, right?
[11:58.140 --> 11:58.940]  You get a lot of money.
[12:00.040 --> 12:01.720]  Uh, Matty Beaners.
[12:01.880 --> 12:02.180]  Okay.
[12:02.340 --> 12:02.860]  Baneers.
[12:04.480 --> 12:05.600]  Then, uh...
[12:07.440 --> 12:10.040]  That's probably like some sort of a hockey boy band.
[12:10.160 --> 12:10.840]  You know...
[12:10.840 --> 12:14.940]  I mean, I think it's Triumphs.
[12:15.880 --> 12:16.980]  It's Hockey Triumphs.
[12:17.640 --> 12:18.240]  The words at the top.
[12:18.400 --> 12:19.780]  Trompes du Hockey is the band.
[12:20.420 --> 12:22.160]  And the lead singer is Josh Morrissey.
[12:22.240 --> 12:22.440]  Okay.
[12:23.080 --> 12:28.040]  The book that we read last night for our upcoming episode was about hockey players.
[12:28.360 --> 12:31.140]  And they're the ones that do two P's and the V.
[12:33.060 --> 12:35.600]  But they all kind of look like this when they play together.
[12:35.920 --> 12:37.880]  Oh, and we also learned there's a position called a grinder.
[12:38.960 --> 12:39.680]  Is that a thing?
[12:39.740 --> 12:40.400]  Is that a position?
[12:41.400 --> 12:42.720]  Save it for your show.
[12:42.740 --> 12:46.340]  He eventually grinded it, but these guys are really good teammates.
[12:46.520 --> 12:50.480]  Like, the hockey community, like, they really take care of each other.
[12:50.760 --> 12:50.980]  They're very giving.
[12:51.480 --> 12:52.640]  They're very giving.
[12:53.000 --> 12:54.100]  They're also very receiving.
[12:54.400 --> 12:55.880]  Yeah, so...
[12:55.880 --> 12:58.040]  Hey, do us a favor. Buy this shit.
[12:58.560 --> 12:58.780]  Yeah.
[12:59.860 --> 13:00.780]  We'll cut to it.
[13:02.960 --> 13:05.140]  This is the Sloppy Joe bingo kit.
[13:05.600 --> 13:06.720]  We ordered too many.
[13:06.920 --> 13:07.080]  Yeah.
[13:07.340 --> 13:09.820]  We'll be playing Sloppy Joe's bingo soon, too, I think.
[13:09.820 --> 13:11.060]  It's so much fun.
[13:11.120 --> 13:12.320]  It's the play-at-home kit.
[13:12.420 --> 13:13.300]  That's where you live.
[13:13.380 --> 13:14.080]  You live at home.
[13:14.400 --> 13:15.440]  This is perfect for you.
[13:15.560 --> 13:16.780]  You get this box.
[13:16.960 --> 13:18.320]  You pay a couple bucks for it.
[13:18.400 --> 13:20.380]  It's probably even on sale, usually.
[13:21.060 --> 13:21.940]  You get it home.
[13:22.020 --> 13:22.600]  You open it up.
[13:22.680 --> 13:23.540]  It's got daubers.
[13:23.860 --> 13:25.280]  It's got bingo boards.
[13:25.780 --> 13:27.040]  It's got, I think, a shirt.
[13:28.160 --> 13:28.880]  Fuck, dude.
[13:28.940 --> 13:29.640]  How do you go wrong?
[13:29.820 --> 13:30.160]  They got it all.
[13:30.440 --> 13:31.040]  It's got everything.
[13:31.180 --> 13:31.920]  It's got it all.
[13:32.040 --> 13:32.900]  It's a uniform production.
[13:33.960 --> 13:36.920]  And once we sell out, we can buy more dumb stuff.
[13:37.200 --> 13:37.320]  Yeah.
[13:37.440 --> 13:38.040]  Make more dumb stuff.
[13:38.040 --> 13:38.920]  And that's how that works.
[13:39.860 --> 13:41.740]  Speaking of dumb stuff, let's get to some...
[13:41.740 --> 13:43.040]  Yeah, let's do it.
[13:43.100 --> 13:43.800]  Oh, what's that?
[13:44.160 --> 13:44.480]  Oh.
[13:44.660 --> 13:45.920]  Here, you can have this one.
[13:46.460 --> 13:47.400]  Andrew had an idea.
[13:48.300 --> 13:49.000]  Has it been on?
[13:49.080 --> 13:49.580]  It's been on.
[13:49.620 --> 13:50.340]  I think so.
[13:50.440 --> 13:50.680]  The episode's come out.
[13:51.420 --> 13:55.520]  He said, you know how you put on a shirt, and it's like, oh, I put it on backwards.
[13:55.940 --> 13:58.660]  He said, what if there was no way to put it on backwards?
[13:58.920 --> 13:59.960]  It's all a front-front shirt.
[13:59.960 --> 14:09.220]  So, Ari, who works in our merch department, took two shirts, cut them in half, and he's
[14:09.220 --> 14:10.380]  made the front-front shirt.
[14:10.940 --> 14:12.620]  There are two fronts to this shirt.
[14:13.020 --> 14:15.840]  You can never put it on wrong.
[14:16.400 --> 14:17.860]  Unless you put it on inside out.
[14:18.180 --> 14:23.400]  Right, but there's another part to the front-front shirt is that there's a backpack shirt.
[14:23.860 --> 14:25.580]  So I have right here a backpack shirt.
[14:25.580 --> 14:31.140]  If you ever wanted the security of the back of a shirt on the front, if you ever wanted
[14:31.140 --> 14:34.380]  to say, I'm like a big crisscross fan.
[14:35.160 --> 14:40.760]  I want to Mac Daddy, I want to jump, but I always fuck up and put my shirt on the right
[14:40.760 --> 14:43.200]  way because that's just the way I've been doing it my whole life.
[14:43.480 --> 14:46.280]  You can get this, then you can always crisscross.
[14:47.020 --> 14:47.900]  You're going to put that on right now, right?
[14:47.900 --> 14:51.000]  I have so many layers on, but I'm going to put it on the front-front shirt.
[14:51.100 --> 14:51.500]  That's good.
[14:51.940 --> 14:52.620]  That looks good.
[14:52.620 --> 14:57.280]  So this is a regular shirt that you can wear.
[14:58.100 --> 14:59.400]  That looks so good.
[14:59.980 --> 15:01.520]  That looks so good.
[15:01.640 --> 15:03.340]  I wouldn't even know if it was the front or the back.
[15:03.680 --> 15:07.000]  It looks good when you have a sweatshirt and a jersey.
[15:07.440 --> 15:07.560]  Oh, don't worry.
[15:07.660 --> 15:11.580]  I'm also wearing a regular t-shirt underneath and then a sweatshirt and then a jersey and
[15:11.580 --> 15:12.720]  now my front-front shirt.
[15:12.940 --> 15:14.180]  And check out the back.
[15:14.300 --> 15:16.100]  It's also the front.
[15:16.400 --> 15:17.420]  Oh, wow.
[15:17.900 --> 15:19.740]  That looks so good.
[15:19.740 --> 15:24.020]  How convenient to have a shirt that's always the front of the shirt.
[15:24.100 --> 15:28.940]  I like that because you have the hoodie and the jersey and the other shirt, you look like a turtle.
[15:29.080 --> 15:35.380]  I was very layered up, sort of been smarter to wear when I wasn't wearing so many things.
[15:35.620 --> 15:39.540]  Yeah, but even with wearing so many things, it looks so good.
[15:39.600 --> 15:41.760]  Yeah, I'm pretty into the front-front.
[15:41.860 --> 15:48.540]  The backpack, I mean, it's cool and I was sold on it, but then I put on the front-front.
[15:49.300 --> 15:51.720]  So would you say you're more of a front-front than a backpack?
[15:52.000 --> 15:52.400]  Oh, definitely.
[15:52.920 --> 15:55.680]  So that's kind of like the new, like, if you're a front-front or you're a backpack.
[15:56.080 --> 15:56.640]  Yeah, or...
[15:56.640 --> 15:58.540]  That's kind of like the new...
[15:58.540 --> 16:00.920]  The new comment leaver regulation listener.
[16:01.580 --> 16:02.440]  Choose a side.
[16:02.760 --> 16:03.320]  Choose a Twix.
[16:03.400 --> 16:03.780]  Are you left?
[16:03.820 --> 16:05.560]  I was going to have you sleep.
[16:08.380 --> 16:10.520]  The attention deficit disorder has taken over.
[16:10.880 --> 16:12.860]  So now we have to open more packs of cards.
[16:13.000 --> 16:13.280]  Yeah.
[16:13.720 --> 16:15.060]  All right, so moving along.
[16:15.060 --> 16:16.200]  I am a disorder.
[16:17.340 --> 16:20.360]  We're just filling space until we get to the McNugget buddies, right?
[16:21.020 --> 16:23.320]  I was thinking, it's the NFL playoffs.
[16:23.520 --> 16:24.500]  We're getting pretty deep into the playoffs.
[16:25.660 --> 16:27.400]  NBA season's going strong, right?
[16:27.780 --> 16:29.180]  Hockey, going strong.
[16:29.240 --> 16:29.780]  Going strong.
[16:30.160 --> 16:32.120]  Let's open up some of last year's baseball cards.
[16:32.260 --> 16:33.260]  Yeah, let's do that.
[16:33.420 --> 16:33.600]  Yeah.
[16:34.040 --> 16:35.560]  You guys remember the Boys of Summer?
[16:35.660 --> 16:36.540]  Remember the Boys of Zimmer?
[16:36.800 --> 16:37.080]  Uh-huh.
[16:37.660 --> 16:40.060]  Well, we could take a little...
[16:40.700 --> 16:41.000]  Okay.
[16:41.340 --> 16:43.040]  You probably want to just use that blade one time.
[16:43.200 --> 16:43.580]  There you go.
[16:43.580 --> 16:45.080]  Damn, I thought I had...
[16:45.080 --> 16:50.140]  Anyway, I'm pretty sure this is a Box of Heritage hobby that I bought a year ago, maybe.
[16:50.500 --> 16:51.340]  These are 2022 cards.
[16:51.680 --> 16:52.600]  That I never opened.
[16:52.720 --> 16:55.220]  It's either that or it's like a mega box from the grocery store.
[16:55.360 --> 16:56.180]  Which would be dog shit.
[16:56.540 --> 16:58.320]  But these are going to be fun one way or the other.
[16:58.400 --> 16:59.640]  There might be one hidden here.
[16:59.760 --> 17:00.400]  There's probably not.
[17:00.540 --> 17:01.060]  We'll see.
[17:01.580 --> 17:02.520]  They're fun to open.
[17:02.620 --> 17:03.280]  People love them.
[17:03.420 --> 17:04.600]  I've never really gotten...
[17:04.600 --> 17:05.260]  People love these guys.
[17:05.260 --> 17:07.260]  I've never really gotten anything worth a shit out of them.
[17:07.340 --> 17:08.300]  We'll see if today's the day.
[17:08.400 --> 17:09.300]  Freddy Galvis.
[17:09.400 --> 17:09.640]  Okay.
[17:10.560 --> 17:11.280]  Patrick Corbin.
[17:11.460 --> 17:11.720]  Mm-hmm.
[17:11.720 --> 17:12.720]  Joey Gallo.
[17:14.520 --> 17:15.320]  Luis Robert.
[17:15.740 --> 17:16.080]  Lubob.
[17:16.300 --> 17:16.700]  Lubob.
[17:16.860 --> 17:17.960]  Luis Robert.
[17:18.140 --> 17:18.720]  Zach McKinstry.
[17:19.540 --> 17:19.680]  Mm-hmm.
[17:19.740 --> 17:21.000]  Rich Hoyle.
[17:21.940 --> 17:22.740]  Julio Urias.
[17:22.920 --> 17:23.060]  Oops.
[17:23.820 --> 17:24.620]  Edwin Diaz.
[17:24.880 --> 17:25.060]  Oops.
[17:25.060 --> 17:26.080]  Josh Harrison.
[17:26.500 --> 17:26.900]  Oops.
[17:27.100 --> 17:30.860]  Boy, you could just about field a Predator team of baseball players.
[17:30.980 --> 17:31.100]  Yep.
[17:31.560 --> 17:33.660]  Currently under investigation right now.
[17:33.680 --> 17:35.380]  You could, but we're not going to.
[17:35.460 --> 17:36.480]  That can be for you at home.
[17:36.640 --> 17:36.820]  Yeah.
[17:36.880 --> 17:37.860]  No, that's not something we'll do.
[17:37.920 --> 17:38.280]  I'm just saying.
[17:38.440 --> 17:39.000]  It's like, Christ.
[17:39.180 --> 17:39.600]  You could.
[17:40.380 --> 17:42.040]  Hall of Fame announcements tomorrow?
[17:42.460 --> 17:43.400]  Brandon Crawford.
[17:43.860 --> 17:44.080]  Hmm.
[17:44.280 --> 17:45.480]  Ian Anderson.
[17:46.240 --> 17:47.480]  O'Neal Cruz rookie.
[17:47.640 --> 17:48.720]  He's so tall.
[17:48.920 --> 17:49.520]  Max Fried.
[17:49.520 --> 17:49.740]  He is?
[17:49.760 --> 17:50.260]  O'Neal Cruz?
[17:50.420 --> 17:50.620]  Oh, yeah.
[17:50.720 --> 17:51.460]  How tall is he?
[17:51.560 --> 17:52.540]  6'7"?
[17:52.540 --> 17:52.640]  6'7"?
[17:52.640 --> 17:53.800]  Dang, he is 6'7".
[17:53.800 --> 17:53.940]  Yeah.
[17:55.320 --> 17:56.660]  Uh, Rugnett Odor.
[17:57.220 --> 17:57.660]  Rugnett.
[17:57.940 --> 17:58.380]  Rugnett.
[17:58.580 --> 17:59.020]  Rugnett.
[17:59.960 --> 18:00.840]  Rugnett Odor.
[18:01.200 --> 18:02.040]  He was a Padre for a minute.
[18:02.180 --> 18:02.920]  Rugnett Odor.
[18:03.000 --> 18:03.260]  Rug.
[18:03.380 --> 18:03.720]  Yep.
[18:04.560 --> 18:05.440]  Joey Wendel.
[18:07.040 --> 18:07.480]  Uh.
[18:08.960 --> 18:11.060]  These are kind of cool looking cards.
[18:11.140 --> 18:12.240]  They're kind of like throwback-y.
[18:12.500 --> 18:12.680]  Yeah.
[18:13.380 --> 18:14.140]  People like him.
[18:14.140 --> 18:16.520]  I like the little symbol on the corner of what their position is.
[18:16.720 --> 18:17.580]  Mike Trout.
[18:17.640 --> 18:18.620]  That's what you do in the outfield.
[18:18.660 --> 18:19.520]  He's good, right?
[18:19.620 --> 18:20.380]  T.J. Friedle.
[18:20.800 --> 18:21.000]  He is.
[18:21.000 --> 18:21.820]  Yeah, he was.
[18:22.020 --> 18:22.660]  What happened?
[18:22.860 --> 18:24.180]  He's hurt a lot.
[18:24.580 --> 18:26.500]  He's never been on a team that's done anything, so.
[18:27.320 --> 18:28.500]  Because he's been on Angels the whole time.
[18:28.640 --> 18:29.680]  And then this.
[18:30.140 --> 18:31.880]  Is he going to go to the Dodgers with everyone else?
[18:31.880 --> 18:32.120]  No.
[18:32.120 --> 18:32.500]  Oh, my God.
[18:32.500 --> 18:33.260]  That's one of the things.
[18:33.480 --> 18:33.840]  Yachty.
[18:33.840 --> 18:33.900]  Yachty.
[18:34.180 --> 18:37.900]  It says, find three exclusive chrome blue sparkle parallels inside.
[18:38.020 --> 18:38.380]  We did.
[18:38.480 --> 18:38.800]  There you go.
[18:38.980 --> 18:39.820]  You got Yachty.
[18:40.260 --> 18:40.700]  That's good.
[18:40.720 --> 18:41.360]  He's retired now.
[18:41.480 --> 18:42.160]  That was his last season.
[18:42.320 --> 18:43.000]  That was his last season.
[18:43.140 --> 18:44.100]  Lil Yachty, they call him.
[18:44.740 --> 18:45.960]  Yeah, that's what they called him.
[18:46.020 --> 18:46.840]  Yeah, that's his nickname, I believe.
[18:48.320 --> 18:49.260]  Let's see who else we get.
[18:49.380 --> 18:49.500]  Okay.
[18:51.620 --> 18:52.200]  That guy.
[18:53.320 --> 18:53.840]  That's nice.
[18:54.080 --> 18:54.600]  Yusei Kikuchi.
[18:54.760 --> 18:55.000]  Mm-hmm.
[18:55.220 --> 18:55.960]  Will Myers.
[18:56.240 --> 18:56.880]  El Gallo.
[18:57.020 --> 18:57.480]  All right.
[18:58.120 --> 18:58.760]  Jose Barrios.
[18:59.280 --> 18:59.700]  Oh, shoot.
[19:00.680 --> 19:01.320]  Anthony Alford.
[19:01.860 --> 19:02.360]  Double A.
[19:02.360 --> 19:03.460]  Mm-hmm.
[19:03.840 --> 19:04.640]  Hey, how are you?
[19:04.640 --> 19:04.780]  What's up?
[19:04.860 --> 19:05.300]  What's going on?
[19:05.700 --> 19:06.640]  He sucks.
[19:06.760 --> 19:08.140]  But you never hear Awesome Angelo anymore.
[19:08.280 --> 19:09.900]  He didn't make the jump to serious, I guess.
[19:11.320 --> 19:12.480]  Hernandez decides it.
[19:12.560 --> 19:13.380]  He decided it with a hit.
[19:13.500 --> 19:13.580]  Yeah.
[19:13.720 --> 19:14.640]  Abraham Toro.
[19:14.840 --> 19:15.200]  Mm-hmm.
[19:15.320 --> 19:21.080]  Do you guys remember 1973 when Brooks Robinson hit that home run in Arlington?
[19:21.660 --> 19:22.380]  Brian Reynolds.
[19:22.600 --> 19:23.400]  Christian Walker.
[19:25.320 --> 19:29.440]  That was cool that Gus was at the baseball game where Nolan Ryan got kicked out.
[19:29.620 --> 19:30.140]  He was.
[19:30.220 --> 19:30.600]  It was cool.
[19:32.380 --> 19:33.440]  I like your hat, Eric.
[19:33.520 --> 19:35.260]  You could also eat nachos out of that, huh?
[19:35.360 --> 19:35.520]  Yeah.
[19:35.660 --> 19:36.380]  Mitch Moreland.
[19:36.500 --> 19:37.880]  I just wanted to look like a third base coach.
[19:38.020 --> 19:38.700]  Yeah, it looks good.
[19:38.740 --> 19:40.420]  I got my jersey on, so I figured I'm ready.
[19:40.700 --> 19:40.760]  Yeah.
[19:40.880 --> 19:41.460]  G-Man Choi.
[19:41.740 --> 19:42.020]  Yeah!
[19:42.220 --> 19:43.180]  I'm a big G-Man Choi fan.
[19:43.460 --> 19:45.800]  When I first started to get back into baseball, it was that year.
[19:45.880 --> 19:48.360]  It was like, I think it was Tampa Bay and Dodgers.
[19:49.060 --> 19:49.200]  Mm-hmm.
[19:49.260 --> 19:52.120]  And I liked G-Man Choi so much, I went out and bought like 10 of his rookie cards.
[19:52.340 --> 19:52.500]  Oh, that's cool.
[19:52.560 --> 19:52.700]  Yeah.
[19:52.880 --> 19:54.260]  He was a Padre last season.
[19:54.580 --> 19:56.620]  Didn't get a hit for a very, very long time.
[19:56.680 --> 19:57.220]  That's too bad.
[19:57.320 --> 19:57.740]  He's terrible.
[19:57.740 --> 19:58.440]  I have like three of his autos.
[19:58.440 --> 19:59.640]  Josh Bell.
[19:59.960 --> 20:00.980]  Colton Wong.
[20:01.520 --> 20:02.820]  Tyler O'Neal.
[20:02.960 --> 20:03.140]  Uh-huh.
[20:03.740 --> 20:04.180]  Lordress.
[20:04.600 --> 20:05.160]  It's a Madonna song.
[20:05.180 --> 20:06.040]  Loudress Gurriel.
[20:06.400 --> 20:07.680]  Uh, DJ Lummi.
[20:08.660 --> 20:09.540]  Not Christ.
[20:09.820 --> 20:10.260]  What you got?
[20:10.480 --> 20:10.920]  Hey!
[20:11.340 --> 20:12.080]  What is it?
[20:12.220 --> 20:13.020]  Oh, I'm so excited.
[20:13.480 --> 20:14.100]  Hunter Renfro.
[20:14.240 --> 20:14.420]  Uh-huh.
[20:14.580 --> 20:18.560]  I got, uh, six weeks ago, this would have been a very expensive card.
[20:18.740 --> 20:19.000]  No!
[20:20.000 --> 20:20.200]  Hey!
[20:20.320 --> 20:21.240]  Is he a bad?
[20:21.680 --> 20:23.340]  Oh, it doesn't get much worse.
[20:23.380 --> 20:24.460]  It doesn't get worse.
[20:24.520 --> 20:26.580]  Is he the one that got in trouble?
[20:26.900 --> 20:27.620]  Oh, he's so...
[20:27.620 --> 20:28.300]  He's one of the...
[20:28.300 --> 20:29.940]  Oh, he's the one who got in the most trouble.
[20:30.080 --> 20:31.800]  He's in so much trouble.
[20:32.020 --> 20:32.700]  Oh, Wander Franco.
[20:32.920 --> 20:34.120]  Oh my God, don't say it.
[20:34.360 --> 20:35.700]  But what, the guy...
[20:35.700 --> 20:36.060]  He's the...
[20:36.060 --> 20:37.320]  This isn't the guy from the Dodgers, though.
[20:37.380 --> 20:37.680]  No.
[20:37.800 --> 20:44.400]  No, he's the guy from the Dominican Republic who got in trouble for his relationship with a 14-year-old.
[20:44.400 --> 20:45.060]  Oh, the underage.
[20:45.240 --> 20:45.500]  Yeah.
[20:46.040 --> 20:46.840]  Jake Berger.
[20:47.140 --> 20:47.500]  Oh my God.
[20:47.620 --> 20:48.180]  That's a lot of guys.
[20:48.260 --> 20:49.240]  Carlos Santana.
[20:49.400 --> 20:49.900]  Bryce Harper.
[20:49.920 --> 20:50.580]  Carlos Santana?
[20:50.800 --> 20:52.100]  That's cool that he's doing something.
[20:52.700 --> 20:53.100]  Rosario.
[20:53.260 --> 20:54.060]  He's multi-talented.
[20:54.600 --> 20:55.400]  Sterling Marta.
[20:55.580 --> 20:56.720]  We need to get that shredder.
[20:56.720 --> 20:58.180]  These are all career highlights of Bryce Harper.
[20:58.680 --> 20:59.240]  It's kind of cute.
[20:59.600 --> 21:00.520]  Baseball comic.
[21:00.660 --> 21:01.180]  Oh, that's fun.
[21:01.200 --> 21:01.940]  I've never seen that before.
[21:02.740 --> 21:03.520]  That's really cute.
[21:03.580 --> 21:04.460]  Just leave that.
[21:04.680 --> 21:07.340]  Is one of the highlights him getting hit in the back by Cole Hamels?
[21:07.500 --> 21:10.460]  At age 7, Bryce dominated 11-year-olds.
[21:11.340 --> 21:11.640]  Ew.
[21:11.640 --> 21:12.340]  He played...
[21:12.340 --> 21:13.860]  And he's like, I'm gonna dominate you.
[21:13.880 --> 21:14.920]  Save it for your show, Emily.
[21:14.960 --> 21:18.280]  He played at age 13 with fellow future MVP Chris Bryant.
[21:18.400 --> 21:18.600]  Yep.
[21:18.700 --> 21:21.500]  Before 7th grade, he was hitting 400-foot home runs.
[21:21.860 --> 21:24.180]  He was on the cover of Sports Illustrated at age 15.
[21:24.180 --> 21:30.340]  Fourth outfielder ever with 100 runs, 40 doubles, 35 home runs, and 100 RBIs.
[21:30.420 --> 21:31.620]  Got hit in the back by a pitch.
[21:31.680 --> 21:32.700]  By Cole Hamels.
[21:32.940 --> 21:33.280]  It was cool.
[21:33.380 --> 21:34.180]  Luis Torrens.
[21:34.260 --> 21:35.040]  Emmanuel Clase.
[21:35.140 --> 21:36.380]  Do you want me to run this?
[21:38.220 --> 21:38.620]  Just...
[21:40.770 --> 21:41.670]  No, it's just...
[21:42.570 --> 21:44.390]  I just don't know what to do with it.
[21:44.570 --> 21:45.290]  Just leave it over there.
[21:45.450 --> 21:45.670]  Okay.
[21:47.030 --> 21:47.650]  I don't know.
[21:47.690 --> 21:49.130]  It's something we have to figure out.
[21:49.330 --> 21:49.550]  Yeah.
[21:49.830 --> 21:50.430]  Jaron Duran.
[21:50.710 --> 21:51.590]  Max Kepler.
[21:51.810 --> 21:52.730]  Yadier Molina.
[21:52.950 --> 21:53.370]  I'll throw it out.
[21:53.430 --> 21:54.350]  Hey, that's the same one.
[21:54.350 --> 21:55.490]  Tyler Gilbert.
[21:55.490 --> 21:56.750]  Luis Castillo.
[21:57.670 --> 21:58.630]  Alex Verdugo.
[21:59.330 --> 22:00.290]  Ah, Lou Brock.
[22:00.970 --> 22:01.930]  Ryan Zimmerman.
[22:02.070 --> 22:02.770]  Jason Hayward.
[22:02.830 --> 22:03.790]  Let's open up one more pack.
[22:03.790 --> 22:04.290]  One more!
[22:05.670 --> 22:06.830]  And then we'll move on.
[22:06.830 --> 22:07.730]  Is Hayward still playing?
[22:08.010 --> 22:08.610]  He's still in the league?
[22:08.790 --> 22:09.330]  He's gotta be.
[22:10.530 --> 22:11.410]  It's been a long time.
[22:12.310 --> 22:13.270]  Jared Kalenic.
[22:13.370 --> 22:13.610]  Okay.
[22:15.190 --> 22:16.490]  Garrett Cole and the other guy.
[22:17.510 --> 22:18.470]  Rafael Devers.
[22:18.610 --> 22:19.270]  The other guy.
[22:19.550 --> 22:20.330]  That's the one we're not.
[22:20.370 --> 22:20.650]  Yes.
[22:21.210 --> 22:21.250]  Lamont Wade.
[22:21.410 --> 22:22.690]  Frank Schwindel.
[22:22.930 --> 22:23.130]  Uh-huh.
[22:25.070 --> 22:25.710]  Walter Johnson.
[22:25.870 --> 22:27.730]  All-time shutout leader.
[22:28.510 --> 22:29.090]  That's cool.
[22:29.170 --> 22:29.910]  Evan Longoria.
[22:31.330 --> 22:32.390]  And Mark Melancon.
[22:32.610 --> 22:34.830]  Is Evan Longoria related to Eva Longoria?
[22:35.130 --> 22:35.990]  Like, Eva and Evan?
[22:36.190 --> 22:36.910]  Mark Molanson.
[22:37.430 --> 22:38.410]  And no, I don't think so.
[22:38.590 --> 22:39.830]  It'd be funny if they were brother and sister.
[22:40.970 --> 22:41.650]  That's what I heard.
[22:42.250 --> 22:43.610]  Is that according to the rumors you're starting?
[22:43.830 --> 22:44.770]  Yeah, that's what I think it is.
[22:44.790 --> 22:45.890]  A lot of people around town are saying.
[22:46.030 --> 22:49.930]  Yeah, I mean, like, they grew up in San Antonio, and that's where I learned to play.
[22:50.290 --> 22:51.630]  Is that where she's from?
[22:51.930 --> 22:52.710]  Yeah, I think so.
[22:52.850 --> 22:53.830]  You guys wanna do some hotboxing?
[22:54.190 --> 22:56.150]  That's not what Charles Barkley says.
[23:00.050 --> 23:00.870]  Repeating what I heard.
[23:00.970 --> 23:01.730]  That's where Shaq went to high school.
[23:04.570 --> 23:05.730]  Shaq went to high school in San Antonio?
[23:05.990 --> 23:06.150]  Yeah.
[23:06.490 --> 23:07.350]  What are these?
[23:07.990 --> 23:09.470]  Some other shit I bought a long time ago.
[23:10.730 --> 23:11.370]  Disney Hotbox.
[23:11.950 --> 23:14.310]  Mickey and Friends Cheerful Times trading cards.
[23:14.330 --> 23:17.850]  I thought maybe it was gonna be something, like, Fisher was gonna be pumped for, but I don't think it's this.
[23:17.930 --> 23:18.450]  I bet it is.
[23:18.710 --> 23:19.670]  It's a hotbox, dude.
[23:19.670 --> 23:22.710]  This isn't, like, Magic the Gathering or whatever.
[23:22.710 --> 23:24.110]  Something that Jack would be into?
[23:24.530 --> 23:25.510]  Yeah, absolutely.
[23:25.750 --> 23:26.470]  Fuck if I know.
[23:27.630 --> 23:28.290]  Let's see.
[23:29.690 --> 23:30.630]  You alright, bud?
[23:31.030 --> 23:31.830]  Yeah, you good?
[23:33.050 --> 23:35.010]  What the fuck is going on?
[23:36.410 --> 23:37.110]  There we go.
[23:37.310 --> 23:38.210]  What the fuck?
[23:38.210 --> 23:38.750]  Weird to open.
[23:38.770 --> 23:40.550]  How are we supposed to open Nugget Buddies like this?
[23:40.610 --> 23:41.190]  This is weird.
[23:41.630 --> 23:42.570]  Okay, let's see what we got.
[23:42.650 --> 23:43.190]  Oh, shit.
[23:43.390 --> 23:44.090]  Look at all this stuff.
[23:44.170 --> 23:45.490]  We got a Donald Duck sticker.
[23:45.790 --> 23:47.110]  What is happening?
[23:47.530 --> 23:48.550]  What are these cards?
[23:48.550 --> 23:49.150]  I think it's from Japan.
[23:50.190 --> 23:51.710]  What the fuck?
[23:51.710 --> 23:53.030]  We got a Dewey.
[23:53.030 --> 23:55.110]  Mickey and Friends Dewey.
[23:56.370 --> 23:58.990]  Mickey and Friends Beep Beep the Atom.
[23:59.330 --> 23:59.470]  What?
[24:01.370 --> 24:02.250]  What's happening?
[24:02.450 --> 24:04.990]  And a Mickey Mouse Final Frame Collection.
[24:05.170 --> 24:06.350]  I can't read any of this.
[24:07.230 --> 24:08.710]  So I can't tell you anything.
[24:10.230 --> 24:12.090]  They're Cheerful Times trading cards.
[24:12.230 --> 24:12.730]  Oh, cool.
[24:13.090 --> 24:14.410]  I can't wait to trade these.
[24:14.590 --> 24:15.570]  These are really cool.
[24:15.850 --> 24:16.710]  Disney Hotbox.
[24:17.550 --> 24:18.370]  Is that really what it's called?
[24:18.370 --> 24:19.210]  Yeah, that's what it's called.
[24:19.210 --> 24:20.110]  It's a hotbox.
[24:20.110 --> 24:22.990]  Mickey and Friends Cheerful Times trading cards.
[24:22.990 --> 24:24.050]  Another Donald sticker.
[24:24.310 --> 24:26.430]  These Disney cards are going to make me late for homeroom.
[24:26.590 --> 24:27.150]  Oh, my gosh.
[24:27.630 --> 24:29.150]  The company is Kaka Wow.
[24:30.210 --> 24:30.890]  We have to.
[24:31.110 --> 24:31.670]  This is insane.
[24:32.010 --> 24:34.170]  This is Mickey and Friends Panchita Pistola.
[24:34.230 --> 24:35.870]  He's from Three Caballeros.
[24:36.130 --> 24:36.510]  That's fun.
[24:36.730 --> 24:37.550]  Here's a Pluto.
[24:37.910 --> 24:39.170]  Oh, and he's friends with the seal.
[24:40.190 --> 24:42.230]  These are really nice cards.
[24:42.350 --> 24:42.550]  Yeah.
[24:42.650 --> 24:43.450]  They're plastic.
[24:44.310 --> 24:46.030]  Oh, here's another Final Frame.
[24:46.150 --> 24:46.630]  Fatal Frame.
[24:46.910 --> 24:47.590]  Mickey and the Fatal Frame.
[24:47.610 --> 24:48.570]  Fatal Frame!
[24:48.570 --> 24:51.490]  He's got to take a photo of a ghost that's going to eat his soul.
[24:52.930 --> 24:53.810]  That's a video game.
[24:53.810 --> 24:56.070]  They should remake Fatal Frame with Mickey Mouse.
[24:56.510 --> 24:56.670]  They should.
[24:56.850 --> 24:57.210]  They should.
[24:57.890 --> 24:59.190]  Another Donald Duck sticker.
[24:59.290 --> 25:00.310]  I'm trying to develop a...
[25:00.310 --> 25:01.350]  I'm noticing a pattern here.
[25:01.730 --> 25:02.290]  And then we get...
[25:02.290 --> 25:03.970]  Oh, here's a Beagle Boys.
[25:04.250 --> 25:04.590]  Oh, yeah.
[25:04.930 --> 25:05.070]  That's cool.
[25:06.030 --> 25:08.050]  Oh, and we get a lenticular.
[25:08.370 --> 25:09.230]  Oh, look.
[25:09.230 --> 25:10.090]  They're being friends.
[25:10.370 --> 25:13.050]  Mickey and Minnie are about to do one of those Emily books she's always reading about.
[25:13.310 --> 25:13.650]  Kissing?
[25:13.850 --> 25:14.190]  Yeah.
[25:14.830 --> 25:15.310]  Kissing.
[25:16.270 --> 25:16.930]  And then...
[25:16.930 --> 25:17.650]  Must be hockey players.
[25:17.650 --> 25:19.490]  Another Final Frame.
[25:19.690 --> 25:23.350]  So this is kind of like the book we did of where it's like one girl and a bunch of dudes.
[25:23.750 --> 25:26.170]  And then like some of them watch and some of them don't.
[25:26.710 --> 25:27.250]  You know.
[25:27.750 --> 25:28.950]  This is their podcast.
[25:29.330 --> 25:29.530]  Gracie.
[25:29.890 --> 25:30.750]  Clutch My Pearls pod.
[25:30.950 --> 25:31.410]  Thank you.
[25:31.790 --> 25:32.650]  It's fucked up.
[25:33.290 --> 25:34.230]  It's your wife.
[25:34.350 --> 25:34.750]  I know!
[25:34.950 --> 25:35.670]  It's fucked up!
[25:36.850 --> 25:41.470]  Look, you can either read the books and listen and enjoy it or not read the books and then just find out what the books are.
[25:41.470 --> 25:42.430]  Or hide in your bedroom.
[25:45.170 --> 25:45.990]  Which is what I do.
[25:46.070 --> 25:47.570]  You hang out with little Binko in the...
[25:47.570 --> 25:48.510]  Yeah, little Binko.
[25:48.530 --> 25:51.750]  He hangs out with a dog and not keep... like doesn't keep him quiet.
[25:54.530 --> 25:55.610]  One time the dog...
[25:55.610 --> 25:56.290]  I know!
[25:56.650 --> 25:57.330]  Too many times.
[25:57.430 --> 25:59.210]  Last night the dog was a fucking angel because of me.
[25:59.410 --> 25:59.950]  He was.
[26:00.090 --> 26:01.310]  And because the Lions won.
[26:02.270 --> 26:03.270]  Is that why he was an angel?
[26:03.470 --> 26:04.410]  Yeah, he was in good mood.
[26:04.710 --> 26:05.650]  Alright, we're gonna open two more.
[26:06.750 --> 26:07.430]  He was in a good mood.
[26:07.510 --> 26:08.270]  The dog was in a good mood.
[26:08.470 --> 26:09.430]  That's why he was an angel.
[26:09.430 --> 26:15.410]  I also blew out the internet like in the middle of the game because I plugged in a space heater and Geoff was really mad.
[26:15.410 --> 26:19.350]  But then Barbara came over and she fixed it by having her magical present.
[26:19.390 --> 26:20.970]  It was down for over an hour.
[26:21.370 --> 26:23.530]  Yeah, Geoff was like, I'm trying to just watch it on my phone.
[26:24.090 --> 26:28.250]  I had to watch the fucking Lions game, second half of the Lions game on my phone.
[26:28.570 --> 26:33.810]  And then I just walked around wringing my hands like, I just plugged in a space heater, I didn't know it would do that.
[26:34.230 --> 26:34.910]  Well, don't plug it in.
[26:35.110 --> 26:36.710]  I'm sorry, I didn't know, it's cold.
[26:37.190 --> 26:37.470]  Nah.
[26:37.750 --> 26:38.470]  Our house sucks, alright?
[26:38.730 --> 26:39.330]  How about some gloves?
[26:39.650 --> 26:41.910]  Walt Disney's Olympic champ.
[26:42.030 --> 26:43.170]  Oh, it's about to be the Olympics again.
[26:43.170 --> 26:45.830]  And then, uh, Mickey Mouse Fatal Frame again.
[26:45.950 --> 26:46.230]  Cool.
[26:47.350 --> 26:48.310]  Same shit every time.
[26:48.330 --> 26:50.510]  These cards are, they're not bad.
[26:50.630 --> 26:50.950]  Yeah.
[26:51.070 --> 26:52.270]  But I wouldn't call them good.
[26:52.470 --> 26:52.810]  Yeah.
[26:53.030 --> 26:54.430]  I like this Donald Duck sticker.
[26:54.810 --> 26:55.830]  It's kind of like medium.
[26:55.990 --> 26:56.550]  Here's Huey.
[26:57.070 --> 26:57.530]  There he is.
[26:57.650 --> 26:59.910]  Here's, I can trade if...
[26:59.910 --> 27:04.390]  Oh, wow, Fisher, if you want to trade, we got two Ponchito Pistolas.
[27:04.490 --> 27:06.230]  And then there's a top hat and gloves.
[27:06.830 --> 27:08.130]  That one I'm not trading with you, Fisher.
[27:08.150 --> 27:08.450]  Yeah, no.
[27:08.610 --> 27:09.190]  That's ours.
[27:09.890 --> 27:12.470]  Okay, so we'll open up more hotbox down the road.
[27:13.190 --> 27:15.450]  Nerdtron JJ in the chat said,
[27:15.630 --> 27:19.190]  Clutch My Pearls and So Alright are both great podcasts.
[27:19.770 --> 27:20.570]  You should listen to both.
[27:20.810 --> 27:22.630]  Clutch My Pearls and So Alright, you know?
[27:22.890 --> 27:24.310]  And then listen to Face Jam, too, whatever.
[27:24.730 --> 27:25.670]  They're doing fine.
[27:26.490 --> 27:27.630]  Yeah, listen to Face Jam.
[27:27.730 --> 27:28.390]  But we're struggling.
[27:28.770 --> 27:29.910]  We don't know what we're doing.
[27:30.050 --> 27:30.850]  Here's a pack.
[27:31.130 --> 27:31.570]  Pirates.
[27:31.810 --> 27:33.650]  You know Gracie's never eaten at Applebee's?
[27:35.630 --> 27:36.170]  You dr...
[27:38.930 --> 27:40.230]  Well, yeah, of course.
[27:40.230 --> 27:43.510]  Who hasn't had a beer there or something?
[27:43.510 --> 27:43.690]  Oh, I drank there.
[27:44.010 --> 27:45.590]  I drank there, but I'm not gonna get the food.
[27:45.670 --> 27:47.210]  I'm getting fucked over by Applebee's.
[27:47.370 --> 27:49.210]  Have you been to Applebee's now?
[27:49.670 --> 27:50.170]  Still no?
[27:50.790 --> 27:51.070]  Tomorrow.
[27:51.330 --> 27:51.850]  Oh, shit.
[27:52.550 --> 27:52.750]  Yep.
[27:53.770 --> 27:54.570]  What do we got?
[27:55.050 --> 27:56.050]  What are these?
[27:56.090 --> 27:57.510]  You put this shit together and you make a game.
[27:57.770 --> 27:58.090]  What?
[27:58.970 --> 27:59.950]  The Pirates game.
[28:00.150 --> 28:00.610]  There you go.
[28:00.950 --> 28:01.830]  Is that what this is?
[28:02.390 --> 28:03.270]  No, this is...
[28:04.950 --> 28:06.330]  Is that the summoned pinhead?
[28:06.430 --> 28:08.630]  This was Blizzard shit.
[28:08.850 --> 28:09.210]  Oh, yeah.
[28:09.210 --> 28:10.950]  Fisher wants that.
[28:11.010 --> 28:11.950]  It was Blizzard shit.
[28:12.010 --> 28:13.530]  Tony wants a pinchetto.
[28:13.790 --> 28:15.050]  Or whatever his name was.
[28:15.550 --> 28:15.710]  What?
[28:16.190 --> 28:17.350]  Oh, Tony wants it?
[28:17.390 --> 28:17.490]  Yeah.
[28:17.730 --> 28:18.270]  Oh, here we go.
[28:18.350 --> 28:18.910]  Here's a fun one.
[28:19.590 --> 28:20.430]  Oh, what's this?
[28:20.690 --> 28:21.230]  Street Sharks.
[28:21.230 --> 28:21.510]  Oh, my God.
[28:21.610 --> 28:23.070]  He is so cute.
[28:23.410 --> 28:23.790]  Yeah, he is.
[28:24.990 --> 28:25.830]  Street Sharks?
[28:26.910 --> 28:27.690]  Like Card Sharks?
[28:27.710 --> 28:29.070]  Dude, you fucking love Street Sharks.
[28:29.170 --> 28:29.950]  I know it.
[28:29.950 --> 28:31.190]  Who doesn't love Street Sharks?
[28:31.350 --> 28:31.590]  Come on.
[28:32.390 --> 28:34.690]  Get a load of...
[28:35.610 --> 28:38.230]  Wasn't this the thing that Vin Diesel fucking did?
[28:38.230 --> 28:40.310]  He did a TV commercial thing where it's like,
[28:40.350 --> 28:40.930]  Yo, check it out.
[28:40.990 --> 28:41.590]  Street Sharks.
[28:41.810 --> 28:42.350]  Those guys.
[28:42.650 --> 28:43.750]  And then there's those guys.
[28:43.890 --> 28:44.770]  Yep, there's the Street Sharks.
[28:45.230 --> 28:46.270]  Oh, you guys...
[28:46.270 --> 28:46.690]  Check this out.
[28:47.630 --> 28:48.030]  Slapshot!
[28:48.150 --> 28:49.510]  They have shit on the back.
[28:49.570 --> 28:50.230]  That right there?
[28:50.330 --> 28:51.190]  That's one of the Street Sharks.
[28:51.510 --> 28:53.870]  Is Fishin' City finished?
[28:54.370 --> 28:54.830]  Oh, no.
[28:54.890 --> 28:56.030]  That's where the Street Sharks live.
[28:56.110 --> 28:57.970]  Was this like a Saturday morning cartoon thing?
[28:57.970 --> 28:58.190]  Yeah.
[28:58.950 --> 29:01.290]  That's, I think, one of the monsters the Street Sharks fight.
[29:02.790 --> 29:03.590]  Anybody hungry?
[29:03.990 --> 29:06.050]  That's all the Street Sharks before the Sharks.
[29:06.310 --> 29:06.650]  Is that true?
[29:06.650 --> 29:07.070]  Yes.
[29:07.730 --> 29:08.870]  Those are street people.
[29:11.270 --> 29:12.450]  Or those are people sharks.
[29:13.050 --> 29:13.890]  Those are people sharks.
[29:15.090 --> 29:15.410]  Ah!
[29:15.910 --> 29:16.390]  Come on.
[29:16.530 --> 29:17.330]  Fucking asshole.
[29:17.410 --> 29:19.130]  How are we supposed to get PSA rated 10 on these now?
[29:19.170 --> 29:19.470]  We're not.
[29:19.890 --> 29:20.110]  What?
[29:20.270 --> 29:21.330]  We blew it on our pack of Nolan Ryan.
[29:21.330 --> 29:21.790]  Oh, my God.
[29:21.790 --> 29:22.850]  What happened to these cars?
[29:22.870 --> 29:23.730]  Texas Express.
[29:23.930 --> 29:25.270]  Ew, what is going on?
[29:25.430 --> 29:26.070]  I don't know, man.
[29:26.210 --> 29:28.850]  Remember when, like, Ho-Hos or whatever came packaged in foil?
[29:28.990 --> 29:29.250]  It's that.
[29:29.330 --> 29:30.310]  Yeah, or like Kit Kats.
[29:30.330 --> 29:31.270]  That's exactly what it looked like.
[29:31.530 --> 29:34.430]  You know Kit Kat only came to, like, the U.S. in, like, the 90s or something?
[29:34.590 --> 29:35.550]  Like, it's like a new candy.
[29:35.550 --> 29:35.990]  Yeah.
[29:36.070 --> 29:37.610]  It only started, like, the 70s.
[29:37.650 --> 29:38.390]  Where was it based at?
[29:38.410 --> 29:38.690]  England.
[29:39.090 --> 29:39.490]  England.
[29:39.630 --> 29:40.050]  Weird, right?
[29:40.190 --> 29:40.890]  There's Nolan Ryan.
[29:42.690 --> 29:43.090]  Twix.
[29:43.270 --> 29:43.770]  Not Kit Kat.
[29:43.850 --> 29:44.230]  Twix.
[29:44.570 --> 29:44.970]  Oh!
[29:45.310 --> 29:46.030]  There's Nolan Ryan.
[29:46.830 --> 29:49.870]  Was it Twix brand or was it, like, the Cadbury brand?
[29:50.230 --> 29:51.950]  I mean, Hershey got...
[29:51.950 --> 29:53.750]  I think Hershey has the rights now or whatever.
[29:54.310 --> 29:54.490]  One of those.
[29:54.490 --> 29:55.390]  Yeah, I think it's Mars.
[29:55.490 --> 29:55.990]  Big candy.
[29:57.930 --> 29:58.510]  Nolan Ryan.
[29:58.670 --> 30:00.190]  These are all just Nolan Ryan cards?
[30:00.970 --> 30:01.370]  These...
[30:01.370 --> 30:01.670]  Nolan Ryan.
[30:01.670 --> 30:02.510]  These cards...
[30:02.510 --> 30:03.090]  Oh, shit!
[30:03.090 --> 30:04.150]  What happened to him there?
[30:04.210 --> 30:04.810]  Is that what he...
[30:04.810 --> 30:05.150]  What happened?
[30:05.310 --> 30:05.750]  Why is he bleeding?
[30:06.390 --> 30:06.930]  He got in a fight.
[30:07.310 --> 30:08.310]  He got in a fight with Nolan Ryan.
[30:09.230 --> 30:10.630]  He won and lost records.
[30:11.510 --> 30:14.430]  He wants to be remembered as a pitcher who did everything in his power to keep his team
[30:14.430 --> 30:14.710]  in the game.
[30:14.730 --> 30:15.310]  It doesn't really say.
[30:16.630 --> 30:17.470]  Here's Nolan Ryan.
[30:18.770 --> 30:19.470]  There's Nolan Ryan.
[30:19.950 --> 30:20.550]  That one?
[30:21.370 --> 30:24.090]  This is a picture from a card of Nolan Ryan.
[30:24.650 --> 30:25.750]  So that's Nolan Ryan.
[30:25.970 --> 30:26.150]  Yeah.
[30:26.390 --> 30:26.590]  Here's...
[30:26.590 --> 30:28.470]  Nolan Ryan is addressing the allegations.
[30:32.310 --> 30:35.410]  He's letting you know that he didn't know that that's...
[30:35.650 --> 30:37.250]  Oh, that's the Nolan Ryan.
[30:37.330 --> 30:37.950]  No, that's...
[30:37.950 --> 30:38.090]  Yeah.
[30:38.230 --> 30:39.650]  That's the Nolan Ryan.
[30:39.930 --> 30:40.490]  Nolan Ryan.
[30:40.630 --> 30:41.770]  One, two, three.
[30:41.790 --> 30:43.050]  That's the family that owns the...
[30:43.050 --> 30:44.430]  The Round Rock Express.
[30:44.570 --> 30:44.950]  There you go.
[30:44.990 --> 30:45.610]  One of those kids.
[30:45.730 --> 30:46.150]  Do they really?
[30:46.550 --> 30:48.290]  And there's Nolan Ryan.
[30:48.610 --> 30:48.850]  Okay.
[30:49.510 --> 30:50.150]  That's pretty cool.
[30:50.350 --> 30:51.030]  Where did those come from?
[30:51.050 --> 30:51.630]  Got some Nolan Ryan cards.
[30:51.630 --> 30:51.990]  Nolan Ryan.
[30:52.110 --> 30:52.890]  They're in the...
[30:53.250 --> 30:54.730]  They're in the box.
[30:55.390 --> 30:57.490]  Probably from somebody who probably mailed it in to us.
[30:57.850 --> 30:58.450]  It was very lovely.
[30:58.450 --> 30:59.550]  This one we have here.
[30:59.710 --> 31:00.530]  These are...
[31:00.530 --> 31:02.210]  Oh, pro cheerleaders.
[31:02.470 --> 31:02.810]  Oh, yeah.
[31:03.250 --> 31:04.890]  Saint Sations Dance Team.
[31:04.990 --> 31:06.110]  Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders.
[31:06.410 --> 31:07.550]  This is...
[31:07.550 --> 31:09.330]  Yeah, probably in the back.
[31:10.370 --> 31:10.910]  1992.
[31:11.390 --> 31:11.630]  Okay.
[31:12.990 --> 31:13.970]  Miami Dolphins.
[31:14.210 --> 31:15.670]  Maria Ciriello.
[31:15.950 --> 31:16.470]  Nice.
[31:16.870 --> 31:19.750]  Here's Lucretia Heidel for the Saints.
[31:20.090 --> 31:20.410]  Nice.
[31:20.670 --> 31:21.710]  Do they say what they are?
[31:21.790 --> 31:23.310]  Like the Saintettes or something?
[31:24.030 --> 31:25.030]  I think so.
[31:25.130 --> 31:26.010]  The Saint Sations.
[31:26.470 --> 31:26.750]  Nice.
[31:26.750 --> 31:28.210]  Here's the...
[31:28.210 --> 31:28.910]  Menina Aguabella.
[31:29.970 --> 31:31.030]  She's a Raiderette.
[31:31.110 --> 31:31.770]  Another Raiderette.
[31:31.890 --> 31:33.010]  Kathleen Luzarez.
[31:34.090 --> 31:36.090]  Here's Erika Patrice Spruill.
[31:36.270 --> 31:37.090]  She's a Saint Sation.
[31:37.190 --> 31:38.390]  I like their umbrella.
[31:38.750 --> 31:39.690]  Kelly Blunt.
[31:40.690 --> 31:41.370]  Hell, yeah.
[31:41.770 --> 31:42.590]  Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders.
[31:42.950 --> 31:43.790]  Lisa Rae.
[31:44.830 --> 31:45.390]  Raiderettes.
[31:46.710 --> 31:47.970]  I wonder if she's related to Martha Rae.
[31:48.070 --> 31:48.610]  Yeah, definitely.
[31:48.830 --> 31:50.130]  Rhonda Himalette.
[31:50.310 --> 31:51.370]  So it's just these three teams.
[31:51.670 --> 31:51.770]  Saint Sations.
[31:52.250 --> 31:53.530]  Alexandria Medina.
[31:53.830 --> 31:54.390]  Raiderette.
[31:54.430 --> 31:55.510]  Shannon Frazier.
[31:56.350 --> 31:56.710]  Nice.
[31:56.830 --> 31:58.470]  And then Anissa Zanning.
[31:58.590 --> 31:59.010]  There you go.
[31:59.230 --> 31:59.590]  Nice.
[31:59.710 --> 32:00.130]  All right.
[32:00.330 --> 32:00.770]  All right.
[32:00.830 --> 32:02.150]  If they have stats and stuff, they do.
[32:04.150 --> 32:06.350]  Like how many interceptions and stuff or what?
[32:06.550 --> 32:06.770]  Yeah.
[32:07.010 --> 32:10.050]  How many times I got blasted on the sidelines.
[32:10.610 --> 32:11.090]  Uh-oh.
[32:13.310 --> 32:14.350]  Should we open something else?
[32:14.510 --> 32:15.690]  What if we get to the Nuggies?
[32:15.850 --> 32:16.350]  You know what?
[32:16.430 --> 32:17.650]  I think we will open something else.
[32:18.070 --> 32:18.570]  We have to.
[32:18.670 --> 32:19.530]  We'll get to the Nuggets.
[32:19.550 --> 32:20.050]  Don't you worry.
[32:20.290 --> 32:20.710]  I'm just excited for it.
[32:20.730 --> 32:21.950]  I got a special one for you guys.
[32:22.110 --> 32:22.390]  What?
[32:22.410 --> 32:23.270]  You guys are going to love this.
[32:23.270 --> 32:23.570]  Yeah?
[32:23.630 --> 32:23.990]  Yeah.
[32:24.010 --> 32:24.150]  Okay.
[32:25.670 --> 32:26.750]  Is it this pack?
[32:26.750 --> 32:28.930]  I mean, eventually you're going to get it open.
[32:28.990 --> 32:29.350]  It's going to be cool.
[32:29.450 --> 32:29.610]  All right.
[32:29.630 --> 32:30.030]  What do we got?
[32:30.550 --> 32:31.850]  I have for you...
[32:33.090 --> 32:33.450]  Trolls.
[32:33.610 --> 32:33.970]  Oh.
[32:34.490 --> 32:35.150]  There's Dash.
[32:35.310 --> 32:36.230]  That's my little nephew.
[32:36.410 --> 32:36.830]  There he is.
[32:37.810 --> 32:38.170]  Slammer.
[32:38.370 --> 32:38.670]  Oh.
[32:38.850 --> 32:39.090]  Yeah.
[32:40.470 --> 32:40.830]  Jocko.
[32:40.970 --> 32:41.950]  Oh, Jocko.
[32:42.070 --> 32:42.710]  You're so crazy.
[32:43.090 --> 32:43.870]  He's just clowning around.
[32:43.990 --> 32:44.910]  Freddy Fibbler.
[32:45.170 --> 32:45.690]  Oh, Fibber.
[32:45.890 --> 32:46.090]  Sorry.
[32:46.230 --> 32:46.430]  Shit.
[32:46.590 --> 32:47.110]  He's a liar.
[32:47.450 --> 32:49.110]  He weighed at least 12 pounds.
[32:49.710 --> 32:51.730]  Oh, because he's lying about the fish that he caught.
[32:51.870 --> 32:53.190]  His personality is imaginative.
[32:53.190 --> 32:57.410]  His ambition is to catch a whopper.
[32:58.590 --> 32:59.310]  Favorite pastime?
[32:59.390 --> 33:00.030]  You guessed it.
[33:00.450 --> 33:03.790]  Freddy Fibber got his name from telling tales about how many fish he caught and how big
[33:03.790 --> 33:04.150]  they were.
[33:04.470 --> 33:09.670]  His latest story is that he caught a nine-pound, six-ounce bass last week, but the fish got
[33:09.670 --> 33:11.510]  off the hook just as he was bringing it into the boat.
[33:11.590 --> 33:12.630]  I hate these.
[33:12.730 --> 33:18.130]  When a troll asked how he knew how much he weighed, Freddy said, the fish had scales on
[33:18.130 --> 33:18.250]  them.
[33:18.490 --> 33:19.950]  I hate these.
[33:20.050 --> 33:20.430]  Oh, yeah.
[33:20.810 --> 33:21.950]  I don't like looking at them.
[33:21.990 --> 33:23.170]  I don't like what they tell me.
[33:24.690 --> 33:25.330]  Slick.
[33:25.450 --> 33:26.150]  Ski bum.
[33:27.090 --> 33:29.010]  Look out below.
[33:29.610 --> 33:30.850]  Let's learn about Slick.
[33:30.990 --> 33:31.290]  No.
[33:31.610 --> 33:33.650]  Slick, his ambition is to own a ski lodge.
[33:33.890 --> 33:35.430]  His personality is brave.
[33:35.630 --> 33:38.430]  His favorite pastime is chasing bunnies off the bunny slope.
[33:38.550 --> 33:39.990]  Oh, do you ski bunnies?
[33:40.270 --> 33:42.410]  Slick is a championship snow skier.
[33:42.530 --> 33:46.530]  He gives lessons at Broken Foot Ski Lodge in Brecken North.
[33:47.050 --> 33:51.850]  They just installed new North lifts this winter.
[33:52.310 --> 33:53.150]  He likes to race in the snow.
[33:53.150 --> 33:56.530]  He likes to race down the ski slopes at full speed while the other trolls cheer him on.
[33:56.630 --> 34:01.890]  He won three troll medals in the Nerfin Trolllympics a couple of years ago.
[34:01.930 --> 34:02.550]  He's very proud of that.
[34:02.710 --> 34:02.870]  Stop reading.
[34:02.870 --> 34:03.510]  That's really good.
[34:03.730 --> 34:04.790]  That's how he's so brave.
[34:05.610 --> 34:06.410]  Stop reading.
[34:06.810 --> 34:08.410]  Oh, rum-ba-da-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum.
[34:09.530 --> 34:12.730]  And then North Finland Elementary School.
[34:12.750 --> 34:13.750]  Oh, that's where they all went to school.
[34:13.830 --> 34:15.130]  Yeah, that's where they learned trolling.
[34:15.130 --> 34:17.490]  These cards are so fucking ugly.
[34:17.670 --> 34:18.810]  I hate these.
[34:18.810 --> 34:20.370]  Do you hate the cards or the trolls?
[34:20.630 --> 34:21.450]  Are you anti-troll?
[34:21.750 --> 34:22.230]  I don't...
[34:22.230 --> 34:23.130]  I didn't think I was anti-troll.
[34:23.130 --> 34:24.450]  I would say I am.
[34:24.590 --> 34:25.530]  They're gross looking.
[34:25.730 --> 34:29.750]  Somebody else said, hey, you didn't open up the pink box when I sent the mail last week.
[34:29.850 --> 34:30.450]  This is the pink box.
[34:30.590 --> 34:31.430]  There's good stuff in there.
[34:31.730 --> 34:32.210]  So, I'm going to open it.
[34:32.250 --> 34:34.970]  In the podcasts, they open up the pink box sometimes.
[34:36.170 --> 34:37.470]  Sometimes two of them at once.
[34:37.490 --> 34:37.910]  Oh, my God.
[34:38.390 --> 34:39.690]  I'm sorry about that one.
[34:41.910 --> 34:43.510]  Tops 2012 baseball.
[34:43.750 --> 34:44.370]  Holy shit.
[34:44.890 --> 34:45.290]  2012?
[34:45.870 --> 34:46.270]  2012.
[34:46.490 --> 34:47.530]  Who would have been 2012?
[34:48.570 --> 34:49.330]  Bryce Harper.
[34:53.010 --> 34:53.970]  When was...
[34:53.970 --> 34:54.770]  Yadier Molina.
[34:55.230 --> 34:56.090]  When was Mike Trout?
[34:56.670 --> 34:57.730]  Oh, it had to be right.
[34:58.730 --> 34:59.410]  Let's see.
[34:59.930 --> 35:00.230]  What do we got?
[35:00.510 --> 35:01.250]  Carlos Lee.
[35:01.430 --> 35:02.610]  There could be real money in here.
[35:03.090 --> 35:04.010]  Jorge La Rosa.
[35:04.810 --> 35:05.770]  Brandon Phillips.
[35:06.630 --> 35:07.030]  That's cool.
[35:07.610 --> 35:08.690]  This might be something.
[35:08.790 --> 35:09.490]  You Darvish rookie.
[35:09.770 --> 35:10.470]  Yeah, wow.
[35:10.610 --> 35:10.750]  Wow.
[35:10.750 --> 35:11.770]  You should definitely hang on to that.
[35:12.550 --> 35:15.730]  Here we have a Ryan Howard rousing rookie.
[35:15.850 --> 35:16.530]  Golden moments.
[35:17.330 --> 35:18.530]  Dude, do you remember Ryan Howard?
[35:18.610 --> 35:19.310]  Jesus Christ.
[35:19.310 --> 35:20.530]  Everybody loved him in the Phillies.
[35:21.630 --> 35:22.170]  Tops go.
[35:22.330 --> 35:23.810]  Unlock your chance for tops.
[35:23.990 --> 35:25.190]  I'm probably not going to win that now.
[35:25.290 --> 35:25.750]  You don't think so?
[35:25.810 --> 35:26.130]  I could try.
[35:26.810 --> 35:27.450]  Gordon Beckham.
[35:29.690 --> 35:30.330]  Alex White.
[35:31.670 --> 35:32.310]  Paul Mahome.
[35:33.010 --> 35:34.050]  And Randall Delgado.
[35:34.270 --> 35:35.030]  I mean, you Darvish...
[35:35.470 --> 35:37.170]  The You Darvish one might be pretty decent.
[35:37.430 --> 35:39.350]  Yeah, we should fucking probably send that off and get it.
[35:39.350 --> 35:41.390]  You probably want to put that in like a better sleeve.
[35:41.470 --> 35:44.110]  The You Darvish rookie, we probably want to put it in like a little bit of like a thicker
[35:44.110 --> 35:44.370]  one.
[35:44.510 --> 35:47.050]  So I shouldn't do to it what I did to this one?
[35:48.510 --> 35:49.290]  Well, we found out what happened.
[35:49.870 --> 35:51.630]  You know, you said you didn't want it.
[35:51.650 --> 35:51.910]  Yeah.
[35:52.030 --> 35:52.630]  He sucks.
[35:52.970 --> 35:54.950]  Okay, so should I put it in this big guy?
[35:55.230 --> 35:55.450]  I would.
[35:56.090 --> 35:57.390]  I would think so.
[35:58.010 --> 35:59.510]  It's maybe pretty decent.
[36:01.890 --> 36:02.870]  I mean, that's a...
[36:02.870 --> 36:03.330]  No, no, no, no, no.
[36:03.410 --> 36:03.730]  That's...
[36:03.730 --> 36:04.150]  No, you...
[36:04.150 --> 36:04.510]  That's...
[36:04.510 --> 36:04.970]  Don't do that.
[36:05.370 --> 36:05.990]  It's too big.
[36:06.550 --> 36:08.250]  It's just going to slide out and get damaged.
[36:08.530 --> 36:09.610]  We'll put it in a...
[36:09.610 --> 36:10.850]  It's just fine right here for right now.
[36:10.910 --> 36:12.870]  We'll put it in a correctly sized...
[36:12.870 --> 36:13.470]  What's his deal?
[36:13.590 --> 36:13.990]  I don't think we did that.
[36:14.070 --> 36:14.490]  You Darvish?
[36:14.610 --> 36:15.310]  Oh, he's a Padre now.
[36:15.470 --> 36:16.550]  But he's a...
[36:17.150 --> 36:18.130]  He's probably a Hall of Famer.
[36:18.270 --> 36:19.270]  He's like Nintendo up there.
[36:19.890 --> 36:21.070]  He's like Nintendo.
[36:21.630 --> 36:22.390]  Imagination duel.
[36:22.590 --> 36:23.370]  That's what these are.
[36:23.430 --> 36:23.630]  Okay.
[36:23.710 --> 36:24.190]  What do we got?
[36:25.250 --> 36:25.810]  We got some awesome ones.
[36:25.890 --> 36:26.690]  Fisher's going to want these.
[36:26.990 --> 36:27.390]  Avalon.
[36:27.650 --> 36:28.150]  Fog Bay.
[36:28.150 --> 36:28.730]  Just look at him.
[36:29.810 --> 36:30.210]  Paralit.
[36:30.990 --> 36:31.390]  Eclipse.
[36:32.690 --> 36:33.090]  Plith.
[36:33.170 --> 36:33.310]  Thermoblast.
[36:33.310 --> 36:35.490]  What's with the papyrus font at the top?
[36:35.850 --> 36:36.810]  Why is it papyrus font?
[36:36.850 --> 36:37.250]  Grow.
[36:37.610 --> 36:39.030]  It's because it's probably free.
[36:40.990 --> 36:41.790]  Fire Chogo.
[36:42.290 --> 36:42.690]  Careful.
[36:44.270 --> 36:45.330]  That's what they call me.
[36:45.670 --> 36:46.130]  Oh my God.
[36:46.290 --> 36:47.550]  That's when our dog's being...
[36:47.550 --> 36:48.010]  That feels intolerant.
[36:48.410 --> 36:48.730]  Burrow.
[36:49.630 --> 36:49.950]  Arbol.
[36:50.230 --> 36:51.310]  It's like a little tree.
[36:51.450 --> 36:51.790]  That's fine.
[36:52.690 --> 36:53.010]  Submerge.
[36:53.470 --> 36:54.210]  Okay, that's cool.
[36:54.270 --> 36:54.850]  That's what those were.
[36:55.710 --> 36:56.550]  Let's see what's next.
[36:57.110 --> 36:57.690]  More of those.
[36:57.730 --> 36:58.990]  Let's just put those in the pack sack.
[36:58.990 --> 36:59.590]  Oh, if you insist.
[36:59.890 --> 37:00.050]  That'll be fun.
[37:00.210 --> 37:01.490]  We always got to feed the pack sack.
[37:01.690 --> 37:01.830]  Yep.
[37:03.110 --> 37:03.430]  .hack//Enemy.
[37:03.610 --> 37:04.410]  We got two of these.
[37:04.430 --> 37:04.710]  Okay.
[37:04.870 --> 37:04.990]  Three of these.
[37:05.130 --> 37:05.590]  Four of these.
[37:05.710 --> 37:06.150]  Oh my God.
[37:07.550 --> 37:07.830]  Whatever.
[37:08.610 --> 37:09.850]  We'll open this one and this one.
[37:09.870 --> 37:10.810]  We'll put these in the pack sack.
[37:10.810 --> 37:11.050]  Okay.
[37:12.530 --> 37:13.170]  What's .hack//Enemy?
[37:13.510 --> 37:15.070]  .hack was an anime...
[37:15.070 --> 37:15.370]  Yeah.
[37:16.290 --> 37:16.610]  Cartoon...
[37:16.610 --> 37:17.090]  Is it a game?
[37:17.090 --> 37:18.850]  Game as well, probably.
[37:20.270 --> 37:22.730]  I'm not sure what came first, but...
[37:22.730 --> 37:23.310]  Let's do it.
[37:24.430 --> 37:24.910]  Arrowfish.
[37:25.390 --> 37:25.810]  These are games.
[37:27.270 --> 37:27.750]  Shinado.
[37:28.890 --> 37:29.370]  Guardian.
[37:30.130 --> 37:30.850]  Oh, this one's silver.
[37:31.110 --> 37:31.970]  This is a Martina.
[37:32.310 --> 37:34.030]  It's probably like a little Martina Navratilova.
[37:34.110 --> 37:35.150]  Yeah, that's what that is.
[37:36.170 --> 37:36.650]  Ectoplasm.
[37:37.170 --> 37:37.650]  Elk.
[37:38.590 --> 37:39.070]  Wormhide.
[37:39.530 --> 37:40.790]  It's the Mushroom King.
[37:40.990 --> 37:41.330]  Oh my God.
[37:42.450 --> 37:43.410]  General Armor.
[37:43.850 --> 37:44.630]  Heavy Metal.
[37:45.030 --> 37:46.130]  Cyclo-Shark.
[37:46.690 --> 37:47.070]  Is it real?
[37:47.070 --> 37:48.150]  These are really good graphics.
[37:49.470 --> 37:50.230]  They're like...
[37:50.230 --> 37:53.230]  I think that they had the same graphic designer as the General.
[37:53.410 --> 37:54.090]  Yeah, these are...
[37:54.090 --> 37:54.630]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[37:54.850 --> 37:55.550]  A hundred percent.
[37:55.970 --> 37:56.750]  Repth'Gamora.
[37:57.490 --> 37:58.010]  Bombay.
[37:58.770 --> 37:59.630]  Grand Armor.
[38:00.170 --> 38:01.070]  Oh, Thunder Armor.
[38:01.430 --> 38:03.130]  This is definitely a PlayStation 2-ass game, man.
[38:03.230 --> 38:04.030]  Mummy Kipper.
[38:04.770 --> 38:05.670]  Shield Man.
[38:07.170 --> 38:08.210]  Newt Necklace.
[38:08.470 --> 38:09.390]  Killer Snaker.
[38:14.010 --> 38:14.930]  I'm a killer.
[38:16.050 --> 38:17.050]  Why didn't that work?
[38:17.050 --> 38:20.390]  Why is that such a funny name?
[38:20.790 --> 38:22.730]  It looks so stupid, too.
[38:23.510 --> 38:25.210]  That is so fucking funny.
[38:25.370 --> 38:25.950]  I don't know why.
[38:26.150 --> 38:27.150]  I don't know why killer...
[38:27.150 --> 38:27.550]  I'm a killer.
[38:27.870 --> 38:29.490]  I'm a killer snaker.
[38:29.850 --> 38:30.270]  Killer snaker.
[38:33.030 --> 38:33.590]  Sword.
[38:34.390 --> 38:34.670]  Oh.
[38:34.810 --> 38:35.230]  Sword.
[38:36.070 --> 38:36.630]  Crest.
[38:37.170 --> 38:37.750]  Those are cool.
[38:38.310 --> 38:39.450]  Killer snaker.
[38:39.890 --> 38:42.350]  Okay, then we have this, which is a...
[38:42.350 --> 38:42.370]  What's this?
[38:42.670 --> 38:43.030]  I don't know.
[38:43.090 --> 38:43.450]  Let's see.
[38:45.190 --> 38:47.730]  Killer Snaker on card auto.
[38:48.390 --> 38:49.450]  This is a...
[38:50.690 --> 38:52.730]  From Crisis on Infinite Earths.
[38:52.730 --> 38:53.110]  Congratulations.
[38:53.790 --> 38:56.330]  This card was personally signed by Robert Wohl.
[38:56.470 --> 38:56.770]  Whoa.
[38:56.890 --> 38:57.130]  What?
[38:57.390 --> 38:57.590]  Whoa.
[38:58.630 --> 38:59.870]  From Arliss himself?
[38:59.970 --> 39:00.870]  It's Arliss?
[39:00.950 --> 39:02.150]  It's the Arliss?
[39:02.190 --> 39:04.610]  We got Arliss spelled with dollar signs?
[39:04.930 --> 39:05.810]  What's Arliss?
[39:05.950 --> 39:06.270]  Arliss!
[39:07.150 --> 39:08.490]  You don't remember Arliss on HBO?
[39:09.550 --> 39:11.290]  Oh my God, look at that.
[39:11.450 --> 39:12.070]  Arliss!
[39:12.930 --> 39:13.430]  That's awesome.
[39:14.430 --> 39:14.990]  Thank you.
[39:15.250 --> 39:15.570]  Wow.
[39:15.730 --> 39:16.250]  That's fun.
[39:19.810 --> 39:20.430]  Arliss hype.
[39:20.770 --> 39:21.850]  And then we got this little thing.
[39:21.930 --> 39:22.550]  It's all wrapped up.
[39:22.590 --> 39:23.330]  Let's see.
[39:23.370 --> 39:24.530]  You don't know what Arliss is?
[39:24.590 --> 39:25.250]  It's Arliss.
[39:25.490 --> 39:26.550]  Okay, cool, thanks.
[39:26.650 --> 39:27.370]  Thanks for the explanation.
[39:27.650 --> 39:28.110]  You don't know Arliss?
[39:28.250 --> 39:30.110]  You're too busy watching Entourage.
[39:30.230 --> 39:31.070]  You didn't watch Arliss?
[39:31.090 --> 39:32.150]  Was this on at the same time?
[39:32.330 --> 39:33.810]  I think Arliss was around that same time.
[39:33.810 --> 39:34.390]  Oh, here we go.
[39:34.450 --> 39:35.650]  It's Pedro Martinez.
[39:36.370 --> 39:36.950]  League leader.
[39:37.170 --> 39:39.390]  We'll put this for the Don Pedro project.
[39:39.490 --> 39:39.750]  Nice.
[39:39.970 --> 39:40.890]  These are a little beat up.
[39:40.970 --> 39:41.370]  This is fun.
[39:41.450 --> 39:43.210]  Scott Tyler, Geoff King.
[39:43.210 --> 39:44.650]  This is like someone's childhood collection.
[39:44.990 --> 39:45.710]  Luis Aquino.
[39:46.310 --> 39:47.110]  Here's Greg Anthony.
[39:47.590 --> 39:49.510]  We got ourselves Lance Blankenship.
[39:50.630 --> 39:51.950]  Vaughn Hayes.
[39:52.510 --> 39:53.570]  Haywood Workman.
[39:54.130 --> 39:55.290]  Dan Gladden.
[39:55.670 --> 39:56.490]  Kevin Roman.
[39:56.710 --> 39:57.490]  Some great names in here.
[39:57.570 --> 39:58.470]  Bobby Thigpen.
[39:58.830 --> 39:59.480]  George Brett.
[40:00.230 --> 40:01.510]  Paul O'Neill.
[40:01.810 --> 40:02.670]  Kyle Lowe.
[40:02.810 --> 40:03.460]  Michael Cooper.
[40:04.070 --> 40:04.970]  Bob Tewksbury.
[40:05.230 --> 40:05.790]  Tewks.
[40:06.010 --> 40:07.130]  Oliver Miller.
[40:07.910 --> 40:08.990]  Daryl Kyle.
[40:09.210 --> 40:10.170]  Bip Roberts.
[40:10.370 --> 40:10.710]  Yeah!
[40:11.130 --> 40:11.790]  Ben Howell.

[40:20.440 --> 40:21.000]  Ooh, here we go.
[40:21.060 --> 40:21.840]  Alvin Davis.
[40:22.100 --> 40:23.140]  Thank you for sending these in.
[40:25.000 --> 40:25.600]  Terry...
[40:25.600 --> 40:26.700]  Derry?
[40:27.380 --> 40:27.960]  What?
[40:29.780 --> 40:30.740]  Terry Derry?
[40:31.260 --> 40:32.300]  Terry Derry.
[40:32.840 --> 40:33.980]  That's really...
[40:33.980 --> 40:34.220]  Yeah.
[40:34.340 --> 40:34.620]  Yeah.
[40:34.860 --> 40:35.320]  Terry Derry.
[40:36.080 --> 40:37.200]  Geoff Blauser.
[40:37.400 --> 40:38.540]  Ryan Sandberg.
[40:39.820 --> 40:40.900]  Terry Tiffey.
[40:41.220 --> 40:42.060]  And Oil Can Boyd.
[40:42.060 --> 40:44.860]  I wonder if those were all carefully selected because they're all funny names.
[40:44.940 --> 40:45.800]  His name is Oil Can?
[40:46.260 --> 40:47.140]  Oil Can Boyd, yeah.
[40:47.240 --> 40:48.500]  He was a famous baseball player.
[40:48.580 --> 40:49.180]  Same as your dog.
[40:49.720 --> 40:50.980]  Yeah, same as Oil Can.
[40:51.500 --> 40:52.100]  You did it.
[40:52.180 --> 40:53.220]  You guessed his name.
[40:53.940 --> 40:56.900]  All right, let's take a palate cleanser from baseball for a minute.
[40:57.000 --> 40:58.440]  Almost heard his name the other day.
[40:58.480 --> 40:59.380]  Open up some basketball.
[40:59.640 --> 40:59.920]  Ooh.
[41:00.560 --> 41:02.540]  Pretty soon we'll be hopping into those...
[41:02.540 --> 41:05.840]  Ooh, those Golden Buddy McNuggets.
[41:07.140 --> 41:09.640]  Golden Buddy McNuggets is what they're called.
[41:10.140 --> 41:11.020]  Seth Curry.
[41:11.480 --> 41:11.860]  Cade.
[41:11.960 --> 41:12.500]  Base rookie.
[41:13.760 --> 41:14.080]  Is that good?
[41:14.300 --> 41:14.560]  Okay.
[41:14.900 --> 41:16.140]  Was worth something at some point.
[41:16.220 --> 41:16.400]  There you go.
[41:16.400 --> 41:16.720]  Take that.
[41:17.660 --> 41:18.540]  Shetty Oseman.
[41:19.060 --> 41:19.840]  Red Parallel.
[41:20.000 --> 41:21.140]  Red Wave Parallel.
[41:21.300 --> 41:21.460]  Okay.
[41:22.580 --> 41:23.840]  Nikolai Alexander Walker.
[41:24.760 --> 41:26.140]  You're a big Pistons guy, yeah?
[41:27.640 --> 41:29.320]  I mean, I like the Pistons, sure.
[41:29.680 --> 41:30.260]  Root for them.
[41:30.660 --> 41:35.900]  I mean, I think it might be clear that I'm a Boston Celtics boy.
[41:36.000 --> 41:36.360]  Oh, okay.
[41:38.740 --> 41:39.620]  Jesus Christ.
[41:39.620 --> 41:39.800]  Yeah.
[41:40.000 --> 41:41.180]  Shirt, hat, socks.
[41:41.180 --> 41:43.460]  I guess the Celtics have a game today.
[41:43.920 --> 41:44.660]  No, but it's green.
[41:44.920 --> 41:46.320]  It's a coffee shop, but it is green.
[41:46.900 --> 41:47.460]  Celtics Friday Night?
[41:47.600 --> 41:48.820]  Yeah, they play Dallas.
[41:49.500 --> 41:49.940]  Oh!
[41:50.200 --> 41:51.380]  They played in Houston last night.
[41:51.520 --> 41:52.640]  They're playing in Dallas tonight.
[41:53.460 --> 41:54.340]  Daniel Gafford.
[41:54.460 --> 41:54.880]  Paul Pierce.
[41:55.040 --> 41:55.640]  The Truth.
[41:55.920 --> 41:56.320]  Beep beep.
[41:56.400 --> 41:56.880]  Number 34.
[41:57.240 --> 41:57.840]  The Truth.
[41:58.220 --> 41:58.580]  There you go.
[41:59.120 --> 41:59.980]  Oh, nice.
[42:00.260 --> 42:01.960]  Silver Prism Magic Mountain.
[42:01.960 --> 42:02.140]  Oh, nice.
[42:02.280 --> 42:02.660]  That's cool.
[42:02.860 --> 42:06.040]  That'll go great with his green parallel.
[42:08.040 --> 42:10.120]  Paul Pierce the one with the podcast with KG?
[42:11.300 --> 42:12.420]  Do they have a podcast together?
[42:12.520 --> 42:12.980]  I think so.
[42:13.840 --> 42:14.780]  I don't know.
[42:15.040 --> 42:17.960]  I feel like it's mostly Paul Pierce saying stuff and then Kevin Garnett going,
[42:18.120 --> 42:18.960]  Man, shut up!
[42:20.300 --> 42:21.260]  Oh, shit, guys.
[42:21.620 --> 42:22.000]  Oh, shit.
[42:22.120 --> 42:22.240]  Cool.
[42:22.640 --> 42:24.080]  Joey Ingles.
[42:24.200 --> 42:25.260]  Isaiah Todd, bass rookie.
[42:25.860 --> 42:26.180]  Just leave that.
[42:27.200 --> 42:30.120]  Andre Drummond with a terrible print line on the top there.
[42:30.900 --> 42:32.260]  Not that it's worth a shit either way.
[42:32.260 --> 42:36.480]  And then an NBA 75th parallel.
[42:36.920 --> 42:37.900]  Danny Green.
[42:39.820 --> 42:40.840]  It's Danny Green.
[42:41.000 --> 42:41.120]  Yeah.
[42:41.280 --> 42:42.620]  Those are rare cards.
[42:42.920 --> 42:43.400]  Just leave that.
[42:43.880 --> 42:47.340]  Open up one of these and let's fucking just dive into some nuggie buddies.
[42:47.480 --> 42:48.460]  Is this this year?
[42:48.900 --> 42:51.580]  This is last year.
[42:51.680 --> 42:54.500]  Everybody let Andrew know that we're about to nugg.
[42:55.060 --> 42:56.160]  Andrew Wiggins.
[42:56.600 --> 42:57.000]  Miles McBride.
[42:57.000 --> 42:58.340]  Don't let him different Andrew.
[42:58.600 --> 42:59.000]  Oh, shit.
[42:59.060 --> 42:59.500]  Another silver.
[42:59.600 --> 43:00.340]  Charles Bassett rookie.
[43:00.340 --> 43:00.780]  That's cool.
[43:00.860 --> 43:02.240]  Boy, look at fucking...
[43:02.240 --> 43:03.680]  Look at how...
[43:03.680 --> 43:04.000]  Yeah.
[43:04.280 --> 43:04.980]  These are all real bad.
[43:05.920 --> 43:08.020]  Look at how bent that comes to you.
[43:08.160 --> 43:08.920]  That's awesome.
[43:10.780 --> 43:11.580]  I love it.
[43:12.600 --> 43:13.540]  Eric's gonna fall asleep.
[43:13.700 --> 43:14.420]  No, no.
[43:15.140 --> 43:16.700]  I'm excited to be here.
[43:17.220 --> 43:17.760]  Last pack.
[43:19.240 --> 43:20.200]  Last pack!
[43:20.640 --> 43:22.120]  Last pack mojo, as they say.
[43:23.520 --> 43:24.340]  There it is.
[43:24.660 --> 43:26.620]  I'm gonna say something funny about each one of these people.
[43:26.780 --> 43:27.580]  Okay, here we go.
[43:28.160 --> 43:28.700]  Here we go.
[43:28.900 --> 43:29.440]  Cuddy White.
[43:30.380 --> 43:30.920]  Go ahead.
[43:31.020 --> 43:31.820]  Here's something funny about him.
[43:31.900 --> 43:34.360]  He's playing very well this year on a bad team.
[43:34.720 --> 43:35.140]  Hilarious.
[43:35.240 --> 43:37.740]  He's been like the only bright spot on the team so far this year.
[43:37.840 --> 43:38.020]  What team?
[43:38.660 --> 43:39.400]  Chicago Bulls.
[43:39.520 --> 43:39.800]  Waka waka.
[43:39.820 --> 43:40.960]  Here's something funny about Jason Kidd.
[43:42.360 --> 43:44.600]  Two-time domestic assault.
[43:44.660 --> 43:45.720]  Oh my god.
[43:46.200 --> 43:46.600]  Really?
[43:47.000 --> 43:47.680]  Yeah, I believe so.
[43:47.720 --> 43:47.880]  Holy shit.
[43:48.620 --> 43:50.060]  He got arrested for domestic assault.
[43:50.060 --> 43:50.560]  Same person?
[43:50.840 --> 43:51.360]  Oh, fuck.
[43:51.420 --> 43:51.920]  Waka waka.
[43:52.500 --> 43:53.340]  Waka waka.
[43:53.760 --> 43:55.000]  Here's something funny about Donovan Mitchell.
[43:55.280 --> 43:56.760]  His nickname is called Spider.
[43:57.200 --> 43:57.400]  Why?
[43:57.400 --> 44:01.000]  People say he doesn't want to play in Utah, but he would...
[44:01.000 --> 44:01.860]  Well, he's not in Utah anymore.
[44:01.960 --> 44:03.360]  He plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers now.
[44:03.720 --> 44:05.300]  And it's not working out.
[44:05.320 --> 44:09.560]  Even though he's very good, him and Darius Garland, they're just not playing well together.
[44:09.900 --> 44:11.740]  And Darius is a couple years younger and cheaper.
[44:11.900 --> 44:16.360]  And so I think that they're gonna move Donovan Mitchell and probably get a haul for him in the offseason.
[44:16.460 --> 44:16.940]  Isn't that funny?
[44:17.200 --> 44:17.760]  Waka waka.
[44:18.980 --> 44:19.540]  Last one.
[44:19.600 --> 44:21.240]  We got another 75th NBA parallel.
[44:21.240 --> 44:22.320]  This one's actually pretty nice.
[44:22.420 --> 44:24.120]  This is White Chocolate himself.
[44:24.980 --> 44:26.700]  This is Jason Williams.
[44:27.660 --> 44:29.060]  Played for the Sacramento Kings.
[44:29.200 --> 44:30.180]  One of the best passers.
[44:30.620 --> 44:33.660]  Probably the flashiest passer in the history of the NFL.
[44:34.040 --> 44:35.100]  Definitely one of the best passers.
[44:35.320 --> 44:38.320]  Not a lot of great passers in the NFL the way that Jason Williams is.
[44:38.580 --> 44:39.800]  And isn't that funny?
[44:40.160 --> 44:40.780]  Waka waka.
[44:42.180 --> 44:42.840]  There you go.
[44:42.880 --> 44:44.780]  There's some funny facts about those guys.
[44:44.800 --> 44:45.160]  Waka waka.
[44:48.820 --> 44:52.000]  But now, without further ado...
[44:52.000 --> 44:53.300]  Do I look like AJ Perzinski?
[44:54.260 --> 44:55.440]  Well, you're not getting punched by me.
[44:55.440 --> 44:58.260]  Is that the Nobel hat?
[44:58.480 --> 45:00.060]  No, it's just the backwards one.
[45:00.320 --> 45:01.000]  AJ Perzinski.
[45:01.200 --> 45:03.180]  Andrew messaged me at 4.36.
[45:03.280 --> 45:04.300]  Get to the nugget, buddy.
[45:07.880 --> 45:11.560]  Andrew, that's not how this show works.
[45:11.640 --> 45:12.800]  Is Andrew in the chat?
[45:13.040 --> 45:13.460]  I don't know.
[45:13.540 --> 45:14.160]  He slacked me.
[45:16.240 --> 45:19.660]  Gracie also messaged our other slack that she has the final grip strength results.
[45:21.460 --> 45:22.880]  Oh, when do we announce those?
[45:23.560 --> 45:24.640]  Probably on the show on Thursday.
[45:24.640 --> 45:25.120]  Okay.
[45:25.140 --> 45:25.780]  When we record.
[45:27.160 --> 45:28.040]  I would think.
[45:30.020 --> 45:30.460]  Yeah.
[45:30.940 --> 45:31.800]  Oh, yeah, the crouton.
[45:33.780 --> 45:35.880]  What a fucking day we had on Friday.
[45:35.980 --> 45:40.140]  We can't fucking spoil anything that happened on Friday, but we filmed four videos.
[45:40.360 --> 45:41.780]  What a fucking day.
[45:42.060 --> 45:42.640]  Four supplementals.
[45:42.840 --> 45:43.780]  Oh, my God.
[45:43.920 --> 45:45.780]  Gracie and I definitely had the crouton.
[45:46.800 --> 45:47.600]  And I made the crown.
[45:47.800 --> 45:48.680]  It was wild.
[45:49.560 --> 45:50.380]  It's so good.
[45:50.480 --> 45:51.580]  We made sandwiches in the dark.
[45:51.640 --> 45:51.860]  Yep.
[45:51.860 --> 45:55.860]  We balded a melon and we made pies.
[45:56.020 --> 45:56.560]  We made pies.
[45:56.900 --> 45:57.460]  Yeah, we made pies.
[45:57.880 --> 45:58.060]  All right.
[45:58.080 --> 45:58.960]  Are we ready to get into this?
[45:59.060 --> 45:59.580]  Let's nug it.
[45:59.660 --> 46:00.320]  Let's nug up.
[46:00.680 --> 46:00.700]  Wait, wait.
[46:00.720 --> 46:03.400]  Why would you put them all there when that's where the camera goes?
[46:04.260 --> 46:05.460]  Just to show off I'm in either.
[46:06.840 --> 46:07.400]  Here we go.
[46:07.500 --> 46:07.860]  It's right here.
[46:07.920 --> 46:09.360]  It's going to make a wall between us.
[46:09.520 --> 46:10.400]  Can you collect them all?
[46:10.460 --> 46:11.560]  We're looking for...
[46:11.560 --> 46:11.680]  Finally.
[46:12.200 --> 46:20.080]  Now, Andrew already has Wafutu, he has Brick, he has Don Bernice, and he has Uptown Moe.
[46:20.080 --> 46:22.460]  He's just looking for Darla and Kerwin Frost.
[46:22.620 --> 46:25.920]  I actually have all six at home except for the rare golden nugget.
[46:26.060 --> 46:26.480]  I don't have that one.
[46:27.120 --> 46:30.160]  But we're just going to try to build a full set since we have so many.
[46:30.180 --> 46:32.480]  Should I call Andrew and we like know?
[46:32.820 --> 46:33.460]  Or what do you want to do?
[46:33.460 --> 46:34.080]  Is he watching?
[46:34.340 --> 46:34.940]  I don't know.
[46:37.040 --> 46:38.480]  Andrew, let us know.
[46:38.680 --> 46:39.560]  First card we have.
[46:40.360 --> 46:41.760]  Okay, so this is going to be...
[46:41.760 --> 46:42.340]  Okay, here we go.
[46:43.620 --> 46:45.780]  Darla, Kerwin Frost is what we're looking for.
[46:49.700 --> 46:51.040]  And it is...
[46:52.380 --> 46:52.860]  Uptown Moe!
[46:53.660 --> 46:54.140]  There you go.
[46:54.340 --> 46:54.880]  It's Michael.
[46:56.100 --> 46:56.900]  Uptown, Uptown Moe.
[46:58.200 --> 46:58.720]  There we go.
[46:58.820 --> 46:59.700]  We got Uptown Moe.
[46:59.720 --> 47:01.120]  We got Uptown Moe's card in there.
[47:01.300 --> 47:04.080]  Oh, you got to hang on to some of these cards, though, because they might be PSA grade.
[47:04.160 --> 47:05.060]  I think that one's going to be a 10.
[47:05.340 --> 47:06.360]  Yeah, it's not going to be a 10.
[47:06.560 --> 47:07.280]  Yeah, that's...
[47:07.280 --> 47:08.120]  That's not going to be a 10, dude.
[47:08.120 --> 47:09.040]  We'll hold on to it.
[47:09.060 --> 47:09.380]  Sorry, bro.
[47:10.220 --> 47:12.020]  So, Andrew, no success yet.
[47:12.080 --> 47:12.240]  No.
[47:12.340 --> 47:12.760]  Well, you know what?
[47:12.760 --> 47:13.840]  Let's keep Uptown Moe out.
[47:14.320 --> 47:15.100]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[47:15.100 --> 47:16.260]  We can kind of build around.
[47:16.420 --> 47:16.700]  Build a team.
[47:16.760 --> 47:17.360]  Yeah, build a... yeah.
[47:17.600 --> 47:18.080]  So there we go.
[47:18.160 --> 47:18.700]  There's Uptown Moe.
[47:18.780 --> 47:19.300]  There's Uptown Moe.
[47:20.280 --> 47:23.740]  You know, the problem with this, too, is Andrew didn't send return postage, so I don't know
[47:23.740 --> 47:24.560]  how he gets these back.
[47:24.580 --> 47:25.280]  I don't think he does.
[47:25.860 --> 47:26.180]  Well.
[47:27.140 --> 47:27.460]  Bummer.
[47:27.540 --> 47:28.680]  It's probably a gift to us.
[47:28.780 --> 47:28.960]  Yeah.
[47:29.520 --> 47:30.020]  Or anything.
[47:30.460 --> 47:32.520]  They do say possession is everything.
[47:33.020 --> 47:34.780]  They say that possession is everything.
[47:34.940 --> 47:35.160]  All right.
[47:35.180 --> 47:35.700]  Next pack.
[47:35.820 --> 47:36.360]  Here we go.
[47:37.480 --> 47:37.880]  Oh, shit.
[47:38.680 --> 47:39.320]  Uh-oh.
[47:39.860 --> 47:40.500]  Oh, shit.
[47:41.280 --> 47:41.600]  Okay.
[47:41.820 --> 47:42.680]  Who's it going to be?
[47:42.980 --> 47:44.080]  Who's it going to be?
[47:44.080 --> 47:46.080]  Is it going to be one of the two Andrew needs?
[47:46.300 --> 47:46.520]  It's a Darla.
[47:46.680 --> 47:47.040]  It's...
[47:47.040 --> 47:47.580]  Is it Kerwin?
[47:48.360 --> 47:49.080]  It's a...
[47:49.620 --> 47:49.980]  Waifutu!
[47:50.620 --> 47:50.800]  Waifutu!
[47:50.800 --> 47:52.420]  You should probably put it where the camera can see it.
[47:52.740 --> 47:53.100]  Waifutu.
[47:53.220 --> 47:53.800]  Right there.
[47:53.900 --> 47:54.980]  Where the camera can see it.
[47:55.020 --> 47:55.180]  Cute.
[47:55.780 --> 47:57.080]  It is not...
[47:58.260 --> 48:01.940]  They look weird when you take, like, the hair and, like, the little outfit or whatever.
[48:02.640 --> 48:03.640]  It's like a Mr. Potato Head.
[48:03.640 --> 48:03.860]  Yeah.
[48:04.280 --> 48:04.960]  There's my Waifutu card.
[48:05.060 --> 48:05.340]  Aw.
[48:05.340 --> 48:06.360]  That one's not bad.
[48:06.480 --> 48:07.840]  That might be in good condition.
[48:08.100 --> 48:08.520]  She's cute.
[48:09.960 --> 48:10.940]  I think so, maybe.
[48:11.380 --> 48:11.580]  Yeah.
[48:11.580 --> 48:11.960]  The one what?
[48:11.960 --> 48:15.980]  Michael decided who everyone was from Face Jam because Michael was collecting these also.
[48:16.100 --> 48:17.040]  Oh, did he get them all?
[48:17.460 --> 48:18.280]  Uh, no.
[48:18.440 --> 48:19.920]  I think he's missing gold and I think that's it.
[48:20.020 --> 48:20.360]  Oh, yeah.
[48:20.380 --> 48:21.340]  I hope we get gold today.
[48:21.500 --> 48:21.800]  Same.
[48:22.260 --> 48:22.460]  Why?
[48:22.520 --> 48:23.280]  So Andrew can have it?
[48:23.400 --> 48:24.260]  No, so we can have it.
[48:25.100 --> 48:26.280]  He only wants the other ones.
[48:26.360 --> 48:27.000]  He didn't ask for gold.
[48:27.180 --> 48:27.700]  It's true.
[48:28.860 --> 48:29.200]  All right.
[48:29.580 --> 48:30.240]  Sorry, Andrew.
[48:30.460 --> 48:31.060]  All right, what do we got?
[48:31.500 --> 48:32.320]  Don't look inside.
[48:32.400 --> 48:34.020]  Just pull it and then hand me the box.
[48:34.100 --> 48:34.420]  It's good.
[48:34.740 --> 48:35.220]  All right, Andrew, what's it going to be?
[48:35.220 --> 48:37.200]  Okay, remember, we are looking for Waifutu.
[48:37.280 --> 48:38.100]  We are looking for Kerwin.
[48:38.100 --> 48:40.980]  No, we're looking for Darla and Kerwin Frost.
[48:41.740 --> 48:43.080]  And this one is...
[48:46.240 --> 48:47.540]  Kerwin Frost himself!
[48:47.820 --> 48:49.480]  The man with the pencil tattoo.
[48:49.580 --> 48:50.220]  Oh, my God.
[48:50.220 --> 48:51.520]  It is the Kerwin Frost.
[48:51.620 --> 48:53.040]  Here's our Kerwin Frost card.
[48:53.280 --> 48:53.480]  Nice.
[48:53.540 --> 48:54.120]  That was my grade.
[48:54.220 --> 48:54.760]  That was pretty good.
[48:54.800 --> 48:55.640]  That was my grade.
[48:56.540 --> 48:57.640]  Congratulations, Andrew.
[48:57.640 --> 48:59.780]  You have your Kerwin Frost.
[49:00.000 --> 49:00.160]  Yep.
[49:02.440 --> 49:03.840]  Here, we'll hang on to that one.
[49:03.900 --> 49:07.520]  So when Andrew found out that they're getting rid of these, the promotion was going away.
[49:07.900 --> 49:12.400]  And so he panic-bought $150 worth of nuggets or something.
[49:12.400 --> 49:12.520]  Yeah.
[49:14.360 --> 49:17.380]  Well, he thought he was doing less and then forgot he had some in his cart.
[49:17.520 --> 49:18.420]  Okay, so don't look.
[49:19.760 --> 49:23.000]  Remember, now we are only looking for Darla and the golden one.
[49:23.000 --> 49:23.080]  Oh, shit.
[49:23.720 --> 49:24.320]  Duke's on.
[49:24.500 --> 49:25.920]  It's Waifutu 2.
[49:26.940 --> 49:27.300]  Damn.
[49:28.020 --> 49:28.720]  Waifutu 2.
[49:28.940 --> 49:29.560]  Waifutu 2.
[49:29.920 --> 49:30.300]  Waifutu 2.
[49:30.500 --> 49:31.380]  Come on, Dan.
[49:32.880 --> 49:34.600]  Only 1,000 more to open.
[49:36.860 --> 49:38.380]  This is why you save it for the end of the show, you know?
[49:38.520 --> 49:38.740]  Yeah.
[49:39.540 --> 49:40.160]  Here we go.
[49:40.240 --> 49:41.000]  What's it going to be?
[49:41.540 --> 49:42.300]  Okay, don't look at the card.
[49:42.440 --> 49:42.500]  Oh, my God.
[49:42.500 --> 49:43.280]  Not looking at the card.
[49:44.300 --> 49:47.680]  Remember, we are looking for Darla, Darla, Darla.
[49:47.860 --> 49:48.520]  And we got...
[49:51.140 --> 49:51.760]  Come on.
[49:54.580 --> 49:55.020]  Oh!
[49:55.540 --> 49:56.340]  Uptown Moe!
[49:58.940 --> 50:00.360]  Duplicates on the Uptown Moe.
[50:00.940 --> 50:01.740]  Uptown Moe.
[50:01.800 --> 50:02.820]  What the fuck?
[50:03.780 --> 50:04.020]  Damn.
[50:04.020 --> 50:05.000]  Sorry about that, Andrew.
[50:05.220 --> 50:07.640]  What if one day you woke up as a McNugget?
[50:08.040 --> 50:08.640]  That'd be cool.
[50:09.180 --> 50:10.060]  I wouldn't like that.
[50:10.720 --> 50:12.080]  Yeah, but then you live in McDonaldland.
[50:12.220 --> 50:12.700]  Don't look at the card.
[50:12.700 --> 50:13.280]  Don't look at the card.
[50:13.900 --> 50:14.960]  Okay, here we go.
[50:15.060 --> 50:15.720]  What's it going to be?
[50:15.820 --> 50:16.820]  What's it going to be?
[50:17.660 --> 50:18.960]  Who do we have?
[50:19.020 --> 50:19.740]  Who do we have?
[50:19.860 --> 50:22.660]  Hopefully it's Darla, because that's who we need.
[50:22.960 --> 50:23.960]  Okay, but what if...
[50:23.960 --> 50:26.120]  What if it's another Uptown Moe?
[50:27.140 --> 50:27.880]  Andrew, how you feeling?
[50:28.620 --> 50:30.240]  Andrew, live look at what you got.
[50:30.260 --> 50:30.760]  What are you thinking?
[50:30.820 --> 50:31.380]  Are you mad?
[50:31.760 --> 50:32.200]  Are you upset?
[50:32.440 --> 50:33.220]  Uptown Moe brigade.
[50:34.980 --> 50:36.140]  Uptown Moe you up.
[50:36.620 --> 50:38.440]  Andrew's going to have an Uptown Moe arm.
[50:41.760 --> 50:42.640]  All right.
[50:42.660 --> 50:43.380]  Who do we have?
[50:43.480 --> 50:44.100]  Who do we have?
[50:44.160 --> 50:45.160]  Looking for Darla.
[50:45.200 --> 50:46.100]  Looking for Darla.
[50:46.120 --> 50:47.300]  Looking for Darla.
[50:49.140 --> 50:52.160]  Oh, no, Andrew.
[50:54.020 --> 50:56.780]  I like the army that we're forming, though.
[50:56.880 --> 50:57.120]  Yeah.
[50:57.280 --> 50:57.960]  Yeah, we're kind of...
[50:57.960 --> 50:58.420]  We're getting them.
[50:58.640 --> 50:58.880]  Yeah.
[50:59.200 --> 50:59.740]  Pretty cool.
[50:59.940 --> 51:00.260]  God.
[51:00.420 --> 51:01.040]  Don't look.
[51:01.180 --> 51:02.200]  Don't let it be secret.
[51:03.160 --> 51:05.240]  Maybe if I change the drumbeat to snare you.
[51:05.360 --> 51:05.660]  I don't know.
[51:06.540 --> 51:08.420]  I'm starting to be able to tell by the feel, though.
[51:10.460 --> 51:11.460]  That's a pretty good idea.
[51:11.580 --> 51:12.620]  Who do you think it is?
[51:13.780 --> 51:14.260]  Kurt.
[51:18.760 --> 51:19.440]  Let's see.
[51:19.820 --> 51:21.600]  That card's in pretty good condition, too.
[51:21.700 --> 51:22.340]  Oh, no.
[51:22.880 --> 51:24.420]  They're all fucking blacked.
[51:25.480 --> 51:25.780]  Fuck.
[51:25.880 --> 51:26.120]  All right.
[51:26.120 --> 51:27.060]  Who do we have here?
[51:27.140 --> 51:27.600]  Who do we have here?
[51:27.760 --> 51:29.040]  We're looking for Darla.
[51:29.660 --> 51:30.900]  We're looking for Darla.
[51:31.980 --> 51:34.520]  Andrew, do you have a Darla?
[51:34.900 --> 51:36.520]  You do not.
[51:36.520 --> 51:38.060]  You do have a Darla.
[51:39.420 --> 51:39.820]  Nice!
[51:40.420 --> 51:40.960]  Oh, boy.
[51:41.300 --> 51:42.840]  Moe and Moe and Moe and Moe.
[51:43.180 --> 51:43.600]  Moe-moes.
[51:45.280 --> 51:45.920]  All right.
[51:46.240 --> 51:46.900]  We have one, two...
[51:46.900 --> 51:47.840]  So, we've opened up...
[51:47.840 --> 51:48.060]  Yeah.
[51:48.400 --> 51:49.420]  What are you looking at?
[51:49.460 --> 51:50.800]  We've opened up nine of these things.
[51:50.880 --> 51:51.420]  Halfway through.
[51:51.780 --> 51:52.320]  Got nine more.
[51:52.640 --> 51:53.360]  Oh, we opened up ten.
[51:53.860 --> 51:55.600]  Two, four, five, six, seven, nine.
[51:55.940 --> 51:56.680]  We're halfway through.
[51:56.980 --> 51:57.920]  We really have seven left.
[51:57.980 --> 51:58.420]  I don't know how to count.
[51:59.400 --> 51:59.800]  Sorry.
[52:00.040 --> 52:01.280]  What a pair you guys are.
[52:01.480 --> 52:01.660]  Yeah.
[52:01.720 --> 52:02.780]  Almost just sliced my finger off.
[52:02.780 --> 52:04.340]  I watched it happen!
[52:04.820 --> 52:05.900]  I'm gonna make Stab take you.
[52:06.880 --> 52:07.820]  Oh, my God.
[52:08.880 --> 52:09.180]  Okay.
[52:09.560 --> 52:10.840]  Who do we have here?
[52:11.060 --> 52:11.320]  All right.
[52:12.740 --> 52:13.180]  Darla!
[52:13.460 --> 52:14.060]  I feel like it's Darla.
[52:14.260 --> 52:14.920]  I want it to be Darla.
[52:15.540 --> 52:16.160]  Go, Darla!
[52:16.360 --> 52:17.300]  Go, Darla!
[52:18.740 --> 52:19.620]  It's Moe!
[52:19.720 --> 52:20.160]  Moe!
[52:24.140 --> 52:25.700]  He is not gonna get Darla.
[52:27.500 --> 52:28.460]  Then, let's go again.
[52:29.120 --> 52:29.780]  Here we go!
[52:30.480 --> 52:30.880]  Go, Darla!
[52:31.180 --> 52:32.060]  Darla or Golden.
[52:33.680 --> 52:37.380]  Chicken McNuggets for ten days so that he can have a fucking army of Moes.
[52:37.380 --> 52:37.980]  An army of Moes.
[52:38.620 --> 52:38.920]  Come on.
[52:38.960 --> 52:39.820]  No, Moe.
[52:40.020 --> 52:40.580]  No, Moe.
[52:40.680 --> 52:43.870]  No, Moe.
[52:43.870 --> 52:44.530]  No, Moe.
[52:44.790 --> 52:45.630]  Kerwin Frost!
[52:48.150 --> 52:49.310]  This card is...
[52:49.310 --> 52:49.930]  Oh, this one.
[52:50.030 --> 52:51.490]  Oh, my God.
[52:51.550 --> 52:52.070]  All right.
[52:52.610 --> 52:53.450]  Is that what he wanted?
[52:53.510 --> 52:54.150]  Was Kerwin Frost?
[52:54.370 --> 52:54.670]  Yeah.
[52:54.890 --> 52:55.610]  He got it.
[52:56.110 --> 52:57.570]  Did he also want Uptown Moe?
[52:59.410 --> 53:00.570]  Go, Gold.
[53:00.650 --> 53:01.070]  Go, Gold.
[53:01.110 --> 53:01.510]  Here we go.
[53:02.250 --> 53:04.150]  Andrew, how are you feeling about this one?
[53:04.150 --> 53:06.170]  Andrew, we're looking for Darla.
[53:06.490 --> 53:08.430]  Andrew, can it be?
[53:08.550 --> 53:09.550]  Will you get Darla?
[53:10.030 --> 53:11.290]  Will you get Brick?
[53:13.610 --> 53:15.250]  Or will you get...
[53:17.370 --> 53:18.610]  It's Darla!
[53:19.730 --> 53:20.710]  No, it's not.
[53:20.810 --> 53:21.950]  It's Dawn Bernice.
[53:22.170 --> 53:22.730]  What?
[53:23.070 --> 53:23.790]  No!
[53:24.770 --> 53:25.550]  Dawn Bernice.
[53:25.670 --> 53:27.390]  It's Dawn Bernice?
[53:28.010 --> 53:28.830]  Not Darla.
[53:28.870 --> 53:30.830]  Darla has the headphones on.
[53:31.090 --> 53:32.570]  Darla doesn't have glasses.
[53:32.990 --> 53:34.130]  Oh, no!
[53:35.050 --> 53:35.410]  Andrew!
[53:36.290 --> 53:37.010]  That's okay, though.
[53:37.090 --> 53:37.870]  We're not done yet.
[53:38.010 --> 53:39.050]  We're down to the last three.
[53:40.050 --> 53:41.790]  Andrew said, of course I'm mad.
[53:41.870 --> 53:44.110]  I've been waiting for an hour to be disappointed.
[53:44.630 --> 53:45.830]  It's not over yet, Andrew.
[53:45.950 --> 53:49.630]  It's not over yet because you are the proud owner of another...
[53:55.980 --> 53:57.500]  Andrew, what are you going to do with...
[53:57.500 --> 53:58.580]  You got your nugget sauce?
[53:58.740 --> 54:00.980]  You got your BTS sauce and your Uptown Moe army?
[54:01.120 --> 54:01.300]  Yep.
[54:01.680 --> 54:04.940]  We're going to make Gracie throw these all in just like a sack and then send them back
[54:04.940 --> 54:05.520]  to Andrew.
[54:05.800 --> 54:06.560]  Oh, Andrew.
[54:06.560 --> 54:07.480]  What's it going to be?
[54:07.540 --> 54:08.460]  Come on, Darla.
[54:08.620 --> 54:09.240]  How does it feel?
[54:09.340 --> 54:10.700]  It feels like a Kerwin frog.
[54:14.000 --> 54:15.800]  All right, it's the final two.
[54:16.000 --> 54:16.760]  Final two!
[54:16.840 --> 54:19.960]  We need a gold for us and we need a Darla for Andrew.
[54:20.340 --> 54:21.400]  Gold for us.
[54:21.420 --> 54:22.920]  Is it going to be...
[54:22.920 --> 54:23.780]  Come on, Darla.
[54:24.120 --> 54:24.680]  I'm not looking.
[54:24.800 --> 54:25.240]  Don't look.
[54:25.800 --> 54:26.260]  Don't look.
[54:26.380 --> 54:26.480]  I don't see.
[54:26.640 --> 54:27.520]  Oh, I feel it, though.
[54:27.640 --> 54:28.240]  Me and you.
[54:29.260 --> 54:29.800]  I feel it.
[54:30.400 --> 54:31.120]  I have a pretty good idea.
[54:31.180 --> 54:32.140]  What do you think it is?
[54:32.380 --> 54:35.940]  I have a pretty good idea that one of us is going to be disappointed because the last
[54:35.940 --> 54:37.000]  one's going to either be gold.
[54:37.300 --> 54:38.380]  This one's Kerwin frog.
[54:38.380 --> 54:38.660]  Yeah!
[54:39.240 --> 54:40.300]  Kerwin frog's right here.
[54:40.680 --> 54:42.280]  So this last one, it's either going to be...
[54:42.280 --> 54:42.700]  Oh, this is...
[54:42.700 --> 54:44.620]  It's either going to be Darla or...
[54:44.620 --> 54:45.320]  Well, you can mix it up.
[54:45.400 --> 54:48.000]  You can put, like, Uptown Moe's hair and...
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.160]  Kerwin frog has, like, uh...
[54:50.160 --> 54:51.160]  Grimmish feet.
[54:51.180 --> 54:51.940]  Yeah, they're awesome.
[54:52.300 --> 54:52.820]  Yeah, he's a Grimmish.
[54:52.820 --> 54:53.960]  I think that those are the little fries.
[54:54.440 --> 54:55.600]  Yeah, he's a classic Grimmish.
[54:55.680 --> 54:56.120]  Like a fry guy?
[54:56.380 --> 54:56.740]  But...
[54:56.740 --> 54:59.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, last McNugget buddy.
[54:59.380 --> 55:03.240]  Andrew's been waiting an hour to see if he gets a Darla and a Kerwin frog.
[55:03.420 --> 55:03.900]  Guess what, buddy?
[55:03.920 --> 55:05.280]  You got four Kerwin frogs.
[55:05.280 --> 55:06.220]  Maybe a gold.
[55:06.500 --> 55:07.080]  Five Kerwin frogs.
[55:07.120 --> 55:09.380]  You got five Kerwin frogs and six Uptown Moe's.
[55:09.960 --> 55:13.020]  But have no fear, because on the last...
[55:13.020 --> 55:13.560]  Darla!
[55:13.800 --> 55:15.560]  The very last one...
[55:15.820 --> 55:16.520]  It's gold!
[55:16.540 --> 55:17.280]  You pulled...
[55:18.660 --> 55:19.880]  A Kerwin frog!
[55:23.020 --> 55:29.260]  Out of 14 packs, you managed to get yourself one, two, three, four, five, six Uptown Moe's.
[55:29.340 --> 55:29.820]  Woo!
[55:30.100 --> 55:30.580]  Congratulations.
[55:30.700 --> 55:31.680]  You needed a Kerwin frog.
[55:31.940 --> 55:34.860]  Well, Kerwin frog delivered for you in a big way today, Andrew.
[55:35.440 --> 55:35.720]  He, uh...
[55:35.720 --> 55:36.640]  Here, just start mixing them up.
[55:36.640 --> 55:38.540]  He got, yeah, seven...
[55:38.540 --> 55:40.620]  You got seven, six Kerwin frogs.
[55:41.000 --> 55:42.820]  You got three, uh...
[55:44.020 --> 55:44.700]  Change it up.
[55:44.940 --> 55:45.180]  There you go.
[55:45.360 --> 55:47.740]  You got three Wafudus.
[55:47.880 --> 55:48.160]  Uh-huh.
[55:48.480 --> 55:50.460]  And one Don Bernice.
[55:50.660 --> 55:50.900]  There you go.
[55:51.100 --> 55:52.800]  I'm afraid we got no golden nugget.
[55:52.860 --> 55:54.940]  I'm afraid we got no Darla.
[55:55.240 --> 55:55.640]  Nakey!
[55:55.740 --> 55:56.920]  Look at that little nakey nuggy.
[55:57.100 --> 55:57.420]  There you go.
[55:58.120 --> 55:59.020]  You gotta mix them up, man.
[55:59.040 --> 56:01.640]  You gotta make a new Bernice or whatever.
[56:01.900 --> 56:02.480]  Yeah, there we go.
[56:02.500 --> 56:02.900]  There you go.
[56:03.140 --> 56:03.680]  These suck.
[56:04.800 --> 56:06.080]  Honestly, here's the thing.
[56:06.080 --> 56:07.600]  They look weird all dressed up.
[56:07.700 --> 56:10.280]  When you do this and you go, oh, they're like the little McNugget.
[56:10.360 --> 56:10.920]  I like that.
[56:11.060 --> 56:11.240]  Yeah.
[56:11.260 --> 56:11.940]  This is cool.
[56:12.300 --> 56:13.220]  I like the whole thing.
[56:13.280 --> 56:14.300]  I like everything about it.
[56:14.360 --> 56:17.260]  The only thing that I don't like is that Andrew didn't get the one he wanted.
[56:17.400 --> 56:17.620]  Uh-huh.
[56:17.660 --> 56:20.980]  But kind of the only thing that I do like is that Andrew didn't get the one that he wanted.
[56:22.000 --> 56:22.220]  Uh...
[56:22.220 --> 56:24.060]  It's weird he's not responding to me anymore.
[56:24.180 --> 56:25.140]  He's fucking plunged.
[56:25.140 --> 56:27.100]  You think he's making more orders to McDonald's?
[56:27.100 --> 56:27.740]  No, he's...
[56:27.740 --> 56:28.400]  You know what he's doing?
[56:28.580 --> 56:29.840]  He's having a quiet time in his bath.
[56:29.860 --> 56:30.400]  Yeah, absolutely.
[56:30.660 --> 56:30.960]  Uh...
[56:30.960 --> 56:35.500]  He ran straight to his bathroom, slammed the door shut, turned the lights off, lit a candle,
[56:35.500 --> 56:39.640]  pulled out a cupcake, and now he's sitting in his bath, watching it fill up around him,
[56:39.740 --> 56:43.540]  waiting until it's full so that he can eat his cupcake and stew.
[56:43.700 --> 56:45.800]  Do you think he put the candle in the cupcake so he could blow it out?
[56:46.480 --> 56:46.840]  Oh...
[56:47.560 --> 56:47.920]  Oh...
[56:47.920 --> 56:49.440]  That's like the saddest birthday ever.
[56:49.660 --> 56:49.980]  Sad.
[56:50.480 --> 56:50.980]  I don't like it.
[56:51.680 --> 56:51.840]  No.
[56:53.020 --> 56:54.760]  Gracie thought maybe it was Andrew's birthday.
[56:54.960 --> 56:55.320]  Fuck!
[56:56.540 --> 56:58.220]  Yeah, remember we told you to send him the...
[56:58.220 --> 56:59.100]  You didn't send him the cake!
[56:59.100 --> 56:59.480]  You didn't send him the cake!
[56:59.520 --> 57:00.260]  Oh, no!
[57:01.760 --> 57:04.080]  Well, we didn't get gold either, so it just sucks.
[57:04.080 --> 57:06.220]  Yeah, but we didn't spend $150 on McDonald's.
[57:07.000 --> 57:08.440]  Well, let's open up some baseball cards.
[57:08.700 --> 57:09.020]  Yeah!
[57:09.320 --> 57:10.520]  They don't have them anymore?
[57:10.880 --> 57:12.180]  No, they've been gone for a while, I think.
[57:12.260 --> 57:15.660]  He's gonna have to eBay them. He's gonna see if someone will take his BTS sauces and trade.
[57:15.740 --> 57:17.720]  He's gonna have to trade on the nugget market.
[57:17.800 --> 57:18.500]  Oh, shit.
[57:18.800 --> 57:19.060]  Yeah.
[57:19.720 --> 57:20.620]  That's rough, man.
[57:21.140 --> 57:22.160]  I feel bad about it.
[57:22.500 --> 57:23.860]  I feel medium about it.
[57:23.920 --> 57:27.380]  I feel good about getting this Alex Bregman card, though.
[57:27.480 --> 57:28.120]  Oh, here we go.
[57:28.300 --> 57:29.000]  You gotta move it up some.
[57:29.540 --> 57:30.220]  Put it on the crown.
[57:30.380 --> 57:31.160]  Yeah, there you go.
[57:31.300 --> 57:32.280]  Down a little bit.
[57:32.880 --> 57:33.460]  Yep, there you go.
[57:33.460 --> 57:34.400]  There you go.
[57:34.400 --> 57:34.760]  Looks good.
[57:35.080 --> 57:35.860]  Looks good!
[57:37.000 --> 57:37.420]  Good.
[57:39.400 --> 57:40.600]  Here, use all the top hats.
[57:40.600 --> 57:40.920]  Come on, fish us!
[57:41.240 --> 57:41.660]  There you go, there you go.
[57:44.120 --> 57:45.000]  Here it comes, ready?
[57:45.380 --> 57:46.080]  There it is!
[57:46.640 --> 57:50.620]  Here we have a refractor, silver refractor of J.P. Crawford.
[57:50.660 --> 57:51.000]  Nice.
[57:51.240 --> 57:51.840]  Cool, cool shot.
[57:52.080 --> 57:52.180]  Uh-huh.
[57:53.100 --> 57:55.620]  Here we have Javier Assad.
[57:55.780 --> 57:56.700]  Trying to focus.
[57:56.820 --> 57:58.320]  And Reese Hoskins.
[57:58.680 --> 57:58.960]  Okay.
[57:59.260 --> 58:01.300]  And then this is the last pack we're gonna open today.
[58:01.320 --> 58:01.820]  Oh, wow.
[58:01.820 --> 58:02.940]  This is it, last pack of mojos.
[58:03.440 --> 58:04.720]  Yep, but next week.
[58:04.880 --> 58:06.200]  Next week we're gonna open up some other stuff.
[58:06.300 --> 58:07.800]  I think we're gonna try to have some wrestling stuff.
[58:07.860 --> 58:09.960]  Yeah, I wanted a bunch of AEW cards.
[58:10.440 --> 58:11.260]  I wanna open some AEW cards.
[58:11.260 --> 58:13.220]  You've been doing, like, the calling and stuff, right?
[58:13.220 --> 58:15.720]  Yeah, AAPW is where I do announcing on Saturday nights.
[58:16.120 --> 58:17.580]  Look at Jonathan Aranda's face there.
[58:17.660 --> 58:18.680]  He is booking it.
[58:18.680 --> 58:19.040]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[58:19.400 --> 58:21.460]  He is turning those bases.

[58:41.040 --> 58:41.960]  Sleep that, please.

[58:46.320 --> 58:48.680]  You gotta stop and get a shake.
