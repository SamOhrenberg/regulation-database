[00:01.940 --> 00:05.460]  Hello and welcome to Fuck Face Presents Opening Day.
[00:05.580 --> 00:06.440]  You may be thinking to yourself,
[00:07.240 --> 00:10.680]  but Geoff, Opening Day for the Major League Baseball Association,
[00:10.860 --> 00:12.160]  that's not for seven more days.
[00:12.180 --> 00:13.280]  It's but a week away, Geoff.
[00:13.340 --> 00:15.680]  Yeah, we're coming in a week early. We're coming in too hot.
[00:15.760 --> 00:16.780]  We can't wait for them.
[00:16.840 --> 00:17.080]  That's right.
[00:17.120 --> 00:20.560]  So we're, we're, we're scooping them. We're scooping them out.
[00:20.600 --> 00:22.540]  We're scooping Major League Baseball.
[00:22.640 --> 00:25.800]  It's called Opening Day, Eric, because today's a day.
[00:26.200 --> 00:29.300]  So that applies. And we're going to open stuff.
[00:29.300 --> 00:30.520]  Oh my God. There you go.
[00:30.980 --> 00:33.720]  And we're not just, as Howard Stern would say,
[00:33.780 --> 00:34.420]  we're not just here for our health.
[00:34.600 --> 00:36.500]  No. We're also here to sell some crap.
[00:36.600 --> 00:36.980]  That's right.
[00:37.400 --> 00:41.520]  We have the Fuck Face regulation hat,
[00:42.120 --> 00:44.380]  which is a very nice team.
[00:44.460 --> 00:48.400]  Sorry, team hat with regulation equipment on the inside,
[00:48.520 --> 00:50.100]  the green underbill, which is my request.
[00:50.700 --> 00:54.160]  It's the embellishments on this merch that really sets it apart,
[00:54.220 --> 00:55.180]  I feel like. Uniform.
[00:55.180 --> 00:58.980]  Uniform. Combining the power of the form with the fabric of the form.
[00:59.220 --> 01:00.880]  Uniform. The fabric of the one.
[01:01.000 --> 01:01.760]  Oh my God.
[01:02.380 --> 01:05.000]  Uniform. Combining the power of the one with the fabric of the form. Uniform.
[01:05.300 --> 01:10.340]  We're also selling the official Face jersey, number 16.
[01:12.480 --> 01:15.520]  There's the jersey. And then the back is number 16.
[01:15.720 --> 01:19.040]  It's beautiful. Great. Good stuff.
[01:19.240 --> 01:21.340]  Also sponsored by Uniform.
[01:21.480 --> 01:24.580]  By Uniform. Uniform. You know that thing.
[01:25.080 --> 01:29.540]  Jesus. Also, green bat. Green mini bat variant.
[01:29.880 --> 01:32.860]  I gotta be honest with you. I think the green bat is maybe the best thing we've sold today.
[01:32.880 --> 01:34.880]  Love the variant. Love the green bat.
[01:35.020 --> 01:38.040]  It's good stuff, but not to be outdone.
[01:38.560 --> 01:42.860]  Also, the Face Jam Monkey League baseball t-shirt.
[01:43.080 --> 01:44.620]  So get a Monkey League baseball t-shirt.
[01:44.760 --> 01:48.860]  All of this goes on sale in less than 10 minutes, 1110 AM Central.
[01:49.080 --> 01:50.300]  Look, he's like afraid of the baseball.
[01:51.580 --> 01:55.100]  He's like Justin Turner. He's about to get hit in the face with a baseball.
[01:56.200 --> 01:59.200]  He's having a rough spring training, Justin Turner.
[01:59.220 --> 02:01.580]  So did Austin Nola, but he's already back, so what does that say?
[02:03.460 --> 02:05.460]  Whoever pitched against Justin Turner, so it's harder, I guess.
[02:05.480 --> 02:06.380]  It's one stronger.
[02:10.400 --> 02:15.620]  Explain something to me. Is Monkey League baseball a big part of Face Jam, or is that just an attempt to rip off Fuck Face?
[02:16.820 --> 02:19.700]  You think that this is an attempt to rip off Fuck Face?
[02:20.440 --> 02:21.920]  It's a pretty baseball-heavy podcast.
[02:22.720 --> 02:25.720]  I think we've gone on record to say we're not a baseball podcast.
[02:25.800 --> 02:27.040]  You're right, we're a baseballs podcast.
[02:28.840 --> 02:34.740]  No, we had an idea for this Monkey League baseball thing, and Tony came up with a cool design.
[02:35.100 --> 02:42.900]  And we have some content for Face Jam that we haven't recorded yet that we're hopefully doing in the next month or so with the baseball season starting.
[02:43.020 --> 02:43.260]  Okay.
[02:43.400 --> 02:49.520]  That I'm very excited about if we can get, frankly, sneaky enough to where they don't stop us.
[02:50.200 --> 02:50.520]  Alright.
[02:51.120 --> 02:54.440]  So, we will see what happens at the Dell Diamond.
[02:55.660 --> 02:58.960]  Well, I gotta say, I'm a big fan of Nick, so I'll allow it.
[02:58.980 --> 03:00.080]  Oh, that's good. Okay, cool.
[03:00.620 --> 03:02.140]  I'm a fan. I'm pro-any Nick merch.
[03:02.220 --> 03:03.940]  Do you think he's worn the mask yet in an episode?
[03:04.560 --> 03:06.600]  No, I don't think so. I don't think so at all.
[03:06.820 --> 03:06.860]  Okay.
[03:06.960 --> 03:07.680]  No, he's laughing too much.
[03:07.940 --> 03:08.180]  Oh.
[03:08.960 --> 03:09.760]  We can tell. We can tell.
[03:10.660 --> 03:14.180]  Okay, so if you want to buy this shit, you can, but not yet.
[03:14.320 --> 03:15.880]  Store.roosterteeth.com is the address.
[03:15.880 --> 03:19.500]  We decided not to put it on sale for the first 10 minutes, just so we can talk about it.
[03:19.640 --> 03:26.380]  Because if we were late going live, and then everything went up, then I would have to hear about it, and that's what I don't want.
[03:26.480 --> 03:27.060]  You don't want that.
[03:27.440 --> 03:28.540]  Just don't tell me about it.
[03:28.560 --> 03:29.240]  He doesn't want to know.
[03:29.340 --> 03:31.160]  I don't want to hear it. I just don't want to hear it.
[03:31.220 --> 03:31.980]  He doesn't want to hear it.
[03:32.080 --> 03:33.780]  Do you know what you do want to hear about?
[03:34.100 --> 03:34.500]  What's that?
[03:34.720 --> 03:35.560]  Fun card stuff.
[03:35.940 --> 03:40.120]  Wow! Geoff said that he just kept going, hee hee, I have so many surprises for you.
[03:40.120 --> 03:41.120]  I do. I'm so excited.
[03:41.480 --> 03:43.380]  It's been forever since we've done a break show.
[03:43.440 --> 03:43.580]  Yeah.
[03:43.960 --> 03:49.280]  Although when we get back into the swing of things, you should have seen the eye roll Eric gave me when I told him I wanted to do it weekly.
[03:49.860 --> 03:51.640]  So, oh! But that's not just what he said!
[03:51.880 --> 03:57.340]  Because you didn't just say, oh, I want to do it weekly. He's like, oh, I want to do it weekly, but like, you know, on weeks that I'm here.
[03:57.660 --> 03:58.380]  Yeah, most weeks.
[03:58.980 --> 04:00.620]  Everybody's on a lot of vacation every once in a while.
[04:00.700 --> 04:01.880]  That's not what weekly means.
[04:02.000 --> 04:02.500]  Mostly weekly.
[04:03.240 --> 04:03.620]  That sucks.
[04:03.620 --> 04:04.680]  I want to do it mostly weekly.
[04:04.820 --> 04:05.460]  That sucks.
[04:05.660 --> 04:08.160]  What if I, if there's 50, how many weeks in a year? 52 weeks in a year?
[04:08.280 --> 04:09.520]  Yeah, were you going to get the thing wrong?
[04:09.520 --> 04:12.740]  What if I did it, what if I did 47 weeks? Doesn't that seem mostly weekly?
[04:12.740 --> 04:17.500]  I suppose so, I guess it's just the pitch where you go weekly, except for the weeks I don't want to do it.
[04:17.500 --> 04:20.800]  Well, except for like, I'm going on vacation in April, obviously I can't do it then.
[04:20.860 --> 04:22.860]  We don't want to pre-record it, you just gotta...
[04:22.860 --> 04:23.200]  Oh.
[04:25.360 --> 04:26.120]  I guess we could...
[04:26.120 --> 04:26.820]  Are you new?
[04:26.820 --> 04:32.540]  I always assume it's, I feel of it as a live event, but we could pre-record.
[04:32.680 --> 04:33.980]  Read and chat, get real.
[04:34.340 --> 04:34.800]  That's true.
[04:35.180 --> 04:35.760]  That's an excellent point.
[04:35.860 --> 04:36.720]  This is why you're a good producer.
[04:37.820 --> 04:40.140]  Speaking of which, you should probably produce this show.
[04:40.200 --> 04:41.200]  I think you should open something.
[04:41.260 --> 04:42.160]  There you go, thank you producer.
[04:43.100 --> 04:46.540]  Like I said, I've been holding on to this stuff forever because I haven't done one of these in a while.
[04:46.820 --> 04:46.880]  Long time.
[04:46.880 --> 04:49.200]  So I got some specials I want to roll out.
[04:49.260 --> 04:49.400]  Okay.
[04:49.640 --> 04:52.780]  But first, of course, as always, Pac-Sac.
[04:53.280 --> 04:55.980]  You were going to say it the right way, and then you had to look at it.
[04:55.980 --> 04:58.100]  I had to look at it to make sure I said it right, Pac-Sac.
[04:58.700 --> 05:00.560]  We're going to, oh, T2, those are always terrible.
[05:00.700 --> 05:01.220]  Oh, nice.
[05:02.080 --> 05:02.400]  And...
[05:04.140 --> 05:05.560]  Okay, we'll open up that one.
[05:06.080 --> 05:06.400]  Troll?
[05:07.580 --> 05:09.220]  And you'll have to help me with the Power Rangers.
[05:09.420 --> 05:11.900]  Oh, they have a new Uten Netflix thing.
[05:11.900 --> 05:15.360]  I saw that, they're old and they're at like the fair or something.
[05:15.520 --> 05:18.420]  Yeah, they're like, it's all your favorite Power Rangers and none of them are Kimberly.
[05:18.560 --> 05:19.140]  So what are we doing?
[05:19.620 --> 05:20.680]  I don't know what that means.
[05:22.100 --> 05:23.040]  That's the age difference.
[05:23.400 --> 05:24.300]  Yeah, a little bit of an age.
[05:24.360 --> 05:25.220]  Apparently it's before my time.
[05:25.700 --> 05:27.460]  And also, we're going to select 10...
[05:27.460 --> 05:28.300]  Before your time?
[05:29.080 --> 05:29.700]  After my time.
[05:31.400 --> 05:32.040]  After my time.
[05:32.720 --> 05:33.440]  Cool, 26?
[05:35.520 --> 05:40.360]  We will take 10 cards today that we find and we will, we're going to set them aside.
[05:40.360 --> 05:43.560]  We're going to put them in these little fuckface card sleeves that we have.
[05:43.680 --> 05:44.660]  Let's pop that up there.
[05:44.980 --> 05:45.340]  Boom!
[05:45.780 --> 05:46.380]  Doesn't that look cool?
[05:46.400 --> 05:49.200]  That way you can see the fuckface logo but not half of your card.
[05:49.240 --> 05:54.620]  So if you buy merch today, you might be one of the 10 who receives something.
[05:55.000 --> 05:56.460]  One of these plucked cards.
[05:57.180 --> 05:59.440]  The ones that we determine are the best of the best.
[05:59.500 --> 06:00.660]  Two angry aliens right there.
[06:00.800 --> 06:02.540]  Two angry aliens, the way to power.
[06:03.240 --> 06:04.200]  Oh, here's a good one.
[06:04.360 --> 06:05.240]  Here's a good one.
[06:05.340 --> 06:05.960]  I don't know anything...
[06:05.960 --> 06:07.320]  Oh, there's a better one behind it.
[06:08.220 --> 06:08.580]  Goofballs!
[06:08.840 --> 06:09.860]  These are some goofballs.
[06:10.420 --> 06:12.560]  That's Bulk and his friend, Skull.
[06:12.680 --> 06:13.560]  I'm going to put those over here.
[06:13.600 --> 06:14.020]  That's a good one.
[06:14.080 --> 06:14.500]  That's a good one.
[06:14.600 --> 06:16.340]  And then this one's even better, Bulk and Skull.
[06:16.460 --> 06:17.080]  There they are.
[06:17.700 --> 06:19.020]  I don't know what's better.
[06:19.500 --> 06:20.100]  I like this too.
[06:20.460 --> 06:21.260]  Uh-oh!
[06:21.580 --> 06:22.080]  Too late!
[06:22.220 --> 06:22.680]  Too late?
[06:22.780 --> 06:23.720]  We didn't get there in time.
[06:23.740 --> 06:24.820]  Are these in the movie?
[06:25.120 --> 06:25.700]  This is from the movie?
[06:25.940 --> 06:26.580]  Oh, Lord.
[06:27.220 --> 06:28.720]  My uncle worked on this movie.
[06:28.800 --> 06:30.060]  I thought this was a kid's show.
[06:30.400 --> 06:30.800]  It was.
[06:31.240 --> 06:31.960]  Who's that?
[06:34.880 --> 06:35.240]  Buh!
[06:36.920 --> 06:37.640]  That's a...
[06:40.920 --> 06:41.480]  Dinosaur lady?
[06:41.740 --> 06:42.580]  By Fight Dinosaurs or something?
[06:43.040 --> 06:43.880]  Probably Fight Dinosaurs.
[06:44.120 --> 06:44.720]  Yeah, I would think.
[06:44.920 --> 06:46.000]  That sounds like a Power Rangers thing.
[06:46.000 --> 06:46.820]  Like an old-timey lady?
[06:46.960 --> 06:47.120]  Yeah.
[06:48.040 --> 06:48.820]  That sounds right to me.
[06:48.900 --> 06:49.200]  All right.
[06:49.360 --> 06:52.800]  Well, I'm going to set aside Bulk and Skull and Goofballs, because I think those are cute.
[06:53.680 --> 06:54.000]  Let's...
[06:54.000 --> 06:54.780]  Now we've got Troll!
[06:54.960 --> 06:55.740]  Let's see what's up with Troll.
[06:56.040 --> 06:56.320]  Okay.
[06:56.700 --> 06:58.680]  Now, is this Troll the movie or Trolls?
[06:58.740 --> 06:59.520]  I bet it's Trolls.
[06:59.540 --> 07:00.560]  There's no way it's Troll the movie.
[07:00.700 --> 07:01.780]  That'd be fucking cool if it was.
[07:03.340 --> 07:03.920]  What is it?
[07:04.100 --> 07:04.900]  You would probably be right.
[07:05.280 --> 07:07.120]  Uh, well, here's a Ninja Troll.
[07:07.260 --> 07:07.560]  Okay.
[07:07.560 --> 07:08.660]  I don't give a shit about that.
[07:09.960 --> 07:10.580]  Robble Mall.
[07:11.820 --> 07:12.220]  What?
[07:12.960 --> 07:13.760]  Here's a...
[07:13.760 --> 07:14.740]  Is he a robot?
[07:15.060 --> 07:15.320]  Dude.
[07:15.840 --> 07:16.180]  Rob...
[07:16.180 --> 07:17.140]  Oh, no, he's stealing.
[07:17.640 --> 07:18.160]  Robble Mall.
[07:18.340 --> 07:18.740]  Oh, Robble Mall.
[07:18.840 --> 07:19.600]  Uh, Robble Mall.
[07:19.840 --> 07:21.040]  Uh, this one...
[07:21.040 --> 07:21.640]  That's dumb.
[07:21.740 --> 07:23.620]  If that didn't confuse you, this one definitely will.
[07:24.220 --> 07:31.260]  Uh, have you ever thought to yourself, boy, I'd love a You Bug Me Too Troll Driver's License?
[07:31.580 --> 07:32.900]  We should get that to, like, Gavin.
[07:33.180 --> 07:33.460]  Yeah.
[07:33.740 --> 07:34.620]  We'll finally get one, right?
[07:35.220 --> 07:36.200]  We can put his picture...
[07:36.200 --> 07:37.540]  We'll tell him it's a...
[07:37.540 --> 07:37.760]  Look at that.
[07:37.840 --> 07:38.240]  It counts.
[07:38.820 --> 07:39.180]  His...
[07:39.180 --> 07:39.860]  He'll believe anything.
[07:40.240 --> 07:41.160]  License and registration?
[07:41.620 --> 07:42.380]  There you go.
[07:43.960 --> 07:44.900]  Sir, step out of the car.
[07:45.140 --> 07:46.120]  Step out of the car right now.
[07:47.000 --> 07:48.400]  Those guys are sweethearts.
[07:49.000 --> 07:49.340]  Nice.
[07:49.340 --> 07:49.940]  Uh, Sharon of Malta.
[07:50.060 --> 07:51.060]  Here's Jack the Gripper.
[07:51.480 --> 07:53.880]  Not to be confused with Jack the Ripper who murdered women.
[07:54.000 --> 07:54.200]  Yeah.
[07:56.060 --> 07:56.420]  Uh...
[07:56.420 --> 07:56.780]  Hur...
[07:57.620 --> 07:57.980]  Hurly...
[07:57.980 --> 07:58.460]  Pound him.
[07:59.700 --> 08:00.660]  Is that, like, a sex thing?
[08:00.720 --> 08:01.460]  These suck.
[08:01.720 --> 08:02.380]  Yeah, these aren't great.
[08:02.440 --> 08:03.420]  Jack the Gripper again.
[08:03.580 --> 08:04.480]  You got doubles with that one.
[08:04.620 --> 08:06.460]  And if anybody's looking to trade for Jack the Gripper, I got two.
[08:06.460 --> 08:08.080]  Uh, Loot-a-Troll.
[08:08.260 --> 08:10.820]  If anyone's looking to trade for Jack the Gripper, you can have both.
[08:12.240 --> 08:13.440]  Alright, now we'll do Terminator.
[08:13.620 --> 08:13.700]  Nice.
[08:13.700 --> 08:16.780]  And then we'll move on from the pack sack to some fun, exciting stuff.
[08:16.900 --> 08:17.260]  I'm excited.
[08:18.080 --> 08:18.980]  It's nice to be back.
[08:19.300 --> 08:20.180]  It's nice to be back.
[08:20.240 --> 08:22.800]  To be doing, uh, to be doing this again and hopefully more frequently.
[08:22.960 --> 08:23.600]  I miss this.
[08:23.660 --> 08:23.820]  Yeah.
[08:23.980 --> 08:25.800]  Much like I miss Human Casualties.
[08:25.960 --> 08:26.580]  Oh my gosh.
[08:26.600 --> 08:27.260]  It's over.
[08:27.800 --> 08:28.080]  Nice.
[08:28.280 --> 08:30.320]  The face of Sarah's worst nightmare.
[08:30.700 --> 08:34.880]  Well, no, because that's who helps her, I mean, in the second one, which that is, so...
[08:34.880 --> 08:36.380]  Yeah, I think that card's proven wrong.
[08:38.000 --> 08:39.060]  Talk to us.
[08:39.180 --> 08:40.120]  Don't you care?
[08:41.860 --> 08:43.120]  Sarah confronts the SWAT team.
[08:43.360 --> 08:44.760]  Hey, SWAT team, back off!
[08:45.080 --> 08:45.940]  Is that the Skynet scene?
[08:46.420 --> 08:49.700]  Uh, I think it's when they're at the...
[08:49.700 --> 08:50.000]  Yeah.
[08:50.220 --> 08:51.040]  Yeah, I think it is, actually.
[08:51.220 --> 08:51.540]  I think it is.
[08:52.080 --> 08:55.000]  Uh, are there authorized... are these authorized personnel?
[08:55.480 --> 08:55.960]  Can Geoff read?
[08:56.040 --> 08:56.700]  That's the Skynet scene.
[08:57.780 --> 09:01.240]  Uh, Sunday morning at the home of Miles Dyson.
[09:01.700 --> 09:02.260]  Miles Dyson.
[09:02.580 --> 09:04.820]  He, uh, helped create the neural net processor.
[09:05.020 --> 09:05.280]  It's true.
[09:05.340 --> 09:06.280]  That, uh, took us all down.
[09:06.280 --> 09:08.360]  He helped end humanity.
[09:09.480 --> 09:12.540]  Uh, faster! He's right on us, they say.
[09:13.280 --> 09:16.440]  Aw, dreams meet reality for Kyle and Sarah.
[09:16.880 --> 09:18.560]  She remembers back when she...
[09:18.560 --> 09:23.180]  Is that a scene from Terminator 1 in Terminator 2 on the card for Terminator 2?
[09:23.340 --> 09:23.860]  Yeah, I think...
[09:23.860 --> 09:25.080]  Is everything on sale right now?
[09:25.140 --> 09:25.720]  I think she...
[09:25.720 --> 09:27.320]  Is everything on sale right now?
[09:27.420 --> 09:27.960]  I think it must be.
[09:28.020 --> 09:30.800]  If you go to startoutroosterteeth.com, can you buy this green minibat?
[09:30.980 --> 09:31.440]  You probably could.
[09:31.460 --> 09:33.920]  Can you buy this hat, this face hat?
[09:34.600 --> 09:36.080]  I think she's remembering.
[09:36.440 --> 09:36.660]  I'm not done.
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.780]  Uh, can you buy this face jersey?
[09:40.180 --> 09:40.900]  Can you buy this purple...
[09:41.400 --> 09:42.280]  No, you can't buy...
[09:42.280 --> 09:42.400]  No.
[09:42.660 --> 09:43.900]  You can't buy the green one either.
[09:44.160 --> 09:49.380]  Uh, but you can buy this Base Jam Monkey League baseball shirt, baby!
[09:49.700 --> 09:50.780]  Can you buy this VCK?
[09:51.040 --> 09:51.780]  Yeah, that's...
[09:51.780 --> 09:52.920]  But that's not what we're here for.
[09:52.920 --> 09:54.140]  No, no, but you can buy it.
[09:54.420 --> 09:55.300]  I mean, you can definitely buy...
[09:55.300 --> 09:55.940]  That's on sale.
[09:56.100 --> 09:56.960]  I'm not gonna stop you from buying it.
[09:56.960 --> 09:57.620]  No, no.
[09:58.540 --> 09:59.520]  Uh, yeah, Michael Bayne.
[09:59.780 --> 10:02.460]  I think she's probably remembering back when she got... the last time she got laid.
[10:02.500 --> 10:02.720]  Okay.
[10:02.860 --> 10:03.380]  Within a minute.
[10:03.380 --> 10:06.940]  But she's been focusing on teaching her kid how to save the world.
[10:07.300 --> 10:09.280]  Uh, James Cameron directs, uh...
[10:09.280 --> 10:09.680]  What?!
[10:09.680 --> 10:10.620]  Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[10:10.740 --> 10:12.080]  That's a behind-the-scenes shot.
[10:12.280 --> 10:13.420]  I mean, that's not from the movie.
[10:13.520 --> 10:15.120]  He's like... he's like...
[10:15.120 --> 10:18.180]  He's like, you say it right and we'll give you a knuckle sandwich!
[10:19.760 --> 10:22.260]  James Cameron's gonna kick Arnold Schwarzenegger's ass.
[10:22.500 --> 10:25.120]  The T-1000 reforms once more.
[10:25.200 --> 10:27.760]  Not reforms, like, I've had that change of voice.
[10:28.200 --> 10:29.760]  Uh, I've seen the light.
[10:29.960 --> 10:30.540]  Uh, here we go.
[10:30.540 --> 10:34.480]  Uh, T-1000 commandeers a tanker.
[10:34.660 --> 10:34.900]  Wow.
[10:36.000 --> 10:37.380]  And, uh, some crap.
[10:38.240 --> 10:38.540]  Okay.
[10:38.820 --> 10:40.060]  Not a lot going on in Terminator.
[10:40.160 --> 10:40.960]  Didn't expect there to be.
[10:41.060 --> 10:48.300]  Uh, don't like the way those cards are laid out where you only see very little of the clip from the movie and mostly it's a border.
[10:48.540 --> 10:51.080]  I find that to be the case with almost all cards we open.
[10:51.300 --> 10:51.740]  Sucks.
[10:51.780 --> 10:52.320]  From that era.
[10:52.500 --> 10:52.700]  It does suck.
[10:52.700 --> 10:53.360]  It really sucks.
[10:53.820 --> 10:54.920]  I wanna do something fun.
[10:55.080 --> 10:55.280]  Okay.
[10:55.600 --> 10:56.620]  I wanna do something a little different.
[10:56.780 --> 10:57.100]  Okay.
[10:57.660 --> 10:59.340]  I bought the other day at the grocery store.
[10:59.460 --> 10:59.760]  Mm-hmm.
[10:59.760 --> 11:00.640]  I saw this.
[11:01.080 --> 11:01.580]  I thought of you.
[11:01.740 --> 11:01.960]  Okay.
[11:02.240 --> 11:03.440]  You like to rock out.
[11:03.900 --> 11:05.580]  Guys, I wanna rock.
[11:05.800 --> 11:06.380]  You wanna rock.
[11:06.420 --> 11:06.660]  That's me.
[11:06.920 --> 11:08.360]  And I know we typically open cards here.
[11:08.380 --> 11:08.540]  Yeah.
[11:08.920 --> 11:13.480]  But I saw this and I thought, what if we open a concert ticket box?
[11:13.720 --> 11:14.020]  What?
[11:14.280 --> 11:15.960]  Pop Century concert tickets.
[11:16.260 --> 11:19.240]  One concert ticket per box.
[11:19.440 --> 11:20.220]  It could be the Eagles.
[11:20.600 --> 11:21.940]  It could be Rascal Flatts.
[11:22.000 --> 11:22.740]  Okay, so...
[11:22.740 --> 11:24.420]  It could be Ozzy Osbourne or Aerosmith.
[11:24.660 --> 11:25.620]  It's a ticket...
[11:25.620 --> 11:26.260]  Is it Prince?
[11:26.800 --> 11:28.080]  It's a ticket from...
[11:28.080 --> 11:30.280]  But it doesn't get...
[11:30.280 --> 11:32.080]  But it's a concert you didn't go to?
[11:32.160 --> 11:32.980]  It's a concert you didn't go to.
[11:33.020 --> 11:33.760]  It's like a collectible.
[11:37.280 --> 11:38.100]  I don't know.
[11:38.200 --> 11:39.260]  I've never opened one of these before.
[11:39.360 --> 11:40.700]  I almost just cut my fucking finger off.
[11:40.900 --> 11:41.220]  Oh, cool.
[11:41.380 --> 11:43.080]  It's a real doesn't-do situation.
[11:43.860 --> 11:44.600]  Doesn't Do, out now.
[11:45.140 --> 11:45.580]  Go watch Doesn't Do.
[11:45.580 --> 11:45.840]  Oh, yeah.
[11:46.480 --> 11:47.180]  Go check it out.
[11:47.400 --> 11:51.520]  It's on our base YouTube channel.
[11:51.600 --> 11:52.580]  Go check out the show.
[11:52.600 --> 11:52.980]  It's on Rooster Teeth.
[11:53.100 --> 11:55.320]  The show that finally sent me to the emergency room.
[11:55.620 --> 11:55.940]  Yay!
[11:56.220 --> 11:57.500]  After 20 years of Rooster Teeth.
[11:57.500 --> 11:59.480]  After Stab producing it at the time.
[11:59.500 --> 12:00.580]  Produced by a guy named Stab.
[12:00.600 --> 12:00.780]  Yeah.
[12:00.940 --> 12:04.580]  And then, I mean, just this trot the rest of the day.
[12:04.800 --> 12:06.020]  Oh, I felt so bad for him.
[12:06.020 --> 12:06.880]  I felt so bad for Stab.
[12:06.880 --> 12:08.960]  I felt worse for him than I felt for all the blood in me.
[12:08.960 --> 12:09.560]  You were fine.
[12:09.640 --> 12:10.820]  I didn't really care that you...
[12:10.820 --> 12:11.680]  I mean, you were fine.
[12:11.880 --> 12:12.320]  Yeah, I was fine.
[12:12.340 --> 12:12.900]  Nothing to worry about.
[12:12.940 --> 12:13.700]  Okay, hang on.
[12:13.700 --> 12:18.940]  Before you open it, what band or what performing artist do you think it's going to be?
[12:18.960 --> 12:19.460]  I have a guess.
[12:20.240 --> 12:22.160]  I think it's going to be Bonnie Wright.
[12:22.540 --> 12:23.380]  Ed Sheeran.
[12:23.520 --> 12:24.260]  Ed Sheeran.
[12:24.300 --> 12:24.500]  Mm-hmm.
[12:25.420 --> 12:26.060]  What'd we get?
[12:26.060 --> 12:27.320]  We got Congratulations.
[12:27.320 --> 12:31.220]  You have received a Vintage Concert Ticket from Leaf Trading Cards.
[12:31.300 --> 12:33.400]  This card is the authentic ticket of Keith Urban.
[12:33.860 --> 12:34.260]  Yeah!
[12:35.600 --> 12:36.020]  Great.
[12:36.660 --> 12:37.480]  That's awesome.
[12:37.700 --> 12:38.600]  Oh, boy.
[12:38.940 --> 12:40.120]  Hard Rock Live.
[12:41.040 --> 12:42.760]  August 17th, 2019.
[12:43.160 --> 12:43.940]  Do you guys remember?
[12:44.180 --> 12:44.860]  Better days, baby.
[12:45.160 --> 12:48.400]  The Keith Urban ticket to the show.
[12:48.560 --> 12:48.760]  Uh-huh.
[12:48.780 --> 12:49.880]  Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.
[12:50.880 --> 12:51.660]  Yeah, that was a good one.
[12:51.800 --> 12:54.100]  Did you go August 17th, 2019?
[12:54.420 --> 12:54.620]  No.
[12:54.620 --> 12:56.200]  In the audience, if you did, let us know.
[12:56.340 --> 12:56.400]  No.
[12:56.700 --> 12:58.260]  This is $164 ticket.
[12:58.380 --> 12:58.980]  It's elevated, though.
[12:59.380 --> 13:00.140]  Put that right there.
[13:00.200 --> 13:04.780]  When I worked at a country radio station, we got a lot of Keith Urban play.
[13:04.980 --> 13:06.100]  Like, there was a lot.
[13:06.300 --> 13:09.100]  I think Days Go By was, like, his song.
[13:10.340 --> 13:11.500]  Days go by.
[13:11.540 --> 13:12.260]  I don't know the rest of it.
[13:12.360 --> 13:13.520]  I was thinking of the...
[13:13.520 --> 13:14.040]  Cameron knows it.
[13:14.080 --> 13:14.660]  Don't worry about it.
[13:14.780 --> 13:17.860]  The Leatherface song, Not a Day Goes By?
[13:17.900 --> 13:18.600]  Ah, no, it's...
[13:18.600 --> 13:18.740]  Nope.
[13:18.940 --> 13:19.140]  No?
[13:19.300 --> 13:19.480]  No.
[13:19.920 --> 13:23.280]  That's different from the Keith Urban song, Days Go By.
[13:23.280 --> 13:25.440]  Is he married to Nicole Kidman still?
[13:25.600 --> 13:26.300]  Yeah, I believe so.
[13:26.380 --> 13:26.720]  That's pretty cool.
[13:26.800 --> 13:27.340]  They're still in love.
[13:27.480 --> 13:27.620]  Yeah.
[13:27.760 --> 13:29.620]  I think they're both Australian and he's short.
[13:30.560 --> 13:30.920]  Nicole...
[13:30.920 --> 13:31.340]  What's her name?
[13:32.300 --> 13:32.660]  Kidman.
[13:32.920 --> 13:33.600]  Nicole Kidman.
[13:33.760 --> 13:34.040]  Uh-huh.
[13:34.360 --> 13:34.820]  Nicole Kidman.
[13:34.980 --> 13:36.000]  Famous for...
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.280]  The jerseys are almost gone?
[13:38.420 --> 13:39.180]  The jerseys are almost gone.
[13:39.260 --> 13:39.440]  Shit.
[13:39.560 --> 13:39.960]  I'm sorry.
[13:40.120 --> 13:40.860]  How many did we sell?
[13:41.200 --> 13:41.620]  I don't know.
[13:41.680 --> 13:42.660]  How many did we have?
[13:42.880 --> 13:43.560]  Like, 10?
[13:43.700 --> 13:44.420]  But how about...
[13:44.420 --> 13:45.560]  Monkey Baseball sold out?
[13:46.380 --> 13:47.900]  He didn't say anything about Monkey Baseball.
[13:48.000 --> 13:48.640]  I'm just assuming.
[13:48.640 --> 13:52.280]  Nicole Kidman, famous for being in BMX Bandits.
[13:52.420 --> 13:53.360]  Probably her greatest role.
[13:53.560 --> 13:59.500]  Nicole Kidman famous for divorcing Tom Cruise and on her way, walking out of signing the papers, dancing in the parking lot.
[13:59.660 --> 14:01.300]  Have you seen BMX Bandits?
[14:01.380 --> 14:01.620]  No.
[14:01.740 --> 14:02.540]  Australian film.
[14:02.640 --> 14:03.400]  She's about 17.
[14:03.940 --> 14:04.980]  It's like rad.
[14:05.860 --> 14:06.700]  Australian rad.
[14:06.820 --> 14:06.960]  Yeah.
[14:07.040 --> 14:07.880]  It's fucking phenomenal.
[14:07.960 --> 14:08.920]  You follow Kevin Bacon on TikTok?
[14:10.460 --> 14:10.940]  Uh...
[14:10.940 --> 14:14.000]  No, but I see him shilling electric cars a lot on TV.
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.960]  So, his TikTok's really cool because he lives on a farm with Keira Sidgwick.
[14:17.200 --> 14:17.400]  Right.
[14:17.400 --> 14:19.500]  And then he's just playing guitar and a goat fights him.
[14:19.900 --> 14:23.840]  But then he was in New York and he just filmed himself and he was looking for...
[14:23.840 --> 14:28.720]  He's like, hey, I heard that there was Quicksilver promotional, like a giant Quicksilver promotional poster somewhere.
[14:29.200 --> 14:29.800]  I saw that.
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.540]  So, he went to one place and looked and then they're like, oh, it's at this place.
[14:32.540 --> 14:34.940]  And he went to another place and then he found it and it's in a bike shop.
[14:34.960 --> 14:37.520]  And he walked in and he's like, hey, I'm looking for this Quicksilver promotion.
[14:37.620 --> 14:39.120]  And the guy went, Kevin Bacon?
[14:39.880 --> 14:40.560]  I saw that.
[14:40.680 --> 14:41.480]  So cool.
[14:41.680 --> 14:42.660]  Well, Quicksilver, have you seen it?
[14:42.660 --> 14:43.200]  It's a great movie.
[14:43.220 --> 14:43.780]  Oh, it's a cool one.
[14:44.020 --> 14:44.920]  It definitely was like...
[14:44.920 --> 14:47.800]  I used to live with like Krusty Bike Punk, so that was like their favorite thing.
[14:48.220 --> 14:50.320]  Yeah, that's a Krusty Bike Punk kind of movie, for sure.
[14:50.980 --> 14:54.360]  Let's open up a pack of Tops 1988 baseball.
[14:54.460 --> 14:55.320]  Let's just see if we can get a Zim.
[14:55.540 --> 14:59.700]  And I'll tell you what right now, if we get a Zim, I'm going to sleeve it and we're going to give it to somebody who bought merch.
[15:00.580 --> 15:01.200]  I love it.
[15:01.560 --> 15:03.320]  We'll give this Zim away.
[15:06.320 --> 15:08.840]  Rafael Ramirez, record breaker Vince Coleman.
[15:09.360 --> 15:09.580]  Okay.
[15:10.020 --> 15:12.880]  Turn back the clock, a picture of Nolan Ryan from a different year.
[15:13.080 --> 15:14.100]  A picture of Nolan Ryan.
[15:14.100 --> 15:20.980]  Matt Young, Dave Anderson, Glenn Wilson, Geoff Ballard, Trash, Tom Neato, Manny Trillo.
[15:21.160 --> 15:22.760]  Oh, we got a...
[15:22.760 --> 15:26.140]  Oh, I thought that was a manager card, but it's just Jack Morris looking like a manager.
[15:26.260 --> 15:26.720]  Oh, cool.
[15:26.980 --> 15:31.720]  Terry Kennedy, Steve Shields, Greg Harris, Dave Vallee, and the manager?
[15:31.980 --> 15:33.120]  Close, Jim England.
[15:33.300 --> 15:33.640]  Hey!
[15:33.660 --> 15:34.300]  Jim Leland, rather.
[15:34.300 --> 15:34.620]  Jim Leland.
[15:34.800 --> 15:35.520]  Jim Leland, rather.
[15:35.980 --> 15:39.280]  Famous Pirates head coach, manager.
[15:39.620 --> 15:41.860]  Let's try 89 Tops next year.
[15:41.860 --> 15:42.240]  Damn.
[15:42.380 --> 15:43.320]  Alright, this one's got a Zim.
[15:43.360 --> 15:43.900]  I can feel it.
[15:44.000 --> 15:44.500]  We'll see.
[15:46.260 --> 15:47.040]  Alright, here we go.
[15:47.300 --> 15:52.020]  Carlos Quintana, Greg Swindell, Gary Carter was an all-star.
[15:52.040 --> 15:52.440]  That's a good one.
[15:52.680 --> 15:56.860]  Louis Salcia, Craig Reynolds, Alan Trammell.
[15:57.620 --> 15:58.300]  Hey, Trammell's good.
[15:58.300 --> 16:01.340]  Alan Trammell seems like somebody you would buy car insurance from.
[16:01.440 --> 16:02.140]  Yeah, he's a regular.
[16:02.140 --> 16:02.800]  Trammell Insurance.
[16:02.920 --> 16:04.500]  Just a normal, regular guy.
[16:04.520 --> 16:05.500]  Come on down to Trammell Insurance.
[16:05.720 --> 16:08.000]  We'll bundle your home and car insurance.
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.100]  Geoff Reardon, trash.
[16:10.320 --> 16:13.940]  Steve Trout, Todd Benzinger.
[16:14.080 --> 16:15.240]  That's a fuckin'...
[16:15.240 --> 16:15.600]  Yeah, that's a...
[16:15.600 --> 16:16.300]  That's a...
[16:16.900 --> 16:18.300]  It's pretty close to a baseball name.
[16:18.480 --> 16:19.260]  I'm gonna...
[16:19.260 --> 16:19.760]  It's a close one.
[16:19.860 --> 16:20.380]  I'm gonna set that aside.
[16:20.380 --> 16:21.440]  That almost seems like a hockey name.
[16:21.740 --> 16:23.960]  Bill Wilkinson, Kurt Ford.
[16:24.480 --> 16:26.080]  Seems like a Ford dealer.
[16:26.380 --> 16:26.540]  Wow.
[16:26.920 --> 16:27.700]  Ozzy Virgil.
[16:27.860 --> 16:28.140]  Uh-huh.
[16:28.500 --> 16:31.320]  Herney Riles, Tom Herr, and Johnny Paredes.
[16:31.400 --> 16:33.340]  No goddamn Zimmer.
[16:33.360 --> 16:36.000]  We're almost down to single digits of the jersey left.
[16:36.260 --> 16:36.600]  Oh, wow.
[16:36.600 --> 16:39.480]  If you're thinking about getting the jersey, you should probably get it now.
[16:39.540 --> 16:40.520]  Because people are gonna go,
[16:40.600 --> 16:42.240]  are you gonna reprint it and let me tell you?
[16:42.300 --> 16:42.740]  I don't know.
[16:43.740 --> 16:44.660]  Um, I have no idea.
[16:45.520 --> 16:47.960]  So you should probably just jump on it and then borrow money from Mom.
[16:48.220 --> 16:48.980]  Borrow money from Mom.
[16:50.000 --> 16:51.340]  Or steal it from her purse.
[16:51.760 --> 16:51.880]  Or...
[16:51.880 --> 16:52.580]  Don't, don't.
[16:52.620 --> 16:55.240]  Or take the TV, sell the TV, buy the TV back.
[16:56.440 --> 16:57.680]  And I think...
[16:57.680 --> 16:59.300]  I've only seen three quarters of that movie,
[16:59.380 --> 17:00.640]  and it seems like it's going well.
[17:00.920 --> 17:01.460]  Oh, man.
[17:01.460 --> 17:02.640]  I had a friend in the Army.
[17:02.840 --> 17:05.560]  Every month, at the end of the month, I would...
[17:05.560 --> 17:07.300]  Or middle of the month, when he'd run out of money,
[17:07.420 --> 17:10.880]  I would drive him to the pawn shop to pawn his VCR.
[17:11.080 --> 17:11.820]  Are you serious?
[17:12.100 --> 17:13.960]  For, like, 30 bucks.
[17:14.380 --> 17:15.580]  And then...
[17:15.580 --> 17:16.400]  Less than 10 jerseys.
[17:16.420 --> 17:17.400]  Less than 10 jerseys left.
[17:17.640 --> 17:19.840]  And then, at the beginning, I'd take him back,
[17:20.040 --> 17:21.840]  and he would buy it back for, like, 45 bucks,
[17:21.880 --> 17:23.220]  and it was just, like, a never-ending cycle
[17:23.220 --> 17:26.120]  of him losing 15 bucks a month off this fucking thing.
[17:27.120 --> 17:28.380]  Let's open up some wrestling cards.
[17:28.460 --> 17:29.760]  Hey, I love it.
[17:30.800 --> 17:31.420]  Very cool.
[17:32.040 --> 17:33.900]  A lot of wrestling going on right now. It's good stuff.
[17:33.900 --> 17:37.220]  There's a guy named Iho Don Vikingo who wrestled last night
[17:37.220 --> 17:40.860]  who did the craziest shit I've ever seen a human man do
[17:40.860 --> 17:42.440]  in, like, a wrestling ring.
[17:42.540 --> 17:42.880]  What did he do?
[17:43.240 --> 17:44.600]  Like, jumped from...
[17:44.600 --> 17:46.660]  He's inside the ring, jumping on a guy to the outside of the ring.
[17:47.060 --> 17:51.080]  He jumps on the middle rope, but on the inside of the ring,
[17:51.520 --> 17:56.300]  to flip over it and do two flips in the air
[17:56.300 --> 17:58.800]  to land on the guy on his back.
[17:58.960 --> 18:01.120]  It's the fucking craziest shit I've ever seen.
[18:01.280 --> 18:01.920]  Did he win the match?
[18:02.020 --> 18:03.620]  No. He, uh...
[18:03.620 --> 18:04.580]  What was the point of it, then?
[18:04.640 --> 18:06.520]  Because that's a superstar-making performance.
[18:06.820 --> 18:07.520]  It's like...
[18:07.520 --> 18:09.500]  Lucha Libre is the future of professional wrestling.
[18:09.500 --> 18:13.140]  It's like, cool, Jalen Brown dropped another 35-8-4,
[18:13.300 --> 18:15.300]  but we still fucking lost because the rest of the team sucked.
[18:15.480 --> 18:17.660]  Mike Trout hits three home runs,
[18:17.940 --> 18:20.840]  Shohei Hotani pitches eight shutout innings,
[18:21.120 --> 18:23.280]  and the Detroit Tigers beat the Angels 8-3.
[18:23.840 --> 18:24.560]  Goddamn, dude.
[18:24.920 --> 18:25.360]  Batista.
[18:25.620 --> 18:27.020]  Hey, that's my friend Batista.
[18:27.240 --> 18:28.840]  That's your friend Batista. You guys are buddies, that's right.
[18:29.040 --> 18:29.280]  Yeah, yeah.
[18:29.800 --> 18:30.680]  Dolph Ziggler.
[18:30.680 --> 18:31.120]  Hey!
[18:31.940 --> 18:33.300]  I think he's on Fox News sometimes.
[18:34.520 --> 18:35.320]  Bianca Belair.
[18:35.360 --> 18:36.780]  She's cool. She's the women's champion right now.
[18:36.860 --> 18:39.880]  Drew McIntyre drops MVP in the VIP lounge.
[18:39.920 --> 18:40.800]  Yeah, he's a scotch.
[18:40.800 --> 18:41.860]  I hope somebody picked it up for him.
[18:43.060 --> 18:45.040]  Undertaker wins the...
[18:46.080 --> 18:46.480]  Tuaig...
[18:46.480 --> 18:47.660]  Tuaig Trophy.
[18:48.080 --> 18:48.520]  Are you okay?
[18:48.600 --> 18:50.740]  2-U-W-A-I-Q. What's that?
[18:51.340 --> 18:53.740]  Oh, I think that was probably in Saudi Arabia or something.
[18:53.840 --> 18:54.180]  Oh, okay.
[18:54.560 --> 18:55.300]  Randy Orton.
[18:55.500 --> 18:56.440]  Hey, it's Randy Orton.
[18:56.520 --> 18:57.360]  He did back surgery.
[18:59.340 --> 19:00.260]  What the fuck?
[19:00.260 --> 19:00.500]  What?
[19:01.740 --> 19:03.680]  King Corbin is forced to eat dog food?
[19:04.820 --> 19:06.560]  I think we should give that one away.
[19:06.620 --> 19:07.220]  He's covered in dog food?
[19:07.220 --> 19:08.280]  I think that should be one of the...
[19:08.280 --> 19:08.520]  That's a giveaway.
[19:08.640 --> 19:09.540]  I think that...
[19:10.880 --> 19:12.060]  That's the worst angle.
[19:12.140 --> 19:12.980]  Can you explain that?
[19:13.200 --> 19:16.900]  He was in an angle where he was... I think he was feuding with Roman Reigns.
[19:17.520 --> 19:18.480]  Who's like the champion.
[19:18.780 --> 19:19.020]  Yeah, yeah.
[19:19.020 --> 19:23.920]  And for some reason it was... they were like humiliating each other.
[19:23.980 --> 19:25.260]  One guy made the other guy eat dog food.
[19:25.400 --> 19:26.020]  It was fucking stupid.
[19:26.100 --> 19:26.920]  Oh my lord.
[19:27.840 --> 19:28.680]  Wrestling's not good.
[19:28.780 --> 19:29.360]  It's just what I watch.
[19:29.360 --> 19:31.420]  That's some Hasselhoff stuff there.
[19:31.500 --> 19:32.200]  Yeah, no kidding.
[19:33.120 --> 19:33.700]  Undertaker.
[19:33.920 --> 19:37.610]  We all remember when he fought AJ Styles in the Boneyard.
[19:37.940 --> 19:38.550]  Boneyard match!
[19:39.120 --> 19:40.100]  Finn Balor.
[19:40.220 --> 19:41.260]  Finn Balor's a cool guy.
[19:41.420 --> 19:41.920]  Finn Balor.
[19:42.540 --> 19:45.400]  Seth Rollins defeats Rey Mysterio.
[19:45.820 --> 19:46.960]  We have five jerseys left?
[19:47.080 --> 19:48.580]  And they're all small.
[19:49.900 --> 19:52.300]  We're almost out of jerseys. Go get it now. Hurry.
[19:52.960 --> 19:57.120]  The Street Profits retain the Raw Tag Team Champion.
[19:57.220 --> 19:58.780]  Way to go. Way to go.
[19:58.780 --> 19:59.300]  You know those dudes?
[19:59.580 --> 20:00.440]  I like the Street Profits, yeah.
[20:00.800 --> 20:01.920]  They still dress that well?
[20:02.300 --> 20:04.400]  Yeah, they're more in a basketball look now.
[20:04.720 --> 20:07.100]  Kind of like the shorts and the jerseys and different looks.
[20:07.260 --> 20:07.600]  Yeah, okay.
[20:07.660 --> 20:07.900]  Pretty cool.
[20:08.320 --> 20:09.740]  British Bulldog. That's from my childhood.
[20:09.880 --> 20:10.880]  Hey, that's a good one right there.
[20:10.960 --> 20:13.700]  That's when he was real roided out.
[20:14.040 --> 20:15.120]  Super cocaine'd up.
[20:15.580 --> 20:16.680]  That's my guy. Fuck yeah.
[20:18.560 --> 20:19.780]  This one scares me a little bit.
[20:20.100 --> 20:20.460]  It's...
[20:20.460 --> 20:21.100]  Oh, Asuka.
[20:21.300 --> 20:22.380]  The girl from Ring, maybe?
[20:22.680 --> 20:23.780]  Asuka's fucking sick.
[20:23.780 --> 20:24.200]  She's bleeding.
[20:24.200 --> 20:25.040]  She's so good.
[20:25.140 --> 20:25.660]  Bleeding green.
[20:25.740 --> 20:26.400]  She's so cool.
[20:26.400 --> 20:30.740]  And then we've got a parallel here of...
[20:30.740 --> 20:34.820]  Elias plays a tune to distract King Corbin.
[20:35.020 --> 20:36.980]  Everyone's doing stuff to King Corbin.
[20:37.340 --> 20:38.400]  Making him eat dog food.
[20:38.520 --> 20:39.780]  Distracting him with music.
[20:40.140 --> 20:40.920]  This poor guy.
[20:41.460 --> 20:43.960]  He's just trying to have a fun match and he's eating dog food.
[20:43.960 --> 20:45.980]  He's over there listening to Free Bird.
[20:46.180 --> 20:47.740]  Next thing he knows, they're shoving dogs...
[20:47.740 --> 20:48.840]  shoving Alpo down his throat.
[20:50.860 --> 20:51.340]  Alright.
[20:52.300 --> 20:53.160]  That was fun.
[20:53.340 --> 20:54.620]  Let's continue along those lines.
[20:54.960 --> 20:56.380]  Now that I'm the UFC guy...
[20:56.380 --> 20:57.640]  We're sold out of jerseys?
[20:57.900 --> 20:58.500]  We're sold out of jerseys.
[20:58.620 --> 21:03.180]  Well, you're gonna have to buy a hat or a baseball bat, I guess.
[21:03.180 --> 21:08.920]  Or Monkey League baseball t-shirt on sale in the Face Jam section, baby.
[21:09.840 --> 21:12.320]  100 bats left, 50 hats left.
[21:12.520 --> 21:14.060]  50 hats, 100 bats left.
[21:14.140 --> 21:14.980]  That's all we got left.
[21:15.040 --> 21:15.240]  Okay.
[21:15.400 --> 21:15.900]  Oh my God.
[21:15.920 --> 21:17.800]  And we bought 100,000 bats.
[21:17.920 --> 21:18.920]  Yeah, there were about 100...
[21:18.920 --> 21:22.540]  Yeah, so this is the opposite of what happens on Face Jam, where you say a lot of things
[21:22.540 --> 21:24.900]  and Michael goes, you better jump on it, we only have seven.
[21:24.900 --> 21:26.600]  And then I have to hear it both ways.
[21:26.760 --> 21:27.720]  And I don't like it.
[21:27.880 --> 21:28.540]  Yeah, it's rough, huh?
[21:28.660 --> 21:28.800]  Yeah.
[21:29.240 --> 21:30.140]  It sucks for me.
[21:30.220 --> 21:31.160]  It sucks to produce.
[21:32.400 --> 21:33.040]  Josh Emmett.
[21:33.860 --> 21:34.660]  Oh, Holly Holmes.
[21:34.720 --> 21:35.420]  She fights this weekend.
[21:35.500 --> 21:35.800]  Oh, cool.
[21:35.940 --> 21:36.340]  She's fighting this weekend.
[21:36.360 --> 21:36.900]  I'll be watching it.
[21:37.000 --> 21:37.220]  Nice.
[21:37.920 --> 21:38.560]  Dan Hooker.
[21:38.960 --> 21:39.820]  Not familiar with him.
[21:41.780 --> 21:42.420]  Bilal Muhammad.
[21:43.400 --> 21:45.120]  That is a lot of UFC cards, bud.
[21:45.200 --> 21:45.540]  Yeah, bud.
[21:45.620 --> 21:46.200]  It's a big pack.
[21:46.260 --> 21:46.740]  It's a hangar pack.
[21:47.220 --> 21:47.860]  Kamaru Uzman.
[21:48.080 --> 21:49.740]  He just fucking lost last weekend.
[21:49.880 --> 21:50.520]  I paid to watch it.
[21:50.560 --> 21:50.860]  It sucked.
[21:51.100 --> 21:51.860]  I'm an Uzman fan.
[21:52.940 --> 21:53.580]  Dustin Poirier.
[21:53.580 --> 21:55.200]  He's still kicking around.
[21:57.000 --> 21:57.880]  Mackenzie Dern.
[21:58.160 --> 22:00.560]  I only like Nate Diaz or Nick Diaz.
[22:00.960 --> 22:02.360]  Nate Diaz is retired, dude.
[22:02.960 --> 22:03.320]  Joe...
[22:03.320 --> 22:04.260]  He can always come back.
[22:04.400 --> 22:05.220]  They always come back.
[22:05.260 --> 22:08.080]  He's in Riverside right now and he's in fighting form and you know it.
[22:08.100 --> 22:09.340]  That late in fighting form.
[22:09.940 --> 22:11.760]  Standing outside a fucking gas station.
[22:12.180 --> 22:14.040]  Waiting for anybody to make eye contact with him.
[22:14.040 --> 22:16.640]  No shirt, extra large hoodie.
[22:18.780 --> 22:19.660]  Frankie Edgar.
[22:21.360 --> 22:22.240]  Cody Garbrandt.
[22:22.820 --> 22:25.780]  Have you ever noticed that the more tattoos a dude has, the worse he is in the UFC?
[22:25.980 --> 22:26.640]  Yeah, usually...
[22:26.640 --> 22:28.600]  I mean, McGregor was kind of like the guy who's...
[22:28.600 --> 22:28.960]  He was an anomaly.
[22:29.120 --> 22:31.400]  There's always an exception to the rule and that would be McGregor.
[22:32.160 --> 22:37.900]  But it seems like the guys who are focused on, I gotta get the tattoos and then I'm getting big and I'm doing these fights.
[22:38.140 --> 22:41.780]  And it's like, you should cut out the first part and just do the rest of it.
[22:41.780 --> 22:44.600]  Yeah, just take that three hours in the tattoo parlor and go lift more weights.
[22:45.000 --> 22:45.120]  Man.
[22:46.160 --> 22:46.880]  There we go.
[22:48.080 --> 22:49.660]  Oh, Paul Craig, rookie.
[22:49.660 --> 22:55.020]  Oh, they even do these dumb parallels called magicians.
[22:55.840 --> 22:56.440]  Magicians?!
[22:56.440 --> 22:58.840]  Speaking of Nate Diaz, there you go.
[22:59.220 --> 23:00.700]  Abracadabra Nate Diaz.
[23:00.840 --> 23:01.560]  That's what I call him.
[23:03.760 --> 23:05.300]  Magician Nate Diaz.
[23:05.580 --> 23:07.520]  He's gonna kick your ass for saying that.
[23:07.800 --> 23:09.380]  You can't put those words together.
[23:09.820 --> 23:12.960]  He's mad at a Raising Canes right now.
[23:14.060 --> 23:15.900]  He's mad at a Raising Canes.
[23:18.440 --> 23:21.120]  Charles Olivier, a craftsman. I've seen him fight. He's good.
[23:22.140 --> 23:24.880]  Oh, Sean O'Malley. I think he's got a title fight coming up here pretty soon.
[23:27.060 --> 23:28.580]  Ketlin Vieira, Green Prison.
[23:28.580 --> 23:29.600]  Oh, that's a... I like the look of that one.
[23:29.600 --> 23:31.000]  Green Parallel, Prison Parallel.
[23:33.020 --> 23:35.260]  Oh, Alexander Volkanovski. He just lost.
[23:35.400 --> 23:36.860]  Saw that fight. That was rough.
[23:38.080 --> 23:40.860]  That was a close fight though. Frankie Edgar. Those are parallels.
[23:41.640 --> 23:43.200]  Then we go...
[23:43.200 --> 23:45.360]  Taya Tuvasa. I've seen him fight a bunch.
[23:47.200 --> 23:48.400]  Sadiq Youssef.
[23:48.660 --> 23:51.400]  Henry Cejudo. I don't know him.
[23:52.020 --> 23:54.040]  Alexi Olenek. I've seen him fight.
[23:55.200 --> 23:56.400]  Rodolfo Vieira.
[23:57.740 --> 23:58.940]  Walt Harris.
[24:01.280 --> 24:02.460]  Oh, Forrest Griffin.
[24:02.880 --> 24:07.700]  There you go. These UFC cards really bang and then miss about 9 or 10 in a row.
[24:09.060 --> 24:11.440]  We're just going to go through these. These are all just base cards.
[24:12.800 --> 24:14.020]  Nothing funny. There you go.
[24:15.660 --> 24:18.900]  Let's move on to something exciting, Eric.
[24:19.240 --> 24:21.160]  How about this?
[24:21.400 --> 24:26.960]  I like this because you started reaching for Russian hockey and it made me go...
[24:26.960 --> 24:29.640]  Nah, we're not going to go that. We're going to go for a little bit of...
[24:30.160 --> 24:31.340]  Are these the Donruss?
[24:32.740 --> 24:34.840]  Donruss Americana Private Signings.
[24:35.280 --> 24:36.740]  These are goofy as shit.
[24:36.740 --> 24:39.100]  These are goofy as shit, buddy. And you know who's in here?
[24:39.220 --> 24:39.520]  Who's that?
[24:40.200 --> 24:41.380]  There's Jackie Chan autographs in here.
[24:41.380 --> 24:41.540]  Whoa!
[24:42.440 --> 24:43.600]  We could be getting...
[24:43.600 --> 24:45.020]  Wait, wait, wait. So we could get...
[24:45.020 --> 24:45.740]  A tuxedo autograph.
[24:45.940 --> 24:46.660]  Oh my god.
[24:47.040 --> 24:50.440]  So wait, would that go in the... hang on...
[24:50.440 --> 24:56.160]  The Face Museum? Only at RTX this July 7th through 9th?
[24:56.200 --> 24:56.560]  You nailed that.
[24:56.560 --> 24:57.600]  In Austin, Texas?
[24:57.780 --> 24:58.320]  You nailed that.
[24:58.340 --> 25:04.900]  Where you can see all the oddities and anomalies from Ripken's Believe It Because Why Not?
[25:04.900 --> 25:08.580]  Like you can see the Keith Urban concert ticket.
[25:08.960 --> 25:10.300]  We're going to have better stuff than that.
[25:10.600 --> 25:11.680]  Well, we'll have Coolio.
[25:12.140 --> 25:14.240]  Will Coolio be there? Hey, a like.
[25:14.580 --> 25:16.480]  If we have a Jackie Chan autograph, that'll be there.
[25:16.820 --> 25:18.460]  Maybe a tuxedo situation.
[25:19.040 --> 25:22.280]  Maybe an original Tiki mug.
[25:23.020 --> 25:25.000]  Some stuff you ain't never seen before.
[25:25.220 --> 25:26.060]  Stuff you ain't never seen.
[25:26.300 --> 25:29.060]  Probably a big ass pink port-a-potty.
[25:29.100 --> 25:32.060]  There might be a big port-a-potty in there that you can take some pics in.
[25:32.140 --> 25:34.740]  Fingers fucking crossed that we get...
[25:34.740 --> 25:35.740]  So anyway, come to RTX.
[25:37.820 --> 25:40.020]  Stacey Cannon from My Two Dads.
[25:40.080 --> 25:40.940]  Don't remember her.
[25:41.080 --> 25:43.700]  What? Wasn't she the girl from My Two Dads?
[25:43.740 --> 25:44.080]  Probably.
[25:44.280 --> 25:45.420]  Do you remember My Two Dads?
[25:45.740 --> 25:46.460]  Oh, that is her.
[25:47.000 --> 25:48.980]  Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right.
[25:49.100 --> 25:49.900]  No, I was trying to trick you.
[25:50.420 --> 25:51.520]  Bonnie... that lady.
[25:52.460 --> 25:54.640]  Oh! Oh! Austin's own.
[25:54.760 --> 25:55.220]  Willie Nelson.
[25:55.540 --> 25:55.900]  Alright!
[25:56.280 --> 25:56.740]  There you go.
[25:58.400 --> 26:00.100]  Ooooooooh! We got a big parallel!
[26:00.100 --> 26:05.460]  We got a press-proof, numbered 68-500,
[26:06.860 --> 26:09.620]  GHW, George Herbert Walker Bush.
[26:09.640 --> 26:12.480]  And just like you were telling me the other day, that's your guy, right?
[26:16.920 --> 26:20.540]  I was talking about Jimmy Carter and you just would not shut up, man.
[26:25.360 --> 26:26.500]  Here's what I'm gonna do.
[26:26.600 --> 26:29.580]  I'm gonna give somebody... somebody in this audience...
[26:29.580 --> 26:30.080]  Wow!
[26:31.200 --> 26:32.900]  ...that bought a jersey or whatever.
[26:33.080 --> 26:36.200]  But if you do get it, Geoff says remember to salute.
[26:36.580 --> 26:39.580]  You're getting the George Herbert Walker Bush parallel. Congratulations.
[26:40.820 --> 26:42.480]  You don't get one of those every day.
[26:42.600 --> 26:42.800]  No.
[26:42.920 --> 26:44.580]  Here's Susie Goldman.
[26:45.040 --> 26:45.480]  Okay.
[26:46.080 --> 26:46.800]  Let's open up some more.
[26:46.860 --> 26:47.360]  Here you go, Susie.
[26:47.840 --> 26:49.180]  Probably won't do the whole blaster box.
[26:49.200 --> 26:49.480]  No.
[26:49.500 --> 26:50.020]  We gotta move on.
[26:50.120 --> 26:50.680]  Oh, man.
[26:50.820 --> 26:51.640]  But, uh...
[26:52.100 --> 26:53.020]  Didn't expect that.
[26:53.200 --> 26:53.960]  George Bush, huh?
[26:53.960 --> 26:54.840]  That Bush banger.
[26:56.240 --> 26:56.680]  Ooooooooh!
[26:56.680 --> 26:57.080]  What do we got?
[26:57.980 --> 26:58.340]  Ooooooooh!
[26:59.040 --> 26:59.400]  Uh...
[26:59.400 --> 27:00.220]  Mitzi Gaynor.
[27:00.360 --> 27:00.720]  Nice!
[27:01.380 --> 27:01.780]  Hell yeah.
[27:02.860 --> 27:03.220]  Ooooooooh!
[27:03.860 --> 27:04.580]  Helen Slater.
[27:04.900 --> 27:05.260]  Dude.
[27:05.700 --> 27:07.600]  Helen Slater was so fucking cool when I was a kid.
[27:07.660 --> 27:08.300]  Who's Helen Slater?
[27:08.760 --> 27:09.840]  It's Kristen Slater's sister.
[27:10.380 --> 27:10.780]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[27:10.780 --> 27:13.560]  And she was in... she was in a movie...
[27:13.560 --> 27:14.040]  Oh!
[27:14.820 --> 27:15.440]  That was her!
[27:15.680 --> 27:21.440]  But she was also in a movie where she and her friends, like, she shaved her head and they went, like, they ran from the law.
[27:21.520 --> 27:22.040]  Boy, that sounds like a...
[27:22.040 --> 27:22.600]  What was that movie called?
[27:22.600 --> 27:23.820]  That sounds like a fucking movie.
[27:23.820 --> 27:24.120]  What was it?
[27:24.960 --> 27:25.880]  Legend of Billie Jean.
[27:25.880 --> 27:27.020]  Legend of Billie Jean.
[27:27.300 --> 27:27.820]  Helen Slater.
[27:28.000 --> 27:28.400]  Thank you.
[27:28.580 --> 27:29.440]  Great fucking film.
[27:30.620 --> 27:31.060]  Uh...
[27:31.060 --> 27:32.360]  Although, uh...
[27:32.360 --> 27:33.820]  Marisol Nichols, I don't think, was in it.
[27:34.680 --> 27:35.120]  Uh...
[27:35.120 --> 27:35.920]  I also don't know who that is.
[27:36.700 --> 27:37.580]  Diane Farr.
[27:37.760 --> 27:38.120]  All the...
[27:38.120 --> 27:39.500]  These cards are insane.
[27:40.000 --> 27:40.940]  Oh, you're gonna like this.
[27:40.940 --> 27:42.620]  These are the craziest cards.
[27:42.820 --> 27:43.880]  These are just people...
[27:44.820 --> 27:48.980]  These are, like, red carpet pictures of just human people.
[27:49.620 --> 27:51.940]  There should be a series of cards called Everyday Americans.
[27:51.940 --> 27:52.100]  Yeah!
[27:52.480 --> 27:55.500]  It's just like, we stopped 15 people at a Walmart and took their photos.
[27:55.500 --> 27:56.780]  Craig Morks.
[27:56.820 --> 27:57.400]  How about this?
[27:57.720 --> 27:59.500]  You ever seen a Brutus the Barber beat cake?
[28:02.120 --> 28:02.760]  He looks...
[28:02.760 --> 28:03.920]  Cut him up, barber!
[28:04.540 --> 28:05.120]  Hell yeah!
[28:05.480 --> 28:05.860]  Great one.
[28:06.000 --> 28:07.180]  The booty man right there.
[28:07.680 --> 28:09.320]  I think that might be one that we send out.
[28:09.500 --> 28:10.480]  Yeah, we definitely...
[28:10.480 --> 28:11.480]  Dude, these cards rule.
[28:11.600 --> 28:12.340]  These are insane.
[28:12.620 --> 28:13.200]  I bought...
[28:13.200 --> 28:14.020]  I have so many more.
[28:14.080 --> 28:14.380]  Really?
[28:14.600 --> 28:15.240]  Yeah, I bought...
[28:15.240 --> 28:16.580]  Oh, we should do this whole box, dude.
[28:16.780 --> 28:17.320]  These are great.
[28:17.580 --> 28:18.160]  I bought...
[28:18.160 --> 28:21.600]  Yeah, I don't know where they are, but I bought a shitload because I really wanted to get that...
[28:21.600 --> 28:22.280]  You want the jacket, too?
[28:22.320 --> 28:23.000]  Yeah, of course, man.
[28:23.720 --> 28:24.040]  Uh...
[28:24.040 --> 28:24.860]  Julie Newmar.
[28:25.000 --> 28:25.660]  Oh, okay.
[28:25.760 --> 28:25.920]  There you go.
[28:26.780 --> 28:26.940]  Uh...
[28:26.940 --> 28:27.120]  Ooh!
[28:28.580 --> 28:31.120]  Red vs. Blue's own...
[28:31.120 --> 28:32.080]  Gus Sirola?
[28:33.340 --> 28:34.200]  Oh, Elijah Wood.
[28:34.240 --> 28:34.680]  Elijah Wood.
[28:34.720 --> 28:35.180]  That was close.
[28:35.340 --> 28:35.840]  He played a character.
[28:36.040 --> 28:36.240]  Yeah.
[28:36.800 --> 28:38.800]  Oh, one of my favorite of all time.
[28:38.900 --> 28:40.340]  One of my comedic inspirations.
[28:40.480 --> 28:40.660]  Mm-hmm.
[28:41.060 --> 28:41.780]  Jonathan Winters.
[28:42.260 --> 28:42.900]  Oh, nice!
[28:43.060 --> 28:43.360]  That's a good one.
[28:43.360 --> 28:43.900]  Big Jonathan Winters fan.
[28:43.920 --> 28:44.020]  Yeah.
[28:45.720 --> 28:46.140]  Uh...
[28:47.400 --> 28:47.820]  Fucking...
[28:47.820 --> 28:48.840]  Natalie Lee.
[28:49.120 --> 28:50.040]  I don't know who she is.
[28:50.180 --> 28:50.400]  Okay.
[28:51.300 --> 28:51.720]  And...
[28:51.720 --> 28:52.020]  Ooh!
[28:54.040 --> 28:54.560]  Uh...
[28:54.560 --> 28:55.460]  Greg Evagan.
[28:56.600 --> 28:58.180]  You know who Greg Evagan is?
[28:58.300 --> 28:58.500]  No.
[28:58.660 --> 28:59.400]  All right, let's find out.
[28:59.620 --> 29:04.720]  Greg Evagan got his start on Broadway singing in Jesus Christ Superstar.
[29:04.780 --> 29:04.920]  Great.
[29:05.100 --> 29:08.400]  And taking the lead role as Danny Zuko in Grease.
[29:08.480 --> 29:08.980]  Oh, boy.
[29:10.040 --> 29:11.200]  We're almost out of hats.
[29:11.500 --> 29:14.140]  You know who else got pretty big on Broadway?
[29:14.640 --> 29:16.660]  Michael Crawford from Condor Man.
[29:17.000 --> 29:17.160]  Oh!
[29:17.160 --> 29:18.880]  And some mothers gotta have them!
[29:19.000 --> 29:19.600]  Oh, God.
[29:19.700 --> 29:21.660]  That was weird to...
[29:21.660 --> 29:22.000]  Oh, God.
[29:22.380 --> 29:23.680]  Watch that after that.
[29:23.820 --> 29:26.520]  I am so excited for that episode to come out.
[29:26.600 --> 29:29.960]  We have already filmed the Condor Man movie to watch, and it was so good.
[29:29.980 --> 29:31.520]  Hey, we'll have Sausage Talk out next week.
[29:31.620 --> 29:32.740]  Sausage Talk 2, by the way.
[29:32.800 --> 29:33.260]  Oh, yeah, Sausage Talk 2.
[29:33.260 --> 29:33.840]  It comes out next week.
[29:34.120 --> 29:34.160]  Yeah.
[29:34.420 --> 29:38.200]  We have more Does It Do out now, but Sausage Talk 2 will be out next week, so...
[29:38.200 --> 29:38.860]  Just FYI.
[29:39.060 --> 29:41.000]  If you're watching this later, then it's probably already out.
[29:42.020 --> 29:45.960]  Eric, you're a big fan of the film The Cursed.
[29:46.040 --> 29:46.280]  I love The Cursed.
[29:46.280 --> 29:49.980]  The bell is round, and no time to fear Lewis Mandelore.
[29:50.300 --> 29:51.980]  Oh, I love Lewis Mandelore.
[29:52.980 --> 29:54.120]  Hector said, yeah, hell yeah.
[29:54.280 --> 29:54.620]  Oh.
[29:55.780 --> 29:56.460]  There you go.
[29:57.140 --> 29:57.900]  It's good to have Hector.
[29:57.940 --> 29:58.300]  Yeah, I know, right?
[29:58.320 --> 29:58.940]  He's good at this.
[30:00.440 --> 30:01.020]  Here we go.
[30:02.860 --> 30:03.580]  America's Sweetheart.
[30:03.700 --> 30:03.880]  Okay.
[30:04.260 --> 30:05.260]  Kathie Lee Gifford.
[30:06.280 --> 30:07.380]  Wife of Frank Gifford.
[30:08.420 --> 30:09.520]  There's that clip...
[30:09.520 --> 30:14.220]  Howard Stern had him on, but Sam the Cooking Guy is a San Diego, like, local TV dude who
[30:14.220 --> 30:15.200]  does, like, cooking and stuff.
[30:15.600 --> 30:19.280]  And then he was the guy that was on with Kathie Lee and Hoda, and he was just like, you have
[30:19.280 --> 30:19.820]  to stop!
[30:19.980 --> 30:20.660]  Shut up!
[30:20.660 --> 30:22.360]  It was awesome.
[30:23.020 --> 30:24.080]  Oh, America's Sweetheart!
[30:24.120 --> 30:24.720]  Gary Coleman!
[30:25.020 --> 30:25.740]  Rest in peace.
[30:25.900 --> 30:30.200]  Gotta say, I was fortunate enough to get to meet him, like, four times at E3.
[30:30.200 --> 30:30.420]  Really?
[30:30.600 --> 30:32.200]  He was always at E3 back in the day.
[30:32.340 --> 30:32.600]  Weird.
[30:32.820 --> 30:33.620]  Yeah, he was always, like...
[30:33.620 --> 30:34.200]  Because he was in that Postal game?
[30:34.540 --> 30:38.280]  He was, like, and then he was dressed up as a security guard once, and, like, he was just
[30:38.280 --> 30:38.920]  always walking around.
[30:39.060 --> 30:39.160]  Weird.
[30:39.260 --> 30:40.140]  And he was always cool.
[30:40.280 --> 30:40.440]  Yeah.
[30:40.520 --> 30:41.660]  Be like, hey, go say hi to Gary Coleman.
[30:41.660 --> 30:42.380]  He was a worker, man.
[30:43.900 --> 30:44.360]  What's the last one?
[30:45.060 --> 30:45.480]  America's Sweetheart.
[30:45.660 --> 30:46.300]  Goldie Hawn.
[30:46.420 --> 30:46.960]  Oh, beautiful.
[30:47.220 --> 30:47.880]  Private Benjamin.
[30:48.220 --> 30:48.820]  Right there.
[30:48.820 --> 30:49.540]  Just the best.
[30:50.260 --> 30:50.580]  That's...
[30:50.580 --> 30:50.840]  Okay.
[30:51.420 --> 30:52.060]  I was just...
[30:52.060 --> 30:53.380]  Private Benjamin was the one that you went to.
[30:53.460 --> 30:53.600]  I don't know.
[30:53.980 --> 30:55.800]  What's the first Goldie Hawn movie that comes to mind?
[30:55.960 --> 30:56.840]  Bird on a Wire.
[30:57.940 --> 30:58.260]  Okay.
[30:59.840 --> 31:00.480]  You go...
[31:00.480 --> 31:01.860]  She's in Laugh-In, wasn't she?
[31:02.100 --> 31:02.800]  She was in Laugh-In.
[31:02.800 --> 31:03.340]  Before my time.
[31:03.700 --> 31:04.340]  Yeah, mine too.
[31:04.700 --> 31:05.480]  First Wives Club.
[31:05.920 --> 31:06.880]  Oh, First Wives Club's a good one.
[31:06.960 --> 31:07.460]  Banger Sisters.
[31:07.680 --> 31:08.320]  Yeah, Banger Sisters.
[31:08.340 --> 31:09.020]  Banger Sisters is a good one.
[31:09.340 --> 31:10.620]  They're old ladies that fuck.
[31:10.720 --> 31:11.600]  They fuck.
[31:11.700 --> 31:12.680]  That's what that was about.
[31:13.520 --> 31:14.780]  Is she still married to Kurt Russell?
[31:14.900 --> 31:16.380]  They never got married, but they are still together.
[31:16.440 --> 31:16.960]  Oh, that's nice.
[31:17.180 --> 31:17.860]  That's so nice.
[31:17.860 --> 31:19.360]  They're super in love.
[31:19.480 --> 31:19.540]  Yeah.
[31:20.060 --> 31:22.720]  She was Mrs. Claus in the movie where he was Santa Claus.
[31:22.820 --> 31:23.740]  I wasn't called Mr. Claus.
[31:23.920 --> 31:27.560]  Speaking of Gary Coleman, another person that I was fortunate enough to meet on multiple
[31:27.560 --> 31:30.360]  occasions who's no longer with us, Peter Mayhew.
[31:30.520 --> 31:30.900]  Oh.
[31:31.760 --> 31:33.520]  What's Mrs. Claus's first name?
[31:36.480 --> 31:37.360]  Marlena Claus.
[31:38.240 --> 31:39.100]  Marlena Claus?
[31:39.260 --> 31:39.780]  I think so.
[31:40.300 --> 31:41.020]  That can't be right.
[31:41.060 --> 31:41.680]  Martha Claus.
[31:42.140 --> 31:43.260]  Oh, Martha Claus sounds right, though.
[31:43.300 --> 31:44.120]  Martha Claus sounds right.
[31:44.640 --> 31:45.960]  This is like an old, like, Martha.
[31:45.960 --> 31:48.480]  Do you think that's how Santa Claus talks?
[31:48.620 --> 31:50.480]  Yeah, when he's pissed off and he's looking for his slippers.
[31:50.720 --> 31:51.100]  When Santa Claus is pissed off.
[31:51.100 --> 31:51.980]  And he doesn't know where they are.
[31:52.140 --> 31:52.620]  When Santa Claus is pissed off.
[31:52.620 --> 31:54.640]  And he's like, I gotta take the cookies out.
[31:54.760 --> 31:55.480]  And he doesn't know where his...
[31:55.480 --> 31:56.720]  Yeah, he gets a little testy.
[31:56.920 --> 31:58.540]  Sounds like the worst improv.
[31:59.640 --> 32:01.060]  It's, oh, Santa Claus is mad.
[32:01.400 --> 32:02.240]  Vicki Lawrence.
[32:02.420 --> 32:02.720]  Oh!
[32:03.500 --> 32:05.920]  Will forever be not Carol Burnett to me.
[32:06.040 --> 32:06.420]  Uh-huh.
[32:07.100 --> 32:07.700]  Close, though.
[32:07.800 --> 32:08.160]  Absolutely.
[32:08.440 --> 32:09.540]  Oh, dude, we gotta fucking...
[32:09.540 --> 32:11.220]  Speaking of Vicki Lawrence, this shit just got good.
[32:11.480 --> 32:12.380]  Greg Grunberg.
[32:13.100 --> 32:14.280]  Oh, it's that guy.
[32:14.280 --> 32:16.940]  He's famous for being J.J. Abrams' best friend.
[32:18.560 --> 32:19.640]  But that's pretty good.
[32:19.860 --> 32:24.100]  Like, you can't knock it because he's in a lot of shit just based on that and that rules.
[32:24.660 --> 32:25.320]  Oh, what you got?
[32:26.580 --> 32:27.320]  What you got?
[32:27.900 --> 32:28.900]  Show me where it squirts.
[32:29.060 --> 32:29.500]  It has to!
[32:31.040 --> 32:31.580]  He's dead.
[32:31.740 --> 32:33.000]  Yeah, it's also not him.
[32:34.940 --> 32:35.700]  Regis Philbin.
[32:35.900 --> 32:36.260]  Oh!
[32:36.860 --> 32:38.080]  And here's a good one.
[32:38.260 --> 32:38.400]  Okay.
[32:38.420 --> 32:39.140]  Here's a really good one.
[32:39.140 --> 32:39.880]  Speaking of Vicki Lawrence.
[32:39.880 --> 32:40.120]  Is it on, like, cardboard?
[32:40.400 --> 32:40.760]  What is this?
[32:40.760 --> 32:43.920]  We got, we got, we got a mem card.
[32:44.340 --> 32:47.240]  We got a Vicki Lawrence TV Stars Mem Card!
[32:47.340 --> 32:47.840]  What is that?
[32:47.920 --> 32:48.320]  That's right.
[32:48.380 --> 32:49.640]  Is it, like, Game War in Jersey?
[32:49.760 --> 32:50.160]  What is that?
[32:50.180 --> 32:52.280]  Yeah, it says, Vicki Lawrence Certificate of Authenticity.
[32:52.440 --> 32:58.920]  This enclosed swatch of material was cut from an item personally worn by Vicki Lawrence.
[32:59.160 --> 32:59.480]  In what?
[32:59.540 --> 33:05.240]  This authentic, personally worn item was obtained and is guaranteed by Donner's Playoffs.
[33:05.580 --> 33:08.680]  So it doesn't say what, but she, whatever that was, she wore it.
[33:09.000 --> 33:09.760]  What was that show?
[33:09.760 --> 33:10.480]  What was that show?
[33:10.840 --> 33:11.240]  Mama's...
[33:11.240 --> 33:11.840]  Mama's Family.
[33:12.000 --> 33:12.220]  Yeah.
[33:12.380 --> 33:13.020]  That's Mama's Family.
[33:13.100 --> 33:13.180]  That's Mama.
[33:13.180 --> 33:16.240]  Which started as a skit on Carol Burnett and then became its own show.
[33:16.460 --> 33:17.600]  Like The Simpsons.
[33:17.900 --> 33:22.360]  One of the funniest Onion articles I ever read was about a dude who got drunk and woke
[33:22.360 --> 33:26.420]  up and realized he'd bought a complete box set of Mama's Family on eBay and was like,
[33:26.480 --> 33:27.000]  I gotta quit drinking.
[33:28.780 --> 33:29.500]  That's awesome.
[33:29.980 --> 33:31.300]  Oh, man, I love that.
[33:31.400 --> 33:32.480]  We're out of jerseys.
[33:32.580 --> 33:33.260]  We still have hats.
[33:33.360 --> 33:34.360]  We still have little green bats.
[33:34.820 --> 33:35.900]  They're almost gone.
[33:36.180 --> 33:37.000]  But, baby...
[33:37.000 --> 33:37.380]  Little green bats.
[33:37.380 --> 33:39.940]  You got MLB Monkey League Baseball shirts.
[33:40.220 --> 33:40.960]  Still in socks.
[33:41.040 --> 33:41.960]  Store.RichTeeth.com.
[33:42.060 --> 33:42.600]  You can check them out.
[33:43.980 --> 33:46.800]  I don't know that we're ever reprinting any of this stuff, so you better jump on it.
[33:47.540 --> 33:49.320]  You, sir, are no Ricardo Montalbán.
[33:49.400 --> 33:49.800]  Hey!
[33:50.380 --> 33:50.820]  That's fun.
[33:51.640 --> 33:52.520]  Oh, here we go.
[33:54.060 --> 33:54.860]  Heywood Nelson.
[33:58.700 --> 33:59.100]  And...
[33:59.900 --> 34:00.700]  Lee Merriweather.
[34:00.840 --> 34:01.160]  Oh, okay.
[34:02.000 --> 34:02.360]  Oh!
[34:04.880 --> 34:05.680]  How about...
[34:06.660 --> 34:07.400]  Branscombe Richmond.
[34:08.040 --> 34:09.540]  The host of Good Morning Hawaii.
[34:09.840 --> 34:11.080]  Did you just...
[34:12.240 --> 34:13.040]  Branscombe Richmond?
[34:13.440 --> 34:13.680]  Yeah.
[34:13.820 --> 34:14.180]  That's cool.
[34:14.260 --> 34:14.840]  He's got cool hair.
[34:14.960 --> 34:15.580]  He does have cool hair.
[34:15.820 --> 34:16.220]  Branscombe!
[34:16.460 --> 34:17.040]  Gray hair, man.
[34:17.360 --> 34:18.060]  Connie Britton.
[34:18.360 --> 34:18.660]  Okay.
[34:19.020 --> 34:19.440]  Oh, wow.
[34:19.500 --> 34:21.080]  She was still somebody even back then.
[34:21.180 --> 34:21.380]  Wait.
[34:23.200 --> 34:24.680]  From Nashville and...
[34:24.680 --> 34:25.260]  What was the movie?
[34:25.320 --> 34:26.440]  My wife was just watching...
[34:26.440 --> 34:28.760]  This Is Where I Leave You is a movie that she's in.
[34:28.980 --> 34:29.360]  And I just...
[34:29.360 --> 34:32.600]  I was thinking, like, oh, I just saw her, like, in something yesterday.
[34:33.220 --> 34:33.720]  Did she...
[34:33.720 --> 34:34.480]  She left somebody?
[34:35.260 --> 34:36.640]  No, she got with somebody.
[34:36.860 --> 34:38.360]  She got with Adam Driver.
[34:39.320 --> 34:39.580]  Oh.
[34:39.760 --> 34:39.940]  Yeah.
[34:40.340 --> 34:41.080]  That didn't work out?
[34:41.300 --> 34:41.560]  Or did it?
[34:41.560 --> 34:42.560]  Well, no, they were like...
[34:42.560 --> 34:43.420]  She was, like, his therapist.
[34:43.640 --> 34:45.100]  He's kind of like a side character thing.
[34:45.440 --> 34:46.080]  Bai Ling, though.
[34:46.180 --> 34:46.520]  Hey!
[34:46.640 --> 34:47.100]  All right.
[34:49.340 --> 34:49.740]  Uh...
[34:51.280 --> 34:52.080]  Brendan Mullally.
[34:53.500 --> 34:54.940]  He was in Mr. Deeds.
[34:57.360 --> 34:57.760]  Okay.
[34:58.260 --> 34:58.580]  Yeah.
[34:59.620 --> 35:00.020]  Uh...
[35:00.020 --> 35:00.680]  He's wearing...
[35:00.680 --> 35:02.000]  He's simply wearing a T-shirt.
[35:02.240 --> 35:02.800]  Gene Harlow.
[35:02.900 --> 35:03.300]  That's all I could afford.
[35:03.300 --> 35:03.540]  Oh, okay.
[35:03.760 --> 35:03.900]  Cool.
[35:05.280 --> 35:05.600]  Uh...
[35:05.600 --> 35:06.600]  Jane Russell.
[35:07.260 --> 35:07.620]  Oh, cool.
[35:07.660 --> 35:08.900]  This is, like, the old Femme Fatale pack.
[35:08.960 --> 35:09.240]  Mm-hmm.
[35:09.440 --> 35:10.480]  And, uh...
[35:10.480 --> 35:11.900]  Yeah, they got the Mr. Deeds guy in there.
[35:12.420 --> 35:16.660]  Do you remember the 1952 film, Comeback, or Little Sheba?
[35:17.140 --> 35:18.020]  Oh, my favorites.
[35:18.040 --> 35:18.420]  Gary Moore.
[35:19.080 --> 35:19.720]  Oh, wow.
[35:19.880 --> 35:20.220]  There you go.
[35:20.660 --> 35:21.040]  Right there.
[35:21.600 --> 35:22.020]  Last pack.
[35:22.080 --> 35:23.220]  Last pack of the Donruss.
[35:23.320 --> 35:23.880]  Last pack magic.
[35:23.980 --> 35:24.720]  I got more somewhere.
[35:24.860 --> 35:25.580]  I love these Donruss.
[35:25.700 --> 35:27.200]  These Donruss cards are, like, insane.
[35:27.340 --> 35:27.700]  I love these.
[35:27.920 --> 35:30.940]  This is, like, when we opened the one, and it was, like, here's a card of a shark.
[35:31.040 --> 35:31.920]  Here's a card of a plane.
[35:32.560 --> 35:33.020]  Oh, yeah.
[35:33.020 --> 35:34.360]  Yeah, those are...
[35:34.360 --> 35:34.720]  Genghis Khan.
[35:34.860 --> 35:35.040]  What?
[35:35.200 --> 35:36.300]  I have a whole box of those.
[35:36.400 --> 35:36.980]  Oh, my God.
[35:37.100 --> 35:37.660]  Oh, I have...
[35:37.660 --> 35:38.120]  I actually...
[35:38.120 --> 35:40.540]  I bought for us a hobby box of those.
[35:40.580 --> 35:41.280]  I didn't bring it today.
[35:41.400 --> 35:41.560]  Uh-huh.
[35:41.640 --> 35:42.660]  So that we can try to get, like...
[35:42.660 --> 35:44.420]  You can get, like, a Nikola Tesla autograph.
[35:44.960 --> 35:46.120]  Like, just weird shit like that.
[35:46.140 --> 35:47.540]  How would you get a Nikola Tesla autograph?
[35:47.720 --> 35:47.920]  That doesn't make any fucking sense.
[35:47.920 --> 35:49.020]  Maybe not him, but, like, people...
[35:49.020 --> 35:49.580]  People like that.
[35:50.000 --> 35:50.920]  Uh, John Cusack.
[35:51.100 --> 35:51.440]  Hey!
[35:51.900 --> 35:52.700]  Gross point blank.
[35:52.900 --> 35:53.260]  There you go.
[35:54.020 --> 35:55.340]  Martin Blank was his name.
[35:55.420 --> 35:55.600]  Mm.
[35:56.160 --> 35:57.560]  And he lived in Gross Point Blank.
[35:57.620 --> 35:59.600]  And, uh, Dan Aykroyd is in that movie.
[35:59.600 --> 36:00.380]  Very weird.
[36:00.600 --> 36:01.100]  He's got...
[36:01.100 --> 36:01.480]  He looks...
[36:01.480 --> 36:03.180]  He looks like, uh, like an IRS guy.
[36:03.260 --> 36:03.940]  He's got, like, the haircut.
[36:04.200 --> 36:04.620]  Yeah, he...
[36:04.620 --> 36:05.240]  But he's, like, an assassin.
[36:05.340 --> 36:05.540]  He is.
[36:05.600 --> 36:07.040]  He's a pretty good assassin, too, but...
[36:07.040 --> 36:09.300]  I don't want to spoil the movie, but things work out pretty well for...
[36:09.300 --> 36:11.000]  John Cusack might be a better assassin.
[36:11.140 --> 36:12.180]  John Cusack and Minnie Driver.
[36:12.420 --> 36:13.880]  Uh, let's just say...
[36:14.320 --> 36:15.620]  What was I watching the other day?
[36:15.660 --> 36:15.980]  Oh!
[36:16.200 --> 36:17.240]  Uh, GoldenEye.
[36:17.260 --> 36:17.680]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[36:17.700 --> 36:19.040]  And Minnie Driver's in it for, like, what...
[36:19.040 --> 36:22.840]  She's, like, an Eastern European Dolly Parton singing thing, and it's very weird.
[36:22.860 --> 36:23.620]  Yeah, it's super weird.
[36:23.620 --> 36:25.860]  She was, like, I took this job because I had no money.
[36:26.940 --> 36:30.000]  Another iconic American, huge television star.
[36:30.380 --> 36:31.240]  Big fan, Niecy Nash.
[36:31.260 --> 36:32.040]  Oh, Niecy Nash!
[36:32.040 --> 36:32.540]  Very cool.
[36:32.620 --> 36:34.240]  Continues to kill it on TV.
[36:34.360 --> 36:37.960]  She is, like, in more and more stuff that is more and more prominent.
[36:38.240 --> 36:38.800]  Good for her.
[36:38.900 --> 36:42.620]  I did an upfront a couple years ago, and she...
[36:43.320 --> 36:43.860]  In, like, the little...
[36:43.860 --> 36:45.920]  It was where I saw Shaq, and I didn't talk to him.
[36:46.200 --> 36:48.840]  She was there, too, and it was also very cool to be in the same room as her.
[36:48.900 --> 36:49.300]  That's awesome.
[36:49.340 --> 36:49.580]  Big fan.
[36:50.840 --> 36:51.200]  Uh...
[36:51.200 --> 36:51.820]  Oh, here we go.
[36:52.760 --> 36:53.480]  Jake LaMotta.
[36:54.200 --> 36:54.560]  Oh!
[36:54.980 --> 36:55.640]  There you go.
[36:56.120 --> 36:59.580]  Ooh, and even better, maybe, is Martin Cove.
[37:01.940 --> 37:05.100]  You might remember him from The Karate Kid.
[37:05.480 --> 37:06.140]  Oh, okay.
[37:06.240 --> 37:06.560]  He's the bad guy.
[37:06.660 --> 37:07.320]  Oh, he is the bad guy.
[37:07.340 --> 37:08.040]  He's the Cobra Kai guy.
[37:08.280 --> 37:09.720]  Is he in the new Cobra Kai?
[37:10.220 --> 37:11.100]  Yeah, I believe he is.
[37:11.560 --> 37:12.980]  I don't watch it, so I was curious.
[37:14.160 --> 37:15.340]  Let's continue down that vein.
[37:15.500 --> 37:15.660]  Okay.
[37:15.740 --> 37:17.280]  I got something else that's very unique for you.
[37:17.440 --> 37:20.660]  I was excited to show it on the big show with everybody else, but...
[37:20.660 --> 37:24.660]  I bought us a box of 2022 historic autographs.
[37:25.360 --> 37:25.620]  What?
[37:25.720 --> 37:27.640]  Eric, we could be getting...
[37:27.640 --> 37:28.380]  Here's what we get.
[37:29.060 --> 37:32.420]  We could have a shipwreck relic redemption card.
[37:32.840 --> 37:36.040]  We could get a historic DNA hair card.
[37:37.080 --> 37:38.940]  We should get a Victorian pinup.
[37:39.120 --> 37:40.280]  We shouldn't have any of these things.
[37:41.380 --> 37:42.600]  We could get...
[37:42.600 --> 37:43.280]  I mean, there are autographs.
[37:43.280 --> 37:44.700]  These things should be in a museum.
[37:45.880 --> 37:46.400]  It should be in a box.
[37:46.400 --> 37:47.680]  We could learn about...
[37:47.680 --> 37:56.320]  The 330 card set includes Robber Barons, Railroads, Monopolies, Industrialization, Yellow Journalism, Immigration, The Titanic, The Gold Rush, Manifest Destiny.
[37:57.540 --> 38:07.360]  Autographs include Ty Cobb, Rockefeller, Lind, Dickens, Edison, Reese, Vanderbilt, Queen Victoria, and Presidents Cleveland, Hoover, Taft, and McKinney.
[38:07.460 --> 38:08.300]  No Bush for you, though?
[38:08.420 --> 38:08.760]  No Bush.
[38:08.840 --> 38:09.200]  Oh, no.
[38:10.400 --> 38:11.840]  23 hats, 83 bats.
[38:11.920 --> 38:12.660]  Oh, my God!
[38:12.660 --> 38:13.920]  23 hats, 83 bats.
[38:13.960 --> 38:14.560]  Oh, my God.
[38:14.660 --> 38:16.320]  The bats are not flying off the shelves.
[38:16.320 --> 38:18.020]  I think we had way more bats than we did jerseys.
[38:18.100 --> 38:18.420]  Yes.
[38:18.720 --> 38:20.400]  Well, hey, thank you for buying these so far.
[38:20.540 --> 38:22.960]  I told Hector before this, there's no way any of this is selling out.
[38:24.680 --> 38:25.980]  Really, really appreciate your support.
[38:26.040 --> 38:27.680]  I hope you're having a good time watching us open cards.
[38:27.880 --> 38:28.000]  Yeah.
[38:28.020 --> 38:30.200]  I'm excited to sleeve some of these and send them to you.
[38:30.260 --> 38:32.360]  Maybe you'll get a Vicky Lawrence Mem Card.
[38:33.020 --> 38:35.280]  And if you're not having a good time, keep watching.
[38:35.420 --> 38:35.760]  You might.
[38:36.180 --> 38:36.940]  Yeah, you never know.
[38:37.980 --> 38:38.740]  Let's see what this...
[38:38.740 --> 38:40.360]  This might be where it all turns around for you.
[38:40.420 --> 38:40.980]  I've never gotten a...
[38:40.980 --> 38:41.760]  What the...
[38:41.760 --> 38:42.420]  A book.
[38:42.500 --> 38:45.640]  Is this a fucking Legend of Zelda instruction guide for this thing, or what?
[38:46.440 --> 38:47.460]  Ooh, here we go.
[38:47.560 --> 38:49.840]  Here's the 21st pack, Gilded Age.
[38:52.000 --> 38:53.160]  Let's open like...
[38:53.160 --> 38:53.740]  Let's just see.
[38:53.900 --> 38:54.220]  Let's see.
[38:55.320 --> 38:56.500]  Eric, let's just see what's up.
[38:57.020 --> 38:57.620]  I'm gesture.
[38:57.720 --> 38:58.080]  Whatever.
[38:58.240 --> 38:58.580]  Here we go.
[38:58.880 --> 38:59.780]  First pack.
[39:01.340 --> 39:02.060]  Ten cards.
[39:02.220 --> 39:02.660]  Ten cards.
[39:03.120 --> 39:03.660]  Gilded Age.
[39:05.180 --> 39:05.680]  I'm looking...
[39:05.680 --> 39:06.260]  No idea what's...
[39:06.260 --> 39:08.760]  I'm looking for Queen Victoria Otto on card.
[39:08.880 --> 39:09.500]  Yeah, I want Edison.
[39:09.700 --> 39:09.840]  Yeah.
[39:09.960 --> 39:10.460]  Ooh, nice.
[39:11.500 --> 39:11.920]  We're getting...
[39:11.920 --> 39:13.100]  I can...
[39:13.100 --> 39:13.680]  I can feel it.
[39:13.720 --> 39:14.800]  We're getting the tie call in parallel.
[39:14.800 --> 39:17.220]  First card out the gate, Wealth Disparity.
[39:17.500 --> 39:18.920]  This pack sucks.
[39:19.180 --> 39:20.260]  Here's the Baramores.
[39:21.220 --> 39:22.180]  This is...
[39:22.180 --> 39:22.900]  Oh, here you go.
[39:23.040 --> 39:23.840]  The Baker Bowl.
[39:24.160 --> 39:26.080]  This is not good.
[39:26.200 --> 39:26.520]  You get...
[39:26.520 --> 39:28.480]  Do you remember the Sherman Antitrust Act?
[39:29.720 --> 39:30.740]  Oh, fuck, dude.
[39:31.160 --> 39:31.840]  It's got a 101.
[39:33.240 --> 39:34.020]  I'm not even kidding.
[39:34.420 --> 39:37.780]  Here's the Fisk University Jubilee Singers.
[39:38.040 --> 39:39.260]  I'll open that one last.
[39:39.920 --> 39:41.540]  Oh, here are the Robber Barons.
[39:41.760 --> 39:42.600]  They were on the cover.
[39:43.000 --> 39:44.640]  What the fuck is going on?
[39:44.640 --> 39:45.980]  Here's a Renoir.
[39:46.540 --> 39:46.980]  What?
[39:47.940 --> 39:48.820]  Marshall Fields.
[39:49.960 --> 39:51.100]  It's a building.
[39:51.620 --> 39:52.460]  Here's a picture of...
[39:52.460 --> 39:53.880]  We all remember Coxsey's Army.
[39:55.080 --> 39:56.840]  Dude, you're gonna fucking flip.
[39:57.700 --> 39:58.900]  I gotta see if I can read this.
[39:59.540 --> 40:01.620]  We got a yellow printing plate.
[40:01.880 --> 40:03.000]  Oh, my God.
[40:03.360 --> 40:04.100]  Harlow's autograph.
[40:04.260 --> 40:07.720]  So, this is a printing plate from the actual card, which makes this a one of one.
[40:07.900 --> 40:08.220]  Uh-huh.
[40:09.020 --> 40:11.220]  Although, I don't know that it actually says stamped on one of one.
[40:11.220 --> 40:12.360]  It is...
[40:14.200 --> 40:14.580]  from...
[40:15.050 --> 40:16.500]  the first Groundhog Day.
[40:17.940 --> 40:20.180]  We got a one of one Groundhog.
[40:20.380 --> 40:21.400]  Yellow printing plate.
[40:21.760 --> 40:22.480]  Look at that.
[40:22.640 --> 40:22.900]  Isn't that cool?
[40:22.900 --> 40:24.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got it!
[40:24.720 --> 40:25.600]  Hell, yeah!
[40:25.860 --> 40:26.520]  Printing plates are cool.
[40:26.600 --> 40:27.540]  I got a couple of Marcus Smarts.
[40:27.600 --> 40:28.700]  I got a Randi Rosarino.
[40:28.960 --> 40:29.800]  Oh, man.
[40:29.960 --> 40:30.390]  But I don't have...
[40:31.280 --> 40:32.440]  I don't think I can give this away.
[40:32.560 --> 40:34.100]  I think that this is precious for me.
[40:34.140 --> 40:35.320]  No, that might be...
[40:35.320 --> 40:36.320]  That's a...
[40:37.580 --> 40:41.540]  That's a legitimate first Groundhog Day Groundhog printing plate.
[40:41.700 --> 40:42.300]  Wow.
[40:43.420 --> 40:44.760]  Wow, what a day.
[40:45.600 --> 40:48.340]  First Vicky Lawrence's clothes, and now...
[40:49.080 --> 40:50.980]  Now the first Groundhog Day.
[40:51.040 --> 40:51.840]  Remember Henry Ford?
[40:52.180 --> 40:52.580]  Oh, yeah.
[40:52.880 --> 40:54.680]  Remember Mike King Kelly?
[40:54.900 --> 40:55.200]  Okay.
[40:55.420 --> 40:56.480]  You're a big baseball fan.
[40:56.600 --> 40:57.480]  Yeah, I love Boston.
[40:58.100 --> 41:00.120]  Gustavus Franklin Swift Jr.
[41:01.020 --> 41:02.580]  I'm a big fan of Senior, but...
[41:02.580 --> 41:04.400]  The old Sears and Roebucks.
[41:05.680 --> 41:06.080]  Roebucks?
[41:06.100 --> 41:07.700]  Alice Roosevelt Longworth.
[41:07.860 --> 41:08.740]  Oh, look at that dog, though.
[41:08.800 --> 41:10.380]  Do you remember a Pullman car?
[41:11.280 --> 41:13.440]  How about the McCormick Harvester?
[41:13.480 --> 41:15.200]  The only thing I've liked so far is that dog one time.
[41:15.520 --> 41:16.860]  Everybody loves Ginny Lind.
[41:17.920 --> 41:18.600]  Oh, here we go.
[41:19.120 --> 41:19.520]  Ooh!
[41:21.520 --> 41:22.540]  This is cool.
[41:22.920 --> 41:24.500]  Do you know who H.H. Holmes is?
[41:25.020 --> 41:25.540]  I do.
[41:25.720 --> 41:26.040]  Who's that?
[41:26.040 --> 41:26.760]  I read a book about him.
[41:26.920 --> 41:28.780]  He was the first American serial killer.
[41:30.240 --> 41:32.940]  He killed people during the Chicago World's Fair.
[41:33.200 --> 41:34.160]  It was a H.H. Holmes card.
[41:34.160 --> 41:35.800]  You can probably learn all about how he murdered people.
[41:35.940 --> 41:37.140]  He had like a murder house.
[41:37.300 --> 41:37.960]  Oh, that's fun.
[41:38.300 --> 41:39.080]  That's fun for him.
[41:39.700 --> 41:40.640]  He got away with it for a long time.
[41:40.720 --> 41:41.420]  N.C. Wyeth?
[41:42.200 --> 41:43.180]  Let's see what else we got.
[41:43.460 --> 41:45.640]  You think he was happy to know that he was the first one?
[41:47.020 --> 41:48.720]  I think he was happy to... yeah.
[41:49.080 --> 41:49.360]  Okay.
[41:49.500 --> 41:49.940]  I think so.
[41:50.020 --> 41:51.700]  Everybody wants to be first at something.
[41:51.960 --> 41:52.300]  Right.
[41:52.660 --> 41:53.420]  Kathy Lee Bates.
[41:53.760 --> 41:54.760]  But a different one.
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.380]  It's Catherine Lee Bates, not Kathy Lee Bates from Misery.
[42:00.640 --> 42:01.540]  She was an author, though.
[42:02.140 --> 42:03.040]  I wonder if there's any relation.
[42:03.040 --> 42:04.040]  Yeah, definitely.
[42:04.480 --> 42:04.920]  Frank Lloyd Wright.
[42:06.260 --> 42:06.960]  Love him.
[42:07.880 --> 42:09.260]  To live in one of those homes, huh?
[42:09.600 --> 42:10.700]  Standard Time Zones.
[42:11.240 --> 42:11.620]  What?
[42:11.640 --> 42:12.440]  Here's a copy of the...
[42:12.440 --> 42:13.320]  Wait, what the fuck?
[42:13.320 --> 42:14.400]  Yeah, do you want to know what the time zones are?
[42:14.560 --> 42:15.960]  Standard Time Zones?
[42:17.400 --> 42:17.800]  What?
[42:17.980 --> 42:19.820]  Pacific, Mountain, Central, and Eastern.
[42:20.920 --> 42:23.280]  Wall Street Journal, if you want to read a newspaper.
[42:23.440 --> 42:24.780]  What the fuck are these cards?
[42:24.920 --> 42:26.820]  Do you guys remember commercial electricity?
[42:28.000 --> 42:29.260]  How about the Copper King?
[42:29.360 --> 42:31.860]  This is like a pack of concepts.
[42:31.860 --> 42:33.860]  Everybody loves Dr. Pepper.
[42:34.620 --> 42:36.060]  What? Yeah! Yeah!
[42:36.580 --> 42:37.820]  Here you go, Joseph Pulitzer.
[42:38.280 --> 42:39.340]  He's the first prize winner.
[42:39.840 --> 42:40.520]  They named it after him.
[42:40.760 --> 42:41.400]  Winslow Homer.
[42:42.340 --> 42:44.860]  And then, ooh, we have some sort of a prism.
[42:46.780 --> 42:49.840]  Jacob Reese, who was a journalist.
[42:51.760 --> 42:53.900]  Learn all about him if you're one of the ten.
[42:54.080 --> 42:55.520]  Who gets one of these cards.
[42:56.760 --> 42:58.520]  We'll figure out at the end what we're going to give away.
[42:58.640 --> 42:59.500]  This is truly insane.
[42:59.520 --> 43:01.000]  This might be the autograph pack right here.
[43:01.000 --> 43:02.040]  Hobby 5 card.
[43:02.300 --> 43:03.540]  Feeling good about this one?
[43:03.720 --> 43:04.360]  This is the banger.
[43:05.080 --> 43:07.840]  The other ones have all been lead-ups just to this.
[43:07.920 --> 43:14.140]  If we get something better than the first Groundhog Day printing plate, I can't.
[43:14.460 --> 43:15.020]  I don't even know what this is.
[43:15.020 --> 43:15.520]  Yeah, I don't know.
[43:15.760 --> 43:16.120]  Oh, shit.
[43:16.380 --> 43:17.500]  Right off the bat, huh?
[43:17.820 --> 43:19.220]  ZBD Transformer.
[43:19.660 --> 43:21.960]  Damn, look at that.
[43:22.720 --> 43:23.480]  Is that cool?
[43:23.680 --> 43:24.300]  Yeah, man.
[43:25.500 --> 43:27.120]  Fucking Scott Joplin.
[43:27.840 --> 43:29.920]  Yeah, what's up?
[43:29.920 --> 43:30.920]  Gold Prism.
[43:33.400 --> 43:33.920]  JCPenney.
[43:36.960 --> 43:39.260]  Do you remember when we got Wealth Disparity earlier?
[43:39.580 --> 43:41.980]  How would you like it in blue?
[43:42.460 --> 43:44.620]  Blue Wealth Disparity right there for you.
[43:45.260 --> 43:48.200]  We got JCPenney in parallel!
[43:48.380 --> 43:49.160]  That's not it.
[43:49.220 --> 43:51.040]  We also got a purple parallel.
[43:51.900 --> 43:52.880]  Metropolitan Opera.
[43:53.000 --> 43:53.920]  Oh, my God.
[43:54.080 --> 43:56.020]  These cards are fucking bizarre.
[43:56.140 --> 43:57.540]  I'm going to open one more pack of these.
[43:57.580 --> 43:58.640]  Oh, my God.
[43:58.780 --> 43:59.280]  Too weird.
[43:59.280 --> 43:59.860]  Here it is.
[44:00.620 --> 44:01.240]  All right.
[44:02.020 --> 44:03.220]  So fucking weird.
[44:03.720 --> 44:04.920]  These are so weird.
[44:05.140 --> 44:05.240]  Pretty fucking weird.
[44:05.240 --> 44:06.000]  It's pretty fucking weird.
[44:06.000 --> 44:06.900]  We gotta do these more often.
[44:07.080 --> 44:07.240]  Yeah.
[44:07.980 --> 44:08.760]  Black Friday.
[44:08.960 --> 44:09.820]  That was a bad day.
[44:10.660 --> 44:11.820]  Great Blizzard of 1888.
[44:12.440 --> 44:13.640]  I have no memory of it.
[44:14.060 --> 44:14.880]  Just missed it.
[44:15.060 --> 44:15.960]  Jules Verne.
[44:16.140 --> 44:16.460]  Okay.
[44:17.740 --> 44:18.540]  Lord Stanley.
[44:19.100 --> 44:19.800]  The cup guy?
[44:20.060 --> 44:21.280]  Yeah, look at how big that fucking cup is.
[44:21.340 --> 44:21.580]  Huge.
[44:21.620 --> 44:21.920]  Too big.
[44:22.000 --> 44:22.160]  It's huge.
[44:22.840 --> 44:23.440]  Too big.
[44:23.560 --> 44:24.220]  Oh, shit, dude.
[44:24.620 --> 44:25.020]  No.
[44:26.640 --> 44:27.760]  Moses Fleetwood Walker.
[44:27.760 --> 44:29.740]  I want you to pull one and it's Don Zimmer.
[44:30.000 --> 44:30.700]  Coca-Cola.
[44:30.840 --> 44:31.780]  Dude, how cool would that be?
[44:32.000 --> 44:32.220]  Nuts.
[44:32.920 --> 44:33.720]  Carlo Collodi.
[44:35.040 --> 44:35.960]  Almost Don Zimmer.
[44:36.760 --> 44:37.760]  It's like a...
[44:39.480 --> 44:40.280]  What's that kid's name?
[44:41.200 --> 44:41.600]  Pinocchio?
[44:42.260 --> 44:43.060]  That kid?
[44:43.140 --> 44:43.880]  Stepping Switch.
[44:44.040 --> 44:44.660]  He was a kid, right?
[44:44.700 --> 44:45.460]  That's how you think of Pinocchio?
[44:45.460 --> 44:46.040]  He was a kid.
[44:46.540 --> 44:47.600]  Who's that fucking kid?
[44:48.200 --> 44:50.260]  Win the Latimer Miners Massacre.
[44:50.560 --> 44:50.820]  Oof.
[44:51.460 --> 44:52.920]  These cards are insane.
[44:53.100 --> 44:55.720]  They're cool because they're pretty and you get to learn about stuff.
[44:55.720 --> 44:58.080]  I don't want either one of those.
[44:58.100 --> 45:01.680]  You get to learn about stuff like who's your favorite Russian hockey player?
[45:01.920 --> 45:02.300]  Is this... wait.
[45:02.700 --> 45:03.220]  I hate these.
[45:03.500 --> 45:09.520]  Is this the Russian or the Finnish or Norwegian?
[45:09.640 --> 45:10.080]  I don't remember.
[45:10.320 --> 45:13.760]  These might be... this is Svenska.
[45:14.280 --> 45:15.160]  Yeah, this is the...
[45:15.160 --> 45:16.000]  Yeah, they're not Russian.
[45:16.000 --> 45:30.100]  We got David Rundblad, Nicholas Sundstrom, Victor Lindgren, Pekka Saravo, David Frederiksen, and Marcus Holtet.
[45:30.200 --> 45:30.820]  There you go.
[45:31.760 --> 45:35.260]  Icons of the... wherever that is.
[45:35.460 --> 45:36.980]  Show me the printing press one more time.
[45:37.260 --> 45:37.800]  If you'd like.
[45:38.040 --> 45:39.660]  Don't tempt me with a good time.
[45:40.100 --> 45:41.940]  How about we do this?
[45:42.100 --> 45:42.320]  Okay.
[45:43.200 --> 45:44.420]  World Cup just happened.
[45:44.600 --> 45:44.920]  Okay.
[45:44.920 --> 45:46.720]  Why don't we open some soccer cards?
[45:47.300 --> 45:48.100]  I guess.
[45:49.500 --> 45:51.000]  Who are you going to know from this?
[45:52.500 --> 45:53.180]  Kylian Mbappe?
[45:57.700 --> 45:58.500]  I'll know...
[45:59.100 --> 46:00.120]  I'll know, we'll see.
[46:00.500 --> 46:03.260]  Who are the five most popular players in the world?
[46:03.340 --> 46:04.300]  Let's see, I might know them.
[46:04.520 --> 46:04.680]  Yeah.
[46:04.880 --> 46:05.420]  Oh boy.
[46:06.920 --> 46:07.320]  Pelé.
[46:07.480 --> 46:08.400]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:08.900 --> 46:09.300]  Miradonna.
[46:09.580 --> 46:10.220]  He'll probably be in here.
[46:10.280 --> 46:11.180]  Rest in peace also, I think.
[46:11.400 --> 46:11.860]  Yeah, he's dead.
[46:13.220 --> 46:14.580]  Okay, let's see who we got here.
[46:15.120 --> 46:15.980]  Who we got?
[46:16.660 --> 46:17.680]  Steven, that guy.
[46:18.140 --> 46:20.760]  We got a rookie, Yudanaka Yama.
[46:21.160 --> 46:21.300]  Okay.
[46:21.420 --> 46:24.160]  Oh, we got a silver prism of Nicolas Gonzalez.
[46:24.620 --> 46:24.900]  Okay.
[46:25.060 --> 46:26.460]  And then Eric Garcia.
[46:27.380 --> 46:28.960]  That's all the cards that are in that pack?
[46:29.060 --> 46:30.160]  Yeah, that's all that were in that pack.
[46:30.260 --> 46:30.640]  Oh boy.
[46:30.780 --> 46:31.800]  Let's see how many are in this one.
[46:31.880 --> 46:33.120]  I think it's probably the same number.
[46:33.260 --> 46:34.160]  I think you're probably right.
[46:35.740 --> 46:37.480]  Oh, I'm going to take that silver pair alone.
[46:41.140 --> 46:42.100]  Adrian, that guy.
[46:42.800 --> 46:43.680]  Maddie, that guy.
[46:46.480 --> 46:47.640]  14 hats left?
[46:47.920 --> 46:48.960]  Oh, that's not a lot of hats, guys.
[46:48.960 --> 46:50.200]  Silver parallel of global reach.
[46:50.340 --> 46:51.560]  Felipe Coutinho.
[46:51.800 --> 46:52.420]  That's a cool card.
[46:53.300 --> 46:54.580]  And Harris Seferovic.
[46:55.860 --> 46:56.700]  All right, there you go.
[46:57.900 --> 47:00.200]  What do you want to open next?
[47:00.420 --> 47:00.620]  I don't know.
[47:00.640 --> 47:01.180]  What do you got, man?
[47:01.440 --> 47:01.860]  How about this?
[47:02.160 --> 47:05.600]  In honor of, in recognition of baseball, starting, opening day.
[47:06.000 --> 47:06.800]  Recognition of baseball.
[47:07.060 --> 47:10.580]  Let's start, let's open up a box I've been holding onto for a long time.
[47:12.720 --> 47:13.670]  Not quite today's.
[47:13.670 --> 47:16.270]  How about 1997's Baseball Stars?
[47:16.430 --> 47:17.110]  Is that...
[47:17.110 --> 47:17.990]  That's Ken Griffey Jr.
[47:18.090 --> 47:20.050]  Is that Team USA's hitting coach, Ken Griffey Jr.?
[47:20.050 --> 47:22.510]  That is Team USA's hitting coach, Ken Griffey Jr.
[47:22.550 --> 47:23.830]  We'll open three packs of that.
[47:24.950 --> 47:29.790]  Mark DeRosa managing that team was pretty fun to watch because he had no idea what the fuck he was doing.
[47:30.050 --> 47:33.070]  But he was trying to, he's like, I can be a manager.
[47:33.530 --> 47:35.390]  And quickly found out he could not.
[47:36.170 --> 47:36.890]  Oh, yeah.
[47:37.250 --> 47:37.590]  97.
[47:38.310 --> 47:38.570]  Let's see.
[47:38.670 --> 47:39.170]  Here we go.
[47:39.270 --> 47:39.630]  What do we got?
[47:40.310 --> 47:42.550]  First off, we got the big show right there.
[47:42.730 --> 47:43.410]  Berto Alomar.
[47:43.410 --> 47:44.130]  Oh, nice.
[47:44.350 --> 47:44.950]  A little parallel.
[47:45.190 --> 47:45.990]  That's a good looking one card.
[47:47.130 --> 47:47.930]  Kevin Apier.
[47:48.190 --> 47:48.430]  Okay.
[47:49.910 --> 47:50.710]  Lyle Mouton.
[47:50.890 --> 47:52.510]  I was not watching baseball in 1997.
[47:52.530 --> 47:52.870]  Oh, really?
[47:52.910 --> 47:53.810]  So I'm not going to know.
[47:54.290 --> 47:55.330]  Chris Hoyles.
[47:55.470 --> 47:56.510]  A lot of these dudes.
[47:57.250 --> 47:59.090]  I do know Alex Rodriguez and Tony Gwynn.
[47:59.170 --> 48:02.330]  You do know both of the most popular players of the 90s.
[48:02.790 --> 48:04.570]  Do you know...
[48:05.850 --> 48:06.650]  Jose Panigua?
[48:07.650 --> 48:08.790]  He's an expo, so no.
[48:08.830 --> 48:10.890]  Ooh, Yvonne Rodriguez, all-star card.
[48:10.890 --> 48:11.870]  All right, there's Big Pudge.
[48:11.990 --> 48:12.150]  Yeah.
[48:13.410 --> 48:14.890]  I think he was a first ballot hall of famer.
[48:15.170 --> 48:15.910]  I believe you're right.
[48:16.830 --> 48:17.690]  Ooh, god damn.
[48:17.770 --> 48:19.150]  These things are stuck together, of course.
[48:19.330 --> 48:20.270]  Geoff Supan.
[48:20.430 --> 48:20.670]  Okay.
[48:23.290 --> 48:25.650]  Scott Carl doing the importance of stretching.
[48:25.750 --> 48:27.290]  That is very important, especially in 1997.
[48:27.430 --> 48:28.850]  Probably give that card away.
[48:29.030 --> 48:29.950]  That's a good one.
[48:30.270 --> 48:30.990]  Jermaine Dye.
[48:31.310 --> 48:31.710]  Nice.
[48:31.810 --> 48:32.290]  I like Jermaine Dye.
[48:32.350 --> 48:33.170]  He played for the White Sox for a while.
[48:33.550 --> 48:35.170]  And then rookie, Willie Adams.
[48:35.490 --> 48:35.830]  Nice.
[48:36.170 --> 48:36.650]  There you go.
[48:37.790 --> 48:38.930]  Let's open two more packs of that.
[48:38.950 --> 48:39.230]  Okay.
[48:39.890 --> 48:42.650]  These are the hottest players in 1997.
[48:42.650 --> 48:44.210]  These are the players.
[48:44.390 --> 48:44.610]  The who's who.
[48:44.710 --> 48:46.170]  No, these are just the players in 1997.
[48:46.350 --> 48:47.390]  The who's who.
[48:47.490 --> 48:48.250]  It's just the players.
[48:48.970 --> 48:50.130]  We got ten minutes left.
[48:50.290 --> 48:51.110]  We got ten minutes left.
[48:51.110 --> 48:51.330]  That's it.
[48:51.390 --> 48:51.990]  We better get to it.
[48:52.550 --> 48:53.590]  Another big show card.
[48:53.670 --> 48:54.330]  This one's Craig Biggio.
[48:54.510 --> 48:54.910]  Nice.
[48:55.110 --> 48:56.170]  Biggio's a good-looking man.
[48:56.170 --> 48:56.450]  Yeah, there you go.
[48:56.450 --> 48:57.110]  That's a good card.
[48:57.270 --> 48:57.770]  Good-looking card.
[49:00.830 --> 49:01.630]  Carlos Baerga.
[49:02.490 --> 49:03.290]  Raul Mondesi.
[49:04.770 --> 49:05.570]  Edgar Renteria.
[49:06.210 --> 49:09.050]  God, these cards are a little rough to get apart.
[49:09.490 --> 49:10.550]  Sandy Alomar Jr.
[49:10.850 --> 49:12.510]  Is he cousins with Roberto Alomar?
[49:12.510 --> 49:12.850]  Is that right?
[49:12.930 --> 49:13.390]  I think so.
[49:13.590 --> 49:14.430]  Pete Harnish.
[49:16.330 --> 49:17.090]  Brian Giles.
[49:17.830 --> 49:18.450]  Brian Giles.
[49:18.830 --> 49:19.610]  Yeah, Brian Giles.
[49:19.950 --> 49:20.950]  Charles Johnson.
[49:21.630 --> 49:23.490]  Safety first, even when you're taking the photo.
[49:24.330 --> 49:25.330]  I'm definitely taking a picture of that.
[49:27.330 --> 49:28.430]  Oh, Jason Thompson.
[49:28.650 --> 49:29.090]  All right.
[49:29.370 --> 49:30.690]  He's going surfing?
[49:31.030 --> 49:32.210]  I'm in San Diego, so yeah.
[49:32.330 --> 49:32.930]  Yeah, he's going surfing.
[49:32.950 --> 49:33.510]  He's got a surfboard.
[49:33.630 --> 49:33.790]  Yep.
[49:34.150 --> 49:34.770]  Cute card.
[49:35.790 --> 49:37.430]  Oh, everybody's heard of Barry Bonds.
[49:37.590 --> 49:38.270]  We've heard of him.
[49:40.050 --> 49:41.510]  We gotta give this away.
[49:41.510 --> 49:41.850]  Okay.
[49:41.850 --> 49:42.970]  We gotta give this away.
[49:42.970 --> 49:43.370]  What do we got?
[49:44.310 --> 49:44.730]  Oh!
[49:46.310 --> 49:48.210]  Fucking Pedro Martinez, right there.
[49:48.350 --> 49:49.190]  Yeah, yeah, yeah!
[49:49.410 --> 49:50.150]  Yeah, yeah!
[49:50.670 --> 49:51.090]  Ah!
[49:52.070 --> 49:55.750]  Let's go ahead and sleeve that right there for you fuck-facers.
[49:55.970 --> 49:57.550]  Pedro, and then on the back.
[49:57.890 --> 49:58.150]  Or...
[49:58.150 --> 49:58.830]  On the jersey.
[49:58.990 --> 50:01.790]  Or, if you want to protect the front of the card, sleeve it this way.
[50:01.890 --> 50:02.230]  There you go.
[50:03.450 --> 50:04.110]  There you go.
[50:04.530 --> 50:05.090]  All right.
[50:05.710 --> 50:07.910]  One more pack of these, and then...
[50:08.810 --> 50:11.870]  I should probably take stock and figure out what I want to open next.
[50:11.950 --> 50:12.850]  Yeah, because we're running out of time.
[50:12.850 --> 50:13.610]  We're low on time, baby.
[50:13.750 --> 50:14.670]  Running down to the wire.
[50:16.850 --> 50:18.410]  Let's see our big show card.
[50:18.510 --> 50:18.690]  Yep.
[50:19.870 --> 50:20.850]  Oh, Gary Sheffield.
[50:20.990 --> 50:21.230]  Okay.
[50:21.490 --> 50:22.650]  Loved Gary Sheffield when I was a kid.
[50:22.730 --> 50:25.570]  That, uh, him with the Marlins, then, in 97?
[50:25.950 --> 50:26.190]  Yeah.
[50:26.270 --> 50:27.110]  Yeah, yeah.
[50:27.290 --> 50:27.610]  Heartbreaker.
[50:27.610 --> 50:29.070]  Shane Andrews.
[50:29.430 --> 50:30.310]  Michael Tucker.
[50:31.990 --> 50:32.790]  Devin White.
[50:33.890 --> 50:34.690]  Dennis Martinez.
[50:36.590 --> 50:37.390]  Rondell White.
[50:38.490 --> 50:39.770]  Luis Castillo, rookie.
[50:40.410 --> 50:41.690]  Oh, Big Mac.
[50:42.270 --> 50:42.750]  That's a...
[50:42.750 --> 50:43.170]  Nice.
[50:43.390 --> 50:44.490]  Little Pash Brothers situation.
[50:44.650 --> 50:46.530]  A lot of steroids in that beefy little body.
[50:47.490 --> 50:48.870]  That was right when he was doing it, too.
[50:48.950 --> 50:49.230]  Oh, yeah.
[50:49.230 --> 50:50.210]  That was right on the come-up, baby.
[50:50.290 --> 50:50.570]  Yeah.
[50:51.270 --> 50:52.150]  Oh, fuck, dude.
[50:52.250 --> 50:52.630]  Will Clark.
[50:52.790 --> 50:53.490]  Everybody loves Will Clark.
[50:54.930 --> 50:56.250]  Speaking of Will Clark, Matt Williams.
[50:56.990 --> 50:57.350]  Teammate.
[50:59.710 --> 51:00.070]  And...
[51:01.670 --> 51:02.390]  Mike Lansing.
[51:03.170 --> 51:04.610]  And then Dan Wilson.
[51:05.370 --> 51:06.250]  We got ten hats.
[51:06.570 --> 51:07.550]  We got ten hats.
[51:07.610 --> 51:08.650]  There's less, there's less.
[51:08.750 --> 51:09.890]  Almost, we're almost single digits.
[51:10.150 --> 51:10.510]  That's right.
[51:10.610 --> 51:13.650]  That's cool, though, because that means, like, people have, like, a full hour of entertainment
[51:13.650 --> 51:14.970]  and they still have stuff to buy.
[51:15.470 --> 51:16.490]  Full hour of hats.
[51:16.990 --> 51:17.810]  Are you gonna reprint these?
[51:17.890 --> 51:18.430]  Please don't ask me.
[51:18.610 --> 51:19.130]  I do not know.
[51:19.170 --> 51:19.750]  I have no clue.
[51:19.930 --> 51:20.570]  I have no idea.
[51:21.110 --> 51:23.190]  I'm generally in favor of reprinting stuff these days, though.
[51:23.190 --> 51:25.370]  Do you want to, uh...
[51:25.370 --> 51:26.470]  Do you want to open up some country classics?
[51:27.030 --> 51:27.390]  Yeah!
[51:27.930 --> 51:29.130]  Take me to the Chattahoochee.
[51:34.550 --> 51:35.550]  Ask me where I bought these.
[51:36.210 --> 51:37.330]  Hey, Geoff, where'd you get these cards?
[51:37.550 --> 51:37.990]  I have no idea.
[51:38.270 --> 51:39.310]  I have no idea.
[51:39.390 --> 51:40.110]  Not the answer I was expecting.
[51:40.130 --> 51:40.550]  No clue.
[51:40.630 --> 51:41.290]  I have no memory.
[51:41.790 --> 51:43.770]  We're looking for, uh...
[51:45.670 --> 51:46.390]  The gold.
[51:46.790 --> 51:47.770]  Let's search for the gold.
[51:47.930 --> 51:48.610]  Search for the gold.
[51:48.810 --> 51:50.150]  We're gonna open two packs of these.
[51:50.190 --> 51:50.610]  Let's do it.
[51:50.710 --> 51:51.230]  Just two.
[51:51.690 --> 51:52.330]  Just two.
[52:00.390 --> 52:00.970]  What you got?
[52:00.970 --> 52:02.290]  I'll tell you what I got.
[52:02.350 --> 52:03.130]  I have, uh...
[52:03.130 --> 52:03.930]  Sweethearts on the Rodeo.
[52:04.630 --> 52:04.990]  Beautiful.
[52:05.290 --> 52:05.850]  I have...
[52:05.850 --> 52:06.250]  Oh!
[52:06.490 --> 52:07.290]  Wait, hang on.
[52:07.690 --> 52:09.090]  Is this just...
[52:09.090 --> 52:10.150]  It's women fishing?
[52:10.470 --> 52:11.110]  I believe so.
[52:11.290 --> 52:11.850]  At the rodeo.
[52:14.330 --> 52:15.190]  Oh, it's a band.
[52:15.450 --> 52:16.250]  It's, like, really a band.
[52:16.350 --> 52:16.790]  A band called...
[52:16.790 --> 52:18.770]  I thought it was just gonna be, like, uh...
[52:18.770 --> 52:20.230]  Like, oh, here's some women fishing.
[52:20.890 --> 52:22.090]  I didn't think it was gonna be a band.
[52:23.230 --> 52:23.950]  I really...
[52:23.950 --> 52:25.110]  They wrote songs about fish.
[52:25.610 --> 52:26.330]  Buck Owens.
[52:26.390 --> 52:26.590]  Hey!
[52:27.250 --> 52:27.970]  Shelby Lynn.
[52:28.070 --> 52:28.310]  Cool.
[52:28.390 --> 52:28.750]  Cool haircut.
[52:30.350 --> 52:30.690]  Uh...
[52:30.690 --> 52:31.970]  The Legarde twins.
[52:34.110 --> 52:34.790]  Kathy Matea.
[52:34.950 --> 52:35.150]  Uh-huh.
[52:35.750 --> 52:36.610]  Oh, Marie Osmond.
[52:37.650 --> 52:38.910]  My favorite country artist.
[52:39.230 --> 52:39.890]  Marie Osmond, yeah.
[52:41.630 --> 52:42.310]  Ronnie Acoff.
[52:43.490 --> 52:44.610]  Hank Williams Jr.
[52:44.790 --> 52:45.110]  Oh!
[52:46.450 --> 52:47.150]  A lot of anger.
[52:47.150 --> 52:49.370]  It's cool, because you listen to Hank Williams, and he's great.
[52:49.470 --> 52:51.310]  And then you listen to Hank III, and you go, this is great.
[52:51.430 --> 52:54.330]  And you listen to Hank Williams Jr., and you go, and you are also here.
[52:54.410 --> 52:55.310]  Sometimes it skips a generation.
[52:56.510 --> 52:57.190]  Donna Fargo.
[52:57.390 --> 52:58.630]  And then Gene Autry.
[52:58.750 --> 52:59.450]  They are, right?
[53:01.170 --> 53:04.830]  Not the most exciting cards we've ever opened.
[53:06.010 --> 53:07.170]  Oh, Gene Autry in color.
[53:07.330 --> 53:07.830]  Oh, cool.
[53:08.110 --> 53:09.170]  Gene Autry in black and white again.
[53:09.210 --> 53:09.810]  Oh, my God.
[53:11.210 --> 53:12.090]  Chris Ledoux.
[53:14.150 --> 53:15.030]  Dan Seals.
[53:15.130 --> 53:15.350]  Cool.
[53:15.670 --> 53:16.990]  The Strangers.
[53:17.530 --> 53:17.810]  Whoa.
[53:17.910 --> 53:19.570]  The Nitty Gritty Dirt Man.
[53:19.650 --> 53:20.470]  That's a great name.
[53:20.570 --> 53:21.330]  That is a great name.
[53:22.070 --> 53:22.950]  Moe Bandy.
[53:23.110 --> 53:23.930]  That's a good name, too.
[53:24.850 --> 53:25.730]  Patty Page.
[53:26.290 --> 53:27.650]  Here's Jerry Geoff Walker.
[53:27.650 --> 53:28.810]  My dad was a big fan of that guy.
[53:29.610 --> 53:31.090]  And Joe Diffie.
[53:31.350 --> 53:31.650]  Nice.
[53:32.650 --> 53:34.190]  Maybe you should have taken a Diffie photo.
[53:34.710 --> 53:35.550]  Pretty washed out.
[53:35.630 --> 53:37.290]  Well, Geoff, you've got about five minutes left.
[53:37.490 --> 53:40.530]  So, now is the time to figure out what are you swinging for?
[53:40.750 --> 53:41.350]  What are we doing?
[53:41.490 --> 53:42.670]  Are we really getting into this?
[53:42.830 --> 53:43.570]  I want to open it.
[53:43.670 --> 53:44.130]  Let's do it.
[53:44.150 --> 53:44.330]  I'm sick of waiting.
[53:44.530 --> 53:46.170]  I bought this fucking five months ago.
[53:46.190 --> 53:47.730]  I mean, it's Gavin's fault that you waited this long.
[53:47.730 --> 53:48.130]  I know.
[53:48.210 --> 53:48.810]  It is Gavin's fault.
[53:48.870 --> 53:49.570]  We're going to crack open.
[53:49.690 --> 53:50.970]  We're going to end this on some jackass cards.
[53:50.970 --> 53:52.210]  Jackass cards.
[53:52.690 --> 53:55.070]  I'm looking for a Dave England parallel.
[53:55.670 --> 54:01.550]  I'm looking for early, like, Brandon DiCamillo rookie.
[54:01.850 --> 54:02.630]  Oh, yeah.
[54:02.670 --> 54:03.450]  Like, real early stuff.
[54:03.550 --> 54:06.590]  I want, like, I want Rab himself poop meme.
[54:06.670 --> 54:07.230]  That's hell, yeah.
[54:07.370 --> 54:08.170]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[54:08.350 --> 54:08.910]  That's good.
[54:09.710 --> 54:10.250]  What's that?
[54:10.590 --> 54:11.690]  Ah, this is the box.
[54:11.850 --> 54:12.270]  This is a cool box.
[54:12.270 --> 54:13.390]  God damn, that's a pretty cool box, huh?
[54:13.530 --> 54:13.790]  Mm-hmm.
[54:13.830 --> 54:14.070]  Ooh.
[54:16.510 --> 54:19.750]  I want Brad Pitt, when he gets kidnapped.
[54:19.750 --> 54:20.310]  Oh, when he gets kidnapped?
[54:20.530 --> 54:21.030]  Yeah, there you go.
[54:21.070 --> 54:22.230]  Season three of Jackass.
[54:22.250 --> 54:22.770]  Yeah, that is so good.
[54:23.210 --> 54:23.710]  That is so good.
[54:24.870 --> 54:26.290]  Look, you're a pretty good actor.
[54:26.870 --> 54:28.690]  This is so fucking funny.
[54:29.650 --> 54:30.310]  Oh, my God.
[54:30.370 --> 54:32.850]  Have you been watching the history of the world?
[54:33.090 --> 54:33.270]  No.
[54:33.450 --> 54:33.850]  Isn't he good?
[54:34.170 --> 54:34.810]  Yeah, it's good.
[54:35.030 --> 54:38.270]  But there's, uh, there's Johnny Knoxville plays Rasputin.
[54:38.450 --> 54:38.470]  Oh, cool.
[54:38.470 --> 54:42.690]  And they do, like, they call it, like, Jack Rass.
[54:42.810 --> 54:43.030]  Uh-huh.
[54:43.110 --> 54:44.770]  And they have, like, Wee Man and Preston Lacey.
[54:44.830 --> 54:45.470]  Oh, that's cool.
[54:45.590 --> 54:45.730]  It's really funny.
[54:45.790 --> 54:46.030]  That's fun.
[54:46.190 --> 54:47.210]  How many packs we got in there?
[54:47.690 --> 54:48.250]  A lot.
[54:48.290 --> 54:49.670]  Oh, wow, there's a lot in there.
[54:50.290 --> 54:51.350]  All right, we'll get to some.
[54:51.510 --> 54:51.910]  We'll get to some.
[54:51.910 --> 54:52.650]  We should definitely keep that box.
[54:52.710 --> 54:53.210]  That's a cool box.
[54:53.410 --> 54:53.690]  Beautiful box.
[54:54.110 --> 54:54.870]  All right, let's see what we get.
[54:55.170 --> 54:55.230]  Oh, no.
[54:55.430 --> 54:58.510]  Now, there was a bounty for the one-of-one Johnny Knoxville for, like, 10 grand.
[54:58.750 --> 54:59.310]  Wow, really?
[54:59.450 --> 54:59.630]  Yeah.
[54:59.770 --> 55:01.070]  Wow, so we might make 10 grand here.
[55:01.370 --> 55:02.190]  Good, make $10,000.
[55:02.190 --> 55:03.630]  Maybe we can go to the Bean Festival if that happens.
[55:03.630 --> 55:05.150]  Maybe we can go to the Bean Festival.
[55:05.470 --> 55:06.450]  I mean, we've already been told no.
[55:07.590 --> 55:08.430]  We'll show them.
[55:09.030 --> 55:09.810]  We'll show you.
[55:10.990 --> 55:11.710]  Ah, everybody...
[55:11.710 --> 55:12.670]  These are gonna be fun.
[55:12.750 --> 55:12.950]  Okay.
[55:13.130 --> 55:13.670]  The high five.
[55:13.790 --> 55:14.150]  Yay!
[55:14.550 --> 55:15.890]  He fell for the soup!
[55:16.230 --> 55:17.210]  It's so good.
[55:17.790 --> 55:19.230]  There's a great one we should give away.
[55:19.370 --> 55:19.550]  Okay.
[55:19.850 --> 55:20.650]  Behind the lens.
[55:21.170 --> 55:21.490]  Oh!
[55:22.750 --> 55:23.610]  That's a good one.
[55:24.830 --> 55:25.390]  We should...
[55:25.390 --> 55:25.870]  You should pull that.
[55:25.990 --> 55:26.430]  That's a funny one.
[55:26.490 --> 55:26.830]  Yeah, I'll pull that one.
[55:27.850 --> 55:28.930]  P.K. Soobin.
[55:29.170 --> 55:29.530]  Oh, okay.
[55:30.210 --> 55:30.790]  Oh, there's a good one.
[55:30.850 --> 55:31.590]  Hi, I'm Dave England.
[55:31.790 --> 55:31.990]  Yeah.
[55:33.450 --> 55:34.610]  Oh, here's Zach Ass.
[55:35.090 --> 55:35.690]  Oh, hell yeah.
[55:36.110 --> 55:39.930]  I love when Dave England would get so drunk, and then he would be hungover the next day,
[55:39.950 --> 55:40.870]  and they would just fucking...
[55:40.870 --> 55:43.750]  They would just be like, you're doing the crazy stunt, idiot.
[55:44.230 --> 55:44.830]  It's so good.
[55:47.970 --> 55:50.470]  I always remember, like, they were...
[55:50.470 --> 55:52.370]  Jackass 3, they were like, why do you keep making these?
[55:52.650 --> 55:56.410]  And I was like, well, let's just say not all of us are as good with our money as the other ones.
[55:56.450 --> 55:58.070]  And I always assumed he was talking about Dave England.
[55:58.250 --> 55:58.370]  Yeah.
[55:58.750 --> 55:59.330]  And Aaron McGarrity.
[55:59.670 --> 56:00.910]  It's definitely danger, Aaron.
[56:01.450 --> 56:02.430]  The field goal.
[56:02.870 --> 56:03.470]  Oh, that's a good one.
[56:03.730 --> 56:07.470]  Oh, here's behind the lens, making... looks like a Lance throw-up.
[56:07.590 --> 56:07.910]  Oh, yeah.
[56:09.210 --> 56:10.570]  Some people never learn.
[56:10.690 --> 56:11.510]  Jackass Forever.
[56:13.430 --> 56:14.750]  Here's Jasper, rookie card.
[56:14.830 --> 56:15.390]  Oh, nice.
[56:16.090 --> 56:17.330]  And then the marquee explosion.
[56:17.510 --> 56:18.010]  That was pretty funny.
[56:18.890 --> 56:19.870]  These cards are pretty good.
[56:19.950 --> 56:20.470]  Yeah, these are pretty good.
[56:20.550 --> 56:21.210]  Who put these out?
[56:21.770 --> 56:22.290]  Do you know?
[56:22.470 --> 56:22.710]  I don't remember.
[56:23.150 --> 56:23.770]  These are great.
[56:23.910 --> 56:24.570]  I can find out, though.
[56:24.810 --> 56:25.510]  It's probably on the card.
[56:25.630 --> 56:30.370]  We got about three minutes left, so we're gonna go through a few of these and call it.
[56:30.950 --> 56:33.130]  I wonder if the hats... the hats have to be almost gone.
[56:33.190 --> 56:33.810]  That's crazy.
[56:34.050 --> 56:35.190]  There's one hat?!
[56:35.190 --> 56:35.790]  There's one hat.
[56:35.850 --> 56:36.850]  You can buy the last hat.
[56:36.870 --> 56:37.330]  Oh, my God.
[56:37.410 --> 56:38.430]  The Invisible Man.
[56:38.510 --> 56:38.890]  That's pretty funny.
[56:38.890 --> 56:39.630]  Oh, that's a good one.
[56:40.210 --> 56:42.250]  Isn't that where the bull takes him out and he just gets fucked?
[56:42.310 --> 56:42.810]  I think so.
[56:44.270 --> 56:45.150]  Oh, here's another one.
[56:45.310 --> 56:45.830]  This is pretty funny.
[56:45.830 --> 56:48.150]  Speaking of bathing...
[56:48.150 --> 56:48.550]  Nice.
[56:50.610 --> 56:51.330]  Exploding toilet.
[56:52.870 --> 56:53.230]  Picture...
[56:53.230 --> 56:55.290]  And then Scorpion Lip Injection.
[56:55.350 --> 56:56.250]  Oh, that...
[56:56.250 --> 56:58.410]  Dude, she was fucking awesome in that one.
[56:58.530 --> 56:58.650]  She just took it.
[56:58.650 --> 56:59.330]  She was awesome.
[56:59.510 --> 57:00.210]  So good.
[57:00.270 --> 57:01.110]  I can't.
[57:01.710 --> 57:02.690]  It was so brutal.
[57:02.710 --> 57:05.010]  And to me, it's not even that you're getting stung on the lip.
[57:05.090 --> 57:06.910]  It's that that thing has to be so close to you.
[57:06.990 --> 57:07.910]  That makes me go like...
[57:07.910 --> 57:09.210]  Yeah, I don't want to be that close to that thing.
[57:09.350 --> 57:09.570]  Nuh-uh.
[57:09.870 --> 57:11.110]  Yeah, the Exploding Room.
[57:11.230 --> 57:11.490]  Nice.
[57:11.930 --> 57:12.630]  Oh, here we go.
[57:12.710 --> 57:13.830]  Hi, I'm Rob Dyrdek.
[57:15.830 --> 57:16.290]  There you go.
[57:16.330 --> 57:18.050]  Hi, I'm Lance Bangs.
[57:18.070 --> 57:19.150]  Lance Bangs is awesome.
[57:19.170 --> 57:20.430]  Oh, this is nice.
[57:20.570 --> 57:20.650]  Okay.
[57:21.450 --> 57:22.170]  Jackass Forever.
[57:24.610 --> 57:26.730]  Red Parallel 14 of 25.
[57:27.670 --> 57:28.290]  Very cool.
[57:28.450 --> 57:29.390]  That's a cool card.
[57:29.610 --> 57:30.030]  Not bad at all.
[57:30.370 --> 57:31.130]  Gotta hang on to that one.
[57:31.470 --> 57:32.370]  And then the Milkshake.
[57:32.650 --> 57:32.930]  Okay.
[57:33.190 --> 57:33.630]  And what do you say?
[57:33.670 --> 57:34.170]  Last one here?
[57:34.390 --> 57:35.110]  This is the last one.
[57:35.170 --> 57:35.730]  This is it.
[57:35.790 --> 57:36.170]  This is it.
[57:36.190 --> 57:38.810]  This is where we're getting 10 grand and we're going to the Bean Festival.
[57:39.190 --> 57:40.690]  Well, then what happens...
[57:40.690 --> 57:42.110]  The audience doesn't see...
[57:42.110 --> 57:42.830]  As soon as we...
[57:42.830 --> 57:43.110]  Uh-huh.
[57:43.270 --> 57:44.430]  As soon as we end.
[57:44.430 --> 57:44.790]  Uh-huh.
[57:44.910 --> 57:45.770]  And they go about their day.
[57:45.870 --> 57:47.370]  I have to put all this shit back in my car.
[57:47.470 --> 57:47.670]  Yes.
[57:47.790 --> 57:48.690]  It takes me like an hour.
[57:48.770 --> 57:49.310]  Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[57:49.570 --> 57:50.310]  The Jet Ski.
[57:50.590 --> 57:51.030]  Good one.
[57:52.110 --> 57:52.650]  Here we go.
[57:52.670 --> 57:53.430]  Behind the Lens.
[57:53.710 --> 57:53.810]  Uh-huh.
[57:54.550 --> 57:57.350]  Here is a Silver Prism Cup Test.
[57:57.750 --> 57:58.610]  That's pretty funny.
[57:59.210 --> 58:00.130]  Another Silver Prism.
[58:00.150 --> 58:01.250]  This one's numbered to 100.
[58:01.770 --> 58:02.830]  I don't even remember this.
[58:02.910 --> 58:03.730]  European Vacation.
[58:03.810 --> 58:04.570]  That must have been cut.
[58:05.850 --> 58:07.790]  And I think we can show this.
[58:09.490 --> 58:10.450]  Good way to end it.
[58:11.390 --> 58:11.850]  There you go.
[58:12.010 --> 58:12.930]  Oh, my God.
[58:14.430 --> 58:15.870]  It's probably better that we didn't show it.
[58:17.370 --> 58:19.250]  It's probably better that we didn't show it.
[58:19.510 --> 58:20.190]  Yeah, it's...
[58:20.190 --> 58:21.590]  The hats sold out?
[58:21.670 --> 58:22.170]  We did it?
[58:22.250 --> 58:23.050]  Hats sold out.
[58:23.150 --> 58:23.410]  Man.
[58:24.050 --> 58:24.810]  We did it.
[58:24.850 --> 58:25.030]  What?
[58:26.090 --> 58:27.090]  70 hats left.
[58:27.510 --> 58:28.930]  We are almost out of bats.
[58:29.650 --> 58:31.030]  How many bats did I say?
[58:31.050 --> 58:31.810]  3 million bats?
[58:31.810 --> 58:32.650]  Yeah, something like that.
[58:32.730 --> 58:33.950]  We only have like a few left.
[58:34.030 --> 58:34.530]  Jesus Christ.
[58:34.650 --> 58:37.330]  Well, guys, thanks for joining us for a break show.
[58:37.450 --> 58:39.070]  Hopefully we can get some more of these going pretty soon.
[58:39.830 --> 58:41.410]  Go to store.roosterteeth.com.
[58:41.470 --> 58:42.170]  Pick up a green bat.
[58:42.570 --> 58:43.750]  Pick up a monthly baseball shirt.
[58:43.750 --> 58:45.790]  The monkey's afraid of the baseball.
[58:45.970 --> 58:47.550]  He's going to hit in the face, Justin Turner style.
[58:48.150 --> 58:49.130]  That's just what happens.
[58:49.410 --> 58:50.890]  But thank you for joining us, Geoff.
[58:51.630 --> 58:52.590]  So many cards.
[58:52.910 --> 58:56.430]  And so many that we're going to pull and give away to people who bought stuff.
[58:56.490 --> 58:57.450]  We're going to take 10 of these.
[58:57.470 --> 58:57.690]  Yep.
[58:57.990 --> 58:58.370]  10 good ones.
[58:58.370 --> 58:58.950]  And we're going to give them.
[58:59.030 --> 59:00.070]  10 really good ones.
[59:01.330 --> 59:02.510]  Clearly going to be that card.
[59:02.550 --> 59:02.810]  Boom.
[59:02.910 --> 59:03.930]  And it's going to go right in.
[59:04.010 --> 59:04.530]  Pedro Martinez.
[59:05.010 --> 59:05.330]  The...
[59:05.870 --> 59:06.330]  Hang on.
[59:07.130 --> 59:09.470]  Face card sleeve that we have not put on sale yet.
[59:09.530 --> 59:10.770]  I think we might sell...
[59:10.770 --> 59:12.130]  Are we going to do the card sleeve?
[59:12.750 --> 59:13.470]  I think...
[59:13.470 --> 59:14.930]  Should we do the card sleeve?
[59:14.930 --> 59:15.510]  Should we sell them?
[59:15.570 --> 59:17.310]  Should we do the card sleeve?
[59:18.390 --> 59:19.390]  I don't know.
[59:19.450 --> 59:20.410]  I mean, we haven't.
[59:20.690 --> 59:23.050]  And it's just a thing where it's like, is this a thing we're going to do?
[59:24.070 --> 59:25.850]  So, card sleeves maybe.
[59:26.430 --> 59:26.970]  Oh, man.
[59:27.190 --> 59:31.690]  We didn't even tell them about the piece of merch that we have that's so disturbing we decided not to show it.
[59:32.230 --> 59:33.030]  What was that?
[59:33.450 --> 59:34.170]  Tony brought it in.
[59:35.430 --> 59:36.250]  I don't remember.
[59:36.470 --> 59:36.870]  Oh.
[59:37.190 --> 59:37.490]  Oh.
[59:38.490 --> 59:38.890]  Yep.
[59:38.890 --> 59:38.990]  Yep.
[59:39.170 --> 59:42.490]  We have more coming soon that is...
[59:44.210 --> 59:44.690]  Fucked.
[59:44.830 --> 59:45.170]  Yeah.
[59:47.370 --> 59:49.230]  Well, thanks for joining us.
[59:49.750 --> 59:50.890]  This has been...
[59:53.690 --> 59:54.950]  Face Break Show.
[59:55.330 --> 59:56.670]  This has been fun.
[59:56.750 --> 59:57.350]  We've opened cards.
[59:57.430 --> 59:58.030]  We've sold some stuff.
[59:58.130 --> 59:58.450]  I'm Eric.
[59:58.510 --> 59:59.050]  He's Geoff.
[59:59.410 --> 01:00:01.350]  Any parting words for everyone watching this?
[01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:02.870]  Just thanks for tuning in.
[01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:06.850]  And if you like these kind of shows, let us know.
[01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:09.550]  And hopefully we will continue to do more break shows.
[01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.770]  Yeah.
[01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:11.150]  I'd like to do it mostly weekly.
[01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:11.490]  Yep.
[01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:12.930]  As we say here at Rooster Teeth.
[01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:16.210]  Follow us at FuckFacePod on Instagram and on Twitter.
[01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:16.950]  We'll see you guys later.
[01:00:17.170 --> 01:00:22.830]  Yeah, and if you bought anything in the last hour, you have a really good shot at getting a gold JCPenney.
[01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:28.290]  What is cheating?
