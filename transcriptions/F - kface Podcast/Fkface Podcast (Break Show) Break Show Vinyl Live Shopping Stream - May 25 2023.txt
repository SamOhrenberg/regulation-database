[00:00.250 --> 00:03.210]  I imagine I'm kind of like a spider.
[00:03.490 --> 00:04.990]  A big spider.
[00:06.490 --> 00:11.130]  Hello and welcome to whatever this show is called. The Break Show with Geoff and Eric.
[00:11.250 --> 00:12.490]  Hi. I'm Geoff, he's Eric.
[00:12.570 --> 00:12.750]  Hello.
[00:12.850 --> 00:13.870]  This is Don Zimmer.
[00:14.290 --> 00:14.850]  Pussy slay.
[00:15.010 --> 00:18.950]  That's Don Zimmer. That's Don Zimmer. There's a lot of Don Zimmer around.
[00:19.110 --> 00:19.230]  Yeah.
[00:19.410 --> 00:22.430]  But we're not just doing this for our health. We're here today to promote...
[00:22.430 --> 00:23.070]  Don't forget you're tethered.
[00:23.690 --> 00:24.670]  The... I'm tethered.
[00:25.850 --> 00:27.650]  The... Rip it off the fucking wall.
[00:27.770 --> 00:28.010]  Uh-huh.
[00:28.430 --> 00:29.390]  Eric, look at this. It's here.
[00:29.390 --> 00:29.470]  Yeah.
[00:29.610 --> 00:31.010]  It's finally here. I mean, you've had it for months.
[00:31.210 --> 00:32.130]  I've had it for a long time.
[00:32.230 --> 00:33.150]  This is the first time I've seen it.
[00:33.450 --> 00:36.730]  This is the official fuck face.
[00:38.050 --> 00:38.770]  First vinyl.
[00:38.950 --> 00:39.110]  Yep.
[00:39.230 --> 00:40.650]  Our very first vinyl pressing.
[00:40.890 --> 00:41.310]  Episode 16.
[00:41.450 --> 00:42.110]  Episode 16.
[00:42.290 --> 00:46.190]  So this will be on sale at 11.10 AM, which is around five minutes from now.
[00:46.470 --> 00:47.210]  Six minutes from now.
[00:48.630 --> 00:50.550]  Here's the back. It has all of our names.
[00:51.010 --> 00:56.210]  It features Geoff Ramsey, Gavin Free, Andrew Panton, Eric Baudour, Nick Schwartz, Agneg.
[00:56.210 --> 01:01.190]  T-Bone, Ram Scoop, Ice Man.
[01:01.190 --> 01:03.590]  It's Ram Scoop. I've been calling him Ramrod in my head.
[01:03.890 --> 01:05.190]  It's Ram Scoop. Thank you.
[01:06.850 --> 01:07.250]  Frosty.
[01:07.570 --> 01:07.970]  Frosty.
[01:08.950 --> 01:09.670]  Gooch Pooch.
[01:09.750 --> 01:10.930]  That has not come out yet.
[01:11.870 --> 01:13.330]  That one's not out yet.
[01:14.950 --> 01:19.330]  This episode, you guys, if you're watching this, you're getting a sneak peek into my personal hell.
[01:19.470 --> 01:20.930]  And Nick Schwartz, the regulation guy.
[01:20.990 --> 01:25.850]  Yeah, what was... We gave him... There's a nickname for it, and I really don't remember what it is, but it's the title of the episode.
[01:25.850 --> 01:26.890]  That comes out next week.
[01:27.230 --> 01:30.110]  It's Gooch Pooch and something, and it's just like, oh, this sucks.
[01:30.250 --> 01:31.390]  Let's crack it open.
[01:31.510 --> 01:34.850]  Yeah, this is... So this will go on sale at 11.10 a.m.
[01:35.030 --> 01:37.790]  Because we want you to be on store.roosterteeth.com.
[01:38.070 --> 01:41.270]  And then you can refresh or whatever.
[01:41.470 --> 01:43.330]  There's like a little QR code that can pop up.
[01:43.670 --> 01:46.790]  You can scan the QR code, but you're already watching this on your phone, so how do you do that?
[01:46.990 --> 01:48.030]  Get your girlfriend's phone.
[01:48.510 --> 01:51.930]  Scan it from her phone, and then use her Apple Pay.
[01:53.870 --> 01:54.270]  So...
[01:54.270 --> 01:56.110]  Use Eric's wife's Apple Pay.
[01:56.190 --> 01:58.050]  No! That's my Apple Pay.
[01:58.330 --> 02:01.230]  This is it in all its beautiful glory.
[02:01.430 --> 02:02.030]  Wow, look at it.
[02:02.070 --> 02:04.370]  Black vinyl. Regulation vinyl.
[02:04.550 --> 02:05.890]  Side A, side B.
[02:06.290 --> 02:09.850]  This is really... We really put an episode of a podcast on a vinyl record.
[02:10.190 --> 02:12.790]  Not only an episode of a podcast, but episode 16.
[02:13.190 --> 02:16.230]  Actually, not only episode 16, but the first episode 16.
[02:16.630 --> 02:17.250]  Episode 16-1.
[02:17.490 --> 02:19.950]  16-1, because I believe there were many episodes.
[02:20.150 --> 02:21.070]  That was...
[02:21.070 --> 02:22.750]  It was our 16 era.
[02:22.750 --> 02:28.670]  So, definitely grab that, because I don't know that we're ever going to make it again.
[02:29.310 --> 02:31.230]  And if you say, can you bring this back?
[02:31.430 --> 02:32.730]  My answer will likely be no.
[02:33.350 --> 02:36.030]  Because I can't imagine that we're making any money on this.
[02:36.550 --> 02:38.130]  No, I don't think we are, but that's okay.
[02:38.470 --> 02:40.150]  It's more about...
[02:40.150 --> 02:44.570]  I mean, it's okay from the Geoff way of looking at things where we get to do the fun thing.
[02:44.850 --> 02:47.870]  It's not okay in the producer way of looking at things where they go,
[02:47.870 --> 02:50.690]  Hey, I need you to sit in this meeting and we need to look at these numbers.
[02:50.710 --> 02:54.250]  And I go, no. Stop. Stop.
[02:55.010 --> 02:57.110]  Why did you sell this? I don't know!
[02:57.790 --> 02:59.110]  We're not going to lose money on it.
[02:59.690 --> 03:01.170]  We just might not make any money on it.
[03:01.190 --> 03:04.890]  But the important thing is that the vinyl, the magic that's in that vinyl...
[03:05.430 --> 03:07.670]  Have you ever seen Boogie Nights when they're trying to get the tapes?
[03:08.110 --> 03:10.610]  And he's like, the magic that's on these tapes belongs to me.
[03:10.670 --> 03:14.610]  So that's what needs to happen is that you need to buy the vinyl.
[03:14.610 --> 03:17.770]  But in order to get the vinyl, you need to give us the money.
[03:17.850 --> 03:19.730]  And then we get the money and then we give you the vinyl.
[03:20.090 --> 03:22.230]  But you have to get the vinyl. That's where the magic's at.
[03:22.250 --> 03:22.670]  That's a wipe.
[03:22.690 --> 03:23.290]  The magic's at.
[03:23.330 --> 03:26.070]  P.M.P. I don't understand all of your music jargon.
[03:26.970 --> 03:27.770]  I'm like, is it John Cerelli?
[03:29.710 --> 03:31.150]  Whoa! Whoa!
[03:31.470 --> 03:33.350]  You and I have seen maybe too much Boogie Nights.
[03:33.550 --> 03:36.110]  I saw it in theaters when they did...
[03:37.210 --> 03:38.250]  What's Wes's favorite movie?
[03:39.250 --> 03:39.830]  Liquorice Pizza.
[03:40.130 --> 03:42.910]  They released Boogie Nights again.
[03:42.970 --> 03:43.570]  They showed it in Alamo.
[03:43.570 --> 03:44.590]  And I saw it.
[03:44.710 --> 03:49.610]  And then the last scene with Alfred Merlina and the guys throwing the little snaps.
[03:50.350 --> 03:51.570]  I almost had a panic attack.
[03:51.830 --> 03:54.330]  Because it was so loud and I was fucking...
[03:54.330 --> 03:55.630]  I was like white knuckling it.
[03:55.670 --> 03:56.170]  He's so scary.
[03:56.170 --> 03:57.650]  I was just going like...
[03:57.650 --> 03:58.530]  We've got the robe on.
[03:58.530 --> 03:58.970]  I've seen the movie a hundred times.
[03:59.410 --> 04:00.150]  Jessie's Girl is playing.
[04:01.630 --> 04:02.390]  That was...
[04:02.390 --> 04:03.350]  Jessie's Girl!
[04:03.430 --> 04:03.850]  That's the best.
[04:03.890 --> 04:06.110]  That is the first DVD I ever bought.
[04:06.170 --> 04:06.430]  Really?
[04:06.650 --> 04:06.950]  Yeah.
[04:07.050 --> 04:07.310]  Wow.
[04:07.330 --> 04:08.930]  I bought a DVD player on base.
[04:09.070 --> 04:09.430]  I was in the army.
[04:09.970 --> 04:12.870]  They had it at the PX and they were like 700 bucks out in the wild.
[04:12.870 --> 04:14.070]  They had them for like 300.
[04:14.350 --> 04:17.110]  So I bought one and then I could afford one DVD if I got Boogie Nights.
[04:17.210 --> 04:17.630]  Boogie Nights.
[04:17.710 --> 04:19.230]  I watched it 86 times.
[04:19.350 --> 04:20.750]  The beginning and Boogie Nights.
[04:21.550 --> 04:24.110]  I just love Mark Wahlberg's cock.
[04:24.490 --> 04:25.670]  It's just like...
[04:25.670 --> 04:26.610]  How can you say no?
[04:27.950 --> 04:30.050]  Anyway, we're going to open up a bunch of cards today.
[04:30.110 --> 04:31.690]  But we're like two minutes away or something.
[04:32.730 --> 04:34.850]  While we try to convince you to buy this vinyl.
[04:35.050 --> 04:35.950]  Here's what's going to happen.
[04:36.150 --> 04:37.030]  Here's what I promise you.
[04:37.070 --> 04:39.770]  If this vinyl sells out and it sells out quickly, how many do we make?
[04:40.030 --> 04:40.630]  I don't know.
[04:40.750 --> 04:41.070]  Hundreds.
[04:41.470 --> 04:41.830]  Hundreds.
[04:42.230 --> 04:42.350]  All right.
[04:42.410 --> 04:43.370]  Well, however many we make.
[04:43.830 --> 04:47.050]  Because there was some confusion of like, I thought that it was going to have a different cover.
[04:47.210 --> 04:49.070]  We had joked around about a million different covers.
[04:49.670 --> 04:53.690]  The cover that most people are thinking of is for the next vinyl I want to make.
[04:54.090 --> 04:56.430]  But the next vinyl I want to make requires everybody to be in the same place.
[04:56.750 --> 04:57.130]  Oh, that's right.
[04:57.150 --> 05:01.110]  Because I want to put us all, all of us physically in the porta potty.
[05:01.950 --> 05:03.390]  And then that's going to be called the pink album.
[05:03.810 --> 05:05.090]  And that'll be a vinyl.
[05:05.410 --> 05:08.370]  It'll be an episode of Fuckface that only exists on that vinyl.
[05:08.370 --> 05:10.990]  But we got to sell this little bitch out first.
[05:11.090 --> 05:13.510]  And who knows, maybe we'll make some of the other episodes 16 someday.
[05:13.690 --> 05:14.370]  But probably not.
[05:14.890 --> 05:16.050]  Eric seems to think not.
[05:16.130 --> 05:17.610]  I just, it was a good idea.
[05:17.710 --> 05:18.770]  But anyway, scan the QR code.
[05:18.890 --> 05:19.630]  Use your mom's cell phone.
[05:19.710 --> 05:20.530]  Use your mom's credit card.
[05:20.950 --> 05:25.230]  Buy that vinyl when it goes on sale in two minutes.
[05:25.450 --> 05:27.790]  And if you don't have a mom, that's very sad.
[05:27.890 --> 05:28.430]  I don't have a dad.
[05:29.010 --> 05:30.650]  Use Eric's mom's credit card.
[05:30.710 --> 05:31.590]  Don't use my mom's credit card.
[05:31.910 --> 05:32.130]  Yeah.
[05:32.330 --> 05:32.770]  She's alive.
[05:32.830 --> 05:33.170]  She's around.
[05:34.770 --> 05:36.270]  She's not using it this moment.
[05:36.350 --> 05:37.350]  I don't assume.
[05:37.350 --> 05:37.390]  I don't assume.
[05:37.550 --> 05:37.830]  Okay.
[05:38.430 --> 05:40.330]  Well, we're ready for this to go on sale.
[05:40.410 --> 05:43.970]  Do you want to open a pack in honor of this about to go on sale?
[05:44.190 --> 05:45.610]  What do we open up first?
[05:45.710 --> 05:46.270]  I think I know.
[05:46.350 --> 05:46.950]  I think I know, Eric.
[05:46.970 --> 05:47.870]  I want to open up...
[05:48.350 --> 05:49.410]  I want to open up...
[05:49.410 --> 05:50.250]  Well, first off...
[05:50.250 --> 05:52.050]  Hey, Cody, when it goes on sale, will you yell at me?
[05:52.930 --> 05:53.430]  Thank you.
[05:53.650 --> 05:54.870]  We got to do it the right way.
[05:54.930 --> 05:56.190]  We got to go into the pack sack.
[05:56.270 --> 05:57.110]  The sack pack.
[05:57.230 --> 05:57.670]  Pack sack.
[05:58.610 --> 05:59.770]  It'll be our first offering.
[05:59.870 --> 06:00.090]  Okay.
[06:00.950 --> 06:02.010]  Hopefully we'll get like...
[06:02.010 --> 06:02.330]  Okay.
[06:02.510 --> 06:02.670]  Okay.
[06:03.150 --> 06:03.790]  91 tops.
[06:03.930 --> 06:04.410]  That could be...
[06:04.410 --> 06:05.830]  That could be a Don Zimmer.
[06:05.830 --> 06:06.970]  We might get Zimmed.
[06:08.390 --> 06:08.990]  Here we go.
[06:09.050 --> 06:09.630]  This is exciting.
[06:09.930 --> 06:11.610]  It's been a minute since I've done Zim hunting.
[06:11.750 --> 06:12.270]  It's live!
[06:12.830 --> 06:13.550]  SwordArtOverseas.com.
[06:13.670 --> 06:14.450]  Scan the QR code.
[06:14.670 --> 06:15.530]  Use your dad's credit card.
[06:15.570 --> 06:15.750]  Hurry.
[06:15.970 --> 06:16.690]  Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[06:17.070 --> 06:18.330]  Or your mom's credit card.
[06:18.370 --> 06:18.530]  Yeah.
[06:18.870 --> 06:19.190]  Somebody...
[06:19.190 --> 06:19.950]  Or Eric's mom's credit card.
[06:19.970 --> 06:20.770]  Use a credit card.
[06:21.110 --> 06:22.250]  Or Apple Pay.
[06:22.370 --> 06:23.450]  And they flipped it for me this time.
[06:23.510 --> 06:23.730]  Okay.
[06:25.170 --> 06:25.750]  So it's looking good.
[06:25.810 --> 06:25.930]  Ready?
[06:26.550 --> 06:27.270]  Brian Harvey.
[06:27.450 --> 06:27.970]  Brian Harvey.
[06:28.030 --> 06:28.750]  Holy shit.
[06:28.890 --> 06:30.250]  All the way back from 1991.
[06:32.810 --> 06:33.530]  Gary Reedus.
[06:33.630 --> 06:33.890]  Okay.
[06:33.890 --> 06:35.810]  You know, here's a thought I had while I'm looking at these.
[06:35.890 --> 06:37.190]  Tim Wallach from the Expos.
[06:37.250 --> 06:37.890]  God bless him.
[06:38.010 --> 06:38.430]  Great uniform.
[06:39.050 --> 06:39.770]  Great logo.
[06:40.010 --> 06:40.570]  Great team.
[06:40.770 --> 06:44.590]  I went up to Montreal a few years ago for a wedding and... or a bachelor party.
[06:45.850 --> 06:46.210]  And...
[06:47.270 --> 06:48.670]  I saw a lot of stuff at that bachelor party.
[06:49.650 --> 06:50.390]  What the fuck?
[06:50.450 --> 06:50.890]  It was...
[06:52.750 --> 06:54.250]  But they have a lot of Expos gear still.
[06:54.350 --> 06:54.630]  It's pretty cool.
[06:54.690 --> 06:55.510]  That's nice.
[06:55.770 --> 06:56.370]  Geoff McKnight.
[06:56.370 --> 06:57.370]  I went to a...
[06:58.730 --> 06:59.610]  It was...
[06:59.610 --> 07:01.870]  My cousin, who is...
[07:01.870 --> 07:02.550]  He's gay.
[07:02.650 --> 07:03.430]  So he married another man.
[07:03.550 --> 07:06.850]  And I went to a strip club where the walls were just trash bags.
[07:07.790 --> 07:09.170]  Just like black trash bags.
[07:10.210 --> 07:13.330]  It was the fucking craziest place I've ever been in my entire life.
[07:13.350 --> 07:13.970]  What the fuck?
[07:13.990 --> 07:14.970]  Just wild.
[07:15.290 --> 07:17.090]  They know how to party in Montreal.
[07:17.430 --> 07:19.590]  Start at RoosterTeeth.com to grab the episode 16 vinyl.
[07:19.710 --> 07:21.530]  Do you love the content that you're hearing right now?
[07:21.790 --> 07:23.370]  Is some of it on episode 16?
[07:23.430 --> 07:24.030]  I don't remember.
[07:24.530 --> 07:25.390]  But listen now.
[07:25.390 --> 07:26.070]  Grab the vinyl.
[07:26.270 --> 07:27.870]  If it sells out, I don't know what we'll do.
[07:28.010 --> 07:30.710]  I gotta say, I'm looking at the Geoff McKnight Orioles card.
[07:30.970 --> 07:32.490]  And I'm getting some Eric vibes.
[07:32.710 --> 07:33.610]  Oh, I definitely...
[07:33.610 --> 07:34.270]  Some strong Eric vibes.
[07:34.530 --> 07:36.530]  I'm gonna set this aside as an Eric vibes card.
[07:36.530 --> 07:38.310]  I think it's the glasses and stuff.
[07:38.530 --> 07:40.150]  It's just like the fuck you look.
[07:40.250 --> 07:42.330]  I just wanna say the warm up jersey that they have.
[07:42.630 --> 07:44.270]  The old look to that.
[07:44.650 --> 07:45.450]  I love that.
[07:46.030 --> 07:49.430]  That's the kind of jersey that makes you wanna put a fuck face on a bat and take a photo.
[07:49.730 --> 07:50.530]  Chuck Crimm.
[07:51.310 --> 07:53.850]  Oh, look at this awesome action card.
[07:53.950 --> 07:55.270]  Walt Weiss action card.
[07:55.270 --> 07:56.470]  I don't know if you remember Walt Weiss.
[07:56.650 --> 07:56.830]  I do.
[07:56.850 --> 07:58.010]  Oh, the Vegas Athletics.
[07:58.090 --> 08:00.570]  He was a shortstop for the A's back in the Bash Brothers days.
[08:02.150 --> 08:02.950]  Sergio Valdez.
[08:02.970 --> 08:03.230]  Okay.
[08:04.230 --> 08:06.790]  Ooh, first draft pick for Kurt Miller.
[08:07.050 --> 08:09.250]  Looks like he took that photo in his parents' backyard.
[08:10.650 --> 08:11.850]  About 17, maybe.
[08:13.590 --> 08:14.390]  Joe Bover.
[08:14.550 --> 08:14.850]  Uh-huh.
[08:15.410 --> 08:15.810]  Checklist.
[08:15.830 --> 08:16.770]  Wait, Joe Bover?
[08:17.330 --> 08:17.730]  Boever.
[08:17.990 --> 08:18.910]  Oh, okay.
[08:19.210 --> 08:19.610]  Joannis.
[08:19.770 --> 08:20.170]  I don't know.
[08:20.350 --> 08:20.610]  Bover.
[08:21.710 --> 08:22.510]  Ryan Sandberg.
[08:22.590 --> 08:22.910]  Nice.
[08:22.910 --> 08:23.870]  Shout-out.
[08:23.970 --> 08:24.990]  Love the way he spells Ryan.
[08:25.230 --> 08:25.870]  Edgar Martinez.
[08:26.150 --> 08:26.810]  Shout-out.
[08:27.710 --> 08:28.430]  Luis Quinonez.
[08:29.450 --> 08:30.170]  Matt Williams.
[08:31.370 --> 08:33.510]  I always felt bad for that dude, because he played with Will Clark.
[08:33.670 --> 08:36.490]  And it's like, Matt Williams is real good, but nobody gave a shit because of Will Clark.
[08:36.550 --> 08:36.690]  Nope.
[08:36.690 --> 08:36.910]  Sorry, bud.
[08:37.210 --> 08:39.130]  And then Sil Camposano.
[08:39.270 --> 08:40.630]  So we struck out on Zimmer.
[08:40.630 --> 08:41.390]  Sorry, no Zim.
[08:41.630 --> 08:43.490]  But we did get a pretty sweet Geoff McKnight.
[08:43.570 --> 08:43.770]  Yeah.
[08:44.050 --> 08:44.410]  Rockin'.
[08:44.410 --> 08:45.510]  It's looking good.
[08:45.730 --> 08:46.250]  Eric vibes.
[08:46.370 --> 08:47.690]  Love that Orioles look.
[08:47.770 --> 08:49.310]  If it's not that bird, it's a mean bird.
[08:49.370 --> 08:49.710]  It's cool.
[08:49.830 --> 08:50.750]  Oh, Donruss.
[08:50.870 --> 08:51.130]  Americana.
[08:51.130 --> 08:51.950]  We're gonna do some of this.
[08:52.070 --> 08:52.850]  We've opened this before.
[08:53.030 --> 08:56.270]  This is the 2009 Donruss Americana.
[08:56.570 --> 08:59.890]  And the real chase cards in here are Jackie Chan.
[09:00.030 --> 09:00.430]  Whoa!
[09:00.950 --> 09:02.210]  We can get a Relic, I think.
[09:02.310 --> 09:03.050]  Chan time, baby.
[09:03.170 --> 09:03.770]  Let's do it.
[09:04.770 --> 09:05.790]  That's what I'm going for.
[09:06.330 --> 09:09.190]  Can you yell that there are less than 75 left?
[09:11.010 --> 09:13.270]  Yes, I'm going to walk on and whisper it into his ear.
[09:13.410 --> 09:14.410]  Cody, you can just yell it.
[09:14.530 --> 09:15.330]  That was me!
[09:15.450 --> 09:16.230]  That was me!
[09:16.330 --> 09:17.590]  I was gonna yell it!
[09:17.630 --> 09:18.410]  They're almost gone.
[09:18.490 --> 09:19.170]  38 left.
[09:19.250 --> 09:20.230]  What are you doing?
[09:20.230 --> 09:24.330]  We bought 39, and it sounds like somebody bought one, so we're down to 38.
[09:24.450 --> 09:25.710]  We bought...
[09:25.710 --> 09:28.890]  It went up, and within 10 seconds, we sold 125.
[09:29.230 --> 09:29.990]  This is insane.
[09:30.190 --> 09:31.430]  I don't...
[09:31.430 --> 09:32.570]  We're not...
[09:32.570 --> 09:36.650]  If we could figure out how to make money on vinyl records, we might be in business.
[09:38.510 --> 09:44.690]  All we have to do is crack the code that the music industry has been unable to crack for the last 30 years.
[09:46.150 --> 09:47.510]  Alright, well, they're sold out!
[09:48.070 --> 09:48.390]  So...
[09:48.390 --> 09:50.350]  Dude, here's Teddy Gintry.
[09:50.490 --> 09:51.210]  I'm gonna be honest.
[09:51.370 --> 09:53.610]  I don't know who Teddy Gintry is, but...
[09:55.570 --> 09:57.790]  He looks like, uh...
[10:00.240 --> 10:01.100]  What are we gonna do?
[10:01.100 --> 10:01.920]  He looks like that...
[10:01.920 --> 10:04.460]  Who's the guy that made Best in Show?
[10:04.540 --> 10:04.980]  What's his name?
[10:05.320 --> 10:05.860]  Christopher Guess.
[10:05.960 --> 10:06.600]  He does look like Christopher Guess.
[10:06.600 --> 10:08.420]  He looks exactly like Christopher Guess.
[10:08.860 --> 10:10.000]  He looks like, um...
[10:10.620 --> 10:13.260]  I mean, it's the haircut with, like, the beard goatee thing.
[10:13.540 --> 10:14.340]  What happened?
[10:15.120 --> 10:16.220]  How did these sell out?
[10:16.780 --> 10:17.780]  Because people know value!
[10:18.060 --> 10:18.500]  What?
[10:18.500 --> 10:19.560]  People... Here's why.
[10:19.620 --> 10:20.380]  Here's why it's selling out.
[10:20.680 --> 10:22.860]  People value value.
[10:22.980 --> 10:23.140]  What?
[10:23.480 --> 10:24.460]  What happened?
[10:25.360 --> 10:27.200]  I thought... I'm like, well, I'll do an hour.
[10:27.460 --> 10:30.000]  Because it'll take, like, 25 minutes to, like, really get going.
[10:31.400 --> 10:32.120]  Jesus Christ.
[10:32.780 --> 10:33.420]  That's amazing.
[10:33.600 --> 10:35.120]  Thank you for the support, because Eric hates you.
[10:35.180 --> 10:35.920]  I love you all.
[10:36.000 --> 10:36.360]  Why?
[10:36.460 --> 10:37.420]  I'm pretty clear that he...
[10:37.420 --> 10:38.500]  Why did, um...
[10:39.280 --> 10:40.640]  Why can't we get this show greenlit?
[10:41.160 --> 10:43.380]  I don't know why we can't get this show greenlit.
[10:43.900 --> 10:45.720]  Here's a little sausage talk.
[10:45.720 --> 10:49.380]  I've been trying to make this a weekly show for almost a year.
[10:50.360 --> 10:53.020]  And now the only way I can do it is if we sell product through it.
[10:53.100 --> 10:54.700]  I just want to do it every Friday.
[10:55.280 --> 10:56.280]  Or every Wednesday.
[10:56.660 --> 11:00.660]  I want to do this for 90 minutes, 60 to 90 minutes, once a week, every week.
[11:00.680 --> 11:01.280]  Oh my God!
[11:01.700 --> 11:04.700]  At a company that I fucking started.
[11:05.080 --> 11:06.800]  At a company that I co-founded.
[11:07.000 --> 11:07.720]  I don't know why.
[11:08.300 --> 11:09.480]  But whatever, it's fine.
[11:10.200 --> 11:10.940]  Chaz Palminteri.
[11:11.100 --> 11:12.240]  Hey, that's a good one!
[11:12.420 --> 11:13.080]  That is a good one.
[11:13.300 --> 11:14.840]  A little bit of Chaz Palminteri trivia.
[11:14.840 --> 11:17.640]  I went to see the movie Hurley Burley.
[11:17.820 --> 11:20.080]  And he was so bad in it, I left.
[11:20.200 --> 11:23.140]  And it's one of the only films I've walked out of in my life.
[11:23.180 --> 11:26.180]  Hey, right after we get through the rest of these cards, we're going to give you a sneak peek at something.
[11:26.340 --> 11:26.540]  Okay.
[11:26.760 --> 11:27.700]  There's John Cusack.
[11:27.740 --> 11:28.000]  Oh!
[11:28.220 --> 11:29.200]  Gross Point Blanket.
[11:29.860 --> 11:31.420]  You know, I've been hanging out in Gross Point.
[11:31.780 --> 11:32.560]  It's pretty cool.
[11:32.740 --> 11:33.760]  No assassins yet.
[11:34.480 --> 11:35.600]  No Dan Aykroyd.
[11:36.660 --> 11:37.220]  He's great.
[11:37.480 --> 11:38.180]  He's really good.
[11:38.240 --> 11:38.940]  He's got that haircut.
[11:39.220 --> 11:39.520]  Oh man.
[11:39.520 --> 11:44.620]  Oh, Taron Manning from NYPD Blue.
[11:45.160 --> 11:47.080]  There's another banger for you.
[11:47.340 --> 11:47.740]  Cool.
[11:48.100 --> 11:48.980]  Palminteri and Manning.
[11:49.520 --> 11:49.780]  Okay.
[11:50.120 --> 11:50.680]  Trash pile.
[11:50.840 --> 11:55.180]  So, because you sold these so fast, and we had to figure something out, you can buy the rug.
[11:55.260 --> 11:55.900]  The rug's on sale.
[11:56.440 --> 11:57.440]  We got this rug back here.
[11:57.780 --> 11:58.480]  VCK rug.
[11:58.740 --> 11:59.440]  VCK rug.
[11:59.580 --> 12:00.140]  Good looking rug.
[12:00.280 --> 12:00.800]  Great rug.
[12:01.080 --> 12:02.340]  You know where I use it?
[12:02.560 --> 12:02.720]  Yeah.
[12:02.840 --> 12:03.880]  I use it under my desk.
[12:03.960 --> 12:04.440]  I use it...
[12:04.440 --> 12:05.700]  To put my feet on, under the desk.
[12:05.780 --> 12:08.340]  My wife doesn't like it in our little hallway, so it goes in our bathroom.
[12:08.340 --> 12:09.120]  Oh, yeah.
[12:09.160 --> 12:10.440]  It works great as a bathroom rug.
[12:10.440 --> 12:10.700]  It's great.
[12:10.820 --> 12:13.000]  I use it as a front door mat for a while.
[12:13.120 --> 12:13.560]  That's also nice.
[12:13.600 --> 12:14.140]  But it gets dirty.
[12:14.240 --> 12:15.000]  I don't want it to be dirty.
[12:15.140 --> 12:16.720]  The monkey face one?
[12:16.980 --> 12:17.080]  Yeah.
[12:17.360 --> 12:20.120]  You put it in the shower, and then you walk out, and you go, hi, Nick.
[12:20.200 --> 12:20.940]  And then...
[12:20.940 --> 12:21.600]  That's a different show.
[12:21.720 --> 12:21.940]  Yeah.
[12:22.040 --> 12:22.580]  Well, that's fine.
[12:22.780 --> 12:25.000]  Hey, because you sold that out so fast, VCK rug.
[12:25.080 --> 12:25.300]  Great.
[12:25.440 --> 12:26.040]  It's on sale now.
[12:27.040 --> 12:27.500]  Geoff, we have...
[12:27.500 --> 12:28.120]  It's not a vinyl.
[12:28.440 --> 12:28.680]  No.
[12:28.980 --> 12:29.320]  It's not.
[12:29.660 --> 12:32.060]  We have something that will be coming at the...
[12:32.060 --> 12:33.520]  We can announce the end of June.
[12:34.020 --> 12:36.300]  I think June 23rd is the official date.
[12:36.300 --> 12:41.240]  We have the Gerpler, Gerplers.
[12:41.540 --> 12:42.880]  We have the green.
[12:43.180 --> 12:43.900]  Green Gerpler.
[12:44.240 --> 12:45.620]  We also have the purple.
[12:45.960 --> 12:46.540]  Purple-er.
[12:47.820 --> 12:48.260]  So...
[12:48.260 --> 12:49.440]  Can you actually put one in the other?
[12:49.500 --> 12:50.420]  I want to see what Gerple looks like.
[12:51.140 --> 12:52.400]  And that is true Gerple.
[12:53.020 --> 12:54.580]  Here's the thing about the Gerpler.
[12:55.560 --> 12:56.900]  You don't pick the color.
[12:57.000 --> 12:57.660]  I believe it's randomized.
[12:57.960 --> 12:58.280]  Yes.
[12:59.240 --> 12:59.680]  Because...
[12:59.680 --> 13:01.560]  We made 500 and 500.
[13:01.640 --> 13:01.840]  Uh-huh.
[13:02.040 --> 13:04.140]  So, we also made...
[13:04.140 --> 13:05.020]  And I don't have them.
[13:05.020 --> 13:07.440]  I cannot show them to you because we do not physically have them.
[13:07.640 --> 13:08.160]  We won't get them.
[13:08.240 --> 13:08.320]  Yeah.
[13:08.360 --> 13:09.040]  We won't get them.
[13:09.180 --> 13:10.320]  They're that rare and exclusive.
[13:10.540 --> 13:14.380]  There are 10 golden Gerplers.
[13:14.620 --> 13:15.240]  Dude, if you put both...
[13:15.240 --> 13:15.840]  You can hear the ocean.
[13:15.960 --> 13:16.240]  Great.
[13:16.380 --> 13:17.180]  That's fantastic.
[13:17.760 --> 13:19.080]  10 golden Gerplers.
[13:20.500 --> 13:25.240]  Within those golden Gerplers lies a special USB.
[13:25.860 --> 13:26.040]  Yes.
[13:26.040 --> 13:27.600]  There are only 10 in existence.
[13:28.300 --> 13:32.760]  On the USB is an exclusive video that are only on the USB.
[13:33.120 --> 13:33.440]  Yes.
[13:33.440 --> 13:36.160]  They are all watermarked individually.
[13:36.420 --> 13:36.840]  Are they really?
[13:37.080 --> 13:37.200]  Yes.
[13:38.140 --> 13:41.860]  So, we will know golden Gerpler 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, all the way through 10.
[13:42.680 --> 13:47.940]  What you do with that video, if you get the golden Gerpler, what you do with that video is up to you.
[13:48.020 --> 13:48.620]  That's your video.
[13:48.820 --> 13:49.200]  You bought it.
[13:49.440 --> 13:50.240]  It can be yours.
[13:50.420 --> 13:51.900]  And you can hang on to it forever.
[13:52.740 --> 13:54.080]  You can put it online.
[13:54.740 --> 13:57.500]  We will know which Gerp put it online.
[13:58.460 --> 14:00.420]  And that's not a bad thing.
[14:00.440 --> 14:01.200]  This is the same...
[14:01.200 --> 14:02.060]  We won't be upset with you.
[14:02.060 --> 14:03.000]  This is the same...
[14:03.000 --> 14:03.500]  We will just know who it was.
[14:03.540 --> 14:04.340]  And we need you to know.
[14:04.460 --> 14:05.620]  It's like comment lever.
[14:06.100 --> 14:06.280]  Yeah.
[14:06.420 --> 14:07.800]  There's nothing wrong with being a comment lever.
[14:08.180 --> 14:09.260]  That's just what you are.
[14:09.560 --> 14:14.920]  If you are the person who got the golden Gerpler, and you put the video online, we know it's you.
[14:15.580 --> 14:16.380]  We know it's you.
[14:16.640 --> 14:17.520]  And that's fine.
[14:19.100 --> 14:21.640]  You might be a goddamn hero to the rest of the community.
[14:21.680 --> 14:22.400]  It could be.
[14:22.620 --> 14:23.280]  It could be.
[14:23.460 --> 14:29.280]  Because that's the only way anybody is going to see the very, very, very special video.
[14:29.280 --> 14:29.540]  Video.
[14:29.900 --> 14:30.620]  It's a good video.
[14:30.620 --> 14:32.400]  We should not say what it is.
[14:32.460 --> 14:32.580]  I've never seen it.
[14:32.580 --> 14:33.520]  I've made it, but I've never seen it.
[14:33.640 --> 14:35.620]  So that will be June 23rd.
[14:36.220 --> 14:40.620]  Gerplers on sale with other stuff that we will come to announce a little bit closer.
[14:40.960 --> 14:43.340]  We're going to sell a thousand and ten of them.
[14:44.260 --> 14:47.120]  A thousand and ten people are going to be happy with their purchase.
[14:47.240 --> 14:48.600]  Because they're going to get a purple Gerpler.
[14:48.880 --> 14:50.220]  Or they're going to get a green Gerpler.
[14:51.660 --> 14:56.620]  Ten special lucky little boys and girls, and they's and them's, are going to have access to...
[14:58.060 --> 14:58.460]  Kaboom!
[14:58.860 --> 14:59.580]  A special video.
[14:59.580 --> 15:00.880]  Pussy sleigh.
[15:00.880 --> 15:01.480]  Pussy sleigh.
[15:01.600 --> 15:01.860]  There you go.
[15:01.900 --> 15:03.260]  From the words of Gus Sirola himself.
[15:03.380 --> 15:04.680]  So that will be June 23rd.
[15:05.000 --> 15:06.320]  But all the vinyls are sold out.
[15:06.340 --> 15:06.680]  I'm sorry.
[15:07.120 --> 15:07.500]  Yeah.
[15:07.760 --> 15:08.720]  We should have made more.
[15:08.800 --> 15:09.480]  How many did we make?
[15:10.000 --> 15:10.520]  Not enough.
[15:10.860 --> 15:11.580]  And I'm just saying.
[15:11.740 --> 15:12.000]  Yeah.
[15:12.140 --> 15:12.880]  Here's my card.
[15:13.080 --> 15:13.260]  Yeah.
[15:13.340 --> 15:14.620]  Go to the fanciest restaurant in town.
[15:14.700 --> 15:15.100]  Yeah!
[15:16.240 --> 15:16.840]  All right.
[15:17.720 --> 15:24.020]  8-4-2-4-5-6-8-4-2-1-1-0-0-3.
[15:24.400 --> 15:24.800]  Eric.
[15:25.020 --> 15:25.220]  Yeah.
[15:25.360 --> 15:26.240]  We're going to In-N-Out.
[15:26.460 --> 15:26.640]  Woo!
[15:27.500 --> 15:27.900]  Baby!
[15:27.900 --> 15:29.280]  We'll take you to California for you.
[15:30.520 --> 15:34.480]  Very, very thrilled with how these sold because I did not think that was going to happen.
[15:34.660 --> 15:34.760]  Yeah.
[15:34.880 --> 15:35.960]  Thank you so much for the support.
[15:36.060 --> 15:36.580]  We really appreciate it.
[15:36.600 --> 15:37.980]  And we hope you like episode 16.
[15:38.340 --> 15:39.340]  There's a...
[15:39.340 --> 15:43.080]  If you want to hear what's on that vinyl, you can listen to it right now.
[15:43.300 --> 15:45.160]  And you can speed it up 2%.
[15:45.600 --> 15:46.460]  It's not actually...
[15:46.460 --> 15:48.020]  I don't know what the sped up percentage is.
[15:48.080 --> 15:48.840]  But it's very minor.
[15:48.960 --> 15:49.500]  It's very minor.
[15:49.880 --> 15:50.580]  Here's the problem.
[15:51.120 --> 15:54.020]  You get like 54 minutes on a vinyl or something.
[15:54.140 --> 15:54.780]  58 minutes.
[15:54.980 --> 15:57.160]  And the episode was like an hour and four minutes.
[15:57.160 --> 15:57.800]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:57.800 --> 15:59.260]  And we couldn't find anywhere...
[15:59.260 --> 16:00.340]  Everything on it's gold.
[16:00.420 --> 16:00.560]  Yep.
[16:00.760 --> 16:01.940]  It's like, well, where do you want to cut?
[16:02.060 --> 16:03.000]  It's like the demo tapes.
[16:03.100 --> 16:04.040]  Everything on the tapes is gold.
[16:04.120 --> 16:04.900]  Yeah, it's all gold.
[16:05.100 --> 16:05.620]  It's all gold.
[16:06.060 --> 16:06.380]  It's all gold.
[16:06.800 --> 16:09.060]  So we figured out a creative way to fit it all on there.
[16:09.840 --> 16:11.660]  I don't know what is going to happen.
[16:12.460 --> 16:13.360]  I'll tell you what's going to happen right now.
[16:13.400 --> 16:13.540]  Yeah.
[16:13.820 --> 16:16.720]  We're going to open this pack of Gilded Age history cards.
[16:16.740 --> 16:16.920]  Whoa!
[16:16.920 --> 16:18.740]  Remember these historic autograph cards?
[16:18.800 --> 16:18.820]  Do you love...
[16:18.820 --> 16:19.620]  Griff, do you love history?
[16:20.020 --> 16:20.500]  Do you love...
[16:20.500 --> 16:21.620]  Are you a historian, as it were?
[16:21.680 --> 16:21.840]  Yep.
[16:22.220 --> 16:23.040]  A history buff?
[16:23.200 --> 16:23.440]  Yep.
[16:23.740 --> 16:25.560]  An autodidact, if you will?
[16:27.820 --> 16:28.400]  Oh, Griff.
[16:29.080 --> 16:32.000]  Biff Cannon's kid in Back to the Future 2 is named Griff.
[16:32.480 --> 16:34.400]  Alright, you know, Biff's kid is named Griff.
[16:34.660 --> 16:34.860]  What?
[16:35.160 --> 16:35.320]  Yeah.
[16:35.440 --> 16:37.160]  I'm talking to Griff, by the way, so...
[16:38.480 --> 16:39.160]  Okay, what do we got?
[16:39.520 --> 16:40.040]  Card one.
[16:41.860 --> 16:42.240]  Uh...
[16:43.500 --> 16:44.600]  I don't know what to do with this.
[16:44.860 --> 16:49.220]  This is Catherine Lee Bates, who looks a whole lot like Cathy Lee Bates,
[16:49.440 --> 16:53.000]  but I don't think it is because she died in 1929.
[16:53.120 --> 16:54.600]  Cathy Lee Bates is a time traveler.
[16:56.000 --> 16:56.480]  Uh...
[16:56.480 --> 16:57.900]  What the fuck is this show?
[16:58.380 --> 17:02.860]  Catherine Lee Bates, 1859 to 1929, was an American author and professor
[17:02.860 --> 17:05.300]  who was best known for writing the words to the anthem,
[17:05.420 --> 17:06.200]  America the Beautiful.
[17:06.200 --> 17:06.440]  What?
[17:06.660 --> 17:07.600]  Holy shit!
[17:09.780 --> 17:10.260]  Uh...
[17:10.260 --> 17:12.980]  Wow, we're talking about a fucking drop in that knowledge.
[17:13.020 --> 17:13.780]  These cards are insane.
[17:13.780 --> 17:18.520]  A trip to Pipe's Peak and her experiences during the 1893 economic depression
[17:20.000 --> 17:23.040]  inspired her to write the poem that would later become
[17:23.040 --> 17:25.160]  one of America's most beloved songs.
[17:25.320 --> 17:28.000]  She was also a noted speaker and author on social reform
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.900]  and now confirmed time traveler.
[17:31.400 --> 17:32.580]  Cathy Lee Bates, right there.
[17:32.900 --> 17:33.520]  Hey, Geoff.
[17:33.640 --> 17:35.240]  James Conn is sweating and he doesn't know why.
[17:36.120 --> 17:36.660]  What's up?
[17:37.580 --> 17:38.540]  Oh, you're kidding.
[17:39.140 --> 17:40.200]  I haven't seen this.
[17:40.600 --> 17:41.180]  Have you seen this?
[17:41.180 --> 17:41.760]  I haven't seen it.
[17:43.000 --> 17:43.820]  This is one of the ten?
[17:43.900 --> 17:44.740]  This is one of the ten.
[17:45.640 --> 17:46.180]  Do you want...
[17:46.180 --> 17:47.720]  Hey, do we have a silver Sharpie?
[17:49.480 --> 17:50.540]  Can you hand it to me?
[17:54.490 --> 17:55.150]  Thank you.
[17:55.230 --> 17:57.470]  We're gonna sign...
[17:57.470 --> 17:57.970]  Whoa!
[17:59.110 --> 18:00.070]  Golden Gerpler.
[18:05.490 --> 18:06.950]  That's really impressive.
[18:07.450 --> 18:08.130]  Can you get a close-up?
[18:10.870 --> 18:12.190]  Can we get a close-up on this?
[18:12.670 --> 18:13.370]  What's with the flies?
[18:13.670 --> 18:13.990]  I don't know.
[18:14.610 --> 18:16.110]  What the fuck did you give me?
[18:18.390 --> 18:20.210]  What the fuck is this?
[18:21.930 --> 18:23.390]  What the fuck happened?
[18:23.810 --> 18:24.630]  Hey, you have a Sharpie?
[18:24.810 --> 18:25.170]  Yeah.
[18:26.050 --> 18:26.630]  Do you?
[18:27.830 --> 18:29.310]  Are you kidding me?
[18:29.870 --> 18:31.030]  What the fuck is this?
[18:31.150 --> 18:31.950]  It's a Sharpie skin.
[18:32.070 --> 18:32.810]  Throw that away!
[18:34.130 --> 18:35.150]  That's a good catch, though.
[18:35.250 --> 18:37.750]  We're gonna sign this Golden Gerpler. It is one of one.
[18:39.090 --> 18:39.530]  Wow!
[18:40.110 --> 18:41.370]  We have not seen this.
[18:41.670 --> 18:42.410]  This is awesome.
[18:44.390 --> 18:45.990]  This is so cool.
[18:46.570 --> 18:48.290]  It's gonna go right back in the bag?
[18:48.370 --> 18:48.490]  Yep.
[18:48.690 --> 18:50.650]  So one of the ten...
[18:50.650 --> 18:53.470]  All ten were created equal until this moment.
[18:53.490 --> 18:54.090]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:54.090 --> 18:56.690]  Now there's one that's double-autoed.
[18:56.790 --> 18:59.270]  That's awesome. That's on-cup auto.
[19:00.810 --> 19:01.130]  Wow!
[19:01.450 --> 19:02.550]  Put that right back in there.
[19:02.710 --> 19:03.350]  You're gonna want this.
[19:03.390 --> 19:04.010]  You can deliver that to...
[19:04.010 --> 19:04.410]  It's the only one you got.
[19:05.130 --> 19:10.450]  Make sure Geoff Yetter gets that later and that'll go right into the pile with the others.
[19:11.030 --> 19:12.570]  I can't believe we actually got to see it.
[19:12.610 --> 19:13.410]  It just gets crazier.
[19:13.650 --> 19:13.710]  Yeah.
[19:13.810 --> 19:14.670]  What an episode this is.
[19:14.670 --> 19:17.610]  This is awesome. And we don't get to do this all the time?
[19:17.770 --> 19:20.090]  Hey, you know, that reminds me. I've been meaning to talk to you about this.
[19:20.150 --> 19:22.790]  The last one of these we did, we were selling something. What was that?
[19:22.790 --> 19:23.030]  Yeah.
[19:24.530 --> 19:24.850]  Koozies.
[19:25.010 --> 19:25.030]  Yeah.
[19:25.550 --> 19:25.870]  Jersey.
[19:26.010 --> 19:26.710]  Oh, that makes more sense.
[19:27.110 --> 19:28.270]  That's not available anywhere.
[19:28.750 --> 19:29.450]  It's not on YouTube.
[19:29.690 --> 19:29.970]  Oh, really?
[19:30.030 --> 19:32.070]  And it's not on the site archive, I don't think.
[19:32.110 --> 19:32.430]  Oh, that's weird.
[19:32.430 --> 19:35.430]  We should make sure that goes up, because that was another banger of an episode.
[19:36.130 --> 19:36.450]  Woolworths.
[19:38.690 --> 19:39.650]  There you go, right there.
[19:39.810 --> 19:41.350]  Anyone tell you you're just great at transitions?
[19:41.490 --> 19:41.790]  Thanks, man.
[19:42.490 --> 19:42.810]  Woolworths.
[19:43.430 --> 19:44.470]  I pride myself on it.
[19:46.050 --> 19:46.690]  Frank Furness.
[19:46.850 --> 19:49.350]  We gotta make sure we release that Woolworths.
[19:49.350 --> 19:53.570]  It is at Woolworths, and then their old competitor, Frank Furness.
[19:53.930 --> 19:56.590]  People were Woolworths people, or they were Frank Furness people.
[19:56.590 --> 20:00.850]  So, like, 1902 or whatever, if you were doing a mall draft, would it be this?
[20:01.390 --> 20:03.850]  Yeah, this would be Gavin's pick, this would be mine.
[20:04.090 --> 20:06.190]  I don't know what Frank Furness is. I doubt it's a store.
[20:11.090 --> 20:12.290]  I guess it's a dude.
[20:13.350 --> 20:14.250]  It's a building.
[20:15.050 --> 20:16.270]  I didn't see a picture of him.
[20:16.270 --> 20:16.890]  It's a fucking building.
[20:16.890 --> 20:20.350]  But he fought for the Union in the Civil War and received the Medal of Honor, there you go.
[20:20.410 --> 20:21.650]  And I guess they named a building after him.
[20:22.390 --> 20:23.850]  Maybe he invented furnaces.
[20:25.650 --> 20:26.290]  Eiffel Tower.
[20:27.470 --> 20:29.730]  You ever been to Paris? You ever seen the Eiffel Tower up close?
[20:30.390 --> 20:31.490]  It's fucking big.
[20:31.590 --> 20:32.770]  You ever been to the top of the Eiffel Tower?
[20:32.910 --> 20:34.050]  Craziest fucking pick, of course.
[20:34.230 --> 20:37.710]  I was reading recently that Eiffel had an apartment up there.
[20:38.710 --> 20:39.690]  Is Eiffel a man?
[20:40.050 --> 20:41.730]  Yeah, it was named after him. It was his tower.
[20:41.930 --> 20:42.770]  I don't believe this.
[20:42.850 --> 20:44.570]  Is this, like, Frank Furness or whatever?
[20:44.570 --> 20:46.350]  No, Eiffel is a real dude.
[20:49.170 --> 20:50.850]  Gustav Eiffel was his name.
[20:51.090 --> 20:52.990]  It's on the back! Gustav Eiffel.
[20:55.850 --> 20:57.530]  Moses Fleetwood Walker.
[20:59.410 --> 21:00.170]  Baseball man?
[21:00.490 --> 21:02.710]  I guess so, yeah. He played baseball.
[21:03.230 --> 21:06.590]  First black player in Major League Baseball was born in Mount Pleasant, Ohio.
[21:08.010 --> 21:08.570]  1924.
[21:09.830 --> 21:15.550]  He batted .263, but only played 42 games due to injuries that ultimately ended with his release.
[21:15.650 --> 21:16.730]  Yeah, this fucking sucks, man.
[21:17.130 --> 21:19.550]  It sucks to see talent lost to injury.
[21:20.310 --> 21:20.990]  Buster Posey.
[21:21.050 --> 21:22.390]  Greg Oden, Buster Posey.
[21:22.530 --> 21:23.230]  There's a lot of them like that.
[21:23.730 --> 21:27.930]  Here we go. Oh, this is a special Victorian pin-up girl's Gilded Age card.
[21:28.630 --> 21:30.290]  We allowed you to show that? Oh my goodness.
[21:31.430 --> 21:38.170]  If this was, I don't know, the 19th century, you would be rock hard right now.
[21:38.170 --> 21:39.390]  That's crazy.
[21:40.010 --> 21:41.530]  Coca-Cola, syrup and extract.
[21:43.090 --> 21:44.930]  These cards are fucking insane.
[21:45.490 --> 21:47.130]  You familiar with Coca-Cola?
[21:47.370 --> 21:47.890]  I've heard of it.
[21:47.890 --> 21:49.430]  That's what the ads looked like back in the day.
[21:49.610 --> 21:49.830]  Oh boy.
[21:49.970 --> 21:51.110]  They've really improved.
[21:51.290 --> 21:56.650]  I'd like to buy the World of Coke as a major upgrade from...
[21:56.650 --> 21:58.030]  Get your syrup and extract.
[21:59.590 --> 22:00.850]  Boston Symphony Orchestra.
[22:01.650 --> 22:02.990]  Everybody in this photo is dead.
[22:04.290 --> 22:05.290]  First Groundhog Day.
[22:05.430 --> 22:06.670]  Boy, that comes up a lot, doesn't it?
[22:06.670 --> 22:08.150]  And here we are again with the first Groundhog Day.
[22:08.270 --> 22:09.030]  Is that Groundhog Alive?
[22:09.090 --> 22:10.670]  That's the one where we got the 101 last time.
[22:11.310 --> 22:13.310]  No, that groundhog died 100 years ago.
[22:13.830 --> 22:15.290]  And then the Dreyfuss Affair.
[22:15.670 --> 22:18.950]  I think we all remember the time that Richard Dreyfuss...
[22:18.950 --> 22:19.850]  Richard Dreyfuss!
[22:20.650 --> 22:21.510]  ...had that affair.
[22:21.730 --> 22:23.190]  Are you the guy that hates Richard Dreyfuss?
[22:23.430 --> 22:24.150]  I don't hate him.
[22:24.210 --> 22:26.250]  Oh, I feel like I know someone who does not like Richard Dreyfuss.
[22:26.570 --> 22:31.570]  I think he's kind of turned into a surly old dude.
[22:31.630 --> 22:32.550]  He is, it's really crazy.
[22:32.670 --> 22:34.670]  He's kind of got a disgruntled, surly...
[22:35.070 --> 22:36.790]  Grandpa, keep your opinions to yourself, kind of.
[22:36.830 --> 22:37.750]  Everybody loves your movies.
[22:38.250 --> 22:39.930]  Just shut up and let us watch Mr. Holland's Opus.
[22:40.030 --> 22:42.430]  Hey, I was told that if you're looking for something to buy,
[22:42.490 --> 22:44.870]  still, the RTX poster went on sale, so you can buy that.
[22:44.990 --> 22:45.570]  Oh, that's very cool.
[22:45.590 --> 22:47.270]  You don't have to zoom in on this, I'm just holding up my phone.
[22:49.170 --> 22:52.770]  July 7th through 9th is RTX, and this poster says Therapy Gecko.
[22:53.050 --> 22:54.330]  I don't know if that's announced, but I said it.
[22:55.230 --> 22:57.490]  Jesus. Wasn't Therapy Gecko supposed to come last year?
[22:57.690 --> 22:58.150]  I don't know.
[22:58.230 --> 22:58.690]  Something happened.
[22:58.850 --> 22:59.870]  I don't know how the fuck this works.
[23:01.930 --> 23:03.610]  It does not matter to me if it's okay.
[23:04.110 --> 23:06.650]  I'm just letting you know, that's fine.
[23:06.810 --> 23:07.530]  He doesn't care.
[23:07.930 --> 23:09.050]  The poster's out!
[23:10.030 --> 23:11.330]  It wouldn't matter!
[23:11.630 --> 23:13.310]  It just sounded like you were asking for permission.
[23:13.410 --> 23:15.250]  No! I'm never asking for permission.
[23:15.910 --> 23:16.390]  Again.
[23:16.750 --> 23:16.950]  Yep.
[23:18.170 --> 23:22.750]  So, go to store.richchief.com and then get this poster,
[23:22.890 --> 23:25.450]  and then also go to rtxaustin.com and buy tickets,
[23:25.550 --> 23:26.610]  and then come to...
[23:27.810 --> 23:29.230]  RTX, in Austin.
[23:29.230 --> 23:32.590]  Yeah, and we're going to have the...
[23:32.590 --> 23:33.710]  They keep asking for pictures!
[23:34.090 --> 23:34.950]  And the items!
[23:35.810 --> 23:38.090]  Here's the thing about RTX.
[23:39.130 --> 23:40.870]  It's July 7th, 8th, and 9th.
[23:40.910 --> 23:41.190]  It is.
[23:41.190 --> 23:41.890]  That's what you need to know.
[23:42.390 --> 23:45.090]  So, clear your calendar, because you're going to want to come down to Austin, Texas,
[23:45.150 --> 23:47.230]  because you're going to want to go to the...
[23:49.090 --> 23:51.290]  museum of oddities and things that are things.
[23:51.610 --> 23:52.390]  You're going to see...
[23:52.950 --> 23:54.770]  You'll probably see some of the stuff on the table right here.
[23:54.850 --> 23:55.890]  There'll probably be some Gerplers.
[23:55.950 --> 23:57.950]  You're going to see the rock from my backyard.
[23:58.090 --> 23:58.470]  It's true.
[23:58.790 --> 24:00.390]  I need to take a photo of that and give it to Wes.
[24:00.450 --> 24:02.230]  You're going to see Don Zimmer cards.
[24:02.310 --> 24:05.390]  You're going to see whatever other crap he said we were going to put in there.
[24:05.450 --> 24:07.890]  I think Thrice to Meet You, the prototype, is going to be there.
[24:07.910 --> 24:08.490]  There's a lot of stuff.
[24:08.590 --> 24:10.150]  And one special item.
[24:10.450 --> 24:11.290]  You have to see it.
[24:11.390 --> 24:13.030]  You have to see to believe.
[24:13.310 --> 24:17.030]  You can probably guess what it is, but I'm not going to say what it is.
[24:17.030 --> 24:17.950]  We legally...
[24:17.950 --> 24:19.470]  Keep the intrigue high.
[24:19.550 --> 24:22.910]  We legally can say what we're not going to do.
[24:24.310 --> 24:25.270]  What we are going to do...
[24:25.670 --> 24:26.850]  Is open another pack of cards.
[24:26.850 --> 24:28.770]  Open up a pack of wrestling cards.
[24:28.830 --> 24:31.310]  Are you guys familiar with the World Wrestling Entertainment?
[24:31.410 --> 24:31.890]  I am.
[24:32.310 --> 24:34.330]  I'm more of an AEW guy, but that's fine.
[24:34.550 --> 24:35.970]  How do you feel about Cedric Alexander?
[24:36.090 --> 24:37.310]  I like Cedric Alexander.
[24:37.730 --> 24:38.850]  How do you feel about...
[24:39.950 --> 24:40.490]  Uh-huh.
[24:41.290 --> 24:42.730]  Are you going to show me Finn Balor?
[24:42.970 --> 24:44.590]  The demon, Finn Balor.
[24:44.710 --> 24:45.570]  Yeah, that's...
[24:45.570 --> 24:48.110]  Whatever it takes, I guess.
[24:49.490 --> 24:49.870]  Yeah.
[24:50.350 --> 24:52.690]  Does he put that shit on every time he wrestles?
[24:52.690 --> 24:54.930]  No, he only is sometimes like that.
[24:54.930 --> 24:55.750]  He only is...
[24:55.750 --> 24:57.150]  Usually, he's just a normal man.
[24:57.230 --> 24:58.410]  I bet you would hate wrestling him.
[24:58.490 --> 25:00.670]  Because you come back looking like you tried to shine your shoes.
[25:00.870 --> 25:01.030]  Oh, yeah.
[25:01.190 --> 25:03.230]  Yeah, he's just covered and it all comes off.
[25:03.290 --> 25:03.850]  It's a whole thing.
[25:04.050 --> 25:05.050]  Yeah, it's pretty...
[25:05.050 --> 25:05.590]  It's pretty tough.
[25:05.710 --> 25:08.030]  He's no Lacey Evans.
[25:08.690 --> 25:10.050]  Lacey Evans has...
[25:10.050 --> 25:11.930]  Her finishing move is...
[25:12.690 --> 25:13.930]  A closed fist, like, punch.
[25:14.050 --> 25:14.870]  To, like, knock you out.
[25:14.970 --> 25:15.510]  And it's called...
[25:15.510 --> 25:16.650]  It's called Women's Right.
[25:16.990 --> 25:18.410]  And I think that's so funny.
[25:18.850 --> 25:20.110]  I'm all for Women's Rights.
[25:20.390 --> 25:20.710]  Crack!
[25:20.730 --> 25:21.830]  So it's like a one inch, like...
[25:22.370 --> 25:23.210]  No, no.
[25:23.290 --> 25:24.290]  She just fucking clocks it.
[25:24.290 --> 25:24.730]  Oh, okay.
[25:24.790 --> 25:25.370]  It's pretty great.
[25:25.530 --> 25:25.670]  Yeah.
[25:26.070 --> 25:26.470]  It's pretty good.
[25:27.250 --> 25:27.890]  Sonia Deville!
[25:28.430 --> 25:28.750]  MMA fighter.
[25:29.290 --> 25:29.670]  Oh, really?
[25:29.790 --> 25:30.610]  Yeah, used to be an MMA fighter.
[25:30.730 --> 25:31.130]  Oh, wow.
[25:31.310 --> 25:31.670]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25:31.710 --> 25:32.630]  So she was a real fighter.
[25:32.790 --> 25:33.030]  Yes.
[25:33.190 --> 25:33.850]  Now she's a wrestler.
[25:34.090 --> 25:34.390]  Yes.
[25:34.450 --> 25:34.950]  That's cool.
[25:35.030 --> 25:35.410]  That's how it goes.
[25:36.130 --> 25:37.130]  I want to get...
[25:37.130 --> 25:38.050]  There's AEW cards.
[25:38.090 --> 25:39.230]  I want to get those and open them on here.
[25:39.390 --> 25:40.510]  Yeah, well, we've had some before.
[25:40.630 --> 25:42.930]  Yeah, and we will once we have this as a weekly show.
[25:43.130 --> 25:44.770]  Do you know what I have that I'm excited about?
[25:44.770 --> 25:44.990]  What's that?
[25:45.030 --> 25:47.250]  Not for today, but for next time we do the big show.
[25:49.170 --> 25:52.350]  And hopefully Emily can be in attendance to run the boards.
[25:52.350 --> 25:56.390]  Because she is obsessed with Hasbulla.
[25:57.150 --> 25:57.930]  Oh, really?
[25:58.330 --> 25:59.010]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25:59.510 --> 26:05.560]  And the newest batch of Panini UFC prism cards includes Hasbulla autographs.
[26:06.290 --> 26:06.730]  No way!
[26:06.850 --> 26:08.810]  Yeah, it's the first Hasbulla card, first autograph.
[26:09.090 --> 26:09.650]  Oh, my God.
[26:09.830 --> 26:10.530]  Hasbulla rookie?
[26:11.130 --> 26:12.610]  They have been selling...
[26:12.610 --> 26:13.630]  I've been tracking it on eBay.
[26:14.050 --> 26:15.830]  One just sold for $15,000.
[26:16.350 --> 26:16.710]  Whoa!
[26:16.710 --> 26:18.710]  And the one before it sold for $12,000.
[26:19.050 --> 26:20.750]  So I bought a hobby box of that shit.
[26:20.750 --> 26:23.090]  And it's been sitting in my house for a month.
[26:23.210 --> 26:24.270]  Well, since April.
[26:24.710 --> 26:25.890]  But not quite a month.
[26:26.210 --> 26:29.630]  But I'm dying to open it, but I want to open it on camera.
[26:29.690 --> 26:29.970]  Let's do it.
[26:29.970 --> 26:33.430]  Because when we get a $15,000 Hasbulla auto, I'm going to lose my mind.
[26:33.850 --> 26:35.070]  Let's open some sports cards.
[26:35.250 --> 26:35.390]  Okay.
[26:35.850 --> 26:36.830]  Hey, Celtics still in it, bud.
[26:39.750 --> 26:40.310]  What's up?
[26:40.490 --> 26:41.790]  They're going to the finals, baby!
[26:42.070 --> 26:44.750]  At this point, I think we're playing...
[26:47.010 --> 26:48.110]  Each successive win...
[26:48.110 --> 26:49.090]  I don't think we're going to win the series.
[26:49.090 --> 26:50.790]  Nobody's ever come back from down 3-0.
[26:50.890 --> 26:52.290]  Except for the Red Sox, of course.
[26:53.710 --> 26:54.070]  But...
[26:54.070 --> 26:54.630]  Same sport.
[26:54.750 --> 26:55.570]  Different sport, right?
[26:55.570 --> 26:55.850]  Oh, right.
[26:56.070 --> 27:02.350]  So what we're playing for is each successive game lessens the chance that Joe's going to get fired.
[27:02.910 --> 27:03.870]  Jalen's going to get traded.
[27:04.190 --> 27:05.170]  Marcus is going to get traded.
[27:05.590 --> 27:06.790]  Rob Williams is going to get traded.
[27:06.950 --> 27:08.130]  Grant Williams is going to get traded.
[27:08.390 --> 27:11.490]  So it's like, I want them to win tonight.
[27:11.590 --> 27:13.750]  Obviously, I want them to win because I want them to win.
[27:13.770 --> 27:14.590]  They're my favorite team.
[27:14.890 --> 27:17.990]  But I more want them to win so we can retain pieces that I like.
[27:18.030 --> 27:18.210]  Yeah.
[27:18.210 --> 27:20.190]  I get that.
[27:22.790 --> 27:23.150]  So...
[27:23.150 --> 27:24.870]  Phoenix Suns going to hire Doc Rivers or what?
[27:25.910 --> 27:27.390]  Doc says he still wants to coach.
[27:27.510 --> 27:29.330]  I can't believe they fired Money Williams.
[27:29.610 --> 27:30.690]  One of the best coaches in the NBA.
[27:30.850 --> 27:32.570]  And I can't believe he hasn't already been picked up.
[27:32.630 --> 27:33.270]  I just don't know...
[27:34.170 --> 27:35.650]  I don't get why and then I don't...
[27:35.650 --> 27:37.310]  If one of those teams hires...
[27:38.150 --> 27:39.630]  What, three teams fire their coaches?
[27:39.790 --> 27:40.330]  If one of those...
[27:40.330 --> 27:44.550]  If one of the other two teams picks up Doc Rivers, it's like, why would you do this?
[27:44.650 --> 27:44.730]  Yeah.
[27:45.670 --> 27:46.570]  Trust the process.
[27:46.630 --> 27:47.210]  Until the playoffs.
[27:47.210 --> 27:49.630]  You know, I'm not a huge Golden State Warriors fan.
[27:50.690 --> 27:53.110]  But respect what some of them have done.
[27:53.110 --> 27:53.150]  Understand.
[27:53.650 --> 27:54.550]  Respect Steve Kerr.
[27:54.630 --> 27:55.970]  Yeah, Draymond Green, absolutely.
[27:56.870 --> 27:58.070]  And Kerr had a comment.
[27:58.230 --> 27:59.550]  He was like, they were asking about his future.
[27:59.610 --> 28:00.990]  And he's like, I don't know.
[28:01.110 --> 28:03.810]  He goes, every time I pick up my phone, a Hall of Fame coach just got fired.
[28:03.930 --> 28:06.550]  So, I don't feel really good about anybody's future.
[28:06.850 --> 28:07.210]  Yep, yep.
[28:07.290 --> 28:08.230]  And I'm like, I feel that.
[28:08.530 --> 28:09.250]  It's a smart...
[28:10.030 --> 28:11.370]  Bones Highland, base rookie.
[28:11.570 --> 28:12.210]  Great name.
[28:12.530 --> 28:13.450]  He's already...
[28:13.450 --> 28:13.870]  That's his...
[28:13.870 --> 28:15.030]  I think he plays for the Clippers now.
[28:15.030 --> 28:15.710]  Do we hang on to Bones?
[28:15.710 --> 28:17.230]  Yeah, we can hang on to Bones.
[28:17.330 --> 28:17.830]  I like this.
[28:18.030 --> 28:18.270]  Good name.
[28:18.370 --> 28:19.970]  I got a Bones autograph the other day.
[28:20.050 --> 28:20.730]  You got Bones autograph?
[28:20.830 --> 28:21.290]  Yeah, I think so.
[28:21.730 --> 28:22.530]  Nikola Vucevic.
[28:23.530 --> 28:24.330]  The Vooch.
[28:26.070 --> 28:27.930]  Brandon Boston Jr., base rookie.
[28:28.670 --> 28:29.470]  Cole Anthony.
[28:30.430 --> 28:30.830]  That...
[28:30.830 --> 28:31.910]  What's that pose?
[28:32.210 --> 28:33.510]  If I recall, Anthony...
[28:33.510 --> 28:34.650]  That's like a pirouette, kind of.
[28:35.030 --> 28:38.030]  If I recall, Anthony, I would name myself Cole Blooded.
[28:38.730 --> 28:39.490]  That's pretty cool.
[28:39.570 --> 28:39.950]  That's my nickname, Cole Blooded.
[28:39.950 --> 28:40.370]  That's pretty good.
[28:40.370 --> 28:42.130]  And when I would shoot, I'd go, Cole Blooded!
[28:42.850 --> 28:43.650]  And then...
[28:43.650 --> 28:44.030]  Brick.
[28:44.630 --> 28:45.970]  Shot clock violation.
[28:46.550 --> 28:47.450]  Moses Moody.
[28:47.670 --> 28:47.990]  Nice.
[28:48.190 --> 28:49.370]  I'd call myself...
[28:49.370 --> 28:50.130]  The Ark.
[28:51.310 --> 28:52.030]  Oh, that's...
[28:52.030 --> 28:52.290]  Yeah.
[28:52.430 --> 28:53.730]  Yeah, Moses Ark.
[28:53.890 --> 28:53.970]  Yeah.
[28:55.370 --> 28:56.410]  Bogdan Bogdanovich.
[28:57.170 --> 28:57.650]  That's...
[28:57.650 --> 28:59.330]  I mean, like...
[28:59.330 --> 29:00.310]  Best name?
[29:01.530 --> 29:02.450]  Bogdan Bogdanovich?
[29:02.510 --> 29:02.670]  Yeah.
[29:02.930 --> 29:03.130]  Yeah.
[29:03.330 --> 29:05.510]  That's like if your name is Geoff Geofferson.
[29:05.810 --> 29:06.350]  Geoff Geofferson.
[29:07.350 --> 29:09.530]  Well, there's Bogdan and Boban.
[29:09.610 --> 29:10.290]  And there's so many...
[29:10.690 --> 29:12.470]  Bogdanovich is a popular name in the NBA these days.
[29:12.470 --> 29:13.870]  Duncan Robinson.
[29:14.470 --> 29:14.870]  Nice.
[29:15.430 --> 29:16.190]  Fuck him.
[29:16.470 --> 29:16.570]  Oh.
[29:16.870 --> 29:17.590]  Kimba Walker.
[29:18.790 --> 29:19.550]  Oh, shit.
[29:20.050 --> 29:20.270]  Oh!
[29:21.430 --> 29:21.870]  Alright.
[29:22.230 --> 29:23.130]  We got something.
[29:23.450 --> 29:24.110]  We got something.
[29:24.210 --> 29:24.630]  Here we go.
[29:25.110 --> 29:25.330]  Ready?
[29:25.410 --> 29:28.530]  We just got a legitimate fucking huge hit.
[29:28.610 --> 29:28.810]  Okay.
[29:29.030 --> 29:29.830]  We're gonna open that lap.
[29:29.870 --> 29:30.530]  We're gonna show that lap.
[29:30.550 --> 29:31.490]  Whoa, that's awesome.
[29:31.890 --> 29:32.490]  Show that lap.
[29:32.570 --> 29:33.750]  Maybe that's how you tease it.
[29:34.010 --> 29:34.190]  Alright.
[29:34.430 --> 29:37.270]  Here's a SGA parallel express lane.
[29:37.630 --> 29:38.650]  Shy Gilgis Alexander.
[29:38.650 --> 29:44.950]  I don't understand why the world hasn't woken up to the fact that he is one of the six or seven best players in the NBA.
[29:45.150 --> 29:46.230]  Wow, because we had...
[29:46.230 --> 29:46.630]  And he's only getting better.
[29:46.690 --> 29:48.330]  Because we had nine MVPs this year.
[29:48.350 --> 29:48.890]  I guess that's true.
[29:49.290 --> 29:50.010]  Josh Christopher.
[29:50.810 --> 29:51.870]  Purple Prism rookie.
[29:53.190 --> 29:53.910]  Miles Turner.
[29:55.010 --> 29:56.390]  Pink Shock Prism maybe?
[29:56.510 --> 29:56.950]  Is that what that is?
[29:57.490 --> 29:58.210]  Christian Wood.
[29:58.950 --> 30:00.870]  And then Aaron Wiggins.
[30:01.010 --> 30:01.290]  Okay.
[30:01.490 --> 30:02.330]  Shock rookie as well.
[30:02.410 --> 30:03.350]  So, there's one...
[30:03.350 --> 30:04.010]  There's two cards here.
[30:04.030 --> 30:06.110]  You got one that you were just setting down on this one.
[30:06.150 --> 30:06.610]  Which is that?
[30:06.810 --> 30:06.990]  Yes.
[30:06.990 --> 30:07.250]  Which is?
[30:07.550 --> 30:09.890]  We got a Donovan Mitchell express lane parallel.
[30:10.350 --> 30:10.810]  Very nice, very nice.
[30:10.910 --> 30:11.630]  And you can see...
[30:11.630 --> 30:12.850]  Probably don't want to cover it up with your finger.
[30:12.970 --> 30:13.370]  There you go.
[30:13.670 --> 30:14.110]  And...
[30:14.110 --> 30:16.410]  And then behind that we have...
[30:16.790 --> 30:18.130]  Maybe the biggest hit we've ever had on this show.
[30:18.130 --> 30:18.450]  Really?
[30:18.650 --> 30:18.890]  Yeah.
[30:19.910 --> 30:20.790]  Cam Thomas.
[30:21.430 --> 30:23.690]  Pink parallel auto rookie.
[30:26.050 --> 30:27.450]  Number 16 of 25.
[30:27.670 --> 30:28.330]  Holy shit.
[30:28.610 --> 30:29.750]  Holy shit is right.
[30:30.230 --> 30:35.250]  Cam Thomas, not the most touted rookie in the world, but has done some really good work for Brooklyn.
[30:35.250 --> 30:38.050]  Especially considering the situation that they're in.
[30:38.430 --> 30:41.930]  To get a rookie parallel is a big deal.
[30:42.090 --> 30:44.890]  To get a numbered rookie parallel is a bigger deal.
[30:45.330 --> 30:49.850]  To get a numbered rookie auto parallel is an even bigger deal.
[30:49.970 --> 30:53.310]  And to get a low numbered rookie auto parallel is a huge deal.
[30:53.390 --> 30:54.030]  That's crazy.
[30:54.110 --> 30:54.430]  That is an absolute...
[30:55.070 --> 30:56.330]  That's a big get right there.
[30:56.870 --> 30:57.030]  Yeah.
[30:57.130 --> 30:57.270]  Damn.
[30:57.450 --> 30:57.830]  We actually...
[30:57.830 --> 30:58.630]  This was like worth it.
[30:58.670 --> 31:00.050]  It's a multi-hundred dollar card.
[31:00.250 --> 31:02.830]  I mean, I guess like selling the vinyl was worth it too.
[31:02.830 --> 31:05.390]  But like, I mean, this was what we were really here for.
[31:05.570 --> 31:07.530]  If Cam Thomas ever makes the all-star game...
[31:08.390 --> 31:08.750]  That's...
[31:09.750 --> 31:10.390]  Damn, dude.
[31:10.410 --> 31:11.230]  I was gonna...
[31:11.230 --> 31:11.810]  That might...
[31:11.810 --> 31:12.390]  Things get rough.
[31:12.470 --> 31:13.890]  Maybe that'll help Millie in college.
[31:13.990 --> 31:16.510]  Like in junior year or whatever when I'm having trouble making payments.
[31:17.350 --> 31:18.490]  We'll just sell more vinyl records.
[31:20.350 --> 31:21.130]  I'll tell you what, Eric.
[31:21.290 --> 31:22.370]  That was fun for sports.
[31:22.450 --> 31:23.530]  It's gonna be hard to top that.
[31:23.690 --> 31:25.730]  So let's dial it back a little bit.
[31:25.790 --> 31:27.350]  Let's open some vampire diaries.
[31:27.930 --> 31:28.290]  Okay.
[31:29.890 --> 31:31.570]  Here's a fun fact about the vampire diaries.
[31:31.570 --> 31:32.750]  I've never seen it.
[31:32.970 --> 31:33.330]  Yeah.
[31:33.530 --> 31:34.590]  You know who's...
[31:34.590 --> 31:35.410]  You know who's watched it?
[31:35.590 --> 31:35.810]  Michael.
[31:36.070 --> 31:36.430]  Michael.
[31:36.570 --> 31:37.130]  Michael Jones.
[31:37.270 --> 31:37.430]  Yeah.
[31:37.550 --> 31:39.730]  He'll tell me about what happens at the bar.
[31:41.770 --> 31:43.250]  Like you'll be at the bar and he'll tell you what happens?
[31:43.250 --> 31:43.550]  No, no.
[31:43.570 --> 31:44.250]  There's a bar.
[31:44.310 --> 31:45.370]  No, there's a bar there.
[31:45.470 --> 31:46.890]  Or like the cafe or like restaurant or whatever.
[31:46.950 --> 31:47.750]  And he'll tell me all about it.
[31:47.750 --> 31:48.530]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[31:48.630 --> 31:48.770]  Yeah.
[31:48.770 --> 31:50.030]  This was an unpleasant surprise.
[31:50.250 --> 31:50.450]  Oh.
[31:51.710 --> 31:52.070]  Surprise.
[31:52.270 --> 31:53.550]  I was hiding behind a tree.
[31:53.750 --> 31:55.230]  Love sucks is what it says.
[31:55.250 --> 31:55.830]  Yeah, it does.
[31:56.770 --> 31:58.790]  Oh, here's Bonnie, I guess.
[31:59.450 --> 32:00.430]  Old picture of Bonnie.
[32:00.430 --> 32:02.410]  Maybe she's a time traveler like Kathie Bates.
[32:07.530 --> 32:08.330]  Congratulations, graduates.
[32:08.710 --> 32:11.430]  Do you remember that time all the vampires graduated from vampire school?
[32:12.090 --> 32:12.870]  She walked.
[32:13.070 --> 32:13.750]  But it was at night.
[32:13.890 --> 32:14.690]  They had the ceremony at night.
[32:14.830 --> 32:16.990]  That looks like a real early 2000s haircut.
[32:17.070 --> 32:17.590]  It does.
[32:17.810 --> 32:21.170]  She got like a swoopy kind of... like a swoopy bang.
[32:22.070 --> 32:22.870]  This seems...
[32:22.870 --> 32:25.450]  He says, I want you to teach me tonight.
[32:26.370 --> 32:27.090]  I don't like that.
[32:27.170 --> 32:27.750]  I don't like it either.
[32:27.930 --> 32:28.110]  Yeah.
[32:28.350 --> 32:28.490]  Yeah.
[32:29.610 --> 32:30.330]  Prisoner exchange.
[32:33.710 --> 32:36.650]  Well, I have now seen...
[32:36.650 --> 32:38.490]  Now I know what Vampire Diaries is.
[32:38.590 --> 32:39.230]  Fucking useless.
[32:39.430 --> 32:39.730]  Okay.
[32:40.490 --> 32:41.810]  How do you feel about...
[32:41.810 --> 32:42.590]  Oh, here we go.
[32:42.590 --> 32:43.870]  I saw that and I went, yep.
[32:44.010 --> 32:44.330]  Boom.
[32:44.410 --> 32:45.950]  One of my favorite movies of all time.
[32:46.930 --> 32:49.670]  Liked it so much when it came out in the sixth grade, I bought the book.
[32:50.170 --> 32:50.350]  Wow.
[32:50.350 --> 32:51.310]  And read the book too.
[32:51.390 --> 32:52.350]  Harry and the Hendersons.
[32:52.430 --> 32:54.490]  Does the book have it where he's like yelling at him and stuff?
[32:54.490 --> 32:55.390]  It's like word for word.
[32:55.390 --> 32:56.330]  Yeah, that sounds right.
[32:57.110 --> 32:58.270]  It's just the script.
[32:58.550 --> 32:59.070]  I also...
[32:59.070 --> 32:59.810]  What pudding he said.
[33:00.050 --> 33:01.370]  I also haven't read it.
[33:01.390 --> 33:02.230]  I also haven't read it.
[33:02.230 --> 33:02.910]  It's very Dan Brown.
[33:03.230 --> 33:05.230]  I also haven't read it since I was in the sixth grade.
[33:06.050 --> 33:07.810]  We're just wild about Harry.
[33:08.130 --> 33:09.170]  This looks like bingo.
[33:09.170 --> 33:09.510]  Aren't we all?
[33:09.690 --> 33:10.150]  It does.
[33:10.250 --> 33:11.250]  This looks like bingo cards.
[33:11.530 --> 33:13.250]  A Topps picture card series.
[33:13.330 --> 33:13.990]  Harry and the Hendersons.
[33:14.070 --> 33:14.450]  That's pretty.
[33:14.450 --> 33:14.690]  Nice.
[33:14.730 --> 33:15.810]  That's the whole family portrait.
[33:15.910 --> 33:15.950]  Very nice.
[33:16.130 --> 33:16.350]  Yeah.
[33:16.830 --> 33:19.590]  Oh, there's young Ernie Henderson looking like a pimp.
[33:19.610 --> 33:20.910]  Oh my God.
[33:23.990 --> 33:26.770]  That's an 80s player right there.
[33:27.710 --> 33:28.830]  Harry and the Hendersons.
[33:28.990 --> 33:29.330]  That's a sticker.
[33:29.950 --> 33:30.550]  Oh, that's fun.
[33:30.770 --> 33:31.130]  Uh-oh.
[33:31.450 --> 33:32.750]  That's no way to treat an old friend.
[33:32.850 --> 33:34.530]  That's when Harry's freaked out by the deer on the wall.
[33:34.670 --> 33:35.190]  He can't believe it.
[33:35.190 --> 33:37.250]  He doesn't understand where the rest of it is.
[33:38.650 --> 33:40.650]  Don't look behind you, LeFleur.
[33:41.810 --> 33:42.130]  Okay.
[33:42.270 --> 33:42.930]  He's a bad guy.
[33:43.030 --> 33:43.170]  Yeah.
[33:43.730 --> 33:45.870]  Oh, in search of Dr. Wrightwood.
[33:45.990 --> 33:46.490]  Let me tell you something.
[33:46.570 --> 33:49.590]  I don't know where Harry and the Hendersons took place, but I want to live in that town.
[33:50.030 --> 33:50.830]  I mean, I assume it's...
[33:50.830 --> 33:50.890]  Wait.
[33:50.910 --> 33:51.470]  I don't know.
[33:51.470 --> 33:52.470]  It's like a gorgeous mountain town.
[33:52.690 --> 33:53.390]  Probably is.
[33:53.470 --> 33:54.630]  Maybe in Northern California.
[33:54.870 --> 33:55.290]  It's fucking gorgeous.
[33:55.290 --> 33:56.570]  Or it's Oregon or something, you know?
[33:56.690 --> 33:57.910]  There's George Henderson himself.
[33:57.990 --> 33:58.410]  John Lithgow.
[33:58.530 --> 33:59.110]  There he is.
[33:59.510 --> 34:00.150]  God bless him.
[34:00.990 --> 34:04.730]  He's the reason that the apes got smart in Planet of the Apes.
[34:04.990 --> 34:05.430]  That's right.
[34:05.590 --> 34:05.970]  He is.
[34:06.110 --> 34:06.410]  He is.
[34:06.570 --> 34:06.750]  Yeah.
[34:06.870 --> 34:07.590]  I forgot about that.
[34:08.490 --> 34:10.250]  He lives here with you.
[34:11.030 --> 34:15.230]  Fun fact about Planet of the Apes movies, the new ones, Millie and I are...
[34:15.230 --> 34:15.790]  It's our thing.
[34:16.610 --> 34:16.930]  Oh, yeah?
[34:16.970 --> 34:17.150]  Yeah.
[34:17.230 --> 34:19.270]  We go on opening day any time one comes out.
[34:19.350 --> 34:19.730]  Oh, that's fun.
[34:19.730 --> 34:20.210]  It's like...
[34:20.210 --> 34:22.130]  I don't know what it is, but we really connect.
[34:22.250 --> 34:22.630]  That's cool.
[34:22.750 --> 34:23.370]  Through those movies.
[34:23.570 --> 34:25.650]  I just realized I put all these cards on top of the cards that we were keeping.
[34:25.710 --> 34:26.770]  But it's okay.
[34:26.990 --> 34:27.570]  Here's bones.
[34:27.810 --> 34:30.090]  And then these go in your little stack over there.
[34:30.090 --> 34:30.670]  I'll put them over here.
[34:30.670 --> 34:30.850]  See?
[34:31.110 --> 34:32.010]  In the doo-doo pile.
[34:32.130 --> 34:32.350]  That's helpful.
[34:32.950 --> 34:33.950]  Let's, uh...
[34:33.950 --> 34:34.950]  Hey, remember this?
[34:35.290 --> 34:35.510]  Yeah.
[34:35.650 --> 34:36.730]  I'm not gonna open it again, but...
[34:36.730 --> 34:37.050]  That's good.
[34:37.310 --> 34:37.910]  That was crazy.
[34:38.010 --> 34:38.410]  That was crazy.
[34:38.610 --> 34:39.610]  June 23rd for the Gerplers.
[34:39.670 --> 34:41.690]  I didn't even know that that was gonna be here.
[34:41.770 --> 34:42.450]  I didn't either.
[34:42.650 --> 34:43.510]  I'd not seen it.
[34:43.690 --> 34:44.070]  That's crazy.
[34:44.210 --> 34:44.330]  Yeah.
[34:44.330 --> 34:44.390]  Yeah.
[34:44.470 --> 34:46.230]  I have a lot of people slacking me right now and going like,
[34:46.290 --> 34:46.770]  Do you wanna see it all?
[34:47.170 --> 34:47.990]  It's like, I'm busy.
[34:48.070 --> 34:48.510]  I'm doing this.
[34:48.890 --> 34:49.990]  I hate some slacks.
[34:51.310 --> 34:52.130]  Let's switch sports.
[34:52.270 --> 34:52.470]  Okay.
[34:53.090 --> 34:54.150]  Let's go for football.
[34:54.310 --> 34:54.930]  It's the offseason.
[34:55.010 --> 34:55.350]  Why not?
[34:56.230 --> 34:56.550]  What?
[34:56.870 --> 34:57.730]  You know what I hate about football?
[34:57.870 --> 34:58.210]  What's that?
[34:59.290 --> 34:59.870]  Not a lot.
[35:00.010 --> 35:00.510]  I love football.
[35:00.650 --> 35:01.570]  I love college football.
[35:01.730 --> 35:02.390]  I love pro football.
[35:02.430 --> 35:04.490]  I don't really follow a team in pro football.
[35:04.710 --> 35:06.010]  I just enjoy the sport in general.
[35:06.130 --> 35:06.210]  Yeah.
[35:06.250 --> 35:06.590]  Red zone.
[35:07.330 --> 35:07.650]  Uh...
[35:07.650 --> 35:08.570]  Red zone, exactly.
[35:08.730 --> 35:09.390]  I'm a huge red zone fan.
[35:10.110 --> 35:10.430]  Uh...
[35:10.430 --> 35:11.190]  What I do...
[35:11.190 --> 35:12.550]  One thing I do hate about football, though,
[35:12.550 --> 35:15.290]  is that football coverage never stops.
[35:15.750 --> 35:16.010]  Oh, yeah.
[35:16.390 --> 35:17.030]  SportsCenter is...
[35:17.650 --> 35:18.670]  I watch SportsCenter every day of my life.
[35:18.790 --> 35:20.510]  It is 80% football.
[35:20.550 --> 35:20.730]  Yep.
[35:21.430 --> 35:22.430]  365 days a year.
[35:22.590 --> 35:22.790]  Yeah.
[35:23.170 --> 35:23.570]  It's...
[35:23.570 --> 35:24.710]  It's hard to watch.
[35:24.890 --> 35:26.650]  It's like, I just wanna watch these highlights and stuff,
[35:26.690 --> 35:27.050]  and it's like,
[35:27.070 --> 35:28.430]  oh, I'd just get that from somewhere else, I guess.
[35:28.430 --> 35:28.770]  It's like, you're...
[35:28.770 --> 35:29.570]  I'm watching it there.
[35:29.750 --> 35:31.110]  You're not gonna cover...
[35:31.110 --> 35:33.190]  You're only gonna cover half of the NBA games...
[35:33.470 --> 35:35.770]  ...even though football season is over...
[35:35.850 --> 35:38.690]  ...because Lamar Jackson said something at a diner.
[35:38.810 --> 35:38.970]  Yeah.
[35:39.270 --> 35:39.930]  And it's like, okay.
[35:40.230 --> 35:42.530]  Like, are they covering what's happening in the NBA?
[35:42.530 --> 35:43.830]  Are they covering Las Vegas with the A's?
[35:44.890 --> 35:46.630]  And how they might, like...
[35:46.630 --> 35:47.870]  It sounds like they're headed there.
[35:48.630 --> 35:49.150]  It does.
[35:49.470 --> 35:50.230]  And they were...
[35:50.230 --> 35:51.390]  They hadn't signed any of the paperwork
[35:51.390 --> 35:52.530]  to get the stadium built,
[35:52.650 --> 35:55.910]  and now the owner is getting bent over a barrel.
[35:56.210 --> 35:58.950]  And it is fantastic to watch.
[35:59.050 --> 36:00.350]  You know what happens when you get bent over a barrel.
[36:00.430 --> 36:00.770]  What's that?
[36:00.890 --> 36:01.810]  They jam it in you.
[36:01.910 --> 36:02.730]  Oh, brother.
[36:02.870 --> 36:03.490]  It's not good.
[36:03.970 --> 36:04.530]  Brad Johnson.
[36:05.370 --> 36:06.210]  These are college?
[36:06.750 --> 36:07.090]  Or...
[36:07.090 --> 36:07.930]  These are NFL.
[36:08.210 --> 36:08.550]  Oh, okay.
[36:08.770 --> 36:09.910]  That's the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
[36:09.930 --> 36:11.490]  The M really threw me at the bottom.
[36:11.490 --> 36:12.270]  Saquon Barkley.
[36:12.430 --> 36:13.070]  They're mosaic cards.
[36:13.150 --> 36:13.730]  Fantastic player.
[36:13.970 --> 36:14.070]  Yeah.
[36:14.670 --> 36:15.510]  Mike Williams.
[36:15.750 --> 36:16.990]  Yeah, this is last year's mosaic.
[36:17.150 --> 36:18.090]  Jason Taylor.
[36:20.030 --> 36:23.670]  Boy, I have a lot of money invested in Zach Wilson rookie cards.
[36:23.810 --> 36:23.850]  Yeah.
[36:23.870 --> 36:24.250]  How's that going?
[36:24.530 --> 36:25.210]  Not well.
[36:25.350 --> 36:25.510]  Crazy.
[36:25.590 --> 36:28.330]  I really, really bet wrong on Zach Wilson.
[36:28.390 --> 36:28.650]  Yeah.
[36:28.690 --> 36:30.110]  Well, I mean, he's definitely going to be
[36:30.110 --> 36:32.130]  the starting quarterback for the Jets next year, right?
[36:32.670 --> 36:33.090]  Geoff?
[36:33.430 --> 36:33.850]  Right?
[36:34.310 --> 36:36.790]  Well, we'll see what happens to Grandpa Rogers.
[36:37.070 --> 36:38.190]  Whoa, that was crazy.
[36:38.350 --> 36:38.650]  That was crazy.
[36:38.650 --> 36:39.390]  I can't believe it was next.
[36:39.450 --> 36:40.190]  That was absolutely crazy.
[36:40.190 --> 36:42.350]  Did you see him show up and he looked like the guy from Creed?
[36:43.050 --> 36:49.790]  He had, like, old jeans on and, like, a white tank top and his hairs all flowed back.
[36:50.150 --> 36:51.710]  And he looked like he was there with the...
[36:52.390 --> 36:53.550]  It was pretty cool.
[36:53.870 --> 36:58.290]  His style evolution, let's call it.
[36:58.650 --> 37:00.310]  It's more than just style, too.
[37:00.690 --> 37:03.330]  Like, Shailene Woodley opened his eyes to a whole new world.
[37:03.350 --> 37:03.790]  Yeah, dude.
[37:04.310 --> 37:06.530]  Brother, when you start eating mud, hell yeah.
[37:06.670 --> 37:07.310]  Oh, my God.
[37:07.550 --> 37:08.330]  Chad Johnson.
[37:08.710 --> 37:09.150]  Ochocinco.
[37:09.770 --> 37:10.250]  Ochocinco.
[37:10.450 --> 37:11.690]  Rondell Moore.
[37:13.270 --> 37:14.230]  Javonte Williams.
[37:15.550 --> 37:16.610]  It's more fun if you say it like that.
[37:17.790 --> 37:18.750]  Desmond Ritter.
[37:20.250 --> 37:20.730]  Rookie.
[37:21.230 --> 37:21.370]  Nice.
[37:22.270 --> 37:26.850]  Cade Otten looking like a guy who wasn't designed to wear shorts.
[37:28.050 --> 37:30.130]  You know, like, some shorts aren't for everybody, right?
[37:30.290 --> 37:31.470]  He looks like a redshirt freshman.
[37:31.970 --> 37:32.390]  He does.
[37:32.610 --> 37:33.910]  He ain't playing.
[37:34.110 --> 37:34.870]  They call him redshort freshman.
[37:36.270 --> 37:37.230]  Sky Moore.
[37:37.230 --> 37:39.450]  Got the extra Y because he flies.
[37:40.170 --> 37:40.530]  Nice.
[37:41.710 --> 37:42.670]  Calvin Austin III.
[37:42.790 --> 37:44.530]  These are a pile of rookies I've never heard of.
[37:45.690 --> 37:46.610]  Ooh, Christian Watson.
[37:47.370 --> 37:47.730]  Green.
[37:47.890 --> 37:48.550]  Prism Parallel.
[37:48.570 --> 37:51.010]  Why do they do logos left, logos right?
[37:51.150 --> 37:51.970]  Is it AFC, NFC?
[37:53.370 --> 37:54.290]  Let me see what you're talking about.
[37:54.390 --> 37:54.550]  Oh.
[37:54.650 --> 37:54.870]  See that?
[37:55.870 --> 37:57.710]  Well, Steelers are...
[37:57.710 --> 37:58.710]  Those are AFC, right?
[37:58.850 --> 38:00.930]  No, that's AFC, so I don't know.
[38:00.970 --> 38:01.730]  That's a good question.
[38:01.830 --> 38:02.130]  I don't know.
[38:02.590 --> 38:02.770]  Weird.
[38:02.890 --> 38:03.470]  Do you know the answer?
[38:04.150 --> 38:04.750]  Please tell us.
[38:04.750 --> 38:07.270]  Oh, I thought you were looking at Cody.
[38:07.830 --> 38:09.070]  I don't think Cody knows.
[38:09.890 --> 38:10.570]  Fred Taylor.
[38:10.750 --> 38:11.950]  Orange, Prism Parallel.
[38:13.110 --> 38:13.870]  Eli Manning.
[38:14.150 --> 38:15.090]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[38:15.230 --> 38:16.110]  John Elway.
[38:16.670 --> 38:18.230]  It's a who's who of who no longer plays.
[38:18.270 --> 38:18.810]  Yeah, no kidding.
[38:19.110 --> 38:19.990]  Logan Hall.
[38:20.350 --> 38:23.190]  Also not looking like a guy who was meant to wear shorts.
[38:23.690 --> 38:24.430]  Oh, these are the best.
[38:24.490 --> 38:25.070]  Touchdown Masters.
[38:25.270 --> 38:25.390]  Okay.
[38:25.630 --> 38:26.650]  There's Justin Geofferson.
[38:26.990 --> 38:28.850]  You know, they got big heads.
[38:28.990 --> 38:29.670]  These are big head cards.
[38:29.830 --> 38:30.610]  Little body, big head.
[38:30.810 --> 38:31.070]  Okay.
[38:31.250 --> 38:32.970]  You know what Justin Geofferson did?
[38:33.130 --> 38:33.510]  What's that?
[38:33.510 --> 38:34.950]  Well, he's a really, really good receiver.
[38:35.050 --> 38:36.710]  But he also, he invented the gritty.
[38:37.270 --> 38:38.190]  Oh, is that the gritty guy?
[38:38.330 --> 38:39.190]  I think he invented the gritty.
[38:39.410 --> 38:42.170]  Yeah, I think he's the author, as it were.
[38:42.310 --> 38:44.730]  And Tyreek Hill, Thunder Lane.
[38:44.950 --> 38:45.290]  That's pretty cool.
[38:45.510 --> 38:49.790]  Boy, the Dolphins had a lot of promise until Concussion City, didn't they?
[38:49.910 --> 38:50.170]  Yep, yep.
[38:50.230 --> 38:55.670]  You ever watch the Manning cast thing for like Monday Night Football or whatever?
[38:55.790 --> 38:57.630]  I haven't yet, but I hear it's fantastic.
[38:57.810 --> 38:59.030]  It's, here's the thing.
[38:59.550 --> 39:00.190]  It's not.
[39:00.530 --> 39:00.790]  Oh.
[39:00.790 --> 39:04.070]  But it's people discovering what Twitch is.
[39:05.530 --> 39:06.730]  Okay, I got you.
[39:06.890 --> 39:12.030]  They just went, why come not put people on top talking whole time?
[39:12.790 --> 39:14.010]  Do it like video game?
[39:14.390 --> 39:15.570]  And then they did.
[39:15.690 --> 39:18.170]  And it's like the thing that everyone watches.
[39:18.310 --> 39:19.970]  And you go, this isn't special.
[39:20.270 --> 39:21.010]  This is Twitch.
[39:21.870 --> 39:23.090]  You didn't invent anything.
[39:23.370 --> 39:23.690]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[39:23.790 --> 39:24.690]  It's pretty cool.
[39:24.770 --> 39:25.930]  They're like 10 years too late too.
[39:25.950 --> 39:26.430]  It's fantastic.
[39:26.730 --> 39:27.990]  Let's open up some 1990 tops.
[39:28.150 --> 39:28.370]  Okay.
[39:28.610 --> 39:29.410]  Maybe we'll get...
[39:29.410 --> 39:29.970]  Can we Zim in?
[39:30.770 --> 39:32.990]  Let me look at, I have to see the cover to see if he's in.
[39:34.190 --> 39:35.130]  Yeah, there's a Zim in this.
[39:35.130 --> 39:35.310]  Okay.
[39:35.410 --> 39:35.530]  Okay.
[39:36.290 --> 39:37.510]  Well, I mean, I don't know if it's in this pack.
[39:37.510 --> 39:37.750]  Right, right, right.
[39:37.950 --> 39:38.790]  There's a Zim in this.
[39:39.490 --> 39:40.170]  Storm Davis.
[39:40.330 --> 39:40.530]  Boom.
[39:40.870 --> 39:41.590]  Ed Nunes.
[39:42.950 --> 39:43.630]  Tom Niedenfuehr.
[39:46.130 --> 39:46.810]  Rick Mueller.
[39:47.070 --> 39:47.230]  Okay.
[39:48.470 --> 39:49.150]  Terry Steinbach.
[39:49.390 --> 39:51.370]  Didn't he win rookie of the year?
[39:52.870 --> 39:53.550]  I can't remember.
[39:53.750 --> 39:56.030]  He does, I mean, just looking at him, no.
[39:57.490 --> 39:58.170]  Brian Holman.
[39:59.070 --> 40:00.810]  Tim Tufel, I guess.
[40:01.610 --> 40:02.050]  Tafel.
[40:02.970 --> 40:04.650]  That's a checklist.
[40:04.710 --> 40:05.090]  Checklist.
[40:05.350 --> 40:07.530]  I love that they would split them up, obviously, because there's too many cards.
[40:08.050 --> 40:10.810]  You'd have to get six checklists to understand what was in the phone.
[40:10.810 --> 40:11.970]  To understand.
[40:12.290 --> 40:12.930]  I'm lost.
[40:13.690 --> 40:14.650]  Jody Davis.
[40:14.870 --> 40:15.150]  Okay.
[40:16.010 --> 40:16.930]  Randy Kramer.
[40:17.830 --> 40:18.670]  Fred Tolliver.
[40:19.490 --> 40:20.490]  Mike Davis.
[40:20.810 --> 40:21.770]  Was it Tolliver from the Padres?
[40:21.850 --> 40:22.250]  It was.
[40:23.830 --> 40:24.170]  Yes.
[40:24.250 --> 40:24.390]  Yep.
[40:24.570 --> 40:25.030]  Yes, yes.
[40:25.430 --> 40:26.930]  Joe Orsolak.
[40:29.270 --> 40:29.910]  Geoff Brantley.
[40:30.670 --> 40:31.310]  Gary Gaetti.
[40:31.970 --> 40:33.470]  And Rolando Rooms.
[40:33.690 --> 40:33.910]  Nice.
[40:34.650 --> 40:34.970]  Nothing.
[40:35.210 --> 40:35.910]  All cards.
[40:36.690 --> 40:37.010]  Okay.
[40:37.810 --> 40:39.110]  I want to open up something special.
[40:39.310 --> 40:39.510]  Okay.
[40:39.630 --> 40:40.290]  Something specific.
[40:40.710 --> 40:45.890]  So, for the break shows I've been doing all week, I have been opening up these Superstars of Music cards.
[40:45.930 --> 40:46.450]  Oh, that's fun.
[40:47.030 --> 40:49.490]  And I had an idea last night when I was thinking about it.
[40:49.730 --> 40:50.930]  I'm going to open up these and we're going to talk about it.
[40:50.930 --> 40:52.530]  I can't do it today because I didn't bring enough with me.
[40:52.670 --> 40:52.850]  Okay.
[40:52.870 --> 40:53.770]  But I have a ton more at home.
[40:54.870 --> 40:58.310]  I think that the next pack of these... actually, we can do it with this pack.
[40:58.450 --> 40:58.590]  Okay.
[40:59.310 --> 41:02.150]  And then it will require some audience effort.
[41:02.330 --> 41:06.890]  But what if we made a mixtape with one song from every band on there?
[41:06.930 --> 41:08.570]  You're so smart.
[41:08.890 --> 41:10.090]  That's such a good idea.
[41:10.250 --> 41:10.570]  Right?
[41:10.950 --> 41:16.750]  Like, we can do an actual, like, tape thing or whatever, but I think you make, like, a Spotify playlist thing.
[41:16.790 --> 41:17.690]  Yeah, that's just like...
[41:17.690 --> 41:20.610]  And it's like, pick one song from, for example...
[41:20.610 --> 41:21.190]  Digital Underground.
[41:21.190 --> 41:21.650]  Digital Underground.
[41:21.770 --> 41:22.750]  There was one song to pick.
[41:22.750 --> 41:23.250]  There you go.
[41:23.350 --> 41:23.490]  Yep.
[41:25.350 --> 41:28.990]  Does everybody remember Adam Sky at AMSKY?
[41:29.430 --> 41:30.490]  I certainly don't.
[41:30.870 --> 41:31.010]  Nope.
[41:31.950 --> 41:32.670]  Maxi Priest.
[41:32.850 --> 41:34.490]  How long has this song Maxi Priest had?
[41:34.770 --> 41:37.030]  This is... I really like this idea.
[41:37.850 --> 41:38.470]  Now, here's the thing.
[41:38.550 --> 41:41.450]  I think you have to get, like, how many songs do you want this to be?
[41:41.830 --> 41:42.870]  Because you're saying, like...
[41:42.870 --> 41:43.330]  Just one for each card.
[41:43.390 --> 41:44.750]  Okay, so you're saying one for everyone.
[41:45.190 --> 41:45.690]  I think so.
[41:45.810 --> 41:50.270]  I thought we were going to do, like, maybe, like, we each pick, like, eight.
[41:50.390 --> 41:51.010]  We can do that too.
[41:51.010 --> 41:54.030]  We put them all together, and then it's a random sort of drawing.
[41:54.290 --> 41:57.550]  And then we each have a mixtape from the other person.
[41:57.930 --> 42:00.610]  And then, so, it's like, there's five playlists.
[42:01.050 --> 42:01.410]  Yeah.
[42:01.710 --> 42:05.410]  And then it's, you know, like, it's you, Gavin, Andrew, me, and Nick.
[42:05.470 --> 42:07.530]  We each get eight songs or whatever.
[42:08.270 --> 42:11.930]  Randomly select, like, eight cards, and then we each do, like, a little playlist.
[42:12.170 --> 42:14.230]  And then we let the audience vote on who's the best playlist.
[42:14.270 --> 42:18.290]  Yeah, because we don't get to pick the card, but we're going to pick the best song from the person.
[42:18.470 --> 42:19.110]  That's what we're doing.
[42:19.150 --> 42:19.710]  I think that's fun.
[42:19.710 --> 42:20.490]  That's a great idea.
[42:20.490 --> 42:22.410]  Because it's not really, like, a draft, but it's a draft.
[42:22.590 --> 42:24.230]  See, this is why it's important to be together.
[42:24.270 --> 42:24.430]  Yeah.
[42:24.610 --> 42:25.050]  In person.
[42:25.230 --> 42:25.930]  I had an idea.
[42:25.990 --> 42:26.730]  I had a good idea.
[42:26.910 --> 42:28.350]  You just made it a great idea.
[42:28.370 --> 42:29.070]  I think it's a lot of fun.
[42:29.270 --> 42:30.610]  And that wouldn't have happened if we weren't here.
[42:30.770 --> 42:32.290]  I hope I get this next one.
[42:32.450 --> 42:34.990]  Blues Traveler, for the song I would pick, is Hook.
[42:35.490 --> 42:36.090]  Oh, okay.
[42:36.150 --> 42:37.870]  You don't want to get somebody to run around?
[42:37.870 --> 42:37.950]  Nope.
[42:37.950 --> 42:39.810]  No, I think Hook's a better song.
[42:40.530 --> 42:41.170]  Jodie Watley.
[42:42.210 --> 42:44.370]  Oh, everybody loves Nelson.
[42:44.450 --> 42:44.690]  Oh!
[42:45.950 --> 42:47.130]  They were the best.
[42:47.370 --> 42:48.050]  That's two of them.
[42:48.590 --> 42:50.150]  There's the Bullet Boys.
[42:50.650 --> 42:54.530]  That's a cool-ass name for a band that probably was not.
[42:55.550 --> 42:57.370]  Dude, Bullet Boys, sick.
[42:57.750 --> 42:58.270]  Bonham.
[42:58.530 --> 42:59.150]  Oh, nice.
[43:00.090 --> 43:02.430]  For all you metalheads, here's Sanctuary.
[43:02.590 --> 43:02.890]  Nice.
[43:03.130 --> 43:06.790]  And I cannot fucking believe that this gets a card.
[43:06.890 --> 43:07.030]  Okay.
[43:08.770 --> 43:10.110]  It's the Cro-Mags.
[43:10.510 --> 43:11.010]  Whoa!
[43:11.030 --> 43:11.730]  One of the hardest...
[43:11.730 --> 43:12.390]  Are you serious?
[43:12.590 --> 43:13.830]  ...hardest hardcore bands of all time.
[43:13.890 --> 43:14.790]  That's Harley Flanagan.
[43:14.850 --> 43:15.590]  What the fuck?
[43:15.590 --> 43:17.510]  Sometimes lead singer of the Cro-Mags.
[43:17.550 --> 43:19.390]  They were always, like, fighting with each other.
[43:19.670 --> 43:23.870]  He would go out and have his own band called Harley and the Cro-Mags that wasn't Cro-Mags.
[43:24.430 --> 43:26.130]  I one time...
[43:26.130 --> 43:27.410]  I've told this story before.
[43:27.550 --> 43:29.670]  I won't bore you with it now.
[43:29.730 --> 43:35.850]  But I one time went to an all-out war Cro-Mag show in Austin that ended in a riot.
[43:36.230 --> 43:38.090]  And I saw somebody kick...
[43:38.090 --> 43:41.810]  I saw... first off, he was big into MMA and, like, he... or jiu-jitsu.
[43:42.150 --> 43:48.510]  And, like, in the middle of this, like, 40 fucking people, somebody came and he was fighting with them.
[43:48.590 --> 43:49.530]  And he just, like...
[43:49.850 --> 43:51.630]  And they were on the ground, like, in a submission hole.
[43:52.150 --> 43:54.230]  And I was like, holy shit, that's the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[43:54.250 --> 43:56.130]  And I thought, like, wow, that jiu-jitsu really works.
[43:56.450 --> 43:57.270]  Here's where it doesn't work.
[43:57.670 --> 44:00.010]  Another guy saw that and walked over and just kicked him as hard as he could in the face.
[44:00.930 --> 44:01.570]  Harley gets up.
[44:01.610 --> 44:02.790]  He's, like, fucking stumbling around.
[44:03.050 --> 44:04.250]  He walks over to the building.
[44:04.710 --> 44:05.790]  And I shit you not.
[44:05.790 --> 44:14.110]  He takes a piece of trim and rips it off the building, like, two by six or something.
[44:14.350 --> 44:15.110]  Covered in nails.
[44:15.250 --> 44:16.390]  And just starts swinging it.
[44:16.830 --> 44:19.670]  And then the cops showed up and started macing everybody.
[44:20.090 --> 44:21.550]  And I got the fuck out of there.
[44:21.750 --> 44:22.010]  Oh, my God.
[44:22.190 --> 44:23.030]  They were keeping that card.
[44:23.230 --> 44:25.110]  Why is there a Cro-Mags card in this thing?
[44:25.150 --> 44:25.710]  I don't know, dude.
[44:25.770 --> 44:27.810]  But that brought back a hell of a core memory.
[44:27.910 --> 44:28.590]  That rules.
[44:28.950 --> 44:29.170]  Yeah.
[44:29.290 --> 44:30.050]  Oh, my God.
[44:30.150 --> 44:31.090]  We gotta remember to do that.
[44:31.370 --> 44:32.210]  We gotta remember to do that.
[44:32.270 --> 44:32.970]  So that's what we're gonna do.
[44:33.030 --> 44:34.950]  We're gonna do the Superstars of Music playlist.
[44:34.950 --> 44:35.430]  That's awesome.
[44:35.590 --> 44:38.070]  I think randomly selecting is, like, a lot of fun.
[44:38.290 --> 44:38.690]  I totally agree.
[44:38.690 --> 44:39.490]  Do we have to do this?
[44:39.490 --> 44:41.710]  We got 12 minutes left, so we're gonna do Eric's favorite.
[44:41.870 --> 44:45.070]  We're gonna open up Garbage Pail Kids, Chrome.
[44:45.310 --> 44:46.890]  I genuinely hate these cards.
[44:46.990 --> 44:47.890]  I paid $10 for this.
[44:47.890 --> 44:49.490]  These are disgusting to look at.
[44:49.610 --> 44:51.990]  This is, like, the 90s.
[44:52.010 --> 44:53.510]  There's, like, a lot of, like, gross-out humor.
[44:53.790 --> 44:55.510]  It sucks, and I hate it.
[44:56.070 --> 44:56.430]  It's...
[44:56.430 --> 44:57.650]  I hate this shit.
[44:57.710 --> 45:01.270]  Well, if you hate Garbage Pail Kids, you're gonna love Garbage Pail Kids.
[45:02.790 --> 45:04.550]  Here's Liberty Libby.
[45:05.010 --> 45:07.470]  She's got a bag of trash that's breaking.
[45:08.390 --> 45:09.930]  Here's Fishy Phyllis.
[45:10.030 --> 45:10.790]  We gotta show the cards.
[45:12.390 --> 45:12.830]  Are we not showing the cards?
[45:12.830 --> 45:14.510]  Cut. Cut to the overhead camera.
[45:14.790 --> 45:15.130]  Here it comes.
[45:15.370 --> 45:16.330]  And here we go.
[45:16.590 --> 45:17.510]  And here it comes.
[45:17.730 --> 45:18.390]  And here we go.
[45:18.450 --> 45:19.490]  And there we go.
[45:19.650 --> 45:20.430]  And here it is.
[45:20.530 --> 45:22.030]  And now it is 96.
[45:22.310 --> 45:24.130]  And now's the time to cut to cam.
[45:24.330 --> 45:25.110]  And show it up.
[45:25.210 --> 45:26.130]  And here it goes.
[45:27.270 --> 45:28.150]  Here it comes.
[45:28.290 --> 45:28.810]  And overhead.
[45:29.030 --> 45:29.450]  There it is.
[45:29.450 --> 45:29.730]  Yeah!
[45:30.470 --> 45:32.410]  And here's Fishy Phyllis.
[45:33.750 --> 45:36.510]  And here's Mirror Imogene.
[45:37.230 --> 45:38.190]  Get it? Mirror Imogene?
[45:39.570 --> 45:40.050]  Pendlin.
[45:42.110 --> 45:43.070]  Dwight Byte.
[45:43.650 --> 45:44.210]  These suck.
[45:44.510 --> 45:45.230]  These are great.
[45:45.490 --> 45:45.970]  Bullseye.
[45:45.970 --> 45:47.970]  I was wrong. We shouldn't have cut to these. These suck.
[45:48.850 --> 45:50.450]  Oh, this is Silver Parallel.
[45:51.150 --> 45:52.110]  Ophelia Ornament.
[45:52.670 --> 45:54.970]  My favorite part is when we realize that there's two names for every card.
[45:54.970 --> 45:56.870]  Yeah, that was...
[45:56.870 --> 45:58.570]  Here's Terminator 2 Tootie.
[45:59.190 --> 45:59.990]  T2 Tootie.
[46:00.070 --> 46:00.670]  T2 Tootie.
[46:00.750 --> 46:01.370]  T2 Tootie.
[46:01.830 --> 46:02.570]  Adam Byrne.
[46:03.410 --> 46:03.890]  Cool.
[46:04.410 --> 46:04.890]  Cool.
[46:04.970 --> 46:05.330]  Pretty cool.
[46:05.390 --> 46:06.710]  Here's Babbling Brooke.
[46:06.890 --> 46:09.470]  She's eating her peanut butter and jelly and talking on the phone.
[46:09.930 --> 46:11.190]  Foul Rowl.
[46:13.050 --> 46:14.010]  And then...
[46:14.010 --> 46:14.850]  Grim Jim.
[46:16.190 --> 46:21.330]  Maybe you had to be born in 1975 and 10 years old in 1985 to truly appreciate the garbage...
[46:21.330 --> 46:22.650]  Yeah, I think...
[46:22.650 --> 46:23.390]  But boy, do I.
[46:23.490 --> 46:23.910]  You hate it.
[46:24.870 --> 46:26.810]  I hate them. They're gross. I'm mad.
[46:27.070 --> 46:27.370]  Yeah.
[46:27.370 --> 46:28.490]  Oh, you kept one.
[46:28.570 --> 46:29.670]  I'm keeping the Silver Parallel.
[46:29.690 --> 46:30.230]  Cool, man.
[46:30.510 --> 46:30.930]  Value there, man.
[46:31.510 --> 46:33.310]  Tell you what, I'm having fun with the non-sports stuff.
[46:33.470 --> 46:35.230]  Let's try another American...
[46:35.750 --> 46:36.150]  Americana.
[46:36.470 --> 46:38.870]  See if we can get lucky with that Jackie Chan...
[46:38.870 --> 46:39.530]  Yeah, let's do it.
[46:40.310 --> 46:41.110]  ...or Relic.
[46:41.250 --> 46:41.450]  Yeah.
[46:42.530 --> 46:43.310]  Miss Americana.
[46:43.770 --> 46:46.150]  Oh, I already tell we got some bangers in here.
[46:46.850 --> 46:48.250]  Here's... I believe he's dead.
[46:49.010 --> 46:50.530]  Mickey Dolenz of the Monkeys.
[46:50.810 --> 46:52.010]  Is Mickey Dolenz dead?
[46:52.030 --> 46:53.890]  I think everybody is dead.
[46:53.890 --> 46:54.290]  Oh, no.
[46:54.290 --> 46:55.370]  Except for...
[46:55.370 --> 46:57.010]  Mike Nesmith just died not too long ago.
[46:57.050 --> 46:57.150]  Oh, no.
[46:57.370 --> 46:58.370]  I want to say like...
[46:58.950 --> 47:00.250]  Hey, hey, we're the...
[47:00.250 --> 47:02.210]  Peter Tork is still alive.
[47:02.530 --> 47:03.290]  Is Mickey Dolenz dead?
[47:04.250 --> 47:04.630]  He's not dead?
[47:04.670 --> 47:04.930]  Yeah!
[47:05.390 --> 47:06.490]  Mickey Dolenz lives!
[47:07.810 --> 47:09.210]  Pay no attention to the reports.
[47:09.370 --> 47:10.750]  Mickey Dolenz is still alive.
[47:11.010 --> 47:12.030]  Hey, hey, we're the Monkeys.
[47:12.130 --> 47:12.770]  He's 78.
[47:13.070 --> 47:13.990]  Diane Farr.
[47:14.670 --> 47:15.370]  Diane Near.
[47:16.010 --> 47:16.270]  Oh.
[47:16.530 --> 47:17.110]  Oh, we got...
[47:17.110 --> 47:19.930]  If anybody wants to trade, we got doubles of John Cusack.
[47:19.950 --> 47:20.690]  We got...
[47:20.690 --> 47:21.550]  And...
[47:21.550 --> 47:22.130]  No!
[47:22.810 --> 47:23.110]  Danny again.
[47:23.210 --> 47:23.630]  Come on.
[47:23.630 --> 47:23.730]  Danny again.
[47:23.790 --> 47:26.530]  But this time we end it strong with Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
[47:28.650 --> 47:34.470]  Probably, I think, Julia and Ted Danson, probably the two greatest careers in television of
[47:34.470 --> 47:34.750]  all time.
[47:34.790 --> 47:35.390]  Yeah, I think...
[47:35.390 --> 47:35.650]  At least in my life.
[47:35.730 --> 47:35.870]  Yeah.
[47:36.330 --> 47:38.270]  I mean like...
[47:38.270 --> 47:40.930]  Veep, really incredible show that I cannot stomach.
[47:41.210 --> 47:41.570]  Oh, really?
[47:41.690 --> 47:42.430]  Oh, I love it.
[47:42.490 --> 47:42.710]  Love it.
[47:42.710 --> 47:43.950]  It's like my wife's favorite show.
[47:44.110 --> 47:45.550]  Just as Emily's favorite show, too.
[47:46.390 --> 47:48.130]  She had the whole run of Seinfeld, obviously.
[47:48.250 --> 47:48.770]  They all did, right?
[47:48.930 --> 47:49.810]  But then she had...
[47:49.810 --> 47:50.310]  People don't remember this.
[47:50.510 --> 47:52.030]  She had The New Adventures of Old Christine.
[47:52.030 --> 47:52.310]  The New Adventures of Old Christine, yep.
[47:52.370 --> 47:53.870]  Which was a very successful show.
[47:53.890 --> 47:54.510]  The first...
[47:54.510 --> 47:54.910]  Shekfel.
[47:55.150 --> 47:56.130]  Six or seven seasons.
[47:56.390 --> 47:57.230]  Yeah, it was on for like a long time.
[47:57.470 --> 47:59.530]  And then Veep, which is like...
[48:00.290 --> 48:00.670]  Everybody's...
[48:00.670 --> 48:01.470]  Everybody loves.
[48:01.490 --> 48:01.590]  Yeah.
[48:01.890 --> 48:02.650]  Everyone was in it.
[48:02.710 --> 48:03.830]  It is so...
[48:03.830 --> 48:07.450]  Just people losing, and I can't just watch people lose the whole time.
[48:07.810 --> 48:08.010]  Ugh.
[48:08.130 --> 48:08.310]  Yeah.
[48:08.550 --> 48:08.890]  Ugh.
[48:09.570 --> 48:09.950]  Let's...
[48:09.950 --> 48:10.450]  Aww.
[48:11.070 --> 48:11.830]  It's so little.
[48:13.450 --> 48:14.730]  I've been holding on to this one for a while.
[48:14.790 --> 48:16.790]  I bought this at a garage sale.
[48:16.890 --> 48:17.010]  Yeah.
[48:18.170 --> 48:20.510]  FLIR 9394 Vintage Basketball Cards.
[48:20.510 --> 48:21.510]  Let's see.
[48:22.090 --> 48:23.250]  I don't even know what these look like.
[48:23.330 --> 48:23.410]  Cool.
[48:23.410 --> 48:24.190]  Let's see what's in here.
[48:25.270 --> 48:26.590]  What if we got a basketball zim?
[48:27.090 --> 48:27.950]  That would be amazing.
[48:28.830 --> 48:29.770]  What's with this fly?
[48:30.230 --> 48:30.630]  I don't know.
[48:30.690 --> 48:31.150]  It loves us.
[48:31.290 --> 48:31.690]  It's a...
[48:31.690 --> 48:32.390]  It probably collects.
[48:32.870 --> 48:33.230]  Oh.
[48:33.790 --> 48:35.010]  He's in it for the rush, man.
[48:35.070 --> 48:36.630]  These are fucking stuck together.
[48:36.870 --> 48:37.190]  Yeah, why?
[48:37.830 --> 48:40.910]  They really didn't anticipate when they made these that people wouldn't open them for 30
[48:40.910 --> 48:41.150]  years.
[48:41.550 --> 48:42.150]  Holy shit.
[48:42.870 --> 48:43.370]  What's that?
[48:43.430 --> 48:43.850]  Shaquille O'Neal.
[48:44.170 --> 48:45.770]  Hey, he's on the ground right now.
[48:46.130 --> 48:46.510]  Holy shit.
[48:46.630 --> 48:46.810]  Pretty cool.
[48:47.250 --> 48:47.810]  Well, it's a morning.
[48:48.090 --> 48:48.550]  Oh, nice.
[48:48.550 --> 48:49.550]  Oh, that's cool.
[48:49.710 --> 48:50.750]  That art is fucking sick.
[48:50.830 --> 48:51.650]  It is fucking sick, right?
[48:51.670 --> 48:51.990]  That's awesome.
[48:52.270 --> 48:53.330]  I like that a lot.
[48:53.630 --> 48:54.310]  Shaq and Alonzo.
[48:54.510 --> 48:54.670]  Nice.
[48:54.810 --> 48:55.730]  Here's Patrick Ewing.
[48:55.930 --> 48:56.450]  It is Patrick Ewing.
[48:57.350 --> 48:58.150]  Jerome Kersey.
[48:59.390 --> 49:01.130]  NBA coach Scott Brooks.
[49:01.330 --> 49:01.610]  Mm-hmm.
[49:02.330 --> 49:03.130]  Rex Chapman.
[49:04.650 --> 49:05.450]  Brad Doherty.
[49:05.670 --> 49:06.590]  Oh, is that an old Bullets jersey?
[49:07.470 --> 49:08.230]  Uh, yes.
[49:08.410 --> 49:09.270]  This is his Washington Bullets jersey.
[49:09.410 --> 49:10.370]  Were they the Bullets at that time?
[49:10.510 --> 49:10.650]  Mm-hmm.
[49:11.770 --> 49:12.130]  Really?
[49:12.370 --> 49:12.610]  Mm-hmm.
[49:13.370 --> 49:14.090]  When were they...
[49:14.090 --> 49:15.170]  When did they become Wizards?
[49:15.190 --> 49:17.170]  When Jordan, like, took over.
[49:17.610 --> 49:17.870]  Wow.
[49:17.870 --> 49:18.150]  Really?
[49:18.270 --> 49:18.410]  Right around that time.
[49:18.410 --> 49:20.290]  Like, 95?
[49:21.410 --> 49:21.730]  96?
[49:22.010 --> 49:22.330]  Somewhere in there?
[49:22.910 --> 49:23.090]  Huh.
[49:23.090 --> 49:23.790]  Mark Eaton.
[49:24.490 --> 49:25.850]  He's eaten those rebounds.
[49:25.990 --> 49:26.090]  Yeah.
[49:26.390 --> 49:26.630]  He was a big dude.
[49:26.630 --> 49:29.210]  Why were the Jazz Lakers colors?
[49:32.790 --> 49:35.990]  Uh, probably because they were New Orleans at the time.
[49:36.010 --> 49:36.270]  Mm.
[49:36.450 --> 49:37.650]  And that's, like, Mardi Gras colors.
[49:38.030 --> 49:38.490]  Oh, OK.
[49:38.770 --> 49:38.990]  Right?
[49:39.070 --> 49:40.570]  But they were New Orleans before they moved to Utah.
[49:40.730 --> 49:41.430]  Yeah, I remember.
[49:41.570 --> 49:41.830]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:41.850 --> 49:43.350]  It made no sense to be Utah Jazz.
[49:43.430 --> 49:43.590]  Nope.
[49:43.730 --> 49:44.510]  And they still are.
[49:44.610 --> 49:45.190]  Jon Paxson.
[49:45.310 --> 49:45.650]  Mm-hmm.
[49:45.650 --> 49:46.910]  Tom Gugliotta.
[49:47.190 --> 49:47.510]  Nice.
[49:47.670 --> 49:48.550]  Another Washington Bullet.
[49:48.690 --> 49:48.970]  Very cool.
[49:49.350 --> 49:49.990]  Percy Hawkins.
[49:50.470 --> 49:51.690]  Todd Day.
[49:52.870 --> 49:53.470]  Marcus.
[49:54.070 --> 49:55.310]  Statue of Liberty.
[49:57.570 --> 49:58.170]  Ooh.
[49:58.570 --> 49:59.610]  Talk about a letdown.
[49:59.730 --> 50:00.590]  Christian Leitner.
[50:02.090 --> 50:03.130]  That, big time.
[50:03.210 --> 50:04.010]  Sherman Douglas.
[50:04.290 --> 50:04.410]  Mm-hmm.
[50:04.730 --> 50:05.630]  Save all Celtics.
[50:06.750 --> 50:08.930]  Uh, Eddie Johnson.
[50:09.130 --> 50:10.310]  I liked Eddie Johnson a lot.
[50:10.830 --> 50:12.590]  I love those Sonics jerseys, man.
[50:12.730 --> 50:13.430]  Those are so cool.
[50:13.490 --> 50:14.050]  Anthony Peeler.
[50:14.950 --> 50:15.630]  Paul Gugliotta.
[50:15.630 --> 50:16.390]  Graham.
[50:16.690 --> 50:17.690]  What does Emily want?
[50:17.830 --> 50:18.770]  She knows we're doing this.
[50:18.990 --> 50:20.510]  What does Emily want?
[50:22.550 --> 50:22.950]  Okay.
[50:23.390 --> 50:23.670]  What do you want?
[50:23.910 --> 50:24.730]  What do you want?
[50:26.050 --> 50:27.210]  NBA basketball checklist.
[50:27.370 --> 50:27.690]  Oh, that's good.
[50:27.730 --> 50:28.510]  Otherwise you'd be lost.
[50:28.810 --> 50:29.130]  Ooh.
[50:29.790 --> 50:30.590]  Ronnie Cycli.
[50:31.530 --> 50:32.330]  Cliff Robinson.
[50:32.790 --> 50:35.990]  Cliff Robinson went on to appear in a season of Survivor.
[50:36.390 --> 50:36.890]  Oh, that's crazy.
[50:37.110 --> 50:37.530]  Did pretty well.
[50:37.650 --> 50:37.950]  Did pretty well.
[50:37.950 --> 50:39.790]  Did you see the Funhaus video that went out yesterday?
[50:39.930 --> 50:40.550]  Oh, with Ozzie?
[50:40.630 --> 50:41.330]  Isn't that crazy?
[50:41.470 --> 50:42.190]  That is insane.
[50:42.350 --> 50:43.130]  How did they work that out?
[50:43.230 --> 50:44.930]  Ryan's like a big Survivor guy, I think.
[50:45.130 --> 50:47.870]  Oh, he probably reached out and he's like, do you want to be in videos?
[50:48.010 --> 50:49.170]  And the guy probably went, I'm in L.A.
[50:49.410 --> 50:50.490]  I'm sure that's all it was.
[50:50.590 --> 50:51.030]  That's very cool.
[50:51.590 --> 50:53.170]  Like, I thought that was so great.
[50:53.350 --> 50:56.950]  And him talking about stuff that he snuck onto like the island and everything was like...
[50:56.950 --> 50:57.430]  That's insane.
[50:57.570 --> 50:58.090]  So cool.
[50:58.610 --> 50:59.490]  Big John Williams.
[51:00.710 --> 51:01.510]  Detlef Schrenth.
[51:01.850 --> 51:02.250]  Nice.
[51:02.430 --> 51:03.270]  I always liked Detlef.
[51:03.370 --> 51:03.490]  Yeah.
[51:04.810 --> 51:05.610]  Doug Smith.
[51:07.550 --> 51:08.350]  Chris Dudley.
[51:08.830 --> 51:09.210]  Ooh.
[51:09.650 --> 51:10.510]  The Worm.
[51:10.630 --> 51:11.450]  Dennis Rodman.
[51:12.870 --> 51:13.670]  Gary Grant.
[51:14.870 --> 51:16.090]  And Mike Uzzolino.
[51:16.490 --> 51:17.550]  That was a fun pack.
[51:17.670 --> 51:17.770]  Yep.
[51:17.890 --> 51:19.610]  That was a legitimately fun pack.
[51:19.710 --> 51:21.790]  All right, we're down to five minutes.
[51:21.910 --> 51:22.890]  Okay, so what are we doing?
[51:23.170 --> 51:23.570]  Five minutes.
[51:23.590 --> 51:25.150]  Is there a big pack that you wanted to do?
[51:25.150 --> 51:25.710]  You've been waiting?
[51:26.010 --> 51:28.610]  Yeah, I want to open some current NBA prism.
[51:29.030 --> 51:29.530]  Okay, let's do it.
[51:29.610 --> 51:31.190]  It's as good as it gets in retail prism.
[51:31.250 --> 51:33.810]  Guys, it's our last five minutes and then we can leave.
[51:35.830 --> 51:37.470]  I told you exactly what this was.
[51:38.890 --> 51:40.570]  I told you exactly what this was going to be.
[51:40.670 --> 51:41.010]  He did.
[51:41.090 --> 51:41.630]  I heard him say it.
[51:41.630 --> 51:42.630]  Six packs.
[51:43.150 --> 51:44.930]  This is probably the last six packs that we open.
[51:45.010 --> 51:45.230]  Okay.
[51:45.710 --> 51:46.990]  Thank you guys for watching.
[51:47.110 --> 51:49.130]  Thank you for buying all the vinyls.
[51:49.250 --> 51:49.730]  Buy the vinyls.
[51:49.790 --> 51:50.450]  The ones in the back.
[51:50.530 --> 51:51.270]  You're like, oh, can you sell those?
[51:51.310 --> 51:51.850]  Those are ours.
[51:52.470 --> 51:54.470]  Just so you know, this is for us who made it.
[51:54.850 --> 51:55.610]  So, hit me up.
[51:57.350 --> 51:58.070]  Don't hit him up.
[51:58.630 --> 51:59.310]  I'm not going to say it.
[51:59.350 --> 52:00.570]  Hey, June 23rd.
[52:00.830 --> 52:01.190]  Gerplers.
[52:02.710 --> 52:03.790]  500 of each color.
[52:04.130 --> 52:04.970]  You don't get a pick.
[52:05.350 --> 52:05.650]  Random.
[52:06.450 --> 52:09.870]  Plus 10 Golden Gerps and one of the Golden Gerps is signed.
[52:10.150 --> 52:10.570]  That's true.
[52:11.110 --> 52:11.530]  Signed.
[52:11.630 --> 52:12.810]  Signed on this very show.
[52:13.430 --> 52:14.150]  Rudy Gay.
[52:14.330 --> 52:14.630]  Uh-huh.
[52:15.790 --> 52:16.830]  O.G. Ananobi.
[52:16.970 --> 52:18.050]  Cracked Ice Prism.
[52:18.150 --> 52:19.250]  Whoa, Cracked Ice Prism.
[52:19.550 --> 52:20.390]  Reggie Bullock.
[52:20.490 --> 52:21.650]  Silver Parallel.
[52:21.710 --> 52:21.930]  Okay.
[52:23.150 --> 52:23.810]  Trey Jones.
[52:27.130 --> 52:28.510]  That's how you have to say it.
[52:28.970 --> 52:29.290]  There you go.
[52:30.090 --> 52:34.570]  Listen, I'm not going to say anything positive about the San Antonio Spurs because...
[52:35.130 --> 52:36.170]  What about when they're the Austin Spurs?
[52:36.370 --> 52:38.390]  Somehow they got Victor Wiminyama.
[52:38.490 --> 52:38.670]  Uh-huh.
[52:38.770 --> 52:39.530]  It's ridiculous.
[52:39.530 --> 52:41.630]  I can't wait to watch them play next year here.
[52:42.730 --> 52:44.230]  I will go to those.
[52:44.370 --> 52:44.470]  Yeah.
[52:44.790 --> 52:45.670]  Cade Cunningham.
[52:45.810 --> 52:46.110]  Base.
[52:46.330 --> 52:47.410]  Let's see what happens when he's healthy.
[52:47.570 --> 52:48.470]  Jay Crowder.
[52:50.130 --> 52:51.250]  Don't know what to say about Jay Crowder.
[52:51.410 --> 52:51.610]  No.
[52:53.050 --> 52:53.990]  Sons didn't want him.
[52:54.130 --> 52:54.890]  Still a good player.
[52:55.050 --> 52:55.870]  Ended up on Milwaukee.
[52:56.090 --> 52:59.030]  Milwaukee was getting their asses handed to them, but they never put him on the court.
[52:59.190 --> 53:00.690]  And the guy's like, what am I here for?
[53:00.750 --> 53:00.890]  Yeah.
[53:01.150 --> 53:01.870]  I always felt bad for him.
[53:01.990 --> 53:02.870]  He was good for the Celtics.
[53:03.390 --> 53:03.990]  Anthony Edwards.
[53:04.350 --> 53:04.670]  Dominance.
[53:05.290 --> 53:05.610]  Insert.
[53:06.130 --> 53:07.250]  E.J. Liddell.
[53:07.890 --> 53:08.770]  That's a very...
[53:09.910 --> 53:10.470]  Pack.
[53:10.970 --> 53:12.630]  That's an ehh-looking card, dude.
[53:13.010 --> 53:13.790]  He's just standing there.
[53:16.110 --> 53:18.550]  Jamal Murray having a phenomenal...
[53:18.550 --> 53:20.430]  They can't call him Bubble Murray anymore.
[53:20.550 --> 53:22.850]  He's having a legitimately phenomenal postseason.
[53:22.850 --> 53:30.690]  Crazy how the teams that were in the bubble in the finals were the teams that were in all the finals this year.
[53:30.810 --> 53:30.990]  Yeah.
[53:31.230 --> 53:31.970]  Very interesting.
[53:32.390 --> 53:36.390]  Almost like Bubble wasn't what made it...
[53:36.390 --> 53:37.430]  Much to consider.
[53:37.450 --> 53:38.410]  Almost like good players...
[53:38.410 --> 53:39.150]  Much to consider.
[53:39.610 --> 53:41.190]  Jonathan Isaac, Cracked Ice Parallel.
[53:42.090 --> 53:44.510]  Alec Burke's Green Prism Parallel.
[53:44.590 --> 53:46.490]  And Andrew Nembhard.
[53:47.010 --> 53:48.930]  This is a real dud of a box.
[53:48.930 --> 53:51.110]  But that means we're only halfway.
[53:51.670 --> 53:53.450]  And we got, what, three minutes left or whatever.
[53:53.590 --> 53:55.490]  So we get through these, there's going to be something...
[53:55.490 --> 53:56.650]  There should be one banger in here.
[53:56.650 --> 53:57.530]  In here, baby.
[53:57.830 --> 53:59.110]  Darius Garland.
[53:59.810 --> 54:00.590]  Denny Avija.
[54:03.290 --> 54:04.250]  Instant Impact.
[54:04.450 --> 54:05.470]  Shade and Sharp.
[54:06.270 --> 54:07.890]  Max Christy, Base Rookie.
[54:08.670 --> 54:10.550]  That pack might be worse than the last pack.
[54:13.070 --> 54:15.050]  That means one of these has to really hit.
[54:15.510 --> 54:16.710]  Something's going to go off, baby.
[54:17.830 --> 54:18.930]  Come on, hit me with it.
[54:19.010 --> 54:20.110]  Patty Mills, Base.
[54:22.450 --> 54:23.330]  Keep going.
[54:23.530 --> 54:24.990]  Tracy McGrady, Cracked Ice Parallel.
[54:24.990 --> 54:26.490]  Hey, all right, Tracy McGrady.
[54:26.670 --> 54:27.150]  There you go.
[54:27.370 --> 54:28.510]  Talk about a body breaking down.
[54:29.770 --> 54:32.130]  Trey Murphy III, Green Prism Parallel.
[54:32.130 --> 54:34.310]  And Josh Richardson, Base.
[54:34.890 --> 54:35.370]  Miscut.
[54:36.270 --> 54:36.750]  Cool.
[54:38.130 --> 54:39.090]  Last pack!
[54:39.930 --> 54:41.670]  Last pack mojo, as we say.
[54:42.190 --> 54:43.490]  Last pack mojo.
[54:43.710 --> 54:44.230]  Here we go.
[54:44.670 --> 54:45.670]  These are the final four cards, Eric.
[54:45.750 --> 54:45.950]  Yep.
[54:47.430 --> 54:47.750]  You ready?
[54:47.870 --> 54:48.090]  Yep.
[54:48.730 --> 54:49.670]  Tyrese Halliburton.
[54:49.830 --> 54:50.310]  Oh.
[54:50.710 --> 54:53.030]  I was reading, there was a report recently.
[54:53.330 --> 54:55.110]  Tyrese Halliburton, phenomenal player.
[54:55.890 --> 54:56.730]  Phenomenal year.
[54:56.870 --> 54:59.510]  He's been even better for the Pacers than he was for the Kings.
[54:59.510 --> 55:03.490]  There was a point when the Kings tried to trade him for Ben...
[55:04.790 --> 55:05.430]  What's his name?
[55:05.670 --> 55:06.070]  Ben Simmons.
[55:06.710 --> 55:06.790]  Yeah.
[55:07.150 --> 55:07.710]  Ben Simmons.
[55:08.470 --> 55:08.810]  That's weird.
[55:08.990 --> 55:09.610]  Straight up.
[55:10.490 --> 55:11.870]  Ben Simmons not even playing.
[55:11.990 --> 55:12.830]  And that may not play again.
[55:13.250 --> 55:13.990]  Drew Holliday.
[55:15.250 --> 55:16.830]  Benedict Mathurin, Instant Impact.
[55:17.210 --> 55:18.050]  He's a good rookie.
[55:18.630 --> 55:19.430]  Ugly Parallel.
[55:19.570 --> 55:19.710]  Yeah.
[55:19.890 --> 55:21.310]  And then Vince Williams, Base.
[55:21.390 --> 55:22.510]  How'd you feel about this pack, bud?
[55:22.650 --> 55:23.990]  That was a waste of $35.
[55:24.830 --> 55:25.430]  Pussy Slave.
[55:25.830 --> 55:26.890]  It was not Pussy Slave.
[55:26.890 --> 55:30.090]  That being said, we did end up...
[55:30.270 --> 55:31.250]  With an awesome...
[55:31.510 --> 55:31.950]  Big hit.
[55:32.350 --> 55:33.390]  Number to 25.
[55:33.870 --> 55:34.370]  Cam Thomas auto.
[55:34.490 --> 55:35.930]  It would be better if it wasn't a sticker auto.
[55:36.210 --> 55:36.350]  Yep.
[55:37.010 --> 55:37.990]  But it is what it is.
[55:38.110 --> 55:39.290]  It's still an awesome card.
[55:39.370 --> 55:39.490]  Yep.
[55:40.530 --> 55:41.790]  Thank you guys so much for watching.
[55:42.010 --> 55:42.550]  We've done it.
[55:42.670 --> 55:46.510]  We've sold vinyls way too fast and then had to fill time for the next 45 minutes.
[55:47.170 --> 55:47.930]  Thank you so much.
[55:49.570 --> 55:50.830]  Gerplers, June 23rd.
[55:50.870 --> 55:52.810]  I keep saying that like the date won't change.
[55:52.990 --> 55:53.470]  We'll see.
[55:55.030 --> 55:58.610]  But hopefully that is the day and we do another one of these and more of these to come.
[55:58.910 --> 55:59.970]  Guys, this is going to be a weekly show.
[56:00.890 --> 56:02.230]  Yeah, we keep saying that.
[56:04.190 --> 56:05.530]  Guys, this will be a weekly show.
[56:05.530 --> 56:06.570]  This will be a weekly show, gang.
[56:07.730 --> 56:08.850]  Guys, thank you so much for watching.
[56:09.290 --> 56:11.490]  The Fuckface vinyl is sold out now.
[56:11.830 --> 56:12.910]  And will we print it again?
[56:13.030 --> 56:16.190]  I keep saying no, but I have a feeling that I'm going to have to sit in a meeting and someone's going to go,
[56:16.250 --> 56:16.810]  We should do that again.
[56:17.470 --> 56:18.210]  And we'll see.
[56:19.190 --> 56:22.670]  Well, it's like we ran out of those Protected by Falcons.
[56:22.670 --> 56:24.630]  Yeah, we are making those again.
[56:24.910 --> 56:25.730]  We are going to make those again.
[56:25.730 --> 56:26.110]  Yes, we are making more of those.
[56:26.110 --> 56:28.730]  It feels like that's something easy to make again.
[56:28.730 --> 56:31.650]  We are, and I can let you know now, no scrumping signs also coming back.
[56:32.350 --> 56:33.150]  Oh, great.
[56:33.370 --> 56:33.690]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[56:33.690 --> 56:33.990]  There you go.
[56:34.030 --> 56:35.130]  So those will be back soon.

[56:41.790 --> 56:45.550]  r slash FuckfacePod, I think, on Reddit.
[56:45.750 --> 56:47.130]  I have no control over what happens there.
[56:47.490 --> 56:49.750]  So don't come to me and go, Oh, why would this happen?
[56:49.770 --> 56:50.210]  I don't know.
[56:50.390 --> 56:51.690]  I simply go there.
[56:51.690 --> 56:52.850]  Thank you so much for watching.
[56:53.090 --> 56:58.390]  Geoff is going to leave us with very wise words and something to really think about.
[56:58.510 --> 56:58.690]  Geoff?
[56:59.250 --> 57:00.750]  Brush your teeth three times a day.
[57:01.130 --> 57:02.770]  Floss every day of your life.
[57:04.610 --> 57:05.410]  Pussy slay.
[57:06.190 --> 57:07.250]  Spay and neuter your pets.
[57:10.150 --> 57:12.450]  Should have been playing the music probably the whole time for that.
[57:13.990 --> 57:16.310]  So we can just sort of like end it.
[57:29.500 --> 57:30.340]  Pussy slay.
