[00:11.890 --> 00:12.970]  Why would they do that?
[00:13.170 --> 00:17.330]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Break Show.
[00:17.750 --> 00:21.570]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, mostly always, Emily.
[00:21.810 --> 00:22.010]  Hi.
[00:22.230 --> 00:22.510]  Eric.
[00:22.650 --> 00:22.870]  Hello.
[00:23.090 --> 00:23.690]  Hello, friends.
[00:24.030 --> 00:24.190]  Hi.
[00:24.630 --> 00:25.370]  Hello, lover.
[00:25.710 --> 00:26.610]  Hello, lover.
[00:27.070 --> 00:28.230]  I was speaking to...
[00:28.230 --> 00:28.730]  You.
[00:28.970 --> 00:29.250]  Sucks.
[00:30.910 --> 00:31.950]  How's everybody doing today?
[00:32.050 --> 00:34.950]  Eric is showing us the NBA, the leaked NBA logo.
[00:34.950 --> 00:35.910]  Can you see that?
[00:36.010 --> 00:36.810]  What's the district?
[00:36.910 --> 00:37.650]  City jerseys.
[00:38.030 --> 00:38.710]  Do the overhead.
[00:40.270 --> 00:41.150]  That's terrible!
[00:41.850 --> 00:43.030]  Why are the pits stained?
[00:43.030 --> 00:43.810]  Is that the Wizards?
[00:44.150 --> 00:45.710]  Yeah. Pits stained teal.
[00:46.570 --> 00:47.670]  I just learned that Washington...
[00:47.670 --> 00:49.050]  It looks like a patina.
[00:49.250 --> 00:49.370]  Yeah.
[00:50.370 --> 00:52.990]  Washington Wizards were the state of Washington this whole time.
[00:53.010 --> 00:53.530]  You did not.
[00:53.890 --> 00:54.950]  You did not.
[00:54.970 --> 00:55.490]  I did!
[00:55.830 --> 00:59.510]  Because they have Golden State, which is the state of California,
[00:59.710 --> 01:02.070]  even though they're technically San Francisco, according to their city jersey.
[01:02.530 --> 01:05.390]  But the Washington Wizards, I just... I don't know.
[01:05.410 --> 01:06.530]  I don't really think about them that much.
[01:06.530 --> 01:07.610]  You know what? It makes sense.
[01:07.610 --> 01:08.250]  Thank you.
[01:08.430 --> 01:13.290]  I was probably... I think I was in fourth grade before I learned that
[01:13.290 --> 01:15.750]  Washington State and Washington D.C. were two different places.
[01:15.950 --> 01:16.510]  I knew that.
[01:16.530 --> 01:19.670]  And I learned in class by raising my hand to answer a question
[01:19.670 --> 01:21.350]  and then being told I was a moron.
[01:21.510 --> 01:24.250]  And then realizing I've had this wrong my whole short life.
[01:24.610 --> 01:25.710]  I'm feeling really dumb.
[01:26.070 --> 01:31.030]  Was that the teacher that you terrorized by putting her keys in the...
[01:31.610 --> 01:33.970]  It was a teacher that I terrorized.
[01:35.070 --> 01:37.330]  There weren't a lot of teachers that I didn't.
[01:37.330 --> 01:38.330]  Well, welcome to the show.
[01:38.450 --> 01:40.090]  The NLCS is very exciting.
[01:40.210 --> 01:43.510]  And that's why today we are opening...
[01:43.930 --> 01:47.730]  We're going to open up an autographed Hit Parade baseball bat.
[01:48.050 --> 01:49.070]  That's at the end of the show today.
[01:49.170 --> 01:51.470]  It's numbered 13 of 100.
[01:51.870 --> 01:52.670]  So we'll see.
[01:54.350 --> 01:56.170]  What do we want to get out of this, fellas?
[01:56.410 --> 01:56.890]  What do you think?
[01:56.950 --> 01:58.870]  I'm thinking, obviously, we want a Shohei Otani.
[01:59.030 --> 01:59.190]  Yeah.
[02:00.570 --> 02:02.330]  That's what I'm planning on getting out of this.
[02:02.350 --> 02:02.850]  You know what?
[02:03.290 --> 02:04.210]  I'll say the same thing.
[02:04.930 --> 02:05.230]  Why not?
[02:05.370 --> 02:05.730]  Grab a Shohei?
[02:05.730 --> 02:06.110]  Yeah.
[02:06.230 --> 02:07.750]  Yeah, we should grab a Shohei real quick.
[02:07.830 --> 02:09.250]  We'll manifest a Shohei.
[02:09.430 --> 02:10.150]  Yeah, I like that.
[02:10.610 --> 02:12.210]  What else do we have going on today, Geoff?
[02:12.310 --> 02:13.650]  Well, we've got some mail to open up.
[02:13.710 --> 02:16.610]  We'll take a stroll through the pack sack.
[02:17.110 --> 02:17.770]  We've got a...
[02:18.570 --> 02:19.150]  Pack sack?
[02:19.850 --> 02:21.910]  We've got a ton of other stuff to open.
[02:22.010 --> 02:24.570]  I was thinking we'd fuck around with some Alan and Ginter today because...
[02:24.570 --> 02:24.770]  Oh, yeah?
[02:25.090 --> 02:28.810]  I've now decided, since we've got the Jet Ski card...
[02:28.810 --> 02:28.950]  Yeah.
[02:30.410 --> 02:31.730]  We've got some cool autos.
[02:31.850 --> 02:32.750]  We've gotten some RIP cards.
[02:32.870 --> 02:34.290]  I want to chase a Wimby auto.
[02:34.570 --> 02:34.890]  Okay.
[02:35.710 --> 02:36.850]  Maybe we have...
[02:36.850 --> 02:37.390]  It's a hell of a chase.
[02:37.430 --> 02:38.070]  Hell of a chase, right?
[02:38.110 --> 02:38.950]  We might have a Wimby auto in there.
[02:39.070 --> 02:45.410]  And then also, I was looking at different Alan and Ginter parallels and I saw that you can maybe get a piece of T-Rex bone.
[02:46.070 --> 02:46.330]  Yeah.
[02:47.010 --> 02:47.690]  We need relics.
[02:47.950 --> 02:50.090]  So I wouldn't mind getting a T-Rex bone.
[02:50.210 --> 02:53.090]  You put it right there with like an Edgar Allan Poe poem or something?
[02:53.310 --> 02:53.630]  Yes.
[02:53.870 --> 02:55.050]  They call them Poe poems, yeah.
[02:55.050 --> 02:55.470]  Poe poem.
[02:55.670 --> 02:55.970]  Poe poem.
[02:56.910 --> 02:58.890]  Speaking of weird shit that we got...
[02:58.890 --> 02:59.010]  Yeah.
[02:59.230 --> 03:00.270]  Should we go over last week's?
[03:00.290 --> 03:00.630]  Yeah!
[03:00.950 --> 03:02.210]  Let's see what the hits are, baby.
[03:02.390 --> 03:03.390]  Let me pull out my notes.
[03:03.390 --> 03:04.850]  I've got to figure out how to make money on this.
[03:04.910 --> 03:05.630]  I really want to.
[03:05.630 --> 03:06.290]  Yeah, we're going to be rich.
[03:06.370 --> 03:08.630]  We're going to sell a card for $2,100 Tony style.
[03:08.870 --> 03:09.630]  Oh my God.
[03:10.690 --> 03:11.570]  Oh my God.
[03:11.590 --> 03:13.130]  We should have gone to D23, dude.
[03:13.210 --> 03:14.050]  We should have gone to D23.
[03:14.050 --> 03:15.630]  I'm ready for D24, homie.
[03:15.790 --> 03:17.870]  What is D23?
[03:18.450 --> 03:21.990]  Disney's convention where they go, hey, do you like Disneyland?
[03:22.950 --> 03:23.850]  Oh, for real?
[03:24.050 --> 03:24.250]  Yeah.
[03:24.650 --> 03:26.350]  Is it at Disneyland or is it Disney World?
[03:26.410 --> 03:29.810]  No, it's at the beautiful Anaheim Convention Center.
[03:29.930 --> 03:30.950]  So that's basically Disneyland.
[03:31.210 --> 03:31.390]  Yes.
[03:31.390 --> 03:35.490]  Oh, that's where MineCon and the other one that we went to together.
[03:35.610 --> 03:36.250]  Y'all went to...
[03:36.250 --> 03:36.990]  Oh, we went to VidCon.
[03:37.210 --> 03:37.530]  VidCon.
[03:37.670 --> 03:37.990]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:38.030 --> 03:38.390]  We were big.
[03:38.450 --> 03:39.890]  Me and Geoff were big VidCon guys.
[03:40.130 --> 03:41.670]  That was one of the worst experiences.
[03:42.670 --> 03:43.910]  That was a...
[03:43.910 --> 03:45.470]  That was a weird weekend, buddy.
[03:45.670 --> 03:45.830]  Yeah.
[03:45.930 --> 03:49.370]  Would you say it was the worst experience because I picked you up from VidCon, we were supposed
[03:49.370 --> 03:52.010]  to go to Disneyland, I said we have to fly home immediately because Henry's dying?
[03:52.130 --> 03:52.450]  Yes!
[03:52.490 --> 03:52.810]  Yes.
[03:53.070 --> 03:57.490]  But also, it was weird before we ever got to that because VidCon's just a weird place.
[03:57.490 --> 04:00.910]  I'd been a few years ago, but it is... it had changed a lot since I had been.
[04:01.030 --> 04:02.710]  And Eric and I were fish out of water.
[04:03.110 --> 04:06.750]  You gotta be like a TikTok guy now, and the only thing I watch on TikTok is Hamster Ray.
[04:08.170 --> 04:11.110]  Brandon Lowe, Alan and Ginter auto we got on card.
[04:11.430 --> 04:13.270]  What do you guys think this will run you, probably?
[04:13.730 --> 04:15.030]  On card auto, Brandon Lowe.
[04:15.030 --> 04:15.350]  31 bucks.
[04:15.530 --> 04:16.510]  I'm gonna take the under.
[04:16.850 --> 04:17.330]  The under.
[04:17.470 --> 04:18.010]  You would win.
[04:18.090 --> 04:18.450]  It's $10.
[04:18.950 --> 04:19.170]  What?
[04:19.390 --> 04:23.670]  Then we got this Nick Prado, Alan and Ginter relic rookie.
[04:24.210 --> 04:25.910]  That'll run you $5.
[04:26.370 --> 04:26.910]  Come on.
[04:26.910 --> 04:28.830]  Then, uh, mix it up a little bit.
[04:29.130 --> 04:31.410]  How much do you think this Darth Vader reflector is?
[04:31.830 --> 04:32.610]  $7.50.
[04:32.870 --> 04:33.930]  I'm gonna take the over.
[04:34.230 --> 04:34.730]  It's $5.
[04:35.730 --> 04:40.550]  Then, uh, here we have this Benedict Matherin green prism parallel rookie.
[04:40.690 --> 04:40.830]  $3.
[04:41.950 --> 04:42.990]  Uh, over.
[04:43.330 --> 04:43.830]  $20.
[04:44.690 --> 04:48.650]  And then the last card, which was the big hit of the week last week.
[04:48.730 --> 04:48.950]  Right.
[04:49.110 --> 04:53.390]  The tri-relic Rembrandt Michelangelo and Leonardo.
[04:53.390 --> 04:58.330]  You saw other things close to it for $24.
[04:58.670 --> 05:00.070]  I found exact comps.
[05:00.070 --> 05:00.470]  Really?
[05:00.770 --> 05:00.830]  Yeah.
[05:00.990 --> 05:02.270]  So you're gonna stay with $24?
[05:02.530 --> 05:04.710]  No, if you found exact comps, I'll say $70.
[05:05.170 --> 05:06.050]  I'm gonna go under.
[05:06.550 --> 05:07.090]  It's $50.
[05:07.330 --> 05:07.730]  Really?
[05:08.250 --> 05:09.110]  $50's not bad.
[05:09.170 --> 05:17.410]  So if you ever wanted to own a piece of Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Rembrandt, at least according to whoever the fuck made this, you can get it for $50 on eBay.
[05:17.610 --> 05:19.830]  Yeah, we'll sell it to you right now. No questions asked.
[05:19.950 --> 05:20.150]  $55.
[05:20.170 --> 05:21.070]  Yeah, just Venmo me.
[05:21.090 --> 05:21.250]  It's true.
[05:21.910 --> 05:24.730]  All right, let's crack into the pack sack and see what we got.
[05:24.870 --> 05:29.330]  Hey, I think we're doing this for Extra Life where we're gonna go through everything in the pack sack as much as we can.
[05:29.650 --> 05:36.390]  But I need to talk to you about what we can do to incentivize people donating, and I don't think you're gonna like my suggestions at all.
[05:36.530 --> 05:37.250]  Okay, great.
[05:37.530 --> 05:39.790]  I think I know the direction you're going with it.
[05:39.830 --> 05:41.950]  I think you're gonna want to say no, but I think I'm gonna have to.
[05:41.950 --> 05:43.710]  Here's the deal. I'm not Alfredo.
[05:43.850 --> 05:44.090]  Okay.
[05:44.170 --> 05:45.190]  I'm not gonna eat a card.
[05:45.290 --> 05:46.570]  No, I don't want you to eat them.
[05:46.850 --> 05:48.510]  I'm not gonna rip up a card that's worth money.
[05:50.210 --> 05:52.250]  But here's what I'm suggesting.
[05:52.530 --> 05:53.550]  Yeah, we should do that, though.
[05:53.730 --> 05:55.610]  Yeah, what if, like...
[05:55.610 --> 05:56.510]  What if, like...
[05:56.510 --> 05:56.790]  Okay.
[05:57.530 --> 06:01.530]  What if we get there, and then I'm supposed to cut it up, but then I can take, like, a dick punishment or something.
[06:01.990 --> 06:03.170]  What the fuck's a dick punishment?
[06:03.170 --> 06:06.090]  Like you hit me in the dick or something, if I don't have to cut it up.
[06:06.390 --> 06:07.890]  Oh, like what if...
[06:07.890 --> 06:10.650]  Okay, so what if you have to get on that horse that fucking pummels you?
[06:10.650 --> 06:12.710]  Oh, the pummel horse? I did that last year. That sucks.
[06:13.010 --> 06:15.510]  Yeah, or like you hit me in the dick with a baseball bat or something.
[06:15.670 --> 06:17.130]  Stop having me hit you in the dick.
[06:17.130 --> 06:19.550]  Or like maybe you hit me in the dick with a bowling ball.
[06:19.670 --> 06:19.950]  Stop!
[06:20.650 --> 06:23.450]  But yeah, but let's, like, what if we thought away from the dick?
[06:23.610 --> 06:25.230]  Like, what if, ooh, what if you have to eat...
[06:25.230 --> 06:26.030]  You shove something up my butt.
[06:26.090 --> 06:31.630]  Or what if you have to eat, like, sour cream or yogurt or cottage cheese?
[06:31.910 --> 06:33.310]  Would you want to get hit in the dick instead?
[06:34.130 --> 06:36.330]  I would much rather be hit in the dick.
[06:36.630 --> 06:37.930]  Like, you have to choose what you eat.
[06:38.170 --> 06:44.510]  I really have to come to you and suggest we have to tear up cards, but it has to be before we look, and it has to be, like...
[06:44.510 --> 06:47.190]  Well, we're gonna have to have that conversation.
[06:47.190 --> 06:47.850]  Yes, we are.
[06:47.910 --> 06:50.670]  What if it's a shredder and it's just a blind shredder?
[06:50.850 --> 06:51.750]  He doesn't know what he's shredding.
[06:52.210 --> 06:56.410]  That's what I want to suggest is, like, it's before we get to it.
[06:56.430 --> 06:56.830]  Oh, God.
[06:56.830 --> 07:05.010]  If there's a donation that comes in, like, right before, you have to, like, open it, keep your eyes closed, and, like, pick a card and tear...
[07:05.010 --> 07:05.650]  You know what I mean?
[07:05.750 --> 07:06.890]  Like, it has to be, like, that thick.
[07:06.910 --> 07:10.430]  But you can't tear a card that's a relic, so you wouldn't...
[07:10.430 --> 07:11.770]  We'd have to save those, of course.
[07:11.770 --> 07:12.670]  No, no.
[07:12.770 --> 07:14.270]  No, those get destroyed as well.
[07:14.450 --> 07:16.950]  Oh, what if we take them apart, like, rip cards?
[07:17.230 --> 07:17.570]  See?
[07:17.730 --> 07:18.350]  Oh, God.
[07:18.650 --> 07:20.170]  First pack we got today.
[07:20.470 --> 07:21.590]  Pulled out a pack sack.
[07:21.690 --> 07:22.890]  I've never seen this before.
[07:23.050 --> 07:24.770]  Saved by the bell of college years.
[07:24.910 --> 07:25.950]  I didn't even know this was a thing.
[07:26.030 --> 07:27.070]  You never watched the college years?
[07:27.190 --> 07:27.550]  No.
[07:27.850 --> 07:28.670]  No, I did.
[07:28.730 --> 07:30.630]  I didn't know they made fucking packs about it.
[07:30.670 --> 07:31.530]  I'm sure it's just...
[07:31.530 --> 07:35.030]  It's mostly stills from the show and promotional photos.
[07:35.070 --> 07:37.290]  Weren't they working at, like, a beach resort or something?
[07:37.450 --> 07:39.290]  No, that was the beach resort season.
[07:39.290 --> 07:42.010]  This is when they went to school, and they had this girl.
[07:42.130 --> 07:42.850]  Oh, yeah, Alex.
[07:43.450 --> 07:44.190]  That lady.
[07:44.510 --> 07:44.690]  Yep.
[07:44.930 --> 07:46.310]  Oh, God, I remember her.
[07:46.350 --> 07:46.450]  Yeah.
[07:46.650 --> 07:48.030]  She was in other stuff later.
[07:48.230 --> 07:52.170]  She was a classic, like, just, I don't know, character actress and stuff.
[07:52.210 --> 07:54.610]  She wasn't in Twin Peaks, but she looks like she would have been in Twin Peaks.
[07:54.610 --> 07:55.350]  Yeah, definitely.
[07:56.170 --> 07:57.830]  Leslie, Zach, and Kelly.
[07:58.430 --> 08:01.750]  Yeah, so it was, like, a love triangle type thing, but...
[08:01.750 --> 08:02.490]  Come on.
[08:02.870 --> 08:05.450]  Tiffany Evertheisen, still around on TikTok, writing books.
[08:05.750 --> 08:07.330]  She does chef stuff now.
[08:07.810 --> 08:08.210]  Yeah.
[08:08.210 --> 08:09.130]  Looks great.
[08:09.530 --> 08:09.930]  Mike.
[08:10.170 --> 08:12.050]  Yeah, Mike was a football player guy.
[08:12.330 --> 08:12.730]  Yeah.
[08:13.330 --> 08:14.830]  Alex again with double Alex.
[08:15.370 --> 08:15.770]  Oh!
[08:16.230 --> 08:17.230]  Oh, we're not done.
[08:17.490 --> 08:18.230]  There's more Mike.
[08:18.930 --> 08:19.870]  That's a lot of Mike.
[08:20.070 --> 08:22.470]  He was, like, the grown-up mentor dude, right?
[08:22.750 --> 08:22.890]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:23.170 --> 08:26.410]  He was, like, the guy who was hanging out with kids fresh out of high school.
[08:26.510 --> 08:26.770]  Uh-huh.
[08:26.850 --> 08:27.890]  Right, no, he's probably...
[08:27.890 --> 08:31.570]  Everyone in these photos is 18 except Mike, who's 21.
[08:32.250 --> 08:34.390]  Mike was a guy who doesn't exist in 2023.
[08:34.650 --> 08:34.850]  Yep.
[08:35.010 --> 08:36.050]  Yeah, but in the 90s.
[08:36.130 --> 08:36.430]  Uh-huh.
[08:36.430 --> 08:37.030]  Here we go.
[08:37.110 --> 08:38.410]  Zach looking wide.
[08:38.690 --> 08:39.630]  Really wide.
[08:39.750 --> 08:41.870]  It's his hair and the shirt.
[08:41.950 --> 08:42.770]  The shirt is wide.
[08:42.890 --> 08:44.030]  Yeah, it's not a look, man.
[08:44.950 --> 08:45.770]  Rest in peace.
[08:46.190 --> 08:46.510]  Screech.
[08:46.630 --> 08:47.250]  Dustin Diamond.
[08:47.390 --> 08:48.290]  Remember that he died.
[08:48.310 --> 08:49.150]  Oh, he fucking died.
[08:49.150 --> 08:50.490]  Didn't he have a porno, too?
[08:50.670 --> 08:51.470]  He had a porno.
[08:51.830 --> 08:52.410]  He had a...
[08:52.410 --> 08:53.910]  Yeah, he died and he had a porno.
[08:53.990 --> 08:54.510]  He had a...
[08:54.510 --> 08:55.350]  He had a...
[08:55.350 --> 08:59.130]  He followed up Saved by the Bell with educational chess videos for a while.
[08:59.190 --> 08:59.990]  I don't know if you remember those.
[09:00.030 --> 09:00.370]  Uh-huh.
[09:00.470 --> 09:00.970]  That was rough.
[09:01.190 --> 09:02.230]  Then he was on...
[09:02.230 --> 09:04.470]  What was the reality show on VH1?
[09:04.890 --> 09:05.210]  Uh...
[09:06.070 --> 09:06.670]  Surreal Life.
[09:06.850 --> 09:07.330]  And then he died.
[09:08.410 --> 09:09.310]  There's more Zach.
[09:09.550 --> 09:10.390]  More wide shirts.
[09:10.810 --> 09:12.090]  That was such a haircut.
[09:12.550 --> 09:14.810]  Speaking of wide, here's Mike and Screech.
[09:15.710 --> 09:16.510]  Jesus Christ.
[09:16.930 --> 09:17.170]  Wow.
[09:17.410 --> 09:18.530]  You really see the size difference.
[09:18.650 --> 09:19.850]  Dude, look at that hair.
[09:20.230 --> 09:21.130]  That's awesome.
[09:21.330 --> 09:22.730]  Let's wrap it up with a Zach and Mike.
[09:22.890 --> 09:23.830]  Dude, that...
[09:23.830 --> 09:25.030]  Geoff, grow your hair like that.
[09:25.130 --> 09:25.350]  Yeah.
[09:29.550 --> 09:30.570]  That was fun.
[09:30.670 --> 09:31.330]  That was the pack sack.
[09:31.670 --> 09:32.570]  We also got some mail.
[09:32.750 --> 09:33.710]  We just tear the card.
[09:33.710 --> 09:34.470]  Yeah.
[09:37.230 --> 09:37.610]  Oh.
[09:38.430 --> 09:40.670]  I feel like there's gotta be...
[09:40.670 --> 09:41.490]  Got some...
[09:42.790 --> 09:43.170]  Stickers.
[09:43.430 --> 09:44.190]  But what's the limit?
[09:44.350 --> 09:44.970]  Like, what is the...
[09:44.970 --> 09:45.930]  There's no limit.
[09:46.010 --> 09:46.890]  People donate.
[09:46.990 --> 09:47.690]  We gotta follow through.
[09:47.870 --> 09:49.930]  So does a rip count as a dollar?
[09:50.150 --> 09:50.610]  Or like...
[09:50.610 --> 09:51.230]  No, no, no.
[09:51.290 --> 09:53.790]  It's gotta be like a leap donation to tear shit up.
[09:53.810 --> 09:54.870]  Somebody sent us some angry stickers.
[09:55.330 --> 09:56.050]  Fuck the police.
[09:56.170 --> 09:57.070]  Frog and Ted.
[09:57.090 --> 09:57.910]  Oh, that's cool.
[09:58.230 --> 09:58.630]  With authority.
[09:58.810 --> 09:59.390]  Frog and Toad.
[09:59.950 --> 10:00.330]  Prison...
[10:00.330 --> 10:00.930]  Yeah.
[10:01.350 --> 10:02.750]  We can put those on our...
[10:02.750 --> 10:03.630]  Yeah, we'll put those on the wall.
[10:03.730 --> 10:07.030]  Then it says, hello to Geoff, Emily, Eric, Chat, and whoever is joining you today.
[10:07.090 --> 10:11.210]  I used to collect these weird and wild creature trading cards...
[10:11.210 --> 10:11.750]  I love creatures.
[10:12.030 --> 10:12.110]  ...when I was a kid.
[10:12.790 --> 10:15.070]  Got them through the Ranger Rick Animal Fact Magazine.
[10:15.170 --> 10:15.510]  It's very cool.
[10:15.550 --> 10:16.030]  Fun facts.
[10:16.970 --> 10:17.330]  Here's...
[10:17.330 --> 10:18.310]  No game or anything.
[10:18.470 --> 10:20.950]  Just a neat little thing to have of varying sizes.
[10:21.110 --> 10:22.310]  There's two sealed for the stream.
[10:22.770 --> 10:26.390]  And a sack pack one that's already open because I had to make sure I ordered the right thing.
[10:26.650 --> 10:27.510]  I love The Break Show.
[10:28.010 --> 10:29.650]  And Hot Face, and Anma, and Saw Right.
[10:29.750 --> 10:30.330]  Please never stop.
[10:30.730 --> 10:31.410]  Thanks, Andrew.
[10:31.410 --> 10:32.530]  Andrew, thank you.
[10:32.550 --> 10:33.410]  Thank you for the cards.
[10:34.270 --> 10:35.050]  That was nice of him.
[10:35.150 --> 10:36.130]  He didn't have to do that.
[10:36.390 --> 10:37.530]  Thank you for plugging...
[10:38.330 --> 10:41.250]  Thank you for making me plug Saw Right and Anma.
[10:41.470 --> 10:42.810]  What if we grind...
[10:42.810 --> 10:44.350]  What if we sharpen a pencil?
[10:45.550 --> 10:47.010]  And then make it into like a muffin.
[10:47.330 --> 10:47.530]  Yeah.
[10:47.630 --> 10:48.810]  And then you have to eat the pencil.
[10:49.410 --> 10:51.050]  I'm not the one that has to eat the pencil.
[10:51.690 --> 10:52.610]  If I had to...
[10:52.610 --> 10:54.370]  Right, but for some reason we're going to try to get you to do that.
[10:54.630 --> 10:57.930]  If I had to eat the pencil, I would have eaten the pencil on camera.
[10:57.930 --> 11:02.030]  You put on the Andrew mask, and then you eat the muffin with the pencil.
[11:02.030 --> 11:04.530]  No, because that absolves Andrew of all responsibility, and I won't be having that.
[11:04.530 --> 11:07.190]  Yeah, because then he'll assume he's in some sort of a loophole.
[11:07.270 --> 11:08.330]  Yes, yes, that is true.
[11:08.370 --> 11:09.510]  Lawyers will get involved.
[11:10.010 --> 11:10.350]  We will be.
[11:10.530 --> 11:11.450]  Hacksack these two.
[11:11.450 --> 11:11.630]  Yep.
[11:11.790 --> 11:12.970]  We're going to open up...
[11:12.970 --> 11:15.090]  I got to admit, I've never seen these before.
[11:15.270 --> 11:15.570]  Creatures?
[11:16.310 --> 11:18.170]  Weird and wild creatures.
[11:18.230 --> 11:19.270]  Weird and wild.
[11:20.030 --> 11:20.790]  Hey, parents.
[11:21.310 --> 11:22.510]  Cool stuff for your kids.
[11:23.210 --> 11:24.270]  Rip open now.
[11:24.370 --> 11:24.670]  Okay.
[11:25.030 --> 11:25.410]  All right.
[11:26.810 --> 11:27.430]  Let's see.
[11:27.470 --> 11:28.250]  This is for kids.
[11:28.690 --> 11:29.170]  Ooh.
[11:29.210 --> 11:30.110]  This is fun to open.
[11:30.450 --> 11:31.070]  You like...
[11:31.070 --> 11:31.310]  Weird.
[11:31.890 --> 11:32.510]  I like this.
[11:34.010 --> 11:34.970]  T-Rex.
[11:34.990 --> 11:35.290]  Cool.
[11:35.930 --> 11:36.990]  Monsters of the past.
[11:37.050 --> 11:37.810]  That's card number one.
[11:37.970 --> 11:38.710]  Card number 20.
[11:39.690 --> 11:40.170]  Wolverine.
[11:40.210 --> 11:40.470]  Yes.
[11:44.250 --> 11:45.150]  Some gifts.
[11:45.330 --> 11:47.070]  The Wolverine is how Geoff sees himself.
[11:47.450 --> 11:48.110]  Yes, that's true.
[11:48.390 --> 11:48.970]  Card number eight.
[11:49.030 --> 11:49.730]  Great white shark.
[11:49.810 --> 11:50.230]  Nice.
[11:50.410 --> 11:51.370]  That's how Emily sees herself.
[11:51.490 --> 11:51.650]  Yeah.
[11:52.190 --> 11:52.450]  Yeah.
[11:53.330 --> 11:54.530]  Oh, and then we get...
[11:54.530 --> 11:55.500]  Oh, look at a little, like...
[11:56.410 --> 11:57.250]  Additional creatures?
[11:57.590 --> 11:58.310]  Additional creatures.
[11:58.470 --> 11:59.090]  Baby creatures.
[11:59.510 --> 12:00.530]  I love the creatures.
[12:00.870 --> 12:01.510]  I like...
[12:01.510 --> 12:02.210]  They're fun facts.
[12:02.330 --> 12:02.650]  Let's see.
[12:02.690 --> 12:03.030]  Best in peace.
[12:03.030 --> 12:04.130]  Let me learn about me.
[12:05.150 --> 12:09.550]  It's huge jaws, razor-sharp teeth, enormous strength, and monster-sized make the great
[12:09.550 --> 12:11.190]  white shark the most feared killer in the ocean.
[12:11.390 --> 12:11.970]  That's me.
[12:12.610 --> 12:14.130]  Geoff's Tasmanian, so you're T-Rex?
[12:14.450 --> 12:15.190]  Sure, that works for me.
[12:15.470 --> 12:16.810]  I got Cerberus.
[12:17.010 --> 12:17.770]  Wow, that's us.
[12:18.190 --> 12:21.430]  We got Anaconda.
[12:21.430 --> 12:22.570]  Ooh, that's your favorite.
[12:22.810 --> 12:24.790]  I don't like snakes, but I do like that movie.
[12:25.450 --> 12:27.550]  What if you could hold a snake during Extra Life?
[12:29.250 --> 12:29.930]  For a certain amount.
[12:30.130 --> 12:30.990]  I don't think you can do it.
[12:32.270 --> 12:32.630]  How...
[12:32.630 --> 12:33.950]  And I say this with all due respect.
[12:35.190 --> 12:36.510]  And I'm about to marry you.
[12:36.950 --> 12:38.510]  But how about you go fuck off?
[12:39.330 --> 12:39.970]  How about you go...
[12:39.970 --> 12:41.030]  How about you don't...
[12:41.030 --> 12:42.070]  How about you don't...
[12:42.070 --> 12:42.550]  It's a gentle snake.
[12:42.810 --> 12:43.090]  Fuck you.
[12:43.270 --> 12:43.690]  How about this?
[12:43.870 --> 12:45.990]  How about you don't find the limits of our relationship?
[12:47.130 --> 12:47.490]  Wow.
[12:49.950 --> 12:50.310]  Fucking...
[12:50.950 --> 12:52.290]  What if we got a falcon?
[12:53.210 --> 12:54.170]  That's not a punishment!
[12:56.350 --> 12:57.330]  Poison dart frog.
[12:57.430 --> 12:58.730]  What if you eat a poison dart frog?
[12:59.130 --> 13:00.490]  Oh yeah, I'd probably...
[13:00.490 --> 13:01.210]  I mean...
[13:01.210 --> 13:02.050]  Oh, I'm gonna die now!
[13:02.310 --> 13:03.690]  I have...
[13:03.690 --> 13:06.310]  There are some drugs that have been volunteered.
[13:07.290 --> 13:09.910]  That made you feel like you could poison a dart frog?
[13:10.530 --> 13:14.350]  You can go on a journey if you involve frogs and toad venom.
[13:14.470 --> 13:17.750]  That happened in college where I had a roommate who took some stuff...
[13:17.750 --> 13:18.350]  Licked a toad.
[13:18.350 --> 13:19.110]  And he was like...
[13:19.110 --> 13:19.730]  It didn't even do anything.
[13:19.850 --> 13:20.110]  Watch.
[13:20.270 --> 13:20.970]  And then he went...
[13:20.970 --> 13:21.530]  This is like...
[13:21.530 --> 13:21.790]  Watch.
[13:21.830 --> 13:23.030]  And he just starts doing push-ups.
[13:23.590 --> 13:24.330]  And we went...
[13:24.330 --> 13:25.030]  What are you doing?
[13:25.070 --> 13:25.370]  He's like...
[13:25.370 --> 13:26.110]  Proving that I'm...
[13:26.110 --> 13:27.150]  That everything's normal.
[13:32.050 --> 13:34.490]  We got some jungle animal cards.
[13:34.650 --> 13:35.170]  That's what they're called.
[13:35.670 --> 13:37.790]  So we got a deer or ibex or something.
[13:38.030 --> 13:39.910]  And then a crab.
[13:40.190 --> 13:40.730]  Jungle animals.
[13:40.810 --> 13:41.330]  Two creatures.
[13:41.570 --> 13:42.250]  Yeah, two creatures.
[13:42.410 --> 13:42.730]  And then...
[13:42.730 --> 13:44.650]  This is somebody else, but they didn't include a note.
[13:44.710 --> 13:46.890]  They did send a bunch of cards.
[13:47.090 --> 13:47.970]  I really appreciate that.
[13:47.970 --> 13:49.310]  Oh, and then two loose ones.
[13:49.430 --> 13:49.730]  Oh, look.
[13:49.810 --> 13:50.750]  We got another...
[13:50.750 --> 13:51.810]  I never even heard of the college years.
[13:51.970 --> 13:52.410]  And here's another...
[13:52.410 --> 13:52.990]  That's the professor.
[13:53.750 --> 13:54.770]  And then here we have...
[13:54.770 --> 13:56.070]  He's the same age as the kids.
[13:56.830 --> 13:58.830]  1991 Simon Ladder Towers Model F.
[13:58.830 --> 13:59.650]  Oh, wow.
[14:00.750 --> 14:02.170]  I'll probably save this for the truck boys.
[14:02.510 --> 14:03.090]  That's cool.
[14:03.270 --> 14:03.850]  We'll probably talk about that tonight.
[14:03.850 --> 14:04.970]  Do you do fire engine stuff?
[14:05.210 --> 14:07.790]  No, but I'm into all trucks now.
[14:07.850 --> 14:08.090]  Watch.
[14:08.210 --> 14:13.030]  There was some truck action recorded for a Let's Play that we'll see if it is a video
[14:13.030 --> 14:14.830]  where Andrew's trying his best.
[14:16.250 --> 14:16.610]  Dude.
[14:17.770 --> 14:20.110]  Oh, so they sent us a bunch of stuff.
[14:20.170 --> 14:20.630]  Yeah, what do we got?
[14:20.850 --> 14:22.050]  We got a lot of stuff we've seen before.
[14:22.130 --> 14:24.370]  We got some Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.
[14:24.410 --> 14:24.970]  We got some Bingo.
[14:25.530 --> 14:25.970]  Bingo!
[14:27.350 --> 14:27.790]  Iditarod.
[14:27.830 --> 14:28.570]  I want to open those.
[14:28.570 --> 14:28.790]  Oh, that's fun.
[14:29.210 --> 14:31.370]  Then Spoofy Toons.
[14:31.830 --> 14:32.730]  Maverick the Movie.
[14:33.370 --> 14:33.810]  Pocahontas.
[14:34.150 --> 14:34.730]  VR Troopers.
[14:35.670 --> 14:36.110]  Anastasia.
[14:36.550 --> 14:36.990]  Decision92.
[14:38.250 --> 14:39.110]  Hyborian Gates.
[14:39.570 --> 14:41.390]  The game where magic and technology meet.
[14:41.470 --> 14:42.630]  That sounds like...
[14:42.630 --> 14:43.610]  Tech War.
[14:43.790 --> 14:45.110]  Can we...
[14:45.110 --> 14:47.630]  You're donating a lot to Sack Pack and everything.
[14:47.750 --> 14:48.510]  This is all going to Sack Pack.
[14:49.050 --> 14:50.330]  Can we do Spoofy Toons?
[14:50.430 --> 14:52.010]  Because it seems like they're going to fucking suck.
[14:52.270 --> 14:53.310]  I'd love to get into it.
[14:53.310 --> 14:54.550]  Alright, we're going to do Spoofy Toons.
[14:54.590 --> 14:55.790]  Alright, all these are going to Pack Sack.
[14:55.910 --> 14:57.070]  You'll watch us open at Extra Life.
[14:57.710 --> 14:58.390]  Extra Life.
[14:59.070 --> 15:00.630]  Who knows? Maybe they get torn up.
[15:01.470 --> 15:02.830]  Not the Spoofy Toons.
[15:03.410 --> 15:04.890]  Alright, let's lead with Spoofy Toons.
[15:04.930 --> 15:05.570]  Oh, wow!
[15:06.670 --> 15:07.470]  Butt Neds.
[15:07.810 --> 15:08.210]  Trading.
[15:08.490 --> 15:09.270]  Butt Heads.
[15:09.470 --> 15:10.110]  Butt Neds!
[15:11.330 --> 15:12.550]  This is my kind of comedy.
[15:12.550 --> 15:15.570]  Look for special limited edition insert cards.
[15:15.650 --> 15:17.150]  55 different cards in all.
[15:17.210 --> 15:18.950]  This is going to suck. I can't wait.
[15:19.210 --> 15:22.350]  I just hope it's not overtly offensive.
[15:23.110 --> 15:23.630]  Oh.
[15:24.310 --> 15:26.990]  Maybe you scan them first.
[15:28.050 --> 15:29.510]  Yeah, but I don't know what is offensive.
[15:29.510 --> 15:30.510]  There you go. Throw it down, baby.
[15:30.790 --> 15:32.030]  Pee Wee's Yard Sale.
[15:32.530 --> 15:32.950]  Yeah!
[15:33.750 --> 15:34.510]  R.I.P.
[15:34.870 --> 15:35.570]  Keep going.
[15:36.590 --> 15:37.790]  That's probably funny.
[15:40.110 --> 15:41.150]  Pee Wee.
[15:42.070 --> 15:44.110]  I'm not going to show this one.
[15:44.210 --> 15:44.870]  Oh, wow!
[15:45.490 --> 15:46.510]  These are great.
[15:46.670 --> 15:47.130]  Thanksgiving.
[15:47.690 --> 15:48.670]  Let's see Thanksgiving.
[15:49.710 --> 15:51.410]  Eating a leg, that's crazy.
[15:51.710 --> 15:52.670]  Behind the scenes.
[15:52.890 --> 15:53.290]  Whoa!
[15:54.270 --> 15:54.790]  Jesus.
[15:55.470 --> 15:56.030]  Yeah, right?
[15:56.150 --> 15:57.290]  Jesus Christ.
[15:57.330 --> 15:58.070]  Yeah, we can't show that one.
[15:58.070 --> 15:58.490]  No.
[15:58.890 --> 15:59.130]  Really?
[15:59.410 --> 15:59.730]  What was he?
[16:00.910 --> 16:02.770]  A fridge too far.
[16:02.770 --> 16:03.550]  Oh, my God!
[16:04.390 --> 16:05.530]  What year is this?
[16:05.590 --> 16:06.750]  Don't show these cards!
[16:08.330 --> 16:08.730]  Whoa!
[16:08.910 --> 16:09.370]  I'm not going to show that one.
[16:09.370 --> 16:10.470]  These are not funny.
[16:12.290 --> 16:13.890]  Oh, my God.
[16:14.090 --> 16:14.790]  These are crazy!
[16:15.710 --> 16:16.470]  You know what?
[16:16.650 --> 16:18.030]  Here's one of the least offensive ones.
[16:18.610 --> 16:21.330]  That baby fell out of the swing and died.
[16:21.410 --> 16:21.990]  Goodbye, baby.
[16:22.050 --> 16:22.450]  Goodbye, baby.
[16:23.110 --> 16:24.230]  Here's a jacked Oprah.
[16:24.570 --> 16:25.030]  This is...
[16:25.030 --> 16:25.310]  There you go.
[16:26.010 --> 16:26.410]  Wow.
[16:26.670 --> 16:29.350]  This is 1993, so this is 20 years ago.
[16:29.370 --> 16:30.510]  That's the year I graduated high school.
[16:30.930 --> 16:32.050]  I graduated high school from a different...
[16:32.050 --> 16:32.550]  We did it, y'all.
[16:32.590 --> 16:33.410]  We came a long way.
[16:33.850 --> 16:35.470]  Let's never show these.
[16:35.590 --> 16:36.330]  What the fuck?
[16:36.330 --> 16:38.870]  How about we test out the shredder with those?
[16:39.170 --> 16:39.430]  Yeah.
[16:39.570 --> 16:39.830]  All right.
[16:39.830 --> 16:40.150]  You know what?
[16:40.190 --> 16:41.250]  I will rip some cards up.
[16:41.270 --> 16:42.010]  I'll rip those up.
[16:42.710 --> 16:43.810]  That's not how it works.
[16:43.890 --> 16:44.170]  Damn.
[16:45.870 --> 16:46.090]  Wow.
[16:46.290 --> 16:47.950]  Four shame spoofy tuners.
[16:48.410 --> 16:48.790]  Jeez.
[16:51.210 --> 16:51.610]  Uh...
[16:51.610 --> 16:53.170]  What the fuck are these?
[16:53.230 --> 16:53.990]  I did a rad cards.
[16:54.430 --> 16:54.990]  John Baron.
[16:55.310 --> 16:58.310]  Wasn't that Donald Trump's spokesperson in the 80s?
[16:58.690 --> 16:59.870]  Now we know where he hid.
[17:00.750 --> 17:02.010]  We all just thought it was Trump.
[17:02.370 --> 17:03.970]  Well, we all just thought it was Trump.
[17:03.990 --> 17:04.190]  What?
[17:04.870 --> 17:08.190]  That was the name of his spokesperson in the 80s was John Baron.
[17:08.490 --> 17:09.090]  But it was him.
[17:09.290 --> 17:09.890]  It was him.
[17:09.890 --> 17:11.450]  He would call me like, oh, this is John Baron.
[17:12.430 --> 17:14.370]  Yeah, there's audiotapes of it.
[17:14.510 --> 17:16.410]  And that's him being like, I'm like a...
[17:16.410 --> 17:20.630]  He's like, I'm just calling to clear up some inaccuracies in this article of Mr. Trump.
[17:20.690 --> 17:21.030]  Interesting.
[17:21.190 --> 17:22.630]  He's richer than you wrote.
[17:24.490 --> 17:25.210]  Levon Barvey.
[17:26.590 --> 17:26.910]  Great.
[17:27.310 --> 17:28.670]  Oh, the old pit road.
[17:28.930 --> 17:29.910]  I wanna see dogs.
[17:29.930 --> 17:31.290]  Yeah, show me some fucking dogs, bro.
[17:31.550 --> 17:33.490]  What if I showed you a cripple?
[17:34.310 --> 17:34.790]  Oh.
[17:34.790 --> 17:35.810]  I don't know what that means.
[17:36.030 --> 17:38.270]  Is this from the Tootie Toons thing?
[17:38.270 --> 17:39.050]  No, this is...
[17:40.110 --> 17:42.310]  It's probably, like, a cripple is probably a thing, right?
[17:42.350 --> 17:42.590]  Yeah.
[17:43.430 --> 17:51.430]  John Runyon and Doug Swinglay did not take their mandatory 24-hour rest until they had passed Cripple, the halfway point on the northern route.
[17:51.770 --> 17:56.750]  Silver Bowl and the $3,000 in ingots presented by Alaskom was shared.
[17:56.810 --> 17:57.630]  You better stay away from that.
[17:57.710 --> 17:58.070]  Ingots.
[17:58.450 --> 18:00.330]  That shit, you have been cursed enough.
[18:00.670 --> 18:00.970]  Oof.
[18:00.970 --> 18:07.670]  The strategy was to distance themselves in front of all others and hopefully have the weather deteriorate behind them so that their followers would be delayed.
[18:08.110 --> 18:09.150]  I.E. killed.
[18:09.970 --> 18:12.670]  Jules Meade, Joanna Potts.
[18:13.230 --> 18:14.450]  What are these?
[18:14.470 --> 18:15.310]  That lady looks like Howard Stern.
[18:15.330 --> 18:17.170]  I'm ready for their...
[18:17.170 --> 18:17.810]  Where's dogs?
[18:17.950 --> 18:19.290]  Here's the 1978 champion.
[18:19.310 --> 18:20.070]  There's a dog!
[18:20.590 --> 18:20.790]  Yay!
[18:20.810 --> 18:22.130]  Yay, you did it!
[18:22.290 --> 18:22.970]  Matt DeSalernos.
[18:23.650 --> 18:24.290]  Oh, my God.
[18:24.470 --> 18:25.990]  Yeah, that's fucking...
[18:25.990 --> 18:28.370]  That guy looks like most people in Austin.
[18:28.370 --> 18:30.750]  Yeah, all I know is that guy...
[18:30.750 --> 18:32.690]  I bought drinks from that dude for five years.
[18:32.690 --> 18:33.070]  100%.
[18:33.070 --> 18:33.590]  On E6.
[18:34.150 --> 18:35.650]  I want to do something with that car.
[18:37.290 --> 18:38.810]  There's the 1988 champion.
[18:39.070 --> 18:40.370]  No! Two dogs!
[18:40.930 --> 18:42.390]  Here's a piece of a map.
[18:42.650 --> 18:44.450]  You put the map together, then you can know Earth.
[18:44.810 --> 18:45.310]  Oh, finally.
[18:45.730 --> 18:47.310]  This guy won seven years.
[18:47.430 --> 18:50.890]  Career winnings, Matt has been a top 20 competitor for six years in a row.
[18:50.990 --> 18:56.550]  Being a known resident allows him to train in his homegrown dog team on the shores of Norton Sound every year.
[18:57.270 --> 18:57.710]  Now...
[18:58.290 --> 18:59.490]  But I... there's...
[18:59.490 --> 19:01.190]  We're gonna open up some...
[19:01.190 --> 19:02.750]  We're gonna open up some bingos.
[19:03.430 --> 19:03.990]  Oh, we got bingo?
[19:04.110 --> 19:06.930]  As you know, bingo, we're looking for a bingo candidate.
[19:06.970 --> 19:07.150]  Yep.
[19:07.590 --> 19:09.450]  That's the chase card for bingo.
[19:10.290 --> 19:11.870]  Bad time for a phone call!
[19:11.890 --> 19:13.030]  Oh, I remember that one, yeah.
[19:13.390 --> 19:14.090]  His dad's a kicker.
[19:14.350 --> 19:15.330]  Let's play!
[19:15.370 --> 19:15.670]  Bingo!
[19:16.390 --> 19:17.570]  Is that y'all?
[19:17.990 --> 19:18.950]  Name is Us.
[19:19.090 --> 19:19.930]  Is that you, Andrew?
[19:21.310 --> 19:23.470]  It's the dog in Ray Narvaez Jr.
[19:24.270 --> 19:26.450]  We have the sequel to the other card.
[19:26.450 --> 19:28.250]  Miss all my field goals!
[19:28.570 --> 19:29.010]  Oh my god.
[19:29.830 --> 19:32.510]  Uh, these guys are... scared stiff.
[19:33.490 --> 19:35.610]  Uh, the order she blows!
[19:36.070 --> 19:37.550]  Not a lot of bingo in these bingo cards.
[19:37.630 --> 19:38.670]  The right choice.
[19:38.870 --> 19:40.270]  That was a movie I saw when I was a kid.
[19:40.950 --> 19:42.390]  Fire under control.
[19:42.630 --> 19:43.470]  There's... there's bingo.
[19:43.630 --> 19:44.510]  Oh my god, dude.
[19:45.130 --> 19:46.390]  Let the boy go!
[19:47.930 --> 19:49.490]  Everyone pulls for bingo.
[19:50.330 --> 19:50.730]  Well, because...
[19:50.730 --> 19:52.010]  Wait, is he in a hospital bed?
[19:52.010 --> 19:52.930]  Oh my god!
[19:53.610 --> 19:54.690]  Bingo's in the hospital?
[19:54.950 --> 19:55.430]  I'll save that.
[19:55.430 --> 19:56.670]  And then, check this out.
[19:57.090 --> 19:57.750]  Fear of flames.
[19:59.090 --> 20:00.230]  Bingo can't do it!
[20:00.470 --> 20:01.250]  Bingo can't do it.
[20:01.510 --> 20:01.790]  Oh boy.
[20:02.590 --> 20:03.850]  There we go, that was awesome.
[20:04.150 --> 20:05.050]  Thank you for those cards.
[20:05.990 --> 20:07.570]  Uh, let's open some real...
[20:07.570 --> 20:07.770]  Yeah, let's do it.
[20:07.950 --> 20:09.830]  Let's open some real stuff that's good.
[20:10.050 --> 20:12.790]  Let's open 2019 Alan and Getter.
[20:12.970 --> 20:14.190]  2023 Alan and Getter.
[20:14.230 --> 20:14.370]  Cool.
[20:14.570 --> 20:15.510]  Try to get that T-Rex.
[20:15.610 --> 20:16.630]  Try to get that Victor Windman.
[20:16.630 --> 20:16.770]  I'm ready.
[20:17.250 --> 20:17.750]  Let's do it.
[20:19.390 --> 20:21.710]  Maybe get some, uh...
[20:21.710 --> 20:23.330]  anime voice actors again.
[20:23.330 --> 20:25.110]  There we got Derek Jeter, the captain.
[20:26.110 --> 20:27.290]  Uh, Julio Arias.
[20:27.570 --> 20:28.510]  Oh, you might want to throw that away.
[20:28.730 --> 20:29.710]  Probably don't need that one.
[20:31.390 --> 20:32.710]  Uh, Olly Palmer.
[20:34.330 --> 20:34.950]  Kyle Tucker.
[20:35.970 --> 20:37.270]  Oh, Scoot Henderson.
[20:38.090 --> 20:38.770]  That's not bad.
[20:38.910 --> 20:39.450]  We'll take that.
[20:39.550 --> 20:40.910]  We'll go ahead and sleeve that, please.
[20:42.450 --> 20:44.130]  Uh, Christopher Morel.
[20:44.410 --> 20:45.430]  Morel, I don't know him.
[20:46.430 --> 20:49.610]  We have our mini is gonna be...
[20:49.610 --> 20:51.070]  Oh, it's an Alan and Getter back.
[20:51.290 --> 20:52.090]  George Kirby.
[20:52.090 --> 20:53.550]  So, let me show you that.
[20:53.730 --> 20:56.970]  These back cards, the mini cards, they have different parallels, right?
[20:57.510 --> 20:59.630]  But a lot of times the parallels are just the back.
[21:00.210 --> 21:02.630]  And so this is what's called an Alan and Getter back.
[21:02.690 --> 21:03.890]  Because it says Alan and Getter on it.
[21:03.950 --> 21:05.770]  And it's different from the original, the normal back.
[21:05.790 --> 21:07.170]  I'll show you the difference when we get another one.
[21:07.270 --> 21:07.430]  Cool.
[21:07.690 --> 21:09.990]  And then, uh, music to your ears.
[21:11.110 --> 21:11.470]  Bodrum.
[21:11.890 --> 21:12.150]  Okay.
[21:12.630 --> 21:12.990]  Alright.
[21:13.350 --> 21:13.950]  What the fuck?
[21:14.050 --> 21:14.630]  I think it's a drum.
[21:15.730 --> 21:16.090]  Ooh.
[21:16.270 --> 21:16.390]  Yeah.
[21:16.710 --> 21:17.330]  Oh, right.
[21:17.390 --> 21:18.090]  Yeah, it looks like a drum.
[21:18.870 --> 21:19.710]  Emily, are you okay?
[21:19.890 --> 21:20.310]  What do you need, babe?
[21:20.310 --> 21:21.450]  I need sleeves.
[21:21.590 --> 21:22.530]  I didn't prepare.
[21:23.130 --> 21:23.510]  Oh.
[21:23.650 --> 21:24.330]  Thank you.
[21:26.150 --> 21:26.530]  Ooh.
[21:26.770 --> 21:27.390]  That's pretty.
[21:27.530 --> 21:28.490]  2019 was a good year for these.
[21:28.710 --> 21:28.870]  What do we got?
[21:29.110 --> 21:29.530]  Rod Carew.
[21:29.710 --> 21:30.370]  Oh, that's cool.
[21:30.470 --> 21:31.190]  That's a real cool card.
[21:31.330 --> 21:32.490]  Here's Jonathan LeCroy.
[21:33.290 --> 21:36.790]  Our mini is gonna be, uh, Jake Arrieta.
[21:37.030 --> 21:38.070]  And you can see on...
[21:38.070 --> 21:38.370]  That's what the back's...
[21:38.370 --> 21:38.890]  Oh, it's got...
[21:38.890 --> 21:40.030]  Yeah, it's the regular back and...
[21:40.030 --> 21:41.450]  That's what the normal back looks like.
[21:41.850 --> 21:43.770]  This is what the Alan and Getter back...
[21:43.770 --> 21:44.050]  That's neat.
[21:44.050 --> 21:45.350]  They also have what's called Brooklyn backs.
[21:45.890 --> 21:49.770]  And then, uh, which I think the Brooklyn backs just have, like, little advertisements for old...
[21:50.430 --> 21:51.850]  Uh, different, like...
[21:51.850 --> 21:52.430]  Businesses?
[21:52.530 --> 21:52.610]  Yeah.
[21:52.710 --> 21:54.190]  No, or, like, cigarettes or, like, whatever.
[21:54.290 --> 21:55.450]  You know, old-age shit that they would have.
[21:55.810 --> 21:57.090]  And then, uh...
[21:57.090 --> 21:59.210]  And then there's also no numbered backs where there's no...
[21:59.210 --> 22:00.210]  It's the same card in the back.
[22:00.250 --> 22:00.890]  It just doesn't have a number.
[22:01.030 --> 22:01.130]  Yeah.
[22:01.250 --> 22:02.830]  That's a lot of little details you have to look out for.
[22:02.830 --> 22:03.030]  Somebody...
[22:03.030 --> 22:03.370]  There's a ton.
[22:03.510 --> 22:04.210]  Somebody in chat said,
[22:04.350 --> 22:05.290]  Sleeve the Derek Jeter,
[22:05.370 --> 22:06.930]  but I think maybe that's just their favorite player.
[22:07.030 --> 22:07.510]  Yeah, probably.
[22:08.330 --> 22:10.170]  Uh, here we have Carlos Santana.
[22:10.510 --> 22:10.690]  Hey!
[22:10.970 --> 22:12.230]  Jose Altuve.
[22:13.110 --> 22:15.090]  That's a hero right there for the Astros.
[22:15.290 --> 22:15.490]  Yeah, he is.
[22:16.510 --> 22:17.150]  Rick Porcello.
[22:17.830 --> 22:19.750]  What the fuck is this?
[22:19.750 --> 22:20.370]  What is it?
[22:20.590 --> 22:21.410]  I've never seen that.
[22:21.510 --> 22:22.230]  Oh, shit!
[22:22.510 --> 22:22.630]  Oh?
[22:22.890 --> 22:23.550]  I'll take that, too.
[22:24.010 --> 22:24.590]  Uh, here we...
[22:24.590 --> 22:26.150]  It's base, but there's a Pete Alonzo rookie.
[22:26.490 --> 22:26.690]  Oh.
[22:26.850 --> 22:27.410]  That's cool.
[22:27.670 --> 22:28.410]  19, I guess.
[22:28.550 --> 22:29.370]  I wonder where he's gonna go.
[22:29.450 --> 22:30.130]  Look at this.
[22:30.390 --> 22:30.710]  Wow.
[22:32.130 --> 22:34.870]  It is the history of flight.
[22:35.130 --> 22:36.250]  Space Shuttle Endeavor.
[22:36.370 --> 22:36.550]  Huh.
[22:36.630 --> 22:37.150]  That's pretty.
[22:37.490 --> 22:37.850]  That's neat.
[22:38.550 --> 22:39.470]  Full art card.
[22:39.590 --> 22:39.810]  They don't...
[22:39.810 --> 22:40.590]  Wow, that's really nice.
[22:40.610 --> 22:41.190]  That's really cool.
[22:41.270 --> 22:42.310]  I have to fuck around more with these.
[22:42.950 --> 22:43.950]  Let's open up one more of each.
[22:44.070 --> 22:44.810]  I like it.
[22:44.870 --> 22:44.950]  Cool.
[22:46.050 --> 22:46.870]  Also, what else are we gonna do?
[22:47.610 --> 22:48.550]  This is what we're here for, right?
[22:48.550 --> 22:49.530]  We're gonna open up this shit.
[22:49.690 --> 22:50.310]  Yeah, I mean, I...
[22:50.310 --> 22:50.550]  Yes.
[22:50.670 --> 22:51.210]  Get off my...
[22:51.210 --> 22:52.050]  Get off my nuts, all right?
[22:52.150 --> 22:54.130]  I'm not trying to do anything!
[22:54.570 --> 22:56.090]  I'm not on your nuts, man.
[22:56.510 --> 22:57.290]  Baby Ruth.
[22:57.850 --> 22:58.290]  Hey!
[22:58.470 --> 22:59.470]  Maybe he's behind the bat.
[22:59.550 --> 23:01.070]  Uh, Brandon Ninmo.
[23:01.810 --> 23:03.710]  We have Ari Chambers.
[23:04.130 --> 23:04.410]  Who's that?
[23:05.050 --> 23:05.970]  Oh, let's see.
[23:07.070 --> 23:07.510]  Um...
[23:07.510 --> 23:09.650]  Ari Chambers is a basketball reporter.
[23:09.890 --> 23:10.210]  Nice.
[23:10.810 --> 23:12.530]  Then we have...
[23:12.530 --> 23:14.410]  Oswaldo Cabrera rookie, base.
[23:14.470 --> 23:14.970]  That's cool.
[23:15.210 --> 23:16.450]  We already got this guy.
[23:16.590 --> 23:17.590]  Uh, this is the Vibes dude.
[23:17.810 --> 23:18.250]  Dogface.
[23:18.730 --> 23:19.450]  Oh, yeah.
[23:20.270 --> 23:21.310]  Oh, Steve Garvey.
[23:21.770 --> 23:25.010]  Is he about to run for, like, mayor or governor?
[23:25.210 --> 23:25.770]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[23:26.090 --> 23:26.450]  He's...
[23:26.450 --> 23:27.830]  Some office.
[23:27.930 --> 23:28.730]  I don't remember what it is.
[23:29.090 --> 23:29.290]  Yeah.
[23:29.390 --> 23:30.230]  He's trying to run for something.
[23:30.430 --> 23:31.270]  There's a...
[23:31.270 --> 23:33.470]  There's a, uh...
[23:33.470 --> 23:36.210]  A punk band that I used to listen to a lot called Angry Samoans.
[23:36.390 --> 23:37.330]  Yeah, I know Angry Samoans, yeah.
[23:37.490 --> 23:41.870]  They had a song called You Stupid Asshole, and it was about, in part, Steve Garvey.
[23:42.090 --> 23:42.390]  Really?
[23:42.550 --> 23:43.090]  Yeah, I believe so.
[23:43.390 --> 23:44.030]  That's awesome.
[23:45.390 --> 23:45.750]  Uh...
[23:45.750 --> 23:47.010]  We have a...
[23:47.630 --> 23:49.070]  Jeter Downs bass rookie.
[23:49.190 --> 23:51.130]  You can see he's just a normal one.
[23:52.050 --> 23:53.870]  And then, uh...
[23:54.470 --> 23:54.870]  Field...
[23:54.870 --> 23:55.950]  Oh, Reed Dettmer's inaccurate.
[23:56.450 --> 23:57.590]  Those are dogshit.
[23:58.070 --> 24:00.150]  Okay, let's see this 2019 pack again.
[24:00.350 --> 24:00.690]  Okay.
[24:00.810 --> 24:01.830]  We got Lucky with something fun there.
[24:01.970 --> 24:02.430]  I like it.
[24:02.890 --> 24:03.290]  Uh...
[24:03.290 --> 24:04.870]  We got Yasmani Grandal.
[24:05.070 --> 24:06.010]  We got Jacob de Grom.
[24:06.510 --> 24:06.970]  Is he gonna go?
[24:07.570 --> 24:09.130]  Are they clearing house with the...
[24:09.130 --> 24:11.110]  I don't know that they're clearing house, but...
[24:11.110 --> 24:12.070]  I mean, like...
[24:12.070 --> 24:12.410]  Yeah.
[24:13.250 --> 24:13.650]  Yes.
[24:13.810 --> 24:14.650]  Also, de Grom won.
[24:15.230 --> 24:15.810]  Did he leave?
[24:15.910 --> 24:16.250]  Where did he go?
[24:16.310 --> 24:17.010]  Yeah, didn't he...
[24:17.010 --> 24:17.610]  Didn't he go to the Rangers?
[24:17.850 --> 24:18.430]  I think you're right.
[24:18.570 --> 24:18.870]  I think you're right.
[24:18.870 --> 24:19.230]  I think he got Tommy John.
[24:19.450 --> 24:20.010]  Yeah, that's right.
[24:20.050 --> 24:20.410]  I think you're right.
[24:20.430 --> 24:22.710]  Which is crazy, because they're enforcing a game seven.
[24:23.470 --> 24:24.030]  Jose Ramirez.
[24:25.230 --> 24:25.510]  Uh...
[24:25.510 --> 24:26.650]  You Darvish.
[24:26.770 --> 24:27.210]  All right.
[24:27.270 --> 24:28.050]  That's his old team.
[24:28.250 --> 24:29.650]  Johnny Bench baseball sign.
[24:29.650 --> 24:30.550]  Oh, that's a cool card.
[24:30.610 --> 24:30.710]  That's cool.
[24:30.710 --> 24:31.630]  You know what I remembered is that...
[24:31.630 --> 24:32.430]  Baseball star signs.
[24:32.790 --> 24:33.290]  Yeah, that's cool.
[24:33.410 --> 24:33.690]  Sagittarius.
[24:33.830 --> 24:34.310]  You know what I remembered is that...
[24:34.310 --> 24:34.870]  We should collect them all.
[24:35.330 --> 24:39.710]  ...early on in one of our event break shows, we got a Johnny Bench auto.
[24:40.130 --> 24:40.310]  Really?
[24:40.310 --> 24:41.030]  Oh, did we?
[24:41.130 --> 24:41.850]  You got to look that up.
[24:42.310 --> 24:42.610]  Wow.
[24:42.710 --> 24:43.230]  I have that somewhere.
[24:43.350 --> 24:44.830]  I want to get all the signs.
[24:44.990 --> 24:45.530]  We will do that.
[24:45.990 --> 24:47.210]  That can be our next chase.
[24:47.290 --> 24:47.990]  We'll get all those signs.
[24:48.210 --> 24:48.590]  That's fun.
[24:49.550 --> 24:49.950]  Uh...
[24:49.950 --> 24:51.010]  Uenus Aspetus.
[24:51.810 --> 24:52.250]  Okay.
[24:53.470 --> 24:55.250]  We have Eddie Rosario.
[24:56.090 --> 24:57.810]  And then Ryan Yarbrough.
[24:57.970 --> 24:58.270]  Okay.
[24:58.490 --> 24:58.910]  Nice.
[24:59.250 --> 24:59.350]  That's fun.
[24:59.930 --> 25:03.410]  Let's open up some Pro Set Superstars music cards.
[25:03.410 --> 25:03.890]  I love it.
[25:04.130 --> 25:07.670]  Did you see the Dubai Baseball League that started and the draft went today?
[25:08.010 --> 25:08.150]  No.
[25:08.530 --> 25:10.030]  Didi Gregorius got drafted.
[25:10.250 --> 25:10.290]  Right.
[25:10.290 --> 25:12.030]  Robinson Cano got drafted.
[25:12.330 --> 25:13.950]  Bartolo Colon got drafted.
[25:14.210 --> 25:14.390]  Really?
[25:14.630 --> 25:15.990]  You said the Dubai?
[25:16.570 --> 25:18.830]  Pablo Sandoval got drafted.
[25:19.650 --> 25:20.730]  I don't know what that's talking about.
[25:21.270 --> 25:22.970]  It is the craziest.
[25:23.350 --> 25:26.750]  It's the fucking craziest thing I've ever seen.
[25:27.090 --> 25:29.750]  I'm so excited because it's going to suck.
[25:29.930 --> 25:30.190]  Yeah.
[25:30.190 --> 25:34.530]  But like watching Bartolo Colon pitch and he's 50 or 51.
[25:34.650 --> 25:34.930]  Yeah.
[25:35.410 --> 25:35.430]  Oh.
[25:36.370 --> 25:38.670]  Is this like the live version?
[25:38.850 --> 25:39.130]  Yes.
[25:39.210 --> 25:39.390]  Yeah.
[25:39.410 --> 25:39.550]  Yeah.
[25:39.550 --> 25:39.710]  Yeah.
[25:39.710 --> 25:40.270]  They're trying to do that.
[25:40.270 --> 25:41.310]  But it's not old people?
[25:41.850 --> 25:41.930]  No.
[25:42.190 --> 25:43.730]  It's not supposed to be.
[25:43.830 --> 25:43.930]  Oh.
[25:44.070 --> 25:49.110]  That's just, you know, you got to get star power so you get Robinson Cano to play second
[25:49.110 --> 25:49.590]  base.
[25:51.910 --> 25:54.270]  John Crook's hanging up his sportscaster.
[25:55.310 --> 25:56.050]  Do you think Miggy's going there?
[25:57.030 --> 25:57.690]  Fucking maybe.
[25:58.170 --> 25:58.910]  Who knows?
[25:59.250 --> 26:00.650]  I mean, give him enough money.
[26:00.810 --> 26:01.250]  Why not?
[26:01.390 --> 26:01.810]  Why not?
[26:01.970 --> 26:03.050]  That's what they're trying to do, so why not?
[26:03.070 --> 26:03.790]  Paula Abdul.
[26:04.170 --> 26:05.270]  I'll be sure.
[26:05.430 --> 26:06.030]  I love these.
[26:06.990 --> 26:07.390]  Savatage.
[26:07.670 --> 26:09.270]  I don't say sabotage.
[26:09.330 --> 26:10.250]  I say sabotage.
[26:10.250 --> 26:10.970]  Savatage.
[26:11.830 --> 26:13.310]  The Chrissy Hynde and the Pretenders.
[26:13.910 --> 26:15.170]  Never knew what they were pretending about.
[26:15.970 --> 26:16.770]  Perfect Gentleman.
[26:16.890 --> 26:18.410]  Oh, they do look like little gentlemen.
[26:18.750 --> 26:20.330]  Ooh, Paul Young.
[26:20.470 --> 26:21.130]  Didn't even look young.
[26:21.370 --> 26:23.010]  That looks like the guy from Saved by the Bell.
[26:23.470 --> 26:24.210]  It does kind of, huh?
[26:24.630 --> 26:25.270]  The Cult.
[26:25.790 --> 26:26.110]  Nice.
[26:26.250 --> 26:27.290]  A friend that liked them way too much.
[26:27.410 --> 26:27.950]  Really? Gus?
[26:29.030 --> 26:30.390]  No, it was another friend that was weird.
[26:31.030 --> 26:32.030]  LL Cool J.
[26:32.310 --> 26:32.710]  Baby.
[26:33.750 --> 26:35.710]  Here we have historic concerts.
[26:35.870 --> 26:37.570]  B.B. King and Santana.
[26:37.650 --> 26:38.110]  At the Fillmore.
[26:38.310 --> 26:38.670]  Nice.
[26:38.670 --> 26:41.070]  Then we also have another historic concert.
[26:41.250 --> 26:43.910]  This is Jimi Hendrix and whoever that is.
[26:43.970 --> 26:44.490]  I think we have that card.
[26:44.930 --> 26:45.570]  Do we really?
[26:45.690 --> 26:46.370]  I think so.
[26:46.550 --> 26:47.910]  John Maxhall.
[26:49.090 --> 26:49.990]  I don't know, whoever he is.
[26:50.010 --> 26:51.350]  He's not fucking Jimi Hendrix.
[26:52.610 --> 26:53.330]  All right.
[26:53.450 --> 26:54.410]  What do we do now?
[26:54.550 --> 26:55.190]  What are you feeling?
[26:55.810 --> 26:57.190]  We got plenty of stuff.
[26:57.370 --> 26:58.210]  What have you been itching to open?
[26:58.230 --> 26:59.750]  Hey, NFL's happening, right?
[26:59.810 --> 27:00.010]  Yeah.
[27:00.070 --> 27:04.190]  Let's open up this hanger of NFL mosaics.
[27:04.270 --> 27:04.930]  Is this this year?
[27:05.190 --> 27:05.850]  Yeah, I believe so.
[27:05.930 --> 27:06.270]  Nice.
[27:07.330 --> 27:09.130]  This is what I showed off last week.
[27:09.250 --> 27:10.870]  I pulled a Genesis Parallel.
[27:11.110 --> 27:11.510]  Oh, that's cool.
[27:12.510 --> 27:13.050]  One of these.
[27:13.150 --> 27:16.670]  Looking for a Travis Kelce on-card auto, so my wife will be impressed.
[27:16.990 --> 27:17.310]  Oh!
[27:18.390 --> 27:19.130]  That'd be good.
[27:19.390 --> 27:22.750]  Let's get you a Travis Kelce on-card auto.
[27:22.890 --> 27:23.750]  My wife will love it.
[27:23.790 --> 27:24.990]  And your swifty wife.
[27:25.610 --> 27:28.370]  I want the coach of the Tigers.
[27:28.770 --> 27:29.330]  No, Lions.
[27:30.290 --> 27:30.850]  Oh, okay.
[27:31.230 --> 27:31.970]  You want Dan Campbell?
[27:32.310 --> 27:32.570]  Yeah.
[27:32.750 --> 27:32.950]  Okay.
[27:33.090 --> 27:33.510]  I like him.
[27:33.510 --> 27:38.510]  Zach Cunningham, Akeem Hicks, Larry Johnson.
[27:39.650 --> 27:42.510]  Tom Brady doesn't still play for the Patriots.
[27:42.650 --> 27:43.450]  No, it's been a while.
[27:43.730 --> 27:46.590]  Javon Kersey, Kenny Holiday.
[27:47.170 --> 27:50.370]  Speaking of doesn't still play, here's a silver parallel Ray Lewis.
[27:50.570 --> 27:50.930]  Nice.
[27:51.090 --> 27:51.530]  Fun fact.
[27:52.130 --> 27:52.970]  He didn't do it.
[27:53.050 --> 27:54.590]  He wasn't there and he doesn't know what you're talking about.
[27:54.670 --> 27:54.910]  Okay.
[27:55.630 --> 27:56.270]  Nevermind then.
[27:57.030 --> 27:58.210]  What happened to him?
[27:58.770 --> 27:59.290]  Nothing!
[27:59.850 --> 28:01.070]  What allegedly happened?
[28:01.150 --> 28:02.410]  Nothing happened to him.
[28:02.970 --> 28:04.330]  It's what happened to the other person.
[28:05.630 --> 28:05.990]  Oh.
[28:06.270 --> 28:07.990]  Deshaun Watson, touchdown master.
[28:08.230 --> 28:09.050]  Not this week, he wasn't.
[28:09.190 --> 28:09.470]  Why is he?
[28:09.530 --> 28:10.430]  You got a fucking big head?
[28:10.570 --> 28:11.630]  Yeah, these are big head cards.
[28:11.790 --> 28:12.390]  They're all big heads.
[28:12.650 --> 28:13.130]  What the fuck?
[28:13.270 --> 28:14.790]  They have an NBA too.
[28:15.290 --> 28:17.230]  I love them because they're so goofy.
[28:18.390 --> 28:23.170]  Quentin Nelson, Orange, Blast, Parallel, Baker Mayfield.
[28:24.570 --> 28:27.090]  Boy, he just keeps getting chances, huh?
[28:27.490 --> 28:28.430]  DJ Moore.
[28:31.070 --> 28:31.850]  Getting a lot of those.
[28:32.410 --> 28:33.230]  What are they called?
[28:33.410 --> 28:34.150]  Orange Blast?
[28:34.270 --> 28:35.490]  It's like Orange Blast, I think.
[28:36.150 --> 28:36.770]  Devonta Smith.
[28:37.330 --> 28:37.870]  That's nice.
[28:38.070 --> 28:40.250]  Oh, these are last year's cards if that's a Devonta Smith rookie.
[28:41.370 --> 28:42.210]  Jared Goff.
[28:44.030 --> 28:44.870]  Patrick Mahomes.
[28:45.390 --> 28:46.570]  He plays with Travis Kelsey.
[28:46.750 --> 28:47.310]  Tommy Trimble.
[28:47.490 --> 28:49.570]  Oh yeah, he's the other guy on the team.
[28:49.950 --> 28:50.550]  JC Horn.
[28:51.030 --> 28:53.390]  Oh shit, there's a nice little Trevor Lawrence-based rookie.
[28:53.830 --> 28:56.750]  I did not think that he would be the one that would...
[28:56.750 --> 28:57.970]  Who would have thought?
[28:58.130 --> 28:58.610]  What would we have?
[28:58.710 --> 28:59.530]  We had Zach Wilson.
[28:59.770 --> 29:00.950]  We had Trey Lance.
[29:00.950 --> 29:04.410]  We had Mac Jones.
[29:05.090 --> 29:07.350]  Especially in Jacksonville.
[29:07.550 --> 29:08.350]  Especially in Jacksonville.
[29:08.370 --> 29:12.730]  Who would have thought that he would have had any targets to hit in any kind of performance there?
[29:12.930 --> 29:13.310]  It's crazy.
[29:13.550 --> 29:13.710]  Insane.
[29:13.850 --> 29:14.190]  It's crazy.
[29:14.370 --> 29:15.470]  Rashad Bateman rookie.
[29:16.290 --> 29:16.830]  There we go.
[29:17.010 --> 29:17.310]  Alright.
[29:17.570 --> 29:18.490]  Alright, that was a good little pack.
[29:18.610 --> 29:19.530]  No Travis Kelsey's.
[29:19.610 --> 29:20.810]  No, that's okay though.
[29:21.650 --> 29:23.350]  That's okay because we have this year's, I was wrong.
[29:23.570 --> 29:23.730]  Yeah!
[29:27.190 --> 29:27.930]  Open more.
[29:27.930 --> 29:30.750]  So those were called Orange Blast Cards, but it's not like a Cracked Ice.
[29:30.930 --> 29:31.890]  Cracked Ice is like a different thing.
[29:32.110 --> 29:33.190]  Cracked Ice is a Cracked Eye.
[29:33.310 --> 29:34.410]  You know what they'll tell me on here.
[29:34.530 --> 29:35.170]  Where did I put...
[29:35.170 --> 29:37.450]  Are we doing Andrew Pan on Cracked Ice?
[29:38.750 --> 29:39.710]  Are we gonna show it off?
[29:40.110 --> 29:41.150]  I don't have it.
[29:41.950 --> 29:42.450]  I don't have it.
[29:42.590 --> 29:42.710]  I don't have it.
[29:42.710 --> 29:43.150]  I don't have it.
[29:43.410 --> 29:45.470]  They were called Reactive Orange.
[29:48.050 --> 29:51.330]  Tony slipped us something earlier to show off.
[29:51.330 --> 29:55.770]  And they might be getting slipped in with the Slop-O-Clock clock.
[29:56.210 --> 29:56.850]  When does that come out?
[29:56.850 --> 29:58.850]  What's Tony gonna do, get mad?
[29:59.030 --> 30:00.030]  Is Tony gonna get angry at us?
[30:00.570 --> 30:07.050]  You know when we released the second round of Gerplers, we put collectible Gerpel cards in there?
[30:07.090 --> 30:07.190]  Yeah.
[30:07.270 --> 30:12.250]  Well, we may just have a whole set of collectible cards.
[30:12.350 --> 30:20.030]  Yeah, and we may be starting with the Pantin Balaclava look.
[30:20.250 --> 30:20.470]  Yeah.
[30:22.530 --> 30:26.110]  A base card Cracked Gerpel?
[30:26.110 --> 30:27.070]  Cracked Gerpel.
[30:27.170 --> 30:27.610]  Yeah.
[30:27.610 --> 30:28.370]  Cracked Gerpel.
[30:28.930 --> 30:29.610]  Gerpel Ice.
[30:29.830 --> 30:31.910]  And then what, gold stamped? Foil stamped?
[30:32.070 --> 30:33.070]  Yeah, there was a foil stamp.
[30:33.230 --> 30:34.370]  Dude, fucking wild.
[30:34.570 --> 30:34.970]  Pretty wild.
[30:35.450 --> 30:36.990]  That'll be, I think November...
[30:36.990 --> 30:37.330]  God.
[30:38.250 --> 30:42.130]  I have to talk to you about when we have time, because I think not this coming...
[30:42.650 --> 30:47.750]  Not next Monday, but the Monday after, I think that's when we're doing Dirt Pens.
[30:48.710 --> 30:49.770]  Oh, we have to do Dirt Pens.
[30:49.790 --> 30:54.290]  Yeah, and then I think that's when the Slop-O-Clock clock is gonna...
[30:54.290 --> 30:55.170]  We're trying to go on sale.
[30:55.170 --> 30:57.230]  Oh shit, we got a lot going on.
[30:57.270 --> 30:58.330]  Yeah, there's gonna be a lot going on.
[30:58.450 --> 31:05.230]  So, we'll have more information at BuckfacePod on Instagram and on Twitter and a subreddit we don't run.
[31:06.030 --> 31:07.650]  Justin Fields, that was another one.
[31:08.610 --> 31:09.490]  All right, here we go.
[31:09.570 --> 31:09.970]  Here we go.
[31:10.310 --> 31:11.250]  Damien Pierce.
[31:13.250 --> 31:14.210]  AJ Brown.
[31:16.110 --> 31:19.230]  Josh Downs, NFL debut rookie, we'll save that.
[31:20.910 --> 31:22.370]  DJ Johnson rookie.
[31:22.850 --> 31:23.070]  Wow.
[31:23.070 --> 31:25.330]  That looks like a variant, but I don't think it is.
[31:25.450 --> 31:25.710]  Whoa.
[31:26.190 --> 31:26.770]  Is it?
[31:26.990 --> 31:28.110]  It's just a really shiny card.
[31:28.450 --> 31:34.010]  No, I think that might be a variant card, because it's not a prism, but it is a prism on the back.
[31:34.130 --> 31:34.490]  See that?
[31:34.950 --> 31:36.050]  It means it's a prism.
[31:36.790 --> 31:37.910]  What's different about it?
[31:38.330 --> 31:38.790]  I don't know.
[31:38.850 --> 31:43.750]  Sometimes you get a mosaic, or sometimes you get a prism that's mis-prism, like mis-marked.
[31:43.830 --> 31:44.110]  How weird.
[31:44.150 --> 31:45.550]  But I think this is probably a variant.
[31:45.550 --> 31:54.090]  He looks like in paintings when they symbolize some blowing air, you know, like winter's coming or something.
[31:54.930 --> 31:55.870]  Yeah, I know what you mean.
[31:56.330 --> 31:59.110]  Mike Evans, Blue Reactive, I guess is what they call it.
[31:59.870 --> 32:00.670]  Phil Sims.
[32:02.010 --> 32:02.590]  Who's that?
[32:02.850 --> 32:04.270]  A guy that retired 15 years ago.
[32:06.110 --> 32:07.210]  Teddy Brushy, bang.
[32:07.350 --> 32:07.970]  That's a cool card.
[32:08.710 --> 32:08.810]  Yeah.
[32:09.090 --> 32:10.590]  It's just a neat... I'm sorry, guys.
[32:10.770 --> 32:14.670]  Teddy Brushy broke his neck and then kept playing, and I think he got popped for steroids once.
[32:14.670 --> 32:16.370]  He had worms.
[32:17.730 --> 32:19.390]  Teddy Brushy got worms.
[32:19.850 --> 32:20.450]  Fred Taylor.
[32:22.010 --> 32:22.790]  Kenneth Walker.
[32:23.490 --> 32:23.930]  All right.
[32:25.410 --> 32:29.110]  Ooh, Zachary Charbonnet, Silver Prism Rookie.
[32:29.330 --> 32:30.150]  That's nice.
[32:30.430 --> 32:31.090]  That is nice.
[32:31.250 --> 32:31.910]  We'll see that.
[32:32.170 --> 32:33.230]  Eric, do you know a lot about football?
[32:33.890 --> 32:40.550]  Yeah, I mean, I know a lot about football, but like when we start getting into Kenneth Walker III, it's like a little lost on me, you know what I mean?
[32:40.670 --> 32:42.110]  Boy, do I have a gift for you.
[32:42.170 --> 32:42.850]  Oh, yeah, let's see.
[32:42.850 --> 32:46.770]  How about a touchdown match for Travis Kelce-Biggins?
[32:48.150 --> 32:49.570]  Give this right to you.
[32:50.270 --> 32:51.010]  Wow, my wife.
[32:51.230 --> 32:52.130]  She'll look at it.
[32:52.770 --> 32:53.950]  She won't know what to do with it.
[32:54.370 --> 32:56.830]  Is it, like, double sleep it, or is it good?
[32:57.130 --> 32:58.730]  Maybe we should sell it to the Swifties.
[32:58.890 --> 32:59.650]  That's a good idea.
[32:59.810 --> 33:00.690]  That's what...
[33:00.690 --> 33:01.250]  That's...
[33:01.250 --> 33:02.590]  You let your wife know that came from us.
[33:02.730 --> 33:02.890]  Yeah.
[33:03.510 --> 33:04.370]  Tyler, it's your birthday present.
[33:05.450 --> 33:06.330]  Happy birthday.
[33:10.330 --> 33:12.670]  Holding a bust of Emmett Smith.
[33:12.790 --> 33:14.050]  Oh, that's awesome.
[33:14.770 --> 33:14.930]  That's a Smith on Smith.
[33:14.930 --> 33:15.470]  Smith on Smith.
[33:16.250 --> 33:16.830]  That's a crime.
[33:20.290 --> 33:22.850]  Here we have Jay Ward.
[33:23.270 --> 33:26.130]  What's with all the rookies in their, like, skimpy clothes?
[33:26.250 --> 33:26.930]  They don't have...
[33:26.930 --> 33:27.510]  Sexy little poses.
[33:27.550 --> 33:29.630]  Well, they don't have a jersey to play in yet.
[33:30.210 --> 33:30.610]  I mean...
[33:30.610 --> 33:31.350]  They don't usually...
[33:31.350 --> 33:32.470]  Little teases, huh?
[33:32.470 --> 33:33.570]  Alan Page.
[33:35.750 --> 33:36.210]  Uh...
[33:36.210 --> 33:36.950]  Ruklan Smith.
[33:37.110 --> 33:37.530]  Bang!
[33:37.830 --> 33:38.070]  Bang.
[33:38.930 --> 33:39.690]  Deshaun Watson.
[33:39.950 --> 33:40.550]  He's doing great.
[33:40.790 --> 33:41.350]  Mike Williams.
[33:41.930 --> 33:42.730]  He's not doing great.
[33:42.950 --> 33:43.130]  Oh.
[33:43.470 --> 33:44.290]  What's his problem?
[33:44.730 --> 33:45.150]  Uh...
[33:45.150 --> 33:46.070]  Well, he's got a lot of problems.
[33:46.550 --> 33:47.650]  He has a lot of problems.
[33:48.330 --> 33:49.470]  His problem is he shouldn't...
[33:51.030 --> 33:51.710]  He shouldn't...
[33:52.230 --> 33:53.450]  He shouldn't get massages.
[33:53.850 --> 33:54.310]  Oh.
[33:54.750 --> 33:56.770]  Oh, he's the one that they moved around?
[33:57.030 --> 33:58.190]  He's the NFL one.
[33:58.430 --> 33:59.410]  There was an NBA one, too.
[33:59.530 --> 34:01.030]  Who was the one they moved around, though?
[34:01.030 --> 34:03.050]  He moved from Houston up to...
[34:03.050 --> 34:05.070]  They gave him the old Catholic priest treatment.
[34:05.370 --> 34:06.210]  Yeah, the old...
[34:06.210 --> 34:07.150]  Fresh start in Cleveland.
[34:07.570 --> 34:07.670]  Yeah.
[34:08.390 --> 34:09.190]  Peter Veya.
[34:09.530 --> 34:11.170]  There's so much to do there to keep them busy, you know?
[34:11.190 --> 34:12.030]  Jerry Rice Eleve.
[34:12.230 --> 34:13.130]  It's the land.
[34:13.330 --> 34:13.470]  Yeah.
[34:13.730 --> 34:14.470]  Chris Olave.
[34:15.930 --> 34:17.690]  Fucking Broadway Joe Namath.
[34:17.750 --> 34:18.110]  Wow.
[34:18.290 --> 34:18.550]  Hey.
[34:19.110 --> 34:20.450]  Eric Dickerson Thunder Lane.
[34:20.570 --> 34:20.750]  Cool.
[34:21.230 --> 34:21.390]  Okay.
[34:21.490 --> 34:21.810]  Nice.
[34:22.110 --> 34:23.050]  Two more of these packs, though.
[34:23.310 --> 34:27.990]  No matter how many catches he snags, Kelsey is a threat to score whenever he gets the ball.
[34:28.690 --> 34:29.390]  Tommy Pham solo.
[34:29.610 --> 34:29.750]  Watch out.
[34:29.750 --> 34:30.850]  Oh, is the game already started?
[34:31.090 --> 34:31.710]  The NLCS.
[34:31.790 --> 34:32.150]  D-backs game?
[34:32.430 --> 34:32.510]  Yeah.
[34:32.810 --> 34:33.430]  Desmond Ritter.
[34:33.910 --> 34:36.350]  I think the Phillies just need to win one more.
[34:36.630 --> 34:37.130]  Yeah, they do.
[34:38.510 --> 34:39.690]  Oh, Jalen Hurts.
[34:39.810 --> 34:40.470]  National pride.
[34:40.810 --> 34:41.070]  All right.
[34:41.210 --> 34:43.090]  I'm sad to see the Eagles win Sunday.
[34:43.370 --> 34:44.370]  Tyler Scott.
[34:45.130 --> 34:46.110]  Ventral Miller.
[34:46.670 --> 34:47.990]  Look at his little legs.
[34:48.210 --> 34:48.470]  See?
[34:48.650 --> 34:50.230]  It's all like little juicy booty.
[34:50.350 --> 34:50.630]  Yeah.
[34:51.050 --> 34:52.210]  Teddy Brushy.
[34:53.630 --> 34:54.630]  Stephon Diggs.
[34:54.770 --> 34:55.350]  Epic performer.
[34:55.930 --> 34:56.930]  Epic performer.
[34:59.750 --> 35:01.150]  Who's your favorite NFL team?
[35:01.590 --> 35:02.250]  Red Zones.
[35:02.330 --> 35:03.350]  I don't have a favorite NFL team.
[35:03.390 --> 35:05.790]  Remember, he's butthurt about San Diego.
[35:05.790 --> 35:06.230]  Oh, right.
[35:06.370 --> 35:07.190]  I don't have a team.
[35:07.310 --> 35:07.550]  They left.
[35:07.650 --> 35:08.430]  They went to L.A.
[35:08.430 --> 35:09.890]  No one gives a fuck about them in L.A.
[35:10.210 --> 35:11.390]  Tony Romo.
[35:11.990 --> 35:12.970]  He dated Jessica Simpson.
[35:13.230 --> 35:14.310]  Darren Waller.
[35:14.610 --> 35:14.830]  He did.
[35:15.790 --> 35:17.410]  To my knowledge, did not date Jessica Simpson.
[35:17.430 --> 35:17.750]  It's true.
[35:17.770 --> 35:18.130]  Eddie Jordan.
[35:18.130 --> 35:18.670]  To your knowledge.
[35:18.850 --> 35:20.670]  To my knowledge, did not date Jessica Simpson.
[35:21.770 --> 35:22.490]  Justin Herbert.
[35:22.990 --> 35:23.710]  National pride.
[35:23.870 --> 35:25.390]  Didn't look so proud last night.
[35:25.410 --> 35:26.910]  And he's playing for the team that you like.
[35:26.910 --> 35:27.590]  Pretty cool.
[35:27.970 --> 35:29.230]  I mean, I watch Chargers games.
[35:29.330 --> 35:30.110]  I love watching them lose.
[35:30.330 --> 35:31.130]  Brian Urlacher.
[35:32.070 --> 35:33.810]  That dude was so big, dude.
[35:33.970 --> 35:34.610]  Yeah, he was a big dude.
[35:34.970 --> 35:35.590]  Hines Ward.
[35:36.530 --> 35:36.850]  I...
[35:36.850 --> 35:37.850]  You met him.
[35:37.930 --> 35:38.410]  I met him.
[35:38.430 --> 35:39.450]  You ran out on the field with him.
[35:39.470 --> 35:39.610]  Kind of.
[35:39.750 --> 35:41.570]  I got to stand next to him and run out on the field.
[35:41.610 --> 35:44.330]  He's the coach of the San Antonio Brahmas.
[35:45.030 --> 35:47.490]  And I was a big Hines Ward fan when I was younger.
[35:47.830 --> 35:48.970]  And that was a cool moment for me.
[35:49.010 --> 35:50.450]  Did we eat so many hot dogs that day?
[35:50.550 --> 35:52.010]  We did eat a lot of hot dogs that day.
[35:52.130 --> 35:54.230]  And you ran so well.
[35:54.250 --> 35:54.990]  Prism Silver.
[35:55.250 --> 35:56.550]  Full of hot dogs running hard.
[35:56.550 --> 35:57.610]  You ran.
[35:58.370 --> 36:00.550]  That's where Eric got to see your military...
[36:01.370 --> 36:01.750]  My Mickey Mantle gene.
[36:02.030 --> 36:06.030]  Where you walked in the National Anthem played and it was immediately like...
[36:06.590 --> 36:08.290]  It's like programming kicked in.
[36:08.350 --> 36:09.110]  There's nothing I can do about that.
[36:10.250 --> 36:12.330]  I thought an eagle was going to fly over.
[36:13.630 --> 36:14.930]  No, that was just the creature.
[36:16.450 --> 36:18.690]  I love the San Antonio creature.
[36:19.010 --> 36:19.570]  DeWitzer Glider.
[36:20.690 --> 36:20.890]  What?
[36:21.530 --> 36:21.930]  Ooh.
[36:22.410 --> 36:24.670]  Is that the one that we saw in...
[36:24.670 --> 36:25.750]  Is that the Wright Brothers?
[36:27.050 --> 36:29.490]  It was first successfully manned aircraft in the world.
[36:29.610 --> 36:31.510]  It was built by German engineer Otto Lilly.
[36:31.730 --> 36:34.250]  See, that goes against all of everything I learned about America.
[36:34.570 --> 36:35.390]  That's a fake news.
[36:35.530 --> 36:35.950]  Fake news.
[36:36.130 --> 36:36.250]  Fake news.
[36:37.690 --> 36:38.850]  That's not at the Ford Museum.
[36:38.910 --> 36:39.810]  We did a telephone.
[36:41.070 --> 36:41.870]  Aubrey Beardsley.
[36:42.210 --> 36:42.750]  Oh, that's pretty.
[36:43.250 --> 36:44.090]  Yeah, we invented that.
[36:44.110 --> 36:44.830]  Yeah, we drew it.
[36:44.830 --> 36:45.090]  America.
[36:46.090 --> 36:46.890]  Brooklyn Bridge.
[36:46.990 --> 36:47.650]  I remember when I built that.
[36:47.650 --> 36:49.970]  Only one of those in Brooklyn, America.
[36:50.190 --> 36:51.550]  I walked the elephant across it.
[36:51.730 --> 36:52.570]  Eiffel Tower.
[36:52.970 --> 36:54.250]  That was really cool when you made that.
[36:54.470 --> 36:54.870]  Boo!
[36:56.010 --> 36:56.450]  Boo!
[36:57.210 --> 36:57.610]  I can't.
[36:57.890 --> 36:58.630]  Eiffel Tower was pretty cool.
[36:59.250 --> 37:00.690]  I haven't seen it.
[37:02.410 --> 37:03.750]  I haven't seen it in person.
[37:03.890 --> 37:04.670]  Oh my God, it's the same.
[37:05.250 --> 37:05.810]  Now you have.
[37:06.510 --> 37:06.950]  Wow.
[37:08.150 --> 37:08.990]  John Sullivan.
[37:09.690 --> 37:11.350]  That's my kind of guy right there.
[37:11.850 --> 37:12.130]  Dude.
[37:12.530 --> 37:14.130]  That's him going to the wrestling shows.
[37:14.250 --> 37:14.790]  How about you?
[37:15.410 --> 37:16.990]  He's just poured into that outfit.
[37:17.470 --> 37:18.030]  Let's see.
[37:18.570 --> 37:19.890]  I think it's just pants.
[37:20.030 --> 37:22.310]  Do you guys know what his nickname was?
[37:23.110 --> 37:23.750]  Tough guy.
[37:23.750 --> 37:24.790]  I'll say Iron Hands.
[37:24.930 --> 37:27.250]  He lived from 1858 to 1918.
[37:27.670 --> 37:29.870]  His nickname was the Boston Strong Boy.
[37:30.170 --> 37:35.890]  He was the first boxing superstar and one of the highest paid athletes of his time.
[37:36.050 --> 37:38.310]  He made six pence a fight.
[37:39.790 --> 37:41.210]  Boston Strong Boy.
[37:42.030 --> 37:43.130]  That's what his mom called him.
[37:43.130 --> 37:46.250]  We didn't invent creativity until the 40s or 50s, I think.
[37:46.410 --> 37:47.890]  Oh my God.
[37:48.030 --> 37:48.210]  What?
[37:48.530 --> 37:49.270]  What you got?
[37:49.430 --> 37:50.090]  Oh my God.
[37:50.090 --> 37:50.590]  Lay it down, baby.
[37:50.690 --> 37:51.030]  Let's go.
[37:51.030 --> 37:56.430]  Best known for the Kill Rain fight, the last bare knuckle heavyweight title fight.
[37:56.430 --> 37:56.630]  Yeah.
[37:56.850 --> 38:00.790]  One of the first sporting events in the U.S. to receive national press coverage.
[38:01.170 --> 38:03.850]  The Kill Rain fight was held in a secret location.
[38:04.390 --> 38:05.710]  Richburg, Mississippi, by the way.
[38:06.430 --> 38:06.850]  Not so secret.
[38:07.410 --> 38:12.150]  On July 8, 1889, he won after 75 rounds.
[38:13.210 --> 38:18.590]  Anything, any secret fight that happens in Mississippi is never good.
[38:18.730 --> 38:19.090]  No.
[38:20.190 --> 38:22.310]  But 75 rounds, Jesus.
[38:22.450 --> 38:23.290]  You know who's from Mississippi?
[38:24.830 --> 38:26.210]  My entire family.
[38:26.630 --> 38:33.010]  My family migrated to Alabama to escape Mississippi.
[38:33.410 --> 38:34.570]  I was going to say my friend Andrew.
[38:35.110 --> 38:35.810]  He's from Mississippi.
[38:35.850 --> 38:37.990]  My friend Lindsey's from Mississippi.
[38:38.330 --> 38:38.850]  Yeah, that's true.
[38:39.490 --> 38:40.590]  Ox... what is it?
[38:40.610 --> 38:40.950]  Oxnard?
[38:41.130 --> 38:41.450]  I don't know.
[38:41.850 --> 38:42.650]  Robber barons.
[38:42.910 --> 38:43.510]  Got a lot of them.
[38:44.410 --> 38:45.270]  Good housekeeping.
[38:45.730 --> 38:46.030]  That's me.
[38:46.050 --> 38:46.870]  Gotta keep a good house.
[38:47.310 --> 38:48.610]  I did the dishes this morning.
[38:48.610 --> 38:49.870]  I did them this morning.
[38:50.010 --> 38:50.790]  You did not.
[38:51.050 --> 38:51.970]  I did them this morning.
[38:52.250 --> 38:53.450]  I emptied the dishwasher, dude.
[38:53.530 --> 38:55.190]  No, you did not.
[38:55.250 --> 38:56.090]  You emptied it?
[38:56.310 --> 38:56.790]  Did we run it?
[38:57.410 --> 38:58.090]  Oh, my God.
[38:58.250 --> 39:01.190]  No, remember when I said there's a full bowl of cereal in here?
[39:01.530 --> 39:03.170]  I was like, I gotta go to Emma.
[39:03.530 --> 39:05.270]  That was after I had already emptied the dishwasher.
[39:06.450 --> 39:07.910]  And then I did two loads of laundry.
[39:08.070 --> 39:08.550]  Your laundry.
[39:08.710 --> 39:09.930]  I hung up all of your clothes.
[39:10.150 --> 39:10.990]  Mark Twain.
[39:11.430 --> 39:12.790]  Do your clothes not get hung up otherwise?
[39:13.310 --> 39:15.410]  No, because I like to iron them and then I'll hang them up.
[39:15.670 --> 39:17.070]  Triangle shirtwaist fire.
[39:17.330 --> 39:17.930]  Oh, no.
[39:18.370 --> 39:20.710]  That's my Roman Empire.
[39:20.770 --> 39:22.310]  That is Roman Empire.
[39:22.390 --> 39:23.090]  I need that.
[39:23.210 --> 39:24.090]  Emily's Roman Empire.
[39:24.130 --> 39:24.770]  Ah, yes.
[39:24.850 --> 39:25.690]  You wanna talk about it?
[39:26.650 --> 39:26.870]  No!
[39:28.210 --> 39:32.170]  It's a lot about, like, women working and they, like, lock the doors.
[39:32.950 --> 39:33.670]  Locking us in.
[39:33.750 --> 39:38.250]  It was the first thing that, like, set us up for, like, I don't know, making sure we don't burn alive.
[39:38.290 --> 39:39.130]  Because there was a fire.
[39:39.250 --> 39:40.050]  It was a textile thing.
[39:40.130 --> 39:41.530]  Could have been a lot of witches in that place.
[39:41.530 --> 39:41.910]  You don't know.
[39:42.090 --> 39:43.650]  Shit, well, we weren't on our brooms, so.
[39:43.810 --> 39:45.230]  Brie Silver, stay away, Eric.
[39:45.330 --> 39:45.990]  Oh, Eric.
[39:45.990 --> 39:47.730]  Peter Rabbit, Beatrix Potter.
[39:48.930 --> 39:49.330]  Krakatoa.
[39:50.210 --> 39:50.610]  What?
[39:51.350 --> 39:52.910]  This is the weirdest pack.
[39:53.190 --> 39:55.030]  Oh, here's, uh, do you guys remember you can't do that on television?
[39:55.170 --> 39:55.330]  Yeah.
[39:55.830 --> 39:56.230]  Nickelodeon.
[39:56.590 --> 39:57.270]  Oh, that's different.
[39:57.410 --> 39:57.830]  Oh, that's cool.
[39:58.570 --> 40:00.950]  Here's the Fisk Jubilee Singers.
[40:01.750 --> 40:03.770]  Here is Pullman Porters.
[40:04.750 --> 40:06.170]  Is that a person or is that a thing?
[40:07.130 --> 40:07.370]  It's a place.
[40:07.810 --> 40:08.050]  Oh.
[40:08.690 --> 40:09.010]  Oh.
[40:09.270 --> 40:09.650]  What?
[40:09.950 --> 40:10.310]  Uh-oh.
[40:10.470 --> 40:11.050]  Are we allowed to show it?
[40:11.070 --> 40:11.270]  Yeah, yeah.
[40:12.850 --> 40:13.250]  Uh...
[40:13.990 --> 40:14.390]  Velocipede.
[40:15.690 --> 40:16.090]  Velocipede?
[40:16.090 --> 40:17.270]  That sounds like a bike car.
[40:17.330 --> 40:17.930]  Do you like bikes?
[40:18.330 --> 40:18.830]  I do like bikes.
[40:18.830 --> 40:19.650]  It's like a centipede?
[40:20.110 --> 40:20.350]  Yeah.
[40:20.630 --> 40:22.130]  It's a centipede, but on bicycles.
[40:22.310 --> 40:22.530]  Wow.
[40:22.750 --> 40:23.630]  But it won't sting you.
[40:23.690 --> 40:24.290]  Pendleton Act.
[40:25.310 --> 40:26.690]  If you ever wanted to read the Pendleton Act.
[40:26.790 --> 40:27.270]  I don't.
[40:28.070 --> 40:28.790]  Cuban Giants.
[40:29.390 --> 40:29.770]  Oh, cool.
[40:29.910 --> 40:30.970]  And Winston Churchill.
[40:31.330 --> 40:31.590]  Yeah.
[40:31.830 --> 40:32.770]  We got two more packs of this.
[40:33.070 --> 40:34.890]  You know, this box is never gonna go away.
[40:35.090 --> 40:36.870]  I feel like we've been opening these packs for years.
[40:36.910 --> 40:39.730]  We're supposed to get some sort of a relic or an autograph.
[40:39.790 --> 40:40.710]  I don't think we've ever got it.
[40:40.810 --> 40:42.070]  Or we have, I don't think we've gotten it yet.
[40:43.090 --> 40:43.450]  Uh...
[40:43.450 --> 40:44.030]  Dorit's...
[40:44.030 --> 40:44.610]  They're a glider again.
[40:44.610 --> 40:45.630]  Someone said it's a glider.
[40:45.710 --> 40:48.050]  We didn't invent the glider, we invented the airplane.
[40:48.270 --> 40:49.370]  Someone in chat said it was different.
[40:49.590 --> 40:50.510]  No, we invented that, too.
[40:50.650 --> 40:52.510]  I mean, I invented everything, so...
[40:52.510 --> 40:54.550]  William Morris, he invented lung cancer.
[40:54.890 --> 40:55.010]  What?
[40:55.930 --> 40:56.370]  Uh...
[40:56.370 --> 40:56.990]  Didn't he?
[40:57.410 --> 40:59.630]  Wasn't William Morris at Bank?
[41:00.830 --> 41:01.270]  Uh...
[41:01.270 --> 41:01.670]  Insurance?
[41:02.250 --> 41:03.670]  I thought he was, uh, cigarettes.
[41:04.330 --> 41:04.590]  Either one.
[41:04.590 --> 41:04.990]  Oh!
[41:05.190 --> 41:06.310]  So Arthur Conan Doyle.
[41:07.030 --> 41:08.170]  He invented mysteries.
[41:09.130 --> 41:09.570]  Uh...
[41:09.570 --> 41:10.750]  North and South Dakota.
[41:11.090 --> 41:12.110]  There's the line, too.
[41:12.530 --> 41:13.090]  Yeah, that's true.
[41:13.570 --> 41:13.990]  Uh...
[41:13.990 --> 41:14.890]  They invented the Badlands.
[41:15.070 --> 41:15.350]  Mm-hmm.
[41:15.750 --> 41:16.990]  John Joseph Montgomery.
[41:17.290 --> 41:19.110]  Oh, yeah, he invented the bicycle airplane.
[41:19.910 --> 41:20.330]  American.
[41:20.610 --> 41:21.350]  That we did, yeah.
[41:21.890 --> 41:23.050]  Victorian pinup girls.
[41:23.210 --> 41:23.610]  That was...
[41:23.610 --> 41:24.470]  Ooh-la-la.
[41:24.510 --> 41:25.970]  We invented the sex symbol.
[41:26.190 --> 41:26.790]  What the fuck?
[41:26.910 --> 41:27.130]  Mm-hmm.
[41:27.550 --> 41:28.330]  Ooh-la-la.
[41:28.850 --> 41:32.050]  It's just such a bummer to, like, live in those times and be like, that's it, that's
[41:32.050 --> 41:32.530]  all we got.
[41:33.130 --> 41:34.610]  They're like, look at her arm.
[41:34.670 --> 41:35.990]  It's like, you start beating off.
[41:36.290 --> 41:36.570]  Yeah.
[41:36.650 --> 41:37.990]  Uh, Arm & Hammer Soda.
[41:38.810 --> 41:39.230]  Hey.
[41:39.330 --> 41:40.170]  Charles Guitier.
[41:41.190 --> 41:41.450]  Boom.
[41:41.730 --> 41:42.810]  Oh, John Philip Sousa.
[41:43.370 --> 41:43.730]  Nice.
[41:43.970 --> 41:45.630]  And then Winslow Homer.
[41:46.070 --> 41:46.430]  Captain of the Titanic.
[41:46.430 --> 41:47.890]  He, uh, he invented paintings.
[41:48.710 --> 41:49.070]  Simpsons.
[41:50.110 --> 41:50.470]  Of...
[41:50.470 --> 41:51.730]  Wasn't Homer the Odyssey?
[41:52.550 --> 41:53.250]  Yeah, it's a different guy.
[41:53.270 --> 41:54.570]  Maybe that's him going with the science.
[41:54.630 --> 41:55.970]  Winslow Homer was a painter.
[41:56.530 --> 41:56.910]  I don't know.
[41:57.290 --> 41:58.170]  I don't know what any of these guys are.
[41:58.170 --> 42:01.230]  Winslow Homer was a painter who painted in Key West sometimes, and when we, and Bernie
[42:01.230 --> 42:05.490]  was very excited to go see Key West Winslow Homer paintings at the museum, and then they
[42:05.490 --> 42:05.870]  didn't have any.
[42:06.330 --> 42:06.710]  Oh, that's right.
[42:06.750 --> 42:08.210]  He went, and he was bummed.
[42:08.330 --> 42:08.530]  Yeah.
[42:08.650 --> 42:09.610]  He was super bummed.
[42:09.730 --> 42:10.150]  That was funny.
[42:10.430 --> 42:11.210]  Alexander Graham Bell.
[42:11.210 --> 42:12.010]  Those are...
[42:12.010 --> 42:12.550]  We invented the telephone.
[42:12.550 --> 42:12.930]  That's copywritten.
[42:13.170 --> 42:14.070]  You can't take that.
[42:14.490 --> 42:15.430]  Jacob Rills.
[42:15.630 --> 42:17.330]  He invented sleeping in a...
[42:17.330 --> 42:17.630]  Children.
[42:18.210 --> 42:18.650]  Children.
[42:19.130 --> 42:22.630]  Every time you flip this over to read what the card is, it seems like you get bummed
[42:22.630 --> 42:22.830]  out.
[42:23.070 --> 42:23.430]  Journalist.
[42:23.570 --> 42:23.730]  Yeah.
[42:24.770 --> 42:25.850]  Standard time zones.
[42:25.930 --> 42:26.910]  Well, the past was dark.
[42:27.070 --> 42:27.670]  We invented that.
[42:28.150 --> 42:28.970]  Thomas Eakins.
[42:29.030 --> 42:30.010]  What do we think he did?
[42:30.710 --> 42:31.150]  He...
[42:31.150 --> 42:32.230]  Well, I can't see.
[42:32.530 --> 42:35.730]  He was a Philadelphia-area painter, sculptor, and photographer and teacher.
[42:36.270 --> 42:36.910]  He's an artist.
[42:37.590 --> 42:38.030]  Boo!
[42:38.530 --> 42:38.970]  Boo!
[42:39.190 --> 42:40.290]  Evelyn Nesbitt.
[42:41.490 --> 42:42.290]  She invented...
[42:42.290 --> 42:43.050]  Look at her!
[42:43.230 --> 42:43.670]  I can't.
[42:43.690 --> 42:44.970]  She's like, look at these little teats.
[42:45.150 --> 42:45.570]  I'm about to get married.
[42:46.230 --> 42:47.090]  Dr. Pepper.
[42:47.530 --> 42:47.930]  Nice!
[42:48.050 --> 42:48.570]  That's what's up.
[42:48.670 --> 42:49.350]  Waco's original.
[42:49.930 --> 42:50.730]  Thomas Nast.
[42:51.190 --> 42:52.210]  What do you think Thomas Nast did?
[42:52.470 --> 42:53.050]  It'd be nasty.
[42:53.050 --> 42:53.850]  He looks nasty.
[42:53.990 --> 42:54.890]  He looks nasty.
[42:55.790 --> 42:58.270]  I think he's credited with getting nasty for the first time.
[42:59.430 --> 43:01.610]  He's the father of political cartoons, so kind of right.
[43:02.910 --> 43:04.170]  There's old Coxsey's Army.
[43:04.670 --> 43:05.150]  And then...
[43:05.150 --> 43:06.750]  Oh, we got a lenticular card.
[43:07.490 --> 43:07.890]  Then...
[43:07.890 --> 43:08.450]  Oh, that's cool.
[43:08.450 --> 43:12.030]  Mansions of Fifth Avenue, Henry F. St. Clair House.
[43:12.190 --> 43:17.190]  That looks like the house in Gilded Age on HBO that is coming back for season two.
[43:17.350 --> 43:19.190]  That's what it looks like then.
[43:19.790 --> 43:20.910]  That's what it looks like now.
[43:21.450 --> 43:21.850]  Then...
[43:21.850 --> 43:22.390]  Now.
[43:22.550 --> 43:22.750]  Yeah.
[43:24.550 --> 43:24.950]  Then...
[43:24.950 --> 43:25.250]  Now.
[43:25.610 --> 43:26.630]  Good work.
[43:27.030 --> 43:27.270]  Thank you.
[43:27.450 --> 43:27.650]  Thank you.
[43:28.030 --> 43:29.090]  Enough of those for another week.
[43:29.170 --> 43:29.510]  Let's do it.
[43:29.670 --> 43:31.010]  Someday we're going to get the fucking...
[43:31.010 --> 43:31.730]  Whatever the hit is.
[43:31.790 --> 43:31.970]  Yep.
[43:33.250 --> 43:33.850]  Oh, yeah.
[43:33.870 --> 43:34.430]  I want to do this.
[43:35.110 --> 43:36.770]  So, you know, Emily...
[43:38.250 --> 43:41.510]  My dear love is obsessed with Little Hasbulla.
[43:41.670 --> 43:42.070]  Oh, that's right.
[43:42.230 --> 43:44.290]  And so we've been trying to get a little Hasbulla autograph.
[43:44.750 --> 43:45.470]  My little short king.
[43:45.730 --> 43:46.230]  Yeah, your short king.
[43:46.350 --> 43:47.190]  So I got some more...
[43:47.190 --> 43:48.210]  I think it was a fast break.
[43:48.550 --> 43:49.730]  Do you think I should sell it when I get it?
[43:49.730 --> 43:50.830]  There is one autograph in here.
[43:50.910 --> 43:52.750]  No, I don't think you'll be able to do that.
[43:53.070 --> 43:54.310]  But do you think that his, like...
[43:54.310 --> 43:56.710]  Depends on what it is and how much you need the money.
[43:56.830 --> 43:57.450]  You want to go to UFC when it's...
[43:57.450 --> 43:58.310]  It would help pay for the wedding.
[43:58.490 --> 43:59.150]  When it's in Austin?
[43:59.470 --> 43:59.990]  Yeah, I do.
[44:00.230 --> 44:00.290]  When is it?
[44:00.290 --> 44:00.510]  Yeah.
[44:00.930 --> 44:02.070]  Like beginning of December, I think?
[44:02.210 --> 44:02.610]  Hell yeah.
[44:02.750 --> 44:03.410]  Israel Adesanya.
[44:04.010 --> 44:04.690]  Hey, we saw him.
[44:04.690 --> 44:06.550]  I asked Gavin if he would go.
[44:07.030 --> 44:08.130]  And he said...
[44:08.530 --> 44:08.930]  Yeah.
[44:09.530 --> 44:09.990]  I'll go.
[44:10.150 --> 44:10.830]  I would love to go.
[44:10.990 --> 44:11.590]  I would have gone anyway.
[44:11.590 --> 44:12.030]  I think it would be a lot of fun.
[44:13.370 --> 44:13.770]  Imov...
[44:13.770 --> 44:14.570]  It was just during...
[44:14.570 --> 44:16.050]  I think we were recording the other day and you weren't there.
[44:16.290 --> 44:17.210]  Anthony Smith.
[44:18.050 --> 44:19.250]  Bo Nickel rookie.
[44:20.150 --> 44:20.850]  Let's leave that.
[44:21.930 --> 44:22.730]  Amanda Rebus.
[44:23.210 --> 44:23.430]  Wow.
[44:23.510 --> 44:24.330]  Jamal Hill.
[44:24.670 --> 44:24.870]  Cool.
[44:25.090 --> 44:26.350]  Matt Hughes.
[44:27.570 --> 44:28.370]  Curtis Blades.
[44:28.510 --> 44:28.790]  Too tall.
[44:29.530 --> 44:29.930]  And...
[44:29.930 --> 44:32.190]  Magomed Ankalev.
[44:32.950 --> 44:33.710]  Those are...
[44:33.710 --> 44:34.530]  Where is it that they're on?
[44:36.330 --> 44:36.770]  Dagestan.
[44:36.770 --> 44:38.990]  They all have the chin strap here.
[44:39.110 --> 44:39.550]  Yeah, and the hat.
[44:39.850 --> 44:41.130]  I think it's probably a religious thing.
[44:41.210 --> 44:41.490]  But yeah.
[44:41.650 --> 44:43.190]  Those dudes from Dagestan are tough motherfuckers.
[44:43.610 --> 44:43.710]  Yeah.
[44:43.970 --> 44:44.970]  They are...
[44:45.490 --> 44:46.470]  Rule the UFC.
[44:48.950 --> 44:49.390]  Jerry...
[44:49.390 --> 44:51.890]  Jerry Prokazaka.
[44:53.590 --> 44:54.470]  Aaron Blanchfield.
[44:55.670 --> 44:56.550]  Pat Sabatini.
[44:56.830 --> 44:57.110]  Rookie.
[44:57.650 --> 44:58.730]  Let's leave that.
[44:58.930 --> 44:59.670]  Oh, this is rookie too.
[44:59.850 --> 45:01.510]  I don't know why we're bothering, but...
[45:02.010 --> 45:02.890]  Jack Hermanson.
[45:06.010 --> 45:06.650]  Jose Nunez.
[45:06.770 --> 45:07.950]  Holly Holm.
[45:08.150 --> 45:10.010]  Ended the career...
[45:10.010 --> 45:10.050]  Why?
[45:10.510 --> 45:13.930]  Oh, she beat the unbeatable Ronda Rousey, and then that was pretty much it for her.
[45:13.950 --> 45:14.550]  And that was...
[45:14.550 --> 45:15.890]  Yeah, she did it, and that was it.
[45:16.030 --> 45:16.630]  She went out on top.
[45:17.610 --> 45:18.250]  Bo Nickel.
[45:18.710 --> 45:19.030]  Fearless.
[45:19.470 --> 45:19.790]  Parallel.
[45:20.130 --> 45:20.310]  Wow.
[45:20.470 --> 45:21.330]  And then...
[45:21.330 --> 45:22.150]  Oh, this is funny.
[45:22.950 --> 45:23.510]  We got an auto.
[45:23.630 --> 45:24.250]  We got our auto already.
[45:24.250 --> 45:24.430]  Okay.
[45:24.630 --> 45:24.830]  Okay.
[45:25.750 --> 45:28.870]  It's not quite Hasbulla, but it is Tito Ortiz!
[45:29.070 --> 45:29.390]  Dang!
[45:31.510 --> 45:32.150]  Oh, boy!
[45:32.390 --> 45:32.870]  Tito Ortiz.
[45:32.870 --> 45:33.190]  Tito Ortiz.
[45:33.390 --> 45:36.410]  Huntington Beach, uh, councilman, I think.
[45:36.590 --> 45:36.730]  Wow.
[45:36.730 --> 45:38.210]  And, uh, famed idiot.
[45:38.530 --> 45:39.150]  Still, uh...
[45:39.150 --> 45:40.430]  Is he still married to Jenna Jameson?
[45:40.510 --> 45:40.870]  No.
[45:41.170 --> 45:41.690]  I don't think so.
[45:41.790 --> 45:42.030]  No.
[45:42.130 --> 45:43.310]  They got a divorce a while ago.
[45:43.610 --> 45:45.310]  Famed moron, Tito Ortiz.
[45:45.470 --> 45:46.610]  Yeah, Andrew loves him.
[45:46.710 --> 45:47.070]  Big Tito Ortiz.
[45:47.210 --> 45:47.570]  Really?
[45:47.870 --> 45:47.970]  Yeah.
[45:48.230 --> 45:48.650]  What's his...
[45:48.650 --> 45:51.030]  Because he's a M-O-R-O-N.
[45:51.170 --> 45:51.330]  Yeah.
[45:51.330 --> 45:51.810]  And Eric said...
[45:51.810 --> 45:52.750]  I didn't say that to Tito Ortiz.
[45:53.070 --> 45:53.630]  He's a maroon.
[45:53.910 --> 45:54.610]  He's a maroon.
[45:54.750 --> 45:55.910]  He's Huntington Beach's finest.
[45:55.910 --> 45:58.210]  Hey, in a few minutes, we're gonna open this baseball bat that's signed.
[45:58.530 --> 45:59.210]  Yeah, we'll find out.
[45:59.210 --> 46:00.350]  It's probably gonna be a show...
[46:00.350 --> 46:00.530]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:00.530 --> 46:01.190]  I'm excited about.
[46:01.270 --> 46:01.910]  Steven Thompson.
[46:02.150 --> 46:02.450]  Mm-hmm.
[46:02.770 --> 46:04.150]  Uh, Nikita Krylov.
[46:04.330 --> 46:04.530]  Cool.
[46:05.290 --> 46:06.250]  Marcin Tybura.
[46:07.570 --> 46:08.530]  Leon Edwards.
[46:09.230 --> 46:10.550]  Molly McCann, rookie.
[46:11.170 --> 46:11.310]  Get it.
[46:11.330 --> 46:12.990]  Andrej Petrovski, rookie.
[46:14.090 --> 46:14.990]  Tesha Torres.
[46:17.170 --> 46:18.530]  Uh, Michael Morales.
[46:19.110 --> 46:20.250]  Ooh, Derek Lewis.
[46:21.010 --> 46:21.330]  Whoa.
[46:21.430 --> 46:21.730]  That's a cool one.
[46:21.810 --> 46:22.550]  We saw him fight.
[46:22.630 --> 46:23.830]  Yeah, we've seen him fight a few times.
[46:24.130 --> 46:25.750]  He, uh...
[46:25.750 --> 46:27.830]  Yeah, his nickname is the Black Beast.
[46:28.030 --> 46:28.290]  Dang.
[46:28.290 --> 46:28.650]  Damn.
[46:29.010 --> 46:29.790]  He's pretty cool.
[46:29.990 --> 46:31.250]  Uh, so we're gonna see those.
[46:31.370 --> 46:33.530]  I just realized I haven't opened up any basketball yet.
[46:33.670 --> 46:34.130]  No, you haven't.
[46:34.130 --> 46:35.490]  That's probably why I'm itching a little bit.
[46:35.530 --> 46:36.250]  I'm not feeling...
[46:36.250 --> 46:36.790]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:36.810 --> 46:38.110]  That's why you're itching, yeah.
[46:39.230 --> 46:39.590]  Uh...
[46:39.590 --> 46:42.310]  He's getting the DTs for not opening basketball cards.
[46:42.310 --> 46:42.790]  I need it.
[46:42.830 --> 46:45.370]  It's the only cards I'm gonna allow myself to open between now and next Monday.
[46:45.370 --> 46:46.330]  Marc is smart.
[46:46.490 --> 46:47.750]  Where are you?
[46:49.770 --> 46:50.510]  I need it.
[46:50.510 --> 46:50.910]  That's you.
[46:51.150 --> 46:52.250]  It's really sad.
[46:52.430 --> 46:54.230]  That's him at night when he's just playing.
[46:54.290 --> 46:55.470]  He's just caressing his cards.
[46:55.710 --> 46:55.870]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:55.950 --> 46:56.990]  And, uh, I'll be honest...
[46:56.990 --> 46:57.970]  He pauses trucks.
[46:58.090 --> 46:58.370]  I've been...
[46:58.370 --> 46:59.330]  That's when he touches the cards.
[46:59.470 --> 46:59.610]  Yeah.
[46:59.770 --> 47:02.350]  I've been kind of numb to it until very recently.
[47:02.490 --> 47:03.570]  It's really started to sink in.
[47:03.770 --> 47:05.090]  Basketball starts, like, tomorrow, doesn't it?
[47:05.190 --> 47:05.490]  Yeah.
[47:05.890 --> 47:06.330]  Yeah.
[47:06.910 --> 47:08.870]  My teams don't play until Wednesday, but, yeah.
[47:09.270 --> 47:09.750]  Who's your teams?
[47:10.110 --> 47:11.650]  Well, I gotta support Memphis now.
[47:11.650 --> 47:12.010]  Uh-oh.
[47:12.150 --> 47:12.630]  Marc is smart.
[47:13.330 --> 47:14.210]  Quentin Grimes.
[47:14.390 --> 47:15.290]  Tamara Rosen.
[47:15.570 --> 47:16.990]  Aaron Nesmith, ex-Celtic.
[47:17.450 --> 47:18.950]  Will Barton, silver parallel.
[47:19.690 --> 47:22.670]  Kemba Walker, pink-cracked ice, ex-Celtic.
[47:22.970 --> 47:24.850]  PJ Washington, pink-cracked ice.
[47:25.550 --> 47:26.970]  Andrew Wiggins, global reach.
[47:26.970 --> 47:27.550]  He's Canadian.
[47:27.790 --> 47:28.550]  That's global, I guess.
[47:28.970 --> 47:30.330]  Jaden Hardy, base rookie.
[47:30.750 --> 47:33.370]  Gary Payton, OG Gary Payton.
[47:33.430 --> 47:34.170]  That's a Supersonics.
[47:35.270 --> 47:38.310]  His son plays for Golden State again.
[47:38.490 --> 47:40.170]  He did, then he left, and I think he came back.
[47:40.970 --> 47:41.290]  I don't know.
[47:41.750 --> 47:42.610]  That should be still there.
[47:42.670 --> 47:43.650]  Call him San Francisco now.
[47:43.970 --> 47:44.710]  Sorry, San Francisco.
[47:45.770 --> 47:47.830]  Chris Duarte, second-year card.
[47:48.490 --> 47:49.450]  Austin Rivers.
[47:49.750 --> 47:50.190]  Okay.
[47:50.610 --> 47:53.150]  Not currently on the team, but he is podcasting a lot.
[47:53.230 --> 47:53.770]  All right.
[47:53.870 --> 47:54.470]  What's he...
[47:54.470 --> 47:55.010]  Just as good.
[47:55.010 --> 47:55.330]  What's he talking about?
[47:55.490 --> 47:55.890]  Baseball?
[47:56.370 --> 47:56.810]  Or basketball?
[47:57.230 --> 47:58.130]  Yeah, he's talking about basketball.
[47:58.210 --> 47:58.750]  He's talking about baseball.
[47:59.970 --> 48:01.690]  Hey, I'm learning about this other sport.
[48:02.570 --> 48:03.490]  Lyndell Carter, Jr.
[48:04.050 --> 48:05.050]  Terry Rozier, the third.
[48:05.170 --> 48:07.070]  Scary Terry, ex-Celtic again.
[48:07.350 --> 48:08.010]  Bryce McGowan's...
[48:08.610 --> 48:09.690]  That was in the same photo.
[48:09.850 --> 48:10.170]  ...pink-cracked ice.
[48:10.970 --> 48:11.310]  Ooh.
[48:11.890 --> 48:12.670]  She got what she got.
[48:12.810 --> 48:13.050]  She got what she got.
[48:13.150 --> 48:13.610]  Oh, oh, oh.
[48:13.750 --> 48:15.110]  Ty-Ty Washington, emergent.
[48:15.130 --> 48:15.390]  Hey.
[48:15.770 --> 48:17.010]  Dougie Buckets.
[48:17.170 --> 48:17.430]  Uh-huh.
[48:18.050 --> 48:19.430]  Marjahn Beauchamp, base rookie.
[48:19.710 --> 48:23.550]  And then Jason Tatum, silver prism.
[48:24.110 --> 48:24.510]  Oh.
[48:25.810 --> 48:26.490]  That's a good...
[48:26.490 --> 48:27.290]  Oh, boy.
[48:27.450 --> 48:28.290]  That's a good ten bucks.
[48:28.390 --> 48:29.190]  Easy right there.
[48:29.330 --> 48:29.530]  Nice.
[48:29.670 --> 48:30.310]  Maybe a little bit more.
[48:30.470 --> 48:30.830]  Is it...
[48:30.830 --> 48:32.390]  It seems like it's cut fairly well.
[48:32.650 --> 48:33.070]  That might...
[48:33.070 --> 48:33.970]  That might ten out.
[48:34.310 --> 48:36.430]  What's the word on the street about Tatum this year?
[48:36.550 --> 48:38.850]  That he's angry and gonna fucking destroy the rest of the NBA.
[48:39.070 --> 48:39.790]  Oh, for real?
[48:39.990 --> 48:40.230]  Yeah.
[48:40.590 --> 48:41.110]  Hell yeah.
[48:41.230 --> 48:42.210]  That's the word I'm putting out.
[48:42.410 --> 48:42.750]  Oh.
[48:43.050 --> 48:43.550]  Right now.
[48:44.250 --> 48:44.930]  That's how I feel.
[48:44.930 --> 48:45.550]  I like that.
[48:45.770 --> 48:47.030]  That's what I've heard about Ben Simmons.
[48:48.150 --> 48:50.290]  Ben Simmons is definitely saying that about Ben Simmons.
[48:50.790 --> 48:52.550]  No, I'm really...
[48:52.550 --> 48:53.770]  Ben Simmons has been...
[48:53.770 --> 48:54.030]  There's...
[48:54.030 --> 48:58.390]  According to rumors spread by Ben Simmons, Ben Simmons is ready to dominate the league.
[48:58.610 --> 49:01.530]  He's ready to pass the ball to someone to score.
[49:02.330 --> 49:04.830]  I'm really, really, really...
[49:04.830 --> 49:06.950]  I really believe in the Celtics this year.
[49:07.030 --> 49:07.190]  Yeah?
[49:07.250 --> 49:09.030]  I think they look good.
[49:09.290 --> 49:09.450]  I think...
[49:09.450 --> 49:11.310]  I'm ready for Ben Simmons to get a triple single every night.
[49:11.390 --> 49:11.790]  It's gonna be sick.
[49:12.230 --> 49:12.850]  Seth Curry.
[49:13.990 --> 49:14.830]  PJ Tucker.
[49:15.130 --> 49:15.230]  Yeah.
[49:15.790 --> 49:16.430]  Seth Curry.
[49:16.510 --> 49:17.130]  Think about Seth Curry.
[49:17.470 --> 49:20.830]  He actually has a higher career three-point percentage than his brother.
[49:21.030 --> 49:21.290]  Really?
[49:21.290 --> 49:22.050]  Did you...
[49:22.050 --> 49:26.490]  Remember when we were watching Webanyama play against Steph Curry?
[49:26.670 --> 49:27.070]  Yes.
[49:27.190 --> 49:27.630]  That's pretty funny.
[49:27.830 --> 49:28.830]  Steph Curry did not wear a shirt.
[49:29.590 --> 49:30.210]  Jalen Green.
[49:30.590 --> 49:33.230]  Webanyama's gonna change the NBA in one day.
[49:33.250 --> 49:34.370]  Yeah, because it's...
[49:34.370 --> 49:37.390]  Okay, we're all gonna pull up from downtown and just put it up.
[49:37.810 --> 49:38.910]  You can't shoot...
[49:38.910 --> 49:39.470]  You're here.
[49:39.630 --> 49:41.530]  You can't just shoot over a wall.
[49:41.610 --> 49:42.650]  He's gonna lead the...
[49:42.650 --> 49:45.310]  He's gonna lead the league in blocks in his rookie year.
[49:45.330 --> 49:46.510]  I feel pretty safe in saying.
[49:46.550 --> 49:46.610]  And he's not...
[49:46.610 --> 49:48.190]  And he's not going to be...
[49:48.190 --> 49:50.230]  It's just gonna be his hands up.
[49:50.230 --> 49:51.850]  And he's going to make it happen.
[49:52.210 --> 49:55.250]  I watched a video yesterday of him, his workout routine.
[49:55.590 --> 49:58.410]  I've seen a bunch, but I watched a video yesterday where he was doing the splits.
[49:58.650 --> 49:58.810]  Yeah.
[49:59.190 --> 50:00.010]  That's fucking crazy.
[50:00.150 --> 50:01.330]  That dude is so flexible.
[50:02.130 --> 50:03.230]  He's incredibly flexible.
[50:03.270 --> 50:05.230]  He's putting on a little bit of muscle.
[50:05.790 --> 50:06.710]  I'm excited to watch him.
[50:07.090 --> 50:12.690]  Man, everything that's coming out now that he's in the Wizards is just that he was insufferable.
[50:12.730 --> 50:12.990]  Yes.
[50:13.110 --> 50:13.370]  Really?
[50:13.590 --> 50:14.370]  Yeah, nothing...
[50:14.370 --> 50:15.730]  I've heard nothing positive.
[50:16.170 --> 50:16.970]  Anthony Edwards dominance.
[50:17.250 --> 50:19.010]  He's my pick to be the future face of the NBA.
[50:19.010 --> 50:20.250]  Oh, yeah, we were talking about that.
[50:20.330 --> 50:21.810]  TaiTai Washington, base rookie.
[50:22.890 --> 50:23.190]  TaiTai?
[50:23.350 --> 50:23.750]  TaiTai.
[50:24.010 --> 50:24.470]  That's me.
[50:24.470 --> 50:24.890]  That's what I am.
[50:25.110 --> 50:25.950]  That's me most nights.
[50:26.170 --> 50:26.570]  TaiTai.
[50:26.630 --> 50:27.010]  TaiTai.
[50:27.430 --> 50:29.350]  I had a late night in trucks last night.
[50:29.770 --> 50:30.390]  Very TaiTai.
[50:31.390 --> 50:32.190]  What were you going to say, Emily?
[50:32.430 --> 50:33.350]  What is the...
[50:33.350 --> 50:34.550]  What do they say about Jordan Poole?
[50:34.650 --> 50:36.130]  They say that he's just unlikable?
[50:36.370 --> 50:37.690]  Or he would, like, start problems?
[50:38.150 --> 50:38.850]  Bad attitude.
[50:39.350 --> 50:40.470]  Not a team player.
[50:41.190 --> 50:46.970]  Disrespectful to the, you know, four-time NBA champ teammates that he worked for.
[50:47.410 --> 50:49.610]  He's the guy who Draymond Green punched out.
[50:49.850 --> 50:50.810]  Oh, right.
[50:50.990 --> 50:51.270]  Okay.
[50:51.630 --> 50:52.350]  It was pretty exciting.
[50:53.810 --> 50:55.110]  Bojan Bogdanovic, which...
[50:55.110 --> 50:57.270]  Do you think that's why they let him get away with it?
[50:57.370 --> 50:58.470]  Because they're like, I mean...
[50:58.470 --> 50:59.130]  Well, yeah, yes.
[50:59.230 --> 50:59.890]  Because you have to...
[50:59.890 --> 51:00.090]  Yeah.
[51:00.550 --> 51:01.570]  I think so, honestly.
[51:01.630 --> 51:02.210]  That's so funny.
[51:02.590 --> 51:04.550]  JB, he's going to have a great year, too.
[51:04.710 --> 51:06.090]  We'll just leave that as we do all these things.
[51:06.110 --> 51:06.450]  I bet he's angry.
[51:06.570 --> 51:08.130]  Jimmy Butler, not going to have a great year.
[51:08.550 --> 51:08.870]  Why?
[51:09.590 --> 51:11.890]  Because his team didn't get any better.
[51:12.010 --> 51:14.210]  If he can get to, like, the playoffs, then, you know, whatever.
[51:14.270 --> 51:15.210]  He can go off, but...
[51:15.210 --> 51:15.770]  I like him.
[51:15.770 --> 51:16.110]  We'll see.
[51:16.290 --> 51:16.610]  Yeah, me too.
[51:16.690 --> 51:17.170]  It's so weird.
[51:17.230 --> 51:17.970]  I like Jimmy Butler.
[51:18.910 --> 51:19.630]  I actually...
[51:19.630 --> 51:20.350]  I really...
[51:20.350 --> 51:21.150]  I like Pat Riley.
[51:21.410 --> 51:23.030]  I like...
[51:23.850 --> 51:24.210]  Uh...
[51:24.590 --> 51:25.990]  Everything about the Heat, but the Heat.
[51:26.110 --> 51:26.190]  Yeah.
[51:26.190 --> 51:27.150]  I really don't know how else to describe it.
[51:27.150 --> 51:28.930]  It's just weird that he's, like, not...
[51:29.590 --> 51:31.130]  I don't know, vibing with his team.
[51:31.270 --> 51:31.390]  Yeah.
[51:31.390 --> 51:34.650]  But everybody, every big player wants to go play for his team.
[51:35.330 --> 51:35.690]  Oh, yeah.
[51:35.690 --> 51:37.270]  Like, whether McCarty wants to go, where...
[51:37.270 --> 51:38.950]  Well, they only want to go there because it's Miami.
[51:39.090 --> 51:39.250]  Yeah.
[51:39.250 --> 51:43.450]  Yeah, but it's like, you'd think that they would let these big players come in to make...
[51:43.450 --> 51:44.770]  Well, it's...
[51:44.770 --> 51:45.290]  They just...
[51:45.290 --> 51:45.750]  It's about giving up.
[51:45.770 --> 51:47.310]  You have to give up a lot to get a guy like that.
[51:47.450 --> 51:48.350]  You gotta give to get.
[51:48.490 --> 51:49.510]  And they just don't have...
[51:49.510 --> 51:51.090]  They have a lot of deprecated assets.
[51:51.370 --> 51:52.330]  They're not...
[51:52.330 --> 51:53.850]  They don't have the depth to do that stuff.
[51:54.190 --> 51:58.910]  According to Logan Murdoch, Draymond Green reportedly refused to go to dinner with Jordan
[51:58.910 --> 51:59.230]  Poole.
[51:59.490 --> 52:03.850]  According to Warriors officials, head coach Steve Kerr made several attempts to convince
[52:03.850 --> 52:08.210]  Green to take Poole to dinner to smooth over the relationship, but Green declined.
[52:08.390 --> 52:08.530]  Yeah.
[52:08.750 --> 52:10.990]  I don't like Draymond Green at all, but I'm with him on this one.
[52:11.030 --> 52:13.370]  I love Draymond Green.
[52:14.790 --> 52:15.510]  Ex-Celtic.
[52:16.110 --> 52:19.090]  Bojan Bogdanovic just twisted away in Detroit.
[52:19.190 --> 52:19.670]  It makes no sense.
[52:19.730 --> 52:22.070]  He could be such a contributor on a contender right now.
[52:22.150 --> 52:22.330]  I don't get it.
[52:22.710 --> 52:23.370]  They won't let him go.
[52:23.530 --> 52:23.690]  Nope.
[52:23.810 --> 52:25.690]  They could flip him for some really good assets right now.
[52:27.190 --> 52:27.910]  Oh, nice.
[52:28.090 --> 52:28.990]  Scottie Pippen Jr.
[52:29.210 --> 52:29.570]  Silver.
[52:30.490 --> 52:33.850]  I've gotten a bunch of Scottie Pippen Jr. rookies that are all pretty good.
[52:35.190 --> 52:38.210]  Johnny Davis, Emergent, Vince Williams Jr. rookie.
[52:38.270 --> 52:38.990]  Two more packs.
[52:39.130 --> 52:39.570]  We got...
[52:39.570 --> 52:40.450]  We have to open this...
[52:40.450 --> 52:41.790]  We gotta open this baseball bat soon.
[52:41.830 --> 52:43.110]  We might have to do one pack, man.
[52:43.110 --> 52:43.910]  This might be...
[52:43.910 --> 52:44.590]  No, no, no.
[52:44.650 --> 52:45.570]  What if you do a speed run?
[52:45.670 --> 52:46.490]  I'm gonna open them fast.
[52:46.670 --> 52:46.950]  Look at this.
[52:49.430 --> 52:50.430]  I'll do it fast.
[52:50.590 --> 52:52.550]  I won't tell any stories or any fun stuff at all.
[52:53.210 --> 52:53.590]  Yeah, right.
[52:54.810 --> 52:55.170]  Ah!
[52:55.670 --> 52:57.910]  Hey, don't tell any stories.
[52:58.170 --> 52:59.050]  No fun stuff.
[53:00.130 --> 53:00.730]  All right.
[53:02.570 --> 53:03.290]  Josh Getty.
[53:04.090 --> 53:04.450]  Stop.
[53:04.550 --> 53:05.050]  Kevin Hart.
[53:05.650 --> 53:06.010]  What?
[53:06.170 --> 53:06.830]  I don't know.
[53:06.990 --> 53:07.610]  Terrence Mann.
[53:07.750 --> 53:08.350]  Silver Prism.
[53:08.590 --> 53:10.510]  I thought the dog bark would be more like...
[53:11.270 --> 53:11.830]  Pactice.
[53:12.590 --> 53:13.150]  Rookie.
[53:13.310 --> 53:13.710]  Carmelo.
[53:13.870 --> 53:14.530]  Anthony Mello.
[53:14.690 --> 53:15.050]  Yeah, Mello.
[53:15.890 --> 53:16.630]  Shadon Sharp.
[53:16.750 --> 53:17.170]  Instant Impact.
[53:17.270 --> 53:17.990]  Such an ugly card.
[53:18.410 --> 53:19.010]  Jabari Smith.
[53:19.350 --> 53:19.630]  Rookie.
[53:19.810 --> 53:20.210]  Base.
[53:20.350 --> 53:21.510]  Wilt Chamberlain.
[53:21.670 --> 53:22.210]  Bedded.
[53:22.290 --> 53:22.590]  10,000 women.
[53:22.590 --> 53:22.810]  Classic.
[53:22.990 --> 53:23.070]  Yep.
[53:23.330 --> 53:24.370]  Pascal Siakam.
[53:24.670 --> 53:25.210]  Kimba Walker.
[53:25.370 --> 53:25.930]  Ex-Celtic.
[53:26.210 --> 53:27.010]  LeBron James.
[53:27.070 --> 53:27.910]  LeBron James.
[53:29.290 --> 53:30.230]  The Unicorn.
[53:30.370 --> 53:31.670]  Chris Asporzinga's current Celtic.
[53:31.770 --> 53:31.910]  Yep.
[53:32.190 --> 53:33.430]  Dominique Wilkins.
[53:34.010 --> 53:34.890]  The human highlight reel.
[53:35.870 --> 53:36.910]  Jalen Sugg.
[53:37.290 --> 53:37.750]  Suggy.
[53:37.750 --> 53:38.860]  Terry Easton.
[53:39.530 --> 53:39.910]  Ugly.
[53:40.170 --> 53:41.250]  Instant Impact card.
[53:41.610 --> 53:42.450]  Daylan Perry.
[53:42.610 --> 53:42.930]  Rookie.
[53:43.410 --> 53:44.610]  Shaquille O'Neal with the big shorts.
[53:44.910 --> 53:45.010]  Hey!
[53:45.310 --> 53:50.610]  You ever see the video of Chris Asporzinga getting drafted and the guy going, who the
[53:50.610 --> 53:51.470]  hell is this?
[53:52.550 --> 53:53.470]  Kringus Pingus!
[53:53.810 --> 53:54.270]  What?
[53:56.470 --> 53:57.350]  Kringus Pingus?
[53:57.650 --> 54:00.150]  They call him Kringus Pingus and Kringus Pingus.
[54:00.470 --> 54:02.350]  It's so funny.
[54:02.550 --> 54:03.370]  Dude, I'm so...
[54:03.370 --> 54:03.870]  We need...
[54:03.870 --> 54:04.690]  Oh, you have your thing.
[54:04.790 --> 54:05.430]  Oh, I'm so excited.
[54:05.570 --> 54:05.730]  Okay.
[54:05.910 --> 54:06.150]  All right.
[54:06.150 --> 54:10.750]  So, if you don't know, we try to end the show with something big, something signed,
[54:10.870 --> 54:11.670]  something interesting.
[54:11.890 --> 54:12.170]  Big hit.
[54:12.210 --> 54:17.590]  We've done this goopy-ass little helmet signed by a guy who got drafted by the Astros, not
[54:17.590 --> 54:17.990]  the Astros.
[54:18.070 --> 54:19.110]  You know, they can't all be hits.
[54:19.250 --> 54:23.090]  Because before that, we got a signed basketball from Shaquille O'Neal!
[54:23.230 --> 54:23.510]  Check.
[54:23.630 --> 54:26.550]  So we have gotten a lot of weird stuff back and forth.
[54:26.810 --> 54:31.390]  It's been a lot of fun, but now Geoff's sort of branching out, trying different things.
[54:31.690 --> 54:33.490]  We got this baseball bat.
[54:34.230 --> 54:36.690]  Gracie's been graciously ordering stuff.
[54:36.810 --> 54:38.050]  Happy birthday to Gracie's dog, Cinnamon.
[54:38.330 --> 54:39.050]  Yay, 16!
[54:40.310 --> 54:41.810]  Cinnamon looks great for 16.
[54:43.070 --> 54:48.550]  But we've been reaching out, finding some weird stuff, and this is definitely...
[54:48.550 --> 54:51.030]  We have a signed basketball, or I'm sorry, football also.
[54:51.490 --> 54:53.910]  But what I need you to know, it's hard to see from that distance.
[54:54.030 --> 54:54.930]  Don't feel like you have to zoom in, you're fine.
[54:55.910 --> 55:02.110]  The DPI on this is so low, it's straight up like 72 JPEG.
[55:02.110 --> 55:03.690]  It looks like shit.
[55:03.950 --> 55:06.350]  But it doesn't matter what's on the outside, it's what's on the inside that counts, and
[55:06.350 --> 55:06.890]  that's why...
[55:06.890 --> 55:07.510]  Oh my god, it does.
[55:07.570 --> 55:09.170]  It looks like a wall in Doom.
[55:09.290 --> 55:10.170]  Yeah, it looks bad.
[55:10.250 --> 55:10.930]  So, here we go.
[55:11.010 --> 55:11.550]  Signed bat!
[55:11.870 --> 55:13.050]  We don't know who it is.
[55:14.070 --> 55:14.730]  Let's see.
[55:15.410 --> 55:16.090]  How's it looking?
[55:17.590 --> 55:18.370]  What's this paper?
[55:18.970 --> 55:19.930]  A piece of paper's in there.
[55:20.530 --> 55:21.550]  We're gonna need that piece of paper.
[55:21.770 --> 55:22.630]  It's right there.
[55:23.330 --> 55:24.590]  It's a PSA thing in here.
[55:24.670 --> 55:25.570]  Hot dogs!
[55:25.670 --> 55:27.110]  Get your hot dogs!
[55:28.090 --> 55:31.450]  Oh shit, it's not Shohei Otani.
[55:31.570 --> 55:32.090]  Is it a bandaid?
[55:32.110 --> 55:33.350]  It's Beto... Joe?
[55:33.450 --> 55:34.570]  It's Beto O'Rourke.
[55:34.970 --> 55:35.330]  Nuh-uh.
[55:35.510 --> 55:35.850]  No.
[55:36.690 --> 55:37.250]  It's...
[55:37.250 --> 55:38.430]  Broadway Joe.
[55:39.070 --> 55:39.550]  No.
[55:40.430 --> 55:41.550]  Balthazar Joe.
[55:44.290 --> 55:44.850]  It's...
[55:44.850 --> 55:45.850]  Uh...
[55:45.850 --> 55:47.950]  This item was autographed.
[55:48.670 --> 55:49.230]  Uh...
[55:49.230 --> 55:50.770]  It doesn't say who it is.
[55:51.130 --> 55:51.270]  No.
[55:51.790 --> 55:52.210]  No.
[55:52.470 --> 55:53.630]  Wait, is it inside of here?
[55:54.610 --> 55:55.070]  Oh.
[55:55.110 --> 55:55.650]  There's nothing else in here.
[55:55.830 --> 55:56.090]  Wait.
[55:56.430 --> 55:56.950]  It's at the...
[55:56.950 --> 55:57.410]  This one.
[55:57.490 --> 55:57.890]  Yeah!
[55:59.110 --> 56:01.790]  Go back to the...
[56:01.790 --> 56:02.090]  We gotta cut it.
[56:02.770 --> 56:04.570]  Let us know who you think it is.
[56:04.930 --> 56:06.190]  Go back to the overhead camera.
[56:06.290 --> 56:06.730]  There you go.
[56:06.730 --> 56:08.390]  That looks like Beto...
[56:08.390 --> 56:09.030]  Jarre...
[56:09.030 --> 56:09.730]  Gabe...
[56:09.730 --> 56:10.490]  Get...
[56:10.950 --> 56:11.170]  Get...
[56:11.170 --> 56:12.150]  What do you guys think, Justin?
[56:12.210 --> 56:12.550]  What do you think?
[56:12.610 --> 56:12.930]  See...
[56:13.390 --> 56:13.830]  Get...
[56:13.830 --> 56:14.270]  It's a...
[56:15.530 --> 56:15.970]  Cage...
[56:16.910 --> 56:17.350]  Cage...
[56:17.350 --> 56:17.990]  Prumfum.
[56:18.350 --> 56:19.510]  What do you think it is, Geoffy?
[56:20.410 --> 56:21.530]  It's Ghetto Joe.
[56:21.770 --> 56:22.050]  Nope.
[56:22.810 --> 56:23.430]  Ghetto Joe.
[56:23.710 --> 56:25.130]  But there's 4256.
[56:25.370 --> 56:26.250]  Could be Connor Joe.
[56:26.470 --> 56:28.250]  Oh, it's probably 4256.
[56:28.550 --> 56:28.970]  I don't know.
[56:29.070 --> 56:31.470]  Who's got 4256 hits?
[56:32.910 --> 56:34.890]  It's gotta be a Hall of Famer, probably.
[56:35.490 --> 56:37.310]  Someone says Connor Joe.
[56:37.630 --> 56:38.870]  It can't be Pete Rose.
[56:38.970 --> 56:39.710]  There's no fucking way.
[56:39.890 --> 56:40.930]  Oh, Pete Rose!
[56:41.150 --> 56:41.930]  Is it really?
[56:42.790 --> 56:44.890]  Charlie Hustle himself, Pete Rose.
[56:45.050 --> 56:46.370]  It really is Pete Rose.
[56:46.670 --> 56:49.930]  Could have got this by going to any mall in Las Vegas on any given day.
[56:49.930 --> 56:51.550]  Do you think that's how they got this?
[56:52.170 --> 56:53.430]  What is Pete Rose's story?
[56:53.510 --> 56:53.830]  I don't know.
[56:53.870 --> 56:54.510]  I just know that name.
[56:54.610 --> 56:56.670]  Let's talk about Pete Rose's story for a second.
[56:56.770 --> 56:57.290]  This is awesome.
[56:57.490 --> 56:58.490]  I love Pete Rose.
[56:58.610 --> 56:59.870]  Everybody loves Charlie Hustle.
[56:59.930 --> 57:00.950]  The coolest.
[57:00.950 --> 57:05.390]  I would never get a Pete Rose autograph otherwise.
[57:05.830 --> 57:06.390]  You know what I mean?
[57:06.710 --> 57:06.870]  Yeah.
[57:07.270 --> 57:11.030]  Pete Rose is a guy who was banned from baseball for betting on baseball.
[57:11.310 --> 57:11.730]  Hell yeah.
[57:11.970 --> 57:16.110]  The problem with that is that it wasn't like he was the only one doing it.
[57:16.330 --> 57:19.870]  And also, he was so fucking good at baseball.
[57:20.110 --> 57:25.990]  You are denying such a piece of history by him betting on baseball while he was a coach, I think.
[57:26.090 --> 57:28.450]  That is an ultimate fuck-face move.
[57:28.630 --> 57:28.850]  Yes.
[57:29.050 --> 57:29.950]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Big time.
[57:29.950 --> 57:31.710]  So now here's the thing about Pete Rose.
[57:31.850 --> 57:38.830]  If you go to one of the malls in Vegas, he's always there and you pay him and he will sign anything and he will write whatever you want.
[57:39.190 --> 57:41.890]  Yeah, Pete Rose got, he got so kind of fucked.
[57:42.030 --> 57:44.290]  I don't know if you should say fucked over.
[57:44.770 --> 57:45.050]  It's hard.
[57:45.130 --> 57:45.830]  The guy bet on baseball.
[57:45.970 --> 57:50.690]  He was a manager who was betting against his own team while he was managing that team.
[57:50.710 --> 57:52.270]  He was the guy they made an example out of.
[57:52.450 --> 57:54.430]  So they made a hard example out of him.
[57:54.430 --> 57:54.610]  Yeah.
[57:54.890 --> 57:55.330]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[57:55.330 --> 57:56.970]  So banned from baseball for life.
[57:59.330 --> 58:01.670]  Really crazy that he'll sign anything you want.
[58:01.990 --> 58:03.910]  Yeah, but he's like, it's just, it's become a joke.
[58:03.930 --> 58:05.650]  But anytime I go to Vegas, I feel like Pete.
[58:05.770 --> 58:07.530]  It's always like, Pete Rose signing today only.
[58:07.570 --> 58:08.970]  And it's like today only and tomorrow only.
[58:09.290 --> 58:12.130]  Pete Rose is probably the athlete I've seen the most in person.
[58:12.430 --> 58:12.630]  Yeah.
[58:12.890 --> 58:13.210]  Really?
[58:13.430 --> 58:13.650]  Yeah.
[58:13.910 --> 58:16.290]  So can he not go to any baseball games or anything?
[58:16.490 --> 58:17.050]  No, not really.
[58:17.170 --> 58:17.470]  I don't think.
[58:17.910 --> 58:18.630]  That's cool.
[58:18.750 --> 58:19.370]  I'll show that off.
[58:19.510 --> 58:20.610]  First off, we got beach volleyball.
[58:20.770 --> 58:21.230]  Let's see that.
[58:21.930 --> 58:23.210]  And then we got Gary Sheffield mini.
[58:23.210 --> 58:23.830]  Oh, nice.
[58:23.970 --> 58:28.210]  Then we got a Eloy Jimenez bat card.
[58:28.770 --> 58:30.610]  That is a piece of a bat, I believe.
[58:30.790 --> 58:31.230]  Oh, wow.
[58:31.350 --> 58:31.830]  Bat relic.
[58:32.090 --> 58:33.070]  Hey, we got two bats today.
[58:33.290 --> 58:33.450]  Nice.
[58:33.450 --> 58:34.610]  Yeah, this features memorabilia.
[58:34.770 --> 58:36.430]  Star outfielder from the Chicago White Sox.
[58:36.490 --> 58:38.550]  Not a leader, but he is a good baseball player.
[58:38.950 --> 58:39.430]  We'll just leave that.
[58:39.490 --> 58:39.830]  That was cool.
[58:39.870 --> 58:40.750]  I just thought I'd throw that in there.
[58:41.430 --> 58:43.290]  But yeah, so Pete Rose, they made an example out of him.
[58:43.370 --> 58:45.550]  They bet they won't let him in the Hall of Fame.
[58:45.770 --> 58:48.850]  Somebody in the chat said, but he was betting for his team, not against them.
[58:48.910 --> 58:49.210]  Oh, right.
[58:49.210 --> 58:52.070]  I don't think that matters to the MLB at all.
[58:52.070 --> 58:52.270]  At all.
[58:52.270 --> 58:52.670]  Yeah.
[58:53.150 --> 58:54.950]  He's like, I just thought that was so good.
[58:55.330 --> 58:56.830]  Oh, dude, you're betting for your team?
[58:56.990 --> 58:57.650]  Come on in.
[58:58.110 --> 58:58.990]  Get in here, bud.
[58:59.230 --> 59:00.530]  Sometimes he was betting for his team, sometimes.
[59:01.590 --> 59:02.390]  Well, there you have it.
[59:02.390 --> 59:04.210]  He sure said that he was betting for his team.
[59:05.650 --> 59:06.250]  We did it!
[59:06.270 --> 59:06.450]  Awesome.
[59:06.890 --> 59:08.130]  A Pete Rose bat.
[59:08.210 --> 59:09.470]  Dude, what a Kool-Aid ball.
[59:09.690 --> 59:10.110]  It's interesting.
[59:10.230 --> 59:11.070]  We're getting some real greats.
[59:11.110 --> 59:12.150]  We got Pete Rose in baseball.
[59:12.410 --> 59:13.730]  We got Shakil O'Neal.
[59:14.310 --> 59:15.310]  I can't wait to see that.
[59:15.630 --> 59:17.330]  Travis Kelsey football?
[59:17.490 --> 59:18.750]  What if it's a Joe Namath?
[59:19.150 --> 59:20.070]  That would be cool.
[59:20.070 --> 59:22.670]  I mean, he's a big-time guy.
[59:22.930 --> 59:23.430]  Mitch Hanegar.
[59:23.650 --> 59:25.550]  I'm just opening it up as we...
[59:25.550 --> 59:26.630]  I'm going to play us out.
[59:26.910 --> 59:27.330]  What if it's...
[59:27.330 --> 59:28.230]  Aaron Judge.
[59:29.250 --> 59:31.050]  We got Tony Olivia.

[59:58.750 --> 01:00:00.050]  Don't remember him with the rays at all.
[01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:01.810]  This is a used memorabilia.
[01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:04.450]  Does it mean that he blogged while wearing this shirt?
[01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:06.910]  Yeah, it's 100% some jeans that he was wearing.
[01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:08.210]  Well, we did it.
