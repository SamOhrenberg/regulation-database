[00:16.940 --> 00:22.700]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, almost always, the beautiful and talented Emily Hatfield.
[00:23.200 --> 00:27.600]  And then, instead of Eric, we have a pile of crap that will open at some point.
[00:28.880 --> 00:34.140]  Just off the bat, just to let you guys know, Emily and I just came in from the airport.
[00:34.320 --> 00:36.960]  We literally drove in from... I guess we drove in from the airport.
[00:37.120 --> 00:38.780]  We flew in from another place to the airport.
[00:39.120 --> 00:41.280]  It was a whole complicated scenario.
[00:41.800 --> 00:44.460]  And so, we're a little disheveled.
[00:44.460 --> 00:48.400]  I didn't get a chance to price last week's cards out because we've been out of town all weekend.
[00:48.800 --> 00:52.920]  Eric is clearly not here. He hasn't been replaced by a mini helmet and a football.
[00:53.120 --> 00:56.100]  Although, there might be suitable replacements for him.
[00:56.520 --> 00:57.620]  You can't see it, but they're in his chair.
[00:58.100 --> 01:01.180]  He is still, to my knowledge, still in Key West.
[01:02.620 --> 01:05.400]  You'll hear about it in the podcast. We'll talk about it extensively in the podcast.
[01:05.560 --> 01:08.120]  We have probably... We were joking around about it last night.
[01:08.420 --> 01:10.440]  I think we probably have two episodes of content.
[01:10.440 --> 01:13.600]  Just in shit that happened in Key West over the weekend.
[01:14.620 --> 01:17.540]  Gavin was there. Eric was there. We were there.
[01:17.940 --> 01:19.680]  We had a grand old time. And some other friends.
[01:20.100 --> 01:23.420]  I don't want to spoil anything, but let me just say there were curses.
[01:23.560 --> 01:26.820]  There were dolphins. There was a go-go now rescue.
[01:28.260 --> 01:30.440]  There... Oh, jeez. There was a lot of key lime pie.
[01:30.440 --> 01:31.240]  There was a lot of jet ski.
[01:32.300 --> 01:35.240]  Safety rope snapped. Somebody got abandoned at sea.
[01:36.860 --> 01:37.660]  It was...
[01:38.280 --> 01:38.680]  Urchins.
[01:38.680 --> 01:41.200]  Oh, there were sea urchins everywhere. Everybody's hurt.
[01:41.620 --> 01:43.000]  Everybody came home with injuries.
[01:44.120 --> 01:45.560]  It's about as good as you can hope for.
[01:45.840 --> 01:46.360]  Live bingo.
[01:46.600 --> 01:48.500]  Oh, we played live Sloppy Joe's bingo.
[01:48.700 --> 01:49.240]  That was amazing.
[01:49.900 --> 01:54.560]  If you were hanging out on the internet over the weekend and happened to tune in to the Sloppy Joe's feed,
[01:54.620 --> 01:57.180]  you might have seen us there five or six or twelve times.
[01:57.800 --> 01:59.460]  Anyway, it was a grand old time.
[01:59.600 --> 02:04.680]  And we'll get into it on the Face podcast, which...
[02:04.680 --> 02:06.940]  Well, I guess for you it'll be like three weeks, because we were ahead.
[02:06.940 --> 02:09.160]  So eventually you'll hear about it.
[02:09.240 --> 02:09.400]  Yeah.
[02:09.660 --> 02:10.060]  Eventually.
[02:10.260 --> 02:14.800]  I mean, I think it's some deep lore stuff was born this weekend for sure.
[02:15.340 --> 02:19.500]  We had a weekend of would-you-rathers that involved dogs and Andrew.
[02:19.680 --> 02:21.940]  They were all hypothetical and everything respawns.
[02:22.640 --> 02:24.240]  We had to make that very clear.
[02:25.240 --> 02:28.080]  Everything respawns and you don't have to clean anything up.
[02:29.180 --> 02:30.880]  Yeah, everything... it all respawns.
[02:30.940 --> 02:31.440]  We'll just say that.
[02:31.660 --> 02:33.420]  Anyway, we'll get into it on the podcast.
[02:33.540 --> 02:34.600]  I don't want to cut into the podcast.
[02:35.520 --> 02:39.520]  Meanwhile, we've got a bunch of crap to open for you guys that we're very excited about.
[02:40.180 --> 02:45.160]  First things first, as you know, we start the show off with the pack sack.
[02:45.300 --> 02:46.880]  So let's open up...
[02:46.880 --> 02:47.560]  Oh, I dropped something.
[02:48.180 --> 02:49.020]  Let's open...
[02:49.020 --> 02:49.780]  Oh, what did I drop?
[02:50.080 --> 02:52.620]  Oh, just the Sloppy Joe's bingo set.
[02:53.060 --> 02:56.600]  If you can't make it in person, it's fun to watch remotely with this.
[02:56.680 --> 02:58.420]  Yeah, and play remotely with this.
[02:58.580 --> 02:59.340]  It's got a t-shirt.
[02:59.460 --> 03:00.220]  It's got daubers.
[03:00.500 --> 03:02.100]  It's got 25...
[03:02.100 --> 03:02.780]  I keep getting it wrong.
[03:03.100 --> 03:05.620]  It's got 25 bingo cards in it.
[03:05.760 --> 03:06.560]  Yeah, 25.
[03:07.260 --> 03:09.240]  So if you have 25 friends, you can all play at once.
[03:09.420 --> 03:11.020]  Or you can play by yourself 25 times.
[03:11.180 --> 03:15.540]  Or you can play 25 times, three times, because the daubers are three different colors.
[03:15.780 --> 03:16.520]  And so then you can just...
[03:16.520 --> 03:17.080]  You can reuse the sheets.
[03:17.220 --> 03:17.880]  Reuse the sheets.
[03:17.960 --> 03:19.460]  75 times you can play by yourself.
[03:19.700 --> 03:19.840]  Yeah.
[03:20.120 --> 03:21.120]  That's pretty good.
[03:21.460 --> 03:23.420]  Anyway, you should buy that if you want on the store.
[03:23.520 --> 03:24.040]  You don't have to.
[03:24.360 --> 03:25.320]  I understand if you don't want to.
[03:25.360 --> 03:27.140]  But if you did want to, I wouldn't mind.
[03:27.560 --> 03:29.000]  All right, we're going to open up something from the...
[03:29.000 --> 03:29.400]  Let's see what we got.
[03:29.540 --> 03:31.060]  Oh, Lion King.
[03:31.060 --> 03:33.060]  Let's open up two packs, because...
[03:35.080 --> 03:35.880]  Oh, Corvettes.
[03:36.020 --> 03:37.260]  All right, let's see what we got.
[03:38.500 --> 03:41.100]  Do you remember when the Lion King came out?
[03:41.200 --> 03:41.740]  Was that like...
[03:41.740 --> 03:44.440]  You were older, but was it a big deal to you?
[03:44.500 --> 03:47.480]  Well, I don't want to have an awkward conversation here with you,
[03:47.580 --> 03:49.460]  but I saw the Lion King on a first date.
[03:49.760 --> 03:51.780]  Oh, wow.
[03:52.080 --> 03:54.120]  What was her fucking name?
[03:54.140 --> 03:54.940]  Her fucking...
[03:54.940 --> 03:55.860]  Her name was Nicole.
[03:56.260 --> 03:56.540]  Nicole.
[03:56.540 --> 03:57.960]  And she was lovely.
[03:58.120 --> 03:58.520]  Wow.
[03:58.740 --> 03:59.880]  She worked at the...
[03:59.880 --> 04:00.380]  Wow.
[04:00.800 --> 04:02.040]  Fairy Queen in the mall.
[04:02.320 --> 04:03.920]  You know, I love a woman with a job.
[04:04.340 --> 04:06.320]  And we went on the Lion King...
[04:06.320 --> 04:08.380]  We saw the Lion King together, and I was too scared to kiss her,
[04:08.500 --> 04:10.420]  and she dumped a bucket of popcorn on my head,
[04:10.460 --> 04:12.860]  and then we became very good friends for many years.
[04:13.140 --> 04:16.120]  Did she dump the popcorn on your head because you wouldn't kiss her?
[04:16.200 --> 04:17.540]  I think it's because I'm a fucking dork.
[04:17.840 --> 04:18.460]  And so that would be funny.
[04:18.840 --> 04:20.300]  Anyway, nothing romantic ever happened.
[04:20.420 --> 04:23.180]  And then when she was engaged to be married to some other dude,
[04:23.240 --> 04:24.080]  she called me and she goes,
[04:24.140 --> 04:25.020]  I think I'm in love with you.
[04:25.220 --> 04:26.700]  I don't know if I should marry this guy.
[04:26.860 --> 04:27.800]  And I said,
[04:28.200 --> 04:29.260]  I think you're having cold feet.
[04:29.260 --> 04:31.500]  You should probably stick, marry this guy.
[04:31.620 --> 04:32.820]  There was never anything between us.
[04:32.940 --> 04:34.220]  So I think you just...
[04:34.220 --> 04:35.940]  Just focus on your current relationship.
[04:36.260 --> 04:38.100]  Do you think that...
[04:38.100 --> 04:39.720]  It sucks because she was really hot.
[04:40.720 --> 04:42.740]  Do you think that before our wedding,
[04:42.860 --> 04:44.540]  you're going to call her and be like,
[04:44.760 --> 04:47.240]  Nicole, I made a big mistake years ago.
[04:47.320 --> 04:47.840]  Here's the deal.
[04:47.920 --> 04:48.840]  I didn't the first two times.
[04:50.120 --> 04:51.500]  So I don't know why I would this time.
[04:52.320 --> 04:53.020]  Here we go.
[04:53.220 --> 04:53.840]  There's that guy.
[04:54.340 --> 04:54.680]  Scar.
[04:54.680 --> 05:01.340]  We had a moment like from Lion King this weekend.
[05:02.160 --> 05:03.460]  When you...
[05:03.460 --> 05:05.720]  I don't want to spoil it,
[05:05.780 --> 05:07.560]  but when you let go of Gavin's hand.
[05:10.060 --> 05:11.040]  You were Scar.
[05:11.040 --> 05:12.720]  It's my favorite story from the weekend.
[05:13.040 --> 05:14.680]  So I guess I was the role of Scar.
[05:14.680 --> 05:15.640]  Who was Gavin in that role?
[05:15.840 --> 05:17.780]  Gavin was Simba's dad.
[05:17.940 --> 05:18.360]  Mustafa?
[05:18.820 --> 05:19.280]  Mufasa.
[05:19.380 --> 05:19.800]  Mufasa?
[05:20.440 --> 05:20.860]  Is that him?
[05:21.220 --> 05:21.540]  Mufasa?
[05:21.860 --> 05:23.640]  That was Gavin and this was you.
[05:23.640 --> 05:25.760]  This was you on the lily pad.
[05:27.860 --> 05:29.380]  I can't wait to tell that story.
[05:29.820 --> 05:30.640]  Here's Rafiki.
[05:31.740 --> 05:33.420]  That was Eric this weekend.
[05:33.640 --> 05:34.680]  And here's another Rafiki.
[05:34.840 --> 05:35.840]  We got dual Rafikis.
[05:36.360 --> 05:38.060]  No, you know who's Rafiki was Bernie.
[05:38.280 --> 05:39.580]  Was our friend Bernie Batdog.
[05:39.820 --> 05:41.020]  Careful, not Bernie Burns.
[05:41.120 --> 05:41.520]  He wasn't there.
[05:41.600 --> 05:42.380]  Bernie Batdog was.
[05:43.500 --> 05:44.380]  There's Saraboo.
[05:44.680 --> 05:45.120]  Sarabee.
[05:45.360 --> 05:45.800]  Saraboo.
[05:45.880 --> 05:47.000]  I feel Saraboo.
[05:48.520 --> 05:48.960]  Sarabi.
[05:49.700 --> 05:51.060]  There's Mufasa again.
[05:51.180 --> 05:51.700]  That was you.
[05:51.820 --> 05:52.340]  Scar again.
[05:52.860 --> 05:54.140]  And then this is you.
[05:56.700 --> 05:57.800]  Shinzi, Banzai, and Ed.
[05:58.260 --> 05:59.140]  You were the little hyenas.
[06:01.180 --> 06:02.260]  These cards are trash.
[06:02.360 --> 06:02.960]  I'm gonna throw them away.
[06:04.600 --> 06:06.900]  Maybe we'll have more luck with the vet set.
[06:08.140 --> 06:10.640]  The nice thing about this, this is all the way back from 1991.
[06:11.100 --> 06:11.540]  Where were you?
[06:12.020 --> 06:12.440]  You know what?
[06:12.460 --> 06:13.580]  I don't want to know what you were doing in 1991.
[06:14.240 --> 06:14.560]  1991.
[06:18.020 --> 06:19.300]  I was five.
[06:19.340 --> 06:20.040]  You were being a cool guy.
[06:21.420 --> 06:22.460]  Being five years old.
[06:22.560 --> 06:23.680]  What were you doing in 91?
[06:24.120 --> 06:25.340]  I wasn't driving a Corvette.
[06:25.740 --> 06:27.600]  When did Lion King come out?
[06:27.840 --> 06:29.560]  I think I got my driver's license in 91.
[06:29.940 --> 06:30.340]  Nice.
[06:30.460 --> 06:31.400]  So did you get a Corvette?
[06:31.880 --> 06:32.820]  I did not.
[06:32.940 --> 06:33.960]  I did get a red truck.
[06:34.180 --> 06:37.500]  It was red, but it was a Ford Courier pickup truck.
[06:37.560 --> 06:38.600]  1977, I believe.
[06:38.840 --> 06:42.460]  And it had the driver's side door fall off, so you couldn't open it.
[06:42.460 --> 06:46.420]  My dad had connected it with coat hanger wires.
[06:46.620 --> 06:51.500]  He took four coat hanger wires and stuck it together, so it was safe.
[06:51.560 --> 06:53.960]  But it would vibrate sometimes, so you'd have to tighten the coat hanger wires.
[06:54.160 --> 06:56.960]  Was this the car that you had a Flintstone floor?
[06:57.000 --> 06:57.800]  Yeah, there was a hole.
[06:57.940 --> 07:01.460]  The floor had rusted through, and so you could see the road when you were driving.
[07:01.760 --> 07:05.240]  So if I drove in the rain, the bottom third of me got very wet.
[07:05.360 --> 07:06.000]  And muddy.
[07:07.100 --> 07:08.900]  Anyway, that's the 73 Vet.
[07:08.980 --> 07:09.980]  What's your favorite Corvette?
[07:10.240 --> 07:12.200]  I'll tell you what, it's not that one for me.
[07:12.200 --> 07:13.840]  Have you ever been in a Corvette?
[07:18.690 --> 07:19.090]  Yes.
[07:19.350 --> 07:20.410]  We got there eventually.
[07:20.570 --> 07:20.850]  No.
[07:22.330 --> 07:22.730]  Maybe.
[07:23.430 --> 07:23.630]  Oh?
[07:24.170 --> 07:25.830]  Did Nicole drive a Corvette?
[07:26.410 --> 07:26.810]  No.
[07:27.370 --> 07:28.550]  Did she get in one?
[07:29.950 --> 07:31.310]  Your new girlfriend, Nicole?
[07:31.770 --> 07:33.010]  We never dated.
[07:33.850 --> 07:35.070]  But she's in love with you.
[07:35.130 --> 07:35.770]  I was a good guy.
[07:35.850 --> 07:37.410]  I had my shot, and I was a good guy, and I said no.
[07:39.050 --> 07:39.950]  I don't think so.
[07:41.050 --> 07:44.950]  A guy that we used to work with named Bruce, who lives in L.A. in Funhaus.
[07:45.150 --> 07:47.170]  He had either a Corvette or a Camaro.
[07:47.270 --> 07:47.930]  I can't remember which one.
[07:48.250 --> 07:51.730]  But I don't think I've ever been in a... unless that was his car, I don't think I've ever been in one.
[07:52.210 --> 07:54.870]  There's an 88 Corvette going 87 miles per hour.
[07:54.950 --> 07:57.710]  It is in the process of traveling through time, it looks like.
[07:58.270 --> 07:59.970]  67, that's a gorgeous one.
[08:01.270 --> 08:03.310]  Oh, a 73, a little stingray.
[08:03.390 --> 08:03.930]  That's pretty.
[08:04.350 --> 08:05.350]  That's my kind of Corvette.
[08:05.590 --> 08:07.950]  Thanks for asking, but the only time I've ever been in a Corvette...
[08:09.150 --> 08:10.610]  Thanks for asking me.
[08:10.830 --> 08:12.490]  Have you ever been in a Corvette?
[08:12.570 --> 08:18.410]  You know what? The one time that I've been in a Corvette was when Barbie came to my birthday party.
[08:19.070 --> 08:22.910]  She showed up for my sixth birthday party.
[08:22.990 --> 08:28.190]  My parents hired Barbie to come, and she showed up in a Corvette.
[08:28.510 --> 08:30.010]  And she drove me around the block.
[08:30.430 --> 08:31.810]  And it was the coolest thing ever.
[08:31.910 --> 08:33.510]  She could barely fit in there with her huge skirt.
[08:33.670 --> 08:36.190]  I saw the pictures, and it looks like she showed up smoking.
[08:36.190 --> 08:37.490]  Yeah, it was one of those things.
[08:37.550 --> 08:40.910]  We lived in California at the time, and when we look back at the video, we're like,
[08:41.050 --> 08:42.670]  why does Barbie have Alaska plates?
[08:43.770 --> 08:47.490]  And you look at her now, and you're like, Barbie's looking a little rough.
[08:47.550 --> 08:50.230]  But to a child, I was like, oh my God, it's Barbie.
[08:50.370 --> 08:51.430]  Like, it was everything.
[08:51.630 --> 08:54.850]  I didn't know Barbie also dealt coke on the side until that party, yeah.
[08:55.550 --> 08:56.630]  There's an 88 Corvette.
[08:56.690 --> 08:57.690]  They're all red, by the way.
[08:59.170 --> 09:00.470]  86, ugly, ugly Corvette.
[09:01.650 --> 09:03.870]  Great year to be born, bad year to be a Corvette.
[09:04.470 --> 09:08.050]  You stole all the beauty in 86, so there wasn't enough left for the Corvettes.
[09:08.070 --> 09:09.010]  Thank you, thank you.
[09:09.210 --> 09:11.290]  Here's a picture of a Corvette logo.
[09:11.470 --> 09:11.870]  Nice.
[09:12.430 --> 09:15.190]  Oh, 63 Corvette, now that's a gorgeous car.
[09:15.470 --> 09:18.010]  And then another 63, it's actually not red this time.
[09:18.130 --> 09:18.670]  Silver bullet.
[09:19.690 --> 09:20.070]  Isn't that pretty?
[09:20.230 --> 09:20.830]  It's beautiful.
[09:21.810 --> 09:22.910]  Yeah, oh, shit.
[09:23.090 --> 09:24.630]  Would you rather drive a Corvette or a Ferrari?
[09:25.670 --> 09:27.030]  I'll take either, I don't give a shit.
[09:27.230 --> 09:32.210]  I would rather drive a Ferrari, I think, because it's three times the value of a Corvette,
[09:32.390 --> 09:33.450]  but I would take a Corvette.
[09:33.450 --> 09:34.410]  Are you offering?
[09:34.830 --> 09:35.850]  You got Ferrari money?
[09:35.890 --> 09:36.910]  Maybe, maybe.
[09:37.870 --> 09:38.650]  You holding out on me?
[09:38.650 --> 09:40.670]  We'll see how things go.
[09:40.890 --> 09:41.850]  We'll see what you open up today.
[09:42.730 --> 09:44.070]  See if you can get me some...
[09:44.070 --> 09:46.390]  I already got my Jet Ski card ready to go.
[09:46.730 --> 09:50.190]  Speaking of opening up, I don't know where Aaron keeps the mail,
[09:50.330 --> 09:53.430]  so I just went into the mail room and I found one thing that was addressed to face,
[09:53.610 --> 09:54.410]  and so I grabbed it.
[09:54.890 --> 09:56.210]  And so let's see what it is.
[09:58.470 --> 09:59.190]  It says...
[10:00.850 --> 10:03.630]  For the love of God, don't read this on air.
[10:04.010 --> 10:06.110]  Help, I'm trapped in a factory.
[10:06.130 --> 10:08.390]  Now, it says read or don't read, either way is fine with me.
[10:08.590 --> 10:10.030]  Hello, Geoff, Emily.
[10:10.390 --> 10:10.730]  Hi.
[10:12.130 --> 10:13.450]  Eric's Assemblage of Boxes.
[10:13.650 --> 10:16.150]  And whoever else is on the Break Show, all of you,
[10:16.950 --> 10:21.270]  we've seen... I've been a big fan of Fuck Face since the beginning,
[10:21.610 --> 10:23.510]  and to show my appreciation, I've sent you some goodies.
[10:23.650 --> 10:24.770]  Thanks, warm regards, Matt.
[10:24.830 --> 10:25.490]  Thank you, Matt.
[10:25.750 --> 10:28.270]  Warm regards, warm re-regards, back to you.
[10:28.270 --> 10:29.150]  Are these what he sent?
[10:29.370 --> 10:31.050]  Yeah, this is what Matt sent, so let's go through it.
[10:31.410 --> 10:34.270]  He sent... First off, he sent some 91 score hockey,
[10:34.430 --> 10:37.170]  so the first thing we're gonna do, because there's multiple packs,
[10:37.230 --> 10:38.330]  we're gonna throw that right in the pack sack.
[10:38.470 --> 10:38.610]  Yeah.
[10:38.730 --> 10:39.970]  Gotta feed the pack sack, it's hungry.
[10:40.990 --> 10:41.790]  It wants to eat.
[10:42.550 --> 10:44.350]  And then let's go through this beautiful cart.
[10:44.990 --> 10:45.610]  Yeah, that was it.
[10:46.230 --> 10:46.830]  Let's see what we got.
[10:46.870 --> 10:48.610]  We got a... ooh, we got a...
[10:49.590 --> 10:56.370]  We got an on-card autograph from San Francisco Giants player,
[10:57.030 --> 10:57.830]  Boof Bonser.
[10:58.130 --> 10:58.530]  Boof?
[10:58.630 --> 11:01.330]  I've never heard of Boof Bonser before.
[11:01.490 --> 11:03.170]  There he is right there, Boof Bonser.
[11:03.410 --> 11:04.690]  Boof can be my new favorite.
[11:05.090 --> 11:06.650]  Booger is my favorite football player.
[11:06.770 --> 11:08.310]  Yeah, Booger McFarlane's your favorite football player.
[11:08.330 --> 11:09.750]  But Boof is...
[11:09.750 --> 11:11.770]  That's a lot of alliteration there, that's good.
[11:12.690 --> 11:13.690]  Matt, that's awesome.
[11:13.810 --> 11:14.690]  Should we get it graded?
[11:14.890 --> 11:15.330]  Yeah, maybe.
[11:15.330 --> 11:15.750]  It already has...
[11:15.750 --> 11:18.290]  It already came from PSA, it's been certified by PSA probably.
[11:20.550 --> 11:21.550]  Sweet Spot Swatches.
[11:22.010 --> 11:22.810]  Oh, Pedro Martinez!
[11:23.850 --> 11:24.070]  Hey!
[11:24.930 --> 11:26.310]  One half of our heart.
[11:26.490 --> 11:26.930]  Yeah.
[11:27.210 --> 11:28.310]  Done on Pedro, right here, on my body.
[11:29.010 --> 11:30.830]  That's beautiful, thank you so much.
[11:31.370 --> 11:32.350]  It's a...
[11:32.350 --> 11:32.870]  Probably game...
[11:32.870 --> 11:34.950]  Let's see if this is game used or worn.
[11:38.490 --> 11:41.390]  You've received a Pedro Martinez game used jersey.
[11:41.530 --> 11:41.770]  Dang!
[11:42.110 --> 11:43.510]  Trading card from the Upper Deck Company LLC.
[11:43.870 --> 11:47.010]  On the front of this card is an authentic piece of a jersey worn by Pedro
[11:47.010 --> 11:49.510]  in an official Red Sox Major League Baseball game.
[11:49.790 --> 11:51.890]  We hope you enjoy this piece of MLB history,
[11:51.890 --> 11:56.890]  as we at the Upper Deck Company continue to keep you as close as you can get.
[11:59.990 --> 12:00.990]  And oh!
[12:03.810 --> 12:04.650]  Big hit!
[12:05.610 --> 12:06.530]  Look at that!
[12:06.790 --> 12:07.290]  Dang.
[12:07.390 --> 12:12.810]  Don Zimmer, 100 year anniversary game worn jersey.
[12:13.190 --> 12:14.020]  Look at him just...
[12:14.470 --> 12:16.050]  Just there with his cheeks.
[12:16.830 --> 12:17.330]  Yeah.
[12:17.850 --> 12:19.050]  Those cheeks are everything, aren't they?
[12:19.110 --> 12:19.510]  They are.
[12:19.690 --> 12:20.870]  You know what they say, his cheeks don't lie.
[12:20.870 --> 12:22.250]  I just want to squish him.
[12:23.450 --> 12:24.990]  This is FLIR 2001.
[12:25.630 --> 12:29.030]  You've just received a card which contains a piece of authentic game worn jersey
[12:29.030 --> 12:31.110]  which has been worn by Don Zimmer of the Boston Red Sox.
[12:31.330 --> 12:31.430]  Wow.
[12:31.970 --> 12:35.850]  So Pedro and Zimmer, back when they were on the same...
[12:35.850 --> 12:36.950]  So they're both Red Sox?
[12:37.090 --> 12:38.050]  Well, at this time.
[12:38.650 --> 12:40.810]  I don't know if they were Red Sox at the same time.
[12:41.310 --> 12:42.230]  But their outfits are.
[12:42.230 --> 12:44.270]  They definitely weren't when they were fighting on the field.
[12:44.390 --> 12:47.190]  He was a coach for the Yankees and he was still for the Red Sox.
[12:47.330 --> 12:49.190]  Okay, so did he play...
[12:49.190 --> 12:51.550]  I know you've explained it before, but I just need a refresher.
[12:51.670 --> 12:53.330]  They were both coaches at the time?
[12:53.390 --> 12:54.010]  No, he was a player.
[12:54.110 --> 12:54.470]  He was pitching.
[12:54.850 --> 12:56.710]  Oh, I thought that they were...
[12:56.710 --> 12:57.690]  And Don and Zimmer charged the mound.
[12:58.590 --> 13:01.310]  Oh, that gives so much more to the story.
[13:01.610 --> 13:04.610]  Yeah, Don Zimmer was in his 70s and Pedro was at the height of his...
[13:04.610 --> 13:06.030]  I thought they were two managers.
[13:06.290 --> 13:07.150]  Or like, whatever.
[13:07.390 --> 13:09.050]  No, no, no, no.
[13:09.470 --> 13:11.370]  There was about a 40-year difference.
[13:11.590 --> 13:14.430]  No, maybe a 45, 50-year difference between them during the fight.
[13:14.570 --> 13:16.430]  Okay, I just thought Pedro aged better.
[13:18.670 --> 13:23.070]  Well, even now I don't think he's as old as Don Zimmer in that photo, so we'll see if he ages better.
[13:23.490 --> 13:23.530]  Dang.
[13:23.630 --> 13:25.110]  What else do we... let's open up one of these packs.
[13:25.290 --> 13:28.130]  Alright, everybody loves 91 score hockey.
[13:30.010 --> 13:31.310]  We're all probably excited.
[13:31.410 --> 13:33.350]  I know Eric loves when I read off hockey names.
[13:34.390 --> 13:36.710]  Steve Larmer, Thomas...
[13:36.710 --> 13:38.670]  That guy didn't even have a helmet on. Steve.
[13:38.910 --> 13:41.070]  They didn't wear helmets back then.
[13:41.950 --> 13:43.890]  In the 90s, they were real men.
[13:43.890 --> 13:45.630]  Dana Mersin.
[13:46.090 --> 13:47.550]  Danton Cole.
[13:48.130 --> 13:49.590]  Mike Keene.
[13:50.270 --> 13:52.050]  Sergei Fedorov. I've heard of him.
[13:52.910 --> 13:53.890]  I thought he played tennis.
[13:54.230 --> 13:54.650]  Guess not.
[13:55.890 --> 13:57.290]  Ed Belfort. I've heard of him.
[13:57.910 --> 14:00.450]  Ed Belfort. I heard of him one card ago.
[14:01.330 --> 14:02.550]  Martin Galenas.
[14:03.310 --> 14:05.790]  Igor Larionov.
[14:06.750 --> 14:08.230]  Craig Mooney.
[14:08.810 --> 14:10.330]  Bob Probert.
[14:11.610 --> 14:12.530]  Probert.
[14:14.030 --> 14:14.750]  Brenton Ashton.
[14:15.710 --> 14:16.430]  Glenn Healy.
[14:17.390 --> 14:19.530]  And Craig Wolanin.
[14:23.670 --> 14:26.050]  We've been up since about like 4 in the morning.
[14:26.230 --> 14:26.810]  Yeah, I'm gonna save that.
[14:27.310 --> 14:27.710]  For a little tie-tie.
[14:27.770 --> 14:28.450]  It's been a long day.
[14:28.770 --> 14:32.990]  But that's okay, because we're desperate to come here and spend the next hour with y'all.
[14:33.250 --> 14:36.390]  We've scheduled our flight so we could be here for this.
[14:36.430 --> 14:36.870]  It's true.
[14:37.010 --> 14:39.350]  We have another autograph, on-card autograph, it looks like.
[14:39.350 --> 14:41.710]  This is a rookie card.
[14:42.770 --> 14:44.470]  2002 Atlanta Braves.
[14:44.990 --> 14:46.730]  This is Tim Spooniebarger.
[14:50.070 --> 14:50.670]  Spooniebarger?
[14:50.890 --> 14:53.710]  Matt has really upped our funny name game.
[14:54.150 --> 14:54.750]  Spooniebarger.
[14:55.010 --> 14:56.170]  Spooniebarger and Boof.
[14:57.450 --> 14:58.770]  Boof and Spoonie.
[14:59.330 --> 15:00.310]  That's really great.
[15:00.410 --> 15:01.510]  And then one more card.
[15:02.050 --> 15:03.790]  This is Urban Shocker Baseball.
[15:03.890 --> 15:04.790]  This is Goodwin Champions.
[15:05.050 --> 15:05.570]  It's a mini-card.
[15:05.650 --> 15:08.290]  Goodwin Champions is Upper Deck's version of Allen and Ginter.
[15:08.290 --> 15:09.450]  Yeah, they look like the same.
[15:09.550 --> 15:09.810]  They're very similar.
[15:09.870 --> 15:11.010]  Are they called tobacco cards?
[15:11.230 --> 15:12.470]  Yeah, they are called tobacco cards.
[15:12.490 --> 15:13.050]  Look at me.
[15:13.130 --> 15:14.010]  Fucking hell, look at you.
[15:14.110 --> 15:14.430]  I know.
[15:14.790 --> 15:16.070]  This is Urban Shocker.
[15:16.150 --> 15:17.150]  Oh, I guess that's his name.
[15:19.350 --> 15:19.990]  Urban Shocker.
[15:20.030 --> 15:21.090]  I thought that was a sex thing.
[15:21.370 --> 15:21.690]  Wow.
[15:21.850 --> 15:22.930]  Oh my god.
[15:23.610 --> 15:24.250]  That's great.
[15:24.390 --> 15:24.890]  Look at that.
[15:25.010 --> 15:25.670]  That's so cool.
[15:25.990 --> 15:27.770]  He must have played a billion years ago.
[15:27.890 --> 15:29.190]  What does it say about him?
[15:29.530 --> 15:31.710]  It says something, but it's too small for Geoff to read.
[15:31.810 --> 15:32.890]  Hold on, let me lift this up and see.
[15:32.890 --> 15:40.110]  It says, in his final season before heart trouble ended his career...
[15:40.110 --> 15:42.250]  I wonder if he got the shockers.
[15:42.670 --> 15:42.970]  Paddles.
[15:44.580 --> 15:49.690]  He pitched for champion New York in 1927.
[15:49.990 --> 15:52.070]  Piling an 18-6 record.
[15:52.870 --> 15:53.550]  That's pretty good.
[15:53.690 --> 15:55.830]  With a 2.34 ERA.
[15:56.010 --> 15:57.090]  That's pretty fucking good.
[15:57.230 --> 16:00.290]  And 35 strikeouts in 200 innings.
[16:00.430 --> 16:02.150]  Over 31 games.
[16:02.150 --> 16:03.850]  Good for you, Urban Shocker.
[16:04.030 --> 16:05.450]  What were you doing in 1927?
[16:06.470 --> 16:07.470]  I got my driver's license.
[16:07.590 --> 16:08.930]  Hey, that's nice.
[16:09.890 --> 16:11.650]  Now that we're through with that, what should we open?
[16:11.650 --> 16:12.750]  Do you want to open up a little Alan and Ginter?
[16:12.990 --> 16:13.130]  Yeah.
[16:13.410 --> 16:16.890]  Now this box has already been opened, so we're not going to have a box topper in it.
[16:16.950 --> 16:17.550]  But what if...
[16:17.550 --> 16:18.530]  But we'll open some packs.
[16:18.830 --> 16:19.110]  Yeah.
[16:19.330 --> 16:21.690]  What if we did one to see if we have a box topper?
[16:21.810 --> 16:26.270]  What if we do one to see if we have a box topper before the end of the episode?
[16:26.330 --> 16:26.530]  Yeah.
[16:26.950 --> 16:27.590]  What if we...
[16:28.170 --> 16:29.290]  Actually, you know what I want to do?
[16:29.350 --> 16:30.150]  I want to hold off...
[16:30.150 --> 16:31.170]  We've got a lot of stuff.
[16:31.170 --> 16:34.730]  I don't want to open up any of the Hit Parade stuff, because we've got footballs and mini bats.
[16:34.790 --> 16:35.470]  I want to wait for Eric for that.
[16:35.490 --> 16:35.670]  Yeah.
[16:36.290 --> 16:38.970]  But I've been holding onto this bad boy for a while, and I want to open this.
[16:39.350 --> 16:42.990]  This is 2021 Pieces of the Past, historical edition.
[16:43.690 --> 16:44.190]  That's right.
[16:44.250 --> 16:51.130]  We could get a Babe Ruth, a John F. Kennedy, an Abraham Lincoln, a Sitting Bull, an MLK Jr., a George Washington relic.
[16:51.350 --> 16:51.570]  Dang.
[16:51.630 --> 16:53.410]  I think you can get one of his wooden teeth in here.
[16:53.410 --> 16:53.650]  Nah.
[16:53.870 --> 16:55.270]  That's like a sliver of his wooden teeth.
[16:55.450 --> 16:56.650]  So we'll open this at the very end.
[16:56.690 --> 16:57.750]  This will be our big chase.
[16:57.770 --> 16:59.370]  So there is a relic in there for sure.
[17:00.490 --> 17:04.890]  It says two hits per box. Relics, one of ones, or autos.
[17:05.150 --> 17:08.230]  That either one is of any of that stuff? That's cool.
[17:08.370 --> 17:13.630]  Well, there's a 410-card checklist, so there's probably one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight A-listers,
[17:14.010 --> 17:17.430]  and then a bunch of dudes you've never heard of from the 1920s, probably.
[17:17.450 --> 17:20.050]  But it could be a piece of Beethoven's sheet music.
[17:20.750 --> 17:22.630]  Oh, yeah, it could be a piece of Beethoven's sheet music.
[17:22.630 --> 17:26.270]  It could be Benjamin Franklin's, the key that he used to find electricity.
[17:26.690 --> 17:27.190]  It might be.
[17:27.370 --> 17:28.670]  It could be. It could be anything.
[17:28.670 --> 17:31.750]  We'll find out in about 30 minutes.
[17:31.870 --> 17:32.070]  Yeah.
[17:32.230 --> 17:34.550]  All right, let's see what we've got going on in these Alan and Gingers, though.
[17:34.690 --> 17:36.350]  So we already got our Jet Ski card.
[17:36.970 --> 17:39.090]  We're still looking for a Falcon.
[17:39.370 --> 17:40.190]  We're still looking for Falcon.
[17:40.590 --> 17:41.850]  Here's a Mike Trout.
[17:44.350 --> 17:45.150]  JT Realmuto.
[17:46.230 --> 17:47.030]  Senga Otto.
[17:47.730 --> 17:48.430]  That's Kodai Senga.
[17:48.650 --> 17:49.570]  Let's go ahead and...
[17:49.570 --> 17:50.270]  Manny Machado.
[17:51.470 --> 17:52.990]  Oh, here we have somebody who's not...
[17:52.990 --> 17:53.790]  Sarah Langs.
[17:54.190 --> 17:55.770]  She's a reporter and a researcher.
[17:56.230 --> 17:56.570]  Cool.
[17:56.750 --> 17:57.350]  MLB reporter.
[17:57.350 --> 17:58.430]  There we go.
[17:58.730 --> 18:01.610]  Here we have Maglio Ordonez.
[18:01.850 --> 18:05.350]  Our mini card is Nathan Dogface...
[18:06.490 --> 18:07.010]  Dogface.
[18:07.130 --> 18:09.590]  ...of Opadoka, the Vibe King.
[18:09.890 --> 18:11.950]  Oh, he's the one that did the...
[18:11.950 --> 18:13.250]  Oh, he's the guy with the skateboard.
[18:13.530 --> 18:13.610]  He was skateboarding with the...
[18:13.610 --> 18:14.570]  He skateboards to Fleetwood Mac.
[18:14.630 --> 18:14.830]  Yeah.
[18:15.350 --> 18:17.310]  Oh, yeah, he drinks, like, orange juice and skateboard longboards.
[18:17.310 --> 18:18.250]  He drinks cranberry juice.
[18:18.270 --> 18:18.650]  Yeah.
[18:18.850 --> 18:19.750]  Healthy UTI system.
[18:19.750 --> 18:23.350]  Oh, I bet he's very healthy with his eliminations.
[18:24.090 --> 18:24.270]  Yeah.
[18:24.730 --> 18:25.330]  That's great.
[18:25.570 --> 18:25.930]  I like that.
[18:25.930 --> 18:27.190]  I'm pro Vibe King.
[18:27.430 --> 18:30.590]  Alan and Ginter is very into TikTok people.
[18:30.670 --> 18:31.170]  Yeah, they are.
[18:31.390 --> 18:32.330]  Well, they're all...
[18:32.850 --> 18:33.250]  Everybody...
[18:33.250 --> 18:34.250]  Baseball's big in TikTok.
[18:34.770 --> 18:35.530]  They're all just...
[18:36.290 --> 18:38.010]  Justin Verlander, first career no-hitter.
[18:38.290 --> 18:39.510]  He's married to Kate Upton.
[18:39.910 --> 18:41.210]  They are still married together, yeah.
[18:41.430 --> 18:42.850]  He no longer plays for Detroit.
[18:43.010 --> 18:44.530]  He plays for us way back in 2007.
[18:44.810 --> 18:45.590]  He's back with Houston.
[18:45.830 --> 18:50.530]  He left Houston to go to the New York Mets for a bunch of money, and then it was a dumpster fire.
[18:50.710 --> 18:52.390]  And so he ran back to Houston.
[18:52.550 --> 18:53.990]  How long was he not in Houston?
[18:54.030 --> 18:54.830]  I thought he's always been in Houston.
[18:54.890 --> 18:55.910]  One year, I think.
[18:55.910 --> 18:57.470]  Was that just recently that he came back?
[18:57.470 --> 18:57.910]  Yeah, last year.
[18:58.010 --> 18:58.190]  Oh.
[18:58.550 --> 18:59.330]  He came back this year.
[19:00.230 --> 19:00.990]  Are they any better now?
[19:00.990 --> 19:02.490]  I think he came back at the trade deadline.
[19:02.630 --> 19:03.510]  I think he got traded back.
[19:03.690 --> 19:04.290]  Oh, okay.
[19:05.510 --> 19:06.570]  Anna Lee Waters.
[19:07.650 --> 19:09.570]  She appears to play tennis, I would guess.
[19:09.690 --> 19:10.030]  Let me see.
[19:10.930 --> 19:12.310]  Professional pickleball player.
[19:13.070 --> 19:13.430]  Now...
[19:13.430 --> 19:14.010]  How did I know?
[19:14.670 --> 19:16.130]  We need to get back out in the pickleball.
[19:16.130 --> 19:17.830]  How do we become professional pickleball players?
[19:17.890 --> 19:19.570]  Because I feel like we've got a shot.
[19:20.430 --> 19:21.470]  We're pretty good.
[19:21.490 --> 19:22.050]  We're pretty good.
[19:22.090 --> 19:22.790]  We're pretty good.
[19:22.950 --> 19:25.070]  I haven't played in a while because it's 300 degrees in Texas.
[19:26.110 --> 19:26.510]  Oops.
[19:27.330 --> 19:28.030]  Tommy Henry.
[19:28.550 --> 19:29.430]  Rookie base, rookie card.
[19:29.590 --> 19:30.170]  Let's do that.
[19:31.230 --> 19:35.190]  Here we have professional wiffleball player, Tommy Coughlin.
[19:35.370 --> 19:36.030]  Okay, again.
[19:37.530 --> 19:41.110]  Professional wiffleball players have a card, but you don't have a card.
[19:42.030 --> 19:44.590]  I need to get Alan or Ginter on the horn.
[19:44.690 --> 19:45.810]  Dude, we're about to have...
[19:45.810 --> 19:48.150]  We're just about to hit city here, Emily.
[19:48.950 --> 19:50.110]  I'm very excited about this.
[19:50.130 --> 19:51.550]  Gotta figure out how to make money on this!
[19:51.630 --> 19:52.790]  I really want to!
[19:52.930 --> 19:54.270]  First off, we get a Coughlin mini.
[19:54.270 --> 19:55.270]  A double...
[19:57.110 --> 20:00.290]  We have Alejandro Kirk for the Blue Jays.
[20:00.430 --> 20:02.470]  Then we have... check out this bad boy...
[20:03.170 --> 20:03.650]  Snorkeling!
[20:05.570 --> 20:06.530]  You know...
[20:06.530 --> 20:07.590]  We went snorkeling.
[20:07.790 --> 20:09.850]  We snorkeled the shipwreck just this weekend.
[20:10.410 --> 20:11.250]  We did.
[20:11.390 --> 20:14.270]  And I didn't want to touch any of it because it looked super gross.
[20:14.330 --> 20:17.490]  And it was covered in birds that were just squawking at us.
[20:17.510 --> 20:19.330]  And we have an official...
[20:19.330 --> 20:20.530]  You don't get these very often.
[20:23.130 --> 20:24.090]  Autograph of...
[20:24.090 --> 20:25.530]  And I'm going to hope you know who this is.
[20:25.650 --> 20:27.710]  Sarah Natochinny, the actress!
[20:29.690 --> 20:30.570]  Sarah Natochinny.
[20:30.690 --> 20:31.350]  She's an actress.
[20:31.830 --> 20:33.050]  That's her on-card auto.
[20:33.570 --> 20:34.090]  It says...
[20:35.730 --> 20:38.190]  Bearing the signature of Sarah Natochinny.
[20:38.490 --> 20:38.830]  Actor.
[20:40.310 --> 20:41.550]  What has she been in?
[20:41.670 --> 20:42.810]  What has she been in?
[20:43.270 --> 20:45.470]  If you're in the chat, you can let me know.
[20:47.410 --> 20:47.850]  Natochinny.
[20:49.110 --> 20:51.030]  Their autos are like laminated.
[20:51.030 --> 20:55.110]  Yeah, well, they autograph the mini-card and then they encase it.
[20:56.230 --> 20:56.710]  Wow.
[20:57.310 --> 20:57.830]  It's really pretty.
[20:58.250 --> 20:58.730]  It's really cool.
[20:59.090 --> 21:00.890]  It's a beautiful card.
[21:01.310 --> 21:02.510]  Yeah, it is a beautiful card.
[21:03.150 --> 21:04.270]  Yeah, Emily, it is.
[21:06.330 --> 21:07.930]  Francisco Alvarez, bass rookie.
[21:08.730 --> 21:10.790]  Oh, here we have Chris Fowler, sports podcaster.
[21:13.250 --> 21:14.790]  Matthew Libitore, rookie.
[21:15.750 --> 21:16.910]  We have Jeremy Pena.
[21:19.330 --> 21:21.290]  Not the... Sarah... Wow.
[21:21.850 --> 21:24.570]  Cedric Mullins has crazy eyes in this picture.
[21:24.830 --> 21:27.970]  Do you remember Crazy Eyes Killer from Kirby Enthusiasm?
[21:28.550 --> 21:29.030]  The rapper.
[21:29.410 --> 21:30.110]  He's kind of got the same eyes.
[21:30.110 --> 21:30.690]  He does.
[21:30.810 --> 21:31.670]  He's kind of a crazy eyes killer.
[21:33.050 --> 21:34.090]  Jose Ramirez.
[21:34.430 --> 21:35.410]  He's clapping, he's happy.
[21:36.410 --> 21:37.990]  Then we have Eric Gagney.
[21:38.390 --> 21:42.430]  Oh, this chat is saying that she's someone that voiced...
[21:43.330 --> 21:45.210]  English club of Pokemon.
[21:46.010 --> 21:46.670]  Excuse me?
[21:46.790 --> 21:48.210]  She's a Pokemon voice actor?
[21:48.450 --> 21:50.630]  She is the voice of Ash Ketchum.
[21:51.250 --> 21:52.890]  That's the main character on the Pokemon.
[21:53.410 --> 21:54.650]  The little boy with the hat.
[21:55.090 --> 21:56.530]  And he's got to catch them all.
[21:56.610 --> 21:57.670]  And he's got like a vest, I think.
[21:57.750 --> 21:58.410]  That could be something.
[21:58.430 --> 21:59.970]  So that's the Pokemon boy.
[22:00.630 --> 22:01.850]  Okay, that could be something.
[22:02.170 --> 22:02.830]  I bet it is.
[22:02.930 --> 22:03.390]  I bet it's fucking...
[22:03.910 --> 22:04.790]  I bet it's got value.
[22:04.850 --> 22:05.250]  Wow.
[22:05.710 --> 22:06.970]  Oh, she's Vera in Camp Camp.
[22:07.510 --> 22:08.830]  Oh, shit, she's in Rooster Teeth.
[22:09.230 --> 22:10.250]  Oh, yeah, her.
[22:11.270 --> 22:12.070]  Oh, yeah.
[22:12.310 --> 22:13.990]  I think I saw her in the hallway earlier.
[22:13.990 --> 22:14.870]  Rooster Teeth's own.
[22:15.250 --> 22:15.510]  Yeah.
[22:15.830 --> 22:17.010]  Oh, Sarah.
[22:18.130 --> 22:18.590]  I couldn't...
[22:18.590 --> 22:20.390]  You know, it's on such a little card, I couldn't tell.
[22:20.410 --> 22:21.190]  Yeah, there you go.
[22:21.310 --> 22:22.470]  Well, that's fucking...
[22:22.470 --> 22:25.450]  Also Ash Ketchum, I guess, but mostly from Camp Camp.
[22:25.550 --> 22:26.250]  Yeah, that's great.
[22:26.470 --> 22:26.510]  Yeah.
[22:26.750 --> 22:28.470]  New episodes of Camp Camp next year, I believe.
[22:28.710 --> 22:29.090]  Tune in.
[22:29.190 --> 22:29.390]  Yeah.
[22:29.510 --> 22:29.990]  I think, yeah.
[22:30.010 --> 22:31.370]  Get your first membership, I think.
[22:31.410 --> 22:31.730]  I don't know.
[22:32.310 --> 22:32.890]  Good call.
[22:33.050 --> 22:33.690]  Good call on that one.
[22:34.350 --> 22:35.650]  Save room for dessert.
[22:35.910 --> 22:36.290]  Oh, that, yeah.
[22:36.290 --> 22:36.970]  Ice cream sundae.
[22:37.150 --> 22:37.730]  That's what's up.
[22:37.850 --> 22:38.790]  That is what's up.
[22:38.870 --> 22:39.390]  We'll sleeve the menu.
[22:39.390 --> 22:40.810]  They don't have...
[22:40.810 --> 22:43.310]  You know, I feel like...
[22:43.310 --> 22:46.310]  I don't know if it's a small town thing, and like maybe Austin has gotten too big, but
[22:46.310 --> 22:50.450]  there's not any, like, other than Amy's, but that's not like an ice cream parlor, where
[22:50.450 --> 22:54.070]  you go and get your dessert served in a classic thing like that.
[22:54.370 --> 22:54.950]  You know what?
[22:55.130 --> 22:57.930]  I think it's a glaring hole that we have in Texas.
[22:58.070 --> 23:01.910]  When I lived on the East Coast, they had a place called Friendly's, and you would...
[23:01.910 --> 23:04.990]  It was like a restaurant, but it was mostly dessert, and you would go there to get like
[23:04.990 --> 23:07.130]  the big fucking, like, exorbitant...
[23:07.130 --> 23:07.230]  Yeah.
[23:07.230 --> 23:08.590]  Maybe there's like a sparkler in it, you know?
[23:08.630 --> 23:08.950]  Yeah.
[23:09.390 --> 23:10.610]  We don't really have that here.
[23:10.710 --> 23:12.930]  No, like it's like a classic ice cream parlor.
[23:12.930 --> 23:14.770]  Second year card, Julio Rodriguez.
[23:15.070 --> 23:15.590]  J-Rod.
[23:16.090 --> 23:18.750]  Ozzy Smith, best flipper in the history of baseball.
[23:18.890 --> 23:19.070]  Flipper?
[23:19.550 --> 23:20.750]  Yeah, he did backflips.
[23:20.830 --> 23:21.330]  Oh, cool.
[23:22.750 --> 23:25.530]  There's somebody named Gabriel Moreno.
[23:26.090 --> 23:29.250]  There you go, for the D-backs, it looks like.
[23:29.490 --> 23:30.590]  Probably in the playoffs right now.
[23:30.710 --> 23:30.870]  Yeah.
[23:31.150 --> 23:32.950]  Kicking the shit out of the Dodgers.
[23:33.250 --> 23:33.530]  Yeah.
[23:33.670 --> 23:33.950]  9-2.
[23:34.330 --> 23:36.910]  Yeah, that game wasn't their best performance.
[23:36.990 --> 23:38.030]  That was not cool.
[23:38.030 --> 23:39.050]  Jose Altuve.
[23:40.370 --> 23:41.270]  Nico Horner.
[23:42.850 --> 23:47.550]  We got a rookie mini for Oscar Colas for the White Sox.
[23:47.910 --> 23:50.010]  Boy, this is a real dark time for the White Sox.
[23:50.550 --> 23:52.010]  Okay, that answers my question.
[23:52.510 --> 23:56.230]  It's been so bad. I've been a White Sox fan since 1987.
[23:56.590 --> 23:56.830]  Uh-huh.
[23:57.710 --> 24:03.630]  And I'm considering trading in a lateral move to the Tigers.
[24:03.870 --> 24:04.090]  Yeah.
[24:04.090 --> 24:07.010]  Because if I'll be living in or around Michigan anyway,
[24:07.010 --> 24:09.870]  and the teams are just as shitty as each other.
[24:09.970 --> 24:10.850]  They've got a great look.
[24:11.030 --> 24:12.770]  I mean, the Sox is a good logo.
[24:13.350 --> 24:14.010]  It's a great logo.
[24:14.730 --> 24:17.430]  But the D on the Detroit logo is good.
[24:17.490 --> 24:19.190]  And the different Tigers that they've had.
[24:19.610 --> 24:21.170]  The cracked-out Tiger, yeah.
[24:21.270 --> 24:22.470]  I like the cracked-out Tiger.
[24:22.970 --> 24:23.890]  Surf's up, dude.
[24:24.750 --> 24:25.550]  Dude, Cowabunga.
[24:25.990 --> 24:26.150]  Fun in the Sun.
[24:26.310 --> 24:27.590]  I really like these Fun in the Sun inserts.
[24:28.090 --> 24:28.450]  I like that.
[24:28.670 --> 24:29.810]  This is cool.
[24:29.910 --> 24:30.290]  Urmsi.
[24:31.210 --> 24:31.510]  What?
[24:31.570 --> 24:32.090]  He's an artist.
[24:32.090 --> 24:32.850]  Oh.
[24:33.030 --> 24:33.630]  That's his card.
[24:33.990 --> 24:34.350]  Wow.
[24:34.570 --> 24:35.190]  That's pretty cool, too.
[24:35.470 --> 24:35.830]  All right.
[24:36.370 --> 24:37.870]  Why don't we hop on over?
[24:37.990 --> 24:38.390]  I have a...
[24:38.390 --> 24:39.210]  I found these.
[24:39.610 --> 24:40.390]  I don't know where they came from.
[24:40.430 --> 24:41.810]  I got a couple of recon packs.
[24:41.910 --> 24:42.350]  This is NBA.
[24:42.550 --> 24:43.690]  It's 2022, 2023.
[24:45.150 --> 24:46.350]  Steph Curry on the cover.
[24:46.750 --> 24:49.850]  We're looking for some badass rookies.
[24:50.310 --> 24:51.470]  Off the...
[24:51.470 --> 24:53.770]  Right out the gate, we have a Jalen Duren.
[24:55.050 --> 24:56.990]  Rock the Rim rookie insert.
[24:57.070 --> 25:00.090]  We'll sleeve that, although it remains to be seen if Jalen Duren's gonna...
[25:00.090 --> 25:02.770]  Would this have Wembenyama in it?
[25:02.890 --> 25:03.290]  Wembenyama?
[25:03.530 --> 25:03.930]  No.
[25:04.230 --> 25:05.290]  No, it won't have him in it.
[25:05.910 --> 25:11.550]  Buddy Heald, gold number 39 to 299, I believe.
[25:12.190 --> 25:12.910]  There you go.
[25:13.550 --> 25:15.390]  Jabari Walker, bass rookie.
[25:15.670 --> 25:16.670]  That's a pretty card.
[25:16.790 --> 25:20.850]  These cards are so hard to keep in good shape.
[25:21.130 --> 25:21.690]  Kevin Harter.
[25:22.090 --> 25:23.750]  I don't have...
[25:23.750 --> 25:25.010]  Is it bad to put him in this?
[25:25.210 --> 25:25.390]  Yeah.
[25:25.490 --> 25:26.210]  Oh, do you need more sleeves?
[25:26.230 --> 25:26.830]  Oh, yeah, I do.
[25:26.910 --> 25:27.410]  I have tons.
[25:27.590 --> 25:27.990]  Thank you.
[25:28.430 --> 25:29.450]  A billion, here.
[25:30.270 --> 25:32.270]  Just as I was thinking, I'll just put him in this.
[25:32.590 --> 25:34.390]  You're saying how hard it is to keep him in good shape.
[25:34.590 --> 25:36.110]  Yeah, no, we'll put him in the good stuff.
[25:36.950 --> 25:38.530]  Donovan Mitchell, Spider Mitchell.
[25:38.990 --> 25:42.170]  Only spider-related nickname in the NBA that I'm aware of, except for the tarantula.
[25:42.570 --> 25:43.190]  So I guess there's two.
[25:43.550 --> 25:45.210]  And then Chris Duarte.
[25:45.550 --> 25:47.130]  No spider-related nicknames for him.
[25:48.130 --> 25:48.950]  One more pack.
[25:49.210 --> 25:49.730]  Yeah, please.
[25:50.470 --> 25:53.310]  This is from a hobby box, so we're getting better hits.
[25:53.370 --> 25:55.670]  These are thicker than usual.
[25:56.410 --> 25:58.090]  Jalen Suggs, future Legends card.
[25:58.390 --> 25:59.630]  His friends call him Suggie.
[25:59.930 --> 26:00.910]  That's a good name.
[26:00.990 --> 26:02.230]  I don't know if that's true, I made that up.
[26:02.350 --> 26:03.550]  I just like Suggs.
[26:04.410 --> 26:04.850]  Suggs.
[26:05.730 --> 26:06.710]  What are you doing over there?
[26:06.810 --> 26:07.350]  I'm sugging.
[26:07.490 --> 26:08.070]  I'm just sugging.
[26:09.350 --> 26:11.750]  Harrison Barnes, numbered 40-199.
[26:12.370 --> 26:13.830]  I think he just re-signed to Sacramento.
[26:16.910 --> 26:19.210]  Oh, it's a hit city today.
[26:19.270 --> 26:19.530]  Yeah?
[26:20.010 --> 26:20.470]  Sort of.
[26:21.010 --> 26:22.630]  Christian Coloco, base rookie.
[26:22.950 --> 26:23.730]  That's nice.
[26:25.050 --> 26:26.750]  Tim Hardaway Jr.
[26:27.570 --> 26:27.810]  Yeah?
[26:28.270 --> 26:28.690]  Yeah.
[26:29.070 --> 26:29.790]  And then...
[26:30.850 --> 26:32.550]  I was going to say something mean about his dad, but I won't.
[26:32.810 --> 26:34.470]  Brandon Clark, base card.
[26:34.570 --> 26:36.150]  Brandon Clark's dad or Christian's dad?
[26:36.310 --> 26:36.810]  Tim Hardaway.
[26:37.930 --> 26:42.850]  And then, Brooke Lopez, number 9 of 10.
[26:43.630 --> 26:45.330]  Dang, dang, I recognize that guy.
[26:45.390 --> 26:45.730]  Call of Excellence.
[26:46.610 --> 26:51.130]  Brooke Lopez, fucking number 10 auto.
[26:51.310 --> 26:53.390]  It's not on card, but I don't think any of these are.
[26:54.170 --> 26:55.370]  That's really, really cool.
[26:55.590 --> 26:56.710]  He plays for the Bucs.
[26:56.750 --> 26:57.690]  He's a center for the Bucs.
[26:57.750 --> 26:59.950]  His brother, he's got a twin brother named Robin Lopez.
[27:00.210 --> 27:00.670]  Does he have the hair?
[27:00.870 --> 27:02.510]  He's the one with the Sideshow Bob hair.
[27:03.150 --> 27:03.610]  Yeah, okay.
[27:03.830 --> 27:05.790]  And they're both very good players.
[27:05.910 --> 27:06.870]  He's probably better.
[27:07.690 --> 27:12.890]  He's a rare breed of center in the NBA who's gotten better in his 30s than he was in his 20s.
[27:13.010 --> 27:16.890]  And he's kind of hit a point where he's getting better every year, which can't last forever.
[27:17.130 --> 27:19.670]  And I think maybe this might be the year that it stops, but...
[27:20.270 --> 27:21.310]  Or that he plateaus.
[27:22.690 --> 27:25.030]  But he's been very impressive the last few years.
[27:25.150 --> 27:28.670]  Definitely one of the best defensive centers and one of the most underrated centers in basketball.
[27:29.270 --> 27:31.190]  And a big cartoon fan.
[27:31.510 --> 27:32.110]  Oh, like what kind?
[27:32.170 --> 27:32.890]  Like Disney.
[27:33.530 --> 27:38.390]  He and his brother are both big Disney fans.
[27:38.530 --> 27:38.750]  Okay.
[27:39.250 --> 27:44.030]  Do you think that he's a little bit better than his brother because of the aerodynamics of the hair?
[27:44.230 --> 27:44.790]  Yeah, I think probably.
[27:45.170 --> 27:48.410]  Here's one of those packs of 91 Fleer Ultra Football that Millie got me.
[27:48.710 --> 27:49.510]  Oh, yeah.
[27:49.910 --> 27:50.190]  Yeah.
[27:51.310 --> 27:52.230]  It's my sweet kid.
[27:52.330 --> 27:52.850]  She loves me.
[27:53.450 --> 27:57.070]  I'm sorry I dropped it, but it's in its sleeve.
[27:57.210 --> 27:58.750]  And it's fine.
[28:01.190 --> 28:03.050]  I'm so sorry.
[28:05.750 --> 28:06.930]  Stephon Page.
[28:07.930 --> 28:09.010]  Here's a good name.
[28:09.150 --> 28:10.090]  Bubby Brister.
[28:10.550 --> 28:11.770]  Oh, Bubby.
[28:12.110 --> 28:13.210]  Let's save that.
[28:13.830 --> 28:14.890]  Gil Bird.
[28:15.230 --> 28:15.950]  Name's an animal.
[28:16.430 --> 28:16.650]  Yep.
[28:17.870 --> 28:21.110]  Here we have Derek Finner, who is apparently a Seahawks running back.
[28:21.970 --> 28:22.930]  Trace Armstrong.
[28:25.070 --> 28:26.750]  Tim Harris, famous packer.
[28:27.850 --> 28:28.790]  Wilbur Marshall.
[28:29.510 --> 28:31.310]  We have Chris Dolman.
[28:32.310 --> 28:33.270]  Toy Cook.
[28:33.550 --> 28:33.870]  Toy?
[28:34.150 --> 28:34.430]  Toy.
[28:34.670 --> 28:35.230]  Oh, I thought...
[28:35.230 --> 28:36.670]  Oh, we talked about this guy not too long ago.
[28:37.170 --> 28:38.930]  Dan McGuire was Seahawks quarterback.
[28:39.090 --> 28:40.950]  Remember, Eric and I were talking about him a couple weeks ago?
[28:41.210 --> 28:42.630]  He's Mark McGuire's brother.
[28:42.870 --> 28:43.410]  Oh, really?
[28:43.710 --> 28:43.970]  He was a quarterback.
[28:44.050 --> 28:45.090]  Didn't play very long.
[28:45.090 --> 28:46.410]  He was, like, 6'7".
[28:46.410 --> 28:47.630]  He was really fucking tall.
[28:47.710 --> 28:48.610]  He smells McGuire different.
[28:48.710 --> 28:49.470]  I just noticed that.
[28:49.550 --> 28:50.410]  Yeah, McGuire.
[28:51.030 --> 28:52.190]  Yeah, 6'8".
[28:52.190 --> 28:52.590]  Wow.
[28:52.790 --> 28:54.370]  Yeah, he didn't last too long.
[28:54.450 --> 28:55.130]  We'll just leave that, though.
[28:55.150 --> 28:55.790]  It's his rookie card.
[28:56.210 --> 28:59.750]  Did he go into, like, playing sports before his...
[28:59.750 --> 29:00.330]  Like, is he older?
[29:00.590 --> 29:01.430]  I think he's younger.
[29:01.730 --> 29:03.790]  So, Mark McGuire was already playing.
[29:04.050 --> 29:06.490]  Yeah, McGuire hit baseball in, like, 86, 87.
[29:06.690 --> 29:08.430]  I think that's 90, 91 he came in.
[29:09.270 --> 29:10.890]  Pepper Johnson, name's a food.
[29:10.970 --> 29:11.170]  Yep.
[29:12.550 --> 29:13.350]  Randall Cunningham.
[29:14.290 --> 29:21.890]  Randall Cunningham, single-handedly responsible for me not doing fantasy football for many, many years.
[29:22.190 --> 29:22.550]  Why?
[29:22.550 --> 29:26.050]  I went all in on Randall Cunningham one year, and he fucked me so hard.
[29:26.230 --> 29:27.530]  I was a big Randall Cunningham fan.
[29:27.750 --> 29:29.130]  But I was just like, I'm not doing this anymore.
[29:29.150 --> 29:30.330]  Like, he...
[29:30.330 --> 29:31.730]  He's had a terrible season.
[29:32.490 --> 29:33.250]  And I put...
[29:33.250 --> 29:34.150]  Is this in 90?
[29:34.790 --> 29:36.390]  Yeah, this is in the late...
[29:36.390 --> 29:37.270]  He played for a while.
[29:37.390 --> 29:38.710]  It was probably mid to late 90s.
[29:38.750 --> 29:42.250]  Would you say that Randall Cunningham is the first enemy of The Break Show?
[29:42.790 --> 29:43.330]  No.
[29:44.810 --> 29:46.070]  No, we've got a lot.
[29:47.370 --> 29:50.210]  Kevin Feigen, and then Michael Koffer.
[29:50.550 --> 29:51.190]  There you go.
[29:53.750 --> 29:54.290]  Name...
[29:54.290 --> 29:55.530]  Name is a symptom.
[29:55.930 --> 29:56.320]  Name is...
[29:58.490 --> 30:02.250]  Speaking of coughing, people in the airports are gross.
[30:02.770 --> 30:04.610]  People in the airport are gross.
[30:06.670 --> 30:08.210]  What should we open up next, Emily?
[30:08.470 --> 30:09.770]  I wanna do...
[30:09.770 --> 30:11.430]  You wanna do a Dallas Pack, or should we wait that for...
[30:12.070 --> 30:16.730]  I know, I wanna open it to talk about it with you, but then if we wait till Eric, we can look at his face.
[30:17.010 --> 30:17.690]  I think that...
[30:17.690 --> 30:22.670]  Well, I think that if we don't do it with Eric, like, he's not gonna know what's happening in the story.
[30:23.030 --> 30:26.390]  Like, he's still gonna think that Bobby and Pam are okay, but they're not.
[30:26.450 --> 30:27.250]  Oh my God.
[30:27.250 --> 30:28.410]  He's not gonna...
[30:28.410 --> 30:30.210]  He's not gonna know...
[30:30.210 --> 30:32.810]  He doesn't even know that Pamela...
[30:32.810 --> 30:37.530]  Like, she's fully aware now that she's actually the one that's in control of Boogus Ewing Oil.
[30:37.630 --> 30:39.790]  What is Pamela's fucking problem?
[30:40.230 --> 30:41.630]  It's probably something to do with her haircut.
[30:41.830 --> 30:42.290]  In season six.
[30:42.310 --> 30:42.670]  I don't know.
[30:42.970 --> 30:44.550]  She has gone off the deep end.
[30:44.750 --> 30:45.210]  I just...
[30:45.210 --> 30:49.890]  The thing I love throughout this whole show is that they're like, oh, I have to be with my child.
[30:50.010 --> 30:52.470]  And then they'll be like, here, Teresa, take Christopher.
[30:52.790 --> 30:56.470]  Like, they hold their baby for like a second, and then they're like, get it away from me.
[30:56.470 --> 30:57.650]  And they're like, put it to bed now.
[30:57.750 --> 30:57.890]  Yeah.
[30:58.610 --> 31:00.550]  It's like, don't refer to your kid as an it, first of all.
[31:00.550 --> 31:00.750]  Yeah.
[31:00.850 --> 31:02.290]  But I guess that's what we did in the 80s.
[31:02.810 --> 31:03.610]  Oh, how about this?
[31:04.050 --> 31:04.850]  You wanna get a little...
[31:04.850 --> 31:05.470]  Have some fun?
[31:05.550 --> 31:06.310]  We'll open up a Disney.
[31:06.590 --> 31:06.730]  Yeah.
[31:06.750 --> 31:07.490]  Some Disney stuff.
[31:07.490 --> 31:07.830]  Yeah.
[31:09.710 --> 31:11.830]  Would you say that you're a Disney adult?
[31:12.550 --> 31:13.150]  I wouldn't.
[31:13.590 --> 31:14.170]  No, I would not.
[31:14.190 --> 31:15.010]  You wouldn't admit it?
[31:15.350 --> 31:17.050]  No, I wouldn't say it because it's not true.
[31:17.730 --> 31:20.030]  I've enjoyed going to Disney with you.
[31:20.210 --> 31:21.490]  Going to Disney...
[31:22.250 --> 31:23.510]  Yeah, I don't think that we're...
[31:23.510 --> 31:30.450]  We're not Disney adults, but we're adults that enjoy Disney and going to Disney parks without children rules.
[31:30.730 --> 31:31.890]  Jack is a Disney adult.
[31:32.390 --> 31:32.590]  Yeah.
[31:33.030 --> 31:33.390]  All right.
[31:33.430 --> 31:33.710]  Here we go.
[31:33.730 --> 31:34.750]  We got a bunch of these packs.
[31:35.230 --> 31:36.770]  We'll save one for the pack sack.
[31:37.410 --> 31:39.670]  And maybe we'll save some for next time.
[31:39.710 --> 31:39.890]  Yeah.
[31:39.990 --> 31:40.750]  We'll open...
[31:41.370 --> 31:42.450]  Let's open those three.
[31:42.670 --> 31:45.770]  It's crazy that Jack doesn't wanna ever come on the show.
[31:46.110 --> 31:49.750]  Yeah, he scheduled his own streaming stuff, so he can't.
[31:50.410 --> 31:50.570]  Yeah.
[31:50.570 --> 31:52.070]  Even though I invite him to come on the show.
[31:52.190 --> 31:56.130]  You even popped into their stream last week, and he was still like, dude, get out of here.
[31:56.310 --> 31:57.770]  Like, I don't wanna be on your show.
[31:57.870 --> 31:58.570]  He cramped up my style.
[31:58.750 --> 31:58.770]  Yeah.
[31:59.270 --> 32:01.110]  Which I hurt my feelings a little bit, but what are you gonna do?
[32:01.230 --> 32:02.050]  Yeah, you know.
[32:02.050 --> 32:04.210]  Well, maybe this will...
[32:04.210 --> 32:06.330]  I don't know, let him know that we're a friendly place.
[32:06.550 --> 32:09.630]  Yeah, it's like we're gamer... or we're Disney friendly here.
[32:10.490 --> 32:11.550]  All right, let's...
[32:11.550 --> 32:12.230]  Oh, okay.
[32:12.330 --> 32:14.190]  We got that.
[32:14.690 --> 32:15.550]  That card.
[32:16.310 --> 32:18.550]  Scan that QR code and get something.
[32:18.750 --> 32:19.210]  That's cool.
[32:22.370 --> 32:23.270]  We'll give that to you.
[32:24.070 --> 32:25.430]  Oh, shit.
[32:25.610 --> 32:26.550]  I'm gonna need some help.
[32:26.710 --> 32:26.850]  Okay.
[32:26.890 --> 32:27.750]  Here's that guy.
[32:28.990 --> 32:30.330]  Oh, was that...
[32:30.330 --> 32:30.810]  Was that the fox from...
[32:30.810 --> 32:32.090]  It says Card Fun.
[32:32.930 --> 32:35.070]  He looks like a professional fox.
[32:35.250 --> 32:36.870]  Is that the fox from...
[32:36.950 --> 32:37.890]  What was the...
[32:37.890 --> 32:38.870]  Zootopia, yeah.
[32:39.090 --> 32:39.490]  Zootopia.
[32:39.670 --> 32:41.150]  Okay, well, it seems to be a foil fox.
[32:41.270 --> 32:45.790]  This is what comes up when I try to go to the QR code.
[32:45.830 --> 32:47.070]  Controller not exist.
[32:47.390 --> 32:48.130]  Oh, well.
[32:49.330 --> 32:49.910]  We tried.
[32:50.290 --> 32:51.510]  Oh, here's a...
[32:51.510 --> 32:53.090]  I believe this is a...
[32:53.090 --> 32:53.810]  Some sort of a weird...
[32:54.890 --> 32:56.470]  A clear card...
[32:56.470 --> 32:56.930]  On either way.
[32:56.950 --> 32:59.390]  That is different on the front and the back.
[32:59.450 --> 33:00.150]  That's impressive.
[33:00.470 --> 33:01.170]  Here, maybe this.
[33:01.630 --> 33:02.030]  And...
[33:02.030 --> 33:03.250]  Yeah, here you go.
[33:03.290 --> 33:03.570]  Thank you.
[33:04.290 --> 33:05.390]  So, there's a...
[33:05.390 --> 33:06.710]  You can kind of see Bambi there.
[33:07.250 --> 33:08.490]  Ambi, I think you can read.
[33:08.710 --> 33:09.150]  And then...
[33:09.150 --> 33:09.470]  There's Bambi.
[33:09.790 --> 33:12.370]  Are they recutting Bambi not to kill her mom?
[33:12.910 --> 33:13.650]  Or his mom?
[33:13.970 --> 33:16.470]  Well, Bambi's not the one that kills...
[33:16.470 --> 33:22.390]  No, but I think I read a headline that said they were editing Bambi to make it less controversial for children.
[33:22.710 --> 33:23.270]  I can't imagine...
[33:23.270 --> 33:25.990]  Like, maybe not hearing the gunshot that takes...
[33:25.990 --> 33:27.010]  I think you should add to it.
[33:27.330 --> 33:28.650]  Is Bambi a boy or a girl?
[33:29.110 --> 33:34.160]  I don't know!
[33:34.160 --> 33:34.740]  You know what?
[33:35.000 --> 33:35.480]  You know what?
[33:35.900 --> 33:36.720]  It doesn't matter.
[33:37.100 --> 33:37.990]  Of course, but...
[33:38.520 --> 33:39.640]  Here's a scat cat.
[33:40.580 --> 33:41.880]  No, that's from Aristocats.
[33:42.060 --> 33:43.880]  I fucking love Aristocats.
[33:43.880 --> 33:47.050]  That is one of the first things I learned about you, is that you love Aristocats.
[33:48.220 --> 33:49.720]  I like Marie from Aristocats.
[33:50.280 --> 33:51.560]  Oh, here we have this guy.
[33:52.140 --> 33:54.300]  The Marshmallow Man from Big...
[33:54.300 --> 33:54.680]  Hero?
[33:55.060 --> 33:56.180]  Hero number nine.
[33:56.780 --> 33:57.520]  I never saw that.
[33:57.660 --> 33:57.940]  Six.
[33:58.360 --> 33:58.920]  Oh, you guys haven't seen it?
[33:58.940 --> 33:59.980]  This is why we look at y'all.
[34:00.500 --> 34:01.760]  Oh, I got an advanced copy.
[34:01.760 --> 34:02.340]  You should see it.
[34:02.400 --> 34:03.280]  Big Hero number nine is way better.
[34:03.420 --> 34:03.940]  Here you go.
[34:04.780 --> 34:06.400]  Oh, we have Buzz Lightyear.
[34:06.480 --> 34:07.040]  I know that one.
[34:07.160 --> 34:08.020]  That's another card fun.
[34:08.140 --> 34:08.860]  It is card fun.
[34:09.560 --> 34:10.460]  Sort of lenticular.
[34:10.680 --> 34:12.120]  Or not lenticular, but...
[34:12.120 --> 34:12.420]  Foil.
[34:12.720 --> 34:14.300]  We got two more of these puppies jumping up.
[34:16.100 --> 34:17.200]  How's everybody in the chat doing?
[34:17.940 --> 34:18.860]  Bambi be boy.
[34:19.240 --> 34:20.040]  Bambi be girl.
[34:21.420 --> 34:21.740]  Well...
[34:21.740 --> 34:22.900]  He's the prince of the forest.
[34:23.300 --> 34:25.200]  Bambi got antlers later, so he's a boy.
[34:25.200 --> 34:26.680]  Yeah, I remember Bambi being a boy.
[34:26.900 --> 34:27.160]  Yeah.
[34:27.240 --> 34:27.800]  When I was a kid.
[34:27.860 --> 34:28.660]  But they may have changed that.
[34:28.700 --> 34:29.020]  I don't know.
[34:29.020 --> 34:30.140]  Do you notice our new sign?
[34:31.520 --> 34:32.420]  Are you talking to me or the audience?
[34:32.500 --> 34:32.960]  The audience.
[34:33.160 --> 34:33.500]  Oh, yeah.
[34:33.540 --> 34:34.680]  We got the Duval Street sign.
[34:34.820 --> 34:36.100]  All the way from Key...
[34:36.100 --> 34:37.020]  All the way from a...
[34:38.560 --> 34:39.960]  Key Lime Pie store in Key West.
[34:39.960 --> 34:43.080]  You climbed up to the top of the, like, stoplight.
[34:43.380 --> 34:44.680]  And you unscrewed it.
[34:44.760 --> 34:46.280]  And you said, I want this for the break show.
[34:46.520 --> 34:47.300]  This is mine.
[34:47.520 --> 34:47.720]  Yeah.
[34:48.980 --> 34:49.820]  Then we got Woody.
[34:50.160 --> 34:50.600]  Card fun.
[34:50.860 --> 34:51.700]  There's another...
[34:51.700 --> 34:54.440]  I was gonna say it's a foil, but they all seem to be, so...
[34:54.440 --> 34:56.360]  If you like Woody, how about a twofer?
[34:56.460 --> 34:56.840]  There's Woody.
[34:56.840 --> 34:59.680]  You probably don't remember that Woody's a prolific guitar player, but he is.
[34:59.860 --> 35:00.060]  Yeah.
[35:01.940 --> 35:03.240]  Here's Captain Incredible.
[35:03.660 --> 35:04.660]  Mr. Incredible Dad.
[35:04.780 --> 35:05.340]  Incredible Dad.
[35:05.900 --> 35:06.220]  Card fun.
[35:06.720 --> 35:07.140]  Card fun.
[35:07.400 --> 35:08.080]  Yeah, there you go.
[35:08.560 --> 35:09.240]  And then...
[35:09.240 --> 35:10.440]  Oh, that guy.
[35:10.800 --> 35:11.260]  Peter Pan.
[35:11.520 --> 35:12.000]  Yeah, that's his name.
[35:14.960 --> 35:15.760]  Peter Pan.
[35:15.940 --> 35:16.180]  Yes.
[35:16.900 --> 35:17.500]  Peter Pan.
[35:18.660 --> 35:23.120]  I always wanted one of the dogs in Peter Pan and name it Nana.
[35:23.340 --> 35:24.440]  Because she had her little hat.
[35:24.620 --> 35:25.700]  And she was just so sweet.
[35:25.700 --> 35:26.260]  Yeah.
[35:26.300 --> 35:27.480]  That's just one of those little things.
[35:28.640 --> 35:31.080]  Did you watch the live action Peter Pan a lot when you were little?
[35:31.260 --> 35:32.300]  The one with the...
[35:32.300 --> 35:33.380]  It was a woman who played her.
[35:33.660 --> 35:34.360]  No, no, no.
[35:34.380 --> 35:35.380]  The one before that.
[35:35.420 --> 35:36.760]  Oh, with like a...
[35:36.760 --> 35:37.460]  What was her name?
[35:38.080 --> 35:38.800]  Julie Andrews?
[35:39.080 --> 35:40.700]  No, it wasn't Julie Andrews, but...
[35:41.340 --> 35:44.200]  I mean, she had short blonde hair like Julie Andrews, but...
[35:44.200 --> 35:45.240]  I'm pretty sure it was Julie Andrews.
[35:46.520 --> 35:47.020]  Chip and...
[35:47.020 --> 35:47.560]  Chip or Dale.
[35:48.760 --> 35:49.960]  That movie was good.
[35:50.040 --> 35:50.540]  That remake.
[35:50.820 --> 35:51.540]  Are you gonna sleeve these?
[35:52.220 --> 35:53.240]  Do you want these sleeved?
[35:53.240 --> 35:54.220]  I want them all sleeved.
[35:54.280 --> 35:55.300]  Okay, okay, okay.
[35:56.720 --> 35:57.720]  Hop to it.
[35:57.880 --> 35:59.380]  Hey, here's...
[36:00.740 --> 36:01.180]  Merida?
[36:01.420 --> 36:01.880]  Is that her name?
[36:02.380 --> 36:02.760]  Yes.
[36:03.260 --> 36:05.280]  My kid liked that movie when she was a little girl.
[36:05.580 --> 36:05.680]  Brave?
[36:05.960 --> 36:06.540]  Brave, yeah.
[36:08.780 --> 36:12.200]  Oh, here's that guy from that movie.
[36:12.700 --> 36:14.140]  Is that the one from Incredibles?
[36:14.540 --> 36:16.060]  Where he's like, where's my suit?
[36:16.480 --> 36:16.660]  No?
[36:18.120 --> 36:19.100]  That's the guy from Soul.
[36:19.340 --> 36:20.660]  Oh, I didn't see that one.
[36:21.620 --> 36:22.500]  And then...
[36:22.500 --> 36:23.740]  Here we go, another one.
[36:23.740 --> 36:26.920]  That's the Day of the Dead one.
[36:27.300 --> 36:28.300]  God, we're old.
[36:29.620 --> 36:31.120]  God, I feel like my mom.
[36:31.900 --> 36:35.060]  I haven't watched a lot of cartoons in the last 20 years.
[36:35.100 --> 36:35.740]  What is this one?
[36:36.340 --> 36:36.600]  Coco.
[36:37.260 --> 36:44.880]  I had heard rumors that they were gonna reskin the Haunted Mansion to be Coco, but that obviously never happened.
[36:45.500 --> 36:47.260]  I don't know, I haven't been there to confirm it, have I?
[36:47.420 --> 36:50.900]  They probably, Jack probably got real upset about that.
[36:51.120 --> 36:52.320]  I don't know where this came from.
[36:52.320 --> 36:54.720]  2022 Diamond Kings, six cards a side.
[36:54.900 --> 36:56.260]  That came from...
[36:57.220 --> 36:59.380]  Oh, okay, it's like a free-throwing pack.
[36:59.520 --> 37:00.680]  Okay, we'll see what we get here.
[37:02.440 --> 37:03.320]  Eddie Stanky.
[37:05.300 --> 37:05.740]  Stanky?
[37:05.880 --> 37:07.740]  We'll just leave that for many obvious reasons.
[37:08.720 --> 37:10.300]  Eddie Murray, classic player.
[37:10.340 --> 37:14.620]  Would you say this name is a body part for the stanky leg?
[37:15.660 --> 37:16.160]  Stanky leg?
[37:16.180 --> 37:16.880]  Name is a dance.
[37:18.120 --> 37:19.780]  Jake McCarthy, bass rookie.
[37:20.400 --> 37:21.260]  That's cool.
[37:21.260 --> 37:23.740]  Gallery of Stars, Nolan Arenado.
[37:24.120 --> 37:25.500]  That's cute, we'll save that.
[37:26.360 --> 37:28.660]  Artist proof for Tyler Gilbert rookie.
[37:28.800 --> 37:29.620]  That's cool.
[37:30.060 --> 37:31.960]  And then, oh, a relic.
[37:32.260 --> 37:36.020]  We have a Alex, or AJ Alexi...
[37:36.880 --> 37:37.540]  Jersey Warner.
[37:39.200 --> 37:40.200]  This is...
[37:40.200 --> 37:44.860]  The enclosed player-worn used material is guaranteed.
[37:44.960 --> 37:46.220]  So that's player-worn, that's cool.
[37:46.420 --> 37:48.080]  Doesn't mean it's game-worn, but it is player-worn.
[37:48.080 --> 37:51.260]  I suspect what that means is they put them in a room and they've got like,
[37:51.400 --> 37:54.820]  we need to sign this piece of paper a thousand times with the stickers they throw on cards.
[37:54.980 --> 37:57.360]  And they go, can you put these nine jerseys on for one second each?
[37:57.420 --> 37:58.020]  And he goes, okay, sure.
[37:58.360 --> 38:00.380]  Oh, so it just says player-worn instead of game-worn.
[38:00.380 --> 38:01.840]  And then he's like, technically I wore it.
[38:02.240 --> 38:03.520]  So a few stickers, please.
[38:03.800 --> 38:06.500]  Wow. So, what is Diamond Kings? I haven't...
[38:06.500 --> 38:09.420]  It's just a version of Panini baseball cards.
[38:09.480 --> 38:10.200]  They're unlicensed.
[38:10.680 --> 38:12.260]  But it's cool you get a relic in it.
[38:12.400 --> 38:13.140]  Yeah, yeah.
[38:13.460 --> 38:16.080]  Oh, but it's unlicensed, so it doesn't show...
[38:16.080 --> 38:18.260]  It doesn't show what team he's on. It's airbrushed off, yeah.
[38:18.380 --> 38:19.260]  On any... Oh!
[38:19.420 --> 38:20.500]  Yeah, none of Panini's...
[38:20.500 --> 38:22.480]  That's why I don't buy Panini baseball products very often.
[38:22.840 --> 38:23.220]  But now...
[38:23.940 --> 38:24.300]  Hard...
[38:24.720 --> 38:27.400]  But now, who owns all of it now?
[38:28.820 --> 38:32.080]  Well, Panini still owns Panini, but they've lost...
[38:32.080 --> 38:33.660]  They didn't have the rights to baseball anyway.
[38:34.500 --> 38:35.400]  Fanatics has it all now.
[38:35.460 --> 38:35.820]  Fanatics.
[38:35.840 --> 38:38.540]  Fanatics bought Topps, and now they own pretty much all of it.
[38:38.580 --> 38:41.100]  But they're not gonna change the name of Topps?
[38:41.140 --> 38:41.560]  Who knows?
[38:42.440 --> 38:43.400]  Beavis and Butthead.
[38:43.480 --> 38:44.900]  We'll open one of these packs of Beavis and Butthead.
[38:44.900 --> 38:45.520]  Nice.
[38:47.040 --> 38:50.400]  I gotta get a good, uh...
[38:50.400 --> 38:51.020]  What's this say?
[38:51.060 --> 38:51.860]  Don't be sticky.
[38:54.100 --> 38:55.360]  I paid money for these.
[38:56.560 --> 38:58.140]  Mistress Cora Anthrax.
[38:58.220 --> 38:59.340]  This is the old Beavis and Butthead.
[38:59.500 --> 39:00.340]  I'm pretty...
[39:00.340 --> 39:04.440]  Which was my childhood, but I'm really well-versed on new Beavis and Butthead, so I don't remember all the old stuff.
[39:04.540 --> 39:04.780]  Right.
[39:05.740 --> 39:06.100]  Mastermony.
[39:06.120 --> 39:07.000]  Dude, that's us.
[39:07.600 --> 39:08.600]  Oh, who should sleep in that?
[39:08.600 --> 39:09.260]  That's us when we get married.
[39:09.420 --> 39:10.540]  So this is our wedding portrait.
[39:12.080 --> 39:13.500]  Here's me in school.
[39:14.040 --> 39:14.680]  Incognito.
[39:14.980 --> 39:15.700]  Oh my gosh.
[39:16.480 --> 39:17.560]  Here we have...
[39:18.340 --> 39:18.860]  No laughing.
[39:19.300 --> 39:19.920]  Part two.
[39:20.160 --> 39:21.080]  It's like scared straight.
[39:24.540 --> 39:25.820]  Prehistoric times.
[39:26.000 --> 39:26.520]  B.C.
[39:29.740 --> 39:30.980]  Oh shit, dude.
[39:31.300 --> 39:32.420]  Here's a, uh...
[39:32.420 --> 39:38.500]  At the turbo mall, we hocked up those loogies like sticky green lightning.
[39:38.880 --> 39:39.880]  It's just a mall picture.
[39:40.480 --> 39:41.460]  That's where they...
[39:41.460 --> 39:42.780]  Do you see any sticky green lightning?
[39:43.220 --> 39:44.140]  Magazines and books.
[39:44.660 --> 39:45.020]  Cool.
[39:45.120 --> 39:47.020]  Dude, that's a mall card.
[39:47.240 --> 39:47.840]  Mall draft.
[39:50.280 --> 39:51.000]  And then...
[39:51.000 --> 39:52.360]  What are you...
[39:52.360 --> 39:52.920]  Oh, here we go.
[39:53.100 --> 39:53.800]  The crush.
[39:54.180 --> 39:55.440]  That's when they're in the back of a car.
[39:56.180 --> 39:56.680]  In the trunk.
[39:56.940 --> 39:57.800]  You ever been in the trunk of a car?
[39:59.140 --> 39:59.500]  Uh...
[39:59.500 --> 40:00.440]  Not voluntarily.
[40:01.120 --> 40:01.520]  I'm just kidding.
[40:01.680 --> 40:02.440]  No, I'm just kidding.
[40:02.600 --> 40:02.900]  I'm fine.
[40:03.560 --> 40:04.280]  No laughing.
[40:05.820 --> 40:06.720]  What about you?
[40:07.480 --> 40:08.240]  Yeah, for sure.
[40:09.400 --> 40:09.740]  For...
[40:09.740 --> 40:11.000]  Like, how many times?
[40:11.340 --> 40:12.240]  Both voluntarily and involuntarily, probably.
[40:12.480 --> 40:12.900]  I don't know.
[40:12.980 --> 40:13.900]  I'm a dude.
[40:14.040 --> 40:15.120]  I was in Alabama growing up.
[40:15.620 --> 40:16.300]  Probably lots.
[40:16.480 --> 40:17.100]  I don't know.
[40:17.200 --> 40:18.060]  Just to, like, get somewhere?
[40:18.100 --> 40:19.380]  Just fucking around, or...
[40:19.380 --> 40:20.080]  Just wanna see what it was like.
[40:20.100 --> 40:20.640]  See what it's like.
[40:20.760 --> 40:23.560]  What else are you gonna do on a Tuesday night in Alabama when you're 17?
[40:24.720 --> 40:25.060]  Uh...
[40:25.060 --> 40:26.040]  Oh, Principal MacGyver.
[40:26.680 --> 40:27.480]  Er, MacVicar, sorry.
[40:27.740 --> 40:28.160]  He's funny.
[40:28.240 --> 40:28.980]  And then...
[40:28.980 --> 40:29.760]  Washington Dog.
[40:30.420 --> 40:31.060]  Those are cute.
[40:31.680 --> 40:33.320]  Maybe they'll make new ones for the new seasons.
[40:33.660 --> 40:34.160]  That'd be awesome.
[40:34.560 --> 40:34.900]  Yeah.
[40:35.500 --> 40:36.840]  I'll put these over here.
[40:37.420 --> 40:38.060]  What now?
[40:38.480 --> 40:39.340]  Let's open up.
[40:39.420 --> 40:40.460]  I'm very excited about this.
[40:40.540 --> 40:41.920]  This just came out.
[40:42.580 --> 40:49.980]  It's a Prism Hobby Box of WNBA 2023 WNBA Prism Trading Cards.
[40:50.220 --> 40:52.240]  I've been a fan of WNBA for a little while.
[40:52.380 --> 40:52.880]  I've been getting...
[40:52.880 --> 40:55.160]  I tried to collect cards a couple years ago, but it's hard.
[40:55.240 --> 40:56.460]  They don't release every year.
[40:56.940 --> 40:58.080]  But they are...
[40:58.080 --> 41:00.580]  So when I saw they were making Prism for this year, I jumped on it.
[41:00.780 --> 41:01.140]  Who...
[41:01.140 --> 41:02.480]  We watched a game last...
[41:02.480 --> 41:02.900]  The other night.
[41:02.980 --> 41:03.640]  Gracie jumped on it.
[41:03.680 --> 41:04.180]  Gracie bought it.
[41:04.220 --> 41:06.000]  Which was...
[41:06.420 --> 41:07.620]  Last night we watched...
[41:07.620 --> 41:08.120]  Aces and...
[41:08.120 --> 41:09.180]  Aces and Liberty.
[41:09.240 --> 41:09.440]  Liberty.
[41:09.780 --> 41:12.000]  And who was the one that...
[41:12.600 --> 41:12.940]  Shoot.
[41:13.020 --> 41:13.920]  She got fouled that time.
[41:14.260 --> 41:14.720]  She got...
[41:14.720 --> 41:16.620]  Or she fell down and she's like, that wasn't a foul.
[41:16.720 --> 41:17.260]  And then she got it.
[41:17.800 --> 41:19.020]  Oh, it was Aja Wilson, I think.
[41:21.000 --> 41:21.400]  Yeah.
[41:21.660 --> 41:26.640]  It's the Liberty and the Aces are the number one and the number two teams in WNBA.
[41:26.740 --> 41:28.080]  They're both kind of like super teams.
[41:28.340 --> 41:28.680]  Ah.
[41:29.400 --> 41:32.960]  And it's basically Aja Wilson on the...
[41:32.960 --> 41:39.080]  It was the tightest or most closely contested MVP race in WNBA history.
[41:39.820 --> 41:41.400]  And it was...
[41:42.640 --> 41:44.760]  Brianna Stewart, who plays for New York.
[41:44.860 --> 41:45.140]  Uh-huh.
[41:45.580 --> 41:49.240]  And then Aja Wilson, who plays for the Las Vegas Aces.
[41:49.480 --> 41:49.680]  Okay.
[41:49.720 --> 41:53.180]  And I think Brianna Stewart got it, but last night Aja Wilson got it.
[41:53.280 --> 41:55.440]  It was a close game until about midway through the third quarter.
[41:55.600 --> 41:57.360]  And then the Aces just blew it open.
[41:57.520 --> 41:57.720]  Yeah.
[41:57.800 --> 42:00.840]  So we'll put one pack in the pack sack.
[42:00.840 --> 42:02.260]  So their next game is...
[42:02.260 --> 42:02.680]  It's the finals, right?
[42:02.740 --> 42:03.660]  Wednesday night, I believe.
[42:03.680 --> 42:03.840]  Okay.
[42:04.040 --> 42:04.460]  It's game two.
[42:04.960 --> 42:06.180]  I will definitely be watching it.
[42:06.540 --> 42:11.280]  And then tonight is the first game that you'll pay attention to.
[42:11.460 --> 42:14.140]  Yeah, I couldn't really watch the first Celtics preseason game.
[42:14.160 --> 42:16.900]  But I will watch Celtics next tonight in just a few hours.
[42:17.120 --> 42:20.060]  So here what we're looking for, any stars, any parallels.
[42:20.600 --> 42:22.180]  I'm still learning the WNBA.
[42:22.260 --> 42:23.720]  I don't know it quite like I know the NBA.
[42:25.240 --> 42:27.200]  I really like Brianna Stewart.
[42:27.400 --> 42:27.580]  Yeah.
[42:28.680 --> 42:30.120]  I like Sabrina Ionescu.
[42:30.120 --> 42:32.140]  So those cards would be cool.
[42:32.200 --> 42:33.740]  Cheryl Swoopes, awesome.
[42:33.800 --> 42:36.320]  That's the only, I was just about to say that was the only WNBA player...
[42:36.760 --> 42:37.960]  First superstar of the league.
[42:37.980 --> 42:38.240]  I like knew.
[42:38.360 --> 42:39.220]  I was living in Houston.
[42:39.400 --> 42:39.960]  She was like everything.
[42:39.960 --> 42:40.320]  Absolutely.
[42:40.840 --> 42:41.380]  I'm gonna say that.
[42:41.740 --> 42:43.020]  Yeah, go for it.
[42:45.260 --> 42:46.220]  Maya Caldwell.
[42:47.120 --> 42:48.080]  Nylissa Smith.
[42:50.000 --> 42:50.960]  Christy Wallace.
[42:52.300 --> 42:53.260]  Stephanie Dolson.
[42:54.800 --> 42:55.760]  Azura Stevens.
[42:57.740 --> 42:58.700]  Maddie Segrist.
[42:58.840 --> 42:59.440]  That's her rookie.
[42:59.440 --> 43:00.660]  Just leave that.
[43:01.720 --> 43:02.680]  Shay Petty.
[43:03.100 --> 43:03.640]  Oh, shit.
[43:03.920 --> 43:04.640]  Oh, shit.
[43:04.980 --> 43:05.700]  Oh, shit.
[43:05.780 --> 43:06.260]  Oh, shit.
[43:06.360 --> 43:06.580]  Oh, shit.
[43:09.420 --> 43:11.200]  What a fucking day this is.
[43:12.800 --> 43:13.760]  I'm sorry.
[43:14.160 --> 43:15.260]  I'm not going to show it yet.
[43:15.380 --> 43:15.440]  What?
[43:15.840 --> 43:16.040]  What?
[43:16.500 --> 43:17.080]  I need to see.
[43:17.240 --> 43:19.820]  Here's a red wave Lindsay Allen.
[43:20.140 --> 43:20.760]  That's cool.
[43:21.140 --> 43:21.560]  Parallel.
[43:21.640 --> 43:23.480]  Also, this is a really cool shot.
[43:23.860 --> 43:26.660]  It's just like behind the back, she's like whatever.
[43:26.660 --> 43:34.500]  Here's a silver prism Jordan Canada will sleeve that and then here is we were looking for a Brianna Stewart
[43:34.500 --> 43:37.320]  Okay, it's not a brown. So let's get a Brianna Stewart fucking
[43:40.240 --> 43:41.120]  Prism holy
[43:44.160 --> 43:48.820]  Number on it to Brianna Stewart number 30. That's about as big as of a hit as you can hope to get
[43:49.860 --> 43:51.460]  Don't forget it number 30
[43:52.840 --> 43:54.180]  Awesome you have a little hard
[43:56.660 --> 44:01.040]  Fucked up by not flying when we did cuz he's missing all this curse, right?
[44:01.320 --> 44:05.640]  Oh, that was the curse. We'll top load some of these and let me find some top letters for you
[44:07.020 --> 44:12.120]  Dude, she looks so cool. She's like the girl cards like WNBA cards are
[44:14.420 --> 44:19.980]  Yeah, all the other guys are like like what I'm my ball but these girls like passing it dude
[44:20.580 --> 44:22.360]  That is so fucking cool
[44:22.840 --> 44:26.380]  What a fucking I don't know that I mean it could be numbered and that would be bigger
[44:27.240 --> 44:33.600]  Asia Wilson would be arguably as big but that's like the equivalent of getting a LeBron auto Wow NBA
[44:33.600 --> 44:35.980]  so you're saying that like
[44:36.520 --> 44:39.500]  On-card is obviously on the card, but then they usually
[44:42.280 --> 44:44.260]  They'll be like be like a you know
[44:44.260 --> 44:47.880]  Just like a sheet of transfer paper almost and they'll just be like 30 stickers on it
[44:47.880 --> 44:51.240]  They just go and then they never see then the stickers get peeled off carefully and put on cards
[44:51.240 --> 44:52.960]  So then most of them they never see
[44:53.420 --> 44:58.180]  Unless it's an on-card and they actually the cool thing about on-card autos is, you know, they held it in their hand and signed it
[44:58.180 --> 45:03.840]  Yeah, that's cool. We'll sleep this guy right here. It's fucking awesome, dude
[45:03.840 --> 45:04.540]  Oh
[45:06.580 --> 45:08.860]  That what a great I
[45:08.860 --> 45:15.200]  Agree, don't dove night Dover night. What a fucking that was I feel like these packs are gonna be a letdown now after that
[45:15.200 --> 45:17.360]  But what do we get in here we get?
[45:20.480 --> 45:23.060]  Two autographs, so they'll be another one. Hey, awesome

[46:54.700 --> 46:58.640]  Like other than like this sideshow Bob hair, but no one has really long hair
[46:58.640 --> 47:02.880]  I think a crowder does and it has like big dreadlocks to go down
[47:06.100 --> 47:09.300]  Derek Rose did for a while. He got rid of it. I think
[47:10.260 --> 47:12.580]  But yeah, you're right there. I mean, it's probably I
[47:13.700 --> 47:17.500]  Just know that with that isn't it with NFL that if they if their hair is long
[47:17.500 --> 47:19.920]  It's like it's it's okay to pull it. Yeah

[48:16.060 --> 48:23.100]  Let's do 2019. Yeah, I'll let me get her so we'll see the box topper from four years ago and then if it's a rip card
[48:23.840 --> 48:26.500]  we still have to wait to open it, right like
[48:28.800 --> 48:30.720]  We'll let the audience decide yeah
[48:33.780 --> 48:37.700]  Your let's play came out this week that's super exciting. Oh, yes
[48:38.820 --> 48:41.100]  Yeah, that's cool. And then today you're
[48:41.880 --> 48:42.320]  the
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.440]  Hearing you record this the fuck face off
[48:45.440 --> 48:51.620]  This was when I really was the most concerned about our neighbors hearing you scream. I'd be the loudest
[48:51.620 --> 48:53.500]  I've ever yelled in my life. It was
[48:54.140 --> 49:01.300]  Like I need to get the sound for that room if you're an RT first member you can watch it right first episode right now
[49:01.300 --> 49:02.640]  It's a six episode season
[49:03.320 --> 49:08.320]  The premise is we all got together in this game called super mega baseball
[49:08.320 --> 49:13.740]  I believe and we all created our own teams created our own characters teams logos names
[49:14.240 --> 49:14.720]  everything
[49:15.580 --> 49:19.780]  Mine mine was the best thing was the most consistently themed out of all of them all brag
[49:19.780 --> 49:25.080]  But everybody had awesome teams and then we set the computer up to play each other and then we commentate
[49:25.080 --> 49:27.440]  Much like we're managers on a sports team, right?
[49:27.500 --> 49:30.920]  And then the winner of the whole season the whole league
[49:30.920 --> 49:36.900]  We have announced gets a billboard in of in their honor in the center of the face universe
[49:36.900 --> 49:41.800]  Which is deputy, Indiana of all places and then the loser the way we do it
[49:42.460 --> 49:48.100]  Face is that the loser isn't the team that does the worst like in the NFL or the NBA, right?
[49:48.140 --> 49:52.440]  The losers the team that loses the finals because that's the real loss, right?
[49:52.540 --> 49:53.760]  You're like at the top of the mountain
[49:53.760 --> 49:54.000]  Yeah
[49:54.000 --> 49:59.400]  Didn't quite get there and so that the person who loses has to wear the big red boots that I got
[49:59.400 --> 50:05.340]  Around the mall for one hour. They need to bandage up their shins before they put the boots on. Hey, babe
[50:06.900 --> 50:08.700]  Oh, is it really? Is it a rip card?
[50:09.140 --> 50:10.780]  Alright, calm down. Oh my god. Yeah
[50:10.780 --> 50:12.340]  Oh, I finally got one!
[50:12.860 --> 50:14.660]  Number 5 of 65
[50:15.300 --> 50:20.600]  We have here a Carlos Correa Houston Astros 2019 rip card. This is the best day ever.
[50:21.320 --> 50:27.400]  Everything's a hit today. Everything's a hit today. Do we open it? Do we buy a lotto ticket on the way home?
[50:27.760 --> 50:33.040]  This is a good day. I kind of feel like our luck has been so good today already
[50:33.660 --> 50:34.660]  Do you want to do it today?
[50:34.860 --> 50:35.880]  Fuck it, why not, right?
[50:35.880 --> 50:37.580]  What? Oh my god.
[50:37.640 --> 50:37.980]  Why not?
[50:38.040 --> 50:39.320]  I love breaking the rules. Yay!
[50:40.260 --> 50:41.600]  For real? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[50:41.600 --> 50:43.160]  We got so many good cards. Why not?
[50:43.160 --> 50:44.840]  Wait, okay, so what's the deal with Carlos Correa?
[50:45.760 --> 50:49.420]  Carlos Correa, he's a very good baseball player who I don't think plays for Houston anymore.
[50:50.400 --> 50:54.280]  I think he got traded or left, but he's a really good player. It's a good card.
[50:54.500 --> 50:55.300]  You're gonna open it today?
[50:55.320 --> 50:56.260]  This is probably worth a couple hundred bucks.
[50:56.320 --> 50:57.720]  Oh my god.
[50:58.100 --> 50:58.640]  But why not?
[50:59.400 --> 51:04.160]  So here's what we can get. Inside this card will be an exclusive mini stained glass parallel and two of the following.
[51:04.160 --> 51:11.100]  An exclusive mini parallel, an exclusive mini wood parallel, an exclusive mini metal parallel, a red mini autograph card or one-of-a-kind sketch card.
[51:11.200 --> 51:15.380]  Any of those other than the base parallels is what we want.
[51:15.600 --> 51:18.660]  Okay, so is the chat for the live stuff?
[51:18.980 --> 51:20.780]  Do not rip it. Okay, got it, we will.
[51:20.840 --> 51:24.560]  But then everyone says rip. Oh my god, you're ripping it! Oh my god.
[51:26.520 --> 51:28.400]  Wait, how many are in there? I wasn't listening all the way.
[51:28.740 --> 51:29.860]  It's three cards. It's a double rip card.
[51:29.860 --> 51:31.060]  I can't believe we're doing this right now.
[51:31.180 --> 51:31.940]  So it's three cards.
[51:34.340 --> 51:37.100]  Gosh, I don't even know like what sounds to do.
[51:39.140 --> 51:40.280]  Oh, that's a good one.
[51:52.090 --> 51:53.270]  I can't believe you.
[51:53.470 --> 51:55.970]  Ken Griffey Jr. parallel.
[51:56.290 --> 51:56.690]  Is that good?
[51:56.730 --> 52:01.430]  That's about as good as you're going to get on one of these base parallels, Griffey Jr.
[52:02.090 --> 52:04.110]  Unless you got like a hot rookie.
[52:04.330 --> 52:09.370]  And then our other card is, who is that? That's Chris Bryant.
[52:09.710 --> 52:12.030]  So these are not worth it yet.
[52:12.170 --> 52:12.530]  Okay.
[52:13.030 --> 52:15.690]  Although the Griffey is a nice card and I'm not mad about the Griffey.
[52:18.170 --> 52:25.210]  The final card, this will be, this will be our stained glass or a rarer card.
[52:26.470 --> 52:28.330]  Is it wood?
[52:28.770 --> 52:29.070]  No.
[52:29.310 --> 52:30.110]  Okay, it's stained glass?
[52:30.210 --> 52:30.330]  Yeah.
[52:30.530 --> 52:30.710]  Okay.
[52:36.260 --> 52:37.900]  Al Kaline, Hall of Famer.
[52:38.120 --> 52:40.080]  I don't even know what that means. I just want to stop it on that.
[52:40.900 --> 52:44.380]  It's an Al, it's a Hall of Famer stained glass. It's a nice card.
[52:45.040 --> 52:48.960]  It's probably not worth what we got, what we could have got for the box.
[52:49.000 --> 52:53.440]  But that's okay because we had a lot of fun and we got that Griffey Jr., which is nice.
[52:53.520 --> 52:56.360]  So let's sleeve these and sleeve this, please.
[52:57.140 --> 52:57.960]  Well, god dang.
[52:58.320 --> 53:02.540]  And then if you'll top load those, or at least top load the Al Kaline.
[53:03.780 --> 53:06.500]  I'll put them all into something. I'll top load that one.
[53:06.620 --> 53:07.840]  Okay, well, how do you feel?
[53:08.060 --> 53:11.400]  I feel good. I feel good. Yeah, it was fun. I'm happy I did it.
[53:11.720 --> 53:14.300]  And on a day like we're having, you got to keep rolling with it.
[53:14.300 --> 53:15.980]  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[53:16.700 --> 53:20.000]  And we still have the front of this card. Still looks nice.
[53:20.220 --> 53:20.460]  Yeah.
[53:21.340 --> 53:22.420]  Not mad at it?
[53:22.700 --> 53:23.680]  You're not mad at it?
[53:24.740 --> 53:25.100]  Whew.
[53:25.840 --> 53:26.560]  That was a lot.
[53:27.520 --> 53:28.220]  Can we do the Presidents?
[53:28.700 --> 53:29.020]  That was a lot.
[53:29.020 --> 53:31.900]  Or was that, like, did we use up our luck with the...
[53:31.900 --> 53:32.120]  No, let's do the Presidents now.
[53:32.120 --> 53:33.160]  I can't believe we got a RIP card.
[53:34.560 --> 53:35.700]  2019 RIP card, too.
[53:36.060 --> 53:36.180]  Dang.
[53:36.180 --> 53:37.220]  That could have been, like, an Otani RIP or something.
[53:37.220 --> 53:39.960]  So we could still have three more RIP cards.
[53:40.460 --> 53:40.780]  Yeah.
[53:41.120 --> 53:42.100]  One, two, three more.
[53:42.180 --> 53:43.880]  And I think there might be another box somewhere.
[53:44.680 --> 53:45.900]  Maybe we should just get more, too.
[53:46.260 --> 53:46.800]  Oh, you know what?
[53:46.900 --> 53:48.560]  Before we open that, I've been wanting to open this for a while.
[53:48.880 --> 53:52.740]  Let's open up this box of optic, hanger pack of optic.
[53:53.140 --> 54:00.600]  They say, as they say in the industry, in the collector's world, we say hangers are bangers.
[54:00.980 --> 54:01.800]  Hangers are bangers.
[54:01.920 --> 54:03.480]  That's what it's considered to be.
[54:03.700 --> 54:06.960]  And I see them so rarely these days that when I get a hanger...
[54:06.960 --> 54:11.040]  What's the difference when it's a squishy pack like this?
[54:11.320 --> 54:11.960]  Is this a hanger?
[54:15.060 --> 54:16.520]  No, this is just a fat pack.
[54:16.680 --> 54:17.360]  Fat pack.
[54:17.460 --> 54:17.720]  Yeah.
[54:18.520 --> 54:19.040]  Dang.
[54:19.180 --> 54:23.180]  Someone said we should have held on to that in case that guy wins the World Series.
[54:23.540 --> 54:23.660]  Eh.
[54:24.420 --> 54:26.140]  Probably should have, but we didn't.
[54:26.640 --> 54:28.200]  JJ Redick, Jalen Brown.
[54:28.440 --> 54:28.780]  Oh!
[54:29.460 --> 54:29.820]  Celtics.
[54:29.840 --> 54:30.140]  Celtics.
[54:30.640 --> 54:31.780]  Hey, Peyton Pritchard.
[54:31.780 --> 54:32.120]  Celtics.
[54:32.340 --> 54:33.380]  Base rookie.
[54:33.480 --> 54:33.900]  That's nice.
[54:34.020 --> 54:35.660]  Jalen Smith, silver rookie.
[54:35.660 --> 54:38.440]  Peyton Pritchard just got a four-year, $30 million extension.
[54:39.020 --> 54:43.120]  He is now the official backup point guard of the Boston Celtics, and he went fucking off last night.
[54:43.360 --> 54:43.700]  Good job.
[54:43.720 --> 54:44.960]  This Jalen Smith card is really pretty.
[54:45.060 --> 54:45.480]  That's silver.
[54:45.680 --> 54:46.520]  That's what you want.
[54:46.620 --> 54:48.640]  Jalen Smith has bounced around a little bit in the league.
[54:48.740 --> 54:50.920]  I'm not sure where he is right now, but he's not at the Suns.
[54:51.040 --> 54:51.880]  I know that.
[54:51.880 --> 54:54.500]  You don't see a lot of people wearing glasses like they used to.
[54:54.680 --> 54:55.140]  Yeah, you don't.
[54:57.420 --> 54:59.240]  Well, everybody gets Lasik now, right?
[54:59.400 --> 54:59.580]  Yeah.
[54:59.700 --> 55:00.700]  Julius Randall.
[55:01.360 --> 55:02.260]  Oh, speaking of...
[55:02.260 --> 55:02.640]  There you go.
[55:02.700 --> 55:04.180]  There's Derrick Rose with his long hair.
[55:04.240 --> 55:05.100]  Oh, yeah, he does.
[55:05.100 --> 55:05.980]  He's since shaved it.
[55:06.240 --> 55:07.180]  Oh, shit!
[55:07.360 --> 55:07.720]  Okay!
[55:09.080 --> 55:10.460]  Anthony Edwards baseball team.
[55:10.600 --> 55:11.840]  How did I actually have this shit?
[55:12.580 --> 55:16.080]  I mean, it's not like a ton of money or anything, but I like Anthony Edwards a lot.
[55:16.160 --> 55:17.560]  And I'm hoping he'll make his big leap this year.
[55:18.040 --> 55:18.880]  Oh, here we go.
[55:20.220 --> 55:21.760]  Purple, Draymond Green.
[55:22.920 --> 55:23.520]  That's nice.
[55:23.620 --> 55:24.780]  That's very pretty with the Lakers.
[55:25.120 --> 55:28.760]  You see right here, there's a giant print line running up his crotch.
[55:29.520 --> 55:31.600]  Kind of sucks, but...
[55:31.600 --> 55:32.080]  Still cool.
[55:32.800 --> 55:33.360]  And one more pack.
[55:33.640 --> 55:34.760]  Wow, that has already been worth it.
[55:36.100 --> 55:39.460]  For the Draymond or for the Anthony Edwards?
[55:39.460 --> 55:39.980]  For both of those.
[55:40.100 --> 55:41.700]  And then the silver Jalen Smith.
[55:41.940 --> 55:42.240]  Nice!
[55:42.420 --> 55:49.920]  Marvin Bagley Jr., Jarrett Culver, Cassius Stanley bass rookie, and a Kevin Durant winter stays insert.
[55:50.120 --> 55:50.600]  That's fine.
[55:51.500 --> 55:51.880]  Oh!
[55:51.980 --> 55:53.980]  I was going to open up these Allen & Gitter...
[55:53.980 --> 55:54.620]  Well, shit.
[55:54.740 --> 55:55.220]  We're running out of time.
[55:55.340 --> 55:58.500]  Let's open up one of these packs of 2019 Allen & Gitter just so we can see what they look like.
[55:58.620 --> 55:58.800]  Okay.
[56:01.420 --> 56:03.080]  I don't remember...
[56:03.080 --> 56:04.740]  It was before I was buying Allen & Gitter.
[56:04.740 --> 56:05.420]  Here we go.
[56:05.540 --> 56:13.620]  Alex Bregman, Jackie Robinson, Roger Maris, Tookie Toussaint rookie.
[56:14.300 --> 56:14.740]  Oh!
[56:15.060 --> 56:15.680]  You're going to love this.
[56:15.740 --> 56:16.480]  Collectible canines.
[56:16.560 --> 56:17.080]  It's a Weimaraner.
[56:18.260 --> 56:18.940]  That's a cutie.
[56:19.020 --> 56:19.660]  That's a cute.
[56:19.820 --> 56:25.580]  Sandy Koufax, Steve Carlton, and then Adrian Beltre.
[56:25.620 --> 56:27.440]  So a lot of Hall of Famers in there.
[56:27.580 --> 56:29.300]  They really are the best looking cards.
[56:30.300 --> 56:30.660]  They're so pretty.
[56:30.660 --> 56:31.440]  Yeah, they're pretty great.
[56:31.700 --> 56:32.380]  They're pretty great.
[56:32.880 --> 56:34.020]  Let me put these in here.
[56:34.440 --> 56:40.060]  This one, at the bottom of the dog one, it has like a little dog toy and a little dog bone.
[56:41.160 --> 56:42.800]  All right, should we get into this presidential stuff?
[56:42.920 --> 56:43.160]  Yes.
[56:43.920 --> 56:47.300]  Or, I shouldn't say presidential, but historical greats.
[56:47.320 --> 56:55.360]  So for the autograph or the relic or whatever it is, do you think that it will be a president or, like, or not a president?
[56:55.360 --> 56:57.740]  Like a political figure or athlete, I think.
[56:58.000 --> 56:58.300]  Okay.
[56:58.400 --> 56:59.440]  Is what our options are.
[56:59.440 --> 57:00.100]  Or a musician.
[57:00.820 --> 57:01.520]  Or an inventor.
[57:01.600 --> 57:01.780]  Oh, it could be a musician.
[57:01.780 --> 57:02.780]  I'm going to guess...
[57:08.180 --> 57:09.140]  I don't know.
[57:09.280 --> 57:09.760]  Do you have to feed?
[57:10.120 --> 57:10.320]  No.
[57:11.320 --> 57:12.140]  No, let's not feed.
[57:12.480 --> 57:12.660]  No.
[57:12.800 --> 57:13.720]  I want to see a monster.
[57:14.460 --> 57:16.320]  We're not going to get through them all, but we'll open what we can.
[57:16.440 --> 57:16.700]  Yes.
[57:17.320 --> 57:19.960]  Maybe we'll get a piece of Abraham Lincoln's beard or something.
[57:20.360 --> 57:20.720]  Whoa.
[57:22.120 --> 57:23.060]  What if we got...
[57:23.060 --> 57:24.480]  Let's see, who do we have on the box?
[57:24.560 --> 57:25.120]  Oh, shit.
[57:25.820 --> 57:26.580]  Is it something?
[57:27.560 --> 57:28.260]  What is it?
[57:28.820 --> 57:30.500]  Emily, this day gets better.
[57:30.500 --> 57:32.840]  This day just keeps getting better and better.
[57:33.920 --> 57:35.620]  Pierre Auguste Renoir.
[57:35.860 --> 57:36.600]  That's a Renoir card.
[57:36.720 --> 57:37.720]  Thomas Geofferson.
[57:38.480 --> 57:40.760]  Here we have a blue parallel for Louis Pasteur.
[57:41.440 --> 57:41.780]  Uh-huh.
[57:41.940 --> 57:45.540]  And then for our box relic, we have a Vincent van Gogh relic.
[57:45.900 --> 57:49.920]  What is it?
[57:50.960 --> 57:52.080]  It is...
[57:52.080 --> 57:52.440]  What?
[57:54.700 --> 57:57.680]  Congratulations, you've received an authentic relic from the past.
[57:57.680 --> 58:01.020]  The front of this card features the following types of authentic and original relics.
[58:01.320 --> 58:10.560]  Original newspapers, original handwritten letters, time period manuscripts, letters or documents, land grants, presidential documents, handwritten words, books, tickets, or other relics.
[58:10.780 --> 58:15.080]  So this is a piece of a letter that he wrote.
[58:15.080 --> 58:15.860]  Is that his handwriting?
[58:17.060 --> 58:19.160]  Yeah, we'll have to do some research, but that is...
[58:19.560 --> 58:26.240]  Whatever that piece of... that fragment of text is, it is personal to Vincent van Gogh.
[58:26.240 --> 58:28.160]  So we now have a Vincent... don't touch it.
[58:28.180 --> 58:28.780]  I touched it.
[58:28.980 --> 58:31.300]  Jesus Christ, it's like 200 years old.
[58:32.060 --> 58:33.680]  That's a Vincent van Gogh relic.
[58:34.740 --> 58:36.420]  Now, you know, I touched it.
[58:36.620 --> 58:37.760]  Do you think I have a curse now?
[58:38.840 --> 58:39.540]  My ears.
[58:40.680 --> 58:42.380]  I don't even know what to say about that.
[58:42.460 --> 58:43.360]  That's so crazy.
[58:43.980 --> 58:44.760]  Well, he's not a president.
[58:47.020 --> 58:47.380]  Wow.
[58:48.420 --> 58:52.680]  I mean, I'll have to do some reading up to see what it specifically is, but holy shit.
[58:52.700 --> 58:54.180]  We went to the van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.
[58:54.180 --> 58:56.480]  We did, and now we own a piece of van Gogh.
[58:56.560 --> 58:58.100]  I wonder what this goes for.
[58:58.760 --> 58:59.800]  Game used van Gogh.
[59:01.160 --> 59:02.280]  Would you sleeve these, please?
[59:02.560 --> 59:02.820]  Yes.
[59:03.160 --> 59:03.720]  Oh my God.
[59:03.720 --> 59:06.240]  Be very, very careful with Vincent van Gogh.
[59:06.340 --> 59:07.180]  I gotta feel like...
[59:08.100 --> 59:12.480]  I wanna know what he's... it obviously must be written in Dutch, right?
[59:12.560 --> 59:12.960]  Was he Dutch?
[59:13.600 --> 59:14.000]  Yeah.
[59:14.140 --> 59:14.820]  God, I'm an idiot.
[59:15.000 --> 59:15.640]  I don't know anything.
[59:17.540 --> 59:18.740]  Yeah, I'll look it up.
[59:18.820 --> 59:20.360]  It'll tell what it is.
[59:20.560 --> 59:22.440]  I can find out what it is specifically online.
[59:22.580 --> 59:23.540]  Pieces of the past.
[59:23.540 --> 59:24.420]  I'll report back to you guys.
[59:24.500 --> 59:26.080]  I'm gonna be busy pricing out these cards.
[59:26.200 --> 59:27.100]  I know, you have a big stack.
[59:27.200 --> 59:27.600]  Good Lord.
[59:28.020 --> 59:29.720]  All right, we're down to the last pack.
[59:30.060 --> 59:31.300]  Then we're gonna go...
[59:31.300 --> 59:32.720]  We got Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
[59:33.120 --> 59:34.460]  We have Mark Twain.
[59:34.600 --> 59:38.340]  We have a gold Isaac Newton parallel.
[59:38.840 --> 59:39.460]  Look at that.
[59:39.940 --> 59:43.080]  And then, pieces of the past, Sitting Bull.
[59:43.560 --> 59:44.200]  Oh, cool.
[59:44.960 --> 59:45.700]  Insert, I guess.
[59:45.720 --> 59:47.540]  Wait, but would pieces of the past have something...
[59:48.140 --> 59:49.040]  Or is this like a picture of the past?
[59:49.040 --> 59:50.040]  It's just a picture, I think.
[59:51.000 --> 59:52.440]  Yeah, he was born in 1831.
[59:52.440 --> 59:54.060]  Oh, pieces of the past is the name of the box.
[59:54.140 --> 59:54.660]  I'm an idiot.
[59:54.820 --> 59:55.680]  God damn.
[59:56.360 --> 59:57.500]  That's so cool.
[59:57.840 --> 59:58.480]  I don't even know what to say.
[59:58.920 --> 01:00:01.640]  Other than thank you for tuning in to...
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.160]  I didn't think we would beat Shaq last week.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.700]  I certainly didn't think we could top a Shaquille O'Neal autograph.
[01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:10.680]  But Brianna Stewart has something to say about it.
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.440]  Don Zimmer relic.
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.240]  Fucking Pedro Martinez relic.
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:16.880]  We got a RIP card.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.540]  We got Al-K-Line.
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:21.440]  We got Vincent van Gogh.
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:23.260]  Jesus Christ.
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.240]  I have all this stuff.
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.640]  Oh, we got Ash Ketchum autograph.
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:27.320]  We got snorkeling.
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:28.480]  We got snorkeling.
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:29.120]  Fun in the sun.
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:30.260]  We got Wiffle Ball.
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.880]  We'll see you next time.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.440]  Hopefully next Monday on The Break Show when we'll open up more pieces of the past.
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.000]  Ooh.
