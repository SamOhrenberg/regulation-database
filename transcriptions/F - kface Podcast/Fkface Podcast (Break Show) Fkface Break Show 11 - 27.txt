[00:12.580 --> 00:16.280]  Hello and welcome to the Face Break Show.
[00:17.300 --> 00:20.180]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me as always, almost as always,
[00:20.580 --> 00:24.100]  my beautiful blushing bride, no longer my girlfriend,
[00:24.240 --> 00:26.240]  no longer my fiance, no longer my side piece,
[00:26.500 --> 00:27.540]  not my only piece.
[00:27.640 --> 00:28.700]  I'm still your slam piece, though.
[00:28.720 --> 00:29.640]  You are still my slam piece.
[00:30.040 --> 00:33.120]  And then, slam piece in waiting,
[00:33.820 --> 00:36.400]  our good friend Sammy from Best Friends Today,
[00:36.440 --> 00:38.040]  who's going to be sitting in with us today to talk about NBA.
[00:38.600 --> 00:39.680]  I'm the new side piece.
[00:39.940 --> 00:40.120]  Yeah.
[00:40.120 --> 00:41.700]  I'm just getting broken in.
[00:41.860 --> 00:42.040]  Yeah.
[00:45.060 --> 00:46.500]  I'm very excited to have you.
[00:46.740 --> 00:49.380]  You probably don't know this, but I'm a big fan of you guys.
[00:49.860 --> 00:52.820]  And I've enjoyed watching you guys run around the building
[00:52.820 --> 00:55.620]  and bring a little bit of youthful exuberance
[00:55.620 --> 01:00.140]  back into a company that's full of 40-year-olds now.
[01:00.440 --> 01:04.580]  I met you briefly at RTX with your daughter, Millie,
[01:04.800 --> 01:07.260]  who was very surprised to see you all there
[01:07.260 --> 01:09.520]  because she was like, why are there cool people here?
[01:10.340 --> 01:12.560]  And I was like, just go say hi.
[01:12.740 --> 01:14.460]  She's the same age as you guys, too.
[01:14.480 --> 01:15.860]  She's going to die when she sees us, too.
[01:15.860 --> 01:17.540]  She's such a fucking fan of you three.
[01:18.260 --> 01:20.940]  Before you guys formed your super group here at RTX,
[01:21.060 --> 01:21.960]  she already knew about you guys,
[01:21.980 --> 01:22.920]  and when I told her you guys were working here,
[01:22.940 --> 01:23.880]  she just lost her mind.
[01:24.240 --> 01:24.800]  Sorry, Millie.
[01:24.980 --> 01:25.740]  Sorry, that was embarrassing.
[01:25.760 --> 01:26.860]  Here is so cool.
[01:27.520 --> 01:28.240]  Everyone here.
[01:29.260 --> 01:30.820]  I just want to prove that.
[01:33.840 --> 01:35.000]  Is there a but?
[01:35.180 --> 01:37.760]  No, there's no but because I'm the side piece.
[01:37.980 --> 01:38.580]  That's true.
[01:41.780 --> 01:43.100]  I'm still getting broken in.
[01:43.240 --> 01:44.840]  Yeah, it's good.
[01:45.020 --> 01:46.840]  You're going to sit in today because I suspect
[01:46.840 --> 01:48.360]  Eric doesn't like to do this show.
[01:48.540 --> 01:48.960]  That's okay.
[01:49.180 --> 01:50.480]  He keeps finding guests.
[01:50.780 --> 01:52.060]  Every week he finds a new guest,
[01:52.220 --> 01:53.140]  so he doesn't have to be on it.
[01:53.480 --> 01:54.940]  But I prefer, I'll be honest, I like you more.
[01:55.160 --> 01:56.420]  So that's easy.
[01:57.060 --> 01:59.340]  Before we get going, you know what we usually do
[01:59.340 --> 02:01.740]  is we show the hits from the previous week
[02:01.740 --> 02:02.760]  and then I tell you how much they're worth.
[02:03.380 --> 02:04.580]  We haven't done one of these in a little bit
[02:04.580 --> 02:07.540]  because the last one we did was at Extra Life
[02:07.540 --> 02:09.740]  when we emptied the pack sack,
[02:09.960 --> 02:13.120]  which turns out had a lot of hits in it.
[02:13.220 --> 02:13.700]  A lot.
[02:13.980 --> 02:15.160]  Like five autos.
[02:15.540 --> 02:15.800]  Yeah.
[02:15.920 --> 02:17.960]  And we dumped them all in pickle juice.
[02:17.980 --> 02:18.740]  We saved them.
[02:19.000 --> 02:20.580]  Yeah, we preserved them in pickle juice.
[02:20.600 --> 02:21.380]  Where is our pickle juice?
[02:21.460 --> 02:22.140]  Ruined them.
[02:23.080 --> 02:25.340]  However, I will say, I don't have the exact figure
[02:25.340 --> 02:27.540]  in front of me, but that 90 minutes where we did that
[02:27.540 --> 02:29.200]  raised I think $31,000.
[02:29.520 --> 02:29.660]  Yeah.
[02:29.940 --> 02:31.960]  So, yeah, so thank you for the audience
[02:31.960 --> 02:35.940]  for donating to the cause of, well, a good cause
[02:35.940 --> 02:38.960]  of helping sick kids, but also to destroy me
[02:39.720 --> 02:41.720]  by destroying some really nice cards.
[02:42.160 --> 02:44.100]  Y'all had a fun segment on Right Before Us
[02:44.100 --> 02:45.100]  where you played Operation.
[02:45.500 --> 02:47.280]  Yeah, and we had shock collars on.
[02:47.460 --> 02:48.740]  Oh, it looked brutal.
[02:48.920 --> 02:49.680]  It was miserable.
[02:51.260 --> 02:55.040]  Full disclosure, it didn't hurt as much as you think it does,
[02:55.520 --> 02:57.700]  but my reaction was so genuine
[02:58.280 --> 03:01.400]  because part of it was the anticipation of getting shocked.
[03:01.460 --> 03:01.660]  Yeah.
[03:02.320 --> 03:05.160]  And I had already reacted, but in my mind I'm like,
[03:05.160 --> 03:06.440]  oh, this is bullshit.
[03:06.820 --> 03:10.200]  But before, I'm like, oh, fuck, I'm gonna die.
[03:10.760 --> 03:12.400]  Well, you don't know when it's gonna happen.
[03:12.660 --> 03:13.060]  No.
[03:13.580 --> 03:16.960]  And Armando, if we know Armando, he's a monster.
[03:17.280 --> 03:17.440]  Yeah.
[03:17.520 --> 03:20.880]  And he kept shocking me when I shouldn't have been shocked.
[03:21.300 --> 03:21.460]  Oh.
[03:22.600 --> 03:26.340]  I gotta be honest, we've had shock collar content
[03:26.340 --> 03:28.080]  at Rooster Teeth here for about 14 years.
[03:28.220 --> 03:30.420]  I have never put one of those things on.
[03:30.680 --> 03:30.960]  You don't?
[03:31.020 --> 03:32.400]  I've dodged it the entire time.
[03:32.760 --> 03:34.920]  You don't like being electrocuted.
[03:34.920 --> 03:35.880]  I don't want to be.
[03:36.020 --> 03:38.040]  You wouldn't even let me hit you with the little fly swatter at home.
[03:38.200 --> 03:39.720]  Nope. The electric fly swatter? Absolutely not.
[03:40.040 --> 03:41.620]  Does that electrocute people?
[03:42.260 --> 03:42.580]  No.
[03:42.860 --> 03:43.720]  It'll give you a little shock.
[03:43.780 --> 03:46.200]  But it'll electrocute the flies as he hits, like, a racket.
[03:46.420 --> 03:46.920]  Here's the deal.
[03:46.980 --> 03:52.580]  When I was in high school, I worked at a electronic, pneumatic, and hydraulic tool repair shop.
[03:52.660 --> 03:53.400]  It was a one-man shop.
[03:53.460 --> 03:54.960]  You'd bring in a tool, like a hammer drill.
[03:55.200 --> 03:56.660]  We would take it apart and we would fix it.
[03:56.820 --> 04:02.800]  In the course of that job, I got electrocuted at least three times a day.
[04:03.560 --> 04:04.900]  Every single day I worked.
[04:04.960 --> 04:05.960]  And I worked six days a week.
[04:06.440 --> 04:09.300]  And so for almost two years, I would go to work every day and I would say,
[04:09.400 --> 04:10.680]  Today's the day I don't get electrocuted.
[04:10.820 --> 04:12.820]  And I would get electrocuted more for saying it.
[04:13.260 --> 04:20.520]  And so by the time I graduated high school, I had such a fear of electricity that I want nothing to do with it.
[04:20.700 --> 04:22.880]  Snakes and electricity, I'm not interested in, in the least.
[04:23.400 --> 04:24.520]  Well, I do have a present.
[04:25.040 --> 04:27.240]  It's a big snake in my pocket.
[04:27.460 --> 04:28.800]  We call this an electric snake.
[04:28.800 --> 04:35.820]  Was there a sign that said days without being electrocuted and you'd have to cross it out and put zero hours?
[04:36.060 --> 04:39.760]  Yeah, I just, I got sick of updating it because I was the only employee and I was still having to update it every day.
[04:40.380 --> 04:44.340]  Also, before we get going, I want you guys to know that we have some stuff on sale.
[04:44.680 --> 04:47.780]  It's the holidays. I think it's Cyber Monday. Is that what today is?
[04:47.900 --> 04:48.320]  Oh, yeah.
[04:48.500 --> 04:49.760]  Today is Cyber, the Cyber Monday.
[04:50.060 --> 04:53.340]  So there's probably a ton of shit on sale on the Rooster Teeth store.
[04:53.560 --> 04:57.740]  A ton of face merchandise. Don't buy that one.
[04:58.480 --> 05:02.880]  We got the nacho helmet or the, it's the group, the party...
[05:02.880 --> 05:03.460]  The group gurp.
[05:03.560 --> 05:04.880]  The group gurp, the party gurp.
[05:05.080 --> 05:08.560]  If you want to fill, you can fit a six pack of soda in this or beer if that's your thing.
[05:08.860 --> 05:09.480]  It's a gurpler.
[05:09.880 --> 05:13.820]  We don't have a regulation one. We have only fan-made ones.
[05:14.040 --> 05:17.060]  Yeah, we sell the greatest drinking vessel on earth.
[05:17.060 --> 05:18.100]  So I'm gurpin'.
[05:18.100 --> 05:18.960]  Yeah, you're gurpin'.
[05:18.960 --> 05:19.020]  Yeah.
[05:19.260 --> 05:19.580]  Okay.
[05:19.800 --> 05:20.620]  Every day you're gurpin'.
[05:20.620 --> 05:25.220]  And then if you want a group gurp, you can get one of these, fill it up and then gurp all night long.
[05:26.160 --> 05:28.860]  But in addition to that, we also have something I'm very excited about.
[05:28.940 --> 05:33.840]  And I understand we have about 1,300 of them left to sell because you guys are like, you never order enough.
[05:33.940 --> 05:34.540]  So we did.
[05:34.720 --> 05:38.480]  And now I have 13, I have a warehouse full of clocks I can't fuckin' do anything with.
[05:38.720 --> 05:45.620]  So please, if you are interested at all in a Slop O'Clock clock, hey, it's Slop O'Clock somewhere.
[05:46.180 --> 05:46.900]  All the time.
[05:46.960 --> 05:48.100]  Please Slop responsibly.
[05:48.280 --> 05:49.180]  Please Slop responsibly.
[05:50.000 --> 05:51.040]  Pick one of those bad boys up.
[05:51.140 --> 05:53.440]  And if you don't know, 11.15 is official Slop O'Clock time.
[05:53.440 --> 05:58.620]  I believe that's why you only see the 11 and the 3 on the clock, because it's the only time that matters.
[05:58.860 --> 05:58.940]  Yeah.
[05:59.620 --> 06:01.640]  Now, Sammy, we're gonna get into it.
[06:02.540 --> 06:07.400]  Since I don't have any cards from the previous week's hits to show, I want to show something a little special.
[06:08.140 --> 06:09.460]  A while back...
[06:09.460 --> 06:13.400]  Did you collect cards at all? You ever collected sports cards? Or Pokemon or any of that shit?
[06:13.600 --> 06:14.520]  I had Pokemon cards.
[06:14.600 --> 06:16.540]  Did you take care of them or did you just play them?
[06:17.100 --> 06:20.460]  I was too young to know the concept of taking care of anything.
[06:20.680 --> 06:21.500]  So you enjoyed them?
[06:21.500 --> 06:24.860]  Yes, I enjoyed, like, this is a cool card. Then it'd get ripped up in a week.
[06:25.140 --> 06:26.660]  That's all that matters. You had fun with it.
[06:26.980 --> 06:34.800]  Well, I have long collected cards since I was a kid, but I've never sent cards off to get graded.
[06:34.900 --> 06:36.720]  And a lot of people in the audience never had either.
[06:36.880 --> 06:43.840]  And so we decided as a test to send some cards off to PSA, which is the number one grader, and get them graded and see what that process is like.
[06:43.900 --> 06:45.480]  This is about three weeks ago to a month ago now.
[06:45.680 --> 06:47.400]  Yeah, it actually came back a lot faster than I thought.
[06:47.400 --> 06:51.400]  I've had them at the house for a week. I opened the box, not realizing what it was, but...
[06:52.020 --> 06:53.760]  Because it didn't say PSA on them.
[06:53.920 --> 07:00.740]  Yeah, I haven't looked inside. We are now going to officially reveal, unbox our three cards that we got graded and see what the values are.
[07:02.020 --> 07:05.540]  I can never figure out what my sounds are. I'm working on it.
[07:05.660 --> 07:07.740]  Don't you remember who you got, Emily, who you got?
[07:08.640 --> 07:10.640]  We got the... you got the Andrew Ripp in there?
[07:11.880 --> 07:12.240]  Uh...
[07:12.240 --> 07:12.900]  That should be in there.
[07:13.360 --> 07:14.920]  Oh, I have this.
[07:14.980 --> 07:16.160]  Oh, my dick's wet.
[07:16.700 --> 07:17.020]  What?!
[07:17.020 --> 07:17.640]  What's that from?
[07:17.740 --> 07:19.780]  I don't know. It's Carrie Wet Dick, is what it's called.
[07:19.960 --> 07:20.900]  Oh, yeah, Carrie.
[07:21.380 --> 07:21.620]  Ooh.
[07:21.860 --> 07:22.500]  Carrie's dick's wet.
[07:22.740 --> 07:23.060]  Oh, here.
[07:23.120 --> 07:23.640]  It's wet a lot.
[07:23.740 --> 07:25.240]  It squirted in my mouth, Daddy. Fuck.
[07:25.340 --> 07:25.680]  It was Eric.
[07:25.860 --> 07:26.240]  It was Eric.
[07:26.520 --> 07:26.840]  What?
[07:28.160 --> 07:29.820]  I don't have the Ripp on here.
[07:30.720 --> 07:31.220]  It was there.
[07:31.220 --> 07:31.620]  Pussy Slay.
[07:32.840 --> 07:33.180]  It was there.
[07:33.180 --> 07:34.100]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[07:34.400 --> 07:35.060]  Ah, well, we'll find out.
[07:35.060 --> 07:36.060]  Are these from episodes?
[07:36.640 --> 07:37.680]  Yeah, just from different stuff.
[07:37.860 --> 07:38.380]  I'll give you one.
[07:40.560 --> 07:40.960]  That was good.
[07:41.020 --> 07:41.420]  I'll give you another one.
[07:41.440 --> 07:41.960]  That was really good.
[07:44.340 --> 07:45.060]  That's a good one.
[07:45.060 --> 07:45.800]  Mike, can we get this clip?
[07:46.820 --> 07:48.320]  So I got three cards graded.
[07:48.400 --> 07:49.060]  I got Emily.
[07:49.240 --> 07:50.060]  I got your...
[07:52.160 --> 07:52.520]  Ah!
[07:53.080 --> 07:53.300]  I'm so excited!
[07:53.300 --> 07:55.320]  Allen and Ginter Jet Ski card graded.
[07:55.380 --> 07:55.700]  Hell yeah.
[07:56.120 --> 08:00.100]  This might be the first graded Jet Ski card in history.
[08:00.180 --> 08:01.200]  Because I can't imagine anybody else would do that.
[08:01.200 --> 08:01.880]  It'll be the best one.
[08:01.920 --> 08:02.300]  Pay to do this.
[08:02.320 --> 08:02.720]  Let's see what we got.
[08:03.060 --> 08:04.080]  Oh, perfect!
[08:04.480 --> 08:04.840]  Oh, 10!
[08:05.620 --> 08:06.760]  TSA 10 Jet Ski.
[08:06.760 --> 08:07.500]  Fun in the sun.
[08:07.680 --> 08:08.320]  Fun in the sun.
[08:08.360 --> 08:09.580]  You got a perfect grade.
[08:09.800 --> 08:10.600]  Jim Minth.
[08:10.640 --> 08:11.380]  Look at that.
[08:11.440 --> 08:12.400]  That's us on the lake.
[08:12.400 --> 08:15.860]  That's why you need to come to the lake with us so we can go have fun in the sun.
[08:16.020 --> 08:16.580]  We're big Jet Skiers.
[08:16.800 --> 08:18.800]  This card was probably worth a dollar.
[08:18.840 --> 08:20.100]  It cost $20 to get it graded.
[08:20.220 --> 08:21.720]  Now this card's worth about $21.
[08:22.500 --> 08:23.140]  Hell yeah.
[08:23.360 --> 08:24.700]  Cost of the grading and the card.
[08:24.800 --> 08:25.500]  Look at that.
[08:25.880 --> 08:26.920]  Return on investment.
[08:27.160 --> 08:27.880]  Yeah, there you go.
[08:28.120 --> 08:29.020]  And it's got like a...
[08:29.020 --> 08:33.340]  This might be the only TSA 10 Fun in the Sun Jet Skiing Allen and Ginter card.
[08:33.340 --> 08:35.660]  Well, its value is out of the roof.
[08:35.860 --> 08:36.700]  It's one of one.
[08:36.780 --> 08:36.940]  Out of the roof?
[08:37.120 --> 08:37.760]  It's true to roof.
[08:38.160 --> 08:39.180]  True to roof.
[08:39.180 --> 08:42.420]  All right, next is our Mark McGuire Olympic card.
[08:42.520 --> 08:43.840]  The one that prompted all of this.
[08:43.980 --> 08:46.020]  The one that as a PSA 10 is worth about $5,500.
[08:46.020 --> 08:47.860]  This is one that we pulled on the show from...
[08:47.860 --> 08:48.340]  On the show.
[08:48.540 --> 08:49.060]  Let's see what we got.
[08:49.700 --> 08:50.060]  Eight.
[08:50.180 --> 08:50.540]  Eight.
[08:50.660 --> 08:51.180]  Dog shit.
[08:51.400 --> 08:52.260]  Is that dog shit?
[08:52.360 --> 08:52.940]  Yeah, it's not great.
[08:53.140 --> 08:54.300]  So it's not worth much.
[08:54.560 --> 08:55.300]  That's okay though.
[08:55.380 --> 08:57.660]  I do think this is probably better than an eight.
[08:57.760 --> 08:59.320]  I would have pinned it at a nine.
[08:59.400 --> 09:02.320]  They don't tell you why they graded it what they graded it?
[09:02.320 --> 09:04.900]  I think you can probably look it up on the website and it'll give you clues.
[09:04.980 --> 09:05.720]  But anyway, there you go.
[09:06.740 --> 09:06.980]  Wow.
[09:07.300 --> 09:08.420]  That was my first ever graded card.
[09:08.420 --> 09:08.760]  There you go.
[09:08.840 --> 09:09.100]  Right there.
[09:09.160 --> 09:09.420]  Awesome.
[09:09.460 --> 09:09.880]  That's exciting.
[09:10.000 --> 09:13.460]  And then I have never shown this card on the show before.
[09:13.640 --> 09:15.580]  It's one I've been holding on to for a long time.
[09:15.700 --> 09:17.800]  I bought it at a citywide garage sale.
[09:18.060 --> 09:22.280]  I only got it graded to prove its authenticity because I wasn't sure it was real.
[09:22.380 --> 09:23.420]  It's an often...
[09:25.820 --> 09:27.820]  What do you call it when you steal...
[09:27.820 --> 09:28.380]  Doop?
[09:28.460 --> 09:29.180]  Dooped card?
[09:30.540 --> 09:32.940]  My Larry Bird Magic Johnson rookie card.
[09:34.860 --> 09:36.360]  It got a four.
[09:36.780 --> 09:37.760]  Which is about right.
[09:37.760 --> 09:38.760]  That means it's not...
[09:38.760 --> 09:41.760]  But that's okay because what it did say is that it's real.
[09:42.000 --> 09:42.420]  Wow.
[09:42.460 --> 09:42.760]  It's authentic.
[09:43.240 --> 09:49.320]  So the card that I've been holding on to forever, thinking it was a real Larry Bird Magic Johnson rookie card, hoping it was.
[09:49.400 --> 09:50.380]  It is, but it's a four?
[09:50.680 --> 09:51.060]  It's a four.
[09:51.080 --> 09:52.320]  Well, they didn't take...
[09:52.320 --> 09:55.880]  Well, the back is really badly miscut.
[09:56.000 --> 09:59.360]  If an eight is bad, then a four is dog shit.
[09:59.360 --> 09:59.880]  Super bad.
[10:00.000 --> 10:00.580]  It's dog shit.
[10:00.800 --> 10:01.160]  Wow.
[10:01.280 --> 10:03.060]  But this card's from 1981, right?
[10:03.060 --> 10:03.980]  So it's old.
[10:04.040 --> 10:04.600]  That's a ten.
[10:04.760 --> 10:05.920]  That's worth, what, $21?
[10:05.920 --> 10:07.100]  And this thing...
[10:07.100 --> 10:07.120]  Perfect ten.
[10:07.120 --> 10:08.020]  I don't even make that much.
[10:08.360 --> 10:08.840]  Perfect ten.
[10:09.000 --> 10:12.860]  In perfect condition, this card's worth so many thousands of dollars that it gets...
[10:12.860 --> 10:15.400]  People make forgeries of it constantly.
[10:15.800 --> 10:17.640]  So I didn't know if I had a forgery or not.
[10:17.680 --> 10:20.220]  The only reason I got it graded was to find out if it was real.
[10:20.320 --> 10:20.540]  Right.
[10:21.200 --> 10:21.900]  And it was.
[10:22.100 --> 10:22.940]  So I'm pretty excited.
[10:23.420 --> 10:24.480]  What is the...
[10:24.480 --> 10:26.880]  When you looked it up, like if it was a PSA...
[10:26.880 --> 10:27.140]  Ten.
[10:27.360 --> 10:28.300]  Ten of that.
[10:28.320 --> 10:28.960]  I have no idea.
[10:29.160 --> 10:29.300]  Yeah.
[10:29.340 --> 10:30.360]  I'll look it up and get back to you on that.
[10:30.360 --> 10:30.520]  Yeah.
[10:30.640 --> 10:32.560]  A four's gotta be worth something, right?
[10:32.560 --> 10:33.600]  I paid $300 for it.
[10:33.640 --> 10:34.520]  I bet it's worth about that.
[10:34.900 --> 10:35.240]  Okay.
[10:35.440 --> 10:36.600]  Probably worth about three or four hundred bucks.
[10:36.760 --> 10:37.100]  All right.
[10:37.200 --> 10:39.140]  That'll be a fun little loop around for next week.
[10:39.240 --> 10:44.300]  But for a Celtics fan, Larry Bird, Larry Legend, having his rookie card, like...
[10:44.300 --> 10:44.460]  Woof.
[10:44.640 --> 10:45.620]  And also Magic Johnson's no.
[10:45.660 --> 10:46.880]  Who's Julius Irving?
[10:47.000 --> 10:47.400]  Dr. J.
[10:47.880 --> 10:48.920]  Oh, I don't know about him.
[10:49.000 --> 10:49.360]  Dr. J?
[10:49.460 --> 10:50.420]  Oh, he was a great player.
[10:50.760 --> 10:52.060]  He played for Philadelphia.
[10:53.340 --> 10:56.100]  He was an enemy of the Celtics, obviously.
[10:56.200 --> 10:56.940]  Great basketball player.
[10:57.060 --> 10:57.340]  Ooh.
[10:59.060 --> 10:59.550]  Do the 76ers...
[11:00.600 --> 11:02.880]  I know there's Lakers, Celtics situation.
[11:03.100 --> 11:03.220]  Yes.
[11:03.220 --> 11:05.400]  And there's a 76ers-Celtics situation.
[11:05.860 --> 11:09.820]  Do the 76ers and Lakers team up against the Celtics, or do they hate each other as well?
[11:09.820 --> 11:11.360]  Like, it's 20 on 10.
[11:11.360 --> 11:11.660]  Yeah, yeah.
[11:11.660 --> 11:13.920]  They all get on the court to play the Celtics.
[11:13.960 --> 11:14.180]  Yeah.
[11:14.200 --> 11:15.280]  That's happened several times.
[11:15.300 --> 11:18.000]  Or do they all just hate each other?
[11:18.300 --> 11:23.640]  I don't know if the Lakers and the 76ers give a shit about each other or not.
[11:23.640 --> 11:24.680]  Do they know each other exists?
[11:24.800 --> 11:25.560]  I think they do.
[11:25.960 --> 11:28.060]  I don't think that there's a huge rivalry there.
[11:28.680 --> 11:32.400]  Lakers-Celtics is just, like, that's the quintessential NBA rivalry.
[11:32.760 --> 11:35.660]  But the Celtics' largest rivals are actually the 76ers.
[11:35.660 --> 11:36.480]  So it's just everyone against the Celtics.
[11:36.480 --> 11:38.180]  Because we're in the same division, so we play each other more.
[11:38.360 --> 11:38.580]  Yeah.
[11:39.080 --> 11:40.420]  It's Detroit versus everybody.
[11:40.600 --> 11:41.020]  That's true.
[11:41.100 --> 11:41.640]  That's what they say.
[11:41.820 --> 11:43.340]  That's everybody and everybody.
[11:43.480 --> 11:46.060]  But, like, nobody likes the Celtics in the NBA.
[11:46.900 --> 11:47.260]  I...
[11:48.020 --> 11:49.080]  I mean, most...
[11:49.080 --> 11:49.840]  Because they're so good.
[11:49.960 --> 11:50.500]  Here's the deal.
[11:50.560 --> 11:55.200]  There's 30 teams in the NBA and there's only one Celtic, so there's 29 teams of losers who don't like them, sure.
[11:55.340 --> 11:56.320]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[11:56.460 --> 11:57.260]  It's lonely at the top.
[11:57.340 --> 12:01.680]  There's about 340 people in the NBA that don't get to be Celtics, so they're all pretty bummed about it.
[12:01.680 --> 12:01.840]  Ooh!
[12:02.060 --> 12:02.420]  Hallelujah!
[12:03.260 --> 12:03.740]  Yes!
[12:04.540 --> 12:08.360]  So, Sammy, you're our Lakers fan, but I think you're mostly a LeBron fan, right?
[12:08.680 --> 12:09.980]  Ah, now that's out in the open.
[12:10.840 --> 12:13.300]  Yeah, I like to say that I...
[12:13.780 --> 12:15.140]  I can explain.
[12:15.580 --> 12:16.760]  I'm from Ohio.
[12:17.640 --> 12:18.500]  I saw LeBron.
[12:19.040 --> 12:19.880]  I saw him grow up.
[12:20.460 --> 12:21.820]  We have the same birthday.
[12:22.080 --> 12:22.720]  OK, congrats.
[12:22.740 --> 12:23.720]  December 30th.
[12:24.080 --> 12:26.220]  Me and LeBron are like... we're like this.
[12:26.740 --> 12:27.720]  We're locked in.
[12:27.840 --> 12:27.940]  Yeah.
[12:28.480 --> 12:30.600]  So all that to say, yes, I'm a LeBron fan.
[12:30.600 --> 12:32.540]  Wherever he goes, I think I'll be there.
[12:32.640 --> 12:34.920]  So you'd be like a Miami Heat fan if he was still there.
[12:35.360 --> 12:37.700]  Yeah, I was not betrayed as a...
[12:37.700 --> 12:38.700]  One, I think I was 12.
[12:39.060 --> 12:39.580]  You were 11.
[12:39.680 --> 12:43.760]  Yeah, I wasn't betrayed by the decision, because I was like, you do you, man.
[12:44.140 --> 12:45.040]  Miami's so beautiful.
[12:45.400 --> 12:46.360]  Have fun over there.
[12:46.480 --> 12:47.060]  Hey, you know what?
[12:47.300 --> 12:49.340]  I'm not a Cleveland fan.
[12:49.340 --> 12:50.300]  I don't dislike Cleveland.
[12:50.500 --> 12:52.420]  I like a lot of the players on Cleveland.
[12:52.500 --> 12:53.520]  I really like Evan Mobley a lot.
[12:54.540 --> 12:56.460]  And everybody likes Darius Garland.
[12:56.540 --> 12:57.520]  He's like one of the most likable guys.
[12:57.520 --> 13:01.860]  But I don't hate the Cavaliers at all.
[13:02.420 --> 13:05.280]  But I wouldn't consider myself a fan.
[13:05.620 --> 13:06.940]  But I gotta figure it's forgiven.
[13:07.340 --> 13:10.080]  He left, he came back, he brought a title to Cleveland.
[13:10.300 --> 13:11.960]  It's gotta be all water under the bridge, right?
[13:12.100 --> 13:13.400]  Those four years in Miami.
[13:13.860 --> 13:18.740]  I think as Cleveland fans, I think people have kind of gotten over it.
[13:18.940 --> 13:20.240]  Like, whatever, LeBron is back.
[13:20.420 --> 13:22.060]  But I think, who's the owner, Dan Gilbert?
[13:22.200 --> 13:22.380]  Yeah.
[13:22.780 --> 13:25.200]  He was salty when LeBron left.
[13:25.240 --> 13:25.840]  He was very salty.
[13:25.840 --> 13:28.340]  And I think he's still salty to this day.
[13:28.420 --> 13:30.020]  He's done a lot for Detroit, though.
[13:30.280 --> 13:31.940]  He's rebuilt downtown Detroit.
[13:32.120 --> 13:34.100]  He has done some infrastructure work in Detroit.
[13:34.200 --> 13:35.720]  But he hasn't made them a good basketball team, that's for sure.
[13:35.860 --> 13:37.240]  Well, he doesn't have anything to do with it.
[13:37.340 --> 13:40.440]  But we like Detroit and all the stuff. He's done with it.
[13:41.000 --> 13:41.340]  We do.
[13:41.440 --> 13:42.100]  That's all I care about.
[13:42.480 --> 13:43.740]  We're falling in love with Detroit.
[13:44.160 --> 13:45.340]  As a city or the Pistons?
[13:45.680 --> 13:46.480]  No, as a city.
[13:46.580 --> 13:46.960]  Oh, okay.
[13:47.100 --> 13:49.500]  I don't mind the Pistons, but they're a terrible fucking team.
[13:49.640 --> 13:53.880]  It's fun to go to a Pistons game because then you get to see really good teams play them for really cheap.
[13:53.880 --> 13:56.540]  Yep, $5 for front court seats.
[13:56.680 --> 13:59.660]  And we get to go to the Tigers. We get to see Shohei Otani play.
[13:59.840 --> 14:01.100]  Her parents live just outside of Detroit.
[14:01.320 --> 14:06.080]  So you can literally be in her dad's living room watching the Tigers play the Angels.
[14:06.380 --> 14:12.140]  Or like, I don't know, the Pistons play the Hawks.
[14:12.340 --> 14:15.200]  And at halftime be like, it's like 10 minutes to get down there.
[14:15.280 --> 14:15.680]  And we go buy tickets.
[14:15.960 --> 14:18.720]  We could be there in a seat before halftime's over.
[14:18.920 --> 14:19.300]  Wow.
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.760]  That was Cleveland when LeBron left.
[14:22.760 --> 14:26.540]  I think seats were like, they were giving them away.
[14:26.760 --> 14:28.300]  They were giving you food to sit in.
[14:28.600 --> 14:32.200]  Then Kyrie left and then it was just Kevin Love trying to hold it down.
[14:32.660 --> 14:33.900]  Was Tristan Thompson there?
[14:34.320 --> 14:34.880]  He's back.
[14:35.140 --> 14:36.240]  Yeah, he's back there.
[14:36.240 --> 14:36.840]  He's out of retirement.
[14:37.160 --> 14:39.820]  I think he's getting a lot of DNPs though.
[14:40.020 --> 14:41.280]  I don't think he's playing.
[14:41.720 --> 14:42.600]  What's DNP?
[14:42.700 --> 14:43.100]  Did not play.
[14:43.480 --> 14:44.120]  Did not play.
[14:44.160 --> 14:45.020]  He is a player though.
[14:45.300 --> 14:46.400]  He is a player. He's on the team.
[14:46.520 --> 14:46.840]  He's getting paid.
[14:46.880 --> 14:47.540]  No, but he's a player.
[14:48.780 --> 14:50.140]  He likes to make babies.
[14:50.140 --> 14:51.540]  Oh, yeah.
[14:51.860 --> 14:52.680]  He likes to cheat.
[14:52.780 --> 14:54.660]  But have you seen the quote of him?
[14:55.120 --> 14:58.160]  He says, man, when I cheat, I feel so bad.
[15:01.520 --> 15:06.800]  He's like, I felt bad that I had an affair the day before my girlfriend gave birth to our child.
[15:07.460 --> 15:07.800]  Again.
[15:08.520 --> 15:09.100]  A bit of a Kardashian.
[15:09.180 --> 15:10.500]  A bit of a Khloe fan over here.
[15:10.940 --> 15:11.420]  All right.
[15:11.580 --> 15:12.060]  Here's what we're going to do.
[15:12.240 --> 15:14.460]  In honor of Sami, we're going to open up some old tops.
[15:14.800 --> 15:16.360]  I pulled these out of the pack sack.
[15:16.640 --> 15:18.460]  He didn't see me do it though, so I'll put them back in.
[15:19.900 --> 15:20.700]  Oh, magic.
[15:21.740 --> 15:23.120]  These are 1988 tops.
[15:23.560 --> 15:26.320]  When we open up old cards like this, Sami, we're looking for one guy.
[15:26.480 --> 15:29.020]  We're looking for Don Zimmer.
[15:29.580 --> 15:29.760]  Okay.
[15:29.980 --> 15:33.180]  But first, before we open up, you have to have your communion.
[15:33.620 --> 15:34.140]  Oh, right.
[15:34.260 --> 15:34.780]  Here, I'll have some with you.
[15:34.820 --> 15:35.600]  What's wrong with it?
[15:35.600 --> 15:36.520]  Here, y'all can split it.
[15:36.540 --> 15:37.680]  This one's in good shape.
[15:38.160 --> 15:38.560]  What?
[15:38.660 --> 15:39.380]  It just snapped.
[15:39.720 --> 15:40.660]  Yeah, yeah.
[15:40.780 --> 15:43.100]  So you get to have gum and then you're part of the group.
[15:43.540 --> 15:47.200]  This gum has been in this wrapper since 1988.
[15:48.160 --> 15:54.420]  Willie Wilson, Mike LaCrosse, Henry Cotto, Mike Felder, Tim Mahalat, Alan Trammell.
[15:54.640 --> 15:54.780]  How is it?
[15:55.260 --> 15:56.420]  Is it good?
[15:57.280 --> 15:57.900]  It's not.
[15:57.960 --> 15:58.220]  It's crunchy, huh?
[15:58.320 --> 15:59.340]  Have you ever had crunchy gum?
[15:59.720 --> 16:00.080]  Mmm.
[16:00.640 --> 16:02.380]  You can spit it in the drip bucket.
[16:02.920 --> 16:04.760]  Or wherever he did that, in that box.
[16:04.780 --> 16:05.720]  Oh my God, that's terrible.
[16:05.720 --> 16:06.180]  It's pretty gross.
[16:06.300 --> 16:08.300]  It gives you a nice, like, aftertaste too.
[16:08.660 --> 16:09.200]  Oh, shit.
[16:09.720 --> 16:10.460]  Do you want a strawberry?
[16:10.820 --> 16:11.620]  Do you have a strawberry bar?
[16:11.760 --> 16:12.360]  It tastes like toenails.
[16:14.380 --> 16:15.540]  I don't know what that tastes like.
[16:15.540 --> 16:16.660]  This guy eats a lot of toenails.
[16:16.660 --> 16:17.100]  He would know.
[16:17.300 --> 16:18.020]  Is that the...
[16:18.020 --> 16:19.180]  Yeah, you can throw it in there.
[16:19.200 --> 16:19.700]  You can spit it in there.
[16:19.780 --> 16:20.920]  I think I have brain damage.
[16:21.700 --> 16:23.080]  Dodd, Baylor, J-Tibbs.
[16:23.400 --> 16:24.020]  Oh, here we go.
[16:24.100 --> 16:26.020]  Barry Bonds, Bobby Bonilla, Leaders.
[16:26.040 --> 16:27.680]  That's probably worth a buck or two.
[16:28.060 --> 16:29.160]  Oh, I'm so sorry.
[16:29.160 --> 16:29.600]  Gene Mott.
[16:29.860 --> 16:30.440]  Oh, it's okay.
[16:30.600 --> 16:31.420]  What year were you born?
[16:31.580 --> 16:31.860]  2002?
[16:32.480 --> 16:32.720]  Yeah.
[16:33.020 --> 16:33.300]  Okay.
[16:33.980 --> 16:34.960]  This is 1988.
[16:35.940 --> 16:37.680]  So, 14 years before you were born?
[16:37.960 --> 16:38.280]  Yeah.
[16:38.820 --> 16:40.680]  That's a little piece of history you just ingested.
[16:40.820 --> 16:41.220]  Congratulations.
[16:41.760 --> 16:43.100]  I was 14 back then.
[16:43.380 --> 16:43.920]  Negative 14.
[16:44.880 --> 16:45.320]  Christ.
[16:45.620 --> 16:47.620]  It doesn't get easier the more I do it.
[16:48.040 --> 16:52.760]  Andre Dawson, Curtis Wilkerson, Ken Williams, Geoff Manto, Cecil Fielder.
[16:53.020 --> 16:54.700]  One of the biggest butts in the history of baseball.
[16:54.700 --> 16:55.680]  That is a big butt.
[16:55.920 --> 16:56.760]  Cecil Fielder had a...
[16:56.760 --> 16:57.340]  Kyle Lowry in baseball.
[16:58.260 --> 16:59.140]  That's a great point.
[16:59.500 --> 17:01.520]  Kyle Lowry's juiciest booty in the NBA.
[17:01.760 --> 17:02.120]  Really?
[17:02.440 --> 17:03.240]  Especially for his size.
[17:03.660 --> 17:06.660]  Steve Olin, Scott Aldred, Bobby Thigpen.
[17:07.000 --> 17:07.420]  What?
[17:07.920 --> 17:08.740]  Oh, you like Thigpen?
[17:09.060 --> 17:09.500]  Thigpen?
[17:09.720 --> 17:10.440]  Yeah, he was a pitcher.
[17:10.560 --> 17:10.940]  You want to say that?
[17:11.000 --> 17:11.820]  That's a good name.
[17:13.280 --> 17:21.500]  Jim Acker, Kevin Sitzer, Chuck Terry, Rick Cerrone, Terry Mulholland, Lee Guterman, Gary Carter.
[17:21.620 --> 17:22.900]  We got no zims.
[17:23.040 --> 17:26.760]  That's okay though, because we got Barry Bonds, Bobby Bonilla, Pirates leaders.
[17:28.060 --> 17:30.700]  Speaking of juice, that's a juicy photo right there.
[17:30.780 --> 17:31.480]  You don't realize it.
[17:31.880 --> 17:32.900]  Who is that?
[17:32.980 --> 17:34.300]  That's Barry Bonds and that's Bobby Bonilla.
[17:34.540 --> 17:37.300]  Barry Bonds is one of the most prolific steroid users in the history of sports.
[17:37.300 --> 17:38.380]  He doesn't look like that.
[17:38.780 --> 17:40.920]  He didn't look like that by the end of his career.
[17:40.920 --> 17:41.480]  No, he didn't.
[17:41.520 --> 17:42.420]  That was the steroids.
[17:42.580 --> 17:44.520]  Yeah, but he had worms.
[17:45.340 --> 17:47.040]  That's what Fanda Tatis...
[17:47.800 --> 17:54.040]  One of the guys in San Diego got busted for steroids and he said it was because he had worms.
[17:54.380 --> 17:55.920]  He was taking medication for worms.
[17:56.160 --> 17:58.300]  He was taking performance enhancing drugs for the worms?
[17:58.480 --> 18:00.200]  So the worms got really strong?
[18:00.360 --> 18:00.540]  Yeah.
[18:00.640 --> 18:00.880]  Apparently.
[18:01.960 --> 18:04.900]  I didn't mean to take them to get better in a sport.
[18:05.160 --> 18:07.040]  He got to take like eight months off of baseball for that.
[18:07.260 --> 18:09.480]  Okay, I'm excited.
[18:09.880 --> 18:11.760]  I've assembled a whole bunch of basketball.
[18:11.960 --> 18:15.640]  We're fucking already 20 minutes into this and we haven't opened really anything yet.
[18:15.660 --> 18:16.540]  So let's just dive in.
[18:18.020 --> 18:19.220]  I'm very excited about this.
[18:19.460 --> 18:21.700]  Maybe we should hold off to open this last, but we're not gonna.
[18:21.820 --> 18:22.500]  We're gonna open it first.
[18:22.740 --> 18:24.680]  What we have here is NBA hoops.
[18:24.740 --> 18:26.140]  Sammy 23, 24.
[18:26.800 --> 18:28.400]  This is Hobby Box.
[18:28.580 --> 18:30.540]  I went and bought this today from the card shop.
[18:30.720 --> 18:31.460]  You went to the card shop?
[18:31.500 --> 18:32.440]  Card Traders in Austin.
[18:32.580 --> 18:34.660]  If you ever get a chance, go down there and support those people.
[18:34.660 --> 18:35.320]  They're so nice.
[18:35.420 --> 18:35.820]  They're lovely.
[18:36.320 --> 18:37.640]  So this is the...
[18:37.640 --> 18:38.780]  They've got that Pokemon shit too.
[18:38.780 --> 18:43.800]  The first Panini NBA product that's gonna have the new rookie class in it.
[18:43.840 --> 18:45.100]  So we're looking for Auster Thompson.
[18:46.000 --> 18:47.860]  We're looking for Eamon Thompson and the Thompson twins.
[18:48.020 --> 18:51.180]  We're looking for Brandon Miller, who played for Alabama.
[18:51.300 --> 18:52.660]  Now he plays for Charlotte.
[18:53.320 --> 18:56.760]  I believe he's in a civil suit right now for a wrongful death.
[18:57.460 --> 18:58.760]  That's gonna cost him a lot of money.
[18:58.960 --> 18:59.500]  Scoot be in there?
[18:59.820 --> 19:00.800]  Scoot will be in here.
[19:00.920 --> 19:02.500]  The only bullshit about this...
[19:02.500 --> 19:03.760]  And Wimby will be in here.
[19:05.020 --> 19:06.040]  Wimby doesn't auto.
[19:06.440 --> 19:09.160]  He doesn't sign any autos and hoops this year.
[19:09.280 --> 19:09.440]  Like LeBron.
[19:09.940 --> 19:10.720]  Yeah, like LeBron.
[19:11.000 --> 19:13.520]  There is some speculation that he signed...
[19:13.520 --> 19:20.880]  I think it's known that he signed with Fanatics, who is the competitor to Panini, right?
[19:21.140 --> 19:23.840]  And I think he won't be signing any Panini products this year.
[19:23.920 --> 19:28.800]  They'll still be good cards to pull, but you're gonna have to buy weird top shit like Allen and Ginter to get his auto, I think.
[19:29.600 --> 19:30.700]  At least to my knowledge.
[19:30.760 --> 19:34.260]  He hasn't signed anything for Panini yet, which is a bummer.
[19:34.260 --> 19:38.840]  But we can still get a lot of money out of Wimby cards if we get any.
[19:39.420 --> 19:43.300]  The twins, are they the ones that went second in the draft?
[19:43.760 --> 19:44.360]  The twins?
[19:44.680 --> 19:45.600]  You said they were...
[19:45.600 --> 19:47.040]  Oh, the twins!
[19:47.340 --> 19:48.280]  The Thompson twins.
[19:48.860 --> 19:51.840]  They went like fourth and seventh or something?
[19:51.840 --> 19:52.420]  That sounds right.
[19:52.580 --> 19:54.380]  I remember we watched it, whoever went second.
[19:54.980 --> 19:58.280]  I have not seen these cards yet. I haven't opened them yet, I haven't seen them yet, so I'm very excited.
[20:00.040 --> 20:01.080]  Jaden McDaniels.
[20:01.380 --> 20:02.940]  Scary Terry, Terry Rozier.
[20:03.520 --> 20:04.460]  Ex-Celtic.
[20:04.740 --> 20:11.600]  Kind of just slowly dying in Charlotte like all the other talented people that get stuck in that city.
[20:12.240 --> 20:15.460]  James Wiseman, speaking of talented, he doesn't fit the bill.
[20:15.800 --> 20:16.160]  Damn!
[20:17.480 --> 20:18.400]  Come on, dude.
[20:18.420 --> 20:20.060]  He was okay on the Warriors.
[20:21.020 --> 20:22.460]  He doesn't have a chance.
[20:22.660 --> 20:27.060]  He's getting a lot of chances in Detroit, and unfortunately he's not making much of them.
[20:27.700 --> 20:30.020]  Listen, I want the dude, the dude's like seven feet tall.
[20:30.220 --> 20:32.520]  He's built like a skinny Embiid, who I know you're a fan of.
[20:32.700 --> 20:36.260]  I would love James Wiseman to become NBA ready, but he's...
[20:36.260 --> 20:37.360]  I don't know if he's going to get there.
[20:37.580 --> 20:39.560]  SGA, best point guard in the NBA.
[20:40.100 --> 20:41.480]  I think people are still sleeping on him.
[20:41.800 --> 20:42.620]  Shy Gildish Alexander.
[20:43.400 --> 20:44.540]  Just watch one game.
[20:45.000 --> 20:46.100]  The guy's just phenomenal.
[20:46.220 --> 20:46.640]  Got the aura.
[20:46.920 --> 20:48.420]  Yeah, he does. He's got the aura, that's a good way to put it.
[20:49.220 --> 20:51.700]  What was it that you were telling me about the guy who looks like Timothee Chalamet?
[20:52.280 --> 20:53.840]  Oh, never mind, never mind.
[20:55.180 --> 20:57.020]  The weekly sports controversy.
[20:57.280 --> 21:00.200]  Yeah, Josh Giddey, forward for OKC.
[21:00.300 --> 21:01.040]  We'll see what happens.
[21:01.420 --> 21:02.140]  We'll see what happens.
[21:03.340 --> 21:05.320]  He's gotten himself... there's an investigation.
[21:05.640 --> 21:07.300]  I just remembered, I thought it was something else.
[21:07.300 --> 21:08.660]  I hope we don't pull him.
[21:09.520 --> 21:13.760]  Max Struess, for the Cleveland Cavaliers, came over from the Miami Heat.
[21:13.920 --> 21:15.920]  The dilapidated Miami Heat.
[21:16.720 --> 21:17.800]  Andrew Wiggins.
[21:20.500 --> 21:21.040]  Kobe...
[21:21.040 --> 21:22.040]  He's a Huffkin rookie.
[21:24.440 --> 21:26.620]  Oh, and a Zion seed.
[21:27.540 --> 21:29.200]  Talk about washed up.
[21:29.520 --> 21:29.740]  What?
[21:31.820 --> 21:32.660]  He can't play.
[21:33.400 --> 21:34.320]  It's all that gumbo.
[21:35.720 --> 21:37.380]  He's been enjoying that gumbo, that's for sure.
[21:37.380 --> 21:38.220]  It's all that crawfish.
[21:38.440 --> 21:39.840]  His knees can't support it.
[21:40.160 --> 21:41.960]  That's a lot of gumbo. His feet can't support it.
[21:41.980 --> 21:44.080]  We got to see him play, though, on the day Kobe died.
[21:44.360 --> 21:45.520]  Dude, you wanna hear an NBA story?
[21:46.120 --> 21:49.180]  The day Kobe Bryant died, we were in New Orleans with her parents
[21:49.180 --> 21:52.080]  because I wanted to see Zion play in his rookie season.
[21:52.320 --> 21:53.020]  Against the Celtics.
[21:53.380 --> 21:55.240]  So we went to go see him play against the Celtics
[21:55.240 --> 21:58.620]  and we were in the cab going to the game
[21:58.620 --> 22:00.760]  when they announced Kobe died in a helicopter crash.
[22:00.760 --> 22:02.040]  We got in the cab and the guy was like,
[22:02.100 --> 22:03.660]  I'm sorry, I have to listen to the radio.
[22:03.940 --> 22:05.700]  I think they just said Kobe Bryant died.
[22:06.020 --> 22:09.240]  And I thought Geoff was gonna run to the front of the car.
[22:09.380 --> 22:10.120]  He was like, what?
[22:10.380 --> 22:14.200]  So then we literally go into the Mercedes arena or whatever it is
[22:14.200 --> 22:16.900]  where New Orleans plays.
[22:16.900 --> 22:21.540]  And it was just like the heaviest thing I've ever experienced.
[22:21.540 --> 22:23.120]  The entire place was silent.
[22:23.240 --> 22:24.420]  They did the moment of silence for him.
[22:24.500 --> 22:25.960]  It was just like, it was awful.
[22:26.200 --> 22:26.580]  It was awful.
[22:27.320 --> 22:27.720]  Anyways.
[22:28.360 --> 22:28.760]  Anyway.
[22:29.800 --> 22:30.580]  James Harden.
[22:30.880 --> 22:31.400]  He's awful.
[22:31.620 --> 22:32.080]  James Harden.
[22:32.400 --> 22:33.620]  Did we just fart for Harden?
[22:33.760 --> 22:34.060]  Yeah.
[22:34.340 --> 22:35.260]  We also got his jersey.
[22:35.520 --> 22:36.440]  Did we throw it away already?
[22:36.500 --> 22:38.480]  Dude, we got a signed Harden jersey last week.
[22:38.480 --> 22:39.220]  For the 76ers.
[22:39.320 --> 22:41.180]  It's the ultimate fuckface move.
[22:41.280 --> 22:42.700]  He wanted so desperately to go there
[22:42.700 --> 22:44.500]  and then he didn't want to fucking be there.
[22:44.960 --> 22:45.800]  Now he's a clipper.
[22:46.280 --> 22:50.940]  I will say, since Westbrook decided to come off the bench,
[22:51.040 --> 22:51.980]  they're 4-1, I believe.
[22:52.340 --> 22:52.820]  That's good.
[22:53.200 --> 22:55.080]  I think it has a lot to do with Westbrook being a team player
[22:55.500 --> 22:57.320]  and James Harden continuing to be...
[22:57.320 --> 22:59.640]  Yeah, a phrase, if everybody's the asshole, maybe you're the asshole.
[22:59.920 --> 23:00.080]  Yeah.
[23:00.580 --> 23:01.860]  Well, Harden's the system.
[23:02.120 --> 23:02.600]  That's what he said.
[23:03.280 --> 23:04.220]  He's the system.
[23:04.260 --> 23:04.840]  He's the system.
[23:05.420 --> 23:06.000]  Jamal Murray.
[23:06.100 --> 23:06.900]  I think he's hurt right now.
[23:07.060 --> 23:07.840]  I love Jamal Murray, though.
[23:08.160 --> 23:11.680]  Likes to take sex videos.
[23:12.380 --> 23:12.740]  What?
[23:13.160 --> 23:13.640]  Does he?
[23:13.860 --> 23:15.680]  Yeah, he's got a couple of blowjob videos out there.
[23:15.680 --> 23:16.080]  What?
[23:16.700 --> 23:17.980]  From his POV?
[23:18.180 --> 23:18.340]  Yeah.
[23:18.580 --> 23:21.180]  I'm so shocked that that's what you said.
[23:21.500 --> 23:22.120]  Because I knew...
[23:22.120 --> 23:23.240]  Oh, sorry, NBA champion as well.
[23:23.380 --> 23:24.460]  Yeah, NBA champion.
[23:25.540 --> 23:26.260]  Getting his...
[23:26.260 --> 23:27.320]  He's the side piece, I guess.
[23:27.400 --> 23:29.500]  He knows what I'm interested in, where I'm like, what?
[23:29.900 --> 23:30.900]  Yeah, that did happen.
[23:31.000 --> 23:32.620]  I think he posted it accidentally.
[23:32.740 --> 23:33.060]  He did.
[23:33.160 --> 23:33.820]  He posted it accidentally.
[23:33.900 --> 23:35.140]  On his Instagram story.
[23:35.240 --> 23:36.680]  Yeah, he got busted because he was...
[23:36.680 --> 23:38.560]  Like he did it live or he just posted it?
[23:38.700 --> 23:40.180]  No, it was just like a video, yeah.
[23:40.220 --> 23:42.440]  But it showed his fucking lock screen, so he saw who it was.
[23:43.980 --> 23:44.700]  Jabari Walker.
[23:46.760 --> 23:47.480]  Jake Laravia.
[23:48.620 --> 23:49.340]  DeAndre Hunter.
[23:49.640 --> 23:51.180]  Got his ass kicked by the Celtics the other day.
[23:53.480 --> 23:54.200]  Trey Jones.
[23:54.680 --> 23:55.820]  Ooh, Taylor Hendricks.
[23:55.980 --> 23:56.660]  That's a Celtic.
[23:57.500 --> 23:57.960]  Trey Jones?
[23:58.220 --> 23:59.640]  No, that's Jalen Brown right there.
[23:59.800 --> 23:59.960]  Yeah.
[24:00.240 --> 24:01.960]  He's about to stuff it down Trey Jones' face.
[24:02.600 --> 24:03.320]  Lonnie Walker.
[24:04.720 --> 24:05.440]  Purple, parallel...
[24:05.440 --> 24:05.960]  Underrated.
[24:07.500 --> 24:09.440]  These hoops cards, you gotta look at the back.
[24:09.500 --> 24:10.700]  If you get a red back, they're worth more money.
[24:10.740 --> 24:11.240]  What's underrated?
[24:11.320 --> 24:11.660]  Lonnie Walker?
[24:11.680 --> 24:12.320]  Lonnie Walker.
[24:12.480 --> 24:12.920]  You think so?
[24:12.920 --> 24:13.360]  Yeah.
[24:13.480 --> 24:14.240]  For sure.
[24:15.040 --> 24:15.480]  He's...
[24:15.480 --> 24:20.980]  I don't think he's a six man right now, but he's putting up six man of the year numbers.
[24:21.280 --> 24:22.180]  What does six man mean?
[24:22.860 --> 24:26.960]  Six man is the first person off the bench, like the person that you rely the most on.
[24:27.020 --> 24:29.060]  He's like the extra starter.
[24:29.320 --> 24:30.380]  So is it five versus five?
[24:30.440 --> 24:31.280]  I've never noticed that.
[24:31.400 --> 24:31.540]  I'm an idiot.
[24:31.540 --> 24:33.140]  It's five versus five.
[24:33.460 --> 24:34.720]  I just realized that.
[24:34.940 --> 24:35.420]  I don't count.
[24:35.500 --> 24:37.300]  Dylan Brooks is kind of an idiot.
[24:37.580 --> 24:38.220]  That's what they're running around.
[24:38.440 --> 24:41.640]  Dylan Brooks is the greatest villain.
[24:41.640 --> 24:42.320]  He is.
[24:42.320 --> 24:42.820]  He's great.
[24:42.960 --> 24:44.060]  That the NBA has ever seen.
[24:44.240 --> 24:45.100]  What's his villain story?
[24:45.340 --> 24:46.960]  Well, he played for Memphis.
[24:47.660 --> 24:49.220]  He's like a rabble rouser.
[24:49.420 --> 24:51.220]  Gets in a lot of trouble for trying to start fights.
[24:51.460 --> 24:51.820]  Kind of a dream.
[24:51.820 --> 24:52.420]  So he's with Microsoft now?
[24:53.320 --> 24:53.700]  No.
[24:53.980 --> 24:55.920]  Kind of like a wannabe Draymond Green.
[24:57.200 --> 24:58.480]  He doesn't choke people though.
[24:58.960 --> 25:00.360]  Yeah, but he hasn't choked anybody yet.
[25:00.720 --> 25:05.820]  He got into some trouble for trying to start a fight with LeBron, I believe, last year.
[25:06.160 --> 25:10.560]  Which was when Shannon Sharp got on the stage in his dad sweater and threatened to fight.
[25:10.580 --> 25:11.340]  It was a whole thing.
[25:11.340 --> 25:12.620]  Steven Adams got involved.
[25:14.100 --> 25:16.380]  The Grizzlies were fucking done with him.
[25:16.540 --> 25:19.280]  They were just sick of his bullshit and so they got rid of him in the offseason.
[25:19.420 --> 25:20.260]  He plays for Houston now.
[25:20.960 --> 25:22.780]  And Houston's actually pretty interesting.
[25:23.060 --> 25:24.720]  They're a lot of young talent there.
[25:25.400 --> 25:28.460]  You know, the disgraced ex-Celtics coach Imei Yudoka is there.
[25:29.900 --> 25:32.660]  Is anyone else going to the Rockets?
[25:32.820 --> 25:33.680]  Or maybe he's who...
[25:34.460 --> 25:35.980]  Fred Van Vliet went to the Rockets.
[25:35.980 --> 25:37.860]  Had some trouble and then they kind of get kicked down there.
[25:37.980 --> 25:38.340]  That's him.
[25:38.720 --> 25:39.300]  He had trouble.
[25:39.660 --> 25:40.340]  That was who it was.
[25:40.340 --> 25:41.220]  He's the project, yeah.
[25:41.620 --> 25:43.540]  Fred Van Vliet from Toronto Raptors went there as well.
[25:43.660 --> 25:44.460]  Also a big butt.
[25:45.280 --> 25:46.180]  Yeah, actually.
[25:46.540 --> 25:46.960]  Pretty big butt.
[25:47.080 --> 25:48.460]  Not a Kyle Lowry butt, but...
[25:48.460 --> 25:48.680]  No.
[25:49.500 --> 25:52.500]  Luka Doncic looking like he's about 50 in that photo.
[25:52.500 --> 25:53.820]  Is he doing this or is he doing this?
[25:53.980 --> 25:54.500]  I can't see.
[25:54.760 --> 25:55.840]  Oh no, he's doing this.
[25:55.920 --> 25:56.680]  I thought he was doing this.
[25:57.000 --> 25:57.480]  He's like...
[25:57.480 --> 25:58.280]  He's like...
[25:58.280 --> 25:59.680]  I thought he was being Colehan Luka again.
[26:00.460 --> 26:01.260]  Darius Garland.
[26:01.600 --> 26:02.960]  There you go, a little calf for you.
[26:03.480 --> 26:04.220]  Jalen Williams.
[26:04.420 --> 26:06.700]  Is that the good Jalen Williams or the other Jalen Williams?
[26:07.080 --> 26:08.840]  There's two Jalen Williams on the OKC.
[26:08.840 --> 26:09.940]  I can't...
[26:09.940 --> 26:11.100]  J Dub and J Will.
[26:11.260 --> 26:11.720]  That's the good one.
[26:11.880 --> 26:12.320]  That's the good one.
[26:13.540 --> 26:14.240]  Oh, here we go.
[26:14.320 --> 26:16.020]  NBA Hoops, Kevin Durant, Sunscriber.
[26:16.020 --> 26:17.540]  I haven't seen that insert before.
[26:17.880 --> 26:18.320]  That's cool.
[26:18.400 --> 26:18.740]  Wanna save it?
[26:19.280 --> 26:19.900]  Yeah, I'll put it over here.
[26:19.960 --> 26:20.780]  I'm a little pile over here.
[26:20.860 --> 26:21.120]  You wanna...
[26:21.120 --> 26:21.740]  Can I save this?
[26:21.820 --> 26:22.180]  Yeah, please.
[26:22.180 --> 26:26.080]  Someone said Dylan Brooks is Draymond Green without kicking people in the dick, but also
[26:26.080 --> 26:26.860]  without the talent.
[26:27.700 --> 26:29.300]  Dylan Brooks is a defensive anchor.
[26:29.560 --> 26:30.380]  He is a defensive anchor.
[26:30.460 --> 26:31.660]  I'll say this about Dylan Brooks.
[26:31.740 --> 26:32.560]  I don't like his ponytails.
[26:33.400 --> 26:34.500]  Yeah, I don't...
[26:34.500 --> 26:35.900]  I think the hair's not working.
[26:36.060 --> 26:36.980]  Yeah, that'll work for him, right?
[26:38.840 --> 26:40.140]  He's a Colby Jones rookie.
[26:40.380 --> 26:42.460]  It's got a fucking defect on it, so...
[26:42.460 --> 26:43.040]  What's the defect?
[26:43.260 --> 26:44.740]  I just got a print error in it.
[26:46.400 --> 26:47.200]  Joel Embiid.
[26:47.800 --> 26:48.680]  MVP this year.
[26:49.540 --> 26:50.640]  Wasn't he MVP last year?
[26:50.880 --> 26:51.080]  Yes.
[26:51.080 --> 26:51.940]  He's gonna repeat.
[26:52.140 --> 26:53.060]  He's gonna do it again.
[26:53.120 --> 26:56.800]  NBA Hoops, Steph Curry, Extreme Team.
[26:57.340 --> 27:00.720]  Now, this is some sort of a silver...
[27:00.720 --> 27:02.900]  or some sort of a foil insert.
[27:04.340 --> 27:07.180]  I've never seen this insert, Extreme Team, so I don't know if this is rare or not.
[27:07.180 --> 27:09.280]  It could be a K-set or it could just be super normal.
[27:09.560 --> 27:11.320]  But we'll sleeve it anyway and I'll find out.
[27:16.470 --> 27:17.610]  You watch a lot of basketball?
[27:18.190 --> 27:20.410]  Yeah, I watch a pretty decent amount.
[27:20.890 --> 27:23.850]  I, unfortunately, follow a lot of basketball on Twitter, too.
[27:24.150 --> 27:26.330]  The worst place to be for an NBA fan.
[27:27.370 --> 27:30.050]  NBA Twitter is probably the worst place on the planet.
[27:30.230 --> 27:33.050]  Do you follow all the alt accounts that they all have?
[27:33.930 --> 27:35.330]  Like the Sam Presti alt accounts?
[27:35.510 --> 27:35.670]  Yeah.
[27:35.850 --> 27:36.230]  Yes.
[27:36.590 --> 27:39.170]  The Stephen A. Smith learner account.
[27:41.090 --> 27:42.590]  Emanuel Quickley, very good player.
[27:43.410 --> 27:46.710]  Ben Simmons, this is gonna be his redemption year.
[27:47.770 --> 27:48.910]  If he ever gets healthy.
[27:49.850 --> 27:50.670]  He's got a back problem.
[27:50.810 --> 27:51.330]  Average 30.
[27:51.490 --> 27:52.590]  Marvin Bagley.
[27:53.890 --> 27:55.690]  Malik Monk, I have no opinion on.
[27:56.390 --> 27:57.590]  Zubats, I have no opinion on.
[27:57.690 --> 27:58.630]  Jett Howard rookie.
[27:59.150 --> 28:01.330]  That is Jalen Howard's son, right?
[28:01.750 --> 28:02.170]  Jett Howard?
[28:02.610 --> 28:04.530]  Like he went 14th in the draft, I wanna say?
[28:04.610 --> 28:05.290]  Who's Jalen Howard?
[28:05.750 --> 28:06.930]  He was an NBA player.
[28:07.930 --> 28:08.750]  Or Juwan Howard, I'm sorry.
[28:08.790 --> 28:09.790]  Not Jalen Howard, Juwan Howard.
[28:09.790 --> 28:11.950]  He played, I think he was in the Fab Five.
[28:12.350 --> 28:13.210]  Played for Michigan State.
[28:13.310 --> 28:17.270]  Well, LeBron sent Bronny when he goes into the NBA.
[28:17.810 --> 28:19.610]  Will they be the first father and son at the same time?
[28:20.110 --> 28:20.310]  Yeah.
[28:20.610 --> 28:21.090]  Oh, that's cool.
[28:21.110 --> 28:21.510]  In the NBA.
[28:22.210 --> 28:23.150]  It's happened in baseball.
[28:23.270 --> 28:23.510]  Okay.
[28:23.650 --> 28:24.390]  But not in the NBA.
[28:24.610 --> 28:24.930]  That's cool.
[28:25.530 --> 28:28.270]  Dwayne Wade, this like hoops retro card.
[28:28.890 --> 28:30.230]  I don't know why, interesting though.
[28:30.870 --> 28:33.430]  Oh, and then here's a Nick Smith Jr. now playing.
[28:33.690 --> 28:34.750]  That's their rookie insert.
[28:35.950 --> 28:36.370]  That's cute.
[28:36.510 --> 28:37.070]  Keep going.
[28:37.390 --> 28:38.670]  I'm stupid, are any of these good?
[28:38.670 --> 28:40.090]  Nah, not so far.
[28:40.470 --> 28:42.610]  Maybe that's Steph Curry, but...
[28:42.610 --> 28:42.890]  Duh!
[28:43.130 --> 28:44.370]  Hoops is a low-end product.
[28:44.550 --> 28:46.790]  It's the lowest end of like acceptable cards.
[28:47.030 --> 28:47.470]  No reds.
[28:47.530 --> 28:50.070]  So you're not gonna get a lot of value in it.
[28:50.090 --> 28:51.770]  We're really just looking for wimpy rookies.
[28:51.950 --> 28:53.470]  Drew Holiday or scoot rookies.
[28:53.570 --> 28:54.110]  Peyton Pritchard.
[28:55.490 --> 28:57.110]  Would he be considered a six man?
[28:58.070 --> 28:58.790]  He'd like to be.
[28:58.990 --> 29:00.570]  I think Al Horford's probably our six man.
[29:00.810 --> 29:01.250]  Oh, he's six.
[29:01.310 --> 29:02.050]  I thought he'd be starting.
[29:02.630 --> 29:04.810]  He decided to come off the bench for the good of the team.
[29:06.190 --> 29:08.130]  Mike Conley, still...
[29:08.130 --> 29:08.870]  Still kicking.
[29:09.010 --> 29:11.030]  Still somehow kicking and still good.
[29:11.170 --> 29:12.250]  It is 64.
[29:13.610 --> 29:14.570]  John Collins...
[29:14.990 --> 29:15.870]  I don't like John Collins.
[29:18.110 --> 29:19.170]  What is it, good?
[29:21.750 --> 29:22.710]  Boo-hoo.
[29:22.890 --> 29:23.430]  Oh boy.
[29:23.990 --> 29:24.890]  Boo-hoo.
[29:25.890 --> 29:28.230]  It's my first Marcus Smart Christmas card.
[29:28.950 --> 29:29.630]  Oh, it hurts.
[29:30.190 --> 29:31.170]  It hurts so bad.
[29:31.330 --> 29:32.310]  It's a good card.
[29:32.370 --> 29:32.870]  That was pathetic.
[29:32.890 --> 29:33.790]  But you guys got Drew Holiday.
[29:34.350 --> 29:34.790]  I do.
[29:34.930 --> 29:35.630]  I love Drew Holiday.
[29:35.950 --> 29:36.670]  I love the trade.
[29:36.670 --> 29:38.150]  I understand the trade.
[29:38.270 --> 29:39.250]  That's the hardest part about it.
[29:39.290 --> 29:40.810]  It makes absolute sense.
[29:40.890 --> 29:42.610]  And if I were Brad, I would have made the trade too.
[29:42.890 --> 29:43.710]  But it still hurts.
[29:45.310 --> 29:52.970]  I like Marcus Smart so much, Sammy, that I have at this point more than 4,000 individual unique Marcus Smart cards.
[29:53.170 --> 29:53.770]  Not duplicates.
[29:53.810 --> 29:54.830]  4,000?
[29:54.930 --> 29:57.150]  4,000 different Marcus Smart cards.
[29:57.310 --> 29:58.050]  Now I have 4,001.
[29:58.270 --> 29:59.570]  I wrote him a...
[29:59.570 --> 30:00.710]  You wrote him a letter?
[30:00.710 --> 30:08.990]  So one of the things that people do when they have extra wedding invites is you can send them to different companies or different celebrities and stuff.
[30:09.070 --> 30:11.670]  So I did a bunch and then I was like, I'm going to send one to Marcus Smart.
[30:11.990 --> 30:18.010]  But he's the only one that I included a letter that was like, dear Marcus Smart, my fiancé Geoff is such a big fan.
[30:18.090 --> 30:19.610]  He has all of your cards.
[30:19.930 --> 30:20.410]  He eats your cereal.
[30:20.450 --> 30:25.270]  We're so sad that you left the Celtics, but we're just so happy to see you on another team.
[30:25.410 --> 30:25.650]  Bye!
[30:27.310 --> 30:28.650]  I haven't heard back yet.
[30:28.710 --> 30:29.250]  Hey, shut up.
[30:29.250 --> 30:30.750]  Yeah, and then he showed up.
[30:30.850 --> 30:31.250]  It was really cool.
[30:31.330 --> 30:33.570]  He brought the Celtics cake that we had as Geoff's groom's cake.
[30:33.610 --> 30:34.150]  And it was amazing.
[30:34.230 --> 30:35.270]  He brought Jason Tatum.
[30:35.650 --> 30:36.050]  Yeah!
[30:36.290 --> 30:37.090]  This is...
[30:37.090 --> 30:38.670]  This is... I'm a little excited about.
[30:39.030 --> 30:42.430]  Not because it's Cason Wallace, but there's a new insert in 2024.
[30:42.990 --> 30:43.650]  23, 24.
[30:43.790 --> 30:44.130]  Sheesh.
[30:44.390 --> 30:46.430]  We gotta save those for Lily.
[30:46.630 --> 30:48.430]  We'll have a Riz card next.
[30:48.610 --> 30:48.790]  Sheesh!
[30:48.790 --> 30:52.550]  If we get Wimby in that, we'll have some money, I think.
[30:52.770 --> 30:52.950]  Oh.
[30:54.310 --> 30:55.070]  What is it?
[30:58.320 --> 30:59.460]  Kelly Oubre Jr.
[30:59.460 --> 31:01.580]  The NBA's Mr. Steal Your Girl.
[31:02.160 --> 31:02.700]  Uh, Tyrese Maxey.
[31:02.700 --> 31:03.480]  What is Jersey?
[31:04.260 --> 31:04.960]  It says...
[31:04.960 --> 31:05.160]  Clit?
[31:05.160 --> 31:05.880]  It says clit, yeah.
[31:05.920 --> 31:06.580]  Yeah, Charlotte.
[31:06.580 --> 31:07.520]  Charlotte Hornets.
[31:07.760 --> 31:08.640]  The Clarlet Hornets.
[31:08.840 --> 31:09.740]  The Clit...
[31:10.420 --> 31:11.220]  The Clit Hornets.
[31:11.280 --> 31:14.600]  Tyrese Maxey, probably gonna win Most Improved Player of the Year.
[31:14.820 --> 31:15.000]  For sure.
[31:15.100 --> 31:15.980]  And deserves it.
[31:16.040 --> 31:17.800]  Unless it's not Shay again.
[31:17.900 --> 31:18.480]  Shay, yeah.
[31:18.640 --> 31:20.560]  He improved to 30 points.
[31:21.040 --> 31:23.140]  Talk about addition by subtraction.
[31:23.400 --> 31:26.320]  Getting rid of James Harden has freed Tyrese Maxey up to be a superstar.
[31:26.520 --> 31:27.700]  And he is...
[31:27.700 --> 31:28.240]  Killin' it.
[31:28.240 --> 31:29.280]  He is killin' it.
[31:29.420 --> 31:29.980]  And more power to him.
[31:30.040 --> 31:31.420]  I can't stand the 76ers.
[31:31.620 --> 31:32.320]  Better than the Celtics.
[31:33.160 --> 31:34.520]  I really like Tyrese Maxey.
[31:34.600 --> 31:35.380]  You mean the...
[31:35.380 --> 31:35.760]  What is it?
[31:35.780 --> 31:37.180]  13-4 best striker in the NBA?
[31:37.460 --> 31:38.580]  First in the East?
[31:39.180 --> 31:39.940]  Jordan Poole.
[31:42.540 --> 31:43.880]  Washington Wizards' Jordan Poole.
[31:44.180 --> 31:47.140]  He decided he wanted to look like a dad from the 70s.
[31:47.220 --> 31:47.580]  Hell yeah.
[31:47.620 --> 31:48.920]  He's got the hair and the mustache.
[31:49.200 --> 31:50.040]  And he's just rockin' it.
[31:50.080 --> 31:51.060]  Is he wearing short shorts yet?
[31:51.520 --> 31:51.920]  No.
[31:52.300 --> 31:52.880]  He's too...
[31:52.880 --> 31:54.660]  He's too into himself to wear short shorts.
[31:54.800 --> 31:56.420]  Show me them booties and them balls.
[31:57.100 --> 31:59.440]  I think he'll probably get dealt.
[31:59.840 --> 32:00.920]  I don't think they're gonna keep him.
[32:01.260 --> 32:04.840]  Jordan Poole and Kyle Kuzma might be the best duo in the NBA.
[32:05.200 --> 32:08.540]  Because they are the most entertaining to watch.
[32:08.760 --> 32:09.340]  They are.
[32:09.500 --> 32:11.320]  They will do the stupidest stuff in a game.
[32:12.300 --> 32:13.380]  And they don't care.
[32:13.640 --> 32:14.800]  They're the worst team in the league.
[32:14.900 --> 32:15.340]  Who cares?
[32:15.540 --> 32:16.180]  Who gives a shit, right?
[32:16.220 --> 32:16.940]  Who cares?
[32:17.460 --> 32:18.760]  We live in a watching kid.
[32:19.040 --> 32:20.500]  It's like directing a...
[32:20.500 --> 32:22.880]  It's like being the director on a made-for-TV movie.
[32:23.020 --> 32:23.540]  It's like, yeah, whatever.
[32:23.620 --> 32:24.120]  I don't give a fuck.
[32:24.480 --> 32:25.220]  Nobody's gonna watch this.
[32:25.220 --> 32:25.720]  Nobody cares.
[32:25.820 --> 32:29.820]  They'll do off-the-backboard Harlem Globetrotter moves.
[32:29.960 --> 32:31.180]  They're down 70 points.
[32:31.620 --> 32:32.840]  They're playing rec league ball.
[32:32.960 --> 32:33.420]  That's fun.
[32:33.560 --> 32:36.640]  Triple J, Jaren Jackson Jr. I used to like until this season.
[32:36.760 --> 32:39.740]  He's really quitting on the team on the court, unfortunately.
[32:40.020 --> 32:41.260]  And he quit on the USA team.
[32:41.420 --> 32:41.980]  He did.
[32:42.240 --> 32:43.920]  Do you think he's mad that Marcus Smart's there?
[32:44.040 --> 32:46.660]  No, I think everybody on that team is happy that Marcus Smart's there.
[32:46.760 --> 32:47.260]  And they should be.
[32:47.560 --> 32:50.520]  But they're down seven players right now.
[32:50.660 --> 32:51.460]  When does Ja come back?
[32:51.460 --> 32:52.120]  What time of year?
[32:52.440 --> 32:53.680]  He comes back in ten games.
[32:53.880 --> 32:54.640]  Oh, that's not bad.
[32:54.640 --> 32:55.240]  Eleven games.
[32:55.360 --> 32:56.120]  He'll be back soon.
[32:56.340 --> 32:57.780]  Has he been able to work out with them?
[32:57.860 --> 32:58.460]  Or he just can't play?
[32:58.540 --> 32:59.200]  He's worked out with them.
[32:59.300 --> 32:59.700]  He can't.
[32:59.820 --> 33:00.240]  He won't play.
[33:00.300 --> 33:00.840]  It won't matter.
[33:01.000 --> 33:01.720]  They're so bad.
[33:01.840 --> 33:02.780]  And the record is so bad.
[33:03.060 --> 33:06.400]  And they have so many other talented people injured that their season's pretty much over.
[33:06.760 --> 33:07.200]  It's a bummer.
[33:07.260 --> 33:09.420]  Do you think he'll go on Instagram Live again with a gun?
[33:10.600 --> 33:12.600]  It was a third time's a charm, right?
[33:12.700 --> 33:13.520]  It was a lighter.
[33:14.640 --> 33:15.840]  It was a lighter.
[33:16.460 --> 33:17.080]  Come on, guys.
[33:17.100 --> 33:19.180]  Baby Brown for the Clippers.
[33:20.880 --> 33:21.600]  Gabe Vincent.
[33:21.980 --> 33:22.460]  I have...
[33:22.460 --> 33:23.260]  I like Gabe Vincent.
[33:23.260 --> 33:24.380]  I'm happy he left the Heat.
[33:25.320 --> 33:28.660]  I thought he would provide more of an impact on the Lakers, though.
[33:29.080 --> 33:29.400]  Hasn't yet.
[33:29.480 --> 33:29.940]  Oh, cool.
[33:30.120 --> 33:30.640]  Eamon Thompson.
[33:30.840 --> 33:31.240]  There you go.
[33:31.340 --> 33:32.240]  We're the Thompson twins, though.
[33:32.240 --> 33:32.800]  He's on the cover.
[33:33.000 --> 33:34.340]  He's playing really well so far this year.
[33:35.260 --> 33:36.660]  He's a base rookie, so it's not worth anything.
[33:36.940 --> 33:38.440]  Oh, City Edition.
[33:39.460 --> 33:40.180]  Tyrese Halliburton.
[33:41.160 --> 33:42.260]  Best point guard in the league.
[33:42.560 --> 33:43.060]  You think so?
[33:43.120 --> 33:43.600]  Better than SGA?
[33:44.180 --> 33:46.460]  I mean, he's the purest point guard in the league.
[33:46.640 --> 33:49.860]  He doesn't score like SGA, but he gets about 16 assists a game.
[33:50.660 --> 33:57.160]  I'd say Shay might be more of a shooting guard, but he does facilitate the offense.
[33:57.180 --> 33:57.720]  He facilitates.
[33:57.780 --> 33:58.060]  But you're right.
[33:58.180 --> 34:02.000]  He definitely is a score-first kind of guard.
[34:02.960 --> 34:03.160]  Fuck it.
[34:03.180 --> 34:04.100]  Let's just keep going with these, right?
[34:04.180 --> 34:06.280]  Does anybody refer to themselves as the facility?
[34:06.860 --> 34:07.480]  The facility?
[34:07.600 --> 34:12.980]  It's like the program or the process, but then he's the facilitator, so he's the facility.
[34:13.200 --> 34:14.560]  Probably James Harden, probably.
[34:14.700 --> 34:15.300]  He's the system.
[34:15.400 --> 34:16.100]  He's like, I'm everything.
[34:16.300 --> 34:16.500]  Yeah.
[34:17.080 --> 34:17.480]  Boban.
[34:17.840 --> 34:18.800]  That's your favorite player.
[34:18.800 --> 34:20.400]  He's the guy that scares you.
[34:20.600 --> 34:21.460]  He upsets me.
[34:21.560 --> 34:25.500]  He looks like the guy from that movie Big Fish, and then he has that commercial with the goldfish.
[34:25.740 --> 34:26.720]  Have you seen John Wick?
[34:27.300 --> 34:27.580]  No.
[34:28.080 --> 34:28.840]  He's in John Wick.
[34:28.960 --> 34:29.540]  He is, that's right.
[34:29.720 --> 34:30.320]  He is in John Wick, yeah.
[34:30.340 --> 34:30.880]  The first one?
[34:31.100 --> 34:32.100]  There's like eight of them, right?
[34:32.180 --> 34:32.760]  There's four.
[34:33.140 --> 34:35.500]  He might have been either in the second or third movie.
[34:35.800 --> 34:36.480]  Scotty Barnes?
[34:36.500 --> 34:39.400]  I thought there was a dog involved, and I didn't want to see it.
[34:41.300 --> 34:44.480]  Real lackluster second season of Scotty Barnes, but he's off to a great start this season.
[34:44.660 --> 34:45.620]  I got hopes for him.
[34:45.640 --> 34:46.680]  Even with it being lackluster?
[34:47.280 --> 34:48.920]  Even with last season being lackluster.
[34:49.040 --> 34:49.800]  But this season he's doing well.
[34:49.860 --> 34:51.880]  Dyson Daniels, named after a vacuum cleaner.
[34:51.940 --> 34:53.400]  There's got to be a better photo of him.
[34:53.560 --> 34:54.240]  Of Dyson Daniels?
[34:54.520 --> 34:55.260]  Should we make that?
[34:55.760 --> 34:57.100]  There's got to be a better photo of him.
[34:57.120 --> 34:57.680]  He's like, that's the best you had.
[34:57.720 --> 34:58.620]  He's a handsome boy.
[34:58.940 --> 34:59.060]  Yeah.
[34:59.780 --> 35:00.500]  Rashawn Holmes.
[35:01.240 --> 35:03.560]  Jalen Suggs, or Suggy, as I call him.
[35:03.660 --> 35:04.180]  Nobody else does.
[35:05.160 --> 35:07.340]  Max Christie, promising young player for the Lakers.
[35:08.780 --> 35:09.500]  Tumani Kamara.
[35:09.920 --> 35:10.480]  That's nice.
[35:10.780 --> 35:11.940]  And then a...
[35:12.360 --> 35:12.720]  Sheesh!
[35:13.060 --> 35:13.420]  Sheesh!
[35:13.580 --> 35:14.560]  Another Thompson brother.
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.200]  There's got to be a better photo of him, too.
[35:17.340 --> 35:18.080]  Jesus Christ.
[35:18.080 --> 35:19.180]  But is he a handsome man?
[35:19.560 --> 35:20.000]  Let's see.
[35:20.060 --> 35:20.720]  Is he a handsome boy?
[35:20.860 --> 35:21.920]  Yeah, they're very handsome.
[35:22.800 --> 35:23.920]  I'm trying to think of who...
[35:23.920 --> 35:26.000]  Yeah, that's action shot right there.
[35:26.040 --> 35:26.440]  That's terrible.
[35:26.500 --> 35:27.300]  He looks like a ghoul.
[35:27.420 --> 35:28.400]  He does look a little ghoulish.
[35:28.880 --> 35:30.580]  They look like the actor who...
[35:30.580 --> 35:30.920]  I can't remember.
[35:31.000 --> 35:32.500]  I don't know who he was, but he was in Ghost.
[35:32.640 --> 35:33.820]  Like he was like the bad guy.
[35:34.240 --> 35:37.080]  No, it's like that movie Ghost with Patrick Swayze.
[35:38.020 --> 35:38.500]  Oh, Patrick Swayze.
[35:38.620 --> 35:39.460]  Like the bad guy.
[35:39.460 --> 35:41.200]  The bad guy that kills him or something.
[35:42.020 --> 35:42.820]  Oh, Boban.
[35:43.020 --> 35:43.960]  Yeah, Boban, right?
[35:43.960 --> 35:44.700]  With the goldfish.
[35:44.900 --> 35:45.860]  Yeah, he was in...
[35:45.860 --> 35:48.380]  I think he was in Ghost 2.
[35:49.100 --> 35:49.960]  Paul George.
[35:50.740 --> 35:52.280]  Fred Van Vliet, speaking of.
[35:52.420 --> 35:54.060]  Only player in the history of the NBA
[35:54.060 --> 35:56.660]  to get a max contract to be undrafted.
[35:56.760 --> 35:58.020]  Only undrafted player ever to get a max contract.
[35:58.700 --> 35:59.500]  Big Cat.
[35:59.680 --> 36:00.440]  Karl-Anthony Towns.
[36:00.460 --> 36:02.600]  I feel like the NBA is losing their patience on him.
[36:03.120 --> 36:04.160]  Jordan Clarkson.
[36:04.380 --> 36:05.100]  I've never liked.
[36:05.480 --> 36:06.660]  Robert Covington.
[36:07.760 --> 36:08.700]  Oh, shit.
[36:08.800 --> 36:09.680]  Shaquille O'Neal.
[36:09.960 --> 36:10.660]  Hoops legend.
[36:10.860 --> 36:11.460]  Hey-oh.
[36:11.600 --> 36:11.940]  Look at that.
[36:12.600 --> 36:13.040]  Sheesh.
[36:13.040 --> 36:14.320]  His bald ass.
[36:14.920 --> 36:15.740]  Oster Thompson.
[36:15.920 --> 36:17.080]  Did you see when he had to...
[36:17.080 --> 36:19.620]  when he lost that bet and he had to grow his hairline out?
[36:20.020 --> 36:21.200]  Oh, my God, dude.
[36:21.660 --> 36:22.540]  John Collins again.
[36:22.980 --> 36:24.580]  That was so fucking funny.
[36:24.780 --> 36:26.440]  Shaq is the funniest...
[36:26.440 --> 36:28.200]  inside the NBA on TNT.
[36:28.880 --> 36:31.700]  Funniest show that basketball has ever put out.
[36:31.700 --> 36:32.600]  Funniest show on TV.
[36:32.780 --> 36:33.500]  For sure.
[36:33.720 --> 36:35.060]  Funniest show on TV.
[36:35.220 --> 36:35.660]  For sure.
[36:36.060 --> 36:38.940]  It used to be first take with Skip and Shannon Sharp.
[36:39.540 --> 36:40.760]  Then Shannon left.
[36:40.880 --> 36:41.080]  Yeah.
[36:41.920 --> 36:46.620]  And now they're interviewing Facebook comedians on the Skip Bayless show.
[36:47.320 --> 36:49.260]  Sammy and I have all the same opinions on stuff.
[36:49.360 --> 36:49.940]  I like this.
[36:50.780 --> 36:51.120]  Here we go.
[36:51.200 --> 36:52.420]  We got a John Collins red back.
[36:52.540 --> 36:53.140]  I'm gonna show this.
[36:53.720 --> 36:55.700]  Card's the same other than the back is red.
[36:55.800 --> 36:58.400]  I think it's about four times as rare as a black back.
[36:58.500 --> 37:00.380]  This is the only red back we've gotten so far out of this box.
[37:00.460 --> 37:00.920]  So that's good.
[37:01.360 --> 37:01.440]  Yeah.
[37:02.080 --> 37:02.740]  So that's cool.
[37:03.360 --> 37:04.480]  That's a little bit of...
[37:04.960 --> 37:05.700]  a little bit of something.
[37:07.820 --> 37:08.180]  Okay.
[37:09.340 --> 37:10.020]  Dorian Finney-Smith.
[37:10.020 --> 37:11.920]  By the way, I paid $200 for this box.
[37:12.160 --> 37:14.520]  Do you think we've gotten $200 worth of stuff out of there?
[37:14.920 --> 37:16.400]  No, we've gotten $30.
[37:16.540 --> 37:17.580]  Gotta be the John Collins.
[37:17.980 --> 37:19.000]  Dorian Finney-Smith.
[37:19.160 --> 37:20.400]  Wendell Moore Jr.
[37:20.720 --> 37:21.560]  De'Aaron Fox.
[37:22.660 --> 37:25.040]  Confused about what's going on with the Kings this year so far.
[37:25.180 --> 37:31.180]  They are severely underperforming for a team that I thought was gonna have a much stronger season.
[37:31.820 --> 37:32.780]  Norman Powell.
[37:34.700 --> 37:38.160]  Draymond Green currently serving a suspension for being Draymond Green.
[37:39.080 --> 37:39.960]  Derek Lively.
[37:40.460 --> 37:40.840]  Let's go.
[37:41.720 --> 37:42.440]  Oh, here we go.
[37:42.560 --> 37:43.540]  A little Hoops Luka.
[37:43.980 --> 37:45.020]  That's a much better pick of him.
[37:45.240 --> 37:45.820]  Is that a Jokic?
[37:46.000 --> 37:46.320]  Yeah.
[37:46.440 --> 37:48.320]  And then a Joker road to the finals.
[37:48.700 --> 37:50.320]  Numbered 129 of 499.
[37:50.980 --> 37:51.540]  That's nice.
[37:51.700 --> 37:52.700]  Second best center in the league.
[37:56.540 --> 37:57.660]  First is Embiid.
[37:58.380 --> 37:58.800]  First is Embiid.
[37:58.800 --> 37:58.980]  First is Embiid.
[38:01.060 --> 38:01.900]  Listen, dude.
[38:02.300 --> 38:05.200]  Who's taking Embiid over Joker in a draft?
[38:05.460 --> 38:06.640]  I used to have a case.
[38:07.660 --> 38:10.540]  And then Jokic put up every advance stat.
[38:11.180 --> 38:12.500]  He's beating Wilt numbers.
[38:12.700 --> 38:13.280]  It's like, fuck.
[38:13.320 --> 38:13.780]  It's ridiculous.
[38:14.200 --> 38:16.080]  I can't support the flop merchant anymore.
[38:16.360 --> 38:17.580]  It's like a cartoon what he's doing.
[38:17.720 --> 38:18.320]  Zach Levine.
[38:18.440 --> 38:20.900]  He will not be a bull by the end of the year.
[38:21.120 --> 38:21.800]  He's gonna be a Laker.
[38:22.180 --> 38:22.900]  He might be.
[38:23.660 --> 38:25.360]  There's a really good chance he'll be a Laker.
[38:25.460 --> 38:26.400]  Sign the clutch sports.
[38:27.700 --> 38:28.960]  De'Anthony Melton.
[38:30.920 --> 38:31.720]  Victor Oladipo.
[38:32.080 --> 38:33.200]  Is he... I guess he plays for...
[38:33.200 --> 38:33.700]  Okay, is he now?
[38:33.800 --> 38:34.700]  I don't know if he's still...
[38:34.700 --> 38:36.200]  He turned his knee...
[38:36.200 --> 38:38.800]  That dude hurt his knee so bad five years ago,
[38:38.920 --> 38:40.020]  it like spun around.
[38:40.460 --> 38:40.540]  Ew.
[38:40.720 --> 38:42.220]  Yeah, he's never really been the same since.
[38:42.340 --> 38:43.020]  Would you...
[38:43.020 --> 38:44.180]  What is...
[38:44.180 --> 38:44.660]  There was...
[38:44.660 --> 38:46.160]  Who was the guy that broke his ankle really bad?
[38:46.420 --> 38:46.800]  Celtic.
[38:47.280 --> 38:47.860]  Oh, Gordon Hayward?
[38:48.140 --> 38:48.880]  Would you say that was...
[38:48.880 --> 38:50.180]  That was on TV, too.
[38:50.180 --> 38:50.380]  Yeah.
[38:50.460 --> 38:50.880]  I've been watching it.
[38:50.920 --> 38:53.700]  Would you say that was the most brutal live, like...
[38:54.420 --> 38:54.680]  Injury...
[38:54.680 --> 38:55.380]  Injury...
[38:55.380 --> 38:57.380]  I've ever seen, yes.
[38:57.520 --> 38:57.740]  Right.
[38:58.000 --> 38:59.560]  But I've seen a lot of football injuries that are...
[38:59.560 --> 39:00.400]  No, no, no, I'm saying basketball.
[39:00.600 --> 39:02.140]  I mean, we watched the Michigan game.
[39:02.280 --> 39:02.320]  It was disgusting.
[39:02.320 --> 39:04.500]  I saw the Paul George injury.
[39:04.920 --> 39:05.380]  What'd he do?
[39:05.620 --> 39:06.420]  He did the same thing.
[39:06.420 --> 39:06.840]  Snatched his leg, right?
[39:07.000 --> 39:08.180]  He did it a year before.
[39:08.980 --> 39:10.520]  Yeah, he did it in a...
[39:10.520 --> 39:12.500]  Like a Team USA game in Vegas, yeah.
[39:12.560 --> 39:12.940]  Oh, shit.
[39:12.940 --> 39:16.420]  But the Gordon Hayward injury, they showed it on camera,
[39:16.700 --> 39:19.340]  and we got the picture of Dwyane Wade doing this...
[39:19.940 --> 39:20.160]  Yeah.
[39:20.440 --> 39:20.980]  ...on screen.
[39:21.100 --> 39:23.760]  And I was also watching that game, and...
[39:23.760 --> 39:25.840]  Because I was like, yes, Dwyane Wade, this is our year.
[39:26.120 --> 39:27.100]  This is the Cavs' year.
[39:28.760 --> 39:31.580]  Oh, that was heartbreaking.
[39:31.580 --> 39:32.460]  Isaac Okoro.
[39:32.760 --> 39:33.260]  Okoro.
[39:33.900 --> 39:34.800]  Caleb Martin.
[39:35.920 --> 39:37.540]  Nick Smith Jr.
[39:37.780 --> 39:38.620]  We'll see that.
[39:38.840 --> 39:39.280]  Base rookie.
[39:39.800 --> 39:43.420]  Jonathan Kuminga, I keep waiting for him to hit the next level.
[39:44.700 --> 39:46.560]  Anthony Black now playing.
[39:46.760 --> 39:47.480]  We'll see that.
[39:47.820 --> 39:49.200]  About halfway through this box.
[39:49.400 --> 39:50.340]  They call him the cum bucket.
[39:51.320 --> 39:51.680]  The...
[39:51.680 --> 39:52.040]  Kuminga?
[39:52.260 --> 39:52.380]  Yeah.
[39:52.380 --> 39:52.660]  Really, really?
[39:52.740 --> 39:53.500]  The cum bucket, yeah.
[39:53.740 --> 39:54.420]  Why is that?
[39:54.880 --> 39:55.860]  I don't know.
[39:56.480 --> 40:01.000]  The Bulls had Lonzo Ball, Zach Levine, and DeMar DeRozan.
[40:01.000 --> 40:02.280]  They were called DeBalzac.
[40:02.600 --> 40:03.240]  That's true.
[40:03.920 --> 40:05.340]  DeBalzac, we got the cum bucket.
[40:05.560 --> 40:07.020]  Oh, I love it.
[40:07.660 --> 40:08.420]  I like this.
[40:08.920 --> 40:09.880]  Sammy, you gotta come on more often.
[40:10.300 --> 40:11.580]  What do you do on Monday afternoons?
[40:11.840 --> 40:12.320]  I gulp.
[40:13.760 --> 40:14.820]  I gulp every day.
[40:16.280 --> 40:18.160]  Christian Brown, however you say it.
[40:18.280 --> 40:19.960]  Shay Don Sharp, who's very good.
[40:20.820 --> 40:23.060]  Jabari Smith Jr., who's very good.
[40:24.000 --> 40:25.340]  Bogdan Bogdanovich, I don't give a shit about.
[40:25.380 --> 40:26.500]  He looks like Chris Damaris a little bit.
[40:26.760 --> 40:28.100]  That's all I can think of any time I see him.
[40:28.220 --> 40:29.340]  He looks kind of like Chris Damaris.
[40:29.400 --> 40:30.120]  He's good, though.
[40:30.120 --> 40:30.760]  He is good.
[40:31.120 --> 40:33.160]  Unlike Chris Damaris, who I don't think is any good at basketball.
[40:33.380 --> 40:35.300]  Trey Murphy III is great.
[40:36.540 --> 40:37.260]  James Nagy.
[40:37.700 --> 40:38.880]  I wonder if he's related to Zeke Nagy.
[40:39.580 --> 40:40.940]  I assume he probably is.
[40:41.980 --> 40:43.940]  Devin Vassell, pretty solid player.
[40:44.680 --> 40:45.480]  And then, oh, here we go.
[40:45.560 --> 40:48.180]  Keontae George, anti-gravity insert.
[40:48.260 --> 40:48.860]  That's cool.
[40:48.960 --> 40:49.960]  I haven't seen any of these inserts.
[40:50.100 --> 40:50.620]  They're all new to me.
[40:51.540 --> 40:52.340]  I'm gonna have to open faster.
[40:52.580 --> 40:54.120]  Which one do you think is, like...
[40:55.620 --> 40:56.680]  This one has a hit.
[40:57.040 --> 40:57.420]  That one does.
[40:58.340 --> 40:59.060]  I'm gonna...
[40:59.060 --> 40:59.600]  This one is.
[40:59.760 --> 41:00.500]  Pac-Sac, this one.
[41:00.500 --> 41:01.640]  That's got women-yama right there.
[41:01.660 --> 41:02.280]  This has got that women.
[41:02.980 --> 41:04.100]  Yeah, we need to feed the Pac-Sac.
[41:04.200 --> 41:05.260]  All right, we're gonna get through this.
[41:05.380 --> 41:07.700]  I was gonna try to open all these today, and we have...
[41:07.700 --> 41:10.900]  Well, now I've gotten a lot of input, so now I'm just gonna let you just, like, rip it.
[41:11.180 --> 41:12.620]  All right, Josh Hart.
[41:13.800 --> 41:14.160]  Vucevic.
[41:14.540 --> 41:18.040]  Boy, that dude's an NBA player from a previous era.
[41:18.160 --> 41:19.160]  Who's Gilly the Kid?
[41:19.540 --> 41:19.960]  Who's who?
[41:20.320 --> 41:21.740]  Sammy is sounding like Gilly the Kid.
[41:22.060 --> 41:22.460]  Who's Gilly?
[41:22.460 --> 41:23.140]  Gilly the Kid.
[41:24.300 --> 41:24.820]  I don't know.
[41:25.580 --> 41:26.160]  Thank you.
[41:26.300 --> 41:27.200]  Or, fuck you.
[41:27.320 --> 41:28.620]  No, I take it as a compliment.
[41:28.620 --> 41:29.220]  Thank you.
[41:29.240 --> 41:30.000]  Huge compliment.
[41:30.040 --> 41:30.460]  Thank you.
[41:30.540 --> 41:30.700]  Hell yeah.
[41:31.200 --> 41:32.040]  Mo Bamba.
[41:32.520 --> 41:34.140]  Do you think it's the way you said cum bucket?
[41:34.420 --> 41:35.680]  That he was like, that's Gilly.
[41:35.800 --> 41:36.600]  Or DeBalza.
[41:36.680 --> 41:38.260]  Yeah, he was like, I hear Gilly.
[41:38.560 --> 41:39.500]  Gilly's his kid.
[41:39.640 --> 41:39.820]  Yeah.
[41:40.160 --> 41:41.500]  Sounds like Gilly, my kid.
[41:41.800 --> 41:46.500]  Mo Bamba might be the only NBA player who's got a better song than he is a player.
[41:46.820 --> 41:47.260]  Damn.
[41:47.600 --> 41:48.560]  Aaron Wiggins.
[41:48.620 --> 41:48.680]  Shut up.
[41:48.760 --> 41:49.300]  It's true.
[41:49.380 --> 41:50.780]  That Mo Bamba song was a fucking banger.
[41:51.440 --> 41:52.280]  Karis LeVert.
[41:52.940 --> 41:54.000]  I like Karis LeVert.
[41:54.680 --> 41:55.720]  Scoot Henderson rookie.
[41:55.980 --> 41:56.260]  There we go.
[41:56.260 --> 41:56.600]  Scoot's good.
[41:56.600 --> 41:57.200]  Nice.
[41:57.760 --> 41:58.400]  Sleeve that.
[41:58.920 --> 42:00.560]  Got ourselves a KG.
[42:01.600 --> 42:02.240]  Timberwolves, but...
[42:02.240 --> 42:02.860]  Kevin Garnett?
[42:03.220 --> 42:04.060]  Yeah, Kevin Garnett.
[42:04.160 --> 42:04.760]  Yeah, he's back.
[42:04.900 --> 42:05.460]  And then Terry...
[42:06.600 --> 42:09.080]  He's the Udonis Haslam of the Timberwolves.
[42:09.200 --> 42:10.940]  He's doing all those sports betting commercials.
[42:11.300 --> 42:11.620]  Nope.
[42:11.740 --> 42:12.160]  Terry Rozier.
[42:12.280 --> 42:13.180]  You're just talking about how great he is.
[42:13.200 --> 42:13.900]  Terry Rozier numbered to 199.
[42:14.420 --> 42:14.880]  That's nice.
[42:14.900 --> 42:15.780]  It's like holographic.
[42:15.800 --> 42:16.700]  But look, it had a...
[42:16.700 --> 42:19.900]  I didn't get the Wemby, but I felt like it had a numbered card.
[42:19.900 --> 42:20.660]  Yeah, and you nailed it.
[42:20.940 --> 42:21.520]  And we're not done.
[42:21.600 --> 42:23.180]  We still have to open up all these.
[42:23.540 --> 42:24.220]  We're getting Wemby.
[42:24.520 --> 42:24.980]  We're gonna get it.
[42:24.980 --> 42:25.540]  I'm gonna go faster.
[42:25.540 --> 42:25.820]  I'm gonna go faster.
[42:25.820 --> 42:26.740]  What's the next...
[42:26.740 --> 42:27.140]  Okay, yeah.
[42:27.220 --> 42:27.340]  Okay.
[42:27.660 --> 42:28.740]  Derek White, Celtic.
[42:28.900 --> 42:29.100]  Boom.
[42:29.600 --> 42:29.880]  Buffalo.
[42:30.380 --> 42:31.240]  Cam Johnson.
[42:33.020 --> 42:33.740]  Kenyon Martin.
[42:34.480 --> 42:34.920]  I...
[42:36.400 --> 42:37.280]  Think he...
[42:37.280 --> 42:37.700]  Is...
[42:37.700 --> 42:38.240]  Did he get...
[42:38.240 --> 42:40.480]  Dumped from Houston because of his problems, right?
[42:40.600 --> 42:41.400]  He's also problematic.
[42:41.680 --> 42:42.140]  I think.
[42:42.880 --> 42:43.380]  There's some...
[42:43.380 --> 42:43.820]  I don't remember.
[42:43.960 --> 42:45.380]  Assault issues with him, I believe?
[42:46.700 --> 42:47.140]  Maybe.
[42:47.440 --> 42:48.180]  I can be wrong about that.
[42:48.380 --> 42:48.820]  Allegedly.
[42:48.880 --> 42:49.280]  Allegedly.
[42:49.620 --> 42:50.380]  Davion Mitchell.
[42:51.160 --> 42:51.580]  Pretty good.
[42:51.720 --> 42:52.580]  Defensive monster.
[42:52.660 --> 42:52.960]  Pretty good.
[42:53.060 --> 42:54.080]  Bojan Bogdanovic.
[42:54.080 --> 42:55.700]  He's a...
[42:55.700 --> 42:55.880]  Is that his brother?
[42:56.400 --> 42:56.880]  No.
[42:57.360 --> 42:58.480]  He's really good, though.
[42:58.560 --> 42:59.500]  And they're just...
[42:59.500 --> 43:00.760]  He's just wasted on the Pistons.
[43:00.800 --> 43:05.800]  He could be a really awesome bench player for a contending team.
[43:06.040 --> 43:06.320]  Okay.
[43:06.620 --> 43:07.200]  Well, that's cool.
[43:07.520 --> 43:08.100]  We'll do this one.
[43:08.160 --> 43:08.940]  Keldon Johnson.
[43:09.520 --> 43:12.440]  We got ourselves a Pascal Siakam City Edition.
[43:12.680 --> 43:14.120]  And then this last card's pretty cool.
[43:14.480 --> 43:15.580]  Victor Wembenyama.
[43:16.180 --> 43:17.040]  Base rookie.
[43:17.380 --> 43:17.800]  Ay!
[43:17.860 --> 43:18.640]  So we got a Wemby.
[43:19.140 --> 43:19.500]  Ay!
[43:20.160 --> 43:22.120]  Look how bored this kid is.
[43:22.380 --> 43:23.360]  I don't think I'm gonna see him.
[43:23.360 --> 43:23.940]  Keldon Johnson?
[43:24.140 --> 43:25.020]  No, the kid in the background.
[43:25.020 --> 43:25.920]  Oh my God.
[43:25.940 --> 43:27.560]  He's like a Cleveland fan.
[43:27.820 --> 43:29.440]  And he is just like, ugh.
[43:29.720 --> 43:30.500]  We gotta save that.
[43:30.780 --> 43:32.340]  Well, he's watching a Spurs game.
[43:32.420 --> 43:35.880]  Yeah, he's watching the Spurs and the Cavaliers, so...
[43:35.880 --> 43:38.500]  Dude, the Spurs play in Austin a couple times a year.
[43:39.300 --> 43:39.700]  When?
[43:40.300 --> 43:42.500]  I think they're playing in February and March.
[43:42.680 --> 43:43.080]  Oh, cool.
[43:43.320 --> 43:46.000]  But I think they're gonna play four games in Austin this year.
[43:46.040 --> 43:46.920]  They played two last year.
[43:46.980 --> 43:47.800]  We went to both of them.
[43:48.200 --> 43:49.360]  But because of the Wemby...
[43:49.360 --> 43:50.740]  We got like almost...
[43:50.740 --> 43:54.760]  I would say like Loge-level tickets for, I don't know, like $350?
[43:55.140 --> 43:55.660]  That wasn't bad.
[43:56.180 --> 44:01.040]  To get those same tickets this season because of Wemby, they were like $1,400.
[44:01.760 --> 44:03.420]  So we did not get any.
[44:04.440 --> 44:05.720]  So have you worked for the Spurs?
[44:06.260 --> 44:07.600]  Or you work at the...
[44:07.600 --> 44:07.740]  Oh, yeah.
[44:07.800 --> 44:09.300]  Would you like to, you know, sponsor us?
[44:09.300 --> 44:10.380]  Dude, that's a great point.
[44:10.860 --> 44:12.440]  You mentioned being a Cleveland fan.
[44:13.200 --> 44:13.900]  Old story.
[44:14.260 --> 44:16.340]  Years ago, Millie's a LeBron fan.
[44:16.740 --> 44:17.740]  Still is, my daughter.
[44:17.740 --> 44:20.680]  And she was wearing her LeBron Cleveland jersey one day.
[44:20.740 --> 44:22.360]  And I took a photo of her and I posted it on Twitter.
[44:22.680 --> 44:25.320]  And the Cleveland Cavaliers PR department reached out to me.
[44:25.340 --> 44:26.880]  And they said, hey, we see Millie's a LeBron fan.
[44:27.280 --> 44:28.720]  Would you like to come to a game?
[44:29.200 --> 44:32.160]  She can do the high-five tunnel, maybe meet LeBron, do the whole thing.
[44:32.520 --> 44:34.260]  And so we flew up...
[44:34.260 --> 44:36.300]  This is seven years ago now.
[44:36.520 --> 44:37.380]  We flew up.
[44:38.060 --> 44:38.940]  They hosted us.
[44:39.000 --> 44:40.980]  We got a behind-the-scenes tour of...
[44:41.680 --> 44:42.420]  The Quicken Loans Arena.
[44:42.420 --> 44:43.020]  The Quicken Loans Arena.
[44:43.140 --> 44:44.120]  We saw the whole thing.
[44:44.520 --> 44:46.480]  The place is covered in fatheads because it's Dan Gilbert.
[44:46.480 --> 44:47.580]  He owns fatheads, you know.
[44:48.520 --> 44:49.180]  Comic Sans.
[44:49.500 --> 44:54.200]  Millie got to do the high-five thing on the court.
[44:54.540 --> 44:55.320]  LeBron didn't play that game.
[44:56.240 --> 44:59.020]  But she got to high-five Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving.
[44:59.580 --> 45:00.700]  And J.R. Smith, I think.
[45:01.200 --> 45:01.980]  The Henny God.
[45:03.320 --> 45:04.080]  That's so cool.
[45:04.160 --> 45:04.540]  It was awesome.
[45:04.680 --> 45:06.980]  So anyway, Spurs, if you want...
[45:07.780 --> 45:09.800]  We always find out about stuff after we've done it.
[45:09.900 --> 45:13.540]  We went to the Savannah Bananas game, sat in the nosebleeds of their tiny thing.
[45:13.640 --> 45:14.700]  And someone was like, hey, I work for them.
[45:14.700 --> 45:16.100]  Am I going to have you out there on the field?
[45:16.400 --> 45:18.220]  That was like, hey, you don't want to call a game?
[45:18.380 --> 45:18.920]  I was like, yeah.
[45:18.980 --> 45:20.560]  So I got to go back and call a game sometimes.
[45:20.580 --> 45:23.660]  So if you ever have anything, or if you can get Alan and Ginter on the horn.
[45:23.720 --> 45:24.740]  I still need to get him a card.
[45:25.300 --> 45:26.440]  It'd be a great wedding present.
[45:26.620 --> 45:27.880]  Jalen McDaniels.
[45:28.080 --> 45:30.080]  DeAndre Jordan, somehow still in the league.
[45:30.180 --> 45:30.620]  Love that dude.
[45:32.500 --> 45:33.140]  Nikola Jovic.
[45:34.520 --> 45:35.160]  The other...
[45:35.160 --> 45:36.700]  Not Joker.
[45:37.260 --> 45:37.940]  Very similar names.
[45:38.900 --> 45:39.540]  Sadiq Bey.
[45:39.980 --> 45:40.800]  He's wasted on Atlanta.
[45:40.940 --> 45:41.460]  I love that dude.
[45:42.180 --> 45:43.060]  Val Sunis.
[45:43.240 --> 45:44.520]  Talk about another...
[45:45.460 --> 45:46.780]  Player from a previous era.
[45:47.160 --> 45:47.600]  Joker.
[45:48.240 --> 45:49.080]  Save it, sleeve that.
[45:49.680 --> 45:50.360]  Amari Bailey.
[45:50.720 --> 45:50.960]  Rookie.
[45:51.180 --> 45:51.940]  Zach Levine.
[45:52.020 --> 45:52.740]  High voltage.
[45:54.680 --> 45:55.580]  Here's your Wimby.
[45:55.780 --> 45:56.900]  Can you sleeve that, too, please?
[45:57.480 --> 45:58.780]  All right, we got a few more.
[45:58.960 --> 46:00.820]  And then maybe we'll get one of these other boxes open.
[46:01.880 --> 46:05.680]  I feel like I kind of just glossed over this Wimby that you were really excited about.
[46:06.180 --> 46:08.000]  I was like, low-key about it.
[46:08.920 --> 46:09.680]  Like, just...
[46:09.680 --> 46:10.440]  Gordon Hayward.
[46:11.780 --> 46:12.820]  Malik Beasley.
[46:13.060 --> 46:15.100]  Lori Markinan is...
[46:15.100 --> 46:15.480]  All-Star.
[46:16.140 --> 46:16.980]  Who gets no respect.
[46:17.380 --> 46:18.280]  Bones Hyland.
[46:19.020 --> 46:19.860]  Kevin Hurter.
[46:20.140 --> 46:20.700]  I like Kevin Hurter.
[46:20.900 --> 46:21.920]  Kevin Durant.
[46:23.020 --> 46:24.380]  Anthony Black, rookie.
[46:24.660 --> 46:25.860]  And then look at this.
[46:25.860 --> 46:26.520]  This is for you.
[46:26.620 --> 46:27.500]  I got this for you, Sammy.
[46:27.880 --> 46:28.400]  Hey!
[46:28.760 --> 46:33.220]  LeBron James becomes the all-time career scorer.
[46:34.940 --> 46:36.220]  Let's sleeve that.
[46:36.560 --> 46:37.400]  Do you want to double sleeve it?
[46:37.400 --> 46:38.320]  No, we'll just...
[46:39.680 --> 46:42.540]  The chat's asking, could we see the Spurs card again?
[46:42.960 --> 46:43.460]  The Wimby card?
[46:43.820 --> 46:45.500]  Do we look at chat?
[46:47.620 --> 46:50.400]  It's just his base rookie, so it's probably not worth much.
[46:50.680 --> 46:51.580]  It's worth more than it should be.
[46:52.560 --> 46:53.660]  Sammy, you can have that.
[46:55.920 --> 46:58.320]  What if this is worth a million?
[46:58.560 --> 46:58.960]  It's not.
[46:59.160 --> 47:00.260]  It might be worth a little bit.
[47:00.280 --> 47:01.220]  It might be worth 10, 20 bucks.
[47:01.360 --> 47:01.980]  That's cool.
[47:02.720 --> 47:04.140]  It's our gift to you.
[47:04.440 --> 47:04.960]  Thank you.
[47:04.960 --> 47:05.620]  I'm hanging out with this thing.
[47:05.680 --> 47:08.380]  There's the Wimby black back.
[47:09.520 --> 47:11.020]  Okay, if you want to sleeve these guys.
[47:11.120 --> 47:14.320]  Someone was also fussing about not seeing the kid in the background, but I lost it.
[47:14.640 --> 47:16.440]  Big Al Horford.
[47:17.800 --> 47:18.560]  Love him.
[47:19.760 --> 47:22.120]  Anthony Edwards, future face of the NBA right there.
[47:23.040 --> 47:27.200]  Ayode Samo, Jaden Ivey, Uzman Dieng.
[47:28.080 --> 47:29.200]  We got a Giannis.
[47:29.760 --> 47:31.020]  Oops, retro card.
[47:31.040 --> 47:31.600]  That's a cool card.
[47:31.820 --> 47:32.520]  It is cool.
[47:33.220 --> 47:34.440]  Leonard Miller rookie.
[47:34.800 --> 47:35.400]  Oh, here we go.
[47:35.540 --> 47:35.880]  This is cool.
[47:36.200 --> 47:36.940]  Keontae Johnson.
[47:37.280 --> 47:38.080]  We got next.
[47:39.780 --> 47:41.760]  They do this parallel every year for rookies.
[47:41.840 --> 47:42.340]  We got next.
[47:42.620 --> 47:44.060]  And it's always ugly as shit.
[47:44.240 --> 47:45.300]  This is not too bad this year.
[47:45.560 --> 47:48.520]  All right, we're going to get through this.
[47:49.160 --> 47:50.480]  I know, we only opened up one box.
[47:50.600 --> 47:50.740]  Sorry.
[47:51.300 --> 47:51.980]  It's been jazzed.
[47:51.980 --> 47:53.020]  They just came out.
[47:53.180 --> 47:54.640]  We just want to talk about basketball with Sammy.
[47:55.100 --> 47:56.600]  Aaron Gordon, I do not like.
[47:56.780 --> 47:58.260]  Jeremy Grant, I do like.
[47:58.340 --> 48:00.220]  He should be the dunk champion.
[48:00.540 --> 48:01.120]  He should be.
[48:01.700 --> 48:02.100]  Who?
[48:02.540 --> 48:04.140]  You mean Aaron Gordon because he got beat by Levine?
[48:04.320 --> 48:04.460]  Yeah.
[48:05.060 --> 48:06.140]  I don't like Levine either.
[48:06.540 --> 48:10.160]  Kevin Love, that dude is like 35 going on 45.
[48:11.380 --> 48:14.160]  Trey Young, villain of the NBA.
[48:14.300 --> 48:15.000]  Shave your head.
[48:15.800 --> 48:16.780]  His worst hair in the NBA.
[48:17.140 --> 48:19.600]  Jordan Hawkins, and that's including Alex Caruso.
[48:21.020 --> 48:23.880]  Cam Reddish, resurrecting his career as a Laker.
[48:24.000 --> 48:24.900]  Somehow starting.
[48:25.980 --> 48:27.080]  Yeah, why is he starting?
[48:27.080 --> 48:27.880]  I don't know why.
[48:28.000 --> 48:29.420]  I do not know why he's starting.
[48:29.420 --> 48:30.700]  Maxwell Lewis, rookie.
[48:31.460 --> 48:32.060]  And then here we go.
[48:32.160 --> 48:33.740]  Oh shit, LeBron Ignition.
[48:34.400 --> 48:35.760]  Now that might be...
[48:36.740 --> 48:37.160]  Oh no.
[48:37.320 --> 48:37.900]  Oh wait, sorry.
[48:39.920 --> 48:41.140]  I'm not holding on to that one.
[48:41.260 --> 48:42.220]  Wait, wait, let's trade.
[48:42.560 --> 48:42.960]  Let's trade.
[48:44.280 --> 48:45.300]  Let's see what that one's worth.
[48:46.760 --> 48:48.760]  Tune in next week to see if it's worth anything.
[48:48.860 --> 48:49.840]  Yeah, we'll see who won.
[48:49.840 --> 48:50.500]  And then we might get it.
[48:51.200 --> 48:51.780]  Sammy or me.
[48:51.860 --> 48:52.720]  Patrick Beverley.
[48:54.640 --> 48:56.920]  The Marcus Smart of every team he's on.
[48:57.040 --> 48:57.740]  Yeah, exactly.
[48:58.860 --> 48:59.820]  Peyton Watson.
[49:00.040 --> 49:01.220]  Danny Green.
[49:02.240 --> 49:03.380]  Somehow still in the NBA.
[49:03.600 --> 49:04.420]  Kyle Lowry.
[49:04.820 --> 49:07.380]  D'Angelo Russell, one of the least popular players in the NBA.
[49:10.060 --> 49:11.060]  Jalen Hood-Shafino.
[49:13.040 --> 49:13.580]  Who we got here?
[49:13.920 --> 49:14.640]  LeBron James.
[49:15.060 --> 49:16.580]  Oh, let's go.
[49:17.000 --> 49:18.440]  And then SGA.
[49:19.100 --> 49:20.120]  Hoopla card.
[49:20.220 --> 49:20.800]  That's really pretty.
[49:20.940 --> 49:22.400]  Signature old man move.
[49:23.240 --> 49:24.560]  The old man dunk, dude.
[49:24.700 --> 49:25.640]  Do you need a sleep foot?
[49:26.040 --> 49:27.180]  Oh yeah, thank you.
[49:27.780 --> 49:28.860]  And I...
[49:29.420 --> 49:30.920]  I should know how to put this on.
[49:31.020 --> 49:31.460]  It's a sleep.
[49:31.480 --> 49:32.440]  Just like twist it.
[49:32.440 --> 49:32.820]  It's easy.
[49:33.100 --> 49:34.380]  Anthony Simons.
[49:34.660 --> 49:35.940]  I keep waiting for him to break out.
[49:36.440 --> 49:37.260]  Terry Eason.
[49:38.220 --> 49:39.160]  AJ Griffin.
[49:39.460 --> 49:40.100]  I have no opinion of.
[49:40.200 --> 49:40.560]  Zion.
[49:42.460 --> 49:43.720]  Oh, Johnny Davis.
[49:44.460 --> 49:45.800]  Cam Whitmore rookie.
[49:46.300 --> 49:48.020]  We got ourselves a Eamon Thompson.
[49:48.380 --> 49:49.180]  That's nice.
[49:49.860 --> 49:52.620]  And then a Obi Toppin purple parallel.
[49:53.760 --> 49:54.020]  Cool.
[49:55.940 --> 49:56.740]  Obi Toppin.
[49:57.680 --> 50:00.420]  I was really hoping that he would work out in New York, but he didn't.
[50:00.560 --> 50:02.520]  We'll see if he has better success in Indiana.
[50:02.840 --> 50:04.260]  Indiana's an interesting team this year.
[50:04.360 --> 50:04.760]  Interesting team.
[50:05.200 --> 50:05.920]  Gary Trent Jr.
[50:06.620 --> 50:08.140]  We got Evan Fournier.
[50:08.440 --> 50:09.080]  I do not like.
[50:09.540 --> 50:10.580]  PJ Washington.
[50:10.840 --> 50:11.960]  Don't look up Fournier on Google.
[50:12.260 --> 50:13.260]  Derek Rose.
[50:14.920 --> 50:15.720]  Simone Fontecchio.
[50:16.120 --> 50:16.720]  Ooh, that's funny.
[50:17.700 --> 50:18.500]  Space rookie.
[50:19.520 --> 50:20.240]  Moses Moody.
[50:20.940 --> 50:23.320]  And then a green KCB.
[50:23.560 --> 50:23.980]  Number 10.
[50:23.980 --> 50:24.440]  99.
[50:25.080 --> 50:25.660]  There you go.
[50:25.940 --> 50:26.900]  Cantavious Caldwell Pope.
[50:27.940 --> 50:29.940]  He won a title with the Lakers, I believe.
[50:30.120 --> 50:30.460]  He did.
[50:30.600 --> 50:30.860]  2020.
[50:31.060 --> 50:33.660]  And then he plays for Denver, so he got one last year.
[50:33.680 --> 50:35.080]  And then he won a title for Denver, actually.
[50:35.140 --> 50:35.740]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[50:37.560 --> 50:40.100]  I can't show the camera because it's so detailed.
[50:40.220 --> 50:41.060]  Like, you have to look in the background.
[50:41.460 --> 50:42.700]  But look at that guy's face.
[50:43.280 --> 50:43.800]  Oh, yeah.
[50:44.260 --> 50:44.840]  He's not happy.
[50:45.140 --> 50:45.300]  Yeah.
[50:46.460 --> 50:47.180]  Matisse Thibault.
[50:48.360 --> 50:49.360]  Hell of a defensive player.
[50:49.420 --> 50:50.300]  He needs to figure out his offense.
[50:50.300 --> 50:51.700]  Alex Caruso.
[50:52.220 --> 50:53.160]  Love Alex Caruso.
[50:54.180 --> 50:55.280]  Watching that kid dunk is awesome.
[50:55.380 --> 50:56.320]  Julius Randle.
[50:57.560 --> 50:58.800]  Knicks need to get out from under him.
[50:59.160 --> 51:00.220]  Tim Hardaway Jr.
[51:01.520 --> 51:04.960]  Markel Fultz is better than I thought he would ever be.
[51:06.060 --> 51:06.840]  Klay Thompson.
[51:07.120 --> 51:07.480]  Oh, here we go.
[51:07.480 --> 51:08.380]  Jordan Walsh, space rookie.
[51:09.380 --> 51:10.420]  Everybody loves Jordan Walsh.
[51:10.580 --> 51:13.080]  If you're a Celtics fan, he's the only draft pick we have this year.
[51:13.120 --> 51:13.520]  Oh, yeah.
[51:13.520 --> 51:14.180]  He has a picture.
[51:14.660 --> 51:16.540]  Second round.
[51:17.500 --> 51:19.300]  He's currently playing for the Maine Red Claws.
[51:19.300 --> 51:20.580]  Someone on...
[51:20.580 --> 51:20.880]  We're the Maine Celtics.
[51:21.000 --> 51:21.580]  I believe we changed our name.
[51:21.600 --> 51:21.920]  Chad.
[51:22.140 --> 51:22.560]  Jordan Hawkins.
[51:22.800 --> 51:23.740]  ...does breaks.
[51:23.900 --> 51:26.380]  And they said that you've bought into their eBay breaks.
[51:26.880 --> 51:27.640]  Oh, I probably have.
[51:27.680 --> 51:30.360]  And they said, don't think you ever got a good card, though.
[51:31.480 --> 51:32.340]  Isn't that right?
[51:32.600 --> 51:33.880]  I bought into a lot of breaks.
[51:34.140 --> 51:34.960]  Good to see you, buddy.
[51:36.220 --> 51:36.940]  Bobby Portis.
[51:37.160 --> 51:39.680]  He might be a contender for six-man of the year this year.
[51:39.940 --> 51:41.760]  K.C. or Kristaps Porzingis.
[51:41.820 --> 51:42.520]  Wow, he's Celtic.
[51:43.380 --> 51:44.380]  He's doing good this year.
[51:44.400 --> 51:45.320]  He is doing fantastic.
[51:45.420 --> 51:47.420]  He's hurt this week, but he's only going to miss three games.
[51:47.420 --> 51:49.140]  Mason Plumlee, I do not like.
[51:50.460 --> 51:51.940]  Keegan Murray, I do like.
[51:52.380 --> 51:54.560]  Amoni Bates is alright, so far.
[51:55.700 --> 51:57.100]  Brandon Miller, rookie.
[51:57.180 --> 51:58.100]  There you go, that's nice.
[51:59.900 --> 52:00.960]  Noah Clowney, rookie.
[52:01.160 --> 52:03.000]  And then an Ignition, Jett Howard.
[52:03.520 --> 52:05.080]  I gotta find out about these Ignition cards.
[52:05.320 --> 52:06.700]  I realize we haven't got our auto yet.
[52:07.140 --> 52:08.020]  Oh, we didn't?
[52:08.320 --> 52:08.960]  We haven't got our auto.
[52:09.260 --> 52:10.960]  It's gotta be right here, I hope.
[52:11.400 --> 52:12.840]  Save the best for last.
[52:13.160 --> 52:13.940]  I think it is.
[52:14.920 --> 52:17.400]  Cam Thomas, the other Cam, who plays for Brooklyn.
[52:17.420 --> 52:18.280]  I like him better.
[52:19.200 --> 52:21.080]  Jimmy Butler, Jimmy Buckets.
[52:21.180 --> 52:24.100]  Miles Turner, this is his emo year, Jimmy Butler.
[52:24.340 --> 52:25.140]  I like that, I like that.
[52:25.340 --> 52:26.540]  Reggie Bullock.
[52:26.980 --> 52:27.860]  It's not a phase.
[52:29.900 --> 52:31.520]  Tristan Vukicic, I don't know who that is.
[52:32.400 --> 52:33.800]  Here we go, here we go.
[52:33.920 --> 52:34.520]  We've got our Victor.
[52:34.960 --> 52:36.180]  NBA Hoops, that's nice.
[52:36.460 --> 52:37.500]  That's a good card.
[52:39.420 --> 52:41.940]  Our auto is going to be a Rookie Inc.
[52:42.060 --> 52:44.260]  for Julian Straufer.
[52:45.900 --> 52:47.160]  He plays for the Nuggets.
[52:47.160 --> 52:48.120]  He plays for the Nuggets.
[52:48.580 --> 52:50.600]  So, a bit of a letdown there.
[52:51.400 --> 52:53.340]  But look at Wemby showing you his little booty.
[52:54.620 --> 52:55.800]  He's like, it's over there.
[52:56.060 --> 52:57.000]  Emphasis on little.
[52:57.260 --> 52:58.660]  Attack the Rack.
[52:59.100 --> 52:59.520]  Bronze.
[53:00.800 --> 53:02.360]  That's interesting, I'll have to see what that's worth.
[53:02.420 --> 53:03.200]  I haven't even seen it before.
[53:05.580 --> 53:06.840]  I bet that's worth something.
[53:07.040 --> 53:08.740]  Okay, all right, we made it through.
[53:08.940 --> 53:11.280]  These sound effects are cooking me up.
[53:11.560 --> 53:12.200]  It's crazy.
[53:12.200 --> 53:13.040]  No more Black Packs.
[53:13.660 --> 53:14.560]  We've still got a few more minutes.
[53:14.840 --> 53:17.020]  Let's open up some of last year's Prism, what do you say?
[53:17.060 --> 53:18.520]  I've got to figure out how to make money on this.
[53:18.600 --> 53:19.660]  I really want to.
[53:21.220 --> 53:22.360]  Some Kate Cunningham.
[53:22.500 --> 53:23.960]  This one we're looking for Kate Cunningham.
[53:24.080 --> 53:25.980]  We're looking for Scotty Barnes.
[53:26.280 --> 53:27.660]  We're looking for...
[53:28.260 --> 53:30.060]  Oh, Evan Mobley, I guess.
[53:30.960 --> 53:32.220]  Jalen Greene, probably.
[53:33.180 --> 53:34.020]  Let's see what we get.
[53:34.080 --> 53:34.660]  We'll see what we see.
[53:35.520 --> 53:37.160]  I've opened up so fucking many of these.
[53:38.440 --> 53:39.160]  Andre Drummond.
[53:42.460 --> 53:43.560]  Silver, old card.
[53:44.040 --> 53:45.560]  Instant Impact, Kate Cunningham.
[53:46.080 --> 53:47.660]  Isn't that what you want, is Kate Cunningham?
[53:47.760 --> 53:49.340]  It's such a fucking ugly insert.
[53:50.160 --> 53:51.620]  I can't stand that year.
[53:51.720 --> 53:53.460]  Do all of them have that silver laminate?
[53:54.760 --> 53:55.140]  Prism.
[53:55.360 --> 53:56.860]  These do, these are Prism, yeah.
[53:57.060 --> 54:05.660]  There's some that are about one in every ten is called Silver Prism, so they're even shinier.
[54:05.740 --> 54:06.360]  If we get one, I'll show you.
[54:06.660 --> 54:08.800]  Josh Richardson, Celtics card, no longer a Celtics.
[54:08.900 --> 54:11.960]  Jeremiah Robinson Earl, rookie with a print scan across the bottom of it.
[54:12.520 --> 54:13.320]  Isaiah Jackson.
[54:15.200 --> 54:16.000]  Nothing yet.
[54:16.280 --> 54:17.500]  Okay, that's cool.
[54:18.860 --> 54:21.100]  Emanuel, quickly again, last year's quickly.
[54:21.460 --> 54:23.720]  Jermaine O'Neal, Malice in the Palace right there.
[54:23.740 --> 54:25.340]  Is he related to Shaquille O'Neal?
[54:25.680 --> 54:26.780]  No, but they played at the same time.
[54:27.640 --> 54:30.440]  Royce O'Neal, Purple Wave Parallel.
[54:31.120 --> 54:32.360]  Is he related to Shaquille O'Neal?
[54:32.440 --> 54:33.480]  Yeah, he is actually.
[54:34.740 --> 54:36.860]  Luka Doncic, Dominance, that's a nice little insert.
[54:37.040 --> 54:37.540]  We'll just leave that.
[54:38.860 --> 54:39.800]  These cards look weird.
[54:40.360 --> 54:42.220]  This is, what variant is this?
[54:42.680 --> 54:43.560]  That's Purple Wave.
[54:45.020 --> 54:45.900]  Anthony Simon.
[54:46.660 --> 54:47.700]  Jalen Green, base rookie.
[54:47.920 --> 54:50.900]  It's got that print scan line across it.
[54:50.960 --> 54:51.920]  Can you see it right there?
[54:52.180 --> 54:53.080]  Oh yeah, I see it.
[54:54.320 --> 54:55.780]  That destroys any value.
[54:56.180 --> 54:57.300]  That's a defect?
[54:57.700 --> 54:59.320]  Can you take it back to the factory?
[54:59.500 --> 55:00.720]  You can, actually.
[55:01.260 --> 55:03.120]  If you care enough, you can probably send it to them
[55:03.120 --> 55:04.740]  and they'll send you a replacement or something of equal value.
[55:06.280 --> 55:07.160]  Rudy Gay.
[55:08.860 --> 55:09.740]  Green Parallel.
[55:09.800 --> 55:11.540]  But that's a Green Parallel?
[55:11.760 --> 55:13.600]  Yeah, Green Prison Parallel.
[55:13.760 --> 55:15.580]  Bones Highland, this is called a Cracked Ice.
[55:15.980 --> 55:16.600]  That's a cool name.
[55:16.600 --> 55:17.820]  It's got a lens flare.
[55:17.980 --> 55:19.000]  Yeah, Cracked Ice Parallel.
[55:22.040 --> 55:23.260]  Is this worth?
[55:24.560 --> 55:26.600]  It's worth more, but Bones Highland's not worth anything.
[55:27.720 --> 55:28.580]  He's good, though.
[55:28.580 --> 55:29.620]  He is good.
[55:29.760 --> 55:33.060]  And if he ever becomes a decent rotation player,
[55:33.240 --> 55:34.260]  that might be worth a little bit.
[55:35.340 --> 55:36.240]  A lot of ifs.
[55:36.340 --> 55:38.340]  Demar DeRozan's dying on the bulls.
[55:38.340 --> 55:39.580]  Robert Covington.
[55:40.360 --> 55:40.860]  Here you go.
[55:41.020 --> 55:42.080]  So here's what I was talking about.
[55:42.460 --> 55:43.480]  A Silver Parallel.
[55:43.900 --> 55:44.720]  This is Compazzo.
[55:46.180 --> 55:49.020]  We would have loved it to be somebody other than Facundo Compazzo to get the silver.
[55:49.460 --> 55:51.760]  These are worth about ten times as much as the regular version,
[55:51.860 --> 55:52.980]  but if you'll see, it's even shiny.
[55:53.060 --> 55:56.960]  Well, ten times one is ten, so I guess this is worth ten dollars, probably.
[55:57.740 --> 55:58.460]  Justin Holliday.
[55:58.840 --> 56:00.600]  The less talented Holliday brother.
[56:00.800 --> 56:02.040]  Kind of bent, though. Is that bad?
[56:02.160 --> 56:02.660]  Nah, it's fine.
[56:02.920 --> 56:05.560]  These cards are notorious for that bend.
[56:05.560 --> 56:06.960]  It's a production bend, so...
[56:07.840 --> 56:11.340]  It probably has something to do with the card stock, I guess.
[56:13.080 --> 56:14.800]  Nikolai Alexander Walker.
[56:16.840 --> 56:17.800]  Theo Maledon.
[56:18.560 --> 56:19.520]  Dirk Nowitzki.
[56:19.780 --> 56:21.020]  And then Serge Abaka.
[56:21.860 --> 56:22.340]  Serge.
[56:23.540 --> 56:24.840]  At a cooking show.
[56:25.180 --> 56:28.000]  Wow, Gracie. Wow. Wow.
[56:28.580 --> 56:29.680]  All right, we have time to open.
[56:30.080 --> 56:32.040]  I was going to open these. Oh, shit.
[56:32.500 --> 56:34.320]  We have time to open just a little bit more.
[56:34.320 --> 56:36.420]  Let's open up this box of Fast Break Mosaic.
[56:36.580 --> 56:37.180]  Oh, Fast Break.
[56:37.340 --> 56:41.060]  I paid $250... $284 for this today.
[56:42.000 --> 56:43.160]  That's probably not a question for this.
[56:43.280 --> 56:45.460]  Is that a write-off for the show?
[56:45.840 --> 56:48.620]  It would be if I'd asked Gracie to buy it, but I bought it.
[56:49.080 --> 56:49.400]  Damn.
[56:50.220 --> 56:51.360]  I'm footing the bill on this one.
[56:51.920 --> 56:53.140]  All right, we're going to open up a few of these.
[56:54.980 --> 56:56.080]  There's going to be an odd one here.
[56:56.260 --> 56:57.680]  I want a good one. Let's see what we get.
[56:58.400 --> 56:59.640]  LeBron James. You can have that.
[56:59.920 --> 57:02.040]  Jonte Murray. Markel Fultz. Jalen Bronson.
[57:02.080 --> 57:03.360]  Quentin Grimes. Desmond Bain.
[57:04.320 --> 57:05.280]  Josh Hart. Here we go.
[57:05.380 --> 57:09.560]  Obie Toppen. Blue... I guess probably Disco Parallel, they call that.
[57:09.680 --> 57:10.700]  That's really nice.
[57:12.340 --> 57:13.040]  Ousmane Diagne.
[57:14.100 --> 57:16.000]  Andrew Nembhard. Rookie. Base.
[57:16.080 --> 57:17.260]  We're going to blow through this.
[57:17.360 --> 57:18.960]  There's one Otto in here, I believe.
[57:19.140 --> 57:20.700]  Let's see if we can get the Otto before we...
[57:20.700 --> 57:21.700]  How many packs are in here?
[57:21.720 --> 57:23.300]  Oh my God, there's so many.
[57:23.500 --> 57:24.160]  We're not going to get through all of them.
[57:25.700 --> 57:28.580]  Jared Vanderbilt. Zach Levine. Jimmy Butler.
[57:28.840 --> 57:31.100]  Paul George. De'Aaron Fox.
[57:31.200 --> 57:32.820]  Josh Okoge. Keldon Johnson.
[57:34.320 --> 57:34.700]  There he is.
[57:36.300 --> 57:37.760]  Fucking Bryce McGowan.
[57:38.320 --> 57:39.200]  Is he even in the league?
[57:40.280 --> 57:41.500]  Oh, that sucks.
[57:41.720 --> 57:42.520]  It's signed.
[57:43.340 --> 57:44.620]  And it's the Hornets.
[57:45.960 --> 57:47.620]  Number two... fuck me.
[57:48.500 --> 57:49.240]  That would have been nice.
[57:49.440 --> 57:51.000]  Number one of 25.
[57:51.440 --> 57:53.040]  Wow, but he doesn't even play anymore?
[57:53.760 --> 57:55.380]  I mean, it's probably the G League.
[57:55.900 --> 57:56.600]  Gatorade League.
[57:57.280 --> 57:59.840]  That's sick, though. You have a really rare card.
[58:00.540 --> 58:01.480]  It's Gatorade League?
[58:02.180 --> 58:03.680]  I feel like I should have known that.
[58:05.660 --> 58:06.260]  Patrick Baldwin.
[58:06.260 --> 58:09.140]  I thought it would be like A team, B team, but it's like...
[58:09.140 --> 58:09.880]  Gatorade.
[58:11.160 --> 58:11.880]  Tyrese Martin.
[58:12.120 --> 58:14.520]  We'll open up one more. We'll open up these as we leave.
[58:14.580 --> 58:15.600]  You're doing so good.
[58:16.020 --> 58:17.280]  You're going so fast.
[58:17.880 --> 58:19.580]  So that was the hit of the box.
[58:19.600 --> 58:20.640]  You think there might be another one?
[58:20.820 --> 58:22.360]  There'll be other hits, but that'll be the only auto.
[58:23.000 --> 58:27.980]  Gary Trent Jr. Spencer Dinway. Yanis. Cam Johnson. Geoff Green. Uncle Geoff.
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.660]  Jalen McDaniels. Wendell Carter Jr. Big Cat.
[58:33.520 --> 58:33.960]  Hello.
[58:34.920 --> 58:36.240]  Chet Holmgren. There you go.
[58:37.060 --> 58:39.080]  Chet, he might win Rookie of the Year this year.
[58:40.740 --> 58:43.540]  Dale and Terry. And then, oh, here we get the alternate.
[58:43.680 --> 58:45.140]  This is nice. Jaden Ivey rookie.
[58:46.100 --> 58:46.840]  That is pretty.
[58:47.620 --> 58:50.600]  I like Jaden Ivey. I wish he was a little better.
[58:50.640 --> 58:51.100]  Be good.
[58:52.240 --> 58:53.860]  The Pistons have a lot of pieces.
[58:54.160 --> 58:57.080]  I really feel like they should be where...
[58:57.080 --> 58:58.340]  Just a step behind Orlando.
[58:58.480 --> 58:59.580]  I don't know why they're so bad.
[59:00.660 --> 59:01.820]  They're like 2-12.
[59:03.000 --> 59:04.160]  Could be coaching staff.
[59:04.960 --> 59:08.280]  Ime Udoka, for all of his faults, whatever that may be.
[59:08.520 --> 59:09.880]  He's coaching the shit out them Rockets.
[59:10.340 --> 59:11.060]  Phenomenal coach.
[59:12.100 --> 59:13.920]  Bobby Portis. Bol Bol.
[59:14.720 --> 59:15.560]  Steph Curry.
[59:16.420 --> 59:17.980]  As good as Webinyama.
[59:20.040 --> 59:20.900]  DeAndre Ayton.
[59:21.460 --> 59:24.540]  Lumelo. He just had to cover up a tattoo.
[59:24.860 --> 59:26.300]  He has to wear a patch. You know about that?
[59:26.520 --> 59:28.980]  He'll wear a patch on his neck for the rest of his NBA career.
[59:29.900 --> 59:33.920]  It's the logo to his clothing brand, LaFrance, I think is what it's called.
[59:34.440 --> 59:35.780]  And so there are no corporate logos.
[59:36.140 --> 59:37.500]  Even if it's his name.
[59:37.600 --> 59:39.200]  Because they're not making money off of it.
[59:39.440 --> 59:41.680]  Because his middle name is LaFrance, I think. Is that right?
[59:41.980 --> 59:43.000]  I don't know that...
[59:43.000 --> 59:45.460]  Lumelo LaFrance?
[59:45.680 --> 59:46.340]  I don't know how it works.
[59:47.480 --> 59:51.400]  The NBA has so many weird rules about certain things.
[59:51.600 --> 59:53.600]  No corporate logos that aren't affiliated.
[59:53.880 --> 59:57.040]  No bandanas. There was a whole thing about no bandanas.
[59:57.800 --> 59:58.960]  There's like NBA ones.
[59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.380]  I feel like Dennis...
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.360]  I feel like Dennis Rodman would have had like a Playboy bunny tattoo or something.
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:06.080]  Oh, I'm sure he does.
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.220]  Who was the guy, the bird man?
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.420]  Or if you have like a Mickey Mouse tattoo, you can't show...
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.120]  He was on the Heat.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:19.060]  He was on the Heat. That dude has two NBA rings and he was one of the early catfished guys, right?
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:19.960]  Yeah, he was.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:21.420]  Yeah, he was.
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:22.780]  He was catfished.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.360]  How are you seven foot getting catfished?
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:27.980]  I don't know, right?
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:29.880]  Manti Teo, right?
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:31.420]  I guess so.
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:36.960]  We're gonna go out on this. Bogdan, Tyrese, Boban, Bojan. Oh my God!
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:38.000]  What?
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:41.720]  We got Bogdan, Bojan, and Boban.
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.440]  That's gotta be something.
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:47.060]  We have to save this.
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.620]  None of them are related to it.
[01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:51.060]  Bogdan, Bojan, and Bogdan. All together.
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:55.140]  These are the three Bo guys in the NBA. We got them all right.
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:56.820]  Three I get mixed up.
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:10.280]  Isaiah Stewart, Beef Stew, P.J. Tucker, Laurie Markenden again, Josh Christopher, Trey Murphy, Silver Prism, Ryan Rollins rookie, Marjon Beauchamp, who's actually pretty good, and then Christian Brown again.
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:16.240]  And that'll do it for another break show. Thank you to Sammy for coming in and spending the day with us.

[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:14.260]  Yeah, but their eyes usually darken and then they say, like, let's do it.
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:15.580]  And their name is Sidepiece.
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:17.540]  We'll see you next week.
