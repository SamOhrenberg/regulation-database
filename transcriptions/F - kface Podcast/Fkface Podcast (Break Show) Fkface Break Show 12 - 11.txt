[00:09.600 --> 00:13.060]  Hello, and welcome to the F*** Face Break Show.
[00:13.180 --> 00:18.220]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as almost always, my beautiful wife...
[00:18.220 --> 00:19.100]  I thought they were going to cut to me.
[00:19.240 --> 00:20.600]  That was so cool. That was so close.
[00:20.820 --> 00:24.220]  And my beautiful man partner, Eric.
[00:24.520 --> 00:25.780]  Thank you. Sorry, Gavin.
[00:26.380 --> 00:28.480]  You spend just as much time with Eric these days.
[00:28.860 --> 00:29.720]  Not a choice.
[00:29.980 --> 00:32.860]  Dude, Eric and I spend a lot of time together, and I don't mind any of it.
[00:32.920 --> 00:33.640]  No, it's nice. I love it.
[00:33.640 --> 00:35.060]  I spend time with his wife, and she's a delight.
[00:35.360 --> 00:36.200]  I agree.
[00:36.200 --> 00:39.020]  I spend time with his wife on the Clutch My Pearls podcast.
[00:39.180 --> 00:41.300]  What are you doing at the beginning of the show?
[00:41.560 --> 00:46.860]  If anything, f***facepod.com is where you can sign up to support us directly.
[00:47.600 --> 00:49.520]  You can just support us by listening.
[00:49.800 --> 00:51.340]  We don't have anything.
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.600]  But you can just listen, download, tell your friends, tell your book club, tell your therapist.
[00:56.920 --> 00:57.580]  Tell your therapist.
[00:57.900 --> 00:59.080]  Clutch My Pearls, you know.
[00:59.820 --> 01:00.200]  I gotta get...
[01:00.720 --> 01:01.420]  Did you get it out? Are you good?
[01:01.660 --> 01:04.240]  I could probably get some more, but I'll get it later.
[01:04.520 --> 01:05.940]  Geoff, what are we doing today on the break show?
[01:05.940 --> 01:07.640]  We're gonna do a lot of fun stuff today, Eric.
[01:07.720 --> 01:12.780]  The big thing we're gonna do, we've been holding on to this bad boy for a while.
[01:12.940 --> 01:14.140]  It's one of those hit parades.
[01:14.160 --> 01:15.240]  He's gonna show you in just a second.
[01:15.260 --> 01:16.040]  It's the last one we have.
[01:16.040 --> 01:16.720]  There it is.
[01:16.840 --> 01:19.540]  This one's a 2023 Series 3 autographed football.
[01:19.940 --> 01:20.120]  Wow!
[01:20.260 --> 01:21.280]  What if it's a Travis Kelce?
[01:22.280 --> 01:26.060]  Hoping for a Mr. Swift, if we get lucky.
[01:27.100 --> 01:29.160]  Maybe a helmet throw in Mahomes.
[01:29.380 --> 01:30.000]  We'll just have to see.
[01:30.140 --> 01:31.140]  Dude, that was so cool.
[01:31.220 --> 01:33.300]  What happened? I only saw like a second of it.
[01:33.320 --> 01:33.960]  He was upset.
[01:34.100 --> 01:35.440]  And he cried about it.
[01:35.440 --> 01:36.400]  And I think that's fine.
[01:36.600 --> 01:37.680]  We should be allowed to cry.
[01:37.820 --> 01:41.560]  I think they're having a tough season where some losses should have been wins.
[01:41.700 --> 01:45.280]  And he's frustrated with his receivers who don't seem to care as much as he does.
[01:45.420 --> 01:47.540]  And don't seem to care about lining up on sides.
[01:47.640 --> 01:49.300]  Or catching the football.
[01:49.940 --> 01:51.560]  Is Travis Kelce one of those people?
[01:51.620 --> 01:53.280]  No, Travis Kelce is very good at his job.
[01:53.280 --> 01:54.640]  He's the only bright spot on that team.
[01:55.160 --> 01:57.280]  But Geoff, we're opening a football. What else do we have?
[01:57.920 --> 02:00.360]  We're gonna open up... people have been asking for it.
[02:00.380 --> 02:02.500]  They've been saying, hey, dickhead, get to the mail.
[02:02.620 --> 02:03.300]  We have so much mail.
[02:03.320 --> 02:04.300]  Hey, asshole, I sent you mail.
[02:04.300 --> 02:04.880]  So much mail.
[02:04.980 --> 02:06.260]  Why didn't you open it? And you're right.
[02:06.420 --> 02:07.120]  We're gonna get to some.
[02:07.520 --> 02:09.020]  We're gonna get to some of the mail.
[02:09.140 --> 02:10.040]  We're gonna get to some of the mail.
[02:10.240 --> 02:11.480]  We're also gonna pack sack.
[02:11.940 --> 02:16.300]  But first, as we always do, we're going to...
[02:19.000 --> 02:20.400]  Go over our values.
[02:20.800 --> 02:21.380]  Go over our valuables.
[02:21.520 --> 02:24.980]  That is what we always do. The thing you know. And Geoff knows too.
[02:25.520 --> 02:27.240]  Here's what freaked me out there.
[02:27.440 --> 02:31.220]  I was just seeing myself in the mirror and it looks like my shirt is off-centered.
[02:31.220 --> 02:35.500]  And then I wondered, have I been wearing this hoodie this entire time with an off-centered logo?
[02:35.640 --> 02:38.360]  Well, it is a San Antonio Brahma's shirt.
[02:38.380 --> 02:39.840]  I can't figure out if it...
[02:39.840 --> 02:40.780]  Are they still a team?
[02:41.100 --> 02:42.760]  I think so. I think so.
[02:42.900 --> 02:43.320]  Are they?
[02:43.520 --> 02:45.860]  Yeah, I think that San Antonio made the cut.
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.560]  The XFL and the USFL have merged.
[02:48.780 --> 02:50.820]  I think it might be off-centered.
[02:51.060 --> 02:52.960]  Yeah, I think it might be. How do I never notice that?
[02:53.040 --> 02:54.120]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:54.360 --> 02:55.740]  It keeps you warm in the cold days.
[02:56.520 --> 02:59.300]  I think that what happened is the USFL and the XFL merged.
[02:59.320 --> 02:59.560]  Yes.
[02:59.560 --> 03:00.620]  And they kept eight teams.
[03:00.620 --> 03:01.040]  They did.
[03:01.480 --> 03:02.140]  Between the...
[03:02.140 --> 03:03.260]  Arlington Renegades!
[03:03.680 --> 03:04.580]  DC Defenders.
[03:04.680 --> 03:05.080]  Battle Hawks.
[03:05.220 --> 03:07.800]  San Antonio Brahmas!
[03:08.140 --> 03:09.680]  And the St. Louis Battle Hawks.
[03:09.840 --> 03:12.540]  Along with the Birmingham Stallions, the Houston Gamblers.
[03:12.660 --> 03:14.260]  That's three teams in Texas?
[03:14.620 --> 03:15.920]  They're all based in Texas, right?
[03:16.180 --> 03:17.600]  Memphis Showboats, great name.
[03:18.020 --> 03:21.240]  Michigan Panthers, which sounds like a college team.
[03:21.560 --> 03:24.540]  I think it's all East Coast and Texas, mostly.
[03:24.780 --> 03:27.440]  And then there's a desert in California.
[03:27.440 --> 03:31.760]  Apparently next year, based on how well those are going to expand to California teams.
[03:31.920 --> 03:32.740]  Michigan Panthers?
[03:33.000 --> 03:33.400]  Uh-huh.
[03:33.680 --> 03:35.960]  I don't think there's a lot of Panthers in Michigan.
[03:36.980 --> 03:37.740]  I bet there are.
[03:37.800 --> 03:41.800]  There's probably not a lot of Lions either, but here we are looking at the values for our cards.
[03:42.460 --> 03:42.900]  Or Tigers.
[03:43.300 --> 03:44.320]  Not a lot of Tigers in Michigan.
[03:44.380 --> 03:45.200]  No, there's a bunch of Tigers.
[03:46.060 --> 03:47.760]  Last week, you remember, we got a bunch of cards.
[03:47.800 --> 03:48.040]  We did.
[03:48.280 --> 03:52.900]  I take the ones that look like the biggest hits and then I grade them and see how much money they're worth.
[03:52.980 --> 03:53.120]  Yep.
[03:53.380 --> 03:56.680]  Here we go, this sweet Jalen Williams rookie.
[03:56.680 --> 03:57.420]  How much do you think it is?
[03:57.420 --> 03:58.780]  This is a Disco Prism, I believe.
[04:00.680 --> 04:01.680]  Fast Break Prism.
[04:01.940 --> 04:02.460]  Six bucks.
[04:02.700 --> 04:02.960]  Under.
[04:03.760 --> 04:04.340]  Ten dollars.
[04:04.480 --> 04:04.880]  Wow.
[04:05.220 --> 04:09.180]  Here we have a Gunner Henderson Chrome 35th Anniversary rookie.
[04:09.480 --> 04:09.840]  Four bucks.
[04:10.960 --> 04:11.780]  Two dollars.
[04:12.080 --> 04:13.560]  You're bad at this.
[04:13.920 --> 04:15.220]  Same thing, Brett Beatty rookie.
[04:15.740 --> 04:16.700]  That's four bucks.
[04:17.940 --> 04:18.460]  Under.
[04:18.800 --> 04:19.220]  Five dollars.
[04:19.340 --> 04:20.440]  Oh, God!
[04:20.440 --> 04:25.880]  Next, we have a Bass Brawny from the McDonald's Tops All-American.
[04:26.180 --> 04:27.380]  Nine dollars.
[04:27.760 --> 04:28.020]  Over.
[04:28.680 --> 04:29.260]  Fifteen dollars.
[04:29.480 --> 04:29.940]  Wow!
[04:30.480 --> 04:33.500]  If you have this card, and you should sell it today.
[04:33.720 --> 04:35.160]  It's not going to be worth fifteen dollars in a month.
[04:35.180 --> 04:37.380]  We should sell some to see what happens.
[04:37.980 --> 04:38.160]  Okay.
[04:38.220 --> 04:39.980]  To see what do you think happens.
[04:40.400 --> 04:41.380]  Like, to see the process.
[04:41.640 --> 04:45.420]  Like, now we know about the PSA process.
[04:46.040 --> 04:46.360]  Yes.
[04:47.160 --> 04:48.760]  Just like we learned about PSA.
[04:49.960 --> 04:50.760]  Let's see what happens.
[04:50.840 --> 04:51.640]  Wow, money!
[04:51.920 --> 04:52.880]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:53.100 --> 04:53.820]  I like that.
[04:53.880 --> 04:54.400]  I like that, too.
[04:54.540 --> 04:56.800]  Here's this Obsidian we opened up last week.
[04:56.920 --> 04:59.460]  Zach Lathane numbered ten of ten.
[05:00.220 --> 05:00.860]  Very rare.
[05:01.500 --> 05:02.140]  Eleven dollars.
[05:02.220 --> 05:02.420]  Over.
[05:03.700 --> 05:04.340]  Fifteen dollars.
[05:04.540 --> 05:04.860]  Ooh!
[05:04.980 --> 05:05.340]  All right.
[05:05.640 --> 05:07.880]  I think you might be able to get a little bit more than that.
[05:07.920 --> 05:08.140]  Okay.
[05:08.600 --> 05:09.040]  Let's find out.
[05:09.160 --> 05:11.240]  Next, we have Game of Thrones Natalie Dormer.
[05:11.280 --> 05:11.580]  Twenty bucks.
[05:11.580 --> 05:13.600]  I think we all agree that she was the hottest woman in Game of Thrones.
[05:13.820 --> 05:14.440]  Twenty bucks.
[05:14.660 --> 05:15.660]  Gosh, she looks nothing like me.
[05:15.720 --> 05:16.000]  Got it.
[05:16.000 --> 05:16.480]  That's good.
[05:22.190 --> 05:22.970]  She died.
[05:24.570 --> 05:25.550]  What do you think, Emily?
[05:26.370 --> 05:27.530]  Eric said twenty bucks.
[05:27.650 --> 05:28.070]  Over.
[05:28.290 --> 05:28.450]  No.
[05:29.390 --> 05:30.570]  Over, under, I don't know.
[05:31.030 --> 05:31.750]  On the bot.
[05:31.890 --> 05:32.610]  One hundred dollars.
[05:32.650 --> 05:33.050]  Whoa!
[05:34.050 --> 05:34.630]  All right.
[05:34.710 --> 05:36.130]  Let's sell it, let's sell it.
[05:36.430 --> 05:37.090]  Let's see what happens.
[05:37.170 --> 05:39.970]  And then we have, of course, the crown jewel.
[05:40.090 --> 05:40.710]  Fifty bucks.
[05:40.950 --> 05:41.710]  Julian Caesar.
[05:43.170 --> 05:45.510]  This exact card has not sold yet this year.
[05:45.550 --> 05:45.670]  Yeah.
[05:45.670 --> 05:51.210]  But with the comps, I'm comfortable saying you could get anywhere between five hundred and a thousand dollars.
[05:51.570 --> 05:51.890]  Wow!
[05:53.730 --> 05:55.330]  I think five hundred is the floor.
[05:55.830 --> 05:57.150]  I think you could probably get a couple hundred.
[05:57.170 --> 05:59.590]  Gracie, are you excited to learn about the process of selling cards?
[06:02.170 --> 06:03.550]  I don't believe that's true.
[06:03.850 --> 06:05.670]  So, are we getting into pack sack and then a little bit of mail?
[06:05.770 --> 06:08.270]  We're just going to open up a pack sack pack and then we go straight into mail.
[06:08.430 --> 06:11.090]  Today's pack sack pack is going to be CFL football.
[06:11.090 --> 06:11.590]  Wait, wait, wait.
[06:11.650 --> 06:12.130]  Put that down.
[06:12.430 --> 06:13.630]  I want to see what that... is that me?
[06:14.050 --> 06:15.150]  Oh, that is you.
[06:15.150 --> 06:16.030]  Wow!
[06:16.450 --> 06:17.450]  He's like, number one!
[06:17.670 --> 06:18.170]  That's Jogo.
[06:18.170 --> 06:18.870]  That's Jogo!
[06:20.010 --> 06:21.210]  The CFL rat.
[06:21.630 --> 06:23.150]  Jogo the CFL rat!
[06:23.410 --> 06:23.970]  I guess.
[06:24.290 --> 06:26.510]  From 1991.
[06:27.330 --> 06:27.930]  Way to go, Joe.
[06:28.070 --> 06:29.610]  It's weird the CFL never caught on, huh?
[06:29.670 --> 06:32.310]  Who were your favorite CFL legends from 1991?
[06:33.010 --> 06:34.890]  Oh, from 91, it's a tough year.
[06:34.990 --> 06:37.390]  It's a thin year in the CFL for legends.
[06:37.550 --> 06:38.910]  How many CFL players can you name?
[06:38.950 --> 06:39.470]  I can name two.
[06:39.550 --> 06:39.750]  What's CFL?
[06:39.810 --> 06:40.530]  Canadian Football League.
[06:40.670 --> 06:43.430]  I think Ricky Williams and Doug Flutie.
[06:43.530 --> 06:44.230]  There you go.
[06:44.230 --> 06:45.050]  That's about right.
[06:45.050 --> 06:45.670]  Ricky Williams?
[06:45.850 --> 06:46.170]  Nuh-uh.
[06:46.730 --> 06:49.950]  After he washed out of the NFL, he ended up in the CFL for a while.
[06:50.610 --> 06:51.850]  They're like, you can't smoke weed.
[06:51.930 --> 06:52.810]  And he went, I'm going to Canada.
[06:52.970 --> 06:53.890]  And they went, oh, fine.
[06:54.030 --> 06:54.550]  Good for him.
[06:55.090 --> 06:55.450]  What do we got?
[06:56.410 --> 06:57.130]  Gerald Wilcox.
[06:57.150 --> 06:58.070]  Oh, that's a good one.
[06:58.930 --> 06:59.650]  Brent Madich.
[07:00.070 --> 07:01.070]  Oh, he got in the drop.
[07:01.370 --> 07:03.170]  And there he is, not catching the football.
[07:03.650 --> 07:04.010]  Wow.
[07:05.270 --> 07:05.970]  Save that one.
[07:06.250 --> 07:06.690]  Save that one.
[07:07.130 --> 07:09.710]  He doesn't understand the sport he's in.
[07:10.370 --> 07:11.090]  David Williams.
[07:11.190 --> 07:12.950]  I don't think Eskimos is probably a team anymore.
[07:12.950 --> 07:14.410]  Probably not.
[07:14.790 --> 07:15.270]  Yeah.
[07:15.750 --> 07:17.250]  Danny Barrett.
[07:17.390 --> 07:20.030]  Stan Peters probably isn't a team anymore either, because of Ultimat.
[07:21.330 --> 07:22.190]  Way to go, man.
[07:22.370 --> 07:22.650]  Wow.
[07:23.210 --> 07:23.530]  All right.
[07:23.790 --> 07:23.970]  Deep.
[07:25.190 --> 07:26.790]  You were so pleased with that.
[07:27.030 --> 07:28.570]  Whoa, Tiger Cats.
[07:29.450 --> 07:29.930]  That's...
[07:29.930 --> 07:30.890]  Tigers are cats.
[07:31.030 --> 07:31.330]  That's stupid.
[07:31.570 --> 07:32.930]  That's like food food.
[07:35.570 --> 07:36.530]  Kelvin Prunster.
[07:37.150 --> 07:37.750]  He loves prunes.
[07:37.990 --> 07:38.050]  Argonauts.
[07:38.070 --> 07:38.950]  That's my team right there.
[07:40.870 --> 07:43.510]  Steve Radahutskers for the Blue Bombers.
[07:43.810 --> 07:43.950]  Great.
[07:44.870 --> 07:46.630]  Ken Padaway for the Lions.
[07:47.070 --> 07:47.290]  Ooh, the Lions.
[07:47.790 --> 07:51.070]  Can the Lions win the Gray Cup next season?
[07:52.730 --> 07:53.750]  Tune in to find out.
[07:53.770 --> 07:54.410]  Richie Hall.
[07:54.650 --> 07:55.490]  He's a rough rider.
[07:55.590 --> 07:56.070]  Yeah, baby.
[07:56.390 --> 07:56.610]  Stop, stop.
[07:57.210 --> 07:57.630]  Shut him down.
[07:58.270 --> 07:58.650]  Open up.
[07:59.590 --> 08:02.450]  Gerald Baylis for the Lions as well.
[08:02.570 --> 08:02.790]  Nice.
[08:03.170 --> 08:03.850]  There you go.
[08:03.930 --> 08:07.730]  Some of the stars of 1991's Canadian professional football.
[08:07.730 --> 08:08.890]  The stars.
[08:09.710 --> 08:10.150]  There they are.
[08:10.250 --> 08:11.390]  The Prunster and the gang.
[08:11.730 --> 08:12.210]  Let's do some mail.
[08:12.330 --> 08:13.110]  Okay, what do you want to get into?
[08:13.430 --> 08:13.870]  Let's see.
[08:13.950 --> 08:14.710]  What's this first?
[08:16.210 --> 08:16.670]  There you go.
[08:17.050 --> 08:18.370]  And then you can just ditch that box.
[08:18.650 --> 08:19.130]  There you go.
[08:20.910 --> 08:21.890]  Fine to read aloud.
[08:22.010 --> 08:22.230]  Thank you.
[08:22.290 --> 08:24.350]  Always let me know if you don't want me to read it on there.
[08:24.470 --> 08:25.550]  Because I'm going to assume I can.
[08:25.950 --> 08:27.030]  I've been a big fan...
[08:27.030 --> 08:27.430]  Hi, Geoff.
[08:27.530 --> 08:29.210]  I've been a big fan of your work for many years.
[08:29.250 --> 08:29.850]  Oh, thank you.
[08:30.050 --> 08:32.170]  And felt compelled to get this for you when I saw it.
[08:32.270 --> 08:33.210]  Congrats to you and Emily.
[08:33.470 --> 08:34.050]  Best wishes.
[08:34.230 --> 08:36.570]  And many thanks for all that you do and all that you have done.
[08:36.570 --> 08:37.590]  Taylor S.
[08:37.890 --> 08:38.170]  He, him.
[08:38.270 --> 08:38.910]  Thank you, Taylor.
[08:39.750 --> 08:40.750]  And what is this?
[08:40.990 --> 08:41.550]  Oh, shit!
[08:45.180 --> 08:46.120]  It's a fucking...
[08:46.120 --> 08:46.540]  It's awesome.
[08:46.720 --> 08:47.820]  Oh, that's it.
[08:47.820 --> 08:48.000]  Oh, wow!
[08:48.620 --> 08:50.680]  This could not have come at a better time for me.
[08:50.760 --> 08:52.400]  That's like a warm fabric, too.
[08:52.580 --> 08:52.780]  What the fuck?
[08:52.880 --> 08:55.600]  I forgot to tell you one component.
[08:55.740 --> 08:57.240]  There's a story I can't tell on air.
[08:57.520 --> 08:59.900]  But I told Eric in the car this morning.
[09:00.100 --> 09:00.860]  You know the story.
[09:00.860 --> 09:01.640]  I lived it.
[09:01.900 --> 09:04.780]  And I forgot to tell you that when I got back to the hotel,
[09:04.840 --> 09:06.500]  I'm explaining this story to Emily.
[09:07.280 --> 09:08.300]  It's NBA related.
[09:08.300 --> 09:09.620]  I was explaining this story.
[09:09.660 --> 09:10.340]  I was trying to fit in.
[09:10.700 --> 09:11.460]  And Emily goes,
[09:11.540 --> 09:13.580]  do you think they might have looked at you weird
[09:13.580 --> 09:16.000]  because you were wearing an NBA Summer League hat the whole time?
[09:16.640 --> 09:18.480]  I was thinking the same thing.
[09:18.560 --> 09:19.340]  Didn't say anything.
[09:19.760 --> 09:20.840]  But they're like, this dork.
[09:20.880 --> 09:21.380]  Yeah, absolutely.
[09:23.420 --> 09:24.500]  You can adjust it.
[09:24.500 --> 09:25.320]  I'm going to adjust it.
[09:25.400 --> 09:25.660]  Jesus.
[09:26.420 --> 09:27.640]  While you're adjusting that,
[09:27.720 --> 09:28.600]  that's awesome, by the way.
[09:28.740 --> 09:29.160]  That's so cool.
[09:29.180 --> 09:30.560]  It's like a good winter hat, too.
[09:30.600 --> 09:31.420]  It's all cozy.
[09:31.960 --> 09:34.760]  Now, this is one I'm very excited about.
[09:34.920 --> 09:37.160]  Again, we've been getting mail from you guys.
[09:37.200 --> 09:37.960]  We really appreciate it.
[09:37.960 --> 09:39.940]  1901 East 51st Street, Austin, Texas.
[09:40.700 --> 09:41.020]  78723.
[09:41.440 --> 09:42.760]  You can send that to...
[09:42.760 --> 09:43.120]  Care of the Break Show.
[09:43.120 --> 09:43.800]  Care of the Break Show.
[09:44.080 --> 09:45.380]  And then we get it, put it all together.
[09:45.700 --> 09:46.880]  Again, this is only some of the mail,
[09:47.060 --> 09:48.180]  but I want to read this one for you.
[09:48.900 --> 09:49.460]  Hey, fuckers.
[09:49.720 --> 09:50.020]  Emily.
[09:50.480 --> 09:50.760]  Hey.
[09:51.260 --> 09:53.300]  First off, congratulations to the newlyweds.
[09:53.420 --> 09:53.720]  Thank you.
[09:53.740 --> 09:54.360]  We just got married.
[09:55.360 --> 09:55.540]  We did it.
[09:55.600 --> 09:57.960]  Listening to Fuckface is the highlight of my week,
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.360]  and I'm so excited to have almost daily content now.
[10:00.400 --> 10:00.660]  It's true.
[10:00.720 --> 10:01.920]  We have something coming out almost every day.
[10:02.480 --> 10:03.420]  I love Fuckface often.
[10:03.500 --> 10:04.560]  I can't wait for the next season.
[10:04.860 --> 10:05.860]  After the first episode,
[10:05.860 --> 10:08.740]  I have the idea to make baseball cards for the teams.
[10:08.920 --> 10:12.160]  So I kept track of the stats and designed the card.
[10:12.520 --> 10:15.460]  There's a card for every player that played,
[10:15.640 --> 10:17.600]  even if they didn't get an at-bat.
[10:17.860 --> 10:18.080]  Whoa.
[10:18.300 --> 10:21.680]  Each card has the actual stats for each player throughout the season.
[10:22.180 --> 10:24.180]  It's the first time I've done something like this,
[10:24.200 --> 10:26.160]  and I'm really happy with how the cards turned out.
[10:26.320 --> 10:27.340]  And I hope you guys like them.
[10:27.460 --> 10:28.780]  Thanks for all the laughs and the inspiration.
[10:29.220 --> 10:30.260]  Tyler C.
[10:31.520 --> 10:32.340]  Oh, my God.
[10:32.400 --> 10:35.560]  The Taylors and the Tylers today are really killing it.
[10:37.260 --> 10:38.820]  Taylor, thank you. Tyler.
[10:39.140 --> 10:39.540]  Wow.
[10:39.820 --> 10:40.700]  There you go.
[10:41.300 --> 10:43.000]  So if you don't know what he's talking about,
[10:43.040 --> 10:46.760]  we just recently did a first-only show for Fuckface
[10:48.260 --> 10:50.980]  called Fuckface Off, where we simulated...
[10:50.980 --> 10:51.560]  Oh, my God.
[10:51.720 --> 10:53.460]  We created our own professional sports teams
[10:53.460 --> 10:57.260]  and then simulated them playing and had a season of baseball
[10:57.260 --> 11:00.000]  and had a winner, which I don't want to spoil.
[11:00.060 --> 11:00.780]  We won't spoil it.
[11:00.860 --> 11:01.400]  We won't spoil it.
[11:01.400 --> 11:05.000]  And so this Tyler, this genius Tyler,
[11:06.280 --> 11:07.820]  made cards for every player.
[11:07.880 --> 11:08.720]  There's 27 players.
[11:08.760 --> 11:10.620]  Yeah, we're not going to go through all of them here
[11:10.620 --> 11:13.000]  because I think we're going to hang on to these and display them for us.
[11:13.080 --> 11:14.040]  But, dude, check these out.
[11:14.140 --> 11:14.940]  Jock Ewing.
[11:15.160 --> 11:15.900]  Oh, hell yeah.
[11:15.900 --> 11:16.800]  Look at these cards.
[11:16.800 --> 11:17.480]  I am Takata.
[11:17.900 --> 11:19.040]  I am Takapa.
[11:20.120 --> 11:21.320]  Lefty Not Right.
[11:22.640 --> 11:23.840]  So these are all one of ones.
[11:24.800 --> 11:25.600]  Pants Podgana.
[11:25.800 --> 11:26.740]  Oh, my God.
[11:26.860 --> 11:27.860]  There's J.R. Ewing.
[11:28.120 --> 11:28.820]  Hey, man.
[11:28.920 --> 11:29.780]  He wished he looked like this.
[11:30.080 --> 11:30.480]  Man.
[11:30.480 --> 11:31.500]  Johnna Culver.
[11:31.680 --> 11:32.040]  Oh, yeah.
[11:32.140 --> 11:32.700]  She made Ray.
[11:32.920 --> 11:34.400]  Hidden Valley Secret.
[11:34.740 --> 11:35.940]  Oh, my God.
[11:36.240 --> 11:37.560]  Kent Kiore.
[11:37.580 --> 11:39.680]  No, show the back of some of these cards.
[11:40.200 --> 11:41.280]  Here's Gary Ewing.
[11:41.660 --> 11:42.340]  Oh, my God.
[11:42.700 --> 11:43.060]  Gary.
[11:44.560 --> 11:45.780]  So on the back...
[11:45.780 --> 11:46.060]  Oh, wait.
[11:46.140 --> 11:46.860]  Here, that's Biff Dingle.
[11:47.000 --> 11:47.140]  Hold on.
[11:47.280 --> 11:48.240]  Let's look at Biff Dingle.
[11:48.300 --> 11:49.320]  Here's Biff Dingle.
[11:49.460 --> 11:50.580]  He was on Gavin's team, I believe.
[11:50.700 --> 11:51.520]  Oh, my God.
[11:51.560 --> 11:53.540]  And on the back, the stats.
[11:53.780 --> 11:54.660]  Left field, outfield.
[11:54.840 --> 11:55.620]  He played for the Pencils.
[11:55.640 --> 11:56.240]  Bats left.
[11:56.480 --> 11:57.800]  Traits off-speed hitter.
[11:58.080 --> 11:59.940]  Known for his hypnotic batting stance.
[11:59.940 --> 12:01.260]  He shakes that thing.
[12:01.760 --> 12:02.500]  Two games played.
[12:02.620 --> 12:03.380]  Seven at bats.
[12:03.520 --> 12:04.060]  Zero runs.
[12:04.160 --> 12:04.560]  Two hits.
[12:04.660 --> 12:05.120]  One RBI.
[12:05.580 --> 12:06.140]  One double.
[12:06.220 --> 12:06.640]  No triples.
[12:06.720 --> 12:07.120]  No homers.
[12:07.180 --> 12:07.900]  No base on ball.
[12:08.180 --> 12:08.860]  Three strikeouts.
[12:09.260 --> 12:10.300]  286 average.
[12:10.440 --> 12:12.500]  These are fucking awesome.
[12:13.100 --> 12:14.940]  These are so cool...
[12:15.460 --> 12:15.820]  Dang.
[12:16.120 --> 12:18.840]  ...that somebody made actual baseball cards for our team.
[12:19.900 --> 12:20.720]  Check it out.
[12:20.820 --> 12:21.600]  There's manager cards.
[12:21.680 --> 12:22.560]  There's manager cards.
[12:22.860 --> 12:23.080]  Oh, wait.
[12:23.120 --> 12:23.760]  What's on the back?
[12:24.440 --> 12:25.380]  Gavin Free.
[12:25.480 --> 12:27.840]  Born 5-23, Oxfordshire.
[12:27.980 --> 12:29.140]  20-23.
[12:29.740 --> 12:30.540]  Managerial record.
[12:30.720 --> 12:30.880]  Won.
[12:31.420 --> 12:31.820]  Pennsylvania.
[12:32.160 --> 12:32.600]  That's his team.
[12:32.760 --> 12:33.860]  The Pennsylvania Pencils.
[12:34.760 --> 12:35.400]  It's got his team.
[12:35.400 --> 12:37.140]  Oh, and then it gives some of the rundowns.
[12:37.320 --> 12:37.500]  Wow.
[12:38.920 --> 12:39.620]  Dude, these are so cool.
[12:39.620 --> 12:40.200]  They're Shirley Miscavige.
[12:40.420 --> 12:41.560]  That is so cool.
[12:41.620 --> 12:42.340]  Dude, thank you, Tyler.
[12:42.440 --> 12:42.980]  These are awesome.
[12:42.980 --> 12:43.760]  That is amazing.
[12:43.900 --> 12:45.120]  There's Slow Mo Guys.
[12:45.940 --> 12:46.420]  Oh, my God.
[12:46.800 --> 12:48.340]  Subscribe to Slow Mo Guys.
[12:48.440 --> 12:49.220]  There's Bobby Ewing.
[12:49.780 --> 12:50.360]  Oh, these are so great.
[12:50.360 --> 12:51.580]  That does look like Bobby, though.
[12:52.620 --> 12:54.780]  There's Andrew's Jacques de Gatineau.
[12:57.340 --> 12:58.380]  Chad Undergunt.
[12:58.580 --> 12:59.300]  Oh, man.
[12:59.400 --> 12:59.700]  Wow.
[13:00.040 --> 13:01.420]  Andrew Panton, manager card.
[13:02.120 --> 13:02.320]  That's good.
[13:02.920 --> 13:05.740]  Ronald Geronaldson, R.C. Rotta.
[13:06.180 --> 13:06.980]  That's amazing.
[13:07.180 --> 13:08.140]  Angela Lansbury.
[13:08.740 --> 13:09.500]  That face.
[13:09.740 --> 13:10.640]  Oh, my God.
[13:11.180 --> 13:12.380]  Oh, my God.
[13:12.500 --> 13:13.460]  These are so cool.
[13:13.480 --> 13:14.460]  This is so... well, Salted Caramel.
[13:14.600 --> 13:14.820]  Mm-hmm.
[13:18.900 --> 13:20.780]  Here's Gregorio Ivanovich.
[13:22.400 --> 13:23.520]  Oh, my God.
[13:23.680 --> 13:24.180]  There's Afton.
[13:24.180 --> 13:27.560]  These have been... these are so... these are great.
[13:27.900 --> 13:28.600]  These are so great.
[13:29.120 --> 13:30.320]  Thank you so much, Tyler.
[13:30.700 --> 13:30.980]  Tyler.
[13:31.380 --> 13:31.540]  Yep.
[13:31.740 --> 13:33.500]  So he did it for the teams.
[13:33.660 --> 13:34.640]  And there's more there.
[13:34.820 --> 13:36.060]  And it's just really awesome.
[13:36.380 --> 13:37.420]  We really, really appreciate that.
[13:37.500 --> 13:38.300]  Thank you so much for watching.
[13:38.400 --> 13:39.260]  Thank you for making these.
[13:39.740 --> 13:42.680]  These are going to be cherished possessions here for Fuckface.
[13:42.760 --> 13:44.180]  I don't know how we...
[13:44.820 --> 13:46.180]  Should we just put them in sleeves?
[13:47.080 --> 13:47.940]  How to display these.
[13:48.040 --> 13:48.300]  I don't know.
[13:48.360 --> 13:49.540]  We're gonna have to figure it out.
[13:49.580 --> 13:51.720]  But we gotta make sure we hang on to them and nothing happens to them.
[13:51.740 --> 13:52.980]  Because these are really cool.
[13:52.980 --> 13:54.500]  Do you want me to put them in my little briefcase?
[13:54.560 --> 13:59.280]  These are up here with our non-regulation Gerplers, amongst my favorite things.
[13:59.760 --> 14:02.860]  And then the stuff that the twins... the pictures of the twins...
[14:02.960 --> 14:03.580]  And the easels.
[14:04.200 --> 14:04.580]  Here, let me give you...
[14:04.580 --> 14:06.040]  And our card that Hayley made.
[14:06.380 --> 14:06.720]  Oh, right.
[14:06.780 --> 14:07.360]  Oh, very nice.
[14:07.460 --> 14:08.680]  Keep them safe, please.
[14:09.000 --> 14:09.960]  Thank you.
[14:10.320 --> 14:11.800]  Here's some cards somebody sent in.
[14:11.840 --> 14:13.220]  They didn't send us a note.
[14:13.740 --> 14:16.240]  But they sent us Star Wars Avengers of the Sith, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,
[14:16.320 --> 14:18.100]  second series, Ultimate Battles,
[14:19.020 --> 14:20.420]  Pirates at Ocean's Edge,
[14:20.740 --> 14:20.820]  Okay.
[14:21.240 --> 14:22.220]  Lord of the Rings,
[14:22.220 --> 14:23.200]  and Captain America.
[14:23.300 --> 14:24.480]  I say we open up Lord of the Rings.
[14:24.620 --> 14:24.780]  Okay.
[14:24.920 --> 14:25.680]  Can we open Ninja Turtles?
[14:26.160 --> 14:26.900]  And Ninja Turtles.
[14:26.980 --> 14:28.160]  Let's put Ultimate Battles.
[14:28.480 --> 14:29.540]  Because we've got to feed the pack sack.
[14:29.660 --> 14:29.800]  Yeah.
[14:29.880 --> 14:30.500]  Put that in the pack sack.
[14:30.560 --> 14:30.720]  Cool.
[14:31.020 --> 14:31.200]  Alright.
[14:32.280 --> 14:32.800]  TMNT, here we go.
[14:32.800 --> 14:33.900]  Let's see what these turtles are up to.
[14:33.920 --> 14:35.460]  I don't know if we've ever opened TMNT cards.
[14:36.680 --> 14:37.600]  Did you see the new one?
[14:37.880 --> 14:38.120]  Yeah.
[14:38.460 --> 14:38.880]  Do you like it?
[14:39.060 --> 14:39.460]  Loved it.
[14:39.600 --> 14:40.240]  It's so fun.
[14:40.320 --> 14:41.080]  I loved it.
[14:41.100 --> 14:42.080]  I loved it when they were babies.
[14:44.600 --> 14:45.680]  Bebop and Rocksteady.
[14:45.760 --> 14:46.740]  That's a sticker, I believe.
[14:47.240 --> 14:48.860]  Here we have Saving Michelangelo.
[14:48.960 --> 14:49.340]  There they are.
[14:49.380 --> 14:50.240]  They're saving Michelangelo.
[14:50.240 --> 14:52.400]  Will the fly flee?
[14:53.040 --> 14:53.640]  Do we have...
[14:53.640 --> 14:55.040]  What's the other artist that we have?
[14:55.400 --> 14:55.900]  Da Vinci?
[14:56.880 --> 14:57.660]  Saved by Science.
[14:57.760 --> 15:00.160]  We have Julius Caesar, but then we got...
[15:00.160 --> 15:02.620]  We got Da Vinci and...
[15:02.620 --> 15:03.840]  I thought we got like a Michelangelo.
[15:04.560 --> 15:05.500]  Michelangelo, Rembrandt, maybe?
[15:05.740 --> 15:07.320]  Do you think we can get all the Ninja Turtles?
[15:07.840 --> 15:08.960]  Oh, that's a great idea.
[15:09.200 --> 15:09.680]  We should try to collect...
[15:09.680 --> 15:10.900]  I also don't know where those are.
[15:11.220 --> 15:12.060]  I need to find those cards.
[15:12.400 --> 15:13.460]  I know they're in here somewhere, but...
[15:13.460 --> 15:13.660]  Great.
[15:13.840 --> 15:14.900]  It's getting messy in here.
[15:15.220 --> 15:16.300]  Lord of the Rings.
[15:16.420 --> 15:16.840]  Let's do it.
[15:16.840 --> 15:17.980]  We need like a...
[15:17.980 --> 15:19.040]  One of those big...
[15:19.040 --> 15:19.780]  Like a...
[15:20.760 --> 15:21.120]  Library...
[15:21.120 --> 15:22.160]  Card things.
[15:22.280 --> 15:23.600]  These little motherfuckers are tiny.
[15:24.080 --> 15:24.260]  What?
[15:24.440 --> 15:24.980]  Oh, they're lenticular.
[15:25.160 --> 15:25.780]  Cave troll.
[15:26.060 --> 15:26.380]  Oh, little.
[15:26.620 --> 15:27.000]  Yeah, nice.
[15:27.640 --> 15:28.480]  There's the cave troll.
[15:28.760 --> 15:29.100]  That's me.
[15:29.140 --> 15:29.820]  As you can see on the switch.
[15:32.620 --> 15:34.480]  There's just a piece of the ring.
[15:35.540 --> 15:37.180]  A sticker of hobbits.
[15:37.520 --> 15:38.080]  What was the...
[15:38.080 --> 15:39.100]  I'm sorry, I didn't see it.
[15:39.100 --> 15:40.000]  But what's the deal with the ring?
[15:40.760 --> 15:42.660]  Oh, there's one ring to rule them all, Emily.
[15:42.740 --> 15:44.220]  So you're just like in charge of the world?
[15:44.380 --> 15:44.700]  Well, yeah.
[15:44.800 --> 15:45.840]  Well, what happens...
[15:45.840 --> 15:46.840]  You have powers?
[15:46.840 --> 15:46.960]  You have power.
[15:47.100 --> 15:52.380]  What happened is that these rings were created and then they were destroyed for they gave
[15:52.380 --> 15:56.620]  too much power, but they were all of them deceived for another ring was made.
[15:57.900 --> 15:58.700]  He knows a lot.
[15:58.800 --> 15:59.360]  So that ring wasn't even...
[15:59.360 --> 15:59.780]  No, that's all I know.
[15:59.880 --> 16:01.320]  That's the only thing I know about it.
[16:01.360 --> 16:02.160]  I don't like Lord of the Rings.
[16:02.700 --> 16:03.020]  Yeah.
[16:03.300 --> 16:04.700]  Someone else sent these in.
[16:04.700 --> 16:04.900]  Okay.
[16:05.380 --> 16:06.020]  We got these...
[16:06.020 --> 16:08.140]  I don't know what these court side things are, so we'll open one of those.
[16:08.140 --> 16:08.300]  Okay.
[16:08.460 --> 16:09.300]  Then we got...
[16:09.300 --> 16:10.000]  This will be cool.
[16:10.160 --> 16:11.200]  Nolan and Ryan, but we'll open it later.
[16:11.200 --> 16:11.420]  Oh, wow.
[16:11.480 --> 16:11.960]  That looks exciting.
[16:11.960 --> 16:14.020]  How about some American pride?
[16:14.020 --> 16:15.420]  Definitely open up one of those.
[16:15.540 --> 16:15.920]  That's Geoff right there.
[16:16.160 --> 16:16.760]  Michigan State.
[16:16.960 --> 16:17.540]  Oh, Santa.
[16:17.980 --> 16:18.460]  There we go.
[16:18.500 --> 16:18.920]  Oh, Christmas.
[16:18.920 --> 16:19.800]  And then a bunch of other...
[16:19.800 --> 16:20.620]  There's so much stuff here.
[16:20.620 --> 16:21.360]  There's a lot of cool packs.
[16:21.580 --> 16:21.820]  Okay.
[16:22.160 --> 16:22.500]  So let's...
[16:22.500 --> 16:23.300]  We'll hang on to some of these.
[16:23.380 --> 16:24.080]  Some will go in the pack sack.
[16:24.080 --> 16:24.960]  Let's see what the court side is.
[16:25.020 --> 16:25.740]  I want to see what court side is.
[16:25.760 --> 16:25.960]  All right.
[16:26.040 --> 16:26.480]  Court side.
[16:26.560 --> 16:26.840]  It says...
[16:26.840 --> 16:27.500]  Because if it's cool, there's more.
[16:27.580 --> 16:29.160]  Limited edition three card hologram set.
[16:29.220 --> 16:30.260]  99,000 sets produced.
[16:30.360 --> 16:31.360]  This has not been opened.
[16:31.680 --> 16:31.880]  Oh.
[16:31.980 --> 16:32.980]  Does it say what year or anything?
[16:33.140 --> 16:33.400]  No.
[16:33.520 --> 16:34.600]  Have you ever heard of it?
[16:34.640 --> 16:34.900]  No.
[16:35.120 --> 16:36.240]  I don't know what court side is.
[16:36.240 --> 16:37.000]  Court side TM.
[16:37.200 --> 16:38.200]  Card is made in the USA.
[16:38.700 --> 16:39.180]  All right.
[16:39.460 --> 16:39.860]  Nice.
[16:40.260 --> 16:41.720]  This one has a name on it.
[16:42.540 --> 16:43.220]  Russell White.
[16:43.500 --> 16:43.980]  There he is.
[16:44.200 --> 16:44.360]  Who's that?
[16:44.500 --> 16:44.680]  All right.
[16:44.720 --> 16:45.120]  What do we got?
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.100]  This card we have...
[16:48.100 --> 16:48.760]  Mark Makin.
[16:49.280 --> 16:50.820]  First round draft pick.
[16:50.900 --> 16:51.900]  There's more cards behind it, no?
[16:52.520 --> 16:53.020]  Uh, yeah.
[16:53.500 --> 16:54.240]  Oh, shit.
[16:54.700 --> 16:55.240]  They're already sleeping.
[16:55.280 --> 16:55.980]  We have...
[16:55.980 --> 16:56.160]  Oh!
[16:56.380 --> 16:57.200]  We have Greg Anthony.
[16:57.940 --> 16:58.340]  1990...
[16:58.960 --> 16:59.520]  UNLV champion.
[16:59.520 --> 17:00.400]  It's UNLV?
[17:00.640 --> 17:01.920]  And then Larry Johnson.
[17:02.040 --> 17:02.880]  1990 player of the year.
[17:03.040 --> 17:03.300]  Okay.
[17:03.300 --> 17:03.840]  Wow.
[17:03.840 --> 17:04.660]  So are these college?
[17:05.500 --> 17:05.940]  Yeah.
[17:06.100 --> 17:07.580]  These are them in college.
[17:07.720 --> 17:08.320]  Because there's...
[17:08.320 --> 17:08.480]  Huh.
[17:08.780 --> 17:10.440]  Larry Johnson's in his Rebels.
[17:11.900 --> 17:12.780]  There's UNLV.
[17:12.820 --> 17:13.060]  Yeah.
[17:13.220 --> 17:13.660]  Interesting.
[17:14.120 --> 17:14.720]  I've never...
[17:14.720 --> 17:18.440]  I've never seen or heard of these before.
[17:18.620 --> 17:19.000]  How strange.
[17:19.300 --> 17:20.740]  Did Michael Jordan go to college?
[17:21.200 --> 17:21.400]  Yeah.
[17:21.620 --> 17:22.420]  He was at Tar Heel.
[17:22.640 --> 17:23.480]  Yeah, he went to Tar Heel.
[17:23.660 --> 17:25.980]  What if there's one of his in here?
[17:26.780 --> 17:27.320]  What if?
[17:27.940 --> 17:28.640]  What if?
[17:28.660 --> 17:30.780]  I mean, probably the years don't line up, but maybe.
[17:31.100 --> 17:32.460]  Kobe didn't go to college.
[17:32.460 --> 17:33.860]  No, he was straight A.
[17:33.900 --> 17:36.200]  Who would have been in college in the early 90s?
[17:36.240 --> 17:36.600]  A lot of people.
[17:36.980 --> 17:37.840]  Yeah, a lot of people.
[17:37.940 --> 17:38.180]  Definitely.
[17:38.320 --> 17:39.080]  Every day are in college.
[17:39.220 --> 17:41.740]  But like, that were big in the NBA.
[17:42.100 --> 17:42.480]  She loves me.
[17:43.240 --> 17:43.940]  She loves me a lot.
[17:43.940 --> 17:45.920]  Yeah, a lot of fucking people were in college, man.
[17:46.080 --> 17:46.280]  Yeah.
[17:46.380 --> 17:46.660]  Great.
[17:46.900 --> 17:47.060]  Cool.
[17:47.280 --> 17:48.080]  But like...
[17:48.080 --> 17:48.300]  Yeah.
[17:49.040 --> 17:49.400]  Jack.
[17:50.440 --> 17:50.600]  Yeah.
[17:50.780 --> 17:51.040]  Okay.
[17:51.200 --> 17:51.480]  What if there's like...
[17:51.480 --> 17:52.440]  Tim Hardaway.
[17:52.580 --> 17:52.880]  Okay.
[17:53.660 --> 17:54.160]  Tim Hardaway.
[17:54.280 --> 17:55.060]  There's some answers.
[17:55.560 --> 17:56.280]  We're getting there.
[17:57.520 --> 17:58.440]  I love you.
[17:58.460 --> 17:58.820]  Angel.
[17:59.540 --> 18:00.760]  The people's princess.
[18:01.080 --> 18:02.000]  A, the Southwest.
[18:02.940 --> 18:03.380]  A.
[18:03.680 --> 18:03.880]  Yep.
[18:04.120 --> 18:05.840]  Not to be outdone by the West.
[18:06.080 --> 18:06.340]  Yeah!
[18:07.760 --> 18:09.980]  A, what's more American than baseball?
[18:10.460 --> 18:11.240]  A, hot dog.
[18:11.360 --> 18:11.900]  Dodger dogs.
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.040]  The hot dog in it is great.
[18:14.200 --> 18:14.440]  Yeah.
[18:15.080 --> 18:16.200]  Hey, what's baseball?
[18:16.400 --> 18:16.720]  Glove?
[18:16.840 --> 18:17.400]  Fuck you.
[18:17.440 --> 18:17.920]  Hot dog.
[18:18.120 --> 18:19.260]  No, it's a bat knob.
[18:19.360 --> 18:20.380]  The hot dog's definitely the star.
[18:20.380 --> 18:22.260]  This is actually a very fuck face.
[18:22.500 --> 18:22.800]  It is.
[18:22.800 --> 18:25.840]  The hot dog, the ball, and the bat knob.
[18:25.920 --> 18:26.120]  Yep.
[18:26.120 --> 18:29.000]  You don't have American pride if you don't love stars.
[18:29.220 --> 18:29.620]  It's true.
[18:29.980 --> 18:30.320]  Okay.
[18:30.400 --> 18:32.280]  I love fucking stars, dude.
[18:32.380 --> 18:33.300]  You know who loved stars?
[18:33.420 --> 18:33.780]  Who's that?
[18:33.900 --> 18:35.360]  The bad guy in Resident Evil 3.
[18:35.940 --> 18:37.060]  He would go around going, stars!
[18:37.560 --> 18:38.760]  Well, I think he hated stars.
[18:38.960 --> 18:39.520]  He hated stars.
[18:39.620 --> 18:39.720]  Yeah.
[18:39.880 --> 18:40.580]  He loved them so much he hated them.
[18:40.620 --> 18:41.220]  U.S. Constitution.
[18:41.980 --> 18:42.520]  We the people.
[18:42.800 --> 18:43.180]  They are.
[18:43.460 --> 18:44.680]  We don't change it at all.
[18:44.940 --> 18:45.240]  Never.
[18:45.460 --> 18:46.120]  No, we keep...
[18:46.120 --> 18:46.520]  No amendments.
[18:46.740 --> 18:47.560]  We keep...
[18:47.560 --> 18:49.780]  It's a dead document, as they say.
[18:49.860 --> 18:50.960]  It's a living document.
[18:51.340 --> 18:52.020]  Oh, yeah, we should make some changes.
[18:52.020 --> 18:52.560]  It's an unliving document.
[18:53.240 --> 18:53.960]  Fuck you.
[18:54.380 --> 18:54.740]  Santa.
[18:54.740 --> 18:55.500]  Santa.
[18:55.600 --> 18:56.340]  Santa around the world.
[18:56.700 --> 18:56.900]  Aw.
[18:57.200 --> 18:57.880]  Santa Claus.
[18:58.200 --> 18:58.880]  We have...
[18:58.880 --> 19:03.860]  If you like Santa, you should check out our Christmas movie draft that just came out and
[19:03.860 --> 19:06.800]  our Christmas music draft that comes out this Saturday.
[19:06.900 --> 19:07.480]  Oh, that's a great point.
[19:07.480 --> 19:11.420]  And also listen to my podcast, So All Right, because I saw the numbers today and I need
[19:11.420 --> 19:12.160]  you to listen to it.
[19:12.800 --> 19:13.200]  Also...
[19:13.200 --> 19:13.800]  You can do it with Christmas.
[19:14.080 --> 19:17.440]  Also listen to Clutch My Pearls because the episode that comes out tomorrow is...
[19:17.440 --> 19:20.100]  It's about Santa, but if you have dyslexia, it might be about Satan.
[19:20.720 --> 19:22.560]  Oh, it's like where the devil bangs the lady, huh?
[19:22.780 --> 19:23.180]  Satan.
[19:23.180 --> 19:23.680]  At Christmas.
[19:23.780 --> 19:24.620]  My wife had nightmares.
[19:24.820 --> 19:27.160]  Father Christmas from England.
[19:27.600 --> 19:30.580]  That's what Gavin thinks Santa Claus looks like.
[19:30.580 --> 19:31.420]  He brings grapes.
[19:31.860 --> 19:32.460]  He brings grapes.
[19:32.460 --> 19:33.800]  With his Christmas wreath around his head.
[19:33.880 --> 19:39.140]  He's like the guy in the Muppets when he shows up and he does a song.
[19:39.500 --> 19:40.160]  The third one.
[19:40.760 --> 19:41.220]  Oh, yeah.
[19:41.220 --> 19:41.920]  The Muppet Christmas Carol.
[19:42.120 --> 19:42.400]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:43.180 --> 19:44.540]  Santa around the world collection.
[19:44.780 --> 19:45.120]  There he is.
[19:45.120 --> 19:45.980]  It's just a picture of shit.
[19:46.280 --> 19:46.920]  I've got all these cards.
[19:47.320 --> 19:48.140]  1909, Norway.
[19:48.440 --> 19:48.660]  That's what he looks like.
[19:48.760 --> 19:49.160]  Wow.
[19:49.820 --> 19:50.980]  Had a tree growing out of his back.
[19:51.140 --> 19:51.540]  That's cool.
[19:52.700 --> 19:53.900]  You'll recognize this.
[19:54.860 --> 19:55.820]  1951, USA.
[19:56.560 --> 19:57.820]  That's a good Santa.
[19:58.040 --> 19:58.760]  It's like a little mouse.
[19:59.140 --> 20:00.600]  Yeah, I think it's a little Christmas mouse.
[20:01.380 --> 20:02.400]  1930, Switzerland.
[20:02.860 --> 20:03.400]  That's a good one.
[20:03.440 --> 20:03.840]  Looks like Santa.
[20:05.120 --> 20:06.100]  He's like underlit.
[20:06.220 --> 20:06.780]  That's awesome.
[20:07.060 --> 20:07.340]  Dude.
[20:07.520 --> 20:08.560]  1900, Europe.
[20:08.680 --> 20:10.360]  Santa looks like a fucking badass.
[20:10.400 --> 20:10.840]  That's cool.
[20:11.320 --> 20:12.140]  He's out there.
[20:12.640 --> 20:13.140]  He's trudging.
[20:13.380 --> 20:14.240]  Guten tag, dude.
[20:14.380 --> 20:14.740]  Hell yeah.
[20:15.140 --> 20:16.120]  Guten fucking tag.
[20:16.360 --> 20:17.160]  1910, Europe.
[20:17.300 --> 20:17.600]  Whatever.
[20:19.140 --> 20:20.100]  1905, France.
[20:20.400 --> 20:20.880]  Yeah, whatever.
[20:24.720 --> 20:25.360]  1881, Holland.
[20:25.400 --> 20:26.220]  Oh, there you go.
[20:26.480 --> 20:26.780]  That's some good stuff.
[20:26.800 --> 20:27.900]  That's a pretty solid Santa right there.
[20:27.980 --> 20:28.060]  Yeah.
[20:28.260 --> 20:28.580]  That's a good Santa.
[20:28.940 --> 20:30.080]  All right, let's open up some more.
[20:30.840 --> 20:31.680]  What do you got over there?
[20:31.740 --> 20:33.140]  We got some more mail you want to get to.
[20:33.740 --> 20:35.360]  Yeah, you want to get to a couple of these?
[20:35.800 --> 20:36.060]  Hello.
[20:36.220 --> 20:36.600]  Yes, I do.
[20:36.700 --> 20:37.720]  Hello, Geoff, Emily, and Eric.
[20:37.800 --> 20:41.340]  My husband, Scott, and I have been meaning to send some card packs for a while, but just
[20:41.340 --> 20:42.320]  recently got around to it.
[20:42.680 --> 20:45.280]  The Looney Tunes cards were picked up at a local convention in New Hampshire.
[20:45.500 --> 20:45.720]  Ooh.
[20:47.180 --> 20:48.260]  Have you ever been to New Hampshire?
[20:48.600 --> 20:49.140]  I don't know if I have.
[20:49.340 --> 20:49.780]  What's great about New Hampshire?
[20:49.780 --> 20:50.920]  If I have, I've driven through it.
[20:50.920 --> 20:52.160]  I would love to check it out, though.
[20:52.420 --> 20:53.860]  And maybe they'll invite us over for dinner sometime.
[20:54.020 --> 20:54.040]  Ooh.
[20:54.040 --> 20:58.560]  And the random other packs from a card shop in Maine, we like going to.
[20:58.640 --> 21:01.980]  Hope you enjoy them and maybe something interesting, funny out of them.
[21:02.540 --> 21:05.320]  You know what I know about, like, Maine and New Hampshire and Rhode Island and stuff?
[21:05.360 --> 21:05.480]  What?
[21:05.780 --> 21:06.160]  Dumb and Dumber.
[21:06.920 --> 21:07.240]  Yeah.
[21:07.440 --> 21:08.260]  They happen in Rhode Island.
[21:08.360 --> 21:09.120]  It's all the same place.
[21:09.520 --> 21:10.760]  Thank you for doing the break show.
[21:10.780 --> 21:12.160]  They happen in Rhode Island?
[21:12.440 --> 21:13.660]  That's where they were.
[21:13.840 --> 21:14.020]  Oh.
[21:14.040 --> 21:15.000]  And then they...
[21:15.000 --> 21:15.520]  Went to Denver?
[21:15.540 --> 21:16.780]  Yeah, then they went to...
[21:16.780 --> 21:17.660]  I didn't know that.
[21:18.280 --> 21:18.600]  Aspen.
[21:18.960 --> 21:19.320]  Aspen.
[21:19.660 --> 21:19.760]  Aspen.
[21:19.760 --> 21:20.100]  Scott and Renee.
[21:20.260 --> 21:21.280]  Thank you, Scott and Renee.
[21:21.780 --> 21:22.880]  And let me see what we have here.
[21:22.920 --> 21:24.680]  We've got a little top tiny...
[21:24.680 --> 21:25.940]  Oh, 88 yearbook sticker.
[21:26.020 --> 21:26.300]  Baseball.
[21:26.360 --> 21:26.880]  That's cool.
[21:27.040 --> 21:27.800]  New Kids on the Block.
[21:28.120 --> 21:28.880]  Dick Tracy.
[21:29.900 --> 21:30.260]  Superman.
[21:30.920 --> 21:31.640]  Looney Tunes.
[21:31.860 --> 21:32.640]  Oh, there's a bunch of those.
[21:32.780 --> 21:34.680]  And then 1988 score baseball.
[21:34.680 --> 21:34.980]  Okay.
[21:35.140 --> 21:36.220]  So you can pick, like, two or three.
[21:36.220 --> 21:37.720]  Let's do a Looney Tunes because I mentioned it.
[21:37.720 --> 21:38.080]  Yeah.
[21:38.100 --> 21:39.760]  We'll do that and...
[21:39.760 --> 21:40.340]  The Baby Baseball.
[21:40.340 --> 21:41.220]  The Baby Baseball.
[21:41.560 --> 21:41.760]  Okay.
[21:42.340 --> 21:42.580]  Okay.
[21:42.960 --> 21:43.940]  Thank you so much.
[21:43.960 --> 21:44.680]  Let's do a little baseball.
[21:45.200 --> 21:46.000]  How am I doing on time?
[21:46.000 --> 21:46.360]  Good.
[21:46.460 --> 21:46.860]  Okay.
[21:47.080 --> 21:47.740]  Plenty of it.
[21:48.320 --> 21:49.740]  1988 Baby Baseball.
[21:49.820 --> 21:50.160]  I have some more.
[21:50.160 --> 21:51.840]  Don't forget, at the end of the show, we're opening a signed football.
[21:52.040 --> 21:52.880]  We don't know who it's signed by.
[21:53.040 --> 21:53.760]  I'm excited to find out.
[21:54.160 --> 21:55.320]  Someone in the chat said...
[21:55.320 --> 21:58.820]  We were talking about how Christmas grapes and they say that they worked in grocery,
[21:58.980 --> 22:01.100]  but people will get grapes for New Year's Eve wishes.
[22:01.680 --> 22:01.980]  Oh.
[22:02.400 --> 22:02.600]  Yeah.
[22:02.760 --> 22:03.320]  What the...
[22:03.320 --> 22:04.040]  What does that mean?
[22:04.100 --> 22:06.220]  Santa is called...
[22:06.220 --> 22:06.620]  Oof.
[22:06.880 --> 22:07.280]  Paranoel?
[22:08.020 --> 22:09.200]  I can't read that.
[22:09.320 --> 22:10.200]  That's symbols.
[22:11.160 --> 22:11.560]  Jolumburen.
[22:12.440 --> 22:14.280]  Jolumburen and Pharosie.
[22:14.340 --> 22:14.740]  Pharisee.
[22:15.100 --> 22:15.500]  Pharisee.
[22:15.500 --> 22:16.740]  Which translates to the Christmas man.
[22:16.940 --> 22:17.440]  The guy...
[22:17.440 --> 22:18.760]  Hello, I am the Christmas man.
[22:18.800 --> 22:20.640]  The Christmas man, which is the same in Danish.
[22:20.900 --> 22:21.360]  There you go.
[22:21.640 --> 22:22.020]  All right, what do we got?
[22:22.080 --> 22:22.480]  Baby Baseball.
[22:22.500 --> 22:23.260]  We got Tim Wallach.
[22:23.580 --> 22:23.780]  Okay.
[22:24.160 --> 22:25.760]  On one side and stickers on the other.
[22:25.820 --> 22:26.180]  Superstar.
[22:26.360 --> 22:27.320]  We got...
[22:27.320 --> 22:28.200]  Ooh, Dave Winfey.
[22:28.320 --> 22:28.520]  Nice.
[22:29.120 --> 22:34.380]  We've got Don Mattingly on one side and it looks like Mark McGuire on the other side.
[22:34.460 --> 22:35.260]  That's pretty fucking cool.
[22:36.200 --> 22:37.700]  Here we have Andre Dawson.
[22:38.600 --> 22:39.780]  And then we have...
[22:39.780 --> 22:40.120]  Ooh.
[22:40.780 --> 22:41.700]  Ricky Henderson foil.
[22:41.980 --> 22:42.380]  Nice.
[22:42.900 --> 22:43.540]  Well, it's Dave Winslow on the other side.
[22:43.540 --> 22:44.040]  It's me, Ricky Henderson.
[22:44.660 --> 22:46.100]  Wait, is that Ricky Henderson on both sides?
[22:46.180 --> 22:46.620]  I guess it is.
[22:46.900 --> 22:47.040]  Yep.
[22:47.860 --> 22:48.500]  Okay, cool.
[22:48.780 --> 22:49.880]  Let's look at them Looney Tunes.
[22:49.920 --> 22:50.860]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[22:51.300 --> 22:51.840]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[22:51.840 --> 22:54.140]  We're gonna have to open something that I'll be...
[22:54.140 --> 22:55.920]  Some kind of cards that I can grade.
[22:56.140 --> 22:56.380]  Uh-huh.
[22:56.380 --> 22:57.200]  I find value in.
[22:57.740 --> 22:59.420]  This is what happens when we get to mail, Geoff.
[22:59.500 --> 22:59.820]  That's true.
[22:59.900 --> 23:00.140]  That's true.
[23:00.420 --> 23:01.500]  Who's your favorite Looney Tune?
[23:01.960 --> 23:02.960]  Porky Pig and Charlie Dog.
[23:03.240 --> 23:03.560]  Mmm.
[23:04.020 --> 23:04.340]  That's...
[23:04.340 --> 23:05.460]  I do like Charlie Dog.
[23:05.740 --> 23:06.420]  Foghorn Leghorn.
[23:06.520 --> 23:08.720]  I think classically a Bugs Bunny guy.
[23:08.940 --> 23:09.260]  Here we go.
[23:09.380 --> 23:09.640]  Right here.
[23:09.860 --> 23:10.860]  There he is.
[23:11.240 --> 23:11.980]  See, right.
[23:11.980 --> 23:13.400]  Which pitch is which?
[23:13.400 --> 23:13.720]  Yeah.
[23:13.940 --> 23:14.200]  Strike.
[23:14.520 --> 23:15.420]  I think that's great.
[23:16.620 --> 23:17.060]  Mmm.
[23:17.460 --> 23:18.060]  I like her.
[23:18.220 --> 23:19.580]  I like the Tasmanian Devil.
[23:19.900 --> 23:20.700]  Father knows worse.
[23:20.880 --> 23:23.900]  Geoff's mom said that they used to call him Taz when he was little.
[23:24.620 --> 23:24.760]  Geoff?
[23:24.900 --> 23:25.240]  Yosemite Sam.
[23:25.500 --> 23:25.740]  Mm-hmm.
[23:25.740 --> 23:26.480]  Geoff was Taz?
[23:26.720 --> 23:27.820]  Apparently because he was crazy.
[23:28.000 --> 23:28.540]  Yeah, sounds right.
[23:28.700 --> 23:30.000]  Oh, Sylvester's little cat.
[23:30.000 --> 23:31.180]  I like the baby cat.
[23:32.080 --> 23:32.520]  Hopalong Cat.
[23:32.520 --> 23:36.260]  Oh, the one that Mark Anthony, the big dog in...
[23:36.260 --> 23:37.280]  I think the cat's name is Cleo.
[23:37.320 --> 23:37.740]  Mark Anthony.
[23:37.860 --> 23:38.800]  Wasn't he in Van Halen?
[23:39.320 --> 23:39.660]  Roadrunner.
[23:39.660 --> 23:41.100]  I think Mark Anthony was the...
[23:41.100 --> 23:42.280]  Not Enrique Iglesias.
[23:42.420 --> 23:42.740]  Uh-huh.
[23:42.860 --> 23:42.960]  Yeah.
[23:43.040 --> 23:43.980]  Anyway, it's the big dog.
[23:44.080 --> 23:45.060]  Hold the mustard.
[23:47.180 --> 23:48.360]  And rabbit season.
[23:48.720 --> 23:48.900]  Yipe!
[23:49.400 --> 23:50.060]  These are upper deck.
[23:50.240 --> 23:50.780]  These are...
[23:50.780 --> 23:51.920]  I like the way these are drawn.
[23:52.140 --> 23:52.620]  Yeah, I do too.
[23:52.700 --> 23:52.820]  Hey.
[23:53.140 --> 23:53.920]  Oh, there's stuff on both sides.
[23:54.120 --> 23:54.800]  Check this out.
[23:55.340 --> 23:57.840]  Geoff, couldn't think of much to write other than thank you.
[23:59.260 --> 24:01.760]  Enjoy the fucking puzzles from Monkey Dean.
[24:02.260 --> 24:03.520]  Oh, these are million-dollar puzzles!
[24:04.000 --> 24:04.720]  Ooh, yay!
[24:05.100 --> 24:05.580]  Thank you.
[24:05.660 --> 24:06.480]  I put one of these together.
[24:06.740 --> 24:09.200]  Geoff loves puzzles, so these are cool.
[24:09.320 --> 24:09.400]  Dang.
[24:09.400 --> 24:10.140]  Do you know how to deal with these?
[24:10.140 --> 24:11.220]  No, why don't you explain it?
[24:11.300 --> 24:11.680]  All right.
[24:11.780 --> 24:12.220]  This is so cool.
[24:12.240 --> 24:13.640]  I'm going to go off my imperfect memory.
[24:13.720 --> 24:13.980]  Please.
[24:14.180 --> 24:15.880]  This was, I believe, a mischief drop.
[24:15.980 --> 24:16.360]  They are.
[24:16.460 --> 24:17.480]  I like mischief a lot.
[24:17.580 --> 24:17.760]  Mm-hmm.
[24:17.940 --> 24:19.460]  When this came out, I bought it.
[24:19.620 --> 24:19.920]  Mm-hmm.
[24:20.200 --> 24:21.160]  You buy this puzzle.
[24:21.300 --> 24:21.960]  You put it together.
[24:22.060 --> 24:24.320]  The puzzle is a QR code on the back.
[24:24.440 --> 24:25.180]  It's not just a QR code.
[24:25.240 --> 24:26.180]  It's a different QR code.
[24:26.220 --> 24:29.720]  It's actually a bit of a dickhead to put together, to be honest with you.
[24:29.880 --> 24:30.660]  We got two of them.
[24:30.820 --> 24:34.600]  Put it together, then you scan that QR code, and it tells you how much money you've won.
[24:34.660 --> 24:37.600]  You could win as little as a dollar and as much as a million dollars.
[24:37.620 --> 24:38.380]  What have you won so far?
[24:38.380 --> 24:39.180]  You said you put it together.
[24:39.240 --> 24:40.040]  I won a dollar.
[24:40.140 --> 24:40.560]  Oh, cool.
[24:40.660 --> 24:41.700]  Yeah, when I put my puzzle together.
[24:41.760 --> 24:42.700]  But now I have two more chances.
[24:43.040 --> 24:43.540]  So I'll tell you what.
[24:43.580 --> 24:44.160]  What was that guy's name?
[24:45.140 --> 24:45.700]  Monkey Gein.
[24:46.200 --> 24:50.460]  Monkey Gein, if I win a million dollars, I'll send you a dollar.
[24:50.660 --> 24:50.940]  Wow!
[24:52.540 --> 24:52.820]  Hey!
[24:54.360 --> 24:54.640]  Benevolence.
[24:54.880 --> 24:55.440]  I'll do something really nice.
[24:55.440 --> 24:56.160]  Don't make a promise.
[24:56.320 --> 24:56.860]  Don't make a promise.
[24:56.940 --> 24:57.320]  We don't know.
[24:57.440 --> 24:57.700]  I know.
[24:57.700 --> 24:59.020]  I thought it could happen to you or whatever.
[24:59.360 --> 24:59.980]  Was that the movie?
[25:00.100 --> 25:05.040]  It had the Nicolas Cage and Bridget Fonda, I believe.
[25:05.100 --> 25:06.160]  Oh, yeah, with the lottery ticket.
[25:06.160 --> 25:07.000]  And he won the lottery ticket.
[25:07.000 --> 25:07.760]  He had money in a tipper.
[25:08.300 --> 25:09.880]  I read that that was based on a true story.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.220]  And in the real story, the lady who won the lottery ended up dying.
[25:12.320 --> 25:12.900]  She got murdered, I think.
[25:12.900 --> 25:13.400]  Oh, wow.
[25:14.100 --> 25:14.420]  Dang.
[25:14.820 --> 25:16.680]  Well, hey, how about we get to some cards that you want to open?
[25:17.020 --> 25:17.740]  Yeah, how about that?
[25:17.960 --> 25:21.320]  Oh, also, I want to show stuff off that I'm not supposed to show stuff off.
[25:21.340 --> 25:21.880]  Oh, yay.
[25:22.700 --> 25:24.460]  I wasn't ever going to call it out.
[25:24.900 --> 25:27.520]  We're going to see some stuff that you're probably not supposed to see yet.
[25:27.880 --> 25:28.200]  Secrets.
[25:28.420 --> 25:29.720]  I want to talk about 2024.
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.200]  Because as you know, we plan stuff far in advance.
[25:32.220 --> 25:32.460]  Yeah.
[25:33.600 --> 25:34.260]  When we can.
[25:34.480 --> 25:35.700]  Some stuff we plan far in advance.
[25:35.700 --> 25:39.240]  We've got some Gerpling irons in the file.
[25:39.400 --> 25:41.380]  And I just want to show them off a little bit.
[25:41.600 --> 25:42.620]  Tony was like, don't do it.
[25:43.000 --> 25:43.540]  Don't do it.
[25:44.040 --> 25:44.660]  Don't disappoint.
[25:44.800 --> 25:45.760]  Don't tell the people yet.
[25:46.100 --> 25:46.940]  Start with this one.
[25:47.460 --> 25:50.260]  So in 2024, we had a radical idea.
[25:50.840 --> 25:53.500]  When we release new Gerplers, we want to release new Gerplers.
[25:53.660 --> 25:55.020]  There's 7.5 billion people on Earth.
[25:55.200 --> 25:56.220]  Most of them don't have Gerplers.
[25:56.240 --> 25:57.000]  Most of them don't.
[25:57.220 --> 25:59.200]  And we want them to have the opportunity to get them.
[25:59.380 --> 26:00.540]  And they want them, right?
[26:00.600 --> 26:00.760]  Yeah.
[26:01.320 --> 26:04.100]  But we don't want to retread over old ground.
[26:04.160 --> 26:04.480]  No, of course.
[26:04.480 --> 26:05.800]  We want each one to be different in some way.
[26:05.880 --> 26:07.380]  So we're going to do two special...
[26:07.380 --> 26:09.600]  We'll probably do more, but the first two Gerplers of 2024,
[26:10.020 --> 26:13.580]  we decided to take the green filament and the purple filament
[26:14.260 --> 26:16.360]  and mix them together into one mold.
[26:16.480 --> 26:17.120]  To make a true Gerpler.
[26:17.160 --> 26:18.980]  To make a true Gerpler.
[26:19.000 --> 26:20.360]  Why don't you lay it down right there and show the people.
[26:20.780 --> 26:23.400]  This is the first ever truly Gerpler.
[26:24.600 --> 26:25.140]  Show them.
[26:26.160 --> 26:26.520]  Boom.
[26:27.020 --> 26:27.260]  Yeah.
[26:28.360 --> 26:29.080]  Looks brown.
[26:29.640 --> 26:30.560]  That's what you think.
[26:30.660 --> 26:31.420]  But you can see it.
[26:31.420 --> 26:32.300]  You can tilt.
[26:32.780 --> 26:33.500]  But it's different.
[26:33.500 --> 26:35.280]  It's different than that gold one.
[26:35.380 --> 26:35.760]  Definitely different.
[26:35.760 --> 26:36.500]  So here's the thing.
[26:36.740 --> 26:37.480]  When you hold it...
[26:37.480 --> 26:38.000]  Oh my God.
[26:38.280 --> 26:38.980]  I'm sorry.
[26:39.160 --> 26:39.460]  I'm sorry.
[26:40.340 --> 26:42.420]  When you have it in the light...
[26:42.420 --> 26:44.160]  So that's where you start tilting it.
[26:44.460 --> 26:45.660]  You tilt it up a little bit.
[26:45.760 --> 26:48.720]  You can see the green more on the inside and the purple more on the outside.
[26:49.560 --> 26:54.560]  So this is going to be a release that we do that everyone can get a shot at.
[26:54.780 --> 26:56.480]  That is what we're trying to do.
[26:56.480 --> 26:57.620]  Bring the Gerplers to the people.
[26:57.760 --> 26:58.580]  We're trying to give...
[26:58.580 --> 27:00.320]  Bring the Gerplers to the people.
[27:00.460 --> 27:01.460]  We're trying to spread the Gerp.
[27:01.460 --> 27:06.820]  But when we talked about doing a Gerpler, we had an idea for another Gerpler.
[27:07.680 --> 27:09.680]  And Geoff, why don't you show off?
[27:09.920 --> 27:12.860]  Now this Gerpler is going to be a first only Gerpler.
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.020]  We think that this is going to be first exclusive.
[27:15.400 --> 27:17.700]  We want to offer this specially to...
[27:17.700 --> 27:19.660]  So everyone can get a shot at the true Gerpler.
[27:19.920 --> 27:20.600]  Yeah, the true...
[27:20.600 --> 27:23.500]  And by the way, it's just like it catches the light in different angles.
[27:23.660 --> 27:24.340]  And it's just like...
[27:24.340 --> 27:25.040]  Purple and green and Gerple.
[27:25.040 --> 27:26.480]  You get caught off guard by how beautiful it can be.
[27:26.580 --> 27:27.620]  Yes, it is purple and Gerple.
[27:27.760 --> 27:29.460]  This one's just ombre.
[27:29.760 --> 27:30.560]  That's so good.
[27:31.820 --> 27:33.040]  It's very nice.
[27:33.120 --> 27:34.080]  This is a production sample.
[27:34.300 --> 27:35.740]  Tony said that we have to give it back.
[27:36.200 --> 27:39.760]  But this will probably be a first exclusive Gerpler in 2024.
[27:40.140 --> 27:44.080]  So anyone who has a first account on Rischief can log on and buy this.
[27:44.120 --> 27:44.780]  It won't run out.
[27:44.800 --> 27:45.700]  I have a first account.
[27:45.840 --> 27:46.560]  It won't run out?
[27:47.080 --> 27:47.780]  I don't...
[27:47.780 --> 27:49.180]  Stop making promises.
[27:49.480 --> 27:50.120]  Oh, I shouldn't have said...
[27:50.120 --> 27:51.300]  No, you shouldn't have said that at all.
[27:51.300 --> 27:52.240]  It'll probably run out.
[27:52.380 --> 27:54.160]  It's definitely going to sell out.
[27:54.280 --> 27:55.720]  I don't know why he would say that.
[27:55.780 --> 27:57.380]  All right, it's going to run out, so get it.
[27:57.420 --> 27:58.640]  But it's only available for first members.
[27:58.640 --> 28:01.980]  So it'll be for first members, so only first members will get a shot at getting this.
[28:02.200 --> 28:03.720]  Which, again, will run out!
[28:04.140 --> 28:05.340]  I want to be really clear.
[28:05.580 --> 28:07.240]  He said that it'll stay in stock forever.
[28:07.400 --> 28:07.760]  It won't.
[28:07.840 --> 28:08.640]  He wants to be clear.
[28:08.800 --> 28:11.180]  I heard that Geoff said it wasn't going to run out.
[28:11.220 --> 28:12.040]  Jesus Christ.
[28:12.280 --> 28:13.360]  I don't know why you would say it.
[28:13.460 --> 28:14.260]  I'm the people's princess.
[28:14.680 --> 28:15.480]  I speak for the people.
[28:15.820 --> 28:17.540]  And then Tony really didn't want me to show these.
[28:17.760 --> 28:19.020]  These aren't going to come off for a while.
[28:19.120 --> 28:19.680]  Yeah, these aren't...
[28:19.680 --> 28:21.140]  I don't even know when these come out.
[28:23.840 --> 28:26.040]  The official number 16 foam pencil.
[28:26.340 --> 28:27.160]  Show them back.
[28:28.320 --> 28:29.600]  He's in youth form right now.
[28:30.160 --> 28:31.220]  This is a production sample.
[28:31.560 --> 28:32.820]  The real one's going to come out thicker.
[28:32.940 --> 28:34.040]  It's going to actually be nicer than this.
[28:34.060 --> 28:34.860]  And this is pretty nice.
[28:34.920 --> 28:37.420]  If that's coming out next year, like at some point...
[28:37.420 --> 28:37.500]  Check this out.
[28:38.480 --> 28:38.760]  Oh my God.
[28:38.760 --> 28:39.680]  Wow, you're doing it!
[28:39.940 --> 28:40.500]  Hell yeah.
[28:40.940 --> 28:41.360]  Get it.
[28:41.540 --> 28:42.040]  Get it.
[28:42.340 --> 28:43.240]  That has to go back in their office.
[28:43.320 --> 28:44.540]  What sport is...
[28:44.540 --> 28:46.140]  I guess like baseball is starting in a round then?
[28:46.220 --> 28:49.740]  Yeah, but the nice thing about these puppies is they're great for any sport.
[28:49.860 --> 28:51.720]  Yeah, but I just want to see them at every sport.
[28:51.840 --> 28:53.000]  You're going to want to see them at every sport.
[28:53.040 --> 28:54.380]  You're going to want to see them at an NBA game.
[28:54.400 --> 28:55.040]  Well, this is how you...
[28:55.040 --> 28:55.600]  And they'll be...
[28:56.000 --> 28:56.680]  I'm thirsty.
[28:56.780 --> 28:57.780]  Hey, can I get a drink over here?
[28:57.780 --> 28:58.840]  Can I get a drink over here on Parch?
[28:58.920 --> 28:59.280]  Oh, thanks.
[29:03.340 --> 29:05.960]  Thank God I got the giant foam Gerpler.
[29:06.200 --> 29:07.000]  That's so awesome.
[29:09.400 --> 29:10.660]  So that is...
[29:10.660 --> 29:11.660]  That's the Gerpler.
[29:12.380 --> 29:13.100]  Very excited.
[29:13.280 --> 29:15.260]  Everybody's been wanting the red Gerpler to come out.
[29:15.300 --> 29:15.880]  Yeah, there it is.
[29:16.560 --> 29:17.900]  You too can have a red Gerpler.
[29:18.020 --> 29:18.780]  I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
[29:18.780 --> 29:20.140]  I think these are so great.
[29:20.320 --> 29:22.260]  These are always just like half an idea.
[29:22.480 --> 29:25.020]  And then our merch team goes like this.
[29:25.020 --> 29:27.500]  And we go, this is so much cooler than I fucking imagined.
[29:27.780 --> 29:29.440]  When you see it, you're like, oh, that actually is pretty cool.
[29:29.440 --> 29:31.900]  Yeah, I thought it was going to be kind of fucking wacky.
[29:31.980 --> 29:32.740]  This rules.
[29:33.060 --> 29:34.160]  This looks good.
[29:34.260 --> 29:37.020]  So anyway, Gerplers on sale next year.
[29:37.120 --> 29:38.880]  This will be on sale for everyone.
[29:38.980 --> 29:40.000]  This will be first members only.
[29:40.200 --> 29:41.380]  This is a reason to continue.
[29:42.120 --> 29:43.060]  Let's do one...
[29:43.060 --> 29:44.760]  We have one more piece of mail we should have got to.
[29:44.860 --> 29:46.080]  You want to get some more mail?
[29:46.160 --> 29:47.600]  Just this piece right here, because this was really nice.
[29:47.640 --> 29:47.900]  This one?
[29:48.320 --> 29:48.600]  Yeah.
[29:49.260 --> 29:50.180]  Just don't show...
[29:50.180 --> 29:51.560]  I mean, flip it so that way you don't show that.
[29:54.400 --> 30:00.180]  Somebody made us a 3D printed fuckface stand.
[30:00.320 --> 30:01.380]  That's awesome.
[30:02.360 --> 30:03.360]  Isn't that beautiful?
[30:03.400 --> 30:04.160]  That's so cool.
[30:04.400 --> 30:05.680]  3D printing is so cool.
[30:05.800 --> 30:06.280]  It is.
[30:06.740 --> 30:07.600]  It prints in three dimensions.
[30:08.320 --> 30:10.320]  And then there's also some other stuff in here.
[30:10.920 --> 30:11.280]  Drops.
[30:11.340 --> 30:11.740]  That's really neat.
[30:11.760 --> 30:12.740]  I don't know if there was a note.
[30:12.820 --> 30:13.500]  I think we're going to put it right here.
[30:14.500 --> 30:16.420]  It says Magic the Baseballing.
[30:17.040 --> 30:17.540]  What is that?
[30:17.800 --> 30:19.680]  Oh, and poker chips.
[30:19.680 --> 30:23.060]  Secret lair drop series, Magic the Baseballing.
[30:23.140 --> 30:24.340]  I don't know anything about it.
[30:24.340 --> 30:24.460]  Let's do it.
[30:24.460 --> 30:27.060]  Let's fucking find out what this is.
[30:30.430 --> 30:30.870]  Okay.
[30:31.230 --> 30:34.310]  So it says, thank you for being a part of the secret lair.
[30:34.450 --> 30:34.770]  Okay.
[30:35.770 --> 30:37.970]  Here we have the gate watch.
[30:38.250 --> 30:38.370]  What?
[30:38.670 --> 30:41.230]  So are they like Magic the Gathering, but they did baseball?
[30:41.690 --> 30:43.350]  Fisher's in there going insane.
[30:43.450 --> 30:44.670]  Is it real magic stuff?
[30:44.810 --> 30:44.990]  Yeah.
[30:45.290 --> 30:46.350]  Is that what it is?
[30:46.730 --> 30:46.970]  Yeah.
[30:47.290 --> 30:47.590]  Okay.
[30:47.630 --> 30:48.370]  Oh, dang.
[30:48.450 --> 30:49.130]  Justin's confirming.
[30:49.130 --> 30:50.270]  Johnny Goldman.
[30:50.710 --> 30:54.510]  So this is Magic the Gathering did a crossover with baseball stuff.
[30:54.770 --> 30:55.280]  Jace Bellerin.
[30:56.230 --> 30:58.010]  And Fisher is going, if you guys don't want those, I'll take them.
[30:58.170 --> 30:58.990]  That's always at the end of the...
[30:58.990 --> 30:59.630]  It's fine, it's fine.
[30:59.670 --> 31:00.030]  I'll take them.
[31:00.070 --> 31:01.850]  I mean, if you guys don't even want them, it's not even a big deal.
[31:02.050 --> 31:03.490]  The cameras are off.
[31:04.250 --> 31:05.130]  I'll take those.
[31:05.270 --> 31:06.290]  I can just check them out.
[31:07.110 --> 31:07.790]  Chandler Nalar.
[31:09.870 --> 31:10.550]  Garrett Wildspeaker.
[31:10.870 --> 31:13.350]  These, the art on these are fucking cool.
[31:13.550 --> 31:16.010]  And then this is a sedge silver.
[31:16.010 --> 31:17.210]  These are actually...
[31:17.210 --> 31:22.530]  This is the first time in my life Magic the Gathering has been interesting to me.
[31:22.730 --> 31:27.970]  Would you rather learn and try really hard to be really good at Pokemon or Magic the Gathering?
[31:28.130 --> 31:28.450]  Magic.
[31:29.110 --> 31:31.370]  Oh, I think Pokemon probably because it seems easier.
[31:31.750 --> 31:33.010]  Magic the Gathering is so involved.
[31:33.130 --> 31:34.350]  Magic's got dragons and shit in it.
[31:34.530 --> 31:36.250]  Yeah, that's more like Dungeon D&D.
[31:36.330 --> 31:37.790]  Yeah, it's just so involved.
[31:38.070 --> 31:39.010]  Do you have another secret lair one?
[31:39.030 --> 31:39.630]  Do you want to open it?
[31:39.770 --> 31:41.270]  No, we'll hold off on it for the next...
[31:41.270 --> 31:41.890]  Do you want a snack?
[31:43.570 --> 31:44.710]  Yeah, we'll put it in the back.
[31:45.430 --> 31:47.290]  Don't put him on the spot like that. He doesn't know what he's doing.
[31:47.450 --> 31:49.010]  And then some baseball spin chips.
[31:49.130 --> 31:49.590]  I don't know what these are.
[31:49.590 --> 31:50.530]  We'll look into that.
[31:50.850 --> 31:51.950]  We'll look into that soon.
[31:52.110 --> 31:52.250]  Okay.
[31:54.390 --> 31:55.030]  And then...
[31:55.030 --> 31:55.990]  Let's open these parts.
[31:56.630 --> 31:57.150]  What are we opening?
[31:57.390 --> 31:58.750]  This is going to be... this just dropped.
[31:58.970 --> 31:59.350]  What is it?
[31:59.530 --> 32:00.350]  Like two weeks ago.
[32:00.470 --> 32:02.090]  It's Prism NBA Draft.
[32:02.790 --> 32:03.630]  It's dog shit.
[32:03.710 --> 32:04.630]  I wouldn't buy this.
[32:04.870 --> 32:05.990]  I just want to see what they look like.
[32:06.110 --> 32:06.250]  Okay.
[32:06.330 --> 32:07.770]  I can't recommend you buy these.
[32:07.890 --> 32:09.670]  If you're going to buy it, this is the year to buy it.
[32:09.690 --> 32:11.730]  They don't have or maintain value.
[32:13.210 --> 32:16.550]  But because of Wim Binyama, all bets are off.
[32:16.630 --> 32:18.450]  But in the past, you've liked Prism.
[32:18.710 --> 32:20.070]  So why is this Prism bad?
[32:20.130 --> 32:20.930]  Prism Draft is bad.
[32:20.930 --> 32:21.510]  Oh, this is college.
[32:21.510 --> 32:22.490]  This is just them in college.
[32:22.490 --> 32:22.970]  Got it.
[32:23.390 --> 32:26.510]  Donovan Klingin, Jalen Clark, Bradley Beal.
[32:26.570 --> 32:30.530]  So you get like a card of Bradley Beal when he was in college 15 years ago.
[32:30.650 --> 32:34.310]  Kobe Bufkin, a black and white Magic Johnson card.
[32:34.450 --> 32:34.670]  Hey, cool.
[32:35.030 --> 32:37.170]  Kendrick Davis, Karl Malone.
[32:38.510 --> 32:39.330]  That's a cool name.
[32:39.690 --> 32:40.630]  Leaky Black.
[32:40.970 --> 32:41.310]  Hell yeah.
[32:42.030 --> 32:43.950]  Well, this is one of the ones you want right here.
[32:44.650 --> 32:45.210]  Here you go.
[32:45.290 --> 32:45.990]  Victor Wim Binyama.
[32:47.970 --> 32:49.330]  That might actually be something.
[32:49.330 --> 32:49.770]  That's a good one.
[32:49.890 --> 32:50.790]  I get my sleeves.
[32:50.970 --> 32:51.610]  That might have a dollar.
[32:51.930 --> 32:53.510]  That might be a little something.
[32:53.570 --> 32:54.530]  And then a Chris Paul brilliance.
[32:54.630 --> 32:55.390]  That's actually cool.
[32:55.590 --> 32:56.870]  That Chris Paul, that's nice.
[32:57.370 --> 32:58.150]  You got a couple of good ones.
[32:58.310 --> 33:00.310]  Someone in the chat said something about this lion.
[33:00.530 --> 33:02.430]  So let's pull it so you can look it up.
[33:02.470 --> 33:02.970]  Yeah, let's look it up.
[33:03.050 --> 33:03.830]  Chris Paul again.
[33:04.370 --> 33:05.030]  K.J. Williams.
[33:05.270 --> 33:06.090]  Charles Barkley.
[33:06.190 --> 33:06.750]  All the old dudes.
[33:06.910 --> 33:07.070]  Nice.
[33:08.310 --> 33:09.890]  All these dudes are from before color.
[33:09.890 --> 33:10.830]  Jared McCain.
[33:11.830 --> 33:12.630]  Ricky Council.
[33:15.990 --> 33:16.690]  Turquavion Smith.
[33:16.830 --> 33:16.950]  Sorry.
[33:17.730 --> 33:18.530]  Anthony Black.
[33:18.770 --> 33:19.710]  Justin Edwards.
[33:19.990 --> 33:21.070]  We got a Kavante George.
[33:22.050 --> 33:23.610]  I think the side ones are...
[33:23.610 --> 33:23.970]  I don't know.
[33:24.590 --> 33:25.850]  And then a Bradley Beal.
[33:26.330 --> 33:27.290]  Red Cracked Ice.
[33:27.450 --> 33:28.530]  We'll open up one more pack.
[33:28.610 --> 33:28.890]  Okay.
[33:29.370 --> 33:30.690]  And then we'll move on to something else.
[33:31.530 --> 33:33.870]  I like how much non-sports stuff we opened up today.
[33:34.250 --> 33:35.230]  Yeah, I think it's fun.
[33:35.470 --> 33:37.550]  Hey, that's what happens when we get the mail, you know what I mean?
[33:37.670 --> 33:38.450]  Jalen Pickett.
[33:38.590 --> 33:39.590]  Damien Lillard.
[33:39.590 --> 33:41.010]  Kavante George.
[33:41.130 --> 33:41.990]  Marquise Noel.
[33:42.190 --> 33:42.970]  Brandon Miller.
[33:43.110 --> 33:43.470]  Brandon Miller.
[33:44.670 --> 33:45.510]  What's great about him?
[33:45.930 --> 33:46.910]  He played for Alabama.
[33:47.170 --> 33:48.350]  He was the second pick in the draft.
[33:48.710 --> 33:50.290]  Is he the one that had the little incident?
[33:50.290 --> 33:53.350]  He's currently in civil court right now for a wrongful death suit.
[33:54.070 --> 33:54.870]  Adam Flagler.
[33:55.250 --> 33:56.390]  Is that why you want to save it?
[33:56.470 --> 33:57.250]  Because you're like, zero?
[33:57.630 --> 33:57.730]  Yeah.
[33:58.030 --> 33:58.630]  Love it.
[33:58.690 --> 33:59.090]  Here we go.
[33:59.330 --> 34:00.210]  There's a...
[34:00.210 --> 34:01.090]  Yeah, Grady Dick!
[34:01.130 --> 34:02.270]  Oh, so that's our man.
[34:03.510 --> 34:04.110]  Save that.
[34:05.010 --> 34:06.590]  You see someone...
[34:07.150 --> 34:08.030]  I think someone...
[34:08.030 --> 34:08.410]  We'll do one more.
[34:08.410 --> 34:20.890]  Someone on the fuckface subreddit works for some G-League team or whatever and they had to make a Grady Dick graphic because they were playing the Toronto 613 or something like that.
[34:20.910 --> 34:21.110]  Oh.
[34:21.550 --> 34:23.350]  Did Grady Dick go down to G-League?
[34:24.090 --> 34:24.990]  He's bouncing around.
[34:25.050 --> 34:25.170]  Yeah.
[34:25.490 --> 34:25.810]  Okay.
[34:26.530 --> 34:28.350]  That's what those Grady Dicks do.
[34:31.230 --> 34:32.670]  Olivier McKenzie-Prosper.
[34:32.970 --> 34:34.310]  Hey, Victor Wiminyan, I'm a baseman.
[34:34.970 --> 34:36.590]  It's not going to be worth anything, but that's cool.
[34:38.230 --> 34:39.090]  Kawhi, hangin' up.
[34:39.190 --> 34:39.810]  There's Grady Dick.
[34:39.990 --> 34:40.430]  We'll look at that one.
[34:40.430 --> 34:41.310]  SDSU Kawhi also.
[34:41.410 --> 34:41.610]  Hell yeah.
[34:41.690 --> 34:42.550]  We got double-dicked.
[34:43.350 --> 34:44.050]  Desmond Cambridge.
[34:44.070 --> 34:44.730]  Save it for your show.
[34:44.750 --> 34:45.310]  Cam Whitmore.
[34:45.310 --> 34:46.350]  Crush My Pearls every Tuesday.
[34:46.870 --> 34:47.350]  Jimmy Butler.
[34:48.430 --> 34:49.150]  KJ Evans.
[34:49.910 --> 34:50.830]  Trace Jackson Davis.
[34:50.930 --> 34:51.650]  Purple Wave.
[34:51.830 --> 34:52.490]  That's a cool card.
[34:52.490 --> 34:53.230]  That's a cool card.
[34:53.390 --> 34:53.870]  Probably not.
[34:53.890 --> 34:54.750]  And then Jalen Clark.
[34:55.130 --> 34:57.190]  You know what I think could be something really interesting?
[34:57.690 --> 34:57.790]  What's that?
[34:58.110 --> 34:58.630]  Thank you.
[34:59.310 --> 35:03.910]  You talk a lot about the different types of cards and the different ones.
[35:04.370 --> 35:07.930]  And you have so many Marcus Smart cards that are the same card, but the different...
[35:09.930 --> 35:11.990]  I think that'd be a good show-and-tell.
[35:12.190 --> 35:13.550]  Do you show like a rainbow or something?
[35:13.750 --> 35:15.630]  Yeah, be like, hey, this is the regular one.
[35:15.790 --> 35:16.630]  This is the Cracked Ice.
[35:16.890 --> 35:17.510]  I can do that.
[35:18.530 --> 35:19.290]  That's a great idea.
[35:19.350 --> 35:21.550]  I don't have a complete rainbow of anything, but I can get close.
[35:21.770 --> 35:22.910]  Well, let's complete one of them.
[35:23.190 --> 35:24.130]  This, I'm going to open up...
[35:24.130 --> 35:24.810]  Jack got me these.
[35:24.950 --> 35:25.510]  Superfan Jack.
[35:25.710 --> 35:26.850]  He saw these at a Walmart.
[35:28.710 --> 35:29.150]  What's that?
[35:29.270 --> 35:29.790]  Minor League fan.
[35:30.790 --> 35:31.470]  Minor League fan.
[35:31.490 --> 35:31.870]  It's fine.
[35:31.870 --> 35:34.970]  He doesn't even want to come on the break show.
[35:35.150 --> 35:36.690]  Yeah, that's right.
[35:36.950 --> 35:40.730]  So what we're looking for here, Zion rookies.
[35:40.830 --> 35:41.870]  This is Zion's rookie year.
[35:42.130 --> 35:44.110]  And he's just tearing it up.
[35:44.910 --> 35:46.970]  Zion is my fucking guy this year, dude.
[35:47.310 --> 35:49.390]  He's on the court.
[35:49.510 --> 35:52.070]  He's up and down that court like lightning, baby.
[35:52.730 --> 35:53.190]  Or thunder.
[35:54.810 --> 35:57.940]  Do you see the thing that Stephen A. Smith said about...
[35:58.570 --> 35:59.410]  It was so disrespectful.
[36:00.330 --> 36:08.830]  He said that it's well known around New Orleans that if Zion goes to your restaurant, he'll eat the menu.
[36:08.990 --> 36:09.670]  Are you serious?
[36:11.270 --> 36:13.770]  And he was like, that's a direct quote.
[36:13.890 --> 36:14.730]  Chefs have told me that.
[36:14.790 --> 36:16.710]  They're like, we love to see Zion come in because he'll eat the table.
[36:17.310 --> 36:18.570]  Which is so insane.
[36:18.730 --> 36:19.310]  That's crazy.
[36:19.490 --> 36:23.110]  And also, that didn't happen because Stephen A. Smith doesn't talk to chefs.
[36:23.250 --> 36:24.010]  Yeah, I know, right?
[36:25.230 --> 36:27.950]  That's like when Howard Stern is like, I was just talking to my friend.
[36:28.810 --> 36:31.170]  Peyton Pritchard, emergent rookie. That's cool.
[36:32.950 --> 36:33.830]  Markel Fultz.
[36:34.730 --> 36:36.530]  I feel so bad for Zion. He's under so much scrutiny.
[36:37.010 --> 36:39.810]  That being said, he could fucking be a little bit more reliable and play better.
[36:39.910 --> 36:44.270]  I mean, he's under scrutiny that he could make the change for right now.
[36:44.330 --> 36:44.670]  That's true.
[36:45.370 --> 36:46.210]  Trae Young.
[36:46.810 --> 36:47.550]  Kyle Kuzma.
[36:51.390 --> 36:53.870]  Kyle Kuzma now plays for the Washington...
[36:53.870 --> 36:56.690]  He is part of the best duo in basketball.
[36:56.690 --> 36:59.110]  Kyle Kuzma, Jordan Poole.
[36:59.110 --> 37:01.090]  You might have shared an elevator.
[37:01.550 --> 37:03.350]  Yeah, I was wondering why that name sounded familiar.
[37:03.610 --> 37:04.570]  Harrison Barnes.
[37:05.110 --> 37:05.810]  Nerlens Noel.
[37:06.110 --> 37:10.750]  I really liked Nerlens Noel and I really thought that he was going to be more impactful.
[37:10.970 --> 37:11.550]  Sadly, he wasn't.
[37:11.630 --> 37:13.770]  RJ Barrett, second year, Green Prism.
[37:15.070 --> 37:17.230]  And then RJ Hampton, base rookie.
[37:17.370 --> 37:17.810]  Not worth anything.
[37:18.790 --> 37:21.070]  What's the most common name in the NBA right now?
[37:21.230 --> 37:21.470]  RJ.
[37:21.650 --> 37:22.590]  Lots of RJs.
[37:24.070 --> 37:25.030]  Some Kobe's.
[37:25.270 --> 37:26.130]  Couple Kobe's.
[37:26.830 --> 37:27.730]  I don't know.
[37:27.810 --> 37:28.390]  It's a good question.
[37:28.930 --> 37:30.070]  DeMarcus is one.
[37:30.870 --> 37:31.610]  Here's a...
[37:32.110 --> 37:32.850]  Chris, maybe?
[37:33.350 --> 37:34.370]  Oh, Chris is good.
[37:34.390 --> 37:35.430]  How many triple J's are there?
[37:36.110 --> 37:36.370]  One.
[37:36.630 --> 37:37.310]  That I'm aware of.
[37:37.950 --> 37:41.630]  Here is a box of Tops Chrome 2023 Hobby.
[37:41.970 --> 37:43.510]  Is that with the misprints?
[37:43.750 --> 37:44.410]  I don't know.
[37:44.530 --> 37:45.510]  I bought this so long ago.
[37:45.650 --> 37:46.150]  I don't know.
[37:46.330 --> 37:47.870]  I saw it in the...
[37:47.870 --> 37:50.530]  I saw it in the office and went, oh, I forgot about that.
[37:50.790 --> 37:52.310]  I probably bought this eight months ago.
[37:52.390 --> 37:55.690]  I think that was the one that you were saying that they...
[37:55.690 --> 37:57.530]  I don't know if it has super refractors or not.
[37:57.850 --> 37:58.870]  Had the like...
[37:58.870 --> 38:01.150]  They reprinted originals or something?
[38:01.150 --> 38:03.970]  This doesn't have the super refractors in it, but it does...
[38:03.970 --> 38:05.730]  It probably will have the buyback...
[38:06.330 --> 38:06.730]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:06.730 --> 38:07.150]  That's what I meant.
[38:07.190 --> 38:07.610]  The buyback.
[38:07.750 --> 38:08.590]  Buyback MVP cards.
[38:08.830 --> 38:11.090]  That's worth more though, right?
[38:11.550 --> 38:12.610]  The buyback stuff...
[38:12.610 --> 38:12.930]  Yeah.
[38:13.450 --> 38:16.530]  The super refractor stuff is the ones that are like the one of ones worth $30,000.
[38:16.910 --> 38:17.750]  I think that's Bowman.
[38:17.910 --> 38:18.470]  Let's do it.
[38:18.610 --> 38:19.490]  But there was the one that...
[38:19.490 --> 38:19.610]  Yeah.
[38:19.690 --> 38:21.210]  But it was the one that they were like, oops, Sally.
[38:21.310 --> 38:23.490]  I know we sent out a lot of things that said one of one, but they're not.
[38:23.690 --> 38:24.590]  Oh, that's right.
[38:24.590 --> 38:25.370]  That's Bowman.
[38:25.570 --> 38:26.270]  Oh, okay.
[38:26.670 --> 38:27.470]  Kyle Tucker.
[38:27.610 --> 38:28.450]  Pinky Pup.
[38:29.110 --> 38:30.010]  I hear you, man.
[38:30.110 --> 38:31.550]  Jazz Chisholm refractor.
[38:31.630 --> 38:31.870]  Yeah.
[38:32.670 --> 38:33.270]  Wow, that's cool.
[38:33.390 --> 38:33.950]  Great baseball name.
[38:34.230 --> 38:34.450]  Oh, shit.
[38:34.610 --> 38:35.590]  J-Rod, Rookie Cup.
[38:35.670 --> 38:36.110]  That's cool.
[38:36.190 --> 38:36.470]  That's nice.
[38:36.730 --> 38:37.250]  And me.
[38:37.250 --> 38:37.790]  Head fell off.
[38:38.010 --> 38:38.170]  Yep.
[38:38.530 --> 38:39.470]  He's done, baby.
[38:40.170 --> 38:40.750]  Yeah, he's done.
[38:41.370 --> 38:43.170]  Now he can go to Saudi Arabia and play over there.
[38:43.170 --> 38:45.530]  Yeah, he can go play against Bartolo Cologne.
[38:47.610 --> 38:47.970]  Go Tigers.
[38:47.990 --> 38:49.110]  Corey Seager.
[38:49.670 --> 38:50.930]  Cody Bellinger.
[38:51.810 --> 38:53.730]  Fucking return to form as soon as you left the Dodgers.
[38:53.730 --> 38:54.470]  Yep.
[38:54.730 --> 38:59.350]  Yvonne Herrera, base rookie, and a Bobby Witt, rookie cup.
[38:59.430 --> 39:03.870]  How do you think that Shohei Otani at the Dodgers is going to do for your Padres?
[39:04.550 --> 39:07.470]  You know, I think it's a great pickup for that team.
[39:07.990 --> 39:12.170]  The way they're pushing the contract off and everything, they'll still be able to sign a lot of guys.
[39:12.270 --> 39:15.030]  So it's going to be a very dominating team.
[39:15.210 --> 39:19.950]  However, with Dave Roberts at the helm, I'm very excited to see in a do-or-die game,
[39:19.950 --> 39:24.570]  to watch him pull Shohei Otani after four innings for no reason.
[39:25.550 --> 39:26.810]  Let's get into that bullpen!
[39:27.190 --> 39:28.510]  I don't think he's going to pitch next year at all.
[39:28.730 --> 39:30.590]  No, he's not. Yeah, he's Tommy John'd it, baby.
[39:30.970 --> 39:31.790]  So he's just hitting.
[39:32.030 --> 39:33.790]  So that's why we have to throw at his arm.
[39:33.970 --> 39:34.850]  $700 million DH.
[39:35.130 --> 39:35.330]  Why?
[39:36.770 --> 39:38.030]  Shohei's not pitching anymore?
[39:38.190 --> 39:38.690]  He will.
[39:38.890 --> 39:39.870]  Just not next year.
[39:39.890 --> 39:40.550]  He didn't get the surgery?
[39:40.750 --> 39:41.450]  Yeah, Tommy John, yeah.
[39:42.770 --> 39:43.490]  Chris Sale.
[39:44.530 --> 39:46.830]  He used to be a White Sox? I think so.
[39:48.690 --> 39:50.830]  Francisco Lindor and the Torque.
[39:53.730 --> 39:55.950]  I want to open enough of these to find the autograph.
[39:56.390 --> 39:58.210]  I was looking at these numbers where it was like,
[39:58.390 --> 40:02.510]  Shohei Otani's deal with the Dodgers is for ten years for $700 million.
[40:02.890 --> 40:05.350]  The Tigers' team payroll is $84 million.
[40:06.070 --> 40:10.390]  It is like the A's, I think, have their payrolls smaller than that.
[40:10.510 --> 40:12.690]  And the Orioles, I think, is smaller than that.
[40:13.110 --> 40:16.450]  Isn't there a thing where everyone has a cap, but they just pay a fee?
[40:16.450 --> 40:19.430]  Yeah, there's a salary cap, but the way that they structured the contract,
[40:19.450 --> 40:22.510]  he's only taking a lesser amount per year,
[40:22.630 --> 40:25.050]  and then they're paying him off later or something.
[40:26.410 --> 40:27.050]  Tristan Casas.
[40:27.270 --> 40:28.690]  Just so dumb, just take all the money.
[40:28.950 --> 40:29.370]  Fuck the team.
[40:29.550 --> 40:30.590]  Fuck up the Dodgers, please.
[40:31.010 --> 40:31.190]  No!
[40:31.650 --> 40:31.730]  Yeah.
[40:32.270 --> 40:34.750]  And then also, the last time we played Shohei Otani,
[40:34.850 --> 40:36.210]  I think we hit like three home runs off of him.
[40:36.310 --> 40:37.730]  So we're just going to own Shohei and that'll be fine.
[40:37.950 --> 40:39.930]  So he's really good at throwing home runs at you guys?
[40:40.050 --> 40:40.690]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[40:40.790 --> 40:41.790]  Just keep pitching.
[40:42.550 --> 40:44.010]  Again, he's not pitching next year, so it's fine.
[40:44.330 --> 40:45.630]  So you won't get any home runs, though?
[40:45.630 --> 40:46.330]  Oh, shoot.
[40:46.790 --> 40:46.890]  Damn.
[40:47.990 --> 40:48.550]  Luis Castillo.
[40:48.550 --> 40:49.750]  We'll hit him off Julio Arias.
[40:49.910 --> 40:50.010]  Ooh.
[40:50.090 --> 40:50.930]  Eloy Jimenez.
[40:51.470 --> 40:51.690]  Ooh.
[40:51.690 --> 40:51.830]  Fire.
[40:51.830 --> 40:53.210]  I think he's in a little...
[40:53.210 --> 40:54.210]  Yeah, I think he's fired.
[40:55.050 --> 40:55.910]  He's fired up.
[40:56.050 --> 40:56.210]  Yeah.
[40:57.470 --> 40:58.670]  So who's their pitcher now?
[40:58.790 --> 40:59.850]  Shohei Otani's not...
[40:59.850 --> 41:00.690]  The guy with the red hair?
[41:00.830 --> 41:01.070]  Kershaw.
[41:01.070 --> 41:01.650]  They got Kershaw.
[41:01.850 --> 41:02.590]  Dustin May, I think.
[41:02.670 --> 41:03.010]  Kershaw.
[41:03.210 --> 41:03.770]  Dustin May, yeah.
[41:03.970 --> 41:05.190]  They have to sign some more, though.
[41:05.490 --> 41:06.310]  Ooh, that's a cool card.
[41:06.730 --> 41:07.290]  I like that one.
[41:08.210 --> 41:08.830]  That is nice.
[41:08.870 --> 41:09.470]  That's probably numbered.
[41:10.050 --> 41:10.390]  Nope.
[41:11.690 --> 41:12.150]  Oh, it is.
[41:12.150 --> 41:12.870]  I'm sorry, it's on the front.
[41:12.870 --> 41:15.530]  It's numbered 291 to 299.
[41:17.470 --> 41:18.430]  What do we got here?
[41:18.570 --> 41:21.190]  Garrett Mitchell and Jordan Walker, rookies.
[41:21.570 --> 41:23.270]  We're going to go until we get this stupid autograph.
[41:24.290 --> 41:25.350]  Watch it be in the pack sack.
[41:25.350 --> 41:25.890]  Watch the pack sack.
[41:26.330 --> 41:26.950]  I mean, here's the thing.
[41:27.030 --> 41:29.270]  If you go through all these and it's not the autograph, you have to go to the pack sack
[41:29.270 --> 41:29.530]  and grab it.
[41:29.550 --> 41:29.810]  It's true.
[41:31.190 --> 41:31.830]  Brian Reynolds.
[41:32.450 --> 41:34.090]  Alex Thomas, refractor.
[41:34.570 --> 41:34.850]  Ooh.
[41:35.570 --> 41:36.250]  Tio Scar Hernandez.
[41:36.470 --> 41:37.330]  That's a pretty card.
[41:38.810 --> 41:41.070]  And then Alexis Diaz, rookie.
[41:41.110 --> 41:42.110]  Do you have that also?
[41:42.190 --> 41:42.850]  But it's in the different...
[41:43.950 --> 41:47.870]  Someone in the chat asked, who would you rather pitch against first?
[41:48.070 --> 41:49.710]  Shohei Otani or Mookie Betts?
[41:49.790 --> 41:51.170]  And I assume Mookie at his highest.
[41:51.910 --> 41:52.730]  Mookie's at his highest.
[41:53.110 --> 41:55.550]  I mean, I was getting him mixed up with the tiger guy.
[41:55.690 --> 41:58.050]  I would probably think Mookie.
[41:58.550 --> 42:00.510]  You don't want to pitch Shohei, he's just going to take a yard.
[42:00.890 --> 42:02.890]  Mookie will put it in play, but he can get out.
[42:03.450 --> 42:05.350]  Mookie's going to hit a really solid single.
[42:07.050 --> 42:07.810]  Shane Bieber.
[42:08.550 --> 42:09.370]  Is that Justin's brother?
[42:09.650 --> 42:10.030]  Yes.
[42:10.110 --> 42:10.550]  His older brother.
[42:11.470 --> 42:13.210]  J.P. Crawford.
[42:14.070 --> 42:14.870]  Jazz regular.
[42:15.250 --> 42:16.050]  And then, here we go.
[42:16.170 --> 42:16.470]  Wow.
[42:16.830 --> 42:17.510]  Jazz regular.
[42:18.070 --> 42:18.710]  Here we go.
[42:20.670 --> 42:22.830]  Not numbered, but Jonathan Arana.
[42:22.850 --> 42:23.190]  Is this the autograph?
[42:23.450 --> 42:24.250]  Ooh, rookie.
[42:24.450 --> 42:24.930]  One more.
[42:25.410 --> 42:25.710]  Cool.
[42:26.190 --> 42:27.130]  Jeopardy! raised.
[42:27.350 --> 42:28.770]  Jeopardy! raised is a good team, huh?
[42:29.310 --> 42:29.710]  Yeah.
[42:30.090 --> 42:35.530]  Everyone in the AL East except the Red Sox and the Yankees are any good, so that's fun.
[42:35.730 --> 42:36.970]  Red Sox and the Yankees aren't good?
[42:37.350 --> 42:38.610]  No, they weren't good last year.
[42:38.690 --> 42:39.150]  No, they weren't.
[42:40.110 --> 42:41.150]  Let's have Juan Soto now.
[42:41.250 --> 42:47.050]  Are you stoked for Juan Soto to win the award for most walks in the league while the Yankees make a cool 85 wins?
[42:47.670 --> 42:48.070]  Yay.
[42:50.110 --> 42:51.010]  I am stoked.
[42:51.390 --> 42:53.950]  I'm stoked to see him return to form.
[42:54.210 --> 42:54.990]  He just wasn't the same.
[42:55.490 --> 42:58.470]  I mean, he's only going to have one year and he's going to go off.
[42:58.490 --> 42:59.430]  Did you see his stupid face?
[42:59.430 --> 43:00.450]  Oh, I missed that.
[43:00.670 --> 43:01.210]  That's cool.
[43:01.470 --> 43:01.850]  Steven Kwan?
[43:01.890 --> 43:02.770]  He's making this noise.
[43:05.390 --> 43:06.110]  That's pretty good.
[43:06.870 --> 43:07.550]  Is this Alan Ginsberg?
[43:07.590 --> 43:08.170]  That's A&G.
[43:08.550 --> 43:10.290]  I don't want to ever go...
[43:10.290 --> 43:11.310]  Emily and I have been...
[43:11.310 --> 43:13.950]  I think I've turned Emily into a legit Alan Ginsberg fan.
[43:13.950 --> 43:15.970]  Well, she wants you to be on an Alan Ginsberg card.
[43:16.290 --> 43:16.810]  I think you should.
[43:16.830 --> 43:17.590]  She just loves her.
[43:17.630 --> 43:19.410]  I just... I don't know what we need to do.
[43:19.730 --> 43:20.310]  Let's see what we got.
[43:20.470 --> 43:22.270]  I need to get an agent, need to get a manager.
[43:24.130 --> 43:26.150]  Michael Harris II up there.
[43:26.610 --> 43:29.030]  Oh, everybody remembers comedian Daniel Van Kirk.
[43:29.870 --> 43:30.230]  Why?
[43:30.350 --> 43:31.850]  Why does he have one and not you?
[43:32.030 --> 43:32.590]  Who are you?
[43:33.550 --> 43:34.530]  Shay Langelier's rookie.
[43:35.250 --> 43:35.970]  Dave Winfield.
[43:36.590 --> 43:37.790]  Oh, he's the co-host on Dumb People Town.
[43:37.790 --> 43:38.870]  I do like that podcast.
[43:39.010 --> 43:42.370]  That Dave Winfield in that Padres jersey, I think is so fucking cool.
[43:42.650 --> 43:43.910]  That is such a great look.
[43:43.930 --> 43:44.530]  That is a great look.
[43:44.910 --> 43:46.610]  Yeah, he was on Upright.
[43:46.670 --> 43:48.950]  Okay, I'll let it go, because I do like Dumb People Town.
[43:49.930 --> 43:51.170]  That's with the Scalar brothers.
[43:51.690 --> 43:52.950]  Oh, you a big Scalar fan?
[43:53.110 --> 43:54.010]  I used to be, yeah.
[43:54.050 --> 43:54.870]  And I listened to that podcast.
[43:54.890 --> 43:56.830]  I don't listen to it anymore, but I did it at a time.
[43:56.950 --> 43:57.270]  It's good.
[43:58.030 --> 43:59.510]  Ryan Nelson, bass rookie.
[44:00.550 --> 44:01.190]  Willie Mays.
[44:01.210 --> 44:01.470]  Nice.
[44:03.770 --> 44:04.410]  George Springer.
[44:05.550 --> 44:07.150]  Corbin Carroll.
[44:08.870 --> 44:10.470]  Tony Gonzalin.
[44:14.250 --> 44:16.390]  He's a pitcher for the Dodgers.
[44:16.730 --> 44:17.370]  Gonzalin?
[44:18.890 --> 44:19.690]  Gonsolin.
[44:19.910 --> 44:20.710]  Gonsolin.
[44:20.970 --> 44:21.130]  Gonsolin.
[44:21.130 --> 44:21.650]  Yeah, Gonsolin.
[44:22.130 --> 44:22.990]  Star pitcher.
[44:23.930 --> 44:24.490]  Wow.
[44:25.170 --> 44:27.870]  We got a new hit we needed.
[44:27.990 --> 44:32.010]  The memorabilia contained in this card is not from any specific year or event.
[44:32.730 --> 44:33.530]  Nice.
[44:33.530 --> 44:34.910]  They just cut up one of his shirts.
[44:35.750 --> 44:36.650]  H-E-R-O is Miami.
[44:36.950 --> 44:37.170]  Hoof.
[44:37.350 --> 44:38.330]  Cabrian Hayes.
[44:38.350 --> 44:38.990]  Hey, all right.
[44:39.870 --> 44:40.750]  Zach Neato.
[44:42.290 --> 44:43.170]  Bryce Young.
[44:43.550 --> 44:45.330]  University of Alabama quarterback.
[44:45.750 --> 44:46.810]  Who does he play for now?
[44:47.310 --> 44:47.990]  Carolina Panthers.
[44:48.470 --> 44:49.370]  Worst team in football.
[44:49.530 --> 44:49.890]  Poor guy.
[44:50.590 --> 44:51.410]  Panther, no Panther.
[44:51.510 --> 44:51.950]  They're not winning.
[44:52.410 --> 44:53.250]  Christian Walker.
[44:54.470 --> 44:55.070]  Oh, here we go.
[44:55.110 --> 44:56.050]  Bun B, the rapper.
[44:56.290 --> 44:56.710]  All right.
[44:56.770 --> 44:57.610]  I'll allow that.
[44:59.230 --> 45:00.110]  Emanuel Clace.
[45:00.310 --> 45:01.010]  And then Emily.
[45:01.530 --> 45:02.990]  Building a sand castle.
[45:02.990 --> 45:04.090]  Fun in the sun.
[45:05.110 --> 45:06.590]  We're going to fill out that fun in the sun.
[45:06.790 --> 45:07.590]  What the fuck?
[45:07.830 --> 45:09.770]  Just the concept of building a sand castle.
[45:09.830 --> 45:10.970]  It's fun in the sun.
[45:11.030 --> 45:11.730]  It's fun in the sun, man.
[45:11.810 --> 45:15.750]  For many, building a sand castle is among the great joys of family trips to the beach.
[45:15.870 --> 45:18.990]  Overcast days are best for construction as cool sand holds moisture better.
[45:19.450 --> 45:24.450]  Properly built sand castles can last four to six months, or at least until that little sibling decides to destroy it.
[45:24.730 --> 45:28.210]  The tallest ever made was in Denmark and stood...
[45:28.210 --> 45:28.870]  How tall do you think?
[45:28.990 --> 45:29.490]  14 feet.
[45:30.730 --> 45:31.310]  19 feet.
[45:31.510 --> 45:31.930]  69.
[45:31.930 --> 45:32.370]  69.
[45:33.210 --> 45:33.510]  Nice.
[45:34.590 --> 45:36.170]  Actor Geofferson White.
[45:36.530 --> 45:36.750]  Okay.
[45:37.030 --> 45:37.110]  Who?
[45:37.330 --> 45:41.530]  Yeah, you'll remember him from the hit series Yellowstone.
[45:41.850 --> 45:48.690]  Playing likable Jimmy Hurdstrom, a once troubled criminal who finds redemption on the ranch.
[45:48.990 --> 45:49.450]  There you go.
[45:49.670 --> 45:51.810]  Yellowstone is just Sons of Anarchy on a cowboy.
[45:52.830 --> 45:53.270]  Wheeler.
[45:54.430 --> 45:54.870]  Bernugo.
[45:55.790 --> 45:56.230]  Clark.
[45:57.690 --> 45:58.570]  David Ortiz.
[46:00.970 --> 46:01.850]  Oswald Pereza.
[46:02.010 --> 46:02.730]  Trevor Story.
[46:03.130 --> 46:04.170]  We'll open up this pack.
[46:04.730 --> 46:05.830]  And that pack will be opened.
[46:06.190 --> 46:07.370]  Who was Alan and Ginter?
[46:08.950 --> 46:11.330]  Two dudes from a long, long, long, long time ago.
[46:11.690 --> 46:12.450]  Two dudes.
[46:13.350 --> 46:16.110]  I love it when you really educate me on stuff.
[46:16.130 --> 46:16.330]  Yeah.
[46:16.850 --> 46:17.710]  Justin Berlander.
[46:17.950 --> 46:18.310]  Shane Bieber.
[46:18.450 --> 46:20.950]  I'll get you an answer and get back to you next week.
[46:21.430 --> 46:21.590]  Okay.
[46:21.590 --> 46:22.930]  Dylan Cease.
[46:23.190 --> 46:25.230]  Gracie, are we doing an episode next week?
[46:25.510 --> 46:25.970]  Andre not.
[46:27.450 --> 46:28.450]  Okay, just making sure.
[46:28.630 --> 46:28.990]  Merlin.
[46:29.010 --> 46:29.650]  We're not doing it the week after.
[46:29.990 --> 46:30.110]  Merlin!
[46:30.490 --> 46:30.970]  We got talent.
[46:31.170 --> 46:32.110]  Oh, talented.
[46:32.250 --> 46:32.530]  We got to say that.
[46:32.770 --> 46:35.470]  We're not doing one the week after next because it's Christmas Day.
[46:35.590 --> 46:35.790]  Uh-huh.
[46:35.950 --> 46:37.930]  And then the week after that is New Year's Day.
[46:38.170 --> 46:38.530]  Oh.
[46:38.970 --> 46:39.330]  So...
[46:39.330 --> 46:40.990]  Oh, it's quiet on New Year's Day.
[46:41.470 --> 46:41.770]  Yeah.
[46:46.230 --> 46:47.090]  What you got, Geoff?
[46:47.450 --> 46:48.490]  I was just laughing at you.
[46:48.590 --> 46:49.190]  Thank you.
[46:49.370 --> 46:49.870]  That was funny.
[46:50.530 --> 46:51.690]  Uh, fuck it.
[46:51.730 --> 46:52.050]  I don't know.
[46:52.090 --> 46:52.870]  Let's open up some of this.
[46:52.990 --> 46:54.010]  Let's open up some mosaic.
[46:54.890 --> 46:55.530]  Oh, nice.
[46:58.370 --> 46:59.490]  Just right on the ground.
[46:59.810 --> 47:00.210]  There you go.
[47:00.590 --> 47:01.290]  I'm gonna save it.
[47:01.850 --> 47:02.170]  Why?
[47:02.190 --> 47:02.570]  What's this?
[47:02.690 --> 47:03.370]  You're gonna save it?
[47:03.390 --> 47:04.570]  I'm gonna build a house out of all the boxes.
[47:05.510 --> 47:05.830]  Yeah.
[47:05.970 --> 47:06.690]  What the fuck?
[47:06.850 --> 47:07.250]  I've been...
[47:07.250 --> 47:07.830]  Yeah.
[47:07.910 --> 47:08.890]  Don't go to our storage shed.
[47:08.950 --> 47:09.830]  Don't go to our storage shed.
[47:09.910 --> 47:11.930]  It's Christmas and old sports boxes.
[47:12.010 --> 47:14.610]  I'm gonna make Gus go to your storage shred.
[47:14.950 --> 47:15.790]  And he's gonna be so mad.
[47:16.010 --> 47:17.350]  He can come help us load up our Christmas stuff.
[47:17.350 --> 47:18.530]  He's not gonna help you with anything.
[47:18.610 --> 47:19.530]  He's gonna judge you.
[47:19.530 --> 47:20.270]  That's fine.
[47:20.290 --> 47:21.150]  Rui Hachimura.
[47:21.490 --> 47:21.830]  Rui Hachimura.
[47:22.670 --> 47:23.590]  Tyrese Martin.
[47:23.990 --> 47:24.350]  Ooh.
[47:24.810 --> 47:25.790]  I like Rui Go Bear.
[47:25.930 --> 47:26.130]  Look at him.
[47:26.590 --> 47:27.610]  Give him a headlock.
[47:27.950 --> 47:30.270]  Are we gonna do the football after this?
[47:30.670 --> 47:31.130]  The football?
[47:31.230 --> 47:31.490]  Yeah.
[47:31.590 --> 47:31.750]  Yeah.
[47:31.950 --> 47:32.390]  Oh, wow.
[47:32.550 --> 47:33.510]  This is...
[47:33.510 --> 47:34.370]  We're getting there.
[47:34.770 --> 47:35.130]  Exciting.
[47:35.230 --> 47:35.870]  One or two more things.
[47:36.130 --> 47:37.670]  What other football...
[47:37.670 --> 47:38.410]  I know what we're doing.
[47:38.430 --> 47:38.650]  Bam.
[47:39.430 --> 47:40.730]  What other football...
[47:40.730 --> 47:41.110]  Pat.
[47:41.890 --> 47:42.170]  Bam.
[47:42.610 --> 47:43.110]  What other football?
[47:43.230 --> 47:44.870]  Who else would have signed like a football?
[47:44.930 --> 47:46.730]  Who's the guy at the baseball bat that you're like,
[47:46.810 --> 47:47.810]  cool, everybody has that.
[47:47.810 --> 47:48.390]  Pete Rose.
[47:48.390 --> 47:48.810]  Pete Rose.
[47:49.090 --> 47:50.690]  Who's the football version of Pete Rose?
[47:50.810 --> 47:51.710]  I don't know that there is one.
[47:51.750 --> 47:52.190]  Jim Kelly.
[47:52.390 --> 47:52.890]  I guess.
[47:53.110 --> 47:53.770]  Somebody like that.
[47:54.130 --> 47:55.290]  What if it's a Terry Bradshaw?
[47:55.650 --> 47:57.370]  I hope it's Pete Rose signing a football.
[47:58.130 --> 47:58.550]  Did he play football?
[47:58.550 --> 47:58.990]  That would be good.
[47:59.110 --> 47:59.290]  No.
[47:59.750 --> 48:00.830]  We should start a collection.
[48:01.510 --> 48:05.170]  We should start a collection of athletes signing the wrong gear.
[48:05.570 --> 48:05.690]  Yeah.
[48:05.850 --> 48:06.350]  It's a good idea.
[48:07.950 --> 48:08.690]  Donovan Mitchell.
[48:09.770 --> 48:10.170]  SGA.
[48:10.990 --> 48:11.790]  RJ Barrett.
[48:12.490 --> 48:13.290]  McCall Bridges.
[48:13.550 --> 48:13.790]  Brandon Clark.
[48:13.790 --> 48:14.470]  Do you think that they would?
[48:14.570 --> 48:15.230]  Russell Westbrook.
[48:15.250 --> 48:15.530]  Oh, yeah.
[48:15.530 --> 48:20.110]  We should send my niece or nephew down to the end of the thing to be like,
[48:20.190 --> 48:21.430]  hey, can you sign this for me?
[48:21.510 --> 48:23.590]  And then they make a basketball player sign a football.
[48:23.750 --> 48:23.890]  Yeah.
[48:24.050 --> 48:24.550]  That is a good idea.
[48:24.690 --> 48:25.030]  What you got?
[48:25.710 --> 48:26.430]  Jalen Williams.
[48:26.570 --> 48:27.590]  Purple fast break.
[48:27.590 --> 48:27.710]  Nice.
[48:28.230 --> 48:29.610]  He looks insane in that picture.
[48:29.750 --> 48:30.030]  That's cool.
[48:30.610 --> 48:32.330]  This sucker's numbered...
[48:32.330 --> 48:32.890]  Oh, wow.
[48:33.970 --> 48:34.850]  Eight of 50.
[48:35.030 --> 48:35.350]  Ooh.
[48:35.630 --> 48:35.790]  Ooh.
[48:36.850 --> 48:37.190]  That's a good one.
[48:37.410 --> 48:38.930]  That might be worth something.
[48:39.070 --> 48:39.230]  Yeah.
[48:39.330 --> 48:40.410]  That's actually a really, really good card.
[48:41.230 --> 48:41.910]  Johnny Davis.
[48:42.050 --> 48:42.610]  Jaden Ivey.
[48:42.970 --> 48:44.130]  And Mac McClung.
[48:44.130 --> 48:46.490]  NBA dunk champion, Mac McClung.
[48:47.010 --> 48:47.530]  When's that?
[48:47.630 --> 48:48.510]  When's the dunk contest?
[48:49.010 --> 48:50.490]  It'll be in March.
[48:50.750 --> 48:50.850]  Yeah.
[48:51.150 --> 48:54.810]  I guess the interseason tournament got me all mixed up from thinking, like...
[48:54.890 --> 48:56.950]  Apparently, huge, huge success.
[48:57.530 --> 48:58.850]  I feel like the season's later.
[48:58.850 --> 48:59.910]  I peaced the fuck out when the Celtics lost.
[48:59.910 --> 49:03.070]  The only thing that I was so-so on is the insane courts.
[49:03.530 --> 49:03.930]  Killian.
[49:04.050 --> 49:05.650]  They just need to be less insane, that's all.
[49:05.870 --> 49:06.070]  Yeah.
[49:06.110 --> 49:06.310]  Moses.
[49:07.230 --> 49:07.430]  Aaron.
[49:07.430 --> 49:09.030]  I feel like you're playing on, like, the Boise State football team.
[49:09.030 --> 49:09.690]  Yeah, right?
[49:09.790 --> 49:12.890]  It's, like, playing it, like, in Chicago is, like, fucking insane looking.
[49:12.890 --> 49:14.730]  Jakob Pirtle, fast break.
[49:14.950 --> 49:15.250]  Oh, nice.
[49:15.690 --> 49:16.950]  Kenny Chandler, rookie.
[49:17.530 --> 49:19.710]  Christian Coloco and De'Aaron Fox.
[49:19.930 --> 49:20.070]  Nice.
[49:20.110 --> 49:23.170]  Boy, what a disappointment the Sacramento Kings have been so far this year.
[49:23.170 --> 49:23.550]  Absolutely.
[49:24.230 --> 49:26.510]  All right, we got ten minutes left.
[49:26.510 --> 49:29.290]  Didn't they beat someone, though, in the season tournament?
[49:33.170 --> 49:34.130]  They lost...
[49:34.130 --> 49:34.830]  I picked the...
[49:34.830 --> 49:36.070]  They lost the first round.
[49:36.350 --> 49:36.490]  Oh, sorry.
[49:37.110 --> 49:37.330]  Yeah.
[49:38.690 --> 49:39.630]  Did they tear it up?
[49:39.690 --> 49:39.910]  No.
[49:40.210 --> 49:40.610]  Oh!
[49:40.930 --> 49:42.090]  Did they light that beam?
[49:43.730 --> 49:45.550]  I got almost...
[49:45.550 --> 49:45.970]  Out of the...
[49:45.970 --> 49:46.630]  We did a bracket.
[49:46.850 --> 49:48.010]  I only got one game right.
[49:48.090 --> 49:49.010]  Jesus Christ.
[49:49.090 --> 49:50.550]  I got that the Bucks beat the Knicks.
[49:50.710 --> 49:51.430]  Big fucking surprise.
[49:51.430 --> 49:54.150]  I got the Lakers on the side, but I...
[49:54.150 --> 49:55.790]  One of the Celtics to beat the Lakers.
[49:57.430 --> 49:59.030]  Well, that's because you're a true American.
[49:59.250 --> 49:59.450]  Yeah.
[49:59.610 --> 50:00.090]  Yeah, of course.
[50:00.130 --> 50:00.550]  Let's go Lakers.
[50:00.790 --> 50:01.190]  Leaf.
[50:01.590 --> 50:02.850]  Everybody remembers...
[50:02.850 --> 50:03.370]  Guys!
[50:04.690 --> 50:05.570]  Fucking Leaf!
[50:05.810 --> 50:06.250]  Classic!
[50:06.930 --> 50:07.370]  Oathbreaker.
[50:09.590 --> 50:10.030]  Oathbreaker.
[50:10.570 --> 50:10.870]  Okay.
[50:10.870 --> 50:13.490]  It's amazing how I remember nothing from the show...
[50:13.810 --> 50:14.850]  ...but absorbed all of it.
[50:14.850 --> 50:15.810]  No idea who that is.
[50:15.970 --> 50:16.730]  Seen the show.
[50:16.830 --> 50:17.610]  Seen every episode.
[50:18.110 --> 50:18.930]  Ellaria Sand.
[50:19.230 --> 50:20.470]  Oh, she was a serpent lady.
[50:20.710 --> 50:26.090]  It is as if we all collectively flushed our brains at the same time.
[50:26.150 --> 50:28.370]  But I remember enjoying it mostly.
[50:28.970 --> 50:30.910]  I've read all the novels, dude.
[50:30.970 --> 50:31.150]  Yeah.
[50:31.590 --> 50:33.030]  I'm deep into that shit.
[50:33.150 --> 50:33.470]  Weird.
[50:33.690 --> 50:34.930]  I guess you just go like, nah, okay.
[50:35.150 --> 50:35.330]  Yeah.
[50:35.530 --> 50:35.930]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[50:36.110 --> 50:38.210]  The first season was really spectacular.
[50:38.290 --> 50:39.010]  Really lackluster.
[50:39.570 --> 50:40.410]  Oh, shit, dude.
[50:40.410 --> 50:41.430]  Did we get another hit?
[50:41.910 --> 50:42.190]  What you got?
[50:42.270 --> 50:42.470]  What you got?
[50:42.510 --> 50:42.730]  What you got?
[50:42.730 --> 50:43.690]  We got another fucking...
[50:43.690 --> 50:44.670]  Hit me with it, baby, let's go!
[50:44.750 --> 50:45.930]  Run it through and then show me the hit!
[50:46.170 --> 50:47.270]  Edison Tullet.
[50:47.450 --> 50:47.990]  Oh, wow!
[50:47.990 --> 50:48.610]  That's cool.
[50:48.670 --> 50:48.990]  Edison.
[50:49.310 --> 50:49.590]  Toilet.
[50:51.910 --> 50:52.350]  Oathbreaker.
[50:52.750 --> 50:52.950]  Oh!
[50:54.090 --> 50:54.970]  Bruce Bolton.
[50:55.410 --> 50:55.990]  Oh, wow.
[50:56.550 --> 50:58.230]  The Broken Man.
[50:58.530 --> 51:01.430]  And then an autograph from...
[51:01.430 --> 51:04.530]  This limited edition autograph has been personally signed by...
[51:04.530 --> 51:06.970]  Sir Brendan Tully himself, Clive Russell.
[51:07.310 --> 51:07.390]  Hey!
[51:08.490 --> 51:09.010]  That's pretty cool.
[51:09.010 --> 51:09.450]  Okay.
[51:09.470 --> 51:10.110]  That is it.
[51:10.110 --> 51:11.370]  Is that on card or is it sticker?
[51:11.450 --> 51:12.330]  Oh, that's on card, all right.
[51:12.370 --> 51:12.690]  Wow.
[51:12.850 --> 51:14.750]  So, who are you?
[51:15.330 --> 51:16.210]  We have two...
[51:16.210 --> 51:17.650]  You got a lot of Game of Thrones autographs.
[51:17.650 --> 51:21.090]  As Sir Bryden Tully.
[51:21.810 --> 51:22.170]  Yeah.
[51:23.190 --> 51:24.350]  That is a...
[51:24.710 --> 51:25.430]  That's a squiggle.
[51:26.270 --> 51:27.050]  That's a squiggle.
[51:27.190 --> 51:27.790]  That's a squiggle.
[51:28.790 --> 51:29.450]  That's a squiggle.
[51:31.230 --> 51:33.030]  Oh, hey, before you do that, can you open these?
[51:34.310 --> 51:35.010]  Oh, sorry.
[51:35.090 --> 51:35.930]  Star Wars Revenge of the Sith.
[51:36.010 --> 51:36.150]  Yeah.
[51:36.430 --> 51:37.450]  Is that your favorite Star Wars?
[51:37.450 --> 51:39.530]  Yeah, guys, I love Revenge of the Sith.
[51:39.970 --> 51:42.690]  I think of all of them and I go, ooh, Revenge of the Sith.
[51:42.870 --> 51:44.930]  All my favorite moments.
[51:45.170 --> 51:45.730]  Name three.
[51:46.110 --> 51:46.370]  Sith.
[51:47.110 --> 51:49.090]  Is Revenge of the Sith the third one?
[51:49.290 --> 51:49.790]  I believe so.
[51:50.550 --> 51:51.970]  I love it when they get revenge.
[51:52.390 --> 51:53.410]  I love it when the Sith...
[51:53.410 --> 51:53.430]  Darth Vader.
[51:53.430 --> 51:54.170]  There's Darth Vader.
[51:54.430 --> 51:55.470]  She died of a broken heart.
[51:56.610 --> 51:57.370]  Is that what he says?
[51:58.170 --> 51:59.090]  Something like that, yeah.
[51:59.250 --> 52:00.410]  Jedi to Sith.
[52:00.570 --> 52:00.810]  Cool.
[52:01.330 --> 52:02.450]  Count Dooku's execution.
[52:02.450 --> 52:03.470]  Hell yeah, that part's cool.
[52:03.470 --> 52:04.090]  Count Dooku.
[52:05.670 --> 52:06.070]  Dooku.
[52:06.310 --> 52:06.570]  Uh-huh.
[52:06.570 --> 52:08.370]  This is a piece of a...
[52:09.250 --> 52:09.690]  Dookie.
[52:10.210 --> 52:10.990]  Oh, here we go.
[52:11.090 --> 52:12.250]  This is a Jedi sticker.
[52:12.370 --> 52:12.570]  Okay.
[52:12.990 --> 52:13.430]  Cool.
[52:13.970 --> 52:14.990]  I think Gracie's gonna love that.
[52:15.010 --> 52:15.690]  General Grievous.
[52:15.730 --> 52:15.990]  Uh-huh.
[52:16.310 --> 52:16.530]  Cry.
[52:16.890 --> 52:18.070]  Planet of the Wookiees.
[52:18.090 --> 52:18.450]  Whee!
[52:19.030 --> 52:20.650]  These movies suck shit.
[52:21.550 --> 52:22.410]  Facing an old enemy.
[52:22.690 --> 52:23.530]  These suck!
[52:23.770 --> 52:24.970]  This movie sucks!
[52:25.110 --> 52:27.290]  Yeah, I love that sexy Darth Vader.
[52:27.290 --> 52:28.230]  The Christmas movie came...
[52:28.230 --> 52:29.470]  The Christmas draft came out, right?
[52:30.010 --> 52:31.250]  The Christmas movie draft?
[52:31.850 --> 52:33.570]  And nobody did the Christmas...
[52:34.310 --> 52:35.050]  Star Wars Christmas special?
[52:35.430 --> 52:36.330]  You have to watch to find out.
[52:36.330 --> 52:37.510]  Why would they pick that?
[52:37.730 --> 52:38.470]  Because it sucks.
[52:38.830 --> 52:39.390]  It does suck.
[52:39.450 --> 52:40.090]  That's why we picked the best ones.
[52:40.090 --> 52:41.210]  We only picked good movies.
[52:41.290 --> 52:41.670]  You...
[52:41.670 --> 52:41.970]  I...
[52:41.970 --> 52:43.250]  I was really...
[52:43.250 --> 52:44.330]  I loved your picks.
[52:45.010 --> 52:45.790]  I saw...
[52:45.790 --> 52:46.170]  Yours were the best.
[52:46.170 --> 52:47.350]  Everyone loved your picks.
[52:47.490 --> 52:51.510]  I saw one person so mad that you did...
[52:51.510 --> 52:52.750]  Geoff did a bit!
[52:53.650 --> 52:55.870]  We did a bit in a comedy podcast!
[52:56.070 --> 52:56.730]  What a dick!
[52:57.090 --> 52:58.350]  It was so funny.
[52:58.350 --> 52:59.870]  Why was Geoff funny?
[53:00.030 --> 53:00.770]  It truly...
[53:00.770 --> 53:03.370]  It truly made me laugh because everyone loved it.
[53:03.870 --> 53:06.110]  It was such a fun...
[53:06.110 --> 53:08.030]  You being the last pick...
[53:08.270 --> 53:12.090]  ...to do your thing, and then you get the next pick, and you continue the bit.
[53:12.210 --> 53:12.950]  And we knew where...
[53:12.950 --> 53:13.770]  It was like, this is great.
[53:13.970 --> 53:14.850]  This is so funny.
[53:15.050 --> 53:15.470]  You're so good.
[53:15.570 --> 53:15.970]  It was great.
[53:16.250 --> 53:16.990]  Yeah, you know.
[53:17.130 --> 53:17.670]  Okay, who do you...
[53:18.970 --> 53:19.990]  What do you think?
[53:21.090 --> 53:21.430]  Ah.
[53:21.990 --> 53:22.670]  Dion Sanders.
[53:23.030 --> 53:23.290]  Wow.
[53:24.050 --> 53:24.450]  Uh...
[53:24.450 --> 53:25.410]  I'm gonna say Travis Kelce.
[53:25.710 --> 53:25.910]  Oh!
[53:26.850 --> 53:27.430]  All right.
[53:28.030 --> 53:29.670]  I'm gonna see if there's like a...
[53:29.670 --> 53:30.530]  Let me check the box.
[53:30.530 --> 53:30.770]  Yeah, you check the box.
[53:30.770 --> 53:31.490]  In case it's weird.
[53:31.890 --> 53:32.930]  In case it's weird.
[53:33.070 --> 53:34.110]  It might not...
[53:34.110 --> 53:35.070]  Oh, it smells like...
[53:35.070 --> 53:36.770]  It smells like an academy.
[53:37.310 --> 53:38.270]  You already know who it is?
[53:38.350 --> 53:40.890]  There's a sticker on here, but you guys are gonna have to probably look at the signature
[53:40.890 --> 53:42.110]  and try to figure out what it is.
[53:42.170 --> 53:42.310]  Okay.
[53:42.690 --> 53:43.510]  All right, here we go, Geoff.
[53:44.230 --> 53:46.230]  No, you have to open it on the camera!
[53:46.350 --> 53:46.750]  What are you doing?
[53:46.770 --> 53:47.470]  It's the whole show!
[53:49.570 --> 53:50.990]  All right, it's a Seattle Seahawk.
[53:51.070 --> 53:51.350]  Uh-huh.
[53:51.590 --> 53:52.270]  Number 16.
[53:52.450 --> 53:53.890]  Your thumb is right where the signature is.
[53:54.290 --> 53:54.870]  There you go.
[53:56.630 --> 53:57.270]  It is...
[53:58.170 --> 53:58.490]  Uh...
[53:59.850 --> 54:01.070]  Who plays for the Sup...
[54:02.550 --> 54:02.870]  Uh...
[54:02.870 --> 54:03.170]  Uh...
[54:03.170 --> 54:03.710]  Is it...
[54:03.710 --> 54:05.390]  CJ Stroud?
[54:06.090 --> 54:07.350]  It's a wide receiver.
[54:07.590 --> 54:07.890]  Okay.
[54:08.070 --> 54:09.890]  His name is...
[54:09.890 --> 54:11.510]  Tyler Lockett.
[54:11.790 --> 54:12.730]  Oh, Tyler Lockett!
[54:12.850 --> 54:13.030]  That's neat!
[54:13.150 --> 54:13.630]  Oh, okay!
[54:13.850 --> 54:18.250]  He played football with Kansas State and he joined them in the 2015 NFL Draft.
[54:18.610 --> 54:18.870]  Yeah.
[54:19.070 --> 54:19.710]  He is...
[54:21.050 --> 54:22.930]  He looks like he's nice.
[54:22.970 --> 54:23.810]  Wow, these are...
[54:23.810 --> 54:30.010]  Both a 2011 All-American as a kickoff returner and 2014 college football All-America team.
[54:30.730 --> 54:32.010]  He's a punt returner.
[54:32.010 --> 54:37.390]  In college, he totaled 6,586 career all-purpose yards and 35 touchdowns included.
[54:37.550 --> 54:38.390]  This is all college stats.
[54:38.530 --> 54:40.490]  I will say that this is, like...
[54:40.490 --> 54:42.150]  That signature is super clean.
[54:42.290 --> 54:42.510]  Yeah.
[54:42.670 --> 54:47.470]  Like, usually on something white like this and, you know, you're signing so many of them,
[54:47.590 --> 54:49.670]  it can get smudgy, it can get kind of fucked.
[54:49.670 --> 54:49.870]  Not at all.
[54:50.030 --> 54:51.430]  That looks fantastic.
[54:51.790 --> 54:52.590]  Also, you probably...
[54:52.590 --> 54:55.650]  I don't know if you can tell, but the Seahawks logo is embroidered.
[54:55.670 --> 54:57.430]  It's, like, raised slightly.
[54:57.810 --> 55:00.330]  It feels like, what, jersey material?
[55:00.510 --> 55:00.730]  Yeah.
[55:00.730 --> 55:01.890]  It's very cool.
[55:02.010 --> 55:04.590]  So, he was in the NFL draft in 2015.
[55:05.010 --> 55:07.330]  He was picked in round three.
[55:07.730 --> 55:09.390]  What number do you think he was picked?
[55:10.530 --> 55:10.810]  Eight.
[55:10.850 --> 55:11.390]  Sixty-nine.
[55:11.530 --> 55:12.030]  Sixty-nine.
[55:12.230 --> 55:12.450]  Really?
[55:12.930 --> 55:13.450]  Nice.
[55:13.630 --> 55:14.810]  I mean, you gotta know where she's going with that.
[55:14.850 --> 55:15.370]  That's awesome.
[55:16.750 --> 55:17.270]  He...
[55:17.270 --> 55:19.770]  First team All-Pro Bowl...
[55:19.770 --> 55:20.570]  Good for you.
[55:21.110 --> 55:22.390]  That's a good pickup, man.
[55:22.410 --> 55:22.570]  Reception...
[55:22.570 --> 55:24.510]  Okay, so his receptions are 598.
[55:25.130 --> 55:27.170]  Receiving yards, 7,800.
[55:27.970 --> 55:29.410]  Receiving touchdowns, 58.
[55:29.410 --> 55:32.810]  Geoff, do you think that's probably getting in your shot there?
[55:34.310 --> 55:36.350]  No, it just covers up his fucked-up logo.
[55:36.730 --> 55:37.490]  And then go to the wide?
[55:39.210 --> 55:39.570]  Ayy.
[55:40.950 --> 55:41.670]  I mean...
[55:41.670 --> 55:42.190]  I love it.
[55:42.350 --> 55:42.470]  Cool.
[55:42.990 --> 55:44.690]  That way it's in the center frame, everybody can see it.
[55:44.890 --> 55:44.950]  Uh-huh.
[55:45.170 --> 55:47.610]  I'm just gonna open up these fucking, uh...
[55:47.610 --> 55:49.730]  I think this is, like...
[55:49.730 --> 55:51.390]  Is this Japanese optic?
[55:51.790 --> 55:52.150]  What?
[55:52.330 --> 55:52.610]  What?
[55:52.790 --> 55:53.650]  What did you get?
[55:53.670 --> 55:54.250]  Where'd you get that from?
[55:54.930 --> 55:55.930]  Uh, I bought it online.
[55:56.090 --> 55:58.350]  I can't remember if I got, like, T-ball optic.
[55:58.890 --> 55:59.610]  Yeah, I can't remember.
[55:59.610 --> 56:00.270]  Oh, what the fuck?
[56:00.630 --> 56:02.130]  I can't remember if it's T-ball or not, but let's see.
[56:02.250 --> 56:02.650]  How weird.
[56:02.970 --> 56:03.710]  What does that say?
[56:03.810 --> 56:05.350]  If anybody in the chat knows what that says...
[56:05.990 --> 56:06.650]  Probably says Panini.
[56:07.190 --> 56:07.670]  You think so?
[56:07.750 --> 56:07.970]  Yeah.
[56:08.210 --> 56:08.490]  Oh.
[56:09.890 --> 56:12.290]  Anyway, I'll open up these to walk us out.
[56:12.410 --> 56:13.850]  I bought this on Black Friday.
[56:13.990 --> 56:14.310]  It was on sale.
[56:14.470 --> 56:14.670]  Neat.
[56:15.490 --> 56:18.430]  Max Strews, Jake Laravia, Kawhi, and Draymond.
[56:19.330 --> 56:19.930]  Oh, nice.
[56:20.870 --> 56:22.350]  And, hey, thanks for submitting...
[56:22.950 --> 56:25.070]  Or sending in all that stuff that we got to open up today.
[56:25.170 --> 56:25.670]  It was really fun.
[56:25.710 --> 56:28.150]  It was humbling to be able to open up the...
[56:29.310 --> 56:31.010]  The face-off cards.
[56:31.170 --> 56:31.890]  That was amazing.
[56:31.890 --> 56:32.290]  That was so cool.
[56:32.450 --> 56:34.190]  I'm gonna wear this hat for the rest of my life.
[56:34.270 --> 56:34.910]  Thank you so much.
[56:35.010 --> 56:35.550]  What's that pink box?
[56:36.230 --> 56:37.590]  Love all the cards we got.
[56:37.670 --> 56:38.650]  We got this pink box.
[56:38.850 --> 56:39.490]  Is that not yours?
[56:39.950 --> 56:40.210]  No.
[56:40.630 --> 56:40.950]  Oh.
[56:41.110 --> 56:41.550]  It's probably mail.
[56:42.170 --> 56:42.570]  Oh, my God.
[56:42.570 --> 56:43.750]  We didn't get to all the mail.
[56:43.750 --> 56:45.150]  No, no, we have so much more mail.
[56:45.390 --> 56:45.670]  Let's get back to it.
[56:46.170 --> 56:46.950]  There's so much more mail.
[56:47.310 --> 56:49.150]  Harrison Barnes, Alec Burks.
[56:49.790 --> 56:50.370]  Oh, here we go.
[56:50.430 --> 56:51.070]  This is nice.
[56:51.170 --> 56:53.930]  This is a Tyrese Martin Red Wave rookie.
[56:54.890 --> 56:55.610]  Malik Beasley.
[56:56.270 --> 56:57.350]  Anyway, we really appreciate it.
[56:57.350 --> 56:58.170]  We hope you had a good year.
[56:58.250 --> 56:59.570]  Thanks for spending...
[56:59.570 --> 57:00.670]  This isn't our last episode of the year.
[57:00.750 --> 57:01.850]  No, it's certainly not.
[57:01.930 --> 57:03.710]  We talked about doing another one next year.
[57:03.770 --> 57:03.990]  Yeah.
[57:04.110 --> 57:04.970]  Or next week.
[57:05.110 --> 57:05.830]  And we're gonna do that.
[57:05.950 --> 57:07.230]  And hopefully you'll be here for us.
[57:07.450 --> 57:09.090]  But if not, with us what?
[57:09.450 --> 57:10.070]  Josh Richardson.
[57:10.430 --> 57:10.910]  Oh, here we go.
[57:10.950 --> 57:11.710]  Palo rookie, basically.
[57:11.710 --> 57:13.190]  New Beanhole video came out this week.
[57:13.190 --> 57:13.850]  Kevin Herter.
[57:15.150 --> 57:15.790]  Robert Williams.
[57:16.350 --> 57:17.410]  Are there still pens available?
[57:17.950 --> 57:18.270]  Absolutely.
[57:18.810 --> 57:18.950]  Yeah.
[57:19.030 --> 57:19.330]  Oh, yeah.
[57:19.330 --> 57:20.830]  Buy them at IrishTeeth.com.
[57:20.890 --> 57:22.810]  You can pick up one of these Beanhole Dirt pens.
[57:23.010 --> 57:23.690]  Filled with dirt.
[57:23.890 --> 57:24.970]  From Geoff and Emily's backyard.
[57:25.250 --> 57:26.490]  And some of them have cards in them.
[57:26.490 --> 57:26.750]  Yep.
[57:26.770 --> 57:28.430]  And then watch the video to see if you see your dirt.
[57:28.630 --> 57:29.770]  Victor Oladipo.
[57:29.830 --> 57:30.850]  Here's a useless...
[57:30.850 --> 57:32.110]  It's not pee dirt.
[57:32.430 --> 57:33.130]  That's what you think.
[57:33.150 --> 57:33.810]  Malcolm Brogdon.
[57:33.850 --> 57:36.030]  That one person wanted to be pee dirt so fucking bad.
[57:36.130 --> 57:40.590]  There was a pee spot in our backyard from where Henry peed every single time.
[57:40.730 --> 57:43.490]  That is only, you know, over one year later.
[57:43.650 --> 57:43.910]  Couldn't be further away from that.
[57:43.910 --> 57:44.150]  Oh, yeah.
[57:44.190 --> 57:46.710]  It was the complete opposite side of the yard because he was not walking all the way back there.
[57:48.930 --> 57:51.690]  If you want pee dirt, I could probably get you some from there.
[57:52.270 --> 57:52.390]  Yeah.
[57:53.070 --> 57:54.270]  Dead Dog Pee Dirt.
[57:54.490 --> 57:55.030]  Hey, we're smart.
[57:55.310 --> 57:55.930]  Wrong team, man.
[57:55.930 --> 57:57.070]  Yeah, I know.

[58:01.850 --> 58:02.750]  He looks even better when he's not hurt.
[58:02.990 --> 58:10.230]  Uh, Rashaun Holmes, Devin Booker, Jaden Ivey, the Rookeries, uh, Laurie Markinan.

[58:12.070 --> 58:13.610]  Not having the year he had last year.
[58:13.650 --> 58:13.870]  No.
[58:14.290 --> 58:15.050]  I think it may be her.
[58:15.050 --> 58:17.170]  What, uh, Let's Plays do you guys have coming out this week?
