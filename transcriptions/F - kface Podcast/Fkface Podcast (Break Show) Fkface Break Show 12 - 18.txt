[00:07.500 --> 00:13.840]  Hello and welcome to the most controversial episode of the Face Break Show we've ever had.
[00:14.000 --> 00:19.880]  I don't know that we should get into it. I don't know if we save that for a podcast conversation.
[00:20.240 --> 00:21.780]  But it's deeply contentious.
[00:21.800 --> 00:28.480]  And I can't wait the many weeks that it's going to be. Also, we made it one month of marriage, but I think Gavin is coming between us.
[00:28.820 --> 00:34.280]  Gavin and I agree, and Emily and Gracie agree, on a scientific principle.
[00:34.760 --> 00:38.580]  Like, I get it, but I don't. But then now I do feel like my brain is breaking.
[00:38.800 --> 00:43.200]  And I need someone who's like, I have a physics master to explain it to me.
[00:43.240 --> 00:43.880]  You can put it to the chat.
[00:44.440 --> 00:46.840]  I need the chat to solve this problem.
[00:47.120 --> 00:49.540]  Do you... do we wanna... you wanna... I can get into it.
[00:50.020 --> 00:50.980]  Now this is a... also...
[00:50.980 --> 00:52.420]  Use our... use these.
[00:52.460 --> 00:56.580]  Welcome to the Break Show. My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, my wife Emily and my best friend Gavin.
[00:57.140 --> 01:01.640]  This is the last one of the year, so we're gonna have a huge blowout episode.
[01:02.280 --> 01:03.740]  We're gonna open up tons of fun stuff.
[01:03.740 --> 01:08.760]  Do you guys remember when we got our one-of-one Julius Caesar card?
[01:08.940 --> 01:10.280]  Ooh, there it is right there.
[01:12.900 --> 01:14.460]  There it is. Right there.
[01:14.920 --> 01:18.920]  Well, Gracie was so kind as to go out and buy three more boxes.
[01:19.380 --> 01:21.540]  So we're gonna see if we can get some other old dead people.
[01:21.640 --> 01:22.660]  Is it all ancient shit?
[01:22.840 --> 01:25.020]  It's all historical stuff, yeah.
[01:25.820 --> 01:29.100]  We're gonna also... the piece de resistance, the last thing we're gonna open up.
[01:29.120 --> 01:31.140]  We've never done this before. We're gonna open up a box of shoes.
[01:32.120 --> 01:36.280]  Stinky shoes, maybe by a dead celebrity.
[01:37.060 --> 01:38.160]  Athlete, we don't know. We'll see.
[01:38.420 --> 01:42.500]  Okay, but the first thing we're gonna do is, as you know, at the beginning of every episode...
[01:42.500 --> 01:47.000]  As I'm sure you know, at the beginning of every episode, I did...
[01:47.000 --> 01:50.300]  It was a wrapped Christmas present, Mom.
[01:50.640 --> 01:52.020]  Oh, you're texting your mother right now?
[01:52.220 --> 01:54.420]  She said, did you send me a neck massager?
[01:54.580 --> 01:56.440]  I'm like, yeah, it was wrapped, and it said Merry Christmas.
[01:56.980 --> 01:58.000]  It had a gift thing.
[01:58.140 --> 01:58.980]  Did it say from you, though?
[01:58.980 --> 02:01.780]  Yes! It was addressed to me!
[02:01.920 --> 02:05.920]  Amazon will wrap things up for you, so she said, instead of waiting for you all to get there.
[02:06.340 --> 02:08.020]  Yeah, anyway, Merry early Christmas.
[02:08.200 --> 02:08.880]  Merry Christmas!
[02:11.020 --> 02:16.160]  We like to look over the hits from the previous week, and I grade them, and I tell you how much they're worth.
[02:16.240 --> 02:17.440]  Based on soul value.
[02:17.500 --> 02:19.500]  We were busy arguing before getting ready for this show.
[02:19.900 --> 02:25.680]  So, first card. This Wim Binyama Prism Draft Picks card.
[02:25.740 --> 02:26.440]  What do you think it is?
[02:26.920 --> 02:29.320]  Gavin, you have to guess how much money you think this card is worth.
[02:30.680 --> 02:32.160]  What's the range of prices?
[02:32.260 --> 02:33.180]  I don't know, could be anything.
[02:33.200 --> 02:34.440]  I would guess $120.
[02:34.840 --> 02:35.500]  I'll take the under.
[02:36.260 --> 02:37.540]  That card right there, $60.
[02:37.900 --> 02:38.100]  Wow!
[02:38.400 --> 02:44.420]  If you have this fucking Victor Wim Binyama Prism Draft card, sell it yesterday.
[02:44.720 --> 02:47.000]  It's not gonna be worth $6 in a year.
[02:47.100 --> 02:48.440]  Is it graded the one you looked at?
[02:49.120 --> 02:49.880]  No, they're wrong.
[02:50.180 --> 02:50.860]  Let's just sell it.
[02:50.880 --> 02:51.580]  Is he at a bad time?
[02:52.000 --> 02:53.440]  No, he's fine, but it's...
[02:54.120 --> 02:56.260]  So, Prism is the kind of card you want.
[02:56.880 --> 02:58.820]  Prism Draft Picks, nobody gives a shit about.
[02:59.060 --> 03:00.420]  It's like him in his college uniform.
[03:01.460 --> 03:03.260]  Yeah, in this case, he's not wearing...
[03:03.800 --> 03:06.460]  They've airbrushed out whatever his European logo was.
[03:06.700 --> 03:07.740]  They don't have a license to it.
[03:08.000 --> 03:09.540]  So, they tend to not be worth anything.
[03:09.660 --> 03:13.940]  Players, until they're in their NBA or NFL or MLB uniform, right?
[03:14.160 --> 03:14.980]  Here's the other one.
[03:15.200 --> 03:18.900]  This one was the base from that series.
[03:19.540 --> 03:20.040]  What do you think it is?
[03:20.040 --> 03:20.840]  What do you think that's worth?
[03:21.220 --> 03:21.660]  $50.
[03:22.220 --> 03:22.500]  Under.
[03:23.560 --> 03:25.520]  By the way, this should be worth $1.
[03:26.020 --> 03:26.380]  Okay.
[03:27.100 --> 03:27.880]  It's worth $20.
[03:28.160 --> 03:28.400]  Okay.
[03:28.540 --> 03:30.360]  Which is, once again, if you have it, sell it yesterday.
[03:30.500 --> 03:31.440]  Because it won't maintain that value.
[03:31.520 --> 03:32.160]  We need to sell this.
[03:32.200 --> 03:33.540]  Here's this Jalen Williams.
[03:34.140 --> 03:38.480]  This is a purple Fastbreak Disco Prism, I believe.
[03:38.720 --> 03:39.900]  Number 250.
[03:40.220 --> 03:42.760]  We picked this up in the mosaic box, Fastbreak box we opened.
[03:43.140 --> 03:44.340]  What do you think this bad boy's worth?
[03:44.420 --> 03:48.880]  Jalen Williams is a touted rookie on the Oklahoma City Thunder.
[03:48.980 --> 03:49.880]  Not anymore, but he was.
[03:49.940 --> 03:50.580]  Everybody loves him.
[03:50.800 --> 03:51.380]  He's popular.
[03:51.900 --> 03:53.940]  He's one of the two Jalen Williams's on that team.
[03:54.080 --> 03:54.380]  $80.
[03:54.380 --> 03:55.260]  Under.
[03:56.480 --> 03:57.760]  Take a zero away.
[03:58.880 --> 03:59.380]  $8?
[04:00.040 --> 04:00.900]  Number 250.
[04:02.000 --> 04:02.380]  $90.
[04:02.780 --> 04:03.080]  What?
[04:03.580 --> 04:03.820]  What?
[04:04.660 --> 04:05.680]  I saw them for sale.
[04:05.840 --> 04:10.000]  I saw some of these sold for $15, but multiple sold for $90.
[04:10.160 --> 04:11.480]  We need to sell this stuff.
[04:11.900 --> 04:12.040]  Yeah.
[04:13.480 --> 04:14.800]  This, Gavin, you might like this one.
[04:15.160 --> 04:17.920]  Clive Russell from Game of Thrones.
[04:18.120 --> 04:18.920]  This is his autograph.
[04:19.160 --> 04:20.160]  I think it's Game of Thrones.
[04:20.600 --> 04:21.420]  On card.
[04:21.740 --> 04:22.500]  Was he Blackfish?
[04:23.800 --> 04:25.140]  He's Sir Brendan Tully.
[04:26.800 --> 04:27.420]  Clive Russell.
[04:28.240 --> 04:28.920]  On card autograph.
[04:29.080 --> 04:29.600]  What do you think that's worth?
[04:30.600 --> 04:31.220]  He touched it.
[04:31.280 --> 04:31.820]  Held it in his hand.
[04:32.000 --> 04:33.360]  Yeah, she squiggled on it.
[04:34.340 --> 04:34.740]  $50.
[04:35.700 --> 04:36.660]  I'll take that over.
[04:37.200 --> 04:37.600]  $25.
[04:38.680 --> 04:40.000]  He's no Daenerys Targaryen.
[04:40.300 --> 04:41.160]  Well, he didn't do much.
[04:41.260 --> 04:41.480]  Yeah.
[04:41.960 --> 04:42.600]  Here we go.
[04:42.700 --> 04:43.520]  Chris Mullen, Otto.
[04:43.600 --> 04:45.120]  We pulled from that Domrus pack.
[04:45.640 --> 04:47.000]  2023 Chris Mullen, Otto.
[04:47.540 --> 04:49.820]  Actually, the second Chris Mullen, Otto I pulled this month.
[04:49.860 --> 04:50.820]  I got one at home as well.
[04:50.940 --> 04:51.300]  Nice.
[04:51.300 --> 04:51.920]  Different one.
[04:52.220 --> 04:53.200]  What do you think that bad boy's worth?
[04:53.280 --> 04:56.080]  Chris Mullen, I don't know if he's in the Hall of Fame or not, but he's a...
[04:56.080 --> 04:56.940]  Flat top king.
[04:57.100 --> 04:57.880]  Flat top king.
[04:58.040 --> 04:59.780]  Most military haircut in the history of the NBA.
[05:00.120 --> 05:01.680]  Really great guard.
[05:01.820 --> 05:02.240]  Great player.
[05:02.360 --> 05:02.920]  What do you think it's worth?
[05:03.560 --> 05:04.220]  You go first.
[05:05.740 --> 05:06.100]  $20.
[05:06.860 --> 05:07.220]  Over.
[05:07.780 --> 05:08.140]  $20.
[05:09.180 --> 05:10.220]  On the dot.
[05:10.680 --> 05:12.020]  And I wanted to show you guys this.
[05:12.580 --> 05:14.000]  Because this doesn't happen very often.
[05:14.140 --> 05:15.360]  I don't think I've ever had this before.
[05:15.600 --> 05:17.700]  I was opening up some Alan and Ginter over the weekend.
[05:17.860 --> 05:18.980]  I bought a blaster at Walmart.
[05:18.980 --> 05:22.400]  And I got this cool Adam Ray.
[05:22.580 --> 05:25.340]  He's a comedian, actor, and lover, apparently.
[05:25.620 --> 05:25.920]  That's what it says.
[05:26.560 --> 05:29.680]  Okay, whenever we get your card for Alan and Ginter.
[05:29.760 --> 05:32.500]  Once we get them on the horn and we talk to them and get you a card.
[05:32.740 --> 05:35.920]  I, as your wife, think you could have a lover.
[05:36.600 --> 05:37.220]  Thank you.
[05:37.840 --> 05:40.000]  So this relic, it doesn't have it.
[05:40.100 --> 05:41.540]  It's like logo here.
[05:41.700 --> 05:43.180]  This is where the relic would have gone.
[05:43.460 --> 05:45.140]  Nice quality control, Pops.
[05:45.220 --> 05:45.840]  Why didn't they put it?
[05:46.180 --> 05:47.000]  Why didn't they put it?
[05:47.000 --> 05:47.640]  That's a great question.
[05:47.640 --> 05:51.020]  Can you imagine how fucking unhappy you'd be if it wasn't some asshole comedian.
[05:51.020 --> 05:53.460]  But it was like, I don't know, Ken Griffey Jr.?
[05:53.460 --> 05:57.260]  I feel like we are maybe three degrees of separation from Adam Ray.
[05:57.380 --> 05:59.360]  That we could be like, hey, can we have some of your hat?
[05:59.520 --> 06:01.500]  Yeah, can you give me a little bit of your hat so I can fix this card?
[06:01.600 --> 06:03.100]  Couldn't that be more valuable if it's an error, though?
[06:03.440 --> 06:05.360]  Yeah, this is technically, I assume, a one of one.
[06:05.460 --> 06:08.060]  I don't know how many they fucked up, but there you go.
[06:08.300 --> 06:09.360]  But you know what?
[06:09.460 --> 06:12.780]  It says that his logo's supposed to be there, but he doesn't have a logo on his hat.
[06:13.060 --> 06:14.500]  It's true. Maybe that's why they couldn't do it.
[06:15.360 --> 06:17.240]  Okay, so that was the hits from last week.
[06:17.240 --> 06:18.620]  Actually, some pretty decent ones.
[06:18.780 --> 06:21.260]  Then the next thing we do is we dive into the pack sack.
[06:21.620 --> 06:23.120]  And we pull out a card.
[06:23.400 --> 06:25.200]  Always looking for a Zimmer.
[06:25.780 --> 06:26.540]  Not gonna be today.
[06:26.700 --> 06:29.380]  Today we're gonna open up Terminator 2 Judgment Day cards.
[06:30.140 --> 06:32.000]  This is when the Terminator's a good guy.
[06:32.080 --> 06:33.840]  Now, you know this movie. You watched it.
[06:34.020 --> 06:35.180]  I did. You showed it to me.
[06:35.520 --> 06:37.300]  I realized I had never seen it.
[06:37.960 --> 06:39.460]  The famous Terminator line.
[06:39.680 --> 06:40.500]  Hasta la vista.
[06:40.900 --> 06:42.720]  Is that where he's popping kneecaps?
[06:42.860 --> 06:43.060]  Yeah.
[06:43.660 --> 06:44.840]  And then, here we go.
[06:45.020 --> 06:46.680]  Terminator sews up Sarah's wound.
[06:48.760 --> 06:50.140]  Exiting the parking garage.
[06:50.240 --> 06:51.720]  That was an exciting moment.
[06:52.660 --> 06:54.920]  I'll be back, he says again.
[06:55.960 --> 06:57.920]  John's autoteller experience pays off.
[06:58.300 --> 06:58.840]  That's when he's...
[06:58.840 --> 07:00.340]  Oh, that's when he can hack the ATM.
[07:00.340 --> 07:01.880]  ATM machines for cash, yeah.
[07:02.600 --> 07:03.860]  Inside a rolling armory.
[07:04.800 --> 07:05.980]  No T-1000 yet?
[07:06.140 --> 07:06.820]  T-1000.
[07:07.120 --> 07:07.880]  Oh, nice mission.
[07:08.540 --> 07:09.720]  God, he was the coolest, wasn't he?
[07:09.900 --> 07:10.760]  He was so cool.
[07:10.860 --> 07:11.760]  I sat behind him on a plane once.
[07:11.900 --> 07:12.240]  For real?
[07:12.400 --> 07:12.580]  Yeah.
[07:12.800 --> 07:14.100]  Did your nephew pee on him?
[07:14.240 --> 07:16.420]  No, my nephew wasn't on the flight, so he was dry.
[07:16.420 --> 07:17.160]  Did you talk to him at all?
[07:17.300 --> 07:17.700]  God, no.
[07:18.220 --> 07:19.020]  Was he cool?
[07:19.160 --> 07:19.680]  Bugged the T-1000?
[07:19.700 --> 07:20.120]  Did he seem cool?
[07:20.320 --> 07:21.560]  He seemed just fine.
[07:22.020 --> 07:23.340]  Did he turn to liquid at all?
[07:23.480 --> 07:24.400]  Did you learn anything about him?
[07:24.500 --> 07:25.020]  He didn't leave.
[07:25.380 --> 07:25.680]  Did he drink liquid?
[07:25.840 --> 07:27.080]  Did he just stare forward?
[07:27.340 --> 07:27.880]  Did he go to the bathroom?
[07:27.960 --> 07:29.620]  Well, I was behind him, so I didn't really see a lot of the action.
[07:29.800 --> 07:30.800]  Did he get him to go to the bathroom at any point?
[07:31.980 --> 07:32.680]  Ooh, I don't know about that.
[07:32.700 --> 07:33.380]  How long was the flight?
[07:33.560 --> 07:34.220]  Probably three hours.
[07:36.260 --> 07:38.220]  Firing back at point-blank range.
[07:40.600 --> 07:41.460]  Observing a mental patient.
[07:41.500 --> 07:42.900]  That guy was in the first one and the second one.
[07:43.020 --> 07:43.300]  Yeah.
[07:43.820 --> 07:44.700]  Observing a mental patient.
[07:44.700 --> 07:46.500]  They were looking at Sarah, all upset.
[07:47.000 --> 07:48.900]  They decided that moment should be on the card.
[07:49.160 --> 07:50.080]  Drive for a minute.
[07:50.920 --> 07:51.720]  Oh, here we go.
[07:51.980 --> 07:54.480]  Here's the T-1000 borrowing a tanker truck.
[07:54.740 --> 07:55.080]  Ooh.
[07:55.320 --> 07:57.980]  Ooh, and this one, into the fire.
[07:58.480 --> 08:02.140]  I learned so much listening to So Alright about James Cameron
[08:02.140 --> 08:04.920]  and, like, tanker trucks and all the trucks and stuff.
[08:04.920 --> 08:06.260]  Yeah, how he used to be a truck driver.
[08:06.880 --> 08:09.060]  You should listen, So Alright Pod, you know?
[08:09.360 --> 08:09.760]  Thank you.
[08:09.760 --> 08:12.660]  Created by Geoff Ramsey, co-host of Fuck Face,
[08:12.740 --> 08:15.420]  at So Alright Pod, everywhere you can find it.
[08:17.660 --> 08:18.400]  Thanks, baby.
[08:18.540 --> 08:19.080]  Of course.
[08:19.160 --> 08:19.680]  I like your hoodie.
[08:19.980 --> 08:20.900]  Is that a Brooks-Marx?
[08:20.900 --> 08:22.140]  It's a Brooks-Marx, yeah.
[08:22.440 --> 08:24.500]  Somebody's a Real Housewives of Salt Lake City fan
[08:24.500 --> 08:25.900]  and a fan of high fashion.
[08:26.160 --> 08:26.520]  Yes.
[08:27.220 --> 08:29.000]  Here's a T2 collector's cap card.
[08:29.100 --> 08:29.240]  Ooh.
[08:29.340 --> 08:30.260]  If you ever wanted to know what that was like.
[08:30.320 --> 08:31.140]  It's a card of a...
[08:31.140 --> 08:32.120]  We could mail...
[08:32.120 --> 08:32.500]  You could order it.
[08:32.700 --> 08:33.540]  Can we...
[08:33.540 --> 08:34.100]  What if we...
[08:34.100 --> 08:35.020]  It was $8.
[08:35.680 --> 08:36.580]  You could get that hat for $8.
[08:36.580 --> 08:38.780]  We could sell the Webanyamo card,
[08:39.460 --> 08:42.820]  then mail a check or money order
[08:42.820 --> 08:45.020]  to T2 Offer.
[08:45.040 --> 08:45.580]  It's in Maryland.
[08:45.600 --> 08:46.360]  Did you ever send a money order?
[08:47.340 --> 08:48.120]  Have I ever had to?
[08:48.320 --> 08:48.760]  Oh, yeah.
[08:48.960 --> 08:51.760]  I would have to go get a Western Union check and stuff.
[08:51.820 --> 08:53.760]  I think I've paid rent and bills that way.
[08:54.020 --> 08:54.540]  Have you ever?
[08:54.780 --> 08:55.080]  No.
[08:55.180 --> 08:57.860]  You probably won't need to at this point.
[09:01.480 --> 09:03.180]  Okay, here's what I want to do.
[09:03.760 --> 09:04.460]  Out the gate,
[09:04.460 --> 09:06.500]  I want to get off to a good start.
[09:06.980 --> 09:07.660]  For once,
[09:07.800 --> 09:09.620]  I want to just jump into one.
[09:09.640 --> 09:10.180]  Oh, hell yeah.
[09:10.260 --> 09:10.940]  We got three of them.
[09:11.120 --> 09:11.380]  Yeah.
[09:11.640 --> 09:12.640]  It's our end of the year blowout.
[09:12.780 --> 09:16.180]  I asked Gracie to buy these so we could portion them out over months.
[09:16.180 --> 09:16.680]  It's Christmas!
[09:17.500 --> 09:18.380]  It's Christmas, right?
[09:18.700 --> 09:18.940]  It's Christmas.
[09:18.980 --> 09:19.580]  Might as well.
[09:19.660 --> 09:20.480]  These are pretty pricey.
[09:20.520 --> 09:20.800]  Whoa.
[09:21.020 --> 09:21.920]  What the fuck is that?
[09:22.040 --> 09:22.600]  I don't know.
[09:25.020 --> 09:25.440]  It's good.
[09:26.460 --> 09:26.800]  Yeah!
[09:28.060 --> 09:28.400]  Okay.
[09:30.080 --> 09:31.200]  2023 Keepsake Edition.
[09:32.380 --> 09:33.080]  Oh, this is exciting.
[09:33.240 --> 09:34.440]  It has a light inside of it.
[09:34.440 --> 09:35.400]  Yeah, you haven't seen it.
[09:35.760 --> 09:35.900]  Yeah.
[09:36.020 --> 09:36.440]  I can't wait.
[09:36.440 --> 09:36.940]  That's cool.
[09:37.220 --> 09:37.800]  So, what do you think?
[09:37.860 --> 09:39.240]  What are some things that we could get from this?
[09:39.540 --> 09:40.360]  Old dead people.
[09:41.060 --> 09:41.460]  Duh.
[09:41.760 --> 09:42.120]  I don't know.
[09:43.380 --> 09:43.780]  Uh...
[09:43.780 --> 09:44.680]  Name an old dead person.
[09:44.740 --> 09:45.400]  Margaret Thatcher.
[09:45.620 --> 09:47.220]  I'm going to guess it's something...
[09:47.220 --> 09:47.680]  Henry Kissinger.
[09:47.720 --> 09:50.220]  I'm going to say it's something related to a United States President.
[09:50.540 --> 09:50.780]  Okay.
[09:51.520 --> 09:52.660]  Taft, maybe.
[09:53.180 --> 09:54.060]  What do you think?
[09:54.320 --> 09:54.780]  Do you think it's...
[09:54.780 --> 09:55.560]  Ulysses S. Grant.
[09:55.660 --> 09:56.700]  Something from England?
[09:58.120 --> 09:58.440]  Ooh.
[09:58.860 --> 10:00.800]  Maybe it's Queen Victoria's...
[10:00.800 --> 10:02.220]  How many hats did Lincoln have?
[10:03.300 --> 10:04.360]  I think they're all the Smithsonian.
[10:04.360 --> 10:06.140]  He was known for one, but he probably had a couple.
[10:06.320 --> 10:07.380]  It could be a piece of Lincoln's hat.
[10:07.420 --> 10:07.980]  A piece of hat.
[10:08.420 --> 10:09.780]  Was he wearing one when he got shot?
[10:10.220 --> 10:11.100]  I don't think he wore hats inside.
[10:11.220 --> 10:11.660]  Well, maybe.
[10:12.200 --> 10:13.880]  Wasn't it kind of rude to not wear a hat back then?
[10:14.160 --> 10:15.120]  I think that was in England.
[10:15.320 --> 10:17.580]  As I've been watching The Crown, she wears hats inside all the time.
[10:17.860 --> 10:19.280]  It was of note if you didn't wear a hat.
[10:19.420 --> 10:20.200]  All right, so here we go.
[10:20.440 --> 10:21.540]  We're going to open this bad boy up.
[10:23.220 --> 10:25.580]  Oh, the light coming out.
[10:26.160 --> 10:27.480]  It's like Marcellus Wallace's soul.
[10:27.480 --> 10:28.260]  Yeah, the briefcase.
[10:30.960 --> 10:32.020]  What is it?
[10:32.120 --> 10:33.380]  I don't know who this is.
[10:33.540 --> 10:34.760]  It is...
[10:34.760 --> 10:36.040]  Whoa, that is a mustache.
[10:36.500 --> 10:39.380]  It is Anton...
[10:40.040 --> 10:40.840]  Antoni Pater.
[10:41.460 --> 10:42.300]  What did he do?
[10:42.540 --> 10:43.620]  It looks like a piece of watch.
[10:43.640 --> 10:46.300]  Is it a piece of those absolute muttons on his face?
[10:46.380 --> 10:46.840]  Look at them.
[10:47.080 --> 10:48.400]  It is Antoni Pater.
[10:48.640 --> 10:49.040]  Congratulations.
[10:49.300 --> 10:56.180]  The front of this card contains an authentic and genuine watch dial that is guaranteed by Super Products Incorporated.
[10:56.420 --> 10:57.840]  So, who is Antoni Pater?
[10:57.840 --> 10:58.840]  It's Antoni...
[10:59.760 --> 11:00.520]  Antoni Pater.
[11:00.620 --> 11:01.240]  P-A-T-E...
[11:01.240 --> 11:01.780]  Oh, Patek.
[11:01.900 --> 11:02.640]  P-A-T-E-K.
[11:03.300 --> 11:04.060]  Anthony Patek.
[11:04.440 --> 11:04.780]  Okay.
[11:05.000 --> 11:05.460]  What did he say?
[11:05.600 --> 11:06.880]  Oh, is it like a Patek Philippe guy?
[11:07.220 --> 11:08.540]  He is maybe...
[11:08.540 --> 11:09.120]  Patek Philippe?
[11:09.200 --> 11:09.600]  Do you know what that...
[11:09.600 --> 11:10.260]  Is that a watch company?
[11:10.400 --> 11:10.540]  Yeah.
[11:10.700 --> 11:10.880]  Yeah.
[11:11.300 --> 11:11.820]  I'm sorry.
[11:12.240 --> 11:14.300]  Wikipedia is trying to get me to donate money right now.
[11:14.460 --> 11:14.920]  I'll do it later.
[11:16.500 --> 11:25.220]  He was a Polish pioneer in watchmaking and the creator of Swiss watchmaker company Patek Philippe & Co.
[11:25.220 --> 11:29.340]  As well as a Polish independence fighter and political activist.
[11:29.680 --> 11:33.400]  And his thing is not just... it goes like this.
[11:33.580 --> 11:33.920]  Oh.
[11:34.320 --> 11:35.380]  It's a little swoop.
[11:35.500 --> 11:36.000]  That's cool.
[11:36.100 --> 11:39.080]  He was born in 1812 and he died in 1877.
[11:39.660 --> 11:39.920]  Dang.
[11:40.420 --> 11:41.140]  So, he made watches.
[11:42.020 --> 11:42.280]  Yeah.
[11:43.160 --> 11:45.620]  Gracie is very quietly trying to tell you to do something off camera.
[11:45.860 --> 11:46.200]  Just so you know.
[11:46.540 --> 11:46.800]  Oh.
[11:46.800 --> 11:47.380]  There you go.
[11:47.560 --> 11:49.320]  I can't use my soundboard.
[11:49.400 --> 11:49.640]  I'm sorry.
[11:50.200 --> 11:52.620]  Oh, I was using totally copyrighted stuff too.
[11:52.920 --> 11:53.280]  And then...
[11:53.760 --> 11:54.200]  Sorry.
[11:55.040 --> 11:57.360]  That would have been the thing you didn't say out loud.
[11:57.540 --> 11:58.100]  It's fine.
[11:58.160 --> 12:00.420]  I'm letting them know that I can't play Christmas music anymore.
[12:00.980 --> 12:01.660]  Transparency, all right?
[12:02.800 --> 12:03.520]  Oh, boy.
[12:03.660 --> 12:05.680]  Now, I figured out where things are.
[12:06.040 --> 12:06.860]  What is cheating?
[12:07.180 --> 12:07.360]  See?
[12:09.800 --> 12:11.020]  So, what is it again?
[12:11.440 --> 12:11.800]  Patek?
[12:11.920 --> 12:12.600]  Patek Philippe.
[12:12.640 --> 12:13.180]  You've heard of them?
[12:13.260 --> 12:13.980]  Yeah, they make watches.
[12:14.220 --> 12:15.100]  Like fancy watches, probably.
[12:15.140 --> 12:16.220]  Like Rolex kind of thing?
[12:16.660 --> 12:17.200]  Well, yeah.
[12:17.340 --> 12:18.700]  I've never seen one that I can afford.
[12:18.700 --> 12:21.320]  Swiss luxury watch and clock manufacturer.
[12:21.800 --> 12:23.160]  Located in Geneva.
[12:24.680 --> 12:25.200]  Connecticut?
[12:26.000 --> 12:26.620]  Mm-hmm.
[12:26.680 --> 12:28.240]  Yeah, the Princess of Genovia.
[12:30.860 --> 12:31.380]  Genosha?
[12:31.720 --> 12:32.000]  Oof.
[12:32.380 --> 12:33.240]  X-Men didn't like that.
[12:33.440 --> 12:33.840]  Geonosis?
[12:34.740 --> 12:35.260]  Geonosis?
[12:35.780 --> 12:37.660]  Well, Princess of Genovia was Princess Diaries.
[12:38.540 --> 12:39.800]  Right, Genovia was Princess Diaries.
[12:41.760 --> 12:43.560]  All right, we'll open up some NBA.
[12:43.960 --> 12:44.480]  Whoa!
[12:45.040 --> 12:47.140]  How much do you think these watches are?
[12:47.300 --> 12:47.820]  I don't know.
[12:47.820 --> 12:49.740]  Yeah, I know you don't know.
[12:49.760 --> 12:49.840]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[12:50.220 --> 12:50.600]  I'm sorry.
[12:51.980 --> 12:52.800]  I'm sorry.
[12:52.980 --> 12:54.800]  Oh, you don't know?
[12:55.500 --> 12:55.820]  Yeah.
[12:59.200 --> 13:00.420]  Ten grand.
[13:01.720 --> 13:02.820]  Gavin, would you like to play?
[13:04.180 --> 13:06.300]  I mean, I think there's some six-figure ones on there.
[13:07.400 --> 13:12.660]  This one from Watchbox is $120,000.
[13:14.380 --> 13:15.380]  That's used.
[13:15.980 --> 13:20.300]  So we have most of, or we have at least some of $120,000.
[13:20.400 --> 13:23.400]  I wonder if we could get enough piece, collect enough of these that we could build the watch.
[13:23.480 --> 13:23.680]  Yeah.
[13:23.920 --> 13:27.540]  I mean, that might be a watch with a smashed-up dial that you could just plop that into.
[13:27.620 --> 13:28.760]  Oh, shit, dude.
[13:29.300 --> 13:30.780]  That's $100,000 worth.
[13:30.780 --> 13:32.000]  This is that quiet luxury.
[13:34.440 --> 13:35.460]  Quiet luxury, yeah.
[13:35.980 --> 13:36.840]  Yeah, like you wouldn't know.
[13:36.920 --> 13:38.440]  Like, you'd see it and go, oh, it's not a Rolex.
[13:38.740 --> 13:41.560]  But they'd be like, yeah, but it's worth a billion times more.
[13:41.620 --> 13:42.420]  Keegan Murray.
[13:43.020 --> 13:45.360]  When did Rolex become, like, the ultimate in luxury?
[13:46.060 --> 13:46.780]  Jalen Williams.
[13:46.900 --> 13:49.060]  Didn't they used to just be, like, functional watches at one point?
[13:49.460 --> 13:49.820]  Were they?
[13:50.260 --> 13:50.760]  I don't know.
[13:51.120 --> 13:51.960]  Maybe they just decided.
[13:51.980 --> 13:52.940]  It's like Grey Goose Vodka.
[13:53.060 --> 13:54.460]  They just doubled their price and said they were premium.
[13:56.000 --> 13:56.360]  Kalkuzma.
[13:56.860 --> 13:57.580]  LeBron James.
[13:57.940 --> 14:01.080]  Oh, the guy under his legs is really cool.
[14:02.220 --> 14:03.760]  He's just, like, staring at LeBron's crotch.
[14:03.920 --> 14:04.940]  That's a great perspective.
[14:05.040 --> 14:05.720]  He just looks tiny.
[14:06.940 --> 14:07.640]  Kevin Porter.
[14:07.740 --> 14:08.640]  Oh, it's like forced perspective.
[14:08.780 --> 14:08.920]  Yeah.
[14:10.900 --> 14:11.260]  KPJ.
[14:13.460 --> 14:14.180]  Kelton Johnson.
[14:15.360 --> 14:16.720]  Fred Van Vliet.
[14:16.880 --> 14:17.440]  Juicy booty.
[14:18.020 --> 14:19.260]  James Bookknight.
[14:19.900 --> 14:20.860]  Miles Turner.
[14:21.200 --> 14:21.600]  Ooh!
[14:22.340 --> 14:23.780]  Everybody loves Ben Simmons.
[14:24.160 --> 14:25.160]  That's your favorite player.
[14:25.280 --> 14:26.780]  Hopefully we get his shoes later.
[14:27.300 --> 14:28.180]  Bradley Beal.
[14:28.480 --> 14:29.360]  Blue Parallel.
[14:29.600 --> 14:31.620]  And a Jaden Ivey.
[14:32.220 --> 14:34.040]  Who's shoes do you think we have?
[14:34.420 --> 14:34.680]  Kobe.
[14:35.300 --> 14:35.760]  Whoa.
[14:36.240 --> 14:37.260]  I think we have Kobe shoes.
[14:37.420 --> 14:38.800]  You think they would sell those?
[14:39.660 --> 14:40.300]  They'd have to.
[14:40.720 --> 14:43.200]  Yeah, but I bet those are worth so much more.
[14:43.200 --> 14:45.180]  They know what they're putting in here.
[14:45.400 --> 14:49.820]  Yeah, there's gonna be one thing that's worth a dickload of money, and the 99 things that aren't worth a dickload of money.
[14:50.900 --> 14:52.520]  Probably the Kobe would be the one to get.
[14:52.640 --> 14:53.740]  26 out of 100?
[14:54.160 --> 14:57.840]  Yeah, there's a hundred of... it's only one shoe, too. I don't think you get the whole pair.
[14:58.780 --> 15:01.160]  I wonder who has 25, if that's, like, our...
[15:01.160 --> 15:01.880]  If it's the other shoe?
[15:02.400 --> 15:03.000]  Rudy Gobbert.
[15:06.120 --> 15:08.560]  I just learned. Maybe I should pronounce all names wrong.
[15:10.380 --> 15:11.100]  Nikola Jovic.
[15:12.020 --> 15:12.700]  Gary Payton.
[15:12.700 --> 15:13.360]  The second.
[15:14.280 --> 15:15.000]  Walker Kessler.
[15:15.160 --> 15:16.160]  Jalen Green.
[15:16.780 --> 15:18.060]  Luke Kennard.
[15:18.780 --> 15:19.860]  Santi Aldama.
[15:20.480 --> 15:21.760]  Malik Beasley.
[15:22.220 --> 15:24.460]  Dougie Buckets, as they call Doug McDermott.
[15:24.800 --> 15:27.980]  Grant Williams, no longer a Celtic, playing for the Dallas Mavericks.
[15:28.900 --> 15:30.680]  Does he like playing with Kyrie again?
[15:32.200 --> 15:33.060]  Does anyone?
[15:33.680 --> 15:34.800]  Darius Garland.
[15:35.220 --> 15:36.460]  Derek Rose.
[15:36.920 --> 15:39.640]  John Collins, no longer plays for the Atlanta Hawks.
[15:39.700 --> 15:42.060]  They finally traded him after threatening to for 100 years.
[15:42.520 --> 15:43.080]  LaMelo Ball.
[15:43.260 --> 15:44.560]  That's a silver one.
[15:44.760 --> 15:46.400]  And then Jason Tatum.
[15:46.540 --> 15:46.880]  That's paper.
[15:46.980 --> 15:47.500]  That's not silver.
[15:47.540 --> 15:48.300]  You can see the difference.
[15:50.900 --> 15:51.180]  Cool.
[15:52.420 --> 15:54.160]  In the sense that we didn't really get anything there.
[15:54.520 --> 15:55.060]  We'll open two more.
[15:55.360 --> 15:56.480]  And then, what do we open next?
[15:56.520 --> 15:57.180]  Should we do some mail?
[15:57.340 --> 15:57.880]  We got a bunch of mail.
[15:57.900 --> 15:58.300]  Oh, yeah.
[16:01.440 --> 16:02.240]  Gavin, what's new with you?
[16:03.260 --> 16:05.040]  I've just been arguing all afternoon.
[16:05.140 --> 16:05.940]  It's been an arguing day.
[16:06.160 --> 16:06.860]  I don't hate it.
[16:06.900 --> 16:10.300]  We did our end of the year, like, let's talk about what we want to do next year.
[16:10.300 --> 16:11.520]  Let's put all the ideas on the board.
[16:11.720 --> 16:13.380]  Eric was contentious.
[16:14.640 --> 16:15.580]  Royce O'Neal.
[16:15.860 --> 16:18.660]  If there's no disagreement with Eric, we're doing something wrong.
[16:18.820 --> 16:19.160]  I agree.
[16:19.320 --> 16:20.000]  Christian Coloco.
[16:20.460 --> 16:21.480]  Yeah, I agree.
[16:21.840 --> 16:22.940]  Jonas Fontounas.
[16:23.600 --> 16:25.580]  PJ Tucker, still around for some reason.
[16:26.280 --> 16:27.140]  Mo Bamba.
[16:27.480 --> 16:28.300]  Landry Schammett.
[16:29.500 --> 16:31.020]  Ooh, Malcolm Brogdon.
[16:31.240 --> 16:32.840]  He's a Portland Trailblazer, not a Celtic anymore.
[16:32.960 --> 16:35.260]  Seth Curry has a much more successful brother.
[16:35.660 --> 16:38.320]  Laurie Markkinen gets no respect.
[16:38.620 --> 16:39.680]  PJ Washington Jr.
[16:39.680 --> 16:40.840]  I have no facts about him.
[16:41.140 --> 16:42.520]  George Hill, I've never liked.
[16:42.900 --> 16:46.460]  Jeremy Sohan, that's a blue parallel rookie.
[16:46.560 --> 16:47.000]  That's nice.
[16:47.400 --> 16:49.240]  And then, ooh, Paolo Bancaro.
[16:50.180 --> 16:50.940]  Rookie greetings.
[16:51.860 --> 16:52.900]  We have two more packs.
[16:53.000 --> 16:53.820]  We'll get through them very quickly.
[16:54.180 --> 16:55.580]  You guys released a video today.
[16:56.200 --> 16:58.060]  Like a surprise video that you made today, huh?
[16:58.160 --> 16:59.540]  Oh, yeah, we did on the YouTube channel.
[16:59.620 --> 17:00.460]  Testing out some prototypes.
[17:00.740 --> 17:01.440]  Testing out a prototype.
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.140]  I just don't understand why it was that color.
[17:04.860 --> 17:05.440]  That was unfortunate.
[17:05.440 --> 17:06.200]  The one that was yours.
[17:07.000 --> 17:07.760]  Jordan Poole.
[17:07.920 --> 17:09.100]  I thought it was awesome.
[17:09.100 --> 17:10.360]  Bryce McGowan.
[17:10.700 --> 17:11.200]  Luca.
[17:12.080 --> 17:14.460]  When he signs his signature, he just signs Lulu.
[17:15.280 --> 17:15.540]  Really?
[17:15.860 --> 17:17.040]  Yeah, L-U-L-U, Lulu.
[17:17.920 --> 17:18.840]  Kenny Lofton Jr.
[17:19.380 --> 17:20.320]  He's a...
[17:22.360 --> 17:23.000]  Well...
[17:23.000 --> 17:23.520]  What's he?
[17:24.200 --> 17:26.320]  He's a young basketball player who's...
[17:28.180 --> 17:30.020]  Who's on the heavier side.
[17:30.720 --> 17:31.420]  He's a thick boy.
[17:31.500 --> 17:31.680]  Yeah.
[17:32.660 --> 17:34.480]  That's been an issue with him.
[17:34.840 --> 17:35.760]  Kentavious Caldwell-Pulp.
[17:36.040 --> 17:37.100]  Anthony Davis.
[17:37.440 --> 17:38.360]  Christian Wood.
[17:40.660 --> 17:41.140]  Uh...
[17:41.140 --> 17:43.060]  Yeah, that's what crosses are made out of.
[17:43.280 --> 17:43.840]  Christian Wood?
[17:43.980 --> 17:44.140]  Yeah.
[17:44.920 --> 17:46.360]  Brandon Boston Jr.
[17:46.820 --> 17:48.060]  Cam Reddish.
[17:48.200 --> 17:48.640]  Thank you.
[17:49.340 --> 17:50.140]  DeAndre Hunter.
[17:50.860 --> 17:52.040]  Gary Trent Jr.
[17:52.400 --> 17:53.740]  Tyler Not-a-Hero.
[17:55.020 --> 17:55.500]  And...
[17:55.500 --> 17:56.100]  Christian Brown.
[17:56.700 --> 17:57.800]  Who do you think the drummer was for that?
[17:58.740 --> 17:59.660]  Do you think they know?
[18:00.120 --> 18:02.000]  Do you think it was like a garage band combo?
[18:02.920 --> 18:06.360]  Yeah, I mean, I think it was like Michael Rim was who it was.
[18:06.520 --> 18:07.180]  The Rimster?
[18:07.520 --> 18:08.060]  The Rimshot.
[18:09.320 --> 18:10.260]  Jalen Duren.
[18:10.720 --> 18:11.900]  Anthony Davis.
[18:12.020 --> 18:13.180]  Dyson Daniels.
[18:13.180 --> 18:14.100]  Lugans Thorpe.
[18:15.680 --> 18:16.720]  Davion Mitchell.
[18:17.140 --> 18:18.480]  Robert Covington.
[18:18.620 --> 18:19.600]  Brendan Ingram.
[18:19.900 --> 18:20.420]  Inconsistent.
[18:20.560 --> 18:21.680]  Jared Vanderbilt.
[18:22.320 --> 18:23.180]  Miles Camp.
[18:23.320 --> 18:24.380]  Miles Bridges.
[18:24.500 --> 18:24.840]  Tyrese Halliburton.
[18:24.840 --> 18:26.740]  I don't know which roles they are.
[18:26.860 --> 18:27.940]  Evan Mobley.
[18:27.980 --> 18:28.940]  Emanuella Clickley.
[18:29.500 --> 18:30.260]  And Zion Williamson.
[18:31.740 --> 18:32.040]  Cool.
[18:32.100 --> 18:32.580]  There we go.
[18:32.720 --> 18:32.940]  Alright.
[18:33.200 --> 18:33.560]  I'm sorry.
[18:33.940 --> 18:34.440]  I messed up.
[18:35.020 --> 18:35.560]  Not at all.
[18:35.680 --> 18:37.440]  That'd be good for the next one of these though, that drum roll.
[18:37.440 --> 18:38.640]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:38.660 --> 18:39.720]  When the lights are coming out.
[18:40.020 --> 18:41.460]  Here's a piece of mail somebody sent me.
[18:41.720 --> 18:43.800]  To dear Geoff, Emily, and guests.
[18:43.920 --> 18:44.400]  That'd be you.
[18:44.440 --> 18:44.700]  Okay.
[18:45.160 --> 18:49.220]  Sometimes the cards don't always fall the way we want them to, but sometimes they do.
[18:49.300 --> 18:52.460]  As evident by your incredible relationship and wholesomeness as a couple.
[18:52.780 --> 18:54.260]  Oh, I think he was talking about us.
[18:55.120 --> 18:55.560]  That's true.
[18:55.940 --> 19:00.920]  Cards are a gamble, so please enjoy these mystery packs of guaranteed jackass trading card hits,
[19:01.060 --> 19:04.480]  each containing numbered and at least one refractor per envelope.
[19:04.480 --> 19:07.560]  Feel free to open all or save for the days when you need one to hit.
[19:07.660 --> 19:11.260]  I only request that you save the one marked for last as the last one.
[19:11.360 --> 19:11.720]  Whoa.
[19:12.180 --> 19:14.500]  And to please don't drown them in pickle juice.
[19:14.720 --> 19:15.820]  Shredding is a better alternative.
[19:16.420 --> 19:17.820]  Long time fan, yada yada.
[19:18.280 --> 19:23.400]  Boy, they really ruined the yada yada thing with the stupid cell phone commercials for yada yada now.
[19:23.480 --> 19:27.880]  They have George Costanza in them and his son, Jason Alexander.
[19:28.180 --> 19:29.500]  Yeah, because they don't make sense.
[19:29.660 --> 19:31.500]  Why'd you yada yada over the nice part of that?
[19:31.960 --> 19:33.460]  It says, long time fan, yada yada.
[19:33.460 --> 19:34.180]  Oh, he wrote that.
[19:34.440 --> 19:34.920]  Yada yada.
[19:35.460 --> 19:36.760]  I thought you were just skipping it.
[19:36.880 --> 19:38.080]  No, I was reading what he wrote.
[19:38.420 --> 19:39.280]  Or what they wrote, I don't know.
[19:39.900 --> 19:43.340]  Congratulations on your marriage and enjoy just a bit of repayment for all the good vibes.
[19:44.080 --> 19:44.400]  Ooh.
[19:44.440 --> 19:44.960]  And entertainment.
[19:45.280 --> 19:46.480]  You just put out the good vibes.
[19:46.840 --> 19:47.500]  You put out into the world.
[19:47.900 --> 19:50.600]  TLDR, jackass cards each envelope containing numbered, please no pickle juice.
[19:50.680 --> 19:53.300]  Oh, I also ordered the wrong Bob Ross cards, my mistake. Oops.
[19:53.620 --> 19:54.600]  Thanks for the laughs and content.
[19:54.720 --> 19:57.740]  And then he said, fun fact, hometown of Port Richey, Florida,
[19:57.900 --> 20:01.240]  home of the worst mango street as per episode one of So All Right.
[20:01.400 --> 20:02.920]  Hey, at So All Right Pod.
[20:02.920 --> 20:04.960]  Can confirm, it actually sucks.
[20:05.380 --> 20:11.660]  Our former mayor, Dale Massad, was arrested for attempted homicide on a law enforcement officer.
[20:12.280 --> 20:14.060]  Article printout included, unrelated.
[20:14.280 --> 20:17.240]  The county sheriff's office has a pending RICO lawsuit.
[20:17.480 --> 20:17.920]  Oopsie.
[20:18.220 --> 20:20.340]  The mayor tried to kill a cop.
[20:21.100 --> 20:21.560]  Let's find out.
[20:21.580 --> 20:23.160]  They obviously didn't have a dog mayor.
[20:23.280 --> 20:25.720]  This is similar to what Andrew and I will be doing in that Sunday night show.
[20:25.780 --> 20:26.180]  Oh, is this?
[20:26.540 --> 20:28.500]  Oh, we get a printout of, ooh.
[20:29.040 --> 20:31.840]  Former Port Richey mayor gets three years for shooting at deputies.
[20:31.840 --> 20:32.320]  Oops.
[20:32.380 --> 20:35.780]  Dale Massad, who was still the mayor at the time of his arrest in February 2019,
[20:35.960 --> 20:37.660]  will spend three years in prison.
[20:37.860 --> 20:38.220]  Wow.
[20:38.460 --> 20:38.820]  Oof.
[20:39.820 --> 20:40.540]  That's wild.
[20:41.040 --> 20:41.400]  Wow.
[20:42.740 --> 20:46.360]  He thought the deputies were intruders when he was awakened at 4.40 a.m.
[20:47.640 --> 20:49.000]  He grabbed a gun and shot...
[20:49.000 --> 20:49.200]  Ooh.
[20:49.960 --> 20:50.720]  Yeah, yeah, anyway.
[20:51.420 --> 20:53.440]  So he thought he was doing it in self-defense?
[20:53.620 --> 20:54.260]  That's what he said.
[20:54.380 --> 20:55.060]  And he got three years?
[20:55.380 --> 20:55.560]  Yeah.
[20:57.460 --> 20:57.940]  Oh, boy.
[20:58.140 --> 20:58.740]  I hope that...
[20:58.740 --> 20:58.980]  Oh, boy.
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.080]  And then there's a RICO lawsuit now.
[21:01.080 --> 21:02.740]  So he said open the last one last.
[21:03.000 --> 21:03.780]  Open me first.
[21:04.040 --> 21:04.760]  We'll do that.
[21:04.860 --> 21:06.280]  And then got milk?
[21:06.500 --> 21:06.940]  We'll open that.
[21:07.300 --> 21:07.580]  Oh, wait.
[21:07.620 --> 21:08.560]  There's one called farm animals.
[21:08.660 --> 21:09.160]  We'll do that one.
[21:10.500 --> 21:12.500]  And then we'll save the rest for rainy days.
[21:12.640 --> 21:18.320]  I told Geoff the other night that if I die, he can be with you after and that's it.
[21:18.800 --> 21:19.760]  Oh, that's the only option?
[21:20.680 --> 21:24.480]  Other than being like super sad all the time, then he could be with you.
[21:24.680 --> 21:27.140]  She really keyed into the whole thing about how you tried to kiss me that time.
[21:30.000 --> 21:31.680]  What version of the story did you get?
[21:31.980 --> 21:39.120]  He said that you guys were cuddling because you guys used to cuddle a lot.
[21:39.160 --> 21:39.900]  100% true.
[21:40.080 --> 21:41.360]  We were hanging on the rocker.
[21:41.540 --> 21:42.680]  We weren't cuddling then.
[21:42.940 --> 21:44.880]  We were like sitting right next to each other.
[21:44.900 --> 21:46.100]  We were just sat next to each other, yeah.
[21:46.200 --> 21:50.340]  Yeah, but in a reclined position, were you sharing a blankie?
[21:51.260 --> 21:51.660]  Yes!
[21:52.760 --> 21:54.240]  We used to share blankets.
[21:54.280 --> 21:54.960]  Yeah, it's cold.
[21:54.960 --> 22:00.520]  And that everybody left the room and that you turned to him and said,
[22:00.520 --> 22:02.580]  well, so should we make out now?
[22:03.120 --> 22:03.400]  Right.
[22:03.600 --> 22:06.840]  And then Geoff said no and that you kind of went, oh yeah, yeah, no, I was joking.
[22:07.000 --> 22:08.440]  I was actually joking.
[22:08.760 --> 22:13.900]  That we were literally surrounded by people and then it got really quiet because the last person went out.
[22:14.180 --> 22:15.400]  I was like, so we should make out now, right?
[22:19.580 --> 22:20.380]  Jackass 3D!
[22:21.880 --> 22:23.720]  Oh, fuck, the jet ski one!
[22:23.820 --> 22:24.520]  That's awesome!
[22:25.360 --> 22:26.140]  Gotta get it graded.
[22:26.220 --> 22:30.460]  We're gonna get every jet ski related card graded and that's gonna be our list.
[22:30.560 --> 22:33.520]  We're gonna have a PSA 10 of every jet ski card on Earth.
[22:33.700 --> 22:34.880]  So let's put that one over there.
[22:35.000 --> 22:35.860]  Thank you so much.
[22:35.880 --> 22:36.640]  Oh, hell yeah.
[22:36.660 --> 22:37.860]  Here's the hurricane slide.
[22:41.420 --> 22:46.060]  Oh, and then our parallel is gonna be slimed by the Pawnosaurus.
[22:46.480 --> 22:47.220]  Oh, sick.
[22:47.760 --> 22:48.460]  23 of 25.
[22:48.760 --> 22:49.900]  So that would be jism.
[22:50.960 --> 23:01.960]  When we did the Pawnius episode and one of them was his painted dinosaur dick or whatever, or dragon dick, we lost like 300 viewers immediately.
[23:02.120 --> 23:02.640]  Oh, wow.
[23:02.840 --> 23:03.900]  People watching at work, maybe?
[23:03.960 --> 23:04.780]  They didn't like it.
[23:04.900 --> 23:05.660]  They came back, though.
[23:05.660 --> 23:07.900]  There's a time and a place for a surprise penis.
[23:11.000 --> 23:19.320]  It may seem a tad on the nose, but it's only right and natural that the Pawnosaurus has the ability to shoot ropey loads of slime to decimate the troops.
[23:19.320 --> 23:20.480]  Ropey loads.
[23:21.340 --> 23:22.220]  Ropey loads.
[23:22.500 --> 23:24.180]  The yak charge.
[23:24.540 --> 23:25.260]  That's a classic.
[23:25.460 --> 23:26.540]  That's a great one.
[23:26.900 --> 23:29.600]  Oh, pin the tail on the donkey, Aaron.
[23:30.380 --> 23:31.300]  Oh, and here's another.
[23:31.880 --> 23:32.720]  60s, we have 100.
[23:32.880 --> 23:33.540]  Silver parallel.
[23:33.660 --> 23:34.800]  Pin the tail on the donkey.
[23:34.960 --> 23:35.760]  Danger, Aaron.
[23:35.780 --> 23:36.280]  There you go.
[23:36.340 --> 23:37.660]  They even double sleeved these.
[23:37.820 --> 23:38.360]  That's awesome.
[23:39.200 --> 23:40.260]  Thank you so much.
[23:40.420 --> 23:45.260]  Him getting his bollocks crushed by that pogo stick was one of the most horrific things.
[23:45.900 --> 23:46.760]  Like, it's just brutal.
[23:47.400 --> 23:49.140]  It could have knocked his cock off.
[23:49.140 --> 23:51.480]  That and when Francis and Ganyu punched him in the dick.
[23:51.600 --> 23:52.420]  That was...
[23:52.420 --> 23:55.640]  That guy beat the shit out of Tyson Fury.
[23:56.860 --> 23:57.660]  And his balls.
[23:58.420 --> 24:02.600]  Geoff, I found these packs at Kamikaze, a comic book store in Somerville, MA.
[24:03.180 --> 24:04.940]  Thought they would be fun to open on the break show.
[24:05.020 --> 24:05.540]  Go Celtics!
[24:05.860 --> 24:06.440]  Go Celtics!
[24:07.080 --> 24:07.700]  Thank you, Francisco.
[24:08.600 --> 24:10.100]  There was a few more, but...
[24:10.100 --> 24:10.720]  He looks very red.
[24:11.400 --> 24:11.720]  Hulk Hogan?
[24:11.920 --> 24:13.060]  I think that was the steroids.
[24:13.460 --> 24:14.460]  And the tanning.
[24:15.600 --> 24:17.020]  He spends a lot of time in the sun.
[24:17.460 --> 24:17.960]  He's Florida.
[24:19.660 --> 24:20.300]  He's Florida.
[24:20.320 --> 24:21.740]  Trash, trash, trash, trash.
[24:23.540 --> 24:25.860]  Ooh, Million Dollar Man, Ted DiBiase.
[24:26.340 --> 24:28.820]  You know, Eric's not here, so I'll give you guys wrestling facts.
[24:28.900 --> 24:29.200]  Okay, thank you.
[24:29.220 --> 24:32.320]  Little known fact, Million Dollar Man, Ted DiBiase, wasn't a millionaire.
[24:32.840 --> 24:33.100]  Ever?
[24:33.660 --> 24:37.700]  Power and glory, that's what he named his left and his right knee.
[24:38.040 --> 24:38.700]  Oh, knees.
[24:39.080 --> 24:40.000]  He thought all his power was in his knees.
[24:40.700 --> 24:44.560]  Oh, here we have Big Boss Man, actual cop.
[24:44.900 --> 24:45.480]  That's his uniform.
[24:45.640 --> 24:46.280]  Well, if you...
[24:46.280 --> 24:47.220]  I don't know, I'm making all this up.
[24:47.220 --> 24:52.320]  If you punched up like this at one mile an hour, and then your knees went up at one mile an hour...
[24:52.320 --> 24:56.080]  Yeah, like, are your arms now going up two miles an hour?
[24:56.400 --> 24:56.600]  Yeah.
[24:57.100 --> 24:57.720]  Jimmy Hart?
[24:58.360 --> 25:00.560]  That's the perfect way to describe it.
[25:00.920 --> 25:02.960]  And to see if we can get the answers.
[25:03.940 --> 25:05.120]  Because that is... yeah.
[25:05.840 --> 25:06.600]  You're... no.
[25:07.760 --> 25:08.240]  No.
[25:08.340 --> 25:10.420]  This is basically the argument.
[25:10.800 --> 25:14.140]  Interesting fact about Jimmy Hart, he wore a piano tie.
[25:14.260 --> 25:15.220]  He goes, ayyy.
[25:15.220 --> 25:18.400]  Oh, and he had to have a heart transplant in, like, 1998.
[25:18.920 --> 25:22.900]  But much like that, they couldn't get a human heart for him, so much like that Christian...
[25:24.000 --> 25:24.620]  What's his name?
[25:25.660 --> 25:26.380]  Christian Horner?
[25:27.020 --> 25:28.660]  The guy from the Red Bull coach?
[25:28.780 --> 25:28.920]  No.
[25:29.040 --> 25:29.300]  Christian Horner?
[25:29.400 --> 25:30.140]  Pump up the volume.
[25:31.740 --> 25:32.740]  Pump up the jams?
[25:32.800 --> 25:33.580]  Pump up the volume.
[25:34.520 --> 25:35.360]  Mr. Robot.
[25:36.280 --> 25:36.640]  Christian.
[25:37.500 --> 25:38.800]  His sister was...
[25:38.800 --> 25:39.380]  Sister Christian?
[25:39.500 --> 25:40.960]  His sister was in...
[25:40.960 --> 25:41.400]  Knight Rider?
[25:42.020 --> 25:45.380]  No, his sister was in The Legend of Billie Jean.
[25:45.980 --> 25:47.080]  Oh, the tennis player?
[25:47.240 --> 25:47.720]  Slater, Christian Slater.
[25:47.900 --> 25:48.080]  Oh.
[25:48.260 --> 25:48.640]  Thank you.
[25:49.620 --> 25:53.680]  Much like Christian Slater in that movie Untamed Heart, where he had to get a heart transplant,
[25:53.940 --> 25:54.940]  but he had to get a monkey heart.
[25:55.540 --> 25:56.600]  And then he eventually died.
[25:56.760 --> 25:57.640]  And Marissa told me it was sad.
[25:58.100 --> 25:59.680]  Aren't pig hearts the ones you can use?
[25:59.700 --> 26:00.740]  He actually had a monkey heart?
[26:00.820 --> 26:02.000]  In the movie, I think it was a monkey heart.
[26:02.180 --> 26:02.820]  Maybe it was a pig heart.
[26:02.980 --> 26:03.580]  I don't know if it was a monkey heart.
[26:03.760 --> 26:05.600]  I think that you can use a pig heart for, like...
[26:05.600 --> 26:06.200]  Maybe it was a pig heart.
[26:06.320 --> 26:07.320]  It was a long time ago it came out.
[26:07.560 --> 26:10.900]  Anyway, they worked at a restaurant together, and he had a heart transplant, and he was sick.
[26:10.900 --> 26:14.000]  And then he defended her one night when some guys tried to beat her up in a parking lot.
[26:14.060 --> 26:14.880]  Or a robber.
[26:15.060 --> 26:15.900]  And then they fell in love.
[26:15.960 --> 26:16.680]  But then he was sick.
[26:17.320 --> 26:17.880]  That's sad.
[26:18.160 --> 26:18.600]  Untamed Heart.
[26:18.640 --> 26:19.020]  Hulk Hogan.
[26:19.740 --> 26:21.220]  He's hitting him with a...
[26:21.220 --> 26:22.540]  Is that the woo guy?
[26:22.880 --> 26:23.480]  Fun fact.
[26:24.460 --> 26:29.200]  He is hitting that dude in the back with a 2x4, but what he's really doing is looking up his butthole.
[26:29.620 --> 26:31.340]  It does look like he's giving him an exam.
[26:31.680 --> 26:32.300]  Mr. Perfect.
[26:34.960 --> 26:35.320]  Earthquake!
[26:35.720 --> 26:36.040]  Dang.
[26:36.800 --> 26:40.140]  Oh, here we have Sensational Queen Sherry.
[26:41.300 --> 26:42.580]  She looks like she was in Cats.
[26:42.680 --> 26:43.480]  Yeah, she looks like she was in Cats.
[26:43.540 --> 26:45.220]  That's actually not... that's a tattoo.
[26:47.160 --> 26:49.180]  Cats is a dog shit musical in my opinion.
[26:49.380 --> 26:50.000]  Never saw it.
[26:50.580 --> 26:51.800]  I saw it when I was younger.
[26:52.060 --> 26:55.140]  I think if you're gonna see it on the play version for sure.
[26:55.200 --> 26:56.440]  But it's like an Andrew Lloyd Webber one.
[26:56.520 --> 26:58.980]  But I would say it's... there's only like two good songs in it.
[26:59.460 --> 27:00.020]  Rowdy Rowdy Piper.
[27:00.120 --> 27:00.700]  He's dead.
[27:01.760 --> 27:06.040]  Ronda Rousey has taken over his moniker in wrestling, and now she wears the kilt and does that.
[27:06.780 --> 27:09.080]  He was originally... died of diverticulitis.
[27:09.080 --> 27:10.960]  His friends called him Rowdy Rowdy Pooper until he died.
[27:11.180 --> 27:12.260]  You have diverticulitis.
[27:12.400 --> 27:12.820]  I made that up.
[27:13.060 --> 27:14.020]  No, I do.
[27:14.140 --> 27:14.760]  I made that part up.
[27:14.940 --> 27:15.680]  The Bushwhackers.
[27:16.440 --> 27:17.000]  That's you.
[27:17.120 --> 27:17.940]  That was you and Gavin.
[27:18.160 --> 27:18.720]  Yeah, that's Gavin.
[27:19.480 --> 27:21.300]  Oh, here's Hacksaw Jim Duggan.
[27:21.520 --> 27:22.340]  There's his hacksaw.
[27:22.460 --> 27:24.280]  He is from 18 Kids and Counting.
[27:24.800 --> 27:25.540]  He's in jail now.
[27:26.920 --> 27:27.140]  What?
[27:27.760 --> 27:28.160]  Oh!
[27:28.480 --> 27:29.020]  Duggan Duggar.
[27:29.040 --> 27:30.240]  We're making up facts, remember?
[27:31.200 --> 27:31.600]  Earthquake!
[27:32.420 --> 27:34.040]  That is quite the forehead.
[27:34.420 --> 27:34.640]  Yeah.
[27:34.780 --> 27:35.440]  It's a ten head.
[27:38.860 --> 27:39.260]  Okay.
[27:41.280 --> 27:42.140]  Move mail back.
[27:42.160 --> 27:42.820]  Forget I have it.
[27:43.040 --> 27:43.540]  Let's see what we have.
[27:43.620 --> 27:44.700]  We did that box.
[27:44.860 --> 27:45.480]  What is this box?
[27:45.580 --> 27:47.000]  We got so much mail from people.
[27:47.280 --> 27:49.200]  Oh, I'm excited about this one.
[27:49.640 --> 27:51.840]  Uh, ooh, cool.
[27:52.560 --> 27:55.700]  This one says, hey fuckers, happy holidays.
[27:55.940 --> 27:57.260]  Here's a little something for the show.
[27:57.400 --> 27:58.340]  Love, Megan.
[27:58.880 --> 27:59.880]  Uh, thank you so much.
[28:00.540 --> 28:02.480]  We have here...
[28:02.480 --> 28:02.620]  Hey!
[28:02.960 --> 28:04.100]  Yeah, it's from your girlfriend.
[28:04.420 --> 28:05.320]  The Ghostwhisperer.
[28:05.420 --> 28:07.260]  Ooh, spooky.
[28:07.640 --> 28:10.120]  Uh, we have, uh, Branson on stage.
[28:10.200 --> 28:10.460]  Yes!
[28:10.900 --> 28:13.820]  And then Beach Warmer lady cards.
[28:13.880 --> 28:14.920]  Ooh, that says...
[28:14.920 --> 28:15.700]  No nudity.
[28:15.840 --> 28:16.880]  No nudity.
[28:17.160 --> 28:17.940]  That means it's fake.
[28:17.960 --> 28:18.460]  All nudity.
[28:19.840 --> 28:23.240]  Dang, this is where he sees, like, some of those 90s fake tits.
[28:23.480 --> 28:24.980]  We'll put that in the pack sack.
[28:25.000 --> 28:25.520]  Bank, bank.
[28:25.520 --> 28:27.480]  Be a nice surprise down the road.
[28:28.120 --> 28:28.960]  Uh, ooh!
[28:29.780 --> 28:30.540]  Everybody's favorite.
[28:30.880 --> 28:33.280]  It's probably big in your world, when you were a kid growing up.
[28:33.360 --> 28:34.100]  Boxcar Willie.
[28:35.260 --> 28:36.520]  You remember Boxcar Willie?
[28:37.040 --> 28:37.180]  No.
[28:37.620 --> 28:37.900]  Should I?
[28:37.900 --> 28:39.400]  I want to go to Branson so bad.
[28:39.460 --> 28:40.560]  I want to go to Silver Dollar City.
[28:41.420 --> 28:42.500]  I know Fire in the Hole is...
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.420]  Branson is like, uh, the super, like, Christian Nashville.
[28:48.020 --> 28:48.340]  Mm-hmm.
[28:48.420 --> 28:48.940]  Kind of, yeah.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.280]  But there's, uh, it was near where my grandma lived.
[28:51.360 --> 28:55.460]  And so we'd go there to Silver Dollar City, which is like their theme park.
[28:55.520 --> 28:57.740]  But the theme is, like, Ozarks and hillbillies.
[28:57.760 --> 28:58.700]  And it rules.
[28:58.700 --> 29:04.940]  Uh, being reared on country music, freight trains, and hobos would have a definite effect on a young boy.
[29:05.140 --> 29:09.700]  And for one young Texan, those early years would someday be the kind of things legends are made of.
[29:10.100 --> 29:15.480]  Born in the small town of Starrett, Texas, Boxcar Willie could rattle off country lyrics before he could even talk in complete sentences.
[29:15.880 --> 29:19.740]  His daddy, a railroad man, would fiddle for the family at the day's end.
[29:19.840 --> 29:20.420]  Yada, yada, yada.
[29:20.700 --> 29:20.860]  Okay.
[29:21.120 --> 29:21.340]  Uh-huh.
[29:21.480 --> 29:21.820]  Ooh, there's...
[29:21.820 --> 29:22.960]  A lot of, like, family bands.
[29:23.020 --> 29:26.680]  Rodney Dillard making a... it's definitely a Rodney face.
[29:26.820 --> 29:27.100]  He's Dillon.
[29:28.660 --> 29:29.620]  He's like...
[29:29.620 --> 29:31.280]  Are we keeping all Dill names?
[29:31.800 --> 29:32.740]  We should keep all Dill names.
[29:32.900 --> 29:33.480]  That's a good Dill.
[29:33.640 --> 29:34.600]  That's a Dill name, thank you.
[29:34.960 --> 29:36.000]  Bonnie Owens.
[29:36.680 --> 29:37.160]  Hey.
[29:37.740 --> 29:39.900]  She looks like, uh, from, uh...
[29:39.900 --> 29:41.780]  Mama said don't, but I didn't anyway.
[29:43.100 --> 29:43.580]  Misbehavin'.
[29:43.580 --> 29:45.180]  Uh, The Strangers.
[29:46.000 --> 29:46.120]  Hey.
[29:46.500 --> 29:46.960]  Ooh.
[29:47.980 --> 29:48.680]  Jim Owen.
[29:49.600 --> 29:50.420]  Dude, that's you.
[29:50.720 --> 29:51.880]  Playing baseball in his, uh...
[29:51.880 --> 29:52.380]  I need that.
[29:52.500 --> 29:52.960]  Tassels.
[29:53.360 --> 29:54.360]  What's it say on the end of his bat?
[29:54.880 --> 29:56.280]  Uh, it says...
[29:57.760 --> 29:58.200]  Yeah.
[29:58.260 --> 30:00.020]  Jim has truly had a storied career.
[30:01.140 --> 30:03.560]  He said all of his dreams have come true.
[30:04.760 --> 30:06.120]  He played for the Nashville Pickers.
[30:06.840 --> 30:07.880]  We'll open that one last.
[30:08.400 --> 30:08.840]  Uh, show them the last.
[30:08.920 --> 30:09.580]  Mo Brady.
[30:10.260 --> 30:11.580]  Everybody loves Mo Brady.
[30:12.180 --> 30:12.920]  Mickey Gilly.
[30:13.560 --> 30:13.780]  Oh.
[30:13.940 --> 30:15.020]  Everybody loved Mickey Gilly.
[30:16.000 --> 30:17.180]  Michelle and McGrath.
[30:17.260 --> 30:18.080]  First name, last name.
[30:18.720 --> 30:21.180]  Dude, I would buy a house from Christy Lane.
[30:21.380 --> 30:21.780]  Oh, yeah.
[30:21.840 --> 30:23.740]  She looks like a fucking badass real estate agent.
[30:23.740 --> 30:23.880]  Yeah.
[30:24.560 --> 30:25.880]  She's gonna get you the best deal.
[30:25.880 --> 30:27.420]  Yeah, that's a perm that is just...
[30:27.420 --> 30:28.640]  How does a perm happen?
[30:29.620 --> 30:32.440]  You, it's like chemicals, and it like, uh...
[30:32.440 --> 30:33.180]  It's called a permanent.
[30:33.580 --> 30:39.120]  And so you roll it, you get wet, and then you put this solution on it that makes it stay in that shape.
[30:39.280 --> 30:42.880]  And then you put this other stuff to neutralize it, and then the hair is like kind of locked into that form.
[30:43.020 --> 30:44.600]  How many perms have you given?
[30:44.880 --> 30:49.060]  I have been a hairstylist for, uh, almost 18 years.
[30:49.320 --> 30:52.240]  And including beauty school, I never did a real perm.
[30:52.380 --> 30:53.360]  I refuse to do them.
[30:53.420 --> 30:54.140]  They're too fucking scary.
[30:54.140 --> 30:57.320]  When you're in beauty school, you can do it on a mannequin, and then you just do water, and be like,
[30:57.540 --> 31:00.500]  okay, this is solution, this is neutralizer, like I acted it out.
[31:00.780 --> 31:04.200]  And then I was able to refuse doing them, and so I've never done them.
[31:04.340 --> 31:08.400]  Because they, when you learn about them, like, you can melt the hair off in like a second.
[31:08.720 --> 31:09.520]  Can you give me a perm?
[31:09.840 --> 31:10.240]  I could.
[31:10.900 --> 31:14.480]  If you're gonna be my first perm, I could do that.
[31:14.500 --> 31:17.360]  But I'd have to do the really teeny tiny rods.
[31:18.340 --> 31:19.520]  Because my hair's not long enough?
[31:19.880 --> 31:22.340]  We'd have to let it grow out a little bit.
[31:22.420 --> 31:22.660]  Yeah.
[31:23.080 --> 31:24.840]  Yeah, we could figure it out.
[31:25.380 --> 31:26.300]  Who could forget...
[31:26.300 --> 31:27.120]  It'd look so cute.
[31:27.300 --> 31:28.000]  It'd just be a little...
[31:28.000 --> 31:33.720]  Who could forget everybody's favorite, I guess, band, the Baldnobbers.
[31:34.120 --> 31:34.860]  Yes, they're huge.
[31:34.980 --> 31:38.760]  They have like a whole, like, they're like one of the biggest people there.
[31:38.860 --> 31:39.700]  Like, it's like a...
[31:39.700 --> 31:41.060]  You know of the Baldnobbers?
[31:41.140 --> 31:41.340]  Yeah.
[31:41.620 --> 31:43.840]  Like, it's one of the, it's like a big show.
[31:44.120 --> 31:44.900]  17 of them.
[31:45.680 --> 31:50.740]  This guy right here, oh my god, so my, yes, this is who my grandma had a VHS of their performance.
[31:51.240 --> 31:54.660]  And this guy right here, he didn't have any teeth.
[31:54.720 --> 32:00.540]  And so his whole thing was like that he was like wacky and it's like, you know when they don't have any teeth, it makes their mouth all crazy.
[32:01.000 --> 32:05.700]  Yeah, I think it was like one of the three VHSes that she had at her house.
[32:06.020 --> 32:06.420]  Hell yeah.
[32:06.620 --> 32:07.580]  Save that for you.
[32:08.900 --> 32:11.000]  And that's who your first crush was, you were saying?
[32:11.220 --> 32:11.900]  A little bit.
[32:12.000 --> 32:12.540]  Your little girl.
[32:12.900 --> 32:19.940]  No, I think it was something where it was like, my dad said like, oh, that guy is a distant, you know, cousin or some shit.
[32:19.940 --> 32:21.260]  So you were...
[32:21.260 --> 32:24.060]  Yeah, see look, there's their venue and stuff.
[32:24.160 --> 32:25.680]  So your first crush was your cousin?
[32:26.080 --> 32:27.420]  Well, that is the Hatfield in me.
[32:28.000 --> 32:29.560]  So are you like 2% bold number?
[32:30.020 --> 32:31.180]  I get, I hope so.
[32:31.320 --> 32:32.120]  That's why I married her.
[32:32.460 --> 32:32.940]  J.F.?
[32:33.560 --> 32:37.080]  Uh, take us, oh wait, sorry, Great Ghost Whisperer.
[32:37.400 --> 32:42.020]  Uh, Ghost Whisperer was a show where Party of Five talked to ghosts.
[32:42.360 --> 32:43.680]  Right? Did you watch it?
[32:44.140 --> 32:44.420]  No.
[32:45.400 --> 32:47.600]  Take us out to the ballgame, she said.
[32:47.860 --> 32:48.260]  Sports.
[32:48.260 --> 32:50.480]  And then she said, let's have a family reunion.
[32:50.480 --> 32:51.640]  And she looked in the background.
[32:51.780 --> 32:52.020]  She was...
[32:52.020 --> 32:52.620]  Oh, is that a Sam?
[32:52.620 --> 32:53.400]  I disapprove.
[32:54.060 --> 32:56.520]  Oh, here's the Lost Souls of the Light.
[32:56.700 --> 32:57.880]  That lady has a...
[32:57.880 --> 32:58.760]  Why's she gone crispy?
[32:58.960 --> 32:59.800]  She's got...
[32:59.800 --> 33:01.340]  She have that stuff from Game of Thrones?
[33:01.780 --> 33:03.780]  Oh, she's got stone skin, stone scale.
[33:04.020 --> 33:04.320]  Greyscale?
[33:04.560 --> 33:05.000]  Greyscale.
[33:05.220 --> 33:05.480]  What?
[33:05.960 --> 33:06.860]  Two ghosts in one.
[33:07.800 --> 33:09.060]  Oh, there's old Ned Banks.
[33:09.180 --> 33:10.900]  Everybody remembers Ned Banks.
[33:11.220 --> 33:14.440]  And then here's Jennifer Love Hewitt as Melinda Gordon.
[33:14.980 --> 33:16.620]  Ghost Whisperer, MD.
[33:17.760 --> 33:26.320]  Do you think there was a single person on Earth clamoring for Ghost Whisperer cards when they were made?
[33:26.440 --> 33:28.440]  I think a lot of people were really into that show.
[33:29.160 --> 33:29.540]  Interesting.
[33:29.680 --> 33:30.220]  When was that show?
[33:31.760 --> 33:32.710]  Probably early 2000s.
[33:33.140 --> 33:33.280]  Early 2000s?
[33:33.280 --> 33:33.480]  Yeah.
[33:33.600 --> 33:35.620]  Were you into the Ghost Whisperer?
[33:35.740 --> 33:36.440]  Did you want...
[33:36.440 --> 33:37.140]  Did you collect Ghost...
[33:37.140 --> 33:38.800]  Did you be, like, completionist with the Ghost Whisperer?
[33:38.800 --> 33:39.100]  I bet it's...
[33:39.100 --> 33:39.900]  Let us know in the chat.
[33:39.940 --> 33:41.720]  I bet it's the same people that like Umbrella Academy.
[33:42.360 --> 33:43.580]  To me, they're the same show.
[33:44.060 --> 33:45.000]  Same kind of vibe.
[33:45.000 --> 33:47.000]  I don't think that's the case at all, probably.
[33:47.100 --> 33:48.460]  I've never seen either one.
[33:48.780 --> 33:49.380]  As somebody who...
[33:49.380 --> 33:49.900]  But I get the same feeling.
[33:49.920 --> 33:51.640]  I can't imagine that they would be...
[33:51.640 --> 33:53.080]  Oh, because you like the Umbrella Whisperer?
[33:53.160 --> 33:54.160]  The Umbrella Academy.
[33:54.200 --> 33:54.860]  The Umbrella Academy.
[33:57.160 --> 33:58.200]  Gavin, these are for you.
[33:58.500 --> 34:00.220]  I opened up a couple packs of Game of Thrones.
[34:00.260 --> 34:00.900]  Why are they for me, though?
[34:01.140 --> 34:02.160]  Because you're from there.
[34:02.260 --> 34:02.980]  Because you're British.
[34:03.140 --> 34:03.420]  Oh, okay.
[34:03.680 --> 34:05.080]  This is your history.
[34:06.140 --> 34:06.340]  Right?
[34:06.880 --> 34:07.720]  Like Peter Dinklage?
[34:08.360 --> 34:09.180]  He was American.
[34:09.300 --> 34:10.580]  You're from Westeros, right?
[34:10.720 --> 34:11.080]  All right.
[34:11.380 --> 34:12.000]  Jon Snow?
[34:12.300 --> 34:12.500]  Hey!
[34:13.020 --> 34:13.640]  Arya Stark.
[34:13.640 --> 34:13.920]  Arya Stark.
[34:13.920 --> 34:14.780]  Also because it's fucking...
[34:14.780 --> 34:15.440]  It's something you've seen.
[34:15.560 --> 34:16.700]  You don't know shit about basketball.
[34:16.920 --> 34:17.220]  That's true.
[34:18.580 --> 34:19.280]  That's very true.
[34:19.320 --> 34:19.840]  Throw stuff your way.
[34:19.880 --> 34:21.060]  You can talk about, you little asshole.
[34:22.400 --> 34:24.020]  All right, here's Peter Dinklage.
[34:24.260 --> 34:25.100]  I'm here to help.
[34:25.440 --> 34:28.600]  Bald Knobbers have been performing in Branson since 1959.
[34:29.240 --> 34:29.660]  Jesus Christ.
[34:29.660 --> 34:32.060]  We're going to that show whenever we go to Silver Dollar City.
[34:32.440 --> 34:33.180]  Yon Royce.
[34:33.240 --> 34:33.840]  He's got some Rockettes.
[34:34.200 --> 34:35.920]  Oh, there's Peter Littlefinger Baelish.
[34:36.140 --> 34:36.480]  The Rockettes are the best.
[34:37.020 --> 34:38.780]  They called him Littlefinger because he had a small wiener.
[34:38.940 --> 34:39.700]  Is that why it was?
[34:39.760 --> 34:40.460]  Yeah, I believe so.
[34:41.100 --> 34:42.600]  And then that other guy didn't have a wiener.
[34:43.100 --> 34:43.640]  That's true.
[34:44.020 --> 34:45.760]  A lot of dudes don't.
[34:46.200 --> 34:48.560]  Are you ready to talk about what happened to you?
[34:48.560 --> 34:48.940]  About Gavin?
[34:49.160 --> 34:50.160]  No, that's his story.
[34:50.520 --> 34:51.240]  Edmond Tully.
[34:51.920 --> 34:52.860]  Or Edmer Tully.
[34:53.960 --> 34:55.900]  There's that time that that guy read that thing.
[34:56.300 --> 34:58.500]  That's the guy whose signed card we got.
[34:58.640 --> 34:58.840]  Yeah.
[34:59.260 --> 35:00.020]  And then there's a...
[35:00.020 --> 35:00.380]  Yeah, it is.
[35:00.460 --> 35:01.560]  And then there's Alma Wife.
[35:02.220 --> 35:03.620]  She's like, I got a serious bob.
[35:03.720 --> 35:05.900]  And here she's like, my name's Yara Greyjoy.
[35:06.120 --> 35:08.000]  It's actually Asha in the book,
[35:08.060 --> 35:09.980]  but they thought that sounded too much like another name,
[35:10.100 --> 35:12.480]  so they changed it in the movie and nobody told anyone.
[35:12.480 --> 35:14.380]  And Geoff thought my name was Asha the whole time,
[35:14.460 --> 35:16.200]  because he read the books and he kept referring to me as Asha,
[35:16.340 --> 35:18.040]  and nobody understood who he was talking about.
[35:18.120 --> 35:20.360]  And then we found out, after the show was over,
[35:20.460 --> 35:21.220]  what the mistake was.
[35:21.500 --> 35:24.720]  Does Theon grab her by the growler in the...
[35:24.720 --> 35:25.560]  You mean Theon right there?
[35:25.840 --> 35:25.980]  Hey!
[35:27.860 --> 35:29.980]  He doesn't have a dick after a while, too, right?
[35:30.160 --> 35:31.800]  Yeah, he got cut off a bunch, I think.
[35:31.840 --> 35:32.920]  And then he ate it like a sausage.
[35:33.540 --> 35:34.100]  Did he eat it?
[35:34.700 --> 35:36.320]  Didn't the little torture guy do it?
[35:36.320 --> 35:36.940]  I thought they sent it in the mail.
[35:37.520 --> 35:39.740]  I remember it going to his sister in the mail or something, right?
[35:39.880 --> 35:40.740]  Yeah, or his dad or something.
[35:40.760 --> 35:41.380]  Or his dad or something.
[35:41.380 --> 35:43.100]  I don't know. I watch it once and then never again.
[35:45.160 --> 35:47.100]  Let's open up a pack of Topps Chrome.
[35:48.520 --> 35:49.660]  And then we'll see what we get.
[35:49.900 --> 35:53.300]  We got a Michael Taglia-based rookie.
[35:53.520 --> 35:56.520]  Ooh, Aaron Judge, 35th Anniversary Paralympian.
[35:56.820 --> 35:57.180]  Dangers.
[35:57.300 --> 35:57.820]  We'll do those.
[35:58.580 --> 36:00.220]  Dansby Swanson, that's a great baseball name.
[36:00.320 --> 36:00.960]  We've talked about that.
[36:01.160 --> 36:03.120]  Giancarlo Stanton, that's a pretty good baseball name.
[36:04.120 --> 36:04.480]  He's...
[36:05.100 --> 36:05.460]  Wee!
[36:05.660 --> 36:06.700]  I did it! I did it!
[36:06.720 --> 36:08.720]  I did it! I'm running, I'm skipping to the side.
[36:08.760 --> 36:10.240]  Sometimes when they run, they skip to the side
[36:10.240 --> 36:11.020]  when they're really excited.
[36:11.140 --> 36:12.320]  Sometimes they skip to the loo.
[36:14.760 --> 36:16.320]  Let's open up one more piece.
[36:16.320 --> 36:17.080]  Oh wait, this one.
[36:18.180 --> 36:19.520]  Oh, but we need the drumroll for this one.
[36:19.600 --> 36:20.560]  Oh, oh, ooh.
[36:20.660 --> 36:22.100]  You guys want to get historical again?
[36:22.360 --> 36:22.460]  Yeah.
[36:22.620 --> 36:23.600]  It's the end of the year, right? Fuck it.
[36:23.880 --> 36:26.760]  We got a minute to kill on my drumroll, but he can do this for a whole minute.
[36:30.820 --> 36:34.540]  I reckon this will be a chipped piece of the Sphinx.
[36:34.860 --> 36:36.120]  I think that this is...
[36:36.120 --> 36:36.940]  Maybe it's its nose.
[36:37.360 --> 36:39.140]  I think it's... I think it's going to be a female.
[36:39.140 --> 36:40.160]  Oh, okay.
[36:41.240 --> 36:41.960]  All right.
[36:42.800 --> 36:44.680]  We still got 42 seconds.
[36:44.880 --> 36:45.900]  41, 40.
[36:47.560 --> 36:48.360]  Where's the light?
[36:48.620 --> 36:49.320]  Do you have like a choir?
[36:49.500 --> 36:50.340]  Oh, there's no light in this one.
[36:50.780 --> 36:51.160]  It doesn't work.
[36:52.860 --> 36:53.820]  Two people.
[36:54.460 --> 36:55.140]  We got...
[36:57.240 --> 36:59.380]  Oh my God, I can't read it. It's too small.
[37:00.420 --> 37:01.380]  We got...
[37:01.380 --> 37:01.980]  25 seconds.
[37:02.440 --> 37:04.580]  Augustus Caesar and Julius Caesar.
[37:05.180 --> 37:05.640]  Dang!
[37:07.040 --> 37:08.640]  You were just talking about wanting Augustus.
[37:08.640 --> 37:10.680]  Emily wanted Augustus, and there you go.
[37:10.760 --> 37:12.560]  There's Julius, and there's Augustus.
[37:12.640 --> 37:13.520]  Is that part of... wait.
[37:13.780 --> 37:14.380]  July and August.
[37:15.060 --> 37:16.820]  And there's their clothes right there.
[37:17.120 --> 37:17.740]  So it's...
[37:18.480 --> 37:25.780]  The images below are the authentic, original, and genuine items that the Guarantor by Super Products...
[37:25.780 --> 37:26.740]  So it's from the same outfit.
[37:27.060 --> 37:28.060]  We're putting his outfit together.
[37:28.280 --> 37:29.540]  Yeah, it's the same outfit.
[37:30.000 --> 37:30.440]  Dang!
[37:31.080 --> 37:31.720]  Where's the piece?
[37:32.340 --> 37:32.840]  Oh, there it is.
[37:33.040 --> 37:33.360]  Dang!
[37:33.360 --> 37:34.280]  You have to pull our outfit.
[37:34.500 --> 37:35.420]  We have so much Caesar.
[37:35.540 --> 37:37.160]  Well, Augustus is just fucking plain.
[37:37.880 --> 37:41.000]  Julius has got... looks like it's taken some battle damage.
[37:41.580 --> 37:41.980]  Dang!
[37:42.820 --> 37:44.120]  Is he the one that got stabbed?
[37:44.860 --> 37:45.280]  Julius Caesar?
[37:45.420 --> 37:46.280]  What happened with Augustus?
[37:46.360 --> 37:47.160]  Nothing happened to Julius.
[37:47.260 --> 37:47.620]  He was fine.
[37:47.680 --> 37:48.500]  He lived a long age.
[37:49.120 --> 37:50.480]  That looks like metal.
[37:51.120 --> 37:52.300]  It does look like... it probably is.
[37:53.780 --> 37:54.060]  Oh, wait.
[37:54.160 --> 37:55.040]  Julius Caesar and Augustus.
[37:56.140 --> 37:56.540]  I...
[37:56.540 --> 37:57.260]  Wow.
[37:57.540 --> 37:58.520]  My favorite thing about...
[37:58.520 --> 37:59.840]  My favorite thing about this...
[37:59.840 --> 38:01.020]  I didn't know there were two different Caesars.
[38:02.300 --> 38:03.800]  Augustus Caesar and Julius Caesar?
[38:04.300 --> 38:07.060]  By the time we got to Rome on our trip, Geoff was pretty checked out.
[38:07.100 --> 38:08.700]  He was like, I don't know if I can do any more tours.
[38:09.300 --> 38:11.400]  So you just didn't learn about Rome?
[38:12.100 --> 38:13.900]  No, I had Texas public school education.
[38:15.040 --> 38:16.540]  They were like, don't worry about it.
[38:16.580 --> 38:18.080]  It wasn't that I didn't want to do any more tours.
[38:18.280 --> 38:20.080]  I just... I had had enough churches.
[38:20.980 --> 38:21.300]  Yeah.
[38:21.540 --> 38:22.480]  Get pretty samey.
[38:22.820 --> 38:24.020]  Yeah, they get pretty samey after you.
[38:24.320 --> 38:24.500]  Wow.
[38:24.740 --> 38:25.640]  Here's the big church in Venice.
[38:25.840 --> 38:26.860]  Here's the big church in Florence.
[38:27.140 --> 38:28.980]  Here's the big church on the way to Rome.
[38:29.260 --> 38:30.200]  Here's the big church in Rome.
[38:30.340 --> 38:31.020]  Oh, guess what?
[38:31.080 --> 38:32.480]  There's 80 other churches in Rome.
[38:32.480 --> 38:34.720]  Maybe you should go again, but go straight to Rome.
[38:34.920 --> 38:36.380]  Yeah, so I have to be caught in Rome.
[38:36.560 --> 38:37.120]  Rome's the best.
[38:39.580 --> 38:39.980]  Wow.
[38:40.200 --> 38:41.100]  It was definitely my favorite place.
[38:41.120 --> 38:42.640]  This is an educational show, y'all.
[38:43.800 --> 38:46.140]  My favorite thing about Gavin is he doesn't believe that that's real at all.
[38:46.340 --> 38:47.980]  Julius got stabbed.
[38:48.500 --> 38:49.340]  So I was right.
[38:49.600 --> 38:52.640]  And Augustus killed Mark Antony and became emperor.
[38:53.680 --> 38:57.480]  Augustus killed Mark Antony and then Enrique Iglesias was able to come to power.
[38:57.480 --> 38:57.760]  That's true.
[38:58.440 --> 38:59.440]  He filled the void.
[38:59.820 --> 39:00.220]  Fowler!
[39:00.700 --> 39:00.940]  Who?
[39:00.940 --> 39:01.780]  Rodriguez!
[39:02.160 --> 39:02.280]  Who?
[39:03.080 --> 39:03.560]  Clemente!
[39:03.940 --> 39:05.100]  I can tell you who this is.
[39:05.360 --> 39:06.620]  This is Chris Fowler.
[39:06.740 --> 39:08.680]  He's a sports anchor.
[39:08.980 --> 39:10.140]  This is J-Rod.
[39:10.340 --> 39:11.500]  This is Roberto Clemente.
[39:11.560 --> 39:12.360]  He died in a plane crash.
[39:12.520 --> 39:12.740]  Really?
[39:12.920 --> 39:13.320]  Yeah.
[39:13.480 --> 39:14.400]  This is Greg Maddox.
[39:14.400 --> 39:15.120]  Oh, that's sad.
[39:15.320 --> 39:17.080]  This is probably Luis Castillo.
[39:17.720 --> 39:18.980]  This is Scott Rowland.
[39:19.180 --> 39:24.800]  Oh, here's a fucking Tyler Freeman black mini-parallel.
[39:24.840 --> 39:25.380]  That's cool.
[39:25.780 --> 39:27.940]  What do planes kill more of, athletes or musicians?
[39:30.100 --> 39:33.100]  Well, there would be like entire teams that were killed.
[39:33.340 --> 39:34.080]  Like, wasn't there...
[39:34.640 --> 39:39.660]  There was a soccer team that ate each other.
[39:40.180 --> 39:41.860]  Oh, the one in Yellow Jackets.
[39:41.900 --> 39:44.920]  And then the girls in Yellow Jackets, they ate each other, some of them.
[39:45.500 --> 39:47.240]  And they were a soccer team as well.
[39:48.080 --> 39:48.360]  I don't know.
[39:48.380 --> 39:48.920]  That's a good question.
[39:49.820 --> 39:50.620]  Big Bopper.
[39:51.760 --> 39:52.420]  Lynyrd Skynyrd.
[39:52.500 --> 39:53.240]  Richie Valens.
[39:53.340 --> 39:54.060]  Lynyrd Skynyrd.
[39:54.200 --> 39:54.760]  Patsy Cline.
[39:54.900 --> 39:55.720]  Patsy Cline.
[39:56.800 --> 39:57.320]  No.
[39:58.600 --> 39:59.640]  Buddy Holly.
[40:00.320 --> 40:01.120]  John Denver.
[40:01.380 --> 40:02.220]  John Denver.
[40:03.480 --> 40:05.700]  Yeah, I guess like, other than like teams...
[40:05.700 --> 40:06.780]  Almost Travis Barker.
[40:06.880 --> 40:07.540]  So close.
[40:07.820 --> 40:09.600]  Well, DJ AM eventually.
[40:09.940 --> 40:10.200]  Yeah.
[40:10.520 --> 40:11.340]  Ozzy Smith.
[40:11.740 --> 40:12.360]  He could flip.
[40:13.340 --> 40:14.200]  Casey Webb.
[40:14.580 --> 40:15.900]  He's got big old lobster.
[40:16.000 --> 40:16.180]  Oh, look at those paws.
[40:17.060 --> 40:17.720]  Here we go.
[40:17.720 --> 40:18.480]  Is he just a...
[40:18.480 --> 40:19.920]  This is Lobster Man.
[40:19.940 --> 40:20.560]  Seth Brown.
[40:20.920 --> 40:22.080]  You got lobsters alive in that picture?
[40:22.220 --> 40:24.120]  Oh, he's on Man vs. Food.
[40:25.140 --> 40:25.700]  Oh, here we go.
[40:25.700 --> 40:29.640]  Lance McCullers Jr. Relic card.
[40:29.780 --> 40:30.420]  That's cool.
[40:30.440 --> 40:31.880]  Is that a piece of his something in there?
[40:31.880 --> 40:32.860]  Yeah, it's a piece of his...
[40:32.860 --> 40:34.180]  This is just the new Man vs. Food guy.
[40:34.940 --> 40:35.640]  Oh, shit.
[40:36.020 --> 40:37.080]  Uh, that's cool.
[40:37.360 --> 40:40.600]  Uh, we got Ricky Small, and then Scott Rowland.
[40:40.660 --> 40:41.920]  And then we got a...
[40:41.920 --> 40:42.860]  Gir-Falcon.
[40:43.340 --> 40:43.520]  Oh.
[40:43.920 --> 40:44.920]  A Gyro-Falcon.
[40:45.100 --> 40:45.800]  Gir-Falcon.
[40:46.740 --> 40:47.580]  The Gir-Falcon.
[40:47.840 --> 40:52.880]  The Gir-Falcon, pronounced Jir-Falcon, is the largest falcon in the world.
[40:52.880 --> 40:57.120]  Its wings, while pointed, are more blunted than those of smaller falcons,
[40:57.220 --> 41:00.500]  with a powerful body and a relatively long tail.
[41:00.960 --> 41:04.920]  It's a fierce predator in the high Arctic, chasing down, uh,
[41:06.240 --> 41:08.400]  plamagrands in flight, or plum...
[41:08.400 --> 41:10.200]  What the fuck is a plam...plarmigan?
[41:10.680 --> 41:14.300]  Uh, in flight, or plummeting from the sky at breathtaking speeds
[41:14.300 --> 41:15.960]  to strike prey on the ground.
[41:16.180 --> 41:16.480]  We should get that.
[41:16.480 --> 41:20.640]  Should we throw in one, uh, Jir-Falcon to, uh, Falcons?
[41:21.120 --> 41:22.960]  Yeah, it's the biggest falcon of all.
[41:23.080 --> 41:23.680]  It's the biggest falcon.
[41:23.760 --> 41:24.640]  Like, one of them's big?
[41:25.540 --> 41:26.560]  He's the Gir-Falcon.
[41:26.580 --> 41:29.900]  Oh, like, we'll have a one-of-one Jir-Falcon that's huge, and we do our...
[41:29.900 --> 41:30.780]  Yeah, that's a great idea.
[41:30.900 --> 41:31.740]  Jir-Falcon.
[41:32.220 --> 41:35.660]  By the way, speaking of Jir-Falcon, and our falcon, and new merch coming out next year,
[41:36.240 --> 41:38.380]  uh, you don't have to wait till next year to buy merch.
[41:38.440 --> 41:41.060]  You could please buy the goddamn Sloppa-Clock-Clock.
[41:41.480 --> 41:42.140]  For God's sakes.
[41:42.140 --> 41:42.760]  We got one right there.
[41:43.140 --> 41:45.420]  You swore you'd buy it if we made enough.
[41:45.640 --> 41:47.120]  We made so many. Please.
[41:47.320 --> 41:48.520]  They're gonna go back to the show.
[41:48.520 --> 41:48.960]  It makes such a great gift.
[41:48.960 --> 41:51.340]  Three of things, and to earn it.
[41:51.640 --> 41:54.960]  What a great gift for anyone in your life that loves time.
[41:55.100 --> 41:59.160]  And if you're into time zones, you know, you could have, like, Tokyo Slop, you could have London Slop,
[41:59.220 --> 42:00.000]  you just have three of them.
[42:00.680 --> 42:02.220]  As long as you slop responsibly.
[42:02.620 --> 42:10.940]  Ronald Acuna Jr., Derek Jeter, Shohei Otani wearing the wrong uniform, uh, Charlie Blackmon.
[42:11.100 --> 42:13.900]  I feel like if you live in London, you need to have it set to Key West time.
[42:14.140 --> 42:14.640]  Well, maybe.
[42:15.080 --> 42:17.420]  You know, because then you know, you're like, oh shit, it's...
[42:17.420 --> 42:18.020]  Albert Pujols.
[42:18.020 --> 42:21.400]  Yeah, have one for your time zone and one for Key West time zone.
[42:21.540 --> 42:22.420]  Yeah, like the official.
[42:22.880 --> 42:25.840]  And if you live in Key West, just have two clocks with the same time.
[42:26.380 --> 42:26.780]  Yes.
[42:27.340 --> 42:27.780]  Say what now?
[42:27.860 --> 42:31.060]  No, no, have your second one set about two minutes behind,
[42:31.200 --> 42:34.760]  because then that's when it's, like, the webcam catches up.
[42:35.640 --> 42:38.440]  One for real time, one for stream time.
[42:38.580 --> 42:38.700]  Yeah.
[42:39.000 --> 42:40.220]  How about some Looney Tunes?
[42:41.880 --> 42:44.220]  Now, they had Looney Tunes in England when you were kids.
[42:44.300 --> 42:44.900]  Are you familiar with them?
[42:44.900 --> 42:45.360]  We had TV, yeah.
[42:45.820 --> 42:47.920]  Were they called Looney Tunes or were they called...
[42:47.920 --> 42:49.900]  They were called, like, funny heroes or something.
[42:50.020 --> 42:50.860]  Loopy Doopies?
[42:52.780 --> 42:54.460]  These are... okay, there we go.
[42:55.460 --> 42:59.840]  Oh boy, my first hit in the major wigs, or the minor wigs,
[42:59.960 --> 43:02.500]  or whatever wigs, for that matter, or any wigs.
[43:02.660 --> 43:04.200]  That was you when you hit your first hit.
[43:04.220 --> 43:06.780]  Years of diligence and self-denial, and I was like, I like that so much.
[43:06.780 --> 43:07.920]  Is this all Looney Tunes baseball?
[43:07.920 --> 43:10.320]  It's just all Looney Tunes, like, cute little cards.
[43:11.040 --> 43:12.260]  That was the Rockettes.
[43:13.760 --> 43:14.340]  Oh, the Cannon?
[43:14.340 --> 43:15.440]  Yeah, were they...
[43:15.900 --> 43:17.260]  After all, I'm a dog.
[43:17.660 --> 43:18.620]  Who the fuck is that?
[43:19.760 --> 43:20.980]  Who's the dog?
[43:21.700 --> 43:23.060]  Do you remember that dog?
[43:23.440 --> 43:23.680]  Dog?
[43:24.580 --> 43:25.440]  I remember that dog.
[43:25.920 --> 43:26.400]  Bugs Bunny.
[43:27.440 --> 43:28.800]  I cannot face the world.
[43:29.000 --> 43:30.960]  I think it's like, I cannot face the world.
[43:31.580 --> 43:33.200]  And then, there's that fucking dog again.
[43:33.920 --> 43:35.820]  Porky Pig is really cranking that one back.
[43:36.280 --> 43:36.520]  Yeah, he's...
[43:37.080 --> 43:37.780]  Here we go.
[43:38.700 --> 43:40.260]  Captain America movie train.
[43:40.380 --> 43:43.540]  Oh my God, it's already, like, almost time to do the shoe.
[43:43.540 --> 43:44.360]  Yeah, we'll get there.
[43:44.620 --> 43:47.240]  Wow, I just felt like we were just doing it for five minutes.
[43:47.380 --> 43:48.020]  Oh, Captain America.
[43:48.200 --> 43:50.100]  There's Agent Smith.
[43:50.220 --> 43:50.700]  Is that Deadpool?
[43:51.160 --> 43:53.820]  No, that's the Red Skull or whatever.
[43:54.180 --> 43:57.540]  Red Skull, who is recasting Avengers, I guess?
[43:57.680 --> 43:58.520]  How would you know?
[43:58.640 --> 43:59.740]  It has all makeup on.
[44:00.040 --> 44:01.360]  It's Hugh Lansing.
[44:01.480 --> 44:01.960]  Is that his name?
[44:02.640 --> 44:03.280]  He was in the first one?
[44:03.400 --> 44:03.900]  Hugo Weaver?
[44:04.180 --> 44:04.620]  Hugo Weaving?
[44:04.740 --> 44:05.420]  Hugo Weaving?
[44:05.560 --> 44:05.740]  Yeah.
[44:06.020 --> 44:06.380]  I got there.
[44:07.780 --> 44:08.140]  Lancer?
[44:08.220 --> 44:08.900]  Captain American.
[44:10.240 --> 44:11.480]  No, Lancer is what you use in...
[44:11.480 --> 44:12.160]  Captain American.
[44:13.220 --> 44:14.780]  Lancer is what you use in Gears of War.
[44:14.880 --> 44:15.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[44:15.480 --> 44:17.240]  I got cut in half by a couple of eggs.
[44:17.380 --> 44:18.420]  Iron Man and Captain America.
[44:19.840 --> 44:21.360]  Oh, here's Captain America with the Rockettes.
[44:21.420 --> 44:22.300]  We just saw them.
[44:22.420 --> 44:23.280]  Oh my God, it's the Rockettes.
[44:23.280 --> 44:24.300]  We just saw the Rockettes.
[44:24.420 --> 44:24.900]  There you go.
[44:25.240 --> 44:25.760]  Oh, jeez.
[44:25.760 --> 44:27.320]  And there's his dad.
[44:27.800 --> 44:29.920]  Well, actually, Iron Man's dad, Howard Stark.
[44:30.940 --> 44:33.140]  Is he the same dad as Captain America's dad?
[44:33.520 --> 44:34.760]  No, it's just Iron Man's dad.
[44:34.860 --> 44:36.000]  Captain America and Iron Man don't have the same dad.
[44:36.340 --> 44:36.700]  So...
[44:36.700 --> 44:39.740]  Captain America's super old, so he knew Iron Man's dad.
[44:39.820 --> 44:41.500]  Because Captain America was around in, like, the Cold War.
[44:43.360 --> 44:46.520]  No, he's like a super soldier because he had the super soldier serum.
[44:46.620 --> 44:48.460]  And then he was frozen in ice for a while.
[44:48.980 --> 44:50.160]  He didn't age because he was frozen.
[44:50.400 --> 44:52.200]  At any age, it did afterwards.
[44:56.300 --> 44:57.860]  That whole sentence was such a mess.
[44:57.860 --> 44:58.660]  That was a good one.
[44:58.720 --> 44:59.400]  From beginning to end.
[45:00.420 --> 45:00.640]  You all right?
[45:00.800 --> 45:01.040]  Yeah.
[45:01.200 --> 45:01.600]  Are you?
[45:05.160 --> 45:08.180]  Dude, we have so much shit to open here.
[45:08.240 --> 45:08.660]  Let's see.
[45:08.760 --> 45:09.140]  What do we got?
[45:09.220 --> 45:10.060]  What do we got?
[45:10.060 --> 45:13.440]  We gotta clean out the back of your phone, babe.
[45:14.220 --> 45:14.800]  What's wrong with my phone?
[45:15.100 --> 45:16.140]  Look at the back of it.
[45:16.600 --> 45:17.080]  It's pretty gammy.
[45:17.980 --> 45:19.180]  No, that's on the inside.
[45:20.100 --> 45:20.860]  Yeah, well, whatever.
[45:21.020 --> 45:22.120]  That's his...
[45:22.120 --> 45:22.620]  We'll fix it.
[45:23.000 --> 45:23.320]  ...design.
[45:23.700 --> 45:24.940]  All right, we're gonna open up one of these.
[45:25.220 --> 45:27.340]  Do you ever just take Geoff's phone and throw it over your head?
[45:27.560 --> 45:30.660]  I throw my phone at him, and I'm like, I don't wanna look at my phone anymore.
[45:30.980 --> 45:37.680]  And then I make him hold on to it because I need him to, for my own anxiety, to be like, okay, you're not missing anything.
[45:38.080 --> 45:39.360]  And it's like...
[45:39.360 --> 45:40.260]  I'm gonna let you guys pick.
[45:41.860 --> 45:42.260]  Pirates.
[45:42.840 --> 45:43.640]  Nolan Ryan.
[45:44.820 --> 45:45.620]  American Pride.
[45:46.220 --> 45:47.560]  Michigan State University.
[45:49.160 --> 45:50.500]  Guinness Book of World Records.
[45:51.940 --> 45:52.340]  Trolls.
[45:53.420 --> 45:54.220]  Pro Cheerleaders.
[45:57.680 --> 45:58.480]  Music USA.
[46:00.160 --> 46:00.960]  Street Sharks.
[46:01.980 --> 46:03.160]  We'll open up one of these.
[46:03.260 --> 46:05.040]  Okay, on the count of three, say which one you want.
[46:05.200 --> 46:05.340]  Okay.
[46:05.740 --> 46:06.800]  You need to do the count.
[46:06.980 --> 46:08.280]  Okay, one, two, three.
[46:08.280 --> 46:09.140]  Guinness World Records.
[46:12.740 --> 46:15.300]  Wow, I would not have guessed that you'd go for that one.
[46:15.360 --> 46:18.280]  Look at us. That's why you're gonna replace me once I die.
[46:20.540 --> 46:22.340]  But we still disagree about the table.
[46:22.780 --> 46:28.400]  That's still... we still... I don't know, but I need someone with physics to understand.
[46:29.060 --> 46:31.240]  And explain it for me in a very slow way.
[46:32.120 --> 46:33.640]  Should we explain it to the audience before we leave?
[46:33.740 --> 46:34.460]  Distant Stars.
[46:34.460 --> 46:38.080]  Yes, because then I'm gonna need someone... someone's gonna be really smart.
[46:38.300 --> 46:39.520]  That's a world record?
[46:40.260 --> 46:42.160]  Okay, I'll tell you what the Guinness Book of World Records is.
[46:42.600 --> 46:43.840]  Natural and Human World.
[46:53.120 --> 46:53.640]  Okay.
[46:56.560 --> 46:58.140]  Elementary Film Roll.
[46:58.560 --> 46:59.240]  What the fuck?
[47:00.060 --> 47:00.960]  Facts and Feats.
[47:01.220 --> 47:04.440]  The world's most portrayed character on the screen is...
[47:04.460 --> 47:05.080]  Sherlock Holmes.
[47:05.180 --> 47:07.800]  That's interesting. He's been in over 204 films.
[47:07.980 --> 47:10.260]  Played by approximately 72 actors.
[47:11.120 --> 47:12.500]  You've been a part of the... you filmed him.
[47:12.660 --> 47:15.840]  So you filmed the most filmed person ever.
[47:16.040 --> 47:17.200]  I filmed the Iron Man one.
[47:17.740 --> 47:18.220]  Congratulations.
[47:18.840 --> 47:21.180]  His dad created Captain America.
[47:22.260 --> 47:25.240]  Here's a world's longest snake.
[47:25.420 --> 47:27.640]  That's fucking gross. It's 32 feet long.
[47:28.060 --> 47:28.700]  Didn't like that.
[47:30.180 --> 47:31.120]  Why is he in there?
[47:31.200 --> 47:31.920]  That looks like Jimmy Buffett.
[47:31.920 --> 47:33.100]  Because he wants to die?
[47:34.540 --> 47:35.360]  It does look like Jimmy Buffett.
[47:35.360 --> 47:37.320]  Do you think it's his snake coming out of his crotch?
[47:40.360 --> 47:42.740]  Wasting away again inside a giant snake.
[47:43.780 --> 47:45.520]  The world's fastest steam train.
[47:45.660 --> 47:48.500]  Do you think if you were in that snake, could you push your way out?
[47:48.600 --> 47:48.740]  No.
[47:49.560 --> 47:50.880]  That'd be constricting the whole time.
[47:51.060 --> 47:52.740]  Yeah, but if you've already been swallowed.
[47:52.960 --> 47:54.100]  Maybe if I had a box cutter.
[47:57.680 --> 48:00.020]  The longest motorbike in the world was constructed.
[48:00.140 --> 48:00.500]  Okay.
[48:00.920 --> 48:01.780]  It's 12 feet long.
[48:02.000 --> 48:02.360]  There you go.
[48:02.820 --> 48:03.180]  Wow.
[48:03.180 --> 48:04.240]  That's the longest bike?
[48:04.360 --> 48:05.420]  We can make a longer bike than that.
[48:05.440 --> 48:06.580]  We can definitely make a longer bike than that.
[48:07.020 --> 48:08.240]  Here's a low high point.
[48:08.780 --> 48:08.980]  What?
[48:09.760 --> 48:10.080]  Okay.
[48:10.840 --> 48:12.860]  The world's flattest land.
[48:13.160 --> 48:17.300]  Or to be more precise, the country with the lowest high point in the world is the Maldives.
[48:17.740 --> 48:19.500]  Which reaches a heady summit of 8 feet.
[48:20.520 --> 48:20.920]  Wow.
[48:21.400 --> 48:22.180]  That's where I want to go.
[48:22.200 --> 48:22.880]  That's cool.
[48:23.080 --> 48:24.740]  That's before they put all the little huts around there.
[48:25.620 --> 48:26.560]  Officially the largest...
[48:26.560 --> 48:27.560]  Oh, this is a sad one.
[48:28.320 --> 48:34.520]  The world's largest area of rentable office space is the World Trade Center in New York.
[48:34.640 --> 48:39.480]  With 4.37 million square feet of rentable office space.
[48:40.320 --> 48:40.920]  Yikey.
[48:41.500 --> 48:43.280]  These cards aren't updated.
[48:44.300 --> 48:46.700]  The hottest known planet in the universe...
[48:46.700 --> 48:49.160]  Gavin, do you know the hottest known planet in the universe?
[48:49.780 --> 48:50.480]  In the universe?
[48:50.740 --> 48:50.920]  Yeah.
[48:51.060 --> 48:51.580]  I have no idea.
[48:52.540 --> 48:53.400]  Measured to date.
[48:53.560 --> 48:54.360]  Planet Blorgon.
[48:55.240 --> 48:56.680]  No, it's actually Venus.
[48:56.680 --> 48:58.520]  With 860 degrees Fahrenheit.
[48:58.740 --> 48:58.820]  In the galaxy?
[48:58.820 --> 48:59.200]  That's what they said.
[48:59.280 --> 48:59.960]  That's because she's a hottie.
[49:00.280 --> 49:01.080]  In the whole galaxy?
[49:01.260 --> 49:02.280]  That's what they'd known.
[49:02.820 --> 49:03.440]  That's what they said.
[49:03.440 --> 49:05.120]  That tends to be next to our planet.
[49:05.240 --> 49:06.140]  Fight with...
[49:06.140 --> 49:07.720]  Tapped in 1992.
[49:08.720 --> 49:11.840]  The world's first man to walk both poles was Robert Swan.
[49:12.040 --> 49:12.560]  There you go.
[49:13.060 --> 49:13.840]  He's a pole walker.
[49:13.880 --> 49:14.060]  Swan song.
[49:14.580 --> 49:15.320]  And then...
[49:15.320 --> 49:16.280]  Oh, you'll like this one, Gavin.
[49:16.340 --> 49:17.240]  This is your country.
[49:17.560 --> 49:22.340]  The world's highest test aggregate for a single match in cricket was achieved by Graham Gooch.
[49:22.840 --> 49:23.500]  The Goochster.
[49:24.480 --> 49:25.060]  The pooch.
[49:25.560 --> 49:26.460]  Is that a real name?
[49:27.040 --> 49:28.060]  Have you heard of Graham Gooch?
[49:28.660 --> 49:30.060]  No, but I've heard the name Gooch.
[49:30.460 --> 49:31.360]  Yeah, that's Eric's name.
[49:31.780 --> 49:35.040]  I didn't realize he was named after a famous athlete.
[49:35.700 --> 49:40.000]  Of England against India in 1990 where he scored an incredible 456 runs.
[49:40.180 --> 49:40.620]  Oh my God.
[49:41.120 --> 49:42.200]  The quadruple century.
[49:42.640 --> 49:43.040]  Wow.
[49:43.180 --> 49:43.940]  I don't even know what that means.
[49:44.700 --> 49:45.300]  Do you like cricket?
[49:46.720 --> 49:48.360]  In very tiny amounts.
[49:48.660 --> 49:49.700]  But doesn't it play forever?
[49:50.040 --> 49:51.980]  Well, a test match is like five days.
[49:52.540 --> 49:53.200]  Test match?
[49:53.340 --> 49:53.520]  Yeah.
[49:53.520 --> 49:54.380]  What's test match?
[49:54.660 --> 49:54.860]  Cricket.
[49:55.360 --> 49:56.040]  Oh, okay.
[49:56.600 --> 49:58.200]  But like, is that what they just call their games?
[49:58.740 --> 49:58.840]  Test match?
[49:58.840 --> 50:00.520]  Yeah, just like the...
[50:01.480 --> 50:02.180]  Well, yeah.
[50:02.540 --> 50:03.960]  That's just like a normal game.
[50:04.520 --> 50:05.100]  Test match.
[50:05.100 --> 50:06.100]  If you don't have 20-20.
[50:06.300 --> 50:09.040]  Test is usually like, we're just practicing.
[50:09.620 --> 50:10.680]  Yeah, they're not in the lab.
[50:10.820 --> 50:11.520]  Those are real games.
[50:12.280 --> 50:12.980]  Lab games.
[50:14.520 --> 50:15.400]  There's some cards.
[50:15.740 --> 50:16.520]  This is a...
[50:18.000 --> 50:18.690]  Oh, this is numbered...
[50:21.420 --> 50:21.880]  99.
[50:21.880 --> 50:22.240]  99.
[50:22.400 --> 50:26.900]  This is some sort of a red and orange wave parallel.
[50:27.260 --> 50:27.800]  That's pretty.
[50:28.000 --> 50:28.880]  Janus and Joker.
[50:29.460 --> 50:29.840]  Wow.
[50:30.020 --> 50:30.460]  That's a pretty card.
[50:30.540 --> 50:31.640]  Probably not worth anything, but it's a cool card.
[50:31.700 --> 50:31.980]  Could be.
[50:32.140 --> 50:34.500]  We'll open two more of these, and then we're gonna...
[50:34.500 --> 50:35.800]  Fuck with these other guys.
[50:36.920 --> 50:37.660]  To our shoe?
[50:38.180 --> 50:39.040]  Yeah, to our shoes.
[50:39.480 --> 50:39.860]  Mobamba.
[50:40.360 --> 50:41.100]  Christian Brown.
[50:41.340 --> 50:42.000]  Oh, here we go.
[50:42.240 --> 50:42.940]  Kevin Herter.
[50:43.200 --> 50:43.960]  Same kind of parallel.
[50:45.240 --> 50:46.000]  TJ Warren.
[50:46.220 --> 50:46.680]  One more.
[50:49.100 --> 50:51.680]  Who did the Celtics play this week?
[50:51.680 --> 50:53.620]  They play the Golden State Warriors tomorrow night.
[50:53.940 --> 50:54.780]  Not worried.
[50:55.180 --> 50:55.760]  Bam Adebayo.
[50:56.460 --> 50:57.100]  Oh, because they don't have Draymond Green, huh?
[50:57.100 --> 50:57.600]  Because they suck.
[50:57.940 --> 50:58.680]  Benedict Matherin.
[51:00.020 --> 51:00.900]  Jason Preston.
[51:01.040 --> 51:01.740]  Red wave parallel.
[51:02.940 --> 51:03.800]  And Chris Middleton.
[51:03.920 --> 51:09.080]  If Draymond Green was still playing with the Golden State Warriors, who on the Celtics do you think he would try to beat up?
[51:11.980 --> 51:13.700]  Didn't he and Jalen Brown get into it?
[51:14.100 --> 51:14.420]  In one of those...
[51:14.420 --> 51:17.320]  Yeah, he and Jalen Brown got into it last year in the finals.
[51:17.800 --> 51:18.620]  A little bit.
[51:19.580 --> 51:19.940]  Uh...
[51:21.080 --> 51:22.580]  Or not last year, year before last, I guess.
[51:22.880 --> 51:24.480]  I guess it'd be whoever's guarding him, huh?
[51:25.440 --> 51:27.440]  Yeah, it's like, I don't know.
[51:27.720 --> 51:29.360]  Peyton Pritchard, like the smallest guy in the...
[51:29.360 --> 51:29.660]  Hell yeah.
[51:29.780 --> 51:31.280]  Yeah, probably, and Peyton Pritchard wouldn't give a shit.
[51:33.420 --> 51:34.040]  Fuck him up.
[51:34.680 --> 51:36.580]  Should we open up the shoes or this bad boy?
[51:36.820 --> 51:38.160]  That bad boy and then the shoes.
[51:38.540 --> 51:39.180]  Yeah, this and the shoes.
[51:39.680 --> 51:42.400]  I feel so spoiled getting to open up three of these in one day.
[51:43.360 --> 51:46.480]  We're not gonna be here for two weeks because it's Christmas and New Year's.
[51:46.480 --> 51:50.020]  Yeah, I was gonna hold these and open them up like one a month or something, but I just can't.
[51:50.140 --> 51:54.940]  There is something I'm really excited for us to hopefully open up on our next show, which is in two weeks.
[51:55.040 --> 51:55.380]  Drum roll.
[51:55.940 --> 51:56.480]  Oh shit.
[51:57.040 --> 51:58.760]  Yeah, this is our last show of the year, right?
[51:59.520 --> 52:00.940]  You still got a minute to go.
[52:02.100 --> 52:04.060]  Oh yeah, it's like Christmas next week.
[52:04.600 --> 52:05.120]  Merry Christmas.
[52:08.080 --> 52:10.440]  Do you like giving gifts or receiving them better?
[52:10.740 --> 52:14.500]  I love to give presents, but I'm so bad.
[52:14.500 --> 52:18.240]  I want to be like, open it now, but I like to receive them.
[52:18.320 --> 52:21.920]  I like gifts that are thoughtful and well thought out.
[52:22.520 --> 52:23.320]  Well, the light works.
[52:23.840 --> 52:24.760]  That means it's gonna be good.
[52:25.360 --> 52:26.520]  That means it's from this century.
[52:29.180 --> 52:29.980]  You're gonna love it.
[52:30.060 --> 52:30.500]  I am?
[52:30.780 --> 52:31.280]  It's an Emily.
[52:31.340 --> 52:32.380]  Is it the Sphinx's eyebrow?
[52:33.000 --> 52:33.220]  Ready?
[52:33.620 --> 52:34.600]  How much time we got left?
[52:35.140 --> 52:36.160]  On my drum roll?
[52:36.300 --> 52:36.420]  Yeah.
[52:36.540 --> 52:37.200]  26 seconds.
[52:37.920 --> 52:38.900]  What am I gonna like?
[52:38.960 --> 52:39.600]  Who would I like?
[52:39.840 --> 52:40.520]  Is it a boy or a girl?
[52:42.240 --> 52:44.100]  It's Gucci and Prada.
[52:46.680 --> 52:47.880]  We have...
[52:49.360 --> 52:52.360]  A piece of authentic dual relics.
[52:52.860 --> 52:55.180]  A piece of Gucci gear.
[52:55.480 --> 52:56.180]  Gucci gear.
[52:56.640 --> 52:58.780]  Cloth fabric and a piece of Prada fabric.
[52:59.040 --> 53:00.220]  What do we say here?
[53:00.600 --> 53:01.600]  The image is below.
[53:02.180 --> 53:02.300]  Gucci.
[53:02.420 --> 53:02.780]  Gucci.
[53:02.880 --> 53:03.260]  Oh, Gucci.
[53:03.880 --> 53:05.000]  That was his name?
[53:06.320 --> 53:07.940]  I had no...
[53:07.940 --> 53:08.280]  Gucci.
[53:08.380 --> 53:08.720]  Oh, Gucci.
[53:08.720 --> 53:10.180]  We haven't seen that Gucci movie.
[53:10.400 --> 53:11.200]  Gucci, oh, Gucci.
[53:11.620 --> 53:12.820]  And then Mario Prada.
[53:13.180 --> 53:13.500]  Congratulations.
[53:13.760 --> 53:16.640]  The images below are authentic, original, and genuine items.
[53:16.920 --> 53:19.680]  So, if we were to buy enough of these, we could put these clothes back together.
[53:19.940 --> 53:20.380]  Hell yeah.
[53:20.640 --> 53:23.580]  You could wear your fancy watch and your Gucci and your Prada.
[53:23.640 --> 53:24.720]  Pop that on with your Patek Philippe.
[53:25.540 --> 53:26.800]  Yeah, there you go.
[53:26.900 --> 53:28.380]  I wonder what piece it's from.
[53:28.520 --> 53:29.860]  They show you on the back where it's from.
[53:30.080 --> 53:31.720]  Like, that one's from those pants, I guess?
[53:32.120 --> 53:33.040]  They're both pants.
[53:33.800 --> 53:34.940]  Pants, shoes, and a purse.
[53:35.060 --> 53:35.580]  Like, it could be from any of them?
[53:35.580 --> 53:36.400]  So, it could be from any of those.
[53:36.400 --> 53:37.400]  This is probably from the purse right here.
[53:37.860 --> 53:38.180]  Ooh.
[53:39.360 --> 53:39.680]  Dang.
[53:40.300 --> 53:41.240]  You finally got a Prada purse.
[53:41.440 --> 53:42.540]  Finally got a Prada purse.
[53:42.580 --> 53:42.920]  You're welcome.
[53:43.640 --> 53:44.200]  Gucci-o.
[53:45.320 --> 53:45.640]  Gucci.
[53:46.100 --> 53:46.580]  Gucci-o.
[53:47.160 --> 53:47.480]  Yeah.
[53:48.720 --> 53:50.540]  Those are from, like, newer ones, too.
[53:51.060 --> 53:51.400]  All right.
[53:53.080 --> 53:54.040]  Oh, I have the shoe.
[53:54.100 --> 53:54.540]  I have the shoe.
[53:54.960 --> 53:55.620]  All right, here we go.
[53:55.700 --> 53:56.500]  This is, uh...
[53:56.500 --> 53:59.120]  I've been wanting to fuck around with these shoes for a while.
[53:59.720 --> 54:00.280]  See what's up.
[54:00.400 --> 54:01.700]  Never opened up a pair of shoes before.
[54:01.780 --> 54:02.340]  It seems silly.
[54:02.940 --> 54:03.600]  This whole thing is silly.
[54:03.600 --> 54:04.700]  Are you gonna huff the shoe, do you think?
[54:04.820 --> 54:05.560]  I will smell the shoe.
[54:05.560 --> 54:06.280]  Will you do a shoey?
[54:07.800 --> 54:09.200]  Depends on who it is.
[54:09.500 --> 54:10.360]  Who do you think it is?
[54:10.400 --> 54:11.040]  Who do you want it to be?
[54:11.180 --> 54:12.380]  I want it to be Kobe Bryant.
[54:12.640 --> 54:13.860]  Okay, but who do you really think it is?
[54:14.260 --> 54:14.960]  I think it's Kobe Bryant.
[54:15.460 --> 54:16.600]  Who do you think it is?
[54:17.040 --> 54:17.900]  Um, Dillman.
[54:18.600 --> 54:23.420]  I'm gonna say, uh, Kenny from the NBA show we watch.
[54:24.100 --> 54:24.460]  Okay.
[54:25.740 --> 54:26.520]  What's his last name?
[54:26.820 --> 54:27.180]  Uh...
[54:27.180 --> 54:28.140]  Not Kenny Powers.
[54:28.500 --> 54:29.080]  He's baseball.
[54:32.620 --> 54:32.980]  Uh...
[54:32.980 --> 54:34.280]  This is probably another drum roll.
[54:34.320 --> 54:34.360]  What is his last name?
[54:34.420 --> 54:34.940]  Oh, shit.
[54:35.740 --> 54:36.300]  All right, here we go.
[54:36.300 --> 54:37.240]  We got a minute.
[54:42.130 --> 54:44.730]  Numbered, what was it, 23, 26 to 100?
[54:44.910 --> 54:45.630]  26 of 100.
[54:46.730 --> 54:47.530]  This is...
[54:48.170 --> 54:51.770]  gonna be an autographed shoe from an NBA player.
[54:51.930 --> 54:52.510]  Do you think it's Nike?
[54:52.510 --> 54:54.530]  Never opened anything up like this before.
[54:55.910 --> 54:56.690]  Oh, that's a good call.
[54:56.770 --> 54:57.950]  What brand is it gonna be?
[54:58.250 --> 54:59.750]  Nike, Adidas, Puma, Converse.
[54:59.770 --> 54:59.870]  Umbro.
[55:00.550 --> 55:00.950]  Umbro.
[55:01.130 --> 55:02.170]  I'm gonna go Nike.
[55:02.550 --> 55:05.070]  Nike, I think it's definitely probably gonna be Nike for anybody.
[55:05.210 --> 55:05.710]  Okay, here we go.
[55:06.090 --> 55:06.790]  Never done this before.
[55:06.790 --> 55:07.490]  This is...
[55:07.490 --> 55:08.710]  Thanks for...
[55:08.710 --> 55:11.450]  Hey, thanks for tuning in to all the Break Shows this year.
[55:11.590 --> 55:14.410]  This was the year that it went from being an occasional show to a weekly show...
[55:14.410 --> 55:15.690]  to a mostly weekly show.
[55:16.190 --> 55:19.210]  And I'm hoping to continue it in 2024 and make it even bigger and better.
[55:19.850 --> 55:22.730]  Hopefully to improve on the collections and have a lot more fun with it,
[55:22.790 --> 55:26.850]  get more stuff graded, do a better job of interacting with you, the audience,
[55:26.950 --> 55:27.390]  and vice versa.
[55:28.370 --> 55:29.730]  And I'm very excited for it.
[55:29.770 --> 55:30.330]  It was a wonderful year.
[55:30.390 --> 55:31.030]  Thank you very much.
[55:31.470 --> 55:35.910]  And I can't wait to see what our final big hit of the year is gonna be.
[55:40.450 --> 55:40.910]  Oh!
[55:43.450 --> 55:44.690]  It's in a bag.
[55:45.030 --> 55:45.610]  A shoe bag.
[55:46.030 --> 55:47.830]  You might want to look to see if you see the name.
[55:54.920 --> 55:56.160]  Any aroma coming?
[55:57.420 --> 55:58.260]  It's not Nike.
[55:58.740 --> 55:59.420]  It's not.
[55:59.660 --> 56:00.380]  It's a Gavin shoe.
[56:00.400 --> 56:00.780]  Whoa!
[56:01.740 --> 56:02.780]  It's a Converse?
[56:03.100 --> 56:03.860]  So it's a Converse.
[56:03.960 --> 56:05.560]  It's clearly a New York Knick.
[56:08.300 --> 56:10.300]  Let me see if I can figure it out.
[56:10.300 --> 56:11.280]  Yeah, see if you can figure it out.
[56:11.440 --> 56:11.980]  Based on the smell.
[56:17.610 --> 56:18.930]  Oh my God, you went deep!
[56:19.310 --> 56:20.030]  I don't think it's been worn.
[56:20.030 --> 56:20.590]  Do you think it's been worn?
[56:20.850 --> 56:22.370]  I think it's brand new.
[56:22.770 --> 56:23.690]  Yeah, that hasn't been worn.
[56:24.510 --> 56:26.070]  It is clearly...
[56:28.530 --> 56:29.250]  John Starks.
[56:29.370 --> 56:30.290]  Yeah! Oh my God!
[56:30.690 --> 56:31.170]  Is it really?
[56:31.290 --> 56:31.510]  Yeah!
[56:32.430 --> 56:33.990]  I don't know how to make this stop. Stop!
[56:35.590 --> 56:36.670]  What size is that?
[56:38.790 --> 56:39.510]  28? 11?
[56:39.770 --> 56:40.010]  Okay.
[56:40.250 --> 56:40.870]  You could wear that.
[56:40.990 --> 56:41.850]  I could wear it.
[56:41.950 --> 56:42.870]  All right, where are we going?
[56:42.870 --> 56:44.830]  Tell me about John Starks.
[56:45.410 --> 56:46.570]  He plays for the Knicks?
[56:46.810 --> 56:47.170]  He did.
[56:47.610 --> 56:48.910]  Yeah, he helped me a long time ago.
[56:49.670 --> 56:51.150]  He was made in Vietnam.
[56:52.090 --> 56:55.890]  John Starks was a locally popular dude in New York.
[56:56.390 --> 56:57.250]  Hard playing.
[56:58.310 --> 56:59.190]  Point guard.
[56:59.790 --> 57:00.750]  Played for the Knicks.
[57:01.710 --> 57:04.870]  I don't think he made the Hall of Fame or ever really...
[57:06.490 --> 57:07.170]  Try it on.
[57:08.350 --> 57:08.710]  A little bit.
[57:08.770 --> 57:09.950]  The tiniest bit of a letdown.
[57:10.390 --> 57:11.250]  But, you know, it's cool.
[57:11.390 --> 57:12.050]  We got John Starks.
[57:12.050 --> 57:13.790]  We'll just have to get more than a year.
[57:13.790 --> 57:14.710]  Everybody loves John Starks in New York.
[57:14.770 --> 57:15.490]  You want to put this on?
[57:15.690 --> 57:16.270]  Try it on.
[57:16.310 --> 57:17.010]  No, you can put it on.
[57:17.150 --> 57:17.450]  Try it on.
[57:17.530 --> 57:19.630]  I don't want to wreck a shoe.
[57:20.510 --> 57:21.090]  Wreck a shoe?
[57:21.150 --> 57:22.430]  It's a John Starks shoe.
[57:22.910 --> 57:25.050]  I don't even know who he is, but Geoff seems a little...
[57:25.050 --> 57:30.250]  Would you be open to wearing just one, like, odd shoes for the rest of the...
[57:30.250 --> 57:30.890]  Pop it up.
[57:31.690 --> 57:32.630]  That fits pretty good.
[57:35.030 --> 57:36.950]  Yeah, would you ever be an odd shoe guy?
[57:37.330 --> 57:37.570]  No.
[57:38.510 --> 57:39.290]  No, that seems like you.
[57:39.310 --> 57:41.850]  You wore your Vans for a long time that were more unique.
[57:42.050 --> 57:43.590]  Yeah, but they're not, like, different.
[57:44.130 --> 57:45.150]  What does yours say?
[57:45.250 --> 57:46.030]  Repulsive on it?
[57:46.210 --> 57:47.010]  Yeah, mine are repulsive.
[57:47.450 --> 57:47.850]  Repulsive.
[57:48.830 --> 57:51.190]  What's next year's word going to be for your shoe?
[57:51.830 --> 57:52.610]  Well, I just...
[57:52.610 --> 57:54.210]  I'm wearing repulsive because I retired filth.
[57:56.830 --> 57:57.510]  Repugnant, maybe?
[57:57.770 --> 57:58.590]  Oh, that's a good one.
[57:58.610 --> 57:59.010]  Pugsley?
[57:59.030 --> 57:59.390]  That's a good one.
[58:00.250 --> 58:01.210]  Well, there you go.
[58:01.310 --> 58:03.090]  Thanks for 2023.
[58:03.990 --> 58:04.670]  How exciting.
[58:05.750 --> 58:06.190]  John Starks.
[58:07.410 --> 58:08.130]  No, it's cool.
[58:08.550 --> 58:08.750]  Cool.
[58:08.850 --> 58:09.290]  I've never...
[58:09.290 --> 58:10.090]  Neat to open up a shoe.
[58:10.090 --> 58:11.090]  I'm surprised it wasn't a...
[58:11.830 --> 58:12.690]  I thought it would be a worn one.
[58:12.690 --> 58:12.890]  Like a worn one.
[58:13.010 --> 58:13.970]  Yeah, like a Nike shoe.
[58:14.050 --> 58:14.850]  I'm surprised it's just a...
[58:14.850 --> 58:15.810]  Maybe in the new year.
[58:15.810 --> 58:16.210]  Same company.
[58:16.590 --> 58:18.170]  Maybe 2024 will be our year.
[58:18.750 --> 58:19.890]  Maybe 2024 will be our year.
[58:20.310 --> 58:21.070]  I'm going to open up...
[58:21.070 --> 58:23.550]  I'm just going to open up packs of Allen and Gitzer until it's over.
[58:23.670 --> 58:24.350]  Until they leave.
[58:24.650 --> 58:25.470]  Just because I want to.
[58:26.190 --> 58:27.490]  You don't have to stick around, audience.
[58:27.550 --> 58:27.970]  You can go.
[58:28.350 --> 58:29.730]  We'll see you in 2024.
[58:32.050 --> 58:32.770]  Can't wait...
[58:32.770 --> 58:34.430]  to open up more stuff with you.
[58:34.550 --> 58:35.270]  There's Erin Nola.
[58:35.530 --> 58:37.250]  There's Ethan Small.
[58:38.530 --> 58:39.250]  There's the...
[58:39.250 --> 58:40.190]  You have a desk.
[58:40.270 --> 58:40.850]  Oh, we got a...
[58:40.850 --> 58:43.110]  If you had ten desks stacked at the...
[58:43.110 --> 58:43.570]  We got a...
[58:43.570 --> 58:44.370]  They're both...
[58:44.370 --> 58:46.310]  They're all rising at the same time.
[58:46.670 --> 58:51.150]  Is the one on top going way faster than the other ones?
[58:51.170 --> 58:53.250]  Or are they all going at the same speed?
[58:53.430 --> 58:54.630]  Guys, we got an Allen Ridge.
[58:55.030 --> 58:55.450]  Oh, shit.
[58:55.490 --> 58:56.150]  Allen from Allen.
[58:56.330 --> 58:56.730]  God.
[58:56.970 --> 58:57.770]  I love that.
[58:57.830 --> 58:59.330]  That's my favorite thing you've ever told.
[59:02.050 --> 59:03.790]  I think the answer is...
[59:03.790 --> 59:04.890]  Well, we know the answer.
[59:04.970 --> 59:05.550]  Gavin and I are right.
[59:05.610 --> 59:06.790]  No, you're not right.
[59:06.990 --> 59:08.950]  You just made sure that we couldn't get it answered.
[59:09.250 --> 59:09.930]  What?
[59:11.850 --> 59:12.970]  So all right, pod.
[59:13.870 --> 59:16.250]  And also, at Clutch Money Pearls, pod, thank you.
[59:16.630 --> 59:17.810]  Randy Johnson, big unit.
[59:17.890 --> 59:18.890]  They called him that because it was Wiener.
[59:19.350 --> 59:20.330]  Eloy Jimenez.
[59:21.710 --> 59:22.750]  Tyson McGuffin.
[59:23.630 --> 59:24.150]  Marquis...
[59:24.150 --> 59:24.850]  Or, Von Grissom.
[59:25.470 --> 59:26.430]  Riley Green.
[59:26.850 --> 59:27.430]  Pedro Guerrero.
[59:28.730 --> 59:29.710]  Freddie Freeman.
[59:30.130 --> 59:30.990]  Oh, that's a bent arm.
[59:31.510 --> 59:32.470]  That is a bent arm.
[59:32.690 --> 59:35.250]  Well, we'll see you next year.
[59:36.170 --> 59:36.690]  Bye.
[59:36.850 --> 59:37.110]  Bye.
[59:39.250 --> 59:39.850]  Bye.
