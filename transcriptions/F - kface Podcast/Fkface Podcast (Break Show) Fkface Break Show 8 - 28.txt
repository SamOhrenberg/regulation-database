[00:22.000 --> 00:23.720]  The Face Break Show.
[00:24.120 --> 00:26.920]  I believe this is episode four.
[00:27.520 --> 00:28.240]  I don't think it matters.
[00:28.660 --> 00:28.920]  Yeah.
[00:29.160 --> 00:29.300]  Yeah.
[00:29.540 --> 00:32.140]  Well, we, for the people that are counting at home,
[00:32.200 --> 00:34.060]  I think we said we're going to do 150,000 episodes.
[00:34.340 --> 00:37.280]  So we have 149,996.
[00:41.300 --> 00:42.020]  Please don't count at home.
[00:42.480 --> 00:42.640]  Yeah.
[00:44.220 --> 00:45.180]  Welcome to the show.
[00:45.440 --> 00:46.360]  If you're new here,
[00:46.500 --> 00:50.220]  what we do is we celebrate the fun of the unknown.
[00:50.220 --> 00:53.580]  We open up all kinds of cards from stuff like Dallas,
[00:54.760 --> 00:58.400]  college basketball, the James Garner movie, Maverick,
[01:01.520 --> 01:03.560]  bingo, 2017's best cards, baseball.
[01:03.740 --> 01:06.260]  Got some rasslin' for Eric this week.
[01:06.840 --> 01:08.040]  All kinds of fun stuff.
[01:08.780 --> 01:09.760]  Anyway, that's Geoff.
[01:09.840 --> 01:10.300]  That's Emily.
[01:10.420 --> 01:10.980]  I'm Eric.
[01:11.160 --> 01:12.420]  Welcome to the Break Show.
[01:12.820 --> 01:13.880]  We're very excited to be here.
[01:13.920 --> 01:15.100]  Very excited to have you.
[01:15.340 --> 01:16.760]  And we're very excited to open up some cards
[01:16.760 --> 01:18.360]  and maybe we'll get some bangers.
[01:18.360 --> 01:19.880]  Well, last time we opened a...
[01:19.880 --> 01:20.480]  Good.
[01:20.760 --> 01:22.060]  Last time we opened a bunch of cards
[01:22.060 --> 01:24.040]  and you've been doing something
[01:24.040 --> 01:25.040]  where you've been going through
[01:25.040 --> 01:26.540]  and seeing if anything's worth anything.
[01:26.600 --> 01:28.800]  Yeah, so I've been doing, at the start of every episode,
[01:29.080 --> 01:32.040]  I'll go over the hits, and I use the quotation marks,
[01:33.340 --> 01:36.160]  vigorously and angrily, based on last week.
[01:36.220 --> 01:37.460]  We had a conversation about it
[01:37.460 --> 01:39.520]  where you have to show people they're not all hits.
[01:39.800 --> 01:40.220]  They're not all hits.
[01:40.220 --> 01:42.140]  When you collect cards, sometimes you get
[01:42.140 --> 01:45.160]  what you're about to see Geoff go through, and that's okay.
[01:45.160 --> 01:50.020]  Sometimes you win, and almost always, you lose.
[01:50.140 --> 01:52.500]  Sometimes you have a rip card with Cal Ripken Jr. on it.
[01:52.600 --> 01:54.820]  You have a Cal Ripken Jr. card,
[01:55.320 --> 01:56.440]  and you rip it and you ruin it.
[01:56.520 --> 01:57.040]  Okay, here we go.
[01:57.180 --> 01:57.780]  Let's see what there was to learn.
[01:58.160 --> 01:59.820]  We've got some values of some of the cards
[01:59.820 --> 02:02.040]  that we talked about or that seemed like they might be hits.
[02:02.320 --> 02:04.000]  Just to get some context for the new collector.
[02:04.120 --> 02:07.280]  All right, this is a Monopoly Prism Shade on Sharp rookie.
[02:07.440 --> 02:08.540]  He's a pretty popular rookie.
[02:08.640 --> 02:10.640]  This is a base rookie, but because it's Monopoly,
[02:10.760 --> 02:12.060]  it's a Target exclusive.
[02:12.340 --> 02:13.100]  They're hard to come by.
[02:13.140 --> 02:13.980]  It's a little rarer.
[02:13.980 --> 02:16.060]  So if you want to pick up one of these bad boys,
[02:16.100 --> 02:17.140]  it'll cost you a dollar.
[02:19.740 --> 02:22.060]  Here's a Luke Kennard Optic Silver.
[02:22.220 --> 02:23.320]  Now, I'm not throwing this out there
[02:23.320 --> 02:24.920]  because Luke Kennard is hot shit or anything.
[02:25.140 --> 02:27.060]  Although he's in the NBA, and if you're in the NBA,
[02:27.140 --> 02:28.480]  you're a phenomenal basketball player.
[02:28.500 --> 02:28.980]  One of the best.
[02:29.120 --> 02:30.640]  But a silver card is typically worth
[02:30.640 --> 02:31.880]  about 10 times the normal card.
[02:32.340 --> 02:33.880]  And this Luke Kennard Optic Silver,
[02:34.000 --> 02:35.360]  that'll get you about $3.
[02:35.920 --> 02:36.320]  Jesus.
[02:36.840 --> 02:39.620]  Here is a Jaden McDaniels Optic Purple Parallel.
[02:39.660 --> 02:40.220]  This is a rookie.
[02:40.600 --> 02:41.240]  It's parallel.
[02:41.660 --> 02:43.020]  It's a prism.
[02:43.020 --> 02:44.300]  You want this.
[02:44.640 --> 02:47.160]  This is gonna run you, for you Jaden McDaniels fans,
[02:47.240 --> 02:47.700]  about $6.
[02:48.120 --> 02:48.600]  Wow.
[02:48.640 --> 02:49.700]  You want this.
[02:49.900 --> 02:51.180]  CJ Abrams Chrome Rookie.
[02:51.360 --> 02:52.360]  Nothing special about it.
[02:52.380 --> 02:54.780]  It's just the Topps Chrome 2022 is very popular right now,
[02:54.840 --> 02:59.680]  and CJ Abrams was a popular collectible rookie.
[02:59.860 --> 03:00.140]  Yeah.
[03:00.360 --> 03:00.980]  There you go, $2.
[03:01.600 --> 03:02.060]  Nice.
[03:02.320 --> 03:06.540]  Zach Thompson Rookie Blue Chrome Prism Refractor, $2.
[03:07.400 --> 03:10.480]  Bob Gibson Hall of Famer Prism Refractor.
[03:10.480 --> 03:13.580]  Still a huge market for Hall of Famers
[03:13.580 --> 03:14.940]  and old classic baseball players.
[03:15.080 --> 03:15.160]  Yeah.
[03:15.240 --> 03:17.660]  Even when they're released in new sets like this.
[03:18.120 --> 03:20.260]  This bad boy will cost you $2.
[03:21.200 --> 03:25.300]  Here we go, Marcus Passer Die Cut Bowman U Autograph Rookie.
[03:25.620 --> 03:27.180]  It's a sticker auto, not a card.
[03:27.840 --> 03:29.320]  So that's gonna run you $2.
[03:30.020 --> 03:31.280]  What the fuck?
[03:31.520 --> 03:31.860]  This sucks.
[03:32.060 --> 03:33.120]  These are brutal, dude.
[03:33.120 --> 03:34.320]  That was actually Nasir Bolton.
[03:34.440 --> 03:36.600]  That was $3, my apologies.
[03:36.740 --> 03:37.380]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:37.400 --> 03:38.520]  Nasir Bolton, $3.
[03:38.900 --> 03:39.200]  Got it.
[03:39.200 --> 03:43.660]  This is your die cut, Marcus Sasser Bowman U Rookie, $2.
[03:44.800 --> 03:46.080]  Okay, here we go, Kawhi Leonard.
[03:47.540 --> 03:51.040]  The Claw, was the best player in the NBA for about three years
[03:51.040 --> 03:53.240]  until the injuries kind of ruined his career.
[03:54.240 --> 03:55.900]  Green, White, and Purple Parallel.
[03:56.760 --> 03:57.900]  This is Select.
[03:58.300 --> 03:59.740]  This will run you $2.
[04:00.400 --> 04:03.180]  Here we go, John Morant Blue Cracked Ice Prism.
[04:03.720 --> 04:06.720]  Everybody loves John Morant, certainly the gun dealers.
[04:07.320 --> 04:08.740]  And this one will run you...
[04:09.300 --> 04:10.960]  This one will run you $3.
[04:11.780 --> 04:13.560]  And here we go, here's the big boys.
[04:14.420 --> 04:16.340]  So this is what we got when we opened the R.I.P. gift.
[04:16.400 --> 04:18.780]  So we opened up about a $350 R.I.P. card.
[04:18.860 --> 04:20.500]  Somebody messaged me and said
[04:20.500 --> 04:21.520]  that it would never sell for that.
[04:21.600 --> 04:23.160]  That's not true, I based that off a sale.
[04:25.200 --> 04:28.520]  And let's see, so we turned about $350
[04:29.060 --> 04:32.080]  into these two S.P.s, that stands for short print.
[04:32.300 --> 04:34.040]  You can only get them through those hobby cards,
[04:34.620 --> 04:35.480]  or through those hobby boxes.
[04:35.480 --> 04:38.680]  And then this, which is the R.I.P. exclusive,
[04:38.840 --> 04:43.220]  the Stained Glass, which is a quite lovely card.
[04:43.700 --> 04:46.440]  Okay, so these bad boys will do...
[04:46.440 --> 04:49.400]  Oh, and just so you know, a hobby box of this
[04:49.400 --> 04:50.840]  costs you about $125, I want to say.
[04:51.380 --> 04:53.600]  The R.I.P. card that we got in it, the Box Topper,
[04:53.960 --> 04:57.300]  they have one of those about every 24 hobby boxes.
[04:57.620 --> 04:59.640]  So to get another one, you would potentially
[04:59.640 --> 05:00.900]  have to spend about $2,500.
[05:03.380 --> 05:04.660]  Maybe we don't do that.
[05:04.660 --> 05:06.780]  But, if you wanted to pull one naturally.
[05:06.880 --> 05:07.040]  Right.
[05:07.520 --> 05:09.020]  Just to give you an idea of how rare they are.
[05:09.400 --> 05:10.840]  Okay, so the Jackie Robinson?
[05:11.080 --> 05:11.300]  Yeah.
[05:11.700 --> 05:12.280]  That's about $5.
[05:13.440 --> 05:14.540]  The Joey Votto?
[05:14.860 --> 05:15.020]  Yeah.
[05:15.260 --> 05:16.120]  About $15.
[05:16.360 --> 05:16.580]  Okay.
[05:16.940 --> 05:18.820]  And then this bad boy, the Johnny Bitch?
[05:18.940 --> 05:19.160]  Yeah.
[05:21.620 --> 05:24.280]  On a good day, could bring you $75.
[05:24.780 --> 05:25.260]  Dude.
[05:25.500 --> 05:26.300]  Probably $50.
[05:26.440 --> 05:27.520]  That's brutal.
[05:28.220 --> 05:29.280]  Brutal, yes.
[05:29.720 --> 05:31.940]  But hey, you know, sometimes you win,
[05:32.020 --> 05:33.680]  sometimes you lose, mostly you lose.
[05:33.680 --> 05:36.140]  But, this is the card collecting.
[05:36.560 --> 05:37.820]  And the problem with card collecting is,
[05:38.160 --> 05:39.900]  these cards have this assigned value.
[05:40.060 --> 05:42.080]  I looked it up, I do this by sold.
[05:42.320 --> 05:42.500]  Yeah.
[05:42.680 --> 05:44.660]  I was doing PSA 10s for the older stuff,
[05:44.720 --> 05:46.580]  but for this stuff I'm just doing whatever's sold raw.
[05:47.840 --> 05:49.620]  This is the value, but you still have to find
[05:49.620 --> 05:50.220]  somebody to buy it.
[05:50.220 --> 05:50.760]  That sucks.
[05:50.780 --> 05:51.960]  That's the frustrating thing about this.
[05:52.100 --> 05:53.600]  Like, they are definitely worth those prices,
[05:53.740 --> 05:54.780]  but you gotta go out and find somebody.
[05:55.220 --> 05:58.520]  And then, you know, maybe we opened to get these,
[05:59.180 --> 06:00.620]  this $100 worth of cards.
[06:01.000 --> 06:04.240]  We probably opened $600 worth of cards, maybe.
[06:04.420 --> 06:06.260]  But it's the memories we made along the way.
[06:06.480 --> 06:07.240]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[06:07.480 --> 06:08.680]  I hope you'll say that.
[06:08.760 --> 06:09.400]  I mean, for us it's the content.
[06:09.400 --> 06:11.160]  If you look at the checking account this weekend.
[06:11.320 --> 06:12.580]  The content we made along the way.
[06:12.760 --> 06:13.020]  Right.
[06:13.120 --> 06:13.320]  Yeah.
[06:13.540 --> 06:14.660]  But that's enough of last week.
[06:14.680 --> 06:15.880]  Let's go ahead and open up stuff this week.
[06:16.000 --> 06:16.060]  New stuff.
[06:16.060 --> 06:17.400]  As always, we'll start with Pac-Sac.
[06:17.420 --> 06:17.960]  Pac-Sac.
[06:18.380 --> 06:19.020]  He said it right.
[06:19.780 --> 06:20.420]  First card pack.
[06:20.540 --> 06:21.240]  Oh, here we go.
[06:21.300 --> 06:22.180]  Topps Chrome 2022.
[06:24.460 --> 06:28.460]  Oh, and, well, we haven't opened any boxes yet to feed it.
[06:28.520 --> 06:28.940]  We'll feed it.
[06:29.060 --> 06:29.420]  Not yet.
[06:30.280 --> 06:30.960]  Let's see what we got.
[06:31.040 --> 06:32.040]  We're gonna have four cards here.
[06:32.120 --> 06:32.880]  They're all gonna be Topps Chrome.
[06:33.020 --> 06:34.400]  We got, oh, Brandon Marsh, rookie.
[06:34.760 --> 06:35.640]  That's a good card.
[06:36.100 --> 06:38.400]  Then we got Teoscar Hernandez.
[06:40.100 --> 06:41.240]  That's not a good card.
[06:42.080 --> 06:43.540]  And then Reed Detmers.
[06:44.300 --> 06:44.880]  Okay, rookie.
[06:44.880 --> 06:45.940]  We got a lot of angels in this one, huh?
[06:46.080 --> 06:46.700]  Yeah, two of them.
[06:47.120 --> 06:49.420]  And then J.D. Martinez Refractor.
[06:51.260 --> 06:53.020]  I guess that's a, yeah, that's a refractor.
[06:53.120 --> 06:54.820]  Okay, so that's what that was.
[06:56.800 --> 06:58.460]  Do you want me to sleeve any of those?
[06:58.480 --> 06:59.100]  That's what that was.
[06:59.100 --> 06:59.780]  Yeah, these three.
[06:59.940 --> 07:00.800]  Let's see, we'll put them over here.
[07:01.120 --> 07:02.760]  Let's mix things up a little bit.
[07:02.860 --> 07:03.280]  Let's open some.
[07:03.760 --> 07:05.940]  I have a whole box of these Maverick movie cards.
[07:05.980 --> 07:07.760]  I think my friend Jared from Cheap Ass Gamer
[07:07.760 --> 07:09.660]  got me these to bring in.
[07:09.720 --> 07:11.480]  These in the next, hopefully the next pack
[07:11.480 --> 07:12.520]  that we're gonna open after these.
[07:13.040 --> 07:14.260]  You ever seen the movie Maverick?
[07:14.460 --> 07:14.780]  Oh, yeah.
[07:15.000 --> 07:16.240]  I saw it when it came out.
[07:16.860 --> 07:17.820]  James, is that Mel Gibson?
[07:17.980 --> 07:18.140]  Yep.
[07:18.400 --> 07:21.260]  Yeah, James Garner and Mel Gibson were card players, right?
[07:21.260 --> 07:21.960]  I believe it was.
[07:22.840 --> 07:23.380]  Here we go.
[07:23.460 --> 07:25.420]  Oh, you remember the stagecoach scene?
[07:25.420 --> 07:27.340]  Yeah, that's the horses.
[07:28.660 --> 07:30.880]  Meanwhile, back in Crystal City,
[07:31.120 --> 07:33.060]  there's Angel persuading somebody.
[07:33.300 --> 07:33.340]  Cool.
[07:33.940 --> 07:38.540]  Here we have James Garner being pretty swarthy there.
[07:38.980 --> 07:41.520]  I don't know about you, I'm a big James Garner fan.
[07:42.300 --> 07:43.700]  I'll have medium on him, I guess.
[07:43.840 --> 07:44.120]  Well.
[07:44.280 --> 07:45.700]  If I was going to...
[07:45.700 --> 07:48.100]  You clearly haven't seen Tank.
[07:48.540 --> 07:48.880]  Okay.
[07:48.920 --> 07:49.540]  With Sally Field.
[07:49.880 --> 07:53.320]  Or, you know, the greatest television show of all time,
[07:54.060 --> 07:54.740]  Rocket Files.
[07:55.300 --> 07:55.800]  Here we go.
[07:55.800 --> 07:57.120]  James Garner kissing a lady.
[07:59.160 --> 08:00.740]  That's the moment they fell in love.
[08:00.900 --> 08:01.320]  Hooray!
[08:02.140 --> 08:04.580]  Here we have just hanging out by a wagon wheel.
[08:04.720 --> 08:05.000]  Okay.
[08:05.380 --> 08:06.380]  As cowboys do.
[08:06.920 --> 08:08.700]  That's a good sitting spot, wagon wheel.
[08:09.180 --> 08:10.380]  They look like they're tied up.
[08:10.840 --> 08:11.420]  Right, hanging out.
[08:11.660 --> 08:16.060]  Here we have Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, and James Garner,
[08:16.220 --> 08:18.020]  and some kid who's not as famous as them.
[08:18.640 --> 08:21.860]  And this is all before Mel Gibson had a meltdown.
[08:22.100 --> 08:22.240]  Yeah.
[08:22.760 --> 08:23.560]  Public meltdown.
[08:23.660 --> 08:25.180]  All right, here we go, Jodie Foster again,
[08:25.180 --> 08:27.740]  and James Garner.
[08:28.540 --> 08:32.000]  Oh, here's that crazy scene before Angel...
[08:32.000 --> 08:33.520]  Can Angel clobber Maverick?
[08:34.580 --> 08:35.520]  Kicking him in the chest.
[08:35.760 --> 08:36.280]  Oh boy.
[08:36.520 --> 08:36.980]  Oh boy.
[08:37.300 --> 08:38.740]  Way to go Angel, clobber Maverick.
[08:38.880 --> 08:40.140]  No huge hits there, but that's okay.
[08:40.280 --> 08:41.180]  So did you like that movie?
[08:41.640 --> 08:42.260]  I never saw it.
[08:42.520 --> 08:43.180]  I don't really remember it.
[08:43.200 --> 08:44.700]  I remember it being fine.
[08:44.940 --> 08:45.980]  Yeah, I remember it being okay.
[08:46.240 --> 08:47.180]  I think it was funny.
[08:47.520 --> 08:48.260]  I remember it being kind of funny.
[08:48.280 --> 08:49.380]  I remember there being funny parts.
[08:49.520 --> 08:49.880]  Shenanigans.
[08:50.160 --> 08:51.980]  Do the other one, do the next, do the...
[08:51.980 --> 08:52.380]  Yeah!
[08:53.460 --> 08:55.380]  Eric's excited because we're gonna open up...
[08:55.380 --> 08:55.900]  Bingo!
[08:56.420 --> 08:56.780]  Bingo!
[08:56.960 --> 08:57.860]  Oh boy.
[08:58.100 --> 09:01.400]  I got an email today, an unironic email today,
[09:01.520 --> 09:03.680]  to the Eric at Geoff's Boss email account.
[09:03.860 --> 09:05.320]  I actually got a bunch.
[09:06.160 --> 09:08.680]  I had over a hundred, but the one I got today,
[09:08.800 --> 09:09.280]  one of the ones I was,
[09:09.620 --> 09:10.920]  I tried my best to answer all of them.
[09:11.140 --> 09:12.180]  And I had one who said,
[09:12.240 --> 09:13.660]  hey man, I know you love,
[09:13.660 --> 09:15.380]  I love Fuckface, I know you love baseball.
[09:15.900 --> 09:16.880]  You and Eric are really into it.
[09:17.420 --> 09:18.400]  Here's a little hint for you.
[09:18.520 --> 09:21.580]  Go ahead and watch the 2003 ALCS series.
[09:21.580 --> 09:23.940]  Trust me, you're gonna love it.
[09:23.940 --> 09:24.700]  What does that mean?
[09:25.120 --> 09:28.040]  It's where Pedro Martinez and Don Zimmer get into a fight,
[09:28.120 --> 09:31.420]  which I have tattooed on my body from an episode,
[09:31.820 --> 09:32.380]  in an episode.
[09:32.640 --> 09:34.160]  We've made multiple pieces of merch.
[09:34.260 --> 09:36.380]  I was just, I don't know how you get that far down the...
[09:36.380 --> 09:37.300]  Hey man, check this out.
[09:38.120 --> 09:38.940]  I got you.
[09:39.140 --> 09:39.940]  You're gonna love it.
[09:40.300 --> 09:41.320]  I was just like, thanks.
[09:41.800 --> 09:42.260]  You don't.
[09:43.080 --> 09:43.600]  All right.
[09:43.720 --> 09:45.100]  Thanks for listening to some of it.
[09:45.400 --> 09:46.200]  Caged critters.
[09:47.940 --> 09:48.920]  Either of those are bingo.
[09:49.080 --> 09:50.380]  What's the chase card for this again?
[09:50.880 --> 09:51.680]  Bingo can't do it.
[09:51.760 --> 09:51.900]  Okay.
[09:52.000 --> 09:52.640]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[09:53.120 --> 09:54.240]  Bingo, this is a good one though.
[09:54.320 --> 09:54.980]  Bingo at the wheel.
[09:55.660 --> 09:55.980]  Yeah!
[09:56.000 --> 09:56.460]  Look at this guy.
[09:56.580 --> 09:57.160]  He's like...
[09:57.160 --> 09:59.100]  That's where I would get tattooed on me.
[09:59.220 --> 10:00.460]  It would be bingo at the wheel.
[10:01.080 --> 10:02.140]  Bingo at the wheel is cool.
[10:02.440 --> 10:03.260]  Potential Eric tattoos.
[10:03.840 --> 10:04.160]  Ooh!
[10:04.340 --> 10:04.880]  Oh, that's a good one.
[10:04.880 --> 10:05.600]  I like that idea.
[10:06.640 --> 10:07.680]  Band on the run.
[10:07.840 --> 10:08.240]  There you go.
[10:08.260 --> 10:09.380]  Look at all the no's.
[10:09.760 --> 10:10.680]  That's Paul McCartney right there.
[10:11.100 --> 10:11.860]  Oh my God.
[10:12.080 --> 10:12.660]  That's Wings behind him.
[10:12.920 --> 10:14.280]  Yeah, that was the original album cover.
[10:16.960 --> 10:18.260]  Oh no, I didn't grab it, I'm sorry.
[10:19.480 --> 10:19.840]  Is it?
[10:21.280 --> 10:22.160]  It's a good one though.
[10:23.320 --> 10:24.280]  Direct dial barking.
[10:25.580 --> 10:25.860]  Whoa!
[10:26.360 --> 10:27.360]  How'd he do that?
[10:27.640 --> 10:28.620]  Bingo uses pay phones.
[10:29.440 --> 10:29.720]  Wow.
[10:30.100 --> 10:30.880]  That's pretty impressive.
[10:31.120 --> 10:32.360]  You know I don't have a...
[10:32.360 --> 10:33.160]  Oh shit, dude.
[10:33.180 --> 10:33.980]  I don't have a phone on here.
[10:34.100 --> 10:34.600]  We're getting close.
[10:35.580 --> 10:36.140]  Primetime Bingo.
[10:36.960 --> 10:37.800]  I like the guy with a gun.
[10:38.000 --> 10:39.220]  Okay, that's a big gun.
[10:39.280 --> 10:40.540]  I heard they photoshopped that out.
[10:40.600 --> 10:41.720]  So they're all...
[10:42.460 --> 10:43.760]  They're all in their middle 90s.
[10:43.860 --> 10:45.160]  Yeah, it's like kind of like a cult thing.
[10:45.200 --> 10:47.060]  Yeah, the cop woke him up, he's swatting them.
[10:47.200 --> 10:47.320]  Yeah.
[10:47.800 --> 10:48.440]  And Bingo's like, hey.
[10:48.440 --> 10:50.940]  Bingo was up playing Call of Duty all night.
[10:51.120 --> 10:51.160]  Yeah.
[10:53.140 --> 10:54.080]  Dude, that's crazy.
[10:54.200 --> 10:54.600]  Back to back.
[10:54.960 --> 10:55.960]  Surrounded by fire.
[10:56.480 --> 10:56.840]  Whoa.
[10:57.120 --> 10:59.140]  And then, break the fire alarm.
[10:59.220 --> 10:59.580]  Yay!
[11:00.840 --> 11:02.760]  But then, it's a tight situation.
[11:03.660 --> 11:04.900]  I don't even know what I'm looking at.
[11:04.920 --> 11:05.480]  I don't either.
[11:05.720 --> 11:06.800]  Oh, that kid's all tied up.
[11:06.820 --> 11:07.640]  Yeah, there's no Bingo though.
[11:07.860 --> 11:09.660]  And then, the search begins.
[11:10.200 --> 11:10.220]  Oh.
[11:10.920 --> 11:11.280]  Okay.
[11:11.400 --> 11:13.080]  You can tell he's looking because his tail is down.
[11:13.260 --> 11:13.380]  Yeah.
[11:15.600 --> 11:16.080]  Dog packs.
[11:16.100 --> 11:16.760]  Aw, Bingo.
[11:16.760 --> 11:18.240]  Have you guys watched Bingo?
[11:18.580 --> 11:18.720]  No.
[11:18.840 --> 11:19.040]  No.
[11:19.260 --> 11:20.280]  That could be a good...
[11:20.280 --> 11:20.880]  I don't know if...
[11:20.880 --> 11:23.220]  I don't know that I want to watch Bingo on the show.
[11:23.300 --> 11:24.400]  It's better to just know about it.
[11:24.400 --> 11:25.800]  I love learning...
[11:25.800 --> 11:27.400]  Like, I've seen Bingo as a child,
[11:27.720 --> 11:29.660]  but I like learning about Bingo through Bingo cards.
[11:29.720 --> 11:30.100]  I do too.
[11:30.260 --> 11:31.200]  There's something fun about...
[11:31.200 --> 11:32.080]  Because then, I'm gonna be like,
[11:32.140 --> 11:33.360]  oh yeah, this movie wasn't very good.
[11:33.400 --> 11:34.160]  Here's some sad cards.
[11:34.340 --> 11:34.600]  Yeah.
[11:34.900 --> 11:35.820]  Let's learn about Dallas.
[11:35.900 --> 11:36.240]  Yay!
[11:37.500 --> 11:38.640]  I was talking to...
[11:38.640 --> 11:39.300]  70 color cards.
[11:39.320 --> 11:41.120]  I was telling a client about Dallas,
[11:41.280 --> 11:42.620]  like, scene by scene, of course.
[11:42.700 --> 11:43.200]  Of course.
[11:43.360 --> 11:44.660]  And someone else at the salon,
[11:44.820 --> 11:46.160]  and after my client left, whatever,
[11:46.560 --> 11:47.560]  another client was like,
[11:47.940 --> 11:49.360]  who are that girl's friends?
[11:49.560 --> 11:51.360]  Like, she thought I was talking about my friends.
[11:51.780 --> 11:53.340]  And I was like, well, okay,
[11:53.440 --> 11:54.640]  so then there's Bobby and Sue Ellen.
[11:54.840 --> 11:55.660]  And she was like,
[11:55.720 --> 11:56.400]  I thought you just had, like,
[11:56.400 --> 11:58.400]  the craziest friends that were, like, dueling.
[11:58.800 --> 12:00.020]  They, like, stole a baby,
[12:00.420 --> 12:01.680]  and, like, killed a sister.
[12:02.080 --> 12:03.380]  They're kind of like our friends.
[12:03.560 --> 12:04.480]  They are my friends.
[12:05.380 --> 12:07.780]  Here we have Bobby and Pamela.
[12:07.880 --> 12:11.260]  That's at the rodeo where Sue Ellen meets Dusty,
[12:11.400 --> 12:12.400]  who she loves.
[12:12.520 --> 12:12.880]  Fantastic.
[12:12.940 --> 12:14.040]  She and Dusty fall in love.
[12:14.100 --> 12:14.220]  Hooray!
[12:14.220 --> 12:15.240]  And they have a torrid affair.
[12:15.240 --> 12:16.540]  And then Dusty gets in a,
[12:16.800 --> 12:18.380]  she's like, Sue Ellen's gonna leave JR,
[12:18.620 --> 12:20.060]  and then Dusty gets in a plane crash.
[12:20.420 --> 12:21.480]  And so it's like, no!
[12:21.800 --> 12:25.080]  And then later, he ends up not being dead.
[12:25.200 --> 12:26.240]  He was just in a wheelchair,
[12:26.440 --> 12:27.040]  and he was too embarrassed,
[12:27.120 --> 12:27.880]  but he kept an eye on her,
[12:27.920 --> 12:29.180]  and he loved her so much,
[12:29.320 --> 12:30.420]  and they end up being together.
[12:30.600 --> 12:32.120]  But then he didn't want to be with her anymore
[12:32.120 --> 12:33.600]  because his dick didn't work anymore.
[12:33.840 --> 12:34.780]  And so then he was like,
[12:34.800 --> 12:35.580]  I can't be with you!
[12:35.900 --> 12:36.820]  And she was like,
[12:36.860 --> 12:37.620]  you can still be with me.
[12:37.620 --> 12:38.100]  She's like, I love you!
[12:38.120 --> 12:39.300]  We can still do hand and mouth stuff.
[12:39.420 --> 12:39.760]  Oh, cool.
[12:39.900 --> 12:40.760]  And he was like,
[12:40.800 --> 12:41.900]  I don't feel like a real man,
[12:41.940 --> 12:42.800]  and he dumped her anyway.
[12:43.220 --> 12:44.820]  But then he became a rodeo guy again.
[12:44.880 --> 12:46.440]  But now she's kind of hanging out with his dad,
[12:46.480 --> 12:46.980]  which is weird.
[12:47.040 --> 12:47.900]  Yeah, but I think it's like a,
[12:47.980 --> 12:49.580]  it's just someone that loves and cares.
[12:49.680 --> 12:50.980]  I know, it's a little questionable.
[12:51.220 --> 12:51.340]  We'll see.
[12:51.420 --> 12:52.460]  We'll see what happens.
[12:52.480 --> 12:53.380]  Tracy, did you get all that?
[12:54.280 --> 12:54.540]  Cool.
[12:55.680 --> 12:56.600]  There's Jock and Ellie.
[12:56.680 --> 12:58.180]  That's when they go to visit,
[12:58.740 --> 13:01.760]  that's when they go to visit Jock's first wife,
[13:01.820 --> 13:03.260]  which Ellie didn't know about.
[13:03.400 --> 13:05.200]  And she's in an insane asylum
[13:05.200 --> 13:06.400]  because she's got Alzheimer's.
[13:06.440 --> 13:07.180]  And so she's like,
[13:07.240 --> 13:08.480]  oh my God, you're this person.
[13:09.220 --> 13:10.680]  And it was a whole thing.
[13:10.760 --> 13:11.640]  And then Ellie's pissed
[13:11.640 --> 13:13.580]  because Jock wanted to leave some of her money
[13:13.580 --> 13:14.620]  to this other woman.
[13:15.860 --> 13:17.600]  And so, yeah, that was them outside of the,
[13:17.600 --> 13:19.360]  the like house that they put her in,
[13:19.400 --> 13:21.500]  or like the sanitarium.
[13:21.860 --> 13:22.360]  Here we go.
[13:22.600 --> 13:23.580]  Part number three.
[13:23.820 --> 13:24.460]  Classic scene.
[13:24.840 --> 13:25.240]  Oh, yeah.
[13:25.620 --> 13:26.020]  Breakfast.
[13:26.280 --> 13:28.220]  They always have breakfast outside by the pool.
[13:28.440 --> 13:28.640]  Yeah.
[13:29.300 --> 13:29.700]  And...
[13:29.700 --> 13:31.440]  JR's got an attitude, of course.
[13:31.560 --> 13:33.120]  And Bobby's like, well, I'm gonna go.
[13:33.180 --> 13:34.040]  And he's like, all right, now.
[13:34.240 --> 13:36.300]  I have no idea what scene this is from,
[13:36.380 --> 13:38.060]  but I guarantee you at one point,
[13:38.080 --> 13:40.280]  Bobby said, JR, I'm gonna knock your block off.
[13:40.340 --> 13:40.940]  That is, yeah.
[13:40.940 --> 13:42.520]  He always like has a little thing, and then...
[13:42.520 --> 13:43.260]  He's always about to hit him.
[13:43.520 --> 13:44.800]  And then like JR says something worse,
[13:44.880 --> 13:47.080]  and the mom goes, Bobby, leave him alone.
[13:48.360 --> 13:51.000]  They were from Dallas, but it was in the 70s and 80s.
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.700]  So they had that bullshit transcontinental accent
[13:54.220 --> 13:55.880]  that doesn't belong anywhere.
[13:55.960 --> 13:56.380]  It's not real, yeah.
[13:56.540 --> 13:57.360]  Oh, here we go.
[13:57.660 --> 13:58.540]  Oh, that's Lissy.
[13:59.280 --> 13:59.960]  She's great.
[14:00.200 --> 14:02.020]  She has the most beautiful blonde hair.
[14:02.160 --> 14:02.940]  She's the younger one.
[14:03.020 --> 14:05.040]  She's the like, she's their granddaughter.
[14:05.340 --> 14:07.160]  And they act as if they don't have any grandchildren
[14:07.160 --> 14:08.220]  because they don't have a boy.
[14:08.540 --> 14:10.280]  And so they're just like,
[14:10.280 --> 14:12.040]  oh, finally an heir to our thing.
[14:12.060 --> 14:14.080]  And she's like, I've been here, but like, all right.
[14:14.160 --> 14:15.620]  But I'm a girl, nobody cares, you know.
[14:16.180 --> 14:17.240]  If you want to learn more about Dallas,
[14:17.360 --> 14:18.740]  you should go subscribe to Geoff's podcast,
[14:18.840 --> 14:20.520]  So All Right, where he will get into it,
[14:20.640 --> 14:21.800]  whether you want him to or not.
[14:21.860 --> 14:22.640]  It will be an episode.
[14:22.720 --> 14:23.520]  It's one episode.
[14:23.760 --> 14:24.920]  There's Ellie and Jack.
[14:25.140 --> 14:26.260]  I think, I don't know,
[14:26.420 --> 14:28.140]  this could, they had many heartfelt moments.
[14:28.300 --> 14:30.400]  Jack eventually dies in a helicopter crash.
[14:30.680 --> 14:31.080]  We think.
[14:31.500 --> 14:32.260]  They never find his body.
[14:32.260 --> 14:33.900]  Well, the actor's dead, so we think the character's dead.
[14:35.000 --> 14:35.760]  This is JR.
[14:35.860 --> 14:36.380]  That's JR.
[14:36.560 --> 14:37.880]  That's probably the end of an episode.
[14:38.020 --> 14:39.160]  It always zooms in on his face.
[14:39.160 --> 14:41.580]  He looks like a caricature of himself.
[14:41.840 --> 14:42.000]  Yeah.
[14:42.220 --> 14:43.960]  He looks like a drawing.
[14:44.540 --> 14:45.540]  I gotta say.
[14:45.720 --> 14:46.540]  He's so good.
[14:46.720 --> 14:47.980]  I'm in, we're in season five,
[14:48.060 --> 14:49.060]  we're almost through season five,
[14:49.140 --> 14:50.940]  and I've gone through not liking JR
[14:51.510 --> 14:53.440]  to absolutely hating JR,
[14:53.540 --> 14:56.100]  to wishing I could have been the one to pull the trigger,
[14:56.560 --> 14:57.500]  to liking him.
[14:57.940 --> 14:58.360]  Yeah.
[14:58.640 --> 15:00.080]  I'm pro-JR these days.
[15:00.260 --> 15:01.280]  I don't know why, but I am.
[15:01.620 --> 15:02.860]  That's in the room, though,
[15:02.900 --> 15:04.220]  where they have cocktails all the time.
[15:04.320 --> 15:04.800]  There's Bobby.
[15:04.920 --> 15:05.480]  There he is.
[15:05.680 --> 15:06.920]  That's a stain from somebody
[15:06.920 --> 15:08.420]  who liked the body card a little too much.
[15:08.660 --> 15:08.800]  Ew.
[15:09.180 --> 15:10.300]  Yeah, I think so, too.
[15:10.540 --> 15:12.000]  Before he got Suzanne Somers.
[15:13.140 --> 15:14.440]  All right, let's go to some...
[15:14.440 --> 15:15.520]  Thanks for my dad's time.
[15:15.720 --> 15:16.200]  Yeah, absolutely.
[15:16.200 --> 15:17.280]  I love to talk about my greatest passion.
[15:17.280 --> 15:18.440]  There's three more packs, buddy, don't worry.
[15:18.740 --> 15:20.780]  Here we have some Revolution NBA.
[15:21.040 --> 15:24.500]  It looks like I paid $26 for this pack of five cards.
[15:24.980 --> 15:25.200]  Probably, yeah.
[15:26.240 --> 15:26.600]  Probably.
[15:27.540 --> 15:28.040]  We'll see.
[15:29.340 --> 15:29.700]  Revolution?
[15:30.300 --> 15:30.780]  Yeah, Revolution.
[15:30.780 --> 15:31.260]  What are you looking for?
[15:31.340 --> 15:31.580]  Microsmart?
[15:31.760 --> 15:32.380]  Fuck if I know.
[15:32.720 --> 15:33.820]  I don't even remember buying it.
[15:34.420 --> 15:35.120]  Always Microsmart.
[15:35.120 --> 15:36.020]  Wait, I paid how much?
[15:36.820 --> 15:38.340]  Here we go, Joel Embiid base.
[15:38.480 --> 15:38.740]  Cool.
[15:39.120 --> 15:40.440]  He's stressing the process, baby.
[15:40.500 --> 15:41.280]  Cool shirt he's wearing.
[15:41.380 --> 15:44.320]  Imagine if he had any shooters around him
[15:44.320 --> 15:45.320]  that committed to the team.
[15:46.400 --> 15:47.120]  DeMontis Sabonis.
[15:47.560 --> 15:48.120]  There you go.
[15:48.140 --> 15:48.700]  He looks lost.
[15:49.280 --> 15:51.300]  He's really good, and his dad was really good.
[15:52.100 --> 15:53.620]  Here we have Darius Garland,
[15:53.660 --> 15:54.860]  who's becoming the odd man out,
[15:54.980 --> 15:56.120]  and it seems like in the Cavs,
[15:56.140 --> 15:57.800]  which is a real shame because he's phenomenal.
[15:58.520 --> 16:00.200]  Then we have a, ooh,
[16:00.640 --> 16:03.600]  here's a Devin Booker shockwave parallel.
[16:03.960 --> 16:04.600]  That's a cool card.
[16:04.600 --> 16:05.540]  Or insert, rather.
[16:05.640 --> 16:05.960]  I like that.
[16:06.000 --> 16:07.420]  I don't think it's a, yeah, it's just an insert.
[16:07.920 --> 16:09.040]  And then...
[16:09.040 --> 16:10.800]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[16:11.040 --> 16:11.980]  Jason Taylor.
[16:13.300 --> 16:13.660]  Nice.
[16:13.860 --> 16:15.020]  Star parallel, I think.
[16:15.380 --> 16:17.060]  It's called Astro Parallel.
[16:17.200 --> 16:17.480]  Ooh.
[16:17.540 --> 16:18.800]  That's actually a nice little card.
[16:19.300 --> 16:20.960]  Do you want me to make it big sleeve or little sleeve?
[16:21.200 --> 16:21.740]  Big sleeve.
[16:22.140 --> 16:23.240]  Little sleeve, then big sleeve.
[16:23.980 --> 16:25.700]  And then that'll go to Geoff's personal collection
[16:25.700 --> 16:27.140]  because all the Celtics make their way home.
[16:27.160 --> 16:27.660]  Of course.
[16:28.580 --> 16:29.740]  Celtics come home to daddy.
[16:30.000 --> 16:31.740]  You ready for the NBA season or what?
[16:31.980 --> 16:33.020]  I'm ready for the NBA season.
[16:33.240 --> 16:33.760]  When does it start?
[16:33.760 --> 16:34.320]  Or what?
[16:34.780 --> 16:36.020]  It starts in mid-October.
[16:36.200 --> 16:36.360]  Yep.
[16:36.660 --> 16:37.460]  So we're getting close.
[16:37.580 --> 16:37.820]  That's soon.
[16:38.140 --> 16:41.200]  What I'm currently super excited for is WNBA.
[16:41.580 --> 16:43.820]  I watched a whole bunch of WNBA games this weekend.
[16:44.200 --> 16:46.220]  I've decided I'm either an Aces or Liberty fan.
[16:46.320 --> 16:48.000]  I know they're number one and number two team,
[16:48.080 --> 16:49.100]  but they're so much fun to watch.
[16:49.600 --> 16:51.740]  And so the playoffs will be starting before too long.
[16:51.860 --> 16:52.020]  Nice.
[16:52.020 --> 16:54.560]  So before we get to NBA, I'm focused on WNBA.
[16:54.640 --> 16:54.940]  Very cool.
[16:54.960 --> 16:57.540]  This is the year that I get into WNBA with a passion.
[16:57.840 --> 16:58.460]  I'm really excited about it.
[16:58.560 --> 16:59.360]  During the finales.
[16:59.880 --> 17:01.800]  Exactly, that's how you become a fan.
[17:01.800 --> 17:04.880]  All right, here's a pack of 1993 Tops Baseball Series 2.
[17:05.020 --> 17:05.840]  Okay, anything good?
[17:05.840 --> 17:07.200]  Looks like I paid $3 for it.
[17:07.300 --> 17:08.040]  Anything good in these?
[17:08.520 --> 17:09.720]  Who was a rookie in 93?
[17:10.440 --> 17:11.000]  Oh, Jesus.
[17:11.000 --> 17:11.820]  Alex Rodriguez maybe?
[17:11.820 --> 17:12.340]  Yeah, I was gonna say,
[17:12.540 --> 17:13.900]  is that what we're looking for?
[17:13.940 --> 17:14.700]  We're just looking for rookies here?
[17:14.740 --> 17:15.380]  Yeah, probably.
[17:15.500 --> 17:15.720]  All right.
[17:16.340 --> 17:17.060]  We're also looking for food and zoos.
[17:17.060 --> 17:19.420]  I don't know that I've ever opened 93 Tops before.
[17:19.420 --> 17:20.280]  Oh, right, food and zoos.
[17:20.500 --> 17:22.120]  Oh, yeah, we're going for the Ultimate Collections.
[17:22.160 --> 17:22.600]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17:22.800 --> 17:24.300]  Yeah, I've never opened a pack of these cards before.
[17:24.320 --> 17:24.480]  Okay.
[17:24.960 --> 17:26.060]  Here's an Alan Trammell.
[17:26.320 --> 17:26.960]  All right.
[17:28.600 --> 17:29.320]  David Cohn.
[17:29.480 --> 17:29.780]  Okay.
[17:32.100 --> 17:35.280]  I don't know what this is, but here's Ken Caminiti.
[17:35.800 --> 17:37.200]  Hey, it's Cammy, all right.
[17:37.580 --> 17:38.580]  He's like, take me, Jesus.
[17:38.660 --> 17:39.900]  I'm ready, Lord, take me.
[17:39.960 --> 17:40.360]  Jesus, take the wheel.
[17:40.560 --> 17:41.000]  He looks a lot.
[17:41.100 --> 17:42.040]  He's like, where's the ball?
[17:42.160 --> 17:43.100]  Maybe it's I'm saved.
[17:43.240 --> 17:44.000]  Has anybody seen the baseball?
[17:44.520 --> 17:45.640]  Or saved, that's not bad.
[17:46.080 --> 17:47.200]  Charlie Lee Brandt.
[17:47.400 --> 17:47.580]  Okay.
[17:47.720 --> 17:50.520]  Here we have Steve Frey.
[17:51.060 --> 17:51.420]  Wow.
[17:52.180 --> 17:52.900]  Ben Rivera.
[17:53.360 --> 17:55.380]  Ooh, oh, that's a high kick.
[17:57.800 --> 17:58.520]  Tom Bernanski.
[17:58.700 --> 17:59.760]  I'm not sure what to say about that.
[18:00.220 --> 18:00.840]  That one.
[18:01.120 --> 18:02.520]  It looks like he's got,
[18:02.640 --> 18:03.800]  he looks like he's putting his arm around
[18:03.800 --> 18:04.840]  his much taller friend.
[18:05.200 --> 18:07.780]  It looks like he's just like hanging from a vine or something.
[18:08.180 --> 18:10.820]  It looks like he's friends with Invisible Andre the Giant,
[18:10.920 --> 18:11.940]  and they're taking a photo together.
[18:13.000 --> 18:13.400]  It's funny.
[18:13.400 --> 18:14.140]  I'd just leave that for something.
[18:16.060 --> 18:16.780]  Bob Zupsik.
[18:17.880 --> 18:18.600]  Ooh, that's...
[18:18.600 --> 18:20.360]  I don't know what to say about that.
[18:20.460 --> 18:20.960]  Heck of a name.
[18:22.720 --> 18:26.280]  Tracy Woodson, who low-key, up close,
[18:26.760 --> 18:27.400]  I don't know how...
[18:27.400 --> 18:28.100]  I thought it was a mullet.
[18:28.600 --> 18:30.500]  It looks like...
[18:30.500 --> 18:31.440]  You're not gonna be able to see it here,
[18:31.560 --> 18:34.020]  but he looks like he's about 56.
[18:34.360 --> 18:37.820]  He looks like he sewed hair into the back of a hat
[18:37.820 --> 18:39.260]  and then put the hat on.
[18:39.660 --> 18:40.460]  He does.
[18:40.620 --> 18:41.160]  Oh, here we go.
[18:41.720 --> 18:42.520]  Sean Dunstan.
[18:42.900 --> 18:43.700]  Great player.
[18:44.460 --> 18:45.260]  Ryan Thompson.
[18:47.620 --> 18:48.420]  Good strides.
[18:48.960 --> 18:50.540]  Not to say about that.
[18:50.920 --> 18:51.560]  You know what he looks like?
[18:51.780 --> 18:54.160]  He looks like that character that R. Crumb would draw.
[18:54.320 --> 18:55.240]  Like Keep on Truckin' guy.
[18:55.240 --> 18:56.860]  Oh yeah, he's in Keep on Truckin'.
[18:56.860 --> 18:57.660]  Yeah, Keep on Truckin'.
[18:58.500 --> 18:59.880]  Oh, here we go.
[19:00.720 --> 19:02.200]  I can't fuckin' read this.
[19:02.280 --> 19:02.560]  There we go.
[19:02.780 --> 19:05.340]  Matt Whiteside, Gold Foil.
[19:06.620 --> 19:07.500]  Oh, hell yeah.
[19:08.160 --> 19:08.660]  Fuck yeah.
[19:08.800 --> 19:10.780]  Ryan Thompson, Keep on Truckin', Gold Foil.
[19:10.780 --> 19:11.740]  Wait, wait, wait, what?
[19:12.140 --> 19:13.040]  Yeah, look at that.
[19:13.100 --> 19:14.180]  You got the regular and the Gold Foil.
[19:14.240 --> 19:14.640]  Hell yeah.
[19:15.080 --> 19:16.520]  Here we have Barry Bonds, Joe Carter,
[19:16.660 --> 19:18.080]  1992, Tops, All-Stars.
[19:18.180 --> 19:19.580]  What an ugly fuckin' card.
[19:19.720 --> 19:20.480]  That's terrible.
[19:20.720 --> 19:22.080]  That's a 1990...
[19:22.080 --> 19:24.620]  That feels like going to a Regal Cinema.
[19:24.760 --> 19:26.640]  I was gonna say, that's a Tinseltown right there.
[19:26.640 --> 19:28.260]  That is the Tinseltown of baseball cards.
[19:28.360 --> 19:28.740]  That's rough.
[19:28.960 --> 19:29.280]  Let's see that though.
[19:29.700 --> 19:31.040]  Here we go, Top Prospects.
[19:31.640 --> 19:32.120]  Holy shit.
[19:32.520 --> 19:32.940]  Here we go.
[19:33.440 --> 19:36.800]  Mike Piazza, Brooke Fordyce,
[19:37.200 --> 19:39.860]  Carlos Delgado, and Donnie Fishhook.
[19:39.960 --> 19:41.060]  Other than Mike Piazza,
[19:41.200 --> 19:42.540]  the other guys turn out to be anything?
[19:43.640 --> 19:44.580]  Carlos Delgado did.
[19:45.000 --> 19:45.300]  Okay.
[19:45.780 --> 19:47.440]  Mark Thompson, 92 draft pick.
[19:48.640 --> 19:49.080]  That's...
[19:49.080 --> 19:50.980]  It looks like he's like putting the ball on a wall.
[19:51.060 --> 19:52.440]  It's the first year of the Rockies, isn't it?
[19:52.560 --> 19:52.880]  93?
[19:53.220 --> 19:53.620]  Was it?
[19:53.980 --> 19:55.740]  Yeah, the Rockies and the...
[19:55.740 --> 19:57.000]  No, Marlins were 97.
[19:57.480 --> 19:57.760]  Rockies?
[19:59.260 --> 20:00.780]  No, maybe the Rays were later then.
[20:00.840 --> 20:02.100]  What were they before they were the Rockies?
[20:02.180 --> 20:02.900]  No, there was just no team.
[20:02.920 --> 20:03.520]  Oh, there just wasn't.
[20:03.860 --> 20:04.140]  Oh, okay.
[20:06.040 --> 20:06.840]  Sterling Hitchcock.
[20:07.180 --> 20:07.740]  Ooh, spooky.
[20:09.220 --> 20:11.060]  Oh, I think we have a new sup photo.
[20:11.500 --> 20:11.720]  Okay.
[20:12.580 --> 20:13.280]  Darren Holmes.
[20:13.700 --> 20:13.960]  Yeah!
[20:15.080 --> 20:15.340]  Sup?
[20:15.620 --> 20:15.980]  Oh yeah.
[20:16.280 --> 20:17.880]  He's like, yeah, I got my ball right here.
[20:18.020 --> 20:18.540]  Brick wall.
[20:18.720 --> 20:19.500]  That's what's up.
[20:19.780 --> 20:21.320]  Here we go, Kirby Puckett and Larry Walker.
[20:22.080 --> 20:22.460]  Nice.
[20:23.360 --> 20:23.760]  This...
[20:23.760 --> 20:25.340]  Should I be in like double trouble or something?
[20:25.340 --> 20:26.940]  Did you see that Kirby Puckett story?
[20:27.140 --> 20:27.240]  Yeah.
[20:27.540 --> 20:27.780]  That's fun.
[20:27.920 --> 20:28.820]  You want me to catch it for you?
[20:28.820 --> 20:29.560]  You want me to catch that for you?
[20:29.660 --> 20:29.780]  Yeah.
[20:30.260 --> 20:31.440]  It was on Reddit recently?
[20:31.520 --> 20:31.740]  Yeah.
[20:32.580 --> 20:33.340]  You can tell it.
[20:33.400 --> 20:34.820]  Was this Puckett's last season?
[20:35.040 --> 20:36.020]  One of his last seasons?
[20:36.100 --> 20:36.400]  Probably.
[20:36.520 --> 20:39.080]  He had glaucoma and like eye surgeries and stuff?
[20:39.120 --> 20:39.600]  Oh no.
[20:39.840 --> 20:40.680]  Yeah, that was tough.
[20:40.900 --> 20:41.460]  Somebody was...
[20:41.460 --> 20:43.980]  There was a story on Reddit recently where somebody...
[20:44.800 --> 20:46.580]  Somebody was a rookie playing for,
[20:46.640 --> 20:47.860]  I guess the Twins probably.
[20:48.560 --> 20:50.020]  And they got their first paycheck
[20:50.020 --> 20:52.460]  and they were just like in the locker room looking at it
[20:52.460 --> 20:53.600]  and Kirby Puckett walked over and goes,
[20:53.660 --> 20:54.760]  first big league paycheck, huh?
[20:54.760 --> 20:56.360]  And the kid like held up proud and goes,
[20:56.440 --> 20:57.560]  yeah, it is.
[20:57.600 --> 20:59.000]  And he goes, he pulls out a wad of cash
[20:59.000 --> 20:59.980]  and goes, you want me to cash it for you?
[21:00.700 --> 21:01.800]  Oh my God.
[21:01.900 --> 21:02.580]  Yeah, Kirby Puckett rules.
[21:03.080 --> 21:04.380]  I've always heard he's kind of a dick
[21:04.380 --> 21:05.320]  and I think that's awesome.
[21:05.680 --> 21:06.600]  I think I have a new,
[21:06.660 --> 21:08.500]  I think I have a new great baseball name.
[21:08.620 --> 21:08.860]  Okay.
[21:10.180 --> 21:10.820]  Sherard Clinkscales.
[21:11.120 --> 21:12.440]  Oh my God.
[21:12.800 --> 21:13.440]  That's awesome.
[21:13.900 --> 21:17.620]  Also, he's in a blank hat Purdue sweatshirt.
[21:17.760 --> 21:17.960]  Yeah.
[21:18.300 --> 21:18.500]  Wow.
[21:18.600 --> 21:19.160]  He didn't even go to Purdue.
[21:19.580 --> 21:19.840]  Here you go.
[21:20.340 --> 21:21.720]  Should I just have like a cool name file?
[21:21.720 --> 21:22.260]  He's just a fan.
[21:22.440 --> 21:22.560]  Yeah.
[21:22.840 --> 21:23.580]  It's just cool.
[21:23.580 --> 21:24.940]  Derek Wallace.
[21:25.200 --> 21:26.180]  Boy, that's a...
[21:26.180 --> 21:27.100]  Looks like he's a...
[21:27.100 --> 21:28.080]  That's a boy.
[21:28.400 --> 21:29.120]  That looks like he's...
[21:29.120 --> 21:30.100]  That's a boy.
[21:30.240 --> 21:30.960]  Little League photo.
[21:31.000 --> 21:31.780]  Yes, absolutely.
[21:31.980 --> 21:33.220]  Should we have a Little League photo section?
[21:33.380 --> 21:34.140]  Oh my God, yeah.
[21:34.360 --> 21:34.900]  He's a boy.
[21:34.960 --> 21:35.200]  A little slugger.
[21:35.380 --> 21:36.080]  Yeah, a little slugger.
[21:37.380 --> 21:38.180]  Lance Painter.
[21:39.240 --> 21:39.980]  Jack Armstrong.
[21:40.100 --> 21:40.940]  These are fun for me
[21:40.940 --> 21:42.460]  because I've never seen these cards before.
[21:42.560 --> 21:42.720]  Yeah.
[21:42.940 --> 21:44.000]  I mean, I know the design,
[21:44.100 --> 21:45.200]  but I've never opened them before.
[21:45.540 --> 21:46.560]  Yvonne Calderon.
[21:47.540 --> 21:48.340]  Daryl Boston.
[21:49.940 --> 21:50.360]  Name's a place.
[21:50.660 --> 21:51.580]  Yeah, name's a place.
[21:51.860 --> 21:52.580]  Name's a place, thank you.
[21:53.720 --> 21:54.600]  Darren Reed.
[21:55.020 --> 21:56.280]  Oh, Todd Van Poppel.
[21:56.720 --> 21:57.340]  That's a...
[21:58.860 --> 22:01.420]  Why is his neck bigger than his head?
[22:01.640 --> 22:02.340]  That's a good question.
[22:02.720 --> 22:03.940]  That's a good question.
[22:04.040 --> 22:05.640]  The steroids hadn't, like, gotten out of the way.
[22:05.640 --> 22:06.160]  How, what?
[22:06.160 --> 22:07.560]  They hadn't made their way down to the rest of his body.
[22:07.560 --> 22:08.000]  How weird.
[22:08.280 --> 22:09.460]  He's a good baseball name, Todd Van Poppel.
[22:09.880 --> 22:10.660]  Jim Tomey.
[22:10.840 --> 22:12.520]  This might be close to a rookie then.
[22:13.280 --> 22:16.200]  Nah, he had been in and out since 91.
[22:17.440 --> 22:18.320]  Shane Reynolds.
[22:18.920 --> 22:19.360]  Whoa.

[22:28.080 --> 22:29.920]  Geoff Nelson, blue on blue.
[22:30.680 --> 22:32.040]  And Brian Bohannon.
[22:32.180 --> 22:34.640]  Man, I really enjoyed opening up that pack of cards.
[22:34.720 --> 22:34.960]  Good.
[22:35.380 --> 22:36.120]  Never done that before.
[22:37.300 --> 22:38.960]  You wanna get this mail?
[22:39.180 --> 22:40.120]  Yeah, let's do some mail.
[22:40.540 --> 22:41.560]  This is from Tony.
[22:42.520 --> 22:44.620]  He said, you can open this or throw it away or whatever.
[22:45.400 --> 22:47.700]  Stick em up, Garbage Pail Kids poster, tops.
[22:47.920 --> 22:50.060]  I don't remember ever seeing...
[22:50.060 --> 22:52.060]  And I said, what?
[22:52.340 --> 22:53.540]  And he said, I know you hate these,
[22:53.740 --> 22:54.520]  but you know, just do whatever.
[22:54.760 --> 22:57.720]  He gets a box of like 80s and 90s stuff sent to him.
[22:57.920 --> 22:59.120]  And so this was sent to him and he's like...
[22:59.120 --> 23:00.100]  Is it like a loot crate type thing?
[23:00.200 --> 23:02.280]  I think so, but it's like from a guy.
[23:02.900 --> 23:04.520]  Oh, this is from 1986.
[23:04.860 --> 23:05.180]  Yes.
[23:05.600 --> 23:06.980]  And it is the year I was born.
[23:07.240 --> 23:07.600]  Same.
[23:07.820 --> 23:08.260]  Oh my God.
[23:09.980 --> 23:10.720]  What year is that?
[23:10.760 --> 23:12.500]  Is it like a pig or a tiger yearbook?
[23:12.500 --> 23:13.920]  Yeah, it's a big, it's a pig.
[23:14.700 --> 23:15.680]  I was born in May of 86.
[23:16.100 --> 23:17.260]  I'm a fire tiger.
[23:18.140 --> 23:18.820]  Fire tiger.
[23:18.820 --> 23:20.040]  Yeah, fire tiger.
[23:20.160 --> 23:20.960]  What is February?
[23:21.200 --> 23:21.720]  Is that ice cream?
[23:22.260 --> 23:22.580]  Oh!
[23:23.200 --> 23:23.520]  Ooh!
[23:23.660 --> 23:25.700]  Oh, well this is going up on the wall.
[23:25.960 --> 23:26.120]  That's awesome.
[23:26.120 --> 23:27.700]  This permanent fixture.
[23:28.160 --> 23:28.900]  I'll do it like this.
[23:31.480 --> 23:32.620]  Garbage Pail Kids want you.
[23:32.700 --> 23:33.820]  Can we stick that right up?
[23:33.880 --> 23:34.140]  Yeah.
[23:34.180 --> 23:35.020]  And put that up permanently?
[23:35.180 --> 23:36.320]  Oh, I have duct tape right here.
[23:36.800 --> 23:37.460]  There you go.
[23:37.640 --> 23:37.960]  Yay!
[23:38.400 --> 23:39.160]  Thank you, Tony.
[23:39.240 --> 23:39.800]  That was awesome.
[23:39.880 --> 23:41.140]  Here's another piece of mail.
[23:41.200 --> 23:41.640]  I wouldn't show the address.
[23:41.640 --> 23:42.520]  Yeah, I'm not gonna show the address.
[23:42.820 --> 23:43.720]  There is, it's already open.
[23:44.100 --> 23:44.880]  Okay, thank you.
[23:45.100 --> 23:45.260]  Yep.
[23:45.560 --> 23:46.760]  It is from who?
[23:46.880 --> 23:47.100]  David?
[23:47.300 --> 23:48.320]  Yeah, and there's a little note
[23:48.320 --> 23:49.320]  right on that side there.
[23:49.780 --> 23:51.420]  You don't have to read the whole thing, but...
[23:51.420 --> 23:52.200]  David says,
[23:52.320 --> 23:53.720]  Dear Eric, Emily, and Geoff,
[23:53.840 --> 23:54.880]  I hear you like Snoopy and baseball.
[23:55.200 --> 23:56.380]  There's some other stuff, but here you go.
[23:56.840 --> 23:57.940]  Says I don't have to read the whole thing.
[23:58.000 --> 23:58.120]  Yeah.
[23:58.760 --> 23:59.120]  Snoopy?
[23:59.260 --> 23:59.620]  Snoopy!
[24:01.780 --> 24:04.840]  And, ooh, is this the first Peanuts related stuff?
[24:04.840 --> 24:05.840]  I think it might be.
[24:05.980 --> 24:06.560]  It might be.
[24:07.080 --> 24:07.800]  Peanuts collection.
[24:07.840 --> 24:08.060]  Yep.
[24:08.200 --> 24:09.260]  And then this.
[24:09.400 --> 24:09.780]  All right.
[24:10.000 --> 24:11.440]  So a couple of things in here.
[24:11.960 --> 24:13.480]  If you wanna send stuff, you can.
[24:14.060 --> 24:16.800]  1901 East 51st Street, Austin, Texas, 78723.
[24:16.800 --> 24:18.340]  You're gonna be able to, it's a break show.
[24:18.400 --> 24:20.600]  And then you put care of Eric or Geoff or something.
[24:20.800 --> 24:21.760]  It makes our way to us.
[24:21.820 --> 24:22.820]  It's just easier if there's a name.
[24:22.900 --> 24:24.740]  So that way somebody looks at it and they go,
[24:24.860 --> 24:25.760]  who the fuck does this?
[24:25.800 --> 24:27.280]  And it just ends up in our box.
[24:27.500 --> 24:27.760]  There you go.
[24:28.140 --> 24:28.460]  Peanuts!
[24:28.640 --> 24:30.740]  We'll open up this one and then we'll save the other one
[24:30.740 --> 24:31.820]  for another day.
[24:31.980 --> 24:32.560]  All right, here we go.
[24:32.600 --> 24:33.700]  This is 33 trading cards.
[24:33.720 --> 24:34.640]  Where would you like to put it, Emily?
[24:34.920 --> 24:35.640]  I like it.
[24:35.860 --> 24:36.020]  Right there.
[24:36.140 --> 24:36.860]  It should be behind you.
[24:37.280 --> 24:38.740]  I don't want it behind me.
[24:39.640 --> 24:40.600]  Right there's perfect.
[24:40.780 --> 24:41.620]  Okay, I'm checking.
[24:42.200 --> 24:43.700]  Charles Monroe Schultz.
[24:43.700 --> 24:46.800]  Little piece of local trivia for you, for Austin.
[24:47.060 --> 24:48.440]  While she's putting that up.
[24:49.680 --> 24:51.260]  Charles Schultz, the Schultz family,
[24:51.420 --> 24:52.680]  owned a lot of property in Austin,
[24:53.040 --> 24:54.360]  including the old Hooters.
[24:54.480 --> 24:56.400]  The old Snoopy Hooters.
[24:56.420 --> 24:57.680]  Yeah, it was a Snoopy Hooters.
[24:57.700 --> 24:59.660]  Snoopy Hooters.
[24:59.720 --> 25:01.080]  The Schultz's owned that land.
[25:01.140 --> 25:03.020]  And they leased it out to the Hooters people.
[25:03.460 --> 25:04.660]  Speaking of Hooters.
[25:04.760 --> 25:06.660]  Look at Snoopy, he's taking a nap.
[25:07.100 --> 25:07.680]  He's snoozing.
[25:07.760 --> 25:08.520]  There's Lucy.
[25:08.640 --> 25:09.980]  Watch out, that's dangerous.
[25:10.300 --> 25:11.680]  And then there's Charlie.
[25:11.820 --> 25:12.340]  Charlie.
[25:12.760 --> 25:13.500]  Come on, Chuck.
[25:13.560 --> 25:13.920]  Minus.
[25:13.920 --> 25:14.620]  No, that's you.
[25:14.920 --> 25:15.320]  He's got that, yeah.
[25:15.320 --> 25:16.720]  There's Peppermint Patty.
[25:16.800 --> 25:19.420]  Z plus Z equals, oh, it's another Z, she's sleeping.
[25:20.460 --> 25:23.100]  I'm not your sweet baboo, Sally.
[25:23.580 --> 25:25.140]  Oh, that is, that's absolutely.
[25:25.760 --> 25:26.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[25:26.140 --> 25:26.940]  Is Woodstock playing baseball?
[25:27.040 --> 25:28.180]  Whoa, we have to hang on to that.
[25:28.280 --> 25:29.580]  That's Peanuts baseball, that's really cool.
[25:30.200 --> 25:30.980]  Snoopy tennis.
[25:31.760 --> 25:32.560]  Snoopy golf.
[25:33.080 --> 25:33.880]  Snoopy basketball.

[25:36.780 --> 25:38.040]  Snoopy got first place.
[25:38.280 --> 25:39.780]  Wow, congratulations, Snoopy.
[25:39.780 --> 25:41.920]  He's so smug, he's like, I earned this, I know.
[25:41.920 --> 25:43.240]  Snoopy and Marcy.
[25:43.460 --> 25:43.940]  Oh, wow, Snoopy ice cream.
[25:43.940 --> 25:45.400]  There's Franklin eating ice cream.
[25:45.440 --> 25:46.000]  That's cool.
[25:46.100 --> 25:46.920]  Oh, you're gonna love this one.
[25:47.140 --> 25:47.660]  There's Spike.
[25:48.060 --> 25:49.300]  Yeah, Spike is cool.
[25:49.680 --> 25:50.420]  Everyone likes Spike.
[25:50.540 --> 25:51.860]  Forgot to rake my hair.
[25:51.980 --> 25:52.680]  Oh, no.
[25:52.960 --> 25:53.120]  Pig pen.
[25:53.220 --> 25:53.680]  Pig pen.
[25:54.340 --> 25:56.000]  There's Lucy offering psychiatric help.
[25:56.120 --> 25:56.880]  Doctor's in.
[25:57.400 --> 25:59.300]  Oh, here's Vulture, your favorite.
[25:59.600 --> 26:00.700]  We have to hang on to Vulture, Snoopy.
[26:00.960 --> 26:02.020]  That's a potential Eric tattoo.
[26:02.260 --> 26:03.360]  Dark and stormy night.
[26:03.500 --> 26:03.680]  Yeah.
[26:03.940 --> 26:05.120]  We got Easter Beagle.
[26:06.660 --> 26:07.440]  Expecting company.
[26:07.740 --> 26:08.620]  Easter Beagle.
[26:08.800 --> 26:09.500]  Easter Beagle's pretty good.
[26:09.500 --> 26:10.340]  I like Easter Beagle.
[26:10.360 --> 26:11.040]  Expecting company.
[26:12.240 --> 26:14.220]  Here we have Joe Cool.
[26:14.460 --> 26:15.580]  Oh, wow.
[26:15.880 --> 26:16.200]  That's pretty cool.
[26:16.720 --> 26:17.580]  He's pretty cool.
[26:18.240 --> 26:19.560]  Snoopy kisses Lucy.
[26:19.840 --> 26:20.700]  She hates it.
[26:20.860 --> 26:21.320]  Charlie Brown loves it.
[26:21.320 --> 26:22.520]  She goes, ack!
[26:23.320 --> 26:25.940]  Here's the, you're a good man, Charlie Brown card.
[26:27.660 --> 26:29.420]  Happiness is a warm puppy.
[26:29.560 --> 26:30.040]  It's true.
[26:30.440 --> 26:31.020]  That was a gun.
[26:31.060 --> 26:31.720]  Oh, that's old.
[26:32.060 --> 26:35.440]  So the drawing on that is an older version of Snoopy.
[26:36.220 --> 26:38.860]  Like he's looking, it's like later Snoopy looking at
[26:38.860 --> 26:41.280]  like an earlier drawing of Snoopy stuff.
[26:41.380 --> 26:41.880]  That's really cool.
[26:42.080 --> 26:42.500]  That's neat.
[26:42.880 --> 26:43.580]  I did it.
[26:43.800 --> 26:45.540]  I'm the first Beagle on the moon.
[26:45.640 --> 26:47.960]  I have a shirt of him like that.
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.360]  And he says like, I'm on the moon.
[26:49.480 --> 26:50.040]  And it's great.
[26:50.300 --> 26:52.560]  Here's the flying ace getting shot at.
[26:52.960 --> 26:53.660]  Great pumpkin.
[26:55.160 --> 26:56.500]  Boy named Charlie Brown.
[26:56.660 --> 26:58.600]  It's a, I guess the original poster art.
[26:58.960 --> 27:00.960]  And then, oh, here we have classic moment.
[27:01.060 --> 27:02.020]  Thanksgiving special.
[27:04.020 --> 27:05.220]  Then the Christmas special.
[27:05.300 --> 27:05.680]  There you go.
[27:05.760 --> 27:06.320]  Oh, that's fun.
[27:06.680 --> 27:07.320]  Those are awesome.
[27:07.440 --> 27:07.720]  Thank you.
[27:07.720 --> 27:08.820]  We'll open the rest next time.
[27:09.020 --> 27:10.300]  I listened to that record.
[27:10.520 --> 27:12.640]  Christmas time is when I put on that, the Snoopy,
[27:12.800 --> 27:14.500]  like the Peanuts Christmas album.
[27:14.660 --> 27:15.140]  It's great.
[27:15.460 --> 27:15.620]  Yeah.
[27:16.540 --> 27:17.740]  I've not, I haven't listened to that in a long time.
[27:17.740 --> 27:18.240]  That's cute.
[27:18.760 --> 27:19.420]  That was pretty good.
[27:19.900 --> 27:21.440]  We also have Cards Against Humanity.
[27:21.540 --> 27:22.820]  Cards Against Humanity saves baseball.
[27:23.000 --> 27:24.640]  So let's, I don't even know what that is.
[27:24.660 --> 27:25.100]  I don't either.
[27:25.960 --> 27:26.840]  Let's just open one.
[27:26.980 --> 27:27.180]  Okay.
[27:27.400 --> 27:27.900]  Save the others.
[27:30.680 --> 27:31.060]  Oh.
[27:32.120 --> 27:32.520]  Slammers.
[27:33.380 --> 27:33.700]  Okay.
[27:33.980 --> 27:34.260]  Oh, we got.
[27:34.560 --> 27:34.820]  Slam.
[27:34.880 --> 27:35.140]  Boom.
[27:35.140 --> 27:37.980]  Ridge the Hula Hoopy Haslam.
[27:38.180 --> 27:39.600]  Oh, then we're doing like a funny bit.
[27:40.380 --> 27:40.900]  Uh.
[27:40.900 --> 27:42.140]  I didn't know what we were getting.
[27:42.420 --> 27:43.060]  I understand now.
[27:43.320 --> 27:44.480]  His hotness rating is eight.
[27:44.600 --> 27:46.340]  His favorite candlestick is Tropical Breeze.
[27:47.140 --> 27:47.660]  Okay.
[27:48.460 --> 27:49.600]  Here's a Slammer.
[27:50.080 --> 27:51.640]  Nikolai the Uncle Uharic.
[27:51.720 --> 27:52.420]  Yeah, that's funny.
[27:52.480 --> 27:53.620]  Here we have Tyler House.
[27:54.100 --> 27:55.040]  Name is a place.
[27:56.620 --> 27:58.340]  Duke M. Night Shalomon,
[27:58.400 --> 28:01.020]  M. Night Shalomon Von Shaman.
[28:01.740 --> 28:03.260]  Shane Bryant Throws Hard.
[28:03.260 --> 28:05.600]  And Dom Chompers Iero.
[28:06.480 --> 28:06.840]  Cool.
[28:07.040 --> 28:07.160]  Weird.
[28:07.280 --> 28:08.040]  Way to go, Chompers.
[28:08.440 --> 28:09.360]  Good job, Chompers.
[28:09.460 --> 28:10.600]  So it's Kai's Against Humanity?
[28:10.700 --> 28:10.880]  Yeah.
[28:11.180 --> 28:12.080]  What is this?
[28:12.260 --> 28:13.880]  And then Effin' Birds.
[28:14.240 --> 28:14.340]  What?
[28:14.440 --> 28:15.780]  23-3 by Aaron Reynolds.
[28:15.900 --> 28:17.260]  Oh my God, what the fuck?
[28:17.960 --> 28:19.660]  Eight cards to pack, 100 unique cards.
[28:19.880 --> 28:22.780]  Extremely rude, totally fake bird facts on the back.
[28:22.900 --> 28:23.140]  Oh.
[28:24.120 --> 28:24.660]  I was getting excited.
[28:24.800 --> 28:26.040]  You know, Emily and I are birders now.
[28:26.040 --> 28:26.840]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28:26.940 --> 28:27.760]  We have been for a little while.
[28:27.780 --> 28:31.180]  I think I sent Emily some TikToks of like pygmy falcons.
[28:31.480 --> 28:32.220]  Oh yeah, I'm ready.
[28:32.220 --> 28:34.080]  I want you to wear one to the wedding.
[28:34.220 --> 28:35.040]  You can get a little falcon.
[28:35.280 --> 28:37.280]  You're our official falconer for the wedding.
[28:37.340 --> 28:38.180]  You can get a falcon roll.
[28:38.260 --> 28:38.840]  Effin' Birds.
[28:39.020 --> 28:41.460]  Excuse me for not being a total piece of shit.
[28:41.640 --> 28:43.300]  That's what the puffin says.
[28:43.480 --> 28:43.940]  That's true.
[28:44.000 --> 28:44.700]  Classic puffin.
[28:46.520 --> 28:47.580]  Upstanding razor bill,
[28:47.700 --> 28:49.460]  this bird probably shouldn't throw stones
[28:49.460 --> 28:52.180]  considering how often it drunk dials its ex.
[28:52.620 --> 28:53.380]  Classic bird.
[28:53.680 --> 28:54.360]  That puffin.
[28:54.740 --> 28:56.300]  Bitch, do I look like I give a fuck?
[28:56.980 --> 28:57.540]  These are weird.
[28:57.640 --> 28:58.420]  This looks like stuff,
[28:58.640 --> 29:00.140]  Emily, this looks like something you share on Instagram.
[29:00.440 --> 29:00.600]  Me?
[29:00.600 --> 29:02.220]  Sage fuck, let that shit go.
[29:03.280 --> 29:04.320]  Christ on a fucking bicycle.
[29:04.540 --> 29:05.200]  What the fuck is this shit?
[29:05.460 --> 29:07.860]  Man, you can really go too far with swearing.
[29:08.000 --> 29:11.780]  You can really take the funny out of potty real fast.
[29:11.880 --> 29:13.100]  Oh my god, what the heck?
[29:13.700 --> 29:15.740]  Feel free to leave me out of your bullshit.
[29:16.380 --> 29:16.840]  It's all right.
[29:17.140 --> 29:19.480]  All right, motherfuckers, I'm here to get shit-faced.
[29:19.760 --> 29:22.860]  Okay, and then Christ in a fucking gravy boat.
[29:22.980 --> 29:23.940]  What is wrong with you?
[29:24.060 --> 29:24.340]  Okay.
[29:25.040 --> 29:26.540]  I guess they're good whenever you're mad.
[29:26.620 --> 29:28.320]  You can just like pull a card and say it.
[29:28.460 --> 29:28.960]  I guess, yeah.
[29:29.180 --> 29:29.720]  Why not?
[29:31.420 --> 29:33.080]  Here's an interesting thing we have to open.
[29:33.080 --> 29:34.300]  What the fuck is that?
[29:34.440 --> 29:36.240]  So this is just a pack of...
[29:36.240 --> 29:37.380]  Can you turn it like sideways and stuff?
[29:37.620 --> 29:40.460]  2021 NBA Prism, it's a hangar pack.
[29:40.520 --> 29:41.740]  It's beat to fuck.
[29:42.040 --> 29:43.800]  It's, this is how it came to me in the mail.
[29:43.860 --> 29:44.620]  Oh my god.
[29:44.860 --> 29:47.160]  So Emily was saying it looks like Zion's knee.
[29:49.400 --> 29:50.000]  Kind of.
[29:50.220 --> 29:53.420]  So let's open this bad boy up and see how damaged it is.
[29:54.140 --> 29:56.100]  Now what we're looking for here is obviously
[29:56.680 --> 29:57.720]  a Lamello ball.
[29:58.500 --> 29:59.780]  Was it, yeah, Lamello and Zion.
[30:00.240 --> 30:02.800]  Now, were Lamello and Zion the same year?
[30:03.660 --> 30:03.920]  No.
[30:04.700 --> 30:05.460]  Who was with Zion?
[30:05.680 --> 30:06.260]  RJ Barrett.
[30:06.620 --> 30:08.240]  These are Panini?
[30:08.740 --> 30:11.040]  Yeah, these are Prism, Panini, Prism.
[30:11.740 --> 30:16.260]  This is the flagship basketball card, I would say.
[30:17.300 --> 30:18.560]  Matthew Delevadova, Delhi.
[30:18.760 --> 30:19.400]  He's from Australia.
[30:19.940 --> 30:22.120]  He was on the Cavs team that won a title.
[30:22.380 --> 30:22.500]  Cool.
[30:22.880 --> 30:26.380]  Here we have JJ Redick who retired and now runs a podcast.
[30:26.640 --> 30:27.060]  Very popular.
[30:27.060 --> 30:27.600]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[30:27.600 --> 30:28.420]  I think he's on ESPN, isn't he?
[30:28.420 --> 30:28.880]  Yeah, he's on ESPN's podcast.
[30:29.020 --> 30:31.940]  Yeah, he's started to do some commentating as well.
[30:32.520 --> 30:33.800]  Desmond Bain, rookie!
[30:34.380 --> 30:36.860]  Now that is actually a decent fucking card
[30:36.860 --> 30:38.980]  because Desmond Bain has turned out to be an awesome,
[30:39.200 --> 30:39.620]  awesome player.
[30:40.000 --> 30:41.640]  Built like a fucking brick.
[30:41.840 --> 30:43.020]  The dude is just huge.
[30:43.560 --> 30:44.780]  It's a base rookie, but whatever.
[30:44.940 --> 30:45.460]  Who does he play for?
[30:45.880 --> 30:46.880]  He plays for the Memphis Grizzlies.
[30:47.320 --> 30:48.800]  His teammate is now Marcus Smart.
[30:49.000 --> 30:51.580]  And then Kimball Walker, dominance card.
[30:51.820 --> 30:54.740]  Wearing that fucking, that unfortunate
[30:54.740 --> 30:56.200]  Celtic City jersey that year.
[30:56.520 --> 30:57.520]  I think I actually have one.
[30:58.600 --> 30:59.380]  There you go.
[31:00.060 --> 31:00.380]  Unfortunate.
[31:01.040 --> 31:02.080]  I mean, I'm fortunate to have it.
[31:02.220 --> 31:02.300]  Yeah.
[31:02.340 --> 31:03.740]  It just wasn't the prettiest city jersey.
[31:03.760 --> 31:03.880]  Oh, I understand.
[31:05.440 --> 31:08.440]  He's also another great basketball player
[31:08.440 --> 31:10.660]  who had knees like the Panini box we just opened,
[31:10.760 --> 31:11.120]  unfortunately.
[31:11.360 --> 31:11.860]  That's tough.
[31:11.980 --> 31:12.660]  Took him out of the league.
[31:12.820 --> 31:13.140]  Paninis.
[31:13.560 --> 31:14.000]  Oh, shit.
[31:14.120 --> 31:14.440]  Paninis.
[31:14.900 --> 31:15.500]  I'll take that.
[31:15.780 --> 31:16.820]  This is a good fucking box.
[31:16.860 --> 31:17.060]  Really?
[31:17.280 --> 31:17.380]  It's peaking.
[31:17.420 --> 31:17.620]  Yeah.
[31:17.640 --> 31:18.060]  All right, let's see.
[31:18.140 --> 31:18.560]  I was peaking.
[31:18.740 --> 31:18.980]  What we got?
[31:19.300 --> 31:22.560]  We got Kobe White, sophomore stars.
[31:22.580 --> 31:22.780]  Great.
[31:23.100 --> 31:23.420]  Insert.
[31:23.520 --> 31:24.280]  It's not worth anything, it's fine.
[31:24.560 --> 31:24.680]  Cool.
[31:25.160 --> 31:26.420]  CJ Ellaby, base rookie.
[31:26.440 --> 31:27.220]  Not worth anything, it's fine.
[31:27.220 --> 31:29.740]  Geoff Teague played himself out of the league.
[31:30.560 --> 31:33.100]  He played for the Celtics one year
[31:33.100 --> 31:34.100]  toward the end of his career.
[31:34.280 --> 31:36.440]  And then a Nick Claxton.
[31:36.620 --> 31:37.060]  Whoa!
[31:37.660 --> 31:38.980]  Rookie pinmanship auto.
[31:39.200 --> 31:39.940]  Hey, how about that?
[31:40.100 --> 31:40.980]  That is not bad.
[31:41.060 --> 31:45.700]  It is not numbered, but it is a fucking auto.
[31:47.540 --> 31:48.380]  On card or sticker?
[31:48.400 --> 31:49.480]  Sticker auto, but still.
[31:49.860 --> 31:50.700]  Claxton's a good player.
[31:51.040 --> 31:51.780]  That's a good card.
[31:52.340 --> 31:52.680]  Take that.
[31:52.980 --> 31:53.040]  Do you want double sleeve?
[31:53.080 --> 31:53.680]  Sleeve that, please.
[31:53.800 --> 31:54.880]  Yeah, double sleeve, definitely.
[31:55.300 --> 31:55.860]  All autos, please.
[31:55.860 --> 31:57.560]  What's the deal with Nick Claxton?
[31:57.740 --> 31:58.520]  I don't know anything about him.
[31:58.520 --> 31:59.440]  I've never heard of him before.
[31:59.900 --> 32:02.200]  He's a role player, young player, a lot of potential.
[32:02.580 --> 32:03.600]  I think he's still on.
[32:04.180 --> 32:04.540]  Brooklyn?
[32:05.020 --> 32:05.380]  Brooklyn.
[32:06.300 --> 32:07.080]  I'm actually not sure.
[32:07.820 --> 32:09.000]  They've had a lot of...
[32:09.000 --> 32:09.580]  Switch around?
[32:09.760 --> 32:10.300]  Turn over?
[32:10.300 --> 32:11.600]  A lot of turn over in the last couple years.
[32:12.640 --> 32:15.080]  Montez Harrell, I'm not sure who he's playing for right now.
[32:15.820 --> 32:16.860]  Frick on Cormacs.
[32:17.720 --> 32:18.960]  What a fucking name!
[32:19.100 --> 32:23.080]  I think Cormacs is not with Philly anymore.
[32:23.220 --> 32:23.740]  I can't remember.
[32:25.120 --> 32:28.920]  Miles Turner, and then a Tyrell Terry
[32:30.980 --> 32:33.620]  Green Parallel rookie, Prison Parallel.
[32:34.080 --> 32:35.560]  Not a major role for him, but that's a nice card.
[32:35.920 --> 32:36.180]  Cool.
[32:36.480 --> 32:38.060]  That's a really nice card, so we'll sleeve that.
[32:38.260 --> 32:40.120]  Okay, so that box ended up being pretty good
[32:40.120 --> 32:42.240]  despite the fact that the mail truck ran it over.
[32:42.340 --> 32:42.820]  A little decent one, you know?
[32:43.720 --> 32:46.340]  Let's open up some more non-sports cards, though.
[32:46.540 --> 32:48.340]  Let's get into...
[32:52.260 --> 32:52.620]  Yeah!
[32:52.640 --> 32:53.260]  Let's have a little bit of fun.
[32:55.820 --> 32:58.800]  I saw some RoboCop 2 cards online, they were real cheap.
[32:58.880 --> 33:01.060]  I thought, I don't think we've ever opened up a RoboCop 2 cards.
[33:01.140 --> 33:02.300]  How do you feel about RoboCop?
[33:03.200 --> 33:04.000]  I like RoboCop.
[33:04.320 --> 33:05.700]  Who can even remember RoboCop?
[33:05.860 --> 33:07.040]  Let's watch, let's look at this and see.
[33:07.300 --> 33:09.420]  Definitely a thing where it's like, you know, here's RoboCop.
[33:09.700 --> 33:10.540]  He's no Terminator.
[33:11.520 --> 33:14.000]  There's a Hob, and I can't remember that lady's name
[33:14.000 --> 33:14.580]  that's with him.
[33:14.620 --> 33:16.680]  She was the one that, yeah, she was like his little sidekick.
[33:16.680 --> 33:18.140]  She worked at the art gallery, right?
[33:18.220 --> 33:19.000]  She was like an art dealer.
[33:20.380 --> 33:22.100]  Then we have the Robotics Museum.
[33:22.820 --> 33:23.240]  That's the...
[33:23.720 --> 33:24.420]  What is that?
[33:24.480 --> 33:25.960]  Do you remember what the company was called?
[33:26.180 --> 33:26.440]  OCP.
[33:28.160 --> 33:30.720]  OCP, yeah, that's their...
[33:31.000 --> 33:32.160]  Communications Museum, yeah.
[33:32.600 --> 33:34.540]  It's the, what does OCP stand for?
[33:34.820 --> 33:38.420]  It was the Omni Consumer Products.
[33:38.840 --> 33:39.620]  Omni Consumer Products.
[33:40.660 --> 33:42.160]  Man or Machine.
[33:42.900 --> 33:45.660]  This is when, man, RoboCop's have some trouble
[33:45.660 --> 33:47.440]  trying to determine if he's still a man or not.
[33:47.480 --> 33:49.620]  He keeps driving by his wife's house,
[33:49.900 --> 33:52.800]  and he's like, and she files a suit against the city
[33:52.800 --> 33:54.820]  and is like, tell him to leave me alone.
[33:55.040 --> 33:58.720]  But then she comes to the OCP, or the police,
[33:58.940 --> 34:00.420]  to talk to him, and she's like,
[34:00.480 --> 34:01.240]  do you remember me at all?
[34:01.260 --> 34:02.820]  And he's like, he does, but he's like,
[34:02.860 --> 34:04.200]  Harry and the Hendersons and her,
[34:04.340 --> 34:06.400]  so he's like, I am a robot, I don't remember you.
[34:06.420 --> 34:08.140]  And she's like, and she...
[34:08.140 --> 34:09.600]  Yeah, they're like, this is too much for her.
[34:09.680 --> 34:11.600]  We're gonna give you some alone time with her.
[34:13.320 --> 34:14.760]  Memories of me...
[34:15.500 --> 34:16.160]  Oh, God.
[34:17.240 --> 34:18.560]  That's, what the fuck?
[34:18.860 --> 34:20.880]  I think that's the cage that they keep him in.
[34:20.880 --> 34:22.460]  That's an odd ending.
[34:22.580 --> 34:23.980]  They do, you're right, they lock him up
[34:23.980 --> 34:26.120]  so he won't escape, even though he's RoboCop
[34:26.120 --> 34:27.120]  and he can walk through that.
[34:29.000 --> 34:30.420]  Storyboard, about to pounce.
[34:31.160 --> 34:33.620]  That's when they make Kane, the drug dealer,
[34:33.860 --> 34:34.880]  who's pushing nuke.
[34:35.020 --> 34:36.000]  Remember, that was the drug.
[34:36.480 --> 34:37.380]  He's pushing the drug nuke,
[34:37.420 --> 34:38.480]  and everybody was addicted to it.
[34:38.500 --> 34:40.720]  It's a designer drug, and he was making nuke blue
[34:40.720 --> 34:43.620]  and nuke green and nuke red, and nuke ice.
[34:43.620 --> 34:45.160]  The warehouse fight.
[34:45.400 --> 34:49.140]  Yeah, and what happens is, OCP,
[34:49.600 --> 34:50.640]  I'm not sure if I remember this right,
[34:50.660 --> 34:54.020]  OCP, they fucking, they kill Kane,
[34:54.580 --> 34:55.860]  or RoboCop beats Kane, finally,
[34:56.260 --> 34:57.780]  and then they take him out of the hospital
[34:57.780 --> 34:59.820]  and they fucking take his brain out
[34:59.820 --> 35:01.260]  and they put him in this monster,
[35:01.460 --> 35:04.280]  and then they show his face with his brain out of it,
[35:04.320 --> 35:05.500]  they're holding it and handing it around,
[35:05.580 --> 35:06.220]  it's fucking weird.
[35:06.420 --> 35:07.500]  Just squiggling around.
[35:08.240 --> 35:09.080]  If memory serves.
[35:10.160 --> 35:11.200]  When did this movie come out?
[35:11.760 --> 35:13.840]  These cards came out in...
[35:13.840 --> 35:14.500]  Did you see it in the theater?
[35:14.540 --> 35:14.900]  1990.
[35:15.780 --> 35:16.000]  No.
[35:16.360 --> 35:18.540]  RoboCop 2, when I was four, I did not see...
[35:18.540 --> 35:21.060]  It was the ED-209 missile assault,
[35:21.180 --> 35:22.500]  I gotta admit, I don't remember that.
[35:23.720 --> 35:25.560]  Here we have, oh, Showdown.
[35:26.960 --> 35:28.420]  We were talking about this the other day,
[35:28.540 --> 35:31.720]  in the 80s and 90s, doesn't it seem like every film,
[35:31.840 --> 35:33.700]  every action film in the 80s and 90s
[35:33.700 --> 35:35.860]  took place in an industrial warehouse?
[35:36.100 --> 35:37.220]  Yeah, I think there was just,
[35:37.320 --> 35:40.180]  I think that's part of what was happening in the 80s,
[35:40.580 --> 35:42.940]  where there was this hyper-industrialization
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.960]  going everywhere, and this building boom,
[35:46.960 --> 35:49.940]  so I think you just had these lots, and it was just easy.
[35:50.040 --> 35:52.840]  This was also, it was filmed in the 90s,
[35:52.900 --> 35:57.020]  and it was supposed to take place in Detroit in 2018 or 2015.
[35:57.020 --> 35:57.740]  Something like that, yeah.
[35:57.920 --> 35:59.660]  And so they're just talking about how Detroit
[35:59.660 --> 36:01.920]  went downhill and is being owned by a private corporation.
[36:02.020 --> 36:04.980]  Detroit goes bankrupt and can't pay the bills,
[36:05.600 --> 36:07.860]  and a private corporation's trying to steal Detroit
[36:07.860 --> 36:09.340]  from Detroit, and it's like,
[36:09.580 --> 36:11.060]  holy shit, was this a prescient film.
[36:11.300 --> 36:12.180]  Really understood.
[36:12.420 --> 36:14.780]  The new mission, I believe that's when RoboCop
[36:14.780 --> 36:17.220]  decides to fight OCP.
[36:18.000 --> 36:18.840]  That's a cool pose.
[36:19.120 --> 36:20.140]  That's RoboCop right there.
[36:20.280 --> 36:21.420]  Say goodnight, Ed.
[36:23.480 --> 36:24.900]  RoboCop fucks that dude up.
[36:25.340 --> 36:27.940]  Oh, and then here's correcting his mistakes.
[36:28.080 --> 36:30.260]  That's when the head of OCP decides
[36:30.260 --> 36:32.920]  that he's gonna undo the RoboCop problem
[36:32.920 --> 36:35.640]  by creating the new, more powerful RoboCop
[36:35.640 --> 36:36.580]  out of the drug dealer.
[36:36.780 --> 36:38.460]  Seems like he's gonna blame it on a woman.
[36:38.820 --> 36:40.480]  Yep, seems like RoboCop,
[36:40.540 --> 36:42.220]  there should be a RoboCop video game.
[36:42.340 --> 36:43.060]  Like a new one.
[36:43.260 --> 36:43.900]  There should be a new one.
[36:43.900 --> 36:44.660]  Not like a Sega.
[36:44.760 --> 36:45.320]  There probably was.
[36:45.820 --> 36:47.560]  There were like a bunch of RoboCop games,
[36:47.680 --> 36:50.080]  but like, feels like it's ripe
[36:50.080 --> 36:52.180]  for making something happen here.
[36:52.420 --> 36:56.420]  Here's a sticker of RoboCop laying down next to a car.
[36:56.560 --> 36:57.980]  Oh yeah, that's the new license plates.
[36:58.000 --> 36:58.580]  The license plates.
[36:59.180 --> 37:00.180]  Those are fucking awesome.
[37:00.300 --> 37:01.240]  I wonder if you can buy those anywhere.
[37:01.720 --> 37:03.080]  Storyboard taking the plunge.
[37:03.140 --> 37:06.360]  That's another fight between RoboCop and...
[37:06.360 --> 37:08.160]  RoboCop 2 is actually what they called it.
[37:08.480 --> 37:10.500]  I believe they called Kane RoboCop 2.
[37:11.360 --> 37:12.500]  In the clutches of Kane,
[37:12.500 --> 37:15.940]  this is now before, this is the first half of the movie,
[37:16.940 --> 37:17.300]  when...
[37:17.300 --> 37:19.140]  At the sludge, or the nuke factory.
[37:19.460 --> 37:22.340]  In the sludge factory, old abandoned sludge factory,
[37:22.480 --> 37:23.820]  which is a nuke factory.
[37:24.060 --> 37:25.060]  But what is sludge?
[37:25.700 --> 37:26.880]  Why would there be a sludge factory?
[37:26.880 --> 37:27.620]  They put it in their neck.
[37:27.980 --> 37:28.680]  No, that's nuke.
[37:28.940 --> 37:30.080]  Nuke, but wait, what's sludge?
[37:30.080 --> 37:31.900]  But they said it was like the nuke factory's
[37:31.900 --> 37:34.140]  operating out of the old abandoned sludge factory.
[37:34.260 --> 37:34.760]  Oh, no.
[37:34.760 --> 37:35.820]  I just don't know what sludge is.
[37:37.380 --> 37:39.000]  RoboCop means business, ain't that for sure.
[37:39.000 --> 37:39.820]  God damn.
[37:39.880 --> 37:40.500]  Although there was a...
[37:40.500 --> 37:40.940]  That's RoboCop.
[37:40.960 --> 37:42.280]  There was a period, if I remember correctly,
[37:42.280 --> 37:44.620]  of RoboCop 2, where they changed his protocols
[37:44.620 --> 37:45.440]  and he was nice.
[37:46.080 --> 37:47.420]  And remember people kept shooting him
[37:47.420 --> 37:48.160]  and making fun of him?
[37:48.200 --> 37:48.540]  Oh, that's right.
[37:48.680 --> 37:49.560]  The kids spray painted him.
[37:49.560 --> 37:51.500]  Where he was like, let's talk about this.
[37:52.100 --> 37:52.460]  Freeze.
[37:53.940 --> 37:56.120]  I mean, the problem with RoboCop is that
[37:56.120 --> 37:57.360]  he's always got like a juicy booty,
[37:57.620 --> 38:00.600]  but you can't take his like thighs, like scary.
[38:00.940 --> 38:01.640]  Shielded from harm.
[38:01.740 --> 38:03.080]  This happens a lot in RoboCop,
[38:03.180 --> 38:05.020]  where another cop will just stand behind him
[38:05.020 --> 38:06.300]  and let him soak up the bullets.
[38:06.400 --> 38:06.820]  That's his little partner girl.
[38:07.000 --> 38:08.420]  I don't think it is.
[38:08.520 --> 38:10.040]  I mean, it's supposed to be, but I can't...
[38:10.040 --> 38:10.840]  It doesn't look like her.
[38:10.880 --> 38:12.020]  Someone said there's a RoboCop game
[38:12.020 --> 38:12.420]  coming out.
[38:12.620 --> 38:14.820]  RoboCop Rogue City comes out September, 2023.
[38:14.960 --> 38:16.220]  Somebody said gameplay looks slow,
[38:16.260 --> 38:17.160]  which is lore accurate.
[38:17.320 --> 38:18.360]  I don't give a fuck.
[38:18.720 --> 38:23.660]  What's lore accurate to RoboCop, the robot cop?
[38:24.640 --> 38:25.460]  He's the like...
[38:26.120 --> 38:26.220]  Lore accurate?
[38:26.620 --> 38:27.760]  Is it fun?
[38:27.960 --> 38:29.180]  No, it's lore accurate.
[38:31.700 --> 38:34.080]  Now, forgive me if I'm misremembering this,
[38:34.140 --> 38:36.240]  but I believe this is the scene in RoboCop 2
[38:36.240 --> 38:39.140]  where that's Kane on the right, who looks like a...
[38:39.140 --> 38:40.620]  Honestly, he looks like a bald,
[38:40.620 --> 38:41.840]  stretched out Peter Dinklage.
[38:42.380 --> 38:46.780]  And then Hobb, who was like the little kid bad guy.
[38:47.140 --> 38:50.280]  When Kane dies, Hobb becomes the main bad guy, briefly.
[38:50.680 --> 38:51.460]  And then he gets taken out.
[38:51.720 --> 38:53.500]  But this is the part where they use a jackhammer
[38:53.500 --> 38:54.780]  to rip RoboCop apart.
[38:54.960 --> 38:56.140]  And they take all of his parts
[38:56.140 --> 38:57.740]  and they pull up in front of the police station
[38:57.740 --> 38:59.020]  and they open the back door of a car
[38:59.020 --> 39:01.040]  and just dump RoboCop on the ground and drive off.
[39:01.300 --> 39:02.800]  He's like bad blank check.
[39:03.040 --> 39:05.460]  Like he's the same age, same kind of vibe.
[39:05.680 --> 39:06.000]  That's funny.
[39:06.080 --> 39:06.340]  But evil.
[39:08.200 --> 39:09.980]  And then Metal Justice.
[39:09.980 --> 39:11.460]  I'll say, I'll say.
[39:11.880 --> 39:12.420]  Those are fun.
[39:12.760 --> 39:12.980]  Yeah.
[39:13.320 --> 39:15.680]  I hope I didn't misremember any of that
[39:15.680 --> 39:16.940]  RoboCop 2 knowledge.
[39:17.900 --> 39:18.600]  I hope.
[39:19.280 --> 39:19.860]  I hope.
[39:20.200 --> 39:21.860]  I hope you remembered all of it accurately.
[39:22.160 --> 39:23.860]  And then you don't have to watch RoboCop 2 again.
[39:25.100 --> 39:26.420]  Let's definitely not do that.
[39:27.540 --> 39:28.280]  How about this?
[39:28.540 --> 39:29.060]  This will be interesting.
[39:29.980 --> 39:32.840]  2017 Top Series 1 Baseball.
[39:32.980 --> 39:34.060]  I think...
[39:35.300 --> 39:37.020]  Oh, I don't know who the rookies are in this,
[39:37.080 --> 39:38.320]  but there's some high value cards.
[39:38.340 --> 39:39.060]  What year was this?
[39:39.060 --> 39:39.760]  2017.
[39:40.920 --> 39:41.500]  2017.
[39:42.320 --> 39:43.240]  Let's see what we got.
[39:43.880 --> 39:49.000]  Tyler Flowers, Jacob deGrom, Matt Stram,
[39:49.960 --> 39:53.040]  Jake Barrett, Jonathan Villar.
[39:53.200 --> 39:54.120]  Ooh, here we go.
[39:54.200 --> 39:55.220]  Mike Trout.
[39:55.360 --> 39:56.560]  Let's go ahead and sleeve that.
[39:57.100 --> 39:58.480]  I guess that'd be worth saving.
[39:58.700 --> 39:58.940]  Is it?
[39:59.000 --> 39:59.660]  Yeah, we'll go with both.
[40:00.680 --> 40:03.500]  Andrew Kashner, Michael Bourne identity.
[40:04.100 --> 40:05.560]  How about name is a movie?
[40:05.900 --> 40:05.940]  Okay.
[40:07.280 --> 40:11.920]  Hector Santiago, Alex Bregman, rookie top cup.
[40:12.000 --> 40:12.720]  Let's sleeve that.
[40:12.920 --> 40:13.140]  Interesting.
[40:13.240 --> 40:14.260]  There might be some value there.
[40:14.380 --> 40:14.640]  Maybe.
[40:15.720 --> 40:22.300]  Albert Pujols, Chris Davis, Corey Dickerson, Steven Souza.
[40:23.140 --> 40:24.360]  Is it Souza or Suiza?
[40:24.560 --> 40:24.840]  Do you know?
[40:26.020 --> 40:28.120]  I wanna say Souza, but boy, that doesn't seem right.
[40:28.260 --> 40:30.960]  Adam Wainwright, Jake Lamb.
[40:31.700 --> 40:32.520]  Name is an animal.
[40:32.560 --> 40:33.340]  Yeah, that's a zoo.
[40:33.700 --> 40:34.100]  Zoo.
[40:34.160 --> 40:34.940]  That's a zoo, baby.
[40:35.460 --> 40:36.500]  Oh, shit.
[40:36.620 --> 40:36.960]  What you got?
[40:37.160 --> 40:40.080]  I wonder if this is a SP or something.
[40:40.220 --> 40:40.680]  Probably not.
[40:40.780 --> 40:41.420]  But this is cool.
[40:41.580 --> 40:42.520]  You're gonna fucking love this.
[40:42.700 --> 40:43.880]  Both of you are gonna fucking love this.
[40:44.460 --> 40:46.560]  First pitch, John Lovitz.
[40:48.660 --> 40:49.140]  John Lovitz.
[40:49.140 --> 40:49.780]  That's maybe the best one.
[40:49.880 --> 40:50.800]  That's the hit, baby.
[40:51.860 --> 40:53.380]  That's the hit of the fucking day right there.
[40:53.560 --> 40:55.140]  John Lovitz in casual clothes.
[40:55.620 --> 40:56.440]  Look at his junk and pants.
[40:56.440 --> 40:58.900]  The critic himself in his jeans.
[40:59.060 --> 40:59.880]  He's ready to go.
[40:59.920 --> 41:00.420]  There you go.
[41:00.460 --> 41:01.020]  Sleeve it, baby.
[41:01.020 --> 41:03.160]  John Lovitz playing Satan in the people's court
[41:03.160 --> 41:04.480]  might be the funniest thing.
[41:04.480 --> 41:05.340]  It's pretty good.
[41:05.500 --> 41:05.760]  Ever.
[41:07.820 --> 41:09.620]  He said, oh wait, John, wait,
[41:09.700 --> 41:11.140]  ask to throw out the first pitch.
[41:11.340 --> 41:11.840]  You know what he said?
[41:11.960 --> 41:12.100]  What?
[41:12.260 --> 41:13.360]  Yeah, that's the ticket.
[41:14.500 --> 41:15.360]  No, no, no, no.
[41:15.360 --> 41:15.720]  Ha, ha, ha.
[41:16.020 --> 41:17.060]  Here we have a...
[41:17.060 --> 41:17.600]  That's funny.
[41:18.440 --> 41:21.120]  Topps, 30th anniversary, 87 retro,
[41:21.240 --> 41:22.760]  Tyler Glasner rookie.
[41:23.020 --> 41:23.760]  Glasner rookie, sorry.
[41:23.800 --> 41:23.980]  Glasner, yeah.
[41:24.520 --> 41:25.580]  Let's go ahead and sleeve that.
[41:25.600 --> 41:26.560]  It might have some money in it.
[41:27.280 --> 41:29.100]  Rick Porcello, Cy Young award.
[41:29.960 --> 41:32.920]  We have Archie Bradley doing an interesting...
[41:32.920 --> 41:33.720]  That's a...
[41:33.720 --> 41:34.520]  Karate kick.
[41:34.580 --> 41:35.480]  He's doing like a sideways,
[41:35.600 --> 41:36.900]  he's doing like his whole body's like sideways.
[41:37.160 --> 41:37.800]  Yeah, I'm not sure what...
[41:37.800 --> 41:38.100]  Karate is a good one.
[41:38.320 --> 41:39.920]  I'm not sure what that is, but let's sleeve it.
[41:41.460 --> 41:42.020]  Jason Grilly.
[41:44.420 --> 41:45.460]  Luke Weaver rookie.
[41:45.760 --> 41:46.500]  Might as well sleeve that.
[41:46.580 --> 41:47.260]  I don't know who that is though.
[41:47.900 --> 41:48.720]  Chicago White Sox.
[41:49.100 --> 41:49.780]  What is this, 2017?
[41:50.380 --> 41:51.540]  All right, we're not dog shit yet.
[41:51.640 --> 41:51.980]  There you go.
[41:52.180 --> 41:53.040]  Give it time, give it time.
[41:53.260 --> 41:54.400]  I read an article today that says...
[41:54.400 --> 41:55.860]  Still no leaders in that locker room.
[41:55.900 --> 41:56.260]  It's all right.
[41:56.460 --> 41:58.260]  Chicago White Sox are the most disappointing team
[41:58.260 --> 41:59.100]  of the last five years.
[41:59.940 --> 42:00.200]  Wow.
[42:00.220 --> 42:01.200]  That's probably true.
[42:01.380 --> 42:01.660]  Yeah.
[42:02.840 --> 42:03.640]  Northern Highlights.
[42:03.800 --> 42:06.340]  That's a cool handshake thing they have going on there.
[42:06.640 --> 42:07.920]  It's like a secret handshake.
[42:08.260 --> 42:09.180]  Aroldis Chapman.
[42:09.360 --> 42:10.180]  It is like a secret handshake.
[42:10.560 --> 42:11.580]  Oh, we have another kick.
[42:12.700 --> 42:14.360]  Dude, that is like a C-shape.
[42:14.700 --> 42:15.420]  Like that is...
[42:15.420 --> 42:16.420]  Oh, he made a letter.
[42:16.740 --> 42:16.960]  Yeah.
[42:17.240 --> 42:17.820]  Make a letter.
[42:18.400 --> 42:18.660]  Alphabet.
[42:18.820 --> 42:19.380]  Body's a letter.
[42:19.600 --> 42:19.980]  Alphabet.
[42:21.120 --> 42:21.940]  I hope I don't fuck this up.
[42:22.700 --> 42:25.000]  Yangerva Solarte with another hot fucking awesome...
[42:25.000 --> 42:25.840]  Yeah, that's a good one.
[42:25.920 --> 42:26.340]  That's another one.
[42:26.700 --> 42:27.100]  That's...
[42:27.100 --> 42:28.140]  Yeah, that's like a yoga move.
[42:28.200 --> 42:31.460]  Byron Buxton, which is pretty fucking good.
[42:31.460 --> 42:33.860]  Man, he is small in that.
[42:35.060 --> 42:35.420]  2017?
[42:35.820 --> 42:36.320]  Byron Buxton.
[42:36.360 --> 42:36.720]  Wow.
[42:37.020 --> 42:38.440]  I'm gonna save that as a baseball name.
[42:38.460 --> 42:39.260]  Did he have worms?
[42:39.300 --> 42:40.040]  Rick Porcello.
[42:40.260 --> 42:40.620]  What?
[42:40.760 --> 42:41.400]  Oh, he might have had worms.
[42:41.620 --> 42:43.080]  No, no, no, no, he's young there.
[42:43.660 --> 42:44.980]  It's not like he's much bigger.
[42:45.120 --> 42:45.600]  He developed worms.
[42:45.600 --> 42:46.900]  But he's...
[42:46.900 --> 42:47.940]  Then he had to get treatment.
[42:48.020 --> 42:48.740]  Brandon Belt.
[42:51.320 --> 42:52.040]  Troy Tulewitzki.
[42:52.340 --> 42:52.560]  Yeah.
[42:53.040 --> 42:53.580]  Tulo, baby.
[42:54.460 --> 42:56.080]  Travis Darnard, or Darno.
[42:56.200 --> 42:57.140]  I don't know how to say that.
[42:57.200 --> 42:58.020]  He looks exhausted.
[42:58.160 --> 42:59.860]  He's just like, oh God, this thing again.
[43:00.420 --> 43:01.340]  I feel like this is a card.
[43:01.340 --> 43:03.880]  And I love Tim Anderson, although he's had a rough year.
[43:04.160 --> 43:05.360]  Tim Anderson has had a rough year.
[43:05.360 --> 43:07.880]  Tim Anderson is Tim Anderson's biggest enemy.
[43:08.040 --> 43:08.300]  Yes.
[43:08.580 --> 43:09.200]  Who's Tim Anderson?
[43:09.360 --> 43:10.260]  He plays for the White Sox.
[43:10.340 --> 43:11.260]  He's the guy that got knocked out a couple days ago.
[43:11.260 --> 43:14.440]  He was the guy who hit the home run
[43:14.440 --> 43:16.260]  at the Field of Dreams game and everything.
[43:16.260 --> 43:16.840]  He was the guy.
[43:16.900 --> 43:18.220]  This is the new star.
[43:18.620 --> 43:19.560]  This is the guy.
[43:19.640 --> 43:19.880]  Okay.
[43:20.020 --> 43:21.460]  And then he started getting in fights.
[43:21.540 --> 43:22.760]  He's hitting like 240.
[43:23.020 --> 43:24.660]  He was an over 300 hitter every year.
[43:24.820 --> 43:25.180]  He was.
[43:25.540 --> 43:26.940]  When he hit a home run the other day,
[43:26.960 --> 43:28.260]  it was the first home run he'd hit in over a year.
[43:28.360 --> 43:28.580]  Yep.
[43:28.940 --> 43:31.120]  And then he got hit by another dude.
[43:31.120 --> 43:31.940]  In the head?
[43:32.340 --> 43:32.440]  Yeah.
[43:33.160 --> 43:34.320]  He started a fight.
[43:34.500 --> 43:35.200]  He started a fight.
[43:35.440 --> 43:35.760]  What?
[43:36.200 --> 43:37.720]  Yeah, he started a fight with another player
[43:37.720 --> 43:38.680]  and that player knocked him out.
[43:38.760 --> 43:39.720]  They had to carry him off the field.
[43:39.880 --> 43:40.200]  What?
[43:40.920 --> 43:41.700]  Yeah, like two weeks ago.
[43:41.840 --> 43:43.680]  I didn't show it to you because it's my team
[43:43.680 --> 43:44.580]  and it was pretty embarrassing.
[43:45.120 --> 43:45.700]  It is very embarrassing.
[43:45.700 --> 43:46.660]  But anyway, here's the Tim Anderson
[43:46.660 --> 43:47.240]  card I'm talking about.
[43:47.260 --> 43:48.280]  And it does feel like...
[43:48.280 --> 43:49.820]  He should have been the guy, man.
[43:50.180 --> 43:51.800]  Like he had everything lined up.
[43:51.920 --> 43:53.740]  This feels like a, like almost like a ballerina.
[43:54.760 --> 43:55.080]  Yeah.
[43:55.360 --> 43:55.940]  Like Swan Lake.
[43:55.940 --> 43:58.280]  I think he would go into like the yoga moves.
[43:58.620 --> 43:59.020]  Like a yoga?
[43:59.280 --> 44:00.580]  It looks like a pirouette kind of.
[44:01.000 --> 44:01.400]  Plié.
[44:03.460 --> 44:04.260]  Kendris Morales.
[44:04.740 --> 44:06.540]  By the way, I've never opened 2017 tops either.
[44:06.680 --> 44:07.620]  There's a lot of firsts for me.
[44:08.020 --> 44:09.060]  Wilson Ramos.
[44:09.700 --> 44:10.500]  Clint Robinson.
[44:11.160 --> 44:12.420]  And Keon Broxton.
[44:13.520 --> 44:13.920]  Okay.
[44:14.680 --> 44:15.400]  That was fun.
[44:16.040 --> 44:16.760]  I enjoyed that.
[44:16.960 --> 44:18.480]  Want to give Eric some wrestling?
[44:18.620 --> 44:19.520]  Yeah, let's do some wrestling.
[44:19.800 --> 44:20.020]  Okay.
[44:20.260 --> 44:21.240]  Eric, do you want to open up some...
[44:21.240 --> 44:21.840]  Oh, I love it.
[44:21.900 --> 44:23.920]  2021 WWE, I believe it is?
[44:23.920 --> 44:26.400]  Let's do some 2021 WWE.
[44:26.560 --> 44:27.460]  Now, do you remember 2021?
[44:27.980 --> 44:28.380]  Absolutely.
[44:29.060 --> 44:29.880]  Is Jason Momoa in this?
[44:29.880 --> 44:32.140]  He does look like Jason Momoa, but unfortunately he's not.
[44:32.380 --> 44:32.880]  And Harley Quinn?
[44:32.940 --> 44:33.800]  He's Roman Reigns.
[44:33.940 --> 44:34.960]  And that's Alexa Bliss.
[44:35.240 --> 44:36.680]  She married Ryan Cabrera.
[44:37.200 --> 44:37.920]  Oh, really?
[44:38.100 --> 44:38.620]  Crazy, right?
[44:38.840 --> 44:38.880]  Who's Ryan Cabrera?
[44:39.220 --> 44:40.880]  A good singer from the early 2000s?
[44:40.880 --> 44:41.120]  Yeah.
[44:41.500 --> 44:41.840]  Oh, I don't know.
[44:41.840 --> 44:43.300]  A guy you would never know.
[44:43.300 --> 44:43.460]  No.
[44:43.780 --> 44:44.140]  Oh, okay.
[44:46.040 --> 44:49.420]  WWE Champion Drew McIntyre defeats Dolph Ziggler
[44:50.060 --> 44:51.500]  in an extreme rules match.
[44:51.560 --> 44:52.740]  So the rules were extreme?
[44:52.820 --> 44:55.460]  They were really like tough rules.
[44:55.560 --> 44:56.120]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[44:56.240 --> 44:57.440]  Wow, these rules are too much!
[44:57.740 --> 44:59.000]  Yeah, they're extreme.
[44:59.820 --> 45:00.300]  RKO?
[45:00.680 --> 45:02.260]  Yep, a phenomenal swerve.
[45:02.300 --> 45:03.180]  Ugly fucking card.
[45:03.460 --> 45:04.820]  Oh, we got...
[45:04.820 --> 45:05.640]  Look at those shorts.
[45:05.640 --> 45:07.700]  Look at the shorts that Randy Orton is wearing.
[45:07.900 --> 45:09.980]  Look at those $5 Walmart-ass shorts.
[45:10.460 --> 45:12.360]  This has been an interesting episode for cards.
[45:13.080 --> 45:14.800]  Here's Shayna Baszler.
[45:15.160 --> 45:17.260]  Shayna Baszler is an MMA fighter.
[45:17.700 --> 45:19.220]  She came in with Ronda Rousey.
[45:19.560 --> 45:19.960]  Ronda Rousey's friends.
[45:19.980 --> 45:20.820]  Oh, she's still in MMA?
[45:21.100 --> 45:22.380]  Yeah, she does it here and there,
[45:22.480 --> 45:24.180]  but like, she's a pro wrestler.
[45:24.580 --> 45:25.860]  We got a wrestling meme card.
[45:25.940 --> 45:26.340]  All right.
[45:26.480 --> 45:28.020]  From WrestleMania.
[45:28.020 --> 45:28.900]  Hit me, baby.
[45:29.120 --> 45:29.400]  We have.
[45:29.500 --> 45:29.880]  What a meme.
[45:31.380 --> 45:33.020]  Authentic matte relic, which I mean,
[45:33.140 --> 45:36.680]  I guess it means it was used in a wrestling...
[45:36.680 --> 45:38.000]  Oh, it's Otis!
[45:38.340 --> 45:39.580]  The big man!
[45:39.920 --> 45:40.500]  Hell yeah!
[45:40.900 --> 45:42.040]  He looks like Action Bronson.
[45:42.120 --> 45:44.580]  Oh, Otis rules.
[45:44.980 --> 45:45.700]  Who is Otis?
[45:45.740 --> 45:46.440]  What's his deal?
[45:46.580 --> 45:46.880]  Who is he?
[45:47.300 --> 45:53.040]  He's a former, like, wrestler, like amateur wrestler.
[45:53.320 --> 45:54.580]  And then he's great.
[45:54.640 --> 45:55.380]  He has so much charisma.
[45:55.440 --> 45:56.000]  He's a lot of fun.
[45:56.040 --> 45:56.780]  He's a really cool guy.
[45:56.780 --> 45:58.860]  So this would be, if it's the matte,
[45:58.980 --> 46:00.980]  then it's anything from WrestleMania 35.
[46:01.180 --> 46:02.600]  Yeah, I mean, that's the, yeah,
[46:02.700 --> 46:04.120]  the matte that they wrestled on.
[46:04.500 --> 46:04.820]  Dang.
[46:05.120 --> 46:06.380]  Dang, and it's numbered, huh?
[46:06.540 --> 46:07.100]  That's cool.
[46:07.240 --> 46:07.640]  Is it numbered?
[46:07.680 --> 46:08.200]  Oh yeah, it is.
[46:08.280 --> 46:09.160]  You gotta sleeve it, baby.
[46:10.000 --> 46:10.760]  Let's sleeve this.
[46:10.920 --> 46:12.360]  That might not fit a sleeve.
[46:12.520 --> 46:13.520]  If it doesn't, let me know.
[46:13.640 --> 46:14.820]  I have thick sleeves somewhere.
[46:15.660 --> 46:17.140]  Otis' blue collar solid.
[46:17.300 --> 46:18.180]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:19.360 --> 46:19.680]  Wow.
[46:19.960 --> 46:21.040]  Well, anyway, let me know if you can...
[46:21.040 --> 46:22.740]  Now he's in a group called American Alpha.
[46:23.460 --> 46:23.660]  Ooh.
[46:24.820 --> 46:25.140]  Oh, you got it.
[46:25.180 --> 46:25.460]  Okay, cool.
[46:25.460 --> 46:26.080]  I did it.
[46:26.840 --> 46:27.560]  You did it.
[46:27.620 --> 46:28.160]  I did it.
[46:28.780 --> 46:30.600]  Well, we got about 10 minutes left.
[46:30.880 --> 46:32.640]  Maybe we should transition over to some of the...
[46:32.640 --> 46:33.280]  You wanna do something big here?
[46:33.520 --> 46:33.920]  The big stuff.
[46:34.000 --> 46:35.540]  You wanna do the stuff you're so proud of?
[46:35.540 --> 46:37.560]  I don't know if I promoted at the beginning or not,
[46:37.620 --> 46:38.200]  but I forgot to.
[46:38.300 --> 46:38.540]  It's okay.
[46:38.540 --> 46:39.500]  But I'm pretty excited about some stuff.
[46:39.660 --> 46:40.080]  Let's do it.
[46:40.200 --> 46:41.880]  Last week, we opened up Bowman U.
[46:42.040 --> 46:43.800]  I said we were looking for Victor Wiminyama's.
[46:44.580 --> 46:46.600]  Eric mentioned that Victor Wiminyama didn't go to college.
[46:46.700 --> 46:48.600]  That's true, but he, and neither did Scoot Henderson,
[46:48.920 --> 46:49.720]  but they're all in this.
[46:49.860 --> 46:50.440]  I double-checked.
[46:50.540 --> 46:51.960]  Yeah, and you sent the picture to me,
[46:52.000 --> 46:53.200]  and it's like, what?
[46:53.200 --> 46:54.760]  Like, it's from his French League.
[46:54.920 --> 46:55.060]  Yeah.
[46:55.260 --> 46:56.580]  What, that's not college.
[46:56.660 --> 46:57.860]  That's the French League.
[46:58.280 --> 46:59.120]  Hey, man, it's in here.
[46:59.460 --> 47:02.020]  It validated me buying it, that's for sure.
[47:02.300 --> 47:03.680]  So I felt pretty stupid for a second.
[47:04.140 --> 47:05.540]  Then I was like, no, I'm pretty sure I checked.
[47:06.380 --> 47:07.000]  Turns out I did check.
[47:07.160 --> 47:08.080]  Do you have to feed the sack?
[47:08.580 --> 47:10.920]  Gotta feed the sack with that pack.
[47:11.640 --> 47:12.160]  Sack pack.
[47:12.820 --> 47:13.160]  Yum, yum.
[47:14.380 --> 47:15.940]  I need, like, an eating noise.
[47:17.960 --> 47:18.500]  That's good.
[47:18.740 --> 47:19.000]  Okay.
[47:19.860 --> 47:20.220]  Great.
[47:20.640 --> 47:22.980]  All right, so we're looking for the Thompson twins.
[47:22.980 --> 47:24.320]  We're looking for Scoot Henderson.
[47:24.560 --> 47:25.640]  We're looking for Brandon Miller.
[47:25.960 --> 47:28.200]  Or we're looking for Victor Wimbenyama.
[47:28.420 --> 47:29.680]  Or, as always, Grady Dick.
[47:29.800 --> 47:29.920]  Yeah.
[47:30.060 --> 47:30.660]  We love our Grady Dick.
[47:30.940 --> 47:31.780]  Big dickheads.
[47:31.920 --> 47:32.620]  Dejohn Harris.
[47:32.720 --> 47:33.680]  We are huge dickheads.
[47:34.640 --> 47:35.860]  Trice Jackson Baez.
[47:37.380 --> 47:38.180]  Mikey Williams.
[47:38.840 --> 47:39.440]  Hey, we got an...
[47:39.440 --> 47:40.100]  Hey!
[47:40.720 --> 47:41.000]  All right.
[47:41.120 --> 47:41.760]  Is that a, okay.
[47:42.060 --> 47:43.080]  All right, I mean, we can see it.
[47:43.360 --> 47:43.920]  Oh, okay, yeah.
[47:44.140 --> 47:45.000]  Chance Westry.
[47:45.740 --> 47:48.660]  And then an autograph of Haley Cavender.
[47:49.000 --> 47:49.760]  Sticker on it.
[47:50.940 --> 47:52.400]  She plays for the Hurricanes.
[47:53.180 --> 47:54.640]  Hurricanes got clout.
[47:55.160 --> 47:56.880]  15 of 99, there you go.
[47:56.940 --> 47:58.440]  That's gonna be the auto of the box,
[47:58.520 --> 48:00.800]  so we're not getting Victor, probably.
[48:00.980 --> 48:04.860]  But maybe we'll get a parallel or an insert.
[48:05.200 --> 48:08.940]  Is this what the Grady Dick, like, his little outfit is?
[48:09.080 --> 48:10.160]  No, that's a Topps Now.
[48:10.380 --> 48:11.020]  It's a little different.
[48:11.460 --> 48:13.140]  Jaden Zachary, that's just one you buy online.
[48:13.280 --> 48:14.160]  Anthony Black.
[48:15.220 --> 48:15.940]  Here we go.
[48:16.900 --> 48:17.700]  Asterio Morris.
[48:17.900 --> 48:18.360]  Ooh, that's cool.
[48:18.360 --> 48:18.880]  Flashing lights.
[48:19.120 --> 48:19.280]  UT.
[48:20.080 --> 48:23.220]  And then we have an Oscar Tishawabi.
[48:24.740 --> 48:26.940]  And then Jeremy Roach.
[48:27.100 --> 48:27.440]  Clapping.
[48:27.560 --> 48:28.220]  It's a refractor.
[48:29.440 --> 48:30.500]  Three more packs of this,
[48:30.580 --> 48:32.580]  then we're gonna open up maybe some Recon,
[48:32.820 --> 48:34.300]  and then I'm gonna end it with Monopoly.
[48:34.380 --> 48:35.960]  I got more fucking Prism Monopoly.
[48:36.180 --> 48:37.520]  I thought you said no more of those.
[48:37.580 --> 48:38.220]  Ready to be disappointed.
[48:38.220 --> 48:38.960]  Yeah, but I found another box.
[48:40.220 --> 48:41.100]  JJ Starling.
[48:42.340 --> 48:43.220]  Keyshawn Bartholomew.
[48:44.040 --> 48:44.920]  Mark Armstrong.
[48:47.160 --> 48:48.040]  Bowman Masterpieces.
[48:48.540 --> 48:49.740]  Here's Jairus Walker.
[48:50.440 --> 48:51.140]  Let's leave that.
[48:51.580 --> 48:53.180]  And then Brandon Murray.
[48:54.280 --> 48:54.580]  Refractor.
[48:54.880 --> 48:55.760]  From the Hoyas.
[48:56.680 --> 48:57.540]  How you feeling about these?
[48:57.680 --> 48:59.060]  I mean, you got the hit early,
[48:59.280 --> 48:59.980]  so you're kind of like,
[49:00.540 --> 49:02.020]  dopamine's gonna be a little bit low on this one, you know?
[49:02.560 --> 49:03.060]  Sorry, man.
[49:03.720 --> 49:04.920]  Sorry, let me boost it up.
[49:05.100 --> 49:05.280]  Hold on a second.
[49:05.300 --> 49:05.620]  Okay, here we go.
[49:06.600 --> 49:07.200]  Jalen Cook.
[49:07.400 --> 49:08.340]  Yay, here we go.
[49:09.140 --> 49:09.740]  Judah Mintz.
[49:09.900 --> 49:10.800]  Whoa, that's a great name.
[49:10.820 --> 49:11.200]  That's food.
[49:11.780 --> 49:12.820]  That is, Judah Mintz is a food.
[49:12.820 --> 49:13.760]  Judah Mintz is something I would eat.
[49:14.660 --> 49:15.260]  Will Richardson.
[49:16.380 --> 49:16.980]  Amari Bailey.
[49:17.660 --> 49:18.260]  Flashing Lights.
[49:18.460 --> 49:19.440]  And Caitlin Clark.
[49:19.440 --> 49:20.200]  Oh, that's cool.
[49:20.300 --> 49:20.820]  Caitlin Clark.
[49:21.560 --> 49:22.600]  Refractor, we'll take that.
[49:23.080 --> 49:25.420]  And then, last pack.
[49:25.540 --> 49:26.040]  Last pack.
[49:26.300 --> 49:26.620]  Mojo.
[49:29.160 --> 49:31.080]  We have Trey Alexander.
[49:31.560 --> 49:32.560]  We have Haley Cavender.
[49:32.660 --> 49:33.360]  That's who we got the autograph from.
[49:33.360 --> 49:34.020]  Yeah, it is, yeah.
[49:34.020 --> 49:34.580]  It's very cool.
[49:35.040 --> 49:35.980]  Jalen Bridges.
[49:36.080 --> 49:37.060]  Tyler Campbell.
[49:37.560 --> 49:39.740]  And then Kamari Lands.
[49:40.260 --> 49:41.220]  That's also Refractor.
[49:41.280 --> 49:41.860]  We'll save that.
[49:42.360 --> 49:43.500]  These are two, but eh.
[49:44.040 --> 49:44.300]  Okay.
[49:44.940 --> 49:45.940]  Boy, those are...
[49:46.660 --> 49:47.020]  Yeah.
[49:47.120 --> 49:47.420]  Yeah.
[49:48.280 --> 49:49.120]  That's what those are.
[49:49.200 --> 49:49.680]  All right, what are you feeling?
[49:49.980 --> 49:51.880]  I'm gonna open up one more non-sports pack.
[49:52.040 --> 49:52.240]  Okay.
[49:52.840 --> 49:54.040]  And then we'll go into my...
[49:54.040 --> 49:55.200]  That was cool.
[49:55.820 --> 49:56.180]  Whoa.
[49:56.740 --> 49:57.100]  Whoa.
[49:57.380 --> 49:58.420]  Wow, it must be really good.
[49:58.500 --> 49:59.160]  It's hopping out of there.
[49:59.320 --> 50:00.080]  Whoa, boy!
[50:00.260 --> 50:02.000]  This is Yo! MTV Raps.
[50:02.160 --> 50:03.060]  These are jumping to get out.
[50:03.100 --> 50:04.900]  You can win a trip to New York City
[50:04.900 --> 50:06.740]  and see Yo! MTV Raps live.
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.780]  Don't know if that's gonna...
[50:09.780 --> 50:11.240]  It would be cool to start a collection
[50:11.240 --> 50:14.100]  of those that are unredeemable.
[50:14.220 --> 50:14.340]  Yeah.
[50:14.340 --> 50:15.480]  Like, yeah.
[50:15.900 --> 50:16.340]  Oh!
[50:17.120 --> 50:18.040]  Fucking off to a great start.
[50:18.720 --> 50:20.380]  MC Hammer himself.
[50:20.700 --> 50:21.720]  Too legit to quit.
[50:21.840 --> 50:22.320]  Please, Hammer.
[50:22.980 --> 50:23.540]  Don't hurt him.
[50:24.400 --> 50:25.420]  LL Cool J.
[50:25.780 --> 50:27.880]  His mother wanted him to fight you.
[50:27.980 --> 50:28.360]  It's true.
[50:28.820 --> 50:29.520]  She did not like you.
[50:29.900 --> 50:30.760]  Public Enemy.
[50:31.960 --> 50:33.620]  Yeah, she said knock you out.
[50:33.840 --> 50:34.040]  Okay.
[50:34.300 --> 50:36.320]  Here we have Flavor Flav and Chuck D.
[50:36.520 --> 50:38.380]  And the S to S1Ws.
[50:38.580 --> 50:39.320]  My favorite.
[50:39.900 --> 50:41.740]  I listened to more of Public Enemy growing up
[50:41.740 --> 50:43.220]  than probably any other musician.
[50:43.580 --> 50:44.200]  Oh, that's cool.
[50:44.400 --> 50:44.720]  I was a kid, dude.
[50:45.120 --> 50:45.840]  Takes a nation to millions.
[50:45.920 --> 50:46.460]  Hold us back.
[50:46.580 --> 50:46.860]  Yeah, man.
[50:47.120 --> 50:47.980]  Fear of a black planet.
[50:48.120 --> 50:48.660]  Oh, my God.
[50:48.820 --> 50:49.760]  You're gonna fight the power.
[50:49.940 --> 50:50.560]  I watched Flavor of Love with Bridget Nelson.
[50:51.520 --> 50:52.060]  I watched them fall in love.
[50:52.060 --> 50:52.200]  That's true.
[50:52.280 --> 50:53.100]  You watched Flavor of Love.
[50:53.200 --> 50:54.860]  I watched the girl shit on the staircase
[50:54.860 --> 50:55.640]  because she was in love with him.
[50:55.680 --> 50:56.400]  That's like Rick.
[50:56.600 --> 50:57.720]  That's like Rick, y'all.
[50:58.200 --> 50:58.740]  He was awesome.
[50:58.840 --> 51:00.640]  Digital Underground had one song.
[51:01.180 --> 51:02.620]  Digital Underground had two cards,
[51:02.660 --> 51:03.260]  but one song.
[51:03.360 --> 51:04.440]  Well, there's Humpty in both of them.
[51:04.480 --> 51:05.100]  Yeah, there he is.
[51:05.300 --> 51:07.620]  Vanilla Ice has one song.
[51:07.980 --> 51:08.440]  There you go.
[51:08.600 --> 51:09.200]  That's ice cream.
[51:09.880 --> 51:11.180]  Day Lost Soul.
[51:11.360 --> 51:12.360]  There you go.
[51:12.780 --> 51:14.140]  Belle Biv DeVoe.
[51:14.500 --> 51:14.980]  Poison.
[51:15.460 --> 51:15.600]  Poison.
[51:15.700 --> 51:17.140]  That girl is poison.
[51:18.260 --> 51:20.540]  I do trust your big butt and your smile.
[51:21.060 --> 51:21.220]  Tone Love.
[51:21.220 --> 51:21.700]  You can't.
[51:22.760 --> 51:23.440]  Is he dead?
[51:24.260 --> 51:24.740]  No.
[51:24.820 --> 51:25.040]  No?
[51:25.240 --> 51:25.940]  No, he's not dead.
[51:26.900 --> 51:27.840]  Boogie Down Productions.
[51:27.920 --> 51:28.520]  There's KRS-One.
[51:28.700 --> 51:29.020]  Nice.
[51:29.220 --> 51:31.420]  And then the man himself, Flavor Flav.
[51:32.300 --> 51:34.480]  And then, oh, let's just see if we're an instant winner.
[51:35.000 --> 51:35.240]  Okay.
[51:36.200 --> 51:36.900]  Do you scratch it?
[51:37.320 --> 51:37.500]  Yeah.
[51:41.520 --> 51:42.200]  What's it say?
[51:43.120 --> 51:43.560]  Sorry.
[51:44.420 --> 51:45.080]  Try again.
[51:45.380 --> 51:45.740]  We didn't win.
[51:46.020 --> 51:46.640]  That's okay, though.
[51:47.700 --> 51:49.180]  All right, now that we've done that,
[51:49.240 --> 51:50.720]  here's what I saved for the end.
[51:51.020 --> 51:51.240]  Okay.
[51:51.260 --> 51:52.300]  Got the box of Recon.
[51:52.520 --> 51:54.480]  Now, this I paid about 250 bucks for.
[51:55.020 --> 51:57.640]  And this fucking, here's the thing about this show.
[51:58.100 --> 52:00.340]  This show has turned me into a patient man.
[52:00.560 --> 52:03.160]  I bought this four months ago.
[52:03.240 --> 52:03.440]  Okay.
[52:03.980 --> 52:06.380]  I have stepped over it in my closet every day
[52:06.380 --> 52:08.660]  for four months thinking, who knows what's in there?
[52:08.980 --> 52:09.540]  I bought it.
[52:09.620 --> 52:11.000]  I paid 250 bucks for it.
[52:11.000 --> 52:14.060]  But I'm gonna hold onto it until a later date
[52:14.060 --> 52:14.580]  when it's appropriate.
[52:14.680 --> 52:16.440]  And then these fucking Monopoly cards
[52:16.440 --> 52:17.940]  that I can't seem to stop buying.
[52:18.160 --> 52:19.080]  You have to stop.
[52:19.180 --> 52:20.880]  You said last time, Monopoly's done.
[52:21.140 --> 52:22.640]  Yeah, well, maybe after this one it is.
[52:23.020 --> 52:24.520]  This is definitely the bigger...
[52:24.520 --> 52:25.580]  Spoken like a true addict.
[52:26.280 --> 52:26.900]  No, I'm kidding.
[52:27.560 --> 52:28.820]  Well, the next one, the next one.
[52:28.920 --> 52:29.180]  The next one.
[52:29.180 --> 52:30.620]  The next one will be the one that I hit.
[52:30.640 --> 52:32.200]  Just one more, just one more.
[52:33.540 --> 52:34.640]  All right, you ready for Recon?
[52:34.760 --> 52:35.620]  What are you hoping for?
[52:36.320 --> 52:38.020]  This is this year's Recon,
[52:38.320 --> 52:40.620]  so I'm hoping for Rookie Auto.
[52:40.620 --> 52:43.520]  Do you feed the pack sack with these or no?
[52:43.640 --> 52:45.080]  Yeah, it's fucking frustrating.
[52:45.480 --> 52:46.980]  And I don't like doing it.
[52:47.560 --> 52:48.240]  There you go.
[52:48.380 --> 52:48.940]  That's the one.
[52:50.060 --> 52:51.380]  But the rules are the rules,
[52:51.580 --> 52:53.080]  so we have to feed the pack sack
[52:53.080 --> 52:54.860]  with a very expensive pack.
[52:55.460 --> 52:56.580]  I hope it's okay in there.
[52:57.060 --> 52:58.140]  Don't get all dinged up.
[52:58.420 --> 52:59.780]  Let's open up some or most of these.
[52:59.880 --> 53:00.480]  We'll watch the time,
[53:00.560 --> 53:01.920]  because we gotta end on this.
[53:02.900 --> 53:04.940]  That might be the one you wanna open later, or?
[53:05.140 --> 53:05.900]  We'll open that pack last.
[53:05.920 --> 53:06.260]  Okay.
[53:06.460 --> 53:06.740]  Ooh!
[53:09.720 --> 53:10.980]  We're looking for Marcus Smart.
[53:11.260 --> 53:11.560]  Always.
[53:12.060 --> 53:13.340]  And then just looking for Rookie cards.
[53:13.460 --> 53:14.100]  I'll tell you as I see.
[53:14.100 --> 53:15.560]  That one says Rookie right on it.
[53:16.180 --> 53:17.440]  This is Rookie...
[53:17.880 --> 53:18.500]  Rookie, Rookie.
[53:19.180 --> 53:19.840]  Rookie, Rookie.
[53:20.220 --> 53:21.020]  It's Christian Braun,
[53:21.180 --> 53:22.840]  or Christian Brown, I believe it's pronounced.
[53:23.020 --> 53:23.540]  This is a nice card.
[53:23.640 --> 53:24.080]  We'll just leave that.
[53:24.400 --> 53:24.580]  Okay.
[53:24.880 --> 53:26.120]  Jake LaRavia, Rookie.
[53:26.460 --> 53:27.220]  Eh, just leave it.
[53:28.040 --> 53:29.040]  Kenny Lofton, Jr.
[53:29.100 --> 53:30.600]  I don't think Kenny Lofton, Jr.
[53:30.840 --> 53:33.740]  is the son of Kenny Lofton, the baseball player.
[53:33.820 --> 53:34.600]  Different, different.
[53:34.680 --> 53:35.600]  I think they're different Loftons,
[53:35.600 --> 53:37.660]  but I have this guy's,
[53:37.720 --> 53:39.400]  I have one of this guy's college Rookie cards
[53:39.400 --> 53:41.860]  because it is one of the most unflattering photos.
[53:42.020 --> 53:42.380]  Oh, really?
[53:42.440 --> 53:43.520]  In the history of sports.
[53:43.840 --> 53:44.460]  So I bought it.
[53:44.520 --> 53:45.440]  I'll bring it on and show it to you.
[53:45.460 --> 53:45.600]  Okay.
[53:46.660 --> 53:48.740]  So I'm already a fan of Kenneth Lofton, Jr.
[53:48.760 --> 53:49.460]  just because of that card.
[53:49.500 --> 53:49.660]  Cool.
[53:49.880 --> 53:52.640]  Reggie Bullock, Damian Lillard,
[53:52.960 --> 53:54.160]  causing problems for the NBA.
[53:54.460 --> 53:54.960]  Oh, there you go.
[53:55.020 --> 53:55.880]  LeBron James.
[53:56.000 --> 53:56.820]  LeBron James.
[53:57.860 --> 53:58.840]  Just leave all LeBrons.
[54:00.800 --> 54:02.500]  Is he going to his 21st season?
[54:02.580 --> 54:03.040]  Is that right?
[54:03.200 --> 54:03.280]  Yeah.
[54:03.840 --> 54:05.080]  Who, does he have the longest,
[54:05.080 --> 54:07.260]  how long has PJ Tucker been in the...
[54:07.260 --> 54:08.000]  Not nearly as long.
[54:08.140 --> 54:08.840]  He's pretty old, but not...
[54:08.840 --> 54:10.340]  So who has the longest season run?
[54:10.480 --> 54:10.700]  Really?
[54:10.860 --> 54:11.260]  Yeah, nobody.
[54:11.560 --> 54:12.720]  Nobody from LeBron's...
[54:12.720 --> 54:16.240]  He's only the eighth player to make it 21 seasons.
[54:16.500 --> 54:16.740]  Okay.
[54:16.860 --> 54:18.380]  I think, yeah, I don't think anybody
[54:18.380 --> 54:20.580]  from his draft class is still in.
[54:20.700 --> 54:22.460]  But who has played in the NBA history
[54:22.460 --> 54:24.200]  has had the longest season run?
[54:25.200 --> 54:25.880]  Karl Malone, maybe?
[54:27.000 --> 54:28.020]  I don't know if he has.
[54:28.040 --> 54:30.300]  Karl Malone or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
[54:30.700 --> 54:31.600]  one of those guys, maybe.
[54:31.720 --> 54:32.480]  There are some dudes...
[54:32.480 --> 54:35.080]  But LeBron's stats for people
[54:35.080 --> 54:36.880]  that are going into that longevity
[54:36.880 --> 54:38.420]  are insane, comparatively.
[54:38.800 --> 54:40.780]  Not worth anything, and I don't like Bam on a bio,
[54:40.900 --> 54:41.960]  but this is a cool parallel.
[54:42.140 --> 54:43.360]  Or a cool insert, rather.
[54:43.480 --> 54:44.400]  Rock the rim.
[54:44.960 --> 54:47.780]  Here we go, Big Cat, numbered 121 to 299.
[54:48.820 --> 54:50.700]  That's a cool card, we'll sleeve that.
[54:50.860 --> 54:52.620]  Like Big Cat, John Morant-based.
[54:53.640 --> 54:54.720]  Oh, here we go, Grant Williams,
[54:55.040 --> 54:56.200]  no longer a Celtic.
[54:58.040 --> 54:58.480]  Sucks.
[54:59.340 --> 55:01.500]  I get it, but...
[55:01.500 --> 55:03.920]  Grant Williams is kind of like the annoying little brother
[55:03.920 --> 55:05.740]  that you loved and hated at the same time
[55:05.740 --> 55:08.300]  for the Celtics, but he was a lot of heart,
[55:08.480 --> 55:09.620]  and I'm sad to see him go,
[55:09.700 --> 55:10.420]  but he's playing for Dallas.
[55:10.520 --> 55:12.120]  Is he the one that made candles for everyone?
[55:12.260 --> 55:14.140]  He took a candle-making class his rookie year
[55:14.140 --> 55:16.180]  and then made candles for every employee
[55:16.180 --> 55:16.940]  of the organization.
[55:17.320 --> 55:17.560]  Fucking hilarious.
[55:18.160 --> 55:18.680]  200 candles.
[55:19.000 --> 55:19.420]  Just the sweetest.
[55:19.600 --> 55:20.320]  Just the sweetest.
[55:20.400 --> 55:23.080]  Grayson Allen, one of the least likeable guys in the NBA.
[55:23.540 --> 55:23.720]  Why?
[55:23.820 --> 55:24.020]  I think.
[55:24.500 --> 55:25.360]  He's a dirty player.
[55:25.840 --> 55:28.040]  He, yeah, he sucks.
[55:28.640 --> 55:29.700]  Norman Powell, okay.
[55:29.700 --> 55:31.680]  Let's open up at least one,
[55:31.840 --> 55:32.620]  let's open up this one.
[55:32.780 --> 55:35.040]  You got five more minutes,
[55:35.140 --> 55:36.200]  so you gotta figure out what you wanna do.
[55:36.260 --> 55:37.780]  We gotta get them prisms open.
[55:38.180 --> 55:40.220]  Oh, shit, look at this.
[55:40.300 --> 55:40.940]  We got something good here?
[55:41.780 --> 55:42.140]  Maybe.
[55:42.440 --> 55:42.640]  Okay.
[55:43.360 --> 55:45.260]  I'll have to look this up, or maybe not,
[55:45.320 --> 55:47.820]  but it looks too good not to be a little rare.
[55:48.000 --> 55:48.240]  Oh, nice.
[55:48.240 --> 55:50.280]  Here's a Recon World Traveler card.
[55:50.680 --> 55:51.500]  Chris Stapps Porzingis.
[55:51.540 --> 55:52.220]  Chris Stapps.
[55:52.300 --> 55:53.580]  Says here he plays for the Wizards.
[55:53.640 --> 55:54.120]  That's incorrect.
[55:54.320 --> 55:56.340]  He actually plays for the Boston Celtics!
[55:56.340 --> 55:57.620]  There we go.
[55:58.660 --> 56:00.960]  Tyrese Halliburton, Hallie7499,
[56:00.980 --> 56:02.720]  currently tearing it up on Team USA right now.
[56:02.780 --> 56:03.740]  There we go.
[56:04.900 --> 56:05.700]  Derrick Rose.
[56:06.240 --> 56:08.160]  See that video somebody posted on TikTok
[56:08.160 --> 56:10.720]  of him standing outside a building,
[56:10.880 --> 56:11.920]  getting into a fight on the phone,
[56:12.260 --> 56:13.080]  in his workout gear?
[56:13.160 --> 56:13.820]  No, that's awesome.
[56:13.840 --> 56:15.320]  And the dude's like, is that Derrick Rose?
[56:15.360 --> 56:16.520]  And the guy's like, there's no way that's Derrick Rose.
[56:16.540 --> 56:17.720]  And the dude's like, that's Derrick Rose,
[56:17.740 --> 56:18.760]  and he is getting into it.
[56:18.840 --> 56:19.880]  And it's just him yelling at the door.
[56:20.080 --> 56:20.600]  That's cool.
[56:20.900 --> 56:23.220]  Andrew Wiggins, confusing career.
[56:23.840 --> 56:24.640]  Kyle Lowry.
[56:26.760 --> 56:27.640]  Devin Booker.
[56:27.860 --> 56:29.660]  Okay, we'll open one more pack of Recon.
[56:29.860 --> 56:29.980]  Okay.
[56:30.120 --> 56:31.420]  And then we're going into the Monopolies.
[56:31.700 --> 56:33.400]  We got Monopolies, which you know are good, baby.
[56:33.560 --> 56:36.140]  And then you'll come back next week for even more.
[56:36.280 --> 56:39.760]  Keegan Murray, rookie, future Legends card.
[56:39.880 --> 56:40.480]  That's cool.
[56:40.580 --> 56:40.780]  Okay.
[56:42.260 --> 56:44.080]  Here we go, Draymond Green.
[56:44.580 --> 56:47.280]  Yeah, step on people, jump on people.
[56:47.500 --> 56:48.440]  Here's our...
[56:48.440 --> 56:49.640]  Scratch their eyes out.
[56:50.160 --> 56:51.900]  Here's our rookie auto.
[56:53.780 --> 56:54.660]  Jabbar Walker.
[56:56.100 --> 56:56.420]  Nice.
[56:56.700 --> 56:58.360]  Numbered to 149.
[56:58.560 --> 56:59.640]  That's a cool card, let's save that.
[56:59.920 --> 57:01.120]  The chat is saying Vince Carter.
[57:01.960 --> 57:02.440]  What about Vince Carter?
[57:02.440 --> 57:04.500]  I assume maybe the longest running thing.
[57:04.560 --> 57:05.660]  Oh, Vince Carter's a great one.
[57:05.760 --> 57:07.240]  Yeah, he played until he was 41 or 42.
[57:07.520 --> 57:08.020]  22 seasons.
[57:08.100 --> 57:08.580]  22 seasons.
[57:09.740 --> 57:10.380]  Kennedy Chandler.
[57:11.480 --> 57:11.840]  There you go.
[57:12.080 --> 57:12.660]  That's a great call.
[57:12.820 --> 57:13.760]  22 seasons, fuck.
[57:14.500 --> 57:14.820]  MPJ.
[57:15.580 --> 57:16.740]  And then Jakob Pertl.
[57:18.460 --> 57:19.260]  Okay, there we go.
[57:19.520 --> 57:20.360]  All right, you ready for Monopoly?
[57:20.520 --> 57:21.300]  Let's open up Monopoly.
[57:21.460 --> 57:22.660]  All right, we got four minutes.
[57:22.960 --> 57:23.660]  We'll get to these...
[57:23.660 --> 57:24.560]  Well, probably three and a half.
[57:24.560 --> 57:25.780]  V-Con bangers later.
[57:26.200 --> 57:26.420]  All right.
[57:26.500 --> 57:27.060]  Here we go.
[57:27.260 --> 57:27.920]  You missed.
[57:28.180 --> 57:30.840]  Just remember that you stopped opening the other ones
[57:30.840 --> 57:32.140]  for this when you opened these.
[57:32.240 --> 57:32.500]  Yes.
[57:32.620 --> 57:32.960]  Okay.
[57:35.040 --> 57:36.720]  What was the good card we got last year?
[57:36.800 --> 57:38.820]  A year two Cade Cunningham parallel.
[57:40.640 --> 57:41.560]  Did you not cut all the...
[57:41.560 --> 57:41.980]  That side.
[57:42.140 --> 57:43.060]  Yeah, you didn't cut all of them.
[57:43.480 --> 57:44.100]  They don't always...
[57:44.100 --> 57:45.460]  Well, a lot of the ones we got from last week
[57:45.460 --> 57:47.340]  were like a dollar, two dollars.
[57:47.600 --> 57:47.960]  Yeah.
[57:48.200 --> 57:49.560]  And how much was this box?
[57:50.140 --> 57:50.600]  20 bucks.
[57:51.520 --> 57:52.960]  25 dollars, I think is what it costs.
[57:53.080 --> 57:53.540]  Not crazy.
[57:53.540 --> 57:54.900]  That's not bad.
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.780]  It's average price for a blaster.
[57:57.940 --> 58:00.100]  It just comes in a weird box, but it's just a blaster.
[58:00.200 --> 58:01.380]  Oh, okay.
[58:01.480 --> 58:02.080]  Okay, here we go.
[58:03.140 --> 58:05.680]  We'll open these, take us out, and then...
[58:05.680 --> 58:07.000]  Oh, we won't see you next week.
[58:07.660 --> 58:08.920]  Yeah, next week we won't be here,
[58:08.980 --> 58:11.320]  because it's vacation, and again, we do most Mondays.
[58:11.360 --> 58:11.980]  Labor Day, right?
[58:12.260 --> 58:12.380]  Yeah.
[58:12.440 --> 58:12.900]  Labor Dave.
[58:13.400 --> 58:15.000]  So we're gonna take Labor Dave off.
[58:15.660 --> 58:16.680]  So we won't see you next week,
[58:16.720 --> 58:17.720]  but we'll see you the week after.
[58:18.600 --> 58:19.960]  And also, if you get a chance,
[58:20.340 --> 58:21.880]  maybe watch, listen to Fuckface.
[58:22.100 --> 58:22.300]  Yeah.
[58:22.300 --> 58:23.600]  Listen to Fuckface.
[58:23.800 --> 58:25.800]  Listen to So All Right podcast,
[58:25.980 --> 58:27.460]  and we've got so much other content.
[58:28.180 --> 58:29.180]  So All Right is Geoff's new podcast,
[58:29.300 --> 58:30.060]  if you haven't checked it out yet.
[58:30.380 --> 58:32.160]  Here's the normal bog-standard boring...
[58:32.160 --> 58:32.720]  It's Cade!
[58:33.080 --> 58:35.780]  Here's a Chet bass rookie, we'll sleeve that.
[58:35.900 --> 58:38.580]  LaMelo, Jimmy Butler, Jimmy Buckets.
[58:40.560 --> 58:42.920]  Let's see, let's prepare to be disappointed.
[58:43.320 --> 58:45.500]  Colin Sexton, Benedict Matherin,
[58:45.600 --> 58:47.120]  De'Aaron Fox, and...
[58:47.120 --> 58:48.200]  God damn it.
[58:48.300 --> 58:48.640]  What'd you got?
[58:48.640 --> 58:52.300]  Numbered to 500, Gold Shimmer, Drew Holliday.
[58:52.560 --> 58:54.140]  So it is a hit, it is a parallel.
[58:54.400 --> 58:55.560]  Yeah, it's a hit!
[58:56.020 --> 58:58.580]  But it's Drew Holliday, so it's not worth anything.
[58:58.740 --> 58:59.020]  What do you mean?
[58:59.140 --> 59:00.780]  We'll look it up, we'll look it up.
[59:01.220 --> 59:02.460]  I'll report back to you with the value on that card.
[59:02.460 --> 59:04.420]  In two weeks, you'll know how much Drew Holliday's worth.
[59:04.560 --> 59:06.020]  Keegan Murray, bass rookie.
[59:06.660 --> 59:08.500]  Jalen Duren, bass rookie.
[59:08.620 --> 59:10.600]  Jalen Suggs, this is the Jalen box.
[59:11.620 --> 59:12.920]  Mark Williams, bass rookie.
[59:12.940 --> 59:14.120]  Never heard of Mark Williams.
[59:14.340 --> 59:14.400]  No.
[59:16.760 --> 59:18.040]  Why do you wanna sleeve him?
[59:18.040 --> 59:19.660]  They're rookies, sleeve all rookie cards.
[59:20.900 --> 59:23.940]  De'Jante Murray, Rudy Gobert,
[59:24.840 --> 59:29.200]  who just lost in the World Games, right?
[59:29.400 --> 59:32.780]  Steph Curry, we'll sleeve...
[59:32.780 --> 59:33.060]  Nah, fuck it.
[59:33.360 --> 59:34.580]  And then John Morant, bass.
[59:34.920 --> 59:35.160]  Yeah!
[59:36.020 --> 59:37.460]  I bet you fucking Drew Holliday
[59:37.460 --> 59:38.700]  was the only good card you could get out of this.
[59:38.780 --> 59:39.160]  Yes!
[59:39.280 --> 59:40.160]  But at least it was one good card.
[59:40.160 --> 59:42.280]  Two more packs, and then we are done!
[59:42.360 --> 59:43.180]  Jayden Ivey, bass.
[59:43.300 --> 59:43.760]  Here we go!
[59:43.940 --> 59:44.740]  Cole Anthony.
[59:44.980 --> 59:45.440]  Cole Anthony!
[59:45.440 --> 59:48.200]  Scary Terry Rogier, Bam Adebayo.
[59:48.240 --> 59:49.720]  And there we go, last pack, last pack, Mojo!
[59:50.000 --> 59:50.500]  Last pack!
[59:51.620 --> 59:52.880]  All right, here we go, we're rubbing with Dallas.
[59:52.960 --> 59:54.140]  We get some Dallas luck on this.
[59:54.800 --> 59:56.720]  Okay, and we have...
[59:56.720 --> 59:57.160]  Here we go.
[59:58.420 --> 59:59.000]  Dog shit.
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:03.460]  Donovan Mitchell, Tyrese Maxey, LeBron James.
[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:03.860]  LeBron James.
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:06.720]  We'll sleeve that, and a Paul George bass card.
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:07.620]  PG-13!
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:09.540]  What a lump of shit.
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:11.100]  There we go.
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.860]  All right, that'll do it for today.
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:13.620]  That was a fast hour.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:14.720]  Thank you for tuning in.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:15.840]  It went real fast.
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:18.060]  We went from bingo to Dallas to RoboCop
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.720]  to fucking NBA to YomTV Raps.
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:23.740]  Hopefully that was enough variety for you.
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:24.940]  And...
[01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:26.240]  We're only getting after one person, I guess.
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:27.260]  We'll see you in two weeks.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:27.720]  Two weeks.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.620]  You won't be here next week, the week after.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.080]  Enjoy your labor, Dave.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.680]  And I hope you have a good time.
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:35.120]  Break show, again, two weeks.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:36.900]  Listen to F*** Face.
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:38.940]  Check out So All Right, Geoff's new podcast.
[01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:40.100]  Listen to ANMA.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.960]  There's all kinds of podcasts that we have for you.
[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.180]  All kinds of old content here.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.480]  We have four episodes of this.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:45.320]  We'll see you next time.
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.400]  Yeah, and if you're in Austin,
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.140]  get your haircut by Emily.
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:47.820]  Bye.
[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:48.580]  Bye.
