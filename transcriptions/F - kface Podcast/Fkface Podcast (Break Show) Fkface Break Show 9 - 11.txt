[00:07.880 --> 00:08.880]  And we're back.
[00:09.100 --> 00:11.200]  Hello and welcome to another Break Show.
[00:11.400 --> 00:13.320]  You missed us last week, we missed you too.
[00:13.400 --> 00:16.720]  But we were on vacation. We were non-laboring on Labor Day.
[00:16.740 --> 00:18.400]  We were non-laboring on Labor Day.
[00:18.560 --> 00:20.440]  Had a lovely day. What'd you do? Did you do anything fun?
[00:21.760 --> 00:24.300]  I don't remember. Was it Monday?
[00:24.600 --> 00:25.500]  Neither do I.
[00:26.000 --> 00:26.720]  What happened?
[00:26.900 --> 00:28.660]  I have no clue. We might have hung out.
[00:28.680 --> 00:29.360]  Did we hang out?
[00:29.380 --> 00:31.240]  We might have, we might have not. I really don't remember.
[00:31.620 --> 00:32.300]  What did we do?
[00:32.540 --> 00:32.960]  I don't know.
[00:33.120 --> 00:33.660]  Where am I?
[00:34.220 --> 00:35.220]  This is the Break Show, Eric.
[00:35.220 --> 00:35.740]  Oh, fantastic.
[00:35.740 --> 00:36.460]  Thanks for asking.
[00:37.000 --> 00:38.700]  And every week, most weeks.
[00:39.100 --> 00:40.080]  Every week, most weeks.
[00:40.100 --> 00:41.940]  Almost every week, most weeks.
[00:42.900 --> 00:47.540]  On Mondays, we'll open up a bunch of wacky sports and non-sports related cards with you.
[00:47.620 --> 00:51.400]  As we're building the greatest collection ever assembled.
[00:51.680 --> 00:53.180]  And we're going to do it right here in front of you.
[00:53.220 --> 00:59.360]  Oh my God, Eric, I just saw the backdrop and I remembered that I bought a poster for our set and I left it at home.
[00:59.460 --> 00:59.980]  Oh, that's cool.
[01:00.440 --> 01:01.040]  Emily's not here.
[01:01.380 --> 01:01.740]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02.120 --> 01:04.760]  Eric Bedore, Geoff Ramsey, Emily is usually here.
[01:04.840 --> 01:05.720]  She'll be here a little late today.
[01:05.840 --> 01:08.100]  She's flying in from Dallas right now.
[01:08.260 --> 01:08.620]  In a car.
[01:08.780 --> 01:09.080]  She's driving.
[01:09.840 --> 01:11.000]  Driving in from Dallas right now.
[01:11.380 --> 01:12.540]  So she'll be joining us a little bit late.
[01:12.920 --> 01:16.080]  Goddammit, Eric, I'm mad because I wanted to put this poster up.
[01:16.120 --> 01:17.120]  I was really excited about it.
[01:17.300 --> 01:20.280]  It's very Break Show-ish and I think you're going to love it.
[01:20.600 --> 01:26.880]  And then I had a new segment I wanted to debut this week called Common Thread and I was missing one piece that I thought I had that I couldn't find.
[01:26.960 --> 01:27.380]  The thread?
[01:28.020 --> 01:28.320]  Yeah.
[01:28.460 --> 01:28.680]  Okay.
[01:28.840 --> 01:30.320]  It's just common right now.
[01:30.320 --> 01:30.440]  Okay.
[01:30.660 --> 01:32.240]  And I don't know what to do.
[01:32.980 --> 01:37.740]  So that'll debut next week, but then once we get that in the works, I think it'll be something that we do pretty often.
[01:37.820 --> 01:39.120]  You want to tease what we have today?
[01:39.300 --> 01:40.900]  Yeah, we have a lot to tease today.
[01:41.020 --> 01:41.240]  Okay.
[01:41.420 --> 01:43.200]  We've got some viewer mail.
[01:43.820 --> 01:47.420]  We've got, oh, this is cool.
[01:48.560 --> 01:49.280]  Decision 92.
[01:49.800 --> 01:50.220]  That's right.
[01:50.720 --> 01:57.700]  I got us two whole boxes of cards from the 1992 presidential election.
[01:57.720 --> 01:59.520]  I want Ross Perot auto on card.
[01:59.520 --> 02:01.440]  My favorite is the candidates.
[02:02.120 --> 02:04.100]  Special subset on billionaire Ross Perot.
[02:04.220 --> 02:05.760]  And then here's the other highlight.
[02:05.860 --> 02:06.400]  The issues.
[02:06.660 --> 02:07.020]  Healthcare.
[02:07.440 --> 02:07.960]  Pro-choice.
[02:08.320 --> 02:09.020]  Pro-life.
[02:09.780 --> 02:11.000]  Those are all the issues.
[02:11.280 --> 02:11.920]  Those are all the issues.
[02:12.020 --> 02:12.580]  Still the issues.
[02:13.360 --> 02:18.100]  In addition to that, we've got the Summer of 98 yearbook that was given to us at RTX.
[02:18.740 --> 02:24.300]  That is a piece of merchandise, not merchandise, lore there.
[02:24.420 --> 02:25.260]  You want to buy this?
[02:27.100 --> 02:31.680]  Everyone did such a good job putting their childhood pictures from 1998 in it.
[02:31.760 --> 02:32.540]  Do you want to buy this?
[02:32.740 --> 02:32.840]  No.
[02:32.920 --> 02:33.700]  It's not for sale.
[02:33.940 --> 02:34.560]  We're not selling it.
[02:35.420 --> 02:36.500]  This is a great book, though.
[02:36.700 --> 02:40.940]  This has like autographs from everyone, pictures and blurbs from people from 98.
[02:41.440 --> 02:42.120]  And this is great.
[02:42.340 --> 02:43.020]  This is really cool.
[02:43.100 --> 02:45.600]  Cool fans putting something together really awesome.
[02:45.660 --> 02:46.940]  It's one of the neatest things.
[02:47.300 --> 02:48.580]  This will live on the set.
[02:48.680 --> 02:51.300]  So happy it's going to live on the set as we...
[02:51.300 --> 02:54.820]  Oh, we're working on some stuff behind the scenes, so we're going to be formalizing our set a little bit more.
[02:54.820 --> 02:56.540]  So we can kind of build it out better.
[02:56.720 --> 03:04.540]  One of the coolest, definitely one of the coolest things, the Face community continues to have regulation listeners and comment leavers.
[03:04.760 --> 03:07.540]  They continue to be the most phenomenal in all ways.
[03:08.660 --> 03:18.240]  From the summer of 98 yearbook that they lovingly crafted and put together to stuff like these amazing Glurper cups inspired by...
[03:18.240 --> 03:18.500]  Fish Face.
[03:18.520 --> 03:19.100]  But not official.
[03:19.440 --> 03:19.840]  The Gruper.
[03:19.840 --> 03:23.100]  To two albums, I think they made or three now.
[03:23.720 --> 03:26.000]  Multiple Christmas albums, Valentine's Day albums.
[03:26.500 --> 03:27.480]  They're just phenomenally talented.
[03:27.500 --> 03:30.240]  Speaking of albums, we have a playlist that we just released.
[03:30.320 --> 03:31.720]  The Ultimate Playlist of 98.
[03:32.040 --> 03:34.260]  You can go watch that on Rooster Teeth or on YouTube.
[03:34.700 --> 03:39.820]  So that's going through making a playlist and then we release the playlist and it's across all platforms.
[03:40.040 --> 03:40.980]  Smash success.
[03:41.300 --> 03:41.420]  Yeah.
[03:41.680 --> 03:42.780]  Hit is what I heard.
[03:43.020 --> 03:43.740]  It's a hit.
[03:43.800 --> 03:44.440]  Everyone liked it.
[03:44.780 --> 03:45.540]  Left and right.
[03:46.380 --> 03:47.880]  Also, I got some of this.
[03:48.120 --> 03:49.540]  Lorikana, everybody's talking about.
[03:49.700 --> 03:53.620]  So I've been tracking it down all over the fucking United States to get this shit.
[03:53.780 --> 03:56.420]  I don't know anything about it, but we'll open it up and see what's up.
[03:57.140 --> 03:57.520]  And...
[03:57.520 --> 03:57.700]  Oh!
[03:59.100 --> 04:03.260]  What better place to start, Eric, than with our old pal, the Pac-Sac.
[04:03.700 --> 04:04.440]  Pac-Sac.
[04:04.720 --> 04:07.680]  Somebody gave me a Snoopy grade 10 PSA card at RTX.
[04:07.940 --> 04:08.680]  I just want to point that out.
[04:08.820 --> 04:09.700]  It lives on the set now.
[04:09.740 --> 04:10.480]  I'm pretty happy about it.
[04:11.160 --> 04:13.200]  The Pac-Sac has granted us ALF today.
[04:13.880 --> 04:14.640]  Oh, cool!
[04:14.640 --> 04:21.360]  I think we are maybe the only people that was alive when ALF was on TV that's in the studio right now.
[04:21.640 --> 04:22.460]  Mike's in the back.
[04:22.500 --> 04:22.980]  Mike's in the back.
[04:23.480 --> 04:28.760]  My favorite ALF fact is that Cousin Willie got busted smoking crack in his underwear with dudes.
[04:29.000 --> 04:30.300]  But nobody else remembers that.
[04:30.400 --> 04:31.240]  All right, here we go.
[04:31.420 --> 04:34.600]  I was so hungry, I ate the first chapter of this book.
[04:35.180 --> 04:36.000]  ALF liked to eat.
[04:36.360 --> 04:36.880]  He's an eater.
[04:36.900 --> 04:37.520]  Yeah, but he ate cats.
[04:37.620 --> 04:38.560]  He ate cats and books.
[04:38.660 --> 04:39.560]  I remember reading books.
[04:39.700 --> 04:39.840]  Yeah.
[04:39.840 --> 04:41.420]  A hair dryer.
[04:41.640 --> 04:43.840]  I thought it was a bagpipe that went berserk.
[04:45.920 --> 04:46.880]  These suck.
[04:46.960 --> 04:47.920]  He's not sick.
[04:48.240 --> 04:50.780]  He just needs to chase the cat for a while.
[04:50.820 --> 04:52.080]  This isn't good.
[04:52.220 --> 04:53.160]  These aren't good.
[04:53.240 --> 04:54.220]  Are these jokes?
[04:54.660 --> 04:55.080]  Yeah, dude.
[04:55.120 --> 04:56.660]  It's as funny as ALF probably was.
[04:58.020 --> 04:59.340]  What can I tell you?
[04:59.500 --> 05:01.740]  The girl who sold me this shirt was very cute.
[05:01.820 --> 05:07.860]  Okay, that is a live look picture of my friend Robbie.
[05:08.140 --> 05:09.120]  That's just him.
[05:09.120 --> 05:10.540]  That's just my buddy Robbie.
[05:10.760 --> 05:13.200]  I never realized how big ALF's paws are.
[05:13.920 --> 05:15.580]  He's going to be a big alien someday.
[05:15.820 --> 05:16.140]  Yeah, someday.
[05:16.380 --> 05:17.560]  He's got big ALF baby paws.
[05:18.200 --> 05:19.220]  Oh, here's a sticker.
[05:19.780 --> 05:20.500]  ALF sticker.
[05:20.680 --> 05:21.620]  It's that same photo.
[05:22.040 --> 05:22.720]  That's pretty cool.
[05:22.860 --> 05:23.700]  We can put that on something.
[05:23.820 --> 05:23.920]  Yeah.
[05:24.220 --> 05:26.580]  And then here's a Booyah Baseball.
[05:27.880 --> 05:30.320]  Bandorf Yesman Chuck, the Chuck or Stang.
[05:30.780 --> 05:31.860]  Stang is a good last name.
[05:31.880 --> 05:32.560]  Yeah, it's going, yeah.
[05:32.780 --> 05:33.380]  Chuck Stang.
[05:33.620 --> 05:34.940]  He's a right boardwheeler.
[05:35.200 --> 05:36.140]  I don't know what the fuck that means.
[05:36.260 --> 05:37.000]  All right, there you go.
[05:37.000 --> 05:38.600]  Thank you for that, Pac-Sac.
[05:39.380 --> 05:40.580]  Okay, before we go any further,
[05:41.400 --> 05:42.640]  the thing we've been doing every week
[05:42.640 --> 05:44.220]  that the audience seems to really respond to,
[05:45.640 --> 05:47.720]  is I take the hits from the previous week.
[05:47.740 --> 05:48.120]  Oh, that's right.
[05:48.140 --> 05:49.640]  And then I price them and I go over them
[05:49.640 --> 05:50.360]  and I show you what they're worth.
[05:50.440 --> 05:51.560]  So I have last week's hits right here.
[05:51.580 --> 05:52.160]  Did you have those?
[05:52.440 --> 05:53.360]  Yeah, or two weeks ago.
[05:53.640 --> 05:54.000]  Two weeks ago.
[05:54.320 --> 05:55.540]  So let's see what we've got.
[05:55.940 --> 05:57.760]  Everybody remembers one of the first cards we pulled,
[05:57.860 --> 06:00.360]  the Drew Holiday Gold Shimmer Monopoly card.
[06:00.700 --> 06:01.020]  Monopoly.
[06:01.340 --> 06:01.980]  That's a $5.
[06:02.460 --> 06:03.140]  Hey, all right.
[06:04.480 --> 06:06.780]  How about this Hayley Cavender Auto to $99?
[06:06.780 --> 06:07.780]  Mm-hmm.
[06:08.400 --> 06:09.280]  What do you think that one's worth?
[06:09.540 --> 06:09.940]  $13.
[06:10.180 --> 06:10.580]  $28.
[06:10.800 --> 06:12.240]  Hey, I was about halfway there.
[06:12.760 --> 06:14.120]  And the way, just for the record,
[06:14.180 --> 06:15.200]  the way I find these values
[06:15.200 --> 06:17.180]  is I search eBay for sold items.
[06:17.600 --> 06:19.260]  And so I see what they actually sold for.
[06:20.000 --> 06:21.680]  And if a bunch of them sold,
[06:21.740 --> 06:23.080]  I try to find the medium price in between.
[06:23.520 --> 06:24.940]  Okay, we got a Porzingis,
[06:25.420 --> 06:27.920]  a World Traveler's Recon Parallel.
[06:27.960 --> 06:29.800]  It's actually worth $4 for inserts.
[06:30.040 --> 06:30.240]  All right.
[06:31.000 --> 06:33.120]  Then we have this Tyrese Halliburton,
[06:33.120 --> 06:34.520]  number to 99.
[06:34.920 --> 06:35.140]  Mm-hmm.
[06:35.140 --> 06:36.480]  Number to 99, yeah.
[06:36.820 --> 06:38.140]  That's gonna run you about $4.
[06:38.600 --> 06:38.760]  Okay.
[06:39.620 --> 06:43.540]  Here we have a Future Legends Keegan Murray insert recon card.
[06:43.660 --> 06:46.240]  That's a, ooh, that's his rookie, Keegan Murray.
[06:46.540 --> 06:47.860]  Hot prospect, $3.
[06:48.560 --> 06:49.500]  He's not a hot prospect.
[06:49.560 --> 06:49.920]  Hot prospect.
[06:50.440 --> 06:54.560]  Here we have a autograph of Jabari Walker to $149.
[06:54.660 --> 06:54.860]  Uh-huh.
[06:55.260 --> 06:56.420]  Also not a hot prospect.
[06:56.640 --> 06:58.280]  That'll net you $8.
[06:59.360 --> 07:00.420]  And here's a little bit interesting.
[07:00.520 --> 07:01.420]  I did a little extra work on this one.
[07:01.640 --> 07:02.520]  Here's a LeBron base.
[07:02.520 --> 07:05.420]  Now, I threw this in here because I want to talk a little bit about LeBron.
[07:05.620 --> 07:09.900]  LeBron's one of the few players that maintains a value outside of his rookie class.
[07:10.680 --> 07:13.000]  So all of his cards are worth more than common cards.
[07:13.320 --> 07:13.360]  Okay.
[07:13.480 --> 07:17.240]  So, for instance, this card, $3, which is about as much as some of these rookies, right?
[07:17.760 --> 07:19.340]  But here's where I did a little bit of extra work for you.
[07:19.420 --> 07:20.540]  So this is the base card, Eric.
[07:20.620 --> 07:21.240]  It's worth $3.
[07:21.460 --> 07:24.560]  If this was numbered to 99, it would be worth $10.
[07:24.880 --> 07:28.020]  If it was numbered to 49, it would be worth $30.
[07:28.480 --> 07:31.140]  If it was numbered to 10, it would be worth $180.
[07:31.140 --> 07:32.240]  Wow, really?
[07:32.320 --> 07:35.940]  And if it was numbered to 5, it would run you about $350.
[07:36.360 --> 07:36.620]  Wow.
[07:36.840 --> 07:36.980]  Yeah.
[07:37.560 --> 07:40.580]  So that gives you an idea of how rarity impacts value.
[07:40.720 --> 07:46.680]  So from $3 to $350, just based on how rare it is.
[07:46.740 --> 07:47.260]  What do you got, LeBron?
[07:49.080 --> 07:49.880]  Oh, also...
[07:51.320 --> 07:52.800]  Nah, fuck, I took that one out.
[07:52.860 --> 07:53.320]  All right, Chet.
[07:53.580 --> 07:56.100]  Chet Holmgren, last year's big rookie.
[07:56.300 --> 07:57.380]  He got hurt at the beginning of the season.
[07:57.380 --> 08:01.940]  He got hurt before the season started and never suited up.
[08:02.080 --> 08:04.280]  Hasn't played a second of NBA so far.
[08:04.380 --> 08:05.480]  That's $3 now.
[08:05.620 --> 08:07.480]  He's at a low right now.
[08:07.700 --> 08:09.820]  You know, aren't as excited about him because of Wimby.
[08:10.340 --> 08:10.880]  Here we go.
[08:10.980 --> 08:11.660]  Here's Katelyn Clark.
[08:11.880 --> 08:13.480]  Bowman, a U refractor.
[08:13.760 --> 08:14.020]  $10.
[08:14.580 --> 08:15.060]  Hey, all right.
[08:15.240 --> 08:17.800]  Katelyn Clark pulling in the big bucks.
[08:18.460 --> 08:20.240]  Here's a Mike Trout base card.
[08:20.340 --> 08:21.360]  He's kind of like LeBron.
[08:21.560 --> 08:23.260]  This is 2017 tops.
[08:23.460 --> 08:24.040]  That's $3.
[08:24.940 --> 08:25.920]  Then this is interesting.
[08:25.920 --> 08:28.720]  We have Joe Carter, Barry Bombs, 1992 tops All-Stars.
[08:28.980 --> 08:30.180]  $30 at a PSA 10.
[08:30.500 --> 08:30.580]  Cool.
[08:31.100 --> 08:34.240]  Got our Mike Piazza, Carlos Delgado rookie.
[08:35.340 --> 08:36.400]  Graded PSA 10.
[08:36.560 --> 08:38.000]  That's a $65 card.
[08:38.200 --> 08:38.460]  Okay.
[08:39.180 --> 08:42.220]  And here's everybody's favorite, Otis Relic.
[08:42.980 --> 08:44.680]  I did a lot of searching for Otis.
[08:45.600 --> 08:49.220]  Not only can I not find this card, I can't find anything close to what's sold.
[08:49.360 --> 08:50.660]  I'm going to guess it's about $15.
[08:51.120 --> 08:51.640]  There you go.
[08:51.760 --> 08:55.140]  So that's the hits from last week and that's how much they were all worth.
[08:55.140 --> 08:56.680]  That's a lot of money that we won't do anything with.
[08:56.880 --> 09:01.800]  Yeah, it's a lot of money that's just going to sit there and not turn into actual money.
[09:01.960 --> 09:02.140]  Yeah.
[09:03.320 --> 09:04.920]  Let's open up some cards, though.
[09:05.000 --> 09:05.620]  I don't know if you insist.
[09:06.060 --> 09:08.620]  Why don't we do a little 1999 tops and see if we can get ourselves a Zim.
[09:08.700 --> 09:09.500]  Is that a Zim, maybe?
[09:09.720 --> 09:10.660]  Yeah, it's a maybe Zim.
[09:10.760 --> 09:12.760]  We're always looking for Don Zimmer here, as you know.
[09:13.160 --> 09:15.320]  We have him in bear form here on the set.
[09:15.520 --> 09:17.920]  Not only do we have him in bear form.
[09:18.320 --> 09:19.660]  We've had him in bear form for years.
[09:19.760 --> 09:20.200]  Years now.
[09:20.200 --> 09:28.340]  We've had him in bear form a lot longer than certain other Internet properties who just discovered the Zim bear and decided to put it in content today.
[09:28.400 --> 09:31.980]  As if they invented or discovered Don Zimmer's fucking Zim bear.
[09:32.360 --> 09:33.800]  Looking at you, GMM.
[09:33.920 --> 09:34.060]  Yeah.
[09:34.160 --> 09:34.960]  Billy Hatcher.
[09:36.380 --> 09:38.500]  Don Zimmer is the gift that everybody should enjoy.
[09:38.740 --> 09:44.720]  Billy Hatcher is the name of a Nintendo 64 game and you're thinking, oh, like it sounds like...
[09:44.720 --> 09:44.840]  No.
[09:45.280 --> 09:47.440]  Billy Hatcher is the name of a Nintendo 64 game.
[09:47.500 --> 09:47.860]  Is it really?
[09:48.620 --> 09:50.840]  Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg or something like that?
[09:51.280 --> 09:51.400]  Yeah.
[09:51.880 --> 09:52.780]  Billy... name is a game.
[09:52.840 --> 09:53.520]  Name is a game.
[09:54.480 --> 09:55.200]  Scott Bankhead.
[09:58.060 --> 09:58.780]  Steve Ellsworth.
[09:59.760 --> 10:00.860]  Oh, here we got Geoff Treadway.
[10:01.920 --> 10:02.280]  Okay.
[10:02.460 --> 10:06.260]  Isn't that who... aren't those the Treadway... isn't that the people that created Jason Bourne?
[10:06.260 --> 10:10.540]  No, it's... Treadway is like... it's like a park... you can't park on a driveway and you can't drive on a parkway.
[10:10.680 --> 10:12.120]  You can't tread on... yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:14.100 --> 10:14.820]  Robbie Thompson.
[10:15.520 --> 10:16.540]  He's popping a squat.
[10:17.380 --> 10:18.040]  Chet Lemon.
[10:18.220 --> 10:18.840]  Name is a food.
[10:19.000 --> 10:20.240]  Bad name is a food right there.
[10:20.320 --> 10:20.980]  Yeah, we go.
[10:22.160 --> 10:23.480]  Jerry Don Gleaton.
[10:25.100 --> 10:25.760]  God damn.
[10:25.960 --> 10:27.600]  With that name, with that look?
[10:28.100 --> 10:28.920]  Hell yeah, baby.
[10:30.180 --> 10:31.500]  That's a serious man.
[10:31.540 --> 10:31.720]  Yeah.
[10:32.000 --> 10:32.820]  Living a serious life.
[10:32.920 --> 10:33.380]  Matt Williams.
[10:34.180 --> 10:35.300]  That's an all-time great Matt Williams.
[10:35.420 --> 10:36.080]  Everybody loves Matt Williams.
[10:36.540 --> 10:37.520]  Willie Upshaw.
[10:38.620 --> 10:38.980]  He...
[10:40.040 --> 10:40.740]  It was right there.
[10:41.900 --> 10:42.200]  I don't know.
[10:42.220 --> 10:43.660]  I was going to make a joke, but I didn't have one.
[10:43.700 --> 10:43.820]  Great.
[10:43.820 --> 10:44.600]  Record breaker.
[10:44.820 --> 10:46.660]  That looks like my man Wade Boggs.
[10:47.220 --> 10:48.180]  Steve Avery.
[10:48.320 --> 10:49.260]  Number one draft pick.
[10:49.480 --> 10:50.760]  Look at him playing catch with himself.
[10:50.960 --> 10:51.720]  He didn't have a pad.
[10:51.780 --> 10:53.660]  Already going into junior year of high school.
[10:53.820 --> 10:54.260]  Looking great.
[10:55.480 --> 10:56.400]  Jim Abbott.
[10:56.720 --> 10:57.660]  I love Jim Abbott.
[10:58.360 --> 10:59.080]  Manny Trillo.
[11:00.820 --> 11:01.780]  Johnny Castillo.
[11:02.180 --> 11:02.900]  Or Costello, sorry.
[11:03.420 --> 11:04.540]  And then John Smiley.
[11:04.660 --> 11:06.660]  Name is the thing he's doing.
[11:07.640 --> 11:09.240]  Is he doing a Smiley?
[11:09.460 --> 11:10.160]  I think he's trying.
[11:10.260 --> 11:11.180]  I think he's trying.
[11:11.620 --> 11:12.040]  Man.
[11:13.180 --> 11:13.500]  Oof.
[11:14.440 --> 11:16.520]  This is a rough look, bud.
[11:16.640 --> 11:17.300]  It was effort.
[11:18.380 --> 11:19.480]  Let's see what else we got here.
[11:20.380 --> 11:22.660]  You have to save Dallas for if Emily gets here.
[11:22.740 --> 11:23.300]  I know, I know.
[11:23.480 --> 11:25.760]  Because you're going to open it for me and I'm not going to know what the fuck is going on.
[11:25.880 --> 11:26.480]  I'm going to do something for you.
[11:26.560 --> 11:28.400]  I'm going to open a 2022 Revolution.
[11:28.700 --> 11:29.180]  Oh, wow.
[11:29.240 --> 11:29.860]  Debut edition.
[11:29.960 --> 11:30.540]  Five cards.
[11:30.640 --> 11:31.300]  This is WWE.
[11:31.800 --> 11:32.200]  It is.
[11:32.260 --> 11:33.960]  Why did you pay $11, man?
[11:34.180 --> 11:34.500]  Wow.
[11:34.800 --> 11:37.700]  Because I wanted to delight you with what these fucking five cards are.
[11:37.700 --> 11:38.720]  I'm happy about it.
[11:38.920 --> 11:40.520]  I really want to see the AEW cards.
[11:40.680 --> 11:41.120]  Some more of those.
[11:41.120 --> 11:41.940]  Those are cool.
[11:42.220 --> 11:42.960]  All right.
[11:43.060 --> 11:43.940]  I don't know if I have them.
[11:44.120 --> 11:44.880]  Nah, you're good.
[11:45.120 --> 11:45.520]  All right, let's see.
[11:45.720 --> 11:48.480]  Okay, here we got a Von Wagner rookie.
[11:48.600 --> 11:50.400]  Yeah, come Tuesday, this guy's taking you out, baby.
[11:50.600 --> 11:51.040]  Hell yeah.
[11:51.260 --> 11:51.460]  Really?
[11:51.660 --> 11:52.340]  Yeah, that's what he is.
[11:52.340 --> 11:53.380]  He's taking out Andre Chase.
[11:54.820 --> 11:55.800]  Here we go.
[11:57.000 --> 11:57.800]  Sami Zayn?
[11:57.860 --> 11:58.800]  Sami Zayn.
[11:59.720 --> 12:02.160]  Former independent professional wrestler El Generico.
[12:02.820 --> 12:05.740]  I saw him wrestle in a Jewish community center in like 2004.
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.660]  If I were that dude, I would change my name to Sami N. Zayn.
[12:09.920 --> 12:10.300]  Oh.
[12:10.300 --> 12:11.390]  And I would be like, I'm in Zayn!
[12:12.160 --> 12:13.460]  He wrestled Johnny Knoxville at WrestleMania.
[12:13.900 --> 12:14.260]  Did he win?
[12:15.040 --> 12:15.880]  Johnny Knoxville won.
[12:16.320 --> 12:18.180]  They trapped Sami Zayn in a giant mousetrap.
[12:18.840 --> 12:19.220]  Oh.
[12:19.420 --> 12:22.560]  It was like a bunch of wacky stuff, like the big hand from Jackass.
[12:23.100 --> 12:25.100]  Wee Man came in and scoop slammed Sami Zayn.
[12:25.160 --> 12:25.720]  It was fucking great.
[12:25.840 --> 12:27.100]  It was like a lot of fun.
[12:29.620 --> 12:30.380]  Ilja Dragunov.
[12:30.440 --> 12:31.320]  Ilja Dragunov.
[12:31.460 --> 12:32.400]  He's very good.
[12:32.580 --> 12:33.840]  He's uber seizure.
[12:34.160 --> 12:36.660]  He's a big kind of Russian guy.
[12:36.840 --> 12:37.680]  Uber seizure?
[12:37.860 --> 12:38.300]  Uber seizure.
[12:38.600 --> 12:39.060]  What does that mean?
[12:39.060 --> 12:40.070]  He's just like a berserker.
[12:40.840 --> 12:41.420]  Oh shit.
[12:41.540 --> 12:42.380]  I think that's Emily.
[12:42.660 --> 12:42.720]  Yeah.
[12:42.940 --> 12:43.320]  Showing up.
[12:44.060 --> 12:46.460]  Okay, next on the list we have...
[12:48.240 --> 12:48.920]  Cora Jade.
[12:49.360 --> 12:49.700]  Oh.
[12:50.040 --> 12:50.620]  She's a skater.
[12:50.820 --> 12:55.980]  She has a little penny board and she would skate down to the ring and then not use the board for anything else.
[12:56.040 --> 12:56.780]  It was always very funny.
[12:56.920 --> 12:59.620]  It was just like, you have the penny board, just hit somebody with it.
[12:59.800 --> 12:59.980]  Yeah.
[13:00.080 --> 13:00.980]  But never hit anybody with the board.
[13:00.980 --> 13:01.580]  No, not really.
[13:02.020 --> 13:04.140]  And now she stopped and now she has like a bat or something.
[13:04.180 --> 13:04.500]  I don't know.
[13:04.740 --> 13:05.640]  Does she hit people with the bat?
[13:05.760 --> 13:06.540]  Yes, I think so.
[13:06.880 --> 13:07.700]  She doesn't ride it down to the ring?
[13:07.700 --> 13:09.860]  Yeah, no, she doesn't ride the bat down to the ring.
[13:09.960 --> 13:10.940]  Fractal parallel there.
[13:11.240 --> 13:11.540]  That's pretty cool.
[13:11.540 --> 13:12.500]  That's her rookie card, by the way.
[13:12.540 --> 13:16.460]  Well, she's, I think, pretty young, so I think everything she does is a rookie card.
[13:17.540 --> 13:17.900]  RKBro.
[13:18.020 --> 13:27.720]  Hey, it is Randy Orton and Matt Riddle, who was a UFC guy and then got fired because he wouldn't stop smoking weed.
[13:28.260 --> 13:28.740]  Oh, really?
[13:28.840 --> 13:29.800]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:29.800 --> 13:30.800]  So he's a WWE guy.
[13:30.900 --> 13:34.340]  So if you smoke too much weed in the UFC, you get to be a wrestler.
[13:34.700 --> 13:34.960]  Yeah.
[13:35.640 --> 13:36.360]  Yeah, definitely.
[13:36.360 --> 13:37.180]  Interesting career path.
[13:37.180 --> 13:37.820]  Hey, Emily's here.
[13:37.880 --> 13:38.200]  Hey.
[13:38.220 --> 13:38.500]  Hi.
[13:38.760 --> 13:40.200]  I made it straight in from Dallas.
[13:41.220 --> 13:42.500]  You flew in via car.
[13:42.660 --> 13:43.140]  I did.
[13:43.420 --> 13:44.560]  I flew down I-35.
[13:44.920 --> 13:45.500]  That's pretty cool.
[13:45.640 --> 13:45.840]  Yeah.
[13:46.000 --> 13:46.580]  Oh, great.
[13:46.920 --> 13:47.660]  What is it?
[13:47.680 --> 13:48.520]  To welcome you.
[13:48.740 --> 13:49.020]  Uh-huh.
[13:49.580 --> 13:52.960]  I was listening to live on racertooth.com in the car.
[13:53.100 --> 13:53.140]  Wow.
[13:53.380 --> 13:53.920]  What a plug.
[13:53.960 --> 13:54.700]  So I, uh...
[13:54.700 --> 13:55.120]  That's great.
[13:56.320 --> 13:57.420]  Oh, yay, Dallas.
[13:57.720 --> 13:58.300]  I was just there.
[13:58.400 --> 13:59.200]  There was a Ewing Avenue.
[13:59.200 --> 14:00.500]  I was just there.
[14:00.600 --> 14:01.200]  I was just there.
[14:01.480 --> 14:02.700]  We didn't go to South Fork, though.
[14:02.720 --> 14:04.520]  I have to go with Geoff and I have to earn it.
[14:04.520 --> 14:06.660]  I have to get to the end of the series.
[14:06.680 --> 14:07.620]  I have to watch it all.
[14:08.560 --> 14:10.500]  And we just started season six.
[14:10.600 --> 14:11.560]  I texted Geoff this morning.
[14:11.660 --> 14:13.100]  I said, Sue Ellen ruined her hair.
[14:13.540 --> 14:13.940]  Horrible.
[14:14.100 --> 14:15.180]  How many seasons are there?
[14:15.260 --> 14:15.520]  Twelve.
[14:16.200 --> 14:16.600]  What?!
[14:16.600 --> 14:16.760]  Yeah.
[14:16.920 --> 14:18.660]  And each season has like 30 episodes.
[14:18.680 --> 14:19.020]  Oh!
[14:19.920 --> 14:20.820]  And it's amazing.
[14:22.220 --> 14:26.360]  And the cliffhanger of season five was that Cliff Barnes tried to kill himself.
[14:26.560 --> 14:27.160]  And so he's in the hospital.
[14:27.280 --> 14:28.240]  Whether he's gonna live or die.
[14:29.000 --> 14:29.800]  The whole thing.
[14:29.900 --> 14:31.460]  And then Lucy...
[14:31.460 --> 14:32.260]  Did I tell you about Lucy?
[14:32.440 --> 14:32.860]  She's pregnant.
[14:32.860 --> 14:33.620]  Oh yeah, she's pregnant.
[14:33.920 --> 14:35.890]  She was abducted and like...
[14:37.380 --> 14:37.760]  Assaulted?
[14:38.580 --> 14:38.960]  Whoops.
[14:39.680 --> 14:40.880]  By this piece of shit.
[14:40.980 --> 14:42.440]  And then she just found out that she's pregnant.
[14:42.560 --> 14:43.360]  So she doesn't know what to do.
[14:44.860 --> 14:45.240]  And...
[14:45.240 --> 14:46.400]  How are Pamela and Bobby?
[14:46.800 --> 14:47.760]  The baby's theirs.
[14:48.220 --> 14:48.640]  Oh, good.
[14:48.640 --> 14:49.220]  The baby is theirs.
[14:49.340 --> 14:49.800]  They didn't...
[14:49.800 --> 14:51.020]  It's not JR's baby.
[14:51.160 --> 14:52.880]  It's the other guy that died.
[14:53.640 --> 14:54.020]  Geoff...
[14:54.020 --> 14:54.540]  Whatever his name is.
[14:54.560 --> 14:54.860]  Faraday.
[14:54.940 --> 14:55.240]  Faraday.
[14:55.320 --> 14:55.760]  Geoff Faraday.
[14:55.880 --> 14:58.680]  Out of season six, do you think it holds strong through the next six seasons?
[14:59.320 --> 15:00.840]  Supposedly it holds strong through about nine.
[15:00.840 --> 15:02.860]  And then it falls off a cliff.
[15:02.960 --> 15:03.460]  So we'll see.
[15:03.660 --> 15:05.040]  There's Bobby Ewing himself.
[15:05.160 --> 15:05.900]  Step-by-step dad.
[15:05.900 --> 15:06.480]  There he is.
[15:06.520 --> 15:07.580]  Hanging out in the drinking room.
[15:07.880 --> 15:09.640]  That's where they drink together as a family every night.
[15:09.720 --> 15:10.500]  Before they have dinner.
[15:11.320 --> 15:12.120]  That's awesome.
[15:12.360 --> 15:12.900]  There's JR.
[15:12.940 --> 15:14.120]  We've had this car!
[15:14.280 --> 15:14.380]  Yeah.
[15:14.600 --> 15:15.980]  We specifically had this car.
[15:16.080 --> 15:17.040]  That was when they...
[15:17.040 --> 15:17.740]  That means we can trade it.
[15:17.740 --> 15:19.580]  Went camping and they got shot at.
[15:19.840 --> 15:20.980]  And Zach almost died.
[15:21.100 --> 15:22.380]  And JR did nothing to help.
[15:22.640 --> 15:23.040]  Useless.
[15:23.260 --> 15:24.100]  Wore a safari outfit.
[15:24.560 --> 15:26.280]  There's Cliff Barnes himself right there.
[15:26.480 --> 15:28.000]  Too greedy for his own good.
[15:28.040 --> 15:29.420]  Yeah, I used to love him.
[15:29.580 --> 15:29.760]  Come on, Cliff.
[15:29.760 --> 15:30.380]  But he got a little greedy.
[15:30.380 --> 15:31.740]  He's Pamela's brother too.
[15:31.820 --> 15:33.740]  Hoisted by his own petard.
[15:33.940 --> 15:34.680]  Speaking of Pamela.
[15:34.980 --> 15:35.480]  There's Pamela.
[15:35.620 --> 15:36.400]  Brother and sister right there.
[15:36.520 --> 15:37.040]  Pamela and Cliff.
[15:37.080 --> 15:38.800]  Yeah, that's Pamela when she had a bad haircut.
[15:39.120 --> 15:39.380]  Right.
[15:39.520 --> 15:40.840]  While Cliff is checking his mail.
[15:41.040 --> 15:41.200]  Yeah.
[15:41.360 --> 15:42.620]  See if anything comes in for him.
[15:42.660 --> 15:43.660]  This show rips.
[15:44.540 --> 15:45.900]  There's Pamela with her bad haircut.
[15:46.120 --> 15:46.420]  Again.
[15:46.720 --> 15:47.260]  Pamela and Bobby.
[15:47.380 --> 15:48.360]  She's probably being like,
[15:48.420 --> 15:49.720]  but Bobby, I have to go to work.
[15:49.740 --> 15:50.200]  And he's like,
[15:50.220 --> 15:51.140]  why would you go to work?
[15:51.160 --> 15:51.680]  You have money.
[15:51.740 --> 15:52.220]  Just stay here.
[15:52.240 --> 15:52.620]  And she's like,
[15:52.640 --> 15:54.260]  there's more than just like planning parties.
[15:54.800 --> 15:54.980]  Yeah.
[15:55.120 --> 15:55.960]  The 80s were wild times.
[15:55.960 --> 15:57.880]  And then he bought her a red convertible.
[15:57.980 --> 15:58.360]  Because he's like,
[15:58.360 --> 15:59.560]  well, you got to get to work somehow.
[15:59.960 --> 16:00.720]  So he got her a Porsche.
[16:00.980 --> 16:01.120]  Yeah.
[16:01.220 --> 16:01.320]  Right.
[16:01.720 --> 16:02.280]  There we go.
[16:02.380 --> 16:04.380]  There's Jock and Ellie Mae.
[16:04.460 --> 16:05.500]  It's so cool, too,
[16:05.600 --> 16:07.480]  because both of those actors in this shot
[16:07.480 --> 16:08.340]  are probably like 51.
[16:09.640 --> 16:10.160]  That's true.
[16:10.420 --> 16:11.780]  Actually, Jock, the dad,
[16:13.320 --> 16:16.000]  he dies not too long after this in real life.
[16:16.000 --> 16:17.540]  I remember you guys talking about that.
[16:17.720 --> 16:18.520]  I didn't fact check this,
[16:18.540 --> 16:19.540]  but someone told me that
[16:19.540 --> 16:21.200]  he may have been the original Marlboro Man.
[16:21.360 --> 16:22.280]  That might not be true.
[16:22.400 --> 16:23.100]  Someone told me that,
[16:23.140 --> 16:23.860]  but I didn't look it up.
[16:23.900 --> 16:25.100]  But I just remember that now.
[16:25.100 --> 16:25.960]  Oh, we should look into that.
[16:25.960 --> 16:27.140]  That's why he lived to be 62.
[16:27.860 --> 16:29.200]  He had brain cancer.
[16:29.460 --> 16:29.680]  Yeah.
[16:29.780 --> 16:30.520]  Oh, my God.
[16:30.860 --> 16:32.800]  He went down to South America
[16:32.800 --> 16:34.100]  to help the government.
[16:34.920 --> 16:35.760]  Teach them how to drill for oil.
[16:35.760 --> 16:36.780]  Teach them how to drill for oil.
[16:36.860 --> 16:37.020]  Yeah.
[16:37.260 --> 16:39.100]  And then his helicopter crashed
[16:39.100 --> 16:39.680]  between seasons.
[16:39.700 --> 16:40.520]  He went down there to see
[16:40.520 --> 16:41.620]  what Nicaragua was all about.
[16:41.780 --> 16:42.400]  And there's Lucy.
[16:42.400 --> 16:43.140]  Oh, there's Lucy.
[16:43.520 --> 16:44.600]  She's in trouble right now.
[16:44.980 --> 16:46.260]  Last season, in season five,
[16:46.320 --> 16:49.320]  she got abducted by this really shitty guy
[16:49.320 --> 16:50.820]  who was a photographer,
[16:51.360 --> 16:53.320]  and then her husband's a piece of shit,
[16:53.440 --> 16:54.160]  and he left her, too,
[16:54.200 --> 16:54.940]  and then she was abducted.
[16:55.020 --> 16:56.220]  And the family didn't even notice
[16:56.220 --> 16:56.960]  that she was gone.
[16:57.160 --> 16:59.020]  She was gone for, like, abducted
[16:59.020 --> 17:00.620]  for, like, three days,
[17:00.860 --> 17:01.940]  and then nobody noticed.
[17:02.140 --> 17:03.300]  Even right now with her, like,
[17:03.360 --> 17:04.380]  up in her room sad
[17:04.380 --> 17:05.600]  because she was abducted
[17:05.600 --> 17:07.400]  and, like, assaulted.
[17:07.720 --> 17:07.920]  Uh-huh.
[17:08.120 --> 17:08.800]  No one has...
[17:08.800 --> 17:09.660]  It's only been her friend
[17:09.660 --> 17:10.700]  that comes in to check on her.
[17:10.820 --> 17:11.260]  Nobody's like,
[17:11.300 --> 17:12.420]  Hey, Lucy, I haven't left your room
[17:12.420 --> 17:13.060]  in three days.
[17:13.760 --> 17:15.020]  Well, they have a lot going on.
[17:15.300 --> 17:15.620]  Yeah.
[17:15.780 --> 17:16.460]  There's a lot happening.
[17:16.600 --> 17:17.460]  Speaking of a lot going on,
[17:17.480 --> 17:18.400]  let's open up some mail.
[17:18.540 --> 17:18.760]  Okay.
[17:19.020 --> 17:19.960]  Let's see what we got here.
[17:20.060 --> 17:21.620]  We got two card packs in there.
[17:21.660 --> 17:22.000]  All right.
[17:22.020 --> 17:22.540]  There's no note.
[17:22.740 --> 17:23.040]  No note.
[17:23.040 --> 17:25.440]  I mean, it's from a place, but...
[17:25.440 --> 17:26.940]  Somebody sent us, uh,
[17:27.860 --> 17:29.180]  Tribe the intro.
[17:29.560 --> 17:30.920]  Whatever the fuck that is.
[17:30.960 --> 17:31.780]  So I'm telling you, man,
[17:31.800 --> 17:33.240]  I told you when we had the mail today,
[17:33.280 --> 17:34.020]  I told you what it was.
[17:34.140 --> 17:34.840]  I told you what was up.
[17:35.640 --> 17:36.600]  Let's open it up and see.
[17:36.860 --> 17:37.180]  Okay.
[17:37.400 --> 17:37.900]  What is Tribe?
[17:37.900 --> 17:40.400]  Is it, like, a game or a comic book
[17:40.400 --> 17:41.100]  I never heard of?
[17:41.120 --> 17:41.300]  Okay.
[17:42.900 --> 17:43.300]  Cool.
[17:43.760 --> 17:45.700]  Yeah, it looks like a comic book
[17:45.700 --> 17:46.640]  of some kind.
[17:47.060 --> 17:47.220]  Okay.
[17:47.240 --> 17:48.380]  See, there's a...
[17:48.380 --> 17:49.380]  Oh, there's just a whole panel.
[17:49.480 --> 17:50.660]  Well, the art style looks
[17:50.660 --> 17:52.540]  very Rob Liefeld.
[17:52.540 --> 17:53.260]  Yeah, boy!
[17:53.340 --> 17:54.040]  It looks like it's not.
[17:54.200 --> 17:54.740]  It's by somebody named Larry Strong.
[17:54.740 --> 17:56.520]  If you weren't alive in 1992
[17:56.520 --> 17:58.000]  but wanted to know what it was like,
[17:58.120 --> 17:58.600]  it's that.
[17:59.060 --> 17:59.320]  Yeah.
[17:59.460 --> 17:59.780]  It just...
[17:59.780 --> 18:01.220]  Everything looked like this
[18:01.220 --> 18:02.600]  or tried to look like this
[18:02.600 --> 18:03.720]  and none of it was good.
[18:03.960 --> 18:04.580]  It's like...
[18:04.580 --> 18:05.080]  It's like, here,
[18:05.140 --> 18:06.200]  we're gonna give you each panel
[18:06.200 --> 18:06.960]  from the comic book,
[18:07.020 --> 18:07.700]  but it's random,
[18:07.960 --> 18:08.960]  so you can't read it
[18:08.960 --> 18:09.980]  till you collect the whole thing.
[18:10.000 --> 18:10.940]  Everything was called
[18:10.940 --> 18:13.040]  The Max with Two X's.
[18:13.220 --> 18:13.640]  That's true.
[18:13.740 --> 18:14.460]  And that is...
[18:14.460 --> 18:15.860]  That's really kind of, like,
[18:15.860 --> 18:16.460]  how things went.
[18:16.660 --> 18:18.760]  And then Godzilla Superview.
[18:19.340 --> 18:20.560]  You know about the new Godzilla thing
[18:20.560 --> 18:21.240]  that's coming out?
[18:21.240 --> 18:21.520]  No.
[18:21.720 --> 18:22.940]  It's like Godzilla Minus One
[18:22.940 --> 18:23.400]  or something.
[18:23.800 --> 18:23.960]  What does that mean?
[18:24.280 --> 18:26.000]  I think it's like...
[18:26.000 --> 18:26.820]  I don't think it's like
[18:26.820 --> 18:27.540]  Godzilla, Godzilla.
[18:27.780 --> 18:29.020]  It's something like right before it.
[18:29.160 --> 18:30.240]  But, not to be outdone,
[18:32.160 --> 18:33.040]  Apple TV?
[18:33.260 --> 18:33.760]  I don't know what the fuck
[18:33.760 --> 18:35.540]  their paid subscription thing is.
[18:36.060 --> 18:37.780]  I saw a preview and I went,
[18:37.960 --> 18:39.140]  fucking Kurt Russell's in something.
[18:39.220 --> 18:39.480]  Hell yeah.
[18:39.540 --> 18:40.000]  It's Apple?
[18:40.080 --> 18:40.520]  That's cool.
[18:41.560 --> 18:43.140]  It's called, like, Monarch
[18:43.140 --> 18:43.660]  and it's like,
[18:43.760 --> 18:44.780]  this is John Goodman
[18:44.780 --> 18:47.060]  and he found all the monsters
[18:47.780 --> 18:48.660]  from Godzilla
[18:49.140 --> 18:50.700]  and Kurt Russell is in this thing
[18:50.700 --> 18:51.900]  where, like, Mothra is here
[18:51.900 --> 18:53.420]  and I just went...
[18:53.420 --> 18:54.600]  It's a TV show?
[18:54.700 --> 18:54.920]  What?
[18:55.060 --> 18:55.300]  Yeah.
[18:55.560 --> 18:56.860]  It gives a fuck!
[18:57.640 --> 18:58.960]  Put Kurt Russell in more stuff
[18:58.960 --> 19:00.520]  and don't make him fight Mothra
[19:00.520 --> 19:01.120]  or whatever.
[19:02.280 --> 19:03.640]  These cards are long.
[19:03.740 --> 19:04.980]  These are long cards.
[19:05.100 --> 19:05.780]  Here's Godzilla.
[19:06.020 --> 19:07.520]  Godzilla needs a pedicure.
[19:07.800 --> 19:08.820]  Is this from the movie?
[19:08.880 --> 19:09.060]  Yeah.
[19:09.440 --> 19:10.300]  Have you seen it?
[19:10.420 --> 19:11.500]  That's the Godzilla family.
[19:11.660 --> 19:12.340]  That's the baby Godzillas.
[19:12.620 --> 19:13.560]  This movie sucks.
[19:13.680 --> 19:14.960]  The only good thing that came out
[19:14.960 --> 19:18.760]  of this movie was...
[19:18.760 --> 19:19.360]  Matthew Broderick?
[19:19.360 --> 19:20.220]  Yeah, the cartoon one.
[19:20.460 --> 19:22.160]  The cartoon, which was fine.
[19:23.900 --> 19:26.020]  The cashmere cover thing
[19:26.020 --> 19:28.340]  that Diddy did with...
[19:28.340 --> 19:28.960]  Oh, right.
[19:29.780 --> 19:30.660]  That's 98, right?
[19:30.700 --> 19:31.140]  Summer of 98.
[19:31.180 --> 19:32.340]  And then also,
[19:32.600 --> 19:34.080]  the Taco Bell commercial
[19:34.080 --> 19:35.180]  where the Chihuahua goes,
[19:35.480 --> 19:37.380]  Here, lizard, lizard, lizard.
[19:40.220 --> 19:41.960]  Next package somebody sent us.
[19:42.020 --> 19:43.520]  Who's Roger Rabbit cards?
[19:43.780 --> 19:44.220]  Ooh.
[19:44.420 --> 19:45.040]  Who is Roger Rabbit?
[19:45.040 --> 19:46.620]  Would it be Who Framed Roger Rabbit?
[19:46.860 --> 19:48.460]  Who's Framed Roger Rabbit?
[19:49.460 --> 19:50.100]  Holy shit.
[19:51.040 --> 19:51.680]  Who is...
[19:51.680 --> 19:54.040]  Who the fuck is Roger Rabbit?
[19:54.680 --> 19:55.460]  Who's Roger Rabbit?
[19:55.460 --> 19:55.660]  Hey!
[19:57.440 --> 19:59.220]  You a Roger Rabbit fan, Emily,
[19:59.320 --> 19:59.860]  when you were a kid?
[20:00.500 --> 20:01.660]  We saw the movie.
[20:01.720 --> 20:02.940]  It was a little frantic for me,
[20:03.020 --> 20:04.220]  but we definitely watched it
[20:04.220 --> 20:04.980]  when we were younger, yeah.
[20:04.980 --> 20:06.000]  Because we're like the same age,
[20:06.040 --> 20:07.660]  and I remember being scared of the dip.
[20:08.040 --> 20:08.960]  It was a lot, yeah.
[20:09.060 --> 20:10.280]  It was just like a little,
[20:10.280 --> 20:10.780]  a little much.
[20:10.780 --> 20:12.260]  The dip was scary for me
[20:12.260 --> 20:12.680]  when I was in grade school.
[20:12.700 --> 20:13.820]  But then it was like the little shoe.
[20:13.940 --> 20:14.620]  It was so cute.
[20:15.040 --> 20:15.780]  I was scared,
[20:15.840 --> 20:16.660]  and I had to go to work later.
[20:16.660 --> 20:18.960]  I was working at the movie theater.
[20:19.180 --> 20:21.120]  All right, where's the rabbit at?
[20:21.240 --> 20:22.260]  That's not how you spell All Right.
[20:22.400 --> 20:23.280]  Bob Hoskins says.
[20:23.540 --> 20:25.160]  So All Right is the name of Geoff's podcast.
[20:25.520 --> 20:28.040]  Inside the club, in the club.
[20:28.600 --> 20:29.500]  Does everybody remember
[20:29.500 --> 20:31.060]  Love with the Proper Rabbit?
[20:31.540 --> 20:33.080]  I don't know what that means.
[20:34.360 --> 20:35.440]  Someone's tailing me.
[20:36.600 --> 20:37.420]  Then we have,
[20:37.680 --> 20:38.960]  oh, here's a picture of Roger Rabbit.
[20:39.360 --> 20:39.960]  He's the...
[20:39.960 --> 20:40.840]  Who is Roger Rabbit?
[20:40.860 --> 20:41.780]  Who is Roger Rabbit?
[20:42.440 --> 20:43.840]  In something cooking.
[20:43.980 --> 20:44.700]  That was probably the best part
[20:44.700 --> 20:45.380]  about that movie.
[20:45.380 --> 20:46.720]  He was a little baby.
[20:46.960 --> 20:47.260]  Short.
[20:47.360 --> 20:47.860]  There he is again.
[20:48.120 --> 20:49.400]  The rolling pin tumbles.
[20:49.780 --> 20:50.160]  And here we have,
[20:50.200 --> 20:50.440]  Cut!
[20:51.640 --> 20:52.520]  And then here we have,
[20:52.820 --> 20:53.500]  a narrow escape.
[20:54.740 --> 20:55.920]  And then finally,
[20:56.080 --> 20:57.820]  talk about a getaway car.
[20:58.380 --> 21:00.360]  We did the Roger Rabbit ride
[21:00.360 --> 21:00.800]  at Disneyland.
[21:01.400 --> 21:01.600]  Yeah.
[21:01.720 --> 21:02.360]  I think that's gone.
[21:02.800 --> 21:03.060]  Oh.
[21:03.440 --> 21:05.340]  I think that's a Mickey and Minnie ride now.
[21:05.800 --> 21:06.060]  Really?
[21:06.920 --> 21:08.640]  Yeah, they had to redo Toontown,
[21:08.720 --> 21:09.540]  the thing nobody went to.
[21:09.820 --> 21:10.380]  Oh, yeah.
[21:10.600 --> 21:11.720]  I remember when that opened up.
[21:11.860 --> 21:12.320]  Me too.
[21:12.560 --> 21:13.800]  It was very exciting
[21:13.800 --> 21:14.860]  because I was a child.
[21:14.860 --> 21:15.300]  Yeah.
[21:15.580 --> 21:17.400]  Alright, last mail we got.
[21:17.500 --> 21:18.200]  Let's see what we got here.
[21:18.320 --> 21:19.860]  We got gargoyles,
[21:21.000 --> 21:21.360]  rugrats,
[21:22.680 --> 21:23.660]  and Backstreet Boys.
[21:23.780 --> 21:24.280]  Here's what we're gonna do.
[21:24.320 --> 21:25.320]  We're gonna open the Backstreet Boys.
[21:25.400 --> 21:26.320]  We'll put these in the packs.
[21:26.700 --> 21:27.920]  Gotta feed the packsack.
[21:28.080 --> 21:29.420]  Emily, are you Backstreet Boys
[21:29.420 --> 21:29.980]  or NSYNC?
[21:30.120 --> 21:30.480]  NSYNC.
[21:30.640 --> 21:32.640]  Did you dislike Backstreet Boys?
[21:33.040 --> 21:33.980]  No, but you always just have
[21:33.980 --> 21:34.540]  like a hierarchy.
[21:34.740 --> 21:35.600]  There was a rivalry.
[21:36.240 --> 21:37.260]  When you talk...
[21:37.260 --> 21:37.860]  It was a Britney-Christina
[21:37.860 --> 21:38.580]  kind of situation.
[21:38.860 --> 21:39.560]  When you talk about
[21:39.560 --> 21:40.780]  Backstreet Boys and NSYNC,
[21:40.940 --> 21:42.160]  is New Kids on the Block
[21:42.160 --> 21:43.340]  a part of the conversation
[21:43.340 --> 21:43.720]  or is that
[21:43.720 --> 21:44.640]  a previous generation?
[21:44.900 --> 21:44.940]  Previous.
[21:45.100 --> 21:46.780]  That was ten years before them.
[21:46.780 --> 21:47.580]  That was my generation.
[21:47.600 --> 21:48.760]  And then like Jonas Brothers
[21:48.760 --> 21:49.720]  was after them.
[21:50.060 --> 21:51.560]  Like they were within like
[21:52.200 --> 21:52.560]  the...
[21:52.560 --> 21:53.320]  a lot of bands
[21:53.320 --> 21:54.100]  that came out of Orlando.
[21:54.380 --> 21:54.600]  Yeah.
[21:55.160 --> 21:55.940]  Oh, yeah.
[21:56.020 --> 21:57.040]  They were all Mickey Mouse kids.
[21:58.020 --> 21:58.900]  Were you like
[21:58.900 --> 22:00.080]  big hanging tough guy or what?
[22:00.160 --> 22:00.800]  No, I hated
[22:00.800 --> 22:01.480]  New Kids on the Block.
[22:01.640 --> 22:02.020]  I just...
[22:02.700 --> 22:03.620]  I couldn't stand them.
[22:03.720 --> 22:04.300]  Yeah, I just...
[22:04.300 --> 22:05.000]  I always kind of...
[22:05.000 --> 22:05.900]  They're all the same thing to me.
[22:06.280 --> 22:07.360]  I was about four,
[22:07.540 --> 22:09.200]  so it just sounded good
[22:09.200 --> 22:10.220]  to my four-year-old ears.
[22:10.400 --> 22:10.740]  You know what I mean?
[22:10.740 --> 22:11.160]  Of course, of course.
[22:11.160 --> 22:12.320]  It's like not good music,
[22:12.320 --> 22:13.160]  but it was, you know,
[22:13.160 --> 22:13.840]  very much like
[22:13.840 --> 22:14.160]  you're four,
[22:14.280 --> 22:14.960]  you'll listen to this.
[22:15.180 --> 22:16.180]  It's designed to sound
[22:16.180 --> 22:16.800]  good to four-year-olds.
[22:16.900 --> 22:17.000]  Yeah.
[22:17.560 --> 22:18.120]  There we go.
[22:18.160 --> 22:18.880]  There's that dude.
[22:19.060 --> 22:19.360]  AJ?
[22:19.620 --> 22:19.980]  AJ.
[22:20.200 --> 22:21.660]  I think he's sucking on that mic.
[22:21.800 --> 22:21.960]  Yeah.
[22:23.620 --> 22:24.340]  Well, that's...
[22:24.340 --> 22:25.140]  What happened there?
[22:25.220 --> 22:25.520]  Oh.
[22:26.540 --> 22:26.900]  That's...
[22:26.900 --> 22:27.680]  What the fuck?
[22:27.680 --> 22:28.280]  Leave it, leave it, leave it.
[22:28.380 --> 22:28.580]  What the fuck?
[22:28.580 --> 22:29.380]  Is this supposed to be like that?
[22:29.940 --> 22:31.140]  It came like that.
[22:32.000 --> 22:32.880]  The Backstreet Boys
[22:32.880 --> 22:33.560]  have been censored.
[22:34.040 --> 22:34.820]  That's gotta be...
[22:34.820 --> 22:36.040]  That's a one of one.
[22:36.600 --> 22:37.260]  That's pretty cool.
[22:37.920 --> 22:39.320]  and then I guess maybe...
[22:39.320 --> 22:40.320]  No one will ever know.
[22:40.520 --> 22:41.360]  No one will ever know.
[22:41.480 --> 22:42.120]  It's pretty cool.
[22:43.240 --> 22:44.700]  One of the guys...
[22:44.700 --> 22:44.900]  Yeah.
[22:45.500 --> 22:46.140]  Oh shit.
[22:46.520 --> 22:47.320]  What about this one?
[22:47.520 --> 22:48.120]  That's AJ also.
[22:48.280 --> 22:49.260]  We've gotten three AJ cards,
[22:49.340 --> 22:49.560]  I think.
[22:50.100 --> 22:51.500]  These photos are real shit.
[22:51.780 --> 22:52.480]  Dude, I gotta grow
[22:52.480 --> 22:53.540]  facial hair like that.
[22:53.680 --> 22:53.860]  Yeah.
[22:54.320 --> 22:54.640]  That's...
[22:54.640 --> 22:55.620]  If I could grow facial hair,
[22:55.700 --> 22:56.160]  that's what I would...
[22:56.160 --> 22:57.260]  I think I'd really mix it up
[22:57.260 --> 22:57.920]  to the point where I'd be
[22:57.920 --> 22:58.780]  doing stuff like this.
[22:58.880 --> 22:59.900]  I think you could fill it in.
[22:59.980 --> 23:00.500]  Who's this one?
[23:00.540 --> 23:01.060]  Because he looks like
[23:01.060 --> 23:01.880]  he's at Thunderdome.
[23:01.940 --> 23:02.460]  His name is Kevin.
[23:02.880 --> 23:03.180]  Kevin.
[23:04.380 --> 23:05.540]  And then is that...
[23:05.880 --> 23:06.520]  Kevin again?
[23:06.520 --> 23:07.060]  That's also Kevin.
[23:07.420 --> 23:08.360]  Still in the Thunderdome.
[23:08.480 --> 23:08.560]  Yeah.
[23:08.780 --> 23:09.380]  Still in Thunderdome.
[23:10.240 --> 23:11.540]  Do you guys remember
[23:11.540 --> 23:12.960]  the World Music Awards
[23:12.960 --> 23:13.560]  in Monaco?
[23:14.660 --> 23:15.980]  One of the guys isn't there.
[23:16.160 --> 23:16.520]  Brian?
[23:16.640 --> 23:17.280]  Brian is not there.
[23:17.280 --> 23:18.280]  He's in this one, I bet.
[23:18.440 --> 23:18.840]  Yes, he is.
[23:18.860 --> 23:19.460]  The Los Angeles
[23:19.460 --> 23:20.480]  Billboard Music Awards.
[23:20.500 --> 23:21.840]  There was some rumors
[23:21.840 --> 23:23.520]  of him being very proud.
[23:24.900 --> 23:25.100]  Really?
[23:25.100 --> 23:26.700]  Or at least a fan or friends
[23:26.700 --> 23:28.600]  with some very proud people.
[23:28.600 --> 23:29.600]  Oh, I see what you're saying.
[23:30.820 --> 23:31.260]  That's pretty cool.
[23:31.300 --> 23:32.560]  Is he going to jail for 33 years?
[23:32.620 --> 23:33.240]  That's awesome.
[23:33.380 --> 23:33.780]  I don't know.
[23:34.000 --> 23:34.680]  Is that like what that
[23:35.800 --> 23:37.720]  member of Hansen was liking
[23:37.720 --> 23:38.540]  the wrong stuff on
[23:39.940 --> 23:40.880]  Pinterest of all things?
[23:40.880 --> 23:41.680]  Yeah, it was Pinterest.
[23:41.900 --> 23:42.480]  He got pouted.
[23:43.980 --> 23:45.520]  MTV Music Awards
[23:45.520 --> 23:46.480]  in Rotterdam.
[23:46.660 --> 23:47.360]  That's Europe.
[23:47.500 --> 23:48.200]  It doesn't even count.
[23:48.580 --> 23:49.720]  Here's the blonde one
[23:49.720 --> 23:50.680]  singing a song.
[23:50.820 --> 23:51.500]  That's Nick Carter.
[23:51.900 --> 23:52.360]  Nick Carter.
[23:52.580 --> 23:54.180]  And then here's...
[23:54.180 --> 23:54.940]  This is cool.
[23:55.020 --> 23:55.740]  This is a foil.
[23:56.560 --> 23:57.520]  Larger Than Life,
[23:57.600 --> 23:58.280]  number one song.
[23:58.380 --> 23:59.340]  Yeah, man, that's cool.
[23:59.480 --> 24:00.380]  Yeah, look at that.
[24:04.480 --> 24:05.340]  Is that the song?
[24:05.540 --> 24:05.700]  Yeah.
[24:06.020 --> 24:06.380]  I don't know.
[24:06.440 --> 24:07.000]  And then they all start
[24:07.000 --> 24:07.740]  going like, yeah!
[24:08.840 --> 24:09.640]  I watched TRL
[24:09.640 --> 24:10.420]  and then I called in.
[24:10.460 --> 24:11.060]  I said, I want to vote
[24:11.060 --> 24:11.820]  for Papa Roach.
[24:12.420 --> 24:13.060]  You were down
[24:13.060 --> 24:13.580]  in Times Square?
[24:13.700 --> 24:14.380]  Papa Roach!
[24:15.860 --> 24:16.500]  Papa Roach!
[24:17.980 --> 24:18.880]  All right, we're going to
[24:18.880 --> 24:19.420]  open up some of those
[24:19.420 --> 24:20.300]  recon we didn't finish
[24:20.300 --> 24:20.640]  last time.
[24:20.640 --> 24:20.840]  Yeah.
[24:21.240 --> 24:21.640]  All right, we're good.
[24:22.660 --> 24:23.300]  Uzman Dang,
[24:23.660 --> 24:24.740]  rookie, Future Legends.
[24:24.860 --> 24:25.300]  That's probably worth
[24:25.300 --> 24:25.860]  three or four bucks.
[24:25.940 --> 24:26.680]  We'll throw that in the
[24:26.680 --> 24:27.740]  pile like last week.
[24:28.480 --> 24:29.120]  Kendall Brown,
[24:29.120 --> 24:29.960]  bass rookie.
[24:30.180 --> 24:30.340]  Okay.
[24:31.800 --> 24:32.560]  DeMar DeRozan.
[24:33.260 --> 24:34.140]  He's going to slowly
[24:34.140 --> 24:34.700]  fade out.
[24:34.780 --> 24:34.900]  Yeah.
[24:35.500 --> 24:35.880]  Why?
[24:37.040 --> 24:38.380]  Because he doesn't...
[24:38.380 --> 24:38.920]  He's not performing?
[24:39.480 --> 24:41.020]  He's really, really good,
[24:41.080 --> 24:42.160]  but it's hard to slot a
[24:42.160 --> 24:42.980]  player like him into
[24:42.980 --> 24:43.600]  certain teams.
[24:43.660 --> 24:45.160]  And he's not good enough
[24:45.160 --> 24:45.960]  to be the number one
[24:45.960 --> 24:46.940]  option on a team.
[24:47.180 --> 24:49.540]  And so he costs a lot of
[24:49.540 --> 24:50.380]  money because of how
[24:50.380 --> 24:51.160]  good he is, but he's not
[24:51.160 --> 24:52.160]  the right kind of good
[24:52.160 --> 24:53.040]  if that makes sense to
[24:53.040 --> 24:54.100]  build a championship
[24:54.100 --> 24:54.780]  team around.
[24:54.840 --> 24:55.140]  I'm not talking about
[24:55.140 --> 24:55.720]  building a championship
[24:55.720 --> 24:56.080]  team.
[24:56.140 --> 24:56.720]  Have you seen what the
[24:56.720 --> 24:57.980]  fucking Warriors are doing?
[24:57.980 --> 24:58.260]  Yeah.
[24:58.700 --> 24:59.740]  Warriors aren't the
[24:59.740 --> 25:00.200]  Lakers, man.
[25:00.420 --> 25:02.800]  They are small and not
[25:02.800 --> 25:04.160]  defensively strong, so
[25:04.160 --> 25:04.860]  they're going to score
[25:04.860 --> 25:06.740]  180 points every game.
[25:06.900 --> 25:07.740]  They are determined.
[25:07.740 --> 25:07.920]  That's their goal.
[25:08.120 --> 25:09.600]  They are determined to
[25:09.600 --> 25:11.120]  shoot from three every
[25:11.120 --> 25:11.640]  possession.
[25:11.960 --> 25:12.600]  Wild.
[25:13.120 --> 25:15.420]  Some bonus and then
[25:15.420 --> 25:16.840]  Josh giddy up giddy.
[25:17.320 --> 25:18.540]  When your defensive
[25:18.540 --> 25:20.480]  answer is Klay Thompson
[25:20.480 --> 25:21.640]  and Draymond Green in
[25:21.640 --> 25:22.200]  2023.
[25:23.160 --> 25:23.620]  Yeah.
[25:23.740 --> 25:24.860]  Because what...
[25:24.860 --> 25:26.920]  Chris Paul gonna...
[25:26.920 --> 25:27.700]  You walk around...
[25:27.700 --> 25:27.960]  He's going to
[25:29.540 --> 25:30.600]  like in practice.
[25:30.780 --> 25:31.540]  It's like cones.
[25:31.720 --> 25:32.500]  Just go around him.
[25:33.000 --> 25:33.840]  Fucking the best.
[25:34.660 --> 25:35.520]  Pat Bev plan.
[25:35.680 --> 25:36.140]  Who signed him?
[25:36.360 --> 25:37.600]  Oh, shit.
[25:37.760 --> 25:38.260]  What do we get?
[25:39.540 --> 25:40.340]  We're putting in the
[25:40.340 --> 25:40.800]  back.
[25:40.940 --> 25:41.080]  Wow.
[25:41.240 --> 25:41.800]  That is good.
[25:41.960 --> 25:42.500]  Come back to that.
[25:42.560 --> 25:43.520]  I'm not familiar with
[25:43.520 --> 25:43.660]  that.
[25:43.680 --> 25:44.300]  I'm not familiar with
[25:44.300 --> 25:45.380]  that parallel or that
[25:45.380 --> 25:45.600]  insert.
[25:45.700 --> 25:46.060]  All right, Laurie
[25:46.060 --> 25:46.460]  Markkinen.
[25:48.500 --> 25:49.380]  Fucking turned out to
[25:49.380 --> 25:50.080]  be all-star Laurie
[25:50.080 --> 25:50.380]  Markkinen.
[25:52.600 --> 25:53.320]  Jalen McDaniels.
[25:53.340 --> 25:54.060]  Here's the Lonnie
[25:54.060 --> 25:54.960]  Walker base.
[25:55.980 --> 25:56.700]  Here we got a Chris
[25:56.700 --> 25:57.500]  Dabbs Porzingis wearing
[25:57.500 --> 25:58.300]  the wrong goddamn
[25:58.300 --> 25:58.820]  uniform.
[25:59.140 --> 25:59.900]  Something now.
[26:00.980 --> 26:01.740]  Jordan Clarkson.
[26:01.900 --> 26:02.720]  Those Utah jerseys
[26:02.720 --> 26:03.220]  suck.
[26:03.460 --> 26:03.620]  Jordan...
[26:03.620 --> 26:04.500]  They're so boring.
[26:04.700 --> 26:05.440]  Jordan Clarkson's
[26:05.440 --> 26:06.880]  gonna be in our
[26:06.880 --> 26:08.340]  upcoming common thread.
[26:09.040 --> 26:09.860]  A little game we're
[26:09.860 --> 26:10.500]  gonna play next week.
[26:10.620 --> 26:11.260]  That's exciting.
[26:11.380 --> 26:11.640]  He's in that.
[26:11.720 --> 26:12.840]  And then, last but not
[26:12.840 --> 26:13.560]  least, I've never seen
[26:13.560 --> 26:13.720]  this before.
[26:13.720 --> 26:14.480]  Oh, holy shit.
[26:14.820 --> 26:15.280]  That's sick.
[26:15.520 --> 26:16.400]  Recon Vector.
[26:16.600 --> 26:17.220]  Is it numbered?
[26:18.180 --> 26:18.460]  No.
[26:18.460 --> 26:18.980]  That's pretty cool.
[26:19.120 --> 26:19.840]  It might not be worth
[26:19.840 --> 26:20.680]  anything, but I've never
[26:20.680 --> 26:21.400]  seen this parallel.
[26:21.520 --> 26:22.180]  Oh, it's really neat.
[26:22.180 --> 26:23.040]  It's really beautiful.
[26:23.040 --> 26:23.900]  How cool would it be to
[26:23.900 --> 26:24.720]  be that person in the
[26:24.720 --> 26:25.020]  background?
[26:25.120 --> 26:25.700]  I was gonna say, can you
[26:25.700 --> 26:26.340]  recognize any of them?
[26:26.400 --> 26:27.120]  Are they even murderers?
[26:27.180 --> 26:28.260]  That's all I wanna be, is
[26:28.260 --> 26:28.860]  just someone in the
[26:28.860 --> 26:29.160]  background.
[26:29.320 --> 26:29.920]  You know, you're
[26:29.920 --> 26:32.340]  referring to the Mark
[26:32.340 --> 26:33.560]  Jackson card that has
[26:33.560 --> 26:35.160]  the Menendez brothers.
[26:35.420 --> 26:36.280]  There's a new one that
[26:36.280 --> 26:37.560]  has a bunch of people
[26:37.560 --> 26:37.840]  in it.
[26:37.920 --> 26:38.800]  I need to try to collect
[26:38.800 --> 26:38.900]  it.
[26:38.940 --> 26:39.520]  It's a John Morant
[26:39.520 --> 26:40.000]  rookie, though.
[26:40.180 --> 26:40.900]  Who's in the back?
[26:41.940 --> 26:43.260]  Todd Bridges, two
[26:43.260 --> 26:44.460]  different rappers, and
[26:44.460 --> 26:45.480]  then the parents from
[26:45.480 --> 26:46.140]  the blind side.
[26:47.200 --> 26:47.760]  Oh, shit.
[26:47.900 --> 26:48.540]  All sandwiched in the
[26:48.540 --> 26:48.940]  same card.
[26:49.060 --> 26:49.880]  We were talking to
[26:50.320 --> 26:51.280]  General Manager Jordan
[26:51.280 --> 26:52.400]  Levin about it, because
[26:52.400 --> 26:53.100]  he was like, oh, yeah,
[26:53.180 --> 26:53.760]  because he'll send us
[26:53.760 --> 26:54.340]  cards sometimes.
[26:54.480 --> 26:55.380]  Check this out, whatever.
[26:55.540 --> 26:56.200]  And Geoff will be like,
[26:56.300 --> 26:57.500]  this is the new one.
[26:57.540 --> 26:58.200]  He sent that.
[26:58.380 --> 26:58.860]  We were just like,
[26:58.920 --> 26:59.880]  what the fuck?
[27:00.600 --> 27:01.300]  Dude, we gotta remember
[27:01.300 --> 27:01.900]  to do this.
[27:01.980 --> 27:02.660]  This is still such a
[27:02.660 --> 27:02.760]  good idea.
[27:02.760 --> 27:03.600]  We're gonna do it soon.
[27:03.620 --> 27:04.280]  Now that we're done
[27:04.280 --> 27:04.960]  with the ultimate
[27:04.960 --> 27:06.260]  playlist of 98, we need
[27:06.260 --> 27:06.780]  to make the ultimate
[27:06.780 --> 27:08.720]  playlist of superstars
[27:08.720 --> 27:09.240]  cards.
[27:09.520 --> 27:09.940]  Yeah, the ultimate
[27:09.940 --> 27:10.680]  superstar playlist.
[27:11.500 --> 27:12.400]  We're gonna do that on
[27:12.400 --> 27:13.500]  the main, on the
[27:13.500 --> 27:14.100]  show.
[27:14.400 --> 27:15.020]  Yeah, I'm pretty
[27:15.020 --> 27:15.620]  excited about it.
[27:15.620 --> 27:16.080]  I think it's gonna be
[27:16.080 --> 27:16.480]  a lot of fun.
[27:16.640 --> 27:17.040]  Perfect gentleman.
[27:17.220 --> 27:17.800]  I gotta be honest.
[27:17.880 --> 27:18.500]  I don't know who
[27:18.500 --> 27:18.920]  they are.
[27:19.000 --> 27:19.620]  I have no memory of
[27:19.620 --> 27:19.720]  them.
[27:19.840 --> 27:20.260]  Let's see it.
[27:20.260 --> 27:20.700]  Let's learn a little
[27:20.700 --> 27:21.200]  bit about perfect
[27:21.200 --> 27:21.460]  gentlemen.
[27:21.560 --> 27:21.760]  Okay.
[27:21.940 --> 27:22.440]  Very rarity.
[27:23.740 --> 27:25.320]  Having, having groomed
[27:25.320 --> 27:25.880]  new addition.
[27:26.100 --> 27:27.040]  Shouldn't use that
[27:27.040 --> 27:27.240]  word.
[27:27.380 --> 27:27.720]  Bad word.
[27:27.860 --> 27:28.020]  Yeah.
[27:28.100 --> 27:28.480]  Perfect gentlemen.
[27:29.300 --> 27:30.000]  These perfect gentlemen
[27:30.000 --> 27:30.700]  are grooming new
[27:30.700 --> 27:31.080]  addition.
[27:31.360 --> 27:31.720]  Milady.
[27:33.120 --> 27:34.120]  I'm just reading
[27:34.120 --> 27:34.960]  what's on the card.
[27:36.320 --> 27:37.220]  Having groomed new
[27:37.220 --> 27:39.260]  addition, then new kids
[27:39.260 --> 27:39.800]  on the block.
[27:40.040 --> 27:40.340]  Stop!
[27:40.460 --> 27:41.180]  Super stardom during
[27:41.180 --> 27:41.840]  the 80s.
[27:42.300 --> 27:42.940]  Oh, it gets worse.
[27:43.360 --> 27:44.880]  Producer Marie Starr
[27:44.880 --> 27:46.720]  Sr. began in the current
[27:46.720 --> 27:47.820]  decade of launching yet
[27:47.820 --> 27:48.880]  another teen heartthrob
[27:48.880 --> 27:50.320]  vocal group from the
[27:50.320 --> 27:51.100]  Boston area.
[27:51.360 --> 27:51.660]  Perfect gentlemen.
[27:51.660 --> 27:52.120]  Young boys.
[27:52.900 --> 27:54.400]  Album rated PG.
[27:54.900 --> 27:55.080]  Oh.
[27:55.140 --> 27:55.580]  Oh, get it?
[27:55.740 --> 27:56.320]  Oh, boy.
[27:56.740 --> 27:57.060]  All right.
[27:57.280 --> 27:58.580]  That shit's, that's
[27:58.580 --> 27:58.980]  corny.
[27:59.400 --> 28:00.400]  That's like Paul George
[28:00.400 --> 28:01.100]  PG-13.
[28:01.240 --> 28:01.740]  That's so corny.
[28:01.780 --> 28:02.320]  B.B. King.
[28:02.460 --> 28:02.980]  That's cool.
[28:03.300 --> 28:03.680]  Legend indeed.
[28:04.000 --> 28:04.420]  That is a cool
[28:04.420 --> 28:04.940]  fucking card.
[28:05.040 --> 28:05.520]  That's a cool card.
[28:06.140 --> 28:06.580]  Yeah!
[28:08.880 --> 28:09.760]  He's got you in a
[28:09.760 --> 28:10.320]  stranglehold.
[28:10.980 --> 28:11.200]  What?
[28:11.700 --> 28:13.180]  It's like a, like a
[28:13.180 --> 28:14.520]  actual turd on a card.
[28:14.600 --> 28:15.720]  It's so cool that he
[28:15.720 --> 28:16.800]  could have just shut up
[28:16.800 --> 28:17.140]  forever.
[28:17.480 --> 28:19.040]  He could have just had
[28:19.040 --> 28:19.740]  stranglehold and
[28:19.740 --> 28:20.600]  cat scratch fever and
[28:20.600 --> 28:21.280]  that's all I needed you
[28:21.280 --> 28:21.480]  for.
[28:21.760 --> 28:22.340]  And now you're like,
[28:22.440 --> 28:23.480]  here's my opinion.
[28:23.740 --> 28:24.140]  But you gotta get
[28:24.140 --> 28:25.120]  involved in shit.
[28:25.700 --> 28:26.560]  Debbie Gibson.
[28:26.860 --> 28:28.680]  Her and Tiffany.
[28:28.900 --> 28:29.280]  They were the best.
[28:29.880 --> 28:31.200]  They were my, so they
[28:31.200 --> 28:31.820]  were my Brittany
[28:31.820 --> 28:32.200]  Christina.
[28:32.520 --> 28:33.340]  They were the mall
[28:33.340 --> 28:33.640]  singers.
[28:33.640 --> 28:34.440]  Yeah, which side
[28:34.440 --> 28:34.840]  were you on?
[28:35.160 --> 28:35.560]  Were you Debbie
[28:35.560 --> 28:36.400]  Gibson or were you
[28:36.400 --> 28:36.700]  Tiffany?
[28:37.260 --> 28:38.720]  Uh, I liked both.
[28:38.800 --> 28:39.160]  I didn't know what
[28:39.160 --> 28:39.580]  I had to pick.
[28:40.680 --> 28:41.440]  If I had to pick,
[28:41.500 --> 28:41.960]  I'd probably pick
[28:41.960 --> 28:42.260]  Tiffany.
[28:42.560 --> 28:43.040]  Yeah, me too.
[28:43.340 --> 28:44.640]  Uh, London Choir
[28:44.640 --> 28:45.020]  Boys.
[28:45.580 --> 28:45.940]  Oh.
[28:46.200 --> 28:46.560]  What?
[28:46.940 --> 28:47.620]  You know, I heard
[28:47.620 --> 28:48.240]  they used to...
[28:48.240 --> 28:49.440]  That is not how you
[28:49.440 --> 28:49.860]  spell that.
[28:49.960 --> 28:50.800]  I heard they used to
[28:51.420 --> 28:52.300]  castrate choir boys,
[28:52.380 --> 28:52.520]  right?
[28:52.640 --> 28:53.140]  I wonder if these
[28:53.140 --> 28:53.760]  dudes were castrated.
[28:54.260 --> 28:54.600]  Probably.
[28:55.420 --> 28:56.000]  George Michael.
[28:57.140 --> 28:57.740]  Famously not
[28:57.740 --> 28:58.160]  castrated.
[29:00.840 --> 29:01.820]  You like that?
[29:02.080 --> 29:02.980]  I think it's good.
[29:03.040 --> 29:03.700]  I think it could
[29:03.700 --> 29:04.660]  be used at some
[29:04.660 --> 29:04.940]  point.
[29:05.120 --> 29:05.560]  Yeah, okay.
[29:06.360 --> 29:07.200]  Uh, enough
[29:07.200 --> 29:07.640]  is enough.
[29:07.880 --> 29:09.080]  Dude, that sucks.
[29:09.200 --> 29:10.260]  I fucking hated
[29:10.260 --> 29:10.280]  them.
[29:10.280 --> 29:11.500]  Look at this man
[29:13.180 --> 29:14.540]  that saw poison and
[29:14.540 --> 29:15.260]  went, fuck, we could
[29:15.260 --> 29:15.780]  do that.
[29:16.400 --> 29:17.460]  I hated them
[29:17.460 --> 29:17.920]  when I was
[29:17.920 --> 29:18.040]  growing up.
[29:18.320 --> 29:19.200]  Vanilla ice.
[29:19.360 --> 29:20.040]  Oh, that's...
[29:20.040 --> 29:20.800]  I hate vanilla
[29:20.800 --> 29:21.220]  ice.
[29:21.260 --> 29:21.860]  I gotta add that
[29:21.860 --> 29:22.700]  to my food.
[29:23.060 --> 29:23.600]  I have a food.
[29:23.740 --> 29:23.940]  Yeah.
[29:24.060 --> 29:24.720]  Oh, we have another
[29:24.720 --> 29:25.260]  one in the chat.
[29:25.260 --> 29:26.880]  What is that?
[29:27.080 --> 29:27.260]  The who?
[29:27.460 --> 29:28.780]  That is a concert
[29:29.500 --> 29:30.600]  flyer for the who
[29:30.600 --> 29:31.560]  back when they did
[29:31.560 --> 29:32.400]  the Joshua Light
[29:32.400 --> 29:33.360]  show at the Fillmore
[29:33.360 --> 29:33.600]  East.
[29:34.200 --> 29:34.340]  Huh.
[29:35.420 --> 29:36.000]  Yeah, the Fillmore
[29:36.000 --> 29:36.220]  East.
[29:36.660 --> 29:37.700]  Oh, here's Big Daddy
[29:37.700 --> 29:38.180]  Kane.
[29:38.440 --> 29:38.840]  Alright.
[29:39.760 --> 29:40.480]  Dude, that's awesome.
[29:40.660 --> 29:41.040]  In the purple?
[29:41.300 --> 29:41.840]  So sick.
[29:42.180 --> 29:43.060]  Straight purple.
[29:43.600 --> 29:44.540]  Ten cents off
[29:44.540 --> 29:45.280]  your next purchase.
[29:45.400 --> 29:45.640]  Yeah!
[29:46.140 --> 29:46.920]  Oh, and then we
[29:46.920 --> 29:47.660]  find out if we won.
[29:47.920 --> 29:48.600]  Okay, here we go.
[29:48.980 --> 29:49.900]  One day we're gonna win.
[29:51.280 --> 29:51.780]  I don't know what
[29:51.780 --> 29:52.240]  we're gonna do if
[29:52.240 --> 29:52.920]  that happens.
[29:56.000 --> 29:56.820]  Sorry, I gotta
[29:56.820 --> 29:57.080]  try again.
[29:57.200 --> 29:57.460]  Damn it!
[29:58.240 --> 29:58.560]  Damn it!
[29:59.000 --> 29:59.800]  Alright, next time.
[30:01.280 --> 30:02.200]  It's bullshit.
[30:03.020 --> 30:03.440]  Fuck!
[30:03.640 --> 30:03.980]  Fuck!
[30:04.720 --> 30:06.020]  I wanna open up
[30:06.020 --> 30:06.640]  this next.
[30:06.860 --> 30:07.440]  This year's
[30:07.440 --> 30:08.580]  Pops Chrome 2022.
[30:08.780 --> 30:09.480]  These are hot cards.
[30:09.620 --> 30:10.200]  Everybody likes them.
[30:10.500 --> 30:11.160]  They're real purdy.
[30:11.460 --> 30:12.060]  What are you looking for?
[30:12.800 --> 30:13.620]  Uh, rookies.
[30:14.320 --> 30:14.720]  Yeah, okay.
[30:14.920 --> 30:15.360]  But like,
[30:15.440 --> 30:16.300]  specific players?
[30:16.320 --> 30:17.240]  Oh, uh,
[30:17.240 --> 30:17.940]  Corbin Carroll,
[30:18.160 --> 30:18.980]  Adley Richman.
[30:19.040 --> 30:19.300]  Yeah, any
[30:19.300 --> 30:20.220]  San Diego Padres,
[30:20.220 --> 30:21.220]  it's not Eric Osmer.
[30:21.720 --> 30:21.940]  Uh,
[30:22.080 --> 30:23.300]  J-Rod
[30:23.300 --> 30:24.200]  wouldn't be a rookie,
[30:24.400 --> 30:25.620]  but just anybody
[30:25.620 --> 30:26.460]  but Wander Franco
[30:26.460 --> 30:27.080]  right now.
[30:28.020 --> 30:28.420]  Who's doing
[30:29.480 --> 30:30.320]  We might have to
[30:30.320 --> 30:31.140]  commit that if it's a
[30:31.140 --> 30:31.860]  Wander Franco card,
[30:31.920 --> 30:32.480]  we throw it out.
[30:32.520 --> 30:33.360]  Yeah, we just set it
[30:33.360 --> 30:34.840]  We burn it live on stream.
[30:35.860 --> 30:36.740]  Who's doing well
[30:36.740 --> 30:37.460]  in baseball right now?
[30:37.480 --> 30:38.000]  Because isn't it like
[30:38.000 --> 30:38.920]  the kind of in-between?
[30:39.080 --> 30:39.760]  Oh, I can tell you.
[30:40.700 --> 30:41.420]  Padres are doing
[30:41.420 --> 30:41.760]  real well.
[30:42.380 --> 30:42.860]  Are they?
[30:43.160 --> 30:44.360]  I just made a bet.
[30:44.520 --> 30:45.900]  My buddy texted me
[30:45.900 --> 30:46.300]  and he's like,
[30:46.380 --> 30:47.080]  you ready to lose some
[30:47.080 --> 30:47.500]  money?
[30:48.320 --> 30:48.780]  He's like,
[30:48.840 --> 30:49.600]  you ready to lose some money?
[30:49.680 --> 30:49.920]  I'm like,
[30:49.980 --> 30:50.900]  I don't feel good about this,
[30:50.980 --> 30:52.160]  but I'll bet he's a Dodgers fan.
[30:52.200 --> 30:52.380]  I'm like,
[30:52.420 --> 30:53.000]  I'll bet you.
[30:53.140 --> 30:54.080]  I'll put 20 bucks down
[30:54.080 --> 30:54.440]  to like,
[30:54.500 --> 30:55.220]  just like win the series.
[30:55.220 --> 30:55.620]  But like,
[30:55.660 --> 30:56.160]  they're eliminated
[30:56.160 --> 30:57.260]  before the fucking angels are.
[30:57.660 --> 30:58.880]  I don't know if that says more
[30:58.880 --> 31:00.220]  about how the NL West was
[31:00.220 --> 31:01.440]  or how the AL West was
[31:01.440 --> 31:01.720]  because,
[31:02.420 --> 31:02.880]  fuck, man.
[31:03.720 --> 31:04.720]  They beat the shit out of
[31:04.720 --> 31:05.620]  the Astros the other day.
[31:05.660 --> 31:06.200]  That was awesome.
[31:06.880 --> 31:07.660]  So who's doing well
[31:07.660 --> 31:08.820]  in the baseball right now?
[31:08.980 --> 31:09.600]  In the baseball?
[31:09.740 --> 31:10.060]  Dodgers.
[31:10.320 --> 31:10.560]  Okay.
[31:10.720 --> 31:11.180]  Dodgers are doing
[31:11.180 --> 31:11.540]  real well.
[31:13.360 --> 31:13.760]  Astros.
[31:13.960 --> 31:14.100]  Yeah.
[31:14.180 --> 31:14.700]  Oh, yeah.
[31:15.980 --> 31:16.380]  Urias.
[31:16.780 --> 31:17.180]  It's a,
[31:17.280 --> 31:17.580]  oh my God,
[31:17.640 --> 31:18.560]  and Kevin Porter Jr.
[31:18.720 --> 31:19.040]  today.
[31:19.180 --> 31:19.600]  Did you hear about that?
[31:19.720 --> 31:21.060]  Oh, I did see that.
[31:21.160 --> 31:21.920]  I saw that before I got here.
[31:22.040 --> 31:22.140]  Yeah.
[31:23.320 --> 31:24.440]  More of the same.
[31:25.000 --> 31:25.800]  Houston Rocket,
[31:25.980 --> 31:26.520]  NBA player,
[31:26.580 --> 31:27.280]  got in trouble today.
[31:27.580 --> 31:29.100]  Urias getting knocked
[31:29.100 --> 31:30.240]  was a thing that
[31:30.240 --> 31:31.360]  I definitely saw coming.
[31:31.620 --> 31:32.100]  And then,
[31:32.260 --> 31:32.560]  um,
[31:32.900 --> 31:34.060]  so he's out forever.
[31:34.640 --> 31:35.040]  Uh,
[31:35.440 --> 31:36.520]  he'll probably...
[31:36.520 --> 31:37.180]  It's like the Dodgers
[31:37.180 --> 31:38.160]  lose a pitcher a year.
[31:38.280 --> 31:38.460]  Yeah,
[31:38.540 --> 31:39.360]  that's weird how
[31:39.360 --> 31:40.300]  that's the character
[31:40.300 --> 31:41.040]  of the team, huh?
[31:41.540 --> 31:41.980]  Nuts.
[31:42.500 --> 31:43.340]  You can't say that
[31:43.340 --> 31:43.920]  about Freddie Freeman.
[31:44.620 --> 31:45.040]  No.
[31:45.640 --> 31:46.380]  What you can't say
[31:46.380 --> 31:47.020]  about Freddie Freeman
[31:47.020 --> 31:47.760]  is that
[31:47.760 --> 31:48.560]  Freddie Freeman
[31:48.560 --> 31:49.300]  didn't want to play
[31:49.300 --> 31:50.140]  in Los Angeles.
[31:50.540 --> 31:50.860]  That was all
[31:50.860 --> 31:51.340]  a misunderstanding.
[31:52.680 --> 31:53.880]  He and Mookie Betts
[31:53.880 --> 31:54.320]  are best friends.
[31:54.460 --> 31:54.680]  Uh-huh.
[31:54.840 --> 31:55.640]  Manny Ramirez.
[31:55.860 --> 31:56.220]  Hey.
[31:57.160 --> 31:57.600]  Uh,
[31:57.600 --> 31:58.680]  here's Zach Lother.
[31:59.840 --> 32:00.840]  Glass's baseball guy
[32:00.840 --> 32:01.480]  is always weird.
[32:02.080 --> 32:02.520]  That's...
[32:02.520 --> 32:03.300]  You know?
[32:03.880 --> 32:04.740]  That's a...
[32:05.260 --> 32:05.740]  What's up?
[32:05.840 --> 32:06.720]  It's a picture, right?
[32:06.780 --> 32:07.780]  That's not a photo.
[32:07.780 --> 32:08.280]  That's art.
[32:08.620 --> 32:10.160]  It's like when you put...
[32:10.160 --> 32:10.340]  Like AI.
[32:10.860 --> 32:12.080]  It's like when you put
[32:12.080 --> 32:13.280]  a picture in Instagram
[32:13.280 --> 32:14.180]  and then, like,
[32:14.220 --> 32:14.840]  you auto,
[32:15.460 --> 32:16.180]  like, adjust,
[32:16.260 --> 32:16.900]  like, the look
[32:16.900 --> 32:17.460]  and you turn it
[32:17.460 --> 32:18.000]  all the way up.
[32:19.640 --> 32:20.440]  One of the coolest
[32:20.440 --> 32:21.200]  motherfuckers ever,
[32:21.300 --> 32:21.700]  Dave Stewart.
[32:21.860 --> 32:22.180]  Hell yeah.
[32:22.260 --> 32:22.620]  Awesome.
[32:22.800 --> 32:23.660]  What's cool about him?
[32:23.820 --> 32:24.900]  I mean, he looks cool.
[32:24.900 --> 32:25.620]  He was just a badass.
[32:25.880 --> 32:26.540]  He was a cool dude.
[32:26.600 --> 32:27.320]  He was a good pitcher.
[32:27.540 --> 32:28.320]  He was a solid dude.
[32:28.620 --> 32:29.180]  One of my favorite
[32:29.180 --> 32:30.400]  Las Vegas athletics, man.
[32:32.240 --> 32:33.320]  And then final card
[32:33.320 --> 32:33.800]  out of that pack
[32:33.800 --> 32:34.560]  is numbered
[32:35.700 --> 32:36.060]  840...
[32:36.060 --> 32:36.820]  I'm sorry.
[32:37.620 --> 32:38.020]  43...
[32:38.020 --> 32:38.860]  It's hard to read it.
[32:38.920 --> 32:39.580]  43 to 100.
[32:40.600 --> 32:41.000]  Boom!
[32:41.240 --> 32:41.700]  Ozzy Smith!
[32:41.760 --> 32:42.160]  Hey!
[32:42.620 --> 32:43.120]  The Lizard.
[32:43.320 --> 32:44.220]  One of the fucking
[32:44.220 --> 32:45.560]  coolest dudes ever.
[32:45.960 --> 32:46.340]  That might be
[32:46.340 --> 32:47.200]  a decent little pull.
[32:47.280 --> 32:48.680]  Sort of a pink ice refractor.
[32:48.740 --> 32:49.420]  That'll do well.
[32:49.540 --> 32:49.980]  Let's go ahead
[32:49.980 --> 32:50.480]  and sleeve that.
[32:50.700 --> 32:51.860]  That's under 50, right?
[32:52.020 --> 32:52.200]  Yeah.
[32:52.320 --> 32:53.580]  That'll be the best card
[32:53.580 --> 32:54.300]  we get out of this.
[32:54.520 --> 32:55.680]  43 out of 100.
[32:55.980 --> 32:56.260]  Wow.
[32:56.360 --> 32:56.700]  Pretty cool.
[32:56.860 --> 32:57.220]  Pretty cool.
[32:57.320 --> 32:57.740]  Pretty cool.
[32:58.000 --> 32:58.260]  Pretty cool.
[32:58.260 --> 32:59.060]  Pretty cool.
[32:59.280 --> 33:00.220]  As true as Padre.
[33:00.400 --> 33:00.620]  Just saying.
[33:00.880 --> 33:01.560]  Someone said something
[33:01.560 --> 33:02.580]  about Debbie Gibson
[33:02.580 --> 33:03.460]  on Stern's show.
[33:03.540 --> 33:04.960]  Was she on there a lot?
[33:05.340 --> 33:05.780]  I don't know.
[33:06.200 --> 33:06.800]  She's been on Stern.
[33:06.940 --> 33:07.860]  I feel like she was
[33:07.860 --> 33:08.580]  on it once
[33:08.580 --> 33:09.200]  and it was like
[33:09.200 --> 33:10.080]  infamous interview.
[33:10.360 --> 33:11.500]  Like where it was like
[33:11.500 --> 33:12.440]  they really hammered her
[33:12.440 --> 33:13.300]  and she walked out
[33:13.300 --> 33:13.700]  or something.
[33:13.980 --> 33:14.840]  There's a
[33:15.800 --> 33:16.600]  Wanda Franco
[33:16.600 --> 33:16.900]  rookie.
[33:16.920 --> 33:17.640]  Are you serious?
[33:18.300 --> 33:19.300]  Get him out of here.
[33:19.380 --> 33:20.160]  George Brett.
[33:20.440 --> 33:21.320]  Johnny Damon.
[33:21.580 --> 33:21.900]  I didn't know
[33:21.900 --> 33:22.200]  Johnny Damon
[33:22.200 --> 33:22.780]  played for KC.
[33:22.940 --> 33:23.600]  Me neither.
[33:23.740 --> 33:24.620]  Why is it not like
[33:24.620 --> 33:25.240]  Wanda Franco?
[33:25.320 --> 33:26.220]  We'll talk about it
[33:26.220 --> 33:26.700]  after the show.
[33:28.680 --> 33:29.480]  Craig Diekman.
[33:29.480 --> 33:30.240]  Very similar
[33:30.760 --> 33:31.680]  but worse reasons
[33:31.680 --> 33:32.240]  to why we don't like
[33:32.240 --> 33:32.680]  the other dudes.
[33:33.260 --> 33:33.940]  Oh, shit.
[33:34.040 --> 33:34.820]  JD Martinez.
[33:35.860 --> 33:36.200]  Refractor.
[33:36.280 --> 33:36.900]  That's nice.
[33:37.040 --> 33:37.620]  We'll sleeve that.
[33:38.360 --> 33:38.680]  And then I guess
[33:38.680 --> 33:39.600]  we'll sleeve this dude
[33:39.600 --> 33:40.180]  I've never heard of.
[33:40.520 --> 33:41.220]  I don't remember.
[33:41.300 --> 33:41.740]  When did he play
[33:41.740 --> 33:42.400]  on Kansas City?
[33:42.560 --> 33:43.360]  The end of his career
[33:43.360 --> 33:43.840]  or the beginning?
[33:44.040 --> 33:44.700]  I think it would have to be
[33:44.700 --> 33:45.560]  at the beginning, right?
[33:45.660 --> 33:46.320]  I guess so.
[33:46.520 --> 33:47.260]  Because he was an A
[33:47.260 --> 33:48.320]  wasn't he for a while?
[33:48.480 --> 33:49.240]  And then he was a
[33:49.240 --> 33:50.120]  Red Sox.
[33:50.740 --> 33:52.040]  He just went around.
[33:52.520 --> 33:54.180]  I mean he's a Red Sox.
[33:54.380 --> 33:55.520]  That's what you think
[33:55.520 --> 33:56.000]  of him as.
[33:56.260 --> 33:56.380]  Oh, yeah.
[33:59.440 --> 34:00.320]  Cattell Marte.
[34:00.320 --> 34:01.000]  Cattell Marte.
[34:01.320 --> 34:01.760]  Marte.
[34:01.920 --> 34:02.980]  He's like the guy there.
[34:03.200 --> 34:03.800]  Oh, Lubav.
[34:03.900 --> 34:04.460]  That's nice.
[34:04.640 --> 34:05.240]  That's a cool card.
[34:05.380 --> 34:05.720]  Not a leader.
[34:06.280 --> 34:08.040]  One of...
[34:09.040 --> 34:10.500]  That's a menacing photo.
[34:11.860 --> 34:13.020]  Yeah, he's not a leader though.
[34:13.040 --> 34:13.500]  Not a leader.
[34:13.680 --> 34:13.920]  No.
[34:14.280 --> 34:14.940]  Great player.
[34:15.060 --> 34:15.500]  Not a leader.
[34:15.800 --> 34:17.420]  White Sox are the
[34:18.300 --> 34:19.540]  most disappointing team
[34:19.540 --> 34:19.940]  in baseball.
[34:20.120 --> 34:20.780]  They're probably the most
[34:20.780 --> 34:21.460]  disappointing team
[34:21.460 --> 34:22.520]  of this decade.
[34:22.920 --> 34:23.260]  Why?
[34:23.740 --> 34:24.520]  Because they shouldn't
[34:24.520 --> 34:25.400]  be very good.
[34:25.420 --> 34:26.420]  And they fucking
[34:26.420 --> 34:27.400]  suck shit.
[34:28.080 --> 34:28.820]  Oh, no.
[34:28.980 --> 34:29.840]  They suck and they
[34:29.840 --> 34:30.180]  don't...
[34:30.180 --> 34:30.860]  And the worst part is
[34:30.860 --> 34:31.740]  they don't care.
[34:32.080 --> 34:33.080]  Yeah, they don't care.
[34:33.200 --> 34:34.260]  And so a bunch of
[34:34.260 --> 34:35.100]  stuff in the locker
[34:35.100 --> 34:36.240]  room started to leak out.
[34:37.080 --> 34:37.820]  Like what?
[34:38.000 --> 34:38.300]  Like them
[34:38.300 --> 34:38.760]  talking shit?
[34:39.000 --> 34:39.280]  Oh, yeah.
[34:39.380 --> 34:40.300]  It was just a bunch
[34:40.300 --> 34:40.740]  of people going,
[34:40.880 --> 34:41.740]  there are no leaders
[34:41.740 --> 34:42.200]  on this team.
[34:42.320 --> 34:42.960]  There are guys that
[34:42.960 --> 34:43.700]  just show up.
[34:44.100 --> 34:44.820]  There are guys that
[34:44.820 --> 34:45.940]  don't give a fuck
[34:45.940 --> 34:46.780]  about being on this team.
[34:46.780 --> 34:47.900]  Eloy got hit with that.
[34:48.060 --> 34:49.160]  And it was like,
[34:49.200 --> 34:50.360]  yeah, cool guy.
[34:51.260 --> 34:52.020]  Not a leader.
[34:52.020 --> 34:52.600]  Damn.
[34:52.760 --> 34:54.360]  Jansen Junk Rookie.
[34:54.500 --> 34:55.020]  That's a good name.
[34:55.100 --> 34:55.780]  That's a name as
[34:55.780 --> 34:56.900]  a career or...
[34:56.900 --> 34:56.960]  What?
[34:58.360 --> 34:58.900]  Junk guy.
[34:59.300 --> 34:59.840]  Or like...
[34:59.840 --> 35:00.140]  Junk collector.
[35:00.160 --> 35:01.880]  A name for a...
[35:01.880 --> 35:02.820]  I would just say
[35:02.820 --> 35:03.560]  like name as an object.
[35:03.840 --> 35:04.220]  Name as an object.
[35:04.340 --> 35:05.180]  Name as something interesting.
[35:05.440 --> 35:05.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[35:05.960 --> 35:06.740]  Like a body part.
[35:06.860 --> 35:07.880]  Yeah, maybe like not career,
[35:08.060 --> 35:08.540]  but yeah, you can do
[35:08.540 --> 35:09.000]  body part.
[35:09.240 --> 35:09.700]  It's pretty good.
[35:09.960 --> 35:11.340]  Well, you can be like
[35:11.340 --> 35:12.300]  in the Three Investigators,
[35:12.420 --> 35:12.980]  Jupiter Jones'
[35:13.160 --> 35:13.980]  grandparent, his aunt
[35:13.980 --> 35:14.620]  and his uncle owned
[35:14.620 --> 35:15.840]  a junkyard and they
[35:15.840 --> 35:16.520]  were salvaged people.
[35:16.560 --> 35:16.780]  Uh-huh.
[35:16.980 --> 35:17.140]  Yeah.
[35:17.860 --> 35:18.180]  Okay.
[35:18.620 --> 35:18.940]  Cool.
[35:19.820 --> 35:20.460]  Gabriel Arias.
[35:20.800 --> 35:21.620]  He looks like he
[35:21.620 --> 35:21.960]  doesn't want to
[35:21.960 --> 35:22.480]  take that picture.
[35:24.500 --> 35:25.140]  Kebryan Hayes.
[35:25.600 --> 35:26.060]  Come here.
[35:26.280 --> 35:26.820]  Yeah, please.
[35:26.920 --> 35:27.600]  Colton Wong,
[35:28.440 --> 35:28.760]  refractor.
[35:28.860 --> 35:29.240]  That's pretty.
[35:30.200 --> 35:31.620]  And then we have...
[35:31.620 --> 35:32.300]  Oh, speaking of,
[35:32.360 --> 35:32.780]  Mookie Betts.
[35:32.820 --> 35:33.160]  There you go.
[35:33.360 --> 35:33.680]  Yay.
[35:33.920 --> 35:34.740]  Happy to be a Dodger.
[35:35.260 --> 35:36.300]  He's very happy to be a Dodger.
[35:36.700 --> 35:37.120]  They put him in the
[35:37.120 --> 35:37.940]  infield and he was thrilled.
[35:38.180 --> 35:39.540]  He's the most likable dude.
[35:39.800 --> 35:40.420]  Yeah, he's...
[35:40.420 --> 35:40.760]  That's how we had
[35:40.760 --> 35:41.880]  38 home runs this year.
[35:42.240 --> 35:42.520]  Dang.
[35:42.680 --> 35:43.020]  I hate him.
[35:43.160 --> 35:43.520]  I hate him.
[35:43.520 --> 35:45.020]  If he played for any other team,
[35:45.120 --> 35:45.420]  he'd be...
[35:45.420 --> 35:46.120]  I'd be so happy.
[35:47.540 --> 35:48.420]  Miguel Seno.
[35:49.640 --> 35:50.520]  Riley Adams.
[35:51.780 --> 35:52.640]  Sleep that.
[35:53.560 --> 35:54.360]  Here we have
[35:54.360 --> 35:55.500]  Jim Bunning.
[35:57.400 --> 35:58.280]  And then...
[35:58.280 --> 35:59.320]  The old Phillies P.
[35:59.360 --> 35:59.860]  I like that.
[36:00.380 --> 36:01.240]  Vlad Jr.
[36:01.240 --> 36:01.740]  Vladdy Jr.
[36:03.220 --> 36:03.840]  He's almost
[36:03.840 --> 36:04.840]  the guy there.
[36:05.040 --> 36:05.860]  We're gonna put this pack
[36:05.860 --> 36:07.000]  into the pack sack.
[36:07.300 --> 36:08.420]  Otherwise, we need to feed that.
[36:08.960 --> 36:09.720]  I wonder if he'll go anywhere.
[36:09.800 --> 36:10.400]  I wonder if he'll just
[36:10.400 --> 36:11.980]  stick around the...
[36:11.980 --> 36:13.500]  keep being a blue jay.
[36:13.520 --> 36:14.600]  He seems happy there.
[36:14.900 --> 36:15.520]  You think so?
[36:15.640 --> 36:16.400]  Yeah, it seems like
[36:16.400 --> 36:17.260]  that's where all the kids
[36:17.260 --> 36:18.380]  from former players go.
[36:18.980 --> 36:19.940]  They've got a bunch of
[36:19.940 --> 36:21.220]  second generation guys
[36:21.220 --> 36:23.340]  that play in Toronto.
[36:23.560 --> 36:24.120]  And they seem really
[36:24.120 --> 36:24.640]  happy up there.
[36:25.300 --> 36:25.680]  I don't think there's
[36:25.680 --> 36:26.480]  probably a lot of pressure
[36:26.480 --> 36:27.260]  to perform in Toronto.
[36:27.680 --> 36:27.800]  You know?
[36:28.460 --> 36:28.820]  Let's open up
[36:28.820 --> 36:29.540]  a pack of Barbie cards.
[36:29.840 --> 36:30.200]  Hooray.
[36:30.800 --> 36:31.160]  Barbie.
[36:31.980 --> 36:33.140]  Another first for Barbie.
[36:33.720 --> 36:34.440]  English edition.
[36:35.320 --> 36:35.920]  Right, because
[36:36.520 --> 36:37.400]  they were printed...
[36:37.400 --> 36:38.020]  We have some at home
[36:38.020 --> 36:38.600]  that were printed
[36:38.600 --> 36:39.900]  in Canadian.
[36:40.060 --> 36:40.300]  They were printed
[36:40.300 --> 36:41.000]  in French, too.
[36:41.180 --> 36:41.480]  Really?
[36:41.480 --> 36:41.940]  Yeah.
[36:42.020 --> 36:42.500]  Gross.
[36:44.340 --> 36:44.580]  Whoa.
[36:45.320 --> 36:45.800]  What?
[36:45.880 --> 36:46.220]  There we go.
[36:46.240 --> 36:46.780]  It's just stuck.
[36:46.960 --> 36:47.620]  Alright, let's see
[36:47.620 --> 36:48.840]  what's up with...
[36:49.780 --> 36:50.740]  1984 Barbie.
[36:51.600 --> 36:51.640]  Wow.
[36:52.180 --> 36:54.660]  That's the dystopian
[36:54.660 --> 36:55.700]  George Orwell Barbie.
[36:57.160 --> 36:58.500]  Beware the savage lore.
[36:58.740 --> 36:59.160]  Ungood.
[36:59.300 --> 36:59.980]  I like her like
[36:59.980 --> 37:00.680]  Feather Boa.
[37:01.060 --> 37:02.620]  She's dressed
[37:02.620 --> 37:03.560]  double plus well.
[37:03.760 --> 37:04.640]  Yeah, this is a
[37:04.640 --> 37:05.960]  double plus good outfit.
[37:07.220 --> 37:08.320]  Barbie, 1985.
[37:09.120 --> 37:09.940]  I guess she survived.
[37:09.940 --> 37:10.480]  One of my friends
[37:10.480 --> 37:11.160]  had that bed,
[37:11.240 --> 37:12.220]  and I was so jealous.
[37:12.400 --> 37:12.600]  Oh, really?
[37:12.780 --> 37:13.740]  That seems like
[37:13.740 --> 37:14.680]  everything you're aiming
[37:14.680 --> 37:15.420]  for right there.
[37:15.640 --> 37:16.960]  Yes, it's all I want.
[37:17.820 --> 37:18.520]  There's another
[37:18.520 --> 37:19.220]  1985 Barbie.
[37:19.660 --> 37:20.400]  That's a very
[37:20.400 --> 37:21.080]  Sue Ellen outfit.
[37:21.080 --> 37:22.280]  This is like before...
[37:22.280 --> 37:23.220]  My Barbie didn't look
[37:23.220 --> 37:23.520]  like that.
[37:23.580 --> 37:24.560]  She has kind of
[37:24.560 --> 37:25.040]  the little bit
[37:25.040 --> 37:26.080]  older Barbie face.
[37:26.500 --> 37:27.280]  They changed
[37:27.280 --> 37:27.940]  her face around.
[37:27.980 --> 37:28.520]  She hadn't had
[37:28.520 --> 37:29.920]  80s Barbie Botox yet?
[37:30.040 --> 37:30.220]  Yeah.
[37:31.360 --> 37:32.240]  89 Barbie.
[37:32.420 --> 37:33.960]  Wow, that's awesome.
[37:34.700 --> 37:35.380]  That's so cool.
[37:35.380 --> 37:35.900]  She looks so good.
[37:35.900 --> 37:36.400]  Look at her little
[37:36.400 --> 37:37.020]  knee bend.
[37:37.600 --> 37:38.900]  That's what the 80s
[37:38.900 --> 37:40.200]  look like in my head.
[37:40.860 --> 37:41.720]  It's the hair
[37:41.720 --> 37:42.620]  with the purple
[37:42.620 --> 37:43.480]  to pink.
[37:44.400 --> 37:44.940]  That's a good one.
[37:45.080 --> 37:45.560]  That's so good.
[37:45.820 --> 37:46.700]  I'm gonna save that one.
[37:46.800 --> 37:47.180]  Yeah, I agree.
[37:47.300 --> 37:48.100]  That one's just for you.
[37:48.380 --> 37:48.480]  She looks so good.
[37:49.060 --> 37:49.760]  1990s Barbie.
[37:50.020 --> 37:50.300]  Uh-huh.
[37:50.780 --> 37:51.740]  There you go.
[37:52.440 --> 37:53.260]  1989 Barbie
[37:53.260 --> 37:54.060]  in a different outfit.
[37:54.140 --> 37:55.240]  A little more formal.
[37:55.280 --> 37:55.740]  She's gonna do
[37:55.740 --> 37:56.480]  a karate chop.
[37:56.580 --> 37:56.720]  Yeah.
[37:56.960 --> 37:58.340]  And then unexpected
[37:58.340 --> 37:58.780]  karate.
[37:59.400 --> 38:00.060]  Save that.
[38:00.500 --> 38:01.900]  It's a new...
[38:02.420 --> 38:02.760]  Great.
[38:03.980 --> 38:04.860]  1990 Barbie...
[38:04.860 --> 38:05.600]  I have that dress!
[38:05.920 --> 38:06.320]  Oh my God,
[38:06.320 --> 38:07.040]  I don't have my Barbie
[38:07.040 --> 38:07.800]  with me!
[38:07.800 --> 38:09.560]  It's in my car,
[38:09.700 --> 38:10.460]  but this is the dress
[38:10.460 --> 38:11.260]  that I have on my weird
[38:11.260 --> 38:12.280]  Barbie right now.
[38:12.560 --> 38:13.000]  Ah!
[38:13.940 --> 38:14.980]  Wow, it looks so much
[38:14.980 --> 38:15.140]  better in this.
[38:15.140 --> 38:16.300]  Is that your Jasper Barbie?
[38:16.500 --> 38:17.620]  Yeah, that's in my Jasper.
[38:17.620 --> 38:18.780]  I don't have it with me.
[38:18.820 --> 38:19.600]  It looks so much better
[38:19.600 --> 38:20.240]  new than it does
[38:20.240 --> 38:20.980]  on my weird Barbie.
[38:21.380 --> 38:22.120]  Oh, man.
[38:22.760 --> 38:22.840]  Here we have
[38:22.840 --> 38:23.920]  1989 Barbie again.
[38:24.020 --> 38:25.400]  This is my first Barbie.
[38:25.700 --> 38:26.600]  The most beautiful
[38:26.600 --> 38:27.800]  princess of all time
[38:27.800 --> 38:28.900]  will delight her subjects.
[38:29.180 --> 38:30.200]  Barbie's gown is really
[38:30.200 --> 38:30.920]  that of a princess
[38:30.920 --> 38:31.800]  with its shiny
[38:31.800 --> 38:32.640]  fuchsia bodice,
[38:33.060 --> 38:33.660]  puffed sleeves,
[38:34.340 --> 38:34.780]  and...
[38:35.520 --> 38:36.400]  organdy skirt?
[38:36.680 --> 38:36.860]  What?
[38:36.860 --> 38:37.960]  With velvety patterns
[38:37.960 --> 38:38.460]  and hues.
[38:38.620 --> 38:38.980]  She's wearing
[38:38.980 --> 38:40.280]  a magnificent crown
[38:40.280 --> 38:41.620]  and holding a chiffon
[38:41.620 --> 38:42.300]  rose in her hands.
[38:42.460 --> 38:43.540]  Her shoes are white.
[38:44.680 --> 38:45.500]  Barbie facts.
[38:45.920 --> 38:46.940]  The bathing suits
[38:46.940 --> 38:47.940]  of dolls in the
[38:47.940 --> 38:49.020]  Wet and Wild collection
[38:49.020 --> 38:49.840]  change color
[38:49.840 --> 38:50.440]  when submerged
[38:50.440 --> 38:51.280]  in cold water.
[38:51.420 --> 38:51.720]  They return
[38:51.720 --> 38:52.760]  to their original color
[38:52.760 --> 38:53.160]  when dry.
[38:53.420 --> 38:54.220]  Fun facts.
[38:54.840 --> 38:55.860]  The television series
[38:55.860 --> 38:56.380]  The Simpsons,
[38:56.540 --> 38:57.640]  originally a comic strip,
[38:57.800 --> 38:58.820]  is one of the 10
[38:58.820 --> 38:59.700]  most popular shows
[38:59.700 --> 39:00.400]  on TV today.
[39:00.540 --> 39:01.120]  It doesn't have
[39:01.120 --> 39:01.780]  anything to do
[39:01.780 --> 39:02.840]  with the fun facts.
[39:02.960 --> 39:04.020]  That is a fun fact.
[39:04.020 --> 39:05.420]  It's just a fact.
[39:05.440 --> 39:06.120]  The one time
[39:06.120 --> 39:06.660]  I got a hit
[39:06.660 --> 39:06.980]  and I didn't have
[39:06.980 --> 39:07.980]  my Barbies.
[39:08.120 --> 39:08.420]  It's tough.
[39:10.440 --> 39:11.400]  What are these?
[39:12.100 --> 39:12.980]  28 cards?
[39:13.260 --> 39:13.440]  Yeah,
[39:13.560 --> 39:14.080]  these are
[39:15.480 --> 39:16.360]  1985 tops.
[39:16.520 --> 39:16.840]  Wow.
[39:17.240 --> 39:17.900]  These are
[39:17.900 --> 39:18.660]  some kind of
[39:18.660 --> 39:19.080]  fat pack
[39:19.080 --> 39:19.700]  they would sell.
[39:19.940 --> 39:20.720]  I did pay $15
[39:20.720 --> 39:21.460]  for this at the
[39:21.820 --> 39:22.260]  card shop.
[39:22.540 --> 39:23.040]  But you can
[39:23.040 --> 39:24.180]  get a
[39:24.180 --> 39:24.680]  Maguire
[39:27.020 --> 39:27.900]  Olympic rookie.
[39:28.520 --> 39:29.400]  Bud Black.
[39:29.720 --> 39:30.800]  I have one already.
[39:30.820 --> 39:31.040]  Really?
[39:31.120 --> 39:31.620]  Bud Black?
[39:31.900 --> 39:32.620]  That's the manager
[39:32.620 --> 39:33.360]  for the Rockies.
[39:33.360 --> 39:34.600]  Former Padres
[39:34.600 --> 39:34.840]  manager.
[39:36.180 --> 39:37.100]  Scott Sanderson.
[39:38.640 --> 39:39.600]  Scott Sanderson.
[39:39.800 --> 39:40.740]  Andre Thornton.
[39:40.840 --> 39:41.400]  This is back
[39:41.400 --> 39:42.220]  when jerseys looked
[39:42.220 --> 39:42.960]  really good.
[39:43.100 --> 39:43.660]  Because it was the
[39:43.660 --> 39:44.740]  pullover and not
[39:44.740 --> 39:45.660]  everything's buttoned
[39:45.660 --> 39:46.140]  down now.
[39:46.260 --> 39:46.980]  And it sucks.
[39:47.200 --> 39:47.940]  The pullover is
[39:47.940 --> 39:48.920]  like the look, man.
[39:49.200 --> 39:49.920]  Cliff Johnson.
[39:51.100 --> 39:51.380]  Dang.
[39:51.560 --> 39:52.580]  Barry Bunnell.
[39:52.820 --> 39:53.280]  Hey, Mount
[39:53.280 --> 39:53.500]  Bunnell.
[39:53.800 --> 39:54.340]  Oh yeah.
[39:55.020 --> 39:56.300]  That's a hyper
[39:56.300 --> 39:56.940]  specific one.
[39:56.980 --> 39:57.500]  Name is a place
[39:57.500 --> 39:57.820]  in Austin.
[39:58.020 --> 39:58.360]  What's
[39:58.360 --> 39:59.260]  with his nostril?
[39:59.260 --> 40:00.620]  It's flaring, baby.
[40:01.180 --> 40:01.820]  That's like as
[40:01.820 --> 40:02.560]  big as his eye.
[40:02.660 --> 40:03.300]  Maybe we'll have a
[40:03.300 --> 40:03.860]  team flare.
[40:04.280 --> 40:04.640]  Yeah.
[40:06.300 --> 40:06.720]  Damn.
[40:07.000 --> 40:07.460]  Darryl Porter.
[40:09.200 --> 40:10.100]  He's got nostrils
[40:10.100 --> 40:10.660]  like Gavin.
[40:10.800 --> 40:11.120]  God.
[40:12.000 --> 40:12.840]  Sid Fernandez.
[40:13.920 --> 40:14.580]  Ooh, Jesse
[40:14.580 --> 40:15.100]  Barfield.
[40:15.260 --> 40:15.640]  I liked Jesse
[40:15.640 --> 40:16.100]  Barfield a lot
[40:16.100 --> 40:16.620]  when I was a kid.
[40:17.120 --> 40:17.720]  Julio Franco.
[40:17.960 --> 40:18.460]  I was a big Julio
[40:18.460 --> 40:19.100]  Franco fan when I
[40:19.100 --> 40:19.580]  was a kid, too.
[40:19.680 --> 40:20.720]  Aw, good smile.
[40:20.960 --> 40:21.320]  Rich Dower.
[40:21.760 --> 40:22.740]  Julio Franco's got a
[40:22.740 --> 40:23.160]  winning, how about
[40:23.160 --> 40:23.800]  winning smile?
[40:24.040 --> 40:24.560]  Winning smile.
[40:25.540 --> 40:26.420]  Brian Downing.
[40:28.340 --> 40:29.100]  Isn't that, Brian
[40:29.100 --> 40:29.860]  Downing, isn't that
[40:29.860 --> 40:30.800]  where the prime
[40:30.800 --> 40:31.960]  minister works?
[40:32.180 --> 40:32.300]  Yeah.
[40:32.900 --> 40:33.260]  Downing Street.
[40:33.920 --> 40:34.720]  Bruce Benedict.
[40:35.560 --> 40:36.440]  That's a breakfast.
[40:37.080 --> 40:37.380]  That's a food.
[40:37.380 --> 40:37.800]  Eggs Benedict.
[40:37.960 --> 40:38.400]  Eggs Benedict.
[40:40.480 --> 40:41.360]  Garth Iorg.
[40:42.060 --> 40:42.440]  Wow.
[40:42.740 --> 40:43.260]  The fuck is that?
[40:43.340 --> 40:43.880]  Dude, that's like
[40:43.880 --> 40:44.700]  not even a name.
[40:44.880 --> 40:45.500]  It's a bunch of
[40:45.500 --> 40:45.700]  letters.
[40:46.640 --> 40:47.500]  There's a bunch of
[40:47.500 --> 40:48.140]  letters on there.
[40:49.660 --> 40:50.540]  Alex Trevino.
[40:53.920 --> 40:54.780]  If you want to
[40:54.780 --> 40:55.500]  play this game, you
[40:55.500 --> 40:56.220]  gotta fucking mail
[40:56.220 --> 40:56.800]  it in, apparently.
[40:58.280 --> 40:58.920]  Craig Lefferts.
[40:59.100 --> 40:59.420]  We should.
[40:59.900 --> 41:00.220]  We should.
[41:00.380 --> 41:00.800]  Love that old
[41:00.800 --> 41:01.400]  Padres hat.
[41:01.560 --> 41:02.220]  Let's mail that in
[41:02.220 --> 41:03.160]  off episode.
[41:04.240 --> 41:05.060]  Oh, God, I don't
[41:05.060 --> 41:05.700]  know where we put
[41:05.700 --> 41:06.400]  this, but I think
[41:06.400 --> 41:07.320]  Joey McLaughlin
[41:07.320 --> 41:08.840]  belongs in one of
[41:08.840 --> 41:08.860]  our...
[41:08.860 --> 41:09.620]  That's step-dads,
[41:09.640 --> 41:09.820]  right?
[41:09.840 --> 41:10.120]  Step-dads, right.
[41:10.120 --> 41:10.520]  Didn't we have
[41:10.520 --> 41:11.200]  a step-dad's file?
[41:11.220 --> 41:11.340]  Daddy stepped
[41:11.340 --> 41:11.900]  up, his dad
[41:11.900 --> 41:12.040]  stepped up.
[41:12.220 --> 41:12.900]  Do you think that
[41:12.900 --> 41:13.760]  he stepped up or
[41:13.760 --> 41:14.900]  that he's like...
[41:14.900 --> 41:15.680]  He might be a dad
[41:15.680 --> 41:16.220]  who got stepped
[41:16.220 --> 41:16.600]  on.
[41:16.800 --> 41:17.200]  What?
[41:17.920 --> 41:18.540]  What's up?
[41:18.620 --> 41:19.220]  Dwight Gooden?
[41:19.400 --> 41:19.840]  Okay.
[41:21.500 --> 41:22.260]  Mark McGuire,
[41:22.360 --> 41:22.840]  United States...
[41:22.840 --> 41:23.500]  No way!
[41:24.380 --> 41:25.080]  Legitimate fucking
[41:25.080 --> 41:25.340]  hit.
[41:25.580 --> 41:25.940]  Wait!
[41:26.000 --> 41:26.380]  Is that good?
[41:26.400 --> 41:27.040]  That's the card
[41:27.040 --> 41:27.760]  that you said you
[41:27.760 --> 41:28.460]  could get in this
[41:28.460 --> 41:28.860]  patch.
[41:28.920 --> 41:29.680]  That's the card to
[41:29.680 --> 41:29.920]  get.
[41:30.140 --> 41:31.020]  It's the McGuire
[41:31.020 --> 41:31.960]  Olympic card.
[41:32.680 --> 41:33.820]  I don't even know
[41:33.820 --> 41:34.600]  what this runs at
[41:34.600 --> 41:35.220]  PSA 10.
[41:35.300 --> 41:35.820]  This wouldn't be
[41:35.820 --> 41:36.240]  a 10.
[41:36.460 --> 41:36.640]  Why?
[41:36.880 --> 41:37.860]  This corner's a
[41:37.860 --> 41:38.860]  little soft, but
[41:38.860 --> 41:39.800]  the centering is
[41:39.800 --> 41:40.820]  really good on
[41:40.820 --> 41:41.120]  it.
[41:41.660 --> 41:42.760]  It's probably a
[41:42.760 --> 41:43.140]  9.
[41:43.240 --> 41:43.620]  You better sleeve
[41:43.620 --> 41:44.220]  the fuck out of
[41:44.220 --> 41:44.580]  this thing.
[41:44.840 --> 41:45.620]  This is a 10.
[41:45.780 --> 41:46.840]  It's a little bit
[41:46.840 --> 41:47.100]  of money.
[41:47.360 --> 41:47.980]  So let's sleeve
[41:47.980 --> 41:48.480]  and then...
[41:48.480 --> 41:49.200]  Do you have one
[41:49.200 --> 41:49.640]  of the hard
[41:49.640 --> 41:50.100]  sleeves?
[41:53.100 --> 41:54.140]  Good job, Mike.
[41:54.320 --> 41:54.900]  I can't believe
[41:54.900 --> 41:55.600]  you actually got
[41:55.600 --> 41:56.300]  the card that you
[41:56.300 --> 41:56.920]  said here's the
[41:56.920 --> 41:57.480]  thing to get.
[41:57.580 --> 41:58.040]  It never
[41:58.040 --> 41:58.440]  happens.
[41:58.640 --> 41:58.980]  That never
[41:58.980 --> 41:59.720]  happens on this
[41:59.720 --> 41:59.960]  show.
[42:00.040 --> 42:00.840]  He looks so
[42:00.840 --> 42:01.760]  different before
[42:02.420 --> 42:03.320]  playing more
[42:03.320 --> 42:04.420]  games and
[42:04.420 --> 42:04.860]  getting more
[42:04.860 --> 42:05.200]  muscles.
[42:06.060 --> 42:07.620]  Before he put
[42:07.620 --> 42:08.060]  on a lot of
[42:08.060 --> 42:08.560]  hard work at the
[42:08.560 --> 42:08.760]  gym.
[42:09.440 --> 42:09.940]  JTibbs.
[42:09.960 --> 42:10.600]  He looks so
[42:10.600 --> 42:11.420]  different before
[42:11.420 --> 42:12.200]  playing more
[42:12.200 --> 42:12.600]  games.
[42:13.100 --> 42:13.900]  Frank Williams.
[42:14.040 --> 42:14.840]  That's probably the
[42:14.840 --> 42:15.840]  best card you can
[42:15.840 --> 42:16.300]  get out of this
[42:16.300 --> 42:16.560]  set.
[42:16.640 --> 42:17.180]  Yeah, that's
[42:17.180 --> 42:17.800]  really impressive.
[42:18.120 --> 42:19.880]  Julio Solano.
[42:21.420 --> 42:22.420]  Geoff Cornell.
[42:23.300 --> 42:24.300]  Steve Yeager.
[42:24.720 --> 42:25.080]  Oda B.
[42:25.380 --> 42:26.240]  McDowell Olympic
[42:26.240 --> 42:26.640]  team.
[42:26.720 --> 42:26.980]  We'll go ahead
[42:26.980 --> 42:27.540]  and sleeve that
[42:27.540 --> 42:27.820]  too.
[42:28.860 --> 42:29.800]  Doug Rader
[42:29.800 --> 42:30.640]  manager card.
[42:30.740 --> 42:31.240]  We sleeve all
[42:31.240 --> 42:32.040]  manager cards I've
[42:32.040 --> 42:32.360]  decided.
[42:33.340 --> 42:34.380]  Pete Vukovich.
[42:36.100 --> 42:37.440]  That's a name, a
[42:37.440 --> 42:38.660]  hair, and a...
[42:38.660 --> 42:39.740]  That's all in one.
[42:39.740 --> 42:41.020]  That's a mustache
[42:41.020 --> 42:41.420]  too.
[42:41.640 --> 42:42.460]  You know what?
[42:42.500 --> 42:43.200]  That's not a
[42:43.200 --> 42:43.520]  stepdad.
[42:43.580 --> 42:44.380]  That's your dad.
[42:45.120 --> 42:46.160]  That's a real
[42:46.160 --> 42:46.840]  damn dad.
[42:47.240 --> 42:48.140]  He's had a few
[42:48.140 --> 42:48.840]  beers and you're
[42:48.840 --> 42:50.460]  like, oh shit.
[42:50.800 --> 42:51.160]  You know, but
[42:51.160 --> 42:52.480]  like, yeah.
[42:52.740 --> 42:53.240]  That's your
[42:53.240 --> 42:54.200]  friend's dad who
[42:54.200 --> 42:55.000]  can be kind of
[42:55.000 --> 42:55.180]  mean.
[42:55.320 --> 42:56.040]  That guy smokes.
[42:56.780 --> 42:57.600]  In the house.
[42:59.880 --> 43:01.320]  Laying in bed, he smokes.
[43:01.800 --> 43:03.920]  Should we have smokes
[43:03.920 --> 43:04.340]  in bed?
[43:04.480 --> 43:05.120]  Yeah, absolutely.
[43:06.460 --> 43:07.620]  Like, big time.
[43:07.720 --> 43:08.060]  Oh, yeah.
[43:08.260 --> 43:08.940]  Leon Durant.
[43:09.000 --> 43:09.780]  Man, that was so
[43:09.780 --> 43:10.640]  much fun to open.
[43:10.720 --> 43:11.000]  I'm going to go
[43:11.000 --> 43:11.660]  back and buy more
[43:11.660 --> 43:11.840]  of those.
[43:12.620 --> 43:12.980]  Awesome.
[43:13.960 --> 43:14.860]  You got the best
[43:14.860 --> 43:15.420]  card that you can
[43:15.420 --> 43:15.620]  get.
[43:15.660 --> 43:16.120]  Why would you get
[43:16.120 --> 43:16.400]  more?
[43:16.640 --> 43:17.200]  Yeah, that's true.
[43:17.280 --> 43:17.780]  They're fun to open
[43:17.780 --> 43:17.940]  though.
[43:18.000 --> 43:18.280]  Wow.
[43:18.480 --> 43:19.180]  How much did
[43:19.180 --> 43:20.280]  Mark McGuire weigh
[43:20.280 --> 43:21.700]  at his highest wall
[43:21.700 --> 43:22.320]  plane?
[43:23.680 --> 43:24.040]  240?
[43:24.800 --> 43:25.520]  Yeah, probably.
[43:25.540 --> 43:26.160]  He said he's only
[43:26.160 --> 43:27.080]  220 in this.
[43:27.400 --> 43:27.900]  Yeah, that's because
[43:27.900 --> 43:28.740]  he's 185.
[43:29.680 --> 43:30.080]  Yeah.
[43:30.340 --> 43:31.260]  And that he's 65.
[43:31.900 --> 43:32.480]  Yeah, he's a big dude.
[43:32.540 --> 43:33.320]  His brother, Dan
[43:33.320 --> 43:35.100]  McGuire, was 67?
[43:35.580 --> 43:36.160]  Something like that,
[43:36.220 --> 43:36.280]  yeah.
[43:36.300 --> 43:37.240]  And played, very
[43:37.240 --> 43:37.820]  briefly, he was a
[43:37.820 --> 43:38.140]  quarterback.
[43:38.320 --> 43:38.880]  I think he played
[43:38.880 --> 43:40.300]  one year in the NFL.
[43:40.660 --> 43:42.280]  But he's a big guy,
[43:42.580 --> 43:43.500]  like, all kind of
[43:43.500 --> 43:44.780]  size-wise, and that
[43:45.620 --> 43:46.280]  weight is not
[43:46.280 --> 43:46.600]  accurate.
[43:46.720 --> 43:47.680]  He was, like...
[43:47.680 --> 43:48.680]  The bat looks so
[43:48.680 --> 43:49.980]  little in his hands,
[43:50.120 --> 43:50.320]  too.
[43:50.640 --> 43:51.280]  He was small.
[43:51.360 --> 43:51.800]  In that early
[43:51.800 --> 43:52.480]  career, like, the
[43:52.480 --> 43:53.020]  early run of his
[43:53.020 --> 43:53.540]  career, he was a
[43:53.540 --> 43:54.200]  power hitter, but,
[43:54.320 --> 43:55.400]  like, he was not
[43:55.400 --> 43:55.680]  big.
[43:55.960 --> 43:56.100]  Yeah.
[43:56.520 --> 43:57.340]  Man, I'm so excited
[43:57.340 --> 43:58.040]  for you to look up
[43:58.040 --> 43:59.060]  what you might get
[43:59.060 --> 43:59.420]  for that.
[43:59.540 --> 43:59.860]  The value?
[44:00.020 --> 44:00.280]  Yeah.
[44:00.720 --> 44:01.420]  And it's funny,
[44:01.500 --> 44:02.360]  because that was
[44:02.360 --> 44:03.200]  one of the...
[44:03.200 --> 44:04.040]  When I was a kid
[44:04.040 --> 44:04.820]  in the 80s, there
[44:04.820 --> 44:05.380]  were four or five
[44:05.380 --> 44:05.900]  chase cards.
[44:06.120 --> 44:07.340]  This was right up
[44:07.340 --> 44:07.540]  there.
[44:07.760 --> 44:08.480]  I never had it.
[44:08.580 --> 44:09.740]  So I bought it
[44:09.740 --> 44:10.800]  when we were in
[44:10.800 --> 44:12.540]  Michigan at, like,
[44:12.560 --> 44:13.320]  an antique store.
[44:13.460 --> 44:14.320]  I bought it three
[44:14.320 --> 44:14.900]  years ago.
[44:14.980 --> 44:16.000]  Oh, three years ago.
[44:16.180 --> 44:17.060]  And then...
[44:17.060 --> 44:17.660]  So I've had it
[44:17.660 --> 44:18.160]  this whole time.
[44:18.300 --> 44:18.660]  Oh, wow.
[44:18.700 --> 44:19.300]  It's totally
[44:19.300 --> 44:20.180]  different to pull it.
[44:20.340 --> 44:20.980]  Totally different
[44:20.980 --> 44:21.680]  experience to pull it.
[44:21.800 --> 44:22.100]  That's awesome.
[44:22.120 --> 44:22.740]  I'm so glad we got
[44:22.740 --> 44:23.440]  to experience that
[44:23.440 --> 44:23.780]  with you.
[44:24.180 --> 44:25.340]  And then I recently
[44:25.340 --> 44:26.120]  discovered something,
[44:26.240 --> 44:26.740]  a new kind of
[44:26.740 --> 44:27.960]  collectible that I'm
[44:27.960 --> 44:28.640]  really excited about
[44:28.640 --> 44:29.100]  that I wanted to
[44:29.100 --> 44:30.820]  show you guys that I
[44:30.820 --> 44:31.420]  think maybe is an
[44:31.420 --> 44:32.000]  area we could get
[44:32.000 --> 44:32.180]  into.
[44:32.280 --> 44:32.700]  I don't think they
[44:32.700 --> 44:34.940]  still make it, but I
[44:34.940 --> 44:35.880]  just learned about,
[44:36.000 --> 44:37.600]  on Tiki Talk, I
[44:37.600 --> 44:38.140]  learned about this
[44:38.140 --> 44:38.980]  thing called
[44:40.200 --> 44:40.520]  Celebriducks.
[44:41.160 --> 44:41.560]  Are you guys
[44:41.560 --> 44:42.440]  familiar with...
[44:42.440 --> 44:44.120]  You got a Lamar
[44:44.120 --> 44:45.260]  Odom Celebriduck?
[44:45.660 --> 44:46.060]  Celebriduck.
[44:46.220 --> 44:47.400]  I had to pay like
[44:47.400 --> 44:48.880]  25 bucks for this
[44:48.880 --> 44:49.060]  thing.
[44:49.240 --> 44:49.800]  That sucks.
[44:49.860 --> 44:50.340]  And I bought
[44:50.340 --> 44:51.160]  Lamar Odom because it
[44:51.160 --> 44:51.820]  was literally the
[44:51.820 --> 44:52.620]  cheapest one they
[44:52.620 --> 44:52.840]  sold.
[44:53.020 --> 44:53.880]  Lamar Odom is the
[44:53.880 --> 44:54.840]  worst one to get.
[44:55.000 --> 44:55.760]  The Allen Iverson
[44:55.760 --> 44:56.220]  one was very
[44:56.220 --> 44:56.580]  expensive.
[44:57.740 --> 44:58.540]  Clippers Lamar
[44:58.540 --> 44:59.280]  Odom Celebriduck.
[44:59.280 --> 44:59.660]  Yeah, you don't
[44:59.660 --> 45:00.240]  even get Lakers
[45:00.240 --> 45:00.800]  Lamar Odom.
[45:01.840 --> 45:04.020]  So anyway, if you're
[45:04.020 --> 45:05.080]  into Celebriducks,
[45:05.140 --> 45:05.620]  let me know.
[45:05.720 --> 45:06.260]  I think we could
[45:06.260 --> 45:06.840]  start our...
[45:06.840 --> 45:07.960]  He'll go up there
[45:07.960 --> 45:08.340]  somewhere.
[45:08.500 --> 45:09.040]  We'll have a little
[45:09.040 --> 45:09.620]  Celebriduck.
[45:09.900 --> 45:11.100]  There's a museum of
[45:11.100 --> 45:11.640]  Celebriducks.
[45:12.120 --> 45:12.420]  Disgusting.
[45:12.700 --> 45:13.280]  Where was it?
[45:13.400 --> 45:14.080]  It was in Connecticut
[45:14.080 --> 45:14.540]  or something?
[45:14.780 --> 45:15.100]  Somewhere like that.
[45:15.200 --> 45:15.400]  Yeah.
[45:15.800 --> 45:16.380]  Somewhere where
[45:16.380 --> 45:16.960]  there's nothing else
[45:16.960 --> 45:18.200]  to do but collect
[45:18.200 --> 45:18.940]  Celebriducks.
[45:19.100 --> 45:19.720]  But it's going to
[45:19.720 --> 45:20.400]  get us there.
[45:20.880 --> 45:21.760]  Fucking cool, I'll
[45:21.760 --> 45:22.100]  tell you that.
[45:22.140 --> 45:22.700]  It's disgusting.
[45:23.840 --> 45:24.480]  We're going to end
[45:24.480 --> 45:25.180]  on these Lorikana
[45:25.180 --> 45:26.300]  cards, so just tease
[45:26.300 --> 45:26.780]  that a little bit.
[45:26.780 --> 45:27.720]  In the meantime...
[45:27.720 --> 45:28.000]  About ten more
[45:28.000 --> 45:28.540]  minutes we'll have
[45:30.300 --> 45:31.180]  Lorikana, which I
[45:31.180 --> 45:31.940]  just heard about last
[45:31.940 --> 45:32.120]  week.
[45:32.720 --> 45:33.600]  NBA Basketball
[45:33.600 --> 45:34.160]  Upper Deck.
[45:34.360 --> 45:34.620]  What year?
[45:35.060 --> 45:36.480]  91-92 edition.
[45:36.700 --> 45:37.900]  I bought this in
[45:37.900 --> 45:39.360]  Marine City, Michigan.
[45:39.580 --> 45:39.980]  Yeah.
[45:40.340 --> 45:41.000]  When we were on
[45:41.000 --> 45:41.820]  vacation this summer.
[45:42.520 --> 45:42.680]  Shout out
[45:42.680 --> 45:43.020]  Little Indian
[45:43.020 --> 45:43.060]  Store.
[45:43.060 --> 45:43.480]  Bad Boys
[45:43.480 --> 45:44.040]  Pistons.
[45:46.040 --> 45:47.480]  Let's see what we
[45:47.480 --> 45:47.760]  get.
[45:47.860 --> 45:48.960]  We get Kendall
[45:48.960 --> 45:49.440]  Gill.
[45:50.220 --> 45:51.600]  We have Rick
[45:51.600 --> 45:52.700]  Mahorn.
[45:53.680 --> 45:54.660]  We have Rich
[45:54.660 --> 45:54.960]  King.
[45:56.840 --> 45:57.220]  Great name.
[45:57.260 --> 45:59.060]  Lance Blanks.
[45:59.760 --> 46:00.180]  Oh, Ronnie
[46:00.180 --> 46:00.540]  Cycli.
[46:01.700 --> 46:01.920]  Vinnie
[46:01.920 --> 46:02.920]  the Microwave
[46:02.920 --> 46:03.340]  Johnson.
[46:03.480 --> 46:03.840]  There you go.
[46:03.920 --> 46:04.880]  There's a bad
[46:04.880 --> 46:05.440]  boy for you.
[46:05.520 --> 46:05.760]  Now he's
[46:05.760 --> 46:06.020]  cooking.
[46:06.160 --> 46:06.660]  Dude, they
[46:06.660 --> 46:07.200]  called this guy
[46:07.700 --> 46:08.780]  Vinnie the Microwave
[46:08.780 --> 46:09.500]  Johnson because he
[46:09.500 --> 46:10.280]  heated up so fast.
[46:10.720 --> 46:11.040]  He was like a
[46:11.040 --> 46:11.320]  microwave.
[46:11.540 --> 46:12.400]  He heated up from
[46:12.400 --> 46:12.880]  the inside out.
[46:12.940 --> 46:13.700]  He played off the
[46:13.700 --> 46:13.900]  bench.
[46:14.040 --> 46:14.700]  He was like their
[46:14.700 --> 46:15.180]  sixth man.
[46:15.300 --> 46:16.060]  He was fucking
[46:16.060 --> 46:16.620]  awesome.
[46:16.880 --> 46:17.420]  Really cool dude.
[46:17.760 --> 46:18.640]  Kevin Willis.
[46:19.240 --> 46:19.680]  Another great
[46:19.680 --> 46:20.120]  player.
[46:21.000 --> 46:21.620]  Here we have
[46:21.620 --> 46:22.760]  John Consack.
[46:24.320 --> 46:25.080]  Probably the most
[46:25.080 --> 46:25.660]  he ever did in the
[46:25.660 --> 46:27.000]  NBA was to die for
[46:27.000 --> 46:27.340]  that ball.
[46:28.500 --> 46:28.880]  Randolph
[46:29.800 --> 46:30.320]  Keyes.
[46:31.740 --> 46:32.260]  Anthony
[46:32.260 --> 46:33.220]  Bonner.
[46:33.820 --> 46:34.760]  His name is a
[46:34.760 --> 46:35.280]  body part.
[46:37.320 --> 46:37.840]  Travis
[46:37.840 --> 46:38.460]  Mays.
[46:38.820 --> 46:40.040]  Kind of a
[46:40.040 --> 46:40.440]  ballerina
[46:40.440 --> 46:40.960]  situation.
[46:41.220 --> 46:41.540]  Buck
[46:41.540 --> 46:42.260]  Johnson.
[46:42.380 --> 46:42.740]  That's pretty
[46:42.740 --> 46:43.020]  good, too.
[46:43.060 --> 46:43.520]  Oh, it is
[46:43.900 --> 46:44.160]  ballerina.
[46:45.500 --> 46:46.020]  Sleep
[46:46.020 --> 46:46.600]  that sucker.
[46:46.980 --> 46:47.280]  I really
[46:47.280 --> 46:48.540]  recommend, if
[46:48.540 --> 46:49.180]  you're not a Celtics
[46:49.180 --> 46:49.640]  fan, I really
[46:49.640 --> 46:50.280]  recommend Winning
[46:50.280 --> 46:50.480]  Time.
[46:51.360 --> 46:52.080]  Great show.
[46:52.080 --> 46:53.160]  Yeah, Emily's
[46:53.160 --> 46:53.900]  dad keeps trying to
[46:53.900 --> 46:54.460]  get me...
[46:54.460 --> 46:55.100]  Yeah, no, you
[46:55.100 --> 46:56.380]  shouldn't watch it.
[46:56.780 --> 46:57.200]  Is it because they
[46:57.200 --> 46:57.800]  just dunk on the
[46:57.800 --> 46:58.340]  Celtics all the
[46:58.340 --> 46:58.500]  time?
[46:58.620 --> 46:59.740]  Oh, they are...
[46:59.740 --> 47:00.320]  Which is funny
[47:00.320 --> 47:01.180]  because historically
[47:01.180 --> 47:01.800]  the Celtics have
[47:01.800 --> 47:02.220]  dunked on the
[47:02.220 --> 47:03.880]  Lakers over, and
[47:03.880 --> 47:06.340]  over, and over, and
[47:06.340 --> 47:08.980]  over, and over, and
[47:08.980 --> 47:12.080]  over, and over, and
[47:12.080 --> 47:14.160]  over, and over, and
[47:14.160 --> 47:17.700]  over, and over, and
[47:17.700 --> 47:19.420]  over, and over, and
[47:19.420 --> 47:19.440]  over, and over, and
[47:19.600 --> 47:20.520]  Twelve times?
[47:20.540 --> 47:20.880]  Seventeen
[47:20.880 --> 47:21.180]  times.
[47:21.220 --> 47:21.360]  Yeah.
[47:21.720 --> 47:22.060]  It's
[47:22.060 --> 47:22.180]  so funny.
[47:22.180 --> 47:22.600]  It is...
[47:23.780 --> 47:25.360]  It is so...
[47:25.360 --> 47:26.860]  It's so fun, the
[47:26.860 --> 47:27.680]  way that team is...
[47:27.680 --> 47:28.220]  Like, the Showtime
[47:28.220 --> 47:29.040]  Lakers are portrayed,
[47:29.180 --> 47:30.040]  but it's way
[47:30.040 --> 47:30.800]  funnier about how
[47:30.800 --> 47:31.360]  the Celtics are
[47:31.360 --> 47:31.580]  portrayed.
[47:31.940 --> 47:32.500]  We were talking
[47:32.500 --> 47:33.140]  about it when we
[47:33.140 --> 47:33.700]  did Animalist
[47:33.700 --> 47:34.360]  last week, and I
[47:34.360 --> 47:34.820]  was like, I think
[47:34.820 --> 47:35.260]  the only way you
[47:35.260 --> 47:35.680]  can make them
[47:35.680 --> 47:36.360]  bigger villains is
[47:36.360 --> 47:36.920]  if Larry Bird
[47:36.920 --> 47:37.780]  kicked a dog on
[47:37.780 --> 47:38.240]  his way to the
[47:38.660 --> 47:39.460]  basketball court.
[47:39.780 --> 47:40.800]  It is so
[47:40.800 --> 47:41.720]  fucking funny.
[47:42.040 --> 47:42.660]  It's the best.
[47:43.400 --> 47:44.300]  All right, 1990
[47:44.300 --> 47:44.720]  Tops.
[47:44.760 --> 47:45.220]  We're looking for
[47:45.220 --> 47:45.860]  Don Zimmers.
[47:46.000 --> 47:46.440]  Wee!
[47:46.440 --> 47:47.240]  Here's Jose Guzman.
[47:47.920 --> 47:49.340]  Here's Nick Leyva.
[47:49.400 --> 47:49.820]  That's a manager
[47:49.820 --> 47:50.280]  card, we'll
[47:50.280 --> 47:50.560]  slave it.
[47:50.880 --> 47:51.700]  Randy Velarde.
[47:52.740 --> 47:53.360]  Uh, ooh, Brett
[47:53.820 --> 47:54.640]  Saberhagen with the
[47:54.640 --> 47:54.900]  All right.
[47:54.900 --> 47:55.780]  All-star card.
[47:55.800 --> 47:56.460]  That's a...
[47:56.460 --> 47:57.160]  That might be...
[47:57.160 --> 47:57.860]  That might be
[47:57.860 --> 47:58.200]  something.
[47:58.720 --> 47:59.520]  I don't know, like,
[47:59.580 --> 48:00.700]  many other classic
[48:00.700 --> 48:01.340]  royals than
[48:01.340 --> 48:01.940]  Saberhagen.
[48:01.940 --> 48:02.420]  I'll look...
[48:02.420 --> 48:02.900]  We'll look up
[48:02.900 --> 48:03.640]  Saberhagen for you.
[48:03.780 --> 48:04.220]  Saberhagen.
[48:04.360 --> 48:05.400]  Steve Bedrosian.
[48:05.500 --> 48:05.960]  tossing, but like,
[48:06.000 --> 48:06.240]  you know.
[48:06.480 --> 48:07.080]  Oh, here we go.
[48:07.080 --> 48:07.420]  All right, names of
[48:07.420 --> 48:08.240]  fish, Sid Bream.
[48:08.640 --> 48:08.680]  Oh.
[48:09.200 --> 48:10.320]  I think we have one of
[48:10.320 --> 48:10.720]  those already.
[48:10.920 --> 48:11.540]  Names of fish right
[48:11.540 --> 48:12.360]  there with Mike Trout.
[48:12.700 --> 48:12.940]  Yes.
[48:13.920 --> 48:14.600]  Dan Bilardello.
[48:15.540 --> 48:16.180]  Uh, oh, here's
[48:16.180 --> 48:17.020]  Bernie Williams.
[48:18.140 --> 48:18.740]  Great player.
[48:19.420 --> 48:20.100]  There's a...
[48:20.100 --> 48:20.860]  Cool hat.
[48:21.200 --> 48:21.420]  You might
[48:21.420 --> 48:22.400]  get that hat.
[48:22.540 --> 48:24.000]  Dude, I want...
[48:24.000 --> 48:24.560]  Is there a way we can
[48:24.560 --> 48:24.960]  get that hat?
[48:24.980 --> 48:25.840]  I want that top
[48:25.840 --> 48:26.580]  baseball hat.
[48:27.760 --> 48:28.640]  We need to figure
[48:28.640 --> 48:29.260]  out how to get that hat.
[48:29.380 --> 48:30.020]  If we can't get it
[48:30.460 --> 48:31.100]  from them, we'll
[48:31.100 --> 48:31.440]  buy it on eBay.
[48:31.780 --> 48:32.480]  Brian Fisher.
[48:33.320 --> 48:33.660]  The...
[48:34.340 --> 48:34.680]  It's...
[48:34.680 --> 48:34.900]  hat on the floor with
[48:34.900 --> 48:35.760]  a ball on it?
[48:36.120 --> 48:36.540]  Maybe.
[48:37.140 --> 48:37.700]  Either way, we're
[48:37.700 --> 48:38.020]  getting it.
[48:38.400 --> 48:38.740]  Oh.
[48:38.920 --> 48:39.960]  Steve Frey.
[48:40.120 --> 48:40.860]  It's my mission in
[48:40.860 --> 48:41.500]  life to get that and
[48:41.500 --> 48:42.160]  wear that hat on this
[48:42.160 --> 48:42.340]  show.
[48:42.720 --> 48:43.500]  Carlos Martinez,
[48:43.680 --> 48:44.320]  Rookie Cup.
[48:44.920 --> 48:47.240]  Uh, Sito Gaston.
[48:48.100 --> 48:48.980]  Don August.
[48:49.320 --> 48:50.040]  I wonder if we
[48:50.040 --> 48:50.640]  can do a year.
[48:50.840 --> 48:51.320]  I wonder if we can
[48:51.320 --> 48:51.780]  do a year.
[48:52.180 --> 48:53.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[48:53.060 --> 48:53.900]  A calendar year.
[48:54.240 --> 48:54.300]  Yeah.
[48:54.580 --> 48:55.440]  David Cohn.
[48:56.360 --> 48:57.560]  Uh, Greg Swindell.
[48:57.780 --> 48:58.480]  Oh, and the
[48:58.480 --> 49:00.220]  great manager Dave
[49:00.220 --> 49:00.700]  Johnson.
[49:01.200 --> 49:02.840]  That's a fucking...
[49:02.840 --> 49:03.420]  That's a look.
[49:03.520 --> 49:04.080]  I love that.
[49:04.220 --> 49:04.400]  Yeah.
[49:04.820 --> 49:05.620]  That's a neck.
[49:05.960 --> 49:06.160]  Yeah.
[49:06.700 --> 49:07.440]  Uh, we'll open up
[49:07.440 --> 49:07.880]  one more pack of
[49:07.880 --> 49:08.500]  Recon, because I
[49:09.020 --> 49:09.940]  really just hate that
[49:09.940 --> 49:10.520]  I haven't opened them
[49:10.520 --> 49:10.800]  all yet.
[49:10.980 --> 49:11.620]  Yeah, I understand.
[49:16.080 --> 49:17.040]  We open the stuff
[49:17.040 --> 49:17.720]  that you guys send
[49:17.720 --> 49:18.000]  too.
[49:18.140 --> 49:18.760]  So, if you want to
[49:18.760 --> 49:19.420]  send more, you can.
[49:19.600 --> 49:20.700]  1901 East 51st
[49:20.700 --> 49:21.420]  Street, Austin, Texas
[49:21.940 --> 49:22.300]  78723.
[49:22.420 --> 49:22.940]  Just make sure it
[49:22.940 --> 49:23.540]  says Break Show.
[49:24.100 --> 49:25.500]  Um, it'll get to us
[49:25.500 --> 49:26.140]  and then we'll try to
[49:26.140 --> 49:26.680]  open it on the show.
[49:27.420 --> 49:28.520]  Here's a Rookie
[49:28.520 --> 49:29.800]  Rookie, David Roddy
[49:29.800 --> 49:30.240]  insert.
[49:30.320 --> 49:30.780]  That's probably not
[49:30.780 --> 49:31.240]  worth anything.
[49:31.360 --> 49:31.860]  Rookie, Rookie,
[49:32.040 --> 49:32.200]  Roddy.
[49:32.380 --> 49:33.280]  Uh, ooh.
[49:34.460 --> 49:35.520]  John Morant, numbered
[49:36.040 --> 49:37.060]  177 to 190.
[49:37.060 --> 49:38.000]  Alright, yeah.
[49:38.780 --> 49:39.740]  That's my guy right
[49:39.740 --> 49:39.980]  there.
[49:40.620 --> 49:40.980]  Look at him
[49:40.980 --> 49:41.640]  shooting, man.
[49:41.740 --> 49:42.280]  He's pulling up.
[49:42.680 --> 49:43.080]  Triple...
[49:43.080 --> 49:43.760]  There's his
[49:43.760 --> 49:44.740]  teammate, Triple J,
[49:45.000 --> 49:46.780]  who, uh, really
[49:47.340 --> 49:47.740]  underperformed.
[49:47.780 --> 49:48.600]  Jared Jackson Jr., yeah.
[49:48.620 --> 49:49.620]  Really underperformed
[49:49.620 --> 49:50.520]  on that U.S. team.
[49:51.280 --> 49:52.080]  Anthony Davis.
[49:52.940 --> 49:53.660]  Uh, boy, they could
[49:53.660 --> 49:54.240]  have used the center
[49:54.240 --> 49:54.860]  on that team.
[49:54.920 --> 49:55.000]  Yep.
[49:55.320 --> 49:56.680]  Sorry, Triple J, you're
[49:56.680 --> 49:57.380]  a great player, but
[49:57.380 --> 49:58.340]  God damn, man.
[49:58.680 --> 49:59.100]  I mean, A.D.'s not
[49:59.100 --> 49:59.680]  gonna go do it.
[50:00.640 --> 50:01.320]  They desperately...
[50:01.320 --> 50:01.640]  I don't know who
[50:01.640 --> 50:02.160]  else they would get.
[50:02.280 --> 50:02.420]  Yeah.
[50:02.660 --> 50:04.240]  Uh, Joker, and then
[50:04.240 --> 50:05.800]  Dougie Buckets, Doug
[50:05.800 --> 50:05.820]  McDermott.
[50:05.820 --> 50:07.460]  He looks like his
[50:07.460 --> 50:08.160]  old leg position.
[50:08.200 --> 50:08.560]  He's going, wait.
[50:10.460 --> 50:11.240]  He's being a little
[50:11.240 --> 50:11.540]  man.
[50:11.840 --> 50:12.660]  I'm a little man.
[50:12.780 --> 50:12.940]  Yeah.
[50:13.280 --> 50:13.920]  Now we're gonna open
[50:13.920 --> 50:14.380]  up...
[50:14.380 --> 50:15.260]  I bought these in
[50:15.260 --> 50:16.400]  Michigan as well, I
[50:16.400 --> 50:16.700]  believe.
[50:16.820 --> 50:17.640]  These are 1990
[50:17.640 --> 50:18.700]  Tops Hockey.
[50:18.800 --> 50:19.440]  I hate when we get
[50:19.440 --> 50:20.100]  into the hockey cards.
[50:20.200 --> 50:20.560]  I know, you hate it.
[50:20.560 --> 50:21.840]  There's like nothing...
[50:21.840 --> 50:22.920]  The names are hard,
[50:22.920 --> 50:23.860]  and there's like nothing
[50:23.860 --> 50:24.320]  to add.
[50:24.600 --> 50:25.640]  And I have no idea
[50:25.640 --> 50:26.400]  what's worth anything.
[50:26.940 --> 50:27.820]  If anything.
[50:28.160 --> 50:28.580]  It's the worst.
[50:28.960 --> 50:29.600]  Oh, this is probably
[50:29.600 --> 50:30.060]  worth something.
[50:30.420 --> 50:31.260]  Wayne Gretzky.
[50:31.680 --> 50:31.720]  Oh, yay!
[50:32.460 --> 50:33.040]  Who is that?
[50:33.040 --> 50:33.860]  He's scoring leader.
[50:34.780 --> 50:36.020]  Dad's obsessed with
[50:36.020 --> 50:36.460]  Wayne Gretzky.
[50:36.720 --> 50:37.860]  Really good shape,
[50:37.960 --> 50:38.080]  too.
[50:38.120 --> 50:38.540]  That might...
[50:38.540 --> 50:38.980]  Thank you.
[50:39.540 --> 50:40.300]  Joe Sakic.
[50:40.560 --> 50:41.300]  I know that one.
[50:41.740 --> 50:42.360]  He's a star.
[50:43.620 --> 50:44.580]  Mike Maylor.
[50:44.960 --> 50:45.740]  Ron Sutter.
[50:45.940 --> 50:47.200]  Hey, if anybody in the
[50:47.200 --> 50:47.860]  chat wants to let me
[50:47.860 --> 50:48.580]  know if I...
[50:48.580 --> 50:49.620]  Yeah, JJJ sucked
[50:49.620 --> 50:50.240]  for Team USA.
[50:50.520 --> 50:51.320]  That's unfortunate.
[50:54.940 --> 50:55.980]  Matteo Snyder.
[50:57.000 --> 50:58.040]  Stéphane Lebeau.
[50:59.840 --> 51:00.880]  Paul McClain.
[51:02.400 --> 51:03.440]  Doug Gilmore.
[51:04.700 --> 51:05.700]  Charlie Huddy.
[51:05.900 --> 51:06.200]  Wow.
[51:06.500 --> 51:07.220]  That's a...
[51:07.220 --> 51:08.780]  That might be a stepdad.
[51:09.120 --> 51:09.240]  Yeah.
[51:09.820 --> 51:10.460]  This is where I would
[51:10.460 --> 51:11.660]  need my dad to...
[51:11.660 --> 51:12.540]  The way you talk about
[51:12.540 --> 51:13.300]  wrestling, he'd talk
[51:13.300 --> 51:13.860]  about those people.
[51:14.040 --> 51:15.360]  This is...
[51:15.360 --> 51:16.520]  This is...
[51:17.540 --> 51:18.780]  A fucking awesome name.
[51:19.040 --> 51:19.400]  I don't know what
[51:19.400 --> 51:19.820]  we're going to do with
[51:19.820 --> 51:20.800]  it, but Rick Zombo.
[51:24.740 --> 51:25.540]  That's pretty good.
[51:25.740 --> 51:26.180]  I don't know.
[51:26.240 --> 51:26.940]  Let's save that,
[51:26.980 --> 51:27.560]  because I don't know.
[51:28.700 --> 51:29.600]  It's too good.
[51:30.020 --> 51:30.600]  Rick's a steady
[51:30.600 --> 51:31.560]  defender who generally
[51:31.560 --> 51:32.600]  plays it safe, letting
[51:32.600 --> 51:33.260]  others handle the
[51:33.260 --> 51:33.840]  offensive work.
[51:33.860 --> 51:34.760]  That sucks.
[51:34.860 --> 51:35.680]  That's the worst thing.
[51:35.740 --> 51:36.360]  That's like saying,
[51:36.460 --> 51:37.040]  how was your date?
[51:37.120 --> 51:37.860]  Oh, he was nice.
[51:38.180 --> 51:38.400]  Yeah.
[51:39.460 --> 51:40.160]  It's fine.
[51:41.700 --> 51:42.140]  Curtis...
[51:42.760 --> 51:42.980]  Curtis.
[51:43.620 --> 51:44.060]  Curtis.
[51:44.860 --> 51:45.300]  There's...
[51:45.820 --> 51:47.220]  Sylvan Lefevre.
[51:48.640 --> 51:49.520]  Keith Acton.
[51:50.240 --> 51:50.600]  Wow.
[51:50.960 --> 51:51.320]  Oh.
[51:51.340 --> 51:51.940]  That guy looks like
[51:51.940 --> 51:53.080]  Peyton Manning or something.
[51:54.120 --> 51:55.000]  Or like Anthony Edwards.
[51:55.140 --> 51:55.660]  Not Anthony Edwards.
[51:55.740 --> 51:56.320]  Yeah, the guy from
[51:56.320 --> 51:56.600]  E.R.
[51:57.240 --> 51:57.940]  Oh, yeah.
[51:58.060 --> 51:58.780]  Anthony Edwards.
[51:59.040 --> 51:59.680]  It does kind of look
[51:59.680 --> 52:00.100]  like Anthony Edwards.
[52:00.340 --> 52:00.880]  Maybe it's separated
[52:00.880 --> 52:01.780]  at birth, Anthony Edwards.
[52:03.260 --> 52:04.280]  Los Angeles Kings.
[52:04.780 --> 52:05.140]  Hey.
[52:05.560 --> 52:06.600]  And then...
[52:07.820 --> 52:08.540]  Rob Brindamore.
[52:09.500 --> 52:09.840]  That...

[52:18.500 --> 52:19.120]  these are called.
[52:19.180 --> 52:20.160]  But we've got some
[52:20.160 --> 52:20.860]  other stuff we can open.
[52:21.060 --> 52:23.000]  We're almost at Lorna Doon.

[52:33.200 --> 52:33.580]  but Disney.

[53:48.360 --> 53:48.600]  Okay.
[53:49.300 --> 53:49.960]  Nothing there.
[53:50.480 --> 53:51.200]  Seven minutes.
[53:51.400 --> 53:52.420]  Well, we got time to open up.
[53:52.580 --> 53:53.080]  We'll take a little bit.
[53:53.200 --> 53:54.020]  One more and then we'll get into...
[53:54.020 --> 53:55.320]  Yeah, and then we'll get into...
[53:55.320 --> 53:56.980]  And then we'll get into Laura Conner.
[53:57.040 --> 53:59.820]  Can't wait to see these fucking cards that Fisher's gonna come out and be like,
[53:59.860 --> 54:01.200]  I'll get those, I mean, if you don't want them.

[54:12.140 --> 54:13.040]  He's good.
[54:13.340 --> 54:14.400]  And Christian Pache.
[54:14.760 --> 54:14.980]  Okay.
[54:15.120 --> 54:15.500]  Okay.
[54:15.820 --> 54:16.440]  All right.
[54:16.440 --> 54:17.560]  Now, let's open up.
[54:17.780 --> 54:19.000]  Let's try this.
[54:19.200 --> 54:20.240]  So, what did you get?
[54:20.280 --> 54:20.960]  Because there's two things.
[54:21.020 --> 54:24.680]  So, I got the first chapter, a starting deck, which is supposed to have like...
[54:24.680 --> 54:26.460]  I don't know because I don't play this shit, right?
[54:26.480 --> 54:27.400]  And I've never played Magic.
[54:27.720 --> 54:27.900]  Cool.
[54:28.140 --> 54:29.180]  But they'll have like...
[54:29.180 --> 54:31.700]  I guess they'll be like an amount of cards that are the same.
[54:31.840 --> 54:33.300]  Like everybody gets the same base pack.
[54:33.460 --> 54:35.000]  And then they'll probably be some...
[54:35.000 --> 54:39.580]  Yeah, like here's your base cards and then here's the...
[54:39.580 --> 54:41.220]  Let's go through some of the base cards.
[54:41.220 --> 54:42.160]  I don't even see all of them.
[54:42.300 --> 54:43.400]  Yeah, I don't either.
[54:43.620 --> 54:44.380]  Because if they're base cards...
[54:44.380 --> 54:46.260]  Yeah, I don't want people to know what's in my deck.
[54:46.500 --> 54:49.220]  I keep it like it's kind of a surprise for my tournament play.
[54:49.680 --> 54:50.040]  So...
[54:50.040 --> 54:51.180]  But, you know, we'll see.
[54:51.380 --> 54:53.980]  Is the Wayward Sorcerer, that's what this one is.
[54:54.020 --> 54:55.300]  Is that what your chase card is?
[54:55.320 --> 54:57.160]  Or like what character would you look for in the Disney universe?
[54:57.160 --> 54:58.800]  I'm looking for like...
[54:58.800 --> 55:00.720]  If they got like...
[55:01.380 --> 55:04.300]  Donald Duck is like some kind of like rogue.
[55:04.540 --> 55:04.780]  Yeah.
[55:04.960 --> 55:05.380]  You know?
[55:05.500 --> 55:06.280]  Well, I got Ariel.
[55:06.820 --> 55:07.100]  All right.
[55:07.160 --> 55:09.340]  Well, I want Eric because he's the hottest prince out there.
[55:09.380 --> 55:10.040]  I got Ariel.
[55:10.040 --> 55:10.140]  I got Ariel.
[55:10.340 --> 55:10.820]  Oh, here's...
[55:10.820 --> 55:11.300]  I never...
[55:11.300 --> 55:13.720]  Same name, never felt anything for that guy.
[55:13.940 --> 55:14.680]  Here's our foil.
[55:15.060 --> 55:16.200]  Here's our Moana foil.
[55:16.900 --> 55:18.400]  Moana auto on card?
[55:18.520 --> 55:18.760]  Holy shit.
[55:18.760 --> 55:19.920]  We should probably sleeve that.
[55:20.000 --> 55:20.900]  And then Mickey foil.
[55:21.120 --> 55:21.560]  Whoa!
[55:21.920 --> 55:22.860]  That's the sorcerer.
[55:22.860 --> 55:23.940]  Let's not bother foiling those.
[55:23.960 --> 55:26.140]  I'm going to guess we got those foils because they're on the cover.
[55:26.320 --> 55:27.020]  No way!
[55:27.580 --> 55:28.020]  Yeah.
[55:28.180 --> 55:28.620]  Oh, look.
[55:28.640 --> 55:30.040]  There's the wardrobe from...
[55:30.880 --> 55:31.980]  There's the wardrobe.

[55:41.080 --> 55:42.540]  So, here's our booster.
[55:42.960 --> 55:43.280]  Okay.
[55:43.740 --> 55:44.220]  Pack.
[55:44.400 --> 55:44.720]  Okay.
[55:45.140 --> 55:46.020]  Let's see what we get.
[55:46.380 --> 55:46.740]  All right.

[55:57.380 --> 55:57.860]  He's...
[55:57.860 --> 55:58.540]  Wait, what's the...
[55:58.540 --> 55:59.300]  I don't care about this one.
[55:59.320 --> 55:59.880]  Go to the next one.
[56:00.140 --> 56:01.200]  What the fuck?
[56:01.400 --> 56:03.480]  Kind of Saints Row-ass fly suit.

[56:32.600 --> 56:33.300]  Yeah, I think so.
[56:33.360 --> 56:35.220]  He's gonna beat that dog to death with that.

[56:39.960 --> 56:40.940]  Here's Goofy again.
[56:41.200 --> 56:42.020]  It's Goofy Musketeer.
[56:42.980 --> 56:43.320]  This is like Kingdom Hearts.
[56:43.320 --> 56:45.080]  Remember that game that we were playing?
[56:45.700 --> 56:47.820]  The Disney video game we were playing?
[56:48.180 --> 56:50.420]  And every time you were near Goofy, he was like, gawrsh.
[56:50.540 --> 56:51.300]  Oh, Dreamlight Valley?
[56:51.400 --> 56:51.660]  Yeah.
[56:52.340 --> 56:53.140]  Cruella de Vil.
[56:53.400 --> 56:55.980]  When you said you had these cards, I thought they were Dreamlight Valley cards.
[56:56.360 --> 56:57.420]  When you're like, these are Lorikana.
[56:57.580 --> 56:58.280]  I'm like, oh, this is like an Xbox game.
[56:58.280 --> 56:59.260]  No, it's like some other thing.
[56:59.280 --> 56:59.980]  Yeah, it's like a different thing.
[57:00.140 --> 57:00.640]  Mickey Mouse.
[57:00.680 --> 57:03.600]  I only know about it because people kept emailing me about it.
[57:03.620 --> 57:04.620]  He's like a...
[57:04.620 --> 57:05.380]  He's a brave little tailor.

[57:07.800 --> 57:08.620]  He's got fucking scissors.
[57:09.040 --> 57:10.360]  And then here's our foil card.
[57:10.500 --> 57:11.940]  It's Ariel on human legs.
[57:12.700 --> 57:13.020]  Oh.
[57:13.280 --> 57:14.000]  That's when she can't talk.
[57:14.020 --> 57:16.520]  I guess we'll sleeve that for some reason.
[57:17.340 --> 57:18.600]  He has my favorite kind of Ariel.
[57:18.880 --> 57:19.500]  She can't talk.
[57:20.620 --> 57:22.000]  She can't talk when she has human legs?
[57:22.100 --> 57:22.420]  Nuh-uh.
[57:22.740 --> 57:23.520]  That's like the whole thing.
[57:23.560 --> 57:25.700]  Ursula takes her voice, and then she can go up there,
[57:25.740 --> 57:27.620]  and then she doesn't know what a fork is or something.
[57:27.960 --> 57:30.900]  Well, it's a thingamajig, and it's to brush her hair.
[57:31.700 --> 57:34.480]  But yeah, Ursula has a whole song about how you don't need to talk.
[57:34.480 --> 57:35.500]  Guys don't like that.
[57:36.780 --> 57:37.940]  Like, just use your body.
[57:38.080 --> 57:38.840]  That's all they care about.
[57:40.080 --> 57:40.800]  There's Maleficent.
[57:41.080 --> 57:41.740]  Oh, magnificent.
[57:42.780 --> 57:43.980]  Here we have Peter Pan.
[57:44.320 --> 57:44.460]  Peter Pan.

[57:51.820 --> 57:52.760]  Uh, Minnie Mouse.
[57:52.840 --> 57:53.340]  Minnie Mouse.

[57:55.420 --> 57:55.940]  I love the name of it.
[57:55.940 --> 57:56.640]  Good Mickey.
[57:57.260 --> 57:58.480]  You know, sleeve the Dinglehopper.
[57:58.560 --> 57:58.760]  Yeah.
[57:59.000 --> 57:59.880]  There's the Beast's mirror.
[58:00.680 --> 58:01.180]  That's cool.
[58:01.220 --> 58:02.720]  That's where he looks to see if he's still the Beast.
[58:03.020 --> 58:03.920]  It's a smash.
[58:03.920 --> 58:04.900]  That's what goons do.
[58:05.040 --> 58:05.360]  They smash.
[58:05.780 --> 58:06.660]  Shield of Virtue.
[58:07.320 --> 58:08.180]  That's pretty good, right?
[58:08.920 --> 58:09.280]  Befuddle.
[58:09.600 --> 58:10.560]  That's what I am, usually.
[58:11.420 --> 58:12.440]  It's Geoff and a card.
[58:12.640 --> 58:12.840]  Yeah.
[58:13.120 --> 58:13.480]  Hades.
[58:13.860 --> 58:14.160]  Uh-huh.
[58:15.180 --> 58:15.540]  Kuzgo.
[58:15.680 --> 58:19.380]  So you were telling me before the show that you were looking for the Hades card, but just
[58:19.380 --> 58:22.720]  because you, like, just, like, agree with, like, his opinions online or something?
[58:22.860 --> 58:23.600]  Is that what you were saying?
[58:23.620 --> 58:24.440]  That's not what I was saying.
[58:24.880 --> 58:27.280]  Uh, we got another Ariel black foil.
[58:27.360 --> 58:29.180]  So if anyone wants to trade, uh...
[58:29.760 --> 58:32.220]  Guys, does anyone out there want to trade?
[58:32.580 --> 58:33.460]  We got an extra Ariel.
[58:33.460 --> 58:37.300]  This character can't whatever to sing songs.
[58:37.380 --> 58:38.540]  There's a...
[58:38.540 --> 58:38.920]  They can't whatever.
[58:38.940 --> 58:39.660]  Maybe we should learn how to sing.
[58:40.780 --> 58:41.400]  I forgot.
[58:41.540 --> 58:44.740]  The dinglehopper removes up to one damage from chosen character.
[58:45.100 --> 58:46.240]  Enjoy the finest of human hair.
[58:46.240 --> 58:47.140]  Enjoy these cards, Fisher.
[58:47.360 --> 58:48.020]  I forgot.
[58:48.260 --> 58:48.840]  We didn't...
[58:49.420 --> 58:50.160]  We don't have any time!
[58:50.200 --> 58:50.960]  Decision 92.
[58:51.080 --> 58:53.000]  We're gonna open up one fucking Decision 92 card.
[58:53.040 --> 58:53.960]  We might be able to get through two.
[58:54.460 --> 58:55.040]  Two packs.
[58:55.100 --> 58:55.880]  What do you want the most?
[58:55.960 --> 58:56.900]  Pro-life or pro-choice?
[58:57.060 --> 58:59.400]  Oh, I want Ross Perot auto on card.
[59:00.300 --> 59:02.040]  I'm Ross Perot choice, so...
[59:04.160 --> 59:05.380]  Can it finish? Can it finish?
[59:07.640 --> 59:08.420]  Deep cut!
[59:08.780 --> 59:09.440]  Oh, boy.
[59:10.380 --> 59:11.060]  Very sticky.
[59:11.360 --> 59:12.140]  92 jokes.
[59:13.740 --> 59:14.560]  Each pack is...
[59:14.560 --> 59:14.980]  Oh, my God.
[59:15.140 --> 59:16.920]  Each pack might just be one card now.
[59:17.400 --> 59:18.380]  Okay, let's see what we got here.
[59:18.640 --> 59:18.960]  We got...
[59:18.960 --> 59:20.860]  Oh, the JFA conspiracies.
[59:21.400 --> 59:21.840]  That's...
[59:23.120 --> 59:24.540]  Is that Oliver Stone?
[59:24.600 --> 59:25.200]  That's Oliver Stone.
[59:25.640 --> 59:26.280]  That's awesome!
[59:26.620 --> 59:28.700]  Oh, here we have the election of 1860.
[59:28.920 --> 59:29.140]  Cool.
[59:29.340 --> 59:29.800]  Remember that one.
[59:29.900 --> 59:30.800]  That was a big one.
[59:30.820 --> 59:31.520]  That was a close one.
[59:31.520 --> 59:31.960]  Yeah.
[59:33.040 --> 59:33.900]  Down to the wire.
[59:34.060 --> 59:35.000]  Oh, these are hard to open.
[59:35.120 --> 59:35.500]  Hanging chads and everything.
[59:36.080 --> 59:37.140]  Oh, Bush on issues.
[59:37.800 --> 59:38.760]  Not gonna do it.
[59:39.320 --> 59:40.440]  Not gonna do it.
[59:40.480 --> 59:40.980]  Not gonna do it.
[59:41.420 --> 59:42.980]  And then we have...
[59:43.760 --> 59:44.780]  Perot saddles up.
[59:45.840 --> 59:48.900]  That was back when Ross Perot was in the Civil War.
[59:51.120 --> 59:51.520]  Billions.
[59:51.640 --> 59:53.740]  Eric Clinton on the issues, talking about issues.
[59:55.340 --> 59:55.740]  Then...
[59:55.740 --> 59:57.840]  Oh, we have Perot's VP selection.
[59:58.000 --> 59:59.300]  That's right, it was Storm and Norman.
[59:59.540 --> 01:00:00.940]  Yeah, it was like...
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:02.580]  Weird time for...
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:03.600]  Weird time.
[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:04.360]  Weird time.
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:04.840]  But we gotta keep going.
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:06.440]  R&C, R&C, there you go.
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.200]  That looks like Dallas.
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:07.720]  That's Austin.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:08.660]  Is that Austin?
[01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:09.520]  No, that's Houston.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.120]  That's Houston.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.300]  Sorry, I saw the little...
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:12.080]  They're all the same to me.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:13.700]  Republican VP selection.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:14.480]  George Bush.
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:17.160]  Oh my God, let's have a sweaty pits selection.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.380]  Oh, here we have Law and Order.
[01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:23.320]  Is that Rodney Keene?
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.060]  That's Rodney Keene.
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.020]  Alright, well, last pack.
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:28.240]  Last pack mojo.
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.020]  Last pack mojo.
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.520]  This is an interesting...
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.560]  group of cards.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.100]  This card's all beat up.
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:37.340]  Kinda like the institution.
[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:38.120]  There's the White House.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.660]  Oh, here we have fuckin' sexual harassment.
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:43.880]  Hey, can we sleeve that?
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.040]  That's a good-ass card.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:47.400]  Dipshit.
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:48.560]  There we got the Democrat.
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.280]  There's another one.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:50.980]  Gay rights.
[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:51.620]  Hey.
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:52.560]  Oh, that's awesome.
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:53.540]  These cards are...
[01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:55.320]  These cards are bizarre.
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:56.200]  Yeah, they are bizarre.
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.640]  Oh, here we have...
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:58.380]  Clinton blows.
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:02.320]  Here we have former Soviet Union.
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:03.020]  Is that...
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:03.540]  There we go.
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:04.380]  That's old...
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.100]  What's-his-face.
[01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:08.820]  And then...
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:09.620]  Oh, there's a checklist.
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:12.560]  Here's Nixon and Watergate.
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:15.280]  All the highlights of all of our worst moments as a country.
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:16.420]  Perot on the issues.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.780]  It's the issue of do I take my wife out to dinner or not.
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:21.960]  And then Democratic VP selection.
[01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:22.420]  Wow.
[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:23.640]  Here you go.
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:24.600]  Wow!
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:26.900]  We ended on a high note with that one.
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:29.300]  Thanks for spending the last hour with us.
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:32.620]  If you enjoyed it, maybe come and tune in next week.

[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:36.620]  That's where the chat is.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:37.740]  So you can go chat with people and say,
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.760]  Hey, whoa, crazy card.
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:41.420]  Good stuff.

[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:47.180]  Maybe we'll play the Common Thread game.
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:48.100]  Whatever that is.
[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:48.500]  We will.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:50.540]  There will be more Monopoly cards or something.
[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:51.940]  No more Lorna Doom.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:52.640]  Those are gone.
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:54.080]  And Summer 98.
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:55.960]  Thank you very much!
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:56.960]  Thanks for watching.

[01:01:58.700 --> 01:01:59.300]  See you next week!
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:01:59.660]  Okay.
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.160]  The back of this card is one-sided red.
