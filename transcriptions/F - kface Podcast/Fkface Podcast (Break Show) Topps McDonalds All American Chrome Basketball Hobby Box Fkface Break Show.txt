[00:08.660 --> 00:12.540]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the...
[00:13.400 --> 00:13.880]  Mother...
[00:13.880 --> 00:15.780]  I think the batteries died last time.
[00:16.080 --> 00:17.040]  Space Break Show.
[00:18.460 --> 00:20.980]  Son of a bitch, I checked the batteries before we started.
[00:21.140 --> 00:22.820]  I ran it five times and it worked fine.
[00:22.900 --> 00:24.500]  Don't curse in the first five minutes, we'll get demoted.
[00:24.560 --> 00:27.260]  Embarrassing me, you stupid f***ing thing.
[00:27.540 --> 00:27.940]  It worked.
[00:28.980 --> 00:30.780]  Hey, we're so happy you're here.
[00:31.680 --> 00:33.360]  I'm here, Emily's here.
[00:33.460 --> 00:33.600]  Hi.
[00:33.840 --> 00:34.460]  Eric's here.
[00:34.540 --> 00:34.680]  Hello.
[00:34.680 --> 00:34.740]  Hello.
[00:37.240 --> 00:38.540]  Got Zim Bearer's here.
[00:38.660 --> 00:40.080]  Looks like Shaq is here somewhere.
[00:40.500 --> 00:41.020]  Chipette's here.
[00:41.100 --> 00:42.080]  We got the Chipette's here.
[00:43.320 --> 00:45.320]  And let's have some fun, shall we?
[00:45.560 --> 00:45.820]  Yeah.
[00:45.940 --> 00:47.080]  How's your Monday going so far, Eric?
[00:47.220 --> 00:48.320]  So far, so good.
[00:48.500 --> 00:49.820]  He has been a little off today.
[00:50.260 --> 00:50.500]  Yeah.
[00:50.580 --> 00:51.020]  All day.
[00:51.080 --> 00:51.380]  Yeah.
[00:51.540 --> 00:53.900]  We did a recording earlier today on Anima and I just...
[00:53.900 --> 00:54.360]  He felt the...
[00:54.360 --> 00:55.460]  I don't know, I feel like I...
[00:55.460 --> 00:57.280]  Like maybe I did something wrong or I said something wrong.
[00:57.360 --> 00:57.740]  He's been...
[00:57.740 --> 00:58.320]  And then you...
[00:58.320 --> 01:00.480]  You have your business jacket on today and you've been...
[01:00.480 --> 01:02.400]  You've had a business attitude all day.
[01:02.460 --> 01:02.640]  Yeah.
[01:02.640 --> 01:06.400]  Today is the day that I do all five jobs of mine in one day.
[01:06.800 --> 01:07.860]  Bit of a landmine.
[01:08.080 --> 01:08.380]  It's weird.
[01:08.600 --> 01:08.920]  It's...
[01:08.920 --> 01:11.240]  Geoff is like, oh, everyone else is like the problem.
[01:11.400 --> 01:12.700]  And that's so strange.
[01:12.820 --> 01:12.980]  Yeah.
[01:13.160 --> 01:15.800]  If everybody else is the problem, stop being the problem.
[01:16.000 --> 01:16.800]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:16.840 --> 01:17.440]  You hear what they say?
[01:17.500 --> 01:20.640]  If everyone else is the problem, then you're always the victim, which is your favorite
[01:20.640 --> 01:20.700]  role.
[01:20.720 --> 01:24.500]  If everyone else is the problem, it clearly can't be you because you notice the problem.
[01:24.520 --> 01:25.280]  Yeah, you're the victim.
[01:25.860 --> 01:26.000]  Yep.
[01:26.320 --> 01:26.640]  Absolutely.
[01:27.000 --> 01:30.220]  Geoff, today is a great day to open some cards.
[01:30.540 --> 01:32.380]  But what are we going for?
[01:32.380 --> 01:34.500]  What's like the main event of today's show?
[01:34.540 --> 01:35.420]  Oh, my God, Eric.
[01:35.480 --> 01:37.300]  I'm so glad you asked.
[01:37.400 --> 01:39.380]  I've been wanting to open this for a while.
[01:39.460 --> 01:42.440]  As you know, I'm a fame and a clout chaser.
[01:43.180 --> 01:44.080]  No, I just...
[01:44.080 --> 01:45.860]  He's in a bad mood, drooling everywhere.
[01:46.220 --> 01:46.780]  God damn it.
[01:46.860 --> 01:48.000]  He's doing the show dog style.
[01:48.260 --> 01:48.500]  He's like...
[01:48.500 --> 01:49.060]  I'm kidding.
[01:49.360 --> 01:51.240]  I gaslight you guys, not the other way around.
[01:51.740 --> 01:53.180]  See how quickly it changes.
[01:53.180 --> 01:53.900]  It's really...
[01:53.900 --> 01:56.240]  That's why he gets so pissed with the fuck face guys.
[01:56.320 --> 01:57.360]  He's like...
[01:57.360 --> 01:57.780]  No!
[01:58.660 --> 01:59.160]  Did I drool?
[01:59.360 --> 02:00.700]  You're drooling on the sack pack.
[02:00.700 --> 02:02.140]  And it got all over me too.
[02:02.420 --> 02:05.360]  Almost as much as the pee got on you with the vet today.
[02:05.620 --> 02:07.500]  It did and I still am in my pee pants.
[02:07.540 --> 02:08.440]  You got pee pants dog.
[02:08.440 --> 02:08.840]  I do.
[02:08.980 --> 02:11.720]  He got real excited and a little...
[02:11.720 --> 02:14.820]  A little LeBron James Jr. just pissing everywhere.
[02:15.020 --> 02:16.000]  Baby Bronny, yeah.
[02:16.560 --> 02:17.740]  Dog peed all over...
[02:17.740 --> 02:18.780]  He did not pee all over me.
[02:18.840 --> 02:19.800]  He just had a little piddle.
[02:20.440 --> 02:23.140]  Because he was only calm with the vet in my arms.
[02:23.520 --> 02:25.720]  I was like, what are the chances you're changing pants?
[02:25.720 --> 02:28.780]  And since I have not stopped moving, here I am in my pee pants.
[02:28.780 --> 02:31.740]  But this is what we're gunning for today, right?
[02:31.740 --> 02:32.660]  Yeah, this is the big one.
[02:33.120 --> 02:34.020]  This top's chrome.
[02:35.060 --> 02:36.740]  McDonald's, All-American Games.
[02:37.300 --> 02:38.140]  But this is a hobby box.
[02:38.240 --> 02:38.940]  You can buy these at Walmart.
[02:39.140 --> 02:39.580]  They're pretty cheap.
[02:39.700 --> 02:40.400]  They look like...
[02:41.100 --> 02:42.140]  You can get a...
[02:42.140 --> 02:42.900]  What is happening?
[02:43.020 --> 02:43.620]  I'm trying to find one.
[02:43.800 --> 02:43.960]  Oh.
[02:44.040 --> 02:44.900]  For example, Blaster.
[02:45.040 --> 02:45.700]  Looks like this.
[02:46.020 --> 02:46.820]  You see them all over the place.
[02:47.280 --> 02:48.820]  Typically these cards aren't worth much.
[02:48.960 --> 02:49.120]  Okay.
[02:49.760 --> 02:50.080]  Typically.
[02:50.200 --> 02:51.280]  This is only the second year they've done it.
[02:51.340 --> 02:52.160]  But they're not worth much.
[02:52.340 --> 02:54.020]  But this year, Bronny James is in it.
[02:54.160 --> 02:55.100]  He's selling autos in it.
[02:55.180 --> 02:56.900]  Those autos are going for a lot of fucking money.
[02:57.160 --> 02:58.100]  Like over a thousand dollars.
[02:58.100 --> 03:00.320]  And so I thought it'd be fun to try to...
[03:00.320 --> 03:00.580]  Go for...
[03:00.580 --> 03:01.700]  Like I said, clout and fame chase.
[03:01.780 --> 03:01.920]  Yeah.
[03:02.240 --> 03:02.900]  That's us.
[03:03.380 --> 03:03.780]  Classic.
[03:04.240 --> 03:05.000]  Classic us.
[03:05.260 --> 03:05.720]  I love...
[03:05.720 --> 03:06.840]  Fucking love clout.
[03:07.080 --> 03:07.480]  We'll...
[03:07.480 --> 03:08.140]  I love it.
[03:08.280 --> 03:09.700]  We'll chase that auto at the end of the season.
[03:09.780 --> 03:15.580]  Would we sell it as maybe our first sale if we got the auto?
[03:15.840 --> 03:16.260]  Oh, maybe.
[03:16.420 --> 03:18.900]  Because this is the time, I feel like, to cash in on that, you know?
[03:18.960 --> 03:19.200]  Yeah.
[03:19.300 --> 03:19.860]  Yeah, for sure.
[03:20.220 --> 03:20.560]  Based...
[03:20.560 --> 03:20.900]  I'm sorry.
[03:21.100 --> 03:21.880]  Based on what?
[03:22.180 --> 03:27.500]  Based on, like, how you had, like, a lot of Zion cards when they first came out.
[03:28.180 --> 03:30.460]  And you were really chasing them.
[03:30.940 --> 03:32.640]  You've seen the ups and the downs.
[03:32.720 --> 03:33.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:33.540 --> 03:34.400]  Like that...
[03:34.400 --> 03:38.620]  He could maybe have another little heart situation where he doesn't play at all.
[03:38.800 --> 03:40.440]  Speaking of Zion, playing the Celtics tonight.
[03:40.520 --> 03:40.780]  Yeah.
[03:41.020 --> 03:41.860]  Yep, yep, yep.
[03:41.920 --> 03:42.580]  We fucking...
[03:42.580 --> 03:45.440]  We sucked buttholes against the Clippers this weekend.
[03:46.300 --> 03:47.120]  Everybody's all up in arms.
[03:47.260 --> 03:48.060]  They're getting that new stadium.
[03:48.180 --> 03:49.280]  Are you gonna go sit in the Clippers section?
[03:49.980 --> 03:50.580]  Yeah, dude.
[03:50.600 --> 03:51.120]  I definitely will.
[03:51.160 --> 03:52.680]  Did you see the clip of that?
[03:52.720 --> 03:53.580]  People talking about it?
[03:53.640 --> 03:55.920]  And it's Snoop Dogg, and he's like, it's gonna be pretty empty.
[03:57.020 --> 03:58.200]  That was pretty funny.
[03:58.200 --> 04:00.960]  So are they not gonna change over the stadium anymore?
[04:01.160 --> 04:02.140]  Oh, they're...
[04:02.140 --> 04:03.220]  The Clippers are building a new stadium.
[04:03.360 --> 04:05.000]  Yeah, they're building a stadium out in Inglewood.
[04:05.100 --> 04:08.600]  They've been working on it for a while, and it's gonna be their own stadium, so they don't have to share.
[04:08.740 --> 04:10.040]  Oh, yeah, I was gonna say, that sounds like...
[04:10.860 --> 04:14.760]  But, you know, the rub is that nobody gives a shit about the Clippers in LA.
[04:15.500 --> 04:16.700]  Except for Billy Crystal, I think.
[04:17.360 --> 04:18.960]  I thought he was, like, the big Mets fan.
[04:19.500 --> 04:20.000]  That's baseball.
[04:22.920 --> 04:24.620]  Okay, so what else we got today, Geoff?
[04:25.340 --> 04:29.500]  Well, you know, the last couple times we've done this show, I have sadly...
[04:29.500 --> 04:31.280]  I'm covered in soda from my spilling.
[04:31.300 --> 04:32.340]  That's weird how that happened.
[04:32.500 --> 04:33.980]  It's crazy how I did that to you.
[04:34.180 --> 04:36.680]  It's crazy how I did that to you.
[04:36.780 --> 04:37.340]  Nobody said that.
[04:37.400 --> 04:38.240]  Now you're gaslighting me.
[04:39.940 --> 04:41.320]  Okay, we always...
[04:41.320 --> 04:42.120]  We'll come in at the beginning.
[04:42.320 --> 04:45.240]  We'll open up the pack sack, and then we'll also show the cards from last week that were the hits,
[04:45.320 --> 04:47.260]  and then I'll value them and show you how much they're worth, okay?
[04:47.640 --> 04:49.700]  I forgot to do that the last couple weeks, but I did it today.
[04:50.100 --> 04:54.040]  So I pulled some of the cards I found from the last couple episodes that we haven't graded yet.
[04:54.040 --> 04:56.440]  This 89 Sterling Sharp rookie.
[04:57.240 --> 04:58.860]  Hall of Famer, Sterling Sharp.
[04:59.640 --> 05:04.380]  When we're dealing with these old junkwax cards, we only speak in values of PSA 10,
[05:04.820 --> 05:07.040]  because those are the most exciting and also the least attainable.
[05:07.300 --> 05:08.780]  This would run you 75 bucks.
[05:08.940 --> 05:09.300]  Wow!
[05:09.900 --> 05:10.540]  Dang, really?
[05:10.720 --> 05:12.500]  Yeah, anything under that would run you...
[05:12.500 --> 05:13.200]  About two bucks?
[05:13.460 --> 05:14.160]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:15.080 --> 05:16.900]  While we were there, just because he was such a...
[05:17.880 --> 05:19.100]  Fucking force to be reckoned with.
[05:19.120 --> 05:19.680]  Joe Montana.
[05:19.880 --> 05:20.760]  How much do you think it is?
[05:20.860 --> 05:22.120]  I like this game. This is where I have fun.
[05:22.120 --> 05:22.580]  Okay, sorry.
[05:22.580 --> 05:23.780]  65 bucks.
[05:24.040 --> 05:24.160]  Under.
[05:24.680 --> 05:24.900]  Under?
[05:25.300 --> 05:26.100]  PSA 10?
[05:26.380 --> 05:27.420]  Run about 60 bucks.
[05:28.220 --> 05:29.060]  So you nailed that one.
[05:29.480 --> 05:32.380]  All right, this Bo Jackson Chicago White Sox.
[05:32.940 --> 05:34.900]  And you're going by PSA 10 grade?
[05:34.980 --> 05:35.580]  White Sox fan.
[05:35.960 --> 05:39.240]  Yeah, the PSA 10 of the 1991 Bo Jackson Upper Deck.
[05:39.240 --> 05:39.720]  90 bucks.
[05:40.040 --> 05:40.500]  90 bucks?
[05:40.620 --> 05:41.040]  Under.
[05:41.340 --> 05:41.660]  $30.
[05:42.200 --> 05:43.100]  Wow, really?
[05:43.140 --> 05:45.940]  This Ken Griffey Jr. Oversized Bowman rookie.
[05:46.840 --> 05:48.440]  What do you think a PSA 10 on that sucker's gonna run you?
[05:48.480 --> 05:49.440]  It's a rookie?
[05:49.660 --> 05:49.880]  Yeah.
[05:52.040 --> 05:52.520]  75.
[05:53.200 --> 05:53.680]  Over.
[05:54.540 --> 05:56.480]  PSA 10 will run you about $225.
[05:56.620 --> 05:57.100]  Wow!
[05:57.640 --> 05:59.140]  On that shitty looking card too?
[05:59.300 --> 05:59.420]  Yeah.
[05:59.420 --> 06:00.360]  That's not his signature.
[06:00.620 --> 06:02.180]  This Ronald McDonald...
[06:02.180 --> 06:02.340]  Oh!
[06:03.980 --> 06:05.860]  That looks so good up against him.
[06:05.860 --> 06:07.560]  It is really nice. It's from the classic...
[06:07.560 --> 06:08.900]  It's a classic fuckface right there.
[06:09.420 --> 06:10.200]  What do you think that'll run?
[06:11.080 --> 06:12.400]  I couldn't find a PSA 10, so I'm just...
[06:12.400 --> 06:13.080]  7 bucks.
[06:13.740 --> 06:13.780]  Over.
[06:14.700 --> 06:15.500]  $1.25.
[06:15.640 --> 06:17.260]  Yeah, I was pretty bummed about that.
[06:17.260 --> 06:21.340]  You remember when we opened up all those Blizzard cards?
[06:22.020 --> 06:24.060]  Oh yeah, dude, I love Blizzard so much.
[06:24.160 --> 06:27.340]  These were the war banners. These are like their relics.
[06:27.920 --> 06:29.680]  What do you think these puppies run?
[06:30.260 --> 06:32.220]  Let me see, I should have talked to Fisher before the show.
[06:33.800 --> 06:35.080]  8 bucks total.
[06:35.260 --> 06:35.540]  Over.
[06:36.080 --> 06:37.260]  About 15 bucks each.
[06:37.380 --> 06:37.780]  Wow!
[06:38.140 --> 06:39.920]  Emily, I think you're a perfect scorer.
[06:39.940 --> 06:40.600]  Yeah, you're killing it.
[06:40.600 --> 06:41.880]  Yeah, I'm really good at gambling.
[06:42.900 --> 06:44.640]  I really like the guessing game.
[06:45.740 --> 06:50.860]  I looked through all these stupid Blizzard cards to find any of them that are worth money.
[06:50.940 --> 06:53.280]  This is the GOM Spectral Parallel.
[06:53.400 --> 06:53.560]  Yeah.
[06:53.780 --> 06:54.920]  You can see it's...
[06:54.920 --> 06:55.300]  4 bucks.
[06:56.220 --> 06:56.700]  Under.
[06:56.840 --> 06:57.320]  That's my guess.
[06:57.460 --> 06:57.620]  $10.
[06:58.080 --> 06:58.980]  Oh, he won.
[06:59.500 --> 07:00.020]  She said over.
[07:00.580 --> 07:01.520]  Cracking her armor.
[07:01.760 --> 07:01.900]  Yeah.
[07:02.700 --> 07:05.700]  Here's the Illidan Spectral Parallel.
[07:06.020 --> 07:06.480]  Illidan.
[07:06.760 --> 07:07.180]  6 bucks.
[07:07.340 --> 07:07.560]  Over.
[07:08.340 --> 07:08.820]  $10.
[07:09.080 --> 07:09.480]  Damn.
[07:11.020 --> 07:12.920]  Also, somebody sent us in some cards.
[07:13.260 --> 07:15.680]  And they sent us a... we pulled a Yu Darvish top-score key.
[07:16.860 --> 07:17.620]  12 bucks.
[07:18.440 --> 07:18.820]  Over.
[07:19.480 --> 07:19.740]  $2.
[07:20.180 --> 07:21.140]  Wow, that's it?
[07:21.240 --> 07:22.280]  I know, I was a little bummed by that.
[07:22.640 --> 07:25.440]  And then the Magic Johnson AIDS card.
[07:26.560 --> 07:28.620]  Now, I found a value for this card.
[07:29.020 --> 07:29.900]  A PSA 10.
[07:30.080 --> 07:31.260]  This is clearly not a PSA 10.
[07:31.560 --> 07:34.280]  Also, this is the Green Parallel.
[07:34.400 --> 07:35.740]  I don't even know what it's called.
[07:35.740 --> 07:39.180]  But the card I saw was the base card PSA 10.
[07:39.400 --> 07:39.960]  What do you think that was?
[07:40.140 --> 07:40.360]  $1,750.
[07:41.440 --> 07:41.800]  Over.
[07:42.260 --> 07:42.620]  $30.
[07:43.240 --> 07:43.420]  Wow!
[07:44.380 --> 07:47.360]  So, if this wasn't all scratch to hell, who knows what this one was.
[07:47.720 --> 07:47.760]  Damn.
[07:47.820 --> 07:48.660]  $150 or $160.
[07:48.800 --> 07:49.320]  That's crazy.
[07:49.380 --> 07:49.800]  Pretty crazy.
[07:49.940 --> 07:50.740]  Pretty cool.
[07:50.860 --> 07:52.580]  Magic Johnson has value wherever he is.
[07:52.580 --> 07:53.340]  Yeah, not bad, right?
[07:53.680 --> 07:56.620]  Hey, that was fun doing that with cards.
[07:56.680 --> 07:57.380]  You know what else is fun?
[07:57.760 --> 07:59.000]  It's finding out if it does.
[07:59.120 --> 08:01.440]  Because Does It Do has a new season that just came out.
[08:01.780 --> 08:03.100]  And the first episode is out now.
[08:03.300 --> 08:05.600]  And if you have not watched that yet, I advise you.
[08:05.600 --> 08:07.100]  To go watch Does It Do.
[08:07.300 --> 08:08.920]  So that way you can see if it does.
[08:09.140 --> 08:10.060]  Is it like a show we do or something?
[08:10.200 --> 08:11.140]  It is a show you do.
[08:11.260 --> 08:12.260]  And you do do it.
[08:12.560 --> 08:13.120]  And it does.
[08:13.460 --> 08:14.320]  You do it with Gavin.
[08:14.440 --> 08:14.540]  Yeah.
[08:15.000 --> 08:15.900]  You guys do it.
[08:16.060 --> 08:16.420]  Finally.
[08:16.760 --> 08:16.880]  Yeah.
[08:16.880 --> 08:17.860]  And then, uh...
[08:17.860 --> 08:19.000]  I love you.
[08:19.340 --> 08:19.680]  I love you.
[08:19.800 --> 08:21.040]  I'm gonna slow-mo kiss you.
[08:21.340 --> 08:21.820]  I'm gonna...
[08:21.820 --> 08:22.700]  I'm gonna...
[08:23.300 --> 08:24.760]  Give me your little penis.
[08:24.940 --> 08:25.220]  Okay?
[08:25.440 --> 08:28.180]  And then by the end, you guys are just covered in each other's stickiness.
[08:28.440 --> 08:28.640]  Yeah.
[08:28.800 --> 08:30.140]  It's a very sticky show.
[08:30.240 --> 08:31.840]  And you can watch it at fuckfacepod.com.
[08:32.060 --> 08:33.380]  Or right here on our YouTube channel.
[08:33.540 --> 08:34.060]  It's out now.
[08:34.140 --> 08:34.720]  Go check it out.
[08:34.720 --> 08:36.160]  Because Shady Rays is a sponsor.
[08:36.580 --> 08:37.400]  And it was a lot of fun.
[08:37.600 --> 08:38.440]  And Gracie did a great job.
[08:38.500 --> 08:39.380]  It was Gracie's first production.
[08:39.620 --> 08:40.840]  And it's not porn.
[08:42.440 --> 08:43.540]  It could be.
[08:44.240 --> 08:46.940]  Gracie's mom is commenting on Instagrams.
[08:47.660 --> 08:48.100]  Yay!
[08:50.060 --> 08:53.640]  Gracie's in a Rooster Teeth Instagram video that we did for Face Jam.
[08:53.720 --> 08:54.980]  And her mom was like,
[08:55.020 --> 08:57.000]  If Gracie doesn't like it, I don't like it.
[08:57.240 --> 08:58.360]  Oh, I love it.
[08:58.380 --> 08:58.900]  Gracie replied,
[08:59.040 --> 08:59.460]  Thanks, Mom.
[08:59.620 --> 09:00.180]  Thanks, Mom.
[09:00.960 --> 09:02.460]  We love a supportive parent.
[09:02.520 --> 09:02.900]  Yeah, we do.
[09:03.100 --> 09:03.780]  I wanna get a good...
[09:03.780 --> 09:04.540]  Shout out to my mom.
[09:04.620 --> 09:04.980]  Hi, Mom.
[09:05.020 --> 09:05.460]  Hi, Mom.
[09:05.600 --> 09:05.940]  I love you.
[09:05.960 --> 09:06.460]  Hi, Jackie.
[09:08.480 --> 09:09.500]  She's got a new flashlight.
[09:12.720 --> 09:13.960]  Tell me about it.
[09:14.020 --> 09:14.480]  Tell me...
[09:14.480 --> 09:15.780]  Tell me about...
[09:17.260 --> 09:18.460]  For hurricanes and stuff.
[09:19.380 --> 09:21.720]  Is it one of those ones that you have to hand crank?
[09:22.340 --> 09:22.640]  Oh, God.
[09:22.640 --> 09:24.200]  I think it might have a radio on it, too.
[09:24.840 --> 09:25.480]  That is...
[09:25.480 --> 09:25.880]  You know what?
[09:26.100 --> 09:27.760]  We love a survivalist.
[09:28.560 --> 09:29.840]  That made Eric choke.
[09:29.940 --> 09:30.960]  We lost Eric for a second there.
[09:31.780 --> 09:33.040]  Pulled out from the pack sack.
[09:33.040 --> 09:36.220]  As you know, every week, we pull a pack from the pack sack.
[09:36.600 --> 09:37.920]  And it gifts us treasure.
[09:39.100 --> 09:40.000]  Eric's not well.
[09:40.380 --> 09:41.780]  Eric has a problem with water.
[09:42.120 --> 09:42.440]  You know this.
[09:42.440 --> 09:44.160]  Oh, the Critter's is still here.
[09:45.760 --> 09:47.000]  It's like the Phantom of the Opera.
[09:47.560 --> 09:50.000]  The news with your mom is she got a new flashlight.
[09:53.720 --> 09:54.620]  She lives in...
[09:54.620 --> 09:55.340]  Oh, it's so funny.
[09:55.440 --> 09:56.200]  She lives on the Gulf Coast.
[09:56.280 --> 09:57.180]  Don't worry about hurricanes down there.
[09:57.760 --> 10:00.140]  Okay, so here's a pack of 2022...
[10:01.500 --> 10:02.620]  Jesus Christ.
[10:02.760 --> 10:03.580]  Now I'm all wet.
[10:03.740 --> 10:04.460]  Fuck, dude.
[10:04.740 --> 10:05.900]  That was so funny.
[10:06.220 --> 10:07.280]  What a fucking...
[10:07.780 --> 10:08.560]  What an update.
[10:08.820 --> 10:09.900]  She got a new flashlight.
[10:10.920 --> 10:14.340]  I think that needs to be our new segment.
[10:14.660 --> 10:16.140]  It's like, what's our Jackie update?
[10:17.780 --> 10:19.140]  Sharp bass rookie.
[10:19.860 --> 10:20.420]  SGA.
[10:20.980 --> 10:22.560]  Ooh, chat rookie.
[10:23.160 --> 10:23.720]  Currently...
[10:23.720 --> 10:24.980]  He might end up in the rookie of the year.
[10:25.080 --> 10:26.400]  Let's go ahead and sleeve this.
[10:28.460 --> 10:29.580]  Jalen Suggs.
[10:30.760 --> 10:33.260]  Becoming a hell of a defensive player this year.
[10:33.580 --> 10:35.020]  Ooh, Cam Thomas.
[10:35.180 --> 10:37.200]  Does not play for that team anymore.
[10:38.280 --> 10:39.820]  Oh, Davis Bertons.
[10:40.080 --> 10:42.220]  The human cartoon villain man.
[10:42.520 --> 10:43.400]  Norm Powell.
[10:43.800 --> 10:45.600]  Why would you name a kid Norm?
[10:45.980 --> 10:46.420]  Norm!
[10:46.680 --> 10:47.080]  So you can do that.
[10:47.280 --> 10:47.820]  Yeah, I guess so.
[10:48.060 --> 10:48.880]  Danny Green.
[10:49.740 --> 10:50.620]  Gordon Hayward.
[10:50.740 --> 10:52.340]  Remember when he was a player in the NBA?
[10:52.580 --> 10:53.940]  Remember when he cracked his...
[10:53.940 --> 10:55.220]  Like, snapped his ankle on TV?
[10:55.360 --> 10:56.280]  Unfortunately, I watched enough.
[10:58.340 --> 10:59.560]  120-inch screen.
[10:59.780 --> 11:00.360]  Millie and I did it.
[11:00.420 --> 11:01.360]  It was fucking horrible.
[11:01.680 --> 11:02.100]  Go backwards.
[11:02.260 --> 11:03.360]  His leg was bigger than his leg.
[11:04.060 --> 11:05.120]  Pat Connaughton on the screen.
[11:05.200 --> 11:05.600]  We watched it on.
[11:05.840 --> 11:06.740]  Peyton Pritchard.
[11:07.080 --> 11:08.320]  Fast P, as I call him these days.
[11:09.040 --> 11:09.760]  Isaiah Livers.
[11:09.960 --> 11:10.840]  Still struggling.
[11:11.200 --> 11:11.360]  Yeah.
[11:11.580 --> 11:12.160]  It's gonna be okay.
[11:12.180 --> 11:12.760]  Really got me.
[11:13.900 --> 11:14.620]  Dylan Brooks.
[11:14.720 --> 11:15.740]  Purple Parallel.
[11:15.760 --> 11:16.340]  Sleeve that.
[11:16.720 --> 11:17.760]  He's a...
[11:18.180 --> 11:19.040]  Villain of the NBA.
[11:19.300 --> 11:19.640]  Why?
[11:19.800 --> 11:20.320]  Yeah, it's fun.
[11:20.460 --> 11:20.980]  What's his deal?
[11:21.100 --> 11:21.560]  He's just a badass.
[11:21.660 --> 11:23.080]  He's like a Draymond kind of guy.
[11:23.200 --> 11:23.440]  Yeah.
[11:23.680 --> 11:24.040]  Sour.
[11:24.040 --> 11:24.480]  Sour.
[11:24.480 --> 11:26.340]  So, Draymond is just back and not fussing around.
[11:26.340 --> 11:27.160]  He's back, baby.
[11:27.400 --> 11:30.560]  And he's trying to punch Anthony Davis.
[11:30.980 --> 11:31.080]  Yeah.
[11:31.260 --> 11:31.760]  Was he?
[11:31.920 --> 11:32.320]  Yeah.
[11:32.640 --> 11:33.180]  He tried to.
[11:33.200 --> 11:34.060]  Even after he came back?
[11:34.400 --> 11:35.400]  Yeah, it was pretty close.
[11:35.520 --> 11:36.340]  You had to see him go,
[11:36.380 --> 11:37.140]  Ugh, don't do it.
[11:37.360 --> 11:38.160]  Don't do it.
[11:38.180 --> 11:38.440]  He goes,
[11:38.880 --> 11:39.280]  Ugh!
[11:41.240 --> 11:42.260]  Look at this guy!
[11:42.700 --> 11:43.800]  Can't control the head.
[11:44.000 --> 11:44.840]  Controlling a snake.
[11:45.060 --> 11:45.200]  You're like,
[11:45.260 --> 11:45.540]  Ugh!
[11:46.200 --> 11:47.260]  It was great.
[11:47.360 --> 11:48.380]  Like Jim Carrey in Liarly.
[11:48.740 --> 11:48.840]  Ugh!
[11:48.980 --> 11:49.620]  Can't control.
[11:50.240 --> 11:52.380]  It really was...
[11:52.880 --> 11:54.020]  What's the guy's name?
[11:54.020 --> 11:55.500]  What's the other guy?
[11:55.740 --> 11:57.180]  The guy from Princess Bride?
[11:58.340 --> 11:59.100]  Andre the Giant.
[11:59.200 --> 11:59.500]  No.
[11:59.680 --> 12:00.660]  Mandy Pankin.
[12:01.020 --> 12:01.800]  Carrie S...
[12:01.800 --> 12:02.640]  Carrie Ells.
[12:02.660 --> 12:03.160]  Is that his name?
[12:03.180 --> 12:03.380]  Yeah.
[12:03.640 --> 12:06.940]  Because he's like the stepfather or whatever in that.
[12:07.040 --> 12:08.100]  And I love when he goes like,
[12:08.180 --> 12:10.980]  Oh, the claw is coming to get you.
[12:11.200 --> 12:12.180]  And the kid's like,
[12:12.240 --> 12:13.300]  This fucking guy.
[12:13.460 --> 12:14.020]  That's funny.
[12:14.160 --> 12:14.540]  That's great.
[12:14.600 --> 12:15.060]  That's a good moment.
[12:15.860 --> 12:16.740]  Cookie Remembrance?
[12:16.780 --> 12:19.260]  Hold a Jalen Green relic card.
[12:19.340 --> 12:19.580]  Mem card.
[12:19.780 --> 12:21.240]  Let's see if it's from...
[12:21.240 --> 12:21.600]  Let's see.
[12:21.600 --> 12:29.780]  The enclosed, officially licensed material is not associated with any specific player, game, or event.
[12:30.120 --> 12:38.340]  So here we have a piece of what appears to be Jalen Green's rookie jersey, but on the back it says,
[12:38.520 --> 12:39.000]  Probably not.
[12:39.140 --> 12:39.620]  They went to...
[12:39.620 --> 12:40.020]  Really?
[12:40.360 --> 12:48.980]  They went to Dick's Sporting Goods, started grabbing the scissors and cutting it up, and just put them in the back of cards.
[12:49.240 --> 12:49.740]  Wow.
[12:49.740 --> 12:52.020]  One of the reasons people shit on Panini.
[12:52.300 --> 12:53.280]  A very good reason, too.
[12:53.680 --> 12:54.680]  So, but now...
[12:54.680 --> 12:55.400]  Like, let's fucking do it.
[12:55.720 --> 12:56.740]  Next year, Panini...
[12:57.580 --> 12:58.980]  It's Topps has NBA, right?
[13:00.060 --> 13:01.640]  Well, Fanatics has NBA.
[13:01.840 --> 13:03.800]  Fanatics owns Topps now.
[13:04.280 --> 13:05.120]  So we'll see.
[13:05.200 --> 13:06.700]  I think that's going to be a little bit down the road.
[13:06.780 --> 13:08.520]  2024, 2025, or 2020.
[13:08.620 --> 13:11.360]  So next year, things won't be Panini.
[13:11.600 --> 13:12.200]  I'm not sure.
[13:12.520 --> 13:12.760]  Okay.
[13:12.820 --> 13:14.660]  I don't know yet how it's going to shake out.
[13:15.000 --> 13:15.680]  Stay tuned.
[13:15.800 --> 13:16.960]  What do we got next, Geoff?
[13:16.960 --> 13:18.260]  Let's have some fun.
[13:19.020 --> 13:21.240]  That's finally for the first time on this show.
[13:21.340 --> 13:21.760]  Let's open...
[13:21.760 --> 13:22.520]  We're going to do it, guys.
[13:23.300 --> 13:23.620]  ...this.
[13:23.900 --> 13:24.220]  Okay.
[13:25.080 --> 13:27.160]  Country Classic Series 1.
[13:27.260 --> 13:27.360]  Yay.
[13:28.340 --> 13:30.160]  Special subsets, autographs, and gold cards.
[13:30.240 --> 13:31.780]  Holy shit, there's chase cards in this.
[13:31.800 --> 13:33.200]  There's never chase cards in these things.
[13:33.260 --> 13:34.480]  I hope it's a gold Tanya.
[13:35.120 --> 13:35.760]  I want to get...
[13:35.760 --> 13:38.780]  Hey, Williams Jr. on card auto?
[13:38.840 --> 13:40.220]  I want to get a 101 Dolly auto.
[13:40.280 --> 13:40.740]  Oh, my.
[13:40.780 --> 13:41.380]  I would die.
[13:41.440 --> 13:41.620]  Good luck.
[13:41.620 --> 13:42.460]  I would die.
[13:43.120 --> 13:44.380]  Can we get a Dollywood this year?
[13:44.460 --> 13:45.160]  Lee Greenwood, sure.
[13:45.160 --> 13:45.900]  I would love to, yeah.
[13:45.900 --> 13:46.740]  Make a 64 one.
[13:46.860 --> 13:47.340]  They won't...
[13:47.340 --> 13:48.620]  They will not shut up about it.
[13:48.680 --> 13:49.460]  They fucking loved it.
[13:49.480 --> 13:49.980]  Where did they go?
[13:50.140 --> 13:52.420]  They went on tour last year?
[13:52.560 --> 13:52.960]  Or the year before?
[13:53.100 --> 13:53.420]  Let's fuck...
[13:53.420 --> 13:54.080]  Let's do...
[13:54.640 --> 13:55.280]  Fuckface thing there.
[13:55.300 --> 13:58.180]  Does Barbara like amusement parks like that?
[13:59.040 --> 14:00.580]  I think she's probably medium on them.
[14:01.000 --> 14:01.980]  I think she would have fun.
[14:02.360 --> 14:03.260]  Especially if we're all together.
[14:03.420 --> 14:03.620]  Yeah, exactly.
[14:03.740 --> 14:04.360]  Plus, it's like...
[14:04.360 --> 14:04.560]  Yeah.
[14:05.620 --> 14:07.220]  Go out to the Appalachian Mountains.
[14:07.480 --> 14:08.600]  You know, think about Lee Greenwood.
[14:09.000 --> 14:09.980]  He's proud to be an American.
[14:09.980 --> 14:10.400]  Proud to be an American.
[14:10.680 --> 14:10.860]  Yep.
[14:11.180 --> 14:14.980]  That's how you knew it was Friday at my elementary school was they played that song over the
[14:14.980 --> 14:15.760]  loudspeaker.
[14:16.340 --> 14:21.360]  I think I've told this in other places before, but when I was in the Army at Fort Hood, one
[14:21.360 --> 14:25.660]  of the first jobs, recurring jobs I had to do in public affairs was every month there
[14:25.660 --> 14:30.800]  would be an in-processing assembly where they would bring soldiers and their wives and their
[14:30.800 --> 14:33.040]  kids in to a movie theater and you'd have to fucking...
[14:33.040 --> 14:33.600]  Propaganda?
[14:33.900 --> 14:34.940]  Yeah, well, they would put up a...
[14:34.940 --> 14:37.120]  They'd make them watch a slide show.
[14:37.240 --> 14:38.080]  Like, with slides.
[14:39.000 --> 14:39.680]  Chook-chook!
[14:39.960 --> 14:40.580]  Chook-chook!
[14:40.800 --> 14:41.500]  Chook-chook!
[14:41.620 --> 14:42.140]  Chook-chook!
[14:42.140 --> 14:45.000]  And it would be like a montage of shit from Fort Hood.
[14:45.580 --> 14:46.120]  Like, guys...
[14:46.120 --> 14:50.560]  You know, just like jets fighting and helicopters and dust and fucking howitzers.
[14:50.580 --> 14:51.840]  Hugh Heffengast in the back.
[14:51.860 --> 14:52.780]  Hugh Heffengast in the back.
[14:53.360 --> 14:54.460]  And it would be like...
[14:54.460 --> 14:57.080]  And then somebody would come out and like the chaplain would come out and he'd be like,
[14:57.120 --> 14:58.600]  where's the services the chaplain offers?
[14:58.800 --> 15:01.520]  And then somebody would come out and go like, be sure to go by the PX and get your discount.
[15:01.600 --> 15:02.160]  You know, and all that.
[15:02.720 --> 15:05.720]  And my responsibility was to set up the slide show.
[15:05.780 --> 15:06.540]  I had to set up the screen.
[15:06.580 --> 15:06.840]  Oh, really?
[15:06.840 --> 15:09.420]  They wouldn't let me use the movie theater screen, even though we were in a movie theater.
[15:09.760 --> 15:11.560]  So I had to set up these screens I had to rent.
[15:11.560 --> 15:12.300]  They were like vinyl.
[15:12.400 --> 15:13.100]  What a stupid thing.
[15:13.420 --> 15:13.600]  Yeah.
[15:13.700 --> 15:15.560]  And then I was the guy that I sat behind and went...
[15:16.300 --> 15:16.620]  Yep.
[15:16.780 --> 15:19.340]  And if I got it wrong, my boss would sit in the audience.
[15:19.460 --> 15:21.660]  And if I got it wrong, because he created the slide show, I'd be proud of it.
[15:21.760 --> 15:25.620]  If I fucked it up, he'd make me do it over and over again until I learned better.
[15:26.660 --> 15:28.380]  Sounds like something he should have just done.
[15:28.880 --> 15:31.000]  And it was the goddamn proud to be an American song.
[15:31.100 --> 15:31.560]  That's why...
[15:31.560 --> 15:31.800]  Of course.
[15:31.900 --> 15:32.700]  Bring it all back around.
[15:32.820 --> 15:36.380]  So I had to hear this song 150 billion times.
[15:36.540 --> 15:37.140]  Merle Haggard.
[15:37.740 --> 15:38.380]  All right.
[15:38.680 --> 15:39.800]  Hank Williams Jr.
[15:39.980 --> 15:41.300]  All right, there he is.
[15:41.300 --> 15:41.740]  Got his dad.
[15:42.000 --> 15:43.000]  Beau Cephas.
[15:44.560 --> 15:45.200]  George Jones.
[15:45.680 --> 15:46.240]  There he is.
[15:46.320 --> 15:46.920]  The possum.
[15:47.400 --> 15:47.520]  Yep.
[15:47.820 --> 15:48.820]  The fucking possum.
[15:49.400 --> 15:49.880]  White Lightning.
[15:50.280 --> 15:51.500]  No show Jones, baby.
[15:51.840 --> 15:53.000]  Dude, these are some heavy hitters.
[15:54.020 --> 15:54.660]  Gary Norris.
[15:55.060 --> 15:56.840]  You know, it's so crazy how they make out...
[15:56.840 --> 15:57.640]  Gene Autry.
[15:58.440 --> 15:59.080]  Him and...
[15:59.440 --> 16:01.040]  Who was the one that he was in love with?
[16:01.160 --> 16:01.420]  I'm just lost.
[16:01.500 --> 16:02.080]  Kenya Tucker.
[16:02.600 --> 16:06.020]  Yeah, and that they were like so obsessed with each other.
[16:06.100 --> 16:06.580]  And they meant to be.
[16:06.600 --> 16:07.400]  And he's there to look at her.
[16:07.480 --> 16:09.860]  But it was really his like second or third.
[16:09.940 --> 16:11.240]  Like, they weren't married for that long.
[16:11.240 --> 16:14.460]  But it was actually his other wife that like got him to show up to shows on time.
[16:14.660 --> 16:15.580]  And like actually do stuff.
[16:15.660 --> 16:16.520]  And like who he's married next to.
[16:16.520 --> 16:19.220]  Hey, put the drink down and get out there.
[16:19.220 --> 16:19.500]  Yeah.
[16:19.680 --> 16:20.820]  She's like one possum.
[16:20.840 --> 16:21.540]  Oh, if you insist.
[16:21.780 --> 16:21.980]  Yeah.
[16:22.360 --> 16:23.720]  Somebody sent us these last week.
[16:23.800 --> 16:24.920]  I think in the mail or recently.
[16:25.120 --> 16:27.240]  2023 National Hockey Card Day.
[16:27.380 --> 16:28.040]  Neck pack.
[16:28.240 --> 16:29.900]  I think we opened one already.
[16:29.980 --> 16:30.460]  Pretty sure.
[16:30.600 --> 16:31.140]  Let's see what we got.
[16:31.240 --> 16:31.880]  This pack.
[16:32.500 --> 16:33.660]  Oh, Legends of the Ice.
[16:33.980 --> 16:34.660]  I've heard of this guy.
[16:34.760 --> 16:35.580]  Wayne Gretzky.
[16:35.720 --> 16:36.120]  Never heard of him.
[16:36.200 --> 16:36.300]  Hey!
[16:36.300 --> 16:37.740]  They call him the really good one.
[16:38.000 --> 16:38.940]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[16:39.700 --> 16:40.740]  That's a young one.
[16:40.740 --> 16:42.980]  He played for the Kings when I was growing up.
[16:43.080 --> 16:44.460]  My dad was a huge fan.
[16:44.520 --> 16:45.940]  And my sister had a total crush on him.
[16:45.960 --> 16:46.940]  He was an oily boy then.
[16:47.080 --> 16:47.320]  Yeah.
[16:49.440 --> 16:50.160]  Andre Cusmento.
[16:50.860 --> 16:51.580]  Marc Messier.
[16:52.000 --> 16:53.860]  Oh, these are the heavy hitters.
[16:55.000 --> 16:55.720]  Alex Ovechkin.
[16:55.760 --> 16:56.500]  These are like 94?
[16:56.800 --> 16:57.280]  What are these?
[16:57.520 --> 16:58.720]  I don't know where these came from.
[16:59.360 --> 17:00.540]  I think it's just like a greatest hits type thing.
[17:01.120 --> 17:01.840]  Shane Wright.
[17:01.940 --> 17:02.220]  Oh, yeah.
[17:02.280 --> 17:03.880]  These are new because there's the Krakens.
[17:03.980 --> 17:05.900]  It's like the entire 31 card set.
[17:06.000 --> 17:06.440]  There you go.
[17:06.580 --> 17:06.860]  Okay.
[17:07.300 --> 17:10.320]  Here's a pack of, you know, this is Top Stadium Club.
[17:10.320 --> 17:10.720]  Okay.
[17:11.200 --> 17:11.560]  1994.
[17:12.320 --> 17:13.640]  Here's what I remember about this pack.
[17:13.700 --> 17:13.900]  Okay.
[17:14.120 --> 17:17.720]  I bought this pack in Marine City, Michigan at an antique store.
[17:17.780 --> 17:18.940]  Ah, I remember when we went there.
[17:19.020 --> 17:19.140]  Yeah.
[17:19.820 --> 17:20.720]  But he was very nice.
[17:20.920 --> 17:22.400]  I went back in and bought more cards from him.
[17:22.640 --> 17:24.240]  I was buying fudge next door.
[17:24.300 --> 17:24.660]  Nice.
[17:24.840 --> 17:25.820]  Emily was buying the fudge.
[17:25.880 --> 17:27.380]  How's the weather in Michigan right now?
[17:27.600 --> 17:28.120]  It's icy.
[17:28.380 --> 17:28.900]  It's cold.
[17:29.180 --> 17:30.480]  But it's 70 degrees in Austin today.
[17:30.500 --> 17:31.040]  It's beautiful.
[17:31.260 --> 17:31.940]  Dude, it was hot.
[17:32.000 --> 17:32.960]  Yeah, I heard you popped your shirt off yesterday.
[17:33.240 --> 17:35.560]  Oh, I popped the tarp and I went out back.
[17:35.700 --> 17:36.340]  You popped the tarp?
[17:36.400 --> 17:37.880]  Oh, yeah, I took that shirt off.
[17:37.880 --> 17:39.700]  Oh, I thought you like laid out a tarp.
[17:39.700 --> 17:40.300]  No way.
[17:40.520 --> 17:41.580]  Took that shirt off.
[17:41.800 --> 17:42.580]  Hung out in the sunshine.
[17:42.840 --> 17:44.000]  You did that the other day, too.
[17:44.040 --> 17:45.360]  That's why I got inspired.
[17:45.980 --> 17:46.840]  This is the big hurt.
[17:46.880 --> 17:47.980]  I'm a beefer or whatever.
[17:48.520 --> 17:49.320]  Oh, fuck yeah.
[17:49.320 --> 17:50.000]  Me and Big Beefy.
[17:50.220 --> 17:51.020]  That is...
[17:51.020 --> 17:52.760]  Uh, 93 award winners, whatever.
[17:53.060 --> 17:53.340]  Cool.
[17:53.500 --> 17:54.720]  Uh, Danny Tartable.
[17:55.120 --> 17:55.640]  Aw, damn.
[17:55.800 --> 17:56.520]  That's such a cool name.
[17:56.520 --> 17:56.720]  Fuck it.
[17:56.760 --> 17:59.060]  Here's a cool name for a player I've never heard of, I must admit.
[18:00.160 --> 18:01.720]  Uh, is this two cards stuck together?
[18:01.820 --> 18:02.080]  Yes.
[18:03.120 --> 18:03.980]  God damn it.
[18:04.180 --> 18:05.080]  These old ass cards.
[18:05.240 --> 18:05.360]  Okay.
[18:05.580 --> 18:06.080]  Mm-hmm.
[18:06.420 --> 18:08.620]  Uh, Jayhawk Owens.
[18:08.920 --> 18:09.180]  Wow.
[18:09.180 --> 18:10.620]  You know who Jayhawk Owens is?
[18:10.860 --> 18:11.340]  No, it's a...
[18:11.340 --> 18:12.180]  Played for the...
[18:13.360 --> 18:14.520]  Jayhawk is a great first name.
[18:14.540 --> 18:15.440]  Colorado Rockies.
[18:15.500 --> 18:16.420]  That's a good baseball name right there.
[18:16.420 --> 18:18.420]  Dude, he ripped his mask off to throw that to you.
[18:18.440 --> 18:18.920]  Fuck yeah, he did.
[18:19.540 --> 18:20.940]  Uh, Kevin Roberts...
[18:20.940 --> 18:21.660]  Robertson.
[18:23.240 --> 18:24.340]  Uh, Mike Stanton.
[18:25.580 --> 18:26.460]  Ron Darling.
[18:28.040 --> 18:28.920]  Gene Harris.
[18:29.300 --> 18:30.720]  Ooh, Chris Hammond rookie, yes.
[18:30.720 --> 18:35.480]  The type or like the text on it, on the back especially, is so of a time.
[18:35.520 --> 18:36.220]  Like so like...
[18:36.220 --> 18:36.720]  That's like early 90s.
[18:36.720 --> 18:37.400]  So 1994?
[18:37.400 --> 18:40.860]  A bunch of different fonts and like...
[18:40.860 --> 18:41.380]  Hey, check it out.
[18:41.440 --> 18:42.220]  This makes you insane.
[18:42.340 --> 18:43.040]  Drink a Surge.
[18:43.220 --> 18:46.480]  Yeah, it should say at the bottom, it should say, designed in Photoshop 3.0.
[18:46.540 --> 18:49.180]  Everything, it looks like the old Cherry Coke.
[18:49.420 --> 18:51.900]  The whole fucking back just looks like the way Cherry Coke looked.
[18:52.240 --> 18:52.960]  Tim Hewlett.
[18:54.560 --> 18:55.860]  His angel in the outfield.
[18:56.900 --> 18:57.360]  There you go.
[18:58.040 --> 18:59.020]  Uh, ooh, John Patterson.
[18:59.100 --> 19:00.100]  This is some sort of a parallel.
[19:00.700 --> 19:02.420]  A silver foil parallel there.
[19:02.660 --> 19:03.860]  And then...
[19:03.860 --> 19:04.440]  Ricky Bones!
[19:05.180 --> 19:06.560]  Hey, that's a good one.
[19:06.880 --> 19:07.320]  Body part.
[19:07.320 --> 19:07.780]  Body part, big time.
[19:07.980 --> 19:08.720]  We can build a human out of it.
[19:08.760 --> 19:09.520]  We can build a human this year.
[19:09.600 --> 19:10.360]  That's what we're going to do in 2024.
[19:10.580 --> 19:11.320]  We're going to build a human.
[19:11.680 --> 19:14.740]  Gracie just did a really good job of getting a display case that we're going to be hanging
[19:14.740 --> 19:15.720]  up, figuring out.
[19:16.080 --> 19:17.060]  Yeah, so we can show it all off.
[19:17.100 --> 19:18.320]  So we can show off a lot of stuff.
[19:18.340 --> 19:18.880]  Of the cool stuff.
[19:18.880 --> 19:21.680]  Yeah, they're going to hate the glare that comes across from it, but, you know.
[19:22.140 --> 19:22.660]  Well, they will.
[19:22.860 --> 19:23.660]  We won't.
[19:23.780 --> 19:24.120]  Sorry, Justin.
[19:24.140 --> 19:25.240]  Why don't you just take the glass off?
[19:25.280 --> 19:27.520]  Here's some mail we got.
[19:27.780 --> 19:28.520]  We got some mail?
[19:28.940 --> 19:29.840]  Yeah, we got this the other week.
[19:29.900 --> 19:30.680]  Somebody made these things.
[19:31.120 --> 19:31.980]  What are you doing?
[19:33.020 --> 19:33.580]  Emily's Pick.
[19:34.420 --> 19:34.700]  Ooh!
[19:35.200 --> 19:35.960]  Oh my God!
[19:37.560 --> 19:39.380]  Oh, we'll put them in the display case!
[19:39.600 --> 19:40.540]  We got Gus's Pick.
[19:40.860 --> 19:41.560]  Eric's Pick.
[19:42.040 --> 19:43.360]  So, we got the...
[19:43.360 --> 19:44.300]  Oh, hell yeah!
[19:44.300 --> 19:44.840]  These are so cool.
[19:44.960 --> 19:46.320]  Zimmer for Don Zimmer.
[19:46.540 --> 19:47.340]  Oh, these are really cool.
[19:47.500 --> 19:47.760]  We got food.
[19:47.980 --> 19:48.780]  We got law firm.
[19:48.920 --> 19:49.420]  We got game game.
[19:49.420 --> 19:50.240]  We got the Dench.
[19:50.320 --> 19:50.800]  These are great.
[19:50.980 --> 19:51.760]  Dame Judy Dench.
[19:51.780 --> 19:53.060]  Oh, these are going to go in the display case.
[19:53.160 --> 19:53.980]  Best in Show.
[19:54.060 --> 19:54.220]  Yeah.
[19:54.520 --> 19:55.300]  Worst in Show.
[19:55.460 --> 19:56.980]  See, this is what I'm talking about.
[19:57.060 --> 19:58.820]  And then we can just, like, they're magnetic.
[19:59.060 --> 20:00.740]  So you can be like, boom, high leg.
[20:01.560 --> 20:02.660]  This is from...
[20:02.660 --> 20:03.420]  How effin' cool is that?
[20:03.500 --> 20:03.860]  Chris.
[20:04.440 --> 20:05.080]  Thank you.
[20:05.080 --> 20:05.860]  Chris.
[20:06.380 --> 20:08.560]  I think this note was probably from those,
[20:08.700 --> 20:09.780]  because you dumped everything out.
[20:10.020 --> 20:10.360]  Yeah, it was.
[20:10.700 --> 20:11.680]  Alongside the card stands,
[20:11.740 --> 20:13.560]  I've included a couple packs of cards for you.
[20:14.060 --> 20:15.760]  My original parcel got lost somewhere
[20:15.760 --> 20:17.260]  around Stage 5 last year,
[20:17.340 --> 20:18.700]  but I hope these will suffice.
[20:19.100 --> 20:19.380]  Dude, they're perfect.
[20:19.420 --> 20:20.180]  Dude, that happens.
[20:20.200 --> 20:20.840]  Fucking British.
[20:21.000 --> 20:21.720]  Things get lost.
[20:22.460 --> 20:23.780]  Within the cards is a...
[20:23.780 --> 20:25.700]  Wait, within the cards is a card of Vinny Jones?
[20:25.980 --> 20:26.800]  Oh, man.
[20:26.980 --> 20:28.460]  I can't believe that guy was an actual football player.
[20:28.460 --> 20:29.580]  Oh, Vinny VinVin.
[20:29.620 --> 20:30.600]  There he is right there.
[20:30.760 --> 20:31.020]  There he is.
[20:31.480 --> 20:32.660]  Bullet tooth Tony himself.
[20:32.780 --> 20:33.380]  Yeah, there you go.
[20:34.460 --> 20:35.460]  Who didn't get...
[20:35.460 --> 20:38.020]  I didn't get that it was the joke that he was a footballer.
[20:38.180 --> 20:40.520]  Just thought he was a tough looking actor guy.
[20:40.700 --> 20:42.400]  Should I just put my favorite card on here?
[20:42.440 --> 20:42.820]  Yeah, sure.
[20:43.000 --> 20:44.520]  Whatever your pick of the week is,
[20:44.560 --> 20:46.060]  you can put it on Emily's pick and set it right there.
[20:46.140 --> 20:47.020]  Or we'll put it in the display case.
[20:47.020 --> 20:48.360]  Oh, we'll definitely put it in the display case.
[20:48.360 --> 20:49.160]  I feel like I'll put it right there.
[20:49.260 --> 20:51.920]  And they also sent in American Gladiator cards,
[20:53.200 --> 20:53.840]  Lego cards,
[20:54.260 --> 20:56.600]  and then a bunch of 1991 NFL Pro Soccer.
[20:56.620 --> 20:58.240]  Well, you gotta feed the pack sack,
[20:58.360 --> 20:59.680]  so you gotta figure that out and then...
[20:59.680 --> 21:00.700]  Put the two in the pack sack.
[21:00.720 --> 21:00.800]  There you go.
[21:01.600 --> 21:02.560]  And then let's open up these locks.
[21:02.560 --> 21:04.280]  I've never even heard of these Lego cards before.
[21:04.400 --> 21:05.140]  I forgot to...
[21:05.140 --> 21:05.740]  Oh, boy.
[21:06.780 --> 21:09.600]  Red, brick, gray, square.
[21:09.840 --> 21:11.300]  Ooh, what about the little thingamajig?
[21:11.300 --> 21:11.940]  Man with brown hair.
[21:13.260 --> 21:14.140]  Okay, here we go.
[21:15.200 --> 21:15.620]  Uh...
[21:15.620 --> 21:16.640]  There's a programmer.
[21:17.180 --> 21:19.480]  One, zero, one, one, zero, one, zero, one, one, one.
[21:19.800 --> 21:20.840]  She's a material girl.
[21:20.900 --> 21:21.480]  This is fun.
[21:21.600 --> 21:22.840]  Living in a digital world.
[21:23.220 --> 21:24.480]  Here is a...
[21:24.940 --> 21:27.240]  Ooh, a fox costume girl.
[21:27.440 --> 21:28.720]  Ooh, it got the chicken.
[21:29.180 --> 21:31.220]  This is like a Dragon Con kind of thing, right?
[21:31.220 --> 21:31.620]  Yeah.
[21:31.720 --> 21:33.080]  Dude, check this shit out.
[21:33.160 --> 21:33.340]  Cool.
[21:34.140 --> 21:34.560]  Wheelbarrow.
[21:34.740 --> 21:35.160]  Oh.
[21:35.400 --> 21:36.460]  We gotta save that.
[21:36.500 --> 21:36.880]  Pretty cool card.
[21:37.120 --> 21:37.500]  Wheelbarrow card.
[21:37.680 --> 21:39.020]  You're gonna love that.
[21:39.400 --> 21:44.480]  Wait till you take a look at the crack-dice silver parallel of corncob guy.
[21:44.580 --> 21:44.660]  Hell yeah.
[21:46.260 --> 21:47.480]  Yo, that's awesome.
[21:47.700 --> 21:48.600]  The corncob guy.
[21:48.600 --> 21:49.000]  Yo, that rocks.
[21:49.100 --> 21:49.140]  Hell yeah.
[21:49.140 --> 21:50.520]  That's part of your day so far.
[21:50.580 --> 21:51.440]  It's Geoff's pick, so...
[21:52.620 --> 21:54.020]  That's fucking awesome.
[21:54.180 --> 21:54.820]  Corncob guy.
[21:54.940 --> 21:56.280]  Corncob guy's in there, baby.
[21:56.400 --> 21:56.840]  That's my dude.
[21:56.920 --> 21:57.460]  That's pretty cool.
[21:57.780 --> 21:58.320]  I like that.
[21:58.420 --> 22:00.700]  I need to take you to the corncob arena.
[22:01.320 --> 22:02.800]  The fuck did you just say?
[22:02.940 --> 22:02.960]  Yeah.
[22:02.960 --> 22:08.620]  Yeah, I think it's in, like, Iowa or something where there's an entire arena, like cute, like
[22:08.620 --> 22:11.160]  basketball-sized arena made out of corncobs.
[22:11.380 --> 22:12.740]  I think it's called, like, the corn palace.
[22:13.020 --> 22:13.420]  Yeah.
[22:13.460 --> 22:14.380]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[22:14.760 --> 22:16.240]  I desperately want to go.
[22:16.260 --> 22:19.440]  And, like, the whole wall, you just, like, walk and it's just dried corncobs.
[22:19.880 --> 22:20.380]  That's pretty cool.
[22:21.180 --> 22:21.420]  Gross.
[22:21.540 --> 22:23.800]  Do you think that's, like, the cow palace is, like, the same thing?
[22:23.940 --> 22:25.940]  It's just dried shit everywhere.
[22:26.540 --> 22:26.940]  Bones.
[22:26.940 --> 22:27.840]  Merry gladiators.
[22:28.740 --> 22:29.860]  Uh, hanging by a thread.
[22:31.660 --> 22:33.160]  Aiming the rocket pistol.
[22:33.740 --> 22:34.160]  Whoa.
[22:34.580 --> 22:35.920]  Gemini the victor.
[22:36.000 --> 22:36.320]  Yeah!
[22:36.360 --> 22:39.320]  I was a Gemini, so I always felt, like, a special connection.
[22:39.600 --> 22:42.340]  Look at how fucking big his arms are.
[22:42.360 --> 22:42.980]  He's a big fucking dude.
[22:42.980 --> 22:44.120]  That is outrageous.
[22:44.320 --> 22:45.500]  We need to watch that documentary.
[22:45.720 --> 22:45.980]  Oh, my God.
[22:45.980 --> 22:46.960]  That looks like you.
[22:47.440 --> 22:48.580]  Geoff's been working out.
[22:48.720 --> 22:49.420]  Look at that.
[22:49.520 --> 22:49.980]  Oh, I know.
[22:50.280 --> 22:51.180]  Me and Gemini.
[22:51.900 --> 22:52.800]  Uh, there's a maze.
[22:54.360 --> 22:55.060]  There it is.
[22:55.080 --> 22:55.300]  Wow.
[22:55.440 --> 22:56.480]  Ice hangs tough.
[22:56.860 --> 22:57.400]  Oh, that's cool.
[22:58.160 --> 22:58.560]  Whoa!
[23:01.100 --> 23:01.900]  Hanging tough.
[23:02.000 --> 23:02.400]  Cool, man.
[23:02.780 --> 23:03.680]  This is that new kids on the block, right?
[23:03.760 --> 23:04.180]  Yeah, it was.
[23:04.340 --> 23:05.700]  Uh, nitro glistening.
[23:05.960 --> 23:08.480]  Oh, his tits are glistening.
[23:09.280 --> 23:09.840]  That's good.
[23:09.880 --> 23:10.680]  Let's leave that.
[23:11.000 --> 23:11.320]  Wow.
[23:11.600 --> 23:12.340]  That's fucking clever.
[23:12.420 --> 23:14.900]  Does that count as, like, food for, like, hot dogs?
[23:14.920 --> 23:15.180]  Man.
[23:15.520 --> 23:17.540]  Dude, Gemini should have done wrestling.
[23:17.980 --> 23:18.220]  Yeah.
[23:18.540 --> 23:20.480]  I think any of these guys probably could have done wrestling.
[23:20.700 --> 23:21.220]  Hand bike.
[23:21.360 --> 23:21.540]  Yep.
[23:21.840 --> 23:22.540]  Hand bike!
[23:23.140 --> 23:24.520]  That's some American Ninja Warrior shit.
[23:24.860 --> 23:25.760]  I guess all of it was, right?
[23:27.800 --> 23:28.760]  That's glistening.
[23:29.220 --> 23:30.960]  Well, she keeps looking at nitro glistening.
[23:31.360 --> 23:32.960]  It's, like, fucked up.
[23:34.200 --> 23:36.160]  His tits look better than mine.
[23:36.920 --> 23:37.400]  God.
[23:38.280 --> 23:38.780]  Let me see.
[23:40.080 --> 23:40.460]  It's close.
[23:40.800 --> 23:41.800]  Mm, neck and neck.
[23:42.520 --> 23:44.640]  I need to get some shimmer.
[23:44.900 --> 23:45.340]  Glisten up.
[23:45.440 --> 23:46.520]  Glenn Snowden.
[23:46.940 --> 23:49.900]  Oh, when you said football cards, this isn't what I thought they were.
[23:50.340 --> 23:51.280]  Kevin Campbell.
[23:51.400 --> 23:52.060]  What a bummer.
[23:52.400 --> 23:53.480]  Jimmy Case.
[23:54.400 --> 23:57.380]  91 football cards, and I thought we were going to be talking about nature on memes.
[23:57.560 --> 23:58.640]  These are all step-dads.
[23:58.840 --> 24:00.280]  Yeah, we're all just talking about step-dads.
[24:00.300 --> 24:01.060]  Paul Parker.
[24:01.500 --> 24:02.020]  You know these dudes.
[24:02.140 --> 24:03.160]  It's a hard living, too.
[24:03.640 --> 24:04.280]  Kevin Bond.
[24:04.380 --> 24:05.260]  None of them look like this anymore.
[24:05.880 --> 24:06.460]  Tony Adams.
[24:06.720 --> 24:11.040]  This is the thing where it's, like, Larry Bond would talk about eating hot dogs, like, before the game or whatever.
[24:11.200 --> 24:11.360]  Yeah.
[24:11.440 --> 24:12.400]  These guys were eating hot dogs.
[24:12.440 --> 24:12.940]  Let me get that hat.
[24:13.960 --> 24:14.880]  They were drinking beer.
[24:14.880 --> 24:15.720]  Let me get a time-out hot dog.
[24:15.820 --> 24:15.960]  Yeah.
[24:17.100 --> 24:17.460]  Dennis Wise.
[24:17.680 --> 24:18.860]  Can you eat jalapenos on that?
[24:21.420 --> 24:22.060]  Trevor Hebbard.
[24:22.080 --> 24:23.020]  All right, there we go.
[24:23.020 --> 24:23.940]  Some of those.
[24:24.060 --> 24:24.520]  That was cool.
[24:25.320 --> 24:26.840]  Let's fuck with...
[24:26.840 --> 24:27.560]  You know what?
[24:27.660 --> 24:28.880]  It's football season.
[24:29.100 --> 24:29.220]  Yeah.
[24:29.280 --> 24:30.740]  We're about to go into a super...
[24:30.740 --> 24:31.380]  Football's over.
[24:31.780 --> 24:32.000]  Yeah.
[24:32.120 --> 24:32.640]  Football's over.
[24:33.900 --> 24:36.440]  I have some ideas about football.
[24:36.640 --> 24:37.300]  What do you have?
[24:37.520 --> 24:38.240]  Plays to improve it.
[24:38.320 --> 24:39.520]  We'll see in the next couple weeks.
[24:39.940 --> 24:40.800]  Do you want to see...
[24:40.800 --> 24:46.080]  Do you think that the Lions should have played in the second half the way they played in the first half?
[24:47.240 --> 24:48.780]  I think they should have played in the second half.
[24:48.780 --> 24:49.180]  Next year.
[24:49.320 --> 24:49.920]  Next year.
[24:50.180 --> 24:52.020]  Let's see if we can get a...
[24:52.020 --> 24:52.380]  The Lions.
[24:52.700 --> 24:55.420]  Let's see if we can get a real Travis Kelce card.
[24:55.480 --> 24:56.140]  Feed the pack sack.
[24:56.800 --> 24:57.260]  Feed it.
[24:57.300 --> 24:57.840]  Feed the pack sack.
[24:57.860 --> 24:58.320]  He's hungry.
[24:58.440 --> 24:58.820]  He dates...
[24:59.280 --> 25:00.880]  He's dating Taylor Swift.
[25:01.040 --> 25:03.460]  I was listening to Bill Simmons today, and he was saying...
[25:03.460 --> 25:11.540]  They were saying, wouldn't it be cool if, at the Super Bowl, after Travis Kelce scores, or if they win, he pulls a diamond ring, like, out of his shoe, and then he proposes to...
[25:11.540 --> 25:12.080]  That would be...
[25:12.080 --> 25:14.520]  He would catch a touchdown with a diamond ring in his shoe?
[25:14.640 --> 25:14.920]  Yeah.
[25:15.680 --> 25:15.880]  Yeah.
[25:15.960 --> 25:16.360]  I saw...
[25:16.360 --> 25:18.020]  That seems like it would be detrimental in the Super Bowl.
[25:18.260 --> 25:21.100]  There's a lot of stuff, and your wife would know more about this...
[25:21.100 --> 25:23.420]  I like how, like, the number 13 is her favorite number.
[25:23.960 --> 25:25.180]  I think that the...
[25:25.180 --> 25:28.100]  If you add up the Super Bowl numbers, it's 13...
[25:28.680 --> 25:30.080]  There's a bunch of different, like, 13...
[25:30.080 --> 25:32.180]  And it's the 13th game that she's gone to.
[25:33.300 --> 25:33.740]  And...
[25:34.960 --> 25:36.600]  A bunch of other 13s.
[25:36.620 --> 25:39.140]  And Abraham Lincoln and JFK were the same person.
[25:39.280 --> 25:39.540]  Yeah.
[25:39.940 --> 25:40.380]  Yes.
[25:40.620 --> 25:45.940]  I just told her I think it's cool if they win, and then on the field is Taylor Swift.
[25:46.060 --> 25:47.700]  I think that would just be nice.
[25:48.100 --> 25:49.020]  She's just down there?
[25:49.020 --> 25:52.540]  Yeah, she's just, like, you know, supporting Travis Kelce winning the Super Bowl.
[25:52.680 --> 25:53.220]  That'd be really cool.
[25:53.480 --> 25:56.220]  And then she could be in a chunky soup commercial.
[25:56.660 --> 26:01.260]  Does your wife watch Chiefs games to see Taylor Swift?
[26:01.740 --> 26:04.540]  I don't think it's necessarily because of, or...
[26:04.540 --> 26:07.720]  Like, it's definitely Taylor Swift-influenced, but it's not like she's seeking them out.
[26:07.820 --> 26:08.720]  Jalen Rager...
[26:08.720 --> 26:11.040]  She looks up from her Kindle while you're watching it.
[26:11.140 --> 26:11.580]  Yes, 100%.
[26:11.580 --> 26:13.540]  And then she'll ask me, what's the pocket?
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  Or what is a touchback?
[26:16.200 --> 26:18.260]  Why aren't they stopping the clock?
[26:18.260 --> 26:22.600]  Helping me with that, where it was like, okay, now they have to do something this time or else it's nothing.
[26:23.320 --> 26:28.040]  I told her, she said, why is the clock management so poor going into this quarter
[26:28.580 --> 26:30.500]  when it's clear that they have three touchdowns?
[26:30.520 --> 26:35.440]  Why did they use a timeout here to stop the clock at this point?
[26:35.580 --> 26:36.380]  Why did they run?
[26:36.700 --> 26:37.500]  This doesn't make any sense.
[26:37.560 --> 26:38.900]  And I said, that's great analysis.
[26:39.320 --> 26:40.240]  Yeah, and she was right.
[26:42.320 --> 26:43.040]  Nick Chubb...
[26:44.940 --> 26:45.980]  Dayo Odingo...
[26:45.980 --> 26:51.260]  No Kelsey yet.
[26:51.660 --> 26:52.260]  Not yet.
[26:52.420 --> 26:52.900]  Any Lions?
[26:53.340 --> 26:55.220]  Honestly, he'll even take a Jason Kelsey.
[26:55.460 --> 26:56.500]  I will take a Jason Kelsey.
[26:56.640 --> 26:57.060]  He parties.
[26:57.620 --> 26:58.360]  Byron Jones...
[26:58.360 --> 26:59.080]  Yeah, he does.
[26:59.200 --> 27:00.280]  Roquan Smith, got game.
[27:00.340 --> 27:00.980]  That's a cool card.
[27:03.600 --> 27:05.520]  Travis Etienne Jr., rookie.
[27:05.720 --> 27:06.520]  He's a very good player.
[27:07.380 --> 27:09.680]  Eric Stokes, base rookie.
[27:10.080 --> 27:12.700]  Supposedly, Taylor has to fly from Tokyo.
[27:12.700 --> 27:14.200]  She has a show on the 10th.
[27:14.220 --> 27:14.920]  I heard she's going to make it there.
[27:14.980 --> 27:18.280]  And then she is going to fly directly to Vegas.
[27:18.460 --> 27:19.900]  Yeah, I think she'll probably make it.
[27:20.200 --> 27:20.580]  She will.
[27:20.800 --> 27:22.440]  Kyle Pitt, silver.
[27:23.300 --> 27:24.020]  Prism, rookie.
[27:24.160 --> 27:24.520]  That's nice.
[27:24.640 --> 27:25.360]  That's probably the best card I've got so far.
[27:25.360 --> 27:27.000]  Love lifts us up where we belong.
[27:27.040 --> 27:27.660]  Let's leave that.
[27:28.760 --> 27:29.560]  Daniel Sorensen...
[27:29.560 --> 27:30.220]  Love is Red.
[27:30.300 --> 27:31.600]  Xavier Collins...
[27:31.600 --> 27:32.320]  I think that's the song.
[27:32.580 --> 27:33.520]  Karma is something.
[27:33.840 --> 27:34.580]  Karma is a cat.
[27:35.240 --> 27:38.400]  But Karma is the player on the Chiefs.
[27:38.820 --> 27:39.820]  Isn't that what she said?
[27:39.940 --> 27:40.120]  Huh?
[27:40.120 --> 27:43.040]  Everything I know about Taylor Swift, I get through your wife.
[27:44.300 --> 27:45.220]  Ask her tonight.
[27:45.440 --> 27:45.580]  Yeah.
[27:46.060 --> 27:51.720]  Ed Oliver, Devin White, Ucam Akers, and then Christian McCaffrey.
[27:52.160 --> 27:54.060]  He plays for the bad guys.
[27:55.400 --> 27:56.200]  Not a not, though.
[27:56.520 --> 27:56.900]  He...
[27:56.900 --> 27:58.700]  Yeah, he plays for the 49ers.
[27:58.760 --> 27:59.180]  He...
[27:59.180 --> 27:59.560]  Had a good day.
[27:59.720 --> 28:01.400]  He was running people...
[28:01.400 --> 28:03.300]  It was like the Lions forgot how to tackle.
[28:03.500 --> 28:09.320]  I don't know what it is about wrapping someone up and taking them down that they forgot how to do.
[28:09.320 --> 28:11.280]  But boy, they forgot how to do it.
[28:11.360 --> 28:12.120]  They forgot how to do it hard.
[28:12.200 --> 28:13.300]  Holy shit.
[28:13.300 --> 28:15.800]  Oh, shit.
[28:16.180 --> 28:16.900]  Oh, we got...
[28:16.900 --> 28:17.760]  Silver Boy.
[28:18.260 --> 28:21.140]  Oh, shit.
[28:21.320 --> 28:22.100]  Javonte Williams.
[28:22.160 --> 28:22.320]  Cool.
[28:22.420 --> 28:24.340]  Blue Wave rookie or whatever it's called.
[28:25.540 --> 28:27.640]  Oh, shit.
[28:27.760 --> 28:28.620]  Trey Lance rookie.
[28:28.620 --> 28:29.060]  Bass rookie.
[28:29.380 --> 28:30.340]  Oh, shit.
[28:30.760 --> 28:32.080]  Bass Travis Kelsey.
[28:34.760 --> 28:35.980]  We got it.
[28:36.420 --> 28:36.760]  Cool.
[28:37.480 --> 28:38.280]  That's fine.
[28:38.280 --> 28:40.280]  I wonder what these rookie cards go for.
[28:40.400 --> 28:44.380]  Do you think that next year his cards will say, like, dating Taylor Swift?
[28:44.800 --> 28:46.220]  I'm sure that's what they'll say.
[28:46.940 --> 28:49.320]  Anna Campbell's chunky suit commercial with his mom.
[28:49.460 --> 28:50.200]  Last year.
[28:51.080 --> 28:51.520]  Plexico.
[28:51.700 --> 28:52.340]  Touchdown Masters.
[28:52.860 --> 28:55.900]  Dude, why'd you just gloss over Plexico Burruss?
[28:55.980 --> 28:56.580]  This is 2018.
[28:56.740 --> 29:01.860]  He's my favorite guy that shot himself in his own leg wearing sweatpants to a strip club and having a gun inside his mouth.
[29:01.860 --> 29:04.280]  Should we have a shot themselves team?
[29:05.060 --> 29:05.380]  100%.
[29:05.380 --> 29:06.460]  Yeah, let's put Plexico in there.
[29:07.240 --> 29:08.100]  Oh, Tee Higgins.
[29:09.220 --> 29:11.580]  How do you wear sweatpants?
[29:11.960 --> 29:15.320]  How do you wear sweatpants with a gun to a strip club?
[29:15.500 --> 29:18.020]  How else are they going to peep his big dong if you're not wearing gray sweatpants?
[29:18.280 --> 29:19.060]  Wow, that's a big dong.
[29:19.220 --> 29:20.400]  No, it's a gun.
[29:20.540 --> 29:20.980]  It's a...
[29:20.980 --> 29:22.020]  Let me show you.
[29:22.100 --> 29:22.340]  Ow.
[29:22.980 --> 29:25.000]  Eric, you were very excited about these.
[29:25.080 --> 29:25.620]  These just came out.
[29:25.680 --> 29:26.900]  You requested that we buy them.
[29:26.920 --> 29:29.440]  I just wanted to buy one pack and you're like, give me four.
[29:29.540 --> 29:30.280]  I got four boxes.
[29:31.340 --> 29:34.260]  So these are AEW 2023.
[29:35.420 --> 29:36.400]  Are they upper deck?
[29:36.740 --> 29:36.920]  Yeah.
[29:38.100 --> 29:39.140]  I haven't seen these.
[29:39.240 --> 29:42.980]  I'm very curious to see what's inside and what the chase is, etc.
[29:43.220 --> 29:45.360]  I do not like the way their blaster box works.
[29:45.520 --> 29:46.260]  Yeah, me neither.
[29:47.020 --> 29:48.620]  I'll put a pack sack in.
[29:48.900 --> 29:52.960]  How do you feel about Vince McMahon being a really cool guy?
[29:53.100 --> 29:56.020]  If anyone didn't see that coming, it's like they weren't paying attention.
[29:56.420 --> 29:58.760]  It really, like, of course.
[29:58.960 --> 30:01.380]  I think I was more surprised that people were surprised.
[30:01.520 --> 30:01.940]  Yeah, me too.
[30:02.460 --> 30:02.600]  Yeah.
[30:02.800 --> 30:03.260]  But you're like, yeah.
[30:03.320 --> 30:04.180]  Long time coming.
[30:05.580 --> 30:06.340]  Lock them up.
[30:06.720 --> 30:07.340]  Throw away the key.
[30:07.340 --> 30:08.080]  Fine with that.
[30:08.280 --> 30:09.960]  But what do we got in these AEW cards?
[30:10.400 --> 30:10.980]  Hit me with it.
[30:11.000 --> 30:11.720]  Not Vince McMahon.
[30:13.820 --> 30:14.620]  Chris Statlander.
[30:14.940 --> 30:15.860]  She's from Long Island.
[30:16.580 --> 30:19.040]  She's got those jeans with holes in them that I don't get.
[30:19.180 --> 30:19.700]  Yeah, she tough.
[30:20.020 --> 30:20.940]  Oh, that's what it is.
[30:21.360 --> 30:23.200]  How about Dante Martin?
[30:23.480 --> 30:24.040]  Dante Martin.
[30:24.300 --> 30:25.420]  One half of Top Flight.
[30:26.180 --> 30:26.780]  Was he in the military?
[30:27.120 --> 30:27.460]  No.
[30:28.360 --> 30:30.520]  He jumps over the top rope a lot.
[30:31.580 --> 30:33.000]  He does some crazy shit.
[30:33.100 --> 30:33.520]  It's pretty cool.
[30:33.580 --> 30:36.080]  Is there a team called Medium Flight and they jump through the ropes?
[30:36.480 --> 30:36.860]  No.
[30:38.060 --> 30:40.420]  There's two guys who are ex-military and they salute.
[30:40.580 --> 30:41.040]  That's pretty good.
[30:41.140 --> 30:41.540]  Well, that's nice.
[30:41.640 --> 30:41.760]  Yeah.
[30:42.420 --> 30:43.640]  What about Saraya?
[30:43.980 --> 30:44.220]  Yeah.
[30:45.360 --> 30:47.980]  She used to be Paige in WWE.
[30:48.340 --> 30:48.900]  She looks like Daria.
[30:49.220 --> 30:50.380]  She does kind of look like Daria.
[30:50.420 --> 30:51.200]  She's very gothy.
[30:52.220 --> 30:53.140]  Yeah, she's very gothy.
[30:53.360 --> 30:54.000]  What about this one?
[30:54.580 --> 30:55.320]  Julia Hart.
[30:55.700 --> 30:56.320]  Talk about goth.
[30:56.320 --> 30:56.940]  Look at that hat.
[30:57.100 --> 30:58.220]  It's like the Undertaker's hat.
[30:58.400 --> 30:58.540]  City witch.
[30:58.700 --> 31:01.620]  It's like she's coming to Austin, Texas for South by Southwest.
[31:01.860 --> 31:02.230]  In 2016.
[31:05.710 --> 31:07.410]  She's shopping for antiques at Round Top.
[31:08.570 --> 31:09.950]  That's a very local reference.
[31:11.110 --> 31:11.910]  Kenny Omega.
[31:12.450 --> 31:13.450]  That's the man.
[31:13.610 --> 31:15.110]  He's out with injury right now.
[31:16.030 --> 31:16.430]  Diverticulitis.
[31:16.790 --> 31:17.710]  I know that game.
[31:18.050 --> 31:18.710]  That's rough.
[31:19.090 --> 31:22.290]  He was supposed to have a pay-per-view match and he came out and cut a promo and everyone went,
[31:22.530 --> 31:24.070]  man, he looked pretty rough.
[31:24.270 --> 31:26.230]  And then a day later, it's him in a hospital bed going,
[31:26.550 --> 31:28.350]  hey guys, gonna miss the pay-per-view this Sunday.
[31:28.770 --> 31:29.710]  And it's like, oh, fuck.
[31:29.730 --> 31:31.050]  He needs to drink Miralax every night.
[31:31.050 --> 31:32.810]  Probably has to for the rest of his life.
[31:32.890 --> 31:33.430]  I know that game.
[31:33.930 --> 31:34.370]  Tag team.
[31:34.390 --> 31:34.910]  Tag teams.
[31:35.110 --> 31:36.170]  It's the Lucha Bros.
[31:36.370 --> 31:37.130]  The Lucha Brothers.
[31:40.130 --> 31:41.210]  Penta and Phoenix.
[31:41.390 --> 31:41.970]  These guys are great.
[31:42.110 --> 31:42.890]  Great luchadors.
[31:43.230 --> 31:45.250]  How do you feel about Alex Reynolds?
[31:46.030 --> 31:46.590]  He's great.
[31:46.750 --> 31:48.030]  He's part of the Dark Order.
[31:48.930 --> 31:51.490]  I don't think he should have a beard, but that's just me personally.
[31:52.170 --> 31:52.770]  I gotta be honest with you.
[31:52.790 --> 31:54.390]  That jacket and those pants do not go.
[31:54.610 --> 31:55.310]  No, no, no.
[31:55.310 --> 31:59.170]  But that's during an entrance where he was with a team with like a cowboy.
[31:59.170 --> 32:03.370]  So he was kind of like meeting in the middle.
[32:03.750 --> 32:05.810]  Like his gear with the cowboy guy.
[32:06.090 --> 32:06.710]  It was a very cool entrance.
[32:06.770 --> 32:07.610]  He was the Brooks and Dunn.
[32:07.750 --> 32:08.530]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:08.570 --> 32:12.510]  Here's some sort of mat art card, upper deck canvas card.
[32:12.530 --> 32:14.010]  That's cool, with Pac on it.
[32:14.230 --> 32:14.410]  Yeah.
[32:15.070 --> 32:15.570]  Who's Pac?
[32:15.710 --> 32:19.170]  Pac is from Newcastle upon Tyne, I think.
[32:19.470 --> 32:21.430]  And he is very British.
[32:21.830 --> 32:23.030]  Or Welsh, I guess.
[32:23.570 --> 32:26.590]  And he's fucking jacked to the gills.
[32:26.590 --> 32:30.050]  And when he, his finishing move is called the Black Arrow.
[32:30.390 --> 32:35.530]  He does a gainer off the top rope, but he also does like a full corkscrew rotation with it.
[32:36.690 --> 32:39.850]  It's a forward moving backflip with a full spin rotation.
[32:39.990 --> 32:40.650]  It's fucking wild.
[32:40.770 --> 32:42.070]  Is he the only one that does that?
[32:42.230 --> 32:44.630]  No, I've seen other people do it, but he's the first one I've ever seen do it.
[32:44.750 --> 32:45.830]  Sounds very Greg Louganis.
[32:46.070 --> 32:47.470]  Yes, he's very athletic.
[32:47.990 --> 32:48.710]  What we got?
[32:49.070 --> 32:49.910]  Chris Jericho.
[32:50.050 --> 32:51.610]  Oh yeah, that's Chris Jericho.
[32:51.830 --> 32:52.510]  He's been around forever.
[32:52.810 --> 32:53.450]  Classic Chris Jericho.
[32:53.490 --> 32:54.290]  Does he still do it?
[32:54.490 --> 32:55.770]  Yeah, no, he's still going.
[32:56.330 --> 32:58.170]  Nick Jackson, one half of the Young Bucks.
[32:58.170 --> 32:58.510]  Wow.
[32:58.530 --> 33:00.030]  One of the guys who started the company.
[33:00.290 --> 33:00.770]  Party animal.
[33:00.910 --> 33:01.910]  Yep, yep, yep.
[33:01.930 --> 33:03.810]  Yeah, he looks like he's in that...
[33:03.810 --> 33:04.350]  Party Animals?
[33:04.530 --> 33:04.730]  Yeah.
[33:05.070 --> 33:11.030]  Oh, I mean, it's definitely the gear, the flashy gear designed to catch the eye and make everyone go,
[33:11.130 --> 33:12.290]  Oh fuck, it's working.
[33:12.570 --> 33:12.750]  Yeah.
[33:12.970 --> 33:15.970]  Would you ever do wrestling?
[33:16.590 --> 33:17.970]  I mean, I do commentary.
[33:18.550 --> 33:18.850]  I know, but...
[33:18.850 --> 33:21.530]  But actually, taking the bumps fucking sucks.
[33:21.590 --> 33:21.790]  Yeah.
[33:21.850 --> 33:22.790]  It hurts so bad.
[33:23.270 --> 33:24.210]  There's Fitter.
[33:24.210 --> 33:25.610]  F-T-R.
[33:25.770 --> 33:26.630]  Great tag team.
[33:27.230 --> 33:28.130]  What's F-T-R stand for?
[33:28.270 --> 33:29.330]  Fuck the Revival.
[33:29.490 --> 33:30.970]  Their old tag team name was the Revival.
[33:31.290 --> 33:31.890]  And then they left.
[33:32.390 --> 33:34.230]  How do you feel about Excalibur?
[33:35.010 --> 33:35.170]  Oh!
[33:35.170 --> 33:36.250]  It's not just a sword anymore.
[33:36.550 --> 33:39.310]  I saw this guy wrestle in 2004.
[33:40.370 --> 33:42.210]  He started a company called Pro Wrestling Gorilla.
[33:42.270 --> 33:44.690]  Now he's the lead commentator for AEW.
[33:44.790 --> 33:45.470]  He doesn't wrestle anymore.
[33:45.590 --> 33:46.670]  And I think he lives in San Diego.
[33:47.050 --> 33:47.450]  Hey!
[33:47.930 --> 33:48.330]  Awesome.
[33:48.470 --> 33:49.490]  Is it you under that mask?
[33:49.490 --> 33:50.250]  It's not.
[33:50.630 --> 33:51.250]  It's not.
[33:51.390 --> 33:52.930]  Have you ever been in the same place at the same time?
[33:53.170 --> 33:53.570]  Yes.
[33:53.570 --> 33:54.550]  I just said I watched him wrestle.
[33:54.570 --> 33:55.270]  I've never seen it.
[33:55.370 --> 33:55.570]  Yeah.
[33:55.730 --> 33:56.630]  Brian Danielson.
[33:56.710 --> 33:57.610]  Where's the proof?
[33:57.890 --> 33:58.270]  Panties.
[33:58.590 --> 33:58.790]  Oh!
[34:00.490 --> 34:01.690]  How about Jim Ross?
[34:01.710 --> 34:01.910]  Oh!
[34:02.130 --> 34:02.710]  The Hall of Famer.
[34:02.850 --> 34:03.410]  Still wrestling.
[34:03.450 --> 34:04.650]  He is a...
[34:05.310 --> 34:06.710]  He's a commentator.
[34:06.970 --> 34:09.130]  His whole thing is that he's an Oklahoma guy.
[34:09.530 --> 34:14.390]  And when he comes out and he's in Austin, he comes out to the Boomer Sooner song.
[34:14.790 --> 34:15.850]  And he puts up the horns.
[34:16.070 --> 34:17.150]  And then he puts down the horns.
[34:17.330 --> 34:18.290]  And everybody goes, yeah!
[34:18.670 --> 34:19.070]  Boom!
[34:19.410 --> 34:19.830]  It's great.
[34:20.070 --> 34:20.230]  See?
[34:20.490 --> 34:21.010]  Gracie hates it.
[34:21.010 --> 34:23.010]  This is a fucking very cool card.
[34:23.870 --> 34:25.030]  It's Chris Statlander.
[34:25.110 --> 34:25.590]  Oh, nice!
[34:25.770 --> 34:26.770]  But it's like a...
[34:26.770 --> 34:27.570]  Oh, wow!
[34:27.810 --> 34:28.770]  It's like a see-through sell card.
[34:28.890 --> 34:29.630]  But it's also...
[34:29.630 --> 34:31.310]  I don't know if you can tell, but it's raised.
[34:31.350 --> 34:31.890]  Oh, neat!
[34:31.930 --> 34:32.890]  I've never seen a card like this before.
[34:32.890 --> 34:33.730]  Like a puzzle piece.
[34:33.910 --> 34:34.050]  Yeah.
[34:34.150 --> 34:34.990]  Really neat.
[34:35.270 --> 34:35.710]  Yes, of course.
[34:35.710 --> 34:37.030]  Do you know who Chris Stat...
[34:37.030 --> 34:37.750]  Who was that again?
[34:37.770 --> 34:39.330]  Yeah, Chris Statlander was the first card that we opened.
[34:39.450 --> 34:40.310]  She's a...
[34:40.310 --> 34:41.590]  She's a great, great wrestler.
[34:41.790 --> 34:42.250]  She's fantastic.
[34:42.390 --> 34:44.930]  Former TBS champion.
[34:45.170 --> 34:46.890]  That's probably the coolest card I've seen.
[34:47.110 --> 34:48.830]  Turner Broadcast Station champion?
[34:48.950 --> 34:50.190]  They're on TBS and TNT.
[34:50.190 --> 34:51.610]  Yeah, it's definitely up there, isn't it?
[34:51.650 --> 34:52.310]  It's a really cool card.
[34:52.450 --> 34:53.030]  I've never seen one like that.
[34:53.030 --> 34:53.670]  Way to go, AEW.
[34:53.730 --> 34:54.310]  You figured it out.
[34:54.590 --> 34:54.870]  It's nice.
[34:55.170 --> 34:55.570]  Very pretty.
[34:56.150 --> 34:56.790]  Very pretty.
[34:58.370 --> 35:00.990]  Oh, here's Ruby Soho.
[35:01.230 --> 35:01.570]  Oh, yeah.
[35:01.590 --> 35:03.970]  So this is like a punk rock kind of thing.
[35:03.990 --> 35:05.970]  Oh, and could you guess what her theme song is?
[35:06.230 --> 35:07.850]  I'm going to guess it's a Rancid song.
[35:08.030 --> 35:09.730]  I can't place the song.
[35:09.850 --> 35:13.530]  Went to the pay-per-view and when she came out and had a match,
[35:14.350 --> 35:15.270]  they dropped a curtain.
[35:15.370 --> 35:16.930]  They said, ladies and gentlemen, Rancid.
[35:17.070 --> 35:19.030]  And then they played Ruby Soho.
[35:19.030 --> 35:20.030]  Rancid played?
[35:20.230 --> 35:21.470]  It was fucking crazy.
[35:21.810 --> 35:22.110]  Wow.
[35:22.230 --> 35:24.050]  It was like, what?
[35:24.890 --> 35:26.630]  And so now I've seen Rancid.
[35:28.530 --> 35:29.590]  That is wild.
[35:31.330 --> 35:32.470]  Referee Rick Knox.
[35:32.790 --> 35:33.950]  That looks like Billy Corgan.
[35:34.390 --> 35:36.210]  It does kind of look like Billy Corgan.
[35:38.030 --> 35:42.010]  Fade Cargill with what may be the most powerful looking legs I've ever seen.
[35:42.070 --> 35:43.090]  Her name is Jade Cargill.
[35:43.330 --> 35:47.030]  She just went over to WWE and she debuted, I guess,
[35:47.030 --> 35:48.850]  technically last night at the Royal Rumble.
[35:49.610 --> 35:53.550]  Ooh, how about Sammy Guevara and Tai Mello?
[35:54.250 --> 35:55.130]  Tai Mello, yeah.
[35:55.330 --> 35:56.270]  All in the family.
[35:56.390 --> 35:57.050]  They are married.
[35:57.590 --> 35:57.990]  Oh.
[35:58.530 --> 36:00.070]  They met at AEW and they got married.
[36:00.550 --> 36:01.710]  Sammy Guevara.
[36:02.030 --> 36:07.270]  He wrestled here a lot in Austin at AAPW where I do commentary.
[36:07.610 --> 36:08.670]  Oh, it's a gold parallel.
[36:08.870 --> 36:09.530]  Let's leave this.
[36:09.630 --> 36:09.770]  Neat.
[36:09.990 --> 36:12.170]  Do you think it's a happy marriage?
[36:12.710 --> 36:13.770]  They just had a kid, so probably.
[36:13.830 --> 36:14.190]  Oh, good for them.
[36:14.190 --> 36:15.330]  That's what happens, right?
[36:15.770 --> 36:17.930]  He's wearing her on his shirt.
[36:18.290 --> 36:19.070]  He's supporting.
[36:19.350 --> 36:19.790]  That's really great.
[36:19.850 --> 36:22.170]  Like how you support me with Clutch My Pearls podcast.
[36:23.070 --> 36:24.310]  Listen to it.
[36:27.810 --> 36:29.250]  That's so dominant of you.
[36:29.310 --> 36:29.890]  I love it.
[36:29.970 --> 36:33.210]  Hey, listen to it or I'll set a gas station on fire.
[36:33.370 --> 36:34.190]  No, no, no, no, no.
[36:34.250 --> 36:37.310]  If they don't listen to it, then you'll set the gas station on fire.
[36:37.930 --> 36:39.510]  But it'll be your gas station.
[36:39.550 --> 36:42.250]  And if you don't own a gas station, I'll make you buy one first.
[36:42.250 --> 36:44.970]  And then if they do listen to it, will you tell them that they're good girls?
[36:45.510 --> 36:46.610]  Be a good girl.
[36:50.710 --> 36:51.510]  Ray Phoenix.
[36:52.110 --> 36:53.810]  Yeah, let's get back to the pool wrestling.
[36:55.630 --> 36:57.010]  Let's get back to the dudes on dudes.
[36:57.550 --> 37:00.490]  It's a diamond plate parallel, I guess.
[37:00.590 --> 37:02.530]  Ray Phoenix is a phenomenal professional wrestler.
[37:02.730 --> 37:03.170]  He is great.
[37:05.650 --> 37:06.450]  Taya Valkyrie.
[37:08.230 --> 37:09.030]  Taya Valkyrie.
[37:09.250 --> 37:09.910]  Wear a loca.
[37:10.190 --> 37:10.650]  I like it.
[37:11.250 --> 37:11.610]  What?
[37:11.610 --> 37:15.230]  She wrestled in Mexico a lot and they called her Wera Loca.
[37:16.090 --> 37:17.510]  The crazy white girl.
[37:19.210 --> 37:20.170]  Komosuke Takeshita?
[37:20.410 --> 37:21.270]  Yeah, Takeshita.
[37:21.530 --> 37:21.950]  Takeshita.
[37:22.550 --> 37:27.370]  He is so fucking big and so fucking strong and so fast.
[37:27.410 --> 37:28.270]  It's crazy.
[37:28.550 --> 37:29.630]  Here's another all in the family.
[37:29.910 --> 37:31.590]  Oh, it's Taz, brother.
[37:31.870 --> 37:32.430]  Look at Taz.
[37:32.470 --> 37:34.410]  You can see his little wiener right there.
[37:34.410 --> 37:35.070]  You can't.
[37:35.310 --> 37:35.810]  So Taz...
[37:35.810 --> 37:36.570]  You can see his little peepee.
[37:36.730 --> 37:38.850]  In the 90s, Taz was a pro wrestler.
[37:38.850 --> 37:39.690]  Now he's a commentator.
[37:39.790 --> 37:42.170]  And his son, Hook, is a wrestler in AEW now.
[37:42.410 --> 37:43.350]  And it's great.
[37:43.450 --> 37:44.990]  Actually, he wrestled with Action Bronson.
[37:45.350 --> 37:45.810]  Did he really?
[37:45.910 --> 37:46.910]  Yeah, they were on a tag team.
[37:46.910 --> 37:47.290]  Oh, that's awesome.
[37:47.310 --> 37:47.750]  It's really cool.
[37:50.430 --> 37:51.230]  Brody King.
[37:51.810 --> 37:52.270]  Oh, yeah.
[37:52.350 --> 37:52.650]  Hell yeah.
[37:52.770 --> 37:54.090]  That's a...
[37:54.090 --> 37:57.250]  He's very, very, very goth.
[37:57.330 --> 37:58.130]  Very fucking...
[37:58.130 --> 37:59.510]  You can't see there.
[37:59.730 --> 38:00.290]  All tattoos.
[38:00.670 --> 38:01.850]  All, like, just...
[38:03.270 --> 38:03.670]  Everywhere.
[38:03.830 --> 38:04.690]  Looks kind of like Adam Ellis.
[38:05.150 --> 38:06.490]  He does look like Adam Ellis.
[38:06.490 --> 38:08.670]  He looks like he blow dries his beard straight.
[38:10.750 --> 38:11.450]  That's funny.
[38:11.530 --> 38:12.730]  Austin Gunn.
[38:12.770 --> 38:13.270]  Oh, hell yeah.
[38:13.310 --> 38:14.490]  Billy Gunn's son.
[38:17.470 --> 38:18.570]  Who is his mom?
[38:18.670 --> 38:19.630]  Machine Gunn?
[38:20.970 --> 38:21.690]  This is fun.
[38:21.830 --> 38:23.470]  Tag team's Young Bucks.
[38:23.630 --> 38:24.510]  Yeah, they...
[38:24.510 --> 38:25.190]  Young Bucks.
[38:25.330 --> 38:26.490]  They get up to it, don't they?
[38:26.510 --> 38:28.510]  Gay brother, don't they?
[38:28.590 --> 38:29.790]  They get up to some stuff.
[38:29.890 --> 38:30.850]  We are all elite.
[38:31.190 --> 38:31.670]  MJF.
[38:31.710 --> 38:32.350]  It's MJF.
[38:32.510 --> 38:33.790]  Former world champion.
[38:33.790 --> 38:35.810]  Do you think that's an authentic Burberry scarf?
[38:35.970 --> 38:37.090]  Or he got it, like...
[38:37.090 --> 38:37.950]  Oh, I think...
[38:37.950 --> 38:39.230]  I think when he was on the Indies.
[38:39.330 --> 38:42.830]  When I saw him at the back room of AFS and I watched him wrestle,
[38:43.050 --> 38:44.710]  I don't think that was an authentic Burberry scarf.
[38:45.010 --> 38:46.030]  I think that one might be.
[38:46.390 --> 38:47.350]  Here's a Dazzler.
[38:48.090 --> 38:48.890]  Chris Statlinger.
[38:49.570 --> 38:50.970]  Wow, that's a cool card.
[38:51.110 --> 38:51.310]  Look at that.
[38:52.210 --> 38:53.050]  It's like fireworks.
[38:54.110 --> 38:55.250]  I used to have that there.
[38:56.370 --> 38:57.170]  Anthony Bowens.
[38:57.270 --> 38:57.650]  Nice!
[38:59.650 --> 39:00.450]  Swerve Strickland.
[39:00.570 --> 39:02.050]  That's a cool fucking name.
[39:02.110 --> 39:03.110]  He is...
[39:03.110 --> 39:04.270]  That guy's...
[39:04.670 --> 39:06.350]  Sky's the limit for Swerve Strickland.
[39:06.610 --> 39:06.730]  Really?
[39:06.930 --> 39:08.650]  Yeah, he's gonna be probably world champion this year.
[39:08.930 --> 39:09.250]  Wow.
[39:09.570 --> 39:09.870]  Yeah, yeah.
[39:09.910 --> 39:11.330]  He is so good.
[39:11.410 --> 39:12.810]  And he's been so good for so long.
[39:12.870 --> 39:14.110]  But, man, he just put it all together.
[39:14.330 --> 39:14.890]  It's been really fun.
[39:14.890 --> 39:15.570]  You know what, though?
[39:15.810 --> 39:18.010]  Not if Paul Turner has anything to say about it.
[39:18.030 --> 39:19.270]  Senior referee Paul Turner!
[39:19.670 --> 39:20.430]  Oh, man.
[39:20.650 --> 39:21.190]  Look at him.
[39:21.290 --> 39:22.250]  They made him pose for that.
[39:22.490 --> 39:23.090]  Probably, yeah.
[39:23.310 --> 39:23.670]  Probably...
[39:23.670 --> 39:25.350]  Oh, come on.
[39:25.710 --> 39:26.630]  Give me a little bit.
[39:26.750 --> 39:27.190]  Put your arm...
[39:27.830 --> 39:29.030]  Like, give me...
[39:29.030 --> 39:30.010]  Oh, that's...
[39:30.010 --> 39:30.390]  mean.
[39:30.990 --> 39:32.030]  I know, I know.
[39:32.030 --> 39:33.430]  That's the best one they got.
[39:33.870 --> 39:34.490]  Oh, Paul.
[39:34.890 --> 39:35.330]  Wardlow.
[39:35.530 --> 39:37.170]  Yeah, the warthog!
[39:37.670 --> 39:38.010]  He big.
[39:38.290 --> 39:39.010]  He is.
[39:39.050 --> 39:39.570]  He's very big.
[39:39.830 --> 39:40.190]  Except...
[39:40.190 --> 39:41.370]  Buddy Matthews.
[39:41.450 --> 39:41.810]  Yeah.
[39:42.190 --> 39:43.110]  He's, uh...
[39:43.110 --> 39:43.750]  He looks crazy.
[39:44.030 --> 39:44.190]  His pants are weird, too.
[39:44.190 --> 39:45.190]  He's fucking jacked as hell.
[39:45.270 --> 39:45.770]  Look at his...
[39:45.770 --> 39:46.690]  Look at his abs.
[39:46.890 --> 39:47.730]  He's so big.
[39:48.070 --> 39:49.330]  Now, this is not a...
[39:49.330 --> 39:50.650]  what I would call a flattering photo.
[39:50.810 --> 39:50.890]  Okay.
[39:50.890 --> 39:51.410]  But maybe it is.
[39:51.430 --> 39:52.130]  You might know him better.
[39:52.530 --> 39:53.530]  Matt Menard.
[39:53.810 --> 39:54.590]  Oh, yeah.
[39:54.810 --> 39:56.470]  His nickname is Daddy Magic.
[39:56.650 --> 39:57.850]  And that's fucking awesome.
[39:58.410 --> 39:58.810]  Ugh.
[39:59.230 --> 40:00.330]  Daddy Magic.
[40:00.330 --> 40:00.470]  Daddy Magic.
[40:02.350 --> 40:03.310]  Matt Menard.
[40:03.430 --> 40:06.570]  That's the creep that shows up to your kid's birthday party to be the magician.
[40:06.690 --> 40:06.910]  What do you mean?
[40:06.990 --> 40:07.850]  You talking about Daddy Magic?
[40:09.310 --> 40:09.790]  Uh...
[40:09.790 --> 40:10.630]  Hikaru Ishida?
[40:11.070 --> 40:11.530]  Oh, yeah.
[40:11.610 --> 40:11.890]  Hell yeah.
[40:12.050 --> 40:12.670]  Hikaru Ishida.
[40:12.890 --> 40:14.470]  Former AEW Women's Champion.
[40:15.110 --> 40:17.330]  How about Nyla Rose?
[40:17.630 --> 40:19.090]  Former AEW Women's Champion.
[40:20.050 --> 40:20.530]  Uh...
[40:20.530 --> 40:23.330]  The Green Pyro, Claudio Castagnoli.
[40:24.110 --> 40:24.430]  Yeah.
[40:24.770 --> 40:25.750]  The most money-making man.
[40:25.750 --> 40:26.710]  That one's numbered.
[40:26.870 --> 40:27.070]  Yeah.
[40:27.330 --> 40:27.810]  349.
[40:27.910 --> 40:28.530]  Ooh, that's cool.
[40:28.530 --> 40:30.050]  Yeah, that's the first numbered card we've got today.
[40:30.270 --> 40:30.770]  Oh, wow.
[40:30.830 --> 40:32.150]  It really comes alive right there.
[40:32.210 --> 40:33.530]  I watched him wrestle.
[40:34.210 --> 40:35.270]  It was probably in 2005.
[40:35.790 --> 40:37.790]  I watched him wrestle a whole match in a headlock.
[40:38.330 --> 40:38.510]  Really?
[40:38.630 --> 40:39.990]  It was like 15 minutes long.
[40:40.430 --> 40:43.390]  And half the crowd fucking hated it.
[40:43.430 --> 40:44.990]  The guy's arm, like, froze up and they couldn't get it out.
[40:44.990 --> 40:46.050]  They were like, just wrestle through.
[40:46.130 --> 40:48.150]  Him and another card that we got earlier, Brian Danielson.
[40:48.270 --> 40:51.190]  They just went, we're gonna go out there and just do a headlock.
[40:51.270 --> 40:51.530]  Okay.
[40:51.630 --> 40:52.610]  And the whole match was in a headlock.
[40:52.670 --> 40:53.250]  It was fucking great.
[40:53.390 --> 40:53.650]  Incredible.
[40:53.910 --> 40:54.570]  There's Powerhouse Hobbs.
[40:54.590 --> 40:55.350]  He's jacked.
[40:55.370 --> 40:56.430]  That guy's so fucking big.
[40:56.430 --> 40:57.150]  It's insane.
[40:57.170 --> 40:58.330]  There's Trent Moreno.
[40:58.430 --> 40:59.250]  Yeah, it's Trent.
[40:59.350 --> 41:00.410]  Does he have a lumberjack?
[41:00.550 --> 41:02.310]  Yeah, in this match, it was a lumberjack match.
[41:02.350 --> 41:03.490]  So he came out like a lumberjack.
[41:04.310 --> 41:05.190]  Big Greg right there.
[41:05.390 --> 41:05.510]  Did he win?
[41:06.190 --> 41:07.110]  No, he was on the outside.
[41:07.230 --> 41:08.050]  He was one of the lumberjacks.
[41:08.230 --> 41:09.010]  Did he chop any wood?
[41:09.210 --> 41:11.050]  No, he came out with an axe handle, though.
[41:11.630 --> 41:11.770]  Oh.
[41:12.050 --> 41:12.190]  Yeah.
[41:12.490 --> 41:13.130]  Just in case.
[41:13.210 --> 41:13.350]  Yeah.
[41:13.570 --> 41:13.990]  An axe handle?
[41:13.990 --> 41:15.350]  He is just like my friend Andrew Douglas.
[41:15.430 --> 41:16.030]  Really something.
[41:16.130 --> 41:16.770]  There's Pac again.
[41:17.090 --> 41:17.190]  Yep.
[41:17.670 --> 41:20.270]  How do you get, like, his chest is so fucking big.
[41:20.510 --> 41:21.470]  What the fuck?
[41:21.650 --> 41:23.630]  His arms, his shoulders are, like, insane.
[41:23.750 --> 41:24.450]  You want me to take my shirt off?
[41:24.850 --> 41:25.650]  It's not hard.
[41:25.650 --> 41:26.890]  Just get a kettlebell.
[41:27.130 --> 41:29.010]  It just takes discipline.
[41:29.250 --> 41:29.650]  Oh, okay.
[41:30.730 --> 41:31.470]  Darby Allen.
[41:31.810 --> 41:32.370]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[41:32.550 --> 41:35.710]  Do they test for worms in the...
[41:35.710 --> 41:36.090]  They do.
[41:36.830 --> 41:37.230]  Really?
[41:37.570 --> 41:37.710]  Yeah.
[41:38.330 --> 41:39.310]  But they don't care.
[41:40.190 --> 41:42.170]  No, they test to make sure you have worms.
[41:42.930 --> 41:43.870]  Everybody's required to have worms.
[41:43.870 --> 41:45.530]  You just asked if they test for it.
[41:45.710 --> 41:46.690]  I'm saying yes, they do.
[41:46.790 --> 41:48.310]  But do they give a shit?
[41:48.650 --> 41:49.750]  All I'm saying is they test for it.
[41:49.930 --> 41:50.990]  Smart Mark Sterling.
[41:51.210 --> 41:52.770]  Oh, he's a lawyer.
[41:52.850 --> 41:53.850]  His character is he's a lawyer.
[41:53.950 --> 41:54.650]  He looks like it.
[41:54.650 --> 41:56.230]  Gold Parallel with Dax Harwood.
[41:56.230 --> 41:57.330]  Dax Harwood from FTR.
[41:57.510 --> 41:59.110]  He looks like a dude you'd have a beer with.
[41:59.230 --> 42:01.750]  Yeah, I think he's from Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina.
[42:02.050 --> 42:02.650]  I think that's great.
[42:02.810 --> 42:04.810]  Oh, here's a playing card for double or nothing.
[42:04.850 --> 42:05.870]  Ricky Starks.
[42:06.170 --> 42:07.130]  He's from...
[42:07.130 --> 42:09.150]  So he trained at AAPW.
[42:09.470 --> 42:10.870]  He's from Austin, Texas.
[42:11.110 --> 42:14.190]  I see him all the time at these shows in Austin now.
[42:14.430 --> 42:14.610]  Really?
[42:14.750 --> 42:15.410]  Yeah, he lives here.
[42:15.710 --> 42:16.850]  And so it's just him.
[42:17.490 --> 42:20.050]  We go and shoot promos and stuff for, like, this wrestling thing.
[42:20.070 --> 42:21.750]  And then he's just at...
[42:21.750 --> 42:23.230]  You should get him to sign the fucking ADA.
[42:23.230 --> 42:23.470]  Yeah.
[42:23.470 --> 42:25.110]  Probably not gonna do that, but it's...
[42:25.110 --> 42:27.170]  Be like, hey, man, I see you at all these things.
[42:27.170 --> 42:27.670]  Hey, brother!
[42:27.910 --> 42:30.330]  And, you know, would you sign this double or nothing?
[42:30.610 --> 42:32.730]  Ray Phoenix and Panta El Zero M.
[42:32.770 --> 42:33.390]  Do you know what they were called?
[42:33.630 --> 42:34.450]  They're the Lucha Brothers.
[42:34.590 --> 42:35.290]  The Lucha Brothers.
[42:35.530 --> 42:35.950]  Yeah, they are.
[42:36.410 --> 42:37.190]  Oh, here we go.
[42:37.490 --> 42:38.350]  These dudes again.
[42:38.630 --> 42:39.650]  The Young Bucks.
[42:39.770 --> 42:40.130]  Whee!
[42:40.230 --> 42:41.950]  And then it's a whole tag team section.
[42:42.030 --> 42:42.590]  And then this guy.
[42:43.370 --> 42:46.270]  Oh, La Faxion Ingo Bernable.
[42:47.150 --> 42:47.870]  They're ungovernable.
[42:48.650 --> 42:50.210]  Oh, an ungovernable faction.
[42:50.210 --> 42:50.830]  Yeah, I like that.
[42:50.830 --> 42:51.430]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:51.470 --> 42:51.950]  That's pretty cool.
[42:51.950 --> 42:54.150]  Preston Vance and Roosh.
[42:54.730 --> 42:56.330]  But now we have more cards to open?
[42:56.590 --> 42:57.970]  Yeah, now, we're not done yet.
[42:58.070 --> 43:01.030]  You'd think we were done, but we're gonna open up some Dick Tracy cards.
[43:01.410 --> 43:01.510]  Ugh.
[43:02.210 --> 43:03.510]  Everybody loves Dick Tracy.
[43:04.190 --> 43:05.150]  You remember that movie?
[43:05.390 --> 43:06.650]  Hey, Dick Tracy, I'm Prune Face.
[43:06.790 --> 43:07.810]  Oh, we're about to see it.
[43:07.870 --> 43:09.370]  Hey, Prune Face, I'm Dick Tracy.
[43:09.890 --> 43:11.090]  Steve the Tramp.
[43:11.870 --> 43:12.670]  Hey, Prune...
[43:12.670 --> 43:13.070]  Ugh.
[43:13.270 --> 43:13.830]  Prune Tracy.
[43:13.910 --> 43:14.930]  He does look like a prune.
[43:14.970 --> 43:15.930]  Calling Dick Tracy.
[43:16.230 --> 43:17.890]  I hate this movie.
[43:18.170 --> 43:19.390]  It's so ugly.
[43:19.570 --> 43:20.610]  Tracy was tarnished.
[43:20.610 --> 43:22.490]  Stop looking at it.
[43:22.490 --> 43:23.450]  Spying on the bad guys.
[43:23.470 --> 43:24.770]  Who did we realize was his sister?
[43:24.790 --> 43:25.910]  Abducted by big boy.
[43:26.010 --> 43:26.750]  That we were surprised by?
[43:26.750 --> 43:27.350]  Who, Dick Tracy?
[43:27.510 --> 43:28.090]  The blank.
[43:28.110 --> 43:28.870]  Warren Beatty.
[43:29.070 --> 43:32.130]  Warren Beatty's sister is...
[43:32.130 --> 43:34.350]  That we didn't believe it.
[43:34.570 --> 43:34.930]  God.
[43:35.030 --> 43:35.810]  It's like...
[43:35.810 --> 43:36.970]  Something crazy.
[43:37.790 --> 43:38.590]  Well, I'm looking it up.
[43:38.630 --> 43:39.210]  You gotta look it up now.
[43:40.010 --> 43:40.410]  Uh, Itchy.
[43:40.790 --> 43:41.370]  Speaking of.
[43:41.910 --> 43:43.250]  Uh, oh, here's Captive Crown Prince.
[43:43.310 --> 43:44.430]  These are in great condition, though.
[43:44.770 --> 43:45.690]  Trust Tess.
[43:46.150 --> 43:47.110]  Wasn't Madonna in this movie?
[43:47.450 --> 43:48.490]  A ride into danger.
[43:49.490 --> 43:50.290]  Confronting Breathless.
[43:50.290 --> 43:51.310]  Shirley MacLaine?
[43:51.490 --> 43:51.710]  Shirley MacLaine.
[43:51.930 --> 43:52.930]  Yes, that's what it was.
[43:53.810 --> 43:55.850]  Warren Beatty and Shirley MacLaine are brother and sister.
[43:55.990 --> 43:56.170]  What?
[43:56.270 --> 43:57.550]  Isn't that nuts?
[43:57.750 --> 43:58.450]  Mike Steiner.
[43:59.210 --> 44:00.650]  Uh, this kid had his faith restored.
[44:01.290 --> 44:01.650]  From prison?
[44:01.650 --> 44:02.290]  That's the kid from...
[44:02.290 --> 44:02.470]  He's in prison.
[44:02.550 --> 44:05.650]  That's the kid from, uh, The Secret Garden who was caught.
[44:05.650 --> 44:06.470]  Oh, that is the kid.
[44:06.630 --> 44:07.030]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[44:07.070 --> 44:07.770]  You're totally right.
[44:07.790 --> 44:09.030]  He's like, I'm gonna box your ears.
[44:09.330 --> 44:10.090]  Mysterious Observer.
[44:10.730 --> 44:11.130]  Cool.
[44:12.050 --> 44:12.710]  Alright, well that was...
[44:12.710 --> 44:13.530]  And the kid from Hook.
[44:13.710 --> 44:14.150]  Kid Tracy.
[44:15.110 --> 44:15.730]  Kid Tracy.
[44:15.990 --> 44:16.170]  What?
[44:16.310 --> 44:16.750]  Dick Tracy.
[44:17.430 --> 44:18.030]  Dick Kid.
[44:18.090 --> 44:18.270]  What?
[44:19.910 --> 44:23.130]  What's something that's, like, super fun and cool that we can open?
[44:23.410 --> 44:24.030]  Super fun and cool?
[44:24.030 --> 44:25.030]  Yeah, what's a cool, fun one?
[44:25.050 --> 44:27.410]  Like, what's something that, uh, I would give a shit about?
[44:27.810 --> 44:28.130]  Oh.
[44:29.290 --> 44:30.930]  Something that Emily would care about.
[44:31.170 --> 44:32.050]  Some Barbie cards.
[44:32.110 --> 44:33.410]  Oh, I do care about that.
[44:33.530 --> 44:34.470]  That might be my pick.
[44:35.210 --> 44:36.330]  Okay, let's see what we got here.
[44:36.350 --> 44:39.170]  Maybe we can find one that matches one of my girls' outfits, even though I already got one.
[44:40.630 --> 44:42.570]  Uh, oh, starting off with 1990 Barbie.
[44:42.670 --> 44:43.210]  Ah, I have that!
[44:43.370 --> 44:43.690]  Wow.
[44:44.010 --> 44:45.890]  It's still in the box at my mom's house.
[44:45.910 --> 44:46.270]  Is it really?
[44:46.330 --> 44:46.630]  Yeah.
[44:46.630 --> 44:47.370]  Are you allowed to play with it?
[44:47.410 --> 44:48.470]  No, you can't open those.
[44:48.950 --> 44:49.530]  You're not allowed to.
[44:49.550 --> 44:50.190]  You're not allowed to.
[44:50.510 --> 44:51.750]  Are those yours or your mom's?
[44:51.810 --> 44:52.530]  They hold value.
[44:52.690 --> 44:54.030]  Are they yours or your mom's?
[44:54.030 --> 44:54.710]  They're mine.
[44:54.810 --> 44:55.410]  But you're not allowed to open them.
[44:55.410 --> 44:56.570]  It was a Christmas Barbie.
[44:56.870 --> 44:57.670]  You're not allowed to open them.
[44:57.670 --> 44:58.650]  Are you allowed to take them?
[44:58.790 --> 44:59.670]  Are you allowed to have them?
[44:59.850 --> 45:02.670]  Yeah, but that means that they would be in our storage unit, but right now I can hide
[45:03.390 --> 45:04.790]  them in my mom's guest room, which she doesn't know.
[45:04.890 --> 45:05.850]  1986 Barbie.
[45:06.030 --> 45:06.670]  Ah, business Barbie.
[45:06.710 --> 45:07.350]  That's the year I was born.
[45:07.670 --> 45:08.510]  1962 Barbie.
[45:08.690 --> 45:09.070]  She's cute.
[45:09.730 --> 45:11.010]  Uh, 1982 Barbie.
[45:11.910 --> 45:13.650]  That is, that's like a 90.
[45:13.850 --> 45:14.590]  Justice for Swellen.
[45:16.350 --> 45:17.150]  1978 Barbie.
[45:18.350 --> 45:20.930]  She's got like a little flamenco dancing dress on.
[45:22.070 --> 45:22.870]  1988 Barbie.
[45:23.090 --> 45:23.430]  She's bootskin.
[45:23.430 --> 45:24.690]  Oh my god, I had that skirt.
[45:25.490 --> 45:26.130]  Yes, I did.
[45:26.370 --> 45:26.510]  I love it.
[45:26.510 --> 45:27.030]  That's awesome.
[45:28.230 --> 45:29.710]  Like in real life or in Barbie's world?
[45:29.730 --> 45:31.950]  Ugh, I wish I had it in real life, but in Barbie's world...
[45:31.950 --> 45:32.450]  1966.
[45:32.850 --> 45:34.930]  It's a very Jackie O. Barbie.
[45:35.050 --> 45:36.030]  You gotta get a hat like that.
[45:36.390 --> 45:37.290]  1989 Barbie.
[45:37.390 --> 45:38.770]  That looks like every girl I knew in 1989.
[45:40.130 --> 45:40.990]  It's like Taylor Swift.
[45:42.050 --> 45:42.850]  1969 Barbie.
[45:43.050 --> 45:43.570]  Oh, cute.
[45:43.570 --> 45:44.610]  And then another 89.
[45:44.810 --> 45:45.170]  Hey.
[45:45.530 --> 45:46.130]  There you go.
[45:46.350 --> 45:47.330]  That's a fun time.
[45:47.770 --> 45:48.130]  1989 Barbie.
[45:48.230 --> 45:50.270]  She's out dancing all night long.
[45:50.310 --> 45:53.670]  That's the Barbie who like, you look at her clothes now and you're like, that was hooker Barbie.
[45:54.010 --> 45:54.230]  Hell yeah.
[45:54.410 --> 45:54.850]  That's awesome.
[45:54.910 --> 45:55.810]  That's my Barbie, baby.
[45:56.290 --> 45:56.550]  Yeah.
[45:57.190 --> 45:58.710]  Then we're gonna open up two packs of Allen and Garfield.
[45:58.710 --> 45:59.970]  Oh, I care about this.
[45:59.970 --> 46:02.190]  And then we're gonna fuck with the Topscurve.
[46:02.370 --> 46:02.630]  Yeah?
[46:02.910 --> 46:03.170]  Yeah.
[46:03.270 --> 46:04.010]  We'll see if we get that at...
[46:04.490 --> 46:04.670]  McDonald's?
[46:04.730 --> 46:05.630]  We had McDonald's today.
[46:06.030 --> 46:06.430]  We did.
[46:06.530 --> 46:08.310]  I wish they'd bring the Nugget Buddies back.
[46:08.350 --> 46:11.070]  They've been doing ads with different Nugget Buddies.
[46:11.170 --> 46:11.350]  Yeah.
[46:11.590 --> 46:12.030]  Yeah, they have.
[46:12.030 --> 46:12.690]  I know, it bugs me.
[46:12.690 --> 46:14.090]  Which makes me think they're gonna bring them back.
[46:14.350 --> 46:16.030]  Did you let Mark have some fries?
[46:16.630 --> 46:17.310]  Mark is your dog.
[46:17.670 --> 46:18.670]  No, he can't have any people food.
[46:18.670 --> 46:19.570]  He can't have people food.
[46:19.690 --> 46:19.890]  Okay.
[46:21.090 --> 46:23.150]  It's amazing that nobody has guessed his name.
[46:23.190 --> 46:23.990]  Ooh, Baby Ruth.
[46:24.950 --> 46:25.670]  Baby Ruth.
[46:26.150 --> 46:29.090]  I watched a TikTok the other day of Babe Ruth giving hitting lessons to kids.
[46:29.150 --> 46:29.610]  It was pretty cool.
[46:29.670 --> 46:30.010]  Whoa, really?
[46:30.210 --> 46:30.330]  Yeah.
[46:30.330 --> 46:31.290]  Did he have a cigarette in his mouth?
[46:31.510 --> 46:33.230]  He was like, there's two ways to hit a ball.
[46:33.410 --> 46:35.210]  There's the full swing and the tap swing.
[46:35.210 --> 46:36.310]  Here, kid, hold my beer.
[46:37.590 --> 46:39.190]  Here's a Stephen Kwan rookie.
[46:39.770 --> 46:40.390]  That's cool.
[46:41.570 --> 46:42.850]  Gleybar Torres.
[46:42.970 --> 46:44.270]  Aaron Judge.
[46:44.370 --> 46:45.070]  Never did anything.
[46:47.290 --> 46:48.770]  Vinnie Pascatano rookie.
[46:48.930 --> 46:49.530]  That's cool.
[46:49.870 --> 46:52.090]  Got ourselves a mini Ricky Henderson.
[46:54.150 --> 46:54.790]  Piano!
[46:58.310 --> 47:00.710]  I want to get a fucking rip card.
[47:01.090 --> 47:01.790]  Yeah, you wish.
[47:02.190 --> 47:02.470]  I do.
[47:02.770 --> 47:04.310]  We still have a bunch of boxes of stuff unopened.
[47:05.310 --> 47:06.430]  Austin Meadows.
[47:07.110 --> 47:08.110]  Alex Bregman.
[47:08.110 --> 47:10.670]  How about a little bit of wisdom, Patrick?
[47:12.390 --> 47:13.610]  Caroline O'Connor.
[47:13.790 --> 47:14.610]  Who's Caroline O'Connor to you?
[47:14.610 --> 47:15.190]  Who's that?
[47:15.510 --> 47:19.850]  Caroline O'Connor is the president of business operations for the Marlins.
[47:20.110 --> 47:20.470]  There you go.
[47:20.570 --> 47:21.450]  Okay, I'll allow it.
[47:21.830 --> 47:22.750]  Salvador Perez.
[47:22.950 --> 47:23.750]  Before I launch into the mud.
[47:23.750 --> 47:24.170]  Salvi.
[47:24.510 --> 47:25.350]  Bo Jackson.
[47:25.650 --> 47:25.910]  Yeah, nice.
[47:25.910 --> 47:27.090]  Speech about why you need a card.
[47:27.350 --> 47:33.030]  I watched a fucking clip of Bo Jackson playing for the Royals the other day where he threw somebody out from left field.
[47:33.030 --> 47:34.070]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:34.150 --> 47:34.530]  See that throw?
[47:35.650 --> 47:36.090]  Insane.
[47:36.410 --> 47:37.870]  Yeah, it's just a fucking, like, laser.
[47:37.870 --> 47:38.710]  Just a laser.
[47:39.110 --> 47:40.190]  It's so fast.
[47:40.250 --> 47:41.530]  He throws it so hard.
[47:42.530 --> 47:42.950]  Kershaw.
[47:43.370 --> 47:44.230]  Doing some shit.
[47:44.430 --> 47:47.050]  And then, ooh, this is France.
[47:47.170 --> 47:48.650]  The Lascaux Cave.
[47:48.990 --> 47:50.490]  It's a wonder in the world.
[47:51.450 --> 47:53.290]  It's a wonder in the world?
[47:53.390 --> 47:54.490]  Yeah, wonder of the world.
[47:54.710 --> 47:56.010]  It's a wonderful world.
[47:56.410 --> 47:57.330]  I suppose so.
[47:57.630 --> 48:00.970]  It looks like the cave at Silver Dollar City, which is where I want to go as well.
[48:01.250 --> 48:01.930]  I can't be stopped.
[48:02.290 --> 48:03.510]  You're doing more, Ginter?
[48:04.270 --> 48:05.430]  It's all I want to open.
[48:05.910 --> 48:07.350]  I mean, why don't we just do an episode?
[48:07.350 --> 48:08.130]  Alan and Ginter podcast.
[48:08.170 --> 48:10.310]  Why don't we just do an episode where it's Alan and Ginter?
[48:10.490 --> 48:11.010]  Maybe we will.
[48:11.670 --> 48:12.070]  Okay.
[48:12.390 --> 48:14.490]  Maybe they'll put you on the card next year.
[48:14.630 --> 48:15.490]  Sorry for the good idea.
[48:15.650 --> 48:16.250]  It's my fault.
[48:16.390 --> 48:17.250]  Bryce Turing, bass rookie.
[48:17.630 --> 48:18.410]  Paul Goldschmidt.
[48:18.810 --> 48:19.930]  Maybe we will, Eric.
[48:19.970 --> 48:20.330]  There you go.
[48:20.330 --> 48:21.290]  Maybe we will.
[48:21.370 --> 48:21.910]  Now we're talking.
[48:21.990 --> 48:22.970]  Javier Baez.
[48:23.990 --> 48:24.390]  Detroit.
[48:25.370 --> 48:26.590]  Who's Dre Jamison?
[48:26.710 --> 48:27.390]  I'm not familiar with him.
[48:27.550 --> 48:29.330]  I wear his hat like a dickhead, but that's a rookie card.
[48:31.090 --> 48:31.890]  Andre Jimenez.
[48:32.950 --> 48:33.750]  Greg Maddox.
[48:34.870 --> 48:36.390]  Ooh, it was Chicago?
[48:36.910 --> 48:38.170]  Yeah, he played for Chicago.
[48:38.230 --> 48:38.950]  Oh, I remember.
[48:39.190 --> 48:41.170]  It's just of the cards that you would put him on.
[48:41.230 --> 48:41.730]  That's not...
[48:41.730 --> 48:43.450]  Oh, you don't associate him with the Cubbies?
[48:43.870 --> 48:44.550]  You do?
[48:45.130 --> 48:46.690]  I was a kid when he played for them.
[48:47.650 --> 48:48.950]  I remember him playing for them.
[48:50.230 --> 48:50.950]  Greg Maddox?
[48:51.170 --> 48:51.710]  When I was a kid.
[48:52.170 --> 48:52.330]  Yeah.
[48:52.570 --> 48:53.690]  In the 90s?
[48:53.830 --> 48:54.030]  Yeah.
[48:54.790 --> 48:56.510]  He was a 20-year-old child.
[48:56.870 --> 48:58.270]  I was 18 in 94.
[48:58.530 --> 49:00.110]  I was still a kid until I was like 30.
[49:01.150 --> 49:01.910]  That's still a kid now.
[49:01.910 --> 49:02.950]  He played for the Braves.
[49:03.390 --> 49:05.050]  I remember for a very long time.
[49:05.090 --> 49:05.710]  Him and John Smoltz.
[49:05.710 --> 49:07.730]  Yeah, and you associate him with the Cubs?
[49:08.410 --> 49:09.810]  I remember him playing for the Cubs.
[49:09.870 --> 49:10.710]  When you were a kid?
[49:11.370 --> 49:11.990]  Yeah, when I was a kid.
[49:12.010 --> 49:14.090]  I was a kid until like five years ago.
[49:14.230 --> 49:15.050]  What the fuck?
[49:15.250 --> 49:16.010]  Angor Watt.
[49:16.250 --> 49:16.530]  Whoa.
[49:16.650 --> 49:17.510]  Mini, that's cool.
[49:18.890 --> 49:20.590]  I think you should do one more Pachybel and a Ginter.
[49:20.790 --> 49:21.170]  Hell yeah.
[49:21.890 --> 49:24.390]  Do one of the big boxes to see if we got a top card.
[49:24.990 --> 49:27.130]  I don't think I have any.
[49:27.150 --> 49:27.810]  Oh, they're not in here.
[49:27.810 --> 49:28.690]  Ginter in here.
[49:28.890 --> 49:29.330]  That's fine.
[49:30.310 --> 49:31.710]  But I do have...
[49:33.570 --> 49:34.410]  this top card.
[49:34.790 --> 49:35.710]  He gave up.
[49:37.310 --> 49:38.290]  A bunch of nonsense.
[49:38.570 --> 49:38.830]  Okay.
[49:39.570 --> 49:40.870]  What if we got...
[49:40.870 --> 49:41.870]  We're gonna get either...
[49:41.870 --> 49:45.010]  We're gonna get a Brawny and 700 people I haven't heard of yet.
[49:45.330 --> 49:46.370]  Because they're all in high school.
[49:46.450 --> 49:46.690]  Yet.
[49:47.210 --> 49:47.990]  Here we go.
[49:48.370 --> 49:49.690]  First pack goes to pack sack.
[49:50.090 --> 49:50.770]  Let's do it.
[49:51.030 --> 49:52.830]  Here we go.
[49:53.590 --> 49:55.330]  Two autograph cards per box.
[49:55.510 --> 49:56.890]  So we're guaranteed two autographs.
[49:57.910 --> 49:58.970]  How sad would it be...
[50:00.570 --> 50:01.670]  if we didn't get a Brawny?
[50:01.790 --> 50:02.410]  How sad?
[50:02.670 --> 50:03.530]  How sad will it be?
[50:04.790 --> 50:05.710]  Omaha Blue.
[50:06.130 --> 50:06.790]  Aaron Bradshaw.
[50:07.990 --> 50:09.710]  Reed Shepard Silver Parallel.
[50:10.210 --> 50:10.670]  Number one.
[50:10.810 --> 50:12.630]  Omaha Blue again.
[50:13.030 --> 50:14.190]  That's a name as a place.
[50:14.570 --> 50:14.850]  Thank you.
[50:15.030 --> 50:15.350]  Okay.
[50:15.470 --> 50:15.870]  Name as a place.
[50:15.930 --> 50:16.250]  There you go.
[50:18.450 --> 50:19.430]  That's a good call, Emily.
[50:19.790 --> 50:20.410]  Thank you.
[50:22.050 --> 50:23.130]  Isaiah Collier.
[50:24.230 --> 50:25.040]  Madison Booker.
[50:25.410 --> 50:26.050]  Holy shit.
[50:26.110 --> 50:26.850]  That's a cool parallel.
[50:27.750 --> 50:29.670]  Kaimora Johnson Blue Sparkle Parallel.
[50:29.990 --> 50:30.990]  That's a cool card.
[50:31.390 --> 50:32.490]  Tops a good person.
[50:32.590 --> 50:33.670]  This is number two.
[50:34.270 --> 50:35.070]  Ninety-nine.
[50:35.150 --> 50:36.530]  So there you go.
[50:39.830 --> 50:40.630]  Andres Stajankovic.
[50:42.030 --> 50:44.110]  He puts the Stajank on it.
[50:44.230 --> 50:44.690]  It's cool.
[50:44.750 --> 50:49.870]  When you watch this video in like four years and this is the best player in the NBA and we can't say his name, just you can make fun of us.
[50:50.090 --> 50:50.130]  Yeah.
[50:50.270 --> 50:50.910]  Leave a comment.
[50:51.210 --> 50:52.910]  Leave a comment that says I'm from the future.
[50:53.330 --> 50:54.170]  I'll make fun of you.
[50:54.330 --> 50:55.130]  It's Wim Benyama.
[50:56.550 --> 50:57.610]  Jeremy Fiers Jr.
[50:57.770 --> 50:59.010]  Justin Edwards Silver.
[51:00.510 --> 51:01.310]  Mikaela Williams.
[51:01.690 --> 51:02.790]  Future Stars Parallel.
[51:04.850 --> 51:05.570]  Courtney Ogden.
[51:07.410 --> 51:09.110]  You feel like they're figuring it out with Wim Benyama?
[51:09.570 --> 51:12.550]  Do you think they're finally like passing it to him?
[51:12.890 --> 51:14.950]  I think HEB figured it out with their commercials.
[51:15.170 --> 51:15.690]  Dude, how?
[51:15.910 --> 51:17.830]  They stack up all the ice cream and the creature's there.
[51:18.010 --> 51:23.030]  Can we talk about the real winner of Victor Wim Benyama going into the NBA?
[51:23.190 --> 51:23.590]  Who's that?
[51:23.690 --> 51:24.250]  It's HEB.
[51:24.470 --> 51:24.830]  Oh, yeah.
[51:25.050 --> 51:26.030]  Because they have that deal.
[51:26.310 --> 51:29.130]  If you're not familiar, in Texas, we have a grocery store called HEB.
[51:29.190 --> 51:30.690]  It's the best grocery store on Earth.
[51:30.730 --> 51:31.510]  Here, everything's better.
[51:31.510 --> 51:34.890]  Anybody in Texas will agree with this and tell you.
[51:35.190 --> 51:37.010]  And you just gotta go to know.
[51:37.610 --> 51:40.230]  But they have a partnership with the San Antonio Spurs.
[51:40.350 --> 51:40.710]  Have forever.
[51:40.970 --> 51:46.630]  So, for the last 20 years, I've been having to watch Manu Ginocchi hunt ice cream and fucking strawberries and shit.
[51:46.830 --> 51:47.690]  Or Tony Parker.
[51:47.990 --> 51:49.910]  Or Tim Duncan, who acts like wood.
[51:50.110 --> 51:51.850]  He's a wonderful basketball player.
[51:51.990 --> 51:52.950]  A big fundamental, baby.
[51:53.050 --> 51:55.190]  Big fundamental, but just can't act his way out of a box.
[51:55.190 --> 52:01.030]  However, this Jeremy SoShan, Victor Wim and Yama thing, where they have funny colored ice cream hair.
[52:01.370 --> 52:02.930]  They're doing a bunch of...
[52:02.930 --> 52:04.190]  They got a bunch of commercials.
[52:04.330 --> 52:04.790]  They're all good.
[52:05.330 --> 52:06.370]  Kids can already act.
[52:06.370 --> 52:08.170]  Having fun and everything.
[52:08.270 --> 52:09.630]  Did you see what happened the other night at the game?
[52:10.350 --> 52:10.890]  What game?
[52:11.090 --> 52:11.890]  The Spurs game?
[52:12.030 --> 52:12.810]  There was a bat.
[52:13.390 --> 52:14.450]  Oh, I did see that.
[52:14.510 --> 52:14.810]  Yeah, yeah.
[52:14.870 --> 52:15.490]  Bat on the...
[52:16.030 --> 52:17.550]  Another bat on the court.
[52:17.950 --> 52:21.530]  So, the creature dressed up like Batman and Manu Ginobili was there.
[52:21.630 --> 52:23.230]  And they caught the bat with a net.
[52:23.770 --> 52:24.870]  The creature caught a bat.
[52:24.870 --> 52:26.810]  And he already had the Batman costume ready?
[52:26.970 --> 52:28.250]  Oh, it's not the first time this has happened.
[52:28.390 --> 52:30.430]  This is a pretty regular occurrence.
[52:31.210 --> 52:31.570]  Weird.
[52:31.830 --> 52:33.690]  Waves parallel Jade and Donovan.
[52:33.750 --> 52:37.610]  It doesn't make the news anymore because it happens so frequently.
[52:38.050 --> 52:38.410]  Wow.
[52:38.850 --> 52:39.790]  Manu Ginobili was there.
[52:39.870 --> 52:40.890]  I hate him, by the way.
[52:41.110 --> 52:42.570]  I've hated him for a very long time.
[52:42.910 --> 52:43.710]  But he said...
[52:43.710 --> 52:47.150]  He had one of the funniest fucking tweets or exes or whatever you call it.
[52:47.370 --> 52:49.990]  Where it's just a picture of him looking like he's half asleep at the game.
[52:50.430 --> 52:52.910]  And he's like, I can't believe I used to be on the court this late at night.
[52:53.310 --> 52:54.850]  He can't even stay awake in the crowd.
[52:54.910 --> 52:55.910]  He's like, it's after 9 p.m.
[52:56.030 --> 52:56.670]  That's fucking great.
[52:57.810 --> 52:59.170]  Kobe Williams, Zoey Brooks.
[52:59.350 --> 52:59.690]  Oh, shit.
[52:59.750 --> 53:00.230]  Here's our auto.
[53:02.870 --> 53:03.590]  McKenzie Mogabo.
[53:03.790 --> 53:05.710]  But it's on...
[53:05.710 --> 53:06.010]  McBaco.
[53:06.210 --> 53:06.790]  Like on sticker?
[53:07.330 --> 53:07.570]  Yeah.
[53:07.690 --> 53:08.650]  What is that parallel to?
[53:08.690 --> 53:09.170]  That's really cool.
[53:09.370 --> 53:09.470]  Yeah.
[53:10.070 --> 53:10.430]  Sticker.
[53:10.970 --> 53:11.330]  Congratulations.
[53:11.590 --> 53:11.810]  It's...
[53:11.810 --> 53:12.190]  Oh, shit.
[53:12.270 --> 53:13.190]  Number 25.
[53:13.350 --> 53:14.050]  Oh, wow.
[53:14.330 --> 53:14.630]  Autographed car.
[53:14.630 --> 53:15.250]  Oh, that's really cool.
[53:15.470 --> 53:15.710]  Yeah.
[53:16.290 --> 53:18.550]  Please have a huge NBA career and I can buy a car.
[53:21.470 --> 53:22.030]  Modest Bezels.
[53:22.090 --> 53:23.090]  Let's see what our next auto is.
[53:23.090 --> 53:24.150]  So would this be our only auto?
[53:24.350 --> 53:24.810]  There's two.
[53:24.950 --> 53:25.650]  There's two in there.
[53:25.950 --> 53:28.570]  If we don't get a second one, it's probably in the pack sack.
[53:28.850 --> 53:33.750]  And that means if we don't get the second one, that means we should definitely go to the pack sack and grab it.
[53:33.910 --> 53:34.990]  Here's McKenzie again.
[53:35.210 --> 53:35.830]  Silver parallel.
[53:36.470 --> 53:36.750]  Tessa.
[53:39.990 --> 53:45.470]  It's fun to think that these kids right now, eight years from now, seven, eight years from now.
[53:45.510 --> 53:46.330]  We've got a little bit of time ahead of them.
[53:46.390 --> 53:48.050]  Could be the best basketball players in the world.
[53:48.470 --> 53:48.830]  Yeah.
[53:49.110 --> 53:49.910]  Aaron Bradshaw.
[53:50.670 --> 53:51.390]  Aiden Holloway.
[53:51.710 --> 53:53.390]  All-American silver parallel.
[53:53.890 --> 53:54.310]  Jada Williams.
[53:54.430 --> 53:55.210]  I think those are all silver.
[53:55.410 --> 53:58.950]  Like, how you feel about that is why I love Independent Pro Wrestling.
[53:59.090 --> 54:03.170]  Because it's all the same people and you're going to be like, oh, in ten years, these are the people that are, like, headlining everything.
[54:03.410 --> 54:04.450]  Jaden Donovan, silver parallel.
[54:04.570 --> 54:05.070]  That's nice.
[54:05.210 --> 54:06.290]  McKenzie and Xavier Booker.
[54:06.490 --> 54:09.210]  Still not a single, not even a, not even a base player.
[54:09.210 --> 54:09.510]  Nuh-uh.
[54:09.870 --> 54:10.150]  Nuh-uh.
[54:10.770 --> 54:11.130]  Wild.
[54:12.250 --> 54:13.770]  Do you think the Creature's in here?
[54:13.810 --> 54:16.310]  Do you think that we'll get a Creature, a card of the San Antonio Spirit?
[54:16.310 --> 54:16.570]  Of course, dude.
[54:16.710 --> 54:18.630]  I hope we get, I hope we do.
[54:18.870 --> 54:19.730]  Who's your favorite mascot?
[54:20.030 --> 54:20.590]  Aiden Holloway.
[54:21.090 --> 54:22.190]  Aliyah Del Rosario.
[54:22.550 --> 54:23.510]  I love the swinging fryer.
[54:24.090 --> 54:24.470]  What's that?
[54:24.710 --> 54:25.610]  The Padres mascot.
[54:26.250 --> 54:28.150]  He's a fryer and he swings a baseball bat.
[54:29.210 --> 54:29.550]  He's pretty cool.
[54:29.750 --> 54:29.930]  Friar?
[54:30.250 --> 54:30.750]  Like a monk.
[54:30.890 --> 54:31.150]  Padre.
[54:32.110 --> 54:32.470]  Oh.
[54:33.130 --> 54:34.010]  Is that why they're called that?
[54:34.150 --> 54:34.270]  What?
[54:34.470 --> 54:35.110]  A. Cunningham.
[54:35.130 --> 54:35.330]  What?
[54:35.610 --> 54:38.250]  Yeah, what did you think, what did you think the Padres were?
[54:38.250 --> 54:38.910]  The daddies?
[54:39.370 --> 54:39.730]  I don't know.
[54:39.890 --> 54:40.130]  Yeah.
[54:40.730 --> 54:41.090]  Run on.
[54:41.170 --> 54:43.750]  But like a, like a church, like it's a religious thing?
[54:44.050 --> 54:44.890]  I guess so, yeah.
[54:44.970 --> 54:45.270]  What's that?
[54:45.270 --> 54:46.850]  It's a fucking cool card is what it is.
[54:46.950 --> 54:51.390]  It's not Bronny, but it is a Kimora Johnson McDonald's parallel.
[54:51.710 --> 54:54.450]  You can see the golden arches in the card.
[54:54.530 --> 54:54.930]  Oh!
[54:54.930 --> 54:55.470]  Isn't that cool?
[54:55.670 --> 54:56.750]  I've never seen that before.
[54:56.850 --> 54:57.110]  Oh, crazy.
[54:57.270 --> 54:58.330]  That is so fucking neat.
[54:58.410 --> 54:58.810]  That's neat.
[54:59.030 --> 54:59.570]  That is awesome.
[54:59.850 --> 55:00.090]  Great.
[55:00.510 --> 55:05.610]  Yeah, I would say that maybe the, remember, you ever see the Chargers mascot Boltman?
[55:05.930 --> 55:06.110]  Uh-huh.
[55:06.190 --> 55:08.450]  And he's like an insane lightning boltman with sunglasses on?
[55:08.610 --> 55:11.570]  I don't know that he's a favorite anymore, but boy, he's got a soft spot in my heart.
[55:11.570 --> 55:12.950]  Because he just looks insane.
[55:13.230 --> 55:16.030]  And then, uh, I think the Creature's definitely up there.
[55:16.130 --> 55:17.610]  The San Antonio Creature is pretty cool.
[55:17.730 --> 55:18.270]  He's pretty great.
[55:18.350 --> 55:18.550]  Yeah.
[55:18.770 --> 55:21.830]  I'm having a hard time hating San Antonio right now, and I really want to.
[55:21.910 --> 55:22.530]  Yeah, I get it.
[55:22.650 --> 55:23.190]  Jada Williams.
[55:23.650 --> 55:26.650]  I've hated him for so, for most of my life as a basketball team.
[55:27.150 --> 55:31.570]  And, uh, I'd say they're historically my, easily my least favorite basketball team.
[55:31.610 --> 55:32.070]  Wow, really?
[55:32.270 --> 55:33.950]  Yeah, but I like Keldon Johnson.
[55:34.370 --> 55:35.530]  Obviously, everybody likes Victor.
[55:35.650 --> 55:36.950]  I kind of like So Chan.
[55:37.150 --> 55:38.290]  I like, he had a lot of fun.
[55:38.650 --> 55:40.430]  Devin Vassell, I believe, is a coach on him.
[55:40.430 --> 55:40.850]  He's pretty good.
[55:41.690 --> 55:42.170]  KK Arnold.
[55:42.430 --> 55:43.370]  I used to be that player that looked like you.
[55:43.390 --> 55:43.870]  Oh, shit.
[55:44.190 --> 55:44.430]  Shit.
[55:45.210 --> 55:46.010]  Can we see it?
[55:46.350 --> 55:46.610]  Not yet.
[55:46.650 --> 55:47.190]  He'll get to it.
[55:47.310 --> 55:48.050]  I'm so excited.
[55:48.250 --> 55:48.530]  Here we go.
[55:48.750 --> 55:49.610]  Melissa Fulway.
[55:49.690 --> 55:49.850]  Yep.
[55:50.290 --> 55:50.690]  Kimberly Dresden.
[55:51.030 --> 55:51.870]  An actual hit.
[55:52.330 --> 55:53.970]  A brawny silver...
[55:53.970 --> 55:54.650]  Oh, wow.
[55:54.790 --> 55:55.110]  Chrome.
[55:55.330 --> 55:55.730]  Nice.
[55:56.170 --> 55:57.050]  That's actually pretty nice.
[55:57.110 --> 55:57.730]  Sleeve it, baby.
[55:58.490 --> 55:59.770]  I think it's not numbered or anything.
[56:00.190 --> 56:00.450]  But it is.
[56:00.690 --> 56:02.050]  And tops, they call them refractors.
[56:02.090 --> 56:03.490]  So this is a chrome refractor.
[56:03.830 --> 56:05.530]  That's the equivalent of a silver point.
[56:05.530 --> 56:06.310]  Very cool.
[56:06.450 --> 56:06.810]  Whee!
[56:07.450 --> 56:08.090]  That's actually a hit.
[56:08.090 --> 56:08.790]  That's fun for you.
[56:08.790 --> 56:10.390]  I wonder what's fun for all of us.
[56:10.390 --> 56:11.250]  It's fun for all of us.
[56:11.590 --> 56:13.090]  Emily, do you have a favorite mascot?
[56:14.830 --> 56:15.230]  Uh...
[56:15.230 --> 56:18.850]  Well, I love the elephant from the WNBA, the New York one.
[56:19.430 --> 56:20.370]  I think his name's Ellie.
[56:20.470 --> 56:21.010]  The sexy Ellie.
[56:21.310 --> 56:22.050]  She's great.
[56:22.150 --> 56:22.970]  What about the...
[56:23.830 --> 56:24.650]  Oh, there's your other Otto.
[56:24.650 --> 56:24.930]  There's your other Otto.
[56:25.490 --> 56:25.650]  Yep.
[56:27.310 --> 56:28.110]  What about...
[56:28.110 --> 56:30.610]  I think his name's Stompy or Stomper or something.
[56:30.850 --> 56:31.710]  The fucking...
[56:31.710 --> 56:32.050]  Alabama?
[56:32.370 --> 56:34.050]  No, the mascot for the A's.
[56:34.210 --> 56:34.810]  Isn't that his name?
[56:34.890 --> 56:35.390]  Is that his name?
[56:35.510 --> 56:35.990]  I think so.
[56:36.150 --> 56:36.970]  I'm surprised.
[56:36.970 --> 56:42.350]  I feel like there's one mascot that Emily loves above all other mascots, and I'm amazed
[56:42.350 --> 56:43.050]  she's not picking him.
[56:43.290 --> 56:46.150]  I mean, I love the Philly Fanatic, and I love...
[56:48.050 --> 56:48.450]  Well...
[56:48.450 --> 56:50.150]  Rip, gone too soon.
[56:50.370 --> 56:50.830]  Ugga just died.
[56:50.830 --> 56:51.870]  Ugga just died.
[56:52.230 --> 56:54.130]  The bulldog from the University of Georgia.
[56:54.510 --> 56:56.190]  His name's Ugga because it's the University of Georgia.
[56:56.310 --> 56:56.650]  Oh, okay.
[56:56.850 --> 57:03.050]  And the family that owns him, every time they die, they get a new one, and then they care
[57:03.510 --> 57:05.010]  for Ugga and take him to the games and stuff.
[57:05.010 --> 57:09.790]  And Ugga, they stay in their own little air-conditioned house because it's so hot in Georgia.
[57:10.070 --> 57:13.950]  But yeah, the Ugga just passed away, so they'll have a new one next year, but...
[57:13.950 --> 57:14.950]  He was the eighth Ugga.
[57:14.970 --> 57:16.050]  So sad.
[57:16.830 --> 57:19.090]  How many Longhorns have they had?
[57:19.530 --> 57:20.970]  How many Bevos are there or whatever?
[57:21.390 --> 57:23.830]  Bevo once charged at Ugga at a game.
[57:23.830 --> 57:24.310]  I saw that.
[57:24.370 --> 57:24.950]  That's true.
[57:25.250 --> 57:26.310]  And that was cool.
[57:26.990 --> 57:28.890]  Ugga almost had to fuck that guy up.
[57:28.890 --> 57:30.050]  Ugga almost had to have their bulldog...
[57:30.050 --> 57:31.610]  I want to watch a dog fight a cow.
[57:31.690 --> 57:33.210]  Dude, Ugga would take that fucker down.
[57:33.210 --> 57:34.090]  There have been 15 Bevos?
[57:34.530 --> 57:36.110]  Have you ever met Bevo, Gracie?
[57:37.810 --> 57:38.510]  I've been close.
[57:38.930 --> 57:39.810]  I've been close!
[57:40.090 --> 57:41.110]  Guys, we got a third Otto.
[57:41.290 --> 57:42.210]  Woo, we got a third Otto?
[57:42.450 --> 57:42.910]  Yeah, we did.
[57:43.050 --> 57:43.370]  How?
[57:43.730 --> 57:44.170]  I don't know.
[57:44.770 --> 57:45.250]  That's rare.
[57:45.450 --> 57:48.090]  Jon Stewart, Jared McCain, and, uh...
[57:50.950 --> 57:51.590]  Andres Dojakovic.
[57:51.670 --> 57:52.650]  Hey, the guy that you said!
[57:52.650 --> 57:53.490]  Is that the guy with the name?
[57:53.490 --> 57:54.050]  That's the guy!
[57:54.210 --> 57:54.710]  Yeah, the guy with the name.
[57:54.750 --> 57:58.070]  Dude, if we can't say this guy's name and he's a hit, make fun of us so fucking hard,
[57:58.110 --> 57:59.650]  I'm making fun of you, bro.
[57:59.830 --> 58:00.130]  Please do.
[58:00.130 --> 58:04.010]  Well, if you make fun of us so hard when he's super big and we sell this for a car,
[58:04.010 --> 58:06.110]  we'll put your username on our license plate.
[58:06.650 --> 58:10.650]  You know what we found out today at the vet?
[58:10.850 --> 58:11.070]  What's that?
[58:11.130 --> 58:14.390]  We had to take a little baby dog, whose name I can't say,
[58:15.090 --> 58:17.990]  we take him in to get his shots, his latest round of shots,
[58:18.050 --> 58:20.310]  so that he can be around other dogs and stuff now, essentially.
[58:21.410 --> 58:24.990]  We found out today that he's gonna need nose surgery when he's six months old.
[58:25.010 --> 58:26.490]  Because they're such little freaks.
[58:26.510 --> 58:29.770]  I was gonna say, wow, no way, the dog that breathes like this already?
[58:31.470 --> 58:33.430]  Yeah, apparently he's got it extra bad.
[58:34.890 --> 58:37.990]  They opened up his... it's basically, I was telling Gracie,
[58:38.110 --> 58:40.570]  that it's kind of like the surgery they do for people with sleep apnea,
[58:40.790 --> 58:42.250]  where it's like they take out the soft palate.
[58:42.370 --> 58:43.310]  It's good that...
[58:43.310 --> 58:45.130]  Your dog has sleep apnea, but he's awake?
[58:45.450 --> 58:46.510]  Yeah, he has awake apnea.
[58:46.550 --> 58:47.550]  He has awake apnea?
[58:47.770 --> 58:50.410]  So he'll get that later when he's older, when they fix him,
[58:50.490 --> 58:51.910]  when they take his little balls out.
[58:51.990 --> 58:53.130]  Did you get a Shouhei Otani card?
[58:53.290 --> 58:54.110]  Yeah, just a base card.
[58:54.170 --> 58:54.810]  But I was gonna show this.
[58:55.050 --> 58:57.330]  I saw this at Walmart, it's like a $6 pack,
[58:57.490 --> 58:59.550]  and in it is Topps Japanese baseball.
[59:00.070 --> 59:00.530]  One pack.
[59:00.650 --> 59:02.890]  And then you get some free regular Topps cards.
[59:02.890 --> 59:03.390]  So I bought this.
[59:03.730 --> 59:05.310]  Are the other ones all angels?
[59:06.250 --> 59:06.970]  Uh, yeah.
[59:07.390 --> 59:09.150]  Yeah, he's got like a pack of like various angels.
[59:09.270 --> 59:09.810]  That's a good catch.
[59:09.910 --> 59:10.150]  How weird.
[59:11.070 --> 59:12.130]  So let's see what these are.
[59:12.350 --> 59:13.370]  The other one's like Rendon, and it made me go, ew.
[59:15.410 --> 59:15.770]  Uh...
[59:17.390 --> 59:18.110]  Takeru Sasaki.
[59:18.710 --> 59:20.230]  Are these Japanese teams?
[59:20.570 --> 59:21.810]  Yuki Yamagita.
[59:22.410 --> 59:22.990]  Japanese teams, yep.
[59:23.110 --> 59:23.770]  That's the soft palate.
[59:23.910 --> 59:24.110]  Kiyota.
[59:25.530 --> 59:26.890]  This guy's name is just Brandon.
[59:27.430 --> 59:31.110]  Well, I mean, not everyone is from Japan that plays in the Japanese league.
[59:31.230 --> 59:32.330]  Yeah, but his name is just Brandon.
[59:32.330 --> 59:33.210]  He doesn't have a last name.
[59:33.310 --> 59:35.210]  He probably has a last name.
[59:35.270 --> 59:36.190]  It just says Brandon.
[59:36.930 --> 59:37.830]  He's Brandon.
[59:37.930 --> 59:38.470]  He plays infield.
[59:38.510 --> 59:41.030]  There's no other Brandon on the teams.
[59:41.110 --> 59:42.250]  Can you sleeve Brandon, please?
[59:43.910 --> 59:44.470]  Uh...
[59:44.470 --> 59:45.370]  Hikaru Oda.
[59:46.270 --> 59:47.530]  Yeah, wow.
[59:47.570 --> 59:48.410]  This guy...
[59:48.410 --> 59:49.070]  He plays for the Lions.
[59:49.250 --> 59:50.130]  Shota Suzuki.
[59:52.130 --> 59:52.690]  Minataka.
[59:53.870 --> 59:54.430]  Kazuma.
[59:55.130 --> 59:57.730]  You're better at reading these than hockey names.
[59:58.390 --> 59:59.170]  Yeah, I'm trying here.
[01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:01.050]  Uh...
[01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:02.650]  Koji Chikamoto.
[01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:06.190]  Tsubasa Kato.
[01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:09.430]  Tsubasa Aizawa.
[01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:10.770]  We got two Tsubasas in a row.
[01:00:11.070 --> 01:00:11.430]  Wow.
[01:00:12.010 --> 01:00:12.770]  Related by first name.
[01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:14.950]  And then...
[01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:18.830]  Masahashi Itohi.
[01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:21.830]  So after they say their name, do they say their position or something?
[01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:23.570]  That's a pitcher. He's a pitcher.
[01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:26.210]  Brandon, it meant that he was left field on there.
[01:00:26.350 --> 01:00:27.790]  Oh, I thought it said infield, but it's an LF.
[01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:28.670]  Or maybe IF.
[01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:30.310]  Someone in the chat, because I'm...
[01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:31.490]  Yeah, that's his...
[01:00:31.850 --> 01:00:33.770]  They thought that was his last name, but it's not.
[01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:34.610]  It's just his position.
[01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:37.670]  And then there's the cool rookie cards.
[01:00:37.770 --> 01:00:39.050]  They have little RCs on them.
[01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:39.670]  I've never seen these before.
[01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:40.310]  All right, I'm going to pull those.
[01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:42.530]  Hey, I guess that's it for us today.
[01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:46.870]  We didn't get a Brawny autograph, but we did get a Brawny silver refractor,
[01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:48.250]  which in itself is pretty fucking cool.
[01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:50.490]  I'll have to look it up, but I bet it's a $100 card.
[01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:54.930]  Well, stay tuned for more of this show.
[01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:57.130]  We'll be back next week, I think.
[01:00:57.130 --> 01:00:58.930]  Unless it's a holiday, or is holiday in two weeks?
[01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:01.410]  There's President's Day someday.
[01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:03.370]  Two weeks, and who knows?
[01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:05.750]  Maybe the Allie and Ginter episode is next week.
[01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:06.730]  Who can say?
[01:01:08.550 --> 01:01:12.090]  Gracie's holding up the number three now, and that'll do it for us here.
[01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:14.110]  Go watch Does It Do, please, and leave a comment and say,
[01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:15.670]  Wow, I love Does It Do.
[01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:17.630]  Listen to So All Right and clutch my pearls.
[01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:19.790]  If you don't, Eric will kill you.
[01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:21.470]  Yeah, I'll kill you. I don't care.
[01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:22.550]  What the fuck ever.
[01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:23.450]  Here, camera on me.
[01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:25.050]  I'll kill you. It doesn't bother me.
[01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:29.810]  Eww, scary.
