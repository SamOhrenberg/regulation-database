[00:10.800 --> 00:14.480]  Hello and welcome to the FaceBreak Show!
[00:14.740 --> 00:19.980]  My name is Geoff Ramsey and with me as always, my beautiful wife, Emily Hatfield Ramsey.
[00:20.400 --> 00:24.120]  And my other partner in life, Eric Badour Ramsey.
[00:24.200 --> 00:25.160]  Save that for Gavin.
[00:25.380 --> 00:30.320]  And Eric, I don't know if you've picked up on this, Eric's in a silly mood.
[00:30.340 --> 00:33.140]  I'm a little bit of a goofy guy.
[00:33.420 --> 00:37.260]  Found out the difference between squirrels and chipmunks, been learning a lot about them.
[00:38.420 --> 00:39.860]  Tails, big, big difference.
[00:40.820 --> 00:42.200]  Stripes, another big difference.
[00:42.860 --> 00:47.200]  Also, chipmunks, ground creatures, squirrels are boreal.
[00:47.600 --> 00:50.660]  Also, no such thing as a squirrel rescue ranger.
[00:52.660 --> 00:54.700]  There's no such thing as a squirrel rescue ranger.
[00:54.720 --> 00:55.400]  That's true.
[00:55.780 --> 00:58.840]  But it's the squirrels in Sword and the Stone that are like us.
[01:00.480 --> 01:01.140]  We're in love.
[01:01.400 --> 01:02.600]  There you go. We're in love.
[01:02.760 --> 01:03.380]  I'm like the owl.
[01:03.380 --> 01:07.560]  Do you know that all the squirrels up north are different colors?
[01:08.240 --> 01:09.740]  They're all dead. They're not real.
[01:10.080 --> 01:13.200]  Like the ones in Michigan are black.
[01:13.260 --> 01:14.140]  Yeah, they have black squirrels.
[01:14.140 --> 01:14.620]  Completely black.
[01:15.560 --> 01:17.360]  And then ours here are like a light brown.
[01:17.720 --> 01:19.100]  They're like orange squirrels.
[01:19.360 --> 01:22.740]  They're somewhere in Missouri or Arkansas where they're like a bunch of...
[01:22.740 --> 01:23.180]  Missouri.
[01:23.700 --> 01:25.680]  A bunch of white ones where they're all like albino.
[01:25.980 --> 01:28.300]  Hey, audience, what are the squirrels like where you live?
[01:28.540 --> 01:32.560]  Leave a comment below and let us know what squirrels look like where you are.
[01:32.560 --> 01:35.100]  And also let us know if the weather is... ooh, it's worse.
[01:37.700 --> 01:39.560]  We've got a lot to do today.
[01:39.960 --> 01:40.020]  We do?
[01:40.280 --> 01:44.860]  As always, I want to go through and I graded some cards, let you know what they're worth.
[01:44.940 --> 01:45.100]  Okay.
[01:45.240 --> 01:46.200]  That we opened last week.
[01:46.340 --> 01:51.120]  I bought a box of the Stadium Club hobby and I thought it'd be fun to open the newest box of Stadium Club
[01:51.120 --> 01:54.560]  and then open some of the original Stadium Club cards that I've had for a long time.
[01:54.840 --> 01:56.180]  Got a Platinum Baseball that I bought.
[01:56.180 --> 01:58.100]  Oh, is that the one we're opening? That's the last of the main event?
[01:58.180 --> 01:59.480]  It could be Carl Hubble.
[01:59.940 --> 02:00.500]  Who's that?
[02:00.600 --> 02:00.880]  I don't know.
[02:00.880 --> 02:03.280]  It could be Ted Williams. Do you know who that is?
[02:03.360 --> 02:04.700]  Could be Jackie Robinson.
[02:05.300 --> 02:08.560]  Do you think it's... do you think it's Jackie Robinson?
[02:08.820 --> 02:10.000]  That'd be so cool. It could be...
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.580]  Oh, it could be Kirby Puckett.
[02:11.660 --> 02:12.340]  Hey, all right.
[02:12.360 --> 02:13.380]  Wait, why do I know that name?
[02:13.540 --> 02:14.100]  Kirby Puckett?
[02:14.240 --> 02:14.500]  Yeah.
[02:14.620 --> 02:15.220]  He's a baseball player.
[02:15.420 --> 02:16.940]  Former Minnesota Twin, Garcoma.
[02:18.020 --> 02:19.920]  What's Ted Williams famous for other than being baseball?
[02:20.060 --> 02:21.500]  Like, is there... you know, like some...
[02:21.500 --> 02:22.360]  Frozen Head.
[02:22.760 --> 02:23.640]  That's what it is.
[02:24.460 --> 02:25.180]  That's what it is.
[02:25.200 --> 02:27.200]  Mariano Rivera, Mike Trout, never heard of him.
[02:27.260 --> 02:29.320]  Aaron Judge, Bryce Harper, Nolan Ryan.
[02:29.320 --> 02:31.360]  So yeah, there's some fun stuff in there.
[02:31.480 --> 02:33.700]  Also, Emily bought these two...
[02:33.700 --> 02:34.600]  I'll show them this way.
[02:34.940 --> 02:36.200]  Disney pine boxes.
[02:36.560 --> 02:36.860]  Cutie Cuff.
[02:37.240 --> 02:37.940]  Cutie Cuff.
[02:38.080 --> 02:39.220]  And Squishems.
[02:39.500 --> 02:39.600]  Yeah.
[02:40.120 --> 02:42.800]  It could be a Disney princess, or it could be a Cutie Cuff,
[02:42.920 --> 02:45.000]  which I'm hoping to get Dumbo, because he's the cutest.
[02:45.180 --> 02:45.600]  I want Tigger.
[02:46.480 --> 02:46.740]  Yeah.
[02:46.960 --> 02:48.500]  Who's your favorite Disney princess?
[02:49.800 --> 02:50.820]  I like all of them.
[02:50.860 --> 02:51.600]  Who don't I like?
[02:52.060 --> 02:53.480]  Do you have a favorite Disney princess?
[02:53.820 --> 02:55.900]  I... I don't think so.
[02:56.820 --> 02:57.620]  I don't know.
[02:58.740 --> 03:00.360]  Gracie, who's your favorite Disney princess?
[03:01.360 --> 03:01.700]  Ariel.
[03:02.120 --> 03:02.900]  She's under the sea.
[03:03.020 --> 03:04.240]  Does Merida count?
[03:04.400 --> 03:05.000]  Is she a princess?
[03:05.840 --> 03:06.180]  Yeah.
[03:06.500 --> 03:07.280]  I like her.
[03:07.900 --> 03:08.980]  That's the one that Millie liked.
[03:09.340 --> 03:11.520]  I'm going to say Belle, because that's probably my wife's favorite.
[03:11.700 --> 03:12.580]  She has all the books.
[03:13.280 --> 03:14.720]  Who's the one on the... is that Jasmine?
[03:15.320 --> 03:16.400]  Jasmine's on the Magic Carpet ride.
[03:16.400 --> 03:16.920]  She's a princess, right?
[03:17.360 --> 03:17.780]  I'll do her.
[03:17.780 --> 03:18.740]  Don't you dare close your eyes.
[03:19.400 --> 03:21.380]  I've never even seen that movie, but I like the song.
[03:21.520 --> 03:22.180]  You've never seen Aladdin?
[03:22.380 --> 03:23.740]  I went and saw it when I was a kid.
[03:23.780 --> 03:25.540]  Aladdin came out, and I went to see it.
[03:25.540 --> 03:26.260]  My cousin took me.
[03:26.740 --> 03:29.740]  She's probably 10 or 15 years older than me.
[03:30.200 --> 03:34.280]  She had a boyfriend and brought him, and he was from Brazil, and he called Aladdin, Aladdin.
[03:35.620 --> 03:38.120]  And so when I think of Aladdin, I think of how he said it, and it was fun.
[03:40.320 --> 03:41.040]  That's awesome.
[03:41.160 --> 03:47.340]  He was afraid to lose his hearing, so he wore those big headphones that you would wear if you worked at the airport.
[03:47.740 --> 03:48.840]  Oh, at the movie theater.
[03:49.340 --> 03:49.700]  Everywhere.
[03:50.080 --> 03:50.440]  Wow.
[03:50.640 --> 03:53.800]  I think that might have been an early sign of...
[03:53.800 --> 03:56.940]  It was the thing where we were like, oh, we didn't have autism when we grew up.
[03:57.060 --> 03:59.620]  Or that's like parental trauma passed on.
[03:59.680 --> 04:00.000]  Yes.
[04:00.180 --> 04:00.620]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:00.620 --> 04:02.420]  But, you know, it was the 90s.
[04:02.500 --> 04:03.500]  He was somewhere on the spectrum.
[04:03.680 --> 04:05.240]  Yeah, it was the 90s.
[04:05.280 --> 04:05.760]  Things were different.
[04:05.860 --> 04:07.120]  But, Geoff, what are we getting into first?
[04:07.320 --> 04:08.060]  Dude, I don't know.
[04:08.100 --> 04:10.040]  There's so much stuff to get into first.
[04:11.280 --> 04:12.800]  You didn't grab any mail, did you?
[04:13.020 --> 04:15.740]  We've been getting a lot of mail from y'all, and we really love it, by the way.
[04:15.800 --> 04:17.060]  Thank you so much for sending mail to us.
[04:17.080 --> 04:23.120]  If you want to send some cards for us to open up or some weird collectibles or oddities, maybe a picture of your dog.
[04:23.560 --> 04:24.500]  Which we love.
[04:25.580 --> 04:26.200]  For Christmas.
[04:26.320 --> 04:26.860]  Oh, and this.
[04:27.000 --> 04:28.520]  Go ahead and send it to... or that, yeah.
[04:28.600 --> 04:29.120]  Send it to...
[04:30.040 --> 04:30.740]  That's the same dog.
[04:31.220 --> 04:33.740]  1901 East 51st Street, Austin, Texas.
[04:35.060 --> 04:35.380]  78723.
[04:35.580 --> 04:36.900]  Care of... fuckface.
[04:37.240 --> 04:37.460]  Or...
[04:37.460 --> 04:37.620]  Break show.
[04:37.820 --> 04:38.240]  Break show.
[04:38.300 --> 04:38.560]  Care of break show.
[04:39.220 --> 04:40.300]  Don't write fuck on mail.
[04:40.540 --> 04:40.860]  Yeah.
[04:41.320 --> 04:42.100]  Care of break show.
[04:42.360 --> 04:43.340]  Send me Barbies, too.
[04:43.660 --> 04:44.060]  My Barbies.
[04:44.320 --> 04:45.080]  My collection's growing.
[04:45.080 --> 04:45.860]  Oh, we just asked for stuff.
[04:45.900 --> 04:46.600]  You can send me money.
[04:46.740 --> 04:47.020]  Oh, yeah.
[04:47.060 --> 04:47.920]  You can send me money.
[04:48.180 --> 04:48.880]  No, no, no.
[04:48.940 --> 04:49.700]  You said Barbies.
[04:49.940 --> 04:52.660]  Just go to Eric's Amazon wish list.
[04:53.460 --> 04:54.100]  Oh, yeah.
[04:54.180 --> 04:55.620]  I've never been smart enough to do that.
[04:56.240 --> 04:58.340]  I also don't show feet enough to do that, so.
[04:58.800 --> 04:59.960]  All right, what are we getting into?
[05:00.040 --> 05:01.080]  You want to show your...
[05:01.080 --> 05:01.500]  Let's get into some feet.
[05:01.800 --> 05:02.920]  Let's do last week's winners.
[05:02.980 --> 05:05.560]  I was going to say, let's get into that first and let's see how much money we made.
[05:05.620 --> 05:06.760]  All right, so here's how much money we made.
[05:06.880 --> 05:09.440]  I think you guys are going to be surprised with some of the results.
[05:09.680 --> 05:11.140]  Okay, so first card.
[05:11.380 --> 05:12.480]  You know, we opened up a lot of tops.
[05:12.780 --> 05:13.580]  All American Chrome.
[05:13.680 --> 05:15.140]  We're chasing those brawny odds, right?
[05:15.620 --> 05:21.280]  Well, we did get a McKenzie Mbacco, I think, autograph.
[05:21.720 --> 05:23.400]  This is, I think, is a basketball parallel.
[05:23.960 --> 05:25.620]  And it's numbered to 25.
[05:25.940 --> 05:27.440]  I'm going to say...
[05:27.440 --> 05:28.640]  High school player.
[05:29.420 --> 05:30.380]  12 bucks.
[05:30.620 --> 05:30.900]  Under.
[05:31.320 --> 05:32.360]  This one was $40.
[05:32.640 --> 05:33.060]  Wow!
[05:33.900 --> 05:35.020]  I was also surprised.
[05:36.180 --> 05:38.880]  You might remember Kaimora Johnson with the McDonald's parallel.
[05:39.080 --> 05:39.840]  I'd never seen before.
[05:40.040 --> 05:40.580]  You can kind of see...
[05:40.580 --> 05:41.560]  $12.
[05:42.460 --> 05:42.860]  Over.
[05:43.360 --> 05:43.780]  $2.
[05:44.340 --> 05:44.820]  Okay?
[05:45.440 --> 05:47.500]  This is Mookie Cook.
[05:47.760 --> 05:51.300]  Just a base, or just a refractor auto, silver refractor auto.
[05:52.880 --> 05:53.360]  $21.
[05:54.780 --> 05:55.260]  Under.
[05:55.460 --> 05:56.740]  It should have been Mookie Cook.
[05:57.080 --> 05:58.820]  Mookie Mookie Cook got...
[05:59.360 --> 05:59.800]  It's $5.
[06:00.220 --> 06:00.700]  Wow!
[06:01.040 --> 06:01.900]  We're signing everything.
[06:02.140 --> 06:03.800]  Now, this one might surprise you.
[06:04.860 --> 06:05.880]  You guys remember Breakouts?
[06:06.740 --> 06:07.700]  Chris Statlander?
[06:07.920 --> 06:09.260]  It was the one that was...
[06:09.260 --> 06:10.320]  The coolest card we've ever seen?
[06:10.320 --> 06:11.040]  The coolest card we've ever seen?
[06:11.220 --> 06:11.920]  I'm going to say $11.
[06:12.380 --> 06:12.580]  Over.
[06:13.240 --> 06:15.940]  That card runs for about $50 right now.
[06:16.040 --> 06:16.420]  Whoa!
[06:16.420 --> 06:18.220]  This is, I think, maybe a case hit.
[06:18.220 --> 06:18.740]  She's more than a woman.
[06:19.200 --> 06:19.800]  That's awesome!
[06:20.060 --> 06:24.100]  This card, you pull one of these about every 177 packs.
[06:24.140 --> 06:24.580]  Wow!
[06:24.840 --> 06:25.280]  Dang!
[06:25.840 --> 06:26.800]  Hey, somebody clip that.
[06:26.940 --> 06:28.580]  Let Chris Statlander know we have this.
[06:28.660 --> 06:28.780]  Yeah.
[06:29.180 --> 06:30.040]  So, these all...
[06:30.040 --> 06:32.340]  A bunch of these have already sold on eBay for like $50.
[06:32.720 --> 06:33.060]  Wow!
[06:33.120 --> 06:33.380]  Cool!
[06:33.380 --> 06:34.100]  Yeah, pretty cool.
[06:34.640 --> 06:36.860]  We got the extra auto that we weren't supposed to get.
[06:37.180 --> 06:38.940]  Andre Stokovich?
[06:39.060 --> 06:39.260]  $9.
[06:39.960 --> 06:40.400]  Over.
[06:40.760 --> 06:41.000]  $2.
[06:41.000 --> 06:41.360]  $3.
[06:41.360 --> 06:41.580]  Yeah.
[06:41.580 --> 06:42.780]  Okay, Chet Bass.
[06:43.140 --> 06:43.880]  The cheapest...
[06:43.880 --> 06:45.860]  Donner is the cheapest acceptable card you can buy.
[06:46.220 --> 06:48.020]  Chet Bass, probably going to win rookie of the year.
[06:48.100 --> 06:49.020]  This is last year's rookie card.
[06:49.140 --> 06:50.880]  Just to throw it out there, just to see what he...
[06:50.880 --> 06:52.820]  I'll say $6.50.
[06:53.020 --> 06:53.300]  Over.
[06:53.540 --> 06:53.880]  $3.
[06:54.900 --> 07:00.000]  Here we got Travis Etienne Jr., NFL debut rookie, blue...
[07:00.680 --> 07:02.140]  I don't remember what kind of parallel they got.
[07:02.440 --> 07:03.600]  Blue reactive parallel.
[07:04.000 --> 07:05.100]  I'm going to say...
[07:05.100 --> 07:06.220]  You know, $6.50 again.
[07:06.340 --> 07:07.660]  He's a huge running back.
[07:07.700 --> 07:07.820]  Yeah.
[07:08.040 --> 07:08.920]  Becoming a star.
[07:09.440 --> 07:10.400]  This was...
[07:11.280 --> 07:12.120]  This is fucking...
[07:12.840 --> 07:13.700]  A dollar.
[07:14.400 --> 07:14.880]  Nice.
[07:15.380 --> 07:15.780]  I knew it.
[07:15.880 --> 07:18.240]  Kyle Pitts, silver mosaic rookie.
[07:18.700 --> 07:21.180]  It's silver parallels the one you want when you're getting a rookie.
[07:21.300 --> 07:22.320]  Kyle Pitts, pretty good player.
[07:23.600 --> 07:24.300]  Everybody loves him.
[07:24.860 --> 07:25.340]  $2.
[07:26.080 --> 07:26.560]  Over.
[07:27.080 --> 07:27.560]  $1.
[07:27.840 --> 07:28.080]  God.
[07:28.080 --> 07:29.540]  I was really fucking disappointed with that one.
[07:29.880 --> 07:33.120]  And then last but not least, the brawny silver refractor.
[07:34.100 --> 07:35.860]  Not an auto, but it is a refractor.
[07:35.920 --> 07:36.360]  It is silver.
[07:36.860 --> 07:37.340]  $14.
[07:37.800 --> 07:38.040]  Over.
[07:38.460 --> 07:38.820]  $20.
[07:39.080 --> 07:40.480]  You should sell that right now.
[07:40.540 --> 07:41.460]  Probably should sell that right now.
[07:41.540 --> 07:42.120]  We're talking about that.
[07:42.180 --> 07:43.600]  We need to figure out how eBay works.
[07:43.800 --> 07:44.800]  Emily really wants to start selling stuff.
[07:44.880 --> 07:45.180]  Yeah.
[07:45.720 --> 07:47.860]  Let's get started with a cutie cuff.
[07:47.940 --> 07:48.420]  What do you say?
[07:48.560 --> 07:48.840]  Yeah.
[07:49.360 --> 07:51.160]  So this is one that I'm hoping to get Dumbo.
[07:51.320 --> 07:51.540]  Yeah.
[07:51.620 --> 07:52.200]  Because he's a cutie.
[07:52.300 --> 07:53.740]  Gracie, are you excited for the cutie cuffs?
[07:53.920 --> 07:54.080]  Yeah.
[07:54.300 --> 07:54.500]  Okay.
[07:54.760 --> 07:56.960]  Who would be the cutie that you would want from Disney?
[07:57.880 --> 07:58.340]  I don't know.
[07:58.520 --> 07:58.880]  Horse.
[07:59.180 --> 07:59.540]  Tigger.
[07:59.980 --> 08:00.340]  Dumbo.
[08:00.380 --> 08:01.020]  There's like a...
[08:01.740 --> 08:02.520]  Oh, hopefully.
[08:03.740 --> 08:04.540]  Ooh, a piglet.
[08:04.620 --> 08:05.700]  Oh, there's an Eeyore.
[08:08.340 --> 08:09.660]  If it's a poo, it's mine.
[08:10.620 --> 08:11.260]  Oh, fuck.
[08:11.320 --> 08:11.980]  It just pops right out.
[08:12.180 --> 08:13.000]  Oh, it's this guy.
[08:13.020 --> 08:13.900]  Ew, what the fuck is that?
[08:13.920 --> 08:15.240]  Oh, is that the big...
[08:15.240 --> 08:16.900]  Big hero number six guy.
[08:17.020 --> 08:17.760]  He's like a sloth.
[08:17.820 --> 08:18.460]  Oh, my God.
[08:18.520 --> 08:19.300]  You can get a Marie.
[08:19.960 --> 08:20.440]  There you go.
[08:20.760 --> 08:22.500]  I have to get the Marie from Aristocats.
[08:22.500 --> 08:22.580]  Watch this.
[08:22.820 --> 08:23.020]  Watch this.
[08:23.020 --> 08:23.580]  Hold it flat.
[08:23.840 --> 08:24.160]  Watch this.
[08:25.420 --> 08:25.740]  Watch this.
[08:25.880 --> 08:26.060]  Okay.
[08:26.840 --> 08:27.320]  Oh, shit.
[08:27.420 --> 08:27.660]  Oh, fuck.
[08:27.680 --> 08:28.020]  Hell, yeah.
[08:28.340 --> 08:30.000]  All right, Geoff, what are the possibilities you could get for...
[08:30.000 --> 08:31.500]  That dude's name is Baymax.
[08:32.060 --> 08:33.580]  Well, lay it flat so everyone can see.
[08:33.580 --> 08:35.680]  Yeah, so we could get Baymax, Bambi, Blizzard.
[08:35.680 --> 08:38.180]  Bullseye, Dumbo, Eeyore, Flounder.
[08:38.180 --> 08:38.900]  Oh, my God.
[08:39.100 --> 08:42.500]  Luau, Stitch, Marie, Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Olaf.
[08:42.600 --> 08:43.040]  What's the pig?
[08:43.520 --> 08:44.760]  Pascal, Pua.
[08:45.100 --> 08:45.860]  The pig's from...
[08:45.860 --> 08:46.700]  No, no, no, no.
[08:46.740 --> 08:47.560]  It's a different pig.
[08:47.980 --> 08:48.380]  From...
[08:48.380 --> 08:49.140]  Yeah, from Moana.
[08:49.420 --> 08:49.760]  Moana.
[08:49.800 --> 08:50.440]  But there's Pumba.
[08:50.800 --> 08:51.280]  That's cool.
[08:51.660 --> 08:52.320]  Pumba, Rafiki.
[08:52.660 --> 08:54.360]  You could get the tiger.
[08:54.560 --> 08:56.140]  I don't understand how there's no Apu.
[08:56.340 --> 08:57.000]  He's the monkey.
[08:57.240 --> 08:58.260]  It seems like he would be a thing.
[08:58.320 --> 08:59.100]  Well, he's not a cutie.
[08:59.300 --> 08:59.940]  Zomper, Stitch, Squirt.
[09:00.340 --> 09:01.340]  How is he not a cutie?
[09:01.380 --> 09:02.100]  What are you talking about?
[09:02.140 --> 09:02.720]  He's not a cutie.
[09:02.720 --> 09:05.640]  I don't know, but now I desperately have to have the Marie one.
[09:05.800 --> 09:07.040]  All right, well...
[09:07.040 --> 09:07.700]  If it's Frost, you'll get it.
[09:07.700 --> 09:08.300]  He's going to Target.
[09:08.780 --> 09:09.640]  Is Marie the white cat?
[09:09.840 --> 09:09.980]  Yeah.
[09:10.220 --> 09:11.520]  Yeah, she's a big fan of that cat.
[09:11.700 --> 09:11.880]  Yeah.
[09:12.200 --> 09:12.860]  Big damn fan.
[09:13.020 --> 09:13.220]  Yeah.
[09:13.580 --> 09:14.420]  You know what I did?
[09:14.780 --> 09:17.760]  People who wanted to be Rockabilly but couldn't quite get there.
[09:18.080 --> 09:18.560]  That's Marie?
[09:18.880 --> 09:19.960]  Yeah, they're fans of that cat.
[09:20.540 --> 09:21.300]  Oh, shit.
[09:21.460 --> 09:21.660]  Yeah.
[09:21.860 --> 09:22.340]  Think about it.
[09:22.340 --> 09:22.780]  I don't know.
[09:22.920 --> 09:23.360]  Think about it.
[09:23.460 --> 09:24.640]  I've never had baby bangs.
[09:24.880 --> 09:26.520]  No, but that's what I'm saying.
[09:26.640 --> 09:27.460]  You were close.
[09:27.860 --> 09:28.020]  But...
[09:28.020 --> 09:28.380]  You never...
[09:28.380 --> 09:28.980]  Yeah, mm-hmm.
[09:28.980 --> 09:35.140]  You were just one haircut away from going to Disneyland throwback days or whatever.
[09:35.360 --> 09:36.460]  Oh, God.
[09:37.280 --> 09:38.280]  Somebody sent in some mail.
[09:38.420 --> 09:39.260]  We got all jumbled up.
[09:39.660 --> 09:41.460]  And I don't know if I've read this on air or not.
[09:41.780 --> 09:42.780]  It's from Will from Portland.
[09:42.940 --> 09:43.920]  I'm pretty sure this is him.
[09:44.620 --> 09:46.380]  He sent a bunch of different stuff.
[09:46.440 --> 09:47.780]  He did some curation for us.
[09:47.800 --> 09:48.140]  Oh, that's fun.
[09:48.200 --> 09:48.820]  So I'm going to...
[09:48.820 --> 09:51.100]  This is two perfect fuckface cards, is what it says.
[09:51.100 --> 09:51.380]  Ooh.
[09:51.860 --> 09:52.180]  Okay.
[09:52.280 --> 09:53.460]  Let's open this up and see what they are.
[09:53.460 --> 09:54.560]  Oh, here we go.
[09:54.600 --> 09:55.060]  What's the first one?
[09:55.820 --> 09:56.920]  Right out the gate...
[09:56.920 --> 09:57.320]  Oh!
[09:58.560 --> 09:59.480]  Autographed on Zimba!
[09:59.480 --> 10:00.460]  We got an auto-Zim?
[10:01.300 --> 10:01.660]  Dang.
[10:01.980 --> 10:02.340]  Wow.
[10:03.060 --> 10:03.420]  Now...
[10:03.420 --> 10:03.660]  Oh!
[10:03.940 --> 10:04.520]  Ooh, who's that in the back?
[10:04.520 --> 10:05.580]  And then that's a Pedro Martinez...
[10:05.580 --> 10:05.980]  Pedro Martinez.
[10:06.280 --> 10:06.540]  Oh!
[10:06.600 --> 10:07.300]  They're fighting!
[10:08.000 --> 10:09.980]  Dude, it's Pitcher's Mount Dirt!
[10:10.120 --> 10:10.480]  Awesome.
[10:10.740 --> 10:11.220]  Look at that.
[10:11.300 --> 10:12.000]  Dude, they're fighting.
[10:12.340 --> 10:13.160]  They're connected.
[10:13.380 --> 10:14.100]  That's so cool.
[10:14.140 --> 10:16.360]  They can't sell that dirt outside of the United States.
[10:17.700 --> 10:18.740]  Fuck you, Australia.
[10:18.740 --> 10:19.600]  This is our dirt.
[10:19.780 --> 10:20.120]  Guess what?
[10:20.160 --> 10:21.560]  We can sell it in Canada now, baby.
[10:21.760 --> 10:23.320]  Dude, I think we have a...
[10:23.320 --> 10:24.460]  I need to get these authenticated.
[10:24.580 --> 10:24.740]  Yeah.
[10:24.940 --> 10:25.460]  For sure.
[10:25.640 --> 10:26.460]  I'm going to just...
[10:26.460 --> 10:27.080]  I know we're going to do it.
[10:27.080 --> 10:28.020]  You're going to...
[10:28.020 --> 10:28.720]  Ding with it.
[10:28.940 --> 10:29.680]  Did you not pick...
[10:29.680 --> 10:30.120]  Great, man.
[10:30.300 --> 10:30.800]  You got pockets.
[10:31.100 --> 10:31.560]  Oh, there you go.
[10:32.000 --> 10:32.880]  I'm just going to put that right there.
[10:33.060 --> 10:33.380]  Awesome.
[10:33.900 --> 10:34.780]  Oh, it looks so good.
[10:35.100 --> 10:36.040]  It's our first...
[10:36.640 --> 10:37.280]  First card.
[10:37.480 --> 10:39.560]  The light's hitting it so hard you can't see what it is.
[10:39.720 --> 10:41.180]  That shit rocks, baby.
[10:41.300 --> 10:42.260]  That's what it's going to be like.
[10:42.400 --> 10:42.740]  But that's okay.
[10:42.960 --> 10:43.120]  Wow.
[10:44.000 --> 10:44.560]  Look at that.
[10:45.120 --> 10:46.020]  And there's one more.
[10:46.060 --> 10:46.940]  It's in there, in the night.
[10:47.360 --> 10:48.360]  Special for Geoff.
[10:48.400 --> 10:48.700]  Okay.
[10:48.840 --> 10:50.040]  Oh, we'll see about that.
[10:51.040 --> 10:51.360]  Oh.
[10:52.970 --> 10:53.290]  Oh.
[10:53.710 --> 10:54.130]  What'd you get?
[10:54.190 --> 10:54.510]  Oh.
[10:55.070 --> 10:55.490]  What'd you get?
[10:55.490 --> 10:56.030]  What'd you get, bud?
[10:56.030 --> 10:57.330]  There's a Marcus Smart on it.
[10:57.330 --> 10:57.790]  Oh, wow.
[10:58.230 --> 10:58.930]  It's a Celtic card.
[10:59.230 --> 11:00.470]  It's a...
[11:01.650 --> 11:02.590]  It's not a...
[11:02.590 --> 11:02.970]  Is it?
[11:05.330 --> 11:07.390]  Oh, it's numbered to 200.
[11:07.630 --> 11:08.170]  Oh, wow.
[11:08.410 --> 11:08.930]  It's a...
[11:08.930 --> 11:10.130]  It's a patch auto...
[11:10.130 --> 11:11.410]  Do you have anything like this?
[11:11.470 --> 11:12.090]  ...from NBA Courtside.
[11:12.210 --> 11:13.390]  I don't have this one.
[11:13.410 --> 11:13.670]  Yeah.
[11:13.990 --> 11:15.430]  Yeah, this is really...
[11:15.430 --> 11:15.630]  Oh.
[11:16.030 --> 11:17.230]  That's so cool.
[11:17.330 --> 11:18.550]  Is it Will from Portland?
[11:18.730 --> 11:18.950]  Is that what it is?
[11:19.110 --> 11:19.550]  Wow.
[11:20.030 --> 11:20.470]  Wow.
[11:20.690 --> 11:22.810]  And he just had made his return to Boston.
[11:22.810 --> 11:23.990]  I saw that.
[11:24.090 --> 11:24.750]  That was so hard.
[11:24.910 --> 11:25.610]  I know.
[11:25.610 --> 11:27.630]  I cried a little bit last night.
[11:27.650 --> 11:30.550]  You stood up and clapped with the audience whenever they were playing the video.
[11:30.770 --> 11:31.690]  She's not even kidding.
[11:31.850 --> 11:34.090]  I was sitting on the sofa, and then they played the...
[11:34.090 --> 11:38.350]  In the first quarter at a commercial break, they played the, you know, the...
[11:38.350 --> 11:39.070]  Welcome home kind of thing.
[11:39.090 --> 11:40.130]  ...the welcome home video to Marcus Smart.
[11:40.130 --> 11:40.830]  That's so nice.
[11:40.910 --> 11:42.450]  And it was probably the best one I've ever seen.
[11:42.730 --> 11:43.490]  And I was...
[11:43.490 --> 11:44.650]  I was brought to my feet.
[11:44.830 --> 11:47.310]  They were choked up and just...
[11:47.310 --> 11:48.110]  It's beautiful.
[11:48.370 --> 11:49.190]  I love him so much.
[11:49.210 --> 11:50.350]  And I love you, Will, from Portland.
[11:50.470 --> 11:51.350]  Thank you so much for this.
[11:51.350 --> 11:52.070]  That's a good card.
[11:52.110 --> 11:52.670]  This means a lot.
[11:52.690 --> 11:52.810]  Yeah.
[11:53.110 --> 11:54.050]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[11:54.050 --> 11:55.650]  Sketches and swatches.
[11:56.010 --> 11:56.030]  Yeah.
[11:56.190 --> 11:56.710]  Do you want to kiss it?
[11:57.010 --> 11:57.970]  The, uh...
[11:57.970 --> 12:00.130]  You teared up watching Marcus Smart come back, did you?
[12:00.270 --> 12:02.810]  I teared up watching Joker pump fake.
[12:08.790 --> 12:09.270]  That...
[12:09.270 --> 12:10.530]  I've watched that highlight.
[12:10.670 --> 12:11.270]  Oh, dude.
[12:11.970 --> 12:14.210]  Aiden is just...
[12:15.130 --> 12:16.870]  He watches it happen.
[12:17.270 --> 12:18.750]  He puts a hand up.
[12:19.350 --> 12:23.510]  So if you have not seen this highlight, Jokic is going for a shot.
[12:23.510 --> 12:27.930]  He pump fakes so hard that DeAndre Aiden just puts a hand up and then watches where the
[12:27.930 --> 12:31.430]  ball is supposed to be and just gets run by.
[12:31.770 --> 12:32.910]  And it's like, how...
[12:32.910 --> 12:33.450]  Are you new?
[12:33.930 --> 12:35.490]  Like, is this your first day?
[12:35.650 --> 12:36.190]  What happened?
[12:36.570 --> 12:37.030]  That was rough.
[12:37.270 --> 12:37.830]  It was pretty good.
[12:38.510 --> 12:45.070]  In honor of the Super Bowl, Super Game, Big Games, Big Bowl, Big Bowl, we're gonna open
[12:45.070 --> 12:47.670]  up probably last year's Mosaic Hangar Pack.
[12:48.510 --> 12:49.370]  Yeah, it was pretty embarrassing.
[12:49.750 --> 12:50.410]  It was pretty cool.
[12:50.470 --> 12:51.130]  It was pretty cool.
[12:51.230 --> 12:51.730]  I love it.
[12:51.730 --> 12:53.690]  And I actually like DeAndre Aiden.
[12:53.850 --> 12:58.290]  I was one of the people that thought that he just needed a change of scenery, but that
[12:58.290 --> 12:58.970]  does not seem to be the case.
[12:58.970 --> 13:00.930]  No, I think he's a fine guy.
[13:01.090 --> 13:03.670]  You know, NBA is the best it's ever been probably right now in terms of talent.
[13:03.810 --> 13:04.270]  Pretty good.
[13:04.810 --> 13:05.230]  Easily.
[13:05.390 --> 13:08.930]  You don't often see a highlight like that that makes you go, ah, out loud.
[13:10.510 --> 13:15.470]  Second year Jamar Chase card, Kyler Murray, Kyla, Larry Johnson.
[13:16.490 --> 13:18.050]  My dad's name was Larry.
[13:18.670 --> 13:19.010]  Aw.
[13:19.150 --> 13:19.870]  Not Johnson.
[13:20.330 --> 13:20.770]  Ramsey.
[13:20.770 --> 13:21.370]  Yeah.
[13:21.790 --> 13:22.730]  It's because of my name.
[13:23.050 --> 13:23.190]  Yeah.
[13:23.490 --> 13:24.690]  Bryce Young rookie.
[13:24.870 --> 13:26.030]  Boy, that could have been worth something.
[13:27.390 --> 13:27.990]  Joe Montana.
[13:27.990 --> 13:28.810]  What's wrong with him?
[13:28.930 --> 13:29.210]  What happened?
[13:29.310 --> 13:29.550]  Tyler Scott.
[13:29.650 --> 13:30.250]  He had a rough year.
[13:30.370 --> 13:31.370]  He went 2-15.
[13:31.850 --> 13:32.510]  Here's what happened.
[13:32.710 --> 13:32.810]  No.
[13:32.890 --> 13:33.170]  Jalen Hyatt.
[13:33.170 --> 13:34.210]  Was he the one from Alabama?
[13:34.550 --> 13:34.870]  Yeah.
[13:35.010 --> 13:35.570]  Still is.
[13:35.670 --> 13:36.010]  Salt.
[13:38.190 --> 13:39.410]  Well, we're about to now.
[13:39.430 --> 13:41.050]  Do you want me to slave these?
[13:41.050 --> 13:41.430]  Yeah.
[13:41.590 --> 13:42.650]  Joey Porter Jr.
[13:44.710 --> 13:45.110]  Refract.
[13:45.210 --> 13:46.070]  Whatever the fuck it is.
[13:46.770 --> 13:47.410]  Ryan Tannehill.
[13:47.650 --> 13:47.970]  Green.
[13:50.010 --> 13:50.330]  Pink.
[13:50.550 --> 13:50.870]  Prism.
[13:51.630 --> 13:52.270]  Christian McCaffrey.
[13:52.450 --> 13:52.970]  Hey, all right.
[13:53.210 --> 13:55.410]  I mean, that's probably not worth anything, but that's cool.
[13:55.550 --> 13:58.190]  So is Nick Saban retiring or is he going to go do something else?
[13:58.210 --> 13:58.970]  I think he's retiring.
[13:59.290 --> 13:59.510]  Yeah.
[14:01.270 --> 14:01.590]  What?
[14:01.750 --> 14:02.570]  What's going on with you?
[14:03.090 --> 14:03.730]  Michael Wilson.
[14:03.790 --> 14:06.010]  You know, I wasn't going to say anything, but Geoff's in a bad mood.
[14:06.050 --> 14:06.450]  You can tell.
[14:06.750 --> 14:07.250]  I'm not.
[14:07.270 --> 14:08.090]  And how silly you are.
[14:08.090 --> 14:10.370]  I got all sad about the Nick Saban stuff.
[14:10.610 --> 14:11.310]  What a bummer.
[14:11.430 --> 14:12.170]  And the Marcus Smart.
[14:12.350 --> 14:13.370]  You guys are hitting me hard.
[14:13.570 --> 14:15.530]  You guys are going to hit me right in my sports feels.
[14:15.530 --> 14:17.350]  And Aiden just got that pump big.
[14:20.050 --> 14:21.830]  Here's a big head of A.J. Brown.
[14:21.990 --> 14:24.790]  That's the worst card I've ever seen.
[14:24.950 --> 14:26.290]  That sucks shit.
[14:26.510 --> 14:27.810]  Why did they make that?
[14:28.410 --> 14:29.590]  Why did they do that?
[14:29.610 --> 14:31.070]  Here's a big head of Travis Kelce.
[14:31.430 --> 14:32.570]  Wait, wait, wait.
[14:32.610 --> 14:33.310]  Keep that on there.
[14:33.450 --> 14:34.450]  Why did they make that?
[14:34.470 --> 14:34.690]  Why?
[14:34.770 --> 14:35.650]  They look like little kids.
[14:35.950 --> 14:38.070]  It's like NBA Jam big head mode.
[14:38.130 --> 14:39.110]  Yeah, that sucks.
[14:39.250 --> 14:40.290]  They do it for basketball too.
[14:41.790 --> 14:43.430]  That looks like Little League.
[14:43.650 --> 14:44.230]  What a bad idea.
[14:45.290 --> 14:45.510]  Yuck.
[14:47.790 --> 14:51.050]  Let's open up some 2022 NFL mosaic.
[14:51.270 --> 14:53.770]  Maybe we'll get the fucking Brock Purdy.
[14:53.910 --> 14:54.990]  What are you doing?
[14:55.490 --> 14:57.850]  I had a cookie earlier and I didn't want it anymore.
[14:57.950 --> 14:59.350]  And it was taking up real estate.
[14:59.950 --> 15:03.610]  And so I had to put it over there.
[15:05.130 --> 15:06.330]  Taking up real estate?
[15:06.590 --> 15:06.770]  Yeah.
[15:06.890 --> 15:07.990]  I don't have much, you know.
[15:08.130 --> 15:10.390]  I've got our photo from the Ramseys.
[15:10.510 --> 15:10.950]  I understand.
[15:11.410 --> 15:13.650]  Now, are you just in a good silly day mood?
[15:13.650 --> 15:18.990]  Or are you in a, my life is in such a toilet that I can't help but laugh?
[15:19.070 --> 15:19.670]  No, it's fine.
[15:19.710 --> 15:20.870]  I think today was fine.
[15:21.630 --> 15:25.110]  Got some good news about Fuckface and where we're at and what we're doing.
[15:25.230 --> 15:25.730]  So it's good.
[15:25.830 --> 15:26.610]  Did I get that news?
[15:27.370 --> 15:28.470]  I don't care if you got that news.
[15:28.650 --> 15:29.590]  Well, I'd like to know.
[15:29.690 --> 15:30.230]  Nah, you're fine.
[15:30.310 --> 15:30.910]  Can you tell us?
[15:30.930 --> 15:33.570]  I mean, don't tell us on camera, but I want to know the good news.
[15:33.810 --> 15:34.630]  Nah, don't worry about it.
[15:35.250 --> 15:36.350]  But it's my show.
[15:36.630 --> 15:37.270]  It's our show.
[15:37.810 --> 15:40.410]  I mean, it is, but I created it.
[15:40.410 --> 15:43.950]  Is it that Does It Do, which is out now everywhere, is doing really well?
[15:44.030 --> 15:45.430]  That might be part of it.
[15:45.530 --> 15:47.630]  Oh, dude, Does It Do Season 2 is out.
[15:47.930 --> 15:49.430]  Episode 2 came out today.
[15:49.610 --> 15:50.730]  The top pick.
[15:50.990 --> 15:51.990]  Boy, your eyebrows.
[15:52.390 --> 15:52.870]  So good.
[15:52.990 --> 15:54.130]  People fucking love that shit.
[15:54.250 --> 15:54.910]  It's becoming viral.
[15:56.050 --> 15:57.090]  It's pretty good.
[15:57.130 --> 16:00.890]  And I'd like to point out, too, in that they do like a little trailer where it talks about
[16:00.890 --> 16:02.450]  how I rubbed my eyebrows away.
[16:02.690 --> 16:03.530]  That's literally what happened.
[16:03.530 --> 16:03.610]  You did.
[16:03.890 --> 16:04.850]  It's my form of stress.
[16:04.890 --> 16:06.050]  You'll see me do it all the time.
[16:06.130 --> 16:09.150]  If you go back and look at any old Rooster Teeth video, I'm doing this constantly.
[16:09.150 --> 16:10.590]  I just rub them off.
[16:10.650 --> 16:11.010]  Yeah.
[16:11.030 --> 16:11.870]  Yeah, that sucks.
[16:11.990 --> 16:12.830]  Well, that's why...
[16:12.830 --> 16:15.010]  Michael Gavin.
[16:15.190 --> 16:15.970]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[16:16.230 --> 16:16.950]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[16:16.950 --> 16:17.350]  I'm getting that.
[16:17.390 --> 16:18.390]  I get that with Gavin a little bit.
[16:18.430 --> 16:18.730]  It's right here.
[16:18.870 --> 16:19.490]  It'll happen.
[16:19.650 --> 16:19.910]  I get it.
[16:20.230 --> 16:20.710]  It's impossible.
[16:21.390 --> 16:25.210]  Anyway, go to YouTube or go to the Rooster Teeth website.
[16:25.590 --> 16:26.430]  The Rooster Teeth website.
[16:26.530 --> 16:27.830]  Go to fuckfacepod.com.
[16:27.850 --> 16:29.030]  Go to fuckfacepod.com.
[16:29.270 --> 16:30.110]  Go to the app.
[16:30.410 --> 16:33.010]  Just watch Season 2 of Does It Do?
[16:33.170 --> 16:33.330]  Yeah.
[16:33.490 --> 16:34.450]  Sponsored by Shady Rays.
[16:34.650 --> 16:38.130]  It would have been first show, but they sponsored it so everybody could see it.
[16:38.170 --> 16:39.130]  So everybody should see it.
[16:39.130 --> 16:40.330]  There's 8 billion of you.
[16:40.410 --> 16:41.290]  I have a view counter.
[16:41.630 --> 16:44.910]  I know how many of the 8 billion of you aren't watching the fucking video.
[16:45.190 --> 16:46.830]  And you will be hearing from me.
[16:46.990 --> 16:49.550]  They should see it through their Shady Ray sunglasses.
[16:49.590 --> 16:50.050]  That's pretty good.
[16:50.170 --> 16:51.670]  You know what else they should watch?
[16:51.810 --> 16:51.990]  Uh-huh.
[16:52.190 --> 16:58.290]  They should watch the desk rays between Gracie and Gavin to see what happened.
[16:58.390 --> 16:59.110]  To see who was right.
[16:59.310 --> 17:01.230]  Yeah, we finally settled the score on that.
[17:02.290 --> 17:04.970]  That's a bit that started on this show.
[17:04.990 --> 17:05.550]  Yeah, yeah.
[17:05.550 --> 17:05.890]  Right here.
[17:06.390 --> 17:08.970]  There's a culmination also available right now.
[17:08.970 --> 17:13.390]  So much supplemental content going on over in Fuckface World.
[17:13.510 --> 17:14.630]  So much content in general.
[17:14.910 --> 17:16.930]  Eric and I, you know, we do this other podcast, ANMA.
[17:17.270 --> 17:17.670]  ANMA?
[17:17.950 --> 17:18.890]  What does that stand for?
[17:19.850 --> 17:20.810]  Anarchy Me Anything.
[17:21.230 --> 17:23.630]  And you can find out more at AnarchyMeAnything.com.
[17:23.750 --> 17:24.750]  Scroll all the way to the bottom.
[17:25.110 --> 17:26.430]  Leave a note in the guestbook.
[17:26.550 --> 17:29.190]  And check out the hit counter that Gus just added.
[17:29.270 --> 17:31.370]  So you can see how many people who have been to our website.
[17:31.950 --> 17:35.050]  We also put certified gold standard website money.
[17:35.090 --> 17:35.830]  Oh my god.
[17:37.070 --> 17:37.810]  That's so awesome.
[17:38.570 --> 17:41.210]  Every once in a while, Gus fucks off and doesn't do the podcast.
[17:41.310 --> 17:42.330]  And then Eric and I get to have fun.
[17:42.530 --> 17:44.850]  So this week and next week, we got some fun stuff.
[17:44.930 --> 17:45.570]  We're talking about music.
[17:45.850 --> 17:46.730]  We did a little field trip.
[17:46.770 --> 17:48.970]  The one that we have next week will be like a lot of fun.
[17:49.030 --> 17:49.830]  It was a good experiment.
[17:50.170 --> 17:51.010]  It did an experiment.
[17:51.190 --> 17:51.470]  There you go.
[17:52.690 --> 17:53.570]  Yeah, there's so much.
[17:53.730 --> 17:57.450]  Also, the Clutch My Pearls podcast with your wife and my wife where they get together.
[17:57.830 --> 18:02.070]  And then they talk about how people diddle each other in a sensual way.
[18:02.730 --> 18:04.390]  The episode's coming out tomorrow.
[18:04.870 --> 18:06.930]  Or if you're watching this on Thursday, it's already out.
[18:06.970 --> 18:07.790]  So you should go watch it.
[18:07.790 --> 18:10.130]  Oh, you might be able to watch it on YouTube.
[18:10.370 --> 18:12.090]  But you should also download it because we need the counts.
[18:12.710 --> 18:15.090]  This is where we talk about the two Ps and the V.
[18:16.030 --> 18:16.910]  Double penetration?
[18:17.470 --> 18:18.430]  Jesus fucking Christ.
[18:19.110 --> 18:20.870]  This is a baseball card show.
[18:21.090 --> 18:22.530]  Yeah, but it's a hockey book.
[18:23.770 --> 18:25.010]  They're hockey players.
[18:25.390 --> 18:25.590]  Hello.
[18:25.910 --> 18:27.430]  She's a sports therapist.
[18:27.890 --> 18:28.550]  Oh my god.
[18:29.090 --> 18:29.930]  So there's that.
[18:30.130 --> 18:30.750]  There's also...
[18:30.750 --> 18:31.170]  I do a podcast...
[18:31.170 --> 18:35.550]  I do a podcast all about myself that's super clean and family friendly.
[18:35.630 --> 18:36.670]  It doesn't have any of that nonsense.
[18:37.270 --> 18:38.190]  It's so alright.
[18:38.270 --> 18:39.630]  You can check that if you want to.
[18:39.710 --> 18:40.150]  You don't have to.
[18:40.170 --> 18:40.610]  I don't give a fuck.
[18:40.870 --> 18:43.750]  Just set it to automatically download, at least.
[18:44.370 --> 18:45.110]  Trent Williams.
[18:46.170 --> 18:46.970]  Roger Staubach.
[18:47.930 --> 18:48.730]  Carson Witts.
[18:49.190 --> 18:49.990]  Elijah Moore.
[18:50.370 --> 18:51.090]  Josh Allen.
[18:51.210 --> 18:52.110]  That was a dog shit pack.
[18:52.190 --> 18:53.610]  Can I be honest about these football cards?
[18:53.850 --> 18:54.070]  Yeah.
[18:54.130 --> 18:54.830]  I don't like these cards.
[18:55.130 --> 18:56.710]  You don't like Mosaic or you just don't like football cards?
[18:56.710 --> 18:58.310]  I don't think they're interesting looking.
[18:58.810 --> 19:00.810]  And I don't think that there's like...
[19:00.810 --> 19:01.310]  There's too many.
[19:01.930 --> 19:02.730]  DeForest Buckner.
[19:03.110 --> 19:03.790]  Rashad Bateman.
[19:03.790 --> 19:05.370]  I don't have a problem with football players.
[19:05.370 --> 19:06.850]  I just think these cards suck.
[19:06.930 --> 19:07.370]  Daniel Jones.
[19:07.530 --> 19:08.610]  Yeah, they're not...
[19:08.610 --> 19:09.330]  They're not the best ever.
[19:09.430 --> 19:10.070]  I'll tell you what we'll do.
[19:10.170 --> 19:10.870]  We'll just get through...
[19:10.870 --> 19:11.730]  How about we get through...
[19:11.730 --> 19:12.870]  You know what we should do is we should...
[19:12.870 --> 19:13.750]  Feed the Pac-Sac?
[19:13.950 --> 19:16.030]  I fucking love the Pac-Sac in the office.
[19:16.170 --> 19:16.410]  Hey, where's the Pac-Sac, buddy?
[19:17.270 --> 19:18.350]  I'll put these in later.
[19:18.510 --> 19:18.710]  Wow.
[19:18.710 --> 19:19.770]  You can put them in my briefcase.
[19:20.530 --> 19:21.230]  I really fucked...
[19:21.230 --> 19:22.750]  I really dropped the Pac-Sac ball.
[19:23.170 --> 19:24.130]  I knew I was forgetting something.
[19:26.210 --> 19:27.390]  Do you want floor cookie?
[19:28.010 --> 19:28.330]  No.
[19:29.930 --> 19:30.830]  Don't eat your feelings.
[19:30.950 --> 19:31.370]  Come on, man.
[19:31.650 --> 19:32.330]  I'm gonna put him in here.
[19:32.810 --> 19:33.130]  Kirby...
[19:33.130 --> 19:34.010]  Can he pick it?
[19:34.270 --> 19:34.530]  Uh-huh.
[19:34.810 --> 19:35.350]  DJ Moore.
[19:35.970 --> 19:36.850]  Darius Leonard.
[19:37.110 --> 19:38.070]  Alan Robinson.
[19:38.270 --> 19:38.650]  Ooh.
[19:38.850 --> 19:42.170]  Here's a silver paramil of Louis Sinay.
[19:42.490 --> 19:44.290]  That looks like a basketball card.
[19:44.350 --> 19:44.930]  That's a cool...
[19:44.930 --> 19:48.230]  Do you think that if the cards looked more like that, like they weren't in their gear?
[19:48.790 --> 19:48.990]  No, no.
[19:49.150 --> 19:49.670]  They're just all...
[19:49.670 --> 19:51.490]  It's the background and everything of it.
[19:51.570 --> 19:52.090]  It's just like...
[19:52.890 --> 19:56.030]  Here's a PNG of a guy on top of like a crazy...
[19:56.030 --> 19:56.890]  It just...
[19:56.890 --> 19:57.330]  He's not into it.
[19:57.390 --> 19:57.910]  It's not interesting.
[19:58.190 --> 19:58.970]  Tony Buscelli.
[19:59.230 --> 19:59.390]  Yeah.
[19:59.610 --> 20:00.210]  Derrick Henry.
[20:00.450 --> 20:00.770]  Alabama.
[20:01.630 --> 20:02.510]  Trey Hendrickson.
[20:02.690 --> 20:03.590]  Damien Harris.
[20:04.390 --> 20:05.270]  Roger McCreary.
[20:06.090 --> 20:07.230]  And a...
[20:07.230 --> 20:08.290]  Jameson Williams!
[20:09.930 --> 20:10.510]  That might be decent.
[20:11.170 --> 20:11.710]  That's cool.
[20:12.090 --> 20:12.490]  I like that.
[20:13.090 --> 20:13.550]  All right.
[20:13.650 --> 20:14.070]  Fuck them.
[20:14.270 --> 20:15.270]  We don't want those cards anymore.
[20:15.730 --> 20:15.850]  Yeah.
[20:15.990 --> 20:16.390]  Hell yeah.
[20:16.630 --> 20:17.330]  We got some time.
[20:17.750 --> 20:19.970]  Emily requested that we open up some Alan and Ginter.
[20:20.410 --> 20:27.210]  Shout out to the complaint department on Reddit who started assembling the troops to reach
[20:27.210 --> 20:31.450]  out to T.O.P.S. and to demand a Geoff Ramsey card.
[20:31.490 --> 20:31.950]  It's true.
[20:32.070 --> 20:32.570]  They have.
[20:32.710 --> 20:33.190]  I've seen it.
[20:33.450 --> 20:34.270]  That's never gonna happen.
[20:34.730 --> 20:35.310]  Please, please.
[20:35.810 --> 20:40.530]  Just let them, instead of saying, he has this podcast called Fuckface, just say, he started
[20:41.070 --> 20:42.690]  Rooster Teeth and Red vs. Blue.
[20:42.910 --> 20:44.730]  You guys are going about it in a weird way.
[20:44.950 --> 20:45.350]  Oh, guys.
[20:45.450 --> 20:45.870]  That's all.
[20:46.170 --> 20:46.990]  Did we get a top loader?
[20:47.050 --> 20:47.390]  Nah.
[20:47.690 --> 20:48.010]  What'd we get?
[20:48.030 --> 20:52.650]  We didn't get a top loader ripper, but we did get a rip card.
[20:52.850 --> 20:53.210]  Yay!
[20:53.210 --> 20:54.610]  I think we got a single rip card.
[20:54.710 --> 20:56.270]  Are we gonna save that for the end or are you gonna do it right now?
[20:57.310 --> 20:58.750]  I don't know what this is.
[21:00.110 --> 21:01.830]  One N43 box loader card inside.
[21:01.910 --> 21:02.970]  I wanna open this right now.
[21:03.030 --> 21:03.170]  Do it.
[21:03.230 --> 21:04.550]  I don't think this is a rip card.
[21:04.550 --> 21:05.990]  I don't know what this is.
[21:06.110 --> 21:08.310]  I've never seen a small box loader.
[21:08.310 --> 21:08.410]  Okay.
[21:08.570 --> 21:08.910]  Oh.
[21:09.030 --> 21:09.790]  What is it?
[21:11.710 --> 21:12.410]  What's that?
[21:12.510 --> 21:14.590]  It's like a little Hank Aaron box loader card.
[21:15.030 --> 21:16.310]  He's a good player, right?
[21:17.750 --> 21:19.230]  Yeah, I've never seen these before.
[21:19.910 --> 21:21.170]  I don't understand what it is.
[21:21.250 --> 21:22.810]  It's a baseball card on a baseball card.
[21:22.930 --> 21:24.130]  It's the box loader, they call it.
[21:24.150 --> 21:25.070]  You keep saying it.
[21:25.150 --> 21:27.590]  It's just a picture of a baseball card on a baseball card.
[21:27.710 --> 21:29.010]  I'm aware of that, dude.
[21:29.250 --> 21:29.630]  It's just...
[21:29.630 --> 21:29.670]  Wow.
[21:30.030 --> 21:31.010]  See that attitude?
[21:31.310 --> 21:31.330]  Yeah, right?
[21:31.350 --> 21:32.870]  I mean, I don't know.
[21:32.870 --> 21:33.650]  I didn't make it.
[21:33.910 --> 21:35.110]  Yeah, but is there any...
[21:35.110 --> 21:37.090]  I'm also disappointed with that card.
[21:37.410 --> 21:39.130]  I also don't think that card is cool.
[21:39.290 --> 21:41.090]  If Gavin was here, he wouldn't have talked to Gavin that way.
[21:41.270 --> 21:41.430]  No.
[21:41.790 --> 21:42.870]  Oh, I would easily...
[21:42.870 --> 21:44.610]  I would shit in his mouth on camera.
[21:44.610 --> 21:46.950]  He wouldn't be able to talk that way because he'd be too like...
[21:50.170 --> 21:54.450]  Sounds like two people are jealous of me and Gavin sucking each other.
[21:55.750 --> 21:57.270]  This really isn't anything.
[21:57.630 --> 21:58.290]  Lopez, Cortez...
[21:58.290 --> 21:58.690]  It's not.
[21:58.950 --> 22:00.090]  Willie Mays looking...
[22:00.090 --> 22:00.790]  Crazy eyes.
[22:00.990 --> 22:01.230]  Mm-hmm.
[22:01.230 --> 22:02.230]  Dylan Cease...
[22:05.210 --> 22:06.010]  Andres Jimenez...
[22:06.010 --> 22:08.470]  Oh, Charlie Blackmon, but it's an Allen and Ginter back.
[22:08.930 --> 22:09.590]  That is a parallel.
[22:09.730 --> 22:10.150]  That's nice.
[22:10.290 --> 22:11.630]  I respect Charlie Blackmon as a player.
[22:11.810 --> 22:14.330]  He plays in the NL West, and I have to see him so many times in a fucking year.
[22:14.450 --> 22:16.030]  I hate Charlie Blackmon so goddamn much.
[22:16.030 --> 22:16.450]  Fuck that guy.
[22:16.650 --> 22:17.110]  Hate him.
[22:17.250 --> 22:17.910]  And a violin.
[22:17.970 --> 22:18.450]  And a violin!
[22:19.930 --> 22:20.770]  Let's open up another.
[22:20.950 --> 22:26.970]  Did you see the Kansas City Royals are like the biggest luxury tax in the AL Central?
[22:27.210 --> 22:28.170]  Kansas City Royals?
[22:28.190 --> 22:30.250]  They signed Bobby Witt Jr. to like a big-ass contract.
[22:30.250 --> 22:31.150]  Luxury tax.
[22:31.150 --> 22:31.950]  It's a pretty big fucking contract.
[22:32.210 --> 22:33.290]  It is very big.
[22:33.570 --> 22:33.870]  Very big.
[22:34.430 --> 22:34.610]  Don't worry.
[22:34.810 --> 22:35.270]  Shouhei Otani big?
[22:35.610 --> 22:36.630]  No, not quite.
[22:36.770 --> 22:39.690]  But those, you know, the small market white socks, hopefully they can catch up this year.
[22:40.110 --> 22:41.010]  John DiMaggio.
[22:41.350 --> 22:41.850]  Who's that?
[22:42.210 --> 22:42.550]  The guy.
[22:42.870 --> 22:43.150]  The Bender.
[22:43.390 --> 22:44.010]  Is this Bender?
[22:44.190 --> 22:45.510]  Bender from Futurama.
[22:45.510 --> 22:51.190]  Oh, and you did the voice on Red vs. Blue, which is one of the longest-running animated series.
[22:51.430 --> 22:51.870]  Check this out.
[22:51.990 --> 22:52.150]  Yeah.
[22:52.530 --> 22:53.370]  What's my character's name?
[22:53.730 --> 22:54.010]  Griff.
[22:54.270 --> 22:54.830]  Oh, fuck!
[22:54.930 --> 22:55.210]  You got it.
[22:55.370 --> 22:56.150]  That was pretty impressive.
[22:56.370 --> 22:57.890]  You don't think that I would remember that?
[22:58.290 --> 22:58.610]  No.
[22:59.450 --> 23:00.070]  Absolutely not.
[23:00.210 --> 23:01.250]  I work here, and I hardly know that.
[23:01.250 --> 23:02.070]  Because I didn't say Dickhead?
[23:02.230 --> 23:02.370]  Yeah.
[23:04.090 --> 23:04.690]  What is...
[23:04.690 --> 23:05.530]  All right, let me get to that in a second.
[23:06.490 --> 23:07.430]  Vladimir Guerrero Jr.
[23:07.870 --> 23:09.590]  He's on the cover of the next MLB game.
[23:09.610 --> 23:10.050]  Brandon Nemo.
[23:10.250 --> 23:10.590]  Is he really?
[23:10.670 --> 23:10.830]  Yeah.
[23:10.950 --> 23:11.590]  Oh, that's a good smile.
[23:11.850 --> 23:12.970]  Ari Chambers.
[23:13.530 --> 23:13.990]  Who's that?
[23:14.050 --> 23:14.670]  A basketball reporter.
[23:16.230 --> 23:16.870]  Yachty Ermelina.
[23:17.610 --> 23:17.930]  Yachty.
[23:18.870 --> 23:19.510]  Justin Turner.
[23:20.170 --> 23:21.090]  Plays for the Red Sox.
[23:21.190 --> 23:21.670]  No, he doesn't.
[23:21.730 --> 23:22.010]  He goes...
[23:22.010 --> 23:22.450]  Oh, right.
[23:22.650 --> 23:23.550]  He's like somewhere else.
[23:23.770 --> 23:24.550]  Toronto, I think.
[23:25.410 --> 23:25.930]  One-year deal.
[23:25.930 --> 23:27.070]  Red Kite Fal...
[23:27.070 --> 23:27.590]  Uh...
[23:27.590 --> 23:27.970]  What?
[23:27.990 --> 23:28.150]  No!
[23:29.330 --> 23:30.350]  Dude, that'd be pretty cool.
[23:30.710 --> 23:32.270]  And then we got an Allen Street.
[23:32.490 --> 23:32.770]  What?
[23:33.070 --> 23:33.550]  Where's Ginter Street?
[23:33.590 --> 23:34.630]  By any other name.
[23:34.790 --> 23:35.890]  There probably is a Ginter Street.
[23:36.070 --> 23:38.210]  My mom grew up on Allen Street in San Marino.
[23:38.750 --> 23:42.070]  Well, this one was named after William Henry Allen, the youngest person to command a Navy
[23:42.070 --> 23:43.050]  ship in the War of 1812.
[23:43.590 --> 23:45.730]  Allen Street is a north-south thoroughfare in New York City.
[23:45.850 --> 23:49.230]  It runs through lower Manhattan, neighborhood of Chinatown and the lower east side.
[23:49.450 --> 23:50.530]  That's not San Marino.
[23:50.690 --> 23:51.530]  Do you think that's where...
[23:51.530 --> 23:53.610]  You think that's where, like, Spider-Man does his patrols?
[23:54.110 --> 23:54.830]  Oh, definitely.
[23:54.830 --> 23:55.730]  Oh, that sounds right.
[23:55.910 --> 23:56.270]  100%.
[23:56.270 --> 23:57.990]  I don't know where Queens is, but it's gotta be near there.
[23:59.110 --> 24:03.190]  All the Marvel Universe characters, they all live and operate out of Hell's Kitchen for
[24:03.190 --> 24:03.570]  some reason.
[24:03.650 --> 24:03.810]  Yeah.
[24:05.410 --> 24:05.850]  Uh...
[24:05.850 --> 24:06.410]  You saving the bird?
[24:06.770 --> 24:06.970]  Yeah.
[24:07.110 --> 24:07.990]  Jazz Chisholm.
[24:08.210 --> 24:09.590]  Jazz Chisholm Jr.
[24:10.350 --> 24:10.490]  Great.
[24:10.690 --> 24:11.890]  Zach Nito rookie.
[24:12.450 --> 24:13.670]  Here's Bryce Young again.
[24:13.810 --> 24:14.030]  Oh.
[24:14.650 --> 24:17.970]  This red kite, uh, talented bird.
[24:18.330 --> 24:19.270]  Talented bird?
[24:19.430 --> 24:19.630]  Yeah.
[24:19.850 --> 24:20.290]  Talon.
[24:20.470 --> 24:20.930]  Larry Walker.
[24:20.930 --> 24:26.850]  They are the same family as eagles and harriers and often scavenge along crows.
[24:27.070 --> 24:27.550]  Oh.
[24:28.410 --> 24:32.330]  To protect their young mother, red kites will signal to their babies to play dead to the
[24:32.330 --> 24:36.490]  extent that a predator will leave them, thinking it can return to scavenge later.
[24:36.530 --> 24:37.010]  Oh, weird.
[24:37.530 --> 24:38.270]  Got a...
[24:38.270 --> 24:38.590]  Hey!
[24:38.810 --> 24:38.990]  Hey!
[24:39.150 --> 24:39.630]  The wizard!
[24:40.170 --> 24:41.050]  Yeah, we got a wizard.
[24:41.150 --> 24:42.610]  Ozzie Smith, Black Border Parallel.
[24:42.710 --> 24:44.030]  That's also nice and rare.
[24:44.650 --> 24:45.570]  That's a good card to have.
[24:45.630 --> 24:48.210]  And then our final card is pretty fucking cool.
[24:48.370 --> 24:48.530]  Yeah.
[24:48.810 --> 24:49.530]  Hank Aaron.
[24:49.530 --> 24:52.930]  That filigree parallel that's like one in every 12 packs or whatever.
[24:53.630 --> 24:53.950]  Yeah.
[24:53.950 --> 24:55.390]  Uh, you get about one of these a hobby box.
[24:55.510 --> 24:55.970]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[24:56.090 --> 24:57.930]  So if you're gonna get it, you might as well get fucking Hank Aaron.
[24:58.050 --> 24:59.110]  And then there's him too.
[24:59.270 --> 24:59.570]  That's awesome.
[24:59.570 --> 24:59.650]  That's awesome.
[24:59.750 --> 25:00.270]  And there he is again.
[25:00.470 --> 25:01.070]  He's everywhere, baby.
[25:01.350 --> 25:03.210]  He's one of the only good things about being from Alabama.
[25:03.770 --> 25:04.450]  There you go.
[25:04.910 --> 25:05.110]  Yeah.
[25:05.290 --> 25:06.330]  Charles Barkley, Hank Aaron.
[25:07.970 --> 25:08.290]  Uh...
[25:08.770 --> 25:09.090]  Me.
[25:09.490 --> 25:09.770]  Yeah.
[25:09.950 --> 25:10.470]  And Jimmy Buffett.
[25:10.590 --> 25:11.170]  That's pretty much it.
[25:11.490 --> 25:12.210]  That's all we got.
[25:12.410 --> 25:12.850]  That's true.
[25:12.850 --> 25:13.230]  Pretty good.
[25:13.810 --> 25:14.130]  Uh...
[25:16.750 --> 25:17.070]  Uh...
[25:17.070 --> 25:17.490]  No.
[25:17.490 --> 25:18.090]  Nothing.
[25:18.550 --> 25:20.110]  I got Harper Lee, I guess.
[25:20.350 --> 25:20.710]  Yeah.
[25:20.730 --> 25:21.950]  That's good.
[25:22.470 --> 25:22.950]  Uh...
[25:22.950 --> 25:24.510]  What food is from Alabama?
[25:24.830 --> 25:25.070]  Nothing.
[25:25.210 --> 25:25.930]  Not really any.
[25:26.470 --> 25:26.930]  Boiled peanuts.
[25:27.190 --> 25:27.650]  We have boiled peanuts.
[25:27.650 --> 25:27.870]  Oh, yeah.
[25:27.870 --> 25:29.150]  But they're from South Carolina.
[25:29.330 --> 25:29.850]  I think they were invented.
[25:29.850 --> 25:31.510]  I heard Mardi Gras invented it.
[25:31.510 --> 25:31.550]  Nolan Aranata.
[25:31.850 --> 25:32.090]  Boo!
[25:33.170 --> 25:34.110]  Jose Ramirez.
[25:34.250 --> 25:35.170]  Not a Nolan Aranata fan?
[25:35.190 --> 25:35.710]  Yeah, I don't like Aranata.
[25:35.710 --> 25:36.170]  P.L. Hall.
[25:37.070 --> 25:37.550]  Uh...
[25:37.550 --> 25:38.630]  Here's Mark Ventos.
[25:38.710 --> 25:39.450]  Ozzy Albee.
[25:39.610 --> 25:40.350]  Pedro Guerrero Jr.
[25:40.610 --> 25:41.550]  And Don Mattingly.
[25:41.570 --> 25:42.670]  Shave those sideburns.
[25:44.190 --> 25:45.590]  Is that not an old photo?
[25:45.870 --> 25:46.470]  It is old.
[25:46.550 --> 25:46.750]  Oh.
[25:48.510 --> 25:49.150]  I'm sorry.
[25:49.350 --> 25:50.170]  It is my pick.
[25:51.430 --> 25:54.130]  All right, we'll open up one more of these bad motherfuckers after this one.
[25:54.230 --> 25:55.390]  And then we'll move on to something else.
[25:56.650 --> 25:56.970]  Uh...
[25:56.970 --> 25:58.070]  Corbin Burns.
[25:59.570 --> 25:59.890]  Uh...
[25:59.890 --> 26:02.370]  Anytime I think of him, I think about the actor from L.A. Law.
[26:02.450 --> 26:02.810]  Yeah, I hear you.
[26:02.990 --> 26:03.190]  Yeah.
[26:03.310 --> 26:03.390]  Yeah.
[26:04.690 --> 26:05.010]  Uh...
[26:05.010 --> 26:07.190]  The mini-card is Patrick Wisdom.
[26:07.250 --> 26:08.750]  It's another Alan and Ginter back.
[26:08.870 --> 26:09.130]  Nice.
[26:09.350 --> 26:09.870]  Goddamn, dude.
[26:09.910 --> 26:12.290]  We're getting great mini-pulls on this box.
[26:12.930 --> 26:13.570]  Bo Jackson.
[26:14.550 --> 26:16.730]  Man, I was watching some Bo Jackson.
[26:16.730 --> 26:18.150]  Bo Jackson clips on TikTok the other day.
[26:18.350 --> 26:18.810]  Pretty fucking...
[26:18.810 --> 26:21.470]  You fucking forget how impressive that man was.
[26:21.930 --> 26:22.510]  Uh...
[26:22.510 --> 26:22.850]  Zoo.
[26:23.310 --> 26:23.870]  Who's he?
[26:24.170 --> 26:24.570]  It's Zoo.
[26:25.050 --> 26:26.090]  He's a...
[26:26.090 --> 26:26.450]  Enigma.
[26:29.510 --> 26:31.070]  Again, email...
[26:31.070 --> 26:31.830]  Geoff is...
[26:31.830 --> 26:33.050]  Started Rooster Teeth.
[26:33.550 --> 26:33.990]  Yeah.
[26:34.070 --> 26:35.450]  Started Achievement Hunter.
[26:35.850 --> 26:35.910]  Uh-huh.
[26:36.730 --> 26:39.170]  This is what it says for the Enigma Zoo.
[26:39.710 --> 26:41.610]  His scheduled tour dates in 2020...
[26:41.610 --> 26:42.490]  So, he tours.
[26:42.770 --> 26:42.990]  Cool.
[26:43.470 --> 26:44.210]  Oh, he tours.
[26:44.370 --> 26:44.830]  That's great.
[26:44.830 --> 26:47.690]  Mexico, California, Czech Republic, and Poland.
[26:47.930 --> 26:48.870]  All my favorite places.
[26:49.270 --> 26:50.990]  A testament to the artist's global appeal.
[26:51.070 --> 26:57.930]  In 2016, the San Francisco-born musician released his debut album, Generation Y, which reached
[26:57.930 --> 27:00.170]  number one in Billboard's U.S. Dance Chart.
[27:00.170 --> 27:01.990]  Is it the letter Y or W-H-Y?
[27:03.130 --> 27:04.610]  Uh, it's spelled out.
[27:04.750 --> 27:09.990]  Geoff's company hosted events in Australia and Europe.
[27:10.710 --> 27:11.610]  They made...
[27:11.610 --> 27:12.250]  They played the...
[27:12.250 --> 27:12.670]  Lunatics.
[27:12.830 --> 27:14.370]  Everywhere, like, you know.
[27:14.370 --> 27:14.930]  Derek Jeter.
[27:15.050 --> 27:16.190]  They call him the Captain.
[27:17.730 --> 27:19.730]  Buxton, Reynolds, Ted Williams, speaking of.
[27:19.850 --> 27:19.970]  Hey.
[27:20.310 --> 27:20.450]  Greg Maddox.
[27:21.550 --> 27:23.510]  Anytime you see Greg Maddox, you think of him as a cub.
[27:23.910 --> 27:24.190]  Really?
[27:24.390 --> 27:25.970]  Yeah, everybody thinks of Greg Maddox as a cub.
[27:26.130 --> 27:27.970]  We already talked about this. Ridiculous.
[27:28.570 --> 27:29.530]  All right, one more, I said.
[27:30.610 --> 27:31.190]  And then we'll move on.
[27:31.350 --> 27:35.250]  That's why Alan Ginter really is the best set of cards to get.
[27:35.310 --> 27:36.750]  Because I always go, all right, just one more.
[27:37.550 --> 27:39.210]  Because there's something for everybody.
[27:39.350 --> 27:39.650]  Right.
[27:39.750 --> 27:41.230]  There's birds, there's violins.
[27:41.350 --> 27:42.270]  There's Alan Street.
[27:42.290 --> 27:43.490]  There's Alan Street.
[27:43.490 --> 27:45.370]  All the dance freaks love Zoo.
[27:45.430 --> 27:47.830]  The only thing it's missing is a Geoff Dempsey card.
[27:47.830 --> 27:48.470]  Tommy Edmond.
[27:49.930 --> 27:51.350]  Ryan Nelson, I guess a rookie.
[27:51.790 --> 27:52.470]  Wade Boggs.
[27:52.730 --> 27:54.870]  Once again, when you think of him, you think of him as a devil ray.
[27:55.930 --> 27:56.810]  Zach Wheeler.
[27:57.170 --> 27:58.010]  Spencer Strider.
[27:58.650 --> 27:59.350]  That's a mustache.
[27:59.770 --> 28:00.430]  Spencer Strider.
[28:00.670 --> 28:03.110]  Anytime I see him, I think of Walter Strider.
[28:03.790 --> 28:05.130]  Water Strider from the Tuxedo.
[28:05.310 --> 28:05.690]  Nice.
[28:05.810 --> 28:06.330]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[28:06.470 --> 28:07.670]  First thing I think of every time.
[28:07.870 --> 28:08.270]  That's pretty cool.
[28:09.490 --> 28:10.270]  Barry Zito.
[28:10.610 --> 28:11.630]  Not Chuck Zito.
[28:11.670 --> 28:12.650]  No, different guy.
[28:12.650 --> 28:14.770]  Also, Barry Zito with the A's.
[28:14.910 --> 28:15.110]  Interesting.
[28:15.310 --> 28:15.850]  Not with the Giants.
[28:16.050 --> 28:16.970]  Here's a Golden Eagle.
[28:18.130 --> 28:19.110]  Give me that bird.
[28:19.150 --> 28:19.650]  As it says.
[28:20.230 --> 28:23.410]  And then our mini-card is only in Chicago.
[28:24.650 --> 28:24.830]  Okay.
[28:24.990 --> 28:25.390]  Folks.
[28:27.390 --> 28:33.650]  Revered throughout the world, the beautiful and ferocious Golden Eagle is a national symbol for many countries.
[28:34.410 --> 28:37.790]  Hunts small mammals and doesn't back down from his chariot's prey.
[28:38.210 --> 28:41.670]  Often fighting off coyotes and bears to protect its prize.
[28:41.730 --> 28:42.250]  Fuck yeah.
[28:42.250 --> 28:46.510]  The lustrous eagles have gold plumage and legs that are feathered all the way to their toes.
[28:46.630 --> 28:48.850]  We almost got into a Clutch by Pearls reading there.
[28:48.930 --> 28:49.970]  Jesus Christ.
[28:50.170 --> 28:53.790]  They do books where people fuck birds.
[28:54.250 --> 28:56.090]  Yeah, you can listen to the Thanksgiving episode.
[28:56.330 --> 28:58.650]  The guy had feather-like pubes.
[29:00.750 --> 29:01.590]  Gracie hated that.
[29:03.230 --> 29:04.530]  She's the one who gave her the book.
[29:05.470 --> 29:07.890]  She was the one that's like, please, just do it.
[29:08.090 --> 29:08.930]  And they wrote it.
[29:09.830 --> 29:10.830]  What's next, my friend?
[29:10.850 --> 29:12.070]  Let's open up...
[29:12.590 --> 29:13.930]  Eric calls us friends.
[29:13.930 --> 29:14.650]  Yeah, we're homies.
[29:15.210 --> 29:17.870]  Is that why you're gonna treat him with a little AEW?
[29:18.170 --> 29:19.070]  I'm gonna open up a little AEW.
[29:19.730 --> 29:19.910]  Cool.
[29:19.990 --> 29:22.330]  Stands for All Elite Wrestling.
[29:22.330 --> 29:22.950]  Yes, that's right.
[29:23.130 --> 29:23.510]  That's right.
[29:23.550 --> 29:25.250]  Hey, you know who wrestled All Elite Wrestling?
[29:25.470 --> 29:26.990]  It's my buddy Alex Coughlin.
[29:27.230 --> 29:29.030]  Here's the cyborg Alex Coughlin.
[29:29.110 --> 29:29.650]  The android?
[29:29.870 --> 29:31.550]  Yeah, he wrestled... yeah, he's the android.
[29:31.690 --> 29:32.370]  I called him cyborg.
[29:32.490 --> 29:32.950]  I shouldn't have.
[29:32.990 --> 29:33.450]  He's the android.
[29:33.710 --> 29:35.430]  He wrestles in New Japan Pro Wrestling.
[29:35.550 --> 29:37.910]  He's in a group called Bullet Club War Dogs.
[29:38.030 --> 29:41.130]  And they're cool because they are all foreigners in Japan.
[29:42.170 --> 29:45.890]  They drink beer and smoke cigarettes and that shit rocks.
[29:46.050 --> 29:47.730]  I think that's fucking rad.
[29:47.930 --> 29:49.810]  That's my problem with Masters of the Air.
[29:50.390 --> 29:51.230]  What about it?
[29:51.230 --> 29:51.970]  Not enough cigarettes.
[29:52.290 --> 29:52.990]  That's true.
[29:53.350 --> 29:54.550]  Gotta... dude...
[29:54.550 --> 29:55.930]  It was the 1940s.
[29:56.070 --> 29:57.530]  When you see... here's the thing.
[29:57.630 --> 29:59.610]  This is wrestling that happened like a couple days ago.
[29:59.950 --> 30:05.590]  And these guys walked out to the ring and they had cigarettes in their mouths and they're drinking like tall boy beers.
[30:05.910 --> 30:07.490]  And then wrestled for like 35 minutes.
[30:07.670 --> 30:09.350]  And I'm like, these are the fucking guys right here.
[30:09.610 --> 30:10.210]  That shit rocks.
[30:10.210 --> 30:12.070]  I think that's so cool.
[30:12.090 --> 30:13.210]  You guys are awesome.
[30:13.590 --> 30:14.130]  I can't wait.
[30:14.550 --> 30:15.650]  I'm gonna go through two packs at once.
[30:15.670 --> 30:16.110]  Hell yeah!
[30:16.350 --> 30:17.990]  Let's get back into it.
[30:18.270 --> 30:19.790]  Put your wrestling goggles on.
[30:19.950 --> 30:21.050]  Okay, here come my wrestling goggles.
[30:21.150 --> 30:22.450]  Put your wrestling panties on.
[30:22.450 --> 30:23.270]  So that you can talk about...
[30:23.270 --> 30:23.710]  My panties are on.
[30:23.810 --> 30:24.730]  Our buddies Top Flight.
[30:24.810 --> 30:26.650]  Top Flight, Darius and Dante Martin.
[30:26.750 --> 30:28.010]  They're brothers from Minnesota.
[30:28.250 --> 30:29.470]  Originally born in Tennessee.
[30:29.710 --> 30:30.890]  Yeah, they fly all around.
[30:31.390 --> 30:33.050]  They do like crazy flying moves.
[30:33.570 --> 30:33.770]  Cool.
[30:34.130 --> 30:36.390]  Everybody knows this guy, famous for hating Peter Pan.
[30:36.490 --> 30:36.930]  It's Hook.
[30:37.430 --> 30:37.870]  Oh!
[30:38.050 --> 30:39.170]  That's Taz's son.
[30:39.170 --> 30:40.170]  He's from...
[30:40.170 --> 30:43.050]  He's the FTW champion.
[30:43.510 --> 30:43.950]  What's FTW?
[30:44.070 --> 30:45.290]  Fuck the world.
[30:45.470 --> 30:47.210]  Do you know who the Buffalo Kids are?
[30:47.370 --> 30:48.270]  The Buffalo Kids?
[30:48.670 --> 30:49.570]  Yeah, Eddie Kingston.
[30:49.950 --> 30:50.650]  He likes to wear a shirt.
[30:50.870 --> 30:50.890]  Oh!
[30:51.190 --> 30:52.390]  Eddie Kingston's from New York.
[30:52.550 --> 30:54.150]  And he just looks like he's from New York.
[30:54.310 --> 30:55.310]  But from Buffalo.
[30:55.470 --> 30:58.350]  Yeah, I mean, he's from Yonkers.
[30:59.070 --> 31:01.510]  And then Buffalo Kids, I think, is probably a charity from one of those places.
[31:01.530 --> 31:03.070]  You know where they go in Hello Dolly?
[31:03.410 --> 31:03.690]  Hello!
[31:04.770 --> 31:05.130]  Yeah.
[31:05.250 --> 31:05.690]  There you go.
[31:05.810 --> 31:07.030]  You see Eddie Kingston.
[31:07.550 --> 31:08.390]  Yeah, they see him.
[31:08.390 --> 31:09.110]  Here we go.
[31:09.170 --> 31:09.870]  It's Darby Allen.
[31:09.910 --> 31:10.830]  I think we saw him last week.
[31:11.070 --> 31:14.610]  I just realized, is it like a Darby crashed Gigi Allen kind of thing?
[31:14.990 --> 31:15.010]  Yeah.
[31:16.230 --> 31:20.470]  Darby Allen, his entrance video, was animated by Rooster Teeth.
[31:20.730 --> 31:21.050]  Hey!
[31:21.870 --> 31:25.010]  The company that was, you know, co-created by Geoff Ramsey.
[31:25.190 --> 31:26.470]  You can just say founded.
[31:26.610 --> 31:27.610]  You don't even have to put co with it.
[31:27.630 --> 31:28.110]  I know.
[31:28.490 --> 31:29.170]  You know, he did.
[31:29.330 --> 31:29.510]  Yeah.
[31:29.630 --> 31:31.210]  Yeah, fuck Bernie and Gus and Matt.
[31:31.210 --> 31:31.690]  That's what I was going to say.
[31:31.710 --> 31:32.050]  What are they going to do?
[31:32.130 --> 31:32.870]  They're not watching this.
[31:33.030 --> 31:33.950]  They don't know what we're doing.
[31:33.950 --> 31:34.570]  What are they going to do?
[31:34.610 --> 31:35.270]  Make content?
[31:35.270 --> 31:36.290]  Not likely.
[31:36.870 --> 31:37.270]  Okay.
[31:38.610 --> 31:39.410]  Julia Hart.
[31:39.550 --> 31:44.330]  Yeah, she's spooky and wearing a hat like she's going to a show at South by Southwestern.
[31:45.030 --> 31:47.890]  I just spent a lot of time with Bernie, actually, last week.
[31:48.310 --> 31:48.970]  He's alright.
[31:51.170 --> 31:51.570]  Okay.
[31:52.850 --> 31:53.590]  Keith Lee.
[31:53.750 --> 31:54.370]  Oh, hell yeah.
[31:54.530 --> 31:55.010]  That guy's huge.
[31:55.270 --> 31:56.070]  He is a big guy.
[31:56.070 --> 31:56.710]  Yeah, he's a big guy.
[31:56.790 --> 31:58.030]  Small packages are such a big deal.
[31:59.190 --> 32:00.170]  I think that's all relative.
[32:02.390 --> 32:04.370]  Dante Martin and Darius Martin.
[32:04.410 --> 32:04.810]  Are they brothers?
[32:04.810 --> 32:05.590]  They are.
[32:05.730 --> 32:07.850]  They're from a team called Top Flight.
[32:08.070 --> 32:09.790]  Originally, they're from Minnesota, originally from Tennessee.
[32:10.030 --> 32:11.570]  They fly all over the top rope and everything, you know?
[32:11.630 --> 32:12.950]  Do you want these all sleeved?
[32:13.070 --> 32:13.650]  No, just that one.
[32:13.690 --> 32:13.910]  This one?
[32:13.970 --> 32:14.150]  Okay.
[32:14.370 --> 32:15.090]  Oh, you got a crush on her?
[32:15.090 --> 32:16.590]  Sorry, I wasn't trying to...
[32:16.590 --> 32:17.810]  You have a crush on her?
[32:18.190 --> 32:18.710]  No, you do.
[32:18.730 --> 32:19.190]  Julia Hart, yeah.
[32:19.990 --> 32:20.790]  It's just a parallel.
[32:21.250 --> 32:21.350]  Oh.
[32:22.010 --> 32:22.370]  Sting.
[32:22.710 --> 32:24.990]  Well, he's really boned it in on the outfit these days.
[32:25.630 --> 32:26.330]  That's just...
[32:26.330 --> 32:27.610]  Dude, he's 62 or something?
[32:27.790 --> 32:29.130]  Like, he's still fucking wrestling?
[32:29.370 --> 32:29.870]  He's crazy.
[32:30.250 --> 32:30.350]  Wow.
[32:30.350 --> 32:31.550]  I just saw...
[32:31.550 --> 32:33.890]  This is the last season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, right?
[32:33.890 --> 32:35.670]  And I was trying to figure it out.
[32:35.730 --> 32:37.090]  I think...
[32:37.090 --> 32:38.870]  Is Larry David, like, 80?
[32:39.230 --> 32:39.650]  I don't know.
[32:39.750 --> 32:40.090]  Let's find out.
[32:40.150 --> 32:41.810]  I think he's like 78 or something.
[32:41.810 --> 32:43.610]  How old is Larry David?
[32:43.610 --> 32:45.050]  I would have guessed he was like 65.
[32:45.330 --> 32:46.630]  Wait, before you move...
[32:46.630 --> 32:47.670]  I'm going to say 78.
[32:48.090 --> 32:48.890]  I'll take the under.
[32:50.150 --> 32:50.550]  76.
[32:51.070 --> 32:51.790]  Wow, he's not...
[32:51.790 --> 32:51.870]  I win.
[32:53.470 --> 32:54.770]  Uh, Stokely Holloway?
[32:55.490 --> 32:56.290]  Stokely Hathaway.
[32:56.570 --> 32:56.670]  Hathaway?
[32:56.790 --> 32:57.450]  Yeah, he's great.
[32:57.550 --> 32:58.810]  Great manager, great talker.
[32:59.010 --> 32:59.730]  I love Stokely.
[32:59.970 --> 33:00.530]  Big Stoke.
[33:00.690 --> 33:01.390]  Adam Cole.
[33:01.530 --> 33:03.150]  Looks like he's trying to be Nick Cage in The Rock.
[33:03.150 --> 33:03.650]  Really?
[33:03.910 --> 33:04.090]  Yeah.
[33:04.190 --> 33:05.690]  Being a cool guy walking away from an explosion?
[33:05.970 --> 33:07.550]  He streams video games and stuff.
[33:07.670 --> 33:07.970]  Oh.
[33:08.170 --> 33:08.470]  Okay.
[33:08.630 --> 33:09.290]  Well, we don't like him.
[33:09.430 --> 33:09.790]  You tell me.
[33:10.690 --> 33:11.410]  Jake Hager.
[33:11.870 --> 33:12.390]  Hell yeah!
[33:12.610 --> 33:13.470]  He wrestled...
[33:13.470 --> 33:14.410]  He fought in Bellator.
[33:15.250 --> 33:15.830]  Oh, did he really?
[33:15.910 --> 33:16.070]  Yeah.
[33:16.370 --> 33:16.590]  Oh, wow.
[33:16.590 --> 33:17.030]  He's a Bellator fighter.
[33:17.090 --> 33:17.610]  He's a big guy.
[33:17.750 --> 33:18.230]  Big motherfucker.
[33:19.070 --> 33:19.970]  From Perry, Oklahoma.
[33:20.790 --> 33:21.510]  Lee Moriarty.
[33:21.530 --> 33:22.150]  Yeah, Lee Moriarty.
[33:22.230 --> 33:23.570]  That's the mask that he comes out with.
[33:23.770 --> 33:24.490]  Tiger style.
[33:24.790 --> 33:25.150]  He's...
[33:25.150 --> 33:25.430]  That's cool.
[33:25.570 --> 33:26.170]  I like that mask.
[33:26.750 --> 33:27.370]  You can make one.
[33:27.550 --> 33:29.270]  Colton Gwynn is a dazzler.
[33:29.510 --> 33:30.170]  Colton Gun.
[33:30.170 --> 33:30.870]  He's a useless X-Man.
[33:30.950 --> 33:31.670]  Yeah, that's...
[33:32.670 --> 33:33.190]  Colton Gun.
[33:33.230 --> 33:34.590]  He just, like, puts out, like, sparklers.
[33:34.870 --> 33:35.770]  That's what she does, yeah.
[33:35.770 --> 33:36.190]  Oh, really?
[33:36.570 --> 33:37.270]  She's like a disco...
[33:40.370 --> 33:41.010]  This is...
[33:41.010 --> 33:44.070]  This card is actually, I think, an SP, and I think might have a little bit of value to
[33:44.070 --> 33:44.150]  it.
[33:44.170 --> 33:44.370]  Cool.
[33:44.370 --> 33:44.970]  We'll just leave that.
[33:46.550 --> 33:47.630]  This is Greg Miller.
[33:49.510 --> 33:50.150]  Tony Schiavone.
[33:50.730 --> 33:51.370]  Tony Schiavone.
[33:51.690 --> 33:52.350]  I like Tony Schiavone.
[33:52.490 --> 33:52.850]  Cool guy.
[33:54.010 --> 33:55.910]  The Jericho Appreciation Society.
[33:55.990 --> 33:56.450]  Yeah, there they are.
[33:56.510 --> 33:57.330]  You see Jake Hager in the back.
[33:57.370 --> 33:58.090]  He loves that hat.
[33:58.270 --> 33:59.190]  You can see all the team.
[33:59.450 --> 33:59.770]  Wait.
[33:59.770 --> 34:00.770]  They look like a dance troupe.
[34:01.390 --> 34:01.790]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:01.790 --> 34:02.010]  Do they dance?
[34:02.010 --> 34:05.030]  They look like Kelvin from Righteous Gemstones.
[34:05.290 --> 34:05.530]  Righteous Gemstones?
[34:05.750 --> 34:06.390]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:07.130 --> 34:07.930]  That's a pretty good group.
[34:08.030 --> 34:08.430]  That's funny.
[34:10.030 --> 34:11.270]  Then there's Lee Moriarty.
[34:11.370 --> 34:12.210]  There he is without the mask.
[34:13.710 --> 34:14.510]  There you go.
[34:14.590 --> 34:14.990]  There you go.
[34:15.010 --> 34:16.350]  We got a lot more of the...
[34:16.350 --> 34:17.510]  Oh, get the fuck out of here, Sting.
[34:18.290 --> 34:18.610]  Sting!
[34:19.310 --> 34:21.990]  He was in, like, outside of, like, San Antonio, I think.
[34:22.130 --> 34:25.490]  I was about to say, I know you're going to say Texas, because apparently all wrestlers
[34:25.490 --> 34:25.970]  live in Texas.
[34:26.050 --> 34:26.170]  Yeah.
[34:26.390 --> 34:27.170]  I think...
[34:27.170 --> 34:27.830]  It's a tax thing.
[34:27.910 --> 34:28.430]  That and Florida.
[34:28.610 --> 34:28.850]  Yeah.
[34:29.310 --> 34:29.630]  Interesting.
[34:30.570 --> 34:31.370]  Sammy Guevara.
[34:31.530 --> 34:32.350]  Sammy Guevara.
[34:32.630 --> 34:33.730]  He's from Houston, I think.
[34:34.490 --> 34:35.290]  Willow Nightingale.
[34:35.450 --> 34:36.250]  Yeah, she's great.
[34:36.410 --> 34:37.030]  Willow's awesome.
[34:38.310 --> 34:39.110]  Renee Paquette.
[34:39.270 --> 34:40.350]  Yeah, she's an announcer.
[34:40.770 --> 34:41.050]  Nice.
[34:41.150 --> 34:42.050]  Married to one of the wrestlers.
[34:42.210 --> 34:43.250]  Can we get a mic check?
[34:43.710 --> 34:44.490]  Hell, yeah.
[34:44.670 --> 34:45.010]  On Pac.
[34:45.010 --> 34:45.210]  Pac.
[34:45.770 --> 34:46.470]  What's his deal?
[34:46.710 --> 34:48.470]  He's fucking shredded, and he's the bastard.
[34:50.210 --> 34:51.530]  I'm the shredded bastard.
[34:51.570 --> 34:51.910]  Mm-hmm.
[34:52.450 --> 34:53.430]  Stamping into the ring.
[34:53.470 --> 34:54.450]  Dude, swerve strickling.
[34:55.390 --> 34:55.790]  Swerve.
[34:55.810 --> 34:56.510]  This guy's going to have a match on Wednesday.
[34:56.570 --> 34:57.310]  It's going to be real good.
[34:58.910 --> 34:59.610]  Dan Howell.
[35:00.230 --> 35:02.630]  Yeah, he's like a little, he's like a gremlin guy.
[35:02.650 --> 35:03.950]  Is he old-spec, too?
[35:04.030 --> 35:04.830]  He's like a Hankubus?
[35:04.950 --> 35:07.010]  No, no, he's just, yeah, he's like a, yeah, he's like that.
[35:07.070 --> 35:09.030]  He's like, yeah, like he old, he's like a little gremlin guy.
[35:09.150 --> 35:09.450]  Yes, master.
[35:09.450 --> 35:10.950]  Yeah, he's like that kind of thing.
[35:12.770 --> 35:13.090]  Myth?
[35:13.370 --> 35:13.990]  Is that what that says?
[35:14.430 --> 35:14.750]  MJF.
[35:14.950 --> 35:15.270]  MJF?
[35:15.290 --> 35:15.430]  Yeah.
[35:15.490 --> 35:16.070]  He doesn't know.
[35:16.290 --> 35:16.470]  Yeah.
[35:17.670 --> 35:18.430]  He's from Long Island.
[35:18.970 --> 35:20.490]  Fucking, that belt is half him.
[35:20.610 --> 35:20.790]  Yeah.
[35:21.250 --> 35:21.570]  Athena.
[35:21.890 --> 35:22.870]  Yeah, she's from Dallas.
[35:23.390 --> 35:23.990]  Of course she is.
[35:24.030 --> 35:24.610]  They're all from Texas.
[35:24.610 --> 35:25.470]  All from Tejas.
[35:26.190 --> 35:26.710]  All right, dude.
[35:26.710 --> 35:29.430]  Let's fucking crank through this.
[35:29.770 --> 35:30.170]  Oh!
[35:30.550 --> 35:31.410]  Wheeler Uda.
[35:31.830 --> 35:32.230]  Cool.
[35:32.870 --> 35:34.730]  He's a good pure wrestler.
[35:34.990 --> 35:35.230]  Oh, yeah?
[35:35.290 --> 35:35.870]  You like his look?
[35:36.110 --> 35:38.270]  No, just that you were just like, yep, cool.
[35:38.470 --> 35:40.290]  I mean, hey, man, it's Wheeler Uda.
[35:42.070 --> 35:44.390]  Oh, dude, fucking, I know this dude.
[35:44.510 --> 35:46.750]  Arne Anderson and Brock Anderson.
[35:46.890 --> 35:47.810]  And that's his son, Brock Anderson.
[35:47.910 --> 35:49.710]  Arne Anderson, one of the four horsemen.
[35:49.770 --> 35:51.570]  Yeah, one of the fucking four horsemen of the apocalypse.
[35:51.730 --> 35:54.890]  Arne Anderson looking like the dude from Tenacious D right there.
[35:55.150 --> 35:55.590]  Yeah, big time.
[35:55.910 --> 35:56.310]  Big time.
[35:57.590 --> 35:58.470]  Ricky Starks.
[36:00.150 --> 36:04.050]  From New Orleans and then trained and lives, I think he still lives in Austin.
[36:04.690 --> 36:07.610]  Trained at AAPW, I think, where I do the commentary.
[36:07.870 --> 36:08.210]  Oh, shit.
[36:08.230 --> 36:08.630]  Yeah, see him there.
[36:08.630 --> 36:09.390]  You guys are like friends.
[36:09.710 --> 36:10.150]  No.
[36:10.870 --> 36:12.090]  He doesn't like you?
[36:12.130 --> 36:13.530]  Yeah, he fucking hates me.
[36:14.050 --> 36:14.550]  Do you guys have beef?
[36:15.490 --> 36:15.930]  Yeah.
[36:16.190 --> 36:17.770]  What keeps you interested in this?
[36:19.870 --> 36:20.850]  Ricky Stark's awesome.
[36:20.910 --> 36:21.370]  Austin guy.
[36:21.510 --> 36:21.850]  He's great.
[36:22.230 --> 36:23.390]  Smart Mark Sterling.
[36:23.570 --> 36:26.130]  If you have to put smart in quotes, you're probably not.
[36:26.130 --> 36:27.510]  Well, he's a wrestling lawyer.
[36:28.010 --> 36:28.370]  Oh.
[36:29.130 --> 36:30.910]  Here's a parallel of Willa Nightingale again.
[36:31.130 --> 36:31.670]  Let's leave that.
[36:32.010 --> 36:34.410]  How do we get an Eric Bedore AEW card?
[36:34.510 --> 36:35.310]  Well, I'd have to work there.
[36:35.450 --> 36:36.210]  Aubrey Edwards.
[36:36.390 --> 36:38.110]  Can we get an Eric Bedore AAPW?
[36:38.270 --> 36:38.950]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:39.090 --> 36:39.550]  Yeah, sure.
[36:40.510 --> 36:41.230]  Anna Jay.
[36:41.530 --> 36:41.890]  Mm-hmm.
[36:42.930 --> 36:44.550]  She has a fat ass and a bad attitude.
[36:44.710 --> 36:46.050]  I'm just quoting what's on her shirt.
[36:46.310 --> 36:46.590]  Oh, yeah.
[36:46.710 --> 36:47.070]  Same.
[36:47.390 --> 36:48.130]  That's what she says.
[36:48.310 --> 36:48.670]  Same.
[36:48.730 --> 36:49.770]  I'm just letting you know what she says.
[36:49.770 --> 36:51.430]  You do have a fat ass and a bad attitude.
[36:51.530 --> 36:52.470]  Hell yeah, I do.
[36:53.330 --> 36:54.050]  Private Party.
[36:54.790 --> 36:55.430]  They're great.
[36:55.430 --> 36:57.230]  Seeing them wrestle live is just a lot of fun.
[36:57.230 --> 36:59.010]  Isaiah Kinski and Mark Queen.
[36:59.230 --> 37:00.170]  They look like male strippers.
[37:00.370 --> 37:01.350]  Isaiah Kassidy and Mark Quinn.
[37:01.550 --> 37:02.030]  That's cool.
[37:02.130 --> 37:02.250]  Yeah.
[37:03.410 --> 37:04.330]  That's a cool schtick.
[37:04.630 --> 37:04.810]  Yep.
[37:05.730 --> 37:06.150]  All right.
[37:06.350 --> 37:08.050]  Let's put one of these bad boys away.
[37:08.110 --> 37:08.370]  Okay.
[37:08.530 --> 37:09.210]  In the pack sack.
[37:09.570 --> 37:10.250]  And then we'll open up those.
[37:10.250 --> 37:11.370]  And then we'll go through them, man.
[37:11.510 --> 37:12.110]  We got two more.
[37:12.270 --> 37:12.490]  Cool.
[37:12.530 --> 37:13.670]  And then we'll move on to something else.
[37:13.850 --> 37:14.130]  Great.
[37:14.970 --> 37:17.030]  I was gonna do some more football, but you fucking hate these mosaics.
[37:17.030 --> 37:18.610]  No, I just didn't like those.
[37:18.730 --> 37:19.310]  Well, let's not.
[37:19.590 --> 37:19.990]  I think that's all we have.
[37:19.990 --> 37:20.630]  I think they're just ugly.
[37:20.650 --> 37:21.510]  So let's do something else.
[37:21.550 --> 37:21.750]  You know?
[37:21.950 --> 37:22.350]  Let's keep it.
[37:22.350 --> 37:23.150]  Let's keep it.
[37:23.230 --> 37:24.090]  It's about keeping Eric's silly mood going.
[37:24.370 --> 37:24.430]  Yeah.
[37:24.650 --> 37:25.150]  Matt Jackson.
[37:25.410 --> 37:26.490]  Does he get silly, Eric?
[37:26.550 --> 37:28.170]  Or you get, like, thinking about getting mad, Eric?
[37:28.250 --> 37:28.430]  Yeah.
[37:30.230 --> 37:30.830]  No, no.
[37:30.950 --> 37:31.630]  Here's the guns.
[37:31.910 --> 37:32.010]  Yeah.
[37:32.070 --> 37:32.330]  Hell yeah.
[37:33.890 --> 37:34.450]  Max Castor.
[37:34.650 --> 37:34.810]  Yeah.
[37:34.890 --> 37:35.850]  He does rap.
[37:36.050 --> 37:36.570]  It seems like it.
[37:36.650 --> 37:36.750]  Yeah.
[37:36.830 --> 37:38.450]  He has the little headphones on like your friend.
[37:38.450 --> 37:38.630]  Yeah.
[37:38.650 --> 37:39.550]  Well, he does the entrance.
[37:39.650 --> 37:40.350]  He wears the headphones.
[37:40.450 --> 37:42.030]  And then he raps on his way to the ring.
[37:42.050 --> 37:43.750]  But it's cool because he started as a bad guy.
[37:43.770 --> 37:45.390]  And that meant he just didn't have to rap well.
[37:45.710 --> 37:46.090]  And that's fine.
[37:46.150 --> 37:46.430]  Oh.
[37:46.650 --> 37:46.810]  Yeah.
[37:47.090 --> 37:47.850]  You don't have to be very good.
[37:47.890 --> 37:48.510]  You just gotta be good enough.
[37:48.730 --> 37:49.270]  Chris Jericho.
[37:49.270 --> 37:50.790]  Oh, he's gonna prey on it.
[37:50.870 --> 37:51.070]  Yeah.
[37:51.150 --> 37:51.430]  He's thinking.
[37:51.430 --> 37:52.130]  He's thinking about it.
[37:52.170 --> 37:55.190]  Here's some sort of an explosion parallel for Darius Mark.
[37:55.210 --> 37:55.810]  We have gotten...
[37:55.810 --> 37:56.030]  This is numbered.
[37:56.210 --> 37:59.390]  We have gotten so many of these fucking brothers.
[37:59.930 --> 38:00.070]  Yeah.
[38:00.130 --> 38:01.890]  We have to stop getting top flight.
[38:02.130 --> 38:02.830]  We have to stop.
[38:02.910 --> 38:04.210]  It's a really cool parallel, though.
[38:04.270 --> 38:04.570]  Look at that.
[38:04.670 --> 38:06.030]  Kaboom, kaboom, kaboom, kaboom.
[38:06.310 --> 38:07.630]  That is a good background.
[38:08.110 --> 38:09.170]  Ooh, Angelo Parker.
[38:09.310 --> 38:10.010]  We haven't gotten to that yet.
[38:10.190 --> 38:11.490]  Cool hand Ang.
[38:11.590 --> 38:12.310]  Angelo Parker.
[38:12.630 --> 38:13.690]  He just keeps combing his hair.
[38:14.650 --> 38:15.370]  Colton Gunn.
[38:15.570 --> 38:15.950]  Hell yeah.
[38:16.170 --> 38:16.630]  That's God.
[38:16.850 --> 38:17.710]  Geoff, do your hair like that.
[38:17.730 --> 38:18.690]  Does he have a braid in the front?
[38:18.690 --> 38:19.410]  Oh, absolutely.
[38:19.530 --> 38:20.570]  He has two, Emily.
[38:21.130 --> 38:21.490]  Yeah.
[38:21.610 --> 38:22.130]  Dude, and here is...
[38:22.130 --> 38:23.270]  Those are like the slut strands.
[38:23.330 --> 38:23.610]  Yes.
[38:24.210 --> 38:25.830]  He's a heel, and boy, it works.
[38:25.890 --> 38:27.490]  When you see him, you just go, don't like that guy.
[38:28.150 --> 38:32.090]  Here is Julia Hart looking like she's about to go antiquing a round rug at Round Top Texas.
[38:33.570 --> 38:36.330]  She's about to go pay way too much money for a giant door.
[38:36.490 --> 38:36.650]  Yep.
[38:37.250 --> 38:37.530]  One more?
[38:37.890 --> 38:38.570]  Yeah, we got one more.
[38:38.670 --> 38:38.930]  All right.
[38:39.150 --> 38:40.990]  That's a localized Texas thing.
[38:41.050 --> 38:42.770]  Round Top is where all the people who...
[38:42.770 --> 38:43.750]  You said this last week.
[38:43.990 --> 38:44.270]  Did I?
[38:44.430 --> 38:44.710]  Yes.
[38:44.750 --> 38:45.190]  It comes up a lot.
[38:46.850 --> 38:48.870]  Stop wearing the stupid hat, and I'll stop making fun of it.
[38:48.890 --> 38:49.310]  Stop wearing the hat.
[38:49.510 --> 38:54.270]  She looks like she's at South by Southwest in 2016 reluctantly drinking a Lone Star.
[38:54.550 --> 38:55.010]  It's like, damn.
[38:55.690 --> 38:56.410]  Jamie Hayter.
[38:56.830 --> 38:57.330]  Oh, yeah.
[38:57.430 --> 38:57.770]  She's British.
[38:57.830 --> 38:58.490]  She's a former champion.
[38:58.550 --> 38:59.090]  She's awesome.
[38:59.370 --> 38:59.930]  Jamie Hayter, great.
[39:00.070 --> 39:00.410]  Hit hard.
[39:01.590 --> 39:02.310]  Justin Roberts.
[39:02.650 --> 39:03.390]  It's an announcer.
[39:03.510 --> 39:04.270]  He loves the Golden Girls.
[39:05.370 --> 39:06.430]  Hangman Adam Page.
[39:06.450 --> 39:07.270]  Hell, yeah.
[39:07.710 --> 39:08.630]  Is he fighting those jeans?
[39:08.670 --> 39:09.930]  Packing some beef in those jeans.
[39:09.930 --> 39:10.850]  He's like...
[39:10.850 --> 39:11.890]  He's the cowboy.
[39:12.070 --> 39:12.230]  Fucking awesome.
[39:12.690 --> 39:14.210]  He's like, I'll still keep my phone.
[39:14.210 --> 39:15.130]  Oh, yeah.
[39:15.290 --> 39:15.670]  100%.
[39:15.670 --> 39:16.210]  He's awesome.
[39:16.410 --> 39:17.250]  Here we go.
[39:17.290 --> 39:17.890]  Tag teams.
[39:18.110 --> 39:18.870]  The Acclaimed.
[39:19.490 --> 39:21.270]  He's wrapping his way to the ring, and it's great.
[39:21.450 --> 39:22.090]  They scissor each other.
[39:22.170 --> 39:22.630]  They do this.
[39:22.890 --> 39:23.450]  Oh, really?
[39:23.990 --> 39:24.590]  The crowd.
[39:25.350 --> 39:25.990]  They all...
[39:25.990 --> 39:26.690]  So, they're with...
[39:26.690 --> 39:27.950]  Do they just rub their balls together?
[39:28.170 --> 39:28.270]  No.
[39:28.670 --> 39:29.850]  So, they do this.
[39:30.370 --> 39:31.240]  That's like their handshake.
[39:32.010 --> 39:32.790]  No, that's like their handshake.
[39:33.170 --> 39:34.050]  They go like that.
[39:35.150 --> 39:40.130]  And they're with another guy who's badass Billy Gunn who was in the WWF in the 90s.
[39:40.130 --> 39:41.110]  And he just licks their fingers?
[39:41.410 --> 39:43.510]  He's still around with them, and his name's Daddy Ass.
[39:43.510 --> 39:45.370]  And he says, scissor me, Daddy Ass.
[39:45.430 --> 39:48.290]  And the whole crowd just starts fucking doing it.
[39:48.290 --> 39:48.970]  What the fuck?
[39:49.170 --> 39:51.110]  It's just like these nine-year-olds going, yeah!
[39:51.970 --> 39:54.150]  And my friend Robbie going, this is fucked.
[39:54.330 --> 39:56.210]  And you have a problem with her sex life.
[39:57.070 --> 39:58.070]  That's the new...
[39:58.070 --> 39:59.230]  Scissor me, Daddy Ass.
[39:59.230 --> 40:00.930]  When we were that age being like, suck it!
[40:00.930 --> 40:01.930]  That's exactly what it is.
[40:02.130 --> 40:03.530]  And the guy...
[40:03.530 --> 40:08.330]  One of the guys who would do suck it is badass Billy Gunn who's with them doing the scissor thing.
[40:08.350 --> 40:09.390]  Oh, my God.
[40:09.710 --> 40:10.770]  You guys had the suck it.
[40:10.930 --> 40:12.690]  My generation, we didn't have the suck it yet.
[40:12.690 --> 40:13.630]  We had this...
[40:14.470 --> 40:16.110]  Oh, you did like this?
[40:16.590 --> 40:20.710]  Dude, in eighth grade, if you weren't telling people to suck it, I don't know what the fuck you were doing.
[40:20.830 --> 40:21.110]  I know.
[40:21.270 --> 40:22.890]  If you weren't telling a teacher to suck it...
[40:22.890 --> 40:26.010]  Canvas Jake Hager parallel or insert.
[40:26.230 --> 40:26.750]  That's pretty cool.
[40:26.750 --> 40:27.270]  It's like Matt.
[40:27.390 --> 40:28.110]  They're scissoring.
[40:29.350 --> 40:30.770]  It's an ankle lock.
[40:31.150 --> 40:32.690]  Sammy Guevara and Taye Mello.
[40:33.350 --> 40:34.150]  They're married.
[40:34.670 --> 40:35.190]  That makes sense.
[40:35.770 --> 40:36.710]  He's got her shirt on.
[40:36.810 --> 40:37.910]  I think we talked about them last time.
[40:38.010 --> 40:38.170]  Yeah.
[40:38.350 --> 40:38.910]  He's a good husband.
[40:39.650 --> 40:40.050]  Excalibur.
[40:40.070 --> 40:40.790]  He supports her.
[40:41.710 --> 40:42.570]  That's a sword.
[40:42.750 --> 40:43.790]  No, he's the announcer.
[40:45.350 --> 40:46.150]  Hikaru Shida.
[40:47.990 --> 40:48.790]  All right.
[40:48.790 --> 40:49.410]  Well, there we go.
[40:49.470 --> 40:50.470]  That's what's up with those.
[40:50.510 --> 40:51.490]  She's a kendo stick.
[40:51.910 --> 40:52.450]  Oh, shit.
[40:53.370 --> 40:54.570]  Oh, this would be fun.
[40:55.470 --> 40:55.790]  Let's...
[40:55.790 --> 40:56.070]  No.
[40:56.690 --> 40:56.910]  Thanks.
[40:57.030 --> 40:58.690]  Go buy an Alex Coghlan shirt.
[40:58.910 --> 40:59.690]  It gets paid in Japan.
[41:00.110 --> 41:01.670]  You go buy Starbucks coffee in Japan.
[41:02.250 --> 41:03.470]  Eric, this is a special one for you.
[41:03.530 --> 41:04.030]  Yeah, what you got?
[41:04.110 --> 41:07.670]  This is World Wrestling Federation superstar cards.
[41:08.410 --> 41:09.870]  Show me the big boss.
[41:09.870 --> 41:10.970]  It's back when...
[41:10.970 --> 41:11.870]  Back when it was great.
[41:11.990 --> 41:12.910]  Big boss man.
[41:13.010 --> 41:14.870]  Hillbilly Jim and the Iron Sheik.
[41:17.830 --> 41:19.910]  Leaping Lenny Poffo.
[41:21.850 --> 41:22.730]  This is...
[41:22.730 --> 41:26.450]  When we get to do deep cut Howard Stern bullshit, I love it.
[41:26.470 --> 41:27.270]  It is my favorite.
[41:27.270 --> 41:28.790]  It's for nobody but us.
[41:28.890 --> 41:29.690]  The Rockers.
[41:29.850 --> 41:33.170]  Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty, who I think maybe just got his foot amputated.
[41:33.430 --> 41:33.730]  Why?
[41:33.970 --> 41:34.590]  Oh, diabetes?
[41:34.870 --> 41:34.910]  Oh, no.
[41:35.110 --> 41:36.170]  Hard work, you know?
[41:36.290 --> 41:36.970]  Coco Beware.
[41:37.130 --> 41:37.870]  Oh, he's got the bird.
[41:37.870 --> 41:38.650]  He did the...
[41:38.650 --> 41:39.770]  Dude, he would go to...
[41:39.770 --> 41:44.490]  I went to a death match wrestling show yesterday where my friends were wrestling.
[41:46.030 --> 41:52.690]  Somebody brought a bird in a cage and they had front row tickets and they had to leave
[41:52.690 --> 41:57.610]  before the main event because they started bringing out the light tubes and it would
[41:57.610 --> 41:57.990]  just...
[41:57.990 --> 41:58.930]  Glass went everywhere.
[41:59.310 --> 42:00.870]  Glass went everywhere.
[42:01.110 --> 42:01.250]  Oh, my God.
[42:01.250 --> 42:02.610]  And it would have just gotten all over the bird.
[42:02.730 --> 42:03.610]  Oh, my Lord.
[42:04.030 --> 42:05.550]  And then my friend got syringes in his mouth.
[42:06.070 --> 42:07.070]  It was pretty cool.
[42:07.590 --> 42:11.050]  Once again, problem with your double penetration.
[42:11.850 --> 42:12.570]  Nasty boys.
[42:12.730 --> 42:14.530]  Speaking of Italy, the Nasty Boys.
[42:15.070 --> 42:16.570]  Oh, this is my jam.
[42:16.690 --> 42:17.430]  This is my shit right here.
[42:17.530 --> 42:17.650]  Yeah, what you got?
[42:17.950 --> 42:19.870]  It didn't get any cooler than this.
[42:19.930 --> 42:20.110]  Okay.
[42:20.710 --> 42:21.370]  I'm gonna guess.
[42:21.770 --> 42:22.770]  What do you think I'm gonna say?
[42:23.110 --> 42:23.890]  Oh, boy.
[42:23.890 --> 42:25.050]  It doesn't get cooler than these...
[42:25.050 --> 42:26.850]  I'll even say these three motherfuckers.
[42:26.930 --> 42:27.570]  Oh, wow.
[42:28.510 --> 42:29.590]  I don't know who it would be.
[42:30.430 --> 42:31.010]  Who it is?
[42:31.430 --> 42:32.650]  It'd be the Legion of fucking Doom.
[42:32.670 --> 42:33.370]  Oh, fuck.
[42:33.630 --> 42:35.250]  Dusty Rhodes of the Road Warriors.
[42:35.330 --> 42:36.070]  Hawk and Animal.
[42:36.070 --> 42:36.950]  Hawk and Animal.
[42:37.130 --> 42:39.250]  So, what I like about Hawk and Animal, if you look at them,
[42:39.610 --> 42:41.570]  they have reverse haircuts.
[42:41.690 --> 42:41.850]  Yeah.
[42:42.510 --> 42:43.670]  Oh, my God, they do.
[42:43.750 --> 42:44.350]  Yeah, isn't that cool?
[42:44.610 --> 42:47.290]  They remind me of the things in Ninja Turtles.
[42:47.930 --> 42:48.290]  They...
[42:49.970 --> 42:50.850]  Bebop and Rocksteady?
[42:50.930 --> 42:51.150]  Yeah.
[42:51.290 --> 42:53.610]  They were Gwar before Gwar.
[42:53.650 --> 42:54.130]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[42:54.570 --> 42:56.290]  They go, ooh, what a rush.
[42:56.610 --> 42:57.810]  What a rush.
[42:57.950 --> 42:58.070]  Yeah.
[42:58.130 --> 42:59.030]  And they had the...
[42:59.030 --> 43:01.210]  They had football pads with spikes on them.
[43:01.390 --> 43:02.310]  And that was just their...
[43:02.310 --> 43:04.270]  Their manager, pretty Paul Elring,
[43:04.270 --> 43:05.270]  and he was just...
[43:05.270 --> 43:06.030]  He was taking care of business.
[43:06.350 --> 43:06.610]  Fucking awesome.
[43:07.370 --> 43:08.150]  Oh, King Haku.
[43:08.390 --> 43:08.810]  All right.
[43:09.390 --> 43:11.110]  Here we have the Mountie.
[43:11.710 --> 43:12.410]  Oh, the Mountie?
[43:12.570 --> 43:13.130]  The Mountie?
[43:13.230 --> 43:14.070]  He always gets his man.
[43:14.950 --> 43:15.510]  Well, he's a Mountie.
[43:15.990 --> 43:16.950]  Oh, dude, another great.
[43:17.170 --> 43:18.010]  The Bushwhackers.
[43:18.070 --> 43:19.790]  Yeah, and the fucking marching.
[43:20.450 --> 43:22.290]  These are all things from our books.
[43:23.030 --> 43:25.270]  Like, these are all in our books.
[43:25.630 --> 43:28.130]  Rowdy Roddy Piper and some pervert.
[43:31.090 --> 43:32.050]  Oh, shit.
[43:32.810 --> 43:34.190]  Look at this.
[43:34.670 --> 43:37.770]  It's the fucking Texas Tornado.
[43:37.770 --> 43:38.510]  Oh, Eric.
[43:39.150 --> 43:39.510]  Eric.
[43:39.830 --> 43:40.190]  Eric.
[43:40.190 --> 43:40.790]  Eric himself.
[43:41.250 --> 43:42.430]  With two good feet.
[43:42.550 --> 43:42.990]  Just kidding.
[43:43.070 --> 43:44.270]  He's missing half of one of them.
[43:44.490 --> 43:44.790]  Yeah.
[43:44.910 --> 43:45.890]  Let's go to sleeve that.
[43:45.990 --> 43:46.410]  You know why?
[43:46.570 --> 43:46.790]  Why?
[43:46.990 --> 43:48.130]  Because he rode a motorcycle drunk.
[43:48.250 --> 43:48.450]  Yeah.
[43:48.650 --> 43:48.990]  Really?
[43:49.410 --> 43:50.450]  Oh, here's Mr. Perfect.
[43:50.630 --> 43:51.210]  Did you not see the movie?
[43:51.570 --> 43:52.030]  What movie?
[43:52.750 --> 43:53.110]  The...
[43:53.110 --> 43:53.710]  The Iron Claw?
[43:53.850 --> 43:55.710]  No, Geoff went and saw it with Millie and not with me.
[43:56.370 --> 43:57.090]  Yeah, it's...
[43:57.090 --> 43:59.230]  And then refuses to go see it again because it's too sad.
[43:59.330 --> 43:59.850]  Oh, it's devastating.
[44:00.010 --> 44:00.290]  I can't.
[44:00.330 --> 44:01.250]  It's a devastating...
[44:01.250 --> 44:01.910]  Saddest fucking thing ever.
[44:01.910 --> 44:03.330]  I'm going to take myself on a sad date.
[44:03.450 --> 44:03.570]  Yeah.
[44:03.690 --> 44:04.450]  I probably wouldn't even cry.
[44:05.310 --> 44:05.830]  You will.
[44:05.930 --> 44:06.290]  I think you will.
[44:07.010 --> 44:07.330]  Hulk Hogan.
[44:07.470 --> 44:07.590]  Yeah.
[44:07.770 --> 44:08.490]  Hey, brother.
[44:08.830 --> 44:09.430]  Took down Gawker.
[44:10.470 --> 44:10.790]  What?
[44:11.270 --> 44:12.010]  Oh, Gawker.
[44:12.470 --> 44:15.130]  His only positive contribution in his life is that he took down...
[44:16.350 --> 44:16.990]  Macho King.
[44:17.050 --> 44:17.670]  Oh, hell yeah.
[44:17.770 --> 44:18.510]  Not the Macho Man.
[44:18.550 --> 44:19.190]  This is the Macho King.
[44:19.190 --> 44:22.870]  This is when he won the King of the Ring and he made everyone call him the Macho King.
[44:23.050 --> 44:23.410]  Hell yeah.
[44:23.450 --> 44:24.990]  Those cards look fucking...
[44:24.990 --> 44:25.890]  Like, put that Macho...
[44:25.890 --> 44:26.970]  The Macho Man down on it.
[44:27.090 --> 44:27.130]  Yeah.
[44:27.510 --> 44:28.190]  So the...
[44:28.190 --> 44:30.110]  The other ones, like those NFL ones...
[44:30.110 --> 44:30.290]  Yeah.
[44:30.290 --> 44:31.770]  They're, like, boring to look at.
[44:31.990 --> 44:32.050]  Yes.
[44:32.310 --> 44:35.330]  Macho Man, they, like, cut out the background.
[44:35.910 --> 44:39.230]  Look, they cut out part of the background, but they kept the background photo.
[44:39.390 --> 44:39.430]  Yes.
[44:39.490 --> 44:43.150]  And then he is on top of the border as well.
[44:43.270 --> 44:44.550]  So what you're mentioning...
[44:44.550 --> 44:45.190]  That's so cool.
[44:45.270 --> 44:47.990]  Is actually something that is an...
[44:47.990 --> 44:50.830]  Like, an industry-wide knock against Panini.
[44:51.710 --> 44:57.170]  People don't like when Panini just Photoshop's the backgrounds into stuff.
[44:57.330 --> 44:59.330]  Like, I just pull the guys out and put them on, like, a cool background.
[45:00.810 --> 45:05.150]  Panini does that with a lot of their cards, and people kind of universally hate it.
[45:05.530 --> 45:08.890]  It's why a lot of people like Topps, because Topps uses real backgrounds and stuff.
[45:09.670 --> 45:10.590]  I didn't know that.
[45:10.710 --> 45:11.650]  I personally haven't...
[45:11.650 --> 45:12.410]  Don't really care one way or the other.
[45:12.510 --> 45:12.910]  That's why we're...
[45:12.910 --> 45:13.910]  I get why people are upset about it.
[45:14.030 --> 45:17.950]  That's why we're a Topps family, because they also make the quality product of Alan Ginter.
[45:17.950 --> 45:18.490]  Alan Ginter?
[45:18.750 --> 45:19.030]  Absolutely.
[45:19.390 --> 45:20.370]  I like Panini, too.
[45:20.470 --> 45:20.990]  We're both family.
[45:21.410 --> 45:22.110]  Okay, here's...
[45:22.770 --> 45:25.210]  There's a hobby pack of Goodwin Champions.
[45:26.210 --> 45:27.890]  This is Upperdeck's version.
[45:28.010 --> 45:28.670]  We've opened these before.
[45:28.670 --> 45:31.770]  This is Upperdeck's version of Alan Ginter.
[45:32.410 --> 45:33.230]  Are you in it?
[45:33.630 --> 45:35.470]  I don't think so, but there could be some weird shit.
[45:35.690 --> 45:38.050]  Somebody email these motherfuckers.
[45:38.070 --> 45:38.250]  Yeah.
[45:38.890 --> 45:39.570]  Tell them.
[45:41.230 --> 45:46.450]  I love how much you love me, but I don't think it's in the cards for me to be in the cards.
[45:46.510 --> 45:47.090]  I get it. Cards.
[45:47.830 --> 45:48.430]  Here we go.
[45:48.510 --> 45:49.790]  Jackson Holliday plays baseball.
[45:50.270 --> 45:52.910]  If you don't get it, then we just continue with life, like normal.
[45:53.350 --> 45:54.430]  Like, it doesn't matter.
[45:54.590 --> 45:55.330]  But I'll be so heartbroken.
[45:55.550 --> 45:56.210]  Darwin Nunes.
[45:56.250 --> 45:58.350]  You won't know, because you won't know that they said no.
[45:58.350 --> 45:59.850]  Hayley Jones, that's true.
[46:00.030 --> 46:01.430]  I don't know who any of these people are.
[46:02.110 --> 46:03.910]  Jackson Holliday is Matt Holliday's kid.
[46:04.170 --> 46:05.450]  And then Jalen Howell.
[46:05.450 --> 46:05.730]  I don't know.
[46:05.930 --> 46:06.670]  These people did stuff.
[46:07.110 --> 46:07.890]  Jalen Howell plays soccer.
[46:08.410 --> 46:08.830]  Is this new?
[46:08.850 --> 46:10.610]  From what year is that photo?
[46:12.650 --> 46:14.030]  If you go, oh yeah, like, 96.
[46:14.410 --> 46:14.750]  2023.
[46:15.310 --> 46:15.610]  Really?
[46:16.850 --> 46:18.030]  Facing visiting... oh, 2022.
[46:18.370 --> 46:24.130]  Facing visiting Uzbekistan, and Howell found the back of the net in the 60s.
[46:24.230 --> 46:26.170]  The quality of photos are the same as these.
[46:26.170 --> 46:29.250]  Yes, the quality of the photo, that looks, that's like not...
[46:29.250 --> 46:30.210]  How does that look better?
[46:32.310 --> 46:37.170]  On the recent episode of Garbage, they were talking about the signs, and they said that
[46:37.170 --> 46:40.170]  their favorite sign was, uh, Vince is a queef.
[46:41.790 --> 46:47.570]  There's one that people found online recently that, uh, it was in the 90s, and it just,
[46:47.690 --> 46:50.630]  I think it was a sign that said, Goldberg eats corn the long way.
[46:50.630 --> 46:55.630]  It's been making me laugh for like six months.
[46:57.190 --> 46:57.830]  Oh, man.
[46:59.230 --> 47:00.590]  All right, let's open up this pack.
[47:00.590 --> 47:01.370]  This is for Emily.
[47:01.470 --> 47:03.090]  This is the Disney Princess Squish.
[47:04.590 --> 47:07.750]  I thought these would be like the LOL dolls, where they...
[47:07.750 --> 47:07.910]  Oh!
[47:10.760 --> 47:11.940]  What are these things you can get?
[47:11.980 --> 47:12.600]  Is there not a paper?
[47:12.860 --> 47:13.620]  There is a paper, sorry.
[47:13.800 --> 47:15.260]  Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[47:15.360 --> 47:17.900]  See, he's like, oh, here's some bullshit for Emily, next.
[47:18.500 --> 47:19.560]  Let me get back into football.
[47:19.840 --> 47:21.160]  I'm not done doing nice shit for you.
[47:22.100 --> 47:23.440]  It's my birthday week.
[47:23.460 --> 47:24.480]  You have to be nice to me.
[47:24.480 --> 47:24.820]  It is her birthday week.
[47:24.820 --> 47:25.340]  Oh, that's right.
[47:25.480 --> 47:25.920]  63.
[47:26.380 --> 47:27.100]  Isn't that amazing?
[47:27.220 --> 47:29.320]  Thank God I got my Botox touched up today.
[47:29.500 --> 47:29.660]  Woo!
[47:30.620 --> 47:38.060]  Ariel, Aurora, Belle, Jasmine, Moana, Mulan, Tiana, and Rapunzel.
[47:38.340 --> 47:38.520]  Nice.
[47:38.660 --> 47:41.000]  One of them should be the chameleon from Rapunzel.
[47:41.720 --> 47:42.160]  I'm excited.
[47:42.560 --> 47:44.760]  They redid Splash Mountain to be Tiana.
[47:44.880 --> 47:45.760]  Careful with your neck.
[47:48.200 --> 47:49.620]  It's hard holding up the crown.
[47:49.620 --> 47:50.760]  I guess so.
[47:51.880 --> 47:54.740]  Emily, he's not going to love this, but you are.
[47:54.880 --> 47:55.220]  What do we got?
[47:55.540 --> 47:56.120]  Look what I found.
[47:57.480 --> 47:59.660]  Got a pack of Dallas cards.
[47:59.940 --> 48:00.480]  Here's the thing.
[48:00.720 --> 48:02.440]  Everyone sat through my wrestling cards.
[48:02.580 --> 48:04.000]  We can sit through one pack of Dallas.
[48:05.720 --> 48:06.320]  I regret.
[48:07.040 --> 48:07.940]  Who's card won?
[48:08.680 --> 48:10.420]  Tell us about him.
[48:10.420 --> 48:15.380]  He used to bang Lucy when she was younger and then realized that it's actually his half niece.
[48:16.520 --> 48:17.000]  What?!
[48:17.000 --> 48:21.540]  But now they're older and he's married to Donna and they're fine and he's great.
[48:21.580 --> 48:22.460]  Yeah, he's a sweet dude.
[48:22.540 --> 48:23.200]  What the fuck?
[48:23.240 --> 48:26.380]  And he pulled the plug on Mickey, his nephew.
[48:26.820 --> 48:30.260]  Yeah, he did pull the plug in the hospital on his nephew and was up on murder charges for it.
[48:31.520 --> 48:32.880]  There we have the boys.
[48:33.640 --> 48:34.720]  That's the whole fam.
[48:35.180 --> 48:37.260]  So that's the guy from the card before.
[48:37.980 --> 48:41.420]  And these are all like, that's Bobby, that's JR, that's Jack.
[48:41.840 --> 48:43.680]  And then they're probably, I don't know, finding out about some bullshit.
[48:43.680 --> 48:47.780]  And he's their brother and his illegitimate son, but they don't know this yet.
[48:47.840 --> 48:48.660]  Yeah, they don't know this yet.
[48:48.680 --> 48:50.080]  They just think he's a ranch hand right now.
[48:50.760 --> 48:52.500]  Oh, here we go.
[48:52.740 --> 48:53.940]  There is...
[48:53.940 --> 48:55.360]  This is when Pamela got that baby.
[48:55.580 --> 48:56.280]  No, no, no.
[48:56.460 --> 48:57.160]  That's Pamela.
[48:57.280 --> 48:57.940]  Sorry, I was trying to help.
[48:57.940 --> 48:59.380]  That's Pamela and Miss Ellie.
[48:59.600 --> 49:01.920]  That's Jax, that's Mama and then...
[49:01.920 --> 49:02.300]  Married.
[49:02.580 --> 49:02.820]  Married.
[49:02.860 --> 49:04.080]  Currently, well...
[49:04.080 --> 49:06.940]  Well, later in later seasons, Pamela and Bobby divorce.
[49:07.220 --> 49:09.240]  Pamela lost her fucking mind is what happened.
[49:09.280 --> 49:09.580]  Yeah, that's tough.
[49:09.800 --> 49:11.680]  Listen, I'm sorry, I'm not...
[49:12.140 --> 49:14.600]  They needed to bring in Priscilla Presley somehow.
[49:15.280 --> 49:17.740]  So they just made Pamela go off the fucking deep end.
[49:17.820 --> 49:18.620]  It made no goddamn sense.
[49:18.840 --> 49:20.700]  Speaking of deep end, there's fucking J.R. Ewan.
[49:20.880 --> 49:21.760]  Yeah, he's making a business deal.
[49:21.760 --> 49:22.640]  Putting the strain on that desk.
[49:24.740 --> 49:26.400]  Here we have the brothers again.
[49:26.580 --> 49:28.660]  They always got along, even before they knew they were brothers.
[49:28.740 --> 49:32.060]  Well, Bobby is definitely the level-headed one of the family.
[49:32.260 --> 49:36.040]  Like, he's the good, but he's also a dumbass, too.
[49:36.060 --> 49:37.120]  Yeah, that sounds right.
[49:37.940 --> 49:39.580]  Oh, there's J.R.
[49:39.840 --> 49:40.240]  That's J.R.
[49:40.240 --> 49:41.340]  He's got his morning robe on.
[49:41.460 --> 49:43.020]  They take their breakfast outside.
[49:43.040 --> 49:43.740]  Good ol' J.R.
[49:43.760 --> 49:46.040]  We gotta do that. We need to start doing outside breakfast, dude.
[49:46.200 --> 49:50.320]  I think that that might be while he's healing from being shot, but he's still calling the shots.
[49:50.960 --> 49:51.960]  Oh, that's fun.
[49:52.180 --> 49:52.560]  Boom!
[49:55.380 --> 49:56.900]  I love you, Sue Ellen.
[49:57.020 --> 49:57.720]  Love you, Sue Ellen.
[49:57.740 --> 49:59.660]  Sue Ellen, on-card auto.
[50:02.000 --> 50:08.220]  When Emily and I got married recently, she got me a cameo from this lady.
[50:08.480 --> 50:09.020]  From Sue Ellen.
[50:09.860 --> 50:11.820]  And she still looks so good.
[50:12.100 --> 50:13.340]  She had lots of great advice, too.
[50:13.340 --> 50:14.220]  She was really sweet.
[50:15.140 --> 50:16.300]  We're getting on the time, man.
[50:16.360 --> 50:17.360]  We're getting on the time, so let's do this.
[50:17.440 --> 50:19.920]  We'll open up some of this year's top stadium.
[50:20.000 --> 50:20.960]  We're gonna call this...
[50:21.900 --> 50:23.440]  We're gonna call this Generations.
[50:23.580 --> 50:25.340]  This segment is called Generations.
[50:27.040 --> 50:28.640]  Play the Generations intro.
[50:28.860 --> 50:29.720]  Emily, hit some sound effects.
[50:32.140 --> 50:34.060]  Did you say I'm dropping the ball on the sounds?
[50:39.020 --> 50:40.120]  Do you have a ball-dropping sound?
[50:43.600 --> 50:44.100]  Let's see.
[50:44.280 --> 50:46.220]  Do you have to put any of these packs in the sack-pack-pack sack?
[50:46.360 --> 50:46.600]  Yeah, I will.
[50:47.160 --> 50:49.480]  Oh, that's a new one for me.
[50:49.860 --> 50:50.620]  That was pathetic.
[50:52.600 --> 50:54.840]  So this is what... this is second series, but...
[50:54.840 --> 50:55.880]  Stadium Club launched in 1991.
[50:56.160 --> 50:57.280]  This is what they looked like then.
[50:58.040 --> 50:59.400]  This is Stadium Club in 2023.
[50:59.480 --> 50:59.860]  Very different.
[51:00.160 --> 51:00.840]  This is very different.
[51:00.920 --> 51:02.040]  Let's see what they look like.
[51:02.100 --> 51:03.640]  You wanna go old and new?
[51:03.820 --> 51:04.120]  Let's do...
[51:04.560 --> 51:05.080]  We'll do old.
[51:05.220 --> 51:07.660]  A little old style, and then new stylies.
[51:07.660 --> 51:09.820]  This one is used Kodak film.
[51:10.740 --> 51:11.640]  No fucking way.
[51:11.960 --> 51:12.860]  Somebody tell Wes.
[51:13.880 --> 51:15.200]  I'm like, oh, I could use it.
[51:15.400 --> 51:16.280]  All right, here we go.
[51:16.480 --> 51:16.620]  What we got, buddy?
[51:17.280 --> 51:21.900]  These were the first, like, baseball cards that came out that were, like, super high class.
[51:22.040 --> 51:25.140]  Upper Deck came out the year before this, but these are the ones that were, like, it was a big deal.
[51:25.260 --> 51:26.460]  They were, like, photographer.
[51:26.960 --> 51:27.180]  Huh.
[51:28.320 --> 51:29.360]  Like, art photography.
[51:29.820 --> 51:30.620]  Geoff Blauser.
[51:30.820 --> 51:31.940]  That was Kent Merker a second ago.
[51:32.280 --> 51:32.820]  Raphael Palmeiro.
[51:34.020 --> 51:34.640]  Texas Ranger.
[51:34.760 --> 51:35.120]  Great.
[51:35.800 --> 51:36.660]  Here we have...
[51:36.660 --> 51:37.380]  Disgraced.
[51:37.680 --> 51:38.600]  Craig Rabeck.
[51:38.980 --> 51:39.820]  Pedro Munoz.
[51:41.240 --> 51:42.900]  Ooh, Bill Swift.
[51:43.720 --> 51:45.840]  Here we have Steve Lake.
[51:46.120 --> 51:47.640]  That photo looks way older than...
[51:47.640 --> 51:49.040]  Yeah, it's not...
[51:49.040 --> 51:49.780]  Wow.
[51:50.000 --> 51:50.780]  Hal Morris.
[51:52.840 --> 51:53.400]  Uh...
[51:53.400 --> 51:54.660]  Chris Nabholz.
[51:55.420 --> 51:55.700]  What?
[51:55.960 --> 51:56.680]  Look at his face, though.
[51:57.040 --> 51:57.600]  What?
[51:59.480 --> 52:04.960]  He looks like a character actor who would play a baseball player who just came from the farm.
[52:05.260 --> 52:05.460]  Yeah.
[52:05.940 --> 52:07.320]  Oh, God, that's so bad.
[52:07.320 --> 52:08.440]  He looks like Kenneth from 30 Rock.
[52:09.640 --> 52:10.360]  Mike Pagliarolo.
[52:11.360 --> 52:12.080]  Bill Wegman.
[52:13.200 --> 52:14.240]  And, oh, there you go.
[52:14.320 --> 52:15.120]  Little Tony Gwynn, actually.
[52:15.120 --> 52:15.420]  Hey!
[52:15.460 --> 52:16.740]  Beautiful picture of Tony Gwynn there.
[52:16.760 --> 52:17.080]  Beautiful.
[52:17.620 --> 52:18.560]  What year are these cards?
[52:18.580 --> 52:18.940]  1991.
[52:19.600 --> 52:20.580]  That can go into Good Smile.
[52:20.620 --> 52:21.000]  There you go.
[52:21.020 --> 52:21.220]  Nice.
[52:21.500 --> 52:22.400]  Just leave that puppy.
[52:22.740 --> 52:24.720]  And then, now, let's see what 2023 looks like.
[52:24.720 --> 52:24.960]  Cool.
[52:25.100 --> 52:26.400]  We get a Tony Gwynn card in that one, too.
[52:27.020 --> 52:27.720]  It's possible.
[52:29.120 --> 52:30.180]  Uh, let's see.
[52:30.400 --> 52:30.760]  Ooh.
[52:32.040 --> 52:32.760]  Logan Webb.
[52:34.340 --> 52:35.220]  Wow, he's a giant.
[52:35.360 --> 52:36.200]  Oh, look at that.
[52:36.300 --> 52:37.000]  Greg Maddox.
[52:37.180 --> 52:37.320]  Okay.
[52:37.460 --> 52:38.100]  Oh, that's weird.
[52:38.160 --> 52:39.200]  He's with the Braves!
[52:41.000 --> 52:42.880]  Uh, Andrew Benatendi.
[52:44.600 --> 52:45.400]  Jonathan India.
[52:46.000 --> 52:46.300]  Wow.
[52:46.600 --> 52:47.120]  Aren't these pretty?
[52:47.780 --> 52:48.140]  Yeah.
[52:48.400 --> 52:49.720]  Oh, here we go.
[52:50.620 --> 52:51.420]  Andre Dawson.
[52:51.620 --> 52:52.960]  Oh, fuck, yeah.
[52:53.420 --> 52:53.940]  That's a cool one.
[52:54.080 --> 52:54.340]  That's a great card.
[52:54.360 --> 52:54.940]  That's a great photo.
[52:55.080 --> 52:56.400]  It looks like the guy from ER.
[52:58.200 --> 52:58.980]  Shane Bieber.
[52:59.500 --> 52:59.820]  There you go.
[53:00.220 --> 53:02.080]  Did you guys see that thing about Justin Bieber in hockey?
[53:02.980 --> 53:03.360]  What's that?
[53:03.540 --> 53:03.880]  He likes hockey.
[53:03.880 --> 53:06.980]  Apparently, he played at the All-Star game in a thing, and he was really good.
[53:07.080 --> 53:08.140]  He's fucking Canadian.
[53:08.280 --> 53:09.380]  Yeah, but, like, really good.
[53:09.440 --> 53:13.220]  Now, he's been offered a one-year tryout by two different teams to play.
[53:13.320 --> 53:13.720]  Yeah, why not?
[53:13.840 --> 53:15.420]  Why would you not offer Justin Bieber?
[53:15.480 --> 53:15.840]  It's crazy.
[53:16.160 --> 53:17.660]  Yeah, he's, like, not bad.
[53:17.920 --> 53:18.580]  Jack Flaherty.
[53:19.100 --> 53:19.420]  I don't know.
[53:19.480 --> 53:23.800]  It would be like a minor league team having, uh, what's his fucking name?
[53:23.840 --> 53:27.960]  Tiger Blood fucking Charlie Sheen, offering him, like, a minor league contract.
[53:28.120 --> 53:30.200]  It's like, well, yeah, he could throw an 88-mile-an-hour fastball.
[53:30.200 --> 53:30.920]  That'd be nice.
[53:31.000 --> 53:31.280]  Yeah.
[53:33.240 --> 53:35.360]  Uh, we just got a... we just got something.
[53:35.560 --> 53:35.880]  What'd we get?
[53:35.880 --> 53:36.760]  We haven't got a hit in a while.
[53:36.940 --> 53:37.560]  What'd we get?
[53:37.840 --> 53:44.380]  We got a redemption for a Going Yard autographed Orange Parallel.
[53:44.380 --> 53:44.980]  No way!
[53:45.740 --> 53:46.260]  Who's that?
[53:46.620 --> 53:50.380]  Uh, he's a very, very, very good player for the Houston Astros.
[53:50.420 --> 53:51.440]  You have to send...
[53:51.440 --> 53:51.720]  Huge card.
[53:51.720 --> 53:53.080]  What do we do, we send away for it?
[53:53.120 --> 53:56.260]  Yeah, uh, there's a... I'll do it on the Topps app.
[53:56.480 --> 53:58.240]  Dude, that's fucking awesome!
[53:58.320 --> 53:59.000]  Yeah, that's very cool.
[53:59.000 --> 54:00.240]  That's a really big hit.
[54:00.300 --> 54:03.020]  You need to... you need to get it, get it graded, and bring it in?
[54:03.120 --> 54:03.200]  Yeah.
[54:03.200 --> 54:05.060]  Because that's... that's a big hit.
[54:05.140 --> 54:06.860]  We'll put that... that'll go up in the... behind us in the wall.
[54:06.900 --> 54:10.280]  Jordan Alvarez hits fucking bombs, too.
[54:10.280 --> 54:11.640]  Yeah, he's a bomb... he's a bomb hitter.
[54:11.700 --> 54:12.120]  That rocks, dude.
[54:12.120 --> 54:12.200]  Really?
[54:12.540 --> 54:13.220]  I'll take care of that tonight.
[54:13.280 --> 54:14.180]  That's fucking awesome.
[54:14.180 --> 54:15.340]  That's a cool-ass get.
[54:15.660 --> 54:15.940]  Yeah.
[54:16.120 --> 54:20.040]  Dude, so far, the Generation segment is the top segment, dude.
[54:20.140 --> 54:20.720]  That's a great one.
[54:21.160 --> 54:21.700]  I feel like...
[54:21.700 --> 54:22.720]  Are we going... are we going right to it?
[54:22.720 --> 54:25.700]  All right, let's do one more old, one more new, and then we'll switch.
[54:25.760 --> 54:27.640]  One more in our Generation segment.
[54:27.640 --> 54:30.520]  I just feel like it's going to be a letdown after the Jordan Alvarez auto.
[54:31.520 --> 54:33.440]  I don't ever get good player autos.
[54:33.460 --> 54:34.440]  That's fucking crazy.
[54:34.980 --> 54:39.180]  The last time we got a good auto on this break show was probably the Johnny Bench when we got in Episode 2.
[54:41.440 --> 54:42.240]  Roger McDowell.
[54:42.500 --> 54:42.620]  Okay.
[54:42.960 --> 54:43.420]  I thought it was a...
[54:43.420 --> 54:44.380]  That old Phillies look.
[54:44.520 --> 54:45.860]  Dave Gallagher.
[54:46.560 --> 54:47.300]  Old Angels look.
[54:47.320 --> 54:48.660]  Ooh, Pedro Guerrero.
[54:48.840 --> 54:49.420]  I remember him.
[54:50.460 --> 54:51.260]  Ray Lankford.
[54:52.200 --> 54:53.000]  Ron Hasse.
[54:53.840 --> 54:55.640]  Here we have Willie McGee.
[54:55.800 --> 54:56.320]  Great player.
[54:57.740 --> 54:58.540]  Alan Mills.
[54:58.940 --> 54:59.700]  Pat Kelly.
[55:00.040 --> 55:01.920]  They both... you can tell they had their photos taken.
[55:01.920 --> 55:02.640]  They were right next to each other.
[55:02.760 --> 55:03.440]  20 seconds apart.
[55:05.760 --> 55:09.080]  That's because they didn't have a camera before to fix the eyeline.
[55:09.520 --> 55:11.020]  Fix the shadow on the baseball cap.
[55:12.300 --> 55:13.100]  Paul Fares.
[55:13.600 --> 55:14.360]  Ooh, a checklist.
[55:14.520 --> 55:15.400]  So you know what's in the set.
[55:15.720 --> 55:20.380]  And then Rob Patterson and Pete Smith.
[55:21.480 --> 55:22.420]  Not a lot of...
[55:23.420 --> 55:24.180]  No big hits.
[55:24.460 --> 55:25.420]  No Jordan Alvarez...
[55:26.980 --> 55:27.900]  ...fucking autograph.
[55:28.040 --> 55:28.900]  That's for sure.
[55:29.020 --> 55:30.880]  Let's see what we've got here.
[55:33.640 --> 55:36.860]  I wanted to see Justin Bieber get checked in the open eyes.
[55:38.400 --> 55:39.080]  You know what's gonna happen.
[55:39.460 --> 55:40.340]  Geoff Bagel.
[55:40.620 --> 55:41.040]  Hell yeah.
[55:41.280 --> 55:42.760]  Speak of the devil, here's...
[55:42.760 --> 55:44.300]  Oh, this is Yadier Molina.
[55:44.400 --> 55:44.820]  Yadi.
[55:46.140 --> 55:47.060]  Willie Mays.
[55:47.640 --> 55:49.760]  Oh, man, that's a cool fucking card.
[55:50.380 --> 55:51.580]  These cards are awesome.
[55:51.600 --> 55:52.240]  They are very nice.
[55:52.340 --> 55:52.940]  Reese Hoskins.
[55:53.740 --> 55:54.460]  You're gonna love this one.
[55:54.460 --> 55:56.660]  That's him hitting that home run, fucking slamming the bat down.
[55:56.760 --> 55:57.720]  That moment was so cool.
[55:57.800 --> 55:58.140]  That was cool.
[55:58.220 --> 55:58.900]  That was awesome.
[55:59.680 --> 56:00.800]  Randy Johnson, big unit.
[56:00.820 --> 56:02.000]  Oh, the big unit.
[56:02.980 --> 56:03.940]  He's throwing that ball.
[56:04.000 --> 56:04.740]  It's about to hit that bird.
[56:04.780 --> 56:05.480]  It's gonna explode.
[56:07.120 --> 56:08.820]  Did he play basketball ever?
[56:08.980 --> 56:09.520]  Six foot ten?
[56:09.660 --> 56:11.960]  No, he's like a photographer now, isn't he?
[56:12.080 --> 56:12.760]  Does he take pictures?
[56:13.020 --> 56:15.100]  Mark McGuire, looks like he's hanging out with Will Clark there.
[56:15.160 --> 56:15.860]  Probably at an All-Star game maybe.
[56:15.860 --> 56:17.540]  That was before he had worms, huh?
[56:17.700 --> 56:17.980]  Yeah.
[56:19.020 --> 56:20.380]  He had worms there.
[56:20.560 --> 56:21.660]  He's probably right at the beginning of worms.
[56:21.800 --> 56:22.680]  He's starting to get some worms.
[56:22.760 --> 56:23.160]  Recently infected.
[56:23.160 --> 56:24.640]  He's probably worming a little bit.
[56:24.640 --> 56:25.700]  Tristan Casas, Ricky.
[56:26.140 --> 56:31.660]  And then an orange-numbered Ken Griffey Jr.
[56:32.240 --> 56:33.180]  Parallel, the kid.
[56:33.620 --> 56:35.900]  Looks like it has a fucking scan line on it, which sucks.
[56:36.060 --> 56:37.620]  But it's numbered to 199.
[56:37.920 --> 56:38.400]  Oh, that's neat.
[56:38.480 --> 56:40.560]  Which is probably gonna be worth some money.
[56:40.660 --> 56:41.740]  So let's go ahead and sleeve these.
[56:41.880 --> 56:42.880]  If you could sleeve the...
[56:42.880 --> 56:46.240]  Didn't Gavin film a slow-mo thing with Ken Griffey Jr.?
[56:46.240 --> 56:46.820]  Did he really?
[56:47.060 --> 56:47.620]  I think so.
[56:47.660 --> 56:48.220]  I thought he did.
[56:48.360 --> 56:51.800]  Because I think my friend PA'd for that back in San Diego.
[56:51.820 --> 56:53.060]  I don't see a scan line.
[56:53.060 --> 56:54.620]  It's like right here, you can see.
[56:54.780 --> 56:56.380]  It's like a white line kind of going down.
[56:56.760 --> 56:57.460]  White lines.
[56:58.320 --> 56:59.620]  Open the Kirby pocket, baseball.
[56:59.620 --> 57:00.440]  I need glasses.
[57:00.960 --> 57:01.660]  White lines.
[57:01.840 --> 57:04.880]  Yeah, it's right here across the center of his forehead, right there.
[57:04.960 --> 57:05.560]  You can see it.
[57:05.620 --> 57:06.740]  Oh, yeah, man.
[57:07.280 --> 57:09.580]  I didn't bring my glasses.
[57:10.760 --> 57:13.000]  They'll definitely notice it when you go to get a grade.
[57:13.040 --> 57:13.360]  Yeah.
[57:13.720 --> 57:14.640]  Yeah, it's...
[57:14.640 --> 57:15.100]  There you go.
[57:15.300 --> 57:16.540]  All right, open up your baseball.
[57:16.920 --> 57:17.720]  Here we go.
[57:18.160 --> 57:20.920]  We got our TriStar Hidden Treasures.
[57:21.020 --> 57:22.720]  I'm really excited to look at the autograph.
[57:22.720 --> 57:24.700]  Not know who it is.
[57:24.940 --> 57:27.400]  Emily, look at what it is, and then we try to figure it out.
[57:27.460 --> 57:30.100]  I think it's going to be Hank Aaron, because we've gotten a lot of Hank Aaron stuff today.
[57:30.100 --> 57:30.860]  That's pretty interesting.
[57:30.960 --> 57:31.460]  I like that.
[57:31.540 --> 57:32.340]  Who do you think it's going to be?
[57:33.360 --> 57:35.520]  A kid that got signed four years ago we've never heard of.
[57:36.860 --> 57:37.180]  Ooh.
[57:37.740 --> 57:38.800]  Don't look at the name in the...
[57:38.800 --> 57:42.020]  I think it's going to be a Hall of Famer I've never heard of.
[57:42.040 --> 57:42.520]  That's a cute package.
[57:42.780 --> 57:42.940]  There you go.
[57:43.880 --> 57:45.100]  Okay, so don't let us...
[57:45.100 --> 57:45.920]  Is there a name in there or no?
[57:45.980 --> 57:46.740]  Not that I see.
[57:46.820 --> 57:47.080]  Okay, cool.
[57:47.300 --> 57:47.860]  Just wait.
[57:49.160 --> 57:50.040]  It's probably in here.
[57:50.200 --> 57:51.240]  There's some paperwork in here.
[57:51.240 --> 57:53.080]  Probably a certificate of authenticity.
[57:53.380 --> 57:53.960]  Okay, let's see.
[57:54.000 --> 57:54.520]  Oh, here we go.
[57:54.780 --> 57:55.140]  Okay.
[57:55.500 --> 57:57.160]  We got...
[57:57.160 --> 57:58.120]  I think it's...
[57:58.120 --> 57:59.180]  Okay, tilt it a little bit more.
[57:59.340 --> 57:59.940]  I can't see it.
[58:04.300 --> 58:05.020]  Benito Santiago.
[58:05.760 --> 58:07.400]  Dude, it looks like Benito Santiago.
[58:07.700 --> 58:08.100]  It does, right?
[58:08.260 --> 58:09.040]  Is that y'all's final answer?
[58:09.040 --> 58:10.120]  Yeah, that's my guess.
[58:10.220 --> 58:10.900]  I think it's...
[58:12.380 --> 58:12.740]  Man.
[58:13.620 --> 58:13.980]  Cespedes?
[58:14.520 --> 58:14.880]  Cespedes?
[58:14.900 --> 58:15.720]  No, those are Zs.
[58:15.860 --> 58:17.300]  It's Reggie Jackson.
[58:17.440 --> 58:17.740]  Yes.
[58:18.140 --> 58:18.540]  Is it really?
[58:18.540 --> 58:19.740]  14-time All-Stars.
[58:20.760 --> 58:21.780]  1973 AL MVP.
