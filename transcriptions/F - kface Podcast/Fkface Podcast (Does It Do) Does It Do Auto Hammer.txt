[00:00.000 --> 00:02.880]  This season of Does It Do, sponsored by Shady Rays!
[00:06.960 --> 00:08.580]  Do you want to lie down for a bit?
[00:09.300 --> 00:12.380]  Auto hammer. Hammers automatically. It's like a robot hammer.
[00:12.820 --> 00:13.860]  It hammers automatically?
[00:14.300 --> 00:16.660]  We'll find out on Does It Do.
[00:19.360 --> 00:24.500]  Hey, welcome to Does It Do. My name is Geoff and with me, as always, my partner Gavin.
[00:24.660 --> 00:29.720]  We work for Unifarm. Unifarm, combining the power of one with the fabric of the farm uniform.
[00:29.720 --> 00:34.300]  And our job at the company is to take a look at the products that you may see on television,
[00:34.440 --> 00:36.320]  on social media, on the internet, that seem...
[00:39.260 --> 00:41.740]  seem too good to be true. We'll find out.
[00:42.440 --> 00:45.980]  Does it auto hammer? Does it do that or does it do something else?
[00:46.080 --> 00:48.120]  We find out using the principles...
[00:49.520 --> 00:54.280]  Yes, that's right. We find out the why, the how, and the what does it do.
[00:57.580 --> 00:59.940]  Do they have to be in any specific orientation?
[01:01.300 --> 01:01.960]  They're good now.
[01:02.580 --> 01:04.200]  Press button to release nail.
[01:05.580 --> 01:08.060]  They're just falling out. I think you've put them in wrong.
[01:13.340 --> 01:17.120]  Loading. Before loading nails, please use the nail guide.
[01:17.540 --> 01:18.680]  Nah, we didn't use the nail guide.
[01:19.240 --> 01:21.660]  Next, be sure to load nails head first into chamber.
[01:23.540 --> 01:24.020]  Oh!
[01:24.020 --> 01:25.160]  Oh my god!
[01:27.280 --> 01:29.860]  Well, we've got gloves, first of all.
[01:38.230 --> 01:43.070]  Maybe it's an American hammer. Maybe it doesn't work with British metrics.
[01:43.390 --> 01:45.410]  All right, there we go. So I just hammer this guy in.
[01:46.090 --> 01:46.810]  That bit's great.
[01:49.370 --> 01:54.210]  Always hold the hammer at a 45 degree angle. So you just got to walk around with it like this
[01:54.210 --> 01:58.910]  at all times while holding the press button. You did that. Oh, that's nuts everywhere.
[01:59.550 --> 02:04.490]  Uh, setting the nail is easy and fast once you use the upward hammering motion.
[02:05.290 --> 02:08.910]  It's just like the upward hammering motion is the way every human being has ever hammered.
[02:08.970 --> 02:09.550]  I don't know if you can tell.
[02:11.990 --> 02:14.350]  Nail release. No, we already did.
[02:15.410 --> 02:19.850]  Should your auto hammer malfunction? Yeah, we're into that territory.
[02:21.010 --> 02:24.370]  Uh, that bit works great. But how do you let it...
[02:26.230 --> 02:30.750]  ...once the nail is set, proceed to hammer as usual.
[02:37.570 --> 02:42.390]  So I thought, I thought it was, first off, I thought it wasn't,
[02:42.670 --> 02:47.270]  it's the name auto hammer is really misleading. I thought it was going to like hammer for us.
[02:47.450 --> 02:49.890]  But what we're doing is we're solving for this.
[02:51.150 --> 02:54.170]  You don't want to do that anymore. No, I do that when you can do this.
[02:59.250 --> 03:01.970]  Maybe it's better on wolves. Here's what we'll do.
[03:02.330 --> 03:09.570]  There's your piece. I'll use a regular hammer and you use the auto hammer and we'll see.
[03:10.470 --> 03:14.070]  Damn it. We'll see who can hammer a nail faster.
[03:14.490 --> 03:18.370]  Are you ready? You mark, get set, go.
[03:31.130 --> 03:35.550]  Okay, I did it in 12 seconds and, uh, 12 point, 12 and a half seconds.
[03:35.550 --> 03:39.330]  See what happened to me there? I ran out of nails, so we'll have to go again.
[03:39.450 --> 03:51.970]  Go. I did it in 10 seconds that time.
[03:52.350 --> 03:54.750]  It just eats itself. You want to flip?
[03:54.930 --> 04:00.170]  Does it do season two made possible by our friends at Shady Rays.
[04:00.570 --> 04:06.750]  Shady Rays is an independent sunglass brand that has over 250,000 five star reviews.

[05:18.470 --> 05:19.650]  This is what they look like.
[05:20.590 --> 05:21.410]  You want a hammer?
[05:29.200 --> 05:29.720]  Go.
[05:31.760 --> 05:32.680]  Why do I have two?
[05:42.100 --> 05:45.500]  I got two in the chamber somehow and they're coming out the bottom.
[05:47.100 --> 05:48.560]  I mean, it works as a hammer.
[05:49.200 --> 05:49.740]  Does it?
[05:50.760 --> 05:55.260]  Do you think it's solid enough to hammer a nail all the way in in one motion?
[05:58.320 --> 05:59.440]  Practice. Practice it.
[06:01.040 --> 06:01.380]  Well good.
[06:06.270 --> 06:06.630]  Yeah.
[06:07.890 --> 06:09.090]  All right, now I'll try with the regular.
[06:13.960 --> 06:15.100]  Accuracy is a problem for me.
[06:51.340 --> 06:53.620]  Do you think we could hang an egg on the wall?
[06:55.880 --> 06:56.240]  Ready?
[06:56.600 --> 06:57.320]  Yeah, but don't kill me.
[07:01.560 --> 07:04.340]  You see stuff on TikTok, you think it works, it doesn't.
[07:07.180 --> 07:07.780]  Pretzel stick?
[07:08.180 --> 07:11.360]  You want a snack but your foreman's a kind of a jerk.
[07:11.620 --> 07:12.880]  He doesn't want you breaking to eat.
[07:13.320 --> 07:17.160]  So every once in a while you slip a couple of pretzels in and they pop.
[07:18.240 --> 07:18.940]  Slip a couple.
[07:20.100 --> 07:20.800]  Slip a couple.
[07:21.360 --> 07:22.700]  I mean, you could easily just...
[07:22.700 --> 07:23.640]  Slip a couple pretzels.
[07:24.240 --> 07:26.640]  Dispense one, you know, stealthily from the bottom.
[07:28.620 --> 07:29.520]  Your boss isn't looking.
[07:30.080 --> 07:30.860]  Secret compartment.
[07:31.900 --> 07:33.280]  That's where you stash your pretzels.
[07:34.100 --> 07:35.540]  Oh, we got pretzels jammed in there.
[07:35.980 --> 07:37.400]  What if we make it automatic?
[07:38.040 --> 07:40.400]  This might be saving the auto hammer.
[07:40.620 --> 07:41.160]  Yeah, that's good.
[07:42.740 --> 07:45.440]  Okay, well, all right, let's try that again.
[07:46.760 --> 07:47.060]  Yeah.
[07:48.440 --> 07:49.680]  Your taping skills...
[07:52.060 --> 07:54.460]  We're gonna have to have remedial tape class after this.
[07:54.840 --> 07:56.970]  All right, and then we need to make sure it's got a good...
[08:01.670 --> 08:03.350]  Well, hang on, we need it on drill.
[08:04.670 --> 08:05.130]  There we go.
[08:07.830 --> 08:08.650]  That doesn't do anything.
[08:14.210 --> 08:16.430]  I'll just slap this bad boy right in there.
[08:18.290 --> 08:20.610]  Yeah, we might need a bit more joining tape.
[08:28.490 --> 08:30.830]  I've never seen somebody cut scissors like they were scared of scissors.
[08:31.950 --> 08:32.590]  That's sharp.
[08:35.850 --> 08:36.670]  That's got some...
[08:36.670 --> 08:37.630]  That's got some beans.
[08:37.950 --> 08:38.490]  Give me a nail.
[08:39.670 --> 08:40.290]  Auto hammer.
[08:42.830 --> 08:44.430]  Oh, Jesus, might need...
[08:45.850 --> 08:47.390]  Might need less beans on that one.
[08:47.990 --> 08:49.290]  I would need a new tape job, I think.
[08:50.150 --> 08:51.470]  That almost went to the moon.
[08:53.510 --> 08:54.830]  All right, we're refining it though.
[08:55.190 --> 08:56.170]  Okay, you think like that.
[08:57.530 --> 08:58.370]  Choke up on it, that's a good call.
[08:58.470 --> 08:58.830]  Choke up on it.
[08:59.010 --> 08:59.630]  The hell does that mean?
[08:59.750 --> 09:00.330]  You don't play baseball.
[09:00.470 --> 09:00.530]  Here.
[09:00.950 --> 09:01.710]  About there.
[09:02.550 --> 09:03.070]  There we go.
[09:03.410 --> 09:08.590]  See, the problem is, is that you've taped it to the clutch, so it's moving the mode.
[09:09.990 --> 09:10.450]  Oh!
[09:13.590 --> 09:15.250]  Close, let's see if you can get it all the way in.
[09:17.550 --> 09:18.650]  You're getting so close.
[09:21.090 --> 09:21.930]  Oh, God.
[09:28.920 --> 09:29.840]  You're just missing.
[09:34.340 --> 09:34.800]  Well...
[09:41.550 --> 09:44.030]  It's changing down every time you press it.
[09:44.270 --> 09:45.450]  It's getting weaker and weaker.
[09:48.500 --> 09:51.800]  Okay, well, let's have one more attempt, because we'll solve two problems here.
[09:51.980 --> 09:53.280]  One, it won't hit the battery.
[09:53.500 --> 09:53.700]  Yeah.
[09:53.760 --> 09:55.140]  And it won't change the number.
[09:55.440 --> 09:56.200]  Okay, one more time.
[10:00.200 --> 10:01.160]  Jesus Christ!
[10:03.320 --> 10:04.080]  All right.
[10:04.160 --> 10:05.680]  Now, that's a freaking auto hammer.
[10:06.460 --> 10:07.480]  We did it.
[10:08.100 --> 10:08.700]  Did we?
[10:10.200 --> 10:12.640]  Ah, I almost broke my wrist.
[10:12.920 --> 10:13.960]  It's got some real heft.
[10:16.340 --> 10:17.780]  Pretty good at that speed.
[10:19.560 --> 10:20.500]  Come on, boy!
[10:24.700 --> 10:26.460]  None of that felt safe.
[10:27.320 --> 10:29.520]  Maybe the world's not ready for a true auto hammer.
[10:29.560 --> 10:30.260]  I don't think so.
[10:30.700 --> 10:32.640]  But I'd say combined, that works.
[10:33.040 --> 10:34.180]  That's destined for a hit.
[10:34.380 --> 10:35.040]  Are you kidding?
[10:35.640 --> 10:36.810]  With a lot of help...
[10:36.810 --> 10:39.110]  I guess it does.
[10:39.250 --> 10:40.010]  Yeah, it does.
[10:40.310 --> 10:41.170]  You want to put it in the Hall of Do?
[10:41.310 --> 10:42.590]  Yeah, go for it.
[10:43.310 --> 10:44.630]  This is definitely your product.
[10:44.930 --> 10:45.550]  All right.
[10:52.210 --> 10:53.550]  Hey, you want to put it in the Hall of Do?
[11:01.020 --> 11:04.300]  All right, well, we'll see you next week for another episode of Does It Do?
[11:04.640 --> 11:05.580]  But it's not on next week.
[11:06.580 --> 11:07.660]  Thanks for watching Does It Do?
[11:07.720 --> 11:08.620]  We'll see you next time.
