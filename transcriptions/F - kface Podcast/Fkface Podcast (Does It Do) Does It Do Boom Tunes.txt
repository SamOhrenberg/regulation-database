[00:00.000 --> 00:05.320]  This season of Does It Do is brought to you by our friends at Shady Rays.
[00:07.420 --> 00:09.700]  I had two pairs of glasses on. That was a good move.
[00:09.860 --> 00:14.580]  Boom tunes. Are they tunes? Do they boom? Find out today on Does It Do.
[00:15.500 --> 00:16.420]  I always forget the song.
[00:18.120 --> 00:21.860]  My name is Geoff and with me, as always, is Gavin. We are research assistants
[00:21.860 --> 00:27.680]  at Uniform. Uniform. Combining the power of one with the fabric of the farm. Uniform.
[00:27.680 --> 00:32.000]  And we have been tasked by the company to take a look at some of the products you see on the
[00:32.000 --> 00:37.660]  internet, on the television, on social media, that purport to be, to do something that's
[00:38.100 --> 00:41.260]  fantastical. Too good to be true, even, if you will. We take a look at those and we determine
[00:41.820 --> 00:45.540]  if they actually do those things. And if not, maybe they do something else just as good.
[00:46.720 --> 00:50.060]  That's right. We test using the who, the why, and the how.
[00:51.660 --> 00:52.740]  What is that face for?
[00:52.960 --> 00:53.580]  It's on me.
[00:54.580 --> 00:55.540]  It's on my face.
[00:55.560 --> 00:55.860]  I keep forgetting.
[00:56.140 --> 01:00.020]  Now, here's the deal about Boontunes. Congratulations on your purchase of Boontunes.
[01:00.320 --> 01:04.880]  Now you can turn anything into a speaker, from boxes to cups to cans.
[01:05.180 --> 01:09.100]  So, like, say you're out and about and you don't have, you want to listen to some music,
[01:09.200 --> 01:10.700]  you want to kick up the jams.
[01:10.960 --> 01:11.180]  Yeah.
[01:11.320 --> 01:14.760]  But your phone isn't on.
[01:15.700 --> 01:17.700]  Or it's on, but the speaker's off.
[01:17.840 --> 01:20.900]  Maybe you blew out your speaker jamming too hard.
[01:20.960 --> 01:21.480]  Got it wet.
[01:21.480 --> 01:22.700]  And got it wet.
[01:22.800 --> 01:25.600]  And we can't afford to buy a new phone because they're very expensive.
[01:25.900 --> 01:27.460]  Good luck plugging this into it though.
[01:27.720 --> 01:31.360]  That's an issue. Luckily, though, you also have a computer with you.
[01:32.080 --> 01:33.260]  And it got wet.
[01:33.420 --> 01:36.580]  And the computer got wet. All we have is this box.
[01:37.480 --> 01:40.080]  So here's what we do. We affix the bottom to the thing.
[01:40.160 --> 01:43.180]  And now we're going to, we're going to turn this box into a speaker.
[01:43.240 --> 01:43.580]  All right.
[01:43.920 --> 01:46.820]  So I'm a sucker for a really good...
[01:53.160 --> 01:54.240]  Listen to that.
[01:54.340 --> 01:55.140]  Here's what you can do.
[01:55.240 --> 01:56.000]  Oh, no.
[01:57.640 --> 01:59.060]  And that's as loud as it goes, huh?
[01:59.660 --> 02:00.760]  The singer is singing.
[02:00.920 --> 02:03.220]  Okay. Okay. But how about this? How about this?
[02:09.340 --> 02:10.280]  Let me sort you out.
[02:10.880 --> 02:12.240]  I can't hear anything right now.
[02:15.820 --> 02:17.240]  Now dance responsibly.
[02:19.860 --> 02:21.420]  I'm definitely jamming.
[02:23.300 --> 02:24.900]  You listen to your own podcast, huh?
[02:25.400 --> 02:27.740]  Well, this is just a podcast, but if it was music, I'd be jamming.
[02:28.000 --> 02:28.920]  Here, put this on your head.
[02:29.040 --> 02:29.160]  Yeah.
[02:29.460 --> 02:31.360]  All right. It's like a private concert.
[02:33.480 --> 02:34.660]  He's really getting into it.
[02:40.320 --> 02:41.060]  What'd you think?
[02:41.280 --> 02:44.680]  Well, it's not louder than anything I've ever listened to.
[02:45.060 --> 02:46.100]  What if we boost it?
[02:46.600 --> 02:46.920]  Okay.
[02:47.600 --> 02:48.180]  With this.
[02:48.620 --> 02:49.060]  Five of them.
[02:49.380 --> 02:49.560]  Okay.
[02:51.860 --> 02:52.740]  Oh, that's way louder.
[02:52.920 --> 02:53.680]  Oh, but this is broken.
[02:53.820 --> 02:55.080]  Oh, you didn't hear that.
[02:55.180 --> 02:55.880]  I didn't hear that.
[02:59.300 --> 02:59.940]  All right.
[03:00.180 --> 03:00.880]  All right, put that on.
[03:10.200 --> 03:11.160]  Oh, that is cooking.
[03:13.340 --> 03:13.940]  There you go.
[03:15.540 --> 03:16.760]  You got to get in on this.
[03:16.860 --> 03:17.100]  All right.
[03:17.360 --> 03:19.240]  It's a whole different world with five.
[03:19.700 --> 03:20.500]  Here, put your head in.
[03:21.300 --> 03:22.260]  All right, you have to be that.
[03:22.480 --> 03:22.720]  Okay.
[03:22.860 --> 03:23.800]  You're very excited about it.
[03:23.820 --> 03:24.100]  Okay.
[03:25.780 --> 03:27.020]  There's only one working.
[03:27.260 --> 03:28.640]  Is that, are they all here?
[03:28.920 --> 03:29.840]  They're all there.
[03:30.000 --> 03:30.640]  Are they all on?
[03:30.760 --> 03:31.580]  No, this one's on.
[03:32.900 --> 03:33.880]  They're all on.
[03:34.320 --> 03:35.200]  It's only one on?
[03:36.500 --> 03:38.140]  No, there's one in the back on.
[03:38.680 --> 03:39.540]  That one's on.
[03:39.620 --> 03:40.100]  They're all on.
[03:40.120 --> 03:40.780]  I can feel them.
[03:45.040 --> 03:46.140]  What were you doing?
[03:46.580 --> 03:47.740]  I was just putting them on.
[03:48.140 --> 03:49.380]  It's just all in one ear.
[03:49.380 --> 03:50.640]  How did that not work?
[03:51.020 --> 03:51.620]  It did work.
[03:51.660 --> 03:51.940]  Oh, okay.
[03:52.180 --> 03:52.720]  It worked like crazy.
[03:53.260 --> 03:54.140]  Maybe we need something bigger.
[03:58.900 --> 04:00.460]  I feel like I should be more aggressive.
[04:15.520 --> 04:19.120]  If you are anything like me and talk like this,
[04:19.120 --> 04:22.020]  you love to game and stare at screens all day long
[04:22.020 --> 04:24.960]  until your eyes are bugging out and vibrating
[04:24.960 --> 04:26.860]  and you can't tell what a color is anymore.
[04:27.080 --> 04:29.960]  But they have blue light glasses that will help level up
[04:29.960 --> 04:32.140]  your gaming style and reduce your eye strain.
[04:32.220 --> 04:32.780]  It's important.
[04:32.900 --> 04:33.780]  Don't strain your eyes.
[04:34.180 --> 04:37.200]  Shady Rays is also committed to making a difference
[04:37.200 --> 04:39.160]  in communities across the U.S.

[04:45.860 --> 04:48.100]  through some of their most challenging times.
[04:48.100 --> 04:51.060]  If your Shady Rays go MIA or take a hit,
[04:51.220 --> 04:52.260]  don't sweat it.
[04:52.500 --> 04:54.860]  They've got lost and broken protection,
[04:55.260 --> 04:57.180]  so they'll cover you from day one.

[05:14.780 --> 05:17.320]  by over 250,000 people.
[05:18.120 --> 05:21.720]  Thinking about where would a boom tune come most in handy?
[05:23.740 --> 05:24.220]  Exactly.
[05:24.760 --> 05:26.760]  What do they not let you have in prison, probably?
[05:26.960 --> 05:27.680]  Boomboxes, right?
[05:27.880 --> 05:28.040]  Yeah.
[05:28.100 --> 05:29.760]  But everybody's human right is to poop,
[05:29.960 --> 05:31.320]  so they have to give you a toilet.
[05:31.600 --> 05:32.660]  Where are you getting that music from?
[05:32.740 --> 05:33.940]  You get a small boom tune,
[05:34.460 --> 05:37.900]  you plug it into your incredibly small MP3 player.
[05:38.300 --> 05:38.860]  Like this?
[05:39.520 --> 05:40.360]  Well, yeah.
[05:46.460 --> 05:48.120]  Oh, that's already an improvement.
[05:51.640 --> 05:52.720]  Well, don't flush them.
[05:53.600 --> 05:54.840]  They've gone down the poo hole.
[05:55.540 --> 05:57.440]  So we should have a whole prison concert, right?
[05:57.600 --> 05:57.930]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[05:58.640 --> 05:59.280]  After the lights are out.
[05:59.300 --> 06:00.580]  This is like Coachella.
[06:00.780 --> 06:01.760]  The guards have gone to sleep?
[06:02.020 --> 06:02.480]  At fulsome.
[06:02.640 --> 06:03.280]  Yeah, there you go.
[06:06.280 --> 06:07.680]  And what a compact setup.
[06:08.040 --> 06:10.980]  And then if you hear the guard coming, flush.
[06:13.680 --> 06:14.800]  There goes your evidence.
[06:16.920 --> 06:17.900]  What's it like in there?
[06:20.500 --> 06:24.900]  I mean, it's honestly about the same as it is right here.
[06:25.440 --> 06:26.980]  What if you don't have your prison toilet on you?
[06:27.600 --> 06:29.820]  What's the closest thing to a prison toilet a human has?
[06:29.960 --> 06:30.940]  Closest thing to like a tunnel?
[06:31.720 --> 06:31.920]  Yeah.
[06:33.320 --> 06:33.680]  Anus.
[06:34.420 --> 06:35.020]  Okay, you ready?
[06:35.200 --> 06:35.420]  Yeah.
[06:40.940 --> 06:41.560]  Entirely muted.
[06:41.740 --> 06:43.340]  It sucked all the noise away.
[06:43.480 --> 06:44.040]  Oh, you know what?
[06:44.300 --> 06:45.660]  The stickies on.
[06:45.940 --> 06:47.340]  Now I have to touch it.
[06:47.340 --> 06:49.200]  My kidneys are having a concert right now.
[06:49.200 --> 06:51.980]  I bet it just transferred to somewhere deep inside of me.
[06:52.120 --> 06:53.040]  Is it still in me?
[06:53.240 --> 06:54.940]  No, I'm taking the sticky thing off.
[06:59.180 --> 06:59.580]  Ready?
[06:59.840 --> 07:00.080]  Yeah.
[07:07.010 --> 07:07.810]  Maybe it's...
[07:07.810 --> 07:08.930]  Are you going to put it on the inside?
[07:09.190 --> 07:12.030]  Okay, let's mark this one so I don't have to touch it later.
[07:15.270 --> 07:16.710]  It's so much more quiet.
[07:16.950 --> 07:17.850]  I can't feel it anywhere.
[07:19.250 --> 07:21.530]  Oh, I felt it there.
[07:21.630 --> 07:21.890]  Hold on.
[07:22.750 --> 07:23.550]  That's tickly.
[07:23.990 --> 07:24.270]  All right.
[07:24.270 --> 07:25.750]  Human body's not a good speaker.
[07:25.870 --> 07:26.270]  Not great.
[07:26.610 --> 07:29.810]  Let's say you have an important speech coming up you have to give.
[07:30.510 --> 07:30.690]  Yeah.
[07:30.830 --> 07:33.310]  You're about to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award.
[07:33.890 --> 07:34.550]  It's a big deal.
[07:34.930 --> 07:37.430]  But you're anticipating getting laryngitis.
[07:37.730 --> 07:37.890]  Yeah.
[07:38.030 --> 07:40.030]  What if you pre-record the speech?
[07:40.630 --> 07:41.810]  Then you put the boom to...
[07:41.810 --> 07:42.210]  Yeah, there you go.
[07:44.450 --> 07:49.920]  Oh, I can hear it.
[07:49.940 --> 07:50.440]  Put it on your teeth.
[08:00.130 --> 08:01.090]  Doesn't work at all.
[08:01.650 --> 08:02.670]  You want to drum it?
[08:02.990 --> 08:03.890]  You want to Jurassic Park it?
[08:04.170 --> 08:05.310]  Oh, that's an idea.
[08:05.490 --> 08:06.070]  Let's try that.
[08:08.810 --> 08:09.950]  Well, I can hear it.
[08:10.890 --> 08:12.750]  Maybe water is a better conductor.
[08:12.970 --> 08:14.090]  Maybe put some on the sides.
[08:31.130 --> 08:31.590]  Okay.
[08:33.010 --> 08:34.630]  Well, after exhaustive...
[08:42.740 --> 08:43.480]  Batteries in there.
[08:43.760 --> 08:44.440]  It doesn't.
[08:45.180 --> 08:46.280]  Watch out for the laptop.
[08:52.010 --> 08:52.910]  Boom tunes.
[08:52.910 --> 08:58.670]  Only work in the specific instance that you have five of them at once with a splitter.
[08:59.230 --> 09:00.030]  And you're in prison.
[09:00.130 --> 09:01.110]  And you're in prison.
[09:01.830 --> 09:06.870]  And the toilet is large enough to flush all five in the event of a surprise inspection.
[09:07.250 --> 09:08.850]  Outside of that, I don't think it does.
[09:09.850 --> 09:10.670]  Pile of don't.
[09:13.750 --> 09:17.890]  Tune in next week to find out if another product does or doesn't.
