[00:00.000 --> 00:06.220]  The Crunch Cup. Revolutionary new way to eat cereal... or fad.
[00:07.680 --> 00:09.960]  Find out today on Does It Do.
[00:13.860 --> 00:17.320]  Hello, my name is Geoff Ramsey and with me as always, Gavin Free.
[00:17.660 --> 00:22.500]  Two steadfast employees of Uniform. Uniform combining the power of one with the fabric of the form.
[00:22.780 --> 00:27.660]  Uniform. And we are here to test the products that you see all over the internet, all over the TV.
[00:28.000 --> 00:29.560]  Products that seem too good to be true.
[00:29.560 --> 00:36.260]  Are they? We will find out by testing the what, the why, and the how does it do.
[00:36.420 --> 00:42.280]  If it doesn't do what it says, we go the extra mile and we try to find something else that it may do to redeem the product.
[00:42.400 --> 00:46.960]  If it does, it goes in the wall of do. If it does not, it goes in a pile of dump.
[00:47.560 --> 00:49.780]  Gavin, are you familiar with the Crunch Cup?
[00:50.320 --> 00:52.520]  Now I am. Look at that thing.
[00:53.380 --> 01:00.880]  Supposedly the best way on earth to eat cereal. As you know, now that I discovered lactose free milk, I am a big cereal guy again.
[01:01.000 --> 01:03.600]  Got some Froot Loops here. We are just going to go straight bog standard out the gate.
[01:03.760 --> 01:08.100]  We are going to see, can we make some cereal, eat it as we are supposed to.
[01:10.680 --> 01:11.920]  You want some cereal? Yeah.
[01:12.660 --> 01:14.400]  How do you? You will get there.
[01:26.230 --> 01:28.350]  So milk goes in this one? I think we put milk in here.
[01:28.510 --> 01:29.970]  Shall I give you milk? Yeah, milk me.
[01:31.030 --> 01:32.610]  To the tapered part, so just to right here.
[01:33.370 --> 01:34.270]  Don't over milk me.
[01:34.530 --> 01:36.550]  Now I am at 2%. Oh no, that is too much.
[01:37.590 --> 01:39.190]  Stop, stop, stop. That is too much milk.
[01:50.640 --> 01:54.160]  I really thought this would be the non-messy one, but it is okay. We will clean that up.
[01:54.180 --> 01:55.800]  It is so much more violent than I expected.
[01:56.280 --> 01:59.080]  You got your milk staying fresh and milky.
[01:59.540 --> 02:01.160]  You got your cereal staying dry.
[02:01.580 --> 02:02.880]  Not a spoon to be found.
[02:03.460 --> 02:04.240]  Let's see what happens.
[02:04.240 --> 02:05.080]  Do you want to try it?
[02:05.540 --> 02:05.980]  Cheers.
[02:14.140 --> 02:16.080]  That is just a lot of milk, I don't like milk.
[02:16.160 --> 02:16.840]  Where is the fucking cereal?
[02:17.640 --> 02:18.600]  Give me the cereal.
[02:20.680 --> 02:21.960]  I am just drinking milk.
[02:22.800 --> 02:23.840]  I don't like this.
[02:24.840 --> 02:25.780]  The cereal doesn't come...
[02:25.780 --> 02:28.120]  Oh, I got one.
[02:34.760 --> 02:36.720]  I mean, it kind of does.
[02:37.160 --> 02:38.160]  Here is what I appreciate about it.
[02:39.280 --> 02:41.700]  Keeps them separate and there is no soggy factor.
[02:41.700 --> 02:43.220]  Yeah, there is no soggy factor.
[02:43.720 --> 02:46.960]  You are maintaining the integrity of the crunch all the way to the bottom.
[02:47.140 --> 02:51.060]  But you are going to drink 98% of the milk before you eat 20% of the cereal.
[02:51.100 --> 02:51.460]  That is true.
[02:51.540 --> 02:52.360]  And I think that is an issue.
[02:52.420 --> 02:53.960]  If it was mixed, it would be more like this.
[02:54.880 --> 02:56.820]  And this would be a subpar product.
[02:57.200 --> 02:59.160]  But I think you should try it that way to see how it works.
[03:08.240 --> 03:09.260]  It is overwhelming.
[03:11.020 --> 03:11.960]  Very quickly overwhelming.
[03:12.920 --> 03:13.900]  I wouldn't recommend that.
[03:14.360 --> 03:16.100]  So, doesn't, does.
[03:17.780 --> 03:18.560]  Doesn't, eh.
[03:18.980 --> 03:19.420]  Right.
[03:20.360 --> 03:23.300]  I am not ready to recommend this to anybody just yet.
[03:23.540 --> 03:27.040]  I think we need to look around and see if we can find some alternate uses for this bad boy.
[03:27.180 --> 03:28.860]  Because I wouldn't pay for that.
[03:29.140 --> 03:29.900]  How about this, Gav?
[03:31.560 --> 03:32.000]  Perfect.
[03:32.220 --> 03:32.860]  Got some coffee.
[03:33.200 --> 03:35.040]  So, hot water in the main capsule.
[03:35.040 --> 03:37.700]  What is coffee but hot water and coffee?
[03:37.900 --> 03:38.760]  Wait, you are doing whole bean?
[03:39.560 --> 03:40.400]  That is what they gave me.
[03:42.020 --> 03:43.400]  We will try it with whole bean.
[03:43.760 --> 03:44.800]  And then we will switch to instant.
[03:45.540 --> 03:46.660]  Let's see what this is like.
[03:46.780 --> 03:47.440]  You like coffee, huh?
[03:47.500 --> 03:47.980]  Love it.
[03:48.100 --> 03:48.760]  I love it too.
[03:48.820 --> 03:49.080]  Thanks to you.
[03:49.280 --> 03:50.480]  Did I get you any coffee?
[03:50.580 --> 03:50.720]  Yeah.
[03:50.880 --> 03:52.000]  Try this new invention out.
[03:52.360 --> 03:53.100]  Is it just hot water?
[03:53.280 --> 03:54.280]  It is just hot water and coffee.
[03:54.360 --> 03:55.020]  That is all coffee is.
[03:55.040 --> 03:55.680]  Hot water and coffee.
[03:55.800 --> 03:55.940]  Okay.
[03:57.160 --> 03:57.460]  Cheers.
[03:57.640 --> 03:57.840]  Cheers.
[04:00.300 --> 04:01.100]  Freaking hell, that is hot.
[04:02.580 --> 04:03.560]  Why is it so hot?
[04:03.880 --> 04:05.880]  It has got to be hot to make coffee.
[04:05.880 --> 04:07.680]  Is that...
[04:09.540 --> 04:10.520]  Alright, so that did not work.
[04:11.480 --> 04:12.460]  Let me take that from you.
[04:13.200 --> 04:14.680]  So, that is a no?
[04:15.260 --> 04:16.440]  Burn the shit out of me.
[04:16.800 --> 04:18.880]  Alright, well, that is unacceptable temperature.
[04:19.820 --> 04:20.360]  Oh, that is hot.
[04:20.440 --> 04:21.800]  It was getting hotter at each sip I took.
[04:21.820 --> 04:22.280]  Yeah, that is hot.
[04:22.380 --> 04:23.080]  It is hot in my hands.
[04:24.880 --> 04:25.280]  Oh, yeah.
[04:25.500 --> 04:26.740]  Instant coffee is probably the way to go.
[04:27.460 --> 04:28.240]  Hold on, hold on.
[04:34.780 --> 04:35.480]  You want me to try this one?
[04:35.620 --> 04:35.760]  Yeah.
[04:40.120 --> 04:42.620]  Man, I have got a long day of work ahead of me.
[04:42.800 --> 04:45.220]  If I am so tired, I could use a pick-me-up.
[04:45.960 --> 04:46.820]  If only I had coffee.
[05:01.120 --> 05:01.920]  I am going to be honest.
[05:02.960 --> 05:03.740]  I have had worse.
[05:09.360 --> 05:10.020]  You want to give it a try?
[05:10.260 --> 05:10.500]  Yeah.
[05:10.720 --> 05:11.300]  Yeah, that is not bad.
[05:11.700 --> 05:13.000]  You know what I like with my coffee?
[05:13.140 --> 05:14.260]  You probably want a little bit of milk in yours.
[05:14.380 --> 05:14.780]  A little bit of milk.
[05:14.980 --> 05:15.680]  I am not a milk guy.
[05:16.060 --> 05:17.260]  Do I add the milk to the coffee?
[05:17.600 --> 05:17.800]  Yeah.
[05:17.960 --> 05:18.100]  Yeah.
[05:18.280 --> 05:18.900]  You think you could, right?
[05:20.080 --> 05:20.800]  A little bit of that.
[05:23.660 --> 05:24.840]  A little bit of a...
[05:25.380 --> 05:26.200]  A little bit of a swish.
[05:26.280 --> 05:27.020]  That seems perfect.
[05:27.100 --> 05:29.400]  That is a good-looking cup of coffee right there if you are a milker.
[05:30.860 --> 05:31.440]  Oh, ow.
[05:31.580 --> 05:31.960]  Oh, ow.
[05:32.160 --> 05:32.740]  It is hot still.
[05:32.980 --> 05:33.420]  It is still hot.
[05:33.560 --> 05:34.020]  Okay, here we go.
[05:41.370 --> 05:41.730]  Oh.
[05:42.470 --> 05:45.030]  It has got the wrong type of flavor.
[05:48.670 --> 05:50.030]  They all come in wrong.
[05:50.490 --> 05:51.050]  It is so good.
[05:55.490 --> 05:57.210]  Did you say they come in wrong?
[05:57.210 --> 05:57.970]  Is that what you said?
[05:58.290 --> 06:01.390]  My teeth have gone brown.
[06:02.470 --> 06:03.930]  Maybe we will try something else, Gavin.
[06:04.130 --> 06:08.350]  Let us say you are an artist and you are trying to make...
[06:08.350 --> 06:09.110]  I have a friend.
[06:09.570 --> 06:11.150]  He told me the other day, we were talking about it.
[06:11.170 --> 06:11.750]  He does oil paints.
[06:11.830 --> 06:15.030]  He said the hardest part about painting is mixing consistent colors.
[06:15.350 --> 06:16.210]  What is your favorite color, Gavin?
[06:16.370 --> 06:16.730]  Blue.
[06:17.030 --> 06:17.370]  No.
[06:17.570 --> 06:18.030]  Try that again.
[06:18.210 --> 06:18.570]  Green.
[06:19.610 --> 06:19.970]  GURPL.
[06:20.110 --> 06:20.970]  That is your favorite color?
[06:21.210 --> 06:21.230]  That is the one.
[06:21.370 --> 06:22.390]  Wow, that is my favorite color too.
[06:22.710 --> 06:25.730]  Let us see if we can make our own GURPL right here.
[06:27.510 --> 06:28.050]  Can I?
[06:28.310 --> 06:28.830]  Yes, please.
[06:35.560 --> 06:36.540]  How did that happen?
[06:36.660 --> 06:37.060]  I do not know.
[06:37.420 --> 06:38.460]  It went on my legs.
[06:38.940 --> 06:41.700]  It is on my leg though.
[06:42.400 --> 06:42.720]  Hey, Gavin.
[06:42.900 --> 06:43.940]  I am going to need your finger again.
[06:47.420 --> 06:49.780]  I tried to plug it.
[06:49.880 --> 06:50.960]  I am going to paint my masterpiece.
[06:51.500 --> 06:53.200]  I need to mix my paint.
[06:54.620 --> 06:55.340]  Oh, yes.
[06:55.440 --> 06:55.980]  Look at that.
[06:56.820 --> 06:58.260]  You are not really getting the green.
[07:12.520 --> 07:13.480]  This is the GURPL portrait.
[07:13.980 --> 07:14.520]  Look at it.
[07:16.480 --> 07:17.940]  That is the coolest thing I have ever seen.
[07:18.960 --> 07:20.140]  Do you want to add a little more GURP to it?
[07:20.200 --> 07:20.320]  Yes.
[07:25.040 --> 07:25.600]  That is good.
[07:25.720 --> 07:26.440]  It is really good.
[07:26.640 --> 07:27.100]  It is really good.
[07:28.080 --> 07:28.880]  Last great idea.
[07:30.420 --> 07:31.560]  There is milk everywhere.
[07:31.840 --> 07:33.680]  You know about Coke and Mentos, right?
[07:33.840 --> 07:34.080]  Yes.
[07:34.640 --> 07:35.440]  Where is the Diet Coke?
[07:39.590 --> 07:40.490]  It does not work with that.
[07:40.770 --> 07:41.190]  Yes, sure.
[07:41.470 --> 07:42.410]  It only works with Diet Coke?
[07:42.810 --> 07:43.430]  Is that true?
[07:43.430 --> 07:43.670]  Yes.
[07:52.580 --> 07:53.560]  Did any of those go in?
[07:53.600 --> 07:53.740]  No.
[07:56.360 --> 07:57.360]  This is harder than it looks.
[07:58.780 --> 08:02.920]  Just a little bit of green paint and milk in there to seal the deal.
[08:03.700 --> 08:06.180]  Let us say you want to try the Mentos and Coke challenge.
[08:06.300 --> 08:06.460]  Yes.
[08:07.280 --> 08:08.260]  Mentos and regular Coke.
[08:08.420 --> 08:09.680]  Not as popular as Mentos and Diet Coke.
[08:10.280 --> 08:13.680]  But you want to have the moment of magic in your mouth.
[08:13.840 --> 08:17.160]  But you do not want to walk around with a bunch of Mentos in your mouth ready to pop out any time you need it.
[08:17.560 --> 08:21.040]  Why don't you pop that sucker on and take a first spin.
[08:21.260 --> 08:21.660]  There you go.
[08:22.220 --> 08:23.120]  We will see if your head explodes.
[08:23.280 --> 08:23.860]  A little bit of paint there.
[08:24.260 --> 08:24.780]  A little bit of paint.
[08:41.280 --> 08:44.560]  I think it is safe to say this does not do what it does.
[08:44.920 --> 08:47.940]  It kind of does one other thing, but not particularly well.
[08:48.540 --> 08:50.520]  I think we have a product for the pile.
[08:50.580 --> 08:51.160]  What do you say, Gav?
[08:51.640 --> 08:52.560]  Yes, chuck it down there.
[09:08.100 --> 09:08.420]  Well...
[09:10.240 --> 09:11.460]  There you have it.
[09:12.760 --> 09:14.840]  Unfortunately, they cannot all be winners.
[09:15.500 --> 09:18.480]  Crunch Cup, you made it in the pile of don'ts.
[09:18.840 --> 09:19.680]  Retool your product.
[09:19.860 --> 09:20.680]  Come back to us.
[09:21.320 --> 09:21.920]  Make it better.
[09:22.160 --> 09:25.760]  And maybe someday it can be in the wall of dew.
[09:27.960 --> 09:29.500]  Right now it is...
[09:32.840 --> 09:33.780]  See you next week.
[09:35.720 --> 09:37.600]  I have ruined these shoes.
