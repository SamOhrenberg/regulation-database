[00:00.830 --> 00:02.090]  The fuck?
[00:03.090 --> 00:04.490]  Are we rolling on that?
[00:04.870 --> 00:06.110]  Can we do outtakes this season?
[00:09.830 --> 00:13.390]  Season 2 of Does It Do is sponsored by our friends at Shady Rays.
[00:13.490 --> 00:14.410]  Protect your eyes!
[00:14.770 --> 00:15.210]  Seriously.
[00:15.970 --> 00:16.750]  Magic ear.
[00:17.330 --> 00:18.610]  Super hearing device.
[00:18.950 --> 00:19.830]  Or fraud.
[00:20.590 --> 00:22.170]  Find out today on Does It Do.
[00:22.590 --> 00:24.190]  Do-do-do-do-do-do.
[00:24.210 --> 00:24.790]  Does it do?
[00:24.910 --> 00:25.670]  Do-do-do-do-do-do.
[00:25.770 --> 00:27.050]  If it did, it would do that.
[00:27.110 --> 00:27.930]  We would do it.
[00:28.030 --> 00:28.310]  Do that.
[00:28.350 --> 00:29.810]  That's a good... you're doing a little peanuts dance.
[00:29.810 --> 00:30.570]  Is that what that is?
[00:30.710 --> 00:33.210]  We are employees of Unifarm.
[00:33.490 --> 00:33.850]  Unifarm.
[00:33.970 --> 00:36.230]  Combining the power of one with the fabric of the farm.
[00:37.030 --> 00:37.390]  Unifarm.
[00:37.530 --> 00:41.950]  We are charged with taking a look at products that you might find on the internet or on
[00:41.950 --> 00:42.490]  social media.
[00:42.690 --> 00:43.670]  Seems too good to be true.
[00:43.950 --> 00:44.870]  It probably is.
[00:45.050 --> 00:45.830]  That's what we do.
[00:45.850 --> 00:46.790]  We get to the bottom of it.
[00:46.850 --> 00:48.230]  We find out, does it do?
[00:48.670 --> 00:49.750]  What it says it does.
[00:49.810 --> 00:50.830]  And how do we do that, Gavin?
[00:52.790 --> 00:53.870]  Those three things.
[00:54.110 --> 00:54.490]  Right there.
[00:56.250 --> 00:58.170]  So they say the magic ear...
[00:58.170 --> 00:59.510]  You didn't list the things.
[00:59.510 --> 01:00.890]  Well, they're listed in...
[01:00.890 --> 01:00.990]  Oh.
[01:01.150 --> 01:02.530]  I did like this, because they're going to be on the thing.
[01:02.930 --> 01:04.550]  It's a picture of Al Gore on the front, it looks like.
[01:04.910 --> 01:08.150]  And it says, uh, you won't believe what you can hear.
[01:08.450 --> 01:12.970]  Enhances sounds, 15 different volume levels, portable and discreet.
[01:13.030 --> 01:13.870]  It's great for watching TV.
[01:14.350 --> 01:17.190]  So instead of turning the TV up, just turn up your magic ear.
[01:17.370 --> 01:19.870]  So let's see how... well, this is...
[01:19.870 --> 01:20.770]  Yeah, pretty discreet, right?
[01:20.850 --> 01:23.190]  Just stick that right there.
[01:23.270 --> 01:23.450]  Yeah.
[01:24.010 --> 01:26.670]  And people are going to think you've got your personal radio on.
[01:26.770 --> 01:28.850]  The infomercial said you can hear a pin drop.
[01:28.850 --> 01:29.610]  We have a pin.
[01:29.810 --> 01:30.310]  Across the room.
[01:30.770 --> 01:31.710]  We need to do a control.
[01:32.050 --> 01:34.650]  I'm not going to look, though, because then I'll trick myself into thinking I hear it.
[01:34.690 --> 01:35.370]  I'm going to close my eyes.
[01:36.990 --> 01:37.470]  Oh, I heard that.
[01:37.950 --> 01:38.750]  I definitely heard that.
[01:38.770 --> 01:39.210]  Did you hear that?
[01:39.290 --> 01:39.630]  I heard it.
[01:39.650 --> 01:40.670]  Let me see if I hear it over here, though.
[01:40.670 --> 01:40.830]  Okay.
[01:41.170 --> 01:42.170]  This is real science.
[01:42.950 --> 01:43.610]  Now, do you hear this?
[01:44.810 --> 01:45.090]  Yeah.
[01:45.370 --> 01:45.550]  Okay.
[01:47.850 --> 01:48.850]  I heard it very well.
[01:49.910 --> 01:51.730]  I heard it as well over here as I did back there.
[01:51.850 --> 01:53.610]  Well, the control test is working really well.
[01:53.610 --> 01:59.210]  Alright, so now I'll just discreetly put these... nobody's going to know that I have these on.
[01:59.290 --> 01:59.450]  Right.
[01:59.710 --> 02:00.290]  Can you hear now?
[02:00.690 --> 02:00.950]  Yeah.
[02:01.490 --> 02:01.890]  Do it again.
[02:05.850 --> 02:06.130]  Alright.
[02:07.290 --> 02:08.290]  I didn't hear that at all.
[02:09.810 --> 02:12.850]  I can hear stuff a lot louder, but I didn't hear that at all.
[02:12.990 --> 02:13.390]  Try again.
[02:16.110 --> 02:16.470]  No.
[02:17.310 --> 02:18.170]  Let me turn it up.
[02:18.330 --> 02:19.030]  Let's do it at five.
[02:19.310 --> 02:20.470]  I feel like I'm talking louder.
[02:20.950 --> 02:21.330]  You are.
[02:22.030 --> 02:23.070]  Can you hear me if I whisper?
[02:23.750 --> 02:24.110]  What?
[02:25.770 --> 02:27.550]  I didn't, but I think I know what you said.
[02:29.750 --> 02:30.590]  I heard that.
[02:30.810 --> 02:31.090]  Okay.
[02:31.410 --> 02:32.410]  Alright, so that's at five.
[02:32.630 --> 02:35.170]  I would say at six, it's about normal ears.
[02:35.290 --> 02:35.950]  What about 15?
[02:36.110 --> 02:37.790]  So let's go to 10.
[02:38.010 --> 02:38.210]  Yeah.
[02:38.710 --> 02:39.610]  And let me try again.
[02:42.800 --> 02:44.020]  If anything, it's gotten worse.
[02:44.980 --> 02:46.460]  Let's go all the way to 15.
[02:58.300 --> 03:00.220]  Is it like banging a stethoscope?
[03:00.220 --> 03:02.680]  Let's flip it and let you see what...
[03:02.680 --> 03:04.720]  I'll hold off on my pronouncements.
[03:08.800 --> 03:09.960]  Oh boy, that's loud.
[03:10.120 --> 03:10.680]  I'm loud.
[03:10.860 --> 03:11.340]  What are you at?
[03:11.860 --> 03:12.260]  Four.
[03:14.780 --> 03:15.340]  Heard it.
[03:16.160 --> 03:17.800]  Did it sound normal?
[03:18.020 --> 03:20.060]  It sounds like maybe there's a cab driving nearby.
[03:21.400 --> 03:22.880]  You're picking up stuff that's too far out.
[03:23.180 --> 03:23.720]  You're like Daredevil.
[03:23.840 --> 03:25.020]  You gotta learn how to shut off the...
[03:25.020 --> 03:25.240]  Yeah.
[03:25.560 --> 03:26.340]  Go to 15.
[03:30.160 --> 03:31.200]  I heard that.
[03:31.200 --> 03:31.720]  Yeah.
[03:31.900 --> 03:32.880]  I'm gonna see what else I can hear.
[03:34.720 --> 03:35.840]  I can hear crunching.
[03:37.340 --> 03:38.940]  I can hear Doritos being eaten.
[03:39.300 --> 03:41.040]  You can hear Gracie eating those Doritos?
[03:41.760 --> 03:42.200]  Can you hear this?
[03:44.200 --> 03:44.980]  Nobody likes me?
[03:45.420 --> 03:45.840]  You did!
[03:47.060 --> 03:50.720]  Now, I may have been cheating because that's your go-to phrase every time you see me.
[03:50.760 --> 03:52.320]  Let me do it like this.
[03:56.660 --> 03:57.520]  I didn't hear that.
[03:57.860 --> 03:58.220]  Oh, good.

[05:15.000 --> 05:15.680]  Did you hear that?
[05:15.780 --> 05:17.720]  No, I'm wearing it.
[05:17.740 --> 05:18.060]  Put it on.
[05:18.060 --> 05:18.100]  Yeah.
[05:20.540 --> 05:22.680]  Put it upside down just in there.
[05:27.540 --> 05:28.800]  You've got to get in on this.
[05:29.300 --> 05:30.120]  That's phenomenal.
[05:32.420 --> 05:34.180]  Is this what ASMR is?
[05:34.240 --> 05:35.160]  It's like the ocean.
[05:36.120 --> 05:37.800]  I feel like I'm in a seashell.
[05:48.990 --> 05:50.270]  That was my bad.
[05:50.390 --> 05:52.510]  Has anyone got a fart ready to go? Preloaded?
[05:53.310 --> 05:53.750]  No.
[05:54.250 --> 05:56.110]  I'll load one of my farts.
[05:56.570 --> 05:57.590]  What do you mean? Oh, you're going to...
[05:57.590 --> 05:59.150]  Because, you know, I record my farts.
[05:59.530 --> 05:59.750]  Yeah.
[06:02.130 --> 06:03.050]  That was me peeing.
[06:04.210 --> 06:04.650]  Why?
[06:04.890 --> 06:05.490]  I don't remember.
[06:07.450 --> 06:08.490]  What is going on?
[06:08.490 --> 06:09.670]  What are these fart wastes?
[06:10.990 --> 06:12.190]  There was one. Hold on.
[06:19.660 --> 06:21.240]  Why would you do that?
[06:23.140 --> 06:25.220]  Oh, my freaking ears.
[06:26.920 --> 06:28.120]  That was 15.
[06:28.880 --> 06:32.280]  That was 15 yelling in my ear from one foot away.
[06:32.420 --> 06:33.500]  You're a lunatic.
[06:33.900 --> 06:35.680]  I just saw and heard my own head.
[06:36.980 --> 06:37.740]  Oh, shit.
[06:37.880 --> 06:40.340]  Oh, my God.
[06:43.440 --> 06:44.280]  More pee.
[06:45.400 --> 06:47.520]  Stop recording yourself pissing.
[06:47.540 --> 06:48.180]  Another one.
[06:49.840 --> 06:50.640]  More piss.
[06:52.620 --> 06:54.020]  Are we learning something here?
[06:54.460 --> 06:55.560]  Is he the new piss boy?
[06:56.620 --> 06:58.660]  Oh, 2020, this is a COVID fart.
[07:08.460 --> 07:10.080]  That is the sound of home cooking.
[07:10.440 --> 07:11.740]  Yeah, let me see if I can hear myself drink.
[07:17.010 --> 07:18.290]  That's the craziest...
[07:25.590 --> 07:27.290]  Craziest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.
[07:27.450 --> 07:29.170]  This is just a microphone and headphones.
[07:29.170 --> 07:30.130]  You've got to hear yourself.
[07:30.310 --> 07:31.650]  Do you have anything to drink?
[07:32.190 --> 07:32.650]  No, do you?
[07:32.770 --> 07:33.350]  Hear me drink.
[07:33.530 --> 07:33.730]  Okay.
[07:40.300 --> 07:40.660]  Dude.
[07:41.100 --> 07:41.760]  Put it back in.
[07:45.570 --> 07:50.710]  If you want to listen to your friends burp or drink soda, I recommend it.
[07:51.190 --> 07:54.490]  If you want to use it for any practical purpose whatsoever, I can't.
[07:54.850 --> 07:55.550]  Not great for pins.
[07:55.730 --> 07:56.390]  Not great for pins.
[07:56.730 --> 07:57.270]  What do you think, Gavin?
[07:57.330 --> 07:59.850]  Does it make it in the hall of do or the pile of don'ts?
[08:04.790 --> 08:05.950]  We'll see you next week.
