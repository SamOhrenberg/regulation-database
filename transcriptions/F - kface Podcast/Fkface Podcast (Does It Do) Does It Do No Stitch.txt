[00:00.000 --> 00:05.140]  Hello and welcome to Does It Do, the program where we test the efficacy of the products
[00:05.140 --> 00:10.720]  that you see advertised on social media, the internet, and television to determine what
[00:10.720 --> 00:17.000]  we here call the WWH. The what, the why, and the how does it do?
[00:17.280 --> 00:20.540]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, and with me, as always, Gavin Free.
[00:20.740 --> 00:21.240]  Welcome, Gavin.
[00:21.600 --> 00:25.280]  Hello. You're nailing it so far. Okay, that's good.
[00:25.280 --> 00:32.540]  Now, we are employees in the R&D, Research and Development, department at Unifarm.
[00:32.840 --> 00:35.600]  Unifarm, combining the power of one with the fabric of the farm.
[00:35.720 --> 00:41.700]  Part of our job is to evaluate the products that are introduced into the market by our peers.
[00:41.880 --> 00:48.420]  As you know, Gavin and I, we invent a lot of products to make the little things a little bit easier in your life,
[00:48.460 --> 00:50.500]  as well as making some of the big things easier, too.
[00:50.780 --> 00:54.820]  And part of doing that is to look at what some of our peers and competitors are doing
[00:54.820 --> 00:57.260]  and determine what they get right and what they get wrong.
[00:57.620 --> 00:59.220]  I hate sewing, Geoff!
[01:01.100 --> 01:06.140]  All right. Don't we all? I agree. And by the way, Gavin, love the enthusiasm.
[01:08.820 --> 01:11.520]  I have a feeling, I have a feeling you felt that.
[01:11.660 --> 01:15.160]  Not one of those fold-outs, huh? Real table.
[01:15.520 --> 01:18.020]  Yeah, well, you know, we don't screw around here on Does It Do?
[01:18.460 --> 01:22.700]  This is the Bell & Howell No-Stitch Handheld Heat Iron.
[01:22.700 --> 01:28.700]  And I'm glad that we have this product here with us today because, as you mentioned earlier, Gavin, you hate...
[01:29.680 --> 01:30.060]  Sewing.
[01:30.200 --> 01:35.020]  There you go. Hopefully, with the No-Stitch, sewing will be a thing of the past.
[01:35.480 --> 01:38.680]  This thing purports to adjust hems, repair seams, and fix tears.
[01:39.100 --> 01:43.160]  Works on any fabric, Gavin, from heavy denim to delicate silk.
[01:43.400 --> 01:50.880]  We're talking denim, cotton, linen, rayon, nylon, corduroy, wool, polyester, acrylic, and silk.
[01:50.880 --> 01:53.840]  Those are all the different kinds of fabric on Earth, I believe.
[01:54.220 --> 01:56.100]  And this thing says it can handle all of them.
[01:56.260 --> 01:59.280]  We're going to find out, does it do that or not?
[01:59.380 --> 02:00.160]  We'll make it do.
[02:00.300 --> 02:01.100]  We'll make it do something.
[02:01.360 --> 02:03.720]  And if it doesn't, it goes on the pile of don'ts.
[02:04.460 --> 02:05.980]  All right, Gavin, let's crack this puppy open.
[02:07.140 --> 02:08.160]  That's secretly formulated.
[02:08.880 --> 02:10.320]  Once that's gone, don't breathe that.
[02:10.700 --> 02:13.080]  Once that's gone, the tool is useless.
[02:13.700 --> 02:18.680]  So, the first thing it says it does, and I think the biggest thing, is it fixes tears, right?
[02:18.680 --> 02:20.840]  So, let's see if it fixes a tear.
[02:20.920 --> 02:21.720]  We've already got one.
[02:30.070 --> 02:31.350]  Okay, you know what?
[02:32.350 --> 02:32.970]  Here's a great...
[02:32.970 --> 02:34.030]  Does it do ought.
[02:36.270 --> 02:37.070]  Do we...
[02:39.090 --> 02:39.490]  Here's...
[02:41.150 --> 02:42.390]  Here's a great idea, Gavin.
[02:42.870 --> 02:43.810]  I can already see it.
[02:43.950 --> 02:44.770]  You're losing it.
[02:45.030 --> 02:48.030]  This isn't a tear, per se, but it could be seen as a hem.
[02:48.370 --> 02:52.330]  Let's see if we can hem Gavin's does it do logo to say...
[02:54.030 --> 02:54.630]  Does do.
[02:56.070 --> 02:58.130]  Now, you hold this right here.
[02:58.270 --> 02:58.450]  Yeah.
[02:58.490 --> 02:59.130]  Put a little bit there.
[02:59.730 --> 03:00.210]  Put a little bit there.
[03:00.410 --> 03:03.690]  And then we'll see if we can change does it do to does do.
[03:03.890 --> 03:08.470]  Now, I'm going to grab the preheated no stitch.
[03:10.190 --> 03:16.870]  And now, according to this, all we have to do is press hard and hold.
[03:17.790 --> 03:18.370]  You feeling the heat?
[03:19.090 --> 03:19.390]  No.
[03:20.370 --> 03:20.970]  I do.
[03:21.870 --> 03:22.190]  Oh, yeah.
[03:22.710 --> 03:23.030]  All right.
[03:23.030 --> 03:23.250]  Oh.
[03:24.030 --> 03:24.790]  Is it doing?
[03:25.430 --> 03:26.450]  It's doing something.
[03:27.010 --> 03:28.510]  It might need some double action.
[03:29.270 --> 03:31.030]  Yeah, it definitely seems like it's...
[03:31.570 --> 03:32.670]  I mean, it definitely says...
[03:32.670 --> 03:33.630]  It used to say does do.
[03:33.950 --> 03:34.910]  That's pretty hem.
[03:36.010 --> 03:36.270]  Oh.
[03:38.410 --> 03:40.030]  It doesn't take a lot to unhem.
[03:41.090 --> 03:43.390]  I'm going to say that's an inconclusive hem.
[03:44.310 --> 03:45.210]  How about this?
[03:45.390 --> 03:46.210]  Let's try it with this.
[03:46.410 --> 03:47.310]  Let's say you have...
[03:47.310 --> 03:50.970]  Gavin, let's say you have two...
[03:50.970 --> 03:52.090]  What are these?
[03:52.090 --> 03:52.750]  T-towels?
[03:52.970 --> 03:55.510]  T-towels, but what if you wanted a picnic blanket?
[03:55.790 --> 03:56.550]  Right, a picnic blanket.
[03:56.610 --> 03:57.190]  That's a great idea.
[03:57.370 --> 03:59.090]  Let's see if we can hem together...
[03:59.950 --> 04:00.690]  What did you call it?
[04:00.690 --> 04:01.510]  A picnic towel?
[04:02.390 --> 04:02.790]  No.
[04:03.950 --> 04:04.870]  A picnic blanket?
[04:05.110 --> 04:05.230]  Yeah.
[04:05.450 --> 04:05.750]  Okay.
[04:05.830 --> 04:07.730]  What do you put down on a nice picnic?
[04:08.150 --> 04:10.230]  Well, I like to hem two t-towels together.
[04:10.410 --> 04:10.570]  Yeah.
[04:14.850 --> 04:15.190]  Ooh.
[04:16.110 --> 04:16.510]  What?
[04:17.130 --> 04:17.910]  Here, hold that.
[04:17.990 --> 04:18.570]  What was that?
[04:21.290 --> 04:22.430]  Someone almost died.
[04:23.170 --> 04:23.470]  Here we go.
[04:23.490 --> 04:23.810]  Quick guide.
[04:23.810 --> 04:24.850]  I just want to make sure we're doing it properly.
[04:27.070 --> 04:28.550]  Squeeze bottle onto dispense glue.
[04:28.830 --> 04:29.510]  Powder evenly.
[04:29.690 --> 04:30.150]  We did that.
[04:30.670 --> 04:31.190]  Fold material.
[04:31.370 --> 04:32.010]  Yeah, we did that.
[04:32.570 --> 04:33.570]  Brush off excess material.
[04:33.810 --> 04:33.950]  Eh.
[04:34.770 --> 04:35.650]  What are we afraid of?
[04:35.670 --> 04:36.350]  Getting extra glued?
[04:37.130 --> 04:38.810]  Press the plate over the air for 30 seconds.
[04:38.930 --> 04:40.150]  Move to the next section for 30 seconds.
[04:40.190 --> 04:41.010]  We just need to make sure.
[04:41.390 --> 04:43.130]  Oh, and then we need to wait four minutes.
[04:43.750 --> 04:44.030]  Oh.
[04:44.650 --> 04:46.410]  So just give it a good 30 seconds.
[04:47.650 --> 04:48.650]  In all the spots.
[04:53.680 --> 04:54.480]  Why are you touching me?
[04:54.580 --> 04:54.700]  What?
[04:55.660 --> 04:57.480]  We might be able to tug of war these apart.
[04:58.060 --> 04:59.000]  I think we probably...
[04:59.000 --> 05:00.500]  Well, I mean, let's...
[05:00.500 --> 05:03.620]  To be fair to Bell and Howell, we're pretty strong.
[05:03.880 --> 05:06.760]  I think we might be stronger than the average towel tugger.
[05:07.360 --> 05:08.100]  Let's see, Gavin.
[05:08.240 --> 05:09.120]  Did it... did it...
[05:09.120 --> 05:10.600]  Oh, no!
[05:17.360 --> 05:18.060]  Don't breathe that.
[05:18.100 --> 05:18.540]  That's glue.
[05:18.660 --> 05:19.340]  Don't breathe the glue in.
[05:21.620 --> 05:22.380]  Look at that.
[05:22.420 --> 05:23.060]  I gotta say.
[05:23.260 --> 05:24.040]  I gotta say.
[05:24.040 --> 05:26.040]  It definitely...
[05:39.230 --> 05:39.590]  Yeah.
[05:40.550 --> 05:42.210]  This feels like a picnic.
[05:42.510 --> 05:42.610]  Yeah.
[05:43.890 --> 05:46.290]  Well, I don't think it did the first one, but I think it did this one.
[05:47.390 --> 05:49.250]  Let's see if it does the next thing it purports to.
[05:49.450 --> 05:54.350]  What if we had an argument and we wanted to split into two separate picnics?
[05:57.530 --> 05:58.870]  Let's do that behind the table, though.
[05:58.890 --> 05:59.190]  Yeah.
[05:59.470 --> 06:01.410]  I disagree with the way you run a picnic.
[06:02.770 --> 06:03.770]  Where's the hummus?
[06:03.770 --> 06:04.810]  I'm going.
[06:04.970 --> 06:05.570]  I'm taking my...
[06:05.570 --> 06:06.410]  I'm taking my tea towel.
[06:06.550 --> 06:07.210]  I'm going over there.
[06:07.290 --> 06:07.830]  See ya.
[06:09.970 --> 06:10.410]  Jesus.
[06:13.610 --> 06:14.770]  It's really stuck it.
[06:14.850 --> 06:15.310]  All right.
[06:15.650 --> 06:15.890]  What?
[06:22.410 --> 06:24.770]  I was about to say, this is all my weight.
[06:24.910 --> 06:25.910]  And then that was enough.
[06:27.230 --> 06:34.790]  With less than five minutes of affixing, it almost held the entire weight of a British man.
[06:35.950 --> 06:39.010]  Which is less than the weight of an American man, but still.
[06:39.370 --> 06:40.490]  I've got some melt dust in my beard.
[06:40.690 --> 06:43.990]  I have to admit, that felt pretty good.
[06:44.390 --> 06:48.410]  One other thing it says that it does is that it fixes tears.
[06:49.490 --> 06:49.910]  Ooh.
[06:52.650 --> 06:53.490]  Oh no!
[06:54.430 --> 06:56.270]  So you've got a hole in your shirt now.
[06:56.890 --> 06:58.450]  Let's see if we can repair that.
[06:59.110 --> 06:59.530]  Excellent.
[06:59.650 --> 07:00.310]  That's exactly what we need.
[07:02.030 --> 07:03.170]  I've got a gut flap.
[07:03.210 --> 07:04.420]  I don't want you to get in trouble.
[07:04.420 --> 07:06.260]  I don't want to hurt you.
[07:06.760 --> 07:07.920]  So I've got an ironing board.
[07:12.730 --> 07:13.470]  Yeah, there we go.
[07:15.110 --> 07:17.510]  So now we just need to...
[07:18.450 --> 07:19.430]  You're doing great.
[07:19.530 --> 07:20.150]  You stay still.
[07:22.270 --> 07:22.930]  You know what?
[07:23.330 --> 07:24.310]  Gravity's going to fuck us here.
[07:24.690 --> 07:25.270]  Hold on a second.
[07:26.430 --> 07:27.370]  Do me a favor, Gav.
[07:28.390 --> 07:29.270]  Yeah, there you go.
[07:29.670 --> 07:30.370]  Appreciate that.
[07:30.570 --> 07:31.810]  That's exactly what I was thinking.
[07:34.730 --> 07:35.250]  All right.
[07:39.210 --> 07:40.210]  Don't breathe this part.
[07:40.350 --> 07:40.850]  You don't want that.
[07:42.390 --> 07:43.170]  It's going to cause a...
[07:43.790 --> 07:45.130]  Do you know what mesothelioma is?
[07:45.170 --> 07:45.790]  Is that your penis?
[07:46.090 --> 07:46.250]  Oh.
[07:48.750 --> 07:50.130]  Did you just ask if my penis was mesothelioma?
[07:50.870 --> 07:51.070]  No.
[07:51.210 --> 07:52.310]  Here, hold this with your right hand.
[07:52.350 --> 07:52.750]  You're right-handed.
[07:56.510 --> 07:57.410]  You just hold it still.
[07:57.990 --> 07:59.010]  I'll deal with the other stuff.
[08:04.740 --> 08:05.020]  Ow!
[08:06.640 --> 08:07.920]  I don't know where a good place to put my hand is.
[08:09.560 --> 08:09.840]  So...
[08:10.160 --> 08:11.020]  How have things been going at home?
[08:11.600 --> 08:14.060]  I was cleaning some cat piss off a carpet.
[08:14.260 --> 08:15.100]  You deal with a lot of cat pee?
[08:16.320 --> 08:17.740]  Yeah, pretty much anywhere that...
[08:18.120 --> 08:19.900]  Maybe that's a direction we could get into at Uniform.
[08:20.220 --> 08:20.620]  Uniform.
[08:21.020 --> 08:23.080]  Combining the power of one with the fabric of the form.
[08:23.360 --> 08:23.720]  Uniform.
[08:24.400 --> 08:25.300]  Cat pee removal.
[08:26.220 --> 08:27.460]  It's really difficult to get up.
[08:27.660 --> 08:28.900]  Yeah, well, it's stinky too, right?
[08:29.480 --> 08:30.000]  I might do it.
[08:30.400 --> 08:30.640]  Oh, yeah.
[08:30.700 --> 08:31.520]  No, you're doing great.
[08:32.300 --> 08:33.260]  This is going to work.
[08:34.780 --> 08:35.180]  Ow!
[08:37.220 --> 08:37.620]  Oh.
[08:38.400 --> 08:39.340]  Yeah, that was...
[08:39.340 --> 08:39.720]  Sorry.
[08:40.280 --> 08:41.840]  I was enthusiastic like you were earlier.
[08:41.920 --> 08:42.960]  Yeah, it better work, right?
[08:46.900 --> 08:48.140]  That was such a shock.
[08:48.280 --> 08:49.200]  I'm sweating now.
[08:50.340 --> 08:56.740]  We are providing a public service to every patron of the internet, television, and social media.
[08:56.860 --> 09:00.180]  Anybody who's ever thought about buying a product that seemed too good to be true?
[09:00.420 --> 09:01.560]  Well, now we'll find out.
[09:01.600 --> 09:03.860]  Was it too good to be true or does it do?
[09:04.620 --> 09:05.980]  Am I not in the right spot?
[09:06.020 --> 09:06.580]  Not even close.
[09:07.040 --> 09:07.840]  No, you're not even...
[09:07.840 --> 09:09.760]  You're just burning your shirt at this point.
[09:10.140 --> 09:17.520]  We're supposed to be determining the efficacy of products to see if we could glean insights from them.
[09:17.880 --> 09:24.520]  My first insight right now is I feel like there is a need for a portable chest-held ironing board.
[09:24.800 --> 09:28.740]  Like, I'm sensing that this part right here, we cut this off right here.
[09:29.100 --> 09:30.840]  We cut this off right here.
[09:31.200 --> 09:32.660]  Just like right there.
[09:33.480 --> 09:34.540]  Maybe form it a little?
[09:34.760 --> 09:36.560]  Maybe separate it and have a lap one?
[09:36.560 --> 09:39.200]  We could have a lap one. We could have a lap one if you want to do lap ironing.
[09:39.380 --> 09:40.120]  Here, I'm going to take this from you.
[09:40.540 --> 09:41.500]  Let's see if it did.
[09:41.660 --> 09:41.780]  Yeah.
[09:44.780 --> 09:45.100]  Ah!
[09:46.600 --> 09:47.800]  Have you made it two holes?
[09:51.490 --> 09:52.410]  Boy, that's hot!
[09:53.550 --> 09:54.190]  Jesus Christ!
[09:55.530 --> 09:56.170]  That's perfect!
[09:57.130 --> 09:58.390]  It's like it was never there.
[09:58.730 --> 10:00.190]  You can't even see...
[10:00.190 --> 10:02.070]  We had some sloppy work here and there.
[10:02.070 --> 10:08.010]  But you look right here, you can't even tell that this was cut and then re-affixed.
[10:09.790 --> 10:15.330]  I gotta go, I gotta say, so far, I think this thing does what it says it does.
[10:15.530 --> 10:16.190]  It do's.
[10:17.830 --> 10:21.730]  But let's not, let's not be, let's not, you know, let's not rest on our laurels.
[10:21.790 --> 10:25.090]  Just because it does what it does, doesn't mean that it doesn't also do other things.
[10:25.690 --> 10:26.730]  We have here a...
[10:26.730 --> 10:27.370]  Fry an egg!
[10:28.330 --> 10:29.410]  Yeah, but we don't have any eggs.
[10:29.410 --> 10:31.210]  But what we do have is some old baseball cards.
[10:31.670 --> 10:32.470]  These are called Rad Dudes.
[10:32.570 --> 10:33.410]  I remember if you...
[10:34.070 --> 10:35.650]  These were real popular, you liked these.
[10:36.050 --> 10:37.110]  Alright, here's Hurt and Harry.
[10:37.350 --> 10:39.190]  He's a workouter and totally buff Tina.
[10:39.570 --> 10:42.810]  Since they both like to work out, what if we glued them together?
[10:44.070 --> 10:45.750]  Like, does it work on more than just fabric?
[10:45.810 --> 10:46.570]  That's what I want to know.
[10:47.270 --> 10:48.770]  Won't you, yeah, won't you...
[10:48.770 --> 10:49.610]  30 seconds.
[10:50.330 --> 10:50.870]  You gotta press hard.
[10:54.070 --> 10:54.950]  I'll turn mine off.
[10:57.430 --> 10:58.250]  I'll turn it back on.
[10:59.410 --> 10:59.610]  Okay.
[11:02.450 --> 11:03.310]  Oh my lord.
[11:04.090 --> 11:06.750]  Not only are they stuck together, it didn't damage the card at all.
[11:06.810 --> 11:07.930]  We made a super card!
[11:11.150 --> 11:15.130]  Now, I'm not saying that you should be an unsavory, unscrupulous individual.
[11:15.950 --> 11:17.970]  But let's say you got a hold of some baseball cards.
[11:19.010 --> 11:21.210]  You open them up, you got the card you wanted out of it.
[11:21.250 --> 11:25.490]  Maybe you just want to put that pack back together and sell it to some unsuspecting person...
[11:25.490 --> 11:27.850]  ...who doesn't realize...
[11:28.690 --> 11:30.290]  ...you already got the Chase card.
[11:30.650 --> 11:36.030]  You got the Hurtin' Harry Totally Buff Tina 1 of 1 combo card.
[11:36.490 --> 11:37.870]  So now we'll just close this back up.
[11:37.890 --> 11:41.830]  And by the way, if this works with Rad Dude's cards, if this works with Junk Wax...
[11:41.830 --> 11:42.910]  ...this is going to work with mail.
[11:43.210 --> 11:44.390]  This is going to work with your neighbor's mail.
[11:44.710 --> 11:46.050]  You want to know what's going on in your neighbor's life?
[11:46.070 --> 11:47.050]  You want to know what they've got going on?
[11:47.050 --> 11:48.670]  You want to know, how did they afford that new truck?
[11:49.530 --> 11:50.790]  What's the car payment on that thing?
[11:50.950 --> 11:51.470]  That's ridiculous.
[11:52.010 --> 11:54.250]  Maybe pop on over to their mailbox when they're out to the store.
[11:54.250 --> 11:55.290]  Grab some of their mail.
[11:55.390 --> 11:56.530]  You can open it right up.
[11:56.730 --> 11:58.370]  And then, I'm going to guess...
[11:59.710 --> 12:00.630]  Yeah, yeah.
[12:03.230 --> 12:03.970]  Closes right back up.
[12:04.230 --> 12:04.770]  Just like that.
[12:04.850 --> 12:05.530]  It's like brand new.
[12:05.570 --> 12:06.150]  They would never know.
[12:06.270 --> 12:07.030]  None the wiser.
[12:09.290 --> 12:10.470]  Tell me there's a difference.
[12:12.630 --> 12:14.190]  Well, it won't be hot forever.
[12:15.110 --> 12:15.770]  That's pretty good.
[12:18.910 --> 12:22.430]  Well, I would say that not only does it do what it purports to do...
[12:22.430 --> 12:24.410]  It does a whole lot else as well.
[12:24.890 --> 12:28.630]  So, this is going to be the first item we put in our Hall of Do.
[12:33.150 --> 12:34.310]  We'll superimpose that in, too.
[12:44.110 --> 12:48.990]  Now, Gavin, you and I have to get to work on a laptop ironing board.
[12:49.370 --> 12:50.930]  So, we'll see you next time.
[12:52.150 --> 12:56.270]  We're Geoff and Gavin, and we're very excited for you to check out our new show,
[12:56.270 --> 13:01.690]  Does It Do?, where we determine if the products you see on television,
[13:01.870 --> 13:04.590]  or the internet, or social media actually do...
[13:04.590 --> 13:05.870]  You want to know what's going on in your neighbor's life?
[13:05.950 --> 13:07.370]  What they say they're going to do.
[13:07.470 --> 13:09.170]  Let's see if we can clean the babe up.
[13:09.470 --> 13:11.350]  Tune in, because it's going to be fun.
[13:11.810 --> 13:13.170]  I broke my ass.
