[00:10.890 --> 00:11.850]  And action!
[00:12.850 --> 00:14.410]  I thought we were already in action.
[00:15.670 --> 00:16.950]  Gavin, this is your idea.
[00:18.270 --> 00:24.170]  HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE F***ING FACE CHILDHOOD ADS DRAFT.
[00:25.270 --> 00:28.630]  This one was my suggestion. It's the only one I've been responsible for.
[00:29.690 --> 00:29.990]  Hello.
[00:30.850 --> 00:32.230]  Do you think that puts pressure on you, Gavin?
[00:32.350 --> 00:34.490]  Shot out of a cannon with that intro.
[00:34.570 --> 00:38.790]  Do you feel any intensity that you have to perform well? Because this is your idea.
[00:38.790 --> 00:40.230]  You've got a bunch of bullshit ads.
[00:40.890 --> 00:42.010]  Why did you do this?
[00:43.510 --> 00:47.810]  Do you not have ads that you watched as a kid that have been burned into your memory for several decades?
[00:48.030 --> 00:48.470]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:49.190 --> 00:52.170]  Yeah, I feel like we've all got some of those. Perfect for a draft.
[00:52.650 --> 00:56.190]  This was probably harder to narrow down than my favorite mall stores.
[00:56.410 --> 00:58.770]  There's a lot of childhood ads out there.
[00:58.950 --> 01:01.390]  I found this almost as difficult as the crisps.
[01:01.810 --> 01:01.990]  Yeah.
[01:02.130 --> 01:02.510]  Really?
[01:03.130 --> 01:03.990]  Crisp was hard too.
[01:04.470 --> 01:06.670]  Can you explain how the draft works, Gavin?
[01:09.270 --> 01:12.390]  The pool... the pool is ads.
[01:12.730 --> 01:13.050]  Okay.
[01:13.310 --> 01:13.950]  And, uh...
[01:13.950 --> 01:14.650]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:15.570 --> 01:18.510]  Ads specifically to each of our own childhoods.
[01:18.950 --> 01:21.830]  Well, it could be... we might have shared a childhood ad.
[01:22.330 --> 01:22.890]  That's true.
[01:23.090 --> 01:23.950]  That's why it's a draft.
[01:24.270 --> 01:28.050]  You grew up in a different nation. Andrew grew up in a different nation.
[01:28.410 --> 01:30.090]  Geoff grew up in a different decade.
[01:30.330 --> 01:34.210]  So you're right. Me and Nick might have some childhood ads that overlap each other.
[01:34.210 --> 01:38.890]  I'm gonna be so fucking confused if Gavin or Andrew picks one of my ads.
[01:40.550 --> 01:46.510]  I assumed I couldn't pick out of my own childhood. That I couldn't just go crazy and pick someone else's childhood ad that was popular.
[01:48.090 --> 01:53.450]  Also, when is the cutoff for childhood? I had a real dilemma where there was an ad I thought of, but I was 13 when it came out.
[01:53.970 --> 01:56.590]  I'll be honest. Some of mine are from the 2000s.
[01:56.670 --> 01:57.810]  I was born in the 80s.
[01:58.050 --> 02:01.330]  I think a childhood ad goes until you get a driver's license.
[02:01.830 --> 02:03.530]  Well, that's fucked for Gavin.
[02:03.530 --> 02:05.530]  I saw an ad yesterday that was...
[02:07.590 --> 02:10.650]  I'm sorry. Until the average person gets a driver's license.
[02:10.670 --> 02:12.330]  Gavin is still a child.
[02:13.170 --> 02:15.250]  I'm glad we all agree on that anyway.
[02:15.910 --> 02:17.630]  Let's figure out who goes first.
[02:18.890 --> 02:21.230]  Do you want to explain how we figure out who goes first?
[02:21.450 --> 02:23.330]  So we're randomizing. Oh, Gavin.
[02:23.750 --> 02:26.550]  Eric is currently typing names into a randomizer.
[02:27.350 --> 02:30.850]  And that will determine the list. It's a snake draft, everyone. It's a snake.
[02:30.850 --> 02:33.590]  How many randoms are we going to do?
[02:33.650 --> 02:34.830]  Last time we did a few.
[02:35.390 --> 02:36.750]  We did five last time.
[02:36.930 --> 02:37.890]  We should do at least five.
[02:38.410 --> 02:39.750]  Okay, five randoms.
[02:40.710 --> 02:42.350]  And four ads each, yeah?
[02:42.730 --> 02:42.930]  Yeah.
[02:43.670 --> 02:44.150]  Excellent.
[02:44.810 --> 02:45.130]  Perfect.
[02:45.910 --> 02:46.890]  Here's one random.
[02:48.570 --> 02:51.630]  It is Geoff, Nick, Eric, Andrew, Gavin.
[02:52.690 --> 02:53.510]  Second random.
[02:54.250 --> 02:56.630]  Nick, Gavin, Geoff, Eric, Andrew.
[02:56.830 --> 02:57.670]  I want to be in the back.
[02:57.670 --> 02:58.730]  I want to be five.
[02:59.270 --> 02:59.630]  Third random.
[03:00.390 --> 03:02.670]  Geoff, Gavin, Nick, Eric, Andrew.
[03:02.910 --> 03:03.850]  Oh, maintain.
[03:04.550 --> 03:04.890]  Fourth.
[03:05.190 --> 03:07.270]  Geoff, Gavin, Andrew, Eric, Nick.
[03:07.630 --> 03:09.090]  That only changed the last three.
[03:09.470 --> 03:11.270]  I will call this, this is classic order.
[03:12.210 --> 03:12.690]  Gagain?
[03:14.010 --> 03:14.970]  That's classic.
[03:15.410 --> 03:16.310]  Classic gagain.
[03:16.750 --> 03:19.970]  And now our fifth and final random.
[03:20.670 --> 03:21.430]  What if it's an egg?
[03:21.550 --> 03:22.110]  Back, back, back, back.
[03:22.110 --> 03:23.810]  Andrew, Geoff, Gavin, Eric, Nick.
[03:23.810 --> 03:24.910]  No, it's the opposite.
[03:24.910 --> 03:26.710]  Also, I've now won two of these in a row.
[03:27.510 --> 03:27.830]  Fuck.
[03:28.750 --> 03:29.390]  Damn, Andrew.
[03:29.690 --> 03:31.570]  Alright, well, the pressure's on you, buddy.
[03:31.730 --> 03:32.430]  Yeah, that, yeah.
[03:33.150 --> 03:34.150]  Well, you know what actually I do?
[03:34.210 --> 03:35.710]  I like I have the swing on the back end.
[03:36.330 --> 03:37.770]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna start it out.
[03:37.890 --> 03:38.830]  I think I got a banger.
[03:38.970 --> 03:40.530]  I think I got a strong first ad.
[03:40.990 --> 03:42.730]  And then it's gonna be quiet for a while.
[03:43.210 --> 03:46.090]  Oh, if you are, if you're listening to this, by the way,
[03:46.430 --> 03:51.650]  you can go on the F*** Face YouTube channel and we'll have all these ads posted along.
[03:51.730 --> 03:54.390]  So there'll be, in a video version, we'll have all these ads as well.
[03:54.390 --> 03:56.850]  Yeah, our drafts are typically better in video.
[03:57.590 --> 04:01.150]  So we're gonna post the actual ads that are in the video?
[04:01.290 --> 04:03.170]  Yeah, I'm not worried about it.
[04:03.170 --> 04:05.370]  I'm not worried about it because it's a commercial.
[04:05.630 --> 04:08.870]  I'm not worried about it either. Let's fucking do it, baby. That's awesome.
[04:09.210 --> 04:09.510]  Okay.
[04:10.990 --> 04:12.570]  Ask forgiveness later.
[04:12.770 --> 04:15.050]  Okay, so do I talk about it now or do I wait until later?
[04:15.090 --> 04:17.890]  Yeah, I would give a little intro for it and then Eric can press play.
[04:18.090 --> 04:23.970]  So this was a dairy farm ad that played continuously during my childhood.
[04:23.970 --> 04:29.970]  They attempted to try to make milk cooled to the kids in, like, late 90s, early 2000s.
[04:30.630 --> 04:35.390]  This is the milk wrap. Look out for a time-traveling Rocco Bote as one of the crew.
[04:35.990 --> 04:36.570]  Get ready.
[04:36.750 --> 04:37.590]  I'm excited. Okay.
[04:37.750 --> 04:38.270]  Here we go.
[04:38.350 --> 04:39.390]  Alright, here we go.
[04:41.510 --> 04:42.710]  Oh yeah, there he is.
[04:49.270 --> 04:49.670]  Wow.
[04:50.230 --> 04:50.870]  You know what you want.
[04:50.890 --> 04:51.490]  That's Rocco.
[04:51.750 --> 04:52.450]  Yeah, it is.
[05:00.030 --> 05:01.010]  They're chilling.
[05:05.390 --> 05:07.170]  Now this is on all the time.
[05:08.950 --> 05:10.210]  This is insane.
[05:10.670 --> 05:12.630]  So this is Letter Kimmy.
[05:13.210 --> 05:13.430]  Yeah.
[05:13.990 --> 05:14.730]  Kind of, yeah.
[05:14.910 --> 05:15.990]  Everybody keeps talking about.
[05:19.130 --> 05:21.530]  Boy, it just keeps going, huh?
[05:21.810 --> 05:22.370]  Yep.
[05:22.770 --> 05:23.850]  That's the whole thing.
[05:24.770 --> 05:27.530]  They really needed two verses to convey how cool it is.
[05:29.530 --> 05:30.410]  Jesus Christ.
[05:33.850 --> 05:34.290]  No.
[05:34.670 --> 05:35.890]  That guy's making out with a cow.
[05:36.950 --> 05:44.410]  I am lactose intolerant, so this was... I felt especially left out by how cool the milk was that I couldn't consume.
[05:44.830 --> 05:44.970]  Yep.
[05:45.410 --> 05:47.930]  I still... that song will get stuck in my head to this day.
[05:47.990 --> 05:52.470]  I will open the fridge and think straight through your bones from the farm to the fridge.
[05:52.470 --> 05:56.670]  I'm imagining the fridge light hitting you in the face and you just start nodding along.
[05:57.250 --> 05:58.130]  Yeah, absolutely.
[05:58.730 --> 06:01.570]  I like when the milk hit the pan as a part of the beat.
[06:02.030 --> 06:02.270]  Uh-huh.
[06:02.490 --> 06:04.050]  It's a key part of the experience.
[06:04.550 --> 06:08.850]  Man, I fear that you've set a high bar.
[06:10.050 --> 06:12.270]  My childhood wasn't nearly as interesting.
[06:12.710 --> 06:17.350]  I'll be honest, I cannot believe how this relates to my first pick. I'm so excited.
[06:18.770 --> 06:21.110]  Andrew, can I ask, was that a song you guys sang at school?
[06:21.790 --> 06:26.750]  Uh, no, you know, I don't think I ever heard it in school, but everybody heard that song probably 10,000 more times.
[06:26.990 --> 06:28.730]  Did you know all the lyrics when you were a kid?
[06:28.730 --> 06:28.930]  Yeah.
[06:28.990 --> 06:29.690]  Could you sing it to yourself?
[06:30.270 --> 06:31.330]  Uh-huh, 100%.
[06:31.330 --> 06:36.310]  Uh, that song was probably heard more than the national anthem if you grew up during the time I grew up.
[06:36.450 --> 06:39.530]  It's constant. Constantly sing that at.
[06:39.710 --> 06:40.990]  Did Roseanne ever sing it?
[06:42.650 --> 06:43.010]  Um...
[06:43.010 --> 06:45.810]  That's why I ran out of Canada for singing that, yeah.
[06:47.310 --> 06:52.730]  Well, good first pick. Next up, we have Geoff. You ready, Geoff?
[06:53.130 --> 06:54.830]  Yeah, let me give an intro, I guess.
[06:55.450 --> 07:03.690]  When I was a kid, this was a commercial that played on TV a lot, and I watched it a bunch, and I enjoyed it.
[07:03.790 --> 07:06.850]  If you were a kid when I was a kid, you did the same thing.
[07:07.290 --> 07:12.730]  It became a part of the cultural zeitgeist. All of mine, I think, have cultural zeitgeist ties to it.
[07:12.730 --> 07:16.450]  And it became spoofed on SNL and a lot of stuff.
[07:16.790 --> 07:20.830]  It's one of those commercials, they probably made four or five of them in the little series,
[07:21.010 --> 07:23.710]  and then it was spoofed for the next 15 years.
[07:24.570 --> 07:28.530]  There's no rapping, and I feel like it's going to be let down after Andrews. Here we go!
[07:30.650 --> 07:32.470]  It certainly is a big bun.
[07:32.650 --> 07:34.210]  It's a very big bun.
[07:34.350 --> 07:35.590]  Big fluffy bun.
[07:35.770 --> 07:38.110]  It's a very big fluffy... bun.
[07:39.010 --> 07:39.670]  Where's the beef?
[07:43.470 --> 07:44.410]  Where's the beef?
[07:49.970 --> 07:53.970]  Hey, where's the beef?
[07:55.710 --> 07:58.990]  You want something better? You're Wendy's kind of people.
[07:59.490 --> 08:00.130]  There you go.
[08:00.730 --> 08:02.310]  Clara Peller. Fantastic.
[08:02.930 --> 08:04.850]  That is the where's the beef lady.
[08:05.390 --> 08:08.690]  She became famous for that for the rest of her life.
[08:08.930 --> 08:11.410]  Did she wears the beef in other commercials?
[08:12.030 --> 08:13.910]  Oh, well, other Wendy's commercials, yeah.
[08:14.090 --> 08:17.090]  And then there were like spoofs, it was in sitcoms.
[08:17.790 --> 08:22.710]  Once where's the beef hit the market, it became a slogan that lasted 25 years.
[08:23.050 --> 08:26.370]  I like it when companies call out other companies by name.
[08:26.530 --> 08:28.530]  They shout on the Whopper and the Big Mac.
[08:28.870 --> 08:29.370]  Yeah, they did.
[08:31.410 --> 08:33.850]  Now when you say the rest of her life, did you mean two summers?
[08:33.850 --> 08:36.970]  For the next 18 months that she was alive.
[08:37.230 --> 08:39.390]  She was 104 when she recorded that.
[08:41.370 --> 08:43.650]  What year do you think she died, if you had to guess?
[08:46.330 --> 08:46.810]  1988.
[08:47.690 --> 08:49.670]  I'm going to guess she died in 1996.
[08:50.650 --> 08:51.130]  Gavin?
[08:52.870 --> 08:53.350]  97.
[08:54.030 --> 08:55.190]  No, no, summer of 98.
[08:55.530 --> 08:57.610]  Alright, bummer. That was almost...
[08:57.610 --> 08:58.210]  That's pretty good.
[08:58.550 --> 08:59.930]  87, so she got...
[09:01.150 --> 09:02.470]  Oh, fuck, she got three years.
[09:02.470 --> 09:04.430]  Yeah, she got three summers.
[09:04.950 --> 09:08.210]  I wonder if that campaign only ended because she ended.
[09:08.830 --> 09:09.230]  Probably.
[09:10.550 --> 09:12.730]  I never shared the planet with her.
[09:13.170 --> 09:13.350]  Nope.
[09:13.710 --> 09:14.730]  No, you never did.
[09:15.050 --> 09:16.290]  You think she ever found the beef?
[09:16.970 --> 09:17.310]  Oh, yeah.
[09:17.350 --> 09:18.570]  Yeah, every time she went to Wendy's she did.
[09:18.570 --> 09:19.530]  Well, she found it at Wendy's, yeah.
[09:19.550 --> 09:19.970]  Absolutely.
[09:21.050 --> 09:23.330]  Okay, cool. Next up we have Gavin.
[09:23.990 --> 09:26.950]  Okay, are you familiar with UAR?
[09:28.010 --> 09:28.490]  No.
[09:28.710 --> 09:29.090]  What?
[09:29.330 --> 09:29.690]  No.
[09:31.650 --> 09:32.250]  UAR.
[09:32.710 --> 09:33.490]  What is UAR?
[09:34.230 --> 09:35.930]  It's what farmers say, right?
[09:35.970 --> 09:40.150]  And are you also familiar with the song Go West by the Village People?
[09:40.890 --> 09:41.350]  Yes.
[09:41.610 --> 09:42.050]  Yes.
[09:42.250 --> 09:46.750]  Which I assume is a song about travelling west across the US.
[09:47.190 --> 09:54.570]  What they've done here is they've parodied it by advertising a rice pudding in a can called Ambrosia.
[09:54.570 --> 10:02.390]  And instead of going west across America, it's the West Country of England where farmers are known to say UAR.
[10:04.190 --> 10:09.490]  What is that? Are they Brummies? Are they Mancs? Like, what's their... how do you call those things?
[10:09.490 --> 10:11.830]  They're like from Dorset. They're from the West Country.
[10:12.210 --> 10:13.610]  So are they called like Dordors?
[10:14.250 --> 10:15.250]  They're Dordors, yeah.
[10:15.550 --> 10:15.930]  Yeah, okay.
[10:17.110 --> 10:20.570]  I like this because one of the lines is, if you like rice pud...
[10:23.700 --> 10:24.620]  Go ahead and play it.
[10:24.680 --> 10:25.600]  And here's your commercial.
[10:26.880 --> 10:31.690]  Oh wow.
[10:34.230 --> 10:34.830]  Man.
[10:39.400 --> 10:41.980]  There's something uncomfortable about this.
[10:44.000 --> 10:45.520]  What's up with his voice?
[11:04.250 --> 11:10.030]  UAR! It's Ambrosia! UAR! It's Ambrosia!
[11:10.450 --> 11:12.130]  It's 28 weeks later?
[11:15.710 --> 11:26.350]  I've had the image of a man sat on a cow saying UAR! It's Ambrosia! for at least 25 years. Burned into my mind.
[11:26.650 --> 11:29.450]  Apparently we can do a milk draft on Justin.
[11:30.210 --> 11:30.850]  Yeah, really!
[11:31.930 --> 11:35.870]  Because we had milk, it does a body good. I did not include that in my campaign.
[11:36.090 --> 11:37.870]  You didn't have UAR! It's Ambrosia?
[11:39.630 --> 11:45.190]  No, we had Michael Jordan with a jizz stache going, hey man, you can dunk me.
[11:45.430 --> 11:46.830]  That wasn't milk, that was rice pud.
[11:47.430 --> 11:51.230]  Yeah, and he said so. He said specifically rice pud.
[11:52.030 --> 11:53.530]  Very song centric so far.
[11:53.570 --> 11:54.450]  Yeah, I'm enjoying the parodies.
[11:55.450 --> 12:05.690]  Yeah, mine isn't really parody, but it is song centric as I pull this over here.
[12:06.210 --> 12:10.670]  Mine is one that I've heard a million times and has woken me up even more.
[12:12.030 --> 12:16.650]  This is my simple commercial and my first pick in this draft.
[12:17.290 --> 12:20.070]  Oh, I remember this!
[12:24.450 --> 12:27.130]  A world where music toys you.
[12:32.010 --> 12:34.290]  Experience pure worlds.
[12:34.510 --> 12:37.450]  The perfect soundtrack for your way of life.
[12:41.210 --> 12:42.550]  Direct from Europe.
[12:43.030 --> 12:44.310]  This multi-platinum collection...
[12:44.310 --> 12:45.810]  Oh, Crockett's theme!
[12:47.490 --> 12:50.990]  But be careful, it's scary. It's gonna get scary.
[12:52.250 --> 12:53.230]  It's gonna get scary.
[12:54.030 --> 12:54.790]  Oh, no!
[13:00.550 --> 13:04.230]  No other collection gives you the feeling of pure moods.
[13:05.890 --> 13:09.030]  To order Pure Moods, call the number on your screen.
[13:09.430 --> 13:11.710]  Can we order Pure Moods?
[13:12.390 --> 13:15.010]  Somebody call the number, we need to order Pure Moods.
[13:16.730 --> 13:19.550]  Goddamn, Eric, that took me back, man.
[13:19.550 --> 13:24.850]  So, Pure Moods, for me, is a...
[13:24.850 --> 13:31.690]  If you were falling asleep with the TV on, the beginning of that commercial...
[13:33.090 --> 13:36.130]  It wakes you up in a cold sweat.
[13:36.330 --> 13:38.070]  Every night, 2.15.
[13:38.830 --> 13:48.410]  I had the exact same ad in England, but maybe without as much Twin Peaks and with more Faithless, but it was the exact same style, maybe with a different name.
[13:48.410 --> 13:51.870]  But, yeah, that hit me right in the brainstem. That activated something.
[13:52.310 --> 13:54.690]  Yeah, that was a great one, Eric.
[13:54.970 --> 14:01.950]  It really makes me appreciate those CD commercials. I loved those, and that was just a really good one.
[14:02.070 --> 14:03.050]  Like Freedom Rock?
[14:03.310 --> 14:05.530]  I just think they're so fun.
[14:05.550 --> 14:10.690]  I like this because you need those adverts to know what the songs are called, because you'll never get it from hearing the song.
[14:11.530 --> 14:12.850]  Except for maybe India.
[14:14.290 --> 14:14.490]  Yep.
[14:14.490 --> 14:23.110]  Man, Eric, that's a commercial I had forgotten existed. The second you played it, I knew every line of it, and I've probably seen it 10,000 times. That's wild.
[14:24.450 --> 14:25.490]  100%. Absolutely.
[14:25.830 --> 14:26.410]  That's awesome.
[14:26.910 --> 14:29.670]  Okay, well, that's mine. And here is...
[14:29.670 --> 14:30.610]  Everybody's favorite Nick.
[14:30.890 --> 14:33.570]  The final first round pick is Nick.
[14:34.650 --> 14:35.690]  You freak.
[14:36.210 --> 14:36.410]  What?
[14:36.910 --> 14:39.530]  This is a great commercial. This commercial made me appraised.
[14:40.770 --> 14:42.310]  You've got to be kidding me.
[14:42.310 --> 14:45.030]  Yard work. But let's bring it back to milk.
[14:45.830 --> 14:46.210]  Okay.
[14:46.430 --> 14:51.530]  Drink your milk, kids. I don't want milk. Milk's for babies.
[14:52.390 --> 14:53.550]  Yeah, babies.
[14:54.110 --> 14:58.570]  Well, I happen to know that milk helps build strong bones. So drink up.
[14:59.350 --> 15:02.690]  Well, Mr. Miller told me he never drinks milk. Look at him.
[15:03.170 --> 15:03.470]  Yeah.
[15:04.750 --> 15:05.430]  Drink it.
[15:17.650 --> 15:18.890]  Oh, my God.
[15:19.110 --> 15:20.290]  It's so simple.
[15:20.570 --> 15:21.750]  It's such a good one.
[15:21.930 --> 15:23.190]  That's so great.
[15:24.370 --> 15:26.690]  I think I might have been traumatized as a kid, man.
[15:26.690 --> 15:27.730]  Was that actually on TV?
[15:28.870 --> 15:29.170]  Yeah.
[15:30.990 --> 15:32.450]  It's a cow milk commercial, man.
[15:32.450 --> 15:32.770]  All right.
[15:35.910 --> 15:37.310]  Milk farmers know what they're doing.
[15:37.610 --> 15:39.290]  I don't think I've ever seen that before.
[15:39.710 --> 15:40.370]  It's so good.
[15:42.550 --> 15:44.670]  It definitely gets the message across when you're a kid.
[15:44.810 --> 15:45.390]  That's for sure.
[15:45.650 --> 15:50.710]  I would be convinced I was going to die as someone who couldn't drink milk.
[15:50.850 --> 15:53.330]  I'd just be like, I'm fucked. I'm dead. It's over.
[15:54.570 --> 15:55.330]  What do you do?
[15:56.470 --> 15:58.330]  Well, that's a great...
[15:58.330 --> 16:02.610]  Our first round is very milk focused, but it's good. It's a good first round.
[16:03.210 --> 16:07.350]  And now we move on to our second round, and that'll be Nick.
[16:08.270 --> 16:08.850]  Well, hello again.
[16:08.850 --> 16:14.770]  So this one takes me back to a simpler time, as probably most of these will.
[16:15.030 --> 16:22.030]  But I'll always remember Super Smash Brothers, the game, because of this particular ad.
[16:22.630 --> 16:22.910]  Yep.
[16:24.470 --> 16:26.390]  Great one. Awesome pick.
[16:26.590 --> 16:27.310]  I love this one.
[16:27.970 --> 16:29.330]  Absolutely a great pick.
[16:30.650 --> 16:32.110]  How peaceful. How nice.
[16:32.810 --> 16:34.010]  Oh, God.
[16:36.130 --> 16:37.710]  Oh, my God.
[16:38.490 --> 16:40.990]  Nick is so good at drafts.
[16:40.990 --> 16:42.090]  Have you guys noticed that?
[16:42.810 --> 16:44.110]  Yeah. Thank you.
[16:44.470 --> 16:45.290]  I feel good about this one.
[16:47.350 --> 16:53.870]  I remember thinking about this commercial all the time when I was a kid.
[16:54.110 --> 16:56.630]  How much fun must that have been to film?
[16:57.150 --> 16:58.910]  It must have been the best, right?
[16:59.470 --> 17:04.130]  Like, that commercial is awesome. The song is such a great pick for it.
[17:04.350 --> 17:07.450]  Everyone fighting, it's great. That is a good one, dude.
[17:07.710 --> 17:09.190]  You think that was awesome to film?
[17:09.370 --> 17:12.110]  I guarantee you those actors couldn't breathe in those costumes.
[17:12.390 --> 17:14.070]  It was 104 degrees outside.
[17:14.290 --> 17:18.910]  They had to run up and down that hill 1,800 times, and they were miserable.
[17:19.790 --> 17:21.310]  Right, but I'm not considering that.
[17:21.430 --> 17:25.470]  I'm considering being behind the camera and watching Pikachu fly around at you.
[17:26.330 --> 17:26.970]  Yeah, I get you.
[17:27.210 --> 17:30.210]  Hey, Yoshi, could you go in harder with that gut shot on Donkey Kong?
[17:33.870 --> 17:35.690]  I'm just relieved Conor McGregor wasn't there.
[17:35.690 --> 17:37.810]  He would've never got a game. He would've died.
[17:38.350 --> 17:39.070]  Go to the hospital.
[17:41.030 --> 17:44.350]  Okay, cool. So I have the next pick, my second round.
[17:45.330 --> 17:46.390]  I'll put it here.
[17:46.910 --> 17:47.590]  Don't blow this.
[17:48.290 --> 17:52.410]  It's one that I've seen a million times. I know word for word.
[17:53.050 --> 17:57.890]  It was endless in my childhood, so I'm just gonna play it for you guys now.
[17:58.990 --> 18:01.310]  I cannot live another day without air conditioning.
[18:01.690 --> 18:02.810]  Tomorrow's gonna be hotter.
[18:03.130 --> 18:04.130]  Like yesterday.
[18:05.690 --> 18:07.490]  Yesterday you said you'd call Sears.
[18:07.650 --> 18:08.070]  I'll call today.
[18:08.350 --> 18:09.150]  You call now.
[18:09.590 --> 18:10.350]  I'll call now.
[18:10.710 --> 18:11.170]  Perfect.
[18:13.450 --> 18:19.610]  Why was this on Nickelodeon every commercial break when I was a kid?
[18:20.330 --> 18:21.110]  For who?
[18:21.590 --> 18:22.450]  Tell your parents you're hot.
[18:25.790 --> 18:28.670]  The end buttons it up. It tells a story.
[18:35.690 --> 18:39.950]  Sears offers fast emergency installation. A five-year warranty on parts and labor.
[18:40.150 --> 18:42.110]  Plus our satisfaction guarantee.
[18:42.470 --> 18:44.870]  And you know Sears will be there to back it up.
[18:45.230 --> 18:46.750]  Get 0% finance charge.
[18:46.770 --> 18:47.750]  Are you listening kids?
[18:47.910 --> 18:48.350]  No bills, no pay.
[18:49.330 --> 18:50.970]  Offer ends May 31st.
[18:51.050 --> 18:51.570]  So call now.
[18:51.570 --> 18:51.910]  Here it is.
[18:52.750 --> 18:54.470]  Now back to Metalocalypse.
[18:54.750 --> 18:55.830]  What's the paper say about tomorrow?
[18:56.290 --> 18:57.010]  Another scorcher.
[18:57.830 --> 18:58.070]  Cool.
[18:59.210 --> 18:59.690]  Yeah!
[19:00.970 --> 19:03.310]  It is... Nick, how many times have you seen that commercial?
[19:03.610 --> 19:04.930]  Oh, every day for...
[19:06.470 --> 19:07.570]  Oh, at least...
[19:07.570 --> 19:09.890]  That's so funny. Why would that be on Nickelodeon?
[19:09.910 --> 19:13.490]  I don't know. I've seen it so much.
[19:13.710 --> 19:16.030]  I've seen it parodied a million times.
[19:16.230 --> 19:16.910]  It's great.
[19:17.290 --> 19:18.030]  It's great.
[19:18.390 --> 19:19.290]  But that's my pick.
[19:19.490 --> 19:21.550]  So now we're back on to Gavin.
[19:22.090 --> 19:25.210]  This is probably my only pick that I assume everyone has seen.
[19:25.890 --> 19:31.050]  Are you aware of the original commercial for Xbox in Europe?
[19:31.390 --> 19:31.870]  Yes.
[19:32.010 --> 19:32.330]  Yes.
[19:32.790 --> 19:33.170]  Yes.
[19:33.270 --> 19:33.850]  All right.
[19:33.850 --> 19:35.450]  I knew you were going to pick this.
[19:47.900 --> 19:49.540]  Oh my God.
[19:57.120 --> 19:58.720]  Dude, this is insane.
[19:59.040 --> 20:00.600]  I don't know that I've ever seen this.
[20:00.600 --> 20:01.560]  You haven't seen this?
[20:06.470 --> 20:08.230]  Does he die?
[20:14.630 --> 20:15.110]  What?
[20:18.370 --> 20:20.190]  That's why you do your kegels.
[20:20.490 --> 20:21.430]  Hey, life's short, Eric.
[20:22.370 --> 20:24.050]  What the hell?
[20:25.650 --> 20:27.230]  And banned immediately.
[20:27.390 --> 20:30.510]  I think it was on TV for two weeks before I got a shitload of complaints.
[20:30.810 --> 20:31.990]  That sounds right.
[20:32.370 --> 20:34.030]  And then it was immediately taken off.
[20:34.350 --> 20:40.250]  But yeah, that was coinciding with the launch of the original Xbox in Europe.
[20:40.250 --> 20:42.070]  And I think it's phenomenal.
[20:42.350 --> 20:42.890]  Yeah.
[20:43.450 --> 20:44.490]  That's crazy.
[20:44.770 --> 20:46.730]  That is really something, man.
[20:47.630 --> 20:51.910]  It's like the shots of some guy going over the countryside of England.
[20:54.310 --> 20:57.050]  That was a hell of a pick, Gavin.
[20:57.230 --> 20:59.390]  I don't think I've never ever seen that.
[20:59.530 --> 21:00.650]  That was wild.
[21:01.110 --> 21:02.650]  What a fucking...
[21:02.650 --> 21:03.390]  When you...
[21:03.390 --> 21:04.870]  It was... a man died.
[21:05.430 --> 21:05.970]  A man died.
[21:06.630 --> 21:08.070]  I think they started strong.
[21:08.070 --> 21:11.130]  I think Xbox typically was never as cool as PlayStation.
[21:11.550 --> 21:12.810]  But I think that ad was cool.
[21:13.010 --> 21:15.150]  I think they were actually cool until it was banned.
[21:15.570 --> 21:19.050]  Did that ad like literally work on you when you were a kid?
[21:19.110 --> 21:20.430]  Where you're like, you know, life is short.
[21:20.510 --> 21:21.790]  I should play more video games.
[21:22.770 --> 21:24.810]  Well, I mean, I got an Xbox instead of a PlayStation.
[21:28.450 --> 21:33.730]  I like the idea of seeing that and then going to buy an Xbox and getting Blink's the Time Cat.
[21:33.730 --> 21:35.730]  The cost, the penalty of...
[21:38.530 --> 21:44.090]  What's sad is watching that now, I realize how far along the timeline of that guy flying over England I've actually progressed.
[21:45.570 --> 21:48.470]  That is quite worrying. Maybe I should play more Xbox.
[21:49.210 --> 21:51.030]  Good luck exploding a coffin.
[21:54.290 --> 21:57.730]  Because the 360 also had a banned ad in Europe.
[21:58.190 --> 22:02.070]  I think if you announce a new console, you've got to start with a banned ad.
[22:02.330 --> 22:03.390]  That's just how you do it.
[22:03.390 --> 22:03.970]  Smart.
[22:05.670 --> 22:08.770]  Okay, moving on to Geoff. Anything you want to say about yours, Geoff?
[22:09.410 --> 22:12.830]  This ad is actually from a little bit before I was born.
[22:13.190 --> 22:15.310]  It's from a series of ads that were very popular.
[22:15.550 --> 22:25.250]  I just couldn't find any specific ones from my childhood that weren't included in like an hour and a half long compilation where we'd have to watch 37 minutes in, you know?
[22:25.590 --> 22:26.570]  It just seemed like a pain in the ass.
[22:26.830 --> 22:29.950]  So I got what I think is the first one of this series.
[22:30.410 --> 22:32.770]  It may not mean anything to you, but it affected...
[22:32.770 --> 22:33.450]  I'll say this.
[22:34.170 --> 22:40.490]  Every child in America did this at the grocery store specifically because of this ad.
[22:40.970 --> 22:42.630]  My entire childhood I did it.
[22:42.770 --> 22:45.430]  And everybody I knew did it. We did it to be dickheads.
[22:45.750 --> 22:47.590]  We did it because the TV told us not to.
[22:48.110 --> 22:49.030]  Would Stew have done this?
[22:49.870 --> 22:50.330]  Yes.
[22:51.270 --> 22:52.210]  Okay, here it is.
[23:12.410 --> 23:14.210]  It's like Columbo's stunt man.
[23:15.670 --> 23:17.230]  Like Columbo tough guy.
[23:21.130 --> 23:22.190]  Yeah.
[23:35.930 --> 23:43.810]  Oh, Mr. Whipple.
[23:44.590 --> 23:47.810]  Even Mr. Whipple succumbed to squeezing the Charmin.
[23:50.850 --> 23:53.870]  They were just squeezing this baby's face.
[23:55.890 --> 24:00.070]  When I go to a grocery store, I still squeeze the fucking Charmin sometimes.
[24:01.190 --> 24:02.590]  Ah yeah, fuck you Whipple.
[24:04.910 --> 24:06.710]  Trying to stop our good time.
[24:07.130 --> 24:07.990]  Fuck you Whipple.
[24:09.130 --> 24:12.990]  That was way before my time, the squeeze the Charmin thing.
[24:13.150 --> 24:16.210]  But that was even something that I knew like growing up.
[24:16.370 --> 24:18.530]  It's another one of those things like where's the beef?
[24:18.730 --> 24:21.930]  It lasted from the 70s into the mid 80s.
[24:21.970 --> 24:25.070]  They were still doing new commercials with him when I was probably 9 or 10.
[24:25.290 --> 24:28.690]  Was it always budget Peter Falk as well?
[24:29.030 --> 24:36.030]  No, that was just like somebody's husband who was a little tough guy maybe in the lower rung of the mafia.
[24:36.030 --> 24:40.450]  Yeah, but it was always some situation where Mr. Whipple was like,
[24:40.530 --> 24:44.910]  Ladies, I'm begging you, don't squeeze the Charmin.
[24:45.790 --> 24:48.250]  And they're like, Mr. Whipple, it's so squeezably soft.
[24:48.650 --> 24:49.630]  And you turn around and he's squeezing.
[24:49.730 --> 24:52.370]  And they're like, Mr. Whipple, you too.
[24:52.450 --> 24:55.770]  And he's like, Oh no, I'm what I hate.
[24:56.050 --> 24:57.550]  I'm what I hate.
[25:00.690 --> 25:04.730]  Not nearly as cool as shooting a dying baby out of your vagina.
[25:05.710 --> 25:06.710]  That's pretty good.
[25:07.090 --> 25:15.010]  I'm curious if Mr. Whipple has an unreasonable hatred of bears after getting bumped by a shit-taking bear.
[25:15.110 --> 25:16.430]  That's my Charmin logo.
[25:17.010 --> 25:22.910]  I don't know if there's in between or do we know if they passed the baton to the bear?
[25:23.690 --> 25:26.450]  I think maybe they tried to toughen it up.
[25:26.610 --> 25:27.790]  Nobody squeezes a bear, right?
[25:27.950 --> 25:28.430]  Yeah.
[25:30.790 --> 25:31.270]  Smart.
[25:32.350 --> 25:37.050]  Okay, and now we've moved on to the last pick in our second round.
[25:37.130 --> 25:38.430]  And this will be Andrew.
[25:38.910 --> 25:40.670]  This is tough.
[25:41.050 --> 25:42.630]  This is a...
[25:43.170 --> 25:45.370]  Strap in, because we're going to go on a little bit of an adventure.
[25:46.550 --> 25:51.870]  We are going not just country, we're going local.
[25:52.090 --> 25:53.530]  I'm going with some local ads.
[25:54.690 --> 25:56.610]  We're going with a two-parter.
[25:56.790 --> 25:59.010]  These are going to be two different ads, my second and third pick.
[25:59.010 --> 26:05.730]  Just so you can understand the joy that it was growing up with Dodd's commercials.
[26:06.190 --> 26:07.570]  Dodd's Furniture and Mattress.
[26:08.250 --> 26:08.850]  Dodd's?
[26:09.850 --> 26:12.550]  Dodd's Furniture and Mattress, I'm posting a link right now.
[26:12.770 --> 26:17.430]  These were bed commercials, they all had a general kind of same feel to them, same vibe.
[26:17.850 --> 26:20.570]  And they're insane, so enjoy them.
[26:21.150 --> 26:22.730]  Okay, here's Dodd's.
[26:23.710 --> 26:25.710]  Space, the final frontier.
[26:26.170 --> 26:29.110]  Aye, Captain, you can choose your space with a Serda.
[26:29.950 --> 26:31.430]  Oh my god!
[26:33.910 --> 26:37.490]  Real comfort Serda mattresses let you have softer firm on the same mattress.
[26:37.890 --> 26:39.710]  Boldly dream like you never dreamed before.
[26:39.890 --> 26:40.430]  He's a triple!
[26:40.530 --> 26:42.390]  Keep on board to the side that's right for you.
[26:43.790 --> 26:44.750]  This wears.
[26:45.170 --> 26:46.750]  Captain, you won't be undersold?
[26:47.250 --> 26:47.890]  Make it soft.
[26:50.070 --> 26:51.510]  What was your choice?
[26:51.750 --> 26:52.810]  Live long and sleep.
[26:54.810 --> 26:57.950]  Andrew, Andrew. Great. Fucking. Tick.
[26:57.950 --> 26:58.990]  That's fantastic.
[26:59.610 --> 27:01.030]  Dodd's is a staple.
[27:01.470 --> 27:02.370]  You gotta love Dodd's.
[27:02.510 --> 27:04.630]  You actually saw that come on television?
[27:05.270 --> 27:08.310]  Constantly, and as you see in the top left, there's a super Dodd.
[27:08.610 --> 27:13.110]  There are, I'm gonna drop in a second link right now of another Dodd's commercial.
[27:13.690 --> 27:14.970]  This was my childhood.
[27:14.970 --> 27:17.630]  Whenever there is a new Dodd, everyone get excited.
[27:17.750 --> 27:18.810]  New Dodd is on TV.
[27:19.890 --> 27:20.850]  It's a...
[27:20.850 --> 27:21.830]  Oh man.
[27:21.910 --> 27:24.050]  That shot of them both warping onto the bed.
[27:27.210 --> 27:28.950]  That was so funny.
[27:29.290 --> 27:30.210]  That was really good.
[27:30.570 --> 27:31.950]  Get the Lincoln.
[27:32.630 --> 27:33.210]  Yeah, they're great.
[27:33.310 --> 27:35.970]  All these commercials, a lot of them are based on film parody.
[27:36.850 --> 27:39.890]  Is that him in the bottom right there as the Incredible Hulk?
[27:40.370 --> 27:41.190]  Yes, it is.
[27:41.210 --> 27:42.690]  That is a Dodd's Hulk.
[27:43.390 --> 27:44.350]  We're not going with that one.
[27:44.410 --> 27:46.750]  We're going with this one that I just put in the chat.
[27:47.850 --> 27:49.070]  Again, Dodd's Furniture.
[27:49.710 --> 27:50.150]  Yep.
[27:50.830 --> 27:51.130]  Alright.
[27:52.930 --> 27:56.870]  After 33 years of never being undersold, it was bound to happen.
[27:58.250 --> 27:59.030]  I got gas.
[27:59.390 --> 28:05.610]  If Bat Morty has so much gas, he wants to give you a $100 gas coupon to Peninsula Co-op for every purchase over $900.
[28:05.610 --> 28:07.090]  Buy a bed, get a gas card.
[28:07.250 --> 28:08.150]  I got gas.
[28:08.350 --> 28:09.130]  For the bedroom.
[28:09.590 --> 28:10.270]  I got gas.
[28:10.570 --> 28:11.430]  For the living room.
[28:11.730 --> 28:12.510]  I got gas.
[28:12.510 --> 28:13.070]  Awesome.
[28:13.730 --> 28:14.790]  Wait a second.
[28:15.030 --> 28:17.010]  This is so fucking cool.
[28:19.270 --> 28:20.410]  Chop a Dodd's...
[28:26.010 --> 28:27.890]  Why does it do that?
[28:28.070 --> 28:28.610]  Oh, Andrew.
[28:28.950 --> 28:30.770]  That was fucking great, dude.
[28:31.050 --> 28:32.390]  That's awesome, dude.
[28:32.730 --> 28:33.830]  Oh my god.
[28:36.290 --> 28:36.590]  Wow.
[28:37.690 --> 28:42.250]  It was tough for me not to just go with four different Dodd's ads for my pick.
[28:42.510 --> 28:44.630]  But yeah, that's our Dodd block.
[28:44.830 --> 28:49.890]  I hope people enjoy it and explore further on your own into the Dodd universe.
[28:50.630 --> 28:51.670]  I'm impressed.
[28:52.270 --> 28:54.310]  I think that that was really good.
[28:54.910 --> 28:56.890]  I mean, that was super Dodd-ed out.
[28:57.370 --> 28:59.150]  I love it.
[29:02.690 --> 29:04.930]  Local commercials are really something else.
[29:05.990 --> 29:07.530]  That was a very good one.
[29:07.890 --> 29:08.390]  I like this.
[29:08.710 --> 29:12.490]  In some of the I got gas shots, there's just a couple of people just moseying around.
[29:12.490 --> 29:18.450]  We should do a local commercial draft someday.
[29:18.550 --> 29:19.250]  There's so many.
[29:20.310 --> 29:21.030]  That's good.
[29:21.250 --> 29:22.370]  That's not a bad plan.
[29:22.730 --> 29:25.290]  Okay, we're moving on to Geoff now, yeah?
[29:26.030 --> 29:27.870]  Yeah, because this will be my third one.
[29:28.390 --> 29:36.370]  I'm continuing on a very specific theme here, which is ads that maybe weren't necessarily marketed towards kids,
[29:36.450 --> 29:40.550]  but that created cultural touchstones that just became bigger than the ad themselves.
[29:40.890 --> 29:41.930]  This one is the one.
[29:41.930 --> 29:42.850]  Here's another example.
[29:43.270 --> 29:45.330]  My entire childhood, this was an ad campaign.
[29:45.870 --> 29:50.850]  And as an adult, when I get up in the morning, I say this to myself or to Emily.
[29:50.950 --> 29:54.790]  And I have my entire fucking life.
[29:54.990 --> 29:57.690]  And I'd say probably four days a week, I still say this.
[29:58.170 --> 29:58.430]  Okay.
[30:01.290 --> 30:02.910]  Time to make the donuts.
[30:06.470 --> 30:07.810]  I've heard you say this.
[30:08.190 --> 30:08.790]  Yeah, man.
[30:08.790 --> 30:16.570]  The Dunkin' Donut man has to get up before everybody else so that he can stroll into Dunkin' Donuts and make the donuts.
[30:21.770 --> 30:22.870]  Wake up, asshole.
[30:24.610 --> 30:27.830]  Oh, yeah, this one, it shows the hit over and over again for some reason.
[30:29.630 --> 30:30.910]  He stops eventually.
[30:31.430 --> 30:34.190]  They just really want you to get the effect of the slap.
[30:34.930 --> 30:36.070]  It didn't add like that, did it?
[30:36.450 --> 30:36.830]  No.
[30:37.230 --> 30:37.550]  Oh, okay.
[30:38.790 --> 30:39.330]  There you go.
[30:39.390 --> 30:39.890]  Dunkin' Donuts.
[30:39.990 --> 30:41.090]  Time to make the donuts.
[30:41.790 --> 30:49.130]  Everybody in America who had to get up before the sun rose would fucking stumble around their house trying to brush their teeth and make coffee.
[30:49.270 --> 30:50.510]  Going, time to make the donuts.
[30:50.790 --> 30:51.870]  Because of that fucking dude.
[30:52.310 --> 30:53.190]  That's so funny.
[30:53.330 --> 30:55.750]  Like, the stuff that just gets burned into our brains.
[30:56.050 --> 30:56.670]  So effective.
[30:57.290 --> 31:02.690]  Again, another one that was before my time that I knew because it was just in the zeitgeist.
[31:03.090 --> 31:03.250]  Yeah.
[31:03.630 --> 31:04.890]  Okay, next one is Gavin.
[31:05.370 --> 31:06.090]  I like this one.
[31:06.090 --> 31:11.690]  Because, once again, it created a catchphrase that went way beyond the advert itself.
[31:11.950 --> 31:15.210]  And it's probably the most English advert I've ever seen.
[31:15.450 --> 31:16.110]  It's condescending.
[31:17.050 --> 31:18.870]  The guy just looks like a normal bloke.
[31:18.930 --> 31:20.250]  He's got a hole in his jumper.
[31:20.710 --> 31:22.510]  And it's pretty self-explanatory.
[31:23.190 --> 31:23.350]  Okay.
[31:25.070 --> 31:25.910]  This is a door.
[31:26.310 --> 31:28.370]  This is Ronseal quick-drying varnish.
[31:28.830 --> 31:32.810]  Brush it on and you'll have a door covered in Ronseal quick-drying varnish.
[31:33.090 --> 31:34.930]  It's touch-dry in about 20 minutes.
[31:34.930 --> 31:38.150]  So, in about 20 minutes, you can touch it and it will be dry.
[31:38.410 --> 31:40.010]  Of course, you end up with a beautiful result.
[31:40.290 --> 31:41.990]  Well, there'd be no point doing the job in the first place.
[31:42.450 --> 31:43.990]  It does exactly what it says on the tin.
[31:44.470 --> 31:46.330]  It does exactly what it says on the tin.
[31:46.590 --> 31:49.730]  It was an absolute icon of a catchphrase.
[31:49.850 --> 31:52.570]  And people use it for way more than varnishes now.
[31:52.990 --> 31:57.610]  But I just... and that guy did so many of those adverts where he's like, oh, this is a floor.
[31:57.910 --> 32:01.710]  And, you know, it's just like so dry and condescending.
[32:01.790 --> 32:02.770]  And I love him so much.
[32:02.830 --> 32:04.530]  The British are so strange.
[32:04.530 --> 32:05.130]  Yeah.
[32:05.230 --> 32:05.850]  What do you mean?
[32:06.430 --> 32:09.130]  Dude, that is like Gavin the commercial.
[32:09.510 --> 32:10.350]  Yeah, no kidding.
[32:10.710 --> 32:12.670]  That was like... that was ridiculous.
[32:13.230 --> 32:16.130]  I think that's who I wanted to be growing up was that Ronseal guy.
[32:16.590 --> 32:17.490]  Pretty fucking clear.
[32:17.990 --> 32:18.830]  Mission accomplished.
[32:19.410 --> 32:20.810]  I think that that's great.
[32:20.950 --> 32:21.470]  You're right.
[32:21.630 --> 32:23.310]  That's a guy with a hole in his jumper.
[32:23.510 --> 32:25.790]  It's also deliberate and it's great.
[32:26.010 --> 32:26.970]  It is straightforward.
[32:27.790 --> 32:30.390]  And those things must have taken like eight minutes to fill.
[32:30.730 --> 32:31.210]  Maybe.
[32:31.450 --> 32:32.550]  Maybe eight minutes.
[32:32.830 --> 32:33.730]  Say the line.
[32:33.730 --> 32:34.610]  Do we need another take?
[32:34.710 --> 32:35.450]  No, we got it.
[32:35.690 --> 32:36.090]  Oh, OK.
[32:36.550 --> 32:38.090]  Does exactly what it says on the tin.
[32:38.210 --> 32:38.330]  Yeah.
[32:41.090 --> 32:41.790]  Oh, man.
[32:42.750 --> 32:46.050]  OK, well, mine, my third pick.
[32:46.710 --> 32:50.370]  I don't know how many of you guys are going to know this, but this is one that I sing
[32:50.370 --> 32:52.450]  to myself almost every day.
[32:52.570 --> 32:53.490]  So I'm just going to play it.
[32:57.370 --> 32:58.410]  Oh, damn it.
[33:07.230 --> 33:08.670]  I love this commercial.
[33:08.710 --> 33:09.230]  I'm dancing.
[33:09.230 --> 33:13.490]  I will make a bigger salary.
[33:13.690 --> 33:17.930]  So now I've got to see which college is right for me.
[33:18.050 --> 33:22.230]  I went on the internet and found Education Connection.
[33:23.210 --> 33:25.910]  I took a free test to find out my connection.
[33:25.910 --> 33:29.110]  This played all day, every day.
[33:29.970 --> 33:31.490]  I get free on my own time.
[33:31.590 --> 33:35.690]  Education Connection matched me with the right college for free.
[33:35.890 --> 33:36.480]  Get connected.
[33:37.050 --> 33:38.490]  Why did somebody make this song?
[33:42.400 --> 33:46.400]  So if you put the draft 15 years later, whatever.
[33:46.700 --> 33:49.180]  I don't think I've ever seen that commercial before.
[33:49.400 --> 33:52.300]  Oh, you weren't watching daytime TV in 2004.
[33:52.980 --> 33:56.260]  This is all free success kit.
[33:56.460 --> 33:58.060]  Yeah, none of it is.
[33:58.140 --> 34:02.820]  It's that in this the Everest College guy or he's not my last pick.
[34:03.080 --> 34:06.080]  But Everest College is such a runner up for me.
[34:06.160 --> 34:07.720]  I almost put it on and I didn't.
[34:07.780 --> 34:08.600]  It's so good.
[34:08.600 --> 34:11.380]  Why is it just a search engine for colleges?
[34:11.860 --> 34:12.420]  Is it just Google?
[34:12.980 --> 34:17.140]  Yeah, but Google doesn't have a free success kit.
[34:17.540 --> 34:18.400]  That's true. It's worth $100.
[34:18.920 --> 34:25.460]  Yeah, but that girl singing that song, all the graphics, it was just like, man, inescapable.
[34:25.640 --> 34:28.100]  I love that. I love that commercial.
[34:28.340 --> 34:35.460]  I love the era of time where the internet was fresh enough that it warranted people standing on top of the internet while they were talking.
[34:38.140 --> 34:39.820]  Here's what the web page looks like.
[34:39.840 --> 34:41.040]  Oh, OK, great.
[34:43.400 --> 34:44.660]  Oh, all right.
[34:44.940 --> 34:46.660]  Onto Nick with his third pick.
[34:47.160 --> 34:58.000]  All right. So this speaking of songs, this is one that features a song that gets stuck in your head, but also features people who are put in situations and given a product that would never actually solve them.
[34:58.060 --> 34:59.320]  And yet it always seemed to.
[35:01.100 --> 35:03.080]  Oh, great pick.
[35:03.080 --> 35:05.080]  Oh, so good.
[35:05.700 --> 35:07.460]  This song is so catchy.
[35:08.800 --> 35:10.540]  Oh, no, his suit!
[35:13.160 --> 35:14.180]  Nick, his suit!
[35:16.760 --> 35:19.260]  Wait a second. Look at this lunatic.
[35:22.120 --> 35:24.500]  Now he's just covered in paint.
[35:24.800 --> 35:25.500]  Pinstripe!
[35:30.300 --> 35:32.140]  I always like the one where the person.
[35:32.360 --> 35:32.780]  Oh, shit.
[35:32.900 --> 35:33.640]  Oh, that was scary.
[35:33.900 --> 35:37.060]  Well, the person goes through the car at the stop line.
[35:37.080 --> 35:40.060]  Did you ever see the Foo Fighters video that parodies that?
[35:40.440 --> 35:41.480]  Like all those commercials?
[35:42.180 --> 35:42.860]  No, no.
[35:43.340 --> 35:46.080]  They did a music video for Big Me.
[35:46.480 --> 35:47.960]  I think it was like one of their first songs.
[35:48.020 --> 35:49.840]  And it's just a big Mentos parody.
[35:50.100 --> 35:51.680]  And it's it's good.
[35:51.920 --> 35:53.280]  When I see those, I think of that.
[35:53.980 --> 35:56.160]  Oh, zoo books in the bottom right.
[35:56.240 --> 35:57.220]  I remember those.
[35:57.300 --> 35:57.580]  Damn.
[35:58.680 --> 35:59.160]  Camels.
[35:59.500 --> 36:01.320]  I wonder if that's somebody's fourth pick.
[36:01.500 --> 36:02.880]  Nick, do you have a fourth pick?
[36:03.020 --> 36:03.980]  I do.
[36:04.280 --> 36:04.900]  Here it is.
[36:04.920 --> 36:06.780]  There's a lot of back and forth on this one.
[36:07.080 --> 36:08.180]  But I'm going back.
[36:09.460 --> 36:12.220]  Almost picked this one.
[36:12.380 --> 36:13.420]  This is my favorite.
[36:25.660 --> 36:26.440]  Chihuahua twitch.
[36:29.280 --> 36:30.340]  Wait a second.
[36:30.520 --> 36:32.200]  He wasn't going to the girl Chihuahua?
[36:34.560 --> 36:35.140]  Yeah.
[36:37.900 --> 36:40.020]  Look at how good that looks.
[36:42.060 --> 36:44.480]  What? Hang on.
[36:45.900 --> 36:46.960]  Is that Buster?
[36:48.020 --> 36:48.760]  Oh my God.
[36:50.100 --> 36:51.620]  It's Tony Hale.
[36:52.020 --> 36:52.160]  What?
[36:52.780 --> 36:54.420]  Dude, you're right. That is Tony Hale.
[36:54.440 --> 36:54.820]  What?
[36:56.040 --> 36:57.540]  I can't believe that.
[36:57.540 --> 36:59.120]  That's Buster from Arrested Development.
[37:00.540 --> 37:01.820]  Oh my God, that is him.
[37:02.340 --> 37:03.500]  Is it really him?
[37:04.380 --> 37:05.640]  Yeah, that's definitely him.
[37:06.060 --> 37:07.000]  That's crazy.
[37:07.420 --> 37:07.860]  Wow.
[37:08.500 --> 37:09.940]  He popped up on the screen and I went,
[37:10.140 --> 37:11.140]  well, it kind of looks like him.
[37:11.440 --> 37:13.640]  And then it was this close up and I went,
[37:13.760 --> 37:14.440]  that's him.
[37:14.720 --> 37:16.160]  The eyes, I can see it.
[37:17.340 --> 37:18.840]  He was pretty dashing back then.
[37:19.260 --> 37:19.980]  That's crazy.
[37:20.560 --> 37:24.320]  You know the dog was voiced by one of the guys from Reno 911?
[37:24.600 --> 37:24.940]  Yeah.
[37:25.520 --> 37:26.020]  Isn't that crazy?
[37:26.020 --> 37:27.200]  Was it really?
[37:27.400 --> 37:27.800]  What a weird career.
[37:28.080 --> 37:28.580]  Seriously.
[37:29.420 --> 37:31.560]  What an absolutely crazy career.
[37:32.160 --> 37:32.680]  Oh man.
[37:34.320 --> 37:35.740]  They clearly went,
[37:35.840 --> 37:38.600]  how are we going to show the dog going up a ladder?
[37:39.020 --> 37:40.080]  POV? That'll do it.
[37:41.440 --> 37:43.500]  Yeah, don't worry. You're the dog. It's fine.
[37:47.360 --> 37:48.680]  Nick, great picks.
[37:49.140 --> 37:49.840]  Yeah, great picks.
[37:51.120 --> 37:52.720]  Here's my final pick.
[37:53.320 --> 37:54.340]  Pick number four.
[37:54.340 --> 37:56.600]  I don't know how many people are going to know this.
[37:57.040 --> 37:57.300]  Great pick.
[38:00.360 --> 38:00.860]  But...
[38:00.860 --> 38:02.300]  This room is...
[38:02.300 --> 38:04.120]  I had this one lined up too.
[38:04.460 --> 38:06.600]  Oh yeah. So good.
[38:11.920 --> 38:14.540]  I had this. It was this fun.
[38:14.960 --> 38:15.480]  Was it really?
[38:15.740 --> 38:17.640]  Yes. It was this fun.
[38:18.160 --> 38:18.840]  Should we play it?
[38:19.180 --> 38:20.340]  Oh my god. Yeah.
[38:22.060 --> 38:24.520]  You use a little gun to shoot...
[38:26.120 --> 38:27.400]  Is that kid dead?
[38:27.400 --> 38:29.240]  So you shoot little marbles?
[38:29.560 --> 38:34.080]  So you shoot little marbles out of the little gun.
[38:34.720 --> 38:37.560]  And you are trying to knock these things
[38:37.560 --> 38:39.360]  that are essentially like little ball bearings
[38:39.360 --> 38:42.180]  inside of like stars or triangles or whatever.
[38:42.520 --> 38:44.460]  You're trying to hit them to go into
[38:44.460 --> 38:47.020]  the opponent's little ditch in front of them.
[38:47.020 --> 38:51.020]  So there's like four or five things on the playfield at once.
[38:51.280 --> 38:53.380]  And you're just picking one, shooting at it,
[38:53.400 --> 38:54.340]  and they have to defend.
[38:54.460 --> 38:55.500]  It's going back and forth.
[38:55.620 --> 38:56.480]  It's really fun.
[38:57.300 --> 38:58.180]  Crossfire ruled.
[38:58.280 --> 38:59.420]  And are you trying to avoid
[38:59.420 --> 39:02.180]  or are you trying to get caught up in the crossfire?
[39:02.280 --> 39:03.360]  Oh, you're definitely getting...
[39:03.360 --> 39:05.260]  Whether you want to or not,
[39:05.320 --> 39:06.740]  you're getting caught up in the crossfire.
[39:07.960 --> 39:10.020]  Like, regardless of what you want,
[39:10.100 --> 39:11.680]  you are getting caught up in the crossfire.
[39:12.080 --> 39:13.920]  Man, America did toy adverts right.
[39:14.400 --> 39:14.820]  Oh yeah.
[39:14.820 --> 39:15.040]  Yeah.
[39:15.040 --> 39:16.660]  Tricking kids outright?
[39:16.920 --> 39:17.400]  100%.
[39:17.400 --> 39:18.280]  We did that so well.
[39:18.960 --> 39:19.800]  We should...
[39:19.800 --> 39:22.360]  We do the same thing with medication commercials now.
[39:22.760 --> 39:25.120]  Do you have mesothelioma?
[39:25.600 --> 39:28.720]  We should definitely do a crossfire tournament.
[39:30.100 --> 39:31.300]  Dude, that'd be sick.
[39:31.400 --> 39:31.780]  Hell yeah.
[39:32.000 --> 39:33.220]  See who the best one is.
[39:33.420 --> 39:34.180]  That'd be fucking awesome.
[39:34.340 --> 39:35.420]  Summer of 98 content.
[39:35.740 --> 39:36.580]  Dude, no kidding.
[39:36.740 --> 39:40.400]  I think crossfire might be a little bit earlier than that,
[39:40.520 --> 39:41.720]  but okay, why not?
[39:42.420 --> 39:42.900]  Why not?
[39:43.980 --> 39:45.040]  Crossfire's still around.
[39:45.200 --> 39:46.180]  Well, you can buy crossfire.
[39:47.380 --> 39:47.840]  $70!
[39:49.560 --> 39:52.080]  And is that new crossfire or just old stock?
[39:52.540 --> 39:55.340]  I mean, it looks almost exactly like that crossfire.
[39:55.520 --> 39:57.160]  It does not look...
[39:57.160 --> 39:58.060]  70 bucks.
[39:58.140 --> 40:00.960]  That's what fantasy star on the Sega Master System cost when it came out.
[40:03.240 --> 40:07.020]  What a great associating price to fantasy star.
[40:07.180 --> 40:07.740]  Like, every pro...
[40:07.740 --> 40:10.440]  That's two fantasy stars on the Sega Master System game.
[40:10.480 --> 40:11.640]  That's what I always used to think of.
[40:11.640 --> 40:15.400]  I was like, how can a video game cost $70 in 1985?
[40:17.880 --> 40:18.600]  Okay, cool.
[40:18.800 --> 40:21.160]  And Gavin, your last pick.
[40:21.740 --> 40:22.080]  Oh, okay.
[40:23.240 --> 40:26.060]  What was the tagline for Dr. Pepper?
[40:27.440 --> 40:28.020]  Be a pepper?
[40:28.680 --> 40:29.920]  Yeah, I guess that was it.
[40:31.320 --> 40:32.000]  Yeah, I don't...
[40:32.000 --> 40:32.520]  It was weird.
[40:32.780 --> 40:34.540]  Wouldn't you like to be a pepper too?
[40:34.800 --> 40:35.000]  Yeah.
[40:35.360 --> 40:36.600]  He's a pepper, she's a pepper.
[40:36.780 --> 40:38.280]  Oh, yeah, that was...
[40:38.280 --> 40:38.980]  I guess that was it.
[40:39.440 --> 40:41.940]  I've made a lot of references to Dr. Pepper commercials,
[40:42.180 --> 40:45.540]  and I realized the catchphrase was completely different in the UK,
[40:45.720 --> 40:48.120]  where it was, what's the worst that can happen?
[40:48.820 --> 40:49.020]  What?
[40:49.540 --> 40:54.240]  And the reason I thought it was American is because all of the commercials
[40:54.760 --> 40:57.260]  star American actors and seem to be shot in America,
[40:57.500 --> 40:59.640]  but entirely for a UK audience.
[40:59.860 --> 41:01.180]  They even look like fuzzy...
[41:01.180 --> 41:01.320]  Is that Jesse Eisenberg?
[41:01.440 --> 41:03.300]  That's a teenage Jesse Eisenberg.
[41:03.580 --> 41:03.820]  What?
[41:04.040 --> 41:04.720]  Okay, hang on.
[41:04.860 --> 41:05.680]  All right, hang on.
[41:06.660 --> 41:08.200]  Soda, soda, soda.
[41:08.200 --> 41:08.980]  Oh, yeah, that's him.
[41:09.120 --> 41:09.360]  Soda.
[41:11.000 --> 41:11.560]  Young Zuck.
[41:11.920 --> 41:14.120]  Dr. Pepper, what's the worst that could happen?
[41:14.720 --> 41:15.620]  What does that mean?
[41:21.580 --> 41:22.300]  What are we going to do here?
[41:22.320 --> 41:23.480]  We're going to have to cut him out of his pants.
[41:23.820 --> 41:25.920]  Don't worry, kid, we'll just get these out of here and we'll be all right.
[41:26.380 --> 41:26.400]  All right.
[41:26.580 --> 41:27.680]  What do you want to do?
[41:27.700 --> 41:27.880]  What do you want to do?
[41:27.880 --> 41:29.300]  The underwear's going to have to come off.
[41:29.300 --> 41:30.200]  All right, take the underwear off.
[41:30.220 --> 41:31.700]  Take the underwear off.
[41:32.520 --> 41:33.380]  Sorry about that.
[41:34.680 --> 41:35.100]  That's it.
[41:35.560 --> 41:36.120]  Step aside.
[41:36.240 --> 41:37.540]  Butt naked kid coming through.
[41:39.000 --> 41:40.900]  What is going on?
[41:45.100 --> 41:50.800]  So the end of every advert has something go horrifically wrong and then it says, Dr. Pepper, what's the worst that could happen?
[41:51.120 --> 41:55.820]  But no one in America knows that tagline or has seen any of these commercials.
[41:56.160 --> 41:57.380]  I don't understand.
[41:57.680 --> 41:58.920]  What were they doing?
[41:59.400 --> 42:01.540]  I want a Dr. Pepper or...
[42:02.700 --> 42:03.600]  Yeah, I don't know.
[42:03.720 --> 42:04.640]  I don't understand why.
[42:04.860 --> 42:08.060]  Like, he gets the Dr. Pepper and then it goes wrong.
[42:08.360 --> 42:11.120]  I assume it's because people in England didn't really know what it tasted like.
[42:11.340 --> 42:13.020]  And so they were just like, oh, what's the worst that could happen?
[42:13.120 --> 42:14.560]  And then they show something horrific happening.
[42:14.960 --> 42:24.720]  But in every piece of content I've been in for the last 10 years, anytime someone has mentioned Dr. Pepper, I've just asked, what's the worst that can happen?
[42:24.780 --> 42:27.000]  And no one ever knows what I'm talking about.
[42:27.000 --> 42:30.960]  I might have done it on F*** Face like two or three times.
[42:32.940 --> 42:35.340]  I've never heard of this.
[42:35.420 --> 42:36.440]  I've never seen this.
[42:36.640 --> 42:38.160]  I don't understand it.
[42:38.180 --> 42:38.960]  I'm so confused.
[42:40.060 --> 42:40.700]  Yeah, I don't either.
[42:41.480 --> 42:45.980]  And I think also in the middle of that is that woman from, I don't remember her name, but she's in Mission Impossible movies.
[42:46.320 --> 42:47.220]  That was her.
[42:47.440 --> 42:48.200]  I thought so.
[42:48.840 --> 42:51.120]  She's like Tom Cruise's wife in Mission Impossible.
[42:52.520 --> 42:53.200]  That lady.
[42:54.600 --> 42:55.400]  Michelle Monaghan?
[42:55.860 --> 42:56.620]  Yeah, that was her.
[42:56.620 --> 42:57.980]  Yeah, that's her name.
[42:59.700 --> 43:00.100]  Crazy.
[43:00.700 --> 43:05.040]  Well, that was a great last pick, Gavin. That really threw me for a loop.
[43:05.240 --> 43:10.680]  And that's an actual frame of Jesse Eisenberg's bare ass on a TV commercial.
[43:11.320 --> 43:12.460]  I'll be beating you up for that later.
[43:15.820 --> 43:19.060]  Here is Geoff's final pick. Geoff, anything you want to say about this?
[43:19.720 --> 43:20.900]  I'm going to throw this out there.
[43:21.200 --> 43:22.760]  This final pick is an audible.
[43:24.420 --> 43:27.660]  Honestly, I had something else picked that I was really happy with.
[43:28.100 --> 43:32.020]  But Nick's Taco Bell commercial jogged a very important memory.
[43:32.600 --> 43:33.620]  And so I went and I grabbed it.
[43:33.680 --> 43:35.640]  So what I'm saying is I haven't watched this yet.
[43:35.760 --> 43:36.900]  I think it's the right commercial.
[43:37.200 --> 43:39.320]  So I apologize if it goes wrong.
[43:39.540 --> 43:40.420]  Okay, here it is.
[43:41.080 --> 43:41.520]  Spuds.
[43:41.840 --> 43:42.900]  There he is.
[43:43.120 --> 43:44.940]  What a happening dude.
[43:46.900 --> 43:48.820]  I suppose Mackenzie's a rad dude.
[43:52.140 --> 43:52.740]  Awesome.
[44:03.580 --> 44:04.180]  Every...
[44:04.180 --> 44:05.740]  Look at him go.
[44:10.120 --> 44:14.040]  I had a bull terrier for 11 years because of those commercials.
[44:14.240 --> 44:14.780]  Hell yeah.
[44:16.060 --> 44:17.160]  Go Spuds, go.
[44:17.620 --> 44:18.680]  I also think it's really weird.
[44:18.780 --> 44:21.520]  That commercial is clearly marketed towards kids.
[44:21.880 --> 44:23.620]  Because that dog is the original party animal.
[44:24.000 --> 44:25.180]  And that was the country version.
[44:25.300 --> 44:26.160]  There was a lot of beach.
[44:26.540 --> 44:30.580]  There was a lot of Hawaiian shirt wearing Spuds Mackenzie commercials.
[44:30.960 --> 44:32.560]  Clearly marketed towards kids.
[44:32.600 --> 44:33.900]  That is a beer commercial.
[44:35.020 --> 44:37.120]  It never struck me as odd when I was a child.
[44:37.220 --> 44:39.140]  But I really wanted to be Spuds Mackenzie when I was a kid.
[44:39.200 --> 44:42.680]  Every time I see a dog like that, I just go Spuds Mackenzie.
[44:42.820 --> 44:43.340]  Out loud.
[44:43.340 --> 44:44.240]  Every time.
[44:45.460 --> 44:46.100]  100% of the time.
[44:46.160 --> 44:49.340]  Was that a random Australian guy announcing that it was Spuds Mackenzie?
[44:50.020 --> 44:50.620]  Was it?
[44:50.860 --> 44:51.600]  I don't know.
[44:52.360 --> 44:53.040]  Was he Australian?
[44:53.420 --> 44:54.580]  I don't know, I just...
[44:55.340 --> 44:56.560]  It was much later than this.
[44:58.460 --> 45:00.480]  Hang on, I need to see if he's Australian, Geoff. Hang on.
[45:00.720 --> 45:01.400]  Well, no worries.
[45:10.360 --> 45:12.160]  Oh, it's supposed to be Robin Leach.
[45:12.160 --> 45:13.400]  No, it's Robin Leach.
[45:13.660 --> 45:14.960]  I don't know if it is Robin Leach.
[45:14.960 --> 45:16.720]  It is Robin Leach.
[45:17.180 --> 45:19.120]  Do you think... Is Robin Leach Australian?
[45:19.120 --> 45:20.380]  Who's Robin Leach?
[45:20.800 --> 45:21.920]  Yeah, I don't know who Robin Leach is.
[45:21.940 --> 45:22.080]  Wow, really?
[45:22.340 --> 45:23.500]  You don't know who Robin Leach is?
[45:24.380 --> 45:25.960]  Lifestyles of the Rich and the Famous.
[45:26.040 --> 45:26.860]  You don't know who Robin Leach is?
[45:27.800 --> 45:28.200]  No.
[45:28.900 --> 45:32.340]  We had a show in America called Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,
[45:32.780 --> 45:38.180]  where Robin Leach would take you around and show how rich people lived.
[45:38.220 --> 45:39.500]  It was like Cribs before Cribs.
[45:39.800 --> 45:40.000]  Yep.
[45:40.160 --> 45:40.900]  Oh, okay.
[45:41.240 --> 45:42.780]  And he's a British guy, right?
[45:43.180 --> 45:43.960]  Yeah, he was British.
[45:44.140 --> 45:44.880]  There he is, Robin Leach.
[45:45.300 --> 45:45.700]  Wow.
[45:46.520 --> 45:47.580]  Also famous in America.
[45:48.920 --> 45:52.400]  He's from Perryvale, United Kingdom.
[45:52.880 --> 45:53.380]  Yeah.
[45:53.800 --> 45:55.100]  Died in Las Vegas.
[45:56.180 --> 45:57.820]  He seems like a Vegas kind of guy.
[45:58.020 --> 45:59.020]  Yeah, absolutely.
[45:59.240 --> 46:00.020]  Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[46:00.960 --> 46:04.160]  Okay, and that's Geoff's last pick.
[46:04.480 --> 46:07.120]  Now we have the final pick of this draft.
[46:07.700 --> 46:08.820]  Andrew, number four.
[46:08.940 --> 46:10.020]  A lot of pressure here.
[46:10.120 --> 46:11.900]  There's a lot I could have went with.
[46:11.900 --> 46:17.580]  I used to get tons of PSA type commercials as a kid growing up.
[46:17.700 --> 46:23.120]  There's so many that they'd play constantly on our equivalent of Nickelodeon and whatnot.
[46:23.320 --> 46:25.760]  So I'm going to go with what I think is the most iconic.
[46:26.060 --> 46:28.720]  It's one of the things I immediately think of when I think of childhood commercials.
[46:28.980 --> 46:36.220]  And I think it just is sort of a perfect ending to this draft as a whole for what the messaging is of the commercial.
[46:36.900 --> 46:37.200]  Okay.
[46:37.220 --> 46:41.340]  Anybody from my time, from my age, has seen this so many times.
[46:41.340 --> 46:41.940]  Okay.
[46:43.440 --> 46:46.260]  It's nighttime in a kitchen just like yours.
[46:46.500 --> 46:47.720]  All is quiet.
[46:48.860 --> 46:49.720]  Or is it?
[46:50.660 --> 46:51.280]  Oh, shit.
[46:51.540 --> 46:56.440]  North American house hippo is found throughout Canada and the eastern United States.
[46:57.280 --> 47:00.720]  House hippos are very timid creatures and are rarely seen.
[47:01.400 --> 47:03.960]  But they will defend their territory if provoked.
[47:04.720 --> 47:09.120]  They come out at night to search for food, water, and materials for their nests.
[47:09.120 --> 47:15.620]  The favorite foods of the house hippo are chips, raisins, and the crumbs from peanut butter on toast.
[47:16.240 --> 47:22.200]  They build their nests in bedroom closets using lost mittens, dryer lint, and bits of string.
[47:22.880 --> 47:25.000]  The nests have to be very soft and warm.
[47:25.520 --> 47:28.480]  House hippos sleep about 16 hours a day.
[47:29.740 --> 47:31.320]  That looked really... real.
[47:31.620 --> 47:33.540]  But you knew it couldn't be true, didn't you?
[47:33.600 --> 47:33.940]  You knew.
[47:34.040 --> 47:37.360]  That's why it's good to think about what you're watching on TV and ask questions.
[47:37.360 --> 47:39.460]  Kind of like you just did.
[47:39.560 --> 47:41.610]  A message from Concerned Children's Advertisers.
[47:42.980 --> 47:43.960]  Hey, idiot!
[47:44.120 --> 47:45.100]  What the hell was that?
[47:45.720 --> 47:47.600]  That buzzkill fucking...
[47:47.600 --> 47:50.020]  That baby flying through the air?
[47:50.220 --> 47:51.360]  That wasn't real.
[47:51.600 --> 47:52.280]  That didn't happen.
[47:52.400 --> 47:54.060]  You know that chihuahua running up?
[47:54.380 --> 47:55.280]  Get that Taco Bell?
[47:55.540 --> 47:56.600]  That's some bullshit.
[47:57.000 --> 47:57.840]  Spuds McKenzie?
[47:58.080 --> 47:59.440]  Can't really play the drums.
[47:59.760 --> 48:01.800]  You can't steal the cow in a train station.
[48:02.660 --> 48:03.540]  No. Yeah.
[48:05.160 --> 48:07.760]  I'm just sort of floored. Like, it was so long.
[48:08.320 --> 48:10.700]  And then it was like, guess what? That's not even real.
[48:10.900 --> 48:12.000]  And I'm like, none of this is right.
[48:12.360 --> 48:16.020]  Guess what? We fucking lied to you and you believed it, you idiot.
[48:16.340 --> 48:19.440]  But all you're going to take away from that is, man, I wish little house hippos were real.
[48:19.500 --> 48:20.680]  I'm just going to think about the house hippos.
[48:21.460 --> 48:23.180]  Where do I buy the house hippo? I want one.
[48:23.440 --> 48:24.180]  Can we make one?
[48:25.760 --> 48:30.240]  My thought while watching it is, I wish I could get the opinion of a house hippo for the chip-off.
[48:30.240 --> 48:33.980]  I feel like there's clearly expertise in that realm.
[48:35.440 --> 48:36.320]  Weird's our draft.
[48:37.140 --> 48:39.040]  That is such a weird commercial.
[48:39.500 --> 48:40.640]  Well, that's our draft.
[48:41.200 --> 48:42.800]  How do you guys feel like you did?
[48:43.400 --> 48:44.060]  I feel good.
[48:44.180 --> 48:44.980]  I feel good.
[48:45.340 --> 48:45.860]  I feel good.
[48:46.020 --> 48:47.420]  Part of my childhood.
[48:48.080 --> 48:52.460]  I feel like Andrew did really well with those mattress ones.
[48:52.680 --> 48:55.860]  Oh, those Dodds commercials were great, dude. Those were really fun.
[48:56.220 --> 48:57.720]  I didn't really have a lot of local stuff.
[48:57.720 --> 49:00.400]  My country is small enough to just be local.
[49:00.580 --> 49:01.800]  Yeah, I get it.
[49:04.040 --> 49:08.440]  Does anybody have any runner-ups they want to show?
[49:09.320 --> 49:11.020]  I've got an honorable mention, for sure.
[49:12.340 --> 49:16.220]  Okay, do you want to throw it in the line below your last one?
[49:16.400 --> 49:18.600]  And we'll show an honorable mention.
[49:19.260 --> 49:20.340]  Can I get one honorable mention?
[49:20.480 --> 49:21.220]  Yeah, sure, why not?
[49:21.860 --> 49:23.560]  Okay, I had a few. This one will do.
[49:24.140 --> 49:25.360]  This is Gavin's.
[49:25.760 --> 49:27.020]  This is Tango.
[49:28.640 --> 49:30.160]  Tagline being, you've been tangoed.
[49:30.680 --> 49:31.240]  Okay.
[49:31.380 --> 49:40.960]  This advert started a trend that caused so many kids on so many playgrounds to end up with a burst eardrum.
[49:41.460 --> 49:42.020]  Really?
[49:42.480 --> 49:46.200]  Yeah, and it was eventually, I think, also banned.
[49:46.900 --> 49:48.760]  But I might be wrong, I don't know.
[49:57.440 --> 50:02.740]  Oh, yes, we could be in for a quintessential tango sensation here!
[50:02.780 --> 50:03.720]  What is happening?
[50:04.640 --> 50:06.340]  Wham! He's been tangoed!
[50:08.480 --> 50:10.840]  Yes, Ralph, the big orange fellow running from the left.
[50:11.180 --> 50:12.580]  And he gives him a good old slapping.
[50:12.880 --> 50:15.700]  It just illustrates his great unbuzz.
[50:18.300 --> 50:20.040]  Yes, Ralph, super taste sensation.
[50:20.040 --> 50:21.320]  Did you get tangoed a lot, Gavin?
[50:21.700 --> 50:23.220]  I got tangoed a few times, yeah.
[50:23.900 --> 50:26.160]  And as it says, you know when you've been tangoed.
[50:26.920 --> 50:31.240]  What is it with your country and punishing you for buying their beverages?
[50:31.740 --> 50:33.680]  Why do they hate you when you buy your beverage?
[50:34.080 --> 50:36.140]  Get a Dr. Pepper, end up in fucking jail.
[50:36.300 --> 50:37.120]  End up dead.
[50:37.400 --> 50:37.820]  Need a saw.
[50:38.060 --> 50:39.180]  Buy a tango, get punched.
[50:39.440 --> 50:40.160]  Because that's the thing.
[50:40.300 --> 50:40.820]  Get slapped.
[50:41.680 --> 50:42.400]  It's crazy.
[50:44.960 --> 50:47.320]  So that caused kids all over England to do that.
[50:47.620 --> 50:50.640]  Well, yeah, because they were just slapping each other in the face with both hands at the same time.
[50:50.820 --> 50:52.580]  And hitting each other in the ear holes.
[50:53.480 --> 50:55.340]  And it was a big problem at the time, I think.
[50:55.340 --> 50:56.140]  Seems like it would be.
[50:56.680 --> 50:59.740]  Let's go with Geoff's honorable mention here.
[50:59.920 --> 51:00.780]  Geoff, anything you want to say?
[51:01.440 --> 51:03.940]  This was my original fourth pick before I switched it out.
[51:04.160 --> 51:04.840]  Very similar.
[51:05.640 --> 51:07.500]  Just like super popular in America.
[51:08.080 --> 51:09.280]  There was a million of these.
[51:09.440 --> 51:11.020]  This is just the one that...
[51:11.020 --> 51:13.380]  I didn't realize how bad all the songs were.
[51:13.800 --> 51:14.920]  They're pretty fucking bad.
[51:15.360 --> 51:16.080]  But, yeah.
[51:16.720 --> 51:17.420]  Okay, here it is.
[51:23.480 --> 51:24.840]  Goddamn right it is.
[51:28.980 --> 51:30.780]  Oh my god.
[51:31.180 --> 51:31.680]  Jesus.
[51:33.060 --> 51:34.860]  This is great.
[51:35.760 --> 51:37.100]  This is a really good one.
[51:37.720 --> 51:38.960]  That guy must have been terrified.
[51:46.500 --> 51:47.400]  Damn right it is.
[51:47.400 --> 51:49.120]  Oh yeah.
[51:50.600 --> 51:53.140]  There were like a million of those, obviously.
[51:53.500 --> 51:54.980]  I'm sure they made their way to England, too.
[51:55.460 --> 51:56.240]  Those were always great.
[51:56.420 --> 51:58.120]  This is like Bert Kreischer's favorite drink, man.
[51:58.160 --> 51:58.540]  That's great.
[52:00.520 --> 52:02.980]  I also had... there's no need to play it.
[52:03.080 --> 52:05.760]  My other one was going to be California Raisins.
[52:05.980 --> 52:06.900]  Oh, that's good, too.
[52:09.060 --> 52:10.880]  Let's go with Nick's.
[52:11.000 --> 52:12.400]  We'll go with mine and wrap up with Andrew's.
[52:13.060 --> 52:14.040]  Oh, Nick.
[52:14.280 --> 52:15.320]  Very good pick.
[52:15.320 --> 52:18.300]  Yeah, this one traumatized a lot of kids, I'm guessing.
[52:18.300 --> 52:18.560]  Yep.
[52:20.040 --> 52:20.480]  Oh.
[52:21.960 --> 52:22.940]  Also, those beds.
[52:32.260 --> 52:33.560]  I've never seen this.
[52:34.500 --> 52:35.860]  Dude, you gotta not wake daddy, bro.
[52:36.520 --> 52:39.080]  Dude, waking daddy was the worst when you were a kid.
[52:39.300 --> 52:40.400]  Don't fucking wake daddy.
[52:40.800 --> 52:41.680]  I got work!
[52:47.580 --> 52:49.680]  They just keep saying it.
[52:50.880 --> 52:52.020]  That's the whole commercial.
[52:52.160 --> 52:52.640]  There's a lot of daddy.
[52:52.640 --> 52:53.660]  So what wakes daddy?
[52:53.820 --> 52:55.040]  Pressing on the alarm?
[52:55.120 --> 53:03.480]  So you have, like, you land on spots, and then you press the alarm, and it's a random number that you press it a certain amount of times or whatever, and then he fucking sits up and his hat shoots off.
[53:03.940 --> 53:04.420]  That's it.
[53:06.480 --> 53:07.900]  And then you're not supposed to wake daddy.
[53:08.180 --> 53:09.500]  And then the sleepover's over.
[53:09.500 --> 53:10.060]  Yeah.
[53:10.240 --> 53:10.500]  Yeah.
[53:10.740 --> 53:11.820]  Go home!
[53:12.540 --> 53:13.620]  He doesn't even call the other parents.
[53:13.720 --> 53:14.300]  He just sends them out.
[53:14.360 --> 53:14.700]  Hell no.
[53:15.060 --> 53:16.300]  Yeah, you just walk home.
[53:18.340 --> 53:22.640]  Geoff mentioned it earlier, but this was on my shortlist.
[53:23.000 --> 53:23.620]  Oh, yeah.
[53:23.640 --> 53:27.140]  Now your child can visit steamy jungles, grassy plains...
[53:27.140 --> 53:29.460]  Absolutely wanted these so much.
[53:29.460 --> 53:35.880]  ...and learn surprising facts about the magnificent animals that live there, all through the captivating, colorful pages of Zoo Books.
[53:36.140 --> 53:37.240]  The publication is...
[53:37.240 --> 53:37.980]  There's a monkey!
[53:37.980 --> 53:38.640]  ...for young readers.
[53:38.960 --> 53:44.820]  Each monthly issue of Zoo Books is packed with breathtaking full-color photos and scientifically accurate illustrations.
[53:45.300 --> 53:45.520]  Great.
[53:45.760 --> 53:46.640]  Well, accurate to the time.
[53:46.880 --> 53:47.160]  Yeah.
[53:47.800 --> 53:49.560]  They just keep hanging out with the monkey.
[53:49.820 --> 53:52.320]  ...and 12 fascinating issues of Zoo Books for the special price of $25.
[53:52.320 --> 53:53.400]  This one's on camels.
[53:54.600 --> 53:58.180]  I like that you know that there was a discussion about...
[53:58.180 --> 53:59.000]  Oh, nice.
[53:59.100 --> 54:02.480]  ...plus you also get the colorful collection of animal stickers and the tiger poster.
[54:03.140 --> 54:04.640]  Tiger poster's so sick.
[54:04.660 --> 54:07.060]  ...and send learning and fun to a child you love.
[54:08.140 --> 54:12.900]  The thing I remember a lot about that was him having the conversation with the mailman.
[54:13.480 --> 54:16.720]  Like, the mailman is so excited to give him the Zoo Books.
[54:17.180 --> 54:18.600]  Like, he's thrilled. Like, watch.
[54:19.140 --> 54:21.680]  He's like, I read half of it on the way over here. It's fucking awesome.
[54:21.680 --> 54:24.120]  Oh, you're not gonna believe what happens in this one.
[54:24.400 --> 54:26.700]  Page 17. Praying mantises.
[54:27.760 --> 54:35.360]  Oh, man. But Zoo Books was definitely one that I saw a lot in tandem with the Sears air conditioning commercial.
[54:36.180 --> 54:39.400]  I'm not sure if a camel can carry an entire Zoo Book, though.
[54:39.420 --> 54:41.980]  I agree. I agree with you. 100%.
[54:43.980 --> 54:46.760]  Andrew, your honorable mention. Anything you want to say about it?
[54:47.000 --> 54:52.700]  Yes. It is another PSA type ad. This was the one that I thought of more as a kid.
[54:52.820 --> 54:55.400]  I preferred this one over the hippos. It wasn't as iconic.
[54:55.780 --> 54:59.380]  There are some kids in here that I thought were fucking cool as a little kid.
[55:00.120 --> 55:00.520]  Alright.
[55:00.920 --> 55:02.920]  That are not cool at all, but here we go.
[55:07.940 --> 55:10.820]  Oh, this is a thing that it looks like you would love.
[55:11.360 --> 55:12.880]  This kid was so cool.
[55:13.520 --> 55:14.140]  Oh, wow.
[55:16.100 --> 55:16.620]  Bugs.
[55:20.540 --> 55:22.660]  It's like every cool thing ever.
[55:23.080 --> 55:24.480]  This kid was so cool.
[55:35.680 --> 55:37.000]  This is a great commercial.
[55:40.260 --> 55:45.240]  This is a really 90s feeling commercial, which means it came out in 2005 in Canada.
[55:50.420 --> 55:52.900]  This feels like a 1999 thing.
[55:53.360 --> 55:54.680]  So, man.
[55:54.880 --> 55:56.260]  Dude, what a fun commercial, though.
[56:02.060 --> 56:02.960]  What's your thing?
[56:04.300 --> 56:05.520]  Andrew, what's your thing?
[56:06.940 --> 56:09.240]  I wish my thing was T-Rex noises.
[56:09.660 --> 56:11.760]  I'd give a lot to be a T-Rex noise guy.
[56:12.360 --> 56:16.040]  I would say my thing, unfortunately, is bad ankles and a lot of pillows.
[56:16.300 --> 56:19.620]  I think I'm fucked up on what my thing should be.
[56:20.460 --> 56:22.880]  Man, they really cared about advertising to children in Canada.
[56:23.680 --> 56:24.360]  Yeah, they seem to.
[56:25.040 --> 56:26.720]  They really wanted to protect them.
[56:27.100 --> 56:27.720]  Oh, there's so many.
[56:28.280 --> 56:30.140]  Andrew, can I ask you a question, Andrew?
[56:30.420 --> 56:30.920]  Of course.
[56:31.220 --> 56:32.200]  Do you feel protected?
[56:36.060 --> 56:37.560]  I feel pretty protected, yeah.
[56:37.740 --> 56:39.240]  Mainly because of my unbreakable nose.
[56:39.360 --> 56:41.360]  I think that may have carried me quite a bit in life.
[56:41.680 --> 56:44.080]  But, I mean, do you feel like Canada was looking out for you?
[56:44.420 --> 56:45.980]  And they protected you through your childhood?
[56:46.700 --> 56:47.480]  Yeah, I guess.
[56:47.620 --> 56:50.380]  Yeah, I didn't feel they were against me, at the very least.
[56:51.100 --> 56:57.520]  I mean, the idea of having an ad that makes you question the realism of the ad, that's mind-blowing to me.
[56:57.600 --> 56:58.800]  I never had anything like that.
[56:59.620 --> 56:59.860]  Yeah.
[57:00.360 --> 57:04.960]  Do you think all the little Canadian kids in Vancouver with boot prints on their chests feel protected?
[57:07.320 --> 57:07.720]  Well...
[57:07.720 --> 57:08.240]  They don't.
[57:08.360 --> 57:08.580]  Yeah.
[57:09.500 --> 57:10.820]  Thankfully, there aren't many of us.
[57:11.140 --> 57:11.500]  That's true.
[57:11.880 --> 57:13.100]  Alleged. Beyond one.
[57:14.320 --> 57:14.720]  Alleged.
[57:17.840 --> 57:19.200]  Well, there you have it.
[57:19.300 --> 57:21.420]  Those are TV commercials, and we watched them.
[57:21.760 --> 57:22.660]  Why are... hang on.
[57:22.800 --> 57:23.600]  Are you doing the outro?
[57:24.240 --> 57:25.060]  No, I was just saying.
[57:25.320 --> 57:25.900]  Maybe. I don't know.
[57:26.320 --> 57:29.600]  I just... I thought Gavin did such a good intro, I want Gavin to do the outro.
[57:30.220 --> 57:34.560]  Gavin, take it away. I gave you a sample outro. You can use that one, or make your own.
[57:36.120 --> 57:37.520]  Where did you leave... where did you stop?
[57:38.220 --> 57:41.420]  I said, yeah, well, there you have it. We made some commercial... we watched some commercials.
[57:44.040 --> 57:44.360]  Thanks...
[57:45.100 --> 57:46.200]  Thanks for watching The Draft.
[57:47.840 --> 57:49.780]  Hopefully you watched it, and you didn't just listen to it.
[57:52.600 --> 57:54.660]  See you next one.
[57:54.660 --> 57:55.720]  You're so bad.
[58:00.700 --> 58:02.080]  Well, help me out. Do it properly.
[58:02.580 --> 58:02.800]  No!
[58:03.260 --> 58:05.940]  We need somebody to make a commercial on how to do an outro.
[58:07.880 --> 58:08.780]  Oh my god.
[58:10.380 --> 58:12.500]  Maybe if Andrew could rap it to you.
[58:12.660 --> 58:14.500]  Oh, maybe you can rap us out, Gavin.
[58:15.420 --> 58:17.440]  Well, I'll let Andrew do that, because he said all the milk practice.
[58:17.440 --> 58:22.520]  No, I'm not... hey, you've rapped before. There are videos of you rapping. I didn't let you lead the stage.
[58:26.850 --> 58:27.650]  Alright, what...
[58:28.230 --> 58:29.350]  Do the outro!
[58:31.270 --> 58:32.490]  What else do I need to say?
[58:33.430 --> 58:38.270]  You need to wrap it up somehow. I don't... do you feel like you left that on a strong ending?
[58:38.770 --> 58:46.090]  Hey, thanks for listening to another Draft from F*** Face. We hope you liked it. We've done a few of these in the past. We'll be doing a few in the future.
[58:46.490 --> 58:51.590]  Well, maybe you could find your favorite commercials from when you were a kid and send them to your friends as an adult.
[58:51.590 --> 58:56.470]  And you can say, hey, do you remember this commercial when you were a kid? And your friend can say, yeah, I also liked it.
[58:56.710 --> 58:59.030]  And then you guys can share a moment. Bye!
