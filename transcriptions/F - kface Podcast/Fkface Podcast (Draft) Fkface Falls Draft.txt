[00:15.670 --> 00:20.270]  Okay, we can catch Gavin up when he is here, but we have to roll on this because we've talked
[00:20.270 --> 00:28.190]  about it. And this was my... Geoff, what you're talking about now is the problem I brought
[00:28.190 --> 00:31.670]  up and everyone assured me was not an issue.
[00:32.470 --> 00:34.250]  I don't understand how Geoff is confused.
[00:34.450 --> 00:39.590]  I thought we were all tasked with getting four fail... four falls, sorry, I keep saying
[00:39.590 --> 00:42.890]  it, four falls that we were going to throw into a pool and then we're all going to draft
[00:42.890 --> 00:43.710]  from the pool, right?
[00:44.210 --> 00:45.850]  No, the pool is all falls.
[00:46.350 --> 00:48.630]  So I can submit as many falls to the pool as I want?
[00:48.970 --> 00:50.010]  Well there's the pool...
[00:50.010 --> 00:51.510]  Where does the pool come from?
[00:51.830 --> 00:53.290]  The pool comes from falls.
[00:54.370 --> 00:55.970]  Anything that's considered a fall.
[00:56.970 --> 00:58.290]  So you have a list...
[00:58.850 --> 00:59.710]  Well, who made the list?
[01:00.710 --> 01:01.190]  You did!
[01:01.510 --> 01:02.290]  How big is your list?
[01:02.290 --> 01:02.790]  You made your own list!
[01:02.890 --> 01:03.550]  How big is your list?
[01:03.610 --> 01:06.190]  I made... I have 12 falls on my list.
[01:06.270 --> 01:07.150]  Okay, thank you!
[01:07.150 --> 01:09.930]  So how many falls did you want each person to have on their list?
[01:10.350 --> 01:13.330]  You would need a maximum of 16 if you wanted to be safe.
[01:14.090 --> 01:18.470]  I don't think my 12 falls are going to get drafted, because there's 16 picks.
[01:18.990 --> 01:19.470]  Eric?
[01:19.750 --> 01:20.170]  Uh-huh?
[01:21.250 --> 01:21.730]  Thoughts?
[01:22.030 --> 01:23.350]  Oh, we already had this conversation!
[01:23.730 --> 01:23.990]  No!
[01:24.350 --> 01:24.670]  Yes!
[01:25.010 --> 01:26.810]  This is... no, this is very clear.
[01:26.950 --> 01:27.190]  Okay.
[01:27.230 --> 01:32.390]  So there's going to be 16 draft picks taken, there will be 16 falls, by the time we finish
[01:32.390 --> 01:32.930]  this recording...
[01:32.930 --> 01:35.330]  And where do those 16 falls come from?
[01:35.850 --> 01:37.790]  Anything that is considered a fall.
[01:38.050 --> 01:38.810]  That is the pool.
[01:39.330 --> 01:45.350]  Geoff, you are asking the question that I asked last week, and everyone kept telling me, it's
[01:45.350 --> 01:45.810]  all falls!
[01:46.070 --> 01:46.670]  It's every fall!
[01:46.850 --> 01:47.750]  It's all falls!
[01:48.030 --> 01:48.890]  I'm with you!
[01:49.410 --> 01:54.090]  This doesn't make sense, unless there are a limited number of things that we... but...
[01:54.090 --> 01:56.510]  I was giving Andrew too much credit.
[01:56.950 --> 01:57.790]  No, you're ridiculous!
[01:58.630 --> 02:00.410]  I don't understand how this is not a pool!
[02:00.830 --> 02:03.170]  I just... I just don't know who's putting the water in the pool, man!
[02:03.190 --> 02:04.910]  This is exactly what I said.
[02:04.910 --> 02:05.230]  It doesn't matter!
[02:05.390 --> 02:05.710]  It's a fall!
[02:06.010 --> 02:06.610]  Exactly what I said.
[02:06.790 --> 02:10.590]  It doesn't matter if I have a responsibility to put... if I have a responsibility to throw
[02:10.590 --> 02:13.690]  a couple of buckets in the water, I need to know how many fucking buckets I need to fill
[02:13.690 --> 02:13.790]  up!
[02:13.790 --> 02:15.670]  So here's what I've come to...
[02:15.670 --> 02:16.330]  You're filling up four buckets.
[02:16.530 --> 02:17.070]  Here's what I've come to...
[02:17.070 --> 02:17.770]  That's what I asked!
[02:17.810 --> 02:19.410]  I need to submit four fucking falls!
[02:19.530 --> 02:20.330]  I have nine!
[02:20.450 --> 02:22.270]  I need help narrowing them down!
[02:22.710 --> 02:24.730]  So here's... here's what I've come to understand.
[02:25.310 --> 02:30.770]  You know how there are a limited number of picks that we are making?
[02:30.970 --> 02:31.230]  Yes.
[02:31.570 --> 02:38.490]  The pool that we are drawing from is a near unlimited pool, so the amount that we will
[02:38.490 --> 02:42.070]  cross over is near zero.
[02:42.450 --> 02:45.570]  So let's say, Geoff, that you have nine, right?
[02:45.890 --> 02:47.710]  And Grape Lady is on your list.
[02:48.050 --> 02:49.250]  Just use that as an example.
[02:49.710 --> 02:49.870]  Okay.
[02:50.050 --> 02:54.210]  It will be removed from your list by somebody taking them ahead of you, if they do.
[02:54.610 --> 02:56.210]  That is the natural process of this.
[02:56.210 --> 02:57.810]  I understand that, but...
[02:57.810 --> 02:59.330]  The draft isn't the confusing part.
[02:59.330 --> 03:00.390]  But the NFL draft isn't like...
[03:00.390 --> 03:04.390]  The NFL draft isn't, okay, we're going to draft from seven and a half billion people
[03:04.390 --> 03:07.290]  if we're going to draft from these 300 college recruits.
[03:07.470 --> 03:09.350]  We had this conversation last week.
[03:09.350 --> 03:13.570]  We had this exact same conversation last week.
[03:13.570 --> 03:14.470]  What are you talking about?
[03:14.930 --> 03:15.810]  And how was it resolved?
[03:16.230 --> 03:17.230]  You kept agreeing with Andrew!
[03:17.230 --> 03:18.490]  It was resolved you going like I'm with Andrew!
[03:18.490 --> 03:21.650]  No, I'm not agreeing with Andrew because I realized I was giving him too much fucking
[03:21.650 --> 03:22.010]  credit!
[03:22.290 --> 03:23.290]  No, it's a pool.
[03:23.410 --> 03:23.810]  I don't understand.
[03:23.810 --> 03:24.310]  This is exactly what I said.
[03:24.330 --> 03:25.370]  Why are we fighting about the pool?
[03:25.670 --> 03:28.750]  I am going along with this because you guys are...
[03:28.750 --> 03:29.410]  Just trust me.
[03:29.410 --> 03:30.630]  Just trust me.
[03:30.630 --> 03:30.830]  Okay.
[03:30.970 --> 03:31.770]  It's going to be fine.
[03:32.110 --> 03:33.310]  So here's the thing.
[03:33.930 --> 03:36.550]  I agree with what you're saying is what I said last week.
[03:36.610 --> 03:37.490]  You're pointing at Geoff.
[03:37.870 --> 03:38.590]  I'm pointing at you, Geoff.
[03:38.650 --> 03:38.870]  Yes, thank you.
[03:38.930 --> 03:43.650]  For the audience who can't see your aggressive point, you're agreeing with me.
[03:43.870 --> 03:45.010]  I'm pointing with all five fingers.
[03:46.990 --> 03:49.790]  This is exactly what I said last week.
[03:49.810 --> 03:50.990]  Let's compare this to the draft.
[03:51.130 --> 03:53.510]  There are players that are eligible that don't get picked.
[03:53.650 --> 03:57.870]  Because remember, I conceded because you could draft a monkey.
[03:57.870 --> 04:01.170]  Or you could draft a made up player in the 1970s.
[04:01.410 --> 04:05.910]  So apparently a near unlimited number of falls is a fine pool to draft from.
[04:06.470 --> 04:10.170]  I feel like, Eric, I need to just...
[04:10.170 --> 04:15.670]  I know you know this as a producer, but we have to acknowledge that at least half the
[04:15.670 --> 04:20.670]  time I'm agreeing with any of you, it is purely for entertainment's sake and I don't agree
[04:20.670 --> 04:20.870]  yet.
[04:21.070 --> 04:22.530]  Or I'm not even sometimes listening.
[04:23.610 --> 04:24.570]  Real entertaining.
[04:25.250 --> 04:26.930]  Some real A quality shit.
[04:28.150 --> 04:31.850]  Gavin is still not here, so we cannot begin our draft that is a pool of near unlimited
[04:31.850 --> 04:32.250]  falls.
[04:33.990 --> 04:35.690]  Yeah, a lot of variety to pick from.
[04:35.770 --> 04:37.630]  I don't know why people all of a sudden hate variety.
[04:37.990 --> 04:39.150]  I view variety as a great thing.
[04:39.750 --> 04:40.930]  I just...
[04:40.930 --> 04:42.110]  I thought we were all...
[04:42.110 --> 04:43.390]  So here's what I did.
[04:43.610 --> 04:44.830]  I came prepared with...
[04:44.830 --> 04:47.290]  I came prepared with like five.
[04:47.370 --> 04:47.870]  I have nine.
[04:48.230 --> 04:48.630]  There you go.
[04:48.750 --> 04:51.510]  So when you're saying we submit these, you don't.
[04:51.570 --> 04:53.610]  You just simply pick from your list of what you want.
[04:53.610 --> 04:54.570]  You draft your pick.
[04:54.850 --> 04:55.850]  So I don't have...
[04:55.850 --> 04:56.810]  So what do you like about it?
[04:57.230 --> 05:01.830]  See now, wouldn't it have been cooler if we all submitted five and then we all picked
[05:01.830 --> 05:03.010]  from that master pool?
[05:04.070 --> 05:04.370]  That's a...
[05:04.370 --> 05:04.570]  That's a...
[05:04.570 --> 05:05.670]  Yeah, that's what I said last week.
[05:05.710 --> 05:06.550]  Like a draft?
[05:06.650 --> 05:06.790]  Yeah.
[05:07.430 --> 05:07.950]  Like how a draft works?
[05:07.950 --> 05:08.530]  No, this is a draft.
[05:08.870 --> 05:10.150]  This is a draft.
[05:10.270 --> 05:11.310]  You fucking idiot.
[05:11.570 --> 05:13.030]  The pool is falls.
[05:13.290 --> 05:14.770]  We pick from the falls.
[05:15.790 --> 05:17.590]  You have to evaluate them.
[05:17.590 --> 05:17.730]  Hey, you shut up.
[05:17.790 --> 05:18.210]  I'm talking to him.
[05:18.230 --> 05:19.170]  That's the entire point.
[05:19.190 --> 05:19.610]  You shut up.
[05:19.650 --> 05:20.110]  I'm talking to him.
[05:21.210 --> 05:23.330]  You're the fucking worst, Geoff.
[05:24.390 --> 05:24.790]  Right.
[05:24.970 --> 05:26.330]  But you never said I was right.
[05:26.570 --> 05:26.670]  Yes, you did.
[05:26.670 --> 05:26.690]  Last week.
[05:26.690 --> 05:28.150]  You said I was wrong last week.
[05:28.250 --> 05:30.550]  I'm clearly agreeing with you right now.
[05:30.770 --> 05:31.890]  That doesn't matter.
[05:32.150 --> 05:33.750]  Hey, Gavin, get on the fucking mic.
[05:34.030 --> 05:34.290]  Okay.
[05:35.210 --> 05:38.030]  Tell this little rat he's right.
[05:38.190 --> 05:38.390]  Okay.
[05:38.610 --> 05:39.090]  Hey, Gavin.
[05:39.490 --> 05:40.750]  About a week ago...
[05:40.750 --> 05:42.470]  You want to grab those headphones too so you can hear Andrew.
[05:42.890 --> 05:46.690]  About a week ago, we had a conversation regarding the Snake Draft, which we'll be starting with.
[05:46.790 --> 05:47.910]  We're already rolling, by the way.
[05:49.250 --> 05:49.890]  It was...
[05:49.890 --> 05:50.630]  Things were too hot.
[05:50.690 --> 05:51.510]  We had to start without you.
[05:51.510 --> 05:51.930]  Oh, okay.
[05:52.030 --> 05:53.310]  It's been a hot morning.
[05:53.430 --> 05:53.570]  Okay.
[05:53.770 --> 05:54.490]  It sounds hot.
[05:54.570 --> 05:56.190]  I can hear the hotness from out in the corridor.
[05:56.450 --> 05:57.270]  Here's what's happened.
[05:58.550 --> 06:03.270]  Do you remember a week ago, we had a conversation where I said, I don't understand the Snake
[06:03.270 --> 06:06.210]  Draft pool because the pool is just all falls.
[06:06.610 --> 06:08.130]  And Andrew said, right, it's all falls.
[06:08.250 --> 06:13.470]  And I said, shouldn't we have a smaller draft list, like a pool that we're picking from?
[06:13.650 --> 06:17.010]  And Andrew said in the 1970s, somebody drafted a hockey player that doesn't exist.
[06:17.110 --> 06:18.270]  You can draft a monkey, that kind of a thing.
[06:18.270 --> 06:20.490]  Do you remember Geoff agreeing with this the whole time?
[06:20.690 --> 06:25.710]  Because what's happened today is he's walked in and he said, I have nine falls to submit.
[06:26.210 --> 06:27.190]  So there's a...
[06:27.190 --> 06:28.010]  No, here's what happened.
[06:28.190 --> 06:33.150]  I said, I came in and I said, all right, should I hit Andrew right now?
[06:33.230 --> 06:34.110]  Oh, he's just not talking.
[06:34.190 --> 06:34.750]  I'm just being quiet right now.
[06:34.750 --> 06:35.270]  I'm not talking.
[06:35.470 --> 06:35.830]  I'm letting you speak.
[06:36.470 --> 06:38.130]  He's too busy fuming to talk.
[06:38.950 --> 06:42.230]  Here's where I made a miscalculation.
[06:42.270 --> 06:44.210]  This is a miscalculation.
[06:44.210 --> 06:50.890]  I understand that globally, like what Andrew was initially saying, I understood, which
[06:50.890 --> 06:54.010]  is that there's an infinite number of falls.
[06:54.290 --> 06:56.670]  All recorded falls in history are a part of the pool.
[06:56.870 --> 07:02.750]  But in my head, I thought that's where we all pick our options from to submit to the
[07:02.750 --> 07:03.550]  communal pool.
[07:03.770 --> 07:08.330]  I just interpolated there being another step that there wasn't, which there by the way
[07:08.330 --> 07:08.970]  should be.
[07:09.170 --> 07:12.250]  No, what would be the point of making a pool to draft from?
[07:12.250 --> 07:13.410]  Why would we?
[07:13.470 --> 07:16.030]  We'd all just take the ones that we put in the pool.
[07:16.490 --> 07:17.430]  What is the point of that?
[07:17.490 --> 07:19.090]  What's the point of the NFL draft?
[07:19.370 --> 07:22.130]  To make, to try to improve your team via selection.
[07:22.290 --> 07:23.650]  Trying to improve your roster.
[07:23.790 --> 07:25.110]  I want to improve my fall roster via selection.
[07:25.110 --> 07:25.130]  You scout.
[07:25.130 --> 07:25.930]  You do your scout.
[07:26.410 --> 07:27.690]  Listen, you do your scouting.
[07:28.070 --> 07:29.270]  That's what the research was.
[07:30.330 --> 07:34.150]  We had the conversation about how we needed to coordinate slightly there, didn't we?
[07:34.170 --> 07:35.610]  Because otherwise we'd all have Grape Lady.
[07:35.870 --> 07:36.970]  I remember that part of the conversation.
[07:37.190 --> 07:39.490]  No, yeah, well, it's fine that we can all have Grape Lady.
[07:39.550 --> 07:41.430]  It'll be like, oh, fuck, you got Grape Lady.
[07:41.430 --> 07:42.370]  That's who I wanted.
[07:43.010 --> 07:43.630]  That's okay.
[07:45.310 --> 07:46.490]  So what have we landed on?
[07:46.650 --> 07:47.210]  What are we doing?
[07:47.210 --> 07:50.450]  I think what we've landed on is everybody picks four falls and we just watch them.
[07:50.930 --> 07:51.330]  Okay.
[07:51.490 --> 07:52.010]  I don't know how to draft anymore.
[07:52.010 --> 07:53.270]  Yeah, I'm good with that.
[07:53.570 --> 07:55.550]  I have links for all of my falls.
[07:55.590 --> 07:57.730]  So we've pre-drafted, is what we're saying.
[07:58.210 --> 08:00.270]  Our personal, we have our draft list.
[08:00.470 --> 08:04.550]  We have what we view as like the top falls, and then we go down and we pick.
[08:04.790 --> 08:09.650]  So once we've watched all of our four videos each, then we pick from that to do what?
[08:09.670 --> 08:10.010]  No.
[08:10.490 --> 08:10.890]  No.
[08:11.550 --> 08:11.950]  No.
[08:12.870 --> 08:13.670]  Jesus Christ.
[08:13.970 --> 08:15.350]  So the way are you looking?
[08:15.430 --> 08:16.550]  Is everyone looking at the spreadsheet?
[08:16.810 --> 08:19.910]  Do you have the spreadsheet up in there for a draft board that Eric made?
[08:20.010 --> 08:20.970]  Do we have a presentation screen?
[08:20.970 --> 08:23.110]  I have the spreadsheet that I've sent to you guys.
[08:23.410 --> 08:25.790]  I can see about getting a screen going.
[08:26.070 --> 08:29.190]  I like that we're doing a thing where we're presenting full videos, but we don't have
[08:29.190 --> 08:30.110]  anything to watch them on.
[08:30.430 --> 08:31.250]  They're setting it up right now.
[08:32.050 --> 08:32.250]  Yeah.
[08:32.530 --> 08:33.610]  We're here for four hours, man.
[08:33.830 --> 08:34.210]  That's true.
[08:34.350 --> 08:37.570]  I guess it's just because you started recording the second you all sat down apparently.
[08:38.010 --> 08:38.810]  We did it.
[08:38.810 --> 08:43.190]  It's just like we sat down and Eric was in a mood and then he was like, roll!
[08:43.670 --> 08:45.450]  I want to hear more about Eric's bad mood.
[08:45.870 --> 08:47.050]  He's just sick of dealing with you.
[08:47.230 --> 08:50.350]  Let me get fucking situated on the thing I didn't know we were doing.
[08:51.150 --> 08:52.590]  I can hear the bad mood.
[08:52.810 --> 08:53.830]  What did you know we were doing?
[08:54.710 --> 08:57.710]  Watching these things that Geoff didn't know we were drafting from.
[08:58.190 --> 09:02.410]  Do you understand how many times it's had to be explained over and over and over and
[09:02.410 --> 09:02.990]  over again?
[09:03.150 --> 09:04.510]  And it's like, well, how come you weren't prepared?
[09:05.130 --> 09:05.850]  For what?
[09:06.710 --> 09:07.430]  For what?
[09:07.530 --> 09:08.790]  Well, you knew we were watching people.
[09:08.790 --> 09:10.610]  No, I didn't.
[09:10.650 --> 09:14.090]  Which is why I created this draft board on my computer because I figured we would all
[09:14.090 --> 09:16.510]  have these things we could submit, watch them individually.
[09:16.810 --> 09:17.090]  On what?
[09:17.470 --> 09:18.110]  Watch them where?
[09:18.250 --> 09:19.090]  On your phones.
[09:19.290 --> 09:19.950]  On your laptop.
[09:20.210 --> 09:20.710]  On anything.
[09:21.170 --> 09:25.750]  But here we are setting up on this thing that I didn't know we were ready for, that I didn't
[09:25.750 --> 09:26.110]  need it.
[09:26.490 --> 09:30.450]  I, uh, I like, I like the direction we're going because I think we can all watch the
[09:30.450 --> 09:30.790]  others.
[09:30.790 --> 09:31.070]  This is good.
[09:31.190 --> 09:31.950]  Is this Geoff's house?
[09:32.310 --> 09:33.470]  Are you kidding me?
[09:33.670 --> 09:35.010]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[09:35.770 --> 09:36.770]  That was a joke.
[09:37.150 --> 09:38.110]  That was a joke.
[09:38.250 --> 09:38.770]  Oh my God.
[09:38.770 --> 09:43.530]  Well, I thought Andrew said that just because he was pretending he was still in Austin.
[09:44.050 --> 09:45.310]  No, it's just being silly.
[09:47.510 --> 09:49.270]  He was never in Austin.
[09:49.710 --> 09:50.370]  You don't know that.
[09:50.670 --> 09:51.310]  I feel like...
[09:51.310 --> 09:54.470]  I'm not even sure that the person who came to Austin in the past who we hung out with
[09:54.470 --> 09:55.970]  is the same dude we're talking to now.
[09:56.190 --> 09:59.950]  Well, whoever we got, we definitely got the same one multiple times.
[10:00.330 --> 10:03.570]  Like if he did send like an avatar to Austin.
[10:03.690 --> 10:03.870]  Right.
[10:04.010 --> 10:06.010]  He sent the same one each time.
[10:06.010 --> 10:09.710]  How surprised would you be to find out Andrew Panton is triplets?
[10:11.170 --> 10:14.730]  And we've been dealing with some variation of three different men.
[10:18.610 --> 10:19.450]  I did.
[10:19.570 --> 10:20.270]  I would love that.
[10:20.510 --> 10:23.310]  It seemed like I went on a run in the podcast when I was in the right.
[10:23.530 --> 10:26.870]  So that would be a clear point of a swap at some stage.
[10:27.350 --> 10:29.290]  People are like, wow, Andrew's right about this.
[10:29.990 --> 10:33.750]  I feel like if he was triplets, he would definitely swap out mid episode.
[10:34.510 --> 10:36.810]  He would definitely have recorded some faces.
[10:37.110 --> 10:37.670]  You're absolutely right.
[10:38.490 --> 10:38.850]  Absolutely.
[10:39.170 --> 10:40.130]  Yeah, for sure.
[10:40.310 --> 10:41.750]  Face falls, snake draft.
[10:43.510 --> 10:45.090]  This is the document you made?
[10:45.450 --> 10:45.650]  Yeah.
[10:45.810 --> 10:46.250]  It looks good.
[10:46.270 --> 10:47.070]  Well, no, I didn't make it.
[10:47.270 --> 10:48.470]  I really like it, Eric.
[10:48.650 --> 10:49.170]  I think it looks good.
[10:49.190 --> 10:49.550]  I just don't.
[10:49.630 --> 10:49.870]  I don't.
[10:49.930 --> 10:50.850]  Like, what else did you want?
[10:51.290 --> 10:52.490]  I still don't know what it is.
[10:53.130 --> 10:53.490]  Okay.
[10:53.710 --> 10:54.450]  So do you see?
[10:54.710 --> 10:55.130]  Do you see?
[10:55.630 --> 10:59.370]  Yeah, but you see the words fall draft, falls draft in the top left.
[10:59.570 --> 10:59.690]  Yeah.
[11:00.070 --> 11:02.390]  That's that means that we're drafting falls.
[11:03.870 --> 11:07.210]  So we take the name Geoff next to the one.
[11:07.610 --> 11:10.270]  That means that Geoff is going to take the first fall.
[11:10.390 --> 11:11.930]  But what happens after we've all...
[11:11.930 --> 11:15.570]  So we're gonna end up with like, what, 20 different videos?
[11:16.010 --> 11:18.150]  No, we're gonna end up with a team of four falls each.
[11:18.250 --> 11:18.750]  That's 20.
[11:19.090 --> 11:19.950]  16 falls will be...
[11:19.950 --> 11:21.830]  Nick is on here.
[11:22.110 --> 11:24.290]  I put the question mark because I wasn't sure if Nick was on here.
[11:24.550 --> 11:27.970]  I'm sorry that Andrew doesn't consider you to be a contemporary or an equal in this.
[11:28.110 --> 11:28.490]  I do.
[11:28.710 --> 11:29.110]  Thank you.
[11:29.310 --> 11:29.790]  And then what?
[11:29.930 --> 11:32.290]  After we've got 16 videos, then what?
[11:32.290 --> 11:39.290]  Then the comment leavers will comment which team they think is overall the best fall team.
[11:39.290 --> 11:40.290]  Oh, that's a great idea.
[11:40.290 --> 11:42.390]  And then we will determine a winner through that.
[11:42.450 --> 11:46.530]  If you are a regulation listener, do not waste it on this.
[11:47.570 --> 11:50.070]  No, this is gonna be a great time.
[11:50.230 --> 11:50.810]  I have...
[11:50.810 --> 11:51.670]  Oh, I'm excited.
[11:52.130 --> 11:54.630]  Yeah, should we have a disclaimer at the beginning of this to not...
[11:54.630 --> 11:57.410]  If you've just found F*** Face, don't listen to this first.
[11:59.150 --> 12:00.530]  That's a great primer, though.
[12:01.470 --> 12:03.690]  How close our friendships are and how well we all get along.
[12:04.430 --> 12:06.070]  How much we like and respect each other.
[12:06.450 --> 12:09.530]  So, how do I submit my falls? Do I Slack them to you?
[12:09.910 --> 12:13.570]  You can just say them over the thing and then they can be added.
[12:13.810 --> 12:14.270]  Say them?
[12:14.550 --> 12:15.250]  Yeah, just say them.
[12:15.410 --> 12:17.150]  I go first, I'll do mine first.
[12:17.510 --> 12:18.810]  Alright, I'm gonna say my first fall.
[12:19.070 --> 12:20.050]  No, no, no, no, stop!
[12:20.890 --> 12:21.990]  Oh my god.
[12:26.470 --> 12:32.510]  You can cut that out.
[12:34.590 --> 12:35.790]  What the f***?
[12:37.030 --> 12:38.710]  I just said it, Andrew said to say it.
[12:38.830 --> 12:39.930]  Mine is...
[12:41.990 --> 12:43.790]  What do you mean I said to say it?
[12:43.910 --> 12:45.090]  Okay, so I figured it out.
[12:45.130 --> 12:45.290]  Okay.
[12:45.290 --> 12:51.930]  So, you guys can copy the links on your phones and submit them into this list as you are...
[12:53.150 --> 12:55.690]  Boy, that looked like a middle distance stare from Gavin.
[12:56.730 --> 13:00.750]  Or, you can tell me what to search for and I can search for it.
[13:00.750 --> 13:02.490]  I just got four links, can I Slack them to you?
[13:02.550 --> 13:03.230]  Yeah, absolutely.
[13:03.730 --> 13:05.670]  Do you not have names for your links?
[13:06.570 --> 13:07.190]  I have them all...
[13:07.810 --> 13:10.270]  No, that's not a name.
[13:10.650 --> 13:11.290]  It's not a name.
[13:12.690 --> 13:14.570]  So, here's what needs to happen now.
[13:15.130 --> 13:16.210]  There's five of us.
[13:16.570 --> 13:20.270]  And we have to determine the order in which we are drafting.
[13:20.490 --> 13:23.450]  I have to figure out which one of these fails I will show you guys.
[13:23.470 --> 13:25.030]  But when do we watch all the videos?
[13:26.150 --> 13:27.570]  As they get picked.
[13:27.730 --> 13:28.350]  As they're selected.
[13:28.850 --> 13:30.930]  So, we pick before watching them?
[13:33.690 --> 13:36.010]  That's the whole point of the research, you idiot.
[13:36.490 --> 13:40.970]  You think an NFL team doesn't watch a player play football until you pick them?
[13:41.430 --> 13:42.470]  Disrespectful with his language.
[13:42.590 --> 13:44.010]  No, it's just an insane take.
[13:44.010 --> 13:45.490]  It's like, oh, we drafted this guy.
[13:45.550 --> 13:48.370]  I've never seen him play before.
[13:48.590 --> 13:52.130]  So, you're saying I should have already seen Geoff's falls?
[13:52.610 --> 13:55.150]  No, you see your falls.
[13:55.570 --> 13:58.150]  You have a list of your favorite falls.
[13:59.310 --> 14:01.410]  Yeah, and maybe they will not overlap.
[14:01.990 --> 14:04.710]  So, he makes the pick and maybe you're like, oh, I know that fall.
[14:04.790 --> 14:05.690]  That's a great fall.
[14:05.810 --> 14:07.630]  Or it'll be like, I don't know that fall.
[14:07.870 --> 14:08.990]  Then we'll watch the fall.
[14:09.210 --> 14:12.290]  Then you can deem if you think that that fall was worth where it was selected.
[14:12.930 --> 14:13.670]  Or just laugh.
[14:14.010 --> 14:14.470]  At it.
[14:15.410 --> 14:17.490]  I don't understand how this is confusing.
[14:18.090 --> 14:18.870]  I'm not confused.
[14:21.290 --> 14:22.170]  Here's the thing.
[14:22.490 --> 14:26.850]  I know exactly what's happening the whole time with this draft.
[14:27.270 --> 14:31.090]  I just think it's fucking batshit the way that it's happening.
[14:31.990 --> 14:33.170]  So, when...
[14:33.170 --> 14:36.210]  But I was already talked down because you can draft a monkey or whatever.
[14:36.970 --> 14:37.850]  So, you're saying that...
[14:37.850 --> 14:40.350]  So, when would I see Geoff, one of Geoff's?
[14:40.590 --> 14:42.310]  So, okay, Geoff is...
[14:42.310 --> 14:43.410]  We're gonna determine the draft.
[14:43.410 --> 14:45.230]  I thought we already had the draft order by where it was.
[14:45.310 --> 14:46.210]  I'm fine with the draft order.
[14:46.510 --> 14:49.070]  No, no, no, I would like to randomize the draft order.
[14:49.830 --> 14:52.890]  I hope there's one person in the audience who's as confused as I am.
[14:52.930 --> 14:55.050]  Because I'm feeling like a real thick piece of shit right now.
[14:57.150 --> 15:00.170]  Whoever drafts first will say what the thing is.
[15:00.690 --> 15:01.830]  And then we'll watch it.
[15:01.890 --> 15:04.350]  But they'll talk about it and they'll, like, lead into it.
[15:04.650 --> 15:06.150]  So, we're just picking our own falls?
[15:07.830 --> 15:08.230]  Yes.
[15:09.250 --> 15:09.650]  Yes.
[15:10.030 --> 15:12.270]  But your falls might be my falls.
[15:12.270 --> 15:14.170]  It might be Geoff's falls.
[15:14.390 --> 15:18.590]  That's true. You might, from the infinite number of falls that you can pick on the internet...
[15:18.590 --> 15:20.010]  There's some iconic falls.
[15:20.830 --> 15:23.370]  I think I have at least one fall that's on Eric's list.
[15:23.470 --> 15:25.650]  And I feel like I have another fall that should be on everybody's list.
[15:25.790 --> 15:26.150]  You don't.
[15:26.570 --> 15:29.170]  I guarantee you don't have falls on my list.
[15:29.450 --> 15:31.410]  How dare you even...
[15:31.410 --> 15:32.150]  What do you mean?
[15:33.370 --> 15:36.950]  So, you said you had, like, 12 videos.
[15:37.550 --> 15:40.970]  I have 12 falls and the links for each one of them.
[15:40.970 --> 15:43.110]  But we're only going to see four of them?
[15:43.550 --> 15:43.690]  Yes.
[15:43.870 --> 15:47.650]  Because I don't know, you might take some of my falls.
[15:48.210 --> 15:49.650]  Okay, this is what I thought was happening.
[15:49.830 --> 15:52.390]  We were going to watch all these videos in a big pool.
[15:52.890 --> 15:54.950]  And then we were going to pick...
[15:54.950 --> 15:56.650]  We're not going to watch them in a pool.
[15:57.510 --> 15:58.410]  Yeah, when you pick...
[15:58.410 --> 16:00.270]  Yeah, no, hey, Gavin, right.
[16:00.690 --> 16:03.390]  And that's what I brought up last week.
[16:03.890 --> 16:05.230]  And everyone shouted me down.
[16:05.890 --> 16:06.490]  And here we are.
[16:07.450 --> 16:08.290]  Gavin was confused.
[16:08.430 --> 16:10.890]  I don't think I had an opinion because I didn't understand what was happening.
[16:10.970 --> 16:12.510]  Geoff, did you figure out your four?
[16:12.950 --> 16:14.950]  I'm fucking working on it, guys.
[16:15.150 --> 16:17.790]  Okay, so, here's how we're going to sequence the draft order.
[16:18.150 --> 16:20.190]  I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[16:20.570 --> 16:24.970]  Geoff is 1, Gavin is 2, Andrew is 3, I am 4, Nick is 5.
[16:25.030 --> 16:28.290]  However, we are going to randomize this and change the order.
[16:28.490 --> 16:28.710]  Okay.
[16:28.930 --> 16:32.310]  It will be Eric, Gavin, Andrew, Nick, Geoff.
[16:34.010 --> 16:34.530]  Yeah, okay.
[16:35.390 --> 16:36.750]  I guarantee you guys know how to do this.
[16:36.750 --> 16:36.990]  Okay.
[16:37.570 --> 16:40.630]  I tried to go pretty obscure with some of them.
[16:40.630 --> 16:42.730]  Should I just slack? I'll just slack these to you, Eric.
[16:42.810 --> 16:45.390]  I would say slack them to me as you make your pick.
[16:45.710 --> 16:45.910]  Okay.
[16:46.390 --> 16:47.970]  I'm just going to slack them on you.
[16:48.750 --> 16:49.670]  No, no, no, no.
[16:50.110 --> 16:53.110]  You can announce it and then you can send me the video.
[16:53.450 --> 16:54.790]  Yeah, don't send it to me early.
[16:56.630 --> 16:58.370]  I'm not sure what's confusing about what I said.
[16:58.850 --> 16:59.070]  Okay.
[16:59.850 --> 17:01.150]  Send it to me when you make your pick.
[17:02.050 --> 17:02.770]  That's good, right?
[17:03.070 --> 17:03.810]  I get it.
[17:04.850 --> 17:05.210]  Gavin?
[17:05.610 --> 17:05.970]  Makes sense.
[17:06.070 --> 17:07.330]  I'm getting my first one ready, right?
[17:07.790 --> 17:08.990]  I am making the first pick.
[17:11.170 --> 17:11.830]  Let's see it.
[17:12.530 --> 17:13.050]  Mine's easy.
[17:13.850 --> 17:14.910]  Like, we can just look it up if you want to.
[17:15.090 --> 17:15.650]  It's Grape Lady.
[17:18.270 --> 17:20.010]  There's no way it's not the number one pick.
[17:20.690 --> 17:20.770]  Right?
[17:20.930 --> 17:21.250]  Can we?
[17:21.950 --> 17:27.050]  Yeah, no, it's a definite top two, top three for sure.
[17:27.810 --> 17:28.590]  We have to watch it.
[17:28.830 --> 17:31.270]  So anyone who went first should have picked that, right?
[17:31.350 --> 17:31.610]  Yes.
[17:32.170 --> 17:34.210]  Yeah, I think it's pretty consistent.
[17:34.390 --> 17:39.490]  So if you're listening to this, I assume in the description we'll have a link to these falls.
[17:40.150 --> 17:41.910]  Oh, we're going to put the full list down.
[17:42.310 --> 17:42.950]  Is that max volume?
[17:43.710 --> 17:48.670]  Actually, I made all my falls on YouTube because I thought we could maybe...
[17:53.080 --> 17:54.340]  Is Andrew watching this?
[17:55.260 --> 17:56.100]  He can see it.
[17:56.140 --> 17:56.780]  I'm going to queue it up now.
[17:57.620 --> 17:58.340]  I can't see it.
[17:58.420 --> 17:59.640]  Oh, he can't see it. Shit.
[17:59.780 --> 18:01.940]  Yeah, you need to cast it to stream it to Andrew.
[18:07.020 --> 18:09.200]  I forgot the setup there was to this fall.
[18:09.500 --> 18:11.400]  Oh, no, it's worth it though.
[18:11.600 --> 18:11.900]  It is.
[18:12.240 --> 18:16.060]  Oh, and 100% it's worth it because she falls because she tries to trick the other lady.
[18:16.060 --> 18:17.600]  She's a little fucking cheater is what she is.
[18:17.880 --> 18:18.660]  Yeah, she is.
[18:18.720 --> 18:20.040]  And now she's cheating with broken ribs.
[18:20.300 --> 18:21.380]  I don't know.
[18:21.380 --> 18:28.960]  Oh, oh, oh.
[18:28.960 --> 18:30.040]  Oh, oh, oh.
[18:33.100 --> 18:35.660]  Oh, oh, oh.
[18:36.020 --> 18:37.460]  Oh, oh, oh.
[18:38.080 --> 18:39.160]  Oh, oh, oh.
[18:39.160 --> 18:39.400]  Oh, oh, oh.
[18:39.400 --> 18:40.260]  That is a barrel.
[18:40.260 --> 18:46.040]  As I said, it's a top fall and it's the fact that she tries to trick the lady, which really makes it...
[18:46.040 --> 18:48.800]  The sound is incredible, but the attempt at trickery.
[18:49.180 --> 18:51.140]  I always forget how long that goes on.
[18:51.260 --> 18:53.300]  It's so long.
[18:54.020 --> 18:54.200]  Yeah.
[18:55.000 --> 18:56.100]  That's a great pick.
[18:56.580 --> 18:57.140]  Grape Lady Falls.
[18:57.360 --> 19:00.100]  That to me, Grape Lady Falls is number one with a bullet.
[19:00.480 --> 19:08.380]  See, I had Grape Lady 2 only because I feel like our show has a fall that should be arguably taken for granted.
[19:08.380 --> 19:09.500]  Very interesting.
[19:09.880 --> 19:10.680]  Our show has a fall?
[19:11.180 --> 19:12.600]  Yeah. Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[19:14.000 --> 19:14.160]  Okay.
[19:14.900 --> 19:16.820]  We've had several fall talks on the show.
[19:17.320 --> 19:19.460]  I guess we got like, does it do?
[19:22.000 --> 19:23.460]  That may or may not be on my list.
[19:23.460 --> 19:24.800]  Which is not a great fall.
[19:25.520 --> 19:26.820]  How do I get...
[19:26.820 --> 19:27.860]  I disagree with that.
[19:29.540 --> 19:30.200]  Oh, man.
[19:30.680 --> 19:31.660]  So who goes next?
[19:32.200 --> 19:34.580]  It will be... hang on, give me just a second to guess this.
[19:34.600 --> 19:35.340]  No worries, man, you take your time.
[19:38.240 --> 19:39.160]  I think it'll be...
[19:39.160 --> 19:40.260]  Were you looking forward to today or not?
[19:40.980 --> 19:41.300]  Was.
[19:43.500 --> 19:46.620]  The thing about Eric, too, is that he's not performative in any way.
[19:46.740 --> 19:47.780]  This is how he really feels.
[19:47.800 --> 19:48.940]  This is 100% how I feel.
[19:48.940 --> 19:51.520]  This is what you've done to him.
[19:51.520 --> 19:52.720]  So that is the first.
[19:53.160 --> 19:57.860]  Gavin has the second pick in the F*** Face Falls Snake draft.
[19:57.980 --> 19:59.700]  Gavin has slacked me.
[20:00.860 --> 20:02.480]  And you could hear it the whole time.
[20:03.300 --> 20:03.940]  Gavin's fall.
[20:04.160 --> 20:04.640]  It's a classic.
[20:08.340 --> 20:09.020]  Oh, this is a good one.
[20:09.200 --> 20:10.520]  Guy standing outside in the snow.
[20:10.720 --> 20:12.180]  He's got some warm weather. He's a news reporter.
[20:26.230 --> 20:26.590]  Great.
[20:26.770 --> 20:27.750]  Gavin, Gavin.
[20:28.010 --> 20:28.330]  Classic.
[20:29.550 --> 20:29.990]  Fantastic.
[20:29.990 --> 20:34.910]  That is reporter flipped by sled during news report.
[20:35.090 --> 20:35.570]  Very good.
[20:36.250 --> 20:39.070]  Andrew, it's time for you to submit your fail.
[20:39.590 --> 20:40.710]  These are...
[20:41.610 --> 20:42.550]  Jesus, dude.
[20:42.610 --> 20:43.190]  I can't stop.
[20:43.350 --> 20:43.790]  Goddamn.
[20:44.070 --> 20:48.450]  Andrew, the third selection in the F*** Face Falls Snake draft.
[20:48.810 --> 20:50.770]  This is really tough.
[20:51.310 --> 20:51.710]  Are you sending it to me?
[20:52.370 --> 20:55.010]  Yeah, I'll slack you the link to it.
[20:55.030 --> 20:56.350]  I need to decide what I want to pick.
[20:57.330 --> 20:58.510]  Where are you on the board?
[20:58.590 --> 20:59.450]  You're first, right?
[20:59.450 --> 21:02.290]  So I could get that in the swing.
[21:02.810 --> 21:03.850]  Okay, I'm going to go...
[21:03.850 --> 21:07.710]  This is a more recent fall that I discovered last night.
[21:07.890 --> 21:09.390]  I'm going to slack it to you right now.
[21:09.470 --> 21:10.690]  He discovered this last night.
[21:11.110 --> 21:11.510]  I did.
[21:11.790 --> 21:13.830]  It has everything that you want in a fall.
[21:14.030 --> 21:16.030]  It's somebody very publicly falling.
[21:16.710 --> 21:18.290]  You hear it. It's amplified.
[21:18.970 --> 21:20.890]  You get a large reaction to it.
[21:21.790 --> 21:23.190]  It's just a fall or a great fall.
[21:23.330 --> 21:25.470]  I'm taking Afro Man Falls Offstage.
[21:25.470 --> 21:32.300]  Oh my God!
[21:36.640 --> 21:40.720]  You see the bog water fly everywhere.
[21:41.280 --> 21:44.440]  The oh shit, the way he bounces off the mic.
[21:45.740 --> 21:50.260]  A lot of people don't often get out full sentences before they go down.
[21:52.100 --> 21:54.020]  He fully got it all out.
[21:54.260 --> 21:56.100]  Who was it that was autotuned falling recently?
[21:57.220 --> 21:57.540]  Scott?
[21:59.020 --> 22:00.000]  Wow, okay.
[22:00.540 --> 22:01.540]  Andrew, good pick.
[22:01.620 --> 22:03.160]  I want to hear him say oh shit again.
[22:04.060 --> 22:05.020]  Yeah, please.
[22:09.960 --> 22:12.620]  Nick is number four on our draft board list.
[22:12.740 --> 22:13.700]  Nick, do you have a pick?
[22:13.860 --> 22:16.980]  I do. This is a slight compilation of falls.
[22:17.160 --> 22:22.660]  It was a blooper video from a hockey team that was putting out some little promo.
[22:23.920 --> 22:25.260]  I haven't seen this.
[22:25.340 --> 22:25.760]  The mascot.
[22:25.760 --> 22:28.260]  Oh, this is such a good pick.
[22:28.900 --> 22:31.940]  Polar bear mascot keeps slipping on the ice.
[22:33.000 --> 22:34.280]  I can't believe I didn't think of this.
[22:43.320 --> 22:50.170]  I have never seen this.
[23:02.190 --> 23:05.550]  Oh, the impact.
[23:09.310 --> 23:14.120]  Needless to say, I didn't get my deposit back.
[23:14.960 --> 23:16.300]  I can't say his arm is good now.
[23:18.200 --> 23:18.640]  Nick.
[23:27.130 --> 23:28.090]  Keep going, keep going.
[23:28.570 --> 23:42.050]  I've never been such a proud sponsor of Golden Goat for animals.
[23:42.610 --> 23:43.710]  Don't push him!
[23:44.710 --> 23:45.990]  He has a fucking face mask!
[23:49.230 --> 23:51.210]  He looks like a little kid on the ground.
[23:52.670 --> 23:55.490]  The last one is just so real.
[23:58.170 --> 24:00.170]  The gopher had to leave!
[24:03.690 --> 24:08.090]  Nick, that's a great pick. Polar bear mascot keeps slipping on the ice.
[24:08.710 --> 24:11.150]  Nick, that is a great pick.
[24:11.210 --> 24:12.010]  Way to go.
[24:12.290 --> 24:17.310]  I never would have thought that the mascot outfit would be an ideal fall.
[24:17.410 --> 24:19.930]  It seemed to absorb the bloat.
[24:20.110 --> 24:20.670]  Geoff!
[24:21.410 --> 24:23.690]  The last pick in our first round.
[24:24.570 --> 24:32.150]  I'm going to preface my falls by saying I tried to create some own rules for myself within this.
[24:33.110 --> 24:33.990]  And those are...
[24:34.370 --> 24:39.030]  No, because I didn't want to have a bunch of repetition, repeats.
[24:39.170 --> 24:42.810]  So I tried to find falls that are... these are only falls that I discovered this year.
[24:43.010 --> 24:45.610]  They may not be from this year, but I only discovered them this year.
[24:45.730 --> 24:48.530]  And they're falls that I specifically think you guys haven't seen before.
[24:48.530 --> 24:54.070]  So they're maybe not as good as some of the classics you guys are throwing out.
[24:54.370 --> 24:55.330]  But they're just new.
[24:55.790 --> 24:58.350]  And hopefully you guys have fresh eyes on them.
[24:59.330 --> 25:01.110]  By the way, these are in no particular order.
[25:01.410 --> 25:02.010]  This is a TikTok.
[25:02.530 --> 25:05.250]  They're all TikToks. This is just a donkey.
[25:11.030 --> 25:12.350]  This little donkey does a flip.
[25:13.910 --> 25:16.430]  I will say, I have seen that.
[25:16.670 --> 25:17.790]  Oh, you have? I have too.
[25:17.790 --> 25:20.830]  But I never would have thought of it. Great pick.
[25:21.310 --> 25:23.090]  First time I've ever seen it. So it's new to me.
[25:23.230 --> 25:24.970]  That one has great freeze frames.
[25:25.230 --> 25:26.090]  Yeah, it does.
[25:26.890 --> 25:30.010]  There we go. Okay, so this is called do a flip.
[25:30.310 --> 25:33.750]  And it is Geoff's first round pick.
[25:34.830 --> 25:36.230]  I think that's a great pick, Geoff.
[25:36.530 --> 25:40.210]  It's a little out of the ordinary, but here's the fun thing about a snake draft.
[25:41.210 --> 25:42.970]  Snake eats its own tail, so you get to pick again.
[25:43.430 --> 25:43.990]  Oh, okay.
[25:44.450 --> 25:46.730]  Oh, that's what the snake part is? It goes back down the line?
[25:47.370 --> 25:49.570]  Yeah. I apologize.
[25:50.550 --> 25:51.430]  Is that not what it is?
[25:51.450 --> 25:52.590]  No, that's exactly what it is.
[25:53.870 --> 25:55.810]  Because why are we still learning stuff right now?
[25:56.090 --> 25:57.130]  I don't know what this means!
[25:58.730 --> 26:00.310]  What did you just send me?
[26:00.530 --> 26:03.210]  I sent you two through four at once on accident. I apologize.
[26:03.650 --> 26:05.770]  Just pick number two. It's the top one. Just click it. All you gotta do.
[26:06.770 --> 26:08.610]  Alright, now this one is...
[26:08.610 --> 26:12.350]  I thought I made it clear in my reply to the text. I didn't understand what any of that meant.
[26:12.750 --> 26:13.670]  Before you hit play, stop.
[26:14.190 --> 26:18.830]  So now the fall in this one isn't as funny. Let's make sure it's loud so we can hear.
[26:19.330 --> 26:23.890]  The fall itself isn't as funny. It's the aftermath of the fall that I think we can all relate to.
[26:23.990 --> 26:25.370]  So go ahead and rewind it and let's watch it.
[26:25.410 --> 26:26.230]  Okay, here we go. Ready?
[26:26.710 --> 26:27.170]  Yeah.
[26:46.220 --> 26:57.840]  I have watched that one thousand times. Guy falls getting out of his car, gets mad, beats up a palm tree, punches and kicks the tree, and then stomps on the ground and says, fuck this driveway, it's not cool.
[26:58.660 --> 27:04.420]  I guess we'll call it by its actual name. Does anyone... what the fuck?
[27:06.020 --> 27:10.080]  I'm in hell. Does anyone know a good therapist?
[27:11.660 --> 27:12.240]  And then it's that.
[27:12.360 --> 27:15.520]  Once again, probably not the best fall in the world. I just like the story behind it.
[27:15.600 --> 27:17.620]  I like just how small in the frame it is.
[27:19.740 --> 27:23.700]  Yeah, that's a good... those are two fun TikToks. Pretty good. I have not seen that second one.
[27:23.760 --> 27:26.040]  Nick, you have your second pick.
[27:26.040 --> 27:31.540]  Okay, so I debated back and forth between these two and I'll save the next one for the next round.
[27:31.700 --> 27:41.200]  But this is an old clip that I saw on TV a few years ago. It's not the best quality, but this is from a couch race that goes slightly awry. A downhill couch race.
[27:41.280 --> 27:48.860]  I love the way Nick sets this up is like America's Funniest Home Videos. It goes a little awry.
[27:49.060 --> 27:50.800]  And I can confirm he is not in the monkey nest.
[27:53.720 --> 27:58.020]  Okay, there's no sound. It's going. It's flying. Oh, my God.
[28:05.080 --> 28:06.340]  They're all fine, by the way.
[28:06.960 --> 28:09.640]  There's no way that guy that ate the couch at the bottom is fine.
[28:13.440 --> 28:15.180]  It goes bad there.
[28:16.240 --> 28:17.260]  Full leg battles.
[28:19.920 --> 28:22.980]  One of those dudes did like six full flips.
[28:25.060 --> 28:26.640]  That's a great one, Nick.
[28:26.760 --> 28:29.300]  That one makes one of mine look like dog shit.
[28:29.580 --> 28:31.280]  That's incredible.
[28:31.420 --> 28:32.340]  And it's an ingrat.
[28:34.700 --> 28:36.000]  Nick's pick is a gif.
[28:37.620 --> 28:38.980]  That's a great one.
[28:39.180 --> 28:43.720]  I want to know about couch racing. I feel like I would assume that happens all the time.
[28:43.720 --> 28:45.160]  That can't be a rare occurrence.
[28:45.180 --> 28:49.060]  That might be something for us to look into in our...
[28:50.340 --> 28:51.100]  Off to the cheese rolling.
[28:51.240 --> 28:52.920]  Supplemental content that we were talking about doing.
[28:52.920 --> 28:55.020]  A little sports podcast thing.
[28:55.300 --> 28:56.960]  Idea Andrew and Eric and I had.
[28:57.080 --> 28:57.580]  I like it.
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.240]  Andrew, your second pick.
[29:01.660 --> 29:02.860]  I'm in a really tough spot.
[29:03.060 --> 29:05.020]  Because I have one pick that I love.
[29:05.020 --> 29:06.420]  I love two of these picks.
[29:06.820 --> 29:10.380]  One of them I feel like it would be a disaster if it reached the third.
[29:10.520 --> 29:12.160]  I have a first grand grade on it.
[29:12.420 --> 29:15.160]  But the other one I feel like Eric might take.
[29:15.800 --> 29:17.280]  It's a great...
[29:17.280 --> 29:20.460]  I'm going to take the one Eric takes.
[29:20.640 --> 29:21.760]  I think Eric would have.
[29:23.300 --> 29:26.400]  Instead of the first one and hope it falls to me in the third.
[29:26.940 --> 29:27.960]  Which I'd be shocked if it did.
[29:28.440 --> 29:31.260]  This is a clip that has a little bit of set up to it.
[29:31.340 --> 29:32.500]  I'll slack it to you right now.
[29:33.520 --> 29:37.760]  It is about a wrestler named the Shockmaster.
[29:38.060 --> 29:38.160]  Yeah!
[29:39.780 --> 29:40.740]  Shockmaster is a good one.
[29:40.740 --> 29:42.080]  The Shockmaster is a great one.
[29:43.660 --> 29:44.860]  This is...
[29:44.860 --> 29:46.240]  All time classic.
[29:46.620 --> 29:48.140]  This was none other.
[29:49.480 --> 29:51.180]  Ric Flair, the nature boy.
[29:52.860 --> 29:54.280]  Psycho Sid Vicious.
[29:54.760 --> 29:55.360]  Sting.
[29:55.720 --> 29:56.800]  British Bulldog.
[29:57.100 --> 29:57.740]  Harlem Heat.
[30:03.790 --> 30:04.550]  Oh, look at this Stinger.
[30:11.100 --> 30:13.840]  Shockmaster I think was supposed to be like a medicine villain.
[30:13.880 --> 30:16.400]  He was supposed to be a serious character.
[30:16.920 --> 30:17.400]  This is...
[30:20.220 --> 30:21.300]  This is...
[30:21.300 --> 30:22.940]  Classic WCW too.
[30:23.200 --> 30:23.820]  Oh, man.
[30:27.410 --> 30:28.210]  This is...
[30:28.210 --> 30:29.530]  This is so bad.
[30:29.690 --> 30:30.470]  I've seen it so many times.
[30:30.970 --> 30:31.750]  It's classic internet.
[30:32.270 --> 30:38.960]  Oh, it's so good.
[30:39.120 --> 30:39.700]  I have...
[30:39.700 --> 30:40.800]  I can't...
[30:50.280 --> 30:51.480]  It's so long.
[30:52.020 --> 30:54.080]  Why is Rick just standing in the back of the door?
[31:00.640 --> 31:02.120]  Everyone's like covering each other up.
[31:02.120 --> 31:02.360]  Yes.
[31:03.660 --> 31:04.600]  Here it comes.
[31:04.600 --> 31:05.140]  Oh!
[31:15.440 --> 31:16.200]  There's everything.
[31:16.400 --> 31:17.280]  He's covered in glitter.
[31:17.460 --> 31:21.420]  He's wearing a Stormtrooper hat he can't see out of or speak out of.
[31:24.560 --> 31:25.440]  I can't.
[31:25.560 --> 31:26.380]  Oh, my God.
[31:26.600 --> 31:27.080]  It's great.
[31:27.320 --> 31:31.660]  So for context of what happened, they tested that before and it worked fine.
[31:31.660 --> 31:36.100]  And then another wrestler put a 2x4 in at the bottom so he would fall.
[31:36.100 --> 31:36.600]  Is that true?
[31:36.880 --> 31:37.840]  It was a set-up prank.
[31:38.420 --> 31:39.420]  Oh, my God.
[31:39.700 --> 31:40.280]  It is infamous.
[31:40.360 --> 31:44.860]  It was an established prank and it also derailed that guy's career.
[31:45.160 --> 31:48.340]  He was supposed to be this villain, this serious villain.
[31:48.900 --> 31:50.160]  And Eric, you can correct me if I'm wrong.
[31:50.340 --> 31:54.520]  From what I understand, he then became an idiot who fell over a lot.
[31:55.340 --> 31:56.180]  After that for a while.
[31:56.180 --> 31:57.000]  Before he was in...
[31:57.000 --> 31:58.120]  It ruined his entire career.
[31:58.140 --> 31:59.300]  A 2x4 changed his whole career.
[32:00.080 --> 32:01.740]  A 2x4 altered his past.
[32:01.760 --> 32:04.200]  He was in the natural disasters in the WWF.
[32:05.180 --> 32:06.480]  And then he was Tugboat.
[32:06.940 --> 32:07.760]  And then...
[32:07.760 --> 32:09.380]  He was Trippy the Fall Fighter.
[32:09.460 --> 32:11.460]  Yeah, here is... that's the Shockmaster.
[32:11.680 --> 32:13.780]  God, that's a... Andrew, that's a good one, man.
[32:13.820 --> 32:14.200]  That's great.
[32:14.400 --> 32:14.660]  Way to go.
[32:15.280 --> 32:16.180]  Was that on your list, Eric?
[32:16.200 --> 32:18.740]  It was not because I don't want to watch it ever again.
[32:20.020 --> 32:21.380]  It's good on that list.
[32:21.460 --> 32:22.080]  I hate it.
[32:22.140 --> 32:23.200]  I hate it so much.
[32:23.300 --> 32:24.300]  Is it because it cheapens wrestling?
[32:24.800 --> 32:25.160]  No.
[32:25.320 --> 32:25.840]  Oh, no, no, no.
[32:25.900 --> 32:26.440]  That's about...
[32:26.440 --> 32:27.620]  That's WCW.
[32:27.820 --> 32:28.340]  At its finest.
[32:28.480 --> 32:29.400]  I mean, really.
[32:30.020 --> 32:33.020]  That's Boccia Mania fucking like the worst of the worst.
[32:33.100 --> 32:34.000]  And it's so hard.
[32:34.060 --> 32:35.540]  Like, I like when wrestling goes right.
[32:35.640 --> 32:36.900]  And boy, when it goes wrong, it's hard.
[32:37.180 --> 32:39.580]  Gavin, you have your first second round pick.
[32:39.640 --> 32:40.360]  Well, I guess it's your first...
[32:40.360 --> 32:41.200]  It's your second round pick.
[32:41.740 --> 32:48.980]  This is a video showing the dangers of using those forked hand truck things when unloaded.
[32:50.980 --> 32:53.000]  This may be inappropriate for some viewers.
[32:53.300 --> 32:54.040]  Oh, please.
[32:54.200 --> 32:54.700]  That's a great start.
[32:56.040 --> 32:57.580]  Oh, the music is so good.
[32:57.620 --> 32:58.360]  Yeah, it really is.
[33:00.890 --> 33:01.870]  Oh, my God.
[33:01.870 --> 33:02.910]  What are you doing?
[33:06.090 --> 33:07.210]  No way.
[33:07.730 --> 33:08.250]  Walk it off.
[33:08.590 --> 33:10.990]  The commitment to holding on to it.
[33:11.450 --> 33:12.010]  Unbelievable.
[33:12.290 --> 33:14.090]  The way his legs just lock.
[33:19.150 --> 33:21.490]  It's like a full frog formation.
[33:21.910 --> 33:25.950]  He frogs in the air and lands completely flat like a fallen pencil.
[33:26.670 --> 33:28.490]  I don't understand how that happened.
[33:28.590 --> 33:29.310]  He got trebleshaded.
[33:29.910 --> 33:33.130]  How did he get into the truck to not realize that it wasn't lowered?
[33:33.870 --> 33:36.810]  Well, I assume he was trying to push it towards the edge and then lower it.
[33:37.190 --> 33:38.930]  Yeah, and then he just caught the edge.
[33:39.290 --> 33:40.910]  Oh, you went too far? Okay, I see.
[33:41.410 --> 33:41.990]  That's a great one.
[33:42.090 --> 33:43.710]  That's probably the most brutal one on my list.
[33:43.930 --> 33:44.370]  That's a good one.
[33:44.470 --> 33:46.270]  And it's definitely the worst day of that guy's life.
[33:47.590 --> 33:48.610]  You would hope.
[33:49.370 --> 33:50.390]  The freeze frame.
[33:52.230 --> 33:52.990]  Zorb reporter.
[33:56.730 --> 33:58.470]  I forgot about this.
[33:58.730 --> 33:59.310]  Hey, cheers, Maddie.
[34:00.530 --> 34:01.570]  Live leak.
[34:05.810 --> 34:19.500]  Okay, there are so many things I love about this.
[34:20.060 --> 34:22.500]  Watch, don't anticipate the fall.
[34:23.080 --> 34:26.180]  Watch her as the director is calling action.
[34:27.500 --> 34:30.100]  Action, Zorb!
[34:30.960 --> 34:32.520]  I love the little half go.
[34:32.940 --> 34:34.340]  The preemptive jump.
[34:39.140 --> 34:40.260]  So great.
[34:40.560 --> 34:45.320]  The fact that the green bit comes around and hits her directly makes it look like it fell out of the sky.
[34:45.460 --> 34:50.120]  So my second pick is female reporter hit and owned by Zorb.
[34:50.580 --> 34:51.580]  Hit and owned.
[34:53.640 --> 34:55.720]  That's like a Mega 64 classic.
[34:55.960 --> 34:57.720]  We would watch that constantly.
[34:57.740 --> 35:01.680]  So as it's a snake draft, I have another pick.
[35:02.220 --> 35:03.680]  My third pick.
[35:05.840 --> 35:06.720]  Let's see.
[35:07.340 --> 35:07.900]  You know what?
[35:09.440 --> 35:13.740]  Okay, I'm going with I'll show me.
[35:15.600 --> 35:17.520]  This is from Jackass 4.5.
[35:18.260 --> 35:20.640]  I'm Poopies and I'll show me.
[35:38.040 --> 35:39.300]  I'll show me.
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  I gotta say, Poopies is very funny.
[35:46.180 --> 35:49.160]  That was not in the movie.
[35:49.820 --> 35:52.900]  It's in 4.5 and that's unbelievable.
[35:53.460 --> 35:55.300]  I think 4.5 was as good as the movie.
[35:56.300 --> 35:57.300]  I'll show me.
[35:57.860 --> 35:58.960]  I love that.
[35:59.260 --> 36:00.040]  Great pick.
[36:00.040 --> 36:02.900]  4.5 had the 2 Spicy Icy in it.
[36:02.940 --> 36:03.680]  Oh, that's right.
[36:05.420 --> 36:05.860]  Geoff!
[36:07.180 --> 36:08.120]  Oh no, I'm sorry.
[36:08.680 --> 36:09.340]  It's Gavin.
[36:09.600 --> 36:11.140]  Because Geoff has two in a row at the end.
[36:12.200 --> 36:14.100]  Alright, shut the fuck up.
[36:15.340 --> 36:16.120]  We all know how it works.
[36:16.480 --> 36:19.160]  This one is definitely overshadowed by Nick's couch one.
[36:19.560 --> 36:24.580]  I like this because it reminds me of the guy hitting the propeller in the Titanic.
[36:24.980 --> 36:25.200]  Ooh.
[36:26.900 --> 36:27.780]  Jesus Christ.
[36:28.160 --> 36:28.600]  What?
[36:30.040 --> 36:32.380]  And it's less damaging than Nick's?
[36:32.800 --> 36:36.020]  This jockey walks away from a spectacular somersaulting fall.
[36:36.480 --> 36:37.140]  Okay.
[36:41.160 --> 36:41.920]  Oh!
[36:47.420 --> 36:48.180]  Wow!
[36:54.720 --> 36:56.240]  That's insane!
[36:57.240 --> 36:59.600]  Never seen that level of rotation in a horse race.
[36:59.600 --> 36:59.960]  Oh!
[37:02.040 --> 37:02.480]  Dude!
[37:03.480 --> 37:05.940]  It's like you fell off the horse, hit the barrier.
[37:06.640 --> 37:09.720]  Yeah, I don't know if the horse was like going the other way or like...
[37:09.720 --> 37:11.480]  It looks like he just jumped off.
[37:11.480 --> 37:12.400]  Dove left, yeah.
[37:12.700 --> 37:14.680]  How did he do that?
[37:14.820 --> 37:17.740]  I guess he got really lucky that he was that high up.
[37:17.800 --> 37:21.340]  Because if he was like a foot further down, I'm sure that would have hurt way, way more.
[37:21.660 --> 37:22.100]  How?
[37:23.040 --> 37:24.000]  Oh my God.
[37:24.700 --> 37:25.140]  Okay.
[37:26.440 --> 37:28.340]  Andrew, your third pick.
[37:29.260 --> 37:31.180]  Oh man, this is...
[37:31.180 --> 37:34.460]  I'm gonna go, and I'm shocked that this, this is my number one fall.
[37:34.800 --> 37:37.680]  But I was worried, as I said, about Eric taking the shock master.
[37:38.000 --> 37:39.180]  This is number one on my list.
[37:39.500 --> 37:42.040]  I think this should be number one on all of our lists.
[37:42.140 --> 37:44.860]  This is a fall that we discovered as a group.
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.860]  I feel like, maybe not entirely, but most of us did.
[37:48.260 --> 37:49.300]  It's an iconic fall.
[37:49.860 --> 37:51.160]  He's near and dear to our heart.
[37:51.460 --> 37:57.380]  How could we have a fall draft without picking Don Zimmer's legendary fall?
[37:58.920 --> 37:59.320]  Flashback.
[38:00.560 --> 38:03.580]  Getting shifted into the dirt by Pedro Martinez.
[38:03.880 --> 38:07.400]  They call it a push. It's not so much a push as much as he, like, steps away.
[38:07.800 --> 38:08.700]  It's like a bull.
[38:10.340 --> 38:15.980]  He puts the hat in his face and sidesteps, and Don Zimmer just can't stop his own momentum.
[38:16.420 --> 38:19.260]  Those aren't even up and in, but that's, that's Manny being Manny right there.
[38:30.800 --> 38:33.160]  What are you gonna do about how old Don Zimmer wasn't?
[38:33.160 --> 38:35.200]  Oh, yeah.
[38:36.620 --> 38:41.500]  I love the announcers here, because they're disgusted by it.
[38:41.620 --> 38:46.140]  It's like, what the fuck? What was he supposed to do?
[38:47.900 --> 38:49.040]  There's nothing you can do.
[38:49.260 --> 38:51.420]  He sidestepped. It's not like he punched it.
[38:51.840 --> 38:54.300]  Andrew, that's a very good pick.
[38:54.420 --> 38:57.320]  That is a fall that has brought me joy since we found it.
[38:57.400 --> 39:00.360]  I will just randomly watch that in the evening. It's great.
[39:00.500 --> 39:02.460]  I love that fall so much. It has to be on the board.
[39:02.460 --> 39:04.180]  It's on Nick.
[39:04.760 --> 39:11.220]  Okay, so I have a kind of a theme with the ice ones, but I do love this video of this guy just trying to go to work.
[39:12.320 --> 39:12.760]  Epic.
[39:13.200 --> 39:15.700]  Was not expecting ice on the driveway.
[39:24.140 --> 39:27.620]  I love his little, he tries to surf it for a while.
[39:28.900 --> 39:29.900]  I think that's the shuffle.
[39:31.580 --> 39:34.540]  Anyone trying to not fall on ice is always hilarious.
[39:34.580 --> 39:37.940]  And then he definitely hits that sign there as he rolls into it.
[39:38.340 --> 39:39.300]  That's a great one.
[39:39.420 --> 39:40.260]  Nick, good pick.
[39:40.420 --> 39:42.020]  Excellent pick. Also one I've never seen before.
[39:42.060 --> 39:44.500]  You're a big ice fall fan.
[39:44.540 --> 39:45.500]  I like ice falls. They're funny.
[39:45.640 --> 39:47.020]  Okay. I like it.
[39:48.520 --> 39:49.480]  Geoff's last two.
[39:49.600 --> 39:52.840]  My third pick, it's going to be called, I Mean He Warned Him.
[39:53.160 --> 39:54.700]  And it's similar to the second one.
[39:55.260 --> 39:59.500]  The fall is only a part of the story, and the story is, I think, what makes it so funny.
[39:59.900 --> 40:00.660]  So we'll see right here.
[40:00.700 --> 40:02.140]  There's also something I would say before you hit play.
[40:03.220 --> 40:08.060]  I have stopped riding my bike right now for this very reason.
[40:08.260 --> 40:08.340]  Really?
[40:08.700 --> 40:09.920]  Too dangerous to ride your bike right now.
[40:09.920 --> 40:10.080]  Really?
[40:10.400 --> 40:11.680]  Yeah. So go in Texas, right?
[40:11.680 --> 40:11.940]  Okay.
[40:12.100 --> 40:12.820]  So go ahead and here you go.
[40:12.880 --> 40:13.720]  Here we go. Fasten.
[40:14.740 --> 40:18.820]  Oh, I saw this. This rules.
[40:22.160 --> 40:22.400]  Whoa.
[40:22.540 --> 40:23.200]  Hey, watch out.
[40:25.540 --> 40:26.180]  It's slippery.
[40:32.560 --> 40:33.340]  Yeah, man.
[40:33.500 --> 40:37.520]  The wheel spinning at the end is really kind of beautiful.
[40:37.520 --> 40:38.700]  What's making it slippery?
[40:38.960 --> 40:39.720]  The leaves.
[40:40.060 --> 40:40.800]  Oh, just like...
[40:40.800 --> 40:44.220]  And it's just like wet mossy ground.
[40:44.660 --> 40:45.320]  It's just fall.
[40:45.600 --> 40:49.060]  I Mean He Warned Him is definitely, that's a good one, Geoff.
[40:49.540 --> 40:49.940]  Thank you.
[40:50.040 --> 40:50.440]  Good fall.
[40:50.620 --> 40:54.760]  And then my fourth fall is called Cardboard Wall or What?
[40:54.820 --> 40:55.760]  And it's self-explanatory.
[40:56.700 --> 40:58.020]  Cardboard Wall or What?
[40:58.600 --> 40:59.740]  It's a short one.
[41:08.980 --> 41:13.300]  He's laughing, he's drunk, he falls, his entire head gets stuck in the wall.
[41:13.920 --> 41:14.960]  That's a fun one.
[41:15.020 --> 41:16.000]  And then he just freezes.
[41:16.120 --> 41:16.740]  Oh, man.
[41:16.940 --> 41:18.480]  I'd love to see that from the other side.
[41:20.860 --> 41:22.600]  It's his mom watching Wheel of Fortune.
[41:25.900 --> 41:28.680]  Oh, man. Geoff, those are your four.
[41:28.900 --> 41:29.400]  Those are my four.
[41:29.400 --> 41:34.620]  We'll recap at the end, but those are Geoff's four falls.
[41:35.000 --> 41:40.580]  And maybe after we do all our picks, we could have like an honorable mentions or something like that where we just go over what we didn't pick.
[41:40.660 --> 41:41.900]  Yeah, Geoff can go over his other five.
[41:44.200 --> 41:44.600]  Gavin.
[41:45.200 --> 41:46.580]  Or I'm sorry, it's Nick.
[41:46.700 --> 41:48.900]  I'm shooting ahead to the top.
[41:49.100 --> 41:49.400]  Nick.
[41:49.760 --> 41:53.040]  So this is a Prince Impersonator having a rough time on stage.
[41:53.180 --> 41:55.820]  But the fall is okay, but it's what he does afterwards.
[41:55.900 --> 41:56.120]  Okay.
[41:56.980 --> 41:58.620]  Prince Impersonator falls off stage.
[41:58.620 --> 41:59.680]  Gotta unmute.
[42:12.480 --> 42:13.570]  Sticking with it.
[42:15.050 --> 42:16.900]  That's a consummate professional right there.
[42:17.080 --> 42:19.240]  That's a good one.
[42:19.320 --> 42:19.900]  That's fantastic.
[42:20.520 --> 42:21.200]  That's very funny.
[42:22.180 --> 42:25.580]  Now, we roll on to Andrew.
[42:25.860 --> 42:29.820]  Andrew, what is your fourth and final pick in the Face Falls draft?
[42:30.280 --> 42:31.200]  I have a lot of falls.
[42:31.940 --> 42:32.780]  This is tough.
[42:34.740 --> 42:39.980]  So far, I've gotten everything in my top five outside of Grape Lady, which is an obvious pick.
[42:40.460 --> 42:44.620]  It was mentioned before, and this should play at the specific time in which it happens.
[42:45.220 --> 42:48.140]  I'm taking another draft near and dear to our hearts.
[42:48.400 --> 42:58.540]  This is a fall that is not visually all that impressive, but the damage it causes, for what it is, is wonderful.
[42:59.780 --> 43:00.300]  And here it is.
[43:02.620 --> 43:04.800]  Our first one to that fall.
[43:05.040 --> 43:05.300]  Okay.
[43:07.560 --> 43:09.040]  So you're getting into position.
[43:11.800 --> 43:15.080]  And you break everything.
[43:15.460 --> 43:16.360]  Just the pelvis.
[43:16.740 --> 43:21.560]  It doesn't look terrible, but you couldn't sleep for three weeks after that fall.
[43:21.780 --> 43:22.240]  It's true.
[43:23.000 --> 43:24.760]  My leg was going numb every night.
[43:27.240 --> 43:31.340]  It's the least impressive fall-to-damage ratio I've ever seen.
[43:31.500 --> 43:38.040]  I absolutely agree. It doesn't look like it hurts that much, but we all know that it definitely does.
[43:38.200 --> 43:38.840]  Try to get a good pause.
[43:38.980 --> 43:39.800]  Oh, I definitely will.
[43:39.840 --> 43:43.140]  Yeah, if you freeze-frame, his body, like, crumbles within itself.
[43:43.800 --> 43:44.680]  That's the shove.
[43:45.080 --> 43:46.440]  Oh, everything's gone wrong.
[43:46.440 --> 43:48.340]  That's the way you're in trouble right there. You split the legs.
[43:48.640 --> 43:50.400]  Yeah, the second slip is what really did me.
[43:50.400 --> 43:54.900]  It's the impact. It's like all of your bones try to leave your body.
[43:54.980 --> 43:56.260]  Yeah, bone evacuation.
[43:59.640 --> 44:04.780]  Back and to the left. Back and to the left.
[44:05.320 --> 44:10.080]  The thing is, your hip hits before your hand hits.
[44:10.520 --> 44:13.460]  It is all... look at that hand. Look at that hip.
[44:13.640 --> 44:14.420]  Yeah, it is...
[44:15.160 --> 44:16.940]  You can see the pelvis.
[44:18.840 --> 44:19.480]  Goddamn.
[44:20.260 --> 44:22.240]  That right there, you don't even look like you.
[44:22.380 --> 44:23.100]  It's a great pic.
[44:23.640 --> 44:24.380]  I know it a little.
[44:24.880 --> 44:28.080]  Okay, so now, Gavin's fourth and final pic.
[44:28.280 --> 44:31.600]  Once again, very similar page to Nick with the ice slippage.
[44:32.720 --> 44:38.660]  I even considered Nick's one, but eventually I settled on this one because... just because of the slippers.
[44:38.900 --> 44:43.400]  Not a very... not a super bad fall. This one starts tremendously quickly, so get ready.
[44:43.540 --> 44:45.800]  Man slides down his driveway on ice.
[44:45.820 --> 44:47.440]  I just love the slippers to be honest.
[44:47.440 --> 44:47.920]  Oh!
[44:51.920 --> 44:53.300]  He just keeps going.
[44:54.420 --> 44:55.460]  That is...
[44:55.460 --> 44:56.360]  You gotta see it again.
[44:56.640 --> 44:59.560]  That's the grace of a man who's done that before.
[45:03.680 --> 45:05.740]  His coffee just goes all over the wall.
[45:06.080 --> 45:06.820]  Oh, that's awesome.
[45:07.300 --> 45:12.160]  Man... man fall... man fall and slides down his driveway on ice.
[45:12.280 --> 45:13.360]  That is a steep driveway.
[45:13.540 --> 45:14.340]  Man fall.
[45:14.880 --> 45:15.500]  Man fall.
[45:15.500 --> 45:15.640]  I love it.
[45:15.960 --> 45:16.680]  Man fall.
[45:17.260 --> 45:23.680]  That really is... I think that's kind of like the beauty of this falls thing is that they are written in like the dumbest way
[45:23.680 --> 45:27.020]  because they are truly like the most lowbrow thing that you can do.
[45:27.860 --> 45:31.840]  My final is one that is near and dear to my heart.
[45:31.980 --> 45:34.400]  It's a more recent one. One that I can't get enough of.
[45:34.460 --> 45:36.500]  I keep watching over and over.
[45:36.660 --> 45:39.460]  I don't think this is going to be on anyone else's list or on anyone else's radar.
[45:39.700 --> 45:43.300]  But I love this video. It's called Merry Christmas.
[45:44.080 --> 45:45.120]  Oh, it's holiday themed too.
[45:49.780 --> 45:51.240]  Oh, I've seen this one before.
[46:01.650 --> 46:03.790]  Now, there's so much set up.
[46:04.290 --> 46:05.550]  Watch him in the back.
[46:05.810 --> 46:07.070]  Is it flower to be snow?
[46:07.470 --> 46:10.850]  Watch him checking the wind. He takes his stuff back. Bang.
[46:14.190 --> 46:15.310]  Merry Christmas.
[46:16.710 --> 46:19.750]  I really, I really, really love that.
[46:19.750 --> 46:22.750]  I know that's probably not high on anyone's list, but it is truly...
[46:23.250 --> 46:24.630]  No, I haven't seen that before.
[46:24.630 --> 46:27.770]  Yeah, it's truly a special one to me right now.
[46:27.970 --> 46:29.970]  It is, it's one that I can't stop watching.
[46:30.410 --> 46:34.130]  So there we have it. Our full draft list is completed.
[46:34.830 --> 46:38.490]  Should we talk them through? Do we want to like run them down real quick?
[46:38.690 --> 46:40.410]  Yeah, I think we should run down what everybody has.
[46:40.650 --> 46:42.970]  Eric has Grape Lady Falls.
[46:43.630 --> 46:46.370]  Female reporter hit and owned by Swerve Paul.
[46:47.250 --> 46:49.410]  Jackass 4.5, I'll show me.
[46:49.410 --> 46:51.030]  And Merry Christmas.
[46:51.450 --> 46:55.210]  Gavin. Reporter flipped by sled during news report.
[46:55.910 --> 46:59.570]  How not to unload a truck. Guy flies through the air.
[47:00.150 --> 47:03.290]  This jockey walks away from a spectacular summer salting fall.
[47:03.710 --> 47:06.730]  And man fall and slides down his driveway on ice.
[47:08.170 --> 47:10.790]  Andrew. Afro man falls off stage.
[47:11.230 --> 47:13.890]  The unforgettable debut of the Shockmaster.
[47:14.730 --> 47:19.130]  Flashback to the time when Pedro Martinez threw Don Zimmer to the ground.
[47:19.130 --> 47:21.390]  And does it do easy feet?
[47:22.310 --> 47:28.770]  Nick has. Polar bear mascot keeps slipping over on the ice.
[47:29.850 --> 47:32.410]  Downhill couch race doesn't go as planned.
[47:33.270 --> 47:36.970]  Watch. Man's epic slip down icy driveway.
[47:37.470 --> 47:39.890]  And Prince impersonator falls off stage.
[47:40.330 --> 47:42.030]  Finally, Geoff. Do a flip.
[47:42.490 --> 47:43.830]  Does anyone know a good therapist?
[47:44.330 --> 47:47.150]  I mean, he warned him. And cardboard wall or what?
[47:47.930 --> 47:50.830]  Those are the official Snake Draft falls.
[47:51.950 --> 47:55.750]  I'm excited to see the comment leavers reaction to who they think won this draft.
[47:55.850 --> 47:59.090]  And I'm shocked by how smooth it went once we got going.
[47:59.990 --> 48:01.710]  I totally understand it now.
[48:01.770 --> 48:03.290]  I think this made total sense.
[48:04.590 --> 48:08.070]  I still don't agree with the pooling system, but this was fun.
[48:08.210 --> 48:10.930]  All the times I didn't know what was going on for like 15 straight minutes.
[48:10.990 --> 48:11.610]  Hang on, let me check.
[48:11.890 --> 48:13.930]  You were right to not know what was going on.
[48:13.930 --> 48:14.730]  No, that's in there.
[48:15.290 --> 48:16.930]  Yeah, that's most of the content.
[48:17.590 --> 48:18.690]  That was annoying.
[48:19.150 --> 48:20.150]  I'm annoyed by me.
[48:22.450 --> 48:24.250]  Imagine if it was just explained well to start.
[48:24.610 --> 48:26.770]  Do we want to go through the falls we didn't submit for?
[48:26.930 --> 48:29.010]  I don't think we need a ton of them.
[48:29.150 --> 48:30.650]  I would say pick your best.
[48:31.150 --> 48:31.910]  What's your favorite?
[48:32.430 --> 48:32.590]  Best honorable mention.
[48:32.790 --> 48:33.950]  What's your best honorable mention?
[48:34.010 --> 48:36.310]  We'll go in reverse order too, Geoff, if you want to go first.
[48:37.470 --> 48:38.250]  I'm fine with that.
[48:38.270 --> 48:39.230]  Or you don't have to.
[48:39.350 --> 48:40.530]  We can go in whatever order you guys want.
[48:40.550 --> 48:41.190]  I'll do this one.
[48:41.450 --> 48:43.170]  This isn't a crazy one or anything.
[48:43.570 --> 48:45.610]  I just think that it's...
[48:47.270 --> 48:48.450]  She's just funny.
[48:48.730 --> 48:48.910]  Okay.
[48:49.810 --> 48:51.510]  Her noises are kind of funny.
[48:51.750 --> 48:54.790]  Hashtag funny AF, hashtag epic fail, hashtag faceplant.
[48:56.030 --> 48:56.990]  Make sure there's audio.
[49:04.750 --> 49:05.670]  That's pretty good.
[49:06.110 --> 49:06.630]  I like that one a lot.
[49:06.630 --> 49:07.550]  Just trying to do a somersault.
[49:08.070 --> 49:08.510]  Scorpion.
[49:09.090 --> 49:09.650]  That's great.
[49:10.890 --> 49:11.730]  We go to Nick.
[49:12.470 --> 49:13.290]  I don't have an extra one.
[49:13.290 --> 49:13.710]  Okay, cool.
[49:14.070 --> 49:15.770]  Andrew, do you have a...
[49:15.770 --> 49:16.870]  Yeah, I'll just go...
[49:16.870 --> 49:17.910]  Can I just read my board?
[49:18.030 --> 49:18.190]  Sure.
[49:18.190 --> 49:19.490]  Can I just submit one for watching?
[49:20.490 --> 49:22.610]  I have Madonna falling over.
[49:22.710 --> 49:23.690]  I don't know if you've seen that one.
[49:23.770 --> 49:26.050]  That's great because it's a cape-related incident.
[49:26.550 --> 49:28.330]  I have Charlie Brown kicking.
[49:28.530 --> 49:31.490]  I feel like that's one of the most iconic falls of all time.
[49:31.970 --> 49:32.530]  Always falling.
[49:33.030 --> 49:36.850]  At eight, I have Skyfall, which is maybe the best Bond movie.
[49:36.970 --> 49:38.270]  It's definitely top three.
[49:38.470 --> 49:39.290]  It should be in consideration.
[49:39.930 --> 49:43.090]  I also have, following that, Niagara Falls.
[49:43.210 --> 49:45.370]  One of the all-time great Canadian falls.
[49:46.750 --> 49:47.550]  Number ten...
[49:47.550 --> 49:48.550]  You're a stupid bastard.
[49:50.850 --> 49:53.730]  I have Snow Jogging Couple, which is what I'm going to submit.
[49:54.670 --> 49:55.310]  That's great.
[49:56.110 --> 49:57.350]  I just love that one.
[49:57.450 --> 49:57.830]  Let's see it.
[49:57.850 --> 49:58.670]  Let me open up Slack.
[49:58.810 --> 50:02.370]  Then I have the Travis Scott autotune fall and the Kelsey Grammer fall.
[50:02.890 --> 50:04.750]  Things we've talked about on the show before.
[50:05.770 --> 50:06.190]  Close it.
[50:06.490 --> 50:10.110]  I almost drafted Niagara Falls, but I really wanted Gavin on my board.
[50:10.390 --> 50:11.410]  It was a really tough call.
[50:11.590 --> 50:13.430]  I'm surprised nobody picked the new Post Malone fall.
[50:13.490 --> 50:14.270]  He broke his ribs on that one.
[50:14.270 --> 50:15.110]  Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.
[50:16.070 --> 50:19.550]  It's the perfect texture for running, is what Andrew submitted.
[50:19.650 --> 50:20.510]  I said, what are you doing running?
[50:20.650 --> 50:21.810]  And you're saying it was really good out?
[50:22.070 --> 50:23.690]  It's the perfect texture for running.
[50:23.810 --> 50:24.190]  Very low.
[50:30.580 --> 50:32.080]  More skiers than runners, for sure.
[50:32.180 --> 50:35.300]  I think they've got a little bit of the advantage with the whole stride and glide thing.
[50:35.400 --> 50:36.940]  But it's too nice to not be out here.
[50:37.740 --> 50:39.060]  Go ahead and keep on the run.
[50:39.200 --> 50:39.920]  I'm sorry to have kept you.
[50:39.940 --> 50:41.000]  6.14am.
[50:41.780 --> 50:42.500]  Total psychopath.
[50:42.800 --> 50:47.220]  We've seen a lot of people out here, like you said, running, sledding, just enjoying it.
[50:51.560 --> 50:53.540]  She immediately grabs her back.
[50:54.220 --> 50:57.260]  It's the perfect texture for running.
[50:59.080 --> 51:00.500]  That was great.
[51:00.780 --> 51:00.920]  Yep.
[51:01.240 --> 51:03.120]  Thank you so much for entertaining this dumb idea.
[51:03.460 --> 51:03.620]  Yep.
[51:03.900 --> 51:08.260]  I'll say the one I want to watch is Granny Falls using TikTok filter.
[51:11.120 --> 51:11.680]  Yes.
[51:14.380 --> 51:16.200]  This probably should have been drafted, honestly.
[51:16.200 --> 51:21.780]  What is she going to do?
[51:25.460 --> 51:26.780]  I've never seen that.
[51:28.060 --> 51:29.800]  I definitely could have drafted this.
[51:29.860 --> 51:30.840]  This is high on my board.
[51:31.020 --> 51:33.300]  It's hard to point out when the real Granny fell.
[51:33.580 --> 51:34.720]  Just watch her eyes.
[51:35.080 --> 51:36.280]  She's really...
[51:36.280 --> 51:38.500]  She goes straight down to the ground.
[51:38.940 --> 51:39.420]  There you go.
[51:40.260 --> 51:42.320]  Was she being funny or did she just get disoriented?
[51:42.360 --> 51:43.420]  She got disoriented!
[51:43.760 --> 51:44.380]  There you have it.
[51:45.720 --> 51:46.800]  Oh my god.
[51:47.280 --> 51:48.520]  That was amazing.
[51:49.760 --> 51:50.220]  There you go.
[51:50.320 --> 51:51.340]  That's the snake draft.
[51:51.460 --> 51:52.980]  Well, I've got one of my honorable mentions.
[51:53.080 --> 51:53.620]  Oh, okay, cool.
[51:53.960 --> 51:58.860]  I didn't put it in just because everyone's seen it and I wanted to do some slightly newer stuff, but it's a classic.
[51:59.980 --> 52:00.480]  Oh, yeah.
[52:00.480 --> 52:00.920]  Oh, yeah.
[52:01.020 --> 52:02.060]  Okay, okay, okay.
[52:03.220 --> 52:04.420]  I don't think I've seen this.
[52:04.720 --> 52:05.960]  This is Catch the Ice, dude.
[52:11.740 --> 52:12.460]  Oh, Gavin.
[52:12.640 --> 52:13.420]  Oh, no.
[52:13.420 --> 52:15.300]  Oh, no.
[52:20.860 --> 52:23.080]  This is a man looking at, like, frozen pool.
[52:27.680 --> 52:31.820]  Oh, my god.
[52:34.320 --> 52:35.760]  Motherfucker, fuck the world.
[52:36.580 --> 52:37.440]  Oh, my god.
[52:38.120 --> 52:39.640]  How is Sisql doing these days?
[52:41.920 --> 52:43.400]  Well, that is the end of this episode.
[52:44.920 --> 52:47.160]  Man, that is the... what a draft.
[52:47.420 --> 52:48.940]  What a draft that we've just had.
[52:50.240 --> 52:51.800]  That was really incredible.
[52:51.920 --> 52:53.520]  Andrew, is that about how you wanted it to go?
[52:53.940 --> 52:55.840]  Yeah, that's exactly how I wanted it to go.
[52:55.920 --> 52:56.740]  I thought that was a lot of fun.
[52:56.880 --> 52:57.840]  Oh, Eric just left.
[52:58.100 --> 52:59.000]  No, there was one that...
[52:59.000 --> 52:59.940]  Yeah, it's because I had to disconnect.
[53:00.160 --> 53:01.580]  There was one that I actually couldn't find.
[53:02.220 --> 53:02.780]  What was that?
[53:03.400 --> 53:07.620]  It was an old video from break.com, or big boys, whatever it was at the time.
[53:08.120 --> 53:11.440]  And it was a guy on a snowboard, and the guy filming says,
[53:11.440 --> 53:13.140]  You just gotta do it, bro-ha.
[53:13.340 --> 53:16.220]  And then he comes down and stacks it on a snowboard.
[53:16.380 --> 53:17.500]  I literally can't find the video.
[53:17.660 --> 53:20.180]  If anyone can find, you just gotta do it, bro-ha.
[53:20.820 --> 53:22.280]  The guy on the snowboard.
[53:22.500 --> 53:24.040]  Let me know if you can find that.
[53:24.400 --> 53:27.280]  There was a whole bunch of classic falls that Bernie and I used to fuckin' love
[53:27.280 --> 53:29.200]  from this old TV show called Hardcore TV.
[53:29.480 --> 53:31.020]  That had like a mod or a shot on it.
[53:31.080 --> 53:32.500]  And they're all off the internet now.
[53:32.880 --> 53:34.480]  And it's like, a lot of the internet just went away.
[53:34.480 --> 53:35.640]  So many great videos.
[53:36.560 --> 53:38.240]  Well, there you have it.
[53:38.440 --> 53:39.380]  There's our...
[53:39.380 --> 53:39.980]  Phenomenal.
[53:39.980 --> 53:40.520]  There's our time.
[53:42.020 --> 53:42.760]  Anything else?
[53:42.900 --> 53:44.300]  Any parting words about our falls?
[53:44.660 --> 53:46.380]  People are going to be able to...
[53:46.380 --> 53:47.200]  Oh, that's right.
[53:47.540 --> 53:49.300]  We have to see what the comment leavers think.
[53:49.580 --> 53:51.320]  Who they think the best draft is.
[53:51.420 --> 53:52.820]  We'll put these out.
[53:53.500 --> 53:55.020]  Who's mentioned in an episode or something?
[53:55.140 --> 53:55.560]  Yeah, yeah.
[53:56.260 --> 53:57.640]  So we're just gonna have...
[53:57.640 --> 53:59.740]  This is an audio thing, and they can just click links?
[53:59.840 --> 54:00.020]  Yeah.
[54:00.200 --> 54:00.380]  Okay.
[54:01.320 --> 54:01.940]  That'll be it.
[54:02.120 --> 54:03.460]  And I think...
[54:03.460 --> 54:05.020]  I need to make that work on a phone somehow.
[54:05.340 --> 54:09.880]  First off, it's always exciting when a new, unproven idea goes off without a hitch
[54:09.880 --> 54:10.860]  and has no...
[54:11.240 --> 54:11.600]  Confusion.
[54:11.720 --> 54:12.580]  Confusion or difficulties.
[54:12.620 --> 54:14.040]  It just works as intended.
[54:14.200 --> 54:14.420]  Yeah.
[54:14.440 --> 54:14.920]  Out of the gate.
[54:15.140 --> 54:15.840]  So that's...
[54:16.600 --> 54:17.560]  You know, affirming.
[54:18.820 --> 54:22.560]  I feel like, you know, when Andrew and I were talking about this initially, we were saying
[54:22.560 --> 54:25.160]  that maybe this could become a fall thing, like we do the fall falls.
[54:25.400 --> 54:25.820]  Oh, that's fine.
[54:25.840 --> 54:26.400]  And like a big event.
[54:26.620 --> 54:31.200]  But I feel like the snake draft works so well, as we all knew it would, that we should do
[54:31.200 --> 54:32.520]  this for other kinds of videos.
[54:32.780 --> 54:32.920]  Yeah.
[54:33.100 --> 54:36.420]  Like this could be kind of like a recurring segment where next time we do, I don't know,
[54:37.040 --> 54:40.560]  people throwing up or getting their legs cut off or whatever.
[54:41.020 --> 54:41.700]  Oh, God.
[54:42.220 --> 54:42.620]  People...
[54:42.620 --> 54:43.360]  Getting their legs...
[54:43.360 --> 54:46.760]  You want a draft of people getting their legs cut off?
[54:46.800 --> 54:47.220]  Probably not.
[54:47.320 --> 54:49.100]  But just throwing out there weird things that happen.
[54:49.340 --> 54:50.140]  Definitely not.
[54:50.300 --> 54:51.480]  Maybe car oopsies.
[54:51.740 --> 54:51.940]  Who knows?
[54:52.140 --> 54:53.100]  Oh, car oopsies are good.
[54:53.400 --> 54:54.200]  That's some great car oopsies.
[54:54.200 --> 54:54.600]  I'm on board with it.
[54:54.760 --> 54:54.880]  Yeah.
[54:55.740 --> 54:56.140]  Okay.
[54:56.280 --> 54:57.080]  So let us know.
[54:57.420 --> 54:58.960]  You can tweet at us at F***FacePod.
[54:59.140 --> 55:00.000]  You can check out on Instagram.
[55:00.200 --> 55:03.260]  I'm sure we'll have some selects from clips and things like that.
[55:04.400 --> 55:10.000]  But we'll have, I mean, really, it's up to you guys who had the best fall draft.
[55:10.080 --> 55:10.420]  It was Nick.
[55:11.480 --> 55:12.900]  That mascot one is really...
[55:12.900 --> 55:13.480]  I think Nick has a strong point.
[55:13.480 --> 55:14.380]  Boy, that's a good one.
[55:14.380 --> 55:14.940]  That sofa too.
[55:15.380 --> 55:16.600]  It's gonna be hard to beat Nick.
[55:17.360 --> 55:18.040]  Nick's great.
[55:18.380 --> 55:19.420]  Not as influential as the audience, but...
[55:19.420 --> 55:20.640]  I think that's it.
[55:21.200 --> 55:21.720]  Thank you.
[55:21.820 --> 55:22.420]  Any wise words?
[55:22.520 --> 55:23.220]  Any parting words?
[55:23.460 --> 55:23.600]  Anything?
[55:24.120 --> 55:25.900]  I'm glad we all understood how this would go.
[55:27.060 --> 55:28.240]  I think it went great.
[55:28.440 --> 55:28.800]  Textbook.
[55:30.120 --> 55:30.520]  Cut.
[55:33.260 --> 55:34.380]  Cut.
