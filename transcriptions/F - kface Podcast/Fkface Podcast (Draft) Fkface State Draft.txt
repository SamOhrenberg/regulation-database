[00:10.150 --> 00:14.470]  Hello and welcome to another F*** Face Brand Draft.
[00:14.630 --> 00:17.530]  That's right, it's your favorite piece of supplemental content.
[00:17.710 --> 00:22.710]  Or, maybe it's not. Either way, it does exist and it's happening right now.
[00:23.150 --> 00:25.390]  Today we're going to do Eric's idea.
[00:25.570 --> 00:30.970]  Eric wanted to do a draft of the 50 states. The 50 U.S. states.
[00:31.510 --> 00:35.370]  It's going to be interesting to get the perspective of Andrew and...
[00:35.370 --> 00:39.950]  I knew, as soon as we started, I knew it was going to be...
[00:39.950 --> 00:41.910]  I talked to my wife about this.
[00:42.270 --> 00:47.850]  How is Andrew going to not draft the 50 states of the United States?
[00:48.010 --> 00:50.690]  It's a states draft. There was never any mention of...
[00:50.690 --> 00:56.790]  So, like I said, what I was hoping for was that we were going to see...
[00:57.830 --> 00:59.470]  Geoff, didn't I tell you this in the car?
[00:59.890 --> 01:00.790]  I believe you did.
[01:01.130 --> 01:03.230]  I said, what do you think Andrew's going to do?
[01:03.230 --> 01:07.190]  So, what I was hoping for is that we had a draft with a pool.
[01:08.330 --> 01:10.390]  Where I would pick something, you would pick something.
[01:10.430 --> 01:13.130]  You'd be like, oh man, you picked this thing, I picked that thing.
[01:14.010 --> 01:15.970]  A finite draft pool, you mean?
[01:15.970 --> 01:16.370]  Correct.
[01:16.410 --> 01:17.570]  What a novel concept.
[01:17.970 --> 01:20.890]  And then, Geoff, what's happening now?
[01:21.550 --> 01:26.290]  Now I think Andrew's opening it up to states of being and emotional states...
[01:26.290 --> 01:28.330]  and all kinds of other things that include the word state.
[01:28.450 --> 01:31.950]  Well, it has always been pitched as a states draft.
[01:31.950 --> 01:34.990]  There was never any specific U.S. mention.
[01:35.170 --> 01:39.830]  I told you, I told you what was going to happen.
[01:41.050 --> 01:43.590]  Hang on, let's see what Eric originally wrote.
[01:44.270 --> 01:49.110]  In the original text, states draft, we've talked state songs, think on it.
[01:50.730 --> 01:52.730]  And then, is there more to the conversation?
[01:53.370 --> 01:56.630]  Geoff says, I do like the idea where the pool isn't everything ever.
[01:58.310 --> 02:00.390]  I just took that as an unnecessary dig.
[02:00.390 --> 02:05.030]  So I perceive that comment as a rule.
[02:05.510 --> 02:12.630]  So, what we were hoping for was that it was just going to be states of the union.
[02:13.870 --> 02:16.130]  Well, there's no union, it was just states, but okay.
[02:18.110 --> 02:22.070]  I have my states ready, okay, and I'll put them up against any of your fancy states.
[02:22.350 --> 02:23.730]  See, this is what... of course.
[02:24.090 --> 02:27.470]  So the way this works is we do a snake draft.
[02:27.590 --> 02:28.630]  Why do we do a snake draft?
[02:28.630 --> 02:30.910]  You'd have to ask Andrew, but he won't give you a real answer.
[02:31.970 --> 02:33.650]  The way that works, and we're going to do...
[02:34.630 --> 02:38.050]  In order of first, we do... typically we run with Agnag.
[02:38.150 --> 02:41.990]  But for these drafts specifically, we go through a randomizer.org.
[02:42.910 --> 02:45.490]  Eric is going to randomize it a certain number of times.
[02:45.930 --> 02:47.890]  What's the number for this draft?
[02:48.510 --> 02:48.910]  Seven?
[02:49.790 --> 02:50.790]  Is it seven?
[02:51.410 --> 02:52.130]  I'm fine with that.
[02:52.210 --> 02:52.750]  Seven okay with everybody?
[02:53.530 --> 02:54.270]  Let's do it at seven.
[02:54.770 --> 02:55.070]  Okay.
[02:56.510 --> 02:58.110]  I'm going to list from our last order.
[02:58.110 --> 02:59.830]  That's what our jumping off point will be.
[03:01.150 --> 03:03.290]  We're going to randomize this seven times.
[03:03.630 --> 03:05.430]  The first order without randomizing.
[03:05.750 --> 03:06.670]  This is the way they're input.
[03:07.330 --> 03:09.350]  Andrew, Geoff, Gavin, Eric, Nick.
[03:09.470 --> 03:10.670]  One randomized. Here it is.
[03:12.170 --> 03:14.790]  Nick, Geoff, Gavin, Andrew, Eric.
[03:15.850 --> 03:16.350]  Number two.
[03:17.370 --> 03:19.630]  Eric, Gavin, Geoff, Andrew, Nick.
[03:19.990 --> 03:20.330]  Egan.
[03:21.130 --> 03:22.350]  Great. Number three.
[03:23.370 --> 03:25.750]  Geoff, Gavin, Nick, Andrew, Eric.
[03:26.270 --> 03:27.330]  We've seen that one before.
[03:27.950 --> 03:30.970]  Eric, Andrew, Nick, Gavin, Geoff.
[03:32.490 --> 03:33.470]  Here's five.
[03:34.650 --> 03:36.950]  Eric, Gavin, Geoff, Andrew, Nick.
[03:37.310 --> 03:37.870]  Egan again?
[03:39.990 --> 03:41.110]  Here's six.
[03:42.090 --> 03:44.350]  Nick, Gavin, Geoff, Eric, Andrew.
[03:44.510 --> 03:45.310]  And number seven.
[03:45.530 --> 03:47.470]  This will be our draft order.
[03:49.390 --> 03:49.950]  Andrew.
[03:50.430 --> 03:51.090]  An egg!
[03:52.090 --> 03:53.510]  An egg!
[03:53.590 --> 03:55.410]  Oh my god, we got an egg!
[03:55.410 --> 03:57.370]  I cannot believe it.
[03:57.490 --> 03:58.030]  Wow!
[03:59.350 --> 04:01.970]  I've won the draft three times in a row!
[04:02.870 --> 04:04.750]  Truly an unlucky number.
[04:05.490 --> 04:08.090]  Do you guys want me to share?
[04:08.670 --> 04:09.190]  Yes.
[04:09.570 --> 04:10.230]  No, I don't know.
[04:10.570 --> 04:10.870]  What?
[04:11.230 --> 04:13.550]  You can put your own in, I guess.
[04:14.090 --> 04:15.510]  I don't have to share my screen anymore.
[04:15.670 --> 04:17.730]  There is the draft list.
[04:17.870 --> 04:18.870]  You should have it now.
[04:19.730 --> 04:21.830]  I think it's good to have a visual reference.
[04:22.150 --> 04:23.110]  Yeah, just in case.
[04:23.790 --> 04:24.350]  Definitely.
[04:25.710 --> 04:30.550]  Okay, well, originally this was supposed to be for just the 50 states of the Union.
[04:30.770 --> 04:34.710]  As I went on to say, this will be great, because we're going to end up picking 20 states,
[04:34.770 --> 04:39.410]  and there will be 30 that aren't picked, making the 50, which are the states of the Union.
[04:40.030 --> 04:44.870]  However, Andrew is going to pick, like, Nirvana, or whatever.
[04:45.230 --> 04:46.610]  And that will be what we are doing here.
[04:46.770 --> 04:53.210]  So, Andrew, you can lead us off, because you're the first pick in the f***face states draft.
[04:53.210 --> 04:55.650]  Now, this is a really important pick.
[04:55.890 --> 05:00.170]  This is an important draft for me, because I was the one that brought the drafts to the table.
[05:00.590 --> 05:02.430]  I really like my performance in the last draft.
[05:02.550 --> 05:06.610]  I don't know if I like my performance overall, but I've learned some things.
[05:07.070 --> 05:08.850]  I've learned some things during this process.
[05:10.130 --> 05:18.330]  I think it's really important to have a winner's mentality, an empire state of mind, some might say.
[05:18.330 --> 05:19.690]  Are you padding for time right now?
[05:19.970 --> 05:21.350]  No, I'm just explaining my pick.
[05:21.890 --> 05:22.570]  What's wrong?
[05:22.570 --> 05:24.050]  I'm not allowed to explain my pick?
[05:24.210 --> 05:25.370]  What do you want me to go up and f***ing say?
[05:25.370 --> 05:28.970]  Did you lose some paperwork on the desk or something, and you're just trying to find it?
[05:29.010 --> 05:30.190]  And so you're just vamping until you get there?
[05:30.190 --> 05:31.810]  No! No, I'm just, I'm getting there.
[05:32.170 --> 05:33.370]  Listen, he said his pick.
[05:33.670 --> 05:34.610]  I'm explaining the pick.
[05:34.910 --> 05:35.450]  Okay, please.
[05:35.550 --> 05:38.210]  That's very rude. That's not an empire state of mind mindset.
[05:38.370 --> 05:39.550]  You're not legit, that's very rude.
[05:39.870 --> 05:41.990]  So, I'm taking empire state of mind.
[05:42.450 --> 05:42.610]  Yeah.
[05:43.390 --> 05:44.550]  There's several references.
[05:44.550 --> 05:46.010]  He keeps saying that specifically.
[05:46.590 --> 05:46.730]  Yeah.
[05:47.010 --> 05:48.530]  So, this is so f***ed.
[05:48.570 --> 05:50.410]  I'm drafting empire state of mind.
[05:50.410 --> 05:52.810]  It's a good perspective to have.
[05:53.430 --> 05:56.590]  What I've learned on these drafts is people love crack.
[05:56.990 --> 05:59.350]  I believe Jay-Z was in that world at one time.
[05:59.490 --> 06:00.150]  He's changed.
[06:00.530 --> 06:01.230]  He's elevated.
[06:01.790 --> 06:04.630]  He's now living his best life on a jet ski.
[06:05.770 --> 06:08.770]  If this is what an empire state of mind looks like, I want it.
[06:08.810 --> 06:13.410]  So, I'm taking empire state of mind as the number one state.
[06:14.050 --> 06:14.830]  Love it.
[06:15.350 --> 06:15.690]  Great.
[06:16.270 --> 06:19.470]  Jay-Z on a jet ski looks like Gus all the time.
[06:21.450 --> 06:22.750]  Gus on his little bike.
[06:22.910 --> 06:23.390]  Yeah.
[06:24.570 --> 06:25.430]  That's pretty good.
[06:25.970 --> 06:26.710]  That's very funny.
[06:27.810 --> 06:30.870]  Okay, empire state of mind as the first pick.
[06:31.290 --> 06:31.930]  And, uh...
[06:31.930 --> 06:32.450]  Eric Thors.
[06:33.030 --> 06:38.790]  Yeah, not... I mean, close to what I was hoping for, but close is no cigar, I suppose.
[06:40.130 --> 06:44.010]  Nick, you have the second pick in the first round.
[06:44.350 --> 06:48.590]  Well, Eric, I might make you happy with this one because it's an actual state in the Union.
[06:48.590 --> 06:53.230]  And it's home to one of my favorite cities in the world.
[06:53.670 --> 06:56.860]  Beautiful Pacific Northwest area, Mount Rainier.
[06:57.450 --> 07:00.010]  I'm going with the state of Washington.
[07:00.750 --> 07:02.770]  Washington. That's a good one.
[07:03.310 --> 07:05.190]  I love that state.
[07:05.630 --> 07:06.010]  Okay.
[07:06.490 --> 07:09.610]  So, the first pick was empire state of mind.
[07:09.810 --> 07:11.750]  And the second pick is Washington.
[07:11.810 --> 07:12.190]  Washington.
[07:13.170 --> 07:16.910]  I think empire state of mind is a little better than Washington, personally.
[07:16.910 --> 07:22.970]  I've been to Washington. I would take empire state of mind over Washington any day of the week.
[07:23.450 --> 07:25.110]  Okay. Okay.
[07:25.730 --> 07:27.370]  This is going to be a weird draft.
[07:27.570 --> 07:30.370]  My pick, I'm the third pick in the first round.
[07:30.610 --> 07:32.710]  Very easy for me. No hesitation.
[07:32.930 --> 07:34.150]  This should have been a number one.
[07:35.070 --> 07:36.730]  California. Best state in the Union.
[07:37.350 --> 07:38.410]  Biggest state in the Union.
[07:39.350 --> 07:42.530]  I think it's like the number seven GDP in the world.
[07:42.830 --> 07:44.270]  Number five. It's number five.
[07:45.470 --> 07:45.910]  What?
[07:45.910 --> 07:47.810]  It's number five GDP in the world.
[07:47.910 --> 07:49.670]  Knew that right off hand.
[07:50.170 --> 07:51.150]  Great. Anyway.
[07:52.470 --> 07:54.130]  California is my state.
[07:54.390 --> 07:56.870]  And that will be my pick in the first round.
[07:57.170 --> 07:57.790]  Best state.
[07:58.210 --> 07:58.450]  Geoff.
[07:58.810 --> 08:00.150]  A bit fiery though, isn't it?
[08:00.970 --> 08:02.290]  A bit fiery?
[08:02.730 --> 08:03.690]  It's got a lot of water.
[08:04.090 --> 08:05.110]  It has a lot of water.
[08:05.670 --> 08:07.210]  It also has a lot of mountains and a lot of snow.
[08:07.750 --> 08:08.350]  Some baggage.
[08:08.950 --> 08:10.330]  Some baggage to that state, for sure.
[08:10.570 --> 08:11.990]  Every state has baggage, dude.
[08:12.550 --> 08:13.690]  No, it doesn't.
[08:14.250 --> 08:14.710]  What?
[08:14.710 --> 08:15.990]  Empire State of Mind?
[08:16.190 --> 08:16.790]  Empire State of Mind?
[08:16.990 --> 08:17.150]  Yeah.
[08:20.450 --> 08:25.830]  So, I was excited about the spirit of this draft because we're using a finite pool.
[08:26.030 --> 08:31.290]  As I said earlier, it's nice to do a draft that's not pulling from everything, from all times.
[08:32.330 --> 08:35.350]  And so, I was thinking about, like, I'm into drafting.
[08:35.530 --> 08:38.750]  I just went through the, obviously, the NBA draft.
[08:39.030 --> 08:39.750]  It's a big deal to me.
[08:39.830 --> 08:41.050]  One of the biggest deals of the year.
[08:41.630 --> 08:45.810]  And so, I was thinking about, like, how you approach a draft, how you look at power rankings.
[08:46.230 --> 08:49.170]  You know, the preeminent power rankings are NBA.com.
[08:49.330 --> 08:54.090]  That's kind of how you determine who, how people are going to go in the draft.
[08:54.430 --> 08:58.450]  And so, I thought, who's, like, the preeminent, like, power ranker of states?
[08:58.690 --> 09:02.830]  So, I went with U.S. News & World Report's 2023 listing.
[09:03.270 --> 09:07.910]  According to U.S. News & World Report's, the number one overall state.
[09:08.050 --> 09:08.590]  Yes, I'm bamping.
[09:08.590 --> 09:12.170]  The number one overall state in America is Utah.
[09:12.370 --> 09:16.210]  It comes in at 84,898 square miles.
[09:16.350 --> 09:18.950]  It has a GDP of $248 billion.
[09:19.090 --> 09:22.950]  46.3% of Utahns are college educated.
[09:23.070 --> 09:27.210]  It has a population, statewide population of 3,380,800.
[09:27.590 --> 09:28.850]  The capital is Salt Lake City.
[09:28.950 --> 09:32.430]  The median income is $37,325.
[09:32.430 --> 09:38.610]  It is listed as number 15 in crime and corrections.
[09:38.850 --> 09:40.030]  It's number one in economy, somehow.
[09:40.350 --> 09:41.590]  Number five in education.
[09:42.010 --> 09:44.230]  Number one in fiscal stability, which is important.
[09:44.370 --> 09:47.010]  Number seven in healthcare, which out of 50 ain't too bad.
[09:47.110 --> 09:48.430]  Number four in infrastructure.
[09:48.570 --> 09:50.450]  Not great in natural environment.
[09:50.610 --> 09:51.370]  You would think it'd be better.
[09:51.470 --> 09:52.290]  It's 46 there.
[09:52.470 --> 09:55.230]  But number 20 in opportunity, and we all love opportunity.
[09:57.050 --> 09:59.370]  What is... what the...
[09:59.370 --> 10:00.270]  That's a lot of data.
[10:00.810 --> 10:01.250]  Utah.
[10:01.250 --> 10:01.470]  Utah.
[10:01.570 --> 10:02.770]  Well, I like to be scientific.
[10:03.190 --> 10:03.870]  You know?
[10:04.790 --> 10:08.670]  As you said, I don't want to go with deep cuts when I'm building my basketball team.
[10:08.830 --> 10:11.670]  I want to go with the best available players.
[10:11.950 --> 10:14.350]  And so Utah is number one in the power rankings.
[10:15.010 --> 10:17.850]  Gavin, do you have any thoughts on the picks so far?
[10:18.450 --> 10:19.110]  Pretty solid.
[10:20.770 --> 10:21.530]  Good picks.
[10:21.910 --> 10:24.170]  Did you see Utah going first round?
[10:24.750 --> 10:26.090]  Is that the Mormon place?
[10:26.510 --> 10:27.190]  Yes, it is.
[10:27.610 --> 10:27.750]  Okay.
[10:27.750 --> 10:31.970]  It should really tell you something if that's how you identify it.
[10:34.010 --> 10:36.390]  Yeah, it's like Salt Flats and Mormons, isn't it?
[10:36.570 --> 10:36.750]  Yeah.
[10:37.190 --> 10:39.250]  That's about it.
[10:39.590 --> 10:40.590]  Number seven in healthcare.
[10:42.430 --> 10:43.770]  Number four in infrastructure.
[10:44.010 --> 10:45.530]  Number one in fiscal stability.
[10:45.970 --> 10:48.650]  Don't underestimate the importance of fiscal stability.
[10:51.030 --> 10:51.550]  Okay.
[10:52.090 --> 10:53.690]  Is the salt... can you use the salt?
[10:53.790 --> 10:54.510]  Is it like salt?
[10:55.210 --> 10:55.750]  It is salt.
[10:55.790 --> 10:55.870]  What?
[10:55.870 --> 10:58.910]  Like you can just grab a handful of it and put it on your chips?
[11:00.990 --> 11:02.210]  What are you doing?
[11:02.490 --> 11:03.250]  Okay, never mind.
[11:03.530 --> 11:03.870]  Never mind.
[11:04.170 --> 11:04.590]  Cultural thing.
[11:05.210 --> 11:06.350]  I was thinking potato chips.
[11:06.490 --> 11:07.550]  When you said chips, you mean fries.
[11:07.630 --> 11:08.010]  That's not me.
[11:08.190 --> 11:08.550]  That's not me.
[11:08.730 --> 11:09.730]  It took me a while to translate.
[11:11.070 --> 11:14.170]  Just imagining sitting down with a bag of chips, throwing more salt in.
[11:14.210 --> 11:14.890]  You can't put salt on them.
[11:15.490 --> 11:18.110]  Because in my experience, there's two salts, right?
[11:18.250 --> 11:19.990]  There's salt, like table salt.
[11:20.290 --> 11:23.590]  And there's Himalayan, for some reason, pink salt.
[11:23.590 --> 11:26.310]  But you don't ever hear about Utah.
[11:26.310 --> 11:27.810]  Isn't it the same? Isn't it just fancier?
[11:28.010 --> 11:29.170]  It's just fancier salt, right?
[11:29.530 --> 11:30.310]  I don't know how that works.
[11:31.030 --> 11:31.930]  I think it's just fancy salt.
[11:32.350 --> 11:33.890]  Maybe we should do a salt draft.
[11:34.410 --> 11:35.330]  I don't think so.
[11:36.590 --> 11:36.970]  I agree.
[11:37.590 --> 11:38.230]  Should I do my pick?
[11:38.570 --> 11:41.610]  I've got some black, like Hawaiian salt that's pretty good.
[11:42.530 --> 11:45.010]  It comes from up near the volcanoes.
[11:46.470 --> 11:47.550]  I bought it when I was there.
[11:48.470 --> 11:51.830]  It'd be my first round pick in the salt draft.
[11:53.650 --> 11:54.170]  Montana.
[11:58.290 --> 12:00.050]  That's your first round pick?
[12:00.310 --> 12:01.670]  There are some things I like about it.
[12:02.250 --> 12:06.810]  It's one of the few states I've never been to, so I don't know a lot about it.
[12:07.770 --> 12:13.310]  I read that it has seven people per square mile, which is nice, pretty peaceful, pretty quiet.
[12:14.350 --> 12:17.550]  I've heard the sky is bigger there than other states.
[12:17.550 --> 12:25.030]  I've also noticed that on the map, the shape of it is like if the bottom left corner of your fish tank exploded.
[12:26.310 --> 12:29.230]  Those are my reasons for enjoying the state of Montana.
[12:29.550 --> 12:33.450]  Have you never thought about how it looks like a person's face?
[12:34.130 --> 12:35.350]  It's a person's face?
[12:35.610 --> 12:38.410]  No, I mean like if you look at Montana.
[12:39.190 --> 12:41.690]  You said it looks like your fish tank exploded.
[12:42.330 --> 12:43.590]  You don't think that looks like a person's face?
[12:43.590 --> 12:44.510]  Oh, yeah, I see it.
[12:44.550 --> 12:47.010]  Oh, like he's got a little schlongy little nose?
[12:47.250 --> 12:47.570]  Yeah.
[12:48.170 --> 12:48.910]  Kinda looks like you.
[12:49.370 --> 12:50.990]  Oh, I wonder what...
[12:50.990 --> 12:51.730]  Yeah, get him.
[12:52.930 --> 12:55.290]  Yeah, it looks like Montana's looking at Idaho.
[12:56.090 --> 12:59.690]  Yes, that looks like a nose that can't get in a fish tank is what that nose looks like.
[13:00.270 --> 13:04.410]  You know, I'd be interested in looking at property in the tip of the nose of Montana.
[13:05.970 --> 13:10.110]  It looks like it's judging the state like diagonal to it, bottom left.
[13:10.190 --> 13:12.230]  Like it's looking at it. It's checking it out.
[13:12.230 --> 13:14.970]  It's making sure nothing bad's going on down there.
[13:15.350 --> 13:17.230]  You've never been to Montana?
[13:18.970 --> 13:22.050]  No, I've been to 29 states, apparently, but never Montana.
[13:23.250 --> 13:24.230]  He's missing out.
[13:24.970 --> 13:25.410]  Good shit?
[13:26.230 --> 13:26.370]  Yeah.
[13:26.570 --> 13:29.490]  Good one. Well, it's a snake draft, so you get the first pick in our second round.
[13:30.250 --> 13:30.510]  Okay.
[13:32.250 --> 13:33.010]  Next state.
[13:34.390 --> 13:34.830]  Liquid.
[13:36.910 --> 13:40.730]  Of the different states of matter, I'd say liquid is the most interesting.
[13:41.490 --> 13:45.870]  Typically, if you look out of a window, you're going to be looking at gas and solid.
[13:46.410 --> 13:51.330]  But unless you're at the beach or unless you're somewhere of interest, you're not seeing water.
[13:51.690 --> 13:55.170]  Water is the most interesting state of matter, in my opinion.
[13:55.690 --> 13:57.810]  As a water guy, I think this is a great pick.
[13:58.470 --> 14:02.150]  Honestly, I may have taken it in the first round and went Montana in the second.
[14:02.790 --> 14:03.630]  But it's a great pick.
[14:06.310 --> 14:08.450]  Geoff, you have any thoughts on liquid?
[14:09.830 --> 14:14.390]  I'm a big fan of it. I drink liquid all day, every day, so I can't...
[14:14.390 --> 14:18.210]  I mean, if I was choosing actually between liquid or Montana, I would go for liquid.
[14:19.110 --> 14:19.970]  For sure, it's Montana.
[14:20.410 --> 14:23.310]  Yeah, you chose Montana, though, you dumbass.
[14:23.590 --> 14:25.030]  Well, Montana has liquid in it.
[14:25.510 --> 14:26.170]  That's true.
[14:26.470 --> 14:28.450]  Fair enough. Does liquid have Montana in it?
[14:28.570 --> 14:29.510]  Yeah, that's a great question.
[14:31.730 --> 14:32.770]  I don't think so.
[14:33.890 --> 14:34.970]  Alright, who's next?
[14:36.510 --> 14:37.210]  Oh, it's me?
[14:37.210 --> 14:37.830]  Yeah.
[14:37.930 --> 14:42.450]  Okay, according to U.S. News & World Report, the number 3 best overall state...
[14:42.450 --> 14:44.910]  I couldn't pick number 2, that was Washington, Nick took that pick.
[14:45.290 --> 14:48.690]  It comes in at number 9 in... let's see if you can guess what it is.
[14:48.870 --> 14:56.150]  It comes in at number 9 in crimes and corrections, number 2 in economy, number 2 in fiscal stability, number 10 in infrastructure, number 19 in opportunity.
[14:56.230 --> 15:00.590]  We discussed opportunity, it's something that everybody wants, and I'll say it, everybody deserves.
[15:00.590 --> 15:02.190]  Number 14 in healthcare.
[15:03.790 --> 15:10.890]  Interestingly enough, at New Year's Eve every year, I thought I'd throw some more interesting data in there.
[15:11.210 --> 15:17.310]  They do a giant potato drop to ring in the New Year, kind of like in New York Times, they have the ball drop.
[15:17.390 --> 15:26.950]  Well, here they do the giant potato drop, and everybody crowds around because the potato is the state vegetable, state fruit's the huckleberry.
[15:26.950 --> 15:31.430]  Obviously, I'm talking about the number 3 overall best state in America.
[15:31.790 --> 15:36.650]  According to U.S. News and World Report, number 23 in national environment, I am talking about Idaho.
[15:37.230 --> 15:39.210]  Oh, that was on my list.
[15:40.090 --> 15:44.530]  Wow, see what happens when we have a draft with a pool that's not infinite?
[15:45.250 --> 15:46.850]  I'm going to have to come up with someone else.
[15:47.450 --> 15:51.850]  It's bordered by Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Montana, and Wyoming.
[15:52.170 --> 15:56.110]  Those are all places you could visit easily from your state of Idaho.
[15:56.110 --> 16:02.350]  See, Gavin, and that's the point of the draft and why we do it this way, where it is going to block other people's picks, and then you have to think on your feet.
[16:02.350 --> 16:03.810]  Didn't we have a blocked pick?
[16:04.050 --> 16:08.130]  I already had that with rock candy, it's true.
[16:09.050 --> 16:12.990]  Oh, that's right, I forgot about rock candy.
[16:13.490 --> 16:15.490]  That's okay, Nick can just cut that part out of this and nobody knows.
[16:17.770 --> 16:19.490]  Yeah, wouldn't want to make me look foolish.
[16:19.690 --> 16:20.110]  There you go.
[16:21.450 --> 16:22.590]  Geoff, have you been to Idaho?
[16:23.410 --> 16:25.650]  I've been to almost all the states, so yes.
[16:25.650 --> 16:28.010]  Okay, so that's almost an answer to my question.
[16:28.230 --> 16:32.770]  I've been to Boise, Idaho, I've been to Twin Falls, Idaho, I drove through it.
[16:32.770 --> 16:39.250]  I've been down to, what is it, where the Snake River is, where they crossed in Oregon Trail, I went down that.
[16:39.690 --> 16:42.350]  I know Idaho, I know Idaho.
[16:42.930 --> 16:46.790]  And there's another thing about Idaho, potatoes are in almost everything.
[16:47.030 --> 16:48.910]  Everybody loves potatoes, except for my fiancé.
[16:49.210 --> 16:54.270]  Potatoes are like the fucking glue that keeps America together, and Idaho is where the potatoes are.
[16:54.270 --> 16:55.590]  It's very important.
[16:56.250 --> 17:00.370]  She doesn't like potatoes, no. She thinks mashed potatoes are the grossest thing ever.
[17:00.390 --> 17:01.790]  In any format, though?
[17:02.470 --> 17:05.710]  She likes certain french fries, but that's it, man.
[17:05.890 --> 17:10.030]  She won't, hash browns, baked potato, none of that shit, she doesn't want it.
[17:10.090 --> 17:12.070]  She does not like the texture of a potato.
[17:12.490 --> 17:16.090]  What was the style of potato that Chad used to make and bring over?
[17:16.950 --> 17:18.890]  Oh, grotten potatoes, she doesn't like those, yeah.
[17:18.930 --> 17:19.810]  Oh, they're so good.
[17:20.170 --> 17:20.870]  Yeah, no kidding.
[17:21.410 --> 17:23.470]  Wow, so what are you going to do?
[17:23.670 --> 17:27.190]  I'll tell you what I'm not going to do, I'm not going to move to Idaho with her.
[17:27.570 --> 17:29.970]  There you go, I guess that's what I was thinking.
[17:31.070 --> 17:34.110]  Okay, I have the next pick in the second round.
[17:34.950 --> 17:39.470]  I'm going to take this one based purely on the people.
[17:40.510 --> 17:46.570]  Great, real blue collar, nose to the grindstone people, classic weirdos with great accents.
[17:47.410 --> 17:51.390]  My second pick is Pennsylvania.
[17:51.970 --> 18:00.650]  It is the way that they say water ice and the way that accent is so funny.
[18:01.350 --> 18:06.950]  A yin's going to the eagles game, the way they talk, fantastic.
[18:07.310 --> 18:12.870]  Thank you so much for being an insane place that if you're from, you don't leave.
[18:12.870 --> 18:19.750]  So it just gets this inbreeding of accent that never, ever, ever, ever goes away.
[18:20.130 --> 18:22.690]  And that truly is a great state.
[18:23.430 --> 18:26.910]  Gritty is there, the Philly fanatic is there.
[18:27.210 --> 18:28.990]  They're probably related somehow.
[18:29.510 --> 18:33.530]  Pennsylvania, we salute you and you are my second round pick.
[18:33.830 --> 18:34.770]  Thanks for cheese steaks.
[18:35.470 --> 18:36.670]  Hey, there you go.
[18:36.790 --> 18:38.590]  See, a little bit of something for everyone.
[18:39.170 --> 18:39.830]  Nick, thoughts?
[18:40.410 --> 18:42.250]  I love that state. Good pick.
[18:42.390 --> 18:46.090]  I thought I'd take it out from under Nick.
[18:46.170 --> 18:48.590]  You really did, home of the Philadelphia Phillies, and now I'm really hurt.
[18:50.210 --> 18:53.030]  And when I take over Pennsylvania, they're dissolved as a team.
[18:56.870 --> 19:00.070]  That's rough. Mike Schmidt's rolling over in his grave. He's probably still alive.
[19:01.270 --> 19:03.250]  I'm going to take this draft out from under you, Eric.
[19:03.990 --> 19:06.070]  Nick, you're the next pick.
[19:06.070 --> 19:08.530]  Alright, triple X stated the union.
[19:09.290 --> 19:10.830]  Oh, that was on my list.
[19:10.930 --> 19:11.390]  Is next.
[19:13.610 --> 19:18.950]  That's for you. I was going to go with states all the way through, and then you stole Pennsylvania.
[19:19.310 --> 19:19.890]  This sucks.
[19:22.010 --> 19:25.190]  Ice Cube replaces Xander Cage in this one.
[19:27.070 --> 19:35.770]  And they allegedly kill him off until he comes back in the sequel, but, you know, fun little 2005 movie that some people saw, I guess.
[19:36.390 --> 19:39.010]  Oh, yeah, absolutely. We can talk triple X stated the union.
[19:39.210 --> 19:44.930]  It is classic Vin Diesel, where they killed him off, or in a Vin Diesel universe, killed off a character brought back later.
[19:45.490 --> 19:52.250]  I'd maybe argue the best thing about triple X stated the union is Ice Cube's appearance in the third triple X movie as like a hero of sorts.
[19:52.330 --> 19:57.070]  He shows up in the last act for no reason with a grenade launcher. It's great. He saves the day.
[19:57.550 --> 19:59.230]  Has Nick sniped that from your list, Xander?
[19:59.650 --> 20:04.850]  It was on my list. I didn't know if it would get contentious, because it's not, it's a stated the union.
[20:04.850 --> 20:09.410]  I don't know if that would count under the thing. So I removed it. But, yeah, it was a consideration.
[20:11.750 --> 20:14.930]  Yeah, that's fair. Clearly with the spirit of the draft.
[20:15.390 --> 20:16.030]  All right, next.
[20:18.570 --> 20:25.090]  Oh, it's my pick. OK, well, we're talking U.S. states. We've talked basketball.
[20:25.810 --> 20:33.530]  I'm taking I'm taking the big state. Taking the big state, which is some people may think of Alaska.
[20:33.530 --> 20:38.610]  Fuck that. I don't want that. I don't want that baggage. I don't want to deal with that. I don't give a fuck about Alaska.
[20:39.010 --> 20:43.610]  What I'm talking about is big state in the film. He got game.
[20:43.690 --> 20:48.870]  I'm talking I'm talking Jesus Shuttlesworth. I'm talking public enemy.
[20:49.690 --> 21:00.130]  The state of big. That is the school that Denzel Washington, the beginning of the movie, he gets told that his son, he needs to try to get him to big state, which is the governor.
[21:00.130 --> 21:07.690]  The governor runs the I will think he governs and he's like, I want your son on the team that I went to school for big state.
[21:07.970 --> 21:15.310]  He organizes a prison escape. Well, not an escape, but essentially an escape just to try to get this kid on his basketball team.
[21:15.430 --> 21:20.210]  I respect that. I respect the mindset, the hustler mentality of big state.
[21:20.470 --> 21:25.470]  My second pick is big state. Do you know who Jesus Shuttleworth, who played Jesus Shuttleworth?
[21:26.470 --> 21:38.610]  I'm blanking his name, but yeah, Ray fucking Allen, NBA second greatest three point shooter of all time and greatest until Steph Curry came along, dethroned Reggie Miller.
[21:38.850 --> 21:43.370]  Yeah, it was none other than like 19 year old Ray Allen himself right as he was going into the NBA.
[21:43.890 --> 21:50.650]  Wow. So that's a literal state. I picked a U.S. state. It is fictitious, but it is the U.S. state.
[21:51.190 --> 21:57.550]  Love it. Now do I have a swing? Does it go back to me? It does.
[21:58.090 --> 22:03.790]  OK, well, I am if I am anything, I am I am a big company guy. Love the company.
[22:04.070 --> 22:08.850]  Right. And that's what we've always said. Yeah, we always talk about you, Drew. We go big company guy.
[22:09.150 --> 22:13.710]  When you think not the Rooster Teeth store, you think that is a company man right there.
[22:13.790 --> 22:16.210]  Yeah, that's yeah. And there is a slogan.
[22:16.210 --> 22:21.230]  Company has a slogan, which is just playing as we're doing here at this current time.
[22:21.270 --> 22:28.310]  We're just playing. So I am taking with my third pick first round or first pick of third round.
[22:28.610 --> 22:34.710]  I'm taking state of play. What a place to be in. It's what we do. It's about video games.
[22:34.850 --> 22:38.630]  I like to play. We're playing right now. I like to watch people play.
[22:38.630 --> 22:42.550]  I'm all about saying we're playing right now. Like you keep saying it.
[22:44.030 --> 22:51.770]  It's what we do here. State of play. My third pick. God, that's all right.
[22:52.690 --> 23:04.350]  Wait, what is that? When PlayStation does their press conferences, when they show the new games, they call it a state of play.
[23:05.070 --> 23:07.390]  I'm all about the state of play.
[23:09.770 --> 23:21.070]  The most you're giving a gap and just keep going. OK, Nick, I'll help you here.
[23:21.150 --> 23:25.410]  I'm going to get us back on track. I'm going to go with the state of Alaska.
[23:25.570 --> 23:28.270]  Thank you. Word for the state of Alaska.
[23:28.270 --> 23:31.850]  It's where I went on my honeymoon. So it holds a special place in my heart.
[23:32.730 --> 23:38.110]  And it's beautiful out there. You know, too much sun a lot of the year. Not enough sun most of the rest of the year.
[23:38.450 --> 23:43.350]  But in between, real pretty. You get that three weeks there where it's fucking great.
[23:43.850 --> 23:46.070]  You travel there then and then you leave the rest of the time.
[23:46.650 --> 23:49.170]  Yeah, who wants to be on a vacation longer than three weeks anyway? Exactly.
[23:50.110 --> 23:53.110]  Did you see some northern lights? Oh, no, I missed out on that.
[23:53.130 --> 23:56.090]  But I did get to see some cool glaciers that were probably melting.
[23:56.090 --> 24:00.190]  Oh, is that's interesting.
[24:00.390 --> 24:04.190]  What? That were probably melting.
[24:04.330 --> 24:07.330]  Well, you know, great. I think it's a safe assumption. Yeah.
[24:07.670 --> 24:08.290]  Yeah. Todd.
[24:11.270 --> 24:16.030]  Yeah, dumbass ice melts in the heat anyway.
[24:16.490 --> 24:18.450]  You're you're you're big Eric.
[24:20.330 --> 24:23.510]  It's hot. It's hot. The day's 23 hours long.
[24:24.570 --> 24:27.710]  I feel like the number one thing I hear about ice is that it's melting.
[24:27.830 --> 24:30.490]  So I think I hear about it a lot.
[24:30.590 --> 24:33.750]  I hear. And, you know, liquid was already taken as a state.
[24:33.810 --> 24:36.510]  So, yeah, too much sun.
[24:36.570 --> 24:39.630]  I will pick a true paradise.
[24:40.030 --> 24:43.790]  The last state to be ratified in the United States.
[24:44.130 --> 24:48.150]  It is Hawaii just barely inching out.
[24:48.270 --> 24:51.650]  Alaska. Alaska was ratified in June of 59.
[24:51.650 --> 24:54.450]  And Hawaii in August of 59.
[24:54.610 --> 24:58.430]  So within a one year span, those are our two final states.
[24:58.770 --> 25:06.270]  Hawaii. We'll say the opposite of Alaska in terms of the amount of sun and not sun, I guess.
[25:06.950 --> 25:08.490]  Very important to people.
[25:09.570 --> 25:11.070]  No ice. It is.
[25:12.110 --> 25:14.230]  It's a it's a great state.
[25:14.670 --> 25:18.110]  It's mostly a state. So that way we had a stopover.
[25:18.910 --> 25:20.430]  On the way to Japan.
[25:21.870 --> 25:27.430]  Case of, you know, any kind of foul play or fighting.
[25:28.130 --> 25:30.430]  However, it is a state in the union.
[25:30.950 --> 25:36.670]  So I will be I will be choosing Hawaii, a state where I proposed to my small wife.
[25:36.710 --> 25:40.990]  Oh, and there you go. That is my third pick.
[25:41.130 --> 25:43.810]  Very nice. As we go into Geoff.
[25:44.230 --> 25:45.050]  Making it personal.
[25:45.610 --> 25:46.870]  Yeah, it's a nice touch.
[25:46.870 --> 25:51.050]  This pick is not as personal as Eric's pick, but I do I do.
[25:51.230 --> 25:52.970]  I have some personal feelings about it.
[25:53.190 --> 26:01.670]  Did you guys know? Were you guys aware that Americans consume 68 billion cups of popcorn every year?
[26:01.730 --> 26:06.950]  That's enough popcorn to fill the Empire State Building 18 times.
[26:07.570 --> 26:14.630]  And this state produces more than 25 percent of the entire country's popcorn supply.
[26:14.630 --> 26:18.390]  Clearly, I'm talking about the number 26 state in crime and corrections.
[26:18.510 --> 26:22.630]  Number seven in education. Number 11 and 12 in national environment.
[26:22.750 --> 26:26.250]  Number 10 in economy. It's obviously number five in infrastructure.
[26:26.370 --> 26:28.750]  You know, they got to have an infrastructure to handle all that corn.
[26:28.910 --> 26:30.690]  Number 11 in fiscal stability.
[26:30.830 --> 26:34.780]  I am talking about the great agricultural state of Nebraska.
[26:35.550 --> 26:41.090]  Population of 1.967 million people. GDP of 1.162 billion.
[26:41.190 --> 26:42.130]  That's a lot of popcorn.
[26:42.130 --> 26:43.750]  Capital of Lincoln.
[26:45.610 --> 26:46.830]  It was on my list as well.
[26:47.430 --> 26:48.410]  Oh, wow.
[26:49.670 --> 26:50.130]  Was it really?
[26:50.790 --> 26:51.570]  I'm just going down there.
[26:52.190 --> 26:56.270]  It's on the U.S. News and World Report power rankings.
[26:56.810 --> 27:01.350]  What's the population of Austin, Texas? Is it half the population of Nebraska?
[27:01.790 --> 27:04.310]  The population of Austin, Texas is a little over a million.
[27:04.830 --> 27:08.230]  So it's about half the population of the state of Nebraska.
[27:08.230 --> 27:11.950]  Well, the metro, I mean, the city itself is like right at a million.
[27:12.070 --> 27:13.810]  The metro is 2.4 million.
[27:14.070 --> 27:19.230]  So the metro area, which includes like Georgetown, Cedar Park, that area, is about 2.5 million.
[27:19.650 --> 27:24.770]  So you're saying Nebraska makes enough popcorn to fill like four and a half Empire State buildings.
[27:25.910 --> 27:26.310]  Excuse me?
[27:26.550 --> 27:27.550]  Yeah, are you saying that?
[27:28.130 --> 27:29.910]  I don't know. I'm just saying what I read.
[27:30.690 --> 27:31.770]  Is that all you're saying?
[27:32.630 --> 27:35.030]  I said that Nebraska makes enough popcorn.
[27:35.370 --> 27:39.970]  They make 68 billion cups of popcorn every year, and that's enough to fill the Empire State building 18 times.
[27:40.550 --> 27:43.450]  And that they produce more than 25% of our country's popcorn supply.
[27:43.630 --> 27:44.630]  What's your issue with that, Gavin?
[27:45.250 --> 27:48.930]  I thought the total popcorn was 18 Empire States, and they did 25%.
[27:49.470 --> 27:52.570]  So I was like, oh, maybe Nebraska alone is like four Empire States.
[27:53.270 --> 27:53.710]  What?
[27:54.230 --> 27:55.310]  I see what you're saying.
[27:56.650 --> 28:02.890]  Hey, why is, Geoff, you picked this state, and I'm just curious, like Lincoln is the capital, right?
[28:03.210 --> 28:04.690]  According to my research, yes.
[28:05.070 --> 28:11.810]  Great. But Omaha is like the city that I, when I think of Nebraska, I think of Omaha.
[28:12.090 --> 28:14.270]  Yeah, but mostly because of mutual of Omaha.
[28:15.110 --> 28:22.450]  That must be the reason. Why is it, why is Omaha trying to escape the state of Nebraska and move into the state of Iowa?
[28:22.450 --> 28:30.710]  I'm glad you asked. So Omaha, it had been the territorial capital for a long time, but the Cedar government eventually got moved to Lancaster,
[28:31.330 --> 28:35.450]  which was renamed Lincoln following the assassination of Lincoln in 1865.
[28:36.530 --> 28:42.750]  I don't know if that exactly answers your words, but there are probably some, kind of like how Philadelphia used to be the seat of power in America,
[28:43.190 --> 28:48.350]  but then they refer to the elites who left to go live in the swamp in Washington, D.C.
[28:48.730 --> 28:50.650]  As they say, they're still bitter about it.
[28:50.650 --> 28:57.210]  But I imagine the Omahans are bitter about having the seat of government ripped out from under them.
[28:57.490 --> 28:58.690]  Did you think about any of that, Andrew?
[28:59.530 --> 29:03.110]  All of it. It's a consideration I typically have.
[29:04.410 --> 29:07.490]  Well, there you go. That's a great third pick.
[29:07.730 --> 29:08.030]  Thank you.
[29:08.150 --> 29:13.670]  Gavin, you're going to get our last third pick and our final fourth pick in our state draft.
[29:13.670 --> 29:17.510]  Okay. All right. Here we go.
[29:19.430 --> 29:22.030]  Oh, great state song.
[29:22.250 --> 29:23.490]  That's a fugue state.
[29:24.130 --> 29:25.750]  Oh, yeah.
[29:26.210 --> 29:29.610]  A disassociative episode. Oh, I didn't say that right.
[29:32.170 --> 29:39.410]  I've, I learned about it from Breaking Bad, where you could see into Bryan Cranston's asshole almost from across the shop.
[29:40.870 --> 29:45.090]  I thought you were taking New Mexico. I thought he was drafting New Mexico.
[29:45.690 --> 29:53.310]  Me too. A hundred percent. Absolutely agree with you. Thought he was picking New Mexico. I was about to write it and then he said fugue.
[29:53.310 --> 29:56.730]  So. Fugues.
[29:58.290 --> 30:09.510]  Reversible amnesia for one's identity, including memories, personality, and other identifying characteristic characteristics of individuality.
[30:10.210 --> 30:13.410]  How much popcorn can you fit into a fugue state?
[30:14.470 --> 30:17.230]  You can fit at least one cup of popcorn into that picture.
[30:17.630 --> 30:21.650]  Are you on the verge of experiencing a fugue state right now?
[30:22.390 --> 30:24.770]  I think so. I had too much coffee today.
[30:25.470 --> 30:28.810]  You need to do our final pick. You can't go into a fugue state until we're done with this draft.
[30:29.290 --> 30:35.030]  Okay, well, I'll be honest. My only stupid pick originally was liquid, and then I had Idaho and Nebraska.
[30:35.210 --> 30:42.830]  So we're really reaching, we're stretching. My final pick is nuclear criticality.
[30:43.170 --> 30:48.030]  The state of a nuclear power station where everything is going right.
[30:48.890 --> 30:55.090]  And I think that's one of the best states that can possibly exist inside nuclear power.
[30:55.410 --> 30:58.830]  At least all mine have state in the name. I just want that stated.
[30:59.070 --> 30:59.670]  They're states.
[31:00.610 --> 31:01.050]  Okay.
[31:02.630 --> 31:11.770]  I'm not giving you an inch, Andrew. I don't know. If you're doing state of play or whatever, then Gavin can do nuclear criticality.
[31:12.110 --> 31:13.070]  No, it has state in the name.
[31:14.930 --> 31:16.970]  Couldn't just pick Iowa.
[31:18.990 --> 31:19.890]  Big state.
[31:19.910 --> 31:21.610]  I didn't research those.
[31:23.230 --> 31:26.130]  You did do research on nuclear criticality?
[31:26.430 --> 31:29.770]  A little bit. I did a little bit of panic research on that.
[31:30.030 --> 31:33.450]  You've been to, what, like 22, 23 states? You can't...
[31:33.450 --> 31:33.790]  29.
[31:34.710 --> 31:40.730]  But the thing is, Andrew, I'm looking at your column, and it's really spurring me on in possibly the wrong direction.
[31:42.090 --> 31:43.850]  Don't you start blaming me.
[31:45.090 --> 31:46.130]  Oh, Lord.
[31:47.590 --> 31:50.130]  Well, Geoff, what is your final pick?
[31:50.930 --> 31:56.630]  Okay, my final state, moving down the U.S. News and World Report power rankings.
[31:56.870 --> 32:03.750]  This state is... well, actually, this state is interesting because it spawned a lot of people, a lot of famous people, a lot of talented people you may have heard of.
[32:03.750 --> 32:14.610]  I'm talking about Gilbert Godfrey, David Wayne, Ken Marino, Michael Showalter, Joe Latrullio, Kerry Kinney, Michael Ian Black.
[32:14.750 --> 32:24.430]  All of these people were cast in the 1993 television show on MTV, The State, which is one of the best sketch comedy shows of all time.
[32:24.630 --> 32:28.730]  And if you've never seen it, I really recommend it.
[32:28.750 --> 32:29.290]  I've never even heard of it.
[32:29.290 --> 32:31.690]  It's got the famous catchphrase, I dip my balls in it.
[32:31.690 --> 32:40.690]  I will say, Geoff, did you have The State as one of your original picks or were you spurred on by Gavin and Andrew?
[32:40.810 --> 32:42.870]  I always had The State as number four.
[32:43.330 --> 32:43.610]  Okay.
[32:44.390 --> 32:50.430]  I was going to take the best three state states available via U.S. News and World Report and then I was going to mix it up.
[32:50.710 --> 32:59.690]  The State is just most people that went on to do Reno 911 and Stella and...
[32:59.690 --> 33:01.010]  Oh, yeah.
[33:01.630 --> 33:03.650]  Wet Hot American Summer, all the same people.
[33:04.130 --> 33:08.070]  Yep. So, very cool. The State, good one. That's very cool.
[33:08.370 --> 33:09.910]  Why are you cool with that one but not Andrew's?
[33:10.490 --> 33:11.750]  Oh, I'm not cool with this.
[33:11.850 --> 33:12.150]  He's not.
[33:13.730 --> 33:14.710]  No, again.
[33:15.590 --> 33:17.770]  Yeah, it's just, no, it's cool. I mean, The State is cool.
[33:18.370 --> 33:20.970]  As a pick in our state draft, it's not cool.
[33:21.810 --> 33:25.130]  But as a thing in itself, I do like it.
[33:25.150 --> 33:28.810]  Eric, I think you've learned a valuable lesson in being specific over text.
[33:28.810 --> 33:32.770]  Yeah, yeah. That's right. I'm a fucking idiot.
[33:33.070 --> 33:40.090]  I will say, if I hadn't picked The State, it was going to be Minnesota, so Minnesota's up for grabs if anybody wants it.
[33:40.490 --> 33:41.090]  That's great.
[33:42.990 --> 33:48.290]  I will say, my last pick, I think, is going to be one that was never on anyone's list.
[33:48.690 --> 33:53.190]  I don't think that, I don't think anyone was going to pick it. I think it's a cool state.
[33:53.190 --> 33:59.670]  New Hampshire. Small state. New England state. It's up there at the top. They got black bears.
[34:00.210 --> 34:03.050]  Their motto is live free or die. I think it's great.
[34:03.390 --> 34:11.450]  But, if I were to take over this state, like, in my thinking of like, oh, you know, if I'm picking my states, I'm going to make a union out of my states.
[34:11.970 --> 34:13.330]  New Hampshire is my pick.
[34:14.190 --> 34:15.350]  The first state, right?
[34:16.350 --> 34:17.970]  Is it the first state? Nick would know.
[34:17.970 --> 34:21.470]  It's the first state in the presidential primaries, right?
[34:21.470 --> 34:24.530]  I think it might be. I think you're right.
[34:25.730 --> 34:29.630]  My reasoning for it is the live free or die thing is very cool.
[34:29.790 --> 34:33.290]  And also, if I were to take over that state, I would rename it to New Hamster.
[34:33.870 --> 34:35.210]  And that would just be the end of it.
[34:35.670 --> 34:41.970]  So, that's my thinking for New Hampshire and why it's my fourth pick in this state draft.
[34:42.270 --> 34:43.270]  I stuck with states.
[34:43.870 --> 34:46.990]  You know what, Eric? I saw a New Hampshire license plate yesterday. Small world.
[34:47.250 --> 34:47.870]  Oh, that's fun.
[34:47.870 --> 34:48.270]  Yeah.
[34:48.750 --> 34:53.570]  There you go. Nick, what's your fourth pick?
[34:53.730 --> 34:54.830]  What's your bullshit fourth pick?
[34:55.030 --> 34:59.390]  No, no, it's a state in the union and I only went off track because Eric stole Pennsylvania.
[35:00.430 --> 35:01.390]  That's his own fault.
[35:02.090 --> 35:03.110]  That's retaliatory.
[35:03.330 --> 35:04.510]  Yeah, it really was.
[35:04.510 --> 35:05.350]  Exactly, payback.
[35:06.050 --> 35:13.710]  This state is home to four national parks and, allegedly, the largest airport in size in the U.S.
[35:14.130 --> 35:15.790]  It is Colorado.
[35:16.470 --> 35:16.910]  Colorado.
[35:17.130 --> 35:20.090]  Colorado was on my list. I almost took it.
[35:20.230 --> 35:21.230]  I love that state.
[35:22.130 --> 35:24.490]  Face Jam actually took a road trip up there, which was a lot of fun, too.
[35:24.670 --> 35:32.950]  And what a great way to see that in a car with three coworkers and another van full of people shooting everything you do.
[35:34.590 --> 35:35.630]  Not friends, coworkers.
[35:36.230 --> 35:38.070]  Couple of...
[35:38.070 --> 35:38.990]  Friends and coworkers.
[35:39.130 --> 35:40.950]  Michael's made it very clear that we are coworkers.
[35:41.050 --> 35:43.850]  People that I have a professional working relationship with.
[35:43.850 --> 35:45.810]  People who hold microphones near me.
[35:46.610 --> 35:48.230]  What do you think of the shape?
[35:49.470 --> 35:50.010]  The state?
[35:50.290 --> 35:50.530]  Great shape.
[35:51.670 --> 35:53.270]  Great shape for Colorado.
[35:53.870 --> 35:54.250]  Beautiful.
[35:55.430 --> 35:58.390]  Couple of facts. They have the highest paved road in the U.S.
[35:58.730 --> 36:01.390]  The longest continuous street in the U.S.
[36:01.830 --> 36:04.250]  World War II troops trained for mountain combat there.
[36:04.830 --> 36:07.430]  And, allegedly, the cheeseburger was invented in Denver.
[36:07.950 --> 36:12.250]  That's true. I've read that. That's in my list of state facts. The cheeseburger was invented there.
[36:12.250 --> 36:12.950]  Really?
[36:13.510 --> 36:15.410]  So thank you to Colorado.
[36:16.510 --> 36:30.110]  That's good. The only reason it was lower on my list and I didn't pick it is because I was just there and it takes like 45 minutes to get from a city to the airport.
[36:30.510 --> 36:32.090]  And that knocks it way down.
[36:32.750 --> 36:34.210]  Oh my God.
[36:35.050 --> 36:40.170]  Do you guys want to hear a fucking small world thing about Denver? Or about Colorado?
[36:40.170 --> 36:48.270]  While there's much contention around where the cheeseburger was really invented, it was in Colorado that the term was coined.
[36:49.090 --> 36:56.530]  Trademarked by Louis Ballast of Denver's Humpty Dumpty Drive-In in Denver in 1935.
[36:57.130 --> 37:00.990]  It was coined at the Humpty Dumpty Drive-In.
[37:01.610 --> 37:02.010]  Wow.
[37:03.030 --> 37:04.010]  God damn, dude.
[37:04.630 --> 37:06.190]  Boy's a dumpty right again.
[37:07.610 --> 37:08.350]  Incredible.
[37:08.350 --> 37:08.410]  Incredible.
[37:11.450 --> 37:11.970]  Oh man.
[37:12.370 --> 37:14.330]  Well, there you have it. And now, Andrew.
[37:14.710 --> 37:15.870]  Oh, shit.
[37:16.590 --> 37:18.110]  He's just gonna do like fine glass.
[37:20.370 --> 37:23.530]  Andrew's scrambling because Gavin picked nuclear criticality.
[37:26.550 --> 37:29.670]  He was gonna pick Colorado and now he's like, oh fuck, what am I gonna do?
[37:30.750 --> 37:34.610]  Well, I've been to four states and two of them I didn't want to take.
[37:34.610 --> 37:39.090]  So I did plan on taking one of the ones I went at this spot, but that's gone.
[37:39.410 --> 37:40.570]  Mine are taken.
[37:40.810 --> 37:42.730]  So I have no real states I could pick.
[37:42.870 --> 37:48.850]  I did consider, because I love it so much, just drafting state of play the film.
[37:49.450 --> 37:51.930]  As opposed to it's a different thing than the livestream.
[37:52.170 --> 37:53.210]  But I'm not gonna do that.
[37:53.650 --> 37:58.030]  I'm gonna stick, once again, real state in a fictitious place.
[37:59.010 --> 38:01.890]  Blue Mountain State will be my final pick of the draft.
[38:01.890 --> 38:02.430]  Oh.
[38:03.410 --> 38:07.150]  Once again, it's a state in the world that it's in.
[38:07.490 --> 38:08.430]  It's Alan Ritchson.
[38:08.910 --> 38:09.970]  Yeah, you know him.
[38:10.670 --> 38:13.290]  I've never seen the show, I don't have a lot to say about it.
[38:15.090 --> 38:15.770]  Wait, what?
[38:16.290 --> 38:18.690]  And yet it's your fourth and final pick.
[38:18.870 --> 38:22.290]  Well, the states I've visited have already been taken, so I can't take those.
[38:22.530 --> 38:23.210]  Every state?
[38:24.070 --> 38:27.750]  Well, Hawaii, I was open to Hawaii or Washington.
[38:27.750 --> 38:29.330]  Oh, you mean Eric's third pick?
[38:30.350 --> 38:32.710]  Yeah, Hawaii or Washington would be my two.
[38:33.390 --> 38:34.390]  That I considered.
[38:35.570 --> 38:37.790]  Yeah, I don't think I could take two states of play.
[38:38.270 --> 38:40.790]  I have state of decay, but that just felt... I don't know.
[38:41.130 --> 38:43.470]  I liked the first game, I didn't really like the second one that much.
[38:43.870 --> 38:46.530]  Right. State of emergency, you didn't feel...
[38:46.530 --> 38:47.890]  Thought about that, yeah, I never played it.
[38:47.910 --> 38:51.790]  That was like the game on the shelf that I wasn't allowed to rent when I was a kid.
[38:51.970 --> 38:52.750]  But always looked cool.
[38:53.030 --> 38:54.870]  It was an 18, and I wasn't allowed to rent that either.
[38:54.930 --> 38:56.030]  Yeah, exactly.
[38:56.610 --> 38:57.930]  I'm a Blue Mountain State.
[38:58.550 --> 39:00.970]  Not a lot of Texas fans in the room.
[39:01.150 --> 39:02.910]  No, I was never going to take Texas.
[39:03.050 --> 39:04.130]  No, I couldn't take Texas.
[39:04.130 --> 39:04.610]  Terrible state.
[39:04.610 --> 39:08.470]  That was one of my four. My other one I was never going to take is California, personally.
[39:08.570 --> 39:10.010]  I just have no need for it.
[39:10.290 --> 39:11.650]  I have pretty similar weather.
[39:12.010 --> 39:12.870]  You don't need California?
[39:13.290 --> 39:15.410]  I don't need it. It's right next to me.
[39:15.830 --> 39:19.610]  Blue Mountain State is based on Virginia Tech, so that would be the state.
[39:19.830 --> 39:20.190]  Oh.
[39:21.010 --> 39:22.230]  Well, it's based on, it isn't.
[39:22.230 --> 39:22.810]  Sure.
[39:24.370 --> 39:24.810]  Right.
[39:25.250 --> 39:27.270]  But isn't Washington closer to you?
[39:27.910 --> 39:29.190]  Yeah, but that was taken.
[39:29.930 --> 39:32.430]  But you said you didn't want to take California because it's close to you.
[39:32.530 --> 39:33.890]  But the one you were going to take is even closer.
[39:34.010 --> 39:36.830]  Yeah, but Washington has a different feel. California...
[39:37.630 --> 39:38.070]  Yeah.
[39:38.490 --> 39:40.070]  Yeah, Gavin. Come on.
[39:40.190 --> 39:41.270]  Oh, sorry. I apologize.
[39:41.910 --> 39:43.250]  Thank you for apologizing.
[39:44.350 --> 39:45.570]  Apology barely accepted.
[39:46.410 --> 39:48.610]  You know how Eric complained about the airport?
[39:48.850 --> 39:50.290]  The distance to the airport, Colorado?
[39:50.290 --> 39:52.070]  That's my feelings about California.
[39:52.190 --> 39:53.870]  It's a little too far for the same.
[39:54.050 --> 39:58.070]  The overlap in Washington, it's close enough for me to be okay with it.
[39:58.370 --> 40:00.670]  I could take a 60 minute boat ride to get there.
[40:01.170 --> 40:06.330]  I feel like California shouldn't be on there because LAX is the worst airport in the world.
[40:06.430 --> 40:07.250]  No, it's not.
[40:07.530 --> 40:10.590]  It's definitely not. It's not even close.
[40:11.370 --> 40:13.210]  Atlanta's got the worst airport in the world.
[40:13.730 --> 40:15.130]  Chicago O'Hare?
[40:15.250 --> 40:16.470]  Chicago O'Hare.
[40:16.670 --> 40:19.150]  Oh, that's a dog shit airport, too.
[40:19.150 --> 40:21.290]  I think, well, Chicago, I always get delayed.
[40:21.410 --> 40:28.550]  But as an airport, it's more welcoming than the blast in the face of noise and filth that occurs at LAX.
[40:28.670 --> 40:30.210]  Especially when coming international.
[40:31.550 --> 40:31.730]  Oh.
[40:32.390 --> 40:33.630]  No, no, no.
[40:34.890 --> 40:35.450]  Okay.
[40:37.110 --> 40:39.350]  I would much rather go to LAX than Atlanta.
[40:39.930 --> 40:41.590]  Yeah. Atlanta's fun.
[40:42.610 --> 40:44.690]  I'd rather go to LAX than O'Hare.
[40:44.690 --> 40:49.110]  Has anyone ever flown out of O'Hare on time in history?
[40:49.410 --> 40:50.130]  Not ever.
[40:50.690 --> 40:51.250]  No, never.
[40:51.850 --> 40:52.890]  It's not possible.
[40:52.990 --> 40:54.070]  You'd lose your kid in that airport.
[40:54.530 --> 41:01.450]  I'd rather fly Heathrow to Austin via LA than Chicago O'Hare.
[41:02.910 --> 41:04.530]  And I have done that before.
[41:05.790 --> 41:07.010]  But not by choice.
[41:07.630 --> 41:07.970]  Wow.
[41:10.190 --> 41:12.250]  Well, that's our draft.
[41:12.250 --> 41:14.710]  Let me just go through these picks.
[41:16.310 --> 41:17.090]  Andrew.
[41:18.490 --> 41:19.970]  Empire State of Mind.
[41:20.390 --> 41:22.250]  Shout out to 560 State Street.
[41:22.750 --> 41:22.950]  Great.
[41:23.450 --> 41:24.450]  Big State.
[41:25.150 --> 41:26.690]  State of Play.
[41:27.430 --> 41:28.950]  And Blue Mountain State.
[41:29.690 --> 41:30.470]  Never seen it.
[41:34.290 --> 41:36.710]  Nick has picked Washington.
[41:38.090 --> 41:39.630]  Triple X State of the Union.
[41:40.830 --> 41:41.590]  Alaska.
[41:42.330 --> 41:42.890]  And Colorado.
[41:43.910 --> 41:44.670]  Eric.
[41:45.370 --> 41:48.210]  Who played in the spirit of the draft.
[41:48.450 --> 41:49.210]  California.
[41:50.150 --> 41:50.730]  Pennsylvania.
[41:51.250 --> 41:51.690]  Hawaii.
[41:52.210 --> 41:52.850]  And New Hamster.
[41:54.630 --> 41:56.290]  Fourth was Geoff.
[41:57.010 --> 41:58.450]  Who almost did it.
[41:58.990 --> 42:01.550]  Utah. Idaho. Nebraska.
[42:02.050 --> 42:03.090]  And The State.
[42:03.410 --> 42:04.950]  So, sorry, just for a second.
[42:05.050 --> 42:06.490]  You were reading off of a list, Geoff?
[42:06.490 --> 42:07.830]  Of what the number one were?
[42:08.250 --> 42:10.470]  Yeah, it was like the best states in America.
[42:10.590 --> 42:12.430]  As ranked by U.S. News and World Report.
[42:12.630 --> 42:14.450]  It's a list that they put out every year.
[42:14.690 --> 42:15.850]  It wasn't even your picks.
[42:16.270 --> 42:18.070]  No, that's what I was saying.
[42:18.110 --> 42:19.410]  I was going off the power rankings.
[42:19.990 --> 42:22.390]  I feel like it's like when I would do a fantasy draft
[42:22.390 --> 42:24.250]  with a magazine and I'm just getting the next
[42:24.250 --> 42:25.770]  off the board round after round.
[42:25.910 --> 42:27.090]  You're just getting the best available.
[42:27.370 --> 42:30.210]  I'm trying to build the most powerful state team.
[42:30.630 --> 42:32.430]  And then finally,
[42:33.450 --> 42:33.850]  Gavin.
[42:33.850 --> 42:35.630]  You picked Montana.
[42:37.010 --> 42:37.490]  Liquid.
[42:38.310 --> 42:38.950]  Great pick.
[42:39.490 --> 42:41.730]  Nuclear criticality.
[42:42.330 --> 42:43.210]  I think I've done well.
[42:43.330 --> 42:45.170]  You did really well. I was thinking
[42:45.170 --> 42:47.570]  with Nick talking about Alaska and the ice melting,
[42:47.690 --> 42:48.990]  what happens when the ice melts?
[42:49.450 --> 42:50.250]  What does it do?
[42:51.250 --> 42:53.570]  Comes liquid. What does that liquid become?
[42:53.810 --> 42:55.370]  A Terminator. Terminator 2.
[42:55.510 --> 42:57.990]  An upgrade over the first film. A great film. A terrifying villain.
[42:58.470 --> 42:59.590]  I think that's a great pick.
[42:59.930 --> 43:01.690]  You think the liquid from
[43:01.690 --> 43:03.630]  the melting ice caps turns
[43:03.630 --> 43:05.930]  into Terminator from Terminator 2?
[43:05.930 --> 43:06.870]  Holy shit! What if
[43:06.870 --> 43:09.870]  the whole point of the polar ice caps
[43:09.870 --> 43:11.870]  is that it's all the Terminators
[43:12.730 --> 43:13.290]  ever
[43:13.290 --> 43:15.570]  frozen and global warming
[43:15.570 --> 43:17.630]  is really unleashing the robot army
[43:17.630 --> 43:18.210]  on us?
[43:19.630 --> 43:20.910]  Skynet was here all along.
[43:20.970 --> 43:21.950]  You know, I guess what if?
[43:23.090 --> 43:26.030]  Every Al Gore ad just has the dun dun dun dun dun.
[43:26.270 --> 43:27.610]  Dun dun dun dun dun.
[43:27.710 --> 43:29.150]  So Andrew's just saying I basically
[43:29.150 --> 43:31.090]  drafted the T-1000 which I think
[43:31.090 --> 43:32.950]  is only bonus points.
[43:33.270 --> 43:33.870]  For sure.
[43:35.110 --> 43:37.490]  So if anyone won this, it's me.
[43:37.630 --> 43:39.130]  Yeah, Eric wins by default.
[43:39.310 --> 43:41.230]  I'm sad to say, but he definitely
[43:41.230 --> 43:42.890]  does. We'll see.
[43:43.410 --> 43:43.650]  Yeah.
[43:44.450 --> 43:45.150]  We'll see.
[43:45.990 --> 43:47.010]  We'll see.
[43:48.890 --> 43:50.510]  I go to Montana.
[43:51.650 --> 43:52.430]  Let's go.
[43:52.890 --> 43:54.370]  So you can get it off your list?
[43:54.770 --> 43:55.870]  I'd love to get it off my list.
[43:55.870 --> 43:57.330]  Have you been to Minnesota yet?
[43:58.290 --> 43:58.850]  Let me check.
[44:01.130 --> 44:02.550]  What are you checking?
[44:02.910 --> 44:04.050]  His little app.
[44:05.710 --> 44:07.930]  I don't know. You tell me.
[44:08.110 --> 44:08.290]  Hold on.
[44:09.030 --> 44:12.090]  How often do you use this app?
[44:12.510 --> 44:14.030]  Every time I go to a new state.
[44:14.250 --> 44:16.010]  Is this the app that Becca Fraser
[44:16.010 --> 44:17.690]  told you to use a long time ago?
[44:19.390 --> 44:19.870]  Possibly?
[44:20.310 --> 44:20.490]  Yeah.
[44:21.710 --> 44:24.370]  So you use this app when you go to a new state.
[44:24.370 --> 44:26.330]  So, how often
[44:26.330 --> 44:27.650]  do you use this app?
[44:28.190 --> 44:30.370]  I just went to Kentucky a few months ago.
[44:30.510 --> 44:31.490]  Put that off my list.
[44:33.190 --> 44:33.770]  So...
[44:34.370 --> 44:34.950]  What's new?
[44:35.610 --> 44:37.310]  You should know.
[44:37.610 --> 44:39.270]  He's checking out the updates.
[44:39.530 --> 44:40.150]  You tell me.
[44:40.670 --> 44:41.750]  Oh, wow.
[44:43.770 --> 44:45.330]  You've really caught...
[44:45.330 --> 44:48.190]  You're going around in spiral style
[44:48.190 --> 44:49.250]  taking over the US.
[44:49.590 --> 44:52.370]  Basically, that is 10 years worth of business trips.
[44:52.370 --> 44:54.290]  And nothing has ever
[44:54.290 --> 44:56.570]  taken me to that big hunk in the middle.
[44:56.690 --> 44:58.330]  Like, what is there? What is out there?
[44:58.610 --> 44:59.310]  Not a lot of business.
[44:59.570 --> 45:01.150]  You fly over that.
[45:01.450 --> 45:03.850]  That's where all the potatoes and corn are, man.
[45:04.210 --> 45:04.650]  Yeah.
[45:06.450 --> 45:08.390]  All of those that aren't highlighted,
[45:08.650 --> 45:10.310]  those are what we call the flyover states.
[45:11.630 --> 45:14.290]  So you've never been to Minnesota, just so you can
[45:14.290 --> 45:16.230]  understand it. You know how Louisiana is the boot?
[45:16.850 --> 45:17.990]  Right? At the bottom.
[45:18.250 --> 45:18.790]  It looks like a boot.
[45:18.790 --> 45:19.510]  Oh, yeah.
[45:20.130 --> 45:22.910]  If you follow the leg all the way up to the top,
[45:22.950 --> 45:25.010]  the very top where the thigh is,
[45:25.170 --> 45:26.450]  and it looks like it's going to touch a crotch,
[45:26.610 --> 45:27.410]  that's Minnesota.
[45:28.190 --> 45:30.370]  Well, there you have it. The state draft.
[45:31.490 --> 45:32.470]  I had a great time.
[45:33.110 --> 45:33.510]  Great.
[45:34.730 --> 45:35.430]  I'm amazed.
[45:35.970 --> 45:38.810]  I'm amazed this wasn't a blindside, and I'm so happy
[45:38.810 --> 45:39.390]  it wasn't.
[45:41.570 --> 45:42.770]  I was having
[45:42.770 --> 45:44.770]  a drink at a wedding, and I went, wouldn't this be fun?
[45:45.330 --> 45:46.490]  And here we are.
[45:47.310 --> 45:48.190]  You were right.
[45:48.610 --> 45:49.990]  Was it fun? With the big state,
[45:50.570 --> 45:52.810]  XXX State of the Union, and Fugue
[45:52.810 --> 45:54.050]  all on the draft board.
[45:55.070 --> 45:55.470]  Fantastic.
[45:56.370 --> 45:58.590]  When you were having that conversation at the wedding,
[45:58.690 --> 46:00.670]  did you not think Bryan Cranston's ass
[46:00.670 --> 46:02.270]  was going to come up? Not even a possibility?
[46:02.790 --> 46:04.570]  No, it definitely didn't cross
[46:04.570 --> 46:06.330]  my mind while I was at the wedding, no.
[46:06.370 --> 46:08.630]  I don't think I've ever had that thought.
[46:09.030 --> 46:10.570]  No, also
[46:10.570 --> 46:12.610]  have not. No. Ever, ever.
[46:13.090 --> 46:14.010]  But we did it.
[46:14.010 --> 46:16.010]  We've done another successful draft
[46:16.010 --> 46:18.110]  for F*** Face. Thank you so much for listening.
[46:18.870 --> 46:20.250]  You can comment on this
[46:20.250 --> 46:21.930]  and let us know what your states are.
[46:22.390 --> 46:24.130]  I have a question, though. What would this have
[46:24.130 --> 46:26.010]  looked like if we just had a list of
[46:26.010 --> 46:28.030]  half the states? I think that
[46:28.030 --> 46:30.030]  it would have been arguments about
[46:30.030 --> 46:32.030]  people who picked the
[46:32.030 --> 46:34.010]  same states, and someone's going to have to take
[46:34.010 --> 46:36.030]  Wyoming. Yeah, look at how salty people
[46:36.030 --> 46:37.970]  got about states that got picked already.
[46:38.550 --> 46:39.690]  Yeah, so...
[46:39.690 --> 46:41.930]  Nick didn't like that I picked Pennsylvania,
[46:41.930 --> 46:43.830]  so he picked XXX
[46:43.830 --> 46:45.910]  State of the Union. And I'm not talking
[46:45.910 --> 46:48.130]  fancy pink Himalayan salt, either.
[46:48.250 --> 46:50.350]  I'm talking f***ing Morton's
[46:50.350 --> 46:51.790]  gross-ass table salt.
[46:51.990 --> 46:53.030]  I just think
[46:53.810 --> 46:56.210]  that there are 50 states
[46:56.210 --> 46:58.030]  in the U.S. and probably about
[46:58.030 --> 46:59.930]  13 good ones. If that.
[47:00.350 --> 47:02.210]  Maybe 13. And none
[47:02.210 --> 47:03.430]  of the ones I picked, by the way.
[47:03.770 --> 47:05.690]  Because if you... Utah
[47:05.690 --> 47:07.430]  is a first pick. Crazy.
[47:07.770 --> 47:09.890]  I'm just happy that no one picked Arizona,
[47:09.890 --> 47:11.990]  which I feel is the worst
[47:11.990 --> 47:12.910]  state in the Union.
[47:14.090 --> 47:15.890]  You think Arizona's
[47:16.710 --> 47:17.650]  worse than Louisiana?
[47:18.450 --> 47:20.110]  Yes. Oh, man.
[47:20.170 --> 47:21.670]  I think Arizona is a sh...
[47:21.670 --> 47:23.050]  I think it should get split.
[47:23.570 --> 47:25.590]  No, dude. Arizona's got...
[47:25.590 --> 47:27.610]  I think the four states around it should
[47:27.610 --> 47:29.490]  each take a piece and
[47:29.490 --> 47:31.730]  expand a little bit. Arizona's a mess.
[47:31.750 --> 47:32.970]  First off, Tucson is cool.
[47:33.910 --> 47:35.470]  And Flagstaff is cool. No.
[47:35.730 --> 47:37.750]  The rest of the state's not. Flagstaff's cool
[47:37.750 --> 47:39.710]  as fuck, dude. Flagstaff
[47:39.710 --> 47:41.810]  is the spot. Don't sleep
[47:41.810 --> 47:42.430]  on Flagstaff.
[47:43.530 --> 47:45.470]  Sleep all you want on Flagstaff. Don't do it.
[47:45.590 --> 47:46.350]  It's a cool-ass town.
[47:47.950 --> 47:49.850]  I'm just wondering if I live here,
[47:49.950 --> 47:51.790]  if I just keep living here and don't go home,
[47:52.090 --> 47:53.790]  what will be the last state I naturally
[47:53.790 --> 47:55.670]  visit? Because I think eventually
[47:55.670 --> 47:57.650]  I'll get taken to some more. I think
[47:57.650 --> 47:59.650]  Alaska? See, I could see myself filming
[47:59.650 --> 48:01.550]  something there. I feel like I would never
[48:01.550 --> 48:03.570]  touch Wyoming. I don't think there would
[48:03.570 --> 48:05.510]  ever be a reason to do that. No, you would
[48:05.510 --> 48:07.430]  touch Wyoming because it's a big
[48:08.250 --> 48:09.670]  place for influencers to
[48:09.670 --> 48:11.330]  go out and buy ranches and stuff.
[48:11.670 --> 48:13.390]  Kanye lives out there, and
[48:13.390 --> 48:15.590]  Geoffree Star lives out there, and a lot of those
[48:15.590 --> 48:17.590]  Hollywood types. So there could be a big
[48:17.590 --> 48:19.550]  shoot or some sort of an event or
[48:19.550 --> 48:21.590]  something out there. Yeah, you can go out there with Geoffree Star
[48:21.590 --> 48:23.710]  and Kanye. Yeah, do I give off big Kanye vibes?
[48:23.890 --> 48:25.790]  No, not at all. When I think of you,
[48:25.910 --> 48:27.230]  I'm like, oh, you're filming something. I'm just saying
[48:27.910 --> 48:29.270]  it's become like a playground
[48:29.270 --> 48:31.390]  for a lot of celebrity
[48:31.790 --> 48:33.710]  type people, a lot of people that make content
[48:33.710 --> 48:35.890]  and you tend to...
[48:35.890 --> 48:37.670]  the circles that we work in tend to
[48:37.670 --> 48:39.650]  go where content is from time to time, and I can see
[48:39.650 --> 48:41.690]  there being a better chance of you going there than
[48:41.690 --> 48:43.130]  like North Dakota.
[48:43.710 --> 48:45.630]  Oh, I think it's... see, I think
[48:45.630 --> 48:47.230]  Maine. I don't think you're going to Maine.
[48:47.930 --> 48:49.670]  I think if you go to one of those places,
[48:49.750 --> 48:51.630]  you go to all of them at once, right? You just do like a little
[48:51.630 --> 48:53.650]  road trip? Yeah. I feel like Apple
[48:53.650 --> 48:55.150]  could potentially take us to Maine.
[48:55.770 --> 48:57.730]  I just think Maine is way
[48:57.730 --> 48:59.810]  up there, and you've already hit pretty much
[48:59.810 --> 49:01.110]  everything else around there.
[49:01.890 --> 49:03.170]  Just doesn't feel like there's
[49:03.170 --> 49:04.670]  going to be a thing where you're like, gotta go to Maine.
[49:04.890 --> 49:06.130]  Has anybody in this
[49:07.050 --> 49:09.130]  video, or this audio, been to Maine?
[49:09.910 --> 49:10.210]  No.
[49:11.410 --> 49:13.230]  Wow. Andrew, you've
[49:13.230 --> 49:14.630]  obviously never been to Maine.
[49:15.390 --> 49:17.270]  I wonder how many states
[49:17.270 --> 49:19.210]  in America there are that none of us have been
[49:19.210 --> 49:20.850]  to. It might only be Maine.
[49:21.450 --> 49:22.930]  Hmm. I mean, everyone
[49:22.930 --> 49:25.050]  fill this app out, and then we'll be up to
[49:25.050 --> 49:26.850]  reference. Yeah, we should, because
[49:26.850 --> 49:28.910]  it would be interesting to find out if there's like one
[49:28.910 --> 49:30.850]  or two or three states that none of us have been to,
[49:30.990 --> 49:32.550]  we could go for the first time together.
[49:32.870 --> 49:34.630]  And you've probably got the most, Geoff, haven't you?
[49:34.950 --> 49:36.930]  Yeah, I've been to like 46 states,
[49:37.010 --> 49:38.930]  I think, 45. Jesus! Wow.
[49:39.210 --> 49:40.970]  So, oh, hang on! Then why are we
[49:40.970 --> 49:43.010]  all filling this out? You just... I'll fill it out.
[49:43.110 --> 49:44.750]  You fill it out, and then we'll go,
[49:44.930 --> 49:46.590]  okay, we haven't been to these four.
[49:46.770 --> 49:48.610]  Alright, I'll fill it out. Well, let me ask you this, Geoff.
[49:48.770 --> 49:50.870]  What from my list have you not been to?
[49:51.070 --> 49:52.150]  I've never been to North Dakota.
[49:53.450 --> 49:54.870]  Uh, I've never been to
[49:55.210 --> 49:55.930]  Maine. Have I?
[49:56.330 --> 49:57.410]  No, I mean...
[49:57.410 --> 49:59.570]  I've never been to...
[49:59.570 --> 50:01.390]  I've never been to Vermont.
[50:01.810 --> 50:02.930]  I've never been to Rhode Island.
[50:04.090 --> 50:05.890]  Um, I've never
[50:05.890 --> 50:06.830]  been to New Hampshire.
[50:07.710 --> 50:09.890]  That's about it. I think those places in North Dakota
[50:09.890 --> 50:10.730]  are the only places I've never been.
[50:12.030 --> 50:13.930]  Yeah. Well, there you have it. The state
[50:13.930 --> 50:15.850]  draft, only the way that
[50:15.850 --> 50:17.330]  f***face could do it. Um,
[50:17.750 --> 50:19.690]  thank you so much for listening. Well, you f***ing asshole,
[50:19.770 --> 50:21.350]  I told you! Uh-huh.
[50:21.510 --> 50:23.710]  No, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I appreciate it. Um,
[50:24.510 --> 50:25.970]  if you like this,
[50:26.130 --> 50:27.750]  listen to the other ones.
[50:27.910 --> 50:30.010]  They're pretty much like this, but
[50:30.770 --> 50:31.750]  weirder, I would think.
[50:32.130 --> 50:33.490]  Uh, thanks for listening.
[50:33.730 --> 50:35.770]  Go give us a follow
[50:36.730 --> 50:37.610]  at f***facepod
[50:37.610 --> 50:39.430]  on Instagram, on Twitter.
[50:39.850 --> 50:41.750]  Uh, go follow us on YouTube. You can
[50:41.750 --> 50:43.690]  watch this or listen to it, whatever you like.
[50:43.690 --> 50:45.810]  And you can check out all of our cool, cool
[50:45.810 --> 50:47.690]  content. Thank you so much for listening.
[50:48.150 --> 50:49.770]  Um, Andrew, any
[50:49.770 --> 50:51.670]  parting words for everyone out there? Uh,
[50:51.670 --> 50:53.650]  shoutout to 500 State Street, once again.
[50:53.870 --> 50:54.710]  Can I ask a question?
[50:55.630 --> 50:58.010]  Are you saying, Eric, that the other drafts
[50:58.010 --> 50:59.670]  are weirder than the state of play
[50:59.670 --> 51:01.290]  and nuclear criticality?
[51:02.030 --> 51:03.730]  I don't think they are. I mean...
[51:03.730 --> 51:05.550]  That's so f***ing up there.
[51:05.970 --> 51:07.730]  I think Rock Not Rock is a tough
[51:07.730 --> 51:08.870]  one to top. Hmm.
[51:10.450 --> 51:11.490]  It, like,
[51:11.970 --> 51:13.610]  on its face, it's telling you
[51:13.610 --> 51:15.650]  what it is, and I think we really take it in, like,
[51:15.650 --> 51:17.690]  a lot of different directions. So, I think
[51:17.690 --> 51:19.530]  Rock Not Rock is definitely at the top.
[51:19.530 --> 51:21.090]  What do you think, audience?
[51:22.870 --> 51:23.710]  State of play.
[51:25.110 --> 51:25.750]  We're just
[51:25.750 --> 51:26.010]  playing.
[51:27.210 --> 51:28.150]  Okay, that's enough.
