[00:15.120 --> 00:20.100]  Alright, well, here we are. Sausage Talk. Episode 2. I'm dizzy.
[00:20.940 --> 00:23.780]  Yeah. You're still dizzy. I've got a gut full of soda.
[00:24.160 --> 00:30.200]  We did the Gerpler, no burpler, for... have we talked about what that's...
[00:30.900 --> 00:33.700]  Yeah, I think so. Yeah. It's for the... I think we have, haven't we?
[00:34.020 --> 00:36.620]  I don't know, that's why I looked at you and I said, have we talked about this?
[00:36.660 --> 00:40.560]  Wait a second. We filmed a special video that goes on the 10 Golden Gerplers.
[00:40.560 --> 00:43.340]  Yeah. Which is a thing I think we've established.
[00:43.580 --> 00:46.200]  I hope that it's a thing we haven't established and people are listening to this and going,
[00:46.360 --> 00:50.320]  the 10 what? Who knows.
[00:50.420 --> 00:54.800]  There's a special thing for the winners of the Golden Gerps that will probably end up
[00:55.360 --> 00:58.040]  visible for everyone to see. Probably. It's up to the audience.
[00:58.040 --> 00:59.300]  Depending on the people who win. Yeah.
[00:59.560 --> 01:01.320]  Winner is a weird way to phrase it. It's just random.
[01:01.700 --> 01:03.660]  10 people who buy this cup will get this.
[01:04.340 --> 01:06.140]  Well, it's that the lottery is random, isn't it?
[01:06.480 --> 01:10.040]  Yeah, I guess. That's fair. Hey, you know what? That was a great counterpoint.
[01:10.040 --> 01:11.720]  Pretty, pretty interesting take, Gavin.
[01:12.320 --> 01:15.240]  We're not doing the boring thing. That's not what this is.
[01:15.300 --> 01:17.300]  I'm not saying we are. I just think he's really interesting.
[01:17.500 --> 01:18.920]  He's kind of hanging on his every word.
[01:18.980 --> 01:20.740]  We're gonna make Andrew deafen again. We can't.
[01:20.740 --> 01:22.700]  What a fascinating life. We're not doing it.
[01:22.720 --> 01:25.000]  We were trying to figure out earlier who's more boring, me or Geoff.
[01:25.080 --> 01:26.560]  And Andrew got so boring he deafened.
[01:27.780 --> 01:30.120]  We're gonna fight about this, who's more boring later.
[01:30.180 --> 01:31.180]  It is definitely me.
[01:32.280 --> 01:33.960]  I'm so boring. No, you're not.
[01:34.060 --> 01:37.220]  All right. So what's on this sausage talk? What's on the docket?
[01:37.700 --> 01:39.020]  I have a list of things.
[01:39.020 --> 01:39.420]  Okay.
[01:39.760 --> 01:42.860]  Because I feel like we have a lot of bits in the ether.
[01:43.100 --> 01:45.340]  Eric was kind enough to make a post on the subreddit.
[01:45.520 --> 01:47.140]  Yeah, me and Andrew talked about this.
[01:47.320 --> 01:49.120]  And he reached out on the Discord.
[01:49.420 --> 01:50.580]  I made a post on the subreddit.
[01:51.120 --> 01:53.140]  Because I think Andrew's idea is very good.
[01:53.360 --> 01:55.740]  Reach out to the audience and say, what bits have we dropped?
[01:55.860 --> 01:59.400]  What's some things where we left them in the dust but we should maybe pick up again?
[01:59.800 --> 02:03.260]  And when we talked about it, I said, I'll make the post on the subreddit.
[02:03.400 --> 02:04.900]  Because otherwise everyone's just gonna go,
[02:04.900 --> 02:06.500]  Can you eat the pencil?
[02:06.860 --> 02:09.260]  Eat the pencil. Oh, motherfucking eat the pencil.
[02:09.680 --> 02:10.360]  Print the log.
[02:10.440 --> 02:11.520]  Can you do the pencil?
[02:11.920 --> 02:13.140]  That's all it's gonna be.
[02:13.740 --> 02:16.820]  And he said, I'll go on the Discord because they're a little bit sick of the pencil.
[02:17.220 --> 02:18.720]  So I made this post.
[02:18.980 --> 02:20.560]  And hopefully we got some good responses.
[02:20.700 --> 02:21.200]  I'm sure we did.
[02:22.120 --> 02:23.880]  I pulled a list from there.
[02:24.100 --> 02:26.460]  And I feel like we can either address certain things.
[02:26.620 --> 02:28.480]  Or be like, you know what? Actually, we don't want to do that.
[02:28.520 --> 02:30.620]  We have no interest. So at least it has a conclusion.
[02:30.940 --> 02:31.360]  Let's do that.
[02:31.360 --> 02:32.880]  Let's talk to people who are maybe waiting for something.
[02:33.060 --> 02:35.380]  That's a great idea. In addition to that,
[02:35.500 --> 02:39.220]  I have the Cosmic Crisp care package I can open up.
[02:39.320 --> 02:41.400]  And Gavin has the best of f*** face he can show us.
[02:41.420 --> 02:42.660]  Yeah, I've been working on the best of f*** face.
[02:42.720 --> 02:44.920]  Which I can play for you on this Here's Sausage Talk.
[02:45.040 --> 02:46.760]  We'll also see how much time we have.
[02:46.860 --> 02:49.740]  But we do have a list of merch that we need to figure out.
[02:50.000 --> 02:50.500]  Oh, right, right.
[02:50.760 --> 02:52.420]  Because now we're doing bits for the show.
[02:53.420 --> 02:55.600]  And I really need answers on stuff.
[02:55.860 --> 02:58.100]  Which was the purpose of Sausage Talk.
[02:58.300 --> 02:58.480]  Right.
[02:58.480 --> 03:03.220]  I mean, again, what a surprise.
[03:03.960 --> 03:05.940]  Andrew, do you want to lead us off with some bits
[03:05.940 --> 03:06.920]  that maybe we left in the dust?
[03:07.620 --> 03:08.020]  Sure.
[03:09.000 --> 03:11.840]  Obviously, I feel like I have the leading things
[03:11.840 --> 03:13.400]  that I think I need to do.
[03:13.500 --> 03:14.900]  20,000 things list.
[03:15.340 --> 03:16.580]  Something that will still...
[03:16.580 --> 03:17.760]  I'm still working on it.
[03:18.140 --> 03:20.560]  It will eventually drop suddenly.
[03:21.120 --> 03:21.300]  Okay.
[03:21.520 --> 03:23.020]  So you're just adding to the list?
[03:23.420 --> 03:23.860]  What do you mean?
[03:23.960 --> 03:26.800]  Do you think it's going to drop suddenly in approximately 20,000 days?
[03:28.040 --> 03:28.760]  Uh, yes.
[03:29.240 --> 03:30.480]  Yeah, that feels like a long enough time.
[03:30.500 --> 03:31.700]  Do you do one thing a day, maybe?
[03:32.300 --> 03:34.160]  No, I'm doing more than one thing a day.
[03:34.200 --> 03:36.580]  I'm going in chunks when I revisit it, but it is...
[03:36.580 --> 03:38.980]  I'll be honest, I thought you just straight up failed that.
[03:39.260 --> 03:39.440]  Yeah.
[03:39.720 --> 03:42.300]  No, absolutely not. I'm still working on it. It's still progressing.
[03:42.660 --> 03:44.000]  It's not something I forgot about.
[03:44.200 --> 03:46.260]  Do we want to make, like, a document
[03:46.260 --> 03:47.220]  so we could reference this?
[03:47.220 --> 03:50.460]  Is 20,000 days 54 years?
[03:50.500 --> 03:50.900]  Probably, yeah.
[03:51.140 --> 03:52.300]  Yeah, Andrew.
[03:52.300 --> 03:53.440]  Yeah, I'll be done by then.
[03:54.240 --> 03:55.180]  I'll be done by then.
[03:55.300 --> 03:58.720]  Hey, Andrew, this is what I wanted you to do
[03:58.720 --> 04:00.020]  when you made the list,
[04:00.120 --> 04:02.400]  is put it on this, like,
[04:02.580 --> 04:04.100]  Google Doc so we could access it.
[04:04.100 --> 04:05.100]  We could look at, like,
[04:05.800 --> 04:07.520]  go line by line and have it numbered.
[04:07.720 --> 04:09.440]  And then you did it your own fucking way,
[04:09.520 --> 04:10.620]  and that's why the bit dropped.
[04:11.720 --> 04:13.440]  And Eric was very clear up front
[04:13.440 --> 04:16.060]  on how you shouldn't do it. Highly opinionated.
[04:16.720 --> 04:17.400]  Highly right!
[04:17.640 --> 04:18.000]  Yes.
[04:18.000 --> 04:19.060]  Nobody said you were.
[04:19.140 --> 04:19.580]  No, you're right.
[04:20.620 --> 04:23.080]  I don't like the word opinionated when it's not an opinion
[04:23.080 --> 04:24.540]  when I'm right, when it's a fact.
[04:25.720 --> 04:28.100]  I didn't move to a doc. I'm now in a Google Doc.
[04:28.640 --> 04:29.360]  So I'm doing it that way.
[04:29.460 --> 04:31.740]  Okay, so here's the thing. Highlight everything
[04:31.740 --> 04:33.840]  and then where you can, like,
[04:34.100 --> 04:36.340]  bullet point down, select the numbered one
[04:36.340 --> 04:38.120]  so that way every time you do a new line,
[04:38.640 --> 04:39.340]  it gives a number.
[04:40.640 --> 04:41.560]  Does that make sense?
[04:41.700 --> 04:43.720]  Makes sense. Yeah, yeah, got it.
[04:43.800 --> 04:45.960]  Nice. Definitely don't got it, but I got it.
[04:45.960 --> 04:47.280]  Got it. Next thing.
[04:47.440 --> 04:50.060]  Do we want to make a, like, Google Doc
[04:50.060 --> 04:52.200]  of this so we can, like, reference in the future?
[04:52.420 --> 04:53.940]  No, I think I want to see
[04:53.940 --> 04:56.360]  what these things are and then we'll...
[04:56.360 --> 04:57.880]  I think we can kind of pick them up naturally.
[04:58.240 --> 04:59.000]  That's how it feels to me.
[04:59.520 --> 05:01.960]  So next thing, me, finishing on my thing.
[05:02.020 --> 05:03.640]  I still have three marathons, obviously.
[05:03.820 --> 05:05.460]  That was a fucking insane plan
[05:05.960 --> 05:06.720]  for me to make.
[05:08.040 --> 05:10.000]  And it's from the time I've
[05:10.000 --> 05:11.780]  stated that to now, I've
[05:11.780 --> 05:13.940]  grown a little as a person. I think I've become
[05:13.940 --> 05:15.820]  a little wiser. A little less burger
[05:15.820 --> 05:18.040]  confidence. It's still a thing I'd like to do,
[05:18.120 --> 05:19.840]  but it's just not... it's not
[05:19.840 --> 05:21.920]  possible for me to do. What if you chipped
[05:21.920 --> 05:23.940]  away at it slowly? Or are you
[05:23.940 --> 05:25.880]  saying you have to do them in one go? I know, I think I want
[05:25.880 --> 05:27.980]  to do what I said I would do of the three in a week.
[05:28.060 --> 05:29.900]  I want to give it an honest try,
[05:30.080 --> 05:31.900]  but it's just not... there's zero
[05:31.900 --> 05:33.380]  realistic way that that would happen.
[05:33.600 --> 05:35.960]  The way you feel about these marathons is
[05:35.960 --> 05:37.740]  vastly affected by the percentages
[05:37.740 --> 05:39.360]  of your ankles. What are we at right now?
[05:39.860 --> 05:41.920]  My ankles are great. The problem is when I
[05:41.920 --> 05:43.780]  made that declaration, and then I
[05:43.780 --> 05:45.680]  really fucked up my ankle for like
[05:45.680 --> 05:48.000]  four months last year.
[05:48.680 --> 05:50.180]  And it just... I think I grew wiser
[05:50.180 --> 05:52.140]  in that time of not being able to do anything.
[05:52.220 --> 05:53.980]  Of like, you know what? I am human. I am
[05:53.980 --> 05:56.240]  mortal. I cannot just declare these things.
[05:56.240 --> 05:57.720]  You know what? I am human.
[05:57.860 --> 06:00.060]  I accept it. I accept my
[06:00.060 --> 06:01.960]  humanity. After all these years,
[06:02.580 --> 06:03.100]  I'm human.
[06:03.940 --> 06:06.060]  That was one of the first things I ever
[06:06.060 --> 06:06.460]  learned.
[06:06.460 --> 06:06.720]  Yeah!
[06:10.140 --> 06:12.480]  Oh, I would expect that from such a boring individual
[06:12.480 --> 06:13.940]  like yourself. That makes sense.
[06:14.060 --> 06:14.820]  That lines up.
[06:15.960 --> 06:18.000]  That's on par for you. Now we can
[06:18.000 --> 06:20.480]  move away from me, I feel, and go to
[06:20.480 --> 06:22.420]  Geoff. You still have to throw
[06:22.420 --> 06:23.880]  a second baseball. Real quick,
[06:24.480 --> 06:26.760]  I wonder how long it would take you to walk
[06:27.220 --> 06:28.020]  a marathon
[06:28.020 --> 06:30.440]  throughout the course of a regular day. Like if you just
[06:30.440 --> 06:32.380]  turned a step counter on, and it
[06:32.380 --> 06:34.240]  just like told it to ding you when it hits
[06:34.240 --> 06:36.120]  26.2 miles, do you think it would take you
[06:36.120 --> 06:37.500]  a week? A month?
[06:37.840 --> 06:40.200]  What if you walked from mall to mall in a
[06:40.200 --> 06:42.420]  straight line? Oh, that would probably do it.
[06:42.440 --> 06:44.260]  Oh, mall to mall? That would knock it
[06:44.260 --> 06:46.340]  out real quick. That might be one marathon
[06:46.340 --> 06:48.140]  in itself. The average
[06:48.140 --> 06:50.220]  male step length of 30 inches,
[06:50.320 --> 06:52.200]  that means your marathon would
[06:52.200 --> 06:56.400]  be 55,374 steps to complete.
[06:56.640 --> 06:57.820]  Hmm. Hmm.
[06:58.120 --> 06:59.760]  Interesting. Hmm. Hmm.
[06:59.980 --> 07:01.440]  That's lower than I would have anticipated.
[07:02.000 --> 07:03.440]  Do you realize how
[07:03.440 --> 07:05.260]  many 55,000 is?
[07:05.380 --> 07:07.020]  Because you can't name 20,000 things.
[07:07.200 --> 07:09.200]  And this is more than double. Yeah, no,
[07:09.300 --> 07:11.440]  that's fair. That's two and a half steps
[07:11.440 --> 07:12.200]  per thing, right?
[07:14.980 --> 07:15.520]  You can
[07:15.520 --> 07:16.100]  think and walk.
[07:17.240 --> 07:18.880]  You can kill two birds with one stone.
[07:20.680 --> 07:21.500]  I feel like
[07:21.500 --> 07:23.360]  you're supposed to walk for fitness
[07:23.360 --> 07:25.200]  they say 10,000 steps a day, so that's only
[07:25.200 --> 07:27.240]  five and a half days. Yeah, that
[07:27.240 --> 07:29.240]  doesn't seem too bad. Okay.
[07:29.720 --> 07:31.280]  I need to throw a second baseball.
[07:31.720 --> 07:32.960]  You need to throw a second baseball.
[07:33.100 --> 07:35.400]  You threw one. I don't even remember what you clocked
[07:35.400 --> 07:36.920]  in at. Like 62? 44?
[07:37.520 --> 07:38.880]  62? 49? 44?
[07:39.080 --> 07:41.180]  Now, obviously, you've had a lot of stuff going on.
[07:41.240 --> 07:43.260]  I feel like you still deserve some time to train
[07:43.260 --> 07:45.180]  potentially or adjust in some way.
[07:45.380 --> 07:46.080]  Well, I'm not even
[07:47.260 --> 07:49.220]  convinced that the gun we have works right.
[07:49.940 --> 07:51.420]  I could have been thrown a lot harder than that.
[07:51.860 --> 07:53.700]  We could do an actual...
[07:53.700 --> 07:55.260]  We could just use footage. We can
[07:55.260 --> 07:56.000]  measure the ball
[07:57.120 --> 07:57.840]  with inches
[07:57.840 --> 07:59.980]  or centimeters and then use
[07:59.980 --> 08:01.980]  the footage to see how fast it went. Once again, using
[08:01.980 --> 08:03.240]  wheat. Alright, well, what do you mean?
[08:03.500 --> 08:05.900]  I do it all the time in videos for like bullets and stuff.
[08:06.000 --> 08:08.160]  I'm gonna be honest. You just bored the shit
[08:08.160 --> 08:10.020]  out of me with that. We're not doing that.
[08:10.520 --> 08:11.460]  That's not helping me out right now.
[08:11.460 --> 08:13.780]  This bit's a bit that we should drop. This is a bad bit.
[08:14.420 --> 08:15.940]  Whose more boring bit is
[08:15.940 --> 08:17.220]  a bad bit? It's not a bit!
[08:18.240 --> 08:20.240]  It's not good. It's not a bit!
[08:20.340 --> 08:21.940]  I'm more boring than he is. Eric, it's the hands
[08:21.940 --> 08:24.020]  we've been dealt. I have the lamest fucking life
[08:24.020 --> 08:24.980]  and I refuse
[08:25.860 --> 08:28.020]  to sit here and be told that Gavin's life
[08:28.020 --> 08:30.000]  is lamer than mine. You can mute and I'll just wave
[08:30.000 --> 08:31.760]  my arms when we're fucking done with this part.
[08:31.800 --> 08:33.440]  It's not a lame off, it's just a bore off.
[08:34.780 --> 08:35.500]  Boring is lame.
[08:35.780 --> 08:37.620]  You threw 44.
[08:37.820 --> 08:38.540]  44. Yeah.
[08:40.060 --> 08:41.180]  The goal was 80.
[08:41.820 --> 08:43.620]  Could you do 60 this year?
[08:43.760 --> 08:45.840]  Yeah. How much time
[08:45.840 --> 08:46.980]  do you need and then we'll
[08:47.760 --> 08:49.840]  get out there again. Is the shoulder more or less
[08:49.840 --> 08:50.900]  seized up than it was then?
[08:50.900 --> 08:51.740]  I'm...
[08:52.220 --> 08:53.840]  I'm at like...
[08:55.320 --> 08:56.700]  I'm trying to categorize.
[08:56.780 --> 08:59.120]  What happened last time is that he was gonna do it
[08:59.120 --> 09:00.520]  and then he got back arthritis.
[09:02.380 --> 09:03.340]  I'm doing...
[09:03.340 --> 09:03.940]  Oh, you know what?
[09:04.600 --> 09:06.800]  Oh shit, there's a four alarm house fire
[09:06.800 --> 09:08.220]  in Arden Heights, New York.
[09:09.480 --> 09:10.840]  Got the notification on my phone.
[09:13.420 --> 09:14.900]  What if you held out
[09:14.900 --> 09:16.160]  your arm and
[09:16.840 --> 09:18.740]  we just drove a van into it
[09:18.740 --> 09:19.840]  with a mattress on the front.
[09:21.980 --> 09:22.780]  I think
[09:22.780 --> 09:25.180]  I could get to 60. I'm like...
[09:25.180 --> 09:26.280]  with the exception of an ankle
[09:26.820 --> 09:28.920]  issue, I'm at like 95%.
[09:28.920 --> 09:30.740]  I don't understand where 60 is coming from.
[09:31.000 --> 09:32.920]  60 miles an hour. Gavin said could I throw 60 this year.
[09:33.100 --> 09:34.820]  It's halfway between where he threw and where he
[09:34.820 --> 09:36.460]  needs to be. Okay, so
[09:36.460 --> 09:38.780]  we're seeing if he can still not get to
[09:38.780 --> 09:40.600]  where he said he could. We're working our way up.
[09:41.100 --> 09:42.760]  Yeah. Gavin's idea
[09:42.760 --> 09:44.680]  is to get to 80.
[09:44.880 --> 09:45.420]  You gotta iterate.
[09:45.420 --> 09:46.780]  You gotta iterate.
[09:46.780 --> 09:49.220]  It wasn't built in a day.
[09:49.540 --> 09:51.320]  I want Geoff to win this. I think
[09:51.320 --> 09:53.040]  we need to set a new line. I think 60.
[09:53.500 --> 09:55.420]  I'll get to 60 and then when I get to 60
[09:55.420 --> 09:57.760]  that's the milestone I'll hit and then we'll
[09:57.760 --> 09:59.020]  evaluate from there.
[09:59.180 --> 10:01.100]  And I think we'll bin that little radar gun
[10:01.100 --> 10:02.380]  because who knows if that was accurate.
[10:02.660 --> 10:05.280]  It was. When do you want to
[10:05.280 --> 10:07.380]  throw? You think the radar gun was broken and that's
[10:07.380 --> 10:08.160]  why Geoff threw 44.
[10:09.600 --> 10:11.340]  You think that the radar gun
[10:11.340 --> 10:13.280]  was broken. I don't know if we were using it properly.
[10:13.280 --> 10:15.060]  Yeah, is it measuring his arm?
[10:15.140 --> 10:16.760]  Is it measuring the ball? How do we know what it sees?
[10:17.720 --> 10:19.200]  When do you want to throw the baseball?
[10:19.400 --> 10:21.060]  When do you think that you want
[10:21.060 --> 10:23.360]  the first week of May? It is
[10:23.360 --> 10:25.320]  February 17th for everyone at home.
[10:25.500 --> 10:26.700]  It is February 17th right now.
[10:26.900 --> 10:29.400]  I just want you to know, Gavin, I really like you
[10:29.400 --> 10:31.020]  right now. I really appreciate you right now.
[10:31.220 --> 10:33.420]  I like having you on my side. We're a good team.
[10:35.180 --> 10:36.940]  I'm pretty pro-Gavin right now.
[10:37.460 --> 10:39.260]  I'm a big fan. When do you think you could
[10:39.260 --> 10:39.720]  throw 60?
[10:41.580 --> 10:41.940]  Here's
[10:41.940 --> 10:42.740]  what I think we need to do.
[10:43.120 --> 10:44.920]  I think we need to set a new baseline.
[10:46.120 --> 10:47.620]  And we'll double verify it.
[10:47.680 --> 10:49.860]  We'll use the shitty gun that we have and Gavin's
[10:49.860 --> 10:51.680]  science method and see if
[10:51.680 --> 10:53.700]  we can determine if they're roughly the
[10:53.700 --> 10:55.680]  same. Then we'll know. And then we'll know
[10:55.680 --> 10:57.620]  what I'm actually throwing at. Because I might already be
[10:57.620 --> 10:59.560]  at 60. You're not. I might have been
[10:59.560 --> 11:01.360]  at 60 that day and the gun
[11:01.880 --> 11:03.220]  malfunctioned. Eric didn't even go.
[11:04.580 --> 11:05.700]  How do you know what you threw?
[11:05.860 --> 11:07.140]  Because it's not 60.
[11:08.440 --> 11:09.380]  I think we need
[11:09.380 --> 11:11.220]  to set a new baseline in
[11:11.220 --> 11:12.780]  2023 because I might already be there.
[11:13.060 --> 11:14.080]  I've been lifting weights.
[11:14.740 --> 11:17.180]  Not to interject too much with you.
[11:17.260 --> 11:19.300]  I know you're trying to schedule Eric. We should do this
[11:19.300 --> 11:21.200]  at the same time. You guys have been talking about wanting
[11:21.200 --> 11:23.080]  to throw fruit to see what fruit
[11:23.080 --> 11:24.200]  could be thrown the furthest.
[11:24.980 --> 11:27.120]  You could do both of these things at the same time.
[11:27.520 --> 11:28.660]  F***face has a toss!
[11:30.440 --> 11:31.340]  I want to get
[11:31.340 --> 11:33.220]  the toss off. I want to get
[11:33.900 --> 11:34.880]  one thing done.
[11:35.880 --> 11:36.860]  For this show
[11:36.860 --> 11:38.700]  I simply want to do one thing.
[11:38.720 --> 11:41.100]  I think we've been pretty good at doing things recently.
[11:41.480 --> 11:42.280]  We've done some things.
[11:42.300 --> 11:43.920]  We've done so much supplemental content.
[11:44.180 --> 11:47.080]  Andrew and I filmed a whole secret podcast yesterday.
[11:47.260 --> 11:48.300]  Can I ask again?
[11:48.880 --> 11:49.080]  When?
[11:50.340 --> 11:51.740]  What's today? February 17th?
[11:51.860 --> 11:55.280]  God, I'm looking at Eric thumb through his calendar. It's a shitshow.
[11:55.640 --> 11:56.800]  Look at that. That's ugly.
[11:56.960 --> 11:57.460]  It's all the time.
[11:58.560 --> 12:01.120]  If you printed each page of that, you could make a piece of art.
[12:01.320 --> 12:02.560]  When does baseball start?
[12:02.560 --> 12:03.780]  What's opening day?
[12:04.080 --> 12:05.120]  April 7th?
[12:05.160 --> 12:07.720]  No, it's the end of March. They moved it up.
[12:08.860 --> 12:10.000]  Let's do it on opening day.
[12:10.580 --> 12:11.880]  You want to do what on opening day?
[12:11.900 --> 12:13.220]  I'll set a new baseline.
[12:13.740 --> 12:15.380]  You're going to set a new baseline on opening day.
[12:15.380 --> 12:17.580]  The day that I want to watch baseball.
[12:17.720 --> 12:19.080]  You're going to watch me throw a baseball?
[12:19.960 --> 12:21.260]  What's more baseball than baseball?
[12:21.780 --> 12:24.880]  I'll get Padres opening day
[12:24.880 --> 12:25.640]  2023.
[12:25.980 --> 12:28.000]  Can we just drag a TV out and have it on?
[12:28.600 --> 12:30.300]  I'm definitely going to have it on my phone.
[12:30.300 --> 12:30.880]  Yeah, absolutely.
[12:32.240 --> 12:34.300]  Thursday, March 30th
[12:34.300 --> 12:35.880]  at 110pm against the...
[12:35.880 --> 12:37.860]  The Padres host the Colorado Rockies.
[12:38.000 --> 12:39.500]  Oh, that's great. We'll do it that morning.
[12:39.840 --> 12:42.100]  We'll throw a baseball, set a baseline,
[12:42.440 --> 12:43.880]  celebrate with breakfast, and then we'll
[12:43.880 --> 12:45.960]  release Eric to go watch baseball.
[12:46.380 --> 12:48.180]  Then we'll return and film f***face
[12:48.180 --> 12:48.640]  in the afternoon.
[12:50.440 --> 12:51.480]  F***face tossers.
[12:53.440 --> 12:54.480]  Add people.
[12:54.820 --> 12:55.320]  Geoff?
[12:55.620 --> 12:56.900]  And then we'll get our fruit going.
[12:56.900 --> 12:58.660]  I found a f***ing awesome apple.
[12:59.000 --> 13:00.240]  Andrew, I'm going to add you.
[13:00.540 --> 13:01.880]  Even though you're not necessarily...
[13:01.880 --> 13:04.440]  I just want you to have...
[13:04.440 --> 13:05.100]  Full visibility.
[13:05.540 --> 13:06.900]  Yeah, have a real look at it.
[13:07.200 --> 13:09.140]  Nick, I'm putting it on your calendar as well.
[13:12.000 --> 13:12.900]  F***face tossers.
[13:13.040 --> 13:13.980]  10-11am.
[13:14.060 --> 13:16.000]  We can go longer if we need to.
[13:16.160 --> 13:19.200]  On Thursday, the 30th.
[13:19.480 --> 13:19.760]  Sweet.
[13:20.240 --> 13:21.480]  Great. Perfect.
[13:21.500 --> 13:23.540]  One thing down.
[13:24.540 --> 13:25.580]  Boom. Yes.
[13:26.200 --> 13:26.660]  Locked in.
[13:28.060 --> 13:28.720]  Gavin's going to put maybe.
[13:29.300 --> 13:31.880]  I'm not a maybe putter. I'm a nothing or a yes.
[13:32.220 --> 13:33.180]  In the same way.
[13:34.860 --> 13:35.500]  Maybe doesn't...
[13:35.500 --> 13:36.500]  It's not doing anything for me.
[13:36.580 --> 13:37.920]  Maybe it's just a middle finger.
[13:39.640 --> 13:42.040]  Maybe just says, I acknowledge that you sent me this.
[13:42.540 --> 13:43.720]  And you know that I've seen it.
[13:44.200 --> 13:45.700]  I'm not going to give you any useful information
[13:45.700 --> 13:47.680]  about what I'm going to do with it,
[13:47.760 --> 13:49.140]  but I am letting you know I saw it.
[13:49.500 --> 13:51.540]  Okay, so we're going to have a baseline
[13:51.540 --> 13:52.640]  for when you throw the ball.
[13:53.040 --> 13:55.620]  And then you're saying in three months after that
[13:55.620 --> 13:57.160]  you can all-star break?
[13:57.300 --> 13:59.740]  I think, well, let's see where we are.
[13:59.920 --> 14:00.740]  It's hard to determine.
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.820]  If I'm at 30, it might be hard
[14:04.500 --> 14:05.960]  to get there in three months.
[14:06.220 --> 14:06.720]  Get to 60.
[14:06.900 --> 14:09.700]  If I'm already at 60, then there's no point in doing it again.
[14:09.780 --> 14:10.620]  I'll just go straight for 80.
[14:11.120 --> 14:13.060]  Okay. Sounds good.
[14:14.040 --> 14:16.320]  We'll aim for marked improvement
[14:17.200 --> 14:19.340]  90 days after that throw.
[14:19.360 --> 14:20.120]  That's what I'm looking for.
[14:21.440 --> 14:22.080]  Marked improvement.
[14:22.580 --> 14:24.140]  Even if it's me getting from like
[14:24.720 --> 14:25.860]  78 to 81.
[14:26.280 --> 14:27.940]  Or whatever. If that's all I can muster.
[14:28.340 --> 14:29.320]  Because I'm already at the top.
[14:30.360 --> 14:31.740]  You think? Okay, whatever.
[14:31.900 --> 14:33.580]  It's not even worth having the conversation. It doesn't matter.
[14:33.840 --> 14:36.400]  Andrew, thank you. That's a good bit that we can pick up.
[14:36.800 --> 14:37.700]  Next one? Yeah.
[14:37.860 --> 14:38.460]  The chip-off.
[14:39.200 --> 14:39.980]  We need to do a chip-off.
[14:41.720 --> 14:43.780]  We got the vagina and the penis
[14:43.780 --> 14:44.600]  flavored chips.
[14:44.840 --> 14:47.920]  I mean, that could be a side thing.
[14:47.920 --> 14:49.760]  Within that, I'm not putting that as one of my chips.
[14:50.800 --> 14:51.780]  I think the original idea was
[14:51.780 --> 14:53.300]  that each would submit three flavors
[14:53.840 --> 14:55.740]  and then we'd determine who had the best selection.
[14:56.100 --> 14:57.900]  I think the issue here mainly is
[14:57.900 --> 15:00.140]  logistically, how do we get all the chips to everyone?
[15:00.420 --> 15:01.700]  Are we going to try and do that in person?
[15:01.800 --> 15:03.080]  Or are we going to try and do that...
[15:03.080 --> 15:05.900]  No, I think it should be an episode. I don't think it should be
[15:05.900 --> 15:07.820]  supplemental content. I do think it should be an episode.
[15:08.260 --> 15:10.240]  I think that we'll...
[15:10.240 --> 15:11.940]  I'll have to order them.
[15:12.540 --> 15:14.100]  So everybody needs to get you a list
[15:14.100 --> 15:15.920]  of their chips. And then you'll figure out
[15:15.920 --> 15:17.800]  how to get it to everybody. Five each, right?
[15:18.080 --> 15:19.560]  Yeah, five each. And then...
[15:19.560 --> 15:21.920]  I'll write that down. I'll work with...
[15:22.560 --> 15:24.400]  And I represent America in this, right?
[15:24.420 --> 15:25.980]  Yeah. I have to get an associate producer.
[15:26.180 --> 15:27.360]  I can get someone to help me with this.
[15:27.680 --> 15:29.400]  I just don't have time to do it.
[15:29.600 --> 15:32.360]  Top of the line...
[15:32.360 --> 15:34.340]  A plus...
[15:34.340 --> 15:35.720]  Do you think Stacey has time or no?
[15:36.140 --> 15:36.840]  Yeah, probably.
[15:37.440 --> 15:38.220]  I'll see if she can help.
[15:39.300 --> 15:41.280]  I can get an associate producer to help me with this.
[15:41.360 --> 15:43.360]  I can get everything sent. We can budget against it.
[15:43.980 --> 15:45.240]  We're going to have to import stuff
[15:46.060 --> 15:48.140]  from England and then send it to Canada.
[15:48.180 --> 15:50.520]  But I can do that directly, I think.
[15:50.600 --> 15:50.780]  Okay.
[15:50.840 --> 15:52.760]  Instead of sending it here and then sending it out,
[15:52.820 --> 15:54.700]  I would just send it directly to Andrew.
[15:54.920 --> 15:56.800]  This could potentially be more expensive than you think,
[15:56.960 --> 15:58.980]  but hopefully we have the credit card.
[15:59.140 --> 16:01.180]  It is going to be a lot more expensive.
[16:01.900 --> 16:02.860]  I mean, it's not...
[16:02.860 --> 16:04.800]  It's going to be a price point that is not worth it,
[16:04.840 --> 16:05.600]  but we're going to do it.
[16:05.700 --> 16:06.560]  Hell yeah, we're going to do it.
[16:08.600 --> 16:09.820]  Hell yeah, it's really expensive.
[16:11.600 --> 16:12.400]  Okay, cool.
[16:12.580 --> 16:14.060]  Then that's a good one. Thank you, Andrew.
[16:14.220 --> 16:14.900]  That's a good one.
[16:15.280 --> 16:16.620]  If Rooster Teeth came to us and said,
[16:17.540 --> 16:19.680]  your potato chip bet is too expensive,
[16:20.840 --> 16:21.200]  I...
[16:22.680 --> 16:24.380]  Oh no, we'll be fine.
[16:24.780 --> 16:27.120]  No one else here is going to have to hear about it.
[16:27.260 --> 16:28.580]  It's just going to be people talking to me
[16:28.580 --> 16:29.680]  and I'm going to go, don't worry about it.
[16:29.760 --> 16:31.680]  As a company that had a show
[16:31.680 --> 16:33.300]  based around chips,
[16:33.500 --> 16:35.440]  if we can't do our own chip bet, I'll be livid.
[16:35.720 --> 16:36.440]  Yeah, there you go.
[16:36.440 --> 16:37.280]  There you have it.
[16:37.840 --> 16:39.120]  Okay, Andrew, next?
[16:39.680 --> 16:42.080]  Next one is tuxedo photoshoot.
[16:42.400 --> 16:43.400]  Recreating the poster.
[16:43.780 --> 16:45.560]  Gotta do the photoshoot.
[16:46.160 --> 16:47.840]  I can work with Cameron
[16:48.800 --> 16:50.320]  I can work with Cameron
[16:50.320 --> 16:52.400]  to find time to shoot something
[16:52.400 --> 16:54.160]  in the next...
[16:54.160 --> 16:55.720]  God, I'll work with you
[16:56.920 --> 16:58.520]  It's just a still though, isn't it?
[16:58.520 --> 16:59.940]  Yeah, the next two weeks.
[17:00.320 --> 17:02.240]  You're going to be Jackie Chan
[17:02.240 --> 17:03.460]  and I'll be Jennifer Love Hewitt
[17:03.460 --> 17:05.600]  and then we'll have Andrew somewhere in the picture
[17:06.580 --> 17:06.980]  represented.
[17:07.120 --> 17:08.860]  On the foot of the kick or something?
[17:09.060 --> 17:09.380]  I don't know.
[17:11.020 --> 17:13.580]  Yeah, because we'll put this on the bottom of it, right?
[17:14.000 --> 17:15.360]  Yeah. The VCK?
[17:15.560 --> 17:15.720]  Yeah.
[17:17.500 --> 17:19.260]  Maybe he could be like...
[17:20.060 --> 17:21.200]  opaque in the background.
[17:22.560 --> 17:22.960]  Like...
[17:22.960 --> 17:23.820]  Obi-Wan Kenobi
[17:23.820 --> 17:26.080]  in a new outfit.
[17:28.740 --> 17:29.380]  Okay, cool.
[17:29.560 --> 17:30.720]  I ping Cameron
[17:30.720 --> 17:32.520]  and he'll be able to shoot the photo.
[17:32.860 --> 17:33.900]  If we could get...
[17:33.900 --> 17:35.200]  I know it's not...
[17:36.640 --> 17:38.520]  I know it's not Cameron with the photo
[17:39.020 --> 17:40.320]  but if we could get him a costume
[17:40.320 --> 17:41.740]  Andrew could be the water strider.
[17:42.440 --> 17:43.340]  Just like a bug?
[17:45.440 --> 17:46.840]  Put him in a bug costume?
[17:47.840 --> 17:48.940]  On his back?
[17:50.120 --> 17:50.840]  Little wings?
[17:51.040 --> 17:52.500]  You don't want to dress up as a bug, Andrew?
[17:52.700 --> 17:54.400]  No, I don't want to be the water strider.
[17:54.620 --> 17:55.000]  Why not?
[17:55.740 --> 17:56.920]  That's a terrible role.
[17:57.480 --> 17:58.920]  Hey, while we're scheduling
[18:00.040 --> 18:01.660]  since we're having such a great time with this
[18:01.660 --> 18:03.820]  not to jump on Andrew's bit
[18:03.820 --> 18:05.240]  but could we schedule a Condor Man 2
[18:05.240 --> 18:06.240]  just so we have that?
[18:06.360 --> 18:08.180]  So here's the thing. You brought it up earlier.
[18:08.380 --> 18:10.920]  Is that what we're doing? Are we doing Condor Man?
[18:11.140 --> 18:11.340]  Yeah.
[18:11.800 --> 18:14.380]  Okay, I didn't feel like we had landed on
[18:14.380 --> 18:15.180]  yes, we're doing this.
[18:15.180 --> 18:16.780]  I think there's an expectation with the audience.
[18:18.320 --> 18:20.100]  Trust me when I say
[18:20.660 --> 18:23.100]  I don't care about the expectation with the audience.
[18:23.680 --> 18:25.060]  When it comes to
[18:25.060 --> 18:27.160]  what things we feel like
[18:27.160 --> 18:28.980]  we're on the hook for. We should dictate
[18:28.980 --> 18:30.160]  what we want to do.
[18:31.120 --> 18:32.800]  And I want to make the ice cream.
[18:33.240 --> 18:34.240]  Because we talked about
[18:34.700 --> 18:36.020]  making the Condor Man crunch.
[18:36.840 --> 18:38.280]  Making the Condor Man ice cream.
[18:39.120 --> 18:40.860]  And we talked about making it
[18:40.860 --> 18:41.900]  hand cranking ice cream.
[18:42.440 --> 18:44.960]  So, if I'm looking at a Friday
[18:45.920 --> 18:47.200]  a third... let me keep going.
[18:47.440 --> 18:49.060]  I love every time I talk about cool food
[18:49.060 --> 18:50.360]  I look over at Nick and he's like, yeah.
[18:51.720 --> 18:52.640]  You don't know
[18:52.640 --> 18:54.420]  this guy on face jam
[18:55.480 --> 18:56.560]  he's like a
[18:56.560 --> 18:57.220]  gremlin.
[18:59.360 --> 19:00.640]  That's why I won't allow him
[19:00.640 --> 19:02.340]  to take the most normal person in the room.
[19:02.700 --> 19:04.060]  But here's the thing.
[19:04.600 --> 19:06.600]  You're saying outside of this stuff
[19:06.600 --> 19:08.460]  you're the most normal person. Outside
[19:08.460 --> 19:10.080]  of what Nick does here
[19:10.490 --> 19:12.420]  he, I think, is the most regular
[19:12.420 --> 19:14.300]  dude in the world.
[19:14.600 --> 19:16.460]  The problem is when we start going to
[19:16.460 --> 19:18.580]  Schlotzky's and he goes, you know they're owned by
[19:18.580 --> 19:20.460]  Cinnabon, right? And I don't even want
[19:20.460 --> 19:22.280]  a Cinnabon. What would it even look like if we got one?
[19:22.380 --> 19:24.520]  What if I ate... what would a Cinnabon even
[19:24.520 --> 19:25.040]  taste like?
[19:26.020 --> 19:28.500]  You wouldn't dare me to eat four Cinnabons right now.
[19:28.940 --> 19:29.720]  That's crazy.
[19:30.360 --> 19:31.760]  It's just that you go
[19:33.620 --> 19:34.100]  okay...
[19:34.100 --> 19:36.540]  I do agree. I think Nick is a regulation dude.
[19:36.700 --> 19:37.360]  Yeah, absolutely.
[19:38.340 --> 19:39.620]  The 10th of March
[19:40.160 --> 19:41.480]  is a Friday. Okay.
[19:42.280 --> 19:44.360]  1pm, our time. Let me see.
[19:44.660 --> 19:46.360]  Okay. Check my calendar. Gavin's
[19:46.360 --> 19:48.520]  not even bothering. Oh, now he is.
[19:49.980 --> 19:50.460]  Didn't...
[19:50.460 --> 19:52.100]  He's not bothering. He's just pretending to look.
[19:52.700 --> 19:54.520]  He was looking straight ahead
[19:54.520 --> 19:56.420]  at Geoff. Which day of March?
[19:56.640 --> 19:58.760]  10th. Friday. Friday, March 10th.
[19:58.980 --> 20:00.500]  2023. Pretty
[20:00.500 --> 20:02.600]  open for me. Pretty open for me. Andrew?
[20:03.120 --> 20:03.860]  Pretty open for Nick.
[20:04.340 --> 20:05.060]  What are we doing?
[20:06.780 --> 20:08.220]  What are we talking about?
[20:08.240 --> 20:09.960]  How? How? Why? How?
[20:10.260 --> 20:11.460]  What the... Come on!
[20:11.780 --> 20:13.900]  I forgot what we were talking about.
[20:14.320 --> 20:16.180]  Oh my... God!
[20:19.040 --> 20:20.000]  Oh, Condor Man!
[20:20.160 --> 20:21.940]  I remember Condor Man. Yeah, good.
[20:22.140 --> 20:24.460]  Thumbs up. You fucking ran Gavin out of the room.
[20:25.100 --> 20:26.360]  No, I just forgot what we were
[20:26.360 --> 20:28.620]  talking about. Because I was looking at the list. I was thinking about
[20:28.620 --> 20:30.140]  some of the upcoming things. Right, right, right.
[20:30.200 --> 20:32.420]  No, I understand. You were thinking two or three
[20:32.420 --> 20:33.840]  moves ahead. I was.
[20:34.180 --> 20:35.420]  Yeah, I understand. Absolutely.
[20:36.760 --> 20:38.560]  I'm in. Alright, well...
[20:38.560 --> 20:39.460]  You're in for what?
[20:40.380 --> 20:42.140]  The date and time that you stated.
[20:42.420 --> 20:44.560]  And what... I'm sorry, just to
[20:44.560 --> 20:46.580]  remind me, what would that be?
[20:47.860 --> 20:48.760]  Go ahead and just
[20:48.760 --> 20:50.840]  go ahead and hit me with it one time.
[20:50.960 --> 20:52.800]  The date and the time that I gave.
[20:52.940 --> 20:54.710]  Hit me, Andrew, one more time. Yeah, go ahead.
[20:56.820 --> 20:57.240]  Uh...
[20:57.240 --> 20:58.080]  Uh...
[20:59.320 --> 21:00.160]  10 AM?
[21:00.820 --> 21:01.480]  My time?
[21:01.860 --> 21:04.360]  10 AM your time on what was the date?
[21:06.340 --> 21:06.760]  March...
[21:07.740 --> 21:08.160]  22nd?
[21:08.240 --> 21:08.920]  Yeah, that's right.
[21:09.240 --> 21:12.400]  Yeah, that's what the fuck I said.
[21:12.760 --> 21:14.100]  Yep. Gavin had
[21:14.100 --> 21:15.900]  an empty day in March, right?
[21:16.040 --> 21:17.900]  I was reading... I'm in. Whatever.
[21:18.420 --> 21:20.240]  I'm committed. March 10th, buddy.
[21:20.260 --> 21:21.900]  Go team. We'll see you March 10th. Go team.
[21:22.080 --> 21:23.320]  March 10th? Oh, wow.
[21:25.000 --> 21:26.040]  The condors will
[21:26.040 --> 21:27.900]  fly. Wait, do I have something on March 10th?
[21:27.960 --> 21:29.340]  I'm just kidding.
[21:30.520 --> 21:31.600]  1 to 5 PM.
[21:31.820 --> 21:34.100]  So it's not 10 AM your time. It'll be 11 AM
[21:34.100 --> 21:36.020]  your time. So you have some time to sleep in,
[21:36.280 --> 21:38.000]  make some brekkies, and then get going.
[21:38.180 --> 21:39.180]  Make some ice cream.
[21:40.520 --> 21:41.760]  1 to 5 PM.
[21:41.760 --> 21:44.020]  We will do it like we did last time
[21:44.020 --> 21:44.580]  where
[21:45.660 --> 21:47.840]  I'll show the movie, we'll all be
[21:47.840 --> 21:49.420]  at home doing that stuff.
[21:49.960 --> 21:50.880]  Sounds good.
[21:51.420 --> 21:53.200]  Perfect. Fantastic.
[21:53.360 --> 21:53.640]  Excellent.
[21:55.740 --> 21:56.340]  Okay.
[21:57.700 --> 21:58.920]  Condorman is scheduled.
[21:59.740 --> 22:00.580]  Next on the list.
[22:02.220 --> 22:03.820]  I'm going to say yes to today's.
[22:04.800 --> 22:05.660]  There we go.
[22:06.000 --> 22:06.840]  Thanks, man.
[22:08.480 --> 22:10.080]  Face plays video games
[22:10.440 --> 22:11.820]  just as a thing we do.
[22:12.020 --> 22:13.980]  I like to do this. Like a Warzone
[22:13.980 --> 22:15.640]  thing. We should have a Warzone time.
[22:16.260 --> 22:17.360]  Now, here's my question.
[22:17.860 --> 22:20.100]  If we were to do that, if we were to
[22:20.100 --> 22:21.960]  film a Let's Play style video
[22:21.960 --> 22:24.220]  and us playing Warzone, whether it be 3s
[22:24.220 --> 22:25.060]  or 4s or whatever,
[22:26.120 --> 22:28.140]  do we create an edited Achievement
[22:28.140 --> 22:29.840]  Hunter video that we release?
[22:30.160 --> 22:32.180]  Or do we just stream it?
[22:32.340 --> 22:33.900]  And if people tune in to watch it?
[22:34.360 --> 22:35.260]  I think it should be a VOD.
[22:35.880 --> 22:37.300]  You think it should be a VOD? Okay.
[22:37.300 --> 22:39.720]  Yeah, because of different perspectives.
[22:40.040 --> 22:41.140]  Like if we're streaming, I don't know.
[22:41.340 --> 22:43.300]  Nothing boring about
[22:43.300 --> 22:45.280]  what's going on with Gavin's face right now.
[22:45.280 --> 22:46.020]  Oh, a little bit.
[22:47.520 --> 22:49.680]  He's got some popcorn in his beard.
[22:51.260 --> 22:52.960]  Okay, so we would film it.
[22:53.640 --> 22:54.900]  So I need a filming setup.
[22:56.080 --> 22:57.300]  Here's what I think.
[22:57.960 --> 22:58.840]  We stream it.
[22:59.400 --> 23:01.160]  We can archive it if we want to.
[23:01.560 --> 23:03.220]  We don't do it for multiple perspectives.
[23:03.640 --> 23:05.360]  You just have the one that somebody's streaming from.
[23:05.360 --> 23:06.720]  And you're good with that.
[23:07.160 --> 23:08.560]  If we start doing
[23:09.380 --> 23:11.440]  Achievement Hunter, which is, I don't know if you're familiar,
[23:11.540 --> 23:13.320]  a company that you started and now has
[23:13.320 --> 23:15.160]  become a much larger thing,
[23:15.240 --> 23:16.740]  then you're just doing it again.
[23:16.960 --> 23:18.720]  And I don't think it needs to become that.
[23:19.000 --> 23:20.080]  Oh, I don't want to do that.
[23:20.180 --> 23:23.320]  I think you just stream from the one perspective and then have it
[23:23.320 --> 23:24.840]  be the lobby where you guys are
[23:25.360 --> 23:27.080]  playing together. I think a VOD is way better.
[23:27.160 --> 23:28.320]  I'm less interested in that.
[23:28.660 --> 23:30.660]  Because we're not going to be shitting these out
[23:31.460 --> 23:32.460]  playing games every day.
[23:32.460 --> 23:34.140]  It's purposeful.
[23:34.340 --> 23:36.480]  We want to do this Warzone
[23:36.480 --> 23:37.800]  thing one time.
[23:38.040 --> 23:40.060]  So don't do it live, but record it and release it?
[23:40.180 --> 23:41.960]  Is that what you're saying? At some point, yes.
[23:42.120 --> 23:44.580]  I think it's just way better when you can cut between angles.
[23:45.140 --> 23:45.300]  Okay.
[23:46.700 --> 23:48.220]  But we're not establishing
[23:48.220 --> 23:49.760]  that we're a gaming channel.
[23:50.220 --> 23:51.400]  No, absolutely not.
[23:51.460 --> 23:54.000]  This is no different than us watching
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.120]  the Tuxedo or
[23:56.120 --> 23:56.920]  hitting baseballs.
[23:57.160 --> 23:59.880]  We reviewed Apples once. We don't do that all the time.
[23:59.880 --> 24:02.380]  So what's in that package right there?
[24:03.040 --> 24:04.500]  That's the fruits of our
[24:04.500 --> 24:05.620]  Apple labor.
[24:05.800 --> 24:08.020]  I don't agree. I will do this if you guys
[24:08.020 --> 24:09.900]  are saying that you think this is the best way to do it.
[24:10.120 --> 24:11.940]  I disagree that this is something that we should
[24:11.940 --> 24:12.880]  be doing. Okay.
[24:13.320 --> 24:16.000]  That's it. I can do it.
[24:16.080 --> 24:18.140]  We can do it. I'm not for it.
[24:18.180 --> 24:19.780]  Here's the deal. We'll put a pin in that one.
[24:20.360 --> 24:21.740]  No, no. It's fine. We can figure it out.
[24:21.820 --> 24:23.220]  We can get it scheduled. We can do it.
[24:23.360 --> 24:25.900]  My question to you, Gavin, specifically
[24:25.900 --> 24:28.280]  is if we're going to make this at some point
[24:28.280 --> 24:30.620]  however we decide to make it, whether we just stream it
[24:31.040 --> 24:31.980]  like Eric's idea
[24:31.980 --> 24:34.360]  or we make a VOD like your idea, will you help
[24:34.360 --> 24:36.080]  me set up my computer and stuff?
[24:36.740 --> 24:38.220]  Uh, yeah. I need to connect
[24:38.220 --> 24:40.300]  an Xbox into it. Why don't we just do it here?
[24:40.720 --> 24:42.340]  Okay. I have
[24:42.340 --> 24:44.420]  no problem with any of this. I can get this set up.
[24:45.060 --> 24:46.220]  And Andrew's set up, we can
[24:46.220 --> 24:48.260]  either do the thing where you plug in
[24:48.260 --> 24:50.360]  an external drive to the Xbox and just capture
[24:50.360 --> 24:52.260]  to that directly from the
[24:52.260 --> 24:54.140]  Xbox. You can do that. Or we can get
[24:54.140 --> 24:56.220]  a capture set up, which will be more
[24:56.220 --> 24:58.100]  effort, but either way, we can just
[24:58.620 --> 25:00.060]  get his footage that way.
[25:00.340 --> 25:01.940]  Okay. We can
[25:02.360 --> 25:04.220]  Sounds like something we should continue to
[25:04.220 --> 25:05.900]  talk about. I don't like that Eric doesn't like it.
[25:06.140 --> 25:08.340]  I don't like doing stuff that Eric doesn't like. I'm for
[25:08.340 --> 25:10.080]  it if you guys want to do it, but I
[25:10.080 --> 25:11.640]  really want to make it known that
[25:11.640 --> 25:14.360]  if you're asking if this
[25:14.360 --> 25:16.000]  is the direction that we should be
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.500]  doing this type of stuff, I don't
[25:18.500 --> 25:19.680]  think so. I think
[25:20.140 --> 25:22.280]  releasing a VOD that's a single perspective
[25:22.280 --> 25:24.320]  is the way to go, but it doesn't matter
[25:24.320 --> 25:26.480]  to me. That's all. I'll
[25:26.480 --> 25:28.480]  be honest, it doesn't really matter to me either. I just want to play
[25:28.480 --> 25:29.940]  Call of Duty with you all. Totally!
[25:30.120 --> 25:32.300]  And when we played Call of Duty the other
[25:32.300 --> 25:34.120]  night, it was 100% content.
[25:34.660 --> 25:36.180]  And it was good content. And so if we're gonna
[25:36.180 --> 25:38.340]  be playing it, and it is content,
[25:38.440 --> 25:39.780]  we might as well find a way to share that.
[25:40.280 --> 25:42.160]  On occasion. Without creating any
[25:42.160 --> 25:44.380]  expectations that Geoff is going
[25:44.380 --> 25:46.400]  to be a professionally
[25:46.400 --> 25:48.280]  bad video game player again,
[25:48.400 --> 25:49.280]  which he is not.
[25:50.380 --> 25:52.260]  That's not my life anymore. I think that's where you
[25:52.260 --> 25:54.140]  start. This is
[25:54.140 --> 25:55.360]  to me where it starts getting fuzzy.
[25:56.560 --> 25:57.860]  Where you're saying like,
[25:58.160 --> 26:00.000]  oh, I'm not setting any expectations.
[26:00.580 --> 26:02.160]  We, as deliberate
[26:02.160 --> 26:04.160]  as we're being, we cannot do that.
[26:04.440 --> 26:05.780]  Yeah, but we don't, like we've
[26:05.780 --> 26:08.040]  commented on two movies. I understand.
[26:08.440 --> 26:10.280]  And then what's the expectation?
[26:10.620 --> 26:12.200]  What's the next one? Oh, here's another movie they
[26:12.200 --> 26:14.240]  should do. Here's another one they should do. Here's the next thing.
[26:14.300 --> 26:15.820]  We just said that we don't care about
[26:16.360 --> 26:18.140]  expectation. Like we just, we do the thing
[26:18.140 --> 26:20.260]  that we want to do. This has just come from the games that we're
[26:20.260 --> 26:22.180]  playing in our personal lives and having
[26:22.180 --> 26:24.080]  fun very occasionally. I
[26:24.080 --> 26:26.220]  understand that. We understand
[26:26.220 --> 26:28.260]  that. I'm talking about all of
[26:28.260 --> 26:30.200]  the people listening to this who are
[26:30.200 --> 26:32.560]  definitely not involved in this conversation
[26:32.560 --> 26:34.300]  but are still going to have that
[26:34.300 --> 26:36.400]  expectation regardless. And that's
[26:36.400 --> 26:38.320]  fine if that's what we want to do.
[26:38.400 --> 26:40.280]  If we want to play these games and do this
[26:40.280 --> 26:42.300]  stuff, let's do it. I will help
[26:42.300 --> 26:43.980]  facilitate. I'll produce it. I'll put it together.
[26:44.140 --> 26:46.260]  That's fine. My issue is that
[26:46.260 --> 26:48.460]  I do think that it's going to
[26:48.460 --> 26:50.720]  only get the conversation
[26:50.720 --> 26:52.840]  going in that direction
[26:52.840 --> 26:54.520]  from now on. I wish...
[26:54.520 --> 26:56.740]  Here's the next thing they should play. How come they're not playing this?
[26:56.920 --> 26:58.540]  Here's the other game. How come we're
[26:58.540 --> 26:59.820]  not commentating on X movie?
[27:00.360 --> 27:02.400]  I wish we had a camera
[27:02.400 --> 27:04.380]  just on Gavin eating this popcorn.
[27:04.760 --> 27:05.440]  You're seeing this, right?
[27:05.760 --> 27:07.680]  You're watching what's going on with Gavin and the popcorn? Okay.
[27:08.160 --> 27:08.760]  It's hideous.
[27:11.260 --> 27:12.600]  It's disgusting what you're
[27:12.600 --> 27:14.400]  doing with that popcorn. I'm trying not to drop it
[27:14.400 --> 27:15.880]  into my beard so I'm having to like
[27:16.640 --> 27:17.920]  It's so fucking gross
[27:17.920 --> 27:19.880]  what you're doing. You make food
[27:19.880 --> 27:20.300]  gross.
[27:22.660 --> 27:23.900]  We will find a time
[27:23.900 --> 27:25.820]  to talk about when we can get this set up so we can get
[27:25.820 --> 27:27.860]  Andrew set up. Your guys's, we can get it
[27:27.860 --> 27:29.640]  all recorded and good to go. Here's the deal.
[27:29.740 --> 27:31.900]  At the end of the day, Eric is the
[27:31.900 --> 27:33.600]  producer of this show and I trust him.
[27:34.020 --> 27:35.780]  And so, even if I don't always
[27:35.780 --> 27:37.260]  agree necessarily, I trust Eric.
[27:37.480 --> 27:39.860]  But if you guys are saying that this is the thing that you want
[27:39.860 --> 27:41.860]  to do, I'm not going to be the one
[27:41.860 --> 27:43.760]  to put my foot down and say, no you're not. I'm going to say
[27:43.760 --> 27:45.760]  here's how I feel, let me help
[27:45.760 --> 27:47.840]  you do the thing that you want to do. So that's it.
[27:48.420 --> 27:49.800]  As long as I'm heard, then I don't
[27:49.800 --> 27:51.320]  care. I don't think you're necessarily
[27:52.000 --> 27:53.980]  like, I agree with you, I just don't think Warzone
[27:53.980 --> 27:55.620]  is a game that that would translate well with.
[27:56.060 --> 27:57.860]  Like, I think for other things if we wanted to do it
[27:57.860 --> 27:59.760]  it would be perfect, but I just don't think Warzone would make
[27:59.760 --> 28:01.380]  sense for how that game is structured. Okay.
[28:01.840 --> 28:03.680]  Gavin keeps looking at me side-eyed eating popcorn
[28:03.680 --> 28:04.360]  in his beard.
[28:06.940 --> 28:07.780]  Gavin's decided that
[28:07.780 --> 28:09.760]  instead of being embarrassed by having popcorn in
[28:09.760 --> 28:11.700]  his beard, he's going to make sure that nobody ever
[28:11.700 --> 28:12.640]  eats popcorn in his beard.
[28:14.040 --> 28:15.840]  By making it look so disgusting
[28:15.840 --> 28:17.560]  to ingest. Okay, we'll
[28:17.560 --> 28:19.600]  look at playing Warzone soon.
[28:20.560 --> 28:21.760]  Andrew, what's the next thing?
[28:22.820 --> 28:23.840]  The issue with streaming is
[28:23.840 --> 28:25.160]  Okay, go ahead.
[28:25.420 --> 28:27.080]  If someone dies,
[28:27.740 --> 28:29.020]  gets sent to the gulag,
[28:30.420 --> 28:31.900]  you're not watching the game anymore.
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.780]  You're watching, you know, if we both
[28:33.780 --> 28:35.920]  die and you're streaming from one of our point of views and Andrew's,
[28:36.560 --> 28:37.760]  it's way better if we can cut to
[28:37.760 --> 28:39.420]  who's playing. Are you still talking about this? Yes.
[28:39.420 --> 28:41.340]  There also is a bug,
[28:41.440 --> 28:43.480]  I don't know if they fixed it, where like you would be
[28:43.480 --> 28:45.420]  forced to spectate other teams?
[28:45.780 --> 28:47.560]  There'd be a scenario
[28:47.560 --> 28:49.520]  in which we couldn't watch ourselves play.
[28:49.640 --> 28:51.400]  That'd be crazy. Dude, my favorite thing about
[28:51.400 --> 28:53.480]  Warzone 1 was Emily and I would
[28:54.060 --> 28:55.560]  she would watch. She loves to watch
[28:55.560 --> 28:56.920]  Warzone. It's like her favorite thing to do.
[28:57.200 --> 28:59.000]  She'll ask me to play Warzone just so she can watch.
[28:59.280 --> 29:01.080]  And then what we do is I die, obviously.
[29:01.520 --> 29:03.580]  Play solos, right? Start with 150
[29:03.580 --> 29:05.320]  people. Maybe I make it to 20.
[29:05.940 --> 29:07.500]  Probably, maybe 15 if I'm
[29:07.500 --> 29:09.640]  lucky. But probably not. Probably in the 30s or the 40s.
[29:09.960 --> 29:11.200]  And then it just cuts to the next person.
[29:11.400 --> 29:13.460]  And then we just watch it like TV. And we watch
[29:13.460 --> 29:15.020]  and we root for them until they get killed.
[29:15.240 --> 29:16.860]  And then it takes over the next person's view.
[29:17.160 --> 29:19.520]  And then you just see like... How are you always the winner?
[29:19.860 --> 29:21.280]  Yeah, well, no, it's like
[29:21.280 --> 29:23.420]  did the person that killed me win the game? Or how
[29:23.420 --> 29:25.340]  far did they get? And you just kind of string it along.
[29:25.400 --> 29:26.980]  And it's wildly entertaining.
[29:27.500 --> 29:29.100]  Yeah, I mean, if we're streaming my perspective,
[29:29.560 --> 29:31.160]  you'll have a lot of footage of me
[29:31.160 --> 29:33.360]  looking into the gulag waiting to fight someone.
[29:35.600 --> 29:36.980]  Okay, what's next on the list, Andrew?
[29:37.480 --> 29:38.080]  Next one,
[29:39.020 --> 29:40.520]  person Samothy organized
[29:40.520 --> 29:42.440]  like a really great list with
[29:42.440 --> 29:43.980]  specific episode mentions.
[29:44.660 --> 29:46.660]  Gavin does the end cap challenge
[29:46.660 --> 29:48.520]  2022 episode 35.
[29:49.200 --> 29:50.480]  Is that anything you... Would you
[29:50.480 --> 29:52.560]  have any interest in doing that? I feel like we kind of covered
[29:52.560 --> 29:54.340]  this with the like... What are the rules?
[29:54.460 --> 29:55.980]  Do I have to eat for a week on those?
[29:56.320 --> 29:58.440]  I think you have to just do... Yeah,
[29:58.540 --> 30:00.620]  there also was in episode 41
[30:00.620 --> 30:02.420]  eat only off of one aisle
[30:02.420 --> 30:04.440]  of the store challenge. Now the nice
[30:05.140 --> 30:06.340]  thing about this one
[30:07.000 --> 30:07.900]  is that you're
[30:08.340 --> 30:10.320]  here, so I can go to the...
[30:10.320 --> 30:12.140]  We can all go to the grocery store with you and
[30:12.140 --> 30:14.440]  verify that you're actually shopping from an end cap.
[30:15.640 --> 30:16.000]  And...
[30:17.440 --> 30:18.460]  I would trust
[30:18.460 --> 30:19.940]  you to do it because I think you're
[30:20.380 --> 30:22.320]  a righteous man who would not cheat us.
[30:22.400 --> 30:24.420]  I trust you too, but I think it's good content to walk
[30:24.420 --> 30:26.040]  around and watch you try to shop from end caps.
[30:26.160 --> 30:28.380]  We can do that new HEB that just opened up. It's two stories
[30:28.380 --> 30:29.400]  that everybody's so excited about.
[30:29.400 --> 30:30.640]  Is that that downtown one?
[30:31.360 --> 30:32.640]  It's on Lake Austin Boulevard.
[30:32.840 --> 30:35.480]  There's an HEB that has a separate escalator next
[30:35.480 --> 30:37.420]  to the main one and you push
[30:37.420 --> 30:39.280]  your car into it and it rides up next to you.
[30:39.400 --> 30:40.080]  That's so fucking cool.
[30:41.360 --> 30:42.120]  That's some tech.
[30:42.720 --> 30:44.100]  We'll definitely get footage of that.
[30:44.740 --> 30:47.240]  I just feel like if Gavin's going to be doing a challenge
[30:47.240 --> 30:49.400]  like that, we could take advantage of the
[30:49.400 --> 30:50.680]  fact that he's not remote.
[30:51.620 --> 30:52.760]  In a way we couldn't with Andrew.
[30:53.200 --> 30:55.300]  My thing would be like, is that something you do
[30:55.300 --> 30:57.100]  want to pick up on or do you think it's something we've left
[30:57.100 --> 30:58.420]  in the dust and why go back to it?
[30:58.520 --> 31:01.140]  It's your choice. We don't have to do all
[31:01.140 --> 31:02.960]  these things, it's just we're now evaluating
[31:02.960 --> 31:03.980]  if we want to or not.
[31:04.880 --> 31:07.280]  I think we've covered some of it with the draft.
[31:07.400 --> 31:09.180]  The food draft I think touches on some of
[31:09.180 --> 31:11.320]  these ideas. The risk with that is that
[31:11.320 --> 31:13.220]  it's just super easy to shop
[31:13.220 --> 31:13.780]  from end caps.
[31:14.720 --> 31:17.160]  We could try it and film it and if it's
[31:17.160 --> 31:18.620]  shit we just won't put it out.
[31:19.220 --> 31:21.140]  Or even like the thing you film could be
[31:21.140 --> 31:22.760]  this is shit, we're not, this is why,
[31:22.940 --> 31:24.440]  this is actually what this becomes.
[31:24.440 --> 31:25.620]  I'm happy to try it.
[31:26.900 --> 31:28.140]  I think it's worth
[31:28.620 --> 31:30.400]  giving a shot to and if it's
[31:30.400 --> 31:32.160]  not interesting for us,
[31:32.520 --> 31:34.460]  we just walk away. That's the thing I'm most concerned
[31:34.460 --> 31:34.580]  about.
[31:35.820 --> 31:38.400]  I don't want to be going down and checking
[31:38.400 --> 31:40.500]  off stuff on a list and fulfilling old obligations
[31:40.500 --> 31:42.460]  that we don't want to do because it's not going to be
[31:42.460 --> 31:44.520]  funny or good. I think that's good. There were people
[31:44.520 --> 31:46.400]  that were posting like, yeah there's old stuff
[31:46.400 --> 31:48.480]  but I really like the new ideas they're coming up
[31:48.480 --> 31:50.360]  with why go back and revisit this stuff and I
[31:50.360 --> 31:52.360]  agree. So if there's stuff that we feel like even
[31:52.360 --> 31:54.380]  on the fence about, to me it's just like
[31:54.380 --> 31:55.660]  let's just call it done and move on.
[31:56.360 --> 31:58.420]  But that's how I feel. If you guys want to
[31:58.420 --> 32:00.040]  take a different route, that's fine. What's the next one?
[32:00.100 --> 32:02.500]  No, I think that's exactly right. I completely agree.
[32:02.580 --> 32:04.280]  I think the point of this is more like stuff that
[32:04.280 --> 32:06.500]  we've forgotten about that we are actually excited
[32:06.500 --> 32:08.240]  about doing and will now do because we've been
[32:08.240 --> 32:10.380]  reminded. As opposed to feeling like
[32:10.380 --> 32:12.440]  we have to obligate things that we said at one
[32:12.440 --> 32:14.340]  point. Well I will say that I'm least excited about
[32:14.340 --> 32:16.200]  that one. Okay, well that's important.
[32:17.200 --> 32:18.280]  Like that's 100% important.
[32:18.440 --> 32:20.440]  Like for instance, here's my notes for current
[32:20.440 --> 32:21.900]  for the current episode of F***face.
[32:22.000 --> 32:24.820]  Of new stuff. We have plenty of new stuff.
[32:25.060 --> 32:26.720]  Like that's gotta be what? 60 or 70
[32:26.720 --> 32:28.380]  different things I want to talk about.
[32:28.520 --> 32:30.360]  So we shouldn't go overboard with the
[32:30.360 --> 32:32.500]  past. Nope. No, it's just more
[32:32.500 --> 32:34.460]  like putting a pin on these things.
[32:34.760 --> 32:36.420]  Like either being like, yeah I'm excited, let's
[32:36.420 --> 32:38.420]  actually do this or actually no
[32:38.420 --> 32:40.380]  we're not, like don't expect that going forward.
[32:40.480 --> 32:42.260]  You know what we should do? We should take
[32:42.260 --> 32:43.500]  one of these ideas
[32:44.180 --> 32:46.340]  that Andrew presents to us and we should
[32:46.340 --> 32:48.340]  agree to do it, but not till like
[32:48.340 --> 32:50.380]  2025. And we'll put it on the
[32:50.380 --> 32:52.420]  calendar for like 2025.
[32:53.020 --> 32:53.280]  Alright.
[32:54.100 --> 32:56.420]  And we'll have to do it in 2025. We'll be so far
[32:56.420 --> 32:58.080]  away from it, we won't even remember it, but it'll be on the calendar
[32:58.080 --> 33:00.100]  so we'll have to do it. It'll take us 9 months to watch a monkey movie.
[33:00.180 --> 33:01.700]  Yeah, we have to do it in 2025. Yeah.
[33:02.080 --> 33:04.360]  I love it. Okay. What's the next one
[33:04.360 --> 33:06.380]  Andrew? It would be cool to get an update
[33:06.380 --> 33:07.760]  on the Don Pedro project.
[33:08.260 --> 33:10.420]  Oh! That's my fault.
[33:10.800 --> 33:12.480]  Yeah, so all work
[33:12.480 --> 33:14.180]  on the Don Pedro project
[33:14.180 --> 33:15.960]  has ground to a halt. Oh no!
[33:17.040 --> 33:18.300]  Because I gave
[33:18.300 --> 33:19.820]  I got burned out on
[33:19.820 --> 33:21.540]  scanning, photographing and
[33:22.480 --> 33:23.920]  importing cards and I still had about
[33:24.480 --> 33:26.060]  I think I still have like 1100
[33:26.900 --> 33:27.220]  individual
[33:28.000 --> 33:28.880]  cards to go.
[33:29.860 --> 33:31.980]  And I hired Millie to do it and she's
[33:31.980 --> 33:34.080]  been very busy with this. So I should circle
[33:34.080 --> 33:35.980]  back around. Not only do I need to, like if
[33:35.980 --> 33:37.800]  she's not gonna do it, that's fine, I'll take it back over, but
[33:37.800 --> 33:39.960]  I gave her all the cards like over a year ago, so I need
[33:39.960 --> 33:41.400]  to see if she's still, I need to get them back from her.
[33:41.920 --> 33:43.860]  But it's not dead, it's just I just
[33:43.860 --> 33:45.900]  have had a million other things that I
[33:45.900 --> 33:47.920]  was more concerned with. But I would like
[33:47.920 --> 33:49.300]  to finish it at some point, for sure.
[33:49.500 --> 33:51.560]  I saw it in progress and it was
[33:51.560 --> 33:53.620]  super cool. It's still in process, yeah.
[33:53.820 --> 33:55.880]  I gotta get back to it. Thank you for
[33:55.880 --> 33:57.520]  reminding me, audience members.
[33:58.320 --> 33:59.960]  Do you have plans to do anything with the Smashing
[33:59.960 --> 34:01.960]  Sportsman, such as get the iconic comic
[34:01.960 --> 34:03.880]  book for the museum? I mainly brought
[34:03.880 --> 34:05.740]  this up, and I don't know if we should be talking
[34:05.740 --> 34:07.780]  about this yet, but I think our floor
[34:07.780 --> 34:09.900]  display on RTX will essentially be
[34:09.900 --> 34:11.880]  the museum? Yes. And just that could
[34:11.880 --> 34:13.680]  be an interesting part to add to it.
[34:13.920 --> 34:15.800]  I don't know if we have that already, but...
[34:15.800 --> 34:17.860]  I do not have it, but I will... you don't have
[34:17.860 --> 34:19.980]  one, right? Gav? I do have one.
[34:20.140 --> 34:21.840]  You do. Well, I'll try to
[34:21.840 --> 34:23.980]  track one down, and then if I can't
[34:23.980 --> 34:25.620]  maybe I can borrow it from you? Yeah.
[34:25.840 --> 34:27.860]  Mine is severely water damaged.
[34:28.260 --> 34:28.380]  Okay.
[34:29.960 --> 34:31.920]  That's kind of better. Yeah, that is kind of
[34:31.920 --> 34:33.060]  better. If you could just
[34:33.600 --> 34:35.880]  send me the number, the name and number of the
[34:35.880 --> 34:37.280]  comic, I'll find it.
[34:38.700 --> 34:39.700]  Absolutely. It's
[34:39.700 --> 34:41.340]  severely water damaged.
[34:42.600 --> 34:43.660]  Now, here's my
[34:43.660 --> 34:45.800]  question. Did it come to you severely water
[34:45.800 --> 34:47.440]  damaged? No, it did not.
[34:47.520 --> 34:49.360]  It did not come to me severely water damaged.
[34:49.380 --> 34:51.240]  Did it get severely water damaged in your bathtub?
[34:52.740 --> 34:53.740]  I don't remember.
[34:54.420 --> 34:55.400]  It was definitely
[34:55.400 --> 34:57.720]  in the bathroom when it happened, but I don't
[34:57.720 --> 34:59.540]  remember the specific...
[34:59.540 --> 35:01.460]  It was either that or the toilet, and you used your elbows
[35:01.460 --> 35:03.600]  to get it. There's two ways it got wet. Yeah, I goat
[35:03.600 --> 35:05.520]  kicked something out of my toilet
[35:05.520 --> 35:07.500]  and the water just happened to shoot
[35:07.500 --> 35:09.100]  all over. Oh, man.
[35:09.580 --> 35:11.680]  Andrew, between toilet seats and chairs,
[35:11.880 --> 35:12.880]  how many have you destroyed?
[35:14.720 --> 35:15.440]  Uh, one
[35:15.440 --> 35:16.360]  toilet seat.
[35:18.000 --> 35:18.720]  Two chairs?
[35:19.240 --> 35:21.580]  That's not bad. From when we started, but one was
[35:21.580 --> 35:22.740]  broken when we started.
[35:23.420 --> 35:25.400]  I've destroyed one toilet seat.
[35:25.440 --> 35:27.560]  Cracked it? Yeah. Ah, yeah, I did.
[35:27.620 --> 35:29.580]  I ripped the toilet seat right off my toilet when I first moved
[35:29.580 --> 35:31.620]  into the house on accident. No, I sat on it
[35:31.620 --> 35:33.500]  and it broke, and I didn't realize it broke,
[35:33.580 --> 35:35.620]  so I kept sitting on it, and then I went to stand up, and it just
[35:35.620 --> 35:38.100]  pinched me so bad. It hurt so fucking hard.
[35:38.300 --> 35:39.620]  Like, getting chills thinking about
[35:39.620 --> 35:41.440]  how bad it hurt. It was like right
[35:41.440 --> 35:43.720]  where your thigh meets your ass,
[35:44.040 --> 35:45.580]  it like pinched me so
[35:45.580 --> 35:47.720]  hard, I almost cried. And I was like in my
[35:47.720 --> 35:49.720]  twenties. Right where your thigh meets your ass,
[35:49.720 --> 35:51.300]  that line is supposedly
[35:51.300 --> 35:53.580]  the most painful place on your body
[35:53.580 --> 35:55.540]  to get tattooed. It's exactly where I got pinched.
[35:55.880 --> 35:57.680]  Is it because it's kind of where a fold happens?
[35:57.760 --> 35:59.540]  I guess so. It's just like incredibly sensitive
[35:59.540 --> 36:01.900]  skin. Oh, I'm like
[36:01.900 --> 36:03.560]  getting like chills thinking about
[36:03.560 --> 36:05.680]  how much it hurt. Oh, it's so
[36:05.680 --> 36:07.840]  bad. Did I...
[36:08.240 --> 36:09.580]  Did I ever... this isn't
[36:09.580 --> 36:11.620]  content for right now, but did I ever tell you
[36:11.620 --> 36:13.620]  guys... no, because if the answer is yes,
[36:13.680 --> 36:15.460]  then we'll move on. If the answer is no, then I'll say no for
[36:15.460 --> 36:17.660]  F*** Face. Did I ever tell you guys
[36:17.660 --> 36:19.600]  about the time... on F*** Face,
[36:19.620 --> 36:21.520]  I'm sure I've told Gavin in person, but
[36:21.520 --> 36:23.520]  on F*** Face, have I ever told the story about how
[36:23.520 --> 36:25.520]  I fell through the toilet, through the floor
[36:25.520 --> 36:27.460]  in the army? No. No.
[36:28.000 --> 36:29.240]  No, you haven't. Okay.
[36:29.900 --> 36:31.680]  Put that on your list. Put it on the list.
[36:31.680 --> 36:33.560]  Put it on the top of the list. Sitting on a toilet
[36:33.560 --> 36:34.760]  and fell through the ground.
[36:35.860 --> 36:37.940]  Oh my god. Oh no.
[36:39.480 --> 36:39.800]  Army
[36:39.800 --> 36:40.620]  toilet story.
[36:42.820 --> 36:43.880]  Alright, I'll tell you that one.
[36:43.960 --> 36:45.660]  I know I've talked about it on like at least the RT podcast.
[36:45.700 --> 36:47.640]  Okay, so Smashing Sportsman
[36:47.640 --> 36:49.880]  I think is good for... and I think that's
[36:49.880 --> 36:51.680]  probably fine to announce that that's what we want to do
[36:51.680 --> 36:53.740]  at RTX also. I also think we can just
[36:53.740 --> 36:55.720]  go ahead and say, until
[36:55.720 --> 36:57.840]  we get a cease and desist, that he's our official...
[36:57.840 --> 36:59.560]  Yeah, sure. Yeah, why not?
[36:59.560 --> 37:00.020]  Yeah, why not?
[37:01.180 --> 37:02.700]  We are defending...
[37:02.700 --> 37:05.820]  We're defending... Because I'm going to take it one further
[37:05.820 --> 37:07.400]  and I think we should actually...
[37:07.400 --> 37:09.620]  I was talking about this with Emily. I think we should sell these
[37:09.620 --> 37:11.560]  products actually. I think we
[37:11.560 --> 37:13.400]  should... I think we should
[37:13.400 --> 37:15.700]  say that we are officially protected by the Smashing
[37:15.700 --> 37:17.400]  Sportsman and by Falcons. And by Falcons.
[37:17.560 --> 37:19.360]  And by Falcons. And we should make...
[37:19.360 --> 37:21.540]  You know those like yard signs? Those metal yard signs
[37:21.540 --> 37:23.660]  that say like protected by ADT security?
[37:23.940 --> 37:25.600]  Yeah. We should make them say protected
[37:25.600 --> 37:26.160]  by Falcons.
[37:26.160 --> 37:28.340]  As easy as you can sell it in front of people's yards.
[37:28.540 --> 37:29.560]  Alright, hang on.
[37:29.820 --> 37:32.200]  That's a good idea, right? I'm putting it into the
[37:32.200 --> 37:34.160]  marketing right now. The amount of people
[37:34.160 --> 37:36.100]  who are seriously
[37:36.100 --> 37:38.220]  against scrumping and also protected by
[37:38.220 --> 37:38.620]  Falcons.
[37:40.900 --> 37:42.280]  Like, can you just imagine you roll
[37:42.280 --> 37:44.240]  up and instead of it's like, oh there's somebody
[37:44.240 --> 37:46.040]  who's like vivant, protected by...
[37:46.040 --> 37:47.980]  No, it's protected by Falcons! Jesus Christ!
[37:49.440 --> 37:50.400]  Will it just be a picture
[37:50.400 --> 37:52.300]  of a falcon in a f*** face falcon cap?
[37:52.500 --> 37:52.660]  Yeah.
[37:54.760 --> 37:55.280]  It'd be like
[37:55.280 --> 37:56.620]  the most badass picture of a falcon
[37:56.620 --> 37:58.640]  ever. We'll get Tobin
[37:58.640 --> 37:59.600]  to draw it. It'll be amazing.
[38:00.700 --> 38:02.540]  Alright, hang on. Is it
[38:02.540 --> 38:04.580]  protected by Falcons? Protected by Falcons.
[38:04.860 --> 38:05.380]  I think.
[38:06.400 --> 38:06.560]  Okay.
[38:09.080 --> 38:10.720]  Sorry, I'm not trying to come up with show bits.
[38:10.720 --> 38:11.440]  No, no, this is fine.
[38:11.640 --> 38:13.340]  I've been sitting on that for a while.
[38:13.420 --> 38:16.520]  Wanna make a small metal yard sign that's like protected by
[38:16.520 --> 38:18.760]  ADT security that says protected by Falcons.
[38:18.940 --> 38:20.420]  With a picture of a really badass falcon.
[38:20.420 --> 38:22.960]  With a picture of a
[38:22.960 --> 38:24.300]  badass falcon.
[38:24.740 --> 38:25.220]  Thank you.
[38:26.680 --> 38:28.880]  Okay. Alright, Andrew, what's next?
[38:29.640 --> 38:30.600]  The next one
[38:30.600 --> 38:32.660]  is, this is a great one.
[38:33.120 --> 38:34.660]  Did Geoff become an arm
[38:34.660 --> 38:36.540]  out the window while driving guy
[38:36.540 --> 38:38.580]  or Gavin a cereal on the porch guy?
[38:38.700 --> 38:39.520]  2021 episode.
[38:41.620 --> 38:42.700]  I'll go first.
[38:43.220 --> 38:43.440]  Yeah.
[38:43.740 --> 38:46.400]  I tried to become an arm
[38:46.400 --> 38:47.600]  out the window guy. Yeah.
[38:48.400 --> 38:49.600]  And I had to
[38:49.600 --> 38:51.000]  stop. Because
[38:51.580 --> 38:53.480]  as much as I liked being an arm
[38:53.480 --> 38:55.640]  out the window guy and I appreciated the breeze
[38:55.640 --> 38:56.420]  and the freedom of it,
[38:57.400 --> 38:59.540]  I became, once I started rolling down my window
[38:59.540 --> 39:01.520]  and hanging my arm out, I became aware of other
[39:01.520 --> 39:03.540]  people doing it. And those people are annoying
[39:03.540 --> 39:05.560]  with their music and all that shit, which means
[39:05.560 --> 39:07.600]  that I'm being just as annoying to other people as they
[39:07.600 --> 39:08.500]  are to me, so I had to stop.
[39:09.080 --> 39:11.580]  Could we potentially design a different kind of
[39:11.580 --> 39:13.160]  window that just has a small hole
[39:13.160 --> 39:15.080]  with a nice seal around it?
[39:15.620 --> 39:16.900]  And that way the sound
[39:16.900 --> 39:18.920]  doesn't get cut, but your arm is out. I think that's a
[39:18.920 --> 39:20.160]  great idea. Yeah.
[39:20.600 --> 39:22.940]  Like a clear rubber or something you could
[39:22.940 --> 39:24.760]  slide your arm through. Yeah, like in movies,
[39:24.940 --> 39:26.680]  when you see they're doing an experiment
[39:26.680 --> 39:29.180]  and they put their hand through the gloves
[39:29.180 --> 39:29.680]  like that.
[39:31.100 --> 39:33.100]  If you just had like a lab
[39:33.100 --> 39:35.000]  glove. Yeah, a little lab
[39:35.000 --> 39:35.260]  glove.
[39:36.540 --> 39:39.180]  Oh, look at how normal
[39:39.180 --> 39:40.400]  this guy is driving.
[39:42.760 --> 39:43.400]  That way
[39:43.400 --> 39:44.840]  you get to have your arm out the window
[39:44.840 --> 39:46.760]  and you also are protected from UV
[39:46.760 --> 39:48.400]  damage. And you don't
[39:49.440 --> 39:50.940]  pollute your music and everybody
[39:50.940 --> 39:52.960]  else. How about you, Gavin? Are you eating
[39:52.960 --> 39:54.860]  cereal on the porch? And when you're on the highway,
[39:55.000 --> 39:56.840]  the glove is like...
[40:06.400 --> 40:08.820]  I didn't become a porch guy eating
[40:08.820 --> 40:10.940]  cereal. Number one, I've never bought any seating
[40:10.940 --> 40:12.420]  to go out there. Ah, okay.
[40:12.720 --> 40:14.220]  And number two, there was a bug.
[40:14.540 --> 40:16.820]  A giant beetle
[40:17.800 --> 40:18.840]  that was like right
[40:18.840 --> 40:19.880]  below my doorbell.
[40:20.760 --> 40:22.800]  The bug was on its back and there
[40:22.800 --> 40:24.600]  was like a white grub
[40:25.140 --> 40:27.020]  crawling and trying to get out of the bug's
[40:27.020 --> 40:28.720]  anus. And it was really off-putting.
[40:28.820 --> 40:30.800]  Oh my God. No, we don't
[40:30.800 --> 40:32.700]  need to put that in. I thought it was fascinating.
[40:33.180 --> 40:34.700]  Either way, it wasn't the
[40:34.700 --> 40:35.780]  environment for cereal.
[40:38.960 --> 40:39.360]  Oh
[40:41.080 --> 40:42.760]  man. That's a day of shame,
[40:42.880 --> 40:44.820]  Gavin, because I feel like an all-time boring
[40:44.820 --> 40:46.900]  guy move is sitting on his front
[40:46.900 --> 40:48.300]  step eating cereal.
[40:48.500 --> 40:49.420]  It's a pretty boring way to live.
[40:50.940 --> 40:52.960]  I could make it happen. I might try it.
[40:53.300 --> 40:54.820]  I might try it. When the
[40:54.820 --> 40:56.820]  coast is clear from nature.
[40:57.360 --> 40:58.720]  The next one comes from
[40:59.160 --> 41:00.700]  Miko14. Pretty obscure
[41:00.700 --> 41:02.760]  one, but a while back, Geoff mentioned being able to
[41:02.760 --> 41:04.620]  turn off his sense of smell with his
[41:04.620 --> 41:06.860]  in quotes, nose flaps. Yeah. And Gavin
[41:06.860 --> 41:08.780]  was gonna try to film it. I'm weirdly
[41:08.780 --> 41:10.860]  curious to see what the fuck he was talking about.
[41:10.960 --> 41:12.580]  I mean, you could do that right now, couldn't you?
[41:12.580 --> 41:14.920]  Yeah, this seemed like a perfect opportunity. No, I was gonna get
[41:14.920 --> 41:16.660]  an endoscope and shove it in his nose
[41:16.660 --> 41:18.760]  and film his flaps. Yeah, we need to get
[41:18.760 --> 41:20.760]  some sort of a macro lens or something.
[41:20.780 --> 41:22.800]  Yeah, I would need one of those little worm...
[41:22.800 --> 41:24.140]  Yeah, I'm down with that.
[41:25.700 --> 41:26.820]  Yeah, just close my nose flaps
[41:26.820 --> 41:28.500]  right now. We should also put some...
[41:28.500 --> 41:29.200]  Close the business.
[41:30.600 --> 41:33.060]  Is it a durian? What's the stinky fruit?
[41:33.240 --> 41:34.680]  We should see if like... Oh, a durian fruit?
[41:34.680 --> 41:36.720]  Yeah, we should rip one open under you
[41:36.720 --> 41:38.660]  and see if... Oh, yeah!
[41:38.820 --> 41:40.160]  Sir Strumming...
[41:40.160 --> 41:42.700]  I won't be there for the...
[41:42.700 --> 41:42.920]  Sir Strumming.
[41:44.240 --> 41:46.720]  We might have to test his flaps without going
[41:46.720 --> 41:48.820]  up there. We should get smelling salts
[41:48.820 --> 41:50.380]  too. And just see like a
[41:50.380 --> 41:52.640]  variety of escalatingly smelly things and then
[41:52.640 --> 41:54.740]  I can tell you if I smell it or not with my flaps closed.
[41:54.840 --> 41:56.700]  The confidence that he has
[41:56.700 --> 41:58.800]  in this where he's going to smelling salts is insane.
[41:58.940 --> 42:00.600]  Here's what we do. We go
[42:00.600 --> 42:02.640]  inside the port-a-potty and we
[42:02.640 --> 42:04.740]  open the can of fermented
[42:04.740 --> 42:06.440]  fish. Yeah. And
[42:06.440 --> 42:08.740]  we all start in there. Let's see who lasts
[42:08.740 --> 42:10.420]  the longest. We'll be straight out.
[42:10.740 --> 42:12.720]  Yeah! This is the can that you're supposed
[42:12.720 --> 42:14.680]  to open underwater because it's so repugnant.
[42:14.840 --> 42:16.640]  Yeah. And then we're going to see how long
[42:16.640 --> 42:18.680]  you can stand in the port-a-potty. We'll see how strong my
[42:18.680 --> 42:20.480]  flaps are. With the can of Sir Strumming.
[42:20.700 --> 42:22.420]  I feel pretty confident about my flaps.
[42:22.500 --> 42:24.580]  Have you smelled it before? I've been
[42:24.580 --> 42:26.640]  near it and it was
[42:26.640 --> 42:28.840]  horrendous. We opened one during
[42:28.840 --> 42:30.480]  a Mega64 podcast
[42:30.480 --> 42:32.360]  one time. In the room? Yes.
[42:32.560 --> 42:34.540]  And we had to... the room was
[42:34.540 --> 42:36.500]  ruined for... it was like the size
[42:36.500 --> 42:38.200]  of this space. Huge.
[42:38.800 --> 42:40.200]  And it was ruined for like a week.
[42:40.340 --> 42:42.580]  Here's what I'll say, Geoff. Yeah. Do you remember
[42:42.580 --> 42:44.420]  our tenure
[42:44.420 --> 42:46.520]  in Achievement Hunter together? When we
[42:46.520 --> 42:48.520]  worked in an office together every day. We played video games for
[42:48.520 --> 42:50.500]  about a decade. We did all that stuff. Do you remember
[42:50.500 --> 42:52.500]  how Liquid Ass made its way
[42:52.500 --> 42:54.720]  into our office a lot?
[42:54.880 --> 42:56.220]  Yep. And how I always
[42:56.220 --> 42:58.420]  sprayed it and I was really... I was
[42:58.420 --> 43:00.040]  definitely the instigator of Liquid Ass.
[43:00.620 --> 43:02.560]  It's because I could turn my flaps
[43:02.560 --> 43:04.180]  off or I could turn the smell off
[43:04.560 --> 43:06.220]  close my flaps and I don't smell Liquid Ass.
[43:06.280 --> 43:08.380]  So if I don't smell Liquid Ass, I'm sure I won't smell this other stuff.
[43:09.140 --> 43:10.120]  This is now
[43:10.880 --> 43:12.260]  the thing I'm most excited about.
[43:12.500 --> 43:12.600]  Okay.
[43:15.040 --> 43:16.400]  We'll have to do it soon. Do you
[43:16.400 --> 43:18.480]  want to buy the thing that goes up
[43:18.480 --> 43:20.260]  a fucking nose or whatever? You want me to buy it?
[43:20.380 --> 43:21.980]  I mean, I can get it. It's like
[43:21.980 --> 43:23.760]  a thing you can buy on Amazon, isn't it?
[43:23.840 --> 43:26.100]  It's not crazy. We'll have to do some research.
[43:26.100 --> 43:28.200]  But let's definitely put that on the list.
[43:28.780 --> 43:30.120]  Thank you for bringing that up, audience
[43:30.120 --> 43:32.120]  member. I'm very confident
[43:32.120 --> 43:34.140]  in my nose flaps. Where is the port-a-potty
[43:34.140 --> 43:35.860]  right now? It's in stage 2. In stage 2.
[43:36.620 --> 43:38.440]  So we have easy access to it.
[43:38.560 --> 43:40.220]  Oh, definitely. Phenomenal. Yep. Alright, what's the next
[43:40.220 --> 43:42.480]  one, Andrew? Next one comes from
[43:44.800 --> 43:45.160]  AJC555964.
[43:45.640 --> 43:46.120]  In a really
[43:46.120 --> 43:47.960]  early episode, Andrew lost a bet and
[43:47.960 --> 43:50.060]  owed Gavin $50 and he put it in a
[43:50.060 --> 43:52.080]  small safe inside a bigger safe inside a
[43:52.080 --> 43:54.100]  bigger safe with like 50 keys
[43:54.100 --> 43:56.160]  in it, but he never sent the safe to Gavin.
[43:56.480 --> 43:58.140]  Did he ever get his $50 out of all
[43:58.140 --> 44:00.160]  the safes? I did not get
[44:00.160 --> 44:02.100]  the $50 out and I still have
[44:02.100 --> 44:03.760]  the safe. It's like 20 pounds.
[44:04.040 --> 44:06.260]  I don't know what I'm gonna do with this. It's such
[44:06.260 --> 44:08.140]  an annoyance. I meant to pull
[44:08.140 --> 44:09.920]  it out. I know where it is.
[44:10.520 --> 44:12.040]  I'll need to take a photo of it and just
[44:12.040 --> 44:14.160]  send an update. I still have the safe. I'm still trying
[44:14.160 --> 44:16.040]  to figure out... I don't remember the combination
[44:16.040 --> 44:17.740]  to open it at this point is the problem.
[44:17.880 --> 44:19.640]  I wish it was economical to
[44:20.300 --> 44:22.300]  travel with because we could put it in the museum
[44:22.300 --> 44:23.920]  and let people try. Everybody get one turn.
[44:24.240 --> 44:25.320]  That would be great.
[44:25.940 --> 44:28.460]  You get one crack
[44:28.460 --> 44:29.040]  at the safe.
[44:29.660 --> 44:30.820]  Oh my god.
[44:30.980 --> 44:34.300]  You get the $50. Maybe we could
[44:34.300 --> 44:36.360]  recreate it. That's a great idea. Can we recreate
[44:36.360 --> 44:37.440]  that for RTX?
[44:38.080 --> 44:39.580]  Yeah, I don't see why not.
[44:40.580 --> 44:41.820]  It wouldn't be hard to do.
[44:41.840 --> 44:43.780]  I'll donate $50 to the cause.
[44:44.080 --> 44:44.520]  Wow!
[44:47.660 --> 44:48.280]  Thank you.
[44:51.320 --> 44:51.680]  Okay.
[44:51.740 --> 44:52.240]  We'll try to
[44:52.240 --> 44:54.520]  recreate it or at least figure out how to get it out of Andrew's
[44:54.520 --> 44:56.260]  house. I have two more.
[44:56.460 --> 44:58.360]  Next one comes from Terrarian182.
[44:58.760 --> 45:00.160]  A nose size comparison.
[45:00.340 --> 45:01.900]  At one point, I think we talked about
[45:01.900 --> 45:04.060]  molding our noses and comparing the molds
[45:04.060 --> 45:05.860]  or our face doing a face mold,
[45:06.160 --> 45:08.080]  a head mold. I just thought that was funny.
[45:08.380 --> 45:10.420]  I forgot that we talked about that. What was the purpose
[45:10.420 --> 45:11.460]  of doing that? I don't remember that at all.
[45:11.680 --> 45:14.120]  I think it started as part of
[45:14.120 --> 45:16.080]  the unbreakable nose thing maybe
[45:16.080 --> 45:18.240]  and then Gavin, you having a big nose
[45:18.240 --> 45:20.080]  and comparing noses and then it turned
[45:20.080 --> 45:22.220]  into who has the bigger head, I think
[45:22.220 --> 45:23.460]  and it turned into a full head mold.
[45:23.480 --> 45:26.040]  I think we were going to dip our heads in water
[45:26.040 --> 45:27.580]  and see who displaced the most water.
[45:28.940 --> 45:30.020]  Or were we going to go full mold?
[45:30.500 --> 45:33.140]  I just remember the mold part.
[45:33.420 --> 45:35.660]  That one kind of seems a bit aimless.
[45:35.840 --> 45:37.800]  I feel like we need to remember
[45:37.800 --> 45:39.620]  why we were doing it. We need a connection to it.
[45:39.860 --> 45:42.140]  I agree. I think it was a big head thing.
[45:42.160 --> 45:42.900]  I just thought it was funny.
[45:42.900 --> 45:44.960]  Just as an idea to float around.
[45:45.420 --> 45:47.460]  If we made molds of our heads
[45:47.460 --> 45:49.000]  like yours and mine, are we going to hit
[45:49.000 --> 45:50.680]  the noses with bats and see who wins?
[45:50.860 --> 45:51.340]  What?
[45:52.920 --> 45:54.320]  Because he's got an unbreakable nose.
[45:54.600 --> 45:56.940]  Why would his mold also have an unbreakable nose?
[45:57.480 --> 45:59.020]  If you start with perfection...
[46:01.060 --> 46:02.840]  I do think that my nose
[46:02.840 --> 46:04.140]  would hold up better than yours.
[46:04.840 --> 46:06.800]  It would be more aerodynamic.
[46:07.580 --> 46:08.860]  That could be an angle on
[46:08.860 --> 46:10.200]  why we're doing it.
[46:10.960 --> 46:12.320]  That's fair. I'm also fine with
[46:12.320 --> 46:13.740]  letting this go. I just thought it was funny.
[46:14.020 --> 46:14.380]  Really?
[46:15.860 --> 46:17.320]  What is that? The big red boots?
[46:18.400 --> 46:20.220]  He just bought those big red shoes.
[46:20.420 --> 46:20.940]  What is that?
[46:21.440 --> 46:23.120]  They're all over the place now.
[46:24.080 --> 46:25.940]  They're like Astro Boy boots.
[46:26.500 --> 46:27.100]  They're everywhere.
[46:27.560 --> 46:29.160]  There's a lot of funny videos on TikTok of people
[46:29.160 --> 46:30.980]  that put them on and can't get them off.
[46:32.000 --> 46:33.140]  Is that why you bought them?
[46:33.420 --> 46:34.660]  I just thought they'd be funny to have.
[46:35.780 --> 46:36.500]  Fair enough.
[46:36.500 --> 46:38.520]  I have that Mischief app
[46:38.520 --> 46:40.540]  and it notifies you when a drop happens.
[46:40.680 --> 46:42.480]  It just notified me right now.
[46:42.660 --> 46:44.260]  I actually don't know if I got them.
[46:44.320 --> 46:45.640]  I entered a lottery to get them.
[46:46.500 --> 46:48.360]  If I get them, they'll charge my car.
[46:48.420 --> 46:49.140]  There you go.
[46:49.240 --> 46:52.360]  If we can figure out what to do with the molds
[46:52.360 --> 46:53.840]  I think maybe we got a thing.
[46:54.000 --> 46:55.880]  I'm imagining a physical 100
[46:55.880 --> 46:57.840]  where they smash their busts.
[46:57.980 --> 46:58.680]  That'd be great.
[46:59.580 --> 47:01.380]  Maybe I'll have to smash my nose
[47:01.380 --> 47:03.400]  if my flaps don't work.
[47:05.040 --> 47:07.320]  Maybe whoever can't throw a fruit
[47:07.320 --> 47:08.660]  the furthest
[47:08.660 --> 47:10.120]  has to smash their own nose.
[47:13.020 --> 47:13.960]  Last one I have
[47:13.960 --> 47:14.460]  comes from
[47:14.460 --> 47:16.760]  Pipe underscore Enigma underscore Pipe
[47:17.280 --> 47:18.400]  Chef Fruit Gloves
[47:19.020 --> 47:20.280]  Just something that was mentioned.
[47:20.400 --> 47:22.160]  I don't think we've ever followed up on the Fruit Gloves.
[47:22.320 --> 47:22.840]  You're right.
[47:23.080 --> 47:25.760]  I followed up once and told you guys I was still working on it
[47:25.760 --> 47:27.280]  and then I completely... I'll be honest
[47:27.280 --> 47:29.740]  I forgot about it and moved on.
[47:29.860 --> 47:31.640]  I have all the ingredients of the Fruit Gloves
[47:31.640 --> 47:33.040]  in a basket under my computer.
[47:33.280 --> 47:35.260]  I just need to put them together. I'll get back on that.
[47:35.320 --> 47:36.980]  I apologize audience. I'll get back on the Fruit Gloves.
[47:37.280 --> 47:39.480]  What happened was... see what happened was
[47:40.580 --> 47:41.540]  I had that idea
[47:41.540 --> 47:43.040]  right around the time that I was
[47:43.640 --> 47:45.240]  coming out of a uniform
[47:47.140 --> 47:49.060]  when I was coming out of a phase
[47:49.060 --> 47:49.780]  a uniform phase
[47:49.780 --> 47:51.720]  and so
[47:51.720 --> 47:53.400]  I just kind of shelved the idea
[47:53.400 --> 47:54.540]  because we were doing other stuff.
[47:55.260 --> 47:56.520]  But I'll get back to it.
[47:57.240 --> 47:59.560]  That's good. And that's our list of stuff.
[47:59.560 --> 48:01.640]  That's our list. Thank you so much
[48:01.640 --> 48:02.740]  to everyone who submitted things.
[48:04.220 --> 48:05.720]  What's next on our list of things
[48:05.720 --> 48:07.740]  to get through in Sausage Talk?
[48:08.180 --> 48:09.280]  Do you want Best Of?
[48:09.860 --> 48:10.940]  Let's end with Best Of.
[48:11.260 --> 48:12.760]  So I open this dumb thing up.
[48:13.420 --> 48:15.840]  Not dumb at all. It's not dumb at all. I didn't mean to say it like that.
[48:16.200 --> 48:17.820]  I got a care package
[48:17.820 --> 48:19.740]  I got a care package from the Cosmic
[48:19.740 --> 48:21.620]  from the Cosmic Crisp people
[48:22.180 --> 48:23.840]  It was very sweet of them
[48:23.840 --> 48:25.720]  It comes all the way to us from Brewster, Washington
[48:25.720 --> 48:27.300]  and I'm going to open it up here
[48:27.300 --> 48:29.660]  and what do I have in here? A Cosmic Crisp
[48:29.660 --> 48:31.680]  water bottle. That's beautiful.
[48:31.920 --> 48:33.440]  No, I didn't get that. That's a different item.
[48:33.520 --> 48:35.380]  It's got a wooden cap.
[48:35.680 --> 48:37.100]  That's nice. Is that like
[48:37.100 --> 48:38.240]  wood or cork?
[48:39.820 --> 48:41.100]  It feels like wood though.
[48:41.760 --> 48:43.860]  Got a Cosmic Crisp
[48:44.280 --> 48:44.640]  beanie.
[48:45.220 --> 48:47.220]  Oh, slap it on. Gav, you want the beanie?
[48:47.440 --> 48:49.520]  No, I'll take a picture of you in it. I'm not going to wear it, but thanks.
[48:49.540 --> 48:50.720]  Beanies hurt my hair.
[48:51.640 --> 48:52.040]  I understand.
[48:53.960 --> 48:55.680]  Two Cosmic Crisp hats in brown
[48:55.680 --> 48:57.040]  and blue. Anybody wants these?
[48:57.400 --> 48:58.220]  I'll take a blue.
[48:59.120 --> 48:59.900]  That's for you, man.
[49:01.280 --> 49:02.340]  There you go.
[49:03.680 --> 49:05.320]  It's not over. They sent us more.
[49:05.520 --> 49:06.920]  Is it apples? By us, I mean me.
[49:08.760 --> 49:09.440]  Let's see.
[49:09.560 --> 49:11.680]  Alright, that's it. We got a Cosmic Crisp
[49:11.680 --> 49:13.640]  Eat, Play, Cook, Inspire, Imagine the
[49:13.640 --> 49:15.360]  Possibilities astronaut patch.
[49:16.120 --> 49:17.720]  If you want to eat apples in space.
[49:17.780 --> 49:18.960]  Where are you going to put that?
[49:19.300 --> 49:20.900]  Probably on my jacket or something.
[49:21.120 --> 49:22.760]  Or your jersey?
[49:22.760 --> 49:23.820]  Or my jersey.
[49:24.920 --> 49:26.800]  We got three
[49:26.800 --> 49:28.800]  Cosmic Crisp apple lapel
[49:28.800 --> 49:29.180]  pins.
[49:29.520 --> 49:33.220]  Like all the Republican senators have a fucking AK-47
[49:33.220 --> 49:34.860]  now or whatever on their lapels.
[49:35.280 --> 49:36.420]  Everybody else has American flags.
[49:36.680 --> 49:38.480]  A bunch of Republicans have fucking guns.
[49:38.760 --> 49:39.680]  I'm going to have an apple.
[49:41.020 --> 49:42.920]  Oh, another patch.
[49:43.600 --> 49:44.760]  Oh, here's a Cosmic Crisp
[49:45.520 --> 49:47.080]  Amazing Flavor, Infinite Possibilities.
[49:47.140 --> 49:49.160]  This is a note from the Cosmic Crisp team.
[49:49.480 --> 49:51.020]  Geoff, first off, thank you so much
[49:51.020 --> 49:53.000]  for your support of Cosmic Crisp. We appreciate all
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.180]  the love and honesty you, Andrew, and Gavin share on the pod.
[49:55.520 --> 49:56.900]  Your fans are truly dedicated
[49:56.900 --> 49:58.240]  and we can see why.
[49:58.860 --> 50:01.280]  Dude, they know all about you. They just don't like you.
[50:01.420 --> 50:02.560]  That is so cool.
[50:04.020 --> 50:05.360]  Thank you so much
[50:05.360 --> 50:07.060]  Cosmic Crisp team. We really appreciate
[50:07.060 --> 50:08.880]  that. And then the last thing
[50:08.880 --> 50:10.820]  and by the way, we appreciate your product.
[50:11.340 --> 50:13.080]  I have a bunch of Cosmic Crisps at my house right now.
[50:13.120 --> 50:14.380]  It's now the only apple that I buy.
[50:14.760 --> 50:16.760]  And they sent me what appears to be two knives.
[50:17.140 --> 50:17.820]  Apple knives?
[50:18.560 --> 50:19.780]  You got knives?
[50:20.040 --> 50:21.420]  Oh yeah, he got knives.
[50:21.760 --> 50:23.540]  Andrew, it sounds like Geoff got the way better package.
[50:23.700 --> 50:24.080]  Wow!
[50:25.880 --> 50:26.680]  Holy shit!
[50:27.660 --> 50:29.800]  I have to be careful.
[50:31.760 --> 50:32.940]  Yeah, I got the same one.
[50:33.140 --> 50:35.020]  You can fight like this.
[50:36.140 --> 50:37.340]  I'm like a little baby Darth Maul.
[50:37.580 --> 50:37.600]  Yeah.
[50:40.760 --> 50:41.920]  This is crazy.
[50:42.800 --> 50:44.080]  Wow, that is super, super cool.
[50:44.200 --> 50:45.420]  Thank you so much, Cosmic Crisp.
[50:45.420 --> 50:46.400]  You can have that if you want.
[50:49.040 --> 50:50.420]  Yeah, I'll get you.
[50:50.580 --> 50:52.560]  Fuck yeah, dude. That's awesome.
[50:52.960 --> 50:53.680]  Gavin, do you want the knife?
[50:55.680 --> 50:57.060]  You weren't mentioned in the note.
[50:57.140 --> 50:57.720]  They know who you are.
[50:57.860 --> 51:01.180]  I don't think he was mentioned in mine.
[51:01.260 --> 51:01.720]  You exist.
[51:04.040 --> 51:04.760]  Very cool.
[51:05.440 --> 51:06.680]  And Gavin,
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.220]  we have the best of, right?
[51:08.800 --> 51:11.100]  I condensed all of F*** Face so far
[51:12.400 --> 51:13.480]  into just under
[51:13.480 --> 51:14.120]  three minutes.
[51:16.000 --> 51:17.820]  Let's do it. This is the best of F*** Face.
[51:18.100 --> 51:19.720]  Best of F*** Face. Everything up to this point.
[51:20.160 --> 51:21.600]  When you say up to this point,
[51:21.880 --> 51:23.180]  is that through all recordings
[51:23.180 --> 51:24.240]  or through releases?
[51:25.080 --> 51:26.560]  Through everything that's released.
[51:26.980 --> 51:28.620]  Shall I play?
[51:29.720 --> 51:30.120]  Well, yeah.
[51:30.880 --> 51:31.920]  Is everyone ready?
[51:33.160 --> 51:34.560]  What do you think we're doing?
[51:34.620 --> 51:35.880]  We've been waiting for like ten minutes.
[51:36.280 --> 51:36.600]  What do you mean?
[51:38.940 --> 51:40.680]  Are we in the room listening?
[51:40.680 --> 51:43.140]  What are we doing?
[51:44.180 --> 51:45.660]  Yeah, we can hear it through headphones.
[51:45.700 --> 51:46.860]  Yeah, heard that.
[51:47.560 --> 51:48.600]  Playing the whole thing. Ready?
[51:51.660 --> 51:52.380]  Free birds.
[51:52.800 --> 51:53.640]  Oh, wait. Wrong one.
[51:56.520 --> 51:57.240]  Biology homework.
[51:58.260 --> 51:58.980]  SUV fart.
[52:00.060 --> 52:01.120]  Taco Bell drive-thru.
[52:02.840 --> 52:04.640]  I'm gonna win, so I'm not gonna eat the pencil.
[52:04.640 --> 52:07.040]  We agreed that you're gonna eat the pencil dressed as piss boy, right?
[52:08.680 --> 52:09.380]  Oh, shit!
[52:09.380 --> 52:11.020]  Okay, okay.
[52:11.160 --> 52:12.780]  Oh, shit!
[52:13.060 --> 52:15.260]  Just got the shipment of baseball bats.
[52:15.300 --> 52:16.620]  Oh, my God. The dog just farted.
[52:17.720 --> 52:18.920]  Shut up!
[52:28.420 --> 52:30.980]  My real name is Raymond Somer.
[52:31.880 --> 52:32.480]  Smooth.
[52:34.020 --> 52:35.880]  That's why I had another root canal!
[52:40.600 --> 52:43.580]  I fucked up.
[52:43.580 --> 52:44.620]  I fucked up so bad.
[52:59.960 --> 53:03.620]  The definition of condiment.
[53:05.420 --> 53:05.940]  Yes!
[53:06.460 --> 53:09.360]  I like that this guy is complaining.
[53:28.880 --> 53:31.260]  God damn it!
[53:31.380 --> 53:32.880]  Are you serious?
[53:32.880 --> 53:33.500]  God damn it!
[53:34.080 --> 53:34.340]  No!
[53:35.260 --> 53:37.860]  I bought a port-a-potty a year ago.
[53:38.620 --> 53:39.500]  Got it all scheduled.
[53:40.040 --> 53:40.800]  Crap.
[53:46.320 --> 53:47.840]  So, Gaff...
[53:47.840 --> 53:50.060]  You look like dog shit!
[53:52.760 --> 53:54.460]  Oh, my God.
[53:55.480 --> 53:58.100]  Oh, no.
[53:58.100 --> 53:58.640]  Uh...
[53:58.640 --> 54:02.400]  We got salad cream frozen bomb pops.
[54:02.500 --> 54:03.360]  No!
[54:07.020 --> 54:08.940]  What was that?
[54:12.660 --> 54:15.760]  My name is... What the fuck was that?
[54:17.600 --> 54:18.480]  Stop!
[54:19.100 --> 54:19.980]  No!
[54:21.820 --> 54:22.260]  Yeah!
[54:23.680 --> 54:24.120]  Oh, wait.
[54:24.120 --> 54:25.540]  Stop! No, Geoff!
[54:29.200 --> 54:32.780]  This might be the final part of my Best of F*** Face compilation.
[54:33.240 --> 54:34.700]  Oh, my fucking God!
[54:48.780 --> 54:51.100]  And that is the Best of F*** Face compilation.
[54:51.100 --> 54:52.020]  Oh, my God!
[54:52.460 --> 54:54.160]  Can you airdrop that to me?
[54:55.380 --> 54:55.940]  Wow!
[54:57.200 --> 54:58.940]  That was unreal.
[54:59.500 --> 55:00.860]  Gavin, that was amazing.
[55:02.220 --> 55:04.080]  What was your goal there?
[55:04.460 --> 55:06.940]  Just to get every fart, burp, and gross noise?
[55:07.200 --> 55:09.220]  Pretty much just anything that wasn't words.
[55:10.440 --> 55:11.560]  That's great.
[55:11.960 --> 55:14.560]  With a few classics like, you know, the Raymond Soman.
[55:14.840 --> 55:16.480]  Throwing in the pencil.
[55:17.040 --> 55:17.840]  Yeah, just milestones.
[55:17.840 --> 55:19.060]  Geoff yelling.
[55:19.400 --> 55:21.320]  Geoff, when do we release that? What are we doing with it?
[55:21.680 --> 55:22.500]  Just pop it on YouTube?
[55:22.760 --> 55:24.040]  Yeah, I think you can put it on YouTube, whatever.
[55:24.720 --> 55:27.400]  Maybe after Sascha's talk comes out, just flop it on there.
[55:27.460 --> 55:28.000]  That's a great idea.
[55:29.340 --> 55:30.020]  Incredible work.
[55:30.340 --> 55:32.160]  And that way, when somebody's like,
[55:32.300 --> 55:34.640]  Should I listen to F*** Face? I don't know what it is.
[55:35.800 --> 55:39.860]  Check out this introductory piece of content.
[55:39.960 --> 55:42.400]  If you make it through that, you know, best of luck.
[55:42.720 --> 55:42.960]  Yep.
[55:44.840 --> 55:45.680]  Boy, wow.
[55:45.680 --> 55:46.840]  That was...
[55:47.440 --> 55:48.020]  F***ing great.
[55:48.340 --> 55:49.840]  I mean, I'm really impressed with you, man.
[55:49.900 --> 55:51.260]  That was a phenomenal ending.
[55:51.980 --> 55:54.420]  It took more than three minutes to make.
[55:54.580 --> 55:55.940]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[55:56.740 --> 55:58.420]  Now, can I ask, was it linear?
[55:59.080 --> 55:59.840]  That was all in order.
[55:59.980 --> 56:00.320]  Wow.
[56:01.180 --> 56:04.560]  That's why it was mainly farts at the beginning.
[56:05.100 --> 56:05.280]  Yeah, yeah.
[56:06.740 --> 56:10.520]  Yeah, we progressed through farts,
[56:11.220 --> 56:12.260]  into gags,
[56:12.500 --> 56:13.300]  into burps,
[56:13.300 --> 56:15.100]  back to gags, into a bit of vomit.
[56:16.440 --> 56:17.160]  I'm impressed.
[56:17.420 --> 56:19.400]  I'm very impressed. I don't want to ever hear that again,
[56:19.460 --> 56:20.280]  but that was pretty cool.
[56:20.720 --> 56:22.060]  I'm gonna go to sleep to it every night.
[56:22.520 --> 56:25.380]  I was really excited, because the only person
[56:25.380 --> 56:26.740]  I can show stuff to is Meg,
[56:27.020 --> 56:28.680]  and I realized
[56:29.260 --> 56:31.340]  ten seconds in that she really wasn't into it,
[56:31.680 --> 56:33.680]  and she just sat there the whole three minutes.
[56:33.840 --> 56:35.600]  I was like, oh, I've misjudged
[56:35.600 --> 56:36.020]  the audience.
[56:37.880 --> 56:39.380]  What did she say about it?
[56:39.480 --> 56:40.600]  She was like, that was really good, Gavin.
[56:40.980 --> 56:41.920]  She doesn't like
[56:43.040 --> 56:43.760]  people gagging.
[56:46.040 --> 56:46.620]  So she
[56:46.620 --> 56:48.240]  just had sort of like a sad face
[56:48.240 --> 56:50.560]  for the whole thing. But that's when I knew
[56:50.560 --> 56:50.960]  I had a winner.
[56:51.780 --> 56:52.440]  Way to go, man.
[56:54.520 --> 56:55.360]  That was great.
[56:56.940 --> 56:58.620]  Anything else for Sausage Talk, or did we
[56:58.620 --> 57:00.560]  do it? I mean, I think
[57:00.560 --> 57:02.480]  we did a pretty good job. We could have talked about
[57:02.480 --> 57:04.080]  the merch that we have coming out, but
[57:04.540 --> 57:05.820]  I don't really need to go into it.
[57:06.360 --> 57:08.400]  Keep your eyes open. There's a ton of new merch
[57:08.400 --> 57:09.660]  coming out, protected by Falcons.
[57:10.320 --> 57:11.460]  Be on the lookout for that.
[57:11.820 --> 57:14.660]  In addition to some other nonsense.
[57:15.080 --> 57:16.080]  So much fucking stuff.
[57:16.540 --> 57:18.080]  When was the last Sausage Talk?
[57:18.880 --> 57:19.460]  Oh, Jesus.
[57:20.540 --> 57:22.620]  Let me find out. Three months ago, maybe?
[57:22.960 --> 57:24.400]  Alright. So this is like a quarterly show.
[57:24.800 --> 57:25.460]  I guess so.
[57:26.280 --> 57:28.120]  Gavin, could you leave the Discord call?
[57:28.660 --> 57:30.140]  Oh, sure. Thank you.
[57:30.180 --> 57:32.480]  Can you hear us twice? It sounds like fucking garbage.
[57:32.660 --> 57:34.360]  Yes, that's so bad. I'm sorry.
[57:34.520 --> 57:36.400]  I didn't realize that Nick fixed
[57:36.400 --> 57:38.860]  it on our end. I'm sorry about that.
[57:38.920 --> 57:39.480]  No, that's okay.
[57:39.800 --> 57:42.420]  Alright, I'm gone. Sausage Talk was
[57:42.420 --> 57:43.920]  the end of
[57:44.660 --> 57:46.040]  September, the beginning of October.
[57:46.320 --> 57:47.460]  So once every six months.
[57:49.900 --> 57:50.340]  But
[57:50.340 --> 57:52.400]  we did skip office days.
[57:52.640 --> 57:54.400]  We did. There was a lot happening
[57:54.400 --> 57:56.400]  that we were in the middle of. There's not always a need
[57:56.400 --> 57:57.220]  for a Sausage Talk.
[57:57.360 --> 58:00.360]  We also used a lot of office days for
[58:00.360 --> 58:01.760]  like beans and pizzas.
[58:02.080 --> 58:04.240]  We also didn't really do a lot of
[58:04.240 --> 58:05.000]  Sausage Talk here.
[58:05.780 --> 58:07.820]  Oh yeah, we did Best of in Falls last time.
[58:08.120 --> 58:08.960]  That was the office day.
[58:09.620 --> 58:11.800]  There you have it. That's Sausage Talk.
[58:12.860 --> 58:14.180]  That's apparently how this show gets
[58:14.180 --> 58:14.420]  made.
[58:18.000 --> 58:18.660]  There you go.
[58:18.960 --> 58:20.200]  Anything else before we
[58:20.200 --> 58:21.940]  wrap up the Sausage Talk? You follow us at
[58:21.940 --> 58:24.120]  FacePod. I mean, if you're listening to this, there's no way
[58:24.120 --> 58:25.040]  that you don't know
[58:25.920 --> 58:27.720]  that. Like, that would be absolutely
[58:27.720 --> 58:29.780]  fucking crazy if this was like the first thing you listened to.
[58:29.900 --> 58:30.380]  That'd be nuts.
[58:31.400 --> 58:32.080]  Um...
[58:33.640 --> 58:34.660]  Come on!
[58:36.180 --> 58:37.400]  That's a communal mic.
[58:37.520 --> 58:38.560]  Goodbye. See you next time.
