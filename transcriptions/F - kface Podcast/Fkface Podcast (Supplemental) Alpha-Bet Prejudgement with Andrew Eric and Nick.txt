[00:04.640 --> 00:07.080]  Okay, so it looks like we're all good all around.
[00:09.200 --> 00:16.200]  So we're on a different Discord channel and Andrew has asked myself and Nick to join him
[00:16.200 --> 00:16.980]  for something.
[00:17.140 --> 00:24.180]  Got a secret weekend message from Andrew about what this is.
[00:24.480 --> 00:26.700]  So Andrew, why do you need us right now?
[00:26.700 --> 00:29.580]  So we're day one of the food bet.
[00:29.780 --> 00:35.200]  As you know, our last recording on Thursday, we drew the numbers, we set the things, and
[00:35.600 --> 00:38.420]  I was talking to Gavin that evening while playing Halo.
[00:38.840 --> 00:43.860]  And I said to Gavin, what percentage of the audience do you think will believe that I
[00:43.860 --> 00:49.220]  somehow rigged the bingo machine to give me a very favorable letter?
[00:49.340 --> 00:53.120]  Because P, I think, is probably the easiest, I haven't gone through it all, but just on
[00:53.120 --> 00:55.420]  surface level, I think it's the easiest.
[00:55.420 --> 00:58.520]  And which Gavin said, well, you did film it, so you're okay.
[00:58.700 --> 01:01.020]  I thought, yeah, you're right, I did record it.
[01:01.520 --> 01:07.940]  What I did learn though, much like we make fun of Geoff's ability to take photos, I should
[01:07.940 --> 01:12.080]  never be allowed to film a video for this show ever again.
[01:12.160 --> 01:16.340]  I'm going to post in our Slack channel, I was having a late night bath, I was like,
[01:16.380 --> 01:16.720]  you know what?
[01:16.780 --> 01:22.240]  I'm going to look at the video I filmed to prove that I drew the number that I did, posting
[01:22.240 --> 01:23.500]  it in the Slack right now.
[01:24.060 --> 01:25.880]  Please watch it and react to it.
[01:26.120 --> 01:30.320]  Okay, Nick, I'm going to hit play in 3, 2, 1.
[01:30.460 --> 01:31.480]  You're going for the third one?
[01:32.320 --> 01:32.660]  Okay.
[01:35.060 --> 01:37.500]  So I'm looking, you have 7 and 21.
[01:39.040 --> 01:40.200]  Gavin and Geoff's number.
[01:40.540 --> 01:41.000]  Got it.
[01:42.460 --> 01:44.060]  It's so loud, by the way.
[01:44.220 --> 01:44.960]  It's so loud.
[01:44.980 --> 01:46.080]  It's incredibly loud.
[01:46.080 --> 01:47.320]  My finger is in the frame.
[01:47.480 --> 01:47.700]  Okay.
[01:48.060 --> 01:51.180]  You do have the numbers in the frame, it's a fine looking video.
[01:51.180 --> 01:52.700]  The number comes...
[01:52.700 --> 01:53.500]  Oh, come on!
[01:55.880 --> 01:56.540]  That's it!
[01:56.640 --> 01:56.800]  Wait!
[01:58.120 --> 01:58.880]  The number...
[01:58.880 --> 01:59.260]  That's it.
[01:59.340 --> 02:00.400]  The number rolled out.
[02:00.480 --> 02:01.240]  You didn't film it.
[02:01.320 --> 02:02.000]  The video cut.
[02:02.840 --> 02:05.060]  Well, the number did roll out.
[02:05.260 --> 02:10.420]  The problem is, I filmed, it bounced out of the shoot and the number is facing the wall
[02:10.420 --> 02:12.960]  the entire time it bounces out.
[02:13.040 --> 02:18.220]  I will post, this is the best, I've scrolled through so many times, this is the best look
[02:18.220 --> 02:20.000]  at the number that I have from the video.
[02:20.400 --> 02:21.880]  This is what we have to work with.
[02:22.100 --> 02:25.460]  I have asked several people to guess the number.
[02:25.940 --> 02:30.820]  I have gotten zero success out of one person, it took them seven guesses to get it.
[02:31.320 --> 02:32.860]  So this is the dilemma I'm in.
[02:33.040 --> 02:38.880]  I was heartbroken when I saw that video, I just went, oh no, I've salad creamed this
[02:38.880 --> 02:39.380]  so hard.
[02:39.620 --> 02:43.400]  This is worse than any photo Geoff has taken in a video form.
[02:43.820 --> 02:44.560]  What do I do?
[02:45.300 --> 02:53.340]  I don't know what you do because I did a recording with Geoff this morning and I said, how's your
[02:53.340 --> 02:54.520]  food going so far?
[02:54.620 --> 02:59.920]  And he groaned and said that he went grocery shopping, bought a lot of things that he thinks
[02:59.920 --> 03:00.700]  start with you.
[03:01.320 --> 03:08.420]  I'm sure that's going to be a whole thing, but he's convinced that you and Gavin are
[03:08.420 --> 03:11.200]  in a prank and pulling a fast one on him.
[03:11.200 --> 03:16.060]  I'm letting you know now because that is what he is sure is happening.
[03:16.200 --> 03:18.680]  So that's why I want to talk to both of you about it.
[03:18.740 --> 03:22.180]  I didn't want to talk to them because they're in competition with me right now for this
[03:22.180 --> 03:22.440]  bet.
[03:22.780 --> 03:27.380]  You two are, I feel like, are the closest we have to a neutral party that could also
[03:27.380 --> 03:28.300]  kind of make a ruling.
[03:28.660 --> 03:30.720]  What would you do in my position?
[03:32.100 --> 03:32.940]  With everything...
[03:34.660 --> 03:36.860]  Well, here's the thing.
[03:36.920 --> 03:38.740]  I would never be in your position, Andrew.
[03:38.740 --> 03:39.620]  No, that's fair.
[03:39.760 --> 03:40.580]  That's totally fair.
[03:40.580 --> 03:41.740]  Like, ever.
[03:41.940 --> 03:42.860]  Let me explain.
[03:43.160 --> 03:44.000]  So this is what happened.
[03:44.380 --> 03:49.100]  One of the reasons why the video is so bad is because the surface of the bingo machine
[03:49.100 --> 03:50.020]  is reflective.
[03:50.600 --> 03:54.400]  And I recorded in my underwear yesterday, or last time we did it.
[03:54.540 --> 03:58.700]  I did not want to appear in my underwear on the video.
[03:59.060 --> 04:00.480]  So that's why it's so low.
[04:00.540 --> 04:02.620]  It's to the least reflective part of the machine.
[04:02.880 --> 04:08.380]  And I am standing technically in my bathroom, stretched out to get the thing.
[04:08.810 --> 04:13.060]  I did not, as soon as it bounced out the chute, I didn't want to film the entirety of my room,
[04:13.140 --> 04:14.040]  so I canceled it.
[04:14.380 --> 04:19.160]  I didn't realize that I didn't capture it in frame at all, because it sat on the upper
[04:19.160 --> 04:20.960]  part before falling for a little bit.
[04:21.400 --> 04:24.140]  It wasn't until I watched the video I realized, oh, this is a problem.
[04:24.540 --> 04:25.720]  This is really not good.
[04:26.040 --> 04:27.660]  This proves nothing.
[04:28.180 --> 04:28.240]  Yeah.
[04:28.460 --> 04:28.540]  No.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.660]  Um, I just, I don't even know.
[04:34.260 --> 04:35.100]  I don't...
[04:36.680 --> 04:37.700]  What can you say?
[04:39.720 --> 04:41.020]  I don't know.
[04:41.520 --> 04:45.600]  Could we, is there like, you know, in CSI, they enhance the, can we do that?
[04:46.000 --> 04:46.420]  Do we know?
[04:46.500 --> 04:48.100]  I don't think that technology is real.
[04:48.500 --> 04:53.720]  So you think, so you showed this to a bunch of people and nobody guessed, nobody guessed
[04:53.720 --> 04:54.120]  your letter.
[04:54.560 --> 04:59.260]  I've shown it to three or four, and one person eventually got, I didn't say you were wrong
[04:59.260 --> 05:03.380]  to the person, I just let them keep guessing, took them about five, they eventually got
[05:03.380 --> 05:03.960]  to 16.
[05:04.380 --> 05:05.720]  I've got a lot of 18.
[05:05.840 --> 05:06.240]  Yep.
[05:06.320 --> 05:06.480]  Okay.
[05:06.720 --> 05:12.640]  I've gotten, once you know it's between 1 and 26, people generally say like an 18.
[05:12.820 --> 05:14.380]  It looks like, because the 6 is in motion.
[05:14.800 --> 05:15.100]  Yes.
[05:15.220 --> 05:15.820]  100% looks like it.
[05:15.840 --> 05:16.920]  The 6 is in motion.
[05:17.560 --> 05:18.800]  So it looks like an 8.
[05:19.260 --> 05:24.620]  I think if you know it's 16 and you look at it, you can see the 16, but without the context
[05:24.620 --> 05:28.240]  of it, um, I think I'm going to get killed no matter what I do.
[05:28.240 --> 05:33.500]  I think you're absolutely, I think Gavin will let you live.
[05:33.500 --> 05:37.860]  I think Geoff is going to be furious.
[05:38.520 --> 05:39.100]  Oh, absolutely.
[05:39.620 --> 05:45.960]  I don't know another way out of it other than, than re-filming.
[05:46.840 --> 05:51.980]  Yes, but I don't want to lose P. I got P. If I got any other letter, I'd just be like,
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.280]  I'll do it again, but I got P. I don't want to screw myself out of P.
[05:55.560 --> 05:56.300]  I agree.
[05:56.540 --> 06:00.700]  I don't think, I think you have to stick with P. I don't know what you can do.
[06:01.380 --> 06:05.320]  I think you just have to hold to your bet and then wait for them to see.
[06:05.980 --> 06:11.820]  I think you just have to wait for them to see that you did not quite capture it on video
[06:11.820 --> 06:14.320]  and you have to take your lumps.
[06:14.680 --> 06:15.160]  Oh, yeah.
[06:15.460 --> 06:18.000]  Because of course it happened this way.
[06:18.140 --> 06:21.020]  It might, this might be my get out of Greg Freach card.
[06:21.240 --> 06:23.520]  This might have to be played here depending on how it goes.
[06:23.920 --> 06:25.180]  You definitely might have to play.
[06:25.220 --> 06:25.940]  See, here's the thing.
[06:26.020 --> 06:29.700]  I don't think Gavin is going to hold your feet to the fire that hard.
[06:30.020 --> 06:30.560]  I agree.
[06:30.820 --> 06:33.160]  Because he got an okay letter.
[06:33.400 --> 06:34.040]  Yes.
[06:34.120 --> 06:38.440]  I think this might, I think Geoff is so upset with his letter.
[06:38.600 --> 06:47.280]  I mean, was complaining to Gus about it this morning because he's so upset that his bet
[06:47.280 --> 06:48.680]  went this wrong.
[06:51.360 --> 06:56.700]  And it just, it almost adds to the suspicion of it all because we all got perfect letters
[06:56.700 --> 06:58.740]  in a sense of Gavin gets a G.
[06:58.740 --> 07:05.440]  Geoff specifically talks about in like an extended way, how bad it would be to get you in the
[07:05.440 --> 07:06.860]  episode that just released.
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.780]  And I specifically mentioned how great P would be.
[07:09.840 --> 07:10.520]  I'd love P.
[07:11.500 --> 07:12.300]  Oh no.
[07:12.640 --> 07:13.320]  And I pull it.
[07:13.520 --> 07:17.440]  So it's just, it's like everything lines up that this would be in somehow staged.
[07:18.080 --> 07:21.140]  And my evidence that it isn't is dreadful.
[07:21.240 --> 07:21.440]  Yeah.
[07:21.580 --> 07:23.460]  This might be the most I've salad creamed anything.
[07:24.040 --> 07:24.760]  I agree.
[07:25.020 --> 07:28.360]  You might, you might be boned and you might just have to take your lumps on this one,
[07:28.360 --> 07:28.560]  bud.
[07:28.620 --> 07:29.380]  You might be done for.
[07:29.860 --> 07:30.140]  It's one.
[07:30.260 --> 07:31.460]  So this is sort of my thought.
[07:31.780 --> 07:36.920]  If they're upset, which I assume Geoff definitely will be, I either, cause I feel like it's
[07:36.920 --> 07:40.720]  undeniably a one in the front of it because it has to be one to 26.
[07:40.880 --> 07:41.400]  It's not a two.
[07:41.580 --> 07:43.360]  And then it becomes a 16 or an 18.
[07:43.760 --> 07:49.940]  I'd be willing to do another week where I do R if people think it's an R instead of a
[07:49.940 --> 07:52.860]  P with the 18 or a redraw.
[07:53.120 --> 07:54.520]  I think both things would be fair.
[07:54.520 --> 07:59.600]  I think that you could present that to them, but only when it gets to dire straights.
[07:59.680 --> 08:00.600]  Yes, I agree.
[08:00.840 --> 08:03.400]  It would be a lot to throw your mercy yourself upon the mercy of the court.
[08:03.480 --> 08:07.260]  I think I would argue if they want me to redraw, then we all have to do another week if we're
[08:07.260 --> 08:07.780]  doing a redraw.
[08:07.860 --> 08:08.540]  Oh, I don't know.
[08:08.600 --> 08:09.680]  I don't think Geoff will do that.
[08:09.740 --> 08:10.900]  I think he's too shell-shocked.
[08:11.180 --> 08:13.560]  Maybe if he gets to take the P. Yep.
[08:13.860 --> 08:14.480]  Just automatically.
[08:15.320 --> 08:15.560]  Mmm.
[08:15.920 --> 08:16.220]  Mmm.
[08:16.660 --> 08:17.020]  Mmm.
[08:17.660 --> 08:18.360]  That's a tough one.
[08:18.700 --> 08:18.900]  Yeah.
[08:19.080 --> 08:20.040]  So I just want it.
[08:20.060 --> 08:21.000]  I want to hear your thoughts.
[08:21.120 --> 08:23.740]  I wanted to see how screwed you thought I was.
[08:23.740 --> 08:24.940]  I don't know where this will fit.
[08:25.060 --> 08:27.780]  If this is in an episode, if this is a side weird thing.
[08:27.840 --> 08:28.240]  I don't know.
[08:28.340 --> 08:31.660]  I just wanted to have this talk since you both are sort of neutral.
[08:32.080 --> 08:35.160]  I would say decision makers in this process.
[08:35.280 --> 08:37.100]  Nick, what do you think should happen?
[08:37.500 --> 08:38.140]  Oh, man.
[08:38.180 --> 08:43.640]  I think we should extend another week and you should either honestly, the R is not a
[08:43.640 --> 08:47.940]  bad way to go because the 18 does seem to be the thing here, but I'm willing to bet that
[08:47.940 --> 08:51.960]  Geoff will be the one to decide this and he's going to make you he's going to make you put
[08:51.960 --> 08:54.640]  the you back in there and redo the whole thing.
[08:58.060 --> 09:00.320]  That I'm going to have to agree with Nick.
[09:00.420 --> 09:03.980]  I don't think Geoff wants to do another week.
[09:04.340 --> 09:08.900]  However, he might force you to do another draw with the you.
[09:09.180 --> 09:12.280]  I do think that that is probably what's going to happen.
[09:13.320 --> 09:15.180]  We'll see. I just wanted this on record.
[09:15.300 --> 09:18.760]  I want to have a conversation about the issues, the salad creaming that occurred.
[09:18.760 --> 09:23.600]  And I'm excited to see what their reaction will be on Thursday when we record.
[09:23.740 --> 09:26.820]  And I'm sure I will. I will show them the video and discuss this as well.
[09:26.940 --> 09:32.600]  I think that this should go out as an independent piece that goes out like right before
[09:32.600 --> 09:37.400]  the actual podcast. Like this needs to come out after we do the draw.
[09:37.700 --> 09:43.580]  Yes. But before the like you guys talking about what you ate, because I'm so curious.
[09:43.580 --> 09:49.840]  Should I post the photo of the ball in motion on like Thursday or Wednesday?
[09:50.040 --> 09:52.940]  I guess Wednesday when it comes out publicly and just ask what people see.
[09:53.300 --> 09:56.940]  So, yeah, OK. Oh, man, I don't want to spoil anything.
[09:57.180 --> 09:59.640]  I just want to see. No, no. Yeah, no, I know.
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.880]  I don't think you will. Also,
[10:04.720 --> 10:08.460]  also, this might be a real way where people will see if it's 16.
[10:08.540 --> 10:12.600]  Like if people see 16 a bunch of times, then maybe you can get off
[10:12.960 --> 10:15.900]  scot-free. But also, I don't I don't foresee that happening.
[10:16.060 --> 10:18.840]  Well, you should I agree the picture all the way upside down and see if they see 21.
[10:19.380 --> 10:21.200]  Yeah, really? Oh, man.
[10:21.600 --> 10:22.560]  Well, there you go.
[10:22.660 --> 10:26.180]  I guess we'll have to see what Gavin and Geoff say, because I'm excited to find out.
[10:26.380 --> 10:28.760]  Oh, they're going to be so as you said, I don't think Gavin will be upset.
[10:28.880 --> 10:30.040]  Geoff is going to want to kill me.
[10:30.120 --> 10:31.260]  Geoff is going to want to kill you.
[10:31.600 --> 10:34.820]  Livid. Yeah. Thank you so much for your guys's ruling.
[10:35.220 --> 10:36.780]  I'm excited to see how it goes on Thursday.
[10:37.120 --> 10:38.640]  Me, too. All right. Good luck.
[10:38.640 --> 10:41.220]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
