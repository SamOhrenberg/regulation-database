[00:00.000 --> 00:03.900]  Hey, it's Andrew. I'm just setting the stage for this announcement.
[00:04.320 --> 00:07.740]  First of all, it's good. This isn't bad. I know seeing a thing that's just called
[00:07.740 --> 00:13.300]  the announcement must be terrifying. This is ridiculous great news that you're about to hear.
[00:14.080 --> 00:19.420]  This is something that was recorded back in December. It has been in the works for quite a
[00:19.420 --> 00:29.860]  while, and I'm so excited that we could finally talk about it. This is, if you remember quite a
[00:29.860 --> 00:34.800]  with everyone. And I said that if we couldn't release it, then we'd edit it and put it out
[00:34.800 --> 00:41.100]  later. It is now a time we can release it. Get ready for an announcement that is absurd that I
[00:41.100 --> 00:46.060]  can't wait for you to hear. And I will be back on the back end just to clarify because I don't
[00:46.060 --> 00:51.800]  remember necessarily the specifics of what's talked about, but just to clear up the details
[00:51.800 --> 00:55.700]  of what exactly this announcement entails. Thank you so much. Love you. Bye.
[01:05.760 --> 01:10.280]  You know what we can record is your thing that you wanted to talk about. Go for it.
[01:10.280 --> 01:17.580]  Okay. So recently talking about Let's Plays, we recorded a Let's Play and none other than
[01:17.580 --> 01:23.000]  the game of the year, Raty Boy, Ratty Boy, everyone's favorite, tiny little rat,
[01:23.320 --> 01:27.880]  cute little guy. Everyone loves him. Great character, great personality. Nick's on board.
[01:28.420 --> 01:33.080]  It's changed my way how I view weights. Whenever I see weights now, I think of Raty Boy and his
[01:33.080 --> 01:40.940]  struggle with climbing. So obviously that was so much fun making that video. It was a disaster.
[01:41.160 --> 01:46.840]  I was dying. Nick was dying. Gavin got sick. Eric was annoyed. It was perfect. It was a perfect
[01:46.840 --> 01:50.340]  video. You can watch it now on Let's Play as well. You can, yes. You can watch it on the YouTube
[01:50.340 --> 01:55.680]  channel. You can watch it on First. But I was curious because I was like, this is such a
[01:55.680 --> 02:00.340]  ridiculous game. Who made this? Like, that's one of the things I love about the game is there's
[02:00.340 --> 02:05.780]  no credits on it. It just, you see like a developer, but you can't, I couldn't find anyone
[02:05.780 --> 02:12.320]  that had credit towards Raty Boy that had it, that like claimed I made this. And so I did some
[02:12.320 --> 02:18.880]  research and I found out it was made by a company named 909 Games and it was published by a company
[02:18.880 --> 02:25.840]  called Weakfish Studios. And so I reached out to Weakfish Studios. I was like, hey, could you,
[02:25.840 --> 02:32.580]  could you put me in touch with anyone at 909 Games? I would just, I'd love to, I'd love to
[02:32.580 --> 02:38.180]  talk to them just in like any aspect. Like, I just, I can't find anything on who these people
[02:38.180 --> 02:45.480]  are. And they replied, 909 Games is an internal studio within us. We're technically 909 Games.
[02:45.640 --> 02:52.300]  It's all the same. And I said, that's fantastic. I would like to buy the Raty Boy IP from you
[02:52.300 --> 03:00.480]  and completely own the rights of the character Raty Boy. And that was, that was their reply,
[03:00.720 --> 03:07.800]  Eric, was what? What are you, what are you talking about? This is unexpected. Why? Like,
[03:07.820 --> 03:13.640]  what are you offering? And so I've been planning this for a few days now. I've been going back
[03:13.640 --> 03:21.620]  and forth with the guy that owns, owns Weakfish, trying to secure the rights to Raty Boy. Now,
[03:21.620 --> 03:28.880]  originally, originally it was full, just, I own the character from this point forward. But then
[03:28.880 --> 03:33.480]  that, that wasn't, I couldn't offer a lot as a person for that. So we're looking at more of like
[03:33.480 --> 03:40.340]  a Spider-Man deal situation where we would have the rights to Raty Boy in every context outside
[03:40.340 --> 03:46.100]  of video games, but they continue to make Raty Boy games and that's their life. So I've been
[03:46.100 --> 03:49.580]  active negotiations. It's kind of cooled off a little bit recently. I was hoping to have this
[03:49.580 --> 03:57.280]  closed. But I wrote a press release for us to post on social to announce our big character acquisition
[03:57.820 --> 04:04.260]  if it were to take place. And there is no better way to celebrate an acquisition
[04:04.780 --> 04:11.000]  than with a t-shirt. So I reached out to our good friend Tony about coordinating a shirt
[04:11.580 --> 04:18.220]  that we could, that we could release at launch. And so it's your, you know, you're,
[04:19.160 --> 04:24.120]  you're a rat, Eric. You love rats. So this is the, the, the original design I had mocked up.
[04:24.240 --> 04:30.280]  I gave some instruction. This is what we came up with. We had to pick between one or the other.
[04:36.180 --> 04:39.660]  Some great options, wonderful art by Tobin.
[04:53.820 --> 05:02.300]  Very shortly after I got a finalized version of the shirts, I said which one I wanted.
[05:02.300 --> 05:05.920]  So we have a variety to pick from.
[05:09.680 --> 05:13.500]  Unfortunately, red was not available as a print on demand. So these are the two shirts
[05:13.500 --> 05:18.860]  that will ultimately be available if I am able to close this deal, which it has gone a little
[05:18.860 --> 05:26.240]  bit cold these last few days. It is the holidays. If we don't get it, should we just sell that
[05:26.240 --> 05:31.720]  shirt with like redacted over Ratiboy's face? Well, I'd just change him to fucking Bart Simpson.
[05:32.000 --> 05:38.780]  I hate him. I hate him. So, I mean, I don't know why, because you're number one ratty,
[05:38.820 --> 05:42.920]  Ratiboy's clearly, as it says, you guys love each other. You're always hanging out.
[05:43.340 --> 05:50.420]  I don't want him. This, I hate it. You have the chance to be friends with an IP, Eric. Look how,
[05:50.520 --> 05:55.980]  look how much you love Ratiboy on that t-shirt. I hate, I hate Ratiboy. I hate him so
[05:55.980 --> 06:02.400]  much. You know what? You know what? We were never able to successfully secure IP for the
[06:02.400 --> 06:08.680]  Smashing Sportsman. Maybe Ratiboy is our superhero protector. That was my thought. I don't want Ratiboy.
[06:08.940 --> 06:15.620]  Give him back. Give him back to the studio. We're trying to. I wrote a press release. I emailed
[06:15.620 --> 06:24.360]  Jordan Levin about this. I wanted to see if he wanted to provide a quote about our
[06:24.360 --> 06:28.660]  exciting acquisition, if it were to happen. And he very politely declined, which I respect.
[06:28.940 --> 06:35.140]  You don't say. An actual businessman? Yeah. Yeah. So this is, well, it's, this is business. I have
[06:35.140 --> 06:39.920]  a press release. I'm about to read right here. Ratiboy's news release. It is with great excitement
[06:39.920 --> 06:44.660]  we here at F*** Face announced something truly spectacular. In entertainment, whether we're
[06:44.660 --> 06:49.480]  talking movies, sports, or games, the need for iconic characters has never been more essential.
[06:49.480 --> 06:55.240]  It's very rare for an iconic character to be available, but I'm thrilled to say that Andrew
[06:55.240 --> 07:00.240]  Payton and the amazing team at Weakfish Studios have come to an agreement on an industry-changing
[07:00.240 --> 07:05.580]  deal. From this point onward, all IP rights outside of video games for everyone's favorite
[07:05.580 --> 07:10.860]  rat, Ratiboy, belong to Andrew Payton. Weakfish will continue to support and own the video game
[07:10.860 --> 07:15.800]  side of creating excellent Ratiboy games that we are excited to see in the future.
[07:16.540 --> 07:20.520]  Uh, we wish them nothing but the best in the future, and what this means for us at F*** Face
[07:20.520 --> 07:25.940]  and Uniform is the immediate inclusion of the greatest rat ever seen into our family. The
[07:25.940 --> 07:30.900]  future has never looked brighter for Ratiboy, so to celebrate this monumental day, allow me to
[07:30.900 --> 07:36.640]  reveal this launch reveal shirt. It features our new hero alongside his number one fan, Eric Badour.
[07:37.020 --> 07:42.540]  We're so excited to deepen the Ratiboy lore and hope you're excited as we are for the future
[07:42.540 --> 07:47.300]  as it comes. Long live the number one rat game. Long live the number one rat.
[07:47.740 --> 07:54.180]  Long live Ratiboy. Sincerely, F*** Face. So that is what I've been up to. I don't know if this
[07:54.180 --> 07:58.840]  deal will close by then, so I wanted to put this at the end of the show, so if we need to edit it,
[07:58.960 --> 08:04.920]  and I'm hoping it will come to and we'll figure it out. I wonder if the Warner Discovery stock
[08:04.920 --> 08:12.320]  will go up when the acquisition hits the news. Andrew, you are just the gift that keeps on giving.
[08:12.500 --> 08:18.540]  What a visionary. It's going to be ideas like this that lead us to success in the future.
[08:18.660 --> 08:24.300]  Thank you so much. Of course. I like that he's, once again, deploying people all over the company
[08:24.960 --> 08:32.340]  and also emailing... The general manager? Emailing the head of Ristanteel, who, you know,
[08:32.340 --> 08:38.020]  has tons going on all the time. Uh-huh. Yeah, I did. Can you provide a quote for
[08:38.020 --> 08:49.400]  Ratiboy Adventures? We might get him. What? Who? What? Oh my god. Oh, that shirt. Oh, I hate him.
[08:49.800 --> 08:54.580]  I hate him so much. I hate him. I'm glad. Have you thought about one of the things you want to,
[08:54.620 --> 08:59.160]  like, how you want to expand the Ratiboy universe, Andrew? I mean, we could do so much,
[08:59.520 --> 09:03.420]  because we can do shirts. We could do... Ratiboy technically doesn't have a voice.
[09:03.620 --> 09:07.740]  Eric could be the voice of Ratiboy. Yeah, we could do narratives. We could do radio plays. We could
[09:07.740 --> 09:12.660]  do comics. Like, there's no end of... And so much we could do. Yeah. He could even show up in our
[09:12.660 --> 09:19.080]  smut. Oh, I wonder what kind of surprises we'll have in the smut. Who knows who will show up in
[09:19.080 --> 09:26.120]  our smut? This sucks. Insane. I want to see an Ian Ratiboy face. That's what I want to see.
[09:30.440 --> 09:39.240]  Oh, God. Merry Christmas, Eric. Yeah, thanks, man. What a way to... What a way to end the year
[09:39.240 --> 09:44.980]  and ring in the new one just with this insane shit that somehow has found its way to me.
[09:47.760 --> 09:54.020]  Jesus Christ. So if you're listening to this and you're not 100% sure what's going on,
[09:54.100 --> 09:58.420]  you should really watch the Ratiboy Let's Play over on the Let's Play YouTube channel
[09:58.420 --> 10:03.640]  or on the Rooster Teeth channel. It's one of the better ones we've done. And they're all good,
[10:03.740 --> 10:08.020]  don't get me wrong, but this one's like a good plus. Also, buy the shirt. It will be available
[10:08.020 --> 10:13.560]  if you're listening to this. It is ready to launch. You think the deal's going to be closed
[10:13.560 --> 10:19.280]  by then? Well, if it is, it might... Like, it'll be very quick. Like, everything is ready to deploy
[10:19.280 --> 10:25.460]  all of this. It's just I need an agreement with them. And look forward to the... Sometime in 2025,
[10:25.460 --> 10:28.980]  the Ratiboy graphic novel. It's just like KenKen, but he's a rat.
[10:31.760 --> 10:35.580]  If you're wondering when all of this is recorded and if we know if there's a deal,
[10:35.880 --> 10:43.300]  in the middle of this, I tweeted, I hate Ratiboy, I hate him. So find that. That's
[10:43.300 --> 10:49.620]  where it is being explained to me that I'm on a shirt with this little fuck. This sucks.
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.200]  I'm so excited for the beginning of phase one of the Ratiboy universe.
[10:53.200 --> 10:59.040]  Oh, hey, guys, let's not overdo it by phase four like Marvel did. Let's learn from their mistakes.
[10:59.320 --> 11:03.620]  Absolutely. Yeah, we got to treat this. We got to treat this IP preciously.
[11:03.760 --> 11:09.300]  We can't just be cranking out Ratiboy shit. God, that shirt just means so little to
[11:09.840 --> 11:14.660]  most of the planet. To so many. Never has a shirt meant so little to so many.
[11:22.560 --> 11:28.160]  Oh, fuck. Oh, my God. I love it so much.
[11:30.080 --> 11:37.120]  Well, bye. Well, we already said goodbye, so we can just stop talking. Yeah.
[11:39.200 --> 11:45.960]  Hey, so just to clarify the the finer points of the deal now that it is done and locked in,
[11:45.960 --> 11:51.700]  we acquired the media and merchandising rights for Ratiboy. Well, Weakfish still has all the video
[11:51.700 --> 11:56.380]  game stuff. They're going to continue to make great games with Ratiboy that I'm so excited to
[11:56.380 --> 12:02.380]  see what will be next. And we have the ability to implement him into our other content as well as
[12:02.380 --> 12:10.000]  merch. And it's going to be the greatest mascot that anyone's ever seen. So get excited for that.
[12:10.080 --> 12:14.260]  I know I am. I can't believe that this is the thing that came together. I love how much it
[12:14.260 --> 12:18.380]  annoys Eric. It's just all around one of the best things that could have happened.
[12:18.640 --> 12:23.280]  So thank you so much for supporting us and allowing us to do these crazy things that we do.
[12:23.480 --> 12:27.500]  I hope you enjoyed this and I hope you're as excited about all of this as we are.
[12:27.680 --> 12:30.680]  It's totally ridiculous. Once again, love you. Bye.
