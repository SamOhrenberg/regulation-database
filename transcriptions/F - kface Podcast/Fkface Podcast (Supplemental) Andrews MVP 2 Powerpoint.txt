[00:14.980 --> 00:20.440]  Hello and welcome to another piece of supplemental content for the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:20.800 --> 00:25.100]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, with me as always, Andrew Pant and Gavin Free, somewhere in the
[00:25.100 --> 00:27.740]  back, Eric and Nick, I believe, are hanging out.
[00:28.080 --> 00:35.980]  And I'm excited about this one, fellas, because this recording is nine, approximately nine
[00:35.980 --> 00:37.500]  months in the making, I would say.
[00:38.220 --> 00:39.040]  Somewhere around there.
[00:39.040 --> 00:40.780]  I'd love to know how many times we rescheduled this.
[00:41.140 --> 00:41.900]  At least six.
[00:41.960 --> 00:43.700]  Eric, how many times have we rescheduled this?
[00:43.880 --> 00:48.100]  I think everyone got at least two in where we rescheduled it.
[00:48.360 --> 00:51.260]  Gavin might only be responsible for one, but I don't remember.
[00:51.580 --> 00:52.240]  But it was rescheduled.
[00:52.260 --> 00:52.460]  No, I'm one.
[00:53.100 --> 00:54.340]  I was gonna be quiet.
[00:54.420 --> 00:55.540]  I only rescheduled once.
[00:55.600 --> 00:56.740]  I'm not giving Gavin the one.
[00:56.800 --> 00:57.320]  Okay, that's good.
[00:57.320 --> 00:57.620]  He did not have that.
[00:57.640 --> 00:57.940]  That's good.
[00:57.980 --> 00:59.380]  He was gonna be quiet.
[00:59.820 --> 01:03.900]  Well, I'm gonna be honest and say I'm two or three, and I don't feel like I was the
[01:03.900 --> 01:04.440]  worst offender.
[01:04.800 --> 01:05.420]  I think I'm two.
[01:06.280 --> 01:06.500]  Yeah.
[01:07.200 --> 01:08.320]  At least six.
[01:09.920 --> 01:11.620]  Regardless, I will say this.
[01:11.700 --> 01:16.640]  We recorded the latest episode of F*** Face yesterday, I believe it was 1-27, and after
[01:16.640 --> 01:21.060]  it we realized this was on the calendar, and everybody wanted to record the Monkey Movie
[01:21.060 --> 01:22.140]  today except for Andrew.
[01:22.400 --> 01:25.560]  So we didn't let him reschedule it, but he did try.
[01:25.740 --> 01:29.820]  He did try yesterday to say, let's keep the recording slot, but record more F*** Face
[01:29.820 --> 01:30.200]  instead.
[01:30.200 --> 01:37.380]  I suspect that's because the 98% that he said he was done on the presentation was more like
[01:37.380 --> 01:38.140]  8%.
[01:38.140 --> 01:41.760]  And now that you're yawning, it makes me think you pulled an all-nighter.
[01:42.460 --> 01:44.920]  No, it was done by the time that happened.
[01:45.180 --> 01:50.440]  Sorry, I want this show to release every single week it's supposed to, and Gavin previously
[01:50.440 --> 01:56.360]  said, we better be ready by the end of October, because he's out all of November, which isn't
[01:56.360 --> 01:56.740]  the case.
[01:56.760 --> 01:57.500]  It's not the case at all.
[01:57.500 --> 01:59.160]  It's not my fault.
[01:59.160 --> 02:02.100]  It's not my fault that I was just going based off of what I was told, and I was concerned
[02:02.100 --> 02:04.080]  about the listeners being able to get the show.
[02:04.460 --> 02:06.940]  I apologize for prioritizing their entertainment.
[02:07.420 --> 02:08.980]  Your frickin' dock, dude.
[02:09.200 --> 02:11.460]  You've got like four incompatible apps.
[02:11.560 --> 02:12.880]  You got two question marks.
[02:14.140 --> 02:15.180]  It's the anxiety.
[02:15.200 --> 02:16.100]  The dock is gonna be great.
[02:16.460 --> 02:17.560]  The dock is fantastic.
[02:17.800 --> 02:19.840]  I would hate to see what your desktop looks like.
[02:20.640 --> 02:21.000]  Oh, you wanna see?
[02:21.000 --> 02:22.340]  I think we've seen that before.
[02:22.840 --> 02:23.840]  You wanna see what it looks like right now?
[02:23.880 --> 02:24.060]  Yeah.
[02:24.280 --> 02:25.060]  What do we got?
[02:25.160 --> 02:26.000]  Minimize this, please.
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.920]  Yeah, we're dropping out of that, dropping out of that.
[02:29.000 --> 02:30.260]  Oh, that's not terrible.
[02:30.560 --> 02:31.800]  Nah, it's pretty good.
[02:31.800 --> 02:32.400]  That's pretty good.
[02:32.500 --> 02:32.680]  Can you rearrange it?
[02:33.000 --> 02:33.400]  Yeah, it's not too bad.
[02:33.400 --> 02:34.540]  Is that a picture of your fingers?
[02:35.460 --> 02:36.480]  I don't know what that was.
[02:36.560 --> 02:40.660]  Oh, that was me complaining about a break shit and what the feed was for me and what
[02:40.660 --> 02:41.640]  my perspective was.
[02:42.340 --> 02:44.220]  I was trying to be like, this is the quality I had.
[02:44.660 --> 02:46.820]  Is that a picture of Vancouver Island, where you live?
[02:47.160 --> 02:48.460]  No, I don't know what that is.
[02:48.500 --> 02:50.600]  It's just the standard Mac thing.
[02:51.440 --> 02:51.800]  Okay.
[02:52.480 --> 02:52.780]  Okay.
[02:52.780 --> 02:57.660]  So, now that we're at an indeterminate amount of time into the supplemental content, I realize
[02:57.660 --> 02:58.760]  we haven't said what it is.
[02:59.280 --> 03:02.100]  What we're going to be doing is this is going to be content in two parts.
[03:02.500 --> 03:06.760]  We've been talking about watching the movie MVP 2 for a very long time.
[03:06.920 --> 03:08.200]  We're finally going to do it.
[03:08.340 --> 03:09.320]  It's about a monkey.
[03:09.640 --> 03:12.760]  That's about as much as we know, highly influential to Andrew as a child.
[03:13.260 --> 03:18.560]  But before we wanted to watch MVP 2, Gavin and I felt like we needed a primer on MVP 1
[03:18.560 --> 03:23.040]  because we don't want to be lost in the weeds trying to catch up on old storylines.
[03:23.420 --> 03:27.540]  So Andrew, the first piece of this content, Andrew is going to give us his recitation,
[03:27.980 --> 03:33.620]  his distilled summary of what MVP 1 was all about.
[03:33.880 --> 03:34.100]  Andrew?
[03:34.400 --> 03:36.140]  Yeah, this is an important lead-in.
[03:36.500 --> 03:37.460]  The doc has been made.
[03:37.540 --> 03:39.040]  I'm excited to share this with you.
[03:39.120 --> 03:43.680]  This is going to just go over kind of the broad strokes of the movie because I realized
[03:43.680 --> 03:49.200]  while re-watching this to gather these images, the second movie has little to nothing to
[03:49.200 --> 03:50.560]  do with the first movie.
[03:50.920 --> 03:51.620]  So we don't need this?
[03:52.060 --> 03:53.640]  No, it's completely pointless.
[03:53.880 --> 03:57.240]  You're really gaining no additional information from this experience.
[03:57.600 --> 04:02.920]  The movie ends in a completely different spot than the second one begins.
[04:03.460 --> 04:04.880]  We get right into the middle of the action.
[04:05.340 --> 04:10.480]  So would you say MVP 2 is more of like a soft reboot, kind of like Evil Dead to Evil Dead 2 kind of thing?
[04:10.480 --> 04:16.700]  I would say so, but I haven't watched MVP 2 since I was probably 10, and I'm terrified
[04:16.700 --> 04:21.140]  that it's going to be a boring, terrible movie and that this is just all around the worst idea.
[04:21.140 --> 04:23.300]  Will any of this be presented in Dubox?
[04:23.680 --> 04:24.380]  Ah, no.
[04:24.540 --> 04:25.460]  I should have.
[04:25.480 --> 04:26.380]  I should have went through.
[04:26.520 --> 04:27.680]  Yeah, that's on me.
[04:27.760 --> 04:28.440]  That's my failing.
[04:28.600 --> 04:29.000]  No worries.
[04:29.080 --> 04:29.420]  No worries.
[04:29.520 --> 04:30.160]  Yeah, that's on me.
[04:30.680 --> 04:33.680]  So should we begin this presentation of MVP?
[04:34.120 --> 04:35.740]  I believe this movie came out in 98.
[04:35.900 --> 04:36.680]  That could be wrong.
[04:36.940 --> 04:37.360]  Could be opening.
[04:37.420 --> 04:38.460]  I'm sorry, real quick.
[04:38.460 --> 04:43.960]  If you're listening to this and you want to see Andrew's slideshow, go to the f***face
[04:43.960 --> 04:44.480]  YouTube.
[04:44.700 --> 04:49.480]  In the video version of this supplemental piece of content will be Andrew's full slideshow.
[04:49.600 --> 04:51.400]  Just wanted to let everyone know what was going on.
[04:51.760 --> 04:54.400]  Looks like it looks like a movie came out in 2000, by the way.
[04:54.840 --> 04:55.800]  OK, 2000.
[04:55.980 --> 04:56.220]  Great.
[04:56.300 --> 05:00.380]  If you guys have any questions or want to interject, feel free to interrupt at any time.
[05:00.380 --> 05:09.580]  But we shall begin with MVP, Most Valuable Primate, a presentation by me, Andrew Pantin.
[05:09.920 --> 05:12.020]  On to slide number two.
[05:14.380 --> 05:16.220]  But before that, Banana Wipe!
[05:16.360 --> 05:17.020]  Look at all the bananas!
[05:17.260 --> 05:18.080]  Bananas coming down!
[05:18.440 --> 05:19.160]  Bananas falling!
[05:19.560 --> 05:20.500]  We got the Banana Wipe!
[05:20.820 --> 05:21.120]  Oh!
[05:21.380 --> 05:22.340]  Look down, it's raining bananas!
[05:22.780 --> 05:23.220]  Look out!
[05:23.420 --> 05:24.320]  Oh, it's coming through!
[05:24.720 --> 05:25.640]  It's coming through with the banana!
[05:25.820 --> 05:26.500]  You f***ing...
[05:26.500 --> 05:29.340]  You salad creamed that Banana Wipe so goddamn hard.
[05:29.340 --> 05:31.040]  No, the tech wasn't there.
[05:31.160 --> 05:32.580]  I was limited with what could be done.
[05:32.780 --> 05:33.960]  That's the best Banana Wipe we got.
[05:34.280 --> 05:37.480]  But here, we begin the motion picture with Jack.
[05:37.660 --> 05:41.760]  It's the story of Jack, and you may be wondering, is it Minor League Fan Jack?
[05:42.240 --> 05:43.740]  No, it's not.
[05:43.920 --> 05:46.000]  Is it Famous Jack, Black Jack?
[05:46.200 --> 05:47.440]  No, it's not him either.
[05:47.820 --> 05:52.240]  Maybe it's Jack Johnson, who did make a monkey movie, but it's not this monkey movie.
[05:52.580 --> 05:55.640]  This story is about Jack, this monkey.
[05:56.180 --> 05:56.880]  That's Jack.
[05:56.880 --> 06:00.020]  He sleeps in a college, he lays in bed, he's very comfortable.
[06:01.020 --> 06:03.940]  Is he a chimpanzee?
[06:04.000 --> 06:04.960]  He's a chimpanzee.
[06:05.100 --> 06:06.360]  Yeah, we're not going to judge about the drool.
[06:06.780 --> 06:08.860]  And you may be wondering, what does Jack like?
[06:11.160 --> 06:11.880]  Jack likes...
[06:12.700 --> 06:13.420]  90's decor!
[06:13.820 --> 06:15.360]  You can see a lot of Godzilla in there.
[06:15.440 --> 06:16.980]  It was probably around the time that came out.
[06:17.340 --> 06:19.220]  Jack also really likes hockey.
[06:19.620 --> 06:20.540]  He's a big hockey guy.
[06:20.600 --> 06:22.080]  It's in his room, he's got Gretzky there.
[06:22.640 --> 06:24.880]  He also enjoys coffee.
[06:24.880 --> 06:30.660]  You see Jack's mug, and his best friend, well, not his best friend, but his co-worker, Dr. Kendall.
[06:31.000 --> 06:37.080]  Jack also really is a big air-drying guy, like Geoff.
[06:37.200 --> 06:38.160]  You two have a lot in common.
[06:38.680 --> 06:40.060]  He loves to air-dry.
[06:40.560 --> 06:42.080]  He's super into it.
[06:43.260 --> 06:44.960]  Jack loves being...
[06:44.960 --> 06:46.920]  Oh, I forgot, this is a whole slide, my apologies.
[06:47.200 --> 06:48.320]  Other notable actors!
[06:49.660 --> 06:50.660]  Dave Thomas!
[06:50.660 --> 06:54.900]  You may be thinking, wow, from Wendy's?
[06:55.320 --> 06:57.020]  Nah, different Dave Thomas.
[06:57.240 --> 06:58.780]  Not related in any way.
[06:59.160 --> 07:00.340]  Next slide!
[07:00.660 --> 07:02.200]  He didn't even show a picture of him.
[07:02.680 --> 07:04.160]  Jack loves college!
[07:04.860 --> 07:09.520]  So he's there, it's like they study him, they do research, he's a big fan of college.
[07:09.860 --> 07:12.440]  Mainly because his best friend Darren's there.
[07:12.560 --> 07:14.660]  He loves Darren. Darren is a janitor at the school.
[07:15.140 --> 07:16.880]  They're best buds, they hang out.
[07:16.880 --> 07:20.620]  And that's his coworker, Dr. Kendall, who you previously saw a mug for.
[07:20.800 --> 07:21.320]  The mug guy!
[07:21.740 --> 07:28.520]  Yeah, he's like a researcher who does this study with Jack, showing how intelligent he is.
[07:28.600 --> 07:30.260]  And they do it in front of kids, this whole thing.
[07:30.560 --> 07:33.360]  We should make Dr. Kendall mugs, we can do that.
[07:34.660 --> 07:38.020]  Jack's also super into rollerblading, loves to help Darren clean up the school.
[07:38.140 --> 07:41.700]  They ride around, and they do classes, the kids love them.
[07:41.800 --> 07:42.980]  They do all sorts of things.
[07:44.900 --> 07:48.480]  But here's Dr. Kendall at home, so they have their big class.
[07:49.080 --> 07:52.720]  And then Dr. Kendall's at home, because this is Jack's final year at the school.
[07:52.840 --> 07:57.320]  He's going to arrange to send Jack back to his reserve, which is I believe called El Simeon.
[07:57.700 --> 07:59.560]  And he's reminiscing about the past.
[07:59.860 --> 08:02.340]  But then tragedy! Tragedy strikes!
[08:03.240 --> 08:05.420]  Dr. Kendall spills his milk.
[08:05.700 --> 08:09.440]  It falls, it hits the floor, it's tragic.
[08:09.940 --> 08:12.120]  Also, he is dead!
[08:12.120 --> 08:14.240]  Dr. Kendall has died.
[08:14.760 --> 08:16.500]  He's no longer with us.
[08:17.680 --> 08:19.380]  We'll have to make an in-memoriam mug.
[08:20.680 --> 08:24.340]  And the saddest part of all of this, nobody told Jack!
[08:24.520 --> 08:27.840]  He showed up to work, he's like, where's Dr. Kendall?
[08:28.280 --> 08:31.800]  He's really sad, because Dr. Kendall is now dead.
[08:32.640 --> 08:36.660]  Oh no, bad guys! The bad guys showed up, that's the head of the school.
[08:36.800 --> 08:39.800]  He's a bad guy, he has a British accent, you don't really learn all that much about him.
[08:39.840 --> 08:41.440]  He's got a white suit, you can tell he's a bad guy.
[08:41.440 --> 08:43.720]  They're there to take Jack away.
[08:43.900 --> 08:46.500]  They're like, what are we gonna do with Jack now that he's gone?
[08:46.620 --> 08:50.600]  And he's like, I'm gonna sell Jack to a hepatitis research facility.
[08:50.860 --> 08:52.420]  And they'll test on Jack.
[08:53.560 --> 08:55.800]  But Darren's here to save the day!
[08:56.140 --> 08:59.380]  Oh shit, I clicked too quick, that was a double click.
[08:59.840 --> 09:05.620]  The janitor, like fucking Sam Fisher, sneaks by, holds the wall, listens in,
[09:05.720 --> 09:07.860]  and he's like, we're gonna sell him to hepatitis.
[09:07.860 --> 09:12.100]  And then that's his face when he's like, oh no, hepatitis is bad, Jack.
[09:12.300 --> 09:14.980]  We might believe the guy in the white suit can't see that mop.
[09:16.520 --> 09:17.580]  Yeah, you are.
[09:18.820 --> 09:22.480]  So then Darren is like, we gotta get you the fuck out of here, Jack.
[09:22.540 --> 09:26.020]  So he throws Jack in a big bag and they go to the train station.
[09:26.300 --> 09:30.480]  And he's like, shh, be quiet Jack, I'm putting you on this train back to your home.
[09:30.780 --> 09:34.940]  So then he throws Jack on the train, and Jack pokes his head out just to see what's up.
[09:34.940 --> 09:39.940]  Because he's heading back to the El Simeon Reserve, which is right there, you see that?
[09:40.020 --> 09:43.640]  El Simeon, that's where he's from, that's where his family is, that's where he's trying to go to.
[09:44.220 --> 09:46.680]  Go here, Jack! El Simeon!
[09:49.920 --> 09:57.560]  Meanwhile, in Nelson, Canada, we are introduced to Stephen and his sister, Tara.
[09:57.980 --> 10:01.880]  Stephen is a big hockey guy, he's from California, they just moved to Nelson.
[10:01.880 --> 10:06.840]  They've got a team in Nelson, Canada, called the Nuggets!
[10:07.440 --> 10:10.560]  Which, uh, Blue from Old School is their biggest fan, he loves them.
[10:10.660 --> 10:13.420]  He's a big Nuggets guy, loves the team.
[10:14.120 --> 10:22.700]  Stephen, being this hot import from California, you mix the Nuggets and the potential of Stephen as an elite hockey player,
[10:23.080 --> 10:25.020]  and you get... eggs!
[10:25.120 --> 10:26.920]  Because they suck, they're the worst team in the league.
[10:27.080 --> 10:31.460]  They get thrown eggs at, everything's bad, they're a terrible team, they're just awful.
[10:31.460 --> 10:32.840]  In every way, so they suck.
[10:33.520 --> 10:34.740]  But Stephen's on the Nuggets.
[10:35.580 --> 10:38.360]  But uh-oh! There's another issue!
[10:39.720 --> 10:41.420]  That's not your stop, Jack!
[10:41.520 --> 10:45.120]  He slept through the train, he missed his stop, he's now in Nelson, Canada,
[10:45.300 --> 10:48.140]  and he's walking around, he's just trying to figure things out a little bit.
[10:49.180 --> 10:54.060]  He moves through, he doesn't know where to go, but that treehouse sure looks cozy!
[10:54.540 --> 10:56.440]  Why didn't Darren go with him?
[10:57.040 --> 11:01.200]  Because he has to continue working, he has a real job, he works at the school.
[11:01.880 --> 11:05.920]  He just didn't want Jack to be sold and potentially killed in a research project.
[11:06.320 --> 11:09.660]  But the treehouse looks cozy, he climbs up it, he makes his home.
[11:10.300 --> 11:13.320]  He's just living his life, he's cozy, everything is great.
[11:13.660 --> 11:17.900]  And maybe the best thing about Nelson, is that the kids have bananas!
[11:18.340 --> 11:21.540]  It's a great place to live, Jack is really enjoying the new environment.
[11:21.540 --> 11:25.440]  So he reaches, he grabs the banana, that's Tara's banana,
[11:25.580 --> 11:28.160]  while they're watching Stephen play hockey.
[11:28.780 --> 11:31.420]  And, you know, first meetings are often tricky.
[11:31.600 --> 11:34.980]  So she notices the banana move, she's like, what's going on with this banana?
[11:35.720 --> 11:39.720]  Jack's like, hey, what's up, my name's Jack, I like hockey and 90s decor.
[11:40.460 --> 11:45.000]  And she does not take this well, she is very alarmed by seeing this.
[11:45.260 --> 11:49.080]  And Jack knows to get the fuck out, he just runs, he books it, he goes back into the woods.
[11:49.080 --> 11:51.560]  He heads back to the treehouse.
[11:51.860 --> 11:55.580]  I like that we can see the previous screenshot in that new screenshot.
[11:55.580 --> 11:58.800]  Yeah, sometimes that happens, you get a little two for one.
[11:59.020 --> 12:00.420]  Two for the price of one, in some of these.
[12:00.880 --> 12:02.320]  You're taking them too quickly.
[12:02.920 --> 12:05.800]  Well, you know, this movie moves quickly, Gavin.
[12:05.900 --> 12:07.940]  You gotta keep up with it or else you get held back.
[12:08.640 --> 12:13.600]  First meetings are tricky, but often they are worth it because they become friends.
[12:13.680 --> 12:17.300]  She follows them to the treehouse, they're now buds.
[12:19.100 --> 12:21.560]  Jack is a hockey guy, as previously established.
[12:21.880 --> 12:22.820]  He loves hockey.
[12:23.400 --> 12:27.100]  So when they get him on the ice, they're like, whoa, look at you, you're doing hockey stuff.
[12:27.180 --> 12:30.300]  He's skating around, he's playing in the net, he slapshots the puck.
[12:30.480 --> 12:32.600]  He hits it so hard, it goes through the net.
[12:32.980 --> 12:34.200]  That's how good his slapshot is.
[12:34.760 --> 12:35.680]  Going through the net.
[12:36.260 --> 12:38.940]  So then he's like, you know what, I wanna play for the team.
[12:39.060 --> 12:44.120]  So he walks into the facility, throws some gear on, hops over the boards into the ice,
[12:44.120 --> 12:47.060]  grabs the puck, scores a goal, gets out, leaves.
[12:47.520 --> 12:48.560]  Shows up, scores, leaves.
[12:48.640 --> 12:50.540]  Everyone's like, what's going on there? That's fucking crazy.
[12:50.860 --> 12:52.120]  They realize it was a chimp.
[12:52.600 --> 12:55.000]  They're all like, what the hell is that monkey doing on the ice?
[12:55.360 --> 12:56.360]  They're all, they're freaking out.
[12:56.920 --> 13:00.660]  So then all the owners have a meeting because they profit share.
[13:00.740 --> 13:02.740]  This is a real scene at a point in the movie.
[13:03.020 --> 13:07.580]  The owners get together, they're like, should we allow this monkey to play in our league?
[13:07.940 --> 13:12.000]  They all profit share, they're like, oh, people will pay money to see this monkey play hockey.
[13:12.420 --> 13:13.040]  Let's do it.
[13:13.040 --> 13:13.660]  So that's them.
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.180]  They're all agreeing that he could be in the league.
[13:16.300 --> 13:17.560]  He's now a legal player.
[13:18.140 --> 13:19.260]  Everything is above board.
[13:19.840 --> 13:21.100]  Welcome to the team, Jack.
[13:21.620 --> 13:24.040]  Hey, can I just, one quick intersection?
[13:24.400 --> 13:24.720]  Of course.
[13:24.920 --> 13:26.440]  We could do that while shit's up on the stage.
[13:27.740 --> 13:31.620]  Because the audience has already pointed out a few times, and I imagine they're going to point it out over and over again.
[13:31.740 --> 13:33.900]  We know that a chimpanzee is not a monkey.
[13:34.220 --> 13:35.540]  It's, I get it.
[13:35.960 --> 13:39.080]  They're not the same thing, but monkey's just a fun word to say.
[13:39.220 --> 13:39.980]  Okay, sorry, go ahead.
[13:41.040 --> 13:46.440]  Now with Jack joining the Nuggets, the Nuggets go from shit to hit.
[13:46.660 --> 13:46.900]  Hit.
[13:47.040 --> 13:47.360]  Immediately.
[13:47.820 --> 13:48.700]  They're going up.
[13:48.920 --> 13:49.820]  They're scoring goals.
[13:50.120 --> 13:51.200]  Jack's hitting people with sticks.
[13:51.360 --> 13:52.240]  They're on papers.
[13:52.360 --> 13:53.040]  He thumbs up.
[13:53.140 --> 13:53.960]  Oh, everything's great.
[13:54.100 --> 13:58.840]  They're going to the Harvest Cup, which is like the highest achievement you get.
[13:58.900 --> 14:02.980]  It's like their Super Bowl, essentially, for their league, or Stanley Cup, if we're within hockey.
[14:03.760 --> 14:06.300]  But what happened to those bad guys?
[14:07.940 --> 14:09.340]  He's all like calling around.
[14:09.440 --> 14:11.060]  People are like, hey, where's Jack?
[14:11.120 --> 14:11.960]  What's going on with Jack?
[14:12.020 --> 14:14.220]  We're going to remove our funding if you can't find Jack.
[14:14.520 --> 14:16.600]  So he's calling, going like, where's my monkey?
[14:16.820 --> 14:18.700]  And he's eating, he's eating stuff.
[14:18.840 --> 14:25.220]  And then he looks at the TV and he sees highlights of Jack playing hockey, saying that he's going to be in this tournament.
[14:25.680 --> 14:26.860]  So he's like, oh, there he is.
[14:26.920 --> 14:27.500]  There's my monkey.
[14:27.540 --> 14:28.460]  I'm going to go get him.
[14:29.020 --> 14:34.300]  So he travels to Vancouver, BC, which is where the championship is for the Harvest Cup.
[14:34.300 --> 14:35.980]  Is it all because he doesn't like hepatitis?
[14:37.400 --> 14:39.420]  No, there's no reason.
[14:39.500 --> 14:40.240]  He just wanted money.
[14:40.360 --> 14:42.540]  They're going to pay him money to send him to this facility.
[14:43.100 --> 14:44.680]  So he's walking around the arena.
[14:45.300 --> 14:49.320]  Tara walks into him, spills her hot chocolate all over his pants.
[14:49.940 --> 14:54.600]  And then him and his sidekick are like, hey, have you seen my monkey with a wanted poster?
[14:55.360 --> 14:57.600]  And Tara like runs away in fear.
[14:57.920 --> 15:02.620]  And so he chases after her and goes to the team's room and is like, give me the monkey now.
[15:02.620 --> 15:03.340]  And he points at him.
[15:03.420 --> 15:04.060]  They close the door.
[15:04.960 --> 15:08.160]  I think this guy was dressed as a pirate once in Keenan and Kel.
[15:10.460 --> 15:11.520]  I'd love to check that.
[15:12.220 --> 15:16.120]  So quick, they have to make a plan because they're there to steal Jack.
[15:16.240 --> 15:16.980]  So they're going through.
[15:17.140 --> 15:18.880]  They look at the back of Jack's photo.
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.060]  They see the name El Simi Nature Preserve.
[15:21.140 --> 15:22.240]  They're like, this must be it.
[15:22.320 --> 15:23.140]  This must be his home.
[15:23.260 --> 15:29.760]  So they call the preserve and then Tara gets in a cab and she's going to go help figure things out.
[15:29.840 --> 15:30.720]  She's leaving the arena.
[15:31.200 --> 15:32.100]  They're go, go now.
[15:32.100 --> 15:35.800]  She's go, go now-ing to get assistance for the future.
[15:37.180 --> 15:40.420]  After all that happens, we go back to the game because it's important.
[15:40.560 --> 15:41.600]  It's the championship match.
[15:42.200 --> 15:42.760]  It's 1-1.
[15:43.360 --> 15:45.040]  Two minutes, 32 seconds on the clock.
[15:45.240 --> 15:46.040]  Third period.
[15:46.220 --> 15:47.100]  It's down to the wire.
[15:47.740 --> 15:50.220]  The Nuggets take a shot and it stops on the line.
[15:50.660 --> 15:51.660]  I need a drink of water in my throat.
[15:52.660 --> 15:53.720]  And that's not a goal.
[15:54.540 --> 15:55.500]  That's not a goal.
[15:55.980 --> 15:56.900]  It hasn't crossed.
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.600]  It stopped directly on the line.
[16:00.260 --> 16:01.580]  So it's a big scramble.
[16:01.580 --> 16:03.600]  The goalie gets all caught up.
[16:03.680 --> 16:04.580]  The goalie's being held down.
[16:04.680 --> 16:05.040]  They're fighting.
[16:05.560 --> 16:06.420]  All the players are fighting.
[16:06.660 --> 16:08.940]  But Jack, he slides for it.
[16:09.540 --> 16:11.440]  He goes right between the legs of the guy.
[16:11.600 --> 16:12.420]  Oh, he's begged him.
[16:12.720 --> 16:13.900]  And he scores!
[16:14.180 --> 16:15.020]  The Nuggets win.
[16:15.080 --> 16:16.240]  The Nuggets win the championship.
[16:16.420 --> 16:17.120]  They're all celebrating.
[16:17.260 --> 16:18.080]  Everyone's all happy.
[16:18.500 --> 16:19.560]  It's a huge success.
[16:20.200 --> 16:21.040]  But wait!
[16:21.300 --> 16:23.060]  It was Tara all along!
[16:23.380 --> 16:23.540]  What?
[16:23.540 --> 16:24.740]  She's the one who scored.
[16:24.940 --> 16:26.300]  She slid in.
[16:26.720 --> 16:28.740]  And they're like, it was Tara?
[16:29.560 --> 16:30.520]  Where's Jack?
[16:30.520 --> 16:31.520]  What happened?
[16:31.640 --> 16:32.120]  Doesn't matter.
[16:32.320 --> 16:32.640]  Party time.
[16:32.760 --> 16:33.260]  We're celebrating.
[16:33.580 --> 16:34.440]  We're celebrating the win.
[16:34.520 --> 16:35.060]  It's a big win.
[16:35.340 --> 16:36.100]  Bad guys lost.
[16:36.260 --> 16:37.520]  But where's Jack?
[16:39.720 --> 16:40.760]  Jack's on a journey.
[16:41.100 --> 16:43.000]  He was the one who got in the cab.
[16:43.360 --> 16:47.840]  They took him to the airport and bought him a ticket to go back to the El Simeon Preserve.
[16:48.280 --> 16:49.260]  So he's riding in.
[16:49.400 --> 16:50.160]  He goes home.
[16:50.220 --> 16:51.000]  He gets driven there.
[16:51.160 --> 16:52.040]  He sees his family.
[16:52.260 --> 16:54.320]  His best friend Darren now works there.
[16:54.840 --> 16:55.660]  Everything's great.
[16:55.960 --> 16:57.000]  He gives him a hug.
[16:57.560 --> 16:58.520]  It's just happy.
[16:58.600 --> 16:59.500]  Everything's all around happy.
[16:59.500 --> 17:00.600]  They win the championship.
[17:00.880 --> 17:01.500]  Everyone's great.
[17:01.620 --> 17:02.260]  He goes home.
[17:02.400 --> 17:03.060]  Darren's there.
[17:03.260 --> 17:04.700]  It is the end of the film.
[17:05.420 --> 17:05.980]  Banana wipe!
[17:06.440 --> 17:06.880]  The end.
[17:07.160 --> 17:08.000]  Oh, you did it!
[17:08.120 --> 17:08.980]  Oh, you did it!
[17:09.440 --> 17:10.200]  That was excellent!
[17:10.800 --> 17:11.380]  But wait!
[17:13.000 --> 17:13.900]  There's more!
[17:15.380 --> 17:16.640]  Where are they now?
[17:17.280 --> 17:21.720]  So I was curious about Jack and who played him in the role.
[17:22.160 --> 17:24.680]  Jack was played by three different chimps.
[17:25.060 --> 17:26.140]  Louie, Bernie, and Mac.
[17:26.780 --> 17:27.160]  Yes.
[17:27.160 --> 17:30.380]  One of them, Bernie, you can see there.
[17:30.980 --> 17:34.720]  Bernie played him, I think, the most for MVP and I believe also in MVP 2.
[17:35.880 --> 17:37.500]  Bernie is now in the Oakland Zoo!
[17:38.280 --> 17:38.620]  Oh!
[17:39.120 --> 17:39.980]  Did he get put on a train?
[17:40.440 --> 17:41.620]  Yeah, he flew.
[17:42.560 --> 17:43.660]  That's where he really went.
[17:44.360 --> 17:45.060]  He went there.
[17:45.160 --> 17:48.280]  I read in 2010 was the last update I was able to find of Bernie.
[17:48.460 --> 17:53.620]  So I emailed the Oakland Zoo to confirm he was still a resident there.
[17:54.260 --> 18:00.080]  They replied saying yes he was and then sent me a bunch of information about how using animals in films is wrong.
[18:00.560 --> 18:01.740]  So I did not follow up.
[18:02.900 --> 18:03.560]  Banana wipe!
[18:04.620 --> 18:05.100]  The end.
[18:05.180 --> 18:05.920]  What about the other two?
[18:06.080 --> 18:07.240]  The other two chimps?
[18:07.400 --> 18:08.460]  I have no idea where they went.
[18:08.620 --> 18:08.900]  Okay.
[18:09.300 --> 18:12.120]  What was the bad guy's name in the suit?
[18:12.760 --> 18:13.620]  Oh, God.
[18:13.760 --> 18:15.120]  Is it Peabody, maybe?
[18:15.660 --> 18:16.340]  I don't remember.
[18:16.420 --> 18:19.660]  He's such an insignificant character in the movie.
[18:19.660 --> 18:23.840]  I was trying to look up the cast to see if he did, in fact, appear in...
[18:24.500 --> 18:25.600]  Oh, is that right?
[18:26.000 --> 18:26.480]  Was I right?
[18:26.720 --> 18:27.260]  I don't know.
[18:27.860 --> 18:30.400]  I think he worked at a jewelry shop in Friends, too.
[18:30.780 --> 18:32.100]  Is his name Dr. Peabody?
[18:32.320 --> 18:33.020]  Maybe that's it.
[18:33.180 --> 18:35.080]  I think it is Peabody.
[18:35.200 --> 18:35.960]  Okay, let's see.
[18:36.100 --> 18:37.420]  He appeared in...
[18:37.420 --> 18:38.140]  Oh, my God.
[18:38.180 --> 18:39.600]  He's been in 115 things.
[18:40.400 --> 18:41.260]  He's been in a lot of stuff.
[18:41.780 --> 18:45.720]  I've seen him as just a miffed Brit in pretty much every American thing he's in.
[18:46.000 --> 18:47.300]  You said Keenan and Kel, right?
[18:47.680 --> 18:48.000]  Yeah.
[18:48.780 --> 18:50.520]  He's not showing up for that.
[18:50.800 --> 18:51.520]  Oh, shit.
[18:52.240 --> 18:52.560]  Could be wrong.
[18:52.820 --> 18:53.660]  What's that show called?
[18:53.920 --> 18:54.140]  Kel?
[18:54.380 --> 18:54.880]  Keenan and Kel?
[18:55.040 --> 18:55.340]  No, no.
[18:55.700 --> 18:57.040]  He played Gavin the waiter.
[18:57.200 --> 19:01.460]  He played Gavin the waiter in 1999 in Keenan and Kel.
[19:02.200 --> 19:04.920]  Yeah, I think he was dressed as a pirate with a parrot on him.
[19:05.160 --> 19:07.200]  He was the British colonel in The Spy Who Shagged Me.
[19:08.140 --> 19:08.420]  Really?
[19:08.600 --> 19:10.720]  Oh, that's where I recognize him from.
[19:10.960 --> 19:12.700]  Yeah, I could see that now.
[19:13.880 --> 19:15.800]  Oh, he's in MVP, too, as well.
[19:16.620 --> 19:16.960]  He is?
[19:16.960 --> 19:17.220]  Spoiler.
[19:17.880 --> 19:19.360]  He plays a different character.
[19:19.940 --> 19:25.500]  He's Dr. Peabody in Most Valuable Primate and MVP2 Most Vertical Primate, which I do not know what it's called.
[19:27.280 --> 19:29.020]  His name is Mr. Rahasia.
[19:30.360 --> 19:30.780]  Interesting.
[19:31.200 --> 19:32.340]  We'll have to keep our eye open for him.
[19:32.860 --> 19:35.160]  Anyway, I didn't mean to get a sidetracked.
[19:35.660 --> 19:38.820]  Andrew, that was a phenomenal recitation.
[19:39.120 --> 19:42.940]  I feel completely and totally versed in the MVP universe now.
[19:43.520 --> 19:46.560]  And I don't know about you, Gavin, but I was hanging on your every word.
[19:46.560 --> 19:47.360]  I loved it.
[19:47.520 --> 19:48.040]  That was great.
[19:48.160 --> 19:50.240]  And the surprise banana wipe at the end.
[19:50.660 --> 19:50.940]  Yeah.
[19:51.880 --> 19:54.100]  I got a lot of help in putting that together.
[19:54.400 --> 19:57.600]  If it was just me, it would have definitely been more salad creamed.
[19:57.800 --> 19:58.980]  I'm glad that you guys enjoyed it.
[19:59.280 --> 20:00.660]  I'm excited to watch this movie.
[20:01.760 --> 20:02.560]  I... yeah.
[20:04.060 --> 20:05.560]  I don't know if this will be terrible.
[20:06.240 --> 20:07.540]  I don't know if this will be fun.
[20:07.940 --> 20:09.100]  I'm hoping it will be fun.
[20:09.420 --> 20:10.960]  I know it starts out great.
[20:11.240 --> 20:12.540]  It has a fantastic opening.
[20:12.660 --> 20:14.760]  It's the only thing I've revisited in recent time.
[20:14.760 --> 20:16.200]  Should we start?
[20:16.860 --> 20:17.420]  We probably should.
[20:17.500 --> 20:18.900]  This guy is like my new favorite actor.
[20:19.200 --> 20:20.200]  His roles, man.
[20:21.040 --> 20:21.600]  He...
[20:21.600 --> 20:23.840]  I've posted in the text chat.
[20:24.440 --> 20:25.200]  Was that Darren?
[20:26.320 --> 20:27.340]  Or Peabody?
[20:27.800 --> 20:28.780]  Oh, there he is.
[20:30.300 --> 20:31.400]  Mr. Peabody.
[20:32.000 --> 20:33.620]  Or Dr. Peabody.
[20:34.020 --> 20:34.580]  That's fantastic.
[20:34.820 --> 20:35.500]  Oh, that's awesome.
[20:38.300 --> 20:39.960]  Oh, all right.
[20:40.040 --> 20:46.380]  Well, I think that covers MVP 1 Most Vertical Primate from 2000 in its entirety.
[20:46.700 --> 20:51.100]  If you needed a primer before you watch MVP 2, you've got it right there.
[20:51.440 --> 20:52.420]  Thanks for listening to this.
[20:52.520 --> 20:53.720]  Now, go ahead and stop.
[20:53.780 --> 20:59.380]  And then if you're brave, hop on into MVP 2 with us, Most Vertical Primate.
[20:59.920 --> 21:02.180]  What service is it on so people can watch along?
[21:02.520 --> 21:03.260]  Amazon Prime.
[21:03.500 --> 21:03.840]  Amazon.
[21:03.840 --> 21:05.580]  You can get it on Amazon and Tubi.
[21:06.060 --> 21:07.860]  I was about to say, I have no idea.
[21:08.120 --> 21:09.000]  It sounds like Amazon Prime.
[21:09.160 --> 21:09.900]  Okay, there you go.
[21:20.520 --> 21:23.840]  I mean, you just share a screen through Discord.
[21:24.280 --> 21:26.860]  Yeah, I clicked the button and it took me here.
[21:27.260 --> 21:30.040]  You clicked the Discord button for sharing screens?
[21:30.200 --> 21:33.420]  I clicked the Discord button for sharing screen and it took me here.
[21:35.700 --> 21:36.800]  I don't know why you're mad at me.
[21:36.980 --> 21:37.760]  I don't know why.
[21:37.940 --> 21:39.340]  I'm getting yelled at for yawning.
[21:39.580 --> 21:40.880]  All I did was yawn.
[21:40.940 --> 21:42.040]  I'm getting attacked for that.
[21:42.640 --> 21:43.820]  I'm clicking buttons.
[21:43.940 --> 21:45.480]  I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do.
[21:45.640 --> 21:49.080]  You think the thing that absolves you here is that you're clicking buttons?
[21:49.220 --> 21:50.600]  You think that's what I want to hear?
[21:51.520 --> 21:53.320]  Yeah, because you wanted me to share my screen.
[21:54.380 --> 21:55.880]  Gavin just shared his screen.
[21:56.080 --> 21:56.860]  It was very easy.
[21:57.160 --> 21:59.040]  Congratulations, you're on a different computer.
[21:59.040 --> 21:59.860]  I mean, it's so simple.
[21:59.860 --> 22:02.280]  We're able to do a thing that I couldn't do on my computer.
[22:02.940 --> 22:03.580]  It's 100% simple.
[22:03.580 --> 22:05.140]  No, I got a security pop-up.
[22:05.660 --> 22:08.200]  I mean, it's dead simple to share your screen.
[22:09.440 --> 22:13.140]  You can choose to quit Google Chrome app now or do it on your own later.
[22:15.360 --> 22:18.200]  Do you not have Discord? You have the app?
[22:18.920 --> 22:19.720]  Like a browser app?
[22:19.740 --> 22:20.460]  I'm just on their browser.
[22:20.940 --> 22:21.860]  Yeah, I just go on the browser.
[22:21.980 --> 22:22.200]  What?
[22:22.360 --> 22:22.800]  I just Google it.
[22:23.900 --> 22:24.640]  I don't use the app.
[22:24.640 --> 22:25.120]  We're fucked.
[22:25.720 --> 22:26.280]  This isn't like...
[22:26.900 --> 22:28.720]  So we're doing Discord through a browser.
[22:29.140 --> 22:29.500]  Why?
[22:30.040 --> 22:30.800]  The entire time.
[22:30.860 --> 22:31.220]  Why?
[22:31.420 --> 22:33.700]  Why would I do it any other way?
[22:33.720 --> 22:34.540]  It's a program.
[22:34.860 --> 22:35.800]  Look, I'm sharing my screen.
[22:35.800 --> 22:36.300]  Yeah.
[22:36.880 --> 22:38.580]  Geoff, did it take you...
[22:38.580 --> 22:44.760]  Like, when you were doing that, did it take you to a Google Chrome page where you just started clicking buttons?
[22:45.040 --> 22:46.800]  No, it didn't do any of those things.
[22:47.160 --> 22:47.820]  Okay, wait.
[22:47.880 --> 22:48.500]  No, wait a second.
[22:48.620 --> 22:49.460]  I think it's okay now.
[22:50.600 --> 22:52.220]  I think we can record the screen now.
[22:52.860 --> 22:53.660]  Share your screen.
[22:53.720 --> 22:54.740]  This is so good already.
[22:55.960 --> 22:56.840]  Entire screen.
[22:58.080 --> 22:59.320]  Who's Jerry Lee Lewis?
[22:59.860 --> 23:01.320]  What do you mean, who's Jerry Lee Lewis?
[23:02.140 --> 23:03.060]  He's not American.
[23:03.320 --> 23:04.200]  Gavin's not American.
[23:04.700 --> 23:04.920]  Oh.
[23:04.920 --> 23:05.560]  Yeah.
[23:05.920 --> 23:07.340]  I mean, consider that.
[23:07.960 --> 23:09.620]  Well, he's dead.
[23:10.300 --> 23:12.080]  He's famous for marrying his...
[23:12.080 --> 23:12.420]  Oh, really?
[23:12.760 --> 23:13.200]  No, Jerry...
[23:13.980 --> 23:15.900]  No, Jerry Lewis is not dead.
[23:16.500 --> 23:18.720]  Are you talking about Jerry Lee Lewis or Jerry Lee Lewis?
[23:18.880 --> 23:20.260]  Jerry Lee Lewis is not dead.
[23:20.940 --> 23:21.260]  Oh.
[23:21.680 --> 23:23.700]  A bunch of reports came out saying he died.
[23:24.080 --> 23:24.800]  He is not dead.
[23:25.200 --> 23:27.620]  He's famous for marrying his 14-year-old cousin.
[23:27.820 --> 23:30.080]  He's not famous for marrying his cousin.
[23:30.220 --> 23:32.300]  He is famous and he married his cousin.
[23:32.580 --> 23:33.460]  But not dead?
[23:33.920 --> 23:34.820]  No, he's not dead.
[23:35.100 --> 23:36.220]  No, it came out yesterday.
[23:36.320 --> 23:37.620]  A bunch of people reported that he's dead.
[23:37.800 --> 23:39.780]  He's like 88 or 89.
[23:40.080 --> 23:40.360]  He's old.
[23:40.360 --> 23:41.720]  It just popped up on my watch.
[23:42.060 --> 23:42.900]  Dead at 87.
[23:43.980 --> 23:44.160]  No.
[23:44.160 --> 23:44.380]  No, wait.
[23:44.540 --> 23:44.880]  Hang on.
[23:44.940 --> 23:45.200]  Did...
[23:45.200 --> 23:46.000]  No, he didn't act...
[23:46.000 --> 23:46.940]  He actually died?
[23:47.780 --> 23:48.640]  Jerry Lee Lewis died?
[23:48.980 --> 23:50.000]  Did he just die?
[23:50.220 --> 23:51.320]  I mean, it just popped up on my watch saying...
[23:51.320 --> 23:52.100]  I just tweeted about it yesterday.
[23:52.480 --> 23:54.440]  I mean, one day ago.
[23:54.760 --> 23:55.600]  Entertainment Weekly.
[23:55.720 --> 23:56.460]  One day ago.
[23:56.820 --> 24:00.560]  Jerry Lee Lewis is alive after being erroneously reported dead at 87.
[24:00.880 --> 24:01.420]  Is he dead?
[24:01.420 --> 24:03.460]  It's probably annoying to die the next day after that.
[24:03.560 --> 24:04.420]  He cannot be.
[24:04.500 --> 24:05.420]  It's not on CNN.
[24:06.220 --> 24:07.680]  That happened with the Queen, right?
[24:07.760 --> 24:10.200]  There are fake reports that they were like, oh, she's dead.
[24:10.240 --> 24:11.240]  And they're like, no, she's not dead.
[24:11.260 --> 24:11.720]  She's fine.
[24:11.800 --> 24:13.460]  Wikipedia says he's alive.
[24:13.640 --> 24:14.960]  No, Wikipedia says he's dead.
[24:15.280 --> 24:17.300]  And TMZ is reporting now that Jerry Lee Lewis is dead at 87.
[24:17.340 --> 24:18.020]  No, he's dead.
[24:18.140 --> 24:18.360]  He's dead.
[24:18.940 --> 24:19.860]  What are the chances?
[24:20.760 --> 24:22.260]  We weren't even going to give him socks.
[24:22.440 --> 24:23.000]  I mean, hi.
[24:23.120 --> 24:23.500]  He's 88.
[24:23.620 --> 24:24.860]  Gavin, do you remember...
[24:24.860 --> 24:27.420]  Have you ever heard that song, Goodness, Gracious, Great Balls of Fire?
[24:27.540 --> 24:27.880]  Oh, yeah.
[24:27.920 --> 24:28.300]  I've heard that.
[24:28.480 --> 24:29.320]  That's Jerry Lee Lewis.
[24:29.900 --> 24:31.820]  I tweeted that yesterday.
[24:32.040 --> 24:32.680]  Oh, you did?
[24:32.680 --> 24:33.120]  After the thing.
[24:33.480 --> 24:34.800]  Just because I thought it was funny.
[24:35.020 --> 24:35.180]  Yeah.
[24:35.280 --> 24:35.580]  You tweeted.
[24:35.760 --> 24:36.740]  People wouldn't have context.
[24:37.120 --> 24:39.600]  All I did was tweet Great Balls of Fire, the video for it.
[24:39.680 --> 24:40.780]  Because he was reported dead?
[24:41.160 --> 24:42.280]  No, because he put icy hot.
[24:42.280 --> 24:43.360]  No, because my balls were on fire.
[24:43.620 --> 24:43.800]  Oh.
[24:44.780 --> 24:45.440]  And then you...
[24:45.440 --> 24:46.180]  So you killed him.
[24:47.180 --> 24:47.600]  I guess.
[24:47.760 --> 24:48.440]  You killed Jerry...
[24:48.440 --> 24:49.400]  I didn't have anything to do with that.
[24:49.800 --> 24:50.640]  Holy shit!
[24:51.340 --> 24:51.740]  We...
[24:51.740 --> 24:53.540]  Andrew killed Jerry Lee Lewis.
[24:54.300 --> 24:55.460]  Oh, Andrew's live.
[24:56.020 --> 24:56.360]  Okay, so...
[24:56.360 --> 24:57.320]  I've been live the whole time.
[24:58.260 --> 25:00.380]  Geoff, go ahead and intro it.
[25:00.600 --> 25:01.220]  And then we'll go from there.
[25:01.220 --> 25:01.420]  Okay, you ready?
[25:01.840 --> 25:02.460]  Am I recording?
[25:02.880 --> 25:06.200]  Your doc is a nightmare.
[25:06.980 --> 25:07.880]  I just wanted to make sure.
[25:08.380 --> 25:08.720]  All right.
[25:08.880 --> 25:09.740]  Is it now...
[25:09.740 --> 25:11.820]  I'm going to wait for Andrew to say he's recording and good.
[25:11.840 --> 25:12.420]  I'm recording.
[25:12.600 --> 25:13.040]  Yeah, I'm good.
[25:13.260 --> 25:14.000]  Seven minutes in.
[25:14.860 --> 25:17.140]  Are you streaming to us at the highest quality?
[25:17.780 --> 25:18.600]  I don't know what that means.
[25:18.660 --> 25:19.460]  How would I check that?
[25:19.920 --> 25:20.100]  Oh.
[25:20.240 --> 25:22.260]  Because you get to pick, like, the resolution that you're streaming.
[25:22.260 --> 25:23.000]  Oh, stream settings.
[25:23.700 --> 25:24.060]  Oh.
[25:24.400 --> 25:25.360]  I can change windows.
[25:25.360 --> 25:26.520]  How many bits do you have?
[25:26.520 --> 25:27.880]  Are you going to blow through all your bits?
[25:28.100 --> 25:28.480]  Oh, no.
[25:28.620 --> 25:29.140]  My bits are good.
[25:29.440 --> 25:30.700]  My bits are secure.
[25:31.980 --> 25:32.340]  Uh...
[25:32.340 --> 25:34.160]  I don't know how I would change that setting, Gavin.
[25:34.220 --> 25:34.720]  How does it look?
[25:34.780 --> 25:35.500]  You look for me.
[25:35.980 --> 25:36.820]  Tell me how it looks.
[25:36.820 --> 25:37.660]  It looks a bit blurry.
[25:38.040 --> 25:42.300]  There's one setting that says smoother frame rate and the other one says, like, more readable text.
[25:43.040 --> 25:43.960]  So I want...
[25:45.060 --> 25:45.420]  Like...
[25:45.420 --> 25:46.460]  Yours doesn't have that.
[25:47.000 --> 25:47.360]  No.
[25:47.440 --> 25:47.980]  I hate...
[25:47.980 --> 25:50.680]  It's probably because he's using a browser version.
[25:50.720 --> 25:51.640]  Jesus Christ.
[25:51.760 --> 25:54.860]  Of all of the apps on your doc, of all of those, none of them are Discord.
[25:55.720 --> 25:56.000]  No.
[25:58.660 --> 26:00.620]  Why would I download it when I can just Google it?
[26:04.940 --> 26:06.400]  I don't even know what all these are.
[26:07.140 --> 26:08.100]  I'll tell you what they aren't.
