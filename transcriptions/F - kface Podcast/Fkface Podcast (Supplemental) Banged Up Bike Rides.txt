[00:00.000 --> 00:03.100]  And so Sunday, we finally got to go on a lovely little bike ride together.
[00:03.420 --> 00:08.300]  First off, I have discovered a new joy in life, and that joy is
[00:09.180 --> 00:12.800]  leisurely riding to the top of a hill to sit and turn around and wait
[00:12.800 --> 00:18.580]  and watch while Gavin struggles mightily for hours to make it up that hill.
[00:18.760 --> 00:21.520]  We immediately went up this giant hill and then I got to the top of it
[00:21.520 --> 00:25.100]  and I fucking I thoroughly enjoyed watching Gavin get up there.
[00:25.220 --> 00:28.140]  And then I thought it's going to be a lot more hilly this way.
[00:28.140 --> 00:30.300]  Let's just turn around and go back down and go the other way.
[00:30.300 --> 00:32.480]  And so we just immediately turned around.
[00:32.520 --> 00:36.380]  It was for no reason. And my bike, uh, because it's been...
[00:36.920 --> 00:39.600]  Whenever we last went on a bike ride and we talked about how the brakes
[00:39.600 --> 00:42.520]  are switched and I almost died, that was the last time I rode this bike.
[00:42.620 --> 00:44.280]  So now both the tires are flat.
[00:44.520 --> 00:46.720]  The air just, I guess, there's a hole in one of them.
[00:47.140 --> 00:49.820]  We pumped it up immediately after about two minutes.
[00:50.100 --> 00:51.100]  They were like flaccid.
[00:51.120 --> 00:54.980]  And every time I went over a hump, I could feel it bottoming out against the
[00:55.520 --> 00:56.320]  against the metal.
[00:56.320 --> 00:57.800]  You never mentioned that.
[00:57.920 --> 01:02.640]  So I'm riding up hills with with basically two flat tires
[01:02.640 --> 01:06.000]  while a lazy boy up here is just cruising up them.
[01:06.200 --> 01:09.740]  I realized the disparity in our in our gear really quickly.
[01:10.120 --> 01:14.240]  And so in an effort to be as insulting to Gavin as possible,
[01:14.360 --> 01:16.640]  I went up the whole hill without using my hands.
[01:16.780 --> 01:20.920]  And instead, I interlocked them behind my head and leaned back on the bike
[01:20.920 --> 01:23.040]  as if I was taking a nap in a chair.
[01:23.520 --> 01:25.860]  Then I get, I get scared by this.
[01:26.020 --> 01:27.100]  We were on the road.
[01:27.220 --> 01:28.560]  So there was a car coming up behind us.
[01:28.720 --> 01:32.220]  The first car that got up behind us, I was sort of a little bit scared.
[01:32.420 --> 01:33.720]  It was coming. It was clearly impatient.
[01:33.800 --> 01:34.820]  I thought I'll get out of the way.
[01:35.220 --> 01:39.520]  Geoff just leisurely cruises out into the road, slowing this car down.
[01:39.640 --> 01:43.000]  And I panicked and I just turned off the wrong way, which Geoff found really funny
[01:43.000 --> 01:45.460]  that we were, we ended up in different directions down the street.
[01:45.700 --> 01:47.420]  Then later on, it happened again.
[01:47.620 --> 01:51.720]  And in like a one lane, Geoff, Geoff's like we're running through the middle of the road.
[01:51.720 --> 01:53.940]  And clearly like some cars are piling up behind us.
[01:54.000 --> 01:55.920]  So my thought is, let me get to the side.
[01:56.100 --> 01:58.140]  Geoff doesn't think this at all. He's like, I'll stay in the middle.
[01:58.640 --> 02:01.180]  But then I was so panicked by this car.
[02:01.240 --> 02:03.760]  I put so much pressure on me that the bottom of my pedal
[02:04.240 --> 02:08.180]  twatted the curb and it bounced my bike up.
[02:08.460 --> 02:10.620]  Geoff starts shitting himself with laughter again.
[02:11.020 --> 02:13.680]  And I'm like, you wrecked, you loser.
[02:14.160 --> 02:16.100]  Yeah, I came off. I came off.
[02:16.220 --> 02:17.180]  I had to pull off to the side.
[02:18.040 --> 02:19.760]  I was laughing too. I couldn't see.
[02:20.280 --> 02:22.500]  We were just like laughing all over each other.
[02:22.920 --> 02:24.880]  Geoff makes fun of me for ages about this.
[02:25.020 --> 02:31.020]  And then eight minutes later, Geoff crashes for no reason into a wall.
[02:31.360 --> 02:36.120]  His handlebars, his handlebars hit the wall in front of a load of people, by the way.
[02:37.120 --> 02:39.720]  And I'm talking to him, not looking at him, I'm just to his side.
[02:40.620 --> 02:41.660]  He's telling a story.
[02:41.960 --> 02:47.160]  All I hear all of a sudden is, I look over, Geoff has hit the wall
[02:47.160 --> 02:49.740]  and I guess he like stopped the front of his bike dead.
[02:49.860 --> 02:55.320]  I look over his ass is about two feet above the saddle and he's still holding on.
[02:55.580 --> 02:57.760]  It was the most bizarre freeze frame.
[02:58.260 --> 03:01.620]  And I think a much more embarrassing wreck than the one I did.
[03:01.700 --> 03:05.260]  And it was more embarrassing if only because you were right.
[03:05.320 --> 03:07.100]  There were probably 25 people in front of us.
[03:08.660 --> 03:13.020]  Well, you want to see where that clip's from and all the other clips
[03:13.020 --> 03:16.020]  that you're going to be seeing with the new fuck face regulation animation,
[03:16.020 --> 03:19.020]  subscribe to fuck face, the podcast, check it out.
[03:19.100 --> 03:21.160]  Now get a first membership and get it a day early.
[03:21.540 --> 03:23.540]  It's really all we could ask from you.
[03:23.600 --> 03:25.220]  Also, don't scrum, please.
[03:25.840 --> 03:26.280]  I'm scrumping.
