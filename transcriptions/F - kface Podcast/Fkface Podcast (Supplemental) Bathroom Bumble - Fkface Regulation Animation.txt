[00:00.000 --> 00:03.000]  I think I took maybe the saddest image anyone has ever taken, Gavin.
[00:03.480 --> 00:09.140]  Saturday night. Saturday night, this is gonna be great. I'm gonna relax. I'm gonna have a great
[00:09.140 --> 00:15.900]  time. I bought two cupcakes from my favorite cupcake place in town. Two of them. My favorite
[00:15.900 --> 00:22.320]  flavor. This is gonna be... what a time! What a treat! So I get my cupcakes. I put both of them
[00:22.320 --> 00:26.760]  in a bowl. What I like to do as I put them in a bowl, I mix them all up. I eat them. I eat
[00:26.760 --> 00:32.060]  them with a spoon, like a cake. You are a freak. Yeah, I know, I know. It's delicious.
[00:32.420 --> 00:35.840]  He makes cupcake soup. It's fucking strong. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What's wrong with you?
[00:36.640 --> 00:40.840]  Hear me out, okay? There's a reason for this. I need the bowl. If I'm not doing this,
[00:40.900 --> 00:44.320]  I'm not gonna eat in the bowl. But what I was gonna do is I put it in the bowl,
[00:44.640 --> 00:49.920]  I mix it all up, and then I'm gonna have a bath. And I'm gonna eat the cupcakes in a bath with a
[00:49.920 --> 00:55.640]  spoon. It's gonna be so relaxing. This is my Saturday night. I'm gonna unwind.
[00:55.640 --> 01:01.600]  You can't keep saying... you can't keep saying these insane things and then just
[01:02.120 --> 01:07.080]  keep going like it's normal. What are you on about? What's the problem?
[01:10.340 --> 01:15.220]  Whatever, this is gonna be a great night. So I get them in the bowl. I go to my bathroom.
[01:16.100 --> 01:23.080]  My toilet is level with my bathtub perfectly, to the point where it's like a table. It's perfect.
[01:24.400 --> 01:30.600]  That's incredibly unhygienic. It gets dumber. No, it's not. How is it? That's not the issue,
[01:30.940 --> 01:38.100]  Gavin. The problem, Gavin, is that my toilet is broken. It exploded. The lid is off. It's
[01:38.100 --> 01:44.700]  on the floor in the corner. The seat that you sit on is also loose. I can fix all these things.
[01:45.080 --> 01:49.740]  I need to like re-bolt everything down. I don't feel like doing this. This is a relaxing
[01:50.380 --> 01:54.680]  cupcake time. I also forgot to mention I'm gonna be there for a while, so I'm bringing in a few
[01:54.680 --> 01:59.400]  items. I'm bringing in my phone, I'm bringing in my tablet, and I'm bringing in my Xbox headset.
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.780]  So I can't fix the toilet. So what I do is I stack the lid on top of the seat in like a
[02:06.780 --> 02:13.160]  cross formation. I place the cupcake bowl on the toilet. It's fine. Nothing happens. It's
[02:13.160 --> 02:20.680]  perfectly balanced. I place the headset on there for a moment. This creates momentum.
[02:22.280 --> 02:29.800]  I have a choice to make. I can either drop my Xbox headset in the toilet and save my cupcakes,
[02:32.480 --> 02:41.580]  or I can let the cupcakes fall. I had to make a choice. This is the saddest photo I've ever taken.
[02:47.020 --> 02:51.560]  Whoa. You want to see where that clip's from and all the other clips that you're
