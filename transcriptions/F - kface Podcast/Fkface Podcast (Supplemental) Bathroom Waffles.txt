[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  I bought myself a waffle maker. I make morning waffles as soon as I wake up.
[00:04.120 --> 00:08.920]  I put it in my bathroom. I brush my teeth. I mix a waffle. I have a waffle every day.
[00:09.040 --> 00:11.200]  Did you say you put the waffle in your bathroom?
[00:11.540 --> 00:17.320]  I do because the sink is right there and I have the mixer under the sink and then I have the powder.
[00:17.680 --> 00:21.680]  You can't just casually say these things. Are you an insane person? What do you mean?
[00:22.220 --> 00:27.940]  No, no. Listen, being able to make a breakfast food from your room is revolutionary. It's maybe
[00:27.940 --> 00:31.460]  the greatest thing I've ever done. I probably should move it out of the bathroom now that I
[00:31.460 --> 00:34.800]  think about it. That's a moisture area. There's a reason that, yeah, like a bathroom,
[00:34.960 --> 00:40.160]  not the most hygienic place. If you've got a toilet in there, there's like fecal particles.
[00:40.680 --> 00:43.440]  The lid's down by us. You're flushing that thing. It's going everywhere,
[00:43.760 --> 00:47.520]  landing on your waffle machine. It's all of that stuff in the bathroom with the waffle maker.
[00:47.680 --> 00:51.840]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I got my measuring cup under the sink and then I got the mix
[00:51.840 --> 00:54.940]  in one of the side drawers next to my razors and stuff.
[00:55.800 --> 01:00.620]  Andrew, I'm going to just... this is a bad idea. Can I can I come out in support of this? I think
[01:00.620 --> 01:07.100]  the opposite of Gavin. I think this is ingenious and I think it's efficient and I'm all for it.
[01:07.140 --> 01:10.660]  This is... I don't even know how to approach this. You guys are going to laugh.
[01:11.020 --> 01:14.160]  I feel like you're about to admit something that you know is insane to us.
[01:14.280 --> 01:21.540]  Well, I was on Amazon yesterday and I'm running low. I'm running low on some mix and they had
[01:21.540 --> 01:25.320]  really good deal on and I thought, you know, it'd be good. I'm really enjoying this. This is
[01:25.320 --> 01:30.800]  a lifestyle change. I'm just going to buy. I'm just going to buy some some pancake mix,
[01:31.020 --> 01:37.100]  assuming it would work with my waffle maker. And I kind of panic when they show only a few
[01:37.100 --> 01:44.000]  of the items left. I buy all of them. Ten pounds? You bought 70 pounds of pancake mix?
[01:44.040 --> 01:50.180]  Ten pounds times seven. Did it come on a pallet? I bought 70 pounds of pancake mix.
[01:50.180 --> 01:55.420]  Oh, my God. How long is it going to take you to eat 70 pounds?
[01:55.780 --> 02:02.800]  That's the other problem. It's not 70 pounds of food. You're adding stuff to the mix. It's
[02:02.800 --> 02:06.600]  going to be way more than 70. You're going to be eating like 200 pounds of pancakes.
[02:07.020 --> 02:12.880]  I viewed this as like my lifetime supply of pancake waffle mix. I figured I'd be good for
[02:12.880 --> 02:16.400]  a long time. I'm never going to have to think about it again. It's fantastic.
[02:17.100 --> 02:19.520]  It's not like honey, though. It's going to expire.
[02:19.520 --> 02:20.760]  Yeah, won't it go bad?
[02:20.760 --> 02:25.420]  I'm getting to that. It turns out that the Krusty's buttermilk pancake mix
[02:26.050 --> 02:29.380]  is best before six months from when they made it.
[02:29.420 --> 02:29.520]  Oh, no!
[02:29.720 --> 02:37.440]  God. So, if I wanted to consume all of my pancake slash waffle within the time it was good,
[02:37.560 --> 02:43.140]  I need to eat a little bit more than ten pounds a month of waffles.
[02:43.420 --> 02:48.040]  What's crazy, this isn't an error. This is a f*** face. You've done this because
[02:48.040 --> 02:49.760]  you are you and it's funny.
[02:50.080 --> 02:54.720]  Oh, I was very excited when I made this order that this was a great decision. And then I woke up
[02:54.720 --> 02:59.860]  this morning and thought, I can't believe I bought 70 pounds of mix for a thing that might not turn
[02:59.860 --> 03:01.580]  out. These could be total shit.
[03:01.940 --> 03:03.780]  So then she said, I poisoned the turkey.
[03:05.240 --> 03:07.900]  You know, it's great spending time with friends and family around the holidays.
[03:08.120 --> 03:11.380]  You know what else is great? These looks you can get at store.roosterteeth.com.
[03:11.680 --> 03:12.500]  Happy holidays.
[03:14.680 --> 03:15.400]  Is he okay?
[03:18.600 --> 03:19.820]  Let's cut there, I think that's it.
