[00:00.000 --> 00:03.800]  When I went to pick this up, it was nothing but work trucks and my Hyundai accent.
[00:06.500 --> 00:07.820]  Okay, what are we doing?
[00:08.300 --> 00:09.240]  We're going to dig a bean hole.
[00:09.560 --> 00:10.220]  We're going to dig...
[00:10.220 --> 00:10.660]  Bean hole soup?
[00:10.720 --> 00:11.960]  Here's what we said we were going to do.
[00:12.060 --> 00:12.220]  Yeah.
[00:12.380 --> 00:18.320]  We were going to dig a six-foot bean hole, and at the bottom of it, we're going to put a USB drive with us talking about digging the six-foot bean hole.
[00:18.460 --> 00:18.560]  Yeah.
[00:18.680 --> 00:19.780]  Now, we've prepared none of that.
[00:19.820 --> 00:20.020]  No.
[00:20.260 --> 00:26.420]  But we are going to dig a six-foot bean hole, or at least as far as we can get, and then we're going to transfer all the dirt into those buckets.
[00:26.700 --> 00:26.860]  Yeah.
[00:26.920 --> 00:27.400]  Here, I'll show you.
[00:27.400 --> 00:30.440]  It's not enough buckets for six feet.
[00:30.860 --> 00:31.640]  It's not.
[00:31.800 --> 00:35.320]  It's enough buckets for 2,000 bean hole pins.
[00:35.440 --> 00:43.980]  So, if you're getting one of these pens with our bean hole dirt, you are witnessing the video where we have dug up the dirt.
[00:44.120 --> 00:45.840]  Try and look out for your specific dirt.
[00:46.220 --> 00:46.420]  Yeah.
[00:46.740 --> 00:47.500]  Because you'll have it.
[00:47.540 --> 00:48.100]  Have a look.
[00:48.260 --> 00:51.340]  It's also being sifted, but it's mud.
[00:52.760 --> 00:56.000]  We have two attachments for it.
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.120]  We got the one for rocks.
[00:59.280 --> 00:59.520]  Uh-huh.
[00:59.720 --> 01:06.520]  But then he's like, just in case, you know, he asked me what kind of job we were doing today, and I went, oh, you know, digging through...
[01:07.100 --> 01:09.720]  I was telling Gavin, you have to go into, like, day labor work mode.
[01:09.920 --> 01:14.520]  And you're like, ah, you know, boss said getting through some heavy clay.
[01:14.840 --> 01:18.840]  We're going to get through a slab, a little concrete slab, so it's not going to be much.
[01:19.100 --> 01:23.120]  And he's like, oh, if you're doing clay, you're doing dirt, we'll do this because I don't have any...
[01:23.120 --> 01:26.580]  He just ran out of the actual, like, spade for dirt.
[01:26.980 --> 01:29.680]  Then he's like, oh, last guy just got it. This is the last one that they had.
[01:30.360 --> 01:35.220]  And so we have this. When we get inevitably, I suppose, to a rock, we have this.
[01:35.540 --> 01:37.940]  But if we want to get through some dirt, we have this.
[01:38.220 --> 01:40.600]  Here's what I'm looking at on your ground.
[01:40.920 --> 01:44.080]  None of this is dried out, and it is as wet as it was a week ago.
[01:44.200 --> 01:45.800]  Yeah, yeah, it's still wet.
[01:46.940 --> 01:48.780]  We can make a USB eventually.
[01:48.920 --> 01:50.320]  We will, we will. We'll leave the hole.
[01:50.660 --> 01:54.220]  Which Emily will be thrilled by. She also told you not to mess up your hands.
[01:54.560 --> 01:56.220]  Yeah, because we're getting married in two weeks, right?
[01:56.320 --> 01:58.860]  And I just got, like, a new tattoo, and we're getting, like...
[01:58.860 --> 01:59.280]  You got a new tattoo?
[01:59.460 --> 02:00.240]  Yeah, a little wedding tattoo.
[02:00.840 --> 02:01.540]  Oh, that's fun.
[02:01.780 --> 02:02.340]  A cute little king of hearts.
[02:02.820 --> 02:04.800]  There's going to be a tattoo artist at the wedding, so...
[02:04.800 --> 02:05.400]  It's, like, K for Emily.
[02:05.640 --> 02:08.880]  Anyway, yeah, K for king. King of hearts. She's the queen of hearts. She got a Q.
[02:08.980 --> 02:10.920]  I also have our room key from Key West, though.
[02:10.980 --> 02:12.460]  Yeah, you have been wearing that.
[02:12.460 --> 02:13.020]  I haven't taken it off.
[02:13.040 --> 02:13.840]  No, you have not.
[02:15.420 --> 02:17.480]  That is soft.
[02:18.040 --> 02:19.140]  Did not need that.
[02:19.140 --> 02:20.880]  That's how fucking strong I am.
[02:20.940 --> 02:22.200]  Maybe we start with shovels.
[02:22.220 --> 02:22.500]  Uh-huh.
[02:22.680 --> 02:23.500]  That's, like, uh...
[02:23.500 --> 02:23.840]  Whoa!
[02:24.780 --> 02:25.600]  I'm, like, Thor.
[02:26.260 --> 02:28.640]  You're just... Hey, dude, you're just like Thor.
[02:28.640 --> 02:29.720]  I'm, like, Chris Hemsworth.
[02:29.820 --> 02:29.920]  Yeah.
[02:32.660 --> 02:33.860]  Oh, I felt the thud of that.
[02:34.100 --> 02:35.420]  Wow, we're already halfway down.
[02:37.180 --> 02:39.040]  Oh, yeah, what do we do if we hit a power line?
[02:40.180 --> 02:41.180]  Oh, yeah, we won't.
[02:41.560 --> 02:42.240]  Or a pipe.
[02:42.480 --> 02:42.920]  We won't.
[02:43.060 --> 02:44.500]  Okay. What's this? What's this here?
[02:45.060 --> 02:45.600]  That's my house.
[02:46.060 --> 02:47.180]  No, the wire.
[02:47.420 --> 02:48.320]  Oh, I think that's my internet.
[02:48.320 --> 02:49.840]  Don't ask him about wires or outlets.
[02:49.960 --> 02:52.600]  He doesn't know the schematics and won't know them offhand.
[02:52.600 --> 02:53.380]  I think that's my internet.
[02:53.660 --> 02:56.140]  Okay, because you are about four inches from pulling it down.
[02:57.120 --> 02:57.260]  Oh.
[02:58.020 --> 02:58.980]  Watch out for that.
[02:59.480 --> 03:00.060]  It might be nothing.
[03:00.080 --> 03:01.640]  Turn the other face this way.
[03:06.180 --> 03:08.060]  Is the helicopter coming for us?
[03:09.100 --> 03:10.100]  Oh, my God.
[03:13.340 --> 03:13.780]  Wow.
[03:19.720 --> 03:21.720]  All right, that's the first scoop.
[03:22.440 --> 03:23.320]  There it is.
[03:23.440 --> 03:24.060]  Spot your dirt.
[03:25.720 --> 03:26.900]  How many pins do you think that is?
[03:27.360 --> 03:27.920]  Four and five.
[03:28.700 --> 03:29.340]  We go...
[03:30.340 --> 03:33.680]  I think we go as deep as we need to for the pins, right?
[03:33.700 --> 03:33.860]  Yeah.
[03:33.980 --> 03:35.680]  Or do you think we should try to actually hit six feet?
[03:36.260 --> 03:36.580]  Um...
[03:36.580 --> 03:37.040]  Six feet.
[03:37.180 --> 03:41.160]  I don't know that we can hit six feet with the size of the hole that we're going to try to dig here.
[03:41.620 --> 03:43.760]  We're going to have to get really wide if we want six feet.
[03:43.920 --> 03:45.060]  Narrow and deep like our podcast.
[03:45.660 --> 03:48.300]  There's no way that's going to get narrow and deep.
[03:48.460 --> 03:50.840]  Well, that's only for emergencies. We may not even use it.
[03:51.320 --> 03:52.080]  Ah, we got to use it.
[03:52.500 --> 03:54.880]  I mean, if we don't have any emergency, we'll find an emergency.
[03:55.780 --> 03:57.440]  Sounds like someone who didn't have to get that out of a car.
[04:00.020 --> 04:03.760]  It's weird how you pickaxed it and it was so easy.
[04:03.980 --> 04:06.480]  And then we start hitting it with shovels and, like, really getting down there.
[04:06.760 --> 04:07.500]  It's a lot of work.
[04:07.620 --> 04:08.320]  It gets hard immediately.
[04:08.460 --> 04:08.960]  It does.
[04:09.720 --> 04:10.460]  No rocks yet, though.
[04:10.760 --> 04:12.080]  No, but I think we're going to...
[04:12.080 --> 04:12.380]  Well...
[04:12.380 --> 04:17.360]  I think we're looking at root and mud.
[04:17.420 --> 04:19.480]  Whenever they sift out, do we have it back?
[04:19.580 --> 04:20.620]  Do we fill the hole with it?
[04:21.520 --> 04:24.540]  I didn't think about it, but something's got to go back in this hole other than the USB drives.
[04:25.200 --> 04:27.600]  What about, like, 1,600 USB drives?
[04:29.540 --> 04:30.700]  Yeah, what about that?
[04:31.360 --> 04:31.720]  Eric?
[04:32.000 --> 04:32.220]  Yeah?
[04:32.480 --> 04:34.100]  Can you get us 1,600 USB drives?
[04:34.160 --> 04:34.980]  No, I don't think so.
[04:35.080 --> 04:38.220]  That'd be the funny thing. You get 1,600 of them, but 1,599 are empty.
[04:39.360 --> 04:40.480]  You have to find the real one.
[04:40.700 --> 04:41.620]  Find the real drive.
[04:43.220 --> 04:44.180]  Uh-oh.
[04:44.180 --> 04:44.800]  Uh-oh.
[04:45.560 --> 04:46.720]  It's one of those wood rocks.
[04:48.420 --> 04:48.720]  Uh-oh.
[04:49.740 --> 04:50.760]  What the fuck?
[04:51.140 --> 04:51.700]  Straight in there.
[04:51.720 --> 04:52.480]  Slow down, slow down.
[04:52.580 --> 04:53.000]  How's this go?
[04:56.440 --> 04:58.080]  You're trying to attach it to the cart.
[05:00.660 --> 05:02.220]  We should unplug it first.
[05:02.800 --> 05:09.760]  So this lifts up.
[05:10.160 --> 05:12.360]  This comes out, because that's the jacking.
[05:12.460 --> 05:12.680]  Yeah.
[05:14.420 --> 05:15.980]  That's just a carrying case, then.
[05:16.060 --> 05:16.760]  Yeah, exactly.
[05:17.080 --> 05:18.560]  Try not to get mud up its dirt hole.
[05:18.600 --> 05:19.080]  Yeah, I'm trying.
[05:19.200 --> 05:21.020]  I mean, it's an attachment hole.
[05:25.390 --> 05:26.370]  Does that lock it down?
[05:26.550 --> 05:27.970]  I think it has to go all the way.
[05:28.010 --> 05:29.650]  Yeah, pull that bar all the way to the...
[05:32.930 --> 05:33.290]  Okay.
[05:33.550 --> 05:34.270]  Oh, that's in there.
[05:34.570 --> 05:41.450]  Okay, so let's move it into position, and then I'll plug it in, and then Geoff is going to jackhammer it.
[05:41.650 --> 05:42.710]  Alright, here we go. Clear.
[05:42.710 --> 05:42.770]  Clear.
[05:46.210 --> 05:47.130]  Okay, it's plugged.
[05:55.560 --> 05:57.060]  It just went through a tree!
[05:57.220 --> 05:57.980]  Oh my god!
[05:58.960 --> 06:00.520]  That's the coolest thing I've ever seen!
[06:01.700 --> 06:03.060]  That's the coolest thing I've ever done!
[06:08.960 --> 06:11.160]  I feel like Superman. I get construction.
[06:14.040 --> 06:24.060]  Is it coming out? No, you're good, you're good, you're good.
[06:24.460 --> 06:26.460]  You drove that all the way to the mud.
[06:27.360 --> 06:28.480]  Alright, well that lives here now.
[06:30.520 --> 06:31.240]  Dude, wow!
[06:31.740 --> 06:32.380]  Here, grab that side.
[06:32.580 --> 06:33.960]  Ready? Hang on, wait, wait, wait.
[06:35.100 --> 06:35.920]  Just in case.
[06:36.160 --> 06:37.060]  Maybe the coolest thing.
[06:37.400 --> 06:38.040]  I'm not taking any photos.
[06:38.340 --> 06:40.920]  Emily will kill me if you get hurt. Ready? One, two, three.
[06:42.620 --> 06:44.180]  Hang on. Ready?
[06:47.260 --> 06:47.980]  Okay, let's...
[06:47.980 --> 06:49.440]  Okay, now let's lift.
[06:49.640 --> 06:50.660]  Really wrenching it there.
[06:50.860 --> 06:52.080]  One, two, three.
[06:53.080 --> 06:53.720]  Nope, alright.
[06:56.460 --> 06:58.460]  I love that you were so excited you just kept going down.
[06:58.660 --> 06:59.240]  It's so much fun.
[07:00.120 --> 07:00.700]  Yo, let's get it.
[07:02.640 --> 07:03.260]  Hey, what's up?
[07:05.440 --> 07:07.180]  Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm coming. Hang on.
[07:08.180 --> 07:09.380]  Nick's here too, so...
[07:09.380 --> 07:09.940]  What's up, dude?
[07:10.140 --> 07:10.960]  How's it going, guys?
[07:11.740 --> 07:13.780]  It's going great, dude. Have you ever used a jacket before?
[07:13.860 --> 07:14.180]  Never.
[07:14.260 --> 07:14.900]  I recommend it.
[07:15.480 --> 07:18.440]  Geoff has, and it's stuck now, so we gotta figure that out.
[07:19.520 --> 07:20.480]  We just gotta clean up some space.
[07:20.780 --> 07:22.260]  You know, worst come to worst, we just bury it.
[07:22.420 --> 07:23.700]  Yeah. How much does it cost?
[07:23.940 --> 07:24.600]  $7,000.
[07:24.980 --> 07:25.560]  Ah, fuck.
[07:27.240 --> 07:29.100]  Ready? One, two, three.
[07:29.780 --> 07:30.760]  Oh my god.
[07:30.880 --> 07:31.000]  Yeah.
[07:31.800 --> 07:34.280]  There's nothing going against it.
[07:34.560 --> 07:40.920]  Yeah, Geoff got really excited and just started staring into the camera as he drove down into the mud and it just kept going.
[07:41.080 --> 07:42.100]  I did do that, I did do that.
[07:43.260 --> 07:44.520]  There it is, there it goes.
[07:44.600 --> 07:44.780]  Oh.
[07:45.240 --> 07:46.440]  It's just in there.
[07:47.060 --> 07:47.500]  Whoa.
[07:47.760 --> 07:47.960]  Yeah.
[07:48.340 --> 07:49.040]  There you go.
[07:49.120 --> 07:50.000]  Good job, Geoff.
[07:52.440 --> 07:53.100]  You lift it?
[07:53.260 --> 07:53.580]  Yeah!
[07:53.920 --> 07:54.520]  There it is.
[07:57.680 --> 07:58.480]  Start a second hole?
[07:58.820 --> 07:59.120]  Oh.
[08:00.180 --> 08:01.260]  We're just starting a second hole.
[08:01.340 --> 08:02.780]  We'll connect them, yeah.
[08:03.020 --> 08:03.300]  Holy shit.
[08:03.660 --> 08:05.340]  He said that there was a tree here that died.
[08:05.760 --> 08:08.340]  Yeah, I lost this tree in the freeze, the first freeze.
[08:08.700 --> 08:09.020]  Oh.
[08:10.360 --> 08:11.480]  Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[08:11.560 --> 08:12.360]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[08:12.500 --> 08:12.900]  Slow down.
[08:13.540 --> 08:14.840]  Stop. Don't plug it in.
[08:15.100 --> 08:16.400]  Jesus fucking Christ, hang on.
[08:17.220 --> 08:18.520]  Let's change to that.
[08:18.780 --> 08:19.340]  Yeah, let's do it.
[08:19.400 --> 08:21.400]  So that way it doesn't stick, it splits.
[08:21.760 --> 08:21.880]  Yeah.
[08:22.940 --> 08:23.260]  Christ.
[08:23.900 --> 08:24.460]  Give me a hand there.
[08:24.860 --> 08:25.080]  Okay.
[08:25.080 --> 08:25.660]  Give me a hand there.
[08:26.900 --> 08:29.100]  I was thinking that Unifarm could start getting into giant, uh...
[08:29.100 --> 08:30.720]  Wait, it has to be on the ground flat.
[08:30.880 --> 08:31.580]  Oh, flat? Okay.
[08:31.760 --> 08:33.260]  No, jackhammer tool attachments.
[08:33.560 --> 08:34.880]  Do you want to do, like, a big toothbrush?
[08:35.720 --> 08:36.360]  Toilet brush.
[08:37.260 --> 08:38.200]  I think that's a great idea.
[08:38.300 --> 08:39.520]  Like, what other...
[08:39.520 --> 08:39.800]  There you go.
[08:39.800 --> 08:41.420]  What other things could use the jackhammer tool?
[08:41.420 --> 08:42.160]  Yeah, like a mop?
[08:42.820 --> 08:50.360]  I was telling him, there were so many attachments the guy had, but there were just, like, a million of them.
[08:50.460 --> 08:52.000]  I wonder if we could collaborate with Swiffer.
[08:52.200 --> 08:54.240]  Yeah, and it's just like, I don't think there's money in this.
[08:55.080 --> 08:56.100]  I want to turn at some point.
[08:56.180 --> 08:56.340]  Okay.
[08:57.020 --> 08:59.460]  This is why we don't plug it in yet, but it's fine.
[09:01.740 --> 09:02.860]  Just right back to it.
[09:14.730 --> 09:16.410]  No tree is safe from man.
[09:17.610 --> 09:17.990]  Wow.
[09:18.810 --> 09:19.490]  Well, it's dead.
[09:20.230 --> 09:20.570]  Grab it.
[09:20.750 --> 09:21.290]  There you go.
[09:21.430 --> 09:21.930]  Look at that.
[09:24.430 --> 09:26.770]  Yeah, that's it. Chip away.
[09:30.010 --> 09:31.450]  What are you doing?
[09:31.910 --> 09:32.930]  What the fuck?
[09:33.910 --> 09:34.890]  What's the angle?
[09:37.390 --> 09:37.830]  Stop.
[09:38.690 --> 09:39.130]  Stop!
[09:40.390 --> 09:40.830]  Stop!
[09:41.230 --> 09:42.670]  There'll be nothing of this tree left.
[09:44.190 --> 09:44.650]  You need a hand?
[09:45.870 --> 09:46.510]  I'll take a hand.
[09:47.730 --> 09:48.630]  Ready? There you go.
[09:48.850 --> 09:49.790]  One, two, three.
[09:50.570 --> 09:51.290]  It's a lot of work.
[09:51.490 --> 09:53.270]  It's like jackhammer caddies.
[09:56.470 --> 09:57.310]  Here goes Eric.
[10:06.780 --> 10:08.980]  Dude, it is, like, that tree.
[10:10.340 --> 10:10.500]  Dude.
[10:12.860 --> 10:15.360]  That's why nobody looks like us when they do this.
[10:15.380 --> 10:16.100]  They're big.
[10:16.820 --> 10:17.660]  Everybody looks like The Rock.
[10:17.720 --> 10:17.920]  Yeah.
[10:18.680 --> 10:19.040]  Fuck.
[10:19.700 --> 10:21.640]  Tony said, like, two buckets should be enough,
[10:21.740 --> 10:23.780]  but, you know, we can't trust Tony.
[10:24.100 --> 10:24.340]  Right.
[10:24.820 --> 10:27.480]  If you think about it, this is kind of Minecraft, right?
[10:28.480 --> 10:31.660]  Dude, if it was Minecraft, Geoff would be digging with the pickaxe still.
[10:31.820 --> 10:34.280]  It looks so much fucking easier in Minecraft.
[10:34.580 --> 10:35.880]  We'd also be a lot further, I think.
[10:36.580 --> 10:38.020]  Yo, we would have been all the way to hell.
[10:38.040 --> 10:38.960]  We'd be at bed right now.
[10:39.000 --> 10:39.020]  Oh, yeah.
[10:40.340 --> 10:42.680]  The sound is so satisfying.
[10:42.800 --> 10:43.180]  I agree.
[10:44.160 --> 10:46.980]  Now there's a sound, because we're hitting some solid stuff.
[10:47.360 --> 10:47.660]  Oh, good.
[10:50.080 --> 10:51.280]  You're in a pickaxe.
[10:51.360 --> 10:52.080]  You're going gloveless?
[10:52.680 --> 10:53.120]  I like it.
[10:53.140 --> 10:54.200]  These aren't dishes, I guess, right?
[10:56.200 --> 10:57.780]  I thought the head came off.
[10:59.000 --> 11:00.780]  The dirt that flung over there.
[11:00.840 --> 11:01.740]  That would have been loud, I think.
[11:08.250 --> 11:09.870]  Look at Eric being a supervisor over there.
[11:09.870 --> 11:11.090]  Yeah, it's like a Caltrans job.
[11:11.170 --> 11:11.770]  I love this.
[11:12.050 --> 11:12.410]  This is great.
[11:13.870 --> 11:15.390]  Eric's got contracting down.
[11:15.390 --> 11:16.050]  You're doing great.
[11:16.710 --> 11:17.470]  Keep going.
[11:19.010 --> 11:21.210]  Flip that side from stop to slow.
[11:23.750 --> 11:25.150]  I like your windup.
[11:25.290 --> 11:25.770]  I do, too.
[11:25.910 --> 11:26.550]  Look at the power.
[11:27.550 --> 11:30.110]  It's like fucking Raleigh Fingers over here with the pickaxe.
[11:32.230 --> 11:34.430]  I don't trust... you're, like, right at the edge.
[11:35.210 --> 11:35.970]  The edge of the handle?
[11:36.050 --> 11:37.910]  Yeah, you gotta, like, choke up a little bit, but...
[11:37.910 --> 11:39.610]  Well, the maximum power is right down here.
[11:39.630 --> 11:42.390]  I know, and it's also the maximum amount of...
[11:43.790 --> 11:45.570]  Max distance is achieved the same way.
[11:45.750 --> 11:46.390]  Yes, absolutely.
[11:48.050 --> 11:50.830]  You're why little kids get hit by flying bats at baseball games.
[11:52.110 --> 11:53.270]  Or fall into fires.
[11:53.410 --> 11:54.490]  I mean, it's the same sort of...
[11:55.190 --> 11:57.310]  Let's see if I get under this tree or if I'm just gonna hit more trees.
[11:58.210 --> 11:58.730]  Got it.
[11:59.130 --> 11:59.590]  Oh, wow.
[11:59.610 --> 12:00.690]  Wow, that was...
[12:00.690 --> 12:00.930]  Smart.
[12:04.710 --> 12:06.030]  You think that's the stump, huh?
[12:09.350 --> 12:10.990]  Hopefully the stump would not be gasoline.
[12:13.110 --> 12:14.770]  Here's the thing about trees, trees grow down.
[12:15.370 --> 12:17.310]  Alright, well, that didn't help us.
[12:17.350 --> 12:19.310]  Gavin gave us a solid 45 seconds of work there.
[12:19.410 --> 12:19.850]  Appreciate it, buddy.
[12:20.110 --> 12:21.350]  I assume you'll want to...
[12:21.350 --> 12:22.110]  Oh, you're gonna move on to that?
[12:22.570 --> 12:24.230]  Well, you have to take this out.
[12:29.500 --> 12:30.700]  By the tree, I guess.
[12:32.240 --> 12:34.160]  That's good, you're determining it in a radius.
[12:43.070 --> 12:44.710]  I was filming where muscle would be.
[12:46.810 --> 12:49.650]  I'm pretty excited for the comments on this video, where people go,
[12:49.650 --> 12:53.030]  These jackasses don't even know how to work a jackhammer.
[12:53.230 --> 12:53.530]  No, no.
[12:53.730 --> 12:54.470]  And that's true.
[12:54.710 --> 12:55.610]  That's why we're doing it.
[12:55.730 --> 12:56.370]  Yeah, that's right.
[12:56.370 --> 12:59.690]  If we knew how to work a jackhammer, we would know it wasn't necessary for the job.
[13:00.070 --> 13:00.110]  Yeah, 100%.
[13:00.110 --> 13:02.830]  If we knew how to work a jackhammer, we wouldn't be using it here.
[13:11.310 --> 13:12.810]  Guys, you know what this means?
[13:13.430 --> 13:14.250]  We're men now.
[13:14.510 --> 13:15.050]  We've done it.
[13:15.190 --> 13:16.130]  We're really men.
[13:16.450 --> 13:16.650]  Okay.
[13:18.370 --> 13:19.070]  Wait, I'm not done.
[13:19.190 --> 13:19.690]  Let's not do that.
[13:20.430 --> 13:21.250]  I'm gonna unplug it.
[13:33.620 --> 13:36.740]  Well, the audience knows, they're not just buying a pin.
[13:36.980 --> 13:39.740]  They're not just buying a pin full of bean hole dirt.
[13:40.740 --> 13:43.160]  They're buying a pin full of blood and sweat.
[13:43.700 --> 13:43.840]  What?
[13:44.000 --> 13:44.380]  And effort.
[13:44.700 --> 13:44.860]  And cum.
[13:45.460 --> 13:45.580]  What?
[13:47.420 --> 13:49.060]  There's just a lot of sweat and effort.
[13:49.940 --> 13:50.780]  Pumping blood.
[13:51.260 --> 13:53.380]  Getting this dirt out was not easy.
[13:53.480 --> 13:54.240]  They're buying our effort.
[13:54.500 --> 13:55.740]  Do you not think there should be some cum?
[13:56.560 --> 13:56.920]  What?
[14:00.460 --> 14:01.860]  I don't think there should be any.
[14:03.560 --> 14:04.200]  20 inches?
[14:05.940 --> 14:06.940]  What's that, a couple feet?
[14:07.560 --> 14:08.560]  It's like eight of my dick.
[14:09.700 --> 14:10.740]  I wanna hit a rock.
[14:11.020 --> 14:12.580]  I wanna use this jackhammer on a rock.
[14:12.800 --> 14:14.480]  I don't think we're gonna hit a rock over here.
[14:14.920 --> 14:16.260]  Oh look, we found one in the dirt.
[14:25.240 --> 14:26.560]  That was fast, too.
[14:30.020 --> 14:30.760]  Movie magic.
[14:30.880 --> 14:31.460]  Here we go.
[14:32.000 --> 14:33.120]  Hey Geoff, I hit something.
[14:33.460 --> 14:34.100]  I got it.
[14:34.240 --> 14:34.380]  Alright.
[14:35.200 --> 14:37.620]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[14:37.820 --> 14:38.540]  Stop, stop.
[14:39.040 --> 14:40.080]  It's the wrong bit.
[14:41.520 --> 14:41.920]  It's the wrong bit.
[14:41.920 --> 14:43.100]  It is the wrong fucking bit.
[14:43.260 --> 14:44.640]  You're right, you're right, you're right.
[14:45.020 --> 14:45.660]  I know!
[14:46.240 --> 14:46.900]  Oh, you picked it up.
[14:47.040 --> 14:47.140]  Hey!
[14:48.500 --> 14:50.740]  Being told you're right, it feels good.
[14:50.840 --> 14:52.700]  But everyone should just know that from the get-go.
[14:52.880 --> 14:53.580]  Oh, you're always right?
[14:53.640 --> 14:54.200]  From jump.
[14:54.560 --> 14:55.960]  Just, just, oh yeah.
[14:56.300 --> 14:57.220]  Eric's right about this one.
[14:57.640 --> 14:58.040]  Sometimes...
[15:00.880 --> 15:02.460]  Oh my God!
[15:10.050 --> 15:11.270]  Jesus Christ, dude.
[15:11.470 --> 15:11.790]  Yeah.
[15:15.550 --> 15:17.290]  It's crazy how you hit that rock, Nick.
[15:17.750 --> 15:18.170]  Buff.
[15:18.510 --> 15:19.230]  Came out of nowhere.
[15:22.230 --> 15:23.650]  Just what we were talking about.
[15:29.050 --> 15:30.550]  I thought we'd get further.
[15:32.030 --> 15:33.110]  Let's take a look here.
[15:33.270 --> 15:34.350]  I'll hold this end for you.
[15:35.010 --> 15:35.770]  You go on ahead.
[15:35.770 --> 15:36.670]  Do you want to film?
[15:37.190 --> 15:37.710]  Yeah, I'm filming.
[15:37.790 --> 15:39.170]  Want to check our progress, see how far down we are?
[15:39.350 --> 15:39.470]  Let's take a look and see.
[15:39.550 --> 15:41.130]  Getting close, watch that six foot.
[15:41.250 --> 15:42.010]  Watch this.
[15:42.370 --> 15:43.050]  Yeah, alright.
[15:43.370 --> 15:43.530]  Alright.
[15:43.530 --> 15:45.270]  Let's take a look at that.
[15:45.370 --> 15:46.350]  What you got there?
[15:46.490 --> 15:46.810]  Wow!
[15:47.830 --> 15:48.610]  How far down is it?
[15:48.630 --> 15:49.850]  Oh my God, we hit seven feet!
[15:50.050 --> 15:50.350]  Wow!
[15:50.830 --> 15:52.110]  We overshot it?
[15:52.430 --> 15:52.750]  Wow.
[15:52.910 --> 15:53.510]  That's crazy.
[15:54.070 --> 15:55.470]  I think maybe I'm at the wrong angle for this.
[15:55.950 --> 15:56.490]  You want to try again?
[15:56.630 --> 15:58.230]  I think you're definitely at the...
[15:58.230 --> 16:00.190]  You're so far away.
[16:00.290 --> 16:00.490]  Yeah.
[16:02.590 --> 16:04.890]  We're close, we're five, still got a little bit of room to go.
[16:04.890 --> 16:05.450]  Oh yeah.
[16:05.690 --> 16:06.610]  We're not done yet.
[16:06.710 --> 16:07.270]  Oh yeah, look!
[16:07.690 --> 16:08.210]  Eight feet!
[16:08.370 --> 16:08.930]  Oh, that's crazy.
[16:08.970 --> 16:09.070]  Wow!
[16:09.430 --> 16:10.150]  We went far!
[16:10.270 --> 16:11.670]  And I bottomed out right there.
[16:11.850 --> 16:12.510]  Can't go any further.
[16:12.630 --> 16:13.330]  Where's the lava pit?
[16:14.370 --> 16:16.250]  Here, Nick, let go and I'm going to pull it back up.
[16:18.710 --> 16:19.070]  Alright!
[16:21.090 --> 16:21.870]  We did it!
[16:22.190 --> 16:23.070]  That wasn't so hard!
[16:26.210 --> 16:27.130]  That's a lot of pens.
[16:28.590 --> 16:29.310]  Thumbnail potential.
[16:31.310 --> 16:32.070]  Here, how about this?
[16:36.830 --> 16:37.690]  Thank you.
[16:39.230 --> 16:40.290]  You guys ready for lunch?
