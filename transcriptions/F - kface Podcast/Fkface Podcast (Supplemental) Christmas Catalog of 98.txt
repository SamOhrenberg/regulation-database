[00:10.220 --> 00:14.960]  Here we go with the final piece of a 98 content.
[00:15.160 --> 00:17.300]  Eric's favorite year, the last good year in Eric's opinion.
[00:17.600 --> 00:20.540]  We're going to do something a little bit unique for the end of the season.
[00:20.680 --> 00:21.920]  It's the holiday time.
[00:22.060 --> 00:26.600]  And something that I was worried was just specific to my childhood experience,
[00:26.680 --> 00:28.420]  but seems to be universal.
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.000]  And everyone I've talked to, for the most part, went through the process
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.760]  of as a kid getting a Christmas catalog, at least to people of a certain age,
[00:38.760 --> 00:43.000]  where you get to look through like all of the classic gift items.
[00:43.120 --> 00:43.660]  Fuck you, Gavin.
[00:43.840 --> 00:46.480]  And circle maybe what you want.
[00:46.600 --> 00:48.540]  You could just see sort of what's out there.
[00:48.620 --> 00:50.900]  It was such an exciting time as a kid to look through it,
[00:50.920 --> 00:53.420]  like all the cool toys that you're never going to get.
[00:53.620 --> 00:54.580]  It was just fun.
[00:54.860 --> 00:57.400]  It was an iconic part of at least my childhood.
[00:57.520 --> 00:59.300]  And it sounds like many others.
[00:59.500 --> 01:04.960]  So this is a, to me, definitive catalog, which is the Sears catalog.
[01:05.580 --> 01:06.380]  Winter 98.
[01:06.380 --> 01:10.960]  We're going to get a great look at what the fashion was at the time of 98.
[01:11.180 --> 01:17.120]  The toys, just sort of a general full collection of what you could expect in 98.
[01:17.440 --> 01:22.300]  Isn't it funny how much possibility that catalog represented in your childhood?
[01:22.620 --> 01:25.900]  Like you're talking about like your parents weren't going to buy you any of that shit.
[01:26.100 --> 01:28.260]  Like my mom was never the mom that was like,
[01:28.380 --> 01:30.100]  here, circle what you want in the catalog.
[01:30.340 --> 01:30.920]  I'll get it for you.
[01:31.060 --> 01:33.380]  I was always like, hey, I went ahead and circled all this stuff
[01:33.380 --> 01:34.320]  so you can get it for me.
[01:34.320 --> 01:38.760]  My mom would be like, yeah, I'm buying you the USS flag aircraft carrier for G.I.
[01:38.820 --> 01:39.400]  Joe. Sure.
[01:39.440 --> 01:40.260]  I'll get right on that.
[01:40.320 --> 01:40.920]  That's $500.
[01:42.360 --> 01:44.860]  But when I was a kid, if I circled it, I thought it was possible.
[01:45.300 --> 01:45.880]  It was possible.
[01:46.000 --> 01:47.600]  Yeah, it's a great way of putting it.
[01:47.960 --> 01:52.140]  I also just, we're going to get some great photos of the time as well.
[01:52.200 --> 01:54.200]  Like there's going to be a lot of bullshit in this.
[01:54.680 --> 01:57.400]  I love going through these old catalogs because there are things that you look
[01:57.400 --> 01:59.180]  at and just go, that never worked.
[01:59.520 --> 02:01.640]  Somebody was excited and bought that at the time.
[02:01.700 --> 02:03.640]  That was never how they advertised it.
[02:03.640 --> 02:04.520]  That just didn't work.
[02:04.740 --> 02:08.620]  I used to think that constantly when I saw kids playing with like virtual reality.
[02:08.760 --> 02:09.720]  I was like, that's good.
[02:09.840 --> 02:10.820]  That's so cool.
[02:10.880 --> 02:11.880]  There's no way that worked.
[02:12.020 --> 02:13.100]  There's no way that was any fun.
[02:14.760 --> 02:16.700]  So, Nick, are you screen, you're screen capturing this?
[02:16.700 --> 02:17.260]  Oh, I got it.
[02:17.340 --> 02:17.780]  I got you.
[02:17.880 --> 02:18.240]  All right, cool.
[02:18.320 --> 02:21.640]  So you guys can watch the video version of this over on our YouTube channel
[02:21.640 --> 02:24.660]  or over on f***facepod.com if you want to watch the video version.
[02:24.760 --> 02:26.520]  No payments until the 1st of Feb.
[02:27.040 --> 02:28.900]  Until the 1st of Feb 1999.
[02:29.820 --> 02:31.380]  Oh, see, truly the best year.
[02:31.520 --> 02:31.960]  We could wait.
[02:32.060 --> 02:33.140]  Yeah, good stuff.
[02:33.140 --> 02:37.180]  All you have to, all you had to do was die before February 1st, 1990.
[02:37.320 --> 02:38.600]  That's all you had to do.
[02:38.680 --> 02:42.000]  You had one full month to enjoy all your gifts and then you could die.
[02:42.180 --> 02:42.800]  Fingers crossed.
[02:43.560 --> 02:45.880]  So this is the Sears catalog.
[02:47.020 --> 02:50.360]  The wish book holiday 1998 catalog that we're going through.
[02:50.440 --> 02:51.420]  Andrew sent me a link.
[02:51.900 --> 02:54.080]  Maybe we'll include that link here for you guys.
[02:54.140 --> 02:55.100]  If you want to jog through it.
[02:55.100 --> 02:57.240]  Oh, check this out.
[02:57.240 --> 02:59.160]  New rhythms drum kit.
[02:59.840 --> 03:00.340]  That font.
[03:00.340 --> 03:06.540]  Do you think that particular drum kit exists in use anywhere on Earth today?
[03:07.740 --> 03:08.620]  I know.
[03:08.740 --> 03:10.080]  No, I don't.
[03:10.200 --> 03:11.260]  Well, now it's just called rhythms.
[03:13.060 --> 03:14.740]  Like what do you think happens to all?
[03:14.820 --> 03:16.380]  They just end up in landfills somewhere.
[03:16.600 --> 03:19.740]  They must have made thousands of them must have existed, right?
[03:20.160 --> 03:21.080]  Oh, for sure.
[03:21.260 --> 03:25.680]  That drum kit that just says rock on it is definitely in a landfill somewhere.
[03:25.680 --> 03:43.300]  I mean, when you look at the kid at the top in the jean jacket shirt, he's playing a kick drum, a cymbal, a snare, and then three more slightly smaller snares that I think are supposed to be Tom's and are definitely not.
[03:43.660 --> 03:49.420]  It also appears that they've dressed him in a denim shirt that has a zipper pocket as if they don't trust him not to bend over.
[03:49.680 --> 03:53.120]  Yeah, but boy, everyone had this haircut.
[03:53.120 --> 03:53.940]  Oh, yeah.
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.880]  I want to draw attention as well to like the product names of a flair for the snare.
[04:02.300 --> 04:03.980]  So is this like a modular thing?
[04:04.120 --> 04:05.540]  Are you buying individual drums here?
[04:05.580 --> 04:07.100]  Are they all different full sets?
[04:07.300 --> 04:09.180]  It I think it's different kits.
[04:09.320 --> 04:13.380]  Like you can see the one on the left that says rock is C and that's never miss a beat.
[04:13.460 --> 04:17.040]  The one at the bottom is D, which is perfect percussions.
[04:17.460 --> 04:20.940]  Oh, the classic one is kid blue keeps it cool.
[04:23.120 --> 04:24.300]  I want to be kid blue.
[04:24.900 --> 04:25.300]  Absolutely.
[04:25.520 --> 04:26.940]  I feel like we immediately need two things.
[04:27.040 --> 04:30.380]  We need anyone who has any of these items to post pictures in the comments.
[04:30.380 --> 04:31.840]  If for some reason you have this.
[04:32.040 --> 04:34.460]  Yeah, I feel like we also need an inflation calculator.
[04:35.980 --> 04:38.860]  Dude, we absolutely need an inflation calculator.
[04:39.040 --> 04:40.240]  I saw a story the other day.
[04:40.260 --> 04:41.900]  Nick, will you get an inflation calculator going?
[04:42.180 --> 04:50.900]  I guess every year some organization figures out how much it would cost to give the gifts from the 12 days of Christmas and apparently this year.
[04:50.960 --> 04:52.140]  It's the most expensive ever.
[04:52.140 --> 04:55.580]  It would be like 48 grand to give those 12 gifts.
[04:56.480 --> 04:58.800]  Eight lords a leaping cost how much?
[04:59.240 --> 04:59.560]  A lot.
[05:00.280 --> 05:00.960]  Terrible.
[05:02.680 --> 05:04.040]  So here's...
[05:04.040 --> 05:05.580]  Oh, fuck.
[05:05.880 --> 05:06.740]  Gifts for...
[05:06.740 --> 05:08.360]  Oh, it's the little critter guy.
[05:08.900 --> 05:11.760]  Oh, that spinning lullaby bull.
[05:11.900 --> 05:12.660]  I remember that.
[05:15.700 --> 05:18.440]  The season's best baby's first Christmas.
[05:19.720 --> 05:22.480]  It was that baby lullaby ball.
[05:22.580 --> 05:26.000]  Was that a hand-me-up from one of your...
[05:26.000 --> 05:29.220]  I remember it lighting up and it would spin and make music.
[05:30.220 --> 05:30.940]  Oh, wow.
[05:31.660 --> 05:33.060]  I like that he's riding a zebra.
[05:33.600 --> 05:35.560]  Kevin, your brother's tired of playing with a zebra.
[05:36.620 --> 05:38.060]  He needs this more than he does.
[05:38.320 --> 05:39.320]  He's got a Super Nintendo.
[05:39.440 --> 05:40.980]  You can have his lullaby light ball.
[05:44.380 --> 05:46.980]  I like the zebra as a choice for a kid to be riding.
[05:47.140 --> 05:47.600]  I think that's pretty cool.
[05:47.600 --> 05:47.740]  Yeah.
[05:48.300 --> 05:48.960]  It's great.
[05:49.020 --> 05:51.100]  They were working on taming them back then.
[05:51.460 --> 05:52.900]  So what consoles would be in this?
[05:53.000 --> 05:55.340]  Are we talking N64 era around this time?
[05:55.560 --> 05:56.940]  Yeah, this would be the 64 PlayStation.
[05:57.140 --> 05:58.240]  PlayStation 1, yeah.
[05:59.100 --> 06:01.020]  These twins are too cute.
[06:01.700 --> 06:02.580]  They're nightmares.
[06:03.000 --> 06:03.860]  That's a horror story.
[06:04.020 --> 06:04.260]  Too cute.
[06:04.960 --> 06:06.480]  A handcrafted armoire.
[06:07.500 --> 06:10.540]  Great, as a child, the thing I want, an armoire.
[06:12.240 --> 06:14.540]  It's hard to tell the scale of some of this shit.
[06:14.740 --> 06:15.160]  It is.
[06:15.320 --> 06:15.740]  A big time.
[06:16.460 --> 06:18.560]  Mini grand for little hands.
[06:20.820 --> 06:21.480]  All right.
[06:21.480 --> 06:24.040]  I think we've bled all the comedy out of that page.
[06:24.080 --> 06:24.540]  This...
[06:24.540 --> 06:28.080]  Oh, the daddy kid is so fucking happy.
[06:28.480 --> 06:29.160]  This is...
[06:29.160 --> 06:29.460]  Or terrified.
[06:29.460 --> 06:31.120]  It's like a potato head, but he's like...
[06:31.120 --> 06:32.120]  Felt Mr. Potato Head?
[06:33.220 --> 06:34.060]  You can't...
[06:34.060 --> 06:35.620]  You can't take his pieces off.
[06:35.700 --> 06:36.260]  It's just him.
[06:36.460 --> 06:36.980]  So what's the point?
[06:37.060 --> 06:37.860]  This interactive...
[06:37.860 --> 06:40.080]  Oh, he's got 50 knock-knock jokes.
[06:40.380 --> 06:41.040]  Oh my god.
[06:41.040 --> 06:44.560]  I feel like they've taken all of what a potato head is and removed it.
[06:44.560 --> 06:46.500]  Well, they made him a stand-up comedian.
[06:46.680 --> 06:48.000]  He's got 50 knock-knock jokes.
[06:48.200 --> 06:48.320]  Yeah.
[06:48.480 --> 06:49.360]  He also...
[06:49.360 --> 06:54.900]  You kid his hat and he won't tell you the joke until the kid says who's there.
[06:55.480 --> 06:59.900]  That's like buying a pre-assembled Lego set, but it's all glued.
[07:00.560 --> 07:00.840]  Yeah.
[07:01.540 --> 07:02.000]  Yeah.
[07:02.060 --> 07:02.780]  That's like...
[07:02.780 --> 07:05.140]  You walk into a room and that Mr. Potato Head is just going...
[07:05.140 --> 07:05.980]  Knock-knock.
[07:06.580 --> 07:07.360]  Knock-knock.
[07:08.460 --> 07:09.160]  Knock-knock.
[07:09.260 --> 07:11.100]  Just waiting for anyone to respond to him.
[07:11.460 --> 07:12.380]  What's this globe?
[07:12.460 --> 07:13.760]  You meant to like color in the planet?
[07:14.560 --> 07:15.320]  What's happening there?
[07:16.300 --> 07:25.020]  Odyssey, the world's first atlas sphere combines the finest qualities of a globe, atlas, and computer to expand your family's horizon.
[07:25.140 --> 07:27.040]  It's a pen that reads out the country around you.
[07:27.040 --> 07:29.140]  Yeah, and then it tells you stuff about it.
[07:29.300 --> 07:29.680]  I think that's...
[07:29.680 --> 07:32.280]  Oh, it's facts, like population and all that stuff.
[07:34.260 --> 07:35.340]  $300 then.
[07:35.540 --> 07:38.180]  That's like a $700 hunk of shit.
[07:38.520 --> 07:39.680]  $300 is...
[07:39.680 --> 07:43.360]  $300 back in 98 is $5.63.16.
[07:43.480 --> 07:44.000]  Fuck you!
[07:44.780 --> 07:46.200]  That's a PS5.
[07:46.340 --> 07:47.620]  That's more than a PS5.
[07:48.440 --> 07:50.260]  And that's just Google Maps now.
[07:51.480 --> 07:54.940]  And also, good luck finding a computer that'll run that fucking program.
[07:55.120 --> 07:56.240]  Oh, yeah. Oh, shit.
[07:56.460 --> 07:57.160]  Jesus Christ.
[07:57.620 --> 07:58.680]  That's fucking crazy.
[07:58.980 --> 07:59.360]  Wow.
[08:00.400 --> 08:00.920]  Whoa!
[08:01.180 --> 08:01.540]  What?
[08:01.740 --> 08:02.200]  What is happening?
[08:02.800 --> 08:03.120]  Gavin, look!
[08:03.120 --> 08:03.540]  Gavin, look!
[08:03.600 --> 08:03.920]  Feet!
[08:04.640 --> 08:06.560]  That's an abominable snowman?
[08:07.620 --> 08:08.240]  He's only $10.
[08:08.240 --> 08:09.260]  Oh, magic show.
[08:09.720 --> 08:11.280]  I bet there's like a rope in there.
[08:11.540 --> 08:12.400]  There's the magic wand.
[08:12.520 --> 08:12.640]  Wow.
[08:12.640 --> 08:13.740]  I think I had that.
[08:14.000 --> 08:15.080]  Of course.
[08:15.240 --> 08:15.900]  The magic show?
[08:16.120 --> 08:17.480]  Yeah, I was terrible at it.
[08:17.680 --> 08:20.200]  I was gonna say, it's definitely...
[08:20.200 --> 08:23.120]  Listeners of this podcast at home are probably looking at this and going,
[08:23.260 --> 08:23.920]  I had that.
[08:24.100 --> 08:25.420]  That doesn't surprise me at all.
[08:25.800 --> 08:29.680]  I had a little magic show, and it had a rope in it to do rope tricks.
[08:29.960 --> 08:34.640]  And then, I think a week after I got it, I found the rope tied around the neck of a...
[08:34.640 --> 08:37.180]  like a plushy dog that my...
[08:37.180 --> 08:39.620]  one of my siblings had just taken the rope and used it as a leash.
[08:39.740 --> 08:41.200]  And I could never undo the knot.
[08:41.520 --> 08:43.620]  And it just stayed on the dog for the rest of time.
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.660]  Was it the same rope trick that the driver at the ghost tour showed us in Key West?
[08:49.040 --> 08:49.280]  Oh!
[08:49.500 --> 08:50.180]  Ha ha ha!
[08:50.520 --> 08:51.120]  Ha ha ha!
[08:51.120 --> 08:51.340]  Oh!
[08:52.660 --> 08:53.240]  Good stuff!
[08:53.260 --> 08:54.060]  Do you remember that?
[08:54.200 --> 08:56.080]  Where he tied the knot in half and then there wasn't a knot?
[08:56.100 --> 08:56.800]  Yeah, I bet...
[08:56.800 --> 08:58.500]  I bet the instructions for that were in the book.
[08:58.920 --> 09:03.260]  Obviously, I had a dog on the end of my rope, which would have hindered the...
[09:03.260 --> 09:04.220]  some of the timing.
[09:04.880 --> 09:07.780]  I had a thing that was like the little air hockey thing when I was a kid.
[09:07.920 --> 09:08.360]  It was like...
[09:08.360 --> 09:09.840]  It was like really small, and it wasn't...
[09:09.840 --> 09:10.600]  It's not like a blue air.
[09:10.680 --> 09:11.460]  It was just a little thing.
[09:12.120 --> 09:12.800]  But I loved it.
[09:13.000 --> 09:13.340]  It was great.
[09:13.340 --> 09:16.020]  I'm getting like Bonsai Buddy vibes off the...
[09:16.020 --> 09:16.500]  Yeah.
[09:17.620 --> 09:18.060]  Oh!
[09:18.500 --> 09:19.800]  This is the thing that I had!
[09:19.960 --> 09:20.500]  The little...
[09:20.500 --> 09:20.700]  Ah!
[09:21.220 --> 09:21.980]  I had this!
[09:22.140 --> 09:23.240]  The smallest pool table!
[09:23.700 --> 09:24.700]  Five in one?
[09:25.020 --> 09:26.320]  I had the five in one.
[09:27.040 --> 09:28.900]  Yeah, someone gave it to me for my birthday.
[09:29.340 --> 09:29.840]  When I was like...
[09:30.360 --> 09:30.700]  Ten?
[09:30.760 --> 09:31.800]  I think I like turned ten.
[09:32.180 --> 09:33.220]  And I had that.
[09:33.440 --> 09:33.960]  I did too!
[09:33.960 --> 09:34.160]  It was great.
[09:34.600 --> 09:36.080]  Hands off my stuff!
[09:36.240 --> 09:36.680]  Look at that.
[09:36.800 --> 09:37.180]  Safe.
[09:37.180 --> 09:38.540]  Dude, I could have kept my rope in there.
[09:38.880 --> 09:39.180]  Yep.
[09:40.300 --> 09:41.880]  You get to play your baseball cards.
[09:42.080 --> 09:42.600]  One...
[09:42.600 --> 09:43.220]  One baseball.
[09:43.600 --> 09:44.120]  One...
[09:44.120 --> 09:45.020]  Dog...
[09:45.020 --> 09:45.280]  Uh...
[09:45.980 --> 09:46.500]  Uh...
[09:46.500 --> 09:47.120]  Tennis ball.
[09:47.620 --> 09:48.100]  And a hat.
[09:48.780 --> 09:51.460]  My favorite thing about the five in one is...
[09:51.460 --> 09:53.620]  It was so cool of an idea as a kid.
[09:53.960 --> 09:54.640]  But it was...
[09:54.640 --> 09:56.480]  Play these five games poorly.
[09:56.840 --> 09:58.360]  Like none of them worked very well.
[09:58.660 --> 09:58.880]  Yeah.
[09:58.880 --> 09:59.740]  They were all terrible.
[10:00.120 --> 10:00.240]  Yeah.
[10:00.380 --> 10:00.640]  They...
[10:00.640 --> 10:01.040]  They were...
[10:01.040 --> 10:01.740]  It was not good.
[10:02.060 --> 10:03.060]  Like the felt...
[10:03.060 --> 10:03.780]  For the...
[10:03.780 --> 10:05.140]  It wasn't even like felt...
[10:05.140 --> 10:06.120]  For the...
[10:06.120 --> 10:06.600]  Uh...
[10:06.600 --> 10:07.880]  The pool...
[10:07.880 --> 10:09.920]  And then the bowling never really rolled right.
[10:10.340 --> 10:10.740]  And...
[10:10.740 --> 10:11.800]  The basketball was fun.
[10:11.960 --> 10:14.040]  Because it was just a little thing that like launched a little ball.
[10:14.140 --> 10:14.640]  That was fun.
[10:15.520 --> 10:15.920]  So...
[10:15.920 --> 10:21.120]  Is this the first item that somebody from this podcast physically owned?
[10:21.480 --> 10:22.160]  That we've run into yet?
[10:22.180 --> 10:22.580]  Nick said...
[10:22.580 --> 10:23.620]  Nick said he had the...
[10:23.620 --> 10:23.900]  Oh!
[10:24.080 --> 10:24.260]  Right.
[10:24.320 --> 10:24.980]  You had the magic...
[10:24.980 --> 10:25.140]  Yeah.
[10:25.200 --> 10:26.660]  Some variation of that magic set.
[10:26.760 --> 10:29.640]  I believe that kid in the green shirt is Elon Musk.
[10:29.780 --> 10:30.640]  And that's where his...
[10:30.640 --> 10:31.200]  His Mars.
[10:31.420 --> 10:33.720]  I think if you were to read his lips, he's yelling Mars.
[10:34.920 --> 10:38.860]  I turned 23 in 1990.
[10:39.040 --> 10:40.960]  So you had to keep the hands off my stuff?
[10:41.320 --> 10:42.220]  So I...
[10:42.220 --> 10:43.700]  I don't know that I'm going to wreck...
[10:43.700 --> 10:46.300]  I don't know that I'm going to have any of these things other than the PlayStation.
[10:46.580 --> 10:47.380]  But we'll see.
[10:47.800 --> 10:48.220]  Okay.
[10:48.640 --> 10:49.460]  If you say so.
[10:50.660 --> 10:51.280]  Oh, man.
[10:52.220 --> 10:52.540]  Oh!
[10:52.920 --> 10:53.360]  Oh!
[10:53.760 --> 10:54.800]  You didn't have that truck, Geoff?
[10:55.080 --> 10:55.520]  I...
[10:55.520 --> 10:56.260]  I wish I did.
[10:56.620 --> 10:58.740]  You had the NASCAR golden car.
[10:58.960 --> 10:59.420]  Get real.
[10:59.800 --> 11:02.240]  Monday Night Football lighted stadium?
[11:02.240 --> 11:04.020]  I definitely didn't have that.
[11:04.020 --> 11:04.720]  No more fumbles.
[11:05.940 --> 11:07.120]  Cool haircuts, guys.
[11:07.440 --> 11:08.040]  What is it?
[11:08.100 --> 11:10.600]  It's just like the thing where it like rumbles and the things move?
[11:10.980 --> 11:12.000]  I think so.
[11:13.040 --> 11:14.020]  Where's John Madden?
[11:14.220 --> 11:14.380]  Yeah.
[11:14.860 --> 11:20.420]  No more fumbles in the night with the electric football stadium that really lights up the afternoon.
[11:22.380 --> 11:22.680]  Damn.
[11:22.880 --> 11:25.100]  Nick is excited about it now for some reason.
[11:25.560 --> 11:26.780]  I'm a child at heart.
[11:27.200 --> 11:28.120]  Realistic crowds.
[11:28.120 --> 11:32.960]  Well, the realistic crowd is just these two kids.
[11:35.520 --> 11:37.040]  And a golden NASCAR.
[11:37.480 --> 11:37.700]  Yeah.
[11:38.080 --> 11:41.100]  But it's Sears exclusive, so I can't imagine anyone has that, you know?
[11:41.820 --> 11:43.140]  No one has Sears anymore.
[11:43.900 --> 11:44.160]  Yeah.
[11:44.580 --> 11:46.860]  They bulldozed the Sears in Austin, I think, when they started.
[11:46.860 --> 11:47.460]  It's gone, baby.
[11:47.560 --> 11:48.180]  It's sad.
[11:48.680 --> 11:49.060]  Oh!
[11:49.220 --> 11:49.760]  Pup shot!
[11:50.420 --> 11:51.300]  Love those!
[11:52.640 --> 11:57.100]  I was always so jealous of the electric cars that you could actually drive around as a kid.
[11:57.220 --> 11:57.780]  That was...
[11:57.780 --> 11:59.020]  I never had one.
[11:59.040 --> 12:00.540]  And I just think it would have been great.
[12:00.900 --> 12:06.680]  Dude, I'm 48 years old and there's a little girl in our neighborhood who drives around in a Barbie dream car.
[12:06.840 --> 12:07.640]  And I'm fucking...
[12:07.640 --> 12:09.240]  I get annoyed and jealous when I see it.
[12:09.680 --> 12:12.280]  Yeah, people just like little kids driving around in G-wagons.
[12:14.120 --> 12:18.000]  With the release of Halo Infinite, they made a little Warthog electric one for kids.
[12:18.120 --> 12:19.420]  I've never wanted anything more.
[12:19.480 --> 12:20.160]  Oh, wow!
[12:20.320 --> 12:21.740]  Oh my god, I gotta get that for my kids.
[12:22.000 --> 12:22.380]  So cool.
[12:22.580 --> 12:23.440]  Oh, you need... yeah!
[12:23.560 --> 12:24.600]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:24.860 --> 12:26.200]  We're gonna live vicariously through my son.
[12:26.300 --> 12:26.700]  Let's do this.
[12:27.220 --> 12:28.300]  That sounds awesome.
[12:30.540 --> 12:31.540]  Oh, that's great.
[12:32.040 --> 12:35.360]  Hey, Andrew, do you think you would have benefited from those snowshoes up in Canada?
[12:35.740 --> 12:37.300]  I definitely would have.
[12:37.400 --> 12:41.380]  But I also would have been incredibly disappointed if that's the thing I got out of that page.
[12:42.720 --> 12:43.860]  What is the thing...
[12:43.860 --> 12:44.320]  How about this?
[12:44.340 --> 12:46.440]  What is the thing you want the least on this page?
[12:47.220 --> 12:48.020]  Oh, man.
[12:48.240 --> 12:48.620]  Okay.
[12:49.080 --> 12:49.660]  Let's see.
[12:49.700 --> 12:51.280]  Probably the dad clock, because it looks like dad.
[12:51.960 --> 12:53.220]  I think I would take the mom...
[12:53.220 --> 12:54.360]  I don't want the mom clock.
[12:55.160 --> 12:58.920]  I don't want whatever this package thing is at the bottom for birds.
[12:59.040 --> 12:59.620]  I don't care about...
[12:59.620 --> 13:01.560]  Yeah, I don't need to see nature's beauty.
[13:01.780 --> 13:02.320]  Yeah, I'm pretty...
[13:02.320 --> 13:04.780]  Well, it's where you keep the birds after you catch them.
[13:05.240 --> 13:08.180]  Yeah, but you've got the binoculars to perv on people, so that's cool.
[13:08.180 --> 13:09.080]  Yeah, that's true.
[13:09.360 --> 13:10.840]  So you can perv on the birds.
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.460]  But you can go fishing with your tackle box handheld game for Radica.
[13:16.220 --> 13:16.440]  Yeah.
[13:16.620 --> 13:18.240]  Oh, that looks great.
[13:18.560 --> 13:19.320]  Lunker Bass.
[13:19.400 --> 13:21.380]  Fishing for fun anywhere, anytime.
[13:21.380 --> 13:23.780]  Game of the year, Lunker Bass.
[13:23.780 --> 13:25.620]  Game of the year.
[13:25.680 --> 13:29.700]  Once they added microtransactions to Lunker Bass, it was never the same.
[13:29.800 --> 13:32.800]  Yeah, man, it's a real pay-to-win thing now. You just pay to catch the fish.
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.300]  Dude, fucking fish skins. It's ridiculous.
[13:36.560 --> 13:37.560]  Fish skins?
[13:40.560 --> 13:41.060]  What?
[13:41.160 --> 13:43.560]  Oh, I want that frog.
[13:43.920 --> 13:45.120]  What a monster.
[13:45.460 --> 13:46.100]  The bullfrog.
[13:46.100 --> 13:46.720]  What is that?
[13:47.780 --> 13:52.440]  I like that he's for some reason is also just wearing flip-flops.
[13:53.280 --> 13:56.700]  Like, why was that important to his outfit?
[13:57.180 --> 14:00.060]  He's got a t-shirt on. He's like a beach guy.
[14:00.440 --> 14:04.780]  He's got his fucking frog genitals out, but he's got his feet covered.
[14:05.000 --> 14:06.320]  He's got that frog hog out.
[14:08.520 --> 14:10.720]  He's covering it with his foot right now.
[14:12.480 --> 14:14.240]  What's this giant thing?
[14:15.180 --> 14:21.180]  Do you think if we called this number 1-800-775-5555, our dreams would come true?
[14:21.180 --> 14:22.060]  Should I call it?
[14:22.400 --> 14:23.200]  Yeah, call it.
[14:23.740 --> 14:24.720]  Someone call it.
[14:24.920 --> 14:25.680]  Alright, I'm calling it.
[14:25.700 --> 14:27.020]  Alright, where wishes come true.
[14:28.040 --> 14:30.220]  I'm gonna see if I can buy this bullfrog off eBay.
[14:33.980 --> 14:38.200]  The batter-up thing probably just does not... I mean, it's probably like little wiffle balls or whatever.
[14:38.740 --> 14:40.180]  FM radio, watch.
[14:40.380 --> 14:41.480]  Wait, I can't see the number.
[14:41.940 --> 14:44.600]  Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you'd already dialed it.
[14:45.320 --> 14:46.660]  No, I was about to go to the next page.
[14:48.560 --> 14:48.940]  Oh...
[14:50.860 --> 14:53.900]  Okay, I sent the warthog to my wife. Let's see what she says.
[14:59.000 --> 15:00.320]  Hell, you could've called Australia.
[15:03.880 --> 15:06.400]  You should hang up. I think you're on a list now.
[15:07.060 --> 15:08.960]  Well, we don't know what we're... who have we called?
[15:10.760 --> 15:11.800]  Some Australian woman.
[15:12.280 --> 15:14.160]  Does she have access to the bullfrog?
[15:14.820 --> 15:15.460]  I'll ask.
[15:15.900 --> 15:16.420]  Where's my frog?
[15:16.620 --> 15:16.980]  The frog?
[15:17.560 --> 15:17.960]  Bullfrog?
[15:18.260 --> 15:18.660]  Bullfrog.
[15:20.960 --> 15:24.140]  If they don't have that, see if they have the Hydro Zap still.
[15:25.720 --> 15:27.160]  Hi, can I have the bullfrog?
[15:31.500 --> 15:33.060]  That's Mr. Bullfrog to you.
[15:35.420 --> 15:36.980]  Can I have the bullfrog, please?
[15:40.160 --> 15:45.780]  Isn't it fucking weird how somehow in 2023 we can't even engage with spam?
[15:46.020 --> 15:47.440]  Like, they won't even let you...
[15:50.320 --> 15:54.340]  Well, he has the bullfrog and he won't give it to you. Andrew found one.
[15:54.560 --> 15:55.660]  I found $70.
[15:56.360 --> 15:57.300]  Oh my god!
[15:57.940 --> 15:58.980]  How much was it originally?
[16:00.260 --> 16:01.560]  Uh, $34.99.
[16:02.160 --> 16:04.660]  It was $34.99, so inflation calculate it, Nick.
[16:05.380 --> 16:07.440]  $34.99 is...
[16:08.900 --> 16:09.700]  $65.68.
[16:10.040 --> 16:11.100]  Oh, you're getting ripped off.
[16:11.380 --> 16:12.400]  You're getting ripped off.
[16:12.500 --> 16:13.620]  No, you're getting ripped off, dude.
[16:13.700 --> 16:14.260]  That's pretty close.
[16:14.540 --> 16:18.380]  I would send him a message and say I won't pay a dime over $65.58 or whatever.
[16:22.560 --> 16:23.140]  Hydro Zap?
[16:23.680 --> 16:27.300]  Yeah, I think it's like a quiz game and then it sprays you in the face.
[16:28.560 --> 16:30.960]  Oh my god, we have got to get that.
[16:31.680 --> 16:32.760]  Find a Hydro Zap.
[16:33.200 --> 16:33.600]  Hydro...
[16:34.720 --> 16:36.000]  Let's fill it with horseradish.
[16:36.320 --> 16:37.340]  Oh yeah, horseradish.
[16:38.800 --> 16:39.240]  Jesus.
[16:41.120 --> 16:41.960]  Hydro Zap.
[16:42.120 --> 16:42.820]  Stuff that stings.
[16:43.420 --> 16:48.600]  What if three of them are filled with that and then one of them is filled with piss and nobody gets to know it and they mix it up?
[16:49.380 --> 16:51.060]  Dude, you can buy a Hydro Zap for $20.
[16:51.660 --> 16:56.660]  What? How much? It's $19.99 with the inflation calculator, Nick. How much is that?
[16:58.000 --> 16:59.940]  Uh, let's find out.
[17:02.340 --> 17:03.220]  It is...
[17:03.220 --> 17:04.520]  $37.52.
[17:05.480 --> 17:07.060]  These things are really maintaining their value.
[17:07.060 --> 17:11.980]  It is new in box, I believe cheaper than what it was at that time.
[17:12.260 --> 17:14.240]  I have an eBay link for one.
[17:17.980 --> 17:21.940]  Remember when you were a kid and grown-up shampoo stung your eyes way more than kid shampoo?
[17:22.180 --> 17:22.400]  Yes.
[17:22.880 --> 17:24.460]  We should put grown-up shampoo in that thing.
[17:25.740 --> 17:27.140]  Grown-up shampoo.
[17:27.740 --> 17:28.800]  We've got to fill it with pert.
[17:29.560 --> 17:36.020]  Did you ever do the thing where you would walk through, like, the laundry soap aisle of the grocery store and it was, like, getting baby-maced?
[17:36.220 --> 17:37.860]  Like, it would burn your eyes.
[17:40.540 --> 17:42.480]  My sensitive newer eyes.
[17:45.140 --> 17:48.820]  I would avoid the cleaning supply aisle.
[17:50.500 --> 17:54.100]  Man, I'd be pissed if I bought that kid blue shit and now I'm looking at other drugs in it.
[17:54.100 --> 17:55.320]  There's more?
[17:56.000 --> 17:57.460]  Did you find out about page 7?
[17:58.680 --> 18:03.540]  Oh, I could have had a drum kit that said rock on it? What's this bullshit?
[18:05.860 --> 18:08.840]  Dude, that... the sharp, like, stereo?
[18:10.140 --> 18:12.800]  With the cassette? CD on the top, baby?
[18:13.600 --> 18:15.360]  You could record from one to the other.
[18:16.300 --> 18:19.920]  I guarantee you can detach those speakers, too, and move them around the room.
[18:20.480 --> 18:21.920]  Make copies for your friends.
[18:21.920 --> 18:29.120]  I can't articulate why it's so funny to me, but I think it's so fucking funny that on the drum set, it's bright red and then below it, blue.
[18:29.480 --> 18:31.200]  And then in brackets, not shown.
[18:34.280 --> 18:36.280]  Just in case you were wondering where that blue was.
[18:36.480 --> 18:38.280]  Where the fuck's the blue drum?
[18:41.180 --> 18:41.620]  Skip.
[18:42.200 --> 18:43.360]  So many baby stuff.
[18:43.960 --> 18:46.280]  Yeah, that's for... yeah, that page's for babies.
[18:46.320 --> 18:48.120]  Ah, this fuck packs a fun in.
[18:49.260 --> 18:49.600]  Yeah.
[18:50.260 --> 18:52.020]  Oh, this is for babies.
[18:52.920 --> 18:53.340]  Seeing.
[18:54.080 --> 18:54.860]  Get away.
[18:55.160 --> 18:55.680]  Oh, that's kind of cool.
[18:55.680 --> 18:57.540]  All right, well, the baby stuff's got... we get a little closer to...
[18:57.540 --> 18:58.460]  That's kind of cool.
[18:58.600 --> 19:00.360]  Yeah, we're getting into, like, Gavin territory.
[19:00.860 --> 19:02.900]  Gavin, let me know when any of this looks cool to you.
[19:03.260 --> 19:03.500]  Okay.
[19:03.880 --> 19:06.040]  Keep your eye out for the Toonyville choo-choo I'm looking.
[19:06.480 --> 19:06.580]  Yeah.
[19:06.700 --> 19:07.460]  Look at that Mickey!
[19:08.720 --> 19:10.660]  The Mickey license stuff's pretty cute.
[19:10.940 --> 19:11.240]  Yeah.
[19:12.200 --> 19:12.340]  Oh!
[19:13.020 --> 19:15.240]  You know, do you think any of the baby...
[19:15.240 --> 19:15.520]  Oh, there's this thing!
[19:16.160 --> 19:18.040]  There's the Toonyville choo-choo, holy shit!
[19:18.360 --> 19:18.620]  No, no!
[19:18.620 --> 19:19.360]  It's the choo-choo!
[19:19.480 --> 19:20.900]  Oh, my God, it's fucking right there!
[19:21.200 --> 19:23.080]  Oh, my God, it's the same fucking one!
[19:23.180 --> 19:25.720]  It's on my calendar, I'm looking at it right now!
[19:26.900 --> 19:29.200]  Holy shit, guys, it's identical!
[19:30.240 --> 19:30.920]  Oh, my God!
[19:31.000 --> 19:32.800]  I do have something from the catalog.
[19:34.960 --> 19:37.000]  He's got the Toonyville choo-choo.
[19:37.200 --> 19:40.700]  There's also the same thing, but, like, as a CD player.
[19:40.800 --> 19:41.400]  Like a CD player, yeah.
[19:41.400 --> 19:42.520]  But the trade is so much cooler.
[19:42.900 --> 19:43.100]  Yeah.
[19:43.260 --> 19:43.580]  I agree.
[19:44.800 --> 19:45.120]  Wow.
[19:47.820 --> 19:49.300]  Oh, I turned it on, how do I turn it off?
[19:49.480 --> 19:49.640]  Fuck!
[19:53.180 --> 19:54.220]  How the fuck do you...
[19:54.220 --> 19:55.460]  This is so immersive.
[19:56.620 --> 19:58.120]  How do I turn it off?!
[20:01.980 --> 20:03.860]  It doesn't even have the record in it!
[20:04.240 --> 20:05.120]  How can it still be...
[20:05.680 --> 20:06.280]  Ah, fuck!
[20:06.720 --> 20:09.240]  How do we go from starting a podcast to this moment?
[20:09.520 --> 20:10.500]  I don't know!
[20:10.920 --> 20:13.080]  I don't know how to turn...
[20:13.080 --> 20:14.180]  Just turn yourself off.
[20:14.180 --> 20:14.400]  Oh!
[20:15.080 --> 20:15.480]  Oh!
[20:15.920 --> 20:16.320]  Hold on.
[20:16.980 --> 20:17.740]  Alright, got it.
[20:17.940 --> 20:18.760]  I found that there was a...
[20:18.760 --> 20:25.140]  I love that the kids in G are looking like this is the greatest mystery anyone's ever had.
[20:25.480 --> 20:26.680]  It's just, they go down the...
[20:26.680 --> 20:26.800]  Shoot!
[20:26.940 --> 20:27.900]  The balls just go down.
[20:28.300 --> 20:29.580]  So I put them in there.
[20:31.100 --> 20:31.880]  And it's...
[20:31.880 --> 20:32.660]  You see...
[20:33.060 --> 20:33.760]  It's now...
[20:33.760 --> 20:35.380]  How did it get there?
[20:35.560 --> 20:36.720]  I put it in the white.
[20:36.900 --> 20:37.600]  How is it now in the green?
[20:37.600 --> 20:38.460]  I don't know what to tell you, Steve.
[20:38.540 --> 20:39.560]  I put the thing in the top.
[20:41.980 --> 20:42.680]  Oh, man.
[20:42.680 --> 20:45.180]  Geoff is so excited about his Toonieville choo-choo.
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.500]  Is that the same number that you called before, Gavin?
[20:48.600 --> 20:49.740]  The 1-800-775?
[20:50.060 --> 20:50.360]  Yes.
[20:50.640 --> 20:50.800]  Yeah.
[20:51.200 --> 20:51.640]  Okay.
[20:52.640 --> 20:55.640]  If someone else wants to try it, they might have better luck with the person.
[20:55.740 --> 20:57.020]  Oh my god!
[20:57.020 --> 20:57.940]  Oh my god!
[20:58.160 --> 20:59.960]  That went so long for me.
[21:00.420 --> 21:03.980]  I knocked everything off of my shelf putting that thing in the Toonieville choo-choo.
[21:07.360 --> 21:09.640]  I don't like that it says, uh-oh.
[21:10.640 --> 21:11.520]  Uh-oh!
[21:12.480 --> 21:13.820]  What is happening?
[21:14.120 --> 21:15.060]  Did you ever watch Teletubbies?
[21:15.740 --> 21:16.600]  Oh my god.
[21:16.740 --> 21:20.020]  I was too old for the Teletubbies. Me and Geoff were both too old for the Teletubbies.
[21:20.100 --> 21:21.140]  Yeah, we're a garnet.
[21:21.260 --> 21:28.780]  I'd like to see someone's catalog where they circled Tinky and Winky and Lala, but fuck Dipsy and Poe. I don't fuck with them.
[21:29.140 --> 21:29.920]  Fuck Poe.
[21:31.980 --> 21:32.840]  Anything here?
[21:33.320 --> 21:35.100]  Oh, speaking spells is shit.
[21:35.920 --> 21:36.800]  I Spy was fun.
[21:37.200 --> 21:38.380]  I had those I Spy books, yeah.
[21:38.720 --> 21:39.480]  Who says?
[21:39.960 --> 21:40.860]  Good night, moon!
[21:40.860 --> 21:41.560]  Game.
[21:41.860 --> 21:42.940]  Oh, there's a game?
[21:43.280 --> 21:43.940]  It's a game, so yeah.
[21:44.000 --> 21:44.400]  What?
[21:44.820 --> 21:45.380]  Wow!
[21:46.060 --> 21:46.960]  Say good night to the moon.
[21:47.320 --> 21:50.000]  It's probably beneath us.
[21:51.900 --> 21:52.860]  Beneath us!
[21:53.740 --> 21:54.040]  Oh!
[21:55.160 --> 21:55.860]  Well, people...
[21:56.380 --> 21:57.960]  Randy Newman hates this page.
[22:03.590 --> 22:07.360]  He hates this town, but he loves LA. It's fucking crazy.
[22:08.760 --> 22:09.640]  This is...
[22:09.640 --> 22:09.980]  Wow.
[22:10.180 --> 22:12.080]  This looks like what a doctor's office looks like.
[22:12.520 --> 22:14.460]  Is it like Playmobil? Or is it different?
[22:15.700 --> 22:16.140]  Different.
[22:16.420 --> 22:18.380]  It's Fisher Price. It's similar.
[22:18.980 --> 22:19.120]  Yeah.
[22:19.540 --> 22:20.940]  I think it's like the same kind of thing.
[22:21.100 --> 22:22.040]  Two sides of the same coin.
[22:22.640 --> 22:22.860]  Yeah.
[22:23.960 --> 22:24.400]  Okay.
[22:25.420 --> 22:30.540]  Like the Eeyore recently found out the Eeyore is the British way of saying hee-haw.
[22:31.080 --> 22:31.460]  What?
[22:31.920 --> 22:33.380]  Like a donkey noise.
[22:34.100 --> 22:34.640]  Yeah, Eeyore.
[22:35.060 --> 22:35.240]  Yeah.
[22:35.360 --> 22:35.840]  The sound of a donkey.
[22:36.280 --> 22:37.240]  Didn't know that.
[22:37.480 --> 22:37.720]  Oh!
[22:38.100 --> 22:43.220]  See, he's saying Eeyore, which is the sound of a donkey, which is not the sound of a donkey.
[22:43.440 --> 22:45.000]  The sound of a donkey is hee-haw.
[22:45.180 --> 22:45.740]  Hee-haw!
[22:46.020 --> 22:49.030]  But you say it with a British accent, and it's Eeyore.
[22:50.060 --> 22:52.860]  That is why Eeyore's name is that. Isn't that crazy? It's weird, right?
[22:52.900 --> 22:53.540]  That is crazy.
[22:53.640 --> 22:54.900]  No wonder he's sad all the time.
[22:55.300 --> 22:55.720]  No kidding.
[22:56.540 --> 22:58.560]  Dude, he's got interactive poo? Ew.
[22:58.800 --> 22:58.960]  What the fuck?
[22:58.960 --> 23:00.160]  Oh, Jesus! No!
[23:00.360 --> 23:00.840]  That's a...
[23:02.940 --> 23:04.740]  Picture of Andrew recording the podcast.
[23:04.740 --> 23:05.880]  Is that...
[23:07.040 --> 23:07.660]  That's accurate.
[23:08.280 --> 23:10.980]  That's $100 by interactive poo?
[23:11.560 --> 23:12.080]  Wow.
[23:13.180 --> 23:15.460]  I get you an interactive poo for $15.
[23:17.540 --> 23:20.500]  I can get you an interactive poo by this afternoon.
[23:20.780 --> 23:22.940]  That would cost you $187 today.
[23:23.640 --> 23:25.060]  Barney, I was too old for Barney.
[23:25.540 --> 23:26.560]  I was not a Barney guy.
[23:26.820 --> 23:27.060]  No.
[23:27.480 --> 23:29.100]  Millie wasn't either, I was so happy about it.
[23:29.860 --> 23:31.760]  We got the movie.
[23:32.120 --> 23:33.760]  Johnny Barney, Yellow Barney.
[23:34.420 --> 23:34.960]  Soundtrack.
[23:35.200 --> 23:35.960]  White Cat.
[23:36.540 --> 23:40.820]  Do you think any of the little child actors in this catalog are dead?
[23:41.720 --> 23:42.800]  Jesus Christ.
[23:42.940 --> 23:43.140]  Yeah.
[23:43.320 --> 23:44.720]  I thought you were going to say listeners of this podcast.
[23:45.160 --> 23:45.300]  Whispone!
[23:45.300 --> 23:46.080]  Oh, they do that too.
[23:46.440 --> 23:47.760]  If any of the ones are alive.
[23:48.080 --> 23:48.260]  Yeah.
[23:48.660 --> 23:49.480]  Oh, there's Babe.
[23:49.940 --> 23:51.380]  Hey, feed the dog.
[23:51.720 --> 23:52.920]  I love Whispone.
[23:54.240 --> 23:57.200]  I would argue that that's not a real live Babe.
[23:57.200 --> 23:58.740]  What do you mean?
[23:59.100 --> 23:59.840]  It's a real live Babe.
[24:00.180 --> 24:02.000]  I don't know about that.
[24:03.000 --> 24:04.560]  Yeah, that might be false advertising.
[24:05.240 --> 24:05.480]  No.
[24:05.760 --> 24:06.380]  I believe so.
[24:06.980 --> 24:11.460]  I don't think you can say real live anything and then have three batteries required.
[24:11.700 --> 24:12.660]  He does interactive.
[24:12.900 --> 24:13.540]  He does eating.
[24:13.740 --> 24:14.480]  He does sleeping.
[24:14.740 --> 24:15.340]  He does niggling.
[24:15.800 --> 24:16.200]  He does it all.
[24:16.200 --> 24:18.800]  At 6am, he asks for breakfast.
[24:19.160 --> 24:22.360]  At noon, he speaks of lunch and a midday nap.
[24:22.440 --> 24:24.620]  At 7pm, he asks for dinner.
[24:24.620 --> 24:27.840]  And after 9pm, he's too tired to talk anymore.
[24:27.900 --> 24:28.860]  Are you fucking serious?
[24:29.380 --> 24:29.540]  Wow.
[24:30.000 --> 24:31.200]  Speaks of lunch.
[24:31.460 --> 24:34.080]  So I do all those things, so I don't know what to feel anymore.
[24:34.280 --> 24:35.880]  This actually might be a real live Babe.
[24:36.000 --> 24:37.660]  Andrew is Babe picking the city.
[24:38.120 --> 24:38.300]  Wow.
[24:39.160 --> 24:41.020]  Can we make an interactive plush, Andrew?
[24:41.660 --> 24:42.940]  Oh, God, no.
[24:44.620 --> 24:45.420]  Oh, dude.
[24:45.680 --> 24:48.660]  I remember Pound Puppies when I was like really, really young.
[24:48.780 --> 24:49.520]  Pound Puppies were cool.
[24:50.140 --> 24:52.860]  I remember the name, but like nothing else about it.
[24:52.920 --> 24:53.900]  It was a cartoon.
[24:53.900 --> 24:55.220]  It was like adopting.
[24:55.500 --> 24:56.860]  You would like get a little dog.
[24:56.980 --> 24:59.560]  You'd adopt like a little dog or whatever, and then there was a cartoon.
[25:00.860 --> 25:01.180]  Okay.
[25:01.880 --> 25:02.900]  You would get like a little like...
[25:03.440 --> 25:07.240]  It was kind of like a cabbage patch kid that was more accessible to boys, I guess.
[25:07.320 --> 25:08.060]  You'd get like a little certificate.
[25:08.240 --> 25:09.820]  Like, you've adopted this dog from the past.
[25:09.820 --> 25:10.360]  Not really.
[25:10.820 --> 25:11.320]  Not really.
[25:11.980 --> 25:12.240]  Yep.
[25:13.460 --> 25:15.980]  But, you know, it might shut you up to your mom for a couple days.
[25:19.060 --> 25:21.400]  Some of this stuff just seems like generic.
[25:21.400 --> 25:23.600]  Like, Starbase set.
[25:26.060 --> 25:27.540]  Cinderella Dream Castle.
[25:28.060 --> 25:29.000]  Like, these are like...
[25:29.000 --> 25:34.440]  That was back when it was just about pure imagination and not like corporate branding and fucking synergy.
[25:34.960 --> 25:35.200]  Right.
[25:35.720 --> 25:37.020]  H is a little bit of a...
[25:37.020 --> 25:37.560]  Ooh, what was...
[25:37.560 --> 25:38.000]  Okay, hang on.
[25:38.120 --> 25:38.360]  Let me go back to H.
[25:38.360 --> 25:40.020]  It's like a minimum wage simulator.
[25:40.480 --> 25:41.300]  Yeah, pretty much.
[25:41.440 --> 25:41.660]  It's...
[25:41.660 --> 25:42.680]  Hey, you're going to be doing...
[25:42.680 --> 25:44.040]  It's fun now, but...
[25:44.040 --> 25:45.780]  Enough 15 years to see it.
[25:46.200 --> 25:48.260]  Oh, I thought it looked fun now.
[25:48.980 --> 25:49.580]  Oh, my God.
[25:51.540 --> 25:53.340]  Whoa, enter the secret code.
[25:53.680 --> 25:54.720]  Enter your secret code.
[25:54.840 --> 25:55.420]  What is it?
[25:55.620 --> 25:57.720]  Oh, it's a saving sound bank.
[25:58.580 --> 26:00.720]  You want to make saving sound fun?
[26:00.880 --> 26:02.060]  Secret code.
[26:02.780 --> 26:04.860]  Do you think parents are like, tell me your code?
[26:06.980 --> 26:08.220]  Where's the key?
[26:08.420 --> 26:09.840]  My first flashlight.
[26:10.700 --> 26:14.540]  You can just have a regular flashlight.
[26:15.820 --> 26:20.640]  Everybody always talks about their first flashlight, but do you remember your second flashlight?
[26:22.140 --> 26:23.080]  Nobody does.
[26:23.460 --> 26:23.680]  Nope.
[26:24.180 --> 26:25.640]  This flashlight is my flashlight.
[26:25.860 --> 26:27.560]  There are many like it, but this one is mine.
[26:33.160 --> 26:35.800]  Hello, fax me a drawing, please.
[26:37.160 --> 26:38.180]  What is this?
[26:38.180 --> 26:38.420]  Oh, man.
[26:39.360 --> 26:40.820]  Recording message center.
[26:41.160 --> 26:43.800]  It's like Cisco started making kids toys.
[26:47.020 --> 26:49.760]  Baby's first voiceover IP calling device.
[26:51.760 --> 26:52.640]  Teddy Ruxpin.
[26:53.120 --> 26:55.060]  Geoff, did you have Teddy Ruxpin?
[26:56.140 --> 26:57.700]  I knew of Teddy Ruxpin.
[26:57.760 --> 26:58.460]  I never owned one.
[26:59.300 --> 27:01.160]  Is this the origin of cars?
[27:02.140 --> 27:02.320]  What?
[27:02.360 --> 27:03.120]  I'm sorry, what?
[27:03.600 --> 27:05.360]  That Tonka truck with eyes.
[27:06.560 --> 27:09.380]  No, there has to be plenty of cars with eyes.
[27:09.380 --> 27:12.500]  Do you think that was the 1998 was when they invented eyes on cars?
[27:12.700 --> 27:14.540]  When was the first face put on a car?
[27:16.540 --> 27:18.320]  When was the first car invented?
[27:18.620 --> 27:19.420]  Yeah, no kidding.
[27:19.420 --> 27:22.640]  You think cars immediately had a face on?
[27:23.400 --> 27:26.320]  I don't think it took them 60 years to make the connection, no.
[27:26.580 --> 27:29.400]  I think we anthropomorphize those pretty quick.
[27:29.640 --> 27:30.660]  I think there was a lot of delay.
[27:31.420 --> 27:32.620]  I think it was pretty quick.
[27:34.780 --> 27:35.800]  Oh, here we go, Rugrats.
[27:35.860 --> 27:37.220]  Oh, fuck yeah, Rugrats.
[27:37.580 --> 27:39.400]  I don't know shit about this.
[27:39.600 --> 27:40.860]  Dude, Geoff, check it out.
[27:40.940 --> 27:42.660]  I can own all my favorite characters.
[27:42.660 --> 27:50.600]  Tommy, Phil and Lil, the grandparents, Angelica's mom and dad for some reason.
[27:50.960 --> 27:51.560]  Wow.
[27:51.980 --> 27:52.740]  What was the baby?
[27:53.340 --> 27:54.040]  I hate Dil.
[27:55.060 --> 27:55.260]  Dil?
[27:55.940 --> 28:00.320]  Does Rugrats, is that in Andrew and Gavin's era as well or just Eric?
[28:00.800 --> 28:01.360]  It's in mine.
[28:01.860 --> 28:03.420]  Yeah, I saw that Nickelodeon stuff.
[28:03.420 --> 28:10.980]  When this little kid is introduced, it's like I didn't watch anything with him.
[28:11.000 --> 28:12.340]  Yeah, that's like new Rugrats.
[28:12.340 --> 28:12.760]  Yeah.
[28:12.840 --> 28:13.680]  That was the movie, right?
[28:14.380 --> 28:14.500]  Yeah.
[28:15.140 --> 28:21.600]  When Rugrats first started, it was like, whoa, Nick Toons was like that and Doug and Ren
[28:21.600 --> 28:23.680]  and Stimpy and Rocko's Modern Life and everything.
[28:24.360 --> 28:27.080]  And it was like, oh, like this big block of stuff to watch.
[28:27.280 --> 28:31.900]  It's weird to see Doug look so well-defined and not like vibrating.
[28:32.540 --> 28:32.600]  Yeah.
[28:33.600 --> 28:34.520]  I'm not a big fan.
[28:35.120 --> 28:35.860]  I don't like it.
[28:36.400 --> 28:37.360]  Cool Reptar, though.
[28:37.740 --> 28:38.900]  Big, big Reptar guy.
[28:39.060 --> 28:40.180]  That's an awesome Reptar.
[28:40.460 --> 28:40.680]  Yeah.
[28:41.260 --> 28:43.220]  I completely missed all this Rugrats shit.
[28:43.240 --> 28:43.920]  Oh, yeah.
[28:44.260 --> 28:46.040]  I thought the art style was terrible.
[28:46.120 --> 28:46.420]  Yeah.
[28:46.900 --> 28:47.780]  Little bear.
[28:47.980 --> 28:48.560]  Little bear.
[28:50.700 --> 28:54.760]  What's, what's the, why is, why is he standing like a man at the bank?
[28:56.180 --> 28:58.580]  Sir, I have a check to cash.
[28:58.720 --> 28:59.440]  Have you noticed?
[28:59.540 --> 29:01.740]  He's standing like a man at the Fisher Price cash register.
[29:02.280 --> 29:05.220]  That every creature in this catalog needs a hug.
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.020]  He might rip you to pieces when you do it, though.
[29:09.020 --> 29:11.000]  Hug me like you'd hug a real bear.
[29:11.280 --> 29:12.940]  That's seen daily on Nick Jr.
[29:13.280 --> 29:13.720]  Daily.
[29:14.240 --> 29:18.300]  It's on every, and there he is, standing like a man at the bank, walking forward in the line.
[29:18.760 --> 29:19.140]  I don't...
[29:19.140 --> 29:21.300]  What is, what's happening at X?
[29:21.320 --> 29:23.660]  Is the head coming off the bear to put stuff in?
[29:24.360 --> 29:24.560]  What?
[29:24.800 --> 29:27.220]  Pick up pal da bear.
[29:27.560 --> 29:27.720]  Whoa.
[29:27.940 --> 29:31.840]  Oh, oh, it's like a little bin to, like, put your other crap in.
[29:32.720 --> 29:33.800]  And it's $25.
[29:34.460 --> 29:36.840]  It's a deep cylinder storage bin.
[29:37.920 --> 29:40.280]  Mom, mom, I gotta get the deep cylinder.
[29:43.200 --> 29:45.780]  VeggieTales, where's God when I'm scared?
[29:47.760 --> 29:49.220]  Well, you guys know that, right?
[29:49.360 --> 29:53.600]  VeggieTales was like Thinly Guy's religious past.
[29:53.960 --> 29:54.920]  Oh, I remember.
[29:55.860 --> 29:56.840]  It's just so funny.
[29:57.580 --> 29:58.340]  Where's God when I'm scared?
[29:58.380 --> 30:00.560]  Yo, where the fuck is God when I'm scared?
[30:00.640 --> 30:02.560]  I put on Fierce Fuck Christmas.
[30:02.620 --> 30:03.500]  Where's God then?
[30:03.700 --> 30:05.820]  Some buck-toothed zucchini's like, where's God?
[30:05.820 --> 30:06.400]  I'm afraid.
[30:08.540 --> 30:17.200]  What do you think the chances are that that little boy or that little girl right there holding the little cart was at the Capitol on January 6th?
[30:17.260 --> 30:17.960]  Oh, pretty good.
[30:18.420 --> 30:18.940]  I think so.
[30:19.040 --> 30:20.500]  Yeah, they made a lot of money out of this.
[30:20.820 --> 30:22.840]  I don't care about any of this stuff.
[30:23.200 --> 30:23.920]  No, it's so generic.
[30:23.940 --> 30:25.260]  I don't care about any of this stuff.
[30:26.160 --> 30:27.360]  Oh, the big comfy couch!
[30:27.700 --> 30:29.880]  Well, a blow-up couch is something.
[30:30.200 --> 30:30.640]  Wow!
[30:30.960 --> 30:31.580]  Is that inflatable?
[30:32.400 --> 30:33.580]  I might have a new chair.
[30:34.620 --> 30:35.960]  Let's see if you can find one.
[30:36.300 --> 30:36.820]  The big comfy couch inflatable.
[30:37.000 --> 30:37.880]  Let's see if we can get you one.
[30:37.960 --> 30:38.660]  Are you ready?
[30:38.980 --> 30:47.420]  Enjoy watching the PBS series The Big Comfy Couch from your very own heavy-duty inflatable couch.
[30:47.740 --> 30:48.720]  Oh, I would have loved that.
[30:48.760 --> 30:50.840]  Was that the first face on a couch?
[30:52.260 --> 30:53.640]  No cars did it.
[30:54.020 --> 30:58.080]  I'm pretty sure they improvised faces on couches pretty quickly.
[30:59.120 --> 31:00.480]  Big comfy couch.
[31:01.420 --> 31:02.420]  Are you ready?
[31:02.420 --> 31:03.900]  I don't see any.
[31:05.080 --> 31:07.760]  Are you ready to clown around?
[31:08.460 --> 31:12.800]  What's that behind there? Is it like some sort of little chick or is that the sun? What is that behind the couch?
[31:13.240 --> 31:13.640]  What? Where?
[31:13.880 --> 31:14.200]  Oh, that?
[31:14.600 --> 31:15.420]  Yeah, what is that?
[31:15.760 --> 31:16.980]  It looks like it's the sun?
[31:17.780 --> 31:18.960]  It looks like a chick, yeah.
[31:20.060 --> 31:22.640]  Dude, you can't buy one of those inflatable couches on eBay.
[31:23.040 --> 31:23.440]  No.
[31:23.540 --> 31:24.080]  I don't see one.
[31:24.620 --> 31:25.380]  Well, they've all rotted.
[31:25.740 --> 31:28.660]  Yeah, they're all in the trash and they're all decomposing.
[31:29.640 --> 31:30.800]  They're all biodegradable.
[31:30.800 --> 31:32.640]  Whoa, I love Thomas the Tank Engine.
[31:33.140 --> 31:34.240]  Oh, this is your thing, right, Gav?
[31:34.700 --> 31:36.420]  I don't care about this tank train at all.
[31:36.420 --> 31:37.600]  I think it's more Ringo Starr's thing.
[31:37.620 --> 31:39.860]  Radio-controlled chug-along Thomas?
[31:40.080 --> 31:41.400]  Only after George Carlin was done.
[31:42.920 --> 31:46.240]  Wasn't it a big deal in England, though? I mean, it's a British thing, right?
[31:46.720 --> 31:46.760]  Yeah.
[31:46.940 --> 31:49.220]  Did you grow up with Thomas the Train Engine?
[31:49.820 --> 31:59.660]  Yeah, there was an episode, though, where one of the carriages got crushed and his face fell off and a crane was holding his face and it scared the shit out of me and I never watched it again.
[32:00.800 --> 32:04.280]  Is this the thing that Sir Topham Hatt has a hand in somehow?
[32:04.560 --> 32:04.720]  What?
[32:06.160 --> 32:06.780]  The Fat Controller?
[32:06.820 --> 32:08.500]  Oh, yeah, the controller guy.
[32:09.940 --> 32:12.000]  I don't know what that is. I just know the name.
[32:12.400 --> 32:12.640]  He runs the trains.
[32:12.640 --> 32:14.760]  That's simply all I know of Thomas the Tank Engine.
[32:15.040 --> 32:19.300]  Were you a Percy or a James fan, Gavin?
[32:20.220 --> 32:22.060]  I think I was just a classic Thomas guy.
[32:22.160 --> 32:24.560]  Oh, no, he's a Gordon. You can fucking tell.
[32:25.140 --> 32:26.380]  Gordon was a bit stuck up.
[32:27.620 --> 32:28.980]  Gordon's a bit stuck up?
[32:29.140 --> 32:29.600]  He was.
[32:32.580 --> 32:32.980]  Well...
[32:32.980 --> 32:33.840]  Bye, Gordon.
[32:35.840 --> 32:36.640]  That's Andrew!
[32:37.640 --> 32:38.860]  He's riding a horse!
[32:38.980 --> 32:40.900]  That kid is cool.
[32:41.700 --> 32:43.940]  I don't fuck with horses, Eric. I don't trust them.
[32:45.060 --> 32:46.740]  But this is Marvel the Mustang.
[32:47.280 --> 32:49.260]  Yeah, I don't trust them. I don't like Marvel the Mustang.
[32:49.280 --> 32:50.600]  Have you ever...
[32:51.180 --> 32:53.220]  Have you ever been in front of a horse in person?
[32:53.840 --> 32:57.560]  Yeah, so I have a genuine, for a while, a real fear of horses.
[32:57.920 --> 33:00.800]  Because I went to a birthday party as, like, a four-year-old.
[33:01.120 --> 33:04.380]  And they did the thing where they had a horse and would, like, ride the kids around.
[33:04.580 --> 33:06.440]  And I was the last kid to do it.
[33:06.640 --> 33:09.160]  And the horse was tired and said, fuck that.
[33:09.440 --> 33:13.260]  So it took two steps forward and then tried to lay down with me on top of it.
[33:13.380 --> 33:18.400]  And I had to get ripped off of it while it was coming to the ground or else it would have crushed my leg.
[33:18.460 --> 33:21.140]  And I didn't fuck with horses for a long time. I was terrified.
[33:21.520 --> 33:22.160]  Didn't like horses.
[33:22.880 --> 33:27.280]  So, no, that's not me. I'm not fucking with Marvel the Mustang at that age. I don't trust them.
[33:27.940 --> 33:29.140]  Tic-tac-zoo.
[33:29.700 --> 33:32.660]  I was a big Theodore Tugboat fan, though. Loved him.
[33:33.400 --> 33:38.880]  We know, Eric, we know how to scare the shit out of these two guys with horses and Thomas the Train Engine, apparently.
[33:38.940 --> 33:42.800]  Yeah, we'll take a face off a horse and show it to both of them.
[33:43.240 --> 33:44.860]  For me, it was donkeys that scared me.
[33:45.520 --> 33:45.920]  Donkeys?
[33:46.620 --> 33:46.840]  Yeah.
[33:47.440 --> 33:51.780]  Yeah, I talked about how the first time I ever embraced death was on the back of a donkey.
[33:51.780 --> 33:52.600]  Didn't I tell that story?
[33:52.660 --> 33:53.240]  Jesus Christ, no.
[33:54.740 --> 33:56.920]  I don't think so, but that's pretty cool.
[33:57.040 --> 34:01.260]  I've only heard when the donkey was on your back in your first time embracing death.
[34:02.020 --> 34:04.920]  No, I was on the back of a donkey on a beach and it just took off with me on the back.
[34:05.040 --> 34:09.620]  And I was about five and I just thought, well, I can't hold on because I'm slipping off.
[34:10.820 --> 34:11.520]  This is it.
[34:11.800 --> 34:12.580]  And I just let go.
[34:12.940 --> 34:14.460]  I just let death take me.
[34:14.800 --> 34:14.860]  Oh my God.
[34:15.240 --> 34:17.380]  And I just bounced off the sand.
[34:17.600 --> 34:18.760]  But, you know, I was ready.
[34:19.880 --> 34:21.940]  I was ready.
[34:22.580 --> 34:22.920]  I just bounced off...
[34:22.920 --> 34:25.120]  I'd seen everything in the world I needed to see.
[34:25.360 --> 34:27.520]  I just thought, this is it.
[34:28.180 --> 34:28.860]  Oh, man.
[34:29.700 --> 34:30.940]  Okay, let's keep it going.
[34:31.460 --> 34:31.860]  Let's see.
[34:32.240 --> 34:34.020]  We're on page 38 of 490.
[34:35.040 --> 34:37.540]  Why is smoochy pooch?
[34:37.640 --> 34:38.820]  Why is this a thing?
[34:39.200 --> 34:39.740]  I don't know.
[34:40.320 --> 34:42.440]  Can we get to some of the older kid jokes?
[34:42.440 --> 34:43.700]  Yeah, we might be skipping through.
[34:44.920 --> 34:46.300]  We skip a couple pages.
[34:46.760 --> 34:48.980]  Let me see if I can find...
[34:48.980 --> 34:49.920]  Oh, what have you done?
[34:50.000 --> 34:51.080]  Do you want to skip through?
[34:51.260 --> 34:52.840]  Oh, no, go to the next page, Eric.
[34:53.080 --> 34:53.900]  Yeah, just go back.
[34:54.300 --> 34:54.580]  Why?
[34:55.340 --> 34:56.020]  Just go to the next page.
[34:56.240 --> 34:56.740]  Just trust me.
[34:57.020 --> 34:59.320]  Look at how fucking happy this kid is.
[34:59.460 --> 35:02.040]  This is the happiest I've ever seen anybody.
[35:03.160 --> 35:04.840]  That's a young Gavin at P.
[35:05.180 --> 35:06.300]  That's how he started.
[35:08.020 --> 35:09.340]  He's filming in slo-mo.
[35:09.580 --> 35:11.040]  He's filming in slo-mo.
[35:11.580 --> 35:12.260]  Oh, man.
[35:12.380 --> 35:13.840]  You gotta start with one frame a second.
[35:13.840 --> 35:16.740]  Perfection 35mm camera.
[35:17.320 --> 35:19.940]  There's a K is baby's first podcast kit.
[35:21.880 --> 35:23.100]  I had that too.
[35:23.820 --> 35:24.580]  Oh, man.
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.880]  So that would have had to have been an actual film camera, would it?
[35:28.780 --> 35:30.720]  Or is it just a bullshit thing that flashes?
[35:30.720 --> 35:33.040]  I think it's just a bullshit thing that flashes.
[35:33.300 --> 35:36.100]  I don't think there's film in it.
[35:36.600 --> 35:39.920]  Oh, you know what? It says 35mm film on the right.
[35:40.000 --> 35:40.980]  It might be real.
[35:41.180 --> 35:41.960]  That's a real camera?
[35:41.960 --> 35:43.100]  It might be fucking real.
[35:43.100 --> 35:44.640]  That might be a real.
[35:44.760 --> 35:45.440]  I'm looking this up.
[35:45.520 --> 35:46.000]  What is it called?
[35:46.220 --> 35:48.700]  If you can get that, we should do a photo shoot with that camera.
[35:50.500 --> 35:52.520]  35mm camera from Fisher-Price.
[35:52.880 --> 35:54.320]  I bet Wes already has one of these.
[35:54.500 --> 35:55.600]  Wes already has it.
[35:56.380 --> 35:56.480]  Price.
[35:58.020 --> 35:58.820]  Fisher-Price.
[36:00.420 --> 36:01.220]  Perfect shot.
[36:01.540 --> 36:04.240]  Nowadays, you gotta pay decent money to build a cage around your camera.
[36:07.080 --> 36:07.940]  Used to come included.
[36:08.020 --> 36:08.420]  No, I'm not.
[36:09.660 --> 36:11.440]  Oh, it's not that one.
[36:11.520 --> 36:13.000]  I found a yellow one on...
[36:13.000 --> 36:13.580]  Oh, here we go.
[36:13.860 --> 36:15.000]  Here we go.
[36:16.340 --> 36:17.400]  What's the inflation?
[36:17.640 --> 36:18.860]  So, how much was it back then?
[36:20.120 --> 36:21.000]  $34.99?
[36:21.800 --> 36:22.580]  $24.99.
[36:24.080 --> 36:24.520]  $45.
[36:25.440 --> 36:27.440]  I got a new in-box one.
[36:27.640 --> 36:28.400]  $46.91.
[36:29.360 --> 36:30.640]  I'm gonna put it in the chat.
[36:30.880 --> 36:35.600]  It's overpriced for what we want, but if we want to do a photo shoot, it's there.
[36:37.440 --> 36:38.120]  It's $90.
[36:38.740 --> 36:39.540]  Oh my god!
[36:39.540 --> 36:42.160]  That seems totally...
[36:42.160 --> 36:43.640]  It's a classic. It's from 1976.
[36:43.920 --> 36:44.920]  It's a classic.
[36:45.080 --> 36:45.920]  Or 1997, sorry.
[36:46.800 --> 36:47.760]  Did you say 1976?
[36:47.760 --> 36:50.040]  That fucking girl killed a lot of animals.
[36:50.340 --> 36:51.460]  She is so fucking...
[36:51.460 --> 36:52.700]  Look at my skins!
[36:54.440 --> 36:55.340]  It's like fucking...
[36:55.720 --> 36:55.960]  It's like...
[36:55.960 --> 36:56.940]  She's like Don Jr.
[36:57.280 --> 36:57.640]  God damn.
[37:03.200 --> 37:03.640]  Ertl!
[37:04.240 --> 37:05.820]  Oh, we got some John Deere happening?
[37:06.500 --> 37:07.400]  John Deere kids.
[37:07.460 --> 37:09.240]  They even have like their own logo.
[37:09.580 --> 37:10.400]  It's a smaller deer.
[37:10.820 --> 37:13.800]  I wonder how much of a business this is for John Deere and Ertl.
[37:13.800 --> 37:16.240]  Like how much money they make off of this kind of shit.
[37:16.340 --> 37:17.760]  Yeah, that's a great question.
[37:18.720 --> 37:31.760]  I wonder if they look at it as like every fucking plushy lawnmower or like little crane truck we sell is a future John Deere little customer 20 years later, you know?
[37:31.800 --> 37:34.460]  Like if they take a loss, but they're like brand loyalty.
[37:35.060 --> 37:37.740]  I wonder if they were against their kids repairing their tractors back then.
[37:42.380 --> 37:46.560]  Alright, Darla, you have your push mower and you don't have the right to repair.
[37:46.760 --> 37:48.890]  So if this breaks, you have to buy a new one.
[37:52.380 --> 37:54.480]  Oh, that air hockey table looks cool.
[37:54.820 --> 37:55.640]  That's about it.
[37:56.040 --> 37:57.200]  Everything else on this, whatever.
[37:57.200 --> 37:59.320]  Uh, yeah.
[38:01.160 --> 38:04.580]  That should be the regulation NBA basketball hoop.
[38:04.640 --> 38:06.680]  It should have a little pipe at the bottom of it.
[38:06.820 --> 38:08.340]  It shoots out.
[38:08.960 --> 38:10.440]  This is how Dream on Green practices.
[38:10.620 --> 38:11.160]  That's pretty cool.
[38:15.480 --> 38:18.960]  We are really deep into preschool shit.
[38:19.200 --> 38:22.140]  I need to get to the VR headsets.
[38:22.340 --> 38:23.600]  Okay, okay, okay.
[38:23.740 --> 38:24.220]  Okay, here we go.
[38:24.320 --> 38:25.040]  Look at this.
[38:25.140 --> 38:26.240]  We got some calculators.
[38:26.240 --> 38:27.640]  Now we're getting somewhere.
[38:27.760 --> 38:29.280]  Kids are, we're at homework age.
[38:29.400 --> 38:30.600]  Kids can do homework whiz.
[38:31.640 --> 38:32.720]  Rolodex electronics.
[38:33.360 --> 38:33.620]  Oh, yeah.
[38:33.700 --> 38:36.740]  Weren't those things called wizards for adults or something?
[38:36.860 --> 38:37.080]  Yeah.
[38:37.540 --> 38:40.440]  Yeah, kids speaking homework whiz and all that stuff.
[38:40.860 --> 38:43.200]  It was the, like knew that stuff.
[38:43.600 --> 38:45.260]  That's a stupid time.
[38:46.060 --> 38:47.040]  Discover PC.
[38:47.040 --> 38:54.420]  It's just, it's, it's weird because it's like this analog and digital sort of like overlap.
[38:54.420 --> 38:55.160]  Yeah.
[38:55.460 --> 38:57.720]  Where you don't really know what the future is going to be.
[38:57.840 --> 38:59.140]  So all your guesses are wrong.
[39:00.020 --> 39:02.400]  It's like my first crypto miner.
[39:03.420 --> 39:06.480]  And the future came so quickly.
[39:06.780 --> 39:09.080]  You get to see how wrong you were almost immediately.
[39:09.640 --> 39:11.280]  Power printer plus.
[39:11.720 --> 39:17.080]  Like the idea of this is something, but all of the execution of it is like such a mess.
[39:17.520 --> 39:19.320]  It's so fucked.
[39:19.320 --> 39:25.600]  When I was in the army early on and I would get sent to like Kuwait or wherever before this before laptops.
[39:25.860 --> 39:32.080]  They would send me with a word processing unit that looked almost exactly like the one that you just saw on the last page.
[39:32.480 --> 39:33.600]  Like almost in the middle.
[39:34.000 --> 39:34.280]  Identical.
[39:34.460 --> 39:34.620]  Yeah.
[39:34.740 --> 39:37.420]  With like the tiny little screen that you can see in the middle.
[39:37.740 --> 39:40.660]  Like just, I wrote, I used to fucking work off that thing.
[39:40.960 --> 39:41.360]  It's crazy.
[39:42.160 --> 39:44.480]  Did it come in a big briefcase or a pallet case for the army?
[39:45.580 --> 39:46.960]  It had some version of that.
[39:47.020 --> 39:47.160]  Yeah.
[39:47.500 --> 39:47.700]  Yeah.
[39:47.700 --> 39:49.260]  And then this is how Andrew typed.
[39:49.400 --> 39:52.700]  He was just hanging out with his frog, pressing his stomach, getting the letters in.
[39:52.980 --> 39:55.140]  Yeah, the caps lock key was on the right hand.
[39:57.900 --> 39:59.560]  That's the only important button to know.
[40:00.880 --> 40:01.240]  Oh.
[40:01.980 --> 40:03.120]  Get that IQ.
[40:03.660 --> 40:05.440]  Oh, word spin. I had one of those.
[40:05.760 --> 40:06.600]  You had a word spin?
[40:06.820 --> 40:07.700]  I had a word spin.
[40:07.800 --> 40:08.220]  I hate this stuff.
[40:08.700 --> 40:10.120]  I don't remember what you did with it.
[40:10.820 --> 40:12.480]  I think you spin words. Yeah.
[40:13.040 --> 40:15.260]  What's the game? Do you have to make words or do you just have to...
[40:15.260 --> 40:17.700]  I think you just make as many words as you can with spins.
[40:20.560 --> 40:21.000]  Countdowns.
[40:21.000 --> 40:21.340]  Oh.
[40:21.900 --> 40:22.320]  Five.
[40:23.660 --> 40:25.800]  There's so much dormant shit in my brain.
[40:26.100 --> 40:27.180]  Learning is so much fun.
[40:27.540 --> 40:27.980]  Bullshit.
[40:27.980 --> 40:30.180]  I love this fucking font.
[40:30.220 --> 40:31.620]  That font is fun.
[40:31.940 --> 40:32.620]  Word art font.
[40:33.300 --> 40:33.500]  Yeah.
[40:33.940 --> 40:37.140]  Look at, like, fucking baby's first expanding folder.
[40:37.380 --> 40:40.100]  It's like, do you want to organize your taxes?
[40:40.640 --> 40:44.620]  Oh, dad, I want to be like you. Can you teach me how to balance my checkbook?
[40:44.620 --> 40:46.460]  Where do I keep my receipts?
[40:46.540 --> 40:48.080]  Well, you're not going to learn it in school, so yeah.
[40:48.900 --> 40:52.860]  Do you think anyone who bought M the Billionaire's Club became a billionaire?
[40:53.180 --> 40:53.720]  Oh, absolutely.
[40:54.840 --> 40:55.240]  Yeah.
[40:55.560 --> 40:57.440]  That's what they look... this is how they dress, too.
[40:58.240 --> 40:59.800]  I love that they went with billionaire.
[41:00.360 --> 41:00.940]  Yeah, billionaire.
[41:01.280 --> 41:01.860]  Think big.
[41:02.420 --> 41:02.920]  Yeah, baby.
[41:04.040 --> 41:05.260]  You'd be a millionaire? Ugh.
[41:05.620 --> 41:06.300]  Ugh, loser.
[41:07.080 --> 41:07.380]  Lame.
[41:08.080 --> 41:08.300]  Lame.
[41:08.480 --> 41:10.420]  Who do you work for? I work for VTech.
[41:11.920 --> 41:12.720]  The equalizer.
[41:12.720 --> 41:13.960]  Oh, here we go.
[41:13.960 --> 41:15.740]  The affordable laptop.
[41:16.900 --> 41:17.300]  300.
[41:19.540 --> 41:20.340]  For what?
[41:20.700 --> 41:21.900]  Mouse on the left side.
[41:22.020 --> 41:23.880]  At least it's like not a DOS prompt.
[41:24.980 --> 41:29.800]  Well, what's funny is that this is a laptop that you can't connect to the internet to.
[41:29.900 --> 41:30.000]  Yeah.
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.660]  Like, it's all... it's great.
[41:32.760 --> 41:33.220]  It's just there.
[41:33.440 --> 41:37.680]  Also, M, the power zone, just looks like when you used to get too many pop-ups.
[41:37.820 --> 41:40.960]  I love their advertising, how annoying that's going to be to close all those.
[41:41.880 --> 41:44.420]  Why would you ever need to close something?
[41:45.180 --> 41:54.380]  The Canon BJC 255 bubble jet printer for VTech doesn't look that different from the Canon printer I could buy at Best Buy right now.
[41:54.380 --> 41:56.240]  Was bubble jet before inkjet?
[41:56.740 --> 41:56.960]  Yeah.
[41:58.460 --> 42:01.400]  Yeah, it went bubble, ink, and then... I don't know.
[42:02.140 --> 42:03.660]  And then I don't know.
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.680]  And then I stopped giving a shit about printing stuff.
[42:07.040 --> 42:07.960]  Bubbles sound cheaper.
[42:08.580 --> 42:11.300]  Oh my god, it's Barbie Elvis.
[42:11.320 --> 42:15.160]  Emily has this one, Emily has that one, Emily has this one, Emily has that one.
[42:15.680 --> 42:18.320]  How many peacocks did they kill for these Barbies?
[42:19.720 --> 42:23.020]  Look at the Elvis Presley TV. Look at him. TV special.
[42:24.260 --> 42:25.740]  1968 TV special.
[42:26.440 --> 42:30.680]  Every little girl's dream to have a 1968 Elvis doll in 1998.
[42:31.380 --> 42:34.080]  Uptown chic Barbie. Great.
[42:34.400 --> 42:35.300]  They loved Elvis then.
[42:35.840 --> 42:37.760]  This is cool.
[42:37.760 --> 42:38.520]  Barbie, Barbie.
[42:38.520 --> 42:43.120]  This is like Sopranos, Gumar, like, coat Barbie. That's pretty cool.
[42:43.940 --> 42:44.860]  That's awesome.
[42:45.900 --> 42:46.480]  Wow.
[42:46.960 --> 42:48.440]  Romeo and Juliet Barbie.
[42:48.960 --> 42:52.640]  Audrey Hepburn? That's just... just Audrey Hepburn.
[42:53.300 --> 42:55.100]  Ken has a fucking knife in his belt.
[42:55.520 --> 42:56.280]  Get him! Yeah!
[42:59.060 --> 43:01.080]  Draw down. Go, Ken, go.
[43:03.380 --> 43:04.540]  WNBA Barbie!
[43:05.080 --> 43:05.740]  Awesome!
[43:07.800 --> 43:09.220]  WNBA Barbie. Wow.
[43:09.440 --> 43:11.380]  Christy, Barbie, Teresa, and Kira.
[43:12.000 --> 43:15.980]  And they have NBA Bulls in the...
[43:17.320 --> 43:18.620]  Caucasian, not shown.
[43:18.900 --> 43:19.800]  What the fuck?
[43:20.360 --> 43:22.620]  Are these the cheerleaders? NBA commemorative?
[43:23.100 --> 43:24.560]  Bulls, Lakers, Knicks.
[43:24.780 --> 43:27.720]  And then University Barbie. They are. They're the cheerleaders, I think.
[43:28.500 --> 43:29.120]  How weird.
[43:29.280 --> 43:30.440]  No, here's Lakers Barbie.
[43:30.960 --> 43:31.340]  No Celtics, huh?
[43:31.540 --> 43:34.540]  I would have bought one of those if they made Celtics ones.
[43:34.540 --> 43:36.920]  Geoff, Alabama's on there. But not shown.
[43:37.080 --> 43:40.220]  I would consider getting a University of Alabama Barbie.
[43:40.420 --> 43:41.700]  University of Alabama, not shown.
[43:42.480 --> 43:44.180]  Oh, there's Texas! There's Texas!
[43:44.760 --> 43:46.480]  Do you know why it probably wasn't shown?
[43:46.880 --> 43:51.300]  In 1998, I think Alabama was still serving a suspension.
[43:51.860 --> 43:52.880]  Oh, awesome.
[43:52.900 --> 43:58.460]  I think that they almost got blackballed in, like, 94, and so they might not have been allowed to appear.
[44:01.580 --> 44:03.280]  More Barbies. Lots of Barbies.
[44:04.740 --> 44:06.380]  Tommy doesn't look well.
[44:06.620 --> 44:11.340]  Cool sitter, teen skipper. Teen skipper gets around, apparently, four times.
[44:11.780 --> 44:13.360]  No, she's a cool sitter.
[44:14.200 --> 44:16.460]  Oh, those aren't her kids.
[44:16.740 --> 44:18.360]  No, she's just simply watching for children.
[44:19.140 --> 44:21.920]  Wow! This is awesome!
[44:22.660 --> 44:22.800]  What?
[44:23.580 --> 44:29.000]  Barbie photo designer, digital camera, and CD-ROM. Now you can be in pictures with Barbie.
[44:29.260 --> 44:30.180]  Detective Barbie!
[44:30.660 --> 44:33.240]  They actually storyboarded the Barbie movie with that.
[44:33.620 --> 44:37.000]  I like that they called games CD-ROMs back then.
[44:37.320 --> 44:42.140]  I'm pretty sure Funhaus played this Barbie Riding Club game in a video.
[44:42.640 --> 44:44.920]  You mean the Barbie Riding Club CD-ROM?
[44:45.140 --> 44:47.440]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure they played that.
[44:47.900 --> 44:48.800]  Get it right, please.
[44:50.080 --> 44:50.840]  Yeah, of course.
[44:51.180 --> 44:54.040]  Cool looks, fashion designer. Cool looks, Barbie.
[44:54.440 --> 44:55.340]  Oh, a lot of Barbie.
[44:55.900 --> 44:58.840]  Wait, hang on. I'm sorry, I have to go back real quick.
[44:59.960 --> 45:01.380]  Software for girls.
[45:03.260 --> 45:04.100]  Jesus Christ.
[45:05.660 --> 45:07.480]  Alright, I guess I'll get fucked then.
[45:08.320 --> 45:09.560]  Software for girls.
[45:10.100 --> 45:11.260]  What if I want to be a detective?
[45:12.020 --> 45:12.800]  Oh, man.
[45:13.980 --> 45:17.000]  This is just... show Emily. Let Emily know about this.
[45:17.200 --> 45:18.380]  I will. I wish she was home right now.
[45:18.480 --> 45:19.300]  I'm going to show this to Amanda.
[45:20.360 --> 45:21.560]  Oh no, look out! Barbie horses!
[45:22.580 --> 45:24.600]  Dude, I recognize that Barbie motorhome.
[45:25.080 --> 45:25.400]  Great.
[45:25.620 --> 45:26.840]  I think Emily has that, maybe.
[45:28.840 --> 45:30.960]  I think there's a donkey. Barbie has like a donkey friend.
[45:32.120 --> 45:33.380]  Keep it away from Gavin, though.
[45:34.360 --> 45:36.040]  Wow, they really expanded Barbie.
[45:36.180 --> 45:37.680]  This is just not even Barbie stuff.
[45:38.500 --> 45:40.800]  Answering machine. Boombox. That boombox is cool.
[45:41.280 --> 45:42.860]  Conference phone. Great.
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.940]  Barbie CD player. The disc girl.
[45:46.540 --> 45:47.900]  Oh, that's so cute.
[45:48.140 --> 45:48.540]  Wow.
[45:49.900 --> 45:51.540]  I wonder if that was Barbie disc girl.
[45:51.780 --> 45:53.040]  $15? That's cheap.
[45:53.580 --> 45:54.340]  Oh no!
[45:55.900 --> 45:57.060]  That guy.
[45:57.240 --> 45:58.020]  Cat guys.
[45:58.880 --> 45:59.700]  I want this.
[46:00.120 --> 46:01.780]  Mouse guitar junior.
[46:02.860 --> 46:04.680]  Why is that the picture?
[46:05.300 --> 46:06.720]  I don't know.
[46:07.620 --> 46:11.120]  Maybe it's to warn people to keep this man away from their kids.
[46:11.540 --> 46:11.860]  Yeah.
[46:12.380 --> 46:13.380]  Have you seen this man?
[46:13.740 --> 46:15.900]  I don't like holiday hero Buzz Lightyear, either.
[46:16.140 --> 46:17.640]  He's a little too smug. Too shiny.
[46:18.280 --> 46:19.840]  He looks like DLC skin.
[46:20.200 --> 46:21.260]  He does, absolutely.
[46:23.700 --> 46:24.860]  Micro transaction.
[46:25.200 --> 46:26.380]  Oh, shit.
[46:27.160 --> 46:28.320]  Unauthorized biography.
[46:29.060 --> 46:32.360]  Was this everywhere just for you growing up, Gavin?
[46:33.080 --> 46:33.420]  Yeah.
[46:33.820 --> 46:35.460]  It was just inescapable, right?
[46:36.440 --> 46:39.180]  Is this before Ginger Spice left?
[46:39.300 --> 46:39.700]  I guess it is.
[46:39.880 --> 46:41.720]  This would be 98.
[46:42.460 --> 46:43.720]  Yeah, it's right before.
[46:44.060 --> 46:50.040]  How many times in your life, Eric, did you wish for a Spice Girl for Christmas?
[46:50.040 --> 46:54.580]  Santa, please. All I want for Christmas is any Spice Girl. I don't care which one.
[46:55.940 --> 46:57.000]  Like a toy?
[46:59.440 --> 47:01.700]  There's a lot of ambiguity in the way they said that.
[47:01.880 --> 47:03.800]  All I want for Christmas is a Spice Girl.
[47:04.440 --> 47:16.220]  But I'll settle for a Spice Girl's deluxe cosmetic set, a mousepad stationary set, pins and pencils, a pencil case, play shoes, a shoulder bag, a secret diary, and an electric organizer.
[47:16.480 --> 47:17.860]  I mean, I was a big Ginger Spice guy.
[47:17.860 --> 47:20.220]  Who's everybody's favorite Spice Girl?
[47:22.720 --> 47:24.320]  I like Sporty Spice.
[47:24.620 --> 47:25.600]  I think Baby.
[47:26.840 --> 47:27.580]  Sporty's cool.
[47:27.740 --> 47:29.140]  Nick? A bit of Bunton.
[47:29.520 --> 47:31.840]  I was a Sporty fan as well.
[47:32.260 --> 47:35.040]  Wow. Posh. In the mud.
[47:39.540 --> 47:40.980]  Oh no, Andrew, look away!
[47:44.600 --> 47:46.340]  Tell me when it's safe!
[47:46.340 --> 47:51.360]  This one's turning the corner. He was hiding behind the barrel and now he's coming for you.
[47:51.520 --> 47:54.360]  They're just selling a horse and an explosive barrel.
[47:55.340 --> 47:58.360]  Oh, I thought it said sniper next to barrel.
[48:00.180 --> 48:02.380]  Geoff, did you have Cabbage Patch when you were growing up?
[48:02.800 --> 48:03.060]  Nah.
[48:04.460 --> 48:09.020]  I thought they were weird and I didn't get the appeal.
[48:09.360 --> 48:10.620]  I thought they were weird.
[48:10.880 --> 48:15.160]  Also, to be honest, it was like girl stuff to me when I was a kid.
[48:15.160 --> 48:16.520]  Look, it's Babe again!
[48:17.220 --> 48:17.780]  Wow.
[48:19.320 --> 48:20.760]  Splash and shiver.
[48:22.420 --> 48:23.920]  Oh, Baby gets cold.
[48:24.580 --> 48:26.540]  Baby gets cold when you dunk it in cold water.
[48:28.120 --> 48:28.960]  Who'da thunk?
[48:30.480 --> 48:31.640]  Splash and shiver.
[48:32.460 --> 48:32.820]  Snoopy!
[48:34.100 --> 48:34.660]  Snoopy!
[48:35.280 --> 48:36.660]  He's everyone's best friend.
[48:37.500 --> 48:38.940]  This is not what Snoopy looks like.
[48:39.020 --> 48:39.580]  This is not.
[48:40.620 --> 48:43.880]  Also, Snoopy's traveling band would not be five different Snoopys.
[48:43.880 --> 48:45.940]  It would be Snoopy and his brothers and sister.
[48:46.360 --> 48:46.920]  Please grow up.
[48:47.360 --> 48:48.420]  But that pup is so real.
[48:48.560 --> 48:50.500]  I guess this is sort of what they're going for.
[48:51.640 --> 48:54.220]  There's an Olaf sort of situation here.
[48:54.700 --> 48:56.260]  This might be Belle.
[48:57.140 --> 48:57.700]  I don't know.
[48:57.800 --> 48:59.940]  Spike might be driving, but it doesn't look like Spike.
[49:00.420 --> 49:02.380]  So that really leaves Snoopy.
[49:03.220 --> 49:04.100]  Maybe Andy.
[49:05.420 --> 49:05.900]  I don't know.
[49:06.020 --> 49:09.480]  I don't think they were accurate with their portrayal of the Snoopys here.
[49:10.200 --> 49:11.060]  I'll take your word for it.
[49:13.060 --> 49:14.020]  Happy Meal!
[49:14.680 --> 49:15.160]  Fake McDonald's?
[49:16.440 --> 49:17.800]  This country's crazy.
[49:21.400 --> 49:26.240]  How are kids going to know to eat McDonald's when they grow up if you don't teach them as children?
[49:26.660 --> 49:27.140]  It's true.
[49:27.420 --> 49:27.740]  Yeah.
[49:28.640 --> 49:30.160]  What do you think about being a franchise owner?
[49:33.680 --> 49:35.280]  Where's the plastic melting pot?
[49:37.460 --> 49:38.580]  More Rugrats.
[49:39.500 --> 49:40.880]  Who the fuck is Annie?
[49:41.000 --> 49:42.780]  And why does she get a sun and fun camper?
[49:43.100 --> 49:45.220]  Why am I supposed to buy into Annie's bullshit?
[49:45.480 --> 49:46.380]  I'm already into Barbie.
[49:46.480 --> 49:47.620]  Now I gotta like Annie too?
[49:48.980 --> 49:49.480]  I think, you know.
[49:51.620 --> 49:52.420]  More Barbie.
[49:53.220 --> 49:55.100]  Emily probably had a bunch of this stuff.
[49:55.940 --> 49:57.400]  Wow, a $7 rebate!
[49:57.860 --> 49:58.220]  Alright.
[49:58.700 --> 50:01.640]  I remember that Barbie styling head being a big deal.
[50:01.920 --> 50:02.460]  Oh yeah.
[50:02.860 --> 50:04.080]  Is that how Emily got her start?
[50:04.340 --> 50:05.180]  Yeah, I think so.
[50:06.460 --> 50:08.820]  She worked on one of those for the first two years she was in school.
[50:10.800 --> 50:12.180]  That hair doesn't grow back though.
[50:12.420 --> 50:14.460]  What is Looney Tunes down here?
[50:14.660 --> 50:15.380]  Is it all Looney?
[50:15.520 --> 50:17.980]  They just keep throwing the same logo on it?
[50:18.340 --> 50:18.960]  Is that all this is?
[50:19.220 --> 50:20.720]  I think so.
[50:21.160 --> 50:23.180]  It's like things we could fit a logo on.
[50:24.700 --> 50:26.180]  Put Taz on it, idiot.
[50:26.540 --> 50:26.660]  Alright.
[50:27.480 --> 50:28.540]  That gear organizer.
[50:29.240 --> 50:29.500]  Yeah.
[50:30.880 --> 50:33.460]  I like this. This is a cool dog, but nothing's happening here.
[50:33.460 --> 50:35.800]  There's a dog right there that is really grabbing me.
[50:35.900 --> 50:36.540]  Oh, that dog's dead.
[50:36.620 --> 50:37.480]  Musical keyboard.
[50:38.060 --> 50:41.020]  Got the shoes and shoe box if you want to...
[50:41.020 --> 50:41.500]  Oh, great.
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.760]  Oh wow, for Christmas I want somewhere to keep my shoes.
[50:44.960 --> 50:45.820]  All your jellies.
[50:46.440 --> 50:47.320]  Garden house!
[50:48.620 --> 50:50.520]  Super activity set.
[50:51.980 --> 50:53.620]  Man, this is a Barbie heavy catalog.
[50:54.020 --> 50:55.340]  Well, it's very Barbie heavy.
[50:56.100 --> 50:56.860]  What do you expect?
[50:57.460 --> 50:57.960]  Here we go.
[50:58.140 --> 51:00.180]  I was hoping for G.I. Joe or Transformers at some point.
[51:00.180 --> 51:01.240]  This is Megamike.
[51:01.680 --> 51:03.600]  Whoa! Baskin Robbins!
[51:04.480 --> 51:08.120]  Nick has found his niche here, which is just the food things.
[51:08.980 --> 51:09.220]  Oh.
[51:09.620 --> 51:11.360]  I guess that is kind of my thing, huh?
[51:12.780 --> 51:13.840]  You can make ice cream.
[51:13.920 --> 51:14.480]  You can make cookies.
[51:14.780 --> 51:18.680]  You can make a 59-piece cake baking and decorating set.
[51:19.000 --> 51:19.740]  Oh, shit.
[51:19.740 --> 51:21.180]  Or a 109-piece.
[51:21.280 --> 51:22.140]  There's 109.
[51:22.900 --> 51:23.420]  $30.
[51:24.300 --> 51:25.560]  How much is that today?
[51:25.560 --> 51:27.020]  Let's find out.
[51:27.140 --> 51:28.140]  That's crazy.
[51:28.660 --> 51:28.820]  $55.
[51:30.320 --> 51:30.840]  $56.
[51:33.280 --> 51:37.900]  Dream Garden Giggle and Grow Nursery is fucking terrifying looking.
[51:37.920 --> 51:39.380]  Yeah, it looks like it's going to eat you.
[51:39.400 --> 51:40.480]  That's a nightmare.
[51:41.080 --> 51:42.400]  Giggle and Grow.
[51:43.340 --> 51:45.560]  Whoa, what's Taz doing down here, though?
[51:46.660 --> 51:48.000]  He's Eat Your Laundry.
[51:48.320 --> 51:48.920]  Dude, hell yeah.
[51:49.080 --> 51:50.300]  He's a Hooper hamper.
[51:50.700 --> 51:51.200]  That's awesome.
[51:51.200 --> 51:53.620]  Also, the Dream Garden
[51:53.620 --> 51:55.200]  Strawberry Sunshine Baby
[51:55.200 --> 51:55.960]  is terrifying.
[51:56.080 --> 51:57.200]  Oh my god.
[51:58.540 --> 52:00.040]  Pick me up or die!
[52:01.140 --> 52:02.040]  Giggle and Grow.
[52:03.300 --> 52:04.540]  Dog shit there.
[52:05.240 --> 52:07.820]  Giggle and Grow.
[52:08.500 --> 52:09.560]  Zap, zap,
[52:09.720 --> 52:10.500]  racetrack.
[52:10.660 --> 52:12.620]  Is this what you think the...
[52:13.680 --> 52:14.800]  Fun Noodle?
[52:15.260 --> 52:17.060]  Well, Andrew, the thing at the bottom,
[52:17.180 --> 52:19.080]  is this what you think the...
[52:19.080 --> 52:21.000]  What was the...
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.860]  The leg crossing thing that you have to run back and forth?
[52:24.640 --> 52:25.360]  Sewing machine?
[52:25.680 --> 52:26.760]  Yeah, is that what this is?
[52:27.520 --> 52:27.860]  No.
[52:28.620 --> 52:29.800]  Looks nothing like it.
[52:30.260 --> 52:33.260]  Could you do the sewing machine on the Fun Noodle Tumble Fun Mat?
[52:33.720 --> 52:34.460]  No, you couldn't.
[52:34.520 --> 52:36.740]  Well, I mean, you could do the move, but it would be pointless.
[52:37.500 --> 52:39.120]  It wouldn't show any of your agility off.
[52:39.160 --> 52:41.360]  You need a ladder. You need a ladder on the floor to do it.
[52:41.560 --> 52:41.940]  Oh, okay.
[52:42.980 --> 52:43.840]  If you say so.
[52:44.980 --> 52:45.760]  Hug a bear.
[52:45.760 --> 52:48.760]  Do you think, Andrew, you'd be a little less scared at night
[52:48.760 --> 52:50.460]  if you had a hug-a-bear nightlighter?
[52:50.960 --> 52:53.040]  Oh, I would have been way less scared at night, yeah.
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.520]  Bad life advice, though, in a general sense,
[52:56.580 --> 52:57.860]  but for sleeping at night,
[52:57.940 --> 52:58.640]  would have helped.
[52:59.960 --> 53:01.680]  Nightlighter makes it seem like you can actually
[53:01.680 --> 53:02.860]  light a match with it, though.
[53:03.220 --> 53:03.580]  Yeah.
[53:05.300 --> 53:06.240]  Which is pretty cool.
[53:06.740 --> 53:09.460]  You'll be less scared if you go to sleep with open flame.
[53:10.840 --> 53:11.700]  Save me, fire!
[53:13.380 --> 53:14.780]  Oh, easy pick-up.
[53:14.780 --> 53:17.260]  That's cool. Don't mix up the stuff on the top
[53:17.260 --> 53:18.140]  with the stuff on the bottom.
[53:19.260 --> 53:20.800]  Some is food, some is Play-Doh.
[53:20.820 --> 53:22.780]  That McDonald's Play-Doh looks real good.
[53:23.400 --> 53:23.500]  Uh-oh.
[53:24.060 --> 53:25.400]  And Play-Doh tastes like shit.
[53:25.700 --> 53:27.260]  Oh, Snoopy.
[53:27.680 --> 53:30.580]  So the Snoopy snow cone machine, they just re-released
[53:30.580 --> 53:31.660]  at Knott's Berry Farm.
[53:32.720 --> 53:35.440]  And you can get a Snoopy snow cone machine.
[53:35.580 --> 53:37.040]  They're selling it for Christmas.
[53:37.320 --> 53:37.780]  Let's go.
[53:38.280 --> 53:40.960]  I feel like we should have one of those to make snow cones.
[53:41.280 --> 53:42.380]  A Snoopy snow cone machine?
[53:42.380 --> 53:43.180]  I own one.
[53:43.680 --> 53:44.420]  Do you really?
[53:44.920 --> 53:47.580]  I do, yeah. I bought one at a thrift store.
[53:48.060 --> 53:49.180]  Two years ago.
[53:50.220 --> 53:51.560]  It does work, but not well.
[53:51.820 --> 53:52.560]  But it does work.
[53:52.840 --> 53:54.800]  I don't think it worked well when it was new.
[53:57.580 --> 53:59.800]  I never understood
[54:00.760 --> 54:01.880]  Anne of Green Gables.
[54:02.440 --> 54:04.100]  I didn't get the fandom.
[54:05.800 --> 54:08.060]  Wooden bed as a mattress, a pillow,
[54:08.480 --> 54:10.020]  a quilt-like bedspread.
[54:10.020 --> 54:10.520]  Bed.
[54:10.520 --> 54:10.720]  Bed.
[54:13.180 --> 54:14.060]  Fits doll.
[54:16.160 --> 54:17.220]  Bed. Fits doll.
[54:17.500 --> 54:18.000]  Not you.
[54:21.580 --> 54:24.580]  Little Tikes is just Fisher Price under a different name.
[54:24.900 --> 54:26.040]  I also feel like
[54:26.040 --> 54:26.940]  all this shit,
[54:27.340 --> 54:30.340]  kids this age would be too young to fully enjoy
[54:30.340 --> 54:32.000]  and understand this catalog.
[54:32.320 --> 54:32.660]  You gotta.
[54:34.140 --> 54:35.260]  This is...
[54:35.260 --> 54:36.100]  Oh, you can be a vet.
[54:36.100 --> 54:38.520]  It can't be for the parents
[54:38.520 --> 54:40.320]  because as a parent, I know
[54:40.320 --> 54:42.400]  when your kid is this age, you either buy
[54:42.400 --> 54:44.540]  what they point at on the TV
[54:44.540 --> 54:46.580]  or you just go ten minutes
[54:46.580 --> 54:48.240]  before, like the night before,
[54:48.340 --> 54:49.860]  and go, ah, fuck, and you run to Target
[54:49.860 --> 54:50.820]  and you just buy what's there.
[54:50.940 --> 54:53.520]  And you're like, ah, she's two, she's not gonna care.
[54:54.320 --> 54:55.060]  Also true.
[54:55.660 --> 54:57.240]  I loved the Light Bright as a kid.
[54:57.740 --> 54:58.780]  I never had one.
[54:59.320 --> 55:00.320]  That kid's sitting on a toilet.
[55:00.420 --> 55:03.700]  I have a Singer sewing machine.
[55:04.460 --> 55:05.520]  So, and they don't
[55:05.520 --> 55:06.180]  look like this.
[55:08.520 --> 55:09.480]  Interesting that Singer
[55:09.480 --> 55:11.100]  made, like, toy sewing machines.
[55:12.620 --> 55:13.360]  I wonder,
[55:13.600 --> 55:15.600]  did it actually sew? It has the foot
[55:15.600 --> 55:16.640]  control, the tension dial.
[55:17.100 --> 55:18.940]  It seems like it's a sewing machine.
[55:19.440 --> 55:21.580]  I thought it had a needle that could do that.
[55:22.540 --> 55:23.260]  And accessories.
[55:23.520 --> 55:25.060]  Needle, bobbin, and spool of thread.
[55:25.360 --> 55:27.300]  But was the needle a needle or was it a piece of plastic?
[55:27.480 --> 55:29.500]  I have no idea. Like, it just seems
[55:29.500 --> 55:31.580]  very weird that this is made
[55:31.580 --> 55:33.420]  at all. It's not gonna come with an
[55:33.420 --> 55:35.340]  AC adapter if it's not a real
[55:35.340 --> 55:36.520]  fucking sewing machine.
[55:36.920 --> 55:39.480]  AC adapter there, under G.
[55:39.760 --> 55:40.800]  You can get the AC adapter.
[55:42.820 --> 55:43.340]  Weird.
[55:43.980 --> 55:44.740]  Very weird.
[55:46.240 --> 55:46.840]  Oh, here we go.
[55:47.320 --> 55:48.220]  Got a friend in me.
[55:49.800 --> 55:51.060]  A girl across the street
[55:51.580 --> 55:53.560]  had this, where you put beads
[55:53.560 --> 55:55.100]  in their hair. She loved it.
[55:56.440 --> 55:56.960]  Electronic
[55:57.580 --> 55:59.460]  talking room guard Buzz Lightyear
[55:59.460 --> 56:01.500]  and Woody? Motion sensor
[56:01.500 --> 56:03.020]  activates security alarm.
[56:03.380 --> 56:05.360]  Each comes with secret passcode.
[56:05.580 --> 56:07.100]  Memory detects if correct code
[56:07.100 --> 56:09.260]  entered and gives friendly greeting or
[56:09.260 --> 56:11.500]  intruder alert. That is
[56:11.500 --> 56:13.400]  like a thing you'd read as a kid and be like, that's so
[56:13.400 --> 56:15.360]  fucking cool and then you'd get it and it's just
[56:15.360 --> 56:17.360]  useless. There's no point of it.
[56:17.400 --> 56:17.880]  It does nothing.
[56:19.220 --> 56:21.440]  My mom would go to do the laundry
[56:21.440 --> 56:23.500]  and then she would go, what? This thing won't shut
[56:23.500 --> 56:23.800]  up.
[56:27.580 --> 56:27.980]  Teddy
[56:29.140 --> 56:29.940]  Warmheart?
[56:30.920 --> 56:31.940]  Put the
[56:31.940 --> 56:33.760]  teddy in a sleeping bag
[56:33.760 --> 56:36.060]  and microwave for one minute.
[56:36.440 --> 56:38.400]  He'll stay warm for four hours.
[56:38.540 --> 56:39.580]  Talk about a night lighter.
[56:40.340 --> 56:40.800]  Wow.
[56:42.540 --> 56:43.640]  That's awesome.
[56:44.000 --> 56:44.780]  That's awful.
[56:45.680 --> 56:46.900]  I want that.
[56:47.800 --> 56:49.380]  Lion King. Wow.
[56:49.860 --> 56:51.820]  That mother goose
[56:51.820 --> 56:52.860]  is terrible.
[56:55.560 --> 56:57.220]  A cat named Bob.
[56:58.460 --> 56:59.680]  Mungos? What is this?
[57:00.160 --> 57:01.460]  Mungos World Tour?
[57:06.360 --> 57:07.660]  And then we got a bunch of
[57:07.660 --> 57:08.760]  Lion King stuff down here.
[57:12.440 --> 57:13.960]  I just got a news
[57:13.960 --> 57:15.900]  alert. I just got a news alert that says
[57:15.900 --> 57:17.640]  dead longhorn found
[57:18.260 --> 57:19.940]  at Oklahoma State
[57:19.940 --> 57:21.520]  Frat House one day before
[57:21.520 --> 57:22.900]  School Faces Texas.
[57:22.900 --> 57:25.180]  Do you think they mean
[57:25.600 --> 57:26.680]  the animal?
[57:26.940 --> 57:28.080]  I think so.
[57:29.320 --> 57:31.540]  Hopefully somebody called in with their
[57:31.540 --> 57:32.380]  Crayola phone.
[57:35.940 --> 57:37.540]  What is
[57:37.540 --> 57:38.460]  Naval Command?
[57:38.920 --> 57:40.220]  Night Chopper.
[57:41.680 --> 57:42.880]  Creature Seekers.
[57:43.360 --> 57:45.680]  Night Chopper has serious air wolf vibes.
[57:46.020 --> 57:46.500]  Yeah.
[57:46.500 --> 57:48.540]  I want to be this
[57:48.540 --> 57:50.200]  kid in H with the sunglasses
[57:50.200 --> 57:51.140]  and his backpack.
[57:51.700 --> 57:52.740]  Plastic backpack.
[57:56.300 --> 57:57.960]  A horse! Oh no!
[57:58.200 --> 58:00.460]  I prefer zebras when I ride.
[58:02.340 --> 58:04.540]  What the fuck is going on
[58:04.540 --> 58:05.240]  with that woody?
[58:05.720 --> 58:07.380]  That woody looks so...
[58:07.380 --> 58:09.420]  What is happening with his head?
[58:09.960 --> 58:11.740]  There's a snake in my brain.
[58:12.140 --> 58:14.140]  Tumbling talking woody looks
[58:14.140 --> 58:16.300]  terrible. There's a snake in my
[58:16.300 --> 58:16.920]  brain.
[58:23.800 --> 58:25.660]  Oh wow. It's almost
[58:25.660 --> 58:26.240]  Legos.
[58:27.460 --> 58:29.300]  I could get behind this. I used to get
[58:29.300 --> 58:31.360]  this kind of stuff. Really? Yeah.
[58:32.020 --> 58:33.700]  Like the not Lego
[58:33.700 --> 58:35.380]  stuff? Yeah, sure. Why not?
[58:35.540 --> 58:36.880]  It's a little bigger and chunkier.
[58:37.640 --> 58:38.920]  Like Duplos, Mega Bloks.
[58:39.540 --> 58:41.640]  I had the castle in the last page.
[58:41.760 --> 58:42.460]  In the last page? Oh really?
[58:42.460 --> 58:44.540]  Dude, that forklift was fucking
[58:44.540 --> 58:45.780]  cool. I had that.
[58:46.640 --> 58:47.560]  Could he lift up his parents?
[58:49.080 --> 58:50.780]  Could he lift up his parents?
[58:53.580 --> 58:54.280]  That dude that
[58:54.280 --> 58:55.880]  Geoff used to hang out with back in school.
[58:56.040 --> 58:56.540]  Could he use that?
[58:59.540 --> 59:00.340]  The great
[59:00.340 --> 59:00.840]  outdoors?
[59:02.680 --> 59:03.500]  Could you imagine
[59:03.980 --> 59:06.000]  your kid saying they want a patio
[59:06.000 --> 59:07.180]  table? Yeah, right.
[59:08.020 --> 59:10.240]  I want a bench! I want to enjoy
[59:10.240 --> 59:12.040]  a brunch with my friends on the veranda,
[59:12.040 --> 59:12.400]  mother.
[59:14.160 --> 59:16.060]  Dad, I need a place to store
[59:16.060 --> 59:18.140]  my toys. I don't want to leave them all out
[59:18.140 --> 59:20.080]  on the floor where you can step on them.
[59:20.160 --> 59:22.100]  Can I have a two-in-one toy box so I
[59:22.100 --> 59:23.220]  can put stuff away?
[59:24.240 --> 59:25.820]  If that was said to me, yes!
[59:25.900 --> 59:26.900]  Yes, you can, son!
[59:28.700 --> 59:29.960]  Now, here's the thing.
[59:30.240 --> 59:32.120]  This is what I remember from the 90s
[59:32.120 --> 59:32.900]  which was
[59:34.660 --> 59:35.540]  poorly licensed
[59:36.140 --> 59:38.300]  poorly produced licensed things.
[59:38.820 --> 59:40.340]  Batman on some stuff.
[59:40.340 --> 59:41.980]  Looney Tunes on some stuff.
[59:42.160 --> 59:43.660]  Barbie on some stuff.
[59:43.980 --> 59:45.280]  Rugrats on some stuff.
[59:47.220 --> 59:48.580]  That's what I remember.
[59:48.820 --> 59:49.820]  So crinkly shit.
[59:50.220 --> 59:52.380]  I'm not mad at that Batman
[59:53.080 --> 59:53.960]  set at all.
[59:54.360 --> 59:56.340]  But also, you can tell that this was scanned
[59:56.340 --> 59:58.140]  in because somebody X'd the Batman.
[59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.400]  I was going to say, there was one or two
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.540]  other ones on other pages that we'd seen that also.
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.380]  And it's like, oh, they must have wanted that.
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:05.840]  101 Dalmatians.
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:06.900]  On some stuff.
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:08.820]  Alright, here's a question.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.140]  On this page alone, you've got to
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:12.040]  choose between...
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.000]  You've got to choose between
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.180]  Dalmatians, Mickey,
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.240]  and Pooh Bear. Who are you picking?
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:22.520]  Probably Mickey.
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.100]  I'm going Pooh.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.840]  I want the tree stump Pooh.
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:27.260]  I'm going Pooh Bear.
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:30.800]  I'm going Mickey too because it looks like
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.580]  Donald Duck is on it as well.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.860]  Yeah, yeah, he's down there
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:36.500]  doing construction with Pluto and Goofy.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:38.480]  They're not
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:40.820]  super well versed at what they're doing
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:42.720]  here, but they're trying.
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:44.820]  And I think that's great. The rabbit's house
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:46.840]  is fucking cute though. It's also just called
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:47.620]  Mickey stuff.
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:50.260]  Stuff.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.240]  Just stuff.
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:54.560]  Beanbags. Had a beanbag.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.040]  Taz Geoff?
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:57.560]  $5.
[01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:00.920]  Hey Geoff, what was up with
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.340]  dudes in the 80's
[01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:05.380]  that just got Tasmanian Devil tattooed
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:06.720]  on them? They were very popular.
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:09.600]  The 80's, it was all about the Tasmanian
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.380]  Devil and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish guy.
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:12.160]  That's all we cared about.
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:15.200]  Those were the only two tattoos
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.480]  until tribal tattoos were invented.
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:18.340]  You just knew guys who just had that.
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:20.600]  This person was all about this page.
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:23.280]  Give me the high back video
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.880]  chair. Andrew!
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:26.260]  Oh, Andrew!
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:29.300]  We might have a new chair solution for you.
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:31.360]  You got
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.160]  a long back. It's a high chair.
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:35.300]  I like that. Those kids
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.360]  are in the lab.
[01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:45.410]  This looks like a horror
[01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:47.330]  movie. A sports toddler
[01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:47.850]  bed?
[01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:51.010]  What's sporty about that?
[01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:53.290]  Oh, it's like a football
[01:01:53.290 --> 01:01:55.190]  and hockey stick on the end.
[01:01:55.210 --> 01:01:57.450]  That guy in H is prototyping the sphere
[01:01:57.450 --> 01:01:57.970]  in Vegas.
[01:01:57.970 --> 01:01:58.830]  It's like
[01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:01.770]  it's this but bigger.
[01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:03.050]  You can go inside.
[01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:05.330]  He's like, what are you doing, Billy?
[01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:07.050]  I'm stuffing Bono in this.
[01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:09.790]  This is where you too goes.
[01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:10.990]  What the fuck? You too?
[01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:12.510]  You don't know storage.
[01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:15.970]  I had a
[01:02:15.970 --> 01:02:17.170]  neighbor who had this thing.
[01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:18.610]  You can go inside of it.
[01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:21.870]  I think I was a little bit too big.
[01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:23.770]  To fit in?
[01:02:24.130 --> 01:02:26.070]  Oh, chairs! More chairs!
[01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:27.330]  Cowboys!
[01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:29.670]  Honestly, this baseball one?
[01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:32.250]  I'm a much bigger basketball
[01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:33.970]  than baseball fan, but I'm going hard
[01:02:33.970 --> 01:02:35.850]  baseball if I'm picking one of those chairs.
[01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:36.710]  That baseball chair is awesome.
[01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:38.690]  I would throw it all over the place.
[01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:42.330]  That kid in G is crawling through the anal passage.
[01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:47.470]  I love the team options they give you.
[01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:50.050]  You can get the Cowboys, the Packers, the Bears, the Broncos,
[01:02:50.170 --> 01:02:51.810]  the Patriots, the Steelers, the 49ers, the Panthers.
[01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:52.330]  That's it.
[01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:54.430]  No other teams exist.
[01:02:54.550 --> 01:02:56.130]  Since this magazine came out, the Cowboys
[01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:57.990]  still have not won a Super Bowl.
[01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.950]  That's awesome.
[01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:01.550]  Oh!
[01:03:03.290 --> 01:03:04.570]  Is this shit?
[01:03:05.810 --> 01:03:07.290]  Yeah, I remember this stuff.
[01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:09.910]  My brother, I think, had...
[01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:11.770]  I want to say he had the Time Blaster?
[01:03:12.370 --> 01:03:13.850]  Or something like that?
[01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:15.270]  Talk Blaster?
[01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:18.590]  Photo Blaster?
[01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:19.930]  Quad Shot Camera?
[01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:21.650]  Finger Blaster?
[01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:22.230]  Oh!
[01:03:24.590 --> 01:03:25.090]  Man.
[01:03:26.810 --> 01:03:28.590]  Nickelodeon had a real grip on stuff.
[01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:29.370]  Uh-huh.
[01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:31.730]  Boring.
[01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:35.190]  This is Gavin's science shit.
[01:03:36.350 --> 01:03:37.570]  I would have wanted one of these.
[01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:39.450]  I know, that's why I'm making fun of you.
[01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:40.410]  More science.
[01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:44.010]  Gross. HBO, suck my dick.
[01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:45.930]  This is a toy section.
[01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:47.870]  It's only 30 bucks, man.
[01:03:48.770 --> 01:03:49.630]  It was.
[01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:50.050]  What's the deal?
[01:03:52.050 --> 01:03:53.470]  Math, the VHS.
[01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:54.290]  Hell yeah.
[01:03:54.590 --> 01:03:57.070]  Whatever is going on with Phonics, that's me.
[01:03:59.730 --> 01:04:00.830]  Phonics, VHS.
[01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:02.150]  Damn, you got hooked on them.
[01:04:02.770 --> 01:04:04.610]  45 minutes of Phonics?
[01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:06.630]  The Civil War?
[01:04:07.070 --> 01:04:07.590]  Oh!
[01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:10.490]  Father, I must learn...
[01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:13.470]  I must learn of our nation and its dark history.
[01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:15.810]  I must see what happened in Gettysburg.
[01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:17.870]  I just wanted
[01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:19.430]  the great sports montage,
[01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:21.890]  but I had to get the Civil War box set
[01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:22.470]  with it.
[01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:25.630]  The tapes aren't labeled properly,
[01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:27.230]  so I just put them on and hoped for the best.
[01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:29.770]  Is anything on here?
[01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:30.770]  K, right here.
[01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:32.570]  Bible stories with cassette.
[01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:35.110]  Hell yeah. Nick, we're about to learn
[01:04:35.110 --> 01:04:36.810]  about the love of Christ
[01:04:36.810 --> 01:04:38.910]  and everything that he's done for you.
[01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:39.730]  You're welcome.
[01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:40.970]  But what about the veggies?
[01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:43.830]  Where is God
[01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:44.530]  when I'm scared?
[01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:48.160]  Whoa!
[01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:50.080]  Not for kids.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:53.140]  Dude, hey, at 12 years old
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:53.900]  was it 1998?
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:55.580]  At 12 years old, I was going,
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:58.600]  guys, get me Cary Grant.
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:00.520]  Yeah, I want
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:02.240]  the Bonanza 4 tape set,
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.560]  and if they don't have that, I want World War II.
[01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:07.280]  Andy Griffith show.
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:08.680]  A thing that was always
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:10.720]  on TV and I never watched.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.360]  Hey, I know I'm
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.160]  6 years old and it's 1998,
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:16.520]  but could you get me the 4 disc set
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:17.840]  of Hits of the 70s?
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:20.760]  If they don't have that, I want
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.320]  Golden Band Era.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:24.880]  Mr. Sports
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:25.700]  Bloopers.
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:28.160]  Christmas with the Stars.
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:30.720]  25 hits on 2 CDs. Awesome.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.320]  Mommy, can I have
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.800]  Alfred Hitchcock 4 tape set?
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:36.300]  I really like birds.
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:38.680]  Oh, here we go.
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.960]  You can form a band
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.820]  now. You just have to get 100 pages in
[01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:44.740]  or whatever. You and your brother can put
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.500]  this all together. You can have the drums.
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:47.800]  Brother has a guitar.
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:48.980]  It's great.
[01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:51.180]  Sin Sonics.
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:53.460]  Electric!
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:56.320]  Here we go.
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:58.760]  Look, Grandpa can read his newspaper
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.800]  and these idiots can strum like morons.
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:02.220]  It's great.
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.060]  Everything you want.
[01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.380]  I wonder how much Grandpa got paid for that photo.
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.360]  Be here.
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:09.080]  Oh my God.
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.480]  Check it out. A page for
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:13.980]  getting beat up.
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:18.160]  Can you imagine joining band
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.960]  and then rolling up with your $100 flute?
[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:23.540]  Even more drums.
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:26.280]  Drums hot in 98, dude.
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:28.580]  Turnable bongos.
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:32.500]  Is this Chris Rea or whatever?
[01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:34.440]  He's driving
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:35.040]  home from Christmas.
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:38.480]  The guy who really wants to be John Mellencamp.
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:41.160]  Oh man.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.700]  Man, a lot of instruments.
[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.420]  So many instruments.
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.280]  A whole lot of options if you want to get into music
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:48.940]  in 1998.
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:52.620]  Yeah, put some cassettes on
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:53.240]  for your child.
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:54.780]  Karaoke.
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:57.040]  $200.
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:00.340]  $350.
[01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:00.940]  $350.
[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:02.760]  Geez.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.020]  Oh, it's got the graphics.
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:06.500]  A parent that really loves their kid.
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:08.620]  Yeah, hates themselves.
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.680]  A parent who wants no peace and quiet.
[01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:13.260]  Sing it!
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:16.180]  Encore!
[01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:20.340]  I grew up in such a non-musical
[01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:21.680]  family, I can't even relate.
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:23.460]  I can't imagine my parents
[01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:24.720]  buying this shit for me.
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:25.980]  100%.
[01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:27.700]  Man.
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.900]  Just some Yamaha headphones.
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:32.040]  What the fuck
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.360]  is the Wacky Sax?
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:35.980]  One man band sax?
[01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:37.980]  I got the drums, my brother got
[01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:39.840]  the guitar, and our friend Andrew got something called
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:42.000]  the Wacky Sax, and he said he wants
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.100]  to start a band.
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.560]  It's like if Homer Simpson
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:46.800]  invented an instrument.
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:49.960]  So, I'm not
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.460]  seeing... oh. The Homer.
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:53.880]  I'm not seeing the Wacky Sax
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:55.960]  on eBay, but we should look
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.880]  into it. If we can find one, maybe we should
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:59.940]  start a band where we only play
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:01.120]  instruments from this catalog.
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.600]  A five-piece band.
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.140]  Did they run out of walkie-talkies
[01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:07.920]  so they just repurposed a couple of phones?
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.700]  Who are they kidding with D there?
[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:11.520]  Yeah. Also,
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.720]  just want to point out that
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:16.120]  the electronic guitar with microphone
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.880]  and speaker is marked
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:18.220]  here.
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:20.840]  Do you think they got it?
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:21.580]  No.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.960]  Is this just a
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.600]  scan of one person's catalog?
[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:27.480]  I think so.
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:30.160]  Sea monkeys!
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:31.620]  Free-range ants!
[01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:34.860]  Stop trying to
[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:36.600]  trick us into learning,
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:37.760]  you assholes!
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.340]  Pottery wheel!
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:43.060]  Do you think sea monkeys from
[01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:44.480]  98 would actually hatch?
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:46.100]  You mean Mal?
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.200]  Sure, why not, right?
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:49.800]  Didn't they just defrost a
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.060]  40,000-year-old worm?
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:54.000]  They're all
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:54.740]  kinds of shit.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.060]  It immediately started to asexually reproduce.
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:00.280]  Frog lab?
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:01.780]  Frog lab!
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:03.800]  You don't even need a frog,
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:05.680]  just cut it open, fake frog.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:07.480]  Mold your own frog!
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:10.080]  Then learn the amazing things about the frog
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.120]  inside. Okay, yeah, so you mold one
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:12.860]  and then you cut it open.
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.480]  What do you mold it with?
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.820]  I don't know.
[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:16.220]  Goo?
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.340]  Yeah, it's goo, frog goo.
[01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:22.460]  You get your own frog goo.
[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:23.760]  Wow, nail salon!
[01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:25.140]  Hell yeah!
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.760]  You got nails?
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.000]  Invisible horse!
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:34.320]  Oh, god!
[01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:36.700]  That reminds me, maybe I should talk to you
[01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:38.620]  while I have your attention here.
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:40.420]  Antonio and I were talking
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:42.420]  last night about starting a self-care club
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:44.340]  where once a month we go get
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:46.680]  mani-pedis together. Anybody want in on that?
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:47.400]  I'm way in.
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:50.080]  Alright, absolutely.
[01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:51.900]  I'll keep you guys apprised of when it happens.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:52.620]  I'm in, dude.
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:56.640]  That kid on the left kind of looks like
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:58.620]  Kenneth from 30 Rock.
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:09:59.340]  Yeah!
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.000]  He looks like
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:03.260]  Righteous Gemstones.
[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:06.220]  Oh, um...
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:07.340]  Oh, the older son?
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:09.860]  No, the blonde husband.
[01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:10.240]  Yeah.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.040]  Oh, uh...
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:13.480]  BJ.
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:16.860]  Yeah, he just looks like BJ.
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.500]  God, it shows so good.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.980]  When Eric Andre calls him Little Dolly
[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:23.780]  or Little Debbie, right before he shoots him.
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:27.800]  This is just paints and crayons.
[01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:28.480]  Get out of here.
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:29.840]  I also don't care about this.
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:32.660]  Oh, is that a gun?
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.780]  Is that like a magic shot arcade?
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:37.780]  You see that B guy?
[01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:38.640]  Right there, B.
[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:40.460]  Human Anatomy Male Science Kid.
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:43.500]  The ring bearer from the wedding, Dash.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.020]  He got me that for Christmas last year.
[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:46.940]  What?!
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:49.160]  It's in my pocket right now.
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:49.840]  I'm pretty sure.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:51.760]  So what do you do? Just look at it?
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:55.760]  Well, the way it worked last Christmas
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:56.920]  is he gave it to you and he said,
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:58.060]  Hey, I got this for you for Christmas
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:10:58.800]  and I opened it up and I was like,
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:00.080]  Oh, cool, Human Anatomy Think Station.
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:01.500]  He goes, Yeah, cool, can I play with it now?
[01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:02.860]  And I was like, Oh, awesome.
[01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:05.740]  That kid knows what's up, I like it.
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:07.020]  Classic child stuff.
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:09.700]  It looks like Kevin Bacon in that movie.
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:11.440]  Oh, he did!
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:13.680]  With Elizabeth Chu.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.000]  Babylon 5.
[01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:17.440]  Magnet board game.
[01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:18.340]  Xena board game.
[01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:20.660]  Kids loved Babylon 5 in the 90s.
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:21.360]  And Xena.
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:25.180]  This is...
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:27.640]  I'm worried that we're getting into the board game section.
[01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:28.320]  We are.
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:30.520]  I know Xena
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:31.560]  was a big deal.
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:33.180]  I lived through the Xena era.
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.420]  But at the time that it was on
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:38.460]  the air, I never met a
[01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:40.420]  single person who watched it.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.040]  I think nobody wanted to admit it.
[01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:45.160]  Yeah.
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.260]  They were all online in 1997.
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.060]  It was so weird.
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:51.720]  I remember thinking, how is this show...
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.520]  I don't know a single human being that watches it.
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:55.060]  Can we go back for a minute, Eric?
[01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:55.760]  Sure.
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:58.660]  What is Titanic the board game?
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.100]  Gossip with other
[01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:03.260]  passengers. Receive telegrams
[01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:05.140]  and collect all five pieces of
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:07.080]  your personal property to advance
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.100]  from second class to the first class section
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:10.620]  of the ship. But watch out!
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:12.560]  You might get put back in
[01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:13.980]  steerage?
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:17.080]  Or worse yet, never make it
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:18.600]  to your lifeboat on time.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:21.480]  You could die in Titanic the game.
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:22.940]  Did you ever play this
[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:24.540]  CD-ROM game of Titanic?
[01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:28.820]  And it had maybe the worst music I've ever heard
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:29.200]  in a game.
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.020]  We need to look into that.
[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:34.960]  That is such
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.020]  a fucked up game, that Titanic
[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:38.340]  board game. It's terrible.
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:41.080]  I want this grandfather clock for Christmas.
[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:42.920]  It's like, make your way past the women
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:44.640]  and children to secure your spot.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:46.540]  Billy Zane style.
[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:48.980]  Yeah, you've drawn the, this is my child card.
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:51.040]  Oh, Puz 3D.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.220]  I always wanted one of these.
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.900]  Oh, they're actually not expensive. Why didn't I get one?
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.420]  Hang on, I was lied to.
[01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:01.240]  I don't think the Mount Rushmore was available
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:02.600]  for my market.
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:04.340]  Cookie Carp?
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:05.420]  Do you think they have Stonehenge?
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:09.540]  That'd be a pretty easy puzzle.
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:12.420]  Yeah, it would.
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:15.000]  Would you say it's the best
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.480]  Henge? Yeah.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.140]  I would think so, yeah.
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:19.780]  It's gotta be up there.
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:20.720]  I had Twister.
[01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:26.020]  Operations, Battleship.
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:27.240]  We had Bop It.
[01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:29.040]  Bop It was cool, I guess.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.280]  Are there any games here
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:33.900]  that you haven't owned or played?
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:35.440]  Spyweb, maybe.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:37.140]  I've never heard of Spyweb.
[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:39.940]  Lionheart. I might still have that
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:42.180]  Trivial Pursuit, Star Wars edition.
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:43.960]  I never played Gate of Gulf.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.060]  Oh, you give it a whack
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:47.420]  and it throws it right back.
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:50.280]  We used to play Bop It at T&I all the time, Gus and I did.
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:50.960]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:53.160]  Dude, I watched
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.360]  the Best Friends Today do
[01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:56.660]  Live Operation.
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:58.940]  The other day, that was pretty fucking funny.
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:01.660]  What was that, Extra Life? Yeah, they did a great job.
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:03.560]  Let's see.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:05.720]  More fishing!
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:07.640]  More fishing, yeah.
[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:10.100]  Oh my god, I have
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:11.960]  this Disney game. It is on the thing right
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:13.760]  behind me. It is right here. Oh, really?
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.420]  Yeah, it is right here. This game
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:17.800]  fucking sucks. It's impossible
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.840]  and you still have it. The trivia is
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.700]  awful. Yeah, I take it to parties and make people
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:23.300]  play it and they get mad every time.
[01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:25.540]  Is it from
[01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:26.840]  98? Oh yeah.
[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:29.480]  So the trivia is all old as
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:31.780]  balls. It's like the oldest shit in the
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:33.720]  world. And like some of it's irrelevant
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.460]  now. It's like asking questions like
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:37.840]  that have nothing to do with Disney movies at all.
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:39.760]  Men
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:40.840]  are from Mars.
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:43.000]  3D
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.400]  tic-tac-toe?
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.940]  Toss-across? I had a friend who had
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:48.940]  this. Oh yeah, you play it with beanbags,
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:50.420]  right? Yeah, you throw it and then you're
[01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:52.800]  X and you throw it and you're trying to get it
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.720]  to like land on X, but sometimes it'll go
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:56.820]  O and you're like, ah! And still like mess it up.
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:58.720]  Yeah. Or does it like... okay,
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:01.040]  cool. I thought it was like...
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:02.740]  yeah, yeah, yeah. And then men are
[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:04.100]  from Mars, women are from Venus game.
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.260]  Great. Cool.
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.820]  Love it. You can learn about the difference between men and
[01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:10.940]  women. Finally, but in a
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.540]  very fun format.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.200]  Hip-Hoppers?
[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:16.600]  Whoa.
[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:18.900]  What the fuck?
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:20.740]  These lovable 12-inch tall
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:22.800]  animals hip-hop to a jammin'
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:23.220]  beat.
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:26.760]  You
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.720]  read it like you can't believe it's written.
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:30.880]  You could get Sasha
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.800]  or Quincy for $20.
[01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:33.940]  This is full of aliens.
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:36.260]  There's a lot of stock cars in this catalog.
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:37.080]  Yeah, really.
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:40.100]  NASCAR was big
[01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:42.320]  in the 90s. That might be the
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:43.400]  what page are we on?
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:46.000]  148? 131?
[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:48.180]  Yeah, this says 131, yeah. I think
[01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:49.980]  that might be the first gun we've seen.
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:52.000]  No, no, there was a
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.320]  shooting game. Oh, the alien gun
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:55.700]  arcade thing. Oh, okay.
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:58.700]  That might be the second game we've seen.
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:00.260]  Or gun we've seen. You mean...
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:02.380]  Are they muzzle-loading
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:04.340]  the Super Soaker? Yeah, yeah, that was a
[01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:05.560]  Super Soaker that you could
[01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:08.160]  stick down, attach it to a hose, and it
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:10.220]  filled in from the front. We've been
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:11.960]  talking for so long now
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.540]  I'm really starting to lose it.
[01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:16.440]  I'm starting to lose it.
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:18.160]  I read that last page, it was like
[01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:20.600]  I read it as Christy.
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:24.580]  That's a bit Christy
[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:25.980]  for my taste. This is just trees.
[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:30.380]  Oh, bubblegum! I love
[01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:32.460]  gumball machines. As a kid.
[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:34.660]  As a kid.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.140]  What do you have against them as an adult?
[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:38.320]  I can buy them anytime.
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.400]  There are simply more adult ways
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.500]  for me to consume my gum.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.560]  And gumballs lose flavor a lot faster
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:45.640]  than regular gum. Yeah, they do.
[01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:48.420]  Geoff, when you are no longer a child, you put away childish
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:48.880]  things.
[01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:51.680]  I still like a gumball machine.
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:53.560]  Cake in the mail?
[01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:55.300]  Just cakes?
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:58.440]  Butter batter fruit cake.
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:00.560]  Masterpiece fruit cake.
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:02.760]  Who's ordering cake from a catalog?
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.700]  Catalog cake, huh?
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.660]  Ooh, chocolate pretzels and mini graham
[01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:10.840]  crackers. What the fuck is this?
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:13.880]  Can we order that lady?
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.780]  Oh no, we're halfway through, Gavin.
[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:16.440]  Oh.
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:19.320]  You gonna start clicking faster or what?
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.740]  It takes a long time to load.
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.500]  I think we should just back out,
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:26.440]  go to it, and then go to electronics
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:27.420]  on 278.
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:28.460]  Just keep going.
[01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:31.620]  Okay, Andrew wants
[01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:32.460]  to stick, just keep going.
[01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:34.600]  You don't want to miss any of this gold?
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:35.580]  Look at that.
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:38.460]  Did this turn into a marathon thing, huh?
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.520]  Let's click faster, Eric.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.320]  It loads
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.460]  slow.
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:45.640]  Michael Jordan!
[01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:49.400]  We would have missed out on Michael Jordan.
[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:51.280]  Everybody remembers that
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:53.060]  all-important
[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:54.940]  Michael Jordan Rayovac
[01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:56.940]  He's a Rayovac guy.
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:17:58.900]  Have you ever
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:00.860]  seen a Rayovac autographed
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:01.840]  Michael Jordan card?
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.760]  I'm gonna look for him now.
[01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:07.220]  Do you think he knew what he was smiling for in that picture?
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:08.920]  Ooh, now we're getting into some
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:10.880]  real toys. You could get a Ferengi
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:12.660]  talking bank. Whoa!
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.420]  What's with the...
[01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:15.880]  Star Wars shit?
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:18.400]  Dude, it's already...
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:20.760]  They published this fucking
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:23.160]  catalog with a 50% off on it.
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.620]  What is that? An R2-D2
[01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:27.000]  tied to a fire extinguisher?
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:27.500]  What's happening?
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.280]  R2, there's a fire!
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:35.380]  It's a little remote control,
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:36.320]  I think. He drives by.
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:38.900]  Oh, never mind.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:41.580]  R2, you're not putting out the fire.
[01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:43.240]  Dude, that guy is making
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:44.680]  two Millennium Falcons kiss.
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:48.820]  He's discovered...
[01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:50.480]  He's going through puberty in that photo.
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.360]  He heard a rumor that
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.280]  if you make them kiss a
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:55.780]  baby Millennium Falcon,
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:57.860]  you leave it overnight.
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:00.400]  A century falcon
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:02.320]  pops out. Wow.
[01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:04.620]  Darts!
[01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:05.500]  Ooh, kids' darts.
[01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:08.500]  Great. Andrew hates darts.
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.520]  I would get so annoyed
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:12.500]  if someone gave me a custom dart kit
[01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:14.240]  as a gift. Well,
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:16.360]  you just asked for one, so thank you.
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:17.460]  Darts are fun.
[01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:20.280]  This is nothing.
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.020]  It's super values.
[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:23.400]  It's a shitty toy pitch.
[01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:25.740]  I don't understand how this is organized.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.740]  We're already back in Barbie, but we only went
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:29.900]  through two Barbie sections. It's all over the place.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.140]  Star Trek Barbie.
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:33.380]  Super value Barbie.
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:35.240]  Super value Barbie.
[01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:37.720]  So we're just in the bargain bin section of the catalog?
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:39.700]  I think we're just in the bargain of the catalog.
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:41.460]  It looks Wes Ellis.
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:45.820]  That kid in the helmet,
[01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:47.840]  he looks like me when I'm
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:49.060]  dancing to Feliz Navidad.
[01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:52.780]  Awesome.
[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:55.420]  This is the
[01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:58.160]  section of the catalog where they...
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.840]  They gotta try to move all
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:01.140]  this shit they didn't sell last time.
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:03.880]  All this stuff we
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:06.040]  couldn't shift in the first 150
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:08.300]  pages. 97's
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:09.840]  hottest items are 98's most
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.360]  deeply discounted bargains. Yep.
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.360]  Oh, that checks out.
[01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:16.900]  Plush gorilla.
[01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:19.200]  You can't see any detail.
[01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:21.300]  I can't imagine why they didn't sell this.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.580]  They could have photographed that better.
[01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:25.740]  It looks like Garbo, man.
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:28.100]  It does look like Garbo, man.
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:30.880]  Oh, man.
[01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:35.700]  We already did the speak and spell section.
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:37.360]  That's what I'm saying. Oh, is that Brio?
[01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:39.600]  I like Brio train. Geoff, you don't want to play
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.680]  mall madness? Electronic mall madness?
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:43.080]  I do, actually.
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:44.700]  I do want to play that.
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:46.680]  What is it called? Electronic mall madness?
[01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:48.160]  Let's see if we can get that.
[01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:52.910]  Electronic mall
[01:20:53.550 --> 01:20:55.190]  madness. Extreme
[01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:56.310]  Ghostbusters?
[01:20:56.710 --> 01:20:59.330]  Oh, there are a lot
[01:20:59.330 --> 01:21:01.190]  of versions of mall madness.
[01:21:02.450 --> 01:21:03.490]  That checks out.
[01:21:03.770 --> 01:21:05.130]  We can definitely get this.
[01:21:05.310 --> 01:21:06.570]  Eric, I need the Eric card.
[01:21:06.890 --> 01:21:08.810]  Should we play mall madness at the mall?
[01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:11.510]  Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[01:21:11.610 --> 01:21:12.950]  We can do it while you're wearing the boots.
[01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:13.750]  Oh, no!
[01:21:15.150 --> 01:21:17.310]  Um, Congo the game.
[01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:19.030]  These Tiger Electronics games
[01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:20.950]  or whatever. I miss them. They were such a thing.
[01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:22.930]  They were such shit, but I
[01:21:22.930 --> 01:21:25.090]  missed them. Terrible, terrible, terrible.
[01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:28.470]  Oh, a little Digimon and
[01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:30.190]  a Tamagotchi. Oh, a Tamagotchi.
[01:21:31.150 --> 01:21:32.110]  Packers darts.
[01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:34.770]  Andrew, be mad at it.
[01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:35.810]  Okay, fine.
[01:21:36.090 --> 01:21:37.670]  They're not personalized. It's okay.
[01:21:38.890 --> 01:21:41.090]  Now we're in the electronic games.
[01:21:41.090 --> 01:21:42.650]  This is... More fishing!
[01:21:43.210 --> 01:21:44.730]  That's the third fishing page.
[01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:45.450]  Fake fishing.
[01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:47.610]  What is J?
[01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:50.010]  Stealth assault.
[01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:52.910]  I am buying mall madness right now.
[01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:53.390]  Yes!
[01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:56.950]  Do you think everything in this catalog
[01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:59.030]  was purchased or do you think they could have been one item
[01:21:59.030 --> 01:22:00.270]  that literally no one bought?
[01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:02.630]  I don't think anybody bought that gorilla, dude.
[01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:04.210]  Or maybe that table.
[01:22:04.490 --> 01:22:06.330]  They finally did a Bible Trivia 2.
[01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:08.910]  I know all
[01:22:08.910 --> 01:22:10.850]  the answers to Bible Trivia 1.
[01:22:11.410 --> 01:22:12.790]  I'm looking for some new gods.
[01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:14.550]  What would Jesus do?
[01:22:14.730 --> 01:22:15.350]  Video games!
[01:22:17.010 --> 01:22:18.950]  Surely a couple of the guitars
[01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:20.790]  that showed up on page 200
[01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:22.710]  didn't get bought because there were 7,000
[01:22:22.710 --> 01:22:24.910]  before them. Dude, I was so
[01:22:24.910 --> 01:22:26.870]  freaking jealous of the kids that had
[01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:28.310]  the camera and the printer for the Game Boy.
[01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:30.390]  Oh, I had that. You had that?
[01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:32.470]  You were one of those kids.
[01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:36.070]  That was such a luxury.
[01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:38.330]  Cause you're basically saying goodbye
[01:22:38.330 --> 01:22:39.010]  to a game.
[01:22:40.130 --> 01:22:41.730]  Whenever I see, I heard
[01:22:41.730 --> 01:22:44.150]  like a podcast where Dan
[01:22:44.150 --> 01:22:46.170]  Riker told the story about that he used to
[01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:48.210]  store all his porn on the
[01:22:48.210 --> 01:22:50.250]  Game Boy camera cause he was scared
[01:22:50.250 --> 01:22:52.370]  like they would find the Playboy magazine
[01:22:52.370 --> 01:22:54.130]  in his room
[01:22:54.130 --> 01:22:56.310]  so he just took photos using the Game Boy
[01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:58.370]  camera so that was like the only
[01:22:58.370 --> 01:22:59.870]  point of porn he had.
[01:23:00.490 --> 01:23:02.450]  Whenever I see Game Boy Camera I think of
[01:23:02.450 --> 01:23:03.930]  white shit, bootleg porn.
[01:23:04.850 --> 01:23:05.630]  That's a good idea.
[01:23:05.630 --> 01:23:07.350]  Printer refills, $20.
[01:23:08.670 --> 01:23:10.030]  Nick just said that's
[01:23:10.030 --> 01:23:12.010]  a good idea, like he's gonna run out and grab
[01:23:12.010 --> 01:23:13.910]  a Game Boy Camera right now
[01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:15.250]  so he can tell all his porn.
[01:23:16.730 --> 01:23:18.010]  I'm old enough to not need
[01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:18.470]  to do that.
[01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:21.130]  Also Mary.
[01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:22.610]  Oh yeah, also Mary.
[01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:25.790]  Oh yeah. Did you have
[01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:26.670]  Pokemon Red or Blue?
[01:23:27.850 --> 01:23:29.750]  I think it was Red. I had Yellow.
[01:23:30.490 --> 01:23:31.530]  Yeah, I had Blue.
[01:23:31.530 --> 01:23:33.190]  You didn't play anyone before Yellow?
[01:23:33.850 --> 01:23:35.110]  Nope. Wow.
[01:23:36.210 --> 01:23:37.590]  That must have been a tough question
[01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:38.470]  when you were a kid, right?
[01:23:39.150 --> 01:23:40.450]  Do I want to get
[01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:43.450]  The Legend of Zelda or do I want to spend my money
[01:23:43.450 --> 01:23:45.170]  on Game Boy printer refills?
[01:23:46.090 --> 01:23:47.550]  Oh, after they ran out it was
[01:23:47.550 --> 01:23:47.970]  Game Over.
[01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:50.390]  Dude, the printer was $70!
[01:23:51.050 --> 01:23:51.270]  Yeah.
[01:23:52.670 --> 01:23:53.110]  Hey!
[01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:56.290]  Now we're talking.
[01:23:57.410 --> 01:23:59.770]  Kobe Bryant's NBA courtside? I had that.
[01:23:59.770 --> 01:24:01.130]  Oh, I never played that.
[01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:03.310]  These games were expensive.
[01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:04.970]  Not very good, but I liked it.
[01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.730]  They are expensive.
[01:24:06.610 --> 01:24:07.750]  Did games get cheaper?
[01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:10.930]  That's like over $100 now.
[01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:12.350]  64 games are expensive.
[01:24:13.610 --> 01:24:15.430]  Yeah, the games have been
[01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:17.670]  the same price and that's the thing
[01:24:17.670 --> 01:24:18.990]  that you always hear now is like,
[01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:20.650]  oh, we're losing all this money on these games
[01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:23.270]  because we had to open it to $70 or whatever
[01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:25.510]  and you look back at this stuff and they were $65
[01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:26.610]  or whatever.
[01:24:26.610 --> 01:24:28.790]  But it's like, I'm not going to pay $110
[01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:30.290]  for a video game.
[01:24:30.670 --> 01:24:32.570]  My N64 games were like £49
[01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:33.970]  and then I think
[01:24:34.690 --> 01:24:37.110]  Donkey Kong 64 was like £60
[01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:38.230]  Oh yeah.
[01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:39.390]  Because it came with the expansion.
[01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:42.170]  I don't think you'd ever see...
[01:24:42.170 --> 01:24:44.310]  Bomberman Hero is a game title
[01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:46.070]  that exists pre-9-11.
[01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:48.210]  You're not getting Bomberman Hero
[01:24:48.210 --> 01:24:50.510]  post that. I remember Bomberman Hero.
[01:24:52.490 --> 01:24:53.690]  I did
[01:24:53.690 --> 01:24:54.630]  Achievement Hunter
[01:24:54.630 --> 01:24:56.690]  guides in that game
[01:24:56.690 --> 01:24:57.470]  I think.
[01:24:58.530 --> 01:25:00.710]  Yoshi's Story, I couldn't get past
[01:25:00.710 --> 01:25:02.470]  a section in it for weeks
[01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:04.230]  and I only got past it because
[01:25:04.230 --> 01:25:06.530]  my mom's friend's
[01:25:06.530 --> 01:25:08.630]  daughter played it and she called to ask
[01:25:08.630 --> 01:25:10.650]  if they had gotten through it and I had to
[01:25:10.650 --> 01:25:12.090]  learn that you could ground and pound.
[01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:14.630]  I just missed that mechanic and you needed it
[01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:15.830]  to get past the thing.
[01:25:17.370 --> 01:25:18.590]  Also, look at the
[01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:20.390]  difference in price between the console
[01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:22.290]  itself and the game. It's like the
[01:25:22.290 --> 01:25:23.550]  price of two games.
[01:25:24.330 --> 01:25:26.370]  Now, a console is the price of like
[01:25:26.370 --> 01:25:27.770]  nine games.
[01:25:29.610 --> 01:25:30.750]  Diddy Kong Racing?
[01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:32.050]  Underrated racing game.
[01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.910]  Yeah, great.
[01:25:33.810 --> 01:25:35.510]  Fantastic racing game.
[01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:37.530]  Love Diddy Kong. Love Diddy Kong Racing.
[01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:39.270]  Love all the characters in it.
[01:25:40.850 --> 01:25:42.410]  Bring the power
[01:25:42.410 --> 01:25:44.370]  home! WWF Warzone.
[01:25:45.090 --> 01:25:46.650]  Bad game, but at the time
[01:25:46.650 --> 01:25:47.230]  groundbreaking.
[01:25:48.450 --> 01:25:50.590]  NFL Quarterback Club 99.
[01:25:50.590 --> 01:25:52.130]  Had it. Played it.
[01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:53.790]  Played the fucking shit out of it.
[01:25:54.150 --> 01:25:56.630]  That Mission Impossible game was so
[01:25:56.630 --> 01:25:57.810]  freaking difficult.
[01:25:58.530 --> 01:26:00.650]  Although you could shoot people in the
[01:26:00.650 --> 01:26:02.450]  head and they would do a full backflip.
[01:26:02.730 --> 01:26:03.470]  That's awesome.
[01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:06.650]  Okay, so you get one game
[01:26:06.650 --> 01:26:07.710]  off this page. What are you buying?
[01:26:10.630 --> 01:26:11.310]  Turok 2.
[01:26:13.010 --> 01:26:14.230]  Probably WWF Warzone.
[01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:16.190]  Yeah, Warzone. Blitz.
[01:26:16.810 --> 01:26:18.730]  Blitz is a good one though. Blitz is great.
[01:26:18.730 --> 01:26:20.690]  I'm either getting Turok
[01:26:20.690 --> 01:26:22.950]  or Offroad Challenge. That was a good game.
[01:26:22.970 --> 01:26:24.050]  Do you wanna come back?
[01:26:24.370 --> 01:26:25.990]  4 fucking sucks.
[01:26:26.650 --> 01:26:28.470]  I remember getting stuck on
[01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:30.570]  Mission Impossible because one of the objectives
[01:26:30.570 --> 01:26:32.730]  in the first level was you have to get
[01:26:32.730 --> 01:26:34.770]  the score and it was like a music
[01:26:34.770 --> 01:26:36.570]  thing. You have to get the piano
[01:26:36.570 --> 01:26:38.170]  and I just didn't know what a score was.
[01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:40.390]  What's the score?
[01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:42.070]  Couldn't figure it out.
[01:26:42.650 --> 01:26:43.890]  Clayfighter wasn't bad.
[01:26:44.290 --> 01:26:46.650]  I think it was like a
[01:26:46.650 --> 01:26:48.910]  good idea. Yeah, it was a fun game.
[01:26:49.230 --> 01:26:50.570]  Quest 64 is always really
[01:26:50.570 --> 01:26:52.270]  dogged on, but I don't think it's a terrible game.
[01:26:52.350 --> 01:26:54.010]  I've never played it. I don't know anything about it.
[01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:55.650]  Here we go.
[01:26:56.190 --> 01:26:58.710]  Baby Mario. God, I love
[01:26:58.710 --> 01:27:00.570]  Star Fox 64. Who's not
[01:27:00.570 --> 01:27:02.550]  in either of those games. And Shadows.
[01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:04.550]  Baby Mario is not
[01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:06.430]  in any of...
[01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:08.530]  He's not in any of the games
[01:27:08.530 --> 01:27:10.530]  listed on there. Oh no, Yoshi's Island
[01:27:10.530 --> 01:27:12.490]  is G, but he's not
[01:27:13.410 --> 01:27:14.690]  for some reason listed
[01:27:14.690 --> 01:27:15.210]  in any of these.
[01:27:16.590 --> 01:27:18.530]  Wave Race 64 where you can unlock the dolphin?
[01:27:18.810 --> 01:27:20.550]  Great. Star Fox 64, maybe
[01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:22.590]  one of my favorite games ever made.
[01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:24.610]  Such a great game. Period. I didn't know
[01:27:24.610 --> 01:27:26.390]  that was a Star Fox game because
[01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:28.610]  in England it was called Lylat Wars.
[01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:29.770]  Oh yeah.
[01:27:30.530 --> 01:27:32.550]  That's the name of the system they're in. I don't know
[01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:34.190]  why they did that. Yeah, and
[01:27:34.190 --> 01:27:36.570]  original Star Fox was called Starwing.
[01:27:36.990 --> 01:27:38.590]  Yeah, I think Star Fox might have
[01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:40.290]  been a copyrighted term from something else.
[01:27:40.730 --> 01:27:42.570]  Yeah. But Star Fox
[01:27:42.570 --> 01:27:44.130]  64 is a game that I
[01:27:44.130 --> 01:27:46.570]  beat every way that you could and earned
[01:27:46.570 --> 01:27:48.330]  all the medals and then you could play
[01:27:48.330 --> 01:27:49.810]  multiplayer where you run around on the ground.
[01:27:50.590 --> 01:27:51.650]  Or be in a tank.
[01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:53.230]  You could be in a tank.
[01:27:55.010 --> 01:27:55.910]  Bang a soundtrack.
[01:27:56.450 --> 01:27:57.110]  Oh yeah.
[01:27:58.710 --> 01:28:00.630]  And there's the worst game ever made.
[01:28:01.190 --> 01:28:02.570]  Super Mario 64.
[01:28:03.570 --> 01:28:04.010]  Woof.
[01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:06.070]  How much is it here?
[01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:08.250]  Oh, it's $20.
[01:28:09.570 --> 01:28:10.630]  You're in control of
[01:28:10.630 --> 01:28:12.630]  up to eight. Oh, is it like
[01:28:12.630 --> 01:28:13.550]  a switcher?
[01:28:14.590 --> 01:28:16.730]  Yeah, yeah. Eight different inputs
[01:28:16.730 --> 01:28:18.230]  for your TV set. Wow!
[01:28:19.090 --> 01:28:20.030]  And then a bunch of
[01:28:20.730 --> 01:28:21.210]  controllers.
[01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:23.330]  Whoa.
[01:28:26.150 --> 01:28:26.790]  It's like
[01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:28.390]  a controller shagged one of those weird
[01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:30.770]  hinged laptops from 50 pages ago.
[01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:34.650]  Alright, here we go.
[01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:36.190]  Some PlayStation.
[01:28:39.250 --> 01:28:40.890]  So, how much
[01:28:40.890 --> 01:28:41.610]  was the PlayStation?
[01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:43.710]  It was...
[01:28:43.710 --> 01:28:45.410]  Is that say $129?
[01:28:46.130 --> 01:28:47.670]  Yeah, I think the same as the N64.
[01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:49.510]  Yeah, they were pretty competitive that way.
[01:28:49.530 --> 01:28:50.310]  But the games were cheaper.
[01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:53.510]  Because I guess just a disc.
[01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.130]  Yeah.
[01:28:55.770 --> 01:28:56.690]  Crazy. Wow.
[01:28:57.190 --> 01:28:58.630]  And the bundles of like, you get
[01:28:58.630 --> 01:29:00.870]  Parappa the Rapper and Crash for $2.19
[01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:01.770]  with the console.
[01:29:02.610 --> 01:29:04.250]  What a steal too.
[01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:06.030]  That's fucking great.
[01:29:06.230 --> 01:29:07.490]  Those are two great games.
[01:29:09.450 --> 01:29:10.070]  Wow.
[01:29:11.210 --> 01:29:12.430]  Final Fantasy 7
[01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:12.930]  on here too.
[01:29:13.450 --> 01:29:14.970]  Could you even get
[01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:18.470]  an original PlayStation for less than that now?
[01:29:18.930 --> 01:29:19.290]  No.
[01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:21.930]  It's gone up in value.
[01:29:22.510 --> 01:29:23.470]  Does anyone want to buy one?
[01:29:26.050 --> 01:29:28.290]  I don't think that pistol's
[01:29:28.290 --> 01:29:28.930]  big enough.
[01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:31.110]  Get bigger!
[01:29:31.810 --> 01:29:32.830]  Tekken 3.
[01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:34.330]  Tekken 3 was fucking great.
[01:29:35.110 --> 01:29:36.290]  Rampage is fun.
[01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.530]  Yeah.
[01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:39.490]  Some great games.
[01:29:41.290 --> 01:29:42.750]  Terrible controllers down here.
[01:29:43.490 --> 01:29:43.970]  What's going on?
[01:29:44.890 --> 01:29:46.430]  N64 controller for the PlayStation?
[01:29:46.930 --> 01:29:47.210]  Yeah.
[01:29:48.290 --> 01:29:49.390]  It's the future!
[01:29:50.730 --> 01:29:55.490]  No, it's an advanced Nintendo 64 controller.
[01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.830]  How weird.
[01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:57.470]  It's just on the PlayStation page.
[01:29:57.470 --> 01:29:58.870]  No, it's weird.
[01:30:01.090 --> 01:30:01.590]  Oh,
[01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:02.570]  Punky Skunk?
[01:30:03.550 --> 01:30:04.270]  Everyone's favorite.
[01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:07.330]  What is
[01:30:07.330 --> 01:30:08.470]  Punky Skunk?
[01:30:08.930 --> 01:30:09.630]  I don't know.
[01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:13.490]  Thrash, skate, dig, glide, and jump past
[01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:15.070]  mutant mice to win.
[01:30:15.290 --> 01:30:15.910]  For one player.
[01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:18.670]  That Frogger game sucked. I bought it.
[01:30:18.770 --> 01:30:20.390]  And that Speed Racer game sucked. I bought it.
[01:30:23.210 --> 01:30:25.510]  X-Men vs. Street Fighter was fucking awesome.
[01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:27.450]  Awesome. That game rules.
[01:30:27.550 --> 01:30:29.490]  X-Men vs. Street Fighter was so fucking cool.
[01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:31.170]  When I was in Kuwait,
[01:30:31.490 --> 01:30:33.130]  one of the times I was in Kuwait,
[01:30:33.610 --> 01:30:35.630]  they had that
[01:30:37.970 --> 01:30:38.950]  stand-up machine there.
[01:30:39.070 --> 01:30:40.490]  It was the only thing they had.
[01:30:40.650 --> 01:30:43.610]  They had a little DVD or a VHS lending library
[01:30:43.610 --> 01:30:45.030]  where you could rent like eight different movies.
[01:30:45.450 --> 01:30:47.290]  And they had that arcade game.
[01:30:47.490 --> 01:30:49.650]  And so there was just a line of like 40 dudes
[01:30:49.650 --> 01:30:51.150]  to play it all day and all night
[01:30:51.150 --> 01:30:52.850]  for the four months I was there.
[01:30:52.850 --> 01:30:54.090]  The X-Files game.
[01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:55.710]  X-Files game.
[01:30:56.370 --> 01:30:58.230]  Croc. A lot of Fox Sports.
[01:30:59.170 --> 01:31:00.970]  Yeah, I don't remember the Fox Sports
[01:31:00.970 --> 01:31:02.090]  line of games. Weird.
[01:31:02.430 --> 01:31:04.770]  Very strange.
[01:31:06.090 --> 01:31:07.070]  What the fuck?
[01:31:07.530 --> 01:31:08.430]  And we're out.
[01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.630]  What happened?
[01:31:10.130 --> 01:31:13.150]  I want those skateboards so bad!
[01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:15.070]  I want the Mario Kart star.
[01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:16.850]  Oh my god, that's so cool!
[01:31:18.570 --> 01:31:20.030]  That's so cool.
[01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:21.950]  The Scooteroo.
[01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:22.670]  Scooteroo.
[01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:25.550]  That sounds like a British thing.
[01:31:27.850 --> 01:31:29.310]  Does she know how the ball works?
[01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:30.550]  Oh, okay.
[01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:34.250]  That little girl looks like she's surrendering to the basketball rim.
[01:31:34.730 --> 01:31:35.050]  Don't do it!
[01:31:36.690 --> 01:31:38.370]  Electric talking rotten egg.
[01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:39.950]  I can just imagine that thing just
[01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:40.730]  swearing at you.
[01:31:42.970 --> 01:31:43.930]  Electric talking...
[01:31:43.930 --> 01:31:44.790]  Let's see if that's on.
[01:31:44.890 --> 01:31:47.030]  Do you think it's just begging for death?
[01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:48.590]  Fucking kill me!
[01:31:48.730 --> 01:31:50.810]  Just kill me! Stop
[01:31:50.810 --> 01:31:51.610]  bashing me!
[01:31:51.810 --> 01:31:52.890]  This isn't a way to live!
[01:31:55.630 --> 01:31:56.510]  Do it!
[01:31:56.690 --> 01:31:58.870]  You know that was... oh, you can buy them.
[01:31:59.750 --> 01:32:00.350]  Oh, wow.
[01:32:00.970 --> 01:32:02.050]  They're all over eBay.
[01:32:03.730 --> 01:32:04.610]  You know that was like
[01:32:04.610 --> 01:32:06.690]  somebody invented that
[01:32:06.690 --> 01:32:08.270]  and they had to take it and pitch it
[01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:10.110]  and they were so fucking excited about it and they were like,
[01:32:10.210 --> 01:32:12.210]  trust me, I know kids, this is gonna be huge.
[01:32:12.650 --> 01:32:15.270]  They put everything they had into it.
[01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:16.730]  S?
[01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:19.210]  Macho Man Randy Savage? I'm looking
[01:32:19.210 --> 01:32:21.410]  at that right now. It's on my shelf to the left.
[01:32:21.710 --> 01:32:22.190]  Oh, wow.
[01:32:22.710 --> 01:32:24.270]  We all do have things from this.
[01:32:25.230 --> 01:32:26.450]  But not Sting?
[01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:29.290]  I have Sting. I also have a Diamond Dallas
[01:32:29.290 --> 01:32:30.730]  page one, but he's not shown here.
[01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:31.510]  I love Sting.
[01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:34.330]  Sting! He's great.
[01:32:34.710 --> 01:32:36.850]  But yeah, Macho Man Randy Savage, you'd like
[01:32:37.490 --> 01:32:39.250]  press like their hand or like their foot
[01:32:39.250 --> 01:32:41.310]  or like twist their nose and they go, hey, get off
[01:32:41.310 --> 01:32:42.110]  of my arm!
[01:32:42.970 --> 01:32:43.430]  Laughing
[01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:45.330]  Laughing
[01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:47.790]  Laughing
[01:32:47.790 --> 01:32:48.150]  This is great.
[01:32:50.110 --> 01:32:50.570]  Oh!
[01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:54.110]  I mean, you wanna be a hustler
[01:32:54.110 --> 01:32:54.710]  as a kid?
[01:32:56.210 --> 01:32:57.910]  A kid on the left sure looks like one.
[01:32:58.410 --> 01:32:58.870]  Laughing
[01:32:59.810 --> 01:33:00.270]  Damn.
[01:33:00.930 --> 01:33:03.670]  I think we got through the video game stuff
[01:33:03.670 --> 01:33:04.730]  and that was the important stuff.
[01:33:04.850 --> 01:33:06.310]  I think we're winding down here.
[01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:09.390]  I'll jog through, but this was fun.
[01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:10.750]  Going through...
[01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:13.310]  The 9th Fisher Price section.
[01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:15.270]  Enough of you Fisher Price.
[01:33:16.330 --> 01:33:17.150]  This was fun.
[01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:19.870]  Going through this catalog I think was like...
[01:33:19.870 --> 01:33:20.290]  Silly.
[01:33:20.670 --> 01:33:22.430]  This was...
[01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:24.310]  How many more pages?
[01:33:24.850 --> 01:33:26.190]  We have to go through the end.
[01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:29.270]  170 whatever. We can't stop.
[01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:30.090]  When does it end?
[01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:32.050]  It's like 203.
[01:33:32.530 --> 01:33:33.570]  Oh yeah, we can finish it out.
[01:33:34.770 --> 01:33:35.210]  290?
[01:33:36.130 --> 01:33:36.690]  Nevermind.
[01:33:37.370 --> 01:33:38.550]  Let's go to 200.
[01:33:38.630 --> 01:33:41.210]  This is 176.
[01:33:42.170 --> 01:33:43.450]  We got 25 more pages.
[01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:44.410]  It'll go fast.
[01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:46.650]  Wait a second.
[01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:49.670]  Mr. 98 all of a sudden wants to cut off
[01:33:49.670 --> 01:33:50.670]  98's stuff.
[01:33:51.170 --> 01:33:53.330]  I'm done with this.
[01:33:53.610 --> 01:33:55.290]  Dude, those fucking moon shoes
[01:33:55.290 --> 01:33:56.370]  were a thing for a little bit.
[01:33:57.050 --> 01:33:58.290]  Moon shoes were great.
[01:33:59.690 --> 01:34:01.370]  What the fuck is that?
[01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:02.750]  I don't know.
[01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:05.050]  Spinal Tap Hill.
[01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:06.870]  Bad gas
[01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:07.850]  baby human.
[01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.950]  Wow.
[01:34:11.450 --> 01:34:11.710]  Cool.
[01:34:12.630 --> 01:34:14.390]  Cars with eyes!
[01:34:17.190 --> 01:34:17.850]  How original!
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:22.590]  I was never into trucks
[01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:24.350]  or the construction stuff as a kid.
[01:34:24.670 --> 01:34:26.650]  That's just a phase I never went through.
[01:34:26.910 --> 01:34:28.530]  Remote control crane?
[01:34:28.930 --> 01:34:30.570]  Some kids had it so good.
[01:34:30.570 --> 01:34:31.250]  Oh yeah.
[01:34:33.150 --> 01:34:34.670]  That looks like it rolls.
[01:34:35.070 --> 01:34:35.210]  Yeah.
[01:34:36.010 --> 01:34:38.390]  You know, I didn't see any Transformers
[01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:39.470]  any G.I. Joe.
[01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:40.810]  I saw some Power Rangers.
[01:34:41.530 --> 01:34:44.630]  You did see a chainsaw that has real sounds.
[01:34:44.770 --> 01:34:46.310]  If you want to be a baby Leatherface
[01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:47.670]  you want to start young.
[01:34:48.230 --> 01:34:50.070]  He wanted it too. It was marked.
[01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:52.030]  It took us fucking...
[01:34:52.030 --> 01:34:52.990]  What page are we on now?
[01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:57.010]  182 pages to get to a Nerf gun.
[01:34:57.410 --> 01:34:57.530]  Yeah.
[01:34:57.530 --> 01:34:59.690]  We've had some Nerf in the past.
[01:34:59.790 --> 01:35:01.410]  Have we? Yeah, they're just scattered.
[01:35:01.970 --> 01:35:02.610]  Hot Wheels!
[01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:05.230]  Three loops?
[01:35:05.630 --> 01:35:06.110]  Madness!
[01:35:08.650 --> 01:35:09.730]  That's not safe.
[01:35:10.190 --> 01:35:10.470]  Uh-uh.
[01:35:10.730 --> 01:35:11.910]  Jack's Pacific?
[01:35:13.210 --> 01:35:15.410]  This is right before
[01:35:16.150 --> 01:35:18.010]  the figures got any good.
[01:35:18.270 --> 01:35:19.470]  These figures are terrible.
[01:35:20.190 --> 01:35:22.290]  Is that Andre?
[01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:24.470]  Yeah, under L.
[01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.850]  Yeah.
[01:35:25.370 --> 01:35:28.170]  I love that there's a little robot there.
[01:35:28.290 --> 01:35:29.990]  The Capsula MX Robo Master.
[01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:31.990]  And for his head, they just put the...
[01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:34.430]  They just cut the front of a 737 off
[01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:35.690]  and made it his face.
[01:35:40.450 --> 01:35:41.010]  Connect!
[01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:43.250]  The Lost Mines.
[01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:45.430]  Dude, those are so big.
[01:35:46.690 --> 01:35:47.630]  That's wild.
[01:35:48.090 --> 01:35:49.030]  That's the space.
[01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.770]  Right?
[01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:54.750]  Were you a big car guy, Nick, as a kid?
[01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:56.870]  No, but I like trains
[01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:58.110]  and I think I want to get...
[01:35:58.110 --> 01:35:59.590]  I like trains.
[01:36:01.410 --> 01:36:02.670]  Yeah, I want to get
[01:36:02.670 --> 01:36:04.750]  a train set that goes around my entire house.
[01:36:05.210 --> 01:36:07.070]  You'd be like Bobby Bacala.
[01:36:07.390 --> 01:36:07.570]  Yeah!
[01:36:08.570 --> 01:36:10.130]  There's no reason why you couldn't.
[01:36:10.410 --> 01:36:11.310]  There's nothing stopping you.
[01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:13.330]  Remote-controlled Sunrunner.
[01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:15.470]  There is the matter of my wife.
[01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:16.450]  Uh-huh.
[01:36:16.770 --> 01:36:19.650]  You want the Sunrunner, Gavin? Is that the one you were looking at?
[01:36:20.090 --> 01:36:20.450]  Yeah.
[01:36:20.710 --> 01:36:22.350]  Yeah, I'm a big Sunrunner guy right there, too.
[01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:25.150]  I think I'm a torpedo racing boat kind of man.
[01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:27.110]  Me and Gavin are...
[01:36:27.110 --> 01:36:28.990]  We're going on the high seas, but we're doing it in style.
[01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:30.250]  Geoff's just trying to get there fast.
[01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:33.410]  If you've got the torpedo racing boat,
[01:36:33.450 --> 01:36:34.950]  where are all the women going to sit?
[01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:36.610]  That's what I'm talking about!
[01:36:37.230 --> 01:36:39.650]  I'm going to jump my Nissan Frontier onto your boat.
[01:36:41.770 --> 01:36:42.690]  Ooh, you get a Humvee.
[01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:43.930]  Ooh!
[01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:46.070]  The tires, they float.
[01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:49.110]  What the fuck?
[01:36:49.730 --> 01:36:51.230]  We've entered into Nick's area.
[01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:52.930]  We're in Nick's territory now.
[01:36:53.250 --> 01:36:53.390]  Choo-choo!
[01:36:54.450 --> 01:36:56.190]  Oh, it's gone.
[01:36:57.070 --> 01:36:58.370]  I scouted a little bit ahead.
[01:36:58.710 --> 01:37:00.670]  Page 200 is a banger.
[01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.790]  Great page.
[01:37:02.430 --> 01:37:04.770]  Did you ever have the remote-controlled car called Rebound,
[01:37:04.990 --> 01:37:07.030]  which could flip upside down and drive the other way?
[01:37:07.110 --> 01:37:08.710]  I never had one, but I know what you're talking about.
[01:37:08.770 --> 01:37:10.410]  I know exactly what you're talking about.
[01:37:10.410 --> 01:37:11.550]  That thing was the shit.
[01:37:11.690 --> 01:37:13.870]  That was my big present when you loved it.
[01:37:13.970 --> 01:37:14.290]  That's awesome.
[01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:18.210]  So, I think the cool thing about this...
[01:37:18.210 --> 01:37:20.310]  I feel like this went really well, and I had a lot of fun doing it.
[01:37:20.370 --> 01:37:22.030]  And I think it'll be a lot of fun...
[01:37:22.030 --> 01:37:24.290]  I could see us doing this again in the future with other stuff.
[01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:24.690]  Yeah.
[01:37:26.190 --> 01:37:27.770]  Andrew and I have talked about this in the past.
[01:37:27.810 --> 01:37:29.550]  It would be fun to do it for our birth years.
[01:37:30.150 --> 01:37:31.270]  Ooh, that would be fun.
[01:37:31.970 --> 01:37:32.650]  It's a great idea.
[01:37:33.010 --> 01:37:34.830]  This is...
[01:37:34.830 --> 01:37:37.890]  You like a Digizord, or are you more of a Digimorpher guy?
[01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:40.030]  I was a Digizord guy.
[01:37:40.270 --> 01:37:42.010]  I don't know what those things are.
[01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:42.410]  Yeah, me neither.
[01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:45.050]  This is after my time with Power Rangers.
[01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:46.990]  Oh my god.
[01:37:47.630 --> 01:37:49.830]  This guy was all about the shit on this page.
[01:37:49.890 --> 01:37:51.590]  This guy's a Batman freak, bro.
[01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:52.790]  Oh, Godzilla!
[01:37:55.450 --> 01:37:56.530]  Oh, that's a pretty cool Godzilla.
[01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:57.490]  That is cool.
[01:37:57.550 --> 01:38:00.130]  Wait until 200. There's so much cool shit.
[01:38:00.250 --> 01:38:01.930]  The whole page is... Oh my god.
[01:38:02.370 --> 01:38:03.810]  Dude, there's a Death Star.
[01:38:03.990 --> 01:38:04.630]  Yeah, I saw that.
[01:38:04.630 --> 01:38:04.970]  That's me.
[01:38:07.250 --> 01:38:09.830]  Oh my god, you can pull Vader's helmet.
[01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:11.790]  Look, you can have a whole jizz band.
[01:38:12.070 --> 01:38:12.630]  You can get Yoda.
[01:38:13.890 --> 01:38:14.770]  You can get the Wampa.
[01:38:15.210 --> 01:38:17.150]  Yeah, you can get Figurine Dan.
[01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:19.550]  And then if you just get four more Figurine Dans,
[01:38:19.730 --> 01:38:20.810]  then you can have a jizz band.
[01:38:21.330 --> 01:38:23.490]  You can slice it open and hide in its thigh.
[01:38:23.810 --> 01:38:24.250]  Alright.
[01:38:25.290 --> 01:38:28.650]  Do you think George Lucas has changed all the faces under the Vader helmet?
[01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:29.350]  Yeah.
[01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:30.570]  They're all different now.
[01:38:31.050 --> 01:38:32.550]  But he's still stuck with jizz.
[01:38:33.310 --> 01:38:34.490]  Remove the eyebrows.
[01:38:35.450 --> 01:38:35.970]  Uh...
[01:38:35.970 --> 01:38:38.630]  Not mad at that Batman jet blade vehicle.
[01:38:38.770 --> 01:38:40.430]  That looks cool as shit.
[01:38:41.190 --> 01:38:41.950]  This is...
[01:38:41.950 --> 01:38:44.770]  I don't know what's up with this fucking freak guy over here, but he's having fun.
[01:38:45.090 --> 01:38:45.690]  Hey, I'm here.
[01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:46.870]  He's like waving.
[01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:49.490]  The kid who owned this...
[01:38:49.490 --> 01:38:50.550]  I think it's the Joker?
[01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:53.390]  The kid who owned this catalog...
[01:38:54.330 --> 01:38:56.490]  Really, really over indexed on Batman.
[01:38:59.650 --> 01:39:00.170]  $199.
[01:39:00.810 --> 01:39:01.910]  Ooh, X-Men.
[01:39:02.810 --> 01:39:03.730]  Cosmic power.
[01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:05.270]  14-inch Galactus.
[01:39:06.230 --> 01:39:07.990]  Did he ever show up in the cartoon?
[01:39:08.190 --> 01:39:08.610]  I don't remember.
[01:39:10.050 --> 01:39:10.590]  Galactus?
[01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:13.450]  In the Silver Surfer cartoon.
[01:39:14.170 --> 01:39:15.730]  That was the whole thing.
[01:39:16.330 --> 01:39:17.790]  There was an episode with
[01:39:17.790 --> 01:39:19.130]  Silver Surfer, I remember.
[01:39:20.630 --> 01:39:23.070]  Silver Surfer had his own thing.
[01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:24.450]  Here's Spider-Man's
[01:39:24.450 --> 01:39:25.750]  web blaster copter.
[01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:27.570]  You know, the classic copter that he uses.
[01:39:27.570 --> 01:39:28.270]  Yeah!
[01:39:30.250 --> 01:39:32.210]  Look at this shit!
[01:39:32.230 --> 01:39:33.470]  Oh, RoboCop!
[01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:34.690]  Holy shit!
[01:39:34.690 --> 01:39:37.650]  Look at how cool that helmet weapon arm thing is.
[01:39:38.130 --> 01:39:39.670]  Dude, what a great way to
[01:39:39.670 --> 01:39:41.610]  go out on fucking RoboCop.
[01:39:41.630 --> 01:39:43.470]  I've been playing that RoboCop game
[01:39:43.470 --> 01:39:44.310]  like fucking crazy.
[01:39:44.590 --> 01:39:47.570]  I love it. It's so fucking
[01:39:47.570 --> 01:39:49.250]  fun. What a fucking game.
[01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:51.610]  You gotta go... I'm sorry.
[01:39:51.730 --> 01:39:52.750]  One more page, Eric.
[01:39:52.850 --> 01:39:53.630]  To 201.
[01:39:55.390 --> 01:39:55.950]  Can
[01:39:55.950 --> 01:39:57.650]  we please get the six foot tall
[01:39:57.650 --> 01:39:58.570]  inflatable Godzilla?
[01:40:00.510 --> 01:40:01.390]  Oh my
[01:40:01.390 --> 01:40:01.890]  God.
[01:40:02.570 --> 01:40:05.250]  Also, a remote control
[01:40:05.250 --> 01:40:07.270]  fast attack Godzilla? This is
[01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:07.890]  incredible.
[01:40:08.770 --> 01:40:10.950]  It definitely looks like something we would have on set, right?
[01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:13.530]  They made Godzilla look
[01:40:13.530 --> 01:40:14.930]  so weird in that movie.
[01:40:15.710 --> 01:40:17.390]  Godzilla looked like shit in this
[01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:19.410]  stupid movie. And there's a new Godzilla
[01:40:19.410 --> 01:40:19.770]  movie?
[01:40:19.770 --> 01:40:21.830]  He kind of looks like
[01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:23.730]  H.R. Giger presents Godzilla.
[01:40:23.970 --> 01:40:25.150]  Yeah, kind of.
[01:40:26.050 --> 01:40:27.810]  Oh wow, one of Eric's favorite toys is on
[01:40:27.810 --> 01:40:30.050]  202. Oh, one of my favorite toys.
[01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:30.790]  Yeah, look.
[01:40:32.130 --> 01:40:33.090]  Small Soldiers!
[01:40:34.010 --> 01:40:34.930]  They're here!
[01:40:35.890 --> 01:40:37.390]  It's the Gorgonites!
[01:40:38.510 --> 01:40:39.770]  Oh, a chip figure
[01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:41.850]  for $24.99? What a deal.
[01:40:42.150 --> 01:40:44.090]  Wow. Shout out to Joe Dante.
[01:40:44.250 --> 01:40:45.330]  That guy knew kids.
[01:40:45.570 --> 01:40:48.130]  Alright, Geoff, take this fucking thing.
[01:40:48.130 --> 01:40:49.370]  Hey, thanks for
[01:40:49.370 --> 01:40:51.930]  going down this walk down memory lane
[01:40:51.930 --> 01:40:53.950]  with us as we round out and
[01:40:53.950 --> 01:40:55.930]  finish our final piece of
[01:40:55.930 --> 01:40:57.730]  1998 content.
[01:40:57.970 --> 01:41:00.190]  That's not to say that we won't come up with some other
[01:41:00.190 --> 01:41:02.130]  exciting piece of 1998 content
[01:41:02.130 --> 01:41:03.890]  in the future, but I believe this
[01:41:03.890 --> 01:41:05.550]  fulfills our own internal obligation
[01:41:06.190 --> 01:41:08.090]  of all the ideas that we had initially.
[01:41:08.410 --> 01:41:09.950]  We hope you enjoyed it. We hope
[01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:11.450]  you get some of these gifts for Christmas.
[01:41:12.610 --> 01:41:13.930]  If that's what you put the
[01:41:13.930 --> 01:41:15.730]  X next to. Hopefully
[01:41:15.730 --> 01:41:17.790]  you'll give some of these gifts for Christmas
[01:41:17.790 --> 01:41:19.830]  to people that matter to you in your life.
[01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:21.830]  Thanks for another year
[01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:23.790]  of listening to this
[01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:25.890]  dumbass podcast. We love you. Bye!
[01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.830]  Bye!
