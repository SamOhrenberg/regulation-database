[00:14.900 --> 00:24.820]  Hello, and welcome to the F*** Face Official Regulation Season 2 Supplemental Episode 1.
[00:25.400 --> 00:32.760]  This is coming out between Episode 76 and 77 of the F*** Face Podcast. It is important,
[00:33.100 --> 00:38.560]  Eric wants you to know this is not a half episode. This is Supplemental Episode 1 of
[00:38.560 --> 00:46.300]  Season 2 of F*** Face, as it appears between Episode 67 and Episode 77. My name is Geoff
[00:46.300 --> 00:52.600]  Ramsey and I am one of three hosts in this Supplemental Podcast. Gavin Free, you are
[00:52.600 --> 00:57.320]  also a host, as is Andrew Panton, who could not be here physically because he lives in
[00:57.320 --> 01:02.420]  Canada and for him to go anywhere it takes 17 days. And that's not pandemic related,
[01:02.420 --> 01:09.040]  that's just his issues. Also, we have Nick and Eric, sound engineer extraordinaire and
[01:09.040 --> 01:16.520]  producer. Today, we will be exploring the flavors of the new Cosmic Crisp Apple. Just
[01:16.520 --> 01:23.620]  came out yesterday, November 8th, 2021. Brand new Apple dropped, hit the streets. Everybody's
[01:23.620 --> 01:26.500]  talking about it. Now we're going to taste it. Hello, guys.
[01:26.500 --> 01:32.560]  I've learned... this feels like the first time that we've tested out all of us doing
[01:32.560 --> 01:38.000]  this podcast in a room, but Andrew's not here. And I've learned three things already. Geoff
[01:38.000 --> 01:43.640]  is all about his arms when he's talking. Eric facepalms a lot. And Andrew doesn't get a
[01:43.640 --> 01:49.620]  word in at all. I mean, it's not... it's just... this is...
[01:49.620 --> 01:56.100]  I don't know why we're doing this. To be fair, this is my fault. I wasn't listening when
[01:56.100 --> 02:00.520]  this was agreed upon. I don't really know what this is. I don't know why we're doing
[02:00.520 --> 02:07.260]  it. But I don't know why are we doing this outside of an episode? Why would we do it
[02:07.260 --> 02:11.260]  because we're trying to be timely? Because we want to hit when the apples hit, man. Apples
[02:11.260 --> 02:15.800]  are hot right now. Never timely. We've never been first time for everything. This is also
[02:15.800 --> 02:21.520]  the first time we've ever been here and ready to go for a worldwide global apple drop.
[02:21.520 --> 02:27.100]  This shit doesn't happen all the time, man. I'm aware and we is a strong word. We is a
[02:27.100 --> 02:31.260]  strong word for this. For this apple experience. You had more than a week to figure out how
[02:31.260 --> 02:34.940]  to get an apple in your hand. It's true. I couldn't get one. What are you fucking...
[02:34.940 --> 02:40.520]  I can't grow a tree in a week. What are you talking... We didn't grow trees, dude. Eric
[02:40.520 --> 02:45.520]  didn't say, all right, everybody go home and grow a fucking apple tree. No. Oh, no. He
[02:46.040 --> 02:52.480]  posted a link with more online stores for the US. You're the fucking apple guy. You should
[02:52.480 --> 02:57.320]  have apples coming out of your ears, dude. Come on. I even suggested get a Honeycrisp
[02:57.320 --> 03:02.560]  at an enterprise in Frankenstein and Apple together. Even that wasn't possible for Andrew.
[03:03.120 --> 03:08.120]  Listen, I tried. I looked everywhere. I even tried to buy a fucking enterprise tree. Couldn't
[03:08.120 --> 03:12.300]  get it in time. Couldn't find one that would ship it to me. No wonder you're so obsessed
[03:12.300 --> 03:17.380]  with apples. Canada is the Sahara Desert of apples. There's an apple drought. You can't
[03:17.380 --> 03:21.040]  get one when you see it. Everybody on the street probably stops to look at it. They're like,
[03:21.060 --> 03:25.700]  oh my God, it's the apple. We don't get those in Canada. They're impossible to find. You looked
[03:25.700 --> 03:34.320]  for an enterprise tree? You didn't just like... Well, no, I looked for the apple first and the
[03:34.320 --> 03:37.960]  only thing I could find were trees. And I was just like, well, it'd be kind of funny if I bought
[03:37.960 --> 03:42.240]  a tree. I don't want to get back into these. No, you don't have to. Geoff, tell me about the cosmic
[03:42.240 --> 03:47.360]  crisp. Y'all got me yelling again. Okay, here we go. I thought I was in not in the yelling phase
[03:47.360 --> 03:53.220]  of the face anymore. Don't forget to bleep that one. Cosmic crisp, infinite possibilities. The
[03:53.220 --> 03:59.320]  classically bred cross between an enterprise and a honey crisp apple. Neither of those apples are
[03:59.320 --> 04:02.680]  available in the country of Canada. Obviously, neither is the cosmic crisp. Unfortunately,
[04:03.060 --> 04:11.280]  0 for 3 on good apples is Canada. Not available to Andrew. Here's a couple of facts. I have some
[04:11.280 --> 04:15.600]  in my pocket. The cosmic crisp apple. Well, do you have a, are you a Star Trek fan? Do you have
[04:15.600 --> 04:19.140]  an enterprise like a Star Trek Enterprise? Maybe you put together as a kid or something. Can you
[04:19.140 --> 04:24.200]  stick that on an apple? No. Okay. The cosmic crisp apple is the remarkably delicious result of 20
[04:24.200 --> 04:29.020]  years of study and research by Washington State University's world class, according to them,
[04:29.380 --> 04:36.560]  tree fruit breeding program. Cosmic crisp R, it's a registered name, has an exceptional flavor
[04:36.560 --> 04:41.100]  profile. We will see about that. The cosmic, they've been blowing a lot of flavor profile
[04:41.100 --> 04:45.640]  up our ass and we're going to see today if it holds up. Cosmic crisp is a one apple that is
[04:45.640 --> 04:52.980]  equally delicious whole sliced or in cooking and baking. I don't know about that. There are about a
[04:52.980 --> 04:58.060]  hundred calories in one medium cosmic crisp brand apple. I don't know how that compares to other
[04:58.060 --> 05:02.380]  apples, which is why cosmic crisp apples are a perfect snack. You guys know what the traditional
[05:02.380 --> 05:06.120]  calorie count of an apple is? No. Medium sized apple? I don't either. Well, I don't understand
[05:06.120 --> 05:13.500]  how a sliced apple could taste different to a regular whole apple. Oxidization, right? There's
[05:13.500 --> 05:21.420]  a lot of words here that are just explaining apples as a concept. I'm not done. The apple
[05:21.420 --> 05:26.460]  has been, and I'd like to point out, we are not sponsored by the Washington Apple Commission in
[05:26.460 --> 05:30.580]  any way whatsoever. We had to buy these apples with our own hard earned apple money. The apple
[05:30.580 --> 05:35.620]  has been high. Oh my God. Don't peak, dude. We're unboxing. The apple has been highly rated for its
[05:35.620 --> 05:39.720]  sweet, tangy flavor. Andrew knows a little something about that. It has exceptional storability.
[05:39.880 --> 05:45.260]  Andrew also knows about that. The fruit ripens in late September, is large round conical with
[05:45.260 --> 05:52.060]  90 to 100% of the surface covered in a rich and purple color over a green yellow background. Since
[05:52.060 --> 05:57.680]  apples are mostly made up of water, they have a low calorie density, meaning there aren't a lot of
[05:57.680 --> 06:03.540]  calories in apples yet. They are still filling. They're fat, sodium and cholesterol free. You
[06:04.240 --> 06:09.080]  I'm not reading the back. That's what we need to know about this. How many apples we got,
[06:09.240 --> 06:13.760]  Eric? What are we gonna do with them? We have... Oh no, go ahead, Andrew. Is this real? I don't
[06:13.760 --> 06:17.660]  understand what kind of question that is. Wait, are we recording, you mean? No, like, well wait,
[06:17.740 --> 06:22.420]  am I recording? Actually, that's a great question. I was not. What the fuck? I was not. I was not
[06:22.420 --> 06:29.260]  recording. Hit record now. Are you new? Or is this your first episode? No, listen, I was very much
[06:29.260 --> 06:33.360]  caught off guard by this. He's like, what is this podcast? I wasn't paying attention the last 76
[06:33.360 --> 06:42.780]  episodes. Nick and I were really deep in other food talk, and I'm kind of... Why'd you throw Nick
[06:42.780 --> 06:49.340]  under the bus? Well, I don't feel like I was. This is explaining what happened. Apple podcast,
[06:50.280 --> 06:56.060]  guys. I know we're an Apple podcast. I am the Apple guy on this Apple podcast. I disagree with
[06:56.060 --> 06:59.760]  that. Yeah. I don't think you can hold that title. You weren't even around for the Apple
[06:59.760 --> 07:03.060]  conversation over the weekend. Now, I don't want to get into that. By the way, see, this is a
[07:03.060 --> 07:09.200]  dangerous thing. I got to be careful because the goal from the start has always been, has always
[07:09.200 --> 07:14.740]  been... I talk with my hands. We've performed together for a thousand fucking years. We've
[07:14.740 --> 07:19.300]  done a million podcasts before this one. How do you not know I talk with my hands? We never sat
[07:19.300 --> 07:22.820]  next to each other. It's just under my face. I'm emphatic. We've done Off Topic together
[07:22.820 --> 07:26.580]  one million times. We've done the RT podcast. I think we're doing the RT podcast together Monday,
[07:26.760 --> 07:30.060]  dude. I thought you weren't going to yell anymore on this podcast. I can't help it.
[07:30.060 --> 07:35.520]  Okay. I don't even know what I was talking about. Are you ready? Are you ready for the
[07:35.520 --> 07:40.420]  Cosmic Crisp reveal? Yes. Yeah. This is... Andrew, you can't see, but I'll show you a video later.
[07:40.440 --> 07:51.080]  Can we get a drumroll? Oh, shit. Oh, it looks like an apple. Yeah, it looks like a...
[07:51.080 --> 07:54.580]  100% what I thought when I opened the box and I just went, oh, these are just apples.
[07:54.780 --> 07:59.580]  Doesn't even look... they're not even shiny, really. It's kind of a muted foam cutouts for
[07:59.580 --> 08:05.580]  the stems. It's kind of a muted apple. Sort of a flat, like a matte apple. Like it's a matte apple
[08:05.580 --> 08:11.000]  or maybe like eggshell apple. At best, it's eggshell. How's your apple, Andrew? How's it look?
[08:12.360 --> 08:16.920]  I don't... this is a bit. This is all a bit the fuck with me. This is you're doing... we're
[08:16.920 --> 08:21.260]  reviewing a thing I can't eat and this whole segment is describing a thing you're not letting
[08:21.260 --> 08:26.340]  me see. Do you want us to... Oh, yeah, that's good. That works. FaceTime you and... Hey,
[08:26.340 --> 08:31.340]  dummy, look. I got a box of apples. Oh, there we go. Okay, now I'm in. Now I'm back. Oh, good.
[08:31.480 --> 08:37.100]  Hey, hey, Geoff. Andrew's in. Those are some... I'm back in now. Oh, good. Well, I'm just looking
[08:37.100 --> 08:40.940]  at a Discord chat by myself listening to you describe apples. Let me go full screen.
[08:41.760 --> 08:44.780]  That's what the audience is doing. Yeah, what do you think the podcast is?
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.200]  You know, it sucks to not see what is happening with this fucking Discord thing.
[08:52.280 --> 08:57.020]  Anyway, just let me go full screen. No, anyway, I'm going to let you guys select your apple.
[08:57.940 --> 09:02.680]  Swearing in the back. Go ahead and select your apple, Gavin. Now, Andrew, who's... Okay, wait,
[09:02.800 --> 09:09.900]  who's picking? I think I'm going to go for 1A. Gavin in the top corner. This looks the glossiest.
[09:09.960 --> 09:15.420]  It is. It's a gloss. They're all pretty glossy. This one, very matte. Yeah. Now, Andrew, I need
[09:15.420 --> 09:20.060]  to select an apple. And I'd like as an apple expert, I'm a bit of an apple novice. I did just
[09:20.060 --> 09:23.960]  an apple weekend. I don't want to talk about it here because it's not official podcast content.
[09:24.600 --> 09:28.360]  This is supplemental content, and we only talk about supplemental things. I don't want the
[09:28.360 --> 09:34.160]  podcast to bleed into the supplemental content. We know that. However, I'm curious as an apple
[09:35.080 --> 09:39.420]  enthusiast, but relatively new, would you help me pick out an apple? Do I want to go for
[09:39.780 --> 09:45.560]  sized? Do I want to go for dark, light, sheen? Or we could do claw game. You say left and right.
[09:45.560 --> 09:50.140]  Oh, we could do claw game. I don't want to help you at all. To be completely honest,
[09:50.280 --> 09:55.600]  I feel like you've been trying to come for my fucking apple throne, and I feel like there's
[09:55.600 --> 10:00.780]  clearly a bullshit apple. There's two of them that I can see. Maybe more. There's like three
[10:00.780 --> 10:04.280]  bullshit in that box. Pick his apple. And I feel like you're going to grab it. Pick the apple,
[10:04.400 --> 10:08.020]  and then I'll pick the one you want. You're controlling my hand, Andrew. Go for it. No,
[10:08.180 --> 10:12.240]  I'm not controlling anything. I'm letting you pick your apple and exposing yourself as the
[10:12.720 --> 10:16.980]  apple person that you are. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to close my eyes,
[10:17.120 --> 10:21.640]  and I want you to spin the box around, and I'm just going to grab the first apple. There's no
[10:21.640 --> 10:25.640]  way I can pick a bullshit apple intentionally. Nick, you're going to verify my... I'm not even
[10:25.640 --> 10:32.400]  looking. Your soul will be guided to the bad apple. Okay, we're moving it. We're moving it.
[10:32.560 --> 10:35.920]  Okay. I have no idea what's going on. Whenever you're ready. You just put your hand in. Okay,
[10:35.980 --> 10:40.780]  which one? I don't know. You're touching all of them. Great job. I'm going to touch this one. I
[10:40.780 --> 10:47.880]  got my apple. Ah, fuck. That was a good apple. He got a good one. Way to go. Fuck. Oh, I got
[10:47.880 --> 10:54.180]  number 3507. What number are you? 3507. That must be the batch. That must be the batch number. Okay,
[10:54.260 --> 10:58.680]  I'm going to save. Well, first, I'm going to save my immediate impressions. This is a very spherical
[10:58.680 --> 11:03.180]  apple. Yeah, it's very nice and round. It's a tall. Mine's a tall apple. Are you saving? Are
[11:03.180 --> 11:06.560]  you putting your sticker on your wallet? I'm going to put my sticker on my driver's license. On your
[11:06.960 --> 11:10.340]  driver's license? I have it in my wallet. It's protected. I know where it is. I'm going to put
[11:10.340 --> 11:19.460]  mine on my green card. That's a good idea. Do you guys spin your stem out? I'm going to do that
[11:19.460 --> 11:27.000]  too. Andrew, is this a good one? Yeah, that's a good apple. Look at how long and straight my stem
[11:27.000 --> 11:33.260]  is. That's a good stem. I'll put my sticker on my blockbuster card. Now, what do you do with your
[11:33.260 --> 11:38.400]  apple stem, Andrew? You throw that away, I guess? You don't save it as a memento? There was a period
[11:38.400 --> 11:56.720]  of time in which I was eating the entirety of the apple. Even the stem? Even the stem. The core and
[11:56.720 --> 12:03.340]  everything. Now, does the stem and the core, do they have nutrients? I don't know. It was hardcore
[12:03.340 --> 12:07.180]  and it was easier. I didn't want to get up in the middle of class and find the garbage can,
[12:07.180 --> 12:10.760]  so I just ate the whole apple. My issue with apples is very little to describe it. I'm sniffing
[12:10.760 --> 12:14.160]  it and thinking it smells exactly like an apple. How tall is your apple? Who's got a taller apple?
[12:14.580 --> 12:20.380]  Oh, I don't think it's me. I have a thinner apple. My apple doesn't stand straight. It's a little on
[12:20.380 --> 12:26.360]  the piss. Oh, nice. Nick says that apple seeds contain arsenic. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well,
[12:28.020 --> 12:29.980]  you don't want to eat them in large quantities. Yeah, I mean, you just said you eat the whole
[12:29.980 --> 12:34.880]  thing, so it's fine. I get it. He's a wonder he's alive. I will say the sticker residue, awful.
[12:34.880 --> 12:38.040]  Look at that. Are you seeing that? I had some sticker residue I had to spin off.
[12:38.260 --> 12:43.140]  Yeah, there you go. All right. Should we... Let's take a crack in. Now,
[12:43.300 --> 12:47.720]  do you take a vertical bite or a horizontal bite? I'm a horizontal guy. I'm a sideways bite guy.
[12:48.060 --> 12:52.900]  Sideways bite guy? Nick's a vertical guy. Wow, crazy. I've always gone like that. Gavin's vertical.
[12:53.080 --> 12:58.120]  Interesting. Andrew, you have to break it. Yeah, break the tie. Are you a horizontal or a vertical
[12:58.120 --> 13:03.520]  bite? Oh, vertical. Vertical always. I feel like you want to upper teeth the ridge. Yeah,
[13:03.520 --> 13:08.940]  you want to go on the top. Exactly. Yeah. All right, here we go. Interesting. The cosmic
[13:08.940 --> 13:19.400]  crisp bite test. Let's do it. Well, I'm definitely not going to throw it against the room. That's
[13:19.400 --> 13:24.680]  your bulk standard apple. That is the most apple tasting apple I've ever had. Well, wait,
[13:24.740 --> 13:29.540]  what does that mean? What type? Are we on the more tart side? What's the texture like? It's
[13:29.540 --> 13:35.920]  a little tart. It's more tart than a regular red apple. Very mild. Very mild. A little sweet.
[13:36.560 --> 13:45.100]  Is it tarter than an Envy? I don't know what that is. Nick says yes. I'll say it's juicy.
[13:45.420 --> 13:50.700]  It is. It's full of juice. This would make a lot of apple juice, this apple. This is just showing
[13:50.700 --> 13:54.960]  me that apples are just not interesting fruits. No. I mean, it's fine. It's a good apple, but
[13:54.960 --> 14:01.820]  it's good. I got no issue. That is... it's a terrible take. I don't know that this is better
[14:01.820 --> 14:10.020]  than a good banana, but this is a good apple. What are you doing? What a bite. That exploded.
[14:10.520 --> 14:15.780]  Oh, wow. Get a big bite in. Okay. Okay. Oh.
[14:17.220 --> 14:25.400]  You get more of the bouquet. It's voluminous. That's a great way to describe it.
[14:27.700 --> 14:28.840]  Gavin's got apple jizz.
[14:31.820 --> 14:39.120]  What the fuck? Are you okay? What is that noise? Were you laughing at my shorts?
[14:39.640 --> 14:45.620]  Yeah, there's so much juice. It's a juicy apple. It's a very juicy apple.
[14:46.720 --> 14:52.080]  I don't... That's great. I don't care for it. We don't like this. It's fine.
[14:52.540 --> 14:57.020]  Yeah, Andrew, you go ahead. Yeah, I was gonna say, what type of apples do you enjoy?
[14:57.020 --> 15:03.940]  I like a red apple. I don't like tart in my apple. I like a lot of sweet. To me,
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.860]  it's a very sweet fruit. And to get the tartness, I kind of like... I don't enjoy it.
[15:07.940 --> 15:10.460]  You must hate Granny Smith, then. I have no idea.
[15:10.580 --> 15:15.320]  I would say most people... Eric, I'm gonna guess you align with most people
[15:16.320 --> 15:20.660]  who would separate apples into two categories, red and green, right?
[15:21.900 --> 15:25.800]  Okay. Yeah, I feel similar. I like red. I don't like green.
[15:26.300 --> 15:28.000]  I like green apple candy.
[15:28.320 --> 15:33.040]  Me too, but this is too green-tasting to be red. It's so red on the outside,
[15:33.160 --> 15:36.780]  but so green-tasting on the inside. It is greener on the inside than the red
[15:36.780 --> 15:39.700]  color. So, Andrew, do you feel like you're really missing out watching us eat all these apples?
[15:40.480 --> 15:45.280]  I'm not only missing out, I'm being pained by the most average apple takes I've ever heard.
[15:45.380 --> 15:49.920]  This is clearly a clueless apple room. It's average. It takes for an average apple.
[15:50.520 --> 15:52.560]  I wanted to have my dick blown off by those apples.
[15:52.560 --> 15:55.140]  Me too. I really thought it was gonna taste like candy.
[15:55.140 --> 16:00.160]  I wanted to get a Cosmic Crisp tattoo, be like the world's biggest Cosmic Crisp stand. It's okay.
[16:00.460 --> 16:05.760]  If I started making this, breeding this, in 1997, and then all these years later I said,
[16:06.200 --> 16:09.180]  fruits of my labor, and it just tasted like this apple, I'd be like,
[16:09.400 --> 16:11.040]  yeah, can't do it. You wasted your time.
[16:11.240 --> 16:15.440]  Yeah, 20 years to get this, a thing that I could just go to the store and get.
[16:15.440 --> 16:16.520]  We already have it.
[16:17.400 --> 16:21.080]  Well, now, I think some of the benefits are right that it keeps a long time.
[16:21.080 --> 16:26.180]  You know, it is very, like, the meaty inside is not oxidizing at all.
[16:26.440 --> 16:28.740]  Like, at all, at all. And they've been open for a minute.
[16:30.080 --> 16:33.740]  It's very big. These are big apples.
[16:34.060 --> 16:36.220]  I wonder if this is considered a medium size.
[16:36.260 --> 16:38.640]  That's what they, I think that's what they send us is a set.
[16:38.640 --> 16:41.840]  I will say it's only 100 calories here. I'd hate to see a large one.
[16:42.060 --> 16:43.720]  I mean, that's an, what is it, 120?
[16:47.120 --> 16:49.940]  Geoff just held up his hand, it's like the size of a pumpkin.
[16:50.660 --> 16:52.700]  It might be one of the biggest apples I've ever eaten.
[16:54.860 --> 16:57.000]  How many calories...
[16:57.000 --> 16:57.900]  I skipped lunch for this.
[16:57.960 --> 16:59.780]  ... in a large...
[17:02.040 --> 17:03.980]  That really tickled Nick.
[17:04.880 --> 17:06.560]  A large apple is 116.
[17:08.640 --> 17:09.140]  116.
[17:09.660 --> 17:09.920]  Wow.
[17:10.580 --> 17:14.120]  It's a good snack. What's a banana? Probably more though, because it's dense.
[17:14.800 --> 17:16.420]  How many calories in a large banana?
[17:18.960 --> 17:19.680]  Um, 121.
[17:20.220 --> 17:23.320]  I'll say this. I will say this for the Cosmic Crisp.
[17:23.680 --> 17:25.360]  One of the things that's a turn off to me on apples,
[17:25.740 --> 17:28.720]  is I find the skin to be annoying in my mouth sometimes.
[17:28.860 --> 17:30.560]  Like it gets stuck around and pokey.
[17:31.120 --> 17:33.460]  I got no skin problems with this apple. The skin is fine.
[17:33.860 --> 17:36.100]  Banana guy is going to talk about texture. Fascinating.
[17:36.660 --> 17:37.920]  I'm talking about texture, I'm talking about skin.
[17:38.300 --> 17:42.520]  And I also said, I also said that this was a positive for this fucking apple.
[17:42.580 --> 17:43.740]  I was complimenting this apple.
[17:43.840 --> 17:44.720]  You can't please him today.
[17:45.380 --> 17:47.480]  What's the difference between texture and skin?
[17:48.100 --> 17:49.080]  Isn't it the same thing?
[17:49.500 --> 17:50.680]  Well, he was just saying about how...
[17:50.680 --> 17:50.980]  It's feel.
[17:51.260 --> 17:52.260]  You know, I'm going to go deeper.
[17:52.400 --> 17:55.680]  I want to see if there's a gradient to the flavor and go towards the center.
[17:55.860 --> 17:56.340]  That's nice. Good.
[17:57.040 --> 18:03.440]  I will say, I think the middle is tart, more tart than like the top and the bottom.
[18:03.600 --> 18:06.400]  It's like the different flavors of a jawbreaker as you get closer to the middle.
[18:06.420 --> 18:06.600]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:07.060 --> 18:07.900]  Gotta eat some of the seeds.
[18:07.900 --> 18:08.280]  It looks delicious.
[18:08.460 --> 18:09.060]  I ate the glue.
[18:09.380 --> 18:11.620]  Oh, that's fun. Was that, did that help?
[18:12.760 --> 18:14.680]  I think if I had a, I don't like bananas.
[18:14.840 --> 18:17.340]  And I think if I had a choice between this and a banana, I'd choose a banana.
[18:18.380 --> 18:20.100]  That's how like underwhelming this apple is.
[18:20.700 --> 18:23.240]  This is just when Gavin says bog standard apple.
[18:23.420 --> 18:26.020]  Yeah, I feel like it's not underwhelming for an apple.
[18:26.160 --> 18:28.280]  It's just an apple is underwhelming by default.
[18:28.420 --> 18:30.220]  And there's only so good that it can be.
[18:31.160 --> 18:31.800]  I'll say this.
[18:31.900 --> 18:32.680]  I think it tastes very strange.
[18:33.420 --> 18:33.800]  Tastes new.
[18:33.880 --> 18:35.080]  It does. It does taste new.
[18:35.320 --> 18:36.280]  This tastes like a new apple.
[18:36.740 --> 18:38.260]  It doesn't taste like it was built in the 90s.
[18:38.340 --> 18:39.660]  Two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[18:39.760 --> 18:40.860]  What we can do with eight more apples?
[18:41.320 --> 18:42.180]  That's all that's here.
[18:42.280 --> 18:43.420]  I'll take, I'll take one.
[18:43.860 --> 18:45.020]  How? What about um...
[18:45.020 --> 18:46.220]  Let's hit him with a baseball bat.
[18:46.620 --> 18:48.560]  What about scrump entrapment?
[18:48.660 --> 18:50.240]  I have baseball bats in the back of my car.
[18:51.060 --> 18:51.360]  Do you really?
[18:51.580 --> 18:51.860]  I do.
[18:51.980 --> 18:52.380]  Let's do one.
[18:52.420 --> 18:53.780]  We could do that. Or what if we did uh...
[18:53.780 --> 18:55.280]  If we slow-mo it for the promo...
[18:55.280 --> 18:55.460]  Okay.
[18:55.620 --> 18:55.880]  Boom!
[18:55.920 --> 18:56.700]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[18:56.760 --> 18:57.380]  Yeah, we'll do it outside.
[18:57.600 --> 18:57.780]  Okay.
[18:59.280 --> 19:02.520]  Those videos we used to do in video games called bum bait,
[19:02.740 --> 19:05.600]  where you would put somebody and stand with somebody in the corner
[19:05.600 --> 19:07.380]  and then they would go up to melee them
[19:07.380 --> 19:08.800]  and then you would run around from behind them
[19:08.800 --> 19:09.920]  and shoot them in the butt with a shotgun.
[19:09.920 --> 19:11.820]  What if we bum baited with apples?
[19:12.240 --> 19:13.620]  We stuck them around the office
[19:13.620 --> 19:15.260]  and then when somebody goes up to try to get them,
[19:15.520 --> 19:16.800]  we hit them in the back with a baseball bat.
[19:17.240 --> 19:19.080]  Your idea is to hit someone with a baseball bat?
[19:19.400 --> 19:21.360]  From behind. They'll never know who it was.
[19:21.420 --> 19:21.680]  Oh.
[19:21.980 --> 19:22.900]  I feel like we should just see...
[19:22.900 --> 19:26.340]  I feel like we should just see who is a scrumper by nature.
[19:26.520 --> 19:28.880]  See who scrumps, just put them up in the trees.
[19:29.160 --> 19:30.680]  Scrumber by nature, not because I hate you.
[19:33.000 --> 19:34.000]  Andrew, did you like that?
[19:34.680 --> 19:37.420]  I will never not be convinced that this wasn't
[19:37.420 --> 19:39.360]  completely designed to just fuck with me.
[19:39.920 --> 19:41.680]  We're in at the time, Apple's not through.
[19:43.100 --> 19:45.700]  I'm trying to get on board with your interests.
[19:45.960 --> 19:47.840]  I'm wearing an Apple shirt today, dude.
[19:47.840 --> 19:49.180]  It's true, he is wearing an Apple shirt.
[19:49.740 --> 19:50.400]  I appreciate...
[19:51.480 --> 19:52.280]  I appreciate...
[19:52.280 --> 19:53.900]  Yeah, no, I appreciate the Apple content.
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.440]  I flew to Detroit to go to a cider mill
[19:57.440 --> 19:59.380]  just to immerse myself in your world.
[19:59.440 --> 20:01.000]  I can't believe you're so annoyed today.
[20:01.140 --> 20:03.240]  This is, see, I don't want to get supplemental content.
[20:03.460 --> 20:04.800]  I don't want to get main channel content on something,
[20:04.940 --> 20:07.200]  but I spent a whole day giving you Apple content
[20:07.200 --> 20:09.800]  and you ignored it and turned your fucking phone off
[20:09.800 --> 20:10.220]  by the way.
[20:10.320 --> 20:11.380]  I was pretty excited about it.
[20:11.440 --> 20:11.920]  I liked it all.
[20:11.980 --> 20:12.420]  Thank you, Eric.
[20:12.500 --> 20:13.620]  You were on board.
[20:13.700 --> 20:14.160]  I appreciate it.
[20:14.220 --> 20:15.600]  And Gavin, you shared your sandwiches.
[20:15.880 --> 20:16.560]  I went pastrami.
[20:16.900 --> 20:18.480]  Andrew just gave me two middle fingers.
[20:19.040 --> 20:21.820]  I'm just going to quickly summarize what has happened here.
[20:22.380 --> 20:23.660]  We are reviewing...
[20:23.660 --> 20:27.320]  I have been vocally the only person that thinks an Apple is above average.
[20:27.420 --> 20:28.840]  I think it's the best fruit available.
[20:29.300 --> 20:32.980]  We are reviewing a specific Apple I cannot eat.
[20:33.240 --> 20:37.580]  I'm just watching a bunch of people who think Apple is at best average
[20:37.580 --> 20:39.380]  eating my favorite fruit
[20:39.380 --> 20:42.960]  and then they're going to smash the rest of them with a fucking baseball bat.
[20:43.060 --> 20:45.020]  Well, what you want is to get the Apple.
[20:45.300 --> 20:45.920]  Get hold of one.
[20:46.100 --> 20:46.560]  I can't.
[20:46.700 --> 20:47.560]  I'd love to.
[20:47.840 --> 20:49.240]  I'd absolutely love to.
[20:49.340 --> 20:49.840]  You're an Apple quitter.
[20:49.860 --> 20:50.700]  They look great.
[20:51.420 --> 20:52.180]  I've got no words.
[20:52.300 --> 20:53.520]  This is all designed as a...
[20:53.520 --> 20:53.960]  This is a...
[20:53.960 --> 20:54.380]  I don't know.
[20:54.660 --> 20:55.440]  This is a prank.
[20:55.640 --> 20:55.880]  Okay.
[20:56.020 --> 20:57.300]  You're fucking with me in some way.
[20:57.580 --> 20:58.660]  We got to wrap this up, right?
[20:58.820 --> 20:59.060]  Yeah.
[20:59.280 --> 21:00.860]  This says that it's great for...
[21:00.860 --> 21:02.580]  It says that it's great for fresh salad...
[21:02.580 --> 21:04.240]  Fresh salads and in beverages.
[21:04.660 --> 21:06.340]  Oh, how would it do in a pastrami sandwich?
[21:06.860 --> 21:08.340]  You know, with the tartness...
[21:08.340 --> 21:09.080]  A nice slice.
[21:09.200 --> 21:09.360]  Yeah.
[21:09.380 --> 21:11.140]  It makes for a floral burp.
[21:11.220 --> 21:11.400]  You know what?
[21:11.400 --> 21:11.960]  I'll tell you that.
[21:12.080 --> 21:13.400]  I'm going to take one for lunch.
[21:13.560 --> 21:14.240]  You should take...
[21:14.240 --> 21:14.800]  You put...
[21:14.800 --> 21:15.780]  It's going to be my sandwich, Apple.
[21:15.940 --> 21:16.960]  Please take pics.
[21:18.120 --> 21:22.260]  Okay, well, I think we should go around the room and then leave our final Apple impressions.
[21:22.440 --> 21:25.580]  Let's do on a face scale of one to ten.
[21:25.660 --> 21:25.880]  Okay.
[21:26.060 --> 21:30.060]  Ten being like the best Apple on Earth.
[21:30.220 --> 21:30.380]  Right.
[21:30.660 --> 21:33.800]  One being the worst Apple on Earth.
[21:34.600 --> 21:39.760]  Gavin, where do you rate the Cosmic Crisp based on the 75% of the Apple that you've eaten thus far?
[21:41.280 --> 21:42.000]  What's the scale?
[21:42.240 --> 21:43.080]  We doing numbers?
[21:43.680 --> 21:45.140]  Are you Andrew?
[21:51.100 --> 21:52.860]  Am I being pranked, Phil?
[21:53.500 --> 21:56.500]  I was making eye contact when I told you the fucking thing.
[21:56.700 --> 21:58.280]  I was looking right at you.
[21:58.420 --> 21:59.340]  You were looking at me.
[21:59.540 --> 22:02.020]  I told you what the fucking scale was and why.
[22:02.400 --> 22:03.280]  Let me be honest with you.
[22:03.280 --> 22:06.920]  I went back just back then when I did a little Apple burp and I threw up.
[22:10.020 --> 22:11.120]  One to ten, guy.
[22:12.140 --> 22:13.100]  Hey, hold on.
[22:13.480 --> 22:16.000]  How's an Apple burp puke?
[22:16.740 --> 22:18.100]  It was just tastes like Apple.
[22:18.440 --> 22:19.460]  It was just like the last bit.
[22:19.480 --> 22:20.320]  It just came back up.
[22:20.900 --> 22:21.920]  One to ten.
[22:22.440 --> 22:22.800]  Six.
[22:23.820 --> 22:24.180]  Six.
[22:24.420 --> 22:26.320]  And how would you rate apples in general?
[22:26.600 --> 22:26.640]  Six.
[22:26.880 --> 22:28.200]  So you think it's a bog standard Apple?
[22:28.360 --> 22:28.760]  It's just an Apple.
[22:28.960 --> 22:29.320]  It's just that.
[22:29.560 --> 22:31.520]  No better or worse than any other Apple you've ever.
[22:31.520 --> 22:32.720]  I would do apples like this.
[22:32.720 --> 22:34.320]  Every Apple is a six out of ten.
[22:35.440 --> 22:36.360]  Including this one.
[22:36.480 --> 22:39.160]  Except to Granny Smith, which is six and a half.
[22:40.060 --> 22:40.460]  Eric?
[22:41.760 --> 22:42.940]  Not a big...
[22:42.940 --> 22:43.860]  I mean, apples are fine.
[22:43.920 --> 22:45.220]  I don't have anything for or against them.
[22:45.260 --> 22:46.900]  I feel like sometimes they give me indigestion.
[22:47.940 --> 22:49.880]  I think they're just okay.
[22:50.160 --> 22:50.480]  Five.
[22:50.640 --> 22:52.580]  Like every other Apple I've ever eaten that's red.
[22:52.880 --> 22:53.860]  Andrew's gonna be livid.
[22:55.340 --> 22:56.140]  Nick, five.
[22:56.260 --> 22:57.340]  Total middle of the road.
[22:57.880 --> 22:58.700]  There are better apples.
[22:58.800 --> 22:59.460]  There are worse apples.
[22:59.680 --> 22:59.860]  Okay.
[23:00.920 --> 23:02.400]  What's a better Apple to you?
[23:02.720 --> 23:03.640]  And where would it rank?
[23:03.940 --> 23:04.480]  Envy Apple.
[23:05.020 --> 23:05.920]  At least a seven.
[23:06.320 --> 23:07.460]  And then Pink Lady?
[23:07.880 --> 23:08.640]  Pink Lady's a good Apple.
[23:08.680 --> 23:08.980]  About an eight.
[23:09.080 --> 23:09.140]  Yeah.
[23:09.360 --> 23:09.560]  Okay.
[23:09.760 --> 23:10.220]  All right.
[23:10.380 --> 23:13.120]  So Nick puts this three below a Pink Lady.
[23:13.260 --> 23:15.780]  Gavin, you put it 0.5 below the best Apple.
[23:16.100 --> 23:16.260]  Yeah.
[23:16.860 --> 23:18.580]  Eric, you don't give a fuck about apples.
[23:19.000 --> 23:19.440]  Five, it's fine.
[23:20.640 --> 23:21.700]  Andrew, what would you...
[23:21.700 --> 23:22.860]  I know you didn't get to taste it.
[23:22.960 --> 23:24.980]  But before I give my impressions, do you want to throw yours?
[23:25.160 --> 23:28.940]  Just on site, overall experience watching us eat it.
[23:29.000 --> 23:30.820]  What do you think you'd give this Apple?
[23:30.820 --> 23:39.420]  Are you asking me to hypothetically rate what this delicious looking Apple tastes like?
[23:39.840 --> 23:42.380]  Yeah, based on the data set that you have in front of you.
[23:42.460 --> 23:43.520]  I'm based on this information.
[23:44.200 --> 23:44.600]  Okay.
[23:45.120 --> 23:48.580]  So just to like further pour salt in the wound, you want me to get in this space
[23:48.580 --> 23:52.620]  that I'm actually able to taste this delicious Apple and give it a score?
[23:52.900 --> 23:53.020]  Yeah.
[23:53.140 --> 23:53.300]  Yeah.
[23:53.300 --> 23:53.960]  I would appreciate that.
[23:54.060 --> 23:56.120]  Then when you get one for real, we can compare it to the real one.
[23:56.120 --> 23:56.600]  Then we'll see if you were right.
[23:56.680 --> 23:56.820]  Yeah.
[23:57.220 --> 23:58.340]  I'm going to give this Apple...
[23:59.220 --> 24:00.520]  Glue content was pretty good.
[24:00.820 --> 24:02.440]  Sticker placement, pretty good.
[24:02.580 --> 24:04.620]  Size, packaging, solid.
[24:04.820 --> 24:06.100]  Nice shine on the red.
[24:06.200 --> 24:07.020]  Not too waxy.
[24:07.460 --> 24:09.420]  I'd give it... give it an 8 out of 10.
[24:09.800 --> 24:10.320]  8 out of 10.
[24:10.540 --> 24:10.800]  Okay.
[24:10.900 --> 24:11.500]  8 out of 10.
[24:11.800 --> 24:12.480]  All right.
[24:17.280 --> 24:22.840]  I would say I'm a little kinder than these guys.
[24:23.660 --> 24:27.160]  I think the average Apple is a 6.85.
[24:28.040 --> 24:28.980]  Just on average.
[24:28.980 --> 24:30.540]  A box standard Apple is a 6.85.
[24:30.840 --> 24:33.900]  I would give this Apple 7.6.
[24:35.080 --> 24:36.580]  I think it's better than an average Apple.
[24:36.680 --> 24:37.400]  That's pretty high.
[24:37.700 --> 24:40.780]  I'm going to give it... it's not a full point higher than your average box standard Apple,
[24:40.880 --> 24:43.120]  but I would say it's a 0.8 higher or so.
[24:43.560 --> 24:45.840]  So 0.85, whatever that shakes out to be.
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.220]  So 7.6 is what I give this Apple.
[24:49.100 --> 24:51.520]  So we got a 5, we got a 6, we got a 5.
[24:52.060 --> 24:52.880]  Andrew gave it an 8.
[24:54.060 --> 24:55.940]  He never even fucking tasted it, he gave it an 8.
[24:56.180 --> 24:57.700]  And I gave it a 7.6.
[24:57.700 --> 24:59.760]  Andrew, when did you start trying to get this Apple?
[25:00.660 --> 25:01.600]  Three weeks ago.
[25:01.900 --> 25:03.800]  Average score of 6.32.
[25:04.080 --> 25:10.200]  6.32 is where the Honeycrisp... I'm sorry, the Cosmic Crisp sits on the Apple scale.
[25:10.320 --> 25:11.760]  Should we put it on the leaderboard that we've got?
[25:11.860 --> 25:12.480]  Yeah, we'll need to.
[25:12.520 --> 25:14.580]  That's the first Apple to be entered on the leaderboard.
[25:15.060 --> 25:18.660]  We'll have to try another one and see how... throw it up there.
[25:18.700 --> 25:20.820]  We've got Baseball Speeds and Apple score.
[25:22.100 --> 25:22.640]  Pretty good.
[25:22.840 --> 25:23.340]  The Apple board.
[25:28.820 --> 25:30.440]  Well, thanks for listening to this.
[25:31.180 --> 25:32.380]  A podcast where we...
[25:33.420 --> 25:33.820]  It's not a podcast.
[25:34.220 --> 25:35.700]  This was supplemental podcast content.
[25:36.180 --> 25:36.740]  You're right.
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.100]  This was just a fuck you to me, is what it was.
[25:39.180 --> 25:41.160]  We could just label it appropriately as a fuck you.
[25:41.320 --> 25:43.180]  There was... I don't know what you wanted.
[25:43.740 --> 25:44.600]  What did you want me to do?
[25:44.920 --> 25:45.460]  How are we...
[25:45.460 --> 25:46.180]  I don't know.
[25:46.940 --> 25:47.360]  Oh, good.
[25:47.360 --> 25:47.920]  Alright, cool.
[25:48.400 --> 25:49.020]  Not this.
[25:49.340 --> 25:53.420]  They didn't want us to rate and review Apples the day after they came out.
[25:53.440 --> 25:54.260]  I don't know why we had...
[25:54.260 --> 25:57.840]  We made such a big deal about the Cosmic Crisp coming out.
[25:58.020 --> 26:00.160]  How do we not enjoy it at launch?
[26:00.200 --> 26:00.940]  Come on, man.
[26:01.580 --> 26:03.080]  You want these to sit for four days?
[26:03.200 --> 26:03.660]  I don't.
[26:03.780 --> 26:03.940]  Yeah.
[26:04.500 --> 26:05.460]  Yeah, you clearly do.
[26:05.560 --> 26:06.700]  You gave it a five.
[26:06.900 --> 26:08.480]  You're like, Apples are a five.
[26:08.780 --> 26:09.120]  They are.
[26:09.240 --> 26:09.880]  You're fine with it sitting.
[26:10.300 --> 26:12.080]  No, because they'll get brown and then it's like...
[26:13.160 --> 26:14.380]  That lasts for a year.
[26:14.580 --> 26:17.020]  If I bought you a ticket to America, would you come and eat the Apple?
[26:18.200 --> 26:19.360]  Oh, that's an enticing offer.
[26:22.240 --> 26:22.920]  Wait, where?
[26:23.220 --> 26:23.580]  Where?
[26:23.580 --> 26:24.460]  Where in America?
[26:24.820 --> 26:25.800]  How far am I traveling?
[26:25.840 --> 26:28.000]  I don't have to go to fucking Texas to get this Apple.
[26:28.140 --> 26:29.300]  Theoretically, I could go closer.
[26:30.060 --> 26:30.380]  To what?
[26:30.420 --> 26:31.720]  It's too far in the middle and down?
[26:32.720 --> 26:33.520]  It's just...
[26:33.960 --> 26:36.180]  Yeah, it's the furthest north I've ever been.
[26:36.360 --> 26:38.140]  So I don't know if I want to make that trip again.
[26:41.780 --> 26:42.180]  Bye.
[26:42.640 --> 26:49.240]  Thank you for tuning in to season two's first supplemental episode of F*** Face.
[26:49.560 --> 26:51.920]  If you're looking to figure out where this fits on the timeline,
[26:52.100 --> 26:54.280]  it's right between episode 76 and 77.
[26:54.280 --> 26:55.780]  This was not a half episode.
[26:55.960 --> 26:58.240]  But between the recordings of 77 and 78.
[26:58.720 --> 26:59.240]  That is true.
[26:59.500 --> 27:03.620]  It was recorded, but it was physically recorded between 77 and 78.
[27:03.760 --> 27:05.040]  Who knows when it'll be edited?
[27:05.120 --> 27:06.200]  After Daylight Savings.
[27:06.400 --> 27:07.460]  If... that's true.
[27:07.600 --> 27:08.820]  Sunday was Daylight Savings week.
[27:10.060 --> 27:10.960]  We fell back.
[27:11.340 --> 27:11.520]  Yeah.
[27:11.720 --> 27:13.760]  So you are one hour behind on the clock.
[27:14.580 --> 27:15.440]  Thanks for listening.
[27:15.580 --> 27:21.420]  If you enjoyed this supplemental content and would appreciate more supplemental content,
[27:21.560 --> 27:23.700]  not half episodes, but supplemental content, let us know.
[27:23.700 --> 27:26.420]  And as always, rate and review.
[27:26.880 --> 27:27.700]  Thanks for listening.
[27:28.340 --> 27:28.820]  Bye.
[27:37.550 --> 27:39.250]  What? I don't... what do you...
[27:39.250 --> 27:39.990]  It just stopped.
[27:42.250 --> 27:43.410]  Hit roll again.
[27:44.030 --> 27:45.550]  Yeah, that's right. He can't roll again.
[27:45.630 --> 27:47.330]  So this is all... this is all trash.
[27:47.770 --> 27:49.570]  I just hit roll again.
[27:49.650 --> 27:51.150]  You just told him hit stop again.
[27:51.250 --> 27:52.330]  Why are you hitting stop again?
[27:52.330 --> 27:53.670]  You just said you couldn't roll.
[27:54.510 --> 27:56.430]  You said that you couldn't roll.
[27:56.730 --> 27:58.070]  Now I'm rolling again.
[27:58.210 --> 27:59.830]  I said I just rolled again.
[27:59.830 --> 28:01.530]  And you're like, I can't roll again.
[28:01.530 --> 28:05.210]  No, you said you stopped rolling and then you said hit stop again.
[28:05.630 --> 28:07.990]  So should we point out that we stopped... are we recording?
[28:08.350 --> 28:08.450]  Yeah.
[28:08.610 --> 28:09.370]  We stopped recording.
[28:09.890 --> 28:13.870]  We had about a minute of chat and then Andrew said, there will be revenge.
[28:14.430 --> 28:15.370]  When referring to the...
[28:15.370 --> 28:20.390]  Not only that, in addition to Andrew losing his mind and getting angrier in that one minute,
[28:20.530 --> 28:21.610]  Gavin got even dumber.
[28:22.490 --> 28:26.230]  Like Gavin got extra... he was already fucking stupid in this part.
[28:26.290 --> 28:28.150]  He got even dumber.
[28:28.350 --> 28:29.490]  There's so much going on in the room.
[28:29.490 --> 28:30.430]  There's so many distractions.
[28:30.630 --> 28:32.670]  Usually I'm sat in the dark in my office at home.
[28:33.050 --> 28:34.590]  Andrew's angry and you're stupid.
[28:34.830 --> 28:36.270]  What was the second stupid thing I did?
[28:36.890 --> 28:41.170]  When he gave you the numbers and then it was right as we ended,
[28:41.370 --> 28:45.750]  what was the conversation that we had that was just like you not paying attention again?
[28:52.250 --> 28:54.650]  Is this part of Andrew's revenge?
[28:57.850 --> 28:58.730]  Jesus Christ.
[29:01.070 --> 29:01.930]  Get me out of here.
[29:02.850 --> 29:04.250]  Let's go hit these with a baseball bat.
[29:04.510 --> 29:05.690]  Yeah, I'm gonna make a sandwich.
