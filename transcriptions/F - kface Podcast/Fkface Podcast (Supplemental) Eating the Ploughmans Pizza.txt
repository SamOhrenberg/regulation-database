[00:14.900 --> 00:20.780]  Well, here we are. Office day. Is this the entrance?
[00:21.520 --> 00:25.820]  Eric said that this is the only time we'll ever use the pizza oven, and that that's it.
[00:25.960 --> 00:30.920]  But I say, and Nick agreed very quickly, this will be a semi-regular thing, and we'll keep
[00:30.920 --> 00:35.100]  coming up with recipes and improving, and it all goes into the cookbook.
[00:35.380 --> 00:40.080]  Hi, welcome to the supplementary episode of F*** Face. We've gotten together at Geoff's
[00:40.080 --> 00:42.660]  house to cook these pizzas, is how you set the scene.
[00:42.700 --> 00:45.880]  But this is like 20 minutes into the pizza video, isn't it? Is this a separate thing?
[00:46.300 --> 00:51.400]  Are we not releasing audio of this? As an audio podcast?
[00:51.740 --> 00:52.920]  Oh! This is an audio thing?
[00:53.600 --> 00:55.240]  Are you for real?
[00:55.520 --> 00:57.240]  See, this is why he produces.
[00:57.480 --> 00:57.640]  What?
[00:57.920 --> 00:59.500]  It's an audio podcast!
[01:00.920 --> 01:01.900]  He's right, he's totally right.
[01:02.280 --> 01:04.000]  There are people who just want this!
[01:04.300 --> 01:04.940]  He's totally right.
[01:05.900 --> 01:07.260]  No, you're right, that's a good point.
[01:07.280 --> 01:07.560]  You nailed it.
[01:07.560 --> 01:12.180]  Well, in that case, let me just say, we just filmed episode, what, 128 yesterday?
[01:12.380 --> 01:15.660]  And then today, Eric has been on point with the intros.
[01:15.860 --> 01:17.980]  I nominate Eric for season five intro guy.
[01:18.580 --> 01:24.240]  It's so easy to set the scene, and then you go, I don't...
[01:24.240 --> 01:29.920]  Welcome to F*** Face Supplementary Pizza Podcast number one, office day number two, not quite
[01:29.920 --> 01:37.200]  sausage talk, it's Geoff, it's Gavin, it's Andrew, Nick and Emily also here, we're recording
[01:37.200 --> 01:42.060]  live at Geoff's house, Geoff and Emily's house, I'm sorry, Emily, Geoff and Emily's house,
[01:42.120 --> 01:44.560]  which is beautiful, Emily, it's absolutely gorgeous.
[01:45.000 --> 01:46.200]  Only she gets the compliment for that.
[01:47.100 --> 01:47.560]  Yeah.
[01:47.760 --> 01:50.160]  As if I'm some design scrub.
[01:50.320 --> 01:54.840]  I will say, I don't think it would look like this if you were to decorate it.
[01:57.680 --> 02:00.680]  Andrew is in his home in Canada.
[02:00.860 --> 02:01.060]  I am.
[02:01.200 --> 02:05.580]  And is trying to make a similar pizza, and that's the scene.
[02:05.840 --> 02:06.460]  Take it away.
[02:06.460 --> 02:13.260]  Well, yeah, I don't know, it's similar, I went a completely different direction, to be
[02:13.260 --> 02:13.620]  honest.
[02:14.240 --> 02:19.420]  I did ask Eric to forward me the list of ingredients that they were going to get, but then Geoff
[02:19.420 --> 02:22.640]  just decided to make a pepperoni pizza, so I didn't feel like I needed to follow up.
[02:22.640 --> 02:23.920]  Well, I still made my pizza.
[02:24.080 --> 02:27.140]  Just so you know, pepperonis on the list.
[02:28.820 --> 02:29.540]  There you go.
[02:30.380 --> 02:30.600]  Yeah.
[02:31.740 --> 02:32.620]  So what did you make?
[02:32.720 --> 02:32.940]  Absolutely.
[02:33.200 --> 02:34.460]  Do you want to see ours first?
[02:34.460 --> 02:38.800]  I did a very basic barbecue base pizza with some cheese.
[02:38.940 --> 02:40.240]  It's a cheese barbecue pizza.
[02:40.620 --> 02:42.560]  What kind of barbecue sauce did you use as the base?
[02:43.560 --> 02:48.620]  I used a Rufus Teague barbecue sauce as the base sauce.
[02:49.000 --> 02:51.260]  Is Rufus Teague a famous Canadian barbecue master?
[02:51.960 --> 02:55.140]  I don't know anything about... what was the woman that made the baskets?
[02:55.420 --> 03:00.220]  I know less about the barbecue guy than I know about Leona Waddell, I think was her name,
[03:00.500 --> 03:01.780]  on the scale of knowing.
[03:01.780 --> 03:06.380]  Can I ask, are you saying that you just put barbecue sauce instead of tomato sauce and
[03:06.380 --> 03:07.400]  then put cheese on top of it?
[03:08.100 --> 03:08.320]  Yeah.
[03:08.660 --> 03:08.940]  Yep.
[03:09.080 --> 03:09.940]  That's exactly what I did.
[03:10.020 --> 03:10.200]  Huh.
[03:10.660 --> 03:10.920]  Alright.
[03:10.960 --> 03:12.200]  Did it usually have chicken or something on it?
[03:12.960 --> 03:13.600]  No, absolutely.
[03:13.820 --> 03:14.440]  Yeah, I didn't have chicken.
[03:15.800 --> 03:16.620]  Wasn't on the list.
[03:16.780 --> 03:17.380]  I'll tell you what, Andrew.
[03:17.460 --> 03:20.000]  I didn't have any of the stuff that I used today.
[03:20.200 --> 03:20.900]  We just got it.
[03:22.200 --> 03:22.820]  No, that's fair.
[03:23.040 --> 03:23.220]  Yeah.
[03:23.420 --> 03:24.520]  I just, you know, I...
[03:25.060 --> 03:26.700]  Listen, I'm cooking out of a skillet.
[03:26.740 --> 03:31.060]  If we want to be honest, I realized phase one, I was in trouble when last night I went
[03:31.060 --> 03:34.920]  to remove my dough from the freezer, which had been there a while.
[03:35.480 --> 03:38.080]  And I learned it expired like seven months ago.
[03:38.200 --> 03:41.440]  So I didn't have much hope for this, just generally speaking.
[03:41.800 --> 03:45.000]  He was going to make pizza any day now for about a year.
[03:45.720 --> 03:48.680]  Now, is that in your little mini fridge in your bedroom?
[03:49.420 --> 03:50.040]  No, no, no.
[03:50.100 --> 03:51.120]  That's a proper fridge.
[03:51.140 --> 03:52.260]  I don't have a freezer in my little mini fridge.
[03:52.260 --> 03:52.940]  I don't think he has a mini fridge.
[03:53.020 --> 03:54.300]  This is properly frozen.
[03:55.460 --> 03:58.500]  But yeah, the yeast was not great.
[03:58.840 --> 03:59.480]  Probably died.
[03:59.880 --> 04:01.320]  Didn't rise very much.
[04:04.410 --> 04:08.730]  Kind of flat, kind of hard in ways I can't describe.
[04:09.050 --> 04:11.230]  Like maybe that's the death of the yeast in the dough.
[04:11.410 --> 04:14.090]  I've taken a variety of photos, though, to show you my dough.
[04:14.430 --> 04:15.830]  I've made several pizzas this month.
[04:15.850 --> 04:16.630]  Should we switch to a...
[04:16.630 --> 04:17.550]  So, so what did you...
[04:17.550 --> 04:17.750]  Please.
[04:17.850 --> 04:18.710]  So what did you do then?
[04:19.550 --> 04:20.430]  What do you mean, what did I do?
[04:20.570 --> 04:22.370]  Did you use the seven month expired dough?
[04:23.450 --> 04:24.170]  Yeah, absolutely.
[04:24.390 --> 04:24.530]  I did.
[04:24.610 --> 04:24.830]  It's dough.
[04:24.890 --> 04:26.210]  It's been frozen this entire time.
[04:27.070 --> 04:27.770]  You're going to...
[04:27.770 --> 04:28.830]  You're going to die.
[04:28.990 --> 04:29.310]  Don't eat that.
[04:29.310 --> 04:30.730]  He's going to get botulism.
[04:30.730 --> 04:32.050]  No, it's just yeast.
[04:32.310 --> 04:33.510]  It's just the yeast that died.
[04:33.850 --> 04:34.610]  I'm not going to die.
[04:34.690 --> 04:35.230]  The yeast died.
[04:35.590 --> 04:36.750]  There's only some of it that's dead.
[04:36.910 --> 04:37.190]  All right.
[04:37.270 --> 04:38.070]  Well, why don't you show us?
[04:39.110 --> 04:39.390]  Okay.
[04:39.810 --> 04:41.790]  Uh, let me, let me pull up my phone.
[04:42.190 --> 04:43.730]  So this has been a journey as a whole.
[04:43.810 --> 04:47.250]  So I'm going to show you guys mine before I get to see the pizzas that, that you made.
[04:47.330 --> 04:47.570]  Yeah.
[04:47.730 --> 04:48.790]  I'm guessing based on this setup.
[04:49.070 --> 04:49.390]  Okay.
[04:49.650 --> 04:49.970]  Yeah.
[04:49.970 --> 04:51.430]  So we're going to, we're going to go on a little bit of a journey.
[04:51.470 --> 04:55.830]  So I used a skillet, the tiny waffle maker skillet version you guys had.
[04:55.870 --> 05:00.210]  So this is, this is my first, this is my first attempt.
[05:00.210 --> 05:00.430]  Okay.
[05:00.530 --> 05:01.990]  So I made a tiny little baby pizza.
[05:02.130 --> 05:05.430]  I used a McDonald's million dollar game piece for scale.
[05:05.850 --> 05:08.490]  So you can see the size of how tiny it is.
[05:08.850 --> 05:09.210]  God.
[05:10.210 --> 05:11.670]  I went with a tiny little pizza.
[05:11.850 --> 05:12.530]  He made pizza chips.
[05:14.110 --> 05:14.670]  What'd he say?
[05:14.790 --> 05:15.650]  Pizza chips.
[05:16.030 --> 05:16.950]  That sounds amazing.
[05:17.550 --> 05:17.810]  Yeah.
[05:17.910 --> 05:19.190]  It's, it's a little pizza chip.
[05:19.210 --> 05:19.810]  That's a great idea.
[05:19.890 --> 05:23.410]  I thought about getting Pringles pizza chips to maybe put those in the mix, but I didn't.
[05:23.490 --> 05:24.230]  So I let that cook.
[05:24.310 --> 05:25.910]  I wasn't confident it would cook at all.
[05:25.990 --> 05:26.190]  Yeah.
[05:26.270 --> 05:26.770]  It did.
[05:26.990 --> 05:27.770]  It rose.
[05:27.870 --> 05:28.470]  It even rose.
[05:28.470 --> 05:29.310]  There's still some yeast.
[05:29.470 --> 05:30.670]  There's still some yeast alive in that son of a bitch.
[05:30.770 --> 05:37.530]  And I prepared a second tiny little pizza, which I put on and let me say, it looked fucking
[05:37.530 --> 05:39.210]  delicious as it cooked.
[05:39.590 --> 05:40.030]  It rose.
[05:40.270 --> 05:40.470]  It cooked.
[05:40.770 --> 05:41.610]  We got a little cheese going.
[05:41.790 --> 05:43.650]  It actually looked pretty goddamn good.
[05:43.970 --> 05:46.710]  So that's my tiny, that's the tiny little pizza I had.
[05:47.390 --> 05:52.150]  And every time, every pizza I made, I got like Italian pizza hands cause I'd make a
[05:52.150 --> 05:53.330]  pizza and I'd grow confident.
[05:53.590 --> 05:56.550]  So we finished the little guy, put that to the side.
[05:56.630 --> 05:57.650]  We start working bigger.
[05:57.650 --> 05:59.910]  We're getting a little bit bigger with every little pizza.
[06:00.070 --> 06:02.350]  I ate the little one, honestly, delicious.
[06:02.670 --> 06:03.510]  It was fantastic.
[06:03.890 --> 06:05.090]  It's fantastic pizza.
[06:05.330 --> 06:09.230]  I ate the second one that you see next to it as well.
[06:09.310 --> 06:10.050]  I cooked that up.
[06:10.530 --> 06:11.430]  I took a bite.
[06:11.490 --> 06:12.050]  I was so excited.
[06:12.230 --> 06:13.890]  I ate it before I even could take a photo.
[06:15.130 --> 06:15.970]  Very doughy.
[06:15.990 --> 06:16.970]  It was very doughy.
[06:17.190 --> 06:22.370]  Didn't cook all the way through was the problem on that one, but we kept trying and we just
[06:22.370 --> 06:22.970]  kept getting bigger.
[06:23.010 --> 06:25.070]  We got to get more cheese in the mix.
[06:25.230 --> 06:25.750]  Oh wow.
[06:26.050 --> 06:26.810]  Oh wow.
[06:26.810 --> 06:30.170]  Your pizza confidence is growing.
[06:30.470 --> 06:31.090]  It is incredible.
[06:31.130 --> 06:31.430]  It is.
[06:31.510 --> 06:33.090]  Yeah, it has grown exponentially.
[06:33.390 --> 06:35.570]  Got that, got that cooking in the skillet.
[06:35.870 --> 06:39.790]  I couldn't close the lid cause it was burning the top of the cheese, which was a problem
[06:39.790 --> 06:41.390]  I should have considered beforehand.
[06:41.730 --> 06:43.710]  So we went open faced on that one.
[06:43.770 --> 06:47.810]  And this is what is currently sitting next to me, ready to be enjoyed.
[06:48.310 --> 06:49.790]  It's going to be very doughy.
[06:49.970 --> 06:51.650]  It doesn't look very much like a pizza.
[06:51.950 --> 06:53.670]  It's barbecue sauce.
[06:53.670 --> 06:56.910]  It's barbecue sauce on dough with some cheese melted on top.
[06:57.150 --> 06:59.150]  Yeah, you can't really see the pizza.
[07:00.250 --> 07:00.690]  What?
[07:00.930 --> 07:02.990]  The crust is, is that the crust of the top?
[07:03.270 --> 07:05.010]  Yeah, it's spilled over quite a lot.
[07:05.110 --> 07:07.070]  It looks like the blob from the blob.
[07:09.730 --> 07:15.210]  It looks like remnants of like the marshmallow man from Ghostbusters, like you shot a chunk
[07:15.210 --> 07:15.670]  off him.
[07:17.050 --> 07:18.230]  Yeah, it's not great.
[07:18.330 --> 07:18.930]  It's going to be bad.
[07:18.970 --> 07:21.050]  But the little ones I'm telling you were fucking delicious.
[07:21.170 --> 07:21.750]  They look pretty good.
[07:21.910 --> 07:22.170]  They look delicious.
[07:22.170 --> 07:23.070]  That little baby one?
[07:23.570 --> 07:25.030]  That little baby one is the way to go.
[07:25.050 --> 07:25.850]  Let's stay on that.
[07:26.150 --> 07:27.030]  Yeah, that looks phenomenal.
[07:27.250 --> 07:27.470]  There you go.
[07:27.550 --> 07:28.250]  I love that.
[07:28.370 --> 07:29.070]  Yeah, I'm not...
[07:29.070 --> 07:30.910]  He kind of fell to his pizza hubris.
[07:31.190 --> 07:33.030]  Like, he got pretty confident.
[07:33.390 --> 07:34.890]  It's like confidence, quality.
[07:34.990 --> 07:35.530]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:35.530 --> 07:35.810]  Definitely.
[07:36.370 --> 07:36.590]  Yeah.
[07:37.350 --> 07:37.750]  Yeah.
[07:38.030 --> 07:38.870]  It's a great scale.
[07:40.290 --> 07:42.470]  I'm excited to see what what you all did.
[07:42.550 --> 07:46.870]  I had a belief going in that mine would be undercooked and yours would be charcoal was
[07:46.870 --> 07:48.030]  how I assumed it would go.
[07:49.030 --> 07:49.430]  Okay.
[07:49.430 --> 07:53.090]  I said yesterday that it would be two ends of a different shit spectrum.
[07:55.210 --> 07:56.670]  Now, which which do you want to start?
[07:56.770 --> 07:58.870]  You want to start with Geoff's pizza or do you want to start with Gavin's pizza?
[07:59.050 --> 07:59.490]  Or Eric's.
[07:59.610 --> 08:01.070]  I mean, I made a baby one.
[08:01.190 --> 08:02.270]  Oh, Eric made a pizza too?
[08:02.350 --> 08:04.590]  Yours might be good to start with because it would take over from his side.
[08:04.590 --> 08:04.870]  Oh, that's true.
[08:05.030 --> 08:05.070]  Yeah.
[08:05.170 --> 08:06.090]  Oh, we can grow in size.
[08:06.210 --> 08:06.350]  Yeah.
[08:07.050 --> 08:08.410]  We'll present our pizzas to you, Andrew.
[08:08.470 --> 08:09.390]  I'll monitor the camera.
[08:09.750 --> 08:10.030]  Okay.
[08:11.570 --> 08:13.450]  So your pizza is slightly bigger.
[08:13.570 --> 08:14.210]  Is that what you're saying?
[08:14.350 --> 08:15.310]  This is Eric's baby.
[08:15.390 --> 08:16.570]  This is my baby pizza.
[08:17.610 --> 08:17.830]  Hang on.
[08:17.830 --> 08:18.510]  Oh, this is Eric's.
[08:18.510 --> 08:19.570]  That looks delicious.
[08:19.870 --> 08:20.430]  Thank you.
[08:20.530 --> 08:21.470]  That looks great.
[08:22.750 --> 08:28.930]  So it's a regular pepperoni pizza and I did a crescent roll stuffed crust with mozzarella
[08:28.930 --> 08:29.830]  cheese on the outside.
[08:30.250 --> 08:31.730]  So that's fantastic.
[08:31.930 --> 08:32.370]  There you go.
[08:32.510 --> 08:33.530]  I'm pretty happy about that.
[08:33.670 --> 08:33.850]  All right.
[08:33.890 --> 08:34.510]  That looks...
[08:34.510 --> 08:35.750]  I want a piece of that.
[08:35.910 --> 08:36.130]  Right.
[08:36.270 --> 08:36.730]  Not bad.
[08:36.810 --> 08:37.330]  That looks great.
[08:37.690 --> 08:38.410]  That's the first.
[08:38.970 --> 08:40.590]  Andrew, that's the first of our pizzas.
[08:41.450 --> 08:42.690]  Do we want to go to Geoff's now?
[08:42.830 --> 08:43.490]  I think we should go to Geoff's.
[08:43.510 --> 08:44.790]  Because that's that's sort of the whole deal.
[08:44.890 --> 08:45.170]  Let's see Geoff's.
[08:45.230 --> 08:47.210]  And then we can tuck in all together at the same time.
[08:47.310 --> 08:48.050]  Yeah.
[08:48.050 --> 08:50.070]  Because Geoff's is very similar, I believe.
[08:50.230 --> 08:52.870]  It's just a pepperoni pizza as well, from what I understand.
[08:53.650 --> 08:56.010]  Yeah, this is a nice, lovely pepperoni.
[08:56.010 --> 08:57.190]  I don't like the way he's got the knife out.
[08:57.390 --> 08:57.790]  That's...
[08:57.790 --> 08:59.050]  We don't have a pizza cutter.
[09:01.790 --> 09:02.490]  You know what?
[09:02.550 --> 09:03.250]  That's not...
[09:03.250 --> 09:06.610]  It's overcooked for sure, but it's not nearly as bad as I expected.
[09:06.630 --> 09:08.350]  That looks like a store-bought pizza.
[09:08.490 --> 09:09.950]  That doesn't look like a pizza...
[09:09.950 --> 09:10.390]  How's that?
[09:11.450 --> 09:12.490]  Eh, yeah.
[09:13.070 --> 09:13.850]  It looks fine.
[09:13.990 --> 09:14.530]  Wow, he's not impressed.
[09:14.550 --> 09:15.750]  Wow, he doesn't give a fuck about...
[09:15.750 --> 09:17.170]  He was so complimentary in mine.
[09:17.170 --> 09:18.210]  He didn't give a fuck about yours.
[09:18.210 --> 09:18.610]  Yeah, it was okay.
[09:19.370 --> 09:20.670]  It's a little too flat for me.
[09:20.730 --> 09:20.870]  He didn't care.
[09:21.230 --> 09:22.430]  I like a thicker crust, personally.
[09:22.790 --> 09:22.930]  Okay.
[09:23.110 --> 09:23.370]  Okay.
[09:23.750 --> 09:24.890]  And now, Gavin.
[09:25.170 --> 09:26.550]  Oh, I'll be right back, Andrew.
[09:26.610 --> 09:27.230]  Oh, you want to take your...
[09:27.230 --> 09:27.570]  Okay, cool.
[09:28.710 --> 09:30.130]  Let me set this down.
[09:31.370 --> 09:32.030]  So far, I'm excited.
[09:32.030 --> 09:32.090]  I'm excited.
[09:32.210 --> 09:32.750]  Eric is winning.
[09:33.030 --> 09:33.570]  Well, thank you.
[09:34.210 --> 09:35.050]  I'm hard to disagree.
[09:35.230 --> 09:36.590]  Oh, he's not going to be very nice.
[09:38.370 --> 09:40.050]  Gavin said Andrew's not going to be very nice.
[09:40.710 --> 09:41.570]  All right, Andrew, you ready?
[09:41.870 --> 09:42.130]  Let's see.
[09:42.250 --> 09:42.610]  Plowman's.
[09:42.670 --> 09:43.350]  Yeah, let's see yours.
[09:43.370 --> 09:44.630]  The Plowman's pizza.
[09:45.370 --> 09:45.730]  I'm...
[09:45.730 --> 09:48.050]  Okay, well, it looks like it was made by a plowman.
[09:48.410 --> 09:50.170]  It has your staple to it.
[09:50.250 --> 09:51.910]  Let me introduce you to some of the ingredients.
[09:52.650 --> 09:53.130]  Okay.
[09:53.250 --> 09:57.530]  Obviously, we've got the Branson pickle stuffed crust that Eric decided we should make.
[09:57.690 --> 10:00.890]  We've got some ham under there, all English cheddar.
[10:01.510 --> 10:03.650]  We've got some boiled eggs sliced.
[10:04.310 --> 10:05.270]  We've got some chutney.
[10:05.590 --> 10:06.690]  We've got some piccalilli.
[10:07.110 --> 10:10.630]  And under one side is a load of pickled onion.
[10:11.910 --> 10:13.650]  That looks so bad.
[10:14.170 --> 10:15.230]  That looks terrible.
[10:16.070 --> 10:20.730]  It looks like whoever cooked it realized the Branson was shit and tried to burn it out.
[10:20.830 --> 10:23.590]  Just like all of your edges are fucked.
[10:24.310 --> 10:28.330]  Well, by the way, this happened within about 16 seconds of being in there.
[10:29.370 --> 10:30.990]  I can't wait to see the video.
[10:32.650 --> 10:34.230]  Well, the presentation is done.
[10:34.570 --> 10:35.990]  Geoff left to go get another soda.
[10:37.250 --> 10:38.270]  Oh, he's grabbing plates.
[10:38.310 --> 10:39.970]  Plates, yeah, because then we can all try some of each.
[10:39.990 --> 10:41.690]  So we're going to try each of these pizzas.
[10:42.170 --> 10:43.450]  Which one do we want to try first?
[10:43.510 --> 10:44.270]  Do we want to go down the line?
[10:44.270 --> 10:45.730]  Do we want to save Branson for last?
[10:46.090 --> 10:46.110]  Yeah.
[10:46.110 --> 10:47.570]  Or do you want to tuck right into it?
[10:47.630 --> 10:47.730]  Oh, God.
[10:47.750 --> 10:48.430]  Because then we'll be full.
[10:48.490 --> 10:49.190]  We won't need to eat it.
[10:51.250 --> 10:51.850]  Thank you.
[10:52.290 --> 10:52.730]  Okay.
[10:53.130 --> 10:53.870]  I guess we'll...
[10:53.870 --> 10:54.610]  God, what a knife.
[10:54.890 --> 10:55.330]  Great knife.
[10:57.550 --> 10:57.990]  Okay.
[10:58.550 --> 11:00.990]  We're going to tuck into my tiny pep.
[11:02.050 --> 11:06.110]  So here we have Eric's tiny ratman pizza.
[11:06.850 --> 11:09.350]  We have Geoff's simple pepperoni pizza.
[11:09.510 --> 11:11.150]  And we have Gavin's plowman special.
[11:13.010 --> 11:15.450]  All three are going to go in the recipe book.
[11:16.770 --> 11:17.550]  Look at that.
[11:18.530 --> 11:19.950]  Imagine if this was a pizza cutter.
[11:20.210 --> 11:21.270]  That would be crazy.
[11:22.310 --> 11:24.210]  He's really hung up on the pizza cutter.
[11:24.470 --> 11:24.630]  Yeah.
[11:24.790 --> 11:26.750]  Well, it's part of, you know, cutting a pizza.
[11:28.070 --> 11:28.450]  Just saying.
[11:29.310 --> 11:30.690]  It works fine.
[11:31.510 --> 11:32.770]  Geoff, you want a little slice?
[11:32.870 --> 11:33.790]  Yeah, baby, of course.
[11:34.290 --> 11:36.110]  The only one I don't want is Gavin's.
[11:36.330 --> 11:37.110]  Oh, come on now.
[11:37.190 --> 11:37.910]  No, I'm going to have some.
[11:39.470 --> 11:39.830]  Gavin?
[11:40.050 --> 11:41.130]  Do we like all eat at once?
[11:41.650 --> 11:42.010]  Yeah.
[11:42.530 --> 11:43.290]  Well, I'll wait.
[11:43.390 --> 11:43.710]  We'll all wait.
[11:45.030 --> 11:45.690]  Be patient.
[11:45.990 --> 11:46.110]  I'm starving.
[11:47.550 --> 11:47.950]  We're good.
[11:48.070 --> 11:48.290]  We have a bunch of pizza to eat.
[11:48.290 --> 11:49.770]  Gavin, do you think that this...
[11:49.770 --> 11:52.530]  Do you think your pizza is going to taste better than the condiment you made?
[11:52.710 --> 11:54.370]  If we're going to compare previous creations?
[11:55.450 --> 11:57.430]  Let's not bring up condiments while we're all in person.
[11:57.830 --> 11:59.090]  All right, let's give it a try.
[12:02.310 --> 12:02.550]  Mmm.
[12:06.080 --> 12:06.640]  Pepperoni pizza.
[12:08.200 --> 12:08.920]  There's cheese.
[12:09.560 --> 12:10.280]  There's pepperoni.
[12:11.160 --> 12:11.860]  There's dough.
[12:12.020 --> 12:12.480]  There's cheese.
[12:12.480 --> 12:13.340]  I can taste the...
[12:13.340 --> 12:14.280]  How's the stuffed crust?
[12:14.420 --> 12:15.360]  The dough flavor's there.
[12:16.260 --> 12:17.040]  Stuffed crust is good.
[12:17.720 --> 12:18.340]  This is a good pizza.
[12:19.900 --> 12:21.040]  That looks like a great pizza.
[12:21.440 --> 12:25.680]  I think if we learn how to control the temperature and then learn what temperature we need to
[12:25.680 --> 12:27.440]  cook at, we can really dial that in.
[12:30.180 --> 12:31.180]  Should we try that one?
[12:32.120 --> 12:32.440]  Absolutely.
[12:33.520 --> 12:34.100]  Yeah, I'll cut it up.
[12:35.920 --> 12:37.380]  If only I had a pizza cutter, right?
[12:38.800 --> 12:42.040]  He's saying it like that, but now he has to cut the pizza, so I guess we'll wait and see.
[12:42.860 --> 12:45.860]  So, for those listening, we're moving on to Geoff's pepperoni.
[12:47.240 --> 12:49.640]  You really should be watching this, but...
[12:49.640 --> 12:51.560]  This video is on YouTube as well, so you can see.
[12:52.680 --> 12:57.020]  There's also a video of the process of the pizza being made.
[12:57.160 --> 12:58.080]  Or maybe it's just one video.
[12:58.260 --> 12:58.920]  Or maybe it's just one video.
[12:59.140 --> 13:00.660]  If Gavin said, please, only make me make one video.
[13:01.660 --> 13:03.400]  Well, I'm not making this bit, so it's fine, right?
[13:06.880 --> 13:07.740]  Who's making this bit?
[13:07.880 --> 13:08.340]  Is this?
[13:08.460 --> 13:09.000]  This is audio.
[13:09.600 --> 13:09.960]  Oh, yeah.
[13:10.620 --> 13:11.360]  Yeah, it was just video.
[13:11.360 --> 13:11.960]  It's good.
[13:13.000 --> 13:16.520]  Andrew, I'm kind of bummed that you're not here to eat the pizza with us.
[13:17.760 --> 13:22.960]  Yeah, honestly, seeing both of your pizzas made me realize that my pizza is barely pizza.
[13:23.320 --> 13:24.440]  It reduced...
[13:24.440 --> 13:27.740]  I was feeling good about my pizza until I looked at yours and Geoff's.
[13:27.780 --> 13:29.780]  I was feeling good about my pizza until I looked at mine.
[13:30.500 --> 13:32.260]  I would never feel good about what you made.
[13:32.780 --> 13:33.340]  That's on you.
[13:33.740 --> 13:35.320]  Geoff got that big slice.
[13:36.140 --> 13:36.640]  So fuck it.
[13:37.080 --> 13:37.720]  I deserve it.
[13:38.400 --> 13:38.760]  Okay.
[13:38.980 --> 13:39.560]  You cooked them.
[13:39.740 --> 13:40.460]  We tuck it into this one?
[13:40.460 --> 13:40.640]  Yeah.
[13:40.640 --> 13:42.120]  Yeah, let's tuck it in.
[13:43.380 --> 13:43.680]  Mmm.
[13:45.800 --> 13:46.400]  Oh!
[13:48.240 --> 13:49.160]  Oh, baby.
[13:56.080 --> 13:59.000]  Emily went, mmm, and then threw it down.
[13:59.920 --> 14:03.600]  That is a bog-standard pepperoni pizza.
[14:03.960 --> 14:05.000]  Thin-crust pepperoni pizza.
[14:05.340 --> 14:06.580]  That same sort of doughy feel.
[14:06.880 --> 14:07.140]  Mm-hmm.
[14:08.680 --> 14:11.880]  I'm gonna suffer some of the same issues with not knowing what temperature to cook
[14:11.880 --> 14:12.420]  a pizza at.
[14:12.840 --> 14:16.540]  I think this tastes like pizza you would get at Blazertag.
[14:18.200 --> 14:19.100]  In a good way.
[14:20.320 --> 14:20.800]  Yeah.
[14:22.280 --> 14:23.120]  Yeah, good way.
[14:23.700 --> 14:26.540]  Sometimes that's the pizza you like, a cafeteria pizza.
[14:28.060 --> 14:28.340]  Mm-hmm.
[14:28.360 --> 14:29.320]  It is like Tombstone.
[14:30.620 --> 14:31.440]  I would eat that.
[14:32.560 --> 14:33.520]  You're eating it right now.
[14:37.460 --> 14:42.780]  And finally, oh, God, this is gonna be so gushy, I think.
[14:43.460 --> 14:43.900]  Yes.
[14:45.180 --> 14:49.340]  I'm gonna save this just as a palate cleanser for later.
[14:51.140 --> 14:55.300]  Okay, who wants the onion side, and who wants the just regular Branson side?
[14:55.760 --> 14:56.040]  I'm good.
[14:56.220 --> 14:56.500]  Ooh.
[14:57.040 --> 14:59.160]  Nick is so into this.
[14:59.200 --> 14:59.480]  Mm-hmm.
[14:59.780 --> 15:00.440]  Oh, God.
[15:01.280 --> 15:01.820]  Now I'm scared.
[15:02.360 --> 15:07.620]  Nick is, like, ready to try anything and also go, ooh, it's good.
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.180]  That's so much cut... what are you... oh, my God.
[15:11.940 --> 15:12.380]  Ugh.
[15:13.880 --> 15:18.300]  The impression I get from Nick in these moments is that Nick really likes being alive.
[15:18.640 --> 15:18.960]  Oh, yeah.
[15:19.500 --> 15:19.720]  Yeah.
[15:19.960 --> 15:21.640]  Dude, really, you're just, like, into life.
[15:21.760 --> 15:22.980]  You're like, I'm just gonna do it all.
[15:23.220 --> 15:29.300]  I think Nick is a guy who really watches what he eats around the house and does a good job
[15:29.300 --> 15:29.800]  about it.
[15:29.800 --> 15:37.180]  So when it's time for face jam or f*** face to do a pizza day, he goes, all right, and
[15:37.180 --> 15:38.220]  that's it.
[15:38.380 --> 15:39.000]  Hang on.
[15:39.720 --> 15:40.860]  What happened here?
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.820]  I've got an on-camera person who definitely wants to try some.
[15:44.380 --> 15:44.680]  Definitely.
[15:45.660 --> 15:48.300]  Oh, I got a big-ass chunk of egg.
[15:48.400 --> 15:48.760]  Thank you.
[15:48.940 --> 15:51.900]  Okay, now here's my initial assessment before biting into it.
[15:52.000 --> 15:52.160]  Yeah.
[15:52.440 --> 15:53.340]  It stinks.
[15:54.980 --> 15:56.240]  There is an odor.
[15:56.240 --> 16:00.360]  When I was holding the laptop earlier, there was a distinct odor.
[16:00.540 --> 16:02.140]  It has this, yeah, a stink odor.
[16:02.260 --> 16:02.580]  You're right.
[16:02.840 --> 16:03.480]  A hundred percent.
[16:03.840 --> 16:04.120]  All right.
[16:04.800 --> 16:05.500]  Down the hatch?
[16:06.080 --> 16:06.440]  Yeah.
[16:06.760 --> 16:07.900]  I'm gonna go get a drink.
[16:09.080 --> 16:10.120]  Yeah, absolutely, man.
[16:11.780 --> 16:13.180]  I got Diet Coke and Diet Coke.
[16:13.180 --> 16:13.680]  Hey, can I have one?
[16:16.220 --> 16:17.700]  Is this, like, an onion odor?
[16:17.780 --> 16:19.420]  Like, what is the scent, would you say?
[16:19.420 --> 16:25.160]  Well, I think part of it is it's pickled and it's chutneyed and it's onion-y.
[16:25.160 --> 16:28.280]  So it's like a vomit-y sweet and sour.
[16:28.440 --> 16:29.560]  Hey, Geoff, you're out of sodas.
[16:31.540 --> 16:32.360]  I got one outside.
[16:33.300 --> 16:34.860]  All right, do we want to all bite at the same time?
[16:34.920 --> 16:35.180]  Yeah.
[16:37.040 --> 16:40.080]  I'm gonna go for the tip and I'm also gonna go and grab some crust after this.
[16:40.600 --> 16:41.800]  Oh, it's so wet.
[16:42.020 --> 16:42.640]  Okay, here we go.
[16:42.900 --> 16:43.260]  It is...
[16:43.260 --> 16:44.880]  Stop! Stop burping!
[16:44.880 --> 16:45.680]  I can't make room.
[16:54.220 --> 16:55.880]  Ooh, that is...
[17:03.960 --> 17:09.220]  You know in, like, a horror movie when, like, in a found footage, like, all the audio cuts out when the worst thing happens?
[17:09.340 --> 17:10.480]  That's what I've experienced.
[17:10.700 --> 17:13.900]  Like, I can just tell this is the worst part of this pizza eating.
[17:13.960 --> 17:14.500]  Did you go crust?
[17:14.740 --> 17:15.140]  Yeah.
[17:15.400 --> 17:16.400]  I don't like it.
[17:19.220 --> 17:20.100]  I don't like it at all.
[17:20.320 --> 17:22.400]  Why would Papa John's make that?
[17:23.680 --> 17:24.740]  I cannot recommend that.
[17:27.240 --> 17:28.000]  Some of the...
[17:28.000 --> 17:28.780]  Well, you know what, though?
[17:30.620 --> 17:30.980]  What?
[17:31.080 --> 17:32.500]  It's kind of complementary flavors.
[17:32.900 --> 17:35.040]  There's nothing that's sticking, it's all like...
[17:35.040 --> 17:35.420]  Hold on.
[17:36.000 --> 17:37.640]  As opposed to insultory flavors?
[17:38.780 --> 17:39.680]  I feel insulted.
[17:39.920 --> 17:40.040]  Yeah.
[17:42.720 --> 17:43.120]  It's...
[17:43.120 --> 17:43.920]  It's...
[17:44.580 --> 17:44.980]  It's...
[17:45.840 --> 17:46.860]  Gavin, it's, like, inedible.
[17:47.060 --> 17:48.220]  I got way more onion that time.
[17:48.220 --> 17:49.040]  The pickled onion?
[17:49.440 --> 17:50.350]  It keeps going!
[17:52.300 --> 17:53.100]  It's pizza day.
[17:54.480 --> 17:55.200]  It's pizza day.
[17:55.260 --> 17:55.720]  He's gotta go.
[17:58.660 --> 18:00.300]  Who knows when I'll have this shot again.
[18:00.580 --> 18:01.600]  Dude, the crust is good.
[18:02.940 --> 18:03.900]  That's good crust.
[18:04.620 --> 18:05.310]  I told you.
[18:06.640 --> 18:07.580]  With the bran...
[18:07.580 --> 18:09.100]  This is almost...
[18:09.100 --> 18:10.040]  This is almost edible.
[18:11.620 --> 18:12.860]  No, it's not.
[18:15.880 --> 18:18.860]  These are flavors I don't think I've ever, like, really had.
[18:18.960 --> 18:20.900]  I don't like how Branstad pickle can be...
[18:22.200 --> 18:24.160]  crunchy and soft at the same time.
[18:28.360 --> 18:29.360]  You love it.
[18:29.460 --> 18:30.500]  He's just going to town.
[18:31.800 --> 18:32.600]  Just like...
[18:32.600 --> 18:34.340]  Just like his mom used to make.
[18:37.780 --> 18:38.960]  Gavin's looking for paper towels.
[18:39.040 --> 18:39.740]  He's doing a great job.
[18:39.940 --> 18:42.220]  And if you want to bring a few of us some,
[18:42.220 --> 18:43.120]  that might be pretty cool.
[18:44.900 --> 18:45.820]  Oh, thank you.
[18:46.120 --> 18:46.640]  My man.
[18:46.900 --> 18:47.680]  The stuffed crust is good.
[18:48.820 --> 18:49.220]  So...
[18:49.500 --> 18:50.060]  Yeah, it's good.
[18:50.500 --> 18:50.900]  No.
[18:51.200 --> 18:52.420]  I gotta say, the crust is great.
[18:52.640 --> 18:54.520]  You enjoy the Branstad pickle crust?
[18:54.680 --> 18:54.940]  I do.
[18:55.200 --> 18:55.400]  Yeah.
[18:56.060 --> 18:56.720]  That works for me.
[18:58.040 --> 18:59.140]  There's a problem in the middle.
[19:00.220 --> 19:01.000]  Here's the deal.
[19:02.580 --> 19:04.640]  I feel like...
[19:04.640 --> 19:08.000]  we may have a little bit more refining work to do.
[19:08.020 --> 19:08.700]  Or maybe not.
[19:09.040 --> 19:10.160]  Maybe we just...
[19:10.160 --> 19:11.220]  We can...
[19:11.220 --> 19:12.220]  through context clues...
[19:12.780 --> 19:13.660]  from making this first one...
[19:13.660 --> 19:14.060]  It wasn't recording?
[19:14.720 --> 19:15.760]  None of that was recording.
[19:16.500 --> 19:19.640]  Hey, we just found out that none of our video was recording.
[19:20.340 --> 19:21.300]  Not any of it?
[19:21.700 --> 19:22.040]  No.
[19:22.300 --> 19:22.920]  I don't think so.
[19:24.200 --> 19:25.380]  I just got that one right now.
[19:25.600 --> 19:25.820]  It's alright.
[19:26.360 --> 19:27.260]  The audio's good.
[19:28.560 --> 19:30.320]  Oh, I stopped when you served me.
[19:30.400 --> 19:31.300]  I think it...
[19:33.580 --> 19:35.160]  Oh, I think we've got some of it.
[19:35.580 --> 19:36.960]  We've got none of us eating my pizza.
[19:37.300 --> 19:37.960]  Oh, no.
[19:38.780 --> 19:39.260]  Uh...
[19:40.380 --> 19:41.400]  Should we film that?
[19:43.600 --> 19:44.900]  It's like two clips.
[19:45.100 --> 19:45.300]  Okay.
[19:46.740 --> 19:47.220]  Uh...
[19:47.220 --> 19:48.620]  Pickups of eating my pizza.
[19:49.900 --> 19:50.680]  Emily, uh...
[19:50.680 --> 19:51.280]  Emily's...
[19:51.280 --> 19:52.920]  Emily's just like me.
[19:53.340 --> 19:54.800]  We're both professional film people.
[19:54.820 --> 19:55.580]  Hey, you wanna eat some of mine?
[19:56.620 --> 19:58.060]  We gotta try and get...
[19:58.060 --> 19:58.460]  Oh, yeah.
[19:58.500 --> 19:59.180]  We need footage of that.
[20:00.240 --> 20:01.160]  Alright, here's...
[20:01.160 --> 20:01.820]  Let's explain.
[20:02.160 --> 20:03.160]  Eric loves an intro.
[20:03.580 --> 20:04.300]  Let's explain what happened.
[20:04.620 --> 20:04.920]  Uh...
[20:04.920 --> 20:06.080]  There was a problem with the filming.
[20:06.320 --> 20:07.000]  And, uh...
[20:07.000 --> 20:10.520]  So, we lost all of us eating Gavin's disgusting pizza.
[20:10.820 --> 20:12.120]  So, now we gotta...
[20:12.120 --> 20:12.600]  Let's eat it again.
[20:12.720 --> 20:13.180]  Eat it again.
[20:13.360 --> 20:17.640]  Now, I will say, lost is a strong word when we never had it to begin with.
[20:18.680 --> 20:21.540]  Lost implies it was something we had and we got.
[20:21.840 --> 20:22.920]  Yeah, get that egg on there.
[20:23.220 --> 20:24.640]  Yeah, we don't want to miss the egg.
[20:25.420 --> 20:25.680]  Alright.
[20:25.800 --> 20:27.920]  I would say get that bite and then get the crust as well.
[20:32.340 --> 20:33.080]  Come on!
[20:33.600 --> 20:34.740]  It's not that bad.
[20:34.760 --> 20:35.520]  It is not bad!
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.300]  It's got like 18 flavors I've never had all at once!
[20:40.800 --> 20:41.800]  Here, for you.
[20:41.840 --> 20:42.440]  Oh, yes!
[20:43.520 --> 20:43.920]  Yes!
[20:44.660 --> 20:45.060]  Eric!
[20:45.300 --> 20:47.120]  Nick's a fucking freak for this shit.
[20:47.260 --> 20:48.360]  Oh, there's piccoli on that for sure.
[20:48.380 --> 20:48.640]  Oh, yeah.
[20:48.720 --> 20:50.580]  Eric, get the bite at the front with the egg.
[20:50.640 --> 20:51.160]  Oh, that's good.
[20:52.560 --> 20:53.300]  It's why...
[20:53.300 --> 20:53.600]  Listen.
[20:54.840 --> 20:56.280]  Oh, I didn't get that flavor at first.
[20:58.800 --> 21:01.380]  Honestly, every bite I've had of it is completely different.
[21:01.420 --> 21:01.940]  It's all different.
[21:03.880 --> 21:05.520]  I really might be sick.
[21:05.680 --> 21:06.800]  No, come on.
[21:06.800 --> 21:07.800]  The egg is a snowflake, Eric.
[21:08.320 --> 21:09.320]  Why'd you do this?
[21:09.400 --> 21:09.940]  On purpose.
[21:10.900 --> 21:12.480]  Oh, maybe he should get it on camera too.
[21:12.720 --> 21:13.080]  Oh!
[21:13.240 --> 21:14.420]  Emily should have some!
[21:15.260 --> 21:15.820]  I think...
[21:15.820 --> 21:17.660]  Mine will be good because it doesn't have egg in it.
[21:18.100 --> 21:18.700]  Yeah, that...
[21:18.700 --> 21:20.300]  Yeah, the egg is the problem.
[21:21.780 --> 21:23.180]  I mean, I got a little piece of egg for you if you want.
[21:23.200 --> 21:24.240]  No, no, no.
[21:24.400 --> 21:24.880]  I don't like eggs.
[21:24.880 --> 21:27.440]  It's pretty crispy from about 18 minutes of boiling.
[21:34.220 --> 21:36.520]  It's like sweet onion and pizza sauce.
[21:36.520 --> 21:37.540]  You got some...
[21:37.540 --> 21:40.040]  I have a drinking problem.
[21:41.960 --> 21:43.760]  So you like the plowman's pizza?
[21:43.880 --> 21:44.760]  Yeah, do you want to get some crust?
[21:44.940 --> 21:45.180]  I mean, yeah.
[21:45.280 --> 21:46.860]  I think I've heard the crust is the best part.
[21:48.540 --> 21:50.700]  I hope you don't get the bite that Nick did a second ago.
[21:50.760 --> 21:51.600]  It's the char.
[21:51.720 --> 21:53.020]  I don't know who's...
[21:54.000 --> 21:54.820]  And get the front.
[21:54.900 --> 21:55.220]  Get the egg.
[21:55.480 --> 21:56.260]  Go, go, go!
[21:56.820 --> 21:57.600]  Eric, get the egg!
[21:58.080 --> 21:58.400]  Egg!
[21:58.560 --> 21:58.820]  Egg!
[21:58.980 --> 21:59.260]  Egg!
[21:59.480 --> 21:59.800]  Egg!
[22:00.080 --> 22:00.400]  Egg!
[22:00.620 --> 22:00.640]  Egg!
[22:00.920 --> 22:01.000]  Egg!
[22:01.240 --> 22:01.560]  Egg!
[22:01.560 --> 22:02.220]  Full food, Eric.
[22:05.880 --> 22:06.520]  I can't.
[22:08.520 --> 22:10.480]  He literally almost threw up down the pizza.
[22:12.120 --> 22:19.880]  So if you're just watching the video, we do have audio of all of the original bite eatings.
[22:20.000 --> 22:20.880]  So go back and listen to that.
[22:21.000 --> 22:21.820]  It's the full picture.
[22:22.820 --> 22:24.400]  Eric, are you really not going to go for the egg bite?
[22:24.540 --> 22:25.540]  I really don't know whether I can.
[22:26.260 --> 22:27.040]  I think you can.
[22:27.620 --> 22:28.580]  It's like egg chutney.
[22:29.300 --> 22:29.980]  You got it, you got it.
[22:30.000 --> 22:30.300]  Come on, man.
[22:30.300 --> 22:31.260]  Just remember it's...
[22:31.260 --> 22:31.980]  Onion.
[22:32.360 --> 22:33.020]  What are you doing?
[22:34.020 --> 22:34.940]  How do you know?
[22:35.080 --> 22:36.400]  Just remember it's all food.
[22:36.800 --> 22:37.440]  You like eggs.
[22:37.600 --> 22:38.340]  It's all going there.
[22:39.020 --> 22:39.780]  You like pizza.
[22:40.600 --> 22:41.780]  You probably like chutney.
[22:41.860 --> 22:43.000]  You bought all these ingredients.
[22:43.260 --> 22:43.580]  I did.
[22:43.600 --> 22:44.200]  You did this.
[22:44.220 --> 22:45.760]  I think looking at it is making it worse.
[22:45.900 --> 22:46.720]  Don't look at it.
[22:47.020 --> 22:48.540]  Just close your eyes and go to town.
[22:51.040 --> 22:52.460]  Oh, it dripped on all the wires.
[22:53.520 --> 22:54.680]  Got a Piccadilly drop.
[22:54.840 --> 22:55.540]  That's a Nick problem.
[22:56.500 --> 22:57.340]  Eric carries this.
[22:57.400 --> 22:57.880]  This is his problem.
[22:59.580 --> 23:00.060]  Okay.
[23:00.120 --> 23:00.800]  Go on, my son.
[23:01.000 --> 23:01.700]  It's making it worse.
[23:02.720 --> 23:03.580]  Down the hatch.
[23:04.760 --> 23:05.380]  Got this.
[23:05.660 --> 23:06.400]  Big boy, brave boy.
[23:06.680 --> 23:07.220]  Big brave boy.
[23:08.360 --> 23:09.900]  Look how strong you are.
[23:10.020 --> 23:11.520]  Look at those strong fingers.
[23:11.740 --> 23:13.740]  Look how brave you are.
[23:14.220 --> 23:15.320]  Big strong brave guy.
[23:17.760 --> 23:19.380]  What would Fernando Tatis do?
[23:21.220 --> 23:21.700]  Steroids.
[23:22.060 --> 23:22.220]  Yeah.
[23:25.540 --> 23:27.080]  It just tastes like egg.
[23:28.420 --> 23:28.820]  Yum.
[23:30.380 --> 23:31.400]  Everybody likes eggs.
[23:38.020 --> 23:39.880]  It's like when I try to tell my kid something is good.
[23:40.360 --> 23:41.060]  I like it.
[23:46.740 --> 23:49.740]  That's the face the lady made when I proposed to Emily in front of her.
[23:51.980 --> 23:52.340]  Yeah.
[23:53.380 --> 23:53.740]  Yeah.
[23:54.540 --> 23:59.300]  I told them, you haven't heard it, but I told them that nobody there was into us getting married.
[23:59.300 --> 24:00.060]  No, no.
[24:00.180 --> 24:00.340]  Yeah.
[24:00.740 --> 24:05.760]  It was funny when we have this major life moment and then get back on a tour and just sit there.
[24:06.260 --> 24:07.640]  Just like no one gives a shit.
[24:07.800 --> 24:08.980]  Congratulations, by the way.
[24:09.000 --> 24:09.260]  Thank you.
[24:10.860 --> 24:11.760]  This fucking sucks.
[24:12.480 --> 24:12.840]  Wow.
[24:13.820 --> 24:17.180]  I mean, it definitely wasn't good, but I would, I mean, I ate most of my, well.
[24:17.240 --> 24:17.440]  Right.
[24:17.680 --> 24:19.300]  These are all flavors that you know.
[24:21.860 --> 24:24.960]  I've never had that kind of pickled onion or that chutney, but.
[24:25.780 --> 24:27.920]  Is it the worst pizza you've ever had, Eric?
[24:30.320 --> 24:30.760]  Yeah.
[24:31.260 --> 24:37.280]  I mean, like legitimately, like legitimately, I'm trying to think of a pizza I've had that's worse.
[24:39.100 --> 24:43.920]  And there's never been a pizza that almost made me throw up while taking a bite.
[24:44.220 --> 24:48.160]  Like you've never been, you've never eaten a piece of pizza before that turned you off of pizza.
[24:48.400 --> 24:48.840]  Yeah.
[24:48.840 --> 24:52.580]  I mean, I'm eating a different pizza to get the flavor of this pizza out of my mouth.
[24:52.820 --> 24:52.880]  Yeah.
[24:53.080 --> 24:57.060]  Watching you move that pizza closer to your mouth and then you gagging and burping all over it.
[24:57.280 --> 24:59.000]  Vile, vile, vile.
[24:59.880 --> 25:00.980]  I hate it.
[25:01.980 --> 25:04.760]  Okay, so I think rate, like scoring, scoring.
[25:06.180 --> 25:07.680]  What would we rate Eric's one?
[25:08.320 --> 25:09.700]  Yeah, what would you rate my tiny pizza?
[25:09.840 --> 25:12.140]  I give your tiny pizza an 8.75.
[25:12.640 --> 25:12.960]  Okay.
[25:13.880 --> 25:14.200]  Gavin?
[25:14.660 --> 25:16.840]  Probably six and a half, 6.5.
[25:18.740 --> 25:19.660]  That's insane.
[25:21.120 --> 25:24.360]  Andrew, I can't wait for Gavin to rate his own pizza.
[25:24.540 --> 25:28.320]  Let's be fair, it was a very simple pizza. It wasn't very adventurous, so you're losing marks there.
[25:28.720 --> 25:32.600]  I don't want adventure when I eat a pizza. I just want it to taste good.
[25:32.680 --> 25:35.400]  Oh, hey, we have a special guest who just walked in.
[25:37.020 --> 25:38.000]  Oh, she won't.
[25:38.920 --> 25:40.380]  My small wife is here.
[25:41.880 --> 25:43.900]  Eric made a small pizza for you.
[25:43.900 --> 25:47.880]  Okay, so here's the thing. This is regular small pepperoni pizza stuff crust.
[25:48.060 --> 25:50.840]  Totally fine. No, no, it's 100% regular. It's normal.
[25:51.340 --> 25:52.160]  It is regular pizza.
[25:52.440 --> 25:54.740]  Then Geoff made a pepperoni that was also normal.
[25:56.700 --> 26:02.020]  Gavin made a pizza with chutney and hard-boiled eggs.
[26:02.880 --> 26:03.480]  And ham.
[26:04.780 --> 26:05.820]  Pickled onions.
[26:06.880 --> 26:07.620]  Branston pickle.
[26:08.100 --> 26:08.920]  Pickle lily.
[26:09.280 --> 26:10.200]  Or was it for the bib?
[26:11.200 --> 26:13.080]  It's not... yeah, it's still... well...
[26:13.920 --> 26:14.900]  It was for the bib.
[26:15.900 --> 26:19.180]  Gavin rated my pizza a 6.5.
[26:19.380 --> 26:20.060]  It's tough crust.
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.740]  I'd give my pizza at least a 7.
[26:24.160 --> 26:27.760]  It's a solid pep. It's just, you know...
[26:27.760 --> 26:28.820]  8.75.
[26:29.100 --> 26:30.820]  Okay, then how about Geoff's pizza?
[26:32.400 --> 26:35.680]  Geoff's was a bit more doughy and cold, so I'd say 6.
[26:36.280 --> 26:37.320]  I'll give mine a 7.9.
[26:37.820 --> 26:41.540]  I give yours a 7. I think it's a pepperoni pizza.
[26:41.840 --> 26:43.360]  Nick, what's your score on both of those?
[26:43.360 --> 26:45.320]  7 on the little one, 8 on the big one.
[26:45.320 --> 26:47.880]  Okay, and now it's time for Gavin's pizza.
[26:48.480 --> 26:50.060]  Well, it's a 2, isn't it? Let's be fair.
[26:50.960 --> 26:51.860]  It's not good.
[26:53.120 --> 26:55.360]  It's not good, but the flavors, I think...
[26:56.300 --> 26:57.540]  Every bite was different.
[26:59.040 --> 27:00.380]  It's the English cheddar.
[27:01.160 --> 27:02.120]  The English...
[27:02.120 --> 27:05.020]  The cheese is so strong.
[27:05.140 --> 27:05.780]  It's very strong.
[27:06.280 --> 27:11.260]  But then everything stands up to the strong cheese, so it's just a fight.
[27:11.260 --> 27:15.600]  The cheese basically stands up in the middle of the field, fronting on whoever...
[27:15.600 --> 27:18.440]  And then the branch of pickles is like, I'll match you, you son.
[27:18.620 --> 27:22.100]  And then everyone else just squares up to it, and all the flavors match.
[27:22.280 --> 27:24.340]  Except for the pickled onion. I couldn't get on board with that.
[27:26.360 --> 27:30.020]  It's absolutely... I mean, 2, I think is... I mean, I'd give it... I mean, I guess I'll give it a 1.
[27:30.400 --> 27:33.360]  If it was cooked better and not burned, I could have eaten the whole thing.
[27:33.860 --> 27:37.440]  It's a 10 on originality. It's a 10 on creativity.
[27:37.920 --> 27:41.220]  It's a negative 200 on every other thing.
[27:41.220 --> 27:42.800]  So your rating is...
[27:43.880 --> 27:44.680]  2.7.
[27:45.400 --> 27:46.260]  Higher than mine?
[27:46.480 --> 27:47.500]  Yeah, maybe 2.7.
[27:47.520 --> 27:47.700]  Nick?
[27:48.500 --> 27:49.460]  I'd give it a 3.
[27:49.880 --> 27:52.260]  Thanks, Nick. Thanks, I appreciate that.
[27:53.380 --> 27:54.340]  Emily, what do you think?
[27:54.640 --> 27:55.360]  It's an abomination.
[27:55.960 --> 27:56.880]  Well, that's not a number.
[27:57.860 --> 28:00.280]  I think a 2.
[28:00.820 --> 28:02.240]  Okay, 2. Appreciate it.
[28:02.260 --> 28:03.200]  I don't think it's a pizza.
[28:03.900 --> 28:04.740]  What do you mean?
[28:04.820 --> 28:05.640]  I mean, it looks like a pizza.
[28:05.940 --> 28:08.360]  I feel like it's a chutney on bread.
[28:09.560 --> 28:11.140]  Like, that's just an appetizer.
[28:11.140 --> 28:14.000]  Barbara, just based on the look...
[28:14.720 --> 28:16.140]  Do you hate yourself?
[28:16.780 --> 28:18.080]  Um, yeah.
[28:18.420 --> 28:21.680]  But not as much as how that turned out.
[28:24.990 --> 28:25.450]  2.
[28:25.790 --> 28:27.710]  2 based on the visuals. And what was your rank?
[28:27.950 --> 28:28.330]  A 1.
[28:28.590 --> 28:28.850]  1.
[28:29.030 --> 28:30.750]  We should call it the Plowman's 2.
[28:32.090 --> 28:34.070]  I will change my score to 2 for that.
[28:34.450 --> 28:34.910]  Absolutely.
[28:35.630 --> 28:37.910]  That's what's gonna be the recipe, the Plowman's number 2.
[28:38.090 --> 28:39.030]  Oh, man.
[28:39.250 --> 28:39.570]  Love it.
[28:39.570 --> 28:44.390]  Yeah, I think I would probably do it again without the pickled onion and without the pick-a-lily.
[28:44.550 --> 28:45.990]  Okay, so hang on.
[28:46.010 --> 28:47.070]  Shut the fuck up.
[28:47.110 --> 28:47.310]  Okay.
[28:47.410 --> 28:48.590]  What are you talking about?
[28:48.890 --> 28:51.290]  The Branson pickle was the whole point.
[28:51.730 --> 28:53.870]  No, pickled onion is different than Branson pickle.
[28:54.030 --> 28:56.390]  No, no, I'm talking about the pickled onion in the jar.
[28:56.850 --> 28:58.070]  The yellow stuff.
[28:58.910 --> 29:00.630]  He had two different kinds of pickled onion.
[29:00.850 --> 29:01.910]  He liked one.
[29:02.030 --> 29:03.050]  You didn't have any of that.
[29:03.150 --> 29:04.790]  Because I only did that on half the pizza.
[29:05.510 --> 29:07.770]  You had the best version of that pizza.
[29:08.430 --> 29:13.170]  The one bite with the egg just tasted like egg, but it was so wet and firm.
[29:13.310 --> 29:14.950]  The cheese was so strong.
[29:15.350 --> 29:16.490]  Ah, but the crust was phenomenal.
[29:16.630 --> 29:19.010]  You had the side of the pizza that he's on board with.
[29:19.350 --> 29:27.410]  Yeah, if I made it again, no pick-a-lily, none of that yellow floppy pickle, and the rest was phenomenal.
[29:28.590 --> 29:29.030]  Phenomenal?
[29:29.370 --> 29:29.630]  Phenomenal!
[29:29.990 --> 29:32.530]  But it just needed to be cooked. It needed to be not raw and hot.
[29:33.370 --> 29:35.630]  It was hot floppy bread with burnt bits.
[29:35.790 --> 29:36.950]  It like gave me a headache.
[29:36.950 --> 29:38.810]  I don't feel good.
[29:38.930 --> 29:39.750]  That's all the carcinogens.
[29:39.890 --> 29:41.930]  I feel bad.
[29:42.170 --> 29:42.330]  Okay.
[29:42.690 --> 29:45.810]  We didn't even talk about when that chunk of wood fell on Gavin's pizza.
[29:46.050 --> 29:48.250]  We had to separate it from the pizza.
[29:48.470 --> 29:49.490]  You dropped wood on my pizza?
[29:51.510 --> 29:52.810]  Big-ass hunk of charcoal.
[30:01.050 --> 30:02.470]  Okay, so it wasn't a win.
[30:02.470 --> 30:02.710]  What?
[30:06.900 --> 30:08.520]  But I've learned a lot.
[30:09.000 --> 30:09.660]  Oh yeah?
[30:09.880 --> 30:10.140]  Yeah.
[30:10.320 --> 30:12.180]  That's the thing. You gotta start somewhere.
[30:13.020 --> 30:15.260]  Andrew, how would you rate all these from looks? Did you do that already?
[30:15.880 --> 30:20.040]  Yeah, from looks, I would say that Gavin, yours was a one.
[30:20.700 --> 30:25.360]  Actually, I don't know if I could imagine a pizza that looked worse, to be honest.
[30:25.360 --> 30:26.560]  It's tough to scale.
[30:26.600 --> 30:27.880]  At least it was a circle.
[30:28.600 --> 30:30.140]  But I can't imagine a worse looking one.
[30:30.140 --> 30:31.120]  Here's the thing, Gavin.
[30:31.320 --> 30:37.860]  Your pizza looked like if a children's TV show was trying to show a disgusting pizza,
[30:38.080 --> 30:41.860]  it would have cut up hard-boiled eggs and chutney.
[30:42.040 --> 30:46.700]  Like it would have those things, and it would be somebody pulling like the lid off the pizza,
[30:46.920 --> 30:47.700]  and the camera would go,
[30:50.100 --> 30:53.260]  If Nickelodeon made Fear Factor, that would be a challenge.
[30:53.500 --> 30:58.840]  It looks like your pizza is something Mark Summers made kids put together.
[31:00.340 --> 31:02.000]  To avoid being slimed.
[31:02.420 --> 31:04.780]  Oh, this is wild. This is awful.
[31:05.140 --> 31:08.460]  Hey, how would you rate Geoff's pizza, just based on looks?
[31:09.160 --> 31:12.880]  Yeah, I'd say yours and Geoff's have to be a seven, just as a minimum.
[31:13.100 --> 31:16.380]  It seemed like it was cooked, it's pepperoni, there's nothing too fancy about it,
[31:16.440 --> 31:17.820]  it seems like kind of a basic dough.
[31:18.000 --> 31:19.700]  It's fine, it's solid. It's a solid pizza.
[31:19.780 --> 31:22.880]  I will say, I think we made those just to have something to eat.
[31:26.280 --> 31:27.280]  That's how it feels.
[31:27.280 --> 31:30.600]  Yeah, the real star of the show is Kevin's plowman's number two.
[31:31.680 --> 31:35.440]  What a star it was. Have you ever seen a star fall that fast?
[31:41.540 --> 31:42.220]  Proud of you.
[31:43.280 --> 31:46.400]  I'm proud of all of us. We all made a pizza today.
[31:46.500 --> 31:50.160]  That's awesome. Geoff's one and only time using that pizza oven.
[31:50.520 --> 31:50.940]  So far.
[31:52.100 --> 31:53.780]  Are you open to using it more?
[31:53.780 --> 31:56.140]  Well, we were talking about it today, Andrew.
[31:56.540 --> 31:58.940]  It's barely been four years that I've lived here.
[31:59.500 --> 32:02.300]  And we finally broke the seal, so any day now.
[32:02.400 --> 32:05.040]  It's barely been four years.
[32:05.320 --> 32:09.880]  Getting around to use that big thing in my backyard that takes up so much space.
[32:10.120 --> 32:12.400]  Is anyone having like a bubbly feeling in their tummy?
[32:13.040 --> 32:15.100]  No, because I only ate like two bites of that.
[32:16.100 --> 32:16.940]  Bubbly feeling.
[32:17.100 --> 32:21.840]  Yeah, just like a little bit of an unsettled, sort of raw egg.
[32:21.840 --> 32:25.720]  Well, I guess we should wrap up our pizza day.
[32:26.980 --> 32:28.480]  I keep smelling it.
[32:28.580 --> 32:31.280]  Yeah, it's not a good smell. It's not a good smell.
[32:31.320 --> 32:32.360]  It just stinks.
[32:32.640 --> 32:33.480]  It doesn't...
[32:33.480 --> 32:34.300]  It stinks.
[32:34.680 --> 32:35.980]  Can we identify the...
[32:36.560 --> 32:39.860]  If you huff all the ingredients, can you tell us what the pizza stinks of?
[32:40.620 --> 32:43.460]  Onion. It's a sweet onion smell, mostly.
[32:43.860 --> 32:44.340]  But then...
[32:44.340 --> 32:45.340]  It's the Vidalia onion.
[32:45.360 --> 32:47.020]  That's the thing I'm taking out, so that's fine.
[32:47.180 --> 32:48.640]  But then, egg.
[32:48.640 --> 32:51.540]  But then, just simply egg.
[32:52.400 --> 32:56.300]  Like, it's so sweet, and then it smells like an egg.
[32:57.080 --> 32:58.800]  Think about this, Gavin.
[32:59.140 --> 33:04.680]  I used seven-month expired dough and cooked it in a waffle iron, and I would have scored higher than you.
[33:04.680 --> 33:09.600]  Oh, absolutely. Andrew, just based on looks for yours, 100% you would score higher.
[33:09.780 --> 33:12.000]  Your tiny little cute handheld pizza...
[33:12.000 --> 33:12.900]  Your bagel bite is adorable.
[33:13.060 --> 33:14.720]  Those are adorable. Good work.
[33:15.600 --> 33:18.900]  I want to sell stuffy versions of it to kids.
[33:19.240 --> 33:22.600]  You can sleep with your little bagel bite pizza puff.
[33:23.080 --> 33:28.020]  Okay, we should wrap up our pizza day so that Gavin can go, I mean, have a bubbly tummy.
[33:28.220 --> 33:29.220]  I'm going to go and have an afternoon.
[33:33.420 --> 33:34.260]  Really something.
[33:35.820 --> 33:38.000]  If you want to watch this, you can.
[33:38.280 --> 33:41.600]  I mean, we'll have the uninterrupted video, except for somebody interrupted it.
[33:42.120 --> 33:48.780]  But it'll just go to, like, you know, the logo, and then it'll come on back to when we're going and resetting.
[33:48.980 --> 33:51.140]  And there's also a video of us making them.
[33:51.220 --> 33:55.600]  There is. There's a video of us making them. It might be at the beginning of this thing, but not the audio. I don't know. We'll see.
[33:56.280 --> 33:58.660]  Maybe we'll Pulp Fiction it, and who knows where it'll appear.
[33:58.680 --> 34:00.780]  Yeah, it'll be right there in the middle.
[34:03.100 --> 34:04.520]  A successful office day?
[34:05.060 --> 34:05.720]  Oh, it's a great office day.
[34:06.860 --> 34:07.660]  We're getting a lot done.
[34:07.900 --> 34:08.380]  Two for two.
[34:08.500 --> 34:09.280]  We're getting a lot done.
[34:09.280 --> 34:13.800]  We watched the monkey movie, and now it feels like we're uncorked, like we're ready to go.
[34:14.120 --> 34:14.780]  Every day.
[34:16.020 --> 34:17.220]  Thanks for joining us, Andrew.
[34:18.460 --> 34:19.100]  Thank you.
[34:19.780 --> 34:24.440]  For making such incredible pizzas, Eric and Geoff, and for whatever you made, Gavin.
[34:24.840 --> 34:25.680]  I appreciate it.
[34:25.680 --> 34:26.360]  I appreciate looking at it.
[34:26.480 --> 34:27.720]  Man, Gavin, catching a lot of heat.
[34:28.100 --> 34:29.980]  The English cheddar was just so much.
[34:32.580 --> 34:34.800]  Gavin's caught all the heat at the very beginning.
[34:34.820 --> 34:37.220]  Gavin's pizza caught on fire in one second.
[34:38.120 --> 34:40.200]  Gavin kept going, I've been sabotaged.
[34:40.740 --> 34:41.700]  I was sabotaged!
[34:41.920 --> 34:46.720]  And then the only part of the pizza that was any good, the only part of your pizza that was any good was the crust.
[34:46.760 --> 34:48.960]  I had to bite through the ash to get to the good bit.
[34:50.680 --> 34:53.040]  I thought I knocked most of that off.
[34:53.900 --> 34:55.380]  With the wood that you dropped on it?
[34:57.400 --> 34:58.420]  Well, that'll do it.
[34:59.140 --> 35:00.500]  Follow us at FaZe Jam.
[35:00.580 --> 35:00.960]  Fuck.
[35:02.180 --> 35:02.580]  Sorry.
[35:03.800 --> 35:06.120]  It's a natural habit with this amount of gross food.
[35:06.120 --> 35:10.980]  Honestly, this is how I feel after most FaZe Jam episodes, where you're just like, this is shit.
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.420]  You've got two default intros, one has a gut full of nasty food, and you just went to that one.
[35:14.740 --> 35:18.840]  Follow us at F***FacePod on Twitter and on Instagram.
[35:19.240 --> 35:22.080]  You can see all the pictures there if you listen to this like a freak.

[35:25.620 --> 35:27.800]  If you do both, that really helps us out.
[35:29.400 --> 35:30.980]  Can't promise it's gonna help you out.
[35:32.800 --> 35:36.580]  So, thank you very much. Any parting words for your pizzas?
[35:36.940 --> 35:44.780]  I just wanna say, my last parting word would just be, what a phenomenal job you have taken over doing in Season 5 as the intro-outro guy.
[35:44.960 --> 35:46.280]  And I just really appreciate it.
[35:47.680 --> 35:52.880]  After Andrew's confession that he understands intros now, I'm glad there's an appeal here.
[35:52.920 --> 35:53.240]  That's true.
[35:53.360 --> 35:58.040]  We're trying to reset. We're trying to make it make sense to people who come in on this number episode.
[35:58.040 --> 36:00.780]  So we don't have to go, yeah, go back to 16.
[36:02.960 --> 36:03.760]  Episode 128.
[36:04.280 --> 36:08.360]  Find episode 46 and count backwards until you find the one you're looking for.
[36:11.220 --> 36:12.560]  Any last words, Gavin?
[36:13.400 --> 36:14.080]  I don't think so.
[36:15.220 --> 36:18.480]  Andrew, anything strong to take us out on?
[36:19.220 --> 36:24.380]  No, I'm sad I didn't get to try some 7 pizzas, but I'm glad I'm not there.
[36:24.540 --> 36:26.040]  To avoid whatever the f*** Gavin made.
[36:26.940 --> 36:28.360]  The plowman's number 2.
[36:28.540 --> 36:30.040]  Yeah, this is to all the plowmen out there.
[36:30.140 --> 36:33.060]  Hey, if you do make your own plowman's number 2, um...
[36:33.760 --> 36:34.400]  Please don't.
[36:34.500 --> 36:35.140]  Yeah, really.
[36:35.140 --> 36:35.780]  Send us a pic.
[36:35.880 --> 36:37.940]  Yeah, send us a picture, but also rethink what you're doing.
[36:38.320 --> 36:39.220]  And don't plow in the rain.
[36:40.380 --> 36:42.220]  Don't, yeah, we found a bridge people don't like wet.
[36:43.300 --> 36:44.820]  Yeah, I don't know why they live there, but alright.
[36:45.400 --> 36:46.960]  Okay, goodbye, thank you, bye!
