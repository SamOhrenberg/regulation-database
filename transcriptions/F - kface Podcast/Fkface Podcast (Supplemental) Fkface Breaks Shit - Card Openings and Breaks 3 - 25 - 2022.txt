[00:12.540 --> 00:13.660]  Oh, shit.
[00:19.260 --> 00:21.120]  It worked! It worked!
[00:24.300 --> 00:28.480]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of Fuck, Face, Break, Shit.
[00:28.960 --> 00:33.960]  Where we fuck with Gavin relentlessly. That was very funny.
[00:34.060 --> 00:38.100]  He used a box cutter to make a slight modification to my Gatorade.
[00:38.600 --> 00:39.780]  And it has the side effect of doing...
[00:39.780 --> 00:40.540]  Stop! Stop!
[00:40.920 --> 00:42.240]  Ow! My hands!
[00:42.240 --> 00:43.780]  It's all over the... We just got...
[00:43.780 --> 00:43.800]  Ew!
[00:44.680 --> 00:45.420]  Can you stop?
[00:45.580 --> 00:46.200]  Can I get a towel?
[00:47.040 --> 00:48.620]  I can't touch the cards like this.
[00:48.700 --> 00:49.340]  Yeah, sure you can.
[00:49.920 --> 00:50.940]  There's no sugar, right?
[00:56.520 --> 00:58.220]  Well, anyway, here it is. Another...
[00:58.220 --> 00:59.080]  Oh, I forgot my captain's hat.
[00:59.280 --> 01:00.980]  Another episode of Fuck, Face, Break, Shit.
[01:01.480 --> 01:04.060]  If you're not familiar, Fuck, Face is a podcast.
[01:04.560 --> 01:05.580]  It used to be a...
[01:05.580 --> 01:08.500]  Well, it used to be an apple and a fruit podcast,
[01:08.660 --> 01:10.800]  but now it's currently a podcast about cups and cup theory.
[01:11.760 --> 01:12.080]  However...
[01:12.080 --> 01:13.040]  Those episodes haven't come out yet.
[01:13.220 --> 01:13.800]  Yeah, that's...
[01:14.340 --> 01:14.700]  Tease it.
[01:15.820 --> 01:16.540]  One of them has.
[01:16.680 --> 01:17.800]  Yeah, we've talked about cups before.
[01:17.800 --> 01:18.860]  First discussion about the cup has.
[01:18.980 --> 01:19.140]  Yeah.
[01:19.700 --> 01:20.020]  Okay.
[01:20.440 --> 01:22.760]  Anyway, we're all in on cups in 2022.
[01:23.000 --> 01:23.760]  It's the new hotness.
[01:24.900 --> 01:27.240]  But, you know, we were just having a discussion before.
[01:27.340 --> 01:29.920]  Emily was saying that she wanted to see Andrew draw a banana.
[01:30.340 --> 01:31.620]  Brian, can you pull up the banana?
[01:31.900 --> 01:32.500]  Can we see the banana?
[01:33.480 --> 01:35.240]  Just wanted to see what would happen if Andrew drew a banana from memory.
[01:35.260 --> 01:36.200]  Andrew doesn't get that much treatment.
[01:37.660 --> 01:37.880]  Yeah.
[01:37.980 --> 01:38.940]  And I need to say...
[01:38.940 --> 01:39.440]  That's good.
[01:39.440 --> 01:40.580]  It's very much a Nike swoosh.
[01:41.940 --> 01:42.260]  100%.
[01:42.260 --> 01:43.440]  It's more of a Nike swoosh vibe.
[01:43.600 --> 01:43.760]  Yeah.
[01:43.960 --> 01:44.740]  What's the bottom one?
[01:44.860 --> 01:45.500]  Why is it flat?
[01:46.220 --> 01:46.700]  I'm sorry.
[01:46.880 --> 01:47.140]  Hang on.
[01:47.220 --> 01:47.320]  Hang on.
[01:47.360 --> 01:47.700]  Hang on.
[01:47.740 --> 01:47.940]  Hang on.
[01:48.000 --> 01:48.080]  Hang on.
[01:48.460 --> 01:49.160]  What are you...
[01:49.160 --> 01:49.920]  It's a prototype?
[01:51.480 --> 01:54.060]  Well, I haven't figured out how to draw it exactly.
[01:54.220 --> 01:55.760]  Like, I'm still figuring that out a little bit.
[01:55.800 --> 01:56.600]  There's a curve to it.
[01:56.640 --> 01:57.440]  It looks like a swoosh.
[01:58.180 --> 01:59.060]  I went through it.
[01:59.380 --> 02:01.020]  I want to put that banana on a hat.
[02:01.260 --> 02:02.720]  I want to have a banana hat.
[02:04.380 --> 02:05.640]  Also wasn't ideal conditions.
[02:05.700 --> 02:07.540]  I drew that on the bottom of a box of chicken.
[02:07.540 --> 02:10.520]  I'm not doing what I have.
[02:10.980 --> 02:12.020]  With a crayon?
[02:12.220 --> 02:13.560]  Take a box of leaves.
[02:13.740 --> 02:13.980]  Wait.
[02:14.120 --> 02:14.280]  Wait.
[02:14.380 --> 02:14.500]  Yeah.
[02:14.980 --> 02:15.440]  You're right.
[02:15.820 --> 02:17.460]  Did you have a yellow crayon?
[02:18.800 --> 02:22.140]  I have a thing of, like, felt pens in my desk.
[02:22.520 --> 02:23.480]  So it's like a felt...
[02:23.480 --> 02:26.280]  It's a six-pit artist pen brush.
[02:27.580 --> 02:28.100]  Basic.
[02:28.380 --> 02:29.460]  I don't know why I have this, but I do.
[02:30.780 --> 02:31.500]  All right.
[02:31.960 --> 02:34.540]  Emily said that Andrew draws like a perfect child.
[02:34.760 --> 02:35.000]  Yeah.
[02:35.660 --> 02:36.780]  Andrew drew something...
[02:36.780 --> 02:39.740]  That is a spoiler for an upcoming episode of Fuckface.
[02:39.840 --> 02:41.020]  Hopefully we can put it on a t-shirt.
[02:41.160 --> 02:42.160]  Hopefully we can make it.
[02:42.280 --> 02:44.780]  I don't know if there's enough money in the world for the R&D...
[02:44.780 --> 02:45.720]  We absolutely can't make it.
[02:45.800 --> 02:46.420]  ...for that product.
[02:47.360 --> 02:50.380]  Anyway, also, this is...
[02:50.380 --> 02:52.360]  We're going to open up some fucking cards or something, right?
[02:52.620 --> 02:55.280]  I was going to talk about how we have...
[02:55.280 --> 02:58.120]  A lot of sagas got completed recently, but I don't want to spoil anything.
[02:58.560 --> 02:58.880]  Right.
[02:59.120 --> 03:01.460]  And this is side content, so we don't talk about the main show.
[03:01.660 --> 03:01.820]  Correct.
[03:02.300 --> 03:03.220]  So I'm not going to do that.
[03:03.520 --> 03:05.420]  But, boy, do we have a lot of fun stuff on the main show.
[03:05.420 --> 03:07.620]  I'm going to take the time to say I'm not going to do that.
[03:07.680 --> 03:08.340]  A little tease?
[03:09.200 --> 03:09.660]  A little tease?
[03:10.000 --> 03:10.560]  A little tease.
[03:12.760 --> 03:13.400]  All right.
[03:14.700 --> 03:15.280]  That's for you.
[03:15.480 --> 03:15.900]  Oh, boy.
[03:16.240 --> 03:16.940]  Thanks for coming by.
[03:17.220 --> 03:18.300]  That's right, Emily's on the soundboard.
[03:18.800 --> 03:22.360]  As always, we're going to open up a bunch of cards, and we're going to look for cool cards.
[03:22.520 --> 03:24.180]  We're going to look for dudes with mustaches.
[03:24.320 --> 03:26.800]  We're going to look for dudes that look like alcoholic stepdads.
[03:26.920 --> 03:28.120]  We're going to look for high kicks.
[03:28.300 --> 03:29.500]  We're going to look for bubble butts.
[03:29.660 --> 03:31.880]  We're going to look for dudes that look like Caleb Denicor.
[03:33.200 --> 03:35.880]  Somebody made a... Andrew showed it to me.
[03:35.940 --> 03:41.420]  Somebody made a Google Doc spreadsheet of all the things that we've declared on the show.
[03:41.500 --> 03:42.560]  And so I was looking through it last night.
[03:42.760 --> 03:44.120]  There's a lot of funny, awesome stuff in there.
[03:44.660 --> 03:47.880]  I'm glad that whoever that person is, you're an official...
[03:49.580 --> 03:50.180]  Almost there?
[03:51.060 --> 03:52.420]  Triple A fuckface fan.
[03:52.460 --> 03:52.960]  There you go.
[03:53.040 --> 03:53.960]  Triple A. Triple A fan.
[03:54.380 --> 03:55.380]  Is that above comment leave?
[03:55.400 --> 03:55.780]  That's good.
[03:55.880 --> 03:56.540]  It's like graduating.
[03:57.760 --> 03:59.860]  It's the league below Major League.
[04:00.400 --> 04:02.200]  Jack was a Major League fan.
[04:02.580 --> 04:03.080]  Not anymore.
[04:03.500 --> 04:04.680]  Jack's just a bog standard fan.
[04:04.960 --> 04:06.800]  But this person is a Triple A fan.
[04:06.920 --> 04:09.240]  Do you have the impression that Jack has stopped listening to the show?
[04:10.280 --> 04:11.320]  I don't know that he ever did.
[04:12.740 --> 04:16.580]  I opened the doc that shows what we pulled and what it says.
[04:16.780 --> 04:19.720]  The second one is Cecil Fielder.
[04:20.040 --> 04:21.400]  Category, big ass.
[04:22.800 --> 04:24.080]  What are some of the categories?
[04:24.820 --> 04:26.120]  Sucked in his chin.
[04:26.640 --> 04:27.160]  Stepdad.
[04:27.580 --> 04:28.300]  Fred Bowling.
[04:28.660 --> 04:29.440]  Best guns.
[04:30.420 --> 04:31.700]  Good card.
[04:33.240 --> 04:34.140]  Law firm.
[04:35.100 --> 04:35.140]  Twice.
[04:35.800 --> 04:36.500]  Yeah, that was...
[04:36.500 --> 04:37.200]  What were the...
[04:37.200 --> 04:38.940]  Gagney and Gagner, right?
[04:39.140 --> 04:41.440]  Yeah, because it's always going to be a two pairing.
[04:41.620 --> 04:41.780]  Yep.
[04:42.480 --> 04:43.340]  Cartoon bully.
[04:44.020 --> 04:44.660]  Bond villain.
[04:45.160 --> 04:45.900]  Highest leg.
[04:46.580 --> 04:46.960]  Sad.
[04:47.440 --> 04:48.780]  Dench, dench, dench, dench, dench.
[04:51.120 --> 04:52.160]  Funny name.
[04:52.660 --> 04:53.600]  Stuff in mouth.
[04:54.020 --> 04:54.980]  What was funny name?
[04:56.060 --> 04:56.940]  Funny name...
[04:56.940 --> 04:57.660]  Dickie Thawne.
[04:57.660 --> 04:59.360]  All right.
[04:59.560 --> 05:04.400]  To start it off, as always, we're going to go out of the gate by reaching into the pack sack.
[05:05.580 --> 05:07.300]  Jonathan Isaac faces the teacher.
[05:07.300 --> 05:07.500]  Oh, awesome.
[05:07.800 --> 05:09.200]  Getting sucked off.
[05:09.440 --> 05:12.240]  We're going to start from the pack sack.
[05:12.260 --> 05:12.660]  Yep, what do we got?
[05:12.800 --> 05:13.780]  87 tops.
[05:14.000 --> 05:14.140]  Yep.
[05:14.560 --> 05:15.560]  That was the...
[05:15.560 --> 05:17.920]  If you grew up in the 80s, this was the...
[05:17.920 --> 05:19.560]  This was the year.
[05:19.800 --> 05:21.640]  This was when cards went insane.
[05:22.200 --> 05:23.500]  This is when stuff got...
[05:23.500 --> 05:26.440]  This is when stuff started to get overprinted to the fucking moon.
[05:27.000 --> 05:30.000]  And I don't believe there's going to be any Don Zimmers in this, but that's okay.
[05:30.380 --> 05:31.600]  Because we have Rick Anderson.
[05:31.840 --> 05:32.440]  Let's see it.
[05:33.280 --> 05:33.680]  Whoa!
[05:33.760 --> 05:34.680]  It's upside down.
[05:36.640 --> 05:38.220]  Okay, I'll have to do these upside down.
[05:38.560 --> 05:40.720]  We have the Braves.
[05:41.900 --> 05:43.400]  Sharing a friendship hug.
[05:43.700 --> 05:48.080]  Now, that is how I envision my friendship with Gavin when I think about him.
[05:48.180 --> 05:49.640]  I think about us hugging and being close.
[05:49.760 --> 05:50.140]  Sharing a glove.
[05:50.240 --> 05:51.260]  And then sharing a glove.
[05:51.440 --> 05:55.140]  And then in person, he always looks like he wants to be anywhere else but.
[05:55.140 --> 05:55.600]  Huh.
[05:55.760 --> 05:57.480]  It's kind of personally sad.
[05:57.860 --> 05:58.380]  Kurt Gibson.
[05:59.940 --> 06:00.420]  Nice.
[06:00.760 --> 06:01.620]  Fuck Kurt Gibson.
[06:01.820 --> 06:02.300]  Nice, yeah.
[06:02.420 --> 06:03.620]  Fuck Kurt Gibson.
[06:03.900 --> 06:06.020]  Fuck Kurt Gibson and that fucking home run.
[06:06.220 --> 06:07.040]  Fuck him.
[06:07.160 --> 06:07.700]  Oh boy.
[06:08.120 --> 06:08.640]  Nice guy though.
[06:08.780 --> 06:09.680]  I like his...
[06:09.680 --> 06:11.260]  I can barely walk.
[06:11.520 --> 06:12.300]  Hit one home run.
[06:12.560 --> 06:13.300]  Home runs aren't so hard.
[06:13.440 --> 06:13.560]  What?
[06:13.680 --> 06:14.740]  Don Mattingly.
[06:15.260 --> 06:15.740]  That's...
[06:15.740 --> 06:17.060]  That's a great Mattingly right there.
[06:17.060 --> 06:17.840]  That is a...
[06:17.840 --> 06:19.360]  That's a classic baseball look.
[06:19.580 --> 06:21.080]  That is Don Mattingly.
[06:21.460 --> 06:23.080]  Shave your sideburns, Mattingly.
[06:23.080 --> 06:24.120]  And then he keeps going.
[06:24.260 --> 06:24.560]  It's good.
[06:25.120 --> 06:27.080]  There we got Geoff Heeran.
[06:28.020 --> 06:29.940]  Here in this show and nowhere else.
[06:31.120 --> 06:31.840]  Brad Havens.
[06:32.720 --> 06:35.000]  Here we got Gorman Thomas.
[06:35.240 --> 06:36.160]  That's a pretty good name.
[06:36.160 --> 06:37.640]  Dude, that last one was a bit Caleb-y.
[06:37.640 --> 06:37.820]  Gorman is a great name.
[06:37.900 --> 06:38.400]  What kind of...
[06:38.400 --> 06:39.080]  That is a little...
[06:39.540 --> 06:40.780]  Yeah, we'll put him in the Caleb.
[06:40.940 --> 06:41.160]  Okay.
[06:41.680 --> 06:42.140]  And then...
[06:42.900 --> 06:44.180]  What kind of name is Gorman?
[06:44.300 --> 06:45.260]  Gorman is a...
[06:45.260 --> 06:50.060]  I'm gonna say right now, that is the best fuck, fake, sprake shit first name I've seen so far.
[06:50.100 --> 06:50.460]  Gorman.
[06:50.460 --> 06:50.780]  Gorman.
[06:50.780 --> 06:53.260]  This is like the biggest name hit we've had.
[06:53.600 --> 06:56.840]  Gorman is Gaelic or Irish for small blue-eyed one.
[06:57.660 --> 06:58.180]  What?
[06:58.980 --> 06:59.840]  I'm not sure that was accurate.
[07:00.120 --> 07:00.180]  No.
[07:00.860 --> 07:01.520]  Oh, here's one.
[07:01.780 --> 07:02.320]  Gavin will like this.
[07:02.580 --> 07:03.520]  Greg Gross.
[07:03.860 --> 07:04.040]  Oh.
[07:04.560 --> 07:06.620]  And it's alliteration and it's funny.
[07:06.740 --> 07:07.500]  We'll put that over there too.
[07:07.540 --> 07:08.240]  We got some good names.
[07:08.420 --> 07:08.680]  Yeah.
[07:09.600 --> 07:11.160]  Spring Fever... whatever.
[07:13.420 --> 07:14.460]  Ted Simmons.
[07:15.700 --> 07:17.360]  Oh, Omar Moreno.
[07:17.620 --> 07:18.540]  That's a...
[07:18.540 --> 07:19.040]  That's a good look.
[07:19.460 --> 07:20.900]  Would Ted Simmons qualify for...
[07:20.900 --> 07:22.040]  He looks like he's going...
[07:24.140 --> 07:24.860]  I'm playing.
[07:25.280 --> 07:25.680]  I'm baseball.
[07:26.200 --> 07:27.580]  I'm on the baseball team.
[07:28.020 --> 07:31.000]  Have we had a smaller portion of the bat shown than that card?
[07:31.200 --> 07:32.020]  That's a bat knob.
[07:32.140 --> 07:32.860]  That's like...
[07:32.860 --> 07:33.620]  That's a bat knob.
[07:33.860 --> 07:34.860]  That's truly a bat knob.
[07:34.960 --> 07:35.660]  That's a bat handle.
[07:35.840 --> 07:36.040]  No, no.
[07:36.040 --> 07:36.660]  Are you looking at this one?
[07:36.820 --> 07:37.200]  Yes, yes.
[07:37.300 --> 07:38.440]  Oh, we got a knob shot.
[07:38.560 --> 07:39.080]  We'll save that.
[07:39.100 --> 07:40.720]  That might be 10% of the bat.
[07:40.860 --> 07:41.560]  That's a knob and handle.
[07:41.840 --> 07:42.740]  Oh, fucking, here we go.
[07:43.020 --> 07:43.640]  Steve Garvey.
[07:43.940 --> 07:44.300]  Here we go.
[07:44.440 --> 07:46.440]  We're learning about interesting 80s dudes.
[07:46.580 --> 07:47.660]  Read about Steve Garvey sometime.
[07:47.660 --> 07:48.660]  That's a stretch.
[07:48.720 --> 07:49.600]  He is...
[07:49.600 --> 07:50.620]  I thought that was a guy's head on the floor.
[07:50.620 --> 07:51.300]  The year...
[07:51.300 --> 07:53.660]  Like, him with the Padres there was...
[07:54.380 --> 07:54.900]  That's tough.
[07:55.340 --> 07:56.120]  Yeah, tough time.
[07:56.260 --> 07:57.660]  He's definitely not a Padres...
[07:58.280 --> 07:59.520]  Well, he's not like a Padre to me.
[08:00.100 --> 08:00.500]  Also...
[08:00.500 --> 08:01.300]  Well, he's a Dodger.
[08:01.740 --> 08:03.680]  So it's hard for me to take that.
[08:03.840 --> 08:05.900]  Also, if you ever listen to the...
[08:05.900 --> 08:07.820]  It's hard because their shit's not on Spotify.
[08:08.260 --> 08:10.700]  But if you ever listen to the punk band Angry Samoans,
[08:10.800 --> 08:11.960]  they have a song about...
[08:11.960 --> 08:12.160]  Yep.
[08:12.240 --> 08:13.500]  Features Steve Garvey pretty heavily.
[08:13.600 --> 08:14.080]  Yeah, check it out.
[08:14.160 --> 08:16.460]  It's like someone was stood in a hole and they turfed over him.
[08:17.860 --> 08:20.060]  I believe it's called Too Animalistic is the name of the song.
[08:20.480 --> 08:21.580]  Andy Van Slyke.
[08:22.020 --> 08:22.680]  That's a great name.
[08:22.900 --> 08:23.320]  Slyke.
[08:23.420 --> 08:24.480]  Anybody with Van in their name?
[08:26.920 --> 08:27.800]  Brian Clutterbuck.
[08:34.060 --> 08:35.940]  Brian fucking Clutterbuck.
[08:36.720 --> 08:37.600]  Holy shit.
[08:37.760 --> 08:38.240]  That's a good one.
[08:38.240 --> 08:39.000]  Mike Smithson.
[08:39.140 --> 08:40.000]  What a boring ass...
[08:40.000 --> 08:40.980]  That's a good mustache.
[08:41.100 --> 08:41.520]  That's a good mustache.
[08:41.960 --> 08:42.600]  That's a...
[08:42.600 --> 08:43.600]  That's a stepdad mustache.
[08:43.700 --> 08:45.080]  That's an A-plus stepdad mustache.
[08:45.080 --> 08:45.460]  Looking good.
[08:47.200 --> 08:48.360]  I did that one too.
[08:49.540 --> 08:50.260]  Jay Howell.
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.300]  Oh, Daryl Boston wearing classics white socks.
[08:53.320 --> 08:56.100]  Yeah, I love the classic A's and classic white socks jerseys like that.
[08:56.200 --> 08:57.500]  It's the V and they're not buttoned.
[08:57.560 --> 08:57.920]  I love it.
[08:58.060 --> 08:58.460]  I love that.
[08:58.720 --> 09:00.100]  And the ho-jo, Howard Johnson.
[09:00.240 --> 09:00.560]  Nice.
[09:00.980 --> 09:01.480]  Famous man.
[09:01.580 --> 09:02.280]  Alright, there you go.
[09:02.280 --> 09:02.840]  Off to a good start.
[09:02.900 --> 09:03.980]  We got a bunch of hits already.
[09:04.080 --> 09:05.140]  Got some great first names.
[09:05.200 --> 09:06.020]  No dentures yet.
[09:06.200 --> 09:06.880]  No dentures.
[09:07.040 --> 09:07.560]  We're dentureless.
[09:07.640 --> 09:08.200]  But that's okay.
[09:08.380 --> 09:08.860]  That's okay.
[09:09.200 --> 09:09.780]  We'll get there.
[09:10.920 --> 09:11.280]  What's...
[09:11.280 --> 09:12.600]  I don't even know where the dentures are.
[09:12.840 --> 09:13.880]  Where's the James Bond shit?
[09:15.420 --> 09:16.280]  I don't know where it is.
[09:16.600 --> 09:17.620]  Maybe next to Twin Peaks?
[09:17.620 --> 09:18.080]  Maybe.
[09:18.300 --> 09:18.900]  Maybe up in there.
[09:18.980 --> 09:20.360]  Why don't you get Twin Peaks going while we look?
[09:20.400 --> 09:21.060]  I'm looking at Twin Peaks.
[09:21.860 --> 09:22.540]  Everybody's favorite.
[09:23.240 --> 09:23.420]  Yeah.
[09:23.440 --> 09:25.680]  I was just reading today, actually, before I came in.
[09:25.720 --> 09:26.720]  We'll open two packs of Twin Peaks.
[09:27.180 --> 09:31.020]  That Inland Empire is getting an upscale, up-res remaster.
[09:31.080 --> 09:32.740]  Which is an insane thing to do for that movie.
[09:32.800 --> 09:34.460]  That movie was filmed at like 480p.
[09:34.500 --> 09:34.720]  Yes.
[09:34.800 --> 09:35.720]  Intentionally it looked like shit.
[09:35.780 --> 09:36.020]  Yes.
[09:37.120 --> 09:37.520]  It's...
[09:37.520 --> 09:38.840]  Is that...
[09:39.660 --> 09:41.900]  Maybe my least favorite movie I've ever seen.
[09:42.280 --> 09:44.200]  Here's the problem with Inland Empire.
[09:44.300 --> 09:44.520]  Uh-huh.
[09:46.100 --> 09:46.500]  I...
[09:46.500 --> 09:47.820]  You know how I feel about Charles Barkley.
[09:48.080 --> 09:48.200]  Uh-huh.
[09:48.260 --> 09:48.440]  Right?
[09:48.840 --> 09:50.900]  The only person on Earth...
[09:50.900 --> 09:54.960]  Two people on Earth I care more about than Charles Barkley would be...
[09:54.960 --> 09:57.740]  Would probably be David Lynch and Howard Stern.
[09:57.880 --> 09:58.060]  Okay.
[09:58.820 --> 10:00.360]  And then, of course, Don Rickles, but he died.
[10:02.520 --> 10:06.600]  I have loved David Lynch since I was 14 years old.
[10:08.640 --> 10:11.620]  Inland Empire is an unwatchable piece of garbage.
[10:11.780 --> 10:12.680]  An unwatchable...
[10:12.680 --> 10:16.100]  I have tried, as the world's biggest David Lynch fan,
[10:16.180 --> 10:20.960]  I have tried twice to watch that movie and fell asleep within the first 30 minutes both times.
[10:21.000 --> 10:22.700]  It, like, makes me feel sick to watch.
[10:22.980 --> 10:23.840]  I gotta watch it now.
[10:23.960 --> 10:24.740]  Oh, it's... yeah.
[10:24.900 --> 10:27.760]  It's seven hours long and it's filmed in VHS.
[10:28.140 --> 10:31.960]  It feels like if you've ever wanted to see...
[10:31.960 --> 10:33.720]  I don't remember if this is who's in it,
[10:33.780 --> 10:38.580]  but if you've ever wanted to see, like, Laura Dern shot in a fisheye lens this close,
[10:39.040 --> 10:40.440]  then Inland Empire is for you.
[10:40.460 --> 10:41.680]  While she's doing nothing.
[10:41.680 --> 10:42.360]  Nothing.
[10:42.540 --> 10:44.620]  Just going... and not having a comrade.
[10:44.780 --> 10:46.380]  It's the worst.
[10:46.520 --> 10:47.660]  I wanted to love it so bad.
[10:47.860 --> 10:50.680]  It's a lot of pieces that are pieced together not well.
[10:50.820 --> 10:51.880]  I could even sit down...
[10:51.880 --> 10:53.660]  I could watch The Straight Story five times in a row.
[10:53.780 --> 10:55.360]  Some people don't like that because it's a little family-friendly,
[10:55.500 --> 10:56.120]  but I don't give a fuck.
[10:56.220 --> 10:58.600]  Straight Story's awesome, but Inland Empire? Why?
[10:58.800 --> 11:01.080]  What about Dougie for 20 episodes?
[11:02.680 --> 11:03.980]  I would watch Dougie for 20 episodes.
[11:04.140 --> 11:06.140]  I would absolutely watch Dougie for 20 episodes.
[11:06.660 --> 11:07.420]  Alright, here we go.
[11:07.480 --> 11:09.400]  We got Norma and, uh, what's-his-face?
[11:09.400 --> 11:10.520]  Uh, Hank.
[11:10.960 --> 11:11.780]  Norma and Hank Jennings.
[11:12.040 --> 11:12.800]  Hank was in jail.
[11:13.300 --> 11:14.660]  Norma was running the, uh...
[11:14.660 --> 11:17.000]  Norma was running the damn fine coffee shop and, uh...
[11:17.000 --> 11:17.980]  I don't know what it's called.
[11:18.240 --> 11:19.580]  Do you know what the diner's called in Twin Peaks?
[11:19.720 --> 11:19.960]  No.
[11:20.480 --> 11:22.400]  Uh, maybe it says...
[11:23.780 --> 11:24.720]  It doesn't say.
[11:24.900 --> 11:26.480]  Anyway, Hank's a real piece of shit.
[11:26.640 --> 11:29.080]  He got out of jail and Norma was, uh...
[11:29.080 --> 11:30.160]  Well, it's a whole thing.
[11:30.640 --> 11:31.920]  Norma was actually in love with Ed.
[11:32.380 --> 11:34.940]  But Ed's married to Nadine, of course,
[11:35.000 --> 11:36.820]  and you don't want to fuck with Nadine because she's got superhuman strength.
[11:36.960 --> 11:37.760]  Yeah, she'll rip the...
[11:37.760 --> 11:38.520]  She'll rip your arms off.
[11:38.520 --> 11:40.720]  If you're riveted by this, check out...
[11:40.720 --> 11:41.380]  Twin Peaks, I guess.
[11:41.480 --> 11:43.280]  There's, uh, Sheriff Harry S. Truman,
[11:44.180 --> 11:44.940]  and, uh...
[11:44.940 --> 11:45.780]  What was that guy's name?
[11:46.240 --> 11:46.620]  Agent...
[11:47.900 --> 11:48.280]  Agent...
[11:48.980 --> 11:50.220]  Agent Guy from Robocop.
[11:50.240 --> 11:50.520]  Albert.
[11:50.700 --> 11:51.640]  That was it. Albert.
[11:51.700 --> 11:53.300]  I hate when we open the Twin Peaks card.
[11:53.300 --> 11:53.920]  Oh, there we go.
[11:54.040 --> 11:54.680]  There's, uh...
[11:54.680 --> 11:55.840]  There are, uh...
[11:55.840 --> 11:56.780]  There's, uh...
[11:56.780 --> 11:58.080]  Laura Palmer's parents.
[11:58.440 --> 11:59.140]  Silverhead, Leland.
[11:59.360 --> 12:00.700]  That's Leland and, uh...
[12:00.700 --> 12:01.200]  What is this one?
[12:01.240 --> 12:01.940]  This has been so long.
[12:02.000 --> 12:02.480]  Sarah Palmer.
[12:03.000 --> 12:03.640]  She's, uh...
[12:03.640 --> 12:04.260]  She's in a wheelchair.
[12:04.540 --> 12:05.220]  No, no, she's not.
[12:05.800 --> 12:06.300]  Did you watch Twin Peaks?
[12:06.300 --> 12:07.680]  I was thinking of, uh...
[12:07.680 --> 12:09.860]  I've watched some of Twin Peaks and don't get it.
[12:09.920 --> 12:11.520]  There's Ben Horn and that lady.
[12:11.920 --> 12:12.700]  And then...
[12:12.700 --> 12:13.600]  Oh, here we have, uh...
[12:13.600 --> 12:14.260]  Josie Packard.
[12:14.640 --> 12:15.520]  Uh, we've talked about her before.
[12:15.520 --> 12:18.520]  Every single one of these cards are two people being close to each other.
[12:18.520 --> 12:18.940]  Yeah, yeah.
[12:19.740 --> 12:22.700]  She's sad because she's about to become furniture.
[12:23.400 --> 12:25.320]  We've talked about Josie Packard before.
[12:25.480 --> 12:27.320]  She ends up, uh, becoming a doorknob.
[12:27.500 --> 12:27.740]  Uh-huh.
[12:28.060 --> 12:28.980]  Or a cabinet knob.
[12:29.360 --> 12:30.100]  Not a baseball knob.
[12:30.100 --> 12:31.020]  I think it's like a drawer knob.
[12:31.040 --> 12:31.660]  Drawer knob, yeah.
[12:32.080 --> 12:32.740]  So, there you go.
[12:32.780 --> 12:33.940]  Let's open one more pack of those.
[12:34.040 --> 12:34.980]  Oh, awesome!
[12:34.980 --> 12:39.080]  I bought one box of Twin Peaks cards a year ago and we're still opening them.
[12:39.320 --> 12:41.440]  Eric, why don't you pull out the characters as they come out?
[12:41.500 --> 12:42.280]  You got it.
[12:44.040 --> 12:44.740]  Can't wait.
[12:46.100 --> 12:46.980]  Alright, here we go.
[12:47.260 --> 12:48.380]  Oh, this one will be easy.
[12:50.600 --> 12:50.960]  Uh...
[12:50.960 --> 12:51.260]  Ooh.
[12:55.560 --> 12:56.580]  You know who that is.
[12:56.780 --> 12:58.560]  That's Hank. He runs the coffee shop.
[12:58.680 --> 12:59.720]  He just got out of jail.
[13:00.900 --> 13:02.060]  That's Lucy and Andy.
[13:02.520 --> 13:03.640]  Andy's a sheriff's deputy.
[13:03.720 --> 13:04.700]  Is he the one that cries a lot?
[13:04.700 --> 13:05.860]  Yeah, he cries a lot.
[13:06.280 --> 13:07.240]  He's very sensitive.
[13:07.380 --> 13:08.300]  She works the front desk.
[13:08.440 --> 13:09.360]  Yeah, she's the receptionist.
[13:09.400 --> 13:10.620]  And they're both dumb as shit.
[13:11.860 --> 13:12.660]  But endearing.
[13:12.900 --> 13:13.980]  They're like fun-dumb.
[13:14.440 --> 13:15.440]  They're like lovely-dumb.
[13:15.540 --> 13:16.040]  Oh, here we go.
[13:16.240 --> 13:18.920]  Here's Bobby and Ed at the gas station.
[13:19.060 --> 13:22.300]  Why are all of these characters two people close to each other?
[13:22.360 --> 13:22.980]  What's happening?
[13:23.860 --> 13:24.500]  Ooh, here we go.
[13:24.820 --> 13:25.140]  Here we go.
[13:25.200 --> 13:25.520]  Here's a...
[13:25.980 --> 13:27.060]  Some sort of a parallel.
[13:27.280 --> 13:27.400]  What?
[13:28.060 --> 13:29.040]  It's a map.
[13:29.660 --> 13:31.280]  Let me know if it's auto on card.
[13:31.820 --> 13:32.380]  It's not auto.
[13:32.660 --> 13:33.720]  That's Catherine Martel.
[13:33.860 --> 13:34.500]  Oh, my God.
[13:34.500 --> 13:37.900]  Her husband, he's dead, but he owned the...
[13:37.900 --> 13:38.700]  What do you call it?
[13:39.000 --> 13:40.020]  The mill, the lumber mill.
[13:40.160 --> 13:40.640]  Yeah, obviously.
[13:41.980 --> 13:43.740]  Catherine Martel sounds like a Game of Thrones name.
[13:44.060 --> 13:44.260]  Yeah.
[13:44.720 --> 13:45.120]  Yeah.
[13:45.160 --> 13:46.420]  Like she would betray one of the houses.
[13:46.820 --> 13:47.580]  Oh, you're gonna...
[13:47.580 --> 13:48.820]  Oh, this gets even better.
[13:49.400 --> 13:54.900]  This is Dale Cooper and Ed Hurley when they're on reconnaissance at the...
[13:54.900 --> 13:56.180]  What is that place called?
[13:56.200 --> 13:57.620]  The Whorehouse up in Canada.
[13:58.060 --> 13:59.840]  And it's called...
[14:00.380 --> 14:00.780]  Fuck.
[14:00.920 --> 14:01.880]  He looks like Weird Al.
[14:02.060 --> 14:02.980]  Like young Weird Al.
[14:03.600 --> 14:05.040]  It's called the...
[14:05.040 --> 14:05.940]  Well, I'll get back to it, but anyway.
[14:06.080 --> 14:08.280]  That's where like Renaud and all those people are from.
[14:08.580 --> 14:12.040]  Ed is in disguise with fake hair and a mustache.
[14:12.720 --> 14:15.280]  So nobody will ever know who he is in the same town that he's from.
[14:15.380 --> 14:15.960]  He looks like Weird Al.
[14:16.140 --> 14:16.620]  He does.
[14:16.900 --> 14:18.920]  And they're members of the Bookhouse Boys.
[14:19.220 --> 14:21.820]  When the cops can't get it done, the Bookhouse Boys do.
[14:22.080 --> 14:23.180]  They meet in the...
[14:23.180 --> 14:27.500]  They look like he's either part of a Weird Al cover band or he owns a whorehouse.
[14:27.640 --> 14:27.760]  Yeah.
[14:27.760 --> 14:29.880]  Those are the only two possible things he could do.
[14:30.380 --> 14:31.160]  And then we have...
[14:31.700 --> 14:36.080]  Oh, speaking of, there's his wife, Nadine, and Mike.
[14:36.520 --> 14:37.540]  This is when Nadine...
[14:37.540 --> 14:39.120]  She got hit on the head or something, I believe.
[14:39.520 --> 14:41.120]  And she thought she was a high school student again.
[14:41.280 --> 14:42.220]  She's about 45.
[14:42.460 --> 14:45.420]  She thought she was a cheerleader, so she walks around in a cheerleader outfit.
[14:45.720 --> 14:47.040]  And she decided she was in love with Mike.
[14:47.140 --> 14:48.500]  Or after she was like making drapes.
[14:48.620 --> 14:49.020]  What was she doing?
[14:49.140 --> 14:49.960]  That's season two stuff.
[14:50.060 --> 14:51.240]  I think it's around the drape time.
[14:51.460 --> 14:52.880]  It was when she was making the silent drape runners.
[14:53.140 --> 14:53.720]  That was it, yeah.
[14:54.040 --> 14:54.340]  I googled...
[14:54.340 --> 14:56.020]  I thought you were going to tell me that her eyepatch was Hank.
[14:57.660 --> 15:00.000]  I googled, are Twin Peaks cards worth anything?
[15:00.000 --> 15:01.640]  And I'm looking, and the answer is no.
[15:02.860 --> 15:04.720]  PRH, my hubby's whorehouse.
[15:05.660 --> 15:07.380]  My hubby's whorehouse.
[15:07.760 --> 15:08.620]  My hubby's whorehouse.
[15:11.580 --> 15:18.280]  I also bought, for fun, I bought some X-Files all new season three cards.
[15:18.300 --> 15:19.260]  All new season three?
[15:19.400 --> 15:20.180]  Yeah, season three.
[15:20.640 --> 15:25.000]  Look for 3D Holograms Etched Foil Paranormals Finest.
[15:25.020 --> 15:25.420]  That's cool.
[15:25.580 --> 15:26.260]  Randomly inserted.
[15:26.380 --> 15:27.100]  So maybe we'll get lucky.
[15:27.100 --> 15:30.920]  Everybody remember season three of the X-Files, right?
[15:30.940 --> 15:31.480]  Big season, that one.
[15:31.720 --> 15:33.460]  Probably had a CSM in there.
[15:34.240 --> 15:35.440]  I don't know, that was about it.
[15:36.040 --> 15:36.620]  Here we go.
[15:36.800 --> 15:39.360]  Here's David Duchovny solving a paranormal mystery.
[15:39.600 --> 15:40.320]  I bet it was aliens.
[15:41.020 --> 15:43.400]  It's just a man pointing a gun on a street.
[15:43.740 --> 15:44.360]  Oh, here's one.
[15:44.700 --> 15:45.300]  This is interesting.
[15:45.980 --> 15:46.880]  Get revenge on a bank.
[15:46.900 --> 15:47.980]  He looks like shit.
[15:48.600 --> 15:52.460]  The title of this is At the Center of a Cosmic G-Spot.
[15:53.180 --> 15:53.660]  Oh.
[15:53.660 --> 16:00.040]  And then on the back, we have a picture of Agent Dana Scully looking like...
[16:00.040 --> 16:01.280]  She can't believe it.
[16:02.420 --> 16:04.320]  Not her best photo.
[16:04.880 --> 16:06.260]  Oh, this one's good.
[16:06.500 --> 16:07.480]  You guys will like this one.
[16:08.420 --> 16:11.180]  These are all stuck together because they're 3,000 years old.
[16:11.580 --> 16:12.740]  Here we have...
[16:12.740 --> 16:14.040]  This is called...
[16:14.040 --> 16:17.020]  This is from the episode Reincarnation for Revenge, I guess.
[16:17.340 --> 16:18.060]  And that's...
[16:18.060 --> 16:18.280]  Ew.
[16:19.140 --> 16:19.800]  That's a face.
[16:20.200 --> 16:20.900]  Did he do that?
[16:21.280 --> 16:22.980]  Is that the effect of what he shot?
[16:23.500 --> 16:25.840]  Looks like bean hole beans, if I'm being honest.
[16:26.560 --> 16:27.280]  Is that...
[16:27.280 --> 16:28.400]  Yeah, I think Andrew's right.
[16:28.500 --> 16:30.820]  I think maybe the David Duchovny card is connected to this.
[16:30.900 --> 16:31.620]  Like that first card.
[16:33.680 --> 16:34.860]  These might be connected.
[16:35.180 --> 16:35.860]  That's what happened.
[16:36.300 --> 16:38.120]  Looks like a man that drank out of Andrew's cup.
[16:39.380 --> 16:40.600]  He opened this.
[16:40.820 --> 16:41.820]  And that's what was inside.
[16:41.980 --> 16:42.660]  There it is.
[16:43.280 --> 16:44.700]  Here's an alien autopsy photo.
[16:44.820 --> 16:45.300]  That's legit.
[16:45.340 --> 16:45.760]  Nice.
[16:45.760 --> 16:46.420]  You know that's real.
[16:47.520 --> 16:47.960]  Oh!
[16:49.080 --> 16:53.160]  If you're underage, hide your eyes, because there's some titty.
[16:53.720 --> 16:54.000]  Ew.
[16:54.320 --> 16:54.640]  What the...
[16:54.640 --> 16:55.740]  Some dead old titties.
[16:55.840 --> 16:56.960]  That's from X-Files?
[16:57.200 --> 16:58.260]  Yeah, that's X-Files Season 3.
[16:58.420 --> 16:59.600]  We all remember the titty episode.
[17:00.380 --> 17:01.040]  Here we go.
[17:01.080 --> 17:02.720]  Here's some art from Apocrypha.
[17:03.240 --> 17:03.620]  What?
[17:04.020 --> 17:04.800]  There we go.
[17:04.860 --> 17:05.420]  That's that one.
[17:05.520 --> 17:05.880]  Jesus.
[17:06.360 --> 17:07.860]  That guy's got beard bleed.
[17:08.280 --> 17:10.020]  Yeah, he's a...
[17:10.020 --> 17:11.280]  It's not even from X-Files.
[17:11.820 --> 17:12.320]  Yeah, it is.
[17:12.320 --> 17:13.260]  It's X on it.
[17:13.380 --> 17:14.260]  It does...
[17:14.260 --> 17:16.640]  It's from the 2-1696 episode.
[17:16.640 --> 17:18.760]  Chris Carter wrote that episode with Frank Spottnitz.
[17:18.960 --> 17:20.820]  It was directed by Kim Manners.
[17:21.480 --> 17:22.860]  Mulder brings fugitive...
[17:22.860 --> 17:23.680]  I'm not gonna read it.
[17:24.900 --> 17:26.120]  Here's another piece of art.
[17:26.140 --> 17:27.120]  It just took an office job.
[17:27.180 --> 17:28.180]  Here's another fucking piece of art.
[17:28.280 --> 17:28.720]  A lot of art.
[17:28.860 --> 17:29.340]  That's all boring.
[17:29.780 --> 17:30.260]  And then...
[17:30.260 --> 17:31.240]  Ooh, we got a lenticular.
[17:31.380 --> 17:32.320]  We got one of those special cards.
[17:32.360 --> 17:32.720]  Look at that.
[17:33.000 --> 17:33.400]  Wow.
[17:33.640 --> 17:34.840]  I can't even really see it.
[17:35.000 --> 17:35.400]  What is it?
[17:35.660 --> 17:37.140]  It looks like Mulder...
[17:37.140 --> 17:37.740]  I think this is the shittiest card.
[17:38.000 --> 17:39.400]  Mulder and someone else.
[17:39.520 --> 17:40.660]  That's a very 90s card.
[17:40.960 --> 17:42.380]  Yeah, it's super 90s.
[17:42.420 --> 17:43.320]  And it looks like a helicopter.
[17:43.600 --> 17:43.780]  Yeah.
[17:43.880 --> 17:45.120]  Oh, it's from Apocalypse Now.
[17:45.800 --> 17:46.360]  There you go.
[17:46.360 --> 17:47.940]  You think this is a scene from Apocalypse Now?
[17:47.940 --> 17:50.440]  Yeah, there's Agent Mulder and that's Robert Duvall, actually.
[17:50.680 --> 17:51.000]  Oh, cool.
[17:52.220 --> 17:53.360]  He's etched for...
[17:54.880 --> 17:55.840]  Andrew, you got text.
[17:58.440 --> 18:00.820]  Alright, the X-Files cards were awesome, as suspected.
[18:02.340 --> 18:03.980]  We also have a ton of mail.
[18:04.160 --> 18:05.220]  We just started opening.
[18:05.420 --> 18:05.680]  Okay.
[18:05.780 --> 18:06.520]  In the last couple episodes.
[18:12.360 --> 18:13.680]  That could have been important.
[18:13.780 --> 18:14.360]  Yeah, it could have been.
[18:14.360 --> 18:15.660]  That was in a...
[18:15.660 --> 18:16.200]  Yeah, it was.
[18:16.460 --> 18:16.840]  Shit.
[18:17.060 --> 18:17.480]  There you go.
[18:17.720 --> 18:18.380]  It's on this side.
[18:18.820 --> 18:19.380]  That's some of it.
[18:19.540 --> 18:19.900]  Oh, thanks.
[18:20.160 --> 18:21.200]  It was in a one-touch and everything.
[18:22.480 --> 18:22.860]  Somebody...
[18:23.440 --> 18:24.680]  A one-touch?
[18:25.660 --> 18:26.760]  That's what this case is called.
[18:27.040 --> 18:30.620]  That was from, I believe, that was from Elric.
[18:31.380 --> 18:32.200]  Thank you, Elric.
[18:32.840 --> 18:33.780]  We really appreciate it.
[18:33.800 --> 18:34.560]  We're not going to show your address.
[18:35.320 --> 18:37.580]  He got us a Bip Roberts.
[18:37.960 --> 18:38.320]  Wow!
[18:39.040 --> 18:39.640]  Is this sombrero?
[18:39.800 --> 18:40.080]  Oh!
[18:40.080 --> 18:41.660]  It's the Bip Roberts sombrero card.
[18:41.720 --> 18:42.100]  Nice.
[18:42.260 --> 18:42.640]  Classic.
[18:42.800 --> 18:44.780]  Considered one of the best baseball cards of all time.
[18:44.780 --> 18:45.420]  That's great.
[18:45.500 --> 18:46.420]  Gotta love it.
[18:46.440 --> 18:47.040]  Big Bip.
[18:47.400 --> 18:48.220]  It's a...
[18:48.220 --> 18:50.620]  Oh, and this is a dugout collection 96.
[18:50.820 --> 18:52.140]  I think this is actually some sort of a parallel.
[18:52.460 --> 18:52.660]  Nice.
[18:52.780 --> 18:53.900]  So even more valuable.
[18:54.440 --> 18:58.540]  And then he gave us two packs of Desert Storm cards that we are not going to open right now.
[18:58.680 --> 18:59.500]  But we'll throw them in the pack sack.
[18:59.520 --> 18:59.980]  Pack sack!
[19:00.240 --> 19:00.980]  For some other day.
[19:01.240 --> 19:02.020]  What else do we got?
[19:02.300 --> 19:02.960]  Here's a...
[19:02.960 --> 19:03.600]  That's a letter.
[19:04.720 --> 19:05.700]  Let's see what this one is.
[19:05.940 --> 19:08.160]  This one's from Gina.
[19:08.660 --> 19:09.500]  Thank you, Gina.
[19:09.860 --> 19:10.620]  Oh, Christ.
[19:11.340 --> 19:14.500]  Gina sent us a whole bunch of those Desert Storm cards.
[19:15.940 --> 19:16.720]  Here's what we're going to do.
[19:16.780 --> 19:19.300]  We're going to open one pack of Desert Storm cards.
[19:19.380 --> 19:20.100]  Did you ask for those?
[19:20.280 --> 19:20.500]  No.
[19:20.760 --> 19:22.560]  Two packs of Desert Storm cards from Gina.
[19:22.740 --> 19:23.140]  Thank you.
[19:23.260 --> 19:23.700]  We'll open...
[19:23.700 --> 19:25.920]  Well, actually, we'll put one in the pack sack, as you do.
[19:26.500 --> 19:27.300]  And we'll open this one.
[19:28.240 --> 19:29.320]  We got a lot to get through.
[19:29.380 --> 19:29.840]  What happened?
[19:30.880 --> 19:32.340]  This guy hit with a baseball bat or what?
[19:32.360 --> 19:35.180]  It probably got fucking shrapnel from the war.
[19:36.400 --> 19:37.260]  Let's see what we got.
[19:38.100 --> 19:42.840]  You know, some of these were in when we sold our wrist pocket, which sold out so fast, by the way.
[19:42.940 --> 19:43.260]  How many?
[19:43.760 --> 19:44.200]  49?
[19:44.720 --> 19:45.680]  There were only 49?
[19:45.900 --> 19:46.280]  There were about 10 of them.
[19:46.520 --> 19:49.300]  There were a bunch of Desert Storm cards that were stamped.
[19:49.580 --> 19:50.400]  Stamped Desert Storm cards.
[19:50.940 --> 19:51.440]  All right.
[19:51.760 --> 19:55.420]  You guys remember when we were flying high, like in our F-18.
[19:55.880 --> 19:56.320]  Great.
[19:56.480 --> 19:58.480]  How about Parachoopers in Flight?
[20:00.300 --> 20:01.340]  If you like parachutes...
[20:01.980 --> 20:02.440]  No, I don't.
[20:02.880 --> 20:06.060]  If you're into parachutes, keep listening to Fuckface.
[20:06.680 --> 20:09.820]  We got parachute content coming up in the next couple weeks.
[20:09.940 --> 20:10.480]  Already filmed.
[20:10.720 --> 20:12.520]  This is missing a part, right?
[20:12.520 --> 20:14.000]  That was...
[20:15.380 --> 20:17.000]  So there's a hole in his...
[20:17.000 --> 20:17.860]  Speedball.
[20:18.340 --> 20:23.300]  Because they were so widely produced, 1991 Topps Desert Storm trading cards remain easy to find.
[20:24.720 --> 20:26.300]  Here's an Army supply ship.
[20:26.600 --> 20:30.120]  Don't expect these cards to be worth much in the future, from a monetary standpoint.
[20:30.380 --> 20:31.380]  Here's the Airborne unit.
[20:31.660 --> 20:33.000]  Clearly not Airborne.
[20:33.580 --> 20:34.640]  Definitely on ground.
[20:34.680 --> 20:35.340]  Groundborne unit.
[20:35.660 --> 20:38.480]  That would be probably 82nd Airborne, I would imagine.
[20:38.760 --> 20:39.740]  Or the 101st.
[20:39.780 --> 20:41.020]  I can't tell which it is.
[20:42.360 --> 20:42.760]  82nd.
[20:42.760 --> 20:45.040]  I just saw yesterday that Joe Biden...
[20:45.040 --> 20:45.340]  Or today?
[20:45.480 --> 20:48.200]  Joe Biden was hanging out with the 82nd Airborne in Poland or somewhere.
[20:49.040 --> 20:51.300]  CH-53 Super Stallion.
[20:51.680 --> 20:52.280]  Here we go.
[20:52.300 --> 20:53.220]  He's a machine gunner.
[20:53.900 --> 20:55.020]  I wonder if that guy knows...
[20:57.060 --> 20:58.140]  Is this guy getting...
[20:58.140 --> 21:00.080]  Is the photographer getting shot at?
[21:00.840 --> 21:01.920]  I wonder if...
[21:01.920 --> 21:05.740]  I was an Army photographer, and let me tell you, we were expendable.
[21:06.760 --> 21:08.480]  Would you ever have stood there to get that shot?
[21:08.560 --> 21:08.820]  Yes.
[21:09.040 --> 21:09.840]  I would have been made to.
[21:11.140 --> 21:11.940]  Jesus Christ.
[21:12.200 --> 21:13.680]  EA-6B Prowler.
[21:13.880 --> 21:15.080]  On the prowl.
[21:15.220 --> 21:16.400]  Except it's on the ground as well.
[21:16.920 --> 21:17.720]  Maybe it's creeping.
[21:18.760 --> 21:20.440]  Here's the Marine Firefighters.
[21:20.800 --> 21:21.600]  Fighting those fires.
[21:21.940 --> 21:22.840]  What the fuck?
[21:23.160 --> 21:23.620]  It's like...
[21:23.620 --> 21:24.400]  That looks like X-Files.
[21:24.740 --> 21:26.540]  It's a few different people named these cards.
[21:27.060 --> 21:29.220]  Like, one who is super knowledgeable, one that knows nothing.
[21:29.380 --> 21:31.000]  Like, it's just a visual of like...
[21:31.000 --> 21:32.060]  It's Marine Firefighters.
[21:32.120 --> 21:32.840]  Go to the one before it.
[21:33.600 --> 21:35.560]  It's a full fucking game of the jet.
[21:35.740 --> 21:37.220]  The next one is a machine gunner.
[21:37.280 --> 21:37.640]  I don't know.
[21:37.720 --> 21:38.960]  It's just a guy with a machine gun.
[21:38.960 --> 21:39.840]  It really is.
[21:40.040 --> 21:41.220]  These are made by two different people.
[21:41.660 --> 21:42.380]  Here's a...
[21:44.060 --> 21:45.900]  Oh, you're supposed to display this proudly.
[21:46.040 --> 21:47.400]  Peel carefully, display proudly.
[21:47.560 --> 21:47.880]  Of course.
[21:48.260 --> 21:50.560]  This is the 34th Armor Division.
[21:50.920 --> 21:51.080]  See?
[21:51.260 --> 21:52.020]  Oh, I'll put that on my laptop.
[21:52.020 --> 21:52.900]  Let me show it to the audience.
[21:52.920 --> 21:53.460]  Put it on your car.
[21:53.640 --> 21:54.700]  Does anybody know...
[21:54.700 --> 21:58.440]  Does anybody know what the 34th Armor Division's motto is?
[22:01.180 --> 22:02.980]  The strong arm for victory.
[22:03.440 --> 22:04.960]  Eric, you can stick that somewhere if you want.
[22:05.160 --> 22:05.840]  I have...
[22:05.840 --> 22:09.000]  We have Beanie Babies cards forever ago with little stickers.
[22:09.120 --> 22:10.260]  I still have it on my laptop.
[22:10.460 --> 22:10.580]  Do you?
[22:10.700 --> 22:11.680]  You're going to commit to that bigger one?
[22:11.760 --> 22:12.380]  It's going to be right here.
[22:13.200 --> 22:13.600]  Love it.
[22:13.940 --> 22:15.160]  Let's move on to...
[22:15.160 --> 22:16.040]  Let's see what's in this one.
[22:16.320 --> 22:16.880]  This one's another...
[22:18.240 --> 22:21.780]  Doing a little bit of fuckface open shit until we break shit.
[22:25.180 --> 22:26.880]  It really, on the sticker, says display...
[22:27.460 --> 22:29.020]  Peel carefully, display proudly.
[22:30.000 --> 22:30.700]  Oh, shit.
[22:30.760 --> 22:31.100]  Here we go.
[22:31.120 --> 22:31.580]  This is some good stuff.
[22:31.680 --> 22:32.060]  It's huge.
[22:32.240 --> 22:32.820]  Hello, all.
[22:32.820 --> 22:34.100]  Comment leaver of the Twins here.
[22:34.200 --> 22:35.120]  Oh, it's Jessica and Jennifer.
[22:35.380 --> 22:35.460]  Nice.
[22:35.860 --> 22:37.920]  We saw these cards and thought we should send them in.
[22:37.960 --> 22:38.260]  Thank you.
[22:38.340 --> 22:39.140]  Oh, I love you guys.
[22:39.200 --> 22:39.900]  Thank you so much.
[22:40.120 --> 22:41.100]  The Twins are the best.
[22:41.380 --> 22:44.420]  Huge supporters of Annual Pass, the less popular podcast I do.
[22:45.260 --> 22:47.420]  They sent us...
[22:48.540 --> 22:52.340]  Maltets NHL, which is fucking awesome, and Lion King Series 2.
[22:52.560 --> 22:56.660]  Andrew, if you had to say that Gonzo played for an NHL team, what team would it be?
[22:58.160 --> 23:02.780]  I believe Gonzo is on the Canucks.
[23:02.980 --> 23:03.180]  Nice.
[23:03.340 --> 23:04.800]  I would have said Canadian team as well.
[23:05.120 --> 23:05.300]  Yeah.
[23:06.280 --> 23:08.160]  Let's see what we've got in the Lion King.
[23:08.220 --> 23:08.660]  We've got...
[23:10.300 --> 23:11.260]  Here's a bird.
[23:12.280 --> 23:13.160]  And a mountain.
[23:13.460 --> 23:14.140]  That looks like...
[23:14.140 --> 23:16.240]  That looks like Halo 3.
[23:17.260 --> 23:19.000]  That looks like Halo 3?
[23:19.320 --> 23:19.540]  Yeah.
[23:20.000 --> 23:20.680]  Rowan Atkinson?
[23:21.180 --> 23:22.420]  That says Zuzu, right?
[23:22.560 --> 23:23.520]  Flying over to...
[23:23.520 --> 23:23.740]  Yeah.
[23:23.860 --> 23:25.120]  And there's a...
[23:25.120 --> 23:26.640]  That looks like Halo 3.
[23:27.220 --> 23:28.320]  Ooh, here we go.
[23:28.540 --> 23:29.580]  Look at this.
[23:31.240 --> 23:32.700]  They're fucking going at it.
[23:32.820 --> 23:33.760]  These cats are going to kiss.
[23:34.040 --> 23:35.140]  Oh, this one's...
[23:35.140 --> 23:36.260]  Kitty's got claws.
[23:36.980 --> 23:38.840]  This one appears to be...
[23:38.840 --> 23:40.440]  Simba and...
[23:40.440 --> 23:41.340]  No, that's like the dad.
[23:41.380 --> 23:42.200]  D-Bossed or something.
[23:42.340 --> 23:43.100]  What the...
[23:43.100 --> 23:44.280]  That's not from the movie.
[23:45.000 --> 23:45.760]  It's not not from the movie.
[23:45.760 --> 23:46.800]  Like the storyboard sketch.
[23:47.060 --> 23:47.260]  Yeah.
[23:47.660 --> 23:51.760]  It's a king and his heir from the art of the Lion King by Hyperion.
[23:51.920 --> 23:53.420]  Storyboard art by Bernie Mattinson.
[23:54.600 --> 23:55.060]  Lovely.
[23:56.060 --> 23:56.600]  Save that one.
[23:57.580 --> 23:58.200]  For what?
[23:58.560 --> 23:59.320]  Yeah, why?
[23:59.960 --> 24:00.980]  Oh, I can't...
[24:00.980 --> 24:01.660]  It feels cool.
[24:01.680 --> 24:02.120]  It feels different.
[24:02.260 --> 24:02.700]  Like, touch it.
[24:02.800 --> 24:04.040]  Yeah, but what category is that?
[24:05.020 --> 24:05.560]  Good feels.
[24:05.920 --> 24:06.520]  Good feels.
[24:06.520 --> 24:06.980]  Good feels.
[24:07.500 --> 24:08.100]  Thank you, Emily.
[24:08.220 --> 24:08.580]  Good feels.
[24:09.320 --> 24:09.640]  Sensory.
[24:09.800 --> 24:10.620]  Let's have a go on this feel.
[24:11.220 --> 24:11.880]  It's a good feel.
[24:12.260 --> 24:13.580]  Oh, all right.
[24:13.580 --> 24:14.220]  That's a pretty good feel.
[24:14.620 --> 24:15.180]  All right, take it back.
[24:15.660 --> 24:16.060]  It's a good feel.
[24:16.200 --> 24:16.520]  All right.
[24:16.560 --> 24:17.160]  It's embossed.
[24:17.200 --> 24:20.220]  We're going to go ahead and open two packs of Muppets on the ice, and then we're going
[24:20.220 --> 24:22.280]  to put one in the pack sack, as you do.
[24:22.300 --> 24:23.000]  You got to feed the pack.
[24:23.180 --> 24:26.200]  Do you think it's going to have, like, I think Kermit's on the LA Kings.
[24:26.740 --> 24:28.040]  He would be in LA Kings.
[24:28.160 --> 24:28.180]  Yeah.
[24:28.640 --> 24:29.040]  Yeah.
[24:29.180 --> 24:30.300]  What would Animal be on?
[24:30.520 --> 24:31.060]  Mighty Ducks.
[24:31.640 --> 24:34.740]  He's a goon, but probably for, like, the Flyers.
[24:35.000 --> 24:35.580]  Bruins, maybe.
[24:35.580 --> 24:37.020]  Yeah, like the red...
[24:37.020 --> 24:37.720]  Like, you know what I mean?
[24:37.880 --> 24:38.620]  He's like a...
[24:39.040 --> 24:39.440]  He's...
[24:39.440 --> 24:40.360]  It's like...
[24:40.360 --> 24:41.480]  He's like a Brad Marshall type of dude.
[24:41.480 --> 24:41.780]  Yeah, yeah.
[24:42.340 --> 24:43.880]  He's, like, slamming dudes.
[24:44.640 --> 24:46.060]  I'm excited to see what these cards are all about.
[24:46.060 --> 24:47.000]  I'm so jazzed about this.
[24:47.240 --> 24:47.440]  Let's do it.
[24:47.540 --> 24:48.500]  Fozzie's a goalie.
[24:48.700 --> 24:48.900]  What?
[24:48.900 --> 24:49.500]  Of course.
[24:49.840 --> 24:50.460]  He likes to catch.
[24:50.500 --> 24:51.740]  Oh, that's not...
[24:51.740 --> 24:52.720]  You got a pillow.
[24:53.320 --> 24:53.960]  And we got a...
[24:53.960 --> 24:55.840]  There's a face-off between...
[24:55.840 --> 24:55.940]  Yeah!
[24:56.160 --> 24:57.120]  Animal and Gonzo.
[24:57.320 --> 24:58.100]  That's cool.
[24:59.900 --> 25:00.340]  Goal!
[25:00.780 --> 25:01.060]  See?
[25:01.420 --> 25:01.440]  Of course.
[25:01.560 --> 25:02.880]  Well, that's Kermit from the box.
[25:02.920 --> 25:03.980]  Oh, this is awesome.
[25:04.540 --> 25:04.660]  Yeah.
[25:04.720 --> 25:06.360]  Here's a Toronto Maple Leafs card.
[25:06.520 --> 25:06.960]  Miss Piggy.
[25:07.980 --> 25:08.420]  Yeah.
[25:09.520 --> 25:10.700]  Does that track, Andrew?
[25:11.920 --> 25:13.080]  It does, yeah.
[25:13.560 --> 25:16.280]  Are the Maple Leafs mostly pigs?
[25:17.400 --> 25:18.140]  Here we go.
[25:18.240 --> 25:19.500]  Animal's a Tampa Bay Lightning.
[25:19.700 --> 25:20.140]  What?
[25:20.320 --> 25:21.480]  I think they just say Tampa now.
[25:21.600 --> 25:22.000]  Wow.
[25:22.580 --> 25:23.620]  Detroit Red Wings.
[25:24.400 --> 25:25.120]  Kermit, huh?
[25:25.280 --> 25:25.820]  Oh, Kermit.
[25:25.820 --> 25:26.840]  Kermit is a Detroit.
[25:27.060 --> 25:27.760]  Wow, that's crazy.
[25:27.860 --> 25:28.680]  Oh, here you go, Andrew.
[25:28.860 --> 25:30.000]  Close to you, kind of.
[25:30.260 --> 25:31.240]  Montreal Canadiens.
[25:31.240 --> 25:31.540]  Montreal Canadiens.
[25:31.580 --> 25:32.140]  All right.
[25:32.280 --> 25:34.140]  And then here's the Pittsburgh Penguins.
[25:35.280 --> 25:36.400]  So, animal plays for...
[25:36.400 --> 25:36.800]  Oh, okay.
[25:37.440 --> 25:38.080]  That's awesome.
[25:38.680 --> 25:39.420]  That's a tattoo.
[25:39.640 --> 25:40.500]  Animal's on two teams, right?
[25:41.080 --> 25:43.140]  Yeah, so animal's on the Canadiens and the...
[25:43.140 --> 25:43.960]  Dude, straight up.
[25:43.980 --> 25:44.520]  Maybe you're right.
[25:44.840 --> 25:46.260]  That Gonzo one, that's a tattoo.
[25:46.380 --> 25:46.660]  That is.
[25:46.680 --> 25:47.760]  That is a great tattoo.
[25:48.180 --> 25:49.180]  That's really cool.
[25:49.600 --> 25:52.660]  If you're a Montreal Canadiens fan, if you don't have a Gonzo...
[25:52.660 --> 25:53.660]  You gotta get...
[25:53.660 --> 25:54.280]  What's a Pittsburgh...
[25:54.280 --> 25:55.440]  It's Pittsburgh Penguins.
[25:55.600 --> 25:55.780]  He's a Pittsburgh Penguins.
[25:55.780 --> 25:56.360]  That's a...
[25:56.360 --> 25:57.380]  That's him as a Pittsburgh Penguin.
[25:58.260 --> 25:59.200]  You can see on the...
[25:59.200 --> 25:59.420]  Oh, yeah.
[25:59.420 --> 25:59.940]  Pittsburgh Penguins.
[26:00.160 --> 26:01.200]  You don't have to show me.
[26:01.300 --> 26:02.120]  I'm telling you.
[26:03.640 --> 26:04.600]  It's a Pittsburgh Penguin.
[26:04.840 --> 26:05.260]  It's a Pittsburgh Penguin.
[26:05.320 --> 26:05.960]  Yeah, there you go.
[26:05.960 --> 26:06.440]  Pittsburgh Penguins.
[26:06.860 --> 26:07.220]  There you go.
[26:07.520 --> 26:08.220]  You should get that tattoo.
[26:08.880 --> 26:09.820]  People of Pittsburgh.
[26:11.240 --> 26:12.120]  Here's Gonzo.
[26:13.940 --> 26:15.440]  You don't have anything else going on?
[26:15.460 --> 26:17.820]  Have a couple irons and get one of those tattoos.
[26:18.120 --> 26:18.360]  Yeah.
[26:20.040 --> 26:20.640]  Tattoos are good.
[26:20.900 --> 26:24.980]  I like the idea of the Muppets getting folded into, like, hockey mascots.
[26:24.980 --> 26:26.360]  These cards are...
[26:26.360 --> 26:28.280]  Jennifer and Jessica, these are some of the best cards we've ever opened.
[26:28.280 --> 26:29.400]  Do they have, like, Muppets baseball?
[26:29.540 --> 26:30.640]  I'd love to see a Muppets baseball.
[26:30.760 --> 26:31.360]  Here's Roughing.
[26:31.980 --> 26:32.880]  They only have hockey.
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.140]  Whoa, Miss Piggy just roughed them all.
[26:35.220 --> 26:35.920]  Dog pile.
[26:36.780 --> 26:38.420]  Don't rough me next, Miss Piggy.
[26:38.600 --> 26:38.980]  Hooking.
[26:39.700 --> 26:42.040]  Apparently, an animal does some hooking on the side.
[26:42.060 --> 26:42.580]  Is there a...
[26:42.580 --> 26:44.680]  Named by the same guy that did the Desert Storm cards?
[26:45.380 --> 26:46.120]  Machine gunner?
[26:46.120 --> 26:46.860]  Oh, no.
[26:46.880 --> 26:48.440]  Very similar pose to the other one.
[26:48.460 --> 26:48.700]  Yes.
[26:49.200 --> 26:51.120]  I always suspected this of Miss Piggy.
[26:51.600 --> 26:52.400]  Extremely right wing.
[26:52.940 --> 26:53.340]  Oh.
[26:54.320 --> 26:54.540]  Oh.
[26:54.540 --> 26:55.240]  Very right wing.
[26:55.460 --> 26:57.080]  I had an idea.
[26:57.360 --> 26:57.580]  Oh.
[26:58.160 --> 26:59.200]  You hate to see it?
[26:59.320 --> 26:59.500]  Uh-huh.
[26:59.680 --> 27:00.980]  Or maybe you love to see it.
[27:01.340 --> 27:01.840]  Here we go.
[27:01.900 --> 27:02.720]  Ottawa Senators.
[27:03.000 --> 27:03.220]  Uh-huh.
[27:03.540 --> 27:04.500]  That's a lovely one, too.
[27:04.560 --> 27:05.300]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[27:06.080 --> 27:06.680]  Oh, Andrew.
[27:06.780 --> 27:07.640]  I'll save this one for last.
[27:07.740 --> 27:08.180]  And this one.
[27:08.560 --> 27:09.500]  Oh, here's another one.
[27:10.600 --> 27:11.360]  Philadelphia Flyers.
[27:11.600 --> 27:12.140]  There's a Gonzo.
[27:12.360 --> 27:12.660]  That's good.
[27:12.660 --> 27:13.200]  These tattoos...
[27:13.200 --> 27:13.860]  These are great.
[27:14.020 --> 27:14.960]  These are cool, I guess.
[27:14.960 --> 27:16.020]  These tattoos are great.
[27:16.380 --> 27:17.360]  Toronto Maple Leafs.
[27:17.360 --> 27:17.920]  I already got that one.
[27:17.920 --> 27:18.420]  There she is.
[27:19.340 --> 27:22.740]  And then here is Fozzie the Bear as a Canuck.
[27:23.240 --> 27:23.620]  Wow!
[27:23.620 --> 27:24.640]  That's for you, Andrew.
[27:24.660 --> 27:26.580]  Oh, it's the old skate logo, too?
[27:26.780 --> 27:28.040]  That's a great logo.
[27:28.060 --> 27:29.780]  How come he's dropping all the pucks?
[27:30.340 --> 27:30.700]  Even...
[27:30.700 --> 27:31.260]  That's Fozzie.
[27:32.020 --> 27:32.820]  Even better...
[27:33.600 --> 27:34.400]  Another Fozzie.
[27:34.760 --> 27:35.160]  Wow!
[27:35.840 --> 27:36.920]  Waka waka, y'all.
[27:37.820 --> 27:38.540]  Waka waka.
[27:38.720 --> 27:39.540]  When did this...
[27:39.540 --> 27:40.580]  Like the late 90s?
[27:40.780 --> 27:41.020]  Yeah.
[27:41.120 --> 27:41.540]  Yeah, probably.
[27:42.180 --> 27:43.280]  These have to be probably like...
[27:43.280 --> 27:43.580]  98?
[27:44.180 --> 27:44.580]  98?
[27:45.120 --> 27:47.640]  Every card in that entire box is a hit.
[27:47.660 --> 27:48.440]  Those are...
[27:48.440 --> 27:49.880]  What a great find.
[27:50.640 --> 27:51.060]  That was enjoyable.
[27:51.360 --> 27:51.560]  That was a great find.
[27:51.640 --> 27:52.300]  Those are awesome.
[27:52.460 --> 27:53.300]  Jennifer and Jessica, thank you so much.
[27:53.300 --> 27:53.600]  Thank you.
[27:53.600 --> 27:54.740]  That's a good send.
[27:54.800 --> 27:56.320]  Best gift we've ever had right there.
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.380]  Speaking of best gifts we've ever had, let's open one more.
[27:59.520 --> 28:00.180]  Let's open this one.
[28:00.320 --> 28:03.180]  Speaking of best gifts we've ever had, let's see what this is.
[28:03.440 --> 28:04.700]  We're gonna assume that this one is.
[28:05.420 --> 28:07.200]  We're gonna blind box challenge this.
[28:07.340 --> 28:07.860]  Fucking bold.
[28:09.780 --> 28:10.700]  Looks like letters.
[28:11.820 --> 28:12.640]  Words and reading.
[28:13.020 --> 28:14.060]  Oh, it's a card.
[28:16.560 --> 28:17.920]  And in it we have...
[28:17.920 --> 28:19.000]  Ooh, good stuff.
[28:19.100 --> 28:20.960]  Alright, this is from Katie, thank you.
[28:22.380 --> 28:23.560]  She says, or they say...
[28:29.740 --> 28:31.300]  Excellent penmanship on Katie, by the way.
[28:31.360 --> 28:31.920]  Let's put these here.
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.520]  Hit the button for the name of the show.
[28:33.720 --> 28:33.760]  Oh, yeah.
[28:34.080 --> 28:34.600]  Thank you.
[28:35.680 --> 28:39.340]  Thank you for being a constant through college and veterinary school for me.
[28:39.500 --> 28:40.500]  I'll be graduating in May.
[28:40.600 --> 28:41.040]  Congratulations, by the way.
[28:41.100 --> 28:42.000]  Might be a personal letter.
[28:42.240 --> 28:43.160]  Yeah, it really sounds like it.
[28:43.340 --> 28:44.760]  Just straight up reading it out loud.
[28:45.440 --> 28:48.200]  As you just said, enjoy these old cards I found in a dusty store in Portland, Oregon.
[28:48.260 --> 28:48.920]  Thank you for everything.
[28:49.060 --> 28:49.580]  Thank you.
[28:50.460 --> 28:51.600]  Really appreciate that.
[28:51.680 --> 28:52.360]  That's very sweet of you.
[28:52.460 --> 28:55.420]  We've got Dick Tracy and Sergeant Pepper's Hearts Club Band.
[28:55.640 --> 28:55.900]  Oh, wow.
[28:56.040 --> 28:57.400]  I feel like we might have opened those before.
[28:57.880 --> 28:58.620]  I guess we'll find out.
[28:59.500 --> 29:00.280]  Dick Tracy.
[29:04.120 --> 29:06.500]  We've got Wanted Assault and Battery.
[29:07.640 --> 29:08.120]  We've got...
[29:08.120 --> 29:08.340]  Itchy?
[29:10.160 --> 29:11.080]  Observed from above.
[29:11.780 --> 29:13.960]  That guy's name was Jake Itchy Ross?
[29:14.680 --> 29:15.000]  What?
[29:15.800 --> 29:17.220]  Jake Itchy Ross.
[29:17.220 --> 29:17.600]  Rossy.
[29:17.880 --> 29:18.160]  Okay.
[29:18.240 --> 29:18.680]  Here we go.
[29:20.540 --> 29:22.460]  Abducted by Big Boy from OutKast.
[29:23.460 --> 29:25.220]  He's my favorite member of OutKast, actually.
[29:25.360 --> 29:26.620]  Saved by Andre 3000.
[29:28.060 --> 29:29.400]  Behave yourself, kid.
[29:30.380 --> 29:30.640]  No!
[29:32.460 --> 29:33.540]  Is that Warren Beatty?
[29:33.640 --> 29:34.540]  He dated Madonna, right?
[29:34.660 --> 29:35.440]  Around the time this came out?
[29:35.500 --> 29:35.580]  Yeah.
[29:36.380 --> 29:37.960]  There's Jake Itchy Rossy again.
[29:38.000 --> 29:39.560]  It's insane that they made this movie.
[29:39.780 --> 29:40.640]  Captive Crime Fighter.
[29:40.740 --> 29:41.380]  I never saw it.
[29:41.460 --> 29:41.820]  Was it good?
[29:42.040 --> 29:42.380]  No.
[29:42.800 --> 29:44.600]  Uh-oh, somebody crashed the poker party.
[29:44.700 --> 29:45.200]  Look at it.
[29:45.340 --> 29:46.400]  Does it look good?
[29:46.440 --> 29:47.160]  It doesn't, though.
[29:47.720 --> 29:50.020]  A ride into danger, and...
[29:50.460 --> 29:51.360]  Tracy, watch out!
[29:52.300 --> 29:52.560]  What?
[29:53.040 --> 29:54.000]  Tracy, watch out!
[29:54.180 --> 29:54.300]  Oh.
[29:54.400 --> 29:59.480]  It seems like a thing where somebody had the ownership of the IP, and they're like, we gotta make this.
[29:59.620 --> 29:59.720]  Yeah.
[29:59.740 --> 30:02.100]  And then they're like, well, if we're gonna make it, let's make it right.
[30:02.180 --> 30:04.000]  And then they made it, and they went, oh, no.
[30:04.280 --> 30:05.180]  Oh, no.
[30:05.820 --> 30:06.700]  We made it wrong.
[30:06.880 --> 30:08.000]  We didn't make it right.
[30:08.500 --> 30:10.120]  Here's our Beatles, Sgt. Pepper.
[30:10.160 --> 30:10.400]  Alright.
[30:10.760 --> 30:11.780]  I've also never seen that.
[30:12.780 --> 30:13.280]  What's that?
[30:13.420 --> 30:14.340]  The movie, Sgt. Pepper.
[30:14.980 --> 30:15.640]  It's so long.
[30:15.860 --> 30:16.640]  It feels so long.
[30:16.640 --> 30:17.860]  That gum is on there.
[30:18.100 --> 30:18.200]  Yeah?
[30:18.280 --> 30:18.520]  Good.
[30:18.640 --> 30:19.500]  What do we have here?
[30:20.160 --> 30:21.000]  Clowns at the benefit.
[30:21.220 --> 30:22.460]  I assume that's something from the movie.
[30:22.540 --> 30:23.960]  It looks like a big-ass hamburger in the back.
[30:24.260 --> 30:24.880]  That's pretty cool.
[30:25.060 --> 30:25.800]  Biggest burger.
[30:26.620 --> 30:26.960]  Put that in there.
[30:27.020 --> 30:27.840]  Andrew, could you eat that?
[30:29.240 --> 30:29.820]  Eat what?
[30:29.920 --> 30:30.100]  Sorry?
[30:30.200 --> 30:30.880]  Could I see the card again?
[30:31.040 --> 30:31.120]  Yeah.
[30:33.500 --> 30:34.060]  Oh, yeah.
[30:34.520 --> 30:34.840]  Easy.
[30:35.200 --> 30:35.640]  Oh, okay.
[30:36.500 --> 30:36.920]  No problem.
[30:36.920 --> 30:37.080]  How long?
[30:37.380 --> 30:37.720]  26 hours?
[30:37.760 --> 30:38.600]  44 hours.
[30:39.260 --> 30:39.520]  Lucy in the sky.
[30:39.540 --> 30:40.480]  Wait, are there pickles on it?
[30:41.380 --> 30:42.060]  No pickles.
[30:42.280 --> 30:42.880]  You'll get it no pickles.
[30:43.240 --> 30:44.000]  Oh, easy.
[30:44.140 --> 30:44.620]  Yeah, no problem.
[30:44.620 --> 30:45.840]  There's some fucking people.
[30:46.740 --> 30:48.440]  I think those are the Bee Gees.
[30:48.820 --> 30:49.160]  Those are the Bee Gees.
[30:49.660 --> 30:51.020]  There's more Bee Gees.
[30:52.300 --> 30:53.300]  This is...
[30:53.300 --> 30:54.320]  I don't know.
[30:55.020 --> 30:55.560]  That lady.
[30:56.820 --> 30:57.380]  Donna Summer?
[30:58.560 --> 30:59.060]  Donna?
[30:59.160 --> 30:59.960]  Donna Sterling.
[31:00.160 --> 31:00.180]  Oh.
[31:02.740 --> 31:03.620]  Here's that.
[31:04.900 --> 31:07.320]  And then Aerosmith as the future villains.
[31:07.480 --> 31:07.880]  I agree.
[31:09.440 --> 31:10.480]  The future villains.
[31:10.480 --> 31:11.660]  And that one comes with gum.
[31:12.120 --> 31:14.180]  That gum is load-bearing.
[31:14.180 --> 31:14.860]  You can get that off.
[31:15.220 --> 31:16.060]  You can do it.
[31:16.260 --> 31:17.080]  Gavin can get it off.
[31:18.580 --> 31:19.280]  He's doing it.
[31:19.320 --> 31:19.460]  Look.
[31:19.780 --> 31:20.260]  Watch this.
[31:21.180 --> 31:22.120]  Don't ruin the card.
[31:22.340 --> 31:23.160]  Not onto the camera, though.
[31:25.140 --> 31:25.540]  Nope.
[31:25.560 --> 31:26.760]  Here's your ASMR for the day.
[31:27.240 --> 31:27.760]  Our ASMR.
[31:29.340 --> 31:29.740]  Oh!
[31:29.900 --> 31:30.880]  You can't eat that.
[31:31.440 --> 31:33.300]  That is very offensive cards.
[31:34.580 --> 31:35.720]  Future villains, no!
[31:36.220 --> 31:36.700]  I like it.
[31:37.460 --> 31:37.700]  Ooh.
[31:38.100 --> 31:38.500]  I hear it.
[31:38.560 --> 31:38.880]  It's in your mouth.
[31:39.180 --> 31:39.400]  Ooh.
[31:39.880 --> 31:40.900]  Oh, it's held together.
[31:41.080 --> 31:41.540]  It snapped.
[31:41.900 --> 31:45.880]  Before we get into the more serious sports cards that I give a shit about.
[31:46.020 --> 31:46.380]  Uh-huh.
[31:46.760 --> 31:49.220]  I found out that today's cats are interns last day.
[31:49.400 --> 31:49.620]  That's right.
[31:49.720 --> 31:50.460]  Eric's interns last day.
[31:50.560 --> 31:50.620]  Yes.
[31:50.700 --> 31:51.380]  Not our, your intern.
[31:51.600 --> 31:52.320]  You weren't an intern.
[31:52.400 --> 31:53.140]  Not the rest of us, somehow.
[31:53.760 --> 31:58.700]  And so, in honor of Cat, because Cat's like the world's biggest One Direction fan.
[31:58.780 --> 31:59.620]  Uh-huh.
[32:00.020 --> 32:01.640]  One Direction bedsheets.
[32:01.880 --> 32:04.900]  She met Shawn Mendes during South by Southwest.
[32:05.140 --> 32:05.960]  Not in One Direction?
[32:06.000 --> 32:06.240]  No.
[32:06.300 --> 32:06.520]  No.
[32:06.800 --> 32:08.640]  No, but in my head, same thing.
[32:08.900 --> 32:09.280]  Yeah, yeah.
[32:09.380 --> 32:09.800]  I get that.
[32:10.420 --> 32:13.800]  I'm in my mid-30s, so in my head, same thing.
[32:14.460 --> 32:16.300]  Dua Lipa, also, same thing.
[32:16.400 --> 32:17.580]  Shawn Mendes, Dua Lipa.
[32:17.600 --> 32:18.580]  Yeah, it's all the same thing.
[32:18.860 --> 32:21.280]  We're going to open up some of these One Direction cards.
[32:21.380 --> 32:23.400]  I had saved these for my daughter, but...
[32:23.400 --> 32:23.740]  I don't know.
[32:25.460 --> 32:26.400]  Where is she right now?
[32:27.520 --> 32:29.320]  We'll open two of these and put two in the pack sack.
[32:29.340 --> 32:29.740]  Oh, great.
[32:30.360 --> 32:31.280]  Two of them for later.
[32:31.480 --> 32:31.660]  Nice.
[32:32.100 --> 32:33.700]  Two for flinching.
[32:35.680 --> 32:36.020]  Okay.
[32:36.500 --> 32:37.240]  Which direction did they settle on?
[32:38.760 --> 32:39.980]  I think Harry Styles.
[32:40.340 --> 32:41.660]  The direction they settled on.
[32:41.980 --> 32:45.140]  I think Zayn Malik thought it was his direction, and it truly was not.
[32:45.400 --> 32:45.640]  It was not his direction.
[32:45.920 --> 32:47.360]  It was not the One Direction.
[32:48.320 --> 32:49.760]  I believe we've all said this at some point.
[32:49.900 --> 32:50.660]  I love Harry.
[32:51.400 --> 32:51.980]  There you go.
[32:52.460 --> 32:55.180]  She's back there, nodding and giving a thumbs up.
[32:55.240 --> 32:56.280]  Less people say this.
[32:56.360 --> 32:57.080]  I love Louis.
[32:58.180 --> 32:59.480]  Yeah, Kate gave us one of these.
[32:59.720 --> 33:04.920]  I love Zayn, said a few people.
[33:05.000 --> 33:05.760]  He doesn't look like that.
[33:05.760 --> 33:09.620]  I love Niall, spelled really dumb.
[33:09.840 --> 33:11.040]  How many people are in this band?
[33:11.240 --> 33:11.620]  Five?
[33:12.440 --> 33:14.500]  I don't think I've ever seen that guy before.
[33:14.680 --> 33:17.940]  But I feel like I've seen so many people that look like him, and they're all British.
[33:18.060 --> 33:21.500]  Here's what I assume to be a young One Direction in an old Navy ad.
[33:23.360 --> 33:26.760]  Here's Louis, got shocked by a fork in the light socket.
[33:27.660 --> 33:28.380]  One Direction.
[33:28.720 --> 33:30.060]  His face is so smooth.
[33:30.260 --> 33:31.200]  Up all night.
[33:31.360 --> 33:34.780]  When I was a kid, we would watch a TV show called Up All Night with downtown Julie Brown.
[33:36.880 --> 33:38.560]  And, oh, here's another one.
[33:38.640 --> 33:39.720]  Up all night.
[33:41.020 --> 33:41.280]  Is that Louis?
[33:41.280 --> 33:42.820]  Here's Harry.
[33:43.880 --> 33:44.880]  Classic R.
[33:45.360 --> 33:46.060]  Here's a sticker.
[33:46.320 --> 33:47.280]  Zayn sticker.
[33:47.460 --> 33:47.920]  Wow!
[33:49.180 --> 33:52.340]  Do you think the R is so you can eventually spell out One Direction?
[33:52.420 --> 33:54.420]  I think that's probably the idea.
[33:54.860 --> 33:55.480]  Or for Harry.
[33:55.880 --> 33:57.660]  No, it's got One Direction.
[33:57.780 --> 33:59.620]  We have those in basketball, those.
[33:59.840 --> 34:00.380]  They're called...
[34:02.500 --> 34:04.280]  I don't think I'm going to like this.
[34:04.880 --> 34:06.120]  Well, don't put it on the screen!
[34:08.480 --> 34:09.480]  That's where stickers go.
[34:09.720 --> 34:14.440]  And that way, if you get a bad email, you pop it behind there, and then you can't read it.
[34:17.780 --> 34:20.140]  Here's another fun photo of One Direction.
[34:20.380 --> 34:20.560]  Great.
[34:20.580 --> 34:20.980]  That's good.
[34:22.440 --> 34:25.780]  Oh, this might be the best one yet.
[34:26.280 --> 34:29.440]  Sorry, Dante.
[34:29.940 --> 34:31.660]  Let it be known, he loves that one.
[34:34.280 --> 34:35.300]  And then here's another one.
[34:38.260 --> 34:44.800]  The next time we take photos, I would like me, Gavin, and Andrew to take that photo.
[34:44.880 --> 34:45.380]  That's deserved.
[34:45.860 --> 34:46.240]  Oh, which one?
[34:46.420 --> 34:46.740]  This one.
[34:46.800 --> 34:47.780]  I think that should be our next one.
[34:48.980 --> 34:50.240]  That should be the next fuckface.
[34:50.260 --> 34:51.460]  Like a cricket top?
[34:52.320 --> 34:56.140]  It's kind of a, what's the Tommy Hilfiger kind of a situation, right?
[34:56.960 --> 34:58.200]  We could do that right now.
[34:58.560 --> 34:59.840]  Here's Niall again.
[35:00.220 --> 35:01.340]  I think he's the worst one.
[35:01.920 --> 35:03.520]  That's also not how you spell Niall.
[35:03.520 --> 35:05.060]  Also do some push-ups, buddy.
[35:05.940 --> 35:07.080]  He's like 13.
[35:08.220 --> 35:10.700]  There they are next to the love bug.
[35:13.640 --> 35:16.060]  There's five of them, but there's only four of the individuals.
[35:16.140 --> 35:16.920]  I feel weird having these.
[35:17.240 --> 35:18.160]  There's Louis.
[35:18.960 --> 35:20.940]  Is that one guy missing from a single?
[35:22.060 --> 35:22.980]  We've seen...
[35:22.980 --> 35:24.080]  I feel like I've only seen four of them.
[35:24.080 --> 35:25.580]  Harry, we've seen Louis.
[35:26.080 --> 35:26.200]  Oh!
[35:26.960 --> 35:28.580]  Zane's a little wacky.
[35:29.300 --> 35:29.940]  He's about to quit.
[35:31.540 --> 35:33.060]  Here we are hanging out.
[35:33.060 --> 35:35.200]  Here they are hanging out next to British porta-potties.
[35:36.380 --> 35:41.220]  Zane, Louis, Harry, Niall.
[35:41.480 --> 35:42.280]  But who's the other one?
[35:42.400 --> 35:42.680]  Andy.
[35:46.160 --> 35:46.580]  Bernard.
[35:48.060 --> 35:50.160]  And then Harry again.
[35:50.340 --> 35:50.880]  Everybody loves that one.
[35:51.020 --> 35:52.360]  Oh, it is spelling...
[35:52.360 --> 35:53.380]  I think you were right.
[35:53.580 --> 35:54.540]  It's spelling Harry.
[35:56.080 --> 35:57.200]  Let's make Harry.
[35:57.480 --> 35:58.340]  I love Louis.
[35:58.480 --> 35:58.680]  Let's get Louis together.
[35:58.980 --> 36:00.180]  So we're gonna try to get Harry.
[36:00.540 --> 36:01.920]  So far we got Rhi.
[36:02.500 --> 36:05.460]  You kept it on camera in order for people to see it.
[36:05.500 --> 36:06.080]  We got Uri.
[36:07.040 --> 36:09.440]  So we're working on our Harry completions.
[36:09.580 --> 36:11.720]  We're gonna have to keep opening these until we spell Harry.
[36:11.860 --> 36:13.920]  And then if you could give Kat the I love Louis sticker.
[36:13.960 --> 36:14.500]  Yeah, you got it.
[36:14.560 --> 36:15.620]  Kat, you love Louis, right?
[36:15.800 --> 36:16.320]  That's your...
[36:16.320 --> 36:17.040]  Is that your favorite one?
[36:17.880 --> 36:18.820]  That's your going away present.
[36:18.940 --> 36:20.000]  That sounds like a no.
[36:20.140 --> 36:22.060]  This is your going away present?
[36:22.260 --> 36:23.440]  Thanks for all your hard work.
[36:24.080 --> 36:24.800]  Enjoy that.
[36:26.440 --> 36:27.400]  What should we do now?
[36:27.560 --> 36:28.740]  Do the ones you're excited about.
[36:28.980 --> 36:30.980]  Oh, according to the chat, there's one called Liam.
[36:31.220 --> 36:31.580]  Liam.
[36:31.580 --> 36:32.440]  Oh, Liam.
[36:33.840 --> 36:34.800]  Niall and Liam.
[36:35.300 --> 36:38.980]  You couldn't find two more British guys with that one, huh?
[36:39.100 --> 36:42.920]  Isn't Liam the one who was slinging some up Sheryl Cole at one point?
[36:43.420 --> 36:45.620]  Yeah, someone had a baby with someone famous.
[36:46.640 --> 36:49.220]  Slinging some up Sheryl Cole.
[36:50.180 --> 36:52.000]  Liam, Sheryl Crow. Let's have a look.
[36:52.200 --> 36:52.820]  Sheryl Crow.
[36:53.120 --> 36:53.660]  Sheryl Crow.
[36:54.760 --> 36:56.940]  You know, Sheryl Crow, didn't she date...
[36:56.940 --> 37:00.060]  Did she ever date Kid Rock or were they just in...
[37:00.060 --> 37:01.160]  No, they just had that one song.
[37:02.020 --> 37:03.220]  About their pictures?
[37:03.780 --> 37:04.100]  Two songs.
[37:04.100 --> 37:04.700]  They had two songs.
[37:05.000 --> 37:09.060]  Liam Payne has revealed that Sheryl 33 doesn't...
[37:09.060 --> 37:09.540]  And then I stopped.
[37:09.880 --> 37:12.040]  Wait, it's Russell Crowe's daughter?
[37:12.460 --> 37:13.220]  Wait, who is this?
[37:13.360 --> 37:13.880]  What's happening?
[37:14.040 --> 37:15.160]  Liam is Russell Crowe's daughter?
[37:16.220 --> 37:17.200]  That makes sense.
[37:18.980 --> 37:20.760]  Oh, Louis is pronounced like Louie.
[37:21.100 --> 37:21.960]  Louie. Louie.
[37:22.080 --> 37:22.980]  Oh, right, Louie.
[37:23.260 --> 37:24.040]  But it's spelled like Louis.
[37:24.320 --> 37:26.020]  No, Louis is like with an E-W.
[37:27.460 --> 37:29.700]  Louis Armstrong spelled it like...
[37:29.700 --> 37:32.500]  Louis Medina and our fucking company spells it...
[37:33.100 --> 37:33.980]  That's a different spelling.
[37:34.180 --> 37:34.860]  You're a different spelling.
[37:35.080 --> 37:35.900]  Like W...
[37:38.480 --> 37:40.340]  L-E-W-I-S.
[37:40.520 --> 37:40.900]  I would say it's Louis.
[37:40.940 --> 37:41.720]  It's Louis.
[37:42.220 --> 37:44.300]  L-O-U-I-E-S.
[37:44.580 --> 37:45.800]  It's Louie.
[37:45.840 --> 37:47.800]  Now we're getting into some real cards that might have real value.
[37:48.080 --> 37:49.440]  We're gonna open up some Donruss.
[37:49.720 --> 37:50.340]  NBA Donruss.
[37:50.380 --> 37:52.860]  Oh, he knocked up Sheryl Crowe, apparently.
[37:53.540 --> 37:55.080]  Russell Crowe knocked up Sheryl Crowe.
[37:57.360 --> 37:59.340]  Russell Crowe knocked up Sheryl Crowe?
[38:00.480 --> 38:01.200]  Ha ha.
[38:03.920 --> 38:04.640]  That's insane.
[38:04.840 --> 38:05.860]  How does Buckface break shit?
[38:06.020 --> 38:07.460]  I don't know. I learned a lot about celebrities.
[38:07.980 --> 38:11.900]  I realized I forgot the hits box with all of our hits in my closet.
[38:12.060 --> 38:12.460]  God damn it.
[38:12.460 --> 38:14.020]  I thought maybe this wasn't enough stuff.
[38:14.280 --> 38:15.360]  You're gonna go home with this.
[38:15.360 --> 38:15.920]  Here we go.
[38:16.060 --> 38:17.120]  Alexey Pokachevsky.
[38:17.420 --> 38:19.700]  Everybody in the NBA has trouble saying his name, but it's pretty simple.
[38:19.980 --> 38:20.340]  Pokachevsky.
[38:21.500 --> 38:23.000]  So, how much was this box?
[38:23.160 --> 38:23.900]  Is it like an expensive box?
[38:24.060 --> 38:24.420]  $25.
[38:24.840 --> 38:25.360]  Oh, that's not great.
[38:25.380 --> 38:26.160]  It's not too expensive.
[38:26.760 --> 38:27.860]  Here's MPJ Jr.
[38:28.400 --> 38:30.520]  He is very good, but always hurt. Very hurt.
[38:30.680 --> 38:31.840]  The man's made of glass.
[38:32.000 --> 38:33.600]  That baby is called Bearpain?
[38:34.040 --> 38:34.720]  Nuh-uh.
[38:35.820 --> 38:36.260]  Bearpain.
[38:36.340 --> 38:38.560]  Kat is nodding yes. She knows all about Bearpain.
[38:39.060 --> 38:39.500]  Bearpain.
[38:39.960 --> 38:40.300]  How?
[38:40.560 --> 38:42.520]  That's an amazing name.
[38:42.540 --> 38:45.600]  It's a real pilot inspector situation where it's just like, what happened here?
[38:46.620 --> 38:47.540]  I had a dog named Bear.
[38:47.820 --> 38:48.420]  Here's Kripstap.
[38:49.460 --> 38:50.340]  Kripstap's Porzingis.
[38:52.720 --> 38:54.760]  He's a place for the Washington Wizards now. He got traded.
[38:54.880 --> 38:57.260]  They brought him over to Paramount with Luka Doncic.
[38:57.260 --> 39:00.140]  Luka Doncic was like, one euro is enough for this team.
[39:00.220 --> 39:01.280]  Get him the fuck out of here.
[39:02.620 --> 39:03.260]  Kripstap's Porzingis.
[39:03.560 --> 39:04.560]  I feel like that's a good name.
[39:04.720 --> 39:05.260]  It's a good name.
[39:05.880 --> 39:06.820]  Oh, did you want to pull it over?
[39:06.980 --> 39:08.580]  Yeah, I feel like that's worth keeping.
[39:08.700 --> 39:09.760]  I feel like he's incredibly well-known.
[39:09.840 --> 39:11.560]  What's good? The first or the last name?
[39:12.580 --> 39:13.860]  Do you like Kripstap or Porzingis?
[39:14.740 --> 39:15.060]  Porzingis.
[39:15.220 --> 39:17.680]  I think Porzingis is a very good one.
[39:17.760 --> 39:18.320]  It's a clutch.
[39:19.020 --> 39:23.280]  If you like Butterclutch and Kripstap's Porzingis, you're gonna love...
[39:23.280 --> 39:23.880]  You mean Gorman?
[39:24.240 --> 39:24.420]  Yeah.
[39:24.500 --> 39:25.720]  You're gonna love...
[39:26.640 --> 39:27.580]  This is a good one.
[39:27.620 --> 39:28.260]  Bojan Bogdanovic.
[39:28.660 --> 39:29.660]  Oh yeah, Bogdanovic.
[39:29.800 --> 39:32.460]  Who I think might be listed as a good name in our thing.
[39:32.840 --> 39:33.080]  Probably.
[39:33.740 --> 39:34.920]  I can't remember if it's Boban or Bojan.
[39:35.820 --> 39:36.540]  Mike Conley.
[39:37.360 --> 39:38.900]  Still playing for the Jazz, I believe.
[39:41.660 --> 39:42.380]  Will Barton.
[39:42.720 --> 39:44.720]  The cut is of Fartin' Barton.
[39:44.820 --> 39:45.760]  I assume they call him in school.
[39:45.760 --> 39:46.940]  Is that why he's posed like that?
[39:46.980 --> 39:47.200]  Yeah.
[39:47.380 --> 39:48.260]  He's about to let it rip.
[39:49.300 --> 39:51.260]  That's where his name...
[39:51.260 --> 39:52.680]  The photo is the same as his nickname.
[39:53.040 --> 39:53.380]  Nice.
[39:53.500 --> 39:53.980]  That I gave him.
[39:54.940 --> 39:55.740]  Chris Duarte.
[39:56.100 --> 39:56.500]  Rookie.
[39:56.880 --> 39:57.480]  Save that.
[39:58.560 --> 39:59.240]  And then...
[39:59.240 --> 40:00.000]  Great.
[40:00.840 --> 40:01.640]  Kyrie Irving.
[40:01.920 --> 40:02.820]  Fuckin' insert card.
[40:02.900 --> 40:03.840]  Everybody loves Kyrie Irving.
[40:03.860 --> 40:04.940]  Can't he play in New York again?
[40:05.380 --> 40:05.620]  No.
[40:06.020 --> 40:06.420]  Yes.
[40:06.720 --> 40:07.160]  No, he can.
[40:07.300 --> 40:08.300]  I thought they just passed that.
[40:08.660 --> 40:09.660]  He can, but the...
[40:09.660 --> 40:13.000]  If you're rich enough, you can play sports in the state of New York.
[40:13.100 --> 40:13.580]  Yeah, apparently.
[40:13.580 --> 40:14.320]  Without being vaccinated, I think.
[40:14.800 --> 40:15.200]  Apparently.
[40:15.480 --> 40:15.800]  That's cool.
[40:16.380 --> 40:17.260]  That's pretty cool.
[40:17.420 --> 40:18.460]  Just in time for the playoffs.
[40:18.660 --> 40:21.020]  Suddenly they managed to put it together.
[40:21.180 --> 40:22.540]  Really weird with baseball starting.
[40:22.760 --> 40:23.800]  It was...
[40:23.800 --> 40:27.180]  It was looking like maybe that...
[40:27.180 --> 40:28.480]  Maybe that they wouldn't...
[40:28.480 --> 40:30.020]  The Nets wouldn't make it into the play-in.
[40:30.160 --> 40:31.700]  And then all of a sudden, Kyrie Irving can play.
[40:31.820 --> 40:32.360]  That's so nuts.
[40:32.440 --> 40:33.020]  Yeah, crazy, huh?
[40:33.020 --> 40:33.840]  That's really crazy.
[40:35.000 --> 40:40.580]  One of my favorite sports conspiracy narratives is that they were holding Kyrie back because the mayor of New York is a Knicks fan.
[40:41.160 --> 40:42.500]  Like, he was just purely...
[40:42.500 --> 40:43.640]  That was, like, the only thing.
[40:43.740 --> 40:44.840]  He was just trying to hold them back.
[40:44.920 --> 40:46.020]  Not looking good for the Lakers, huh?
[40:46.240 --> 40:47.420]  No, dead in the cell.
[40:47.520 --> 40:47.940]  Oh, they're terrible.
[40:49.180 --> 40:51.300]  Speaking of the Lakers, there's Russell Westbrook.
[40:51.460 --> 40:51.780]  Don't.
[40:51.780 --> 40:52.380]  What is that?
[40:52.380 --> 40:53.180]  That's sad.
[40:53.660 --> 40:55.500]  Does not like it when you call him his new nickname.
[40:55.800 --> 40:56.180]  What is it?
[40:56.180 --> 40:57.160]  Oh, Brick?
[40:57.520 --> 40:57.840]  Westbrook.
[40:58.040 --> 40:58.260]  Yeah.
[40:58.820 --> 41:02.160]  I will say, though, the other night, he had a triple-double and he scored the game-winning...
[41:02.160 --> 41:02.780]  He did.
[41:02.860 --> 41:03.220]  He did.
[41:03.360 --> 41:03.960]  It was...
[41:03.960 --> 41:04.500]  It was beautiful.
[41:04.500 --> 41:06.880]  It was a real thing where you went, where's this been?
[41:07.040 --> 41:07.220]  Yeah.
[41:07.220 --> 41:08.400]  And he goes, I don't know.
[41:08.660 --> 41:09.040]  It was good.
[41:09.100 --> 41:10.660]  And then everyone goes, all right.
[41:10.820 --> 41:11.420]  It was good to see you again.
[41:11.600 --> 41:14.480]  The man averaged a triple-double three years in a row.
[41:14.500 --> 41:14.860]  Right, right, right.
[41:14.920 --> 41:16.120]  Nobody will ever do that again.
[41:16.240 --> 41:16.840]  How's it going this year?
[41:17.060 --> 41:17.600]  Not as good.
[41:17.660 --> 41:17.920]  Oh, weird.
[41:18.180 --> 41:18.820]  Brandon Ingram.
[41:18.940 --> 41:20.580]  Yeah, that last one was a pretty good...
[41:20.580 --> 41:22.640]  Sort of two inches from blowjob, sort of.
[41:22.640 --> 41:23.360]  Oh, yeah.
[41:23.980 --> 41:24.740]  Dick to face?
[41:24.800 --> 41:25.440]  Ready to receive.
[41:25.740 --> 41:26.500]  Dick to face ratio is good.
[41:26.840 --> 41:27.660]  It's high dick to face.
[41:27.800 --> 41:28.000]  I like it.
[41:28.080 --> 41:31.820]  I was going to say, the look of fear on the guy's face in Westbrook shooting is the last
[41:31.820 --> 41:33.000]  time anyone's ever done that.
[41:33.100 --> 41:34.180]  That was like the last photo.
[41:34.380 --> 41:34.480]  Yeah.
[41:34.980 --> 41:35.960]  Here's Brandon Ingram.
[41:36.200 --> 41:37.040]  Used to be a Laker.
[41:37.300 --> 41:40.200]  Probably would help the Lakers out a lot, but they mortgaged their future to get Anthony
[41:40.200 --> 41:41.380]  Davis, who's made of glass.
[41:41.540 --> 41:41.640]  Yeah.
[41:42.520 --> 41:43.180]  Jalen Brown.
[41:43.500 --> 41:45.820]  Andrew Wiggins looks like he was teleported into that game.
[41:46.160 --> 41:47.280]  Like he's not supposed to...
[41:47.280 --> 41:47.440]  Wait.
[41:47.440 --> 41:48.340]  Go back to the card for a second.
[41:48.420 --> 41:49.620]  Look at Andrew Wiggins.
[41:49.620 --> 41:50.440]  Oh, in the background?
[41:51.360 --> 41:51.660]  Yeah.
[41:52.280 --> 41:52.600]  Where am I?
[41:52.600 --> 41:52.940]  What the?
[41:53.280 --> 41:54.260]  I was in my living room.
[41:54.580 --> 41:55.180]  We'll save that.
[41:55.320 --> 41:56.800]  That's an awesome teleport card.
[41:57.460 --> 41:59.600]  Jalen Brown, we'll save because we save all Celtics.
[41:59.900 --> 42:00.840]  Having a great season.
[42:00.980 --> 42:02.540]  We got robbed in the fucking playoffs.
[42:03.980 --> 42:05.660]  Kelly Olynyk, we've talked about him before.
[42:06.220 --> 42:07.400]  His nickname's MapleDick.
[42:08.540 --> 42:09.800]  He's seven feet tall and Canadian.
[42:10.820 --> 42:11.560]  We've mentioned it.
[42:11.720 --> 42:13.220]  Speaking of Kyrie Irving, there he is again.
[42:13.480 --> 42:13.520]  Cool.
[42:14.400 --> 42:15.940]  Somebody's taking a fucking video of him.
[42:16.180 --> 42:17.240]  He's like, wait, we've got to capture this.
[42:17.260 --> 42:18.180]  He's actually playing for one.
[42:19.080 --> 42:19.540]  He's away.
[42:19.540 --> 42:25.620]  Speaking of somebody who's not playing, Kawhi Leonard, still no news on when that man's
[42:25.620 --> 42:26.260]  coming back to basketball.
[42:26.280 --> 42:26.420]  Nope.
[42:26.440 --> 42:26.960]  What happened?
[42:27.500 --> 42:28.120]  He got injured.
[42:28.460 --> 42:28.640]  Appalena.
[42:29.160 --> 42:31.060]  Look at how muscly his arms are, though.
[42:31.260 --> 42:32.020]  Yeah, well, he's not putting those muscles...
[42:32.020 --> 42:33.100]  He's got Jesus muscles.
[42:33.360 --> 42:34.460]  He does have Jesus muscles.
[42:34.560 --> 42:36.540]  He's a big dude.
[42:36.700 --> 42:37.620]  He's got crazy hands.
[42:37.700 --> 42:38.020]  I call him the get-off.
[42:38.020 --> 42:39.140]  Is Jesus beefy like that?
[42:39.320 --> 42:41.040]  I feel like on the cross, Jesus is ripped.
[42:41.640 --> 42:44.600]  He's ripped because he's starving to death.
[42:44.600 --> 42:51.860]  You see the other guys, and they have a lot of muscle, but they're not as cut, you know?
[42:53.360 --> 42:55.300]  That one might be lowest body fat.
[42:55.620 --> 42:56.840]  I guess they all are.
[42:56.880 --> 42:58.800]  She's going through all the cards and going, all these guys are shredded.
[42:58.800 --> 42:59.300]  I guess they are.
[42:59.380 --> 42:59.720]  Never mind.
[42:59.960 --> 43:01.840]  All these professional athletes are fucking shat.
[43:01.840 --> 43:03.020]  They're all up there with Jesus.
[43:03.380 --> 43:03.740]  Interesting.
[43:04.220 --> 43:05.620]  Denny Aveda.
[43:05.660 --> 43:06.980]  Oh, this is...
[43:06.980 --> 43:07.120]  What?
[43:07.540 --> 43:11.500]  Okay, if we're talking about a teleport card, it looks like he's getting out of there.
[43:11.700 --> 43:13.180]  It's like he teleported off.
[43:15.520 --> 43:19.320]  I'm assuming that's what it looked like in Twin Peaks before the person turned into a doorknob.
[43:19.460 --> 43:25.380]  That wasn't the soundboard, that was Geoff.
[43:25.540 --> 43:26.040]  That was just me.
[43:26.580 --> 43:27.680]  Got a bunch more of these to open.
[43:27.720 --> 43:28.440]  Oh, we should put one of them in.
[43:28.580 --> 43:29.780]  Are we not on YouTube right now?
[43:30.580 --> 43:33.120]  I don't think we've ever been on YouTube for this.
[43:33.940 --> 43:39.800]  It was like, I did the garage sale thing, and it was a whole thing to get it on YouTube.
[43:40.100 --> 43:41.730]  We had to keep cajoling.
[43:42.200 --> 43:43.780]  You started the company, you should just say...
[43:43.780 --> 43:44.820]  Oh, that was him, I'm sorry.
[43:45.060 --> 43:47.340]  You started the company, you should just say, hey, we should do this.
[43:47.480 --> 43:48.480]  Hey, we should do this on YouTube.
[43:48.660 --> 43:48.860]  Okay.
[43:48.960 --> 43:51.940]  Where is your thingy video that you did recently?
[43:52.700 --> 43:53.340]  Your sale.
[43:53.680 --> 43:54.500]  The go-go now?
[43:54.680 --> 43:54.880]  Yeah.
[43:57.020 --> 44:01.160]  It was me selling shit that I can't buy now.
[44:01.500 --> 44:02.540]  Well, that's all right, but where's the video?
[44:02.680 --> 44:03.900]  It's on the side, I think.
[44:04.380 --> 44:05.260]  Did you want to watch it?
[44:05.320 --> 44:06.880]  Yeah, but what do I type?
[44:07.720 --> 44:08.340]  What is it?
[44:08.960 --> 44:09.920]  What tab would it be under?
[44:10.860 --> 44:12.320]  So if you start clicking around...
[44:14.300 --> 44:15.620]  We're not bashing the site.
[44:16.780 --> 44:17.420]  PJ Tucker.
[44:18.880 --> 44:20.380]  He used to play for a lot of people.
[44:20.520 --> 44:20.840]  He's cool.
[44:21.020 --> 44:23.880]  He's got the best shoe game in the NBA, PJ Tucker.
[44:24.460 --> 44:26.220]  Mike's throwing up the horns every time we got a little more.
[44:27.860 --> 44:28.500]  Desmond Bain.
[44:28.760 --> 44:34.620]  Speaking of jacked fucking dudes, you may not be able to see it in this, but Desmond Bain has got fucking guns.
[44:34.920 --> 44:35.680]  That dude is solid.
[44:35.960 --> 44:36.900]  Turned out to be a very good player.
[44:36.900 --> 44:37.760]  Ooh, I like this zoom.
[44:37.880 --> 44:38.660]  Look at us go.
[44:39.300 --> 44:40.320]  Yeah, more close-ups.
[44:41.120 --> 44:41.760]  So jacked.
[44:41.760 --> 44:51.520]  Here we have Peyton Pritchard for the Boston Celtics, or as they call him, P-Rabbit, or Fast P, or 8 Mile, they also call him.
[44:51.560 --> 44:52.780]  Those are all bad names.
[44:53.080 --> 44:54.720]  Well, yeah, they're making an M&M reference.
[44:55.220 --> 44:56.920]  Yeah, no, I got it.
[44:57.080 --> 44:58.860]  I didn't say they were good, I'm just saying that's what they call them.
[44:59.100 --> 44:59.880]  Here's Steven Adams.
[45:00.860 --> 45:01.920]  He is a big dude.
[45:03.080 --> 45:03.740]  Real big dude.
[45:04.800 --> 45:05.580]  Obi Toppin.
[45:06.300 --> 45:07.260]  New York Knick.
[45:07.640 --> 45:07.900]  Ooh.
[45:08.100 --> 45:08.600]  Great name.
[45:08.600 --> 45:10.380]  Obi Toppin is a good name.
[45:11.600 --> 45:12.740]  Here's Anthony Edwards.
[45:13.240 --> 45:16.740]  One of the most colorful characters in the NBA.
[45:17.060 --> 45:18.680]  He's going to be entertaining for many...
[45:18.680 --> 45:20.120]  He's very talented, but also very funny.
[45:20.620 --> 45:21.140]  And wacky.
[45:21.560 --> 45:22.760]  Io DeSalmo rookie.
[45:23.920 --> 45:27.680]  If Anthony Edwards was part of a game called, has this man shot a basketball before?
[45:27.820 --> 45:28.520]  I would guess no.
[45:28.840 --> 45:29.900]  It was just his face.
[45:30.040 --> 45:31.360]  If you could just see the ball in the face.
[45:31.980 --> 45:34.000]  It looks like he's going...
[45:35.340 --> 45:38.440]  And then we have another orange reactive.
[45:38.560 --> 45:39.880]  This is a Siddiq Bay rookie, I believe.
[45:40.080 --> 45:40.940]  So there's a reactive?
[45:41.240 --> 45:41.900]  That's the type of parallel?
[45:41.900 --> 45:43.840]  I don't know if it's called a reactive.
[45:44.040 --> 45:44.580]  I don't know what it is.
[45:44.660 --> 45:45.460]  Orange laser parallel?
[45:45.900 --> 45:48.460]  Actually, it'll say...
[45:50.720 --> 45:51.660]  Who's that in the background?
[45:51.780 --> 45:52.120]  42.
[45:52.560 --> 45:53.660]  What is he blocking?
[45:54.700 --> 45:55.780]  Why is he doing that?
[45:57.600 --> 45:59.120]  Who is he defending back there?
[45:59.140 --> 46:01.200]  That's Maxi Kleber in the background.
[46:02.840 --> 46:05.680]  These are looking for...
[46:05.680 --> 46:08.180]  It should say somewhere what's in it, right?
[46:08.920 --> 46:09.200]  I don't know.
[46:09.660 --> 46:10.840]  Orange laser is what it's called.
[46:11.300 --> 46:11.940]  Orange laser.
[46:12.060 --> 46:12.440]  There you go.
[46:13.300 --> 46:15.120]  If only we had a laser sound on the soundboard.
[46:16.220 --> 46:17.080]  Okay, we got this one?
[46:19.000 --> 46:20.900]  You should do that every time...
[46:20.900 --> 46:24.200]  Every time we get one of those orange laser cards, you should pop that.
[46:24.900 --> 46:25.160]  Okay.
[46:27.760 --> 46:28.840]  Don't let me tell you how to do that.
[46:28.840 --> 46:29.820]  Jake Crowder.
[46:31.020 --> 46:32.400]  Used to play for the Celtics. Loved him.
[46:32.520 --> 46:33.080]  Bad attitude.
[46:33.460 --> 46:34.420]  Doing really well for Phoenix.
[46:35.320 --> 46:36.580]  Here's the best hair in the NBA.
[46:36.720 --> 46:37.220]  Trae Young.
[46:37.520 --> 46:37.820]  Nice.
[46:38.680 --> 46:39.680]  Gary Trent Jr.
[46:40.280 --> 46:41.560]  His dad was Gary Trent.
[46:42.920 --> 46:43.760]  Terrence Ross.
[46:43.920 --> 46:44.900]  His dad was Rick Ross.
[46:45.100 --> 46:46.020]  I don't think that's...
[46:46.020 --> 46:47.080]  Jamal Murray.
[46:47.540 --> 46:50.440]  No longer plays basketball because he's hurt, but he makes a lot of good...
[46:50.440 --> 46:51.080]  Who's his dad?
[46:52.240 --> 46:52.860]  Jamal Murray.
[46:53.900 --> 46:54.620]  Eddie Murray.
[46:55.100 --> 46:55.480]  Oh, yeah?
[46:55.640 --> 46:55.880]  Yeah.
[46:56.060 --> 46:57.320]  His dad's Eddie Murray, a baseball player.
[46:57.780 --> 46:58.500]  Chris Paul.
[46:59.000 --> 46:59.400]  CP3.
[46:59.680 --> 47:00.600]  The pride of New Orleans.
[47:01.060 --> 47:03.440]  He's not from there or anything, but he got drafted there.
[47:04.340 --> 47:05.600]  I felt nothing about that.
[47:05.660 --> 47:06.560]  I just thought...
[47:06.560 --> 47:07.140]  I don't know Chris Paul.
[47:07.660 --> 47:08.480]  I do like him, but...
[47:08.480 --> 47:09.260]  They call him the point god.
[47:09.840 --> 47:10.940]  I like him in state farm commercials.
[47:11.320 --> 47:12.780]  He is good in state farm commercials.
[47:12.780 --> 47:13.540]  I love it in state farm commercials.
[47:14.060 --> 47:15.080]  Jalen Johnson rookie.
[47:16.140 --> 47:17.980]  That's an old school basketball stance.
[47:18.260 --> 47:23.320]  That looks like an old timey throwback to the black and white footage where the guys are like...
[47:24.360 --> 47:26.440]  Everyone's doing the fundamentals, but wrong.
[47:27.100 --> 47:28.240]  That's what that looks like.
[47:28.440 --> 47:31.140]  And then we have DeJounte Murray.
[47:32.180 --> 47:33.700]  Donnerous franchise futures.
[47:33.800 --> 47:34.700]  What a lame parallel.
[47:34.900 --> 47:39.340]  It sounded like you were saying a lot of words that you were learning for the first time.
[47:39.720 --> 47:40.280]  Did it?
[47:42.060 --> 47:43.920]  My mouth isn't working as good as it used to.
[47:44.060 --> 47:44.920]  I've been noticing that lately.
[47:45.020 --> 47:45.560]  All the teeth?
[47:46.540 --> 47:47.200]  Maybe, I don't know.
[47:47.400 --> 47:48.820]  My brain's...
[47:48.820 --> 47:49.780]  I'm getting soft.
[47:50.300 --> 47:51.640]  I'm getting head soft, I think.
[47:51.720 --> 47:52.340]  Getting soft?
[47:53.100 --> 47:53.500]  Yeah.
[47:54.900 --> 47:55.700]  Cam Johnson.
[47:57.360 --> 47:58.080]  Here's Joker.
[47:58.140 --> 47:58.860]  Wait, wait, wait.
[47:58.980 --> 47:59.360]  Go back.
[47:59.600 --> 48:00.240]  What a face.
[48:01.540 --> 48:02.860]  He's got that face.
[48:03.200 --> 48:03.760]  All the time.
[48:03.960 --> 48:04.320]  Oh, bummer.
[48:04.520 --> 48:06.420]  Yeah, his face is always kind of like that.
[48:06.480 --> 48:06.840]  Sorry, Cam.
[48:07.320 --> 48:08.480]  Yeah, it's a rough life.
[48:09.160 --> 48:09.940]  This is funny.
[48:10.120 --> 48:11.340]  Nikola Jokic, the reigning MVP.
[48:11.860 --> 48:13.080]  The Joker, as they call him.
[48:13.120 --> 48:14.640]  I was watching a Celtics game the other day.
[48:14.840 --> 48:16.460]  Celtics beat the Nuggets.
[48:16.560 --> 48:17.360]  Beat the shit out of them.
[48:17.560 --> 48:19.060]  Beat the utter shit out of them.
[48:19.060 --> 48:26.340]  And Grant Williams stopped Jokic so well that he declared after the game that his new nickname is Batman.
[48:26.740 --> 48:27.760]  That's awesome!
[48:28.100 --> 48:32.020]  And everybody on the Celtics refuses to call him Batman, but they talk about it constantly.
[48:32.180 --> 48:32.880]  That's so cool.
[48:33.240 --> 48:34.780]  Even the announcers talk about it.
[48:35.200 --> 48:36.900]  It's really funny, and it's really sticking, too.
[48:37.220 --> 48:39.240]  And now, Peyton Pritchard wants to be called Robin.
[48:40.140 --> 48:41.000]  So they're Batman and Robin.
[48:41.240 --> 48:42.220]  How adorable is that?
[48:42.220 --> 48:42.740]  I love that.
[48:42.760 --> 48:43.420]  Jaron Jackson Jr.
[48:43.560 --> 48:43.880]  I'm Robin.
[48:43.880 --> 48:44.660]  Or Jaron Jackson Jr.
[48:46.180 --> 48:47.940]  He's like, I don't want the 8 Mile anymore.
[48:47.940 --> 48:50.120]  Robin always gets the wrong...
[48:50.580 --> 48:52.060]  Stop calling me 8 Mile!
[48:52.440 --> 48:55.040]  Not a lot of longevity in the Robin career.
[48:55.200 --> 48:57.060]  Usually the dead are really disenfranchised.
[48:57.080 --> 48:59.120]  You think that's probably what's going to happen to him?
[48:59.620 --> 48:59.980]  Chris Boucher.
[49:00.320 --> 49:00.460]  Yeah.
[49:01.020 --> 49:01.420]  Boucher?
[49:01.660 --> 49:04.460]  Well, he's saying his name as he's going up.
[49:05.160 --> 49:05.560]  Boucher!
[49:05.820 --> 49:07.260]  Oh, that's where your name is the thing you're doing.
[49:07.440 --> 49:08.020]  We did that earlier.
[49:08.240 --> 49:08.640]  Yeah, there we go.
[49:08.980 --> 49:09.660]  He's verbing.
[49:10.140 --> 49:10.880]  He's verbing.
[49:11.040 --> 49:11.880]  That's what it's called, verbing.
[49:12.140 --> 49:12.800]  I love it.
[49:14.180 --> 49:15.060]  Oh, here's Donovan Mitchell.
[49:15.360 --> 49:16.160]  He's got a good nickname.
[49:16.160 --> 49:18.040]  Can you guess what his nickname is from that?
[49:18.540 --> 49:19.480]  Do you know what his nickname is?
[49:19.480 --> 49:19.820]  Mitchell Pickle?
[49:20.820 --> 49:21.400]  Fade away.
[49:22.060 --> 49:23.720]  Mitchell Pickle would be a good one, but that's not it.
[49:24.180 --> 49:25.120]  Where'd you get Pickle from?
[49:27.700 --> 49:28.820]  His nickname is Spider.
[49:30.240 --> 49:30.600]  Why?
[49:31.060 --> 49:31.380]  I don't know.
[49:31.560 --> 49:34.160]  Because he probably picked it himself and he's like, I'm Spider.
[49:34.760 --> 49:35.420]  I'm like Spider.
[49:36.660 --> 49:39.620]  He had a substitute teacher and he went, they call me Spider.
[49:40.000 --> 49:40.560]  Ty Jerome.
[49:41.220 --> 49:42.680]  Oh, big opportunity coming up for you here.
[49:42.740 --> 49:42.900]  Me?
[49:43.180 --> 49:43.560]  Okay, ready.
[49:44.040 --> 49:46.920]  Matisse thigh bull, great defender, plays for the wrong team though.
[49:48.360 --> 49:49.220]  And then here.
[49:49.860 --> 49:50.200]  Nice.
[49:53.600 --> 49:54.560]  That was pretty cool.
[49:54.780 --> 49:55.460]  That was pretty good.
[49:59.720 --> 50:00.380]  That's awesome.
[50:00.580 --> 50:02.680]  I like that you let up with all the small ones and then hit it.
[50:02.880 --> 50:03.360]  That was pretty cool.
[50:03.380 --> 50:03.840]  We'll leave Beasley.
[50:04.720 --> 50:05.720]  I need to get a look at it.
[50:05.780 --> 50:08.580]  Any time I get an orange laser, it's fucking useless.
[50:09.440 --> 50:10.420]  I was having too much fun.
[50:10.420 --> 50:11.120]  I was doing something.
[50:12.620 --> 50:13.400]  You all right, Emily?
[50:13.680 --> 50:17.200]  I was looking to see if you had anything that was like an expensive box.
[50:17.780 --> 50:18.180]  You know?
[50:18.400 --> 50:21.380]  Yeah, I mean, I got some optic back here.
[50:22.460 --> 50:23.520]  But they have...
[50:23.520 --> 50:25.580]  I bought the wrong stuff.
[50:25.680 --> 50:26.500]  We can open that up later.
[50:27.160 --> 50:29.840]  Tyrese Halliburton got traded to the fucking Indiana Pacers.
[50:30.040 --> 50:30.640]  Sucks for him.
[50:31.280 --> 50:32.220]  Joel Embiid.
[50:33.900 --> 50:34.780]  Tristan Thompson.
[50:35.580 --> 50:36.320]  Tristan Thompson.
[50:36.640 --> 50:38.080]  Now that's a penis that gets around.
[50:38.400 --> 50:39.300]  Boo-hoo.
[50:41.300 --> 50:45.240]  Emily is a Kardashian stan, so she's anti-Tristan Thompson.
[50:45.260 --> 50:45.780]  Leave her alone.
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.120]  He's got a new baby in Texas somewhere.
[50:49.120 --> 50:50.060]  Where's Lamar Odom?
[50:51.280 --> 50:53.300]  He's on Celebrity Big Brother.
[50:53.460 --> 50:54.000]  Boo-hoo.
[50:55.360 --> 50:59.140]  The entire time he was on Celebrity Big Brother, he was talking about how he wants to get Khloe back.
[50:59.800 --> 51:01.780]  That's not gonna happen.
[51:01.920 --> 51:02.440]  Jared Allen.
[51:02.820 --> 51:03.340]  Love him.
[51:03.640 --> 51:04.240]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[51:04.360 --> 51:06.540]  He's aware of our existence.
[51:07.340 --> 51:08.220]  Patrick Beverly.
[51:09.240 --> 51:12.040]  Patrick Beverly is one of those guys that if he plays for your team, you probably love him.
[51:12.120 --> 51:12.400]  Trash.
[51:12.960 --> 51:13.560]  He's trash.
[51:13.900 --> 51:14.660]  Did you see that the other night?
[51:14.780 --> 51:16.020]  When he was, oh, that was so awesome.
[51:16.900 --> 51:18.040]  Is he the one that said, you stink?
[51:18.140 --> 51:20.300]  Yeah, he was, oh my God, that was so cool.
[51:20.600 --> 51:23.000]  He did, he went like this to Russell Westbrook and said, you're trash.
[51:23.340 --> 51:26.620]  I love Pat Bev for how much he just talks.
[51:26.620 --> 51:28.580]  He's a big, he's one of the biggest shit-talkers.
[51:29.040 --> 51:30.000]  There's Luke Kennard.
[51:30.400 --> 51:32.820]  We said he had a bad tan, I believe, in one episode.
[51:33.820 --> 51:35.100]  Does he not shave his armpits?
[51:35.640 --> 51:36.160]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[51:36.160 --> 51:38.740]  He seems like the kind of guy who definitely would shave his armpits.
[51:38.780 --> 51:39.720]  No, no, no, but look.
[51:39.760 --> 51:40.840]  I noticed that they all shaved their armpits.
[51:40.920 --> 51:42.000]  That doesn't look shaved.
[51:42.260 --> 51:42.640]  Oh, yeah.
[51:42.880 --> 51:43.420]  I thought you said shaved their arms.
[51:43.420 --> 51:43.800]  Not at all.
[51:43.920 --> 51:44.080]  Yeah.
[51:44.440 --> 51:45.200]  No, he's got some armpits.
[51:45.320 --> 51:46.560]  Why would...
[51:46.560 --> 51:48.360]  Do they all shave their armpits?
[51:48.400 --> 51:49.140]  I've never noticed it.
[51:49.140 --> 51:51.540]  I feel like, I feel like you see a lot of shaved armpits.
[51:51.640 --> 51:52.340]  I never thought about it.
[51:52.360 --> 51:53.480]  I've never noticed it.
[51:53.520 --> 51:56.480]  We haven't noticed any arm hair in any of these guys, and there's a lot of dudes going up.
[51:56.640 --> 51:57.340]  Well, here's an opportunity.
[51:57.540 --> 51:57.720]  Yeah.
[51:57.800 --> 51:58.660]  Here's Malachi Flynn.
[51:58.880 --> 51:59.280]  How's that?
[52:00.100 --> 52:00.600]  Oh, oh.
[52:01.540 --> 52:02.360]  Wrong one, wrong one.
[52:02.360 --> 52:05.980]  That owl just got shot with a laser.
[52:07.700 --> 52:12.640]  It's like an attack on a bomb.
[52:12.820 --> 52:13.860]  That is so fun.
[52:14.080 --> 52:14.800]  Yeah, it's great.
[52:15.060 --> 52:15.720]  Malachi Flynn.
[52:16.400 --> 52:17.020]  He, uh, yeah.
[52:17.160 --> 52:17.740]  Plays for the Raptors.
[52:18.060 --> 52:19.100]  If he's even in the NBA still.
[52:19.820 --> 52:20.520]  I don't know that he is.
[52:22.300 --> 52:24.760]  Just four more packs here of this, then we'll move on to something else.
[52:26.500 --> 52:27.040]  Ooh, yeah.
[52:27.140 --> 52:27.800]  Yeah, we'll open it.
[52:27.820 --> 52:30.080]  We'll finally crack the official Hollywood trading cards.
[52:30.700 --> 52:32.120]  We just saw that and went, ooh.
[52:32.120 --> 52:33.560]  Which stars do you hope to see?
[52:34.560 --> 52:36.280]  I hope to pull an Elizabeth Taylor.
[52:37.060 --> 52:38.040]  Ooh, there you go.
[52:38.040 --> 52:39.140]  This is a good one.
[52:39.180 --> 52:39.840]  Steph Curry.
[52:40.080 --> 52:40.820]  Never heard of him.
[52:40.960 --> 52:43.140]  Oh, that's, uh, that's Seth Curry's brother.
[52:43.380 --> 52:43.540]  Yeah.
[52:44.360 --> 52:45.260]  Uh, Andrew Wiggins.
[52:45.880 --> 52:47.360]  He got teleported into another card.
[52:47.520 --> 52:51.220]  I'm sorry, did you pull a, a Seth Curry card and say it was Seth Curry's brother?
[52:51.340 --> 52:52.240]  Yeah, he's Seth Curry's brother.
[52:52.420 --> 52:54.360]  Is that how he's, is that how he's known?
[52:54.660 --> 52:55.560]  On this show, yes.
[52:56.780 --> 52:57.600]  Seth Curry's brother.
[52:57.740 --> 53:00.460]  You might be the first person to ever say that other than his parents.
[53:00.580 --> 53:01.040]  Yeah, probably.
[53:01.040 --> 53:02.720]  I don't even think his parents say it.
[53:02.900 --> 53:04.080]  R.J. Barrett.
[53:04.640 --> 53:05.460]  That's pretty good.
[53:06.120 --> 53:07.400]  Uh, Keldon Johnson.
[53:08.680 --> 53:09.840]  Uh, DeAndre Ayton.
[53:10.080 --> 53:10.940]  Doesn't get enough respect.
[53:11.060 --> 53:11.620]  That man's good.
[53:11.760 --> 53:12.920]  God, I love those sons' jerseys.
[53:13.020 --> 53:14.120]  Fucking, they are awesome.
[53:14.520 --> 53:15.460]  Jay Sean Tate.
[53:16.260 --> 53:17.100]  That's a smooth pick.
[53:17.420 --> 53:18.120]  Love Jay Sean Tate.
[53:18.120 --> 53:18.660]  That's what I'm saying.
[53:19.740 --> 53:20.700]  Smooth pick, Jay Sean Tate?
[53:20.900 --> 53:21.680]  Smooth pits.
[53:21.920 --> 53:22.300]  Smooth pits.
[53:22.320 --> 53:23.160]  Now I'm looking for armpits.
[53:23.540 --> 53:25.900]  Yeah, I'm saying, like, that's, like, yeah, they're pretty smooth.
[53:25.900 --> 53:26.640]  What did Jesus have?
[53:26.760 --> 53:27.500]  Did he have to parry?
[53:27.740 --> 53:28.320]  I don't know.
[53:28.380 --> 53:29.500]  I've only seen him on a cross.
[53:30.340 --> 53:32.140]  Right, wouldn't that be the spot to see him?
[53:32.940 --> 53:36.220]  He's pretty shaved and oiled up sometimes, it looks like.
[53:36.240 --> 53:37.520]  Are there Bible cards we can open?
[53:37.700 --> 53:37.940]  Probably.
[53:38.320 --> 53:39.620]  Yeah, I'm sure we will find some.
[53:39.760 --> 53:40.160]  Giannis.
[53:40.600 --> 53:40.960]  All right.
[53:43.120 --> 53:45.440]  It looks like he's tearing out of the card.
[53:45.580 --> 53:47.820]  Like, his hand is, like, so perfectly...
[53:47.820 --> 53:48.260]  Oh, yeah.
[53:48.260 --> 53:49.300]  That's a really good one.
[53:49.320 --> 53:50.100]  He's escaping the card.
[53:50.180 --> 53:50.960]  That's a good one.
[53:51.000 --> 53:52.520]  He's, like, Roger Rabbiting it.
[53:52.760 --> 53:53.020]  Yeah.
[53:54.020 --> 53:54.820]  He's like...
[53:54.820 --> 53:57.220]  Great expectations.
[53:57.500 --> 53:58.500]  This is a...
[53:58.500 --> 53:59.480]  Who is that Chris Duarte?
[54:00.200 --> 54:03.260]  Looks like an insert, rookie, card, parallel thing.
[54:03.380 --> 54:03.760]  Not parallel.
[54:03.940 --> 54:05.160]  I don't know why I keep saying parallel when it's not.
[54:06.600 --> 54:07.940]  Honestly, keep saying it.
[54:08.000 --> 54:08.720]  We'll just fucking know.
[54:08.740 --> 54:11.900]  I'm just throwing words out there that don't match.
[54:11.980 --> 54:12.860]  Who was gonna call you on it?
[54:12.880 --> 54:13.140]  Andrew?
[54:13.840 --> 54:14.240]  Like...
[54:14.240 --> 54:14.680]  That's true.
[54:15.480 --> 54:16.260]  Who gives a shit about him?
[54:17.260 --> 54:17.660]  Okay.
[54:18.120 --> 54:18.620]  Bogdan Bogdanovich.
[54:20.040 --> 54:20.440]  Bogdan.
[54:21.640 --> 54:23.040]  Is he stepping on someone?
[54:24.000 --> 54:24.940]  He's stepping on his...
[54:24.940 --> 54:26.100]  He's stepping on the card.
[54:26.920 --> 54:27.660]  That's awesome.
[54:27.660 --> 54:28.560]  He's standing out of the card.
[54:28.640 --> 54:30.420]  Are you able to do that?
[54:30.660 --> 54:32.920]  You can use the card as a ladder to do a slam dunk?
[54:33.300 --> 54:34.160]  Yeah, apparently.
[54:34.380 --> 54:35.260]  If it's on photo day.
[54:35.640 --> 54:36.080]  Wow.
[54:37.620 --> 54:38.740]  Kenyon Martin Jr.
[54:39.120 --> 54:40.660]  Another young rocket phenom.
[54:42.220 --> 54:43.100]  Draymond Green.
[54:43.720 --> 54:45.140]  Everybody hates Draymond Green.
[54:45.260 --> 54:45.580]  Absolutely.
[54:46.360 --> 54:47.200]  Here we go.
[54:48.000 --> 54:52.160]  Devin Booker scored 49 points last night on the anniversary of scoring 70 points.
[54:52.340 --> 54:53.420]  Time to feed the dog.
[54:53.900 --> 54:54.840]  He gets his pill.
[54:55.000 --> 54:55.560]  But he already got it.
[54:55.560 --> 54:57.240]  He's ready to get his spirolactam pill.
[54:57.860 --> 54:58.780]  The orange pill.
[55:01.120 --> 55:02.040]  What do we have here?
[55:02.880 --> 55:03.680]  Doug McDermott.
[55:03.840 --> 55:04.640]  Devin Booker's nickname.
[55:05.280 --> 55:06.320]  What is Devin Booker's nickname?
[55:06.400 --> 55:07.540]  The orange pill.
[55:07.680 --> 55:08.380]  The orange pill.
[55:09.680 --> 55:11.840]  We just nicknamed Devin Booker the orange pill.
[55:12.160 --> 55:14.600]  In honor of the dog.
[55:15.300 --> 55:15.980]  That's a pretty good...
[55:15.980 --> 55:16.880]  That's a pretty smooth fit.
[55:17.020 --> 55:19.280]  That's a face to us, that one.
[55:19.460 --> 55:19.940]  That's pretty good.
[55:20.120 --> 55:20.940]  Oh, that is a face.
[55:21.040 --> 55:22.020]  He can't believe that guy's ass.
[55:22.300 --> 55:24.000]  Yeah, we'll put that in the fart on section.
[55:25.580 --> 55:26.460]  TJ Warren.
[55:28.080 --> 55:29.420]  Oh, this is a good card.
[55:29.620 --> 55:30.400]  That's actually a decent card.
[55:30.640 --> 55:31.280]  Scotty Barnes.
[55:31.480 --> 55:34.620]  He's probably third in the running for rookie of the year.
[55:34.780 --> 55:36.240]  He's had a great season, all season.
[55:36.880 --> 55:39.400]  He was doing really, really well when Pascal Siakam was out.
[55:41.160 --> 55:42.040]  And then...
[55:42.040 --> 55:43.320]  Power in the paint!
[55:44.120 --> 55:45.140]  Shaquille O'Neal!
[55:45.820 --> 55:46.680]  Show him the shag sack!
[55:47.900 --> 55:48.560]  Shag sack.
[55:48.680 --> 55:49.100]  Big shag.
[55:49.640 --> 55:50.860]  Why was he on the Scottish flag?
[55:51.120 --> 55:51.560]  Put him...
[55:52.580 --> 55:53.560]  I want to...
[55:55.020 --> 55:55.900]  Be like...
[55:55.900 --> 55:56.700]  He can...
[55:56.700 --> 55:57.640]  Oh, he can...
[55:57.640 --> 55:58.360]  Think he can hold...
[55:59.840 --> 56:01.560]  I want to see if he can...
[56:02.760 --> 56:04.040]  Do you mind if I bend it a little bit?
[56:04.280 --> 56:04.660]  Yes.
[56:04.860 --> 56:05.120]  Okay.
[56:05.640 --> 56:06.740]  Do you think this card was worth money?
[56:07.220 --> 56:07.980]  Not anymore.
[56:08.620 --> 56:09.180]  Shag attack!
[56:12.580 --> 56:13.400]  This rules.
[56:13.480 --> 56:14.760]  Thanks for coming, Emily.
[56:15.040 --> 56:15.360]  Thank you.
[56:15.560 --> 56:16.400]  I'm here to play.
[56:18.540 --> 56:18.980]  Clearly.
[56:20.200 --> 56:21.420]  Well, you're fucking around.
[56:21.580 --> 56:22.580]  Here's Jordan Poole.
[56:22.840 --> 56:24.020]  Not Jordan Peele.
[56:24.060 --> 56:24.600]  Shag attack!
[56:25.340 --> 56:25.600]  Jordan Poole.
[56:26.220 --> 56:26.860]  That was good.
[56:28.320 --> 56:29.200]  That was pretty cool.
[56:29.500 --> 56:29.940]  That was good.
[56:30.160 --> 56:31.280]  Definitely attacked that card.
[56:31.880 --> 56:32.700]  There's Jordan Poole.
[56:32.940 --> 56:33.620]  Not Jordan Peele.
[56:34.780 --> 56:35.580]  Boban Marijanovich.
[56:37.700 --> 56:38.500]  Andre Drummond.
[56:39.500 --> 56:40.780]  No longer with the Lakers.
[56:40.900 --> 56:43.320]  I believe he plays for the Nets now as well, because he is also old.
[56:43.440 --> 56:45.800]  He's wearing a Lakers jersey, but it says 76ers on the card.
[56:46.460 --> 56:48.960]  Yeah, and I think he got traded to the Nets in the James Harden trip.
[56:50.200 --> 56:51.000]  Kyle Anderson.
[56:52.080 --> 56:52.900]  Oh, here we go.
[56:53.060 --> 56:55.260]  Dennis Schroeder, who now plays as a Celtics card.
[56:55.380 --> 56:56.040]  That's a face.
[56:56.420 --> 56:57.620]  He plays for... he's German.
[56:57.840 --> 56:58.820]  He's a big skateboarder.
[56:58.920 --> 57:00.760]  It's a Celtics card, and he's wearing a Lakers jersey.
[57:01.020 --> 57:02.460]  And he doesn't play for either team anymore.
[57:02.460 --> 57:06.960]  Yeah, so this is a Celtics card where he's dressed as a Laker, but now he's a Houston Rocket.
[57:07.340 --> 57:07.980]  Go back one.
[57:08.600 --> 57:11.860]  That card looks like a guy missing a puppet.
[57:13.580 --> 57:13.980]  What?
[57:14.140 --> 57:14.380]  Explain.
[57:14.680 --> 57:15.060]  What?
[57:15.260 --> 57:17.020]  Like the other hand looks like he should have a puppet.
[57:17.020 --> 57:17.540]  Are you saying like a marionette?
[57:18.060 --> 57:19.420]  Like that should be the head.
[57:19.620 --> 57:20.460]  Are you saying the hand...
[57:20.460 --> 57:23.000]  He's confused because he's lost his sock puppet.
[57:23.220 --> 57:24.240]  Like, where'd my puppet go?
[57:24.380 --> 57:24.780]  Oh, I see.
[57:25.040 --> 57:25.980]  Where'd my puppet go?
[57:26.000 --> 57:26.900]  Where'd my puppet go card?
[57:27.000 --> 57:27.800]  Alright, we'll save that.
[57:28.180 --> 57:29.120]  I hope somebody's keeping notes.
[57:29.280 --> 57:30.260]  These are getting complicated.
[57:30.280 --> 57:31.540]  You said that like it's such a relatable experience.
[57:32.180 --> 57:32.320]  Yeah.
[57:33.340 --> 57:34.060]  I've never...
[57:34.060 --> 57:36.100]  You know how when you're missing a puppet...
[57:36.100 --> 57:39.060]  When you're doing a puppet show and you look over and you're like, where'd my puppet go?
[57:39.120 --> 57:42.040]  I'll be honest, I just saw the categories list and I just want to make more.
[57:42.200 --> 57:43.740]  Yeah, you're nailing it.
[57:43.740 --> 57:44.740]  Setty Oseman.
[57:45.940 --> 57:46.940]  I like him.
[57:47.020 --> 57:47.520]  He's a cool dude.
[57:48.280 --> 57:50.800]  That guy looks like somebody who just found a sock puppet.
[57:53.600 --> 57:55.020]  He's like, why is that there?
[57:56.340 --> 57:58.040]  Surprised by sock puppet card.
[57:58.180 --> 57:58.600]  There you go.
[57:59.740 --> 58:01.020]  Oh, here's Killian Hayes.
[58:01.060 --> 58:01.860]  Second year card.
[58:02.440 --> 58:04.020]  And then you're about to be up, okay?
[58:06.020 --> 58:07.120]  There's an orange laser.
[58:07.300 --> 58:07.740]  Save and leave.
[58:12.460 --> 58:13.900]  Is Killian Hayes a rookie?
[58:14.220 --> 58:15.120]  That's his second year card.
[58:15.160 --> 58:16.180]  He looks 12.
[58:17.040 --> 58:18.140]  He does look 12.
[58:18.260 --> 58:19.780]  It looks like a Disney movie.
[58:20.180 --> 58:20.540]  Oh, it does.
[58:20.840 --> 58:23.460]  Like when the kid goes into the NBA box, like a like Mike situation.
[58:23.560 --> 58:23.780]  Yeah.
[58:24.020 --> 58:24.500]  He looks like a kid.
[58:24.600 --> 58:26.440]  Looks like you can see a little bit of bellend there too.
[58:26.480 --> 58:26.760]  All right.
[58:26.840 --> 58:27.980]  Well, yeah, let's get that zoom.
[58:28.520 --> 58:28.660]  Zoom.
[58:28.720 --> 58:29.160]  Can we zoom in?
[58:29.260 --> 58:30.220]  Are we all zoomed?
[58:30.620 --> 58:31.620]  We might be at max zoom.
[58:33.160 --> 58:33.360]  Oh.
[58:33.560 --> 58:34.300]  Oh, hang on.
[58:34.580 --> 58:36.660]  We're looking up a bellend if you've just joined us.
[58:38.500 --> 58:39.060]  Almost there.
[58:39.560 --> 58:40.120]  Hi there.
[58:41.300 --> 58:42.340]  Yeah, it's talking to us.
[58:42.420 --> 58:42.740]  There you go.
[58:42.780 --> 58:43.300]  I can see it.
[58:43.480 --> 58:44.040]  Yeah, there you go.
[58:44.100 --> 58:44.460]  Pretty good.
[58:44.680 --> 58:45.100]  A little wiener.
[58:45.240 --> 58:46.220]  A little wiener poking out.
[58:46.360 --> 58:46.800]  There you go, man.
[58:46.900 --> 58:47.580]  Oh, is this the last one?
[58:47.620 --> 58:48.640]  This is the last pack of this box.
[58:48.720 --> 58:49.520]  I got two more of these, though.
[58:49.520 --> 58:49.820]  Don't worry.
[58:50.360 --> 58:50.760]  Oh, good.
[58:50.920 --> 58:51.820]  I was worried.
[58:53.760 --> 58:54.820]  It's got a good card to impact.
[58:56.780 --> 58:57.340]  Ricky Rubio.
[58:57.540 --> 58:57.820]  Nice.
[58:58.320 --> 58:58.600]  Man.
[58:59.380 --> 59:00.180]  Sad about him.
[59:00.400 --> 59:00.700]  Mm-hmm.
[59:00.920 --> 59:01.260]  Did he die?
[59:01.640 --> 59:01.920]  No.
[59:02.180 --> 59:03.580]  He's a really good player.
[59:03.780 --> 59:04.560]  His career might have, though.
[59:04.660 --> 59:04.920]  Mm-hmm.
[59:04.920 --> 59:06.280]  He tore ACL, I believe.
[59:06.440 --> 59:09.880]  He was having, like, one of the best years of his career was helping the Cavs destroy.
[59:10.300 --> 59:10.900]  Then he got hurt.
[59:11.040 --> 59:12.600]  And I think while he's hurt, they just traded him away.
[59:12.920 --> 59:13.800]  I don't think he plays for them anymore.
[59:15.580 --> 59:20.520]  Damonta Sabonis got traded to the Kings from nowhere Indiana to nowhere Sacramento.
[59:21.820 --> 59:22.880]  Lateral trade at best.
[59:24.300 --> 59:27.000]  Campbell Walker had a brief stint as a Celtic.
[59:27.300 --> 59:29.100]  Had a much longer stint being hurt.
[59:29.520 --> 59:32.100]  And I don't know that he's even playing anymore.
[59:32.300 --> 59:33.980]  He's got bad knees, unfortunately.
[59:33.980 --> 59:35.300]  Likeable guy, bad knees.
[59:36.000 --> 59:36.800]  Carmelo Anthony.
[59:37.040 --> 59:37.440]  Yeah.
[59:37.560 --> 59:38.880]  No longer plays for Oregon.
[59:39.300 --> 59:40.240]  Does not play for Portland.
[59:40.400 --> 59:41.300]  Plays for the Lakers.
[59:41.480 --> 59:42.060]  Yes, he does.
[59:42.620 --> 59:48.980]  Insane that he is playing basketball on the Lakers with LeBron James.
[59:49.100 --> 59:49.320]  Yes.
[59:49.480 --> 59:49.780]  Insane.
[59:50.180 --> 59:50.580]  Absolutely.
[59:50.760 --> 59:52.940]  Like, at the beginning of their careers, wild.
[59:53.680 --> 59:54.080]  Huge.
[59:54.280 --> 59:57.760]  They came into the league at the same time, or one year apart.
[59:58.080 --> 59:59.660]  And they were, like, opposites.
[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:02.380]  They were, like, vying for who was better for a long time.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:03.380]  And it was close.
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:04.740]  Melo was very good.
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:06.000]  He was out of the league for a while.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.080]  He was out of the league for a while.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.540]  He was, like, the...
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:09.260]  He was...
[01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:12.140]  Denver Nugget was a huge, huge star.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.300]  Moved to the Knicks.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:14.360]  Huge move.
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:15.740]  They tried to build a team around him.
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.080]  A lot of bad management.
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:17.380]  Yep.
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.840]  Eventually, he had a no-trade clause with the Knicks, which is hard to get.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.480]  And eventually, he begged to get out of that trade.
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:22.720]  Yep.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:23.340]  Out of there.
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.200]  And then nobody wanted him.
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:25.440]  Yep.
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:26.060]  He was on...
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:27.200]  Played for the Rockets briefly.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.560]  Played for Oklahoma City briefly.
[01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:32.020]  He was everywhere for a while.
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:32.260]  Yeah.
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:34.280]  And then he came back, and now he's a Laker.
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:34.860]  Now he's a Laker.
[01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:35.420]  Which is, again, just...
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:36.540]  Wild.
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:36.600]  Wild.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:37.940]  Interesting career trajectory.
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:38.660]  Yep.
[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:40.180]  Josh Jackson.
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:43.280]  You might remember him from Dawson's Creek.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.320]  There's a Dawson's Creek card.
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:44.600]  Mm-hmm.
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:44.860]  Mm-hmm.
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:46.660]  He dated his...
[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:47.820]  Pacey is what his name was.
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:49.100]  We'll put him on the...
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:49.760]  He's a TV star.
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:50.460]  Played basketball.
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:51.900]  Oh, here we go.
[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:52.580]  Kyle Lowry.
[01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:54.440]  Everybody likes that.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:57.240]  That looks like the ball is coming at his head directly.
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:57.860]  And he missed.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.780]  And the guy behind him is going,
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:01.160]  Oh, no!
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:02.320]  Yeah, it's bad.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.900]  He's about to get a ball to the face.
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:04.740]  Kyle, no!
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.180]  Oh, Josh Primo rookie.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:10.480]  That's a classic.
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.120]  That is not a Primo card.
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:13.880]  Andrew, does this also look like a Disney movie child?
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:15.340]  Once again, another child.
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:16.420]  Yeah, another Disney child.
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:17.320]  Looks like he's sitting on a...
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.760]  I believe he was an extra at high school music.
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.840]  Looks like he's sitting on an invisible toilet.
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:22.200]  Invisible toilet category?
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:22.640]  Yeah.
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.120]  And then, actually, a legit-ass hit.
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.340]  There's a LaMelo ball.
[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:32.040]  Second year, LaMelo.
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:34.160]  We'll go ahead and sleeve that.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.100]  This is a real party.
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:35.960]  Why was the owl?
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.140]  It's a little bit of a space owl, isn't it?
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:42.180]  It's a robo-owl.
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:42.440]  Yeah.
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.360]  So you put it in a case to put it in a case?
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:45.860]  Yeah.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:48.600]  Is that normal?
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:48.960]  Yeah.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.120]  Oh, okay. I don't know.
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:51.420]  That's normal. Totally normal.
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:53.760]  All right, you guys want to open up some Hollywood cards?
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:54.040]  Yes!
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:55.120]  Very excited about that.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.380]  What year are these?
[01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:58.500]  You got any rookies?
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:00.660]  Ninety-one.
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:02.520]  Ninety-one. Starline Incorporated.
[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:03.400]  It's a good year.
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:06.620]  I have a feeling we're going to get, like, a Dick Tracy Warren baby in this thing.
[01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:08.720]  What was the number one movie of 1991?
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:13.180]  And who won the best Oscar, like, for Best Picture?
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:14.440]  The best Oscar.
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:15.480]  Like, the best Oscar.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.900]  Like, what was the number one box office movie, and then what was the...
[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:21.980]  Let's see, 91.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.600]  Wild at Heart, maybe?
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:27.060]  I've never heard of that.
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.600]  It came out in 89, David Lynch.
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:34.100]  What do you think the biggest grossing movie of 91 and the best picture?
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:35.440]  Shawshank Redemption.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:35.860]  Okay.
[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:39.060]  Look Who's Talking 2.
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:39.620]  Okay.
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:41.860]  Both guesses?
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:42.340]  Yes.
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:43.100]  Ninety-one.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.140]  You're going to go, really? And that's what's going to happen, just letting you know.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:48.360]  Forrest Gump.
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:48.880]  Okay.
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:49.460]  No.
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:51.220]  No, Wayne's World. Wayne's World.
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:51.600]  Okay.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.220]  I think Little Mermaid.
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:53.660]  Okay.
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:57.540]  Highest grossing movie of 1991.
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:02.500]  Top grossing movies at $201 million.
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:03.860]  Terminator 2, Judgment Day.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:04.820]  Damn it, Terminator 2.
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:05.540]  That makes sense.
[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:06.820]  Best picture?
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:08.840]  Dances with Wolves.
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:13.540]  Terminator 2 is good, though.
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:14.220]  Yes.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.340]  The Clune.
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.600]  That's not who I thought...
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.460]  I was expecting the other Clune.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.000]  Yeah, that's not the Clune I was thinking.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:22.580]  It's the OG Clune.
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:24.060]  That's not what I was thinking of.
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:24.720]  It's the OG Clune.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.780]  Did not realize that George Clooney was from a famous family, but it makes a lot of sense.
[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:32.020]  Yes, mom, she was in a... what's that one movie with the... White Christmas.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:32.820]  Star Wars.
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:33.360]  Yeah.
[01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:36.420]  Jason Leslie.
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:37.560]  That's not what that says.
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:39.080]  Joan Leslie.
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:40.380]  No idea who that is.
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.000]  Mark, are you alright?
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.680]  I'm reading upside down here.
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:43.460]  I'm going to take...
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:44.740]  Why don't we just flip the picture?
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:46.000]  Connie Stevens.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:46.840]  Who?
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:48.460]  Why is this so faded?
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:49.400]  Is that...
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.120]  Is it old ass photos?
[01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:52.820]  Connie Stevens.
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:54.300]  What's she holding?
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.000]  A face?
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:55.720]  Death mask?
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.800]  She goes, this is for me.
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.320]  Yeah, it's a death mask.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.340]  Surely when you open this, I'll be wearing this.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.420]  It looks racist, is what it looks.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:04.920]  Yes, it does.
[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:05.960]  Looks a little problematic.
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:06.600]  Oh, okay.
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:08.520]  Oh, yeah, that is...
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.680]  She's in a kimono and everything.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:09.880]  Bone pile.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:11.160]  Here's Anne Southern.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:11.740]  Okay.
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:13.580]  Ava Gardner.
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:14.120]  Oh, nice.
[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:15.980]  These are a little pre-night you want.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.140]  Oh, shit, here we go.
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:18.820]  Definitely not who's on the box.
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:19.720]  We'll know...
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:21.300]  We'll be able to solve this mystery.
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:21.700]  Okay.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.340]  It's Robert Stack!
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:23.660]  Yeah!
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:25.300]  Look, he's got a gun.
[01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:25.860]  Yeah.
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:26.860]  Oh, boy!
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.140]  I like that...
[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:29.360]  Potter.
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.140]  These are great.
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:31.960]  Some of these cards, pretty good.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.320]  Some of these cards, not very good.
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:34.720]  Oh, we just got a certified hit.
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:35.140]  Yeah?
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:35.600]  Yeah.
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:36.120]  Here we go.
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:38.700]  Wow!
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.520]  Oh, my God!
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.840]  I'm gonna go ahead and sleeve Angela Lansbury right there.
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:44.080]  Beautiful.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:47.160]  We stan Murder, She Wrote here at Fuckface.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.540]  What about Bedknobs and Broomsticks?
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:49.160]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.320]  We also stan Bedknobs and Broomsticks.
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:51.680]  And Mrs. Potts.
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:52.840]  And Mrs. Potts.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:53.740]  This is pretty good.
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:55.420]  Esther Williams.
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.320]  That's Gus's wife.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.580]  Oh, here you go.
[01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:02.100]  Kirk Douglas.
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:03.020]  Nice.
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:04.520]  Just as fun as I'd imagine him.
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:05.800]  The youngest he's ever looked.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.380]  Ooh, here's a good one.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:08.800]  Eddie Albert.
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:10.220]  Everybody knows Eddie Albert.
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:10.940]  That's a smile.
[01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:12.080]  Look at that face.
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:13.640]  That's a million dollar smile right there.
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:14.820]  Yeah, he's selling you a used car.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:15.260]  Wah!
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:18.680]  I heard something about Kirk Douglas.
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:20.020]  Kirk Douglas is spinning.
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:22.520]  Charlie Chaplin.
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:25.440]  Yeah, this is a good classic.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:25.980]  That's a good shot.
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:26.600]  Charles.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.460]  Charlie Chaplin looks like if he tried to draw Hitler from memory.
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:33.020]  Right?
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.020]  Is that just me?
[01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:34.860]  Yeah, no, you're pretty good.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:40.340]  When we saw these cards, me and Gavin saw these and we were excited.
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.160]  Had them since day one.
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:44.220]  For who were on, like, there are like people on this where you go,
[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:45.360]  Oh, 1991.
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:46.240]  Hell yeah.
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:48.100]  None of who we've seen so far.
[01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:49.800]  Well, why don't we try and pull a 1991?
[01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:52.580]  Well, what if, what if, maybe let me change your mind here.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.360]  With a little bit of Bee Gees.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:56.960]  We've already seen Bee Gees.
[01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:57.340]  Oh!
[01:05:58.020 --> 01:05:58.040]  Hey!
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:59.820]  How about, you want to get a little more current?
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:00.700]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:01.680]  Gavin had a fun fact.
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:05.040]  Robin Gibb lived in my town.
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.400]  I saw him at Waitrose.
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:06.960]  Oh, yeah?
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:07.860]  Nice.
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.120]  At Oxfordshire.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:09.520]  Yep.
[01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:10.880]  You know who else lives in Oxfordshire?
[01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:11.580]  What?
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:15.180]  Jerry Hallowell and, uh, what's his face from Red Bull?
[01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:15.700]  What?
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:15.900]  Yeah.
[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:17.500]  Christian Horner.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.400]  They ride their horses out there.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:20.080]  They're always riding horses.
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:20.820]  It's a supermarket.
[01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:21.200]  Oh.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.560]  For the upper class.
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:23.880]  It's like Whole Foods.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:24.940]  It's like the British Whole Foods.
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:25.540]  It's like Central Market.
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:27.720]  It's a supermarket that I couldn't afford to shop at.
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:28.000]  Got it.
[01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:28.900]  I could work there, though.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:30.740]  He, uh, he cleaned the olives.
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.460]  That was his job.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:34.600]  One by one.
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.680]  That's how, that's how, they only have shiny olives.
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:38.200]  Olive, sir.
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:40.380]  Gene Autry.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:41.280]  All right.
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.520]  He was probably dead by 91.
[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:44.760]  Uh, John Forsythe.
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:45.440]  There we go.
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:46.580]  Some, uh...
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:48.280]  He doesn't look happy to be here.
[01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:48.900]  Doesn't look happy to be here.
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:51.220]  Take the picture.
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:52.540]  Frumpf.
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:56.480]  Here's the gambler himself, Kenny Rogers.
[01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:57.440]  Look at that hat.
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:01.780]  When you see, I love Kenny Rogers and his two big sons.
[01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:03.940]  His two giant sons.
[01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:04.900]  Have you seen his giant sons?
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:05.220]  No.
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.440]  Like children's sons?
[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:08.720]  Hey, Eric.
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:09.080]  Yeah.
[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:10.260]  What's a Tim Conway?
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:11.280]  Wow!
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.460]  Oh, about five pounds.
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:13.260]  That's pretty good.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:16.020]  Uh, Bill Harris.
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:16.980]  Who?
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.520]  Don't know, but that is a dog shit photo of him.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.280]  Oh, someone said Jeremy Irons lives in my town in Oxfordshire.
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:22.660]  Wow.
[01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:23.100]  Nice.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:24.280]  I think he lived in Watlington.
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:25.600]  Uh, Casey Kasem.
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:26.220]  Hey.
[01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:32.000]  If you ever wanna, if you ever wanna laugh, listen to Casey, angry Casey Kasem outtakes on YouTube.
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:32.620]  Yeah.
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:32.960]  Oh yeah.
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:33.860]  From America's Top 40.
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:34.840]  You're shaggy, right?
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.300]  Boy, he was also shaggy.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.380]  He was also angry.
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.120]  And did a lot of swearing.
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:41.640]  If you ever wanna hear Casey Kasem say, God damn it, motherfucker.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:43.960]  God damn it, motherfucker.
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.300]  God damn it, motherfucker.
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:49.740]  Very similar vibes to we'll do it live.
[01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:52.980]  Robert Young, anything but.
[01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:56.360]  Oh, it's an ironic name, I get it.
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:57.940]  Here's Chris Wallace's dad.
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:59.060]  Chris Wallace.
[01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:00.360]  Look at him.
[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:02.420]  That's his natural hair color, you can tell.
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:04.120]  Isn't he in 60 Minutes, or he was?
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.080]  He was, yeah.
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:06.140]  He's Chris Wallace's dad.
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:07.420]  Uh, he really is.
[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:09.120]  Chris Granger.
[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:11.020]  Uh, no, no.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.080]  I don't know who that is.
[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:13.880]  Oh shit, it definitely says Farley.
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:16.100]  Farley Granger.
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:16.760]  Farley Granger, yeah.
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:17.840]  Uh, here we go.

[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:19.500]  Hey!
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:21.920]  I'm gonna save that, cause I'm gonna...
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:22.580]  Yeah, it's a big one.
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:22.960]  It's a big one.
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:23.800]  Three categories.
[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:24.900]  He is in, uh...
[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:26.740]  It's either extremely...
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:27.200]  Go ahead.
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:27.620]  Go ahead.
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:29.560]  Extremely what?
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:33.260]  I was just gonna say, they're either extreme to be there, don't wanna be there at all,
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:35.760]  or seem to have no awareness that they're part of a training program.
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.400]  All of these are one of those three.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:39.640]  Yes, I agree.
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.060]  I feel like he would play Don Zimmer in the...
[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:42.920]  John of the Winners, yeah.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:44.060]  That's a good one.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:44.960]  What year did he die?
[01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:47.540]  John of the Winners is in two of my favorite properties of all time.
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:48.160]  Mork from Mork.
[01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:49.420]  He was Mork's son.
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:50.520]  He was, he was the baby.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:51.400]  And he was the baby.
[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:52.100]  Aged backwards.
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:52.720]  Benjamin Baby.
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:53.340]  Wow.
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:55.700]  And then, uh, he was also in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:57.180]  He died in 2013?
[01:08:57.860 --> 01:08:58.180]  Wow.
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:08:58.700]  John of the Winners.
[01:08:58.900 --> 01:08:59.620]  Yeah, that's a shame.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.220]  And then Ernie Kovacs.
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:03.300]  That's a cool mustache.
[01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:04.240]  That is a good mustache.
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.300]  He'll put that in the mustache pile.
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:09.180]  We've still got...
[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:10.360]  Fucking Christ.
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:12.040]  Okay, let's burn through these a little bit faster.
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:13.560]  Oh, damn.
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:15.120]  This is kind of a cool picture.
[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:15.860]  It's a bit of a wince.
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:18.020]  Oh, here we go.
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:20.960]  Gus's wife again, our first double.

[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:39.340]  Okay.
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:41.100]  For all you MASH fans.
[01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:43.340]  And then...
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:44.240]  Oh, I'll take this one.

[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:53.640]  Missed them.
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:54.400]  There you go.
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:56.680]  These cards suck.
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:57.940]  Yeah, let's open one more.
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:09:58.520]  One more.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:09:59.440]  Because...
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:09:59.800]  It's a pack sack.
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:02.580]  I will say, we looked at this box, and it is...

[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.320]  And then not...
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.200]  Like, Elizabeth Taylor.
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:17.600]  Great.
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:18.940]  Yeah, it's every...
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:20.820]  It turns out it's everybody who died in 1991.
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:21.640]  Yeah, pretty much.
[01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:23.480]  I didn't know these were in memoriam.
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:24.120]  Oh, here we go.

[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:27.980]  That's the one I think of every time I see it.
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.240]  They massacred my boy.

[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:33.240]  This is a good one.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:33.640]  This is a good one.

[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:46.140]  As they say.
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:48.060]  Mike liked that one a lot.
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:48.580]  Bacall!

[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.320]  I feel like Tito Puente was always on...
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.140]  I feel like he was always on Fantasy Island.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:56.520]  Mm-hmm.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:56.780]  Yeah.

[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:08.240]  He made Star Trek.
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:08.660]  He did.
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:08.980]  Oh.

[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:14.700]  Another Jonathan Winters.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.020]  Another Ernie Kovacs.

[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:24.900]  Wow.
[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:26.240]  That's a big-ass hat.
[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:29.720]  Wait, is that like John Ritter's dad or something?
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:31.080]  Is John Ritter from like a famous family?
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:31.420]  Let me see.
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:32.100]  Really?
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:33.440]  It looks like him.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:33.720]  Wow.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:34.580]  I didn't know that.
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:35.660]  He was a cowboy singer.
[01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:36.500]  Wow.
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:37.640]  Yeah, I knew he...
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:38.380]  Oh, he looks like him.
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.580]  Oh, no, that is...

[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:42.700]  He really does look like him.
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:42.820]  Yeah.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.420]  Well, I'm going to put it in the related to John Ritter description.
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:46.960]  All right.
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:48.720]  Jason Ritter's grandpa.
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:49.360]  Yes.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:49.920]  There you go.
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.700]  Oh, I didn't realize that Jason Ritter was third generation.
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:53.380]  That's pretty exciting.
[01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:54.380]  Let's...
[01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:55.000]  This is fun.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.220]  Let's mix it up a little more.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:56.600]  Let's see.
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:57.080]  What do we got?
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:57.460]  What do we got?
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:58.200]  What do we got?
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.500]  We got no Bond stuff.
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:01.680]  Redentulous.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:03.160]  I don't know where the Bond stuff is.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:03.580]  Here we go.
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:05.080]  Let me tell you a story about Alan and Ginter.
[01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:05.560]  Okay.
[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:07.200]  So, I've been...
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:11.000]  I found out recently, you know, there's a war going on.
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:12.640]  Why...
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:12.940]  Okay.
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:14.020]  I'm getting there.
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:20.000]  And so, in the process, the world's largest plane got destroyed.
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:21.100]  Really?
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:25.000]  The Antonov An-225 Miria.
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.560]  It's the only one in the world.
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:27.640]  And it got blown up.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.100]  But it's in the Alan and Ginter.
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.980]  There's a little mini card of it in last year's Alan and Ginter.
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:35.180]  So, I decided I wanted to try to get it.
[01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:36.840]  They're going for like a hundred bucks on eBay.
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:38.800]  So, I thought, oh, I'll just pull it from PAX.
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:40.420]  From Alan and Ginter PAX.
[01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:43.660]  But I'm fucking stupid in my brain, right?
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:46.500]  I think we all saw this turn coming, whatever it's going to be.
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:52.320]  I conflate Tops Heritage, Gypsy Queen, and Alan and Ginter as the same thing.
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:53.720]  So, you bought...
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:54.780]  So, I went to the card shop.
[01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:55.120]  Right.
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:56.100]  And...
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:57.720]  To load up on Alan and Ginter cards.
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:57.980]  Yeah.
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.300]  So that I could...
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.180]  So that we could try to get that Antonov card.
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:02.900]  Is this for real?
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:04.500]  Yeah, this is unfortunately for real.
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:05.600]  And I came...
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:09.360]  I left with all of this.
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:14.280]  Felt real proud of myself.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.040]  And I bought a bunch.
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:22.920]  And I said, oh, I'll try to get the Antonov card out of this.
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:23.880]  I bought a bunch of...
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:25.980]  I got in my car and I realized I bought a bunch of Tops Heritage.
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:28.060]  Not the right cards.
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:30.940]  Also, even if it was, wrong year.
[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:32.400]  I spent 150 bucks.
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:33.700]  What the fuck?
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:36.100]  I spent 150 bucks on this box of Tops Heritage.
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.140]  To get a plane.
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.140]  To get a plane.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:39.740]  Go to this.
[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:41.080]  And I would be on that.
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.080]  To get a plane that's not...
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:42.580]  They don't even have a plane.
[01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:43.460]  This is insane.
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.440]  Eric, give me the credit card.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:45.800]  No.
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:46.700]  But I did...
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:47.160]  Give me the credit card.
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:51.260]  I did go back today and they had this pack of Alan and Ginter, so...
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:54.300]  Well, yeah, they had a lot more last time you were there, so...
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:55.780]  So maybe we'll get lucky.
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:58.340]  If we hit...
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:00.620]  I'll give you $100 if we get it.
[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:01.300]  That'd be awesome.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.340]  Save me $100 and I'm gonna buy it on eBay.
[01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:05.220]  Alright, here we go.
[01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:06.300]  Alan and Ginter, World's Champion.
[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:07.600]  Six cards, not gonna be in there.
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:11.760]  Oh, it could be, actually.
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:12.660]  It might.
[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:13.180]  It could be.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:14.040]  It's not gonna be, but it could be.
[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:15.620]  I got a mini card.
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:16.020]  Here we go.
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:16.860]  Rod Carew.
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:18.620]  Roger Maris.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:20.800]  Looks like Blake Snell.
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:21.580]  Aw, damn it.
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:21.980]  I want that.
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.200]  Who the fuck is this?
[01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:26.980]  Oh, it's a World Leader.
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:29.320]  That's the mini card.
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.780]  It could have been the plane, but it's not.
[01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:31.500]  Where?
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:36.400]  What's going on in this pack of cards?
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:37.240]  Yoshidi.
[01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:38.440]  Andrew's still getting this pack.
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:39.980]  And then, here's...
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:41.680]  What is this?
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:43.860]  It could be further than what you wanted.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:45.920]  Whitmerryfield.
[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:46.940]  Yeah, so we didn't get it.
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:50.380]  Alright, so we got Blake Snell, probably the fourth starter for the San Diego Padres.
[01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:51.880]  Then we have a World Leader.
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:54.460]  And then, did you see Luis Gonzalez hitting that home run?
[01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:57.140]  Should we start a Not The Plane pile?
[01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:58.280]  A tiny little card.
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.300]  And then we got all these where we're not gonna get that.
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:01.440]  Well, yeah, we know that.
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.040]  So you have one more pack that it could be in?
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:06.600]  I might.
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:09.200]  I might have been able to snag two of those.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.280]  Or is it just the one?
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:13.460]  I think I might.
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:14.140]  I think I might.
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:17.800]  No, I also accidentally bought Gypsy Queen.
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.080]  Here we go. There it is.
[01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:22.700]  So you just started pulling out other things that aren't the thing.
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:26.380]  Once again, these three series are all the same in my head.
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.140]  Just like old-timey weird shit.
[01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:29.980]  Incredible.
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:32.960]  I got a lot going on in my brain these days.
[01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:36.280]  It gets all jumbled up and I don't think so good.
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.240]  But there's two packs of cards.
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:37.980]  I don't think so good.
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:39.180]  That's why I said you have another pack.
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:41.460]  No, it's one pack is just bullshit tops.
[01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:42.380]  The other pack is...
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.460]  But we do have this pack of Outrunning Enter.
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.420]  Okay. Or $100 if you get the plane.
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:49.940]  $100. Here we go.
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:51.980]  Yep, there's a mini card in there.
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:52.280]  Okay.
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:53.480]  Alright, we have...
[01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:56.540]  Ruiz...
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:58.440]  Here we go, Jared Waddle from the...
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:00.020]  That's...
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:01.220]  From Alabama football.
[01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:01.680]  Ball.
[01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:02.440]  Yeah.
[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:03.740]  Suarez.
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:04.780]  Then we have...
[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:05.300]  Oh, here we go.
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:07.800]  Yeah, what is this pack?
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:09.760]  Michelle Acres, soccer player.
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:11.140]  What's going on?
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:11.560]  Japanese politics.
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:12.420]  And then...
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:12.960]  Here we go.
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.680]  Here's Deep Sea Shiver.
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:15.540]  That's a lemon shark.
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:20.600]  This is the best pack ever.
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:23.040]  What is going...
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:23.560]  Where...
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.220]  I feel like I'm gonna get sick.
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:26.300]  What's happening?
[01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:29.000]  And then, unfortunately, the mini card was a Key Brian Hayes.
[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:29.760]  But that is a...
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:29.780]  What?
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:33.360]  That is a wiki card and that is also a...
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:33.740]  The shark?
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.600]  No, the shark is just a...
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:36.640]  That's a...
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:37.580]  Oh, the shark's a parallel.
[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:38.680]  No, the shark's not a parallel.
[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:39.620]  It's an insert.
[01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:43.840]  But the Key Brian Hayes mini card, that is a parallel, I think.
[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:44.980]  What's this?
[01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:47.420]  It looks like you told him that you're gonna have to fight that shark.
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:51.060]  He definitely doesn't look confident.
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:52.880]  He's like, I got my bat, let's go.
[01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:54.240]  Why does the shark have a card?
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.200]  Because it's a Deep Sea Shiver.
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:01.380]  It's a scary deep sea creature and they have a run of deep sea scary creatures this year.
[01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:02.240]  That was surprising.
[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:02.800]  That...
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.580]  I would have named 20,000 things before I named the shark.
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.560]  While we're at it, let's open up the Gypsy Crate.
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:11.820]  This is a good idea.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.100]  I think you can do this in a day, but do you want to take a nap?
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.720]  You're gonna cut your hand or the cards.
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:21.140]  Probably.
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:21.600]  Be careful.
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:24.280]  Dude, my hands are fucking...
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:24.900]  Beat up?
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:25.520]  Beat up.
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.580]  You have to listen to episodes for that one, sorry.
[01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:27.940]  Yeah.
[01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:29.660]  My hands took a pounding.
[01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:30.600]  What did we just record?
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:31.040]  57?
[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:33.000]  Yeah.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:33.880]  We just recorded 97.
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:36.980]  97 is gonna tie up a lot of loose ends.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:38.220]  It's a good one.
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.300]  Okay, so let's see what's in the Gypsy Queen.
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:43.520]  Which I think we can say...
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:44.720]  It's on the cards, right?
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:45.520]  It's on the package.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:48.940]  Let's see.
[01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:50.800]  Don't yell at me, yell at them.
[01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:54.140]  Okay, we got Alex Bone, rookie.
[01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:55.380]  Is that a rookie?
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:55.700]  Yeah.
[01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:00.180]  Lucas Golito.
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:02.060]  Here we go.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:02.400]  Gialito?
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.520]  Gialito, Ryan Weathers, Anthony Rizzo.
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:05.000]  Ryan Weathers?
[01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:05.700]  Rizzo.
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:07.220]  He's a Yankee now, isn't he?
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:08.400]  Oh, shit.
[01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:11.520]  Jackie Robinson, Brooklyn Dodgers.
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:12.500]  This is a...
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:13.560]  That's a...
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:14.080]  A parallel.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:15.000]  There's no name on it.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:16.220]  Yeah, it's a no-name parallel.
[01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:17.740]  That's actually...
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:18.300]  That's cool.
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:18.800]  That's pretty cool.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:19.600]  Put it on the shack.
[01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:21.360]  No, no.
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:21.760]  Shack, shoot it.
[01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:22.360]  Shack!
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:22.880]  Shack attack!
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:24.220]  Here comes the shack attack!
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:25.760]  There's value in this card.
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:28.680]  Give me your card!
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:33.020]  Shack, no!
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:34.780]  He's...
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.400]  He saw the shark and he became the shark.
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:39.300]  Shack attack.
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.440]  Shack attack, shack attack.
[01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:42.680]  Shack attack, shack attack.
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:43.760]  Oh, here he comes!
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:45.260]  Shack rookie.
[01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:46.180]  Shack rookie?
[01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:47.860]  Okay, here you go. Ready?
[01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:48.440]  Ready.
[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:49.300]  Okay, here it comes.
[01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:51.040]  That's pretty good.
[01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:51.560]  I think I gotta go.
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:52.420]  Yeah.
[01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:55.780]  And then, because we're a gaming-related company...
[01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:55.860]  Yeah.
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:58.040]  I bought a pack of Fortnite cards!
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:18:58.440]  Fortnite!
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:58.920]  Oh, shit.
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.020]  Series three.
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.240]  That means there are two previous series of this.
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:02.740]  Cool.
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.100]  No idea what this is going to look like.
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:05.940]  Can't build this season.
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:08.600]  Okay.
[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:10.140]  What do we got here?
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:11.120]  The Outrage.
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:13.460]  Branded Brigadier.
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:14.620]  Cringe.
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:15.660]  This is stupid.
[01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:16.720]  Is this better than Twin Peaks?
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:17.080]  Sparkplug.
[01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:17.360]  Cringe.
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:18.180]  This is trash.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:19.420]  Cringe.
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:22.620]  I don't even know how to say that.
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:23.100]  Pog.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.340]  Oh, here's a ski boot.
[01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:28.220]  Poggers.
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:30.040]  And that.
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:30.640]  Cool.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:31.040]  Cringe.
[01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:32.360]  That pack's cringe.
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.560]  Fucking set those on fire.
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:35.340]  Cringe.
[01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:35.980]  Here we go.
[01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:36.400]  This is nice.
[01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:37.620]  This pack right here.
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:38.760]  Fat pack.
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:39.100]  Yeah.
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:40.780]  Solo pack of this year's Donrus.
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:41.940]  It's $54.
[01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:44.080]  I paid $55 for this pack.
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:44.760]  These 30 cards.
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:45.860]  So, let's see what we get.
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:48.200]  Are there going to be autographs, possibly?
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:49.500]  Potentially autographs.
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:50.080]  Relics.
[01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:50.840]  Ooh, relics.
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:52.400]  Lots of numbered parallels.
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:53.540]  Lots of inserts.
[01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:55.040]  You'll get a bunch guaranteed at the back.
[01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:57.100]  So, let's get through it and see what we got.
[01:19:57.340 --> 01:19:57.700]  Okay.
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:58.460]  Sabin Lee.
[01:19:58.580 --> 01:19:58.980]  Sabin Lee.
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:00.360]  Clay Thompson.
[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:01.200]  Finally playing again.
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:02.180]  Where's the headband now?
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.160]  Didn't play for two years.
[01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:03.900]  Came back with a headband.
[01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:05.420]  Evan Fournier.
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:05.940]  Upgrade.
[01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:07.380]  Miles Bridges.
[01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:08.980]  I wish he was not...
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:10.540]  I wish he was assaulting.
[01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:12.220]  Derek Rose.
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:13.360]  Feel bad for him.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:13.560]  Yep.
[01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:15.180]  Davis Bertrands.
[01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:18.660]  But Davis Bertrands is our cartoon villain from earlier.
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.160]  From the spreadsheet.
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:21.760]  He was the one I said looked like a cartoon villain.
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:22.160]  Oh.
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:23.040]  Rashad Holmes.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:24.880]  Jalen Brunson.
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:27.140]  Jalen Brunson also is a pretty muscly dude.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:28.400]  Here we go.
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.000]  Alexey Pokachevsky again.
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:31.800]  He's about 7'2".
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:32.880]  He's a thin man.
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:33.920]  MPJ.
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:37.800]  Oh, this is N.A.W.
[01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:40.220]  Pat Williams.
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:42.360]  Markeel Fultz.
[01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:45.700]  This guy, this little guy right here, Markeel Fultz, Rookie of the Year.
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:46.500]  Not Rookie of the Year.
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:46.820]  I'm sorry.
[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:47.660]  He did not win Rookie of the Year.
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:48.900]  He was number one draft pick.
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:52.720]  And then he was broken by the process and has never recovered.
[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:53.520]  Oh, trust it.
[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:54.140]  Harry Scarland.
[01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:58.100]  The process so far got Joel Embiid and that's it.
[01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:00.680]  In seven years, it ended up with just Joel Embiid, which is amazing.
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:01.300]  Yeah, trust the process.
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:02.720]  But Taylor Horton Tucker.
[01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:07.020]  Taylor Horton Tucker, to me, every time I hear it, I think of a Dr. Seuss character.
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:09.100]  That's pretty good.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:09.980]  Taylor Horton Tucker?
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:10.360]  Yeah.
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:12.020]  Dr. Seuss.
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:12.540]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:13.220]  Horton hears a who.
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:13.980]  Taylor Horton Tucker.
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:14.820]  Yeah.
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:17.740]  Green Eggs and Taylor Horton.
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:19.200]  Karis LeVert.
[01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:20.420]  Karis LeVert.
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:20.820]  He's cool.
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:22.560]  Rudy Gobert.
[01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:23.200]  He's not.
[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:25.720]  It's patient zero in the N.B.A.
[01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:27.080]  Oh, didn't he touch all the microphones?
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:28.880]  Yeah, he breathed and touched all the microphones.
[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:30.000]  He thought COVID was funny.
[01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:30.280]  Yeah.
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:31.820]  Yeah, it very quickly wasn't.
[01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:32.000]  Yeah.
[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:33.600]  Yeah, he had to issue some apologies.
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:34.540]  Also, French.
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.320]  So, different sense of humor they have.
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.360]  Dorian Finney-Smith.
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:41.780]  This guy's name is always just fun to say.
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:43.540]  If you watch a lot of breaks, everybody says it differently.
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:44.600]  Isaac Okoro.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:45.520]  Okoro.
[01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:46.220]  Okoro.
[01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:47.260]  Pretty good.
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:48.560]  Scotty Barnes rookie.
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:49.440]  I'll take that.
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:51.700]  Joshua Primo rookie.
[01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:52.620]  Once again, not Primo.
[01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:53.780]  We already have that.
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:54.720]  We have that.
[01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:55.720]  Oh, that's the toilet one?
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:56.060]  Yeah.
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:57.340]  Here's Aaron Wiggins.
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.120]  No relation to Andrew Wiggins, I don't believe.
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:02.640]  Herbert Jones.
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:04.380]  Herbert Jones goes bananas.
[01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:08.660]  Herbie goes bananas?
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:09.180]  The love bug?
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:09.620]  No?
[01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:11.200]  Oh boy, that's...
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:12.100]  That's a deep cut.
[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:13.620]  That's a full...
[01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:15.120]  That's a Hollywood cut.
[01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:16.780]  Oh, here we go.
[01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:18.400]  Here is a press proof.
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:19.120]  Sadiq Bey.
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.440]  See how it says press proof right there?
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:23.720]  Yeah, he doesn't have to talk to any of the reporters.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.300]  Yeah, but he's press proof.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.380]  That's why you see the stands are empty.
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:28.220]  He doesn't talk to anybody.
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.920]  Looks exactly like the regular card, but it says press proof on it.
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:34.340]  Somehow that makes it worth more and rarer.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:35.160]  Here we go.
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:36.920]  Everybody's...
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:39.380]  I can't stand this dude with a fucking passion.
[01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:40.720]  One of my least favorite people in the NBA.
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:41.300]  Tony Parker.
[01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:44.160]  Fucking gross dude.
[01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:46.380]  Sorry all you Spurs fans, but...
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:49.240]  He ruins your team by sleeping with one of your teammates' wives.
[01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:50.160]  The whole thing.
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:53.280]  Here we go.
[01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:54.920]  This is actually nice.
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:56.340]  This is a press proof as well.
[01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:57.180]  Steph Curry.
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:58.440]  Did you keep the Tony Parker?
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.200]  Oh, Steph Curry's brother.
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.260]  Back to back Steph Curry's.
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:07.820]  Seth Curry's brother?
[01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:09.600]  Yeah, Seth Curry's brother.
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:12.560]  Oh, here we go guys. This is cool.
[01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:15.920]  Demonta Sabonis, numbered number...
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:17.060]  What was that?
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.060]  7 of 149.
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:20.020]  Emily, please.
[01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:21.520]  I just...
[01:23:25.230 --> 01:23:28.170]  So that's just a silver laser, I guess.
[01:23:28.290 --> 01:23:29.990]  And then another press proof, Trae Young.
[01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:31.790]  Boy, you know what that wasn't?
[01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:33.630]  That wasn't $54 worth of cards.
[01:23:33.770 --> 01:23:34.350]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:35.330]  Yeah, that was definitely wrong.
[01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:37.470]  That is appropriate.
[01:23:37.490 --> 01:23:38.750]  Give me the credit card.
[01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:42.730]  I think that you should give Gavin the credit card...
[01:23:42.730 --> 01:23:44.970]  and you go buy the cards for him to open.
[01:23:45.230 --> 01:23:45.970]  I'll buy so many Dench cards.
[01:23:46.650 --> 01:23:48.750]  We're almost out of time, so we're gonna open up...
[01:23:48.750 --> 01:23:49.190]  Very close.
[01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:51.590]  We're gonna open up this box of Optic from last year.
[01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:52.410]  It's a hobby box.
[01:23:52.710 --> 01:23:56.670]  So there's a good chance there'll be some high dollar cards.
[01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:58.730]  Andrew, how are you feeling about these pulls?
[01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:00.430]  $175.
[01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:04.910]  I mean...
[01:24:05.670 --> 01:24:06.890]  We got a shark.
[01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:10.050]  Yeah, Andrew, I feel the exact same way.
[01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:10.650]  We did get a shark.
[01:24:11.250 --> 01:24:12.790]  No Zim, one shark.
[01:24:13.170 --> 01:24:14.230]  You didn't even look for Zims.
[01:24:14.370 --> 01:24:15.890]  I like when Shack Attack happened.
[01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:17.370]  That was pretty cool.
[01:24:17.410 --> 01:24:18.230]  Shack Attack is very good.
[01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:19.670]  That's it.
[01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:22.030]  We got John Ritter's dad.
[01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:24.330]  We learned that basketball players don't know how to pretend to play basketball.
[01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:27.990]  Yeah, it's true. We did get John Ritter's dad and guys who can't play basketball.
[01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:29.350]  All right, we're gonna blow through these.
[01:24:29.530 --> 01:24:36.050]  Markel Fultz, Rui Hachimura, Pascal Siakam, Gary Payton, The Glove, as they call him.
[01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:38.550]  Oh, that was the whole pack.
[01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:40.090]  Yeah, there's only four cards in a pack.
[01:24:40.190 --> 01:24:40.570]  Oh, wow.
[01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:45.810]  Carmelo Anthony, Christoph Porzingis, Kenyon Martin Jr.
[01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:46.330]  There you go.
[01:24:46.810 --> 01:24:48.570]  Oh, here we go, Luka Doncic, My House.
[01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:50.350]  Wow, that's his house.
[01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:51.190]  That's where he lives.
[01:24:51.450 --> 01:24:52.790]  You're keeping all of these, huh?
[01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:54.190]  He lives in his heart.
[01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:55.330]  Well, yeah, I bought them, dude.
[01:24:56.130 --> 01:24:57.770]  You bought all of this?
[01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:58.070]  Yeah.
[01:25:00.090 --> 01:25:01.210]  I don't know what you're saying.
[01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:02.450]  I'm not keeping it for the show.
[01:25:03.150 --> 01:25:06.410]  It goes into a separate section that's just for show cards.
[01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:08.150]  It doesn't make it into my personal collection.
[01:25:08.230 --> 01:25:08.990]  That's what I was asking.
[01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:15.130]  When the company fails and we stop doing the podcast, then I'll migrate it to my personal collection.
[01:25:15.130 --> 01:25:19.690]  Kimba, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Kawhi Leonard.
[01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:20.290]  Yeah!
[01:25:20.930 --> 01:25:22.750]  Got the glove and the claw in the same box.
[01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:25.530]  Classic spur, Kawhi Leonard.
[01:25:26.290 --> 01:25:27.510]  No, they love him.
[01:25:27.810 --> 01:25:32.610]  Christian Wood, Wendell Carter Jr., Elijah Hughes.
[01:25:32.690 --> 01:25:34.310]  Whoa, that guy's head goes right into his neck.
[01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:35.270]  James Harden.
[01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:36.810]  Wait, go back to neck head.
[01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:38.490]  Oh, my God.
[01:25:38.670 --> 01:25:40.070]  It's like if a thumb was a man.
[01:25:40.350 --> 01:25:41.330]  All right, thumb man.
[01:25:41.410 --> 01:25:42.050]  We'll put that there.
[01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:42.990]  James Harden.
[01:25:42.990 --> 01:25:43.550]  Wrong team.
[01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:48.390]  I've gained a little bit of respect for James Harden this year.
[01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:50.410]  He just wanted to fucking play basketball.
[01:25:50.590 --> 01:25:51.050]  No bullshit.
[01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:52.310]  Sure.
[01:25:52.990 --> 01:25:54.870]  I was never a fan, but now I'm kind of digging him.
[01:25:54.910 --> 01:25:55.610]  Markel Fultz again.
[01:25:55.870 --> 01:25:56.610]  Fucking he's everywhere.
[01:25:56.730 --> 01:25:57.550]  Rui Hachimura again.
[01:25:57.890 --> 01:25:59.030]  Nick Richards, wrong.
[01:25:59.210 --> 01:26:00.030]  Charlotte Hornets rookie.
[01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:01.390]  And Kevin Durant.
[01:26:02.730 --> 01:26:03.670]  He's a spider too?
[01:26:04.170 --> 01:26:04.670]  He is a spider.
[01:26:04.770 --> 01:26:05.810]  You know what they call Kevin Durant?
[01:26:05.970 --> 01:26:07.090]  He rejected the nickname.
[01:26:07.230 --> 01:26:08.890]  He had the coolest nickname in the history of the NBA.
[01:26:09.050 --> 01:26:09.350]  What was it?
[01:26:10.050 --> 01:26:11.130]  The Slim Reaper.
[01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:12.690]  He didn't like that?
[01:26:12.690 --> 01:26:15.690]  He didn't like it because he had a coach that got murdered.
[01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:17.710]  And he didn't like being associated with death.
[01:26:18.450 --> 01:26:19.190]  So he's...
[01:26:19.190 --> 01:26:20.010]  I like the grim reaper.
[01:26:20.590 --> 01:26:20.990]  Durantula?
[01:26:21.370 --> 01:26:23.330]  They also call him the Durantula, but he doesn't like that either.
[01:26:23.450 --> 01:26:25.090]  I think Slim Reaper is better, but Durantula is better.
[01:26:25.090 --> 01:26:26.770]  Durantula sounds like it's almost like a bad reaper.
[01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:31.770]  Jonathan Isaac, TJ, Warren, Vernon Carey Jr., James Harden, my house.
[01:26:33.050 --> 01:26:35.110]  He's gonna have to fight Luca for their house.
[01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:37.070]  They're fighting over the same thing.
[01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:38.350]  They should change that to our house.
[01:26:40.830 --> 01:26:42.830]  It's a very, very, very shiny house.
[01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:44.690]  Otto Porter, De'Aaron Fox.
[01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:45.330]  I did those backwards.
[01:26:45.490 --> 01:26:47.250]  Lexi Pokachefsky, rookie card.
[01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:48.790]  Peyton Pritchard, purple parallel.
[01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:52.990]  That's a tongue twister.
[01:26:53.710 --> 01:26:54.350]  Yeah, but you nailed it.
[01:26:54.430 --> 01:26:55.090]  Just leave that, though.
[01:26:55.630 --> 01:26:57.110]  You just had to get warm after 90 minutes.
[01:26:57.170 --> 01:26:58.470]  You're fucking banging these things out, dude.
[01:27:01.110 --> 01:27:03.170]  How are you feeling about four cards in a pack?
[01:27:03.670 --> 01:27:04.470]  I feel okay with it.
[01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:06.050]  Danilo Gallinari, I'm used to it.
[01:27:06.090 --> 01:27:07.550]  Luke Kennard, still don't like him.
[01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:08.490]  Fred Van Vliet.
[01:27:08.610 --> 01:27:10.350]  Oh, shit, there's a prism.
[01:27:10.670 --> 01:27:11.070]  Brooke Lopez.
[01:27:12.730 --> 01:27:13.090]  Beautiful.
[01:27:13.390 --> 01:27:15.250]  Should we have a van name category?
[01:27:16.730 --> 01:27:18.470]  Because people with van in the name are cool.
[01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:19.690]  Yeah, we should have vans.
[01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:22.310]  We could have a fleet.
[01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:23.830]  That's what it is.
[01:27:23.890 --> 01:27:24.230]  Fleet of Vans.
[01:27:24.250 --> 01:27:25.210]  Add him to the van fleet.
[01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:28.650]  We'll have to find him later.
[01:27:28.730 --> 01:27:29.270]  Somewhere in there.
[01:27:29.290 --> 01:27:30.710]  We're just gonna open up these.
[01:27:32.650 --> 01:27:34.770]  We can open up as many as you want, Geoff.
[01:27:35.050 --> 01:27:36.390]  I know that you're excited about these cards.
[01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:37.930]  Alright, we're just gonna get through this then.
[01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:38.690]  And then we're done.
[01:27:38.790 --> 01:27:39.590]  Then we're gonna call it.
[01:27:39.710 --> 01:27:39.890]  Okay.
[01:27:40.410 --> 01:27:43.010]  I know you're excited about these cards, so I wanna let you open these.
[01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:45.190]  And then hopefully we can do these a little more frequently.
[01:27:45.230 --> 01:27:47.410]  Yeah, because otherwise I gotta wait a fucking month to open these.
[01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:48.170]  They'll kill me.
[01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:55.090]  Now that we're in a beautiful studio, we can have you in a space and maybe you don't have to get all of us all the time.
[01:27:55.290 --> 01:27:57.170]  And it can just be Geoff rifling through a bunch of cards.
[01:27:57.410 --> 01:27:59.090]  Serge Baca, you're trying to get out of doing this, huh?
[01:27:59.310 --> 01:27:59.910]  Clay Thompson.
[01:28:00.670 --> 01:28:01.390]  Elijah Hughes.
[01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:02.550]  LeBron James.
[01:28:02.770 --> 01:28:04.090]  LeBron James!
[01:28:04.210 --> 01:28:04.890]  LeBron James.
[01:28:04.890 --> 01:28:06.170]  Fucking video games!
[01:28:06.370 --> 01:28:07.370]  Yeah, that's a stupid parallel.
[01:28:07.650 --> 01:28:09.110]  Or insert. I hate that insert.
[01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:09.650]  Oh.
[01:28:09.870 --> 01:28:11.230]  It's so fucking dumb.
[01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:12.810]  Mo Bamba.
[01:28:12.970 --> 01:28:13.710]  One player game.
[01:28:13.930 --> 01:28:15.530]  I think his song is more famous than he is.
[01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:16.850]  Miles Turner.
[01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:18.350]  Andrew Wiggins.
[01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:20.950]  Oh, purple Bam Adebayo parallel.
[01:28:21.370 --> 01:28:22.310]  His house as well?
[01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:22.690]  Damn.
[01:28:23.770 --> 01:28:24.430]  Too many houses.
[01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:26.030]  It's like an episode of Cribs.
[01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.970]  Christian Wood.
[01:28:29.210 --> 01:28:29.930]  Wendell Carter.
[01:28:30.130 --> 01:28:30.830]  Blake Griffin.
[01:28:31.190 --> 01:28:32.150]  Shaquille O'Neal.
[01:28:32.530 --> 01:28:32.670]  Yeah!
[01:28:32.670 --> 01:28:33.310]  Shaquille O'Neal!
[01:28:33.330 --> 01:28:34.190]  Get him in there!
[01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:34.890]  That's a prism.
[01:28:35.050 --> 01:28:36.110]  That's a...
[01:28:36.670 --> 01:28:37.350]  That's actually nice.
[01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:38.430]  Shaquille O'Neal!
[01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:41.710]  There can only be one Shaq.
[01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:42.490]  He has to eat himself.
[01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:44.710]  Sounds like he's cleaning a spill from his tank.
[01:28:45.690 --> 01:28:46.910]  Let me get that for you.
[01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:47.490]  Clean up Gavin's Gatorade.
[01:28:48.730 --> 01:28:49.830]  Let me get that for you, thanks.
[01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:51.910]  Okay, what do we got?
[01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:54.630]  Left here...
[01:28:54.630 --> 01:28:55.530]  Mikhail Bridges.
[01:28:55.710 --> 01:28:58.010]  Not to be confused with Miles Bridges.
[01:28:58.330 --> 01:28:59.010]  Devante Graham.
[01:28:59.350 --> 01:29:00.070]  Kevin Durant.
[01:29:00.310 --> 01:29:01.190]  Andrew Wiggins.
[01:29:01.190 --> 01:29:02.790]  Oh, fuck, dude.
[01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:03.390]  Another prism.
[01:29:03.550 --> 01:29:04.150]  Those are...
[01:29:04.150 --> 01:29:04.570]  Nice.
[01:29:06.410 --> 01:29:07.110]  Thank you.
[01:29:07.870 --> 01:29:11.090]  I feel like you're getting some stuff from this, right?
[01:29:11.190 --> 01:29:11.930]  Oh, yeah, I'm getting some stuff.
[01:29:12.190 --> 01:29:13.510]  I'm getting prisms of characters I don't...
[01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:14.290]  Or people I don't care about.
[01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:14.850]  Characters.
[01:29:15.070 --> 01:29:15.410]  Characters.
[01:29:15.670 --> 01:29:16.570]  My favorite characters.
[01:29:16.630 --> 01:29:17.750]  Victor Oladipo.
[01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:18.790]  I think he's finally back.
[01:29:18.890 --> 01:29:19.330]  Good for him.
[01:29:19.630 --> 01:29:20.650]  He plays for the Heat now, finally.
[01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:22.310]  Karis Levert again.
[01:29:22.630 --> 01:29:23.310]  Zeke Nagy.
[01:29:23.690 --> 01:29:24.280]  Gordon Hayward.
[01:29:24.810 --> 01:29:25.470]  Purple Parallel.
[01:29:25.730 --> 01:29:25.770]  Yeah.
[01:29:25.950 --> 01:29:27.290]  Talked about ex-Celtics, right?
[01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:29.470]  Which ankle's the one that exploded?
[01:29:29.650 --> 01:29:30.570]  God, he's hard again.
[01:29:30.570 --> 01:29:31.330]  What?
[01:29:31.690 --> 01:29:32.050]  He had an exploding ankle?
[01:29:32.250 --> 01:29:32.430]  Yeah, he...
[01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:32.670]  Crumpled.
[01:29:33.650 --> 01:29:34.570]  You've never seen...
[01:29:34.570 --> 01:29:35.330]  Show him...
[01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:37.490]  Look up Gordon Hayward's injury.
[01:29:37.670 --> 01:29:38.730]  I don't wanna see it.
[01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:39.270]  It's not gross.
[01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.690]  It's not bad.
[01:29:39.710 --> 01:29:40.430]  It won't freak you out.
[01:29:40.570 --> 01:29:41.110]  It's just funny.
[01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:43.230]  It won't make you go...
[01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:44.010]  Out loud.
[01:29:44.230 --> 01:29:44.390]  No.
[01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:45.110]  Norman Powell.
[01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:46.090]  Kyle Kuzma.
[01:29:46.150 --> 01:29:46.910]  Ben Simmons.
[01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:48.310]  Jason Tatum.
[01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.990]  The Tiger.
[01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:50.150]  Baby boy.
[01:29:50.930 --> 01:29:52.190]  Future MVP right there.
[01:29:52.290 --> 01:29:52.390]  Yep.
[01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:54.810]  I think he's fourth in the running.
[01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:56.150]  I like that card.
[01:29:56.330 --> 01:29:57.050]  The T-minus card?
[01:29:57.250 --> 01:29:57.650]  The...
[01:29:57.650 --> 01:29:58.930]  If that's what it's called, hell yeah.
[01:29:58.930 --> 01:29:59.350]  Yeah.
[01:29:59.370 --> 01:30:01.050]  Looks like Austin Powers' time machine.
[01:30:01.230 --> 01:30:01.610]  Yeah.
[01:30:02.290 --> 01:30:02.830]  I think that's what...
[01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:03.550]  Alright, Dr. Evil.
[01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:05.890]  Alright, we're down to the last five packs of the day.
[01:30:06.130 --> 01:30:08.050]  Then we gotta go away...
[01:30:08.910 --> 01:30:09.810]  For a month.
[01:30:11.230 --> 01:30:14.010]  I'd love to know what's the most valuable card we've pulled.
[01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:14.910]  Goran Drogba.
[01:30:15.170 --> 01:30:17.230]  And if it's the most valuable card that we could have.
[01:30:17.650 --> 01:30:18.090]  It...
[01:30:18.090 --> 01:30:18.370]  It...
[01:30:18.370 --> 01:30:22.650]  The most valuable card we've pulled might be the autograph that we pulled of Johnny Bench.
[01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:23.910]  I was thinking about that the other day.
[01:30:24.250 --> 01:30:25.450]  Eric Bledsoe.
[01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:26.610]  Devin Booker.
[01:30:26.730 --> 01:30:27.730]  Isaiah Thomas.
[01:30:27.730 --> 01:30:29.090]  Oh, everybody...
[01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:29.510]  The original Isaiah Thomas.
[01:30:29.770 --> 01:30:31.590]  Everybody loves Isaiah Thomas.
[01:30:31.710 --> 01:30:32.210]  Gotta love him.
[01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:34.310]  He's a fantastic commentator.
[01:30:34.530 --> 01:30:35.330]  I haven't seen him more lately.
[01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:36.450]  Here's a Steven Adams parallel.
[01:30:36.910 --> 01:30:37.270]  Again.
[01:30:37.730 --> 01:30:38.450]  Everybody loves that dude.
[01:30:38.530 --> 01:30:39.610]  New Zealand, I believe he's from.
[01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:40.310]  Cool guy.
[01:30:42.150 --> 01:30:43.390]  We could collect Adams.
[01:30:44.110 --> 01:30:44.750]  Adams family.
[01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:45.670]  Make an Adams family of our own.
[01:30:45.670 --> 01:30:46.610]  An Adams family?
[01:30:47.110 --> 01:30:48.170]  We're on the same page.
[01:30:48.230 --> 01:30:48.790]  I love it.
[01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:49.550]  I love it.
[01:30:50.050 --> 01:30:50.810]  Adams family.
[01:30:51.930 --> 01:30:52.690]  Tim Hardaway Jr.
[01:30:53.090 --> 01:30:53.270]  Okay.
[01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:54.610]  His dad was Tim Hardaway.
[01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:55.730]  Played for UTEP.
[01:30:56.210 --> 01:30:56.970]  He was an NBA player too.
[01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:58.630]  His dad...
[01:30:58.630 --> 01:31:00.030]  His dad, a very good basketball player.
[01:31:00.190 --> 01:31:01.090]  Famously homophobic.
[01:31:01.530 --> 01:31:02.350]  Oh, Jesus.
[01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:03.610]  But it was a different time back then, right?
[01:31:03.790 --> 01:31:05.390]  Nikola Jokic again.
[01:31:05.730 --> 01:31:06.590]  I'm getting a call.
[01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:08.470]  Oh, it's probably the dog saying, where's my pill?
[01:31:08.970 --> 01:31:09.130]  Yeah.
[01:31:09.670 --> 01:31:10.270]  It was Henry.
[01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:11.790]  Kevin Durant.
[01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:13.510]  Bradley Beal parallel...
[01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:14.750]  Or another Prism.
[01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:15.930]  That's a fucking nice card.
[01:31:16.030 --> 01:31:16.690]  These are...
[01:31:16.690 --> 01:31:16.970]  Prisms.
[01:31:19.730 --> 01:31:20.170]  Fuck.
[01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:21.590]  Victor Oladipo again.
[01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:22.150]  Yeah, right, man?
[01:31:22.250 --> 01:31:23.150]  Paris LeVert again.
[01:31:23.250 --> 01:31:24.130]  Ben Simmons again.
[01:31:24.250 --> 01:31:24.730]  Kawhi Leonard.
[01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.970]  I'm just...
[01:31:25.970 --> 01:31:27.750]  I was just hoping for a good rookie or something.
[01:31:27.970 --> 01:31:28.550]  Famous spurt.
[01:31:28.730 --> 01:31:29.410]  Kawhi Leonard.
[01:31:29.950 --> 01:31:30.830]  Haven't had one of these yet.
[01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:33.410]  Oh, it's that wicked arcade again.
[01:31:33.770 --> 01:31:34.630]  Serge Ibaka.
[01:31:35.530 --> 01:31:36.330]  Klay Thompson.
[01:31:37.190 --> 01:31:37.310]  Wow.
[01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:38.610]  He could only hold the ball.
[01:31:38.690 --> 01:31:38.970]  Dynamic.
[01:31:39.190 --> 01:31:39.710]  He was fucking broken.
[01:31:40.930 --> 01:31:43.930]  He gets the order of a shiny card and he doesn't get it.
[01:31:43.930 --> 01:31:44.390]  Wait, go back.
[01:31:44.490 --> 01:31:45.430]  There's nothing going...
[01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:46.450]  There's not even a background.
[01:31:46.890 --> 01:31:47.090]  Yeah.
[01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:49.930]  It's because he spent two years on his boat.
[01:31:50.110 --> 01:31:53.330]  Fucking sailing around the Pacific Northwest.
[01:31:53.630 --> 01:31:54.390]  Cassius Winston.
[01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:55.130]  You're a guy in a mirror.
[01:31:55.130 --> 01:31:56.050]  Prism rookie.
[01:31:56.150 --> 01:31:56.950]  I gotta...
[01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:59.670]  Even though Cassius Winston's not a big rookie, I gotta sleeve that.
[01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:05.110]  It's just fun to do.
[01:32:06.450 --> 01:32:07.730]  And then, last one.
[01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:08.390]  Is this the last one?
[01:32:08.410 --> 01:32:08.970]  Alright, last one.
[01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:09.630]  Last pack.
[01:32:09.850 --> 01:32:10.890]  Last pack of the day.
[01:32:11.250 --> 01:32:11.750]  Oh boy.
[01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:15.330]  This could be Don Zimmer.
[01:32:16.210 --> 01:32:17.170]  Jackson Hayes.
[01:32:18.370 --> 01:32:19.330]  Chris Middleton.
[01:32:20.690 --> 01:32:21.650]  Eric Gordon.
[01:32:22.230 --> 01:32:24.290]  And purple James Harden, my house.
[01:32:24.290 --> 01:32:26.290]  He has his house twice, so he wins his house.
[01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.810]  He gets the house.
[01:32:26.890 --> 01:32:27.550]  So he gets the house.
[01:32:27.610 --> 01:32:29.430]  Got a house in Brooklyn and a house in Philly.
[01:32:29.770 --> 01:32:30.030]  Settled.
[01:32:30.670 --> 01:32:31.470]  Okay, there you go.
[01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:39.250]  Hey, thank you for coming over and hanging out with us for 90 minutes or so while we open up cards.
[01:32:39.330 --> 01:32:40.330]  You open up one more pack of cards.
[01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:41.410]  We're opening up one more here.
[01:32:42.350 --> 01:32:42.910]  Let's do it.
[01:32:43.170 --> 01:32:43.810]  Here we go.
[01:32:44.090 --> 01:32:44.550]  This is baseball.
[01:32:44.910 --> 01:32:45.290]  Here we go.
[01:32:45.470 --> 01:32:46.370]  Is that Verlander?
[01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:46.970]  No, who is that?
[01:32:46.970 --> 01:32:47.330]  I can't tell.
[01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:48.410]  Ryan Presley.
[01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:50.610]  I really can't see these upside down, so I apologize.
[01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:52.350]  Jared Dyson.
[01:32:53.330 --> 01:32:53.970]  Kendall Graverman.
[01:32:53.970 --> 01:32:55.270]  I didn't see.
[01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:57.050]  Don't know.
[01:32:58.510 --> 01:32:59.210]  Oh, here we go.
[01:32:59.310 --> 01:32:59.730]  That was Ryan McMahon.
[01:32:59.970 --> 01:33:00.490]  Chipper Jones.
[01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:01.110]  Platinum player.
[01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:01.670]  Oh!
[01:33:02.450 --> 01:33:04.410]  This is what they call a die-cut card.
[01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:05.030]  That's pretty cool.
[01:33:05.190 --> 01:33:07.710]  These are cool, except they're impossible to put in a fucking sleeve.
[01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:08.270]  Oh, that's fine.
[01:33:08.410 --> 01:33:08.770]  Try it.
[01:33:08.890 --> 01:33:09.490]  Put it in upside down.
[01:33:09.690 --> 01:33:10.790]  That's fucking terrible.
[01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:12.030]  Put it in upside down.
[01:33:12.090 --> 01:33:12.590]  Wouldn't that be easier?
[01:33:13.790 --> 01:33:14.630]  Then it's upside down.
[01:33:15.570 --> 01:33:16.250]  On camera?
[01:33:16.570 --> 01:33:17.090]  On camera?
[01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:19.310]  Such a...
[01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.730]  Getting afraid?
[01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:20.450]  Oh, nailed it.
[01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:22.630]  Oh, my God!
[01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:24.330]  I rose to the occasion.
[01:33:24.730 --> 01:33:25.450]  Yachty Air Molina.
[01:33:25.890 --> 01:33:26.030]  Yachty!
[01:33:26.370 --> 01:33:27.310]  That's a nice parallel.
[01:33:27.850 --> 01:33:28.770]  Or insert, rather.
[01:33:28.890 --> 01:33:29.510]  I keep saying parallel.
[01:33:30.050 --> 01:33:30.970]  And then there's trash.
[01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.850]  What are you doing?
[01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:32.130]  Oh!
[01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:33.710]  No one good?
[01:33:35.870 --> 01:33:37.250]  Geoff, how are you feeling about your pulls today?
[01:33:39.010 --> 01:33:41.290]  You got a Japanese world leader.
[01:33:41.530 --> 01:33:42.250]  You got a shark.
[01:33:42.250 --> 01:33:42.910]  I got a shark.
[01:33:43.450 --> 01:33:44.290]  That was the best pack.
[01:33:44.290 --> 01:33:49.750]  You have a very expensive, like, desert storm bomber and also machine gunner.
[01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:50.170]  Yeah.
[01:33:50.670 --> 01:33:51.330]  Sounds like this.
[01:33:51.330 --> 01:33:52.210]  This is a good card.
[01:33:52.510 --> 01:33:55.370]  I'm happy with the Lamello orange laser.
[01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.690]  Okay.
[01:33:56.170 --> 01:33:56.470]  Laser.
[01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:56.850]  Sweetheart.
[01:33:57.290 --> 01:33:57.810]  Oh, shit.
[01:34:00.970 --> 01:34:01.410]  Sweetheart.
[01:34:01.610 --> 01:34:02.870]  Alright, we'll see you next time.
[01:34:03.330 --> 01:34:03.990]  We did it!
[01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.550]  Oh, boy.
