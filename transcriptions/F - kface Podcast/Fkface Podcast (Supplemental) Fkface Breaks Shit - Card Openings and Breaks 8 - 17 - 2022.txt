[00:10.570 --> 00:12.050]  B-U-S-T-I-N?
[00:12.130 --> 00:14.530]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's where John Locke is from in Lost.
[00:15.610 --> 00:18.430]  The character from Lost is from Tustin?
[00:18.450 --> 00:19.650]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's from Tustin, California.
[00:19.990 --> 00:21.850]  When he does the whole, like, here's his backstory.
[00:22.390 --> 00:24.870]  Is that the claim to fame for all of Tustin?
[00:25.010 --> 00:29.190]  I don't remember. I only worked there for a while and then I didn't, you know.
[00:29.650 --> 00:32.350]  Hello and welcome to another episode of Fuck, Face, Break, Shit.
[00:32.730 --> 00:36.170]  A special shout out to you if you're from Tustin, California.
[00:36.170 --> 00:36.250]  Yeah.
[00:38.610 --> 00:39.850]  Just heard about it from Eric.
[00:40.010 --> 00:43.150]  Eric had a roommate in college that worked at Trader Joe's in Tustin.
[00:43.290 --> 00:46.310]  He had a little hat. We were saying that Don Zimmer's cool because he got a little hat
[00:46.310 --> 00:50.450]  and the little hat can go up like this and this is how he wore his bike hats all the time.
[00:50.730 --> 00:53.470]  And then he always went, dude, I gotta ride my bike to work.
[00:53.630 --> 00:54.810]  What's he up to now?
[00:55.070 --> 01:01.770]  Ian? He still lives in Orange County and he's the reason I got pizza tattoo.
[01:02.070 --> 01:02.490]  Oh, yeah?
[01:02.650 --> 01:03.750]  Yeah, pizza vacation tattoo.
[01:03.750 --> 01:06.790]  You can't see it on camera pretty good, but hang on.
[01:06.930 --> 01:07.770]  Nope. Hang on. Wait.
[01:08.070 --> 01:08.650]  Shack attack.
[01:08.910 --> 01:09.290]  Close enough.
[01:09.430 --> 01:11.790]  Oh, wow. Wow. We're gonna get a good shot of it on five.
[01:12.090 --> 01:15.230]  Hang on. It's tough. Hang on. I really gotta move that ankle.
[01:15.290 --> 01:16.170]  He's gonna pull a hammy.
[01:17.230 --> 01:18.750]  Hang on. You got it? Shane, did you get it?
[01:18.770 --> 01:19.830]  This isn't getting any closer.
[01:19.970 --> 01:21.050]  Put it on the square.
[01:21.430 --> 01:22.710]  What square? No, I can't.
[01:23.690 --> 01:24.290]  Shane, did you get it?
[01:28.510 --> 01:29.350]  Is that good?
[01:30.170 --> 01:30.970]  Is that worth it?
[01:31.370 --> 01:31.650]  Yeah.
[01:31.810 --> 01:32.030]  Cool.
[01:32.030 --> 01:33.190]  It was worth it to me.
[01:33.270 --> 01:33.550]  Great.
[01:34.070 --> 01:37.650]  Welcome to another episode of the Face Breaks Shit.
[01:38.310 --> 01:42.750]  With me as always, Eric. With me as often as I can get her, Emily.
[01:43.250 --> 01:45.490]  And not present today are the other two.
[01:46.050 --> 01:48.170]  But that's okay. They're busy doing other things that they do.
[01:50.290 --> 01:51.250]  Emily's so good at that.
[01:53.090 --> 01:54.430]  Definitely better than Gavin was.
[01:54.690 --> 01:57.550]  No offense to Gavin, but he put a Gavin amount of effort into being the soundboard.
[01:57.750 --> 02:00.970]  I'm not good at it, but I can admit it. I don't know if Gavin would admit that he...
[02:00.970 --> 02:03.370]  No. Never in a million years would he.
[02:04.650 --> 02:08.970]  So today we are going to have a pretty standard show. We're going to go for an hour.
[02:09.490 --> 02:10.210]  It's a quick one.
[02:10.210 --> 02:15.770]  It's a quick one. I curated this list, this box of different packs we're going to open up, hopefully.
[02:16.230 --> 02:20.430]  In addition to some of this other stuff we have out here, of course we've got the pack sack.
[02:21.370 --> 02:22.030]  Pack sack.
[02:23.050 --> 02:26.810]  And we are starting to accumulate a ridiculous amount of mail.
[02:26.810 --> 02:29.450]  So we're going to open a little bit of mail first, and then...
[02:29.450 --> 02:30.950]  We're not even going to come close to scratching the surface.
[02:31.230 --> 02:33.650]  I'm thinking, Eric, once we get this on a weekly cadence...
[02:33.650 --> 02:36.090]  That's the other thing, too. We're really trying to get this show weekly.
[02:36.210 --> 02:39.390]  And you might say, then just do it every week.
[02:39.810 --> 02:41.290]  If only it were that simple.
[02:41.730 --> 02:42.790]  But we're getting there.
[02:43.010 --> 02:43.530]  We're so close.
[02:43.630 --> 02:45.650]  We're so close. And before long it'll be...
[02:45.650 --> 02:47.230]  Oh, I can't say that's...
[02:47.230 --> 02:48.890]  Bad people took that...
[02:48.890 --> 02:50.310]  You can't thumbs up anymore.
[02:50.470 --> 02:51.890]  Are you okay?
[02:52.170 --> 02:53.370]  You can't okay symbol anymore.
[02:53.590 --> 02:54.610]  Just give a thumbs up.
[02:54.610 --> 02:55.110]  Yeah, thumbs up.
[02:55.670 --> 02:56.910]  There you go.
[02:57.890 --> 02:58.250]  Wow.
[02:59.070 --> 03:01.990]  Well, I looked up and realized I was doing like a white power thing.
[03:02.550 --> 03:04.290]  And I wasn't intending to.
[03:04.690 --> 03:05.310]  Stop talking.
[03:05.950 --> 03:09.070]  They took the okay sign from us.
[03:10.650 --> 03:11.350]  It's terrible.
[03:11.650 --> 03:12.550]  I agree. We should take it back.
[03:14.590 --> 03:17.310]  Anyway, when we do it weekly, I think one of the weeks...
[03:17.310 --> 03:19.770]  We'll just have a week where all we do is open up mail.
[03:20.030 --> 03:20.570]  Because there's so much of it.
[03:20.610 --> 03:21.670]  But let's open up some right now.
[03:21.730 --> 03:24.250]  Do you want to open the box of mail first?
[03:24.250 --> 03:24.950]  The one in the back?
[03:25.130 --> 03:25.730]  The one that's back there?
[03:25.910 --> 03:27.890]  I think that's the most interesting one.
[03:28.990 --> 03:30.390]  Very crazy that we got this.
[03:30.390 --> 03:30.770]  It's fucking heavy.
[03:31.070 --> 03:31.230]  Yeah.
[03:32.750 --> 03:34.250]  Very crazy that we got this.
[03:34.670 --> 03:35.010]  No, pass.
[03:35.010 --> 03:35.390]  No, you're good.
[03:35.450 --> 03:35.790]  Okay.
[03:36.470 --> 03:38.630]  This is from someone.
[03:39.030 --> 03:39.390]  Uh-huh.
[03:42.310 --> 03:42.750]  Okay.
[03:43.490 --> 03:44.690]  This is great for us.
[03:46.070 --> 03:46.770]  There we go.
[03:47.370 --> 03:49.610]  This is from...
[03:49.610 --> 03:50.390]  Hi, Geoff!
[03:50.910 --> 03:52.310]  Long time regulation listener.
[03:52.430 --> 03:52.730]  First time...
[03:52.730 --> 03:53.510]  Oh, it's a novel.
[03:53.790 --> 03:55.070]  This is from...
[03:55.070 --> 03:56.230]  I'll read it later.
[03:56.410 --> 03:57.290]  It's at the bottom on the front.
[03:57.670 --> 03:58.770]  This is from...
[03:58.770 --> 03:59.690]  Dude, it's Nick.
[04:01.190 --> 04:02.250]  Nick is from Georgia.
[04:02.570 --> 04:02.730]  Uh-huh.
[04:03.670 --> 04:04.970]  Oh, he sent some nice stuff.
[04:05.690 --> 04:06.870]  We might be able to get two extra tickets.
[04:07.070 --> 04:08.210]  Anyway, Nick is from Georgia.
[04:08.310 --> 04:13.970]  And Nick sent us a care package full of Savannah banana gear.
[04:14.670 --> 04:15.370]  If you're not a...
[04:15.370 --> 04:17.590]  If you don't know about the Savannah bananas, you should.
[04:17.650 --> 04:19.010]  Because they are the future of baseball.
[04:19.130 --> 04:19.330]  Yeah.
[04:19.890 --> 04:21.630]  They made baseball fun again.
[04:21.690 --> 04:22.310]  Yeah, it's cool.
[04:22.310 --> 04:23.330]  Their games are...
[04:24.070 --> 04:25.570]  All two hours are shorter.
[04:26.810 --> 04:27.830]  They do dances.
[04:28.490 --> 04:29.290]  A lot of stuff.
[04:29.310 --> 04:30.110]  A lot of TikToks.
[04:30.210 --> 04:31.170]  You know what they don't do?
[04:31.430 --> 04:32.650]  Performance enhancing drugs.
[04:32.850 --> 04:34.970]  Like some people in baseball.
[04:35.530 --> 04:35.790]  Some people have worms.
[04:36.070 --> 04:38.190]  And they have to take drugs for worms.
[04:38.990 --> 04:39.830]  Oh, that's cool.
[04:40.650 --> 04:41.190]  That's awesome.
[04:41.350 --> 04:42.370]  It's more than just a knob.
[04:42.730 --> 04:43.330]  That's really interesting.
[04:43.370 --> 04:44.130]  Yeah, that's the whole bat.
[04:44.290 --> 04:44.930]  They sent us the whole bat.
[04:45.070 --> 04:46.870]  Interesting they went with the whole bat.
[04:46.910 --> 04:47.430]  Not just the knob.
[04:47.650 --> 04:48.210]  It's weird.
[04:48.750 --> 04:50.350]  It has the logo on it and everything.
[04:50.610 --> 04:51.130]  Oh, here we go.
[04:51.130 --> 04:52.530]  Savannah Bananas Baseball.
[04:52.550 --> 04:52.970]  Very cool.
[04:52.970 --> 04:54.270]  That's very cool.
[04:54.450 --> 04:54.850]  I like it.
[04:55.030 --> 04:55.890]  Love it.
[04:56.110 --> 04:57.110]  And then...
[04:58.230 --> 04:59.190]  Fan first.
[04:59.570 --> 05:01.470]  Based on the true story of the Savannah Bananas.
[05:01.910 --> 05:03.650]  Probably by the dude that created it.
[05:03.690 --> 05:04.210]  Interesting guy.
[05:04.630 --> 05:05.090]  Interesting guy.
[05:07.090 --> 05:07.870]  Jesse Cole.
[05:08.530 --> 05:09.690]  Wears a lot of yellow.
[05:10.550 --> 05:11.550]  But it works for him.
[05:11.550 --> 05:12.690]  It's the banana thing, I think.
[05:13.210 --> 05:14.130]  I'll read that.
[05:14.310 --> 05:15.150]  Oh, there's a sticker.
[05:15.370 --> 05:16.470]  Multi-use decal.
[05:16.830 --> 05:18.630]  That'll definitely make its way on the set.
[05:19.510 --> 05:19.970]  And then...
[05:19.970 --> 05:21.190]  We're not done.
[05:21.570 --> 05:24.350]  Here's Go Bananas by Emily Cole.
[05:24.650 --> 05:26.910]  It's a kid's book about bananas.
[05:27.050 --> 05:28.470]  It could be a book for some adults.
[05:28.810 --> 05:29.750]  Yeah, some adults.
[05:30.690 --> 05:31.890]  We got ourselves a...
[05:31.890 --> 05:32.510]  Oh, nice.
[05:36.490 --> 05:37.550]  Well, you can see it.
[05:37.630 --> 05:38.050]  You'll get there.
[05:38.110 --> 05:38.970]  There's a...
[05:38.970 --> 05:39.690]  You'll get it.
[05:39.830 --> 05:41.590]  There's a...
[05:41.590 --> 05:42.090]  Pint glass?
[05:42.110 --> 05:42.670]  Pint glass.
[05:42.690 --> 05:43.870]  It's a pint glass.
[05:43.990 --> 05:46.190]  It says Savannah Bananas on it.
[05:47.490 --> 05:48.450]  And then...
[05:48.450 --> 05:49.190]  We're getting down to the wire.
[05:49.190 --> 05:51.570]  And last but not least...
[05:51.570 --> 05:56.930]  A four-pack of split banana cream soda.
[05:57.070 --> 05:58.670]  Wow, you should open one and have it.
[05:58.830 --> 05:59.670]  Is there booze in it?
[05:59.990 --> 06:01.390]  I think it's just cream soda.
[06:01.590 --> 06:02.290]  Oh, then I can have one.
[06:02.530 --> 06:03.430]  Here, we can check.
[06:03.510 --> 06:04.870]  Let me check before you do that.
[06:04.950 --> 06:05.490]  Do you want some ice?
[06:06.190 --> 06:06.610]  I don't have any.
[06:06.630 --> 06:06.890]  Nah.
[06:07.770 --> 06:08.170]  No.
[06:09.630 --> 06:11.250]  No, this is just 12 fluid ounces.
[06:12.230 --> 06:12.990]  No alcohol.
[06:13.050 --> 06:13.710]  A banana soda.
[06:14.310 --> 06:14.710]  Caramelized.
[06:14.830 --> 06:15.850]  Pure cane sugar.
[06:16.330 --> 06:17.390]  Purified carbonated water.
[06:17.550 --> 06:17.690]  Ready?
[06:17.690 --> 06:17.770]  Ready?
[06:17.930 --> 06:18.410]  Lemon juice.
[06:18.890 --> 06:21.290]  Two-fold natural vanilla extract.
[06:21.950 --> 06:22.110]  Yeah.
[06:22.350 --> 06:22.530]  Yeah.
[06:22.730 --> 06:24.510]  Are you okay with drinking sodium benzonate?
[06:25.430 --> 06:26.150]  Uh, I...
[06:26.150 --> 06:26.550]  Yeah, dude.
[06:26.550 --> 06:26.990]  Okay, cool.
[06:26.990 --> 06:28.330]  Then let's get after it.
[06:28.350 --> 06:29.870]  I actually have a sodium benzonate deficiency.
[06:30.030 --> 06:30.490]  So I have to.
[06:30.510 --> 06:30.570]  Oh, hell yeah.
[06:30.830 --> 06:31.670]  Sometimes I'm...
[06:31.670 --> 06:33.570]  I'm crazy!
[06:35.050 --> 06:35.650]  How's it smell?
[06:35.810 --> 06:36.290]  Smells good.
[06:36.970 --> 06:40.370]  I feel like the way you smelled and leaned back was like, I don't like cream soda.
[06:40.610 --> 06:41.170]  I don't.
[06:41.390 --> 06:42.110]  I don't like cream soda.
[06:42.710 --> 06:43.590]  I like banana cream.
[06:43.810 --> 06:44.430]  But I do like banana.
[06:44.790 --> 06:45.990]  It smells like a banana cream pie.
[06:46.570 --> 06:47.010]  Chug it.
[06:48.410 --> 06:49.490]  You don't have to chug it.
[06:49.730 --> 06:51.510]  Oh, that's good.
[06:52.150 --> 06:52.790]  That's not bad.
[06:53.330 --> 06:55.410]  I don't think I can drink a whole one, but I can sip on it.
[06:55.530 --> 06:56.030]  It's a sipper.
[06:56.350 --> 06:56.570]  Okay.
[06:56.750 --> 06:57.390]  It's a sipper.
[06:57.510 --> 06:58.190]  It's a dessert.
[06:59.510 --> 07:01.750]  The regular Coke Zero, that's dinner.
[07:01.890 --> 07:02.470]  This is the main course.
[07:02.610 --> 07:02.650]  Yeah.
[07:03.390 --> 07:04.250]  This is the app.
[07:04.450 --> 07:04.770]  Terrible.
[07:05.850 --> 07:06.470]  It's juice.
[07:06.770 --> 07:06.870]  Yeah.
[07:07.210 --> 07:07.710]  This is juice.
[07:08.970 --> 07:09.690]  Next piece of mail.
[07:10.250 --> 07:10.730]  There you go.
[07:11.150 --> 07:12.530]  There you go.
[07:13.270 --> 07:13.850]  You got it.
[07:13.890 --> 07:14.130]  Come on.
[07:14.130 --> 07:14.890]  All right.
[07:14.890 --> 07:18.370]  This is from Donald Donald.
[07:18.590 --> 07:19.130]  All right.
[07:19.150 --> 07:19.830]  Big Don.
[07:20.110 --> 07:20.350]  Let's see.
[07:20.530 --> 07:21.210]  Rip it.
[07:21.350 --> 07:21.710]  All right.
[07:21.730 --> 07:21.970]  Cool.
[07:22.050 --> 07:23.510]  Oh, that might have been part of...
[07:24.450 --> 07:24.890]  Yeah.
[07:27.710 --> 07:28.150]  Apologies.
[07:28.610 --> 07:29.130]  Let's see what we got.
[07:29.550 --> 07:30.330]  Thanks for shopping.
[07:30.690 --> 07:31.390]  My eBay store.
[07:31.610 --> 07:32.330]  I appreciate the patrons.
[07:32.510 --> 07:32.810]  Okay.
[07:33.110 --> 07:34.370]  Hello, Geoff and gang.
[07:34.510 --> 07:38.550]  Enjoy the new card in the Zimmer zone from Ben K.
[07:39.170 --> 07:39.530]  All right.
[07:39.750 --> 07:40.850]  What'd you get us, Ben?
[07:42.750 --> 07:45.230]  Oh, Donald is in the retired U.S. Navy.
[07:47.390 --> 07:48.950]  You don't need to read anymore.
[07:49.170 --> 07:49.430]  Okay.
[07:49.790 --> 07:50.490]  It's tough.
[07:50.930 --> 07:51.830]  All right.
[07:51.870 --> 07:52.250]  Throw it down.
[07:52.350 --> 07:52.550]  Let's see.
[07:52.730 --> 07:52.770]  Here we go.
[07:52.910 --> 07:55.610]  We got a little Don Zimmer to add to the collection.
[07:55.710 --> 07:56.330]  All right.
[07:56.970 --> 08:00.430]  When we build the Don Pedro project, that will be a part of it.
[08:00.530 --> 08:01.070]  It's a good green.
[08:01.110 --> 08:02.290]  Thank you so much, Ben.
[08:02.370 --> 08:05.210]  It's a reproduction of a...
[08:05.210 --> 08:06.190]  Oh, I can't tell.
[08:07.310 --> 08:08.390]  1953 card, maybe?
[08:08.510 --> 08:08.850]  Nice.
[08:08.990 --> 08:09.370]  It's gorgeous.
[08:09.370 --> 08:10.890]  Although, his rookie year was 55.
[08:11.010 --> 08:11.570]  I looked it up yesterday.
[08:11.710 --> 08:12.050]  Oh, really?
[08:12.190 --> 08:12.970]  Maybe it's back then.
[08:13.310 --> 08:13.750]  Yeah.
[08:14.410 --> 08:15.310]  Let's open up one more.
[08:15.390 --> 08:15.850]  One more mail.
[08:17.750 --> 08:18.530]  It'll be this one.
[08:18.910 --> 08:20.610]  This one's to Fuckface.
[08:20.670 --> 08:21.130]  That's us.
[08:21.290 --> 08:21.430]  Yeah.
[08:23.170 --> 08:24.050]  It's from...
[08:24.050 --> 08:24.890]  Also from Texas.
[08:25.550 --> 08:27.250]  They have a drawing of his wedding.
[08:27.850 --> 08:28.130]  Almost.
[08:29.970 --> 08:31.030]  Wait, what's the date today?
[08:31.670 --> 08:32.810]  Today is August...
[08:32.810 --> 08:33.390]  17th?
[08:33.510 --> 08:36.350]  Yesterday was Don and Gene's anniversary.
[08:36.670 --> 08:37.110]  Wow!
[08:37.110 --> 08:37.910]  We didn't even celebrate.
[08:38.570 --> 08:38.630]  Congratulations!
[08:40.210 --> 08:42.110]  They got married August 16th, 1951.
[08:42.790 --> 08:42.970]  Wow.
[08:42.970 --> 08:45.050]  They truly had a romance for the ages.
[08:45.150 --> 08:45.570]  Absolutely.
[08:45.570 --> 08:47.010]  It withstood the test of time.
[08:47.190 --> 08:48.190]  They were married at home.
[08:48.190 --> 08:48.530]  Oh.
[08:48.830 --> 08:49.270]  Really?
[08:49.510 --> 08:49.690]  Yeah.
[08:49.990 --> 08:50.670]  That's cool.
[08:50.930 --> 08:51.270]  Somewhere in New York.
[08:51.470 --> 08:53.350]  This is very cool, actually.
[08:53.550 --> 08:53.990]  What do we got?
[08:54.690 --> 08:58.930]  What we appear to have is a bunch of Kaiju Big Battle trading cards.
[08:58.990 --> 08:59.810]  Kaiju Big Battle.
[09:00.010 --> 09:00.470]  Big fan.
[09:00.810 --> 09:02.110]  I don't think I have a sticker on here.
[09:02.290 --> 09:03.090]  It's on my coffee thing.
[09:03.410 --> 09:05.070]  Kaiju Big Battle is professional wrestling.
[09:05.410 --> 09:07.250]  Yeah, it said, wanted to send you these packs.
[09:07.390 --> 09:09.730]  Kaiju Big Battle cards, because I'm sure it's a wrestling group.
[09:09.950 --> 09:10.330]  It is.
[09:10.370 --> 09:11.470]  Are known to our little rat.
[09:11.670 --> 09:12.050]  Mm-hmm.
[09:12.110 --> 09:12.390]  That's you.
[09:13.170 --> 09:14.610]  They are a group of wrestlers from Boston.
[09:15.910 --> 09:17.170]  Yeah, that's from Blair.
[09:17.330 --> 09:17.910]  Thank you, Blair.
[09:18.050 --> 09:19.330]  I have a friend who used to wrestle there.
[09:19.750 --> 09:20.650]  Do they have cards in there?
[09:20.670 --> 09:21.130]  They do.
[09:21.230 --> 09:21.590]  Probably not.
[09:21.730 --> 09:22.430]  They do.
[09:24.050 --> 09:29.370]  It's like a wrestling ring, and they'll set up, like, cities made of cardboard and stuff,
[09:29.410 --> 09:33.610]  and then everyone comes out, and they're, like, big monsters, and, like, they slam all
[09:33.610 --> 09:34.430]  over, like, the cities and stuff.
[09:34.430 --> 09:34.970]  It's really cool.
[09:35.050 --> 09:36.430]  I had a friend who used to work with them.
[09:36.610 --> 09:37.050]  Oh, really?
[09:37.150 --> 09:37.930]  Yeah, his name was Nick.
[09:38.090 --> 09:38.470]  That's cool.
[09:38.610 --> 09:39.190]  Back in the day.
[09:39.210 --> 09:39.830]  I don't know if he still does.
[09:39.950 --> 09:41.250]  It's just cool.
[09:41.350 --> 09:42.010]  It's good stuff.
[09:42.250 --> 09:43.530]  It was a fun idea.
[09:44.050 --> 09:44.770]  So let's see what we got.
[09:45.250 --> 09:46.890]  First off, I'm gonna put one of these in the pack sack.
[09:47.010 --> 09:47.470]  Yeah, nice.
[09:47.550 --> 09:48.870]  Maybe Dr. Cube is in here.
[09:49.110 --> 09:49.690]  Is that your friend?
[09:49.930 --> 09:50.210]  No.
[09:50.350 --> 09:50.930]  Is that your favorite?
[09:51.370 --> 09:52.510]  No, he's just, like, the guy.
[09:53.090 --> 09:53.550]  Who's your favorite?
[09:54.010 --> 09:55.030]  I don't think I have a favorite.
[09:55.350 --> 09:55.970]  Two-core.
[09:56.410 --> 09:56.690]  Okay.
[09:57.250 --> 09:57.690]  Pretty cool.
[09:57.870 --> 09:58.310]  That's pretty scary.
[09:58.750 --> 09:58.770]  Like a toucan.
[09:58.930 --> 09:59.150]  Yeah.
[09:59.630 --> 10:00.870]  Yeah, he's, like, a mean toucan.
[10:00.870 --> 10:03.070]  Got a Kung Fu Chicken Noodle.
[10:03.490 --> 10:03.850]  Nice.
[10:04.950 --> 10:05.670]  We got...
[10:05.670 --> 10:06.190]  Don Zimmerfill.
[10:06.510 --> 10:08.530]  Tad Bradley, Hawaiian paddler.
[10:11.830 --> 10:12.550]  Oh, here we go.
[10:12.950 --> 10:14.030]  Here's the Hellmonkey.
[10:14.290 --> 10:14.550]  Yeah!
[10:15.170 --> 10:15.970]  That's pretty cool.
[10:16.250 --> 10:17.830]  Michael, can we zoom in on Hellmonkey anymore?
[10:17.990 --> 10:18.750]  Look at that.
[10:20.010 --> 10:20.370]  Shroomatango.
[10:20.650 --> 10:20.950]  Wow!
[10:22.130 --> 10:22.670]  That looks great.
[10:22.750 --> 10:23.910]  You know, when we...
[10:23.910 --> 10:24.370]  Thank you, Michael.
[10:24.610 --> 10:25.930]  We would do events from time to time.
[10:26.270 --> 10:27.190]  Sometimes they would be there.
[10:27.710 --> 10:29.110]  Comic-Con is where we saw them all the time.
[10:29.210 --> 10:29.490]  Oh, really?
[10:29.490 --> 10:29.710]  Yeah.
[10:30.530 --> 10:31.490]  And then KidDeviler.
[10:32.390 --> 10:33.350]  Yo, these are cool.
[10:33.470 --> 10:33.490]  That's a sticker.
[10:33.490 --> 10:34.130]  These are very cool.
[10:34.210 --> 10:34.830]  These are awesome.
[10:35.050 --> 10:38.810]  I think the last time I saw these guys live was at an Xbox launch event or something.
[10:39.250 --> 10:40.170]  I'm gonna tell my buddy about this.
[10:40.210 --> 10:42.430]  He used to be on the street team, like, years ago.
[10:42.610 --> 10:42.790]  Really?
[10:42.810 --> 10:44.190]  He had an old Dr. Cube sticker.
[10:44.310 --> 10:45.110]  He's gonna be really stoked.
[10:46.530 --> 10:48.210]  We go to a lot of pro wrestling in Austin.
[10:48.910 --> 10:49.790]  It's a good wrestling town.
[10:50.330 --> 10:50.550]  Austin?
[10:51.050 --> 10:52.150]  I didn't know that about Austin.
[10:52.210 --> 10:52.990]  Great wrestling town.
[10:53.270 --> 10:53.530]  Huh.
[10:53.750 --> 10:54.490]  Home of Dusty Rhodes.
[10:55.630 --> 10:56.530]  Austin is from...
[10:56.530 --> 10:57.350]  Is where Dusty Rhodes is from?
[10:57.370 --> 10:57.550]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:57.550 --> 10:58.150]  The American Dream?
[10:58.310 --> 10:58.690]  Mm-hmm.
[10:59.570 --> 11:00.290]  Shroomatango again.
[11:00.390 --> 11:00.830]  Shroomatango again.
[11:00.830 --> 11:01.350]  Wow, he's everywhere.
[11:01.650 --> 11:02.390]  Everybody's looking to trade.
[11:02.490 --> 11:03.430]  I got doubles of Shroomatango.
[11:03.950 --> 11:05.390]  Metal Wing Black.
[11:05.530 --> 11:05.910]  Awesome.
[11:06.790 --> 11:07.190]  Shrooms.
[11:07.370 --> 11:09.370]  Oh, we got another Kung Fu Chicken Noodle.
[11:09.650 --> 11:09.870]  Okay.
[11:10.470 --> 11:11.110]  We got a...
[11:11.110 --> 11:11.670]  Oh, this is my favorite.
[11:12.010 --> 11:12.290]  Gee!
[11:16.890 --> 11:17.770]  And then...
[11:17.770 --> 11:18.450]  Ew.
[11:18.950 --> 11:19.750]  Gommie Mom.
[11:20.050 --> 11:20.390]  Ew.
[11:20.790 --> 11:22.290]  And then here's a sticker for...
[11:22.290 --> 11:23.510]  Oh, this is for you, Eric.
[11:23.990 --> 11:24.690]  It's Dr. Cube.
[11:24.950 --> 11:25.350]  Oh!
[11:25.350 --> 11:26.210]  Dr. Cube!
[11:26.790 --> 11:27.530]  Give that right to me right now.
[11:27.530 --> 11:28.110]  Oh, wow.
[11:28.110 --> 11:28.910]  Thank you.
[11:30.430 --> 11:31.490]  That's awesome.
[11:31.870 --> 11:33.870]  Let's set these aside for now.
[11:34.010 --> 11:35.050]  I'm putting Dr. Cube on my laptop.
[11:35.430 --> 11:35.770]  We got...
[11:35.770 --> 11:38.010]  Oh, we got a collection of Zims.
[11:38.550 --> 11:39.570]  There's that Zimmer.
[11:40.110 --> 11:43.910]  There's this awesome Red Sox Zimmer manager card.
[11:44.410 --> 11:45.530]  Here is...
[11:46.970 --> 11:47.510]  Tops.
[11:48.530 --> 11:49.430]  I've never seen this one before.
[11:49.510 --> 11:50.970]  I'm not sure what set this is from.
[11:51.610 --> 11:52.470]  Pretty sweet.
[11:53.110 --> 11:56.830]  Ooh, here's an old Cincinnati Reds Zimmer card.
[11:56.830 --> 11:57.150]  Nice.
[11:57.210 --> 11:59.430]  We got a bunch of Zims.
[12:00.150 --> 12:00.770]  Intentional Zims.
[12:00.950 --> 12:01.350]  I like it.
[12:02.590 --> 12:04.250]  I've never seen this Zimmer before either.
[12:04.410 --> 12:05.050]  There's that one.
[12:06.910 --> 12:07.270]  Here's...
[12:07.270 --> 12:09.470]  Boy, this guy was a wellspring of Zimmers.
[12:11.090 --> 12:13.690]  Here's another Zim I've never seen.
[12:14.050 --> 12:14.930]  That's a good squat.
[12:15.450 --> 12:15.910]  It is.
[12:17.410 --> 12:18.390]  He's got a good squat.
[12:18.530 --> 12:20.330]  Well, he was not the tallest dude, so he had...
[12:20.910 --> 12:23.550]  He didn't have a long way to go all the way to the ground, you know?
[12:24.710 --> 12:25.890]  1955 World Series champion...
[12:25.890 --> 12:27.570]  Oh, all right.
[12:27.790 --> 12:28.470]  That's pretty cool.
[12:28.610 --> 12:29.070]  Ooh, that's a good one.
[12:29.150 --> 12:30.930]  And then, this is one of my favorite Zimmer cards.
[12:30.930 --> 12:32.570]  Oh, the Padre Zimmer.
[12:32.890 --> 12:33.070]  Padre Zimmer.
[12:33.250 --> 12:33.910]  There he is.
[12:34.050 --> 12:35.910]  Do you think Zimmer ever took performance-enhancing drugs?
[12:36.170 --> 12:36.530]  Absolutely.
[12:36.950 --> 12:37.830]  A la Fernando Tatis?
[12:38.070 --> 12:38.970]  Yes, definitely.
[12:40.030 --> 12:41.910]  Do you think he put his dip in both cheeks?
[12:42.910 --> 12:43.990]  I bet he just...
[12:43.990 --> 12:46.870]  I bet he took a mouthful and then just chewed the whole time.
[12:47.030 --> 12:47.170]  Yeah.
[12:48.210 --> 12:51.010]  Yeah, he's like a skull guy and he just sort of like goes for it.
[12:52.590 --> 12:53.310]  That made...
[12:53.310 --> 12:55.870]  That made my stomach turn thinking about eating a lot of things.
[12:55.870 --> 12:56.110]  Dang it.
[12:57.450 --> 12:58.750]  Let's open one more mail.
[12:58.750 --> 12:59.170]  You're gonna do more mail?
[12:59.290 --> 13:00.170]  I'm gonna do one more mail.
[13:00.250 --> 13:00.770]  Oh my gosh.
[13:01.050 --> 13:01.750]  It's gonna be this one.
[13:01.830 --> 13:02.070]  Okay.
[13:02.230 --> 13:03.190]  This one's from Audrey.
[13:03.390 --> 13:04.110]  Okay, Audrey.
[13:04.630 --> 13:05.270]  I'm ripping.
[13:05.550 --> 13:06.250]  I like it.
[13:06.710 --> 13:08.690]  It's scary as shit.
[13:09.890 --> 13:10.550]  That's what I do.
[13:10.730 --> 13:10.970]  Yep.
[13:11.490 --> 13:11.810]  All right.
[13:12.310 --> 13:13.670]  Here's a lovely note from Audrey.
[13:13.870 --> 13:15.190]  Read on stream or don't.
[13:15.350 --> 13:16.130]  It's your show.
[13:16.290 --> 13:16.430]  Or don't.
[13:16.550 --> 13:19.250]  Dude, that's the best way to start a letter ever.
[13:19.290 --> 13:19.770]  Yes, it is.
[13:19.930 --> 13:21.130]  Hey, Face Crew.
[13:21.290 --> 13:24.850]  As a big fan of the podcast and baseball, I wanted to send some cards to commemorate
[13:24.850 --> 13:26.730]  the greatest baseball pranks of all time.
[13:27.090 --> 13:27.270]  What?
[13:27.470 --> 13:28.030]  This is awesome.
[13:28.330 --> 13:29.450]  This is my favorite kind of mail.
[13:29.650 --> 13:30.150]  All right.
[13:30.190 --> 13:31.070]  Let's get into it, Audrey.
[13:31.970 --> 13:32.450]  1982.
[13:33.950 --> 13:40.090]  Mariners manager Renee Lachman returns to his hotel room to find it completely empty.
[13:40.270 --> 13:42.190]  No lights, no paintings, no bed.
[13:42.470 --> 13:43.610]  He goes to the bathroom.
[13:43.850 --> 13:48.290]  There's nothing in there either, except the toilet is full of Jell-O.
[13:48.930 --> 13:53.490]  Lachman hunts for Mr. Jell-O for months until Larry Anderson reveals himself as the culprit.
[13:53.830 --> 13:56.710]  Also, Lachman's name is misspelled on his own card.
[13:56.930 --> 13:57.990]  So let's look at that.
[13:58.050 --> 13:59.950]  There's the subject of the Jell-O card.
[14:00.130 --> 14:00.150]  Wow!
[14:00.870 --> 14:02.690]  And he got his name misspelled on his own card.
[14:02.750 --> 14:03.570]  That sucks.
[14:03.710 --> 14:05.190]  That's Jack Patillo energy right there.
[14:06.490 --> 14:07.130]  Love that.
[14:08.390 --> 14:08.710]  2008.
[14:09.210 --> 14:09.490]  Uh-huh.
[14:09.730 --> 14:10.530]  Let's move on to the next one.
[14:10.610 --> 14:11.210]  That was awesome.
[14:11.370 --> 14:11.850]  I love a story.
[14:11.850 --> 14:12.170]  That's great.
[14:12.210 --> 14:12.810]  That's a good one, right?
[14:12.810 --> 14:13.210]  Love a story.
[14:13.210 --> 14:13.370]  Yeah.
[14:14.110 --> 14:14.430]  2008.
[14:14.510 --> 14:17.330]  Phillies manager informs Kyle Kendrick that he has been traded.
[14:17.830 --> 14:19.330]  Specifically, he was traded to Japan.
[14:19.390 --> 14:19.970]  Not a team.
[14:20.150 --> 14:20.930]  The entire country.
[14:21.550 --> 14:23.330]  He was traded, I assume, to a team in Japan.
[14:23.330 --> 14:27.030]  For hot dog eating champion Takaru Kobayashi.
[14:27.670 --> 14:31.230]  Kendrick goes to his teammates to process the news.
[14:31.490 --> 14:32.670]  They're all in on it, too.
[14:33.150 --> 14:34.690]  Even the clubhouse reporters are in on it.
[14:34.710 --> 14:37.070]  Interviewing him about the trade before revealing the prank.
[14:37.370 --> 14:39.030]  He thought he got traded for Kober.
[14:39.590 --> 14:41.170]  Let's see his face.
[14:42.430 --> 14:44.130]  I think this is an actual auto, too.
[14:44.510 --> 14:46.250]  Let me pull this off because it's covering it up.
[14:46.470 --> 14:47.410]  Give me just a second.
[14:47.510 --> 14:47.730]  Okay.
[14:49.010 --> 14:49.510]  Here it goes.
[14:49.630 --> 14:52.330]  You can tell that the dude is...
[14:52.330 --> 14:55.770]  Audrey is a real sports card fan.
[14:57.130 --> 14:58.170]  Painter's tape.
[14:58.590 --> 14:59.510]  Look at that.
[15:00.110 --> 15:00.950]  Going to Japan.
[15:01.150 --> 15:02.510]  Like an on-card auto, too.
[15:02.670 --> 15:03.070]  Pretty good.
[15:03.290 --> 15:04.430]  That is awesome.
[15:04.630 --> 15:05.130]  Those are great.
[15:05.290 --> 15:05.990]  Awesome cards.
[15:06.450 --> 15:07.530]  Even more awesome stories.
[15:08.170 --> 15:12.750]  Also sent us a pack of 1989 score baseball.
[15:13.590 --> 15:14.970]  Rare upside-down pack.
[15:15.190 --> 15:15.330]  Nope.
[15:15.930 --> 15:16.130]  Yep.
[15:16.390 --> 15:17.390]  You didn't see a lot of those.
[15:18.230 --> 15:19.810]  You only get them in hobby boxes.
[15:20.030 --> 15:20.290]  Okay.
[15:20.370 --> 15:21.110]  Let's see what we got.
[15:21.110 --> 15:22.110]  Here we go.
[15:22.190 --> 15:23.430]  From 1989.
[15:23.950 --> 15:24.710]  Tony Pena.
[15:24.910 --> 15:25.290]  Nice.
[15:25.670 --> 15:26.310]  Chet Lemon.
[15:26.490 --> 15:26.710]  Okay.
[15:26.970 --> 15:27.870]  Jose Uribe.
[15:28.150 --> 15:28.530]  Wee.
[15:28.570 --> 15:29.550]  Burt Bleileven.
[15:30.130 --> 15:31.610]  The man with the butt.
[15:31.950 --> 15:32.830]  Cecil Fielder.
[15:33.150 --> 15:33.450]  Nice.
[15:34.090 --> 15:35.130]  Greg Gross.
[15:35.750 --> 15:36.170]  Gross.
[15:36.490 --> 15:36.750]  Yep.
[15:37.070 --> 15:38.930]  1984 was a year to remember.
[15:39.330 --> 15:39.850]  Wow.
[15:40.250 --> 15:40.730]  That was pretty cool.
[15:40.830 --> 15:41.510]  Yeah, it's lenticular.
[15:42.470 --> 15:44.110]  I don't know what you were supposed to remember about it.
[15:44.170 --> 15:44.490]  Oh, no.
[15:44.930 --> 15:49.750]  That was when George Orwell prophesied the end of freedom.
[15:49.810 --> 15:50.790]  It's a trademark for the book.
[15:50.790 --> 15:51.350]  Bob Kempner.
[15:52.930 --> 15:53.750]  Cecilio Guante.
[15:56.230 --> 15:57.070]  Steve Lombardozzi.
[15:57.210 --> 15:57.730]  Don't remember him.
[15:58.790 --> 15:59.630]  Don August.
[16:00.350 --> 16:01.190]  Dave Bergman.
[16:01.570 --> 16:02.350]  Otis Nixon.
[16:02.510 --> 16:03.090]  I liked Otis Nixon.
[16:03.350 --> 16:03.430]  Yeah.
[16:03.730 --> 16:04.770]  Carlton Fiske.
[16:05.050 --> 16:05.210]  Cool.
[16:05.350 --> 16:06.370]  John Franco.
[16:07.570 --> 16:10.530]  Oh, here's a 1988 highlight of Mike Gleenwell.
[16:11.590 --> 16:13.210]  And it's a highlight of him dropping his bat.
[16:13.690 --> 16:15.570]  And then it said there was a spider on it.
[16:15.830 --> 16:16.590]  He picked it up.
[16:16.610 --> 16:17.330]  There was a spider on it.
[16:17.330 --> 16:17.810]  He dropped it.
[16:17.890 --> 16:18.490]  It was an action shot.
[16:18.850 --> 16:20.550]  And then Oral Hershiser.
[16:20.790 --> 16:21.950]  Not a fan.
[16:22.130 --> 16:22.530]  Boo!
[16:22.770 --> 16:26.030]  Hey, dial it back like three cards.
[16:26.810 --> 16:27.470]  John Franco?
[16:27.650 --> 16:27.770]  Yeah.
[16:27.910 --> 16:28.770]  What year?
[16:29.890 --> 16:30.310]  That's...
[16:30.310 --> 16:31.050]  89?
[16:31.710 --> 16:32.550]  This is 89?
[16:32.790 --> 16:33.830]  This is 89 score.
[16:34.050 --> 16:35.870]  That's why I was confused by 84 a year.
[16:35.890 --> 16:36.130]  Got it.
[16:36.370 --> 16:37.990]  So how many years...
[16:37.990 --> 16:40.890]  John Franco pitched until like the mid-2000s.
[16:40.950 --> 16:41.370]  Did he really?
[16:41.510 --> 16:41.810]  Yeah.
[16:42.070 --> 16:43.350]  Well, let's see how old he was.
[16:45.830 --> 16:46.550]  In this...
[16:46.550 --> 16:49.690]  1988 was his 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
[16:49.690 --> 16:51.110]  It's like his sixth professional year.
[16:51.130 --> 16:52.150]  I'm pretty sure John Franco...
[16:52.150 --> 16:56.590]  I watched a TikTok like two or three days ago where his daughter made one.
[16:56.670 --> 16:58.170]  She's like, rating my dad's cards.
[16:58.510 --> 16:59.270]  And it is...
[16:59.270 --> 17:03.270]  It's John Franco cards from like the early to mid-80s all the way to like...
[17:03.270 --> 17:07.790]  He's pitching for like the Mets or like the Phillies in like 2003, 2004.
[17:08.230 --> 17:08.730]  Good Lord.
[17:08.750 --> 17:09.510]  And it's like, damn, man.
[17:09.570 --> 17:10.850]  Well, you're like just a relief guy.
[17:10.970 --> 17:11.730]  That's fucking crazy.
[17:11.930 --> 17:12.110]  Yeah.
[17:12.110 --> 17:14.390]  But then you run into him and be in the show and he's just fucking...
[17:14.390 --> 17:14.970]  He's so hard to hit.
[17:15.270 --> 17:16.130]  He's just so hard to hit.
[17:17.870 --> 17:19.750]  John, a cocky closer...
[17:21.630 --> 17:24.610]  John, a cocky closer with one of the best change-ups in baseball,
[17:25.050 --> 17:27.570]  was the best left-handed reliever in the majors in 1988.
[17:28.190 --> 17:28.610]  That's...
[17:28.610 --> 17:32.810]  If you can throw hard left-handed, you could probably make AAA ball.
[17:34.030 --> 17:35.530]  If you could throw hard...
[17:35.530 --> 17:36.170]  And fast.
[17:36.510 --> 17:36.690]  Yeah.
[17:37.130 --> 17:37.590]  Left-handed.
[17:37.750 --> 17:39.970]  It has to go at least 80.
[17:39.970 --> 17:41.810]  I just gotta get past this arthritis a little bit.
[17:42.110 --> 17:43.150]  The spine arthritis?
[17:43.610 --> 17:43.750]  Yeah.
[17:45.210 --> 17:46.570]  Everything comes from your spine.
[17:46.950 --> 17:47.370]  Oh, okay.
[17:47.490 --> 17:48.790]  All power is derived from the spine.
[17:49.030 --> 17:49.230]  Oh.
[17:49.650 --> 17:53.810]  They want you to remember 1984 because that's when the Tigers ran away with the pennant.
[17:53.950 --> 17:54.170]  Yeah.
[17:54.370 --> 17:55.430]  I fucking hate them.
[17:55.510 --> 17:57.510]  That's the year the Padres lost in four.
[17:57.710 --> 17:58.570]  Oh, that's a sweat.
[17:59.190 --> 18:01.910]  The Padres sweep Cubs after losing first two games.
[18:02.030 --> 18:02.190]  Yeah.
[18:02.530 --> 18:04.490]  And then got swept by the Tigers.
[18:04.490 --> 18:04.770]  Yeah.
[18:04.770 --> 18:05.930]  And then the Tigers...
[18:05.930 --> 18:06.310]  It's okay.
[18:06.310 --> 18:06.350]  It's okay.
[18:06.430 --> 18:10.190]  We made it again in 1988 or 1998 and they got swept.
[18:10.470 --> 18:11.390]  I'll be here 15 years later.
[18:11.490 --> 18:11.590]  Yeah.
[18:11.690 --> 18:13.630]  And got swept by the New York Yankees.
[18:14.070 --> 18:16.530]  We've been to the World Series twice and have never won a game.
[18:16.690 --> 18:17.730]  If you want, I can give you that.
[18:17.750 --> 18:18.330]  You can burn it later.
[18:18.490 --> 18:18.730]  Yeah.
[18:18.810 --> 18:19.630]  I'll think about it.
[18:19.690 --> 18:20.590]  Uh, let's...
[18:20.590 --> 18:20.950]  We're Pac-Sac?
[18:21.010 --> 18:21.890]  Grab something from the Pac-Sac.
[18:21.930 --> 18:22.090]  All right.
[18:22.250 --> 18:22.810]  See what's up.
[18:23.250 --> 18:24.710]  Today we have...
[18:24.710 --> 18:24.930]  Oh!
[18:25.430 --> 18:25.790]  Awesome!
[18:26.030 --> 18:26.730]  Come on!
[18:27.130 --> 18:27.870]  That's totally random.
[18:28.270 --> 18:28.470]  No!
[18:28.510 --> 18:30.030]  We got Umbrella Academy cards.
[18:30.170 --> 18:31.910]  This is for Rebecca out there if you're out there.
[18:32.350 --> 18:33.830]  These are the worst cards.
[18:33.850 --> 18:34.770]  I know, they are.
[18:34.770 --> 18:36.030]  These are my mouth, Daddy.
[18:36.150 --> 18:36.430]  Fuck.
[18:36.630 --> 18:36.830]  Dude.
[18:38.090 --> 18:38.450]  This...
[18:38.450 --> 18:39.910]  This is the box that won't die.
[18:39.930 --> 18:41.070]  They will not go away.
[18:41.250 --> 18:43.890]  I feel like we've opened Umbrella cards on every break show.
[18:43.910 --> 18:44.510]  I hate it.
[18:44.530 --> 18:45.350]  Uh, there we go.
[18:45.410 --> 18:45.930]  Seen it before?
[18:46.650 --> 18:47.750]  Run, boy, run.
[18:48.030 --> 18:48.410]  Yep, seen it before.
[18:48.530 --> 18:49.430]  Dude, just watched season three.
[18:49.570 --> 18:49.790]  Uh-huh.
[18:49.810 --> 18:50.410]  So good.
[18:50.530 --> 18:50.750]  Uh-huh.
[18:50.870 --> 18:52.150]  There's, uh, Man on the Moon.
[18:52.190 --> 18:52.810]  Yep, seen it before.
[18:52.910 --> 18:53.770]  Yeah, Man on the Moon.
[18:54.590 --> 18:56.370]  And, uh, The Day That Was.
[18:56.710 --> 18:56.930]  Ooh.
[18:56.970 --> 18:57.510]  And, uh...
[18:57.510 --> 18:58.210]  Ooh, Run, Boy, Run.
[18:58.390 --> 18:59.250]  So those are all action.
[18:59.370 --> 19:00.650]  There's five right there, number five.
[19:00.810 --> 19:01.450]  That's a good stare.
[19:01.650 --> 19:03.770]  Talking to...
[19:03.770 --> 19:04.550]  I don't know who he's talking to in that photo.
[19:05.010 --> 19:05.690]  Yep, yep.
[19:05.730 --> 19:06.710]  That was a dud, that pack.
[19:06.810 --> 19:06.930]  Yep.
[19:07.990 --> 19:09.530]  Let's get into your curated playlists.
[19:09.550 --> 19:10.030]  Let's get into it.
[19:10.050 --> 19:10.810]  All right, we're gonna start with...
[19:13.270 --> 19:13.830]  1989, Tops.
[19:14.070 --> 19:15.130]  Is that not what we just...
[19:15.550 --> 19:16.870]  No, that was Score we were opening.
[19:17.230 --> 19:18.070]  Oh, I can't believe we did that.
[19:18.070 --> 19:18.570]  This is Tops.
[19:19.150 --> 19:23.810]  In Tops, we have the potential of pulling...
[19:23.810 --> 19:24.350]  A Don Zimmer.
[19:25.110 --> 19:25.390]  Okay.
[19:25.430 --> 19:27.250]  He was not in the Score cards, but he was in the Top cards.
[19:27.270 --> 19:27.630]  Let's do it.
[19:27.790 --> 19:28.130]  So let's see.
[19:28.170 --> 19:29.430]  Maybe we'll get lucky and hit his in.
[19:29.510 --> 19:29.750]  Here we go.
[19:29.810 --> 19:30.590]  Mickey Brantley.
[19:30.690 --> 19:30.970]  Okay.
[19:31.770 --> 19:32.330]  Frank Viola.
[19:32.770 --> 19:33.030]  That's a good smile.
[19:33.470 --> 19:33.750]  Oswald.
[19:34.750 --> 19:35.970]  I can't read that upside down.
[19:36.030 --> 19:36.350]  Peraza.
[19:37.470 --> 19:38.110]  Jim Presley.
[19:38.350 --> 19:38.950]  Lance Johnson.
[19:39.210 --> 19:40.350]  I wonder how many of these people are dead now.
[19:41.170 --> 19:41.810]  Raphael Santana.
[19:42.530 --> 19:42.930]  Geoff Montgomery.
[19:42.930 --> 19:43.290]  He's confused.
[19:43.530 --> 19:44.410]  Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[19:44.790 --> 19:45.750]  What is he...
[19:45.750 --> 19:46.270]  No, go...
[19:46.270 --> 19:47.530]  What is he confused about?
[19:49.070 --> 19:49.390]  Oh!
[19:50.110 --> 19:51.370]  You can't see that upside down.
[19:51.410 --> 19:52.290]  Upside down, he doesn't look confused.
[19:52.410 --> 19:53.690]  He is definitely confused.
[19:54.070 --> 19:54.550]  That's a...
[19:54.550 --> 19:55.410]  I think that's a keeper.
[19:56.010 --> 19:56.530]  That's a keeper.
[19:56.610 --> 19:57.290]  We'll figure out.
[19:58.090 --> 19:59.250]  Like, we should have a...
[19:59.250 --> 20:00.630]  Like, what is he confused by?
[20:00.810 --> 20:01.450]  No, like, this item.
[20:01.570 --> 20:02.030]  It was pretty good.
[20:02.490 --> 20:03.490]  Randy St. Clair.
[20:03.570 --> 20:03.730]  Okay.
[20:03.730 --> 20:05.470]  Les Straker.
[20:05.570 --> 20:06.270]  I've never heard of him.
[20:06.710 --> 20:07.630]  Rick Mahler.
[20:08.890 --> 20:09.930]  Tracy Jones.
[20:10.030 --> 20:11.110]  God, I remember the Expos.
[20:11.290 --> 20:12.610]  Just a great logo.
[20:12.810 --> 20:13.010]  Great logo.
[20:13.010 --> 20:13.730]  Just a great logo.
[20:13.830 --> 20:14.530]  Great logo.
[20:14.970 --> 20:15.790]  Carmen Castillo.
[20:15.890 --> 20:16.670]  Totally agree with you.
[20:16.950 --> 20:17.770]  Charlie Puglio.
[20:18.310 --> 20:18.570]  Ah!
[20:18.770 --> 20:20.370]  Jim Leland, manager card.
[20:20.550 --> 20:21.310]  We were close.
[20:21.690 --> 20:22.390]  Great mustache.
[20:22.610 --> 20:25.950]  Jim Leland, manager for a long, long, long time.
[20:26.450 --> 20:27.030]  Long time.
[20:27.290 --> 20:28.330]  That's from 89?
[20:28.550 --> 20:28.930]  It was 89.
[20:29.050 --> 20:29.850]  Jesus, dude.
[20:30.010 --> 20:30.670]  Dave Righetti.
[20:32.650 --> 20:33.430]  All right.
[20:33.430 --> 20:34.090]  No Zimmer.
[20:34.330 --> 20:34.950]  No Zim yet.
[20:35.370 --> 20:36.570]  Maybe in this next pack.
[20:36.670 --> 20:37.250]  Here's a little something.
[20:37.350 --> 20:37.810]  All right.
[20:38.330 --> 20:39.210]  I have here something.
[20:39.410 --> 20:40.130]  I was holding this off.
[20:40.370 --> 20:46.330]  Holding off on these for a while for, once again, for Andrew and Gavin, but at some point,
[20:46.510 --> 20:47.590]  we just have to move forward.
[20:48.130 --> 20:51.510]  So, I'm going to, first off, I'm going to put this in the pack sack, because I have a
[20:51.510 --> 20:51.770]  little more.
[20:51.830 --> 20:52.250]  All right.
[20:52.290 --> 20:53.130]  This is...
[20:53.130 --> 20:54.130]  Because that's how it works.
[20:55.030 --> 20:55.530]  Miss Americana.
[20:55.530 --> 20:56.010]  Miss Americana.
[20:56.930 --> 20:57.290]  19...
[20:57.290 --> 20:58.230]  Heartbreak Prince.
[20:58.330 --> 20:58.610]  There you go.
[21:00.730 --> 21:02.810]  2009 Donruss Americana cards.
[21:02.810 --> 21:04.410]  These were not easy to come by.
[21:04.490 --> 21:04.730]  Okay.
[21:05.130 --> 21:06.350]  And I have a lot of them.
[21:06.450 --> 21:06.710]  Oh.
[21:06.870 --> 21:07.190]  That's fine.
[21:07.190 --> 21:11.390]  One of those things where I bought more than I realized, I bought like 60 packs of these.
[21:11.390 --> 21:14.130]  Were these the ones that you thought were a different one and you bought a bunch?
[21:14.470 --> 21:14.790]  No.
[21:14.890 --> 21:15.110]  Okay.
[21:15.250 --> 21:16.190]  I knew what I was buying.
[21:16.230 --> 21:16.610]  Okay, cool.
[21:16.710 --> 21:22.030]  I just didn't realize that I had bid on a lot of different auctions at once, and then I
[21:22.030 --> 21:22.470]  won them all.
[21:23.350 --> 21:27.890]  So, what we have here is just like, you know, celebrity cards, you know, pop culture cards,
[21:28.870 --> 21:30.190]  but you know who's in this?
[21:30.210 --> 21:30.390]  Who?
[21:31.090 --> 21:31.450]  Uh...
[21:31.930 --> 21:33.010]  One Jackie Chan.
[21:33.290 --> 21:33.650]  Oh!
[21:34.030 --> 21:40.930]  Not only is Jackie Chan in here, you have a potential to hit a Jackie Chan relic or a
[21:40.930 --> 21:41.550]  Jackie Chan auto.
[21:41.730 --> 21:42.070]  What?
[21:42.350 --> 21:43.990]  So we are chasing Jackie Chans.
[21:44.350 --> 21:47.090]  Is this the pack that we opened one time that had like a shark in it?
[21:47.390 --> 21:48.150]  No, I don't think so.
[21:48.150 --> 21:48.970]  I don't think we've opened these yet.
[21:49.030 --> 21:49.610]  This is the first time.
[21:49.730 --> 21:50.330]  Those were...
[21:50.330 --> 21:51.430]  Those were weird.
[21:51.730 --> 21:53.270]  I have had these for a while.
[21:53.570 --> 21:56.290]  It was like a baseball player, the idea of flight, and a shark.
[21:57.450 --> 21:58.430]  That was a...
[21:58.430 --> 21:59.510]  That might have been...
[21:59.510 --> 22:00.590]  That had like the blimp or something.
[22:00.870 --> 22:00.950]  Yeah.
[22:01.050 --> 22:03.630]  Yeah, that might have been Alan and Ginter probably.
[22:04.510 --> 22:05.030]  All right, what do we got?
[22:05.130 --> 22:05.390]  All right.
[22:05.470 --> 22:06.210]  First card.
[22:06.330 --> 22:06.690]  Boom.
[22:06.830 --> 22:07.650]  Major celebrity.
[22:08.310 --> 22:09.110]  Sofia Milos.
[22:09.350 --> 22:09.570]  What?
[22:09.790 --> 22:10.550]  I don't know.
[22:11.570 --> 22:11.830]  Uh...
[22:11.830 --> 22:17.510]  Sofia Milos is best known for her role as Detective Yelena Salas in, uh, CSI Miami.
[22:17.770 --> 22:18.230]  Oh, okay.
[22:18.430 --> 22:18.630]  Yeah.
[22:18.710 --> 22:23.210]  She was also special agent Bianca Legarda in the Canadian crime drama, The Border.
[22:23.410 --> 22:24.530]  She likes to play, uh...
[22:24.530 --> 22:24.890]  The...
[22:24.890 --> 22:25.330]  Wait, hang on.
[22:25.350 --> 22:27.650]  The Canadian has a crime drama called The Border?
[22:27.670 --> 22:28.090]  The Border.
[22:28.090 --> 22:30.390]  Like the border from the U.S. to Canada?
[22:30.830 --> 22:31.350]  Oh, there's more.
[22:31.970 --> 22:36.190]  Uh, so Canadian crime drama, The Border, which follows immigration and customs security agents
[22:36.190 --> 22:39.650]  as they tackle such national security issues as terrorism and smuggling.
[22:40.070 --> 22:42.610]  How prudent in 2022.
[22:43.430 --> 22:43.690]  Wow.
[22:43.810 --> 22:44.130]  What?
[22:44.290 --> 22:44.570]  Crazy.
[22:44.770 --> 22:47.470]  You can't come across the border with all those.
[22:47.790 --> 22:48.610]  You gotta take them back.
[22:49.270 --> 22:49.750]  Sorry.
[22:49.970 --> 22:50.290]  Sorry.
[22:50.490 --> 22:51.010]  Take them back.
[22:51.130 --> 22:51.370]  Sorry.
[22:52.830 --> 22:54.790]  Everybody remembers Yancey Butler.
[22:55.170 --> 22:55.490]  Okay.
[22:55.550 --> 22:57.130]  From, uh...
[22:58.870 --> 23:02.090]  From playing the heroine in the Witchblade TV show.
[23:02.170 --> 23:02.570]  What?
[23:02.970 --> 23:03.650]  What did you just say?
[23:03.650 --> 23:04.790]  Is that another Canadian show?
[23:04.970 --> 23:05.290]  Is this American?
[23:06.130 --> 23:07.870]  Witchblade was a comic book.
[23:08.190 --> 23:09.250]  Her name is Yancey?
[23:09.330 --> 23:09.930]  Her name is Yancey.
[23:10.730 --> 23:13.450]  Yancey Butler, born July 2nd, 1970.
[23:14.330 --> 23:15.150]  Uh, she was also in the...
[23:15.150 --> 23:15.810]  Oh!

[23:21.990 --> 23:22.170]  Sorcerer.
[23:22.190 --> 23:23.570]  He could be making...
[23:23.570 --> 23:26.250]  I don't think he's quick-witted enough to make it up, but...
[23:26.250 --> 23:27.110]  I am, but I'm not.
[23:27.110 --> 23:27.650]  Yeah.
[23:27.870 --> 23:29.930]  I'm definitely quick-witted enough to do it, but I'm not making it up.
[23:30.270 --> 23:31.070]  Barry Watson.
[23:31.470 --> 23:31.810]  All right!
[23:31.830 --> 23:32.770]  I don't even need to read the back.
[23:32.870 --> 23:33.650]  We all remember...
[23:33.650 --> 23:34.290]  I'll look it up.

[23:52.930 --> 23:55.430]  Uh, this guy's name is Ron Polillo, and you might remember him from...
[23:55.430 --> 23:56.470]  Just like Jack Pattillo.
[23:57.010 --> 23:58.310]  Welcome back, Cotter!

[24:07.330 --> 24:07.450]  Yeah.
[24:07.490 --> 24:08.310]  With a rub of hose.
[24:08.490 --> 24:09.070]  That was a great show.
[24:09.230 --> 24:09.410]  Yeah.
[24:09.770 --> 24:11.670]  Oh, and then, boom...
[24:11.670 --> 24:12.310]  Uh...

[24:18.390 --> 24:18.610]  Wow.
[24:18.950 --> 24:19.550]  There you go, Corbin.
[24:19.650 --> 24:21.030]  No parallels, no hits.
[24:21.130 --> 24:21.290]  What?
[24:21.650 --> 24:22.510]  It's a box of Hoos.
[24:22.710 --> 24:23.410]  Box of...
[24:24.850 --> 24:25.350]  What's up?

[24:27.330 --> 24:27.670]  Uh-oh.
[24:27.750 --> 24:28.170]  Are we in trouble?
[24:28.350 --> 24:29.670]  No, Padre just hit a Grand Slam.
[24:30.250 --> 24:30.890]  Oh, really?
[24:30.990 --> 24:31.150]  Yeah.
[24:31.550 --> 24:31.910]  I wonder who...
[24:31.910 --> 24:33.630]  I wonder who was juiced enough to hit that.
[24:35.630 --> 24:36.550]  Oh, this is great.
[24:36.550 --> 24:37.550]  He had worms!
[24:38.590 --> 24:39.870]  I'm gonna save that one for last.
[24:40.010 --> 24:40.670]  That's the best.
[24:40.750 --> 24:41.210]  He's just...
[24:41.210 --> 24:42.050]  My excuse is...
[24:42.050 --> 24:44.710]  Listen, I was on the gas, and also, I have worms!
[24:47.110 --> 24:47.470]  Uh...
[24:47.970 --> 24:48.770]  I'm not even gonna bother.
[24:49.150 --> 24:49.390]  Uh...
[24:49.390 --> 24:50.030]  Eddie Burns.
[24:50.470 --> 24:50.930]  He's old.

[24:56.650 --> 24:58.090]  Yeah, he was born in 1930-something.
[24:58.250 --> 24:59.030]  He's old as dicks.
[24:59.190 --> 24:59.410]  All right.
[25:00.070 --> 25:00.430]  Uh...
[25:00.930 --> 25:01.650]  Lorna Luft.
[25:01.970 --> 25:02.310]  Luft.
[25:03.230 --> 25:04.450]  She was, uh...
[25:04.450 --> 25:04.670]  Who?
[25:05.190 --> 25:05.910]  She was in Grease 2.
[25:06.710 --> 25:07.990]  She was in Grease 2.
[25:08.110 --> 25:08.950]  Grease as well?
[25:09.050 --> 25:09.890]  Or Grease...
[25:09.890 --> 25:10.530]  The second one.
[25:11.910 --> 25:12.270]  Grease...
[25:12.270 --> 25:12.550]  2.
[25:12.790 --> 25:13.110]  The sequel.
[25:13.150 --> 25:14.670]  Wasn't it like Michelle Pfeiffer was saved in that?
[25:14.750 --> 25:14.870]  Yeah.
[25:15.450 --> 25:16.130]  Oh, man.
[25:16.210 --> 25:16.870]  Speaking of...
[25:17.290 --> 25:17.650]  Rip.
[25:17.930 --> 25:18.590]  Yeah, Rip.
[25:19.090 --> 25:20.110]  Do you think her...
[25:20.110 --> 25:20.810]  Olivia Newton-John died.
[25:20.950 --> 25:23.330]  Yeah, do you think her boyfriend's gonna come out of hiding now, or what?
[25:23.330 --> 25:23.950]  I don't think so.
[25:24.010 --> 25:24.870]  I think he hides forever.
[25:25.130 --> 25:25.250]  Yeah.
[25:25.590 --> 25:29.010]  Uh, Nadine Velasquez, you might remember from My Name is Earl.
[25:30.170 --> 25:31.310]  I never saw that show, but...
[25:31.310 --> 25:31.450]  Oh, yeah.

[25:37.970 --> 25:38.770]  Eric Roberts.
[25:39.390 --> 25:41.290]  Uh, supposedly...
[25:41.290 --> 25:41.570]  Uh-huh.
[25:42.390 --> 25:43.810]  ...really unlikable guy in person.
[25:43.930 --> 25:44.130]  Yeah.
[25:44.290 --> 25:44.690]  So...
[25:44.690 --> 25:46.910]  Uh, Julia Roberts' brother?
[25:47.190 --> 25:47.570]  Brother, yeah.
[25:47.710 --> 25:49.150]  And then, uh, Emma Roberts' dad?
[25:49.270 --> 25:49.830]  Yeah, I think so.
[25:49.830 --> 25:55.070]  For some reason, this week, and part of last week, I've had, like, six conversations about
[25:55.070 --> 25:56.890]  this guy on podcasts and stuff.
[25:56.910 --> 25:57.130]  Really?
[25:57.250 --> 25:57.730]  Fucking weird.
[25:58.070 --> 26:00.890]  Eric Roberts is interesting because he's been in 17,000 movies.
[26:00.990 --> 26:01.310]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[26:01.530 --> 26:02.930]  Including, uh, some good ones.
[26:03.110 --> 26:03.290]  Uh-huh.
[26:03.330 --> 26:04.050]  Like Pope of Greenwich Village.
[26:04.550 --> 26:04.870]  Uh...
[26:04.870 --> 26:05.530]  He was in Batman.
[26:05.670 --> 26:06.790]  He took my thumbs, Johnny!
[26:06.850 --> 26:07.390]  My thumbs!
[26:07.990 --> 26:08.950]  But, uh, anyway.
[26:09.350 --> 26:10.170]  Uh, there he is.
[26:10.330 --> 26:10.470]  He.
[26:10.850 --> 26:13.610]  I was thinking, we could do a podcast one day where we just watch Eric Roberts' movies.
[26:13.730 --> 26:14.030]  We could.
[26:14.070 --> 26:14.510]  Because there's so many.
[26:14.530 --> 26:16.610]  Yeah, we should, like, get through the stuff that we already have on the docket.
[26:16.670 --> 26:17.170]  Yeah, I agree.
[26:17.310 --> 26:18.450]  Eric Roberts and Joe Estevez.
[26:18.530 --> 26:19.410]  His name is just like yours.
[26:19.410 --> 26:20.750]  It's so close.
[26:20.750 --> 26:22.310]  And then...
[26:22.310 --> 26:22.850]  Ah!
[26:23.030 --> 26:23.550]  Debbie Mazar!
[26:24.290 --> 26:24.510]  Yay!
[26:25.370 --> 26:27.290]  Emily gets confused about who she is.
[26:27.390 --> 26:27.530]  Uh-huh.
[26:27.610 --> 26:27.770]  No.
[26:27.870 --> 26:28.210]  No.
[26:28.450 --> 26:28.590]  No.
[26:28.670 --> 26:29.390]  I correct you.
[26:29.710 --> 26:31.850]  This is Madonna's best friend, Debbie Mazar.
[26:31.890 --> 26:32.090]  Okay.
[26:32.210 --> 26:33.010]  She's, uh, you would...
[26:33.010 --> 26:33.910]  Y'all couldn't name her.
[26:34.150 --> 26:34.390]  Yeah.
[26:34.510 --> 26:34.950]  Oh, I don't.
[26:34.970 --> 26:35.510]  I couldn't.
[26:35.550 --> 26:36.350]  I couldn't name her.
[26:36.510 --> 26:37.170]  She was in...
[26:37.170 --> 26:37.970]  I would just go, oh, her.
[26:38.250 --> 26:40.070]  Wasn't she in something you guys were talking about, though?
[26:40.270 --> 26:40.650]  Yeah.
[26:40.830 --> 26:41.510]  What was it?
[26:41.850 --> 26:44.070]  Uh, she was in, uh, uh...
[26:44.070 --> 26:44.770]  Was she in the tuxedo?
[26:44.990 --> 26:47.750]  No, she was in, uh, she was in, uh, Anchorman.
[26:47.750 --> 26:48.350]  No.
[26:48.410 --> 26:48.730]  No.
[26:49.370 --> 26:51.250]  It was something you guys talked about on the podcast.
[26:51.570 --> 26:51.850]  I don't know.
[26:51.910 --> 26:52.490]  She's in Entourage.
[26:52.710 --> 26:52.910]  Yeah.
[26:52.990 --> 26:53.510]  She's in Entourage.
[26:53.790 --> 26:54.450]  Oh, yeah!
[26:54.890 --> 26:55.450]  Here we go.
[26:55.550 --> 26:56.130]  These are exciting.
[26:56.550 --> 26:57.850]  These are 501 originals.
[26:58.010 --> 26:59.390]  Uh, somebody sent these in to me.
[27:00.050 --> 27:00.770]  Uh, community...
[27:00.770 --> 27:01.530]  These are jean carts?
[27:01.890 --> 27:04.030]  Yeah, no, these are actually, um...
[27:04.030 --> 27:04.730]  Is it pants?
[27:04.910 --> 27:06.210]  It's like a 101 boyfriend cut.
[27:06.330 --> 27:06.610]  Yes!
[27:09.770 --> 27:10.130]  511s!
[27:10.390 --> 27:13.290]  I looked these up, because there's potentially some high-value cards in here.
[27:13.290 --> 27:13.570]  Really?
[27:13.730 --> 27:13.970]  Yeah.
[27:14.030 --> 27:14.610]  I think there's like a...
[27:14.610 --> 27:17.730]  If you find...
[27:17.730 --> 27:18.370]  It's over.
[27:20.650 --> 27:22.190]  So, let's see who we get.
[27:22.550 --> 27:22.910]  Who?
[27:23.010 --> 27:24.210]  What the fuck do you mean, who?
[27:25.070 --> 27:25.610]  Oh, you'll see.
[27:25.690 --> 27:26.750]  Here's someone in jeans.
[27:26.990 --> 27:27.650]  Here's like a...
[27:28.630 --> 27:28.950]  I don't know.
[27:29.090 --> 27:29.530]  Whatever that is.
[27:29.550 --> 27:29.770]  Primer card?
[27:29.950 --> 27:30.630]  Like, here's an idea.
[27:30.730 --> 27:31.210]  Here's what...
[27:31.210 --> 27:31.590]  It's a checklist.
[27:32.070 --> 27:33.610]  Pants can be things that aren't pants.
[27:33.790 --> 27:34.970]  Debbie Ferreira.
[27:34.970 --> 27:35.250]  Barbie.
[27:35.610 --> 27:35.970]  Ferreira.
[27:36.190 --> 27:37.050]  Barbie Fiera.
[27:37.330 --> 27:38.370]  What the fuck?
[27:38.410 --> 27:39.430]  Here's Emma Chamberlain.
[27:39.570 --> 27:40.170]  She's an actress.
[27:40.410 --> 27:40.610]  Yeah.
[27:40.970 --> 27:41.150]  Okay.
[27:41.310 --> 27:41.670]  Oh!
[27:42.230 --> 27:42.930]  Here's a big one.
[27:43.290 --> 27:43.770]  Oh, shit.
[27:43.870 --> 27:47.710]  We got...
[27:49.290 --> 27:49.650]  Justin Bieber.
[27:51.010 --> 27:52.310]  Justin Bieber's wife.
[27:53.030 --> 27:53.910]  She's also Baldwin.
[27:54.070 --> 27:54.670]  She's also Baldwin.
[27:54.770 --> 27:55.510]  She used to be Hailey Baldwin.
[27:55.630 --> 27:56.890]  She's Stephen Baldwin's daughter.
[27:56.910 --> 27:57.190]  Is she really?
[27:57.550 --> 27:57.670]  Yeah.
[27:57.790 --> 27:58.530]  Stephen Baldwin's daughter.
[27:58.530 --> 28:00.270]  Stephen Baldwin's daughter and Justin Bieber's wife.
[28:00.410 --> 28:00.790]  Oh, really?
[28:01.170 --> 28:02.190]  That might be worth something, though.
[28:02.310 --> 28:02.550]  Maybe not.
[28:03.670 --> 28:04.390]  Jaden Smith.
[28:05.290 --> 28:05.830]  What are...
[28:05.830 --> 28:07.890]  These are insane cards.
[28:08.070 --> 28:09.130]  I don't know who this is.
[28:09.250 --> 28:10.690]  Marcus Rashford.
[28:11.730 --> 28:14.410]  I don't like that the 90s look for pantses back.
[28:14.510 --> 28:15.350]  I think they look terrible.
[28:15.510 --> 28:16.110]  And then...
[28:16.110 --> 28:16.570]  Oh, here we go.
[28:16.830 --> 28:17.690]  Naomi Osaka.
[28:19.050 --> 28:19.790]  Is this sports?
[28:20.650 --> 28:21.410]  Sports, yeah.
[28:22.510 --> 28:23.310]  Like a...
[28:24.150 --> 28:26.790]  Light wash mom jean, I think is...
[28:26.790 --> 28:27.990]  You can be like, this is in.
[28:28.090 --> 28:28.890]  It's never gonna look good.
[28:29.550 --> 28:30.530]  I'm glad I didn't wear my pants today.
[28:30.590 --> 28:31.190]  Just saying.
[28:31.990 --> 28:32.390]  Sorry.
[28:32.930 --> 28:33.430]  Final card.
[28:33.710 --> 28:34.710]  Shai Gildas Alexander.
[28:34.830 --> 28:35.110]  Wow!
[28:35.590 --> 28:39.030]  Oklahoma City Thunder point guard or shooting guard, I believe.
[28:39.750 --> 28:40.150]  Fucking...
[28:40.150 --> 28:42.350]  Does it say or does it just have Gene Facts on the back?
[28:42.370 --> 28:43.010]  It has Gene Facts.
[28:43.030 --> 28:44.430]  It says...
[28:45.950 --> 28:47.610]  2021 Levi's 501 day.
[28:48.170 --> 28:48.810]  The original...
[28:48.810 --> 28:50.190]  Yeah, it doesn't even say what kind of jeans they are.
[28:50.550 --> 28:52.130]  He's like a 2940.
[28:53.390 --> 28:54.670]  But we've got two packs.
[28:54.930 --> 28:55.250]  Wow!
[28:55.670 --> 28:56.090]  We're gonna...
[28:56.090 --> 28:57.250]  You've never seen so many pants.
[28:57.450 --> 29:00.070]  I actually looked at buying these on eBay and they were too expensive.
[29:00.610 --> 29:00.910]  Really?
[29:01.010 --> 29:02.770]  So it was really awesome that somebody sent them to us.
[29:02.910 --> 29:02.950]  Yeah.
[29:02.950 --> 29:03.710]  Wow, this is a good send.
[29:04.030 --> 29:07.490]  I never would have thought pants would be good cards, but here we are.
[29:07.510 --> 29:07.670]  Oh, man.
[29:09.070 --> 29:09.630]  Very weird.
[29:09.670 --> 29:10.230]  Everybody loves Levi's.
[29:10.230 --> 29:11.790]  I thought that these were gonna be like old.
[29:11.850 --> 29:12.830]  Barbie Ferreira!
[29:13.250 --> 29:14.230]  Oh, is it the same cards?
[29:14.250 --> 29:14.810]  I think it's the same ones.
[29:14.830 --> 29:15.810]  These are all the same!
[29:15.990 --> 29:16.310]  Yay!
[29:17.330 --> 29:17.650]  Except...
[29:17.650 --> 29:18.410]  Boom!
[29:20.690 --> 29:21.650]  Numbered parallel.
[29:22.510 --> 29:23.470]  Marcus Rashford.
[29:24.010 --> 29:24.630]  Red parallel.
[29:25.030 --> 29:26.870]  Number 28 to 50.
[29:27.070 --> 29:28.270]  No, that's his pant size.
[29:28.530 --> 29:29.170]  28 to 50.
[29:29.610 --> 29:30.810]  28 waist, 50 length.
[29:31.190 --> 29:32.050]  It's like very tall.
[29:32.410 --> 29:33.310]  Very, very tall.
[29:34.370 --> 29:36.210]  I have this eBay listing for these cards.
[29:37.630 --> 29:38.110]  No!
[29:38.450 --> 29:38.570]  Yeah.
[29:38.990 --> 29:39.450]  What?
[29:40.430 --> 29:40.690]  I don't know.
[29:42.970 --> 29:43.450]  $750?!
[29:43.450 --> 29:46.070]  Well, that doesn't mean somebody paid that much for it, but that's what it's going for.
[29:46.410 --> 29:47.630]  Yeah, these cards, I'm telling you, man.
[29:47.630 --> 29:50.770]  I looked into buying some and they were, like, crazy expensive, which is why I was so
[29:50.770 --> 29:52.070]  blown away when somebody sent them to us.
[29:52.410 --> 29:52.770]  What?!
[29:52.770 --> 29:53.050]  Yeah.
[29:53.310 --> 29:53.530]  Yeah.
[29:53.690 --> 29:56.090]  But you just opened two packs and they're the same.
[29:56.590 --> 29:57.250]  They were, yeah.
[29:57.290 --> 29:59.210]  But this one had the red parallel in it.
[29:59.230 --> 30:01.190]  I bet if you got a Haley Bieber, that would be...
[30:01.190 --> 30:01.630]  Wow.
[30:01.910 --> 30:02.090]  Yeah.
[30:02.210 --> 30:02.890]  Or, like, an auto.
[30:03.290 --> 30:03.470]  Yeah.
[30:03.650 --> 30:04.010]  Ooh!
[30:04.550 --> 30:05.230]  No, it's...
[30:05.230 --> 30:05.670]  An on-jean auto.
[30:05.910 --> 30:07.090]  It's a relic.
[30:07.250 --> 30:08.210]  It's a part of the...
[30:08.210 --> 30:09.830]  They could've parked the jeans afterward.
[30:09.830 --> 30:10.950]  I would open more if I hadn't.
[30:10.950 --> 30:12.610]  The Logo Man is the Levi's tag.
[30:14.430 --> 30:16.230]  I'm blown away by those cards.
[30:16.490 --> 30:17.190]  Those are pretty good.
[30:17.450 --> 30:17.610]  Those are pretty good.
[30:17.610 --> 30:18.010]  Those are so cool.
[30:18.110 --> 30:18.790]  Thank you so much for sending those.
[30:18.870 --> 30:19.710]  We're about halfway through.
[30:19.830 --> 30:19.990]  Yep.
[30:20.050 --> 30:21.270]  Trying to figure out what we have time for.
[30:21.590 --> 30:22.470]  Oh, the clock right there.
[30:22.510 --> 30:22.710]  Right there, buddy.
[30:22.950 --> 30:25.030]  We gotta stop right at four today.
[30:25.270 --> 30:25.430]  You gotta.
[30:25.570 --> 30:27.230]  So, I wanna jump into something...
[30:27.230 --> 30:27.510]  Let's do it.
[30:27.530 --> 30:28.670]  ...that I got very recently.
[30:29.350 --> 30:31.570]  Last weekend was the Citywide Vintage Sale in Austin.
[30:31.570 --> 30:31.910]  Oh, that's right.
[30:32.050 --> 30:36.970]  And so Emily and I went out and checked it out at the event center and I was able to secure
[30:37.670 --> 30:40.550]  five packs of 1989 Fleer baseball.
[30:40.650 --> 30:41.990]  We have never opened this up.
[30:42.030 --> 30:42.590]  Very cool.
[30:43.050 --> 30:45.850]  Never opened this up on a break show before.
[30:46.450 --> 30:51.430]  The chase card here, if you don't know, is the Billy Ripken fuckface card.
[30:51.670 --> 30:51.810]  Yeah.
[30:52.110 --> 30:53.850]  There are five different versions of that card.
[30:54.010 --> 30:54.230]  Wow.
[30:54.330 --> 30:56.630]  There's a whiteout version, there's a white scribble, there's a black scribble, there's
[30:56.630 --> 30:58.570]  a black bar, and then there's the raw fuckface.
[30:59.130 --> 31:00.410]  And we only have the raw fuckface.
[31:00.550 --> 31:01.890]  It's actually not the rarest version.
[31:02.190 --> 31:02.470]  Really?
[31:02.530 --> 31:03.870]  I think the whiteout version is the rarest version.
[31:03.910 --> 31:04.030]  Huh.
[31:04.270 --> 31:04.910]  And goes for the most.
[31:04.930 --> 31:06.470]  So, let's open these up and see if we get lucky.
[31:06.590 --> 31:08.270]  How much were each of these packs?
[31:08.970 --> 31:09.290]  $3?
[31:09.370 --> 31:10.550]  I think $4, $3.50?
[31:10.790 --> 31:11.050]  Oh, yeah?
[31:11.150 --> 31:12.110]  A pack, I think, yeah.
[31:12.530 --> 31:16.690]  Do you think that finding a fuckface card in the wild is more exciting than finding a
[31:16.690 --> 31:17.410]  Zimmer in the wild?
[31:18.310 --> 31:19.810]  I think they're equal.
[31:20.190 --> 31:20.430]  Yeah?
[31:20.450 --> 31:21.010]  I think they're equal.
[31:21.170 --> 31:22.590]  I think I would be equally excited.
[31:24.210 --> 31:24.930]  David Cohn.
[31:25.030 --> 31:25.910]  What is this?
[31:26.090 --> 31:26.590]  Oh, these are stickers.
[31:26.890 --> 31:27.050]  Sorry.
[31:27.230 --> 31:28.750]  No, but I mean, like, they're...
[31:28.750 --> 31:29.550]  National League stickers.
[31:30.310 --> 31:30.910]  Is it...
[31:30.910 --> 31:31.430]  Stickers?
[31:31.450 --> 31:33.110]  But, like, is it the East?
[31:34.050 --> 31:34.310]  Like, what?
[31:34.330 --> 31:34.690]  Stick to things?
[31:35.210 --> 31:36.870]  No, but I'm just saying, like, it's Dodgers.
[31:36.970 --> 31:37.170]  Great.
[31:37.370 --> 31:37.870]  It's National League.
[31:38.930 --> 31:39.650]  But Expo's...
[31:39.650 --> 31:40.870]  Philly's Mets are all...
[31:41.490 --> 31:41.850]  East.
[31:42.230 --> 31:43.210]  Why are Dodgers on there?
[31:43.350 --> 31:43.790]  It's baseball.
[31:44.450 --> 31:44.810]  This sucks.
[31:44.810 --> 31:45.310]  I think it's random.
[31:45.470 --> 31:45.890]  I think...
[31:45.890 --> 31:47.570]  I hate old baseball stuff like that.
[31:47.750 --> 31:49.670]  They just, like, there's no rhyme or reason to any of it.
[31:49.770 --> 31:50.290]  I fucking hate it.
[31:50.670 --> 31:51.810]  Eric is not amused.
[31:51.930 --> 31:58.670]  Mike Berbeck, Geoff Montgomery, Sid Fernandez, John Farrell, Cal Daniels, Lance Johnson.
[31:58.950 --> 32:00.650]  I figure if I, like, build my voice a little shit now...
[32:00.650 --> 32:01.050]  I like it.
[32:01.130 --> 32:01.850]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:02.110 --> 32:03.490]  I'm enticing the card up.
[32:03.490 --> 32:03.630]  Yeah, it's exciting.
[32:05.230 --> 32:12.930]  Mike Krukow, Dennis Lamb, Vance Lott, Dan Plezak, Dan Petri, Glenn Larkin, Darren Jackson, and...
[32:12.930 --> 32:13.530]  No, Jack Morrison.
[32:13.930 --> 32:14.890]  Okay, we're close.
[32:15.050 --> 32:16.110]  Dan Plezak, that's cool.
[32:16.710 --> 32:16.750]  Yeah.
[32:17.330 --> 32:17.910]  His kid pitches.
[32:18.150 --> 32:18.670]  I think it's his kid.
[32:18.850 --> 32:19.090]  Does he?
[32:19.230 --> 32:22.310]  Yeah, pitches for the Guardians, I think.
[32:22.750 --> 32:22.970]  Huh.
[32:23.390 --> 32:23.670]  Nice.
[32:23.830 --> 32:24.690]  You learn something new every day.
[32:24.850 --> 32:25.030]  Yep.
[32:25.450 --> 32:26.550]  Except for those days you don't.
[32:26.590 --> 32:26.770]  Yeah.
[32:27.050 --> 32:27.830]  Which are most days for me.
[32:27.870 --> 32:28.310]  Here you go.
[32:28.570 --> 32:29.710]  This is the Eric...
[32:29.710 --> 32:30.210]  Oh, wow, what's that?
[32:30.250 --> 32:30.730]  Is that a sticker?
[32:30.730 --> 32:31.910]  Yeah, that's a...
[32:31.910 --> 32:32.650]  This is a...
[32:32.650 --> 32:33.410]  Yeah, it's a baseball sticker.
[32:33.590 --> 32:33.650]  Yeah.
[32:33.870 --> 32:35.670]  Bend and Peel, National League, Western Division.
[32:35.770 --> 32:36.290]  That's right, baby.
[32:36.490 --> 32:36.850]  There you go.
[32:37.170 --> 32:38.430]  It's the 80s logo.
[32:38.550 --> 32:38.890]  It's a good one.
[32:39.230 --> 32:39.810]  Oh, boy.
[32:39.850 --> 32:40.490]  Here we go.
[32:41.210 --> 32:43.590]  Kelly Gruber, Eric Plonk.
[32:43.850 --> 32:44.170]  Plonk.
[32:44.190 --> 32:44.550]  Eric Plonk.
[32:44.550 --> 32:44.950]  That's a good one.
[32:44.950 --> 32:45.510]  That's a good one.
[32:45.750 --> 32:45.810]  Yeah.
[32:45.990 --> 32:46.390]  Well, that's terrific.
[32:46.390 --> 32:47.210]  Vaughn Hayes.
[32:47.470 --> 32:47.870]  Plonk.
[32:50.030 --> 32:53.850]  Mark Eckhorn, Junior Ortiz, Geoff Reardon.
[32:54.750 --> 32:55.150]  Grrrr.
[32:55.210 --> 32:55.850]  The World Organizer.
[32:56.330 --> 32:56.490]  Yeah.
[32:56.610 --> 32:58.630]  And Dave LaPointe.
[32:59.090 --> 32:59.490]  Jay...
[33:00.090 --> 33:00.710]  What's wrong with that?
[33:00.710 --> 33:01.590]  What's wrong with that Oral guy?
[33:02.110 --> 33:02.390]  Oral...
[33:02.930 --> 33:03.250]  He...
[33:04.110 --> 33:04.430]  He...
[33:04.430 --> 33:06.450]  He beat my Oakland A's when I was a kid.
[33:06.570 --> 33:06.630]  Yeah.
[33:06.630 --> 33:07.410]  I was a big Bart McGuire fan.
[33:07.510 --> 33:08.650]  Yeah, he was a...
[33:08.650 --> 33:09.230]  He was a menace.
[33:09.730 --> 33:10.310]  Phenomenal pitcher.
[33:10.390 --> 33:10.550]  Yeah.
[33:10.570 --> 33:10.930]  He's a...
[33:10.930 --> 33:11.170]  He's a...
[33:11.170 --> 33:11.350]  He's a...
[33:11.350 --> 33:12.550]  Color man now, yeah, for the Dodgers.
[33:12.550 --> 33:13.290]  He's an announcer for the Dodgers.
[33:13.310 --> 33:14.630]  And I'm a Dodgers fan now, but I just...
[33:14.630 --> 33:15.210]  I hate Oral Hershel.
[33:16.290 --> 33:16.930]  Jay Buhner...
[33:16.930 --> 33:17.310]  I'm a Dodgers fan now.
[33:17.450 --> 33:17.890]  Very cool.
[33:18.690 --> 33:19.570]  That's the best photo they had.
[33:20.150 --> 33:20.470]  That...
[33:20.470 --> 33:21.010]  I mean...
[33:21.010 --> 33:22.450]  They said, should we color correct this?
[33:22.450 --> 33:23.870]  And they said, it's 1988.
[33:23.930 --> 33:24.790]  What is that?
[33:24.790 --> 33:26.570]  Jay Buhner played for so long.
[33:26.650 --> 33:27.650]  He had so many more cards.
[33:27.750 --> 33:28.530]  They just went, this is fine.
[33:28.590 --> 33:29.230]  This guy's sticking around.
[33:29.390 --> 33:30.550]  Faced directly into the sunlight.
[33:30.610 --> 33:30.690]  Yeah.
[33:30.850 --> 33:31.450]  I'm going to save that.
[33:32.270 --> 33:33.610]  Do you want to get the bounce board?
[33:33.770 --> 33:33.990]  No.
[33:34.830 --> 33:42.290]  Tom Bernanski, Todd Benzinger, Steve Lyons, Ron Robinson, John Dobson.
[33:42.470 --> 33:42.770]  Nothing bad.
[33:42.770 --> 33:44.770]  Man, I hope we don't strike out.
[33:45.010 --> 33:45.490]  I really want to hit it.
[33:45.490 --> 33:46.190]  Oh, baseball, baby.
[33:46.610 --> 33:47.410]  Oh, that's funny.
[33:47.450 --> 33:48.290]  I didn't make that connection.
[33:49.230 --> 33:49.490]  What?
[33:49.590 --> 33:50.750]  Okay, I don't know what this sound is.
[33:50.810 --> 33:51.170]  I just want to know.
[33:51.770 --> 33:53.130]  Oh, my dick's wet.
[33:53.450 --> 33:53.810]  I know.
[33:55.030 --> 33:55.470]  That's new.
[33:55.590 --> 33:56.330]  That sounded like Kerry.
[33:56.850 --> 33:57.570]  There you go.
[33:57.690 --> 34:05.990]  Mets, sticker, Mario Diaz, Scott Geraltz, Steve Searcy, Tim Leary.
[34:06.090 --> 34:06.650]  A little more down.
[34:06.770 --> 34:07.150]  There you go.
[34:08.950 --> 34:12.150]  Oswaldo Pereza, Bob Pepper.
[34:12.890 --> 34:14.130]  Oh, that's a mustache.
[34:14.890 --> 34:15.350]  That's like a mustache.
[34:15.350 --> 34:17.630]  Bash brother, Jose Canseco.
[34:18.610 --> 34:20.190]  That biggest dude with the littlest balls.
[34:20.270 --> 34:21.130]  We'll save that.
[34:21.250 --> 34:21.330]  That's a hit.
[34:21.330 --> 34:22.850]  He's just like the Padres guy, right?
[34:22.850 --> 34:23.790]  Not like him.
[34:23.870 --> 34:24.510]  He didn't have worms.
[34:24.730 --> 34:26.110]  This is a different worm situation.
[34:26.370 --> 34:26.570]  Different worms.
[34:26.670 --> 34:27.790]  My team has no worms.
[34:27.990 --> 34:29.450]  We're a wormless team, guys.
[34:29.970 --> 34:32.110]  We wouldn't even have a little worms now.
[34:32.310 --> 34:35.630]  Geoff Pico, Roberto Kelly.
[34:35.890 --> 34:36.470]  He's a good player.
[34:36.850 --> 34:41.450]  Ricky Jordan, Oda B. McDowell, rather.
[34:41.610 --> 34:42.110]  Read it upside down.
[34:42.130 --> 34:42.810]  That's another great name.
[34:43.770 --> 34:44.270]  Oh, shit.
[34:44.610 --> 34:45.450]  This might be...
[34:45.450 --> 34:46.590]  Would you...
[34:46.590 --> 34:47.230]  You want me to look it up?
[34:47.950 --> 34:49.470]  No, that's not a rookie, but Tom Glavine.
[34:49.570 --> 34:49.910]  You got it.
[34:50.730 --> 34:51.650]  That's like Gavin's name.
[34:51.650 --> 34:52.530]  It is.
[34:53.250 --> 34:53.930]  Tom Gavin.
[34:54.370 --> 34:55.130]  Tom Gavin.
[34:55.670 --> 34:58.730]  Jose Canseco, Terry Steinbach, and Mark McGuire, triple A's.
[34:59.070 --> 35:02.650]  If I'm not mistaken, all three of those guys were Rookie of the Year.
[35:03.210 --> 35:04.750]  Was Terry Steinbach Rookie of the Year?
[35:04.850 --> 35:05.250]  I don't know.
[35:05.250 --> 35:06.330]  I think that might be the point of this.
[35:08.650 --> 35:10.070]  Anyway, I'm right on the rolls.
[35:10.130 --> 35:10.630]  Did Mark McGuire have worms?
[35:11.550 --> 35:13.150]  No, he was just doing steroids.
[35:13.410 --> 35:14.670]  No, he just...
[35:14.670 --> 35:15.410]  It's different.
[35:15.730 --> 35:16.630]  I can see how you get confused.
[35:16.810 --> 35:17.390]  It's different.
[35:17.770 --> 35:18.250]  Danny Cox.
[35:18.370 --> 35:19.850]  And then, you don't see this one every day.
[35:20.670 --> 35:21.890]  You know him, you love him.
[35:22.190 --> 35:23.110]  We work with him all the time.
[35:23.370 --> 35:24.030]  Louis Medina.
[35:25.550 --> 35:27.830]  Okay, so we have to have a people we know pile.
[35:28.430 --> 35:29.130]  People we know pile.
[35:30.090 --> 35:31.610]  People who work at Rooster Teeth Pile.
[35:32.430 --> 35:33.390]  How wild is that?
[35:33.750 --> 35:35.190]  That's fucking great.
[35:35.310 --> 35:35.770]  That's awesome.
[35:35.830 --> 35:36.590]  Can we open it back?
[35:36.830 --> 35:37.710]  Jordan Levin.
[35:41.770 --> 35:43.950]  Like, that's not even like a common name.
[35:44.030 --> 35:46.230]  Like, it's not like a Michael Jones, you know what I mean?
[35:46.310 --> 35:49.390]  Like, you figure that would be like, oh, okay, that's a pretty common name.
[35:49.390 --> 35:49.890]  Louis Medina?
[35:50.190 --> 35:51.030]  No, not really common.
[35:51.330 --> 35:56.090]  There's a good chance someday I'll be a Michigan native if I ever move from Austin.
[35:56.250 --> 35:56.950]  I might move to Detroit.
[35:57.110 --> 35:57.850]  Kind of like that area.
[35:58.390 --> 36:00.110]  What I won't be is a Tigers fan.
[36:00.170 --> 36:02.090]  I will say, that's their best logo.
[36:02.410 --> 36:04.190]  Insane Tiger is their best...
[36:04.190 --> 36:06.230]  Like, look at his fucking...
[36:06.890 --> 36:07.970]  Like, he's excited.
[36:08.130 --> 36:08.390]  Robin.
[36:08.890 --> 36:10.590]  Here's the problem with the Tigers.
[36:10.830 --> 36:12.270]  I mean, other than they suck and stuff.
[36:12.450 --> 36:14.350]  I grew up a White Sox fan.
[36:14.350 --> 36:18.930]  Therefore, the Tigers and the Twins can burn in hell for all I care.
[36:19.110 --> 36:20.630]  I can never support either of those.
[36:20.830 --> 36:21.470]  I'm with you.
[36:21.530 --> 36:22.310]  That's how I feel about the Dodgers.
[36:22.430 --> 36:24.710]  But love will make you do crazy things.
[36:24.790 --> 36:27.430]  And I may move to Detroit someday, but it won't make me like that team.
[36:27.590 --> 36:30.230]  I'll go watch the Dodgers and the White Sox play them.
[36:30.290 --> 36:31.450]  We've got Celtics and Lakers.
[36:32.550 --> 36:33.070]  What about that?
[36:33.310 --> 36:34.510]  Like, you appreciate the Lakers.
[36:34.690 --> 36:35.870]  I don't appreciate the Lakers at all.
[36:36.470 --> 36:37.790]  I wish they would also burn in hell.
[36:37.810 --> 36:40.030]  You're kind to my dad when he talks about them.
[36:40.110 --> 36:42.230]  I'm very kind to your dad, because I love your dad.
[36:42.950 --> 36:44.450]  And I respect your dad.
[36:44.990 --> 36:45.950]  Hey, fucker!
[36:47.230 --> 36:49.290]  I like the Dodgers. I'm supporting the Dodgers.
[36:49.390 --> 36:51.510]  I never gave a shit about the Dodgers until I met your dad.
[36:51.650 --> 36:52.710]  That is all your dad.
[36:53.030 --> 36:55.310]  Alfredo Griffin, Bobby Witt.
[36:56.090 --> 36:57.050]  That's a big name.
[36:57.430 --> 36:58.750]  Nelson Santovena.
[36:59.690 --> 37:02.050]  Kevin Seitzer, Pedro Guerrero.
[37:02.610 --> 37:03.230]  Oh, that's...
[37:05.950 --> 37:07.810]  Joel Skinner, not the prettiest photo.
[37:09.370 --> 37:10.330]  What happened?
[37:11.050 --> 37:12.970]  Oh, shit. Can we look up if this is...
[37:12.970 --> 37:14.150]  Oh, it's not. Damn it.
[37:14.450 --> 37:15.450]  We got the Randy Johnson.
[37:15.850 --> 37:17.390]  A, it's a good card, because it's Randy Johnson.
[37:17.990 --> 37:20.170]  It might be his rookie card or his second-year card.
[37:20.390 --> 37:21.650]  But this is blacked out.
[37:21.910 --> 37:24.310]  This is an even rarer error than the...
[37:24.310 --> 37:25.150]  What is it?
[37:25.150 --> 37:26.050]  ...than the Billy Ripken card.
[37:26.610 --> 37:29.190]  That's a Budweiser sign or Marlboro.
[37:29.350 --> 37:30.530]  So you can see Coke right there.
[37:30.730 --> 37:32.110]  There was, like, a big cigarette ad.
[37:32.150 --> 37:34.110]  It was Marlboro or Budweiser, and they blacked it out.
[37:34.170 --> 37:38.950]  And so that is actually a pretty valuable error, if you can get the one with the cigarette ad on it.
[37:38.950 --> 37:39.890]  Oh, that's crazy.
[37:39.970 --> 37:41.590]  That's great. And then, plus, it's, you know, the big unit.
[37:42.830 --> 37:45.690]  Mark McCaskill, George Bell.
[37:45.750 --> 37:47.050]  You know, they didn't call him that because he was tall.
[37:48.390 --> 37:48.830]  The big unit.
[37:49.470 --> 37:50.350]  They called him that because he had a...
[37:50.350 --> 37:51.110]  Yeah, got it, man.
[37:51.150 --> 37:51.450]  ...giant dick.
[37:52.370 --> 37:53.090]  Doug Jennings.
[37:55.670 --> 37:59.270]  It's the saddest or the best photo of Tommy Gregg.
[38:00.710 --> 38:01.430]  Oh, man.
[38:02.090 --> 38:03.210]  Well, first off...
[38:03.210 --> 38:07.410]  First off, we need a section for Gus Unibrow people.
[38:07.410 --> 38:09.410]  Yeah, we're saving this one.
[38:09.410 --> 38:09.750]  He's a bit of Cirolla.
[38:10.070 --> 38:10.850]  He is...
[38:10.850 --> 38:11.970]  And then, also...
[38:11.970 --> 38:15.730]  He's got, like, a whole... He's just all, like, cave-manned out.
[38:15.930 --> 38:16.170]  Yeah.
[38:16.890 --> 38:18.230]  He's all brow, dude.
[38:18.350 --> 38:19.910]  His head's kind of the shape of a thumb, too.
[38:19.910 --> 38:22.150]  The push-in is so good.
[38:22.470 --> 38:23.230]  Look at that.
[38:23.690 --> 38:24.870]  Oh, no.
[38:25.110 --> 38:27.490]  That's rough stuff.
[38:28.010 --> 38:28.690]  We're definitely saving that.
[38:28.690 --> 38:29.150]  Sorry, bud.
[38:29.190 --> 38:29.690]  That's a good one.
[38:30.790 --> 38:34.830]  Pat Borders, Jose Lind, Kirby Puckett.
[38:34.930 --> 38:35.290]  Yeah.
[38:35.490 --> 38:36.170]  Love Kirby Puckett.
[38:36.170 --> 38:37.370]  And then, Frank Viola.
[38:37.670 --> 38:38.690]  I thought you couldn't support the twins.
[38:39.150 --> 38:40.090]  I like Kirby Puckett.
[38:40.190 --> 38:40.890]  I don't like the twins.
[38:41.030 --> 38:41.450]  Kirby Puckett...
[38:41.450 --> 38:43.010]  Who disliked Kirby Puckett?
[38:43.570 --> 38:44.590]  That's a good name.
[38:44.690 --> 38:45.230]  Kirby Puckett.
[38:45.290 --> 38:45.430]  Yeah.
[38:46.090 --> 38:46.650]  Fun to say.
[38:46.890 --> 38:47.710]  Growing up, it was...
[38:47.710 --> 38:48.130]  You know what I say?
[38:48.590 --> 38:48.990]  Puckett.
[38:49.950 --> 38:51.430]  I was just saying Kirby's name.
[38:51.950 --> 38:52.670]  Hanging on to it, huh?
[38:52.770 --> 38:53.030]  Yeah.
[38:53.110 --> 38:53.790]  That's a good name.
[38:54.070 --> 38:54.430]  Emily's right.
[38:55.050 --> 38:55.730]  Here we go.
[38:57.030 --> 38:57.430]  Indians...
[38:57.430 --> 38:58.850]  Guardians, now.
[38:59.070 --> 38:59.270]  Yeah.
[38:59.490 --> 39:00.030]  Now, the Guardians.
[39:00.350 --> 39:01.670]  Thank you for the progress.
[39:02.210 --> 39:02.870]  Put that right there.
[39:03.170 --> 39:04.890]  Roberto Alomar, who's a great player.
[39:04.890 --> 39:07.450]  Was his brother Sandy Alomar?
[39:07.770 --> 39:08.470]  I don't know.
[39:08.550 --> 39:09.230]  I think so.
[39:09.450 --> 39:12.810]  I think it might be one of those, like, common last name things.
[39:12.990 --> 39:13.890]  These two dudes...
[39:14.610 --> 39:15.070]  Brian Holton...
[39:16.370 --> 39:17.330]  Curtis Wilkerson...
[39:17.330 --> 39:17.990]  Hubie Brooks...
[39:18.750 --> 39:19.710]  Brett Saberhagen.
[39:19.970 --> 39:20.290]  Nice.
[39:20.470 --> 39:21.410]  That's a good one.
[39:21.410 --> 39:22.030]  Brett Saberhagen was a great dude.
[39:22.110 --> 39:23.390]  Saberhagen's very good.
[39:23.650 --> 39:26.810]  Two more dudes...
[39:28.560 --> 39:30.140]  I've never heard this name before.
[39:30.480 --> 39:31.660]  Dale Mohorkic.
[39:32.940 --> 39:33.660]  Why is he pissed?
[39:33.660 --> 39:34.220]  Save that one.
[39:34.700 --> 39:35.520]  Why is he pissed?
[39:35.520 --> 39:36.880]  Because his last name is Mohorkic.
[39:37.680 --> 39:38.640]  That's why he's pissed.
[39:38.960 --> 39:39.640]  Oh, boy.
[39:39.640 --> 39:41.960]  It's like, I gotta play the Yankees, but I got this on the back of my fucking shirt.
[39:44.380 --> 39:45.440]  There's another shitty name.
[39:45.720 --> 39:46.460]  Jim Pankovic.
[39:48.280 --> 39:48.720]  Great.
[39:48.980 --> 39:57.340]  Brian Harvey, Tony Fernandez, Curt Young, Marvin Freeman, Todd Stottlemyre, and John Smiley.
[39:57.640 --> 39:58.300]  We struck out.
[39:58.300 --> 39:58.680]  Didn't get them, huh?
[39:58.820 --> 39:59.060]  Yeah.
[40:00.240 --> 40:01.120]  We whiffed.
[40:01.460 --> 40:03.100]  We found a couple of good ones.
[40:03.140 --> 40:03.840]  We got some decent ones in there.
[40:03.860 --> 40:05.320]  Let's move on to something else.
[40:05.320 --> 40:05.660]  All right.
[40:05.760 --> 40:06.220]  What else we got?
[40:06.320 --> 40:06.960]  Some fun stuff.
[40:06.960 --> 40:08.500]  This is your curated playlist or whatever.
[40:08.780 --> 40:09.520]  Yeah, it's cool stuff.
[40:09.620 --> 40:09.920]  What's fun?
[40:10.180 --> 40:11.080]  What do we got in here?
[40:11.240 --> 40:12.660]  Let's get away from sports for a minute.
[40:12.820 --> 40:13.000]  Okay.
[40:13.920 --> 40:14.200]  Oh, yeah.
[40:14.220 --> 40:14.880]  We'll get away from sports.
[40:14.940 --> 40:15.440]  Here's some wrestling.
[40:15.880 --> 40:16.500]  All right.
[40:17.380 --> 40:17.740]  WWE?
[40:18.280 --> 40:18.440]  Yeah.
[40:18.880 --> 40:19.240]  SummerSlam?
[40:19.620 --> 40:19.980]  SummerSlam.
[40:20.140 --> 40:22.540]  I bought just this one pack.
[40:22.660 --> 40:22.820]  Yeah.
[40:24.520 --> 40:27.340]  2019 Tops WWE SummerSlam.
[40:30.520 --> 40:32.120]  Are you familiar with Bayley?
[40:32.120 --> 40:35.060]  She just came back from, like, a two-year, I think, leg injury.
[40:35.420 --> 40:35.800]  Oh, really?
[40:35.880 --> 40:36.460]  So she's back.
[40:36.660 --> 40:36.800]  Yeah.
[40:36.900 --> 40:38.440]  So that might have been the last time she wrestled was in the start zone.
[40:38.980 --> 40:39.360]  Probably.
[40:39.720 --> 40:40.120]  Poor Bayley.
[40:40.240 --> 40:42.320]  But she's back and she's great.
[40:42.640 --> 40:43.080]  Bayley's great.
[40:43.300 --> 40:43.980]  Liv Morgan.
[40:44.160 --> 40:48.760]  She's the current Women's Champion and tweets with Fiona all the time.
[40:49.080 --> 40:49.620]  Are Fiona?
[40:49.780 --> 40:49.960]  Yeah.
[40:50.300 --> 40:50.720]  Isn't that crazy?
[40:51.200 --> 40:51.580]  Yeah.
[40:51.760 --> 40:52.500]  Are they buddies?
[40:52.700 --> 40:53.320]  Yeah, I think so.
[40:53.360 --> 40:53.540]  Wow.
[40:53.740 --> 40:54.460]  Small world.
[40:54.600 --> 40:55.100]  Weird world.
[40:55.280 --> 40:57.720]  The Miz, that's the reality TV dude.
[40:57.760 --> 40:58.080]  Yeah.
[40:58.240 --> 40:59.560]  Did you see the thing about him?
[40:59.560 --> 41:01.720]  The Woodstock documentary that just came out?
[41:01.880 --> 41:02.880]  We watched the first two episodes.
[41:03.040 --> 41:09.620]  There's, like, there's, like, a shot of him at the, like, it's like, yeah, and then it all goes crazy and then it, like, cuts to him going...
[41:10.540 --> 41:11.340]  It's fucking great.
[41:11.720 --> 41:12.380]  In, like, 99.
[41:12.500 --> 41:13.140]  So he's just, like, there.
[41:13.200 --> 41:13.620]  He's just a guy.
[41:14.360 --> 41:16.480]  Look at all the problematic white men down there.
[41:17.160 --> 41:17.480]  Fascinating.
[41:17.560 --> 41:18.260]  And now he's a pro wrestler.
[41:18.560 --> 41:19.440]  Fucked up documentary.
[41:20.440 --> 41:21.080]  Becky Lynch.
[41:21.180 --> 41:21.860]  Oh, the man.
[41:21.960 --> 41:22.480]  The man.
[41:22.560 --> 41:23.180]  I love Becky Lynch.
[41:23.980 --> 41:26.340]  She just separated her shoulder and then wrestled, like, 12 more minutes.
[41:26.420 --> 41:27.340]  It was fucked up.
[41:27.540 --> 41:28.680]  That's why she's the man.
[41:28.680 --> 41:28.800]  Yeah.
[41:29.060 --> 41:31.340]  Geoff Hardy wrestles Jinder Mahal.
[41:31.420 --> 41:31.660]  Alright.
[41:31.820 --> 41:32.540]  You all remember that.
[41:32.760 --> 41:33.900]  Geoff Hardy just got another...
[41:33.900 --> 41:34.060]  Another thing.
[41:34.060 --> 41:35.560]  Geoff Hardy rehab-a-thing.
[41:35.680 --> 41:35.980]  No, no, no.
[41:36.380 --> 41:37.120]  Fucking another thing.
[41:37.700 --> 41:41.180]  Uh, Baron Corbin and Dr. Finn Baylor do a thing.
[41:41.360 --> 41:41.840]  Doctor?
[41:42.200 --> 41:42.620]  Doctor.
[41:43.040 --> 41:44.200]  Where'd you get doctor?
[41:44.340 --> 41:46.040]  Oh, defeats Finn Baylor.
[41:46.180 --> 41:46.360]  Defeats?
[41:46.380 --> 41:46.820]  I don't know.
[41:46.860 --> 41:47.740]  I'm reading the shit upside down.
[41:48.320 --> 41:51.820]  Samoa Joe, uh, defeats AJ Styles.
[41:51.880 --> 41:52.220]  Right.
[41:52.920 --> 41:54.180]  Uh, then this thing.
[41:54.800 --> 41:55.300]  Oh, here we go.
[41:55.540 --> 41:56.880]  Here's Mandy Rose.
[41:57.000 --> 41:57.200]  Alright.
[41:57.200 --> 41:59.100]  Current NXT Women's Champion.
[41:59.440 --> 42:00.280]  Daniel Bryan.
[42:00.680 --> 42:01.160]  Current...
[42:01.160 --> 42:03.040]  Uh, he's wrestling tonight on AEW.
[42:03.240 --> 42:04.240]  Uh, Bryan Danielson.
[42:04.460 --> 42:05.360]  Alexa Bliss.
[42:05.660 --> 42:05.940]  Bliss.
[42:06.340 --> 42:06.680]  Bliss.
[42:07.920 --> 42:08.640]  Alright, she's on Raw.
[42:08.800 --> 42:08.980]  I don't know.
[42:09.020 --> 42:09.780]  A dick snippet on the brain.
[42:09.840 --> 42:10.160]  It's good.
[42:10.540 --> 42:12.720]  Uh, oh yeah, you mentioned this guy sometime.
[42:13.000 --> 42:13.720]  Roman Reigns.
[42:13.760 --> 42:14.480]  Yeah, he's...
[42:14.480 --> 42:15.760]  He's like the guy.
[42:15.940 --> 42:17.380]  He is there the guy.
[42:17.820 --> 42:18.940]  He's like the champion.
[42:19.160 --> 42:19.680]  Beats everyone.
[42:20.320 --> 42:23.400]  He's gonna wrestle The Rock, uh, at WrestleMania next year.
[42:23.560 --> 42:23.940]  What?
[42:23.960 --> 42:24.220]  Really?
[42:24.320 --> 42:24.520]  That's the rumor.
[42:24.520 --> 42:25.060]  It's his cousin.
[42:25.200 --> 42:26.220]  Here's the fucking...
[42:26.220 --> 42:26.940]  Oh, is that 92 Undertaker?
[42:26.940 --> 42:28.000]  Here's the Undertaker, yeah.
[42:28.160 --> 42:31.380]  I didn't realize how stupid the cut on his shirt sleeve is.
[42:31.400 --> 42:32.520]  Oh, it's so lame.
[42:32.620 --> 42:33.280]  He wore...
[42:33.280 --> 42:34.620]  He had like a little tie.
[42:34.820 --> 42:38.740]  Like, everything about original Undertaker's presentation, it's like a miracle that he made it.
[42:38.840 --> 42:39.440]  It's bad.
[42:40.840 --> 42:41.560]  These dudes.
[42:41.820 --> 42:42.420]  Edge and Christian.
[42:42.580 --> 42:44.480]  They totally wreak havoc about some of these guys.
[42:44.660 --> 42:46.760]  This is exciting, because Emily and I are now...
[42:46.760 --> 42:47.380]  We're big...
[42:47.380 --> 42:49.300]  We're big time into UFC now, right?
[42:49.320 --> 42:49.480]  Okay.
[42:49.520 --> 42:50.160]  Watch a lot of UFC.
[42:50.840 --> 42:52.220]  Here's Ronda Rousey.
[42:52.260 --> 42:52.540]  Yeah, yeah.
[42:52.640 --> 42:53.440]  Rowdy Ronda Rousey.
[42:53.440 --> 42:54.580]  Yeah, she wrestles in WWE.
[42:54.600 --> 42:55.480]  Is she still wrestling?
[42:55.780 --> 42:56.280]  That's cool.
[42:56.440 --> 42:57.520]  Is she still Rowdy?
[42:57.640 --> 42:58.360]  Is she still doing the...
[42:58.360 --> 42:58.640]  That's cool.
[42:58.880 --> 43:01.140]  If she comes out to bad reputation and everything, it's okay.
[43:01.160 --> 43:03.000]  How did Rowdy Roddy Piper feel about that?
[43:03.360 --> 43:04.180]  That's his jacket.
[43:04.700 --> 43:05.840]  So he's like on board.
[43:05.940 --> 43:06.360]  Oh, yeah.
[43:06.720 --> 43:07.140]  He's dead.
[43:07.140 --> 43:07.680]  Oh, he's dead now.
[43:07.900 --> 43:08.220]  Yeah, yeah.
[43:08.240 --> 43:10.220]  He gave her the jacket and everything and gave her like the nickname.
[43:10.460 --> 43:15.340]  One of the greatest cameos in the history of television was when he played the Mangler
[43:15.340 --> 43:15.980]  on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
[43:15.980 --> 43:16.820]  Oh, it's great, isn't it?
[43:16.880 --> 43:17.040]  Yeah.
[43:17.740 --> 43:18.860]  And he's like, you got kids, Mangler?
[43:18.960 --> 43:19.780]  He's like, no.
[43:21.720 --> 43:22.240]  Not anymore.
[43:23.120 --> 43:23.760]  It's great.
[43:24.040 --> 43:24.880]  It's so good.
[43:25.700 --> 43:27.700]  He's got a bucket of walnuts in his back of the car.
[43:27.720 --> 43:28.140]  Yeah, he's just awesome.
[43:29.000 --> 43:29.860]  Is that Cedric Alexander?
[43:30.020 --> 43:30.940]  Some more shit happening.
[43:31.240 --> 43:32.340]  Here's this guy doing that thing.
[43:32.840 --> 43:34.180]  That's old Stone Cold, what?
[43:34.680 --> 43:35.580]  He's a Texan, right?
[43:35.720 --> 43:38.080]  Oh, hell yeah, from Victoria, Texas, what?
[43:40.340 --> 43:41.960]  That's old Stone Cold.
[43:42.540 --> 43:43.960]  Back when he had abs.
[43:46.420 --> 43:47.740]  I love Stone Cold Steve Austin.
[43:47.760 --> 43:49.360]  Dude, that's a hidden talent I didn't know you had.
[43:49.360 --> 43:50.600]  Dude, his Stone Cold impression's a blast.
[43:50.660 --> 43:51.940]  It was like he was in the room.
[43:51.940 --> 43:52.900]  I thought he was the best.
[43:53.560 --> 43:54.940]  He's a good follow on Instagram.
[43:55.180 --> 43:58.320]  He posts a lot of pictures of his dogs and his cat that lives in a barn.
[43:58.700 --> 44:00.340]  Didn't he run for office or something?
[44:00.780 --> 44:00.920]  What?
[44:01.100 --> 44:01.260]  No.
[44:01.420 --> 44:02.400]  No, that was Jesse the Body.
[44:02.580 --> 44:03.320]  Ah, sorry.
[44:03.340 --> 44:04.160]  Another follow by a guy.
[44:04.220 --> 44:06.540]  He was the governor of Minnesota.
[44:06.940 --> 44:07.340]  That's right.
[44:07.700 --> 44:08.440]  Here's another one.
[44:10.080 --> 44:11.640]  Vampire Diaries loves sex.
[44:12.300 --> 44:13.940]  I've never seen the Vampire Diaries.
[44:14.780 --> 44:16.040]  I know Michael Jones is a big fan.
[44:16.160 --> 44:17.160]  I wish he was here for this.
[44:17.240 --> 44:19.400]  I've been holding off on revenge cards until Michael shows up.
[44:19.420 --> 44:19.780]  Is this like Twilight or TV?
[44:20.200 --> 44:21.000]  Yeah, it's like TV Twilight.
[44:21.000 --> 44:24.180]  Is that guy's name Ian Summerholder or something?
[44:24.640 --> 44:25.780]  Yeah, he's like way too pretty.
[44:25.880 --> 44:27.820]  He was in Rules of Attraction.
[44:27.960 --> 44:28.660]  It's a great movie.
[44:29.380 --> 44:31.740]  I mean, it's not a good movie, but I think I really enjoy it.
[44:31.960 --> 44:32.960]  I believe...
[44:32.960 --> 44:33.460]  He was in Lost.
[44:33.820 --> 44:35.020]  He was Boone.
[44:35.340 --> 44:36.500]  Oh, yeah, Boone and Lost.
[44:36.540 --> 44:36.880]  You're right.
[44:37.420 --> 44:38.720]  That is Boone from Lost.
[44:39.820 --> 44:40.760]  So these are...
[44:40.760 --> 44:43.520]  You look for randomly inserted autograph and wardrobe cards.
[44:43.620 --> 44:46.220]  And this was sent to us by a regulation listener as well.
[44:46.800 --> 44:47.720]  Or I guess a comment leaver.
[44:47.720 --> 44:48.360]  A comment leaver.
[44:48.500 --> 44:48.680]  Yeah.
[44:49.080 --> 44:49.720]  I don't remember.
[44:49.820 --> 44:52.240]  I don't have it written down who it was, but they sent a couple of these.
[44:52.400 --> 44:54.280]  So thank you out there.
[44:54.360 --> 44:55.100]  Let's see if we got something good.
[44:55.100 --> 44:55.440]  Let's see if we...
[44:55.440 --> 44:56.740]  Oh, these are...
[44:56.740 --> 44:57.560]  We got sticky.
[44:58.000 --> 44:58.480]  Oh, weird.
[44:59.080 --> 44:59.400]  Okay.
[44:59.640 --> 45:00.540]  We have...
[45:00.540 --> 45:00.980]  Oops.
[45:01.980 --> 45:03.360]  Here's a deal with the devil.
[45:03.560 --> 45:04.280]  All right.
[45:05.780 --> 45:06.420]  And then...
[45:07.140 --> 45:07.780]  Oh, no.
[45:08.500 --> 45:09.580]  She has so much hair.
[45:09.640 --> 45:10.740]  An unexpected romance?
[45:11.000 --> 45:11.100]  Is her neck long?
[45:11.260 --> 45:11.720]  I don't know.
[45:12.460 --> 45:12.920]  How's her neck?
[45:12.980 --> 45:13.380]  She got...
[45:13.380 --> 45:14.040]  Yeah, it looks like...
[45:14.040 --> 45:14.440]  You know what I mean?
[45:14.480 --> 45:16.100]  It's like a lot of hair that's going...
[45:16.100 --> 45:16.920]  She's got a long neck.
[45:16.920 --> 45:18.380]  So, like, her head looks small.
[45:18.500 --> 45:20.020]  Let's save that for, like, extra neck.
[45:21.200 --> 45:21.760]  Well, I mean, it's...
[45:21.760 --> 45:22.440]  Little head, big neck.
[45:24.360 --> 45:25.040]  Giraffe style.
[45:25.520 --> 45:26.160]  This one...
[45:26.160 --> 45:27.920]  This is just a...
[45:28.460 --> 45:29.760]  Elena Gilbert card.
[45:30.320 --> 45:30.960]  Is that the same lady?
[45:31.140 --> 45:31.460]  Yeah.
[45:31.560 --> 45:31.800]  Yeah.
[45:32.220 --> 45:33.440]  Oh, unwelcome reunion.
[45:33.860 --> 45:34.040]  Uh-huh.
[45:34.200 --> 45:35.460]  Here we have that dude.
[45:35.960 --> 45:36.320]  And we get...
[45:36.320 --> 45:37.140]  Jesus Christ.
[45:37.220 --> 45:38.140]  That guy looks like a werewolf.
[45:38.300 --> 45:39.540]  We get a piece of a...
[45:39.540 --> 45:40.580]  Of a...
[45:40.580 --> 45:42.140]  Picture that we can put together in frame and put it on the wall.
[45:42.160 --> 45:42.520]  Lovesa.
[45:42.640 --> 45:43.360]  If we can collect it all.
[45:43.360 --> 45:43.720]  Lovesa.
[45:43.800 --> 45:45.220]  So let's save that.
[45:45.520 --> 45:46.460]  Yeah, that's what we're going to do.
[45:46.500 --> 45:47.860]  We're going to do all the vampire diaries.
[45:47.920 --> 45:48.360]  Well, I have more.
[45:48.400 --> 45:49.560]  I have more of these.
[45:49.680 --> 45:50.260]  We'll open more later.
[45:50.540 --> 45:51.100]  Some other day.
[45:51.200 --> 45:52.180]  But we'll hold on to that.
[45:52.260 --> 45:53.380]  And someday we can complete the whole...
[45:53.380 --> 45:53.880]  Yeah, we won't.
[45:53.940 --> 45:54.620]  But, yeah, no, I agree.
[45:54.860 --> 45:55.940]  Now we're going to open...
[45:56.600 --> 45:58.180]  Panini Contenders Football 2021.
[45:58.720 --> 45:59.840]  We got a little over 10 minutes.
[46:00.000 --> 46:00.680]  We got a little over 10 minutes.
[46:00.720 --> 46:02.600]  We're going to open this fast and we're going to...
[46:02.600 --> 46:03.720]  Open more shit.
[46:03.820 --> 46:04.140]  I want to...
[46:04.140 --> 46:04.880]  Stuff I want to open.
[46:05.160 --> 46:05.440]  Okay.
[46:06.600 --> 46:07.160]  Aaron Rodgers.
[46:07.300 --> 46:08.220]  Well, he's a lot of fun.
[46:09.900 --> 46:10.640]  Who do we have here?
[46:10.780 --> 46:11.360]  Tom Brady.
[46:11.460 --> 46:11.900]  Heard of him.
[46:12.920 --> 46:13.480]  Travis Kelsey.
[46:14.280 --> 46:14.840]  Lamar Jackson.
[46:15.820 --> 46:17.040]  These are all quarterbacks.
[46:17.120 --> 46:17.540]  Is that what we're doing?
[46:18.280 --> 46:18.780]  Miles Garrett.
[46:18.780 --> 46:19.480]  No, it's just...
[46:19.880 --> 46:20.320]  Just going that way.
[46:20.320 --> 46:21.280]  It just happened to be.
[46:21.320 --> 46:21.980]  DeAndre Hopkins.
[46:22.240 --> 46:22.480]  Okay.
[46:22.880 --> 46:23.440]  Chain movers.
[46:23.760 --> 46:24.880]  Not much going on there.
[46:25.340 --> 46:29.420]  With 10 minutes to go, we're going to do a box of NBA Prism.
[46:29.680 --> 46:29.940]  Okay.
[46:30.680 --> 46:33.840]  And then we're going to open one or two Jackass and Mischief cards.
[46:34.620 --> 46:37.100]  I mean, you could save the Jackass cards until we get the other guys.
[46:37.500 --> 46:38.640]  I could, but we can't.
[46:38.820 --> 46:39.560]  God damn it.
[46:39.620 --> 46:40.560]  I've been waiting for...
[46:40.560 --> 46:42.580]  I bought that box, like, three months ago.
[46:42.580 --> 46:43.480]  Yeah, when did the movie come out?
[46:44.600 --> 46:45.000]  Yeah.
[46:45.000 --> 46:46.000]  Forever ago.
[46:46.700 --> 46:46.940]  Pack sack.
[46:46.960 --> 46:47.280]  Here we go.
[46:48.300 --> 46:48.680]  Yeah.
[46:49.500 --> 46:51.600]  I'm going to make sure I don't put a relic in the pack.
[46:52.180 --> 46:52.640]  All right, hold on.
[46:54.160 --> 46:54.880]  Yeah, that'll do.
[46:55.340 --> 46:55.740]  Okay.
[46:56.140 --> 46:56.800]  Feed the pack sack.
[46:56.900 --> 46:57.100]  Pack sack.
[46:57.100 --> 46:57.620]  Pack sack's got to eat.
[46:57.760 --> 46:58.580]  Oh, boy.
[46:58.880 --> 46:59.760]  Oh, boy.
[47:00.060 --> 47:00.500]  Over here.
[47:00.980 --> 47:01.280]  Sorry.
[47:01.880 --> 47:02.280]  Sorry.
[47:02.980 --> 47:04.320]  All right, we are going to burn through these.
[47:04.440 --> 47:04.640]  Let's do it.
[47:04.660 --> 47:05.440]  Obie Toppen.
[47:05.540 --> 47:05.720]  Yeah.
[47:05.880 --> 47:06.660]  Tyler Hero.
[47:06.900 --> 47:07.160]  Boo.
[47:07.620 --> 47:08.960]  Setti Osman, silver.
[47:09.180 --> 47:09.400]  Okay.
[47:09.400 --> 47:10.020]  Nice.
[47:10.620 --> 47:11.420]  Cam Johnson.
[47:13.660 --> 47:14.460]  He's got...
[47:15.580 --> 47:16.340]  You got it.
[47:16.500 --> 47:17.680]  Sideshow Bob here, I think.
[47:18.660 --> 47:19.480]  There you go.
[47:20.100 --> 47:21.640]  There are, like, five cards in each of these?
[47:21.760 --> 47:21.860]  Four.
[47:23.020 --> 47:23.180]  Yeah.
[47:23.400 --> 47:25.000]  Sorry, can't believe I overestimated.
[47:25.280 --> 47:26.760]  Yeah, and they're fucking expensive, too.
[47:27.840 --> 47:28.240]  Great.
[47:28.420 --> 47:29.040]  Dwayne Bacon.
[47:29.340 --> 47:30.560]  These are the most insane packs that he runs.
[47:30.940 --> 47:33.220]  Dude, this box right here, Emily bought one of these.
[47:33.480 --> 47:35.420]  One of these in Detroit was $80.
[47:35.900 --> 47:36.300]  Yeah.
[47:36.540 --> 47:37.380]  Oh, my God.
[47:37.460 --> 47:39.140]  Well, it said the Hobby Box was, like, $1,000.
[47:40.180 --> 47:40.540]  Yeah.
[47:41.120 --> 47:42.820]  Well, it's more, but it's...
[47:42.820 --> 47:43.140]  Hobby Box is more.
[47:43.140 --> 47:43.960]  But it's more cards?
[47:44.620 --> 47:46.620]  Hobby Box is more than a blaster, yeah.
[47:47.700 --> 47:49.140]  At least for these.
[47:49.220 --> 47:49.580]  More money.
[47:49.820 --> 47:50.580]  More money, for sure.
[47:52.020 --> 47:52.380]  Sandro...
[47:52.380 --> 47:54.340]  I can't say this guy's last name, but he's a rookie.
[47:55.280 --> 47:55.840]  There you go.
[47:56.120 --> 47:56.540]  Oh, shit.
[47:56.640 --> 47:57.020]  This is nice.
[47:57.300 --> 47:58.980]  Trey Mann, green parallel rookie.
[47:59.100 --> 47:59.420]  That's good.
[47:59.520 --> 47:59.980]  That's cool.
[48:00.140 --> 48:00.620]  Okay, C.
[48:01.600 --> 48:02.320]  And then...
[48:02.320 --> 48:05.760]  Can we keep the Dwayne Bacon for the name and for the face?
[48:06.000 --> 48:06.300]  Yeah, for sure.
[48:06.300 --> 48:07.080]  That's a pretty good one.
[48:07.720 --> 48:09.240]  Bacon goes into, uh...
[48:09.240 --> 48:09.360]  For the face.
[48:10.320 --> 48:14.220]  Well, we had talked early on about wanting to build a team that's with dinner.
[48:14.460 --> 48:15.180]  Oh, that's right!
[48:15.340 --> 48:16.240]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[48:16.360 --> 48:16.400]  A meal team.
[48:16.560 --> 48:18.200]  So, Meal Team Six, we call it.
[48:19.060 --> 48:20.000]  Dwayne Bacon could be in it.
[48:20.560 --> 48:22.400]  Here's Drazen Petrovic, Cracked Ice.
[48:22.780 --> 48:23.920]  Classic Drazen Petrovic.
[48:23.980 --> 48:25.000]  Did you say Packed Ice?
[48:25.320 --> 48:25.920]  Cracked Ice.
[48:26.300 --> 48:26.620]  Oh, yeah.
[48:27.120 --> 48:27.480]  Of course.
[48:27.780 --> 48:28.600]  I can't believe I said that.
[48:29.620 --> 48:30.420]  Four cards, huh?
[48:30.500 --> 48:30.720]  All right.
[48:33.480 --> 48:34.380]  Geoff, ten minutes.
[48:34.900 --> 48:35.360]  Dwayne Bacon...
[48:35.360 --> 48:37.200]  Oh, I had another idea, I was thinking the other day.
[48:37.280 --> 48:37.480]  Okay.
[48:37.480 --> 48:38.480]  We should do...
[48:39.320 --> 48:44.820]  We should collect the rookie cards for every NBA player who's dated a Kardashian.
[48:45.940 --> 48:46.380]  That's a good idea.
[48:46.540 --> 48:47.080]  There's a lot.
[48:47.340 --> 48:47.360]  Yeah.
[48:47.440 --> 48:48.320]  There's James Harden.
[48:48.380 --> 48:48.520]  Uh-huh.
[48:48.560 --> 48:49.480]  There's Devin Booker.
[48:49.560 --> 48:49.740]  Uh-huh.
[48:49.800 --> 48:51.420]  There's, uh...
[48:51.420 --> 48:51.820]  Lamar Odom.
[48:52.000 --> 48:52.820]  Lamar Odom.
[48:53.200 --> 48:54.200]  There's, uh...
[48:54.200 --> 48:55.360]  Chris Humphries.
[48:55.660 --> 48:55.760]  Uh-huh.
[48:55.880 --> 48:56.420]  There's, uh...
[48:56.420 --> 48:57.500]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[48:57.680 --> 48:59.260]  Ben Simmons.
[48:59.440 --> 48:59.640]  Uh-huh.
[49:00.100 --> 49:00.860]  These are good.
[49:01.820 --> 49:02.480]  There's more.
[49:02.700 --> 49:03.040]  We can make a team.
[49:03.040 --> 49:03.620]  I'm missing somebody.
[49:03.680 --> 49:04.260]  I'm missing somebody.
[49:04.260 --> 49:05.800]  I'll get back to...
[49:05.800 --> 49:06.440]  We can make a whole team.
[49:06.500 --> 49:07.140]  Yeah, you can make a whole team.
[49:07.180 --> 49:10.060]  You can have a whole starting lineup of people who dated the Kardashians.
[49:10.600 --> 49:11.560]  Who's the sixth man?
[49:12.420 --> 49:13.240]  There is a sixth man.
[49:13.320 --> 49:14.020]  I just can't think of who it is.
[49:14.260 --> 49:15.920]  It's slipping my mind right now.
[49:16.540 --> 49:17.140]  Derek Favors.
[49:18.180 --> 49:18.780]  Darius Baisley.
[49:19.580 --> 49:20.640]  Ooh, purple wave.
[49:20.800 --> 49:21.580]  Fred Van Vliet.
[49:21.780 --> 49:22.220]  Ooh, nice.
[49:22.300 --> 49:25.820]  One of the only people to make the All-Star Game and wasn't drafted.
[49:26.860 --> 49:27.500]  Really good player.
[49:27.620 --> 49:28.000]  I like him.
[49:28.020 --> 49:28.540]  He's a little guy.
[49:28.620 --> 49:29.060]  I like him, too.
[49:29.780 --> 49:31.320]  I'm not a fan of the Raptors, but I like him.
[49:31.500 --> 49:32.640]  And then Instant Impact.
[49:32.920 --> 49:33.370]  Quentin Grimes.
[49:33.750 --> 49:34.110]  Quentin Grimes.
[49:34.230 --> 49:34.870]  Parallel rookie.
[49:36.730 --> 49:37.270]  Kind of.
[49:37.530 --> 49:38.390]  Instant Impact.
[49:40.770 --> 49:42.230]  Those Instant Impact cards are ugly.
[49:42.350 --> 49:43.370]  Look how ugly this card is.
[49:43.650 --> 49:43.930]  Yuck.
[49:44.310 --> 49:44.910]  They're really ugly.
[49:45.050 --> 49:46.510]  It looks like there's a big spider behind it.
[49:46.670 --> 49:47.650]  Yeah, it looks like he's...
[49:47.650 --> 49:49.170]  It looks like he's in the underneath.
[49:49.350 --> 49:51.350]  He has six devil tails coming out of him.
[49:51.750 --> 49:53.630]  It's like he's got an octopus coming out of his butthole.
[49:53.650 --> 49:53.830]  Yeah.
[49:54.010 --> 49:54.530]  Save that.
[49:54.550 --> 49:55.270]  That's the Instant Impact.
[49:55.650 --> 49:56.910]  Octo-ass, they call him.
[49:59.370 --> 49:59.970]  Octo-mom.
[49:59.970 --> 50:04.930]  Do you think Quentin Grimes, when he has a good game, they kind of say he's getting grimy?
[50:05.650 --> 50:05.910]  Yeah.
[50:06.030 --> 50:06.710]  I hope they start that.
[50:06.990 --> 50:07.430]  Jordan Loira.
[50:07.610 --> 50:08.830]  If they do start that, it happened here first.
[50:09.090 --> 50:09.790]  Reggie Bullock.
[50:10.030 --> 50:11.190]  Another Franz Wagner rookie.
[50:11.330 --> 50:12.870]  Oh, this one's fucking...
[50:12.870 --> 50:14.070]  Look at that bullshit.
[50:14.370 --> 50:15.070]  Is it all fucked up?
[50:15.230 --> 50:16.550]  Yeah, you see that right there at the top?
[50:16.770 --> 50:17.050]  Bummer.
[50:17.510 --> 50:17.990]  That's a bummer.
[50:18.330 --> 50:19.230]  Oh, thank God we got the other one.
[50:19.670 --> 50:20.850]  And then, what do we got there?
[50:20.910 --> 50:21.430]  Daron Sharp.
[50:21.890 --> 50:21.990]  Emergent.
[50:23.150 --> 50:23.730]  I don't know.
[50:23.850 --> 50:24.850]  Real shame about that.
[50:25.670 --> 50:26.190]  That's a bummer.
[50:26.350 --> 50:26.850]  Worthless card.
[50:26.890 --> 50:27.510]  Is this the last one?
[50:27.790 --> 50:29.270]  This is the last Prism pack.
[50:29.270 --> 50:30.150]  Heartbreaker.
[50:30.910 --> 50:33.070]  And then, maybe we'll save Jackass, but we'll open a Mischief.
[50:33.370 --> 50:33.830]  How about that?
[50:34.890 --> 50:35.770]  I don't know what that is, but...
[50:35.770 --> 50:36.050]  Ah, fuck.
[50:36.250 --> 50:36.530]  Yeah.
[50:37.130 --> 50:38.070]  Okay, here we go.
[50:39.390 --> 50:40.350]  Anthony Edwards.
[50:40.870 --> 50:41.550]  Lugans Dort.
[50:41.910 --> 50:42.350]  Dort!
[50:42.450 --> 50:42.750]  Dort!
[50:42.910 --> 50:43.950]  He's a great player, though.
[50:43.970 --> 50:44.590]  Great player.
[50:44.970 --> 50:47.410]  Here's a poorly, poorly cut Joe Weiskamp rookie.
[50:47.590 --> 50:47.830]  Bummer.
[50:49.570 --> 50:50.050]  Bummer.
[50:50.530 --> 50:52.730]  And then, this is a...
[50:52.730 --> 50:54.010]  Okay, I'll take this.
[50:54.290 --> 50:56.690]  This is a green parallel instant impact.
[50:56.750 --> 50:57.610]  Octo-ass.
[50:58.270 --> 50:59.230]  Evan Mobley.
[51:00.030 --> 51:00.430]  Wow!
[51:00.730 --> 51:01.510]  It does.
[51:01.610 --> 51:03.210]  You can see the difference between this one and the other one.
[51:03.290 --> 51:05.810]  Why is that the card backing for instant impact?
[51:05.810 --> 51:06.790]  Dude, I don't know.
[51:06.890 --> 51:07.190]  That's crazy.
[51:07.190 --> 51:08.050]  I don't know where they came up with that from.
[51:08.150 --> 51:08.630]  These are terrible.
[51:08.770 --> 51:09.690]  But, yeah.
[51:09.910 --> 51:11.630]  So, this is not good.
[51:11.710 --> 51:14.210]  This is probably worth 30, 40 bucks.
[51:14.610 --> 51:15.250]  Damn, nice.
[51:15.490 --> 51:17.190]  Yeah, well, it's Evan Mobley, and it's a parallel.
[51:18.050 --> 51:22.230]  The rookie inserts aren't worth as much as regular rookie base cards, but because it's
[51:22.230 --> 51:24.130]  a parallel, it's worth more.
[51:24.390 --> 51:24.670]  Nice.
[51:24.910 --> 51:25.530]  Yeah, there you go.
[51:26.030 --> 51:28.170]  We have seven minutes left.
[51:28.170 --> 51:29.070]  What is mischief?
[51:29.850 --> 51:30.890]  We're going to get there in just a second.
[51:31.050 --> 51:31.390]  Oh, okay.
[51:31.590 --> 51:34.010]  But first, we're going to open up a pack of 1990 tops.
[51:34.050 --> 51:34.450]  Oh, cool.
[51:34.510 --> 51:35.470]  See if we can grab a Zim.
[51:35.670 --> 51:36.030]  Why not?
[51:36.170 --> 51:37.410]  Yeah, no shit!
[51:39.450 --> 51:41.650]  Because we haven't had a Zim in a long, long, long time.
[51:42.170 --> 51:45.870]  We got intentional Zims earlier in the show, but those are, again, intentional.
[51:46.750 --> 51:50.590]  Chuck Finley, Bud Black, Joey Bell, Benito Santiago.
[51:51.050 --> 51:52.130]  It says Benny, but his name's Benito.
[51:52.850 --> 51:57.250]  Clay Parker, Kirby Puckett again, Stan Javier, Vaughn Hayes.
[51:57.250 --> 51:57.990]  We got him earlier, too.
[51:58.070 --> 51:58.770]  Dennis Eckersley.
[51:58.890 --> 52:00.650]  Now, that's a fucking relief pitcher right there.
[52:01.190 --> 52:01.830]  Ken Phelps.
[52:01.890 --> 52:02.910]  They had a great mustache, too.
[52:03.670 --> 52:04.390]  Kurt Ford.
[52:04.450 --> 52:05.290]  Whoa, hey, Ken Phelps.
[52:05.310 --> 52:06.330]  Hold on, going back, going back.
[52:06.450 --> 52:07.190]  That's a soup strainer.
[52:07.230 --> 52:08.270]  Oh, my Lord.
[52:09.090 --> 52:10.370]  I totally would have missed that.
[52:10.390 --> 52:12.470]  Wow, Ken Phelps, that's a great look.
[52:12.490 --> 52:13.970]  That's a lot going on there.
[52:14.030 --> 52:16.830]  That looks like a guy dressed up like a baseball player, but does not play baseball.
[52:16.990 --> 52:17.550]  We're saving that.
[52:18.350 --> 52:20.570]  Randy Myers, the Ozzie Smith.
[52:20.690 --> 52:21.050]  Nice.
[52:21.250 --> 52:21.790]  Save that.
[52:22.950 --> 52:27.390]  Mike Marshall, Floyd Bannister, and John Smoltz.
[52:27.570 --> 52:27.750]  Nice.
[52:27.830 --> 52:28.170]  Another great pitcher.
[52:28.470 --> 52:28.730]  Okay.
[52:28.910 --> 52:30.010]  No Zim, but...
[52:30.010 --> 52:30.470]  No Zim.
[52:30.730 --> 52:31.490]  Close enough, though.
[52:32.250 --> 52:34.750]  Okay, so, we're gonna end on Mischief Cards.
[52:34.830 --> 52:35.090]  Okay.
[52:35.810 --> 52:36.170]  So...
[52:36.170 --> 52:37.030]  What is Mischief Cards?
[52:37.450 --> 52:40.010]  Mischief is this fucking cool company that just do weird stuff.
[52:40.110 --> 52:40.870]  Like, they have a...
[52:41.530 --> 52:43.970]  Have you heard me talk about the million dollar puzzle I'm putting together right now?
[52:44.350 --> 52:44.930]  No, what?
[52:44.930 --> 52:45.730]  I bought a five...
[52:45.730 --> 52:46.430]  They sold a puzzle.
[52:46.550 --> 52:47.270]  They sold a bunch of them.
[52:47.370 --> 52:47.570]  Uh-huh.
[52:47.890 --> 52:49.030]  And then you put it together.
[52:49.130 --> 52:49.810]  You don't get a picture of it.
[52:49.810 --> 52:50.330]  You put it together.
[52:50.430 --> 52:51.010]  It's a QR code.
[52:51.090 --> 52:54.570]  You scan that QR code, and then you enter it in a website, and you can win either a dollar,
[52:54.990 --> 52:57.430]  ten dollars, a hundred dollars, a thousand dollars, a hundred thousand dollars, or a
[52:57.430 --> 52:57.830]  million dollars.
[52:58.030 --> 52:58.130]  What?
[52:58.350 --> 52:58.530]  Yeah.
[52:58.790 --> 53:00.670]  It's a hard puzzle to put together, though, without a picture.
[53:01.270 --> 53:03.390]  Because if they showed you the picture, then you could just scan the picture.
[53:03.550 --> 53:03.650]  Great.
[53:04.010 --> 53:05.290]  So, anyway, they do stuff like that.
[53:05.650 --> 53:08.470]  So, these are their Spring Break Booster Pack cards.
[53:08.490 --> 53:08.550]  Oh, cool.
[53:08.570 --> 53:09.370]  And I've been wanting to open these.
[53:09.410 --> 53:10.630]  I had to buy these on StockX.
[53:11.030 --> 53:11.210]  Really?
[53:11.210 --> 53:12.630]  This one box was like a hundred...
[53:12.630 --> 53:13.570]  That's where I get all my...
[53:13.570 --> 53:14.090]  Eighty bucks.
[53:14.170 --> 53:14.730]  That's where I get all my shoes.
[53:14.730 --> 53:15.890]  I'm a big sneakerhead, guys.
[53:16.030 --> 53:16.450]  Yeah, you are.
[53:16.590 --> 53:16.750]  Yeah.
[53:16.850 --> 53:19.650]  So, we're going to open half of this, and then we're going to save the rest.
[53:19.650 --> 53:20.270]  Somebody's doing a pack sack.
[53:22.470 --> 53:23.890]  Listen, I'm feeding the pack sack, bro.
[53:23.990 --> 53:24.490]  Yeah, you are.
[53:24.530 --> 53:24.730]  You are.
[53:24.790 --> 53:25.030]  You're right.
[53:26.090 --> 53:26.490]  You're right.
[53:26.570 --> 53:26.810]  You're right.
[53:26.950 --> 53:26.990]  You're right.
[53:26.990 --> 53:27.090]  You're right.
[53:28.190 --> 53:28.970]  Goes in the pack sack.
[53:29.930 --> 53:31.510]  Okay, and after these cards, we're done.
[53:31.570 --> 53:31.830]  Okay.
[53:31.930 --> 53:32.430]  Turn it off.
[53:33.730 --> 53:34.490]  So, here we go.
[53:34.550 --> 53:34.950]  Turn it off.
[53:35.410 --> 53:36.470]  Turn it off and go to hell.
[53:37.390 --> 53:38.610]  Booster Pack Spring Break.
[53:38.690 --> 53:40.850]  Let's see what kind of weird shit we get.
[53:40.890 --> 53:41.170]  Okay.
[53:41.410 --> 53:42.630]  Five cards in here.
[53:42.890 --> 53:43.730]  I hope...
[53:43.730 --> 53:44.370]  I hope we find Emily.
[53:44.450 --> 53:45.170]  I hope there's a dog.
[53:46.130 --> 53:49.270]  I hope that there is a...
[53:49.270 --> 53:50.810]  This fraud marks the spot.
[53:51.690 --> 53:52.910]  I hope there's a gum wrapper.
[53:53.330 --> 53:53.810]  There might be.
[53:53.990 --> 53:54.650]  But no gum.
[53:54.830 --> 53:55.230]  But just the wrapper.
[53:55.230 --> 53:55.850]  Yeah, just the wrapper.
[53:55.950 --> 53:56.350]  I like that.
[53:56.830 --> 53:56.870]  Okay.
[53:57.190 --> 53:58.210]  Geoff, any hopes for anything?
[53:58.390 --> 53:59.970]  I just hope I don't get the fucking package open.
[54:00.210 --> 54:00.990]  You're almost there.
[54:01.350 --> 54:02.470]  Okay, let's see what we got.
[54:02.690 --> 54:02.890]  Okay.
[54:02.990 --> 54:03.710]  These are going to be fun.
[54:04.030 --> 54:04.390]  Here we go.
[54:04.470 --> 54:07.850]  We got a student ID FSU card.
[54:07.890 --> 54:08.030]  What?
[54:09.670 --> 54:10.830]  What is this?
[54:10.910 --> 54:11.710]  I'm telling you, it's weird.
[54:12.170 --> 54:15.070]  We got a Miami Beach tie-on hotel room key.
[54:15.270 --> 54:15.550]  Okay.
[54:16.410 --> 54:17.830]  We got a...
[54:17.830 --> 54:17.930]  Oh!
[54:18.210 --> 54:19.510]  Here's a Venmo debit card.
[54:20.270 --> 54:22.270]  So that'll work, and that'll have real money on it.
[54:22.510 --> 54:22.710]  What?
[54:22.830 --> 54:23.090]  For real?
[54:23.190 --> 54:23.670]  Yeah, it should.
[54:23.830 --> 54:24.350]  Yeah, I think so.
[54:24.450 --> 54:25.030]  I think it's a real card.
[54:25.690 --> 54:26.450]  It's one of the chase cards.
[54:26.590 --> 54:27.290]  How do you make it work?
[54:27.570 --> 54:28.190]  Can I scan it?
[54:28.990 --> 54:29.730]  Scan it, yeah.
[54:30.030 --> 54:30.710]  It's got a...
[54:30.710 --> 54:31.870]  I mean, I wouldn't show the camera.
[54:32.330 --> 54:32.890]  But yeah, you know.
[54:33.590 --> 54:34.850]  We have a...
[54:34.850 --> 54:35.750]  Oh, here we go.
[54:35.950 --> 54:37.350]  Here's a picture of Florida Man.
[54:37.670 --> 54:38.610]  We got a Florida Man card.
[54:38.610 --> 54:38.990]  There he is.
[54:39.810 --> 54:40.130]  There you go.
[54:40.130 --> 54:41.210]  He looks like Topher...
[54:41.210 --> 54:42.110]  He does look like Topher Grace.
[54:42.110 --> 54:42.510]  Topher Grace.
[54:42.770 --> 54:42.870]  Yeah.
[54:44.550 --> 54:45.030]  Florida Man.
[54:45.130 --> 54:48.570]  Florida's government records transparency laws make all states' mugshots publicly available.
[54:49.150 --> 54:53.690]  The Florida Man phenomenon results from the inherent zany lawlessness of Florida's citizens,
[54:53.850 --> 54:57.890]  at least not entirely, but because their home state offers them up as public fodder for scrutiny.
[54:58.150 --> 54:58.390]  Wow.
[54:58.530 --> 54:59.050]  Oh, there you go.
[54:59.070 --> 54:59.570]  You learned something new.
[54:59.630 --> 55:00.450]  Just a guy, huh?
[55:00.890 --> 55:01.450]  Just a guy.
[55:01.490 --> 55:02.130]  Just Florida Man.
[55:02.270 --> 55:03.390]  And then we have a...
[55:03.390 --> 55:03.930]  Oh, here we go.
[55:04.390 --> 55:09.050]  This is a Florida citation for Hillsborough County for public urination.
[55:09.050 --> 55:09.670]  Oh.
[55:10.030 --> 55:10.810]  So we got a public urination.
[55:10.810 --> 55:11.990]  These cards are insane.
[55:12.650 --> 55:12.970]  Yeah.
[55:13.290 --> 55:14.190]  These are weird.
[55:14.310 --> 55:15.070]  They are very weird.
[55:15.270 --> 55:16.250]  These are spring break cards.
[55:16.610 --> 55:17.450]  So they're...
[55:17.450 --> 55:18.250]  What the fuck?
[55:18.370 --> 55:18.850]  I know, dude.
[55:18.910 --> 55:20.010]  I've been so excited to open them.
[55:20.050 --> 55:20.650]  These are weird.
[55:20.990 --> 55:21.510]  Months I've been waiting.
[55:21.510 --> 55:22.810]  I do think we might find a dog.
[55:24.650 --> 55:25.450]  Maybe it's like a relic.
[55:25.510 --> 55:26.110]  Like dog hair.
[55:26.570 --> 55:26.710]  Yeah.
[55:26.890 --> 55:28.550]  Well, now that I'm aware of what it is...
[55:28.550 --> 55:28.710]  Yeah.
[55:29.970 --> 55:30.290]  I'm...
[55:30.790 --> 55:32.570]  I guess a gum wrapper would still...
[55:32.570 --> 55:32.910]  Yeah, right.
[55:33.070 --> 55:33.710]  Possibly be in there.
[55:33.730 --> 55:34.330]  I feel like it's still a thing, yeah.
[55:35.570 --> 55:36.810]  Geoff's gonna figure out how to open these packs.
[55:36.850 --> 55:37.470]  It's gonna be so sick.
[55:38.070 --> 55:39.870]  I don't think cutting that little piece...
[55:39.870 --> 55:40.650]  ...is still seen.
[55:41.050 --> 55:42.270]  No, that was a bad idea.
[55:42.430 --> 55:42.530]  Yeah.
[55:42.610 --> 55:42.910]  Here we go.
[55:43.290 --> 55:44.370]  Looks like there's a ripped tab at the top.
[55:44.370 --> 55:46.090]  Yeah, there's a ripped tab at the top, I discovered.
[55:46.250 --> 55:47.190]  After I cut it off.
[55:47.710 --> 55:48.470]  On the other one.
[55:50.210 --> 55:50.710]  You got it.
[55:50.750 --> 55:51.830]  Learn something new every day.
[55:52.010 --> 55:52.450]  You're getting it.
[55:53.290 --> 55:53.810]  Almost there.
[55:54.150 --> 55:55.010]  Please don't cut your finger.
[55:55.230 --> 55:55.930]  Cut away from yourself.
[55:56.430 --> 55:56.970]  Towards me.
[55:58.270 --> 55:59.050]  I'll catch it.
[55:59.190 --> 55:59.650]  It's fine.
[56:02.450 --> 56:03.470]  We're almost there, guys.
[56:03.510 --> 56:04.770]  We almost have the second pack.
[56:05.270 --> 56:06.090]  Here we go.
[56:06.090 --> 56:07.270]  All right, here it comes.
[56:07.310 --> 56:07.790]  All right, here we go.
[56:07.810 --> 56:08.630]  Second pack incoming.
[56:12.110 --> 56:16.550]  Here's a water diving membership card for Janice 2.
[56:16.730 --> 56:16.930]  What?
[56:17.250 --> 56:18.970]  Here's another Venmo debit card.
[56:19.230 --> 56:19.490]  Nice.
[56:20.570 --> 56:21.550]  Oh, here we go.
[56:21.750 --> 56:23.330]  Here's two tickets for Dave and Busters.
[56:24.470 --> 56:24.990]  Nice.
[56:26.710 --> 56:28.790]  Here's another FSU student ID.
[56:28.830 --> 56:29.110]  Cool.
[56:29.270 --> 56:29.570]  All set.
[56:30.070 --> 56:30.830]  Oh, and here we go.
[56:31.090 --> 56:32.090]  Here's somebody's...
[56:35.490 --> 56:38.930]  Open Access Plus Cigna group...
[56:38.930 --> 56:41.370]  Oh, that's just a medical card.
[56:41.510 --> 56:42.330]  Yeah, a medical ID card.
[56:42.430 --> 56:42.770]  That's cool.
[56:42.930 --> 56:44.890]  Is it like a PPO, a HMO?
[56:45.010 --> 56:46.530]  It is a...
[56:46.530 --> 56:47.670]  There's no way they have an FSA.
[56:47.690 --> 56:47.930]  They got a good plan?
[56:48.210 --> 56:48.990]  They got no FSA.
[56:49.370 --> 56:50.030]  You can feel it.
[56:51.510 --> 56:52.730]  I mean, it just says the group ID.
[56:53.110 --> 56:54.310]  It doesn't say...
[56:54.950 --> 56:56.570]  Primary care is $20 copay.
[56:57.010 --> 56:57.850]  Specialist care is $50.
[56:57.970 --> 56:58.730]  Urgent care is $25.
[56:58.870 --> 56:59.770]  ER is $200.
[57:01.450 --> 57:03.410]  It doesn't say if it's an HMO or a PPO.
[57:03.810 --> 57:03.890]  Interesting.
[57:05.930 --> 57:07.030]  Okay, we'll put that there.
[57:07.190 --> 57:08.650]  Don't forget, there's a RIP tab.
[57:10.870 --> 57:12.170]  RIP tab sucks.
[57:13.310 --> 57:14.550]  It's closer than you were, I guess.
[57:16.950 --> 57:19.390]  Well, they don't skimp on the packaging.
[57:24.350 --> 57:25.550]  How was this stream?
[57:25.750 --> 57:26.530]  It's not over.
[57:26.710 --> 57:27.530]  How do you like it so far?
[57:27.890 --> 57:28.570]  Lots of dead air.
[57:28.710 --> 57:28.850]  Yeah.
[57:30.150 --> 57:30.670]  Boom.
[57:31.210 --> 57:32.190]  What the fuck?
[57:32.310 --> 57:33.830]  You have to scan these and see what we're playing.
[57:33.970 --> 57:34.770]  Another Florida man.
[57:34.790 --> 57:35.710]  What's that guy again?
[57:36.310 --> 57:37.950]  Ritz Carlton Club Lounge.
[57:38.070 --> 57:38.570]  Nice.
[57:38.830 --> 57:39.750]  Hi there.
[57:41.070 --> 57:42.110]  Here's a...
[57:43.010 --> 57:44.970]  Ultra Music Festival wristband.
[57:45.130 --> 57:45.350]  What?
[57:45.850 --> 57:47.810]  We really might get a gum wrapper.
[57:47.910 --> 57:48.550]  I think so.
[57:49.210 --> 57:49.770]  And then...
[57:50.450 --> 57:51.070]  Oh, here we go.
[57:51.330 --> 57:52.130]  Here's a United...
[57:52.130 --> 57:56.770]  First class ticket for Christopher from Phoenix to...
[57:57.370 --> 57:57.690]  Nice.
[57:57.810 --> 57:58.890]  D.A.B., whoever that is.
[57:59.730 --> 58:00.310]  Daytona Beach.
[58:00.370 --> 58:00.830]  Daytona Beach.
[58:00.910 --> 58:01.230]  There you go.
[58:01.310 --> 58:01.770]  Makes sense.
[58:02.290 --> 58:03.270]  So we got a...
[58:03.270 --> 58:03.750]  Wow.
[58:03.930 --> 58:05.990]  We got one more pack and that's the end of the stream, huh?
[58:06.370 --> 58:07.090]  Yeah, then turn it off.
[58:07.950 --> 58:08.410]  There you go.
[58:08.550 --> 58:09.270]  This fucking sucks.
[58:15.150 --> 58:16.150]  I like these cards.
[58:16.210 --> 58:17.230]  I don't like opening these cards.
[58:17.350 --> 58:18.050]  I'm a fan.
[58:26.250 --> 58:27.090]  Hey, you got it.
[58:27.790 --> 58:28.510]  Okay, here we go.
[58:28.590 --> 58:29.950]  Last pack and then we have to go.
[58:29.950 --> 58:30.090]  Last pack.
[58:30.310 --> 58:31.570]  Let's see what we got.
[58:31.570 --> 58:32.030]  Here we go.
[58:32.030 --> 58:36.390]  We got another first class ticket for Cleopatra Dinkins.
[58:37.070 --> 58:40.250]  Cleopatra's going from BDU to Daytona Beach.
[58:40.570 --> 58:40.970]  BDU.
[58:41.750 --> 58:42.190]  I don't know.
[58:43.950 --> 58:44.750]  We got...
[58:45.190 --> 58:46.310]  Here is a...
[58:46.310 --> 58:46.990]  Boulder, Colorado.
[58:47.910 --> 58:48.590]  Doesn't make any sense.
[58:48.690 --> 58:49.150]  Time to feed the dog.
[58:49.170 --> 58:49.530]  Time to feed the dog.
[58:49.970 --> 58:50.590]  He needs his pill.
[58:50.910 --> 58:51.430]  Oh, no!
[58:51.530 --> 58:51.870]  Here we go.
[58:51.930 --> 58:54.990]  Your sex partner told you that he or she has been diagnosed with chlamydia.
[58:55.930 --> 58:57.790]  Here's how you get tested and treated.
[58:58.030 --> 58:59.010]  Helpful information.
[59:00.210 --> 59:01.390]  Give to the doctor or nurse.
[59:01.650 --> 59:02.230]  There you go.
[59:02.230 --> 59:03.950]  Then Florida man again.
[59:04.170 --> 59:05.030]  Tons of Florida mans.
[59:05.790 --> 59:07.310]  Oh, that's a good one.
[59:07.530 --> 59:07.990]  Here's a...
[59:07.990 --> 59:08.830]  This is, I think, legit.
[59:09.410 --> 59:10.170]  I'll cover the...
[59:10.790 --> 59:10.810]  Okay.
[59:11.130 --> 59:11.910]  Here's an IHOP.
[59:12.010 --> 59:13.530]  $10 gift card for IHOP.
[59:13.690 --> 59:14.050]  Awesome!
[59:14.090 --> 59:14.910]  And it's lenticular.
[59:16.170 --> 59:17.130]  And that works.
[59:17.150 --> 59:17.570]  That's real.
[59:17.590 --> 59:18.050]  That's cool.
[59:18.150 --> 59:18.790]  So we can go to IHOP.
[59:18.910 --> 59:20.110]  And then the last card we have.
[59:20.110 --> 59:20.910]  We're going to end on.
[59:21.070 --> 59:21.530]  Alright, here we go.
[59:21.550 --> 59:22.610]  It's not a Zimmer.
[59:22.910 --> 59:24.290]  It's not a Billy Ripken fuckface card.
[59:24.290 --> 59:31.930]  But it is a State of Florida Marine Services Bureau officially issued Preston Pennington
[59:31.930 --> 59:34.230]  boating safety certificate.
[59:34.290 --> 59:34.790]  What?
[59:35.390 --> 59:35.890]  Oh!
[59:36.070 --> 59:36.690]  There you go.
[59:37.050 --> 59:37.090]  Oh!
[59:37.450 --> 59:38.470]  Boating certificate?
[59:38.590 --> 59:39.250]  Yeah, boating permit.
[59:40.250 --> 59:42.010]  Gotta have a boating permit in Florida, I guess.
[59:42.430 --> 59:42.570]  Huh.
[59:42.950 --> 59:43.530]  There you go.
[59:43.550 --> 59:44.050]  We did it!
[59:44.690 --> 59:48.990]  Thank you for tuning in to another episode of Face Break Shit.
[59:49.130 --> 59:49.290]  Yup.
[59:50.170 --> 59:50.670]  And...
[59:50.670 --> 59:51.590]  Oh, God.
[59:52.470 --> 59:53.610]  We hope you enjoyed yourself.
[59:53.610 --> 59:53.890]  Yeah.
[59:55.090 --> 59:55.910]  Tune in next time.
[59:56.010 --> 59:57.590]  Don't forget to listen to the podcast.
[59:58.210 --> 59:59.490]  Tell a friend about the podcast.
[01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:00.610]  Tell an enemy.
[01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:01.990]  It's called F*** Face.
[01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:03.350]  It's very hard to search for.
[01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:06.090]  You have to be, like, spell it the right way.
[01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:07.690]  Thank you guys for watching.
[01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:09.910]  We'll do more of these soon, hopefully.
[01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:12.570]  And, Geoff, any final words?
[01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:13.330]  I already stopped.
[01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:13.670]  I'm done.
[01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:14.210]  Oh.
[01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:14.890]  I already turned it off.
[01:00:14.970 --> 01:00:15.210]  I'm done.
[01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:15.330]  Okay.
[01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:15.970]  We can go.
[01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:16.650]  We can go now.
[01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.850]  Bye.
[01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:18.170]  Bye.
