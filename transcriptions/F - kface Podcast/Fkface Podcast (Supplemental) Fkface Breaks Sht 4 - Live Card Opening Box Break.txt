[00:10.620 --> 00:12.360]  Do you have a YMH?
[00:13.720 --> 00:16.860]  Oh, no, that's not good. Hold on. Hold on a second, audience.
[00:17.080 --> 00:19.240]  What? Is this real?
[00:19.280 --> 00:23.200]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of...
[00:24.140 --> 00:26.400]  Face Break Shit! That's right.
[00:26.500 --> 00:30.820]  It's the show where I spend way too much effort putting this table together
[00:30.820 --> 00:36.180]  and way too much of my own personal money buying all this shit, including this lovely pineapple.
[00:36.600 --> 00:39.700]  Because Rooster Teeth didn't pony up for one red cent of any of it.
[00:39.760 --> 00:42.380]  But that's okay. You know, what are you gonna do?
[00:42.920 --> 00:49.580]  With me, as always, barely, barely, barely, is Eric Bedor, our producer extraordinaire.
[00:49.700 --> 00:50.020]  Hi, I'm here.
[00:51.400 --> 00:54.980]  Typically, Gavin is here and sitting in that seat, but if you were here last episode,
[00:55.100 --> 00:56.940]  you will notice that he wasn't here then either.
[00:57.640 --> 01:01.560]  I mean, I guess, sort of, physically he was here,
[01:01.640 --> 01:03.560]  but he certainly wasn't here emotionally or mentally.
[01:03.720 --> 01:04.360]  That was pathetic.
[01:04.360 --> 01:05.880]  And then, yeah, there you go.
[01:07.840 --> 01:14.540]  That was Gavin referring to Britain's attempt at winning the Cup.
[01:14.780 --> 01:15.640]  Bring it home, boys.
[01:16.040 --> 01:20.320]  Then, on a computer screen, TV thing, is Andrew Panton's voice.
[01:20.440 --> 01:21.540]  Somewhere in there, I believe you're there.
[01:21.700 --> 01:22.980]  Yes, that is me.
[01:23.740 --> 01:26.520]  Geoff, you may have spent all the money, but you're gonna get all the profits.
[01:26.600 --> 01:27.500]  You gotta think of it that way.
[01:27.780 --> 01:28.360]  It's true.
[01:28.680 --> 01:32.040]  Think about the value of Shack Attack in 20 years.
[01:32.180 --> 01:32.860]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:32.860 --> 01:34.640]  You did convince me to buy that with my own money.
[01:35.360 --> 01:40.760]  And then, of course, as with every break shit thus far,
[01:42.140 --> 01:46.520]  minor league fan Jack was invited to participate,
[01:46.740 --> 01:48.920]  and then he pulled out at the last minute.
[01:49.040 --> 01:53.380]  I'd also like to point out that he was too ill to perform in this,
[01:53.480 --> 01:56.180]  but I did record a podcast with him less than two hours.
[01:56.180 --> 01:59.400]  I was gonna say, just before you did this, you did a different show with him, right?
[01:59.400 --> 02:00.700]  I did. His show, yeah.
[02:00.700 --> 02:06.240]  He was well enough for his show, but he's now over four online.
[02:06.500 --> 02:09.460]  So that's awesome. Really excited about that.
[02:10.120 --> 02:11.920]  Okay, we got a lot to cover today.
[02:12.340 --> 02:14.760]  I bought way too much shit for us to go through.
[02:15.040 --> 02:15.760]  A lot of nonsense.
[02:16.120 --> 02:18.900]  A couple little house cleaning bits, though, while I have you guys,
[02:19.020 --> 02:24.460]  while your attention is still wrapped before you start to get lost in the sea of cards and cellophane.
[02:25.600 --> 02:27.740]  You heard about the baseball bat fiasco.
[02:27.740 --> 02:34.140]  Well, I have all the pieces assembled here so I can show you the current state of the fuckface baseball bats, right?
[02:34.280 --> 02:34.380]  Wait.
[02:34.780 --> 02:35.300]  Thank you.
[02:35.360 --> 02:35.780]  Yeah, no problem.
[02:35.940 --> 02:38.080]  Here is the full-sized bat.
[02:39.500 --> 02:41.700]  Great. Lovely. I believe I've shown it here before.
[02:41.720 --> 02:42.260]  It's a good-looking bat.
[02:42.280 --> 02:43.360]  Good-looking bat. Solid.
[02:43.880 --> 02:46.640]  You could rip a couple dingers with this guy right here.
[02:46.680 --> 02:52.640]  I can see this guy. I can see the right guy with the right swing doing about 425 on one of these bats.
[02:52.640 --> 02:54.040]  That's nice. 425's pretty good.
[02:54.080 --> 02:55.520]  425's pretty good. Put it on the upper deck.
[02:56.320 --> 03:01.900]  Then we have the pre-made bat knobs, which are great.
[03:02.000 --> 03:02.880]  They say fuckface on them.
[03:03.520 --> 03:05.580]  Sorry, they say bleepface on them. Those are fine.
[03:05.900 --> 03:09.280]  They look good. The way that's etched in and everything looks very good. I like it a lot.
[03:09.500 --> 03:11.900]  Here's the disparity I was talking about in size.
[03:12.180 --> 03:15.040]  See, they're significantly different in size.
[03:15.040 --> 03:16.500]  Can you hold the one knob to the other knob?
[03:17.020 --> 03:17.860]  Yeah, here we go.
[03:18.020 --> 03:19.020]  Knob to knob comparison.
[03:19.380 --> 03:20.480]  That's a great point.
[03:21.640 --> 03:24.860]  This is definitely a baby knob, and this is the daddy knob.
[03:25.880 --> 03:27.240]  There's got to be a better way to say that.
[03:27.400 --> 03:28.640]  Baby knob, mommy knob.
[03:29.140 --> 03:30.000]  Is that better?
[03:31.640 --> 03:34.040]  This knob hasn't hit puberty yet.
[03:34.060 --> 03:34.500]  That's alright.
[03:36.240 --> 03:37.500]  They're both fine, right?
[03:38.300 --> 03:41.620]  If you get one of the knobs that I cut, it's going to be a little bigger than the other one.
[03:42.320 --> 03:43.460]  Here are the metal tags.
[03:44.180 --> 03:46.480]  Zimmer took a fucking nosedive.
[03:47.880 --> 03:49.380]  He's showing off his cute little bear butt.
[03:49.380 --> 03:51.480]  Okay, so here are the little metal tags.
[03:51.520 --> 03:52.100]  These are great.
[03:52.560 --> 03:54.300]  I'm just not sure that they're going to bend over.
[03:54.480 --> 03:58.420]  If I put it on the thing, it's going to cover up the fuckface logo.
[03:59.300 --> 04:03.360]  You have to put it on the side, but even then it's kind of rounded, and I don't know that it's going to...
[04:03.360 --> 04:04.240]  Yeah, I'm afraid.
[04:04.380 --> 04:09.140]  I'll do some testing, but I'm afraid that I will affix 1,000 of these, and then 900 of them are going to pop off.
[04:09.900 --> 04:13.140]  And we don't want to produce a shoddy content, so we're coming up with some solutions.
[04:13.280 --> 04:16.480]  One of the solutions is maybe to take the autographed cards that we had left over,
[04:16.480 --> 04:21.000]  and then some of the cards we pulled from here, maybe put this number on the back of a card,
[04:21.540 --> 04:24.360]  and then throw that in with you, and so that's how you get your serial number.
[04:24.460 --> 04:27.500]  You know it's official, but it's on the back of a card we pulled from here.
[04:27.640 --> 04:36.520]  Maybe we'll do it like all alcoholic stepdad cards, or all dudes that look constipated.
[04:36.620 --> 04:40.480]  We'll just set those aside and make a constipation collection, and then we'll source from there.
[04:40.600 --> 04:41.860]  You can have a constipation card.
[04:42.320 --> 04:43.300]  Yeah, you get a constipation card.
[04:43.460 --> 04:44.960]  Maybe we'll come up with something funnier. I don't know.
[04:45.900 --> 04:48.020]  Maybe we'll do the second idea we think of.
[04:48.140 --> 04:49.960]  Not a lot funnier than constipation, but...
[04:51.240 --> 04:55.780]  I guess to start it off, we typically... well, we'll go for a Zimmer, right? We gotta go for a Zimmer.
[04:55.860 --> 04:56.620]  Yeah, I think so.
[04:56.860 --> 05:01.680]  So we're gonna go with our old standby. We've had a lot of success with 1991 Topps Major League Baseball.
[05:02.020 --> 05:06.440]  Topps in the news a lot lately. They're going through some tough times.
[05:06.440 --> 05:09.320]  They're not gonna be producing MLB cards anymore.
[05:09.460 --> 05:13.560]  Yeah, they lost the license to Major League Baseball for the first time in over 70 years.
[05:13.560 --> 05:15.580]  Now they don't have basketball, they don't have baseball.
[05:15.940 --> 05:23.400]  So, like, your grandpa would be like, I remember before Topps did these cards, and now he remembers a time where they don't do them anymore or ever again.
[05:24.200 --> 05:27.660]  Now, is this a new box of Topps, or is this a continuation?
[05:27.900 --> 05:30.620]  It's a continuation of the one we've been going through since episode one.
[05:31.420 --> 05:37.000]  Here we have Al Newman, Juan Samuel, Steve Farr. Now that...
[05:38.240 --> 05:40.080]  I feel like that's some stepdad energy.
[05:40.080 --> 05:40.740]  Yeah, it's big time.
[05:41.100 --> 05:43.660]  Let me know if anything else steps out.
[05:45.440 --> 05:47.260]  Mike Socha, he was a good player.
[05:47.380 --> 05:48.720]  He's a decent coach, too.
[05:49.940 --> 05:51.740]  He looks like he's yelling at the sun.
[05:52.860 --> 05:53.560]  He's a yeller.
[05:54.280 --> 05:56.940]  Brent Main, Dave Winfield.
[05:57.220 --> 05:58.720]  He was a hell of a player back in the day.
[05:59.020 --> 06:03.940]  Matt Williams, Giants fan. He lived in the shadow of Will Clark, unfortunately, but he was a very good player.
[06:03.940 --> 06:05.240]  Junior Felix.
[06:06.860 --> 06:07.660]  Geoff Gray.
[06:08.780 --> 06:10.680]  We have Tom Treblehorn.
[06:10.680 --> 06:14.100]  I like the way... that's a great name. I really like the way he holds a bat.
[06:14.140 --> 06:15.600]  Good name. We'll figure that out later.
[06:15.920 --> 06:16.740]  Bill Landrum.
[06:19.880 --> 06:20.680]  Ryan Sandberg.
[06:20.880 --> 06:24.040]  Ryan Sandberg was a great, great, great cub.
[06:24.900 --> 06:28.580]  Willie Wilson. Can't say that I'm familiar with, but I like the suggestive butt pose.
[06:28.700 --> 06:29.520]  Let's set that aside.
[06:30.200 --> 06:31.440]  He's a little sassy.
[06:32.060 --> 06:33.300]  And then Darrell Hamilton.
[06:33.580 --> 06:37.580]  No Zims this time, but we did get some fun...
[06:37.580 --> 06:39.680]  I like the stepdad kind of feel to what we got here.
[06:39.680 --> 06:41.140]  I do, too. We got some for the pile.
[06:41.780 --> 06:44.860]  We'll open one more, and then we'll dip into the sack pack.
[06:44.980 --> 06:47.400]  That's good. Pack sack, but that's fine.
[06:47.980 --> 06:49.600]  Pack sack. I said my own thing.
[06:49.940 --> 06:52.920]  Would you be offended if your card didn't have you doing the sport?
[06:53.200 --> 06:54.540]  If you were just lounging on the card?
[06:54.660 --> 06:56.200]  Is that an insult to you?
[06:57.080 --> 06:59.940]  I wonder if you get so many cards made that you're just fine with it.
[06:59.940 --> 07:03.240]  That's a great spin. I have so many cards.
[07:03.420 --> 07:04.460]  We need variation.
[07:04.920 --> 07:05.560]  Keith Comstock.
[07:05.960 --> 07:07.580]  That's a lot of ass.
[07:09.060 --> 07:13.220]  Keith Comstock is the guy that was getting hit in the nuts with that one funny baseball card.
[07:13.500 --> 07:14.620]  Was that him?
[07:15.020 --> 07:15.940]  That's a lot of ass.
[07:16.280 --> 07:17.340]  He's getting hit in the...
[07:18.260 --> 07:22.140]  He's got so much ass because when he got hit in the nuts, it pushed his balls back.
[07:22.780 --> 07:23.980]  So it became a part of his butthole.
[07:24.940 --> 07:25.740]  Brian Harper.
[07:26.000 --> 07:28.220]  He's on base, and he brought the bat with him.
[07:28.220 --> 07:30.780]  It doesn't look like he's ready to swing.
[07:30.900 --> 07:33.660]  Bob Kipper. The Kip, no one called him.
[07:34.200 --> 07:36.900]  Hensley Mullins. He's got a sheepish little grin.
[07:36.920 --> 07:38.600]  He has a little secret.
[07:38.820 --> 07:41.200]  He's like, I'm the little secret boy. Save him.
[07:41.820 --> 07:42.500]  Willie Frazier.
[07:43.000 --> 07:46.920]  I think his secret might be that he's going to be serial number 162.
[07:48.160 --> 07:49.020]  Kip Merker.
[07:49.640 --> 07:50.700]  I remember him.
[07:52.540 --> 07:53.580]  Mike McFarlane.
[07:54.840 --> 07:55.880]  Mike Harkey.
[07:58.100 --> 07:59.060]  Geoff Torborg.
[07:59.320 --> 07:59.700]  Nice.
[08:00.140 --> 08:02.100]  Save all manager cards, obviously.
[08:02.760 --> 08:03.900]  Mike Lacoste.
[08:03.920 --> 08:06.100]  John Smiley. Not so smiley.
[08:06.520 --> 08:07.800]  Rafael Palmero.
[08:08.220 --> 08:10.100]  Great dude. Wade Boggs.
[08:10.360 --> 08:12.220]  Boss Hog himself. Pull that aside.
[08:12.540 --> 08:15.780]  Dale Murphy. That must have been right at the tail end of his career when he was a filly.
[08:16.280 --> 08:18.020]  And Art Howe. Another manager card.
[08:18.080 --> 08:20.540]  So we've got two managers. No Zims, but that's okay.
[08:21.100 --> 08:23.820]  Then let's hop into the pack sack, as we call it.
[08:23.820 --> 08:24.580]  Here it is.
[08:26.340 --> 08:30.740]  As you can see, it's adorned with all of the properties that we love so much.
[08:30.940 --> 08:36.620]  From footballs, to baseballs, to Disney, unicorns.
[08:36.720 --> 08:37.900]  Because we're looking for that 101.
[08:41.580 --> 08:45.420]  Do you think that bag is worth more than $10 at this current time?
[08:45.580 --> 08:47.240]  With the number of packs in there.
[08:47.320 --> 08:50.580]  Well, just the effort and the work that I put into it alone.
[08:50.680 --> 08:51.980]  The craftsmanship and the artisanship.
[08:51.980 --> 08:52.940]  Oh, absolutely.
[08:53.860 --> 08:57.880]  Pack sack delivered us a pack of eight Super Gloffs.
[08:58.480 --> 09:02.540]  New kids on the block. This is One Direction before One Direction.
[09:03.300 --> 09:03.980]  NKOTB.
[09:05.500 --> 09:08.640]  This is a pre-NSYNC.
[09:09.440 --> 09:09.860]  The other one.
[09:12.760 --> 09:14.300]  Joey, that's cool.
[09:15.420 --> 09:16.380]  I'm a Jordan guy myself.
[09:16.620 --> 09:17.780]  This is a sticker.
[09:18.220 --> 09:19.080]  Oh, wow!
[09:20.880 --> 09:22.320]  Here we have... I remember that dude.
[09:23.360 --> 09:24.400]  Yeah, dancing.
[09:25.120 --> 09:27.660]  Then we have the whole crew.
[09:28.380 --> 09:28.980]  Where's Donnie?
[09:29.640 --> 09:30.340]  Donnie's right there.
[09:31.080 --> 09:33.880]  He's like, pretty soon, my little brother is going to eclipse me.
[09:34.060 --> 09:35.740]  You won't hear about me for another 30 years again.
[09:36.580 --> 09:39.260]  Then I'll get real skinny and I'll shoot a...
[09:39.260 --> 09:40.800]  teacher? Is that what he was? A doctor?
[09:41.040 --> 09:41.420]  What?
[09:41.680 --> 09:42.700]  What was he in the Sixth Sense?
[09:44.380 --> 09:45.180]  Donnie Wahlberg?
[09:45.320 --> 09:46.860]  Donnie Wahlberg was in Sixth Sense?
[09:46.860 --> 09:48.500]  Yeah, he's the one that killed What's-His-Face at the beginning.
[09:48.900 --> 09:51.000]  I haven't seen the movie, so I can't argue with you.
[09:51.200 --> 09:51.320]  Bruce Willis.
[09:51.320 --> 09:52.260]  I didn't know he was in that.
[09:52.400 --> 09:53.720]  What did Bruce Willis do?
[09:54.200 --> 09:56.000]  Wasn't he a therapist or something?
[09:56.140 --> 09:56.760]  Therapist, yeah.
[09:58.500 --> 09:59.820]  I thought he was a cop.
[10:00.880 --> 10:02.320]  I thought he was a therapist. Was he a cop?
[10:02.440 --> 10:04.700]  Maybe he was a forensic therapist.
[10:04.860 --> 10:06.440]  Wait, so you're just guessing?
[10:07.140 --> 10:08.860]  Yeah, I just assumed he was a cop.
[10:09.080 --> 10:09.500]  I don't know.
[10:10.420 --> 10:11.280]  I haven't seen it.
[10:11.800 --> 10:14.420]  You've got the right stuff, Andrew.
[10:15.180 --> 10:17.020]  Millie texted me, let me make sure.
[10:19.780 --> 10:21.520]  Gracie, are these cards doing anything for you?
[10:22.600 --> 10:23.760]  No, I didn't think so.
[10:24.580 --> 10:26.660]  What about that? What about Donnie?
[10:26.700 --> 10:27.800]  That's a hit if I've ever seen one.
[10:27.820 --> 10:28.860]  That's a Wahlberg right there.
[10:28.960 --> 10:29.600]  Look at that bling.
[10:30.380 --> 10:31.600]  That's Mark Wahlberg's brother.
[10:32.020 --> 10:34.180]  When you see that guy, you think Berger.
[10:34.440 --> 10:37.260]  You think Berger. You think Wahlberger.
[10:37.580 --> 10:41.020]  I hate that he's sort of the celebrity mascot of the Celtics.
[10:41.260 --> 10:42.520]  Just because of his availability?
[10:42.520 --> 10:43.680]  He's at all the games.
[10:44.120 --> 10:48.120]  Just due to sheer availability, he's the mascot of the Celtics.
[10:49.160 --> 10:53.120]  He's famous enough to be there, but not famous enough to be Superman.
[10:53.660 --> 10:55.620]  He's on a show, but...
[10:55.620 --> 11:02.900]  Celtics get so many great court-side celebrities, like Donnie Wahlberg and Dave Portnoy.
[11:03.680 --> 11:04.740]  Oh, boy.
[11:05.120 --> 11:08.740]  But if I was going to pick between those two, I think I'd pick Donnie Wahlberg.
[11:08.760 --> 11:10.720]  Oh, absolutely. You're going Wahlberg.
[11:11.360 --> 11:15.100]  All right, so we got a little bit of... those are both kind of old, so let's get a little newer.
[11:15.380 --> 11:18.040]  I had some success. If you don't know, I've been doing this show called...
[11:19.500 --> 11:22.860]  I've been doing this show called The Daily Rip on Instagram.
[11:23.100 --> 11:24.160]  Let's get the lower third for that.
[11:24.380 --> 11:25.700]  We know what Instagram is.
[11:26.300 --> 11:27.960]  Daily Card Breaks on Instagram.
[11:29.020 --> 11:30.540]  Fuckface.com slash...
[11:31.400 --> 11:33.000]  Instagram.com slash fuckfacepod.
[11:33.180 --> 11:36.060]  The other day, I did a pack of Topps Team USA Olympics.
[11:36.580 --> 11:38.220]  And I got an autograph out of it.
[11:38.220 --> 11:39.120]  Yeah, I got an autograph.
[11:40.000 --> 11:40.560]  Who was it?
[11:40.700 --> 11:43.960]  Some dude. It was a US 3-on-3 basketball player.
[11:44.080 --> 11:44.740]  Some dude?
[11:44.780 --> 11:45.920]  Don't remember his name.
[11:46.020 --> 11:46.980]  Wait, 3-on-3?
[11:47.220 --> 11:48.840]  Yeah, 3-on-3 basketball. It's an Olympic sport.
[11:49.520 --> 11:51.560]  3-on-3 basketball is an Olympic sport?
[11:51.560 --> 11:53.280]  It's like NBA Jam, the sport.
[11:54.100 --> 11:55.800]  3-on-3 basketball is an Olympic sport?
[11:55.940 --> 11:56.640]  Is it full court?
[11:57.800 --> 11:58.780]  3-on-3...
[11:58.780 --> 12:00.860]  No, it's half court. I'm sorry, it's half court. But it's half court, 3-on-3.
[12:02.080 --> 12:04.680]  It's also not very fun to watch. I watched it.
[12:04.680 --> 12:08.140]  If you want to watch, six dudes miss a lot of shots.
[12:10.340 --> 12:11.900]  Anyway, here we go. Jessica Beard.
[12:12.760 --> 12:17.060]  We've got Sakura Kokumai. I was really excited about it until I watched it.
[12:17.380 --> 12:19.440]  Kathleen Baker. That's a cool card.
[12:20.020 --> 12:22.760]  Robbie Hummel. Oh, that might be the dude.
[12:23.300 --> 12:24.960]  I think Robbie Hummel was the guy.
[12:25.200 --> 12:26.880]  You have his autograph?
[12:26.960 --> 12:28.120]  I have his autograph, 3-on-3 basketball.
[12:28.120 --> 12:33.820]  Wow, Robbie. Why is he standing like that? You have to show the audience. Why is he standing like that?
[12:33.820 --> 12:34.860]  Because he's constipated.
[12:35.020 --> 12:35.360]  Oh, no.
[12:35.760 --> 12:36.600]  Or he's got a big butt.
[12:36.680 --> 12:37.280]  Oh, no.
[12:37.700 --> 12:41.120]  Will London III. You can see how fast he's going in the card.
[12:41.440 --> 12:43.540]  Look at that. The background can't be captured.
[12:43.680 --> 12:44.120]  It's incredible.
[12:45.260 --> 12:50.780]  Here's Daryl Homer. He's a fencer, and he's also apparently going very fast while fencing sideways.
[12:51.760 --> 12:54.460]  Then we have David Boudia.
[12:55.160 --> 12:56.560]  Maybe. Maybe that's how you say it.
[12:58.220 --> 13:02.580]  Whoa, look at the guns on Maggie Steffens, the water polo player.
[13:02.580 --> 13:06.780]  This looks like an actual photo, or that's art?
[13:06.960 --> 13:07.920]  No, it's a drawing.
[13:08.400 --> 13:11.400]  I think Andrew's right. I think that's a drawing.
[13:11.520 --> 13:12.060]  I think that's a drawing.
[13:13.100 --> 13:14.440]  It seemed like you weren't sure.
[13:16.400 --> 13:21.920]  Did I mix up the hits? No, I just forgot to put Tom Troublehorn in with the hits.
[13:22.060 --> 13:22.540]  What's wrong with me?
[13:22.640 --> 13:23.000]  Terrible.
[13:23.180 --> 13:23.500]  Manager.
[13:24.900 --> 13:28.220]  What do you guys want to go to next? Let me read off some of the stuff we have.
[13:28.260 --> 13:28.500]  Okay.
[13:28.500 --> 13:35.040]  We have Topps Soccer. We have Game of Thrones. We have Panini Prism Draft Picks NFL. I want to open last.
[13:35.240 --> 13:38.300]  We have a surprise coming later. We have some Umbrella Academy left.
[13:38.560 --> 13:42.020]  We have a bunch of singles. We have Topps Gypsy Queen. We have Topps Finest Football.
[13:42.820 --> 13:44.880]  Let's do Wrasslin'. You're a wrassle boy.
[13:45.240 --> 13:47.460]  As long as it's not Umbrella Academy, I'm into anything.
[13:48.280 --> 13:50.820]  I'm so done with the Umbrella Academy cards, you have no idea.
[13:50.900 --> 13:51.740]  You're so over the Umbrella Academy cards.
[13:52.040 --> 13:55.340]  They are the least interesting cards we have opened. I don't get it.
[13:55.460 --> 13:57.480]  They're not the prettiest cards.
[13:57.480 --> 14:00.220]  No, they're just like screen grabs from a Netflix show.
[14:00.540 --> 14:02.640]  Don't forget to put one in the sack pack or whatever.
[14:04.520 --> 14:05.820]  I have a question for you, Eric.
[14:06.480 --> 14:10.940]  We were recently talking about wrestling appearances on reality shows.
[14:11.000 --> 14:12.840]  You sent me the weakest link. I watched those.
[14:13.540 --> 14:18.080]  Everybody was scared to vote out Steve Austin, even though he was very clearly the weakest link.
[14:18.180 --> 14:19.880]  He lasted like four rounds beyond what he should.
[14:20.100 --> 14:23.260]  Who is the Steve Austin of this era, of this pack?
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.080]  Oh, I don't know. I'm not sure that there's anyone like Steve Austin.
[14:27.080 --> 14:29.960]  I don't know if there's anyone like Stone Cold Steve Austin.
[14:30.380 --> 14:33.940]  You look in your beady eyes, drop you on that stack of dimes you call a neck.
[14:34.340 --> 14:36.320]  You dumb son of a bitch.
[14:36.600 --> 14:38.280]  I don't think anyone's doing that.
[14:38.400 --> 14:39.180]  Is that Steve Austin?
[14:39.180 --> 14:41.780]  Yeah, man. That's how Steve Austin sounds.
[14:42.060 --> 14:43.800]  That's how Steve Austin sounds. I did great.
[14:43.980 --> 14:44.580]  Good job.
[14:45.140 --> 14:46.780]  Well, I don't know who this dude is.
[14:46.980 --> 14:47.760]  That's Kyle O'Reilly.
[14:47.840 --> 14:49.120]  That is a sexy little pose.
[14:49.700 --> 14:50.840]  He's feeling sassy.
[14:51.100 --> 14:55.460]  He has a world title match at the next NXT pay-per-view.
[14:55.460 --> 14:58.220]  It's a WWE brand, like Raw and SmackDown. It's called NXT.
[14:58.660 --> 14:59.800]  So he has a title match soon.
[14:59.920 --> 15:02.460]  He's got some alluring cross-shaved legs.
[15:02.520 --> 15:03.080]  Very nice.
[15:03.240 --> 15:03.920]  Showing off his gams.
[15:04.480 --> 15:05.980]  Ooh, Daniel Bryan.
[15:06.080 --> 15:08.920]  So he might be showing up in another company called AEW.
[15:09.120 --> 15:09.460]  Oh, really?
[15:09.680 --> 15:10.360]  Very, very soon, yeah.
[15:10.520 --> 15:13.500]  The rumor is that he signed a contract with them and he'll be there as Bryan Danielson.
[15:13.880 --> 15:15.820]  Speaking of people signed to AEW,
[15:16.820 --> 15:20.580]  Alistair Black, former Alistair Black, now Malachi Black in AEW.
[15:21.140 --> 15:23.680]  He's the top merchandise mover in AEW.
[15:23.680 --> 15:27.500]  He came in and kicked Cody Rhodes so hard in the face that he was going to retire.
[15:28.280 --> 15:28.500]  Really?
[15:28.600 --> 15:30.160]  He kicked him so hard in the face.
[15:30.280 --> 15:32.060]  Cody's like, I'm just going to... I don't want to do this anymore.
[15:33.020 --> 15:33.380]  Really?
[15:33.880 --> 15:34.400]  Yeah, it was awesome.
[15:35.040 --> 15:36.460]  Wow, that's a big kick, huh?
[15:36.580 --> 15:39.780]  And then John Morrison, former Johnny Nitro.
[15:40.020 --> 15:40.960]  From Survivor.
[15:41.000 --> 15:42.080]  From Survivor.
[15:42.580 --> 15:43.520]  That's a Survivor guy.
[15:43.540 --> 15:48.720]  Oh shit, is this the guy from season 37 of Survivor?
[15:49.360 --> 15:51.260]  He was a big reality TV guy.
[15:51.360 --> 15:52.560]  He was on the indies for a while.
[15:52.560 --> 15:53.380]  He was in WWE.
[15:53.600 --> 15:54.460]  They kind of didn't do anything.
[15:54.540 --> 15:55.480]  He's like, I don't want to do this.
[15:55.560 --> 15:59.740]  He left, started making a name for himself on a bunch of reality stuff.
[16:01.280 --> 16:03.000]  He's back in WWE now.
[16:04.020 --> 16:05.440]  I fucking love this dude.
[16:05.700 --> 16:06.180]  What'd he say?
[16:07.140 --> 16:07.500]  Brochachos.
[16:08.220 --> 16:08.840]  Brochachos, yeah.
[16:09.260 --> 16:10.060]  He was the Brochachos dude.
[16:10.100 --> 16:15.100]  He got voted off early and then he became entertaining throughout the whole season just with those little one-liners.
[16:15.220 --> 16:15.500]  There you go.
[16:15.660 --> 16:16.720]  Yeah, he was great.
[16:16.980 --> 16:20.860]  Yeah, he's a great wrestler and he's like...
[16:20.860 --> 16:22.220]  Man, I think he just turned 40?
[16:22.220 --> 16:25.400]  Which is like insane because he's like shredded to the gills.
[16:25.520 --> 16:26.060]  It's insane.
[16:26.260 --> 16:27.000]  Well, I'm 46.
[16:29.220 --> 16:30.280]  That's just a fact.
[16:30.760 --> 16:32.680]  I guess if we're just saying stuff...
[16:32.680 --> 16:34.840]  While we're talking about being shredded to the gills, I mean...
[16:34.840 --> 16:35.520]  I guess we're just saying shit.
[16:35.520 --> 16:36.100]  I'm staying right here.
[16:36.480 --> 16:37.240]  Dakota Kai.
[16:37.940 --> 16:41.980]  She has a world title match as well at the next NXT pay-per-view.
[16:42.460 --> 16:43.760]  Big fan of Dakota Kai.
[16:43.820 --> 16:44.500]  I think she's great.
[16:44.960 --> 16:45.200]  Okay.
[16:45.580 --> 16:46.620]  Way to go, Dakota Kai.
[16:46.920 --> 16:47.960]  She's from New Zealand.
[16:48.240 --> 16:48.660]  Oh.
[16:48.720 --> 16:49.880]  So that's very cool.
[16:49.980 --> 16:50.500]  Good on ya.
[16:50.500 --> 16:52.240]  Hey, there you go.
[16:52.480 --> 16:55.360]  Sheamus, he's the United States champion in WWE, I think.
[16:55.780 --> 16:57.540]  He's a big ol' Irish guy.
[16:57.600 --> 17:00.540]  This is who Jack dreams he is when it goes to Batman.
[17:01.080 --> 17:01.580]  He has...
[17:01.580 --> 17:03.360]  It should have turned out like this for me.
[17:03.600 --> 17:03.840]  Yeah.
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.720]  Full head of beefy ginger hair and some pecs.
[17:07.840 --> 17:08.640]  He's huge.
[17:08.960 --> 17:09.180]  Yeah.
[17:09.700 --> 17:11.320]  Is that guy Occam or Razor?
[17:11.440 --> 17:12.080]  That's Razor, dude.
[17:12.080 --> 17:13.500]  Yeah, he's not in WWE anymore.
[17:13.600 --> 17:13.780]  He left.
[17:13.900 --> 17:14.800]  Oh, where'd he go?
[17:14.940 --> 17:15.540]  I don't know.
[17:15.600 --> 17:16.200]  I think he got fired.
[17:16.580 --> 17:17.980]  And then Bobby Lashley.
[17:18.460 --> 17:20.560]  He's the current World Heavyweight Champion.
[17:20.800 --> 17:24.180]  And he has a match against Goldberg at SummerSlam.
[17:24.640 --> 17:26.040]  Remember Goldberg from 1999?
[17:26.700 --> 17:27.120]  Goldberg.
[17:27.500 --> 17:29.080]  Goldberg from WCW.
[17:29.320 --> 17:29.760]  Bill...
[17:29.760 --> 17:30.500]  Bill Goldberg.
[17:30.540 --> 17:31.160]  Bill Goldberg.
[17:31.620 --> 17:33.680]  Wasn't he an action star for a while or something?
[17:33.680 --> 17:34.800]  I think he was in like a couple...
[17:34.800 --> 17:35.080]  He did like The Untouchables or something?
[17:35.100 --> 17:36.420]  Yeah, he was in like a couple of movies.
[17:37.260 --> 17:38.780]  He was in The Longest Yard.
[17:39.100 --> 17:40.240]  He was in The Longest Yard.
[17:40.780 --> 17:41.020]  He was.
[17:41.080 --> 17:42.120]  I don't know of any other movies.
[17:42.340 --> 17:42.720]  Oh!
[17:47.520 --> 17:47.960]  Robert...
[17:48.740 --> 17:50.000]  Now he's on SmackDown.
[17:50.080 --> 17:50.760]  Is that The Miz?
[17:50.880 --> 17:51.300]  I can't see.
[17:51.440 --> 17:52.180]  This is The Miz.
[17:52.220 --> 17:53.600]  He's another reality TV star.
[17:53.620 --> 17:54.080]  He is.
[17:54.260 --> 17:56.520]  He's from Back to New York.
[17:57.160 --> 17:59.060]  MTV's Real World Season 10.
[17:59.300 --> 18:00.160]  It looks like he got started.
[18:00.340 --> 18:01.880]  It looks like he's fighting a Marvel character.
[18:02.520 --> 18:04.380]  I can't see who that is, but...
[18:04.380 --> 18:05.520]  Definitely is an X-Men costume.
[18:05.660 --> 18:05.840]  Whoa.
[18:06.000 --> 18:06.820]  Oh, Shinsuke Nakamura.
[18:07.400 --> 18:08.020]  Or maybe Ant-Man.
[18:08.280 --> 18:08.460]  Okay.
[18:08.680 --> 18:10.180]  Is that Carmella?
[18:10.780 --> 18:11.140]  Carmella.
[18:11.260 --> 18:11.820]  Yeah, she's...
[18:11.820 --> 18:14.320]  Oh, Carmella like Soprano?
[18:14.440 --> 18:14.800]  That's...
[18:14.800 --> 18:16.040]  I think that's where the name comes from, yeah.
[18:16.180 --> 18:16.640]  Oh, okay.
[18:16.640 --> 18:18.480]  But she's not related to The Sopranos.
[18:18.560 --> 18:20.060]  That's a fictitious television program.
[18:20.380 --> 18:23.900]  And that is the phenomenal A.J. Styles.
[18:25.020 --> 18:28.160]  He's one of the... one half of the world tag team champions on Raw.
[18:28.700 --> 18:30.180]  He's been doing it a long time.
[18:30.240 --> 18:33.440]  I used to watch that guy in a Jewish community center in Los Angeles, in Los Feliz.
[18:33.780 --> 18:34.060]  Really?
[18:34.180 --> 18:34.460]  Oh, yeah.
[18:34.560 --> 18:35.340]  In like 2004.
[18:35.980 --> 18:38.780]  I watched him wrestle like 60 minutes in front of like 30 people.
[18:39.400 --> 18:39.920]  It was pretty cool.
[18:40.440 --> 18:41.120]  And these people?
[18:41.540 --> 18:42.520]  This is Bianca...
[18:42.520 --> 18:43.220]  Bianca Belair.
[18:43.360 --> 18:45.080]  She's the SmackDown Women's Champion.
[18:45.080 --> 18:48.620]  She has a match at SummerSlam against Sasha Banks.
[18:48.780 --> 18:54.040]  She looks like she is wrist deep in this lady's mouth and vagina at the same time.
[18:54.220 --> 18:55.500]  Well, I... I'm not saying. I'm just saying.
[18:55.860 --> 18:56.340]  Good Lord.
[18:56.500 --> 18:56.680]  Yep.
[18:56.840 --> 18:57.240]  It's aggressive.
[18:57.560 --> 18:58.640]  Everyone needs a finishing move.
[19:01.080 --> 19:03.920]  Former WWE star Andrade Cien Almas.
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.080]  Now Andrade El Idolo in AEW.
[19:07.380 --> 19:09.080]  And Triple A on Mexico.
[19:09.780 --> 19:11.280]  So, he's international.
[19:11.580 --> 19:13.780]  I love when you are in your zone.
[19:13.820 --> 19:14.740]  Oh, this is...
[19:14.740 --> 19:16.880]  This is so fun to watch.
[19:16.980 --> 19:17.840]  Who's... I can't see.
[19:17.840 --> 19:18.500]  That's Kay Lee Ray, man.
[19:18.660 --> 19:22.460]  Oh, longest reigning NXT UK Women's Champion.
[19:22.900 --> 19:23.480]  Kay Lee Ray.
[19:23.540 --> 19:23.960]  That's a thing.
[19:24.140 --> 19:24.260]  Yeah.
[19:24.980 --> 19:27.260]  And very red... I assume Scarlett?
[19:27.400 --> 19:27.740]  Yeah.
[19:27.780 --> 19:28.820]  Living up to the name.
[19:29.400 --> 19:33.220]  Scarlett, who I think is probably just getting called up to Raw to be with Karrion Kross.
[19:33.360 --> 19:35.080]  Is she... does she paint herself red?
[19:35.180 --> 19:36.720]  No, we've actually seen her live.
[19:37.120 --> 19:37.460]  We have?
[19:37.720 --> 19:40.640]  We went to a show called Wrestle Circus.
[19:40.840 --> 19:41.080]  Yeah.
[19:41.080 --> 19:44.280]  She wrestled with a guy named Retro Anthony Green.
[19:44.780 --> 19:47.600]  She was a tag team partner with him.
[19:47.640 --> 19:48.820]  We've seen her live.
[19:48.980 --> 19:49.840]  You're not going to remember.
[19:50.060 --> 19:50.420]  Was she red?
[19:50.780 --> 19:51.140]  No.
[19:51.360 --> 19:53.940]  That is just a colored lighting that is hitting her.
[19:54.080 --> 19:54.860]  So, it's different.
[19:55.200 --> 19:55.920]  It's different.
[19:56.020 --> 19:56.740]  Because her name is Scarlett.
[19:56.780 --> 19:56.940]  Yeah.
[19:57.100 --> 19:57.900]  Is that R-Truth?
[19:58.440 --> 19:58.720]  Yeah.
[19:58.780 --> 20:00.860]  This guy has been wrestling since the 90s.
[20:00.980 --> 20:02.520]  He's absolutely jacked.
[20:02.540 --> 20:03.460]  He has a rap career.
[20:03.580 --> 20:04.180]  He's awesome.
[20:04.440 --> 20:08.140]  He used to go by the name Kay Quick, former TNA World Heavyweight Champion.
[20:08.140 --> 20:10.820]  Man, those shorts look like he bought them in the 90s.
[20:11.180 --> 20:13.840]  He wears the pin anywhere belt, right?
[20:13.980 --> 20:15.640]  Yeah, 24-7 championship.
[20:15.720 --> 20:16.720]  Yeah, I love that.
[20:17.000 --> 20:17.840]  Alexa Bliss.
[20:18.660 --> 20:20.500]  She's got a match at SummerSlam.
[20:20.640 --> 20:24.620]  She also has a song from Bowling for Soup about her titled Alexa Bliss.
[20:25.340 --> 20:25.760]  Really?
[20:25.860 --> 20:26.020]  Yeah.
[20:26.840 --> 20:27.940]  The Bowling for Soup.
[20:28.240 --> 20:31.700]  Adam Cole has a contract dispute with WWE.
[20:31.880 --> 20:33.300]  Currently might be going to AEW.
[20:33.560 --> 20:37.780]  But they're going to offer him a lot of money to stay because that guy is a star anywhere he goes.
[20:37.780 --> 20:38.060]  Really?
[20:38.460 --> 20:39.280]  Gigantic head.
[20:39.520 --> 20:40.620]  He has a huge head.
[20:40.740 --> 20:40.920]  What size?
[20:41.020 --> 20:41.620]  His head is huge.
[20:41.740 --> 20:42.760]  It's like Bernie's size.
[20:42.860 --> 20:43.300]  Remember that guy?
[20:43.380 --> 20:45.580]  That's not a human-sized head.
[20:45.800 --> 20:46.340]  Do you remember Bernie?
[20:46.520 --> 20:46.840]  I do.
[20:47.160 --> 20:47.600]  Occasionally.
[20:47.700 --> 20:49.260]  I remember watching him trying to fit through doors.
[20:50.100 --> 20:50.800]  This is Kushida.
[20:50.980 --> 20:51.420]  Kushida.
[20:51.740 --> 20:56.280]  Former New Japan Pro Wrestling IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion.
[20:56.280 --> 20:58.960]  Now the NXT Cruiserweight Champion.
[20:59.040 --> 20:59.980]  What does IWGP stand for?
[21:00.400 --> 21:01.960]  International Wrestling Grand Prix.
[21:02.580 --> 21:04.940]  That is what they call New Japan in Japan.
[21:05.220 --> 21:05.440]  Oh.
[21:05.680 --> 21:05.820]  Yep.
[21:06.840 --> 21:07.240]  Oh.
[21:07.760 --> 21:08.480]  Kevin Owens.
[21:08.600 --> 21:11.100]  Former Kevin Steen on the independent scene.
[21:11.220 --> 21:13.080]  That guy wrestled in front of like 30 people also.
[21:13.260 --> 21:15.060]  I love Kevin Owens.
[21:15.240 --> 21:16.800]  He is one of the best.
[21:16.960 --> 21:17.180]  He's a refractor.
[21:17.240 --> 21:17.720]  One of the best.
[21:18.040 --> 21:19.200]  Oh, and then here we have...
[21:19.200 --> 21:19.880]  Is that Liv Morgan?
[21:20.000 --> 21:20.480]  Liv Morgan.
[21:20.580 --> 21:21.980]  From New Jersey.
[21:22.180 --> 21:22.820]  She is...
[21:24.900 --> 21:32.040]  Should have gotten more of a shot at the Women's Championship from, I think, the Money in the Bank Ladder match,
[21:32.120 --> 21:33.700]  but did not pull the trigger on it.
[21:33.740 --> 21:34.160]  That's okay.
[21:34.380 --> 21:34.780]  That's okay.
[21:34.780 --> 21:35.580]  It is what it is.
[21:35.620 --> 21:36.740]  I'm glad we got to open it up.
[21:36.900 --> 21:42.480]  I'm going to say for the one pack we threw, we donated to the pack sack, which as you might know,
[21:42.560 --> 21:46.420]  whenever you remove a pack from the pack sack, you have to replenish it with an offering.
[21:46.860 --> 21:47.080]  That's true.
[21:48.080 --> 21:49.860]  Moving along, I have had my...
[21:49.860 --> 21:50.380]  Oh, actually.
[21:52.300 --> 21:56.540]  Speaking of recent hits, we...
[21:56.540 --> 22:01.560]  Yesterday, as a matter of fact, I opened up, without a lot of fanfare, without a lot of excitement,
[22:01.560 --> 22:09.420]  I opened up a pack of Beanie Babies, Series 4, and got a Blue Ice Chrome Waddle the Penguin Refractor.
[22:09.480 --> 22:10.940]  Where's the line for you?
[22:11.180 --> 22:14.900]  Like, where do you go, this is too far, I don't collect this?
[22:15.000 --> 22:15.680]  I haven't gotten there yet.
[22:15.720 --> 22:16.280]  Oh, boy.
[22:16.480 --> 22:17.840]  But we'll find out.
[22:17.940 --> 22:18.220]  Okay.
[22:19.520 --> 22:21.740]  So, I've got some Series 3.
[22:21.840 --> 22:24.080]  I want to pop these suckers open and see if we get lucky again.
[22:24.220 --> 22:24.620]  Let's do it.
[22:24.640 --> 22:25.000]  Here we go.
[22:25.720 --> 22:26.840]  This is Whisper.
[22:27.060 --> 22:27.680]  She's a deer.
[22:27.960 --> 22:28.800]  Whisper is a deer.
[22:29.440 --> 22:29.880]  Okay.
[22:30.820 --> 22:31.800]  Then we have...
[22:32.320 --> 22:32.460]  Dobby?
[22:33.080 --> 22:34.180]  Dobby, the house elf.
[22:34.460 --> 22:35.660]  There's Dobby, the house elf.
[22:35.680 --> 22:36.280]  A little house elf.
[22:36.680 --> 22:37.480]  It's a dog.
[22:37.640 --> 22:38.660]  Getting ready to do his chores.
[22:39.540 --> 22:40.640]  Then we have Puffer.
[22:40.920 --> 22:42.080]  Ooh, Puffer.
[22:42.780 --> 22:43.300]  Pretty good one.
[22:43.680 --> 22:44.220]  And then Pingu.
[22:44.640 --> 22:45.460]  I think it's Ringo.
[22:45.740 --> 22:45.920]  Ringo.
[22:46.280 --> 22:48.160]  Cool, pretty cool how you said that.
[22:48.300 --> 22:48.800]  And Jabber.
[22:50.100 --> 22:50.420]  Okay.
[22:50.640 --> 22:51.800]  He's a cute little, like a...
[22:52.320 --> 22:52.760]  Parrot?
[22:52.840 --> 22:54.020]  Parrot or a parakeet or something.
[22:54.160 --> 22:54.400]  Parrot?
[22:54.680 --> 22:57.080]  And then, oh, shit.
[22:57.460 --> 23:02.960]  Not only is this Rainbow some sort of a salamander or a gecko, Rainbow is an artist-proof...
[23:02.960 --> 23:03.460]  It's a chameleon.
[23:03.660 --> 23:04.020]  Chameleon.
[23:04.160 --> 23:04.280]  See?
[23:07.020 --> 23:08.080]  Salamander or gecko.
[23:08.080 --> 23:08.620]  I don't know.
[23:08.720 --> 23:09.320]  Is it a chameleon?
[23:09.620 --> 23:10.140]  Yeah, it is.
[23:10.260 --> 23:10.700]  It's kind of a chameleon.
[23:10.860 --> 23:12.800]  Well, not everybody calls it Beanie Babies as much as...
[23:12.800 --> 23:12.820]  Right, right.
[23:12.820 --> 23:14.840]  It's the lizard that changes color.
[23:15.280 --> 23:16.640]  This guy knows two things.
[23:16.680 --> 23:18.240]  He knows wrestling and he knows Beanie Babies.
[23:18.260 --> 23:21.680]  No, I just know about a lizard that changes color and there's only one of those.
[23:21.700 --> 23:22.600]  I'll tell you what color it is.
[23:22.660 --> 23:23.900]  It's the color of artist-proof.
[23:23.940 --> 23:24.740]  That's a hit.
[23:25.340 --> 23:25.700]  Touching.
[23:26.080 --> 23:26.520]  We'll open.
[23:26.520 --> 23:28.180]  No, this feels good.
[23:28.180 --> 23:28.800]  I'm going to open it now.
[23:28.940 --> 23:29.020]  Okay.
[23:29.560 --> 23:30.140]  Let's do it.
[23:30.680 --> 23:31.340]  Let's feel good.
[23:31.400 --> 23:32.280]  Feels like a solid pack.
[23:32.400 --> 23:32.920]  Okay, this one.
[23:32.980 --> 23:34.060]  Andrew, do you think this is going to be a good one?
[23:34.980 --> 23:36.400]  I'm expecting at least two hits.
[23:36.520 --> 23:37.100]  Maybe an auto.
[23:37.400 --> 23:39.420]  I'm hoping for a puffer auto.
[23:39.780 --> 23:40.680]  Ooh, that's going to be good.
[23:41.180 --> 23:42.280]  Oh, we have another artist-proof.
[23:42.480 --> 23:43.980]  This is...
[23:44.520 --> 23:45.260]  Oh, shit.
[23:45.680 --> 23:45.940]  What?
[23:46.120 --> 23:46.440]  Oh.
[23:47.380 --> 23:47.720]  Oh.
[23:48.000 --> 23:48.660]  Oh, never mind.
[23:48.860 --> 23:50.160]  Okay, this is...
[23:50.160 --> 23:50.900]  Are you okay?
[23:51.100 --> 23:51.520]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[23:51.520 --> 23:51.820]  What happened?
[23:51.820 --> 23:52.320]  You'll see, you'll see.
[23:52.360 --> 23:53.100]  Well, this is Rome.
[23:53.700 --> 23:54.400]  This is a...
[23:54.400 --> 23:54.940]  What is Rome?
[23:55.060 --> 23:55.520]  Oh, like a buffalo.
[23:55.520 --> 23:56.300]  This is a buffalo.
[23:56.540 --> 23:57.140]  It's where he roams.
[23:57.760 --> 23:59.800]  And this is artist-proof as well, so that's a huge hit.
[24:00.300 --> 24:00.540]  Huge.
[24:01.200 --> 24:03.160]  And then this is what I got excited about.
[24:04.100 --> 24:04.460]  Boom!
[24:06.440 --> 24:10.200]  I got Gucci the tie-dye jellyfish.
[24:10.740 --> 24:13.400]  And it's some sort of a refractor.
[24:13.660 --> 24:14.120]  Look at that.
[24:14.160 --> 24:15.320]  It looks like he's underwater.
[24:15.760 --> 24:16.800]  Oh, that's so cool.
[24:17.000 --> 24:17.100]  Okay.
[24:18.520 --> 24:21.460]  And then I can tell I'm the only one on Earth excited about these.
[24:21.620 --> 24:22.540]  Then there's that one.
[24:22.540 --> 24:23.820]  Is his name just Luke?
[24:24.240 --> 24:24.820]  Yeah, that's Luke.
[24:27.460 --> 24:29.540]  It's Luke the Labrador Retriever.
[24:29.860 --> 24:30.260]  Luke.
[24:30.440 --> 24:32.760]  This is Cheeks the Baboon.
[24:32.960 --> 24:34.900]  Oh, that's cool because it's a mouse.
[24:34.960 --> 24:35.760]  Oh, this one's good.
[24:36.260 --> 24:36.660]  Seaweed.
[24:36.880 --> 24:37.380]  Are those Christmas trees?
[24:37.920 --> 24:38.160]  Where?
[24:38.280 --> 24:39.560]  In the bottom left, what are those?
[24:39.720 --> 24:39.880]  Where?
[24:40.740 --> 24:41.680]  In the go-back-a-card.
[24:42.060 --> 24:42.920]  What is that?
[24:43.020 --> 24:43.700]  Are those flowers?
[24:43.880 --> 24:44.360]  These are flowers.
[24:45.040 --> 24:45.360]  Okay.
[24:45.480 --> 24:46.920]  That would have been cool if they were Christmas trees.
[24:47.200 --> 24:47.880]  Here's seaweed.
[24:48.440 --> 24:48.820]  Uh-huh.
[24:49.200 --> 24:50.160]  Here's rainbow again.
[24:50.240 --> 24:51.740]  You can see this one's not artist-proof.
[24:51.740 --> 24:53.540]  Yeah, you can see this one fucking sucks.
[24:53.640 --> 24:54.540]  This is just the base card.
[24:54.560 --> 24:55.420]  Yeah, this one sucks.
[24:55.880 --> 24:56.820]  Speedy the Turtle.
[24:56.980 --> 24:57.260]  Oh, I get it.
[24:57.280 --> 24:57.660]  That's ironic.
[24:58.800 --> 25:00.020]  Then there's little Tuffy.
[25:00.320 --> 25:01.140]  He doesn't look so tough.
[25:02.600 --> 25:02.960]  Trash.
[25:03.920 --> 25:04.620]  And, oh!
[25:04.900 --> 25:05.500]  Oh, oh.
[25:05.760 --> 25:06.200]  What is this?
[25:06.280 --> 25:07.460]  This is a threefer.
[25:07.800 --> 25:08.120]  Wow.
[25:08.280 --> 25:09.240]  It's official Beanie Baby.
[25:09.340 --> 25:09.880]  Oh, these are stickers.
[25:10.080 --> 25:10.580]  These are stickers.
[25:10.960 --> 25:11.320]  Wow!
[25:12.320 --> 25:13.140]  Can I have the bat sticker?
[25:13.480 --> 25:13.660]  Yeah.
[25:13.900 --> 25:14.140]  Cool.
[25:14.340 --> 25:14.660]  Thanks, man.
[25:15.220 --> 25:15.880]  Here you go.
[25:17.040 --> 25:17.780]  You're almost there.
[25:19.080 --> 25:20.440]  If you rip it, I'm gonna flip.
[25:20.500 --> 25:21.220]  I'm not gonna rip it, man.
[25:21.220 --> 25:22.720]  I'm gonna flip it if you fucking rip it, bro.
[25:22.920 --> 25:23.640]  I'm taking it.
[25:23.760 --> 25:24.240]  I'm taking very good...
[25:25.080 --> 25:25.500]  Oh, boy.
[25:25.940 --> 25:26.220]  Uh-oh.
[25:26.500 --> 25:27.460]  Andrew, he's gonna rip it.
[25:27.600 --> 25:29.560]  I'm not gonna rip it, but this is a hard sticker to get off.
[25:29.780 --> 25:30.040]  Andrew.
[25:30.580 --> 25:31.600]  It's been stuck.
[25:31.840 --> 25:31.900]  Wait.
[25:32.160 --> 25:32.620]  He's gonna rip it.
[25:32.620 --> 25:34.600]  I'm trying to figure out the value of Gucci the Jellyfish.
[25:34.760 --> 25:35.820]  This is gonna...
[25:35.820 --> 25:38.820]  This has been stuck for, I'm guessing, 15 years?
[25:38.880 --> 25:39.080]  Uh-huh.
[25:39.200 --> 25:40.440]  There's no way it resticks.
[25:41.120 --> 25:41.520]  What do you mean?
[25:41.560 --> 25:41.980]  Even if you rip it.
[25:42.020 --> 25:43.240]  Like, it's not gonna restick.
[25:43.320 --> 25:43.920]  It'll restick.
[25:44.480 --> 25:45.580]  It will not restick.
[25:45.620 --> 25:45.980]  Yeah, it will.
[25:46.720 --> 25:47.060]  It will not.
[25:47.060 --> 25:48.220]  As long as Geoff doesn't rip it.
[25:49.880 --> 25:50.760]  He ripped it.
[25:50.940 --> 25:51.460]  I didn't rip it.
[25:51.620 --> 25:52.140]  I didn't rip it.
[25:52.260 --> 25:53.700]  I can see the part where it ripped a little bit.
[25:55.440 --> 25:56.040]  There he...
[25:56.040 --> 25:56.200]  Okay.
[25:56.360 --> 25:56.620]  There.
[25:56.720 --> 25:57.500]  I put it on my laptop.
[25:58.860 --> 25:59.620]  He's hanging out.
[26:00.160 --> 26:00.700]  It's stuck.
[26:01.420 --> 26:02.760]  I'll let you know when it comes off.
[26:06.340 --> 26:07.280]  So far, so good.
[26:07.500 --> 26:09.880]  I'm gonna take a second to sleeve a couple of our biggest hits.
[26:09.880 --> 26:10.240]  Oh, yeah.
[26:10.260 --> 26:10.780]  That's good.
[26:11.020 --> 26:11.260]  Yeah.
[26:12.160 --> 26:17.060]  And while Geoff takes a second to sleeve that stuff, I wanna let you know that you can go
[26:17.060 --> 26:21.740]  over to store.roosterteeth.com and check out our new shirt inspired by Andrew's collection
[26:21.740 --> 26:22.240]  of sauces.
[26:22.680 --> 26:23.220]  That's right.
[26:23.260 --> 26:24.040]  It's our sauce shirt.
[26:24.680 --> 26:25.780]  You can see it here.
[26:25.960 --> 26:26.640]  Look at that.
[26:26.720 --> 26:27.740]  The fuckface sauce shirt.
[26:27.940 --> 26:28.780]  It's out now.
[26:30.680 --> 26:32.620]  Andrew, anything you wanna say about your sauce shirt?
[26:33.900 --> 26:34.700]  I wanna...
[26:34.700 --> 26:35.880]  I don't think you can really see it there.
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.460]  There's an important rutabaga in the ingredients.
[26:38.560 --> 26:38.900]  That's true.
[26:39.600 --> 26:41.440]  I'm still trying to sell the sauces.
[26:41.440 --> 26:47.140]  So, if you are interested in learning the darkest secrets of both K-pop and McDonald's,
[26:47.460 --> 26:48.320]  let me know.
[26:48.440 --> 26:48.780]  Okay.
[26:49.640 --> 26:53.080]  Yeah, or maybe, like, if you have the shirt, you can be like an ambassador and somebody
[26:53.080 --> 26:54.560]  walks up and is like, what's the shirt?
[26:54.660 --> 26:57.100]  You tell them, maybe you can find me a buyer.
[26:57.680 --> 26:58.500]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[26:58.940 --> 26:59.380]  That's smart.
[26:59.460 --> 27:00.120]  It's not...
[27:00.120 --> 27:03.160]  The sauce market not looking as hot as I anticipated.
[27:03.460 --> 27:04.300]  Oh, weird.
[27:04.680 --> 27:05.000]  Shocking.
[27:05.100 --> 27:05.560]  What are the odds?
[27:05.920 --> 27:06.660]  A lot of...
[27:06.660 --> 27:08.460]  A lot of Easter eggs on that shirt, though.
[27:08.480 --> 27:11.340]  What was the word that Gavin said for rutabaga?
[27:12.980 --> 27:14.880]  I don't remember anymore.
[27:15.000 --> 27:15.340]  I do.
[27:15.560 --> 27:16.340]  It was...
[27:17.600 --> 27:18.120]  Rutabaga?
[27:18.240 --> 27:18.520]  No.
[27:18.720 --> 27:20.120]  He said rutabaga, but...
[27:20.120 --> 27:20.300]  No.
[27:20.420 --> 27:21.200]  What's the...
[27:21.200 --> 27:22.240]  He has, like, a different word.
[27:22.940 --> 27:23.460]  Rumtumtugger.
[27:24.060 --> 27:24.580]  Rumtumtugger.
[27:24.680 --> 27:25.280]  What was it?
[27:26.700 --> 27:27.740]  British rutabaga.
[27:28.560 --> 27:30.340]  It's how much...
[27:31.400 --> 27:36.200]  There's been one sale of the Tide Beanie Babies Series 3 Wild Gold...
[27:36.200 --> 27:37.480]  Oh, we might not have the gold bearing.
[27:37.520 --> 27:38.060]  A Swede.
[27:38.320 --> 27:38.780]  Swede.
[27:38.880 --> 27:39.280]  That was it.
[27:39.280 --> 27:39.900]  A Swede.
[27:40.860 --> 27:41.000]  Ah.
[27:41.240 --> 27:42.360]  Which is stupid.
[27:42.860 --> 27:44.180]  A little story behind this one.
[27:44.320 --> 27:45.700]  Not a big story, but I'll open it.
[27:45.720 --> 27:45.960]  All right.
[27:45.960 --> 27:46.680]  A little tiny story.
[27:47.000 --> 27:51.300]  This is Game of Thrones, the Iron Anniversary Series 1 trading cards.
[27:51.440 --> 27:57.580]  Earlier today, I went to the baseball card shop on the way in just to get a few little things, just to make sure we had enough for you guys.
[27:58.020 --> 27:59.220]  And I saw these Game of Thrones cards.
[27:59.320 --> 28:01.640]  You know, I've been opening up Game of Thrones here.
[28:02.100 --> 28:03.880]  And I was like, fuck it.
[28:03.880 --> 28:04.740]  I'll just buy one pack.
[28:05.060 --> 28:06.380]  I haven't seen the series yet.
[28:06.760 --> 28:08.160]  And the foil on the pack is nice.
[28:08.160 --> 28:09.140]  And so I went to buy it.
[28:09.220 --> 28:14.100]  And the guy that owns the baseball card shop who does this for a living, he goes, can I ask you a question?
[28:14.680 --> 28:15.020]  I go, yeah.
[28:15.060 --> 28:16.500]  He goes, why are you buying this?
[28:16.720 --> 28:17.800]  And I go, I don't know.
[28:17.900 --> 28:19.460]  I'm just trying to get into non-sports cards.
[28:19.700 --> 28:21.360]  He goes, is there something going on with these?
[28:21.400 --> 28:22.200]  And I was like, what?
[28:22.280 --> 28:23.560]  And he goes, everybody's buying.
[28:23.620 --> 28:24.680]  Why are people buying these?
[28:24.780 --> 28:27.580]  I don't understand why people are buying Game of Thrones stuff all of a sudden.
[28:28.800 --> 28:30.180]  So apparently the secret is out.
[28:30.860 --> 28:31.760]  And they don't know why.
[28:31.820 --> 28:32.280]  Jump on.
[28:32.400 --> 28:33.280]  Jump on board, yeah.
[28:33.320 --> 28:33.700]  Let's go.
[28:35.460 --> 28:36.480]  You think it'll be anything good?
[28:37.100 --> 28:37.380]  No.
[28:37.380 --> 28:41.680]  I'm hoping for a brand falling at the tower or maybe...
[28:41.680 --> 28:42.460]  The big push.
[28:43.120 --> 28:43.320]  Yeah.
[28:43.460 --> 28:46.480]  Well, there's a Samwise Tully.
[28:47.440 --> 28:48.340]  There's a...
[28:48.340 --> 28:49.760]  Oh, boy.
[28:50.340 --> 28:50.460]  Oh, boy.
[28:50.840 --> 28:50.860]  Uh-oh.
[28:50.860 --> 28:52.280]  Oh, there's a lot happening right now.
[28:52.400 --> 28:53.200]  Oh, boy.
[28:53.580 --> 28:54.240]  You have to show it.
[28:54.440 --> 28:55.000]  Booyah.
[28:55.160 --> 28:55.680]  Wow.
[28:55.740 --> 28:57.720]  We got a Steven Cole.
[28:57.940 --> 28:58.220]  Wow.
[28:58.760 --> 29:01.540]  We got a Steven Cole auto and a quote auto.
[29:02.960 --> 29:07.220]  Loyal to Daenerys Targaryen is what he says.
[29:07.220 --> 29:08.240]  Is that what he wrote?
[29:08.620 --> 29:08.760]  Yeah.
[29:09.320 --> 29:10.400]  Yeah, he wrote...
[29:10.400 --> 29:11.220]  Why would you write that?
[29:11.220 --> 29:14.020]  He wrote his quote or his, like, a thing about him.
[29:14.020 --> 29:15.440]  Here's my line that I say.
[29:15.500 --> 29:16.740]  See, he's like, I'm loyal to...
[29:16.740 --> 29:17.660]  See, you see it right there, isn't it?
[29:17.720 --> 29:18.460]  Yeah, what's on the back?
[29:18.920 --> 29:23.460]  It says, this limited edition autograph card...
[29:23.460 --> 29:24.320]  By the way, I can read.
[29:24.360 --> 29:25.160]  I'm just reading upside down.
[29:26.320 --> 29:32.440]  Has been personally signed by Steven Cole as Kovarro in Game of Thrones.
[29:32.740 --> 29:33.020]  Boom.
[29:33.260 --> 29:33.660]  Look at that.
[29:33.980 --> 29:36.680]  I like that you had to reassure everyone that you can read.
[29:38.860 --> 29:39.920]  Guys, I can read.
[29:40.200 --> 29:42.220]  Listen, I'm from Alabama, and there's nothing I can do about that.
[29:42.280 --> 29:45.460]  I've been from Alabama my whole life, 46 years of being from Alabama.
[29:45.740 --> 29:46.880]  I fight a lot of prejudice.
[29:47.440 --> 29:48.160]  Oh, man.
[29:48.280 --> 29:51.220]  When it comes to my schooling and learning.
[29:51.400 --> 29:51.740]  Uh-huh.
[29:52.200 --> 29:52.720]  And I get it.
[29:52.740 --> 30:00.080]  I will say, as far as the hits go, when you search Steven Cole, you get a pastor above his IMDB, which is not the greatest thing.
[30:00.080 --> 30:01.420]  Oh, boy, that's rough.
[30:01.420 --> 30:02.420]  Here we got Littlefinger.
[30:02.660 --> 30:02.920]  Uh-huh.
[30:03.260 --> 30:05.540]  Base card, base card, Jorah Mormont.
[30:05.620 --> 30:05.740]  Yep.
[30:05.860 --> 30:08.120]  And then Kingslayer right there.
[30:08.840 --> 30:09.920]  Old Goldhand himself.
[30:10.060 --> 30:10.740]  Bunch of handsome men.
[30:10.880 --> 30:12.020]  Yeah, a bunch of handsome men.
[30:12.760 --> 30:13.320]  Are we?
[30:15.020 --> 30:15.660]  Something like that.
[30:15.900 --> 30:17.680]  I didn't see a lot of buy-in from you on that.
[30:17.800 --> 30:17.980]  Okay.
[30:18.720 --> 30:20.300]  Oh, I've been wanting to open this for a while.
[30:20.420 --> 30:22.200]  I bought these a long time ago, so let's just throw it in there.
[30:22.360 --> 30:25.880]  We're going to open some Garbage Pail Kids food fight.
[30:26.120 --> 30:28.000]  What was the Garbage Pail Kid thing?
[30:29.180 --> 30:31.480]  It was so everywhere.
[30:31.780 --> 30:38.220]  Yeah, when I was a kid, when I was collecting baseball cards in the mid-'80s, Garbage Pail Kids were where it was at.
[30:38.540 --> 30:41.220]  And they're very popular, again, with a certain audience.
[30:41.220 --> 30:42.020]  They are, it's true.
[30:42.280 --> 30:44.180]  Sorry, Charlie. Get it? Tuna.
[30:44.420 --> 30:44.600]  Yep.
[30:45.800 --> 30:47.940]  Starving Art. I liked it, and I...
[30:47.940 --> 30:47.960]  Ah.
[30:48.320 --> 30:48.680]  What's up?
[30:49.620 --> 30:52.040]  I was just going, ah. I was just reacting to the...
[30:52.040 --> 30:55.340]  I liked it because there was a G, Geoff.
[30:55.340 --> 31:02.840]  And as a kid with a G-E-O-F-F, Geoff, in the 80s, who went to, like, Disney World and, like, Silver Dollar City and all these places around the world,
[31:03.440 --> 31:08.420]  that you would get, like, keychains with your name on it and shit.
[31:08.440 --> 31:10.500]  There were no G, Geoff anything my entire life.
[31:10.560 --> 31:17.780]  So when they made a deaf Geoff, which was a dude with a boombox and his brain was going out the side, and they spelled it G-E-O-F-F, I lost my shit.
[31:17.920 --> 31:18.640]  They had me for life.
[31:20.240 --> 31:20.560]  Flatulance.
[31:21.340 --> 31:22.360]  Flatulance is a rad dude.
[31:22.960 --> 31:23.800]  That's what I was about to say.
[31:24.620 --> 31:25.420]  These are...
[31:25.420 --> 31:32.800]  If you watched the last episode and you saw us open up the rad dudes, these are who the rad dudes were based on and are infinitely better in every way.
[31:32.820 --> 31:33.080]  Yeah, I agree.
[31:33.280 --> 31:34.080]  Wax Max.
[31:36.400 --> 31:37.200]  Mmm, goodin'.
[31:37.200 --> 31:39.620]  Is he shitting in that soup can?
[31:40.060 --> 31:40.220]  Yeah.
[31:40.760 --> 31:40.900]  Yeah.
[31:41.140 --> 31:42.420]  I'm gonna put that over there, actually.
[31:42.580 --> 31:43.120]  We'll call that it.
[31:45.200 --> 31:46.000]  Sid Lid.
[31:47.040 --> 31:47.440]  Weird.
[31:47.600 --> 31:47.820]  Okay.
[31:48.000 --> 31:48.440]  Is it eating?
[31:48.680 --> 31:48.920]  Okay.
[31:50.740 --> 31:51.720]  What does it say?
[31:52.060 --> 31:52.980]  Ripened Ricardo.
[31:53.460 --> 31:54.100]  That's disgusting.
[31:54.280 --> 31:55.260]  He's like an... okay.
[31:55.480 --> 31:56.020]  An avocado.
[31:56.400 --> 31:56.460]  Yeah.
[31:57.080 --> 31:57.880]  Carlo Main.
[31:58.080 --> 31:58.980]  I don't know about this one.
[31:59.880 --> 32:00.280]  No.
[32:00.500 --> 32:01.300]  I don't like that one.
[32:02.480 --> 32:02.760]  Fresh...
[32:02.760 --> 32:03.460]  These keep getting worse.
[32:03.940 --> 32:04.620]  Yeah, they suck.
[32:04.880 --> 32:05.980]  By the way, these are recent, too.
[32:06.280 --> 32:07.380]  Cotton Candy.
[32:07.800 --> 32:08.380]  That's lame.
[32:09.000 --> 32:10.200]  It's a sticker, I guess?
[32:10.280 --> 32:10.600]  Oh, cool.
[32:10.700 --> 32:10.980]  Starving.
[32:11.380 --> 32:12.980]  Starving Art again, but the sticker version.
[32:13.140 --> 32:13.920]  Soiled Sam.
[32:14.400 --> 32:15.860]  There's a lot of poop humor in this.
[32:15.880 --> 32:15.980]  Cool.
[32:17.700 --> 32:18.500]  Brainless Bert.
[32:19.280 --> 32:19.680]  Okay.
[32:19.940 --> 32:20.880]  Looks like Frankenberry.
[32:21.000 --> 32:21.320]  Yeah, no.
[32:21.460 --> 32:22.360]  I get it.
[32:22.540 --> 32:23.700]  Snack Attack Jack.
[32:25.240 --> 32:27.240]  Jack couldn't be here, but he is kind of here in spirit.
[32:27.760 --> 32:30.380]  He couldn't be here because he's having a snack attack.
[32:30.880 --> 32:31.820]  Dylan Pickles.
[32:33.960 --> 32:34.740]  Spacey Stacey.
[32:35.120 --> 32:35.800]  These suck.
[32:35.820 --> 32:36.700]  These are not what I...
[32:36.700 --> 32:37.560]  That one's cool!
[32:37.600 --> 32:38.840]  Cheesy Chester is good.
[32:38.880 --> 32:39.280]  Yo!
[32:39.280 --> 32:40.500]  That one's the cat.
[32:41.000 --> 32:41.360]  That's awesome.
[32:41.360 --> 32:42.220]  Lily Linguini.
[32:42.600 --> 32:44.180]  She's linguini-ing her hand.
[32:44.220 --> 32:45.540]  I don't like it.
[32:45.740 --> 32:46.220]  These suck.
[32:46.360 --> 32:46.760]  Tater Todd.
[32:47.040 --> 32:47.440]  Oh.
[32:48.620 --> 32:49.500]  It's disturbing.
[32:49.700 --> 32:50.260]  I love it.
[32:50.300 --> 32:50.900]  These are terrible.
[32:50.920 --> 32:51.500]  These are terrible.
[32:51.580 --> 32:52.380]  Cool wit.
[32:55.540 --> 32:56.560]  Stuck in Keith.
[32:57.160 --> 32:57.780]  Get it?
[32:58.100 --> 32:58.880]  Sick Vlad.
[32:58.980 --> 33:00.640]  That's the same as the other one!
[33:01.060 --> 33:01.580]  Is it?
[33:01.740 --> 33:03.620]  There's a Dylan Pickles that you had earlier.
[33:03.760 --> 33:04.020]  Dylan Pickles.
[33:04.020 --> 33:05.180]  That's the same fucking thing.
[33:05.520 --> 33:06.320]  Well, hold on.
[33:06.520 --> 33:06.900]  No.
[33:07.520 --> 33:07.960]  Hold on.
[33:08.000 --> 33:08.920]  Let's find Dylan Pickles.
[33:09.340 --> 33:09.800]  Keep going.
[33:10.560 --> 33:11.220]  Dylan, Dylan.
[33:11.340 --> 33:11.740]  Where'd you go?
[33:11.820 --> 33:12.800]  Hold on, he's back here somewhere.
[33:13.680 --> 33:14.120]  There he is.
[33:15.300 --> 33:16.180]  It's the...
[33:16.960 --> 33:17.320]  Get...
[33:17.320 --> 33:17.540]  What?
[33:17.780 --> 33:18.060]  Oh.
[33:18.220 --> 33:18.440]  Oh.
[33:18.640 --> 33:19.360]  You know what?
[33:19.900 --> 33:20.480]  A and B.
[33:20.740 --> 33:22.420]  These are, uh...
[33:22.420 --> 33:22.740]  Oh.
[33:23.000 --> 33:23.380]  These are, it's like a variant.
[33:23.780 --> 33:24.740]  What names are different?
[33:24.780 --> 33:25.560]  One of them's probably a variant.
[33:25.680 --> 33:27.120]  And then there's Janet Planet.
[33:27.200 --> 33:28.120]  That's the same one too!
[33:28.120 --> 33:28.700]  That's the same one too.
[33:28.960 --> 33:29.160]  Yeah.
[33:29.280 --> 33:30.000]  This sucks.
[33:30.160 --> 33:31.020]  Yeah, they had two names.
[33:31.120 --> 33:31.880]  Throw these in the trash.
[33:32.080 --> 33:33.720]  Throw them in the trash.
[33:33.860 --> 33:35.780]  But we might slap a...
[33:35.780 --> 33:37.960]  Slap a number on the back of them and mail them to people.
[33:39.620 --> 33:43.260]  Alright, let's get a palate cleanser and open something real after that.
[33:43.260 --> 33:47.320]  How about some Tops Series 2 2021 Baseball?
[33:48.920 --> 33:49.320]  2021?
[33:49.860 --> 33:50.680]  This is this season's baseball?
[33:50.680 --> 33:51.280]  2020-2021.
[33:51.520 --> 33:51.660]  Wow.
[33:51.660 --> 33:52.500]  This is this season's baseball.
[33:52.620 --> 33:52.840]  Okay.
[33:53.020 --> 33:54.160]  I have opened a shitload of these at home.
[33:54.340 --> 33:54.600]  Okay.
[33:56.820 --> 33:57.220]  Uh...
[33:57.220 --> 33:59.420]  This is like playing MLB in a show, but in real life.
[33:59.580 --> 34:00.300]  Here's Woodford.
[34:00.800 --> 34:01.060]  Uh-huh.
[34:02.020 --> 34:03.020]  Um, let's see.
[34:03.340 --> 34:05.060]  Uh, Yandy Diaz.
[34:05.080 --> 34:06.360]  We have Nicks.
[34:07.160 --> 34:07.560]  What?
[34:07.700 --> 34:08.720]  We have Jordan Hicks.
[34:08.740 --> 34:09.880]  I can't read all of it upside down.
[34:10.160 --> 34:11.220]  Alex Conner.
[34:11.460 --> 34:12.280]  We got...
[34:12.280 --> 34:13.100]  Nick Solak.
[34:13.320 --> 34:14.360]  Nick Solak's good.
[34:14.460 --> 34:14.960]  He is pretty good.
[34:15.220 --> 34:18.160]  Uh, Brian Anderson.
[34:19.480 --> 34:20.480]  Not the CNN...
[34:20.480 --> 34:21.620]  Not the ESPN Sports announcer.
[34:21.800 --> 34:21.960]  No.
[34:22.640 --> 34:24.560]  Uh, there's Juan Soto.
[34:24.760 --> 34:25.120]  Insert.
[34:25.440 --> 34:26.940]  Uh, Childish Gambino.
[34:27.100 --> 34:27.320]  Indeed.
[34:27.460 --> 34:28.400]  These are all named weird.
[34:28.700 --> 34:30.440]  Like, this one's named Childish Gambino.
[34:30.500 --> 34:30.760]  Indeed.
[34:31.060 --> 34:31.600]  I don't know why.
[34:31.760 --> 34:32.020]  Okay.
[34:32.440 --> 34:33.580]  Uh, Kristen Pash.
[34:33.780 --> 34:34.720]  He's pretty good.
[34:34.860 --> 34:35.720]  Alec Bohm, rookie.
[34:36.080 --> 34:37.040]  That's a good card right there.
[34:37.440 --> 34:38.440]  I like the way that looks, too.
[34:38.500 --> 34:38.920]  That's pretty cool.
[34:39.420 --> 34:40.580]  Alec Bohm's a pretty hot dude.
[34:41.380 --> 34:42.600]  I mean, I'm not...
[34:42.600 --> 34:43.240]  Maybe hot physically.
[34:43.340 --> 34:44.620]  I just meant talent-wise.
[34:45.560 --> 34:46.840]  But he might also be attractive.
[34:46.860 --> 34:47.420]  Maybe hot physically.
[34:47.420 --> 34:48.060]  I don't think you need to clarify.
[34:48.220 --> 34:48.880]  I just realized, yeah.
[34:51.760 --> 34:52.120]  Um...
[34:52.540 --> 34:53.580]  That's a high leg.
[34:53.960 --> 34:54.720]  That's a high leg.
[34:54.740 --> 34:55.440]  That is a high leg.
[34:55.480 --> 34:57.420]  But it's only the back of the leg.
[34:57.900 --> 34:59.180]  He's showing his calves.
[34:59.240 --> 34:59.420]  Yep.
[35:00.860 --> 35:01.220]  Uh...
[35:01.220 --> 35:02.420]  I can't read that from upside down.
[35:02.940 --> 35:04.960]  This is Jose Marmolejas.
[35:05.800 --> 35:06.520]  Uh, alright.
[35:08.100 --> 35:08.460]  Goddamn.
[35:08.560 --> 35:09.000]  Who are we looking at?
[35:09.000 --> 35:10.240]  Luis Camposano.
[35:10.360 --> 35:11.000]  Ooh, campy.
[35:11.860 --> 35:12.480]  He's a...
[35:12.480 --> 35:12.720]  Yep.
[35:12.920 --> 35:13.400]  Your team.
[35:14.200 --> 35:14.920]  And then...
[35:14.920 --> 35:15.440]  Pavan Smith.
[35:15.660 --> 35:15.920]  Okay.
[35:16.320 --> 35:16.900]  Pretty solid.
[35:17.240 --> 35:19.480]  I'll save that high kick for you, Andrew.
[35:20.560 --> 35:21.980]  Yeah, well, we're measuring.
[35:22.200 --> 35:22.560]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35:22.580 --> 35:23.760]  We need to compare it against the other ones.
[35:23.760 --> 35:24.040]  It's true.
[35:24.540 --> 35:24.800]  Alright.
[35:24.960 --> 35:26.320]  Well, that's a lot of one-offs.
[35:26.440 --> 35:27.840]  What do you guys feel like now?
[35:27.860 --> 35:28.840]  How are we doing on time?
[35:28.920 --> 35:29.540]  We still have...
[35:29.540 --> 35:30.660]  We have a long...
[35:30.660 --> 35:31.120]  What did we go to?
[35:31.160 --> 35:31.440]  Five?
[35:31.680 --> 35:31.900]  Yeah.
[35:32.060 --> 35:32.580]  Oh, God.
[35:32.680 --> 35:34.000]  You said you wanted two hours!
[35:34.120 --> 35:35.040]  This was your call.
[35:35.120 --> 35:37.620]  You are the one who said that that's how long this needed to be.
[35:37.620 --> 35:40.660]  Alright, well...
[35:40.660 --> 35:41.800]  That was good.
[35:42.300 --> 35:42.660]  I'm fine.
[35:42.720 --> 35:43.360]  I'm happy with that.
[35:44.260 --> 35:44.920]  I'm kidding.
[35:46.240 --> 35:47.560]  This is something.
[35:48.440 --> 35:49.120]  I'm just kidding.
[35:49.140 --> 35:51.060]  Anything that's not Umbrella Academy, I'm into.
[35:51.080 --> 35:52.000]  Anything that's not Umbrella Academy.
[35:52.080 --> 35:52.920]  Andrew, do you have any preference?
[35:53.100 --> 35:55.400]  I would like to open the Diana cards.
[35:55.560 --> 35:56.320]  The royalty cards.
[35:56.340 --> 35:56.840]  Oh, okay.
[35:56.840 --> 35:57.860]  I'm learning a lot.
[35:59.440 --> 36:00.400]  I realized...
[36:00.400 --> 36:01.560]  I've learned things.
[36:01.700 --> 36:02.280]  It is...
[36:02.280 --> 36:04.380]  It's Wes Ellis' birthday today.
[36:04.540 --> 36:06.600]  Photographer extraordinaire for Rooster Teeth.
[36:06.600 --> 36:12.380]  His girlfriend, Alyssa, is so fucking into Princess Diana and all that.
[36:12.480 --> 36:13.060]  It's like...
[36:13.540 --> 36:18.000]  She's way in, way, way, way into particularly the Diana stuff.
[36:18.160 --> 36:18.260]  Really?
[36:18.380 --> 36:19.840]  So, like, this is right up her alley.
[36:20.060 --> 36:22.280]  Oh, well, maybe we'll get a big pull for her.
[36:22.280 --> 36:22.640]  Oh, cool.
[36:22.720 --> 36:23.360]  That's very exciting.
[36:23.680 --> 36:24.280]  For her boyfriend's birthday.
[36:24.360 --> 36:25.100]  Happy birthday, Wes.
[36:25.220 --> 36:25.880]  Happy birthday, Wes.
[36:25.900 --> 36:26.320]  He's not here.
[36:26.680 --> 36:29.040]  So, the packs are called the World's Biggest Story?
[36:29.260 --> 36:30.040]  Is that what the pack is?
[36:30.220 --> 36:30.980]  So, I guess, though.
[36:31.040 --> 36:33.620]  It says, World's Biggest Story Press Pass.
[36:34.780 --> 36:38.420]  The Royal Family, Volume 1, 1993 Edition.
[36:38.560 --> 36:43.600]  I should say that I actually got this pack from my own lovely mother.
[36:44.220 --> 36:47.440]  She found this somewhere at a yard sale or at an antique mall.
[36:47.660 --> 36:47.920]  That's very cool.
[36:47.920 --> 36:48.440]  And she mailed it to me.
[36:48.560 --> 36:48.860]  That's very cool.
[36:49.300 --> 36:51.160]  And she sent it to me probably two months ago.
[36:51.280 --> 36:52.280]  So, I've been waiting to open this.
[36:52.360 --> 36:52.680]  Very excited.
[36:52.760 --> 36:53.240]  Thanks, Mom.
[36:53.660 --> 36:54.240]  I hope we get...
[36:54.240 --> 36:55.660]  I hope we pull some...
[36:56.740 --> 36:57.100]  Some...
[36:58.620 --> 36:59.460]  Royal fire for you.
[36:59.460 --> 37:00.660]  Do you think we'll get the Chuck Chaser?
[37:00.860 --> 37:01.740]  Do you think we'll get the...
[37:01.740 --> 37:03.480]  Do you think we'll get the Prince Charles?
[37:03.480 --> 37:05.320]  What if we get, like, a Charles Relic?
[37:05.540 --> 37:05.820]  Whoa!
[37:06.460 --> 37:07.260]  Damn, and it's like...
[37:07.260 --> 37:09.020]  It's like a cut-off, like, of his jacket.
[37:10.400 --> 37:11.460]  Let's see what we have here.
[37:11.600 --> 37:12.100]  I can't...
[37:12.100 --> 37:13.520]  I better read any of this shit upside down.
[37:13.620 --> 37:13.780]  Okay.
[37:14.200 --> 37:15.140]  This is...
[37:15.140 --> 37:15.900]  Oh, Prince Andrew.
[37:16.080 --> 37:16.340]  Okay.
[37:16.660 --> 37:18.280]  Left behind in cursive, too.
[37:18.360 --> 37:19.300]  You move up to a different classroom.
[37:19.300 --> 37:19.640]  Yeah.
[37:20.040 --> 37:21.380]  No, I know the cursive.
[37:22.200 --> 37:22.920]  Not bad.
[37:23.440 --> 37:24.000]  Not a bad...
[37:24.000 --> 37:25.420]  No bad touch of roses for D.
[37:27.100 --> 37:29.260]  And then, a passion for fashion.
[37:29.680 --> 37:29.860]  What?
[37:30.020 --> 37:30.880]  That's just mean.
[37:30.980 --> 37:31.860]  Yeah, what the...
[37:31.860 --> 37:33.320]  These are catty cards.
[37:33.320 --> 37:33.480]  These are... yeah.
[37:33.720 --> 37:33.900]  What does it say?
[37:34.400 --> 37:36.060]  It says, Queen Elizabeth's penchant for doubting...
[37:36.060 --> 37:36.800]  Ooh, Lord.
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.660]  Doubtiness, boxy outfits, unfashionable glasses...
[37:39.660 --> 37:40.100]  Jesus!
[37:40.420 --> 37:41.340]  Clunky handbags...
[37:41.340 --> 37:43.600]  Drives designer Hardy Amies to lament,
[37:43.880 --> 37:45.520]  I wish she was more of a clothes person.
[37:46.480 --> 37:46.960]  God!
[37:47.220 --> 37:47.700]  Jesus.
[37:48.180 --> 37:48.720]  That's mean.
[37:48.940 --> 37:49.220]  Yeah.
[37:49.520 --> 37:50.100]  What is this?
[37:50.660 --> 37:51.060]  Caricatures?
[37:51.060 --> 37:52.500]  Just so you know, that is not a photo, Geoff.
[37:52.760 --> 37:53.240]  That's...
[37:53.240 --> 37:54.480]  Because there was confusion in the past.
[37:54.840 --> 37:56.840]  That looks like, uh...
[37:56.840 --> 37:57.860]  That looks like...
[37:59.160 --> 38:00.900]  Camilla Bowles and what's-his-face.
[38:00.900 --> 38:01.260]  It does.
[38:01.600 --> 38:02.340]  Prince Charles.
[38:02.580 --> 38:02.940]  Prince Charles.
[38:03.180 --> 38:03.580]  We'll save that.
[38:03.660 --> 38:04.320]  Ooh, look at this.
[38:04.380 --> 38:04.960]  I like that.
[38:05.080 --> 38:05.900]  Also not a photo.
[38:06.260 --> 38:07.200]  That's also not a photo.
[38:07.300 --> 38:09.580]  It looks like an art card of Princess Di, I would assume.
[38:09.740 --> 38:09.980]  Mm-hmm.
[38:10.560 --> 38:11.920]  A passion for fashion.
[38:12.060 --> 38:12.600]  Yeah, but this one, they need it.
[38:12.600 --> 38:13.520]  Oh, she looks lovely.
[38:13.580 --> 38:14.000]  Yeah, this one...
[38:14.000 --> 38:15.100]  That's lovely.
[38:15.600 --> 38:16.360]  We should...
[38:16.360 --> 38:17.540]  Oh, this is...
[38:17.540 --> 38:19.520]  This is a great two-fold right here.
[38:19.860 --> 38:20.900]  We'll sell these...
[38:20.900 --> 38:22.400]  Or we'll bundle these together.
[38:22.480 --> 38:22.900]  Yeah, it's rough.
[38:23.040 --> 38:23.320]  They belong together.
[38:24.060 --> 38:25.320]  More passion for fashion.
[38:26.420 --> 38:27.580]  More passion for fashion.
[38:28.460 --> 38:29.020]  Cool hats.
[38:29.520 --> 38:29.920]  And...
[38:29.920 --> 38:31.860]  Ooh, there's a press pass of Queen Elizabeth.
[38:32.360 --> 38:32.720]  What does it say?
[38:32.820 --> 38:33.320]  A press pass?
[38:33.780 --> 38:34.840]  Like, so if I put that...
[38:34.840 --> 38:36.020]  If I slip that in, like, right here?
[38:36.220 --> 38:36.600]  It says press pass.
[38:36.780 --> 38:36.940]  I don't know.
[38:38.100 --> 38:39.460]  Fortunes and futures.
[38:41.060 --> 38:41.380]  Glamorous.
[38:42.180 --> 38:42.500]  Glamorous?
[38:42.500 --> 38:44.820]  I believe that could be used as a plane ticket to England.
[38:45.920 --> 38:47.060]  A plane ticket?
[38:47.580 --> 38:48.860]  I think they accept those.
[38:49.120 --> 38:49.660]  Yeah, that sounds right.
[38:51.960 --> 38:52.780]  That was good.
[38:52.880 --> 38:53.820]  That was a good little palate cleanser.
[38:53.860 --> 38:54.220]  I like that.
[38:54.280 --> 38:55.360]  Yeah, that was...
[38:55.360 --> 38:56.920]  I'm not really sure what to expect.
[38:57.080 --> 38:59.140]  Like, it's not like they were gonna have rookie numbers, you know what I mean?
[38:59.140 --> 39:00.260]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[39:00.440 --> 39:00.840]  Let's...
[39:00.840 --> 39:01.200]  I'll tell you what.
[39:01.240 --> 39:02.220]  Let's read the back of this and see.
[39:02.240 --> 39:02.860]  Okay, all right.
[39:02.960 --> 39:03.880]  Queen Elizabeth II.
[39:04.120 --> 39:06.500]  The Queen of England, April 21st, 1926.
[39:06.600 --> 39:11.180]  I guarantee you, if Gavin were here, he would know none of this.
[39:11.200 --> 39:11.900]  Yeah, yes.
[39:11.960 --> 39:12.800]  No, that sounds right.
[39:13.520 --> 39:14.460]  Uh, Taurus...
[39:14.460 --> 39:14.980]  Oh, she's a Taurus.
[39:15.100 --> 39:15.720]  Ruled by Venus.
[39:15.920 --> 39:16.560]  Makes sense.
[39:16.660 --> 39:19.600]  Kept her calm, confidence and crown intact last year.
[39:19.780 --> 39:25.200]  Unfortunately, 1993 sees an alignment of Uranus and Neptune, which can cause empires to shatter.
[39:25.200 --> 39:25.860]  What's going on?
[39:26.000 --> 39:27.360]  This is the future.
[39:27.360 --> 39:27.420]  This is the future.
[39:27.540 --> 39:29.420]  It's what's in the stars for Queen Elizabeth.
[39:29.420 --> 39:30.520]  You gotta tell Emily about this stuff.
[39:30.560 --> 39:30.660]  Yeah.
[39:30.880 --> 39:33.580]  So this is from 93, so now we know if this was true or not.
[39:33.900 --> 39:39.380]  We can hit the tabloids from years past and find out,
[39:39.460 --> 39:43.420]  You'll need boundless energy to fight this century's prime astrological event.
[39:43.820 --> 39:47.760]  Paying taxes was a great public relations move, but there will be no more deals,
[39:48.040 --> 39:49.560]  and future decisions will impact history.
[39:49.640 --> 39:50.560]  It goes on for a long time.
[39:50.560 --> 39:54.640]  The only thing that mattered in 93 was that Souls of Mischief's album, 93 to Infinity.
[39:55.300 --> 39:58.160]  Everything else is just sort of like, second, who cares.
[39:58.340 --> 39:58.960]  Fair enough.
[39:59.400 --> 40:01.380]  Is that Tatis on the front of the tops?
[40:01.560 --> 40:02.440]  Yeah, Fernando Tatis Jr.
[40:02.480 --> 40:02.900]  Nice.
[40:03.200 --> 40:05.380]  It's also the year I graduated high school and joined the army.
[40:06.100 --> 40:06.540]  Pummer.
[40:06.940 --> 40:07.140]  Yeah.
[40:07.940 --> 40:09.380]  That fucking sucks, dude.
[40:10.800 --> 40:12.480]  It's okay, it was a quick pause.
[40:12.960 --> 40:14.960]  You're like, yeah, Desert Storm's gotta be over by now.
[40:15.100 --> 40:16.140]  Let me get in there.
[40:16.280 --> 40:17.440]  Exactly what happened.
[40:18.900 --> 40:19.340]  Darius.
[40:19.600 --> 40:21.520]  We're gonna open up some NFL prestige.
[40:21.660 --> 40:22.420]  Darius Slayton.
[40:22.520 --> 40:22.780]  Okay.
[40:23.160 --> 40:23.820]  Cole Beasley.
[40:26.920 --> 40:27.880]  Joe Mixon.
[40:28.880 --> 40:29.840]  Chase Young.
[40:30.160 --> 40:30.740]  What does this say?
[40:31.140 --> 40:33.420]  Young bags first NFL sack.
[40:33.540 --> 40:34.160]  Oh, that's fun.
[40:34.340 --> 40:35.200]  It's like a headline.
[40:35.800 --> 40:36.960]  Cute little card.
[40:37.100 --> 40:37.200]  Is that?
[40:38.060 --> 40:38.220]  Hmm.
[40:39.180 --> 40:40.160]  I haven't seen this before.
[40:40.540 --> 40:42.040]  Here's Jamarcus Chase.
[40:42.160 --> 40:42.860]  What does it say?
[40:43.620 --> 40:44.520]  Oh, Jamar Chase.
[40:44.720 --> 40:45.580]  Okay, that's a rookie card.
[40:46.000 --> 40:46.820]  Anthony Barr.
[40:47.680 --> 40:48.480]  Odell Beckham Jr.
[40:49.100 --> 40:49.580]  ODBJ.
[40:50.120 --> 40:50.380]  Nice.
[40:50.480 --> 40:51.240]  Such is the Browns now, huh?
[40:51.540 --> 40:52.700]  I'm not up to date on NFL.
[40:52.800 --> 40:53.320]  Yes, yeah.
[40:53.320 --> 40:56.480]  And Anthony Forskin.
[40:56.800 --> 40:57.240]  There you go.
[40:57.400 --> 40:57.480]  Huh?
[40:57.640 --> 40:58.440]  It's Anthony Forskin.
[40:58.600 --> 40:58.700]  Oh.
[40:59.240 --> 41:01.780]  Hey, did you see the potential new names for Washington football team?
[41:02.340 --> 41:02.780]  No.
[41:02.880 --> 41:03.600]  I want to get your take on this.
[41:03.620 --> 41:04.440]  Is this legit?
[41:04.620 --> 41:05.520]  Yes, no, this is legit.
[41:05.580 --> 41:08.300]  There are three finalists that were selected from these eight candidates.
[41:08.620 --> 41:12.340]  These are the eight candidates for the new name for the Washington football team.
[41:12.440 --> 41:12.820]  Very excited.
[41:13.400 --> 41:14.860]  Would be the Washington Armada.
[41:15.200 --> 41:15.460]  Okay.
[41:15.580 --> 41:16.660]  The Washington Brigade.
[41:17.640 --> 41:18.520]  Washington Commanders.
[41:19.240 --> 41:20.120]  Washington Defenders.
[41:20.980 --> 41:21.860]  Washington Presidents.
[41:22.440 --> 41:23.680]  Washington Red Hogs.
[41:24.040 --> 41:25.180]  Washington Red Wolves.
[41:25.860 --> 41:26.720]  Washington football team.
[41:28.080 --> 41:29.120]  What do you think?
[41:29.220 --> 41:30.440]  Like, what's your pick there?
[41:30.540 --> 41:32.980]  Well, Red Hogs is just terrible.
[41:33.060 --> 41:34.380]  Like, beautifully terrible.
[41:34.620 --> 41:35.260]  Red Hogs?
[41:36.080 --> 41:41.000]  Like, that's a perfect setup for every other team in the NFL to dunk on them constantly.
[41:41.000 --> 41:41.400]  Yes.
[41:41.700 --> 41:44.040]  I mean, I think Defenders probably makes...
[41:44.900 --> 41:49.660]  Defenders sounds like the most like a football team or a football team that would be in any given Sunday.
[41:49.860 --> 41:50.020]  Yeah.
[41:50.020 --> 41:53.220]  Like, it's the most fake one, so it sounds like it would be the most real.
[41:53.440 --> 41:54.380]  I like Red Wolves.
[41:54.580 --> 41:55.300]  Red Wolves ain't bad.
[41:55.500 --> 41:57.940]  I think Red Wolves sounds sick, but that means it's not going to happen.
[41:57.980 --> 42:00.440]  We don't have a lot of wolves in sports. We have Timberwolves.
[42:00.500 --> 42:01.260]  There are Timberwolves.
[42:01.620 --> 42:02.240]  And, uh...
[42:02.240 --> 42:02.420]  Yeah.
[42:03.160 --> 42:05.180]  There's probably like a Wolfpack somewhere, but...
[42:05.180 --> 42:05.620]  That was my high school.
[42:05.620 --> 42:10.400]  Is it Washington Football Team as the name, or would they just be called Washington under that?
[42:10.440 --> 42:14.580]  I mean, it would be Washington blank, like it would be Los Angeles Rams, you know what I mean?
[42:14.620 --> 42:15.960]  That's what they're now, right? Washington Football Team?
[42:15.960 --> 42:16.780]  Yeah, they're Washington Football Team.
[42:16.840 --> 42:17.000]  Yeah.
[42:17.800 --> 42:18.900]  Uh, Jose Barrios.
[42:19.280 --> 42:20.580]  I want to get into...
[42:20.580 --> 42:21.380]  Andrew and I were talking about this the other day.
[42:21.460 --> 42:22.780]  I want to get back into NFL.
[42:23.040 --> 42:24.020]  I don't have a team I follow.
[42:24.320 --> 42:25.300]  You don't have mine left.
[42:25.520 --> 42:26.760]  Yeah, I don't know how to find one.
[42:27.440 --> 42:28.460]  Uh, Claire Schmidt.
[42:29.560 --> 42:30.120]  Shane Bieber.
[42:30.840 --> 42:31.360]  That's a good one.
[42:31.680 --> 42:32.360]  He's a popular dude.
[42:32.460 --> 42:32.840]  Yeah, he is.
[42:33.600 --> 42:34.500]  Uh, Dominic Smith.
[42:35.100 --> 42:37.020]  We got, uh, Danny Jansen.
[42:37.680 --> 42:39.320]  We got Kyle Tucker.
[42:39.700 --> 42:41.980]  Dude, I am all back into baseball now.
[42:42.120 --> 42:42.300]  Yeah?
[42:42.560 --> 42:43.380]  Yeah, it's been a good...
[42:43.380 --> 42:46.080]  Well, as a White Sox fan, it's a good year to jump back into the White Sox.
[42:46.080 --> 42:46.440]  Yeah, it is.
[42:46.440 --> 42:48.060]  Did you see, uh, Lynn get tossed?
[42:48.280 --> 42:48.540]  Mm-hmm.
[42:48.620 --> 42:50.840]  Uh, for tossing a belt to the umpire?
[42:51.300 --> 42:52.040]  Did you see that?
[42:52.100 --> 42:52.260]  Yeah.
[42:52.360 --> 42:52.860]  That was awesome.
[42:52.920 --> 42:53.460]  Jason Kippens.
[42:53.520 --> 42:55.220]  I also saw, uh, that dude get hit in the face.
[42:55.560 --> 42:57.420]  Dude, that was gnarly.
[42:57.960 --> 42:58.720]  Said he was okay.
[42:59.120 --> 42:59.520]  Any time...
[42:59.520 --> 43:00.840]  There was a lot of blood on that towel.
[43:00.940 --> 43:01.060]  Yep, yep.
[43:01.080 --> 43:01.300]  That was gross.
[43:01.840 --> 43:03.020]  Uh, I hate to see that stuff.
[43:03.160 --> 43:04.600]  Uh, Ryan...
[43:04.600 --> 43:05.860]  I can't read it upside down.
[43:06.020 --> 43:07.200]  Uh, Ryan McBroom.
[43:07.320 --> 43:08.320]  Did you get another Soto?
[43:08.460 --> 43:10.040]  Another Soto breaking out the broom.
[43:10.200 --> 43:11.020]  Dude, what the hell?
[43:11.360 --> 43:12.420]  Jazz Chisholm rookie.
[43:12.720 --> 43:14.280]  That's, uh, that's a baseball name.
[43:14.800 --> 43:15.800]  Jazz Chisholm rookie.
[43:15.800 --> 43:16.960]  It's actually a good card.
[43:17.200 --> 43:18.220]  There's something about, like...
[43:18.220 --> 43:18.720]  Good dude.
[43:18.860 --> 43:20.640]  There's certain names in baseball...
[43:20.640 --> 43:20.680]  Chisholm, man.
[43:20.680 --> 43:22.320]  ...where you just got a baseball name.
[43:23.260 --> 43:25.400]  Sean Figgins spelled Chone Figgins?
[43:25.440 --> 43:26.300]  That's a baseball name.
[43:26.720 --> 43:29.740]  Also, I had so much fun watching that fuckin', uh,
[43:30.400 --> 43:31.220]  Field of Dreams game.
[43:31.500 --> 43:32.300]  Oh, that was pretty cool, huh?
[43:32.300 --> 43:32.500]  Yeah.
[43:32.700 --> 43:33.700]  I liked having the corn.
[43:33.820 --> 43:34.140]  Yeah.
[43:34.220 --> 43:34.380]  Yeah.
[43:34.560 --> 43:35.960]  Watching the players come out of the corn was awesome.
[43:36.020 --> 43:37.780]  I, uh, play MLB the show all the time,
[43:37.820 --> 43:39.420]  and that was the thing that they did that week.
[43:39.480 --> 43:40.620]  They had, like, the field.
[43:40.660 --> 43:42.300]  You could unlock the field and then play
[43:42.300 --> 43:44.240]  in, like, those old uniforms and play,
[43:44.320 --> 43:45.200]  like, hit it into the corn.
[43:45.200 --> 43:46.380]  It was sick.
[43:46.520 --> 43:47.840]  Do you play as the Padres?
[43:48.520 --> 43:49.020]  Uh, yeah.
[43:49.140 --> 43:49.980]  I mean, it just depends.
[43:50.020 --> 43:51.240]  I have my own team, so...
[43:51.240 --> 43:51.920]  Oh, okay.
[43:52.300 --> 43:53.160]  The best of the best, guys.
[43:55.180 --> 43:56.800]  Jojo Romero, rookie.
[43:57.300 --> 43:59.000]  Uh, Chris Davis.
[44:00.500 --> 44:01.460]  Brent Rooker.
[44:02.520 --> 44:04.080]  And who do we have here?
[44:04.200 --> 44:04.980]  Tanner Houck.
[44:05.320 --> 44:05.460]  Hmm.
[44:05.980 --> 44:06.400]  Hmm.
[44:06.400 --> 44:06.780]  Hmm.
[44:07.020 --> 44:07.280]  Hmm.
[44:07.680 --> 44:07.800]  Hmm.
[44:08.040 --> 44:08.220]  Hmm.
[44:08.300 --> 44:08.320]  Hmm.
[44:08.320 --> 44:08.660]  Hmm.
[44:08.940 --> 44:09.420]  Hmm.
[44:09.420 --> 44:12.300]  Red Hog sounds like the name of a double-A baseball team.
[44:12.760 --> 44:13.240]  Oh, definitely.
[44:13.820 --> 44:14.460]  Yeah, it's...
[44:14.460 --> 44:14.800]  Like, that's like...
[44:14.800 --> 44:16.860]  You, like, hear about a player who is, like,
[44:16.900 --> 44:18.660]  in the Hall of Fame or the greatest Red Hogs player
[44:18.660 --> 44:20.080]  of all time that you've never heard of,
[44:20.100 --> 44:21.100]  but you get kind of excited?
[44:21.420 --> 44:21.740]  That...
[44:21.740 --> 44:23.480]  I mean, I think the great thing about
[44:24.440 --> 44:26.240]  minor league baseball is that
[44:26.240 --> 44:27.740]  they can be named anything.
[44:27.800 --> 44:29.400]  Like, the Amarillo Sod Poodles
[44:29.400 --> 44:31.080]  or the Rocket City Trash Pandas.
[44:31.220 --> 44:31.400]  Yeah.
[44:31.520 --> 44:32.720]  Like, you can be whatever,
[44:32.920 --> 44:33.460]  and it doesn't...
[44:33.460 --> 44:35.520]  Like, the El Paso Chihuahuas,
[44:35.760 --> 44:36.980]  like, none of it matters.
[44:37.220 --> 44:37.480]  Doesn't matter at all.
[44:37.480 --> 44:39.180]  And the weirder it is, the better it is.
[44:39.960 --> 44:42.300]  Round Rock Express has the unfortunate thing
[44:43.060 --> 44:44.460]  of being named after...
[44:44.940 --> 44:45.660]  a train?
[44:46.020 --> 44:46.760]  Who gives a shit?
[44:47.040 --> 44:48.520]  It's like, maybe name something cooler.
[44:48.680 --> 44:50.020]  That's why, on some Sundays,
[44:50.160 --> 44:51.200]  they're the Chupacabras.
[44:51.560 --> 44:52.100]  I gotta say...
[44:52.100 --> 44:52.960]  I hate to say it, man,
[44:53.020 --> 44:53.760]  but I'm right there with you.
[44:53.840 --> 44:55.060]  I'm not a fan of the name.
[44:55.100 --> 44:55.900]  No, it sucks.
[44:56.420 --> 44:56.820]  I don't...
[44:56.820 --> 44:58.020]  Like, trains...
[44:58.020 --> 44:58.900]  I get it.
[44:59.000 --> 44:59.880]  Trains were cool...
[44:59.880 --> 45:00.060]  Yep.
[45:00.200 --> 45:01.540]  ...when we didn't have a lot else going on
[45:02.060 --> 45:03.160]  in America, you know?
[45:03.560 --> 45:06.280]  In 1902, trains were the fucking shit.
[45:06.480 --> 45:07.360]  Yeah, trains were awesome
[45:07.360 --> 45:08.700]  up until, like, maybe the 60s.
[45:08.700 --> 45:08.880]  Yeah.
[45:08.900 --> 45:09.760]  But they're not anymore.
[45:09.840 --> 45:10.040]  No.
[45:10.340 --> 45:10.960]  Trains suck.
[45:11.160 --> 45:11.360]  Yeah.
[45:11.640 --> 45:12.620]  I'm anti-trains.
[45:13.040 --> 45:15.060]  You've never had the impulse to buy, like, a set?
[45:15.380 --> 45:15.860]  What'd you say, Andrew?
[45:15.860 --> 45:16.800]  Like, the full train...
[45:16.800 --> 45:18.140]  to get the full train set going.
[45:18.200 --> 45:19.580]  You've never had that impulse in life?
[45:19.860 --> 45:20.680]  You've never had the thought of,
[45:20.740 --> 45:21.600]  I might be a train guy?
[45:21.820 --> 45:22.120]  No.
[45:22.160 --> 45:22.380]  No.
[45:22.560 --> 45:22.760]  No.
[45:22.900 --> 45:23.020]  No.
[45:23.180 --> 45:23.360]  Never.
[45:23.540 --> 45:25.620]  I'm also not, like, 70.
[45:26.060 --> 45:26.260]  Yeah.
[45:26.320 --> 45:28.060]  Like, I feel like that's a 70-year-old dude thing.
[45:28.080 --> 45:28.220]  Yeah.
[45:28.420 --> 45:30.240]  There's a DJ from San Diego...
[45:30.240 --> 45:31.160]  well, he's in L.A., too,
[45:31.200 --> 45:32.720]  but this guy, Shotgun Tom Kelly,
[45:32.900 --> 45:35.040]  who always wore a big hat,
[45:35.160 --> 45:36.140]  and he was all,
[45:37.280 --> 45:38.480]  like, that kind of, like, DJ?
[45:38.480 --> 45:39.760]  Is he Machine Gun Kelly's dad?
[45:39.840 --> 45:41.420]  No, but that's a great question.
[45:42.840 --> 45:44.520]  Shotgun Tom Kelly was, like,
[45:44.520 --> 45:45.860]  I always thought he was really cool,
[45:46.120 --> 45:47.160]  and called the, like,
[45:47.240 --> 45:48.200]  worked at the radio station
[45:48.200 --> 45:49.080]  down the street from my house,
[45:49.160 --> 45:51.120]  and then found out he was a train guy,
[45:51.140 --> 45:52.220]  like, a month ago.
[45:52.500 --> 45:53.360]  And he is, like,
[45:54.200 --> 45:55.700]  world's largest train collection
[45:55.700 --> 45:56.680]  kind of, like, train guy.
[45:56.740 --> 45:58.120]  Not, like, kind of train guy.
[45:59.180 --> 45:59.900]  Train guy.
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.560]  He's, like, Pat Monahan himself.
[46:03.000 --> 46:04.040]  It's, like, that shit,
[46:04.080 --> 46:04.840]  where you just go,
[46:05.220 --> 46:06.300]  man, you're a, like,
[46:06.440 --> 46:07.580]  you're a train guy.
[46:07.580 --> 46:08.040]  Too much train.
[46:08.220 --> 46:09.080]  Yeah, there's a lot.
[46:10.340 --> 46:11.620]  Drops a Jupiter in every throat.
[46:15.080 --> 46:15.620]  Thank you.
[46:17.660 --> 46:18.780]  How are we gonna get...
[46:18.780 --> 46:20.700]  Andrew, you follow the NFL, right?
[46:21.960 --> 46:22.320]  Yeah.
[46:22.500 --> 46:23.180]  Who's your favorite team?
[46:24.940 --> 46:25.660]  Seattle Seahawks.
[46:25.780 --> 46:26.860]  Is that a proximity thing?
[46:26.880 --> 46:27.280]  Yeah, right?
[46:27.700 --> 46:29.100]  Yeah, it's largely a proximity thing.
[46:29.440 --> 46:30.200]  Yeah, when I was a kid,
[46:30.300 --> 46:30.740]  I watched...
[46:30.740 --> 46:31.700]  I'm gonna open these ALF cards
[46:31.700 --> 46:32.120]  while we talk.
[46:32.180 --> 46:32.840]  When I was a kid,
[46:32.840 --> 46:34.660]  I watched a lot of Saints,
[46:35.080 --> 46:35.320]  you know,
[46:35.480 --> 46:36.300]  back when they were called the Aints.
[46:37.300 --> 46:38.940]  And I didn't like them much then.
[46:39.000 --> 46:40.200]  I don't like them much now.
[46:40.420 --> 46:40.880]  No offense.
[46:41.040 --> 46:41.600]  I just...
[46:41.600 --> 46:42.320]  It was the same kind of thing
[46:42.320 --> 46:43.000]  where they were close.
[46:43.620 --> 46:44.240]  I was in Alabama.
[46:44.720 --> 46:45.360]  New Orleans was close.
[46:46.180 --> 46:46.840]  Oh, wow!
[46:47.940 --> 46:48.300]  Oh!
[46:50.760 --> 46:51.480]  Booyah, baseball.
[46:52.060 --> 46:53.160]  Southwick soft shells.
[46:53.600 --> 46:54.640]  I don't care.
[46:54.740 --> 46:55.320]  That's awesome.
[46:55.380 --> 46:55.980]  That is a hit.
[46:56.260 --> 46:57.560]  Gracie, do you know what ALF is?
[46:57.880 --> 46:58.240]  No.
[46:58.420 --> 46:58.940]  Thank you.
[46:58.940 --> 46:59.020]  No.
[47:01.440 --> 47:03.720]  Gracie, if you had to guess what ALF is,
[47:03.820 --> 47:04.800]  what would you guess?
[47:06.320 --> 47:08.140]  It looks like the Muppets.
[47:08.700 --> 47:09.980]  You're not wrong.
[47:11.400 --> 47:13.420]  His thing was that he was an alien
[47:13.420 --> 47:14.960]  and he wanted to eat cats.
[47:15.840 --> 47:16.140]  Yeah.
[47:16.340 --> 47:17.140]  And it was a sitcom.
[47:18.580 --> 47:19.660]  You got a cat.
[47:19.920 --> 47:20.900]  Let's have a snack.
[47:21.160 --> 47:22.560]  You can do anything.
[47:22.920 --> 47:24.440]  Gracie, you can do anything in the 80s.
[47:24.580 --> 47:24.760]  Yeah.
[47:25.160 --> 47:26.280]  Like, for instance,
[47:26.880 --> 47:28.860]  get filmed smoking crack in your underwear
[47:28.860 --> 47:30.460]  with a bunch of dudes on the sofa.
[47:30.700 --> 47:31.960]  And then you can still be on ALF.
[47:32.240 --> 47:33.020]  And still be on ALF.
[47:33.800 --> 47:34.380]  Like Cousin Willie.
[47:36.080 --> 47:37.160]  I can't see the future,
[47:37.500 --> 47:40.500]  but I am getting a rerun of Different Strokes.
[47:41.220 --> 47:41.580]  Also...
[47:41.580 --> 47:42.180]  I'm slamming them!
[47:42.480 --> 47:42.960]  Did you ever see that movie,
[47:43.080 --> 47:43.760]  Permanent Midnight,
[47:44.060 --> 47:44.940]  about that ALF dude?
[47:45.080 --> 47:45.780]  It was Ben Stiller.
[47:46.320 --> 47:47.300]  It was about the guy who made ALF
[47:47.300 --> 47:49.100]  and he was a crazy drug addict,
[47:49.320 --> 47:49.740]  talented dude.
[47:49.920 --> 47:50.620]  Yeah, you should check it out.
[47:50.840 --> 47:51.980]  It's all about him making ALF
[47:52.640 --> 47:54.280]  and being on drugs at the time.
[47:54.420 --> 47:55.280]  Making ALF.
[47:55.440 --> 47:55.940]  Yeah, it was a good movie.
[47:56.040 --> 47:56.420]  Permanent Midnight.
[47:56.780 --> 47:57.060]  Alright.
[47:57.540 --> 47:58.800]  ALF is still around.
[47:59.080 --> 48:00.740]  ALF is not still around.
[48:00.940 --> 48:02.520]  In what way is ALF still around?
[48:03.360 --> 48:05.520]  This summer, he was a guest host
[48:05.520 --> 48:08.660]  on a stream of the Summer Games Fest.
[48:08.880 --> 48:10.620]  For reasons unknown, but he was there.
[48:10.640 --> 48:11.300]  He was a co-host.
[48:11.600 --> 48:13.000]  I was very excited about it.
[48:13.660 --> 48:16.360]  All the way from Melmac
[48:16.920 --> 48:18.880]  to this Games Done Quick Festival.
[48:19.220 --> 48:19.960]  He was!
[48:20.120 --> 48:22.080]  ALF's cameo at Summer Game Fest 2020.
[48:22.760 --> 48:23.420]  What the f...
[48:23.420 --> 48:24.320]  I was very excited.
[48:24.320 --> 48:26.600]  Siamese on Sunrise, Stella.
[48:26.740 --> 48:27.740]  Tuck in the tail.
[48:28.440 --> 48:28.880]  ALF.
[48:29.120 --> 48:30.540]  He always wanted to eat those cats.
[48:31.060 --> 48:33.780]  And then, didn't the last episode of ALF...
[48:33.780 --> 48:34.140]  Yes.
[48:35.500 --> 48:36.380]  What happened?
[48:37.180 --> 48:39.180]  He gets abducted by the government.
[48:39.400 --> 48:40.500]  They capture him.
[48:41.120 --> 48:41.520]  Yeah.
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.740]  But I don't remember if that's the end of the show or the movie.
[48:44.960 --> 48:47.660]  And if the movie expanded beyond his escape.
[48:48.500 --> 48:49.200]  I don't think I've seen the movie.
[48:49.200 --> 48:50.240]  I think it ended dark.
[48:50.900 --> 48:51.380]  It did.
[48:51.380 --> 48:52.060]  Cheer up.
[48:52.180 --> 48:54.400]  We'll stop falling off the couch eventually.
[48:55.640 --> 48:56.120]  And...
[48:56.120 --> 48:57.300]  Oh, these 80s jokes, man.
[48:57.900 --> 49:01.220]  My Earth family doesn't understand me, Doctor.
[49:02.040 --> 49:02.740]  Okay, there you go.
[49:02.840 --> 49:03.280]  That's ALF.
[49:04.040 --> 49:05.120]  Gracie, that's ALF.
[49:07.480 --> 49:08.600]  Gracie doesn't like ALF.
[49:10.380 --> 49:11.340]  Rightfully so.
[49:13.940 --> 49:15.400]  I don't know if there's anything...
[49:15.400 --> 49:17.420]  Honestly, looking at ALF now...
[49:17.420 --> 49:18.140]  I don't know about ALF.
[49:18.260 --> 49:20.220]  Oh, ALF stands for Alien Life Form.
[49:21.800 --> 49:22.860]  ALF is awesome.
[49:23.160 --> 49:24.240]  I don't know about...
[49:24.240 --> 49:24.420]  He is.
[49:24.660 --> 49:25.280]  Oh, I agree.
[49:25.480 --> 49:30.300]  I think maybe we're really stretching the word awesome.
[49:30.680 --> 49:31.300]  Are we, though?
[49:31.380 --> 49:32.160]  You wanna...
[49:32.160 --> 49:32.660]  No.
[49:32.840 --> 49:33.840]  I don't think we are at all.
[49:34.060 --> 49:37.100]  Eric, you need to hear ALF make jokes about microtransactions.
[49:38.600 --> 49:43.400]  Once you see him bring up the microtransaction material, it'll be won over.
[49:43.580 --> 49:45.220]  ALF bringing up microtransact...
[49:45.960 --> 49:47.640]  Is this downloadable content?
[49:48.060 --> 49:48.600]  Alright, cool.
[49:48.680 --> 49:49.280]  Thanks, ALF.
[49:51.560 --> 49:52.880]  ALF's always like this.
[49:53.340 --> 49:54.720]  He moves his hands like this.
[49:54.800 --> 49:57.360]  That's ALF.
[49:58.960 --> 50:00.080]  He was mostly hands.
[50:00.960 --> 50:03.240]  I'm gonna jump into TACSAC.
[50:03.260 --> 50:04.060]  You getting back into it?
[50:04.160 --> 50:04.620]  Alright, let's see.
[50:04.920 --> 50:05.680]  On my grab day...
[50:05.680 --> 50:06.540]  Oh, what is this?
[50:06.700 --> 50:07.840]  DC Skybox?
[50:10.300 --> 50:11.600]  Superman Collector's Edition.
[50:11.740 --> 50:13.620]  The Man of Steel Platinum Series.
[50:13.680 --> 50:14.440]  Well, that's synergistic.
[50:14.840 --> 50:16.800]  Somewhere, I can tell you where.
[50:17.040 --> 50:17.800]  San Francisco.
[50:18.180 --> 50:19.500]  Greg Miller just got an erection.
[50:19.500 --> 50:22.520]  Doesn't know why, but he's happy it's there.
[50:22.580 --> 50:24.080]  He's in the middle of a recording going, huh?
[50:28.800 --> 50:30.080]  My penis tingle.
[50:30.720 --> 50:32.220]  Okay, these are weird cards.
[50:32.380 --> 50:34.800]  These are insane cards.
[50:34.980 --> 50:35.760]  What is this?
[50:37.160 --> 50:38.660]  The guy in the bottom left.
[50:41.680 --> 50:42.940]  Superman, no!
[50:43.380 --> 50:44.160]  I'll tell you what it is.
[50:44.280 --> 50:47.980]  He's doing his best impression of Superman doing the same thing.
[50:49.600 --> 50:50.940]  Those have to go together.
[50:51.020 --> 50:52.800]  Those two cards have to go together.
[50:52.880 --> 50:53.300]  Absolutely.
[50:53.780 --> 50:54.100]  That's fucking great.
[50:54.460 --> 50:56.500]  I gotta find sleeves for this size.
[50:56.880 --> 50:58.360]  Superman hates trains, too.
[50:58.780 --> 50:59.920]  Superman does hate trains.
[51:00.300 --> 51:01.160]  Stop the trains.
[51:01.280 --> 51:02.140]  He says I'm against them.
[51:03.040 --> 51:04.000]  And then...
[51:04.000 --> 51:04.740]  Is that Supergirl?
[51:05.120 --> 51:06.200]  What is that outfit?
[51:06.660 --> 51:08.040]  That is Tina Turner.
[51:08.380 --> 51:08.620]  What?
[51:08.960 --> 51:09.880]  Yeah, it looks like...
[51:10.800 --> 51:11.760]  Maybe, maybe...
[51:11.760 --> 51:13.700]  It's maybe Tina Turner, or it is Tina Turner?
[51:13.700 --> 51:14.600]  I think it's got Tina Turner's hair.
[51:14.840 --> 51:15.080]  Okay.
[51:15.700 --> 51:17.540]  This is from the early 90s.
[51:17.600 --> 51:18.820]  It was just kind of like everything, right?
[51:18.820 --> 51:19.960]  She was in the early 90s.
[51:19.960 --> 51:21.200]  And then...
[51:21.200 --> 51:22.380]  Oh, here's one.
[51:22.720 --> 51:24.360]  They're pointing in the wrong way.
[51:24.680 --> 51:25.940]  Superman is behind them.
[51:26.240 --> 51:28.080]  They're like just pointing at something else.
[51:28.140 --> 51:29.280]  They have no idea that Superman is behind them.
[51:29.280 --> 51:31.240]  Maybe he's going towards whatever it is.
[51:31.500 --> 51:33.860]  And then there's the dumbass dead parents.
[51:34.940 --> 51:36.880]  You know, stupidass dead parents.
[51:37.600 --> 51:39.720]  They figured out how to get Superman to Earth.
[51:40.440 --> 51:41.720]  They're like, you go without us.
[51:41.800 --> 51:42.540]  Yeah, it's fine, you go.
[51:42.560 --> 51:44.040]  They couldn't figure out how to put all three...
[51:44.040 --> 51:45.660]  They can get a baby to Earth.
[51:45.700 --> 51:46.680]  They can't get three people to Earth.
[51:46.800 --> 51:46.940]  Come on.
[51:47.360 --> 51:48.700]  We make a bigger ship?
[51:48.820 --> 51:49.140]  Yeah.
[51:49.500 --> 51:50.120]  Ugh, boring.
[51:51.000 --> 51:51.680]  It's a lack of effort.
[51:51.760 --> 51:52.860]  Do you want to get into these soccer ones?
[51:52.980 --> 51:53.740]  Let's get into these soccer ones.
[51:53.780 --> 51:54.780]  We haven't done the soccer ones.
[51:55.040 --> 51:56.380]  But these are also MLS, right?
[51:56.580 --> 51:57.060]  Yeah, these are MLS.
[51:57.440 --> 51:58.340]  I'll tell you why I bought these.
[51:58.440 --> 51:58.640]  Yeah.
[51:59.040 --> 52:02.620]  I bought these because I was super excited about the Austin FC.
[52:03.480 --> 52:05.140]  And so I bought these and they're not in it.
[52:05.160 --> 52:08.940]  No, they would not be a team by the time these cards came out.
[52:09.320 --> 52:09.440]  Hashtag.
[52:09.740 --> 52:11.480]  There is one card of the stadium.
[52:13.500 --> 52:14.560]  I already bought it online.
[52:14.720 --> 52:16.840]  It's a nice stadium.
[52:16.840 --> 52:17.760]  Doesn't do me any good.
[52:17.800 --> 52:18.420]  It's a great stadium.
[52:18.580 --> 52:19.220]  I'll be going tomorrow.
[52:19.540 --> 52:19.820]  Are you?
[52:20.280 --> 52:21.260]  Yeah, I season tickets.
[52:21.640 --> 52:22.240]  Dude, that's awesome.
[52:22.300 --> 52:22.760]  So does Jack.
[52:23.440 --> 52:25.020]  Although, he'll probably be too sick to go.
[52:25.020 --> 52:25.460]  Oh, yeah.
[52:25.540 --> 52:26.440]  Well, no, he'll probably go.
[52:26.700 --> 52:26.860]  Yeah.
[52:27.020 --> 52:28.900]  I mean, he's pretending so we don't have to go to this.
[52:29.120 --> 52:29.360]  He'll rally.
[52:29.440 --> 52:30.040]  Yeah, exactly.
[52:31.420 --> 52:32.560]  I think we can make it.
[52:32.720 --> 52:33.300]  Nicholas Ladero.
[52:33.660 --> 52:34.180]  Oh, here we go.
[52:35.200 --> 52:35.840]  James Sands.
[52:35.900 --> 52:39.560]  By the way, I have opened a couple boxes of these already and it is hard to find rookies.
[52:39.720 --> 52:40.560]  Like, true rookies in this.
[52:40.560 --> 52:41.940]  I guess there's not a lot of soccer rookies.
[52:41.940 --> 52:42.200]  Yeah.
[52:42.560 --> 52:45.660]  I'm not going to bother reading all these names because I don't know who the fuck they are.
[52:46.920 --> 52:48.000]  Houston Dynamo FC.
[52:48.700 --> 52:49.340]  We're against.
[52:49.640 --> 52:50.540]  We don't like them.
[52:50.880 --> 52:51.840]  We don't like them.
[52:51.880 --> 52:52.000]  Yeah.
[52:52.380 --> 52:53.160]  It's a Texas thing.
[52:53.160 --> 52:53.740]  We don't like Houston.
[52:53.960 --> 52:54.580]  Yeah, we don't like Houston.
[52:54.660 --> 52:55.160]  We don't like Dallas.
[52:55.280 --> 52:55.960]  No, of course not.
[52:56.820 --> 52:57.620]  I'm not from here.
[52:58.040 --> 52:58.800]  Irrespective of soccer.
[52:59.320 --> 52:59.960]  I don't care.
[53:00.040 --> 53:01.720]  I've also been to Houston and Dallas and I don't like them either.
[53:01.800 --> 53:02.280]  They're not great.
[53:02.440 --> 53:02.740]  No, no, no.
[53:02.880 --> 53:03.040]  Yeah.
[53:03.400 --> 53:04.300]  Well, I wouldn't recommend it.
[53:04.340 --> 53:07.340]  Dallas doesn't make any sense to me because the Dallas-Fort Worth area and they're like
[53:07.340 --> 53:07.940]  an hour apart.
[53:08.180 --> 53:08.300]  Yeah.
[53:08.320 --> 53:08.740]  It doesn't...
[53:08.740 --> 53:09.300]  What the...
[53:09.300 --> 53:10.900]  We're two cities, but we're one name.
[53:10.900 --> 53:10.980]  Yeah.
[53:11.160 --> 53:11.960]  It's like that's not...
[53:11.960 --> 53:12.220]  Come on.
[53:12.320 --> 53:13.920]  That's like going like, oh, Austin, C, and Antonio.
[53:14.100 --> 53:14.720]  It's like, no, no, no.
[53:14.720 --> 53:15.240]  No, no, no.
[53:15.260 --> 53:15.940]  No, there's two.
[53:16.240 --> 53:16.400]  Yeah.
[53:16.880 --> 53:17.240]  Stupid.
[53:18.120 --> 53:18.760]  Brian Rodriguez.
[53:20.200 --> 53:20.920]  Aaron Long.
[53:21.360 --> 53:21.600]  Ooh.
[53:22.880 --> 53:23.980]  Paul Ruiz-Diaz.
[53:24.020 --> 53:24.600]  That's pretty.
[53:24.740 --> 53:25.260]  Look at these all.
[53:25.660 --> 53:26.020]  Ooh.
[53:27.380 --> 53:27.920]  I can...
[53:27.920 --> 53:30.320]  Is that the kid who's like 15?
[53:31.440 --> 53:33.360]  If that dude is 15, he's been a...
[53:33.360 --> 53:35.760]  He's on the Seattle or Portland?
[53:36.280 --> 53:36.500]  Yeah.
[53:37.040 --> 53:37.800]  He was born in...
[53:37.800 --> 53:39.980]  That's that kid who like scored against us, right?
[53:40.120 --> 53:41.420]  He was born in 1990.
[53:42.540 --> 53:42.940]  He...
[53:42.940 --> 53:47.560]  We watched him play, and he is very good.
[53:48.040 --> 53:50.000]  New York Bulls, Chicago Fire.
[53:50.620 --> 53:54.280]  Well, I would expect to even to make it into the MLS, you'd have to be pretty good.
[53:55.280 --> 53:56.540]  I mean, yeah, I guess.
[53:56.720 --> 53:56.960]  I don't know if it...
[53:56.960 --> 53:57.440]  You just have to...
[53:57.440 --> 53:58.400]  Like on what scale?
[53:58.680 --> 54:01.920]  I mean, you have to be pretty good compared to high school.
[54:01.920 --> 54:02.420]  Andrew Panton.
[54:02.720 --> 54:06.280]  Yeah, you have to be good compared to most kids who play high school, but not so good
[54:06.280 --> 54:09.080]  that you make, you know, like an actual team.
[54:09.160 --> 54:10.960]  Not so good that you'd go overseas and play for them.
[54:10.980 --> 54:11.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[54:11.760 --> 54:12.520]  In a real league.
[54:12.700 --> 54:12.880]  Okay.
[54:14.620 --> 54:16.320]  Not so good that you'd end up in the Bundesliga.
[54:16.700 --> 54:16.820]  Yeah.
[54:17.440 --> 54:20.100]  Romo Quinteto, Julian Gressel.
[54:20.420 --> 54:21.240]  Oh, here we go.
[54:22.080 --> 54:22.800]  Andre Blake.
[54:22.900 --> 54:23.680]  That's a pretty card.
[54:23.800 --> 54:24.300]  He's a tall...
[54:24.840 --> 54:25.340]  Is he a keeper?
[54:25.520 --> 54:26.520]  Dude, he looks like a keeper.
[54:27.460 --> 54:28.460]  Got long keeper arms.
[54:30.040 --> 54:30.760]  Alexander Ring.
[54:30.840 --> 54:32.360]  I think the gloves make your hands look bigger.
[54:32.580 --> 54:33.500]  That's our captain!
[54:33.800 --> 54:34.740]  Hey, Alexander Ring!
[54:34.740 --> 54:36.520]  He's the captain of Austin FC.
[54:36.820 --> 54:37.460]  There we go.
[54:37.960 --> 54:38.320]  Alright!
[54:38.760 --> 54:39.120]  What's a hit?
[54:39.120 --> 54:40.260]  Yeah, that's a good pull!
[54:40.500 --> 54:41.800]  He scored a goal last night.
[54:41.880 --> 54:42.340]  Hell yeah, he did.
[54:42.700 --> 54:43.440]  Or, well, last time.
[54:43.440 --> 54:43.680]  Wednesday.
[54:43.900 --> 54:44.140]  Wednesday.
[54:44.320 --> 54:44.680]  There you go.
[54:45.700 --> 54:47.120]  And who are we playing this weekend?
[54:47.640 --> 54:48.460]  Who are we playing?
[54:49.140 --> 54:49.500]  Portland.
[54:49.500 --> 54:49.680]  Portland.
[54:49.920 --> 54:51.680]  Oh, the Timber or something like that?
[54:51.780 --> 54:52.000]  What are they?
[54:52.340 --> 54:52.500]  Yeah.
[54:53.620 --> 54:54.260]  That's awesome.
[54:54.340 --> 54:54.780]  You got Ring.
[54:54.920 --> 54:55.540]  That's very cool.
[54:55.760 --> 54:56.320]  That's a great pull.
[54:56.400 --> 54:57.080]  That's an FC guy.
[54:57.800 --> 54:58.240]  Hell yeah.
[54:58.600 --> 54:59.240]  I'm very happy for him.
[54:59.240 --> 54:59.800]  Local boy.
[55:00.700 --> 55:01.980]  I mean, he plays for us.
[55:02.060 --> 55:02.760]  I don't know if he's from here.
[55:02.760 --> 55:04.460]  The last six months or whatever.
[55:06.360 --> 55:06.760]  Flipper.
[55:07.440 --> 55:09.760]  Okay, we have here Lucas Zellerion.
[55:10.960 --> 55:12.500]  We have Miles Robinson.
[55:13.020 --> 55:13.420]  He...
[55:13.420 --> 55:14.940]  Alright, well, that's a fun play.
[55:15.380 --> 55:17.760]  I don't know if you guys can get in deep enough, but that is a very...
[55:18.340 --> 55:21.100]  He looks horrified in his face.
[55:21.200 --> 55:21.460]  Look at that.
[55:21.460 --> 55:22.120]  Look at that up close.
[55:24.380 --> 55:25.980]  That's going in one of our collections.
[55:28.220 --> 55:29.640]  Oh, Ola Kamara.
[55:31.420 --> 55:32.800]  It's got a flag.
[55:33.280 --> 55:34.220]  What flag is that?
[55:37.770 --> 55:39.070]  It's the flags of Foundation.
[55:39.390 --> 55:39.830]  Fantastic.
[55:40.430 --> 55:40.870]  Fantastic.
[55:41.250 --> 55:42.950]  And this one...
[55:42.950 --> 55:44.490]  And this one...
[55:45.310 --> 55:46.190]  Christian Torres.
[55:48.110 --> 55:48.670]  Are you excited?
[55:48.970 --> 55:50.790]  He didn't score a point for us.
[55:51.130 --> 55:51.510]  Sorry, bud.
[55:53.090 --> 55:55.510]  Moving along, I don't know much about soccer.
[55:55.910 --> 55:56.510]  That's alright.
[55:57.450 --> 55:58.330]  I'll tell you what I know about it.
[55:58.450 --> 55:59.810]  I know it's affordable and I can buy it.
[56:00.190 --> 56:00.770]  Uh-huh.
[56:02.130 --> 56:02.870]  It's weird.
[56:02.970 --> 56:03.770]  These cards aren't moving.
[56:04.110 --> 56:04.370]  Yeah.
[56:05.490 --> 56:06.530]  Sebastian Letget.
[56:07.290 --> 56:08.150]  What's his name?
[56:08.750 --> 56:09.990]  Chris Wondolowski.
[56:11.990 --> 56:13.030]  That guy.
[56:13.150 --> 56:13.930]  That's a pretty card.
[56:14.270 --> 56:15.670]  I feel like soccer players...
[56:15.670 --> 56:17.130]  All these cards are very intense.
[56:17.450 --> 56:19.090]  Everybody looks very serious.
[56:19.350 --> 56:20.810]  There's always something going on.
[56:21.750 --> 56:24.170]  These are 22 under 22s.
[56:24.610 --> 56:26.230]  And then Tanner Tessman.
[56:26.290 --> 56:27.950]  I wonder if that's like a rookie cup type thing.
[56:28.050 --> 56:28.650]  22 under 22.
[56:29.470 --> 56:30.830]  I bet there's only 22 of them as well.
[56:31.090 --> 56:31.810]  That's two of them right there.
[56:31.890 --> 56:32.850]  You found them all.
[56:33.050 --> 56:33.650]  10% of them.
[56:33.650 --> 56:34.210]  You're getting there.
[56:34.410 --> 56:35.030]  Entire population.
[56:38.610 --> 56:40.910]  Are there supposed to be autos in this, Geoff?
[56:41.070 --> 56:43.530]  Yeah, there'll be autos and probably some relics and stuff too.
[56:45.850 --> 56:46.570]  Gonzalo Higuain.
[56:48.550 --> 56:49.270]  Jurgen Locadia.
[56:50.810 --> 56:51.170]  Darlington.
[56:52.610 --> 56:53.250]  Four o'clock.
[56:54.650 --> 56:55.510]  You know what that means?
[56:55.650 --> 56:57.330]  It means it's time to give the dog his pill.
[56:57.330 --> 56:58.650]  Oh, okay, cool.
[56:59.250 --> 57:01.570]  Millie, give the dog the pill.
[57:01.710 --> 57:02.290]  Millie's in school.
[57:02.490 --> 57:03.730]  Oh, no!
[57:04.350 --> 57:04.610]  I know.
[57:05.270 --> 57:06.010]  Here we go, Nani.
[57:06.170 --> 57:06.670]  I've heard of him.
[57:07.270 --> 57:08.510]  And this is a refractor.
[57:09.530 --> 57:10.290]  That's a pretty card.
[57:10.870 --> 57:11.330]  Pretty cool.
[57:11.630 --> 57:12.330]  Pretty cool.
[57:13.250 --> 57:14.610]  This guy and then this guy.
[57:14.710 --> 57:15.570]  Is that guy's name Kevin Precious?
[57:15.930 --> 57:16.430]  I can't read that.
[57:17.170 --> 57:17.650]  Kevin...
[57:19.330 --> 57:20.290]  Kevin Paredes.
[57:20.910 --> 57:21.330]  And then...
[57:24.730 --> 57:25.210]  Tryvon...
[57:25.210 --> 57:26.630]  Does it say Pitch Prodigies?
[57:27.570 --> 57:28.950]  It says Pitch Prodigies.
[57:28.990 --> 57:30.070]  Yeah, it should say Pitch Perfect.
[57:30.390 --> 57:31.090]  Pitch Perfect.
[57:31.190 --> 57:31.550]  Just saying.
[57:32.310 --> 57:32.790]  You're right.
[57:33.110 --> 57:33.570]  Just saying.
[57:34.310 --> 57:35.250]  Something to think about, I guess.
[57:35.670 --> 57:36.790]  Is this our last MLS pack?
[57:36.850 --> 57:37.390]  This is our last MLS pack.
[57:37.390 --> 57:37.870]  Oh, wow.
[57:38.690 --> 57:39.410]  In this box.
[57:39.470 --> 57:40.030]  We got more over here.
[57:40.230 --> 57:41.470]  Oh, thank God.
[57:41.630 --> 57:42.270]  Yeah, I don't want you to...
[57:42.930 --> 57:44.290]  There has to be an Otto in this?
[57:44.350 --> 57:45.410]  Or like a relic of some kind?
[57:45.450 --> 57:46.290]  Or have we missed it?
[57:47.050 --> 57:48.510]  It might be in the Sacky Packy.
[57:48.650 --> 57:49.290]  I don't...
[57:49.290 --> 57:50.270]  It might be in the Sack Pack...
[57:50.270 --> 57:50.910]  The Pack Sack, yeah.
[57:52.010 --> 57:52.650]  Jonathan Santos.
[57:53.970 --> 57:54.610]  Christian Espinosa.
[57:54.810 --> 57:55.390]  Oh, here we go.
[57:55.390 --> 57:56.210]  Gustave Bou.
[57:56.650 --> 57:58.390]  That's one of those retro cards.
[57:58.510 --> 57:58.910]  It's a cool looking card.
[58:01.470 --> 58:02.310]  Teal Bunbury.
[58:03.250 --> 58:05.030]  I just noticed these are T.O.P.S. cards.
[58:05.210 --> 58:05.670]  Yumi Chara.
[58:06.570 --> 58:08.490]  They're in the top left of every one.
[58:08.670 --> 58:10.110]  It just registered with me.
[58:10.470 --> 58:10.590]  Yep.
[58:10.730 --> 58:10.970]  Wow.
[58:11.690 --> 58:12.030]  Okay.
[58:12.210 --> 58:13.460]  It's T.O.P.S., maybe...
[58:13.930 --> 58:16.290]  Do you think Adam is watching this from England right now?
[58:16.590 --> 58:17.470]  He better not be.
[58:17.730 --> 58:18.870]  He's absolutely not.
[58:18.990 --> 58:19.710]  It was a dumb question.
[58:19.770 --> 58:20.470]  It was a rhetorical question.
[58:21.710 --> 58:22.370]  Son of a bitch.
[58:23.090 --> 58:24.810]  Let's open up our extra pack, just to see.
[58:24.810 --> 58:25.430]  Let's do it.
[58:26.090 --> 58:27.570]  He's absolutely not.
[58:27.630 --> 58:28.110]  Okay, cool.
[58:29.410 --> 58:31.470]  He doesn't even know we're doing it.
[58:31.550 --> 58:32.970]  That's probably true.
[58:33.350 --> 58:35.710]  I mean, that's absolutely probably true.
[58:36.330 --> 58:37.230]  Ayo Ekinola.
[58:37.450 --> 58:38.170]  That's a rookie card.
[58:39.470 --> 58:40.650]  Alejandro Bedoya.
[58:41.090 --> 58:42.270]  Maxi Morales.
[58:43.030 --> 58:43.870]  Edison Flores.
[58:45.090 --> 58:46.490]  Edison Flores again.
[58:46.690 --> 58:47.250]  What the hell?
[58:47.690 --> 58:48.130]  What's that?
[58:48.370 --> 58:50.690]  And then Zachary Brault-Gouliard.
[58:51.650 --> 58:52.630]  Julia Goulia.
[58:52.990 --> 58:54.110]  Brian Rodriguez.
[58:55.550 --> 58:57.810]  And then Pitch Perfect.
[58:59.390 --> 58:59.750]  Prodigy.
[58:59.750 --> 59:00.550]  He looks very unhappy.
[59:00.610 --> 59:01.250]  Mason Toy.
[59:01.470 --> 59:03.830]  Yeah, because he's got to be a Pitch Prodigy and not Pitch Perfect.
[59:03.950 --> 59:04.390]  It's bullshit.
[59:04.510 --> 59:04.950]  It's stupid.
[59:05.130 --> 59:06.810]  He's on the phone with his fucking agent right now, probably.
[59:06.830 --> 59:08.930]  Do you think people watching this got the Julia Goulia thing or no?
[59:09.370 --> 59:10.250]  No, I don't think so.
[59:10.310 --> 59:10.690]  Okay, cool. Just making sure.
[59:10.790 --> 59:11.490]  I don't think so.
[59:11.550 --> 59:11.690]  Cool.
[59:11.970 --> 59:12.590]  That's okay, though.
[59:12.890 --> 59:17.810]  Do you think they'll understand what the Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band...
[59:18.430 --> 59:21.330]  Yeah, that's sort of... I mean, that's in sort of...
[59:21.330 --> 59:23.110]  You know, I should point out, too.
[59:23.110 --> 59:28.790]  I think that a lot of these over here, like the Alf and this one, were sent in by a comment leaver, I believe.
[59:28.870 --> 59:29.190]  Oh, really?
[59:29.410 --> 59:31.510]  Yeah, I think a comment leaver mailed us a bunch of cards they found.
[59:31.710 --> 59:31.770]  Yeah.
[59:33.010 --> 59:34.810]  Oh, boy. That gum is a part of it.
[59:35.010 --> 59:35.050]  Uh-oh.
[59:35.810 --> 59:37.150]  Okay, we'll just leave that on.
[59:37.670 --> 59:38.250]  All right, so we have...
[59:38.250 --> 59:39.270]  All right, so what's your gum card?
[59:40.290 --> 59:42.490]  Our gum card is...
[59:42.490 --> 59:43.290]  Really a gum card.
[59:43.650 --> 59:47.070]  ...between LHCB and future villains.
[59:48.650 --> 59:50.710]  Is that like a school to become a villain?
[59:50.910 --> 59:51.950]  You're not there yet.
[59:52.550 --> 59:53.890]  All right, the gum card...
[59:54.870 --> 59:57.590]  Are we gonna hang on to it? Are you gonna... Oh, that's a good idea.
[59:57.750 --> 59:58.570]  We're gonna sleeve the gum card.
[59:58.590 --> 59:59.650]  Yeah, we have to sleeve the gum card.
[59:59.810 --> 01:00:00.830]  You might get this gum card.
[01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:10.230]  You might get this gum card, or we'll hold on to it till a period in time in the future when we've developed gum extraction technology.
[01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:13.430]  We can safely remove it from this miscut card.
[01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:17.650]  I think Gavin needs to chew into a gum piece of my choice.
[01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:21.210]  Oh, that's true. That might be... Oh, boy.
[01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:24.270]  Leaving Heartland, and then you can see...
[01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.070]  George Harrison, I guess.
[01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:34.570]  And then LHCB record their demo record.
[01:00:35.010 --> 01:00:36.410]  This pack of cards sucks.
[01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:38.230]  All the benefit of Heartland.
[01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:39.890]  I hate these. These suck.
[01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:42.290]  The parade for the benefit.
[01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:46.810]  Oh, there we go. Sergeant Pepper Weathervane comes to life.
[01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:48.430]  All right, no hits.
[01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:51.610]  I believe he's reacting to Superman lifting a car.
[01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:53.750]  Save that.
[01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:56.670]  We can make a story out of all the people pointing at each other.
[01:00:56.810 --> 01:01:01.030]  Hey, you were talking about Gavin and how he has to chew some gum.
[01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:05.150]  Brian, can we change Andrew's picture to what he's requested?
[01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:06.850]  Is that possible?
[01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:11.670]  Okay, we're gonna make a change here on Andrew's image.
[01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:18.070]  This is something he requested of me, and we just wanted to keep it so we could see.
[01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:21.690]  Yeah, well, I didn't want to rub it in. It's just Gavin's not there.
[01:01:21.810 --> 01:01:24.170]  I wanted him to show that we were thinking of him.
[01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:26.730]  So it's just the current, the outskirts rankings.
[01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:30.630]  I'm clearly first. We don't need to make too much of a point of that.
[01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:32.590]  But yeah, Gavin. Gavin right there.
[01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:34.290]  Yep. And also Trevor.
[01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:39.390]  Yep. Well, there are other people on the list too, but I think the main point is Gavin.
[01:01:40.410 --> 01:01:43.570]  Look at how far ahead you are from Trevor.
[01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:45.870]  You did it in 3 minutes and 39 seconds.
[01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:51.010]  And if I'm reading this properly, Trevor did it in an hour and 40 minutes and 39 seconds, though.
[01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:52.670]  He nailed the 39 part.
[01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:54.690]  Catch up, Trevor.
[01:01:55.030 --> 01:01:56.050]  Jesus Christ, man.
[01:01:56.350 --> 01:01:59.910]  All right, we're gonna open now a box of Tops Gypsy Queen 2021.
[01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:01.610]  So what are these?
[01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:03.670]  These are baseball cards.
[01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:08.990]  Gypsy Queen is a popular Tops sub-brand, similar to Allen & Ginter.
[01:02:09.490 --> 01:02:12.430]  It is a little higher in quality.
[01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:14.410]  It's still paper. They're thick cards.
[01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:18.530]  And they're full of just hard-to-determine parallels.
[01:02:18.730 --> 01:02:19.690]  Like, they don't make any sense.
[01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:22.770]  Right. So when I said, what are these? And you said baseball cards.
[01:02:23.090 --> 01:02:26.050]  The second part where you continue to answer, that's what I meant.
[01:02:26.090 --> 01:02:27.210]  Well, I started with baseball cards.
[01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:27.670]  Right, yeah.
[01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:28.670]  The very first thing they are.
[01:02:29.290 --> 01:02:31.170]  That's the very first thing they are.
[01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:33.170]  And people keep asking me, can you say the word gypsy?
[01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:35.090]  Isn't that an insult?
[01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:36.830]  And I guess it's not because it's on the boxes.
[01:02:37.030 --> 01:02:38.030]  I think it's how you say it.
[01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:39.890]  I don't... okay.
[01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:40.610]  But I don't know.
[01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:41.630]  I don't know either.
[01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:43.230]  But it says it's like...
[01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:45.030]  It's right here, Tops Gypsy Queen.
[01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:47.470]  I don't think it's offensive if it's on packaging.
[01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:52.970]  I don't know that we're the people to delineate where it is and is not.
[01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:54.330]  I don't know. I just don't know.
[01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:56.030]  I just...
[01:02:56.830 --> 01:02:57.190]  It's...
[01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.810]  I don't know what I'm saying.
[01:02:58.210 --> 01:02:59.210]  We got Chris Davis to start it.
[01:02:59.250 --> 01:03:00.210]  Chris Davis to start it.
[01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:01.810]  Now, this might be a parallel.
[01:03:01.930 --> 01:03:02.550]  I don't know.
[01:03:02.830 --> 01:03:04.310]  Because their parallels are stupid in this.
[01:03:04.310 --> 01:03:04.830]  I don't know what that means.
[01:03:05.030 --> 01:03:08.270]  Is it possible that this is what lost Tops the baseball license?
[01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:09.290]  It's probably, yeah.
[01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:12.610]  They refused to let go of the Gypsy Queen.
[01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:16.550]  Nate Pearson is a pitcher.
[01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:17.210]  Really good rookie.
[01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:17.810]  That's a good card.
[01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:21.290]  There's McKinstry, rookie.
[01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:23.990]  Robinson Cano, card.
[01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:27.370]  Oh, here's Carrasco.
[01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:29.450]  That's a green parallel.
[01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:31.250]  I think Rendon is out for the rest of the season.
[01:03:31.810 --> 01:03:32.810]  I think he's done this year.
[01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:35.130]  And then, that's Miguel San...
[01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:38.850]  And then if you look on the back, you have to look and see, like, are they different in any way?
[01:03:39.070 --> 01:03:40.230]  Are they different from what?
[01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:41.190]  Each other.
[01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:42.410]  What does that mean?
[01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:46.790]  Like, this GQ could be a different color than these, and it would be a parallel.
[01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:50.230]  Or it could just not say 2021 on it.
[01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:51.950]  What does that do?
[01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:54.870]  It just means it's rare and worth more.
[01:03:55.590 --> 01:04:01.510]  Like, instead of having a number on the front of, like, one of 75, there's no GQ at the top left.
[01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:02.870]  Okay, so this one's green.
[01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:04.550]  Does that mean it's worth money?
[01:04:04.810 --> 01:04:04.950]  Yeah.
[01:04:05.350 --> 01:04:07.550]  Which means it's rarer than the base version.
[01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:09.130]  It seems very weird.
[01:04:09.490 --> 01:04:13.690]  It just means that there's, like, let's say there's 10,000 of the base card.
[01:04:13.810 --> 01:04:15.730]  If the green one, then maybe there's 4,000.
[01:04:15.970 --> 01:04:16.430]  Oh, okay.
[01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:18.550]  Cards are weird, man.
[01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:19.290]  Cards are weird, man.
[01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:20.590]  Only getting weirder.
[01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.950]  Clay Aiken.
[01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:26.270]  Reesoskins.
[01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:27.450]  I was just going to make up names.
[01:04:29.530 --> 01:04:30.250]  The Gronk.
[01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:32.950]  Kyle Kubrick.
[01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:34.430]  Chris Kubrick.
[01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:36.030]  Chris Bubick.
[01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:40.270]  Shin Yamaguchi.
[01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:42.030]  Randy Rosarino.
[01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:44.210]  I like a Rosarino at the beginning of the season.
[01:04:44.350 --> 01:04:44.810]  I don't know how he's doing.
[01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:46.770]  A Rosarino, he's doing okay.
[01:04:47.110 --> 01:04:48.370]  This does not count as a rookie card.
[01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:50.570]  He had one last year, but he is up for Rookie of the Year.
[01:04:50.570 --> 01:04:51.130]  I believe.
[01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:52.210]  He's the frontrunner right now.
[01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:53.910]  And then the Mookie Mookie Betts.
[01:04:54.370 --> 01:04:54.870]  He is...
[01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:55.550]  Signed a big contract.
[01:04:55.690 --> 01:04:56.910]  I think he's batting, like, 7-3.
[01:04:57.110 --> 01:04:59.410]  I think he's hurt right now.
[01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:02.850]  He's been out with a hip contusion or something.
[01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:06.110]  Good dude, that.
[01:05:06.110 --> 01:05:06.990]  Cool dude, that, Mookie Betts.
[01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.630]  I mean, I hate the Dodgers, but I like him.
[01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:13.250]  I've started following the Dodgers because my girlfriend's family is...
[01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:13.770]  They're Dodgers fans.
[01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:14.710]  They're L.A. people, so...
[01:05:16.450 --> 01:05:16.670]  Yeah.
[01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:19.170]  They're no White Sox, but they're okay.
[01:05:20.590 --> 01:05:21.710]  Big Matt Olsen, all right.
[01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:22.430]  Big Matt Olsen.
[01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:23.950]  We got...
[01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:25.210]  Luis Castillo.
[01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:27.450]  We have...
[01:05:27.450 --> 01:05:28.030]  Oh, this is a rookie.
[01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:29.290]  This is Ryan Geoffers.
[01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:31.830]  We have...
[01:05:32.490 --> 01:05:33.210]  George Springer.
[01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:36.230]  What is this?
[01:05:36.330 --> 01:05:37.630]  This is Ryan Castellani.
[01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:38.650]  That's a rookie.
[01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:40.470]  And it's green, Eric.
[01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:41.110]  Wow!
[01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:44.290]  Coney Whitley.
[01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:45.770]  I don't know who that is.
[01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:46.810]  And then...
[01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:47.430]  Oh, Nick Magical.
[01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:50.470]  He's doing pretty well, actually.
[01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:51.310]  Yeah, he's having a season.
[01:05:52.310 --> 01:05:52.710]  Good one.
[01:05:52.770 --> 01:05:53.390]  I mean, those...
[01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:55.170]  The White Sox are having a time.
[01:05:55.170 --> 01:05:55.670]  Having a season.
[01:05:55.790 --> 01:05:56.470]  I mean, it's...
[01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:58.430]  Their coaching is...
[01:05:59.610 --> 01:05:59.890]  What?
[01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:04.010]  I'm not a big La Russa guy.
[01:06:05.130 --> 01:06:05.890]  It sounded like you were saying,
[01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:07.190]  La Russa.
[01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:09.250]  No, I don't think anyone was saying that.
[01:06:09.810 --> 01:06:10.010]  No.
[01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:11.590]  No, I don't think anybody was saying that.
[01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:12.570]  La Russa.
[01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:12.770]  No.
[01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:14.230]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:15.510]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:17.590]  It was a controversial hire, that Tony Russo.
[01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:18.230]  Jesus, yeah.
[01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:19.270]  Right, yeah.
[01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:19.630]  Yeah.
[01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:21.730]  Controversial is a nice way of putting it.
[01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:24.430]  Davey Garcia rookie.
[01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:25.430]  I don't know him.
[01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:26.470]  Ooh, Paul Goldschmidt.
[01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:26.790]  Paul Goldschmidt.
[01:06:26.790 --> 01:06:28.190]  Glad we got him out of the division.
[01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:29.510]  Used to be a Diamondback.
[01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:31.190]  Then we got Smat.
[01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:32.410]  Smat.
[01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:33.190]  Kodor.
[01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:34.570]  Not related.
[01:06:34.610 --> 01:06:35.310]  He's related to Hodor.
[01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:37.170]  Yeah.
[01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:39.910]  Runed Odor.
[01:06:40.610 --> 01:06:40.890]  Hodor.
[01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:43.530]  Corbin...
[01:06:43.530 --> 01:06:45.290]  Oh, Corbin Bernson from LA Law.
[01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:46.070]  Yeah.
[01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.630]  Green.
[01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:48.910]  Then...
[01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:50.270]  Dylan Bundy.
[01:06:51.310 --> 01:06:52.090]  Al Bundy.
[01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:53.270]  Related to...
[01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:55.150]  And then Corbin Bernson.
[01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:55.550]  You got...
[01:06:55.550 --> 01:06:57.370]  Oh, you got the one, but the other one is green.
[01:06:58.370 --> 01:06:58.850]  Oh, yeah.
[01:06:59.030 --> 01:06:59.950]  It's the exact same card.
[01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:00.210]  There you go.
[01:07:00.330 --> 01:07:00.870]  Look at you.
[01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:01.530]  There you go.
[01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:02.650]  Parallel.
[01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:03.590]  Look at you.
[01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:05.150]  Look at you.
[01:07:05.370 --> 01:07:05.990]  You did it.
[01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:06.790]  Look at us.
[01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:08.590]  Guys, look at us.
[01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:09.390]  Look at us.
[01:07:10.310 --> 01:07:11.670]  Now you can see the difference.
[01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:12.590]  Oh, thank God.
[01:07:12.590 --> 01:07:15.250]  And then we'll look on the back and we'll see, are any of these different in any way?
[01:07:15.330 --> 01:07:15.930]  Don't appear to be.
[01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:17.450]  Cool.
[01:07:19.590 --> 01:07:20.530]  I don't like the way you say that.
[01:07:20.530 --> 01:07:21.010]  Are these...
[01:07:21.010 --> 01:07:22.570]  I'm not much of a baseball fan.
[01:07:22.650 --> 01:07:24.970]  Are these exciting to you guys as baseball fans?
[01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:30.310]  I'm excited to see what is in the next pack, but then we open them and I get less excited as we go.
[01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:32.310]  They're exactly as exciting as every pack I've opened.
[01:07:32.810 --> 01:07:35.610]  El Garcia, which for me is very exciting.
[01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:37.190]  Brian Buxton.
[01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:37.990]  Mike Trout.
[01:07:38.070 --> 01:07:38.930]  Hey, all right.
[01:07:39.090 --> 01:07:39.490]  Big T.
[01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:40.210]  Bradford.
[01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:41.050]  Oh!
[01:07:43.110 --> 01:07:43.830]  Bryce Harper.
[01:07:44.610 --> 01:07:45.330]  Bryce Harper.
[01:07:45.790 --> 01:07:47.870]  It looks like a tarot card.
[01:07:48.050 --> 01:07:49.630]  Yeah, look at that.
[01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:50.950]  I get kind of like Pokemon vibes.
[01:07:51.870 --> 01:07:52.530]  That's pretty.
[01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:54.810]  Bryce Harper, my favorite Pokemon.
[01:07:56.110 --> 01:07:56.870]  Oh, shit.
[01:07:57.050 --> 01:07:57.930]  And then a Walker Bueller.
[01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.890]  All right.
[01:07:59.310 --> 01:08:02.230]  Let's say the second year card for him, I think.
[01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.810]  Third year.
[01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:03.630]  He's a young guy.
[01:08:04.610 --> 01:08:05.510]  Oh, there we go.
[01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:06.110]  There's another one.
[01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.930]  Oh, is that Cronenworth?
[01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:07.590]  Jake Cronenworth.
[01:08:07.590 --> 01:08:08.230]  All right.
[01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:09.210]  Should have been Rookie of the Year.
[01:08:09.290 --> 01:08:09.670]  That's okay.
[01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:10.150]  It's all right.
[01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:11.370]  You can put him anywhere in the infield.
[01:08:11.490 --> 01:08:12.510]  The guy's an elite player.
[01:08:12.690 --> 01:08:13.410]  He's an all-star.
[01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:17.730]  He really showed that he's the key player in that trade we made.
[01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:18.270]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:19.970]  Are you being serious about that?
[01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:20.430]  A hundred percent.
[01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:20.690]  Okay.
[01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:22.050]  He's a very talented young guy.
[01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.510]  He's fantastic.
[01:08:22.990 --> 01:08:23.350]  Swanson.
[01:08:23.830 --> 01:08:25.070]  He is pretty good.
[01:08:25.210 --> 01:08:26.710]  I'm excited about that tarot card insert.
[01:08:26.710 --> 01:08:27.850]  I wonder how rare that is.
[01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:30.830]  Was that exciting enough for you, Andrew?
[01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:32.350]  Yeah, see, we got excited about the tarot card.
[01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:33.270]  Well, yeah.
[01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:36.990]  I'd say so far my highlights of these have been a guy that looks like Johnny Hendricks
[01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:38.810]  and a Pokemon baseball card.
[01:08:41.850 --> 01:08:42.250]  Bobichette.
[01:08:43.650 --> 01:08:45.390]  Did his dad play for the Rockies?
[01:08:45.690 --> 01:08:46.090]  Bobichette?
[01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:46.570]  Yeah.
[01:08:46.850 --> 01:08:47.090]  Did he?
[01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:48.230]  Is he a second-year guy?
[01:08:48.570 --> 01:08:49.630]  He is a second-year guy.
[01:08:50.050 --> 01:08:52.810]  He was up for rookie of the year last year.
[01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:53.290]  He did not get it.
[01:08:53.690 --> 01:08:55.590]  He looks like Roy Big Country Nelson.
[01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.150]  That guy.
[01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:56.950]  He does.
[01:08:57.190 --> 01:08:58.230]  Cody Bellinger.
[01:08:58.910 --> 01:09:02.170]  Speaking of batting seventh, I think he's batting eighth or ninth right now.
[01:09:02.190 --> 01:09:03.110]  He's going through a slump.
[01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:03.590]  That's good.
[01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:04.170]  I hate Cody Bellinger.
[01:09:04.190 --> 01:09:06.370]  Oh, there's Bryce Harper.
[01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:08.750]  This is a tobacco card.
[01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:10.850]  You got a lot of Bryce Harper stuff.
[01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:11.730]  This is cool.
[01:09:12.810 --> 01:09:13.990]  It's a smaller card?
[01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:15.150]  It's cool because it's less of a card?
[01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:16.110]  Yeah.
[01:09:16.770 --> 01:09:17.590]  Maybe because it's rare.
[01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:18.470]  It's less card.
[01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.790]  Yeah.
[01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:20.250]  They gave you even less card.
[01:09:20.370 --> 01:09:22.270]  This is like the opposite of those Superman cards you got.
[01:09:22.350 --> 01:09:23.870]  They gave us less card but more value.
[01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:25.170]  I don't know about that.
[01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:28.510]  Al Bundy again.
[01:09:28.850 --> 01:09:29.710]  You got that one?
[01:09:30.810 --> 01:09:31.510]  You already had that one.
[01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:31.910]  Justin Turner.
[01:09:32.350 --> 01:09:33.290]  He's got a lot of beard.
[01:09:33.730 --> 01:09:34.850]  And then Matt Brantley?
[01:09:35.010 --> 01:09:35.290]  Is that right?
[01:09:35.290 --> 01:09:35.870]  Michael Brantley.
[01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:36.570]  Matt Brantley.
[01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:38.410]  Went to high school with me.
[01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:40.370]  Do you see a baseball card?
[01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:41.070]  I hope so.
[01:09:41.190 --> 01:09:42.290]  A guy you went to high school with?
[01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:44.030]  I remember he drove a Harley in high school.
[01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:45.350]  That's awesome!
[01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:49.070]  And I imagine things continued in that trajectory.
[01:09:49.210 --> 01:09:50.370]  Yeah, I would assume so.
[01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:51.810]  Alabama guy riding a Harley?
[01:09:52.090 --> 01:09:52.470]  In high school.
[01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:52.750]  Yeah.
[01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:53.210]  10th grade.
[01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:53.710]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:54.390]  Oh, Jesus.
[01:09:56.610 --> 01:09:58.510]  Oh, this is...
[01:09:58.510 --> 01:09:58.710]  Yeah.
[01:09:58.750 --> 01:09:59.430]  Albert Abreu.
[01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:00.650]  Rookie.
[01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:02.430]  Then we have...
[01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:04.630]  For the Phillies, we have...
[01:10:06.190 --> 01:10:09.450]  Oh, what is this?
[01:10:09.670 --> 01:10:10.870]  Pete Alonzo card.
[01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:12.410]  Pete Alonzo used to be pretty...
[01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:13.310]  I mean, he's still pretty good.
[01:10:13.570 --> 01:10:16.070]  If he was on my team, I think I'd be into him.
[01:10:16.350 --> 01:10:16.490]  Yeah.
[01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:19.670]  He's on a decline, but it's not a bad card to have.
[01:10:19.810 --> 01:10:21.110]  Oh, this is a numbered card.
[01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:23.550]  This is number 53 of 99.
[01:10:23.730 --> 01:10:24.250]  Wow, 50.
[01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:24.890]  You can see it right there.
[01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:25.710]  Andrew, 53.
[01:10:27.250 --> 01:10:27.630]  Exciting.
[01:10:27.930 --> 01:10:28.730]  That's actually pretty good.
[01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:30.970]  The way you said exciting didn't sound excited.
[01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.490]  I mean, it's...
[01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:32.150]  No, I'm thrilled.
[01:10:32.370 --> 01:10:35.050]  There's only 98 others on Earth of this card.
[01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:35.990]  I can't contain my excitement.
[01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:37.910]  You guys are so much fun.
[01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:40.070]  The way he's saying that, I don't know if I believe him.
[01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:41.430]  No, it's great.
[01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:42.530]  Great card.
[01:10:42.930 --> 01:10:43.870]  That Gypsy Queen card?
[01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.770]  Worth $6.
[01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:46.490]  So, we're really...
[01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:48.710]  They're all Gypsy Queen cards.
[01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:49.610]  That was a specific.
[01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:50.630]  The Bryce Harper card.
[01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:52.070]  A half card.
[01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:53.390]  James Karinczak.
[01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:54.850]  Ooh, Vladdy Jr.
[01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:55.090]  Vladdy Jr.
[01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:56.170]  There you go.
[01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:58.550]  A little young Vlad.
[01:10:58.690 --> 01:10:58.890]  Yep.
[01:10:58.890 --> 01:11:00.110]  And then...
[01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:01.230]  Wilson Ramos.
[01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:03.210]  Let's make sure none of these look different on the back.
[01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:04.190]  They do not.
[01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.930]  We did it.
[01:11:06.810 --> 01:11:07.830]  Oh, that was the whole box.
[01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:09.290]  That was the whole box of those Queen cards.
[01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:09.670]  Oh, really?
[01:11:09.970 --> 01:11:10.210]  Wow.
[01:11:11.050 --> 01:11:11.670]  No relic?
[01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:14.810]  Or I guess maybe one of the, like, the small card was a relic?
[01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:16.730]  I guess the small card was, like, the big pull?
[01:11:17.050 --> 01:11:17.370]  The...
[01:11:17.370 --> 01:11:19.010]  I think the numbered card is the big pull.
[01:11:19.330 --> 01:11:19.650]  Oh.
[01:11:20.190 --> 01:11:20.730]  So, the...
[01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:21.410]  But what about that...
[01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:22.230]  The small card was cool.
[01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:23.270]  The small card's a big pull, too.
[01:11:23.730 --> 01:11:24.850]  I have no idea what it's worth.
[01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:26.370]  Hmm.
[01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:28.350]  I mean, how do we look up what it's worth?
[01:11:28.890 --> 01:11:29.810]  What, the small card?
[01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.310]  Yeah.
[01:11:30.570 --> 01:11:33.130]  Just go to eBay, sort...
[01:11:33.130 --> 01:11:34.030]  Wait, it's worth what?
[01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.910]  $6 Canadian.
[01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:36.690]  $6.
[01:11:36.970 --> 01:11:37.170]  Oh.
[01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:39.150]  Well, $6 Canadian.
[01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:39.550]  Canadian.
[01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.970]  Yeah.
[01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:40.610]  So, about five bucks.
[01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:41.730]  So, it's...
[01:11:42.650 --> 01:11:44.050]  $0.87 to us.
[01:11:50.190 --> 01:11:52.090]  What do we open next?
[01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:52.710]  Oh, man.
[01:11:53.090 --> 01:11:56.190]  If you guys like this, don't forget to check out the daily breaks that Geoff's been doing
[01:11:56.190 --> 01:11:56.610]  on Instagram.
[01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:57.630]  We talked about that earlier.
[01:11:57.630 --> 01:11:58.810]  Yeah, they're about four minutes long.
[01:11:58.930 --> 01:11:59.070]  Yeah.
[01:11:59.130 --> 01:11:59.910]  A little bit faster.
[01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:00.190]  Exactly.
[01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:07.490]  We're opening up some prestige football here.
[01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:08.310]  Oh, man.
[01:12:09.770 --> 01:12:10.470]  Are you opening?
[01:12:11.170 --> 01:12:11.890]  What'd you say, Andrew?
[01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:13.170]  What are you opening?
[01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:14.810]  We're opening up some prestige football here.
[01:12:15.170 --> 01:12:15.430]  Okay.
[01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:19.630]  I was gonna go for a bike ride this morning, and I didn't because my butt hurts.
[01:12:20.650 --> 01:12:21.530]  What does that mean?
[01:12:21.810 --> 01:12:22.910]  You know what that means?
[01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:24.930]  I've been riding my bike too much, and my butt hurts.
[01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:25.490]  Oh.
[01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:26.490]  You got a monkey butt situation?
[01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:27.270]  It's a sore butt.
[01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.490]  Yeah.
[01:12:27.650 --> 01:12:27.770]  Yeah.
[01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:30.070]  Deshawn Watson.
[01:12:30.370 --> 01:12:30.770]  All right.
[01:12:30.970 --> 01:12:31.450]  I bet it's from that trick.
[01:12:32.210 --> 01:12:33.170]  Oh, yeah.
[01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:34.230]  I bet it's from the trick, too.
[01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:35.230]  DeForest Buckner.
[01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:36.050]  That was so long ago.
[01:12:36.650 --> 01:12:37.250]  DeAndre Hopkins.
[01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:38.210]  I don't think the episode's coming out yet.
[01:12:39.650 --> 01:12:40.450]  Living Legends.
[01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:41.210]  Ooh.
[01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:42.890]  Teddy Bruschi.
[01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.470]  Is he good?
[01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.930]  I don't know him.
[01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:45.110]  Teddy Bruschi?
[01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:46.310]  Bruschi.
[01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:47.130]  I'm not familiar.
[01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:51.470]  Didn't he break his neck and, like, recover and then play some more?
[01:12:51.670 --> 01:12:55.450]  But then he also got popped for steroids, and now he's an ESPN commentator?
[01:12:55.450 --> 01:12:56.530]  I'm pretty sure I'm right.
[01:12:56.730 --> 01:12:59.810]  That is so much info for you to be wrong.
[01:13:00.150 --> 01:13:01.370]  That's a lot of info to be wrong.
[01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:02.430]  I just remember Teddy Bruschi.
[01:13:03.090 --> 01:13:03.970]  Shai Smith.
[01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:06.510]  Jamal Adams.
[01:13:08.370 --> 01:13:09.570]  Adam... that guy.
[01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:11.810]  And Damian Harris.
[01:13:12.150 --> 01:13:12.570]  All right.
[01:13:13.570 --> 01:13:14.570]  That's some good players.
[01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:17.090]  Not bad for a guy who broke his neck.
[01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:18.130]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's what happened.
[01:13:18.150 --> 01:13:18.950]  And then did steroids.
[01:13:19.230 --> 01:13:19.350]  Yeah.
[01:13:19.630 --> 01:13:23.210]  Well, I think he was probably doing steroids before and then did more.
[01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:25.290]  Probably for neck steroids.
[01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:26.330]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:28.370]  For rehabilitation and stuff, I would imagine.
[01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:31.290]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:13:31.290 --> 01:13:32.050]  This one's good.
[01:13:32.530 --> 01:13:33.890]  This is another one that came from the audience.
[01:13:34.150 --> 01:13:36.290]  This is the Trivia Battle Game.
[01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:39.070]  Over 1,500 questions in Series 1.
[01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:42.290]  Andrew, welcome to the part of the show where we ask you a bunch of trivia questions.
[01:13:42.490 --> 01:13:43.870]  I am so ready.
[01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:45.390]  From 1984.
[01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:46.390]  All right.
[01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:49.090]  That's nine years before you were born, probably.
[01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:50.750]  I was nine years old?
[01:13:51.130 --> 01:13:51.570]  1984.
[01:13:52.510 --> 01:13:52.970]  Oh, yeah.
[01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.610]  That was ten years.
[01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:54.390]  No, I was close.
[01:13:54.450 --> 01:13:55.010]  I just guessed.
[01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:56.190]  Yeah, you were pretty close.
[01:13:56.370 --> 01:13:56.950]  So let's see.
[01:13:57.330 --> 01:13:59.810]  I actually, I pitched an idea with these cards that Geoff wants.
[01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:00.330]  Ooh.
[01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:01.170]  Did you really?
[01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:02.470]  I did, yep.
[01:14:02.670 --> 01:14:03.410]  I don't remember that.
[01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:05.010]  These specific cards?
[01:14:05.770 --> 01:14:07.190]  Yes, these specific cards.
[01:14:07.330 --> 01:14:10.450]  Separate all the question and answer cards, making a deck of 16 cards.
[01:14:11.370 --> 01:14:11.710]  What?
[01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:13.130]  I'm not doing that.
[01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:13.470]  Separate.
[01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:14.290]  Let me ask you some questions.
[01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:15.470]  I'm not doing that.
[01:14:15.490 --> 01:14:16.070]  The whole thing.
[01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.970]  It's like, it's effort.
[01:14:17.190 --> 01:14:18.530]  You're gonna get to build a game out of this.
[01:14:18.710 --> 01:14:19.890]  I'm not doing this shit.
[01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:22.350]  All right, here we go.
[01:14:22.410 --> 01:14:23.490]  So I'm just gonna ask you guys questions.
[01:14:23.490 --> 01:14:24.110]  Okay, let's do it.
[01:14:24.370 --> 01:14:24.430]  All right.
[01:14:24.450 --> 01:14:26.250]  Who plays the husband in Bewitched?
[01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:28.270]  Will Ferrell.
[01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:29.270]  Dick Sergeant?
[01:14:29.490 --> 01:14:30.190]  Or Dick York?
[01:14:30.810 --> 01:14:31.250]  Is that right?
[01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:32.290]  It's one of the two, yeah.
[01:14:32.410 --> 01:14:33.530]  Is Dick, is it Dick York?
[01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:35.370]  It is both in different episodes.
[01:14:35.490 --> 01:14:35.910]  No, there you go.
[01:14:36.010 --> 01:14:38.350]  Yeah, there were two, there were two Darins or whatever, right?
[01:14:38.370 --> 01:14:39.070]  Yeah, the two Darins.
[01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:39.290]  Yeah.
[01:14:39.710 --> 01:14:45.490]  True or false, the first American sea novel was James Fenimore Cooper's The Pilot.
[01:14:46.170 --> 01:14:46.930]  Andrew, true or false?
[01:14:50.210 --> 01:14:50.590]  Andrew?
[01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:53.330]  It's true.
[01:14:54.210 --> 01:14:55.070]  TV film.
[01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:58.590]  Name the millionaire private eye who headquarters in Texas.
[01:14:58.810 --> 01:15:00.490]  Oh my God, I knew it.
[01:15:00.670 --> 01:15:01.150]  What?
[01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:03.250]  TV film from the 80s.
[01:15:03.490 --> 01:15:05.070]  I'll give you, you're not gonna get this.
[01:15:05.150 --> 01:15:06.010]  I'll give you a bigger hint.
[01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:13.510]  It was a private detective show in the 80s about a rich, good looking dude.
[01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:17.750]  It was kind of like the Texas version of Magnum P.I.
[01:15:18.710 --> 01:15:19.710]  Walker, Texas Ranger?
[01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:20.110]  No.
[01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:21.850]  No, because it's earlier than that.
[01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:23.330]  He was a Texas Ranger, not a pilot.
[01:15:23.730 --> 01:15:23.830]  What year?
[01:15:24.910 --> 01:15:26.610]  This would be in the 80s, mid 80s.
[01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:27.150]  80s?
[01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:28.310]  And it's in Texas.
[01:15:28.410 --> 01:15:29.030]  Matt Houston.
[01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.550]  Matt Houston.
[01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:31.170]  Never heard of it.
[01:15:31.290 --> 01:15:31.470]  Yeah.
[01:15:31.530 --> 01:15:32.310]  It's a great name.
[01:15:32.490 --> 01:15:33.770]  I watched it when I was a kid, it's a great show.
[01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:35.190]  I think I have it on DVD, actually.
[01:15:36.090 --> 01:15:36.850]  Watch it whenever you want.
[01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:39.890]  Who shot, this is a high IQ one, who shot Abraham Lincoln?
[01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:40.890]  Oh, I thought you were gonna say J.R.
[01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:46.010]  Andrew, who shot Abraham Lincoln?
[01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:53.150]  The guy, not, what was, John Wilkes Booth.
[01:15:53.250 --> 01:15:53.470]  Yeah!
[01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:55.490]  Look at who's got the high IQ.
[01:15:55.710 --> 01:15:56.230]  I like that.
[01:15:56.490 --> 01:15:58.070]  I wanna see if he had that American history up in Canada.
[01:15:58.250 --> 01:16:03.610]  Here's one that Andrew Panton, if we bet his life on it, he would be dead.
[01:16:04.050 --> 01:16:07.610]  But I'm going to bet that you will very easily get the answer to this.
[01:16:07.670 --> 01:16:07.910]  Okay.
[01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:10.230]  Well, give me a shot at this, that's fair.
[01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:11.870]  This is a music one.
[01:16:12.370 --> 01:16:15.250]  Exene Cervenka is the lead singer of what band?
[01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:19.130]  Exene Cervenka?
[01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:21.490]  Exene Cervenka is the lead singer of what band?
[01:16:23.970 --> 01:16:24.970]  Are you gonna guess, Andrew?
[01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:29.310]  I'm like going through what I know it's not. I know it's not Queen.
[01:16:29.530 --> 01:16:30.190]  It's a punk band.
[01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:31.310]  He knows it's not Queen.
[01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:32.090]  It's a punk band.
[01:16:32.090 --> 01:16:32.450]  That's good.
[01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:36.970]  LA punk band from the early 80s. Late 70s, early 80s. Very popular. Still around.
[01:16:39.530 --> 01:16:40.530]  Any guesses, Andrew?
[01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:42.050]  I'm out.
[01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:47.310]  It was a female and a male lead, both dueling lead singers in the band.
[01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:50.210]  And the male has gone on to do some acting.
[01:16:50.890 --> 01:16:56.270]  And Exene Cervenka, he was in something with...
[01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:58.950]  I can't remember now. Something with Dwight Yoakam, I think.
[01:16:59.210 --> 01:17:04.570]  And then Exene Cervenka was married to... what's his face from Lord of the Rings?
[01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:07.250]  30 Seconds to Mars.
[01:17:07.410 --> 01:17:08.750]  Strider... what is his name?
[01:17:10.150 --> 01:17:10.830]  Viggo Mortensen?
[01:17:10.850 --> 01:17:11.430]  Viggo Mortensen.
[01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:11.790]  Really?
[01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:13.150]  I didn't know that.
[01:17:13.570 --> 01:17:14.490]  Oh, that's cool. It's X.
[01:17:14.690 --> 01:17:15.030]  X.
[01:17:15.790 --> 01:17:16.710]  Is the name of the band.
[01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:20.810]  They still tour, which is like crazy because you would think that...
[01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:23.030]  Because Billy Zoom is like 120 years old.
[01:17:23.050 --> 01:17:26.730]  Yeah, you would think that with like the amount of music they had made in like the early 80s,
[01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:29.110]  it would be like, they'd just be like, ah, we're done.
[01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:31.630]  And it's like, no, they just keep plugging away.
[01:17:31.810 --> 01:17:32.870]  That's just, they love it.
[01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:33.430]  Yeah, they do.
[01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:34.610]  X is sick.
[01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:37.870]  X is sick. And John Doe looks as young today as he did then.
[01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:38.090]  Crazy.
[01:17:38.370 --> 01:17:39.750]  Crazy, that guy has not aged.
[01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:44.170]  Sports, here's a good one. True or false, the city of Pittsburgh...
[01:17:45.730 --> 01:17:48.650]  The city of Pittsburgh has never had an NBA franchise.
[01:17:50.210 --> 01:17:51.170]  Andrew, true or false?
[01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:54.290]  I'm going to say true.
[01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:56.710]  That's true, they'd never had an NBA franchise.
[01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.970]  Yeah.
[01:17:58.350 --> 01:18:04.730]  Which basketball team in the 1960s featured such stars as Bob Cousy and Casey Jones?
[01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:05.530]  Oh my God.
[01:18:06.230 --> 01:18:06.710]  What?
[01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:15.430]  Which basketball franchise in the 1960s had such stars as Bob Cousy and Casey Jones?
[01:18:16.090 --> 01:18:23.030]  Casey Jones, who went on to lead that team as a coach to NBA championship in the 80s.
[01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:23.810]  And what team was that?
[01:18:24.030 --> 01:18:24.690]  The Boston Celtics.
[01:18:24.850 --> 01:18:25.910]  Oh, there you go.
[01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:26.210]  Obviously.
[01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:26.670]  Okay.
[01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:28.130]  Obviously the Boston Celtics.
[01:18:28.690 --> 01:18:29.450]  Oh, here's one.
[01:18:29.710 --> 01:18:32.910]  High IQ, what unit of money is used in Russia?
[01:18:34.170 --> 01:18:34.690]  Andrew?
[01:18:35.770 --> 01:18:36.790]  Oh, fuck.
[01:18:37.610 --> 01:18:39.950]  Is it rubles?
[01:18:40.170 --> 01:18:40.810]  It's not rubles.
[01:18:40.990 --> 01:18:42.570]  I know it.
[01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.910]  He knows it, hang on.
[01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:44.890]  It's just rubles.
[01:18:45.090 --> 01:18:45.650]  He knows it.
[01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:46.030]  Is it rubles?
[01:18:46.570 --> 01:18:48.230]  He keeps saying the word rubles.
[01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:50.070]  I'm not sure.
[01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:51.700]  Rubles doesn't sound...
[01:18:52.650 --> 01:18:54.010]  Right, but you keep saying it.
[01:18:54.490 --> 01:18:59.010]  Yeah, well, I'm trying to create a fire here, Eric, of currency knowledge.
[01:18:59.210 --> 01:19:00.750]  And I'm just sparking with rubles.
[01:19:02.130 --> 01:19:02.590]  Rubles.
[01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:05.370]  Come on, Andrew, what's your guess?
[01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.970]  I'm gonna lock in rubles.
[01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:07.750]  He's locked in rubles.
[01:19:07.930 --> 01:19:08.930]  Alright, correct.
[01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:10.830]  It was always rubles.
[01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:12.190]  Congratulations.
[01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:15.250]  Alright, we're gonna do one or two more, because these are so current.
[01:19:15.330 --> 01:19:16.850]  And I know the audience is excited about these.
[01:19:18.030 --> 01:19:18.910]  Trivia questions, too.
[01:19:19.210 --> 01:19:20.930]  What is Supergirl's name on Earth?
[01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:22.890]  I did not know that.
[01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:24.650]  Ah, fuck.
[01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.950]  What is her name?
[01:19:28.610 --> 01:19:29.790]  I didn't know that either.
[01:19:30.490 --> 01:19:31.470]  Is Kara something?
[01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:32.490]  Linda Lee.
[01:19:32.610 --> 01:19:33.450]  What the fuck?
[01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:36.510]  Who's the father of the Hardy Boys?
[01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.830]  James Hardy.
[01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.730]  Close.
[01:19:40.090 --> 01:19:40.530]  Really?
[01:19:40.770 --> 01:19:40.950]  No.
[01:19:41.890 --> 01:19:42.810]  Fenton Hardy.
[01:19:43.730 --> 01:19:44.850]  Didn't know that either.
[01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:46.470]  Close!
[01:19:47.490 --> 01:19:50.690]  Who played Conan the Barbarian's girlfriend in the first movie?
[01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:54.430]  Oh...
[01:19:54.430 --> 01:19:55.170]  I read that wrong.
[01:19:56.290 --> 01:19:58.050]  I read the answer as John Landis.
[01:19:58.230 --> 01:20:00.290]  That's the answer to the wrong side of the card.
[01:20:00.690 --> 01:20:02.290]  John Landis? Really? American Werewolf in London?
[01:20:03.050 --> 01:20:05.310]  Oh, here you go. Who directed American Werewolf in London?
[01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.830]  John Landis.
[01:20:07.230 --> 01:20:08.450]  Not Sandal Bergman.
[01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:14.930]  Who was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic?
[01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:18.150]  Didn't say land, just said fly.
[01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.630]  Billy Earhart.
[01:20:19.710 --> 01:20:20.350]  Yeah, you got it.
[01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:24.090]  That was a good little trivia break.
[01:20:24.130 --> 01:20:24.830]  Very interesting.
[01:20:24.930 --> 01:20:25.690]  Did you guys enjoy that?
[01:20:25.870 --> 01:20:26.490]  It was something.
[01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:29.810]  I'm good with high IQ questions. I just want that noted.
[01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:31.830]  Yeah, way to go. You're a high IQ guy.
[01:20:31.930 --> 01:20:33.750]  You are a high IQ guy.
[01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:34.870]  I'm a big high IQ guy.
[01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:38.570]  One or two more weird packs, and then we got to get into your special ones.
[01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:39.510]  I pulled three.
[01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:42.370]  Next is going to be one I've been waiting to do for a while.
[01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:44.890]  Excited about this. This is Dallas.
[01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:47.590]  Wow, who shot J.R.?
[01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:49.290]  Well, don't spoil it. It might be a card.
[01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:53.370]  It's the only thing anyone knows from that show.
[01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:54.570]  Oh, God.
[01:20:55.390 --> 01:20:57.010]  Is the gum stuck again? Do we have another gum card?
[01:20:57.570 --> 01:20:59.430]  Not only is the gum stuck, it's taking J.R. with it.
[01:20:59.430 --> 01:21:00.090]  Oh, no!
[01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:10.750]  The gum card replaced whoever's face that is with J.R.'s face.
[01:21:10.850 --> 01:21:11.750]  That's a bummer.
[01:21:11.930 --> 01:21:12.830]  No, it's awesome.
[01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:16.690]  And there's no way to tell.
[01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:18.230]  No, we'll never know.
[01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:20.250]  Probably Bobby. Who gives a shit about Bobby?
[01:21:21.550 --> 01:21:23.270]  Save that. Gotta save that gum.
[01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:25.550]  All right, let's see who we have.
[01:21:26.050 --> 01:21:27.450]  Dallas, there's a...
[01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:30.090]  I don't know that I ever watched an episode.
[01:21:30.230 --> 01:21:32.910]  Dallas was for grown-ups. I was a little kid, so it was not my scene.
[01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:35.150]  Dallas, that dude.
[01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:38.510]  Action shot of that dude facing away from those dudes.
[01:21:39.050 --> 01:21:41.370]  They were looking at his back like, turn around, old man.
[01:21:42.250 --> 01:21:44.010]  Did J.R. die or was he just shot?
[01:21:44.190 --> 01:21:44.790]  He was shot.
[01:21:45.330 --> 01:21:46.210]  There you go.
[01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:48.110]  He was shot and then he... did he die?
[01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:50.370]  There's an action shot of... he did not die.
[01:21:50.610 --> 01:21:53.090]  There's an action... I think they thought he was gonna be dead, but he wasn't dead.
[01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:57.010]  Action shot of that guy hitting that button.
[01:21:57.570 --> 01:22:00.630]  Well, he's like, Sally, send in my next client.
[01:22:01.970 --> 01:22:03.010]  That's him hitting the button.
[01:22:03.130 --> 01:22:05.790]  And then that's somebody doing... working on the adding machine.
[01:22:06.970 --> 01:22:09.310]  They're counting up all this Dallas oil money.
[01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:11.610]  Oh, and there he is, Larry Hagman himself.
[01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:15.970]  J.R. looking just like...
[01:22:15.970 --> 01:22:17.010]  Talking about all the money they're making.
[01:22:17.610 --> 01:22:19.490]  Stereotypical evil white dude.
[01:22:19.610 --> 01:22:20.610]  Look at that TV haircut.
[01:22:20.770 --> 01:22:21.030]  Yeah.
[01:22:22.290 --> 01:22:23.970]  He's making deals.
[01:22:25.670 --> 01:22:26.030]  Okay.
[01:22:26.630 --> 01:22:27.410]  There you go, Larry.
[01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:30.530]  This one, actually, I had to put some money into.
[01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:42.570]  So, when I was doing some research, I discovered that Blair Witch cards are actually pretty sought after and pretty rare and have, like, some cool stuff in them.
[01:22:42.850 --> 01:22:46.530]  And so I went to buy a box and I couldn't find a box online, so I bought one pack.
[01:22:47.050 --> 01:22:47.910]  That's all I could get.
[01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:49.630]  Gracie, do you know what the Blair Witch is?
[01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.650]  I do.
[01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:51.550]  Okay, cool. Thank you.
[01:22:52.650 --> 01:22:53.370]  Just making sure.
[01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:55.930]  We're looking for a map card. I feel like that's...
[01:22:55.930 --> 01:22:56.550]  I don't know.
[01:22:56.690 --> 01:22:57.010]  Yeah.
[01:22:57.490 --> 01:22:58.970]  Why are they all stuck together, Geoff?
[01:22:58.970 --> 01:22:59.230]  It's in the river.
[01:22:59.590 --> 01:23:00.550]  I really like the movie.
[01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.950]  There we go.
[01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:02.690]  There's...
[01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:05.190]  It's fucking...
[01:23:05.190 --> 01:23:05.550]  Christ.
[01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:08.850]  What do you want me to say?
[01:23:09.530 --> 01:23:10.650]  They're not in the movie.
[01:23:11.610 --> 01:23:12.330]  It is not a scene.
[01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:13.250]  This is dumb shit.
[01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:13.410]  What is that?
[01:23:14.070 --> 01:23:15.210]  Is this from Blair Witch 2?
[01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:18.210]  That's a picture of a thing.
[01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:18.950]  That's a great question.
[01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:20.490]  There's that thing in the woods.
[01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:22.130]  This stuff looks like it's from Blair Witch.
[01:23:22.150 --> 01:23:23.170]  Oh, this is Blair Witch 1.
[01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.630]  Right here.
[01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:24.210]  There we are.
[01:23:24.210 --> 01:23:26.230]  He's about to say, I kicked it in the fucking river.
[01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:27.630]  I kicked that map in the river.
[01:23:30.150 --> 01:23:31.050]  There's that art.
[01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:32.410]  Wow, there it is, the Blair Witch.
[01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:33.310]  That's the Blair Witch.
[01:23:33.330 --> 01:23:33.990]  There it is.
[01:23:34.170 --> 01:23:34.850]  That is the Blair Witch.
[01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:36.830]  That is not the Blair Witch.
[01:23:36.850 --> 01:23:47.090]  In 1785, several children in the township of Blair, Maryland, accused an elderly woman named Ellie Kedward of luring them into their home to draw blood from them.
[01:23:47.170 --> 01:23:53.110]  Kedward was found guilty of witchcraft, banished from the village, and a particularly harsh winter, and then presumed dead.
[01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:55.950]  An early rendering of the Blair Witch.
[01:23:56.150 --> 01:23:57.490]  Wow, that's an early rendering.
[01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:58.070]  Early rendering.
[01:23:58.410 --> 01:24:00.190]  When did these cards come out?
[01:24:01.450 --> 01:24:01.910]  1999.
[01:24:03.130 --> 01:24:05.010]  Is that when the movie came out?
[01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:06.150]  I guess.
[01:24:06.290 --> 01:24:06.690]  I think so.
[01:24:07.290 --> 01:24:12.110]  The premise of the movie was that this was a VHS tape people found, right?
[01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.450]  Yeah.
[01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:13.670]  This was a real event that occurred.
[01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:21.790]  So the concept of like, we're going to take these kids that were murdered, assumingly so, and we're going to put them on trading cards, and we're going to sell them.
[01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:22.130]  Yeah.
[01:24:22.230 --> 01:24:23.990]  It's such a weird message.
[01:24:24.210 --> 01:24:24.830]  That's right.
[01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:29.110]  It's like when we put all the disappeared kids on milk cartons.
[01:24:29.770 --> 01:24:30.690]  Made them buy the milk, still.
[01:24:30.910 --> 01:24:31.370]  Yeah, it's true.
[01:24:31.930 --> 01:24:33.090]  We weren't giving up on the milk.
[01:24:33.330 --> 01:24:33.490]  No.
[01:24:34.630 --> 01:24:35.210]  Milk's expensive.
[01:24:35.930 --> 01:24:36.530]  Milk is expensive.
[01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:38.530]  We're doing the last pack of Olympics.
[01:24:38.710 --> 01:24:40.550]  Bryce Hopple, Lilly King.
[01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:42.290]  Look, she's pointing at her underarm.
[01:24:42.570 --> 01:24:43.130]  She's going, look at that.
[01:24:43.290 --> 01:24:43.850]  Look at that underarm.
[01:24:45.050 --> 01:24:45.730]  David Boudia.
[01:24:46.990 --> 01:24:47.430]  Simone Manuel.
[01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:49.010]  Do you have that one? I thought we got that one.
[01:24:49.130 --> 01:24:49.810]  I think I do, yeah.
[01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:50.410]  Because you left it.
[01:24:50.410 --> 01:24:51.430]  Because I remember the name, yeah.
[01:24:53.110 --> 01:24:54.030]  Matt Grevers.
[01:24:54.250 --> 01:24:54.450]  Okay.
[01:24:55.610 --> 01:24:56.530]  Kathleen Baker.
[01:24:59.170 --> 01:25:00.090]  And Haley...
[01:25:00.090 --> 01:25:00.730]  U.S. Softball?
[01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:03.010]  Armed and ready for Tokyo.
[01:25:03.310 --> 01:25:03.730]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[01:25:03.930 --> 01:25:04.250]  Ready for Tokyo.
[01:25:04.650 --> 01:25:07.050]  And then, new to the games, Monica Abbott.
[01:25:07.290 --> 01:25:07.750]  Softball.
[01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:08.430]  Ready for Tokyo.
[01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:09.770]  Whoa, it's a Monica Abbott rookie?
[01:25:10.230 --> 01:25:10.490]  Bro.
[01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:11.090]  Dude.
[01:25:11.770 --> 01:25:12.530]  Oh, this is a gold.
[01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.490]  Whoa!
[01:25:14.290 --> 01:25:15.090]  Oh, shit.
[01:25:15.330 --> 01:25:16.370]  Is this a different pair?
[01:25:16.490 --> 01:25:16.830]  Yeah.
[01:25:17.090 --> 01:25:17.430]  Uh-oh.
[01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:19.090]  Uh-oh.
[01:25:19.090 --> 01:25:20.390]  That's something to look for when these...
[01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:21.610]  I already put them away.
[01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:24.790]  All right, let's open up the shack.
[01:25:25.190 --> 01:25:25.970]  What are you doing, buddy?
[01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:28.090]  Shack's been drinking.
[01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:31.030]  Can't stand up straight.
[01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:31.690]  It's the Shack Attack.
[01:25:31.970 --> 01:25:32.150]  Yeah.
[01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:33.530]  Are we opening the College Prism?
[01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:34.470]  I'm a barbie chicken.
[01:25:34.810 --> 01:25:37.830]  Let's open the College Panini Prism draft picks.
[01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.870]  Yeah, let's open this.
[01:25:39.890 --> 01:25:42.050]  And then we have one other thing to open if there's time.
[01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:44.310]  Oh, we need more time?
[01:25:44.370 --> 01:25:44.730]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:45.810]  These are...
[01:25:46.190 --> 01:25:47.890]  These are important cards for us, Geoff.
[01:25:47.890 --> 01:25:48.850]  This is scouting.
[01:25:49.090 --> 01:25:50.310]  Do you want to get into it, Andrew?
[01:25:50.410 --> 01:25:51.790]  Should we talk about what we've been discussing?
[01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:53.250]  You've got to put one in the sack pack, bro.
[01:25:53.890 --> 01:25:54.250]  Yeah, I do.
[01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:57.890]  The chases in this...
[01:25:58.830 --> 01:26:01.990]  Find one megabox exclusive Red Ice Prism autograph.
[01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:02.850]  Wow.
[01:26:03.210 --> 01:26:03.510]  Fuck.
[01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:05.330]  Per box on average.
[01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:07.010]  So which one of these...
[01:26:07.010 --> 01:26:07.890]  Whichever one I put...
[01:26:09.190 --> 01:26:10.270]  That's going to be the one that has...
[01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:10.970]  That's not going to be the autograph.
[01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:12.770]  All right, it's in the pack sack.
[01:26:12.930 --> 01:26:13.590]  Pay in tribute.
[01:26:13.950 --> 01:26:15.170]  Andrew, I'll start opening these.
[01:26:15.230 --> 01:26:16.070]  Do you want to get into it?
[01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:17.230]  So, yeah.
[01:26:17.470 --> 01:26:23.630]  Geoff and I have been talking a long time about using magic to try to tilt the sports world in some way.
[01:26:23.790 --> 01:26:28.710]  Because you always hear, like an NBA player or like an athlete, boxing especially, they win.
[01:26:28.830 --> 01:26:30.730]  And they always are like, thanks to Jesus.
[01:26:31.190 --> 01:26:32.050]  They thank God.
[01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:36.290]  Nobody's ever been like, I want to thank all the spells that I casted for myself.
[01:26:36.490 --> 01:26:40.770]  They really helped me with my three point percentage shooting.
[01:26:41.050 --> 01:26:42.250]  So we had a...
[01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:43.350]  Go ahead.
[01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:47.850]  We had the initial idea is that I was going to pick the Orlando Magic.
[01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:49.910]  And he was going to pick the Washington Wizards.
[01:26:50.210 --> 01:26:52.670]  Two magic-centric teams.
[01:26:53.330 --> 01:27:01.530]  And then we were going to hire like Brujerias and like Santeria and witches and wizards.
[01:27:02.610 --> 01:27:09.430]  And we were going to have them put spells on the teams to see if we could out-spell each other.
[01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:13.370]  Not necessarily cursing other teams, but just putting spells on your team.
[01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:15.010]  No, no, we were going to curse.
[01:27:15.190 --> 01:27:18.030]  Oh, you were going to curse. Oh, OK, great.
[01:27:18.170 --> 01:27:20.830]  It was a discussion. I'm a little bit scared of the dark magic.
[01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:23.750]  I feel like we should lean only into the positive spells.
[01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:25.250]  We backed off of the dark magic.
[01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:32.370]  I don't want to get sued for some player tripping and breaking his leg and saying it was because of the voodoo doll that Andrew and I...
[01:27:32.370 --> 01:27:35.670]  You think that someone would sue you because you did magic on the Internet?
[01:27:35.670 --> 01:27:39.430]  What if I stick pins in a dude's ankle and the next day he breaks his ankle?
[01:27:39.670 --> 01:27:41.930]  Yeah, you know what? I guess what if?
[01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:46.330]  I'm just saying. Andrew and I are all about positivity.
[01:27:47.970 --> 01:27:49.950]  So are you still going to do this?
[01:27:50.130 --> 01:27:52.690]  Well, we're kind of evolving the idea.
[01:27:52.810 --> 01:28:00.550]  I do think at some point we should really have a battle of sorcery and go against these two teams and get very excited about a regular season matchup.
[01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:07.550]  We're going to bet on rookie MVPs.
[01:28:08.110 --> 01:28:09.070]  You're going to bet on what?
[01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:13.090]  Rookie MVPs for offense, possibly defense.
[01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:20.130]  And so this is like a scouting report. I kind of have somebody I'm interested in. Geoff mentioned somebody he's interested in as an underdog pick.
[01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:27.090]  So the point is to take an underdog and use the power of spells to push them into a victory position.
[01:28:27.090 --> 01:28:31.030]  The way you guys keep saying the power of spells is very compelling to me.
[01:28:31.130 --> 01:28:32.570]  Yeah, thank you. It's compelling to us.
[01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:38.850]  Now, the question is, what's considered an underdog? Because I'm obviously like, I feel like Trevor Lawrence is off the table, right?
[01:28:39.230 --> 01:28:42.910]  Yeah, absolutely. Just not. I feel like anyone who's not the betting favorite by a lot.
[01:28:42.970 --> 01:28:44.390]  All right, so can I pick Trevor Lawrence?
[01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:47.030]  Is Matt Jones off the table, probably?
[01:28:47.370 --> 01:28:52.650]  No, no, he is. He's on the table, but I just don't feel like there's any chance he would win, necessarily.
[01:28:52.850 --> 01:28:54.510]  Even with the power of spells.
[01:28:54.510 --> 01:29:02.150]  Yeah, because I'm going to pick an Alabama, University of Alabama player, whether it's Waddle or Harris or Jones.
[01:29:02.150 --> 01:29:04.270]  You can only do so much with magic, Eric.
[01:29:04.650 --> 01:29:05.570]  No, I understand.
[01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:08.390]  This is just a little to push you over the edge.
[01:29:08.490 --> 01:29:12.830]  But like, this started with basketball and now it's moved into football? Is that what we're doing here?
[01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:13.130]  Yeah.
[01:29:13.210 --> 01:29:14.650]  Yeah, it's just an MVP thing.
[01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:15.070]  Okay.
[01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:19.450]  So we're just basically going to, we're trying to pick who the Rookie of the Year is going to be, right?
[01:29:19.930 --> 01:29:20.710]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:23.190]  But we're going to influence it with positive magic.
[01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:24.250]  Yes.
[01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:24.750]  Okay.
[01:29:25.210 --> 01:29:25.530]  Positive.
[01:29:25.710 --> 01:29:30.830]  But we're going to, I'm going to figure out, I'm going to pick somebody from this box.
[01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:31.810]  Oh, you are?
[01:29:31.870 --> 01:29:33.690]  Yeah, whoever it is, they've got to be in this box.
[01:29:33.850 --> 01:29:33.910]  Okay.
[01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:37.750]  I would love it if it was an Alabama player, but if it's not...
[01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:38.370]  Oh, there we go.
[01:29:38.610 --> 01:29:39.530]  Kenyon Drake, right there.
[01:29:40.370 --> 01:29:41.550]  Although I don't think he's a rookie.
[01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:45.310]  Kenyon Drake is not a rookie.
[01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:46.430]  Yeah, so I can't pick him.
[01:29:48.730 --> 01:29:50.010]  Kyle Trask, that's a pretty card.
[01:29:50.770 --> 01:29:51.430]  Let's see.
[01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:52.970]  Oh, speaking of...
[01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:54.550]  Caleb Farley.
[01:29:55.610 --> 01:29:59.730]  He does have an ankle injury and he's expected to miss a few weeks.
[01:29:59.830 --> 01:30:02.470]  Do you think someone else has done magic before you guys have?
[01:30:02.490 --> 01:30:03.230]  Dude, it's possible.
[01:30:03.530 --> 01:30:05.150]  See, that's the thing you have to worry about.
[01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:07.570]  That's the thing you have to worry about?
[01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:07.730]  Yeah.
[01:30:08.010 --> 01:30:09.170]  That someone else has done magic?
[01:30:09.290 --> 01:30:13.530]  You don't know that there's not somebody that we're not even aware of out there in the universe
[01:30:13.530 --> 01:30:16.430]  who's counteracting our magic with their own more powerful magic.
[01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:20.330]  Do you think comment leavers would use magic to undercut you?
[01:30:20.490 --> 01:30:21.890]  I don't think comment leavers...
[01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:22.570]  I certainly hope not.
[01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:23.650]  I would certainly hope not as well.
[01:30:23.970 --> 01:30:25.330]  Eventually, but certainly not yet.
[01:30:25.550 --> 01:30:26.450]  Because we haven't...
[01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:26.730]  It's true.
[01:30:26.850 --> 01:30:27.490]  We haven't even brought this up.
[01:30:27.530 --> 01:30:28.890]  Julio Jones, ex-Alabama.
[01:30:29.210 --> 01:30:30.110]  Carson Wentz.
[01:30:30.730 --> 01:30:31.790]  Obviously, these are not rookies.
[01:30:31.850 --> 01:30:33.030]  I was going to say classic rookies right here.
[01:30:33.530 --> 01:30:33.970]  Alvin...
[01:30:33.970 --> 01:30:34.850]  Alvin Kamara.
[01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:35.390]  Kamara.
[01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:37.270]  Elijah Moore.
[01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:39.630]  Daz Newsome.
[01:30:40.530 --> 01:30:41.190]  Daz Newsome.
[01:30:41.290 --> 01:30:43.030]  What position does Daz Newsome play?
[01:30:43.930 --> 01:30:44.330]  I don't know.
[01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:45.830]  Wide receiver?
[01:30:46.670 --> 01:30:47.110]  Okay.
[01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:49.770]  I'm just curious if he's offense, defense.
[01:30:51.790 --> 01:30:53.010]  10 touchdown caches.
[01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:54.530]  Sounds like a wide receiver.
[01:30:55.610 --> 01:30:58.070]  He's a wide out and a putt returner.
[01:30:59.930 --> 01:31:00.890]  Larry Fitzgerald.
[01:31:02.130 --> 01:31:02.990]  Classic rookie.
[01:31:04.090 --> 01:31:05.190]  Mack Jones rookie.
[01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:06.310]  Alright, I'll put that over there.
[01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:10.030]  I might be swayed with that Mack Jones pull.
[01:31:10.170 --> 01:31:11.050]  Canarius Tony.
[01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:13.230]  But I heard that there was no way he was going to win.
[01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:18.110]  Someone told me not five minutes ago.
[01:31:18.150 --> 01:31:21.630]  I just pulled his red cracked ice crusade.
[01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:23.970]  Yeah, that changes everything, Eric.
[01:31:24.910 --> 01:31:27.470]  How does that change anything?
[01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:31.350]  That was a sign from the universe that Mack Jones is in consideration.
[01:31:31.570 --> 01:31:33.650]  It wasn't like a base rookie.
[01:31:33.870 --> 01:31:35.270]  Like, Daz Newsome's a base card, right?
[01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:37.750]  Mack Jones was not only a crusade...
[01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:40.510]  If this was a base rookie, Eric, I would still have the same opinion.
[01:31:40.630 --> 01:31:42.550]  If you get a parallel of a Mack Jones...
[01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:45.950]  You can't just not pretend that didn't happen.
[01:31:47.530 --> 01:31:50.770]  Yeah, no, I guess I can't pretend that didn't just happen.
[01:31:50.910 --> 01:31:51.990]  Jimmy Garoppolo.
[01:31:52.690 --> 01:31:53.810]  Alright, now here's the question.
[01:31:54.210 --> 01:31:56.670]  How do I end up with an NFL team out of this, Andrew?
[01:31:58.010 --> 01:31:59.750]  Because Mack Jones plays for the Patriots.
[01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:02.550]  You don't want to root for the Patriots.
[01:32:02.670 --> 01:32:03.570]  That's a tough one.
[01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:03.970]  Yeah.
[01:32:04.590 --> 01:32:06.630]  Well, maybe I'll get a Najee Harris or something.
[01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:08.250]  Brandon Cook.
[01:32:08.670 --> 01:32:09.330]  Chase Claypool.
[01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:10.730]  That's a pretty card.
[01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:13.010]  What do we got here?
[01:32:13.170 --> 01:32:13.990]  Kadarius Toney.
[01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.810]  That's a rookie.
[01:32:14.970 --> 01:32:15.830]  It could be Kadarius Toney.
[01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:18.190]  Or...
[01:32:20.090 --> 01:32:20.970]  Trayvon Morigg.
[01:32:21.690 --> 01:32:22.730]  Also a rookie card.
[01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:25.730]  So at the end, I'll compile all the rookies and then I'll...
[01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:28.390]  We'll figure it out based on that.
[01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:31.850]  Didn't Tebow just get cut by the Jags?
[01:32:32.250 --> 01:32:32.730]  He did.
[01:32:32.810 --> 01:32:34.110]  That's kind of... that's a bummer.
[01:32:34.190 --> 01:32:35.050]  Yeah, it's a tight end.
[01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:36.170]  Yeah, not great.
[01:32:36.190 --> 01:32:37.810]  Should have stopped doing magic spells to him, but...
[01:32:38.590 --> 01:32:39.470]  Jack Prescott.
[01:32:40.570 --> 01:32:41.370]  Jared Goff.
[01:32:41.370 --> 01:32:43.890]  These are really nice card types.
[01:32:45.930 --> 01:32:46.730]  Trace Sermon.
[01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:47.510]  That's a rookie.
[01:32:47.850 --> 01:32:48.670]  Oh, Najee Harris.
[01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:49.290]  Rookie right there.
[01:32:49.410 --> 01:32:49.610]  Boom.
[01:32:49.730 --> 01:32:50.630]  That's what you were saying.
[01:32:50.770 --> 01:32:51.510]  Christ, man.
[01:32:51.630 --> 01:32:52.270]  You were saying, man.
[01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:54.030]  That changes everything.
[01:32:54.050 --> 01:32:54.890]  That changes everything.
[01:32:54.930 --> 01:32:56.070]  That changes everything.
[01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:58.710]  Changes everything.
[01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:59.810]  Who does he play for, Andrew?
[01:32:59.810 --> 01:33:00.770]  Things are different now, guys.
[01:33:01.230 --> 01:33:02.610]  I'm not sure who he plays for.
[01:33:02.690 --> 01:33:03.570]  He's 12 to 1.
[01:33:04.270 --> 01:33:04.670]  Pittsburgh.
[01:33:05.250 --> 01:33:06.790]  I don't want to root for Pittsburgh either.
[01:33:07.530 --> 01:33:09.870]  Then I'd be fucking sucking Ray's butthole.
[01:33:10.850 --> 01:33:11.930]  Kamala Kardashian.
[01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:14.710]  Ray's butthole doesn't taste good.
[01:33:17.630 --> 01:33:19.310]  That's the problem with the NFL, man.
[01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:21.010]  No teams grab me.
[01:33:21.170 --> 01:33:21.790]  I am with you.
[01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:24.970]  And I'm so spoiled by my college team.
[01:33:25.730 --> 01:33:26.750]  Jerry Judy.
[01:33:27.710 --> 01:33:28.670]  Baker Mayfield.
[01:33:31.410 --> 01:33:32.690]  Deebo Samuel.
[01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:35.870]  Here we got...
[01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:37.450]  Eamon Ross.
[01:33:37.570 --> 01:33:38.350]  Saint Brown.
[01:33:39.310 --> 01:33:41.090]  And Elijah Mitchell rookie.
[01:33:41.670 --> 01:33:42.610]  A lot of rookies in here.
[01:33:43.410 --> 01:33:43.870]  Not too bad.
[01:33:44.570 --> 01:33:45.370]  Still got a few more packs.
[01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:47.090]  Do you want to get in on this at all?
[01:33:47.230 --> 01:33:49.230]  No, I think I'm going to stay away from the witchcraft.
[01:33:49.330 --> 01:33:50.830]  Where are you guys finding witchcraft from?
[01:33:51.190 --> 01:33:52.290]  I imagine I'll use Google.
[01:33:53.370 --> 01:33:55.430]  Yeah, we also had somebody in the community reach out.
[01:33:55.590 --> 01:33:56.130]  Oh, that's true.
[01:33:56.710 --> 01:33:57.990]  That's Reagan Point King and Drake.
[01:33:59.590 --> 01:34:00.390]  Miles Sanders.
[01:34:01.690 --> 01:34:02.490]  Nick Bolton.
[01:34:03.970 --> 01:34:04.770]  Rondell Moore.
[01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:07.450]  Hamilcar Rasheed Jr.
[01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:11.570]  I think Gavin should get in on this.
[01:34:11.710 --> 01:34:12.410]  I really have.
[01:34:13.130 --> 01:34:13.810]  I think that...
[01:34:13.810 --> 01:34:14.390]  Here's what we'll do.
[01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:17.010]  Since he can't be here.
[01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:17.330]  Yeah.
[01:34:17.650 --> 01:34:19.610]  And you have no dog and you're scared of magic.
[01:34:19.770 --> 01:34:21.310]  Well, it's not that I fear magic.
[01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:22.510]  I fear the devil himself.
[01:34:22.770 --> 01:34:24.550]  Why don't you pick for Gavin?
[01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:27.470]  You can pick and then he'll have to support that player.
[01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:29.410]  I think it might be a Mac Jones pick.
[01:34:29.530 --> 01:34:29.910]  Chase Claypool.
[01:34:31.130 --> 01:34:31.930]  Russell Wilson.
[01:34:32.850 --> 01:34:33.970]  Michael Carter rookie.
[01:34:34.050 --> 01:34:34.690]  That's nice.
[01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:36.750]  Justin Fields.
[01:34:37.670 --> 01:34:38.470]  Kyle Pitts.
[01:34:38.930 --> 01:34:40.450]  That's a nice rookie card, Kyle Pitts.
[01:34:41.370 --> 01:34:42.090]  You like Justin Fields?
[01:34:42.570 --> 01:34:43.670]  I like Justin Fields.
[01:34:43.890 --> 01:34:44.770]  That was kind of my original...
[01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:46.710]  I could see him being the MVP.
[01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:48.310]  Okay, well, we pulled his card.
[01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:49.530]  So, I mean, he's in consideration.
[01:34:52.230 --> 01:34:54.830]  Oh, I got another at the end that might be a good choice too.
[01:34:55.610 --> 01:34:56.750]  Deebo Samuel again.
[01:34:57.370 --> 01:34:59.690]  We had a fancy card of him.
[01:34:59.770 --> 01:35:00.390]  Devlin Cook.
[01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:01.690]  Oh, that's a...
[01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:02.950]  Shit.
[01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:04.750]  I gotta look out for prisms, don't I?
[01:35:04.930 --> 01:35:05.610]  That's a prism.
[01:35:06.210 --> 01:35:09.410]  So, as you can see, these are all chrome cards.
[01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:13.530]  But you can see the prism is much nicer.
[01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:15.690]  Yeah, that's fucking crazy.
[01:35:15.790 --> 01:35:19.810]  You can tell the difference by on the back right here.
[01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:21.850]  That's a base card versus prism.
[01:35:22.390 --> 01:35:23.970]  That's how you know it's a prism card.
[01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:28.210]  This one's smoked ice or whatever?
[01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:28.790]  What's this one?
[01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:30.150]  These are red cracked ice.
[01:35:30.230 --> 01:35:31.030]  Oh, red cracked ice.
[01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:33.270]  Let me just make sure there's no more prisms hidden here that I missed.
[01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:36.430]  Okay, because those are pricey.
[01:35:36.650 --> 01:35:37.590]  All right, here we go.
[01:35:37.650 --> 01:35:39.650]  Patrick Ossertian.
[01:35:40.610 --> 01:35:41.910]  And then, boom!
[01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:42.990]  Devonta Smith, rookie.
[01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:44.770]  That is another...
[01:35:44.770 --> 01:35:46.290]  What are the odds on Devonta Smith?
[01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:50.050]  Devonta Smith, let's see.
[01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:51.550]  17 to 1.
[01:35:53.770 --> 01:35:54.910]  And who's he playing for?
[01:35:55.730 --> 01:35:57.790]  I'm not sure who he's playing for.
[01:35:58.010 --> 01:35:58.530]  That's a good question.
[01:35:58.650 --> 01:35:58.930]  What's up?
[01:35:59.830 --> 01:36:01.050]  That's a good choice there.
[01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:02.710]  Might go with that one.
[01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:07.670]  What is that pack?
[01:36:08.210 --> 01:36:09.130]  He plays for Philadelphia.
[01:36:10.690 --> 01:36:11.350]  He's an eagle.
[01:36:12.250 --> 01:36:13.310]  You can get behind the eagles.
[01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.330]  Why?
[01:36:14.490 --> 01:36:15.350]  Yeah, who cares?
[01:36:15.690 --> 01:36:17.050]  I don't know. Eagles fans, though.
[01:36:18.090 --> 01:36:18.490]  Oh!
[01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:19.590]  Here we go.
[01:36:20.090 --> 01:36:20.570]  What'd you get?
[01:36:20.930 --> 01:36:21.850]  Shane Bouchel.
[01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:22.750]  I don't know who that is.
[01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:23.330]  Is that a good card?
[01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:26.010]  I've never heard of him.
[01:36:26.050 --> 01:36:27.250]  What did he get drafted as?
[01:36:29.370 --> 01:36:31.090]  A backup, backup quarterback.
[01:36:31.410 --> 01:36:35.990]  I will say he's not on the list of bettable people for offensive MVP.
[01:36:36.250 --> 01:36:37.070]  That doesn't surprise me.
[01:36:37.170 --> 01:36:37.410]  Okay.
[01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:37.970]  It's not good.
[01:36:38.610 --> 01:36:41.770]  Well, that's our auto for that one.
[01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:44.350]  Okay, last pack.
[01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:51.330]  Now, Andrew, can you pick from the full range of rookies, or do you have to pull from somebody who's been...
[01:36:51.330 --> 01:36:53.450]  It's a limited range. I can't pick anybody.
[01:36:53.650 --> 01:36:55.450]  Okay, so you gotta pull from somebody who's shown up today?
[01:36:57.470 --> 01:36:57.850]  Yes.
[01:36:57.970 --> 01:36:59.630]  Oh, I thought you meant just in general for betting.
[01:36:59.850 --> 01:37:02.030]  I think we should pick with somebody that we pulled today.
[01:37:02.190 --> 01:37:02.370]  Okay.
[01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:16.810]  Julian Edelman, Greg Russo, Rashad Bateman, and Pat Fryermuth.
[01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:19.750]  The old Fryermuth.
[01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:25.110]  Do we need to support the same person, Geoff, or are we gonna go with our own people?
[01:37:25.110 --> 01:37:28.170]  There are positives and disadvantages.
[01:37:28.170 --> 01:37:32.330]  I was under the impression that we would pick our own people and go head to head.
[01:37:32.410 --> 01:37:35.150]  I think you guys should pick your own people, because here's the thing.
[01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:47.110]  You don't have to do spells on the other person's choice, but I think the option is there should you want to commit some kind of witchcraft to your opponent's player.
[01:37:49.210 --> 01:37:55.550]  Could I do spells of, like, he decides he finds happiness in life and decides he doesn't want to play football?
[01:37:55.730 --> 01:37:56.430]  You could, yes.
[01:37:56.770 --> 01:37:57.930]  That's a very good spell.
[01:37:57.970 --> 01:38:04.070]  I would never want anyone to be hurt if he just decided I'm content with my life without football and moved on.
[01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:08.990]  I want to sell used cars. I'd rather do that than be a millionaire football player.
[01:38:09.090 --> 01:38:12.810]  Who were you saying you were interested in initially? Was it Justin Fields?
[01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:13.850]  Yes.
[01:38:14.290 --> 01:38:16.330]  Okay, Rondell Moore could be a good one, too.
[01:38:17.370 --> 01:38:19.590]  Do you know who you want to pick, Andrew?
[01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:27.090]  I would be good with... I think I might go with Justin Fields. If I'm picking right now, I would pick Justin.
[01:38:28.270 --> 01:38:33.050]  Well, I'm going to pull out my three that I'm interested in. Obviously, these are all... actually, four.
[01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:44.710]  These are all Alabama players. I'm going to go with either between... oh, gosh. I think I'm probably going to go with Nyjah Harris, I think.
[01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:45.350]  That's a good pick.
[01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:50.430]  I like him. You said he's 12-to-1, 10-to-1?
[01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:56.750]  Let me go back to that page. I believe, yeah, he's in the 12-to-1 range. He's slightly more favorited than Mac Jones.
[01:38:56.930 --> 01:39:02.990]  Okay, I'm going to go... oh, he's... yeah, I'm going to go with Nyjah Harris. Okay, what are you going to pick, Andrew?
[01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:05.230]  I'm going to go with Justin Fields.
[01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:09.020]  Gavin?
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:11.180]  I think Mac Jones has to be...
[01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:11.900]  Gavin's picking Mac Jones.
[01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:12.480]  I think so.
[01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:14.280]  Okay, it's official.
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:19.900]  It seems like a name that he would say in a fun... Mac Jones! Like, it seems like a...
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:21.640]  Mac Jones!
[01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:23.580]  Yeah, it seems like a thing for him.
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:25.280]  So, uh...
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:26.200]  Alright.
[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:28.580]  May the best promising young talent win.
[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:33.600]  And I guess we'll have updates on the regular show, like a weekly show, like a broadcast, like how this is going.
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:37.060]  And then when somebody gets hurt, I think there will be accusations of witchcraft.
[01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:41.560]  Let the positive magic begin.
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:46.100]  And I encourage the audience, pick your favorite, play along with us.
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:46.960]  And do spells.
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:48.700]  Positive spells, though.
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:50.140]  Don't hurt anyone.
[01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:51.380]  We don't want anybody to hurt.
[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:53.140]  Don't hurt anyone with pretend magic.
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:40:00.520]  Only help people with... on Fiverr and OnlyFans. I'm not really sure where you find magic.
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:02.340]  I don't think you can do magic on OnlyFans after next week.
[01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:07.440]  Me and you are finding really different magic spells on OnlyFans.
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:18.920]  Oh, I think, like, Andrew and I were talking yesterday about how, like, I was just lamenting about how I really wish I could get into NFL.
[01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:22.520]  Because I'm back into baseball, with a fit, with a vengeance. I'm into hockey.
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:24.500]  I thought you were just going to give the OnlyFans hot take.
[01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:28.140]  I'm into F1 more than anything. I'm obviously always into basketball.
[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:28.440]  Right.
[01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:35.040]  And so, football, college football. Obviously, I like Alabama, but there's only, it's the only thing missing was, was NFL.
[01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:39.220]  And so I'm endeavoring through fuckface, sorry, through...
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:41.640]  Face.
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:42.120]  Sorry.
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:42.720]  It's okay.
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:47.640]  I'm going to get into the, into football, and I'm going to challenge our audience to do it as well.
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:47.860]  Okay.
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:49.660]  Because I know they're going to say, like, I don't even like football.
[01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:51.900]  Yeah, I don't either, but that's not what this is about.
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:53.440]  It's about finding a way to make fun.
[01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:57.420]  Look at the piles of fun we had today.
[01:40:57.660 --> 01:41:01.440]  We're finding ways to take mundane shit, like football, and make it fun.
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:02.040]  We're doing something.
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:04.040]  I don't like football, but I like Red Zone.
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:05.920]  Yeah, there you go, Red Zone.
[01:41:06.220 --> 01:41:07.720]  Red Zone is just, hey, what happened?
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:09.740]  Look at all the, it's just constant. Go, go, go.
[01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:10.620]  All right.
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:12.320]  We got 15 minutes left.
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:13.280]  We have 15 minutes left.
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:15.860]  That was everything that I had initially wanted to open.
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:16.300]  However.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:18.780]  But then I went to the store, and I bought something stupid.
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:19.540]  Okay.
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:23.600]  So, I bought, because it was for sale, and it was there.
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:27.220]  If you're into cards, you know a little bit about this.
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:31.040]  If you're not, it's just going to seem like any other box, and it's going to seem really stupid when I open it.
[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:35.040]  But this is Immaculate Baseball, Panini Immaculate Baseball.
[01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:37.620]  This was about $400, this box.
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:39.000]  What the fuck?
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.140]  Are you serious?
[01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:40.940]  What is it?
[01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:43.120]  Because when you showed it to Andrew, he went, what?
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:45.940]  It was like a wow reaction, and I don't know.
[01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:47.040]  I still don't know what it is.
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:49.500]  In basketball, these are like six grand a box.
[01:41:49.620 --> 01:41:50.660]  Baseball is a little cheaper right now.
[01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:51.100]  What?
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:51.820]  Yeah.
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:52.460]  Why?
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.800]  Because it's some high-end stuff.
[01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:56.900]  Maybe basketball is like two grand.
[01:41:56.980 --> 01:41:57.460]  It just depends.
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:41:58.020]  What?
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:41:58.760]  But I'll show you.
[01:41:58.820 --> 01:41:59.700]  This is Immaculate Collection.
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:03.620]  This is one of the higher-end things you'll ever see me open on this show, probably.
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:04.860]  There's stuff higher than it.
[01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:05.440]  There's eminence.
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:06.460]  There's national treasures.
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:07.400]  What about this shack?
[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:08.780]  There's the shack.
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:10.120]  But Immaculate's up there.
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:12.480]  I'm very excited and very nervous.
[01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:14.920]  I'm ecstatic to be able to share this with you guys.
[01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:16.780]  What if you take a drink and then you spill your drink all over the cards?
[01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:17.660]  We would be in a lot of trouble.
[01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:18.020]  Okay.
[01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:20.480]  Comes in a metal tin.
[01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:22.580]  Okay.
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:22.980]  Feel that?
[01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:23.500]  It's nice.
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:24.360]  Okay, cool.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:25.680]  We pop it open.
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:26.800]  How many cards do you think are in here?
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:27.600]  Four?
[01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:27.900]  For $400.
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:28.740]  I don't know.
[01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:31.180]  That's it?
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:33.620]  This is crazy.
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:35.160]  This is insane.
[01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:40.820]  This is what I need Rooster Teeth to start paying for.
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:45.000]  This is who... I don't know what kind of budget you think this show is going to have.
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:45.520]  Yeah.
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:48.140]  Like, we don't make... I don't... This is...
[01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:48.980]  I know. I know.
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:52.220]  We need the audience to start buying the fart collections and the constipation collections.
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:54.300]  So go to store.roosterteeth.com now.
[01:42:54.620 --> 01:42:55.940]  Check out the new sauce shirt.
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:58.700]  You can pick that up so that way Geoff can keep picking these up.
[01:42:59.660 --> 01:43:01.220]  I'm just trying to entertain you.
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:02.840]  Please.
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:05.060]  So that way we figure out this budget.
[01:43:05.060 --> 01:43:06.380]  Because otherwise I'm boned.
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:07.000]  I'm...
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:09.160]  You understand.
[01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:10.160]  Alright, here we go.
[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:10.920]  Immaculate cards.
[01:43:11.220 --> 01:43:11.780]  Here we go.
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:12.840]  Let's see what we got.
[01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:14.860]  Fucking anus, dude.
[01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:15.580]  This is scary.
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:16.660]  Okay.
[01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:17.600]  Fuck these up.
[01:43:17.860 --> 01:43:18.080]  Okay.
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:18.660]  We're ready?
[01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:19.540]  Let's do it.
[01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:21.560]  I don't understand what...
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:22.960]  Are these like a bunch of...
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:23.860]  Why are they so thick?
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:24.820]  They're good cards.
[01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:25.400]  What?
[01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:29.060]  This is number 15 of 25.
[01:43:29.060 --> 01:43:29.100]  What is this?
[01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:32.440]  Mickey Moniac for Philadelphia.
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:33.800]  What?
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:35.540]  Wait, I don't...
[01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:36.320]  Why is it...
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:37.460]  This is a patch card.
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:38.800]  It's...
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:39.200]  What do you mean?
[01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:40.360]  Why are the cards so thick?
[01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:40.820]  Yeah.
[01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:43.260]  It's the most expensive stock they have.
[01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:45.860]  It's when you get premium cards, that's what they look like.
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:46.100]  Yeah.
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:47.360]  What the...
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:48.660]  Here's a nice one.
[01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:49.580]  Here's Eloy Jimenez.
[01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:52.060]  Hell of a year for the White Sox this year.
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:53.620]  Number 36 of 49.
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:54.880]  This is also a patch card.
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:55.500]  Okay.
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:56.980]  You can see his patch there.
[01:43:58.620 --> 01:43:59.680]  25 of 99.
[01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:00.780]  Rookie card.
[01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:01.880]  Davey Garcia.
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:04.320]  That is a RPA.
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:05.720]  Holy shit.
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:07.720]  That is an on-card auto.
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:10.920]  And there is dirt on that fucking...
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:12.180]  What is that behind him?
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:13.480]  I guess that's not a patch.
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:13.940]  It's just...
[01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:16.580]  That's fucking cool, dude.
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:17.220]  Huh.
[01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:18.820]  There is dirt on it.
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:19.400]  Yeah, right?
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:23.060]  Here you go.
[01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:23.540]  San Diego.
[01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:23.920]  Yeah.
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:25.100]  31 of 99.
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:26.920]  On-card RPA.
[01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:28.420]  I believe it's RPA.
[01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:30.780]  I don't know this guy, but Ryan Weathers.
[01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:31.800]  Oh, wow!
[01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:34.080]  Ryan Weathers is like our fifth starter.
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:34.880]  He's like...
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:35.600]  He's a real young guy.
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:36.440]  He's like 21.
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:36.780]  Yeah.
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:38.200]  His start...
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:42.560]  He's like one of the only Major League players to ever get his start in the postseason.
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:45.060]  Started in the postseason last year.
[01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:45.480]  That's crazy.
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:46.360]  That's awesome.
[01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:47.240]  Wow, and it's signed?
[01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:48.200]  And that's the jersey?
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:49.260]  That's fucking sick.
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:53.140]  Also, the bigger than being signed, it's signed on the card itself.
[01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:53.440]  Wow.
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:55.720]  Most signatures you'll see like this one.
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:56.060]  Yeah.
[01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:57.480]  It's a sticker that they put on.
[01:44:57.940 --> 01:44:58.260]  These are...
[01:44:58.260 --> 01:44:59.540]  This means he handled and touched the card.
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:44:59.880]  Oh, wow.
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:01.820]  And I'm going to guarantee you that...
[01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:05.120]  Well, I shouldn't guarantee anything, but this is probably a game-worn patch.
[01:45:05.220 --> 01:45:05.580]  Oh, definitely.
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:06.600]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:08.320]  A lot of times I'll just put it on and take it off.
[01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:08.880]  That's pretty cool.
[01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:12.380]  I don't know most of these players, but Dalton Varshow, rookie.
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:14.960]  That's another really nice...
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:17.360]  This is number five of 50.
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:19.020]  It's a clutch card.
[01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:20.700]  Arizona.
[01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:26.100]  What's his last one?
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:26.580]  Oh, shit.
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:28.040]  Don't drop it.
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:28.720]  Is that a hat?
[01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:29.780]  Oh, is that a hat?
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:30.720]  Oh, fuck.
[01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:31.800]  Whoa.
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:32.780]  Something's happening.
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:34.620]  Look at this.
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:38.060]  Estevan Floreal, number five of six.
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:38.640]  Wow.
[01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:43.260]  And I believe what we have here is a hat patch.
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:43.600]  Oh, wow.
[01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:44.300]  I think that's the top of it.
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:45.900]  That's off of his baseball cap.
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:46.700]  So that's probably a game...
[01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:46.860]  It is.
[01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:47.540]  It's one of these things.
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:48.940]  Yeah, it's a game-worn hat.
[01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:49.480]  Little thing.
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:51.000]  So...
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:51.340]  Wow.
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:52.440]  That's gross.
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:53.760]  Wow.
[01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:54.860]  No!
[01:45:55.180 --> 01:45:55.580]  Smells like sweat.
[01:45:57.620 --> 01:45:58.700]  Oh, my God.
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:45:59.440]  Wow, that's really cool.
[01:45:59.580 --> 01:45:59.980]  Yeah.
[01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:01.660]  Whew.
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:06.720]  So, are you rich now, or what happens?
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.820]  I have no idea how much any of these are worth.
[01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:09.160]  Oh.
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:10.600]  I'll have to look them up tonight.
[01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:15.800]  What I'm gonna do, which is what I did when Emily bought me a box of these for NBA for
[01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:18.620]  Christmas, is I'm gonna put them back in the box and never open it again.
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:19.400]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:21.420]  Yeah, they can live somewhere.
[01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:22.080]  Be scared.
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:22.340]  Yeah.
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:23.880]  Let me picture that Ryan Weathers one.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:24.180]  That's pretty cool.
[01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:24.820]  Yeah, do it, do it, do it.
[01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:25.560]  Yeah, that's pretty rad.
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:26.640]  Here, let me pull it back out.
[01:46:27.940 --> 01:46:29.480]  That's like, that's pretty tight.
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:31.300]  There you go.
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:33.120]  That's pretty cool, man.
[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:34.020]  Yeah, here you go.
[01:46:34.140 --> 01:46:34.500]  I dig it.
[01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:39.020]  Oh, those are, that was exciting.
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:40.860]  Those Dalton versions.
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:49.160]  So, when you see, like, when you see those stories on, like, CNN about a card that's
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:53.620]  sold for, like, $3.5 million and it's, like, a Mike Trout rookie, it's, like, the one-of-one
[01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:54.460]  version of these.
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:54.660]  Huh.
[01:46:54.660 --> 01:46:57.820]  Or National Treasures or whatever, but yeah.
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:46:58.420]  The movie?
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:02.800]  The more expensive card set than this.
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:03.460]  Wow.
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:04.040]  Yeah.
[01:47:04.300 --> 01:47:05.180]  Well, that was awesome.
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:05.840]  That was...
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:06.400]  How are you feeling?
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:07.200]  I feel good.
[01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:07.780]  I feel excited.
[01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:08.460]  That was fun.
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:10.840]  I got a real rush.
[01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:12.720]  I don't feel like I wasted my money out of that.
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:13.400]  Maybe I did.
[01:47:14.140 --> 01:47:14.660]  But, uh...
[01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:16.340]  I wish I could...
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:17.180]  They were great cards.
[01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:17.940]  I wish I could open...
[01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:19.280]  They're just...
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:20.200]  They're so...
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:22.460]  I don't know how much value is in them, but they're so much fun to touch.
[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:24.160]  I've never seen cards like that.
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:24.780]  And they're so nice.
[01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:26.320]  In my life, I've never seen cards like that.
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:26.920]  They're so...
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:27.520]  That was really cool.
[01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:28.040]  They were really cool.
[01:47:28.300 --> 01:47:30.260]  I wish I could open more of these, but like I said, they're expensive.
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:30.620]  I thought...
[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:32.240]  Honestly, I thought they were gonna suck.
[01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:34.880]  I thought you bought something, and I thought you were gonna open it, and I thought it was
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:35.620]  gonna fucking suck.
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:39.440]  I thought you were like, this is $400, and it looked just like that shit.
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:41.680]  I thought it was just gonna be the exact same shit.
[01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:42.940]  I really...
[01:47:42.940 --> 01:47:44.300]  I'm like, Geoff, what are you doing?
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:45.260]  Those were tight.
[01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:50.560]  Like, I'm really impressed by the look and what was on the cards and all that stuff.
[01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:51.380]  That was very cool.
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:51.880]  Thanks, man.
[01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:53.980]  And I'm not a card guy at all.
[01:47:54.740 --> 01:47:55.360]  Very cool.
[01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:59.120]  I'd love to be able to bring you guys more rare stuff like that, but, you know, we'll
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:47:59.600]  have to see.
[01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:02.620]  We'll just sell a bunch of this stuff, and then you can buy more of the new stuff.
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:06.380]  Yeah, or fucking Tops or Panini or...
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:09.300]  I see them send shit to people all the time.
[01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:10.980]  Oh, you can send us stuff if you want.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.420]  If you want to send us stuff, Tops or Panini or whatever.
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:18.820]  1901 East 51st Street, Austin, Texas, 78723.
[01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:20.840]  Care of Fuckface.
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:23.960]  And that is how you can send us whatever you want to send.
[01:48:24.340 --> 01:48:26.260]  But please make it good and not bad.
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:27.940]  I'm sick of getting bad stuff.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.100]  Yeah, we're happy to take your national treasures or your... ooh.
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:32.680]  Panini.
[01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:33.620]  Panini.
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.220]  What better way to advertise eminence than send us...
[01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:38.280]  Whoa.
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:40.460]  Send us M&Ms.
[01:48:40.900 --> 01:48:41.420]  Eminence.
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:41.660]  Oh.
[01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:42.940]  Why don't you look up how much a box...
[01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:46.280]  Andrew, why don't you look up how much a box of NBA eminence costs?
[01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:47.340]  Okay.
[01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:51.840]  Oh, fuck!
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:52.160]  Yeah.
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:54.760]  I think Eric just looked it up.
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:55.780]  What happened?
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:56.640]  How much does it cost?
[01:48:56.860 --> 01:49:00.640]  I'm looking at a card, a 2019 national treasures card.
[01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:01.820]  Oh, yeah.
[01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:09.240]  Logo, Zion Williamson, Auto RC BGS for $500,000?
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:10.960]  What are these?
[01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:12.280]  What is this?
[01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:16.160]  That's a Zion... BGS is the grading service that they had it graded through.
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:17.420]  It's Beckett Grading Services.
[01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:18.840]  That's, uh, yeah.
[01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:20.840]  What the fuck?
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:24.840]  Dude, if we would have pulled a one-of-one like Cronenworth or...
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:28.060]  Could we have... could we buy the company?
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:29.000]  Yeah.
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:30.320]  Yeah.
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:33.960]  We could have, uh, we could easily... you could easily get a million dollar card.
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:35.700]  What the fuck?
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:38.800]  If you bought the right box of... the right year, right box.
[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:41.680]  Panini Eminence basketball cards could set you back $50,000.
[01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:42.420]  Yeah.
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:43.880]  A box of Eminence is...
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:45.240]  Oh, my God.
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:46.700]  And once again, you're getting like...
[01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:47.280]  This is insane.
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:48.520]  You're getting like six cards or something.
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:49.720]  I think there were eight in that, but yeah.
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:51.720]  We gotta start forging these.
[01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:52.740]  I know. I know.
[01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:53.800]  What are we doing?
[01:49:54.060 --> 01:49:56.280]  Or just convincing that company to send them to us.
[01:49:56.300 --> 01:49:56.680]  Oh, yeah.
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:49:58.800]  Not the first thing, just the second, what he said.
[01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:01.880]  Uh, well, you've done it again.
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:04.260]  You've wasted a perfectly good two hours...
[01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:04.580]  Wow.
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:10.820]  ...watching us open, uh, things from, uh, from Dallas to Trivia...
[01:50:10.820 --> 01:50:11.180]  ALF.
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:15.700]  ...to Immaculate, to ALF, to Beanie Babies, to Superman himself.
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:17.200]  Uh, no zimmers.
[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:18.940]  This is the very first...
[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:19.460]  Shit.
[01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:21.360]  You're gonna open...
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:21.480]  This is the very...
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:21.580]  Yep.
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:26.900]  This is the first fuckface break shit that has not included a zimmer.
[01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:27.520]  Okay, here we go.
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:28.520]  So we're gonna go through...
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:29.040]  I'm gonna...
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:32.040]  Before I leave, I'm gonna go through these last four packs here.
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:32.860]  Better get a zim.
[01:50:33.820 --> 01:50:34.700]  And, you know what?
[01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:35.240]  We're gonna do...
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:36.280]  We're gonna do the thing that they do.
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:37.280]  Oh, we're just gonna...
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:37.600]  We're gonna...
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:38.220]  We're just gonna stack them.
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:39.020]  Open all of them?
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:39.840]  We're gonna max pack stack.
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:41.800]  All right, max pack stack.
[01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:43.560]  I kinda like this to, like, end a show on.
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:43.700]  Yeah.
[01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:45.180]  Like a crazy fuckin'...
[01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:46.680]  Like, let's just, like, rifle.
[01:50:46.980 --> 01:50:48.180]  Yeah, we're just gonna...
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:50.740]  Throw caution to the wind.
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:51.320]  I like it.
[01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:52.540]  Throw gum to the wind.
[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:53.180]  Throw gum...
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:55.520]  All right, guys, here we go.
[01:50:55.660 --> 01:50:55.860]  We're gonna...
[01:50:55.860 --> 01:50:56.860]  We're gonna rifle through this.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:57.260]  We're gonna...
[01:50:57.260 --> 01:50:58.300]  We're gonna get some ends...
[01:50:58.300 --> 01:50:59.180]  Big ends for you.
[01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:00.220]  Big ends for me.
[01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:00.940]  Here we go.
[01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:02.160]  You can flip everything.
[01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:03.400]  You usually get to it, then you flip it.
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:04.140]  But it's up to you.
[01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:05.800]  I'm just trying to save time.
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:06.560]  Okay.
[01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:08.180]  All right, here we go.
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:08.740]  Here we go.
[01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:09.300]  Here we go.
[01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:11.720]  Looking for the zim.
[01:51:11.780 --> 01:51:12.000]  The zim.
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:12.620]  Randy Johnson.
[01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:12.860]  Hey!
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:15.100]  You know why they called Randy Johnson?
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:16.260]  Interesting trivia about Randy Johnson.
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:17.240]  The big unit!
[01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:18.740]  You know why they called him the big unit?
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:19.500]  I can guess.
[01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:20.500]  He is...
[01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:21.880]  He was 6'10", I believe.
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:22.280]  Yeah.
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:23.320]  Yeah, 6'10".
[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:23.560]  Uh-huh.
[01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:24.600]  And they called him the big unit.
[01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:26.280]  Everybody assumed it was because he was 6'10".
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:29.880]  But I heard on, like, SportsCenter or some baseball show that it was because he had a
[01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:30.460]  giant cock.
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:32.580]  Yeah, I would think that that's probably the reason.
[01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:33.780]  I thought that was the assumption.
[01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:34.100]  Yeah.
[01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:35.460]  I thought you were gonna tell me it's not that.
[01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:36.160]  I thought it was because he was a big, tall dude.
[01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:37.020]  Yeah, no.
[01:51:37.060 --> 01:51:37.900]  You just assumed the other way.
[01:51:38.020 --> 01:51:38.680]  Okay, that's fine.
[01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:43.280]  Mark White, Mitch Williams, Jack McDowell, Jose Canseco.
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:43.820]  Ooh.
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:45.000]  Look at the roids on that dude.
[01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:45.460]  No kidding.
[01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:52.540]  Uh, Tom Herr, Steve Balboni, Darius Jackson, Dennis Eckersley.
[01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:53.800]  Hey, Eckersley!
[01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:54.720]  All right.
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:55.380]  Fantastic.
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:55.680]  Yep.
[01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:56.080]  Closer.
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:56.500]  Yep.
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:52:07.520]  Uh, Jose Uribe, Tom Candiotti, uh, Joe Carter, Daryl Boston, uh, Joe McGrain, Mike Stanton,
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:19.600]  uh, Neil Heaton, Carmelo Martinez, Junior Novar, uh, Tony Faucis, John McNamara, uh, Andy Van Syke.
[01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:20.280]  I remember him.
[01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:21.380]  Sweepstakes.
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:29.480]  Jesse Barfield, Teddy Higuera, Bobby Thigpen, Dave Hollins, Greg Harris.
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:31.540]  I loved the Red Sox logo back then.
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:33.520]  It looked like it was, like, at a carnival.
[01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:33.900]  Yeah.
[01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:36.760]  Like, you'd expect clowns to be handing out shit.
[01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:38.960]  They just don't have Red Sox in that font anymore.
[01:52:39.060 --> 01:52:39.260]  I know.
[01:52:39.380 --> 01:52:39.820]  It's a shame.
[01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:43.040]  Uh, Tom Edness, Dave Stewart.
[01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:48.820]  Another great pitcher for the, uh, for the almost awesome...
[01:52:48.820 --> 01:52:49.660]  Oh, that's a cool card.
[01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:50.960]  Gerard Perry's just hanging out.
[01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:51.360]  Take it out.
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:51.920]  Yeah.
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:52.800]  I like that one.
[01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:53.640]  David Shandler.
[01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:59.520]  Oh, we should do a set of guys squinting in the sun.
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:01.500]  Gary Green, Gary Larkin.
[01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:02.120]  Gary Larkin.
[01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:02.480]  All right.
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:05.760]  William Bragg, Tommy Gregg, Doug Drabik.
[01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:08.920]  Cory Snyder, we should do one squinting in the sun.
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:13.320]  Kirk Gibson.
[01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:14.540]  Fuck Kirk Gibson.
[01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:14.920]  Yeah.
[01:53:15.340 --> 01:53:15.900]  Fuck Gibson.
[01:53:16.100 --> 01:53:16.680]  Fuck Gibson.
[01:53:17.180 --> 01:53:19.360]  Fuck that fucking walk-off home run.
[01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:22.440]  You being such a Dodgers fan all of a sudden, I don't know how you can say that.
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:25.020]  Because I was an Ace fan before I was a Dodgers fan, and I fucking lived through that.
[01:53:25.780 --> 01:53:27.880]  Uh, Lou Whitaker, Lance Johnson.
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:29.500]  Oh, Tom Glavin.
[01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:30.400]  Great pitcher.
[01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:31.780]  Steve Finley.
[01:53:32.740 --> 01:53:33.100]  Jesus.
[01:53:34.020 --> 01:53:34.920]  Steve Finley played for, like, everyone.
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:35.820]  Ken Williams, yeah.
[01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:37.040]  Geoff, he was a journeyman.
[01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:38.320]  Geoff Robinson.
[01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:40.500]  Dave Gallagher.
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:42.880]  Mark Lemke.
[01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:43.980]  Wrecker Breaker.
[01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:44.520]  Who is that?
[01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:47.140]  Bobby Thigpen.
[01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:48.900]  Ken Howell.
[01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:49.760]  Luis Aquino.
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:52.560]  Dave Johnson.
[01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:55.460]  Manager.
[01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:56.080]  Manager.
[01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:57.920]  That's Roger Craig.
[01:53:58.500 --> 01:53:59.300]  Glenn Wilson.
[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:00.400]  Carlo Martinez.
[01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:01.200]  Mike Scott.
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:02.360]  And Wally Backman.
[01:54:02.580 --> 01:54:03.220]  No Zimmers.
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:04.620]  No Zim!
[01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:05.940]  It's Zimless.
[01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:07.320]  I might be out of Zimventory.
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:08.480]  Whoa.
[01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:09.700]  Wow.
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:14.060]  I don't know that I have any other Zimmables right now.
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:15.200]  That might have been the end of...
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:18.240]  Yeah, we might be out of Zimventory.
[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:19.340]  We have to do something about that.
[01:54:19.420 --> 01:54:20.560]  We gotta figure that out.
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:20.960]  Yep.
[01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:21.620]  Wow.
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:25.500]  Can't be having this show without the possibility of pulling a Zimmer.
[01:54:25.660 --> 01:54:25.960]  Okay.
[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:27.500]  Whew.
[01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:29.340]  Well, we survived.
[01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:33.360]  I already ripped off Car Talk for doing the wasted another hour or two hours of your life.
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:38.880]  I gotta pack all this shit up and drive home and rush our traffic.
[01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:39.760]  So that's gonna be awesome.
[01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:41.040]  For me.
[01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:42.880]  That's my favorite part.
[01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:44.440]  You gotta go.
[01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:44.680]  Oh.
[01:54:45.300 --> 01:54:46.220]  Don't forget to get a prescription.
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:47.440]  Thank you very much.
[01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:48.080]  Look at that.
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:50.160]  Eric's gotta pick up a prescription on his way home.
[01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:50.480]  We did it.
[01:54:50.740 --> 01:54:50.940]  Yeah.
[01:54:52.540 --> 01:54:54.200]  He's gotta get his dick meds.
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:56.160]  Who told you?
[01:54:56.160 --> 01:55:02.560]  Special thanks to Jack Petillo, as always, contributing in the only way he knows how.
[01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:05.140]  Andrew, really appreciate having you here, buddy.
[01:55:05.140 --> 01:55:05.960]  Yeah, I'm defeated against IQ.
[01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:07.360]  Yeah, yeah, no, yeah.
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:09.120]  High IQ guy, Andrew, classic.
[01:55:09.340 --> 01:55:09.500]  Yeah.
[01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:11.460]  And thanks.
[01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:12.400]  Thanks for tuning in.
[01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:15.300]  And as always, fuck everybody who wasn't here.
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:16.400]  Gavin and Jack, the worst.
[01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:16.620]  Yep.
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:20.000]  My two favorite people, Eric and the other one, Andrew.
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:20.960]  The other one.
[01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:21.220]  Yeah.
[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:22.360]  Bye-bye.
[01:55:23.140 --> 01:55:23.800]  How do I...
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:24.920]  How do I...
[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:25.640]  Clap.
