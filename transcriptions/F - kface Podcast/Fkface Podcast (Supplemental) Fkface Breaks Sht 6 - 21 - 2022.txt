[00:10.330 --> 00:16.530]  The mermaids weren't real, but what they did in the documentary, they tried to make real mermaid footage, and they tried to trick you.
[00:16.770 --> 00:18.990]  Are you doing an Anma-style intro?
[00:19.070 --> 00:19.610]  I would never.
[00:20.130 --> 00:20.990]  Good morning, Geoff.
[00:21.210 --> 00:21.690]  Good morning!
[00:22.130 --> 00:22.950]  Good morning, Eric.
[00:23.410 --> 00:27.850]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of Face Breaks Shit.
[00:27.990 --> 00:30.270]  This is the show where we break shit.
[00:30.730 --> 00:33.930]  Uh, and talk about stuff, and show off stuff.
[00:33.950 --> 00:36.110]  We did a little bit of show and tell today, Eric, I'm excited about.
[00:36.210 --> 00:36.950]  We've got some fun stuff.
[00:37.030 --> 00:37.410]  Let's do it.
[00:37.410 --> 00:41.050]  And you'll notice something special about today's episode.
[00:41.610 --> 00:42.890]  Sort of an extra special episode.
[00:44.030 --> 00:45.630]  We cut out all the hangers on.
[00:46.210 --> 00:47.270]  We got rid of Gavin.
[00:47.510 --> 00:48.590]  We got rid of Andrew.
[00:48.710 --> 00:49.330]  We got rid of Emily.
[00:50.230 --> 00:54.270]  All the, what do you call it, high maintenance, no talents?
[00:54.330 --> 00:55.430]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:55.490 --> 00:56.130]  We got rid of them.
[00:56.150 --> 00:56.810]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:57.310 --> 01:00.310]  Yeah, I was gonna say, that's pretty cool for you to say, and then go home.
[01:00.330 --> 01:00.910]  No, no, that's right.
[01:01.950 --> 01:02.770]  God damn, man.
[01:02.890 --> 01:07.770]  I, uh, I said some shit about boomers on Anima.
[01:07.970 --> 01:08.190]  Yeah.
[01:08.410 --> 01:10.030]  And I got a call from my mother.
[01:10.130 --> 01:10.790]  Did you really?
[01:10.990 --> 01:11.210]  Yeah.
[01:11.330 --> 01:12.690]  Your mom listens to podcasts?
[01:12.750 --> 01:13.590]  I didn't realize it.
[01:13.670 --> 01:14.710]  Oh, wow, that's pretty exciting.
[01:14.830 --> 01:15.050]  Yeah.
[01:15.410 --> 01:15.770]  Wow.
[01:16.350 --> 01:17.070]  And what did she say?
[01:17.130 --> 01:19.230]  She just sort of like talked down to you about...
[01:19.230 --> 01:21.490]  It was, uh, I got a, I got a drubbing.
[01:21.750 --> 01:22.050]  Yeah.
[01:22.230 --> 01:22.870]  Well, what are you gonna do?
[01:22.990 --> 01:23.470]  She's my mom.
[01:23.530 --> 01:24.150]  It's your mom.
[01:24.970 --> 01:25.970]  Hey, great shirt you have.
[01:26.090 --> 01:27.190]  You're never too old to be taught.
[01:27.270 --> 01:28.250]  Hey, I'm doing another thing.
[01:28.450 --> 01:29.250]  Hey, great shirt you have.
[01:30.550 --> 01:31.150]  Hey, thanks.
[01:31.190 --> 01:31.930]  This is a great shirt.
[01:32.290 --> 01:33.430]  I, uh, I like it a lot.
[01:33.530 --> 01:34.110]  I'm a shirt haver.
[01:34.270 --> 01:34.510]  Uh-huh.
[01:34.790 --> 01:35.850]  Uh, I'm a shirt haver haver.
[01:36.130 --> 01:40.030]  The trademark on the top, uh, side is...
[01:40.030 --> 01:40.330]  It can't be real.
[01:40.430 --> 01:40.750]  Fuck it.
[01:41.230 --> 01:41.510]  Right?
[01:41.850 --> 01:43.110]  There's no way we trademark shirt haver.
[01:43.110 --> 01:44.570]  I couldn't look at this any way.
[01:44.950 --> 01:45.250]  What do you do?
[01:45.350 --> 01:46.490]  I think that's how you do it, right?
[01:46.490 --> 01:47.590]  Yeah, yeah, you just throw it on there.
[01:47.690 --> 01:48.290]  Yeah, you just throw it on there.
[01:48.290 --> 01:50.390]  If you just start putting TMs on stuff, who's stopping you?
[01:50.950 --> 01:51.390]  You're fine.
[01:51.610 --> 01:53.090]  You can get this in our store today.
[01:53.410 --> 01:55.350]  You can also get this, go to the overhead camera.
[01:56.330 --> 01:57.770]  Oh, you know, we should have brought bread.
[01:57.910 --> 01:58.190]  What?
[01:58.190 --> 01:59.430]  No, we didn't need to bring bread.
[01:59.610 --> 02:01.370]  Wow, look, it's the bread clip.
[02:02.110 --> 02:02.690]  Listen to this.
[02:04.030 --> 02:06.150]  I don't think they can probably hear that, because it's...
[02:06.150 --> 02:07.110]  Your microphone's over here.
[02:08.990 --> 02:09.770]  Can you hear this, Nick?
[02:10.810 --> 02:11.130]  Okay.
[02:12.050 --> 02:12.290]  Ugh.
[02:14.190 --> 02:16.050]  I was hoping it would cover up that other thing.
[02:16.490 --> 02:16.670]  Um...
[02:16.670 --> 02:18.170]  Uh, it's, this is sturdy metal.
[02:18.310 --> 02:19.230]  We discussed this...
[02:19.230 --> 02:20.750]  Flip it, flip it over so people can see it's a magnet.
[02:20.750 --> 02:21.290]  We discussed this...
[02:21.290 --> 02:21.970]  Well, I was gonna...
[02:21.970 --> 02:23.170]  That was gonna be the big reveal.
[02:23.290 --> 02:23.570]  What?
[02:24.590 --> 02:29.090]  So now we get some facts about the fuckface break... fuckface bread clip.
[02:29.690 --> 02:33.030]  First off, it's emblemized with my birthday, June 19th.
[02:33.050 --> 02:33.450]  It's awesome.
[02:33.650 --> 02:35.810]  Not just my birthday, it's also Juneteenth.
[02:35.910 --> 02:38.630]  It's also Garfield's birthday, who I just thought is dead.
[02:39.230 --> 02:40.250]  Do you guys know Garfield died?
[02:41.130 --> 02:42.210]  Yeah, years ago.
[02:42.710 --> 02:43.550]  What are you talking about?
[02:43.630 --> 02:46.710]  There was a final Garfield comic, and it's the saddest thing ever.
[02:46.710 --> 02:48.290]  It's the one where he's in the haunted house.
[02:48.350 --> 02:51.290]  It's this spooky run-down house, and he's like, oh, John, where are you?
[02:51.330 --> 02:52.010]  I don't think he really died.
[02:52.010 --> 02:56.670]  No, no, it's the one where he's laying in his bed, and it just says zzzz, and then zzzz, and then no zzzz.
[02:57.750 --> 02:58.770]  And then the comic's over.
[02:59.510 --> 03:00.370]  It's really depressing.
[03:00.570 --> 03:01.090]  Kill Garfield?
[03:01.290 --> 03:02.750]  Yeah, they killed Garfield in the 90s, I guess.
[03:04.390 --> 03:07.470]  Which is, you know, he was born in the 70s, so that's like 20-something years long.
[03:07.550 --> 03:08.550]  It's a long time for a cat.
[03:08.670 --> 03:09.210]  It's a long time for a cat.
[03:09.270 --> 03:11.070]  You know, like, the world's oldest cat, I think, lives in Austin.
[03:11.130 --> 03:11.570]  Austin, Texas.
[03:11.590 --> 03:12.070]  Isn't that cool?
[03:12.150 --> 03:14.690]  And the previous world's oldest cat lived in Austin.
[03:14.850 --> 03:16.950]  I wonder what they're doing to cats here in Austin to make them...
[03:16.950 --> 03:21.290]  Apparently, I read an article, it's a very special diet the guy or lady has worked out.
[03:21.290 --> 03:22.370]  A special diet for a cat?
[03:22.470 --> 03:23.230]  A special cat diet.
[03:23.270 --> 03:25.490]  I don't even have a special diet for me, and I'm a human man.
[03:25.830 --> 03:25.970]  I know.
[03:26.510 --> 03:27.430]  That's it, we're right there with you.
[03:27.710 --> 03:29.750]  I would say the same, except there is a very special diet.
[03:31.270 --> 03:32.710]  It requires a lot of preparation.
[03:33.470 --> 03:37.470]  Not just Garfield's birthday, Superman's birthday, also June 19th.
[03:37.470 --> 03:38.290]  A lot of people didn't know that.
[03:38.430 --> 03:39.010]  Sounds made up.
[03:39.030 --> 03:40.710]  June 19th, 1938.
[03:41.050 --> 03:41.830]  Superman was born.
[03:42.530 --> 03:43.590]  Action Comics number one.
[03:43.770 --> 03:43.930]  Great.
[03:45.270 --> 03:48.770]  In addition, it is the color of a sort of a cornflower blue.
[03:48.850 --> 03:49.810]  You know what that signifies?
[03:50.010 --> 03:50.550]  The date.
[03:50.550 --> 03:51.130]  The day.
[03:51.350 --> 03:54.270]  The day of the week that the bread was shelled.
[03:55.290 --> 03:56.110]  Blue is a Monday.
[03:56.270 --> 03:59.510]  We're spending so much time on this fucking bread clip.
[03:59.610 --> 04:00.410]  And we're not done yet!
[04:01.390 --> 04:01.850]  Wow!
[04:02.530 --> 04:04.530]  You can see there's a little magnet on it.
[04:05.030 --> 04:07.210]  Yeah, it sticks to shit.
[04:07.270 --> 04:07.670]  Isn't that fun?
[04:08.010 --> 04:10.230]  Yeah, it sticks to that.
[04:10.650 --> 04:11.130]  Whoa!
[04:12.650 --> 04:13.730]  Look at how strong it is.
[04:14.270 --> 04:16.230]  I'm getting too lost in the book here.
[04:16.230 --> 04:16.830]  You are.
[04:17.010 --> 04:17.430]  Give me this.
[04:17.450 --> 04:18.390]  This came off my fridge.
[04:19.130 --> 04:20.870]  I could have kept going for like 45 minutes.
[04:20.950 --> 04:23.510]  We also have the temporary tattoos.
[04:24.030 --> 04:25.190]  You can grab the...
[04:25.190 --> 04:26.430]  So please don't get real tattoos anymore.
[04:27.250 --> 04:29.450]  There are so many people that have actual tattoos of this.
[04:29.790 --> 04:31.710]  Yeah, the Don Pedro and the pencil a lot.
[04:31.830 --> 04:32.270]  Yeah, there are a lot.
[04:32.370 --> 04:33.530]  The pencil is a good one, though.
[04:33.650 --> 04:35.490]  The pencil is like that style that I really like.
[04:36.630 --> 04:36.870]  Man.
[04:37.170 --> 04:38.750]  I got it so you guys don't have to.
[04:38.930 --> 04:39.190]  Right.
[04:39.210 --> 04:40.170]  You guys just get the temporary tattoos.
[04:40.470 --> 04:41.350]  There's also uniform.
[04:41.550 --> 04:42.470]  Nobody has that, so...
[04:42.470 --> 04:43.710]  I'm definitely not getting that one.
[04:43.730 --> 04:43.850]  No.
[04:44.170 --> 04:44.670]  So there you go.
[04:44.730 --> 04:47.790]  Oh, this Vancouver Child Kicker one's fucking cool.
[04:47.790 --> 04:49.370]  Maybe we can even test something else.
[04:49.530 --> 04:49.750]  Oh, yeah.
[04:50.330 --> 04:50.730]  Interesting.
[04:51.150 --> 04:51.390]  Interesting.
[04:51.890 --> 04:52.550]  Some shirts.
[04:52.650 --> 04:53.490]  Shirt Haver shirt.
[04:54.930 --> 04:55.850]  Thrice to meet you.
[04:56.290 --> 04:56.890]  That's a cool one.
[04:56.950 --> 04:57.430]  That's a good one.
[04:57.590 --> 05:03.670]  They said that it was too cost prohibitive to make an actual sellable Thrice to Meet You,
[05:03.750 --> 05:06.370]  so they said the best thing we could do is a line drawing on a shirt.
[05:06.790 --> 05:10.610]  This is the Money Laundromat shirt that comes in blue but also comes in white.
[05:12.310 --> 05:13.110]  Money Laundromat.
[05:13.230 --> 05:13.950]  It's in the name.
[05:15.530 --> 05:20.710]  Also, that was a commission by a community member whose name is mentioned on the Instagram post.
[05:20.810 --> 05:21.250]  Oh, that's fun.
[05:21.510 --> 05:23.750]  So go check out these things in the store right now.
[05:23.870 --> 05:24.810]  Get them or don't get them.
[05:24.930 --> 05:25.050]  Yeah.
[05:25.430 --> 05:25.710]  Whatever.
[05:25.810 --> 05:26.190]  Yeah, whatever.
[05:26.330 --> 05:26.690]  We like them.
[05:26.730 --> 05:29.370]  Look, I'm telling you about them so you can go get them, but it doesn't mean you have to.
[05:29.390 --> 05:30.730]  But we're not trying to sell up your ass right now.
[05:30.730 --> 05:31.270]  No, I don't really care.
[05:31.730 --> 05:32.630]  Let's get started.
[05:32.650 --> 05:32.910]  Okay.
[05:33.870 --> 05:36.110]  Let's do some of the shit that we're here to do.
[05:36.210 --> 05:36.730]  Oh, you know what?
[05:36.790 --> 05:39.050]  We don't have...
[05:39.890 --> 05:41.070]  Sorry, Fred and Shaq are...
[05:41.070 --> 05:41.650]  Oh, that was close.
[05:43.010 --> 05:43.890]  Can't do it without Fred.
[05:46.010 --> 05:46.690]  Dude, all right.
[05:47.030 --> 05:47.350]  What?
[05:47.510 --> 05:48.290]  All right, if you're gonna...
[05:48.290 --> 05:48.490]  What?
[05:48.490 --> 05:49.270]  You might as well bring it out.
[05:49.330 --> 05:49.510]  What?
[05:51.410 --> 05:52.570]  These are on sale at RTX.
[05:53.110 --> 05:53.990]  Not just at RTX.
[05:54.150 --> 05:56.110]  They'll be on sale globally as well.
[05:56.170 --> 05:58.010]  If we have any left, they'll be on sale right away.
[05:58.270 --> 05:58.390]  Yeah.
[05:58.490 --> 06:02.590]  I don't anticipate there being any of these left.
[06:02.810 --> 06:05.530]  I just imagine, like, a sea of, like, 500 people...
[06:05.530 --> 06:05.930]  You're in a convention.
[06:05.930 --> 06:07.230]  ...within the year, like, lightsabers.
[06:07.970 --> 06:08.750]  In a convention?
[06:09.450 --> 06:10.150]  This is one.
[06:10.590 --> 06:10.810]  Yeah.
[06:11.510 --> 06:12.090]  We're gonna...
[06:12.090 --> 06:13.870]  I want a World Cup, this thing.
[06:14.590 --> 06:15.790]  Oh, you want this to be your Vuvuzela?
[06:15.790 --> 06:17.310]  I want this new Vuvuzela, yeah.
[06:18.150 --> 06:19.030]  That's pretty exciting.
[06:19.470 --> 06:22.010]  All right, we should start with the pack sack.
[06:22.130 --> 06:22.630]  Let's do it.
[06:23.450 --> 06:24.550]  It's a sack pack, but that's fine.
[06:24.770 --> 06:25.890]  If you're new to fuckface break shit...
[06:28.190 --> 06:28.510]  Oh!
[06:29.530 --> 06:31.050]  I might have been a little late on that one, dude.
[06:32.990 --> 06:34.410]  The pack sack runs the show.
[06:34.590 --> 06:38.030]  Every time we start an episode, we open up a pack from the pack sack.
[06:38.190 --> 06:39.110]  Whoa, what are these?
[06:39.130 --> 06:41.550]  And then every time we open up a box, we throw one in.
[06:41.910 --> 06:43.390]  You gotta feed it as you eat from it.
[06:43.390 --> 06:47.450]  This is 1991-1992 Skybox basketball.
[06:47.530 --> 06:47.770]  Okay.
[06:48.050 --> 06:49.850]  So, I'll put that right there.
[06:50.990 --> 06:52.390]  We are gonna pop...
[06:52.390 --> 06:53.630]  These are 84 cents, huh?
[06:53.850 --> 06:56.550]  Well, probably at the time they were purchased at Walmart.
[06:56.830 --> 06:56.990]  Oh.
[06:57.450 --> 06:58.950]  I would assume 1991 or 92.
[06:59.690 --> 07:01.870]  I think Jordan's your chase card here.
[07:02.010 --> 07:02.590]  That's about it.
[07:02.830 --> 07:03.670]  Yeah, you think we're getting one?
[07:04.450 --> 07:05.230]  Come on.
[07:05.250 --> 07:06.010]  I don't have that kind of luck.
[07:08.430 --> 07:09.130]  Clyde Drexler.
[07:09.350 --> 07:09.910]  All right!
[07:09.970 --> 07:10.750]  And a Christmas sweater.
[07:10.870 --> 07:11.930]  Okay, let's see what we got here.
[07:11.930 --> 07:13.610]  We got Isaiah Thomas.
[07:13.850 --> 07:14.250]  Oh.
[07:14.450 --> 07:15.110]  Bad boy.
[07:15.690 --> 07:16.090]  For life.
[07:16.270 --> 07:16.770]  Yeah, no kidding.
[07:17.150 --> 07:17.810]  Kevin Willis.
[07:17.870 --> 07:18.070]  Okay.
[07:19.170 --> 07:19.970]  Johnny Dawkins.
[07:21.010 --> 07:21.610]  Oh, here we go.
[07:21.910 --> 07:23.810]  The Chicago Bulls starting team.
[07:23.930 --> 07:24.150]  There we go.
[07:24.190 --> 07:25.050]  Michael Jordan right there.
[07:25.090 --> 07:25.590]  Oh, let's see.
[07:25.650 --> 07:26.030]  We got him.
[07:26.270 --> 07:26.710]  There you go.
[07:27.090 --> 07:27.630]  Not the same.
[07:27.930 --> 07:28.870]  Greg Drelling.
[07:29.170 --> 07:32.950]  Ooh, Ralph Sampson with the very, very dated background.
[07:33.070 --> 07:36.150]  The background looks like the fuckstick that...
[07:36.150 --> 07:37.930]  It looks like if you turn that card, it goes...
[07:38.510 --> 07:41.170]  It looks like it's a high-speed shot.
[07:41.170 --> 07:41.430]  Yeah.
[07:43.430 --> 07:44.070]  Joe whatever.
[07:44.570 --> 07:45.230]  Oh, there you go.
[07:45.290 --> 07:45.830]  Patrick Ewing.
[07:46.190 --> 07:46.550]  All right.
[07:46.830 --> 07:48.690]  I believe he coached in Georgetown these days, right?
[07:48.750 --> 07:51.650]  Remember when the Knicks were supposed to be like the team in the 90s and then, boy, they
[07:51.650 --> 07:51.890]  weren't?
[07:52.110 --> 07:53.890]  There was a funny story about...
[07:53.890 --> 07:54.550]  You're right, they weren't.
[07:54.750 --> 07:55.370]  There was a funny...
[07:55.370 --> 07:56.370]  And then they haven't been censored.
[07:56.590 --> 07:56.870]  No.
[07:57.430 --> 07:59.750]  There was a funny story about Patrick Ewing recently.
[08:00.050 --> 08:01.650]  He went to Madison Square Garden.
[08:01.830 --> 08:02.510]  This was in the last season.
[08:02.510 --> 08:03.110]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:03.350 --> 08:05.810]  And the security didn't recognize him and they wouldn't let him out.
[08:05.830 --> 08:06.010]  Yep.
[08:06.290 --> 08:06.950]  And he was like...
[08:06.950 --> 08:07.730]  He fucking lost.
[08:07.770 --> 08:09.010]  He was like, you know who the fuck I am?
[08:09.210 --> 08:10.870]  I built this fucking building.
[08:10.870 --> 08:11.230]  Oh, yeah.
[08:11.370 --> 08:12.930]  And they had to issue a public apology.
[08:13.110 --> 08:13.190]  Yeah.
[08:13.210 --> 08:13.850]  Otis Smith.
[08:13.970 --> 08:14.650]  Did security ask him?
[08:14.650 --> 08:15.830]  And they had to go like, we do know who you are.
[08:15.870 --> 08:17.650]  Did security say, show me a ring?
[08:17.870 --> 08:18.610]  And then they just...
[08:18.610 --> 08:18.970]  He was like, my name...
[08:18.970 --> 08:20.090]  This is my ring right there.
[08:20.190 --> 08:21.170]  It's in the fucking Raptors.
[08:21.730 --> 08:22.290]  I love Johnson.
[08:22.510 --> 08:23.270]  There's my ID.
[08:24.150 --> 08:24.790]  Eddie Johnson.
[08:25.810 --> 08:26.550]  Can't read that.
[08:26.630 --> 08:26.970]  Don't care.
[08:27.370 --> 08:29.270]  Sam Bowie and Terry Porter.
[08:29.630 --> 08:29.670]  Oof.
[08:29.670 --> 08:30.170]  So there you go.
[08:30.290 --> 08:31.130]  Pretty dog shit pack.
[08:31.130 --> 08:31.330]  Yeah.
[08:31.470 --> 08:31.690]  Yeah.
[08:31.810 --> 08:32.250]  Rough pack.
[08:32.470 --> 08:32.930]  No worries.
[08:33.070 --> 08:33.290]  Thanks.
[08:33.390 --> 08:33.830]  Got Isaiah.
[08:34.570 --> 08:35.630]  Open up another pack.
[08:35.690 --> 08:36.010]  One more?
[08:36.150 --> 08:36.890]  Maybe we'll find a Zim.
[08:37.930 --> 08:38.250]  Maybe.
[08:39.570 --> 08:40.870]  I'm looking for a Zim Padres.
[08:41.570 --> 08:41.890]  That's...
[08:41.890 --> 08:43.390]  We were talking about that before the show.
[08:43.710 --> 08:45.590]  Yeah, it would be nice to find a Zim Padres.
[08:45.690 --> 08:46.930]  I want a little Padres Zim.
[08:47.030 --> 08:47.330]  Well, fuck.
[08:47.410 --> 08:48.350]  I'm trying to...
[08:48.350 --> 08:50.130]  Are you trying to game the...
[08:50.130 --> 08:50.410]  I'm not.
[08:50.430 --> 08:50.950]  I can't do it.
[08:51.050 --> 08:51.430]  I can't do it.
[08:51.450 --> 08:51.830]  I can't game it.
[08:51.870 --> 08:53.030]  I was trying to, but you probably...
[08:53.030 --> 08:53.210]  See?
[08:54.050 --> 08:55.150]  I'm just going to get in there deep.
[08:55.610 --> 08:55.930]  Okay.
[08:56.750 --> 08:57.930]  Okay, I don't like that.
[08:58.970 --> 09:00.730]  X-Files Season 2.
[09:00.730 --> 09:01.930]  X-Files Season 2.
[09:02.050 --> 09:02.830]  Okay, here we go.
[09:02.990 --> 09:03.470]  All right, guys.
[09:03.510 --> 09:04.290]  These are cards.
[09:04.410 --> 09:05.230]  What's your chaser here?
[09:05.290 --> 09:05.990]  Mulder or Scully?
[09:06.690 --> 09:07.290]  Smoking Man?
[09:08.150 --> 09:08.470]  CSM.
[09:08.610 --> 09:09.450]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:09.450 --> 09:09.510]  CSM.
[09:09.570 --> 09:09.810]  Smoking Man.
[09:11.970 --> 09:15.890]  Everybody go ahead and reset yourselves to, like, 1991.
[09:16.270 --> 09:16.450]  Okay.
[09:16.610 --> 09:17.090]  I assume.
[09:17.270 --> 09:17.390]  Whatever.
[09:18.630 --> 09:20.210]  Refamiliarize yourself with Season 2 of X-Files.
[09:20.230 --> 09:20.410]  Okay.
[09:20.650 --> 09:21.930]  So it'll all just pop right off.
[09:22.090 --> 09:22.490]  We got it.
[09:22.590 --> 09:23.530]  Oh, why are they stuck?
[09:23.530 --> 09:24.290]  Oh, they're sticky.
[09:24.570 --> 09:25.170]  All right.
[09:25.230 --> 09:25.790]  Here we got...
[09:25.790 --> 09:27.350]  Looks like probably Chris Carter, I assume.
[09:27.450 --> 09:28.270]  I don't know if I've ever seen him.
[09:28.550 --> 09:29.150]  Not going to turn it around.
[09:29.150 --> 09:29.990]  Is that...
[09:29.990 --> 09:30.450]  Who...
[09:30.450 --> 09:30.730]  Okay.
[09:30.830 --> 09:31.870]  I thought that was a guy at a piano.
[09:31.990 --> 09:33.190]  I thought maybe that was a theme song guy.
[09:33.190 --> 09:36.750]  No, I think it's Chris Carter at a podium being like, hey, I made the X-Files.
[09:36.950 --> 09:39.210]  You should, like, bend the cards a couple of times or something.
[09:39.450 --> 09:39.830]  Yeah.
[09:40.170 --> 09:40.590]  Let's see.
[09:41.570 --> 09:41.950]  Ew.
[09:42.310 --> 09:42.930]  That's like ASMR.
[09:43.750 --> 09:44.710]  Oh, it's like that.
[09:44.750 --> 09:44.910]  Yeah.
[09:46.090 --> 09:46.390]  Ugh.
[09:46.910 --> 09:47.010]  Yeah.
[09:47.090 --> 09:48.190]  It's like the worst kind of ASMR.
[09:49.230 --> 09:49.610]  God.
[09:49.810 --> 09:50.310]  You mean ASMR?
[09:50.530 --> 09:50.730]  Yeah.
[09:51.730 --> 09:52.690]  There's three aliens.
[09:52.750 --> 09:52.770]  Oh!
[09:52.770 --> 09:53.590]  That's gotta be the chaser.
[09:53.590 --> 09:53.610]  That's legitimate.
[09:53.610 --> 09:53.930]  That's real.
[09:54.290 --> 09:55.390]  That's gotta be the chaser's aliens.
[09:55.390 --> 09:55.830]  That's a pretty good one.
[09:55.950 --> 09:56.450]  We found them.
[09:56.690 --> 09:57.310]  They exist.
[09:57.790 --> 09:58.650]  They do exist.
[09:58.910 --> 09:59.890]  No, that's...
[09:59.890 --> 10:01.070]  M&M's and Santa Claus.
[10:01.810 --> 10:03.110]  He is one.
[10:03.530 --> 10:04.050]  Oh, that's fun.
[10:04.490 --> 10:05.390]  You like...
[10:05.390 --> 10:06.690]  It's like a Stuntable Pilots album cover.
[10:06.810 --> 10:08.550]  You really like that bat right in front of you, huh?
[10:08.750 --> 10:09.530]  Yeah, it sucks.
[10:09.730 --> 10:10.210]  You just keep bumping it, bouncing around.
[10:10.670 --> 10:11.390]  Put it over there.
[10:12.530 --> 10:12.950]  Oh, he wins.
[10:13.210 --> 10:13.630]  Oh, shit.
[10:14.370 --> 10:15.030]  They predi...
[10:15.030 --> 10:15.930]  God damn it.
[10:16.790 --> 10:17.030]  Look.
[10:17.190 --> 10:18.210]  They predicted it.
[10:18.650 --> 10:19.650]  Way back in the...
[10:19.650 --> 10:19.970]  Whatever.
[10:20.350 --> 10:24.150]  After the first series came out, they predicted it.
[10:24.290 --> 10:24.610]  Yeah.
[10:24.990 --> 10:26.470]  They predicted that it would be remade.
[10:26.510 --> 10:26.950]  Oh, wow.
[10:27.070 --> 10:27.230]  Yeah.
[10:27.350 --> 10:27.850]  It's pretty exciting.
[10:27.850 --> 10:28.290]  Much later.
[10:28.510 --> 10:28.830]  Yeah, yeah.
[10:28.970 --> 10:29.870]  And then, uh...
[10:29.870 --> 10:30.870]  Oh, it's those guys.
[10:30.870 --> 10:31.230]  The Lone Gunman.
[10:31.390 --> 10:31.490]  Yeah.
[10:31.590 --> 10:32.090]  The Lone Gunman.
[10:32.130 --> 10:33.190]  God, those guys were awesome.
[10:33.230 --> 10:33.630]  They were funny.
[10:33.730 --> 10:36.070]  The older that I got, the more I really liked those characters.
[10:36.290 --> 10:36.950]  Yeah, they were good dudes.
[10:37.070 --> 10:37.190]  Yeah.
[10:37.310 --> 10:40.310]  They were just, like, weird internet guys, like, before the internet was, like...
[10:40.310 --> 10:41.390]  Yeah, you know, they'd all be...
[10:41.390 --> 10:42.550]  They'd all be QAnon now.
[10:42.630 --> 10:42.890]  Oh, yeah.
[10:42.890 --> 10:43.210]  Like, there was...
[10:43.210 --> 10:43.930]  Yeah, they're all about...
[10:43.930 --> 10:44.070]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:44.070 --> 10:44.590]  That was the...
[10:44.590 --> 10:44.830]  Yeah.
[10:45.030 --> 10:45.450]  Yeah, it's...
[10:45.450 --> 10:47.230]  90's safe version of QAnon back then.
[10:47.230 --> 10:47.670]  Uh-huh.
[10:47.910 --> 10:48.610]  Everything's a conspiracy.
[10:48.850 --> 10:49.250]  What are you thinking?
[10:49.490 --> 10:56.870]  Uh, let's do some Bowman this year baseball.
[10:56.870 --> 10:57.690]  Maybe now that basketball's over.
[10:57.690 --> 10:57.850]  Cool.
[10:57.930 --> 10:58.750]  I want to disappoint with basketball.
[10:59.030 --> 10:59.430]  Okay.
[11:00.910 --> 11:01.530]  Here we go.
[11:01.810 --> 11:02.390]  Well, shit.
[11:02.490 --> 11:03.210]  Right out the gate.
[11:03.390 --> 11:04.470]  Wander Franco rookie.
[11:04.730 --> 11:04.750]  Hey!
[11:04.930 --> 11:05.690]  That is the...
[11:05.690 --> 11:07.110]  That's probably going to be...
[11:07.110 --> 11:08.070]  You probably want to hang on to that one.
[11:08.110 --> 11:10.450]  Yeah, that is the chase card of the year.
[11:10.510 --> 11:10.810]  Yes.
[11:10.810 --> 11:10.950]  You...
[11:10.950 --> 11:12.330]  This is the big time.
[11:12.470 --> 11:14.510]  Wander Franco, uh...
[11:14.510 --> 11:15.270]  Good baseball player.
[11:15.370 --> 11:16.250]  Wander Franco, good at baseball.
[11:16.330 --> 11:16.930]  Jonathan India.
[11:17.310 --> 11:17.510]  Alright.
[11:17.670 --> 11:18.670]  Bryce Harper.
[11:18.910 --> 11:19.530]  That's, uh...
[11:19.530 --> 11:20.530]  Orlando Tatis Jr.
[11:20.710 --> 11:21.190]  That's good.
[11:21.270 --> 11:22.250]  He's been hurt all season.
[11:22.310 --> 11:22.470]  Alright.
[11:22.750 --> 11:23.670]  George Springer.
[11:23.670 --> 11:24.050]  Okay.
[11:25.050 --> 11:25.670]  Carlos Correa.
[11:25.790 --> 11:26.170]  Okay.
[11:26.910 --> 11:27.710]  Whit Merrifield.
[11:29.670 --> 11:30.430]  Uh...
[11:30.430 --> 11:31.530]  Matt Verling.
[11:32.210 --> 11:35.850]  We got ourselves Gavin Sheets, rookie of the year.
[11:36.530 --> 11:37.290]  Favorite...
[11:37.290 --> 11:37.810]  Futures?
[11:37.950 --> 11:38.770]  Set that aside.
[11:38.890 --> 11:39.650]  That's a chrome.
[11:40.710 --> 11:41.470]  Uh...
[11:41.470 --> 11:43.250]  Edgar Correa, I think.
[11:43.290 --> 11:43.770]  I can't see it.
[11:44.090 --> 11:44.910]  Eduardo Lopez.
[11:45.610 --> 11:45.670]  Uh-huh.
[11:46.230 --> 11:47.830]  Marcello Mayer.
[11:48.430 --> 11:49.330]  Kahiel Watson.
[11:49.650 --> 11:50.230]  That's a pretty card.
[11:50.950 --> 11:51.710]  Uh...
[11:51.710 --> 11:52.010]  What?
[11:53.170 --> 11:53.650]  Uh...
[11:55.690 --> 11:56.970]  Here's Warming Bernabel.
[11:57.350 --> 11:58.610]  That's a baseball name.
[11:58.730 --> 11:59.850]  Boy, that's a...
[11:59.850 --> 12:00.830]  His name is Warming?
[12:01.070 --> 12:01.430]  Warming.
[12:02.110 --> 12:02.830]  That's awesome.
[12:03.210 --> 12:05.050]  As in, like...
[12:05.050 --> 12:05.310]  Yeah.
[12:05.530 --> 12:06.110]  No, yeah, no.
[12:06.210 --> 12:07.250]  You don't have to explain what Warming...
[12:07.250 --> 12:07.950]  No, I got it, man.
[12:08.890 --> 12:09.470]  I know...
[12:09.470 --> 12:09.910]  I know...
[12:09.910 --> 12:10.890]  I know what Warming means.
[12:11.070 --> 12:12.270]  Tyler Soderstrom.
[12:12.650 --> 12:12.990]  Uh...
[12:13.490 --> 12:14.310]  Alvin Guzman.
[12:14.470 --> 12:14.890]  I'll pull that.
[12:14.930 --> 12:15.190]  Yeah, yeah.
[12:15.830 --> 12:16.190]  Uh...
[12:16.190 --> 12:16.930]  Jordan Walker.
[12:17.590 --> 12:18.790]  And then, uh...
[12:18.790 --> 12:19.270]  What are we looking at?
[12:20.950 --> 12:21.670]  Simon Muzziotti.
[12:21.890 --> 12:22.190]  Okay.
[12:22.190 --> 12:22.950]  I don't know who that is.
[12:23.110 --> 12:24.010]  You got a couple of...
[12:24.010 --> 12:25.450]  You got a couple of good ones in there.
[12:25.590 --> 12:26.910]  You got fuckin' Wander Franco in there.
[12:26.970 --> 12:27.670]  Yeah, that's, uh...
[12:27.670 --> 12:28.210]  That's not bad.
[12:28.430 --> 12:29.490]  I'm gonna move that to the middle.
[12:30.550 --> 12:31.470]  Just to keep it safe?
[12:31.550 --> 12:31.690]  Yeah.
[12:31.810 --> 12:31.970]  Good.
[12:32.290 --> 12:32.550]  Smart.
[12:32.610 --> 12:33.310]  That's how I sleeve it up.
[12:33.370 --> 12:33.790]  Yeah, decent.
[12:34.050 --> 12:35.370]  Alright, uh...
[12:35.370 --> 12:36.290]  Next, I think, uh...
[12:36.290 --> 12:37.350]  Eric, we should get a little whimsical.
[12:37.630 --> 12:38.950]  Let's open some Free Willy 2.
[12:39.210 --> 12:41.070]  Free Willy 2, the adventure home.
[12:41.290 --> 12:42.310]  Yeah, I saw these...
[12:42.310 --> 12:43.450]  Somebody mentioned them on Reddit.
[12:43.650 --> 12:43.890]  Uh-huh.
[12:44.230 --> 12:44.550]  Or...
[12:44.550 --> 12:45.230]  On social media.
[12:45.510 --> 12:46.530]  That they saw them in a store.
[12:46.650 --> 12:48.130]  And I got curious about them.
[12:48.210 --> 12:48.530]  Uh-huh.
[12:48.630 --> 12:49.250]  So I bought them.
[12:49.250 --> 12:51.330]  I don't think I've seen Free Willy 2.
[12:52.210 --> 12:52.330]  No.
[12:52.410 --> 12:54.450]  Because I'm in my, like, mid-thirties.
[12:54.930 --> 12:55.370]  So...
[12:55.370 --> 12:56.610]  I missed it.
[12:56.850 --> 12:57.290]  I saw the first one.
[12:57.310 --> 12:58.730]  There was a huge fire.
[12:59.390 --> 13:00.190]  Huge fire.
[13:00.450 --> 13:00.850]  Oh!
[13:01.030 --> 13:01.450]  Huge fire.
[13:01.450 --> 13:03.170]  Well, that's the scene where the water's on fire.
[13:03.930 --> 13:04.950]  Orcas in the wild.
[13:05.350 --> 13:06.130]  Yeah, that's...
[13:06.130 --> 13:07.850]  Those are probably the scariest animal.
[13:08.010 --> 13:08.690]  Yeah, I would not...
[13:08.690 --> 13:08.970]  I would think.
[13:09.350 --> 13:10.110]  ...wanna be friends with an orca.
[13:10.170 --> 13:10.290]  Nope.
[13:10.290 --> 13:11.190]  Here's a...
[13:11.190 --> 13:11.670]  Color that in.
[13:12.210 --> 13:15.810]  That looks like every cartoon that was on Fox in the 90s.
[13:16.190 --> 13:17.290]  That's really incredible.
[13:17.750 --> 13:18.270]  No escape?
[13:18.870 --> 13:19.230]  No escape.
[13:20.330 --> 13:21.330]  He's fucking trapped.
[13:21.410 --> 13:22.170]  That's where they die?
[13:22.250 --> 13:22.670]  Yeah, they die.
[13:22.930 --> 13:23.330]  Oh, no!
[13:23.910 --> 13:25.450]  Oh, there's a good one.
[13:25.710 --> 13:25.990]  Draw!
[13:26.450 --> 13:28.090]  He's about to shoot that fucking whale.
[13:28.610 --> 13:29.070]  Look at that.
[13:29.090 --> 13:29.930]  He's got a gun and everything.
[13:30.810 --> 13:31.590]  I like that one.
[13:32.490 --> 13:34.570]  Those whales, like, are destructive.
[13:34.730 --> 13:36.550]  Like, they're, like, monstrous.
[13:36.910 --> 13:37.370]  They just, like...
[13:37.370 --> 13:39.450]  Yeah, just run through shit.
[13:39.550 --> 13:39.770]  Yeah.
[13:39.890 --> 13:41.690]  Like a whale in a china shop, as they say.
[13:42.390 --> 13:42.630]  Tip over boats.
[13:42.630 --> 13:43.230]  Tip over boats.
[13:43.330 --> 13:43.990]  They just do whatever.
[13:44.530 --> 13:44.970]  They're whales.
[13:45.070 --> 13:45.730]  They can do anything.
[13:46.450 --> 13:47.070]  They don't give a fuck.
[13:47.170 --> 13:47.350]  No.
[13:47.350 --> 13:48.290]  Why would they give a fuck?
[13:48.370 --> 13:48.690]  They're whales.
[13:48.890 --> 13:50.030]  They're way bigger than everything else.
[13:50.230 --> 13:52.130]  Kings of the sea, they call them.
[13:52.170 --> 13:52.490]  That's right.
[13:52.710 --> 13:53.990]  You said I, and then you said they.
[13:54.790 --> 13:55.750]  This thing's heating up.
[13:55.950 --> 13:56.790]  Let's, uh...
[13:58.230 --> 13:59.050]  Get to that later.
[13:59.170 --> 13:59.490]  Okay.
[13:59.970 --> 14:01.290]  Let's open up some mail, Eric.
[14:01.390 --> 14:01.590]  Okay.
[14:01.710 --> 14:03.070]  From time to time, people send us mail.
[14:03.190 --> 14:04.310]  And when they do...
[14:04.310 --> 14:05.130]  I think this is from Sean G.
[14:05.310 --> 14:06.170]  Yeah, let me not show his...
[14:06.170 --> 14:06.370]  Okay.
[14:06.450 --> 14:06.810]  Thanks, man.
[14:07.270 --> 14:09.330]  Sean G sent us a whole box of crap.
[14:09.410 --> 14:10.370]  Let's see what crap is.
[14:10.730 --> 14:11.350]  Holy shit.
[14:11.470 --> 14:12.670]  It's so many packs.
[14:12.830 --> 14:16.690]  We're gonna have to, like, feed the pack sack, but there's also just a lot in here.
[14:16.690 --> 14:17.890]  You believe that?
[14:18.930 --> 14:19.950]  Sean just went for it.
[14:20.010 --> 14:20.610]  I feel terrible.
[14:20.750 --> 14:21.450]  We didn't give you anything.
[14:21.590 --> 14:22.270]  Yeah, here's the thing.
[14:22.490 --> 14:22.710]  You...
[14:22.710 --> 14:24.750]  You guys are welcome to send cards.
[14:25.110 --> 14:25.970]  It's totally fine.
[14:26.270 --> 14:26.630]  You can.
[14:27.010 --> 14:29.130]  Do not feel like you have to, or you're like,
[14:29.170 --> 14:30.470]  Oh, I have all these things, I should send it in.
[14:30.670 --> 14:32.070]  You can open your own cards.
[14:32.250 --> 14:33.210]  That's what cards are for.
[14:34.310 --> 14:34.670]  So...
[14:34.670 --> 14:35.210]  That's fine.
[14:35.330 --> 14:35.850]  Keep your cards.
[14:35.990 --> 14:37.610]  But if you want to send them, uh...
[14:37.610 --> 14:37.850]  That's also fine.
[14:37.850 --> 14:38.390]  Fuck face, break shit.
[14:38.570 --> 14:38.930]  Hang on.
[14:40.310 --> 14:41.250]  What the f***?
[14:41.470 --> 14:42.290]  Face, break shit.
[14:42.650 --> 14:45.790]  Uh, care of Eric Badour, 1901 East 51st Street, Austin, Texas, 7872.
[14:47.010 --> 14:50.570]  It's the way we sort them and organize them and then get them to you on the air.
[14:50.950 --> 14:51.570]  There's a lot here.
[14:52.010 --> 14:53.670]  This, uh, it's tuned to my biometrics.
[14:53.790 --> 14:54.350]  That was...
[14:54.350 --> 14:55.890]  I pressed it and nothing happened.
[14:56.970 --> 14:57.750]  Let's, uh...
[14:57.750 --> 14:59.090]  First off, let's feed the...
[14:59.090 --> 14:59.290]  Okay.
[14:59.690 --> 15:02.410]  Alright, we'll put the prism, uh, rasslin' in.
[15:02.670 --> 15:04.050]  Are you familiar with WWE?
[15:05.250 --> 15:06.030]  I am familiar.
[15:06.390 --> 15:08.250]  Alright, do you know who Roman Reigns is?
[15:08.270 --> 15:08.590]  I do.
[15:08.650 --> 15:09.170]  And Becky Lynch?
[15:09.210 --> 15:09.630]  I do.
[15:09.710 --> 15:10.270]  Are they your favorites?
[15:10.510 --> 15:12.430]  Uh, no, they're like the top people.
[15:12.890 --> 15:13.570]  They're the top people.
[15:13.610 --> 15:14.710]  Yeah, those are like the top two.
[15:15.810 --> 15:17.350]  Those are the people who draw money.
[15:17.570 --> 15:19.410]  Who's the chase card in rasslin'?
[15:19.410 --> 15:22.610]  Um, we're gonna say it's Matt Riddle.
[15:22.870 --> 15:23.410]  Matt Riddle.
[15:23.550 --> 15:23.710]  Yep.
[15:23.870 --> 15:24.210]  Hell yeah.
[15:24.390 --> 15:26.530]  He's a UFC guy and he has a big mushroom tattooed on his side.
[15:26.610 --> 15:26.990]  He's weird.
[15:28.270 --> 15:29.130]  Trent Seven.
[15:29.510 --> 15:29.790]  Oh.
[15:30.230 --> 15:30.610]  Wow.
[15:30.990 --> 15:31.250]  Alright.
[15:31.970 --> 15:32.790]  What's the deal with him?
[15:32.930 --> 15:33.910]  Oh, he's a UK guy.
[15:34.870 --> 15:37.010]  That's the least Eric's ever had to say about a wrestler.
[15:37.270 --> 15:37.310]  Yep.
[15:37.310 --> 15:37.790]  Braun Breaker.
[15:38.090 --> 15:41.130]  This guy, I don't know if you remember early 90s wrestling, the Steiner Brothers?
[15:41.310 --> 15:43.410]  This is Rick Steiner's son.
[15:43.410 --> 15:44.350]  He is...
[15:44.350 --> 15:45.090]  Oh, Rick Steiner!
[15:45.150 --> 15:46.590]  Yeah, you would think that they would just...
[15:46.590 --> 15:46.970]  With his chin strap.
[15:47.030 --> 15:47.230]  Yep.
[15:47.410 --> 15:48.010]  Yeah, yeah.
[15:48.250 --> 15:51.630]  And that's his kid and he's jacked as fuck.
[15:51.850 --> 15:52.590]  And he's insane.
[15:52.710 --> 15:53.430]  He's huge.
[15:53.610 --> 15:56.230]  Did he do Greco-Roman wrestling as well?
[15:56.290 --> 15:58.070]  He played football.
[15:58.290 --> 15:58.470]  Oh.
[15:58.470 --> 15:59.990]  And I think that he probably played...
[15:59.990 --> 16:01.290]  I think he was probably a wrestler in college.
[16:01.470 --> 16:02.530]  Okay, now he plays fightball.
[16:02.630 --> 16:03.830]  Yeah, now...
[16:04.710 --> 16:05.070]  Undertaker.
[16:06.590 --> 16:07.870]  I can tell this is...
[16:07.870 --> 16:09.890]  I feel like we have to pull that...
[16:09.890 --> 16:13.390]  I feel like this is a card that Andrew would have a lot to say about.
[16:13.390 --> 16:15.150]  Like, it's just an...
[16:15.150 --> 16:17.010]  It's like hardly even a card.
[16:17.430 --> 16:18.730]  It's just an outline.
[16:19.150 --> 16:19.830]  Oh, man.
[16:20.090 --> 16:20.470]  Boy.
[16:20.550 --> 16:20.890]  Oh, shit!
[16:21.070 --> 16:21.830]  Jinder Mahal!
[16:21.990 --> 16:22.350]  Hey!
[16:23.130 --> 16:23.330]  Cool.
[16:23.730 --> 16:24.010]  Look at this.
[16:24.010 --> 16:27.330]  Former WWE champion, Jinder Mahal.
[16:27.710 --> 16:28.090]  Former...
[16:28.090 --> 16:29.330]  How long was he champion for?
[16:29.330 --> 16:30.750]  Probably about four months.
[16:31.010 --> 16:31.250]  Really?
[16:31.410 --> 16:31.650]  Yeah.
[16:31.870 --> 16:32.770]  Didn't defend it for very long?
[16:33.210 --> 16:35.510]  No, and has not been at the top of the card since.
[16:35.570 --> 16:36.490]  Ooh, I wonder why.
[16:36.590 --> 16:37.390]  Low card guy...
[16:37.950 --> 16:38.410]  That's okay.
[16:38.630 --> 16:39.250]  That's what they say?
[16:39.290 --> 16:39.750]  Low card guy?
[16:39.930 --> 16:41.090]  Eh, like, you know...
[16:41.090 --> 16:41.850]  Yeah, exactly.
[16:41.850 --> 16:42.750]  Low on the card.
[16:42.830 --> 16:43.530]  Okay, I'll trust you.
[16:43.690 --> 16:46.870]  Here we're gonna open up a pack of Panini 2122 Donruss.
[16:46.930 --> 16:48.650]  I've opened up so much of this at home.
[16:48.830 --> 16:50.410]  Panini cards good cards, or...?
[16:50.810 --> 16:51.870]  Pretty much everything's Panini.
[16:53.150 --> 16:54.630]  But yeah, Panini are tops.
[16:56.590 --> 16:57.250]  What do we got?
[16:57.330 --> 16:57.710]  Panini's good.
[16:57.810 --> 17:00.970]  This is, like, low end, but it's one up from Hoops.
[17:01.550 --> 17:02.750]  Hoops is, like, the doo-doo-est.
[17:03.150 --> 17:04.150]  And then you get to...
[17:04.150 --> 17:05.670]  Then Donruss is, like, bog standard.
[17:06.350 --> 17:08.030]  Anthony Edwards, second year card.
[17:08.090 --> 17:08.230]  Yeah.
[17:08.430 --> 17:09.170]  Fantastic player.
[17:09.890 --> 17:11.170]  Future of the NBA right there.
[17:11.170 --> 17:12.410]  Buddy Heald.
[17:13.030 --> 17:14.050]  People used to say that about him.
[17:14.310 --> 17:15.010]  Zion Williamson.
[17:15.110 --> 17:15.870]  People used to say that about him.
[17:18.470 --> 17:19.650]  PJ Washington Jr.
[17:20.310 --> 17:21.190]  Jay Crowder.
[17:21.390 --> 17:23.750]  I have a feeling he might be going somewhere in this offseason.
[17:24.110 --> 17:27.570]  Trey Young, now the official villain of the NBA.
[17:27.770 --> 17:28.250]  Oh, yeah?
[17:28.270 --> 17:30.310]  He's accepted and loves the role.
[17:30.810 --> 17:31.710]  Gary Trent Jr.
[17:32.390 --> 17:32.890]  He's a junior.
[17:33.610 --> 17:34.390]  Oh, his dad's Gary Trent.
[17:34.630 --> 17:35.690]  Yeah, his dad's Gary Trent.
[17:36.150 --> 17:36.670]  Here we go.
[17:36.730 --> 17:37.930]  Lamello ball complete.
[17:38.470 --> 17:39.170]  That's probably a good...
[17:39.170 --> 17:39.770]  Wow!
[17:39.770 --> 17:42.270]  The whole Lamello ball in the one card?
[17:42.490 --> 17:43.450]  Can I say something about Lamello ball?
[17:43.530 --> 17:43.710]  Yeah.
[17:43.850 --> 17:44.690]  Oh, please.
[17:44.910 --> 17:45.790]  He's funny on TV.
[17:45.890 --> 17:46.710]  He is funny on TV.
[17:46.710 --> 17:48.250]  His TV commercials are very good.
[17:48.250 --> 17:52.570]  I think that he is great as a personality.
[17:52.830 --> 17:53.010]  Yeah.
[17:53.790 --> 17:54.230]  And...
[17:54.230 --> 17:54.990]  I'm Lily Nash.
[17:55.370 --> 17:55.810]  So funny.
[17:55.810 --> 17:57.570]  I think he found his niche.
[17:57.670 --> 17:57.990]  Same time.
[17:58.730 --> 17:59.410]  He's not a fool.
[17:59.530 --> 17:59.690]  Yeah.
[18:00.130 --> 18:03.510]  This is sad because Mike's not here, Nick's running the soundboard,
[18:03.650 --> 18:06.370]  and usually what happens is we start opening these cards,
[18:06.370 --> 18:09.990]  and when there's a former UT player just from in the shadows,
[18:10.210 --> 18:12.970]  you see Mike's hand go up because he holds up the horns.
[18:14.650 --> 18:17.310]  We don't have Andrew, so you and I are going to...
[18:17.310 --> 18:19.210]  We're going to suffer through some hockey together.
[18:19.930 --> 18:21.570]  Oh! Oh!
[18:22.670 --> 18:24.310]  Never mind. We have Andrew.
[18:25.330 --> 18:27.430]  That Andrew contributes about as much. That's interesting.
[18:27.730 --> 18:28.390]  What is cheating?
[18:30.610 --> 18:32.230]  There's so many cards!
[18:32.250 --> 18:33.390]  Oh, yeah, they're all going to be hard.
[18:33.390 --> 18:35.370]  Why would you open this pack?
[18:35.370 --> 18:37.410]  We don't know anything about this sport.
[18:37.710 --> 18:39.250]  Jamie Oleksiak, he does.
[18:40.010 --> 18:42.470]  Nick Paul, he's a...
[18:42.470 --> 18:42.890]  Go ahead.
[18:43.530 --> 18:45.090]  Not related to the Thunderbolts.
[18:46.090 --> 18:47.890]  Dimitri Orlov, I've heard that name.
[18:48.370 --> 18:49.990]  Linus Ulmark.
[18:51.410 --> 18:52.770]  Anthony Dulcolax.
[18:54.790 --> 18:55.690]  Close enough.
[18:55.870 --> 18:56.130]  Boy.
[18:56.650 --> 18:57.390]  Ryan Miller.
[18:57.530 --> 18:58.790]  There are so many cards, Geoff.
[18:59.230 --> 19:00.630]  Casey Middlestat.
[19:00.710 --> 19:01.270]  This sucks.
[19:02.010 --> 19:03.670]  Kyle Oaksy-Pokesy.
[19:05.110 --> 19:05.950]  Sam Gagner.
[19:06.150 --> 19:09.450]  Oh, shit! Sam Gagner! We've done him before. We like them.
[19:09.590 --> 19:11.970]  We had Gagner, Gagner, and Gagney. They were a law firm. Remember?
[19:13.070 --> 19:13.490]  No.
[19:13.750 --> 19:14.690]  I fucking remember.
[19:14.850 --> 19:15.670]  Is that the rules to hockey?
[19:18.090 --> 19:19.810]  That's a bunch of names we also don't know.
[19:20.610 --> 19:21.450]  Cole Lind.
[19:21.970 --> 19:26.410]  He's a rookie, I guess, in French, so we'll save that for... who knows.
[19:27.010 --> 19:28.270]  There's whatever the fuck that is.
[19:28.650 --> 19:30.830]  Oh, shit! It's Jake Bean.
[19:32.870 --> 19:35.570]  Everybody loves... great hockey name, Jake Bean.
[19:36.890 --> 19:39.090]  Oh, shit! It's Jake Bean.
[19:39.850 --> 19:40.990]  Calvin DeHaan.
[19:41.950 --> 19:43.230]  Adam Larson.
[19:44.210 --> 19:46.030]  Jacob spelled stupid.
[19:46.990 --> 19:47.610]  Zborl.
[19:48.750 --> 19:50.350]  J-A-K-U-B.
[19:50.730 --> 19:53.690]  I don't think... I don't think maybe he's from here, man.
[19:54.330 --> 19:56.530]  Where he's from, they spell Jacob stupid.
[19:57.010 --> 19:57.810]  Kirby Detch.
[19:58.430 --> 19:59.830]  Mark Stone.
[20:02.430 --> 20:03.630]  Johnny Gu...
[20:05.170 --> 20:06.370]  Oh, Gudro.
[20:07.130 --> 20:07.890]  Nailed it.
[20:08.210 --> 20:09.650]  Dominic Kubalik.
[20:10.270 --> 20:11.650]  The Barclays Center.
[20:14.470 --> 20:17.790]  J.T. Miller, wasn't that guy on... wasn't he a comedian?
[20:18.110 --> 20:20.510]  Yeah, he was in Transformers. Not anymore.
[20:20.750 --> 20:21.270]  Yeah, not anymore.
[20:21.650 --> 20:22.890]  Philip Forsberg.
[20:23.410 --> 20:24.370]  Ian Mitchell.
[20:25.730 --> 20:26.350]  Big guy!
[20:26.950 --> 20:27.350]  Suban.
[20:27.710 --> 20:29.750]  That would be funny if you watched Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.
[20:29.990 --> 20:30.970]  That's how Dorit says her husband's name.
[20:30.970 --> 20:31.710]  I'm not gonna cheat.
[20:32.110 --> 20:32.230]  Cool.
[20:33.030 --> 20:34.330]  Uh, Patrick Moran.
[20:35.530 --> 20:36.870]  He's a real Moran, that guy.
[20:38.310 --> 20:39.190]  What a maroon!
[20:39.230 --> 20:40.450]  Did that card say maroon?
[20:40.630 --> 20:41.010]  What a maroon!
[20:41.250 --> 20:42.350]  Just making sure. Cool, man.
[20:43.530 --> 20:44.330]  Christopher Tenev.
[20:44.750 --> 20:45.150]  And...
[20:45.150 --> 20:46.490]  And fucking finally.
[20:46.570 --> 20:48.210]  And Bernie's cousin, Brent Burns.
[20:51.770 --> 20:52.630]  We're gonna save that.
[20:52.730 --> 20:53.450]  Founder of the company.
[20:54.870 --> 20:55.690]  Cousin of Burns.
[21:01.070 --> 21:03.010]  Let's continue with shit we don't know about and talk about soccer.
[21:04.290 --> 21:04.570]  Why?!
[21:04.570 --> 21:05.750]  Yeah, we got some tops.
[21:07.490 --> 21:11.790]  We're like the only two sports guys... like, this is Gavin's wheelhouse, the other one was Andrew's.
[21:11.870 --> 21:14.170]  Okay, I can do a little... I can do some soccer talk. Hold on.
[21:14.350 --> 21:17.030]  Unless any of these guys are Austin FC, I got nothing for you, bud.
[21:17.130 --> 21:18.030]  Stars aligned in Paris.
[21:18.150 --> 21:18.750]  Alright, so no.
[21:19.170 --> 21:20.490]  Here's Lucas Ocampos.
[21:21.370 --> 21:22.650]  Here's Sergio Basquiat.
[21:23.730 --> 21:24.130]  Here's...
[21:24.550 --> 21:24.950]  Koke.
[21:26.690 --> 21:27.350]  What's his name?
[21:27.470 --> 21:27.790]  Koke.
[21:28.970 --> 21:29.570]  We'll save him.
[21:31.210 --> 21:32.570]  Here's Yousef Demir.
[21:33.030 --> 21:34.630]  He used to be Cat Stevens. Changed his name to Yousef.
[21:34.630 --> 21:35.930]  No, no, no, no.
[21:35.970 --> 21:36.330]  He did!
[21:36.950 --> 21:37.670]  I know.
[21:38.050 --> 21:40.290]  No, I know. That's just not him.
[21:40.890 --> 21:41.670]  That's a parallel.
[21:41.910 --> 21:43.430]  Nope. Okay. Great.
[21:46.470 --> 21:49.630]  I read a really interesting article about how he ended up doing the soundtrack to Harold and Mud.
[21:50.230 --> 21:51.510]  And now look at him, playing soccer.
[21:52.650 --> 21:53.670]  Oh, here you go. Here's what I can do.
[21:54.170 --> 21:54.890]  Dortmund's duo.
[21:55.510 --> 21:59.690]  That is Borussia Dortmund, or BVB, from the German Bundesliga.
[21:59.830 --> 22:01.210]  German's professional soccer team.
[22:01.330 --> 22:07.250]  I know that because I shared an office with a guy who was a professional soccer player for that team at 17.
[22:07.470 --> 22:13.050]  An American who got bought by a team, dropped out of high school, went over to Germany, became a professional soccer player.
[22:13.410 --> 22:19.550]  Went up for a header, got hit by a player, had his back wrapped around the goal post, snapped his back in half.
[22:19.830 --> 22:20.930]  Ended his career. 17.
[22:22.390 --> 22:23.710]  Oh my god!
[22:24.450 --> 22:25.190]  I told you I could talk soccer.
[22:27.390 --> 22:28.950]  You can mark that for a social clip.
[22:33.370 --> 22:36.350]  That's an insane story I've never heard.
[22:36.550 --> 22:36.710]  Yeah.
[22:36.970 --> 22:38.270]  What the fuck?
[22:38.350 --> 22:40.990]  Gus knows him. He was like in our friend group. He was one of our best friends.
[22:41.590 --> 22:42.910]  He worked at the call center?
[22:43.330 --> 22:43.610]  Yeah.
[22:43.870 --> 22:44.450]  Are you serious?
[22:44.570 --> 22:47.690]  He managed it with me. He's the one that told me I could never work there again if I couldn't.
[22:49.730 --> 22:52.690]  He's like, if you leave this, you're leaving it for good. I'll never hire you back.
[22:52.770 --> 22:54.250]  Okay, I'll take that risk.
[22:54.330 --> 22:55.090]  Get this guy on anime.
[22:55.530 --> 22:57.630]  He's also very, very, very funny.
[22:57.750 --> 22:57.950]  Okay.
[22:58.210 --> 22:58.890]  Very naturally funny.
[22:59.090 --> 22:59.270]  Man.
[23:00.050 --> 23:01.170]  Brian, good one.
[23:01.230 --> 23:01.510]  Alright.
[23:01.910 --> 23:02.850]  I like these cards.
[23:02.970 --> 23:05.250]  Brandon Nemo. Yeah, these are like old-timey looking.
[23:06.670 --> 23:07.390]  Tijuan Walker.
[23:07.610 --> 23:08.190]  Taiwan Walker.
[23:08.310 --> 23:08.690]  There you go.
[23:09.370 --> 23:10.090]  Lance Lyons.
[23:10.850 --> 23:11.510]  Tomato, tomato.
[23:11.670 --> 23:12.190]  Yeah, Lance Lynn.
[23:12.390 --> 23:12.830]  Gary Sanchez.
[23:13.610 --> 23:13.830]  Okay.
[23:15.690 --> 23:16.410]  Oh, here we go.
[23:16.530 --> 23:16.670]  Yep.
[23:17.330 --> 23:19.390]  Swanson's Blast ties it in the seven.
[23:19.970 --> 23:22.610]  His name is Dansby Swanson.
[23:22.850 --> 23:23.370]  Dansby Swanson.
[23:23.510 --> 23:25.110]  That is a baseball name.
[23:25.530 --> 23:26.810]  Jazz Chisholm.
[23:26.890 --> 23:27.710]  It's also a frozen dinner name.
[23:27.730 --> 23:28.350]  It is.
[23:28.730 --> 23:32.310]  Jazz Chisholm and Dansby Swanson, I think, are two of my favorite baseball names right now.
[23:32.310 --> 23:33.310]  I like Jazz Chisholm a lot.
[23:33.350 --> 23:33.830]  Yeah, it's a good one.
[23:33.990 --> 23:34.910]  He's my current favorite name.
[23:36.710 --> 23:37.510]  Tony Santelan.
[23:37.690 --> 23:38.150]  Got it.
[23:38.550 --> 23:38.710]  Yeah.
[23:41.070 --> 23:43.330]  Isaiah is either catching or sliding.
[23:43.410 --> 23:45.230]  They call him IKF.
[23:45.230 --> 23:46.410]  Jordan Luplo.
[23:47.210 --> 23:47.810]  Or Looplo.
[23:48.250 --> 23:48.450]  Mm-hmm.
[23:49.170 --> 23:50.370]  I hate that guy.
[23:50.690 --> 23:51.310]  You don't like that guy?
[23:51.410 --> 23:54.870]  He's a diamondback and you just see him all year and you just go, this fucking guy again.
[23:55.150 --> 23:55.850]  Fucking this dude.
[23:55.870 --> 23:58.930]  To me, that was Paul Goldschmidt before he left for the Diamondbacks.
[23:59.050 --> 23:59.070]  Oh, yeah.
[23:59.070 --> 23:59.550]  Controversial, that Paul Goldschmidt.
[23:59.550 --> 24:01.770]  You just see Paul Goldschmidt all the fucking time.
[24:02.350 --> 24:03.350]  How much time we got left?
[24:04.710 --> 24:06.250]  Let's say two hours.
[24:06.590 --> 24:06.850]  Whoa.
[24:06.990 --> 24:11.450]  Oh, about... we still have... I mean, we can go until three.
[24:11.650 --> 24:12.950]  So we got an hour and a half still.
[24:13.550 --> 24:14.170]  So we got tons of time.
[24:14.170 --> 24:14.710]  Oh, we got...
[24:14.710 --> 24:15.510]  Baby, we got tons of time.
[24:15.550 --> 24:15.930]  How about this?
[24:16.130 --> 24:16.250]  Yeah.
[24:16.330 --> 24:17.170]  How long have we been going for?
[24:17.570 --> 24:17.870]  Half hour?
[24:17.930 --> 24:18.190]  Half hour.
[24:18.630 --> 24:18.810]  Okay.
[24:19.990 --> 24:20.170]  Why?
[24:20.210 --> 24:20.530]  What are you doing?
[24:20.830 --> 24:22.150]  I was just wondering when I want to pull other stuff out.
[24:22.150 --> 24:23.170]  You're going to make this... you're going to do this?
[24:23.210 --> 24:23.650]  You're going to make it happen?
[24:24.410 --> 24:25.410]  I just want to show it off.
[24:25.550 --> 24:25.970]  Let's do it.
[24:26.050 --> 24:27.150]  Do we have a piece of paper or something?
[24:27.310 --> 24:27.570]  Oh!
[24:28.770 --> 24:29.050]  Leslie...
[24:29.050 --> 24:29.750]  Oh, you know what we have?
[24:30.110 --> 24:33.470]  ...our intrepid associate producer helped us out for this.
[24:33.490 --> 24:33.830]  That looks even better.
[24:34.210 --> 24:38.290]  She gave us very large yellow paper and normal-sized white paper.
[24:38.910 --> 24:40.950]  Gavin had, on the main show...
[24:40.950 --> 24:41.110]  Yeah.
[24:41.330 --> 24:43.070]  ...a fantastic idea recently.
[24:43.070 --> 24:43.510]  Okay.
[24:43.890 --> 24:48.130]  His idea was that we should get actual Vancouver child kicker boots made.
[24:48.470 --> 24:48.710]  Mm-hmm.
[24:48.870 --> 24:50.550]  That then we could step in paint...
[24:50.550 --> 24:50.570]  Right.
[24:50.630 --> 24:51.410]  ...and then kick stuff.
[24:51.490 --> 24:51.690]  Right.
[24:51.950 --> 24:53.510]  So we set about doing that.
[24:53.630 --> 24:53.790]  Uh-huh.
[24:53.830 --> 24:57.070]  You said, and this is my favorite thing about you, you said, I'll look into it.
[24:57.130 --> 24:57.290]  Yep.
[24:57.430 --> 24:58.250]  And then I knew you were.
[24:58.710 --> 25:01.170]  It turns out we couldn't feasibly get that done.
[25:01.490 --> 25:01.850]  But we got...
[25:01.850 --> 25:03.070]  Getting a boot made.
[25:03.630 --> 25:03.850]  Yeah.
[25:04.270 --> 25:04.510]  Tough.
[25:04.870 --> 25:09.250]  But we were able to get a facsimile of a boot made.
[25:09.370 --> 25:09.650]  Mm-hmm.
[25:10.190 --> 25:11.710]  Here, I'll move it up to the thing.
[25:13.570 --> 25:14.810]  Look at this.
[25:14.930 --> 25:15.430]  Now, this is...
[25:15.430 --> 25:20.170]  This is the official Vancouver child kicker boot stamp?
[25:20.170 --> 25:20.610]  Boot stamp.
[25:21.170 --> 25:22.810]  Yeah, see, on this side...
[25:22.810 --> 25:25.070]  We've got a full, size 10 and a half...
[25:25.070 --> 25:25.810]  This is the...
[25:25.810 --> 25:26.850]  ...a full boot stamp made.
[25:27.010 --> 25:29.850]  This show is insane because we get stuff like this made.
[25:30.090 --> 25:32.750]  So now we can either just use it like this...
[25:32.750 --> 25:32.810]  Uh-huh.
[25:33.210 --> 25:34.010]  ...or we can...
[25:34.010 --> 25:34.250]  Boom!
[25:34.270 --> 25:35.370]  ...build a contraption...
[25:35.370 --> 25:35.450]  Yeah.
[25:35.570 --> 25:37.650]  ...to put our feet in and get one flip...
[25:37.650 --> 25:37.790]  That's true.
[25:37.790 --> 25:39.190]  ...and then we can kick stuff.
[25:39.390 --> 25:41.930]  We all really wanted Andrew to kick stuff.
[25:42.130 --> 25:42.230]  Yeah.
[25:42.890 --> 25:43.250]  But...
[25:43.250 --> 25:44.550]  Are we gonna give this thing a shot?
[25:44.630 --> 25:45.130]  I think we're gonna give it a shot.
[25:45.130 --> 25:47.270]  This is gonna be the first stamp we make with this.
[25:47.390 --> 25:48.030]  Yeah, the very first.
[25:48.150 --> 25:48.890]  This is pretty exciting.
[25:49.210 --> 25:51.210]  I've never seen it in person until about an hour ago.
[25:52.270 --> 25:53.010]  What are those?
[25:53.150 --> 25:53.630]  Oh, shit.
[25:54.490 --> 25:55.530]  It just got complicated.
[25:55.870 --> 25:56.650]  What is this?
[25:56.730 --> 25:57.330]  Stamp ink.
[25:58.550 --> 26:01.210]  Do we need to ink up the pad first?
[26:01.430 --> 26:02.210]  Let's find out.
[26:02.410 --> 26:03.330]  I have a feeling.
[26:03.450 --> 26:04.090]  Yes, we do.
[26:04.310 --> 26:05.270]  Oh, why?
[26:05.950 --> 26:07.310]  Why don't they put stuff together?
[26:08.230 --> 26:08.770]  Don't worry.
[26:08.870 --> 26:11.730]  We have interns here to help us ink pads.
[26:14.270 --> 26:15.670]  They're just gonna be really careful.
[26:18.670 --> 26:20.350]  Oh, there's no ink on that.
[26:20.530 --> 26:22.070]  I've never seen an inkless pad before.
[26:22.070 --> 26:22.390]  Me neither.
[26:22.490 --> 26:23.030]  That's pretty interesting.
[26:23.050 --> 26:23.930]  This is just good for science.
[26:24.070 --> 26:24.290]  Look at that.
[26:25.210 --> 26:26.750]  That's how they come before they're inked.
[26:26.790 --> 26:29.050]  This pad is shipped dry to prevent accidental leaking.
[26:29.450 --> 26:32.030]  The ink pad is perfect for extra large stamps.
[26:32.130 --> 26:32.670]  Yeah, no, I get it.
[26:32.990 --> 26:35.410]  The pad requires about three ounces of ink for initial setup.
[26:36.010 --> 26:39.250]  How much ounces is 60 milliliters?
[26:40.290 --> 26:42.150]  I don't know if this fucking thing fits.
[26:42.710 --> 26:43.110]  What?
[26:43.510 --> 26:43.910]  Yeah.
[26:44.210 --> 26:44.450]  Come on.
[26:46.450 --> 26:47.050]  Surely it will.
[26:47.510 --> 26:50.850]  It may take up for three hours for the ink to completely soak in.
[26:53.130 --> 26:54.730]  Alright, well, you've seen it.
[26:55.110 --> 26:56.750]  We'll try it in like 45 minutes.
[26:57.410 --> 26:58.670]  Are we gonna... alright.
[26:58.850 --> 26:59.570]  Let's just ink her up.
[27:00.110 --> 27:00.810]  Let's set it off to the side.
[27:00.810 --> 27:01.290]  Here you go.
[27:02.490 --> 27:03.550]  We'll come back to that.
[27:04.550 --> 27:06.710]  Boy, I should have read that up earlier, huh?
[27:07.310 --> 27:08.150]  I believe in you guys.
[27:08.410 --> 27:08.790]  Hang on.
[27:11.310 --> 27:12.710]  They only use one.
[27:13.450 --> 27:14.970]  It shows you how to do it on the back.
[27:17.190 --> 27:18.410]  This show sucks.
[27:19.590 --> 27:21.330]  I could say that about my whole career.
[27:22.810 --> 27:24.530]  Let's open two more packs of wrestlers.
[27:25.050 --> 27:25.370]  We like them.
[27:25.370 --> 27:26.430]  Oh, cool. Let's do it.
[27:27.490 --> 27:30.690]  Hopefully you have some more interesting facts like, he's British.
[27:30.950 --> 27:32.250]  Yeah, I mean, I like him.
[27:32.250 --> 27:33.340]  Mustache Mountain's a cool team.
[27:34.990 --> 27:35.670]  Mustache Mountain?
[27:35.730 --> 27:39.810]  Yeah, he has a mustache and he was a part of British Drunk Style with Pete Dunn and Tyler Bate.
[27:39.950 --> 27:41.310]  And they were in a group called Mustache Mountain.
[27:41.670 --> 27:43.690]  And it was just a rip-off of Peaky Blinders, but it was fun.
[27:43.990 --> 27:44.710]  Tyler Bate?
[27:44.770 --> 27:45.810]  Yeah, it was pretty cool, right?
[27:45.990 --> 27:46.250]  Yeah.
[27:48.590 --> 27:51.510]  Mustafa Ali is a great professional wrestler.
[27:51.910 --> 27:54.730]  Wrestled with a friend of mine in Chicago for a while.
[27:54.790 --> 27:55.670]  And then got signed to WWE.
[27:56.110 --> 27:58.170]  Sat out for a while because he wasn't happy with where things were going.
[27:58.270 --> 27:59.870]  And now he's back, baby.
[28:00.750 --> 28:01.450]  In the WWE?
[28:01.450 --> 28:02.070]  Yes, sir.
[28:03.570 --> 28:04.650]  Broderick Strong?
[28:05.090 --> 28:06.390]  Broderick Strong.
[28:06.750 --> 28:09.350]  He's doing his infamous move, the Stronghold.
[28:10.510 --> 28:12.210]  He is the messiah of the Backbreaker.
[28:12.610 --> 28:15.510]  He's a former PWG champion.
[28:16.630 --> 28:20.490]  Former NXT North American champion.
[28:20.850 --> 28:22.090]  Former tag team champion.
[28:22.470 --> 28:25.750]  I've seen him wrestle live dozens of times.
[28:26.370 --> 28:28.550]  What is the messiah of the Backbreaker?
[28:28.550 --> 28:35.390]  His gimmick on the indies in 2005 was that everything he did was into a backbreaker.
[28:35.550 --> 28:39.570]  It would be like a guy throws a clothesline, he catches it, and throws it into a backbreaker.
[28:40.330 --> 28:42.930]  Everything he does is into a backbreaker, and it looks very cool.
[28:43.270 --> 28:44.250]  And he's strong as fuck.
[28:44.850 --> 28:46.290]  He's a little guy. He's probably about my size.
[28:47.770 --> 28:48.810]  That's wrestlers now.
[28:48.970 --> 28:51.630]  It's just nerds who grew up watching wrestling who are my size.
[28:51.930 --> 28:52.310]  And you go...
[28:52.310 --> 28:53.170]  But jacked as fuck.
[28:53.490 --> 28:54.470]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[28:54.570 --> 28:55.590]  Because they work out.
[28:57.470 --> 28:57.950]  Explain.
[28:59.490 --> 29:00.610]  Is that Primate?
[29:00.790 --> 29:01.010]  Yes.
[29:01.050 --> 29:03.930]  That guy's a guy from NXT UK.
[29:04.790 --> 29:10.430]  There was a time when WWE was buying up all of the UK talent.
[29:10.690 --> 29:13.250]  Because they're like, we're gonna expand into the UK.
[29:13.550 --> 29:16.670]  And then that really backfired, and now they have a guy named Primate.
[29:17.870 --> 29:19.510]  It's like a Bane type thing?
[29:19.770 --> 29:21.310]  I mean, I think that's what they're going for.
[29:21.310 --> 29:25.450]  You can tell it's pro wrestling because he's wearing camo pants and a cool little mask.
[29:25.590 --> 29:28.130]  I'm gonna say he looks British to me.
[29:28.410 --> 29:28.890]  Yes.
[29:29.390 --> 29:31.030]  I don't know what it is about him.
[29:31.110 --> 29:32.350]  He looks like he's about to go...
[29:36.390 --> 29:38.070]  And then Sasha Banks.
[29:38.130 --> 29:42.030]  Sasha Banks recently quit WWE for a second time.
[29:43.630 --> 29:45.870]  The rumor is that she's released now.
[29:46.170 --> 29:46.890]  We don't know.
[29:47.070 --> 29:47.670]  Nobody knows.
[29:47.870 --> 29:49.950]  The best part of pro wrestling is probably the gossip.
[29:51.310 --> 29:52.370]  What's the hot gossip these days?
[29:52.590 --> 29:52.870]  Her!
[29:53.170 --> 29:53.470]  Leaving!
[29:53.650 --> 29:55.930]  She walked out in the middle of Monday Night Raw.
[29:56.150 --> 29:56.170]  Why?
[29:56.510 --> 29:58.810]  Because she wasn't happy with the direction of this stuff.
[29:58.890 --> 30:01.450]  So her and another woman, Naomi, both left.
[30:01.790 --> 30:02.770]  And have not been on TV.
[30:03.070 --> 30:04.730]  They've been posting on social media and stuff.
[30:04.850 --> 30:07.030]  But nobody knows if they're still contracted or not.
[30:07.150 --> 30:07.630]  Fucking cool.
[30:07.870 --> 30:09.030]  She's also Snoop Dogg's cousin.
[30:11.050 --> 30:11.370]  Yeah.
[30:15.130 --> 30:15.570]  Valentina...
[30:15.570 --> 30:16.290]  Farose?
[30:16.430 --> 30:16.870]  Faraz?
[30:18.970 --> 30:21.050]  I have no idea who this is.
[30:21.810 --> 30:23.110]  Who the fuck is this?
[30:23.230 --> 30:24.390]  Oh, she's on NXT now.
[30:24.550 --> 30:24.770]  That's why.
[30:24.970 --> 30:25.490]  I don't watch it anymore.
[30:25.710 --> 30:25.810]  Sorry.
[30:26.610 --> 30:27.410]  Sam Stoker!
[30:28.430 --> 30:28.750]  Oh!
[30:29.170 --> 30:32.070]  This guy is one half of a tag team called Pretty Deadly.
[30:32.250 --> 30:34.410]  And their gimmick is they're very attractive.
[30:37.410 --> 30:38.630]  I think it's great.
[30:38.810 --> 30:39.710]  I think it's a great gimmick.
[30:39.810 --> 30:40.770]  Are they very attractive?
[30:40.850 --> 30:41.670]  I mean, look at him.
[30:41.770 --> 30:43.250]  He's a handsome boy.
[30:43.450 --> 30:44.290]  Oh, he's also very British.
[30:45.090 --> 30:45.590]  You know what I mean?
[30:45.770 --> 30:45.970]  Like...
[30:46.670 --> 30:49.890]  He's handsome for a British guy, so he's like an Austin Six.
[30:51.450 --> 30:52.170]  James Drake!
[30:52.390 --> 30:53.690]  He's also a British guy.
[30:54.650 --> 30:56.210]  I feel like this guy is half a year.
[30:56.350 --> 30:56.670]  I don't remember.
[30:56.790 --> 30:57.790]  I feel like he'd be an Austin Seven.
[30:58.050 --> 30:58.330]  Yeah.
[30:58.770 --> 30:59.270]  Yeah, I agree.
[31:00.090 --> 31:00.810]  And then...
[31:00.810 --> 31:01.750]  Oh, you know this dude.
[31:03.230 --> 31:03.950]  It's the...
[31:04.550 --> 31:05.450]  The Brawny Man.
[31:06.530 --> 31:06.690]  Right?
[31:06.990 --> 31:07.850]  Brock Lesnar's back.
[31:07.930 --> 31:10.270]  He's gonna wrestle Roman Reigns at SummerSlam.
[31:11.230 --> 31:12.390]  Roman Reigns is the number one guy.
[31:12.550 --> 31:13.050]  Yeah, he is.
[31:13.130 --> 31:13.730]  He's the champion.
[31:13.910 --> 31:15.010]  And Brock Lesnar's gonna fight him.
[31:15.010 --> 31:15.850]  Do you think he'll win?
[31:16.710 --> 31:17.110]  I don't know.
[31:17.250 --> 31:17.630]  Probably not.
[31:17.750 --> 31:18.030]  I think...
[31:18.590 --> 31:21.570]  I think Roman Reigns is gonna hold the title for a very long time.
[31:21.690 --> 31:22.870]  He's already had it for a very long time.
[31:22.910 --> 31:23.910]  He's gonna hold it for even longer.
[31:24.270 --> 31:25.090]  Why do you think that is?
[31:25.370 --> 31:25.750]  Uh...
[31:25.750 --> 31:27.070]  They're trying to make...
[31:27.070 --> 31:29.690]  I think they want him to wrestle The Rock at WrestleMania.
[31:30.250 --> 31:30.630]  Oh.
[31:31.030 --> 31:31.370]  Okay.
[31:31.550 --> 31:32.090]  I think that...
[31:32.090 --> 31:32.750]  Because that's his cousin.
[31:32.850 --> 31:33.970]  The Rock's cousin is Roman Reigns.
[31:34.230 --> 31:34.850]  No shit.
[31:35.550 --> 31:35.750]  Huh.
[31:35.950 --> 31:38.590]  So, I think that they want him to wrestle The Rock.
[31:39.370 --> 31:41.410]  And The Rock is, what, like 50?
[31:42.050 --> 31:42.430]  So...
[31:42.530 --> 31:45.370]  And the last time he wrestled, he, like, tore everything out of his body.
[31:45.850 --> 31:46.290]  It was pretty bad.
[31:46.850 --> 31:47.410]  Did he really?
[31:47.570 --> 31:47.750]  Yeah.
[31:47.830 --> 31:50.430]  He, like, he, like, tore, like, a rib, like, totally off.
[31:50.510 --> 31:51.030]  Like, it was bad.
[31:51.330 --> 31:56.150]  When you do human growth hormone, your muscles don't grow right.
[31:56.270 --> 31:56.910]  They just grow.
[31:57.090 --> 31:58.330]  And then they tear really easily.
[31:58.330 --> 32:01.270]  Are you telling me The Rock does steroids?
[32:02.410 --> 32:03.910]  He's not 100% natural.
[32:06.670 --> 32:07.470]  Hey, fuckfacers.
[32:08.330 --> 32:10.590]  Glad you guys enjoyed the cards last stream.
[32:10.590 --> 32:12.770]  Found a few more cards I thought you'd enjoy.
[32:13.190 --> 32:14.910]  And here you'll find a classic white sock.
[32:15.510 --> 32:18.170]  Some of Eric's political and sports heroes.
[32:18.310 --> 32:20.090]  A familiar face in an unfamiliar uniform.
[32:20.230 --> 32:20.670]  What does that mean?
[32:20.690 --> 32:23.550]  And a pitcher who may have had the shittiest day at the ballpark ever.
[32:23.850 --> 32:24.390]  Love the show.
[32:24.510 --> 32:25.410]  Thanks for the years of content.
[32:25.530 --> 32:26.190]  Thanks, Joel.
[32:26.450 --> 32:27.210]  It's, uh...
[32:27.210 --> 32:28.190]  Oh, thank you, Joel.
[32:28.850 --> 32:29.430]  Joel or Bear.
[32:29.590 --> 32:30.310]  He, um...
[32:30.310 --> 32:30.790]  What do you guys buy?
[32:30.930 --> 32:32.950]  I don't know why he said, my political...
[32:32.950 --> 32:33.410]  What is that?
[32:33.450 --> 32:33.970]  We're gonna find out.
[32:33.970 --> 32:34.690]  I don't know.
[32:34.930 --> 32:35.650]  This is scary.
[32:36.050 --> 32:36.450]  All right, here we go.
[32:36.650 --> 32:37.690]  Oh, this one's got a story.
[32:37.870 --> 32:38.150]  Ooh.
[32:38.150 --> 32:38.810]  Okay.
[32:40.690 --> 32:41.050]  He's...
[32:41.050 --> 32:45.130]  Joel is the guy who sent us the card of the guy who got caught jerking off in his car.
[32:45.630 --> 32:46.790]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:46.830 --> 32:46.990]  Yeah.
[32:47.230 --> 32:47.950]  Oh, my God.
[32:48.070 --> 32:48.630]  Okay, hold on.
[32:48.670 --> 32:49.610]  Let me pull the card out first.
[32:49.730 --> 32:50.870]  Then Joel's got a whole story for us.
[32:51.190 --> 32:51.550]  Joel...
[32:51.550 --> 32:52.950]  Story time with Joel is really great.
[32:53.170 --> 32:53.830]  He's got a whole thing.
[32:54.130 --> 32:54.350]  Shit.
[32:54.750 --> 32:55.270]  I think you're okay.
[32:55.610 --> 32:56.150]  Oh, fuck.
[32:57.110 --> 32:57.470]  What's this?
[32:57.630 --> 32:58.070]  Uh-oh.
[32:59.530 --> 33:00.250]  This is...
[33:00.250 --> 33:00.890]  Archie Bradley.
[33:01.090 --> 33:01.430]  Okay.
[33:01.750 --> 33:02.050]  Okay.
[33:03.250 --> 33:07.450]  On May 5th, 2018, allegedly, by Joel...
[33:07.450 --> 33:08.710]  I have no idea what I'm about to read.
[33:09.070 --> 33:13.210]  Archie Bradley ran desperately to the bathroom, seeking to free himself from the torment of
[33:13.210 --> 33:14.270]  an overfull bladder.
[33:14.650 --> 33:19.170]  Reaching the urinal just in time, he may have freed himself a bit too much, as to his dismay,
[33:19.270 --> 33:20.770]  he realized he just shit himself.
[33:21.290 --> 33:23.970]  As unfortunate as this is, the timing was worse.
[33:24.190 --> 33:27.290]  He was three minutes from pitching and the top of the sixth inning versus the Houston
[33:27.290 --> 33:27.810]  Astros.
[33:28.490 --> 33:29.410]  In his words.
[33:30.210 --> 33:33.090]  So it's a two-two count, and I'm like, man, I have to pee.
[33:33.190 --> 33:34.030]  I have to go pee.
[33:34.290 --> 33:37.530]  So I run into our bathroom real quick, I'm ready to go, and I'm trying to pee, and I'm
[33:37.530 --> 33:38.610]  actually shitting my pants.
[33:38.950 --> 33:41.330]  Like, right before I'm about to go in the game, I poop my pants.
[33:41.430 --> 33:42.690]  I'm like, oh my gosh.
[33:43.630 --> 33:44.470]  Oh my gosh.
[33:45.090 --> 33:48.710]  I know, I'm a pitch away from going in the game, so I'm scrambling to clean myself up.
[33:48.770 --> 33:52.430]  I get it cleaned up as best as I can, butt my pants up, and our bullpen coach, Mike Fetters,
[33:52.450 --> 33:53.650]  says, hey, you're in the game.
[33:53.810 --> 33:57.290]  So I'm jogging into the game to pitch with poop literally in my pants.
[33:57.290 --> 33:57.990]  No!
[33:59.270 --> 34:02.450]  But hey, he went out, got out of the inning without a run, so fuck the asterisk.
[34:04.750 --> 34:06.730]  Dude, Joel's like my new favorite.
[34:06.930 --> 34:07.270]  That's awesome.
[34:07.270 --> 34:08.150]  Joel, that's a great one.
[34:08.190 --> 34:08.990]  That is a great one.
[34:09.370 --> 34:10.670]  Probably mark that for a social clip.
[34:12.950 --> 34:15.010]  Archie Bradley shit his pants.
[34:16.830 --> 34:18.490]  I fucking hate the Diamondbacks.
[34:21.490 --> 34:22.250]  Oh, man.
[34:22.650 --> 34:24.230]  Yeah, these are like...
[34:24.230 --> 34:26.230]  I ran into Joel on Twitter.
[34:26.230 --> 34:28.190]  Dude, you're fucking... you're not gonna believe this.
[34:28.310 --> 34:28.610]  Oh, no.
[34:28.950 --> 34:32.010]  Ran into Joel on Twitter, and he's just like, I wanna send some stuff, and went, okay, cool.
[34:32.230 --> 34:33.270]  And he's a good dude.
[34:34.050 --> 34:35.070]  Got a garbage pail.
[34:35.290 --> 34:35.550]  What?
[34:36.390 --> 34:36.970]  Oh, boy.
[34:36.990 --> 34:37.510]  Rapping Ron.
[34:37.610 --> 34:39.010]  I think that's your political...
[34:39.010 --> 34:40.410]  I think this is right.
[34:40.530 --> 34:42.590]  So you remember when he got shot, right?
[34:42.830 --> 34:42.990]  Yeah.
[34:42.990 --> 34:44.130]  Was it like... it was like that?
[34:44.470 --> 34:45.470]  He was looking about like that, yeah.
[34:47.330 --> 34:48.050]  Henry Kissinger.
[34:48.050 --> 34:48.910]  What the fuck?
[34:49.630 --> 34:52.670]  We're just... these are just like war criminal cards?
[34:52.890 --> 34:53.330]  H-K-I.
[34:53.450 --> 34:54.710]  What the fuck?
[34:56.150 --> 34:57.470]  Oh, shit, here we go.
[34:57.770 --> 34:58.410]  This is a White Sock.
[34:59.610 --> 35:00.530]  I don't know if he was...
[35:00.530 --> 35:00.670]  Yeah.
[35:01.150 --> 35:01.590]  At that time.
[35:01.710 --> 35:02.650]  Paul Canerco auto.
[35:02.830 --> 35:03.990]  Oh, wow, really?
[35:04.290 --> 35:04.870]  He was first baseman.
[35:04.910 --> 35:06.050]  Dude, Paul Canerco, wow.
[35:06.070 --> 35:06.770]  This is shit, man.
[35:07.770 --> 35:08.450]  Oh, here we go.
[35:08.490 --> 35:11.010]  This is a little Dodgers for my girlfriend's dad.
[35:11.990 --> 35:12.710]  There's a fucking...
[35:13.570 --> 35:14.090]  Chris Taylor.
[35:14.170 --> 35:14.590]  Chris Taylor.
[35:15.310 --> 35:17.530]  That's a single patch card.
[35:17.570 --> 35:18.290]  A little color patch.
[35:18.630 --> 35:18.850]  That's cool.
[35:19.230 --> 35:20.290]  Oh, here you go.
[35:20.330 --> 35:20.970]  This is good for you.
[35:20.970 --> 35:25.250]  This is a Tony Gwynn with an authentic game-used badge.
[35:25.250 --> 35:25.830]  Oh, wow.
[35:25.890 --> 35:27.150]  Yeah, that's really lovely.
[35:27.850 --> 35:30.030]  That's how he hit one of his 3,000 hits with that.
[35:30.330 --> 35:35.050]  And then speak of the fucking devil, Eric Boom.
[35:35.170 --> 35:35.910]  No way!
[35:36.110 --> 35:36.730]  Padre Zim.
[35:36.750 --> 35:37.290]  We got the Padre Zim!
[35:37.790 --> 35:39.050]  Got the Padre Zim right there.
[35:39.070 --> 35:39.550]  Awesome.
[35:39.830 --> 35:40.430]  Thanks to Joel.
[35:40.590 --> 35:41.070]  Joel!
[35:41.330 --> 35:44.190]  We were just having a conversation about how we haven't seen a Padre Zim yet.
[35:44.430 --> 35:45.090]  Oh, wow.
[35:45.230 --> 35:46.170]  And there it is right there.
[35:46.170 --> 35:55.230]  If you're new to fuck, face, or face break shit, you should know that we are obsessed with and love all things...
[35:55.230 --> 35:56.190]  Wow, we got another...
[35:56.190 --> 35:57.290]  Wow, dude, that's a good Zim, too.
[35:57.590 --> 35:58.110]  That's a great Zim.
[35:58.290 --> 35:58.990]  It's in good shape, too.
[35:59.030 --> 35:59.230]  Yeah.
[35:59.790 --> 36:01.550]  A little Padre's Manager Zim action.
[36:02.650 --> 36:03.490]  Might get that graded.
[36:04.890 --> 36:05.210]  Yeah?
[36:05.690 --> 36:06.970]  I mean, they'll give it a 10 and...
[36:06.970 --> 36:07.970]  Bad cut on the back, but...
[36:07.970 --> 36:08.590]  They'll...
[36:09.090 --> 36:10.990]  They'll give it a 10 and then go, I mean, it's not worth anything.
[36:11.170 --> 36:11.530]  Yeah.
[36:12.530 --> 36:13.090]  After... shit.
[36:13.370 --> 36:15.570]  The Zimmer price has not completely gone back down.
[36:15.570 --> 36:17.170]  It's still elevated to where it's...
[36:17.170 --> 36:20.010]  I can't believe that we had an effect on the market like that.
[36:20.010 --> 36:20.570]  For a long time.
[36:20.690 --> 36:23.490]  I mean, you were saying that you were signing a lot of Zims when you were doing...
[36:23.490 --> 36:25.410]  I probably signed, yeah, at least 10 or 15.
[36:25.710 --> 36:26.070]  Wow.
[36:26.670 --> 36:27.430]  I would say when I was...
[36:27.430 --> 36:28.070]  That's insane.
[36:28.250 --> 36:29.130]  I'm gonna pull from the pack sack.
[36:29.370 --> 36:30.570]  Oh, we have RTX coming up.
[36:30.750 --> 36:31.710]  Bring a Zim to RTX.
[36:32.410 --> 36:32.770]  Hollywood...
[36:32.770 --> 36:37.030]  This is the Hollywood premiere set walk of fame trading cards.
[36:37.130 --> 36:37.810]  These suck.
[36:38.170 --> 36:38.330]  Official...
[36:38.870 --> 36:40.130]  These cards suck.
[36:40.230 --> 36:40.910]  These are gonna be great.
[36:41.770 --> 36:42.630]  This is gonna be really great.
[36:42.630 --> 36:43.790]  We had these before.
[36:43.930 --> 36:44.230]  Yeah.
[36:44.230 --> 36:46.350]  It's like the same 11 cards.
[36:46.370 --> 36:46.870]  I know.
[36:47.930 --> 36:49.170]  Edward G. Robinson.
[36:49.670 --> 36:50.130]  Yeah, see?
[36:53.050 --> 36:53.970]  Dinah Shore.
[36:54.170 --> 36:55.210]  What the fuck?
[36:56.310 --> 36:56.870]  She's...
[36:56.870 --> 36:58.530]  Dinah Shore shows just before my time.
[36:59.550 --> 37:01.350]  As is Nanette Fabry.
[37:01.490 --> 37:01.770]  Wow.
[37:02.610 --> 37:03.270]  Oh, here we go.
[37:03.530 --> 37:04.350]  Vera Miles.
[37:05.410 --> 37:06.470]  And we got...
[37:07.790 --> 37:08.470]  Johnny Cash.
[37:08.470 --> 37:09.570]  Johnny Cash.
[37:09.970 --> 37:10.510]  That's...
[37:10.510 --> 37:10.850]  Wow.
[37:11.090 --> 37:12.710]  That's a terrible picture of that man.
[37:12.710 --> 37:13.470]  That is not a great photo.
[37:13.510 --> 37:14.210]  Oh, that's sad.
[37:14.310 --> 37:15.230]  Catherine Grayson.
[37:16.530 --> 37:17.530]  Ooh, Clayton Moore.
[37:17.670 --> 37:19.250]  I guess he was the Lone Ranger.
[37:19.250 --> 37:19.690]  Lone Ranger.
[37:19.770 --> 37:20.290]  Back in the day.
[37:20.410 --> 37:20.570]  Yep.
[37:21.070 --> 37:21.890]  Ooh, here we go.
[37:22.330 --> 37:23.070]  Charles Bronski.
[37:23.450 --> 37:24.170]  All right.
[37:24.590 --> 37:25.010]  I'm gonna pull that one.
[37:25.010 --> 37:27.490]  I think he's definitely on the set of a Death Wish movie.
[37:27.790 --> 37:29.110]  Well, what else would he be on the set?
[37:29.550 --> 37:29.650]  Yeah.
[37:31.990 --> 37:32.710]  Sid Charisse.
[37:34.530 --> 37:36.370]  Ooh, the gambler Kenny Rogers.
[37:36.450 --> 37:36.790]  Nice.
[37:36.870 --> 37:37.830]  Wearing a tall hat.
[37:37.870 --> 37:39.450]  You seen him in His Giant Sons?
[37:40.190 --> 37:40.390]  Yeah.
[37:40.510 --> 37:41.370]  He has giant sons.
[37:41.370 --> 37:41.670]  Big sons.
[37:41.810 --> 37:42.730]  He had big ol' sons.
[37:42.870 --> 37:43.110]  Hey, Eric.
[37:43.270 --> 37:43.470]  Yeah.
[37:43.710 --> 37:44.530]  What's a Tim Conway?
[37:44.930 --> 37:45.310]  Hey!
[37:45.590 --> 37:46.090]  I like that.
[37:46.110 --> 37:46.610]  About 120 pounds.
[37:46.650 --> 37:47.070]  That's pretty good.
[37:47.850 --> 37:49.650]  And the Queen Diva herself, Angela.
[37:49.850 --> 37:50.230]  Beautiful.
[37:50.670 --> 37:51.790]  These were not terrible.
[37:51.990 --> 37:52.390]  Those were not terrible.
[37:52.390 --> 37:55.250]  Those were probably better than any other pack of those we've ever opened.
[37:55.270 --> 37:55.590]  Oh, yeah.
[37:55.650 --> 37:55.930]  Easily.
[37:56.050 --> 37:57.290]  And they didn't stick together, which is nice.
[37:57.370 --> 37:58.050]  Yeah, this...
[37:58.650 --> 37:59.790]  How much time do we have left?
[38:00.230 --> 38:00.870]  You keep...
[38:00.870 --> 38:04.110]  It's only been 10 minutes since the last time you asked me.
[38:04.530 --> 38:07.330]  Where do you think that box of cards I had is?
[38:07.670 --> 38:08.050]  What?
[38:08.950 --> 38:10.490]  What are you talking about?
[38:10.490 --> 38:15.990]  I had a box of 89 Fleer Complete Set that I was going to use.
[38:15.990 --> 38:16.670]  Are they in your cars?
[38:18.070 --> 38:18.390]  Well...
[38:18.390 --> 38:19.130]  Are they, though?
[38:19.370 --> 38:20.270]  Yeah, I bet they are.
[38:20.390 --> 38:20.630]  Oh, well.
[38:21.510 --> 38:23.410]  That's what I was going to use to burn this thing with.
[38:23.530 --> 38:23.950]  Oh, no.
[38:25.230 --> 38:26.090]  But here's what I can do.
[38:26.230 --> 38:26.410]  Yeah.
[38:26.590 --> 38:27.770]  I'll just do one for the hell of it.
[38:27.850 --> 38:28.250]  We'll do Tim Conway.
[38:28.250 --> 38:28.830]  Oh, Tim Conway!
[38:29.170 --> 38:29.530]  All right.
[38:29.610 --> 38:31.010]  So you want to explain what this thing is?
[38:31.190 --> 38:33.570]  Yeah, so this is a gold embosser.
[38:33.830 --> 38:34.750]  And so...
[38:34.750 --> 38:36.610]  This is crazy.
[38:36.970 --> 38:40.050]  What you do is you buy, like, foil, like gold foil, like this.
[38:40.050 --> 38:40.770]  We Ian-ed it.
[38:40.850 --> 38:45.190]  And then you turn this guy on, find the appropriate temperature, superheat it, and then you put
[38:45.190 --> 38:47.350]  a brass plate of a design under it.
[38:47.630 --> 38:52.530]  I went to Etsy and I found a lovely lady who makes brass plates of things, and I had her
[38:52.530 --> 38:53.550]  make this design.
[38:53.670 --> 38:56.430]  So you have to, like, line it up a certain way on your...
[38:56.450 --> 38:57.930]  It's actually quite hard to do upside down.
[38:58.190 --> 38:58.670]  Oh, great.
[38:59.090 --> 39:00.390]  I mean, you could turn it around.
[39:00.550 --> 39:01.030]  No, that's okay.
[39:01.110 --> 39:01.490]  I won't do that.
[39:02.470 --> 39:02.930]  You're right.
[39:03.850 --> 39:04.610]  No, yeah, you're right.
[39:06.750 --> 39:07.070]  Oh.
[39:08.030 --> 39:09.310]  We'll get it to about...
[39:09.310 --> 39:10.210]  Is it 191 degrees?
[39:10.310 --> 39:10.830]  That's about right.
[39:10.850 --> 39:12.030]  That is absolutely right.
[39:12.110 --> 39:12.530]  This size.
[39:12.690 --> 39:12.890]  Okay.
[39:13.070 --> 39:16.190]  I find 155 degrees is the best for smaller sizes.
[39:16.550 --> 39:16.850]  Okay.
[39:16.870 --> 39:18.070]  I did a lot of testing.
[39:18.950 --> 39:19.890]  There's a lot happening right now.
[39:20.170 --> 39:21.390]  And you pour the...
[39:21.390 --> 39:22.390]  Well, let's go further.
[39:22.970 --> 39:23.850]  Do we have any...
[39:25.210 --> 39:26.490]  I don't know what you need.
[39:28.130 --> 39:29.310]  A cutting tool.
[39:30.770 --> 39:31.070]  Okay.
[39:31.250 --> 39:31.750]  Well, alright.
[39:33.250 --> 39:33.650]  Well...
[39:34.430 --> 39:34.830]  Okay.
[39:35.010 --> 39:35.610]  You got it.
[39:35.610 --> 39:36.230]  Yeah.
[39:36.810 --> 39:36.950]  Okay.
[39:37.430 --> 39:38.670]  So what are these then?
[39:38.910 --> 39:39.890]  Those are the...
[39:39.890 --> 39:40.870]  These are former Ian's?
[39:40.990 --> 39:41.750]  Former Ian's, yeah.
[39:41.910 --> 39:42.010]  Oh.
[39:42.450 --> 39:43.610]  A little hard to see, but...
[39:45.370 --> 39:46.350]  Probably a little easier to see this way.
[39:47.150 --> 39:47.530]  Ian's.
[39:49.030 --> 39:49.430]  Okay.
[39:49.650 --> 39:50.270]  Is that right?
[39:50.930 --> 39:51.890]  Those are nice Ian's.
[39:53.010 --> 39:53.830]  Goddammit, it moved.
[39:54.910 --> 39:56.630]  It's really fucking hard to do upside down.
[39:56.750 --> 39:56.930]  Okay.
[39:57.690 --> 39:58.590]  Nick, look at the shirt.
[40:00.570 --> 40:01.370]  Three, three...
[40:01.370 --> 40:01.810]  Oh, what?
[40:03.110 --> 40:04.150]  Don't tell anyone, though.
[40:04.210 --> 40:04.330]  Oh.
[40:04.330 --> 40:04.770]  Okay.
[40:05.350 --> 40:05.770]  Go ahead.
[40:07.730 --> 40:09.150]  I wanted Nick to look at the shirt.
[40:09.950 --> 40:11.150]  Okay, so this is it, right?
[40:11.210 --> 40:11.970]  Then we stamp it down.
[40:12.050 --> 40:12.270]  Okay.
[40:12.550 --> 40:12.990]  Nice and easy?
[40:15.090 --> 40:15.990]  That's awesome!
[40:16.230 --> 40:17.050]  So what's...
[40:17.050 --> 40:18.290]  Why are we doing this?
[40:19.570 --> 40:20.030]  So...
[40:20.030 --> 40:22.750]  A while back, when I did the...
[40:22.750 --> 40:23.950]  When we did the wrist pockets...
[40:23.950 --> 40:24.110]  Yeah.
[40:24.430 --> 40:25.750]  I made...
[40:26.330 --> 40:27.170]  50 of these.
[40:27.310 --> 40:28.330]  Some special ones.
[40:29.670 --> 40:30.130]  And...
[40:30.130 --> 40:31.990]  That I included as giveaways.
[40:31.990 --> 40:35.890]  I thought it would be fun at RTX to make 100 of these.
[40:36.190 --> 40:36.470]  Wow!
[40:36.670 --> 40:37.750]  Well, I'm not going to make them at RTX.
[40:37.850 --> 40:38.510]  I'm going to make them at home.
[40:38.670 --> 40:38.730]  Whoa.
[40:38.910 --> 40:40.350]  But make 100 of these.
[40:40.470 --> 40:45.090]  And then I was going to put 50 just randomly inserted in some fuckface merch from the store.
[40:45.150 --> 40:45.670]  Oh, cool.
[40:45.830 --> 40:46.810]  Just slide it in the bag.
[40:46.990 --> 40:49.710]  So if you get one, you get a chance at getting one.
[40:50.070 --> 40:52.090]  And then I was going to carry 50 around with me.
[40:52.170 --> 40:54.570]  So if anybody asks me about fuckface or whatever, I can be like, here, have a...
[40:54.570 --> 40:55.270]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[40:55.350 --> 40:56.830]  Those would be gone in the first hour of the first day.
[40:56.910 --> 40:57.110]  Yeah.
[40:57.110 --> 40:57.430]  That's pretty exciting.
[40:57.430 --> 40:59.910]  So I'm going to make 100 and then give them away.
[40:59.910 --> 41:02.370]  You might want to consider making more if you're going to just carry them around and
[41:02.370 --> 41:02.750]  hand them out.
[41:02.770 --> 41:04.350]  Well, as you've seen, it's a whole process.
[41:07.290 --> 41:08.670]  This is really cool.
[41:09.170 --> 41:09.810]  This is...
[41:09.810 --> 41:13.910]  This show is innovative in a way that you would never expect.
[41:14.670 --> 41:14.950]  Yeah.
[41:15.130 --> 41:15.790]  No, I agree.
[41:15.950 --> 41:16.490]  I totally agree.
[41:16.770 --> 41:17.290]  You know why?
[41:17.710 --> 41:18.390]  We did it.
[41:18.890 --> 41:21.950]  It's because I kept looking at cards that are numbered and going like, I could do that,
[41:21.990 --> 41:22.170]  right?
[41:22.330 --> 41:22.430]  Yeah.
[41:22.510 --> 41:23.250]  I could figure that out.
[41:23.350 --> 41:23.830]  And so we did.
[41:23.910 --> 41:25.630]  So now there's an Ian all over a Tim Conway.
[41:25.790 --> 41:25.950]  Yeah.
[41:25.970 --> 41:27.110]  So now there's a Tim Conway Ian.
[41:27.110 --> 41:27.910]  That's very cool.
[41:28.390 --> 41:29.070]  It looks great.
[41:29.170 --> 41:29.410]  Yeah.
[41:29.590 --> 41:30.390]  It's really good.
[41:30.470 --> 41:30.710]  Yeah.
[41:31.610 --> 41:32.250]  And yeah.
[41:32.390 --> 41:32.930]  So there you go.
[41:33.590 --> 41:34.950]  What an insane thing that we have.
[41:35.010 --> 41:36.850]  Hit me up at RTX if you see me and ask me for one.
[41:36.990 --> 41:39.210]  And I'm sure I'm going to get sick of that real fucking fast.
[41:39.230 --> 41:39.470]  Yeah.
[41:39.470 --> 41:41.350]  You really did yourself in on that one.
[41:42.070 --> 41:43.570]  Here's a little bit of homework for myself.
[41:43.810 --> 41:44.190]  You dummy.
[41:44.350 --> 41:44.730]  Here's what I'll do.
[41:44.870 --> 41:45.930]  So I bought this...
[41:45.930 --> 41:48.270]  I got this box of 89 FLIR update.
[41:48.410 --> 41:48.530]  Yeah.
[41:48.710 --> 41:49.230]  And so it's...
[41:49.230 --> 41:50.730]  I thought it had Billy Ripkins in it, but it doesn't.
[41:50.850 --> 41:50.970]  Ah.
[41:51.130 --> 41:53.110]  So it's numbered 1 to 132.
[41:54.490 --> 41:55.410]  I'll just do them all.
[41:55.850 --> 41:56.450]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[41:56.450 --> 41:57.830]  So then they'll be sequentially numbered.
[41:58.310 --> 41:59.090]  And then you have a whole...
[41:59.090 --> 41:59.450]  And it'll all be from the same set.
[41:59.490 --> 41:59.810]  The whole set.
[42:00.090 --> 42:00.670]  That's very cool.
[42:00.890 --> 42:01.490]  So that'll be fun.
[42:01.570 --> 42:02.090]  I like that.
[42:02.310 --> 42:02.710]  Yeah, thanks.
[42:02.830 --> 42:03.490]  That's a good idea.
[42:03.830 --> 42:04.890]  So there was that.
[42:05.770 --> 42:06.750]  RTX is going to be fun.
[42:06.990 --> 42:07.550]  You know what we should do?
[42:07.670 --> 42:08.070]  Yeah, what's that?
[42:08.110 --> 42:10.790]  Let's open up some old...
[42:10.790 --> 42:11.510]  I found this box.
[42:11.550 --> 42:12.950]  I was cleaning out all the fuckface stuff.
[42:13.030 --> 42:13.410]  Oh, cool.
[42:13.450 --> 42:16.810]  And I forgot I bought a bunch of Zimmable Facebooks.
[42:16.810 --> 42:17.170]  That's awesome.
[42:17.230 --> 42:17.970]  How many go in the pack sack?
[42:18.910 --> 42:19.130]  One.
[42:19.530 --> 42:19.850]  Fantastic.
[42:20.330 --> 42:20.650]  Goddammit.
[42:21.230 --> 42:21.550]  Okay.
[42:21.810 --> 42:25.090]  Let's open up two packs of 1990 tops.
[42:25.490 --> 42:26.130]  1990 tops.
[42:26.130 --> 42:28.950]  Obviously, we're looking for Don Zimmer to a lesser extent.
[42:29.110 --> 42:33.270]  Probably Ken Griffey Jr. is not in there.
[42:34.810 --> 42:36.830]  Don Mattingly, Wade Boggs, Roger Clemens.
[42:37.050 --> 42:37.450]  I guess.
[42:38.250 --> 42:39.090]  Martin McGuire.
[42:39.290 --> 42:42.550]  I mean, Clemens had been in the league for, what, five years?
[42:43.150 --> 42:45.430]  Cal Ripken and Nolan Ryan.
[42:45.530 --> 42:45.850]  They're perennial.
[42:46.970 --> 42:48.010]  Dan Bilzerian.
[42:48.110 --> 42:48.330]  Cool.
[42:48.970 --> 42:50.010]  Bernie Williams.
[42:50.250 --> 42:50.850]  Mm-hmm.
[42:50.970 --> 42:52.330]  Brett Bilevin.
[42:52.870 --> 42:53.610]  Kurt Wilkerson.
[42:53.890 --> 42:54.430]  Bert Bile...
[42:54.430 --> 42:55.090]  It doesn't matter.
[42:55.690 --> 42:56.810]  It doesn't matter.
[42:56.890 --> 42:57.130]  Keep going.
[42:57.350 --> 42:58.090]  Bob Welch.
[42:58.650 --> 42:59.170]  Ooh.
[43:00.230 --> 43:01.890]  A. Bartlett Giamatti.
[43:02.350 --> 43:02.690]  What?
[43:02.970 --> 43:03.570]  Hang on.
[43:03.770 --> 43:05.470]  This looks like a card from now.
[43:05.970 --> 43:09.430]  That looks like a photo in 2022 of just a man.
[43:09.630 --> 43:09.830]  Yeah.
[43:10.030 --> 43:11.030]  Who is that?
[43:11.370 --> 43:15.590]  He was the president of... he was the commissioner of Major League Baseball.
[43:16.170 --> 43:16.690]  Oh.
[43:16.850 --> 43:19.630]  From 489 to 989.
[43:20.750 --> 43:22.030]  Oh, then he died.
[43:22.030 --> 43:25.690]  He was only commissioner for fucking five months, then he died.
[43:25.810 --> 43:26.390]  That sucks.
[43:26.510 --> 43:27.370]  Got a nice card, though.
[43:27.630 --> 43:28.810]  Joel Skinner.
[43:29.190 --> 43:30.070]  Jesus Christ.
[43:30.090 --> 43:32.590]  John Farrell, I worked with at the call center.
[43:32.810 --> 43:33.250]  What?
[43:33.250 --> 43:33.750]  Different guy.
[43:33.970 --> 43:34.390]  Same name.
[43:34.770 --> 43:35.530]  Lenny Dykstra.
[43:35.850 --> 43:36.190]  Nails.
[43:36.450 --> 43:37.270]  There's nails.
[43:37.690 --> 43:39.670]  Yeah, this is... you're not gonna keep that one?
[43:39.990 --> 43:40.410]  Yeah.
[43:40.470 --> 43:40.730]  Yeah.
[43:41.030 --> 43:42.190]  You gotta keep nails.
[43:42.610 --> 43:48.350]  If you don't know anything about Lenny Dykstra, there's a Google rabbit hole you can go down for a long time.
[43:48.690 --> 43:49.590]  Holy shit.
[43:49.890 --> 43:50.730]  Legit maniac.
[43:51.330 --> 43:51.810]  Maniac.
[43:51.810 --> 43:51.850]  Legit maniac.
[43:51.930 --> 43:53.190]  Probably in jail right now, I would imagine.
[43:53.430 --> 43:53.790]  Oh, do you remember when...
[43:53.790 --> 43:54.890]  Or living in somebody's mansion.
[43:54.950 --> 43:58.410]  When he was talking about, like, I've been arrested in, like, six months.
[43:58.430 --> 43:59.670]  And it's like, great.
[44:00.510 --> 44:00.810]  Ugh.
[44:01.770 --> 44:02.450]  Just, ugh.
[44:02.810 --> 44:03.150]  Monster.
[44:03.310 --> 44:03.810]  J-PAL.
[44:03.890 --> 44:04.170]  Alright.
[44:05.050 --> 44:06.650]  Uh, Craig McMurtry.
[44:07.730 --> 44:08.410]  Todd Benzinger.
[44:08.630 --> 44:08.830]  What's up?
[44:09.410 --> 44:11.710]  Wait, wait, can we go back to... is he wearing glasses?
[44:12.130 --> 44:12.550]  Yeah, dude.
[44:12.670 --> 44:13.610]  Is he a substitute teacher?
[44:14.510 --> 44:15.650]  You gotta see with a ball.
[44:15.690 --> 44:16.130]  You gotta see the ball.
[44:17.750 --> 44:19.390]  Imagine if there was a player that...
[44:19.390 --> 44:21.110]  Yeah, a player that dresses like that now.
[44:21.250 --> 44:21.730]  That'd suck.
[44:22.690 --> 44:23.770]  Todd Benzinger.
[44:24.870 --> 44:25.950]  Spike Jones.
[44:27.690 --> 44:28.530]  Tony Pena.
[44:29.670 --> 44:30.570]  Rick Rudin.
[44:31.150 --> 44:31.970]  Love this producing.
[44:32.710 --> 44:33.790]  Jay Howell.
[44:35.250 --> 44:36.430]  So nothing good.
[44:36.530 --> 44:36.850]  No.
[44:37.170 --> 44:37.390]  Cool.
[44:37.530 --> 44:38.170]  Maybe this pack, though.
[44:38.290 --> 44:38.450]  Alright.
[44:38.450 --> 44:39.530]  They're in remarkably good shape.
[44:39.630 --> 44:39.990]  They are.
[44:40.270 --> 44:42.370]  They're not really sealed very well, but...
[44:42.370 --> 44:42.830]  There's gum.
[44:42.990 --> 44:43.550]  Anyone want gum?
[44:43.910 --> 44:45.270]  The 90s was a safer time.
[44:47.730 --> 44:48.810]  Kurt Schilling.
[44:50.150 --> 44:50.690]  Wow.
[44:50.690 --> 44:51.250]  Yeah.
[44:52.550 --> 44:54.370]  I don't remember him as an Oriole.
[44:54.710 --> 44:55.130]  I don't either.
[44:55.290 --> 44:57.030]  I saw him in a commercial recently, I think.
[44:57.670 --> 44:58.390]  Lee Mazzilli.
[44:58.610 --> 44:59.430]  Was it for MyPillow?
[45:02.750 --> 45:04.010]  He did go that way, didn't he?
[45:04.710 --> 45:05.830]  I forgot about that.
[45:05.890 --> 45:07.110]  I was just wondering where you saw him in a commercial.
[45:08.810 --> 45:09.530]  Jose Guzman.
[45:11.110 --> 45:11.830]  Nick Laieva.
[45:12.670 --> 45:13.390]  Randy Velarde.
[45:14.250 --> 45:14.890]  Otis Nixon.
[45:14.990 --> 45:15.650]  I always liked Otis Nixon.
[45:16.650 --> 45:17.010]  Rich Gedman.
[45:17.010 --> 45:18.310]  I love those Expos jerseys, too.
[45:18.510 --> 45:19.670]  Expos jerseys were so nice.
[45:19.670 --> 45:20.670]  Tom Glavin.
[45:21.430 --> 45:22.270]  Ken Caminiti.
[45:23.570 --> 45:24.410]  Rob Beer.
[45:25.050 --> 45:25.810]  Fucking mullet.
[45:26.090 --> 45:26.510]  Beautiful.
[45:27.550 --> 45:28.290]  Ooh, Bobby Bonilla.
[45:29.490 --> 45:31.170]  Aren't the Mets still paying him?
[45:32.130 --> 45:33.030]  Oh, that's him, huh?
[45:33.170 --> 45:33.370]  Yeah.
[45:33.470 --> 45:34.970]  Yeah, he gets paid like once a year.
[45:35.370 --> 45:36.550]  Like, it's Bobby Bonilla Day.
[45:36.710 --> 45:36.950]  Yeah.
[45:37.150 --> 45:38.270]  When is Bobby Bonilla Day?
[45:38.270 --> 45:40.030]  It's for like 25 years or something.
[45:40.110 --> 45:40.330]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45:40.330 --> 45:41.330]  He's been retired...
[45:41.330 --> 45:41.590]  Fuck.
[45:41.710 --> 45:42.690]  Probably since like, 96.
[45:42.910 --> 45:43.110]  Yep.
[45:44.270 --> 45:45.070]  Terry Kennedy.
[45:45.890 --> 45:46.910]  Randy St. Clair.
[45:47.730 --> 45:48.570]  Roger Craig.
[45:48.570 --> 45:49.250]  Roger Craig has a manager card.
[45:50.850 --> 45:51.290]  Uh...
[45:51.290 --> 45:52.170]  Bob Darnier.
[45:53.030 --> 45:54.370]  And Harold Reynolds.
[45:54.550 --> 45:55.690]  Back in the fucking...
[45:55.690 --> 45:56.370]  July.
[45:56.550 --> 45:57.910]  We're coming up on Bobby Bonilla Day.
[45:58.010 --> 45:58.970]  July 1st.
[45:58.990 --> 45:59.490]  What's he gonna get?
[45:59.490 --> 46:00.150]  Is Bobby Bonilla Day.
[46:00.830 --> 46:07.290]  The Mets still owe the former All-Star $1.19 million a year until he's 72.
[46:08.630 --> 46:09.530]  Imagine, get it?
[46:09.550 --> 46:13.170]  You don't have to do shit and you just got a million dollars coming your way.
[46:13.690 --> 46:14.390]  That's awesome.
[46:14.730 --> 46:15.170]  Isn't that cool?
[46:15.610 --> 46:16.530]  I wanna be Bobby Bonilla.
[46:17.310 --> 46:17.710]  Damn.
[46:18.210 --> 46:19.450]  Bobby Bonilla Day rules.
[46:20.230 --> 46:20.990]  Oh, you know what?
[46:21.050 --> 46:22.910]  I have a little special present for you, Eric.
[46:23.170 --> 46:24.490]  A special present for me?
[46:24.710 --> 46:25.470]  Not a present, but a surprise.
[46:25.570 --> 46:26.430]  A fun thing for us to open.
[46:26.750 --> 46:26.850]  Okay.
[46:27.490 --> 46:29.250]  I know I always hit you with the wrestling.
[46:29.410 --> 46:29.590]  Yeah.
[46:29.870 --> 46:33.090]  But I also have for you a little Umbrella Academy.
[46:33.390 --> 46:33.790]  No!
[46:34.250 --> 46:34.450]  Yeah!
[46:34.670 --> 46:35.430]  Yeah, we still have some.
[46:35.550 --> 46:35.630]  No!
[46:36.490 --> 46:37.770]  I don't know how much you missed it.
[46:37.910 --> 46:38.890]  We're talking about it.
[46:38.890 --> 46:39.710]  These are the...
[46:39.710 --> 46:40.650]  I thought...
[46:40.650 --> 46:41.830]  There's so many...
[46:41.830 --> 46:43.210]  There's so many packs left.
[46:43.270 --> 46:43.770]  So many.
[46:43.770 --> 46:44.770]  I'll put one in the pack sack.
[46:45.550 --> 46:45.950]  Why?!
[46:45.950 --> 46:48.190]  You said I gotta.
[46:48.490 --> 46:49.930]  I hate these cards.
[46:50.110 --> 46:50.990]  They are...
[46:50.990 --> 46:54.010]  These are the bane of doing this show.
[46:54.150 --> 46:56.350]  Rebecca always begs me to open these.
[46:56.590 --> 46:59.710]  So I decided today we're gonna make her and you happy.
[46:59.730 --> 47:02.270]  We're gonna see the same ones we've already seen.
[47:02.430 --> 47:04.990]  We can only hope.
[47:05.470 --> 47:06.170]  For what?!
[47:07.230 --> 47:08.990]  For Run, boy, Run.
[47:09.070 --> 47:09.810]  We've seen that one?
[47:10.110 --> 47:10.550]  Yeah, we have.
[47:10.690 --> 47:10.870]  Yup.
[47:11.370 --> 47:11.930]  Is that the right... yeah.
[47:13.350 --> 47:14.310]  How about...
[47:14.310 --> 47:16.150]  Oh, yeah, we definitely saw Man on the Moon before.
[47:16.750 --> 47:17.350]  Oh, shit!
[47:17.470 --> 47:21.010]  But have we seen an on-card auto of Justin Nim?
[47:21.290 --> 47:21.510]  Min?
[47:21.710 --> 47:22.190]  Justin Min?
[47:22.530 --> 47:23.250]  It's upside down!
[47:23.990 --> 47:25.130]  It's Nim upside down.
[47:26.190 --> 47:27.230]  That's fucking cool.
[47:28.270 --> 47:28.610]  Is it?
[47:28.790 --> 47:29.750]  Yeah, he's Ben Hargraves.
[47:29.830 --> 47:30.510]  He's one of the main characters.
[47:31.470 --> 47:31.650]  Great.
[47:31.990 --> 47:32.830]  Oh, Man on the Moon.
[47:33.130 --> 47:33.810]  We say that a lot.
[47:35.050 --> 47:35.410]  And...
[47:35.410 --> 47:36.470]  The day that was...
[47:36.470 --> 47:38.610]  Dude, I need to sleeve that auto pretty soon.
[47:38.650 --> 47:39.530]  That's fucking cool.
[47:39.690 --> 47:41.610]  Yeah, it's gonna be worth a dollar pretty soon, man.
[47:41.670 --> 47:42.250]  It's gonna be nuts.
[47:44.310 --> 47:45.970]  You know, new season coming out soon.
[47:46.230 --> 47:47.190]  Are you serious?
[47:47.530 --> 47:47.670]  Yeah.
[47:47.830 --> 47:48.410]  You're doing more?
[47:48.590 --> 47:48.790]  Yes.
[47:48.790 --> 47:49.250]  Oh, hell yeah.
[47:49.450 --> 47:49.890]  Oh, man.
[47:50.790 --> 47:51.110]  Alright.
[47:52.590 --> 47:53.090]  Oh, no.
[47:55.270 --> 47:56.190]  Open, fucker.
[47:59.710 --> 48:01.850]  We only see each other at weddings and funerals.
[48:02.650 --> 48:04.050]  The day that wasn't.
[48:04.910 --> 48:06.550]  Also, the day that wasn't.
[48:06.630 --> 48:07.670]  These cards suck.
[48:07.810 --> 48:07.970]  Ooh!
[48:08.410 --> 48:09.250]  The day that was.
[48:13.870 --> 48:14.190]  And...
[48:14.190 --> 48:14.970]  Extra ordinary.
[48:15.850 --> 48:16.750]  These cards are...
[48:16.750 --> 48:17.610]  Are we done with these yet?
[48:17.790 --> 48:18.330]  Extremely ordinary.
[48:18.690 --> 48:20.530]  I put it away already, so you don't have to look at it again for a while.
[48:20.610 --> 48:21.030]  Thank God.
[48:22.570 --> 48:23.530]  What do you want to tuck into?
[48:24.090 --> 48:25.030]  Should we fuck with some football?
[48:25.170 --> 48:25.730]  Let's do it.
[48:28.590 --> 48:29.450]  Who's your football team?
[48:30.430 --> 48:31.190]  I don't really have one.
[48:31.250 --> 48:31.890]  Yeah, me neither.
[48:33.010 --> 48:37.130]  I mean, I had Alabama for college, but when I was a kid, the closest thing was the Saints,
[48:37.170 --> 48:39.010]  and the Saints were dog shit my entire childhood.
[48:39.170 --> 48:39.230]  Yeah.
[48:39.230 --> 48:39.390]  Yeah.
[48:39.750 --> 48:42.310]  Not fun to root for at all in any way, so...
[48:42.310 --> 48:42.350]  No.
[48:42.350 --> 48:42.430]  No.
[48:42.430 --> 48:43.470]  Teddy Bridgewater...
[48:43.470 --> 48:43.590]  Right.
[48:44.370 --> 48:45.010]  Ryan Tannehill...
[48:45.010 --> 48:47.050]  You don't have the, uh...
[48:47.050 --> 48:47.430]  The who?
[48:48.850 --> 48:49.350]  The Rams?
[48:49.750 --> 48:50.070]  No.
[48:50.750 --> 48:52.930]  I guess that's probably the closest team that I would root for.
[48:53.010 --> 48:53.510]  Phillip Lindsey?
[48:54.150 --> 48:55.850]  Just so they can stick it to the Chargers every year.
[48:55.970 --> 48:56.290]  That's fine.
[48:56.390 --> 48:56.610]  Tyler Taylor.
[48:56.730 --> 48:57.270]  Oh, yeah.
[48:57.650 --> 48:58.590]  You can do the Chargers.
[48:58.590 --> 48:58.970]  Uh-huh.
[48:59.070 --> 49:01.070]  No, I don't think I ever will until they move back.
[49:01.290 --> 49:01.810]  Derek Carr.
[49:02.690 --> 49:05.490]  I felt like he used to play for the, uh...
[49:05.890 --> 49:08.870]  Houston in the early 2000s, but I guess that was Drew Carr.
[49:09.190 --> 49:09.950]  That was David.
[49:10.110 --> 49:10.350]  David Carr.
[49:10.350 --> 49:11.330]  Yeah, it's his brother, isn't it?
[49:11.470 --> 49:11.930]  Is it his brother?
[49:12.050 --> 49:12.210]  Yeah.
[49:12.350 --> 49:12.510]  Oh.
[49:13.250 --> 49:13.730]  There you go.
[49:13.950 --> 49:15.290]  That's why this feels like the same dude.
[49:16.370 --> 49:16.730]  Uh...
[49:16.730 --> 49:17.310]  Cam Newton.
[49:17.670 --> 49:18.310]  Is he still around?
[49:19.330 --> 49:19.690]  Yes?
[49:20.130 --> 49:21.590]  He's gotta be a backup to a backup somewhere.
[49:21.770 --> 49:22.710]  Making a paycheck.
[49:22.970 --> 49:23.930]  CeeDee Lamb.
[49:24.110 --> 49:24.410]  Oh.
[49:25.390 --> 49:25.750]  Uh...
[49:25.750 --> 49:26.710]  DeAndre Swift.
[49:29.870 --> 49:30.590]  Alvin Kamara.
[49:32.630 --> 49:33.550]  DeAndre Swift again.
[49:33.630 --> 49:34.050]  That's parallel.
[49:34.250 --> 49:35.570]  You don't have to read them upside down.
[49:35.810 --> 49:37.210]  Like, you can read them right side up.
[49:37.230 --> 49:37.550]  Alvin Kamara.
[49:37.550 --> 49:38.710]  You can just turn the whole...
[49:38.710 --> 49:39.110]  Oh, yeah.
[49:39.110 --> 49:39.790]  Yeah, I could do that, huh?
[49:40.770 --> 49:41.330]  Like, uh...
[49:41.330 --> 49:42.610]  Ramondre Stevenson rookie.
[49:42.730 --> 49:43.010]  Uh-huh.
[49:43.370 --> 49:44.730]  See how it's easier this way?
[49:44.830 --> 49:45.810]  Nick Chubb.
[49:46.010 --> 49:46.290]  Yeah!
[49:46.910 --> 49:48.370]  I gotta do a complicated flip.
[49:48.630 --> 49:48.730]  Uh-huh.
[49:48.770 --> 49:49.510]  Kellen Mond.
[49:49.710 --> 49:50.510]  You're doing great with it, though.
[49:50.670 --> 49:50.950]  Ooh.
[49:51.470 --> 49:52.570]  Ahsante Samuel Jr.
[49:54.490 --> 49:54.770]  Uh...
[49:54.770 --> 49:55.410]  He's wearing a hat?
[49:55.750 --> 49:56.210]  That's fun.
[49:56.350 --> 49:57.390]  Ramondre Stevenson.
[49:58.490 --> 49:59.050]  Ernest Jones.
[49:59.130 --> 49:59.690]  He's wearing a hat?
[49:59.770 --> 50:00.450]  I didn't even see his hat.
[50:01.570 --> 50:03.090]  It just, from over here, looks like he's wearing a hat.
[50:03.590 --> 50:04.270]  He is wearing a hat.
[50:04.450 --> 50:05.590]  It's like a little beret or something.
[50:06.130 --> 50:06.510]  I don't know.
[50:06.630 --> 50:07.030]  It's cute.
[50:07.110 --> 50:07.810]  He's doing a football beret?
[50:09.110 --> 50:09.990]  Tyson Campbell.
[50:10.370 --> 50:10.810]  Ooh.
[50:11.270 --> 50:11.430]  Ooh.
[50:11.690 --> 50:11.890]  Ooh.
[50:12.130 --> 50:12.190]  Ooh.
[50:12.190 --> 50:12.290]  Ooh.
[50:12.430 --> 50:12.650]  Awesome.
[50:12.930 --> 50:13.970]  See, it's hard because of the flip.
[50:14.230 --> 50:14.770]  Jalen Waddle.
[50:14.950 --> 50:15.590]  Alabama rookie.
[50:15.870 --> 50:16.550]  Oh, nice.
[50:16.710 --> 50:16.870]  Yeah.
[50:17.030 --> 50:17.350]  There we go.
[50:17.810 --> 50:19.450]  And then Quincy Roche.
[50:19.650 --> 50:20.050]  Roche.
[50:21.030 --> 50:21.470]  Roche.
[50:22.210 --> 50:22.610]  Roche.
[50:22.830 --> 50:23.010]  Roche.
[50:23.450 --> 50:26.050]  Not very exciting to do football cards when it's not football season, huh?
[50:26.390 --> 50:26.730]  Yeah.
[50:27.350 --> 50:28.450]  It's not exciting at all.
[50:28.770 --> 50:28.930]  Uh-uh.
[50:30.230 --> 50:30.630]  All right.
[50:30.650 --> 50:31.890]  We'll put those...
[50:32.850 --> 50:33.290]  And...
[50:33.290 --> 50:35.210]  We could now...
[50:35.210 --> 50:35.590]  Uh-huh.
[50:35.590 --> 50:37.230]  We have more mail.
[50:37.430 --> 50:38.990]  We have packs of stuff.
[50:39.170 --> 50:39.530]  Let's do more mail.
[50:39.650 --> 50:42.270]  You have to open it with this, and you have to be careful to not show an address.
[50:42.470 --> 50:42.770]  There you go.
[50:42.770 --> 50:42.950]  See?
[50:43.450 --> 50:44.190]  See how you're doing?
[50:44.190 --> 50:44.570]  You're doing great.
[50:44.950 --> 50:45.310]  Okay.
[50:45.370 --> 50:45.650]  All right.
[50:45.650 --> 50:45.910]  All right.
[50:45.990 --> 50:46.210]  Okay.
[50:46.390 --> 50:47.170]  Jesus Christ.
[50:48.090 --> 50:49.070]  There will be blood.
[50:49.350 --> 50:49.590]  Oh!
[50:49.850 --> 50:50.210]  Awesome.
[50:50.790 --> 50:53.710]  And now we just have to let it soak a little bit, and then I think we got this.
[50:55.090 --> 50:55.970]  Oh, this is exciting.
[50:56.610 --> 50:57.090]  Has it?
[50:57.150 --> 50:57.330]  Okay.
[50:57.370 --> 50:57.550]  Cool.
[50:58.550 --> 50:58.870]  Oh!
[50:59.150 --> 50:59.970]  This is way more...
[50:59.970 --> 51:00.690]  It's soaked in.
[51:00.770 --> 51:01.330]  Good job!
[51:02.110 --> 51:02.470]  See?
[51:04.470 --> 51:05.170]  What are you looking at?
[51:05.170 --> 51:07.630]  I'm sure it's not going to bite me.
[51:09.110 --> 51:10.830]  Okay, let's see what we got here.
[51:11.730 --> 51:13.650]  This is from...
[51:14.110 --> 51:15.470]  Well, I can't really see the name anymore.
[51:17.050 --> 51:18.410]  I want to say it's Liz.
[51:21.530 --> 51:22.330]  That'll be a note.
[51:23.350 --> 51:24.670]  He just tore it apart.
[51:24.930 --> 51:26.450]  Who the fuck sent this?
[51:29.590 --> 51:29.890]  Mm-hmm.
[51:32.210 --> 51:32.570]  Uh-huh.
[51:32.790 --> 51:32.970]  Liv.
[51:33.770 --> 51:34.450]  Liv said,
[51:34.550 --> 51:36.510]  Dear Geoff, Gavin, Andrew, Eric, and Nick,
[51:36.690 --> 51:38.130]  I recently stumbled upon...
[51:38.130 --> 51:40.670]  By the way, if you ever send us something and you don't want us to read the letter out loud,
[51:41.130 --> 51:42.470]  the first sentence should be,
[51:42.890 --> 51:44.490]  Hey guys, don't read this out loud.
[51:44.510 --> 51:47.950]  Before it says, dear whoever, at the top, say, don't read this out loud.
[51:48.230 --> 51:50.310]  I recently stumbled upon this and thought you should have it.
[51:50.410 --> 51:51.130]  I love listening to...
[51:52.610 --> 51:54.970]  ...face every week and just wanted to...
[51:54.970 --> 51:55.610]  That was a good one.
[51:55.750 --> 51:56.450]  That was... yeah, yeah, yeah.
[51:56.450 --> 51:58.870]  Thank you all for bringing a bit of laughter into my life.
[51:59.070 --> 52:00.070]  Well, you're welcome.
[52:00.410 --> 52:01.490]  Thank you for the nice note.
[52:04.890 --> 52:05.730]  Got rid of that.
[52:06.770 --> 52:08.990]  PS also made some ugly little bracelets for you.
[52:09.090 --> 52:09.830]  I think they're not ugly.
[52:10.190 --> 52:11.210]  The beads change color in sunlight.
[52:11.370 --> 52:11.850]  No shit.
[52:11.950 --> 52:12.390]  Oh, cool.
[52:12.570 --> 52:12.890]  That's cool.
[52:13.230 --> 52:14.930]  Oh, red and pink is Eric, obviously.
[52:15.430 --> 52:16.310]  Orange is Andrew.
[52:17.090 --> 52:18.170]  Yellow is Geoff.
[52:19.350 --> 52:19.830]  Yellow is Geoff.
[52:19.830 --> 52:21.110]  I think yellow should be Andrew, right?
[52:21.110 --> 52:21.790]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[52:21.850 --> 52:22.710]  Because it's like you're an obsession.
[52:22.710 --> 52:23.770]  Yeah, he's like a piss boy.
[52:23.910 --> 52:24.250]  He's like a piss boy.
[52:24.290 --> 52:24.690]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[52:25.390 --> 52:26.210]  But I'll take yellow.
[52:26.390 --> 52:27.290]  I like bananas.
[52:27.530 --> 52:27.930]  There you go.
[52:28.150 --> 52:28.770]  I like bananas a lot.
[52:28.890 --> 52:30.170]  I threw away three bananas today.
[52:30.290 --> 52:31.970]  Green is...
[52:31.970 --> 52:32.930]  Green is super fan, Jack.
[52:32.990 --> 52:33.910]  You could have made banana bread out of that.
[52:34.150 --> 52:36.070]  Blue is Gavin, and purple is Nick.
[52:36.430 --> 52:37.450]  You don't have to wear them.
[52:38.670 --> 52:39.550]  I'm just gonna wear them.
[52:40.670 --> 52:41.930]  Don't tell us not to wear them.
[52:42.090 --> 52:42.210]  Yeah.
[52:42.770 --> 52:43.870]  Let's see what this is.

[52:51.010 --> 52:52.310]  What is it?
[52:52.510 --> 52:52.710]  Live Sinus.
[52:52.850 --> 52:53.450]  Live Sinus.
[52:53.490 --> 52:54.410]  I'm gonna take it out of the bag.
[52:54.590 --> 52:54.810]  Oh.
[52:55.030 --> 52:58.950]  Live Sinus, an officially autographed Don Zimmer baseball.
[52:59.050 --> 53:00.070]  No way!
[53:00.810 --> 53:01.070]  Yeah.
[53:01.070 --> 53:03.110]  Oh, that's awesome!
[53:03.750 --> 53:04.950]  Look, authentic memories right here.
[53:05.030 --> 53:07.230]  Don Zimmer signed an official American League baseball.
[53:08.690 --> 53:09.890]  No way!
[53:10.530 --> 53:11.790]  Dude, are you serious?
[53:13.250 --> 53:15.190]  Oh, that's so cool!
[53:15.590 --> 53:19.130]  That baseball was in his pudgy little hands.
[53:19.730 --> 53:20.310]  Hold it up.
[53:23.290 --> 53:24.390]  Our hero.
[53:24.730 --> 53:25.270]  Wow!
[53:26.230 --> 53:27.530]  Hang on, there we go.
[53:28.730 --> 53:30.130]  Put it right up next to your face.
[53:31.070 --> 53:32.050]  Oh, that's a good one.
[53:32.970 --> 53:34.750]  Oh, we got some good content, baby!
[53:35.150 --> 53:37.470]  That's really a Don Zimmer signed baseball?
[53:37.590 --> 53:38.110]  It's really, it's official.
[53:38.610 --> 53:39.050]  Wow!
[53:39.290 --> 53:39.790]  I love it.
[53:40.890 --> 53:41.770]  Holy shit!
[53:41.870 --> 53:42.470]  That's my favorite thing.
[53:42.750 --> 53:43.670]  Uh, sorry, Millie.
[53:46.090 --> 53:47.330]  Dude, that is amazing.
[53:48.370 --> 53:49.910]  Oh my god, thank you, Liv.
[53:53.850 --> 53:55.290]  I'm... I'm floored.
[53:55.450 --> 53:57.210]  I'm floored by this.
[53:57.670 --> 53:59.710]  That's a... we... that's crazy!
[53:59.710 --> 54:01.230]  We're gonna have to take this outside to see what color it is.
[54:01.370 --> 54:02.130]  Oh yeah, that's... oh no!
[54:02.130 --> 54:06.010]  We'll put your bracelets on when we go outside because they're all the same color right now because they changed color outside.
[54:07.050 --> 54:08.090]  So we'll do it in a little bit.
[54:08.290 --> 54:08.930]  But thank you, Liv.
[54:09.330 --> 54:10.010]  Oh my god.
[54:10.310 --> 54:11.750]  I'm... I'm... I can't believe that.
[54:11.830 --> 54:12.170]  Blown away.
[54:14.090 --> 54:14.810]  Just blown away.
[54:15.990 --> 54:17.430]  The kindness and the generosity.
[54:17.790 --> 54:19.390]  We have a Don Zimmer baseball?
[54:19.630 --> 54:21.750]  Dude, we are officially in the Zim Zone.
[54:21.850 --> 54:23.030]  We got double Zim today.
[54:24.810 --> 54:26.590]  And... you can tell it's the same signature.
[54:26.590 --> 54:29.250]  Like, look at that.
[54:29.470 --> 54:30.710]  He probably can't see.
[54:31.310 --> 54:31.730]  Oh, wait!
[54:32.150 --> 54:32.670]  I'm getting there.
[54:33.430 --> 54:34.110]  There you go.
[54:34.690 --> 54:35.330]  Clearly.
[54:35.810 --> 54:36.850]  Look at his little face!
[54:37.450 --> 54:37.850]  Clearly.
[54:50.390 --> 54:51.670]  Is that...
[54:51.670 --> 54:54.710]  Is Don Zimmer coming to you to give you a kiss?
[54:56.170 --> 54:57.710]  Pucker up, buttercup!
[54:58.870 --> 55:00.330]  Welcome to the Zim Zone!
[55:01.490 --> 55:02.810]  Oh my god, that's...
[55:03.010 --> 55:04.430]  That's amazing. Two Zimmers today.
[55:04.930 --> 55:05.290]  That's...
[55:05.290 --> 55:05.910]  Got the Padres in them.
[55:06.030 --> 55:06.390]  Wow!
[55:06.890 --> 55:07.950]  What a phenomenal day.
[55:08.110 --> 55:09.090]  What a great day to be us.
[55:09.330 --> 55:10.170]  What? I...
[55:10.170 --> 55:12.310]  I'm so glad I'm not Gavin or Andrew or Emma.
[55:12.430 --> 55:12.790]  Oh!
[55:13.570 --> 55:13.890]  Oh!
[55:14.730 --> 55:15.090]  Ooh.
[55:17.490 --> 55:19.210]  Now I was thinking we could...
[55:19.210 --> 55:20.150]  Because I've been wanting to do this for a while.
[55:20.150 --> 55:22.530]  Because I still want to get the Hodor, Hodor card.
[55:22.650 --> 55:23.190]  Oh, that's right!
[55:23.430 --> 55:23.610]  Otto?
[55:24.470 --> 55:26.850]  Let's open up some Game of Thrones that I bought.
[55:26.850 --> 55:30.990]  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun!
[55:30.990 --> 55:31.750]  Is that the theme song?
[55:32.050 --> 55:33.210]  Yeah, you nailed it.
[55:33.530 --> 55:35.730]  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun!
[55:35.730 --> 55:39.710]  Somebody was trying to sing the Pirates of the Caribbean theme song the other day and that made me go like, oh.
[55:40.530 --> 55:41.110]  It's the same thing.
[55:41.490 --> 55:42.850]  We're gonna open...
[55:43.550 --> 55:45.490]  You save money if you just use the same song over and over.
[55:45.590 --> 55:45.830]  Yeah.
[55:48.850 --> 55:50.610]  We're gonna open this many. I put one in the pack sack.
[55:51.390 --> 55:52.370]  They're making a new show.
[55:52.850 --> 55:53.230]  Game of Thrones?
[55:53.510 --> 55:54.110]  Yeah, aren't they?
[55:54.110 --> 55:59.430]  Weren't they making like a prequel with Arya and then now they're making like a Jon Snow sequel?
[55:59.670 --> 56:01.410]  Yeah, I heard they're doing a Jon Snow thing.
[56:01.890 --> 56:06.530]  Talk about a series that has just lost all steam.
[56:06.610 --> 56:08.870]  People have not revisited Game of Thrones.
[56:10.090 --> 56:11.590]  King Tommen, everybody's favorite.
[56:11.670 --> 56:12.530]  Who the fuck?
[56:12.830 --> 56:14.970]  Who the fuck is that?
[56:15.210 --> 56:15.750]  King Tommen.
[56:16.810 --> 56:17.930]  Everybody loves King Tommen.
[56:19.930 --> 56:20.850]  There's a dragon.
[56:22.610 --> 56:23.570]  King Tommen.
[56:23.570 --> 56:28.050]  Do you remember, uh, Meera Reed?
[56:29.370 --> 56:31.570]  Was she the, um...
[56:32.470 --> 56:33.580]  Was she like...
[56:34.290 --> 56:36.050]  She's one of Bran's steadfast companions.
[56:36.330 --> 56:36.650]  Oh.
[56:37.750 --> 56:39.030]  Oh, Ser Brendan Tully.
[56:39.770 --> 56:40.230]  Oh!
[56:41.450 --> 56:43.030]  Oh, there's brother Lancel.
[56:43.890 --> 56:48.230]  This show. This fucking show, dude.
[56:48.490 --> 56:49.030]  Are these...
[56:49.030 --> 56:49.870]  Sansa Stark.
[56:49.870 --> 56:53.730]  If you bought these and they're like prank cards,
[56:54.290 --> 56:57.430]  I would have no... I would just assume, like, man, you got me.
[56:57.710 --> 57:01.350]  Like, they threw in a Sansa to be like, see, it's real.
[57:01.830 --> 57:02.130]  Yeah, right?
[57:02.510 --> 57:04.230]  But like, you just show...
[57:04.230 --> 57:08.190]  Like, what the fuck is this?
[57:08.210 --> 57:10.730]  We should make our own Game of Thrones cards.
[57:10.970 --> 57:11.590]  This is a good idea.
[57:11.830 --> 57:13.370]  Our own bootleg. Somebody write that down.
[57:13.550 --> 57:14.970]  This is insane looking.
[57:15.130 --> 57:17.130]  We're gonna make our own bootleg Game of Thrones cards.
[57:17.530 --> 57:19.090]  What season was the last? Season 8?
[57:19.090 --> 57:19.810]  7.
[57:20.430 --> 57:21.610]  We're gonna do season 11.
[57:21.750 --> 57:23.210]  Oh, wow. Oh, that's cool.
[57:23.450 --> 57:24.730]  There's, like, cards in it.
[57:25.770 --> 57:26.850]  Brother Rey.
[57:29.170 --> 57:32.550]  Wait, is that Ian McShane or whatever?
[57:32.870 --> 57:34.250]  What? He was in that show?
[57:34.390 --> 57:35.090]  Yeah, big time.
[57:36.530 --> 57:39.230]  Everybody be aware of the winds of winter.
[57:39.710 --> 57:40.530]  They're breezy.
[57:41.530 --> 57:42.070]  Chilly.
[57:42.710 --> 57:44.110]  There's Randall Tarly.
[57:46.790 --> 57:47.870]  Here is...
[57:47.870 --> 57:49.390]  Oh, Oathbreaker.
[57:50.110 --> 57:52.110]  I guess it's just because it's Jaime Lannister.
[57:52.430 --> 57:54.730]  I don't see the sword. Is there a sword in the shot?
[57:54.950 --> 57:56.250]  I don't see the sword.
[57:56.530 --> 57:57.710]  Oh, here's the Night King.
[57:59.990 --> 58:02.350]  The last two cards are from the show.
[58:02.510 --> 58:02.730]  Yes.
[58:02.790 --> 58:04.590]  The other ones, I'm not so sure.
[58:05.530 --> 58:06.550]  That one's from the show.
[58:06.850 --> 58:07.450]  Oh, here we go.
[58:08.030 --> 58:09.650]  Podrick Payne. Remember him.
[58:10.250 --> 58:11.750]  Oh, he was the blacksmith kid.
[58:12.130 --> 58:14.690]  Daenerys Targaryen. He was the illegitimate kid.
[58:14.810 --> 58:15.210]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[58:17.870 --> 58:21.010]  Well, this is cool. Like a Game of Thrones...
[58:21.850 --> 58:22.970]  ...heart card.
[58:24.830 --> 58:26.450]  It's one eye.
[58:27.490 --> 58:28.290]  Is that Missandei?
[58:28.750 --> 58:29.150]  Yeah.
[58:29.430 --> 58:30.230]  Yeah, that must be it.
[58:31.930 --> 58:33.170]  Is it? Let's see.
[58:34.710 --> 58:38.690]  It just says, weak men will never rule Dorne again.
[58:39.210 --> 58:40.310]  But we're not men yet.
[58:41.050 --> 58:44.070]  No, that's the three girls.
[58:44.570 --> 58:45.970]  That's the three girls!
[58:46.090 --> 58:46.810]  Everybody hated them.
[58:47.870 --> 58:48.970]  The Sand Vipers or whatever?
[58:49.190 --> 58:50.170]  I don't fucking know!
[58:50.790 --> 58:51.230]  Sand Snakes.
[58:52.130 --> 58:53.010]  Sand Snakes!
[58:53.190 --> 58:55.070]  Grandmeister Pacel. Take a shower.
[58:56.290 --> 58:56.990]  Oh, here we go.
[58:57.930 --> 58:58.490]  No one.
[59:00.090 --> 59:00.810]  That's what it says.
[59:02.410 --> 59:03.050]  Oh, no.
[59:07.350 --> 59:07.790]  That's...
[59:07.790 --> 59:09.750]  These cards can't be real.
[59:09.830 --> 59:10.970]  That's Lady Ginlock right there.
[59:11.110 --> 59:12.250]  He's insane. Oh, yeah, that's right.
[59:12.470 --> 59:12.590]  Yeah.
[59:13.950 --> 59:14.830]  Oh, here we go.
[59:14.930 --> 59:15.450]  Wander Franco.
[59:17.070 --> 59:18.390]  That's Walder Frey.
[59:18.910 --> 59:19.990]  What a piece of shit he was.
[59:20.250 --> 59:22.290]  There he is, shortstop for the race.
[59:22.550 --> 59:23.710]  Winter's windy again.
[59:25.310 --> 59:26.750]  Ooh, look at this.
[59:28.510 --> 59:28.690]  Yeah.
[59:29.050 --> 59:33.270]  Dario Naharis and Jorah Mormont sharing a moment.
[59:33.710 --> 59:34.870]  A more moment.
[59:36.510 --> 59:38.150]  Oh, here's Balen Greyjoy.
[59:38.710 --> 59:40.530]  Looking like he's in a prog rock band.
[59:40.770 --> 59:41.250]  Hell, yeah.
[59:41.730 --> 59:42.330]  All right.
[59:42.810 --> 59:44.090]  That's the guy who started Asia, right?
[59:44.090 --> 59:44.530]  Yeah.
[59:49.570 --> 59:51.870]  Aye, aye, aye.
[59:51.990 --> 59:56.050]  These might be my favorite cards we've ever opened,
[59:56.170 --> 59:58.330]  because I genuinely don't know...
[59:58.610 --> 59:59.210]  None of it.
[59:59.310 --> 01:00:01.850]  You probably ran to the TV every week to watch Game of Thrones.
[01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:04.850]  I watched it until the guy got his hand cut off,
[01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:06.270]  and then I went, I don't think I want to watch this anymore.
[01:00:06.490 --> 01:00:09.870]  And then watched some of it later and went, what the fuck?
[01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.870]  It's a baby.
[01:00:11.310 --> 01:00:11.630]  Great.
[01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:14.970]  Oh, here's Gregor Clegane.
[01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:16.390]  Okay, so I know about this guy.
[01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:17.310]  I know about that guy.
[01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:18.790]  Uh-oh, broken man.
[01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:21.910]  Uh-oh.
[01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:23.190]  Uh-oh.
[01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.790]  Uh-oh, hot dog.
[01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:24.990]  Jaqen H'ghar.
[01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.630]  He's the...
[01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:28.030]  Valor Morghulis guy.
[01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:29.550]  He's the face guy, right?
[01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:29.730]  Home.
[01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:32.650]  That's what it says.
[01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:35.730]  That's where the dragon lives, next to that campfire.
[01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:37.970]  Oh, he's a lizard.
[01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:38.630]  He's keeping warm.
[01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:38.930]  Yeah.
[01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:40.350]  He's a...
[01:00:40.350 --> 01:00:40.670]  Yeah.
[01:00:42.790 --> 01:00:43.150]  Oh!
[01:00:44.110 --> 01:00:44.470]  Eat.
[01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:46.230]  You got it, here it comes.
[01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:46.870]  What the fuck is this?
[01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:47.350]  No, you got it.
[01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:49.110]  I just don't recognize the wig.
[01:00:49.930 --> 01:00:50.290]  Izembaro.
[01:00:51.330 --> 01:00:51.910]  Oh, no.
[01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.890]  Like, that's not real.
[01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:53.450]  That's a hat.
[01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:55.030]  She's wearing a hat.
[01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.950]  Yeah, okay.
[01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:57.590]  It's a hair hat, man.
[01:00:59.350 --> 01:01:00.070]  Hey, check it out.
[01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:01.510]  Here's a fucking door.
[01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:02.690]  Why would you print the card?
[01:01:02.830 --> 01:01:03.310]  Why would you?
[01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:04.270]  You have all the...
[01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:04.790]  That's sad.
[01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:05.650]  I know, why would you?
[01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:06.590]  Tyrion Lannister.
[01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:07.370]  I remember him.
[01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:07.950]  Everybody loves him.
[01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:08.150]  Yeah.
[01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:09.970]  Young Eddard Stark.
[01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:12.210]  Eddard?
[01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.830]  Eddard.
[01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:14.090]  His name is Eddard?
[01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.490]  Eddard.
[01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.170]  Yeah.
[01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:16.490]  Eddard?
[01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:17.290]  That's why he fights.
[01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:17.890]  You gotta...
[01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:20.330]  Listen, you name a kid Eddard, he's gonna have to learn how to fight.
[01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:23.130]  And then everybody's favorite, Ramsay Bolton.
[01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:24.190]  He was a good guy.
[01:01:25.450 --> 01:01:26.070]  Everybody liked him.
[01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:26.910]  He's the dogs guy, yeah?
[01:01:27.110 --> 01:01:27.570]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:27.790]  Yeah.
[01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:29.790]  The flayed man.
[01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:30.110]  Yeah.
[01:01:30.330 --> 01:01:30.650]  Family.
[01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:31.370]  That was cool.
[01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:32.010]  Yeah.
[01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:32.970]  That part was cool.
[01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:33.290]  Bolton's, yeah.
[01:01:34.350 --> 01:01:35.690]  Okay, well that was some of that.
[01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:38.110]  What if we do a stamp?
[01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:39.610]  Let's try it.
[01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:40.570]  Let's see what happens.
[01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:42.750]  Let me get the Zim and the Coolio out of the way.
[01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:44.850]  Alright, let's get the...
[01:01:44.850 --> 01:01:46.290]  We're gonna try this.
[01:01:46.810 --> 01:01:48.210]  We're gonna see how it goes.
[01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:54.850]  I think that in order for this to get the best shot...
[01:01:54.850 --> 01:01:55.650]  Hang on.
[01:01:56.050 --> 01:01:56.950]  We gotta figure this out.
[01:01:57.030 --> 01:01:58.590]  Because I want this to look good on camera.
[01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:02.010]  So we might have to do a little bit of maneuvering.
[01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:02.850]  Brian, do you think that's alright?
[01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:03.650]  Or do you want us to do it up here?
[01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:04.970]  I'd do it on that.
[01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:05.790]  Do it on this thing?
[01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:06.090]  Cool.
[01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:06.750]  Soft surface.
[01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:07.370]  There you go.
[01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:08.570]  It's gonna be harder.
[01:02:09.070 --> 01:02:09.350]  That's good.
[01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:09.890]  Just push hard.
[01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:10.470]  You're strong.
[01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:11.030]  Big strong boy.
[01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.770]  Right?
[01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:13.350]  I am strong.
[01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:16.210]  Yeah, I am strong.
[01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:16.510]  Alright.
[01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:18.410]  This looks good for right here.
[01:02:18.490 --> 01:02:19.390]  You can see it's stamping down.
[01:02:19.450 --> 01:02:19.910]  Look at that.
[01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:20.610]  That looks good.
[01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:21.230]  Alright, here we go.
[01:02:21.290 --> 01:02:21.670]  Here we go.
[01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:24.170]  We are stamping down in the pad.
[01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:26.930]  This is the Vancouver Child Kicker official stamp.
[01:02:27.850 --> 01:02:28.330]  Press hard.
[01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:29.330]  You better press in that middle too.
[01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:30.430]  You better press, boy.
[01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:31.250]  There you go.
[01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:31.730]  There you go.
[01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:31.970]  See?
[01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:33.630]  Wait, wait.
[01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:34.110]  How does it look?
[01:02:34.810 --> 01:02:35.690]  Like, you gotta do it more.
[01:02:36.790 --> 01:02:38.490]  It takes up to three hours.
[01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:39.290]  Well, no.
[01:02:39.450 --> 01:02:41.010]  You have to get more ink on this thing.
[01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:43.010]  I understand, but it doesn't fucking fit.
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:46.960]  You try.
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.280]  This doesn't fit, guys.
[01:02:56.530 --> 01:02:57.150]  Hang on.
[01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:59.090]  You thought I was fucking done.
[01:02:59.570 --> 01:03:00.550]  I've only just begun.
[01:03:01.170 --> 01:03:02.130]  You son of a bitch.
[01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:04.990]  We got some.
[01:03:05.310 --> 01:03:05.570]  Alright.
[01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:06.210]  Let's try it.
[01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:06.990]  Alright, here we go.
[01:03:07.310 --> 01:03:08.110]  Official stamp.
[01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:11.350]  Okay.
[01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:12.130]  We're pressing.
[01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:12.850]  We're pressing.
[01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:15.390]  Vancouver Child Kicker.
[01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:16.710]  First official stamp.
[01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:20.450]  That looks great.
[01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:21.590]  That looks just like a real boot.
[01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:22.370]  That's really cool.
[01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.550]  Alright.
[01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:24.710]  Fifty bucks eBay right now.
[01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:25.750]  Oh my god, that worked.
[01:03:26.050 --> 01:03:27.130]  Dude, that's so cool.
[01:03:27.310 --> 01:03:30.810]  Alright, Geoff's gonna do a hundred of these and he's gonna carry them all around the convention center.
[01:03:30.830 --> 01:03:32.290]  Well, I think what we'll do is we'll have Andrew do them, right?
[01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:33.650]  He is the Vancouver Child Kicker.
[01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:34.570]  You're gonna...
[01:03:34.570 --> 01:03:35.750]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:37.430]  This...
[01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:39.170]  That worked out so well.
[01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:40.130]  This rules.
[01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:43.410]  I wanna make posters where we actually do the stamp.
[01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:44.690]  Wow.
[01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:47.030]  It worked out great.
[01:03:54.270 --> 01:03:55.270]  So fucking stupid.
[01:03:56.370 --> 01:03:57.270]  Everything we do.
[01:03:58.070 --> 01:03:58.790]  So dumb.
[01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:00.130]  I fucking love it.
[01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:01.490]  This show's crazy.
[01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:02.870]  Alright, let's...
[01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:04.490]  We've been going for over an hour, right?
[01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:05.130]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:05.530]  We got about...
[01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:06.710]  Let's say about 20 minutes left.
[01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:09.750]  Alright, let's do this box of NBA Illusions because I've been waiting to open these.
[01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:12.070]  So, how long have you had these and you've been waiting to open them?
[01:04:12.370 --> 01:04:12.970]  Since last year.
[01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:13.750]  What?
[01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:14.010]  I think.
[01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:15.350]  Or maybe early this year.
[01:04:15.490 --> 01:04:16.770]  Yeah, it's been months and months and months.
[01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:18.470]  Most of this stuff I've had...
[01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:20.510]  I bought this over a year ago, probably, that box.
[01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:21.950]  Then why aren't we opening it?
[01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:23.570]  I just forgot about them.
[01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:24.570]  I have them all like...
[01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:25.450]  They're in the center!
[01:04:26.110 --> 01:04:27.090]  Well, now they are.
[01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:28.610]  They were just in a...
[01:04:28.610 --> 01:04:35.750]  I had them all in the box, like in the big Tupperware tent, like bins, and then I organized it all and found a whole bunch of shit.
[01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:39.090]  Okay, so this is a box that you got and you've had for a little while.
[01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:39.390]  Yeah.
[01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:40.230]  How much is in the box?
[01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:44.330]  It is 10 packs per box, 6 cards per pack.
[01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:44.790]  Okay.
[01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:46.110]  This is NBA Illusions.
[01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:49.830]  I believe it is...
[01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:52.850]  Gonna be last year's rookies, probably.
[01:04:53.170 --> 01:04:53.470]  Alright.
[01:04:54.310 --> 01:04:55.490]  How many are going in the pack sack?
[01:04:57.790 --> 01:04:58.190]  Nice.
[01:04:58.410 --> 01:04:58.730]  Two.
[01:04:59.710 --> 01:05:00.510]  Then we'll open these.
[01:05:00.590 --> 01:05:00.930]  Got it.
[01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:03.150]  Then maybe one or two other randoms.
[01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:04.210]  Yeah, we got some stuff.
[01:05:04.210 --> 01:05:10.650]  Maybe hit that box of Heritage Baseball that I accidentally bought and spent way too much money on, because I thought I was buying Alan Ginter.
[01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:11.490]  Oh, come on.
[01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:12.690]  Sweet Lou Williams.
[01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:13.130]  Nice.
[01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:16.430]  Bobby Portis, I do not like.
[01:05:17.350 --> 01:05:19.250]  Here's a black parallel of DeAndre Ayton.
[01:05:19.610 --> 01:05:20.290]  Oh, that's cool.
[01:05:20.490 --> 01:05:23.810]  Yeah, he's probably not going to be a Phoenix Sun next year.
[01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:26.430]  Pascal Siakam.
[01:05:26.570 --> 01:05:27.030]  Hey, alright.
[01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:29.570]  He used to be a Celtic killer.
[01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:30.650]  He used to drive me crazy.
[01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:32.430]  Trey Jones, we figured him out, though.
[01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:34.670]  And then Jaden McDaniels, rookie.
[01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:36.330]  These cards are cool.
[01:05:36.810 --> 01:05:39.550]  Yeah, they're nice cards. I like them. I'm down with these cards.
[01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:41.650]  I'm a big fan of these cards.
[01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:44.170]  They're shiny.
[01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:46.750]  John Collins.
[01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:51.670]  Christaps Porzingis, the unicorn, as they call him.
[01:05:52.810 --> 01:05:54.910]  Probably because you see him on the court about as much as a unicorn.
[01:05:55.350 --> 01:05:58.230]  Patrick Williams, Instant Impact rookie. That's actually nice.
[01:05:58.310 --> 01:06:01.410]  I got a LaMelo Ball of this, numbered a 25.
[01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:02.830]  Wow, really? Damn.
[01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:07.290]  Evan Fournier in his brief stint as a useless Celtic.
[01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:13.970]  Oh, Christian Wood. I think he's probably not going to be a Rocket next year, either.
[01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:15.010]  Jordan Lora.
[01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:19.030]  I hope we pull an Al Horford.
[01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:24.510]  Eh, rookies. Yes, this would be a Oklahoma City Thunder Al Horford.
[01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:25.010]  Damn.
[01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:28.130]  Jamal Murray. I think he's still hurt. He'll hurt forever.
[01:06:28.410 --> 01:06:29.410]  OG Ananobi.
[01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:35.050]  I like Al Horford because I'm the same age as Al Horford, and he's playing in the NBA.
[01:06:35.930 --> 01:06:36.810]  That's insane.
[01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:38.510]  Tyler Hero, Black Parallel.
[01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:40.290]  I hate him, but that's a great looking card.
[01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:42.510]  Least favorite player in the NBA.
[01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.950]  100%.
[01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:44.410]  Joe Ingalls.
[01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:47.350]  Ooh, Desmond Bain.
[01:06:47.810 --> 01:06:50.010]  Boy, he turned out to be a hell of a fucking basketball player.
[01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:52.350]  Especially for a mid-first rounder.
[01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:54.030]  Isaiah Joe.
[01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:56.930]  I really like these cards.
[01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:58.950]  These are very cool.
[01:06:58.950 --> 01:07:00.550]  Have fun with them?
[01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:02.230]  Yeah, you know, enjoy them. Do whatever you do.
[01:07:03.070 --> 01:07:03.950]  They're for you, too.
[01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:05.130]  I'm good, I think I got it.
[01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:05.890]  Andre Drummond.
[01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:07.970]  Devin Booker.
[01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:10.490]  Serge Ibaka.
[01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.930]  Alright.
[01:07:11.970 --> 01:07:14.150]  He was in an Action Bronson song once.
[01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:15.010]  Hell yeah.
[01:07:15.330 --> 01:07:16.430]  CJ McCollum.
[01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:19.350]  Nikola Jokic.
[01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:20.670]  MVP there.
[01:07:21.090 --> 01:07:22.590]  And then Devin Vassell.
[01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:25.790]  Who is pretty good, but playing for San Antonio.
[01:07:26.070 --> 01:07:26.350]  Sorry, Nick.
[01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:27.250]  Ouch.
[01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:28.790]  He left.
[01:07:29.070 --> 01:07:29.390]  Oh, good.
[01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:33.350]  As I was saying that, I was like, alright, he's a fucking nigger.
[01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:34.890]  Can you believe he's a Spurs?
[01:07:35.090 --> 01:07:35.330]  I know.
[01:07:35.490 --> 01:07:36.330]  I get it, but like, damn.
[01:07:36.330 --> 01:07:36.810]  I get it, too.
[01:07:37.450 --> 01:07:38.010]  Jalen Brown.
[01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:39.290]  Yeah, I knew you were hanging onto that one.
[01:07:39.330 --> 01:07:40.350]  Only bright spot of the fuck.
[01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:41.390]  Well, except we can't dribble.
[01:07:43.530 --> 01:07:44.090]  Demonta Sabonis.
[01:07:44.610 --> 01:07:45.350]  But he shot well.
[01:07:46.050 --> 01:07:46.610]  Anthony Davis.
[01:07:46.610 --> 01:07:47.850]  Ooh, I like that card.
[01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.010]  Amazing.
[01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:52.570]  I'm not, you know, don't know if I'm a big AD guy, but they're a great-looking card.
[01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:53.350]  Yeah, beautiful card.
[01:07:54.290 --> 01:07:55.830]  So, oh, here you go.
[01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:57.310]  Zion, your two card.
[01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.890]  Nice.
[01:07:58.090 --> 01:07:58.650]  Who knows?
[01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:59.750]  Who knows, Zion?
[01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:01.030]  It's kind of how that feels, huh?
[01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:01.850]  Peyton Pritchard.
[01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:06.910]  Fast P, or B-Rabbit, or Pee-Pee, as they call him.
[01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:07.810]  That's this guy, right.
[01:08:07.930 --> 01:08:08.050]  Yep.
[01:08:08.130 --> 01:08:08.290]  Yeah.
[01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:13.130]  And then, Denny Athesia, who I believe is Israeli.
[01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:13.850]  Yeah.
[01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:14.270]  Yeah.
[01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:18.670]  Three more packs of this.
[01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:19.050]  Okay.
[01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:20.570]  Let's see what fun stuff we get.
[01:08:23.890 --> 01:08:27.810]  Kelly Oubre, Jr. He is the current NBA's Mr. Stelio girl.
[01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.470]  Nice.
[01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:29.070]  As they say.
[01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:30.350]  Jarrett Allen.
[01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:31.970]  Very, very, very cool dude.
[01:08:32.050 --> 01:08:32.570]  Cool dude.
[01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:33.790]  Gamer.
[01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:34.250]  Big gamer.
[01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.610]  Yeah.
[01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:36.270]  Career lineage.
[01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:38.850]  We got, looks like, KD and KD.
[01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:40.970]  Here he is through his whole career.
[01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:43.230]  Newer version of the likable KD from OKC.
[01:08:45.130 --> 01:08:47.330]  Both of them are on Twitter defending himself.
[01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:49.770]  There's two Twitter accounts.
[01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:50.770]  Well, you can tell there's two.
[01:08:51.190 --> 01:08:52.930]  One's a burner account and one's him.
[01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:54.750]  Alexey Pokachevsky here.
[01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:55.110]  Rookie.
[01:08:55.410 --> 01:08:56.050]  Everybody loves him.
[01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:57.130]  He's seven feet tall.
[01:08:58.530 --> 01:08:59.410]  Theo Maladon.
[01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.890]  All right.
[01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:02.510]  Who's probably going to have a good career in the NBA.
[01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:03.810]  Two more packs.
[01:09:04.570 --> 01:09:05.290]  Oh, boy.
[01:09:06.450 --> 01:09:07.530]  How are you feeling about these?
[01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:08.230]  Feeling good.
[01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:10.210]  We haven't gotten an auto yet, and I think we're supposed to.
[01:09:10.330 --> 01:09:10.490]  Okay.
[01:09:10.890 --> 01:09:13.170]  So, maybe, maybe not.
[01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:15.730]  Darius Baisley.
[01:09:16.750 --> 01:09:17.490]  Kimba Walker.
[01:09:20.170 --> 01:09:22.310]  Did you just reluctantly hold on to that?
[01:09:24.230 --> 01:09:24.590]  Uh-huh.
[01:09:24.770 --> 01:09:25.830]  This is a big hit.
[01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:27.430]  Anthony Edwards.
[01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:27.830]  Okay.
[01:09:28.170 --> 01:09:28.510]  Rookie.
[01:09:29.010 --> 01:09:29.770]  Black Parallel.
[01:09:29.850 --> 01:09:30.210]  Nice.
[01:09:30.330 --> 01:09:31.210]  That's fucking awesome.
[01:09:31.530 --> 01:09:34.870]  Yeah, I have to hold on to all the Celtics cards, but Kimba was...
[01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:35.670]  Karis LeVert.
[01:09:35.890 --> 01:09:36.650]  Always really liked him.
[01:09:37.150 --> 01:09:37.910]  Malachi Flynn.
[01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:39.430]  Not even in the NBA anymore, I don't think.
[01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:40.970]  And Udoka Azeboke.
[01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:42.650]  Hey, look.
[01:09:42.670 --> 01:09:43.070]  It's Barbara.
[01:09:44.170 --> 01:09:49.110]  We made a Vancouver child kicker stamp and stamped it.
[01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:50.370]  Look what we got.
[01:09:52.730 --> 01:09:53.130]  Whoa!
[01:09:53.310 --> 01:09:53.950]  So we can make...
[01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:54.470]  Is that in use?
[01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.930]  Yeah.
[01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:55.650]  Oh, that's very cool.
[01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:56.690]  My Instagram.
[01:09:57.190 --> 01:09:57.590]  Oh, shit.
[01:09:57.670 --> 01:09:58.750]  We're on...
[01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:00.550]  Yeah, we're on roosterteeth.com.
[01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:01.750]  Say hello, Instagram.
[01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.790]  Hey, Instagram.
[01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:06.190]  Say hello, YouTube and Rooster Teeth.
[01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:07.110]  Whoa.
[01:10:08.190 --> 01:10:08.590]  Streamception.
[01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:13.930]  I'm in the lights, and I've noticed how greasy my face is.
[01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:15.610]  I noticed it, too.
[01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:16.210]  I just didn't say anything.
[01:10:16.350 --> 01:10:17.470]  It was pretty noticeable.
[01:10:17.730 --> 01:10:18.510]  I appreciate you not saying anything.
[01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:18.950]  Yeah, no problem.
[01:10:19.230 --> 01:10:20.030]  Yeah, I got you.
[01:10:20.770 --> 01:10:21.490]  Bye, guys.
[01:10:21.610 --> 01:10:21.970]  Bye.
[01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:23.490]  I like your stamp.
[01:10:23.650 --> 01:10:24.210]  Thank you.
[01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:25.150]  Fred Van Vliet.
[01:10:25.670 --> 01:10:26.210]  Oh, what?
[01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:27.050]  I like your Instagram.
[01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:28.570]  Terry Rozier.
[01:10:29.130 --> 01:10:29.890]  I like Fred Van Vliet.
[01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:30.630]  He's a little dude.
[01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:32.330]  Ooh.
[01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:34.850]  Rookie Reflections, Bam and Onyeka.
[01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.730]  Keep that.
[01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:37.010]  Drew Holliday.
[01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:38.670]  He's so good.
[01:10:39.170 --> 01:10:39.720]  Jalen Brunson.
[01:10:41.050 --> 01:10:41.790]  Also pretty good.
[01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:43.350]  And Tyrese Halliburton, rookie.
[01:10:43.570 --> 01:10:45.010]  Put a big one there.
[01:10:45.090 --> 01:10:48.130]  I was watching when we did this at RTX.
[01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:50.590]  Last year?
[01:10:51.610 --> 01:10:53.970]  And it was during World Cup stuff or whatever.
[01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:59.010]  And Drew Holliday is the card that we were talking about when I think England got a goal,
[01:10:59.070 --> 01:11:00.670]  like a goal scored on them or something.
[01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:01.650]  And it was just Gavin going,
[01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.970]  No!
[01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:03.610]  We didn't bring it home.
[01:11:03.730 --> 01:11:03.830]  Yeah.
[01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:05.750]  It's not coming home.
[01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:06.770]  Russell Westbrook.
[01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:07.230]  Uh-huh.
[01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:07.690]  Nice.
[01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:08.670]  What do you mean?
[01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:09.790]  That's my guy right there.
[01:11:09.810 --> 01:11:10.490]  Look at the...
[01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:11.990]  This guy can't go up.
[01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:13.290]  Oh, what the...
[01:11:13.290 --> 01:11:13.970]  He's like...
[01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:15.030]  How am I gonna defend that?
[01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:15.950]  He's...
[01:11:19.330 --> 01:11:20.050]  Brandon Ingram.
[01:11:20.490 --> 01:11:21.490]  Just let him shoot, man.
[01:11:21.970 --> 01:11:22.570]  P.J. Tucker.
[01:11:22.770 --> 01:11:26.250]  P.J. Tucker, I think, said he's leaving Miami.
[01:11:26.410 --> 01:11:27.270]  He wants to test the...
[01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.710]  Really?
[01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:28.850]  Yeah, Desmond Bain.
[01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:29.630]  I thought that was strange.
[01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:31.130]  Peyton Pritchard, second year card.
[01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:32.210]  Jason Tatum.
[01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.850]  Oh, wow.
[01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:33.210]  You got...
[01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:33.670]  Celtics.
[01:11:33.850 --> 01:11:35.570]  They always appear next to each other in this.
[01:11:36.490 --> 01:11:37.130]  For some reason.
[01:11:38.050 --> 01:11:38.770]  Kendrick Nunn.
[01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:40.610]  He is...
[01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:43.230]  He's in like a Polo G song I listen to.
[01:11:43.610 --> 01:11:43.850]  What?
[01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:45.210]  A lot of NBA players.
[01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:45.970]  A lot of like...
[01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:46.570]  A lot of like...
[01:11:46.570 --> 01:11:50.730]  Like C-level NBA players showing up in rap songs these days.
[01:11:50.850 --> 01:11:51.290]  I just...
[01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:52.470]  What, like you're listening to that?
[01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.930]  Alright, cool.
[01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:54.570]  Do you listen to Polo G?
[01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:55.350]  No, I just wasn't...
[01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:57.630]  That's not like the lane that I expected for you.
[01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.510]  Just saying.
[01:11:58.650 --> 01:11:59.410]  Polo G's fucking awesome.
[01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:00.390]  P.J. Washington Jr.
[01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:02.010]  Jay Crowder again.
[01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:03.490]  Trey Young again.
[01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:05.190]  We've already said stuff about these guys.
[01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:06.230]  Gary Chen Jr. again.
[01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:07.150]  All the same cards.
[01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:09.350]  Wendell Carter Jr.
[01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.830]  Great.
[01:12:10.150 --> 01:12:10.470]  He's...
[01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:11.510]  The thing about him is he's a junior.
[01:12:12.670 --> 01:12:13.470]  Norman Powell.
[01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:14.650]  Cole Anthony.
[01:12:14.650 --> 01:12:17.770]  He's the dude whose dad was an animal and mixtape dude.
[01:12:18.010 --> 01:12:18.950]  Oh, really?
[01:12:19.190 --> 01:12:19.310]  Yeah.
[01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:20.070]  Oh, that's sick.
[01:12:20.530 --> 01:12:21.650]  He's one of those dunkers.
[01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:22.810]  Malcolm Brogdon.
[01:12:24.230 --> 01:12:25.350]  Facundo Campozzo.
[01:12:25.710 --> 01:12:26.430]  Everybody loves him.
[01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:27.590]  Gordon Hayward.
[01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:28.790]  Somehow still in the NBA.
[01:12:29.650 --> 01:12:30.610]  Terrence Mann.
[01:12:31.450 --> 01:12:32.730]  Tyler Herro again.
[01:12:33.130 --> 01:12:33.190]  Boo.
[01:12:33.810 --> 01:12:34.770]  Kevin Love.
[01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:36.610]  Going gray gracefully.
[01:12:36.730 --> 01:12:37.310]  Appreciate it.
[01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:38.290]  Jordan Clarkson.
[01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:39.170]  Doing it for us.
[01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:40.570]  RJ Hampton.
[01:12:41.730 --> 01:12:42.950]  Oh, Daniel Gafford.
[01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:44.130]  Here we go.
[01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:46.550]  Daron Sharp.
[01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:47.470]  Pull that.
[01:12:48.170 --> 01:12:49.130]  Jalen Suggs.
[01:12:49.150 --> 01:12:49.810]  That's a good rookie.
[01:12:51.230 --> 01:12:53.250]  Suggy, I imagine they might call him.
[01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:53.930]  I don't know.
[01:12:54.730 --> 01:12:56.130]  I'm not a magic fan.
[01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:57.970]  But if I were a fan, I'd call him Suggy.
[01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:59.390]  They got magic fans?
[01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:00.070]  That's crazy.
[01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:01.370]  Jason Preston.
[01:13:02.690 --> 01:13:04.350]  I think there are tourists who go to Orlando.
[01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:05.030]  I think, yeah.
[01:13:05.050 --> 01:13:06.310]  I'm a Disney fan.
[01:13:06.450 --> 01:13:07.150]  Moses Moody.
[01:13:08.190 --> 01:13:11.350]  Here's our Cole Anthony green and yellow parallel.
[01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.890]  Oh, that's nice.
[01:13:13.810 --> 01:13:14.510]  That's good.
[01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.550]  Thank you.
[01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:16.470]  Oh boy.
[01:13:16.730 --> 01:13:17.130]  Oh.
[01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:23.850]  Is that it?
[01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:25.630]  Oh no.
[01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:26.210]  Oh.
[01:13:29.650 --> 01:13:30.610]  Hi there.
[01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:30.870]  Nope.
[01:13:30.970 --> 01:13:31.290]  Close enough.
[01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:32.230]  Alright, moving on.
[01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.970]  Can't find it.
[01:13:34.170 --> 01:13:36.190]  There's a Bill Russell insert.
[01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:40.230]  And a doo-doo Kevin Porter Jr.
[01:13:41.290 --> 01:13:41.610]  Insert.
[01:13:42.150 --> 01:13:42.930]  Nope, we've had room.
[01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:43.970]  That's why I haven't been using him.
[01:13:45.570 --> 01:13:46.350]  How about this?
[01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:48.030]  How about some Ghostbusters 2?
[01:13:48.130 --> 01:13:49.030]  Who are you gonna call?
[01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:54.830]  Have you seen that TikTok where they, like, the, like, Transformers on fire or whatever
[01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:56.450]  up on, like, the, like, the telephone pole?
[01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:56.770]  Uh-huh.
[01:13:56.850 --> 01:13:58.650]  And they go, who are we gonna call?
[01:13:58.730 --> 01:13:59.650]  And somebody goes, Ghostbusters.
[01:13:59.770 --> 01:14:00.950]  And it fucking explodes.
[01:14:01.450 --> 01:14:02.670]  The timing is perfect.
[01:14:03.050 --> 01:14:03.550]  It's really great.
[01:14:04.570 --> 01:14:05.830]  Merry Christmas, New York.
[01:14:05.890 --> 01:14:06.210]  Alright.
[01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:08.290]  Oh.
[01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:08.690]  Oh.
[01:14:08.690 --> 01:14:09.450]  So, what is his name?
[01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:10.970]  Janos?
[01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:12.090]  What a trip.
[01:14:12.850 --> 01:14:13.390]  Or Janos?
[01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:13.870]  Uh-huh.
[01:14:14.370 --> 01:14:15.610]  That's right, Ghostbusters!
[01:14:15.890 --> 01:14:19.710]  We're back and we're better than ever with twice the know-how and twice the particle
[01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:22.910]  power to deal with all your supernatural elimination needs.
[01:14:22.930 --> 01:14:23.790]  Is that Decroyed?
[01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.990]  Said Dan Aykroyd.
[01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:25.570]  Yeah, Decroyed.
[01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:25.850]  Yeah.
[01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:28.170]  Here's some Slimer artwork.
[01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:29.010]  Wow!
[01:14:29.370 --> 01:14:30.650]  An original onion head?
[01:14:30.810 --> 01:14:31.410]  That's incredible.
[01:14:31.930 --> 01:14:34.590]  Oh, here's a sticker of the boys.
[01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:36.450]  Liking that.
[01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:37.610]  That's a cool looking sticker.
[01:14:38.970 --> 01:14:39.930]  Sorry, guys.
[01:14:40.170 --> 01:14:40.650]  Classic.
[01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:42.190]  I ate all the hot dogs.
[01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:43.470]  Classic Slimer.
[01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:44.670]  You're keeping the Slimers, huh?
[01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:45.530]  Yeah.
[01:14:45.970 --> 01:14:47.370]  He's the star of Ghostbusters.
[01:14:48.690 --> 01:14:50.110]  Eat this, Viggo.
[01:14:50.690 --> 01:14:50.970]  Uh-huh.
[01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:51.870]  It was Viggo Mortensen.
[01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:54.890]  Yeah, Viggo Mortensen was in that and then he was in Easter Promise.
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:06.420]  Ghostbusters on trial.
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:07.940]  They're real different movies.
[01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:12.360]  You know that dude was married to Eggzine Cervenka?
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:12.980]  Really?
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:13.960]  Yeah, for a long time.
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.600]  They're divorced now, but yeah, for a really long time.
[01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:17.080]  All right, what's one that you want to get into?
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:17.940]  We got ten.
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:19.640]  Let's say we got ten minutes.
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.260]  Let's open up this box of heritage.
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:21.720]  This expensive?
[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:24.120]  The expensive box that you don't want.
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:24.840]  Let's do it.
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:25.120]  Yeah.
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:26.720]  It's not that I don't want it.
[01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:28.700]  That it was the wrong thing?
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.220]  Yeah, it's that I didn't want it.
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:31.900]  Not that I have it.
[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:33.280]  I'm like, I don't mind having it.
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.460]  It's just that it's not what I wanted.
[01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:36.460]  And I'm just fucking...
[01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:37.380]  I get...
[01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:37.600]  Uh-huh.
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:38.640]  Mad?
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:42.640]  Well, I get scatterbrained when I'm trying to do a lot of things at once.
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:44.640]  I got my head in a lot of places.
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:45.400]  Who are you talking about?
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:46.060]  And so I just bought the wrong fucking thing.
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:46.320]  You?
[01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:47.380]  There you go.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:51.660]  How about a Ronald Acuna Jr. big-ass card, as we call them?
[01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:52.460]  You're gonna sleeve that?
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:53.980]  I think I have the sleeve at home.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:55.820]  I hope I do.
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:57.240]  We'll open...
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:58.060]  Okay, so what are we...
[01:15:58.060 --> 01:15:58.440]  There you go.
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:00.440]  So what are we anticipating getting in this?
[01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:05.760]  Well, what we were looking for was the world's biggest airplane from the Alan and Ginter set.
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:06.520]  Oh, that's right.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:06.740]  Right.
[01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:07.580]  So you did not buy that.
[01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:08.380]  No, but I bought these.
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:08.640]  Yeah.
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:09.280]  So, uh...
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.220]  Do these have sharks in them, or is it just baseball?
[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:13.040]  I think they're just baseball.
[01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:15.660]  Those maybe were the craziest things you've ever opened.
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:16.520]  I think were sharks.
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:18.440]  It was like, here's...
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.520]  Franz Ferdinand being shot!
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:23.220]  Ozzie Albies!
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.900]  It's like, what the fuck is going on?
[01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:26.660]  Arthur Ashe.
[01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:27.280]  Tennis legend.
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:27.740]  Yeah.
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:29.760]  Okay.
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:32.520]  We'll open up these guys to close it out.
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:33.140]  All right.
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:33.740]  All right.
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:34.440]  Very exciting.
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.500]  At least it's this year's baseball.
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:37.460]  Hooray.
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:38.280]  Oh!
[01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:40.120]  Are they cool looking?
[01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:41.060]  Uh, yes.
[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:41.520]  Oh, great.
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:41.720]  That's what it sounds like.
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:43.620]  Emanuel, uh...
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:44.100]  Clace?
[01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:45.100]  Is that how you say that?
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:45.240]  Yep.
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:45.940]  Clace.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.160]  Mike Trout?
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:47.620]  Nice!
[01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:51.580]  Quietly the best player in baseball.
[01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:52.340]  TJ Freidel.
[01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:54.120]  They say he might be the best player of all time, huh?
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:55.680]  Uh, he's probably up there.
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:58.380]  I think he loves playing Anaheim because nobody gives a fuck and he doesn't have to deal with
[01:16:58.380 --> 01:16:58.580]  anyone.
[01:16:59.100 --> 01:16:59.380]  Really?
[01:16:59.620 --> 01:16:59.800]  Yeah.
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:00.520]  I think it's great.
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:03.440]  Mike Mustaska.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:04.740]  Mustakas.
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:05.300]  Mustakas.
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:05.680]  There you go.
[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:05.980]  There you go.
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:06.520]  Nailed it.
[01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:06.820]  Uh-huh.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:07.720]  Uh, Yohan Lakata.
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:08.960]  Jesse Chavez.
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:09.640]  Oh, right.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:10.560]  He said I could do it the right way.
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:11.440]  Jane Beaver.
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:13.080]  And, hey, Mookie Betts.
[01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:14.240]  Boo.
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:17.100]  Speaking of, everybody's favorite Dodgers.
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:17.920]  Yeah.
[01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:19.740]  I'm liking the Dodgers, man.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:20.940]  I'm enjoying being a Dodgers fan.
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:22.700]  You said you weren't even watching baseball!
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:24.780]  Uh, I'm starting to get back into it this year.
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:25.660]  I watched them last year.
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:26.540]  Rooted for them all the way.
[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:28.800]  Fuck that.
[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:30.280]  Uh, Bo Bichette.
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:31.340]  He's a Blue Jay.
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:32.440]  It's, uh...
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:33.200]  Jordan Montgomery.
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:35.400]  Aaron Judge.
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:36.980]  Bo Bichette's one of those kids.
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:39.520]  He's one of the baseball player kids that are on that team.
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:40.000]  Like Vlad.
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:40.820]  Like Vlad Jr.
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:41.500]  Yeah.
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:42.080]  Bo Bichette.
[01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:42.660]  What is it?
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:43.640]  Biggio's kid?
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:44.560]  Or Bagwell's kid?
[01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:45.160]  One of the two.
[01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:46.340]  It's, like, crazy.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:48.880]  Lars Neutbar.
[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:49.440]  Yeah!
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:50.200]  Lars Neutbar!
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:51.340]  Great baseball name!
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.220]  Great baseball name.
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:53.740]  Kyle Seager.
[01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:54.120]  Mm-hmm.
[01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:55.340]  Oh, here we go.
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:55.920]  This is cool.
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:56.700]  It's, uh...
[01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:57.160]  What do we got?
[01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:59.360]  Numbered, uh, 573.
[01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:00.860]  Here's a Walker Bueller.
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:02.940]  Uh, like...
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:04.340]  I guess, like, chrome.
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:05.580]  It almost feels like an old metal card.
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:06.600]  That's kind of cool.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:07.060]  Yeah.
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:09.380]  And then, uh...
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:12.040]  Oh, did you know that Dylan Carlson is a New Age performer?
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:13.220]  He's into Reiki.
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:13.620]  What?
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:14.940]  He does crystal therapy.
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:16.240]  Yeah.
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:16.960]  Cool.
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:17.920]  He did...
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:18.880]  Oh, you know, he does, uh...
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:19.860]  He says sound baths.
[01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:20.320]  Oh, wow.
[01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:21.020]  He's kind of like...
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:21.400]  He's like a...
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:22.620]  He's a Gua Sha practitioner?
[01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:22.840]  Mm-hmm.
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:23.400]  That's pretty great.
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:24.280]  Willie Castro.
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:25.840]  And, uh...
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.740]  Oh, did you know that Hernandez's hit decided it?
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:28.500]  I don't know what it decided.
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:29.800]  What the fuck?
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.540]  I don't like solid socks on baseball players.
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:36.280]  I think they should go back to stirrups.
[01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:37.440]  I don't like solid socks.
[01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:37.740]  I like stirrups.
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:40.380]  I'm fine with stant socks, because at least there's something.
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.520]  I don't like the solid sock look.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:43.760]  I think it sucks.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:44.460]  Right there with you.
[01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:45.400]  Chris Taylor.
[01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:46.560]  Ozzy Albies.
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:46.900]  Hey.
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:47.960]  John Lester.
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.160]  Uh, Griffin Jacks rookie.
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:50.820]  Take that.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:52.520]  Uh, Martin Maldonado.
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:53.400]  Mm-hmm.
[01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:54.160]  Uh, Will Smith.
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:54.800]  Different Will Smith.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:56.940]  Uh, another New Age performer.
[01:18:56.940 --> 01:19:00.300]  Uh, really into, uh...
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:01.960]  Really into, uh...
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:02.560]  You got it.
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:03.180]  John Tesh.
[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:03.760]  There you go.
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:03.940]  Yeah.
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:05.680]  Corbin Burns.
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:06.720]  Will Smith.
[01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:07.640]  I was struggling there for a second.
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:08.400]  You got it.
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.160]  Ooh, that's a fat pack.
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:12.580]  Yeah, why?
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:14.700]  This has a M.I.M. card in it, probably.
[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:15.320]  A what?
[01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:16.460]  M.I.M. card.
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:17.000]  Oh!
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:17.700]  Relic.
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:18.600]  Some...
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.000]  Guys, there's a M.I.M. card.
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:20.400]  Oh.
[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:25.280]  What do we got?
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:26.600]  Uh, we got DJ Peters.
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:26.920]  Okay.
[01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:28.200]  We got Jesus Lizardo.
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:28.760]  Good baseball player.
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:29.040]  Good baseball name.
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:30.660]  Uh...
[01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:31.920]  Edmundo Sosa.
[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:32.960]  Is he related to Sammy Sosa?
[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:34.020]  I don't know.
[01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:34.880]  Probably not.
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:35.400]  Probably not.
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:36.680]  Uh...
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:37.440]  Michael Pineda.

[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:39.960]  Brian Goodwin.
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:40.460]  Mm-hmm.
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:42.460]  Uh...
[01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:43.780]  Brandon Finding Nemo.
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:45.920]  Pablo Lopez.
[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:46.540]  Mm-hmm.
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:47.660]  Alec Mills.
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.540]  And Lamont Wade.
[01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:51.940]  All right, we're gonna open this little guy.
[01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:54.440]  And we're gonna save the fat one for last.
[01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:55.040]  You want that?
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:55.480]  No.
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:56.780]  Just looking at Alec Mills.
[01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:58.220]  Bummer.
[01:19:58.220 --> 01:19:58.300]  Come on.
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:19:59.920]  What's a bummer about him?
[01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:04.240]  His glasses, his chin hair, his whole look.
[01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:05.180]  Oh, yeah.
[01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:05.520]  Yeah.
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:05.960]  He's got...
[01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:07.140]  Yeah.
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.500]  He's kind of got that insult look.
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:11.080]  Yeah.
[01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:13.660]  Is this the one with M.I.M.s or whatever?
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:13.980]  I believe it is now.
[01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:14.460]  It's the next one.
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:14.700]  Oh.
[01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:16.340]  I'm building up anticipation.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:17.360]  Nick Pavetta.
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:18.880]  Miles Straw.
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:19.500]  Oh.
[01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:20.240]  Favorite utensil.
[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:20.960]  I saved that.
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:24.760]  I yelled at Miles Straw at a Round Rock Express game when he tried to steal second.
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:26.240]  And it was a foul ball.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:27.680]  And then we yelled, like, do it again.
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:28.660]  You can't steal second.
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:29.180]  Do it again.
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:30.340]  And then he got thrown out.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.700]  And he was pissed that we yelled at him.
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:35.660]  He was mad.
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:39.180]  He was not thrilled.
[01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:40.960]  He was probably like 24.
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:42.720]  And we were just fucking screaming at this guy.
[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:43.340]  That's awesome.
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:44.260]  I think about him all the time.
[01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:44.860]  Well, fuck him.
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:45.580]  Jordan Alvarez.
[01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:49.100]  Sandy Alcantara.
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:50.500]  I wonder if he's related to Sandy Alomar.
[01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:51.300]  Yes.
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:51.780]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:52.120]  My first name.
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:52.220]  Yeah.
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.240]  Same first name.
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:54.560]  Ryan Yarbrough.
[01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:55.000]  Mm-hmm.
[01:20:57.340 --> 01:20:57.980]  Seth Beer.
[01:20:58.220 --> 01:20:58.500]  Yeah.
[01:20:58.700 --> 01:20:59.580]  Goes in the condiments.
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:00.380]  Mm-hmm.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:00.580]  Yep.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:02.940]  I don't think you know what condiments are.
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:04.020]  A beer could be a condiment.
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:06.420]  This is fucked.
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:06.940]  It was a sauce.
[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:07.440]  Please don't.
[01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:08.500]  I'm glad no one dug her.
[01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:09.980]  If the other guys were here, we'd be in a fight.
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:11.320]  Well, they're not.
[01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:12.720]  They can't be bothered to show up to work.
[01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:16.700]  Chris Flexon and Miguel Rojas.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.220]  All right.
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:21.280]  All right.
[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:22.620]  This is it.
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:23.160]  This is the last one.
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:24.180]  I hope we get a Lubob.
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:25.720]  This is the last fucking...
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:26.540]  I would like a Lubob as well.
[01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:28.600]  This is the last fucking pack we're opening today.
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:29.120]  And we got memes.
[01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:29.780]  We're done.
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:31.840]  What do we got?
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:33.440]  Who are we looking at?
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.420]  Lars Hendricks and Mark Melancon.
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:36.740]  No, Mark Melanson.
[01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:37.320]  Yes.
[01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:37.980]  Don't worry about it.
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:38.660]  Melancon.
[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:39.780]  They were a Swedish punk band.
[01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:40.380]  Yes, they were.
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:41.340]  Cal Raley.
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:41.920]  Mm-hmm.
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:45.020]  Fran Milreyes.
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.280]  Hey, Franimal.
[01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:47.340]  He was great.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:48.120]  Don't they call him the Franimal?
[01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:49.620]  Yeah, he was a former Padre.
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:50.180]  He was great.
[01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:51.580]  Charismatic dude.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:52.080]  A lot of fun.
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:52.720]  I like that name.
[01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:53.200]  I like him.
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:54.560]  Mason Thompson.
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:55.120]  Mm-hmm.
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:55.900]  He looks like a mason.
[01:21:55.900 --> 01:21:57.300]  He's a high-length guy.
[01:21:59.140 --> 01:21:59.880]  Hyunjin Roo.
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:00.340]  Mm-hmm.
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:03.560]  Oh, Randy Rosarena did something.
[01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:05.580]  Alfonso Rivas.
[01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:07.340]  Why'd you save that one?
[01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:08.280]  He was a rookie.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:08.980]  Oh.
[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:10.000]  Austin Hayes.
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:11.520]  Victor Robles.
[01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:13.940]  Pete Alonso.
[01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:14.560]  All right.
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:16.680]  Oh, wow.
[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:18.040]  Look at this.
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:18.460]  What'd you get?
[01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:20.400]  Look at this fucking Patton Smith photo.
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:22.200]  Oh, no.
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:23.020]  Oh, yeah.
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:25.660]  This guy looks like he's in the band Puddle of Mud.
[01:22:25.660 --> 01:22:26.280]  Yeah, he does.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:26.680]  Like this.
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:29.620]  He looks pissed that he's, like, doing this.
[01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:30.980]  He does not want to take this photo.
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:32.420]  I have to play fucking baseball?
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:33.840]  He is.

[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:42.660]  Who is, uh...
[01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:44.740]  Can you believe he's still playing?
[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:45.740]  Still playing.
[01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:46.540]  That's absolutely insane.
[01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:48.120]  I'm going to use him to...

[01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:52.300]  Still playing.
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:53.460]  What are you...

[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:07.360]  I mean...
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:08.540]  He was good for a while.
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:09.020]  Yeah.
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:10.120]  He's trying.
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:12.740]  Hey, that's all we can ask of any of them.
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:13.960]  Just try their best.
