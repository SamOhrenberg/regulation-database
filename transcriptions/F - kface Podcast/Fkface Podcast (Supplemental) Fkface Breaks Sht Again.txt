[00:11.820 --> 00:20.120]  Hello and welcome to episode 2 of Face Breaks Shit, the not audio only podcast
[00:20.120 --> 00:23.600]  version of our audio only podcast where we aren't we're not doing the podcast
[00:23.600 --> 00:27.040]  but we are playing with baseball cards and other memorabilia. What a way to...
[00:27.040 --> 00:30.960]  Was that succinct enough? Absolutely not but it works. This one's gonna be
[00:30.960 --> 00:35.000]  interesting and I'll tell you why. Put a lot of preparation into run of show for
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.500]  episode 1. I actually wrote out a run of show. I don't do that ever, you know, I
[00:39.500 --> 00:44.900]  had it broken down. I had it broken down like Andrew when he was making Heisenjake
[00:44.900 --> 00:49.260]  a run of show for his 12-hour stream. I had it down... Why didn't you share that
[00:49.260 --> 00:53.600]  with me so I could share it with the crew so we would know what's happening?
[00:53.760 --> 01:00.080]  Well, I did share it... To be fair... To be fair, to be fair, I shared it
[01:00.080 --> 01:04.940]  with Andrew. Oh, cool. Yeah, at some point. I was trying to get you to help. You
[01:04.940 --> 01:10.760]  weren't. And so, anyway, this episode... That episode went terribly for me. I
[01:11.180 --> 01:14.720]  thought... Funny fact, I went back and watched it. I don't typically watch
[01:14.720 --> 01:19.480]  our stuff because I can't stand to look at you again or me ever. Different angle.
[01:19.860 --> 01:24.420]  Not so bad. I didn't have a lot of notes for me and I wanted to tell you, I
[01:24.420 --> 01:27.760]  didn't get a chance to tell you, I thought your sound effects work was
[01:27.760 --> 01:34.820]  fantastic. You were layering sounds and it was very comedic, Gavin. Excited to
[01:34.820 --> 01:40.640]  have you here in person. I'm glad to be here this time. Unfortunately, Geoff is
[01:40.640 --> 01:48.660]  here, Gavin's here, I'm here, Andrew's here, but Jack isn't. However, he is here in
[01:48.660 --> 01:57.060]  spirit. Oh, Jack, great. Hey, I got... So that, in anticipation of Jack making this one
[01:57.060 --> 02:01.380]  because he missed the first one, unfortunately, I went, I said, I'm gonna
[02:01.380 --> 02:04.800]  entice him, right? I gotta put some extra work into getting Jack here. So I
[02:04.800 --> 02:09.140]  went out and I bought, I got, because it's like his favorite movie, I got Jack
[02:09.140 --> 02:14.240]  Ghostbusters whole box. I actually got two of them. Just tons of Ghostbusters baseball
[02:14.240 --> 02:18.680]  cards. These are not cheap. These were a lot. I had to buy that shit for him. Your
[02:18.680 --> 02:29.100]  beard trimmer won't turn off. My beard... So it seems that... Where are you getting this information from? I have inside sources. The
[02:29.100 --> 02:33.560]  Fuckface social media team told me that they were excited to post some images
[02:33.560 --> 02:37.720]  that I sent them and then said, hang on, I'm invest, I'm investigating a weird
[02:37.720 --> 02:45.700]  noise, a humming noise somewhere within our walls. Now we've learned a beard trimmer. Just throw it away.
[02:45.920 --> 02:51.640]  Geoff just shaved his face, chucked it in a drawer, and closed it. Apparently I did. Here's what I
[02:51.640 --> 02:56.100]  suspect happened. I did shave, I did shave before I came. I suspect I turned it off,
[02:56.200 --> 02:59.620]  threw it in the drawer, maybe it got jostled and turned back on. Because it's
[02:59.620 --> 03:03.280]  pretty loud. I think I would have heard it. But we were shitting on Jack for a
[03:03.280 --> 03:09.710]  second. Let's continue that. Here I bought him some E.T. cards. I know he loves the 80s. So I got...
[03:10.220 --> 03:14.000]  Here's Bo. I assume they mean Bo Derek and not a monkey named Bo because there's
[03:14.000 --> 03:19.360]  also a monkey there. Bo Derek from Tommy Boy? Yes. 21 Jump Street. She was the hot mom in
[03:19.360 --> 03:26.660]  Tommy Boy. That's Richard Grieco, not the other one. Superman 3. I just... Did you
[03:26.660 --> 03:31.460]  know that Dallas has cards? You could get a Larry Hagman rookie in this entire...
[03:31.460 --> 03:36.060]  Do you think they have the one where the guy pulls back the shower curtain and it's like, oh it was all a dream?
[03:36.280 --> 03:39.520]  Like that's probably the chaser. Like that's a big one you want. Do you know how Dallas
[03:39.520 --> 03:44.760]  ended? It was after that dream shit. It ended apparently with the devil coming
[03:44.760 --> 03:49.180]  and convincing JR to shoot himself in the head and commit suicide. That's awesome!
[03:49.780 --> 03:55.000]  JR killed JR? Yeah. Who shot JR? Apparently. The devil made him do it. Look at some of this stuff. I haven't even looked at it.
[03:55.060 --> 03:59.480]  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Classic 80s stuff. Yeah. Trivia Battle Game...
[03:59.480 --> 04:06.120]  Who cares about that? BMX series. Extreme. Gavin and I are maybe gonna film a cool BMX move this week.
[04:08.980 --> 04:13.960]  Some upcoming f***face discussions. Yeah, that was a bit of a f***face discus... f***face discussion.
[04:14.500 --> 04:19.000]  Cool bike move I've been working on. Where's my bike? I keep reaching for his. The other one had a battery issue.
[04:19.380 --> 04:23.800]  You're the sound guy. Okay, so what I was getting at is I don't have a run of show for this episode.
[04:24.280 --> 04:26.900]  It's just gonna be kind of like a clusterfuck, but that's okay. I have
[04:26.900 --> 04:31.880]  littered the table with treasures as my girlfriend calls them for us to open and
[04:31.880 --> 04:35.940]  have fun with. For some reason we have a Shack Attack video game and a Flintstones
[04:35.940 --> 04:38.960]  yabba-dabba-doo. That's not a video game. It's a downtown shootout game and a
[04:38.960 --> 04:42.700]  Flintstones yabba-dabba-doo something. I bought these because Andrew asked me to.
[04:42.820 --> 04:47.400]  I want to hear from Andrew. How is Andrew today? I'm great. First of all, I didn't
[04:47.400 --> 04:51.720]  ask you to. I sent them to you and I said, I think these are cool. What do you
[04:51.720 --> 04:54.700]  think? You're like, they're f***ing great. Let's get them. And then that's all we sent.
[04:54.700 --> 04:59.280]  No, it was more like, Andrew, I believe it was, Andrew said, hey, can you send me a
[04:59.280 --> 05:02.360]  picture of everything that we have for the show? And I said, sure, here you go. And
[05:02.360 --> 05:05.800]  then Andrew said, thanks. I'm gonna put some effort into it this time because I
[05:05.800 --> 05:09.200]  really phoned it in and didn't try and sucked in the first episode. I don't want
[05:09.200 --> 05:12.780]  to be bad anymore on my job, so I want to try hard, try real hard, try real real
[05:12.780 --> 05:15.960]  hard. And then he sent me these and he said, hey, I think these are cool. What do
[05:15.960 --> 05:17.900]  you think? Do you think they're cool? And I'm like, seems like fun. Do you want to
[05:17.900 --> 05:20.940]  get into toys? And he's like, I think so. Could be interesting. And so I bought them.
[05:21.460 --> 05:23.680]  Andrew, do you consider this your job?
[05:25.500 --> 05:29.840]  Opening cards? No. Well, technically, I mean, it's part of the job, I guess.
[05:30.020 --> 05:30.700]  Very job content.
[05:31.300 --> 05:34.580]  Yeah, I mean, it's related. But once again, that's not how this went.
[05:34.800 --> 05:36.780]  What do you do for a living?
[05:37.700 --> 05:40.400]  That's what I do for a living. I invented dice as a child.
[05:41.460 --> 05:44.760]  Dice. Yeah, that's that's my background.
[05:46.060 --> 05:49.620]  But you we both I just said these are cool. I know they're not card things.
[05:49.620 --> 05:52.660]  Maybe we could explore this. And you're like, yeah, let's do it.
[05:52.680 --> 05:54.340]  All right. I disagree with this assessment.
[05:54.460 --> 05:58.620]  Well, your disagreement has been officially entered into the record.
[05:59.540 --> 06:02.000]  I'll type it into the eBay category search.
[06:02.540 --> 06:05.100]  That was a was that a regulation disagreement?
[06:05.420 --> 06:07.140]  Yeah. I want a regulation disagreement.
[06:07.460 --> 06:11.440]  Leather set, Napoleon Bonaparte, four hundred and fifty dollars.
[06:11.600 --> 06:12.580]  Cover is detached.
[06:13.340 --> 06:14.360]  Are you still looking at eBay stuff?
[06:14.400 --> 06:16.780]  Yeah, I just typed Andrew disagrees and that's what I got.
[06:16.780 --> 06:21.560]  So so did we talk about why all of your enticements for Jack
[06:21.560 --> 06:23.040]  just straight up didn't work on him?
[06:23.480 --> 06:24.640]  Oh, so here's a funny story.
[06:25.420 --> 06:26.640]  Jack couldn't make it today.
[06:28.260 --> 06:29.800]  Unavoidable, unavoidable that he couldn't make it.
[06:30.120 --> 06:31.740]  And this is I don't want to give too much away
[06:31.740 --> 06:35.280]  because this is leading into a future episode of Face
[06:35.820 --> 06:36.920]  where we discuss this link.
[06:37.000 --> 06:40.280]  But I will say Jack couldn't Jack couldn't make the stream today.
[06:41.320 --> 06:45.040]  But what Jack was able to do is we schedule the podcast
[06:45.040 --> 06:47.260]  I do with him to this morning
[06:47.260 --> 06:50.200]  to get in the way of not only my tennis lesson, but this.
[06:50.580 --> 06:55.060]  And so he managed to show up 30 minutes late to his own podcast
[06:56.080 --> 06:58.780]  that I helped him record this morning and then finished
[06:58.780 --> 07:02.740]  and then got in my car and immediately drove here to do this one.
[07:02.860 --> 07:04.420]  So he's not on.
[07:04.540 --> 07:06.160]  Yeah, that he's not that he's not available for it.
[07:06.320 --> 07:08.700]  But I was definitely available for his podcast.
[07:08.840 --> 07:11.800]  I'm sorry, our podcast this morning.
[07:12.340 --> 07:14.240]  Thought it was strange that when I said goodbye to him,
[07:14.240 --> 07:16.400]  we both just didn't come here and say hello.
[07:18.200 --> 07:19.500]  But it is what it is.
[07:20.040 --> 07:21.660]  What are you going to do? Say lovey.
[07:22.140 --> 07:23.640]  Should we open? What'd you say?
[07:24.440 --> 07:25.080]  Underleague Jack.
[07:25.580 --> 07:26.420]  Minor League Jack.
[07:26.600 --> 07:31.420]  Well, in order to understand that, tune in to the next episode of Fuck Face.
[07:31.760 --> 07:32.900]  Is it the next one or the next one?
[07:32.960 --> 07:34.500]  I don't know. We did two. I think it's the next one.
[07:34.560 --> 07:35.380]  We were too caught up.
[07:35.380 --> 07:37.600]  So we had to start building a buffer.
[07:37.900 --> 07:41.080]  The buffer is that we well, that was a source of conversation, too.
[07:41.140 --> 07:42.040]  The buffer is the worst, right?
[07:42.040 --> 07:44.860]  Because then you get stuck in the in the timeline of where you are.
[07:44.980 --> 07:46.740]  We have to record two next week as well.
[07:46.840 --> 07:48.360]  So I'm going to be all fucked up.
[07:48.460 --> 07:49.720]  But that's all you got.
[07:49.860 --> 07:51.420]  We could not have to do that.
[07:51.760 --> 07:55.000]  But by virtue of the way you live, you guys just keep going.
[07:55.160 --> 07:56.260]  We got to build more buffer.
[07:56.600 --> 07:57.120]  We need a buffer.
[07:57.260 --> 07:58.720]  There's root canals left and right. Yeah.
[07:58.920 --> 07:59.720]  You never know what's coming.
[07:59.800 --> 08:00.300]  You never know.
[08:00.460 --> 08:02.240]  Right off the plane in a different city.
[08:02.340 --> 08:08.360]  Yeah, every time this guy leaves his house, a wasp or a cucumber or flies attack.
[08:08.460 --> 08:10.340]  We haven't got to the cucumbers yet, but that's coming.
[08:10.340 --> 08:12.400]  No, he almost got killed by a cucumber.
[08:13.960 --> 08:16.860]  All right. We're 11 minutes in to this thing.
[08:17.020 --> 08:18.260]  Should we open up some cards? Yeah.
[08:18.480 --> 08:19.620]  All right. We're going to start.
[08:19.800 --> 08:21.680]  Fly. I hate the fly.
[08:21.860 --> 08:23.520]  It's following you. It's following you.
[08:23.640 --> 08:24.760]  This is you. This is your life.
[08:25.680 --> 08:27.700]  Look, it's right there on that pack.
[08:27.840 --> 08:29.880]  Probably my shit flew in on your head.
[08:30.020 --> 08:30.800]  Give me a bat.
[08:31.100 --> 08:32.560]  Yeah, there's a big bat right there.
[08:33.280 --> 08:37.500]  We do have a hidden full size fuck face bat that I realize is hidden by Gavin.
[08:38.280 --> 08:40.560]  As we do here at.
[08:42.900 --> 08:44.080]  Face break shit.
[08:44.620 --> 08:50.740]  We we collect baseball cards of the one and the only, the great.
[08:51.640 --> 08:52.840]  The insurmountable.
[08:53.200 --> 08:55.840]  Never beaten. Never bested in a physical contest.
[08:56.580 --> 08:57.500]  Godzimmer. Wow.
[08:57.780 --> 09:00.520]  So we'll we'll continue opening up a 40th anniversary.
[09:00.520 --> 09:02.160]  Tops baseball. Incredible.
[09:02.460 --> 09:03.780]  These puppies were 50 cents.
[09:04.100 --> 09:07.040]  That was street value back in the day when I was in high school.
[09:07.040 --> 09:09.340]  I assume they weren't any more 50 cents.
[09:09.540 --> 09:14.820]  Now, I will say there I think there's influence from this show on other things.
[09:15.260 --> 09:17.460]  And you follow the baseball subreddit.
[09:18.040 --> 09:22.780]  And right now, the number five post is Hall of Famer Pedro
[09:22.780 --> 09:24.640]  Martinez giving Don Zimmer the business.
[09:24.920 --> 09:26.100]  And it is just the video.
[09:26.840 --> 09:29.000]  It is just the video of that.
[09:29.480 --> 09:31.860]  So I watched it this morning again. Uh huh. Yeah.
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.080]  Oh, I watch. This is probably the fourth time I've seen it today.
[09:34.800 --> 09:38.280]  As with as with all card openings, we do in theory,
[09:38.380 --> 09:39.320]  because I think I forgot a bunch.
[09:39.700 --> 09:42.160]  We'll bring out the other member of.
[09:44.380 --> 09:45.360]  Base break shit.
[09:45.940 --> 09:48.500]  I'm getting my other full member of the show.
[09:48.600 --> 09:50.660]  You've got Gavin. You've got Geoff. You've got Eric.
[09:50.740 --> 09:53.080]  You've got a jealous Jack.
[09:53.140 --> 09:55.620]  I got Andrew. You've got the pack sack.
[09:55.820 --> 09:56.920]  That's right. Here it is.
[09:56.940 --> 09:57.560]  The pack sack.
[09:57.640 --> 10:01.360]  And as you know, if you knew if you knew, well, it's it's it's what it says.
[10:01.400 --> 10:01.900]  Just on that order.
[10:01.900 --> 10:04.060]  If you're new to this show,
[10:04.140 --> 10:07.560]  what we do is every time we open up some cards,
[10:07.880 --> 10:11.000]  we donate one pack to the sack.
[10:11.300 --> 10:13.760]  Perfect. And then at some point we will pull a sack pack out.
[10:14.380 --> 10:16.560]  We'll let you've not done it.
[10:16.600 --> 10:17.360]  I've never done it.
[10:17.460 --> 10:18.580]  We'll let you be the first.
[10:18.660 --> 10:20.140]  I think you used white on the bag.
[10:20.560 --> 10:21.900]  That's what they had at Hobby Lobby.
[10:21.960 --> 10:24.900]  I got. Oh, what are you opening?
[10:25.040 --> 10:26.160]  I just can't wait to be king.
[10:26.500 --> 10:27.460]  Oh, there's Lion King cards.
[10:27.720 --> 10:29.360]  Lion King cards. That's Simba on the front.
[10:29.500 --> 10:31.620]  That is. Do you think there will be a Simba card within?
[10:31.900 --> 10:33.060]  Tune in to find out.
[10:33.220 --> 10:33.940]  It will be a parallel.
[10:34.560 --> 10:35.400]  What is that?
[10:37.320 --> 10:38.440]  Do you mean what is a parallel?
[10:40.440 --> 10:42.400]  Der Koenig Der Lowen.
[10:42.960 --> 10:44.000]  Lion King in German.
[10:44.300 --> 10:46.760]  Ah, those might be those might be German Lion King cards.
[10:46.960 --> 10:48.900]  Oh, no, because El Rey Leon is on here.
[10:48.920 --> 10:50.100]  Also, Spanish. OK.
[10:50.280 --> 10:51.800]  How do you say Simba in German?
[10:53.520 --> 10:56.160]  I don't seem to see.
[10:56.880 --> 10:58.320]  Can I do a German accent?
[10:58.740 --> 10:59.300]  Is that allowed?
[10:59.680 --> 11:01.680]  I mean, anyway.
[11:01.680 --> 11:05.140]  You have your there's a card opening space here.
[11:05.260 --> 11:08.660]  Yeah. So that way you can see what cards you get.
[11:08.880 --> 11:10.680]  All right. So here this is this is going to be the beginning.
[11:11.060 --> 11:12.700]  Look at that. We have it in the picture in picture.
[11:12.860 --> 11:15.460]  Whoa. Full screen with it like this is exciting.
[11:15.940 --> 11:16.780]  Look at this.
[11:16.860 --> 11:18.720]  I will flip around and we're going to see what we got.
[11:18.840 --> 11:19.560]  OK, we're looking right.
[11:19.660 --> 11:21.260]  Once again, we're looking for Don Zimmer's.
[11:21.320 --> 11:22.960]  We're looking for drunk stepdads.
[11:23.220 --> 11:26.660]  I believe we were looking for a law firm.
[11:27.540 --> 11:29.060]  Good double barreled lawyer names.
[11:29.120 --> 11:31.240]  Yeah, I remember there was a Gagney
[11:31.240 --> 11:32.600]  Gagner thing, but that was hockey.
[11:32.800 --> 11:34.840]  So let's see what we got. We got Frank Viola.
[11:35.080 --> 11:37.100]  That's not where you put them down in the middle.
[11:37.400 --> 11:38.280]  Frank Viola.
[11:38.680 --> 11:38.880]  Right there.
[11:39.120 --> 11:40.420]  Nails done. They look really nice.
[11:40.560 --> 11:41.520]  Scott Ruskin. I didn't.
[11:41.600 --> 11:42.420]  But thanks for noticing.
[11:42.560 --> 11:43.820]  I just keep up on that.
[11:43.980 --> 11:47.360]  Eric Yelding, Darnell Coles, Ed Nunez.
[11:47.460 --> 11:48.620]  We want. Oh, Todd Zeal.
[11:48.940 --> 11:51.920]  He was he was a catcher for the St.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.060]  Louis Cardinals.
[11:54.560 --> 11:57.040]  And he was a pretty popular dude for a little while there.
[11:57.060 --> 11:58.300]  I don't think his career.
[11:58.940 --> 12:00.200]  Yeah, that only really took off.
[12:00.700 --> 12:03.780]  Unfortunately, Larry Kassian, I never heard of Tom.
[12:03.980 --> 12:05.320]  Oh, the perspective is.
[12:05.460 --> 12:06.780]  Well, now he looks sad.
[12:06.880 --> 12:09.520]  It actually looks like Don Zimmer's looking at the back of your head.
[12:09.720 --> 12:12.280]  Do we? Is he judging me?
[12:14.480 --> 12:15.520]  He's judging me. That's fine.
[12:15.920 --> 12:20.040]  This guy, do we have a category for just got broken up by my girlfriend
[12:20.040 --> 12:21.140]  and then had to take a photo?
[12:21.260 --> 12:23.960]  Oh, no, because I think Larry Kassian is.
[12:24.100 --> 12:24.680]  We go full screen.
[12:24.820 --> 12:26.660]  Can we can we can we get.
[12:26.660 --> 12:29.720]  I want you to see how that's a sad face.
[12:29.820 --> 12:31.940]  See, she broke up. He got dumped.
[12:32.220 --> 12:34.340]  Poor Larry. He. Wow. He does look sad.
[12:34.440 --> 12:35.620]  He. Oh, you know why?
[12:35.800 --> 12:36.860]  She did it in public.
[12:37.200 --> 12:40.320]  Oh, no. It's so she wouldn't make a scene.
[12:40.580 --> 12:42.980]  Yeah. And then even then he he had trouble holding it together.
[12:43.300 --> 12:44.380]  You know what's even worse about it?
[12:44.980 --> 12:47.720]  A little. In fact, she broke up with him six months before this photo.
[12:47.940 --> 12:49.200]  This is how sad he still is.
[12:49.220 --> 12:50.560]  He's hanging on. So we'll hold on to that.
[12:50.600 --> 12:51.340]  That's obviously a hit.
[12:51.380 --> 12:52.460]  We got Tom O'Malley.
[12:52.640 --> 12:53.680]  Let's get back to it.
[12:53.800 --> 12:55.800]  Donnie Hill, Greg Harris.
[12:55.800 --> 12:59.260]  I like the Red Sox logos on this particular year.
[12:59.420 --> 13:03.540]  Very cute. Tom Edens, Spike Owen.
[13:03.760 --> 13:05.820]  Not to be confused with anybody else named Spike.
[13:06.860 --> 13:09.720]  Ernie Witt, Mark Guthrie, Dave Lapointe.
[13:09.820 --> 13:10.600]  Bunch of doo doo.
[13:10.760 --> 13:12.940]  Is that the highest leg we've seen so far in the card?
[13:13.040 --> 13:15.440]  Oh, that might be because we should have a leg height.
[13:16.380 --> 13:17.680]  That? No. Oh, no.
[13:17.840 --> 13:19.980]  This one? The one. OK, OK.
[13:20.200 --> 13:22.320]  We're going to we're going to do Mark Guthrie.
[13:22.640 --> 13:23.700]  Sorry. It's right there.
[13:23.700 --> 13:26.300]  It's it's like we did it and it didn't matter.
[13:26.440 --> 13:27.380]  Yeah, I knew it wouldn't.
[13:27.640 --> 13:30.840]  But I had to like try, you know, and I'm not going to that.
[13:30.880 --> 13:33.000]  I mean, that's knee and ankle above really high.
[13:33.020 --> 13:33.960]  OK, really? Yeah.
[13:34.020 --> 13:36.000]  So let's go weird way to put it.
[13:36.080 --> 13:37.600]  Where do you penis?
[13:37.860 --> 13:40.480]  Where do where do we if this is going to be official?
[13:40.520 --> 13:41.300]  Where do we rank?
[13:42.120 --> 13:42.880]  Where do we measure by?
[13:43.020 --> 13:44.080]  I think you have to measure by heel.
[13:44.960 --> 13:46.340]  Oh, like the lowest height.
[13:46.460 --> 13:47.300]  Yeah, lowest point.
[13:47.520 --> 13:49.080]  So it's got to be heel. Yeah.
[13:49.520 --> 13:51.580]  So we're saying that's a dick height, huh?
[13:51.900 --> 13:53.300]  Right around. Yeah, that's heel to penis.
[13:53.300 --> 13:54.320]  Look at that shot.
[13:54.360 --> 13:55.580]  God, we have the best. Yeah.
[13:55.580 --> 13:56.420]  Look at that. Gorgeous.
[13:56.500 --> 13:58.080]  I would say it's killing it back there.
[13:58.280 --> 14:00.680]  That's a heel to penis of zero because they're along.
[14:00.780 --> 14:01.460]  It's true. It is.
[14:01.620 --> 14:04.160]  Yeah, we can then go plus or minus one based on.
[14:04.260 --> 14:06.580]  OK, so our first official heel to penis zero.
[14:06.900 --> 14:09.600]  That's good. That's that's by what others will be judged.
[14:09.800 --> 14:11.400]  Yeah, it's a great it's a great baseline.
[14:11.940 --> 14:14.300]  OK, kids throw. I can't throw the gum away.
[14:15.040 --> 14:16.740]  I mean, it's there for you if you want it.
[14:16.900 --> 14:20.040]  I'm good, I think. And oh, shit.
[14:21.040 --> 14:22.540]  Oh, oh, we got it.
[14:22.540 --> 14:25.300]  We got we got welcome to the Zim zone.
[14:26.320 --> 14:27.120]  Holy shit.
[14:27.140 --> 14:28.500]  That was an early Zimmer.
[14:28.680 --> 14:29.820]  Wow. Look at his face.
[14:30.480 --> 14:31.960]  Second pack. We got another.
[14:32.080 --> 14:33.560]  And it's the Zimmer card, too.
[14:33.640 --> 14:35.180]  It's the one that we love the most.
[14:35.320 --> 14:37.160]  He look at him back there. He's so excited.
[14:37.240 --> 14:39.280]  We love all the Zimmer cards, but this is.
[14:41.120 --> 14:44.560]  You know, these puppies are still going for about 10, 15 bucks on eBay.
[14:45.260 --> 14:46.680]  Really? I monitor it pretty closely.
[14:46.800 --> 14:49.120]  You know, we just got our first Zimmer and I'm excited to go through
[14:49.120 --> 14:49.840]  the rest of the pack.
[14:49.920 --> 14:51.960]  But you got something in the mail today.
[14:51.960 --> 14:52.900]  Should we go into that?
[14:52.960 --> 14:53.980]  Can you show that real quick?
[14:54.060 --> 14:56.500]  Let me just run through this real fast and show that there's nothing here.
[14:56.640 --> 14:58.380]  Terry Pendleton, Tom Foley.
[14:59.020 --> 15:01.500]  And nothing is trash in card collecting because I will find a way
[15:01.500 --> 15:02.860]  to do something fun with these. All right.
[15:03.900 --> 15:05.760]  Travis Fryman, Geoff Pico, Chris Gwynn.
[15:05.820 --> 15:06.740]  I wonder if he's Tony Gwynn's brother.
[15:07.240 --> 15:10.580]  Ricky Henderson, who only refers to himself in the third person.
[15:10.900 --> 15:14.080]  One of the greatest base dealers of all time.
[15:14.160 --> 15:17.200]  One of the greatest personalities of all time, Greg Olson and Jesse Roscoe.
[15:18.120 --> 15:19.060]  Let's do a little bit of mail.
[15:19.160 --> 15:21.140]  Yeah, this is you haven't seen this, Andrew.
[15:21.140 --> 15:22.060]  You haven't seen this.
[15:22.260 --> 15:23.140]  This is awesome.
[15:23.320 --> 15:24.480]  We got two cool things.
[15:24.900 --> 15:26.000]  Andrew's little voice.
[15:26.140 --> 15:26.980]  Yeah. Hang on.
[15:27.020 --> 15:28.400]  Let me turn up your little voice, Andrew.
[15:28.940 --> 15:30.620]  I'm going to do this one first.
[15:30.920 --> 15:31.820]  Next. Yeah.
[15:31.880 --> 15:32.980]  Oh, it's definitely a 10, baby.
[15:33.000 --> 15:36.120]  It's not in order of importance or anything.
[15:37.400 --> 15:41.100]  But I also welcome to the prepared show.
[15:41.180 --> 15:42.060]  Fuck face. Break shit.
[15:42.160 --> 15:44.500]  Well, so here's the deal.
[15:45.460 --> 15:48.500]  Somebody sent these cards in for us to open.
[15:48.680 --> 15:49.520]  Yeah, they're really cool.
[15:50.080 --> 15:51.160]  Thundercats. There's Conan.
[15:51.520 --> 15:53.500]  There's Milk and Cheese, which was a comic book, I believe.
[15:54.280 --> 15:56.400]  Troll. The trolls are popular.
[15:56.700 --> 15:57.920]  Got this plasm.
[15:59.420 --> 16:00.620]  Right here. Here we go. Yeah.
[16:00.960 --> 16:03.080]  So just just a bunch of cards to open up.
[16:03.160 --> 16:03.700]  Thundercat. Right.
[16:03.800 --> 16:04.400]  Which is really cool.
[16:04.680 --> 16:06.400]  Easter egg cards or Easter cards.
[16:07.660 --> 16:10.440]  I don't know what that piece of paper that said who sent it to us went.
[16:10.580 --> 16:11.080]  It was Caleb.
[16:11.480 --> 16:13.220]  Caleb Miller or Caleb Moore.
[16:13.420 --> 16:14.160]  Or it was Caleb.
[16:14.620 --> 16:15.960]  So, Caleb, thank you for sending these to us.
[16:15.980 --> 16:17.160]  We will open some of them up today.
[16:17.220 --> 16:19.320]  We will put some of them in the pack sack.
[16:20.260 --> 16:21.820]  Love you. Appreciate it.
[16:22.120 --> 16:25.800]  The other thing that we got is from Gavin.
[16:25.940 --> 16:26.600]  You're going to love this one.
[16:26.860 --> 16:28.360]  This is from a guy named Justin Faircloth.
[16:28.460 --> 16:32.300]  Justin is an artist and he specializes in custom painted sports cards.
[16:32.580 --> 16:34.860]  And he's a big Rooster Teeth fan. Big.
[16:37.200 --> 16:38.000]  F*** Face fan.
[16:38.520 --> 16:41.900]  And he made a one of a kind custom.
[16:42.760 --> 16:44.220]  This is going to blow your dick off.
[16:47.520 --> 16:51.860]  F*** Face, one of one, Zimmer Zone.
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.560]  So it's even got the Popsic logo that's on my shirt.
[16:54.640 --> 16:55.560]  So check this out.
[16:55.960 --> 16:57.060]  It is one of one.
[16:57.440 --> 17:01.200]  It is a Don Zimmer card that he has customized.
[17:01.200 --> 17:04.500]  He's customized this Don Zimmer card.
[17:04.600 --> 17:05.680]  You can see it right there.
[17:05.920 --> 17:09.400]  That is so cool knowing that there's a Zimmer under there.
[17:09.460 --> 17:11.380]  Yes. So that's what it started like.
[17:11.720 --> 17:13.140]  And this is where we finish.
[17:13.140 --> 17:14.240]  That's why I wanted to show it.
[17:15.240 --> 17:15.640]  Awesome.
[17:16.060 --> 17:17.180]  You can see his shirt still.
[17:19.240 --> 17:23.540]  So, Justin and Caleb, you two are f***ing legendary heroes.
[17:23.780 --> 17:24.620]  Thank you so much.
[17:25.440 --> 17:28.900]  We will hold on to this forever.
[17:28.980 --> 17:29.460]  Oh, absolutely.
[17:29.600 --> 17:30.100]  This is invaluable.
[17:30.420 --> 17:32.080]  The way he kind of like drew it under the hat.
[17:32.080 --> 17:33.260]  Yes. It's so awesome.
[17:33.520 --> 17:34.700]  It's so beautiful. It's so amazing.
[17:34.880 --> 17:36.400]  So it's a it's a one of one, too.
[17:36.540 --> 17:37.760]  That's that's all right.
[17:38.160 --> 17:39.080]  Here's what I can't.
[17:39.260 --> 17:42.420]  I can't hold on to it forever, but I will set the price tag at eleven million dollars.
[17:42.420 --> 17:42.960]  Wow.
[17:43.100 --> 17:45.080]  So if anybody wants to buy this car for eleven million dollars,
[17:45.240 --> 17:48.900]  I have to give at least half of it to Justin for making it.
[17:49.000 --> 17:49.340]  Right, right, right.
[17:49.400 --> 17:51.220]  So and then there's taxes and stuff.
[17:51.940 --> 17:54.220]  So what would you do with four hundred five sauce containers?
[17:54.700 --> 17:58.420]  It's that in the realm on the sauce to dollar calculator.
[17:58.860 --> 17:59.760]  How close am I?
[18:01.440 --> 18:04.120]  He thinks his sauce is worth eleven million dollars.
[18:04.620 --> 18:06.280]  Is I'm just asking how close I am.
[18:06.340 --> 18:09.240]  I think I'm asking what percentage of the way am I with four and five?
[18:09.320 --> 18:12.400]  Oh, what? Oh, you're one point nine percent of the way.
[18:13.440 --> 18:15.460]  OK, so just consider that.
[18:16.020 --> 18:19.560]  And then because Caleb was so nice to to send us these,
[18:19.780 --> 18:22.900]  let's open up some Conan and Thundercats, and then we'll put the rest
[18:22.900 --> 18:24.600]  in the pack sack for a later day.
[18:24.720 --> 18:25.840]  I'm going to look at my Lion King.
[18:26.040 --> 18:26.940]  Yeah, open up your Lion King.
[18:27.420 --> 18:29.000]  I can't wait to open Lion King.
[18:29.560 --> 18:31.080]  Name some Lion King characters.
[18:31.540 --> 18:34.140]  Simba, Timon, Pumbaa,
[18:36.520 --> 18:39.740]  Rafiki, the hyenas.
[18:41.780 --> 18:42.740]  Oh, Jafar.
[18:45.100 --> 18:47.360]  These are fancy.
[18:48.120 --> 18:49.300]  Now you're thinking of the Scar.
[18:49.500 --> 18:51.340]  Oh, right. Yeah, that's the same.
[18:51.600 --> 18:53.200]  Oh, Conan fought a shark.
[18:53.580 --> 18:54.640]  There's a Megalodon.
[18:55.560 --> 18:56.940]  These cards suck.
[18:57.540 --> 18:59.120]  Is there a Happy Days pack of cards?
[18:59.680 --> 19:00.660]  Yeah, I think there are actually.
[19:02.620 --> 19:05.500]  Oh, this is Conan fighting.
[19:06.580 --> 19:08.120]  Oh, you get Rowan Atkinson?
[19:08.120 --> 19:09.720]  They're on the front and the back.
[19:10.820 --> 19:11.540]  That's pretty cool.
[19:11.640 --> 19:12.120]  There's two-sided.
[19:12.360 --> 19:13.200]  Yeah, these are two-sided.
[19:13.600 --> 19:16.020]  It's got the Pumbaa and it's like the Pumbaa's on the other side.
[19:16.340 --> 19:17.100]  It's double Pumbaa.
[19:18.460 --> 19:21.300]  Maybe the backside makes a picture or something.
[19:21.340 --> 19:21.760]  Well, it's not.
[19:21.920 --> 19:22.840]  It's just says Timon and Pumbaa.
[19:23.100 --> 19:23.480]  Oh, OK.
[19:24.980 --> 19:26.300]  Yeah, we got dual Pumbaa's.
[19:27.440 --> 19:28.720]  Nala, she can't believe it.
[19:28.800 --> 19:29.240]  Look at this.
[19:29.720 --> 19:31.260]  She can't even fucking believe this shit.
[19:31.360 --> 19:31.920]  She is pretty...
[19:34.860 --> 19:36.120]  I'm going to call that a hit, actually.
[19:36.200 --> 19:37.040]  Yeah, it's a pretty nice one.
[19:37.560 --> 19:38.500]  This is Sarabi.
[19:38.640 --> 19:39.860]  She's a beautiful lioness.
[19:39.980 --> 19:40.780]  It's on the back.
[19:41.700 --> 19:43.440]  Oh, and you can learn a little bit about her, too.
[19:43.660 --> 19:44.060]  That's fun.
[19:44.200 --> 19:45.080]  She's wise and courageous.
[19:45.380 --> 19:46.200]  Is that Simba's mom?
[19:46.760 --> 19:48.280]  Yeah. And then this is Rafiki.
[19:48.360 --> 19:49.120]  I got his name right.
[19:49.440 --> 19:49.860]  Yeah. Yeah.
[19:50.180 --> 19:51.300]  And now here are the...
[19:51.300 --> 19:51.820]  This is...
[19:51.820 --> 19:52.580]  She got Darth Vader.
[19:52.900 --> 19:55.520]  Shenzi, Bonsai and Ed?
[19:56.000 --> 19:56.700]  Is Ed one of the...
[19:56.700 --> 19:56.920]  And Ed.
[19:57.500 --> 19:59.060]  One of them is Whoopi Goldberg.
[19:59.240 --> 19:59.460]  Yeah.
[20:00.100 --> 20:02.460]  Oh, Zazu is the bird.
[20:03.240 --> 20:03.480]  Yeah, yeah.
[20:03.700 --> 20:06.360]  And then look, we got more Pumbaa's.
[20:06.800 --> 20:07.900]  Oh, he's eating the grub.
[20:07.960 --> 20:08.400]  There's going to be a lot.
[20:08.560 --> 20:09.860]  There's too many Pumbaa's.
[20:09.940 --> 20:10.640]  A lot of Pumbaa's.
[20:10.680 --> 20:11.500]  I don't like the Pumbaa's.
[20:11.580 --> 20:12.120]  There's too many.
[20:12.840 --> 20:13.440]  All right.
[20:13.500 --> 20:14.540]  And then we got a...
[20:15.100 --> 20:17.380]  Looks like Conan fighting some sort of a bird Gavin.
[20:17.480 --> 20:18.100]  Oh, that's sick.
[20:18.180 --> 20:19.260]  It is a bird Gavin.
[20:19.600 --> 20:20.520]  Show the audience.
[20:20.860 --> 20:21.320]  Show the audience.
[20:24.320 --> 20:25.960]  It's so hard to see.
[20:26.040 --> 20:26.560]  I want to see it big.
[20:27.620 --> 20:28.440]  Look at that. Look at that.
[20:29.120 --> 20:30.020]  What is that?
[20:30.360 --> 20:30.500]  Look at it shine.
[20:30.840 --> 20:33.740]  It's Conan fighting some sort of a British bird man.
[20:34.600 --> 20:36.120]  Here's Conan fighting a...
[20:36.820 --> 20:37.260]  Anubis?
[20:37.380 --> 20:38.800]  Yeah, a bunch of Anubis.
[20:38.920 --> 20:40.220]  Here's Conan fighting a snake.
[20:40.360 --> 20:40.940]  I hope he wins.
[20:41.060 --> 20:41.920]  He's an Anubi.
[20:42.680 --> 20:44.120]  Oh, that could be our lawyer card.
[20:44.180 --> 20:45.140]  Anubis and Anubis.
[20:46.180 --> 20:47.100]  Anubis and Anubis.
[20:47.320 --> 20:50.680]  That's a good one.
[20:51.240 --> 20:52.240]  Oh, this is my favorite one.
[20:52.540 --> 20:53.000]  I like this one.
[20:53.280 --> 20:53.980]  This is Conan.
[20:55.200 --> 20:59.720]  This is probably the inspiration for the Meg, actually, I would assume.
[21:00.100 --> 21:02.660]  Jason Statham was probably channeling his inner Conan.
[21:03.280 --> 21:04.220]  I like that one.
[21:04.300 --> 21:07.520]  Are these the 1995 Chromium series?
[21:07.920 --> 21:08.460]  I believe they are.
[21:08.840 --> 21:12.400]  I think it looks like the whole set of these are only worth $10.
[21:12.880 --> 21:15.400]  Well, on eBay and not sold yet.
[21:15.500 --> 21:18.880]  Until we create that value, like we did with Don Zimmerman.
[21:19.880 --> 21:23.220]  By showing the world how much fun this dumb shit is.
[21:23.320 --> 21:23.940]  What do we got over here?
[21:23.960 --> 21:24.500]  Some Thundercats.
[21:24.540 --> 21:25.500]  You guys remember the Thundercats, right?
[21:25.740 --> 21:27.180]  Did they have Thundercats in England?
[21:27.600 --> 21:27.800]  Yeah.
[21:28.060 --> 21:31.020]  They didn't call them Thunder Felines or Action Cats?
[21:31.300 --> 21:32.300]  Lightning Felines.
[21:32.300 --> 21:33.160]  Action Cats.
[21:34.360 --> 21:35.440]  Upcoming as well.
[21:35.600 --> 21:36.060]  Yeah, really.
[21:36.180 --> 21:40.640]  We got we had a lot in the last couple of episodes that we just recorded.
[21:40.880 --> 21:42.660]  Ooh, Lion-O.
[21:43.200 --> 21:43.540]  What?
[21:44.120 --> 21:45.880]  Ooh, for the eye of Thundera.
[21:46.040 --> 21:47.960]  And sort of, ooh, this is a nice Lion-O.
[21:48.600 --> 21:51.940]  We got some, uh-huh, and that.
[21:53.000 --> 21:54.280]  And yeah, there we go.
[21:54.320 --> 21:55.300]  There you go, look at those cats.
[21:55.460 --> 21:55.780]  All right.
[21:55.920 --> 21:57.000]  Well, we already pulled a Zimmer.
[21:57.160 --> 21:59.100]  So I don't think we need to hit the baseball any harder.
[21:59.260 --> 22:00.300]  We succeeded there.
[22:00.680 --> 22:02.580]  What, one Zimmer per break shit?
[22:03.120 --> 22:03.400]  Yes.
[22:03.520 --> 22:04.720]  Yeah, we're averaging a Zimmer per break shit.
[22:04.900 --> 22:05.260]  That's it.
[22:05.580 --> 22:08.180]  So we could we could dip into some of the other stuff I got.
[22:08.280 --> 22:09.880]  I got a lot here we could play with.
[22:09.980 --> 22:12.660]  Some of it is for a future date.
[22:12.780 --> 22:16.660]  You can see over there, Gavin, in that corner, I got a little pile of, uh...
[22:16.660 --> 22:18.260]  It's, uh, you're looking too far over.
[22:18.340 --> 22:18.840]  It's on the table.
[22:19.300 --> 22:20.500]  We got Twin Peaks.
[22:21.600 --> 22:22.560]  Oh, that's not for today.
[22:22.560 --> 22:23.280]  We got Twin Peaks.
[22:23.360 --> 22:24.900]  We got the Umbrella Academy and Game of Thrones.
[22:24.980 --> 22:26.800]  That's going to be for the panel we do at RTX.
[22:27.200 --> 22:27.480]  Yes.
[22:27.620 --> 22:28.940]  I think we're going to do this show at RTX.
[22:29.180 --> 22:29.340]  Yep.
[22:29.840 --> 22:31.240]  That'll be on the 11th.
[22:31.300 --> 22:32.360]  Base break shit.
[22:32.440 --> 22:33.500]  Episode three, I guess.
[22:33.740 --> 22:35.220]  Who are you hoping for in Twin Peaks?
[22:35.340 --> 22:35.980]  Who are you hoping to get?
[22:36.760 --> 22:37.480]  Oh, dude.
[22:37.680 --> 22:38.560]  I'm hoping for Leland.
[22:38.820 --> 22:41.380]  I like I would love anything Nadine related.
[22:41.640 --> 22:45.060]  Like if you could get some some some draperunners from Nadine, that'd be cool.
[22:45.320 --> 22:46.120]  Like a relic card.
[22:46.360 --> 22:47.860]  I just hope it's like eye patch.
[22:47.980 --> 22:50.420]  I want like the like the Laura Palmer chaser.
[22:50.740 --> 22:53.160]  I think that'll be good.
[22:53.300 --> 22:54.220]  There you go. Yeah.
[22:55.180 --> 22:56.140]  Uh, OK.
[22:56.680 --> 22:57.820]  What are we doing next?
[22:58.080 --> 22:58.680]  Do you want to open?
[22:58.800 --> 22:59.960]  Let me open a story.
[23:00.340 --> 23:00.940]  How about that?
[23:01.340 --> 23:02.120]  I'm going to open with a story.
[23:02.720 --> 23:06.240]  So I've been trying to figure out ways to engage Gavin in collectibles.
[23:07.460 --> 23:09.760]  He almost wasn't engaged in that story.
[23:10.160 --> 23:13.020]  So, no, I mean, obviously you're right here and you're engaged,
[23:13.120 --> 23:16.080]  but I want to find a way to connect with you in a way that I can't do
[23:17.060 --> 23:20.280]  with, I don't know, hockey cards or top stadium club.
[23:20.580 --> 23:22.060]  And I thought, like, what does Gavin love?
[23:22.620 --> 23:24.020]  Put a lot of thought and effort into this.
[23:24.700 --> 23:26.100]  And I came up with it.
[23:27.960 --> 23:30.380]  I came up with James Bond.
[23:30.720 --> 23:32.880]  Gavin loves James Bond.
[23:33.860 --> 23:37.680]  I had one time I briefly thought I knew more about James Bond than Gavin.
[23:37.960 --> 23:40.240]  He shut me down in 1.2 seconds.
[23:40.540 --> 23:43.640]  Wow. I've not since talked to him about James Bond ever again.
[23:43.720 --> 23:44.240]  Learned that lesson.
[23:44.980 --> 23:46.200]  So I thought I'll get.
[23:46.760 --> 23:47.980]  Well, maybe there's James Bond cards.
[23:48.340 --> 23:50.300]  I think that was the only time I ever surprised you.
[23:50.560 --> 23:51.380]  I was pretty surprised.
[23:52.120 --> 23:53.320]  I did not appreciate it.
[23:53.880 --> 23:57.420]  And so I looked and lo and behold, James Bond cards exist.
[23:57.600 --> 23:58.740]  007 collectible cards.
[23:58.940 --> 24:00.500]  And so I went right out and I bought them.
[24:00.860 --> 24:03.580]  And then when they arrived, I was telling Andrew of this story.
[24:04.240 --> 24:07.420]  I realized I somehow didn't buy James Bond cards.
[24:07.600 --> 24:09.340]  I bought James Bond pogs.
[24:09.780 --> 24:13.480]  So what I have is a box I paid
[24:13.480 --> 24:17.540]  $55 for that is full of James Bond
[24:19.080 --> 24:20.040]  magic caps.
[24:22.360 --> 24:23.320]  That shit up.
[24:23.520 --> 24:24.080]  You're welcome.
[24:24.100 --> 24:26.620]  You were so excited when you got those.
[24:26.700 --> 24:28.060]  You're like, I got a deal on these.
[24:28.120 --> 24:29.040]  I got to hop on it.
[24:29.260 --> 24:30.600]  And you got pogs.
[24:30.880 --> 24:33.020]  You didn't realize we had a brief moment before.
[24:33.140 --> 24:35.540]  We're like, I was very mad at me.
[24:38.400 --> 24:40.260]  What was the listing? I've got to see that, right?
[24:40.300 --> 24:41.680]  I've never even owned a pog.
[24:41.940 --> 24:45.480]  I don't I mean, you just gave away all of the pogs you owned.
[24:46.460 --> 24:48.280]  Yeah, each packet contains
[24:49.160 --> 24:53.020]  six magic caps or four magic caps and a slammer.
[24:53.260 --> 24:55.900]  Whoa. Do you think pogs are coming back?
[24:56.320 --> 24:56.900]  You know what I mean?
[24:56.900 --> 25:00.820]  Like, well, if I accidentally buy some more, we might have to make sure they come back.
[25:01.060 --> 25:01.960]  Do you want to each open a pack?
[25:01.980 --> 25:05.080]  Yeah, we'll open a pack and then we'll move on to.
[25:06.480 --> 25:07.140]  Oh, no.
[25:07.240 --> 25:09.200]  How I rectified the situation.
[25:09.540 --> 25:10.840]  OK, here we go.
[25:10.920 --> 25:14.660]  We have an angry accountant.
[25:15.740 --> 25:16.500]  Wait, who did you get?
[25:16.560 --> 25:16.860]  I want to see.
[25:17.160 --> 25:19.560]  We have a James Bond.
[25:20.700 --> 25:21.780]  We have a.
[25:22.440 --> 25:23.260]  I think you've got.
[25:23.320 --> 25:24.560]  What I think is a it's.
[25:24.700 --> 25:25.520]  I think that's Michigan.
[25:25.700 --> 25:26.520]  And then you've got
[25:27.640 --> 25:28.580]  someone from the military.
[25:28.780 --> 25:29.900]  I can't see because they're hiding.
[25:31.240 --> 25:32.040]  These suck.
[25:32.220 --> 25:33.080]  This is a.
[25:34.200 --> 25:36.360]  These these are fucking garbage.
[25:36.540 --> 25:37.320]  Yeah, no, I'm not.
[25:37.380 --> 25:38.520]  Dude, straight up.
[25:38.780 --> 25:39.620]  No, look at.
[25:39.760 --> 25:42.500]  OK, look, here's M or whatever.
[25:42.640 --> 25:43.360]  Like there's stuff here.
[25:43.360 --> 25:45.440]  Yeah, look at this one.
[25:45.520 --> 25:46.660]  Oh, you got Dench.
[25:46.920 --> 25:49.980]  That's the that's the seven satellite.
[25:50.140 --> 25:51.700]  OK, I knew you'd defend one.
[25:51.840 --> 25:52.340]  Here's this.
[25:52.860 --> 25:54.260]  Oh, how about that one, Gav?
[25:54.400 --> 25:57.900]  That's when he shot the barrels.
[25:58.060 --> 25:58.940]  And all right.
[25:59.420 --> 26:00.260]  Oh, you go.
[26:00.940 --> 26:05.320]  Oh, you know, the best one.
[26:05.900 --> 26:07.420]  I've got I've got these.
[26:07.520 --> 26:08.300]  How do you hide it?
[26:08.660 --> 26:10.920]  Because the thing's blowing up garbage.
[26:11.360 --> 26:12.820]  I don't know what this one is.
[26:12.820 --> 26:14.140]  Some sort of office.
[26:14.280 --> 26:15.120]  Do we get the same Pog?
[26:15.160 --> 26:16.120]  We got the same Pog.
[26:16.400 --> 26:17.720]  Well, hey, we can trade now.
[26:18.400 --> 26:19.820]  I'm playing. We trade with somebody.
[26:19.880 --> 26:21.260]  You got Natalia again.
[26:21.300 --> 26:23.400]  You got Aramoff and Jean Grey.
[26:27.040 --> 26:27.400]  Yeah.
[26:27.880 --> 26:29.140]  Why did you buy these?
[26:29.340 --> 26:30.360]  Well, it wasn't on purpose.
[26:30.520 --> 26:33.580]  OK, so anyway, Gav, you have about a thousand more of those.
[26:33.720 --> 26:35.020]  A thousand more.
[26:35.600 --> 26:36.260]  And a fly.
[26:36.860 --> 26:39.880]  So I got mad at I got mad at Geoff for that one.
[26:39.980 --> 26:40.900]  I'm a Ricky Henderson.
[26:41.220 --> 26:42.000]  Yeah, I'm mad at Geoff.
[26:42.000 --> 26:43.840]  And I said, Geoff, what are you doing?
[26:44.180 --> 26:45.080]  That's not going to work.
[26:45.140 --> 26:46.620]  That'll be good for one joke.
[26:46.700 --> 26:47.740]  And that joke just happened.
[26:47.820 --> 26:48.780]  I want to find a slammer.
[26:48.840 --> 26:49.080]  Yeah, right.
[26:49.180 --> 26:50.240]  We have an hour and a half to go.
[26:50.820 --> 26:52.700]  Oh, a shiny Brosnan.
[26:53.520 --> 26:54.220]  Well, wow.
[26:54.800 --> 26:55.860]  OK, well, that's pretty cool.
[26:55.920 --> 26:56.980]  I'm going to that's pretty.
[26:57.260 --> 26:59.320]  That's another Xenia on a top.
[26:59.400 --> 27:00.320]  I'm going to call that a hit.
[27:00.460 --> 27:01.260]  Such a cool name.
[27:03.280 --> 27:04.380]  Oh, Sean Bean.
[27:05.460 --> 27:06.960]  Oh, 006. Get beaned, bro.
[27:07.160 --> 27:07.620]  Look at that.
[27:08.160 --> 27:09.260]  For England, James?
[27:12.340 --> 27:13.700]  It's his famous Sean Bean quote.
[27:13.880 --> 27:14.460]  Yep. Yep.
[27:14.540 --> 27:15.620]  Oh, sorry. Is that keeping you?
[27:15.780 --> 27:16.600]  Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.
[27:17.200 --> 27:19.360]  So what happens when he has you engaged in something
[27:19.360 --> 27:20.240]  and then it becomes now?
[27:20.360 --> 27:21.240]  Now you like it too much.
[27:21.340 --> 27:22.860]  I'm going to go until I find a slammer.
[27:23.120 --> 27:24.240]  Well, you can do that.
[27:24.360 --> 27:26.120]  Oh, and then you can slam all these pogs.
[27:26.140 --> 27:27.340]  We'll stack them up and slam them.
[27:27.580 --> 27:28.860]  Why do you play pogs?
[27:28.920 --> 27:29.700]  I don't know.
[27:29.760 --> 27:31.980]  You put them all facing up or down or whatever.
[27:32.120 --> 27:33.880]  And then like they all have to be facing the same way.
[27:33.980 --> 27:35.560]  Then you slam them like that.
[27:35.560 --> 27:37.460]  You'll stack them and then you slam them with the slammer.
[27:37.540 --> 27:39.800]  And then whatever ends up like the opposite way.
[27:39.900 --> 27:41.020]  Those are the ones that you win.
[27:41.680 --> 27:42.700]  Oh, weird.
[27:43.080 --> 27:46.000]  I, yeah, I mean, like, you know, I was born in the 80s, so.
[27:47.020 --> 27:50.840]  I made up for it by spending way more money to buy this.
[27:51.500 --> 27:53.240]  James Bond archives.
[27:53.440 --> 27:55.380]  These are actual baseball card or basketball card,
[27:55.500 --> 27:56.900]  baseball cards, collectible cards.
[27:57.400 --> 27:58.060]  God damn.
[27:59.980 --> 28:02.940]  These are basketball James Bond cards.
[28:03.300 --> 28:04.760]  So this is James Bond.
[28:05.160 --> 28:06.860]  He plays for the Denver Nuggets.
[28:08.680 --> 28:10.860]  He's a shooting guard in 6'2".
[28:13.040 --> 28:15.960]  He averages 44% from the mid-range.
[28:16.900 --> 28:20.760]  He's a 37% three-point shooter, 78% of the line.
[28:21.320 --> 28:24.540]  So I was able to get these James Bond archives cards for you, Gavin.
[28:24.940 --> 28:29.320]  So if you want to come over and open them here or I can open them for you.
[28:29.400 --> 28:30.400]  I don't know how you want to do that.
[28:30.420 --> 28:32.080]  I'll just watch. I can see on the calendar.
[28:32.080 --> 28:32.920]  These are for you, buddy.
[28:33.180 --> 28:33.680]  So let's...
[28:33.680 --> 28:34.340]  I think you should open one.
[28:34.680 --> 28:35.440]  Yeah, we got to open one.
[28:35.440 --> 28:36.780]  That way we're all ready.
[28:36.880 --> 28:37.480]  Before we do this, we got to...
[28:38.160 --> 28:38.960]  Oh, that's right.
[28:39.220 --> 28:40.380]  We got to donate to the pack sack.
[28:40.800 --> 28:41.460]  What's a sack pack?
[28:41.560 --> 28:43.680]  All right, I'll open these and I'll pass them to you.
[28:43.720 --> 28:44.360]  Okay, that's nice.
[28:44.480 --> 28:44.740]  Let's do that.
[28:45.260 --> 28:46.260]  That's nice. I like it.
[28:46.540 --> 28:48.380]  Don't worry. This is going to open. Here it comes.
[28:48.560 --> 28:51.360]  If the pogs didn't work, this is the moment you become addicted.
[28:51.600 --> 28:52.960]  And this might have an auto...
[28:52.960 --> 28:54.700]  Oh, these are like from new movies.
[28:55.880 --> 28:57.520]  Like the Quantum of Solace.
[28:57.720 --> 28:58.040]  Ooh.
[28:59.020 --> 29:00.160]  Dench. Can we have a dench pile?
[29:00.540 --> 29:01.820]  Yeah, we should do a dench pile.
[29:03.020 --> 29:05.100]  There's the woman who got painted with oil.
[29:05.440 --> 29:06.420]  Oh, the oil lady.
[29:06.500 --> 29:07.560]  That's cool.
[29:07.600 --> 29:12.140]  Oh, got a signed David Hedison who played old Felix.
[29:12.700 --> 29:14.160]  Oh, we got an auto, an old Felix.
[29:14.160 --> 29:14.820]  That's on card.
[29:15.520 --> 29:15.920]  Ooh.
[29:16.220 --> 29:17.100]  And a couple more...
[29:17.100 --> 29:18.160]  We got an old Felix auto.
[29:18.300 --> 29:20.520]  And a couple more denches, but not solo dench.
[29:20.540 --> 29:23.320]  I feel like the only denches worth stacking are the solo.
[29:23.400 --> 29:26.120]  I think we hang on to all the denches,
[29:26.260 --> 29:29.540]  and then when we have enough solo denches, we throw away the duo denches.
[29:29.620 --> 29:30.360]  I think that makes sense.
[29:30.360 --> 29:31.820]  And I'll have to go find the other dench.
[29:31.840 --> 29:33.360]  It's somewhere over there.
[29:34.000 --> 29:34.900]  Okay, I'll move.
[29:37.840 --> 29:40.860]  I keep thinking it's Mike, and I'm like, what's he doing?
[29:42.560 --> 29:45.040]  Oh, James Bond to the rescue.
[29:45.800 --> 29:47.500]  He's carrying a damsel in distress.
[29:47.620 --> 29:48.220]  Who's that that he's got?
[29:48.400 --> 29:49.300]  I don't know, it's sideways.
[29:51.060 --> 29:51.680]  There you go.
[29:52.680 --> 29:53.480]  What is...
[29:53.480 --> 29:54.060]  What's that from?
[29:54.260 --> 29:54.800]  He's like carrying that lady.
[29:54.820 --> 29:55.780]  Who's that woman behind him?
[29:56.180 --> 29:57.040]  She's on vacation.
[29:57.320 --> 29:58.340]  That's just behind-the-scenes footage.
[29:58.640 --> 29:59.980]  It's just Daniel Craig on holiday.
[30:01.420 --> 30:03.220]  There's these two classics.
[30:03.220 --> 30:04.110]  It's green and...
[30:04.680 --> 30:05.740]  No, I don't like that movie.
[30:06.220 --> 30:08.040]  Oh, Gavin, you're gonna love this.
[30:08.740 --> 30:09.060]  Boom.
[30:10.760 --> 30:11.100]  Dench!
[30:11.280 --> 30:11.960]  Full D!
[30:12.240 --> 30:13.240]  Wait, wait, wait.
[30:13.620 --> 30:14.540]  Where's the pogs?
[30:14.840 --> 30:16.050]  Is that the same...
[30:17.000 --> 30:17.820]  No, not that.
[30:18.400 --> 30:19.920]  No, yeah, the ones that you already have.
[30:20.020 --> 30:20.980]  There's a dench in here.
[30:21.240 --> 30:22.260]  I want to see if it's the same one.
[30:22.400 --> 30:24.120]  I needed to re-dench it anyway, so let's see.
[30:24.140 --> 30:25.440]  I needed to see if it was the same one.
[30:25.900 --> 30:26.560]  Let's see.
[30:26.740 --> 30:27.620]  There it is!
[30:28.240 --> 30:29.140]  It's the same one!
[30:29.140 --> 30:29.860]  Yes!
[30:30.440 --> 30:31.000]  Evil!
[30:31.140 --> 30:31.500]  Yes!
[30:32.140 --> 30:33.040]  That's awesome!
[30:33.460 --> 30:33.820]  Yes!
[30:35.200 --> 30:36.240]  Look at it!
[30:36.500 --> 30:37.520]  Look at it!
[30:37.980 --> 30:38.480]  Dude.
[30:38.740 --> 30:39.620]  Oh, my God.
[30:39.900 --> 30:42.020]  It's Dench with two different white balances.
[30:42.700 --> 30:47.280]  You have got yourself quite a little Judy Dench collection going, Gavin.
[30:47.280 --> 30:47.840]  That's awesome!
[30:47.980 --> 30:50.060]  All right, let's hear it for Dench.
[30:50.120 --> 30:50.880]  Oh, no, we're not done.
[30:52.880 --> 30:53.300]  We also got this bad boy.
[30:53.660 --> 30:55.220]  More solo Dench?
[30:55.320 --> 30:56.180]  Got another solo Dench.
[31:00.640 --> 31:01.400]  Got that one.
[31:01.480 --> 31:02.740]  Oh, there she is, covered in oil.
[31:02.880 --> 31:03.840]  We just saw her earlier.
[31:04.820 --> 31:05.900]  And then we got some...
[31:05.900 --> 31:06.860]  Ooh, a little Daniel Craig.
[31:07.440 --> 31:07.840]  All right.
[31:08.240 --> 31:09.840]  A bit quantum heavy, these.
[31:10.280 --> 31:10.820]  A little quantum heavy.
[31:10.820 --> 31:12.940]  Well, I think these are probably from, what, 2015?
[31:13.120 --> 31:14.480]  2015 edition, yeah.
[31:14.880 --> 31:16.740]  But it says archives, so I figure they'll be...
[31:16.740 --> 31:19.060]  Well, we had Old Tom or whatever that guy's name was.
[31:19.700 --> 31:20.460]  Let's see who else.
[31:20.460 --> 31:21.500]  What was his name?
[31:21.700 --> 31:22.120]  Old Tom.
[31:23.240 --> 31:23.960]  Old Felix?
[31:24.220 --> 31:24.920]  Oh, Old Felix.
[31:25.120 --> 31:25.320]  Yeah.
[31:25.560 --> 31:26.820]  He wasn't called Old Felix.
[31:27.020 --> 31:27.600]  He was just one of...
[31:27.600 --> 31:28.140]  Felix back then.
[31:28.140 --> 31:29.660]  Nine people who played Felix.
[31:30.080 --> 31:30.480]  There's something...
[31:30.480 --> 31:31.220]  Somebody shot somebody in that one.
[31:31.220 --> 31:31.360]  Oh, what's this?
[31:31.540 --> 31:31.800]  What's this?
[31:32.720 --> 31:33.300]  Looks like a...
[31:33.300 --> 31:34.160]  Let's see it.
[31:34.960 --> 31:35.360]  It...
[31:35.980 --> 31:36.880]  It looks like...
[31:36.880 --> 31:37.140]  Moonraker.
[31:37.520 --> 31:38.720]  Oh, yeah, it's a...
[31:39.260 --> 31:39.860]  Jaws shooting...
[31:39.860 --> 31:40.880]  Yeah, they're both Moonraker.
[31:41.020 --> 31:41.820]  That's Quantum again, isn't it?
[31:41.960 --> 31:42.820]  How about this one?
[31:43.080 --> 31:43.440]  Ooh.
[31:43.540 --> 31:43.700]  Wow.
[31:45.140 --> 31:45.540]  Wow.
[31:45.700 --> 31:46.920]  My favorite scene.
[31:47.120 --> 31:48.120]  Here's an action shot.
[31:48.220 --> 31:49.140]  This is gonna blow you away.
[31:50.200 --> 31:50.280]  Okay.
[31:50.480 --> 31:50.880]  Boom.
[31:51.560 --> 31:52.580]  Two guys by a fence.
[31:53.100 --> 31:53.900]  Oh, it's Quantum again.
[31:54.080 --> 31:54.380]  Hanging out.
[31:54.380 --> 31:55.840]  Not even from James Bond.
[31:55.980 --> 31:56.860]  Trying to order an Uber.
[31:57.500 --> 31:59.560]  It's just two guys by a fence.
[31:59.880 --> 32:02.120]  Oh, how about a little...
[32:02.120 --> 32:02.960]  Carl McChrystal.
[32:05.700 --> 32:06.660]  The world is not enough.
[32:06.660 --> 32:07.680]  The world is not enough.
[32:07.940 --> 32:09.200]  Who is Carl McChrystal?
[32:09.340 --> 32:10.200]  I don't know, but we got his autograph.
[32:10.660 --> 32:10.920]  Sick.
[32:10.980 --> 32:12.740]  It says congratulations on the other side.
[32:12.780 --> 32:13.140]  I feel congratulated.
[32:13.160 --> 32:14.000]  I wanna see the other side.
[32:14.080 --> 32:14.400]  What does it say?
[32:14.680 --> 32:17.880]  It says congratulations on having Carl McChrystal's autograph.
[32:17.960 --> 32:18.940]  He's truckin'.
[32:18.940 --> 32:19.740]  Who?
[32:20.760 --> 32:21.200]  Truckin'.
[32:21.740 --> 32:23.280]  Hey, keep on truckin'.
[32:23.280 --> 32:24.880]  Got my chips cashed in.
[32:24.880 --> 32:29.660]  Maybe he's the guy that checks Pierce Brosnan's shit when he's pretending to be the other guy.
[32:30.040 --> 32:31.080]  And then there's this guy?
[32:31.560 --> 32:34.020]  Yeah, that's the general Quantum guy.
[32:34.420 --> 32:38.380]  And then, Gavin, this one's gonna be, I hope, contain yourself a little bit.
[32:38.480 --> 32:41.560]  This is a little risque, but there's a dench in a...
[32:41.560 --> 32:42.380]  Dench in her office.
[32:42.580 --> 32:42.980]  Damn.
[32:43.140 --> 32:45.980]  In what appears to be some sort of a bathroom.
[32:46.980 --> 32:48.800]  Oh, is that in a house?
[32:49.840 --> 32:50.640]  From a long day.
[32:50.860 --> 32:51.960]  Carl McChrystal.
[32:52.600 --> 32:54.580]  I think this is a PSA rated 10.
[32:54.780 --> 32:57.860]  The world is not enough autographed card on eBay.
[32:58.960 --> 32:59.880]  $6.50.
[33:00.340 --> 33:00.600]  Boom.
[33:00.820 --> 33:01.460]  That's lunch.
[33:01.700 --> 33:02.220]  That's money.
[33:02.420 --> 33:04.080]  Plus $4.75 shipping.
[33:04.160 --> 33:04.820]  That's how they get you.
[33:04.960 --> 33:06.420]  They fuck you up for shipping and handling eBay.
[33:06.900 --> 33:08.320]  Alright, there's a...
[33:08.320 --> 33:09.680]  Nice head of hair on that Daniel Craig.
[33:09.720 --> 33:10.260]  Must be nice.
[33:10.860 --> 33:12.220]  We got this one.
[33:13.660 --> 33:14.120]  Classic.
[33:15.700 --> 33:16.860]  You're gonna love this.
[33:18.060 --> 33:18.520]  Boom.
[33:19.540 --> 33:21.520]  You can tell it's old because it's black and white.
[33:21.520 --> 33:22.540]  Ooh, Old Sean.
[33:22.740 --> 33:23.620]  Old Sean Connery.
[33:23.940 --> 33:25.300]  Potentially, you only live twice?
[33:25.660 --> 33:26.380]  Yeah, you only live twice.
[33:27.180 --> 33:28.580]  Then we got a...
[33:29.480 --> 33:30.640]  Dude's hanging around a board meeting.
[33:30.840 --> 33:31.800]  Oh, but there's Judy McShannery.
[33:31.860 --> 33:32.660]  In Apple's Dench.
[33:34.120 --> 33:35.900]  That's when Dench opened an Apple store.
[33:39.180 --> 33:42.060]  Oh, this nice action shot of Daniel Craig on a boat.
[33:42.400 --> 33:43.840]  Why do the Magic Caps...
[33:43.840 --> 33:46.060]  I just had this card in my Magic Caps collection.
[33:46.540 --> 33:47.960]  And it's in French?
[33:49.780 --> 33:51.420]  Uh, it is.
[33:51.620 --> 33:54.540]  It's telling me that I should buy Street Fighter 2 cards in French.
[33:54.860 --> 33:55.200]  Oh.
[33:56.840 --> 33:57.640]  So, um...
[33:57.640 --> 33:59.460]  Et means and, I think.
[33:59.760 --> 34:02.260]  Are Magic Caps off-brand Pogs or are they Pogs?
[34:02.900 --> 34:03.300]  I...
[34:03.300 --> 34:03.820]  I don't know.
[34:03.880 --> 34:05.020]  I bet that they're French Pogs.
[34:06.180 --> 34:06.560]  Got it.
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.160]  I found out that Pogs stands for Passion Orange Guava.
[34:10.400 --> 34:12.580]  Which was the juice and that was the cap that was underneath.
[34:12.820 --> 34:13.160]  Is that true?
[34:13.300 --> 34:13.500]  Yeah.
[34:13.980 --> 34:15.400]  I found out about that like yesterday.
[34:15.480 --> 34:17.740]  Do you know the former CFO of Rooster Teeth?
[34:18.660 --> 34:22.160]  Yvonne was like the CFO of Pogs back in the day.
[34:22.220 --> 34:22.960]  What the fuck?
[34:23.380 --> 34:23.500]  Yeah.
[34:23.720 --> 34:26.440]  It was like she was in charge of Pogs when it hit.
[34:26.600 --> 34:29.000]  She said it was like the most insane nine months of her life.
[34:29.100 --> 34:29.660]  That's right.
[34:30.600 --> 34:31.880]  Pogs are going crazy.
[34:32.560 --> 34:34.460]  This is never gonna end.
[34:35.480 --> 34:37.020]  We're gonna be Pogging forever.
[34:37.840 --> 34:39.100]  Then we got, uh...
[34:39.100 --> 34:43.920]  Oh, like Daniel Craig and some guy appear to be maybe looking for some real estate?
[34:44.240 --> 34:45.560]  Waterfront property, I guess?
[34:45.860 --> 34:46.580]  Is that Mathis?
[34:46.780 --> 34:47.080]  Yeah.
[34:47.080 --> 34:48.240]  It's so small.
[34:48.300 --> 34:49.800]  And then there's that one.
[34:50.160 --> 34:51.060]  It's bigger on your phone, you know.
[34:51.180 --> 34:51.640]  And then there's this.
[34:51.860 --> 34:52.340]  Oh!
[34:53.240 --> 34:53.900]  What we got?
[34:54.300 --> 34:55.340]  Well, you're gonna love this.
[34:55.440 --> 34:56.340]  Oh, my God.
[34:57.400 --> 34:57.880]  Wow!
[34:58.680 --> 35:02.800]  Oh, my God, it's Donald Pleasant as Blofeld.
[35:03.260 --> 35:06.440]  That is Dr. Loomis right there.
[35:07.400 --> 35:09.920]  You know a lot about James Bond.
[35:10.300 --> 35:11.120]  I've seen the films.
[35:11.240 --> 35:11.420]  Yeah.
[35:11.680 --> 35:14.940]  I know a lot about Halloween because he was Dr. Loomis in Halloween.
[35:15.060 --> 35:15.980]  That's pretty cool.
[35:15.980 --> 35:16.780]  No, it's not.
[35:17.280 --> 35:18.800]  Wasn't he in The Great Escape as well?
[35:19.200 --> 35:21.160]  Didn't they just announce a new Halloween movie?
[35:21.360 --> 35:21.700]  I don't know.
[35:21.720 --> 35:22.540]  I don't know a lot about Halloween.
[35:23.000 --> 35:24.560]  We got Daniel Craig and some lady.
[35:26.600 --> 35:27.020]  There you go.
[35:27.960 --> 35:28.320]  Wow.
[35:28.640 --> 35:29.360]  That's pre-Oil.
[35:29.520 --> 35:29.700]  Boom.
[35:30.100 --> 35:30.700]  Uh-oh.
[35:31.080 --> 35:31.800]  That's post-Oil.
[35:32.380 --> 35:32.860]  Post-Oil.
[35:35.280 --> 35:36.100]  Oh, are you gonna...
[35:36.100 --> 35:37.360]  Oh, you almost...
[35:37.360 --> 35:37.880]  I almost doubled up the rolling cards.
[35:37.880 --> 35:38.680]  Oh, that was close.
[35:38.860 --> 35:39.900]  I almost doubled it closer.
[35:40.360 --> 35:42.320]  That was almost a real expensive mistake.
[35:42.360 --> 35:42.960]  Yeah, yeah.
[35:43.080 --> 35:43.480]  Oh, baby.
[35:43.480 --> 35:44.800]  I'm gonna hold on to that one for the very end.
[35:44.800 --> 35:45.120]  Oh, man.
[35:45.500 --> 35:47.480]  I spent some dumb money.
[35:47.840 --> 35:52.540]  Okay, well, I think we're gonna take a break after this with these James Bond cards.
[35:52.660 --> 35:53.300]  But there's...
[35:53.300 --> 35:54.500]  Consider me engaged, though.
[35:54.640 --> 35:56.560]  Wow, look at his beautiful lips.
[35:56.720 --> 35:57.560]  Yeah, he seems...
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.780]  It's like they lit his lips with a separate light.
[36:01.120 --> 36:01.680]  I'm gonna save that.
[36:01.760 --> 36:02.220]  That's a good one.
[36:02.460 --> 36:04.240]  Then we got Lady Drives Car.
[36:04.420 --> 36:04.860]  Wow.
[36:05.720 --> 36:10.060]  And then I think Same Lady has different hair.
[36:10.060 --> 36:14.920]  The one where she's driving a car, if it didn't say 007, could be from literally any movie.
[36:15.240 --> 36:15.260]  Yes.
[36:15.400 --> 36:18.380]  You could have been like, this is actually from Transformers, and I would have believed you.
[36:18.500 --> 36:22.060]  Here's one where Daniel Craig points a gun at a wall.
[36:22.460 --> 36:22.620]  Fuck!
[36:22.620 --> 36:25.100]  Just in case the wall gets the ideas.
[36:25.320 --> 36:25.980]  Get down!
[36:26.560 --> 36:28.540]  Got some more fire action.
[36:29.200 --> 36:30.120]  That's just a mess.
[36:30.280 --> 36:30.560]  What is that?
[36:31.640 --> 36:32.040]  Uh-huh.
[36:32.360 --> 36:32.820]  Uh-oh.
[36:33.000 --> 36:33.740]  I like this one.
[36:34.000 --> 36:34.240]  Yeah?
[36:34.360 --> 36:34.960]  This is...
[36:34.960 --> 36:35.660]  How about that one?
[36:36.940 --> 36:38.140]  Riding on the private jet in style.
[36:38.140 --> 36:42.140]  Oh, dude, it's the guy from Stranger Things and the guy from Westworld.
[36:42.740 --> 36:45.620]  Yeah, it's David Harbour and, uh...
[36:45.620 --> 36:46.080]  Why is he...
[36:46.080 --> 36:46.780]  Geoffrey...
[36:47.200 --> 36:47.560]  Rush.
[36:47.760 --> 36:47.980]  Rush.
[36:49.180 --> 36:49.820]  Geoffrey Wright?
[36:49.900 --> 36:50.880]  Why is he sitting like this?
[36:50.880 --> 36:53.100]  Geoffrey Wright, who is his new Felix.
[36:53.480 --> 36:54.160]  He is new Felix.
[36:54.380 --> 36:56.960]  If we had a Geoffrey Wright autograph, that'd be way better than that.
[36:57.080 --> 36:57.980]  Well, there might be.
[36:58.060 --> 36:58.940]  There's a lot more cards in there.
[36:58.940 --> 36:59.420]  Here's what we're gonna do.
[36:59.660 --> 37:00.760]  We're gonna jump around.
[37:00.840 --> 37:02.020]  We're gonna open up this pack.
[37:02.180 --> 37:02.540]  Wow.
[37:02.640 --> 37:03.700]  And then we're gonna switch to something else.
[37:03.700 --> 37:05.340]  Right after you said we're gonna take a break, you...
[37:05.340 --> 37:08.020]  Well, I got excited about a Geoffrey Wright autograph.
[37:08.020 --> 37:09.260]  This is the power...
[37:09.260 --> 37:10.320]  This is the power of...
[37:10.320 --> 37:11.060]  Hit the button.
[37:13.340 --> 37:14.580]  Face breaks shit.
[37:14.860 --> 37:15.460]  Thank you.
[37:16.320 --> 37:17.040]  Got some more.
[37:17.140 --> 37:19.620]  Boy, Daniel Craig is really heavily featured in these.
[37:19.760 --> 37:19.980]  You guys are...
[37:19.980 --> 37:22.300]  In the James Bond collection?
[37:22.580 --> 37:22.660]  Yeah.
[37:22.780 --> 37:23.880]  Pointing at the, uh...
[37:23.880 --> 37:25.100]  There was a few James Bonds.
[37:25.160 --> 37:25.760]  He wasn't the only one.
[37:26.380 --> 37:26.620]  What?
[37:27.080 --> 37:29.740]  This is the reverse angle from him pointing at that wall.
[37:30.400 --> 37:31.780]  This is the wall?
[37:31.840 --> 37:32.420]  Yeah, that's the wall.
[37:32.860 --> 37:34.420]  This is from the wall's perspective.
[37:36.120 --> 37:37.020]  We'll put that there.
[37:38.400 --> 37:39.040]  Craigie again.
[37:39.140 --> 37:39.800]  Mm-hmm.
[37:39.800 --> 37:40.720]  I'm gonna grab that wall.
[37:41.140 --> 37:41.940]  Put those together.
[37:42.040 --> 37:42.460]  Yeah, it's good.
[37:42.660 --> 37:43.560]  Uh, let's see.
[37:43.660 --> 37:45.000]  Oh, remember when he got out of that van?
[37:46.520 --> 37:49.260]  The only one I remember is when he gets out of the ocean.
[37:49.720 --> 37:52.640]  I remember when he gets out of the ocean in Casino Royale and he's, like, walking like this.
[37:52.720 --> 37:52.860]  Yeah.
[37:52.960 --> 37:53.480]  Oh, here we go.
[37:53.580 --> 37:54.680]  Tough guys in short pants.
[37:54.840 --> 37:55.440]  Gotta love that.
[37:55.740 --> 37:56.280]  Sensual ape.
[37:56.900 --> 37:57.600]  Whoa, cool.
[37:57.640 --> 37:58.120]  Oh, that's...
[37:58.120 --> 37:59.220]  That's when he went in the pipe.
[38:00.260 --> 38:00.900]  That's awesome.
[38:01.360 --> 38:02.680]  Oh, is that when they fished his body out?
[38:02.820 --> 38:04.740]  Yeah, I think that's after he, uh, pretended to die in one of the fights.
[38:04.740 --> 38:05.260]  That's really cool.
[38:05.360 --> 38:06.900]  The higher the socks, the downer the fool.
[38:06.900 --> 38:07.780]  Here he is right here.
[38:07.840 --> 38:08.380]  He's, like...
[38:08.380 --> 38:09.540]  He's got a martini glass in his hand.
[38:09.620 --> 38:10.980]  He's, like, shake it, no, it's good.
[38:11.060 --> 38:11.640]  He's finished it.
[38:11.820 --> 38:12.320]  He wants another.
[38:12.620 --> 38:13.860]  Give me another one.
[38:14.000 --> 38:14.800]  Twelve more of those.
[38:14.800 --> 38:15.620]  Whoa, he looks a lot...
[38:15.620 --> 38:16.320]  He's got, like...
[38:16.320 --> 38:16.860]  That looks like...
[38:16.860 --> 38:17.720]  He's, like, a skull.
[38:18.720 --> 38:19.040]  Oh!
[38:19.460 --> 38:20.840]  He's got a real skull there.
[38:20.900 --> 38:21.600]  You got Depog.
[38:21.820 --> 38:22.640]  That's pretty cool.
[38:24.180 --> 38:25.020]  These are all numbered.
[38:25.340 --> 38:25.540]  Neat.
[38:25.560 --> 38:25.800]  Yeah.
[38:25.920 --> 38:27.240]  That's a lot of just a helicopter.
[38:27.400 --> 38:27.580]  Yeah.
[38:29.220 --> 38:30.700]  Uh, then there's the picture of that lady.
[38:30.900 --> 38:31.520]  And then we're done.
[38:31.880 --> 38:32.020]  Okay.
[38:32.540 --> 38:35.120]  You could have said that was from the transporter, and I would have been like, yep.
[38:35.120 --> 38:36.560]  So we've got our Dinch pile.
[38:36.740 --> 38:36.860]  Uh-huh.
[38:36.960 --> 38:38.440]  We've got our other New Hits pile over here.
[38:38.440 --> 38:41.080]  That's when he slid down that thing that doesn't exist anymore.
[38:41.080 --> 38:41.180]  That's when he slid down the thing that doesn't exist anymore.
[38:41.240 --> 38:42.840]  I do remember that.
[38:43.020 --> 38:43.720]  What happened to that thing?
[38:43.800 --> 38:44.120]  Where'd it go?
[38:44.180 --> 38:45.540]  It fell down this year, I think.
[38:45.640 --> 38:46.740]  I think it was, like, last year?
[38:46.920 --> 38:47.340]  Last year.
[38:47.840 --> 38:50.480]  The whole, like, thing caved in on the dish.
[38:50.680 --> 38:50.860]  Yep.
[38:51.420 --> 38:55.240]  There was video of it, because there was just, like, a camera pointed at it, and it was just, like...
[38:55.240 --> 38:56.600]  Just on its own, it fell down?
[38:56.660 --> 38:57.800]  Yeah, like the big triangle thing.
[38:57.800 --> 38:57.920]  Yep.
[38:57.960 --> 38:58.680]  It was like...
[38:59.140 --> 39:00.260]  Were they expecting that to happen?
[39:00.260 --> 39:01.840]  Yeah, because it was all, like...
[39:01.840 --> 39:02.180]  Gammy?
[39:02.180 --> 39:04.720]  Yeah, like, rusty and collapsy.
[39:04.740 --> 39:06.700]  Oh, you denched the, uh...
[39:06.700 --> 39:08.820]  I just saw you dench the top of that card.
[39:11.220 --> 39:11.940]  All right.
[39:12.040 --> 39:13.920]  What should we open next?
[39:14.120 --> 39:14.600]  Bolo Rama.
[39:14.820 --> 39:16.020]  Dude, a shiny bean, though.
[39:16.200 --> 39:16.420]  That's a good one.
[39:16.420 --> 39:17.420]  Shiny bean's pretty good.
[39:17.520 --> 39:17.740]  Nice.
[39:17.820 --> 39:19.060]  We should see if we get a handful of beans.
[39:19.260 --> 39:21.160]  I want to see what's up with this...
[39:21.600 --> 39:24.140]  Andrew's favorite thing, the Fred Flintstone Bolo Rama Fred.
[39:24.960 --> 39:26.520]  Oh, we're gonna get another Twinkle Toes Fred?
[39:26.860 --> 39:27.400]  What is it?
[39:27.420 --> 39:28.180]  Take a look at it.
[39:28.260 --> 39:29.660]  It is a...
[39:29.660 --> 39:30.100]  What do you mean?
[39:30.200 --> 39:30.960]  You said this was...
[39:30.960 --> 39:32.680]  You said this was, like, the thing we should do.
[39:32.960 --> 39:34.160]  Make him bowl a Strike-a-roonie.
[39:34.280 --> 39:36.040]  Here, why don't you play around with that and see what's up?
[39:36.140 --> 39:37.320]  Am I okay to open this, Andrew?
[39:37.420 --> 39:37.980]  Yeah, well...
[39:37.980 --> 39:38.560]  Yeah, of course!
[39:38.740 --> 39:38.980]  Okay.
[39:39.480 --> 39:40.640]  I like the cover...
[39:40.640 --> 39:41.960]  Can we show the cover of this real quick?
[39:42.040 --> 39:43.020]  Just his face and stuff?
[39:43.220 --> 39:44.680]  Because I really like these monkeys.
[39:45.300 --> 39:46.380]  They're having a good time.
[39:46.460 --> 39:47.760]  They can't believe what's...
[39:47.760 --> 39:48.880]  This one is...
[39:48.880 --> 39:50.740]  They're doing the see-no-speak-no-whatever.
[39:50.980 --> 39:52.000]  But he's...
[39:52.000 --> 39:52.960]  But he's...
[39:55.680 --> 39:56.980]  You know what else is kind of cool?
[39:58.040 --> 39:59.060]  No, go back to that shot, please.
[39:59.720 --> 40:01.040]  You can kind of see it in this skirt.
[40:01.540 --> 40:02.380]  Oh, baby!
[40:03.160 --> 40:04.020]  Now we're talking.
[40:04.180 --> 40:05.000]  You can see his boulders.
[40:05.120 --> 40:05.700]  Thanks, Fred.
[40:07.160 --> 40:08.080]  Also, it's in a Strike.
[40:08.180 --> 40:09.100]  There's three pins.
[40:10.440 --> 40:11.260]  Well, the other ones...
[40:11.260 --> 40:13.240]  The other ones, like, blew away.
[40:13.360 --> 40:15.000]  Because he bowled it so hard.
[40:15.120 --> 40:17.000]  You think they had ten pins when they invented bowling?
[40:17.200 --> 40:18.640]  They probably started with three.
[40:19.180 --> 40:20.340]  There's a pin symbol.
[40:20.560 --> 40:22.480]  Gavin, over there, I think it's...
[40:22.480 --> 40:24.780]  To your right, I think there's some Battlefield Earth cards.
[40:25.240 --> 40:26.120]  Oh, we're doing those again?
[40:26.260 --> 40:28.460]  We never finished them, so I thought we could...
[40:28.460 --> 40:30.220]  We could keep going for our...
[40:30.220 --> 40:31.380]  I was doing an Eric and looking over there.
[40:31.640 --> 40:32.800]  We could keep going for our...
[40:32.800 --> 40:34.460]  What was it, a Barry Pepper autograph we were looking for?
[40:35.000 --> 40:35.620]  Forrest Whitaker.
[40:35.820 --> 40:37.020]  Oh, Forrest Whitaker, that's right.
[40:37.360 --> 40:39.320]  So we'll blow through a couple of these guys.
[40:40.300 --> 40:41.540]  Is that the same box?
[40:41.700 --> 40:43.080]  It's the same box, we never finished it.
[40:43.440 --> 40:44.400]  Let me throw...
[40:44.400 --> 40:45.240]  Pack in the sack.
[40:46.420 --> 40:47.600]  I haven't found a Q.
[40:47.800 --> 40:48.980]  Why is Q on all these pulls?
[40:49.000 --> 40:49.860]  Not easy to find, dude.
[40:49.880 --> 40:50.720]  Isn't he dead at that point?
[40:51.500 --> 40:51.860]  Q?
[40:52.220 --> 40:54.480]  Yeah, so we're looking for a Forrest Whitaker autograph.
[40:54.660 --> 40:55.460]  Any autograph, really.
[40:55.820 --> 40:57.320]  But there's a Barry Pepper card.
[40:58.060 --> 40:59.380]  For more of those discs?
[40:59.560 --> 41:00.760]  You got one of those media discs?
[41:00.940 --> 41:02.120]  Oh, the media discs, yeah.
[41:02.160 --> 41:03.140]  We got two of those last time.
[41:03.140 --> 41:04.000]  Mike's laptop bag.
[41:08.020 --> 41:08.740]  I, uh...
[41:10.820 --> 41:11.180]  What?
[41:11.640 --> 41:12.460]  Yeah, there's gotta be...
[41:12.460 --> 41:13.780]  There has to be more to that.
[41:14.380 --> 41:15.040]  No, I don't know.
[41:15.100 --> 41:15.800]  I don't know what's going on with that.
[41:17.640 --> 41:19.940]  You do this professionally.
[41:20.220 --> 41:20.520]  Yeah.
[41:21.920 --> 41:23.000]  That's why I'm going to stop.
[41:25.160 --> 41:26.040]  It wasn't going anywhere.
[41:26.040 --> 41:26.900]  What was the point?
[41:28.460 --> 41:29.080]  The end.
[41:30.500 --> 41:32.300]  It's better in person than it is on Discord.
[41:32.480 --> 41:33.660]  At least we know he didn't drop.
[41:34.820 --> 41:35.900]  By the way...
[41:35.900 --> 41:37.100]  No one's pranking you. It's fine.
[41:37.200 --> 41:39.020]  I got some exciting stuff for you.
[41:39.180 --> 41:39.560]  For me?
[41:39.780 --> 41:40.620]  I'm already playing.
[41:41.040 --> 41:44.020]  James bonded more than Fred Flintstone.
[41:44.280 --> 41:45.740]  James bonded you as well.
[41:46.600 --> 41:46.720]  So...
[41:46.720 --> 41:47.680]  You've engaged Eric.
[41:49.180 --> 41:49.700]  There's Fred.
[41:50.080 --> 41:51.520]  Oh, he's to get the Water Buffaloes shirt on.
[41:51.560 --> 41:52.100]  That's awesome.
[41:52.320 --> 41:52.480]  Yeah.
[41:52.640 --> 41:53.000]  Loyal order.
[41:54.380 --> 41:55.140]  Still no...
[41:56.180 --> 41:56.820]  Forest Whitaker.
[41:57.880 --> 41:58.520]  Boy, these...
[41:58.520 --> 41:59.160]  Suck?
[41:59.280 --> 42:00.860]  These Battlefield Earth cards are really trash.
[42:01.300 --> 42:02.100]  Yeah, they're terrible.
[42:02.400 --> 42:03.000]  They smell awful.
[42:03.000 --> 42:04.160]  Yeah, it's weird because the movie...
[42:04.160 --> 42:04.880]  They don't smell good.
[42:04.900 --> 42:08.400]  It's like the movie's so good, you would think these would be like fucking bangers.
[42:08.460 --> 42:09.220]  You know, I gotta be honest.
[42:09.360 --> 42:11.040]  I never saw the movie.
[42:11.700 --> 42:12.020]  Really?
[42:12.180 --> 42:12.780]  Yeah, I've never seen it.
[42:12.800 --> 42:14.420]  Not even as like a, hey, let's like...
[42:14.420 --> 42:14.880]  As a joke?
[42:14.960 --> 42:15.200]  Yeah.
[42:15.340 --> 42:16.060]  I've never seen it either.
[42:16.160 --> 42:19.460]  Not even as one of the world's biggest Forest Whitaker fans.
[42:19.560 --> 42:21.200]  You do get the gist of it.
[42:21.860 --> 42:23.200]  You get the gist of it really fast.
[42:23.240 --> 42:24.820]  And then you realize how much more movie there is.
[42:24.820 --> 42:25.640]  And you go, oh boy.
[42:26.020 --> 42:28.240]  Well, the problem is Battlefield Earth, right?
[42:28.260 --> 42:30.360]  Like, I was a fan of Mission Earth.
[42:30.500 --> 42:31.580]  The technology he wrote.
[42:31.740 --> 42:32.820]  And Battlefield Earth...
[42:33.420 --> 42:35.020]  I don't know, something about it just turned me off.
[42:35.120 --> 42:35.820]  It was, uh...
[42:36.720 --> 42:39.060]  Same story, same universe, but not a comedy or some shit.
[42:39.180 --> 42:39.400]  I don't know.
[42:39.440 --> 42:40.180]  Same writer?
[42:40.600 --> 42:41.280]  Yeah, same writer.
[42:41.320 --> 42:41.840]  Same Elrond?
[42:42.060 --> 42:42.440]  Same Elrond.
[42:42.720 --> 42:43.640]  I was not expecting this.
[42:45.140 --> 42:46.160]  Fred has the hat.
[42:46.660 --> 42:47.240]  That's pretty nice.
[42:47.280 --> 42:47.580]  Oh, shit.
[42:47.900 --> 42:48.120]  Dude.
[42:48.800 --> 42:49.600]  I got real excited.
[42:49.680 --> 42:50.900]  I thought I had a fat pack to open up.
[42:51.020 --> 42:51.180]  Yeah.
[42:51.220 --> 42:52.060]  I thought maybe there'd be a relic.
[42:52.220 --> 42:52.940]  It was...
[42:53.620 --> 42:54.640]  Oh, sick!
[42:55.040 --> 42:58.340]  I'm about 20 packets in and I've got no slammer yet.
[42:58.820 --> 43:00.380]  Just thought I'd give you an update.
[43:01.860 --> 43:02.740]  Gavin is...
[43:02.740 --> 43:03.080]  Okay.
[43:03.300 --> 43:03.620]  Addicted.
[43:03.980 --> 43:04.240]  Okay.
[43:04.380 --> 43:05.040]  That's how it starts.
[43:05.380 --> 43:05.660]  Okay.
[43:05.820 --> 43:07.100]  There's a lot of berry pepper cards.
[43:07.360 --> 43:07.720]  Oh, dude.
[43:07.860 --> 43:09.020]  Can you actually do the bowling?
[43:10.640 --> 43:14.460]  I think the most interesting thing about Battlefield Earth is it's like a religious movie, right?
[43:14.800 --> 43:15.120]  Like it's...
[43:15.120 --> 43:15.300]  Yeah.
[43:15.540 --> 43:16.980]  To honor his religion.
[43:17.260 --> 43:17.660]  Move those cards.
[43:17.680 --> 43:20.340]  And everyone on the set got converted to Scientology by Travolta.
[43:20.360 --> 43:21.800]  Okay, so let's go to the jib shot.
[43:22.200 --> 43:22.880]  Another bean.
[43:23.140 --> 43:23.800]  There we go.
[43:24.280 --> 43:35.720]  So now what we have here, Water Buffalo Fred, where you can cock his arm back and have him bowl the way he would normally.
[43:35.720 --> 43:36.060]  Arama.
[43:36.340 --> 43:36.540]  Yep.
[43:36.840 --> 43:37.660]  The monkeys are here.
[43:37.860 --> 43:38.040]  Wait.
[43:38.280 --> 43:39.220]  Can you put the monkeys down?
[43:39.500 --> 43:40.500]  Oh, my God.
[43:40.680 --> 43:41.340]  All right, Geoff.
[43:41.580 --> 43:41.980]  Geoff.
[43:42.120 --> 43:42.500]  Is it me?
[43:42.680 --> 43:42.900]  Yeah.
[43:42.960 --> 43:45.480]  I want you to do a little Fred bowling.
[43:45.680 --> 43:47.040]  He's got a little switch on the back.
[43:47.180 --> 43:47.460]  All right.
[43:47.880 --> 43:48.740]  I'm gonna do it like Fred.
[43:48.900 --> 43:49.120]  Yep.
[43:49.120 --> 43:50.380]  Oh, he's at Fred.
[43:50.600 --> 43:52.200]  Yabba-dabba-doo!
[43:54.600 --> 43:55.640]  Fred's a rooney!
[43:56.700 --> 43:57.480]  It may...
[43:57.480 --> 43:58.320]  All right.
[43:59.300 --> 44:01.780]  I'm gonna try to pick up the spare.
[44:01.960 --> 44:02.660]  I'm gonna try to pick up the spare.
[44:02.780 --> 44:03.180]  Here it goes.
[44:04.500 --> 44:06.340]  Yabba-dabba-doo!
[44:07.080 --> 44:07.960]  It's a rooney!
[44:11.060 --> 44:12.140]  All right, we'll get a little closer.
[44:14.200 --> 44:15.980]  Maybe I just hit it.
[44:16.300 --> 44:16.740]  Yeah!
[44:17.360 --> 44:18.040]  I only got two.
[44:19.160 --> 44:20.000]  Well, there you go.
[44:20.040 --> 44:20.660]  There's Fred.
[44:21.760 --> 44:23.080]  Thanks for making me buy that.
[44:24.280 --> 44:25.320]  He just said...
[44:25.320 --> 44:26.740]  I don't know if you heard him, Andrew.
[44:27.140 --> 44:29.620]  He just said, thanks for making me buy that.
[44:29.840 --> 44:29.960]  Yeah.
[44:30.660 --> 44:31.300]  No, I didn't.
[44:31.480 --> 44:32.560]  I couldn't hear over the applause.
[44:33.120 --> 44:33.480]  It's...
[44:33.480 --> 44:34.360]  You're welcome, Geoff.
[44:34.600 --> 44:35.400]  Oh, was that too...
[44:35.400 --> 44:35.580]  You loved it.
[44:35.660 --> 44:36.500]  Was that too loud, Andrew?
[44:36.540 --> 44:36.880]  I'm sorry.
[44:36.940 --> 44:39.760]  Whenever you do the sound effects, Kevin, it blows out of my head.
[44:39.760 --> 44:40.300]  It is great.
[44:40.560 --> 44:40.920]  People...
[44:40.920 --> 44:43.420]  The crowd went nuts for that bowlerama segment.
[44:43.460 --> 44:44.100]  Oh, man.
[44:46.260 --> 44:46.980]  The bowlerama...
[44:47.920 --> 44:48.700]  How was that one?
[44:49.120 --> 44:50.640]  That was aimed at Geoff, I assume.
[44:53.100 --> 44:56.660]  Here, I'm going to open up a couple more of these dog shit Battle for Earth packs.
[44:56.760 --> 44:57.080]  Those are rough.
[44:57.380 --> 44:59.580]  And then we're going to move on to anything else.
[44:59.940 --> 45:00.400]  You weren't kidding.
[45:00.480 --> 45:00.960]  These are rough.
[45:01.260 --> 45:07.000]  Remember all these scenes of dudes with alien makeup doing alien... just staring at shit?
[45:07.720 --> 45:08.100]  That was all.
[45:08.480 --> 45:09.360]  Yeah, I mean, that was...
[45:09.360 --> 45:11.620]  What you've just described is, I think, the whole movie.
[45:11.700 --> 45:13.100]  Did anything happen in this film?
[45:13.180 --> 45:13.800]  No, not really.
[45:14.020 --> 45:16.560]  It's like people trying to escape stuff and it's just like...
[45:16.560 --> 45:18.960]  Everything's like a Dutch angle and ugly to look at.
[45:19.540 --> 45:23.800]  It's like, you know, like watching Gummo where you just go, I don't want to look at this.
[45:24.580 --> 45:25.560]  That's Battlefield Earth.
[45:26.000 --> 45:27.300]  Battlefield Earth is like Gummo?
[45:28.140 --> 45:33.500]  It gives me the same feeling of just like, I don't want to like physically view this.
[45:33.640 --> 45:34.580]  Like, I can't look at this.
[45:34.620 --> 45:36.920]  There are surely some shots that aren't on a Dutch angle.
[45:36.940 --> 45:37.540]  There are some.
[45:37.600 --> 45:42.060]  If you took all of those shots out and watched only those, how long would the movie be?
[45:42.060 --> 45:42.980]  I want to... I don't know.
[45:43.060 --> 45:44.940]  I want to re-edit it and undutch the angles.
[45:45.120 --> 45:47.080]  Punch in just a little bit and then go, normal.
[45:47.840 --> 45:50.500]  But what if he's like doing it in camera?
[45:50.660 --> 45:51.700]  You got... then you...
[45:51.700 --> 45:52.220]  You have to like compensate.
[45:52.220 --> 45:53.080]  You pick a track point.
[45:53.340 --> 45:53.680]  You have to keep it.
[45:55.220 --> 45:56.340]  Alright, here's what we're going to do.
[45:56.620 --> 45:59.380]  We're running low on these fucking Battlefield cards.
[45:59.500 --> 46:00.420]  I'm just going to burn through these.
[46:00.600 --> 46:02.380]  And then we're just going to get through them.
[46:02.580 --> 46:03.440]  And then they're gone.
[46:03.480 --> 46:05.140]  We're running low on these Battlefield cards.
[46:05.520 --> 46:08.060]  Yeah, there's one or two in the pack sack.
[46:08.480 --> 46:10.080]  And that's where they will remain.
[46:11.200 --> 46:13.380]  I'm just going to blow through these final packs.
[46:13.520 --> 46:14.320]  How many packs are there?
[46:14.480 --> 46:15.400]  There's like five here.
[46:15.740 --> 46:16.800]  I'll put the other two in the pack sack.
[46:16.800 --> 46:18.080]  Did you get a slammer yet?
[46:18.560 --> 46:18.820]  No.
[46:19.280 --> 46:19.600]  Really?
[46:19.780 --> 46:19.980]  I'm working on it.
[46:20.700 --> 46:21.500]  I've got a lot of packs.
[46:21.800 --> 46:23.940]  I hope you don't mind me opening every single one of these.
[46:24.060 --> 46:24.920]  Well, that's what they're here for, buddy.
[46:24.960 --> 46:25.200]  Okay.
[46:26.020 --> 46:27.900]  Look, here's another shot of a dude looking at a thing.
[46:28.360 --> 46:29.480]  Here's two people talking.
[46:29.580 --> 46:31.120]  It's like pretty easy to be the middle.
[46:31.900 --> 46:32.580]  There's a thing.
[46:33.380 --> 46:34.640]  What's the... I can't see anything.
[46:35.200 --> 46:35.920]  You're not missing...
[46:35.920 --> 46:37.360]  Gavin, I don't think you're missing anything.
[46:37.360 --> 46:37.900]  I think I am.
[46:38.020 --> 46:38.800]  I don't have any of that...
[46:38.800 --> 46:39.580]  Okay, there you go.
[46:39.820 --> 46:40.340]  There you go.
[46:40.400 --> 46:41.020]  Yeah, here we go.
[46:41.060 --> 46:43.120]  Okay, we're going to rapid fire these ugly guys right now.
[46:43.260 --> 46:44.880]  Someone stabilize these guys.
[46:44.880 --> 46:45.860]  Look at that.
[46:46.040 --> 46:47.220]  What is in his nose?
[46:47.380 --> 46:49.440]  There's an art card, gallery.
[46:50.200 --> 46:50.920]  That's trash.
[46:51.060 --> 46:52.600]  There's probably, like, a lot of lore.
[46:52.920 --> 46:55.140]  That's the tunnel he lives in, I guess, probably.
[46:56.080 --> 46:56.700]  I don't know.
[46:57.080 --> 46:58.360]  Not what he's escaping through.
[46:58.500 --> 46:59.300]  The tunnel he lives in.
[46:59.320 --> 47:00.660]  What's he doing at that point in the movie?
[47:00.880 --> 47:01.760]  He's looking down.
[47:01.880 --> 47:02.540]  That's all he does.
[47:02.760 --> 47:04.120]  He looks that way or he looks to the left.
[47:04.780 --> 47:05.480]  Another one...
[47:05.480 --> 47:05.820]  There they are.
[47:05.860 --> 47:06.380]  There's the people.
[47:07.060 --> 47:07.680]  Then there's that.
[47:07.960 --> 47:09.520]  It looks like Planet of the Apes, sort of.
[47:09.580 --> 47:11.180]  It is very much...
[47:11.180 --> 47:11.880]  Yeah, very much feels like that.
[47:11.880 --> 47:12.940]  These have all been leveled.
[47:13.260 --> 47:14.220]  They're all perfectly leveled.
[47:14.220 --> 47:14.560]  They are.
[47:14.780 --> 47:15.100]  It's true.
[47:16.460 --> 47:17.180]  Look, here's...
[47:17.180 --> 47:18.640]  Oh, this is an exciting one.
[47:21.440 --> 47:21.800]  Oh!
[47:22.500 --> 47:22.860]  Oh!
[47:23.200 --> 47:24.340]  I'm going to save this one for last.
[47:24.520 --> 47:24.920]  Oh, okay.
[47:25.340 --> 47:28.400]  Well, now, this is the first card I've gotten from Battlefield Earth that I quite like.
[47:28.460 --> 47:28.660]  Okay.
[47:28.900 --> 47:30.440]  So I'm going to save this one.
[47:30.580 --> 47:31.000]  I'm going to make this a hit.
[47:31.600 --> 47:33.300]  I am a huge Forest Whitaker fan.
[47:33.780 --> 47:34.140]  Okay.
[47:34.160 --> 47:34.980]  I don't know if you know that about me.
[47:35.220 --> 47:38.560]  But that's easily the best Forest Whitaker card I've ever seen.
[47:40.480 --> 47:43.340]  I take back every bad thing I said about the Battlefield Earth cards
[47:43.340 --> 47:44.280]  because that is gorgeous.
[47:44.500 --> 47:45.460]  Look at those shoulders.
[47:45.860 --> 47:46.240]  He's got...
[47:46.240 --> 47:47.560]  He is poured into that costume.
[47:47.640 --> 47:49.660]  He's got hair like Garrett from Mega64.
[47:51.500 --> 47:56.840]  That is Mega64's Garrett in 20 years of hamburgers.
[47:56.940 --> 47:57.100]  Yeah, uh-huh.
[47:57.160 --> 47:58.400]  Yeah, there you go.
[47:58.520 --> 48:00.000]  Well, did we get through all those ugly-ass cards?
[48:00.020 --> 48:00.560]  We got through...
[48:00.560 --> 48:01.420]  I put the rest in the thing.
[48:02.080 --> 48:02.920]  All right, what's the next...
[48:02.920 --> 48:03.720]  What are we doing next?
[48:03.940 --> 48:04.260]  Well...
[48:04.260 --> 48:05.360]  Gavin still doesn't have a slammer.
[48:05.620 --> 48:06.320]  I'm working on it, dude.
[48:06.560 --> 48:07.180]  Simply Pogs.
[48:07.200 --> 48:07.700]  What do you want from me?
[48:07.840 --> 48:08.560]  I'm going to do...
[48:08.560 --> 48:08.780]  A slammer.
[48:09.180 --> 48:09.500]  Okay.
[48:09.500 --> 48:10.960]  Here's what I got for you.
[48:11.100 --> 48:12.180]  Here's what I got for us.
[48:12.220 --> 48:13.100]  Eric, I got something for you.
[48:13.160 --> 48:13.520]  How about that?
[48:13.580 --> 48:13.780]  Okay.
[48:14.240 --> 48:15.540]  I bought these online recently.
[48:15.760 --> 48:16.000]  Yeah.
[48:16.200 --> 48:19.540]  I told you about some other stuff I bought for you, but I didn't tell you about...
[48:20.400 --> 48:20.800]  Boom.
[48:23.380 --> 48:25.520]  WCW World Champion Wrestling.
[48:25.640 --> 48:26.720]  Official trading cards.
[48:27.040 --> 48:28.500]  Is the WCW still around?
[48:28.660 --> 48:29.280]  Absolutely not.
[48:29.560 --> 48:31.460]  This is from 1991...
[48:31.460 --> 48:33.040]  That's the 91-92 NWA.
[48:33.120 --> 48:34.380]  1991 to 12.
[48:34.980 --> 48:36.120]  91 to 1-2.
[48:36.360 --> 48:36.680]  Uh-huh.
[48:36.680 --> 48:41.160]  So what we're going to have in here is probably a lot of...
[48:41.720 --> 48:44.060]  Ric Flair, Arne Anderson, Legion...
[48:44.060 --> 48:45.140]  Not the Legion of Doom.
[48:45.440 --> 48:46.420]  Just the team Doom.
[48:47.140 --> 48:49.480]  Ron Simmons and Hacksaw Butch Reed.
[48:49.880 --> 48:52.640]  We're probably going to see a lot of the Freebirds.
[48:53.780 --> 48:54.920]  Not the Von Eriks.
[48:55.280 --> 49:00.280]  Do you think we'll see Manny Fernandez, the Flying Burrito, or Dusty Rhodes?
[49:00.420 --> 49:00.700]  Manny...
[49:00.700 --> 49:03.060]  At this time, no Manny Fernandez.
[49:03.740 --> 49:05.060]  He was my favorite wrestler when I was a kid.
[49:05.100 --> 49:05.600]  That's pretty cool.
[49:05.600 --> 49:07.340]  Probably no Dusty Rhodes.
[49:07.480 --> 49:10.480]  No, because he was in WWF right around that time, I think.
[49:10.760 --> 49:11.500]  So who we got?
[49:11.640 --> 49:12.760]  We got the Southern Boys.
[49:13.340 --> 49:13.700]  Let's see.
[49:13.860 --> 49:14.260]  Oh!
[49:14.520 --> 49:15.400]  Is that a...
[49:15.400 --> 49:16.800]  It's um...
[49:16.800 --> 49:17.360]  Uh...
[49:17.360 --> 49:18.120]  Fucking...
[49:18.120 --> 49:19.420]  Does the deal...
[49:19.420 --> 49:20.600]  One of the Southern Boys.
[49:20.620 --> 49:21.020]  Just passed.
[49:21.360 --> 49:22.580]  Oh, he's killing me.
[49:22.820 --> 49:22.920]  Yeah.
[49:23.180 --> 49:24.000]  I can't think of his name.
[49:24.080 --> 49:24.760]  Sid Vicious.
[49:25.040 --> 49:25.520]  Oh, hell.
[49:25.600 --> 49:26.160]  I remember him.
[49:26.200 --> 49:26.680]  Hell yeah.
[49:26.780 --> 49:27.440]  Everybody hated him.
[49:27.520 --> 49:27.820]  He was a bad guy.
[49:28.440 --> 49:29.280]  And then you were right.
[49:29.600 --> 49:31.740]  There is the Nature Boy, Ric Flair.
[49:32.480 --> 49:33.580]  The Nature Boy.
[49:33.580 --> 49:35.220]  Here's another Southern Boy.
[49:35.660 --> 49:36.140]  Hell yeah.
[49:36.480 --> 49:37.720]  Do you remember...
[49:37.720 --> 49:40.320]  Do you remember Missy Hyatt?
[49:40.600 --> 49:41.060]  Hell yeah.
[49:41.680 --> 49:42.320]  She's still around.
[49:42.720 --> 49:43.480]  Tracy Smothers.
[49:43.780 --> 49:44.660]  Couldn't think of the T-S.
[49:44.740 --> 49:45.500]  He just passed.
[49:45.660 --> 49:46.820]  Oh, she's one of the Smothers sisters.
[49:47.000 --> 49:47.420]  No, no.
[49:47.480 --> 49:49.680]  Tracy Smothers is one of the Southern Boys.
[49:49.880 --> 49:50.660]  She's one of the sisters.
[49:51.140 --> 49:52.140]  His name is Tracy Smothers.
[49:52.320 --> 49:53.320]  You remember the Smothers brothers?
[49:53.500 --> 49:53.920]  They had sisters.
[49:54.180 --> 49:59.580]  So he was in the Southern Boys in WCW, and then later in ECW in the later 90s, he was
[49:59.580 --> 50:00.860]  in the Full-Blooded Italians.
[50:01.600 --> 50:02.020]  Fucking...
[50:02.020 --> 50:04.040]  They announced him from Nashville, Italy.
[50:04.400 --> 50:04.980]  It was perfect.
[50:05.960 --> 50:06.920]  It was awesome.
[50:07.080 --> 50:10.020]  I think you might have named...
[50:10.580 --> 50:12.220]  Every person you named might be in this pack.
[50:12.360 --> 50:13.200]  Here's Arn Anderson.
[50:13.340 --> 50:13.780]  Yeah, of course.
[50:14.140 --> 50:15.340]  The classic Arn.
[50:15.500 --> 50:16.220]  Still working.
[50:16.480 --> 50:17.420]  He's in AEW.
[50:17.600 --> 50:18.660]  That's a synergistic plug.
[50:18.860 --> 50:20.900]  I don't know who this is.
[50:20.940 --> 50:22.720]  I've never heard of Flyin' Brian.
[50:23.060 --> 50:24.340]  Oh, so that's Brian Pillman.
[50:24.440 --> 50:26.480]  They just did a Dark Side of the Ring about him.
[50:26.740 --> 50:28.140]  He died in 97.
[50:29.060 --> 50:32.000]  His son wrestles in AEW, Brian Pillman Jr.
[50:32.000 --> 50:37.420]  But he was in a tag team with Steve Austin, and he was crazy, and he was awesome.
[50:38.160 --> 50:40.400]  Is a pro wrestling career...
[50:40.400 --> 50:40.540]  Yeah.
[50:40.820 --> 50:43.900]  Is that like a guarantee at an early, unfortunate death?
[50:43.980 --> 50:45.980]  It used to be, and it's not so much anymore.
[50:46.180 --> 50:46.380]  Okay.
[50:46.420 --> 50:48.660]  Now everyone lives to be longer, and everybody does like...
[50:48.660 --> 50:49.500]  Everyone's like...
[50:49.500 --> 50:51.940]  They like study nutrition, and...
[50:51.940 --> 50:53.600]  Seems like a guarantee at a mullet, though.
[50:53.840 --> 50:54.800]  Yeah, in this...
[50:54.800 --> 50:55.000]  Yeah.
[50:55.340 --> 50:57.480]  He was also a Cincinnati Bengals, so I mean that's...
[50:57.480 --> 50:57.880]  Was he really?
[50:57.960 --> 50:58.140]  Yeah.
[50:58.260 --> 50:58.520]  Oh.
[50:58.520 --> 51:00.320]  How about Doom?
[51:00.440 --> 51:01.260]  There you go, there's Doom.
[51:01.480 --> 51:02.500]  There's a Hacksaw Butch Reed.
[51:02.740 --> 51:03.280]  There's Hacksaw.
[51:03.880 --> 51:05.080]  He's taking out Stinger.
[51:05.460 --> 51:06.600]  He's taking out the Stinger right there.
[51:07.280 --> 51:07.680]  Elegante.
[51:08.020 --> 51:08.400]  Oh, yeah.
[51:08.840 --> 51:12.320]  The giant Gonzales, he worked in WWF after that.
[51:12.460 --> 51:13.220]  Oh, Slamma!
[51:13.480 --> 51:13.880]  Oh!
[51:15.100 --> 51:15.500]  Finally.
[51:16.180 --> 51:17.700]  That is way less impressive.
[51:17.820 --> 51:20.120]  I was hoping for something shiny or something on it.
[51:20.240 --> 51:20.400]  Yeah.
[51:20.660 --> 51:21.600]  Oh, it's just a Merlin.
[51:21.600 --> 51:22.540]  Oh, it just says Merlin.
[51:22.640 --> 51:22.920]  Yeah.
[51:23.220 --> 51:23.840]  Oh, that sucks.
[51:24.000 --> 51:24.640]  That's a letdown.
[51:24.800 --> 51:24.920]  Yep.
[51:24.960 --> 51:26.160]  Another flying Brian.
[51:26.160 --> 51:26.660]  Hell yeah.
[51:26.800 --> 51:27.780]  He was a Cincinnati Bingle.
[51:27.880 --> 51:28.740]  Hey, there you go.
[51:29.140 --> 51:30.280]  Professional football player there for a while.
[51:30.480 --> 51:31.200]  Crazy dude.
[51:31.320 --> 51:31.460]  Yep.
[51:31.800 --> 51:32.720]  You ever see the dark side of the ring?
[51:33.120 --> 51:33.680]  On him?
[51:33.880 --> 51:34.480]  You're doing great.
[51:35.580 --> 51:36.220]  Steiner Brothers.
[51:36.280 --> 51:40.080]  I remember the Steiner Brothers because they wore wrestling gear like one of them did.
[51:40.160 --> 51:41.480]  Rick Steiner wore the wrestling gear.
[51:41.600 --> 51:45.640]  Scott Steiner, much later in his career, is notably an insane man.
[51:46.400 --> 51:46.940]  And he talked...
[51:46.940 --> 51:51.620]  Scott Steiner does a whole promo about math where he's got a 33 and a third chance of winning.
[51:51.620 --> 51:54.720]  And you add that to his 75 and two-thirds chance of winning.
[51:54.960 --> 51:58.180]  And he has a 41, 141 and two-thirds chance of winning.
[51:58.400 --> 52:03.120]  And the numbers spell disaster for Samoa Joe at Sacrifice.
[52:03.760 --> 52:04.040]  So...
[52:04.040 --> 52:04.300]  Who won?
[52:04.560 --> 52:05.960]  That match did not occur.
[52:08.080 --> 52:08.920]  Ricky Morton.
[52:08.980 --> 52:10.080]  Oh, Ricky Morton!
[52:10.220 --> 52:12.940]  Man, Ricky Morton's still working.
[52:13.220 --> 52:14.360]  He's like 50-something.
[52:14.500 --> 52:15.320]  He still wrestles.
[52:15.400 --> 52:15.860]  He does flip piledrivers.
[52:15.860 --> 52:16.840]  Didn't we just do a collab with them?
[52:17.060 --> 52:18.680]  Didn't we just do like some shirts or something?
[52:18.820 --> 52:19.880]  With AEW?
[52:20.040 --> 52:20.760]  No, that's...
[52:20.760 --> 52:21.680]  Oh.
[52:23.740 --> 52:25.920]  Hey guys, check out the Ricky Morton mug.
[52:26.200 --> 52:28.320]  You can get a Chopped Heart Rooster t-shirt or whatever.
[52:30.380 --> 52:31.340]  Ricky Morton.
[52:31.680 --> 52:32.560]  That rules.
[52:32.840 --> 52:37.680]  If Gavin had been born when I was born, like in 75 and he grew up in the 80s, this was Gavin's hair.
[52:38.200 --> 52:38.640]  That's Gavin.
[52:39.400 --> 52:41.800]  15-year-old Gavin in 1987.
[52:42.220 --> 52:43.260]  Ricky Morton rules.
[52:43.660 --> 52:44.380]  Tommy Rich.
[52:44.560 --> 52:45.360]  Similar hair.
[52:46.880 --> 52:48.380]  This guy looks like Burt Kreischer.
[52:48.800 --> 52:50.140]  This is Dutch Mantel.
[52:50.140 --> 52:51.580]  Oh, Dirty Dutch.
[52:52.460 --> 52:54.020]  Dirty Dutch Mantel.
[52:54.360 --> 52:55.380]  Really great.
[52:55.740 --> 52:56.160]  Great wrestler.
[52:56.260 --> 52:58.560]  Eric, what can you tell us about the Fabulous Freebird?
[52:58.780 --> 53:03.000]  The Fabulous Freebird, what you're seeing right there is Michael P.S. Hayes.
[53:03.760 --> 53:06.460]  The P.S. stands for Purely Sexy.
[53:07.720 --> 53:10.560]  He is still working in WWE.
[53:11.100 --> 53:15.040]  He is one of the guys who's like really high up and making matches and everything.
[53:16.160 --> 53:19.360]  You can see them if you ever want to look up some stuff where you go,
[53:19.360 --> 53:20.740]  fuck, that was in the 80s.
[53:21.040 --> 53:25.720]  You can see when they, the Freebirds, worked against the Von Erics in Texas
[53:25.720 --> 53:29.940]  and they came out and painted their faces like the Confederate flag.
[53:30.920 --> 53:32.120]  So that doesn't age well.
[53:32.280 --> 53:34.460]  Welcome to professional wrestling.
[53:35.120 --> 53:38.340]  You really have hit some expertise on both sides there.
[53:38.380 --> 53:39.980]  Yeah, that's what I was going for.
[53:40.160 --> 53:44.460]  I was trying to maximize the useless knowledge that you guys have accumulated.
[53:44.460 --> 53:45.680]  What's Andrew's? Hockey?
[53:46.580 --> 53:48.080]  No, not even hockey.
[53:48.080 --> 53:49.820]  Like a narrow window of hockey.
[53:49.960 --> 53:52.420]  I guess it was Battlefield Earth at all points.
[53:53.180 --> 53:54.020]  And bowling.
[53:54.520 --> 53:58.300]  I love, cutting over to this screen makes you think that it's Jack.
[53:59.700 --> 54:00.740]  Or the trellis.
[54:00.880 --> 54:02.620]  Yeah, it's the trellis.
[54:02.720 --> 54:04.020]  We got Lex Luger.
[54:04.200 --> 54:05.080]  I remember Lex Luger.
[54:05.580 --> 54:06.500]  Oh, here we go.
[54:07.780 --> 54:09.400]  20 pictures of the same guy.
[54:09.580 --> 54:10.940]  These are all different people.
[54:11.020 --> 54:11.660]  There's Sting.
[54:11.700 --> 54:13.040]  So Sting wrestles in AEW.
[54:13.280 --> 54:14.480]  He's 63 years old.
[54:14.480 --> 54:18.540]  Just had a pay-per-view match against Scorpio Sky and Ethan Page.
[54:18.680 --> 54:23.240]  You can see Scorpio Sky and James Willems every Thursday here on Rooster Teeth.
[54:23.420 --> 54:24.260]  Wrestling With The Week.
[54:24.400 --> 54:25.460]  Oh, that's the podcast you guys do?
[54:25.500 --> 54:25.820]  Absolutely.
[54:26.260 --> 54:27.160]  How is that? Is that fun, Sting?
[54:27.200 --> 54:27.680]  Yeah, it's great.
[54:27.780 --> 54:28.540]  Fun to listen to.
[54:28.840 --> 54:29.680]  Seems like it'd be fun to do.
[54:29.940 --> 54:31.880]  You know what? I love all my children equally.
[54:33.000 --> 54:34.680]  That's not how it works, but thank you for saying that.
[54:35.120 --> 54:36.480]  Terry Taylor, I don't remember him.
[54:36.560 --> 54:36.980]  He's a cutie.
[54:37.020 --> 54:37.440]  The Red Rooster.
[54:38.200 --> 54:38.820]  Red Rooster?
[54:38.820 --> 54:40.060]  They brought him in.
[54:40.180 --> 54:45.540]  He had a red top on his hair, and they called him the Red Rooster.
[54:45.720 --> 54:46.640]  It wasn't a very good gimmick.
[54:46.800 --> 54:48.140]  He had a red top on his hair?
[54:48.220 --> 54:52.940]  Like a mohawk that was red, and then it stuck up, and they called him the Red Rooster.
[54:53.140 --> 54:53.760]  It really sucked.
[54:54.340 --> 54:54.420]  Yeah.
[54:55.280 --> 54:56.220]  Poor Terry Taylor.
[54:56.260 --> 54:56.880]  This one's interesting.
[54:56.960 --> 55:00.320]  It's Fabulous Freebirds again, but this freebird is feeling some kind of way.
[55:00.420 --> 55:00.600]  Yeah.
[55:01.700 --> 55:04.820]  I think it's Tommy Rich with Michael P.S. Hayes.
[55:04.820 --> 55:09.100]  So this is interesting.
[55:09.280 --> 55:09.440]  Okay.
[55:09.540 --> 55:13.160]  This is Mr. Wallstreet, and I understand what I'm looking at here.
[55:13.260 --> 55:15.420]  I understand that there's a man's head somewhere over there.
[55:15.720 --> 55:23.640]  But what it looks like is Mr. Wallstreet is mounting someone from behind, and they're about to make sweet love.
[55:23.660 --> 55:27.760]  Just because of the tan line under the arm, it looks a little bit like someone's not wearing pants.
[55:27.760 --> 55:32.620]  You might recognize Mr. Wallstreet as I.R.S. from the WWF.
[55:33.140 --> 55:41.060]  Irwin R. Shyster, who wore the button-up and the tie and wore the glasses, and he called everyone tax cheats.
[55:41.380 --> 55:47.140]  So he was a high-powered Wallstreet stockbroker, and then he left and became an I.R.S. man.
[55:47.160 --> 55:48.440]  That's an interesting career trajectory.
[55:48.620 --> 55:49.320]  We got a Lex Luger.
[55:49.640 --> 55:50.480]  Another Steiner brother.
[55:51.460 --> 55:52.760]  He looks like the dumb one.
[55:53.400 --> 55:54.800]  Oh, that's Rick right there.
[55:55.380 --> 55:55.880]  And the dog.
[55:56.340 --> 55:56.840]  There's a dog.
[55:56.840 --> 55:57.280]  That's fun.
[55:57.320 --> 55:58.080]  He was the third brother.
[55:59.320 --> 56:00.040]  Another Sting.
[56:00.060 --> 56:01.080]  He's going like this.
[56:01.120 --> 56:02.140]  He's going...
[56:02.780 --> 56:03.740]  I'm the Stinger.
[56:04.140 --> 56:04.900]  His patented Sting move.
[56:07.580 --> 56:08.980]  Fucking terrified the other wrestlers.
[56:09.520 --> 56:11.540]  And then, of course, Ric Flair wearing a nightgown.
[56:12.700 --> 56:13.520]  And holding up...
[56:13.520 --> 56:16.700]  He's holding up the Four Horsemen.
[56:16.860 --> 56:18.020]  He's holding up the Fours.
[56:18.400 --> 56:19.500]  Looks like he's changing a lightbulb.
[56:19.520 --> 56:20.600]  It does look like he's changing a lightbulb.
[56:20.620 --> 56:21.980]  No, he's holding up the Fours.
[56:22.140 --> 56:25.560]  That's the power from the Four Horsemen emanating from him.
[56:25.560 --> 56:26.260]  These are great cards.
[56:26.420 --> 56:27.360]  These are great cards.
[56:27.360 --> 56:28.340]  Alright, I'm opening up a little bit.
[56:28.560 --> 56:29.740]  Oh, I should...
[56:29.740 --> 56:30.220]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[56:30.360 --> 56:30.960]  Sacrifice one of the pack sack.
[56:31.040 --> 56:31.400]  That's right.
[56:31.520 --> 56:33.180]  Pack sack gets bigger every day.
[56:33.620 --> 56:33.960]  I love it.
[56:34.180 --> 56:35.520]  We need to go through it and...
[56:35.520 --> 56:36.040]  Yeah, eventually.
[56:36.500 --> 56:37.560]  ...de-sack it a little bit.
[56:37.620 --> 56:39.620]  I mean, once we get Gus' collection, it's really going to be something.
[56:39.840 --> 56:41.780]  Dude, Gus' collection is going to be a whole other deal.
[56:42.800 --> 56:44.120]  Another fabulous Freebirds card.
[56:44.120 --> 56:44.900]  So, here's what I'm guessing.
[56:45.040 --> 56:50.480]  In 1991-12, there were eight wrestlers.
[56:50.640 --> 56:55.180]  Well, in WCW at this time, that's kind of how it worked.
[56:55.180 --> 56:56.600]  Not a lot of guys...
[56:56.600 --> 56:57.300]  Lex Luger again.
[56:57.440 --> 56:58.680]  This sort of became...
[56:58.680 --> 57:01.040]  This was when it was like the dregs of WCW.
[57:01.540 --> 57:02.480]  This is a pretty good one.
[57:02.520 --> 57:02.800]  Okay.
[57:03.260 --> 57:03.620]  What do we got?
[57:03.800 --> 57:04.500]  This is...
[57:05.020 --> 57:06.460]  It's obviously more Steiner Brothers.
[57:06.820 --> 57:12.420]  But for some reason, the way it lines up, it looks like his boot is making an arrow into his butthole.
[57:12.540 --> 57:13.440]  It does!
[57:13.780 --> 57:14.580]  Look up here.
[57:15.000 --> 57:15.660]  Yeah, it's like...
[57:15.660 --> 57:17.500]  Right, that's where the magic happened.
[57:17.520 --> 57:17.900]  That's it.
[57:18.160 --> 57:18.660]  Check it out.
[57:18.760 --> 57:19.780]  So, that's a hit.
[57:19.860 --> 57:20.440]  Pretty cool, Rick.
[57:20.540 --> 57:21.520]  Yeah, another Sting.
[57:22.200 --> 57:24.440]  Another Ric Flair and his...
[57:24.440 --> 57:25.340]  He's holding up the force.
[57:25.500 --> 57:25.780]  Poor horseman.
[57:25.920 --> 57:27.180]  Didn't have his lightbulb with him this time.
[57:27.340 --> 57:27.600]  Awesome.
[57:28.920 --> 57:31.560]  Here's some more problematic Southern boys.
[57:31.840 --> 57:32.760]  Yeah, Tracy Smothers.
[57:34.240 --> 57:36.800]  Sid Vicious is about to go to town on that guy's butthole.
[57:37.180 --> 57:38.620]  He's about to feast.
[57:38.760 --> 57:39.880]  He's about to powerbomb.
[57:40.040 --> 57:41.740]  Sid Vicious is the king of the world.
[57:42.460 --> 57:42.940]  Fuck yeah.
[57:43.240 --> 57:46.640]  This is Ric Flair stomping on Sting's junk.
[57:46.760 --> 57:47.820]  They had a great feud.
[57:47.820 --> 57:48.400]  That's a pretty good one.
[57:48.700 --> 57:50.680]  He's about to put him in the figure four leg lock.
[57:51.780 --> 57:52.960]  Another Southern boys.
[57:55.260 --> 58:00.440]  Listen, WCW was in Atlanta and it was the Southern wrassling.
[58:00.520 --> 58:03.800]  And there's Missy Hyatt again, who was apparently the only female.
[58:04.000 --> 58:06.080]  Yes, at this time, yeah, pretty much.
[58:06.640 --> 58:09.340]  I don't think there was anything else super...
[58:09.340 --> 58:09.780]  Yeah, okay.
[58:10.880 --> 58:12.000]  Why don't we open up another one?
[58:12.060 --> 58:12.300]  Fuck it.
[58:12.480 --> 58:13.400]  Yeah, let's do it.
[58:14.580 --> 58:15.620]  What are we going to get this time?
[58:15.660 --> 58:20.000]  I also have one I want to open up over here that I'm kind of excited about.
[58:20.460 --> 58:21.540]  So, we'll do that next.
[58:21.540 --> 58:24.040]  Alright, last pack of WCW for now.
[58:24.300 --> 58:24.480]  Okay.
[58:24.880 --> 58:26.040]  And then...
[58:26.040 --> 58:27.620]  Oh, what a surprise.
[58:28.000 --> 58:28.860]  Got a Southern boy.
[58:29.000 --> 58:29.380]  Hell yeah.
[58:29.600 --> 58:30.480]  Got a Sid Vicious.
[58:30.580 --> 58:31.620]  Got a Ric Flair.
[58:32.120 --> 58:33.020]  Southern boy.
[58:33.940 --> 58:36.180]  Missy Hyatt with the old what's-his-face.
[58:36.200 --> 58:36.940]  Jim Ross.
[58:36.940 --> 58:37.600]  Still working.
[58:37.840 --> 58:39.540]  He's in AEW.
[58:40.180 --> 58:40.880]  He's one of the announcers.
[58:41.180 --> 58:43.360]  Didn't rate a name on the card for some reason.
[58:43.400 --> 58:43.680]  Ouch.
[58:43.780 --> 58:44.400]  Arne Anderson.
[58:45.200 --> 58:46.160]  Flying Brian.
[58:46.420 --> 58:46.760]  Hell yeah.
[58:47.020 --> 58:48.880]  Only our second Doom card.
[58:48.960 --> 58:49.280]  Hell yeah.
[58:49.380 --> 58:50.160]  Second Elegante.
[58:50.900 --> 58:51.820]  Terry Taylor.
[58:52.060 --> 58:54.520]  The 12,000th Steiner Brothers card.
[58:55.220 --> 58:56.340]  Wow, that's a cool dog.
[58:57.960 --> 58:59.360]  I just feel bad about this card.
[59:00.540 --> 59:03.340]  Do you think Ricky Morton knows that that picture of him exists?
[59:04.500 --> 59:06.880]  Oh, I bet Ricky Morton sells that picture.
[59:07.180 --> 59:08.080]  These cards?
[59:09.020 --> 59:11.000]  I bet Ricky Morton has bought all of his cards.
[59:11.280 --> 59:11.460]  Unfortunate.
[59:11.720 --> 59:14.520]  And then sells them at wrestling shows that he goes to now.
[59:14.700 --> 59:16.360]  Do you know what Ricky Morton looks like in that photo?
[59:16.660 --> 59:20.140]  He looks like a guy in Clearwater, Florida.
[59:20.140 --> 59:20.740]  Yeah.
[59:21.700 --> 59:22.800]  You're nailing it so far.
[59:22.880 --> 59:24.840]  He probably works on a boat.
[59:25.700 --> 59:26.580]  He cleans a boat.
[59:26.740 --> 59:26.860]  Right.
[59:26.940 --> 59:28.180]  Like a fishing charter or something.
[59:28.740 --> 59:31.520]  And then at night, he works at a pirate-themed restaurant.
[59:32.180 --> 59:33.180]  This is him off work.
[59:33.560 --> 59:35.660]  That's why he's got his poofy pirate shirt on.
[59:35.740 --> 59:37.400]  And he's going to get fucked up.
[59:37.480 --> 59:39.440]  Because he made $86 in tips.
[59:39.520 --> 59:40.940]  And he's gonna go buy some Bud Light.
[59:41.380 --> 59:46.400]  And he's gonna, I don't know, sit on the beach and try to figure out why the fuck he makes those faces.
[59:47.080 --> 59:51.560]  I mean, you pretty much nailed all... I mean, that's right.
[59:51.980 --> 59:52.900]  It's Ricky Morton.
[59:53.380 --> 59:54.440]  He's still kicking.
[59:54.920 --> 59:55.680]  He's still working.
[59:56.420 --> 59:57.300]  Ricky Morton rules.
[59:57.580 --> 59:59.080]  I'm very excited about this next pack.
[59:59.180 --> 59:59.480]  Oh, yeah?
[59:59.660 --> 01:00:01.020]  I wanted to get a whole box of these.
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:01.240]  Okay.
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:05.860]  But I could only find, honest to God, one pack on eBay.
[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:09.400]  So I bought... Jaws 2, considered one of the worst movies ever made.
[01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:12.420]  I saw some photos... I was just doing some browsing.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.880]  And I saw some Jaws 2 cards.
[01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:14.780]  And they were pretty cool.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:15.200]  Okay.
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.780]  And so I put some effort into getting... This was the only pack I was able to find.
[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:23.580]  There's one pack of this right now on eBay for $3.99.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:24.380]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:25.460]  Plus $3.50 shipping.
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:26.140]  That's ridiculous.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:26.900]  For these.
[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:28.420]  For what you're about to see.
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.540]  Jaws 2, Monster Attacks.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:31.080]  Oh, come on.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:31.640]  That's a pretty cool card.
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.380]  I've never seen Jaws 2.
[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:34.120]  Then we got Brody at the Beach.
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:38.060]  We've got Smashed Like a Matchstick.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.640]  Ooh, we've got Roy Schreiber and Hal Holbrook going at it in Chewing Out Mayor Vaughn.
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:44.300]  Oh, perfect.
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:45.820]  We've got Chief Martin Brody.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:46.360]  Uh-huh.
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.200]  We've got The Calm Before the Storm.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.440]  And, unfortunately, Close Brush With Death.
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:55.680]  What I really was hoping to get was the Shot of Jaws.
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:57.040]  Because it's terrible.
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.460]  It's so hilariously bad.
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:01.300]  I was hoping to get a Shot of Jaws card.
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:03.760]  No, I did get this sweet Roy Schreiber.
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:04.360]  I like that one.
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:06.660]  But the shark isn't called Jaws.
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:07.680]  Oh, it's a sticker.
[01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:09.080]  What's the shark called?
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:10.960]  It's just a shark, isn't it?
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:12.900]  Oh, I guess they didn't name it, did they?
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:14.320]  The movie's about jaws.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.680]  Yeah, it doesn't seem like it would be something they could name.
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:19.900]  Wow, we have three Slammers and they all suck.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:21.300]  Let's go Bruce.
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:25.800]  Okay, we still have a lot of time left.
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:28.120]  Well, yeah, that's because last time you wanted it to go longer and longer.
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.660]  I wanted it to go longer and longer, I remember.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.980]  What should we open?
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.500]  I think we're low on lawyers today.
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:34.100]  You said we're low on what?
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:34.720]  Low on lawyers?
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:35.620]  We're low on lawyers.
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:37.840]  Oh, Slamma, back-to-back Slammas.
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:39.060]  Oh, that's a green one.
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:39.460]  You got a green one.
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:40.540]  That's a rare.
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:41.720]  I don't know if that's...
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:46.100]  While we're in between things, I'm making a small collection of very poor quality Pogs.
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:49.640]  This one has some of the wrapper of the next card over.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.620]  These ones are printed completely wonky.
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:54.240]  Oh, really?
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:58.120]  And this one, it's so washed out, you can't really tell what it is.
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:01:59.780]  These rule.
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:00.760]  These are amazing.
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:01.220]  What is that?
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:02.120]  Pogs are back.
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:04.720]  Yeah, Pogs are... I can't believe they ever left.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.120]  Yvonne, how could you do this?
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.800]  I have a lot of stuff here that we could open, but a lot of it's for...
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:13.520]  I'm more of a promotional to kind of tease future stuff.
[01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:14.920]  I like the idea of...
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:15.200]  Slamma!
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.880]  I love the idea...
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.340]  That's three in a row.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.960]  ...of highlighting your strengths, right?
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:23.960]  Like you and wrestling, you and James Bond, Andrew and Fred Flintstone.
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:24.260]  Yeah.
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:28.320]  So I got, like, Revenge. You remember the TV show, Revenge?
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:30.660]  No, I don't. I wanted to ask you about that.
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:31.400]  Yeah, I don't know what this is.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.100]  I don't know anyone who's seen it. I don't know why these exist.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.120]  Who was in Revenge?
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:36.740]  Who was in Revenge?
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:38.920]  Are you asking Andrew, the guy who said he hasn't seen it?
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:41.100]  No, I'm just throwing it out there to the group.
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:45.220]  Revenge is a huge show. Michael and I were very big fans of Revenge.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.660]  So I accidentally bought two boxes of this.
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:53.060]  So I'm hoping one day to bring Michael on and open it up with me.
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:54.820]  Why does Revenge have an eight in it?
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:55.780]  Yeah.
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:56.680]  Are there eight people?
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:00.100]  She's gonna get infinite revenge. It's an infinity sign.
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:01.340]  She's getting infinite revenge.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:01.940]  Look on the side.
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:04.760]  This is Emily Vanderkamp. If you don't know this, Emily Vanderkamp,
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:07.980]  Her dad went to jail and it was unfair.
[01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:13.140]  And she gets revenge on every one of these motherfuckers for putting her dad in jail.
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.360]  I thought you were talking about the actress.
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.700]  Well, her name in the show is Emily Vanderkamp.
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:21.460]  And she gets revenge on... well, she knows how to fight. I'll say that.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.780]  She fucks these people up for like three seasons.
[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:25.080]  She knows how to fight?
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:26.080]  Does she kill anyone?
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:27.420]  Well, she knows how to fight.
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:28.900]  I'm just saying. I'm just saying.
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:32.120]  Did you go to dinner?
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:33.500]  Didn't walk the dog.
[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:36.940]  Then got some... these are pretty exciting.
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:39.100]  One Direction cards.
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:39.760]  Are those for Millie?
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:46.260]  But I figured that would go great with the box of Stranger Things cards that I got for Millie.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:47.860]  That's very cool.
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.260]  Another David Harbour.
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:50.280]  Yeah, we get another David Harbour.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.060]  So you got Stranger Things?
[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:52.500]  Yeah.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.320]  Are there any more Stranger Things cards?
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.720]  I accidentally bought two boxes of them.
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:00.360]  So yes, there are. I accidentally bought two of a lot of stuff.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.280]  So yeah, I got a bunch of stuff to open up that I don't necessarily want to open up.
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.700]  That's cool. That's great for this show where we open stuff up.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.040]  I appreciate it. I agree with you.
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:10.640]  But what I do think we should open up, but I think this is going to be weird.
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:12.700]  You see that box of Rad Dudes?
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:13.480]  Oh, right here?
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:16.020]  Yeah, I discovered these recently.
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:22.020]  These were an attempt at capitalizing on the success and popularity.
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:25.360]  The slammer that I was after with the shiny on.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.000]  Wow, really?
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.400]  You don't throw a gold slammer.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:30.460]  Look at that.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:30.780]  Wow!
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:33.800]  Look at that. Give it a wiggle. Look at the sheen on that.
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:34.700]  That's gorgeous.
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:35.400]  Yes!
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:35.940]  Wow.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:37.780]  Is this real gold?
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.620]  Well, stack up all these pogs. How many pogs do you want to stack?
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:41.460]  And we can slam them.
[01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:43.500]  There you go.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.040]  You should slam more.
[01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:46.420]  Wow. Alright.
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:48.220]  So then I just do this?
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:50.620]  Yeah, there's different techniques, but I think you got it.
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:51.340]  Can you do it on the edge?
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:53.880]  I don't know. I've never slammed.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:54.900]  Well, I mean, that's up to you.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:58.820]  The edge is a good strategy if you're looking to flip, but not hit a lot.
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:04:59.400]  You know what I mean?
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.920]  So I just hit it, and then if anything falls over, I keep it?
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.720]  Well, it's not falls over. It's like the ones, you know, they're all facing up.
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:05.540]  So the ones that face down...
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.600]  Well, so I'll make them all the right way.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.380]  So that way we can see which ones you keep.
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.320]  Welcome to Fuck Face Break Shit.
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:15.440]  I think we're selling this shirt someday, and probably this hat someday, too, if you guys want to buy that.
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:16.040]  I don't know.
[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:17.060]  This shirt's on sale now.
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:20.720]  Yeah, I don't think either of the things I'm wearing are, but...
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.440]  Oh, and this hat.
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:25.040]  We got a Waffle Bomb air freshener.
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:27.000]  Oh, I put that in my car, and...
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.360]  Oh, can I smell that? I've heard it's awful.
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:29.540]  Oh, you're gonna open it? Alright, cool.
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:29.980]  I've never opened it.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.200]  I've heard it's an absolute disgrace.
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:34.440]  The reviews are in, and they love it!
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:38.360]  It's...
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.400]  Oh, shit!
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:43.000]  I've not actually smelled it either. I was too scared to open it.
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:45.520]  It is... Oh, really? Mine's in my car.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.620]  It smells like the bottom of my gran's handbag.
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:49.800]  Does your grandmother carry a lot of masonry?
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:52.400]  Horrible.
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.720]  This guy... Okay, here's a One Rooster review.
[01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:58.900]  The design is dope, but the smell is far from pleasant.
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:05:59.800]  Seems about right.
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:02.760]  Another one. Worst purchase I've ever made.
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.440]  This is the most foul thing I've ever smelled.
[01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:07.360]  It smells like chemicals wrapped in feces.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.240]  You know what it smells like?
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.800]  It smells like a Doubletree hotel room.
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:11.580]  It does. Yep.
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:12.940]  I don't have to smell it.
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:13.500]  It really does.
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:13.960]  In my car.
[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:16.860]  You have it in your car. Your car smells like that?
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:17.460]  Well, not anymore.
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:19.580]  I'm gonna put it over Lamello Ball.
[01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:22.720]  One more One Rooster review on the site.
[01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:24.020]  Looks great, smells awful.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.200]  It's a funny air freshener.
[01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:27.820]  It didn't smell like waffles or maple, which was disappointing.
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:29.300]  It smells nothing like a waffle.
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:31.120]  Oh my god.
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:31.540]  It's pretty bad.
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.280]  Let's slam this Pog.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:34.960]  Alright, here we go.
[01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:37.360]  I hope I do this right.
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.460]  See, when I was Pogging...
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:42.180]  I knew you were a Pogger.
[01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:43.720]  God, that smell is just permeating.
[01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:44.440]  Oh, like that.
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.060]  Yeah, see, that's different techniques, man.
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:47.740]  Pfft.
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:54.140]  Different techniques.
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.180]  Alright, Eric, you're up.
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.200]  He didn't even...
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:58.960]  He didn't do anything.
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.180]  Maybe they need to be the other way up? I don't know.
[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:02.880]  Oh, I had that corner.
[01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:04.660]  But see, then it would be your turn.
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:05.960]  There you go.
[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:06.380]  Oh!
[01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:07.760]  You got two pairs of Brosnans.
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:09.460]  Yeah, you got some Brosnans.
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:09.960]  That's stupid.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:13.140]  Anyway, that's why it was cool for about nine months.
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:14.780]  So...
[01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:15.780]  God, that smell.
[01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:23.420]  Apparently, in the early 90s, Pacific tried to capitalize on the success of Garbage Pail Kids.
[01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:25.740]  And they created Rad Dudes.
[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:28.520]  This is Boombox Brian.
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:31.060]  And they call him that because he's a dude with a boombox, I guess.
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:31.400]  That's cool.
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:33.960]  So, we're gonna open some of these up.
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:36.820]  Just move it over here.
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:38.080]  I can't believe we sell that.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.180]  Don't throw it away.
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.520]  No, I would never.
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:41.780]  I think...
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:44.540]  Here's an idea.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:48.140]  Have you ever seen a movie called Grumpy Old Men?
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:48.940]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:49.420]  Alright.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.220]  One of the best movies ever made, first of all.
[01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:57.040]  One of the best parts of that movie is when Burgess Meredith, I think...
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:03.260]  I don't remember who it was, but he hides the fish in the backseat of the car.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.900]  And then, I believe it's Walter Matthau, has to keep adding air fresheners, air freshener trees to the car because he can't figure it out.
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.760]  What you can do...
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:12.920]  Here's what I'm recommending, audience.
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:17.420]  If you're a comment leaver and you're watching this right now and you want to get revenge on somebody,
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:21.500]  why don't you buy a couple of those, hide them under the seat of the car.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.960]  Honestly, what a great fucking idea.
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:29.820]  Could you imagine, Gavin, imagine getting into a car and it just smelled like that,
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.340]  and then you go, what happened to your car?
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:34.980]  And they go, I have no idea.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:35.580]  Yeah.
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:41.580]  I bet you pop three of those bad boys under the passenger seat, you're gonna ruin somebody's month.
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:45.960]  Here's the thing, you buy like 12 of them, and then you just wait.
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:52.640]  Because you throw two in to start, and then when they think it's gone, you just keep sliding a new one in every week or so.
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:57.540]  Can you tell what this is? It looks like a Bluetooth headset or a belt.
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.140]  I can't really tell what that is.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:02.660]  You said Bluetooth headset, and I went, yeah, that's what it is.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.800]  And then you said belt, and I went, that's what it is.
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:07.840]  I don't think Bluetooth existed in 1995.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:08.540]  What the fuck is that?
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:10.400]  We just shot of it.
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:13.860]  Remember that James Bond thing?
[01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:15.220]  Andrew, what do you think that is?
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:19.240]  Is it like an earpiece and a mic?
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:24.020]  The thing is, he did have a belt in that movie that he swung across out the window and landed on a tank.
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:25.700]  That must be it.
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:26.280]  Could be that.
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.400]  It looks like some sort of a...
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:31.580]  Or then he got in a tank, he landed on like a...
[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:34.360]  It looks like some sort of one of those tools that they use to give you a colonic.
[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:38.400]  I don't think I've had one of those, so...
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:40.680]  Kneeboard Nick.
[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:42.180]  What the fuck?
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:45.340]  That's gotta be one of the worst drawn arms I have ever seen.
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:46.760]  Is that Nick? Is that Odd Nick?
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.160]  Is he doing this?
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:49.520]  He's like Hellier, bro?
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:50.520]  Yeah, he's like Kneeboard Nick.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:51.000]  That's sick.
[01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:54.620]  Cramming Clint, he's...
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:55.720]  I thought that was Cramming Clint.
[01:09:56.260 --> 01:10:00.200]  Cramming Clint, he's apparently studying up all night.
[01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:01.760]  What about that is Rad?
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:03.680]  Yeah, that I don't know.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.780]  This is Dodgeball Doug.
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:10.760]  Well, I think that there's a reason why these weren't as popular as...
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:11.680]  These are ugly as sin.
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:12.860]  What?
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:14.060]  They were also...
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.220]  What's happening to his head?
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:16.760]  Well, he's getting hit with apples.
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.100]  Yeah, but why is it with sin going?
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:19.220]  No, those would be dodgeballs.
[01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:20.060]  Dodgeballs.
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:22.020]  His name is Dodgeball Doug.
[01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:24.520]  I understand, but why does it have an apple stem on it?
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:25.640]  What?
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:26.260]  It doesn't.
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:27.320]  What's the blue thing?
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:28.980]  What's the blue thing?
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:32.160]  It's just like part of the pattern. It looks nothing like an apple stem.
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.480]  That's not a pattern, dude.
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:34.680]  What's the pattern there?
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:36.620]  It's not an apple stem. What do you mean it's an apple stem?
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:39.360]  Well, apples have a blue stem ironed on.
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:40.180]  I know, but it's a...
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:44.640]  Okay, well, here we go. Here's Checkin' Out the Babes Brett.
[01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:46.020]  So, there he is.
[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:46.540]  Oh, man.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:48.440]  That's Rad.
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:51.280]  Poser Pete, because he fell off his skateboard.
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:52.640]  I don't think you know what Rad means.
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.000]  Pete... Oh, this is... This did not age well.
[01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:57.520]  Well, this is definitely the 80s.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:00.680]  This is Pete and Tom and Jimmy. They were looking in the girls' locker room.
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:03.180]  You do this in the year 2021, you're gonna go to jail, dickhead.
[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:05.400]  Uh, Cram and Clint again. We got doubles.
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:07.820]  Dodgeball Doug again.
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:09.020]  Are those apple stems?
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:11.460]  They're all the same fucking cards again.
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:12.280]  What do you mean?
[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:13.780]  Are there only six red, dude?
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:14.320]  Wait, hang on.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.700]  I got two of everything in that one pack.
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:22.060]  Oh, I thought... I thought you just went through them all, but you kept putting them on the bottom, and then you went through them again.
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:23.400]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:24.660]  I'm a first Hagrid, by the way.
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:25.940]  Oh, there you go, Hagrid.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:31.600]  There's, uh...
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:32.880]  Just wipe out Wayne.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:33.780]  That rules.
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.480]  Wayne wiped out into the grass.
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:36.120]  Wayne.
[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:36.980]  Wayne.
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:39.520]  There's, uh, Jason Jock.
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:40.620]  He's like, who, me?
[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:41.160]  Hmm.
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:42.620]  Uh...
[01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:43.740]  He's not rad.
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:44.520]  These guys aren't rad.
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:45.800]  Surfing Stacy.
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:46.920]  She's rad.
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:47.400]  That's rad.
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:48.700]  Wait, what's that behind her?
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:49.060]  A lemon?
[01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:50.080]  Yeah, that's the sun.
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:50.360]  No, no, no.
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:52.100]  That's the barrel.
[01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:55.440]  That's, you can see, that's the sky behind her, like, in the yellow.
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.780]  Yeah, you can see she's in the barrel, bro.
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.800]  That's an orange with a stem.
[01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:00.220]  Jesus Christ.
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:02.340]  Uh, that is gnarly Brian and Trent.
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:02.740]  Yo.
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:03.200]  Man.
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:04.280]  What the fuck?
[01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:04.980]  Here's the deal.
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:06.220]  What the fuck?
[01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:08.020]  What is that guy's head?
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:10.040]  Dude, you might have to keep this one.
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:11.300]  That's ugly as shit.
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:13.260]  Why is his ass out?
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:14.900]  80s pranks.
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:15.560]  Bro.
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.080]  Is that our second Brian?
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:18.600]  Do we have two Brians?
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.080]  Is there a different Brian?
[01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:20.780]  There might be.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:23.480]  Was it like a crying Brian, or...
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:24.140]  Yeah, it was.
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:25.560]  I could have swore there was another Brian.
[01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:28.680]  There was a flying Brian, and he was a pro wrestler.
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.400]  There's Wipeout Wayne again.
[01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:32.980]  Oh, right, because you get two of every card in these fucking packs.
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:37.000]  This one's the weirdest one for me, I think.
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:42.640]  It's Wild Waylon and Willie, which I guess is a reference to Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson,
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:46.180]  but they seem to be taking a photo of somebody who's either masturbating or dumping.
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:49.040]  Not to be confused with the peeking Tom from the other one.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:50.360]  Different peekers.
[01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:51.180]  Yeah.
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.800]  Where do we measure leg height when they're sitting?
[01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:54.900]  That's true.
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.100]  It's just a leg-up card.
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:57.740]  It's a tough one.
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:59.560]  I'm gonna fucking open one more of these, and then we're gonna...
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:00.840]  By the way, these were, uh...
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:02.760]  A lot of the stuff I buy is expensive. These were not.
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:03.440]  Oh, yeah?
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:04.460]  This was about 15 bucks.
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.380]  These are my favorites so far, the rad dudes, though.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.140]  Halfpipe Pat.
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:07.400]  Yeah.
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:08.740]  Spit all over the fucking thing.
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:10.620]  Can you imagine that was the name first?
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:11.800]  Halfpipe Pat.
[01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:13.940]  Radical Ron.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.080]  That looks pretty...
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:15.460]  That's rad.
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:16.800]  He seems like he hurt his knee.
[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:20.140]  Dissecting Dan and Don.
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:21.860]  Jesus, this is half-assed.
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:24.320]  They're rad because they're in science?
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:25.420]  Because they like science.
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:27.220]  The other guy was rad because he was radical.
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:30.200]  Hang 10 Tony is not hanging 10 at all.
[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:31.880]  He's just surfing.
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:34.220]  Hanging 10 is putting 10 toes over the front of the front.
[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:34.900]  Well, that was him on his day off.
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:36.140]  And that would be on a long board.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.440]  This is definitely a short board.
[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:39.360]  We got Backup Bart.
[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:40.940]  Backup?
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:42.880]  Well, he's like...
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:43.280]  What is he?
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:46.620]  I guess he's got a remote-control plane, and he's like,
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:47.140]  Back up!
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:49.320]  Oh, so not like backing up your files.
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:50.160]  That's fucking stupid.
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:50.840]  In the 80s?
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:53.200]  No, it's probably not like backing up your files in the 80s.
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:54.500]  Rail Riding Ronnie again.
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:59.260]  They're like photos of how they got their nicknames.
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.000]  Can you give me all the ones that you already did of rad dudes?
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:03.380]  Yeah, the origin story.
[01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:04.180]  I just opened those.
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.240]  All the rad dudes.
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:06.840]  So I had a feeling...
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:08.820]  Hand Plant Hank.
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:10.080]  So I had a feeling...
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.200]  Messy Marty doesn't count.
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:13.720]  I knew there was a reason that we would get doubles and stuff like that.
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:14.520]  Spike and Spencer.
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:16.900]  Funky Fred.
[01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:19.740]  Oh, I see.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:21.960]  Yeah, I gotcha.
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:22.500]  That makes sense.
[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:23.780]  So here's...
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.760]  I don't think it's worth our fucking time.
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:29.980]  But there are some quotes on the back.
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:30.420]  Yeah.
[01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:31.380]  If you want to read that.
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.820]  And then some of the backs are duplicates, and then they make...
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:34.840]  Oh, is it conversation?
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:36.700]  Rad dudes.
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:39.120]  So here's Dodgeball Doug, if you can...
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:40.000]  If you want to read Dodgeball Doug?
[01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:40.400]  I will.
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:41.160]  Okay, cool.
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:44.180]  Oh, actually, if it's Dodgeball Doug, I have another one, I think.
[01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:45.160]  All right, Dodgeball players.
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:46.800]  Doug, you're out!
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:48.300]  Doug, you're out!
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:48.880]  Doug.
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:49.840]  Hey, dudes.
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:52.060]  Like, the little ball never hit me.
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:52.900]  Dodgeball players.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.280]  Yes, it did, Doug.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.320]  We saw it.
[01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:56.360]  You're out.
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:57.020]  Doug.
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:58.720]  Well, like, wow, dudes.
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:14:59.880]  Don't have a cow.
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:00.780]  Boom.
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:01.840]  So...
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:01.940]  Dodgeball Doug.
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.880]  Here's the thing, you're talking about...
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:10.600]  Andrew was talking about duplicate names.
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:13.880]  What the fuck?
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:15.680]  Radical Ron and Rail Riding Ronnie.
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:16.420]  Yeah.
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:17.680]  What the fuck?
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:21.200]  I hate these.
[01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:21.780]  All right, let's see.
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:22.760]  What do we learn about...
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:23.880]  Here, let's do...
[01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:25.480]  I'll let you...
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:26.860]  You do this play, and I'll do this one.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.340]  Okay, I'm gonna do the Radical Ron one.
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.240]  This is me as Ron.
[01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:33.460]  I'll be playing the part of Ron, Stacey, Ben, and then Ron again.
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:33.840]  Okay.
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:35.940]  Hey, dude, look at me.
[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:36.960]  I'm awesome.
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:38.100]  I assume I'm Radical Ron.
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:38.600]  I'm saying that.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.100]  And then Stacey, she goes, he's such a show-off.
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:42.220]  Stacey's not having it.
[01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:44.160]  Ben says, but he's an awesome skater.
[01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:47.240]  And then Ron says, wow, did you see me do that flip?
[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:48.100]  It was radical.
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:49.420]  Grrrr.
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:51.160]  Oh, yeah?
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:54.760]  Well, Ronny says, skating's not for poses, dude.
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:58.240]  Then Pete says, dude, I can't stay on my board.
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:01.300]  Ronny says, dude, you'll ruin my rep.
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:02.820]  I can't hang with poses.
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:04.680]  You're a geek, dude.
[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:05.820]  No!
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:07.140]  No!
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:08.920]  What?
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:12.020]  I can't believe that that card's gone forever now.
[01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:12.240]  Wow.
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:13.420]  We have two of them.
[01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:14.140]  We have two.
[01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:15.600]  One less of that.
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.080]  It's a PSA 10.
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.960]  Get these out of here.
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:22.500]  These are garbage.
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.160]  Well, when I was reading about them...
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:28.680]  When I was reading about them, the reviews were not good.
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:29.740]  Did you put one in the...
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:30.840]  Yeah, I did put a couple in there.
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:31.380]  Boy.
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:32.420]  Yeah, don't worry.
[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:33.520]  Oh, yeah.
[01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:35.100]  Feeling great now.
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:40.380]  God, I can still smell the fucking...
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:42.340]  Oh, yeah, because I put it over there instead of over here next to me.
[01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:43.140]  Teasing Toby.
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:45.020]  We had the one where he's teasing a baby.
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:47.160]  Oh, man.
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:48.480]  Pretty radical.
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:50.560]  Let's see what he says to the baby.
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:51.100]  Wait, hold on.
[01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:51.720]  Did you get the shot of that?
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:53.100]  Yeah, go ahead and give us the shot of it.
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:53.780]  Teasing Toby.
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:55.620]  That's a rad fucking dude.
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:55.960]  Yeah.
[01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:56.580]  Look at that guy.
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:57.460]  He's, like, torturing children.
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.080]  You know how we had, like...
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:16:59.420]  Are you hungry?
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:01.020]  We had, like...
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:03.360]  It was like the alliteration in the names.
[01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:05.540]  Someone who's pigging out.
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:05.880]  Yeah.
[01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:06.900]  What do you think their name would be?
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:07.960]  Scarf and Steve.
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:09.740]  No, it's pigging out.
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:10.180]  You know, Pete.
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.020]  Oh, pigging out Pete.
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:11.260]  Yeah.
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:11.860]  Right?
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:12.340]  You know, Pete.
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:15.300]  How about pigging out Owen?
[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:16.160]  What?
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:19.760]  Oh, they went with the O.
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:21.420]  They went with the O.
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:23.360]  Why would they do that?
[01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:25.580]  There's another toilet one.
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:26.960]  There's a lot of toilet.
[01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:28.600]  What?
[01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:30.300]  Oh, they're doing cherry bombs.
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:32.160]  Cool.
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:34.880]  Bicep brothers, but one of them doesn't seem to be on that team.
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:38.900]  That's me hanging out with Blaine.
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:39.420]  Blaine.
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:41.680]  Dude, you're toast.
[01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:42.340]  John.
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:43.540]  Au contraire, Wayne.
[01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:45.460]  Get ready to bite the big one, dude.
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:46.040]  Wayne.
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:46.240]  What?
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:47.240]  Go, dude.
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:48.380]  Grrr.
[01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:50.880]  Jesus fucking Christ.
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:51.500]  Why'd you buy these?
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:53.480]  Because I don't listen.
[01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:53.800]  They're rad.
[01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:54.940]  I didn't listen to the reviews.
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:55.760]  They're rad.
[01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:57.260]  God damn, those are brutal.
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:17:59.000]  Pretty cool.
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:00.240]  Pretty cool.
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:00.900]  Pretty cool.
[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:02.280]  Well, we got like another half hour.
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:03.200]  What do you want to crack into?
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:04.900]  Well, I kind of was hoping...
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:07.580]  Andrew, we haven't done anything for you yet other than Flintstones.
[01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:08.820]  Do you want to do some of your hockey?
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.900]  Yeah, do you see anything you like?
[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:10.940]  We could do hockey.
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.400]  I'd also be over the Shack Attack.
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.040]  I'd like to see how Shack Attack works.
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:14.600]  Let's do Shack Attack.
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:16.500]  You want to get into it?
[01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:17.200]  Get into Shack Attack.
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.000]  Let's see what the Shack Attack's all about.
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:19.500]  Again...
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:20.180]  My year of redemption.
[01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:24.020]  Yeah, Andrew said that Geoff had to buy this.
[01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:25.680]  Yeah, it was heavily implied.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:26.680]  Nope.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:27.460]  It wasn't.
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:29.180]  I asked how you felt about it.
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.340]  You said, they're fucking cool.
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:31.600]  I'm going to buy them.
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:32.520]  Uh-huh.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:33.380]  Damn your ass.
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:34.160]  And you didn't stop me.
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:36.740]  No, I didn't, because you said they were cool.
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.180]  Why would I stop you?
[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:40.720]  I was just happy that you were showing interest in something.
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:42.280]  I'm just like a dad.
[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:43.320]  I'm trying to support you.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.880]  It's like, oh, now you're into Shack?
[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:47.220]  Cool.
[01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:47.580]  Whatever.
[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:48.640]  I'll pretend to like Shack.
[01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:52.360]  However I can connect with my disaffected child.
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:53.060]  You know, whatever.
[01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:54.060]  Look out, Mark.
[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:55.280]  Here comes the Shack Attack.
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:58.200]  There are a bunch of these.
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:01.520]  I made a whole line of Shack Attack toys that are fantastic.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:02.840]  I like that it's...
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.180]  Attack is spelled with a Q.
[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:05.840]  Oh, it's because it's Shack.
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:07.300]  Oh, it comes with a...
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:08.720]  Shack stick.
[01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:09.960]  This looks like a big build.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.860]  I'm sorry, did you say it comes with a Shack stick?
[01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:13.680]  Yeah, it's a stick.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.760]  And I assume it's related to Shack in some way.
[01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:19.360]  Yo, it comes with a Shack stick.
[01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:22.100]  Oh, yeah, let's get into it.
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:22.380]  Okay.
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:23.440]  All right.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.420]  I try to have one of everything from Fuckface.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:28.940]  Sorry, can you hit that face?
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:29.440]  Thank you.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:32.020]  But I don't know that I can...
[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:33.820]  I don't know that that waffle bomb can go back.
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:34.580]  What do you mean?
[01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:35.840]  Did the AC turn on?
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:37.700]  Because it's gone right up my nose.
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:37.940]  Yeah.
[01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:38.840]  Like something happened.
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:41.580]  No, something happened is that I moved it from this side of the table to that side of the table.
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:42.480]  That was ages ago.
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:43.680]  I'm just getting it again.
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:44.440]  Oh, no, it's...
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:46.860]  You'll smell that for like a while.
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:47.440]  It's not...
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:49.580]  It doesn't let you stop smelling it.
[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:52.420]  At no point do you get to stop smelling it.
[01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:54.420]  It commands nasal attention.
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.360]  Can you slide that down, Eric, the hoop?
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:57.900]  Oh, yeah.
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:59.700]  Well, no, it...
[01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:01.180]  This is as far as it goes.
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:04.140]  I don't see how he's going to shoot that high.
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:05.780]  He's got...
[01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:06.400]  Look at his shack at...
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.040]  What do you mean?
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:08.160]  This is Shaquille O'Neal.
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:10.200]  He's seven feet tall, dude.
[01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:13.220]  Famed free throw artist, Shaquille O'Neal.
[01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:15.560]  He doesn't dunk in this toy.
[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:17.780]  He shoots from the free throw line.
[01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:20.580]  So, classic Shaq.
[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:22.440]  I looked into it.
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:25.460]  His career free throw percentage, I believe, was 53%.
[01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:26.740]  I would say it's right around...
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:28.120]  Probably right around that, yeah.
[01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:29.740]  That's why they called it Hack-a-Shaq.
[01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:30.160]  Yeah.
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:32.380]  Okay, let's...
[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:34.360]  Gotta make one of two to maintain the average.
[01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:36.940]  How does this go on?
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.320]  You'll figure it out.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:45.240]  In the meantime, why don't I open up something from the pack sack?
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:48.100]  Are there instructions or something?
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.080]  I hope not, man.
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:50.760]  Here's what we got.
[01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:57.320]  We got Pro Set Superstars music cards, so we can open up some music.
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:01.320]  Oh, I think I got those on the Rooster Teeth podcast, which you can watch every Monday live.
[01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:02.780]  Oh, that's true. We did open some up there.
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:05.580]  Oh, this is great.
[01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:07.180]  Joe Satriani.
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:08.020]  Ooh, baby.
[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:11.860]  The one, the only Cher.
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:13.900]  Man, I could turn back time.
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:15.680]  The London Choir Boys.
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:17.600]  My favorite artist.
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:21.120]  Dude, I got back to back.
[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:22.180]  Oh, shit.
[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:23.660]  The Ice, right there.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:24.440]  Hell yeah.
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.260]  We got U2.
[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:30.200]  We got Da Vinyls.
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:33.120]  They had that one song where she masturbated.
[01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:34.640]  And that was pretty much their career.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.900]  They had another song, too, but I don't think anybody remembers.
[01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:37.640]  The Police.
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:41.120]  Rigor Mortis.
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:41.940]  Sick.
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:45.240]  Ew, Lynyrd Skynyrd.
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.260]  What, ew?
[01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:48.100]  What's wrong with Skynyrd?
[01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:53.880]  I would argue that pack had more rad dudes in it than the rad dudes.
[01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:59.060]  I think that's a pretty safe argument to make.
[01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:00.500]  What are you doing over here, Gavin?
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:01.440]  Nothing.
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:01.920]  Okay.
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:02.480]  Okay.
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:03.460]  I love what's going on here.
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:05.040]  And then I open up Blondie.
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:07.540]  Everybody remembers the Sunday Funny Blondie.
[01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:09.880]  Apparently we got some, they made cards.
[01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:10.400]  What?
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:11.800]  No, it's, wait.
[01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:12.640]  Yeah, so we got a...
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:14.400]  Oh, I thought you were talking about the band Blondie.
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.200]  No, no, like the Sunday Funnies Blondie.
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:17.220]  There's Tootsie Woodley.
[01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:18.800]  I thought it was called Dagwood.
[01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:21.120]  Dagwood was her husband.
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:22.640]  There's Dean Young.
[01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:25.220]  When I think about you, I touch myself.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:29.660]  Oh, I don't want anybody else.
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:30.600]  Doing his thrusts.
[01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:31.420]  Yeah, I thought you'd know that one.
[01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:33.020]  Ooh, Cora Dithers.
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:38.180]  And, uh, I think I hate, I don't think I got a single Blondie in the whole fucking order.
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:39.520]  My least favorite cards we've opened.
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.640]  Not the rad dudes?
[01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:44.300]  No, the rad dudes were very, well, some of them were rad.
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:46.780]  Great text in the back, you could act out scenes.
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:48.420]  There was nothing of value to them.
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:49.960]  There was content in the rad dudes.
[01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:51.500]  Well, um...
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.500]  How do you guys feel about the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers?
[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:55.340]  Is it from the movie or from the show?
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:57.200]  Fuck if I know, I don't know either.
[01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:57.600]  The movie.
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:58.920]  We need to get some eye news.
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:22:59.700]  The movie.
[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:01.080]  The movie.
[01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:06.740]  You put up a real fight about not knowing, and all you had to do was read the thing you were holding.
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.420]  Adam, everybody remembers Adam.
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:09.380]  He's the Black Ranger, right?
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:10.660]  What a kick.
[01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:12.020]  Great kick.
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:13.880]  What the fuck is this?
[01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:14.180]  Let's see.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:15.720]  Wicked Wizard?
[01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:17.400]  Oh, it's Ivan Ooze.
[01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:19.440]  He's selling his shit.
[01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:20.720]  He's selling his ooze.
[01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:21.240]  He's evil.
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:22.500]  Fallen Leader.
[01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:26.020]  Lacky Charms.
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:26.620]  Oh!
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:27.660]  Goldar.
[01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:28.680]  And Tommy.
[01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:30.480]  Pretty cool.
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:32.720]  That dude.
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:35.580]  Can you get a close-up on that?
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:37.780]  Yeah, can you move those and get these?
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:38.440]  There we go.
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:40.100]  Can we, uh...
[01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:40.420]  Uh-huh.
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:44.400]  Oh, Ice Baby.
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:45.480]  Ice Ice Baby.
[01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:46.640]  You said Ice three times.
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:47.920]  No, I said Ice Ice Baby.
[01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:48.940]  No, he said it three times.
[01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:50.280]  No, I said it twice.
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:50.820]  Ice Baby.
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:51.940]  Ice Ice Baby.
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:56.300]  This is the first story we've told through cards.
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:57.160]  Congratulations.
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.660]  This is a whole new segment.
[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:02.380]  I wish I'd found the other card I was looking for a lot quicker.
[01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:03.100]  Come on, Geoff.
[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:03.700]  What are you doing?
[01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:04.980]  I fucking suck.
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:06.180]  All right, guys.
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:07.620]  Are you ready for the Shack Attack?
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:09.000]  Oh, I'm still ready.
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:09.300]  What?
[01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:10.120]  Come on.
[01:24:10.580 --> 01:24:11.580]  No, come on, Geoff.
[01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:14.780]  What the fuck?
[01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:17.300]  It hit Eric right on the head.
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:18.540]  Oh, I wish we had the white.
[01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:19.460]  Shack has so much power.
[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:20.900]  What about the, uh...
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:21.960]  What about the jib?
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:23.140]  Do you see it on the jib or no?
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:23.860]  Do we lose it?
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:24.620]  I bet we don't see it.
[01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:24.900]  Damn.
[01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:25.420]  All right.
[01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:26.740]  Let me try a little less power.
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:27.340]  A little less power.
[01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:28.540]  Whoa!
[01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:30.420]  That's close.
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:31.300]  That's a realistic toy.
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.580]  Yeah, this really is.
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:33.680]  It's like watching Shack do free throws.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:35.620]  No offense to Fred Flintstone, but...
[01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:36.100]  Oh!
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:37.680]  Yeah!
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:39.040]  Can I see how hard it will go?
[01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:39.360]  Yeah.
[01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.330]  Oh!
[01:24:50.130 --> 01:24:51.110]  Ay-yi-yi.
[01:24:51.190 --> 01:24:52.190]  That looked like it hurt, Gavin.
[01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:53.070]  That was cool.
[01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:55.870]  I've got that skin back eventually.
[01:24:56.170 --> 01:24:59.490]  Well, Andrew, your insistence on the Shack Attack game worked out.
[01:24:59.570 --> 01:25:01.230]  I think it was a wise decision.
[01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.850]  It was a big hit.
[01:25:02.050 --> 01:25:03.610]  Thank you for forcing us to buy that.
[01:25:04.930 --> 01:25:05.530]  But I did.
[01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:07.890]  Got a little bit left here.
[01:25:08.210 --> 01:25:08.410]  Uh-huh.
[01:25:08.710 --> 01:25:10.230]  We could do hockey with Andrew.
[01:25:10.710 --> 01:25:11.250]  Let's do some hockey for Andrew.
[01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.490]  Yeah.
[01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:12.070]  Let's do some hockey for Andrew.
[01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:15.090]  There's a 2001-2002 hockey cards he asked me to buy.
[01:25:15.090 --> 01:25:17.530]  Are you feeling good about 2001-2002?
[01:25:17.890 --> 01:25:18.930]  Is that when the Avalanche were good?
[01:25:19.090 --> 01:25:19.770]  2001-2002?
[01:25:19.870 --> 01:25:22.510]  Yeah, we're looking for an Andrew Castles card.
[01:25:22.530 --> 01:25:22.950]  Ooh, nice.
[01:25:23.290 --> 01:25:23.690]  From Vancouver Canucks.
[01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:24.090]  Uh-huh.
[01:25:24.610 --> 01:25:26.090]  And why are we looking for Andrew Castles?
[01:25:26.170 --> 01:25:27.410]  Is this that story you told me?
[01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:36.130]  Yeah, so when I was in Vancouver once on a trip, I met Andrew Castles at a pool and I swam with him and his kid.
[01:25:36.670 --> 01:25:36.970]  What?
[01:25:37.090 --> 01:25:38.250]  This would be...
[01:25:38.250 --> 01:25:39.250]  I met Andrew Castles.
[01:25:39.310 --> 01:25:39.990]  He's a hockey player.
[01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:41.310]  He played for the Canucks in 2001.
[01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:44.810]  Wait, so the reason that we're looking for it is because you went swimming with him?
[01:25:44.810 --> 01:25:45.330]  Sort of.
[01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:46.790]  Yeah, this is my chase card.
[01:25:46.930 --> 01:25:49.330]  Did you go swimming with him or did you go swimming with his kid?
[01:25:50.090 --> 01:25:50.670]  Both of them.
[01:25:50.730 --> 01:25:51.990]  We played tag in the pool.
[01:25:52.090 --> 01:25:53.490]  It was a competitive game.
[01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:56.470]  Well, he's a professional athlete, you know.
[01:25:56.810 --> 01:25:59.330]  And why are we hunting this down, though?
[01:26:00.370 --> 01:26:01.650]  Because he signed some...
[01:26:01.650 --> 01:26:01.830]  I met this...
[01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:03.770]  He gave me...
[01:26:03.770 --> 01:26:05.910]  Actually, that's more important to the story.
[01:26:06.090 --> 01:26:07.170]  That's a much more important point.
[01:26:07.230 --> 01:26:08.010]  I got his autograph.
[01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:12.930]  It's the only athlete's autograph I've gotten and I believe there are autograph cards of his in this set.
[01:26:12.930 --> 01:26:13.930]  Why did you...
[01:26:14.610 --> 01:26:16.690]  Why just tell that story?
[01:26:16.810 --> 01:26:18.790]  Because I forgot about that part.
[01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:20.310]  I just remember the pool part mainly.
[01:26:20.650 --> 01:26:21.470]  That's what I'm here for.
[01:26:21.650 --> 01:26:23.230]  I knew the story ahead of time.
[01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:24.310]  Is that because you're the host?
[01:26:26.690 --> 01:26:32.590]  But if you saw a famous person and had the opportunity to get an autograph or go swimming, what would you rather do?
[01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.810]  Both.
[01:26:34.730 --> 01:26:35.450]  Both worlds.
[01:26:35.730 --> 01:26:38.850]  That's the problem is it got wet in the pool.
[01:26:39.230 --> 01:26:40.050]  Oh no, my autograph.
[01:26:40.650 --> 01:26:44.810]  And so he thought, someday when I'm a grown-up, I'm going to force an American to buy me a box of cards.
[01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:47.930]  Forced is such a strong word.
[01:26:48.210 --> 01:26:49.030]  What is his name again?
[01:26:49.890 --> 01:26:50.610]  Andrew Castles.
[01:26:50.670 --> 01:26:51.210]  Andrew Castles.
[01:26:51.890 --> 01:26:53.250]  It would be crazy if it was the first card.
[01:26:53.670 --> 01:26:54.170]  Not though.
[01:26:54.490 --> 01:26:56.330]  That was Brian Leach.
[01:26:56.410 --> 01:26:57.130]  All right, let's see it.
[01:26:58.690 --> 01:26:59.490]  Tony Amante.
[01:26:59.810 --> 01:27:01.690]  Still on the lookout for lawyers and high-lags.
[01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:01.930]  Yep.
[01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:03.970]  And Gagneys and Gagners.
[01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:05.710]  Matt Sundin.
[01:27:06.030 --> 01:27:06.430]  Deane.
[01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:08.830]  Joseph Stumpel.
[01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:10.030]  Stumpel.
[01:27:10.130 --> 01:27:11.150]  All right, I'm pulling that aside.
[01:27:11.410 --> 01:27:13.130]  Stumpel is a fantastic name.
[01:27:13.230 --> 01:27:15.410]  Matt Sundin, one of the most hated players in Canucks history.
[01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:17.550]  Joseph played one season for them.
[01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:18.170]  It's terrible.
[01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:20.270]  Really? He just wasn't a good...
[01:27:20.710 --> 01:27:27.150]  He had a great career in Toronto and then he played for Vancouver for one season and it was a huge cap hit and it was a disaster.
[01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:29.490]  What is a C? Is he a center?
[01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:30.070]  Captain.
[01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:31.630]  C is for captain.
[01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:34.710]  Mike Dunham.
[01:27:35.150 --> 01:27:37.110]  What's this guy's name? Andrew Castles or something?
[01:27:37.110 --> 01:27:38.070]  Matt Pettinger.
[01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:40.130]  Oh, two S's. I see.
[01:27:40.690 --> 01:27:44.830]  Oh, Yaramir Yager. I remember him. I think I even said his name right.
[01:27:46.230 --> 01:27:47.410]  You did. You nailed it.
[01:27:48.110 --> 01:27:48.570]  There we go, bud.
[01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:50.630]  Then we got Joe Sackick. I've heard of him as well.
[01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:51.230]  Boom.
[01:27:51.930 --> 01:27:52.550]  Still in the league?
[01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:53.410]  Oh, no.
[01:27:54.030 --> 01:27:56.290]  Oh, I got a fucking redemption.
[01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.850]  Thanks, man.
[01:27:58.530 --> 01:27:59.950]  Was it in the way of something important?
[01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:01.550]  This sucks.
[01:28:02.090 --> 01:28:02.770]  Look at this.
[01:28:02.770 --> 01:28:08.850]  Congratulations. This card entitles you to receive Topps card number 340 from 0102 Topps.
[01:28:08.910 --> 01:28:09.770]  Is that like an IOU?
[01:28:10.370 --> 01:28:13.430]  Expiration date 7-30-2002.
[01:28:13.650 --> 01:28:18.050]  Will you look up Topps card 340 from 2001-2002 and see what we would have gotten?
[01:28:18.130 --> 01:28:18.250]  Yep.
[01:28:18.530 --> 01:28:19.150]  Yeah, that's called a redemption card.
[01:28:19.150 --> 01:28:22.790]  This is my redemption year. Having a redemption card is fitting.
[01:28:22.970 --> 01:28:24.530]  Why can I smell that suddenly?
[01:28:24.850 --> 01:28:25.570]  Luke Robitaille.
[01:28:25.650 --> 01:28:26.290]  Did you move it?
[01:28:26.410 --> 01:28:26.670]  No.
[01:28:26.970 --> 01:28:28.270]  Luke Robitaille is right there.
[01:28:28.490 --> 01:28:29.890]  I smell it. Why do I smell it?
[01:28:30.110 --> 01:28:30.890]  Oh, it's pretty bad.
[01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:31.570]  Get it out!
[01:28:32.970 --> 01:28:34.190]  It's near me.
[01:28:34.210 --> 01:28:34.790]  Oh, it's still over here.
[01:28:34.810 --> 01:28:35.930]  No, it's not. It's gone.
[01:28:38.430 --> 01:28:39.130]  Oh, no.
[01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:42.450]  I can just... I don't like it.
[01:28:43.230 --> 01:28:44.170]  It's really bad.
[01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:49.490]  By the way, those redemptions, I mean, I don't know much about hockey, but redemption cards are hard to get.
[01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:50.990]  I've only pulled one in my life.
[01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:56.190]  And it's really... it's a real fuck you when it's expired.
[01:28:56.290 --> 01:28:58.730]  Yeah, is that they just couldn't print it in time or what? Or is it like a thing?
[01:28:58.730 --> 01:29:03.010]  Yeah, no, they can't print it in time or they can't get the autograph signed in time.
[01:29:03.150 --> 01:29:06.730]  So they'll put the redemption card. Very common. Very common to do it.
[01:29:06.730 --> 01:29:15.030]  Number 340 is Topps Jukka Hentunen.
[01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:17.910]  He was on the Calgary Flames. It's his rookie card.
[01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:20.610]  The listed price is $5.14.
[01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:23.090]  So we could have made a profit.
[01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:25.170]  Steve Yazerman, I assume.
[01:29:25.330 --> 01:29:25.930]  They got the Yaz?
[01:29:26.730 --> 01:29:28.690]  Sergei Zubov. Do you know all these people, Andrew?
[01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:30.130]  I know some of them.
[01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:33.090]  Steve Yazerman is the GM of Tampa Bay, I believe.
[01:29:33.250 --> 01:29:34.270]  The general manager?
[01:29:34.590 --> 01:29:35.290]  In the playoffs right now.
[01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.870]  Steve Ruckin.
[01:29:38.810 --> 01:29:39.610]  Rob Niedermayer.
[01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:43.990]  Mario Returns. I assume that's Mario Lemieux.
[01:29:44.930 --> 01:29:45.370]  Yeah, Lemieux.
[01:29:45.710 --> 01:29:46.350]  There you go.
[01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.990]  Where did he go?
[01:29:47.450 --> 01:29:48.130]  He went to the store.
[01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:50.350]  To get some cigarettes. And he came back.
[01:29:52.150 --> 01:29:52.950]  Chris McAlpine.
[01:29:53.770 --> 01:29:56.110]  Ooh, John Madden and Randy McKay.
[01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:57.890]  Different John Madden, I'm assuming.
[01:29:58.190 --> 01:29:58.870]  No, that's the same one.
[01:29:59.470 --> 01:30:00.170]  That's the same John Madden.
[01:30:00.190 --> 01:30:02.110]  It's the same John Madden. I'm putting it over there as a big John Madden fan.
[01:30:03.930 --> 01:30:05.490]  Is there a Madden NHL game?
[01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:06.430]  Mike Madonna.
[01:30:07.210 --> 01:30:08.390]  Yes, there is.
[01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:09.130]  Awesome.
[01:30:10.510 --> 01:30:11.930]  What's the name of the guy we're getting again?
[01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:13.750]  Andrew Castles.
[01:30:14.410 --> 01:30:18.630]  I have it here, and I could not for the life of me remember.
[01:30:18.930 --> 01:30:19.950]  Andrew Castles.
[01:30:20.850 --> 01:30:21.570]  Derek Morris.
[01:30:23.330 --> 01:30:24.210]  Peter Worrell.
[01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:25.890]  Are you a big Peter Worrell fan, Andrew?
[01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:28.050]  Uh, never heard of him.
[01:30:28.130 --> 01:30:29.110]  Seems like a rad dude, though.
[01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:31.090]  That seems like an insult.
[01:30:32.710 --> 01:30:34.070]  Sandus Ozula something.
[01:30:35.850 --> 01:30:36.730]  Jeremy Roenick.
[01:30:36.890 --> 01:30:37.230]  Renick?
[01:30:37.810 --> 01:30:38.590]  Kenick? Konick?
[01:30:39.310 --> 01:30:40.650]  It's under my chair!
[01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:42.850]  Son of a bitch!
[01:30:43.010 --> 01:30:45.950]  I slid it. I rolled it perfectly. It stopped right under you.
[01:30:46.170 --> 01:30:48.570]  I thought you had another Mario Returns, but this one's...
[01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.770]  I don't know.
[01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.750]  Brent Sopel.
[01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:56.950]  Ooh, Alexey Kovalev. He's a star of the game.
[01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:01.890]  And these two dudes.
[01:31:02.350 --> 01:31:03.730]  Andrew, are we excited about these guys?
[01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:07.890]  I don't know who these guys are, the old, like, Canadiens players.
[01:31:08.330 --> 01:31:10.190]  I'm not... I'm familiar with the stars of the game.
[01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:12.190]  Brent Sopel is an okay defenseman for Vancouver.
[01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.770]  Oh, God.
[01:31:14.610 --> 01:31:15.910]  Why would you do that to someone else?
[01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:18.550]  I'm not trying to do it to anybody else, I'm just trying to undo it to us.
[01:31:18.550 --> 01:31:20.790]  Uh, we got about...
[01:31:23.170 --> 01:31:27.850]  You should buy store.roosterteeth.com if you want to get one of your own.
[01:31:28.910 --> 01:31:31.850]  It was the worst rated item in the entire store.
[01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:33.790]  Andrew, have you had one? Have you sniffed it?
[01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:39.210]  I bought one. I got two of them. I'm afraid to open it based on how...
[01:31:39.210 --> 01:31:41.670]  I would love for you to open it right now.
[01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:42.450]  On the show.
[01:31:42.710 --> 01:31:44.130]  I'm gonna grab it. We'll do it.
[01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:47.170]  I like that he bought one. We can send you stuff.
[01:31:47.170 --> 01:31:48.230]  Kelly Buckburger.
[01:31:48.410 --> 01:31:51.450]  Well, if we could find where it's supposed to go.
[01:31:51.690 --> 01:31:53.530]  Rob, like, wouldn't it be awesome if I found it?
[01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.870]  Yeah, then shredded it.
[01:31:54.990 --> 01:32:06.950]  Manny Legace, Lee Goran, Eric Charizard, Mika Nornanonan, Bob Booger, and Robert Wayne.
[01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:11.530]  This is a good stream. People are watching this and they're going, I'm learning a lot.
[01:32:11.790 --> 01:32:14.930]  What happens if you join this halfway through and you don't know?
[01:32:14.930 --> 01:32:16.270]  I can't...
[01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:17.750]  How long does it take for you to get what it is?
[01:32:17.790 --> 01:32:18.430]  No idea.
[01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:22.290]  Well, we didn't start breaking cards for the first 20 minutes, so...
[01:32:22.290 --> 01:32:24.950]  Joe Sackick again. Everybody loves him, right? He's a good player.
[01:32:25.770 --> 01:32:27.010]  Keep that one. Sackick.
[01:32:28.090 --> 01:32:28.450]  Teppo...
[01:32:28.450 --> 01:32:29.050]  Sackick is good.
[01:32:29.230 --> 01:32:33.330]  Num-a-num-a-num. Num-a-num-a-num. M&M. Teppo M&M-a-num-a-num.
[01:32:34.830 --> 01:32:35.790]  Butchering these names.
[01:32:37.070 --> 01:32:37.430]  Teppo...
[01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:38.590]  Opening this thing.
[01:32:38.690 --> 01:32:39.230]  Num-a-num-a-num.
[01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:40.330]  Why don't you just read it?
[01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:41.090]  Say his fucking name.
[01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:43.790]  Num-a-num.
[01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:44.510]  Open.
[01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:45.610]  Alright, hey, Andrew?
[01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:47.110]  Nicholas Shitstorm.
[01:32:47.290 --> 01:32:47.530]  Can I have it open?
[01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:49.270]  Yep, okay. And let's take a smell.
[01:32:49.810 --> 01:32:51.250]  Alright, let's deep whiff.
[01:32:57.390 --> 01:32:59.170]  Oh my god!
[01:33:00.050 --> 01:33:01.790]  Right? Terrible!
[01:33:02.250 --> 01:33:07.790]  It's so strong right out of the package. When he said big whiff, it's like, oh no.
[01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:09.790]  It's so strong.
[01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:13.030]  We're smelling stuff together across nations right now.
[01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.550]  That's true.
[01:33:13.670 --> 01:33:15.010]  This is international smelling.
[01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:19.690]  It smells like the, like, detergent section of a grocery store.
[01:33:19.930 --> 01:33:20.630]  Like, it's just...
[01:33:20.630 --> 01:33:21.250]  Hey!
[01:33:21.810 --> 01:33:24.030]  How would you know? You're only allowed to go to the in-caps.
[01:33:24.210 --> 01:33:25.350]  You can't go down the aisles.
[01:33:27.850 --> 01:33:30.670]  I like that every description of it is completely different.
[01:33:30.710 --> 01:33:31.090]  Absolutely.
[01:33:31.570 --> 01:33:35.310]  Oh, here's Ed Belfort. I've heard of him. He's a Dallas star.
[01:33:35.470 --> 01:33:35.930]  The Belfort?
[01:33:35.930 --> 01:33:36.530]  He owned the game.
[01:33:37.170 --> 01:33:38.390]  I think I might like this.
[01:33:39.550 --> 01:33:41.010]  You like the smell, right?
[01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:42.610]  I think I might like this.
[01:33:43.850 --> 01:33:46.690]  People should... hey, store.roosterteeth.com if you want to buy one.
[01:33:46.930 --> 01:33:51.390]  And then do the... hey, film yourself smelling it, and then post it on Instagram or tweet it at us.
[01:33:51.770 --> 01:33:53.950]  Because I gotta know what you guys think.
[01:33:54.290 --> 01:33:57.790]  Do what Andrew did. Open it, and then take a big whiff.
[01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:59.150]  And film yourself doing it.
[01:33:59.230 --> 01:34:03.390]  Yeah, and it sort of leaves you with... imagine if you had a migraine about eight hours ago.
[01:34:03.490 --> 01:34:04.530]  That sort of feeling.
[01:34:04.650 --> 01:34:09.970]  It would be... the best thing you could do is if you could film yourself smelling it for the first time.
[01:34:09.970 --> 01:34:10.210]  Yes.
[01:34:10.210 --> 01:34:11.030]  And put that up live for us to see it.
[01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:12.410]  It really, like...
[01:34:12.410 --> 01:34:13.070]  We did it for you.
[01:34:13.190 --> 01:34:13.390]  Yep.
[01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:14.850]  Oh, man.
[01:34:14.970 --> 01:34:15.770]  That was in my car.
[01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:16.530]  It's still in my car.
[01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:18.430]  It just doesn't smell anymore, so it looks cool.
[01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:19.450]  Theon lost.
[01:34:19.570 --> 01:34:20.510]  Like, it doesn't even last long?
[01:34:20.710 --> 01:34:21.010]  No, no.
[01:34:21.170 --> 01:34:21.770]  It lasts... hey.
[01:34:22.130 --> 01:34:24.430]  It lasted longer than you wanted it to.
[01:34:24.630 --> 01:34:25.110]  Nicholas Lidstrom.
[01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:26.970]  You know how we could still smell it?
[01:34:27.370 --> 01:34:28.030]  It's like that.
[01:34:28.710 --> 01:34:30.630]  How do you know if somebody's a... oh, we got a gagney!
[01:34:31.290 --> 01:34:31.950]  Oh, maybe!
[01:34:32.290 --> 01:34:32.890]  Put it in the gagneys.
[01:34:34.370 --> 01:34:35.010]  Darcy Tucker.
[01:34:35.430 --> 01:34:37.090]  How do you know if there's a rookie or not?
[01:34:37.150 --> 01:34:37.710]  They don't seem to say.
[01:34:37.810 --> 01:34:38.130]  John McClare.
[01:34:38.130 --> 01:34:39.890]  It says NHL Prospect, I think.
[01:34:40.730 --> 01:34:42.230]  Jock and Heck.
[01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:43.710]  That's right.
[01:34:44.190 --> 01:34:45.910]  Rico Fada.
[01:34:47.110 --> 01:34:47.830]  Jeremy Riddick.
[01:34:48.210 --> 01:34:49.030]  Rico Fada?
[01:34:50.110 --> 01:34:52.410]  Are you, like, keeping a bunch of these?
[01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:55.010]  These are the ones that I find interesting.
[01:34:55.630 --> 01:34:56.270]  That's a lot.
[01:34:56.890 --> 01:34:57.710]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:34:57.750 --> 01:35:02.590]  Do you feel like, of everything we've opened today, this is how interesting it's been?
[01:35:02.710 --> 01:35:04.970]  I mean, I'm seeing about six or seven rad dudes in there.
[01:35:05.550 --> 01:35:06.290]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:35:06.490 --> 01:35:09.590]  The pile's big because this is a thick pile.
[01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:10.670]  Okay, take that out of it.
[01:35:10.750 --> 01:35:11.750]  Let's see how big the pile is.
[01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:12.690]  But these are all...
[01:35:12.690 --> 01:35:13.350]  Here's what I'm doing.
[01:35:13.450 --> 01:35:16.270]  I'm pulling aside all the hockey cards that could be worth something so I can look them up.
[01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:19.070]  And then the other sides, I got, like, the Vanilla Ice story.
[01:35:19.390 --> 01:35:23.270]  I got some rad dudes that I want to go through, and we'll see which ones are worth everything.
[01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:24.390]  Gotta have that Roy.
[01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:26.090]  Got the best wrestling cards.
[01:35:26.450 --> 01:35:29.330]  Got the best, obviously, the best Forest Whitaker.
[01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:30.810]  And then, uh...
[01:35:30.810 --> 01:35:31.230]  Dan Craig.
[01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:32.910]  Dan Craig, and then some autographs.
[01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:33.690]  It adds up fast.
[01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:34.930]  It really does.
[01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:35.210]  Yeah.
[01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:37.990]  Did you keep the one of Daniel Craig on holiday with some beach girls?
[01:35:38.010 --> 01:35:39.090]  I don't know what...
[01:35:39.090 --> 01:35:39.730]  No, that's a good one.
[01:35:39.730 --> 01:35:40.090]  Don't worry.
[01:35:40.210 --> 01:35:40.470]  I don't know.
[01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:41.230]  It's over here somewhere.
[01:35:41.410 --> 01:35:42.170]  It's in one of those piles.
[01:35:42.190 --> 01:35:42.870]  That was interesting.
[01:35:43.110 --> 01:35:46.850]  I'm going to start sneaking cards into your Marcus Smart cards.
[01:35:47.150 --> 01:35:47.810]  And you're not gonna...
[01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:49.390]  I will know, because I go through them a lot.
[01:35:52.730 --> 01:35:54.430]  You go through them a lot?
[01:35:54.610 --> 01:35:55.770]  Well, because I have to add new cards in.
[01:35:55.870 --> 01:35:56.630]  I buy them constantly.
[01:35:57.210 --> 01:36:00.370]  You know when you add one or something, and you have to look through all the old ones?
[01:36:00.670 --> 01:36:02.390]  Well, you gotta find out where they...
[01:36:03.150 --> 01:36:03.290]  What?
[01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.510]  Yeah.
[01:36:04.510 --> 01:36:05.830]  You gotta find out where they go.
[01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:07.330]  You gotta look through them to get them right.
[01:36:07.330 --> 01:36:09.390]  Emily was right to call these your treasures.
[01:36:09.810 --> 01:36:10.670]  Byron Defoe.
[01:36:12.270 --> 01:36:12.990]  Johan Hedberg.
[01:36:13.130 --> 01:36:14.630]  He's Mitch Hedberg's cousin, I believe.
[01:36:15.570 --> 01:36:16.290]  Andrew Raycroft.
[01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:17.090]  That was close.
[01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:17.850]  He was an Andrew.
[01:36:18.610 --> 01:36:18.770]  Yep.
[01:36:18.770 --> 01:36:20.170]  Thomas Divisic.
[01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:23.090]  Oh, I got another Redemption card!
[01:36:23.930 --> 01:36:24.030]  Great!
[01:36:24.710 --> 01:36:25.270]  All right.
[01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:26.070]  Is that one expired?
[01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:26.670]  Turgenberg.
[01:36:26.930 --> 01:36:27.910]  It's probably the same time.
[01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.230]  Oh, yeah.
[01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:30.730]  So we got 21 minutes left on the stream.
[01:36:31.190 --> 01:36:32.170]  I'm gonna open a couple more of these.
[01:36:32.290 --> 01:36:35.650]  Then we have my big chase card at the end, which I can talk about.
[01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:37.250]  But I only have...
[01:36:37.250 --> 01:36:38.850]  I can only afford six packs.
[01:36:40.290 --> 01:36:41.390]  We'll talk about why.
[01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:43.310]  Alexei Kovalev.
[01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:44.410]  Everybody loves him.
[01:36:45.630 --> 01:36:46.430]  Milan Hedjuguk.
[01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:50.370]  I gotta officially reverse my position on the air freshener.
[01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:51.370]  It smells terrible.
[01:36:51.450 --> 01:36:54.910]  I think what happened was it blew out my nose, that initial big whiff.
[01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:57.010]  I couldn't smell anything for a while.
[01:36:57.570 --> 01:36:58.670]  Senses are coming back.
[01:36:58.690 --> 01:37:01.210]  As your nose rebuilds, the horror comes back.
[01:37:01.230 --> 01:37:04.410]  I'm gonna just put it at my desk and hope it...
[01:37:04.410 --> 01:37:04.510]  There.
[01:37:04.770 --> 01:37:05.530]  We have another Gagney.
[01:37:05.810 --> 01:37:06.990]  Congratulations for the Gagney.
[01:37:07.190 --> 01:37:08.470]  Eric, can you reset those pins?
[01:37:09.170 --> 01:37:09.490]  Oh, hell yeah.
[01:37:09.670 --> 01:37:11.150]  Daniel Alfredson.
[01:37:12.270 --> 01:37:14.070]  Oh, if you put the monkeys, do it.
[01:37:16.710 --> 01:37:20.270]  Geoff Halpern, who I guess is related to Jim.
[01:37:22.610 --> 01:37:23.770]  Brendan Morrow.
[01:37:25.230 --> 01:37:26.830]  Antini Juicy Nimi.
[01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:27.450]  I'm getting better.
[01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:29.950]  Antini Juicy Nimi?
[01:37:30.330 --> 01:37:31.370]  AntiJuicy Nimi.
[01:37:32.230 --> 01:37:33.110]  AntiJuicy Nimi.
[01:37:33.610 --> 01:37:35.310]  I feel like I'm saying something offensive.
[01:37:35.650 --> 01:37:36.070]  It's really hard.
[01:37:36.150 --> 01:37:37.770]  AntiJuicy... Gavin, how would you say this?
[01:37:40.810 --> 01:37:41.810]  AntiJuicy Nimi.
[01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:43.870]  I'm gonna save AntiJuicy Nimi.
[01:37:46.090 --> 01:37:47.170]  Rostilov Kloboska.
[01:37:47.210 --> 01:37:48.730]  Sounds like a character from Crown of Crushers.
[01:37:49.170 --> 01:37:49.870]  That's not bad.
[01:37:50.010 --> 01:37:50.710]  Rick Barry.
[01:37:50.930 --> 01:37:52.090]  What a boring hockey name.
[01:37:54.190 --> 01:37:55.270]  Brad Izbister.
[01:37:57.670 --> 01:38:00.370]  359 was Ty Kunklin.
[01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:02.650]  Bad play.
[01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:05.190]  It's part of the Redemption Rookies set.
[01:38:08.130 --> 01:38:09.210]  Certainly annoying.
[01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:10.550]  Got an awful lot of those in here.
[01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:11.650]  Steve Sullivan.
[01:38:11.890 --> 01:38:13.270]  Oh, here's a Brad Richards.
[01:38:13.870 --> 01:38:14.550]  Do we like him?
[01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.870]  Chris Simon.
[01:38:18.230 --> 01:38:19.190]  Patrick Elias.
[01:38:19.770 --> 01:38:20.630]  Geoff Hackett.
[01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:21.370]  Buddy Hackett.
[01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:22.670]  A lot of people don't know that.
[01:38:23.610 --> 01:38:24.510]  Mike Greer.
[01:38:24.590 --> 01:38:27.650]  Oh, by the way, apparently I may have said that Cecil Fielder's dead.
[01:38:27.930 --> 01:38:28.670]  I guess he's not.
[01:38:29.730 --> 01:38:30.410]  Not dead.
[01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:32.870]  So, the second official...
[01:38:34.930 --> 01:38:36.390]  Why did you think he was dead?
[01:38:38.130 --> 01:38:38.610]  Face.
[01:38:39.290 --> 01:38:39.770]  Retraction.
[01:38:39.970 --> 01:38:41.970]  I retract that Cecil Fielder's dead.
[01:38:42.670 --> 01:38:44.250]  Why were there so many deaths?
[01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:44.590]  Andreas Ligia.
[01:38:44.710 --> 01:38:46.010]  I just misremembered that.
[01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:47.190]  It's 57.
[01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:48.270]  You know what I bet it is?
[01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:51.330]  I bet it's like a Mandela effect.
[01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:52.730]  I bet he died in my time one.
[01:38:53.770 --> 01:38:55.250]  Mika Kip Ruskakoff.
[01:38:55.630 --> 01:38:56.930]  Ooh, Mario Lemieux.
[01:38:57.310 --> 01:38:58.390]  Everybody loves Mario Lemieux.
[01:38:58.410 --> 01:38:59.410]  Are you still smelling it, Andrew?
[01:39:00.170 --> 01:39:01.250]  I am still smelling it.
[01:39:01.330 --> 01:39:05.070]  I'm wondering if I burn it, would it make it go away or will that just be worse?
[01:39:05.710 --> 01:39:08.090]  What you can do, if you don't want it there anymore,
[01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:11.610]  you can put it on the other side of one of your doors.
[01:39:11.610 --> 01:39:14.630]  They're all located at the...
[01:39:14.630 --> 01:39:15.410]  They're at the top.
[01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:16.050]  They're at the top.
[01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:18.310]  The doors are at the top.
[01:39:18.570 --> 01:39:18.970]  Upcoming...
[01:39:18.970 --> 01:39:20.450]  You guys are teasing.
[01:39:21.230 --> 01:39:22.210]  That's two from this.
[01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:23.050]  That's two away.
[01:39:23.150 --> 01:39:23.990]  That's two away.
[01:39:24.290 --> 01:39:25.710]  You can't be talking about the top doors.
[01:39:27.450 --> 01:39:28.250]  That is...
[01:39:28.250 --> 01:39:28.970]  Standard windows.
[01:39:29.670 --> 01:39:32.950]  One of the more frustrating conversations we've had in recent memory.
[01:39:33.010 --> 01:39:33.690]  That's what that was.
[01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:35.690]  That was an annoyed Geoff conversation.
[01:39:36.150 --> 01:39:37.830]  If you light it on fire, it's only going to make it...
[01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:39.710]  If I light it on fire, does it make it worse?
[01:39:39.730 --> 01:39:39.970]  Yes.
[01:39:39.970 --> 01:39:41.090]  Does it unleash the smell?
[01:39:41.110 --> 01:39:42.330]  No, no, no. It'll probably be better.
[01:39:42.330 --> 01:39:44.030]  You don't have a fire extinguisher.
[01:39:44.370 --> 01:39:45.870]  You have one.
[01:39:46.050 --> 01:39:47.810]  I already have a fire going.
[01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:50.170]  I'll just throw this in.
[01:39:50.330 --> 01:39:50.890]  Wait, hang on.
[01:39:51.250 --> 01:39:52.450]  What are the chances...
[01:39:52.450 --> 01:39:53.830]  You already have a fire going?
[01:39:54.210 --> 01:39:56.330]  Yeah, there's already some fire going next to me.
[01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:59.390]  What are the chances that this conversation goes from this into Andrew going,
[01:39:59.490 --> 01:40:00.370]  Well, I always have a fire going.
[01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:03.590]  You guys don't keep an atomic flame in your apartment?
[01:40:03.690 --> 01:40:04.930]  Why do you have a fire going?
[01:40:05.330 --> 01:40:06.130]  I'm a candle guy.
[01:40:06.450 --> 01:40:07.350]  I'm a big candle guy.
[01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:09.070]  I got a candle lit right next to me.
[01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:10.030]  We got the flames going.
[01:40:10.170 --> 01:40:11.290]  I can just throw this in here.
[01:40:11.950 --> 01:40:14.290]  What flavor of candle is it?
[01:40:14.850 --> 01:40:16.090]  Let me spin.
[01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:18.310]  It is a juicy red mango, Eric.
[01:40:18.370 --> 01:40:19.150]  Thank you for asking.
[01:40:19.250 --> 01:40:20.350]  Should we make a waffle candle?
[01:40:20.590 --> 01:40:25.090]  We should make a candle that is the smell of this air freshener.
[01:40:25.850 --> 01:40:27.890]  I'm gonna put the air freshener in the candle.
[01:40:28.030 --> 01:40:28.330]  What?
[01:40:29.290 --> 01:40:29.670]  Okay.
[01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:31.250]  I was looking for a fire sound effect.
[01:40:31.250 --> 01:40:33.090]  I got a shopmaster, Joe Sackick.
[01:40:33.710 --> 01:40:34.850]  This might be a problem.
[01:40:35.110 --> 01:40:36.610]  Yes. No, it is, because it's a fire.
[01:40:40.490 --> 01:40:41.630]  What the fuck was that?
[01:40:43.230 --> 01:40:44.250]  I'm putting it in.
[01:40:44.930 --> 01:40:45.250]  Okay.
[01:40:46.710 --> 01:40:49.490]  Well, no, I have a smoke. I will set the smoke detector off.
[01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:50.650]  Right. No, we know that.
[01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:51.710]  Yeah, no, we know that.
[01:40:51.810 --> 01:40:54.390]  I'll wait until the end, and then I'll be able to walk away with it.
[01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.630]  Great.
[01:40:54.650 --> 01:40:57.650]  So, then we have 17 minutes left. We got a couple things to get through, including that.
[01:40:57.650 --> 01:40:59.270]  I think maybe we only have 10 minutes left.
[01:40:59.370 --> 01:41:00.430]  Yeah, maybe we have 10 minutes left.
[01:41:00.970 --> 01:41:03.010]  So, this will be the last pack of these we open.
[01:41:03.670 --> 01:41:08.070]  We haven't got your card yet, Andrew, but don't worry, we still have half a box to open at a future time.
[01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:09.870]  Wade Rettman.
[01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:10.770]  I'm in a pickle. What do you want?
[01:41:11.330 --> 01:41:12.430]  Trevor Letowski.
[01:41:12.670 --> 01:41:13.310]  That wasn't me, Andrew.
[01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:14.510]  Rick and Morty?
[01:41:14.730 --> 01:41:16.090]  No, that was...
[01:41:16.090 --> 01:41:17.070]  Derek Gustafson.
[01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:19.650]  Black. Blue.
[01:41:20.190 --> 01:41:21.230]  Colin White.
[01:41:21.450 --> 01:41:21.670]  Black.
[01:41:21.870 --> 01:41:25.230]  Oh, Alexey Kovalov owns the game.
[01:41:25.570 --> 01:41:27.930]  Jack. Black. Jack.
[01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:32.590]  Gavin has my soundboard, Andrew. That's not me.
[01:41:33.050 --> 01:41:34.230]  I can see.
[01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:35.070]  All right.
[01:41:35.310 --> 01:41:35.470]  What?
[01:41:35.570 --> 01:41:37.310]  Here's what we have left.
[01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.410]  What?
[01:41:38.030 --> 01:41:38.350]  Black.
[01:41:38.650 --> 01:41:38.970]  Jack.
[01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:40.710]  I have two things I'd like to open.
[01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:43.370]  I'll take a little bit of time with them.
[01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:45.050]  I teased something last time.
[01:41:45.050 --> 01:41:45.230]  Yes, yes.
[01:41:45.290 --> 01:41:47.050]  I'd like to close on that. Well, we'd like to close on Andrew.
[01:41:47.490 --> 01:41:52.670]  But before that, the last pack we'll open, I still have the single pack...
[01:41:53.590 --> 01:41:56.490]  the single pack of Grease cards.
[01:41:56.630 --> 01:41:58.390]  I teased this in the last one.
[01:42:02.590 --> 01:42:06.590]  First crush I ever had in my entire life was Rizzo, and it was one of these cards.
[01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:12.430]  So if I can get the Stocker Channing Rizzo card, it'll be like reclaiming my first boner.
[01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:13.630]  Oh, get the boner back.
[01:42:13.710 --> 01:42:14.210]  It'd be awesome.
[01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:17.790]  Grease trading cards, 1978, 66 complete.
[01:42:18.610 --> 01:42:20.730]  66 card, complete series one.
[01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:22.470]  $9.99.
[01:42:22.710 --> 01:42:25.070]  I want to rip it. That's where the fun is.
[01:42:25.390 --> 01:42:26.930]  And then here's my big chase card, okay?
[01:42:27.050 --> 01:42:27.850]  For this week.
[01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:35.450]  I have here six packs of Prism 2015-2016 NBA.
[01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:41.450]  These six fucking packs of cards, which I bought recently, cost...
[01:42:44.190 --> 01:42:44.990]  like $400.
[01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:47.190]  Shut up!
[01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.670]  $80.
[01:42:48.270 --> 01:42:51.050]  You came in today, and you're like, we gotta figure out how to like...
[01:42:51.050 --> 01:42:54.590]  this gotta be like a show, because we have to get some budget behind it, because I can't keep buying this stuff.
[01:42:54.750 --> 01:42:59.570]  And you spent $400 on six packs.
[01:42:59.890 --> 01:43:02.910]  What do you think the budget's going to be for this show?
[01:43:03.230 --> 01:43:04.470]  I don't know.
[01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:06.250]  It's not going to be that, thank you.
[01:43:06.350 --> 01:43:07.350]  It's not going to be that.
[01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:08.230]  Here's the deal.
[01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:09.710]  That's crazy!
[01:43:09.710 --> 01:43:11.210]  Here's what I'm falling back on.
[01:43:12.510 --> 01:43:14.250]  We'll sell some stuff, some merch.
[01:43:15.050 --> 01:43:16.250]  And also, I...
[01:43:16.250 --> 01:43:16.930]  How many...
[01:43:16.930 --> 01:43:19.410]  We got bats to sell, we got waffle bombs.
[01:43:19.550 --> 01:43:21.250]  These fucking waffle bombs you think we're gonna sell?
[01:43:21.370 --> 01:43:21.870]  Also, how about this?
[01:43:21.890 --> 01:43:22.990]  How much budget can we get?
[01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:24.170]  Let me think about that.
[01:43:25.610 --> 01:43:28.370]  Here's my counter-argument to the budget problem.
[01:43:28.910 --> 01:43:29.030]  Blue.
[01:43:31.050 --> 01:43:32.070]  Didn't they create this company?
[01:43:32.430 --> 01:43:34.690]  Shouldn't I be able to do... a little bit?
[01:43:35.710 --> 01:43:37.450]  A little bit? You're already doing it.
[01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:39.170]  Yeah, but I'm buying! It's all out of my fucking pocket!
[01:43:39.190 --> 01:43:41.930]  You bought $400 for six packs of cards.
[01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:43.730]  I'm not saying we can't do this.
[01:43:43.770 --> 01:43:44.530]  But do you know why?
[01:43:44.990 --> 01:43:45.890]  Do you know what I'm going for?
[01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:47.030]  Probably Marcus Smart.
[01:43:47.250 --> 01:43:48.930]  No, no, no, this is the year before...
[01:43:49.330 --> 01:43:50.310]  No, no, this is the second year.
[01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:51.350]  Sorry, that was a crazy guess.
[01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:52.070]  This is the second year.
[01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:57.830]  I'm going for a Chris Kamen, what's affectionately on Reddit called, a Chris Kamen White Walker card.
[01:43:57.830 --> 01:44:01.630]  I don't know if you know who Chris Kamen is, but he was a very, very white NBA player.
[01:44:01.770 --> 01:44:02.790]  I think he was a center, probably.
[01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:05.430]  Had a big ginger beard, kind of like Jack.
[01:44:06.290 --> 01:44:07.830]  And just a lumbering man.
[01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:10.710]  Was playing for the Portland Trailblazers, I believe, in 2015, 2016.
[01:44:11.230 --> 01:44:16.110]  And he just has a card in this set that he looks like a White Walker from Game of Thrones.
[01:44:16.770 --> 01:44:20.470]  And so they call it, I saw it on Reddit, they call it the Kamen White Walker card.
[01:44:20.730 --> 01:44:21.490]  It's worth about a dollar.
[01:44:22.590 --> 01:44:24.250]  You just want it? Why don't you just buy it?
[01:44:24.750 --> 01:44:25.730]  Well, because I want to get this way.
[01:44:26.410 --> 01:44:27.050]  No, this is cooler.
[01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:31.230]  The whole point of ripping packs is to get the card you want from the pack.
[01:44:32.330 --> 01:44:32.970]  Yeah, baby!
[01:44:33.530 --> 01:44:34.410]  Thank you, Eric, I appreciate it.
[01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:35.090]  Definitely not me.
[01:44:35.690 --> 01:44:36.930]  So, we're going to go ahead and open these.
[01:44:38.930 --> 01:44:43.810]  Also, and the reason these cards are expensive, I believe Carl Anthony Towns rookie is in here.
[01:44:44.330 --> 01:44:46.350]  Devin Booker rookie, which is a very big deal.
[01:44:46.570 --> 01:44:47.590]  Are you going to open all of these?
[01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.970]  Yeah.
[01:44:48.090 --> 01:44:49.710]  We're going to see $400 get opened right now?
[01:44:49.770 --> 01:44:49.970]  Yeah.
[01:44:50.490 --> 01:44:52.230]  Have you guys been watching the playoffs?
[01:44:52.510 --> 01:44:52.710]  Yeah.
[01:44:52.750 --> 01:44:55.870]  Did you see Devin Booker get his nose broken in three places?
[01:44:55.870 --> 01:44:58.350]  I've been watching Chris Paul not play and then play.
[01:44:58.410 --> 01:45:00.370]  And then Chris Paul play Rusty last night.
[01:45:00.430 --> 01:45:04.530]  Yeah, and then play and then get beat by like 14.
[01:45:04.730 --> 01:45:07.550]  So, here we go. We're looking for the Cayman White Walker.
[01:45:07.690 --> 01:45:10.330]  It'd be cool to get a Devin Booker rookie that's worth a couple thousand as well.
[01:45:10.650 --> 01:45:14.390]  But what we really want is the Cayman White Walker.
[01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:15.150]  That's how we make it back.
[01:45:15.170 --> 01:45:16.870]  So, we got Novitskiy.
[01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:18.510]  Whatever smile you're...
[01:45:18.510 --> 01:45:18.750]  Dirt.
[01:45:19.730 --> 01:45:21.070]  We got Derrick Williams.
[01:45:21.930 --> 01:45:23.650]  Oh, DeLon Wright rookie, great.
[01:45:25.410 --> 01:45:27.970]  Thomas Robinson looks like a wave parallel.
[01:45:28.230 --> 01:45:28.930]  That's pretty cool.
[01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.830]  Sick.
[01:45:30.030 --> 01:45:31.270]  That's a nice card, actually.
[01:45:31.770 --> 01:45:32.090]  Whoa.
[01:45:32.650 --> 01:45:33.810]  I don't know who Thomas Robinson is.
[01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:35.210]  What do you mean? You got his wave parallel.
[01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.850]  Yeah, I do.
[01:45:36.710 --> 01:45:37.790]  Looks like an orange wave.
[01:45:38.050 --> 01:45:38.890]  You kept all of those?
[01:45:40.770 --> 01:45:41.510]  That's a good point.
[01:45:41.730 --> 01:45:42.970]  I don't need to keep all of these.
[01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:44.050]  I don't need to keep the Dirk.
[01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.710]  I keep all...
[01:45:46.710 --> 01:45:48.910]  You got to separate all parallels and special cards.
[01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:50.150]  Oh, I didn't think about that.
[01:45:50.370 --> 01:45:50.530]  Yeah.
[01:45:50.950 --> 01:45:51.690]  Don't worry. It's just...
[01:45:51.690 --> 01:45:52.530]  It's going to go...
[01:45:52.530 --> 01:45:53.490]  You're never going to see it again.
[01:45:53.550 --> 01:45:55.530]  It's going to go in these boxes and categorize.
[01:45:55.670 --> 01:45:57.470]  Oh, I'm not worried about ever seeing it again.
[01:45:57.930 --> 01:45:58.710]  I don't know if...
[01:45:58.710 --> 01:46:01.990]  I don't know if you thought that I was worried about seeing it again.
[01:46:02.490 --> 01:46:03.370]  Never a concern.
[01:46:03.710 --> 01:46:06.790]  Here we go with Kyle Korver.
[01:46:07.050 --> 01:46:07.450]  Oh.
[01:46:07.630 --> 01:46:08.450]  I was trying to use...
[01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:09.610]  I thought it said Kyle forever.
[01:46:12.410 --> 01:46:13.010]  Kyle Korver.
[01:46:13.330 --> 01:46:14.590]  Very good three-point shooter, that guy.
[01:46:14.610 --> 01:46:18.490]  I was going to say, what a shot of him laying up the basketball.
[01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:20.150]  Mark Jackson.
[01:46:20.410 --> 01:46:20.670]  All right.
[01:46:21.090 --> 01:46:22.230]  Is that the same...
[01:46:22.230 --> 01:46:23.590]  Mark Jackson, who used to coach?
[01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:25.090]  No, that's not the same Mark Jackson.
[01:46:26.530 --> 01:46:27.630]  Brandon Dawson, rookie.
[01:46:27.810 --> 01:46:28.510]  Green parallel.
[01:46:28.770 --> 01:46:29.270]  That's nice.
[01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.750]  Channing Frye.
[01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:33.930]  There's only like five cards in these?
[01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:34.430]  There's four.
[01:46:35.170 --> 01:46:36.710]  What the fuck?
[01:46:36.990 --> 01:46:37.690]  Four cards per pack.
[01:46:37.710 --> 01:46:39.230]  You spent $400 on...
[01:46:39.930 --> 01:46:40.650]  Do the math.
[01:46:40.810 --> 01:46:41.050]  Twenty-six cards or something.
[01:46:41.210 --> 01:46:41.690]  Thirty cards.
[01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:42.190]  Oh, my God.
[01:46:42.910 --> 01:46:44.610]  Not because I wanted to, but because we had to.
[01:46:45.750 --> 01:46:46.050]  What?
[01:46:46.050 --> 01:46:49.050]  Got to make content for the show, and I want to get some eye water.
[01:46:49.090 --> 01:46:52.210]  You went like, oh, man, we got like these Barbie ones that we can't open yet, but...
[01:46:52.550 --> 01:46:52.870]  What?
[01:46:53.050 --> 01:46:54.150]  Oh, I got plans for the Barbie cards.
[01:46:54.270 --> 01:46:55.410]  Emily has some cool plans for the Barbie cards.
[01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:56.330]  She's going to...
[01:46:56.850 --> 01:46:57.490]  Emily had this great idea.
[01:46:57.550 --> 01:46:58.710]  She's going to pull her Barbies out.
[01:46:59.130 --> 01:47:00.790]  I have another box as a home.
[01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:01.390]  We've opened them up.
[01:47:01.850 --> 01:47:04.390]  And she has a lot of those Barbies and a lot of those outfits.
[01:47:04.650 --> 01:47:08.270]  So what she's going to do is put together outfits, and then we'll put a Barbie up, and
[01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:09.970]  then we can chase that outfit in the cards.
[01:47:10.450 --> 01:47:11.590]  Oh, I actually like that idea.
[01:47:11.690 --> 01:47:12.430]  I like that idea a lot, too.
[01:47:12.490 --> 01:47:13.030]  I thought that was really cool.
[01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:13.890]  We should have done that with Shaq.
[01:47:13.930 --> 01:47:14.690]  Fucking Avery Bradley.
[01:47:14.850 --> 01:47:15.310]  Love him.
[01:47:15.330 --> 01:47:17.370]  We should have put different dresses on Shaq.
[01:47:18.650 --> 01:47:19.290]  Clay Thompson.
[01:47:19.730 --> 01:47:19.790]  Do it.
[01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.250]  Do it.
[01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:22.510]  Kevin Love.
[01:47:24.130 --> 01:47:24.870]  Oh, wow.
[01:47:24.990 --> 01:47:27.630]  I love the confidence in that keep.
[01:47:29.170 --> 01:47:32.070]  So this is the third-to-last pack.
[01:47:32.590 --> 01:47:33.270]  We're half...
[01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:34.130]  Yeah, we broke halfway.
[01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:36.650]  We have not gotten a Kane, then we've not...
[01:47:36.650 --> 01:47:38.370]  We've not gotten anywhere close to...
[01:47:38.370 --> 01:47:39.630]  Here's what we definitely haven't gotten.
[01:47:39.890 --> 01:47:42.770]  We haven't gotten anything close to Geoff recouping his investment.
[01:47:43.410 --> 01:47:45.450]  We've got another Tim Hardaway Jr. card.
[01:47:45.550 --> 01:47:45.710]  Cool.
[01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:46.810]  Pau Gasol.
[01:47:46.970 --> 01:47:47.350]  Awesome.
[01:47:48.250 --> 01:47:49.170]  Rudy Gobert.
[01:47:49.170 --> 01:47:49.790]  There you go.
[01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:50.810]  If you love defense.
[01:47:51.050 --> 01:47:52.030]  And, oh, there you go.
[01:47:52.090 --> 01:47:54.010]  LeBron James Firework insert.
[01:47:54.090 --> 01:47:54.730]  That's not bad.
[01:47:55.050 --> 01:47:55.870]  That's a pretty cool card.
[01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:57.270]  What is that, like, eight bucks?
[01:47:57.630 --> 01:48:00.390]  Oh, dude, I bet this is worth significantly more than that.
[01:48:00.470 --> 01:48:01.230]  No, really?
[01:48:01.390 --> 01:48:02.950]  Why don't you look up the LeBron James...
[01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:03.950]  It's number nine.
[01:48:04.730 --> 01:48:07.610]  LeBron James Fireworks prism.
[01:48:08.930 --> 01:48:09.810]  Probably get it for you.
[01:48:12.270 --> 01:48:13.690]  These are different fireworks.
[01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:16.290]  He has a lot of fireworks cards.
[01:48:16.850 --> 01:48:18.130]  This is a significant amount.
[01:48:18.130 --> 01:48:19.470]  Guy likes his fireworks.
[01:48:19.670 --> 01:48:19.910]  Yeah.
[01:48:20.330 --> 01:48:21.190]  Oh, is it?
[01:48:21.330 --> 01:48:22.170]  Yeah, that one?
[01:48:22.530 --> 01:48:25.310]  $74.99 on eBay right now.
[01:48:25.390 --> 01:48:25.790]  So there you go.
[01:48:25.890 --> 01:48:26.050]  $75.
[01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:26.530]  Whoa!
[01:48:27.110 --> 01:48:27.850]  So that's not a bad pull.
[01:48:28.650 --> 01:48:29.530]  Paul Pierce.
[01:48:29.710 --> 01:48:30.230]  Jesus Christ.
[01:48:30.230 --> 01:48:30.810]  The Truth.
[01:48:31.570 --> 01:48:32.510]  This man right here.
[01:48:33.330 --> 01:48:34.090]  Celtics legend.
[01:48:34.770 --> 01:48:37.190]  PSA rated $580.
[01:48:37.790 --> 01:48:39.110]  Yeah, LeBron James cards don't fuck around.
[01:48:39.670 --> 01:48:44.030]  LeBron James is the only athlete who his cards maintain value, whether they're rookie cards or not.
[01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:45.650]  Don't do that.
[01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:47.670]  Paul Pierce.
[01:48:47.770 --> 01:48:49.190]  Anyway, great story about Paul Pierce.
[01:48:49.970 --> 01:48:54.830]  Just got fired from ESPN for smoking weed and gambling on Instagram.
[01:48:55.630 --> 01:48:58.390]  But better story, shit his pants.
[01:48:59.530 --> 01:49:00.850]  Shit his pants in a game.
[01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:04.210]  Hit it by saying he hurt himself.
[01:49:04.370 --> 01:49:06.610]  They wheeled him out in a wheelchair.
[01:49:06.850 --> 01:49:10.490]  He was like, I have like a Charlie horse or something.
[01:49:10.690 --> 01:49:12.470]  He was like, oh, I need Gatorade.
[01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:16.790]  Everybody suspected he shit his pants the whole time because they wheeled him out in a wheelchair in the middle of the game.
[01:49:16.930 --> 01:49:19.210]  And then he came back 10 minutes later with different shorts on and was fine.
[01:49:19.970 --> 01:49:22.710]  Finally, like 10 years after, he finally admitted it.
[01:49:22.770 --> 01:49:23.350]  Yes, he shit his pants.
[01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:28.390]  And the fans immediately knew, spreading one of the most obscure yet hilarious conspiracy theories in the NBA,
[01:49:28.810 --> 01:49:32.450]  that Paul Pierce faked the injury to cover up shitting his pants.
[01:49:32.930 --> 01:49:34.110]  You can see a little bit of the poop.
[01:49:34.270 --> 01:49:35.310]  You got fired for gambling?
[01:49:35.890 --> 01:49:37.290]  Well, it was like on Instagram.
[01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:41.250]  It was gambling and smoking weed, which is legal where he is in California.
[01:49:41.250 --> 01:49:43.470]  And there were a lot of strippers and stuff.
[01:49:43.710 --> 01:49:45.650]  He was having like some kind of a crazy house party.
[01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:47.150]  And I guess they just...
[01:49:47.150 --> 01:49:49.130]  I think it's just one of those code of conduct things.
[01:49:49.150 --> 01:49:50.050]  They're just a little stuck up.
[01:49:51.010 --> 01:49:51.730]  Anthony Davis.
[01:49:52.150 --> 01:49:52.470]  They're owned by Disney, right?
[01:49:53.370 --> 01:49:53.730]  Yeah.
[01:49:54.710 --> 01:49:56.970]  Hey, we're Warner, baby. We can do anything.
[01:49:57.190 --> 01:49:57.470]  Woo!
[01:49:58.510 --> 01:49:59.730]  Carmelo, Anthony fireworks.
[01:49:59.890 --> 01:50:01.910]  I bet that's worth significantly less than the LeMans.
[01:50:03.070 --> 01:50:03.790]  Evan Turner.
[01:50:04.010 --> 01:50:04.830]  You kept it anyway.
[01:50:05.630 --> 01:50:06.370]  Well, I like Mello.
[01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:07.370]  Part of the banana boat, though.
[01:50:07.730 --> 01:50:08.910]  He's part of the team banana boat.
[01:50:09.310 --> 01:50:09.770]  Team banana boat.
[01:50:09.770 --> 01:50:11.050]  Significant hum.
[01:50:11.630 --> 01:50:13.670]  Is that coming from your bathroom?
[01:50:14.370 --> 01:50:14.890]  Oh, shit.
[01:50:14.930 --> 01:50:15.430]  Not me.
[01:50:18.090 --> 01:50:19.350]  What is that?
[01:50:19.370 --> 01:50:19.930]  What is that?
[01:50:22.010 --> 01:50:23.050]  That's awesome.
[01:50:23.230 --> 01:50:24.830]  Does that mean the Cayman White Walker is close?
[01:50:24.990 --> 01:50:25.190]  Yeah.
[01:50:25.330 --> 01:50:25.930]  Is it causing interference?
[01:50:26.550 --> 01:50:27.190]  All right, this is it.
[01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:33.650]  This is last chance at me getting a $1 card that I was chasing out of $400 worth of cards.
[01:50:33.790 --> 01:50:34.830]  $3 for the car.
[01:50:34.830 --> 01:50:35.690]  Dwight Howard.
[01:50:36.570 --> 01:50:37.830]  What is that?
[01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:40.050]  Dwight Howard used to call him Superman.
[01:50:42.010 --> 01:50:44.330]  I just asked and Nicholas went...
[01:50:44.330 --> 01:50:45.530]  Oh, you did it.
[01:50:45.710 --> 01:50:46.050]  There you go.
[01:50:46.290 --> 01:50:47.030]  I think it was the soundboard.
[01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.990]  Clay...
[01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.330]  Was it?
[01:50:48.570 --> 01:50:49.430]  Well, now it doesn't work.
[01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.970]  Oh, yep.
[01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:51.950]  Clay Thompson, USA basketball.
[01:50:52.590 --> 01:50:53.810]  Russell Westbrook fireworks.
[01:50:53.810 --> 01:50:54.150]  All right, here we go.
[01:50:54.230 --> 01:50:55.270]  And he got his card.
[01:50:55.390 --> 01:50:55.670]  Boom!
[01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:56.570]  Dirk Nowitzki.
[01:50:57.650 --> 01:50:58.490]  Where's your...
[01:50:59.190 --> 01:50:59.910]  Where's your card?
[01:50:59.950 --> 01:51:02.190]  Still holding out for the Cayman White Walker card.
[01:51:03.210 --> 01:51:04.730]  But you can sell this.
[01:51:05.050 --> 01:51:06.390]  Yeah, I'll sell the LeBron.
[01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:08.330]  I mean, no one will buy it, but you can sell it.
[01:51:08.410 --> 01:51:11.190]  And then, yeah, good for you.
[01:51:11.670 --> 01:51:12.950]  Get a PSA graded or whatever.
[01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:14.470]  I can afford a pack and a half with this.
[01:51:15.370 --> 01:51:15.930]  There you go.
[01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.630]  Way to go, man.
[01:51:17.930 --> 01:51:19.450]  You didn't even put it in a little thing.
[01:51:20.230 --> 01:51:22.350]  So we only have like a minute or so left.
[01:51:22.590 --> 01:51:24.810]  Andrew, is there anything you want to do to close this out?
[01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.670]  Before...
[01:51:25.670 --> 01:51:27.150]  Oh, shit, we got the grease cards?
[01:51:27.790 --> 01:51:28.930]  Before we do the...
[01:51:28.930 --> 01:51:29.990]  Get that Rizzo.
[01:51:31.390 --> 01:51:32.390]  Dude, if I get that Rizzo...
[01:51:32.910 --> 01:51:34.590]  I have to run with that and beat off real fast, right?
[01:51:34.610 --> 01:51:35.430]  Reclaim the boner.
[01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:36.890]  What the fuck?
[01:51:37.130 --> 01:51:38.290]  Here's the gum for you.
[01:51:38.730 --> 01:51:41.250]  No, it was just the first crush I ever had.
[01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:43.370]  Oh, I remember these.
[01:51:43.710 --> 01:51:44.530]  Look, I got a sticker.
[01:51:45.110 --> 01:51:46.090]  They're falling in love.
[01:51:46.230 --> 01:51:47.330]  Oh, that's so cute.
[01:51:48.350 --> 01:51:49.430]  Oh, and there's...
[01:51:50.110 --> 01:51:52.110]  Is this what gum tasted like in the 70s?
[01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:55.710]  Well, this is a different Rizzo, but I definitely remember.
[01:51:55.710 --> 01:51:56.710]  That's not Boner Rizzo.
[01:51:56.810 --> 01:51:58.610]  But that's when she's being Sandy.
[01:51:59.790 --> 01:52:01.290]  Ooh, portrait of a greaser.
[01:52:02.830 --> 01:52:03.990]  It's the Battlefield F guy.
[01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:05.790]  It is the Battlefield Earth guy.
[01:52:05.950 --> 01:52:07.850]  It is the Battlefield Earth guy.
[01:52:08.190 --> 01:52:09.150]  This is his rookie card.
[01:52:11.410 --> 01:52:13.050]  Some encouragement from Sandy.
[01:52:13.710 --> 01:52:15.790]  Oh, the T-Birds celebrate summer.
[01:52:16.190 --> 01:52:17.790]  Oh my god, what happened to him?
[01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:21.890]  He wanted to know if he got very far.
[01:52:22.370 --> 01:52:22.550]  Yeah.
[01:52:23.970 --> 01:52:25.270]  He said, tell me more.
[01:52:26.050 --> 01:52:27.330]  There's the Thunderbirds.
[01:52:28.030 --> 01:52:29.990]  Remember back in high school when you used to dance all the time?
[01:52:30.010 --> 01:52:31.130]  And everyone was 41?
[01:52:31.490 --> 01:52:31.770]  Coordinated, yeah.
[01:52:32.210 --> 01:52:33.570]  Here's the grease gang.
[01:52:35.330 --> 01:52:36.530]  That gum tastes terrible.
[01:52:36.910 --> 01:52:38.570]  Sandy and Danny, a happy ending.
[01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:43.410]  Well, it was a happy ending for Sandy and Danny, but it wasn't necessarily a happy ending for me because I didn't get the Cayman White Walker.
[01:52:44.010 --> 01:52:45.870]  And unfortunately, I didn't get the right Rizzo.
[01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:46.650]  But that's okay.
[01:52:46.890 --> 01:52:47.810]  There's always next time.
[01:52:48.570 --> 01:52:51.070]  Well, this was a successful...
[01:52:51.070 --> 01:52:52.330]  I'll put this Rizzo over there.
[01:52:53.930 --> 01:52:54.970]  Face breaks chat.
[01:52:54.990 --> 01:52:55.570]  I don't have the soundboard.
[01:52:55.610 --> 01:52:56.370]  No, no.
[01:52:56.830 --> 01:52:57.150]  Okay.
[01:52:57.370 --> 01:52:58.950]  No, no, no.
[01:52:59.110 --> 01:52:59.470]  Andrew.
[01:52:59.470 --> 01:53:01.830]  Andrew, how did you feel about this episode?
[01:53:02.610 --> 01:53:03.610]  I thought it was a great episode.
[01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:03.990]  Great.
[01:53:04.190 --> 01:53:07.290]  I thought the Barney Bularama was clearly the peak of the show.
[01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:10.790]  And the Pogs really carried it the rest of the way.
[01:53:11.590 --> 01:53:12.510]  What about all of...
[01:53:12.510 --> 01:53:14.470]  What about Geoff's...
[01:53:16.490 --> 01:53:18.510]  I mean, assortment of pulls here.
[01:53:19.410 --> 01:53:24.250]  You feel like you brought the goods and Geoff sort of, you know, was filling time or what?
[01:53:24.630 --> 01:53:26.550]  Oh, yeah, as per usual, I feel I carried the show.
[01:53:26.710 --> 01:53:28.150]  Look at all these pulls I got.
[01:53:28.150 --> 01:53:29.370]  Look at all these rad dudes.
[01:53:29.490 --> 01:53:30.150]  I got Grease.
[01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:31.570]  I got Hockey.
[01:53:31.610 --> 01:53:32.350]  I got Gagney's.
[01:53:32.430 --> 01:53:34.330]  I got Vanilla Ice.
[01:53:34.610 --> 01:53:35.350]  We got a whole...
[01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:36.570]  We got a dense collection.
[01:53:36.930 --> 01:53:36.990]  Yeah.
[01:53:37.150 --> 01:53:39.970]  We have a dense, dense collection at this point.
[01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.650]  Dense, dense.
[01:53:40.850 --> 01:53:41.490]  Yep, dense, dense.
[01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:49.150]  Andrew, as we are counting down the minutes that we have left here, is there anything you want to do to take us out?
[01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:51.490]  Yeah, I feel like I should get rid of this fresher.
[01:53:51.650 --> 01:53:51.850]  Okay.
[01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:52.790]  It smells horrendous.
[01:53:53.210 --> 01:53:53.590]  I need...
[01:53:53.590 --> 01:53:56.210]  My candle went out when I was trying to move it, so I'm going to light another match.
[01:53:56.290 --> 01:53:56.430]  Good.
[01:53:57.070 --> 01:53:58.210]  I'd be surprised if it does.
[01:53:58.310 --> 01:54:02.550]  I'm blown away he was able to light the candle after he spit a bunch of soda into it last time.
[01:54:04.410 --> 01:54:05.350]  Multiple candles, Gavin.
[01:54:05.630 --> 01:54:06.490]  Oh, it's a different candle?
[01:54:06.650 --> 01:54:07.050]  Oh, sorry.
[01:54:07.190 --> 01:54:08.010]  He's a candle guy.
[01:54:08.250 --> 01:54:08.910]  He's got candles.
[01:54:08.970 --> 01:54:12.730]  You can do a live soda drink right now, Geoff, and prove to everyone that you actually did it.
[01:54:12.850 --> 01:54:13.610]  That's true.
[01:54:13.990 --> 01:54:14.810]  You know what I've learned?
[01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:16.970]  I need to draw a couple of candles in the diagram.
[01:54:17.190 --> 01:54:17.810]  I'm sick of...
[01:54:17.810 --> 01:54:21.530]  I'm sick of doing these fucking soda challenges.
[01:54:21.810 --> 01:54:23.030]  I'm not telling you you have to.
[01:54:23.130 --> 01:54:23.990]  Do you want me to quickly get you one?
[01:54:24.290 --> 01:54:24.570]  Oh, no.
[01:54:24.630 --> 01:54:25.430]  He has one right here.
[01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:25.690]  Oh, yeah.
[01:54:25.770 --> 01:54:26.070]  Go for it.
[01:54:26.130 --> 01:54:27.270]  There's no reason to go get one.
[01:54:27.530 --> 01:54:28.730]  But Andrew's gonna burn a candle.
[01:54:28.830 --> 01:54:30.070]  Yeah, but that takes time.
[01:54:30.390 --> 01:54:31.210]  Yeah, and we can't see him.
[01:54:31.370 --> 01:54:31.490]  Yeah.
[01:54:31.810 --> 01:54:32.310]  That's two things.
[01:54:33.790 --> 01:54:34.170]  I gotta go.
[01:54:34.350 --> 01:54:34.670]  I gotta go.
[01:54:34.810 --> 01:54:35.130]  I gotta go.
[01:54:35.230 --> 01:54:35.650]  I gotta go.
[01:54:35.810 --> 01:54:36.190]  I gotta go.
[01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:36.570]  I gotta go.
[01:54:36.570 --> 01:54:36.690]  I gotta go.
[01:54:38.370 --> 01:54:40.110]  Well, that might do it for Andrew.
[01:54:41.810 --> 01:54:44.430]  Geoff, are you going to take us out with a soda chug or are we going home?
[01:54:44.430 --> 01:54:44.930]  Let's see it.
[01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.810]  All right.
[01:54:46.010 --> 01:54:46.370]  All right.
[01:54:47.470 --> 01:54:48.290]  I'll start the timer.
[01:54:48.670 --> 01:54:48.930]  Okay, ready?
[01:54:49.110 --> 01:54:50.330]  So I have to hold 30 seconds?
[01:54:50.410 --> 01:54:50.590]  Yep.
[01:54:51.790 --> 01:54:52.970]  And it's okay that it's Diet Coke?
[01:54:54.290 --> 01:54:54.710]  All right.
[01:54:55.530 --> 01:54:55.930]  And...
[01:54:55.930 --> 01:54:56.070]  Go!
[01:54:57.130 --> 01:55:01.210]  So the goal here is that Geoff is going to drink the entire soda and then not burp for
[01:55:01.210 --> 01:55:02.090]  30 seconds.
[01:55:03.290 --> 01:55:05.550]  He said that he's done it a couple of times before.
[01:55:06.090 --> 01:55:06.490]  Okay.
[01:55:06.850 --> 01:55:08.830]  We've both started timers independently.
[01:55:09.310 --> 01:55:09.750]  That's good.
[01:55:09.890 --> 01:55:10.810]  You can hold that up to your camera.
[01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.510]  There you go.
[01:55:11.790 --> 01:55:13.990]  Remember, 30 seconds to not burp.
[01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:19.610]  I will say that Geoff is right when losing the burp is the hard part.
[01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:20.270]  That's not good.
[01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.630]  No.
[01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:21.830]  I've already lost it.
[01:55:22.330 --> 01:55:23.030]  You lost the burp?
[01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:24.370]  So you just feel it sloshing down?
[01:55:24.430 --> 01:55:24.950]  Oh, I heard something!
[01:55:25.110 --> 01:55:25.410]  I heard that!
[01:55:25.490 --> 01:55:26.050]  I heard something!
[01:55:26.050 --> 01:55:26.890]  You did a little one!
[01:55:26.890 --> 01:55:27.310]  I don't know what that was!
[01:55:27.550 --> 01:55:28.730]  I think it was a burp!
[01:55:29.190 --> 01:55:30.310]  That was uncontrollable.
[01:55:30.530 --> 01:55:31.690]  But I don't feel like I've burped yet.
[01:55:31.790 --> 01:55:33.430]  That was like in your neck that came through.
[01:55:34.250 --> 01:55:36.030]  I think it was just like some tubby...
[01:55:36.610 --> 01:55:40.710]  Oh, you were so close at 29!
[01:55:42.270 --> 01:55:43.070]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:55:43.370 --> 01:55:43.590]  Wow.
[01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:45.030]  So, um...
[01:55:48.430 --> 01:55:50.730]  When people ask, what is this?
[01:55:50.730 --> 01:55:52.550]  I'll just say, it's content.
[01:55:53.930 --> 01:55:54.810]  That's what it is.
[01:55:55.630 --> 01:55:56.510]  Geoff, you want to take us out?
[01:55:56.650 --> 01:55:57.150]  You want to do the outro?
[01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:58.270]  Hey!
[01:55:58.490 --> 01:55:59.310]  You've done it again!
[01:55:59.490 --> 01:56:00.490]  You've, uh...
[01:56:00.490 --> 01:56:01.730]  watched another...
[01:56:04.110 --> 01:56:05.330]  FaceBreak shit show.
[01:56:05.610 --> 01:56:05.650]  No!
[01:56:06.050 --> 01:56:06.870]  And, uh...
[01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:07.590]  But you did it!
[01:56:07.630 --> 01:56:07.930]  You did!
[01:56:08.010 --> 01:56:09.110]  You may not think so, but you did.
[01:56:09.590 --> 01:56:10.870]  Uh, thanks for tuning in.
[01:56:10.930 --> 01:56:12.230]  I hope you enjoyed it.
[01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:19.870]  If you would be so kind as to buy a couple thousand air fresheners, we can buy some more product.
[01:56:21.070 --> 01:56:25.730]  And tune in at RTX on July 11th for the...
[01:56:27.770 --> 01:56:37.730]  FaceBreak shit RTX stream, where we will open up some of this stuff, including, but not limited to, the very exciting Twin Peaks cards.
[01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:38.910]  Aw, I'm excited about that.
[01:56:38.970 --> 01:56:41.210]  Very excited about that. That's for Gavin and I.
[01:56:41.390 --> 01:56:46.730]  And then, also, we'll probably hit those Umbrella Academy cards, which I'm pretty excited about. I'm a big fan of that show.
[01:56:47.350 --> 01:56:47.710]  And then, uh...
[01:56:47.710 --> 01:56:48.310]  Somebody has to be.
[01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:53.010]  And we gotta get some more Game of Thrones, which we have right there as well. We're really digging those Game of Thrones cards.
[01:56:53.250 --> 01:56:53.770]  We did it!
[01:56:54.390 --> 01:56:55.370]  Alright, that's it. It's over.
[01:56:55.490 --> 01:56:55.670]  Alright.
[01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.370]  Go away.
[01:56:56.510 --> 01:56:57.990]  You play the song now and we can go.
[01:56:58.050 --> 01:56:58.190]  Bye.
[01:56:58.870 --> 01:56:59.050]  Bye!
[01:57:00.150 --> 01:57:00.690]  It worked.
