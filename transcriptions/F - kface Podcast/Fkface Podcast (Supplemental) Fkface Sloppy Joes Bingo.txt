[00:00.000 --> 00:01.240]  You ever wonder why we're here?
[00:06.020 --> 00:08.280]  It's one of life's great mysteries, isn't it?
[00:18.710 --> 00:21.010]  Hello and welcome to...
[00:21.010 --> 00:21.330]  Hey, Jesus.
[00:21.910 --> 00:24.230]  What... what is that about?
[00:24.870 --> 00:26.130]  I had my volume up. Keep going.
[00:26.930 --> 00:32.030]  Hello and welcome to the first ever official...
[00:32.030 --> 00:35.730]  I've been beta testing this every Saturday night...
[00:35.730 --> 00:37.510]  Friday and Saturday night for like the last two months.
[00:37.510 --> 00:41.050]  Welcome to the first official Sloppy Joe's bingo...
[00:41.050 --> 00:42.250]  F*** face test.
[00:42.770 --> 00:44.790]  Because this isn't what the final form will be.
[00:45.090 --> 00:49.230]  But this is us. We're gonna watch the Sloppy Joe's livestream.
[00:49.570 --> 00:53.970]  If you don't know what this is, this is a bar in Key West called Sloppy Joe's.
[00:54.150 --> 00:55.290]  Famous for two things.
[00:55.430 --> 00:56.950]  One, Ernest Hemingway liked it a lot.
[00:57.070 --> 01:02.570]  And two, they proclaim, they purport to have invented the Sloppy Joe.
[01:02.570 --> 01:07.930]  Although there's another restaurant somewhere in the Midwest that also says they did it.
[01:08.410 --> 01:13.910]  What we're gonna do, I have been creating bingo prompts for the last couple of months.
[01:13.970 --> 01:16.790]  And I have narrowed it down to the absolute best of the prompts.
[01:17.150 --> 01:19.530]  And I've given everybody random bingo cards.
[01:19.610 --> 01:22.210]  In the middle, you'll see the f*** space. You can go ahead and mark that off.
[01:22.650 --> 01:24.990]  That is your free space for bingo.
[01:27.510 --> 01:30.230]  And also go ahead and look at your bingo prompts.
[01:30.230 --> 01:34.770]  Now, there are about 55 of them, so not everybody's gonna get every prompt.
[01:34.930 --> 01:37.230]  We'll probably have different ones.
[01:37.730 --> 01:44.170]  But if there's any confusion, if anybody doesn't understand what I've written down, ask me now.
[01:44.330 --> 01:48.730]  I mean, we can cover it in a moment, but ask me now, and I'd be happy to explain.
[01:49.350 --> 01:53.050]  We've not started yet, because I'm looking at a pretty dumb hat right now, and I'm not getting the credit for it.
[01:53.070 --> 01:54.410]  No, no, we haven't started yet.
[01:55.010 --> 01:57.810]  We have not started. We need to be really clear that this doesn't...
[01:57.810 --> 02:00.450]  Man, you're right. That would definitely check that f***ing box.
[02:00.470 --> 02:04.650]  Oh, that's a 100% dumb hat, yeah. And if he's still there by the time I'm done talking, he's yours.
[02:04.870 --> 02:12.510]  But like, for instance, I have guy on guy's scooter on mine. If you don't know what that means, it's two dudes riding on a scooter, and they don't want to touch.
[02:13.410 --> 02:17.250]  It happens all the time in Florida. Dudes don't like to touch dudes in Florida for some reason.
[02:17.830 --> 02:20.850]  A dead parrot head. That seemed to confuse a lot of the people in the audience.
[02:21.390 --> 02:25.750]  If you don't know what a parrot head is, it's a person who's way too into Jimmy Buffett.
[02:25.750 --> 02:30.250]  This is like Disneyland for Jimmy Buffett fans, Key West.
[02:30.490 --> 02:39.950]  And so what happens is a bunch of f***ing scuzzy dudes try to retire early to Key West, and they end up blowing through all their money in margaritas.
[02:40.370 --> 02:44.550]  And then they walk around like zombies. You'll recognize them. I'll point them out.
[02:44.630 --> 02:47.770]  If you have a question, is that a dead parrot head, I'll tell you yes or no.
[02:49.930 --> 02:54.270]  Can I ask, crosswalk coward, is that someone who's about to go and then they stop?
[02:54.270 --> 02:59.230]  Yeah, it happens a lot. Which also, every once in a while, a thing can be two things, right?
[02:59.330 --> 03:04.590]  Like, separated at the crosswalk can also be a crosswalk coward if one person goes and the other person doesn't.
[03:04.590 --> 03:06.730]  That's great. I have both of those and they're right next to each other.
[03:06.850 --> 03:12.290]  We all have our own bingo cards that Geoff has made for us.
[03:12.450 --> 03:19.810]  And what will be happening is we'll post these so you guys can follow along with our bingo cards and this Sloppy Joe stream.
[03:20.970 --> 03:22.370]  Geoff, what's a double fisting?
[03:23.150 --> 03:28.990]  Double fisting is when somebody walks around with two beers or two mixed drinks or whatever, they have one in each hand.
[03:29.170 --> 03:35.750]  It happens a lot. I've pretty much whittled it down to, there's only a few rarities that are going to be on the board.
[03:36.510 --> 03:44.610]  I'll also mention we're doing this, it's 9.07pm Central Time, which means it's 10.07pm on a Thursday night in Key West.
[03:44.750 --> 03:47.970]  Thursday's a good night. The best nights are obviously Friday and Saturday.
[03:47.970 --> 03:55.350]  We have determined that Slop O'Clock, that is the moment when things are out of control and they're at their wildest.
[03:55.690 --> 04:01.750]  Slop O'Clock is 11.15pm for Key West people. It's very specific.
[04:02.150 --> 04:09.710]  I imagine we'll win before then, but you never know. I figure we do one round, unless it's over in five minutes and then we can do a couple more.
[04:09.870 --> 04:11.290]  I do have extra bingo cards.
[04:11.730 --> 04:12.990]  Yeah, I do have another question, Geoff.
[04:13.070 --> 04:13.750]  Okay, okay.
[04:13.750 --> 04:19.730]  What is the ghost tour bus street train? Is that a specific one or is there a variety of them?
[04:19.970 --> 04:20.990]  You'll know that when you see it.
[04:21.250 --> 04:32.670]  There's a slash. It's ghost tour bus, which you will see, or street train, which is like a little choo-choo train that drives around and picks people up and drops them off.
[04:32.950 --> 04:36.570]  I'm going to be honest, that wasn't a real question. I just wanted the hat guy to get fully out of frame.
[04:37.050 --> 04:39.170]  Oh, you son of a bitch.
[04:39.430 --> 04:41.370]  Dumb hat left and also tricycle left.
[04:42.870 --> 04:56.590]  Okay, so we're going to count down and then if you're listening to this, this has to be difficult, but if you're watching this, you will see what we're seeing right there.
[04:57.150 --> 05:00.630]  So, Geoff, you want to count us down and that is when we will officially begin.
[05:01.070 --> 05:02.590]  Alright, I'm going to count us down from 300.
[05:03.270 --> 05:03.670]  What?
[05:04.230 --> 05:05.150]  Just kidding.
[05:06.530 --> 05:10.750]  5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[05:11.370 --> 05:14.390]  Sloppy Joe bingo, bitches. Let's go.
[05:14.870 --> 05:18.330]  Alright, so are we doing full card or are we doing just like a one line?
[05:18.330 --> 05:19.630]  No, no, we're just going to do just a bingo.
[05:20.090 --> 05:20.830]  Got it. One line.
[05:20.990 --> 05:22.770]  Just five in any row.
[05:23.430 --> 05:25.190]  Wait, what's Meemaw?
[05:26.030 --> 05:30.310]  Meemaw, it's a great question. It's a very old lady who has no business being out this late.
[05:30.570 --> 05:31.670]  I'll point her out.
[05:31.670 --> 05:34.630]  When you look at her and you're like, Granny, what are you doing out at midnight?
[05:34.810 --> 05:36.070]  Like that kind of thing, you'll see her.
[05:37.150 --> 05:41.790]  And I will try to point out, I have these all ingrained in my brain because I've been doing this so much.
[05:42.010 --> 05:47.070]  So I'll try to point out any time I see one, whether it's on, because I don't know what your cards are or not.
[05:47.130 --> 05:47.390]  Right.
[05:48.570 --> 05:50.930]  So, and if anybody has any questions, you let me know.
[05:51.330 --> 05:52.050]  This is great.
[05:52.470 --> 06:01.210]  Like, you've been talking about this and seeing it in action with bingo cards in front of us is very, like, I'm kind of like thrilled that we're doing this.
[06:01.670 --> 06:04.930]  I'm both thrilled and overwhelmed because the cards are so vast.
[06:05.070 --> 06:05.510]  Dumb hat.
[06:06.230 --> 06:06.970]  Dumb hat.
[06:07.090 --> 06:07.710]  Dumb hat.
[06:07.950 --> 06:09.270]  Oh, son of a bitch.
[06:09.530 --> 06:10.150]  He's got like a...
[06:10.150 --> 06:11.310]  Is that a plastic top hat on?
[06:11.430 --> 06:12.110]  Yes, it is.
[06:12.110 --> 06:13.230]  Plastic top hat. That is a dumb hat.
[06:13.350 --> 06:15.270]  If anybody has dumb hat, you can go ahead and knock it off.
[06:15.290 --> 06:18.350]  That guy's been there for a while. Thanks for that cool hat.
[06:18.610 --> 06:19.770]  That's okay. I got a dumb hat, too.
[06:20.850 --> 06:23.990]  I do not have dumb hat, unfortunately.
[06:24.370 --> 06:25.110]  Come on.
[06:25.550 --> 06:28.610]  Oh, look, kid out too late. That kid should not be out this late.
[06:28.930 --> 06:30.610]  Oh, you're getting to bed. Jesus Christ.
[06:30.610 --> 06:32.290]  That's true. It's 10 p.m.
[06:32.590 --> 06:39.490]  The official cutoff, by the way, that we've been running with is anything after 9.30, that kid's got to go to bed.
[06:39.850 --> 06:41.230]  So 9.30 is the cutoff.
[06:41.250 --> 06:41.550]  Is that a cowboy hat? Yes or no?
[06:41.790 --> 06:42.850]  Is that a cowboy hat? Yes or no?
[06:43.210 --> 06:43.910]  Her hat? No.
[06:44.050 --> 06:45.090]  The lady in front? No.
[06:45.170 --> 06:46.070]  It's more like a fedora.
[06:47.050 --> 06:47.630]  Do I have kid out late?
[06:47.630 --> 06:48.490]  I just got excited.
[06:50.510 --> 06:53.170]  Look at those crocs, dude.
[06:55.750 --> 06:58.810]  One of the grossest ones you'll get is barefoot.
[06:59.910 --> 07:00.250]  Yeah.
[07:01.210 --> 07:03.450]  I've also got jeans and flip-flops.
[07:05.250 --> 07:09.090]  It's got to have jeans on with flip-flops on. It's a very specific thing.
[07:09.470 --> 07:11.010]  Oh, is that a mullet? Is that a mullet?
[07:11.490 --> 07:12.330]  Yeah, that's a mullet.
[07:14.690 --> 07:17.450]  Thanks, dude, in the white shirt. Got me a nice mullet.
[07:17.870 --> 07:19.010]  That's a really good one, man.
[07:19.210 --> 07:21.230]  I will say mullet's one of the rarer ones.
[07:21.310 --> 07:25.650]  When I put it on there, I thought I'd see them all the time, but they don't happen as often as you'd think.
[07:25.650 --> 07:30.570]  Wow, it gets really crowded right here, and then I have a feeling it starts getting really uncrowded right here.
[07:31.890 --> 07:32.530]  Damn shorts.
[07:32.790 --> 07:34.770]  Yeah, it starts to slow down at like 12.30.
[07:35.130 --> 07:35.410]  Yeah.
[07:35.970 --> 07:39.510]  You see that lady right there? Now, is that a bachelorette outfit? I can't...
[07:39.930 --> 07:40.490]  Couldn't tell.
[07:40.730 --> 07:42.330]  I couldn't tell, so I can't mark it off.
[07:43.870 --> 07:44.190]  Goddamn.
[07:45.450 --> 07:49.170]  So, you're going to want to keep... for cars, you're going to want to keep your eye out for a luxury car.
[07:49.310 --> 07:52.990]  You're going to want to keep your eye out for the pink taxi, the ghost tour bus.
[07:53.050 --> 07:55.410]  You're going to want to look for a tricycle and a go-kart.
[07:55.410 --> 07:59.470]  And when I say go-kart, I mean an absolute fucking go-kart.
[07:59.910 --> 08:00.270]  Yeah.
[08:01.370 --> 08:03.150]  Oh, what's this? Is the tricycle coming up?
[08:05.130 --> 08:08.810]  Anything with three wheels is a tricycle. That's a luxury car right there. That's definitely a luxury car.
[08:08.830 --> 08:10.910]  A luxury car and a tricycle in the same frame.
[08:11.130 --> 08:11.970]  Oh, shit.
[08:12.950 --> 08:15.410]  How many pieces have you got now, Gavin? I feel like you've got a lot.
[08:15.750 --> 08:17.490]  I've got five now. Oh, I've got four.
[08:17.890 --> 08:18.950]  Because of the free space.
[08:19.070 --> 08:19.370]  Jesus.
[08:20.090 --> 08:23.930]  See, this is what I was talking about where it, like, everyone's gone, jeans and flip flops!
[08:24.010 --> 08:25.010]  Is that jeans? Is that jeans?
[08:25.010 --> 08:25.790]  Flip flops! Flip flops!
[08:26.030 --> 08:27.450]  That's jeans and flip flops! Yeah, that counts.
[08:27.890 --> 08:28.970]  Yes! Yes!
[08:30.790 --> 08:33.530]  God, I'm getting crucified. I've only got two... I've only got one thing left.
[08:33.550 --> 08:35.830]  Dude, me too. I've got the free space and jeans and flip flops.
[08:36.590 --> 08:38.370]  I just got fucking tricycle.
[08:38.850 --> 08:44.650]  It's too early for a... well, it's never too early for a drunk walk, but they become a lot more prevalent in about an hour.
[08:45.070 --> 08:47.230]  I got my fingers crossed for a wheelchair at this point.
[08:49.290 --> 08:52.230]  Life is too short, boss. I've never seen that before.
[08:52.230 --> 08:55.270]  What is camera shy? Is that, like, noticing the camera and being like, oh no.
[08:55.650 --> 09:01.130]  Yeah, some people will notice the camera and then jump and wave and stuff. Other people will see it and try to duck out of the way.
[09:01.350 --> 09:02.030]  Now the tricycle.
[09:02.530 --> 09:03.550]  Yeah, there's another tricycle.
[09:03.790 --> 09:08.450]  Is bandage dude... intensely bandaged? Or is that just slightly...
[09:08.450 --> 09:14.030]  Anybody in a cast or a fucking, like, a leg brace or whatever, you'll see it.
[09:14.530 --> 09:17.590]  Oh shit, I've got nighttime shades. I haven't even been looking for that.
[09:18.190 --> 09:18.290]  Oh!
[09:18.890 --> 09:19.330]  I have it too.
[09:19.890 --> 09:21.050]  I would have pointed him out.
[09:21.850 --> 09:28.450]  See, this is like, doing this for the first time and having to keep track of what you have and what's on the screen is so hard.
[09:28.570 --> 09:32.010]  But man, this is way better than going like, I-18.
[09:33.430 --> 09:38.890]  I'm lucky here because I've got dropped spilled food and drink and I've also got dropped something.
[09:39.050 --> 09:39.870]  So that's a double whammy.
[09:40.470 --> 09:40.630]  Me too.
[09:41.170 --> 09:41.990]  If it's food, yeah.
[09:43.210 --> 09:45.250]  Oh, watch this. This lady's gonna get in a car. Is it your car?
[09:45.570 --> 09:46.610]  Is that pickup?
[09:46.910 --> 09:48.310]  That's a pickup drop-off.
[09:48.310 --> 09:49.690]  That's a car delivery pickup.
[09:50.030 --> 09:51.150]  I'm one away from a bingo!
[09:52.010 --> 09:53.530]  You're one away from a bingo?!
[09:53.530 --> 09:55.110]  I'm one away from a bingo!
[09:55.230 --> 09:55.710]  No way!
[09:56.530 --> 09:57.930]  I'm looking for a double fisting.
[09:58.190 --> 09:59.570]  I got my eyes open for a double fisting.
[09:59.570 --> 10:00.310]  I need that too.
[10:01.110 --> 10:05.590]  If we get it too fast, we can try to blank out the card or just go for another round of bingo.
[10:05.870 --> 10:10.250]  If we get it already, we should definitely go for, like, the blanked out card.
[10:10.610 --> 10:11.130]  Okay, okay.
[10:11.770 --> 10:14.370]  That can be a little bit rough, but we'll try it.
[10:14.670 --> 10:15.190]  We gotta try.
[10:15.790 --> 10:17.890]  But some of you guys are already killing it.
[10:17.890 --> 10:19.950]  I have, Geoff, I just have two.
[10:20.670 --> 10:21.570]  I just have two.
[10:21.570 --> 10:22.790]  Oh, wait, fuck!
[10:23.290 --> 10:23.690]  Fuck!
[10:24.110 --> 10:24.290]  What?
[10:24.430 --> 10:25.630]  No, I got tricked!
[10:26.050 --> 10:26.930]  I got deceived!
[10:27.430 --> 10:27.750]  What happened?
[10:27.750 --> 10:30.870]  My card, my card had an X on it that shouldn't be there.
[10:30.950 --> 10:34.010]  I have dancing already X'd when Geoff sent me the card.
[10:34.250 --> 10:35.490]  You X'd something already?
[10:35.730 --> 10:37.150]  No, Geoff X'd it, I think.
[10:37.630 --> 10:38.330]  Can I X it?
[10:38.410 --> 10:38.730]  I didn't X anything.
[10:39.130 --> 10:40.210]  Okay, then I X'd it.
[10:40.290 --> 10:40.690]  Then I'm an idiot.
[10:40.930 --> 10:41.970]  Fuck, I'm a dummy.
[10:42.310 --> 10:43.090]  God damn it.
[10:43.590 --> 10:44.250]  I'm two away.
[10:44.730 --> 10:45.970]  Was that some double fisting back there?
[10:46.030 --> 10:46.730]  Oh, I didn't really see.
[10:46.730 --> 10:49.510]  I was too busy looking at my dancing that I missed some fisting.
[10:49.610 --> 10:50.570]  Oh, there's a puppy.
[10:51.190 --> 10:53.650]  I used to have puppy on there, but I took it off.
[10:53.890 --> 10:55.270]  Man, this guy is pacing.
[10:55.590 --> 10:56.930]  I saw chili dog and got excited.
[10:57.150 --> 10:57.770]  That is not that.
[10:57.970 --> 11:05.990]  Dude, one of the best is, like, I guess the hot dog stand is right at the top right, right past where you can see.
[11:06.270 --> 11:10.870]  So when they walk down, they're just like, they've got like a half a hot dog in their mouth right under the camera.
[11:11.010 --> 11:11.630]  It's awesome.
[11:12.370 --> 11:13.930]  Oh, there's another kid in a stroller.
[11:14.450 --> 11:16.250]  Yeah, kid in a stroller, you're out too late!
[11:17.590 --> 11:18.630]  Put your kid to bed.
[11:18.890 --> 11:19.910]  Put the dog to bed.
[11:19.970 --> 11:21.470]  The dog doesn't want to be out here late.
[11:21.790 --> 11:22.770]  I hate that shit.
[11:22.950 --> 11:23.430]  Look at this guy.
[11:23.510 --> 11:24.190]  He's got sunglasses.
[11:24.570 --> 11:25.530]  If he just drops them.
[11:28.590 --> 11:29.350]  I'm that guy.
[11:29.710 --> 11:31.850]  There's a lot of sunglasses, none of them on.
[11:32.170 --> 11:33.810]  That guy looked like he had a wedgie for a little bit.
[11:33.970 --> 11:34.510]  He sure did.
[11:35.330 --> 11:37.810]  Well, if he would have picked it, that's one for me.
[11:38.270 --> 11:38.910]  Oh, really?
[11:39.410 --> 11:40.370]  So here's what I'm looking for.
[11:40.430 --> 11:44.570]  I'm looking for twerking, drop something, chug, aggressive honking, trip.
[11:44.570 --> 12:01.750]  Someone yells for someone to wait up, guy on guy scooter, drop, spilled food and drink, drunk walk, ghost tour bus, sitting on the street, nose pick, beach goth, matching outfits, go-kart yawning, double fisting, bachelorette party, trying to get in the wrong car, dead parent head in formal attire.
[12:02.430 --> 12:03.810]  Now, a twerk's a dance, right?
[12:04.010 --> 12:05.610]  Yeah, it's a specific dance.
[12:05.770 --> 12:08.810]  But if you have dancing and twerking and they twerk, then you can knock out both, obviously.
[12:08.810 --> 12:10.570]  That kid over there is dancing, but...
[12:11.130 --> 12:15.430]  Are the bouncers the guys in those bright pink shirts up there?
[12:15.630 --> 12:16.310]  Yeah, they say security.
[12:16.930 --> 12:24.510]  Bouncer bouncing is a little bit of a tough... like, two of the tougher ones to honestly get are sitting down and bouncer bouncing, but they do happen.
[12:24.830 --> 12:24.990]  Okay.
[12:27.170 --> 12:28.990]  I feel like we're about to get a crosswalk coward.
[12:29.790 --> 12:31.250]  Let's see. Keep your eyes open.
[12:33.750 --> 12:35.390]  I'm surprised no one got separated.
[12:37.430 --> 12:38.150]  Damn it!
[12:38.490 --> 12:39.270]  They went for it.
[12:39.270 --> 12:41.550]  They all went for it.
[12:42.290 --> 12:43.310]  I really felt it.
[12:43.890 --> 12:46.410]  How fast does someone have to be going to be hoofing it, Geoff?
[12:46.650 --> 12:48.250]  Oh, you'll see. I'll point it out.
[12:49.210 --> 12:52.930]  They gotta be... I mean, it's... I didn't say jog, and I said hoofing it.
[12:53.810 --> 12:54.170]  Okay.
[12:56.490 --> 12:57.390]  This is a great game.
[12:57.630 --> 12:58.310]  It just froze.
[12:58.730 --> 12:59.450]  The feed froze.
[12:59.470 --> 13:00.170]  Nick, did yours freeze?
[13:00.470 --> 13:01.270]  No, mine's still going.
[13:01.710 --> 13:06.790]  Okay. I'll refresh. I don't know how that happened. That was very weird. Sorry about that, guys. I don't know.
[13:06.870 --> 13:07.730]  Oh, no worries. No worries.
[13:07.730 --> 13:11.050]  Also, don't worry, because Nick has his stuff, too.
[13:11.670 --> 13:12.470]  Cool motorcycle.
[13:13.190 --> 13:13.230]  Yeah.
[13:13.290 --> 13:14.210]  That is a cool motorcycle.
[13:15.790 --> 13:20.210]  Sometimes you see the pink taxi, like, every three minutes, and then sometimes it takes an hour. I don't...
[13:20.610 --> 13:23.030]  I'm starting to wonder if there's only one pink taxi.
[13:23.230 --> 13:26.470]  Yeah, there's a scooter, but I need a guy on that scooter with that guy.
[13:26.870 --> 13:27.730]  Yeah, unfortunately...
[13:29.270 --> 13:30.350]  Oh, it's that kind of scooter.
[13:30.850 --> 13:35.090]  Yeah, he's riding solo, unfortunately, so...
[13:35.090 --> 13:36.030]  This rules.
[13:36.030 --> 13:38.110]  Come on, crosswalk coward!
[13:39.010 --> 13:39.750]  Get separated!
[13:42.590 --> 13:43.170]  Also...
[13:43.930 --> 13:52.430]  This isn't on the bingo card in any way, but an observation that I will point out to you guys to look out for...
[13:52.430 --> 13:59.970]  Every single person who rides a bicycle down Duval Street in Key West looks like they're riding one...
[13:59.970 --> 14:00.910]  That's a guy and a girl there.
[14:00.970 --> 14:01.310]  That's a guy and a girl.
[14:01.310 --> 14:04.430]  Looks like they're riding a bicycle for the second time.
[14:07.430 --> 14:08.230]  It is...
[14:08.230 --> 14:10.950]  The amount of people that have almost run into cars...
[14:10.950 --> 14:12.330]  Oh, is that a guy dancing?
[14:12.650 --> 14:13.410]  Is that a dancer?
[14:13.730 --> 14:15.730]  No, he was doing a lasso.
[14:16.150 --> 14:17.190]  Did a bit of a yee-haw.
[14:17.510 --> 14:18.370]  Come on, buddy, dance.
[14:19.010 --> 14:20.050]  You son of a bitch.
[14:22.590 --> 14:24.790]  Does anybody have an offensive t-shirt? That's a good one.
[14:25.310 --> 14:26.010]  Matching hats.
[14:26.790 --> 14:27.530]  I do, I have an offensive hat.
[14:27.530 --> 14:28.270]  Oh, is that matching?
[14:28.490 --> 14:28.770]  Nice.
[14:28.810 --> 14:30.170]  Is that a matching outfit? Matching hats?
[14:30.310 --> 14:30.630]  No.
[14:30.670 --> 14:30.990]  It's the same hat.
[14:31.750 --> 14:32.370]  It's an outfit!
[14:32.730 --> 14:35.310]  Unless it's like pointedly the same.
[14:36.550 --> 14:40.310]  I've seen some old guys who are dressed the same, but not together.
[14:41.010 --> 14:42.350]  Yeah, no, they gotta be together.
[14:42.950 --> 14:48.590]  There'll be a lot of people that are wearing the same shirt for somebody's bachelor party or something.
[14:49.310 --> 14:50.070]  That's pretty common.
[14:50.630 --> 14:52.830]  Come on, get fucked up at a crosswalk, come on.
[14:53.170 --> 14:54.130]  How about double fisting?
[14:54.990 --> 14:56.110]  I want some drinks.
[14:56.970 --> 14:59.030]  Everyone's being bloody responsible tonight.
[14:59.250 --> 14:59.510]  Yeah, boo.
[14:59.550 --> 15:02.890]  See this guy right here? He's drunk walking, right?
[15:03.350 --> 15:04.070]  Which guy?
[15:04.070 --> 15:06.130]  The guy that just walked across the screen.
[15:07.230 --> 15:07.950]  Guy on guy?
[15:08.250 --> 15:09.130]  Guy on guy scooter!
[15:09.610 --> 15:10.390]  Guy on guy scooter.
[15:11.870 --> 15:12.990]  I got that one.
[15:14.270 --> 15:15.690]  Sitting on this guy on guy scooter.
[15:16.210 --> 15:18.850]  And where was... I had drunk walk too, didn't I?
[15:19.450 --> 15:20.190]  Drunk walk, yeah.
[15:20.690 --> 15:24.930]  Alright, so if I get spilled drink and someone yells for somebody to wait up, I'm fucking set.
[15:27.230 --> 15:28.970]  I can't believe we haven't seen a handshake.
[15:29.130 --> 15:30.410]  I'm really looking for a handshake here.
[15:30.730 --> 15:31.290]  Oh, we got one.
[15:31.890 --> 15:33.130]  We had one earlier, did you miss it?
[15:33.130 --> 15:34.670]  Oh, I already missed it.
[15:34.930 --> 15:35.430]  Was there a handshake?
[15:36.030 --> 15:38.050]  Yeah, there was a 100% handshake like two minutes ago.
[15:38.790 --> 15:39.430]  God damn it.
[15:39.830 --> 15:41.850]  I'm not gonna mark it off, I wanna see it.
[15:42.190 --> 15:42.990]  Nick is harsh.
[15:43.590 --> 15:50.530]  I've realized as well, if someone drops their food and doesn't pick it up, I get dropped food, dropped something, and litterbug.
[15:50.910 --> 15:52.530]  I get litterbug too!
[15:52.830 --> 15:57.710]  Dude, I've had a couple of drunk dudes that have been like four things at once.
[15:58.550 --> 16:00.490]  Every once in a while you get lucky like that.
[16:01.590 --> 16:04.650]  It's like the sloppy Joe's golden snitch.
[16:04.770 --> 16:07.370]  Geoff, I wanna commend you again, this is great.
[16:07.390 --> 16:08.150]  This is phenomenal.
[16:08.430 --> 16:14.970]  This is so good, I'm having so much fun playing bingo watching drunk people.
[16:15.710 --> 16:17.050]  This is so fucking fun.
[16:17.050 --> 16:17.570]  Ooh, bachelorette party?
[16:18.170 --> 16:18.950]  Oh, hang on.
[16:19.190 --> 16:21.050]  Oh wait, they might have the same-
[16:21.050 --> 16:22.310]  That's a matching outfit!
[16:22.770 --> 16:24.890]  That is a matching outfit.
[16:26.810 --> 16:30.170]  I can't tell if they're bachelorette party or not.
[16:30.170 --> 16:31.090]  Drop something!
[16:31.630 --> 16:34.590]  She has the white in her hair, like the veil on the back.
[16:34.630 --> 16:35.090]  Oh, does she?
[16:35.370 --> 16:37.070]  Yeah, yeah, she does, that's bachelorette party, hell yeah.
[16:37.130 --> 16:37.550]  Bachelorette party.
[16:37.850 --> 16:38.330]  Veil counts.
[16:40.310 --> 16:42.450]  Drop food and aggressive honking, here we go, here we go.
[16:42.710 --> 16:43.590]  I just need a wheelchair.
[16:44.270 --> 16:45.430]  That's aggressive revving.
[16:45.970 --> 16:47.930]  If I get trip, I get it.
[16:49.850 --> 16:51.630]  None of these people dropping anything.
[16:52.070 --> 16:53.730]  I need formal attire and dancing.
[16:56.330 --> 16:57.550]  Loser boards, what are these?
[16:57.550 --> 17:02.630]  Oh shit, it's a skateboard, that counts as a skateboard, that's on the list.
[17:03.590 --> 17:04.750]  Did you call them loser boards?
[17:05.270 --> 17:10.430]  I thought it was like what I ride around on.
[17:14.130 --> 17:22.730]  Oh man, I'm glad to hear you're enjoying it because I've done this so much, it's fun to me, but only because I've been doing it twice a week at DPL.
[17:23.210 --> 17:23.550]  It's great.
[17:23.950 --> 17:24.510]  I love this.
[17:25.570 --> 17:30.730]  And by the way, I can't take all the credit for this, this is as much Emily's invention as mine, we worked on this together.
[17:31.010 --> 17:32.890]  Well thank you Emily, she did a great job too.
[17:33.310 --> 17:34.550]  She gets the accolades too.
[17:37.370 --> 17:43.430]  Now, to acknowledge the camera, do they have to like do a bit in front of it or just like look at it for a few seconds?
[17:43.570 --> 17:45.130]  They'll look at it, you'll see.
[17:45.530 --> 17:49.870]  If they recognize that they're being filmed and they don't run away and hide, then they're acknowledging it.
[17:51.550 --> 17:57.870]  I'll tell you, the hardest one, the one that causes the most fights in my household is formal attire.
[17:58.090 --> 17:59.290]  Oh man, I need that!
[18:00.250 --> 18:05.570]  I am far more liberal on formal attire than Emily is, she's a stickler about it.
[18:06.250 --> 18:08.010]  Man, I've totally slowed down, is that a luxury car?
[18:08.390 --> 18:09.730]  That is absolutely a luxury car.
[18:09.890 --> 18:11.410]  Yeah, definitely a luxury car.
[18:12.950 --> 18:15.030]  Drop the bag, drop the bag, drop the bag!
[18:16.350 --> 18:16.790]  What?
[18:17.450 --> 18:20.350]  These people have no idea that we're doing this.
[18:21.830 --> 18:23.610]  Are we gonna have to blur all these faces?
[18:25.090 --> 18:26.290]  We got it, we got it figured out.
[18:26.430 --> 18:27.870]  Look at that guy dancing!
[18:28.090 --> 18:29.170]  That was dancing here!
[18:29.430 --> 18:30.870]  That counted, that counted.
[18:31.050 --> 18:32.770]  That was a touchdown dance for sure.
[18:35.090 --> 18:37.250]  Geoff, all I need is formal wear.
[18:37.810 --> 18:38.710]  That's a tough one.
[18:39.530 --> 18:41.790]  Like for instance, this lady in the pink dress, that doesn't count.
[18:42.090 --> 18:42.370]  No!
[18:43.170 --> 18:43.810]  That's clothes.
[18:43.810 --> 18:47.470]  Oh, those girls in the back by the light pole are dancing their asses off, that's great.
[18:47.950 --> 18:49.270]  Look at how much fun they're having.
[18:51.170 --> 18:55.870]  If I get a guy in a wheelchair with two drinks, I'm fucking set.
[18:58.230 --> 19:00.450]  Don't be surprised if that shows up.
[19:01.810 --> 19:03.970]  Wheelchair comes up because it's pretty common.
[19:07.570 --> 19:11.610]  I can't believe no one's been separated at the crosswalk, and we haven't had any crosswalk cowards.
[19:11.690 --> 19:12.470]  It's killing me.
[19:12.830 --> 19:15.230]  I have those two spaces next to each other.
[19:16.490 --> 19:21.490]  It becomes way more prevalent later on, as does tripping.
[19:21.890 --> 19:23.410]  People fucking fall constantly.
[19:23.770 --> 19:26.330]  Went for it. Damn, no cowardice in that person.
[19:26.950 --> 19:28.850]  Do you ever see people roll out of those golf carts?
[19:29.650 --> 19:30.810]  No, I haven't seen that yet.
[19:32.170 --> 19:33.390]  I want to though.
[19:35.750 --> 19:39.370]  Gut check real quick, who only needs one and what is it?
[19:40.490 --> 19:44.370]  I need one in two ways, I need either a wheelchair or a double fist.
[19:44.370 --> 19:45.330]  Okay, so you need two.
[19:45.750 --> 19:49.350]  I have two different ways I can get a bingo.
[19:49.790 --> 19:53.450]  If I get trip, I've got it.
[19:55.150 --> 19:58.310]  I have quite a lot crossed out, but not in any useful pattern.
[20:00.030 --> 20:01.190]  Nick, how far are you?
[20:01.650 --> 20:05.490]  I need two. I need aggressive honking and dropped or spilled food and drink.
[20:06.430 --> 20:07.590]  Honking is a tough one.
[20:09.010 --> 20:12.390]  And by the way, I consider most honking to be aggressive honking.
[20:14.430 --> 20:15.730]  It's an aggressive act.
[20:16.050 --> 20:20.190]  I mean, especially in this area, it doesn't feel like there's going to be polite honking.
[20:21.430 --> 20:26.690]  The more I stare at this ground, the more I think barefoot is disgusting.
[20:27.350 --> 20:28.370]  Oh, it's brutal.
[20:29.350 --> 20:32.670]  I think Flip Flops is fucking pushing it here.
[20:34.130 --> 20:44.030]  Dude, we watched a dude lean up against the right wall, bend over, throw up, stand back up, pretend like he didn't do it, throw up again, then walk away.
[20:44.030 --> 20:45.750]  And then, that's a drop-off.
[20:45.930 --> 20:51.790]  Then we watched eight women walk through it in Flip Flops and had no idea they were standing in P.
[20:55.750 --> 21:03.650]  It is gross what goes on at 11pm in Key West.
[21:05.670 --> 21:06.550]  Truly vile.
[21:07.090 --> 21:09.230]  Is the goal to still be playing this at slop o'clock?
[21:10.190 --> 21:11.810]  No. I mean, if you want to.
[21:11.810 --> 21:16.990]  That's a nice thing about it. There are some nights when we'll go through five bingo cards in an hour.
[21:17.550 --> 21:22.010]  We're just on a Friday night when it's hopping. You can burn through it.
[21:22.350 --> 21:23.370]  That was the whitest turn.
[21:27.470 --> 21:31.530]  It is. I'm just locking into hands like I never have before.
[21:31.630 --> 21:35.790]  Also, the fact that nobody's dropped anything, I feel like is embarrassing for the NFL.
[21:36.130 --> 21:38.670]  They are making wide receivers look bad.
[21:39.270 --> 21:42.030]  These drunken people haven't dropped a single thing.
[21:42.030 --> 21:42.810]  She's acknowledged it!
[21:46.170 --> 21:48.210]  That's right, lady! Awesome.
[21:48.850 --> 21:51.250]  And that guy's got Flip Flops and jeans, but you guys already got that.
[21:51.890 --> 21:55.890]  Now, if I get dropped something in Pink Taxi, brother, I got it.
[21:57.090 --> 21:59.970]  I could also get Pink Taxi in Cop Car, Ambulance, or Fire Truck.
[22:01.410 --> 22:05.690]  Yo, this is so fun. This is so good. This rules.
[22:08.290 --> 22:10.030]  I can't believe we haven't got a selfie.
[22:12.450 --> 22:17.330]  Selfies are not super common. They definitely happen, but they're not as much as you would think.
[22:17.530 --> 22:18.370]  That guy's drunk.
[22:21.510 --> 22:23.770]  I gotta be honest, there's a lot of really nice neck cuts.
[22:23.790 --> 22:26.850]  Oh, that lady in the back is chugging it! She's chugging it over by the taxi! Did you see her?
[22:27.270 --> 22:29.370]  She chugged it with the blue culottes on.
[22:29.550 --> 22:31.010]  Dude, I got chugged.
[22:31.530 --> 22:33.530]  Oh, yeah, she fucking chugged the hell out of it.
[22:33.530 --> 22:34.490]  Oh, she's waving again.
[22:34.490 --> 22:35.290]  Goodbye.
[22:35.610 --> 22:38.030]  She doesn't know what the fuck she's doing. She didn't know she were here.
[22:40.210 --> 22:45.130]  Dude, sometimes they'll call their friend, and then they'll stand there and wave at their friend for an hour.
[22:45.210 --> 22:46.050]  Wait, move your head!
[22:46.590 --> 22:48.770]  Has he got two? No, those are keys. Fuck.
[22:50.350 --> 22:53.870]  If he tried to drink his keys because he was so drunk, I think that would count, though.
[22:54.910 --> 22:55.530]  She's back.
[22:55.990 --> 22:56.890]  Yeah, she's loving it.
[22:58.150 --> 23:00.610]  It's interesting to me... put your kid to bed!
[23:00.970 --> 23:02.490]  It's interesting to me...
[23:04.230 --> 23:08.770]  ...how novel a webcam is to some people.
[23:08.970 --> 23:10.630]  Because they can't see themselves, right?
[23:11.090 --> 23:11.370]  Yeah, no.
[23:12.550 --> 23:16.830]  And it's like 2023. You're on camera everywhere you go. That is formal wear.
[23:17.210 --> 23:18.210]  That's formal wear?
[23:18.390 --> 23:19.370]  That's formal wear.
[23:19.610 --> 23:21.210]  Don't you think so? A full-length gown?
[23:21.350 --> 23:23.150]  Hey, you know what? I do.
[23:23.710 --> 23:25.110]  And that's a Sloppy Joe's bingo.
[23:27.290 --> 23:30.950]  Matching outfits, formal wear, fuck, space, dancing, guy-on-guy scooter.
[23:31.630 --> 23:32.430]  That's incredible.
[23:32.550 --> 23:36.610]  That is a Sloppy Joe's bingo, ladies and gentlemen. Boom!
[23:37.250 --> 23:41.170]  Eric wins it. Now we can go for a second place, or we can try to fill the board.
[23:41.610 --> 23:42.710]  We have to keep going.
[23:43.930 --> 23:44.870]  Let's fill the board, then.
[23:45.030 --> 23:47.310]  This is a blast. I want to keep going.
[23:47.710 --> 23:48.490]  Yeah, this is great.
[23:48.790 --> 23:53.110]  I don't even care that I won. I want to keep doing this.
[23:53.350 --> 23:56.070]  It is almost a bummer when you win too fast.
[23:57.130 --> 23:59.010]  Why are these pink caps, for Christ's sake?
[24:00.430 --> 24:03.250]  They're a fucking conundrum.
[24:03.310 --> 24:04.350]  I don't understand.
[24:04.470 --> 24:06.450]  I'm looking at three different caps and none of them are pink.
[24:08.310 --> 24:10.570]  Imagine being a taxi driver here.
[24:11.970 --> 24:12.510]  Nightmare.
[24:12.930 --> 24:14.270]  Is that Mimo?
[24:14.490 --> 24:15.610]  No, she's too young.
[24:17.110 --> 24:18.010]  You'll see her.
[24:19.590 --> 24:20.870]  She's way too spry.
[24:21.910 --> 24:23.050]  Too young, not enough cigarettes.
[24:23.730 --> 24:34.830]  I think my favorite thing that I've encountered, and I didn't initially have it on the bingo, it's actually the most recent thing I've added, is people trying to get into the wrong Uber.
[24:35.010 --> 24:37.250]  Because it happens so fucking much.
[24:37.390 --> 24:38.970]  And it's so funny.
[24:39.530 --> 24:40.970]  Oh, Wavy McWaverson's back.
[24:42.270 --> 24:43.290]  He got his ID out.
[24:45.170 --> 24:46.470]  She's eyeing the camera again.
[24:46.510 --> 24:47.850]  She loves being on camera.
[24:48.350 --> 24:49.730]  People are addicted to it.
[24:50.350 --> 24:51.730]  Oh, is this...
[24:52.290 --> 24:56.870]  I thought this guy was going to pass his drink to his friend and temporarily be double fisted.
[24:59.310 --> 24:59.950]  Drop something!
[25:00.190 --> 25:01.710]  She dropped something!
[25:02.170 --> 25:02.870]  I didn't see what it was.
[25:03.390 --> 25:05.290]  It doesn't matter, she dropped it and picked it up.
[25:05.790 --> 25:08.030]  If it's food, I got two.
[25:08.170 --> 25:10.410]  But I think I'm just going to put something because I didn't see what it was.
[25:10.530 --> 25:11.550]  I couldn't tell what it was either.
[25:12.030 --> 25:13.030]  But she definitely...
[25:13.030 --> 25:15.490]  She dropped it and picked it up, so she didn't lit her.
[25:16.390 --> 25:16.710]  Damn.
[25:16.710 --> 25:19.050]  If we get pink taxi, I'll get it again.
[25:19.530 --> 25:19.970]  What?
[25:20.630 --> 25:20.870]  Yep.
[25:24.200 --> 25:26.060]  How are none of these people holding two drinks?
[25:26.400 --> 25:27.060]  It's insane.
[25:27.540 --> 25:29.700]  You can drink on the street in Florida?
[25:31.220 --> 25:32.280]  Uh, you can.
[25:32.540 --> 25:33.580]  In Key West, yeah.
[25:33.820 --> 25:34.360]  Oh, wow.
[25:34.940 --> 25:37.300]  That guy on the right should be barefoot.
[25:37.520 --> 25:39.100]  He has strong barefoot vibes.
[25:40.460 --> 25:41.700]  It's a shame he isn't.
[25:42.000 --> 25:46.540]  Don't worry, there's going to be a whole lot of people walking around with sandals in their hands at about midnight.
[25:47.080 --> 25:49.860]  So she's trying to get him to look up the stream, I think.
[25:50.280 --> 25:50.500]  Yeah.
[25:50.880 --> 25:53.100]  That should be on there, looking at the stream.
[25:53.500 --> 25:53.780]  Kobe!
[25:56.860 --> 25:59.960]  That guy looks like he's wearing a Lucy's Fried Chicken shirt from Austin.
[26:00.120 --> 26:01.180]  I wonder if they're local to us.
[26:02.080 --> 26:02.360]  The green shirt.
[26:02.360 --> 26:04.780]  I feel like I got really lucky with that early mullet.
[26:05.420 --> 26:06.300]  Yeah, no kidding.
[26:08.120 --> 26:09.100]  Yeah, you really did.
[26:09.260 --> 26:10.940]  Mullet is one of the rarer ones, actually.
[26:11.220 --> 26:12.240]  I will say,
[26:13.000 --> 26:14.920]  American flag clothes and cowboy hat,
[26:14.920 --> 26:17.080]  I thought were going to be two fucking gimme's.
[26:17.220 --> 26:17.620]  Nothing.
[26:18.040 --> 26:21.160]  Dude, American flag clothes are everywhere.
[26:21.500 --> 26:23.300]  Nothing tonight, dude.
[26:24.000 --> 26:24.940]  Spill your drink!
[26:26.660 --> 26:28.220]  Take off your shoes!
[26:33.240 --> 26:34.640]  It's amazing
[26:34.640 --> 26:37.580]  how much this stuff happens
[26:37.580 --> 26:38.980]  how constantly
[26:38.980 --> 26:40.660]  when you start watching it.
[26:41.540 --> 26:42.680]  If a dude
[26:42.680 --> 26:44.620]  ate shit and he was wearing
[26:44.620 --> 26:46.780]  flip flops and he lost the flip flops,
[26:47.000 --> 26:47.900]  would it be...
[26:47.900 --> 26:50.160]  If his bare foot hit the ground, yeah.
[26:50.280 --> 26:52.740]  If he gets up and walks around with no shoes.
[26:53.140 --> 26:53.180]  Yeah.
[26:54.540 --> 26:56.420]  Yeah, I think sole-to-ground contact
[26:56.420 --> 26:57.380]  is pretty barefoot.
[26:58.540 --> 27:00.140]  Oh, a little twerking over there!
[27:00.200 --> 27:00.660]  Did you see that?
[27:01.500 --> 27:01.940]  Where?
[27:02.940 --> 27:03.780]  Very briefly.
[27:04.820 --> 27:06.060]  She was shaking.
[27:07.920 --> 27:09.460]  I don't know whether that counts.
[27:09.460 --> 27:10.880]  It wasn't really a twerk.
[27:10.940 --> 27:12.900]  It was more of a butt shimmy.
[27:14.260 --> 27:15.260]  That's not a twerk, then.
[27:15.440 --> 27:17.460]  If you're describing it as it wasn't a twerk...
[27:18.360 --> 27:19.660]  It was very close.
[27:19.820 --> 27:21.720]  If she continued, it would have gone to twerk territory.
[27:23.380 --> 27:25.700]  I think twerking, you gotta arch a bit of back, right?
[27:26.060 --> 27:26.820]  Definitely, yeah.
[27:27.180 --> 27:29.900]  It requires a surprising
[27:29.900 --> 27:31.080]  amount of skill to
[27:31.080 --> 27:32.900]  watch everything at once.
[27:33.040 --> 27:34.520]  It gets overwhelming.
[27:34.880 --> 27:37.600]  I was trying to see if these people were going to get into this car
[27:37.600 --> 27:39.640]  and have it be the wrong car, and then I'm looking
[27:39.640 --> 27:41.760]  at the top, and there's just so much happening.
[27:42.280 --> 27:44.040]  I'm excited for people
[27:44.040 --> 27:45.460]  to be like, there was a double fist
[27:45.460 --> 27:46.100]  two minutes in.
[27:47.560 --> 27:48.540]  I'm sorry, what did you say, Andrew?
[27:49.100 --> 27:51.700]  I can't wait to see people saying, there was a double fist
[27:51.700 --> 27:53.220]  two minutes in, nobody saw it.
[27:54.020 --> 27:54.880]  We're gonna miss stuff.
[27:55.700 --> 27:57.620]  It's like making Let's Plays for the last
[27:57.620 --> 27:58.140]  12 years.
[28:01.380 --> 28:03.000]  That guy's got a sack lunch with him.
[28:04.840 --> 28:06.000]  Drop it, drop it, drop it.
[28:08.360 --> 28:09.440]  This is what it's like to work
[28:09.440 --> 28:10.000]  for the NSA.
[28:11.720 --> 28:13.260]  They make bingo out of it?
[28:13.840 --> 28:15.260]  I assume they get bored.
[28:17.380 --> 28:19.380]  Except the NSA are probably watching us
[28:19.380 --> 28:19.920]  watch this.
[28:23.480 --> 28:25.240]  I'm getting offended when I don't even see
[28:25.240 --> 28:26.780]  a single fist at this stage.
[28:26.980 --> 28:29.000]  That's gotta be a matching outfit, even though they're like
[28:29.000 --> 28:30.200]  complementary outfits.
[28:31.460 --> 28:33.200]  This is like when you describe twerk
[28:33.200 --> 28:34.040]  as a not twerk.
[28:35.300 --> 28:36.160]  I'm looking for
[28:36.160 --> 28:36.980]  stuff that isn't there.
[28:40.320 --> 28:41.560]  It gets hard
[28:41.560 --> 28:43.080]  because you want to see it so bad.
[28:43.180 --> 28:44.020]  Oh, so bad.
[28:46.760 --> 28:47.420]  Can't believe
[28:47.420 --> 28:48.460]  no one's hoofed it yet.
[28:48.720 --> 28:51.300]  Get separated. Crosswalk
[28:51.300 --> 28:52.300]  cowards, come on.
[28:58.850 --> 29:00.850]  Now we are getting closer and
[29:00.850 --> 29:02.930]  closer to slop o'clock as we progress.
[29:03.110 --> 29:03.890]  We really are, yeah.
[29:03.890 --> 29:05.810]  Is this going to get more
[29:05.810 --> 29:08.110]  rapid, Geoff, as we go further?
[29:08.190 --> 29:08.690]  Yeah, I think so.
[29:10.050 --> 29:11.010]  It's usually
[29:11.930 --> 29:14.090]  pretty wild. Look at that guy giving a piggyback
[29:14.090 --> 29:14.710]  ride to a kid.
[29:15.590 --> 29:17.490]  I hope you're going straight home.
[29:17.850 --> 29:18.510]  Straight home.
[29:19.890 --> 29:21.530]  Oh, is that an Arsenal shirt?
[29:22.310 --> 29:22.550]  What?
[29:24.350 --> 29:25.730]  He's wearing an Arsenal shirt.
[29:27.130 --> 29:28.070]  Is that offensive?
[29:28.990 --> 29:29.430]  To me?
[29:34.970 --> 29:36.090]  To me?
[29:38.990 --> 29:40.070]  That's fucking funny.
[29:40.150 --> 29:41.810]  Is that a pink taxi up there?
[29:42.550 --> 29:43.770]  Yeah, pink taxi!
[29:45.670 --> 29:47.270]  If that's pink taxi,
[29:47.550 --> 29:48.710]  I just got it again.
[29:48.970 --> 29:50.110]  Of course it's pink taxi.
[29:51.230 --> 29:52.110]  I got a second bingo.
[29:52.850 --> 29:55.110]  Dude, you're fucking killing it tonight.
[29:55.110 --> 29:56.110]  I'm happy about it.
[29:58.010 --> 29:59.150]  Dude, cigars are a
[29:59.150 --> 30:01.230]  relatively new addition. I've been seeing a lot of
[30:01.230 --> 30:03.050]  dudes smoking cigars lately. I wonder if
[30:03.050 --> 30:04.590]  a shop just opened up or something.
[30:04.970 --> 30:07.290]  Are they back? Maybe cigars are back.
[30:07.790 --> 30:09.410]  Oh, I have. I've been doing cigars.
[30:10.490 --> 30:10.930]  Oh, yeah?
[30:11.230 --> 30:13.070]  I bought like a butane lighter.
[30:13.290 --> 30:14.230]  I got like some cigars.
[30:14.490 --> 30:16.490]  It's occasional.
[30:16.910 --> 30:17.670]  I do it. It's nice.
[30:18.430 --> 30:19.790]  Do you snip the end off and do all that?
[30:19.970 --> 30:22.410]  Yeah. We had a cigar club at work for a little while.
[30:23.150 --> 30:24.150]  Who was in that?
[30:25.050 --> 30:26.070]  Me, Nick,
[30:27.330 --> 30:27.730]  Hector.
[30:28.550 --> 30:30.370]  There were like a handful of people.
[30:30.610 --> 30:32.710]  We would get like a bottle of port and have a cigar.
[30:33.670 --> 30:34.250]  At work?
[30:34.490 --> 30:36.250]  Yeah. After work. Is that allowed?
[30:36.490 --> 30:38.250]  Oh, after work. Yeah, it was like the end of the day.
[30:38.870 --> 30:40.250]  Oh, okay. Lunch break, baby.
[30:40.390 --> 30:40.510]  No.
[30:42.370 --> 30:44.510]  There was hesitation, but they went.
[30:44.630 --> 30:45.070]  God damn it.
[30:45.510 --> 30:48.230]  Oh, this guy in the
[30:48.970 --> 30:49.370]  red.
[30:51.970 --> 30:53.290]  That is a big
[30:53.290 --> 30:54.590]  fucking cigar.
[30:55.370 --> 30:56.650]  That thing is huge.
[30:58.290 --> 30:59.350]  I hope we see him
[30:59.350 --> 31:00.710]  smoke the whole thing right here.
[31:02.270 --> 31:03.430]  The guy on one
[31:03.430 --> 31:05.330]  side in the blue shorts and the sandals,
[31:05.410 --> 31:07.050]  he's been there the entire time.
[31:07.510 --> 31:09.630]  Yeah. He's just fucking chillin'.
[31:09.630 --> 31:11.470]  He's just chillin'. Having a good time.
[31:12.730 --> 31:13.370]  He's playing
[31:13.370 --> 31:14.750]  his own game of Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[31:14.750 --> 31:14.810]  Sloppy Joe.
[31:20.430 --> 31:21.930]  I'm so glad you found this.
[31:23.470 --> 31:24.670]  I love Sloppy Joe.
[31:24.670 --> 31:26.650]  I love this Sloppy Joe Bingo thing because
[31:27.650 --> 31:28.350]  it's like
[31:28.350 --> 31:30.490]  6th Street if everybody on 6th Street
[31:30.490 --> 31:31.870]  was 50 to 80.
[31:33.810 --> 31:34.390]  It's like
[31:34.390 --> 31:35.730]  the opposite of 6th Street.
[31:38.650 --> 31:39.650]  Oh, is that Mimo?
[31:40.250 --> 31:42.570]  Yeah, it's pretty close.
[31:42.570 --> 31:43.670]  That's a border.
[31:43.810 --> 31:45.870]  I can't see your face.
[31:46.650 --> 31:47.210]  It's hard.
[31:48.350 --> 31:49.070]  That's tough.
[31:49.590 --> 31:52.870]  If she's the same age as the guy...
[31:52.870 --> 31:53.410]  No, he's got a camera.
[31:55.650 --> 31:57.190]  I'm just gonna mock it.
[32:04.890 --> 32:05.210]  Yeah.
[32:06.250 --> 32:07.010]  That's fine.
[32:08.870 --> 32:10.450]  It's all about having fun.
[32:10.630 --> 32:12.430]  Oh, that's a Mimo.
[32:12.430 --> 32:13.830]  That's a Mimo, I think.
[32:14.710 --> 32:16.410]  No, she's way too mobile.
[32:17.410 --> 32:19.490]  She's walking well.
[32:20.390 --> 32:22.510]  She's closer to hoofing it
[32:22.510 --> 32:23.250]  than Mimo on it.
[32:30.110 --> 32:31.550]  That was a honk, though.
[32:32.370 --> 32:34.090]  That was more of a friendly honk.
[32:34.370 --> 32:36.650]  It didn't seem aggressive to me.
[32:37.610 --> 32:38.610]  Oh, look at that crosswalk coward.
[32:38.850 --> 32:40.610]  She's scared. She stepped out and she stepped back.
[32:40.850 --> 32:41.750]  Crosswalk coward.
[32:42.550 --> 32:43.650]  I didn't even see it.
[32:43.650 --> 32:44.390]  She won't do it.
[32:44.550 --> 32:45.950]  She keeps trying to pull it.
[32:46.330 --> 32:48.350]  That's definitely crosswalk coward.
[32:48.710 --> 32:49.190]  Wow.
[32:52.860 --> 32:53.930]  I don't have that one.
[32:56.010 --> 32:57.190]  Thank you very much.
[32:58.530 --> 32:58.950]  Cowboy hat.
[33:00.090 --> 33:01.070]  Cowboy hat.
[33:01.370 --> 33:02.070]  Cowboy hat.
[33:02.610 --> 33:04.090]  Absolutely a cowboy hat.
[33:04.830 --> 33:05.490]  Undeniable.
[33:07.590 --> 33:08.250]  Binwheels.
[33:10.830 --> 33:12.490]  What the fuck?
[33:12.490 --> 33:14.310]  Is that a trash can cart?
[33:15.350 --> 33:16.510]  Bin on wheel.
[33:16.610 --> 33:18.070]  That's what he's saying. Binwheels.
[33:18.870 --> 33:20.430]  What did you think I said?
[33:20.930 --> 33:22.150]  I didn't know what binwheels was.
[33:22.150 --> 33:24.210]  I thought somebody was Ben.
[33:25.070 --> 33:26.970]  Our good friend Benwheels.
[33:27.750 --> 33:29.030]  It's one of Gav's
[33:29.030 --> 33:29.870]  mini personalities.
[33:32.850 --> 33:34.550]  He's like Gavin, but a little
[33:34.550 --> 33:35.670]  less cheeky.
[33:38.290 --> 33:39.390]  A little bit more serious.
[33:43.230 --> 33:43.790]  Ooh.
[33:45.730 --> 33:46.690]  Dude, talk about
[33:46.690 --> 33:47.690]  contrasting colors.
[33:49.390 --> 33:50.510]  That shirt
[33:50.510 --> 33:52.730]  and those red shorts do not go together.
[33:53.150 --> 33:54.350]  I have that exact outfit.
[33:56.010 --> 33:58.250]  I think the same thing when you wear it.
[33:58.950 --> 33:59.970]  Look how fucking
[34:00.650 --> 34:01.530]  good to know.
[34:02.110 --> 34:03.390]  Look at that lady drunk walking.
[34:05.250 --> 34:06.610]  When you walk
[34:06.610 --> 34:08.270]  sideways as much as forward,
[34:08.670 --> 34:09.430]  you're drunk walking.
[34:09.430 --> 34:10.390]  You're having fun.
[34:13.310 --> 34:15.350]  I don't ever want to go here.
[34:17.550 --> 34:19.290]  I'm like never in my life.
[34:19.910 --> 34:21.370]  I think I literally heard
[34:21.370 --> 34:22.590]  someone go...
[34:28.670 --> 34:29.910]  One clit?
[34:30.050 --> 34:32.010]  Is that double fisting?
[34:34.150 --> 34:35.550]  That's double fisting!
[34:35.910 --> 34:36.930]  That's a double fist!
[34:36.930 --> 34:38.150]  That's a bingo!
[34:38.350 --> 34:39.050]  Did you get one?
[34:39.990 --> 34:41.710]  Andrew, second place!
[34:43.190 --> 34:43.710]  Wow.
[34:44.790 --> 34:46.130]  That's like a triple play.
[34:46.330 --> 34:46.710]  That's awesome.
[34:47.870 --> 34:49.230]  That is really incredible.
[34:49.990 --> 34:52.510]  And yes, Gavin, that guy
[34:52.510 --> 34:54.210]  Sash said one clit
[34:54.210 --> 34:56.630]  for life or something. He must be a bachelor party.
[34:57.130 --> 34:58.410]  So if anybody has
[34:58.410 --> 34:59.890]  a fencive shirt, that would count.
[35:02.290 --> 35:04.010]  Andrew, way to go. Second place.
[35:04.010 --> 35:06.090]  I mean, I got two bingos and then you finally got one
[35:06.090 --> 35:07.090]  so I got second place.
[35:07.410 --> 35:10.050]  Way to go, Andrew.
[35:11.110 --> 35:12.030]  Where's all the fucking beach
[35:12.030 --> 35:12.850]  goths at tonight?
[35:14.130 --> 35:15.090]  I know that
[35:15.730 --> 35:17.610]  we already got the bingos and everything.
[35:17.750 --> 35:20.010]  Can we just keep playing until the top of the hour maybe?
[35:20.510 --> 35:20.650]  Yeah.
[35:21.710 --> 35:23.110]  I'm having so much fun.
[35:23.590 --> 35:26.190]  I mean, I still have a bunch on my sheet to knock off.
[35:26.430 --> 35:27.910]  We can still try to black out the board.
[35:31.130 --> 35:31.930]  Most blacked out
[35:31.930 --> 35:32.550]  wins at the end.
[35:33.710 --> 35:36.030]  I am a wheelchair away
[35:36.030 --> 35:37.130]  from a double bingo.
[35:37.430 --> 35:38.430]  And it is so frustrating.
[35:43.320 --> 35:44.460]  He picked his nose!
[35:45.660 --> 35:46.240]  Nose pick!
[35:47.220 --> 35:48.740]  The guy in the backwards baseball cap.
[35:48.900 --> 35:51.760]  And now he's touching all of his stuff.
[35:52.400 --> 35:53.360]  All I need is selfie
[35:53.360 --> 35:54.340]  and I have another bingo.
[35:56.300 --> 35:57.440]  Man, you got the best card
[35:57.440 --> 35:57.900]  in the world.
[35:58.580 --> 36:00.720]  It really started slow, Gavin.
[36:00.720 --> 36:01.840]  It started so slow.
[36:02.200 --> 36:03.860]  Oh, they're like triple fisting over there.
[36:03.960 --> 36:05.020]  Look at all that booze they're carrying.
[36:09.720 --> 36:11.100]  Oh, that dude had a fanny pack
[36:11.100 --> 36:13.060]  and I thought he was just digging through his belt.
[36:13.660 --> 36:15.020]  Oh, is fanny pack one of them?
[36:15.660 --> 36:16.740]  Oh, is there a fanny pack, Geoff?
[36:17.560 --> 36:18.620]  Uh, no, there's not.
[36:18.680 --> 36:20.120]  But that's a good... we can always add that.
[36:21.620 --> 36:22.720]  Yeah, if you guys...
[36:22.720 --> 36:24.740]  if we run into anything that pops up enough
[36:24.740 --> 36:27.100]  I can always modify the list.
[36:27.720 --> 36:28.580]  It's an evolution.
[36:30.960 --> 36:31.440]  Dude...
[36:31.440 --> 36:32.500]  It's a living document, guys.
[36:33.020 --> 36:33.820]  The other night...
[36:34.440 --> 36:35.760]  It's like the declaration of independence.
[36:36.480 --> 36:37.100]  Or the constitution.
[36:39.360 --> 36:40.320]  It's our...
[36:40.320 --> 36:41.460]  It's the f*** face constitution.
[36:43.060 --> 36:44.700]  The other night, Emily and I were watching
[36:44.700 --> 36:46.520]  this lady, this like very
[36:47.780 --> 36:48.740]  fancy looking
[36:48.740 --> 36:50.160]  super rich lady.
[36:50.960 --> 36:53.040]  Maybe like early 50s, mid 50s.
[36:53.220 --> 36:54.440]  Was on the phone
[36:54.440 --> 36:56.740]  kind of like the dude in the black shirt
[36:56.740 --> 36:58.800]  right there. And she
[36:58.800 --> 37:00.160]  was having an argument with somebody.
[37:00.440 --> 37:02.400]  And she just for like a minute
[37:02.400 --> 37:03.820]  straight screamed,
[37:04.340 --> 37:06.820]  F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you!
[37:07.140 --> 37:08.520]  Like it was on loop.
[37:08.820 --> 37:09.780]  It was wild.
[37:11.220 --> 37:11.700]  You see some
[37:12.620 --> 37:13.100]  interesting
[37:15.680 --> 37:16.640]  interesting situations.
[37:17.020 --> 37:17.980]  That's a nice car.
[37:19.300 --> 37:20.260]  I mean, you have to be
[37:20.260 --> 37:22.160]  some kind of person to come here.
[37:24.600 --> 37:25.040]  Well,
[37:25.220 --> 37:26.060]  I think the appeal
[37:26.060 --> 37:28.060]  to Key West is fishing. So all these people
[37:28.060 --> 37:29.420]  probably really like fishing, right?
[37:29.700 --> 37:32.260]  It's these people and that guy who kept
[37:32.260 --> 37:34.200]  walking up to the camera over like the span
[37:34.200 --> 37:35.840]  of a weekend going, F*** face!
[37:36.180 --> 37:37.760]  F*** face, Geoff! Geoff!
[37:37.960 --> 37:40.140]  I'm here, Geoff! So it's just
[37:40.140 --> 37:41.660]  it's that kind of person, you know what I mean?
[37:42.020 --> 37:44.180]  There you go.
[37:48.490 --> 37:48.830]  Get
[37:48.830 --> 37:50.330]  separated in the crosswalk!
[37:53.510 --> 37:54.090]  Whoa!
[37:54.830 --> 37:56.190]  People are just taking
[37:56.190 --> 37:58.390]  drinks and getting across the road.
[37:58.710 --> 37:58.730]  Yep.
[38:00.430 --> 38:02.390]  There's a whole f***ing party going on across
[38:02.390 --> 38:03.690]  the road there. Yeah, no kidding.
[38:05.410 --> 38:06.310]  Is that FaceTime?
[38:06.430 --> 38:07.690]  Oh, it's texting.
[38:13.820 --> 38:14.660]  From the
[38:14.660 --> 38:16.440]  back, so many people look like
[38:16.440 --> 38:18.600]  Theo Vaughn. Like they all
[38:18.600 --> 38:19.260]  just have
[38:20.680 --> 38:22.020]  that kind of
[38:22.640 --> 38:23.920]  demeanor or look
[38:23.920 --> 38:25.660]  or something. It's really, it's weird.
[38:26.080 --> 38:27.880]  Yeah, this is definitely
[38:27.880 --> 38:29.100]  the Theo Vaughn crowd.
[38:29.920 --> 38:32.040]  That guy has the shirt from the Bachelorette
[38:32.040 --> 38:33.240]  party. He did!
[38:34.500 --> 38:35.880]  He's a part of the posse.
[38:36.280 --> 38:37.060]  Oh, another pink cab.
[38:38.600 --> 38:39.120]  Wow.
[38:42.220 --> 38:43.740]  See, the pink taxi again.
[38:44.840 --> 38:46.180]  Loser board, very cool.
[38:46.180 --> 38:47.680]  Loser board! That is a loser board.
[38:47.720 --> 38:48.720]  That is a loser board.
[38:52.480 --> 38:53.000]  Okay.
[38:58.320 --> 38:59.620]  I can't believe
[38:59.620 --> 39:00.660]  these streets are open.
[39:02.880 --> 39:03.920]  Like, 6th
[39:03.920 --> 39:05.580]  closes, and these are tight
[39:05.580 --> 39:07.020]  streets. That's crazy.
[39:07.680 --> 39:08.700]  They do not
[39:10.040 --> 39:11.240]  shut these streets down.
[39:11.900 --> 39:13.660]  At least, not that I've seen so far.
[39:14.900 --> 39:15.600]  That was a slightly
[39:15.600 --> 39:17.420]  accelerated run, but not hoofing it.
[39:17.960 --> 39:19.720]  Is there anything you're surprised we haven't seen
[39:19.720 --> 39:20.120]  yet, Geoff?
[39:21.940 --> 39:22.380]  Um...
[39:22.380 --> 39:24.340]  Is there anything you would normally see that would have popped by now?
[39:25.760 --> 39:26.200]  Uh...
[39:26.200 --> 39:28.200]  I mean, yeah. Whoa, what a beard.
[39:28.820 --> 39:30.100]  I'm surprised we've seen no
[39:30.100 --> 39:31.840]  cop car, fire truck, or ambulance.
[39:32.240 --> 39:33.940]  I'll be honest. Trip
[39:33.940 --> 39:36.220]  feels like it should have happened 100
[39:36.220 --> 39:37.980]  times. American
[39:37.980 --> 39:39.760]  flag close has not happened.
[39:40.100 --> 39:42.160]  That's crazy. That's probably the one I'm most
[39:42.160 --> 39:44.060]  surprised by, because I see probably 10 or
[39:44.060 --> 39:45.300]  15 a night. Not
[39:45.940 --> 39:47.100]  getting into the... like,
[39:47.700 --> 39:49.300]  trying to get into the wrong car.
[39:49.460 --> 39:50.560]  That hasn't happened either.
[39:51.200 --> 39:52.340]  That'll happen later.
[39:53.780 --> 39:55.280]  Slop o'clock. The night is young.
[39:55.620 --> 39:57.300]  Yeah. See, I think
[39:57.300 --> 39:59.280]  the bars are open till 4am
[39:59.280 --> 40:01.080]  here, but these
[40:01.080 --> 40:03.180]  people, they're done by about
[40:03.180 --> 40:04.400]  midnight. Yeah.
[40:04.900 --> 40:07.040]  They start pouring out at about 11,
[40:07.180 --> 40:08.260]  and then, hey, there's Bumblebee.
[40:08.700 --> 40:09.860]  That's a wasp with wheels. Oh, yeah.
[40:10.800 --> 40:11.320]  LAUGHTER
[40:16.860 --> 40:17.600]  I had
[40:17.600 --> 40:19.660]  a camo on for a while, but I took that off.
[40:20.500 --> 40:21.560]  There was a camo hat
[40:21.560 --> 40:21.920]  earlier.
[40:26.870 --> 40:28.090]  Aw, damn. Didn't honk.
[40:28.330 --> 40:30.470]  Dude, we've seen that Waves
[40:30.890 --> 40:32.590]  cowboy hat. Cowboy hat
[40:32.590 --> 40:33.350]  couple. Yup.
[40:34.210 --> 40:36.390]  Look at this guy. Yeah, it's back over
[40:36.390 --> 40:37.890]  that way. That's where the good stuff is.
[40:38.450 --> 40:39.570]  Alright, we'll go the other way.
[40:40.410 --> 40:40.810]  LAUGHTER
[40:41.790 --> 40:43.450]  Put your hat on so I can keep track of you.
[40:43.990 --> 40:46.630]  Some of these cars go so fast at this intersection.
[40:47.250 --> 40:48.010]  I have
[40:48.670 --> 40:49.950]  had moments where I thought
[40:49.950 --> 40:51.910]  I'm seeing a wheelchair, but it's just a scooter going
[40:52.410 --> 40:53.890]  by, and I'm like, holy fuck!
[40:54.710 --> 40:55.490]  They're moving.
[40:56.370 --> 40:57.830]  Oh, I've not been looking for
[40:57.830 --> 40:59.450]  nighttime shades again. Oh!
[41:00.430 --> 41:01.270]  Dude, you
[41:02.910 --> 41:03.810]  undeniably missed some.
[41:04.150 --> 41:05.910]  I don't know. I don't think so. You'll see
[41:05.910 --> 41:07.050]  them. They're pretty obvious.
[41:08.110 --> 41:09.870]  They stand out. See, as a
[41:09.870 --> 41:11.870]  sloppy joes amateur, my brain can only
[41:11.870 --> 41:13.890]  comprehend one thing, and I'm like
[41:13.890 --> 41:16.050]  blind to everything else. Yeah, I hear you.
[41:16.050 --> 41:18.030]  You look at one corner, and you're really
[41:18.030 --> 41:20.010]  stuck there instead of looking, like, further
[41:20.010 --> 41:21.190]  and seeing what else you can find.
[41:21.950 --> 41:24.010]  Oh, I was thinking about putting
[41:24.010 --> 41:26.150]  shirtless dude on. I haven't done that yet.
[41:26.330 --> 41:28.130]  I think shirtless dude should be on this list.
[41:28.610 --> 41:30.010]  Shirtless dude. Let me write that down.
[41:30.470 --> 41:32.130]  Shirtless dude also had a fanny pack.
[41:33.070 --> 41:33.470]  LAUGHTER
[41:33.470 --> 41:36.110]  Let's do fanny pack. I think that's a good one.
[41:36.710 --> 41:37.370]  Yeah, why not?
[41:39.090 --> 41:39.490]  Uh...
[41:39.990 --> 41:41.830]  Those are beach goths, right?
[41:42.390 --> 41:43.450]  Yeah, definitely a beach goth.
[41:43.450 --> 41:44.010]  Yes, yes, yes!
[41:46.550 --> 41:47.430]  You're not supposed to be
[41:47.430 --> 41:49.470]  at the beach, you're supposed to be in a cemetery somewhere.
[41:49.670 --> 41:50.670]  I heard...
[41:51.050 --> 41:53.230]  I heard seeing, but it wasn't aggressive.
[41:56.050 --> 41:57.410]  Oh, a pickup full of fish.
[41:57.450 --> 41:57.950]  Is that on there?
[41:59.630 --> 41:59.990]  LAUGHTER
[42:03.950 --> 42:04.310]  LAUGHTER
[42:06.010 --> 42:06.370]  LAUGHTER
[42:06.810 --> 42:07.170]  LAUGHTER
[42:07.170 --> 42:07.630]  LAUGHTER
[42:09.350 --> 42:10.950]  Is this Mustang lost?
[42:11.750 --> 42:12.630]  Oh, dude.
[42:13.350 --> 42:14.130]  Something different.
[42:14.610 --> 42:16.650]  It's like fucking high school all over again.
[42:16.970 --> 42:18.450]  You'll see four or five cars
[42:18.450 --> 42:20.890]  that have nothing better to do than drive past
[42:20.890 --> 42:22.970]  this webcam 3,000 times a night.
[42:23.210 --> 42:24.650]  Just desperate for any kind of
[42:24.650 --> 42:26.770]  anything interesting to happen to them, I guess.
[42:32.630 --> 42:33.110]  Separate!
[42:33.990 --> 42:35.130]  Separate in the crosswalk!
[42:35.650 --> 42:36.230]  Son of a bitch.
[42:37.590 --> 42:38.070]  LAUGHTER
[42:39.550 --> 42:40.810]  Fall. Fucking trip.
[42:41.030 --> 42:41.730]  Yeah, no kidding!
[42:42.890 --> 42:43.330]  Dude,
[42:43.730 --> 42:44.810]  I saw a guy...
[42:45.430 --> 42:47.770]  So you see where the dudes are going in
[42:47.770 --> 42:49.290]  above the cigarette smoking guy on the right?
[42:50.030 --> 42:51.830]  There's a step up to get
[42:51.830 --> 42:52.630]  into the bar there.
[42:54.090 --> 42:55.770]  A lot of people will fall coming
[42:55.770 --> 42:57.850]  out of there. I saw a dude the other night
[42:57.850 --> 42:59.750]  He did like a
[42:59.750 --> 43:00.490]  Paul George
[43:02.730 --> 43:03.610]  His leg...
[43:03.610 --> 43:05.530]  Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[43:05.550 --> 43:07.650]  His leg, he fell
[43:07.650 --> 43:09.650]  so hard, his knee bent backwards
[43:10.690 --> 43:11.490]  and then
[43:11.490 --> 43:13.250]  he was like maybe 60
[43:13.250 --> 43:15.670]  and then he just like, he tried to walk
[43:15.670 --> 43:17.750]  it off and he couldn't and they had to lay him
[43:17.750 --> 43:19.270]  into an Uber to get him out of there.
[43:19.270 --> 43:20.030]  No way!
[43:21.830 --> 43:23.250]  Oh, here's Bumblebee again.
[43:23.670 --> 43:24.070]  Jesus.
[43:27.750 --> 43:29.570]  I'll be honest, this little piece of like
[43:29.570 --> 43:31.410]  black tarmac thing
[43:31.410 --> 43:33.410]  on the floor, it looks so much like my
[43:33.410 --> 43:34.990]  tripod plate is distracting me.
[43:36.010 --> 43:37.330]  Oh, it does look like one.
[43:37.330 --> 43:38.710]  I think it's for the
[43:39.270 --> 43:40.890]  it's for water and stuff, right?
[43:41.130 --> 43:43.350]  Yeah. It's annoying
[43:43.350 --> 43:44.350]  because I'm looking for that.
[43:45.110 --> 43:45.910]  Oh, firetruck!
[43:47.850 --> 43:48.210]  Bingo.
[43:49.290 --> 43:49.650]  Nice!
[43:51.490 --> 43:52.810]  I am not good at this.
[43:52.830 --> 43:54.470]  Who doesn't have a bingo? Geoff and Gavin?
[43:55.110 --> 43:56.670]  I don't have one. I don't have one yet.
[43:56.890 --> 43:59.270]  But I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
[43:59.370 --> 44:00.910]  7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
[44:00.910 --> 44:02.370]  marked off. Oh my god.
[44:02.930 --> 44:04.590]  Let's keep going until you both get a bingo.
[44:04.590 --> 44:04.930]  Yeah.
[44:06.710 --> 44:08.590]  Yeah, I've got 3, 4, 5,
[44:08.630 --> 44:10.330]  6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[44:10.350 --> 44:12.270]  I have 13 marked off. I just don't have a bingo yet.
[44:15.990 --> 44:16.710]  Let's go!
[44:17.150 --> 44:17.630]  Let's go!
[44:17.630 --> 44:18.150]  Let's fucking go!
[44:18.650 --> 44:19.110]  Let's go!
[44:21.250 --> 44:21.650]  Trip.
[44:23.230 --> 44:24.630]  Is that the reverse
[44:24.630 --> 44:25.350]  of the wait up?
[44:25.910 --> 44:27.430]  That's a completely different thing right there.
[44:27.690 --> 44:29.450]  A let's go? A yell of a let's go?
[44:30.890 --> 44:32.050]  What kind of shirt?
[44:32.050 --> 44:33.510]  What the fuck is that?
[44:33.530 --> 44:36.230]  Did he buy that around the corner for $21?
[44:36.990 --> 44:37.350]  Yeah.
[44:37.990 --> 44:39.070]  His wife had one too.
[44:39.530 --> 44:41.710]  That lady was trying to hoof it,
[44:41.790 --> 44:42.850]  but she didn't quite have it in her.
[44:46.150 --> 44:48.350]  This is what I meant way, way earlier
[44:48.350 --> 44:49.710]  when I'm like, man, it's really crowded,
[44:49.870 --> 44:50.890]  then I bet it gets really dead.
[44:51.870 --> 44:53.530]  Oh, it gets really dead. They're gone.
[44:54.030 --> 44:54.690]  Everyone's gone.
[44:55.330 --> 44:56.770]  There's a guy dancing back there.
[44:57.250 --> 44:57.930]  See him? He's punching.
[44:57.930 --> 44:58.550]  He's punching.
[45:00.390 --> 45:01.270]  Oh, he's gone.
[45:02.170 --> 45:03.870]  At about 5am,
[45:04.230 --> 45:05.330]  the roosters come out.
[45:05.930 --> 45:07.530]  The what? The roosters.
[45:07.890 --> 45:09.770]  There's like chickens that just walk the streets.
[45:10.690 --> 45:12.030]  Like waking everyone up?
[45:12.230 --> 45:13.990]  Yeah. Oh, guy running.
[45:15.270 --> 45:16.090]  What the fuck?
[45:16.210 --> 45:16.950]  They're in the middle!
[45:20.050 --> 45:20.570]  What?
[45:21.710 --> 45:22.770]  Was that a drug deal?
[45:23.290 --> 45:24.570]  I don't know what that was.
[45:26.510 --> 45:27.970]  I thought it was maybe a...
[45:27.970 --> 45:29.310]  Nah, they...
[45:29.310 --> 45:31.150]  What does that mean?
[45:31.210 --> 45:32.250]  The hanky in the right pocket?
[45:32.610 --> 45:35.230]  I think he's local. I think he probably works at a bar or something.
[45:36.510 --> 45:38.090]  It's probably like a bar rag.
[45:39.430 --> 45:40.370]  There's a whole...
[45:40.370 --> 45:41.830]  Oh, he's gone! He's leaving!
[45:42.430 --> 45:42.630]  No!
[45:43.610 --> 45:44.050]  Goodbye.
[45:46.670 --> 45:47.530]  There's a whole like
[45:47.530 --> 45:49.290]  local community going on here that
[45:49.290 --> 45:51.890]  you start to see unfold
[45:51.890 --> 45:52.910]  if you watch it enough.
[45:52.910 --> 45:54.290]  I don't want to see it unfold.
[45:56.350 --> 45:56.970]  That guy
[45:56.970 --> 45:58.150]  stood there for almost an hour.
[45:58.470 --> 46:00.590]  Look at this dude
[46:01.390 --> 46:02.430]  bumbling across the street.
[46:02.510 --> 46:03.590]  Is he with them? No.
[46:04.450 --> 46:04.830]  Wait, is he?
[46:06.690 --> 46:07.110]  Separated!
[46:08.890 --> 46:10.190]  That was separated!
[46:10.450 --> 46:11.570]  That was crosswalk separated!
[46:12.150 --> 46:12.510]  Wait.
[46:13.790 --> 46:15.030]  I think you're right.
[46:15.970 --> 46:16.970]  Because look, he's with them now.
[46:17.090 --> 46:18.250]  He was separated at the crosswalk.
[46:18.250 --> 46:18.630]  I think you're right.
[46:19.290 --> 46:22.590]  Oh, it's so good!
[46:22.710 --> 46:23.430]  Come on!
[46:24.770 --> 46:26.430]  I want you guys to see the best stuff
[46:26.430 --> 46:28.130]  like a fight or somebody
[46:28.130 --> 46:30.310]  tripping. We'll have to do it on a Friday or
[46:30.310 --> 46:31.650]  a Saturday. Yeah.
[46:32.670 --> 46:34.310]  The go-kart's always fun to see.
[46:35.930 --> 46:37.130]  Yeah, I've seen...
[46:37.130 --> 46:38.170]  That guy...
[46:38.170 --> 46:40.190]  The security guard that just spit, he's got
[46:40.190 --> 46:41.230]  worse posture than I do.
[46:42.610 --> 46:43.570]  That's where I'm headed to.
[46:50.360 --> 46:51.000]  Matching shirts.
[46:53.440 --> 46:54.780]  Yeah, I thought I was going to be real reliant
[46:54.780 --> 46:56.720]  on the security. Having two security guys
[46:56.720 --> 46:57.820]  in one shot for my matching.
[46:58.620 --> 46:59.940]  I was surprised to get that earlier.
[47:00.580 --> 47:02.440]  Man, if I get a Meemaw in a go-kart,
[47:02.540 --> 47:04.360]  that'd be sick. That would be amazing.
[47:05.000 --> 47:06.040]  That would be a bingo for me.
[47:06.560 --> 47:07.260]  I believe in you.
[47:09.940 --> 47:11.800]  I would sacrifice my bingo
[47:11.800 --> 47:13.720]  for that moment, Gavin, so you could have that.
[47:13.900 --> 47:15.160]  I want to see Meemaw in a go-kart.
[47:15.660 --> 47:17.780]  That guy had a Tasmania shirt?
[47:26.170 --> 47:27.110]  That dude's tall.
[47:29.950 --> 47:31.490]  What'd you say, like 6'4"?
[47:31.990 --> 47:32.930]  Yeah, he has to be.
[47:33.130 --> 47:33.950]  How big is his back?
[47:34.550 --> 47:35.830]  How many inches do you think his back is?
[47:35.950 --> 47:38.310]  How tall would you say those children are
[47:38.310 --> 47:40.370]  who shouldn't be out at fuckin' 11 o'clock
[47:40.370 --> 47:41.170]  on Thursday night?
[47:42.330 --> 47:43.470]  Shouldn't he be in school?
[47:46.070 --> 47:47.110]  Wait, is that...
[47:47.110 --> 47:48.290]  Is that a guy sitting on the street?
[47:48.290 --> 47:49.390]  Is that a street?
[47:49.810 --> 47:50.210]  What is that?
[47:53.010 --> 47:53.610]  He's sitting,
[47:54.230 --> 47:54.890]  but it's just a street.
[47:55.330 --> 47:57.070]  The guy down at the very top
[47:58.470 --> 47:59.350]  across the street.
[47:59.450 --> 48:00.330]  That's sitting on the street, right?
[48:00.610 --> 48:02.030]  There's a guy sitting on a stool,
[48:02.270 --> 48:04.190]  and then he was definitely sitting on the street.
[48:04.190 --> 48:06.170]  I was looking at the fire hydrant.
[48:06.330 --> 48:09.110]  That gives me a bingo.
[48:09.490 --> 48:10.050]  Does it really?
[48:11.390 --> 48:11.750]  Congrats.
[48:12.490 --> 48:13.770]  Alright, now we're just doing Gavin.
[48:14.530 --> 48:15.770]  I just need my Meemaw.
[48:20.910 --> 48:21.310]  Who's...
[48:21.310 --> 48:24.170]  2, 4, 6, 8...
[48:24.170 --> 48:25.350]  I only have...
[48:25.350 --> 48:26.770]  FaceTime! FaceTime call!
[48:28.270 --> 48:28.870]  Oh, did you get it?
[48:28.970 --> 48:30.370]  I saw the FaceTime screen.
[48:31.010 --> 48:33.510]  I only need 10 to clear the board.
[48:33.610 --> 48:34.330]  How close are y'all?
[48:35.490 --> 48:38.550]  I need 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...
[48:38.550 --> 48:38.830]  10.
[48:39.230 --> 48:40.090]  I need 12.
[48:40.090 --> 48:40.550]  Man.
[48:41.430 --> 48:42.170]  Sweaty guy.
[48:42.530 --> 48:45.670]  I think we take it to where Gavin gets a bingo and we call it.
[48:45.870 --> 48:47.130]  We've been doing it for almost an hour,
[48:47.330 --> 48:49.550]  and I do want to do this again
[48:50.230 --> 48:51.890]  as a livestream with people.
[48:52.010 --> 48:53.070]  I think it would be a lot of fun.
[48:53.170 --> 48:54.190]  We just have to do more.
[48:54.510 --> 48:55.530]  Now we know it works.
[48:55.650 --> 48:57.750]  This is great.
[48:58.030 --> 48:59.130]  Is that Meemaw?
[48:59.650 --> 48:59.850]  Where?
[49:00.850 --> 49:01.750]  Oh, right in front?
[49:05.330 --> 49:06.210]  Too spry.
[49:06.210 --> 49:06.810]  So what?
[49:07.490 --> 49:08.410]  She's like elderly.
[49:10.510 --> 49:12.450]  Gavin, I wanted that for you too.
[49:12.530 --> 49:12.930]  I'm sorry.
[49:15.170 --> 49:16.370]  God, she...
[49:16.370 --> 49:18.290]  Nah, she's younger
[49:18.290 --> 49:19.110]  than she looks.
[49:20.210 --> 49:21.410]  Jesus Christ.
[49:21.730 --> 49:22.050]  Bummer.
[49:24.870 --> 49:26.390]  Hey, we all age differently.
[49:30.090 --> 49:31.990]  I thought that guy was barefoot.
[49:35.170 --> 49:35.750]  Man, Gavin,
[49:35.750 --> 49:36.690]  I thought you were going to win too.
[49:36.750 --> 49:37.710]  I thought you had the best card.
[49:37.910 --> 49:38.210]  Me too.
[49:38.350 --> 49:42.330]  I didn't think I had a shot in this thing.
[49:43.290 --> 49:44.550]  One thing I've never seen
[49:44.550 --> 49:45.850]  that I'm desperate to see
[49:45.850 --> 49:47.730]  is somebody fall off a scooter.
[49:48.070 --> 49:49.230]  Or a bike.
[49:49.590 --> 49:51.790]  I guess there's that clip of the lady
[49:51.790 --> 49:53.850]  in the 69 shirt who falls off her bike.
[49:54.050 --> 49:54.630]  That was funny.
[49:56.410 --> 49:57.870]  That kid's fucking hammered.
[49:57.890 --> 49:59.250]  Who the fuck?
[49:59.250 --> 50:00.610]  That guy didn't move.
[50:01.090 --> 50:02.690]  Zero reaction at all.
[50:09.420 --> 50:12.580]  Okay, okay.
[50:13.320 --> 50:14.420]  I think...
[50:14.420 --> 50:17.320]  I think you might...
[50:17.320 --> 50:19.620]  I think you might have a memaw there.
[50:20.360 --> 50:20.780]  Where? Which?
[50:22.300 --> 50:23.740]  Right there.
[50:24.000 --> 50:24.580]  In front of you?
[50:24.580 --> 50:27.420]  The lady who's being helped
[50:27.420 --> 50:28.220]  across the street.
[50:28.220 --> 50:28.320]  Oh yeah!
[50:29.460 --> 50:30.440]  That's a memaw!
[50:31.420 --> 50:31.900]  Hey!
[50:34.160 --> 50:34.780]  We did it!
[50:35.740 --> 50:36.900]  That's not bingo. Oh yes it is.
[50:37.300 --> 50:38.680]  Jesus Christ!
[50:40.780 --> 50:41.260]  Guys,
[50:41.880 --> 50:44.600]  we all got a bingo on Sloppy Joe's.
[50:44.960 --> 50:46.140]  This is fucking awesome.
[50:46.660 --> 50:47.980]  This was so good.
[50:48.420 --> 50:49.700]  We have to do this again
[50:49.700 --> 50:52.060]  and we have to do it like a livestream with people.
[50:52.180 --> 50:53.080]  This is a fucking blast.
[50:55.060 --> 50:56.420]  Let us know if you'd watch
[50:56.420 --> 50:57.980]  this live with us.
[50:58.220 --> 50:59.560]  I think they definitely would.
[50:59.880 --> 51:02.320]  This is but an amuse-bouche
[51:02.320 --> 51:03.620]  for what's to come.
[51:04.820 --> 51:05.700]  It gets...
[51:05.700 --> 51:07.280]  That guy's got a sack lunch too.
[51:07.600 --> 51:10.200]  It gets wilder as the night goes on.
[51:10.360 --> 51:12.720]  The next time we do it, we'll do it on a Friday or a Saturday.
[51:13.020 --> 51:14.580]  A little bit closer to Slop O'Clock
[51:15.120 --> 51:15.560]  and
[51:16.140 --> 51:17.640]  maybe we'll start at Slop O'Clock
[51:17.640 --> 51:20.560]  and then it gets fun.
[51:22.340 --> 51:24.600]  Well guys, we did it. Sloppy Joe's bingo.
[51:25.680 --> 51:26.560]  That's a wrap
[51:26.560 --> 51:28.720]  on it. Geoff, you are the mastermind
[51:28.720 --> 51:30.720]  behind this thing. I'm really...
[51:30.720 --> 51:32.260]  I said it a bunch during this record.
[51:32.600 --> 51:34.320]  I'm so happy you figured this out.
[51:35.160 --> 51:36.400]  Is there anything
[51:36.400 --> 51:38.340]  you want to tell the people before we
[51:38.340 --> 51:40.480]  close down the Sloppy Joe's for the night?
[51:41.880 --> 51:42.460]  Nah, just
[51:42.460 --> 51:44.520]  thanks for watching. If you like it,
[51:44.640 --> 51:46.520]  let us know and if you really
[51:46.520 --> 51:48.500]  do enjoy doing this and you want to see us
[51:48.500 --> 51:50.500]  do it more, don't fucking ruin it
[51:50.500 --> 51:50.960]  for us.
[51:52.080 --> 51:52.560]  Yup.
[51:52.820 --> 51:53.780]  You know what I mean?
[51:56.160 --> 51:57.520]  Be cool, man.
[51:57.760 --> 51:58.600]  Be fucking cool.
[51:58.960 --> 52:01.000]  If everybody's fucking cool as a cucumber,
[52:01.300 --> 52:03.020]  if we're all Charlie Brown, we're gonna be
[52:03.020 --> 52:03.660]  fine.
[52:05.740 --> 52:07.260]  Alright, well thanks for watching.
[52:07.460 --> 52:09.280]  Guys, we'll see you next time for Sloppy Joe's
[52:09.280 --> 52:10.740]  bingo. Bye.
[52:11.180 --> 52:11.660]  Bye.
