[00:14.660 --> 00:19.740]  Hello, and welcome to another piece of supplemental f***face content.
[00:20.240 --> 00:30.940]  This one is the long-teased-and-awaited viewing of MVP2, Most Vertical Primate, as led by Andrew
[00:30.940 --> 00:31.220]  Panton.
[00:31.320 --> 00:35.100]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, and somewhere around here is Gavin Free as well.
[00:36.560 --> 00:40.240]  He's known as our second favorite British guy behind Dr. Peabody.
[00:41.940 --> 00:43.160]  Andrew, take it away.
[00:43.920 --> 00:45.260]  This is MVP2.
[00:45.560 --> 00:46.180]  We're about to start.
[00:46.280 --> 00:47.440]  We just did the presentation.
[00:47.840 --> 00:49.600]  I want to know, how long did that take?
[00:49.640 --> 00:50.680]  Was that like 15 minutes?
[00:50.720 --> 00:52.000]  How long did that end up going?
[00:52.200 --> 00:54.840]  Yeah, you were right around, with your whole presentation, you were right around 15.
[00:55.100 --> 00:57.340]  And you can watch that on our YouTube channel.
[00:57.640 --> 00:57.820]  Yep.
[00:58.120 --> 00:58.620]  Yes, you can.
[00:58.960 --> 01:01.240]  So this is MVP2, as I talked about before.
[01:01.380 --> 01:05.520]  This is the movie that convinced me that I could immediately start skateboarding.
[01:05.580 --> 01:07.680]  Like with no practice at all.
[01:07.680 --> 01:14.100]  I got a skateboard because of this film, attempted to do it once, bailed really hard, did the
[01:14.100 --> 01:15.900]  splits, never skateboarded again.
[01:16.380 --> 01:17.380]  That's my journey.
[01:17.740 --> 01:20.920]  But I'm hoping that you both enjoy this MVP2 journey.
[01:21.040 --> 01:24.000]  I haven't watched this movie in probably like 18 years.
[01:24.580 --> 01:26.200]  Didn't you also flip off someone in a car?
[01:26.300 --> 01:26.800]  Is that related?
[01:27.900 --> 01:29.500]  I don't think that...
[01:29.500 --> 01:31.180]  No, that's a completely different story.
[01:32.100 --> 01:37.180]  I saw somebody flip somebody off in a car, and I didn't know what it meant, so I just
[01:37.180 --> 01:41.100]  stood in front of my house and I waited for the next car to drive by and I flipped them
[01:41.100 --> 01:44.640]  off and then gauged their reaction on whether it was a positive or negative.
[01:44.980 --> 01:46.860]  For some reason, I thought you had a skateboard with you when you did that.
[01:46.920 --> 01:47.600]  No, I did not.
[01:47.940 --> 01:48.960]  I probably should have.
[01:49.360 --> 01:50.860]  I wonder what episode...
[01:50.860 --> 01:56.140]  I feel like that you mentioning that you decided to learn to skate from The Monkey in MVP2
[01:56.560 --> 01:59.020]  must have been like in the first 20 episodes of F*** Face.
[01:59.580 --> 02:00.000]  It's gotta be.
[02:00.000 --> 02:00.320]  Could have been 16.
[02:00.960 --> 02:01.360]  Very...
[02:01.360 --> 02:02.240]  Oh yeah, that's possible.
[02:02.440 --> 02:04.240]  Very early on in F*** Face lore.
[02:04.920 --> 02:10.100]  I'm excited that after these many years and 127 episodes of the main show, we're finally
[02:10.840 --> 02:13.780]  getting to dig into such an inspirational piece of content.
[02:14.060 --> 02:14.640]  I'm excited.
[02:14.980 --> 02:16.540]  There's some good cameos in this.
[02:16.620 --> 02:22.600]  There is some... there's at least one character in this movie that you'll have additional
[02:22.600 --> 02:24.640]  context for going into MVP2.
[02:25.000 --> 02:26.240]  And it's not who you expect.
[02:26.800 --> 02:27.580]  Just leave it at that.
[02:28.160 --> 02:30.440]  I don't expect any of them, so...
[02:30.440 --> 02:31.780]  Well, you know, we had a talk.
[02:31.860 --> 02:35.460]  You know that somebody else from the first one is in this one, so I'm saying it's a different
[02:35.460 --> 02:39.240]  person that returns in a more official way.
[02:39.500 --> 02:40.700]  I wonder if this is even going to show up.
[02:40.740 --> 02:41.080]  Oh, it does.
[02:41.340 --> 02:47.200]  Do you guys have any... any guess on what the domestic... what the worldwide gross on
[02:47.200 --> 02:47.960]  this movie is?
[02:49.460 --> 02:51.340]  Oh, I'm going to say...
[02:51.740 --> 02:55.300]  I'm going to say six million dollars worldwide.
[02:56.060 --> 02:58.780]  It opened at $99,518.
[02:59.160 --> 02:59.980]  Opening weekend.
[03:02.820 --> 03:05.180]  Domestic and worldwide gross were the same.
[03:05.320 --> 03:06.460]  I guess it didn't go wide.
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.760]  The movie grossed $1.248 million.
[03:10.240 --> 03:14.960]  Yeah, I was going to say, I remember seeing the first MVP in a movie theater, and I watched
[03:14.960 --> 03:17.620]  this one on VHS, because I think it went straight there.
[03:18.480 --> 03:20.540]  This is a straight-to-video sequel.
[03:20.780 --> 03:23.160]  The sequel did not get a theatrical release.
[03:24.940 --> 03:26.100]  What was the budget?
[03:26.600 --> 03:27.060]  Oh, shit.
[03:27.080 --> 03:27.620]  I just closed it.
[03:27.640 --> 03:28.040]  Let me see.
[03:28.080 --> 03:28.380]  Hold on.
[03:28.880 --> 03:30.040]  It has to be long.
[03:30.480 --> 03:31.220]  I don't know if it listed it.
[03:31.240 --> 03:31.600]  Let's see.
[03:32.540 --> 03:33.760]  Most Valuable Primate, 2000.
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.100]  It is listed under comedy, family, sport.
[03:37.980 --> 03:39.820]  Uh... does not list the budget.
[03:40.340 --> 03:40.620]  Okay.
[03:41.140 --> 03:42.020]  Yeah, unfortunately.
[03:42.180 --> 03:42.360]  Okay.
[03:42.700 --> 03:47.820]  MVP 2 budget for Most Vertical Primate, $2 million USD.
[03:47.840 --> 03:48.220]  Oh!
[03:48.780 --> 03:49.220]  Really?
[03:49.220 --> 03:53.700]  They gave that movie to us, and they paid $800,000 to do so.
[03:53.820 --> 03:56.080]  It cost a lot of money to book Bob Byrnquist.
[03:56.360 --> 03:56.840]  He's a lot.
[03:56.920 --> 03:57.480]  He's a big star.
[03:58.080 --> 03:58.560]  Bob Byrnquist.
[03:58.660 --> 03:59.500]  Is Bob Byrnquist in this?
[03:59.580 --> 04:00.040]  Are you spoiling it?
[04:00.040 --> 04:00.520]  Yes, he is.
[04:00.880 --> 04:02.180]  You know, it's in the trailer.
[04:02.220 --> 04:05.140]  I don't think it's earned the credits in the trailer.
[04:05.540 --> 04:05.900]  Fair enough.
[04:05.940 --> 04:06.420]  You'll see him quick.
[04:07.020 --> 04:07.680]  Okay, you guys ready?
[04:08.180 --> 04:09.640]  I am so ready for this.
[04:09.720 --> 04:10.000]  Okay.
[04:10.280 --> 04:11.660]  The beginning of this movie is so good.
[04:12.100 --> 04:14.400]  So I've rented this on Amazon Prime.
[04:14.400 --> 04:20.320]  Well, I guess Amazon, because you can watch it for free on Amazon with ads.
[04:20.480 --> 04:25.380]  But in order to give you the full unfettered experience, there are no ads.
[04:25.460 --> 04:28.780]  So I've paid the $2, I believe, to rent this.
[04:30.120 --> 04:32.360]  What's going to happen is that you can rent it as well.
[04:32.500 --> 04:35.960]  I think you can watch it for free on Tubi, but syncing it up with us is going to be a headache.
[04:36.120 --> 04:40.820]  So if there are ads there, you might want to just go for MVP 2 on Amazon.
[04:41.360 --> 04:44.500]  I'm going to count down 3, 2, 1, now.
[04:44.760 --> 04:47.440]  And then on now, you're going to hit play along with us.
[04:47.600 --> 04:49.060]  And then that will have you synced up.
[04:49.420 --> 04:51.020]  Yeah, well, let's see if it works.
[04:51.420 --> 04:54.820]  Should we endeavor not to hit pause at any point?
[04:55.000 --> 04:55.880]  Just to go all the way through?
[04:56.440 --> 04:58.140]  Yes, we should not hit pause at all.
[04:58.440 --> 04:59.180]  Okay, just making sure.
[04:59.300 --> 05:00.340]  Everybody understands that.
[05:00.680 --> 05:00.980]  Mm-hmm.
[05:01.420 --> 05:03.000]  You good? You see my screen? We're good?
[05:03.440 --> 05:03.800]  Yeah.
[05:04.300 --> 05:05.900]  We're going to have to update these totals now.
[05:06.040 --> 05:07.380]  Can you test your audio?
[05:08.480 --> 05:10.340]  Okay, I'll play it.
[05:10.340 --> 05:12.140]  We'll start it, and then I will...
[05:12.140 --> 05:12.320]  Sounds great.
[05:12.660 --> 05:13.680]  Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[05:13.720 --> 05:14.280]  Sounds great.
[05:14.860 --> 05:15.700]  So there's that.
[05:16.340 --> 05:17.940]  I'm going to pause it right at the very beginning.
[05:18.020 --> 05:18.580]  Jog it back.
[05:18.680 --> 05:19.340]  We'll get it going.
[05:19.500 --> 05:20.100]  Here we go.
[05:20.520 --> 05:21.500]  This has ads in it.
[05:22.340 --> 05:24.120]  I paid for it to not have ads.
[05:24.500 --> 05:25.240]  I'm just saying.
[05:25.380 --> 05:27.380]  It said free-v, free with ads.
[05:27.780 --> 05:28.900]  But I paid for it.
[05:29.260 --> 05:30.380]  Then I'm seeing ad breaks.
[05:33.020 --> 05:34.180]  I've paid for it.
[05:34.400 --> 05:35.720]  Wait, you paid...
[05:36.080 --> 05:38.880]  You ordered the $2 standard deaf version instead of...
[05:38.880 --> 05:39.560]  No, no, no, no.
[05:39.560 --> 05:42.300]  I paid for the high-definition version.
[05:43.240 --> 05:44.260]  Are you on the right account?
[05:44.920 --> 05:45.280]  Yes.
[05:46.240 --> 05:50.800]  I have not left the fucking page.
[05:51.660 --> 05:52.260]  This is the...
[05:52.260 --> 05:54.800]  I ordered it, and I did not close this window.
[05:55.520 --> 05:57.340]  Maybe if you refresh it?
[05:57.500 --> 05:58.680]  Yeah, maybe you've got to do a refresh.
[05:59.100 --> 05:59.960]  Jesus Christ.
[06:00.520 --> 06:02.100]  You didn't do it for MVP1, did you?
[06:02.620 --> 06:02.920]  No.
[06:03.200 --> 06:05.820]  Again, I didn't close this window.
[06:06.700 --> 06:09.480]  I didn't know this was produced by Air Bud Entertainment.
[06:09.880 --> 06:10.700]  Oh, yeah, it is.
[06:11.060 --> 06:13.100]  Yeah, Robert Vince has directed all those movies.
[06:13.400 --> 06:16.500]  We're going to get it started, and if there are ads, I'm going to jump out a window.
[06:20.160 --> 06:20.800]  Let's do it.
[06:21.040 --> 06:22.140]  I'm going to jog it up.
[06:22.220 --> 06:22.700]  We're going to get it.
[06:22.760 --> 06:23.360]  See, no ads.
[06:23.420 --> 06:24.500]  There we go.
[06:24.640 --> 06:25.520]  All right, here we go.
[06:26.020 --> 06:26.640]  On now.
[06:26.840 --> 06:28.560]  Are you ready for MVP2?
[06:29.020 --> 06:33.380]  Audience, if you bought this, be sure to refresh before this moment.
[06:33.380 --> 06:37.840]  Don't sit on the page and go, surely this will be the way to do it, because it's not.
[06:38.080 --> 06:38.900]  Okay, here we go.
[06:39.700 --> 06:41.780]  Three, two, one, now.
[06:44.240 --> 06:45.320]  That sounds great, Eric.
[06:46.040 --> 06:47.580]  Actually, can we do this another time?
[06:50.580 --> 06:52.360]  I'm watching MVP2 right now.
[06:53.060 --> 06:54.020]  You can go if you have to.
[06:54.080 --> 06:57.440]  If Gavin said, no, seriously, I have a film crew outside, I forgot.
[06:57.880 --> 06:58.920]  I would not be surprised.
[07:00.160 --> 07:01.200]  He's like, I had to shoot a TV show.
[07:03.160 --> 07:05.720]  Did Robert Vince direct the first one as well?
[07:06.240 --> 07:06.600]  Yes, he did.
[07:06.680 --> 07:08.520]  He's directed, I think, every Air Bud movie.
[07:08.740 --> 07:10.120]  Like all of the Air Bud entertainment.
[07:10.260 --> 07:11.400]  I think that's all he does.
[07:11.520 --> 07:13.440]  This guy's the Steven Spielberg of animal movies.
[07:13.860 --> 07:15.580]  So it's actually just called MVP again.
[07:16.060 --> 07:16.140]  Really?
[07:16.940 --> 07:17.280]  Okay.
[07:18.160 --> 07:19.300]  Is this El Simeon?
[07:19.980 --> 07:21.060]  I guess it is.
[07:21.140 --> 07:23.260]  Yeah, I don't remember it starting this way.
[07:24.660 --> 07:27.260]  So all the monkeys in the monkey...
[07:27.960 --> 07:31.660]  Well, all the chimpanzees in the nature preserve wear human clothes in nature?
[07:32.480 --> 07:33.380]  I guess so, yeah.
[07:33.980 --> 07:37.420]  That's, I believe, Jack and his brother Louie, I want to say.
[07:38.120 --> 07:40.240]  Wait, he had a brother this whole time?
[07:40.920 --> 07:43.260]  Yeah, but it's not at all important to the first film.
[07:43.320 --> 07:44.760]  He gets introduced in the second one.
[07:48.240 --> 07:50.420]  So only two of them wear clothes?
[07:51.400 --> 07:52.140]  Just, yeah.
[07:52.780 --> 07:54.800]  Do you think the other monkeys hate them?
[07:54.800 --> 07:54.920]  I don't know.
[07:58.040 --> 07:59.140]  There's Bob Burnquist.
[08:00.060 --> 08:00.720]  Goin' ape!
[08:01.500 --> 08:02.940]  That company no longer exists.
[08:03.000 --> 08:04.260]  I wonder if they're still in business.
[08:04.920 --> 08:05.820]  No, they're not.
[08:06.260 --> 08:08.460]  We will never get movies like this made ever again.
[08:09.380 --> 08:12.400]  Y'all have seen Nope, right? Isn't this kind of how that movie started?
[08:14.560 --> 08:16.600]  Yes, that's exactly what it was.
[08:16.860 --> 08:17.040]  Yeah.
[08:20.900 --> 08:26.200]  So Andrew, this is like a good shit film, or is it a shit film, or is this genuinely a good film?
[08:26.680 --> 08:28.420]  Well, as a ten-year-old...
[08:28.420 --> 08:28.840]  In your memory.
[08:29.140 --> 08:34.400]  In my memory, this was just a genuine great movie, but I think this is a shit good film?
[08:34.980 --> 08:36.840]  We'll find out if it's just a shit film.
[08:37.140 --> 08:39.200]  That's how I would classify Dunstan. I would classify it as shit, but good.
[08:39.500 --> 08:40.940]  No, Dunstan's just good.
[08:41.320 --> 08:42.240]  I don't...
[08:43.080 --> 08:46.540]  I think Dunstan's just good. I do think, though, we need to come up with a rating system.
[08:46.880 --> 08:50.140]  And when this is all said and done, we need to decide which we liked better.
[08:50.640 --> 08:52.860]  MVP 2 or The Tuxedo.
[08:53.340 --> 08:53.540]  Yeah.
[08:53.540 --> 08:56.080]  Him and his brother read an NHL magazine.
[08:56.380 --> 08:56.940]  Well, yeah, of course.
[08:58.820 --> 09:02.540]  It's funny, I don't remember... I remember this movie opening completely differently.
[09:02.660 --> 09:02.680]  What?
[09:04.420 --> 09:06.500]  So they missed the hockey life.
[09:07.680 --> 09:10.720]  Yeah, clearly. And Louis wants to be involved in the hockey life.
[09:11.420 --> 09:13.460]  This is insane to watch.
[09:13.920 --> 09:15.500]  He's got the old Nuggets outfit.
[09:23.510 --> 09:24.470]  Yeah, he is...
[09:24.470 --> 09:25.330]  He doesn't like it.
[09:25.890 --> 09:26.550]  Who can play him?
[09:26.550 --> 09:27.450]  Jack has a mean slap shot.
[09:30.790 --> 09:31.310]  ZHL.
[09:35.980 --> 09:37.880]  Nobody watches ZHL.
[09:38.040 --> 09:40.560]  That guy on the right, that's exactly where my forehead is going.
[09:49.290 --> 09:52.530]  Does his shirt just say Drill? And there's a picture of a drill bit?
[09:52.570 --> 09:54.430]  It's such a 90s shirt.
[09:55.270 --> 09:57.530]  It's such a 90s skate culture shirt.
[09:58.310 --> 10:00.650]  So there's a team called the Simeons.
[10:01.030 --> 10:02.950]  That are unrelated to the Nuggets.
[10:02.950 --> 10:06.610]  Or the Simeon... El Simeon Nature Preserve.
[10:07.350 --> 10:07.790]  Yes.
[10:08.310 --> 10:09.090]  That's a lot of coincidence.
[10:09.790 --> 10:10.710]  There is a lot of coincidence.
[10:34.060 --> 10:37.380]  Dude, there is nothing better than a hot dog at a game.
[10:37.680 --> 10:38.800]  Do you get hot dogs on the ice?
[10:44.740 --> 10:45.300]  Oh god.
[10:49.280 --> 10:52.480]  Now, was she in the first one at all at the end?
[10:52.920 --> 10:53.820]  Like when he went home?
[11:00.360 --> 11:01.320]  Which one's Jack?
[11:02.380 --> 11:03.360]  He's the bigger one.
[11:03.620 --> 11:04.800]  Hey Gav, I got a question for you.
[11:04.800 --> 11:05.300]  Yeah.
[11:05.860 --> 11:08.200]  Do you think Andrew's still here? I haven't heard him in a while.
[11:08.640 --> 11:09.680]  No, I don't think so.
[11:09.740 --> 11:10.640]  No, I don't think so either.
[11:11.020 --> 11:12.220]  Okay, just making sure.
[11:12.540 --> 11:13.920]  I'm really glad that we can't pause.
[11:16.780 --> 11:18.600]  Andrew just dropped us off at the movie.
[11:21.040 --> 11:24.060]  He's gonna be around in 90 minutes in the station wagon to pick us up.
[11:25.540 --> 11:25.940]  Hello?
[11:33.320 --> 11:34.040]  Oh no.
[11:35.180 --> 11:36.180]  I'm so sorry.
[11:36.180 --> 11:40.700]  It sucks that our monkey expert isn't here to answer.
[11:41.480 --> 11:46.280]  Because I know he wasn't an important part of the first one, but I'd love a little more backstory into Jack's family.
[11:46.460 --> 11:47.180]  And if his brother...
[11:48.320 --> 11:50.180]  Let's see if his fucking...
[11:51.240 --> 11:52.200]  How is this possible?
[11:53.260 --> 11:55.680]  Oh, he just got drafted to the ZHL.
[11:56.720 --> 11:57.060]  What?
[11:58.140 --> 11:58.920]  Oh no.
[12:00.500 --> 12:01.740]  502 Bad Gateway?
[12:01.900 --> 12:04.400]  I thought that he skateboarded. Does he play hockey in this?
[12:05.160 --> 12:06.640]  Maybe that's how he gets his start.
[12:08.020 --> 12:09.840]  So wait, he didn't know he was getting drafted?
[12:10.520 --> 12:13.680]  I don't know. Maybe that's why he was watching. He was hoping to get drafted.
[12:13.980 --> 12:14.760]  When did he apply?
[12:14.900 --> 12:15.400]  What is happening?
[12:15.600 --> 12:16.080]  Did he send an application?
[12:17.240 --> 12:18.260]  I bet Louie did.
[12:18.960 --> 12:21.220]  Louie was like, I can't handle this hockey life.
[12:21.380 --> 12:24.500]  I need Jack to go live his dream and stop throwing apples at me.
[12:24.840 --> 12:27.640]  So I'm gonna make him eligible for hockey.
[12:27.740 --> 12:28.700]  What does Cloud mean?
[12:29.440 --> 12:33.660]  Nick is positing that maybe Jack had a career-ending injury, but...
[12:35.460 --> 12:37.720]  But we saw him leave.
[12:40.200 --> 12:41.440]  I like his shoes.
[12:41.640 --> 12:45.860]  I like that the whole point of the last movie was getting back to where he's from, getting back to the preserve.
[12:46.140 --> 12:46.600]  Where he belongs.
[12:46.960 --> 12:50.260]  Yeah, where he belongs, and now it's like, alright, come on back, sequel money.
[12:51.120 --> 12:56.320]  So there's a lot of, I wonder if, similarities to his real-life situation, right?
[12:56.400 --> 12:59.740]  Like the monkey, I don't remember his name now, if it was...
[12:59.740 --> 13:00.400]  Bernie.
[13:01.180 --> 13:01.260]  Bernie.
[13:01.580 --> 13:02.440]  The monkey Bernie.
[13:02.960 --> 13:04.480]  Or rather, the chimpanzee Bernie.
[13:04.740 --> 13:07.920]  He eventually left and went to the, what zoo did Andrew say?
[13:08.040 --> 13:08.340]  Oakland.
[13:08.340 --> 13:08.960]  Oakland Zoo?
[13:09.280 --> 13:16.880]  Do you think that Bernie, the chimpanzee, like, watches TV at the Oakland Zoo and sees his old career go by,
[13:16.940 --> 13:23.520]  as like, acting monkeys, and gets sad, and is like, oh, this is a hard parallel to live with.
[13:23.760 --> 13:26.120]  And his agent keeps calling, he's like, go back.
[13:26.220 --> 13:26.820]  He's like, no.
[13:27.320 --> 13:28.080]  I can't do it.
[13:28.420 --> 13:28.880]  I can't.
[13:28.880 --> 13:29.440]  I can't.
[13:31.340 --> 13:33.840]  Oh, Andrew, you missed it, he just got drafted.
[13:34.580 --> 13:35.560]  To the ZHL.
[13:36.220 --> 13:36.500]  Hello?
[13:36.900 --> 13:37.540]  Where did you go?
[13:37.900 --> 13:38.880]  Why did you leave?
[13:39.360 --> 13:46.740]  I didn't, I, I heard Geoff say, isn't it weird that Andrew isn't talking, and I had never stopped talking the entire time.
[13:47.280 --> 13:48.320]  Oh, yeah, we never heard you.
[13:48.320 --> 13:49.660]  You just thought we were talking over you?
[13:50.200 --> 13:55.480]  No, I was talking in between both of you, and it just flowed, it still made sense.
[13:55.500 --> 13:56.000]  It did not flow.
[13:56.400 --> 13:57.400]  There was no talking.
[13:58.380 --> 14:04.760]  From my perspective, everything was like, flowing fine, and like, we're all going back and forth, and like, it just coincidentally lined up.
[14:05.380 --> 14:07.200]  I'm hopping back into the, what's happening?
[14:07.680 --> 14:10.140]  What do you mean, he got, he just got drafted to the ZHL?
[14:10.780 --> 14:15.500]  You've, you've told us this is a movie about monkey skateboarding, but he's only, it's just been a hockey movie.
[14:15.780 --> 14:16.820]  Yeah, it's pretty hockey heavy.
[14:17.280 --> 14:19.900]  I don't know what I watched, because this is...
[14:21.620 --> 14:23.180]  I don't remember him being drafted.
[14:24.480 --> 14:25.380]  He got drafted by this guy.
[14:25.380 --> 14:29.900]  He didn't, he didn't even know he had made himself eligible for the draft.
[14:30.500 --> 14:32.180]  Was he a first round pick? Where did he go?
[14:32.580 --> 14:34.320]  Oh no, he was like in the 11th round.
[14:35.120 --> 14:35.980]  That's insane.
[14:36.240 --> 14:36.440]  Yeah.
[14:36.980 --> 14:37.420]  Well...
[14:37.420 --> 14:39.340]  He got drafted to the Seattle Simeons.
[14:39.760 --> 14:43.020]  There hasn't been a lot of clarity on that career-ending injury yet, so who knows?
[14:43.060 --> 14:43.360]  That's true.
[14:45.900 --> 14:47.320]  They don't even know about him?
[14:51.250 --> 14:52.790]  No, I think the goalie does.
[14:53.810 --> 14:57.730]  The guy at the nose ring, or the same actor playing a different role?
[14:58.010 --> 14:59.350]  Which appears to be the case.
[15:01.690 --> 15:05.790]  That suggests he's more, he's like a human and a half, that doesn't make any sense.
[15:06.190 --> 15:06.930]  Well, it's Gretzky.
[15:07.610 --> 15:08.410]  Gretzky was 99.
[15:08.710 --> 15:11.670]  Yeah, so he's half of, he's slightly better than Gretzky.
[15:11.670 --> 15:14.990]  One half, one half, one half of one point better than Wayne Gretzky.
[15:18.710 --> 15:19.610]  Oh shit.
[15:19.990 --> 15:20.290]  Wow.
[15:20.990 --> 15:21.730]  That's a dilemma.
[15:21.730 --> 15:23.130]  That sucks for him.
[15:25.210 --> 15:27.710]  You play for the Simeons, you fucking idiot.
[15:27.850 --> 15:28.690]  That's where the Canucks play.
[15:29.290 --> 15:31.510]  I wanna play for the Carjackers.
[15:34.530 --> 15:38.610]  Did you watch a lot of Bruce and Clark Hockey News Hour when you were a kid, Andrew?
[15:39.230 --> 15:40.650]  I would've, if it was available.
[15:41.310 --> 15:42.030]  That was a real thing.
[15:43.050 --> 15:44.770]  Is that, is that the John Adams?
[15:44.770 --> 15:45.230]  Is that Darren?
[15:46.070 --> 15:46.510]  No.
[15:46.890 --> 15:47.130]  Oh.
[15:47.630 --> 15:48.090]  Are you sure?
[15:49.250 --> 15:50.170]  I'm pretty sure.
[15:51.370 --> 15:52.590]  Monkey on the bench.
[15:53.790 --> 15:55.910]  These movies were made less than a year apart.
[15:56.110 --> 15:57.590]  I bet they never even stopped production.
[15:57.770 --> 16:00.610]  They just like gave everybody new clothes and just started up with the sequel.
[16:02.490 --> 16:05.090]  They quickly filmed another movie before dropping him back off.
[16:05.330 --> 16:08.770]  They're like, the guy, they're like, Darren's like, what do you want me to be in the new one?
[16:08.790 --> 16:10.310]  They're like, oh, you're actually the AD in this film.
[16:10.370 --> 16:10.970]  You're not in the movie.
[16:18.100 --> 16:19.220]  So he's on the bench.
[16:19.740 --> 16:20.400]  Yeah, he's on the bench.
[16:20.460 --> 16:22.300]  Well, yeah, he's riding all the time in hockey.
[16:24.420 --> 16:25.620]  You have different lines.
[16:28.500 --> 16:30.260]  I don't know why that guy's wearing a headset.
[16:30.460 --> 16:32.880]  I've never seen anyone wear a headset on the bench as coaching.
[16:33.820 --> 16:35.000]  Oh, there you go.
[16:37.860 --> 16:39.460]  What is this guy's voice?
[16:44.140 --> 16:45.820]  Well, I can see the headlines already.
[16:48.200 --> 16:51.040]  This guy is how every fan interprets their owner.
[16:51.040 --> 16:52.820]  Yeah, across like every sport.
[16:57.200 --> 16:58.200]  Oh, shit.
[17:01.950 --> 17:04.130]  These other kids don't give a fuck.
[17:04.570 --> 17:05.650]  Are those his parents?
[17:06.650 --> 17:08.090]  I guess, I don't know.
[17:09.970 --> 17:12.990]  I don't understand how all these people aren't aware of Jack.
[17:13.170 --> 17:17.470]  It's not like there's a huge market for famous championship winning hockey chimps.
[17:17.970 --> 17:19.390]  Oh, that guy's off the ice.
[17:19.830 --> 17:20.990]  And you're on a monkey team.
[17:21.470 --> 17:22.610]  Yeah, you're on the Simians.
[17:30.790 --> 17:31.310]  Yeah.
[17:31.590 --> 17:32.110]  Yeah.
[17:36.950 --> 17:40.650]  Okay, so it is a hockey movie, Andrew?
[17:41.570 --> 17:42.090]  No.
[17:43.810 --> 17:46.330]  It's very possible we're watching the wrong movie.
[17:46.850 --> 17:47.550]  No, this is...
[17:48.130 --> 17:51.250]  Why don't we find out that Andrew has never seen MVP 2 before?
[17:52.170 --> 17:52.690]  No.
[17:53.790 --> 17:56.290]  I don't remember there being this much hockey in it.
[17:57.150 --> 17:58.810]  But look, he scored immediately.
[17:59.130 --> 17:59.310]  Yeah.
[17:59.950 --> 18:01.310]  Well, it was an assist.
[18:01.610 --> 18:03.870]  Oh, now his brother wants to play hockey.
[18:12.560 --> 18:15.160]  No shit, he won a championship.
[18:22.860 --> 18:23.900]  Very convincing.
[18:27.020 --> 18:29.460]  This monkey's pretty good at skating.
[18:30.200 --> 18:31.400]  Yeah, he's not bad.
[18:33.380 --> 18:34.600]  Better than I ever was.
[18:34.600 --> 18:35.440]  I...
[18:36.420 --> 18:38.740]  I just don't know why...
[18:38.740 --> 18:41.880]  Like, this is the right movie because Bob Burnquist is in it.
[18:41.940 --> 18:43.100]  It was in the...
[18:43.100 --> 18:43.300]  Credit.
[18:43.700 --> 18:48.440]  The thing is, they're doing so much work to explain these minor characters.
[18:48.680 --> 18:53.120]  Like, everyone gets a shine, but, like, we're gonna watch him skateboard.
[18:53.940 --> 18:54.460]  Yeah.
[18:55.240 --> 18:56.100]  Oh, no.
[18:57.660 --> 18:59.580]  Oh, he's gonna rip this guy's balls off.
[18:59.680 --> 19:00.200]  Yeah, he is.
[19:01.440 --> 19:03.560]  You know how strong a chimpanzee is?
[19:05.120 --> 19:05.980]  There's Hot Dog.
[19:13.990 --> 19:15.290]  What is this guy?
[19:16.090 --> 19:16.670]  I don't know.
[19:18.530 --> 19:20.410]  Oh, shit, through the legs.
[19:22.170 --> 19:24.690]  I wonder if that's ever happened in the NHL.
[19:27.310 --> 19:28.690]  I like the puck, Cam.
[19:29.150 --> 19:29.430]  It was a nice touch.
[19:29.430 --> 19:31.390]  They just keep reusing the same celebration.
[19:31.850 --> 19:32.390]  Him in the corner.
[19:34.310 --> 19:35.450]  Look at all these women he's got.
[19:37.510 --> 19:38.230]  I hate...
[19:45.570 --> 19:46.690]  It's my favorite character.
[19:48.130 --> 19:50.850]  My drill sergeant used to hit us in the head like that in basic training,
[19:51.010 --> 19:53.630]  but he had a big metal stop sign that he would whack you with.
[19:58.860 --> 19:59.220]  What?
[20:03.360 --> 20:06.080]  I think the worst part of this is that the odor was correct.
[20:07.420 --> 20:07.780]  What?
[20:08.120 --> 20:08.560]  Like, it was...
[20:13.140 --> 20:14.420]  He's Seattle's newest hero.
[20:15.620 --> 20:16.660]  So this takes place in Seattle.
[20:16.880 --> 20:19.920]  I wonder, my daughter is the world's biggest Grey's Anatomy fan.
[20:20.320 --> 20:21.900]  And she was watching the...
[20:21.900 --> 20:26.020]  She was explaining to me how, I don't know, all 19 seasons of it today in the car.
[20:26.120 --> 20:28.100]  I wonder if they exist in the same universe in Seattle.
[20:29.360 --> 20:29.620]  It's possible.
[20:29.620 --> 20:31.860]  Are you allowed to stand on the goal in ice hockey?
[20:32.360 --> 20:32.660]  No.
[20:32.980 --> 20:33.360]  No.
[20:35.000 --> 20:36.120]  I mean, he's just cheating.
[20:38.080 --> 20:39.180]  High five, yeah.
[20:39.180 --> 20:40.880]  Same as Hammer the Storm.
[20:44.890 --> 20:46.680]  I like these bootleg Philly jerseys.
[20:51.650 --> 20:52.650]  I don't...
[20:52.650 --> 20:54.730]  It's the same pose once again.
[20:56.030 --> 20:57.430]  He does it again.
[20:59.150 --> 21:00.150]  What the...
[21:00.150 --> 21:01.050]  A bit grooming.
[21:01.290 --> 21:02.490]  He's a great teammate.
[21:03.090 --> 21:04.290]  Get the bugs out of the back hair.
[21:04.870 --> 21:06.390]  That looks like you without a shirt on, Gav.
[21:12.310 --> 21:12.870]  Aww.
[21:31.880 --> 21:33.120]  They're on the same team.
[21:33.540 --> 21:33.900]  Like, I don't...
[21:36.760 --> 21:37.680]  Si vous plaît.
[21:38.160 --> 21:41.040]  Nobody interviews, like, somebody on the Lakers.
[21:41.300 --> 21:43.140]  It's like, were you just chumped by LeBron James?
[21:43.300 --> 21:44.460]  Like, that's not how this works.
[21:44.780 --> 21:46.540]  We're all collectively trying to win.
[21:46.720 --> 21:48.600]  Does he have seven milkshakes?
[21:48.880 --> 21:49.920]  Oh, he absolutely does.
[21:51.620 --> 21:52.620]  Double milkshake.
[21:53.040 --> 21:54.400]  And he's lactose intolerant.
[22:07.680 --> 22:08.220]  Yeah.
[22:08.220 --> 22:08.980]  Where are their parents?
[22:17.970 --> 22:19.050]  I like...
[22:19.050 --> 22:20.030]  I like...
[22:20.610 --> 22:21.150]  Adult...
[22:21.150 --> 22:21.690]  Like...
[22:22.310 --> 22:23.390]  Childish activities.
[22:24.250 --> 22:24.790]  Yeah.
[22:24.890 --> 22:26.650]  In, like, an adult kind of setting.
[22:27.090 --> 22:28.850]  Like, they're playing poker or something.
[22:28.950 --> 22:31.510]  But it's Go Fish because it's the only thing you understand at 10.
[22:31.870 --> 22:32.270]  Yeah.
[22:32.950 --> 22:35.410]  And he had seven milkshakes making a double.
[22:35.410 --> 22:37.010]  It's all just very, like...
[22:37.010 --> 22:37.830]  It's cute.
[22:39.170 --> 22:42.050]  I feel confident to say at this point, this is just a great movie.
[22:42.730 --> 22:43.610]  It's fantastic.
[22:44.210 --> 22:46.370]  So, you just re-watched MVP.
[22:46.690 --> 22:47.410]  How does this compare?
[22:47.550 --> 22:48.350]  Do you think it's better so far?
[22:48.350 --> 22:49.370]  This is way better.
[22:49.830 --> 22:51.830]  This is so much better than the first one.
[22:52.370 --> 22:54.570]  How much footage of this monkey skin did they get?
[22:54.690 --> 22:57.210]  How many times did they make this chimp do that?
[22:57.670 --> 22:58.790]  Well, it's the card jackets.
[22:58.870 --> 23:00.870]  It's probably the same shoot, I'd assume.
[23:02.030 --> 23:03.250]  This is the exact same team.
[23:03.250 --> 23:07.210]  This is one of those hockey leagues where they only play one other team all season.
[23:07.610 --> 23:08.610]  Is that accurate, by the way?
[23:08.630 --> 23:11.510]  Do the cheerleaders have to stand on the steps because there's no way for them to stand?
[23:12.490 --> 23:12.890]  No.
[23:13.210 --> 23:16.530]  They typically have their own zone, but most teams don't have cheerleaders anymore.
[23:20.540 --> 23:21.880]  Oh, he's a dad, though.
[23:24.240 --> 23:28.100]  Having a midlife crisis because he's dropped down the depth chart due to a monkey.
[23:32.680 --> 23:36.800]  Oh, but he sees that Jack has a family, too.
[23:40.060 --> 23:46.120]  I mean, if he hatched a plot to deliver Jack back to where he's from, he would actually be the hero of the movie.
[23:46.340 --> 23:46.580]  He would.
[23:49.520 --> 23:52.860]  Don't be a bad guy. Be a good guy. Be a good guy.
[24:13.080 --> 24:15.200]  I want to know what other movies this guy has done.
[24:17.540 --> 24:18.640]  I'm on it.
[24:20.860 --> 24:23.420]  Oliver was in MVP, too.
[24:26.340 --> 24:27.400]  Do you want to go for some milkshakes?
[24:30.060 --> 24:30.720]  You're right.
[24:30.860 --> 24:32.000]  Oh, wow. You were right, Gavin.
[24:32.420 --> 24:33.460]  Oh, my God.
[24:35.880 --> 24:38.360]  Are they wearing identical leather jackets?
[24:38.820 --> 24:39.680]  No, slight differences.
[24:49.570 --> 24:53.330]  So why is he so pissed off about playing with a monkey on this team if he's pissed it off?
[24:53.570 --> 24:56.130]  Ian Bagg, the comedian, is in this movie? That's funny.
[25:00.870 --> 25:01.630]  Kids are back.
[25:04.570 --> 25:05.970]  Kids seem really pissed off to me.
[25:10.630 --> 25:14.710]  The guy that plays Rob, Rob Poirier, has been in 90 things.
[25:15.330 --> 25:15.550]  Wow.
[25:15.550 --> 25:20.390]  He is still working. He's in a show called Narco Leap right now, whatever the fuck that is.
[25:20.430 --> 25:22.470]  So much as many things as Mr. Dr. Peabody.
[25:23.470 --> 25:27.290]  He's in a hundred things I've never heard of, so they must all be Canadian, I'm guessing.
[25:28.650 --> 25:36.310]  Oh, the team's clicking. Jack and Poirier are friends. Everything's great.
[25:36.550 --> 25:36.990]  Free bananas.
[25:38.970 --> 25:40.330]  Looks like he's holding his dick.
[25:42.170 --> 25:43.270]  Sorting out a figure skate.
[25:49.120 --> 25:51.940]  Was that a guy in a chimp suit, do you think?
[25:53.340 --> 25:55.860]  I think it was maybe Jack, but sped up.
[25:57.700 --> 25:58.620]  I'm impressed.
[26:09.650 --> 26:11.370]  The extra's going all out.
[26:12.750 --> 26:15.490]  Even the goalie's getting in on it, because why not? Fuck it.
[26:19.470 --> 26:20.570]  Safe shot again.
[26:22.350 --> 26:26.110]  So the goalie has a goal, but that Poirier guy doesn't? Is that what's happening?
[26:26.470 --> 26:28.910]  I think Poirier scored. I think he just came back.
[26:29.070 --> 26:30.890]  I think he's scoring now that they're friends.
[26:32.250 --> 26:33.730]  When do you think he starts skateboarding?
[26:36.370 --> 26:37.610]  I think soon.
[26:38.630 --> 26:40.850]  I'm going to say within the next 10 minutes.
[26:41.310 --> 26:42.110]  We're going to get on a skateboard.
[26:42.210 --> 26:44.810]  El Simeon Nature Preserve and El Simeon El Simeon.
[26:54.240 --> 26:55.840]  What if it's just a box of cash?
[27:00.810 --> 27:02.530]  Another game against the Card Jackers.
[27:04.310 --> 27:06.010]  Another money-saving game.
[27:09.570 --> 27:12.850]  Oh, but he's got a plan. Eric's favorite character has a plan.
[27:21.850 --> 27:22.950]  They're sick of losing.
[27:27.610 --> 27:30.350]  Oh, are they going to send him to skateboarding?
[27:36.680 --> 27:38.400]  This is how I remember the movie opening.
[27:40.660 --> 27:42.120]  We could have just died here.
[27:42.560 --> 27:43.580]  We could have.
[27:45.120 --> 27:45.500]  Oh.
[27:47.100 --> 27:52.780]  Oh, this is like the first movie. The pucks is kind of around the net.
[27:52.860 --> 27:53.680]  Everyone's all tied up.
[27:57.150 --> 27:57.850]  Watch out, Jack.
[27:58.210 --> 27:59.130]  Jack, look out.
[27:59.990 --> 28:01.440]  Oh, my God.
[28:02.390 --> 28:03.210]  Shit.
[28:06.990 --> 28:11.430]  So he's going to say Jack bit him, but it's just ketchup.
[28:14.000 --> 28:15.330]  What's going on?
[28:30.230 --> 28:31.490]  Jack's like, no.
[28:33.330 --> 28:35.870]  Is biting a penalty in hockey?
[28:37.590 --> 28:41.550]  Yeah, it would be a penalty, but you wouldn't get thrown out of the league for it.
[28:41.710 --> 28:45.710]  Are you aware of anybody biting anybody else in the history of the NHL?
[28:45.770 --> 28:49.750]  Yeah, there was Alex Burroughs bit a player while on the Knucks.
[28:50.110 --> 28:50.610]  He got a penalty.
[28:51.270 --> 28:51.950]  They're taunting.
[28:53.150 --> 28:54.110]  Look how well he skates.
[28:54.690 --> 28:57.930]  And not only has it happened in the NHL, Geoff, it happened in this arena.
[28:58.310 --> 28:59.270]  It happened on this rink.
[29:00.350 --> 29:03.130]  So Jack's not the first person to bite somebody in hockey.
[29:03.390 --> 29:05.350]  He predated Burroughs, but yeah.
[29:07.310 --> 29:07.750]  It's happened.
[29:08.310 --> 29:10.470]  I feel like he's paying a heavier penalty than Burroughs probably did.
[29:10.590 --> 29:11.190]  Oh, definitely.
[29:12.230 --> 29:12.830]  Undeniably.
[29:16.820 --> 29:18.120]  Everybody turns on him.
[29:18.780 --> 29:19.460]  He's sad.
[29:19.900 --> 29:21.760]  He was the hero of Seattle.
[29:28.780 --> 29:31.180]  Think about what you're doing, audience.
[29:36.890 --> 29:37.850]  Monkey's an animal.
[29:48.740 --> 29:51.540]  Oh, it's the henchman in the first movie.
[29:51.740 --> 29:53.460]  That's right next to the coach.
[29:53.500 --> 29:55.560]  His assistant coach was the assistant villain.
[29:55.940 --> 29:56.560]  Oh, really?
[29:56.940 --> 29:57.160]  In the first film.
[29:57.880 --> 29:58.440]  Let me see.
[30:00.160 --> 30:01.880]  We'll never see him again.
[30:09.140 --> 30:09.460]  Good.
[30:09.580 --> 30:09.840]  It's good.
[30:15.630 --> 30:16.710]  Jack doesn't want...
[30:18.430 --> 30:19.730]  Jack doesn't want this.
[30:21.230 --> 30:22.050]  He's hurt.
[30:22.990 --> 30:23.830]  Yeah, he's hurt.
[30:24.730 --> 30:26.290]  He's been unfairly maligned.
[30:33.120 --> 30:36.360]  So Jack just leaves and is now homeless.
[30:37.680 --> 30:38.560]  In Seattle.
[30:39.080 --> 30:39.880]  It's Seattle.
[30:44.840 --> 30:47.380]  Looks really comfortable for him to walk in those shoes.
[30:50.000 --> 30:50.440]  Goddamn.
[30:50.960 --> 30:54.320]  The way Jack walks is how I walk in the morning when I get out of bed.
[30:55.400 --> 30:58.080]  My arthritis is fucking in full effect.
[30:58.500 --> 31:00.240]  He walks like the world is covered in Lego.
[31:00.720 --> 31:03.280]  Yeah, that's me walking to take a piss at 6.30 in the morning.
[31:07.220 --> 31:09.360]  I just love that he doesn't go home.
[31:09.680 --> 31:11.700]  He just decides to live in the streets.
[31:12.620 --> 31:13.460]  Well, he's fucking...
[31:13.460 --> 31:15.960]  He's probably a lot of self-loathing going on, you know?
[31:16.000 --> 31:16.960]  And he doesn't quite understand.
[31:17.120 --> 31:17.240]  That's fair.
[31:18.080 --> 31:18.840]  He did something...
[31:18.840 --> 31:21.000]  People think he did something wrong, but he doesn't know what he did wrong
[31:21.000 --> 31:22.200]  because he didn't really bite anybody.
[31:25.200 --> 31:26.000]  This sucks.
[31:30.800 --> 31:33.000]  I want to know where he thinks he's from.
[31:36.060 --> 31:37.480]  What the fuck?
[31:40.100 --> 31:40.540]  BFI.
[31:42.840 --> 31:44.700]  Okay, but that looks really comfy.
[31:45.120 --> 31:45.560]  Yeah, it does.
[31:53.170 --> 31:53.990]  And now...
[31:53.990 --> 31:54.950]  Oh, he just went right by him.
[31:54.950 --> 31:56.270]  Oh, he just passes him.
[31:57.850 --> 32:00.890]  Well, let this be a lesson to anybody watching this film, us included.
[32:01.170 --> 32:04.190]  If you lose a chimpanzee in the city, check the trash cans.
[32:05.210 --> 32:06.290]  Check the dumpsters.
[32:11.050 --> 32:13.190]  A lot of use out of that space needle.
[32:14.050 --> 32:16.010]  Oh, no.
[32:16.330 --> 32:16.790]  Oh, no.
[32:21.650 --> 32:22.310]  Where are they?
[32:22.670 --> 32:23.900]  Yeah, I guess...
[32:28.250 --> 32:30.570]  So they're not actually going to empty the trash can.
[32:30.670 --> 32:31.670]  They're just going to drive down the street.
[32:32.450 --> 32:35.770]  That's the most inefficient trash emptying company in the world.
[32:35.950 --> 32:36.930]  They do them one by one.
[32:40.630 --> 32:41.510]  He's loving it.
[32:41.710 --> 32:43.090]  He's having a great time.
[32:49.890 --> 32:51.930]  The building in the alley is going to be pissed.
[32:57.050 --> 32:58.530]  Here we go.
[32:58.650 --> 32:59.670]  Oh, there's Bob Burnquist.
[33:03.320 --> 33:05.880]  Something else for me to be really good at.
[33:16.340 --> 33:17.520]  Oh, shit!
[33:17.900 --> 33:18.340]  He's back!
[33:21.200 --> 33:21.940]  Shut up.
[33:23.520 --> 33:25.120]  Channeling his Dick Van Dyke.
[33:33.740 --> 33:38.820]  I like this is the second time he's held a wanted poster with Jack on it, but as different characters.
[33:45.870 --> 33:46.970]  Okay, it's a printing.
[33:47.230 --> 33:49.390]  Okay, I was going to say, what is that business?
[33:52.570 --> 33:56.290]  When someone says hot off the presses, I don't expect them to literally mean it.
[33:56.450 --> 33:57.790]  What did that kid go there for?
[33:58.850 --> 33:59.970]  To check in?
[34:00.170 --> 34:00.590]  To hang the...
[34:00.590 --> 34:01.510]  Oh, to hang the reward.
[34:01.850 --> 34:02.650]  He just works there?
[34:02.650 --> 34:03.350]  Yeah.
[34:03.710 --> 34:05.010]  Well, he's homeless, Gavin.
[34:05.110 --> 34:06.510]  You've got to use two pieces of tape.
[34:06.530 --> 34:08.030]  That's not going to stay long.
[34:08.230 --> 34:09.650]  This kid's not going to keep his job.
[34:14.660 --> 34:15.640]  Staples is a good move.
[34:15.840 --> 34:16.420]  Yeah, that's better.
[34:16.500 --> 34:17.560]  More than one, though.
[34:18.020 --> 34:18.580]  This kid.
[34:18.960 --> 34:19.900]  You don't know what he's doing.
[34:24.360 --> 34:25.620]  She looks like she skates.
[34:29.520 --> 34:30.180]  Is that?
[34:30.720 --> 34:32.180]  It's the home improvement guy.
[34:32.380 --> 34:33.100]  It's Richard Karn.
[34:33.260 --> 34:34.100]  It's Richard Karn, right?
[34:34.700 --> 34:35.000]  Yep.
[34:37.600 --> 34:39.880]  Classic skateboard guy, Dick Karn.
[34:52.450 --> 34:54.830]  I like that he even drinks out of a skateboarding coffee mug.
[34:55.150 --> 34:55.610]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[34:55.690 --> 34:56.730]  Give me that World Industries mug.
[34:56.930 --> 34:57.670]  Attention to detail.
[35:11.640 --> 35:12.460]  All over plant.
[35:17.380 --> 35:18.060]  Great acting.
[35:19.240 --> 35:20.680]  Well, I mean, he's a great actor.
[35:28.840 --> 35:29.540]  Hell yeah.
[35:32.980 --> 35:36.260]  Do you feel like they cut to a close-up there because you couldn't stack your arms together?
[35:36.260 --> 35:37.680]  Oh, definitely.
[35:39.480 --> 35:40.380]  I don't even know.
[35:40.700 --> 35:41.900]  Well, I guess, yeah, he could skate.
[35:42.000 --> 35:43.450]  I'd be surprised if he kickflipped.
[35:43.940 --> 35:44.560]  There we go, he's lit.
[35:52.200 --> 35:54.140]  I mean, he seems to know what he's doing.
[35:56.160 --> 35:58.020]  I mean, yeah.
[35:59.700 --> 36:00.720]  More than I ever did.
[36:02.120 --> 36:04.720]  I feel like every kid in the world can skate that well.
[36:05.300 --> 36:06.640]  Is this downtown Seattle?
[36:09.140 --> 36:10.600]  Where does this fit?
[36:10.600 --> 36:12.260]  This is where the kids with families live.
[36:13.740 --> 36:14.620]  Family street.
[36:15.580 --> 36:18.440]  Jack is gonna walk and see a bunch of monkey families doing the same thing.
[36:22.260 --> 36:24.200]  Like grilling bananas in the front yard.
[36:31.080 --> 36:32.720]  I think I had that Quicksilver hoodie.
[36:33.760 --> 36:34.040]  Yeah?
[36:36.380 --> 36:38.000]  I hope you still do.
[36:38.400 --> 36:39.180]  I'll try to find a picture.
[36:39.640 --> 36:40.560]  It'd be an amazing find.
[36:42.600 --> 36:44.960]  I feel like that guy's in a lot of stuff.
[36:45.160 --> 36:46.560]  But always as that character.
[36:46.780 --> 36:47.640]  As Seattle's finest.
[36:48.240 --> 36:56.030]  Yeah, he looks like he would have stopped Macaulay Culkin at some point.
[36:56.930 --> 36:59.050]  He looks like Richard Kind's stunt double.
[36:59.750 --> 37:00.010]  Yeah.
[37:16.040 --> 37:17.440]  He's a big Simians fan.
[37:19.260 --> 37:20.260]  He actually is!
[37:28.230 --> 37:29.310]  So that's an...
[37:30.330 --> 37:30.970]  Oakland?
[37:33.470 --> 37:33.550]  What?
[37:33.910 --> 37:37.530]  Do you think that...
[37:39.850 --> 37:42.490]  Where's the Simian animal preserve at?
[37:42.890 --> 37:45.550]  I think it's supposed to be in San Francisco.
[37:46.910 --> 37:48.950]  So I was close when I said Oakland.
[37:49.210 --> 37:53.350]  No, you confused a thing from a movie with a real life thing.
[37:54.830 --> 38:00.310]  Well, I'm just saying, the Simian animal sanctuary is supposed to be in Oakland or wherever, but it doesn't look like it.
[38:00.370 --> 38:00.950]  I don't know.
[38:01.570 --> 38:02.910]  I'm just wondering where they filmed it.
[38:04.190 --> 38:05.330]  Wait, it's supposed to be in Oakland?
[38:05.730 --> 38:06.770]  I don't think it is.
[38:07.070 --> 38:11.510]  In the first movie, they mentioned it was in San Francisco or Oakland. I remember that.
[38:12.810 --> 38:14.450]  I paid attention to the presentation.
[38:15.190 --> 38:16.630]  I don't think that was in the presentation.
[38:16.890 --> 38:19.030]  I thought you were saying that the real monkey went to Oakland.
[38:19.430 --> 38:19.790]  Yes.
[38:20.730 --> 38:22.470]  Oh, yeah. The real monkey went to Oakland.
[38:22.470 --> 38:23.990]  The real monkey ended up in Oakland.
[38:25.850 --> 38:26.970]  That's the confusion.
[38:28.250 --> 38:31.270]  I still think I'm supposed to believe that that place is somewhere in California.
[38:32.210 --> 38:33.210]  Apparently San Francisco.
[38:38.020 --> 38:39.280]  Is that Aaron Carter?
[38:41.780 --> 38:42.660]  Or Ryan...
[38:44.320 --> 38:46.260]  What's the name of that young skateboarder? Sheckler?
[38:46.820 --> 38:47.300]  Ryan Sheckler?
[38:47.320 --> 38:49.100]  Is that Ryan Sheckler?
[38:49.440 --> 38:50.960]  I doubt it. Let's see.
[38:51.060 --> 38:52.640]  I think it might be young Ryan Sheckler.
[38:53.400 --> 38:54.400]  Oh, it's a monkey board.
[38:55.800 --> 38:57.160]  Oh, I know this song.
[38:59.100 --> 39:01.060]  This is a band called Death on Wednesday.
[39:03.740 --> 39:04.660]  It's a 90s...
[39:05.580 --> 39:06.540]  I think that's Sheckler.
[39:06.800 --> 39:08.300]  Epitaph or Fat Records punk band.
[39:13.060 --> 39:13.500]  Airquake?
[39:15.080 --> 39:16.880]  That's actually a pretty good song.
[39:22.650 --> 39:25.470]  I think that kid is a professional skateboarder.
[39:28.020 --> 39:28.700]  I'm looking...
[39:28.700 --> 39:29.320]  I think that's Sheckler.
[39:30.500 --> 39:32.600]  So what's the deal this guy's trying to make with this kid?
[39:32.600 --> 39:34.580]  He's going to give it to him if something happens?
[39:36.120 --> 39:41.200]  I think he knows this kid can't afford a skateboard thing,
[39:41.300 --> 39:44.040]  so he's just going to put this thing in the dumpster and the kid can have it.
[39:54.670 --> 39:56.350]  That's probably a cameo.
[39:56.870 --> 39:58.350]  It's like Chad Muska or something.
[39:59.250 --> 40:00.290]  He's uncredited.
[40:01.390 --> 40:04.570]  I'm looking at a skateboarding appearance.
[40:05.570 --> 40:09.430]  Tyler Vence, Jordan Hoffit, Nathan Lacoste, and Rob Boyce.
[40:10.430 --> 40:12.110]  I don't see any...
[40:12.790 --> 40:15.070]  Well, Burnquist is in this, so you'd think...
[40:15.070 --> 40:16.830]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's listed as Burnquist, though.
[40:25.710 --> 40:27.370]  The squeak in the shoe always gets me.
[40:28.690 --> 40:32.270]  Kid number one at Skateboard Place, Danny Hag or Hague.
[40:33.270 --> 40:34.590]  Huh, okay.
[40:40.910 --> 40:42.650]  Oh, oh, oh.
[40:43.370 --> 40:44.050]  Never mind.
[40:44.910 --> 40:46.650]  Neil Nellis, Ryan Sheckler.
[40:47.110 --> 40:47.630]  There you go.
[40:47.710 --> 40:48.670]  I was going to say.
[40:48.710 --> 40:49.370]  He just had a name.
[40:49.370 --> 40:51.830]  That character has a name, I guess, so we'll see him again.
[40:52.230 --> 40:53.050]  Yeah, Ryan Sheckler.
[40:54.110 --> 40:55.430]  Is this a lifeguarding movie?
[40:57.770 --> 41:01.490]  I think the thing to learn about this is chimpanzees are multifaceted.
[41:02.270 --> 41:04.150]  And they can't be put into a box.
[41:04.630 --> 41:06.370]  Unless that box is a dumpster.
[41:11.890 --> 41:13.390]  So Allie doesn't meet my status.
[41:13.710 --> 41:14.790]  That's me in five years.
[41:29.850 --> 41:31.030]  That's where he lives.
[41:32.430 --> 41:34.230]  Richard Kine's name is Allie.
[41:36.810 --> 41:38.510]  Yeah, his name's Oliver Plant.
[41:38.710 --> 41:39.610]  Allie Plant, yeah.
[41:39.750 --> 41:41.750]  I think it's supposed to be two, like...
[41:41.750 --> 41:42.570]  Skateboarding references.
[41:42.770 --> 41:43.110]  Yeah.
[41:47.310 --> 41:49.910]  Oh, a little frickin' tech deck thing.
[41:51.230 --> 41:52.250]  Those were great.
[41:52.590 --> 41:53.590]  I love those.
[41:54.210 --> 41:56.610]  I didn't like the feel of the grip on my fingertips.
[41:57.290 --> 41:57.690]  Really?
[41:57.990 --> 41:58.290]  Yeah.
[42:01.200 --> 42:02.820]  Were you ever able to do a trick with that?
[42:02.820 --> 42:03.720]  Nah, it was dog shit.
[42:04.120 --> 42:05.440]  Yeah, it was terrible, too.
[42:08.780 --> 42:09.200]  Aww.
[42:10.120 --> 42:10.780]  That's his mom.
[42:12.440 --> 42:13.400]  That's his Louie.
[42:14.160 --> 42:15.400]  That is his Louie.
[42:21.010 --> 42:22.310]  Who's paying the electricity bill?
[42:24.930 --> 42:27.230]  I'm glad you're here to ask the hard-hitting questions.
[42:27.770 --> 42:30.250]  Oh, dude, Louie's... the monkey Louie...
[42:30.250 --> 42:32.570]  Oh, sorry, the chimpanzee Louie was played by Louie.
[42:33.550 --> 42:33.990]  Oh.
[42:34.510 --> 42:35.090]  Checks out.
[42:35.350 --> 42:35.790]  As himself.
[42:36.170 --> 42:36.930]  Yeah, he played by himself.
[42:37.830 --> 42:38.550]  Different Louie, though.
[42:40.150 --> 42:40.890]  Once again.
[42:42.630 --> 42:43.190]  Space needle.
[42:43.850 --> 42:47.070]  I can't believe the first half an hour of this skateboarding movie was about hockey.
[42:48.910 --> 42:51.570]  Well, we had to tie up some loose ends from the first movie.
[42:53.350 --> 42:54.690]  Had to show him getting drafted.
[42:55.010 --> 42:59.710]  That's what I like about these movies, is they focus in on the details that don't matter at all.
[43:00.510 --> 43:01.910]  They really invest in them.
[43:03.090 --> 43:06.790]  Much like MVP1, he wakes up to discover a sport that he likes.
[43:07.350 --> 43:09.670]  I don't know if he likes skateboarding yet, I guess.
[43:09.910 --> 43:10.470]  We haven't seen that.
[43:10.890 --> 43:16.770]  You can always tell in a cheap movie a set that's been painted for the movie, and that is what we are looking at here.
[43:17.050 --> 43:18.990]  You weren't buying the muck on that pool?
[43:19.130 --> 43:21.410]  No, I'm not buying the muck. I'm not buying the walls.
[43:30.310 --> 43:30.710]  Fucking...
[43:30.710 --> 43:32.050]  Jack wears Etnies.
[43:32.970 --> 43:33.510]  I love it.
[43:37.290 --> 43:38.010]  Jack improves.
[43:43.260 --> 43:47.400]  You feel like the kid bails and then Jack gets the skateboard? How is he going to get on this board?
[43:49.320 --> 43:51.580]  Yeah, he's going to have to stack it somewhere, isn't he?
[44:09.060 --> 44:12.140]  I gotta say, I don't know how anybody could think Jack could bite anyone.
[44:12.300 --> 44:16.000]  That monkey has the... sorry, that chimpanzee has the kindest face.
[44:16.820 --> 44:20.600]  Yeah, but I think they do constantly bite people and rip people's penises off.
[44:20.600 --> 44:23.300]  In real life, yeah. This isn't real life.
[44:24.280 --> 44:25.820]  This is movie Seattle.
[44:27.100 --> 44:29.180]  It's a totally different magical world.
[44:30.140 --> 44:33.260]  What if this kid also had a connection to a hepatitis lab?
[44:33.480 --> 44:37.400]  Yeah, it's a magical world where this kid is on the streets and not on heroin.
[44:39.580 --> 44:41.740]  And everyone's chugging milkshake.
[44:42.020 --> 44:42.240]  Yeah.
[44:55.900 --> 44:57.040]  Now, Andrew...
[44:57.040 --> 44:57.440]  Is he stealing the food?
[44:57.760 --> 44:58.120]  Yes.
[44:58.760 --> 45:04.980]  You saw this movie and you were inspired to learn how to skateboard because of Jack.
[45:05.500 --> 45:08.400]  Was it because you thought if the monkey did it, I could do it?
[45:08.460 --> 45:13.500]  Or was it because you thought if I learned how to skateboard, I could get a monkey friend who will come and skateboard with me?
[45:13.500 --> 45:13.860]  No.
[45:14.520 --> 45:19.000]  So I think we're going to see, I assume, within this scene, why I believe that I could instantly skateboard.
[45:19.780 --> 45:22.560]  I like the idea of learning to skateboard to get the monkeys.
[45:24.200 --> 45:25.400]  This is how I'm going to get a friend.
[45:26.020 --> 45:26.820]  Step one!
[45:28.120 --> 45:29.020]  Buy a skateboard.
[45:29.180 --> 45:30.980]  That was the smallest bite of a banana I've ever seen.
[45:32.920 --> 45:34.980]  I feel you're qualified to make that judgment, too.
[45:35.120 --> 45:35.400]  Thank you.
[45:35.480 --> 45:36.380]  I've eaten a few.
[45:37.180 --> 45:38.460]  Bananas I can eat right now, they're soft.
[45:40.120 --> 45:44.080]  So see, Jack is like, I don't know, I'm going to lick this wheel. I don't even know what this is.
[45:49.690 --> 45:50.470]  He's like, sure.
[45:50.850 --> 45:53.290]  Fucking throw your boards to the...
[45:56.940 --> 45:59.480]  It's so impressive and so sad at the same time.
[45:59.760 --> 45:59.960]  Yeah.
[46:00.920 --> 46:02.980]  It was at this moment I thought I could skateboard.
[46:09.190 --> 46:13.150]  I always wanted to teach Henry how to ride a skateboard, but Emily was not having it.
[46:14.550 --> 46:15.470]  That would have been great.
[46:17.370 --> 46:19.850]  I think you got to start young with that kind of stuff.
[46:20.070 --> 46:21.030]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[46:21.730 --> 46:23.330]  I was always annoyed that I couldn't skateboard.
[46:24.530 --> 46:24.890]  Really?
[46:25.170 --> 46:25.450]  Yeah.
[46:25.770 --> 46:27.670]  I was always annoyed I couldn't skateboard better.
[46:28.890 --> 46:35.270]  Like, what they're doing now on that, like, if you said go down that ramp and end up at the bottom of that pool on it, I could not do it.
[46:35.390 --> 46:37.650]  If I offered you a thousand dollars, you couldn't do it.
[46:37.650 --> 46:38.710]  I couldn't do it.
[46:39.370 --> 46:42.810]  I can teach you how to do it in five minutes. There's nothing hard about that.
[46:43.730 --> 46:48.550]  I'm just immediately going to Gavin on does it do, falling, trying to push you, Geoff.
[46:48.610 --> 46:52.330]  You saw me trying to run with sticky shoes on.
[46:53.170 --> 46:55.730]  Yeah, you with wheels I guess is not...
[46:55.730 --> 46:59.490]  I'll be honest with you, you don't look comfortable on a bicycle either.
[47:00.870 --> 47:01.950]  Now that I think about it.
[47:02.030 --> 47:04.290]  Well, the freaking brakes are the wrong way around for a start.
[47:05.850 --> 47:07.390]  Are we breaking in? What are we doing?
[47:07.650 --> 47:11.270]  Oh, the garbage. The Ollie's. Back at Ollie's.
[47:22.010 --> 47:31.430]  Can you imagine being thrown into the streets because somebody thinks that you bit someone, but needing to be, like, morally clear that they're not stealing? Like, it's the same.
[47:34.870 --> 47:39.810]  So did he walk out of the ice hockey place, like, ten seconds before they check that guy's hand?
[47:41.430 --> 47:47.210]  I get, yeah, like, what investigation are they doing? Because it was ketchup. There's not... it wasn't the deepest move.
[47:50.800 --> 47:53.200]  Are we buying this guy's hair? Is that real?
[47:57.320 --> 48:05.560]  So that's a good question. This came out in 2001, right? So what was he doing in his career at that moment?
[48:05.680 --> 48:09.500]  Probably family feud, or this is probably right before he was doing family feud, right?
[48:09.960 --> 48:11.760]  Oh, he did? Yeah, I forgot about that.
[48:12.560 --> 48:14.960]  Thousand. He was...
[48:14.960 --> 48:16.400]  When did home improvement end?
[48:16.400 --> 48:22.660]  Oh, you know what? He was also in Air Bud's seventh inning fetch, so he might be all over this world.
[48:22.940 --> 48:25.380]  Dude, this director's loyal to his cast.
[48:27.480 --> 48:31.820]  Home Improvement was on from 91 to 99, so this was his follow-up to Home Improvement.
[48:33.780 --> 48:37.640]  He was in... yeah, yeah. Dang.
[48:37.980 --> 48:40.700]  Is that Gatorade? What is that? I wonder what that feels like.
[48:40.840 --> 48:43.700]  It is Gatorade. I've never seen a Gatorade bottle look like that.
[48:43.700 --> 48:45.700]  I wonder what it feels like to film...
[48:47.240 --> 48:55.620]  nine years of a major television show, one of the most successful comedies on TV for the nine years it was on,
[48:55.760 --> 48:59.500]  and then to follow it up with a straight-to-video monkey skateboard movie.
[49:04.680 --> 49:06.220]  Man, fuck entertainment.
[49:15.160 --> 49:17.060]  Oh, he was also in Snow Buddies.
[49:19.400 --> 49:21.940]  And Air Buddies. Goddamn, Richard Cordas.
[49:21.960 --> 49:23.900]  Same character? Or is it different?
[49:25.200 --> 49:27.100]  Different characters, I think. Okay.
[49:27.160 --> 49:29.060]  He's all over the place with the animals.
[49:30.340 --> 49:32.700]  These chips are honestly incredible. It's mind-blowing.
[49:33.340 --> 49:33.540]  Yeah.
[49:35.220 --> 49:36.580]  Hey, look, the Space Needle.
[49:37.440 --> 49:40.540]  It's making a fucking Space Needle drinking game movie.
[49:49.460 --> 49:50.360]  Yupper-dupper.
[49:50.720 --> 49:52.160]  Louis also wears Etnies.
[49:52.160 --> 49:52.300]  Etnies.
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.360]  I'd love to know what that guy's voice actually sounds like.
[50:09.620 --> 50:12.420]  Do you think British chimps take their shoes off in the house?
[50:17.330 --> 50:21.050]  Do you think if British chimps come in from the rain, they put their stuff in the warming closet?
[50:31.240 --> 50:34.880]  That kid has no idea what he's doing or why he's there.
[50:35.600 --> 50:39.920]  I mean, I think you could ask that kid if he remembers working on this movie, and he would say no.
[50:40.020 --> 50:44.160]  The disappointment on that kid's face is generally because he didn't get to have a scene with the chimp.
[50:59.280 --> 51:00.860]  Louis is having none of this bullshit.
[51:02.860 --> 51:03.300]  Awesome.
[51:05.480 --> 51:09.220]  I like his little duck jacket. This is great.
[51:09.800 --> 51:11.200]  His little wellies.
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.780]  The monkey can spell, but just not well.
[51:15.780 --> 51:17.940]  It's Ned from the first movie!
[51:21.160 --> 51:22.540]  That's actually where he lived.
[51:26.200 --> 51:27.700]  That guy's not alive, right?
[51:27.900 --> 51:30.300]  He just drives that truck from movie set to movie set.
[51:31.080 --> 51:32.820]  Like, y'all need an old guy?
[51:33.940 --> 51:36.080]  He's actually on the way to old school right now.
[51:39.160 --> 51:41.620]  He's like, I just toured the country playing bit parts.
[51:43.120 --> 51:45.620]  He's trying to grab the windshield wiper!
[51:46.360 --> 51:49.480]  You know that wasn't in the script, but it was so cute they left it in.
[51:50.360 --> 51:55.300]  I don't think that actor knows he's in a movie. I think they performed him later.
[51:57.340 --> 51:58.420]  Pretty good bowls.
[51:58.960 --> 51:59.960]  Why are they getting this fresh milk?
[52:01.640 --> 52:02.780]  Is that dumpster milk?
[52:04.340 --> 52:06.980]  They throw good stuff away. It's not stealing.
[52:07.080 --> 52:08.620]  There's no better milk than dumpster milk.
[52:12.260 --> 52:15.220]  Oh, he makes money. He probably bought the milk. He's got a little fridge in there.
[52:16.220 --> 52:17.840]  I forgot, he does the flyer thing.
[52:27.160 --> 52:28.700]  So far, he's not been very vertical.
[52:29.760 --> 52:30.120]  No.
[52:30.620 --> 52:33.920]  I feel like we have seen that alleyway nine different ways.
[52:34.760 --> 52:35.160]  Definitely.
[52:41.650 --> 52:46.470]  You know, Gavin, if you never picked up that high-speed camera from your neighbor...
[52:48.990 --> 52:50.430]  This is who you would be right now.
[52:51.270 --> 52:52.430]  Right now, age 34.
[52:58.060 --> 53:00.360]  I think I could become a scarf guy.
[53:00.880 --> 53:03.060]  Like a wood jumper and scarf man.
[53:03.080 --> 53:05.080]  Oh, I could see you. Yeah, definitely.
[53:06.980 --> 53:07.380]  Inappropriate.
[53:18.790 --> 53:19.190]  Awesome.
[53:20.510 --> 53:22.050]  He's a fucking cool guy.
[53:22.330 --> 53:25.230]  I gotta say, so far, I think this movie is better than the Tuxedo.
[53:25.770 --> 53:27.670]  I think it is a way better movie than the Tuxedo.
[53:29.250 --> 53:30.050]  This alone.
[53:35.000 --> 53:35.940]  Are we about to get vertical?
[53:36.600 --> 53:37.840]  It's about to become vertical.
[53:38.360 --> 53:39.580]  I think we're about to become vertical.
[53:42.780 --> 53:44.730]  I love this fucking soundtrack.
[53:47.840 --> 53:48.420]  Jesus!
[53:50.260 --> 53:53.520]  I remember being so excited watching this as a kid.
[53:54.060 --> 53:55.800]  Like, I legitimately couldn't do any of this.
[53:56.400 --> 53:58.520]  Oh, no. I learned I couldn't.
[54:00.060 --> 54:03.260]  Are the shoes, like, drilled into the skateboard?
[54:03.840 --> 54:04.600]  Yes, they are.
[54:07.800 --> 54:08.860]  This is crazy.
[54:09.180 --> 54:10.180]  This is Death on Wednesday again.
[54:19.620 --> 54:21.220]  This is so good.
[54:22.920 --> 54:24.040]  He hit the camera there.
[54:24.360 --> 54:28.700]  I'm gonna buy everybody a copy of this album so you can all take MVP2 with you wherever you go.
[54:29.780 --> 54:30.640]  Sounds great.
[54:35.720 --> 54:38.720]  I like to imagine the camera guy also on a skateboard.
[54:39.520 --> 54:42.700]  This must look so funny from a behind-the-scenes perspective.
[54:44.640 --> 54:45.700]  He did that.
[54:46.360 --> 54:47.120]  He did that.
[54:47.420 --> 54:50.480]  And they're not even, like, pulling it on string. He's, like, doing this.
[54:54.240 --> 54:56.760]  Dude, he fucking looked back like a cool-ass monkey right there.
[55:01.550 --> 55:05.550]  See, this is him after, like, one day of practice. I was like, oh, I got this.
[55:19.710 --> 55:21.450]  That looks so uncomfortable.
[55:22.170 --> 55:32.530]  If you could have... be exactly like you are now, in every way, except you had the equivalent of human monkey hand feet, would you take him?
[55:34.370 --> 55:35.090]  Monkey feet?
[55:35.690 --> 55:38.910]  Yeah, like, he's got, like, he's essentially got hands for feet.
[55:39.430 --> 55:40.750]  Yeah, absolutely.
[55:41.070 --> 55:41.850]  I think I would, too.
[55:48.950 --> 55:50.130]  Why would he care?
[55:52.110 --> 55:53.350]  That was a nice moment.
[55:54.710 --> 55:57.070]  The wrong person ducked.
[55:57.110 --> 55:59.290]  He's like, I gotta lay off the milkshakes.
[56:00.670 --> 56:02.150]  I'm starting to see stuff.
[56:06.600 --> 56:08.700]  Why is there all this skating equipment in this alley?
[56:10.700 --> 56:12.260]  That's how grunge started, Gavin.
[56:14.020 --> 56:15.420]  Like a bolted-down rail?
[56:15.780 --> 56:18.120]  Oh, yeah. It's just like Seattle was just, like, one big skate park.
[56:19.840 --> 56:21.420]  I hope the homeless guy moved.
[56:21.580 --> 56:23.080]  He was annoyed before.
[56:23.260 --> 56:24.580]  What if he moved to this alley?
[56:29.430 --> 56:31.750]  I'm not buying that that kid could reach the fire escape ladder.
[56:37.420 --> 56:44.920]  I really like that he left hockey hurt and is now just continuing to stay in this lifestyle because he's a skate monkey now.
[56:45.060 --> 56:48.600]  Did they make a skating game? Because that would have been awesome.
[56:49.780 --> 56:52.260]  Like, was this chimp ever a character in Tony Hawk or anything?
[56:52.460 --> 56:53.760]  No, that would have been great.
[57:03.390 --> 57:03.950]  Gotta go.
[57:10.220 --> 57:11.160]  I'm sad.
[57:12.380 --> 57:14.840]  This is who we have protecting our streets in America.
[57:21.140 --> 57:23.820]  He's all tuckered out from that half a block.
[57:25.460 --> 57:27.980]  Oh, we're still at Ned and Louie.
[57:47.310 --> 57:49.330]  This is my favorite character.
[58:24.940 --> 58:26.800]  It's okay, ma'am. I'm allowed to break it in.
[58:33.560 --> 58:34.380]  Where's the share?
[58:49.800 --> 58:50.560]  What notes?
[58:53.380 --> 58:54.000]  Oh, no.
[59:01.680 --> 59:02.980]  Padlock still works, huh?
[59:03.400 --> 59:03.580]  Yep.
[59:07.860 --> 59:09.420]  Hit it with his unlocking stick.
[59:22.410 --> 59:24.690]  Oh, that was what I looked like when I tried.
[59:27.330 --> 59:29.550]  I feel like Jack could probably run faster.
[59:29.790 --> 59:37.470]  Has that ever happened to you, Geoff?
[59:38.130 --> 59:39.750]  Have I ever snapped a board in half?
[59:40.130 --> 59:41.270]  Yeah, of course.
[59:42.910 --> 59:44.610]  How long does a skateboard last?
[59:49.590 --> 59:51.730]  It depends on how you skate with it.
[59:52.390 --> 59:53.590]  A skateboard can last forever.
[59:54.250 --> 59:55.890]  If you don't grind stuff?
[59:56.130 --> 01:00:00.290]  If you're grinding and doing rail slides and shit, you're gonna snap it sooner or later.
[01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:09.310]  Also, the longer a skateboard exists, the less pop it has and the more brittle it becomes.
[01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:15.550]  At some point, you just want to trade out a skateboard anyway, because it's past its useful date.
[01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:18.790]  It's expired Best Buy.
[01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:31.850]  See? That's what I told you.
[01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:35.350]  I should have just waited for it.
[01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:44.590]  Man, I'm excited for them to get their little asses down to Airquake, whoever it's called.
[01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:49.130]  Jack's like, fuck you, loser. I'm out.
[01:00:54.490 --> 01:00:55.730]  He walks just like Jack.
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:00.500]  You're not wrong.
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:03.960]  Watching this kid and this monkey walk around like this, it makes me finally feel represented.
[01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:11.410]  I love the way he gets into shit.
[01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:26.890]  Glad they inserted that.
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:31.780]  They actually didn't know they were in a movie.
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:34.460]  It was just a dad and his kid buying a skateboard.
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:39.640]  They were so shocked when they went back the next week and it was just no longer a business.
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:40.800]  Everyone's gone.
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:42.440]  They're like, was I in a fucking movie?
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.140]  Ollie's closed down.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:54.040]  Me too, my career. I was in Home Improvement for nine years.
[01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:16.730]  Do you feel that this guy represents skateboard shop owners, Geoff? In your experience, how accurate of a portrayal?
[01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:17.730]  This is who...
[01:02:18.330 --> 01:02:26.890]  This is going to sound so mean, but Richard Card in this movie is who Major League fan Jack would be in a different career.
[01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:30.710]  This is who I see owning that skateboard shop.
[01:02:31.850 --> 01:02:35.730]  Jack Pattillo with four different decisions made in his life.
[01:02:38.050 --> 01:02:39.310]  I bet he'd be good at it.
[01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:41.510]  Hell yeah, he'd be good at it. Richard Card is good at it.
[01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:49.310]  It's a monkey board.
[01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:54.920]  Did they say thanks or anything?
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:55.800]  Nope.
[01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:57.400]  Sure, I guess.
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:03.440]  Oh, that thing has pop. Look at the pop.
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:03.860]  Oh, that is...
[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:08.720]  That's probably all Ryan Sheckler.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:25.400]  I have a hard time believing that this child went on to make 98 thanks.
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:26.780]  The other actors.
[01:03:35.050 --> 01:03:37.050]  That's the worst reaction I've ever seen.
[01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:41.690]  It's weird.
[01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:43.730]  You got like one toe in each mouse trap.
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:53.660]  They had to bring the fucking World Industries coffee mug over from the skate shop.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.280]  This is creepy.
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:31.740]  His name's Ben?
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:34.280]  Yeah, I was about to say, have we heard his name yet?
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.620]  I was literally about to ask what the kid's name is.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:38.400]  I had no idea.
[01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:07.540]  Ben.
[01:05:11.790 --> 01:05:14.710]  I don't see this... what is this kid's name?
[01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:16.030]  Ben?
[01:05:16.170 --> 01:05:16.470]  Ben.
[01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:21.870]  He's not listed as top cast in the movie. Jesus.
[01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:24.950]  Reporter 2 and 3 are, though.
[01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:25.750]  What the fuck?
[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:33.540]  Ben is Scott Goodman.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.180]  And he... oh.
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:40.020]  He was only in this movie.
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:42.860]  He was in this?
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:46.380]  He was in this and the behind-the-scenes featurette.
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:48.260]  Checks out.
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:53.200]  Probably got a normal... he's probably a similar age to me, got a normal job, except he could say...
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:58.280]  I was the lead role in a monkey movie and that's all I did in the film industry.
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:08.060]  The one piece of trivia for him is, did you know he attends Lakewood High School in Lakewood, California and will be entering his senior year?
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.260]  Still going.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:13.840]  Oh god, the monkey's driving.
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:15.740]  Oh no, Louie's driving now.
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:17.420]  He's 35 now.
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:18.240]  Yeah.
[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.500]  He's probably not still in high school.
[01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:31.590]  Okay.
[01:06:31.850 --> 01:06:32.090]  Drink.
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.340]  Is this Skate Quake Day?
[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:43.380]  I'm so excited for the tournament.
[01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:46.960]  That's like me yesterday.
[01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:58.080]  I don't feel like this is Jack's portrayal of this movie at all.
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.360]  This feels disconnected.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:10.740]  Okay, cut.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:11.960]  Jesus Christ.
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:20.960]  I kind of like that they've ended up in Seattle by mistake.
[01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:23.760]  How is he sitting lower than the chimp?
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:25.880]  Louie was driving.
[01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:31.890]  Oh, carjackers are back.
[01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:37.330]  How are the carjackers in the finals? They lost four fucking games to the simians.
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:47.880]  Andrew, can I ask you a question?
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:48.720]  Yeah, of course.
[01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:53.680]  I don't want to know the answer because I want to be surprised, but do you remember how this whole thing ends?
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.720]  No, I have no idea.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.820]  So it's kind of like watching it for the first time.
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:00.960]  It is, yeah. This is essentially like watching it for the first time. I have no memory of the ending.
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:05.560]  We could be in a situation where Louie becomes a hockey player and Jack keeps skating.
[01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:09.060]  That might be a situation we're about to get into.
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.780]  Yeah, I think we're about to see this.
[01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:15.030]  It doesn't look like Jack though.
[01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.870]  No.
[01:08:17.530 --> 01:08:17.890]  No.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.060]  He looks afraid.
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:29.240]  Do you think Louie is like Lady from the Animal Sanctuary?
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:31.340]  Sorry, all you humans look alike to me.
[01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:44.530]  Oh no.
[01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:51.850]  So was he suspended? What was the review? Was there an investigation? Was there a penalty?
[01:08:53.790 --> 01:08:58.350]  Oh, for God's sake.
[01:08:59.650 --> 01:09:01.810]  He fucking sucks, that's what's wrong.
[01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:04.930]  He hasn't had all the training from the first movie.
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:16.300]  Oh, that's Ian Bagg. Okay.
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:19.120]  The...
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.600]  The blonde dude?
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:21.400]  The Eastern European guy?
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:23.340]  Yeah, he's a stand-up comedian.
[01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:24.320]  Okay.
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:29.720]  He's an enforcer.
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:32.060]  All the Louie on ice scenes are my favorite.
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:36.080]  He threw his gloves down like a real...
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:36.500]  Yep.
[01:09:52.330 --> 01:09:53.430]  He just wants to go.
[01:09:56.210 --> 01:09:57.950]  He wants to eat the ice.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:14.600]  Do you think they had to find a chimp that they hadn't taught skating to?
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:15.240]  Yeah.
[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:16.880]  Or did they have to teach him to be shit?
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:24.820]  I feel like probably teach them to be shit or like just...
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:26.880]  instruct them to not respond.
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:29.180]  Jack's...
[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:30.240]  Louie's gonna kill somebody.
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:37.520]  Yeah...
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:42.760]  In the two-team hockey league they're members of.
[01:10:57.090 --> 01:10:57.710]  Airquake!
[01:10:59.710 --> 01:11:01.350]  That's pretty high up.
[01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:16.460]  Sound effects are so good.
[01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:21.800]  Geoff, did you ever drop in from higher than that?
[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:28.200]  I have never dropped in from higher than like eight feet.
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:29.000]  Okay.
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:32.460]  Did you see what happened when Dan did it?
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:33.900]  I did. He broke his fucking arm.
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:38.540]  And then I watched Tony Hawk make fun of him later on another video.
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:41.140]  Well, to be fair, Dan farted on him.
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.260]  Well, good.
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:47.060]  Tony Hawk was really nice.
[01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:53.100]  Okay.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:16.980]  This guy needs to be playing it like 25% less creepy, I think.
[01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:24.970]  Yeah.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.840]  Is this the same band, Geoff?
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.820]  No, I think this is a band called Junction 18.
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.420]  If I'm... if I'm correct.
[01:12:48.930 --> 01:12:51.130]  I want to know where Red Sunglasses guy is.
[01:12:51.650 --> 01:12:52.310]  Yeah, really.
[01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:57.610]  Oh, that's him. He was the henchman in the first movie.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  Ha ha ha.
[01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:31.910]  Is Jack gonna win a skate competition and then go win a hockey championship in the same episode?
[01:13:32.230 --> 01:13:34.210]  I mean, only one of us would know.
[01:14:03.010 --> 01:14:03.570]  Sheckler.
[01:14:05.930 --> 01:14:06.370]  Oh, yeah.
[01:14:07.570 --> 01:14:09.170]  How old is Ryan Sheckler now?
[01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:11.790]  Well, let's see.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:20.920]  Uh, he is, uh, 32 years old.
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:21.860]  Wow.
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:35.680]  Do you just go until you fall?
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:37.040]  No.
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:46.720]  Ben?
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:48.880]  Johnson?
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.560]  Ha ha ha.
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:59.080]  Jackson Popcorn World. He does not... nothing else exists right now.
[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:08.000]  Man, that was... yeah.
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:14.500]  I love that he doesn't question Jack.
[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:17.920]  Like, just being there. That he's just cool with it. He's just riding out the... yeah.
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:19.220]  They're a package deal.
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:25.080]  I'm not gonna report that this chimp is just existing in this world.
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:32.400]  Better be scared to death, you little homeless nerd.
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:36.360]  Man, I could not do that.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:36.940]  No.
[01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:38.760]  Uh, I could...
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.460]  I couldn't believe that Dan did it.
[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:43.140]  I couldn't do it in my 40s. I can't believe Dan tried it at his age.
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:48.380]  I mean, like, with his level of experience, that's a really... that's a big deal.
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:51.220]  That's like... that's like three or four foot of straight vert down.
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:55.680]  What we didn't show in the video is the 40 minutes of everyone trying to talk him out of doing it.
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:58.040]  Including Tony Hawk.
[01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:03.950]  Oh.
[01:16:05.290 --> 01:16:09.150]  Jack's gonna be like the ice... yeah, he's gonna show him it's okay.
[01:16:12.210 --> 01:16:17.450]  I wonder how much of this movie was subsidized by Etnies, Thrasher, and World Industries.
[01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:24.740]  Don't fall for it, kid. Just because Jack can do it doesn't mean you can.
[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:32.440]  Do you think maybe you would have been a better skater if Jack had believed in you two?
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:33.840]  I think so.
[01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:35.660]  I mean, that was what was missing.
[01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:45.790]  Now we're back to death on Wednesday.
[01:16:45.790 --> 01:16:45.890]  Okay.
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:06.600]  Is this the same song that was playing in the background?
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.280]  Yeah, it's the same Death on Wednesday song over and over again.
[01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:12.500]  Okay, yeah. I'm pretty sure...
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:32.640]  It's pretty vertical.
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:36.840]  Would you say the most vertical?
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:39.080]  No, there was a monkey in a tree earlier that was way more vertical.
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:43.260]  Dude, I'd love to be able to ollie a gap like that.
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.020]  There was no reporter in that shot.
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:15.280]  I love Louie so much.
[01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:19.500]  Yeah, I gotta say, Louie's kind of still in the movie.
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:20.960]  Oh, Louie's great.
[01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:37.110]  This guy's headline's receding between scenes.
[01:18:39.150 --> 01:18:41.030]  Like, can we wrap this movie up fast?
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:58.300]  Bob Burtquist!
[01:18:58.540 --> 01:18:58.720]  Oh.
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:18:59.940]  Hell yeah.
[01:19:03.650 --> 01:19:04.270]  Wow.
[01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:09.210]  It's the shittiest belt I've ever seen.
[01:19:18.850 --> 01:19:19.610]  Neil Nesbitt.
[01:19:19.610 --> 01:19:20.890]  That's Ryan Sheckler.
[01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:21.430]  There you go.
[01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:22.110]  There you go, Neil.
[01:19:22.410 --> 01:19:22.830]  Congratulations.
[01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:32.510]  Oh my god!
[01:19:33.710 --> 01:19:35.590]  Now he doesn't have to be homeless anymore.
[01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:37.910]  He won the movie!
[01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:39.590]  Isn't that how movies work?
[01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:44.830]  He got $1,000 and a dad.
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.180]  Thanks, Bob.
[01:20:00.810 --> 01:20:02.490]  Hey everyone, this is my kid that I just met.
[01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:12.320]  What?
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:16.620]  That's not a reason to adopt a child.
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:19.900]  I don't think you get to decide that, son.
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:25.960]  Yeah, I think Jack gets a say as well, right?
[01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:50.250]  This would be such a good Journey for 30.
[01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:53.150]  Do you think ZHL stands for Zamboni Hockey League?
[01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.550]  Yes.
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:01.420]  Get on the skateboard.
[01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:02.180]  It's faster.
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:04.740]  Cut him some slack, dude.
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.060]  He's got arthritis in his lower spine.
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:06.600]  It hurts.
[01:21:10.710 --> 01:21:13.790]  Somebody should sponsor fucking Bob Burtquist for some acting lessons.
[01:21:14.050 --> 01:21:14.370]  Jesus.
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:22.000]  I think this might be Bob Burtquist's only movie as well.
[01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:22.820]  Coincidentally.
[01:21:31.150 --> 01:21:31.550]  Oh.
[01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:34.810]  Now we get to see what a professional skateboarder looks like.
[01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:38.900]  It's so much better.
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:40.340]  What do you mean?
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.240]  It looks the same as when the monkey does it.
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:54.940]  Geoff, could you do that?
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:55.720]  No.
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:22:00.280]  No, but I never really liked vert skating to begin with.
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:01.320]  Yeah.
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:02.780]  There you go, the burn twist.
[01:22:11.610 --> 01:22:13.990]  Hey, I'm really curious about what's happening at the hockey game.
[01:22:14.050 --> 01:22:14.930]  Can we go to that instead?
[01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:19.090]  We need to watch Bob Burtquist do the same trick eight more times.
[01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:27.730]  I wonder if he was offered the game, like the Tony Hawk game, and this at the same time, which he would have viewed as more profitable.
[01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:28.910]  Oh, wow.
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:38.540]  Say more lines.
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:42.840]  Damn.
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:46.720]  Police escort.
[01:22:52.610 --> 01:22:55.230]  So does this cop know about the other chimp?
[01:22:55.450 --> 01:22:55.890]  No.
[01:22:56.510 --> 01:22:58.870]  Well, I guess he's been following the game, so he must.
[01:23:09.190 --> 01:23:10.670]  The scene rules.
[01:23:13.890 --> 01:23:14.370]  Yay!
[01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:16.170]  Louie!
[01:23:17.490 --> 01:23:19.630]  No, you never step on the logo.
[01:23:19.630 --> 01:23:22.050]  Hockey 101, what are they doing?
[01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:33.260]  Wait.
[01:23:45.130 --> 01:23:46.490]  They are?
[01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:50.930]  I wonder how many members of the cast these chimps outlived.
[01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:55.170]  Well, him. Definitely him.
[01:23:56.710 --> 01:24:01.150]  That is a good question. How many people that were involved in this film were dead?
[01:24:05.070 --> 01:24:06.650]  You gotta get Simeon's jerseys.
[01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:09.450]  I mean, it was 21 years ago, right? 22 years ago?
[01:24:21.490 --> 01:24:22.150]  Immediate goal.
[01:24:23.490 --> 01:24:24.650]  Oh, they made it?
[01:24:26.290 --> 01:24:27.030]  Did someone in the crowd just throw a doobie?
[01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:32.950]  I mean, they weren't losing that badly. It looked like it. I noticed that too. I've never seen a blanket at a hockey game.
[01:24:45.570 --> 01:24:46.130]  What?
[01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:51.030]  That guy's dead now.
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:03.740]  I think it was his gum, but...
[01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:30.810]  So this is a hockey movie?
[01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:37.610]  I guess. I think it's hard to argue it's more skateboarding than hockey.
[01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:38.830]  I'd say yeah, it's more horizontal.
[01:25:45.010 --> 01:25:51.590]  Did they feel like they had to make it a hockey movie for it to make sense?
[01:25:52.150 --> 01:25:59.770]  Well, here's the deal. We don't know how this story was written. This might have been planned out from the beginning.
[01:25:59.770 --> 01:26:03.690]  For all we know, it was written as a trilogy and they just never got to make the third movie.
[01:26:10.890 --> 01:26:16.790]  If I was a younger man with more time on my hands, I would write MVP fanfiction.
[01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:20.270]  I would expand the universe. I would tell more stories.
[01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:26.750]  Eric, could you... the guy that wrote this movie has a Twitter thread about the process of making it that's fantastic.
[01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:28.190]  Could you look that up, please?
[01:26:28.190 --> 01:26:28.570]  Are you serious?
[01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:32.150]  Yeah, it's really funny. I don't remember what it was, but it is absurd.
[01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:36.150]  What do I even search for that?
[01:26:36.150 --> 01:26:43.870]  Just look up the IMDB for who wrote it and then maybe search his name in MVP2 thread or something like that. It's great.
[01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:45.510]  I should have pulled that up.
[01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:50.020]  They did it!
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:05.220]  This is more excited than real athletes are when they win the championship. This is fantastic.
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:07.400]  Same celebration.
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:09.400]  Is this a better movie than MVP1?
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:10.580]  Way better.
[01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:13.680]  This might be the best movie I've seen this year.
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:21.140]  Yeah, I would agree with you there. It's a better movie in every way, with a better cast and more cameos, yet it was straight to DVD.
[01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:33.080]  Is he a good comedian?
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:37.840]  I've never seen his stand-up, I've just heard him on podcasts.
[01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:42.420]  He's a pretty funny dude. His name is Ian Bag.
[01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:43.200]  Oh, okay.
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:47.960]  It just looks like the Stanley Cup, that's great.
[01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:52.340]  I want to find out what happened with the investigation.
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:09.080]  None of those guys read hockey, looking at the...
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:09.460]  No.
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:16.120]  Here, I put a... for later, I put a YouTube video in.
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:24.620]  Fucking better.
[01:28:55.890 --> 01:28:57.270]  God, it's so weird.
[01:28:57.410 --> 01:28:58.070]  It's so creepy.
[01:28:59.610 --> 01:29:01.090]  Monkey's not here to protect you now.
[01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:04.870]  Wait, so this guy drove them back?
[01:29:04.990 --> 01:29:05.350]  Yeah.
[01:29:10.210 --> 01:29:10.610]  What?!
[01:29:13.170 --> 01:29:17.010]  I think he just drives right up to their sanctuary. Just let him in.
[01:29:18.110 --> 01:29:20.910]  Just pull it up next to their favorite tree, it won't freak them out at all.
[01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:24.670]  The address... Tree 6, El Simeon, El Simeon.
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:34.540]  Wow.
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:38.300]  What a movie.
[01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:39.220]  Incredible stuff.
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:44.220]  Okay, in comparison to that, Dunstan Checks In is a good, good movie.
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:46.540]  No, that's way better than Dunstan Checks In.
[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:47.160]  Are you serious?
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.520]  No, way, way better.
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:50.660]  Dunstan Checks In is a way better movie than MVP 2.
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:54.940]  And I liked MVP 2, but you are selling Dunstan Checks In short.
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:56.440]  I didn't like it.
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:58.780]  Jason Alexander, incredible in Dunstan.
[01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:00.820]  I don't know.
[01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:02.860]  I feel like...
[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:04.760]  Doorknobs in the middle of the doors, incredible.
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:11.300]  I don't want to get too single-threaded with this whole thing, but I do feel like we need to watch Dunstan now at some point.
[01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:12.900]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:13.880]  I really do.
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:17.900]  So, the thing that Andrew... glad that took nine months to watch.
[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:30.100]  The thing that Andrew asked for, I found the thread of the guy who wrote MVP 2, and I've linked it in our chat.
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:34.980]  He talks a lot about, like, the monkey did his own stunts and he loved doing it, you couldn't smile at the monkey.
[01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:42.500]  The most interesting part, to me, is that this guy didn't know anything about hockey.
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:45.780]  The first MVP is all about hockey, and the plan was the same for the sequel.
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:49.860]  Changing up the main sport happened because I know so little about hockey.
[01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:56.140]  But I was into skate culture as a teen, so I pitched switching hockey to skateboarding to keep the franchise fresh.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:02.140]  I've never written a movie before, so I modeled my script on Pulp Fiction.
[01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:04.720]  What?!
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:06.500]  Oh my god.
[01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:10.940]  They hired a guy to write a sequel to a hockey movie who didn't like hockey and had never written a movie.
[01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:16.240]  Where is the similarity to Pulp Fiction in any way whatsoever?
[01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:26.520]  He modeled it after the runtime. My first draft was 134 pages, which equals 134 minutes.
[01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:30.040]  The director referred to it as War and Peace with chimps.
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:36.120]  Geoff, remember when you were talking about the bowl, like the pool or whatever?
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:42.580]  In the script, I wrote that the orphan kid lives in an abandoned swimming pool that he uses as a skate bowl.
[01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:48.260]  But they couldn't find a pool that worked, so they painted an actual skate bowl to look like an old swimming pool.
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:49.580]  The reverse.
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:51.780]  That was pretty fucking clear there.
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:55.180]  Was the dumpster like the briefcase in Pulp Fiction?
[01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:01.220]  I like that you couldn't smile at the monkey.
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:08.400]  He's a great actor, but if you smile at him, he'll rip your fucking face off. Just don't do it.
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:12.720]  We did it. We watched the monkey movie, guys.
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:15.340]  So how do we feel about Dunstan? Is that worth doing?
[01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:18.200]  I think so. Maybe in March.
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:24.700]  I love doing this supplemental content, and I wish we did it more often.
[01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:30.640]  I feel like I'm shooting myself in the foot by saying that, because it ensures we won't do it again for another four years.
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:38.160]  But I can do these pretty regularly, and I feel like enough movies come by our way that are funny and interesting enough that we could justify it.
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:42.040]  I'm not saying Dunstan should be the next movie, but I do think it should be a movie.
[01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:47.020]  Yes, I completely agree with that. I like Monkey March, too. It's just as an idea.
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:53.760]  Oh, now that's interesting. Monkey March. Maybe we do a monkey movie a week in March.
[01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:56.220]  Yeah, we'll do one movie a week.
[01:32:56.300 --> 01:33:05.600]  I also got to say, after watching MVP2 and your MVP1 synopsis, I no longer want to watch MVP1.
[01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:07.320]  100%. No, there's no reason to.
[01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:10.320]  Yeah, I feel like it cannot possibly hold up to what I just saw.
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:18.660]  Oh, I think I have a movie recommendation for Monkey March, which isn't a real thing, but might become a real thing.
[01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:23.820]  Let me find a trailer quickly. I don't even know if this is part of it. Should we wrap this up?
[01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:25.480]  I definitely think we should.
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.840]  Yeah, but I want to see this trailer you're talking about.
[01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:35.800]  Give me a second. Let me pull it up. I'll drop it in. It's a follow-up to this movie, but it's not specifically related.
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:42.300]  I showed this to Eric before. I've never seen this movie. I've had it recommended a lot by people in the audience.
[01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:54.400]  It's a film called Spy Mate. It's a James Bond-like movie with Richard Kind as the main villain of the film, also starring a young Emma Roberts.
[01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:56.160]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:57.120]  Spy Mate.
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:02.220]  Spy Mate. I just dropped it in our chat. I'm going to watch this one-minute trailer.
[01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:08.820]  I think Louie, the chip that played Louie in the movie, is also in this one as the main character.
[01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:13.140]  Only on DVD.
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:16.680]  It's like they're bragging about that out the gate.
[01:34:24.910 --> 01:34:25.670]  Oh, wow.
[01:34:26.030 --> 01:34:26.810]  Good lord.
[01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:34.870]  They're flying.
[01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:38.990]  Move over, James Bond. Move over, parody of James Bond.
[01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:42.970]  Sword fighting.
[01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:46.190]  Fold out skateboard.
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:57.140]  Is that Mr. Miyagi? Is that Pat Morita?
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:59.440]  I don't know.
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:03.560]  I think they definitely want you to think that.
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:04.480]  Spy Mate.
[01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:08.380]  That looks awesome.
[01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:09.620]  It looks fantastic.
[01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:10.700]  2006.
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:13.120]  Why wouldn't we watch that?
[01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:14.700]  I think it has to go on the list.
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:19.660]  When did real chimps get hoisted out of the movie industry?
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:21.720]  I don't know.
[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:23.620]  Relatively recently, I think, right?
[01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:30.240]  Are we talking any type of monkey? Because you think the Hangover had a real monkey in it?
[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:33.560]  Bubbles, I believe that one is called.
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:45.720]  I just looked up when did we stop doing chimp movies and it is a PETA article from 2020 saying a decade ago there were at least a dozen chimpanzees working in Hollywood.
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:50.740]  There are officially no more chimpanzees in Hollywood as of July 2020.
[01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:51.500]  Okay.
[01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:53.780]  So, yeah, it's very recent.
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:54.400]  That's great.
[01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:55.680]  Horses, though, still fine.
[01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:02.340]  That movie, Spymate, has Barry Bostwick in it, Richard Kind in it, Pat Morita, and Emma Roberts.
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:04.080]  And Louis the monkey.
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:05.620]  What a fucking cast.
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:07.780]  Can't wait to watch?
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:09.680]  I can't wait to watch it either.
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:11.300]  Well, there you go, audience.
[01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:18.900]  I hope you enjoyed this watch-along of MVP2 Most Vertical Primate.
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:20.020]  I want to make sure I get that right.
[01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:28.860]  And hopefully you will tune in sometime in the near future for 2003's Air Bud Entertainment presents Spymate.
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:31.300]  He's a spy and he's a primate.
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:31.860]  Spymate.
[01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:37.140]  And then sometime in the distant future, maybe in monkey March, we will watch Dunstan Cheksin.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.220]  Thank you for your time.
