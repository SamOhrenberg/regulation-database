[00:06.360 --> 00:09.580]  Hello and welcome to a F*** Face Supplemental.
[00:09.660 --> 00:11.300]  You're watching Fruit Throwing.
[00:11.380 --> 00:14.800]  This was supposed to be a thing that we did, but the audio got
[00:14.800 --> 00:15.380]  fucked up.
[00:15.600 --> 00:19.300]  And so I wanted to bring in an expert of vegetables, of fruit,
[00:19.340 --> 00:23.100]  of all things green. TPG is with me. TPG, how are you doing?
[00:23.740 --> 00:24.320]  I'm great.
[00:24.460 --> 00:26.720]  It's great to be back here with the F*** Face gang.
[00:26.720 --> 00:32.100]  You guys know that I'm a huge fan, regulation lurker, and, you
[00:32.100 --> 00:35.760]  know, it's nice, Andrew, that you thought of me for fruit.
[00:35.980 --> 00:36.100]  Of course.
[00:37.120 --> 00:40.760]  I think about the apples all the time.
[00:40.940 --> 00:41.380]  You know what I mean?
[00:41.420 --> 00:45.240]  I know you guys are apple power rankings, and I'm anxiously
[00:46.480 --> 00:50.960]  awaiting when you make the pilgrimage to New England for an
[00:50.960 --> 00:52.500]  apple run, you know?
[00:52.700 --> 00:54.640]  So I'm... Would you need to do that?
[00:55.380 --> 00:56.260]  Yeah, it would be sick.
[00:56.260 --> 01:00.000]  I hit a new orchard this year called Honeypot Orchard, kind of
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.420]  a funny name, but great experience.
[01:03.560 --> 01:09.540]  And I also went to an orchard on, like, peak, peak season, and
[01:09.540 --> 01:10.760]  it was totally nuts.
[01:10.880 --> 01:13.720]  And I had to bail before getting the apple cider doughnuts, which
[01:13.720 --> 01:15.300]  was a f***ing nightmare.
[01:15.660 --> 01:16.340]  Oh, no.
[01:16.700 --> 01:17.380]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:17.640 --> 01:19.980]  Yeah, it was, yeah, it was rough, dude.
[01:20.060 --> 01:23.380]  I told my kid, I was like, yo, we're not waiting in this two-hour
[01:23.380 --> 01:25.540]  line to get this slush and doughnut.
[01:26.260 --> 01:27.740]  Which is tough because, yeah, I love my sweets.
[01:27.880 --> 01:30.020]  But anyway, like, I know about apples.
[01:30.160 --> 01:30.520]  Of course.
[01:31.000 --> 01:32.220]  Yeah, you're an apple guy.
[01:32.580 --> 01:33.840]  What else do you know about fruits?
[01:34.280 --> 01:37.980]  Well, it looks like Eric has some f***ing gourmet fruits here.
[01:38.140 --> 01:38.680]  What is that?
[01:40.820 --> 01:43.540]  A kiwi? He had a dragon fruit.
[01:43.680 --> 01:44.680]  That was my pick.
[01:44.920 --> 01:46.000]  Now he's got kiwis.
[01:46.360 --> 01:47.520]  Yeah, so I guess I should explain.
[01:47.600 --> 01:50.340]  I don't think I said, the audio got f***ed up for this video.
[01:50.440 --> 01:51.660]  So that's why we're doing this.
[01:51.700 --> 01:52.500]  There's no audio.
[01:52.940 --> 01:54.920]  We tried a different method at that time, or they did.
[01:54.920 --> 01:57.640]  I don't want to be blamed for their lack of audio and it screwed up.
[01:57.720 --> 01:59.220]  So that's why we're providing our own commentary.
[01:59.620 --> 02:01.300]  They're about to throw kiwis.
[02:01.700 --> 02:03.040]  TBD, how far do you think this will be?
[02:03.140 --> 02:03.560]  Number one?
[02:03.640 --> 02:05.760]  Where do you think this will rank as far as throwability goes?
[02:07.080 --> 02:09.820]  I think Gavin is a stealth sports guy.
[02:09.900 --> 02:12.120]  So I think he's gonna get at least 20 yards.
[02:12.220 --> 02:12.700]  Here he goes.
[02:13.860 --> 02:14.900]  Oh, oh.
[02:16.760 --> 02:17.880]  I can't see anything.
[02:19.240 --> 02:20.360]  I can't, after throw.
[02:20.620 --> 02:23.520]  Jack is filming this. Hard to identify the target.
[02:23.520 --> 02:25.420]  Yeah, hard to identify the target.
[02:25.840 --> 02:28.360]  Jack is always on me for not eating the pencil.
[02:28.820 --> 02:32.820]  I don't think Jack has found the zoom button in his 40-whatever years of living.
[02:34.160 --> 02:38.660]  I have a feeling that this is gonna be a continuous problem of us not being able to see where it lands.
[02:38.840 --> 02:40.700]  Nick has athlete energy here, dude.
[02:40.960 --> 02:42.520]  Yeah, yeah, he has serious athlete energy.
[02:42.520 --> 02:43.100]  Yeah, you do.
[02:43.280 --> 02:43.760]  Thank you.
[02:44.360 --> 02:45.440]  Somebody played baseball.
[02:45.680 --> 02:48.980]  Although it doesn't look like that went as far as Gavin, dude.
[02:49.000 --> 02:49.380]  I don't know.
[02:49.900 --> 02:50.660]  All right, here he comes.
[02:50.720 --> 02:51.680]  Mr. Stealth Padres.
[02:52.000 --> 02:52.140]  It's hard to tell.
[02:52.380 --> 02:53.000]  Oh, Eric.
[02:53.520 --> 02:54.240]  SoCal God.
[02:55.900 --> 02:56.300]  Oh.
[02:57.300 --> 02:58.360]  I thought that was...
[02:58.360 --> 03:00.560]  Once again, I have no idea where it landed, but I'm sure that was a great throw.
[03:01.040 --> 03:01.240]  Yeah.
[03:02.840 --> 03:03.860]  Oh, and here's Geoff.
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.140]  He thinks Geoff is a 80-mile-per-hour man.
[03:06.480 --> 03:07.200]  Is he throwing left?
[03:07.200 --> 03:08.740]  A lefty 80-mile-per-hour man.
[03:08.780 --> 03:09.720]  This is gonna go to the sun.
[03:11.740 --> 03:12.480]  Not quite.
[03:12.760 --> 03:12.900]  Look at that.
[03:13.020 --> 03:13.920]  An everyday Mac...
[03:13.920 --> 03:15.180]  An everyday Mac...
[03:15.180 --> 03:16.780]  An everyday Mac Jones with that top.
[03:17.140 --> 03:18.020]  Oh my God.
[03:19.500 --> 03:20.640]  Wow, you roasted Geoff.
[03:20.640 --> 03:21.200]  I love it.
[03:21.400 --> 03:21.900]  It's great.
[03:21.900 --> 03:28.040]  I will say Geoff's is the only one I feel like I could see where it landed and went, which is not an ideal sign.
[03:29.360 --> 03:31.320]  This is the long walk to judgment, dude.
[03:31.400 --> 03:32.800]  You know, what do you think they're talking about that?
[03:32.900 --> 03:35.840]  I bet Gavin's like, you saw how much far my shit went, bro.
[03:36.300 --> 03:37.360]  You know, some shit like that.
[03:37.440 --> 03:41.180]  And Eric's like, nah, bro, you didn't go far at all, bro.
[03:41.220 --> 03:42.000]  Let's go get some burritos.
[03:42.440 --> 03:43.960]  I don't know where Geoff's going off to.
[03:44.180 --> 03:45.060]  Oh, look at that.
[03:46.080 --> 03:46.400]  Okay.
[03:48.200 --> 03:48.520]  Oh.
[03:49.060 --> 03:50.240]  Oh, see, he's peeling it.
[03:50.380 --> 03:50.900]  Is he gonna...
[03:50.900 --> 03:51.880]  Is Gavin gonna take a...
[03:51.880 --> 03:52.780]  Oh, he's eating some.
[03:53.180 --> 03:54.180]  Oh, he didn't want to go to waste.
[03:54.500 --> 03:55.300]  I respect it.
[03:55.540 --> 03:56.480]  You don't want to waste fruit.
[03:56.800 --> 03:58.260]  Yeah, we didn't want any of it to go to waste.
[03:58.340 --> 03:59.640]  So we ended up eating the fruit chocolate.
[04:01.600 --> 04:03.680]  It's kind of a sketchy looking kiwi.
[04:04.460 --> 04:05.240]  It was, yeah.
[04:05.240 --> 04:06.980]  And his reaction, I think, confirms that.
[04:06.980 --> 04:08.080]  Green as you want.
[04:11.240 --> 04:13.900]  So looking at the fruit, I'm the one that suggested dragon fruit.
[04:14.000 --> 04:15.100]  I think that was a huge mistake.
[04:15.560 --> 04:17.800]  That's, it's way bigger than I imagined it would be.
[04:17.920 --> 04:19.920]  I think that it'll, that'll easily be last.
[04:21.220 --> 04:22.320]  It's built like a football, though.
[04:22.320 --> 04:22.940]  Yeah, but the weight can help.
[04:23.060 --> 04:23.800]  It's like a shot put.
[04:24.360 --> 04:24.740]  That's true.
[04:24.800 --> 04:26.500]  Is this apples or, or, or a...
[04:26.500 --> 04:28.280]  Yeah, it looks like we got some apples going.
[04:29.000 --> 04:29.360]  I don't know.
[04:29.440 --> 04:30.960]  Nick, do you remember what kind of apple it was?
[04:32.200 --> 04:33.680]  I don't off the top of my head.
[04:33.800 --> 04:35.300]  I, it wasn't a Cosmic Crisp.
[04:35.440 --> 04:36.680]  I went with something smaller.
[04:37.060 --> 04:37.360]  Oh, you can't throw those.
[04:37.700 --> 04:38.380]  No, no, no.
[04:38.500 --> 04:39.980]  Also, they're huge, right?
[04:39.980 --> 04:40.880]  Here he comes, dude.
[04:41.020 --> 04:41.720]  Yeah, not as aerodynamic.
[04:43.540 --> 04:46.620]  I hope Gavin eats one of these again after it smashes, dude.
[04:46.640 --> 04:47.060]  That's like really...
[04:47.060 --> 04:47.540]  Oh, he better.
[04:47.600 --> 04:48.560]  Oh, who's going here?
[04:48.700 --> 04:49.300]  Is that fake out?
[04:49.420 --> 04:50.120]  Oh, oh!
[04:51.060 --> 04:51.840]  Here he comes.
[04:53.300 --> 04:55.240]  It's like flea flicker, but fruit throwing.
[04:56.800 --> 04:57.480]  Here he goes.
[04:57.700 --> 04:57.840]  Ooh!
[04:58.120 --> 04:58.320]  Oh!
[04:59.120 --> 04:59.960]  That was a great throw.
[05:00.180 --> 05:00.480]  Oh!
[05:01.160 --> 05:01.520]  Shattered pieces.
[05:01.520 --> 05:02.340]  I have no idea where that went.
[05:02.760 --> 05:04.440]  Well, it blew into pieces once it hit the yellow.
[05:04.440 --> 05:05.500]  I think it detonated, dude.
[05:05.640 --> 05:05.800]  Yeah.
[05:06.420 --> 05:07.100]  That's great.
[05:07.300 --> 05:08.540]  These did not survive impact.
[05:08.560 --> 05:08.820]  Here he comes.
[05:08.960 --> 05:10.000]  Oh, look at...
[05:10.000 --> 05:10.600]  Really?
[05:10.740 --> 05:12.340]  Oh, that's an interesting problem.
[05:13.320 --> 05:16.520]  Yeah, so we had to figure out how to judge it based on base.
[05:16.520 --> 05:18.640]  Yeah, how are you gonna, how are you gonna figure that out?
[05:19.180 --> 05:22.640]  I think we went with whatever chunk was the largest is where it wound up.
[05:23.260 --> 05:25.000]  Gavin has the weirdest throw.
[05:26.060 --> 05:29.220]  It's so, like, it's effective, but it looks so unathletic.
[05:29.860 --> 05:30.220]  It's so...
[05:30.220 --> 05:31.020]  Wait, what's happening?
[05:31.160 --> 05:32.240]  Did he throw the wrong thing?
[05:32.320 --> 05:33.120]  Why is he throwing again?
[05:34.000 --> 05:34.380]  I...
[05:34.380 --> 05:35.680]  Okay, here he goes.
[05:36.660 --> 05:37.640]  I guess he called it a false?
[05:39.740 --> 05:40.500]  A fault.
[05:40.740 --> 05:42.000]  It was, it was a balk, dude.
[05:42.060 --> 05:42.640]  It was a balk.
[05:42.820 --> 05:43.860]  Was that what they call it in baseball?
[05:44.120 --> 05:46.820]  Like impossible, like, rule to understand?
[05:46.840 --> 05:47.240]  A foul.
[05:47.560 --> 05:48.100]  Oh, he's picking a different one.
[05:48.100 --> 05:48.780]  I have no idea.
[05:50.220 --> 05:51.620]  Oh, they're having a great time, though.
[05:51.900 --> 05:52.300]  Eric will know.
[05:52.940 --> 05:53.760]  It's a baseball.
[05:53.880 --> 05:54.420]  Oh, here he goes.
[05:54.880 --> 05:57.060]  It's a very cricket throw, I think.
[05:57.760 --> 05:58.920]  Yeah, you know what?
[05:58.920 --> 05:59.980]  That's a great call, Nick.
[06:00.040 --> 06:00.920]  I've never put that together.
[06:01.020 --> 06:02.260]  It is very cricket-like.
[06:02.400 --> 06:04.180]  It's a natural British throw, right?
[06:07.690 --> 06:09.550]  I've longed to become more cricket adjacent.
[06:11.270 --> 06:12.630]  I can't figure it out.
[06:13.250 --> 06:14.010]  I've tried.
[06:14.110 --> 06:15.670]  I just can't wrap my head around the rules.
[06:17.530 --> 06:18.890]  Whoa, somebody's in the red.
[06:18.890 --> 06:20.170]  What do we got there?
[06:21.370 --> 06:21.970]  Oh, wow.
[06:22.010 --> 06:23.730]  Looks like someone took a huge chunk out of it.
[06:24.690 --> 06:25.650]  I got pieces everywhere.
[06:25.790 --> 06:26.250]  You weren't kidding.
[06:26.490 --> 06:26.550]  Eat it.
[06:26.910 --> 06:27.330]  Eat it.
[06:27.710 --> 06:28.530]  Eat it.
[06:28.790 --> 06:29.490]  Oh, look at that bruise.
[06:29.650 --> 06:30.030]  I don't like that.
[06:30.090 --> 06:30.650]  Makes me uncomfortable.
[06:31.250 --> 06:34.570]  So far, the Kiwi is holding strong as the furthest throw.
[06:35.090 --> 06:36.410]  So, Apple now to...
[06:36.410 --> 06:37.210]  Who's Kiwi?
[06:38.270 --> 06:39.030]  Who's Kiwi?
[06:39.690 --> 06:40.110]  Gavin's?
[06:41.410 --> 06:42.490]  Might have been Gavin.
[06:42.870 --> 06:43.910]  I was Apple's.
[06:43.990 --> 06:44.490]  This is...
[06:44.490 --> 06:47.070]  I believe Eric is Avocado here.
[06:47.990 --> 06:48.910]  Oh, I like that.
[06:48.990 --> 06:50.910]  You got the big seed in it for that weight.
[06:51.250 --> 06:52.090]  It's smaller.
[06:53.090 --> 06:54.850]  I can see Avocado being a number one pick.
[06:55.710 --> 06:56.030]  Yeah.
[06:56.470 --> 06:58.290]  Yeah, you could toss these things, dude.
[07:01.270 --> 07:02.570]  Look at that grip, dude.
[07:02.690 --> 07:03.110]  Who is that?
[07:03.170 --> 07:03.530]  Pedro?
[07:03.990 --> 07:04.470]  And if...
[07:04.470 --> 07:06.010]  But also, it depends on the ripeness, too.
[07:06.130 --> 07:06.290]  Yeah.
[07:06.790 --> 07:09.570]  Yeah, if it's too ripe, the thumb go right into it, dude.
[07:09.690 --> 07:10.450]  That'd be a disaster.
[07:13.290 --> 07:14.110]  I love this.
[07:14.210 --> 07:14.630]  Let's do...
[07:14.630 --> 07:15.350]  Let's go, dude.
[07:15.370 --> 07:15.730]  Okay.
[07:16.710 --> 07:19.530]  Oh, that was not his best throw, but he got some air.
[07:19.750 --> 07:20.670]  Whoa, and bounce.
[07:21.050 --> 07:22.590]  It looks like we're past the red.
[07:22.650 --> 07:23.630]  Look at that roll, dude.
[07:23.690 --> 07:24.710]  That's what you want to see.
[07:25.190 --> 07:25.950]  Holy cow.
[07:27.150 --> 07:28.350]  A real shot, dude.
[07:28.390 --> 07:29.830]  Here he goes, the left-handed king.
[07:31.950 --> 07:32.330]  Whoa.
[07:32.550 --> 07:34.910]  Oh, he put some power in that one.
[07:36.390 --> 07:37.430]  As easily as his best throw.
[07:37.770 --> 07:41.050]  Less Mac Jones, more Tua and Jalen Hurts.
[07:41.390 --> 07:42.770]  This is pure Alabama energy.
[07:42.870 --> 07:43.210]  I love it.
[07:43.310 --> 07:43.550]  Uh-oh.
[07:43.550 --> 07:46.250]  This truck is going to run over the evidence, dude.
[07:46.430 --> 07:47.410]  Can't be having that.
[07:51.510 --> 07:53.410]  You guys seem really concerned about the truck.
[07:53.850 --> 07:59.110]  I think we were worried it was going to destroy our work and or park where we were throwing.
[08:00.310 --> 08:00.610]  Oh.
[08:01.350 --> 08:02.070]  You would have had to target.
[08:02.570 --> 08:04.490]  Weird bounce on that.
[08:04.650 --> 08:05.090]  You know what I mean?
[08:05.890 --> 08:08.770]  Yeah, it's sort of a strange thing of like, how do you factor in the rolling?
[08:08.950 --> 08:12.670]  Like almost the shape of the fruit with the roll potential gives you an edge.
[08:14.550 --> 08:17.850]  Oh, that looks like it's past the red.
[08:18.190 --> 08:19.390]  Oh, is that tight?
[08:19.590 --> 08:21.410]  This kind of reminds me of bocce, Andrew.
[08:21.510 --> 08:23.350]  I don't know if you're proficient in yard games.
[08:23.450 --> 08:24.310]  Yeah, absolutely.
[08:24.610 --> 08:26.570]  The rolling of the balls is a...
[08:26.570 --> 08:26.690]  Yes.
[08:27.130 --> 08:29.070]  Yeah, I'm a big yard game guy.
[08:29.130 --> 08:31.290]  Not so much cornhole, more bocce and others.
[08:31.610 --> 08:32.230]  Oh, interesting.
[08:33.330 --> 08:35.050]  What do you have against cornhole?
[08:35.730 --> 08:37.550]  Yeah, what's the cornhole problem?
[08:38.710 --> 08:40.130]  It's just like it's a little too...
[08:40.130 --> 08:41.650]  The bro energy is a little too stronger.
[08:41.650 --> 08:44.690]  I prefer like the gentlemanly Italian energy of bocce.
[08:44.950 --> 08:45.530]  You know what I mean?
[08:46.210 --> 08:46.650]  Yeah.
[08:47.010 --> 08:48.930]  No, yeah, I respect that completely.
[08:49.030 --> 08:49.750]  Yeah, I feel that.
[08:51.570 --> 08:52.530]  It's a great game.
[08:54.410 --> 08:55.270]  Look at that.
[08:55.510 --> 08:56.130]  Interesting people.
[08:56.290 --> 08:56.890]  Oh, he's snacking away?
[08:58.150 --> 08:58.570]  Oh, yeah.
[09:00.250 --> 09:01.330]  We gonna get a bite out of this?
[09:02.210 --> 09:05.170]  These all survived pretty well, aside from the...
[09:05.170 --> 09:06.490]  the shell being shredded.
[09:06.790 --> 09:08.390]  Some of them should eat it, dude.
[09:09.270 --> 09:10.390]  Wow, who put that there?
[09:10.610 --> 09:11.250]  Whose is that?
[09:11.250 --> 09:12.030]  Is that Nick's?
[09:12.430 --> 09:13.190]  That one was mine.
[09:13.350 --> 09:14.330]  I went to check on it.
[09:14.370 --> 09:16.750]  I lifted it and Eric yelled at me for touching the evidence.
[09:17.230 --> 09:18.210]  Of course he would.
[09:18.530 --> 09:19.410]  It's a very weird move.
[09:20.530 --> 09:23.090]  Well, it was his pick, so he didn't want anything to be messed with.
[09:23.130 --> 09:23.950]  I see.
[09:24.190 --> 09:26.710]  Okay, so is that the lead at this point?
[09:26.930 --> 09:27.730]  Oh, I love this.
[09:27.730 --> 09:28.610]  Oh, there we go.
[09:29.390 --> 09:29.790]  Pure...
[09:29.790 --> 09:30.630]  Yeah, dude.
[09:30.770 --> 09:31.170]  Wow.
[09:32.170 --> 09:33.670]  That is fantastic, dude.
[09:33.810 --> 09:35.670]  Without salt or anything, dude.
[09:35.730 --> 09:38.770]  Just pure dedication to the game, dude.
[09:38.770 --> 09:41.210]  I don't think I've ever eaten an avocado like that before.
[09:41.370 --> 09:42.510]  It's kind of shocking right now.
[09:43.590 --> 09:44.850]  I'm not an avocado guy.
[09:44.930 --> 09:46.350]  Is this a normal thing for the F*** Face group?
[09:47.190 --> 09:48.490]  Uh, not that I'm aware of.
[09:48.630 --> 09:49.210]  What about you, Nick?
[09:49.290 --> 09:50.870]  Nick, have you ever had an avocado like this?
[09:51.250 --> 09:54.050]  Uh, I did this day, but, uh...
[09:54.050 --> 09:55.590]  I will say that outside of this...
[09:55.850 --> 09:58.230]  No, usually it's got to be salted or something, right?
[09:58.250 --> 10:00.490]  It's got to be accompanying something else.
[10:00.930 --> 10:03.430]  I didn't know you salted avocado when eating it.
[10:03.590 --> 10:04.030]  Oh, yeah.
[10:04.350 --> 10:04.810]  Good flavor.
[10:05.250 --> 10:05.930]  Oh, yeah, got to.
[10:07.290 --> 10:08.130]  I'm not gonna lie.
[10:08.130 --> 10:11.950]  Seeing them eat these avocados is making me deeply jealous and extremely hungry.
[10:12.130 --> 10:13.870]  It just looks like a great hang, dude.
[10:14.130 --> 10:16.970]  Like, you know, I don't get to see Eric and Gav as much.
[10:17.090 --> 10:21.010]  But if I was with them, I would want to be eating a cotto with them, dude.
[10:21.230 --> 10:23.950]  Maybe the next movie night y'all have.
[10:24.150 --> 10:27.790]  Just the boys hanging out with some cottos, some salt.
[10:29.130 --> 10:30.510]  We're on to lemons here.
[10:30.590 --> 10:31.210]  Oh, look at that.
[10:31.270 --> 10:32.790]  Toss on the lemons.
[10:33.530 --> 10:33.850]  Wow.
[10:34.590 --> 10:35.790]  Strong roll, dude.
[10:37.410 --> 10:38.330]  Or are they oranges?
[10:38.490 --> 10:39.050]  Strong roll.
[10:39.330 --> 10:39.850]  Are these oranges?
[10:40.350 --> 10:41.110]  I think they're oranges.
[10:41.450 --> 10:42.850]  Oh, yeah.
[10:42.890 --> 10:43.630]  I don't know about that.
[10:43.790 --> 10:44.850]  Love a good citrus.
[10:45.890 --> 10:46.710]  Ooh, it could be a lemon.
[10:49.250 --> 10:50.290]  What do we got here?
[10:50.570 --> 10:51.650]  Is he gonna do a roll?
[10:52.070 --> 10:54.530]  Oh my god, this is gonna be a fascinating thing.
[10:54.770 --> 10:56.430]  Is he going full botchy?
[10:56.790 --> 10:58.690]  Oh, he's actually doing the...
[10:59.670 --> 11:01.210]  Oh, no, that was just terrible.
[11:01.630 --> 11:04.370]  That was the worst version of whatever he was thinking of.
[11:04.370 --> 11:05.550]  Right to the ground.
[11:08.270 --> 11:09.250]  Immaculate form, dude.
[11:09.510 --> 11:10.630]  That was electric, dude.
[11:10.750 --> 11:11.730]  That's what you want, you know?
[11:14.790 --> 11:16.530]  I have a feeling no one's gonna copy that throw.
[11:16.590 --> 11:17.230]  Nick's athlete energy is up.
[11:17.290 --> 11:17.870]  The chart's here.
[11:19.470 --> 11:19.830]  Oh.
[11:21.150 --> 11:23.630]  Nick, I will say your throw is the least embarrassing.
[11:24.030 --> 11:25.970]  Like, you may not always get the distance,
[11:26.110 --> 11:29.490]  but there's never a time in which you're looking bad during any of these.
[11:30.230 --> 11:30.750]  Thank you.
[11:30.870 --> 11:32.950]  Yeah, you look like you have played baseball, dude.
[11:32.950 --> 11:34.750]  You have baseball skillset.
[11:34.810 --> 11:37.170]  Oh, it's coming through, dude.
[11:37.570 --> 11:38.350]  It's coming through.
[11:39.850 --> 11:41.510]  I need that Gavin throw again, dude.
[11:41.530 --> 11:42.270]  That shit was electric.
[11:42.370 --> 11:42.910]  Here we go.
[11:43.670 --> 11:44.290]  I think...
[11:44.790 --> 11:45.670]  Oh, where'd it go?
[11:47.610 --> 11:49.050]  That was a terrible throw.
[11:49.250 --> 11:52.590]  I mean, he kissed it, he did all this prep, and it just snuck out of his finger.
[11:52.710 --> 11:53.730]  It immediately got air.
[11:56.130 --> 12:01.150]  I don't know if you guys have covered this, but like, you know, I used to see Eric sometimes playing baseball.
[12:01.350 --> 12:02.070]  Oh, look at that.
[12:02.070 --> 12:02.870]  Is that a grapefruit?
[12:02.990 --> 12:03.550]  It's a blood orange.
[12:03.810 --> 12:04.610]  It's a blood orange.
[12:05.610 --> 12:06.010]  Damn.
[12:07.390 --> 12:07.930]  That's right.
[12:07.990 --> 12:08.690]  These were delicious.
[12:08.810 --> 12:09.550]  I remember now.
[12:12.270 --> 12:12.910]  Oh, that's great.
[12:13.090 --> 12:13.890]  Get in there, Gavin.
[12:14.710 --> 12:16.090]  What a great sport.
[12:16.370 --> 12:18.390]  Throw some fruit, eat the fruit.
[12:19.290 --> 12:19.870]  What a time.
[12:20.330 --> 12:21.270]  Throw fruit, eat fruit.
[12:22.350 --> 12:23.070]  It's perfect.
[12:23.470 --> 12:23.830]  Profit.
[12:24.010 --> 12:24.470]  Yeah, dude.
[12:24.670 --> 12:25.070]  Yes.
[12:25.130 --> 12:31.670]  This is making me super FOMO'd out, bro, that I'm not just out there just tossing and crushing fruit, dude.
[12:31.670 --> 12:32.150]  Wow.
[12:32.410 --> 12:33.550]  What a guess, Eric.
[12:34.310 --> 12:35.190]  Blood oranges, dude.
[12:35.530 --> 12:35.930]  Fantastic.
[12:38.210 --> 12:38.950]  I think you just read it.
[12:38.950 --> 12:40.550]  What's your favorite thing to pair with a blood orange?
[12:41.390 --> 12:42.850]  We thinking like a sauce?
[12:43.270 --> 12:44.370]  I eat that raw, bro.
[12:44.630 --> 12:45.170]  Oh, raw?
[12:45.330 --> 12:46.810]  We're just going raw off the blood orange?
[12:49.730 --> 13:00.010]  I used to dump like five cups of brown sugar on my grapefruit, but then I became an adult, you know, and I don't do that anymore.
[13:03.010 --> 13:03.810]  Clementines are great.
[13:04.090 --> 13:04.830]  Love a clementine.
[13:05.550 --> 13:06.330]  Oh, yeah, bro.
[13:06.730 --> 13:07.310]  Big fan.
[13:07.450 --> 13:11.510]  Hey, I gotta tell you, Andrew, just remember, dude, one peel, one world.
[13:11.870 --> 13:14.530]  I'm actually a pioneer in the one peel space.
[13:15.490 --> 13:19.810]  There's a documentary on the Green Life channel about the one peel, one world movement.
[13:20.470 --> 13:22.390]  I wish I was joking, but I'm actually not.
[13:22.690 --> 13:26.150]  Yes, that's when you try to peel one peel in one peel.
[13:27.090 --> 13:28.370]  It's extremely satisfying.
[13:28.490 --> 13:29.610]  What kind of fruit we got here now?
[13:29.610 --> 13:31.010]  Damn, you guys got a lot of fruit, dude.
[13:31.050 --> 13:31.630]  I thought there was like...
[13:31.630 --> 13:32.090]  Yeah, it's...
[13:32.090 --> 13:33.290]  Are those... what do we got?
[13:33.690 --> 13:34.550]  This is the dragon fruit.
[13:34.650 --> 13:35.730]  This is the one that Andrew picked.
[13:36.690 --> 13:38.370]  Oh, yeah, this is not going to go well.
[13:38.930 --> 13:41.250]  It has weight, but I don't like the shape.
[13:41.450 --> 13:42.190]  They were heavy.
[13:42.390 --> 13:47.450]  Now, here's the thing I said that they might have going for them is that they're a little bit football shaped.
[13:47.690 --> 13:47.930]  Yeah.
[13:48.150 --> 13:52.050]  So maybe if you spiraled it just right, you'd get a good distance on them.
[13:52.050 --> 13:53.630]  I feel like Gavin's going,
[13:53.630 --> 13:55.590]  Oh, it's not aerodynamic.
[13:56.090 --> 13:59.270]  The edges are going to block into the wind.
[14:02.170 --> 14:03.970]  I need the roll again.
[14:04.090 --> 14:05.030]  Bring the roll back, Gav.
[14:05.590 --> 14:08.670]  Oh, hey, that was pretty good.
[14:10.430 --> 14:12.330]  Once again, a zoom would be great here, Jack.
[14:12.410 --> 14:16.230]  I don't know what status Jack is at, but he's definitely in the minors after this.
[14:17.290 --> 14:18.710]  I felt good about that throw.
[14:18.970 --> 14:20.490]  It had a nice spiral on it.
[14:22.050 --> 14:23.990]  I will say, seeing you guys all with your fruit.
[14:24.170 --> 14:27.890]  It's like the saddest middle-aged game of Fruit Ninja I've ever seen.
[14:28.050 --> 14:29.450]  I say that lovingly.
[14:33.190 --> 14:34.430]  That's a tough one from Eric.
[14:34.570 --> 14:38.870]  You know, I was going to say Eric and Geoff have sunglasses, which could be a good competitive edge, but I don't know.
[14:38.870 --> 14:40.530]  That's a great point, TPG.
[14:40.730 --> 14:42.790]  God, Andrew, that felt too real when you said it, man.
[14:46.790 --> 14:47.150]  Yeah.
[14:48.710 --> 14:51.870]  Yeah, the long walk to dragon fruit destiny.
[14:52.230 --> 14:53.150]  Here we go, dude.
[14:53.830 --> 14:55.910]  I've never been a big dragon fruit guy.
[14:56.070 --> 14:59.370]  Sick name, incredible look to the plant, very like Promethean.
[14:59.550 --> 15:03.230]  But I just, I never, I couldn't tell you what it tastes like if I tried.
[15:03.350 --> 15:04.750]  Isn't that the white seeded one?
[15:04.910 --> 15:05.850]  Yeah, the inside.
[15:06.190 --> 15:07.050]  Yeah, that's the one.
[15:07.130 --> 15:09.190]  I think it's famously pretty tasteless.
[15:09.430 --> 15:11.510]  This one was surprisingly sweet.
[15:13.170 --> 15:14.710]  Could I ask a question?
[15:14.830 --> 15:15.650]  I don't mean this.
[15:15.650 --> 15:18.110]  Like, listen, this, I wasn't here, you guys were leading.
[15:18.370 --> 15:18.790]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:18.830 --> 15:22.090]  Was it necessary to walk out after every throw?
[15:22.590 --> 15:26.350]  Couldn't you have just thrown all the fruit and then walked out?
[15:26.950 --> 15:29.610]  I, that's an excellent question, you know?
[15:29.930 --> 15:38.090]  I don't really understand the logistics of why you guys are doing the, I love it as a content watcher, as TPG says, the great fruit walk for everyone.
[15:38.490 --> 15:41.490]  But I just don't understand the reasoning behind this.
[15:41.490 --> 15:52.370]  I think we were doing it with the intent to eat what was not the furthest of the grouping thrown, and then to bring it back before it got too hot, and then just leave the other ones as they were.
[15:52.370 --> 15:53.250]  Got it, okay.
[15:53.670 --> 15:54.590]  So it's a preserve.
[15:54.970 --> 15:58.990]  Was it wicked hot when you made this, dude? Was this wicked hot when you shot this?
[15:59.090 --> 16:02.230]  Yeah, it was brutally hot, I'm pretty sure, here, yeah.
[16:04.110 --> 16:07.830]  I will say this, it's making me so hungry, so hungry.
[16:08.650 --> 16:13.210]  We also shot this right before the port-a-potty thing, where, with the Sir Strumming.
[16:13.330 --> 16:14.070]  Oh, yeah.
[16:14.170 --> 16:14.790]  Oh, okay.
[16:15.770 --> 16:18.310]  Okay, so this is where they're ranking the placement, I'm guessing.
[16:18.550 --> 16:18.850]  Yes.
[16:19.130 --> 16:21.150]  So, dragon fruit last.
[16:21.770 --> 16:23.610]  And everybody's holding their respective pick.
[16:23.790 --> 16:24.190]  Wow!
[16:26.690 --> 16:27.990]  The avocado won!
[16:28.070 --> 16:30.890]  I'm not surprised with this ranking, I'm not surprised with this ranking.
[16:31.010 --> 16:37.010]  I would have loved to see a better representation for Blood Orange, which, in addition to a sick name, is delicious.
[16:37.010 --> 16:40.090]  But, I mean, how can the avocado not reign supreme, you know what I mean?
[16:40.770 --> 16:41.350]  That's a great point.
[16:41.350 --> 16:41.990]  This is a ceremony?
[16:42.530 --> 16:42.830]  Yeah.
[16:43.610 --> 16:44.670]  What's happening here?
[16:44.850 --> 16:45.670]  Olympic style.
[16:46.450 --> 16:46.870]  Oh!
[16:48.410 --> 16:50.330]  Wait, did I not even make the podium?
[16:50.810 --> 16:51.570]  Oh, yeah, I did.
[16:51.770 --> 16:54.550]  I did last, as expected.
[16:55.190 --> 16:56.390]  That's fine, I wasn't there.
[16:57.990 --> 16:58.530]  What a fine group of gentlemen, dude.
[16:58.530 --> 17:02.370]  You look so happy, just a bunch of grown-ass men with fruit in your hands.
[17:03.650 --> 17:04.990]  Grown fruit in our hands.
[17:06.930 --> 17:09.130]  Wow, there it is, dude.
[17:09.650 --> 17:11.550]  You know, the avocado is such a wild card.
[17:11.630 --> 17:16.110]  I would have encouraged you guys to make, like, a smoothie or something with the excess.
[17:17.110 --> 17:21.810]  Could have been a fun challenge, but an avocado smoothie?
[17:22.030 --> 17:22.570]  Does that exist?
[17:22.730 --> 17:26.430]  That must exist in a hip land like Austin, right?
[17:26.910 --> 17:28.470]  Oh, absolutely, it does.
[17:28.610 --> 17:29.530]  You know it does.
[17:30.060 --> 17:34.870]  If not the great fruit throw of 2024, we will add smoothies into the mix.
[17:36.410 --> 17:37.650]  TBG, that was so much fun.
[17:37.810 --> 17:38.890]  Thank you for joining us.
[17:39.030 --> 17:45.530]  Thank you for those great fruit takes, learning about One Peel Nation, talking about the green life.
[17:45.670 --> 17:46.970]  This is a wonderful time.
[17:47.050 --> 17:47.610]  I had so much fun.
[17:47.830 --> 17:50.970]  Thank you for helping us salvage this audio-less video.
[17:51.450 --> 17:52.330]  Yes, of course, dude.
[17:52.330 --> 17:57.950]  I will tell you, a fruit that I grew that I think I would love to see thrown,
[17:57.950 --> 18:02.210]  which could add an exquisite variety here, would actually be a cantaloupe.
[18:02.790 --> 18:10.490]  So, fun facts about cantaloupe, not really a fact at all, but I grew a cantaloupe when I lived in Texas,
[18:10.830 --> 18:13.830]  and it was amazing, mostly because it actually grew.
[18:14.010 --> 18:16.790]  But also, I feel like most cantaloupe you eat kind of sucks.
[18:16.890 --> 18:18.630]  Like, it's in, like, a fruit cup at, like, an airport.
[18:18.890 --> 18:21.190]  You're like, oh god, like, why am I doing this, you know?
[18:21.430 --> 18:25.130]  Or even a supermarket. Like, I'm not going to some bougie Whole Foods, like, supermarket.
[18:25.290 --> 18:26.410]  I'm just, like, a normal cantaloupe.
[18:26.870 --> 18:27.690]  It's never good, right?
[18:27.690 --> 18:34.450]  But when I ate this cantaloupe that I grew, it, like, completely, like, paradigm-shifted my life
[18:34.450 --> 18:37.610]  around cantaloupe and melons of that variety.
[18:38.210 --> 18:40.770]  And they also exploded, like, in an incredible way.
[18:41.110 --> 18:45.870]  So, I would love to see, especially Geoff, with his, like, more football-focused toss,
[18:46.890 --> 18:49.230]  with, like, more of a shot put thing, you know?
[18:49.710 --> 18:50.150]  Okay.
[18:50.630 --> 18:52.930]  So, that's just my note about cantaloupe.
[18:53.230 --> 18:54.630]  So, you want it just for the juice?
[18:55.190 --> 18:56.930]  Yeah, for the splash.
[18:57.370 --> 18:58.350]  For the splash.
[18:58.910 --> 19:05.150]  Yeah, and I think the shape of it and the grit could lead to some interesting throwing styles.
[19:05.290 --> 19:06.930]  And that's one of the things I want to ask you about, Andrew.
[19:07.190 --> 19:13.250]  And Nick was like, you know, we saw a lot of throws here, but we did see Gavin's, like, cricket bowl-inspired thing.
[19:13.530 --> 19:13.550]  Uh-huh.
[19:14.170 --> 19:21.950]  Have you guys ever considered about, like, fruit bowling, like, or fruit bocce in terms of, like, the roll versus a throw?
[19:22.630 --> 19:23.590]  Oh, that's interesting.
[19:23.590 --> 19:30.070]  I like the idea of, like, fruit bocce, but, like, the ball you try to roll to is a blender, like you were saying.
[19:30.570 --> 19:34.170]  You gotta get the different fruit in there, and then somebody has to drink whatever ended up in the blender.
[19:34.510 --> 19:37.290]  That's a sick—if you get a huge blender, that'd be savage, dude.
[19:37.570 --> 19:38.870]  That—yeah, that'd be a sick game.
[19:39.770 --> 19:40.670]  Is coconut a fruit?
[19:41.450 --> 19:42.190]  Good question.
[19:43.530 --> 19:46.070]  Because I'm thinking about Gavin's bocce throw.
[19:46.090 --> 19:46.550]  I think so.
[19:46.850 --> 19:47.290]  Well—
[19:47.290 --> 19:51.350]  If you get that bocce throw with a coconut, that thing would still be going.
[19:51.350 --> 19:52.490]  It's still rolling.
[19:52.590 --> 19:54.790]  I think that would undeniably be number one.
[19:54.970 --> 19:57.010]  Yeah, you could cook with coconut for sure.
[19:57.030 --> 20:04.570]  The other fruit-based activity that I used to do in my life when I was much younger was a greased watermelon race.
[20:04.790 --> 20:05.730]  Have you all ever done that?
[20:06.110 --> 20:06.630]  No!
[20:07.190 --> 20:07.550]  What?
[20:07.890 --> 20:09.990]  What is a greased watermelon race?
[20:10.190 --> 20:12.570]  Like, you're greased or the watermelon is greased?
[20:12.710 --> 20:14.170]  What is—what is this?
[20:15.130 --> 20:22.450]  So we would do it at, like, the local town beach, like the local town lake, you know, which I always loved because I was never a pool kid.
[20:22.910 --> 20:31.430]  But, like, all these kids—you would get, like, huge watermelons on July 4th, like big boys, like, long, not like the little small, like, ball ones.
[20:31.490 --> 20:34.170]  And you would just, like, cover it in Crisco or something.
[20:34.650 --> 20:39.650]  And then you would have to, in the water, move it a distance, you know what I mean?
[20:39.650 --> 20:44.870]  So, like, if, you know, if you push it, like, it doesn't—you're basically, like, pushing, like, a spinning watermelon.
[20:45.010 --> 20:46.310]  And it's, like, impossible to pick up.
[20:47.510 --> 20:49.870]  And I look back on that fondly, to be honest.
[20:49.990 --> 20:55.730]  But I think about it now, like, strategically, like, what—like, what the—what the move would be there, you know?
[20:57.050 --> 21:00.090]  I—yeah, I'm gonna—I'm gonna have to take a deep dive on that.
[21:00.230 --> 21:01.510]  First, I'm gonna have to learn about it.
[21:01.550 --> 21:02.930]  I'm gonna have to see footage of it.
[21:04.310 --> 21:07.130]  And maybe—maybe we'll do something else soon in the near future.
[21:07.130 --> 21:09.310]  We could go deep on the watermelons.
[21:09.430 --> 21:11.730]  Do you have apple cannons up where you live?
[21:11.950 --> 21:12.950]  Up in the Pacific Northwest?
[21:13.550 --> 21:16.710]  No, what are—what—what are apple cannons?
[21:17.190 --> 21:21.530]  So, I've never seen that, because I live in refined New England, where the orchards are pristine and magical.
[21:21.730 --> 21:27.170]  But I've heard that other parts of the country—I'm not trying to say where you live isn't pristine and magical, by the way.
[21:27.270 --> 21:28.210]  Shout-out Pacific Northwest.
[21:28.530 --> 21:29.430]  Like, shout-out Forks.
[21:29.790 --> 21:36.870]  But there's—I—I think at apple orchards, you can, like, put, uh...
[21:36.870 --> 21:40.870]  You can put apples into, like, I think, like a—a cannon.
[21:41.230 --> 21:45.570]  Like, maybe like a potato launcher-style thing? I don't—I'm not sure the mechanism.
[21:46.330 --> 21:50.790]  But then you can, like, launch a rotten apple, like, at a target, and it kind of, like, explodes.
[21:51.530 --> 21:52.230]  That's great.
[21:52.830 --> 21:55.250]  We need cannons. We need blenders.
[21:55.610 --> 21:57.310]  We—we got a lot for the next Fruit Throw.
[21:57.830 --> 22:00.070]  Yeah, we def—you guys definitely do. I'm excited.
[22:00.330 --> 22:03.510]  Anyway, I could clearly talk about fruit all day. You guys can tell that.
[22:03.510 --> 22:07.450]  I'm a big—a big—big fruit guy. You know, big veg guy, too.
[22:07.590 --> 22:11.430]  We haven't even talked about the tomato toss here, which would be just insane.
[22:13.470 --> 22:14.490]  But we'll save that for another time.
[22:14.490 --> 22:17.210]  We need to go deeper, and we'll—we'll do that soon, TPG.
[22:17.250 --> 22:19.350]  Do you want to plug your YouTube channel while you're here?
[22:19.650 --> 22:23.190]  Yes, I would. I would encourage y'all to watch The Green Life with TPG.
[22:23.390 --> 22:24.490]  You can find me on YouTube.
[22:25.090 --> 22:29.910]  I'm, like, roughly 80 subscribers away from the ultimate dream of 1,000 subscribers.
[22:30.210 --> 22:31.070]  So please go stop.
[22:31.070 --> 22:36.090]  This is the hardest I've ever pushed this channel in any content ever, but, uh...
[22:36.090 --> 22:40.330]  I think you guys would really like it, and go watch One Peel One World, dude.
[22:40.830 --> 22:42.050]  It's a—it's a movement.
[22:42.490 --> 22:49.010]  If you're hating clementines this holiday season, be sure to challenge yourself to a One Peel and show your results, dude.
[22:49.810 --> 22:51.030]  I'm leaving all y'all.
[22:51.290 --> 22:53.630]  This is fantastic, guys. Thank you so much for having me.
[22:53.910 --> 22:54.350]  Thanks, man.
[22:54.410 --> 22:55.390]  Oh, it's been a pleasure, TPG.
[22:55.790 --> 22:57.250]  Thank you so much for listening.
[22:57.410 --> 22:57.810]  You got it.
[22:57.850 --> 22:59.490]  I hope you enjoyed the video.
[23:00.330 --> 23:01.010]  Bye.
[23:01.310 --> 23:01.990]  Bye.
[23:02.490 --> 23:03.010]  See ya.
