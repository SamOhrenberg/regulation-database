[00:02.040 --> 00:02.420]  OOF!
[00:03.260 --> 00:03.640]  OOF!
[00:05.060 --> 00:05.440]  OOF!
[00:05.440 --> 00:05.480]  OOF!
[00:06.100 --> 00:07.680]  Well, we're here to see which...
[00:07.680 --> 00:08.340]  Jesus Christ!
[00:09.780 --> 00:12.080]  We're here to see which fruit can go the furthest.
[00:12.880 --> 00:15.780]  And what that means is which one we can throw the furthest.
[00:15.940 --> 00:16.800]  And then Andrews.
[00:16.840 --> 00:17.980]  And then also Andrews.
[00:18.260 --> 00:20.880]  And we've gotten four of each of these fruits.
[00:21.420 --> 00:22.620]  And this bread is for later.
[00:22.860 --> 00:23.460]  So, hang on.
[00:23.460 --> 00:24.960]  We're not wasting this fruit.
[00:25.160 --> 00:26.240]  Nick and I are going to eat it.
[00:26.280 --> 00:27.160]  We already discussed it.
[00:27.220 --> 00:28.560]  It's going to be bruised, but we don't care.
[00:28.560 --> 00:30.740]  I'm going to try and eat anything without a tire mark on it.
[00:30.940 --> 00:32.160]  This is Gavin's fruit.
[00:32.540 --> 00:33.340]  Ooh, the kiwi.
[00:33.500 --> 00:34.380]  You want to explain the kiwi?
[00:34.540 --> 00:35.640]  The kiwi is a fruit.
[00:36.100 --> 00:39.700]  I think it's nice and small and dense and can potentially go the distance.
[00:40.060 --> 00:42.520]  It is a little bit cross-windy here today.
[00:42.620 --> 00:44.680]  So, I think that's going to affect the kiwi.
[00:45.860 --> 00:46.260]  Alright.
[00:46.560 --> 00:47.320]  It's long-ish.
[00:47.320 --> 00:48.200]  Let's get started.
[00:48.340 --> 00:49.420]  Oh, we're going to start...
[00:49.420 --> 00:50.680]  Oh, we're going to start with the first...
[00:50.680 --> 00:52.280]  I thought we were going to show them all.
[00:52.600 --> 00:53.520]  Jesus Christ.
[00:53.740 --> 00:54.240]  Alright, fine.
[00:55.120 --> 00:55.840]  Nick's apples.
[00:55.840 --> 00:57.860]  I got apples, but I went smart and picked my 40.
[00:58.600 --> 00:59.320]  I got a kid.
[01:00.120 --> 01:00.660]  Thanks, Eric.
[01:01.500 --> 01:01.860]  Avocados.
[01:02.080 --> 01:03.500]  I think it's the right...
[01:03.500 --> 01:06.000]  I think these are the right density, the right size.
[01:06.260 --> 01:07.380]  I feel good about this.
[01:07.860 --> 01:11.000]  Here's Geoff, who's crying about us throwing these.
[01:11.160 --> 01:13.080]  Not confident in his pick in the slightest.
[01:13.220 --> 01:13.720]  Well, I just...
[01:13.720 --> 01:14.500]  I picked up a pear.
[01:14.800 --> 01:15.680]  And it was so...
[01:15.680 --> 01:16.160]  He messed with his head.
[01:16.180 --> 01:18.480]  He took the pear off the pick of the oranges and he was...
[01:18.480 --> 01:19.940]  He talked about it the whole way back.
[01:20.240 --> 01:22.940]  Finally, Andrew's pick...
[01:22.940 --> 01:23.560]  Dragon fruit.
[01:23.800 --> 01:24.560]  Dragon fruit?
[01:25.900 --> 01:28.140]  I think these are going to be all drag.
[01:28.260 --> 01:29.000]  This is all Eric.
[01:29.400 --> 01:29.600]  Yeah.
[01:30.060 --> 01:31.180]  These are terrible, right?
[01:31.600 --> 01:33.240]  So, how do we start? Let's start.
[01:33.980 --> 01:35.640]  Who wants to go first?
[01:35.700 --> 01:36.240]  Gavin wants to go first.
[01:36.800 --> 01:37.600]  I will go first.
[01:37.780 --> 01:38.740]  You're all throwing, not just...
[01:38.740 --> 01:40.240]  I thought it was Gavin would throw his.
[01:40.460 --> 01:41.400]  Yeah, this is Gavin's pick.
[01:41.620 --> 01:41.840]  We're all...
[01:45.320 --> 01:46.480]  Scientifically, here's the thing.
[01:46.600 --> 01:48.880]  If I threw my avocado max effort...
[01:49.500 --> 01:54.480]  If I threw my avocado max effort and then everyone's trying to do their max effort, it's different.
[01:54.940 --> 01:57.140]  We throw different distances.
[01:57.580 --> 01:58.320]  Is there a guy in that pickup?
[01:58.900 --> 02:00.140]  No, but I'm worried about the pickup.
[02:01.020 --> 02:02.300]  What, you think he's going to get it?
[02:02.440 --> 02:03.160]  Not from him.
[02:03.400 --> 02:03.520]  Okay.
[02:04.020 --> 02:04.780]  Whoa, okay.
[02:06.420 --> 02:07.120]  Alright, you ready, Jack?
[02:07.140 --> 02:07.340]  Yeah.
[02:07.880 --> 02:08.660]  Alright, go for it.
[02:08.900 --> 02:09.420]  Everyone good?
[02:09.600 --> 02:09.760]  Yep.
[02:15.370 --> 02:15.690]  Okay.
[02:18.430 --> 02:19.910]  Is it where it lands or where it bounced?
[02:20.030 --> 02:21.530]  I think it's about where it lands.
[02:21.710 --> 02:22.550]  I think it's good.
[02:22.630 --> 02:24.130]  Alright, so who's next in the game?
[02:24.130 --> 02:26.330]  Should he stand next to his so we don't get him from James?
[02:26.350 --> 02:27.730]  No, because I'm going to hit him with a kiwi.
[02:27.930 --> 02:29.150]  Nick, you're next.
[02:29.150 --> 02:29.270]  I'll be able to dodge it.
[02:29.890 --> 02:30.790]  You think I can't dodge a kiwi?
[02:30.790 --> 02:32.030]  I think you shouldn't dodge a kiwi.
[02:32.150 --> 02:33.010]  Don't go out there.
[02:33.510 --> 02:34.190]  Stay here.
[02:35.870 --> 02:36.870]  Nick, you go.
[02:37.710 --> 02:38.750]  Gotta keep an eye on it from here.
[02:38.930 --> 02:39.150]  Okay.
[02:39.870 --> 02:42.050]  Who's going to know whose kiwi is whose?
[02:42.370 --> 02:43.470]  It's going to be so much more complicated.
[02:44.390 --> 02:44.710]  Nice.
[02:44.890 --> 02:46.210]  He threw it exactly where mine is.
[02:47.150 --> 02:47.450]  Okay.
[02:47.630 --> 02:48.670]  Oh wow, it fell real short.
[02:49.030 --> 02:49.390]  Eric?
[02:49.550 --> 02:49.750]  Okay.
[02:50.550 --> 02:53.250]  I'm not feeling the passion for these kiwis with the other throwers.
[02:54.170 --> 02:55.190]  That was a warm-up throw.
[02:55.250 --> 02:55.670]  Sorry, Gavin.
[02:56.510 --> 02:57.210]  Oh, look at that.
[02:57.250 --> 02:57.970]  You got a spiral.
[02:58.490 --> 02:58.770]  Okay.
[02:59.070 --> 03:00.110]  Okay, I feel good about that.
[03:01.810 --> 03:03.150]  It's about where I would send a kiwi.
[03:03.370 --> 03:05.930]  I felt guilty for a second, but then I remember Gavin had a run start.
[03:06.730 --> 03:06.890]  Yep.
[03:07.550 --> 03:08.930]  Well, I mean, I pre-asked.
[03:11.050 --> 03:11.690]  Pretty good.
[03:11.990 --> 03:12.730]  Not bad.
[03:13.510 --> 03:14.590]  Oh, very nice.
[03:14.690 --> 03:18.210]  Okay, so we're seeing kiwi is all kind of in like that red bunch, right?
[03:18.750 --> 03:19.370]  Let's go look.
[03:19.530 --> 03:23.110]  And then we'll leave the top kiwi to see how it compares with the rest of the fruits.
[03:23.110 --> 03:24.230]  We'll leave the top of each one.
[03:25.030 --> 03:26.070]  See, because now we have...
[03:26.070 --> 03:26.350]  Because this is our average.
[03:26.450 --> 03:29.490]  Yeah, there's like a little bit of a barometer here where we go, oh, okay.
[03:29.650 --> 03:30.690]  This is our data pool.
[03:30.770 --> 03:31.370]  Yeah, this is the data pool.
[03:31.370 --> 03:33.390]  We should probably attach all these with string for some reason.
[03:33.510 --> 03:35.710]  I think Gavin won the throw.
[03:35.930 --> 03:36.390]  It's pretty good.
[03:36.390 --> 03:38.410]  I mean, it rolled pretty good, but I got no problem with that.
[03:38.590 --> 03:41.130]  So Gavin's is the furthest.
[03:41.470 --> 03:41.730]  Okay.
[03:42.530 --> 03:42.810]  All right.
[03:43.130 --> 03:43.710]  Is that mine or yours?
[03:43.790 --> 03:44.170]  This is mine.
[03:44.230 --> 03:44.430]  Okay.
[03:45.630 --> 03:47.210]  So we have two bars so that we can eat them?
[03:47.290 --> 03:47.570]  Yeah.
[03:47.950 --> 03:48.890]  And we're not throwing them away?
[03:48.970 --> 03:49.110]  Yeah.
[03:49.110 --> 03:50.110]  Oh, this is still...
[03:51.150 --> 03:51.970]  This is still great.
[03:57.560 --> 03:58.220]  Kiwi, bud.
[04:01.720 --> 04:02.760]  It tastes good.
[04:03.140 --> 04:03.300]  Yeah.
[04:03.500 --> 04:04.080]  That tastes real good.
[04:04.340 --> 04:04.920]  It's kiwi, it's kiwi.
[04:05.040 --> 04:05.800]  Kiwi is actually really good.
[04:05.960 --> 04:06.760]  Mmm, that is good.
[04:06.920 --> 04:07.080]  Yeah.
[04:07.400 --> 04:08.920]  How do you feel about Gavin having the best throw?
[04:09.160 --> 04:09.320]  Weird.
[04:09.560 --> 04:10.200]  Yeah, I don't like that.
[04:10.500 --> 04:14.220]  Geoff, do you think because you're the fifth thing to throw, yours is going to be inherently
[04:14.220 --> 04:16.820]  weaker because of what, tired arms?
[04:17.420 --> 04:17.680]  No.
[04:18.200 --> 04:18.520]  Okay.
[04:19.360 --> 04:21.000]  I think we're going to have warmed up arms.
[04:21.320 --> 04:24.020]  So next up is Nick, and Nick, we're doing apples?
[04:24.320 --> 04:24.680]  Apples!
[04:24.680 --> 04:25.720]  Decent size.
[04:25.920 --> 04:26.440]  All right, ready?
[04:26.740 --> 04:27.420]  Whenever you're ready.
[04:27.960 --> 04:28.040]  Got it.
[04:28.220 --> 04:29.140]  Nick's got his bicep out.
[04:29.460 --> 04:29.580]  Yep.
[04:29.720 --> 04:30.700]  Oh, look at that.
[04:33.900 --> 04:34.940]  Oh, pieces of it.
[04:35.040 --> 04:35.480]  Oh, wow.
[04:35.720 --> 04:36.140]  That's pretty good.
[04:36.220 --> 04:36.680]  All right.
[04:37.120 --> 04:37.820]  How does that work?
[04:37.880 --> 04:40.340]  Do we just go with the furthest piece or the biggest chunk?
[04:40.720 --> 04:41.740]  Oh, that's a good question.
[04:41.800 --> 04:43.640]  I think it's going to be the main apple chunk.
[04:43.640 --> 04:44.000]  I agree.
[04:44.080 --> 04:44.300]  The core.
[04:44.560 --> 04:44.680]  Yep.
[04:45.220 --> 04:45.900]  Mine next?
[04:46.520 --> 04:47.480]  No, it's Eric next.
[04:48.200 --> 04:49.140]  I don't know how it works either.
[04:49.700 --> 04:50.380]  Egg, egg.
[04:50.680 --> 04:51.920]  It's the season's thing to me.
[04:51.940 --> 04:52.380]  Nick, Eric.
[04:52.500 --> 04:53.680]  It's the season's thing to me.
[04:54.440 --> 04:55.200]  Season 98.
[04:55.340 --> 04:56.680]  Go for it.
[05:00.470 --> 05:00.870]  Man.
[05:01.170 --> 05:02.430]  Oh, it exploded.
[05:02.670 --> 05:04.250]  I hope that's the most, the biggest piece.
[05:05.270 --> 05:07.150]  Now, look at the effort that Geoff puts into this.
[05:09.610 --> 05:10.450]  Oh, pretty good.
[05:12.710 --> 05:13.110]  Nice.
[05:13.110 --> 05:13.810]  Jesus Christ.
[05:13.950 --> 05:14.170]  Right, Gavin?
[05:15.290 --> 05:16.570]  I think it rolled backwards.
[05:21.150 --> 05:21.950]  This sucks.
[05:22.450 --> 05:24.170]  He's doing a Stuart the Bumbler bit.
[05:24.870 --> 05:26.050]  I'll do it proper.
[05:26.270 --> 05:27.850]  He's doing Stuart the Bumbler.
[05:28.070 --> 05:29.150]  I'll do it proper.
[05:30.350 --> 05:30.610]  Alright.
[05:30.750 --> 05:31.390]  Here, let me get out of your way.
[05:31.690 --> 05:33.110]  Did you see how I got jacked like a dog?
[05:33.170 --> 05:33.850]  Oh, yeah, it's awesome.
[05:35.870 --> 05:36.550]  Alright, here we go.
[05:36.670 --> 05:37.530]  Like a dog.
[05:40.590 --> 05:41.450]  Oh, it's slippery.
[05:43.490 --> 05:44.650]  I'm replacing the egg.
[05:44.950 --> 05:44.970]  Fuck.
[05:45.250 --> 05:46.050]  I'm replacing the egg.
[05:46.350 --> 05:48.810]  I mean, replacing the egg.
[05:49.370 --> 05:50.430]  What is this?
[05:52.010 --> 05:52.810]  Oh, shit.
[05:57.850 --> 05:59.150]  Alright, so Kiwi's winning.
[06:00.870 --> 06:02.090]  We can go have a look.
[06:02.410 --> 06:04.510]  I think Kiwi's in first still.
[06:05.790 --> 06:06.590]  That was...
[06:06.590 --> 06:09.730]  Those apples exploded way harder than I expected.
[06:09.890 --> 06:11.130]  They're gonna be hot if you snack on.
[06:11.570 --> 06:13.810]  This got close, but that's not the core.
[06:14.010 --> 06:14.290]  No.
[06:14.530 --> 06:15.810]  I think this is it right here.
[06:16.430 --> 06:16.990]  There's that.
[06:17.090 --> 06:18.510]  I think it's more...
[06:18.510 --> 06:19.530]  I'm over there.
[06:19.650 --> 06:19.810]  Right.
[06:20.010 --> 06:20.850]  I think this is it.
[06:21.250 --> 06:22.030]  What do you think?
[06:22.090 --> 06:22.770]  I mean, there's Kiwi.
[06:23.370 --> 06:26.950]  I will say Kiwi rolled a lot, and we're judging it on roll, which is...
[06:26.950 --> 06:28.550]  Nice for the Kiwi, I suppose.
[06:28.810 --> 06:30.750]  But that should have been taken into account, I guess, when we picked up the fruit.
[06:30.770 --> 06:32.270]  Yeah, you know what can't roll? An exploding apple.
[06:32.810 --> 06:33.370]  That's true.
[06:33.530 --> 06:34.550]  The apple just...
[06:34.550 --> 06:35.230]  That's on me.
[06:35.330 --> 06:35.830]  It exploded.
[06:35.890 --> 06:37.490]  Did you think it was going to explode like that?
[06:37.670 --> 06:37.870]  No.
[06:38.010 --> 06:38.350]  Me neither.
[06:38.530 --> 06:41.350]  So Gavin's got the furthest and the furthest fruit so far.
[06:41.830 --> 06:43.190]  Are we gonna make a smoothie out of this later?
[06:43.410 --> 06:43.590]  Yeah.
[06:44.850 --> 06:45.590]  Mine is avocado.
[06:45.990 --> 06:46.310]  Okay.
[06:46.910 --> 06:48.370]  I think avocado has...
[06:48.370 --> 06:49.230]  I think it's the right size.
[06:49.310 --> 06:50.090]  I think it's the right weight.
[06:50.970 --> 06:52.750]  I think avocado feels good.
[06:53.010 --> 06:54.910]  Are you gonna try a spiral or just fucking...
[06:54.910 --> 06:56.450]  No, I think I'm just whipping it, you know?
[06:56.450 --> 06:57.330]  Just fork it, yeah.
[06:57.530 --> 06:58.350]  This is gonna win.
[06:58.630 --> 06:59.510]  I'm gonna Raleigh fingers.
[06:59.630 --> 07:00.210]  I think it will.
[07:00.430 --> 07:01.330]  At least it's gonna roll, too.
[07:01.350 --> 07:01.690]  I think that's it.
[07:01.710 --> 07:02.550]  I didn't think there was some...
[07:02.550 --> 07:03.110]  I think I might...
[07:03.530 --> 07:03.850]  Spherical.
[07:04.230 --> 07:06.030]  Could give it like a little bit of a...
[07:06.030 --> 07:06.950]  Well, I don't wanna change up.
[07:07.050 --> 07:07.510]  Yeah, nah.
[07:07.690 --> 07:07.910]  No.
[07:08.130 --> 07:08.790]  This is hot.
[07:08.950 --> 07:09.390]  All right, here we go.
[07:09.890 --> 07:10.530]  34 degrees.
[07:11.050 --> 07:12.150]  It's 34 degrees.
[07:12.450 --> 07:12.570]  Okay.
[07:14.930 --> 07:16.130]  Oh, he runs on this one.
[07:16.790 --> 07:17.530]  Look at that.
[07:17.890 --> 07:18.750]  Oh, that's a good throw.
[07:18.910 --> 07:19.630]  That's a great throw.
[07:19.690 --> 07:20.370]  Look at that roll.
[07:20.390 --> 07:20.830]  Oh, look at that roll.
[07:20.870 --> 07:21.510]  He knew.
[07:22.190 --> 07:22.990]  Look at it roll.
[07:23.090 --> 07:23.850]  Look at that donkey roll.
[07:23.850 --> 07:26.750]  Here comes Geoff.
[07:26.910 --> 07:27.330]  Hit it, Geoff.
[07:32.570 --> 07:33.470]  Oh, what a spiral.
[07:34.330 --> 07:34.870]  Oh, damn.
[07:35.170 --> 07:35.710]  Oh, no.
[07:35.730 --> 07:37.170]  Blowing the kiwi away, huh?
[07:37.270 --> 07:38.470]  Both have beaten the kiwi.
[07:38.510 --> 07:39.130]  That's crazy.
[07:39.270 --> 07:40.710]  Kiwi just dead last.
[07:41.210 --> 07:41.970]  Is it...
[07:41.970 --> 07:42.850]  Oh, no.
[07:46.430 --> 07:47.270]  Go left.
[07:47.430 --> 07:47.890]  Go left.
[07:49.050 --> 07:49.570]  Magnet.
[07:49.690 --> 07:50.070]  Yeah!
[07:50.730 --> 07:51.550]  All right, Gavin.
[07:51.850 --> 07:52.210]  Okay.
[07:52.210 --> 07:57.090]  Oh, God.
[07:57.150 --> 07:58.030]  What happened?
[07:59.170 --> 08:00.490]  It keeps slipping out.
[08:00.510 --> 08:01.190]  It still rolled.
[08:01.290 --> 08:01.690]  Look at it.
[08:02.390 --> 08:02.690]  Okay.
[08:03.710 --> 08:04.490]  Terrible throw.
[08:04.570 --> 08:05.190]  On purpose.
[08:05.890 --> 08:06.590]  Gavin's done.
[08:06.730 --> 08:07.310]  Nick, you ready?
[08:07.490 --> 08:07.990]  Yeah, I'm ready.
[08:08.170 --> 08:08.710]  Redemption throw.
[08:08.930 --> 08:09.330]  Here we go.
[08:10.530 --> 08:11.610]  Nick doesn't piss about.
[08:11.750 --> 08:12.290]  He just goes.
[08:13.210 --> 08:13.750]  Oh, wow.
[08:13.810 --> 08:14.570]  Look at that bounce.
[08:15.090 --> 08:16.190]  That might take it.
[08:16.810 --> 08:17.530]  Look at that.
[08:17.930 --> 08:17.990]  Wow!
[08:18.010 --> 08:19.330]  What have I done?
[08:19.790 --> 08:20.270]  All right.
[08:20.310 --> 08:21.670]  Well, let's just...
[08:21.670 --> 08:22.190]  Oh, no.
[08:22.190 --> 08:23.350]  Clearly, Nick's more...
[08:23.350 --> 08:23.890]  Nick...
[08:23.890 --> 08:25.630]  Do I have a look at the avocados?
[08:25.950 --> 08:26.730]  Fucking killed that.
[08:27.510 --> 08:28.030]  That's crazy.
[08:28.130 --> 08:29.990]  It's like it's the best fruit to throw.
[08:30.250 --> 08:31.370]  No, I wasn't trying before.
[08:31.550 --> 08:33.910]  Nick did me by like a hundred percent.
[08:35.430 --> 08:37.110]  Now, it was the roll.
[08:37.410 --> 08:38.590]  It was nothing else.
[08:39.110 --> 08:39.510]  We'll see.
[08:40.570 --> 08:42.330]  Nothing peels an avocado like the street.
[08:44.770 --> 08:46.050]  So, here's mine.
[08:46.450 --> 08:48.570]  See, all you want to avoid is that bit.
[08:48.970 --> 08:50.530]  God, it looks like the road rash to it.
[08:50.530 --> 08:52.570]  That's, you know, motor oil and bird shit.
[08:52.730 --> 08:55.090]  But the rest of it is pretty good.
[08:56.430 --> 08:57.190]  How, like...
[08:57.190 --> 08:58.150]  How does it do that?
[08:59.150 --> 08:59.610]  I don't know.
[08:59.650 --> 09:00.650]  It's just like road rash.
[09:00.810 --> 09:02.570]  Imagine falling off a motorcycle.
[09:03.370 --> 09:04.550]  You got street peeled as well?
[09:04.570 --> 09:05.170]  What are you doing?
[09:05.610 --> 09:06.190]  I'm just...
[09:06.190 --> 09:07.070]  It's right here.
[09:07.310 --> 09:07.690]  Whoa.
[09:07.730 --> 09:08.990]  We don't touch the winning roll.
[09:08.990 --> 09:09.290]  Did you see that?
[09:09.670 --> 09:10.690]  Did you see that?
[09:10.950 --> 09:12.670]  You get penalized at least 20 feet for that.
[09:12.690 --> 09:13.070]  Wow.
[09:13.530 --> 09:14.550]  I'm already lost by you.
[09:14.550 --> 09:16.030]  I was going to say, it's not going to...
[09:16.030 --> 09:17.210]  Dude, apples...
[09:17.210 --> 09:18.970]  I got to say, apples fucking suck.
[09:19.050 --> 09:20.030]  Yeah, they were pretty terrible.
[09:20.030 --> 09:20.390]  I'm telling you.
[09:20.550 --> 09:21.950]  Everyone says apple is their default.
[09:22.070 --> 09:23.130]  It's a bad fucking choice.
[09:23.490 --> 09:24.450]  Well, let's move to the next one.
[09:24.590 --> 09:24.890]  All right.
[09:24.910 --> 09:25.450]  Two more.
[09:25.670 --> 09:26.170]  Here we go.
[09:27.710 --> 09:28.770]  I have to wait for mine.
[09:28.910 --> 09:29.510]  All right, that's pretty good.
[09:30.610 --> 09:31.790]  I wish I liked avocado.
[09:31.990 --> 09:33.010]  Nick, you're going to have to eat my avocado.
[09:33.210 --> 09:33.430]  Okay.
[09:35.250 --> 09:35.890]  Nick can't wait.
[09:36.510 --> 09:37.910]  No hesitation on that one.
[09:38.230 --> 09:39.830]  Eating an avocado like an apple?
[09:40.470 --> 09:41.530]  This might be the new move.
[09:41.670 --> 09:42.810]  Why have I been dicking around with a knife all this time?
[09:42.810 --> 09:43.910]  Why am I cutting it?
[09:44.030 --> 09:44.930]  Throw it in the car park.
[09:45.150 --> 09:45.790]  This is it.
[09:46.590 --> 09:48.110]  Spike it against your kitchen ground.
[09:48.570 --> 09:49.250]  Open it up.
[09:49.250 --> 09:53.350]  It's like when you buy a bag of ice from the store and put it on the ground.
[09:53.650 --> 09:54.970]  Look at your kitchen ground.
[09:55.710 --> 09:56.430]  This is...
[09:57.250 --> 09:58.530]  This is fucking great.
[09:59.010 --> 10:03.190]  If nothing else came from this, I learned a new way to eat avocados that I'm super into.
[10:03.370 --> 10:04.510]  Are you eating down to the stone?
[10:05.790 --> 10:06.190]  Yeah.
[10:06.710 --> 10:09.010]  Are you stopping before you're getting to the stone?
[10:09.010 --> 10:09.430]  I just haven't got there.
[10:09.510 --> 10:10.150]  I was eating around.
[10:10.510 --> 10:10.710]  Oh.
[10:11.790 --> 10:12.490]  Yeah, I'm getting to the stone.
[10:13.070 --> 10:14.070]  It's fucking hot.
[10:14.350 --> 10:15.050]  It is.
[10:15.190 --> 10:15.370]  What?
[10:15.550 --> 10:16.470]  Don't bite into it.
[10:16.610 --> 10:17.190]  Got a bit of the label.
[10:19.510 --> 10:20.450]  All right, oranges.
[10:21.390 --> 10:21.750]  Ooh.
[10:22.370 --> 10:23.270]  I'll go first here.
[10:23.470 --> 10:24.210]  These have some heft.
[10:25.050 --> 10:26.290]  Geoff, how are you feeling about oranges?
[10:26.570 --> 10:27.030]  I feel pretty good.
[10:29.010 --> 10:30.530]  Oh, look at that!
[10:31.430 --> 10:31.830]  Wow.
[10:32.330 --> 10:33.450]  Oh, it was a split up.
[10:33.450 --> 10:34.730]  Now imagine if it stayed together.
[10:38.010 --> 10:38.410]  Gavin.
[10:38.830 --> 10:39.190]  I'm up?
[10:40.510 --> 10:41.010]  Wait, right?
[10:41.190 --> 10:41.530]  Gavin.
[10:41.710 --> 10:41.870]  Yeah.
[10:42.070 --> 10:42.370]  Oh, cool.
[10:42.530 --> 10:42.630]  Yeah.
[10:43.350 --> 10:44.790]  Well, I've seen how it splits.
[10:44.890 --> 10:45.110]  Uh-huh.
[10:45.670 --> 10:46.030]  It's Gavin.
[10:46.990 --> 10:48.030]  He's going to underhand your...
[10:48.890 --> 10:49.690]  This would count, right?
[10:49.870 --> 10:49.990]  Yeah.
[10:50.690 --> 10:52.210]  I don't know why you'd do it, but...
[10:52.210 --> 10:53.270]  Can you throw it like a cricket ball?
[10:54.270 --> 10:54.970]  Like a cricket bowler?
[10:55.090 --> 10:55.670]  Lock your elbow.
[10:55.870 --> 10:56.130]  Here we go.
[11:02.300 --> 11:02.640]  Okay.
[11:04.360 --> 11:04.920]  How's that?
[11:07.650 --> 11:08.830]  Hey, the match is over.
[11:08.950 --> 11:10.770]  Geoff just looked at it and went...
[11:10.770 --> 11:11.010]  Okay.
[11:12.290 --> 11:13.270]  You said do it like cricket.
[11:13.990 --> 11:14.390]  All right, you ready?
[11:14.590 --> 11:14.810]  Yep.
[11:19.640 --> 11:20.320]  You wish.
[11:21.980 --> 11:24.480]  Geoff, I'm telling you right now, I'm giving this everything I have.
[11:24.560 --> 11:25.160]  Because these guys aren't.
[11:25.360 --> 11:25.900]  No, they're not.
[11:26.040 --> 11:27.260]  I mean, I could do a prop one if you want.
[11:27.860 --> 11:28.700]  I was going to do a roll.
[11:29.000 --> 11:29.660]  Oh, that was it though.
[11:30.120 --> 11:31.040]  We don't have any more.
[11:31.560 --> 11:31.900]  All right.
[11:33.100 --> 11:34.760]  The point was buying four of them.
[11:34.840 --> 11:35.020]  Yeah.
[11:35.600 --> 11:36.680]  Four intact ones.
[11:36.980 --> 11:37.260]  Oh, yeah.
[11:39.880 --> 11:40.600]  All right, here we go.
[11:40.800 --> 11:41.520]  Oh, God.
[11:43.440 --> 11:44.080]  Good throw.
[11:44.200 --> 11:45.140]  Oh, look at that.
[11:46.880 --> 11:49.660]  The problem is that impact, done.
[11:49.660 --> 11:50.980]  What a thwop.
[11:51.500 --> 11:52.240]  It's done.
[11:53.140 --> 11:54.580]  I mean, I threw the orange the farthest.
[11:54.640 --> 11:55.980]  I feel pretty manly about that.
[11:56.520 --> 11:58.000]  It looks like it's been shot.
[11:58.100 --> 12:01.040]  Yeah, so specifically this was blood orange, right?
[12:01.040 --> 12:04.220]  Oh, thank God, because I was really worried for a second there.
[12:04.220 --> 12:06.240]  I thought this is what happens when you just cricket a regular orange.
[12:07.960 --> 12:09.840]  So now we just...
[12:09.840 --> 12:12.720]  I mean, unless dragon fruit provides different...
[12:13.720 --> 12:15.060]  This is the furthest one.
[12:18.590 --> 12:20.050]  I mean, it went further than apple.
[12:22.050 --> 12:22.930]  Almost tied kiwi.
[12:23.030 --> 12:23.790]  Almost tied kiwi.
[12:24.050 --> 12:25.830]  Not even fucking close to avocado.
[12:26.050 --> 12:27.130]  Not even close to avocado.
[12:28.010 --> 12:29.150]  I'm really sorry, guys.
[12:29.310 --> 12:31.150]  It feels good. Yeah, it feels good to be right. Absolutely.
[12:31.570 --> 12:36.130]  When you know you're right, and then everyone else has to fucking suck it, and they tell you that you're right.
[12:36.550 --> 12:36.690]  It's great.
[12:36.910 --> 12:39.190]  I feel like I wasn't far off with the kiwi.
[12:39.990 --> 12:42.590]  Congratulations on being the least wrong, I guess.
[12:43.750 --> 12:45.890]  Hey, let's go see what Andrew's is all about.
[12:46.130 --> 12:47.570]  Let's go throw a dragon fruit.
[12:47.750 --> 12:48.350]  The most wrong.
[12:49.650 --> 12:51.130]  Throwing a dragon fruit.
[12:51.730 --> 12:52.730]  Oh, that's good orange.
[12:53.110 --> 12:58.370]  Eric, if you had to change fruits, if you couldn't pick guacamole... guacamole... avocado...
[12:58.370 --> 12:59.670]  It became guacamole.
[13:00.450 --> 13:02.370]  Well, and, you know, something that we haven't thrown today.
[13:02.470 --> 13:03.790]  What would you select?
[13:04.150 --> 13:04.490]  Is avocado a fruit?
[13:05.030 --> 13:05.210]  Yeah.
[13:06.550 --> 13:08.490]  I would say probably a lemon.
[13:08.890 --> 13:14.570]  I know that Geoff is very into pears, but I do think that a lemon is going to give you...
[13:14.570 --> 13:16.610]  See, I'm concerned with, like, the grip on the outside.
[13:16.610 --> 13:21.250]  And a lemon gives you a little bit of that... like an avocado skin. It's got, like, a little bit of grip.
[13:21.450 --> 13:24.050]  I don't know. I've never had a dragon fruit, so I have no idea how it's going to work.
[13:24.690 --> 13:27.130]  Eric, by the way, the correct answer was lime. You want to go with a lime.
[13:27.170 --> 13:28.070]  Lime's too small.
[13:28.290 --> 13:29.430]  But lime's not going to break apart.
[13:29.670 --> 13:30.970]  This is Andrew's pick.
[13:31.190 --> 13:32.330]  Hmm, this is ganeg.
[13:32.690 --> 13:33.270]  All right, man.
[13:33.630 --> 13:34.850]  And now no modifications, right?
[13:34.850 --> 13:35.370]  No modifications.
[13:35.690 --> 13:36.690]  But I'm going to sort of, like...
[13:37.310 --> 13:39.750]  You can tip your little flaps up. That's fine.
[13:39.950 --> 13:43.890]  Yeah, I'm going to... hopefully get a little string going like a vortex.
[13:43.890 --> 13:46.010]  There's just no way. This is such a bad... this is a bad one.
[13:46.010 --> 13:46.910]  This is not good.
[13:47.510 --> 13:50.090]  He thinks it's going to nerf vortex and go...
[13:50.090 --> 13:51.290]  It's not going to fucking do it.
[13:52.190 --> 13:52.570]  All right, here we go.
[13:52.670 --> 13:54.310]  I also don't know how to spin like a football.
[13:54.490 --> 13:56.010]  You just got to put your laces...
[13:56.970 --> 14:00.130]  I can't play you with frisbee. I can't translate that into any of this.
[14:00.430 --> 14:00.750]  It's true.
[14:00.970 --> 14:01.370]  Laces out.
[14:01.570 --> 14:02.150]  Okay, here we go.
[14:04.910 --> 14:05.270]  Lizard.
[14:06.090 --> 14:07.630]  Oh, look! You got a bad spiral.
[14:08.490 --> 14:09.590]  That was a terrible spiral.
[14:10.530 --> 14:11.250]  I mean...
[14:11.250 --> 14:14.090]  Now this is going to be a bad spiral.
[14:14.090 --> 14:16.030]  I wonder if I'm going to...
[14:16.030 --> 14:17.350]  That was a good spiral.
[14:17.690 --> 14:18.670]  There's no ceremony with Nick. He just goes up.
[14:18.770 --> 14:19.170]  Oh!
[14:20.190 --> 14:21.930]  Nick effortlessly just goes right over mine.
[14:21.930 --> 14:23.870]  He's a sports guy. Nick's the most regular guy here.
[14:24.090 --> 14:25.250]  I threw so hard at my arm.
[14:25.470 --> 14:26.410]  I also hurt my arm.
[14:26.790 --> 14:27.130]  Here we go.
[14:29.250 --> 14:29.650]  Eric!
[14:29.830 --> 14:30.850]  Oh, that was terrible.
[14:31.170 --> 14:32.590]  That was a me round two.
[14:32.590 --> 14:33.030]  That was awful.
[14:33.230 --> 14:35.070]  That went end over end. That's so hard.
[14:35.250 --> 14:35.570]  Here we go.
[14:35.730 --> 14:36.630]  I had a decent spiral.
[14:37.870 --> 14:38.670]  Here comes Geoffrey.
[14:40.250 --> 14:41.470]  Oh, look at that!
[14:42.310 --> 14:44.970]  They all went to about the same place.
[14:45.290 --> 14:45.310]  Yeah.
[14:45.450 --> 14:48.570]  And that place was way shorter than everyone else.
[14:48.690 --> 14:49.030]  Yeah.
[14:49.090 --> 14:51.710]  What we should have done is get a drone and heat map the area.
[14:51.950 --> 14:54.190]  What have we learned from our experiment?
[14:54.770 --> 14:56.850]  I'll let everyone else say it, but...
[14:56.850 --> 14:57.330]  I mean, go ahead.
[14:57.550 --> 14:58.290]  Dragon fruit's bad.
[14:58.490 --> 14:59.130]  Dragon fruit sucks.
[14:59.250 --> 15:00.290]  Yeah, that's what I learned.
[15:00.290 --> 15:00.790]  And what else?
[15:02.350 --> 15:05.470]  There's a lot of other fruits that have varying...
[15:07.470 --> 15:08.190]  I don't know.
[15:08.770 --> 15:09.410]  Wind resistance?
[15:09.530 --> 15:09.730]  Yeah.
[15:09.730 --> 15:10.770]  Very impactful.
[15:12.110 --> 15:13.070]  Oh, look at that.
[15:13.850 --> 15:14.490]  Oh, my!
[15:14.930 --> 15:16.230]  There's some yummy dragon fruit in there.
[15:17.510 --> 15:17.950]  That's pretty good.
[15:20.030 --> 15:20.470]  Want some?
[15:21.390 --> 15:22.110]  Hang on, hold it up.
[15:23.730 --> 15:24.670]  Looks like sticky rice.
[15:24.850 --> 15:26.630]  Yeah, it'd be good for a thumbnail.
[15:26.870 --> 15:27.570]  Wait, hang on.
[15:27.870 --> 15:28.730]  I'll get all you guys right there.
[15:30.090 --> 15:32.370]  What was that movie where he's eating rice and it turns to maggots?
[15:32.370 --> 15:33.370]  No, no, no, this is just to get a thumbnail.
[15:33.490 --> 15:33.850]  Alright, here's a good one.
[15:34.430 --> 15:35.150]  Like Lost Boys?
[15:35.270 --> 15:35.810]  Yeah, Lost Boys.
[15:35.910 --> 15:36.150]  Right there?
[15:37.650 --> 15:38.830]  That's pretty good, even off the floor.
[15:38.830 --> 15:39.370]  Yeah.
[15:39.910 --> 15:41.010]  As far as floor food goes.
[15:41.570 --> 15:42.570]  So do we want to do a ranking?
[15:42.730 --> 15:43.270]  Do we want to do...
[15:43.270 --> 15:44.230]  We have stairs over there.
[15:44.230 --> 15:45.110]  Yeah, number one is avocado.
[15:46.030 --> 15:47.030]  Here we have a podium.
[15:47.230 --> 15:47.670]  We have a podium.
[15:47.790 --> 15:48.310]  Oh, that's...
[15:48.310 --> 15:48.910]  Oh, this is good.
[15:50.250 --> 15:50.610]  Alright.
[15:50.810 --> 15:52.070]  Go grab your fruit.
[15:52.290 --> 15:53.210]  Oh, that's great.
[15:53.410 --> 15:54.490]  That's such a good idea.
[15:54.890 --> 15:55.250]  Hang on.
[15:55.350 --> 15:55.830]  I'll take one of those.
[15:55.830 --> 15:56.130]  Hang on.
[15:56.250 --> 15:57.130]  I'll be back.
[15:57.550 --> 15:57.930]  Hang on.
[15:57.950 --> 15:58.870]  You want some dragon fruit?
[15:59.490 --> 16:00.130]  Hang on, guys.
[16:00.170 --> 16:00.430]  Wait.
[16:00.710 --> 16:02.950]  So dragon fruit will be on the floor next to the podium.
[16:04.010 --> 16:05.150]  Alright, we'll just...
[16:06.630 --> 16:07.650]  What was fourth?
[16:07.650 --> 16:10.110]  Fourth was the orange, I think.
[16:10.330 --> 16:11.470]  It was the orange.
[16:13.750 --> 16:14.770]  Next is the apple.
[16:15.270 --> 16:16.110]  Or what's left of it.
[16:16.650 --> 16:17.270]  The kiwi.
[16:20.290 --> 16:23.750]  In first place...
[16:25.220 --> 16:26.160]  The mighty avocado.
[16:26.180 --> 16:27.620]  Get a good photo of that for the thumbnail.
[16:27.740 --> 16:27.940]  Got it.
[16:28.240 --> 16:29.640]  We can't show it on the...
[16:29.640 --> 16:30.620]  We'll just blur it.
[16:30.720 --> 16:31.200]  We'll blur it.
[16:31.560 --> 16:33.980]  And then we should all stand there holding our fruit on each step.
[16:34.220 --> 16:35.680]  Like a medal ceremony.
[16:35.760 --> 16:35.940]  Okay.
[16:36.320 --> 16:37.080]  Alright, let's get up there.
[16:42.810 --> 16:43.170]  Okay.
[16:48.300 --> 16:49.660]  Ignore the dragon fruit.
[16:49.900 --> 16:50.620]  This was a good test.
[16:52.320 --> 16:53.060]  What have we learned?
[16:53.940 --> 16:56.700]  Mike is whistling the song.
[16:57.440 --> 16:58.100]  We can't use that.
[16:58.420 --> 16:59.020]  We can't use that.
[16:59.180 --> 17:01.440]  Well, actually, with the way he's whistling it, we can use that.
[17:01.860 --> 17:02.120]  Yeah, we can.
[17:02.200 --> 17:02.620]  It was love.
[17:07.300 --> 17:08.200]  Oh, my phone!
