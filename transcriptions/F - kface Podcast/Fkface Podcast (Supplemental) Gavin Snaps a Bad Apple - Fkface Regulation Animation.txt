[00:00.000 --> 00:06.400]  I just had probably the shortest duration f*** face, the most instant f*** face that I've ever
[00:06.400 --> 00:14.700]  experienced. Go on. I was in bed, uh, trying to watch, um, not to talk about Bo Burnham again,
[00:14.880 --> 00:20.480]  but I was trying to watch his show that just went on Netflix from ages ago, uh, with Beck.
[00:20.580 --> 00:27.880]  And the Apple TV remote is an utter piece of shit. I don't know if you've experienced this turd.
[00:27.880 --> 00:33.780]  Um, I've had so many experiences where like the skip ahead 10 seconds and the skip back 10 seconds
[00:33.780 --> 00:37.900]  on the, on the time on the, on the sides, just stopped working after a while. Like I've, I've
[00:37.900 --> 00:43.780]  had these replaced before. I'm at, I'm at the point with this one where I'm just like, this is so bad.
[00:44.140 --> 00:48.360]  You, so the clicks on the side stop working. So it doesn't skip back 10 seconds each time.
[00:48.480 --> 00:53.820]  So you end up trying to actually like manually moving the play head on a video around that it
[00:53.820 --> 00:58.060]  skipping all over the place and I'm getting annoyed. I'm like, it's a shitty thing. And Meg's
[00:58.060 --> 01:02.240]  laughing at me because I complain about this damn thing constantly. So she's making fun of me that
[01:02.240 --> 01:08.800]  I just don't do anything about it. Um, and I like to do things just rad. Like I like to surprise Meg
[01:08.800 --> 01:14.560]  in quite extreme ways. Sometimes, for example, she recently told me, um, that I've been wearing
[01:14.560 --> 01:18.040]  a shirt too long. Cause it had that hole in it and she's been staring at this hole for years.
[01:18.100 --> 01:22.500]  So I just put my finger through it and just tore the shirt off my body. Like I hulked out of it
[01:22.500 --> 01:26.200]  and she thought that was funny. So I thought, you know, I'm going to, I'm going to do something
[01:26.200 --> 01:30.920]  about this Apple remote. So in the middle of the conversation of me complaining about this Apple
[01:30.920 --> 01:38.280]  remote, I just out of nowhere snapped it in half. I just snapped it right down the middle. And what
[01:38.280 --> 01:46.880]  it felt like was that someone threw a cup of sand in my face. And then I just heard what sounded like
[01:46.880 --> 01:52.960]  raining all over both of us and the bed. Turns out they're made of glass.
[01:54.460 --> 02:05.580]  The whole thing is glass. I shot tiny shards of glass into my eyes and face all over both of us
[02:06.780 --> 02:15.240]  raining down on the entire bedroom at like 11 PM. And I've just sat there with glass in my
[02:15.240 --> 02:20.580]  hair and my chest hair in my, in my cup of tea on my nightstand.
[02:27.200 --> 02:31.200]  So I'm like, wow, one actual definition of face.
[02:31.320 --> 02:36.740]  I shot myself in the foot because just for a joke, what an idiot.
[02:38.860 --> 02:43.560]  Whoa. You want to see where that clip's from? And, uh, all the other clips that you're going
[02:43.560 --> 02:48.400]  be seeing with the new F*** Face regulation animation, subscribe to F*** Face, the podcast,
