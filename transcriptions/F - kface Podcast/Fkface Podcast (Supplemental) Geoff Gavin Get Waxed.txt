[00:00.000 --> 00:03.260]  This is Gavin, he's also going to be waxed, and he said it's going to feel good.
[00:03.340 --> 00:03.940]  I need a plug.
[00:04.140 --> 00:08.220]  Okay, you can plug it in, vacuum over there, or over here.
[00:08.280 --> 00:09.400]  There's also one over there.
[00:09.480 --> 00:12.060]  Can y'all treat Shane, or Trim, or anything?
[00:12.120 --> 00:12.640]  Absolutely not.
[00:15.920 --> 00:16.800]  I didn't think about that.
[00:16.940 --> 00:17.460]  That embarrasses me.
[00:17.480 --> 00:19.040]  Wait, so, wait, who's going first?
[00:19.520 --> 00:20.260]  Geoff, you're going first?
[00:20.820 --> 00:22.960]  According to Gavin, I am. I thought he would go first.
[00:23.600 --> 00:24.860]  I think Gavin should go first, too.
[00:25.260 --> 00:27.540]  Ah, you know, I got stabbed this morning by a camera and all that.
[00:27.740 --> 00:28.560]  What does that mean?
[00:28.700 --> 00:29.260]  What does that...
[00:29.260 --> 00:32.540]  So we'll have this thing to put your guys' face through.
[00:33.460 --> 00:36.500]  And we'll modify how we see fit, as we need.
[00:36.860 --> 00:40.360]  And then let's not forget to film around this mirror.
[00:40.760 --> 00:41.460]  Oh, yeah.
[00:42.220 --> 00:43.140]  Show a lot of anus.
[00:43.440 --> 00:44.740]  No, I'm not going to show that.
[00:45.120 --> 00:45.980]  I don't want to tag it out.
[00:46.080 --> 00:47.260]  We can just do it instead of talking.
[00:47.800 --> 00:48.460]  This is your idea.
[00:48.700 --> 00:48.860]  Oh, yeah.
[00:49.020 --> 00:49.660]  In the trash can.
[00:49.740 --> 00:50.820]  You want to know the experience.
[00:51.800 --> 00:53.360]  You can't have an issue with this.
[00:54.060 --> 00:55.580]  I'm only agreeing with this because you...
[00:56.320 --> 00:57.160]  Said it would feel good?
[00:57.160 --> 00:58.680]  Instituted the idea.
[00:59.340 --> 01:00.200]  Said it would feel good.
[01:00.380 --> 01:01.380]  She said it feels good.
[01:01.380 --> 01:01.500]  Oh.
[01:02.240 --> 01:03.220]  And she's a professional.
[01:03.460 --> 01:04.520]  No nerve endings.
[01:05.160 --> 01:05.640]  Oh.
[01:06.020 --> 01:06.400]  No what?
[01:06.420 --> 01:07.120]  No nerve endings.
[01:07.700 --> 01:10.460]  All the nerves really live in the stomach, like the abdomen.
[01:10.700 --> 01:12.780]  I saw some of the stuff I found up there before.
[01:12.820 --> 01:13.920]  It's just in the skin.
[01:14.580 --> 01:14.960]  Yeah.
[01:15.700 --> 01:20.540]  I heard that it feels... the hot wax feels so hot.
[01:20.860 --> 01:21.120]  Oh.
[01:21.900 --> 01:23.140]  Now that sounds relaxing.
[01:25.540 --> 01:27.880]  I'm so glad everybody made it.
[01:30.980 --> 01:32.960]  I really feel the support from everyone.
[01:33.080 --> 01:34.640]  Now I will say, I gave Gracie the option.
[01:34.720 --> 01:35.860]  I said, you don't have to come.
[01:35.940 --> 01:36.360]  It's fine.
[01:36.560 --> 01:38.440]  I don't want you putting me in a weird situation.
[01:38.860 --> 01:39.740]  Yeah, I won't mess it.
[01:39.820 --> 01:41.220]  No, and she said, no, I have to be there.
[01:42.120 --> 01:42.820]  I'm a team player.
[01:43.660 --> 01:44.340]  I'm professional.
[01:44.580 --> 01:47.720]  I do what it takes to get the job done.
[01:47.920 --> 01:48.760]  Day in, day out.
[01:48.840 --> 01:52.780]  I knew going forward that when Gavin presented it that it would never happen if I didn't
[01:52.780 --> 01:55.380]  attach myself to it because I know I'll see it through.
[01:55.900 --> 02:01.820]  And so I'm just following along with the, you know, my role in life.
[02:03.520 --> 02:04.440]  Keep them honest.
[02:05.120 --> 02:06.160]  I'm not a team player.
[02:06.800 --> 02:07.940]  I want to run away.
[02:08.400 --> 02:09.480]  I'm a little baby.
[02:10.380 --> 02:12.040]  Still kind of visible at anus height.
[02:12.460 --> 02:13.920]  It is a bit anus heighty.
[02:14.320 --> 02:15.220]  No, you're not going to see it.
[02:15.700 --> 02:16.700]  You're going to be on your back.
[02:16.860 --> 02:18.620]  See? It's fine.
[02:19.120 --> 02:21.400]  There's, there's debate on who goes first.
[02:21.900 --> 02:22.360]  Flip a coin.
[02:22.800 --> 02:24.120]  All right, you want to have a...
[02:24.120 --> 02:25.460]  What's the official N-Egg?
[02:26.540 --> 02:26.960]  Oh, yeah.
[02:27.040 --> 02:27.640]  I lost G.
[02:28.220 --> 02:28.580]  Uh-huh.
[02:28.680 --> 02:29.580]  You got a good footage, baby.
[02:30.660 --> 02:32.160]  I am not involved in this.
[02:34.520 --> 02:35.840]  You're the final G, yeah.
[02:36.180 --> 02:37.160]  Or Gagnag.
[02:37.940 --> 02:39.360]  Alphabetically, it'd be Gavin and Geoff, Grace.
[02:39.480 --> 02:40.240]  Oh, that's...
[02:40.240 --> 02:40.560]  You know what?
[02:40.620 --> 02:41.380]  Why don't you just flip a coin?
[02:41.460 --> 02:43.100]  Year of birth, it would be Geoff, Gavin.
[02:43.300 --> 02:44.600]  Here's why I'm going to go first.
[02:44.820 --> 02:48.200]  Because he's three quarters of the way towards backing out.
[02:49.160 --> 02:49.520]  Really?
[02:49.520 --> 02:50.840]  The best thing we have to go with...
[02:50.840 --> 02:51.220]  That's a good idea.
[02:51.820 --> 02:52.300]  I know.
[02:53.280 --> 02:56.540]  The best thing we have going for us right now is that he doesn't have a driver's license
[02:56.540 --> 02:58.100]  or a way to get himself home quickly.
[02:59.420 --> 03:00.940]  I've seen him order the Uber.
[03:02.560 --> 03:04.060]  You see me running down the street.
[03:04.640 --> 03:06.460]  Okay, so this is what it's going to look...
[03:06.460 --> 03:07.520]  Okay, then you got your knees up.
[03:07.700 --> 03:09.500]  Okay, so here's the thing.
[03:09.620 --> 03:10.360]  So just like this?
[03:11.340 --> 03:15.520]  I have this and I'd love for them to get their head through this, but it is a little long.
[03:15.680 --> 03:16.320]  I don't want to...
[03:16.320 --> 03:17.800]  I don't want to hinder you.
[03:18.100 --> 03:18.820]  Well, maybe...
[03:19.300 --> 03:20.980]  There's a little pre-created line right there.
[03:21.140 --> 03:21.760]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:21.760 --> 03:22.920]  You can just cut that thing.
[03:23.000 --> 03:23.640]  Oh, look at that.
[03:23.760 --> 03:25.180]  So I'll hold me like this.
[03:28.480 --> 03:31.940]  There is not a look of fear in your eyes at all, Geoff.
[03:31.960 --> 03:33.020]  You look so calm.
[03:33.460 --> 03:34.640]  I feel a little scared.
[03:34.960 --> 03:35.940]  Surprised to hear you say that.
[03:36.440 --> 03:38.040]  I feel just a tiny bit nervous.
[03:38.600 --> 03:38.960]  You look...
[03:38.960 --> 03:39.460]  It didn't show.
[03:39.600 --> 03:41.960]  If it helps, you look really cool.
[03:42.200 --> 03:48.680]  So when you're pantsless, you'll just have it like that so that they're not totally seeing
[03:49.280 --> 03:50.020]  my property.
[03:51.940 --> 03:53.160]  Geoff, look at the frame.
[03:54.780 --> 03:57.900]  Yeah, slow-mo for the first rip.
[03:58.540 --> 03:59.700]  How many rips are there?
[03:59.960 --> 04:00.440]  Four.
[04:01.100 --> 04:01.600]  Oh, my God.
[04:02.340 --> 04:03.540]  And now they're doing everything.
[04:03.720 --> 04:06.460]  I think they need to do at least a little bit of juggling.
[04:08.720 --> 04:10.620]  We didn't agree upon that.
[04:10.760 --> 04:12.720]  Yeah, but that's the butthole area.
[04:13.380 --> 04:15.900]  Emily wants to see you sweepy clean.
[04:16.640 --> 04:17.040]  Louder.
[04:17.260 --> 04:18.380]  Think of the shower farts.
[04:18.560 --> 04:21.340]  How far away are we from me taking my pants off?
[04:21.340 --> 04:22.080]  I'm ready.
[04:23.160 --> 04:24.640]  Okay, hang on, hang on.
[04:25.320 --> 04:26.840]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[04:26.840 --> 04:27.600]  Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[04:28.120 --> 04:29.580]  I need you here again.
[04:31.180 --> 04:33.740]  That's why I kept saying stop out loud a bunch of times.
[04:34.020 --> 04:34.620]  I heard you.
[04:34.760 --> 04:35.160]  Thank you.
[04:41.960 --> 04:43.220]  Guys, this is not real.
[04:43.520 --> 04:44.400]  This is perfect.
[04:44.580 --> 04:48.520]  Okay, now I will say I wasn't super on board with this when we first brought it up.
[04:48.760 --> 04:50.360]  I was wrong.
[04:52.500 --> 04:55.900]  This, you look, Geoff, you look so cool.
[04:56.000 --> 04:56.380]  Hang on.
[04:56.700 --> 04:59.600]  Hannah texted me, texted me a little bit a minute ago and she said,
[04:59.820 --> 05:01.540]  Hey, I think you're getting your asshole waxed today.
[05:01.680 --> 05:03.500]  But I want to see what you punch bassline again.
[05:06.900 --> 05:08.100]  Take my hoodie off too.
[05:08.420 --> 05:09.520]  Yeah, I would think so.
[05:09.680 --> 05:12.400]  Okay, would you like us to step out?
[05:12.960 --> 05:14.840]  Yeah, I would like to step out.
[05:15.740 --> 05:16.560]  I want to step out.
[05:17.180 --> 05:20.060]  Okay, I can never tell my parents what I do for a job.
[05:20.060 --> 05:20.400]  No.
[05:21.340 --> 05:22.120]  I stopped trying.
[05:22.980 --> 05:23.760]  They'll be so concerned.
[05:24.480 --> 05:26.000]  Geoff just went...
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.520]  So, like, everything, no underwear?
[05:29.580 --> 05:30.620]  How would you do it?
[05:30.940 --> 05:31.940]  Where would you put it though?
[05:31.960 --> 05:33.320]  Well, you could maybe peel it up.
[05:33.920 --> 05:34.520]  Peel it.
[05:37.300 --> 05:39.680]  Why did you say this?
[05:39.880 --> 05:40.800]  Why did you do this?
[05:40.820 --> 05:41.800]  Why did you say that thing?
[05:41.840 --> 05:43.760]  And Andrew really locked you all in when he did it.
[05:43.800 --> 05:44.100]  Oh, yeah.
[05:44.940 --> 05:46.980]  His sounded like Velcro.
[05:47.120 --> 05:47.880]  It was so loud.
[05:47.880 --> 05:52.060]  I need a good, like, two to three month period on the podcast where I just don't say anything.
[05:52.280 --> 05:53.200]  I think nothing.
[05:53.680 --> 05:54.600]  Yeah, he's covered.
[05:54.780 --> 05:55.660]  I'm holding my jewels.
[05:55.800 --> 05:56.340]  He's covered.
[05:56.480 --> 05:56.960]  Oh, boy.
[05:57.320 --> 05:58.180]  I'm gonna go get Elise.
[05:58.440 --> 06:01.600]  You guys, go ahead and situate him with the...
[06:02.100 --> 06:02.520]  I'm excited.
[06:02.640 --> 06:03.500]  Geoff is going to welcome me.
[06:03.660 --> 06:04.500]  I'm just letting you know.
[06:05.900 --> 06:06.480]  What's best?
[06:06.640 --> 06:06.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[06:07.120 --> 06:08.380]  Geoff's not going to have a big rip.
[06:08.920 --> 06:09.580]  He's got a lot of hair.
[06:10.640 --> 06:11.280]  That's fun.
[06:11.460 --> 06:12.380]  You don't have a lot of hair.
[06:12.460 --> 06:13.540]  I don't have... oh my god.
[06:14.160 --> 06:15.020]  Gracie, Gracie, can you...
[06:15.020 --> 06:15.140]  I'm sorry.
[06:15.260 --> 06:15.700]  Gracie, can you...
[06:15.700 --> 06:16.740]  I wasn't expecting you at all.
[06:17.000 --> 06:17.360]  Thank you.
[06:17.440 --> 06:17.860]  Just like that.
[06:18.360 --> 06:18.920]  Oh god.
[06:18.980 --> 06:20.500]  I'm just gonna aim this way and stand here.
[06:20.540 --> 06:21.540]  You know who does have a lot of hair?
[06:21.700 --> 06:21.940]  Gavin.
[06:21.960 --> 06:23.560]  No, I just would choose a little bit of oil.
[06:23.720 --> 06:23.960]  Okay.
[06:24.680 --> 06:26.060]  So this is like hard wax.
[06:26.160 --> 06:28.280]  It's a lot more comfortable than your soft wax.
[06:28.440 --> 06:29.820]  Oh, that's good to know.
[06:29.940 --> 06:30.100]  You okay?
[06:30.780 --> 06:32.140]  It is gonna be warm.
[06:32.520 --> 06:33.040]  Dude, it's...
[06:34.900 --> 06:35.260]  Nope.
[06:35.780 --> 06:37.420]  His little ankles push together.
[06:38.580 --> 06:40.140]  So I was in the army for five years,
[06:40.220 --> 06:41.420]  and I would have to get prostate checks,
[06:41.520 --> 06:42.840]  and it was less intimate than this.
[06:44.160 --> 06:45.080]  What's going through?
[06:45.120 --> 06:45.340]  Two.
[06:45.340 --> 06:48.580]  Could you possibly not look straight into my eyes?
[06:50.560 --> 06:52.670]  I'm just making eye contact with you.
[06:55.620 --> 06:56.520]  Oh my god.
[06:56.540 --> 06:57.540]  It's so much wax.
[07:00.320 --> 07:01.360]  Don't scoot away.
[07:01.440 --> 07:02.680]  We need you to hold this right here.
[07:04.860 --> 07:06.020]  He's gonna hide.
[07:06.360 --> 07:08.020]  He's turning so red.
[07:09.480 --> 07:11.060]  There's so much going on.
[07:13.260 --> 07:14.420]  The shake.
[07:15.640 --> 07:17.080]  Wait, are we done already?
[07:19.480 --> 07:20.860]  Was that already happening?
[07:25.400 --> 07:27.340]  I hope you have so much more to handle.
[07:28.720 --> 07:29.380]  All right.
[07:29.700 --> 07:31.720]  Let us know when you're gonna pull,
[07:31.920 --> 07:33.080]  and we're gonna hit record.
[07:33.140 --> 07:34.200]  Oh, it's my hip.
[07:34.260 --> 07:35.060]  That's inside me.
[07:35.340 --> 07:35.660]  Okay.
[07:36.020 --> 07:36.560]  Okay, I got my grip.
[07:36.920 --> 07:37.180]  Ready?
[07:37.340 --> 07:37.760]  You got me rolling?
[07:38.220 --> 07:39.140]  One, two, three.
[07:39.140 --> 07:39.700]  Oh.
[07:55.350 --> 07:55.710]  Okay.
[08:11.380 --> 08:11.740]  Yeah.
[08:17.400 --> 08:18.140]  Yeah, fuck it.
[08:18.180 --> 08:18.640]  Why not, right?
[08:18.980 --> 08:19.420]  You're here.
[08:19.680 --> 08:20.240]  Go for it.
[08:20.360 --> 08:21.600]  How am I ever gonna be in this position?
[08:23.680 --> 08:24.700]  He's doing the scrotum.
[08:26.080 --> 08:27.100]  Okay, what does that mean?
[08:27.220 --> 08:27.560]  Like this?
[08:29.200 --> 08:30.240]  Oh, I would like this.
[08:32.120 --> 08:33.140]  Stop looking at me.
[08:33.660 --> 08:34.280]  Don't look away.
[08:34.360 --> 08:34.740]  Look away.
[08:34.860 --> 08:35.300]  Look away.
[08:35.940 --> 08:36.180]  All right.
[08:36.180 --> 08:37.460]  Let's make sure to get a countdown again,
[08:37.540 --> 08:38.520]  so I can frame up the video.
[08:39.980 --> 08:40.300]  Yeah.
[08:40.520 --> 08:41.940]  Oh, you're gonna like it, Geoff.
[08:42.040 --> 08:43.720]  Geoff, you're gonna like this.
[08:46.980 --> 08:48.380]  Be careful with that curtain there.
[08:48.500 --> 08:51.300]  Your eyes are so steel.
[08:51.880 --> 08:52.580]  All right, here we go.
[08:52.640 --> 08:52.980]  Here we go.
[08:53.080 --> 08:53.180]  Hold on.
[08:57.680 --> 08:59.020]  Oh, it's so much worse.
[09:01.860 --> 09:03.000]  I think I lost hope.
[09:03.560 --> 09:04.300]  I think it came out.
[09:04.800 --> 09:06.000]  Oh, my God.
[09:12.540 --> 09:13.900]  Is there another one coming?
[09:14.160 --> 09:14.360]  Yeah.
[09:14.500 --> 09:16.940]  Yeah, there's another like two, three, four, five.
[09:17.220 --> 09:17.480]  Oh, this is nice.
[09:17.980 --> 09:19.140]  Oh, brace yourself.
[09:19.180 --> 09:19.900]  Three, four, five.
[09:20.100 --> 09:20.600]  This is good.
[09:20.700 --> 09:22.000]  Small breathing into your nose.
[09:22.660 --> 09:23.060]  Out your mouth.
[09:39.630 --> 09:42.940]  Yeah, are you like pumped for this or what?
[09:48.130 --> 09:49.270]  I'm a team player.
[10:08.530 --> 10:09.190]  These turtles.
[10:09.390 --> 10:09.770]  I'm just turning.
[10:09.830 --> 10:10.770]  I'm just turning on the fan.
[10:10.950 --> 10:12.330]  Yeah, there's nothing to see.
[10:12.430 --> 10:14.430]  My dick is about three feet inside me right now.
[10:14.510 --> 10:15.290]  It's around my lungs.
[10:22.830 --> 10:24.690]  I feel so much safer behind the camera.
[10:27.670 --> 10:28.010]  Okay.
[10:43.940 --> 10:46.440]  No, your heels need to touch.
[10:46.540 --> 10:47.040]  That's okay.
[10:47.160 --> 10:48.440]  My heels need it like this.
[10:49.020 --> 10:49.480]  Oh, okay.
[10:49.760 --> 10:53.720]  It looks like you're having a baby.
[11:08.440 --> 11:09.240]  You're next.
[11:10.920 --> 11:12.160]  I'm not going to screw it up.
[11:12.520 --> 11:12.940]  You should.
[11:13.100 --> 11:13.460]  You might.
[11:13.460 --> 11:14.080]  You might.
[11:30.910 --> 11:31.270]  Okay.
[11:35.390 --> 11:36.130]  Way to go, Geoff.
[11:36.250 --> 11:37.130]  Here, let's take this off.
[11:37.130 --> 11:37.550]  You did it.
[11:38.130 --> 11:38.950]  You did it.
[11:40.510 --> 11:41.570]  So I'm all done?
[11:42.570 --> 11:43.590]  We're going to step out.
[11:43.730 --> 11:44.210]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[11:44.210 --> 11:45.730]  We're going to take a walk out.
[11:49.010 --> 11:49.650]  Confer with...
[11:49.650 --> 11:51.770]  So how do you feel now?
[11:52.430 --> 11:52.790]  Not good.
[11:53.290 --> 11:54.530]  I feel way worse than before.
[11:58.130 --> 11:58.810]  How are you doing, man?
[11:59.990 --> 12:00.550]  How are you doing?
[12:03.450 --> 12:03.770]  Okay.
[12:06.510 --> 12:08.090]  So you want to show me how to shoot with this thing?
[12:08.910 --> 12:10.830]  We don't have to use this one if you want to keep it fun.
[12:11.190 --> 12:11.830]  Yeah, I can.
[12:12.170 --> 12:12.510]  All right.
[12:12.510 --> 12:15.030]  We're going to step out and Gavin's going to go ahead and...
[12:15.030 --> 12:15.630]  You got this, man.
[12:16.210 --> 12:18.550]  Do you need help or anything or what?
[12:18.690 --> 12:19.650]  Yeah, do any of these open?
[12:20.270 --> 12:22.370]  No, they're all sealed shut.
[12:23.190 --> 12:24.670]  All right, let's step out.
[12:24.670 --> 12:26.170]  You can Arnie it through the mirror or something.
[12:26.950 --> 12:31.330]  It's the closest that I've seen from you where you don't...
[12:33.290 --> 12:35.670]  You wish you didn't do the content.
[12:37.170 --> 12:38.130]  You are...
[12:38.130 --> 12:41.170]  Your eyes, it's like that thousand yard stare.
[12:41.450 --> 12:44.290]  It's the World War I soldier who's like,
[12:44.290 --> 12:45.530]  Oh, he's so shocked.
[12:46.370 --> 12:48.070]  Gavin is in there trying to figure out how to escape.
[12:48.250 --> 12:50.970]  It just feels sore and raw.
[12:51.050 --> 12:51.970]  It feels raw.
[12:52.290 --> 12:52.890]  Raw is good.
[12:52.910 --> 12:55.590]  But more than anything, it's just like, I feel like I'm a little like...
[12:55.590 --> 12:58.710]  I'm still dealing with the experience, you know?
[12:58.930 --> 12:59.850]  You, uh, how's your...
[13:04.070 --> 13:04.710]  You're good?
[13:05.410 --> 13:06.050]  Oh, thank you.
[13:07.290 --> 13:08.890]  Yeah, well, we're not going to...
[13:08.890 --> 13:09.930]  That's not really going to matter.
[13:10.130 --> 13:10.870]  It's just...
[13:10.870 --> 13:11.250]  There we go.
[13:11.370 --> 13:13.110]  All right, so you're going to have to hold the one side again.
[13:13.110 --> 13:16.610]  I mean, Geoff, do you want to see it off to the side here?
[13:16.850 --> 13:18.450]  We just need to let Elise get through on this side.
[13:18.450 --> 13:18.910]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:18.910 --> 13:19.430]  And then we're good.
[13:19.470 --> 13:20.190]  Yes, talent.
[13:20.790 --> 13:22.450]  Yep, talent, talent coming through.
[13:23.350 --> 13:24.950]  Your hair flipping up over the window.
[13:25.230 --> 13:25.870]  Oh, it looks good.
[13:26.190 --> 13:27.390]  It's going to be fine.
[13:30.470 --> 13:31.550]  You're going to be fine.
[13:34.590 --> 13:35.290]  What does that mean?
[13:35.430 --> 13:36.270]  Roll him up to your chest.
[13:37.050 --> 13:38.070]  All right, yeah, like I did.
[13:38.990 --> 13:39.690]  You're going to have it, right?
[13:39.970 --> 13:40.330]  I know.
[13:41.970 --> 13:42.290]  Okay.
[13:42.290 --> 13:43.770]  Just make eye contact with me, Gracie.
[13:44.490 --> 13:46.170]  You're getting pretty close to being a dub.
[13:46.470 --> 13:46.630]  Yeah.
[13:46.810 --> 13:47.070]  All right.
[13:47.130 --> 13:48.570]  I'm going to do some witch hazel first.
[13:48.650 --> 13:49.350]  What does that mean?
[13:49.550 --> 13:50.690]  It's very...
[13:50.690 --> 13:51.090]  It's nice.
[13:51.170 --> 13:51.730]  She's just getting the pimple.
[13:51.730 --> 13:52.330]  It's relaxing.
[13:53.110 --> 13:55.170]  Oh, it's been about 33 years since I've felt this.
[13:55.230 --> 13:56.010]  I'm going to put some oil.
[13:57.530 --> 13:58.830]  That's not the bad part.
[13:58.930 --> 13:59.290]  Deep.
[14:01.990 --> 14:04.750]  I feel like in some ways, Elise knows me better than Emily does.
[14:04.770 --> 14:05.210]  Yeah, really?
[14:05.750 --> 14:06.610]  Oh, that's warm.
[14:06.890 --> 14:07.870]  Oh, dear.
[14:08.190 --> 14:10.950]  How would you describe the amount of hair on his anus compared to mine?
[14:12.490 --> 14:12.890]  Tremendous.
[14:14.930 --> 14:19.550]  Uh, I have the immense disadvantage of being Italian.
[14:19.850 --> 14:20.030]  Yeah.
[14:20.350 --> 14:21.050]  Good lord.
[14:21.130 --> 14:23.130]  This is a lot of...
[14:23.130 --> 14:23.850]  Oh, the strip's on?
[14:24.170 --> 14:24.850]  Yeah, the strip's on.
[14:24.910 --> 14:25.230]  Okay.
[14:25.490 --> 14:26.690]  I'm rolling whenever you're ready.
[14:27.090 --> 14:27.950]  Which way is it going to run?
[14:28.190 --> 14:28.290]  Okay.
[14:28.550 --> 14:28.570]  Down.
[14:29.250 --> 14:29.550]  Two.
[14:29.950 --> 14:30.410]  Which way is down?
[14:30.550 --> 14:30.810]  Three.
[14:31.570 --> 14:32.750]  Oh, it's gone.
[14:33.550 --> 14:34.170]  Emily, one more.
[14:34.370 --> 14:34.570]  Yeah.
[14:39.950 --> 14:40.870]  Keep those knees up.
[14:41.070 --> 14:42.910]  His face is so red.
[14:45.490 --> 14:46.850]  Oh, my god.
[14:47.010 --> 14:48.070]  Don't film the hair.
[14:48.730 --> 14:49.990]  Don't film it.
[14:50.910 --> 14:52.150]  I didn't film it.
[14:53.610 --> 14:56.530]  I just put myself in my own worst nightmare.
[14:58.710 --> 15:02.490]  Looking up at people laughing and wincing at my pubic hair.
[15:03.130 --> 15:03.670]  Are you recording?
[15:04.750 --> 15:05.290]  Yep.
[15:06.110 --> 15:06.670]  Okay.
[15:07.510 --> 15:07.770]  Yeah.
[15:10.590 --> 15:12.130]  That just felt like the edge.
[15:12.730 --> 15:13.950]  Oh, I'm spread.
[15:15.290 --> 15:17.790]  Make sure you keep those feet up, Gavin.
[15:17.890 --> 15:18.770]  Don't make eye contact with me.
[15:19.990 --> 15:20.290]  Stop.
[15:21.570 --> 15:24.410]  That is completely over everything.
[15:24.590 --> 15:25.310]  It's so hot.
[15:25.890 --> 15:26.670]  It's not that hot.
[15:28.450 --> 15:29.510]  It's not going to hurt you.
[15:29.970 --> 15:30.910]  What do you mean?
[15:31.870 --> 15:32.830]  It's not cold.
[15:33.310 --> 15:33.770]  All right.
[15:34.070 --> 15:34.390]  Feet up?
[15:34.810 --> 15:35.050]  Yep.
[15:35.590 --> 15:36.510]  Don't pull down.
[15:36.850 --> 15:38.030]  Yeah, hold steady.
[15:38.070 --> 15:39.530]  Because I have like two to go.
[15:39.810 --> 15:41.710]  So I'll pull down if I break hair, that's okay.
[15:41.830 --> 15:42.810]  Yeah, you don't want to do that.
[15:42.990 --> 15:43.590]  Legs up.
[15:45.530 --> 15:46.330]  Black sheep.
[15:46.470 --> 15:48.030]  Breathe in and out.
[15:49.070 --> 15:50.650]  One more and out.
[15:54.490 --> 15:55.970]  Oh my god.
[15:57.090 --> 15:58.390]  I won't film it on this.
[15:58.450 --> 15:59.710]  I won't film it on this, Gavin.
[15:59.810 --> 16:00.490]  I won't do it.
[16:00.810 --> 16:01.430]  I won't do it.
[16:01.610 --> 16:03.630]  Okay, now that you're very cleaned up.
[16:03.850 --> 16:04.450]  I'm all good.
[16:04.630 --> 16:05.570]  I think I'm getting lighter.
[16:08.410 --> 16:11.030]  Gavin, make sure you keep those feet up, man.
[16:11.750 --> 16:15.150]  That one strip was more than all my hair put together with my balls in it.
[16:16.910 --> 16:19.310]  Oh, I'm gonna have some, uh...
[16:20.810 --> 16:23.130]  I can feel it in the blood holes.
[16:26.870 --> 16:29.790]  I feel like Geoff's was funny and mine is just a bit shocking.
[16:29.950 --> 16:30.450]  It's funny to me.
[16:31.190 --> 16:32.150]  It is shocking.
[16:32.830 --> 16:33.830]  Keep those feet up, Gavin.
[16:33.850 --> 16:35.710]  I'm gonna be honest with you, mine was pretty shocking to me.
[16:35.870 --> 16:36.030]  Yeah.
[16:36.130 --> 16:37.510]  It didn't feel super funny at the time.
[16:38.350 --> 16:38.930]  And now?
[16:39.410 --> 16:39.810]  Feel free to...
[16:39.810 --> 16:40.170]  Hilarious.
[16:40.390 --> 16:41.850]  The way you're standing over it is insane.
[16:42.210 --> 16:47.070]  Oh, a f*** face production.
[16:50.230 --> 16:53.710]  Ow, oh god, it's like...
[16:54.990 --> 16:57.390]  It's like a woodpecker just going apeshit.
[17:17.220 --> 17:19.340]  You're glitching lava on the cornhole.
[17:22.040 --> 17:24.160]  This is a functioning business, I should shut up.
[17:26.760 --> 17:27.940]  Yeah, real clean.
[17:28.140 --> 17:29.020]  I think we should call this lava.
[17:30.640 --> 17:31.760]  You did it!
[17:31.780 --> 17:32.980]  You did it, you're done!
[17:33.160 --> 17:34.080]  You did it!
[17:36.640 --> 17:37.360]  Congrats, buddy.
[17:38.220 --> 17:39.540]  You did it, let's get this off of you.
[17:39.700 --> 17:41.380]  Let's get this little stuff out.
[17:41.560 --> 17:43.300]  Yeah, all right, you did great, Gavin.
[17:44.320 --> 17:45.200]  Oh my god.
[17:45.920 --> 17:47.140]  Yes, thank you.
[17:47.680 --> 17:48.340]  Yo, bud.
[17:49.180 --> 17:49.660]  Are you limping?
[17:52.040 --> 17:53.280]  I need to lie down.
[18:00.240 --> 18:01.740]  Okay, thank you very much.
[18:06.080 --> 18:09.660]  So now that goes in the front of every video we produce.
[18:09.840 --> 18:12.380]  I think we have a lot of variants.
[18:12.460 --> 18:13.000]  Yeah, we have variants.
[18:13.000 --> 18:16.280]  When you say f*** face production, that is a stroke of genius.
[18:16.480 --> 18:17.140]  That was so great.
[18:17.140 --> 18:17.640]  Yeah, that's so great.
[18:18.200 --> 18:23.000]  The most disturbing thing was just looking at Gracie after she saw the hair.
[18:23.060 --> 18:25.620]  It was like she was watching a car crash.
[18:26.380 --> 18:27.280]  The fact of it was.
[18:29.860 --> 18:32.700]  I wasn't expecting this trip to come into my line of sight.
[18:33.360 --> 18:36.740]  Elise, if people want to get waxed similarly and they want to come to you,
[18:36.800 --> 18:37.740]  where can they find you?
[18:37.800 --> 18:39.160]  Friends Forever ATX.
[18:39.560 --> 18:40.780]  Friends Forever ATX.
[18:40.800 --> 18:41.640]  You made a friend forever.
[18:41.640 --> 18:42.580]  You can get waxed.
[18:42.580 --> 18:43.800]  I'll be sending my Christmas gift.
[18:48.000 --> 18:48.340]  Hey.
[18:53.060 --> 18:54.120]  That's all folks.
