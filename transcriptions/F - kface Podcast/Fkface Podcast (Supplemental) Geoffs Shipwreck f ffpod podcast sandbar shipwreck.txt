[00:00.000 --> 00:05.860]  I swam out to, uh, the shittiest, smallest, uh, fucking shipwreck of all time.
[00:05.860 --> 00:07.680]  Can I post a picture of it? Yeah, please!
[00:08.100 --> 00:12.640]  This was the deepest the water got, and this was the entire shipwreck.
[00:12.840 --> 00:16.520]  Oh my god. That is it. That is very accurate.
[00:17.020 --> 00:20.280]  It's below Geoff's waist is how high the water goes.
[00:20.960 --> 00:24.620]  Is that the shipwreck behind him? Yeah, it's covered in birds.
[00:24.880 --> 00:28.780]  It looks like a rowboat wreck from, like, it's so small.
[00:28.780 --> 00:29.740]  It's terrible.
