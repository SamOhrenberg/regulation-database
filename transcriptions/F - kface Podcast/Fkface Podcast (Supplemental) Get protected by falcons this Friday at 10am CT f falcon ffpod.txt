[00:00.000 --> 00:05.260]  Are you like me? A totally cool, awesome, rad dude who's a little bit older and doesn't
[00:05.260 --> 00:11.720]  want to bend down to pick stuff up anymore? Well, then you need a 100% completely filmable
[00:11.720 --> 00:17.480]  shoulder falcon companion pal. Just take the hood off so he can see. Smell. Get a sense?
[00:17.700 --> 00:18.780]  Okay, go. Now I throw it.
[00:21.680 --> 00:22.120]  Fly!
[00:24.320 --> 00:25.040]  Oh, it hooked.
[00:30.150 --> 00:31.150]  That looks pretty good.
[00:32.370 --> 00:33.970]  Yeah, he's in a red suit, dude.
[00:34.030 --> 00:35.050]  Yeah, yeah, we can red screen.
[00:35.130 --> 00:38.330]  There's no such thing as red screen. You can green screen, you can blue screen.
[00:38.450 --> 00:40.810]  Yeah, it's red. But he's all red. You just take out all the red.
[00:40.930 --> 00:41.150]  That's true, right.
[00:41.370 --> 00:43.550]  You just take him out, and then it's like the falcon is...
[00:43.550 --> 00:46.170]  Nobody's gonna be able to see the fire zone anymore.
[00:46.530 --> 00:48.910]  Well, that's fine. We'll just, we'll red screen out the fire zone. It's fine.
[00:49.310 --> 00:52.950]  See, and then it looks like, see, because you can look and it looks like he's coming back to see the ball.
[00:53.190 --> 00:53.870]  That's fucking amazing.
[00:57.530 --> 00:58.210]  Thanks, buddy!
