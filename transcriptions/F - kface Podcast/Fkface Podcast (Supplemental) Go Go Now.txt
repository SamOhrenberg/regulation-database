[00:00.000 --> 00:05.660]  We're probably gonna die. I haven't seen land in three hours. I've been beaten to hell,
[00:05.980 --> 00:12.380]  banged around, uh, for hours and hours. I've got no food in me. The only food available is
[00:12.380 --> 00:17.920]  slathered in mayonnaise and chum. And I gotta, I gotta, I gotta half a sprite to my name. And we're
[00:17.920 --> 00:23.420]  like, what is going on? How long till we get back? And the guy goes, 30 minutes. And I'm like,
[00:23.540 --> 00:28.760]  there's no fucking way we're gonna be back in 30 minutes. We're not. We're hours away from land.
[00:28.760 --> 00:33.720]  And then sure enough, about 30 minutes later, this other boat full of, it's another whale
[00:33.720 --> 00:39.180]  watching whale shark watching tour, full, full boat, right? It gets a little close to us. And
[00:39.180 --> 00:43.280]  the guy turns to us and he goes, uh, they're going to take you back. And we're like, oh,
[00:43.420 --> 00:49.080]  so we're going to get on that boat. And he goes, yeah. And I go, how? And he goes, go, go now,
[00:49.260 --> 00:53.880]  go now! And we go, what? What? And he goes, go now! Get in the ocean! Go now! And we're like,
[00:53.900 --> 00:57.980]  what? Our stuff! And he goes, don't worry about it! Go now! I've got your stuff! And we're like,
[00:57.980 --> 01:04.440]  and we all dive into the ocean and then we have to swim through these giant waves and crazy with
[01:04.440 --> 01:10.360]  no flippers on or anything. Just like, I got my hat on, my clothes. I'm like, I just fucking swim.
[01:10.620 --> 01:14.820]  I get there, pull ourselves up, get on the boat, right? No idea what just happened. Look back.
[01:15.000 --> 01:19.060]  And I'm like, all our stuff's on that boat. And then I see, I see all of our shit just flying
[01:19.060 --> 01:23.720]  through the air from one boat to another. They're just chucking it at us. Right. And I realized,
[01:23.720 --> 01:30.600]  oh my God, my phone and my wallet are in my shoes. Threw my shoes 30 feet in the air over
[01:30.600 --> 01:35.360]  open ocean with my phone and my fucking wallet in it. I fucking run up. They're there. We didn't
[01:35.360 --> 01:39.560]  lose anything. But I was like, I was like, oh, I couldn't believe it, dude. It was the most
[01:39.560 --> 01:44.560]  horrific thing I've ever seen. It's like just all of our shit, like exploding on the ground on the
[01:44.560 --> 01:53.700]  boat. Then those guys, the boat we're on where they like, they like, sit down. We sit down for a
[01:53.700 --> 02:01.220]  while. We just left them bobbing in the ocean. And then we just rocket back, just drenched from head
[02:01.220 --> 02:05.460]  to toe. We start to pull back up to Isla Mujeres. And then so we get there and we dot, like they
[02:05.460 --> 02:08.920]  throw down the anchor and they're like, okay, they communicate. We're going to be here for about 15
[02:08.920 --> 02:13.760]  minutes. Go swimming, relax. Then we'll cook up some fresh ceviche for you. And then we'll take
[02:13.760 --> 02:18.260]  you guys back to Cancun. Did you say Cancun? And they're like, yeah, yeah, this charter goes to
[02:18.260 --> 02:22.560]  Cancun. And I'm like, no, no, no, no. We're here on this island. Take us to a dock on this island.
[02:22.560 --> 02:27.620]  And he's like, we don't go to a dock on this island. We dock in Cancun. So I'm like, fuck this
[02:27.620 --> 02:32.320]  and fuck you. I look at the guys and I'm like, we're swimming in. I jump, I jump in the water
[02:32.320 --> 02:38.960]  with all the stuff on my head. And we very, very slowly walk onto the beach holding everything
[02:38.960 --> 02:44.100]  amidst all of these like sunbathers and people playing beach volleyball. And I don't know if
[02:44.100 --> 02:51.020]  it's, if it's been apparent at any point, but at no point in this six, it was over six hours,
[02:51.020 --> 02:58.380]  seven hours. Did I see a whale shark? Whoa, you want to see where that clip's from and
