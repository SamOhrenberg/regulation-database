[00:01.140 --> 00:03.900]  Gavin shows up at my house, and as we're driving, he goes,
[00:04.080 --> 00:07.080]  I had a weird thing happen today. And I go, what's that?
[00:07.140 --> 00:10.620]  And he goes, somebody chucked a load of pickles on my front door
[00:10.620 --> 00:14.160]  in a bag full of brine, like pickle brine.
[00:14.400 --> 00:17.340]  And I was like, you mean like a jar of LASIK pickles, full pickles,
[00:17.900 --> 00:21.140]  dumped into a freezer bag, ziplocked shut, like full of brine and pickles.
[00:21.340 --> 00:23.240]  And he was like, yeah, it's just on my front porch.
[00:23.580 --> 00:27.560]  And then I was like, well, you have cameras, so let's look at the cameras.
[00:27.560 --> 00:31.640]  He pulls up, there's no... the pickles just show up on his front door camera.
[00:33.160 --> 00:36.820]  It's like they just get delivered by a hand that didn't have a body.
[00:37.360 --> 00:41.140]  You can just see them like slide into frame, and there's no one there.
[00:41.240 --> 00:43.680]  So the whole ride back to Gavin's house, we're going to give him a ride home.
[00:43.840 --> 00:46.040]  We're like, do you think the pickles will be on the porch? Should we check?
[00:46.320 --> 00:51.820]  We get there, we run up, and there were three giant dry-ass cucumbers
[00:51.820 --> 00:54.540]  in a ziplock bag. There were pickles.
[00:55.040 --> 00:56.660]  I don't know how Gavin got that they were pickles.
[00:56.660 --> 00:59.980]  There was no pickled brine. There was no brine of anything.
[01:00.180 --> 01:02.760]  It was just three cucumbers in a bag.
[01:03.240 --> 01:07.220]  In my defense, the bag was full of condensation, and I think I mistook it for...
[01:07.220 --> 01:11.020]  All I did really, there was an Uber waiting.
[01:11.160 --> 01:13.040]  I just walked out my front door.
[01:13.300 --> 01:16.640]  I thought, that looks like a bag of pickles as I stepped over them.
[01:16.740 --> 01:18.680]  And then I just continued walking. I didn't touch him.
[01:18.720 --> 01:19.580]  I didn't really look at him.
[01:19.680 --> 01:23.640]  I walk up, I look at the cucumbers, look to the right, see the note, pick it up.
[01:23.840 --> 01:26.100]  It's like, hey, here's some cucumbers from the garden.
[01:26.100 --> 01:28.960]  If you don't need them, pass them on to the next neighbor, thanks.
[01:29.420 --> 01:31.920]  It was more confusing at a glance.
[01:32.280 --> 01:34.420]  Everything made sense now that I had time to investigate.
[01:34.900 --> 01:37.440]  He found footage from another camera that was fascinating.
[01:37.760 --> 01:40.020]  It was delivered, I guess, by an elderly woman.
[01:40.700 --> 01:42.660]  Who Mission Impossible'd it.
[01:42.680 --> 01:47.160]  Kind of looked like a witch out of Left 4 Dead.
[01:47.160 --> 01:51.400]  And she was hobbling around.
[01:51.960 --> 01:55.600]  And she grabs the pole near the front of the house.
[01:55.920 --> 02:01.640]  And kind of swings her arm around and slides it onto the bit that the camera could see.
[02:01.920 --> 02:03.680]  She deliberately avoided going up the steps.
[02:03.760 --> 02:06.760]  She just reached around the railings and put it there.
[02:06.800 --> 02:09.780]  So it looked like, from the doorbell, that no one delivered it.
[02:10.060 --> 02:11.560]  Gavin was right when he texted it to me.
[02:11.600 --> 02:13.180]  He goes, she has advanced angles.
[02:13.640 --> 02:15.220]  And he couldn't have been more true.
[02:16.840 --> 02:20.580]  She totally... Ethan hunted her way across his driveway.
[02:21.060 --> 02:22.560]  She hugged the wall.
[02:22.960 --> 02:25.280]  She was looking over her shoulder and looking around.
[02:25.560 --> 02:27.940]  Trying to spot, I don't know, threats.
[02:28.340 --> 02:29.540]  It was fucking fascinating.
[02:29.780 --> 02:32.220]  And then she just disappeared into the darkness from which she came.
[02:32.460 --> 02:34.600]  And she did look a little like a Left 4 Dead witch.
[02:34.820 --> 02:35.580]  He's not wrong there.
[02:35.800 --> 02:37.880]  And she didn't come from the street.
[02:37.980 --> 02:39.880]  It looked like she came out of my own garage somehow.
[02:40.020 --> 02:41.160]  I don't know where she came from.
[02:41.160 --> 02:43.360]  She came from your backyard or wherever.
[02:43.360 --> 02:45.340]  I assume she lives under the house.
[02:45.480 --> 02:46.000]  I don't know.
[02:46.220 --> 02:49.140]  Maybe they're my cucumbers and she just picked them for me.
[02:52.800 --> 02:53.240]  Whoa.
[02:53.440 --> 02:55.160]  You want to see where that clip's from?
