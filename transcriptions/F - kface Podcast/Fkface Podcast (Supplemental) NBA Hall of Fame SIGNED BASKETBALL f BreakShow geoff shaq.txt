[00:00.000 --> 00:06.260]  All right, here we go. We have autographed basketball from...
[00:06.260 --> 00:06.980]  It's orange.
[00:07.140 --> 00:09.620]  I mean, where are you going to be able... you're not going to be able to know who it is.
[00:10.600 --> 00:13.960]  It's Adam Silver. Okay, we have...
[00:13.960 --> 00:16.940]  It's got to be in the box, like a certificate or something.
[00:18.540 --> 00:19.840]  Oh my God, I know what it is.
[00:19.840 --> 00:20.040]  What?
[00:20.180 --> 00:21.980]  Because there's a name in here. What do you think it is?
[00:22.540 --> 00:23.340]  I can't read it.
[00:23.420 --> 00:24.020]  I don't know.
[00:24.660 --> 00:24.980]  Wimby?
[00:25.720 --> 00:26.000]  Chewy.
[00:26.360 --> 00:26.620]  Chewy.
[00:27.120 --> 00:27.620]  Shaquille O'Neal.
[00:27.620 --> 00:29.840]  Are you serious? No way!
[00:30.200 --> 00:30.660]  Are you serious?
[00:30.660 --> 00:31.440]  It says Shaquille O'Neal!
[00:32.580 --> 00:33.280]  We got Shaq!
[00:34.800 --> 00:35.240]  What?!
[00:35.240 --> 00:36.300]  Where's our Shaq? Shaq!
[00:36.620 --> 00:38.040]  I got to dunk the basketball!
[00:38.680 --> 00:39.640]  Hit him, hit him, do it!
[00:40.300 --> 00:41.980]  That's how I beat Shaq!
