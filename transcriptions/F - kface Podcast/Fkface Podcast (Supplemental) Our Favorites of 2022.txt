[00:14.890 --> 00:19.750]  Hello and welcome to another piece of supplemental f***face content.
[00:20.250 --> 00:29.430]  This is the best of 2022 as deemed by the members of the f***face podcast.
[00:29.570 --> 00:30.330]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:30.390 --> 00:34.250]  With me as always, Gavin Free, Andrew Panton, way out there in Canada.
[00:34.610 --> 00:36.270]  And then Eric and Nick are here as well.
[00:36.270 --> 00:43.690]  This is 100% Andrew's idea, however, he tried to disown it three minutes ago.
[00:44.050 --> 00:48.890]  The whole time you weren't in here, Gavin, it was Andrew distancing himself from the
[00:48.890 --> 00:50.190]  thing we were about to do.
[00:50.850 --> 00:53.530]  That he presented to the audience, or to the group.
[00:53.810 --> 00:55.910]  First of all, I suggested it as an idea.
[00:56.030 --> 00:57.570]  I was like, hey, we could do this, we don't have to do this.
[00:57.890 --> 00:59.010]  Geoff was very against it.
[00:59.290 --> 01:01.510]  We talked about it in the episode we just recorded.
[01:02.130 --> 01:05.110]  And then today when we started, I was like, you know, we don't have to, it doesn't really
[01:05.110 --> 01:05.630]  matter to me.
[01:05.630 --> 01:06.650]  It's not a big deal.
[01:06.710 --> 01:08.330]  And Geoff's like, no, I did prep, we're doing this.
[01:08.470 --> 01:11.270]  In the episode, I said it, I determined it was a good idea.
[01:11.270 --> 01:11.490]  I was positive.
[01:11.490 --> 01:14.350]  In the episode, you said originally you didn't want to do it, and then you thought it was
[01:14.350 --> 01:14.590]  a good idea.
[01:15.190 --> 01:18.190]  I mean, it's been talked about and promoted in an episode.
[01:18.510 --> 01:20.090]  Clearly, we're going to do it.
[01:21.350 --> 01:22.410]  Why the fuck wouldn't we?
[01:22.470 --> 01:25.070]  I mean, Eric still has an icy hot in his balls, and that was promoted five weeks ago.
[01:25.150 --> 01:27.830]  Listen, listen, I am of the opinion...
[01:27.830 --> 01:28.850]  Geoff almost did it by himself.
[01:29.250 --> 01:32.090]  I am of the opinion that we try not to piss Eric off anymore today.
[01:32.130 --> 01:33.870]  I just had questions.
[01:33.870 --> 01:35.470]  No one answered my questions.
[01:35.470 --> 01:38.610]  And now we're rolling for nine minutes.
[01:39.210 --> 01:40.170]  And what was your question?
[01:41.630 --> 01:42.230]  Doesn't matter.
[01:42.510 --> 01:43.110]  Talk about it.
[01:43.150 --> 01:45.810]  You want to cut Geoff reading his recipe book to himself?
[01:46.270 --> 01:48.030]  You asked for a carrot soup recipe.
[01:48.950 --> 01:52.490]  No, I was making a point of I wouldn't know how to make carrot soup.
[01:52.570 --> 01:54.270]  Gavin was saying, who needs that?
[01:54.290 --> 01:54.910]  It's so obvious.
[01:55.070 --> 01:57.170]  I don't think I do know how to make carrot soup.
[01:57.250 --> 01:57.830]  I would need a recipe.
[02:00.090 --> 02:07.470]  2022 was in many ways the shittiest of the post of the pandemic trilogy for me.
[02:07.490 --> 02:08.810]  Yeah, started in 2020.
[02:09.090 --> 02:11.570]  We thought, well, 2021 can't be as bad as 2020.
[02:11.730 --> 02:12.530]  And then it was worse.
[02:12.530 --> 02:15.950]  And then I thought, foolishly, 2022 cannot be worse than 2021.
[02:16.390 --> 02:19.150]  Boy, was it in a myriad of ways.
[02:19.870 --> 02:21.830]  A couple of car accidents.
[02:22.510 --> 02:22.910]  COVID.
[02:25.190 --> 02:27.810]  A million vacations got canceled.
[02:28.210 --> 02:29.410]  Dogs died.
[02:31.790 --> 02:33.530]  Your mouth got sewn apart.
[02:33.770 --> 02:37.390]  I had, you know, my mouth, I had my gum thing.
[02:37.570 --> 02:38.210]  I still don't have a fridge.
[02:38.250 --> 02:39.090]  You still don't have a fridge.
[02:39.150 --> 02:39.850]  I get one in February.
[02:40.030 --> 02:41.370]  I'm two months away or three months away now.
[02:42.130 --> 02:42.410]  I forgot.
[02:42.550 --> 02:43.810]  I had a surprise root canal.
[02:44.090 --> 02:47.450]  Remember the COVID like activated a previous root canal and they had to re-root canal it?
[02:47.530 --> 02:48.710]  I had that whole thing.
[02:49.050 --> 02:51.350]  I had jock itch for 80% of the year.
[02:52.950 --> 02:56.210]  Just like one thing after another was just worse than the last.
[02:57.490 --> 03:01.830]  However, some things were extremely positive and I didn't realize it.
[03:01.850 --> 03:06.630]  And that's why I like that Andrew presented this as a potential content, because it forced
[03:06.630 --> 03:09.570]  me to sit down and try to think of positive things that happened in 2022.
[03:09.970 --> 03:10.870]  Turns out there were a lot.
[03:10.950 --> 03:11.310]  That's great.
[03:11.370 --> 03:12.570]  A lot of good stuff happened in 2022.
[03:12.870 --> 03:14.170]  We all compiled a list.
[03:14.630 --> 03:17.950]  I'll go first because I know Gavin didn't compile a list and we'll give him a little
[03:17.950 --> 03:18.350]  bit of time.
[03:19.150 --> 03:20.330]  I just couldn't think of anything.
[03:20.330 --> 03:23.390]  First off, right off the bat, right off the bat, and I got to lead with this.
[03:23.870 --> 03:24.710]  I got engaged.
[03:25.090 --> 03:25.910]  Emily said yes.
[03:27.150 --> 03:33.710]  Emily, the most wonderful woman, the most wonderful woman in the world said yes to
[03:33.710 --> 03:33.850]  me.
[03:34.050 --> 03:35.150]  And so that was awesome.
[03:35.310 --> 03:36.010]  Highlight of the year right there.
[03:36.210 --> 03:41.310]  Then my daughter, Millicent, young Millie, not so young anymore, 17.
[03:42.350 --> 03:48.850]  She had a surgery, she had a surgery, like basically had her face rebuilt in June.
[03:48.850 --> 03:53.270]  That has been in the works for half of her life.
[03:53.610 --> 03:58.570]  And it's been like this huge monumental moment that we've been working towards with fear
[03:58.570 --> 04:02.990]  and trepidation and excitement and a lot of stress.
[04:03.130 --> 04:03.910]  And we did it.
[04:04.030 --> 04:06.130]  And the recovery was a nightmare and it was brutal.
[04:06.610 --> 04:10.430]  But she she did recover and she's in a much better place physically.
[04:11.370 --> 04:12.970]  And that was a huge success.
[04:13.010 --> 04:14.790]  So that was a big weight off my shoulders.
[04:14.930 --> 04:17.650]  You were telling me about that even back when I lived with you.
[04:17.650 --> 04:20.630]  Yeah, since she's been like seven or eight, we've known about it her whole life.
[04:20.830 --> 04:25.110]  And so it was like this huge gravitational pull that was pulling all of our stress and
[04:25.110 --> 04:26.270]  energy and into this event.
[04:26.350 --> 04:28.410]  And then it finally happened and we got through it and it was awesome.
[04:28.570 --> 04:32.130]  And she, well, it wasn't awesome, but the surgery went really well and she recovered
[04:32.130 --> 04:33.730]  really well and she was a trooper and she's great.
[04:33.930 --> 04:34.930]  And so that's a huge success.
[04:35.130 --> 04:37.870]  How has that felt being over that?
[04:37.990 --> 04:41.830]  Is it like a sigh of relief thing or is it like a constant, like, I feel 10 pounds lighter?
[04:42.050 --> 04:43.350]  I feel 100 pounds lighter.
[04:43.830 --> 04:49.290]  Like it is, the brutality of it is that I went through the surgery.
[04:49.690 --> 04:52.150]  And so I remembered it all.
[04:52.530 --> 04:53.890]  And so I knew what she had ahead of her.
[04:54.150 --> 04:58.490]  Now I knew that she had a less severe version than I did and technology has grown leaps
[04:58.490 --> 04:58.950]  and bounds.
[04:59.290 --> 05:03.090]  So hopefully it was an easier surgery, but still it's just brutal and it's hard to have
[05:03.090 --> 05:03.910]  your face all cut up.
[05:04.090 --> 05:06.410]  It's hard not to be able to open your mouth for six weeks.
[05:06.710 --> 05:09.350]  It's hard not to be able to eat anything solid for six weeks.
[05:09.810 --> 05:12.210]  And then so I was just heartbroken knowing she was going to go through it.
[05:12.570 --> 05:16.770]  But also excited to know that like, once she's through it, she's through it and she's set
[05:16.770 --> 05:17.450]  for the rest of her life.
[05:17.550 --> 05:18.870]  And so I'm fucking jazzed about that.
[05:19.010 --> 05:24.290]  That's the thing that made you really violently push out like a tiny little pea of shit, right?
[05:24.810 --> 05:26.730]  When you couldn't eat for that for so long?
[05:27.690 --> 05:29.290]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.
[05:29.350 --> 05:31.110]  My first dump after my surgery.
[05:31.850 --> 05:35.290]  And Millie had trouble dumping too after her surgery, I think, but I don't think it was
[05:35.290 --> 05:35.730]  as severe.
[05:36.490 --> 05:40.230]  Yeah, it took me three weeks to take a shit after my surgery and I finally did.
[05:40.490 --> 05:41.150]  And I cried.
[05:41.150 --> 05:41.210]  I cried.
[05:41.290 --> 05:41.890]  It hurt so bad.
[05:41.990 --> 05:45.050]  And when I looked down in the toilet, it was like the size of a peanut M&M.
[05:45.210 --> 05:45.690]  Oh my God.
[05:45.690 --> 05:49.230]  And it was covered in milk of magnesia because I had been drinking milk of magnesia all day.
[05:49.370 --> 05:57.430]  It was just like a white, goopy, white peanut M&M that ripped my asshole from my throat
[05:57.890 --> 05:58.790]  to my sphincter.
[05:58.890 --> 05:59.730]  Just ripped me up.
[05:59.790 --> 06:00.150]  It was brutal.
[06:00.290 --> 06:01.430]  Don't ever take three weeks off.
[06:01.510 --> 06:02.230]  I'm sorry.
[06:02.370 --> 06:03.450]  The body closes back up.
[06:03.850 --> 06:04.290]  You need to.
[06:04.450 --> 06:04.810]  You need to.
[06:04.850 --> 06:05.650]  You need to constantly.
[06:05.690 --> 06:06.570]  It's like Wolverine's claws.
[06:06.730 --> 06:08.170]  You need to constantly shit.
[06:08.170 --> 06:11.990]  You need to constantly use that hole or it'll close back up.
[06:12.090 --> 06:13.010]  Just like Wolverine's claws.
[06:13.010 --> 06:13.910]  Just like Wolverine's claws.
[06:14.190 --> 06:14.270]  Yeah.
[06:15.070 --> 06:15.470]  Okay.
[06:15.730 --> 06:16.970]  So Emily said yes.
[06:17.270 --> 06:18.930]  Millie had her surgery and it was a huge success.
[06:19.270 --> 06:20.910]  Other things that were good about 2022.
[06:21.750 --> 06:22.550]  Hitting baseballs.
[06:22.670 --> 06:22.850]  Yeah.
[06:23.090 --> 06:25.530]  I rediscovered a love of hitting baseballs.
[06:25.570 --> 06:28.270]  That was a huge bonus for me in 2022.
[06:28.890 --> 06:31.670]  Something that I hadn't done since I was probably 17 or 18 and I had forgotten about.
[06:31.970 --> 06:33.470]  And it brought me tons of joy.
[06:33.730 --> 06:34.290]  A lot of pain.
[06:34.430 --> 06:34.910]  Tons of joy.
[06:34.910 --> 06:38.910]  How have most people have been surprised and impressed with you in real life?
[06:39.190 --> 06:39.250]  Yeah.
[06:39.490 --> 06:41.510]  It was really impressive to see.
[06:41.790 --> 06:44.110]  Not this entire building that we're all working in in this industry.
[06:44.250 --> 06:44.330]  No.
[06:44.470 --> 06:46.070]  Because that happened really slowly over time.
[06:46.210 --> 06:46.370]  Okay.
[06:47.210 --> 06:49.790]  But that was like, no one was expecting that on that day.
[06:50.270 --> 06:52.310]  It was like, oh, it was like more of a gust thing too.
[06:52.870 --> 06:56.210]  I was driving around over the weekend and it was more of a gust thing.
[06:57.010 --> 06:57.810]  Jesus Christ.
[06:58.710 --> 06:59.110]  Yeah.
[06:59.490 --> 06:59.650]  Yeah.
[07:01.130 --> 07:01.790]  All right.
[07:01.810 --> 07:02.070]  Listen.
[07:03.370 --> 07:04.950]  I'm not going to talk shit about...
[07:04.950 --> 07:05.490]  Here's why.
[07:05.630 --> 07:10.250]  I'm going to refrain from engaging in that because I got to get through this list and
[07:10.250 --> 07:10.710]  you'll see why.
[07:13.290 --> 07:16.170]  Regardless, as an aside, I went by Roy G. Guerrero Park over the weekend.
[07:16.590 --> 07:17.450]  Great baseball fields.
[07:17.750 --> 07:19.550]  I don't know if that's an option for us.
[07:19.650 --> 07:20.330]  I could check it out.
[07:20.490 --> 07:21.110]  They're like...
[07:21.110 --> 07:22.870]  I think center field is like 340.
[07:23.090 --> 07:23.510]  Oh, nice.
[07:23.630 --> 07:24.230]  So it's pretty big.
[07:24.330 --> 07:25.370]  No way I can hit it out of that.
[07:25.410 --> 07:25.550]  Yeah.
[07:25.870 --> 07:26.710]  But I'd love to try.
[07:28.770 --> 07:30.030]  Next, TAP.
[07:30.750 --> 07:35.630]  I know TAP has existed for a long time, and certainly over in Europe and the UK.
[07:36.090 --> 07:37.150]  But I feel like...
[07:37.150 --> 07:37.710]  TAP?
[07:37.750 --> 07:38.690]  You tap your credit card to pay?
[07:39.150 --> 07:40.070]  I feel like...
[07:40.070 --> 07:40.450]  Oh!
[07:40.510 --> 07:41.830]  I feel like in 2022...
[07:42.390 --> 07:42.730]  TAP.
[07:43.010 --> 07:44.150]  I was trying to figure out what TAP is.
[07:44.150 --> 07:44.650]  Contactless payment.
[07:44.850 --> 07:46.010]  TAP finally.
[07:46.270 --> 07:46.610]  Really?
[07:46.730 --> 07:48.150]  Finally fucking works in America.
[07:48.270 --> 07:48.790]  It works well.
[07:48.830 --> 07:49.370]  That's crazy.
[07:49.430 --> 07:50.510]  The point where I use it...
[07:50.510 --> 07:50.950]  You said TAP to pay.
[07:51.050 --> 07:52.890]  I still thought you were talking about TAP dancing.
[07:53.110 --> 07:53.330]  No.
[07:53.430 --> 07:53.790]  TAP to pay.
[07:53.890 --> 07:54.850]  I was trying to figure out what TAP...
[07:54.850 --> 07:55.710]  I thought it was a beverage.
[07:55.710 --> 07:58.330]  I know it's existed before 2022, but I feel like now...
[07:58.330 --> 07:58.650]  The Irish.
[07:58.650 --> 08:02.970]  There's been enough turnover that like, HEBs and everywhere let you tap to pay now, and
[08:02.970 --> 08:03.890]  it works like a fucking...
[08:03.890 --> 08:05.050]  I thought he was confused about Tab-Da-Soda.
[08:05.750 --> 08:05.910]  Yeah.
[08:06.070 --> 08:07.210]  No, Tab-Da-Soda sucks.
[08:07.330 --> 08:10.710]  That's why I was really confused when you said it was one of the best things of 2022.
[08:10.930 --> 08:11.170]  Yeah, 2022.
[08:11.510 --> 08:11.890]  TAP.
[08:11.970 --> 08:12.830]  That's what I was thinking too.
[08:13.170 --> 08:13.530]  Deploy.
[08:14.850 --> 08:15.230]  What?
[08:15.830 --> 08:16.410]  Marcus Smart.
[08:16.570 --> 08:16.670]  What?
[08:16.810 --> 08:18.110]  Defensive Player of the Year.
[08:18.230 --> 08:18.430]  Oh.
[08:18.610 --> 08:22.650]  First time a guard has won Defensive Player of the Year in the NBA in over 20 years, since
[08:22.650 --> 08:27.430]  Gary Payton, the glove, did it, one of the greatest, maybe the greatest defensive guards
[08:27.430 --> 08:27.870]  of all time.
[08:27.870 --> 08:29.530]  That was a huge, huge win for me.
[08:30.070 --> 08:33.030]  And by the way, as of this recording, this isn't on the list, but as of this recording,
[08:33.150 --> 08:34.750]  the Boston Celtics are the best team in basketball.
[08:34.930 --> 08:35.630]  That's pretty awesome too.
[08:35.850 --> 08:36.530]  So, love that.
[08:37.130 --> 08:39.370]  Next thing, music.
[08:40.170 --> 08:41.650]  Really liked music in 2022.
[08:41.930 --> 08:42.230]  Really?
[08:42.330 --> 08:42.950]  Really enjoyed it.
[08:43.470 --> 08:43.830]  Next.
[08:44.230 --> 08:45.310]  Shabu Shabu.
[08:45.410 --> 08:45.730]  Nice.
[08:45.830 --> 08:46.130]  Well, wait.
[08:46.790 --> 08:47.430]  What's that, Andrew?
[08:47.810 --> 08:50.410]  I was just gonna say, do you have any music, like, specific music things that you think...
[08:50.410 --> 08:51.110]  Oh, I love...
[08:51.110 --> 08:53.030]  Tons of great music that I listened to in 2022.
[08:53.730 --> 08:54.510]  Really enjoyed it.
[08:54.750 --> 08:55.550]  Shabu Shabu.
[08:56.790 --> 08:57.150]  Okay.
[08:57.150 --> 08:57.850]  Fantastic.
[08:58.090 --> 08:59.170]  Love Shabu Shabu.
[08:59.250 --> 09:00.050]  Can't get enough of it.
[09:00.430 --> 09:01.550]  Been there with you.
[09:01.670 --> 09:02.290]  Been there with you.
[09:02.630 --> 09:03.630]  Everybody, but Nick, honestly.
[09:04.170 --> 09:04.810]  Sorry, Nick.
[09:05.510 --> 09:06.630]  Can't get enough Shabu Shabu.
[09:06.710 --> 09:08.930]  I hope 2023 has a lot of Shabu Shabu in it as well.
[09:09.650 --> 09:10.210]  Tiny Town.
[09:10.790 --> 09:11.290]  Oh, yeah.
[09:11.410 --> 09:12.710]  Really hit my stride with Tiny Town.
[09:12.830 --> 09:14.470]  You guys haven't seen the Christmas Village yet?
[09:14.890 --> 09:15.530]  We've seen...
[09:15.530 --> 09:15.810]  No.
[09:16.050 --> 09:16.710]  No, you've seen Halloween.
[09:16.830 --> 09:17.510]  You haven't seen the Christmas Village.
[09:17.510 --> 09:18.250]  I've seen Halloween.
[09:18.510 --> 09:19.230]  Haven't seen Christmas.
[09:19.410 --> 09:21.610]  Christmas Village is all Emily, but it is gorgeous.
[09:21.930 --> 09:24.850]  And we'll be filming a special anime podcast.
[09:24.850 --> 09:27.670]  Want to try to get that hopefully next week, but we can talk about it later.
[09:27.670 --> 09:28.230]  I'm all about that.
[09:29.470 --> 09:30.630]  Jock Itch Medicine.
[09:32.470 --> 09:34.930]  Didn't know it existed, assumed it existed.
[09:35.130 --> 09:36.430]  Didn't think I'd ever need it.
[09:36.830 --> 09:39.750]  Saved my life, eventually, slowly, over about six months.
[09:40.250 --> 09:42.350]  I think I'm like 98% of the way through with that.
[09:44.310 --> 09:46.050]  But it was a huge help.
[09:47.770 --> 09:48.170]  PS5.
[09:48.270 --> 09:49.590]  Got a PS5 in 2022?
[09:50.290 --> 09:50.790]  Pretty cool.
[09:51.170 --> 09:51.690]  Appreciate that.
[09:51.710 --> 09:52.330]  You got a war yet?
[09:52.530 --> 09:53.510]  No, I haven't taken it out of the box yet.
[09:54.830 --> 09:55.990]  I'm really jazzed about it.
[09:56.530 --> 09:57.630]  He's excited about it.
[09:57.710 --> 09:57.790]  Yep.
[09:58.270 --> 09:58.710]  And here's why.
[09:58.830 --> 09:59.450]  Here's the next one.
[09:59.510 --> 10:00.150]  You'll see why.
[10:00.870 --> 10:01.850]  Why I had to cut off the other thing.
[10:02.230 --> 10:02.430]  Gus.
[10:02.910 --> 10:03.050]  Yeah.
[10:03.470 --> 10:04.690]  Gus was great in 2022.
[10:05.110 --> 10:06.950]  Really, really enjoyed.
[10:07.110 --> 10:08.210]  It was a good Gus year.
[10:08.490 --> 10:11.950]  Really enjoyed interacting with him, making content with him again.
[10:11.970 --> 10:13.710]  We hadn't made content together in many years.
[10:14.410 --> 10:15.530]  And it was good.
[10:15.650 --> 10:16.190]  Gus was good.
[10:16.270 --> 10:20.490]  He sucked in some previous years, but 2022, he was fucking on point.
[10:20.570 --> 10:21.490]  It was a good Gus year.
[10:21.610 --> 10:22.750]  Is this the year of Anma?
[10:22.750 --> 10:24.090]  Is that when it started this year?
[10:24.350 --> 10:24.970]  Or was it last year?
[10:25.110 --> 10:25.450]  I don't know.
[10:25.630 --> 10:25.870]  It was this year.
[10:26.670 --> 10:27.030]  Really?
[10:27.170 --> 10:27.710]  Who can tell?
[10:28.710 --> 10:29.790]  Me and Nick can.
[10:30.110 --> 10:30.290]  Oh, okay.
[10:30.310 --> 10:30.730]  There you go.
[10:31.350 --> 10:32.030]  You listen to them.
[10:32.070 --> 10:32.530]  They probably know.
[10:33.790 --> 10:34.990]  And the last thing on my list.
[10:35.090 --> 10:39.050]  Oh, I figured a lot of people would put like TV and movies and stuff.
[10:39.410 --> 10:46.210]  I will say I discovered Real Housewives of Potomac in 2022, and that might have benefited
[10:46.210 --> 10:47.850]  me in more than anything else.
[10:48.190 --> 10:52.510]  No offense to Emily and Millie, but Real Housewives of Potomac is the greatest version of the
[10:52.510 --> 10:54.430]  Real Housewives franchises that I've ever seen.
[10:54.570 --> 10:55.830]  I'm instantly hooked.
[10:56.030 --> 10:57.850]  And I can't believe I slept so long.
[10:58.150 --> 10:59.650]  The Wendy Mia drama.
[10:59.930 --> 11:00.930]  Oh, my God.
[11:01.090 --> 11:05.430]  And let me tell you, you have the world's biggest fucking Karen stan right here.
[11:05.730 --> 11:06.570]  She is fucking awesome.
[11:06.770 --> 11:14.490]  I will also say 2022, a bit of a stumble for Salt Lake City, I think, a bit of a stumble
[11:14.490 --> 11:15.990]  for Salt Lake City, I think.
[11:16.150 --> 11:18.730]  I haven't enjoyed it as much this season as I wanted to.
[11:19.190 --> 11:25.150]  Also, largely not a great year for, and I think anybody who watched Housewives of Beverly
[11:25.150 --> 11:27.690]  Hills understands it wasn't a great year for the Beverly Hills women.
[11:28.190 --> 11:33.230]  However, I will say, they're even taking an extended break from the show before they
[11:33.230 --> 11:33.650]  record again.
[11:33.730 --> 11:36.090]  I will say this year was the redemption of Sutton.
[11:36.370 --> 11:38.370]  Started off really rough.
[11:38.870 --> 11:40.270]  Sutton has a way of putting her foot in her mouth.
[11:41.010 --> 11:49.350]  She caught some heat for not showing appropriate deference to... and she wasn't conciliatory
[11:49.350 --> 11:53.250]  at all to when Dorit got her house broken into and the guys almost killed her and her kids.
[11:53.770 --> 11:55.870]  And then she tried to equate that with...
[11:56.610 --> 11:56.890]  What?
[11:57.130 --> 11:57.350]  Yeah.
[11:57.530 --> 11:58.130]  So like Dorit...
[11:58.130 --> 11:58.350]  Did you say?
[11:58.450 --> 12:00.010]  Dorit, she was home one night.
[12:00.090 --> 12:00.930]  Her husband was out of town.
[12:02.050 --> 12:06.190]  Armed robbers came in, put a gun to her head, emptied out the whole house, told her they
[12:06.190 --> 12:08.790]  were going to kill her and the kids, and then they left her and she lived.
[12:08.790 --> 12:13.830]  And then when it was relayed to Sutton, she said, it's been one of those days.
[12:13.930 --> 12:17.250]  I had a designer coming in for a fashion show and his flight got canceled.
[12:17.750 --> 12:19.970]  And so people were like, that's not the same thing, you know?
[12:20.710 --> 12:21.930]  However, neck and neck.
[12:22.270 --> 12:28.050]  However, since that moment, Sutton has been phenomenal, on point, and the relationship
[12:28.050 --> 12:30.110]  between her and Garcelle, I live for it.
[12:30.270 --> 12:32.630]  They are the new core of the Housewives of Beverly Hills.
[12:33.150 --> 12:37.170]  So really looking forward to good things with them in the future.
[12:37.170 --> 12:37.770]  Thankful.
[12:38.430 --> 12:39.890]  This is way more than music.
[12:40.010 --> 12:44.070]  Remember when he started getting engaged and just moved on?
[12:44.450 --> 12:46.930]  Such a good year for music.
[12:49.270 --> 12:51.490]  Also, I listen to it every day.
[12:51.570 --> 12:53.310]  I listen to more music than anything else this year.
[12:53.350 --> 12:56.530]  More than any podcast, more than video games, well, I don't really play video games.
[12:56.770 --> 12:57.230]  More than anything.
[12:58.570 --> 13:00.470]  Last thing I have here, the mall.
[13:01.150 --> 13:02.550]  We've talked about it at AMBA briefly.
[13:02.710 --> 13:03.870]  The mall is back.
[13:03.930 --> 13:06.510]  I am telling you, if you are not hanging out at the mall.
[13:06.510 --> 13:07.610]  You are sleeping.
[13:07.750 --> 13:08.950]  You are missing out.
[13:09.190 --> 13:10.510]  The mall has returned.
[13:11.030 --> 13:11.750]  Indoor malls.
[13:12.070 --> 13:13.190]  We all thought they were dead.
[13:13.410 --> 13:15.250]  Barton Creek Mall is fucking awesome.
[13:15.570 --> 13:16.730]  It is a hive of activity.
[13:16.830 --> 13:20.930]  They got stores you've never heard of in that mall and they're all popping off.
[13:21.090 --> 13:22.150]  Most of them are not franchised.
[13:22.250 --> 13:23.130]  They're just like weird ones.
[13:23.210 --> 13:24.470]  I went to the mall the other day.
[13:24.750 --> 13:25.110]  Oh my God.
[13:25.330 --> 13:26.770]  I was so blown away.
[13:26.830 --> 13:27.790]  I had to take Millie and Emily.
[13:28.110 --> 13:28.750]  Took Millie and Emily.
[13:29.230 --> 13:29.790]  We're there.
[13:29.890 --> 13:31.130]  Millie is super trepidatious.
[13:31.250 --> 13:34.090]  She's like, and I go, well, I'm sure all your friends hang out at the mall, right?
[13:34.290 --> 13:36.130]  Millie's like, no, none of my friends hang out at the mall.
[13:36.130 --> 13:37.170]  We go to the food court.
[13:37.470 --> 13:40.570]  We were in the food court for three seconds before we hear, Millie!
[13:41.050 --> 13:41.470]  Turn around.
[13:41.890 --> 13:43.670]  36 of her friends are hanging out at the mall.
[13:43.770 --> 13:45.150]  She just wasn't invited to the mall?
[13:45.670 --> 13:47.350]  She was just, I was just like, I thought your friends don't go to the mall.
[13:47.430 --> 13:49.870]  She's like, I guess I thought they didn't either.
[13:50.010 --> 13:50.310]  Oh shit.
[13:50.310 --> 13:50.950]  Found out they do.
[13:51.130 --> 13:52.130]  And apparently they're not inviting her.
[13:52.230 --> 13:53.590]  So we'll have to fucking get rid of that.
[13:54.810 --> 13:55.130]  Busted.
[13:55.410 --> 13:59.790]  So the fucking, they got Tiny Town at the Dillard's at the mall, which is, you know,
[13:59.830 --> 14:01.790]  I've been driving to Fredericksburg to get that shit.
[14:01.930 --> 14:04.830]  Or like what we really do, because it's so goddamn expensive.
[14:04.830 --> 14:06.050]  You got to go to estate sales.
[14:06.150 --> 14:08.770]  You guys don't know this, but every weekend I go to estate sales with Emily to look for
[14:08.770 --> 14:12.170]  Tiny Town, mostly to buy it from dead people because it's cheaper that way.
[14:14.590 --> 14:18.390]  One thing about the mall, went to the, you know, do you guys know about the Cheesecake
[14:18.390 --> 14:18.690]  Factory?
[14:18.850 --> 14:21.670]  How I've been trying to go to the Cheesecake Factory for about six months and any time
[14:21.670 --> 14:25.530]  I try to go, there's like a two, you can't, there's a two and a half hour wait.
[14:25.810 --> 14:28.350]  Anytime you try to go to the Cheesecake Factory, there's a huge wait.
[14:28.350 --> 14:28.770]  You get it for delivery?
[14:29.170 --> 14:29.670]  Huge wait.
[14:29.710 --> 14:32.350]  We went for, we went for face jam in the middle of the day on Tuesday.
[14:32.530 --> 14:33.770]  There was like a 10 minute wait.
[14:33.770 --> 14:35.750]  Usually it worked, but I mean, we could do it in the daytime.
[14:35.910 --> 14:37.630]  However, we tried to go to dinner at Cheesecake Factory.
[14:37.730 --> 14:39.050]  They're like, sorry, that'd be a seven hour wait.
[14:39.150 --> 14:40.670]  You're trying to go to dinner at the Cheesecake Factory?
[14:40.670 --> 14:40.890]  What are you, Uchiko?
[14:41.210 --> 14:44.790]  And they're like, yeah, no, you could get into Uchiko, you can't get into Cheesecake
[14:44.790 --> 14:45.050]  Factory.
[14:45.850 --> 14:47.690]  Found out Barbeque Mall has a Cheesecake Factory?
[14:47.830 --> 14:47.990]  Yes.
[14:48.130 --> 14:48.890]  Finally went in?
[14:49.010 --> 14:49.950]  Let me tell you something.
[14:50.070 --> 14:50.250]  Yeah.
[14:50.370 --> 14:51.110]  It fucking sucks.
[14:51.270 --> 14:51.530]  Yes.
[14:51.730 --> 14:53.030]  I don't like Cheesecake Factory at all.
[14:53.150 --> 14:55.670]  That's why me and Nick just kept looking at each other like, why the fuck are you doing
[14:55.670 --> 14:55.950]  this?
[14:56.070 --> 15:02.750]  Yeah, Emily and Superfan Vanessa have been talking it up for years and it's, it's a dump.
[15:02.750 --> 15:07.210]  Well, it surely can't be good when there's, uh, 78 different items on the menu.
[15:07.310 --> 15:08.110]  Well, that's the thing.
[15:08.250 --> 15:10.110]  Avocado egg rolls or pancakes.
[15:10.730 --> 15:18.710]  There is the book, the menu is the size of like the mechanics guide for like a 1972 Ford
[15:18.710 --> 15:19.250]  F150.
[15:19.530 --> 15:19.610]  Yes.
[15:19.630 --> 15:22.190]  So much the size of your Ramsey Golf Club.
[15:22.190 --> 15:23.030]  Yeah, it's massive.
[15:23.190 --> 15:24.770]  It's like an entire cookbook.
[15:25.370 --> 15:28.010]  I, uh, one thing I ordered, I thought, oh, I don't know what to get.
[15:28.130 --> 15:30.210]  There's so many things called factory here.
[15:30.210 --> 15:32.870]  Factory chicken, factory, hot chicken.
[15:33.270 --> 15:35.310]  I don't want anything named factory, right?
[15:35.770 --> 15:38.510]  So, and I realized I'm in a place called the Cheesecake Factory, but I didn't think they'd
[15:38.510 --> 15:40.650]  be so on the nose with the, with the structure.
[15:41.330 --> 15:46.530]  So I, I thought, well, I'll just get a club sandwich because it's not a factory club sandwich
[15:46.530 --> 15:47.250]  or a club factory sandwich.
[15:47.650 --> 15:48.550]  They were out of turkey.
[15:50.570 --> 15:53.650]  Now Emily says, why the fuck would you order turkey the day after Thanksgiving?
[15:54.250 --> 15:55.710]  But I think it's a fair point.
[15:55.710 --> 15:56.950]  I think it's a fair point.
[15:57.130 --> 16:02.750]  But if you get 19 turkey menu meals on your menu, I think you'd have turkey.
[16:02.850 --> 16:03.170]  You think?
[16:03.290 --> 16:03.750]  I think it's bullshit.
[16:05.330 --> 16:08.110]  Anyway, that's, uh, that's my, so that's 2022.
[16:08.750 --> 16:11.470]  That displays the depth of the menu, though, like a restaurant.
[16:11.690 --> 16:14.910]  They still have 80% of the menu available and they're missing 19 dishes.
[16:15.150 --> 16:15.750]  Like, it's absurd.
[16:15.930 --> 16:16.410]  I've never been.
[16:16.410 --> 16:20.410]  Yeah, I've had lots of turkey takes out like a fifth of the entire menu.
[16:20.530 --> 16:22.110]  And suddenly all I wanted was turkey.
[16:22.310 --> 16:23.690]  I have a question about your list, Geoff.
[16:23.770 --> 16:23.950]  Okay.
[16:24.390 --> 16:27.010]  Now you mentioned tiny homes and you go to estate sales.
[16:27.310 --> 16:29.210]  Is this a good year for dead people?
[16:29.570 --> 16:29.950]  What's that?
[16:30.430 --> 16:33.630]  Is this a good year for dead people, like for acquiring tiny towns?
[16:34.110 --> 16:35.270]  Have you had a good haul this year?
[16:35.290 --> 16:40.770]  Let me just say that, uh, the last like two or three years have been, there've been a
[16:40.770 --> 16:41.650]  lot of estate sales.
[16:41.990 --> 16:46.510]  Is there like a dead list, like a Craigslist for just that kind of thing, or do you have
[16:46.510 --> 16:47.510]  to physically go to them?
[16:47.690 --> 16:48.150]  What do you mean?
[16:48.830 --> 16:50.570]  Oh, is there like a Craigslist for estate sales?
[16:50.690 --> 16:51.290]  Yeah, for the dead.
[16:51.370 --> 16:51.530]  Yeah.
[16:52.050 --> 16:54.950]  Well, I mean, an estate sale doesn't mean they died.
[16:55.130 --> 16:57.210]  It could mean that they moved into assisted living.
[16:57.750 --> 17:01.110]  It could mean they decided to go move in with their family in Florida and they just want
[17:01.110 --> 17:02.150]  to sell all their crap.
[17:02.150 --> 17:02.390]  They just don't need this stuff.
[17:02.490 --> 17:02.670]  Yeah.
[17:02.990 --> 17:03.210]  God.
[17:03.350 --> 17:08.110]  It doesn't necessarily mean dead, but that's part of the fun of going to an estate sale
[17:08.110 --> 17:10.750]  is you walk around, you look at the house, you look at the state of it, and then you
[17:10.750 --> 17:11.310]  play the game.
[17:11.510 --> 17:12.370]  What happened to these people?
[17:13.670 --> 17:16.350]  It's like when you see snow without footprints in front of someone's door.
[17:16.650 --> 17:16.790]  Yeah.
[17:16.830 --> 17:17.890]  It's exactly like that.
[17:18.150 --> 17:18.950]  Guess who might be dead.
[17:19.130 --> 17:19.230]  Yeah.
[17:19.230 --> 17:24.050]  Do you think typically these people are moving somewhere else or do you think they're moving
[17:24.050 --> 17:24.590]  on?
[17:24.850 --> 17:25.790]  Emily finds out.
[17:25.830 --> 17:25.970]  Oh.
[17:26.590 --> 17:27.910]  And I'd say it's probably 50-50.
[17:28.090 --> 17:28.550]  Oh, wow.
[17:28.670 --> 17:29.490]  She has ways of finding out.
[17:29.730 --> 17:29.810]  Wow.
[17:29.890 --> 17:30.230]  She's good.
[17:30.330 --> 17:30.730]  That's pretty cool.
[17:30.770 --> 17:31.770]  Like leading questions and stuff.
[17:31.830 --> 17:32.090]  Yeah.
[17:32.370 --> 17:32.610]  Google.
[17:32.930 --> 17:36.110]  It turns out when people die, it's reported.
[17:36.410 --> 17:36.590]  Oh, yeah.
[17:36.590 --> 17:37.370]  So you can look it up.
[17:38.650 --> 17:40.190]  So I would say it's like 50-50 probably.
[17:40.650 --> 17:44.450]  But I mean, anybody that's had to buy a Department 56 Village knows how expensive they are.
[17:44.770 --> 17:48.110]  Way easier to buy them to people who don't need them anymore.
[17:48.110 --> 17:48.790]  How much are we talking?
[17:49.410 --> 17:55.190]  One of those little houses costs like 140 bucks or 15 if you buy it from somebody who's
[17:55.190 --> 17:55.870]  no longer alive.
[17:59.710 --> 18:02.250]  Well, that's a great roundup from Geoff.
[18:02.350 --> 18:03.010]  Yes, that's 2022.
[18:03.650 --> 18:04.690]  That's fantastic.
[18:05.130 --> 18:06.290]  That's an extensive list.
[18:06.430 --> 18:12.210]  Emily, Millie, Tap, Gus, Mall, Music, Shabu-Shabu.
[18:12.310 --> 18:13.030]  That's pretty much it, right?
[18:13.030 --> 18:13.270]  That's pretty good.
[18:13.610 --> 18:14.210]  Not bad.
[18:14.510 --> 18:15.090]  All right, who's next?
[18:15.490 --> 18:16.070]  I can go next.
[18:16.070 --> 18:18.230]  I feel like I'm probably more prepared than Gavin.
[18:18.390 --> 18:19.830]  I don't have Millie as much as you, Geoff.
[18:20.010 --> 18:21.650]  I have three things as well.
[18:22.130 --> 18:27.810]  The first is, has anyone here seen the Yellow Belly sketch from SCTV?
[18:28.750 --> 18:30.230]  No, I don't remember it.
[18:30.370 --> 18:34.390]  So SCTV was this sketch comedy show, and it was in like the 80s, I want to say.
[18:34.470 --> 18:35.550]  It was a Canadian-based one.
[18:35.830 --> 18:41.590]  It was an insanely stacked cast of like John Candy, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara.
[18:43.250 --> 18:44.550]  Was Martin Short in SCTV?
[18:45.010 --> 18:45.870]  No, he wasn't.
[18:45.870 --> 18:46.310]  No?
[18:46.490 --> 18:46.850]  No.
[18:47.670 --> 18:48.270]  Who else?
[18:48.650 --> 18:49.370]  Dave Thomas.
[18:49.470 --> 18:51.110]  Dave Thomas, yeah.
[18:51.270 --> 18:51.830]  He's in it.
[18:52.450 --> 18:53.750]  Harold Ramis was in it.
[18:53.870 --> 18:54.770]  It's fantastic.
[18:55.330 --> 18:58.090]  So I've been going back and watching that because as a kid, it would air on Comedy Central
[18:58.090 --> 18:59.910]  for me, but I was too young.
[19:00.070 --> 19:01.570]  Like, I just didn't get any of the humor.
[19:01.650 --> 19:03.930]  It was sort of like a weird show, and I just changed channels.
[19:04.030 --> 19:08.110]  So I've been going back, and I've been revisiting SCTV, and it doesn't always land.
[19:08.530 --> 19:13.290]  But when you have so many comedic legends in like a show, it's just so fascinating to watch
[19:13.290 --> 19:13.530]  them.
[19:13.530 --> 19:14.290]  And they're so...
[19:14.290 --> 19:17.590]  Like, even when the joke isn't that funny, they're just such great performers.
[19:18.130 --> 19:22.890]  This is my favorite sketch, and it's a little on the nose with the Vancouver Child Kicker
[19:22.890 --> 19:25.830]  thing, but I'm sending it to Eric for you guys to watch.
[19:26.450 --> 19:27.630]  It's called Yellow Belly.
[19:28.150 --> 19:29.110]  And I just...
[19:29.110 --> 19:30.790]  I've seen this like 20 times at this point.
[19:30.850 --> 19:31.190]  I laugh.
[19:31.230 --> 19:32.250]  It was almost...
[19:32.250 --> 19:33.050]  Well, I'll explain after.
[19:33.330 --> 19:33.610]  Okay.
[19:33.830 --> 19:34.350]  I'm unmuting.
[19:34.790 --> 19:35.450]  Here we go.
[19:36.570 --> 19:40.270]  So they do these shows where it's like fake shows that they've made within their station.
[19:40.530 --> 19:41.150]  Sort of the premise.
[19:41.150 --> 19:52.920]  Is it John Candy?
[19:53.180 --> 19:53.380]  Yep.
[19:53.980 --> 19:54.180]  Yep.
[19:54.600 --> 19:55.340]  Scared of a child.
[19:57.100 --> 19:57.640]  What?
[20:09.180 --> 20:10.280]  Is that Catherine O'Hare?
[20:10.880 --> 20:11.120]  Yeah.
[20:14.180 --> 20:16.500]  Oh, this sketch is really funny.
[20:18.560 --> 20:19.100]  Dude.
[20:19.100 --> 20:19.920]  Oh my god.
[20:20.780 --> 20:22.160]  Dude, that rules.
[20:22.480 --> 20:23.800]  That's really funny.
[20:23.820 --> 20:25.360]  Oh my god.
[20:25.560 --> 20:26.000]  Dude.
[20:26.480 --> 20:28.780]  That's going to make their scene together in Home Alone way funnier.
[20:29.400 --> 20:29.940]  Dude.
[20:30.300 --> 20:30.760]  Oh my god.
[20:30.760 --> 20:34.080]  I'm a big fan of a get in, get out sketch premise.
[20:34.100 --> 20:36.540]  And that one gets in and gets out.
[20:36.580 --> 20:37.920]  It gets out hard.
[20:38.100 --> 20:39.000]  What a blast.
[20:39.720 --> 20:41.380]  Everything about it makes me...
[20:41.380 --> 20:46.640]  The impact the child has when being shot is so funny to me and that they're in frame the
[20:46.640 --> 20:47.400]  entire time.
[20:47.540 --> 20:48.180]  That's very funny.
[20:48.320 --> 20:48.480]  Oh.
[20:48.780 --> 20:53.000]  I almost wanted to draft that kid in my fall list as an inspiration, but I knew we were
[20:53.000 --> 20:53.540]  doing this.
[20:53.860 --> 20:55.080]  Great 2022 moment.
[20:55.400 --> 20:55.880]  Yeah.
[20:56.160 --> 20:57.080]  Oh, it's brought...
[20:57.080 --> 20:57.560]  Watch...
[20:57.560 --> 20:58.480]  Oh, it's so great.
[20:58.480 --> 21:04.440]  Just the premise of that is like a Criminal Minds like show, like on, oh, it's so funny.
[21:05.040 --> 21:06.640]  Uh, so that, that was that.
[21:07.200 --> 21:10.180]  My second thing, I, I play a lot of games.
[21:10.240 --> 21:11.900]  I don't talk about it a lot on the show.
[21:12.060 --> 21:13.900]  It's probably my favorite hobby.
[21:14.300 --> 21:15.040]  I invest a lot into.
[21:15.140 --> 21:19.600]  So I just wrote down some indie games that I really enjoyed from this year that I'd recommend
[21:19.600 --> 21:22.260]  people check out that don't get necessarily a lot of attention.
[21:22.740 --> 21:26.440]  Almost all of these are on Game Pass, but I think they're also multi-platform.
[21:26.820 --> 21:27.280]  A lot of them.
[21:27.280 --> 21:33.040]  So my list of indie games that I would recommend are Tinykin, which is, I don't know if anyone
[21:33.040 --> 21:33.940]  here has played Pikmin.
[21:34.380 --> 21:34.560]  Yeah.
[21:34.640 --> 21:34.840]  Oh yeah.
[21:34.920 --> 21:35.700]  It's very Pikmin-like.
[21:36.200 --> 21:40.700]  It's like Pikmin, but no combat, which I know doesn't necessarily sound fun, but it's just
[21:40.700 --> 21:45.180]  this super meditative game where you play this like tiny little person who's running around
[21:45.180 --> 21:49.400]  this house from the eighties and you have to try to collect ship pieces to like return
[21:49.400 --> 21:49.720]  home.
[21:49.820 --> 21:50.080]  Okay.
[21:50.180 --> 21:51.180]  And you're collecting Poland.
[21:51.340 --> 21:53.960]  So it's like kind of a collect-a-thon, but it's really low key.
[21:54.580 --> 21:55.380]  It's awesome.
[21:55.540 --> 21:56.360]  It's so much fun.
[21:56.360 --> 21:57.360]  Ship with a P, right?
[21:57.540 --> 21:58.200]  Ship pieces?
[21:58.220 --> 21:58.500]  Yes.
[21:58.920 --> 21:59.140]  Okay.
[21:59.240 --> 21:59.500]  Yes.
[22:00.300 --> 22:00.740]  Yeah.
[22:01.180 --> 22:02.000]  That's shit pieces.
[22:02.240 --> 22:02.620]  Oh, okay.
[22:02.740 --> 22:03.540]  It's a different game.
[22:03.600 --> 22:03.960]  Got it.
[22:04.280 --> 22:06.200]  I've never played a shit piece collect-a-thon.
[22:06.320 --> 22:08.080]  There's too much shit in this game.
[22:08.360 --> 22:09.480]  Which can't be happening.
[22:09.520 --> 22:10.500]  Like that's a collect-a-thon thing.
[22:10.720 --> 22:10.980]  Anyway.
[22:11.420 --> 22:11.960]  Next game.
[22:12.480 --> 22:13.740]  Uh, Nobody Saves the World.
[22:14.320 --> 22:16.460]  It's a really impressive RPG, small team.
[22:16.800 --> 22:19.000]  As I said on Game Pass, I think it's on multiple platforms.
[22:19.660 --> 22:20.460]  It's a lot of fun.
[22:20.560 --> 22:22.120]  It's really inventive for what it is.
[22:22.680 --> 22:24.640]  It's a kind of unique art style.
[22:25.260 --> 22:26.360]  It's just a good game.
[22:26.440 --> 22:27.720]  I'd highly recommend checking that out.
[22:28.060 --> 22:31.660]  And then my last one is Research and Destroy, which is like a hard to explain.
[22:32.200 --> 22:36.340]  It's like a turn-based but you move action shooter game.
[22:36.480 --> 22:37.320]  It's co-op.
[22:37.740 --> 22:38.120]  It's...
[22:38.120 --> 22:40.180]  I should have written down like that.
[22:40.180 --> 22:40.800]  No, you're doing a great job.
[22:40.920 --> 22:41.720]  I played it back in...
[22:41.720 --> 22:42.400]  No, I'm doing terrible.
[22:42.740 --> 22:43.960]  But I wrote it...
[22:43.960 --> 22:44.960]  I played it in like February.
[22:45.740 --> 22:46.460]  It's a great game.
[22:46.720 --> 22:48.520]  I've never heard anyone else recommend it.
[22:48.840 --> 22:49.280]  Give it a try.
[22:49.680 --> 22:49.800]  Yeah.
[22:53.950 --> 22:57.070]  I'm sorry I couldn't be more detailed than music was great this year.
[22:57.070 --> 22:57.610]  It was.
[22:57.710 --> 22:59.110]  Did you also enjoy music this year?
[23:01.430 --> 23:02.190]  Not especially...
[23:02.190 --> 23:03.190]  A little bit, I guess.
[23:03.270 --> 23:04.490]  But no, I wouldn't say it was a great music year.
[23:04.490 --> 23:05.750]  You enjoyed a little bit of music this year.
[23:06.750 --> 23:10.690]  Another thing that I don't know if we've ever talked about on the show, but it's extended
[23:11.390 --> 23:17.530]  into this year, is when Gavin and I play Halo, we'll be talking, we'll be having fun, whenever
[23:17.530 --> 23:21.810]  he gets a lead near the end of the game, he calls it a screenshot game.
[23:22.170 --> 23:25.830]  And he said he would screenshot any time he had more kills than I had.
[23:25.890 --> 23:28.070]  Yeah, I just screenshot the leaderboard at the end.
[23:28.370 --> 23:31.230]  And it creates this frantic race.
[23:31.890 --> 23:34.250]  And it's, I enjoy it immensely.
[23:34.410 --> 23:42.150]  It's extended into absurd side bets, and eventually led into a thing, Gavin tried to, we're talking
[23:42.150 --> 23:44.650]  about, you know how there are like names for numbers, Geoff?
[23:44.730 --> 23:45.910]  So like you have a baker's dozen.
[23:46.470 --> 23:48.790]  That's like a name for a thing.
[23:48.910 --> 23:51.570]  We're doing, we're talking about that.
[23:51.790 --> 23:53.250]  And we're listing the different ones.
[23:53.490 --> 23:55.770]  And then Gavin said something.
[23:56.210 --> 23:57.790]  And I said, that's not real.
[23:57.990 --> 24:01.150]  That's a fake, like, that's the worst fake name I've ever heard.
[24:01.230 --> 24:04.730]  Well, because we, because I think first I suggested like a score, it's like 20.
[24:05.290 --> 24:05.630]  Is that right?
[24:05.990 --> 24:06.270]  Yeah.
[24:06.590 --> 24:11.250]  We're setting like lines, like what you would call different leads you'd have in kills for
[24:11.250 --> 24:11.470]  this.
[24:11.950 --> 24:14.250]  And I don't remember what you said the word was.
[24:14.250 --> 24:16.390]  He said, he was trying to, we're like going back and forth.
[24:16.470 --> 24:17.390]  And he tried to trick me.
[24:17.470 --> 24:19.750]  And it was the worst lie I've ever heard.
[24:19.890 --> 24:21.410]  It was so blatantly a lie.
[24:21.750 --> 24:22.610]  I was like, that's fake.
[24:22.910 --> 24:25.350]  And Gavin immediately broke and started laughing.
[24:25.890 --> 24:28.790]  And I said, how many, what would that have represented?
[24:29.070 --> 24:31.290]  What amount of, he said 67.
[24:32.130 --> 24:35.110]  Nobody needs a term for 67 items.
[24:35.750 --> 24:39.930]  What has turned into a problem is I forgot what he said and he refuses to tell me.
[24:40.390 --> 24:47.290]  This has been a weeks long struggle, like several months at this point of me trying
[24:47.290 --> 24:51.690]  to figure out what this is, me trying different strategies to get him to tell me, pretending
[24:51.690 --> 24:56.310]  I don't care about it, acting like it never, I've tried everything and it's infuriating,
[24:56.690 --> 24:57.890]  but it has to be on my list.
[24:57.990 --> 24:59.070]  It's for 67?
[25:00.390 --> 25:01.630]  67, I believe.
[25:01.730 --> 25:03.910]  I know my, I was going to check on my phone what he said.
[25:04.210 --> 25:09.110]  Well, let me tell you, Gavin very graciously just wrote it down on a piece of paper and
[25:09.110 --> 25:11.410]  gave it to us, so we all know what it's called now too.
[25:11.670 --> 25:12.890]  That's so mean!
[25:15.030 --> 25:16.290]  That's so rude!
[25:16.530 --> 25:17.670]  Nick, I want you to see it too.
[25:17.870 --> 25:18.630]  God damn it.
[25:19.550 --> 25:22.410]  I don't even remember my guess, but okay.
[25:22.670 --> 25:24.770]  Just so we're clear, he's never going to guess that.
[25:24.770 --> 25:26.330]  Never in a million years when he gets there.
[25:26.330 --> 25:32.490]  I tried to do it totally casually, I was like, yeah, bake a dozen, 13, score is like 20,
[25:32.690 --> 25:38.570]  and then X is 70, 67, and then I broke like halfway through.
[25:38.570 --> 25:42.490]  But looking at that word, isn't it the fakest sounding word you've ever heard?
[25:42.670 --> 25:44.290]  No, no, it's totally plausible to me.
[25:45.490 --> 25:49.690]  It's a very, it's a very Hubert Adams type thing where if Gavin said it to me, I would
[25:49.690 --> 25:51.150]  go that's too stupid to not be real.
[25:51.730 --> 25:54.650]  Like this is not where I, I'm not going to die on this hill with you again.
[25:54.970 --> 25:56.290]  I would instantly believe it.
[25:56.810 --> 25:57.450]  That's fascinating.
[25:57.710 --> 25:58.570]  Well, I don't know what it is.
[25:58.670 --> 25:59.810]  I'm still infuriated by it.
[25:59.850 --> 26:03.650]  I fucking hate, I didn't expect that this would turn into all of you knowing as well.
[26:03.750 --> 26:06.490]  When you guess it correctly, I will tell you that you've got it.
[26:07.250 --> 26:08.190]  That's the problem.
[26:08.310 --> 26:08.410]  Yeah.
[26:08.450 --> 26:11.410]  I don't even remember what my guesses were, but I kept, I was stuck.
[26:11.430 --> 26:12.830]  What do you remember about the word?
[26:13.270 --> 26:15.990]  I don't remember anything at this point, which makes it even worse.
[26:16.110 --> 26:16.890]  Like before...
[26:16.890 --> 26:20.530]  Because in conversation in the game, we, we both said it probably 25 times.
[26:20.850 --> 26:21.530]  Oh, absolutely.
[26:21.770 --> 26:23.670]  And then I forgot it two games later.
[26:24.050 --> 26:25.890]  What it's like is like the name of it.
[26:26.010 --> 26:29.470]  It's like we're in the water and I'm constantly drifting further away.
[26:29.510 --> 26:30.730]  And now I'm miles away.
[26:30.730 --> 26:33.250]  I have no trace of what direction to go in.
[26:33.250 --> 26:37.330]  I feel like every time you've guessed, it's just gotten you further away from it.
[26:37.470 --> 26:39.550]  Like you don't even know which direction land is, right?
[26:40.030 --> 26:41.010]  Yeah, exactly.
[26:41.270 --> 26:46.050]  My favorite thing about doing the screenshot games is that like Andrew and I talk a lot.
[26:46.190 --> 26:51.410]  We very casually play, even ranked, but it'll get to the point where it's like, I have 16
[26:51.410 --> 26:57.010]  kills and he has 12 and eventually he'll just stop talking because I realized he's noticed
[26:57.010 --> 26:57.770]  the scoreboard.
[26:58.070 --> 26:58.590]  He's dialed in.
[26:58.790 --> 26:59.630]  He goes dead silent.
[26:59.630 --> 27:05.310]  And all I hear is like grunting and like, as he's like really trying to play really
[27:05.310 --> 27:07.250]  hard to get ahead of me right towards the end of the game.
[27:07.650 --> 27:09.130]  It's definitely my favorite thing about playing with him.
[27:09.490 --> 27:10.030]  It's great.
[27:10.410 --> 27:13.730]  I wish there was a way we could tell the entire world what this name is.
[27:13.790 --> 27:14.610]  Yeah, there's no way.
[27:14.710 --> 27:15.170]  You can't.
[27:15.310 --> 27:17.790]  I want every regulation listener and comment leaver to know.
[27:17.970 --> 27:18.250]  What about this?
[27:18.650 --> 27:19.530]  And you're not going to...
[27:19.530 --> 27:21.330]  I will put my headset down.
[27:21.370 --> 27:21.550]  No.
[27:21.630 --> 27:22.950]  And I will not listen to this.
[27:22.970 --> 27:23.150]  Nope.
[27:23.190 --> 27:23.310]  No.
[27:23.470 --> 27:24.090]  100% no.
[27:24.130 --> 27:24.330]  No.
[27:24.570 --> 27:28.190]  What we will do is figure out a way to leak it into the content without you realizing
[27:28.190 --> 27:28.410]  it.
[27:29.190 --> 27:29.630]  Interesting.
[27:29.630 --> 27:31.070]  I like that idea a lot.
[27:31.250 --> 27:31.350]  Great.
[27:31.970 --> 27:33.850]  That's a fantastic plan.
[27:34.410 --> 27:38.270]  And the last thing, and I already talked about it, so it's not it's not a great, great topic
[27:38.270 --> 27:42.250]  to have for my end, but it truly is one of my funniest things of this year.
[27:42.510 --> 27:49.790]  It's been consistent every year is how our audience takes things and just creates something
[27:49.790 --> 27:50.870]  ridiculous and absurd.
[27:50.950 --> 27:53.190]  It's been the Christmas albums in the past.
[27:53.730 --> 27:55.890]  This year, it was anal passage for me.
[27:55.970 --> 27:56.170]  Yeah.
[27:56.170 --> 27:59.930]  It was this thing that was supposed to be up for like a day or two and then be pulled.
[28:00.410 --> 28:04.330]  And then they turned it into the number one shirt in the store.
[28:05.170 --> 28:06.890]  It's so fucking funny.
[28:07.590 --> 28:10.590]  It's such a lame, lame isn't the right word, but it's such a general thing.
[28:10.650 --> 28:11.550]  But Geoff said music.
[28:11.990 --> 28:16.750]  But our community is consistently one of my favorite things of each year and the ways
[28:16.750 --> 28:18.810]  that they surprise me and how funny and creative they are.
[28:19.370 --> 28:23.250]  I really love tracing stuff back, like the origins of how stuff happened.
[28:23.250 --> 28:29.010]  Anal passage, I think, came from the video of you and Jack trying Bovril.
[28:29.050 --> 28:30.330]  It was just some random thing.
[28:30.730 --> 28:31.270]  It was in England.
[28:31.530 --> 28:31.570]  Yeah.
[28:31.870 --> 28:33.610]  It was like his shirt was folded.
[28:33.990 --> 28:34.710]  It looked like it said anal passage.
[28:35.230 --> 28:39.530]  Or like I was thinking about this the other day, fucking The Monkey Movie, which we finally
[28:39.530 --> 28:46.330]  watched in VP2, was first referenced like in episode four of this podcast.
[28:46.670 --> 28:51.850]  Like episode four of F***face, Andrew mentions MVP2 and then again in episode five, he goes
[28:51.850 --> 28:52.950]  like into it in detail.
[28:53.430 --> 28:57.950]  And we watched it around episode 128, talking about like tracing it back.
[28:58.150 --> 28:58.750]  It's ridiculous.
[28:59.950 --> 29:01.550]  I love that we get stuff done on this podcast.
[29:02.270 --> 29:03.890]  The ideas eventually happen.
[29:06.010 --> 29:07.670]  It's tough, but we do it.
[29:09.190 --> 29:10.350]  That's a good list.
[29:10.450 --> 29:11.590]  That's a great list, Andrew.
[29:11.730 --> 29:11.890]  That's a great list.
[29:11.890 --> 29:12.270]  I love it.
[29:12.610 --> 29:13.230]  Fantastic list.
[29:13.910 --> 29:14.070]  Gavin?
[29:14.950 --> 29:21.570]  My favorite thing about 2022 is not having to worry about whether one of our stupid
[29:21.570 --> 29:22.350]  bits works.
[29:22.610 --> 29:28.290]  Like I went to the pizza cooking day with absolutely no fear that we would walk away
[29:28.290 --> 29:33.310]  with a really funny video, which I think we should... we can watch my cut after this
[29:33.310 --> 29:33.810]  as well, by the way.
[29:33.850 --> 29:34.390]  I'd love to.
[29:34.510 --> 29:35.070]  That'd be fun.
[29:35.290 --> 29:36.210]  Yeah, we can definitely do that.
[29:36.350 --> 29:40.330]  But yeah, just knowing in advance like this is just going to be good no matter what.
[29:40.350 --> 29:44.030]  And I think that's pretty special and it doesn't happen with everything you work on.
[29:44.110 --> 29:44.230]  Yeah.
[29:44.270 --> 29:46.490]  So hubris was one of the things you liked about 2022.
[29:49.130 --> 29:49.550]  Got it.
[29:49.730 --> 29:50.050]  Overconfidence.
[29:50.230 --> 29:50.370]  Yeah.
[29:50.430 --> 29:50.570]  No.
[29:52.230 --> 29:54.670]  Well, you could interpret it that way.
[29:55.250 --> 29:56.070]  You could, yeah.
[29:56.510 --> 29:58.230]  Hitting a home run every at-bat.
[29:58.490 --> 29:58.730]  No problem.
[30:02.570 --> 30:03.510]  Undo send.
[30:04.410 --> 30:05.190]  New feature.
[30:05.410 --> 30:06.650]  I thought...
[30:06.650 --> 30:06.870]  That's great.
[30:06.970 --> 30:12.830]  I don't think I don't see myself ever using that until I was texting Jackie Butler, Alfredo's
[30:12.830 --> 30:18.330]  partner, who was playing God of War right before the next one came out, God of War Ragnarok.
[30:18.330 --> 30:20.930]  And I sent her a text because I knew she'd been streaming it.
[30:21.150 --> 30:25.330]  And after God of War Ragnarok came out, I sent her a text saying, are you on the rag
[30:25.330 --> 30:25.570]  yet?
[30:26.010 --> 30:28.730]  Which just means, are you on your period yet?
[30:28.990 --> 30:29.450]  Yes, it does.
[30:29.910 --> 30:35.790]  I thought, let me undo send and rephrase that in a way that isn't me asking you.
[30:37.630 --> 30:40.070]  And then I fully spelled out Ragnarok.
[30:40.770 --> 30:41.150]  Wow.
[30:41.770 --> 30:42.390]  That was good.
[30:42.530 --> 30:43.290]  That was 2022.
[30:44.950 --> 30:47.850]  I don't actually think I rewrote it, I think I just didn't send it at all.
[30:48.410 --> 30:48.990]  Oh boy.
[30:50.050 --> 30:51.490]  I just, I don't even care.
[30:55.250 --> 30:55.970]  2022 moments.
[30:56.130 --> 30:58.490]  I just kicked my shoe into an iron girder in the ceiling.
[30:58.950 --> 31:02.590]  I don't think I've ever heard Barbara laugh so much in all of her life.
[31:02.790 --> 31:05.670]  That was the highlight that I just went and did because I didn't have anything on my list.
[31:06.410 --> 31:07.270]  Top Gun Maverick.
[31:07.610 --> 31:08.390]  Top Gun Maverick.
[31:08.510 --> 31:09.030]  Damn good movie.
[31:09.110 --> 31:10.690]  They were sat on that thing for a couple of years.
[31:11.470 --> 31:12.450]  They had that in the can.
[31:12.450 --> 31:13.810]  What must have that been like?
[31:13.970 --> 31:15.610]  Just having that film finished.
[31:17.870 --> 31:18.350]  Crazy.
[31:19.470 --> 31:23.210]  And finally, oh, being able to film again with Dan.
[31:23.370 --> 31:24.850]  That was an important part for me of 2022.
[31:25.290 --> 31:28.710]  I hate, I hate, I hate making my own channel without...
[31:28.710 --> 31:29.770]  Your secrecy is amazing.
[31:30.550 --> 31:35.070]  You put Dan behind Top Gun Maverick and the shoe you just kicked.
[31:36.770 --> 31:37.730]  It's true.
[31:38.930 --> 31:42.150]  Yeah, I hate making my own YouTube channel on my own, which is a problem.
[31:42.450 --> 31:43.630]  Had to do it for two years.
[31:43.970 --> 31:45.110]  It sucked.
[31:46.350 --> 31:47.450]  Glad he's back.
[31:48.470 --> 31:52.090]  So it took till 2022 for you to learn to appreciate Dan.
[31:52.730 --> 31:54.450]  Uh, no, I already, well...
[31:57.170 --> 31:58.850]  I think appreciate's a strong word.
[31:59.130 --> 32:00.990]  I was just saying, man, I would love to get there someday.
[32:01.210 --> 32:02.230]  Let's see what we can do in 2022.
[32:03.630 --> 32:05.490]  I think you'll eventually appreciate Dan too.
[32:06.270 --> 32:09.790]  And finally, England winning the World Cup.
[32:10.330 --> 32:11.090]  Hasn't happened.
[32:11.090 --> 32:12.130]  They have France?
[32:13.230 --> 32:14.470]  I feel like maybe if I say it, they'll win.
[32:14.570 --> 32:15.050]  Is that next?
[32:16.230 --> 32:18.470]  England will lose to France on the 10th of December.
[32:18.770 --> 32:21.350]  But if I say that they won, maybe it'll push it through.
[32:21.750 --> 32:22.610]  You want to make a bet?
[32:23.030 --> 32:23.990]  You want to bet 50 bucks?
[32:24.270 --> 32:25.450]  I'll bet 50 bucks they won't.
[32:25.890 --> 32:26.650]  That you won't what?
[32:26.710 --> 32:27.330]  That they won't win.
[32:27.770 --> 32:28.730]  No, why would you take that?
[32:28.850 --> 32:29.290]  I thought you were in England.
[32:29.590 --> 32:31.050]  But you just declared that they won.
[32:31.050 --> 32:34.850]  Why bet money when we have double salted black licorice?
[32:36.010 --> 32:36.670]  That's true.
[32:37.430 --> 32:38.930]  We both think England's going to lose.
[32:39.510 --> 32:41.330]  That's why we can't bet.
[32:42.770 --> 32:43.450]  That's my list.
[32:43.530 --> 32:44.070]  That's a great list.
[32:44.510 --> 32:45.490]  That's a great list.
[32:46.330 --> 32:47.250]  Top Gun Maverick.
[32:47.490 --> 32:47.850]  Great movie.
[32:49.290 --> 32:50.530]  I haven't seen it yet.
[32:50.710 --> 32:52.830]  I will watch that lunatic Scientologist make anything.
[32:52.970 --> 32:53.930]  I totally agree.
[32:54.330 --> 32:57.930]  He is the definition of suspending disbelief.
[32:59.630 --> 33:01.590]  Like, as a person, you're like...
[33:01.590 --> 33:05.470]  But then you put a gun in that guy's hand and you tell him to run in a direction and you're like...
[33:05.470 --> 33:06.710]  You son of a bitch, I'm in.
[33:06.810 --> 33:07.110]  Just doing it all.
[33:07.830 --> 33:09.450]  There's no way he does it in this movie.
[33:09.550 --> 33:12.070]  And boy, he does it near the end and you go, I can't believe they fucking did it.
[33:12.110 --> 33:12.630]  He fucking did it.
[33:12.810 --> 33:13.090]  Incredible.
[33:13.570 --> 33:14.150]  It's awesome.
[33:14.830 --> 33:17.650]  I don't think there's any other actor I'm more excited about getting old.
[33:18.670 --> 33:20.530]  He's going to have to change what movies he makes.
[33:20.770 --> 33:21.730]  I don't think he's going to.
[33:22.130 --> 33:24.530]  I think you're seeing old Tom Cruise right now.
[33:24.530 --> 33:28.070]  He already retired from Mission Impossible five movies ago and he's still back.
[33:28.230 --> 33:28.810]  He's 60.
[33:28.810 --> 33:31.010]  If he does this as a 60 year old, I'm up for it.
[33:31.110 --> 33:33.470]  I mean, Liam Neeson's out there fighting wolves and he's 95.
[33:33.730 --> 33:34.690]  That's a great point.
[33:35.190 --> 33:36.290]  He's out there fighting wolves.
[33:36.390 --> 33:37.070]  He's pissing his pants.
[33:37.170 --> 33:37.730]  He's doing it all.
[33:37.810 --> 33:39.310]  He's jumped the same fence 82 times.
[33:41.710 --> 33:42.590]  What was it?
[33:42.670 --> 33:43.390]  Like 12 cuts?
[33:45.030 --> 33:50.510]  My list is, I think a little more succinct, but big music's on there.
[33:50.770 --> 33:51.290]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[33:51.650 --> 33:52.830]  You guys know about music?
[33:52.970 --> 33:53.610]  Yeah, big fan.
[33:53.750 --> 33:53.950]  Awesome.
[33:54.030 --> 33:54.530]  I've heard of it.
[33:54.670 --> 33:58.530]  I've just realized in seven years, Tom Cruise will be years old.
[33:58.850 --> 33:59.250]  Oh!
[33:59.890 --> 34:00.170]  Oh!
[34:00.490 --> 34:01.670]  That's exactly, you're right.
[34:01.950 --> 34:04.350]  He'll be 67, so he'll be that word.
[34:04.350 --> 34:04.670]  Yep.
[34:05.730 --> 34:06.510]  That's excellent.
[34:08.710 --> 34:09.670]  That's on my list.
[34:09.670 --> 34:11.210]  I'm so thrilled that you guys can all bond over this.
[34:12.330 --> 34:14.170]  Can I amend my list to add something?
[34:14.290 --> 34:15.090]  Oh yeah, no kidding.
[34:15.330 --> 34:17.010]  I'm thankful for the word 67.
[34:17.530 --> 34:19.030]  What it truly is.
[34:20.290 --> 34:23.950]  Going off of Top Gun Maverick, the...
[34:23.950 --> 34:25.050]  I get sick every time.
[34:25.850 --> 34:29.150]  Seeing movies with my friends this year was so much fun.
[34:29.290 --> 34:32.330]  Seeing Ambulance at the beginning of the year with you and TPG.
[34:33.010 --> 34:33.850]  Incredible evening.
[34:33.850 --> 34:36.030]  Yeah, really great stuff.
[34:36.250 --> 34:41.970]  We learned about the ultimate combo, which we don't know what it is still.
[34:42.690 --> 34:43.510]  One day we'll find out.
[34:43.910 --> 34:44.530]  Really cool.
[34:46.150 --> 34:48.630]  Went and saw Top Gun Maverick with my buddy Robbie.
[34:48.950 --> 34:53.330]  We went to Baby A's and got hammered on margaritas.
[34:53.570 --> 34:58.590]  And then watched that movie in 40X and it was like we were in the plane.
[34:58.890 --> 34:59.790]  Could it have been a better movie?
[34:59.890 --> 35:01.410]  Is that like the best 40X?
[35:01.610 --> 35:02.130]  100%.
[35:02.130 --> 35:04.130]  We were tanked.
[35:04.870 --> 35:06.130]  And then drinking beer there.
[35:06.390 --> 35:07.490]  And going like, this fucking rules.
[35:07.830 --> 35:08.830]  I couldn't get enough.
[35:08.950 --> 35:10.410]  I didn't see a lot of movies in theaters.
[35:11.130 --> 35:13.110]  I don't see a lot of movies anymore.
[35:13.390 --> 35:16.770]  But seeing them with friends was a lot of fun.
[35:17.610 --> 35:21.250]  I am grateful that pro wrestling is back.
[35:21.650 --> 35:24.410]  And there are live sporting events to go to.
[35:24.830 --> 35:26.630]  Not just wrestling, but sports in general.
[35:26.950 --> 35:28.010]  Went to a Cowboys game.
[35:28.090 --> 35:29.290]  Went to a bunch of Padres games.
[35:29.290 --> 35:32.150]  Just seeing, being able to be in a crowd.
[35:32.930 --> 35:39.150]  That energy that you get from live sports is really meaningful to me.
[35:39.830 --> 35:44.050]  And on that, I'm grateful for the 2022 San Diego Padres.
[35:44.410 --> 35:46.610]  Who destroyed the Los Angeles Dodgers.
[35:47.730 --> 35:52.350]  Congratulations to the Dodgers winning 111 games and one playoff game.
[35:52.510 --> 35:53.110]  Way to go guys.
[35:53.290 --> 35:57.430]  And congratulations to Fernando Tatis for getting rid of those pesky worms.
[35:57.430 --> 36:00.470]  My team is now in 2023 worm free.
[36:00.670 --> 36:02.830]  We are worm free in 2023.
[36:03.790 --> 36:04.450]  He had like butt worms?
[36:04.610 --> 36:06.130]  No, he took steroids.
[36:07.390 --> 36:10.910]  But it was for like, oh, this is like a banned substance.
[36:10.950 --> 36:14.450]  And it's supposed to like get rid of some kind of worm or like ringworm or something.
[36:14.450 --> 36:15.410]  It was called ivermectin.
[36:15.570 --> 36:15.690]  Yeah.
[36:16.810 --> 36:17.930]  He's a horse man.
[36:18.790 --> 36:25.010]  I'm also this year grateful for, I got to take a bunch of trips that I had a good time with.
[36:25.150 --> 36:26.790]  Went to Vegas, went back home to San Diego.
[36:26.790 --> 36:28.270]  And just had a good time.
[36:28.370 --> 36:30.390]  Was able to travel and stuff.
[36:30.590 --> 36:35.610]  And then on the tail of that, had a great time with my small wife.
[36:36.030 --> 36:37.270]  And she...
[36:37.270 --> 36:39.410]  Wait, didn't you also get a small wife this year?
[36:39.510 --> 36:40.150]  No, it was last year.
[36:40.230 --> 36:40.310]  Oh.
[36:42.770 --> 36:43.770]  So it's been good.
[36:44.070 --> 36:45.150]  Retained your small wife for another year.
[36:45.150 --> 36:45.910]  I retained, yeah.
[36:46.030 --> 36:48.630]  So far, my thing I'm thankful for is retaining my small wife.
[36:50.110 --> 36:53.670]  And as much as people don't want to hear it, my job.
[36:53.790 --> 36:55.250]  I really like doing this.
[36:55.250 --> 36:57.290]  Well, you didn't look like it two hours ago.
[36:57.350 --> 36:57.910]  That's true.
[36:58.930 --> 37:01.590]  I can't believe you just said that on the same day as this.
[37:02.190 --> 37:05.070]  I really do like doing this.
[37:05.070 --> 37:12.470]  I'd rather be doing this than working in IT again, or at a zoo again, or at a Pier 1 Imports, or an electrical contractor, even a Target.
[37:13.790 --> 37:14.870]  This is great.
[37:15.010 --> 37:15.810]  It's a lot of fun.
[37:16.250 --> 37:20.170]  They pay me decent money to do something that I really like doing.
[37:20.470 --> 37:22.570]  So it's great to be able to record.
[37:22.570 --> 37:26.750]  Come up with new ideas, like Anma, which is just had a conversation.
[37:26.870 --> 37:28.690]  Someone's like, oh yeah, just rehashing the RT podcast.
[37:28.810 --> 37:33.090]  And I went, yeah, but this is a free cup of coffee that I get every week, so now it's even better.
[37:33.990 --> 37:34.610]  You dipshit.
[37:36.410 --> 37:44.050]  So grateful for all the stuff we get to do and being able to do it and the weird ideas that we can sort of piggyback on to things.
[37:44.690 --> 37:47.590]  And I'm hoping that next year we can do work with Cocaine Bear.
[37:47.750 --> 37:48.930]  I want to do something with Cocaine Bear.
[37:49.570 --> 37:50.110]  I don't even know what that is.
[37:50.110 --> 37:51.170]  Oh, that movie?
[37:51.170 --> 37:52.390]  Yeah, it's a movie about a bear that does cocaine.
[37:52.390 --> 37:53.070]  Yeah, I saw the trailer.
[37:53.170 --> 37:53.690]  It's awesome.
[37:53.950 --> 37:55.490]  It's based on a true story, apparently, too.
[37:55.730 --> 37:55.970]  Yeah, yeah.
[37:56.410 --> 37:57.430]  The bear does a bunch of cocaine.
[37:58.290 --> 37:58.870]  That's it.
[37:59.150 --> 38:00.330]  You think it's in 4DX?
[38:02.110 --> 38:03.890]  You think it makes you so fucking jittery?
[38:05.530 --> 38:07.550]  Just cocaine blowing at you in the theater.
[38:07.730 --> 38:10.110]  Oh no, I'm going to see Cocaine Bear again.
[38:12.070 --> 38:13.770]  I'm addicted to Cocaine Bear.
[38:14.930 --> 38:16.250]  But I think that's my list.
[38:16.250 --> 38:22.270]  It's just nice to be with people again, I think is my big sort of takeaway from all of it.
[38:22.790 --> 38:24.730]  Yeah, that's a great list.
[38:24.770 --> 38:26.450]  Can I make an addition to my list?
[38:26.530 --> 38:27.090]  Is it music?
[38:27.230 --> 38:27.890]  Reminded me of something.
[38:28.330 --> 38:29.070]  No, it's not music.
[38:29.470 --> 38:30.590]  It's not music, sadly.
[38:31.410 --> 38:33.670]  It's a tweet that really made me laugh.
[38:33.710 --> 38:35.990]  You were talking about sports, and I can link it to something else.
[38:36.010 --> 38:39.270]  I'm going to post it in our Slack channel for everybody to see.
[38:40.590 --> 38:44.270]  It was just the caption, what they used to describe it.
[38:44.290 --> 38:45.170]  I think it's hilarious.
[38:45.170 --> 38:46.070]  I'll read it.
[38:46.710 --> 38:51.410]  Cam Akers explodes for 37 yards in Week 12 loss.
[38:53.510 --> 38:53.990]  Explodes.
[38:54.530 --> 38:58.330]  The implication that that is what exploding is.
[38:58.490 --> 39:02.150]  Which then took me back to one of my favorite old sports clips.
[39:02.270 --> 39:03.830]  Eric, do you mind showing one more video?
[39:04.070 --> 39:05.290]  No, it's fine.
[39:05.410 --> 39:05.790]  It's not a problem.
[39:06.070 --> 39:07.170]  Let me pull it up.
[39:07.690 --> 39:12.390]  So a long time ago with the Canucks, one of my favorite sports clips of all time,
[39:12.390 --> 39:14.730]  there was a press conference with the head coach.
[39:15.350 --> 39:19.750]  And the reporter was talking to him and asking him questions about the last game.
[39:20.290 --> 39:22.170]  And he said, what did you think of your third line?
[39:22.270 --> 39:25.510]  So in hockey, the third line is not an elite player at all.
[39:25.650 --> 39:27.070]  They're good, but not great, typically.
[39:27.670 --> 39:31.190]  And he's like, how did you feel about your third line performance this week?
[39:31.530 --> 39:33.290]  Kyle Wellwood played like a man possessed.
[39:33.770 --> 39:35.030]  He had an assist.
[39:35.550 --> 39:39.710]  The notion that playing like a man possessed for Kyle Wellwood
[39:39.710 --> 39:42.670]  would be an average stat line for a good player.
[39:42.890 --> 39:45.370]  And the coach cannot contain himself at it.
[39:45.430 --> 39:46.550]  And it brings me so much joy.
[39:46.970 --> 39:47.530]  It's the Canmakers.
[39:47.730 --> 39:48.530]  I'm sending it.
[39:48.910 --> 39:50.350]  I guess I'll just put it in the same place.
[39:50.730 --> 39:52.390]  It's there for you, Eric, to pull.
[39:52.650 --> 39:53.170]  That's okay.
[39:54.150 --> 39:55.190]  What would a man possessed?
[39:55.670 --> 39:56.510]  It's like 40 seconds.
[40:03.770 --> 40:06.690]  Just the embarrassment you would feel as a player.
[40:07.690 --> 40:12.410]  Like your coach would break over saying that you did really great.
[40:12.810 --> 40:14.330]  Like that is your all-star performance.
[40:14.730 --> 40:15.630]  That same energy.
[40:15.830 --> 40:16.870]  One of my favorite clips.
[40:17.250 --> 40:18.730]  Nick, do you have anything to be thankful for?
[40:18.970 --> 40:21.550]  I'm thankful for a child that sleeps through the night.
[40:23.490 --> 40:25.470]  That's the biggest thing.
[40:25.870 --> 40:26.930]  I'm so tired still.
[40:33.410 --> 40:35.710]  It's just harder in different ways, I was going to say.
[40:37.190 --> 40:37.790]  Thank you.
[40:38.830 --> 40:40.790]  It'll just get more difficult in some other way.
[40:41.430 --> 40:42.970]  You'll transfer your exhaustion to that.
[40:43.770 --> 40:45.270]  Nick, would you consider that a hack?
[40:45.590 --> 40:47.490]  That piece of information that Geoff just gave you?
[40:47.930 --> 40:48.870]  Is that a life hack?
[40:50.130 --> 40:51.310]  I think that might be a life hack.
[40:53.170 --> 40:54.270]  It is now.
[40:55.130 --> 40:55.690]  Hey, you know what?
[40:55.770 --> 40:57.970]  I'm going to pre-put something on my 2023 list.
[40:59.350 --> 41:00.770]  When we all met up.
[41:00.950 --> 41:02.110]  Yeah, absolutely.
[41:02.590 --> 41:03.830]  That's on mine too.
[41:04.330 --> 41:05.330]  We're doing that still?
[41:05.330 --> 41:07.510]  Yeah, February in Vancouver?
[41:07.950 --> 41:09.010]  Or in Austin?
[41:09.270 --> 41:09.630]  In Austin.
[41:09.950 --> 41:10.770]  I think.
[41:11.150 --> 41:12.370]  I'm going to have to go back to Austin.
[41:12.850 --> 41:13.790]  Oh my god.
[41:14.290 --> 41:15.190]  Yeah, you are.
[41:15.890 --> 41:17.410]  You're going to have to go back to Austin.
[41:17.890 --> 41:19.010]  After all these years.
[41:20.250 --> 41:21.070]  No, last week.
[41:22.430 --> 41:23.510]  Not even a week ago.
[41:24.370 --> 41:25.410]  Well, there you have it.
[41:25.750 --> 41:26.890]  That's what we're thankful for.
[41:27.010 --> 41:27.950]  And we're thankful for you.
[41:28.050 --> 41:30.070]  Andrew already said community, but thank you guys for listening.
[41:30.950 --> 41:32.990]  It is a lot of fun when we get feedback.
[41:33.210 --> 41:34.750]  Maybe you don't have to tweet at me directly.
[41:34.750 --> 41:35.450]  Your feedback.
[41:35.950 --> 41:37.190]  But you can put it anywhere else.
[41:37.370 --> 41:37.990]  And that's probably good.
[41:38.210 --> 41:41.170]  But it is nice that people are checking this out.
[41:41.230 --> 41:43.350]  And people get so adamant and excited.
[41:43.490 --> 41:47.110]  Like, we had so much that kind of came out of nowhere.
[41:47.330 --> 41:48.690]  Like, we made a Gerpler.
[41:48.810 --> 41:50.250]  Like, we made a Switchfuck.
[41:50.530 --> 41:53.430]  We made, like, we have like these two.
[41:53.430 --> 41:56.750]  I saw them dominating the Friday sales.
[41:56.750 --> 42:02.370]  We made two shirts with Pedro Martinez and Don Simrado.
[42:03.390 --> 42:04.530]  Who's doing that in 2020?
[42:04.910 --> 42:05.650]  No one!
[42:06.530 --> 42:07.750]  Do I have one of these somewhere?
[42:08.110 --> 42:08.830]  I don't know. I can check.
[42:09.210 --> 42:09.950]  They didn't mail you?
[42:10.530 --> 42:11.810]  They should have sent it to me.
[42:11.830 --> 42:13.070]  I got like six in the mail.
[42:13.230 --> 42:14.010]  Yeah, they should have sent it to you.
[42:14.010 --> 42:15.050]  I'm gonna give them away as Christmas presents.
[42:15.270 --> 42:15.510]  That's good.
[42:16.430 --> 42:18.030]  Now I can say, hey, you.
[42:20.330 --> 42:22.510]  But yeah, I think that's it.
[42:22.750 --> 42:25.710]  Anything else that anyone else wants to take it home with?
[42:26.310 --> 42:27.330]  I'll say one last thing.
[42:28.390 --> 42:33.650]  I'll add to the good feelings and say that I also appreciate the audience this year.
[42:34.210 --> 42:36.730]  More than anything, I appreciate y'all.
[42:37.150 --> 42:41.990]  And more than all of you, I appreciate Andrew for being the inspiration for this very podcast.
[42:42.610 --> 42:42.750]  Yep.
[42:44.250 --> 42:47.710]  It was a good year for Andrew. It was a good 2022 Andrew year.
[42:47.930 --> 42:48.710]  A redemption year?
[42:49.590 --> 42:50.390]  Some of it.
[42:56.040 --> 42:58.680]  See you in 2023, losers!
[43:00.620 --> 43:00.880]  Bye.
