[00:00.000 --> 00:02.640]  These are pickled Vidalia onions. Is that...
[00:03.380 --> 00:03.700]  Wow.
[00:04.440 --> 00:06.760]  I mean, you wanted pickled onions and this is what they had?
[00:06.860 --> 00:10.100]  I went on the HEB website. I went on... I searched all over the store.
[00:10.280 --> 00:12.080]  I'd say a meat is the definition of pickled onions.
[00:12.280 --> 00:14.780]  Yeah, 100%. But that doesn't mean that it's the right thing.
[00:16.120 --> 00:17.980]  Got you a choice ham.
[00:18.200 --> 00:19.320]  Oh, and you got the English cheddar.
[00:19.320 --> 00:22.560]  And I got the English cheddar. But also, in case you wanted, you know,
[00:22.660 --> 00:25.080]  a plowman's outside of just a pizza, you could do...
[00:25.080 --> 00:27.220]  I got you, like, kind of like a crusty bread.
[00:27.400 --> 00:27.560]  Yeah.
[00:28.360 --> 00:30.440]  I always like bread with my pizza.
[00:30.620 --> 00:35.040]  Yeah, so I wasn't sure what exactly you were looking for when you said chutney.
[00:35.620 --> 00:37.240]  So I got you a sweet mango.
[00:37.680 --> 00:38.240]  Nice.
[00:38.420 --> 00:39.980]  And I got you a major gray.
[00:40.320 --> 00:45.080]  I would say that mango is the, like, the main chutney.
[00:45.200 --> 00:46.260]  That's what I thought.
[00:46.560 --> 00:47.640]  What is this?
[00:48.420 --> 00:49.000]  Pick-a-lily.
[00:49.280 --> 00:53.020]  This doesn't look like it's anyone under 40?
[00:53.360 --> 00:56.280]  No, I'm... go 60.
[00:57.960 --> 00:58.840]  This is...
[00:58.840 --> 01:00.960]  I think the pick-a-lily generation is dying out.
[01:01.580 --> 01:07.840]  This really looks like... it looks like it was invented to trick people in World War II.
[01:08.820 --> 01:12.680]  Like, we're out of food and everyone said, uh, no, this is pick-a-lily.
[01:12.920 --> 01:13.960]  Yeah, this could be food.
[01:14.060 --> 01:16.060]  Yeah, this could be the food.
[01:16.360 --> 01:17.140]  The plowman's.
[01:17.340 --> 01:17.560]  Right.
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.600]  Which also goes with the Branston.
[01:20.840 --> 01:24.440]  And then I just had a feeling last night that we were gonna run shy of Branston,
[01:24.580 --> 01:26.280]  so I went out to the store and got some.
[01:26.280 --> 01:29.680]  I was going to go to the Fiesta to go pick this up,
[01:29.780 --> 01:30.800]  and then Geoff said, I already got it.
[01:30.860 --> 01:32.080]  And I went, now I have to go to the Fiesta.
[01:33.040 --> 01:33.960]  We could all make...
[01:37.260 --> 01:39.980]  We could all make cheese and pickle sandwiches and try them.
[01:40.160 --> 01:41.940]  And you'll understand what I'm talking about.
[01:42.360 --> 01:43.200]  Oh, no, he got baguettes.
[01:43.240 --> 01:44.120]  Yeah, I got the big baguette.
[01:44.220 --> 01:45.600]  I got two different kind of pizza sauce.
[01:45.960 --> 01:47.880]  We got traditional and also...
[01:49.740 --> 01:50.060]  Stefan's.
[01:50.520 --> 01:54.080]  Now, I know you wanted to do a stuffed crust.
[01:54.360 --> 01:56.180]  We are not going to be able to roll that over.
[01:56.280 --> 01:57.380]  No, yeah.
[01:57.640 --> 01:59.380]  So we're gonna have to make crust additional.
[01:59.640 --> 02:00.440]  Make our own crust.
[02:00.920 --> 02:02.260]  So we will make our own.
[02:02.360 --> 02:03.820]  It's Pillsbury Crescent Rolls.
[02:03.960 --> 02:04.940]  So we'll unroll it.
[02:05.780 --> 02:06.960]  That's not a thing, is it?
[02:06.960 --> 02:09.580]  Make our own stuffed crust pizza.
[02:10.540 --> 02:12.740]  I've never heard of a crust extension before.
[02:12.920 --> 02:16.040]  That's... we have to do something and also to go in our crust extension.
[02:16.460 --> 02:17.880]  That's in 2022, Jesus.
[02:18.120 --> 02:21.020]  You gotta come up with new ideas or you're not gonna rise to the top.
[02:21.020 --> 02:21.380]  That's true.
[02:21.680 --> 02:25.080]  Also got the big mozzarella.
[02:25.080 --> 02:26.920]  We really want to go for it.
[02:26.920 --> 02:27.320]  Oh my god.
[02:27.320 --> 02:29.080]  It's like a Christmas stocking of cheese.
[02:29.100 --> 02:30.860]  This is a Christmas stocking of cheese.
[02:32.060 --> 02:32.780]  Your eggs.
[02:33.480 --> 02:34.560]  Oh yeah, you wanted eggs.
[02:34.820 --> 02:36.460]  And then I don't know when this is coming out.
[02:36.520 --> 02:37.540]  And I only have one.
[02:37.800 --> 02:40.400]  But somebody can celebrate with their GERPLER.
[02:40.580 --> 02:41.640]  Wow, GERPLER!
[02:42.520 --> 02:44.220]  I don't think we've ever shown this off.
[02:44.280 --> 02:45.040]  No, I don't think so.
[02:45.180 --> 02:46.040]  All right, so what's the next step?
[02:46.140 --> 02:49.460]  I've had the fire going for about an hour because the one YouTube video I did,
[02:49.540 --> 02:51.220]  I watched said it takes 4-5 minutes.
[02:51.320 --> 02:52.760]  Emily, what do you think of our ingredients?
[02:53.500 --> 02:54.580]  I think it's gonna be super gross.
[02:56.040 --> 02:58.620]  We're also making a regular pizza, so it'll be fine.
[02:58.900 --> 02:59.020]  Okay.
[02:59.240 --> 02:59.380]  Yeah.
[02:59.500 --> 03:00.640]  You want some snacking pepperoni?
[03:00.820 --> 03:01.140]  Absolutely.
[03:01.280 --> 03:01.920]  All right, that's what I thought.
[03:01.940 --> 03:03.020]  But it's turkey pepperoni.
[03:03.140 --> 03:05.460]  That's why it became the snacking pepperoni.
[03:05.520 --> 03:06.420]  Yeah, that's not regulation.
[03:07.120 --> 03:08.360]  We got regular pepperoni.
[03:08.740 --> 03:09.520]  Oh yeah, check this out.
[03:09.580 --> 03:10.400]  I was gonna use this for the fire.
[03:10.660 --> 03:11.280]  I got a new hole.
[03:11.740 --> 03:13.380]  Guess why I had to get a new shovel?
[03:13.880 --> 03:14.080]  Why?
[03:14.140 --> 03:16.000]  Because I'm digging a new bean hole for us.
[03:16.120 --> 03:16.600]  Are you really?
[03:16.660 --> 03:17.840]  And I snapped my shovel in half.
[03:18.020 --> 03:18.300]  Did you?
[03:18.420 --> 03:19.460]  Three of them, three of them.
[03:19.480 --> 03:20.500]  Three of them, three shovels.
[03:20.640 --> 03:21.700]  You're digging a new bean hole?
[03:22.040 --> 03:22.900]  Yeah, I tried to...
[03:22.900 --> 03:23.660]  I had a stump.
[03:23.660 --> 03:26.080]  I tried to blow it out with fireworks.
[03:27.180 --> 03:27.960]  What did that work?
[03:28.000 --> 03:29.460]  Wait, it was just the little sticks.
[03:30.260 --> 03:31.620]  I bought a bunch of M80s.
[03:31.760 --> 03:32.720]  It was the biggest like...
[03:32.720 --> 03:34.120]  I'm just like blowing up people.
[03:34.120 --> 03:36.160]  We drove out of town to a fireworks stand.
[03:36.240 --> 03:37.700]  I was like, give me the biggest things you got.
[03:37.800 --> 03:38.640]  He was like, here's some M80s.
[03:38.640 --> 03:40.420]  And I was like, well, it says it's a quarter stick of dynamite.
[03:40.620 --> 03:41.140]  It's not.
[03:41.640 --> 03:41.820]  Yeah.
[03:42.060 --> 03:44.100]  Do you want to take the label off so it doesn't catch on fire?
[03:44.160 --> 03:45.080]  The fire will do that.
[03:45.920 --> 03:48.460]  It's a nice sort of tornado-y day for making pieces.
[03:48.560 --> 03:50.560]  Emily keeps saying like, you know, we're supposed to go out to dinner time.
[03:50.600 --> 03:51.760]  She's like, it's gonna be bad weather tonight.
[03:51.840 --> 03:52.640]  Maybe we should just stay here.
[03:52.640 --> 03:54.600]  I'm like, eh, we'll try dinner.
[03:55.260 --> 03:55.900]  Man, that's hot.
[03:56.120 --> 03:56.820]  Yeah, it's real hot.
[03:56.900 --> 03:57.540]  Get up close to it.
[03:57.680 --> 03:58.120]  Oh, that's hot.
[03:58.120 --> 03:59.100]  Yeah, dude, but you know what?
[03:59.280 --> 04:01.400]  There's not gonna be a spider within 100 miles of this thing.
[04:01.400 --> 04:01.820]  Cooked up.
[04:02.660 --> 04:03.820]  She was fucking terrified, though.
[04:03.960 --> 04:04.220]  Ow.
[04:05.740 --> 04:06.640]  It's got my finger...
[04:06.640 --> 04:06.840]  Ow.
[04:06.980 --> 04:08.440]  Fucking hot as dicks, dude.
[04:09.620 --> 04:10.340]  God damn.
[04:11.660 --> 04:14.740]  All right, so we push it off to the side after we get it heated up.
[04:15.320 --> 04:20.000]  Supposedly what that does is it heats the center up so that it cooks on the bottom too.
[04:20.300 --> 04:20.580]  Okay.
[04:20.580 --> 04:22.680]  And then you move it to the side to make room for cooking.
[04:24.440 --> 04:26.100]  So crafting the first pizza?
[04:26.360 --> 04:26.560]  Yeah.
[04:27.160 --> 04:27.940]  Which one are we doing first?
[04:28.180 --> 04:29.900]  Oh, you have to do your Branson pickle.
[04:30.060 --> 04:30.520]  Yeah, we got it.
[04:30.520 --> 04:31.240]  This is the whole reason.
[04:31.900 --> 04:35.480]  We're gonna make the Branson pickle, Plowman's pizza, and then we'll eat the pepperoni.
[04:35.700 --> 04:36.800]  I mean, I'm excited to try that.
[04:36.960 --> 04:37.560]  I'm not.
[04:39.340 --> 04:40.980]  Everything in this is in jars.
[04:41.400 --> 04:42.240]  What is happening?
[04:44.760 --> 04:46.260]  It's like hardly food.
[04:46.300 --> 04:47.480]  Dude, England loves a jar.
[04:48.300 --> 04:50.580]  Some of this stuff won't expire until like 2024.
[04:50.960 --> 04:53.060]  Yeah, April 2024, we're good, son.
[04:53.480 --> 04:54.960]  We could be making sandwiches for years.
[04:54.960 --> 04:57.540]  Throw that in the warming closet for 10 minutes, get it nice and toasty.
[04:57.580 --> 04:58.520]  Pop it in the air and cover it.
[04:58.560 --> 05:02.120]  A recent geek guy made this knife for me and he gave it to us in Australia when we were on that tour.
[05:02.840 --> 05:03.240]  Remember that?
[05:03.240 --> 05:03.580]  That's nice.
[05:03.840 --> 05:04.480]  See like the...
[05:04.900 --> 05:05.040]  It's gorgeous.
[05:06.820 --> 05:07.540]  Okay, so...
[05:07.540 --> 05:08.620]  Hang on, hang on.
[05:09.200 --> 05:12.180]  We'll get a spoon and then you can spoon it because you're about to...
[05:13.320 --> 05:16.060]  And it's probably like less than you think you're gonna need,
[05:16.060 --> 05:17.580]  but also I want you to...
[05:22.910 --> 05:23.910]  Thanks, Geoff.
[05:24.470 --> 05:25.250]  It's fleshy, isn't it?
[05:25.350 --> 05:25.610]  Uh-huh.
[05:26.150 --> 05:27.510]  I want you to do what you feel...
[05:28.170 --> 05:29.390]  Okay, that's so much.
[05:29.470 --> 05:29.990]  That's a lot.
[05:30.470 --> 05:31.370]  That's so nice, man.
[05:31.610 --> 05:32.130]  Spread out.
[05:32.150 --> 05:32.330]  No!
[05:33.390 --> 05:33.910]  He's right.
[05:34.010 --> 05:34.750]  This is the right amount.
[05:34.850 --> 05:35.810]  This is the perfect amount.
[05:35.910 --> 05:36.250]  He's right.
[05:36.430 --> 05:37.690]  You don't want to be able to see the bottom.
[05:37.830 --> 05:38.050]  Right.
[05:38.250 --> 05:39.050]  You want a nice...
[05:39.050 --> 05:40.650]  It's also a holey dough.
[05:40.770 --> 05:41.150]  Look at it.
[05:41.590 --> 05:42.850]  So it's gonna soak in some of that stuff.
[05:43.010 --> 05:43.170]  Yeah.
[05:43.370 --> 05:44.570]  You know, that doesn't look bad.
[05:44.890 --> 05:45.510]  It doesn't look bad.
[05:45.630 --> 05:46.510]  Oh, look at that.
[05:46.630 --> 05:47.350]  Oh, wow.
[05:47.710 --> 05:48.450]  Look at that.
[05:48.450 --> 05:50.930]  How do you think English cheddar melts, Geoff?
[05:51.310 --> 05:54.950]  Uh, I don't know.
[05:55.130 --> 05:57.470]  Yeah, I would say probably not well, but...
[05:57.470 --> 05:57.910]  It's cheese, dude.
[05:58.010 --> 05:58.530]  It's cheese.
[05:58.590 --> 06:01.230]  It's just cheese from an English cow that's been eating English grass.
[06:01.570 --> 06:02.130]  It's cheese.
[06:02.350 --> 06:03.670]  Didn't they invent mad cow disease?
[06:03.970 --> 06:04.330]  Oh, shoot.
[06:04.330 --> 06:05.470]  That's only if you eat the meat.
[06:06.450 --> 06:08.270]  We'll use this bit for the crust?
[06:09.730 --> 06:10.090]  Okay.
[06:10.510 --> 06:13.250]  It is so much more sauce and so little cheese to me.
[06:13.330 --> 06:14.030]  That's a little cheese?
[06:14.290 --> 06:14.690]  Yeah, but...
[06:14.690 --> 06:15.550]  There'll be some in the...
[06:15.550 --> 06:17.290]  But I want you to do what you feel.
[06:17.290 --> 06:17.930]  Yeah, this is you.
[06:17.930 --> 06:21.310]  I'm gonna keep Branston entirely exclusive to the crust.
[06:21.450 --> 06:22.130]  I don't want...
[06:22.130 --> 06:22.990]  Oh, oh, okay.
[06:23.270 --> 06:25.250]  Because then we've got the other things for the top, haven't we?
[06:25.730 --> 06:26.350]  Oh, okay.
[06:26.530 --> 06:27.490]  I might change that later.
[06:27.630 --> 06:28.970]  Yeah, I think that might be the...
[06:28.970 --> 06:30.270]  Oh, God, look at the smell.
[06:32.490 --> 06:34.950]  I don't like anything about the way this feels.
[06:35.710 --> 06:36.410]  No, stop!
[06:36.550 --> 06:37.330]  They're all going to come apart.
[06:38.130 --> 06:38.490]  Stop!
[06:38.870 --> 06:39.230]  Stop!
[06:39.750 --> 06:40.090]  I don't know.
[06:40.170 --> 06:40.970]  Yeah, and then...
[06:40.970 --> 06:41.630]  An individual crust?
[06:41.950 --> 06:43.430]  Look, you can pull them apart.
[06:44.510 --> 06:44.870]  They're...
[06:44.870 --> 06:45.330]  Like this?
[06:45.430 --> 06:46.190]  No, you...
[06:46.190 --> 06:47.090]  Like that?
[06:47.270 --> 06:47.790]  No, look.
[06:49.030 --> 06:52.730]  The way you hold the knife scares the shit out of me.
[06:52.730 --> 06:53.670]  It's away from his hand.
[06:54.430 --> 06:55.150]  You know what?
[06:55.470 --> 06:57.690]  It's so far back on the handle.
[06:57.750 --> 06:58.590]  Have a bit of cheese.
[06:58.690 --> 06:59.450]  Using the tip.
[06:59.470 --> 07:00.710]  That cheese is so fucking good.
[07:00.910 --> 07:01.530]  You know what it tastes like?
[07:01.590 --> 07:03.750]  Have you guys ever had that Trader Joe's Impossible Cheese?
[07:04.470 --> 07:05.790]  It tastes just like that.
[07:05.850 --> 07:08.230]  It doesn't have the crystals on it, but it's a fucking awesome cheese.
[07:08.430 --> 07:09.070]  Good job.
[07:09.590 --> 07:10.870]  Why do you like your food so bad?
[07:10.930 --> 07:11.550]  This is really good.
[07:12.570 --> 07:13.710]  Okay, so we'll put the...
[07:13.710 --> 07:14.090]  Hang up.
[07:14.210 --> 07:15.250]  All the other crusts of the cheese.
[07:15.330 --> 07:16.050]  See what I'm talking about?
[07:16.050 --> 07:20.330]  So like you line the outside with your delicious English cheese and then...
[07:20.330 --> 07:21.770]  Why am I handshaking like I'm really nervous?
[07:21.770 --> 07:22.770]  I don't know. Are you okay?
[07:23.030 --> 07:23.830]  I think I'm all right.
[07:24.170 --> 07:25.570]  I just can't settle down.
[07:25.730 --> 07:26.870]  You've got something to prove, I think.
[07:26.910 --> 07:28.710]  Yeah, I'm like... I'm feeling the stress.
[07:28.810 --> 07:30.210]  Do you think it's genuine like excitement?
[07:32.490 --> 07:33.910]  You're falling apart, bud.
[07:34.310 --> 07:37.410]  Well, I think he got driven here in a U-Haul by Dan.
[07:37.590 --> 07:38.970]  He wouldn't let Dan come in.
[07:39.690 --> 07:40.690]  No, Dan's like busy.
[07:40.810 --> 07:42.790]  Dan didn't come in and he's like, no, Dan's got work to do.
[07:42.810 --> 07:44.070]  Dan doesn't want to dick around today.
[07:44.550 --> 07:45.510]  He's driving a U-Haul?
[07:45.510 --> 07:48.490]  Well, we always rent a U-Haul because it's cheaper than a car.
[07:49.670 --> 07:52.410]  I just got to ask, that's where you're pinching pennies?
[07:52.870 --> 07:54.150]  Well, we also need the space.
[07:58.590 --> 07:59.890]  Maybe this is why I'm shaking.
[08:00.290 --> 08:01.750]  Maybe it's the interrogation factor.
[08:01.850 --> 08:02.970]  Maybe it's the CO2.
[08:03.310 --> 08:06.750]  Oh yeah, are your pads breathing on you or what?
[08:06.930 --> 08:07.910]  This room feels great.
[08:08.050 --> 08:08.750]  There we go, perfect.
[08:08.990 --> 08:10.590]  Whoa, get that down there.
[08:10.910 --> 08:11.850]  Oh, thank you, thank you.
[08:12.850 --> 08:14.610]  Nick, hey, Nick, did you like it?
[08:14.670 --> 08:15.190]  I loved it.
[08:15.810 --> 08:17.030]  I'm going to start having your sandwich.
[08:17.210 --> 08:21.350]  I'm telling you, just cheese and pickle, an amazing little lunch.
[08:21.710 --> 08:22.430]  That sounds good.
[08:22.970 --> 08:23.550]  It was good.
[08:23.690 --> 08:24.270]  Here's what I'm thinking.
[08:24.750 --> 08:27.270]  It looks like you're trying to keep a demon trapped in a summoning circle.
[08:30.330 --> 08:32.430]  So are we just going to like fold it over?
[08:32.570 --> 08:34.350]  Yeah, yeah, it's kind of like that.
[08:34.570 --> 08:37.570]  And then you just got to kind of like marry it to the dough below it.
[08:37.690 --> 08:38.830]  I think that's the important part.
[08:39.070 --> 08:40.010]  I think...
[08:40.010 --> 08:40.390]  I'm excited.
[08:40.530 --> 08:42.390]  I'm really looking forward to making a pepperoni pizza later.
[08:42.390 --> 08:43.170]  But see...
[08:44.090 --> 08:46.310]  It's just not like crust material, though, is it?
[08:46.590 --> 08:46.910]  What do you mean?
[08:47.110 --> 08:48.650]  It's fucking wet bread.
[08:50.350 --> 08:51.550]  You're gonna make me throw up, stop.
[08:51.630 --> 08:52.830]  Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to say that.
[08:55.450 --> 08:55.770]  Um...
[08:55.770 --> 08:57.190]  Oh, yeah, like this end, you gotta scratch it.
[08:57.230 --> 08:58.950]  Yeah, you gotta, yeah, scratch it a little bit.
[08:59.090 --> 09:00.390]  See, that works, look at that.
[09:01.010 --> 09:02.030]  Okay, all right, good.
[09:02.370 --> 09:03.290]  So, toppings.
[09:03.710 --> 09:04.290]  Where are the eggs?
[09:05.270 --> 09:06.590]  Did we start boiling the eggs now?
[09:06.590 --> 09:07.970]  Oh, yeah, we started boiling the eggs.
[09:09.110 --> 09:11.550]  What an insane thing to ask for making a pizza.
[09:11.550 --> 09:13.130]  We're almost done with this pizza.
[09:13.690 --> 09:14.590]  Where are the eggs?
[09:15.570 --> 09:16.750]  I can't open the packet.
[09:17.430 --> 09:18.350]  I'm shaking too much.
[09:18.430 --> 09:19.390]  Why aren't you shaking?
[09:19.790 --> 09:20.750]  I think I'm hot.
[09:23.170 --> 09:23.570]  What?
[09:27.230 --> 09:28.750]  So, uh, you work on that.
[09:33.080 --> 09:33.480]  Here.
[09:33.740 --> 09:34.900]  Oh, we need to do the chutney test.
[09:35.160 --> 09:35.680]  Oh, yeah.
[09:36.460 --> 09:37.380]  What's the chutney test?
[09:37.560 --> 09:39.720]  You're gonna taste, decide on a chutney.
[09:39.840 --> 09:42.760]  I'm sorry, are you just handing me all the things that you can't open?
[09:42.760 --> 09:44.300]  That's exactly what's happening, I'm afraid.
[09:44.820 --> 09:45.440]  He's very busy.
[09:45.700 --> 09:46.560]  Oh, why is it greasy?
[09:46.860 --> 09:47.660]  What'd you do?
[09:47.820 --> 09:49.900]  I tried to open it with a ham hand.
[09:51.220 --> 09:52.580]  Okay, so I'm gonna chop.
[09:52.600 --> 09:55.060]  It's so, it's so greasy.
[09:55.840 --> 09:57.660]  Why is it, why is it?
[09:58.300 --> 09:59.120]  It's the ham.
[09:59.420 --> 10:00.700]  Uh, how many eggs do you want to go?
[10:00.820 --> 10:01.400]  Probably two.
[10:01.580 --> 10:01.820]  Okay.
[10:02.020 --> 10:02.700]  Two boiled eggs.
[10:02.960 --> 10:03.360]  All right, let's...
[10:04.240 --> 10:04.860]  Oh, I opened that one.
[10:05.140 --> 10:05.800]  Wait, no, bud.
[10:06.120 --> 10:07.520]  There's, uh, plastic all around there.
[10:07.680 --> 10:08.700]  What is, what on earth?
[10:08.860 --> 10:09.220]  What?
[10:09.600 --> 10:10.740]  They got, it's, um...
[10:10.740 --> 10:11.800]  Why does it look like banana peppers?
[10:11.860 --> 10:12.320]  What's going on?
[10:12.700 --> 10:14.160]  Onions, onion strips.
[10:14.640 --> 10:16.480]  You know how there's red parts?
[10:17.160 --> 10:17.480]  That's...
[10:17.480 --> 10:19.160]  Okay, we're just gonna do one half for that.
[10:19.520 --> 10:20.140]  Let's try this.
[10:20.240 --> 10:20.920]  Oh, what is this one again?
[10:21.140 --> 10:22.200]  This is the first one you've ever had.
[10:22.340 --> 10:23.500]  Specifically Plowman's Big Mac.
[10:23.900 --> 10:24.360]  I got excited.
[10:24.460 --> 10:27.160]  I sent them a picture while I was at the store and I said, is it this?
[10:27.580 --> 10:29.600]  Because it says the word, Plowman's word on it.
[10:29.740 --> 10:31.520]  This is more goopy, I think.
[10:31.720 --> 10:32.040]  Yeah.
[10:32.240 --> 10:33.340]  It's got like a goopier factor.
[10:33.660 --> 10:36.900]  I can't believe this is the first pizza you're making in your pizza oven.
[10:37.000 --> 10:38.760]  This is, I can't believe this is work.
[10:39.920 --> 10:43.900]  Okay, so why don't we all give an opinion on the two chummies?
[10:44.180 --> 10:44.800]  Okay, so...
[10:44.800 --> 10:45.320]  Which one is that one, Eric?
[10:45.320 --> 10:45.940]  Major Gray.
[10:46.140 --> 10:46.680]  Major Gray.
[10:46.860 --> 10:48.100]  What is Major Gray flavored?
[10:49.080 --> 10:49.900]  Like Major Gray.
[10:50.020 --> 10:51.700]  Like, what is a gray flavor?
[10:51.820 --> 10:52.120]  What?
[10:52.460 --> 10:52.860]  It's...
[10:52.860 --> 10:53.380]  Tastes like England.
[10:53.640 --> 10:53.980]  Hang on.
[10:54.360 --> 10:54.760]  It's...
[10:54.760 --> 10:55.660]  Is that Grape Coupon?
[10:55.780 --> 10:56.320]  I don't know that.
[10:56.720 --> 10:57.520]  No, I like it.
[10:57.600 --> 10:58.560]  But what is the spice?
[10:58.700 --> 10:59.040]  That's a lot to try.
[10:59.040 --> 11:00.060]  That's like sweet and sour sauce.
[11:00.160 --> 11:00.880]  That's what it is.
[11:01.720 --> 11:02.760]  That's very sweet and sour.
[11:03.120 --> 11:04.880]  Who would prefer the Major Gray?
[11:06.540 --> 11:07.340]  Now, here's...
[11:07.340 --> 11:08.660]  I think the Major Gray is better.
[11:08.760 --> 11:10.660]  It tastes the same, but Major Gray is better.
[11:10.960 --> 11:12.360]  You don't want two of the different flavors?
[11:12.480 --> 11:13.220]  You want to have onion?
[11:13.600 --> 11:14.340]  Well, that's the thing.
[11:14.420 --> 11:15.060]  I want the Branson.
[11:15.220 --> 11:16.700]  You've got the Branson in the crust, remember?
[11:17.180 --> 11:19.220]  Right, but there's a lot that's not the crust.
[11:19.640 --> 11:20.760]  There's a lot of pizza.
[11:23.460 --> 11:24.200]  That's how I feel.
[11:24.340 --> 11:25.500]  Do what you feel is best.
[11:25.620 --> 11:28.580]  If you're happy with this, Gavin, I say stick with it.
[11:28.680 --> 11:29.760]  I'm not unhappy with it.
[11:30.000 --> 11:30.720]  Oh, okay.
[11:31.660 --> 11:31.900]  Okay.
[11:35.040 --> 11:37.400]  Alexa, set a timer for 12 minutes.
[11:37.540 --> 11:38.020]  Do you like this cheese?
[11:38.020 --> 11:39.580]  I told you it's good cheese.
[11:39.700 --> 11:39.940]  It's good.
[11:40.480 --> 11:41.340]  I like a goat cheese.
[11:41.720 --> 11:44.960]  Right now, I've been eating a fennel and lavender infused goat cheese.
[11:45.160 --> 11:46.900]  That's been really nice on a sourdough.
[11:47.260 --> 11:47.620]  Yum.
[11:48.220 --> 11:49.400]  Oh, this could probably use some fennel.
[11:49.920 --> 11:51.500]  I don't think it needs anything else.
[11:52.140 --> 11:54.620]  Maybe we should just crack the raw egg onto this and get it good.
[11:54.840 --> 11:56.220]  Oh, I don't think that's a good idea.
[11:56.340 --> 11:56.480]  Okay.
[11:58.040 --> 11:58.980]  It's your pizza.
[11:59.140 --> 12:00.720]  Not even something you fought for!
[12:00.900 --> 12:02.120]  Not anything you wanted!
[12:02.960 --> 12:04.900]  Oh, look, that oven did take out...
[12:04.900 --> 12:05.920]  Oh my god!
[12:05.920 --> 12:08.120]  We'll have essences of label and glue.
[12:08.400 --> 12:09.400]  Oh, wait, wait, hang on.
[12:09.660 --> 12:11.160]  Is there action stuff all over?
[12:11.160 --> 12:12.320]  Oh, you have the pizza stone in there?
[12:12.440 --> 12:12.580]  Yeah.
[12:12.880 --> 12:13.140]  Wow!
[12:14.560 --> 12:16.000]  How are you moving the pizza stone?
[12:16.880 --> 12:17.600]  Are you not?
[12:17.760 --> 12:19.800]  I'm just gonna move it on the pizza stone with this.
[12:19.900 --> 12:20.160]  Okay, cool.
[12:20.400 --> 12:21.820]  Like they did on the internet.
[12:22.160 --> 12:24.400]  Like the one video you watched?
[12:24.440 --> 12:24.900]  Yeah, I watched one video.
[12:24.900 --> 12:26.780]  Gavin, you can get your phone way further in there.
[12:26.820 --> 12:27.420]  It's still hot.
[12:29.760 --> 12:31.420]  I think it melted my green card.
[12:32.460 --> 12:33.500]  That's fine, you don't need that.
[12:34.240 --> 12:35.680]  Take away all your cards.
[12:36.020 --> 12:37.400]  Well, now you have just one super card.
[12:37.500 --> 12:37.680]  Yeah!
[12:38.220 --> 12:40.560]  I have no idea how long we're supposed to cook it for.
[12:40.880 --> 12:42.160]  That wasn't in the video I watched.
[12:42.180 --> 12:43.920]  Well, you can definitely see how it's already burning.
[12:43.940 --> 12:46.100]  It's burning the right- the left side already.
[12:46.400 --> 12:48.660]  I think it's supposed to start to keep moving a little bit.
[12:48.820 --> 12:49.120]  Huh.
[12:51.520 --> 12:54.280]  Yeah, maybe we need to rotate it a little.
[12:54.600 --> 12:54.860]  What are you-
[12:54.860 --> 12:55.380]  With a shovel!
[12:56.700 --> 12:57.500]  Oh, a heat shield.
[12:58.060 --> 12:58.780]  Oh, okay.
[12:59.000 --> 13:00.260]  Oh god, you're just mashing it.
[13:02.680 --> 13:05.240]  Alright, I definitely think you should rotate the pizza.
[13:05.940 --> 13:08.960]  The only thing we've done so far is burn the croissant.
[13:10.260 --> 13:14.180]  Well, I don't know if the croissant was supposed to be on the pizza anyway.
[13:14.560 --> 13:16.460]  What do you mean? You were all for it!
[13:16.620 --> 13:18.380]  Yeah, but I don't- oh, it's so hot.
[13:18.480 --> 13:18.900]  Hold on a second.
[13:20.000 --> 13:21.680]  It's already burnt so much!
[13:21.680 --> 13:22.780]  It's so blackened.
[13:24.480 --> 13:26.360]  It's burning up, dude!
[13:29.390 --> 13:29.970]  Oh boy.
[13:29.970 --> 13:32.470]  It's like a roaring flame and the whole thing's burning!
[13:32.510 --> 13:33.580]  It's been in there for...
[13:36.870 --> 13:37.630]  180 seconds?
[13:40.110 --> 13:46.930]  I thought you watched one YouTube video on this.
[13:47.090 --> 13:47.690]  I did!
[13:47.770 --> 13:48.810]  He stopped it after a minute.
[13:48.870 --> 13:49.870]  He skipped a lot of it.
[13:50.530 --> 13:52.990]  He was like, yeah, 10 seconds, 10 seconds, 10 seconds, 10 seconds.
[13:53.290 --> 13:54.730]  Yeah, this all burned.
[13:56.350 --> 13:57.230]  Well, you know, except-
[13:57.230 --> 13:58.010]  It looks good!
[13:58.070 --> 13:59.010]  Except for the croissant.
[13:59.010 --> 14:01.550]  No, no, because it's burned on the crust, but it's fine.
[14:01.550 --> 14:04.310]  Yeah, look, there's an extra layer there, so we can just scrape that off.
[14:04.610 --> 14:05.890]  That was so fast, though.
[14:05.990 --> 14:07.050]  That's not done, is it?
[14:07.410 --> 14:08.550]  That's how long it takes for a pizza.
[14:08.890 --> 14:10.630]  It's not long, we're just heating it up.
[14:11.230 --> 14:13.010]  The cheese has to melt and that's it.
[14:13.470 --> 14:15.190]  Eric, I didn't think your crust idea worked.
[14:15.390 --> 14:15.850]  No, it worked.
[14:16.270 --> 14:17.390]  No, it definitely worked, look.
[14:17.470 --> 14:18.210]  It's great over here.
[14:18.410 --> 14:19.070]  Yeah, this is perfect.
[14:19.070 --> 14:22.030]  It's weird, it's like that part was touching the fire and this part wasn't.
[14:23.210 --> 14:24.070]  What are you doing?
[14:24.190 --> 14:24.710]  Is that the dough?
[14:24.810 --> 14:25.290]  No, no, this is fine.
[14:25.730 --> 14:27.670]  Oh, no, that's going to be too easy.
[14:28.070 --> 14:29.490]  This isn't made.
[14:35.030 --> 14:35.590]  That's dough.
[14:35.670 --> 14:37.470]  No, no, you just have to let it sit for a minute, you know?
[14:38.490 --> 14:39.390]  This isn't made.
[14:41.170 --> 14:42.450]  Alexa, how much time is left?
[14:47.030 --> 14:49.390]  That must have gone off while we were planning this pizza.
[14:49.470 --> 14:50.190]  That's a problem.
[14:50.250 --> 14:51.190]  Or she didn't hear you initially.
[14:51.410 --> 14:52.030]  She didn't hear me initially.
[14:52.210 --> 14:53.610]  All right, well, let's say the eggs are done.
[14:54.070 --> 14:56.190]  Now, I think the eggs probably have four or five minutes to go.
[14:56.230 --> 14:58.310]  It was 13 minutes and we weren't out there for anywhere.
[14:58.310 --> 14:59.770]  We were out there for three minutes.
[14:59.910 --> 15:00.410]  Yeah, pretty much.
[15:00.710 --> 15:02.510]  Geoff, do you want some crusts to do a stuff?
[15:02.750 --> 15:03.070]  No.
[15:03.210 --> 15:03.910]  I didn't think so.
[15:03.950 --> 15:05.210]  No, I'm just making a regular pizza.
[15:06.970 --> 15:09.110]  I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel.
[15:09.410 --> 15:09.950]  No, I appreciate it.
[15:10.250 --> 15:12.570]  This is Geoff's simple pepperoni pizza.
[15:12.810 --> 15:12.910]  Okay.
[15:13.330 --> 15:14.230]  SPP, we call it.
[15:14.610 --> 15:15.490]  Dude, look at that.
[15:15.530 --> 15:16.290]  That looks so good.
[15:16.390 --> 15:16.810]  Yeah, man.
[15:18.970 --> 15:22.070]  Look at the way it isn't turning immediately to a burnt mess.
[15:22.750 --> 15:24.350]  Oh, you can see it heat warming up, though.
[15:24.530 --> 15:25.530]  You can see it browning.
[15:25.970 --> 15:26.970]  This is not hard.
[15:26.970 --> 15:28.030]  I don't know why I was...
[15:28.590 --> 15:29.630]  How long have we lived here?
[15:29.690 --> 15:30.110]  Three years?
[15:30.510 --> 15:31.070]  Almost four.
[15:31.230 --> 15:31.690]  Four years?
[15:32.390 --> 15:33.490]  Should have tried this earlier.
[15:33.630 --> 15:34.390]  Dude, I'm telling you.
[15:34.550 --> 15:36.490]  This may have just saved this whole situation.
[15:36.630 --> 15:37.730]  That's what I was hoping for.
[15:39.390 --> 15:41.930]  Yeah, I'm just gonna try to spin it around.
[15:42.370 --> 15:43.010]  Do you want some more cheese?
[15:43.150 --> 15:43.910]  It's hot as an asshole.
[15:45.530 --> 15:46.650]  Do I have micromanaging?
[15:47.370 --> 15:48.230]  What is this, ash?
[15:48.570 --> 15:48.750]  Where?
[15:51.490 --> 15:52.110]  Oh, man.
[15:52.190 --> 15:53.810]  Looking at Geoff's and looking at mine sucks.
[15:55.470 --> 15:56.490]  Oh, smaller, maybe.
[15:56.490 --> 15:57.390]  Small one.
[15:57.610 --> 15:58.450]  Gotta prove a point.
[15:58.490 --> 15:59.350]  Oh, baby.
[15:59.470 --> 16:00.210]  I think I'll try.
[16:01.090 --> 16:01.730]  Look at that.
[16:01.890 --> 16:03.690]  Ah, look at the state of that.
[16:04.790 --> 16:05.610]  It's a real pizza, Geoff.
[16:05.630 --> 16:07.350]  SPP, simple pepperoni pizza.
[16:07.570 --> 16:09.290]  I feel slightly sabotaged, if I'm honest.
[16:09.550 --> 16:10.330]  A little bit.
[16:10.810 --> 16:11.390]  So what are you doing here?
[16:11.610 --> 16:13.930]  I'm just de-shelling my boiled egg.
[16:14.230 --> 16:14.910]  It's hot as hell.
[16:15.410 --> 16:15.770]  Ow.
[16:16.210 --> 16:17.610]  Is it supposed to be easy to take an ice bath?
[16:17.990 --> 16:19.210]  Yeah, but do you see any ice?
[16:19.390 --> 16:19.670]  I don't know.
[16:20.590 --> 16:21.590]  I'm just cracking one.
[16:22.870 --> 16:23.670]  Ah, you bastard.
[16:23.790 --> 16:23.990]  Ow.
[16:25.730 --> 16:26.930]  Oh, my God, the steam.
[16:27.110 --> 16:28.010]  I can see the steam.
[16:28.290 --> 16:28.870]  I can feel it.
[16:29.150 --> 16:29.990]  I can feel the steam.
[16:31.230 --> 16:31.490]  All right.
[16:33.070 --> 16:33.570]  Okay.
[16:34.650 --> 16:35.150]  Uh...
[16:37.710 --> 16:38.210]  Knife?
[16:38.370 --> 16:39.030]  Need my knife.
[16:42.690 --> 16:43.950]  Okay, pretty good.
[16:44.990 --> 16:45.610]  Ow, that's hot.
[16:46.350 --> 16:47.770]  That's very cooked, that egg.
[16:47.890 --> 16:49.290]  Okay, very hard-boiled.
[16:50.590 --> 16:51.590]  Holy crap.
[16:53.550 --> 16:54.290]  And then a foil.
[16:54.290 --> 16:58.210]  You said you felt sabotaged, but I think it's just because you went first.
[16:58.650 --> 16:59.850]  Uh, yeah.
[17:00.010 --> 17:01.330]  Nothing to do with the crust choice.
[17:03.570 --> 17:04.010]  Wow!
[17:04.550 --> 17:04.950]  Whoa!
[17:06.390 --> 17:06.910]  Hey, Gavin.
[17:07.430 --> 17:08.570]  Nothing to do with the crust choice.
[17:08.870 --> 17:09.490]  I'm impressed.
[17:09.930 --> 17:10.910]  I'm annoyed and impressed.
[17:11.990 --> 17:14.130]  And honestly, that's all I'm really asking for.
[17:14.850 --> 17:15.630]  Nice day for it, innit?
[17:15.830 --> 17:16.270]  This is...
[17:17.850 --> 17:18.690]  Why is it...
[17:18.690 --> 17:19.970]  It rains three days a year in Austin.
[17:20.050 --> 17:21.570]  Why is it 80 degrees?
[17:21.890 --> 17:22.590]  It's so hot.
[17:22.630 --> 17:23.710]  It's miserable.
[17:24.290 --> 17:25.650]  I'm too hot with this hot rain.
[17:25.830 --> 17:26.610]  It sucks.
[17:26.930 --> 17:27.890]  It's not even refreshing.
[17:28.030 --> 17:28.790]  It's to make me clammy.
[17:29.170 --> 17:29.690]  Oh, look!
[17:30.370 --> 17:31.410]  My boy is...
[17:32.230 --> 17:33.010]  Look at the pizza.
[17:33.870 --> 17:35.990]  Oh, he's Geoff and he's making the best pizza.
[17:36.290 --> 17:37.070]  I knew this might be done.
[17:37.130 --> 17:39.670]  You can see the steam puffing off whenever a raindrop hits it.
[17:39.690 --> 17:40.330]  This rules.
[17:41.210 --> 17:41.850]  Look at my...
[17:41.850 --> 17:42.810]  Dude, switch your hands.
[17:43.030 --> 17:43.790]  Switch your hands.
[17:50.520 --> 17:50.920]  Maybe.
[17:51.680 --> 17:53.480]  Why is he grabbing it and bunching up?
[17:54.080 --> 17:54.840]  Yeah, I was trying to...
[17:54.840 --> 17:55.580]  Ow, hot!
[17:55.900 --> 17:56.700]  Ow, hot!
[17:56.820 --> 17:57.300]  You might have touched the egg.
[17:57.300 --> 17:58.240]  Super, super hot.
[17:58.540 --> 17:59.620]  Okay, let's go see how he does.
[18:00.020 --> 18:01.560]  How long did you want to put this in for?
[18:02.740 --> 18:03.560]  30 seconds, maybe?
[18:03.720 --> 18:05.340]  How often are you going to use this now? Like, all the time?
[18:05.660 --> 18:06.620]  How often are we going to film?
[18:06.900 --> 18:09.420]  Oh, I mean, this is probably the only time we're going to film this, but...
[18:09.420 --> 18:10.300]  I don't think we have to film every...
[18:12.080 --> 18:13.300]  Oh, Nick thought this was a...
[18:13.300 --> 18:13.860]  Nick disagrees.
[18:14.340 --> 18:16.440]  Nick thought this was a regular thing we were going to start doing.
[18:16.740 --> 18:17.320]  I think that's ready.
[18:17.540 --> 18:17.740]  Yeah?
[18:17.840 --> 18:17.980]  Yeah.
[18:18.060 --> 18:20.780]  I think that's ready. Let's add our chutney and let's get tasting.
[18:21.260 --> 18:22.920]  Do we want to show this to Andrew somehow?
[18:23.520 --> 18:24.240]  I mean, we can...
[18:25.100 --> 18:27.040]  Just imagine the joy when he finally sees it.
[18:27.040 --> 18:28.720]  Okay, do you have a pizza cutter?
[18:28.720 --> 18:31.440]  Yeah, because we can't cut it or eat it without Andrew, right?
[18:31.780 --> 18:32.040]  Right.
[18:32.960 --> 18:34.160]  Oh, did you put the glove on?
[18:34.220 --> 18:35.220]  Put the fucking glove on.
[18:35.300 --> 18:35.900]  I already put it away.
[18:37.860 --> 18:38.780]  There's a spatula!
[18:39.380 --> 18:41.860]  Oh, that's a very sort of sloppy looking base.
[18:42.040 --> 18:43.680]  Like, you can really see the spatula through.
[18:44.600 --> 18:45.120]  And then...
[18:45.120 --> 18:45.900]  Oh, look at that.
[18:46.360 --> 18:50.480]  Just little bits of chutney all over to really complete the plowman's experience.
[18:50.900 --> 18:53.800]  And I think we'll just finish with a lovely bit of Piccadilly.
[18:54.840 --> 18:55.320]  Oh boy.
[18:55.320 --> 18:56.800]  Oh my...
[18:56.800 --> 18:58.300]  Oh, it's so chunky.
[18:58.740 --> 19:00.600]  The chunky Piccadilly on one side.
[19:00.860 --> 19:03.460]  Chunky Piccadilly sounds like a dance from the 60s.
[19:04.860 --> 19:06.300]  Okay, I think that's done.
[19:06.940 --> 19:09.080]  And will you be over on this backside filming them?
[19:09.200 --> 19:09.760]  Because that's what we need.
[19:10.040 --> 19:11.720]  Hey man, we made our pizzas. How are you doing?
[19:12.800 --> 19:13.340]  I'm good.
[19:13.600 --> 19:17.880]  Let's give it a minute because we'll have to start rolling here.
[19:18.080 --> 19:20.500]  Are you ready to start rolling if we need it to, Andrew?
[19:20.500 --> 19:23.120]  Uh, I need like 30 seconds.
[19:23.880 --> 19:25.820]  Hang on. Geoff's house is talking to us.
[19:25.940 --> 19:26.760]  Alexa, shut up.
[19:27.680 --> 19:29.220]  She'll do that, but not the timer.
[19:29.940 --> 19:30.540]  Yeah, okay, good.
[19:31.700 --> 19:32.480]  Well, here we are.
[19:34.920 --> 19:35.640]  Office day.
[19:36.260 --> 19:37.460]  Is this the intro?
[19:37.860 --> 19:42.460]  Eric said that this is the only time we'll ever use the pizza oven and that that's it.
[19:42.620 --> 19:45.360]  But I say, and Nick agreed very quickly,
[19:45.540 --> 19:49.660]  this will be a semi-regular thing and we'll keep coming up with recipes and improving.
[19:49.660 --> 19:51.700]  It all goes into the cookbook.
[19:52.080 --> 19:55.680]  Hi, welcome to the supplementary episode of F*** Face.
[19:55.760 --> 19:57.560]  We've gotten together at Geoff's house to cook these pizzas.
[19:57.740 --> 19:59.220]  It's how you set the scene.
[19:59.320 --> 20:01.400]  But this is like 20 minutes into the pizza video, isn't it?
[20:01.580 --> 20:02.500]  Is this a separate thing?
[20:02.940 --> 20:06.060]  Are we not releasing audio of this?
[20:06.860 --> 20:08.040]  As an audio podcast?
[20:10.320 --> 20:11.840]  Are you for real?
[20:12.160 --> 20:13.860]  This is why he produces.
[20:14.360 --> 20:16.100]  It's an audio podcast!
[20:18.280 --> 20:20.660]  There are people who just want this!
[20:22.020 --> 20:23.260]  Yeah, no, you're right.
[20:23.360 --> 20:23.880]  That's a good point.
[20:23.880 --> 20:24.180]  You nailed it.
[20:24.440 --> 20:28.780]  Well, in that case, let me just say, we just filmed episode, what, 128 yesterday?
[20:28.900 --> 20:29.100]  Yeah.
[20:29.360 --> 20:32.160]  And then to this today, Eric has been on point with the intro.
[20:32.320 --> 20:34.600]  I nominate Eric for season five intro guy.
[20:34.700 --> 20:35.380]  This is right.
[20:35.440 --> 20:38.960]  It's so easy to set the scene and then you go.
[20:39.100 --> 20:40.600]  I don't...
[20:40.600 --> 20:46.020]  Welcome to F*** Face supplementary pizza podcast number one, office day number two.
[20:46.020 --> 20:47.200]  Not quite sausage talk.
