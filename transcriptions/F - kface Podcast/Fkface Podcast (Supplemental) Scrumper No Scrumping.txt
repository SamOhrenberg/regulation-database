[00:00.000 --> 00:01.940]  Is there a special word for stealing eggs?
[00:02.460 --> 00:02.700]  Hmm.
[00:03.320 --> 00:09.520]  Like, you know, like, some items, it's just called theft, but like, if you steal an apple, it's scrumping.
[00:10.020 --> 00:14.480]  I didn't know that. No, I didn't. I didn't know apple had its own thing.
[00:14.880 --> 00:16.740]  Oh, you never went scrumping as a child?
[00:17.060 --> 00:18.440]  What the fuck is that?
[00:18.800 --> 00:19.140]  What is scrumping?
[00:19.660 --> 00:21.080]  Oh, is that just a British thing?
[00:21.580 --> 00:23.920]  What is... you mean just like picking apples?
[00:24.480 --> 00:25.940]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
[00:25.940 --> 00:31.240]  Well, I haven't looked up scrumping. I'm pretty sure it just means you've, like, nicked someone else's apples off their tree.
[00:31.520 --> 00:36.040]  So, in America, we have, like, you'll go buy private property, you'll see signs posted that say, like,
[00:36.060 --> 00:38.900]  posted, no trespassing, violators will be shot, stuff like that.
[00:39.260 --> 00:46.760]  Do you see... do you see, in England, are there signs on trees that say, like, no scrumping, scrumpers will be prosecuted?
[00:47.520 --> 00:48.500]  Scrumpers will be shot?
[00:49.200 --> 00:50.380]  Scrumpers will be shot on sight?
[00:51.020 --> 00:54.580]  I bet I've... I think there has been a no scrumping sign at some point.
[00:55.420 --> 01:01.540]  I feel like that would be such a stressful thing if you're like, okay, we got these people, we're putting... you're in this field, okay?
[01:02.080 --> 01:04.860]  No scrumping allowed. If you scrump, you're out of the game.
[01:05.040 --> 01:10.360]  And just seeing what people, like, have to process what scrumping even means, I'd never guess it would be picking apples.
[01:10.820 --> 01:13.220]  I love it without the ing. Like, to scrump.
[01:16.540 --> 01:18.540]  You see that tree? He scrumped it.
[01:26.900 --> 01:29.960]  Bad fuckin' scrumper with his bag of apples.
[01:32.900 --> 01:34.480]  You see all those pies?
[01:36.420 --> 01:38.680]  Those pies are the product of scrumping?
[01:40.180 --> 01:46.800]  Got, like, black markets scrumped pies. I love the idea of a conversation in prison like this.
[01:47.020 --> 01:47.860]  What are you in for?
[01:47.860 --> 01:50.980]  My bad about scrumping.
[01:51.300 --> 01:52.680]  Grand scrumping.
[01:54.360 --> 01:58.280]  Instead of, like, teardrops for kills, it's apples for theft for scrumps.
[01:58.940 --> 02:04.100]  I'm just imagining somebody getting pulled over with a giant sack of apples in their backseat sweating.
[02:10.140 --> 02:16.300]  You know when, like, a cop is searching something and they see something of criminal activity and they just grab their gun?
[02:16.300 --> 02:18.740]  And somebody's just seeing the big cray of apples?
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.060]  He, like, looks at you and goes, you're going pretty fast there, ma'am. Everything okay?
[02:26.200 --> 02:30.260]  And you're like, yeah, sorry, I didn't realize I was speeding. He sees the bag of apples in the back and he just touches it and goes, ma'am.
[02:30.640 --> 02:32.400]  Statsback goes, ma'am, I need you to get out of the car right now.
[02:32.400 --> 02:33.260]  Get out of the car right now.
[02:33.300 --> 02:34.460]  Hands on the car! Hands on the car!
[02:36.280 --> 02:38.520]  Whoa. You wanna see where that clip's from?

[02:53.360 --> 02:53.720]  I'm not scrumping.
