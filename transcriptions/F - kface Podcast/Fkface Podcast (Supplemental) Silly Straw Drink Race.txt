[00:00.000 --> 00:02.400]  Hey, what's up? It's Geoff from F*** Face.
[00:02.940 --> 00:03.600]  And this is Gavin.
[00:03.720 --> 00:03.920]  Hi.
[00:04.060 --> 00:04.940]  He also is from F*** Face.
[00:05.320 --> 00:08.520]  And we've been, we've decided that we have the straws.
[00:08.820 --> 00:09.400]  Ooh, deep.
[00:09.400 --> 00:11.060]  It says F*** Face, that's who we are.
[00:11.900 --> 00:15.240]  And we're gonna, we're gonna race each other, Gavin.
[00:15.720 --> 00:17.860]  78% of my daily sugar.
[00:20.280 --> 00:20.880]  Sugar free?
[00:21.080 --> 00:21.260]  Yeah.
[00:21.420 --> 00:21.740]  There you go.
[00:22.320 --> 00:23.380]  When was the last soda you drank?
[00:24.280 --> 00:25.360]  The one we drank in the GoPro.
[00:26.700 --> 00:28.580]  You guys drink soda stream all the time.
[00:28.580 --> 00:29.740]  I do, he doesn't.
[00:30.080 --> 00:31.840]  Yeah, well I have a fizzy water, does that count as soda?
[00:31.840 --> 00:32.480]  He has fizzy water.
[00:32.500 --> 00:33.620]  He doesn't, he doesn't.
[00:33.760 --> 00:34.840]  Yeah, I don't put...
[00:37.500 --> 00:38.480]  Don't worry about that.
[00:41.380 --> 00:43.620]  I feel like when, everyone's falling apart.
[00:43.660 --> 00:43.800]  Yeah.
[00:44.940 --> 00:46.640]  It's a rocky area up in here.
[00:47.060 --> 00:48.340]  It's filled up, should be pretty good.
[00:48.400 --> 00:49.620]  Alright, crack your soda open.
[00:50.120 --> 00:50.780]  And insert.
[00:51.800 --> 00:52.060]  Alright.
[00:52.940 --> 00:53.820]  Got our helmets for safety.
[00:54.220 --> 00:54.420]  Yeah.
[00:55.600 --> 00:57.680]  Well forget that, let's go for a...
[00:58.580 --> 00:58.940]  Yeah.
[00:59.100 --> 01:00.000]  Alright, here we go.
[01:00.100 --> 01:01.160]  Ready, insert your straw.
[01:01.600 --> 01:03.500]  And then whoever finishes the soda first, right?
[01:03.620 --> 01:03.840]  Yes, yep.
[01:03.920 --> 01:04.100]  Alright.
[01:04.460 --> 01:05.000]  Okay, ready.
[01:06.200 --> 01:06.920]  On your mark.
[01:07.420 --> 01:08.000]  Get set.
[01:08.380 --> 01:08.640]  Go!
[01:09.920 --> 01:13.980]  Okay, now Gracie, how do you feel about how much soda is probably coming through this
[01:13.980 --> 01:14.440]  thing right now?
[01:14.700 --> 01:16.920]  It looks like nothing based on Gavin's face.
[01:17.740 --> 01:19.240]  Although Geoff seems to be pretty nauseous.
[01:19.420 --> 01:19.800]  He's sipping.
[01:19.800 --> 01:21.560]  He's snapping his straw pretty hard.
[01:21.960 --> 01:22.300]  Uh huh.
[01:22.320 --> 01:22.600]  At the start.
[01:22.920 --> 01:23.860]  Yeah, no, he's got it.
[01:24.080 --> 01:25.280]  Maybe wiggle the start a little.
[01:25.420 --> 01:26.880]  Oh wow, how's your soda tasting, Geoff?
[01:27.140 --> 01:28.060]  It's so good.
[01:28.060 --> 01:28.800]  Oh, is it refreshing?
[01:28.900 --> 01:30.060]  It's even better through the fuck face straw.
[01:30.180 --> 01:30.400]  Oh wow.
[01:30.980 --> 01:31.600]  How's yours?
[01:32.000 --> 01:32.900]  Are you trying to get another...
[01:32.900 --> 01:33.640]  What are you doing?!
[01:33.640 --> 01:34.080]  The straw!
[01:34.460 --> 01:34.980]  You're wasting time!
[01:35.000 --> 01:35.760]  That one sucked!
[01:35.880 --> 01:37.180]  He's wasting straws.
[01:38.860 --> 01:39.940]  Come on, Geoff, you got this.
[01:40.120 --> 01:41.260]  Oh, it's so good.
[01:41.520 --> 01:42.480]  Come on, Geoff, you got it.
[01:44.080 --> 01:45.080]  Maybe he's not getting anything.
[01:45.280 --> 01:46.300]  I don't even care if I win.
[01:46.380 --> 01:47.780]  I feel like I'm winning just by doing it.
[01:47.880 --> 01:48.020]  Right.
[01:48.020 --> 01:48.420]  By being here.
[01:48.620 --> 01:48.860]  Right.
[01:49.020 --> 01:49.740]  Any luck there?
[01:49.920 --> 01:50.560]  Yeah, how's it going?
[01:50.940 --> 01:51.680]  This one's worse.
[01:52.920 --> 01:53.980]  How could it be worse?
[01:54.320 --> 01:55.760]  Should we have rinsed the inside of the straw?
[01:55.920 --> 01:56.220]  Nah.
[01:56.680 --> 01:58.020]  I'm sure the factory did that.
[01:59.380 --> 02:00.120]  Geoff's got it.
[02:00.180 --> 02:00.700]  Look at this.
[02:02.080 --> 02:02.480]  Powerful.
[02:03.500 --> 02:04.360]  Oh wow, dude.
[02:04.440 --> 02:06.040]  All that soda is almost gone.
[02:08.240 --> 02:09.140]  You can hear it?
[02:09.240 --> 02:09.600]  It's going?
[02:11.720 --> 02:12.780]  Now you just have to suck.
[02:13.360 --> 02:14.780]  This is the worst.
[02:16.020 --> 02:17.100]  Look at these kinks.
[02:17.580 --> 02:18.360]  That's completely impractical.
[02:18.860 --> 02:20.580]  Yeah, but look, there's soda coming out the end.
[02:20.680 --> 02:21.780]  We shouldn't sell this.
[02:22.500 --> 02:23.220]  It's so good.
[02:24.000 --> 02:24.700]  Here's what it does.
[02:24.700 --> 02:27.980]  It's like I have a puppy, and if you...
[02:27.980 --> 02:28.660]  Little dog puppy, right?
[02:28.860 --> 02:30.520]  He's 85% mouth.
[02:30.840 --> 02:35.700]  He'll just inhale food all at once and he'll throw it up because he can't eat it all at once.
[02:35.740 --> 02:39.460]  So you have to feed it to him slowly with a little device that feeds it slowly.
[02:39.700 --> 02:42.200]  This is for people that are a little too into soda.
[02:42.360 --> 02:42.840]  It's true.
[02:43.220 --> 02:46.140]  Nick is also just doing it.
[02:47.660 --> 02:48.880]  Go for it, Gracie.
[02:49.060 --> 02:49.240]  Here.
[02:50.880 --> 02:51.440]  Go for it.
[02:51.480 --> 02:52.240]  How is everyone doing it?
[02:52.620 --> 02:54.200]  Well, I think they're just sucking on the straw, dude.
[02:54.780 --> 02:57.280]  I have the sucking power of a normal adult human.
[02:58.680 --> 03:00.120]  You got it. You're getting soda, right?
[03:05.540 --> 03:06.280]  Gracie's got a tip.
[03:06.780 --> 03:08.440]  It's somehow mostly carbonation.
[03:08.740 --> 03:10.380]  I'm just sucking all the CO2 out.
[03:11.840 --> 03:13.100]  Geoff seems lightheaded.
[03:13.460 --> 03:16.280]  I've been sucking this for a minute straight. Look how far in I've made it.
[03:16.280 --> 03:17.900]  Oh, that's quite a bit.
[03:18.460 --> 03:18.860]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:19.000 --> 03:20.960]  The taste of the plastic coming through the air.
[03:21.180 --> 03:22.780]  I know, it's extra, right? It makes it better.
[03:24.700 --> 03:25.980]  Wow, where can you get one of these?
[03:26.020 --> 03:26.600]  It makes me nauseous.
[03:26.660 --> 03:28.820]  Everyone was worried about microplastics, but it's the next one.
[03:28.820 --> 03:29.100]  Where?
[03:29.480 --> 03:30.720]  Store.roosterteeth.com
[03:30.720 --> 03:31.180]  Wow.
[03:31.620 --> 03:34.300]  This is macroplastics. It's way bigger.
[03:34.900 --> 03:36.460]  This is way fucking bigger, dude.
[03:39.140 --> 03:40.080]  Geoff's got it.
[03:41.120 --> 03:41.980]  Suck it down, bud.
[03:42.000 --> 03:42.820]  Where is the main kink?
[03:43.020 --> 03:43.300]  Uh-huh.
[03:43.820 --> 03:44.620]  How's it going, Gracie?
[03:45.320 --> 03:46.040]  Christ alive.
[03:46.220 --> 03:47.820]  Oh, man, it really wears your mouth out.
[03:47.960 --> 03:48.620]  Oh, God.
[03:50.100 --> 03:51.960]  I can't even blow a bubble if I blow.
[03:52.180 --> 03:52.940]  No, you blow. I can't.
[03:52.940 --> 03:56.520]  It's like a hamster drinking out of one of those bottles.
[03:56.940 --> 03:58.940]  Right, but a hamster does that and survives.
[03:59.100 --> 04:00.000]  I think you guys would all die.
[04:01.740 --> 04:02.480]  Geoff's doing it.
[04:02.600 --> 04:03.240]  I think I'm halfway.
[04:03.660 --> 04:03.940]  Yeah.
[04:04.500 --> 04:04.820]  Halfway.
[04:05.180 --> 04:06.100]  Let's see if you can test it.
[04:06.480 --> 04:07.540]  Okay, let's try it with water.
[04:07.880 --> 04:08.140]  Okay.
[04:09.180 --> 04:10.520]  This is as fast as I can suck.
[04:10.520 --> 04:10.880]  All right, here we go.
[04:11.480 --> 04:14.840]  Now we get a visual representation of what really happens.
[04:14.960 --> 04:15.120]  Are you ready?
[04:15.280 --> 04:15.600]  Yep.
[04:18.400 --> 04:18.720]  Suck.
[04:19.320 --> 04:20.580]  I see it. It's going down.
[04:21.380 --> 04:22.060]  Look at it.
[04:22.840 --> 04:23.860]  There you go.
[04:24.140 --> 04:25.220]  Look at this.
[04:25.720 --> 04:27.220]  Wow, it's disappearing.
[04:27.560 --> 04:29.500]  He's got a lot to learn about sucking.
[04:29.820 --> 04:31.460]  Look at this.
[04:36.720 --> 04:37.440]  Suck harder.
[04:38.820 --> 04:39.640]  Still going.
[04:39.940 --> 04:41.420]  Has that started to grace you refreshing?
[04:41.880 --> 04:42.220]  No.
[04:42.580 --> 04:42.920]  What?
[04:43.200 --> 04:44.980]  I'm at like a millimeter a minute, I think.
[04:45.020 --> 04:45.620]  Yeah, you're doing good.
[04:45.980 --> 04:46.560]  How about you, bud?
[04:47.700 --> 04:48.920]  You got your helmet on for safety.
[04:49.240 --> 04:50.200]  You're doing great.
[04:50.200 --> 04:53.460]  And I'm enjoying slowly drinking my soda.
[04:53.580 --> 04:54.820]  I'm going to try an alternate method.
[04:54.960 --> 04:55.100]  Okay.
[04:55.800 --> 04:56.120]  Oh!
[04:56.620 --> 04:58.020]  All right, now that's interesting.
[04:58.600 --> 05:02.420]  I don't know if it changes literally anything, but, you know...
[05:02.420 --> 05:04.820]  What if I flip it the other way, like this?
[05:05.720 --> 05:07.280]  Oh, you're doing kind of like a straight up and down.
[05:07.740 --> 05:08.320]  It did nothing.
[05:08.760 --> 05:11.020]  Right, I don't know why you think it would, but that's pretty cool.
[05:11.280 --> 05:12.280]  What if I unkink it?
[05:12.420 --> 05:13.720]  I was going to say, can it be unraveled?
[05:14.620 --> 05:15.120]  A straw?
[05:15.120 --> 05:16.680]  What if I just turn it into a spoon?
[05:17.720 --> 05:19.400]  What did you think was going to happen?
[05:19.400 --> 05:20.420]  All right, now use it.
[05:22.360 --> 05:23.160]  Now's the time.
[05:23.440 --> 05:24.180]  Now's the time.
[05:24.580 --> 05:25.160]  Suck, Gavin.
[05:25.460 --> 05:26.320]  Oh, maybe try the other one.
[05:26.420 --> 05:27.200]  The problem might be in that.
[05:27.440 --> 05:28.700]  Well, I really fucked mine.
[05:29.880 --> 05:30.620]  There's a hole in it.
[05:30.640 --> 05:31.340]  I can't get anything out.
[05:31.340 --> 05:32.720]  Can you guys not break the fucking straws?
[05:32.720 --> 05:33.080]  Yeah, right?
[05:33.840 --> 05:34.480]  Jesus Christ.
[05:34.720 --> 05:38.820]  You guys must be so strong, because these are industrial-grade straws.
[05:39.060 --> 05:41.320]  Like, a normal human shouldn't be able to snap one like that.
[05:41.340 --> 05:44.520]  Now, I will say, if you do break your straw, you're kind of a moron.
[05:44.780 --> 05:45.940]  Because it's not that hard.
[05:46.160 --> 05:47.000]  How is there so much liquid in this?
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.080]  Well, it's because there's so much liquid going...
[05:49.900 --> 05:50.440]  Hang on.
[05:50.780 --> 05:52.320]  Here we go, and...
[05:52.320 --> 05:53.080]  There we go, round.
[05:53.620 --> 05:54.500]  I'm in the can.
[05:56.360 --> 05:57.300]  Right into you.
[05:57.860 --> 05:58.240]  Fine.
[05:59.980 --> 06:00.980]  Oh, this is great.
[06:01.220 --> 06:01.400]  Yeah?
[06:01.600 --> 06:02.440]  This is phenomenal.
[06:03.520 --> 06:04.660]  Yeah, you broke it.
[06:07.900 --> 06:09.620]  I've never worked so hard in my life.
[06:09.780 --> 06:10.260]  Yeah, I gave up.
[06:10.800 --> 06:11.600]  Oh, wow.
[06:12.480 --> 06:13.060]  Thanks for moving.
[06:14.540 --> 06:14.900]  Ugh.
[06:16.400 --> 06:17.460]  How you doing over here?
[06:17.660 --> 06:18.560]  How does this can feel?
[06:18.680 --> 06:22.420]  We should have sold Fablip straws, because they are absolutely phenomenal.
[06:23.380 --> 06:25.300]  How the fuck did you get that?
[06:25.560 --> 06:26.900]  Oh, he just started breaking it?
[06:27.140 --> 06:29.760]  I mean, they're super strong hands, because a normal human shouldn't be able to do that.
[06:29.760 --> 06:31.540]  My mighty bicep defaced it.
[06:33.020 --> 06:34.880]  Alright, this is about as far as I can get, I think.
[06:36.040 --> 06:36.740]  How much of that is left?
[06:37.060 --> 06:37.680]  Oh, shit.
[06:38.880 --> 06:39.240]  Wow!
[06:39.420 --> 06:39.960]  What do you think?
[06:40.300 --> 06:43.040]  Oh, dude, there's maybe a third.
[06:43.820 --> 06:45.160]  Fuck, I can get there.
[06:45.300 --> 06:45.960]  You're going to do it?
[06:46.040 --> 06:46.600]  I'm going to try.
[06:46.760 --> 06:48.220]  Wow, Gavin gave up.
[06:48.240 --> 06:50.040]  I'm going to promote this to the straw that you give your friends.
[06:50.560 --> 06:51.640]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[06:52.080 --> 06:58.080]  So what you do is you buy a few of them, and you give them to your friends to drink sodas through,
[06:58.160 --> 07:00.780]  and then you film a video, and you don't have to drink through the straw.
[07:01.640 --> 07:05.120]  You've thought this through, and you don't have to be the one drinking through the straw.
[07:05.140 --> 07:07.940]  And if you want your friend to hang out for ages, this is the straw for you.
[07:08.600 --> 07:10.880]  Oh, yeah, dude, just one more drink, and then you can go.
[07:10.880 --> 07:12.820]  Anyway, check out this straw I got you.
[07:13.120 --> 07:13.920]  Don't drink it while driving.
[07:14.060 --> 07:14.680]  How's it going over here?
[07:16.920 --> 07:20.400]  I was thinking maybe this would have been easier if we would have named it the slurper, but it's the same letters, I think.
[07:20.940 --> 07:23.500]  Oh, he was counting. He was on his fingers, counting.
[07:23.980 --> 07:24.660]  That's pretty cool.
[07:24.860 --> 07:26.040]  A lot of loops in that, too.
[07:26.980 --> 07:27.180]  Yeah.
[07:28.040 --> 07:28.880]  I'm feeling good, man.
[07:30.260 --> 07:33.140]  I need a mouth nap.
[07:35.840 --> 07:37.340]  Oh, this is 23 flavors?
[07:37.720 --> 07:37.940]  Yeah.
[07:38.060 --> 07:38.720]  How many are in this?
[07:39.040 --> 07:39.820]  I think just one.
[07:39.820 --> 07:40.460]  Just one flavor?
[07:40.540 --> 07:41.760]  Yeah, I think there's just one flavor in that.
[07:41.840 --> 07:42.600]  That's way better value.
[07:42.700 --> 07:43.460]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[07:44.200 --> 07:45.040]  Higher calorie, though.
[07:46.100 --> 07:46.700]  It's true.
[07:46.940 --> 07:48.000]  Well, that's one of the flavors.
[07:48.380 --> 07:52.160]  It's like the fuckin' Americanized version of that shit Linda used to make us drink.
[07:53.660 --> 07:54.600]  What's that stuff called?
[07:54.740 --> 07:55.060]  Unicum?
[07:55.760 --> 07:56.020]  Yeah.
[07:56.820 --> 07:58.260]  Oh, my God, I forgot the taste of that.
[07:59.620 --> 08:00.800]  I quit drinking because of that.
[08:02.400 --> 08:02.720]  Whoa.
[08:04.140 --> 08:05.600]  It's like a little bottle of heartburn.
[08:05.600 --> 08:07.700]  Mmm, mmm.
[08:09.020 --> 08:10.080]  How'd it get liquid on me?
[08:11.000 --> 08:12.660]  So, what do you think of the...
[08:13.100 --> 08:14.460]  I'm so close to being the champion.
[08:14.460 --> 08:15.980]  You're almost there. You gotta do it.
[08:16.280 --> 08:17.300]  And then you're the champion?
[08:18.040 --> 08:18.400]  Wow.
[08:18.860 --> 08:19.960]  Take that, Gavin.
[08:21.120 --> 08:22.540]  Well, you know, my face fell off.
[08:23.140 --> 08:24.040]  You did that.
[08:24.160 --> 08:24.980]  You took your face off.
[08:25.000 --> 08:25.500]  I tried to unfurl it.
[08:25.520 --> 08:26.500]  It should be easier now.
[08:27.340 --> 08:28.520]  You have less loops to go through.
[08:28.700 --> 08:29.180]  On this?
[08:29.420 --> 08:30.820]  No, now that you've broken it off.
[08:31.100 --> 08:32.160]  That's what I've been sucking through.
[08:32.980 --> 08:34.340]  Well, eat it and you still have time.
[08:34.420 --> 08:34.540]  Oh.
[08:35.820 --> 08:37.140]  It won't beat him.
[08:38.520 --> 08:39.760]  So, you got your safety helmet on.
[08:40.000 --> 08:40.360]  He just gave up.
[08:40.620 --> 08:41.080]  He got it.
[08:42.420 --> 08:43.420]  He did just give up.
[08:43.520 --> 08:44.840]  But that was before the rest of it.
[08:45.620 --> 08:46.120]  How you doing, man?
[08:46.860 --> 08:47.320]  Pretty good.
[08:47.880 --> 08:49.180]  Geoff's pedal to the metal right now.
[08:49.260 --> 08:49.740]  This is pretty good.
[08:50.460 --> 08:53.700]  I'm very impressed that he has kept his straw intact and he's this far along.
[08:53.780 --> 08:55.240]  I mean, he's a regular human being.
[08:55.260 --> 08:55.760]  Well, it's a quality straw.
[08:55.960 --> 08:56.940]  It's not hard to keep it intact.
[08:57.080 --> 08:57.580]  No, it's not.
[08:57.620 --> 08:58.700]  Geoff doesn't not be an asshole.
[08:58.840 --> 08:58.940]  Yeah.
[09:03.500 --> 09:04.820]  I've never been a good salesman.
[09:04.820 --> 09:05.120]  Yeah.
[09:07.960 --> 09:08.880]  How you doing?
[09:09.340 --> 09:13.580]  Well, I think the tagline for this should be, I'm here for a long time, not a good time.
[09:15.740 --> 09:17.100]  Nick also got a great salesman.
[09:17.240 --> 09:17.400]  Uh-huh.
[09:17.500 --> 09:17.920]  Oh, whoops.
[09:18.820 --> 09:19.800]  Sorry, I reversed that.
[09:20.700 --> 09:20.940]  Oh, yeah.
[09:21.160 --> 09:22.740]  Suck it out so it's clean, so it's clear.
[09:23.040 --> 09:24.000]  There's a shitload still in there.
[09:24.020 --> 09:24.480]  Don't grace me full.
[09:24.660 --> 09:25.240]  Don't grace me full.
[09:29.580 --> 09:30.280]  Let's race.
[09:30.500 --> 09:30.980]  I can't.
[09:31.060 --> 09:31.840]  You hold this cake.
[09:32.160 --> 09:33.320]  I can't race you.
[09:33.320 --> 09:34.500]  Hold this cake, Gracie.
[09:37.360 --> 09:38.100]  There's a cake.
[09:38.160 --> 09:38.820]  What the fuck?
[09:39.620 --> 09:40.900]  Did you do it?
[09:41.780 --> 09:42.600]  We have a winner.
[09:43.140 --> 09:43.660]  That's empty.
[09:44.700 --> 09:45.520]  Geoff is the champion.
[09:48.400 --> 09:51.680]  Very, that is advanced strawing.
[09:51.900 --> 09:52.080]  Yeah.
[09:52.400 --> 09:52.900]  Advanced slurping.
[09:53.280 --> 09:56.840]  But if you've already passed basic slurp, you should be fine.
[09:57.100 --> 09:57.260]  Yeah.
[09:59.700 --> 10:01.240]  I sucked myself a headache.
[10:01.560 --> 10:02.340]  I don't feel good as shit.
[10:02.340 --> 10:03.180]  Oh, yeah?
[10:03.620 --> 10:05.960]  Well, that's why you have your safety helmets on, in case you pass out.
[10:06.020 --> 10:08.920]  It's like equal, you're drinking equal parts air and water.
[10:09.040 --> 10:09.200]  Yeah.
[10:09.520 --> 10:10.360]  Well, it's carbonation.
[10:10.920 --> 10:12.280]  How the fuck did you do that?
[10:13.740 --> 10:16.960]  She's getting, she's getting mad in the corner on a one wheel.
[10:19.180 --> 10:20.260]  Yeah, so there you go.
[10:23.500 --> 10:26.900]  Gracie got bored with what you guys were doing, and she's gonna do one wheel stuff now.
[10:27.060 --> 10:27.900]  I'm gonna go chase Michael.
[10:28.160 --> 10:30.700]  You can go 18 miles an hour, I think, on that one.
[10:30.700 --> 10:34.060]  Gracie's like, eh, it's just a really good face jam day for me.
[10:37.500 --> 10:40.400]  Watch your head and other parts.
[10:40.480 --> 10:41.180]  You gotta get one of these helmets.
[10:41.200 --> 10:41.580]  Oh, get rid of the helmet.
[10:41.840 --> 10:42.080]  Oh, yeah.
[10:43.020 --> 10:43.500]  Safety helmet.
[10:43.820 --> 10:45.460]  All right, final thoughts?
[10:48.220 --> 10:49.780]  Dude, I gotta be honest with you.
[10:50.460 --> 10:52.860]  I've slurped a lot of straws in my life.
[10:53.780 --> 10:58.080]  Never have I had an experience quite like drinking an entire soda through a f*** face straw.
[10:58.220 --> 10:58.420]  Okay.
[10:58.420 --> 11:04.840]  It's, uh, it's one of those things I could try to put it in words, but I don't know that words can really capture that magic.
[11:06.260 --> 11:08.560]  I think you're just gonna have to try for yourself, honestly.
[11:08.760 --> 11:09.900]  The whites of my eyes turn red?
[11:10.200 --> 11:11.400]  Yeah, they're like a different color now.
[11:11.580 --> 11:13.360]  Do you think I have the world record?
[11:14.800 --> 11:18.200]  If you can beat Geoff, send us the video.
[11:18.660 --> 11:19.120]  That's true.
[11:19.320 --> 11:20.140]  Yep. Okay.
[11:21.580 --> 11:22.620]  Uh, straw transition.
[11:22.820 --> 11:23.340]  F*** face out.
[11:23.980 --> 11:25.140]  Gracie, lift your left arm up.
[11:26.980 --> 11:27.660]  Oh, Christ.
[11:28.420 --> 11:29.200]  Oh!
