[00:09.730 --> 00:10.110]  Zero.
[00:10.390 --> 00:11.370]  Dun-dun-dun-dun!
[00:11.430 --> 00:11.670]  Oh!
[00:11.810 --> 00:12.710]  Dun-dun-dun-dun!
[00:12.710 --> 00:13.130]  Dun-dun-dun-dun!
[00:13.130 --> 00:13.810]  Dun-dun-dun-dun!
[00:13.830 --> 00:15.350]  Dun-dun-dun-dun!
[00:16.190 --> 00:23.470]  Hello, hello, hello, hello, and welcome to another episode of Sloppy Joe's Bingo Live!
[00:23.490 --> 00:23.970]  Yeah!
[00:24.490 --> 00:25.510]  Coming at ya!
[00:25.650 --> 00:29.950]  If you're watching this, if you're listening to this, then you're seeing Key West, Florida,
[00:30.210 --> 00:33.310]  Duval Street, right outside of Sloppy Joe's.
[00:33.610 --> 00:34.630]  A mainstay.
[00:34.630 --> 00:43.590]  ...a historical artifact of a great past, and I don't know what I'm saying, but it's been a long day, dude.
[00:43.630 --> 00:44.950]  It's been a long fucking day.
[00:45.550 --> 00:46.690]  It's been a long week.
[00:47.430 --> 00:51.670]  I was trucking last night until about 3 AM. I'm fucking tired.
[00:52.250 --> 00:54.270]  It's been a whole thing.
[00:54.490 --> 00:57.950]  What we're gonna do is, over the next hour, we're gonna play Slappy Jazz Bingo with you.
[00:58.390 --> 01:02.410]  If you are not familiar with Slappy Jazz Bingo, you can play along with us.
[01:02.410 --> 01:05.990]  I believe there is a website you can go to and generate your own bingo card.
[01:06.270 --> 01:12.230]  If you don't want to do that, in about 10 minutes, we're gonna be selling the Slappy Joe Bingo kit live on the Rooster Teeth website.
[01:12.670 --> 01:16.930]  If you buy it, and maybe if you pick express shipping, you can get it before the end of the livestream.
[01:17.130 --> 01:19.050]  But it's probably not, because it's Friday night.
[01:19.330 --> 01:20.090]  No, I don't think you can.
[01:20.550 --> 01:24.070]  You're safest bet is probably to go the website route if you want to play along with us.
[01:24.690 --> 01:28.190]  You're happy just to watch. Maybe you would enjoy just watching along with us, too.
[01:28.650 --> 01:31.010]  That might be enjoyable. But it's always fun to play along.
[01:31.010 --> 01:33.790]  I think the winner of Slappy Jazz Bingo always gets a cake.
[01:34.430 --> 01:37.230]  Although I don't think anybody's ever received a cake or asked for it.
[01:37.390 --> 01:40.030]  I mean, I won, and I was supposed to get a cake, and I didn't buy myself a cake.
[01:40.110 --> 01:43.170]  So that can still stand. It's just that I didn't buy myself a cake.
[01:43.570 --> 01:48.030]  I think you need to be in charge of buying your own cake if you win, it sounds like.
[01:48.490 --> 01:49.710]  We'll just expense it to Eric.
[01:50.150 --> 01:50.390]  Great.
[01:50.970 --> 01:53.970]  Yeah, so this works exactly like bingo works.
[01:53.970 --> 02:01.930]  We're going to look for certain things, like dudes wearing cowboy hats, or people wearing blue jeans and flip-flops, or a police car.
[02:02.390 --> 02:07.190]  And you yell bingo, or you call it out, and then whoever gets bingo first wins a cake.
[02:07.610 --> 02:13.190]  If it goes fast before the hour's up, then we'll probably just try to black out the bingo board like we always do.
[02:14.050 --> 02:15.570]  And yeah, am I missing anything?
[02:16.450 --> 02:19.090]  No, I don't think so. I'm just excited for the stuff going on.
[02:19.090 --> 02:28.250]  So the stuff that's going on sale in about 7 minutes at store.roosterteeth.com will be the Sloppy Drew's bingo set.
[02:28.410 --> 02:36.950]  That will include a lot of really cool stuff, like a shirt that says Sloppy Drew's Canada on it.
[02:38.930 --> 02:43.050]  Three daubers for your bingo cards, red, yellow, and blue.
[02:43.270 --> 02:47.510]  And then official Sloppy Bingo cards that have all been randomized.
[02:48.010 --> 02:54.090]  We will actually be playing off of some official Sloppy Bingo cards tonight, which I'm very excited about.
[02:54.350 --> 02:55.930]  Can I say something about that real fast?
[02:56.170 --> 02:56.470]  Sure.
[02:56.810 --> 03:01.830]  My fiancee begged me to make a point of mentioning that they're not dry erase boards.
[03:01.970 --> 03:06.710]  I guess she thought you'd be able to wipe them clean after using them, but if you mark on it, it's marked.
[03:08.130 --> 03:12.570]  She was like, you've got to let them know. You've got to let the audience know it's not wipeable.
[03:12.850 --> 03:15.470]  And so I just wanted to be clear, this is paper.
[03:15.470 --> 03:18.230]  Well, maybe round two they get wipeable.
[03:19.490 --> 03:22.130]  Maybe. I don't know if we have that technology, Gavin.
[03:22.970 --> 03:24.310]  That sounds innovative.
[03:26.330 --> 03:33.410]  Also on sale tonight will be the Geoff's Fridge fridge magnet that will not stick to Geoff's fridge.
[03:33.890 --> 03:34.130]  Right.
[03:34.450 --> 03:37.130]  You can check that out. That's also there.
[03:37.130 --> 03:44.330]  And then also, something I'm actually using right now, the Vancouver Child Kicker desk mat.
[03:44.530 --> 03:46.250]  I don't even know what you call it. Mouse mat?
[03:46.450 --> 03:53.290]  It is huge. It is probably the length of two keyboards.
[03:54.130 --> 03:57.290]  Is it the same as my prototype one that I've been using for like nine months?
[03:57.450 --> 03:58.950]  It's about the same size, yes.
[03:59.550 --> 04:01.690]  It's amazing. I've still got it in place.
[04:01.690 --> 04:10.010]  It's really good. I'm a firm believer in oversized desk mats, and this is my preferred giant desk mat now.
[04:10.270 --> 04:12.630]  So I really, really, really recommend it.
[04:12.850 --> 04:14.510]  Is the desk mat wipeable?
[04:15.350 --> 04:16.150]  Hang on, let me see.
[04:17.430 --> 04:21.110]  Wiping it right now, yes. We do have desk mat wiping technology.
[04:21.390 --> 04:21.470]  Oh, wow.
[04:21.710 --> 04:28.850]  So if there's a way that we can print Sloppy Joe's bingo cards on a giant desk mat, then we might be in business.
[04:29.410 --> 04:30.450]  That's the way to go.
[04:30.450 --> 04:32.950]  The lottery, like your numbers never change.
[04:33.830 --> 04:37.990]  You're just stuck with the same bingo the whole time. I love it.
[04:38.370 --> 04:42.910]  But it's more than like, it's a bunch of different cards in the bingo set.
[04:43.050 --> 04:45.790]  So you randomize, you go for it, you go insane mode.
[04:46.250 --> 04:52.890]  And they're, by the way, they're big sheets, and you get three different colored daubers, so you can easily reuse them.
[04:52.890 --> 04:57.210]  Think like when you get Yahtzee in the mail, and you gotta write, or in the mail.
[04:57.310 --> 05:01.450]  You buy a game of Yahtzee at the store, and then it comes with a paper that you use over and over again.
[05:02.350 --> 05:02.750]  Yeah.
[05:02.750 --> 05:04.190]  I'm real fucking stupid tonight.
[05:04.870 --> 05:05.570]  Yahtzee in the mail?
[05:06.910 --> 05:09.030]  Is anybody else a fucking idiot tonight?
[05:09.110 --> 05:10.790]  Are you in Gavin's office?
[05:11.250 --> 05:13.150]  Are you breathing in cat air?
[05:13.650 --> 05:20.510]  Dude, it's just been a crazy week, and this is the very end of the week, and we're ending it on very high energy production.
[05:20.510 --> 05:21.130]  We are.
[05:21.450 --> 05:22.690]  I've been sick all day, too.
[05:23.230 --> 05:25.390]  Yeah, because you ate cheese.
[05:25.930 --> 05:27.550]  Well, I ate bad cheese.
[05:28.090 --> 05:29.610]  I ate expired ricotta cheese.
[05:30.410 --> 05:32.110]  It was good at the time, sort of.
[05:32.190 --> 05:33.430]  I thought it was a little too sweet.
[05:33.750 --> 05:36.130]  What? Too sweet?
[05:36.610 --> 05:36.810]  Yeah.
[05:37.670 --> 05:39.890]  He's built up a cheese tolerance. He probably thought he could handle it.
[05:40.150 --> 05:41.430]  Yeah, that guy almost got hit by a car.
[05:41.450 --> 05:43.450]  Yeah, he did. He really almost got hit by a car.
[05:44.250 --> 05:47.430]  And if you were playing Sloppy Joe's Bingo right now, that could be one of your prompts.
[05:47.430 --> 05:48.230]  It's on the board.
[05:48.730 --> 05:50.910]  The description will have a link to Goovicon.
[05:51.490 --> 05:51.910]  Goovicon.
[05:53.710 --> 05:54.210]  Grrkyz.
[05:55.650 --> 06:00.530]  Grrkyz's website where you can get a sloppy bingo card randomly generated.
[06:01.070 --> 06:02.490]  So go play Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[06:02.570 --> 06:07.370]  We're going to get started here in about seven minutes when it actually hits slop o'clock.
[06:07.470 --> 06:08.590]  Because that's when it's going to get sloppy.
[06:08.910 --> 06:13.390]  There's a woman being attacked by a strobe light in the top right that I don't know if you keep seeing.
[06:13.750 --> 06:15.350]  But that's really...
[06:15.350 --> 06:19.690]  I think she was taking a selfie with a flash or something.
[06:19.970 --> 06:21.110]  Oh, it's her own strobe light?
[06:21.210 --> 06:22.590]  Even though it's well lit out there.
[06:22.750 --> 06:25.550]  She was blinding herself that whole time.
[06:26.030 --> 06:27.090]  Geoff, you've been here.
[06:27.550 --> 06:29.550]  Yes, I have. Thanks for asking.
[06:30.990 --> 06:31.650]  Didn't... okay.
[06:32.290 --> 06:39.390]  What would you say it's like right now? Because it is getting to slop o'clock.
[06:39.650 --> 06:41.830]  I'm going to tell you, Eric, it's fucking exciting right now.
[06:41.910 --> 06:43.510]  It's a little wild. It's a little crazy.
[06:43.510 --> 06:44.810]  It's pretty loud.
[06:44.990 --> 06:46.910]  It already smells like stale beer.
[06:47.690 --> 06:49.110]  Everybody's having a blast.
[06:49.510 --> 06:51.890]  We're looking down on them at like a three-quarter angle.
[06:52.390 --> 07:01.490]  And somehow, we've discovered there's a phenomenon that when you look down on people like this, they appear far more sober than they are at eye level.
[07:01.710 --> 07:06.010]  I guarantee you right now, if you walked by any of these people and they...
[07:06.010 --> 07:07.090]  They would have glassy eyes.
[07:07.350 --> 07:07.710]  Really?
[07:08.770 --> 07:11.470]  They would be barely holding themselves up high.
[07:11.470 --> 07:16.050]  Everybody you see is at least 30% drunker than they look from this angle.
[07:16.150 --> 07:17.310]  There's going to be a lot of cars.
[07:17.690 --> 07:19.570]  There's going to be bicycles going the wrong way.
[07:19.630 --> 07:21.450]  There's going to be aggressive honking everywhere.
[07:21.970 --> 07:23.950]  It's an orgy of fun.
[07:24.610 --> 07:25.550]  And, uh...
[07:26.290 --> 07:27.710]  Yeah, you know, just people having a good time.
[07:28.550 --> 07:30.590]  You know when you get your orgies in the store?
[07:30.910 --> 07:31.610]  You get them in the mail?
[07:32.110 --> 07:32.430]  Yeah.
[07:34.390 --> 07:35.390]  It's the same thing.
[07:35.990 --> 07:38.230]  Y'all gotta stop expecting me to talk to that.
[07:38.250 --> 07:38.730]  I don't have it.
[07:40.070 --> 07:42.170]  You're like the host of this thing.
[07:42.170 --> 07:44.570]  I think it's clear that I don't have it tonight.
[07:46.450 --> 07:48.630]  Is it, like, too late for you?
[07:49.010 --> 07:49.750]  No, it's just...
[07:49.750 --> 07:50.210]  It's the...
[07:50.210 --> 07:51.310]  I just think it's honestly...
[07:51.310 --> 07:58.130]  I think it's the cumulative effect of a very, very long, high-energy, exciting but stressful week.
[07:59.410 --> 08:00.110]  It has been a lot.
[08:00.210 --> 08:04.290]  We've recorded a piece of fuckface content every day outside of Monday.
[08:04.690 --> 08:05.210]  Oh, that's true.
[08:05.770 --> 08:06.210]  Very true.
[08:06.970 --> 08:07.470]  Is that true?
[08:08.210 --> 08:08.530]  Yeah.
[08:08.610 --> 08:08.710]  Yeah.
[08:08.710 --> 08:10.230]  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and tonight?
[08:10.610 --> 08:12.350]  Yeah, we've been doing a lot.
[08:12.950 --> 08:17.050]  The thing that we announced is that we'll be taking over the Let's Play channel.
[08:17.490 --> 08:17.950]  Oh, shit!
[08:19.510 --> 08:20.690]  Did you just learn that, Gavin?
[08:20.930 --> 08:21.290]  What?
[08:21.630 --> 08:22.990]  Wait for it to tell Gavin!
[08:24.470 --> 08:26.470]  This is why you gotta come to the meetings, man.
[08:26.670 --> 08:27.830]  Starting next Friday.
[08:28.930 --> 08:30.030]  Starting next Friday,
[08:30.530 --> 08:32.030]  the 6th of October,
[08:32.630 --> 08:34.650]  on Let's Play, we will have
[08:34.650 --> 08:36.730]  a new video every Friday
[08:36.730 --> 08:38.470]  on YouTube, on the Let's Play channel.
[08:38.930 --> 08:40.470]  And then starting on Monday,
[08:40.790 --> 08:42.610]  the 9th, not this coming Monday,
[08:42.770 --> 08:43.910]  you're gonna hear this, and you're gonna go,
[08:43.990 --> 08:45.470]  you said Monday, not this Monday,
[08:45.910 --> 08:48.370]  Monday the 9th, fuckfaceoff...
[08:48.370 --> 08:50.450]  Wait, hang on, Nick, you have to get ready. Ready for the button?
[08:50.910 --> 08:51.630]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:51.670 --> 08:54.010]  3, 2, 1...
[08:55.210 --> 08:57.010]  Faceoff will be live
[08:57.010 --> 08:58.790]  on the Rooster Teeth
[08:58.790 --> 09:00.390]  website for First members.
[09:00.890 --> 09:01.870]  So, ready, Nick?
[09:01.970 --> 09:03.470]  3, 2, 1...
[09:04.750 --> 09:05.170]  Faceoff
[09:05.170 --> 09:07.590]  is a show where we have
[09:07.590 --> 09:09.330]  computer simulated
[09:10.790 --> 09:11.210]  baseball
[09:11.210 --> 09:13.530]  in this case, where we are the front
[09:13.530 --> 09:15.410]  office, the games
[09:15.410 --> 09:17.510]  play themselves, so we are not even
[09:17.510 --> 09:19.230]  managing teams, we've just put together
[09:19.230 --> 09:21.510]  our own teams, and we have a big
[09:21.510 --> 09:23.070]  bet on the line that
[09:23.070 --> 09:25.250]  you have to sign up for first and check it out
[09:25.250 --> 09:27.450]  on the 9th to see what the bet
[09:27.450 --> 09:29.390]  is and see exactly what we're doing on
[09:29.390 --> 09:31.370]  the, I'm not gonna wait for Nick again, beep
[09:31.370 --> 09:31.970]  Faceoff.
[09:32.070 --> 09:34.930]  I was ready that time.
[09:35.430 --> 09:37.310]  We have recorded almost the whole season
[09:37.310 --> 09:38.250]  and it is
[09:40.230 --> 09:41.270]  so good.
[09:41.490 --> 09:42.930]  I think you guys would all agree, it is
[09:42.930 --> 09:44.410]  so good.
[09:44.830 --> 09:47.150]  We've recorded 5 episodes and
[09:47.150 --> 09:48.910]  4 of them are so
[09:48.910 --> 09:49.630]  good.
[09:54.050 --> 09:56.550]  It's all on sale right now!
[09:57.090 --> 09:59.350]  We're not gonna tell you which one, but one of them
[09:59.350 --> 10:00.990]  maybe not so good.
[10:01.090 --> 10:03.450]  Don't worry.
[10:04.390 --> 10:05.710]  You'll hear it in us.
[10:06.190 --> 10:07.590]  Store.roosterteeth.com
[10:07.590 --> 10:08.990]  Everything's on sale. The
[10:08.990 --> 10:11.030]  bingo box, the VCK
[10:11.030 --> 10:13.330]  desk mat, and Geoff's fridge fridge magnet
[10:13.330 --> 10:14.310]  all on sale.
[10:14.830 --> 10:16.830]  Wanna give a shout out to
[10:17.350 --> 10:18.930]  Natalie on the store team
[10:18.930 --> 10:20.990]  who started her day
[10:20.990 --> 10:23.530]  in Austin putting the vinyl reissue
[10:23.530 --> 10:25.470]  on sale and is ending her day
[10:25.470 --> 10:27.330]  in Arkansas putting
[10:27.330 --> 10:28.850]  all of these on sale at
[10:28.850 --> 10:29.250]  10pm.
[10:30.650 --> 10:32.410]  Weird day for Natalie.
[10:32.430 --> 10:35.190]  Why did we make Natalie go all the way to Arkansas
[10:35.190 --> 10:35.710]  to do that?
[10:36.410 --> 10:38.630]  We said that's where the switch is.
[10:39.170 --> 10:40.250]  Factory problem.
[10:41.570 --> 10:43.190]  Pranking the newbie again.
[10:43.250 --> 10:45.010]  It was a factory problem.
[10:46.150 --> 10:47.550]  I'm hearing rumors
[10:47.550 --> 10:49.390]  that the magnet is also
[10:49.390 --> 10:49.890]  wipeable.
[10:50.030 --> 10:53.190]  The magnet is
[10:53.190 --> 10:53.670]  wipeable.
[10:53.670 --> 10:55.490]  on the scene.
[10:56.690 --> 10:57.870]  My actual fridge
[10:57.870 --> 10:58.730]  is not wipeable.
[10:59.730 --> 11:01.910]  It will not stick to Geoff's fridge
[11:01.910 --> 11:03.190]  so he'll never know.
[11:03.490 --> 11:05.610]  It is stuck to my fridge and it's open right now.
[11:05.850 --> 11:07.230]  It's nice. I'm very happy.
[11:08.770 --> 11:09.790]  Geoff's fridge is open
[11:09.790 --> 11:10.390]  on my fridge.
[11:10.710 --> 11:13.930]  Do you not bang the side of your face
[11:13.930 --> 11:14.670]  on it when you walk by?
[11:21.380 --> 11:22.720]  Have you ever banged
[11:22.720 --> 11:24.340]  the side of your face on a fridge, Gavin?
[11:24.340 --> 11:24.960]  Ever?
[11:25.340 --> 11:26.660]  If the doors are stuck open.
[11:31.870 --> 11:33.610]  Oh man, I'm glad I'm not the only one
[11:33.610 --> 11:34.750]  that's fucking lost.
[11:37.210 --> 11:38.650]  Hey, is Smee around?
[11:39.550 --> 11:40.690]  He's under my desk.
[11:41.110 --> 11:42.790]  Can you tell Smee I say hi?
[11:44.030 --> 11:44.550]  Hey Smee!
[11:45.530 --> 11:46.510]  Oh, he didn't even look.
[11:46.870 --> 11:47.890]  He doesn't give a shit.
[11:48.970 --> 11:51.030]  He was full-blown Schmee mode earlier
[11:51.030 --> 11:52.090]  but he's really chill at the moment.
[11:52.090 --> 11:53.710]  Really? That's so cool.
[11:54.390 --> 11:56.130]  We have an episode of
[11:56.130 --> 11:57.270]  Anima that's coming out
[11:57.990 --> 11:59.830]  this coming week, on Monday.
[12:00.870 --> 12:02.050]  I mean, we'll just
[12:02.050 --> 12:03.390]  talk about it briefly.
[12:03.930 --> 12:05.570]  Gavin is a special guest on Anima.
[12:06.130 --> 12:08.350]  He didn't know he was going to be a special guest on Anima.
[12:09.010 --> 12:10.330]  But he was.
[12:10.850 --> 12:12.210]  And I told Geoff
[12:12.210 --> 12:13.890]  and Gus on the way
[12:13.890 --> 12:15.050]  that Smee respects me.
[12:18.090 --> 12:20.050]  I feel like I've seen
[12:20.050 --> 12:22.130]  evidence of a tentative
[12:22.130 --> 12:23.130]  respect.
[12:23.450 --> 12:26.210]  I've seen Eric hear about
[12:26.210 --> 12:28.230]  Smee, get brave with Smee
[12:28.230 --> 12:30.030]  and then get a little bit more
[12:30.030 --> 12:31.910]  scared of Smee, even though nothing has
[12:31.910 --> 12:32.490]  happened yet.
[12:34.070 --> 12:35.810]  There's, again, a healthy respect.
[12:35.910 --> 12:38.270]  A mutual respect between me and
[12:38.270 --> 12:40.010]  Gavin's cat. And we will
[12:40.010 --> 12:42.130]  say that when the cat goes crazy and bites
[12:42.130 --> 12:44.290]  you very, very hard, we call it going Schmee mode.
[12:44.690 --> 12:44.910]  So,
[12:45.550 --> 12:47.470]  I'm feeling pretty good about Smee.
[12:47.470 --> 12:49.390]  Would you say animals
[12:49.390 --> 12:51.490]  in general respect you, Eric? Or is this
[12:51.490 --> 12:53.410]  a special respect between you and Smee?
[12:53.730 --> 12:55.710]  I think after working for a zoo,
[12:56.150 --> 12:58.390]  I learned that you can build
[12:58.390 --> 12:59.530]  up a healthy respect
[12:59.530 --> 13:01.530]  with animals. I had a goat that respected
[13:01.530 --> 13:03.770]  me. I had a horse that I was friends with.
[13:05.010 --> 13:06.050]  The guanacos?
[13:06.270 --> 13:07.170]  Not friendly.
[13:07.530 --> 13:08.530]  So I didn't even try.
[13:09.050 --> 13:11.410]  Yeah, guanacos are like llamas. Didn't even
[13:11.410 --> 13:11.830]  try.
[13:13.990 --> 13:15.030]  Guinea hens?
[13:15.930 --> 13:17.030]  Friendly. Made friends
[13:17.030 --> 13:19.210]  with them. A giant Flemish rabbit?
[13:19.510 --> 13:20.670]  Wouldn't come over and say hi.
[13:20.970 --> 13:22.290]  But again, healthy respect.
[13:23.950 --> 13:25.250]  Respect for animals,
[13:25.450 --> 13:26.370]  I get it.
[13:28.190 --> 13:28.670]  Guanacos?
[13:28.990 --> 13:30.810]  Yeah. I'm imagining just like llamas
[13:30.810 --> 13:33.170]  in leather jackets. Like they're the pumice snakes.
[13:33.450 --> 13:35.030]  That's my mental imagery.
[13:35.030 --> 13:36.230]  Hey, what's up, butterfly? Hey!
[13:36.330 --> 13:37.330]  What up, guanacos?
[13:38.430 --> 13:40.170]  Just a llama holding a comb.
[13:42.150 --> 13:42.710]  Oh, man.
[13:42.710 --> 13:44.250]  Hey, Geoff. Yeah, what's up, buddy?
[13:44.350 --> 13:45.650]  It is slop o'clock.
[13:47.630 --> 13:49.090]  Now bingo begins!
[13:49.310 --> 13:49.710]  Bingo begins.
[13:50.070 --> 13:51.370]  Oh, there's a manager right there.
[13:52.750 --> 13:53.610]  That's the manager?
[13:54.250 --> 13:56.850]  Yeah, that's him. Oh, I've got hug and chug
[13:56.850 --> 13:58.130]  on the same line. That's great.
[13:59.170 --> 13:59.850]  That's nice.
[14:00.490 --> 14:01.670]  What do I got going on here?
[14:02.570 --> 14:04.590]  Alright, assholes, do something.
[14:04.690 --> 14:05.210]  It's Friday night.
[14:05.950 --> 14:08.030]  Looking for someone to hoof in it.
[14:08.450 --> 14:10.510]  Be prepared for the next 45 minutes of me yelling
[14:10.510 --> 14:10.930]  trip.
[14:11.250 --> 14:13.670]  He got a wheelchair again.
[14:14.490 --> 14:15.870]  I've never seen one.
[14:16.130 --> 14:18.410]  I got a wheelchair too.
[14:18.670 --> 14:20.210]  That's a dance.
[14:20.630 --> 14:21.250]  He twirled up.
[14:22.850 --> 14:23.870]  Dancing in the street.
[14:24.610 --> 14:24.970]  Dancing.
[14:25.750 --> 14:27.930]  Oh, that wasn't a dance. He was directing traffic.
[14:28.130 --> 14:30.510]  That was not a dance. It was temporarily that blocker lemming.
[14:33.430 --> 14:33.910]  What?
[14:34.790 --> 14:36.310]  You know, you make the lemming block
[14:36.310 --> 14:37.970]  all the other lemmings and they have to go the other way.
[14:38.530 --> 14:40.190]  They all want to die, don't they?
[14:41.170 --> 14:41.430]  Is that
[14:41.970 --> 14:42.550]  the manager?
[14:43.290 --> 14:44.530]  Yeah, he's checking out his foot.
[14:44.770 --> 14:47.630]  He's playing along.
[14:48.030 --> 14:48.790]  That was a nose pick.
[14:50.130 --> 14:50.670]  Do I have that?
[14:52.790 --> 14:54.190]  I don't have it.
[14:54.410 --> 14:56.330]  I hate puking. It's so rare.
[15:00.090 --> 15:02.010]  I need a mullet. I need jeans
[15:02.010 --> 15:02.850]  and flip flops.
[15:03.730 --> 15:05.770]  We saw a mullet before this all started.
[15:05.770 --> 15:08.530]  Why would Emily text you right now?
[15:08.830 --> 15:09.770]  To let me know that
[15:09.770 --> 15:11.630]  she wants me to let everybody know that merch
[15:11.630 --> 15:14.110]  doesn't show up on the fuckface page on the store.
[15:14.250 --> 15:15.110]  It's only as new.
[15:15.390 --> 15:17.990]  Thank you. Store.roosterteeth.com
[15:17.990 --> 15:18.390]  Go there now.
[15:18.390 --> 15:19.110]  Is that a cowboy hat?
[15:20.810 --> 15:21.930]  Definitely a cowboy hat.
[15:23.430 --> 15:24.810]  Do I have a cowboy hat?
[15:25.150 --> 15:26.110]  I don't.
[15:27.150 --> 15:27.890]  Oh, I do!
[15:29.350 --> 15:30.870]  Selfie, dead parrot head, and skateboard.
[15:31.370 --> 15:32.330]  I need mullet.
[15:32.790 --> 15:34.350]  Have you seen less dead
[15:34.350 --> 15:36.190]  parrot heads since the loss
[15:36.190 --> 15:37.210]  of Jimmy Buffett?
[15:38.930 --> 15:40.550]  Or more, out of respect.
[15:42.030 --> 15:42.510]  You know,
[15:42.550 --> 15:44.230]  I haven't been playing much, so I'm not sure.
[15:44.310 --> 15:46.310]  I did watch The Weekend He Died, and I saw
[15:46.310 --> 15:48.110]  the little parade they had for him and stuff.
[15:48.790 --> 15:50.130]  Oh, that guy's holding something. Drop it!
[15:52.090 --> 15:54.290]  Grab that beer from that lady and chug
[15:54.290 --> 15:55.890]  both of them. Double fisting and a chug.
[15:56.010 --> 15:56.890]  There's a cowboy hat.
[15:58.810 --> 15:59.870]  Is this a chug?
[15:59.870 --> 16:00.570]  Is that for girls, too?
[16:01.010 --> 16:01.830]  Some of us is.
[16:02.190 --> 16:06.290]  That's just a healthy drink.
[16:06.830 --> 16:08.510]  Just a healthy drink.
[16:08.770 --> 16:10.150]  I need somebody to suck on a chili dog.
[16:10.750 --> 16:11.770]  Now we're talking.
[16:12.270 --> 16:14.410]  Or maybe on some American flag clothes.
[16:14.650 --> 16:16.270]  I could use some American flag clothes.
[16:16.310 --> 16:18.130]  Another fucking cowboy hat?
[16:19.390 --> 16:20.230]  They're everywhere.
[16:22.770 --> 16:24.710]  One guy on guy's scooter.
[16:25.130 --> 16:26.150]  Give me the scooter, baby.
[16:26.150 --> 16:27.810]  Gotta love guy on guy's scooter.
[16:27.910 --> 16:28.930]  That's one of my favorite.
[16:29.210 --> 16:31.850]  You know, Emily and I have been playing
[16:31.850 --> 16:33.790]  a modified version at home where we've added
[16:33.790 --> 16:35.090]  about ten new ones in.
[16:36.290 --> 16:38.150]  So I have to remember what's...
[16:38.150 --> 16:39.830]  Like dickhead truck, I don't think is one
[16:39.830 --> 16:41.650]  in this version, so I have to remember that.
[16:42.170 --> 16:43.890]  New being the wife in this one, we do a lot,
[16:43.970 --> 16:44.670]  but I don't see that.
[16:45.130 --> 16:47.710]  We'll have to work with Tony and get
[16:48.490 --> 16:49.510]  a reissue going.
[16:49.770 --> 16:52.490]  See what we can make happen for Sloppy Drews.
[16:52.830 --> 16:54.070]  You know, I gotta say...
[16:54.070 --> 16:55.910]  Oh, the shirt for Sloppy Drews that you get
[16:55.910 --> 16:58.530]  in the pox is so good. I love it.
[16:59.130 --> 17:00.130]  Oh, is that a dumb hat?
[17:00.670 --> 17:02.130]  No, it's a baseball cap.
[17:02.990 --> 17:04.170]  He's wearing it a dumb way,
[17:04.270 --> 17:05.250]  but it's because he's got dumb hair.
[17:05.710 --> 17:06.810]  I thought it was a Bulls cap.
[17:07.330 --> 17:09.010]  Probably was. Dumb team.
[17:09.830 --> 17:11.850]  Did you see their rumored City Connect
[17:11.850 --> 17:14.110]  or City Jersey or whatever that they're doing this year?
[17:14.310 --> 17:16.450]  No. It looks so bad.
[17:16.710 --> 17:18.030]  It's just black with red trim
[17:18.030 --> 17:19.410]  and it says Chicago vertically.
[17:19.730 --> 17:20.470]  It looks terrible.
[17:20.470 --> 17:22.890]  I feel like they've just given up on basketball.
[17:23.110 --> 17:24.090]  Yeah, definitely.
[17:24.350 --> 17:26.130]  I think you bring up a good point, Gavin.
[17:26.390 --> 17:28.390]  Could it be a dumb hat if it's being worn
[17:28.390 --> 17:30.770]  in a dumb way? Or does the hat itself have to be dumb?
[17:31.370 --> 17:33.070]  I guess the hat has to be dumb.
[17:33.550 --> 17:35.210]  This dude in the grey baseball cap,
[17:35.330 --> 17:36.590]  if anybody has drunk walk,
[17:36.650 --> 17:37.370]  he was doing it.
[17:38.450 --> 17:38.950]  Thank you.
[17:39.250 --> 17:40.990]  Oh, is that Mullet?
[17:41.470 --> 17:42.250]  Go, go, now!
[17:42.490 --> 17:43.550]  Go, go, now!
[17:47.250 --> 17:48.050]  That's awesome!
[17:48.050 --> 17:50.170]  Let's take a selfie!
[17:50.770 --> 17:51.970]  That's a selfie. Where are you at?
[17:51.990 --> 17:53.110]  Drop your phone!
[17:53.290 --> 17:54.030]  Now roll over!
[17:55.170 --> 17:57.170]  Take your shoes off!
[17:57.550 --> 17:59.090]  Go and do a bunch of stuff!
[17:59.270 --> 18:01.130]  Come back and do a bunch of stuff!
[18:01.410 --> 18:03.410]  Lose your job and get homeless
[18:03.410 --> 18:05.450]  and get a staph infection and be a dead parenthead.
[18:05.590 --> 18:06.630]  Come back and fight!
[18:08.030 --> 18:08.570]  Wheelchair!
[18:09.190 --> 18:10.390]  That's the first ever...
[18:10.390 --> 18:11.350]  Wait, wheelchair?
[18:13.350 --> 18:15.250]  You can't play with me, Geoff!
[18:15.250 --> 18:17.650]  That's the first wheelchair we've seen on Bingo.
[18:18.110 --> 18:18.770]  It is.
[18:20.010 --> 18:20.610]  Thanks, Nick.
[18:23.350 --> 18:25.250]  Is anybody close to Bingo?
[18:25.810 --> 18:26.210]  No.
[18:26.830 --> 18:28.110]  Not even a little.
[18:28.970 --> 18:30.170]  No, I'm all over the gaff here.
[18:30.410 --> 18:33.450]  Me too. Mine are just so scattered.
[18:34.130 --> 18:35.370]  I have three,
[18:35.810 --> 18:37.230]  but my two I think are going to be tough.
[18:37.350 --> 18:38.390]  Skateboard is a tough one,
[18:38.630 --> 18:40.930]  and then I have dead parenthead, which is not tough,
[18:41.030 --> 18:41.890]  but it's a little early.
[18:41.890 --> 18:44.270]  They don't start crawling out of their holes
[18:44.270 --> 18:44.990]  until about midnight.
[18:46.130 --> 18:48.470]  Did that guy, do you think he knew we were playing?
[18:49.050 --> 18:50.050]  Or was that just coincidental?
[18:50.270 --> 18:51.690]  If he's wearing that shirt
[18:51.690 --> 18:53.750]  and he doesn't know we're doing this right now,
[18:53.870 --> 18:54.650]  what the fuck?
[18:54.890 --> 18:56.070]  He's going to be so disappointed.
[18:58.370 --> 18:59.570]  That was so cool.
[19:00.030 --> 19:00.910]  Yeah, that was really great.
[19:00.990 --> 19:02.530]  Maybe he'll just be so appointed.
[19:06.010 --> 19:08.910]  It's kind of slow for a Friday night.
[19:08.950 --> 19:10.570]  It is a little quiet down here.
[19:11.190 --> 19:13.270]  It doesn't feel very slop o'clock.
[19:13.530 --> 19:15.110]  There's a guy riding a scooter on the sidewalk,
[19:15.290 --> 19:16.090]  I guess that's something.
[19:16.750 --> 19:18.710]  How many people can you cram on one of those
[19:18.710 --> 19:19.750]  golf carts?
[19:21.010 --> 19:22.090]  Apparently a lot.
[19:22.410 --> 19:23.390]  I think like six?
[19:26.650 --> 19:26.890]  Taxi?
[19:28.070 --> 19:28.570]  Bike?
[19:30.730 --> 19:31.730]  Pink taxi?
[19:32.770 --> 19:34.170]  Anybody with a bandage?
[19:36.450 --> 19:38.070]  I have bandage also.
[19:38.190 --> 19:40.030]  I also have can see FaceTime screen.
[19:40.030 --> 19:41.650]  The closest I'm going to get is that
[19:41.650 --> 19:43.270]  fucking taking a selfie thing.
[19:43.530 --> 19:45.150]  You never know.
[19:45.350 --> 19:47.690]  A lot of times when there's a line to get into
[19:47.690 --> 19:49.610]  Slop's, they'll be
[19:49.610 --> 19:50.970]  doing that shit on their phones.
[19:51.590 --> 19:52.910]  They're just right under the camera.
[19:53.470 --> 19:54.230]  Sometimes you get lucky.
[19:55.790 --> 19:57.910]  He got me selfie and acknowledge
[19:57.910 --> 19:58.950]  camera on the same line.
[20:00.010 --> 20:00.450]  That was great.
[20:01.730 --> 20:02.810]  Wade Boggs fan.
[20:04.370 --> 20:05.910]  If you want to play Sloppy Joe's
[20:05.910 --> 20:07.950]  bingo, you can watch
[20:07.950 --> 20:09.310]  this and do it. There's a link and everything.
[20:09.470 --> 20:11.490]  But you go to store.reacherchief.com and you get that box.
[20:11.850 --> 20:12.870]  Get the Sloppy Drew's box.
[20:13.290 --> 20:15.870]  It's what we're playing off of and it's the official bingo
[20:15.870 --> 20:16.170]  set.
[20:17.470 --> 20:19.050]  I think the dauber is so cool.
[20:19.390 --> 20:20.390]  The dauber...
[20:20.390 --> 20:24.070]  I love my dauber.
[20:24.470 --> 20:25.970]  I'm having a lot of fun using it.
[20:27.370 --> 20:28.970]  There you go. He's happy.
[20:29.610 --> 20:31.870]  Give me some formal wear. Where's somebody in a suit, bro?
[20:32.090 --> 20:33.890]  What if this dude with
[20:33.890 --> 20:35.730]  the white baseball cap took his dumb shoes off
[20:35.730 --> 20:36.970]  and walked barefoot? That would be cool.
[20:39.710 --> 20:41.490]  Look at all these people holding stuff.
[20:41.930 --> 20:42.670]  One of them is going to drop.
[20:43.250 --> 20:45.450]  We haven't had a dumb hat yet, right?
[20:45.770 --> 20:45.990]  No.
[20:47.710 --> 20:49.130]  Are these memas?
[20:49.570 --> 20:50.410]  Are we in mema territory?
[20:50.850 --> 20:51.250]  No.
[20:53.730 --> 20:54.210]  Andrew.
[20:56.770 --> 20:57.710]  They're far away.
[20:57.970 --> 20:59.550]  She looked like she was wearing formal.
[21:01.930 --> 21:02.890]  She looked...
[21:02.890 --> 21:04.710]  That, to me, was like Florida formal.
[21:04.930 --> 21:06.350]  I don't think that's quite what we're going for.
[21:06.610 --> 21:09.030]  That just meant that she was wearing a button-up shirt.
[21:09.730 --> 21:10.690]  Yeah, or a sundress.
[21:12.950 --> 21:15.030]  That was crosswalk coward, wasn't it?
[21:15.030 --> 21:16.310]  Crosswalk coward, absolutely.
[21:16.310 --> 21:16.610]  Big time.
[21:18.630 --> 21:21.570]  I don't even have crosswalk coward.
[21:21.790 --> 21:22.230]  Neither do I.
[21:22.730 --> 21:23.050]  Oh, thanks.
[21:24.630 --> 21:25.930]  Damn, I appreciate that.
[21:26.510 --> 21:27.270]  Do you have it, Andrew?
[21:28.070 --> 21:29.150]  I believe I do.
[21:30.730 --> 21:39.390]  I gotta say, I have it on the board, so I guess I need it to appear, but I always love when I don't see Kid out too late.
[21:40.250 --> 21:41.130]  Yeah, I hear that.
[21:42.350 --> 21:44.930]  You get very passionate about it whenever you see Kid out too late.
[21:44.930 --> 21:46.110]  Kids don't need to be out that late.
[21:47.510 --> 21:48.450]  It's not good for them.
[21:49.290 --> 21:53.890]  And there's nothing for them on Duval Street at fucking slop o'clock.
[21:54.950 --> 21:55.430]  Hopelessness.
[21:55.910 --> 21:56.310]  Yeah.
[21:56.670 --> 22:00.350]  A preview of how it's all gonna go wrong for them.
[22:01.610 --> 22:02.190]  That's about it.
[22:02.410 --> 22:15.110]  You know, Eric, we were talking the other day about Wade Boggs, and we were lamenting that he was retired by the Tampa Bay Rays, and we were wondering why.
[22:15.930 --> 22:19.350]  And that dude had a Rays Boggs shirt on, so I guess he must have made an impact.
[22:20.110 --> 22:21.930]  He's a hero down there, you know.
[22:22.310 --> 22:24.510]  This is the most dogshit card I've ever had.
[22:24.510 --> 22:25.130]  Really?
[22:26.170 --> 22:27.030]  What do you got on there, Gav?
[22:28.050 --> 22:29.390]  The ones I've crossed off?
[22:29.730 --> 22:31.190]  No, just like, what are you looking for?
[22:31.510 --> 22:40.190]  Oh, I've got trip, I've got puking on the ground, barefoot, jeans and flip flops, almost get hit by a car.
[22:41.010 --> 22:42.170]  I feel like they're pretty tough ones.
[22:42.490 --> 22:45.990]  Dude, every one of those is an absolute fucking moment when it happens, though.
[22:46.030 --> 22:46.150]  Yeah.
[22:46.950 --> 22:47.890]  Oh, go car?
[22:49.870 --> 22:51.290]  I have go car also.
[22:52.230 --> 22:54.610]  I'm shocked by the lack of pink taxis.
[22:54.730 --> 22:58.050]  I feel like every time I've done this, pink taxis all over the place, haven't seen one.
[22:58.250 --> 23:00.290]  It's feast or famine with those things, man.
[23:02.170 --> 23:05.270]  Dancing in American flag clothes, I'm really surprised I haven't seen yet.
[23:05.770 --> 23:06.130]  Yeah.
[23:06.690 --> 23:08.530]  This guy on the phone is stumbling.
[23:09.030 --> 23:11.110]  Yeah, that's the guy I said drunk walked earlier.
[23:12.050 --> 23:13.270]  He's having a good time.
[23:14.550 --> 23:19.410]  I need a fucking bachelorette party, and I can't believe... I saw like three earlier before we started.
[23:19.410 --> 23:21.030]  Yes. Right there.
[23:21.250 --> 23:22.070]  Oh, there we go.
[23:22.290 --> 23:23.470]  Is that not a bachelorette party?
[23:25.050 --> 23:27.450]  That is insane timing, Geoff.
[23:27.450 --> 23:29.430]  Geoff, what else do you need? Do you need trying to get into the wrong car?
[23:29.810 --> 23:33.030]  Am I the sinner of the universe? Can I control time?
[23:33.450 --> 23:35.650]  What about some twerking? How about skateboarding?
[23:36.210 --> 23:39.090]  No, I need... I think I want those... Shake hands.
[23:39.530 --> 23:40.890]  Do it. Shake hands.
[23:41.230 --> 23:42.210]  Shake his fucking hand.
[23:43.010 --> 23:43.450]  Dancing.
[23:44.430 --> 23:45.710]  We are not dancing.
[23:45.710 --> 23:47.750]  Shake your... You bitch.
[23:48.850 --> 23:50.150]  Have we had a hug yet?
[23:50.770 --> 23:50.970]  No.
[23:51.650 --> 23:53.410]  I don't think so.
[23:54.130 --> 23:55.610]  I bet we've missed one.
[23:56.050 --> 24:00.450]  Oh, that's the worst part of doing Sloppy Joe's Bingo is that all the comments are like,
[24:00.470 --> 24:02.150]  I can't believe they didn't see this seven minutes in.
[24:02.330 --> 24:03.250]  It's like, I don't know.
[24:03.870 --> 24:05.650]  What do you want us to do? We're trying to talk and see.
[24:05.950 --> 24:07.110]  And I'm dumb.
[24:08.250 --> 24:12.330]  And Gavin and I are apparently... It's past our smart... It's dumb o'clock.
[24:14.250 --> 24:15.690]  It's past smart o'clock.
[24:17.390 --> 24:18.830]  It's past our smart.
[24:19.410 --> 24:19.510]  It's past our smart.
[24:19.510 --> 24:22.110]  I got a COVID booster and a flu shot today, so I'm flying.
[24:22.730 --> 24:23.750]  Oh, nice.
[24:24.130 --> 24:24.570]  Second flag close.
[24:25.350 --> 24:26.590]  Oh, yeah, nice.
[24:28.270 --> 24:29.830]  Under armor and freedom.
[24:30.170 --> 24:30.370]  Yep.
[24:31.250 --> 24:31.670]  Okay.
[24:32.490 --> 24:35.190]  Dude, I'm still so scattered on these.
[24:35.610 --> 24:36.750]  I'm too away from a bingo.
[24:37.110 --> 24:39.110]  Do I not have American flag? I thought I did.
[24:39.290 --> 24:39.610]  Yeah, dude.
[24:41.670 --> 24:42.890]  Oh, was that a hug? No.
[24:42.890 --> 24:44.110]  What are the two that you need, Nick?
[24:45.210 --> 24:46.610]  Uh, they're not gonna happen.
[24:46.750 --> 24:48.990]  So skateboard and someone yells to wait up.
[24:49.370 --> 24:50.710]  I need two as well.
[24:50.810 --> 24:51.970]  I feel good about mine.
[24:52.050 --> 24:54.210]  I need a luxury car and aggressive honking.
[24:54.810 --> 24:57.110]  We'll see a luxury car real soon.
[24:57.410 --> 24:57.850]  By the way,
[24:58.770 --> 25:00.750]  we've kind of determined since we made these cards
[25:00.750 --> 25:02.110]  that any honking is aggressive.
[25:02.690 --> 25:02.970]  Okay.
[25:03.870 --> 25:05.630]  You know what? I appreciate that.
[25:05.730 --> 25:07.470]  If you hear honking, it's probably aggressive.
[25:08.530 --> 25:10.810]  Man, this tree is loaded right now. Look at this.
[25:10.810 --> 25:13.070]  Yeah, it got really busy all of a sudden.
[25:14.050 --> 25:14.810]  Maybe everybody
[25:14.810 --> 25:16.870]  was just running about 11 minutes late today.
[25:18.250 --> 25:18.850]  Well, they
[25:18.850 --> 25:20.790]  had to buy the magnet and the
[25:20.790 --> 25:21.630]  box.
[25:22.990 --> 25:23.470]  Yeah,
[25:24.770 --> 25:26.250]  they were in their hotels
[25:26.770 --> 25:27.910]  furiously getting refreshed.
[25:28.230 --> 25:30.310]  I think I'd call that
[25:31.110 --> 25:32.630]  convertible Mustang a luxury car.
[25:32.910 --> 25:34.830]  You think that's a luxury? I don't think I would call
[25:34.830 --> 25:35.390]  that a luxury.
[25:37.730 --> 25:38.690]  Never mind.
[25:38.690 --> 25:39.770]  Sorry, I tried to give it to you.
[25:39.810 --> 25:42.490]  No, I appreciate it. I'm not a car guy, so if you see something,
[25:43.130 --> 25:43.710]  call it out.
[25:44.450 --> 25:45.870]  Geoff, how often do you see crying?
[25:47.150 --> 25:47.510]  Crying?
[25:47.970 --> 25:48.590]  Yeah, crying.
[25:51.970 --> 25:52.930]  Every time I look
[25:52.930 --> 25:53.890]  in the mirror, Nick.
[25:55.530 --> 25:56.410]  I see it
[25:56.410 --> 25:57.330]  fairly often.
[25:58.890 --> 26:00.650]  Oh, is that a bandage on that guy?
[26:00.790 --> 26:01.650]  Or like a cast?
[26:02.070 --> 26:03.090]  Oh, I need a cast.
[26:05.430 --> 26:06.450]  I don't even
[26:06.450 --> 26:07.910]  see what you're talking about.
[26:07.970 --> 26:10.390]  The guy in the dark shirt on the left almost off
[26:10.390 --> 26:11.270]  into the road.
[26:12.610 --> 26:13.050]  What?
[26:13.610 --> 26:14.850]  No, I don't think so.
[26:15.030 --> 26:17.410]  It's got grey shorts, it's got a dark shirt.
[26:17.430 --> 26:20.510]  It looks like he's got a
[26:22.790 --> 26:23.230]  bowling
[26:23.230 --> 26:23.970]  guard on.
[26:24.350 --> 26:25.430]  Maybe he's about to go bowling.
[26:26.670 --> 26:27.110]  Juggler!
[26:27.530 --> 26:28.510]  I don't think that's a thing.
[26:30.570 --> 26:31.670]  Look at that!
[26:31.950 --> 26:34.370]  Look at that juggler. Maybe we need to start
[26:34.370 --> 26:36.190]  adding Busker back in.
[26:38.070 --> 26:38.450]  Rocky
[26:38.450 --> 26:40.030]  and Magus
[26:40.030 --> 26:41.910]  Spider-Man haven't shown up in a long time.
[26:43.030 --> 26:44.190]  Magus Spider-Man?
[26:44.690 --> 26:45.650]  Yeah, he was in a little league.
[26:45.910 --> 26:47.250]  They're dropping stuff over there.
[26:48.950 --> 26:50.250]  The juggler's to the top left.
[26:50.370 --> 26:52.190]  They're passing it and they just dropped a bunch of the balls.
[26:52.210 --> 26:52.430]  Yes!
[26:53.970 --> 26:56.270]  Oh my god. I need a handshake
[26:56.270 --> 26:58.190]  and a bandage guy. I need a handshake and a bandage guy now.
[26:58.930 --> 27:00.110]  Offensive t-shirt, wheelchair.
[27:01.710 --> 27:02.430]  I can't
[27:02.430 --> 27:04.290]  believe there's a juggling guy here.
[27:04.570 --> 27:05.310]  This is crazy.
[27:05.330 --> 27:07.810]  This really works out for him.
[27:08.290 --> 27:09.670]  Multiple juggling guys.
[27:09.850 --> 27:11.670]  That's the second juggling guy.
[27:12.430 --> 27:13.530]  Those are the juggle bros.
[27:14.850 --> 27:16.170]  He dropped it again.
[27:16.350 --> 27:17.390]  They're thinking about starting a band.
[27:17.790 --> 27:19.910]  There are so many people at this fucking place
[27:19.910 --> 27:22.110]  but none of them are going in. They're all just standing
[27:22.110 --> 27:24.590]  in crowds outside. Oh dude, this guy in the red hat?
[27:24.950 --> 27:26.450]  He's about to suck on a chili
[27:26.450 --> 27:27.010]  dog!
[27:28.070 --> 27:30.630]  We're not gonna see it. He's not gonna do it!
[27:30.630 --> 27:33.430]  We gotta see it go in!
[27:33.570 --> 27:34.410]  He didn't do it.
[27:37.630 --> 27:38.690]  How are none of these
[27:38.690 --> 27:40.590]  people formal? I agree,
[27:40.770 --> 27:41.050]  Gavin.
[27:43.210 --> 27:44.650]  I don't even...
[27:44.650 --> 27:46.710]  I'm out of the bingo. I'm just focused
[27:46.710 --> 27:47.770]  in on this juggler.
[27:50.370 --> 27:50.970]  Dead parrot?
[27:51.130 --> 27:52.150]  No, that's a Willie Nelson.
[27:52.230 --> 27:53.790]  It's Willie Nelson. It's not a dead parrot.
[27:54.150 --> 27:56.390]  I saw him and I went, we got it. And then it's like,
[27:56.430 --> 27:57.030]  nah, it's Willie Nelson.
[27:59.550 --> 28:01.590]  I like how much Andrew likes the juggler.
[28:01.770 --> 28:03.410]  I can't stop watching!
[28:03.790 --> 28:04.410]  That's a dumb hat.
[28:05.130 --> 28:08.010]  Yeah, it's pretty fucking stupid on that guy.
[28:08.150 --> 28:08.910]  That's pretty fucking dumb.
[28:09.110 --> 28:11.230]  I'm gonna give you that. That guy looks dumb and that hat is dumb.
[28:11.390 --> 28:12.370]  Let's mark it.
[28:12.550 --> 28:14.650]  Oh shit, I got Beach Goth. I haven't even been looking.
[28:15.090 --> 28:16.650]  Oh, Beach Goth's a great one, Gavin.
[28:16.970 --> 28:19.030]  I haven't seen one. I would have called out if I saw it.
[28:19.150 --> 28:19.630]  Yeah, me too.
[28:20.110 --> 28:21.750]  I don't have a dumb hat. Me neither.
[28:22.210 --> 28:22.570]  Me neither.
[28:23.630 --> 28:24.790]  I got Bouncer Bouncing.
[28:25.370 --> 28:26.470]  Oh, damn.
[28:26.950 --> 28:27.890]  Sandals and shorts.
[28:29.210 --> 28:30.850]  Now a new one that we do
[28:30.850 --> 28:32.290]  in our private lives
[28:33.110 --> 28:34.570]  is anytime you see somebody
[28:34.570 --> 28:35.950]  empty the trash, that's Oscar.
[28:37.190 --> 28:38.530]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[28:38.570 --> 28:39.550]  I like it.
[28:43.030 --> 28:44.770]  She has shades on top of her head.
[28:45.070 --> 28:47.070]  Dude, put it on your fucking nose, lady.
[28:47.270 --> 28:48.190]  Yeah, it's all down.
[28:49.090 --> 28:50.090]  Hang on!
[28:50.510 --> 28:51.610]  Don't worry about it.
[28:53.350 --> 28:54.030]  Everything's good.
[28:54.030 --> 28:55.910]  I bet a pink taxi
[28:55.910 --> 28:57.250]  shot through while that was on.
[28:58.810 --> 28:59.550]  Full speed.
[28:59.790 --> 29:01.430]  There has not been a guy on guy's scooter.
[29:02.910 --> 29:03.710]  That's crazy.
[29:04.210 --> 29:05.550]  That was a wave, not a hug.
[29:06.070 --> 29:07.150]  Somebody hug someone!
[29:07.890 --> 29:08.990]  Somebody chug something!
[29:10.890 --> 29:12.110]  Somebody yawn somewhere.
[29:14.910 --> 29:16.430]  Somebody almost get hit by a car.
[29:16.590 --> 29:17.350]  Don't get hit by a car.
[29:17.870 --> 29:18.430]  Just almost.
[29:19.630 --> 29:21.950]  Yeah, but even if they did, these cars aren't going that fast.
[29:21.950 --> 29:23.910]  I mean, if you get hit by a car, you almost
[29:23.910 --> 29:25.090]  got hit by a car, too.
[29:26.510 --> 29:27.110]  That's true.
[29:27.470 --> 29:28.510]  It led into it.
[29:29.270 --> 29:31.850]  You almost got hit by a car, and then you got hit by a car.
[29:32.890 --> 29:34.090]  You almost avoided it,
[29:34.170 --> 29:34.850]  but then you didn't.
[29:37.710 --> 29:39.810]  That's like when Bart hired Milhouse to watch
[29:39.810 --> 29:41.990]  his warehouse that he
[29:41.990 --> 29:43.870]  bought overnight, and he came
[29:43.870 --> 29:45.970]  and it was just rubble on the ground, and he's like, I told you to watch it!
[29:46.050 --> 29:46.910]  And he's like, I did watch it.
[29:47.330 --> 29:49.170]  First it started to fall, and then it fell.
[29:49.170 --> 29:50.210]  That's not the whole thing.
[29:54.130 --> 29:55.290]  Gavin, do you guys call
[29:55.290 --> 29:56.490]  accidents near misses?
[29:58.430 --> 29:59.470]  You can do, yeah.
[29:59.570 --> 30:00.370]  Well, I mean, a near miss.
[30:01.270 --> 30:02.390]  You can do?
[30:02.670 --> 30:04.170]  Get the shit out of them.
[30:04.650 --> 30:06.190]  I don't know what day it is.
[30:07.950 --> 30:09.710]  You better open a window, dude.
[30:09.850 --> 30:11.530]  You're breathing too much cat air.
[30:11.750 --> 30:13.370]  I stood here editing for like
[30:13.370 --> 30:14.770]  12 straight hours with Smee,
[30:15.130 --> 30:16.470]  and I had to open the window twice.
[30:17.050 --> 30:18.250]  He's under you right now.
[30:18.330 --> 30:19.090]  He's feeling you.
[30:19.330 --> 30:20.890]  Yeah, it was so hot today.
[30:21.590 --> 30:23.810]  Have you ever seen the movie Cat's Eye?
[30:24.490 --> 30:25.170]  Gavin? No.
[30:25.710 --> 30:26.470]  Was it about roads?
[30:27.410 --> 30:29.970]  It's about a demon
[30:29.970 --> 30:31.770]  that tries to steal people's breath, and a cat
[30:31.770 --> 30:32.530]  saves his life.
[30:32.770 --> 30:34.830]  But this is the opposite.
[30:35.070 --> 30:36.530]  This would be like the opposite.
[30:36.710 --> 30:37.630]  Like if there were a sequel.
[30:39.270 --> 30:42.590]  I think James Woods
[30:42.590 --> 30:43.890]  was in it as well, I believe.
[30:46.470 --> 30:48.170]  I almost got hit by one of these cars.
[30:48.470 --> 30:50.370]  It's too early for anybody to puke.
[30:50.530 --> 30:52.410]  The only puking you're going to get is like an old dude
[30:52.410 --> 30:54.150]  who can't drink, but he thinks he can.
[30:54.670 --> 30:55.510]  You know what I mean?
[30:55.930 --> 30:56.750]  Like he used to drink.
[31:00.490 --> 31:01.690]  Is that a tricycle?
[31:03.210 --> 31:03.570]  Yes.
[31:05.110 --> 31:06.110]  That counts, yeah.
[31:06.630 --> 31:08.310]  There's many different kinds of tricycles,
[31:08.450 --> 31:09.910]  but if it's got three wheels, I'm counting it.
[31:10.030 --> 31:11.770]  That's another one, yeah.
[31:12.670 --> 31:14.490]  Wow, I uh...
[31:14.490 --> 31:15.290]  Oh, your turn!
[31:16.470 --> 31:18.270]  But that wasn't a car!
[31:18.570 --> 31:19.950]  No, it wasn't a car.
[31:21.350 --> 31:21.470]  Oh!
[31:22.110 --> 31:22.990]  She hoofed it.
[31:24.310 --> 31:26.810]  I'm two away in so many places.
[31:26.910 --> 31:28.170]  Was that hoofing?
[31:28.510 --> 31:29.710]  I think that was hoofing.
[31:29.850 --> 31:32.030]  Was any of it formal?
[31:33.390 --> 31:34.550]  Is that a dumb shirt?
[31:35.410 --> 31:36.450]  That's not an offensive shirt.
[31:36.570 --> 31:37.570]  It has to be.
[31:37.910 --> 31:38.830]  It's matching.
[31:39.690 --> 31:40.270]  It is matching.
[31:40.270 --> 31:40.790]  It is matching.
[31:42.350 --> 31:44.790]  Gavin just sent me a video of his setup
[31:44.790 --> 31:46.910]  and me sleeping underneath it.
[31:52.070 --> 31:58.930]  Nick, can you pull that one
[31:58.930 --> 31:59.890]  for me for the break show?
[32:00.690 --> 32:01.770]  I'm definitely gonna need that.
[32:02.470 --> 32:04.390]  I just need a luxury car.
[32:05.110 --> 32:06.570]  I'm a luxury car away.
[32:06.870 --> 32:08.110]  I need the ghost tour bus.
[32:08.110 --> 32:10.370]  Oh yeah, that's passive.
[32:11.890 --> 32:13.010]  That's aggressive honking.
[32:13.650 --> 32:14.550]  Andrew, what kind of cake
[32:14.550 --> 32:15.490]  are you gonna buy for yourself?
[32:16.550 --> 32:17.690]  I'm thinking ice cream.
[32:17.850 --> 32:18.830]  I think I might go fancy.
[32:20.430 --> 32:22.450]  I respect the decision.
[32:22.810 --> 32:23.470]  There's a dog.
[32:24.350 --> 32:25.010]  Oh wow, cool.
[32:25.290 --> 32:27.230]  My wife hates cake and ice cream together.
[32:27.710 --> 32:28.930]  I think I'm pissed at this taxi.
[32:29.890 --> 32:31.410]  What is there to...
[32:31.910 --> 32:32.810]  Why does your wife hate fun?
[32:33.350 --> 32:34.670]  I don't...
[32:34.670 --> 32:36.730]  Does she like them individually?
[32:37.690 --> 32:39.110]  She'll be fine with them individually.
[32:39.690 --> 32:40.670]  What does she prefer?
[32:42.070 --> 32:43.090]  I think just cake.
[32:43.810 --> 32:45.090]  She's not a big ice cream person?
[32:45.290 --> 32:46.090]  No, I don't think so.
[32:46.150 --> 32:47.450]  But again, they can't be touching.
[32:48.310 --> 32:48.590]  What?
[32:49.130 --> 32:51.810]  I don't do it. I don't give a shit.
[32:52.310 --> 32:54.610]  There's lots of people that don't like ice cream.
[32:54.750 --> 32:55.690]  You know who doesn't like ice cream?
[32:56.530 --> 32:56.890]  Communists.
[32:58.010 --> 32:59.130]  Yeah, I think that's fine though.
[32:59.230 --> 33:01.950]  I don't think it's 1951, so I think it's fine if you're a communist.
[33:01.950 --> 33:03.210]  Oh, they got a noob.
[33:03.810 --> 33:04.370]  Is it the right one?
[33:05.350 --> 33:06.230]  He's waving someone over.
[33:07.330 --> 33:08.130]  He waved.
[33:08.410 --> 33:11.230]  Yeah, but it wasn't waved up. He was saying, come here.
[33:11.730 --> 33:12.590]  That's a pickup.
[33:14.010 --> 33:14.790]  That is a pickup.
[33:16.290 --> 33:17.430]  Has anybody seen a cop car?
[33:17.950 --> 33:18.210]  No.
[33:18.450 --> 33:19.730]  So that wasn't a waved up?
[33:20.370 --> 33:21.550]  No, that was not a waved up.
[33:22.770 --> 33:23.850]  Are you sure?
[33:25.670 --> 33:29.330]  How was him calling someone over to them a waved up?
[33:29.450 --> 33:30.710]  Hey, waved up, we got this car.
[33:30.710 --> 33:32.690]  But he's standing still.
[33:32.930 --> 33:34.270]  Gotta be Nick.
[33:35.050 --> 33:37.350]  Hey, don't come over here, this car's for us.
[33:37.590 --> 33:39.950]  Hey, stop waiting up over there.
[33:40.050 --> 33:40.850]  Wait up over here.
[33:41.570 --> 33:43.850]  Wait up over there, in here, in the car.
[33:43.950 --> 33:44.650]  We have to get it.
[33:46.170 --> 33:47.210]  Dude, that guy
[33:47.970 --> 33:49.270]  behind that lady in white
[33:49.270 --> 33:51.010]  is fucking wide.
[33:51.990 --> 33:52.450]  Whoa.
[33:53.030 --> 33:53.410]  Dude.
[33:54.950 --> 33:56.850]  That guy's shoulders have shoulders.
[33:57.370 --> 33:57.710]  Come on.
[33:58.630 --> 33:59.350]  Wrong car.
[34:00.250 --> 34:01.330]  That's what you look like.
[34:01.450 --> 34:03.870]  I look that good?
[34:04.350 --> 34:04.830]  Holy shit.
[34:05.470 --> 34:07.530]  You look like you get in the front seat of an Uber.
[34:08.830 --> 34:09.830]  Do you have a buddy
[34:09.830 --> 34:11.650]  who goes around with sandals and socks?
[34:13.030 --> 34:13.810]  I wish.
[34:14.090 --> 34:14.650]  That'd be Dan.
[34:15.070 --> 34:15.510]  He does.
[34:23.030 --> 34:23.990]  Come on.
[34:24.170 --> 34:25.150]  Almost hit someone.
[34:25.150 --> 34:27.190]  Watching like 500 people
[34:27.190 --> 34:29.250]  successfully navigate up that curb
[34:29.250 --> 34:30.510]  is really frustrating.
[34:30.990 --> 34:31.550]  Yeah.
[34:32.730 --> 34:35.330]  Oh, that's the guy who's lost his other two friends.
[34:35.650 --> 34:35.910]  Yeah.
[34:36.910 --> 34:38.790]  They might just be the same guys.
[34:39.650 --> 34:39.870]  Hmm.
[34:40.270 --> 34:42.650]  Is that his twin?
[34:43.570 --> 34:45.430]  There's just a lot of the same kind of guy
[34:45.430 --> 34:46.810]  here tonight. Did we just find a glitch?
[34:50.210 --> 34:53.250]  This is like when Neo saw the black cat walk by twice.
[34:55.150 --> 34:56.670]  Are they trying to interact with the bridal party?
[34:57.210 --> 34:59.570]  Oh, it's getting loud over there.
[34:59.690 --> 35:00.970]  We might be seeing
[35:00.970 --> 35:02.970]  the beginnings of a fight here.
[35:02.990 --> 35:03.210]  Dude.
[35:04.210 --> 35:06.690]  Oh, that's the sparkliest shit I've ever seen. Look at that.
[35:06.990 --> 35:07.250]  Wow.
[35:07.770 --> 35:08.930]  Is that formal?
[35:10.070 --> 35:10.510]  No.
[35:11.390 --> 35:12.190]  That's party wear.
[35:14.870 --> 35:15.970]  That's not formal wear.
[35:16.630 --> 35:18.890]  Dude, I would get my
[35:18.890 --> 35:21.170]  fucking ass chewed out by Emily if I called that formal wear.
[35:21.810 --> 35:22.250]  Jesus.
[35:22.250 --> 35:24.190]  It feels very strongly about it.
[35:24.950 --> 35:26.430]  Does anyone have bikini
[35:26.430 --> 35:26.950]  on the outside?
[35:27.770 --> 35:27.970]  No.
[35:33.010 --> 35:35.990]  It looks like she skinned a disco ball.
[35:37.430 --> 35:38.050]  Absolutely.
[35:39.550 --> 35:40.490]  You guys on a scooter?
[35:40.930 --> 35:41.390]  No.
[35:44.790 --> 35:46.370]  It must be hot
[35:46.370 --> 35:47.830]  down there, huh?
[35:48.290 --> 35:49.450]  We'll find out someday.
[35:49.450 --> 35:51.550]  If they hung that woman from the top
[35:51.550 --> 35:53.570]  and she spat her out, it'd be so amazing.
[35:53.970 --> 35:55.790]  We can all shine our phone flashlights
[35:55.790 --> 35:56.830]  at her and then we'll have a party.
[35:57.190 --> 35:59.330]  Just make her spit in a circle in the middle of the room.
[36:02.130 --> 36:03.150]  She's wearing Uggs?
[36:03.250 --> 36:04.730]  Those are Uggs slippers?
[36:05.210 --> 36:06.470]  Yeah. Wow.
[36:07.810 --> 36:08.570]  Are those comfortable?
[36:09.450 --> 36:11.050]  Comfortable and fashion-forward.
[36:11.070 --> 36:12.250]  Is that a dead parrot?
[36:12.870 --> 36:15.050]  No, I was looking at him.
[36:15.250 --> 36:19.430]  He's more like a...
[36:19.430 --> 36:20.290]  wannabe pirate guy.
[36:22.310 --> 36:23.350]  His face isn't
[36:23.350 --> 36:25.230]  sunken in from years of living
[36:25.230 --> 36:27.030]  under a bridge like a dead parrot head.
[36:27.370 --> 36:28.570]  I hear that.
[36:28.990 --> 36:30.770]  I was reaching. I'm just looking for a hit here, baby.
[36:30.850 --> 36:31.370]  I hear you.
[36:33.710 --> 36:35.190]  That might be a formal dress
[36:35.190 --> 36:36.070]  on the other side of the street.
[36:36.090 --> 36:39.010]  I was looking at it too. I think it's just a white sundress.
[36:39.230 --> 36:41.470]  If you wouldn't give it to me on the disco,
[36:41.670 --> 36:43.590]  I can't imagine that you'd give it to me on the sundress.
[36:44.050 --> 36:45.750]  Take a look when she gets across the street.
[36:46.550 --> 36:47.450]  Take a look at
[36:47.450 --> 36:48.530]  my sundress.
[36:54.610 --> 36:59.430]  Do y'all see this dude's hair
[36:59.430 --> 37:00.870]  in the bottom right?
[37:01.130 --> 37:03.530]  Yes, I do. I wasn't gonna say
[37:03.530 --> 37:05.190]  anything, but it's interesting.
[37:06.230 --> 37:06.250]  Yeah.
[37:06.730 --> 37:08.870]  You can't really tell now.
[37:09.030 --> 37:11.190]  The guy in the yellow shirt walking away. You can't really tell.
[37:11.330 --> 37:13.770]  It's not a comb-over. It's a comb-up.
[37:14.050 --> 37:16.050]  It was like a...
[37:16.050 --> 37:16.850]  Comb-up-a-dove-a?
[37:18.450 --> 37:19.630]  Real middle hair.
[37:19.890 --> 37:21.630]  It's kind of like when you get ice cream
[37:21.630 --> 37:23.450]  at an all-you-can-eat buffet
[37:23.450 --> 37:25.990]  and you get it yourself and it makes a little swirl to the top.
[37:26.110 --> 37:27.610]  It was like the hair version of that.
[37:28.050 --> 37:29.990]  Look at that floppy
[37:29.990 --> 37:31.290]  dress. Is that the same?
[37:32.150 --> 37:33.650]  I don't think it's formal.
[37:33.910 --> 37:34.730]  Take a right.
[37:36.090 --> 37:36.530]  Let's see.
[37:37.270 --> 37:38.970]  I would love it to be formal.
[37:40.070 --> 37:40.610]  I know.
[37:41.410 --> 37:43.670]  The problem is we can't get confirmation
[37:43.670 --> 37:44.350]  one way or the other.
[37:45.870 --> 37:47.410]  Unless she comes this way.
[37:47.630 --> 37:49.610]  Guy who was wearing the go-go-now shirt.
[37:49.770 --> 37:51.510]  Put on a suit. Come back.
[37:52.710 --> 37:53.770]  We should have a
[37:53.770 --> 37:56.030]  Jesus category for all the dudes with long hair.
[37:56.470 --> 37:57.010]  Cowboy boots.
[37:57.230 --> 37:58.190]  Chug that beer, Jesus.
[37:59.010 --> 38:00.410]  Those aren't cowboy boots.
[38:00.710 --> 38:01.630]  He's wearing sunglasses.
[38:03.990 --> 38:04.830]  Sunglasses at night?
[38:05.350 --> 38:06.670]  That's the same car from earlier.
[38:06.870 --> 38:07.890]  Was there sunglasses at night?
[38:09.730 --> 38:10.610]  Hell yeah.
[38:10.610 --> 38:11.730]  Nighttime shades.
[38:12.250 --> 38:13.810]  Where are my jeans and flip flops at?
[38:13.890 --> 38:15.290]  And who is this guy in all these shirts?
[38:15.450 --> 38:17.090]  I'm a pink taxi away as well.
[38:17.170 --> 38:20.290]  I need either a pink taxi or a luxury car.
[38:20.490 --> 38:21.490]  Handshake and a bandage.
[38:22.610 --> 38:23.910]  I'd kill for a skateboard.
[38:24.630 --> 38:26.650]  I am so close in so many different ways.
[38:28.030 --> 38:29.630]  I had a cigar or something.
[38:29.630 --> 38:30.210]  I was going to say
[38:30.210 --> 38:32.450]  Key West with a cigar? I like that.
[38:32.530 --> 38:33.130]  That's formal?
[38:34.110 --> 38:35.410]  Is that formal?
[38:36.290 --> 38:38.490]  Here's the answer from Emily who just texted me.
[38:39.370 --> 38:40.610]  Formal wear is when
[38:40.610 --> 38:41.870]  they came from a wedding.
[38:42.050 --> 38:44.510]  If it isn't wedding appropriate, it isn't formal wear.
[38:44.610 --> 38:46.750]  Party club wear isn't formal wear.
[38:46.890 --> 38:47.690]  That's very specific.
[38:47.930 --> 38:48.830]  Oh, crew squad.
[38:49.790 --> 38:51.770]  These girls are new boot goofing.
[38:51.910 --> 38:54.150]  Hug each other. Somebody hug!
[38:54.570 --> 38:54.870]  Hug.
[38:55.910 --> 38:58.130]  There has been an alarming lack of hugs.
[38:58.550 --> 39:00.430]  Yeah, everybody's pretty standoffish tonight.
[39:00.510 --> 39:01.090]  Where's the love?
[39:01.930 --> 39:04.110]  Oh, making out.
[39:04.930 --> 39:05.470]  Weird.
[39:05.470 --> 39:08.250]  I got double fisted!
[39:08.530 --> 39:09.250]  Does anybody have double fisted?
[39:09.290 --> 39:10.670]  Oh, yeah, there's a double fist right there.
[39:11.550 --> 39:12.630]  I don't have it.
[39:12.750 --> 39:14.170]  I don't have it either.
[39:15.390 --> 39:16.430]  You know what's fucking sad?
[39:16.970 --> 39:20.290]  Earlier, when I watched a guy not eat a chili dog.
[39:20.570 --> 39:20.750]  Yeah.
[39:22.430 --> 39:23.410]  That was terrible.
[39:23.770 --> 39:24.850]  I felt bad for him in that moment.
[39:25.390 --> 39:27.130]  I think we're seeing the beginnings of something here.
[39:27.410 --> 39:27.610]  Yeah.
[39:28.830 --> 39:31.010]  Sorry, bro.
[39:31.210 --> 39:32.290]  What do you want me to do?
[39:32.290 --> 39:33.530]  Did they know each other?
[39:34.190 --> 39:34.810]  I hope not.
[39:35.130 --> 39:37.690]  I hope so, otherwise that's assault.
[39:37.890 --> 39:39.210]  I like his big fake chain.
[39:39.390 --> 39:41.170]  Oh, yeah, he's doing the fist bump.
[39:41.330 --> 39:43.430]  Shake hands, you fucker!
[39:48.550 --> 39:50.490]  I don't think you bump and shake.
[39:50.630 --> 39:51.490]  I think it's either or.
[39:52.630 --> 39:55.290]  What if we invented the bump and shake?
[39:56.330 --> 39:58.250]  It's like the worst of both worlds.
[40:00.130 --> 40:01.450]  Double turn down.
[40:02.290 --> 40:03.030]  That guy had a big head.
[40:03.030 --> 40:03.710]  That bike just dodged.
[40:03.870 --> 40:05.170]  That was a pro move right there.
[40:05.870 --> 40:08.010]  Dude, Emily and I saw a dude crash on an e-bike the other day.
[40:08.070 --> 40:09.050]  Did I tell you about that in the episode?
[40:09.150 --> 40:09.270]  Really?
[40:09.630 --> 40:10.630]  It was so fucking funny.
[40:13.230 --> 40:16.810]  We were leaving an estate sale in this fancy-ass neighborhood,
[40:16.910 --> 40:17.530]  walking up a hill,
[40:17.630 --> 40:19.710]  and a dude zoomed by me on an e-bike,
[40:19.870 --> 40:20.550]  and I was looking at it.
[40:21.090 --> 40:21.910]  I'm an e-bike guy.
[40:22.150 --> 40:23.230]  I was trying to see what brand it was,
[40:23.230 --> 40:24.270]  and he just went by me.
[40:24.730 --> 40:25.950]  And I turned to Emily, and I was like,
[40:26.030 --> 40:27.010]  that guy's driving a little fast.
[40:27.070 --> 40:28.530]  And we just heard, like,
[40:28.650 --> 40:29.690]  and we turned around,
[40:29.770 --> 40:31.830]  and the dude was just rolling through somebody's front yard.
[40:33.410 --> 40:34.870]  And he jumped up, like,
[40:34.950 --> 40:35.610]  I'm okay, I'm okay,
[40:35.670 --> 40:37.290]  and he got on his bike and took the fuck off.
[40:39.390 --> 40:40.490]  It was really...
[40:40.490 --> 40:42.490]  There were tons of people walking into their cars
[40:42.490 --> 40:43.390]  from the estate sale, too.
[40:45.130 --> 40:46.010]  Definitely high visibility.
[40:46.730 --> 40:48.170]  Alright, one of these has to hug someone.
[40:48.170 --> 40:48.390]  Yeah.
[40:49.570 --> 40:51.070]  It's gotta hug!
[40:52.610 --> 40:54.350]  Wrap each other up in a bandage.
[40:54.510 --> 40:55.630]  It has to be a luxury vehicle.
[40:55.750 --> 40:57.830]  Like Chris Farley says, brothers gotta hug.
[40:59.990 --> 41:00.910]  That's a dumb hat.
[41:03.510 --> 41:04.750]  I don't know that.
[41:04.750 --> 41:05.630]  We already got that one.
[41:05.790 --> 41:07.190]  We're just being judgmental now.
[41:08.130 --> 41:10.210]  Guys, we got a new security guy.
[41:10.630 --> 41:11.090]  Oh, yeah?
[41:11.630 --> 41:13.250]  Is that on there? No.
[41:13.730 --> 41:14.850]  I've just never seen him work before.
[41:14.850 --> 41:17.010]  Oh, here comes a scooter. Are there two guys on the scooter?
[41:17.810 --> 41:18.910]  It's entirely possible.
[41:19.270 --> 41:20.230]  Come on.
[41:20.610 --> 41:22.350]  That lady's dancing. Oh, she's twerking.
[41:22.630 --> 41:23.470]  Yeah, that's twerking.
[41:23.590 --> 41:25.330]  Hell yeah, got it.
[41:25.610 --> 41:27.230]  Here we go.
[41:28.550 --> 41:30.130]  I need a litter bug, actually.
[41:30.470 --> 41:31.270]  Litter bug.
[41:35.510 --> 41:36.450]  Skateboard would be good.
[41:36.630 --> 41:37.670]  Handshake would be good.
[41:38.070 --> 41:39.310]  Firetruck wouldn't be bad.
[41:39.770 --> 41:40.770]  Here's a scooter!
[41:42.030 --> 41:42.670]  Damn it.
[41:43.130 --> 41:43.970]  Nice one.
[41:47.790 --> 41:48.670]  That lady...
[41:51.110 --> 41:52.670]  I was going to say maybe
[41:52.670 --> 41:54.590]  beach goth, but I don't think so.
[41:54.750 --> 41:56.930]  She just happens to be wearing all black.
[41:57.410 --> 41:58.950]  What's this guy doing with his legs?
[41:58.970 --> 42:00.670]  He's almost doing the sewing machine.
[42:04.270 --> 42:05.850]  That dude dicked him real fast.
[42:07.470 --> 42:08.150]  Break check.
[42:13.130 --> 42:14.290]  It's so frustrating
[42:14.290 --> 42:17.190]  to just be one away for more than five minutes.
[42:17.430 --> 42:18.810]  It's just killing me.
[42:18.810 --> 42:19.450]  It's so painful.
[42:21.190 --> 42:22.970]  Yeah, we're all very sad for you.
[42:23.550 --> 42:23.730]  Hug!
[42:26.410 --> 42:27.850]  Has anyone got flash flood?
[42:28.070 --> 42:28.430]  Chug!
[42:30.830 --> 42:31.410]  Hug.
[42:31.450 --> 42:33.190]  Chug, chug, chug, chug.
[42:34.310 --> 42:34.890]  Yeah!
[42:36.710 --> 42:38.350]  That was close, but no.
[42:39.210 --> 42:39.790]  Close.
[42:39.790 --> 42:39.830]  Close.
[42:42.870 --> 42:45.170]  Where the fuck are the pink taxis?
[42:45.570 --> 42:46.650]  Where are they?
[42:47.130 --> 42:49.210]  It must be too hot for blue jeans.
[42:49.750 --> 42:51.110]  I mean, it usually is,
[42:51.130 --> 42:52.370]  but it doesn't stop people from wearing them.
[42:52.670 --> 42:53.830]  It must be extra too hot.
[42:54.730 --> 42:56.070]  She's swinging that beer bottle.
[42:59.270 --> 43:00.150]  Litter bug.
[43:03.250 --> 43:04.310]  She's yelling at somebody.
[43:04.750 --> 43:04.950]  Who?
[43:05.610 --> 43:06.730]  Wait up, she said.
[43:07.710 --> 43:08.010]  Mate,
[43:08.210 --> 43:10.730]  I thought it was maybe heading that direction, but...
[43:15.120 --> 43:17.660]  Did I tell you guys about the night that I saw...
[43:17.660 --> 43:19.540]  I don't think I filmed it, because it just didn't...
[43:19.540 --> 43:21.620]  I tried, but it didn't look good, so I never showed it to you guys,
[43:21.700 --> 43:23.440]  but the night I saw
[43:23.440 --> 43:25.300]  somebody try to hand in a fake ID
[43:25.300 --> 43:27.140]  to the bouncer, and he threw it in the street,
[43:27.320 --> 43:27.900]  and it hit a car.
[43:29.920 --> 43:31.540]  It was a girl, and she had to go
[43:31.540 --> 43:33.040]  run out and pick it up out of the middle of the street.
[43:33.380 --> 43:34.640]  That's fucking awesome.
[43:35.920 --> 43:37.240]  Man, that sounds good.
[43:38.220 --> 43:40.700]  That's some good new haircuts out there tonight.
[43:43.200 --> 43:44.580]  People looking fresh.
[43:48.260 --> 43:50.400]  That guy's Chuck Taylor's
[43:50.400 --> 43:51.100]  match his shorts.
[43:51.600 --> 43:52.840]  That's too much coordination.
[43:53.320 --> 43:54.000]  I think it's great.
[43:55.080 --> 43:56.120]  Get weird with it.
[43:56.360 --> 43:57.920]  Not match your shirt, match your shorts.
[44:05.070 --> 44:06.990]  Somebody better almost get hit by a car.
[44:07.190 --> 44:08.850]  You know, I'm surprised
[44:08.850 --> 44:10.330]  we haven't seen an offensive t-shirt.
[44:10.450 --> 44:12.510]  Usually there's almost as many of those
[44:12.510 --> 44:13.730]  as American flag apparel.
[44:13.970 --> 44:16.410]  Yeah, and we've only seen one like American flag clothes.
[44:16.710 --> 44:18.410]  Why do you keep pronouncing it offensive?
[44:19.030 --> 44:19.870]  Yeah, I don't...
[44:19.870 --> 44:22.370]  He keeps saying it's so weird, but I mean, it's fine.
[44:23.130 --> 44:23.690]  What am I saying?
[44:24.670 --> 44:26.070]  You're not saying offensive,
[44:26.330 --> 44:28.270]  you're saying offensive, like they're playing
[44:28.270 --> 44:29.450]  for the... Oh, am I?
[44:29.610 --> 44:30.050]  Yeah.
[44:30.050 --> 44:31.370]  I didn't realize.
[44:31.410 --> 44:33.150]  You're about to take the ball and go for the...
[44:33.150 --> 44:35.970]  How about I never say it that way again
[44:35.970 --> 44:38.150]  and then I apologize profusely and then you guys forgive me
[44:38.150 --> 44:39.550]  and then we move on. Happy idea.
[44:39.890 --> 44:41.690]  Alright. You're forgiven.
[44:42.450 --> 44:43.870]  You approve of this hair, Gavin?
[44:44.050 --> 44:45.210]  How do you feel about the hair going on here?
[44:46.170 --> 44:47.170]  Looking fresh, man.
[44:48.130 --> 44:49.990]  Take that dog home and give him some water.
[44:52.410 --> 44:54.390]  Dogs don't go to bars, they don't drink booze.
[44:54.570 --> 44:56.370]  Now, if the guy with the dog
[44:57.170 --> 44:58.350]  was... could he be a
[44:58.350 --> 44:59.570]  meemaw? If that was a grandma?
[45:00.670 --> 45:02.270]  Like, is that the vibe? I don't really know
[45:02.270 --> 45:03.130]  what a meemaw is.
[45:03.490 --> 45:06.790]  It's, well, you know it when you see it.
[45:07.550 --> 45:08.390]  I don't know.
[45:08.630 --> 45:10.110]  Well, first off, he's not.
[45:10.310 --> 45:12.430]  If he was a lady and he had
[45:12.430 --> 45:13.870]  a beard and... I don't know.
[45:14.350 --> 45:15.590]  Oh, is that jeans and flip flops?
[45:16.050 --> 45:16.270]  Where?
[45:19.210 --> 45:20.090]  The woman
[45:20.090 --> 45:21.350]  crossing the road right now?
[45:22.370 --> 45:22.590]  What?
[45:24.690 --> 45:26.390]  I don't see it at all.
[45:26.390 --> 45:27.370]  Are you making...
[45:27.370 --> 45:29.010]  Are you watching the same feed as us?
[45:29.330 --> 45:31.990]  She's now walking to the left of the other side of the street.
[45:32.030 --> 45:34.230]  You know what? That might be.
[45:34.330 --> 45:35.210]  Oh, I can't tell.
[45:36.690 --> 45:37.430]  I can't tell.
[45:37.570 --> 45:39.730]  Why isn't that guy...
[45:39.730 --> 45:40.270]  What is that guy doing?
[45:41.850 --> 45:42.530]  Petting a dog.
[45:45.190 --> 45:46.370]  Geoff, can we do a
[45:46.370 --> 45:47.710]  peepaw in addition to a meemaw?
[45:48.430 --> 45:48.830]  Interesting.
[45:49.750 --> 45:50.330]  Yeah, potentially.
[45:51.250 --> 45:53.570]  I mean, it's not on the board, but...
[45:53.570 --> 45:54.290]  But yeah, potentially.
[45:54.710 --> 45:56.930]  Andrew, I can't believe there have been no luxury cars.
[45:57.590 --> 45:57.750]  Yeah.
[45:59.130 --> 46:01.150]  Zero point taxis, no luxury cars.
[46:01.330 --> 46:02.390]  It's been a disaster.
[46:02.610 --> 46:03.410]  I thought I had it.
[46:03.410 --> 46:06.290]  I saw one of those earlier.
[46:06.850 --> 46:09.310]  A meemaw, Andrew, would be if you saw
[46:09.310 --> 46:11.070]  a sweet old lady
[46:11.070 --> 46:13.070]  and you saw her and your first instinct
[46:13.070 --> 46:14.390]  was to go help her walk.
[46:14.650 --> 46:16.770]  Yes, that's a great description.
[46:17.330 --> 46:18.770]  Okay. That helps.
[46:20.270 --> 46:21.210]  There was something
[46:21.210 --> 46:23.130]  so funny about when you guys were trying
[46:23.130 --> 46:24.830]  to get info on Gavin on what he saw
[46:24.830 --> 46:26.850]  and him just going, ugh, because he knew
[46:26.850 --> 46:28.970]  he was hopeless.
[46:30.850 --> 46:31.890]  He gave up
[46:31.890 --> 46:32.490]  in that moment.
[46:32.550 --> 46:35.010]  It took him like 20 seconds after that
[46:35.010 --> 46:36.770]  to actually leave the frame, but he just knew
[46:36.770 --> 46:38.250]  that nobody was going to see him.
[46:38.470 --> 46:41.110]  I was 20% describing, 80%
[46:41.110 --> 46:41.830]  giving up.
[46:44.150 --> 46:45.310]  What about the rest of you?
[46:46.470 --> 46:47.690]  You don't want to know.
[46:47.910 --> 46:48.410]  I appreciate that.
[46:48.410 --> 46:49.370]  The rest of the percentage.
[46:49.650 --> 46:51.370]  How come no one's hugging?
[46:51.710 --> 46:52.970]  How come no one's shaking hands?
[46:54.110 --> 46:56.430]  If they hugged the dog, does that count
[46:56.430 --> 46:56.930]  as a hug?
[46:58.450 --> 47:00.390]  Does it have to be a human-on-human hug?
[47:00.690 --> 47:02.030]  No, I don't think we ever specified that.
[47:02.030 --> 47:04.290]  I think it needs to be reciprocated, doesn't it?
[47:04.450 --> 47:04.690]  Yeah.
[47:05.250 --> 47:07.370]  A hug is two ways.
[47:08.590 --> 47:09.230]  The beige boys.
[47:11.130 --> 47:12.010]  Oh, this guy's got a
[47:13.270 --> 47:14.230]  bit of a strut.
[47:14.510 --> 47:14.910]  I don't know, guys.
[47:15.550 --> 47:17.150]  I wanted that car to start going
[47:17.150 --> 47:17.910]  and almost hit him, you know?
[47:18.010 --> 47:19.050]  He's probably excited.
[47:21.790 --> 47:22.670]  He went...
[47:25.070 --> 47:26.250]  You feeling good?
[47:27.950 --> 47:28.390]  Fight!
[47:29.670 --> 47:30.970]  This sidewalk is
[47:31.470 --> 47:32.750]  pristine. No one's dropped
[47:32.750 --> 47:33.570]  anything.
[47:35.330 --> 47:36.410]  Yeah, people are being very
[47:36.850 --> 47:38.490]  responsible and respectful tonight.
[47:38.770 --> 47:40.550]  I don't like it.
[47:40.910 --> 47:42.650]  What's that shirt? Is that a fence? I can't tell.
[47:42.650 --> 47:44.590]  It said something bang, but...
[47:44.590 --> 47:46.970]  Oh, this guy's about to have fun. He just flipped his hat around.
[47:47.190 --> 47:47.550]  Hell yeah.
[47:48.190 --> 47:49.430]  And he's about to touch his dick.
[47:49.590 --> 47:52.290]  Yeah, get your hand in there.
[47:52.390 --> 47:53.390]  There we go, buddy!
[47:53.910 --> 47:54.290]  Yeah!
[47:56.330 --> 47:58.650]  That was a full-blown readjustment.
[47:59.030 --> 48:00.170]  Geez, that was great.
[48:00.170 --> 48:01.590]  It went from 6 to midnight.
[48:01.970 --> 48:03.470]  Oh, now he's yawning. Yawning is one.
[48:03.570 --> 48:05.190]  I got that.
[48:06.390 --> 48:08.390]  I just see trying to get in the wrong car.
[48:12.230 --> 48:13.690]  Oh, he's not taking a show?
[48:14.230 --> 48:15.150]  No, he's putting...
[48:15.150 --> 48:16.950]  He's decided he's showing too much.
[48:18.310 --> 48:19.450]  He's covering up a little bit.
[48:19.570 --> 48:20.690]  He just saw the camera.
[48:21.530 --> 48:22.270]  Oh, is he camera shy?
[48:22.670 --> 48:23.890]  No, I don't think so.
[48:25.690 --> 48:26.130]  He's...
[48:28.270 --> 48:29.530]  He's having fun.
[48:29.550 --> 48:31.270]  He's having fun in Key West, baby.
[48:31.270 --> 48:32.010]  He's fine.
[48:33.310 --> 48:35.550]  Oh, fuck.
[48:35.890 --> 48:36.830]  That was...
[48:36.830 --> 48:38.370]  That was terrible.
[48:38.370 --> 48:40.430]  That was close. I'm not going to count it as almost hit by a car.
[48:41.010 --> 48:41.230]  Yeah.
[48:42.250 --> 48:43.530]  That guy was almost hit by a car.
[48:44.410 --> 48:46.490]  I think we already got it, anyway.
[48:46.870 --> 48:47.450]  I don't think so.
[48:47.650 --> 48:48.910]  I don't think there's been almost hit by a car.
[48:51.770 --> 48:52.390]  You okay, Nick?
[48:52.810 --> 48:53.690]  Oh, that cyclist.
[48:54.410 --> 48:56.110]  They were pulling in front of the other car.
[48:56.330 --> 48:57.710]  And I thought, well...
[48:57.710 --> 48:59.110]  Got your backpack, huh, buddy?
[48:59.670 --> 49:00.190]  That's cool.
[49:02.430 --> 49:04.490]  Carry around all your books and stuff at the bar.
[49:04.930 --> 49:05.210]  Mollet!
[49:05.210 --> 49:05.250]  What?
[49:06.390 --> 49:06.810]  Where?
[49:08.390 --> 49:10.770]  Yeah, dude, that's a mollet.
[49:11.210 --> 49:12.870]  That's 100% mollet with a dad hat.
[49:13.210 --> 49:14.110]  And he's dancing.
[49:14.330 --> 49:15.690]  We already had dancing, but he's dancing.
[49:17.370 --> 49:18.890]  We got 10 minutes to get a bingo.
[49:19.310 --> 49:20.410]  There's another dog!
[49:20.830 --> 49:22.710]  We don't go until we get bingo?
[49:23.590 --> 49:25.730]  We got... Fisher has to leave in 15.
[49:26.510 --> 49:27.030]  Oh, no.
[49:27.350 --> 49:28.370]  So we have 15 minutes, then.
[49:28.490 --> 49:31.170]  We got...
[49:31.170 --> 49:32.930]  Hey, don't sell us short, Eric. Come on.
[49:32.930 --> 49:34.970]  I was trying to build in some time for Fisher.
[49:37.670 --> 49:40.570]  Well, all I need is a dead parrot head on a skateboard, and I win.
[49:40.910 --> 49:41.870]  Trying to get in a car.
[49:42.410 --> 49:43.470]  Trying to get in the wrong car.
[49:43.790 --> 49:45.610]  I want a Funfetti cake, I think.
[49:47.090 --> 49:48.290]  I love Funfetti.
[49:49.030 --> 49:49.950]  Funfetti's a great cake.
[49:50.010 --> 49:51.450]  You know what, Nick? Maybe I'll cut you a slice.
[49:51.810 --> 49:52.470]  Oh, thank you, man.
[49:52.930 --> 49:54.670]  Have you seen any beach goths yet?
[49:55.310 --> 49:56.330]  Not that I've seen.
[49:57.850 --> 49:59.910]  No, I always have my eye open for the beach goths.
[50:01.510 --> 50:03.270]  They stand out to me.
[50:04.250 --> 50:05.630]  They speak to me.
[50:07.350 --> 50:08.270]  They're my people.
[50:08.770 --> 50:08.890]  Yeah.
[50:09.810 --> 50:11.170]  There's been no kids.
[50:12.810 --> 50:13.830]  No kids out late.
[50:14.090 --> 50:16.070]  Good machine coming off this guy's head.
[50:16.910 --> 50:19.330]  Oh, God.
[50:19.450 --> 50:21.130]  That was the wrong time to take a drink of water.
[50:25.550 --> 50:27.490]  We need a bandage, dude.
[50:27.610 --> 50:28.890]  Everybody seems healthy tonight.
[50:30.250 --> 50:31.250]  Don't know wheelchair.
[50:31.890 --> 50:33.150]  Everybody seems healthy.
[50:33.250 --> 50:34.890]  Andrew, you're like, uh...
[50:36.150 --> 50:36.390]  Oh, wait.
[50:38.450 --> 50:39.970]  I see them all the time when you're not around.
[50:41.090 --> 50:42.210]  Gavin, what are we waiting for?
[50:42.650 --> 50:43.970]  What's that thing on the ground there?
[50:44.730 --> 50:46.730]  Is that always that little thing next to the black thing?
[50:47.770 --> 50:48.330]  I don't know.
[50:48.690 --> 50:51.190]  No, that's not always there.
[50:51.710 --> 50:52.010]  I don't know.
[50:52.670 --> 50:53.750]  Somebody dropped something.
[50:55.090 --> 50:55.990]  When was that?
[50:55.990 --> 50:58.190]  Like a wallet or a phone?
[50:58.550 --> 50:59.930]  No, they'd see it.
[51:00.370 --> 51:01.670]  Step? It can't be.
[51:01.910 --> 51:03.950]  She just stepped on it.
[51:04.490 --> 51:05.410]  Must be nothing.
[51:05.810 --> 51:06.890]  Yeah, I think it's just nothing.
[51:08.610 --> 51:10.570]  Thanks for wasting our time, Gavin.
[51:11.010 --> 51:11.630]  Sorry, man.
[51:12.310 --> 51:13.110]  It's okay.
[51:14.250 --> 51:16.130]  I'm sorry about the offensive thing.
[51:20.770 --> 51:21.850]  Oh, a bit of leg.
[51:22.250 --> 51:23.050]  Oh, a little leg.
[51:23.050 --> 51:23.910]  Drink swap.
[51:26.690 --> 51:28.810]  That was a terrible handoff.
[51:30.030 --> 51:30.530]  Drop the drink.
[51:32.190 --> 51:32.630]  Spill.
[51:34.050 --> 51:35.250]  And don't pick it up.
[51:35.710 --> 51:36.590]  Yeah, leave it.
[51:41.490 --> 51:42.750]  I must have missed.
[51:43.070 --> 51:43.910]  Jeans and flip-flops.
[51:45.070 --> 51:46.830]  Dude, I've been looking for them.
[51:46.930 --> 51:47.590]  I haven't seen any.
[51:48.950 --> 51:50.730]  That one time you called it out, I think you were right.
[51:50.730 --> 51:51.670]  But I can't.
[51:52.290 --> 51:52.670]  Sorry.
[51:54.210 --> 51:56.070]  It just wasn't close enough to see.
[51:56.210 --> 51:57.510]  This guy again with the dog, man.
[51:58.030 --> 51:59.430]  He's close to a dead paradise.
[51:59.670 --> 52:01.170]  He's really close, but not quite.
[52:01.250 --> 52:04.370]  He's not quite there. He's a little more like Surfer Fisher dude still.
[52:05.270 --> 52:07.150]  He's got a few more bad years in him.
[52:10.300 --> 52:11.580]  It's emptying out again.
[52:11.700 --> 52:12.420]  Everyone's gone.
[52:14.180 --> 52:15.400]  This is quiet.
[52:16.080 --> 52:16.900]  Gavin, what do you need?
[52:18.420 --> 52:19.440]  Yeah, what do you need, Gavin?
[52:20.780 --> 52:21.140]  Uh...
[52:21.960 --> 52:24.760]  Chug and ghost tour would get me...
[52:24.760 --> 52:25.420]  a lion.
[52:25.720 --> 52:26.860]  I have not seen a ghost tour.
[52:26.960 --> 52:28.720]  I don't think you're winning this one, bud.
[52:29.780 --> 52:31.840]  And a go-kart and spilled food.
[52:33.480 --> 52:35.960]  If I can get a cop car and a handshake, I can win.
[52:37.660 --> 52:38.660]  Handshake bandage, dude.
[52:39.340 --> 52:40.940]  Trying to get in the wrong car would get me.
[52:40.940 --> 52:42.060]  Trying to get in the wrong car would be it.
[52:42.760 --> 52:45.380]  No, it's on the line at Beachcocks, but it's not.
[52:45.480 --> 52:45.920]  It's not.
[52:45.920 --> 52:47.540]  No, it's not quite.
[52:47.820 --> 52:49.140]  It can't be. The backpack's wrong.
[52:49.580 --> 52:50.880]  Isn't that Ruby Rod?
[52:51.340 --> 52:52.120]  They don't wear shorts.
[52:57.760 --> 52:58.980]  Sloppy Joe's is crazy.
[52:59.240 --> 53:01.940]  It gets so busy and then just dies.
[53:02.140 --> 53:05.740]  Yeah, it's either there's tons of vehicles or tons of people.
[53:05.900 --> 53:06.620]  It's not simultaneous.
[53:07.640 --> 53:10.040]  It's also you get the impression that it's dead,
[53:10.180 --> 53:12.640]  but just off camera are all those people we just saw.
[53:12.960 --> 53:13.540]  That's true.
[53:13.780 --> 53:15.520]  Is it just like a million people in there?
[53:15.640 --> 53:17.320]  It's just a million people everywhere.
[53:17.320 --> 53:20.320]  And I guarantee you inside it's packed as a motherfucker.
[53:21.400 --> 53:23.180]  That guy dropped something when he picked it up.
[53:23.380 --> 53:24.240]  I saw that.
[53:25.560 --> 53:26.520]  Anyone drop anything?
[53:26.920 --> 53:28.100]  Was it food by chance?
[53:28.900 --> 53:30.120]  I don't think so.
[53:31.900 --> 53:33.100]  I don't think so.
[53:36.030 --> 53:38.690]  I can get like three or four different bingos,
[53:38.770 --> 53:40.510]  but it just requires two different cars.
[53:40.910 --> 53:41.450]  It sucks.
[53:42.470 --> 53:43.250]  I'm in the same boat.
[53:43.570 --> 53:47.110]  I can't believe there hasn't been a cop car or a fire truck or an ambulance yet.
[53:47.590 --> 53:48.190]  Everyone's behaving.
[53:48.390 --> 53:49.750]  Who's patrolling these streets?
[53:50.090 --> 53:52.470]  Fisher is saying that we can extend. We just need to know.
[53:52.750 --> 53:53.330]  Hell yeah.
[53:53.910 --> 53:55.590]  I mean, we need to extend until someone gets home.
[53:55.670 --> 53:57.390]  Are we going to go until we get a bingo, Fisher?
[53:58.190 --> 54:00.550]  Fisher, it's official. We need to extend our time. I'm sorry.
[54:00.870 --> 54:01.910]  Someone needs cake.
[54:04.510 --> 54:05.930]  Somebody's got to go home with a cake tonight.
[54:06.130 --> 54:07.270]  That they buy for themselves.
[54:09.210 --> 54:10.770]  We'll put it on Gracie's card.
[54:11.030 --> 54:12.570]  Oh, they're holding hands. Is that one?
[54:13.070 --> 54:14.650]  Where's that? No, that's a handshake.
[54:14.650 --> 54:15.670]  That's a handhug.
[54:15.790 --> 54:18.510]  A handhug?
[54:22.550 --> 54:24.070]  A pink taxi.
[54:25.510 --> 54:27.350]  Yeah, I'm still waiting on the original.
[54:28.130 --> 54:29.630]  Do they exist anymore?
[54:29.750 --> 54:30.910]  Did they paint the taxis?
[54:31.130 --> 54:32.530]  Did they get rid of the pink taxis?
[54:32.730 --> 54:33.550]  They're around.
[54:33.850 --> 54:35.430]  Are there white taxis now?
[54:35.570 --> 54:36.830]  I've seen a lot of white taxis.
[54:37.970 --> 54:39.550]  There's always a lot of white taxis.
[54:40.090 --> 54:41.910]  I don't feel like I see a lot of white taxis.
[54:41.910 --> 54:42.530]  Yeah.
[54:43.190 --> 54:46.110]  Taxi with pink lettering, that doesn't cut it.
[54:46.610 --> 54:48.410]  It's because the pink taxis exist
[54:48.410 --> 54:49.770]  and they're so starkly pink.
[54:50.990 --> 54:54.750]  I was just told the magnet is almost sold out.
[54:56.230 --> 54:57.910]  That's fucking bonkers.
[54:59.050 --> 55:00.070]  Jump on the magnet.
[55:00.430 --> 55:02.610]  If you're thinking about it, you might want to grab it
[55:02.610 --> 55:03.510]  because it's almost gone.
[55:03.850 --> 55:05.350]  How many do we have? 2000.
[55:05.850 --> 55:06.330]  No!
[55:07.870 --> 55:08.470]  What?
[55:08.470 --> 55:09.230]  Yeah.
[55:09.830 --> 55:10.270]  Really?
[55:11.110 --> 55:14.030]  The Vancouver child kicker mats are getting low also.
[55:14.670 --> 55:16.750]  We still got bingo sets, but they're going.
[55:17.130 --> 55:18.310]  So jump on all that stuff.
[55:18.470 --> 55:20.090]  But I just wanted to let you know the magnets are almost gone.
[55:20.810 --> 55:22.730]  Thanks for the heads up, Eric.
[55:23.390 --> 55:23.970]  It's Leia.
[55:24.730 --> 55:26.690]  That's formal. Look at those high heels.
[55:30.890 --> 55:31.770]  I don't...
[55:31.770 --> 55:33.150]  This is who we saw earlier
[55:33.150 --> 55:35.090]  and Emily, I think, would have said yes
[55:35.090 --> 55:36.070]  if it was formal.
[55:36.070 --> 55:37.970]  I don't think he's going to let us take it.
[55:38.150 --> 55:38.870]  Yeah, I agree.
[55:39.530 --> 55:40.410]  It's close.
[55:43.470 --> 55:46.730]  But you're not wearing that to the spring formal.
[55:48.530 --> 55:50.930]  I mean, you could wear it to a Key West wedding,
[55:51.190 --> 55:53.750]  but I think that's more of an indictment on Key West
[55:53.750 --> 55:54.690]  than it is anything else.
[55:56.410 --> 55:57.650]  Yeah, I could buy it
[55:57.650 --> 56:01.310]  if the guys weren't wearing that next to them.
[56:01.890 --> 56:03.810]  Because that dude didn't wear that t-shirt
[56:03.810 --> 56:05.090]  and shorts to the wedding.
[56:05.910 --> 56:07.530]  Unless he's a total badass.
[56:09.130 --> 56:11.530]  Fuck, you're lucky to have me.
[56:12.050 --> 56:13.130]  I wear what I wear.
[56:13.330 --> 56:15.150]  I'm John Fetterman.
[56:16.270 --> 56:17.530]  You don't tell me what to wear.
[56:19.670 --> 56:21.950]  I'll wear a fucking hoodie to this wedding in Key West.
[56:22.090 --> 56:23.190]  I don't care if it's 100 degrees.
[56:27.290 --> 56:29.230]  Yeah, maybe you guys should hug and make up.
[56:29.750 --> 56:31.050]  Are these guys arguing?
[56:31.590 --> 56:33.450]  I can't tell if they're fighting
[56:33.450 --> 56:34.250]  or play fighting.
[56:35.650 --> 56:36.850]  No, that's fighting.
[56:36.930 --> 56:38.130]  Yeah, that was a fight.
[56:38.850 --> 56:39.110]  Couple fighting.
[56:41.430 --> 56:43.310]  Now on that line, I just need someone to puke
[56:43.310 --> 56:44.210]  and I got one.
[56:44.370 --> 56:45.270]  Hug and make up.
[56:46.910 --> 56:49.370]  Dude, if you win on puke,
[56:49.450 --> 56:50.910]  that would be the coolest victory ever.
[56:53.590 --> 56:55.310]  I can't wait to watch this VOD
[56:55.310 --> 56:57.430]  back at all the jeans and flip flops
[56:57.430 --> 56:57.950]  that I've missed.
[56:59.450 --> 57:00.890]  It's an endless wave.
[57:00.890 --> 57:02.850]  It's so funny because I only
[57:02.850 --> 57:04.930]  put puking in because when I first
[57:04.930 --> 57:07.150]  started doing this, it happened so much.
[57:07.470 --> 57:09.030]  It was like, well, it's clearly a common
[57:09.030 --> 57:10.350]  occurrence, I guess I should add it.
[57:10.850 --> 57:12.570]  And then it's like, all the puke dried up,
[57:12.730 --> 57:13.290]  I feel like.
[57:14.590 --> 57:17.610]  Uh, no.
[57:21.450 --> 57:21.890]  Close.
[57:22.410 --> 57:22.910]  And so did Eric.
[57:24.630 --> 57:25.510]  Dinner scooters!
[57:27.230 --> 57:28.790]  I can't believe we haven't seen anybody
[57:28.790 --> 57:29.530]  chug yet.
[57:30.370 --> 57:32.550]  That dude's a litterbug, he just dropped a cigarette on the ground, didn't he?
[57:32.990 --> 57:34.250]  Is that that white cigarette right there?
[57:34.770 --> 57:36.430]  Did that just happen? God damn it.
[57:37.450 --> 57:37.830]  Sorry.
[57:38.530 --> 57:39.250]  I couldn't confirm.
[57:42.070 --> 57:42.450]  Motherfucker.
[57:44.330 --> 57:45.510]  God damn dickhead.
[57:45.550 --> 57:46.510]  Okay, I just got confirmation
[57:46.510 --> 57:47.910]  we are extending until we get a bingo.
[57:48.590 --> 57:49.430]  Oh, hell yeah.
[57:50.330 --> 57:52.390]  Thanks, Fisher. Thanks, Michael.
[57:53.010 --> 57:54.550]  Thank you, Fisher. Thank you, Michael.
[57:54.630 --> 57:56.210]  Thank you, everybody in broadcast.
[57:56.210 --> 57:56.970]  Yeah.
[57:57.510 --> 57:58.570]  Really appreciate it.
[57:59.770 --> 58:02.350]  That was a dickhead truck. That's on the new...
[58:02.350 --> 58:03.210]  That'll be in the updates.
[58:03.370 --> 58:04.410]  What makes a truck dickhead?
[58:05.110 --> 58:08.230]  Uh, if it's got giant tires, or if it's incredibly loud
[58:08.230 --> 58:10.230]  and it's booming from some speaker
[58:10.230 --> 58:12.250]  that's broken, or if it's got ground effects
[58:12.250 --> 58:14.730]  blasting so it looks like a neon bomb
[58:14.730 --> 58:15.450]  down the street.
[58:15.770 --> 58:18.210]  I guess a cybertruck would also be a dickhead truck.
[58:18.590 --> 58:20.070]  Yes, for sure.
[58:20.610 --> 58:21.730]  Time dicktruck, yes.
[58:23.330 --> 58:24.210]  That's like the...
[58:24.210 --> 58:26.230]  If you look up dickhead truck in the dictionary
[58:26.230 --> 58:27.110]  it's a cybertruck.
[58:27.930 --> 58:30.110]  It looks like a fancy car.
[58:30.970 --> 58:31.230]  Where?
[58:32.470 --> 58:33.170]  Ah, never mind.
[58:34.370 --> 58:35.510]  Magnets are sold out.
[58:36.070 --> 58:36.850]  Oh my god.
[58:38.050 --> 58:39.010]  Thank you so much.
[58:39.270 --> 58:40.310]  You guys are crazy.
[58:41.530 --> 58:43.410]  I'll tell you what, you guys are crazy, but
[58:43.410 --> 58:46.110]  you're crazy with an awesome kitchen magnet
[58:46.110 --> 58:48.230]  that you are going to love.
[58:48.350 --> 58:49.970]  You just added a refrigerator
[58:50.530 --> 58:51.650]  to your house.
[58:51.650 --> 58:52.970]  It is such a premium
[58:53.550 --> 58:53.950]  thing.
[58:54.730 --> 58:56.450]  You've never had a magnet this
[58:57.710 --> 58:58.510]  beautifully crafted.
[58:59.450 --> 59:01.250]  And you got it way faster than I got his.
[59:01.350 --> 59:01.930]  How's a high five?
[59:03.950 --> 59:05.030]  Does anybody have a high five?
[59:05.430 --> 59:06.550]  I don't.
[59:07.510 --> 59:09.110]  Nick's right, you get it way faster than I got mine.
[59:13.060 --> 59:15.300]  I waited 15 months so you don't have to.
[59:19.580 --> 59:21.180]  That guy's Heisman-ing his way.
[59:23.220 --> 59:25.140]  Whoa. Those are some
[59:25.820 --> 59:26.340]  heels.
[59:27.260 --> 59:27.880]  Hell yeah.
[59:30.860 --> 59:33.140]  No jeans with flip flops has been
[59:33.140 --> 59:33.580]  crazy.
[59:34.640 --> 59:35.620]  Dead parent head?
[59:35.760 --> 59:37.640]  That guy's a dead parent head right there.
[59:38.740 --> 59:39.620]  He's got it.
[59:41.480 --> 59:43.340]  The guy with the camo hat?
[59:43.800 --> 59:44.060]  Yeah.
[59:46.760 --> 59:48.360]  I need someone to y'all
[59:48.360 --> 59:48.820]  weight up.
[59:49.540 --> 59:50.920]  And then I got it.
[59:50.920 --> 59:52.020]  Cool mustache, buddy.
[59:52.700 --> 59:53.040]  Thanks.
[59:55.300 --> 59:56.800]  Okay, yeah, I just need skateboard
[59:56.800 --> 59:57.860]  and I have it.
[59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.800]  I need a lot of things. I'm fucked.
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:05.620]  I'm just having a beer.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.840]  If I get trying to get in the wrong car,
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.760]  if I get go-kart, or
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.820]  if I get someone yells weight up, then
[01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:13.700]  I got it.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.660]  Have you guys ever tried to get into the wrong Uber before?
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.400]  No. On purpose?
[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:20.280]  No, not on purpose.
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.620]  When you say try,
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.240]  it doesn't apply.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.360]  Well, like, I tried to get into the wrong Uber once
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.860]  and the guy stopped me. He's like, who the fuck are you?
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.780]  And I was like, uh, Uber? And he was like,
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:32.600]  no? And then I looked. It was like a green
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.540]  sedan. And I looked and right behind him
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:36.360]  was a green sedan. And I was like, sorry.
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.320]  So I tried to get in. There was a car seat. And I'm like,
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.540]  do I move it? And he's like, who the fuck are you?
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:42.500]  Get out of my
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:43.120]  kid's lap.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.340]  So you didn't try to get in the wrong Uber, you just
[01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:48.280]  got in a car. I got in the wrong
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.780]  car, it wasn't an Uber. Yeah, you just got in a car.
[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:52.340]  To my knowledge, he was not
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:52.600]  an Uber.
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.460]  Just a confused dad.
[01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:58.100]  Andrew, you still
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:00.260]  have confidence that you're gonna win this cake?
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.540]  No, I don't think there are any pink taxis
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:03.420]  on this planet.
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:05.600]  I think they painted them white.
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:11.360]  Like, I've seen
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.820]  50,000 taxis, not a single pink one.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.700]  Yes. What if that one, uh,
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:18.040]  what if that SUV on the left over there that's about to
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.640]  come across- Is that an electric car?
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:20.780]  No, it's a keyhole.
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.700]  Was that- no, nevermind.
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:25.780]  Nevermind.
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:27.900]  That was not a wheelchair.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.320]  I'm never
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.680]  gonna see a wheelchair, that's just dumb.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.060]  Not in this.
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:35.780]  I don't care about that.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.120]  This point is pink tax. I don't care about
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.220]  that. You'll see one when it doesn't
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:41.560]  help you in any way whatsoever.
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:44.120]  That could be from a wedding. Yeah, look,
[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:46.400]  she's carrying the- Oh, come on.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.740]  The bride's veil.
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:50.220]  That could be from a wedding.
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.440]  Once again,
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.420]  it's fucking quiet
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:01:59.940]  for a midnight on a Friday. Yeah.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:00.740]  Yeah.
[01:02:04.570 --> 01:02:06.770]  Wow, those two are waiting a long
[01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:07.890]  time to cross this street.
[01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:09.630]  They're really pondering.
[01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:11.850]  Really crosswalk cowards.
[01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:14.090]  There may have been a network disconnect
[01:02:14.090 --> 01:02:15.030]  on those people.
[01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:17.170]  They're getting rebooted right now.
[01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:17.750]  Remotely.
[01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:20.910]  Here we go. Oh my god,
[01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:21.790]  they really were waiting.
[01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:24.890]  That was crosswalk coward in a whole
[01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:25.730]  different way.
[01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:29.190]  They were just crosswalk squares.
[01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:31.010]  I think that's gotta count
[01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:32.870]  for crosswalk coward.
[01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:34.830]  But yeah, it's like, I never envisioned it
[01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:36.550]  being picked up that way.
[01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:38.450]  I'd get his guns out.
[01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:40.970]  How are none of these guys in jeans and flip-flops?
[01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:42.590]  Like, look at these guys.
[01:02:42.590 --> 01:02:43.710]  None of them?
[01:02:44.290 --> 01:02:46.110]  That's clearly a golfing team.
[01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:48.470]  Jeans and flip-flops were designed
[01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:49.750]  for these guys. Nice belt.
[01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:52.350]  Dear lord, he tucked it in.
[01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:54.570]  There is not much
[01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:56.350]  worse on this earth than a belt
[01:02:56.350 --> 01:02:57.990]  with shorts and a tuck-in.
[01:02:58.890 --> 01:02:59.090]  Yeah.
[01:02:59.930 --> 01:03:02.710]  There's something about a polo shirt with shorts
[01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:03.430]  that is
[01:03:04.310 --> 01:03:05.550]  absurd to me.
[01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:08.490]  I find it to be
[01:03:08.490 --> 01:03:09.270]  slightly offensive.
[01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:10.830]  Yeah, it's just like,
[01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:12.170]  I just don't get it.
[01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:15.010]  Not tucked in. You can do it otherwise, maybe.
[01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:17.330]  You can do it sloppy style a little bit.
[01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:18.970]  I think you can do it if you're golfing
[01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:20.890]  and that's it. And then if you're going somewhere,
[01:03:21.010 --> 01:03:21.730]  you better change.
[01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:24.310]  Okay, sweet. I feel better now.
[01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:25.730]  Okay, sweet.
[01:03:26.610 --> 01:03:28.410]  Nick looks over at his closet and it's all
[01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:30.770]  fucking shorts and he starts sweating.
[01:03:33.970 --> 01:03:34.370]  Fellas!
[01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:36.010]  Right, guys?
[01:03:38.290 --> 01:03:38.930]  All right.
[01:03:39.070 --> 01:03:40.850]  Bouncer bouncing, litterbug,
[01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:42.790]  offensive t-shirt, chug, bandage dude,
[01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:44.610]  handshake. Some of these are classics.
[01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:46.710]  It's just not happening. He said it again,
[01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:48.790]  right? Yeah. Did I say
[01:03:48.790 --> 01:03:50.530]  offensive t-shirt? No, you said
[01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:51.690]  offensive t-shirt.
[01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:54.790]  I'm pretty sure I said offensive t-shirt. Yeah, I just said it again.
[01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:56.770]  Hey, go back and listen to this bot.
[01:03:56.890 --> 01:03:58.690]  No, you didn't. I don't like to live in the past, dude.
[01:03:58.690 --> 01:03:59.770]  I'm trying to move forward with my life.
[01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:02.790]  She's fucking hoofing,
[01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:04.770]  but I think we already had it. We did, yeah.
[01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:06.690]  But she was definitely hoofing.
[01:04:07.090 --> 01:04:08.790]  Everyone has had shoes on tonight.
[01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:12.330]  Is that a luxury car?
[01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:20.550]  Can that be a luxury car?
[01:04:23.310 --> 01:04:26.090]  It has a real cool back window.
[01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:28.270]  I really want Andrew to win
[01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:30.410]  tonight. Is that a
[01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:31.590]  luxury car?
[01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:34.310]  Andrew's in the best
[01:04:34.310 --> 01:04:36.430]  time zone. Yeah, right?
[01:04:36.550 --> 01:04:38.490]  I'm just beaten down by these luxury
[01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:40.190]  cars, Gavin, and the pink taxi.
[01:04:40.570 --> 01:04:42.490]  It's not about energy. I'm a broken man
[01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:44.310]  at the moment. You still have your whole night
[01:04:44.310 --> 01:04:44.810]  ahead of you.
[01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:48.090]  How's your phone situation going, Andrew?
[01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:50.290]  I don't have one, so it's
[01:04:50.290 --> 01:04:52.130]  the same. Same, okay.
[01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:54.070]  There's our
[01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:55.590]  parrot head friend again. Yeah, no kidding.
[01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:58.410]  He is. He even walks
[01:04:58.410 --> 01:05:00.230]  kind of parrot-y. Yes, yeah.
[01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.790]  Ah!
[01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:04.430]  He's known to make that noise
[01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:05.510]  as well. Yeah.
[01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:07.390]  He's just chasing that guy.
[01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:09.890]  Oh, he's still with that dude.
[01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:11.970]  You'll never get away. Is that Jesus
[01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:13.690]  in flip-flops? Where?
[01:05:14.590 --> 01:05:15.730]  Where? Right there.
[01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:17.770]  Crossing the street.
[01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:20.530]  That woman. No, she's wearing shoes.
[01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.250]  No, those are sandals, but
[01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:23.070]  I don't think they're flip-flops. Damn it.
[01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:25.330]  Why did you call that lady Jesus?
[01:05:25.890 --> 01:05:28.290]  Oh, you said jeans in flip-flops. It sounded like you said Jesus.
[01:05:28.290 --> 01:05:30.530]  You thought her name was Jesus
[01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:31.870]  flip-flops? Yeah.
[01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:34.330]  You heard the same thing here? Yeah,
[01:05:34.350 --> 01:05:34.790]  absolutely.
[01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:38.050]  It also doesn't help, Gavin, if someone says
[01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:39.830]  where, you yelling there is not
[01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:40.990]  useless.
[01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:44.030]  I'm pointing.
[01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:45.670]  Thanks.
[01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:46.570]  Fair enough.
[01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:50.510]  Oh my
[01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:52.090]  God. I'm just that
[01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:53.790]  Leonardo DiCaprio gif all night.
[01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:56.310]  What if you threw up on the ground right now,
[01:05:56.310 --> 01:05:56.490]  buddy?
[01:05:57.170 --> 01:05:58.430]  What if what?
[01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:02.370]  Obviously, I don't want this. What if one of
[01:06:02.370 --> 01:06:04.250]  the security guards gets hit by a taxi
[01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:06.190]  that's wearing pink? Is that
[01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:07.990]  then a pink taxi? You know what?
[01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:10.310]  If that happens, Andrew, I'll give it to
[01:06:10.310 --> 01:06:12.310]  you. That's a FaceTime
[01:06:12.310 --> 01:06:14.250]  screen. Oh, this ice cream cake
[01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:16.330]  is coming. Is that a FaceTime screen? I'm pretty sure
[01:06:16.330 --> 01:06:17.290]  that's a FaceTime screen there.
[01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:19.310]  Okay.
[01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:21.850]  I'll undo it.
[01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:22.350]  Is that a kid?
[01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:23.610]  Is that a kid out late?
[01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:25.530]  That's a little kid out late.
[01:06:25.850 --> 01:06:28.130]  Look at that little fucker. That's a little kid out late.
[01:06:28.270 --> 01:06:29.510]  Oh, that is a kid out late.
[01:06:30.050 --> 01:06:32.210]  That's a bouncer bouncing. Look, he's spinning people.
[01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:34.350]  Everyone needs to get
[01:06:34.350 --> 01:06:35.270]  rotated occasionally.
[01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:36.810]  Was that Litterbug?
[01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:39.250]  That was in the street.
[01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:40.630]  It's drifting.
[01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:43.890]  What if the wind blows it into the bin?
[01:06:46.350 --> 01:06:48.490]  I got that, but it doesn't help me in any way.
[01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.690]  High five.
[01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:50.870]  Did anyone have high five?
[01:06:51.350 --> 01:06:52.470]  Oh, don't hit the bag!
[01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:57.290]  Is that guy choking that lady for a second?
[01:06:57.610 --> 01:06:58.870]  I don't know. What was that?
[01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:01.890]  Are we watching American Beauty right now?
[01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:03.170]  God damn it!
[01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:07.730]  American Beauty should be on there.
[01:07:10.030 --> 01:07:11.450]  Just a bag in the wind.
[01:07:13.350 --> 01:07:15.410]  That's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
[01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:17.670]  And boy, that guy
[01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:19.590]  drowned an interstellar.
[01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:20.790]  Oh, yeah.
[01:07:21.690 --> 01:07:22.130]  No.
[01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:27.250]  Did he drown in a bag?
[01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:28.790]  No, no.
[01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:31.770]  Oh, it was completely
[01:07:31.770 --> 01:07:33.470]  unrelated to a bag drowning?
[01:07:34.110 --> 01:07:35.030]  Yeah, just water.
[01:07:35.490 --> 01:07:37.550]  They probably had bags on the spaceship, but it was mainly
[01:07:37.550 --> 01:07:38.330]  just on the water.
[01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:41.710]  How long were they
[01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:43.590]  stuck on that planet? Because that's how long
[01:07:43.590 --> 01:07:45.270]  we're probably going to take to find a bingo.
[01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:45.370]  I don't know.
[01:07:46.290 --> 01:07:48.310]  Give me a go-kart and we're done!
[01:07:48.570 --> 01:07:50.070]  I think it was like two hours for them,
[01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:53.710]  but like 28 years for everyone else.
[01:07:57.930 --> 01:07:59.430]  So someone else weighed up
[01:07:59.430 --> 01:08:00.130]  and we're done?
[01:08:01.290 --> 01:08:03.590]  Dude, we should add in long shorts.
[01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:04.770]  Oh, yeah.
[01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:07.110]  Long shorts is a good one.
[01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:08.830]  God, ankle shorts.
[01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:10.650]  Conflicted shorts.
[01:08:12.030 --> 01:08:13.070]  Conflicted shorts.
[01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:19.430]  Andrew, none of these are pink.
[01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:21.590]  None of them are luxury either.
[01:08:24.010 --> 01:08:26.010]  Those guys took a photo.
[01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:29.390]  We already did that.
[01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:33.230]  These guys are...
[01:08:33.230 --> 01:08:34.870]  That's guy next to guy scooter.
[01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:36.910]  Yeah, that's guy near guy scooter.
[01:08:38.110 --> 01:08:38.850]  Bad boys.
[01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:40.490]  They both had coolers.
[01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:43.150]  That guy is struggling, pushing...
[01:08:43.150 --> 01:08:44.170]  Come on, buddy, you got it.
[01:08:44.170 --> 01:08:45.990]  He's having to push his knee
[01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.590]  with his hand.
[01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:49.950]  It's hard to ride a bicycle
[01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:50.590]  when you're drunk.
[01:08:51.370 --> 01:08:52.670]  Take your shoes off!
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:57.980]  I really thought
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:08:59.960]  the go-go-now guy would loop back around.
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.040]  That's how you know it had
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.060]  nothing to do with this.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.140]  He had no idea.
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:08.060]  He's going to find out
[01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.520]  later all of his friends are going to make fun of him.
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:10.100]  It's going to be awesome.
[01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:12.340]  If that dude literally just
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:14.560]  randomly showed up
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.220]  and was like, oh, since I'm here, I'll go say hi
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:18.620]  in front of the thing and had no idea that the entire
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:19.980]  staff was watching him.
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:22.580]  That's pretty fucking funny.
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:23.800]  Say wait up!
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:26.120]  She was pretty formal.
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.440]  She had a purse.
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.220]  That's the purse of this guy
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:34.940]  and girl scooter.
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:38.240]  That bag is
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.060]  still there.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:44.440]  Do you think that bag will still be there
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:44.860]  when we're done?
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:48.180]  I don't think that bag is ever moving.
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:50.220]  I think that bag is just there now.
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:51.300]  It's like when somebody
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.060]  got drunk and lost their keys in that grate
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:55.860]  and they had to pick up the grate and move it
[01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:57.960]  and they couldn't put it back and the grate was
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.300]  off for like three weeks.
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:02.000]  Until it finally got fixed.
[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:03.220]  Secret.
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:06.300]  Oh, wait.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:08.580]  Going in for a hug
[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:08.880]  or something?
[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:10.860]  Handshake?
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:13.120]  My mother says we missed Guy on Guy's
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:13.720]  scooter twice.
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:17.180]  I'm blind as dicks.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:17.760]  Is this a hug?
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.120]  We can't mark it.
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:22.800]  That's a handshake right there.
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:24.440]  That's a handshake.
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.300]  I just need cop car and I'll win.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.240]  That's half a hug.
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:30.080]  That's a hug.
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:32.080]  No, that's a whisper.
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.280]  That's a secret whisper.
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.180]  That's a handshake.
[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:35.960]  Kiss.
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:38.000]  That's a back pat.
[01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:40.040]  They did everything except hug.
[01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:42.260]  See if he hugs that.
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:42.760]  Nope.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.720]  You son of a bitch.
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:49.560]  While we were watching that, I'm sure a pink taxi
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.480]  wearing jeans
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:52.580]  and sandals
[01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:55.140]  littering everywhere drove by.
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:57.080]  So it's down to
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.360]  pink taxi, luxury car,
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.160]  cop car, skateboard,
[01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:03.240]  any of those, somebody wins.
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:04.900]  Trying to get in the wrong car?
[01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:06.760]  Go cart? Someone yells, wait up.
[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:08.380]  I need one of those.
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:11.500]  I have two on every single spot.
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.000]  I just need two in multiple places.
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:15.260]  I also need
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:17.020]  can see FaceTime screen.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.440]  So if you're in
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.240]  Key West, head on down and get a FaceTime
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:22.680]  screen going and show it to the camera.
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.020]  My right column is completely empty.
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:26.640]  Laughing.
[01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:33.180]  Whoa.
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:33.880]  Whoa.
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:37.900]  Is that jeans and flip flops?
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:38.760]  That's a fucking hug.
[01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:40.080]  That's a hug.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:43.620]  Yeah. There's jeans and flip flops to the woman at the top.
[01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:45.020]  Yeah, that was jeans and flip flops.
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:45.620]  Oh shit.
[01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:48.240]  And I'm taking the hug too from there.
[01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:50.060]  The hug absolutely happened.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.420]  That was a double whammy.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:54.780]  Things are happening.
[01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:56.760]  See, it's
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:57.440]  picking up again.
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.960]  This is a dickhead truck.
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:01.160]  It lifted.
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:02.480]  Big time.
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:05.660]  Got the windows all murdered out.
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:06.400]  Another taxi.
[01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:09.000]  Laughing.
[01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:12.020]  Andrew on Taxi Watch 2023.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.780]  Just knock it out of his hand. Fuck him. Do it.
[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:20.440]  Oh man, it's
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:21.480]  really getting down.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.400]  What is that?
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.780]  Is that not a luxury car?
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:27.140]  Look at the back window of that car.
[01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:28.200]  That's not a luxury car.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.000]  Look at the back window.
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:35.600]  Does puke count as spilled food?
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:38.140]  Interesting.
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:39.900]  Yeah, I think it would.
[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:42.160]  That's a double play.
[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:44.480]  That's a twofer.
[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:48.720]  Puke doesn't necessarily count as food.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.180]  It could be bile.
[01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:52.340]  Depends on the contents.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.400]  Bile is food.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.300]  Oh god.
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.960]  I mean, it can
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:01.120]  only be the stuff
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.340]  you...
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:05.080]  Drop it.
[01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:06.740]  No, that wasn't Beechcoff.
[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:11.010]  This is such
[01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:11.990]  a tidy night.
[01:13:12.610 --> 01:13:14.310]  The love of god.
[01:13:14.530 --> 01:13:16.170]  Just a single pink taxi.
[01:13:16.710 --> 01:13:17.910]  Maybe they let
[01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:20.950]  everybody at the airport
[01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:22.030]  know when they came in this weekend.
[01:13:22.170 --> 01:13:24.430]  Listen, this is a respectful weekend in Key West.
[01:13:24.710 --> 01:13:26.930]  Mind your P's and Q's. We're not putting up with the bullshit.
[01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:29.010]  That guy on the bike had a beer
[01:13:29.010 --> 01:13:29.550]  in his hand.
[01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:32.850]  That was the fattest tired trike
[01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:33.530]  I've ever seen.
[01:13:35.530 --> 01:13:36.830]  It was pretty fat tired.
[01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:40.770]  All these got shoes on.
[01:13:42.370 --> 01:13:43.170]  Nobody's chugging.
[01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:44.690]  Where are your drinks?
[01:13:44.970 --> 01:13:45.930]  Law enforcement.
[01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:47.350]  Nobody's tripping.
[01:13:53.370 --> 01:13:54.050]  That's a
[01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:56.070]  white...
[01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:58.350]  Yeah, that's a white taxi, Andrew.
[01:13:59.070 --> 01:14:00.570]  I've seen 20,000
[01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:00.910]  of those.
[01:14:03.450 --> 01:14:04.970]  I'm like two minutes away
[01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:06.230]  from calling a pink taxi
[01:14:06.230 --> 01:14:07.210]  to stop Jess.
[01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:12.490]  Brilliant.
[01:14:13.930 --> 01:14:14.490]  What?
[01:14:14.730 --> 01:14:15.690]  No, that's just...
[01:14:15.690 --> 01:14:17.330]  It's just the lighting.
[01:14:17.330 --> 01:14:19.250]  It's a brake light
[01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:19.850]  white taxi.
[01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:23.290]  Drop your drink,
[01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:24.290]  asshat.
[01:14:24.610 --> 01:14:27.270]  This is by far the longest it's ever taken us
[01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:28.250]  to get a bingo.
[01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:31.530]  It used to be good in the first 15 minutes.
[01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:33.250]  Yeah, sometimes we get close
[01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:34.930]  to blacking out a fucking bingo board.
[01:14:37.530 --> 01:14:39.030]  I'm worried about the cards
[01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:41.250]  not being wipeable. We're gonna die by the time
[01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:42.550]  one of us gets a single finger.
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:48.680]  Get your sloppy
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:49.900]  bingo box now.
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:52.240]  If you get...
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:53.300]  Think about this.
[01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:55.720]  Andrew, your card
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:56.880]  is from this box.
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:58.700]  So someone could be playing
[01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:01.240]  after they buy this box. They could be playing with your card
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:02.920]  and then you get pink taxi right away.
[01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:04.880]  I don't know what...
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.680]  Is that supposed to make me feel good?
[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:13.100]  Andrew, can I ask you a question?
[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:14.020]  Yeah.
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:15.560]  Did it make you feel good?
[01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:18.080]  No, it really didn't.
[01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:19.620]  Look, she's drunk. Drop it.
[01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:20.460]  Fanny pack!
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:23.280]  Oh yeah, is fanny pack one?
[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:26.040]  No. I don't think so, but you know what?
[01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:27.300]  It will be. We'll add that in.
[01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:29.940]  Is that guy barefoot?
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:31.360]  No, that's Jameson.
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:33.460]  Those are fucking Crocs.
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:37.080]  It, like, looks so skin-colored
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.340]  to me, I fucking flipped.
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.400]  Yeah, it's creepy.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.680]  But he would have, like, weird little elf feet
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:43.600]  if those were his real feet.
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:48.660]  Be careful crossing the road, hold hands.
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:50.340]  Oh, so many taxis
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:51.660]  and none of them are pink.
[01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:54.040]  You know what's interesting, too?
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:56.620]  I don't know if you guys have been slopping lately,
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:58.620]  but nobody
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.460]  seems to acknowledge
[01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:01.540]  the camera anymore.
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:04.700]  And it was happening almost too much
[01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:05.360]  back in the day.
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:08.120]  The only one who's really done it tonight is the go-go now.
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:09.500]  Yeah? Yep.
[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:12.500]  I need, like, I need a camera shy
[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:13.980]  and I haven't seen... oh, there's another
[01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:16.300]  that is absolutely a dead parrot head
[01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:17.960]  right there. He's like, no, after you, sir.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.960]  Oh, is that a luxury car? And he's like,
[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:21.800]  my smell precedes me. That one?
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:24.140]  There you go. Got himself a free drink off the ground.
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:25.900]  That's a cool
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:26.700]  fin.
[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:30.160]  It's just a fucking
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:31.520]  region, man.
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:34.160]  Can I check some of mine?
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:35.980]  Have we had somebody else to weigh up?
[01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:37.220]  No, I need that one.
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:38.620]  No.
[01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:43.980]  No, that's just a tattooed lady.
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:45.920]  Have we had
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:46.900]  Olmec get hit by a car?
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:48.360]  No, I need that one.
[01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:50.760]  No, we haven't.
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:52.900]  No, I don't think so.
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.540]  We saw it happen right before we started.
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:57.400]  We don't have it yet.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:16:59.760]  Come on,
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:00.380]  drop your drink.
[01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:04.360]  What else, Gavin?
[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:08.940]  Um...
[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:09.320]  Formula tyres?
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:10.360]  No, me more.
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:13.560]  Pink taxi?
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:14.860]  Yeah.
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.620]  Tell me about it.
[01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:18.120]  We're all waiting for that one.
[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:19.960]  Is this woman okay?
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:22.360]  She needs air across her face.
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:26.220]  It gets hot under all those tattoos.
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:27.640]  People don't know that.
[01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:28.340]  Yeah.
[01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:32.950]  And traps heat.
[01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:35.050]  Yeah, it doesn't matter how hot it is outside,
[01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:35.910]  you can't take them off.
[01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:37.970]  That's a great point.
[01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:40.330]  Get another drink, then drop it.
[01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:42.290]  This guy's definitely drunk-walking.
[01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:44.390]  Oh, yeah.
[01:17:46.770 --> 01:17:48.130]  He works at Domino's.
[01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:50.730]  He might be drunk-delivering.
[01:17:51.170 --> 01:17:51.670]  I didn't realize.
[01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:53.190]  He's trying to figure out where he works.
[01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:56.370]  Can you point me to the shop?
[01:17:57.930 --> 01:17:58.770]  Hey, Andrew, we got a
[01:17:58.770 --> 01:17:59.770]  break late taxi.
[01:17:59.770 --> 01:18:01.050]  Taxi count got up.
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:11.080]  It's pretty fucking funny
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:12.400]  that there's been no pink taxi.
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.460]  Yeah, Andrew, it's pretty funny.
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:15.900]  It's hilarious.
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:17.300]  Maybe this one's pink.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.720]  No, it's not. We can see, Geoff, it's not pink.
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:22.900]  It's got pink on it.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:24.860]  There's a post on the subreddit
[01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:26.460]  by Anal Keyboard that says
[01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:28.420]  Cadillac Escalade is a luxury car.
[01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:30.240]  I don't know if I agree with that.
[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:32.100]  Yeah.
[01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:32.340]  Yeah.
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:35.520]  I don't see it, and I go,
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:36.320]  that's a luxury car.
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:37.360]  Yeah.
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:40.840]  Alright, bye.
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:41.980]  Bye-bye.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:44.720]  Okay, bye.
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:45.500]  Bye.
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:50.340]  Is this guy trying his luck right now?
[01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:55.090]  She thought that was funny.
[01:18:55.210 --> 01:18:56.330]  Do you want a sip of this?
[01:18:57.710 --> 01:18:58.730]  Is she from a wedding?
[01:18:59.630 --> 01:18:59.870]  I think.
[01:19:01.290 --> 01:19:02.190]  It's hard to tell.
[01:19:02.190 --> 01:19:03.490]  It happened for the love of God.
[01:19:08.350 --> 01:19:10.090]  Oh, Andrew, what color
[01:19:10.090 --> 01:19:11.650]  is that taxi back there? You can't tell.
[01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:12.530]  It's white.
[01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:15.910]  It looks pink.
[01:19:16.050 --> 01:19:16.910]  It has a pinkish hue.
[01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:20.330]  When was the last time a pink taxi was seen?
[01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:22.570]  I feel like this is under protest.
[01:19:23.290 --> 01:19:23.650]  I don't know.
[01:19:23.670 --> 01:19:24.990]  I'm just trying to get your hopes up.
[01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:30.190]  That lady was sitting down on the ground
[01:19:30.190 --> 01:19:32.330]  over there. Does anybody have sitting down on the ground?
[01:19:32.710 --> 01:19:34.270]  She just threw some
[01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:36.410]  trash away in the top right
[01:19:36.410 --> 01:19:37.750]  and now she's walking back.
[01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:40.230]  I think it's a she, a lady.
[01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:42.350]  But anyway, that person was sitting on the ground
[01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:44.310]  and then they...
[01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:44.370]  Huh.
[01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:47.830]  I don't think I have that now.
[01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:52.280]  Oh my God, please.
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:54.660]  How are we all this fucking close?
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:55.920]  I don't know.
[01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:57.200]  It's insane.
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:58.980]  Zero of them are pink.
[01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:00.740]  Dude, that's the thing about
[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:02.820]  Sloppy Joe's bingo. You just never know.
[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:04.820]  Some nights it's over in a flash.
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:06.920]  Some nights, everybody's hanging on
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.200]  for one last skateboard.
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:11.040]  So what are we all waiting for?
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:13.020]  It's very obvious what I need.
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:13.980]  Go-kart,
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:15.920]  someone yells to wait up,
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:17.720]  trying to get in the wrong car,
[01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:20.200]  or can see FaceTime screen.
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:23.060]  Now will any of those get you
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:24.960]  a bingo? Any of those will get me a bingo.
[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:25.940]  Damn.
[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:27.880]  I need a beautiful pink taxi
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:29.980]  for a bingo. Cop car or
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:31.940]  skateboard gets me a bingo. I don't want to share
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:32.960]  my bingo with you.
[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:35.520]  You guys will both get half a cake.
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:37.040]  Oh yeah.
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.800]  Now, how does that work? Do you have to
[01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:41.560]  agree on the cake?
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:43.680]  Yeah, you'd have to. Or do you guys just
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.400]  both get to buy half of a cake?
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:47.200]  Spaghetti cake thing.
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:48.860]  I'll take a call on the caterpillar.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.820]  Oh, I still want to try that.
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:53.840]  It's not your cake.
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.920]  I'm not pulling for a luxury car.
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:57.520]  It could be.
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:20:59.200]  What was that, Andrew?
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:01.440]  I'm not pulling for a luxury car.
[01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:03.520]  I want to deal with this British cake.
[01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:05.060]  Oh, no.
[01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:07.480]  I'm pulling for puke so you can
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:08.880]  keep pink taxi.
[01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:10.800]  I'm pulling for cop car.
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.360]  I just need dropped or spilled food and drink.
[01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:15.040]  What kind of car is this?
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:17.940]  Nissan or Toyota?
[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:18.960]  Never mind.
[01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:20.380]  Got a cool thing on the top.
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.380]  So do cabs.
[01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:30.080]  Just drop your pizza.
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:30.920]  Drop your pizza.
[01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:34.240]  Ah, you son of a...
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:35.560]  He seemed like maybe he would.
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:37.620]  Yeah, he was flopping it all around.
[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:39.300]  He did look like a pizza dropper.
[01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:41.540]  Yeah, he didn't look like a dude who respects pizza.
[01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:42.340]  No.
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:44.000]  What a monster.
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:46.560]  There's a dead pear ahead.
[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:48.760]  He's going in the trash can.
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:50.140]  What?
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.220]  He's going home.
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:56.400]  Sometimes there's good stuff in the trash can. They'll grab it.
[01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:00.660]  What's the best find you've ever had
[01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:01.480]  from a trash can?
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:03.980]  I don't think I've ever gotten anything good out of a trash can.
[01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:05.560]  Dude, I can answer that question, actually.
[01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:09.080]  When I was in high school
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:10.440]  and I worked as a tool repairman,
[01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:12.820]  my boss, he owned
[01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:15.080]  this essentially one and a half person
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:16.380]  tool repair company.
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:17.260]  I was the half person.
[01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:20.680]  He would go dumpster dive
[01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:22.080]  on the weekends
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.240]  at construction sites
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:26.280]  and, I don't know,
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.700]  paper mills and shit.
[01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:30.280]  One day he came home
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:31.560]  and he had
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:34.080]  I shit you not,
[01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:35.740]  maybe 10,000
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:38.140]  C cell and AA batteries.
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:40.100]  They were just dumped into
[01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:41.820]  a dumpster.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.900]  He goes, they're probably bad, but
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:45.740]  you're gonna find out. And then there was just
[01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:47.360]  a day where I tested batteries.
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:48.980]  You're gonna find out.
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:50.680]  Were any of them good?
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:52.240]  They were almost all good.
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:55.400]  I don't know why they were there, but yeah.
[01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:57.660]  And it was used as C cell batteries. Who the fuck uses
[01:22:57.660 --> 01:22:59.760]  C cell batteries? Like certain toys.
[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:00.600]  But that's about it.
[01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:02.060]  My cat bowl uses it.
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:04.780]  Oh, mind us too.
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:06.180]  I could've set you up for life.
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:08.860]  These guys are getting dropped off.
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:11.680]  He's got a marshmallow shirt on, it looks like.
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:13.860]  Yeah, does anyone have a marshmallow shirt?
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:15.460]  And some Air Jordan shorts.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:17.680]  I have
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:18.820]  pink marshmallow shirt.
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:23.720]  She's wearing a pink shirt.
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.000]  Pink Nirvana shirt, I believe.
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:26.620]  Yeah.
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:28.720]  That dude's wearing orange and blue.
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:30.540]  That's a loud combination.
[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:31.820]  Wow, Broncos.
[01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:35.820]  I'm sure
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:36.520]  that's what he was thinking.
[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:37.580]  That kid's out too late.
[01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:39.460]  Oh,
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:41.840]  Domino's guy's still here.
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:43.600]  He's wondering where his pizzas went.
[01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:45.440]  We've seen them go in two different directions.
[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:47.040]  There was a tag on his hat.
[01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:48.620]  Did he just buy that?
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:51.320]  He could've.
[01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:53.600]  The gift shop is right underneath the camera.
[01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:54.080]  Right, Geoff?
[01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:57.120]  Yeah, it is. It's right where the camera is.
[01:23:57.740 --> 01:23:59.680]  Like this lady, if she took a left
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:00.600]  right now, she'd walk into it.
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:02.600]  There he is again.
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:05.420]  He's like, I swear to God, there was a
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:07.380]  Domino's. I'm wearing the clothes.
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:09.040]  I work here. And this guy's like, nah,
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:11.180]  dude, this has always been a Sloppy Joe's.
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:12.160]  I promise you.
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:14.000]  I want to see this bouncer bounce him.
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:17.180]  He's like, I pulled a pizza from here earlier today.
[01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:19.500]  There's not a lot
[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:21.040]  of chains on Duval Street.
[01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:22.560]  There's, I think, a Wendy's.
[01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:25.220]  And I guess a
[01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:26.740]  Domino's because he exists.
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:28.960]  That's about it.
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:31.280]  This is the fucking 18th time this car
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:31.840]  is driven by.
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:32.280]  Yep.
[01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:38.090]  I wonder if pink taxis just don't
[01:24:38.090 --> 01:24:39.290]  work on Friday.
[01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:41.010]  They definitely do.
[01:24:41.170 --> 01:24:42.410]  We never slopped on a Friday?
[01:24:43.770 --> 01:24:45.550]  I think we only slopped on Fridays.
[01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:47.310]  Yeah, I slop on most Fridays.
[01:24:48.490 --> 01:24:48.930]  Huh.
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:54.020]  Man, it'd be cool if we got a cop car.
[01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:55.760]  It would be cool if anyone got a bingo.
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:59.880]  This is the dark side of sloppy
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:01.020]  bingo when it won't end.
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.880]  I can't believe it. It's unreal.
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:05.780]  What's the longest you've bingoed?
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:07.540]  I mean,
[01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:08.940]  I've
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:11.980]  bingoed for hours, but the longest it's
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:13.440]  taken me to fill a bingo card?
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:16.000]  I don't know. Not even close to this long.
[01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:17.540]  Wow. Half hour maybe?
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:19.860]  Wow, really? Yeah, maybe.
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:21.960]  I mean, all
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:23.820]  the bingo selections are so heavily vetted
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:24.440]  and
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:27.200]  I've made sure that they happen
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:29.960]  often enough to leave
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:31.640]  them on. It's just, we're having an
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:33.120]  incredible amount of bad luck tonight.
[01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:33.800]  Huh.
[01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:36.820]  Oh,
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:38.760]  bad luck.
[01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:41.480]  That's a dangerous move. That was crazy.
[01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:43.100]  Yeah, he didn't give a fuck.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.280]  That pizza guy's back.
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:47.660]  He's gonna get in a fight
[01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:48.420]  with the Dominus guy.
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:51.560]  Dude, why are you eating that fucking pizza when there's a
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:53.040]  chili dog right there?
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:54.860]  Yeah, slap that shit out of his hand.
[01:25:56.780 --> 01:25:57.440]  I know that
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.440]  pizza box, though. Looks
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:25:59.760]  good.
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:03.240]  Dude, I had some Papa John's
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.120]  garlic crust pizza
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.420]  today that Emily ordered.
[01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:08.400]  Jesus Christ.
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.280]  Good shit? Yeah.
[01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:13.100]  I didn't know Papa John's could be that good.
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:15.220]  I'm pretty on the fence about Papa John's.
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:17.460]  But that was fucking wonderful.
[01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:18.920]  Dog!
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:20.960]  Another dog.
[01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:23.520]  That's the dog that was wanting to play with the other dog
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:25.420]  earlier. Where are the offensive t-shirts?
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:29.880]  I bet you the pink cab driver
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:30.580]  is wearing one.
[01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:34.300]  And he's throwing up, too.
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.700]  He's not out because he spilled something on himself.
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:39.080]  Too busy
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.060]  sucking down a chili dog off-frame.
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:43.340]  He was probably sucking on a chili dog,
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:45.580]  wasn't paying attention, hit a kid on a skateboard.
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:46.460]  Oh, no.
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:49.240]  Cops had to come, ambulance was over there.
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:51.400]  Trip!
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:53.580]  He's double fisting.
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:57.600]  That's a meme.
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:58.320]  That's a meme.
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:26:59.180]  I'll give you that.
[01:26:59.420 --> 01:26:59.560]  Where?
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:01.840]  That meme.
[01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:06.080]  The lady who I want to help cross the street here in a second.
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:07.660]  That's no meme.
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:10.360]  Dude, that is a definite meme.
[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:11.860]  Let's see how she crosses the street.
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:13.000]  Yeah, let's watch her walk.
[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:15.560]  Maybe incompetently, but...
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:16.780]  Now I need go-kart.
[01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:19.540]  And I'm missing go-kart from a bingo.
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.720]  I don't think I've ever seen go-kart.
[01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:25.000]  Go-kart used to happen all the time.
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:25.540]  Flake!
[01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:26.860]  What?
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:29.960]  We got litterbug, right?
[01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:31.960]  No.
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:35.660]  I tried to get it, I saw a lady drop a cigarette.
[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:36.420]  Nobody believed me.
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:39.240]  I need litterbug now too.
[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:40.500]  Nobody believed me.
[01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:43.500]  I was telling the truth.
[01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:44.640]  Nobody would listen.
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:47.810]  Look, that's jeans and sandals.
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:50.320]  Yeah, that's fucking gross.
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:51.040]  Oh my god.
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:54.000]  Dropped something.
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:55.420]  Oh, what was that?
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:57.060]  Were you looking at the car?
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:59.940]  I had a spoiler, so I wasn't...
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:01.380]  Was that a luxury car?
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:02.320]  I don't know.
[01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:04.980]  I don't know if I would call it luxury.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:06.800]  Sorry.
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:09.800]  It was definitely souped up, but I don't know if it was luxury.
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:10.560]  Yeah.
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:13.080]  Not enough to go on.
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:16.100]  How do you guys feel about soup?
[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:17.600]  I'm against it.
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.100]  I hate soup.
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:20.680]  It's got to be cold.
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:24.340]  I like it when it doesn't go on the tip of my penis.
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:33.580]  I love that we do these live events and we spend 60% of the time making jokes to episodes that haven't come out yet.
[01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:34.860]  Yeah, they have not come out yet.
[01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:35.860]  Was that even in an episode?
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:38.620]  No, no, it's not.
[01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:40.880]  It's in a fuckface-off, I think.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:42.180]  Yeah, it's a fuckface-off.
[01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:44.200]  It's just leading up to it.
[01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:47.260]  But it gets referenced in the fuckface-off.
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:55.960]  It's a joke that the audience will never hear the beginning of, but they will hear it referenced for the next 20 years.
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:56.900]  Reset it!
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:28:58.280]  I'll just get the punchline.
[01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:01.120]  Wait, is there anything on this screen we can capture?
[01:29:01.540 --> 01:29:02.820]  Anything we can take!
[01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:05.740]  Go back!
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:14.280]  It's fucking wild that there hasn't been any kind of a public services vehicle go by.
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:16.500]  Oh, I accidentally knocked that drink out of her hand.
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:17.000]  Come on.
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:19.820]  Accidentally chug it.
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:21.280]  It's fun to litter.
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:24.280]  Accidentally chug.
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.580]  Oh, that's an open shirt.
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:28.040]  Oh, yeah, big time.
[01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:30.680]  Oh, you know, open shirt, we were talking about adding in.
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:32.940]  Hey, there's a dude with your fat tires.
[01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:36.400]  Oh, yeah, fat trike.
[01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:40.920]  Hey, Andrew, it looks like there's a cab over there about to turn in.
[01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:41.200]  Oh, hit the car.
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:43.560]  I'm giving up on pink necklace.
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:44.340]  That was...
[01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:46.900]  He was still in it!
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:51.800]  Was he trying to draw the outline of that car?
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:52.640]  What?
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:55.680]  Put your fucking clothes on, meathead.
[01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:57.060]  That's disgusting.
[01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:00.020]  You're still muscular with a t-shirt on, dude.
[01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:00.560]  We get it.
[01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:02.540]  There was a kid here ten minutes ago.
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:07.320]  There's dogs around. It's inappropriate.
[01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:08.020]  Yeah.
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:10.720]  It's offensive.
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:10.940]  It's offensive.
[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:20.280]  See, this appears to be a black taxi, Andrew.
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:20.980]  That's unfortunate.
[01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:28.600]  Andrew's going to be so mad.
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:32.800]  Maybe we should add one for riding on the side of the street.
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:34.820]  Oh, yeah, on the sidewalk?
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:35.520]  Yeah.
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:37.420]  Sidewalk surfer.
[01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:40.100]  What does security in this place need?
[01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:44.720]  It's pretty hairy in there at Sloppy Joe's.
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:46.120]  Who bounces the bouncers?
[01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:53.080]  Alright, this is getting ridiculous.
[01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:54.680]  This is crazy.
[01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:56.120]  Is that a luxury vehicle?
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:56.600]  Some of it.
[01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:00.260]  Has lights on it.
[01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:03.140]  Some of us just want to go to sleep.
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:04.160]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:05.600]  Andrew?
[01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:07.620]  How many people are watching?
[01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:11.540]  I don't know.
[01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:14.340]  A handful?
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:15.180]  Probably less now.
[01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:16.760]  Is that a shirt?
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:18.560]  No, it's a Vagrant Records shirt.
[01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:20.960]  I mean, that's pretty offensive.
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:21.860]  That's it.
[01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:24.780]  Offensive to my 2023 sensibilities.
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:25.520]  Yeah, really.
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:28.420]  What kind of SUV is that?
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:29.900]  Not luxury.
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:34.720]  Earl, the McLarens.
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:36.100]  Oh, here comes a cab.
[01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:37.520]  I think it's pink.
[01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:38.900]  It could be.
[01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:42.260]  New boot goofing.
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:45.040]  Come on.
[01:31:45.260 --> 01:31:47.500]  No one has tried to get into a wrong car.
[01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:48.980]  Do you think that guy's a drug dealer?
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:52.320]  Because he has his one leg rolled up.
[01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:54.100]  Is that a thing?
[01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:55.480]  Yeah, that was always either.
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:57.060]  You were either riding a bicycle
[01:31:57.060 --> 01:31:59.780]  and you didn't want to get your pants caught in your chain
[01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:00.600]  or you were a drug dealer.
[01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:02.480]  Then I think he was riding a bicycle.
[01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:04.440]  He seemed to be on foot.
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:08.720]  He's got you there.
[01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:10.920]  That is true.
[01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:12.520]  There's a cab pulling up.
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:14.640]  I don't think
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:15.700]  it's going to be the color you need.
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:18.580]  Maybe it's one of those
[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:20.980]  color-changing cabs everyone's talking about.
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:22.400]  Oh, like a Hypercolors T-shirt?
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:24.440]  Yeah, like once four people get in,
[01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:25.960]  it heats up like a mood ring.
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:33.540]  Man, I had one of those Hypercolors T-shirts
[01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:34.940]  in high school. It was so fucking cool.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.880]  Until I realized the only people that wanted to talk to me about it
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:39.100]  were parents that thought it was clever.
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.480]  And they were like, I just have attracted all the moms and dads
[01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:41.880]  in the neighborhood.
[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:44.040]  Like MILFs and shit?
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:46.620]  No, like, oh that's so clever!
[01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:49.700]  I just wanted to be cool to girls.
[01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:52.380]  I think we're into some girls.
[01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:53.580]  Flag shirt.
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:56.360]  Yeah, our second flag shirt of the day.
[01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:00.020]  Look at that posse.
[01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:06.460]  It's the vertical stripe crew.
[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.540]  Yeah, they're dressed like refs.
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.380]  Golf cart again?
[01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:14.520]  They're making their way back.
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:16.340]  Maybe things are picking up.
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:18.020]  Somebody's on the ground.
[01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:19.600]  Oh, dude, in the back, somebody's on the ground.
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:21.280]  Oh, they just stood up. Were they gonna throw up?
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:23.800]  That'd be fun.
[01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:28.000]  Oh, look at all the shit that this bus is carrying.
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:32.520]  Oh. My. God.
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:33.760]  That lady...
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:37.640]  That lady is dressed like Blossom.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.200]  Nobody help her.
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:41.380]  100%.
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:42.440]  Red Shoes Twins.
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:47.520]  Yes, they are.
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:52.320]  Alright, here we go. It's gonna happen any second now. I feel it.
[01:33:52.620 --> 01:33:53.700]  What's gonna happen?
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:54.980]  Somebody's gonna win bingo.
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:58.360]  There's so many different ways we can win right now.
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:33:59.080]  Crosswalk Cowards.
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:01.760]  That was the whole unit of Crosswalk Cowards.
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:02.860]  Oh, what do we have there?
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:05.340]  What kind of car is that?
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:06.320]  Like a Saab?
[01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:08.420]  Like an old Saab?
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:10.580]  I would call Saab luxury.
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:12.280]  They don't make it anymore.
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:13.980]  I wouldn't call that a car luxury.
[01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:16.840]  It doesn't have luxury hubcaps, that's for sure.
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:23.140]  Nick with the hubcap judgment.
[01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:24.100]  Yeah, sorry.
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:26.480]  No, he's right.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:28.480]  It strikes me as a guy with hubcap opinions.
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:30.220]  That feels like a Nick thing.
[01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:31.620]  Should we have a hubcap draft?
[01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:34.140]  Oh, a hubcap draft.
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:35.440]  Oh, that'd be sick.
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:38.020]  All the different patterns.
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:40.400]  Ridiculous.
[01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:41.460]  Here's a third dog.
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:44.480]  Drop your cigarette, or is that a...
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:46.400]  Yeah, it's a cigarette.
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:47.100]  Drop it.
[01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:49.020]  In the litter.
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:50.800]  Puff pass throw.
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:53.440]  Puff pass throw.
[01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:57.240]  So if she drops this Andrew, do you win?
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:58.940]  I win. It's a bingo.
[01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:00.040]  Drop it.
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:01.100]  Drop it.
[01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:04.340]  Oh, go out of frame.
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:06.640]  No, don't block.
[01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:08.340]  Come on.
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:09.880]  The droppers are leaving.
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:12.660]  Come on, backpack kid. Drop the cigarette.
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:15.360]  Oh, he is carrying a backpack.
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:16.040]  What's he doing?
[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:18.300]  Drop it.
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:21.100]  You know you want to.
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:22.080]  Come on.
[01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:23.240]  Final toke.
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:25.920]  One more good one
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:26.980]  off that camel crush.
[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:28.960]  Come on. Drop it.
[01:35:29.340 --> 01:35:30.480]  You know he popped it.
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:34.140]  You know he popped it.
[01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:39.400]  She's...
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.720]  She's blocking the littering.
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:42.260]  Yep.
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:44.640]  That lady is carrying a blossoms hat.
[01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:46.680]  Come on.
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:47.280]  Come on.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:48.600]  Drop it.
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:48.880]  Drop it.
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:52.340]  Drop it.
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:53.500]  Drop it.
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:55.440]  Don't leave.
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:58.080]  Aggressive honking.
[01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:00.020]  Deal with it on camera.
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.120]  Could be...
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:03.120]  Give us an outcome.
[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:04.080]  Come on.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:06.400]  No.
[01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:09.680]  God, this is like Uno the movie all over again.
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:10.600]  Get out of here.
[01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:14.360]  It's your hand.
[01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:16.180]  You think this is frustrating?
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:18.180]  Wait for an hour and a half from now.
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:20.040]  Move your backpack.
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:27.720]  It's a disturbing lack of luxury cars out there.
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:28.180]  Jesus Christ.
[01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:30.320]  They are usually pretty common.
[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:31.560]  He was doing fish hand.
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:32.300]  What is that?
[01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:33.300]  What is that?
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:37.340]  Wait, wait.
[01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:38.760]  Did he just toss it?
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:41.580]  Where is it?
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:43.220]  I think they got rid of it.
[01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:44.000]  I think they got rid of it.
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:44.840]  I think he dropped it.
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:48.540]  I think that's what that was.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:49.440]  Is that a litterbug?
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:52.280]  Andrew, did you get it?
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:54.260]  It would be on the floor.
[01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:56.420]  No, it was just the ash.
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:57.460]  No.
[01:36:57.780 --> 01:36:58.940]  It was just the ash.
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:04.180]  He flicked the ash off the end and stepped on it.
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.260]  Is that really what happened?
[01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:06.400]  I think so.
[01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:07.760]  There is no secret on the ground.
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:10.140]  Can we get a zoom and enhance?
[01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:10.900]  Enhance!
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:13.060]  There is no zoom and enhance.
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:16.900]  Oh, no.
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:20.260]  Not going to get me anything.
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:25.360]  Why did you say that, Nick?
[01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:29.740]  You have to get up in like five hours.
[01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:31.340]  Why are you doing this?
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:33.400]  If I have to suffer, everyone does.
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:35.740]  You wouldn't stop the suffering.
[01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:38.840]  I still have to get up.
[01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:40.480]  Yeah, but I don't.
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:41.840]  I just sit in.
[01:37:47.350 --> 01:37:48.250]  Jesus Christ.
[01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:49.830]  This is insane.
[01:37:50.150 --> 01:37:50.930]  We got some more cabs.
[01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:55.630]  Fisher, I'm so sorry that you're still here.
[01:37:56.210 --> 01:37:58.510]  I absolutely should have said no.
[01:37:59.410 --> 01:38:00.390]  It's almost Saturday.
[01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:03.630]  That's a fancy looking car.
[01:38:03.630 --> 01:38:04.890]  That was a BMW, right?
[01:38:05.190 --> 01:38:05.790]  That's a luxury.
[01:38:06.210 --> 01:38:09.230]  It just drove by. It was in shitty condition.
[01:38:09.710 --> 01:38:12.390]  I mean, not every Beemer is a luxury car.
[01:38:13.410 --> 01:38:14.770]  Oh, here's another cigarette coming.
[01:38:16.850 --> 01:38:17.070]  Who?
[01:38:17.890 --> 01:38:19.890]  Oh, this guy decidedly didn't litter.
[01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:21.570]  He put it right in the trash can.
[01:38:23.010 --> 01:38:24.090]  Or is he smoking a cigar?
[01:38:24.690 --> 01:38:25.170]  It's a cigar.
[01:38:25.410 --> 01:38:26.470]  It's a cigar, yeah.
[01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:29.170]  Key West's cigar might be the move.
[01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:29.990]  I like that.
[01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:31.390]  Oh, he's smoking a cigar.
[01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:34.130]  I don't think I've smoked a cigar since I was 20.
[01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:35.830]  That's what I'm saying, man.
[01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:37.450]  I'm gonna try, Key West.
[01:38:38.350 --> 01:38:39.510]  Get sick to my tummy.
[01:38:41.630 --> 01:38:42.490]  Don't inhale.
[01:38:47.210 --> 01:38:48.630]  Oh, holy shit.
[01:38:50.770 --> 01:38:51.330]  What?
[01:38:51.650 --> 01:38:52.970]  We're still going.
[01:38:56.890 --> 01:38:57.910]  I'm sweaty.
[01:39:00.210 --> 01:39:01.150]  I'm broken.
[01:39:02.650 --> 01:39:03.590]  Jesus Christ.
[01:39:03.650 --> 01:39:05.470]  I just need somebody to fucking skateboard.
[01:39:06.110 --> 01:39:08.050]  What happened to the youth of America?
[01:39:09.290 --> 01:39:10.670]  They got lazy, Geoff.
[01:39:10.970 --> 01:39:13.730]  Is that an offensive jersey?
[01:39:16.370 --> 01:39:18.750]  Oh, is that a luxury car coming up?
[01:39:18.770 --> 01:39:19.430]  What is that? Hang on.
[01:39:19.490 --> 01:39:19.890]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:22.070]  Is this luxury?
[01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:23.870]  Just wait for Angie. You have to wait.
[01:39:24.190 --> 01:39:27.690]  Oh, those headlights look fancy to me.
[01:39:28.690 --> 01:39:30.870]  If it's a go-kart, though, I win.
[01:39:30.990 --> 01:39:32.430]  That guy's got socks on.
[01:39:32.710 --> 01:39:33.530]  He's gonna turn.
[01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:36.010]  Oh, that'd be funny.
[01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:37.750]  Everybody observe.
[01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:39.670]  Now, everybody, eyes open.
[01:39:40.250 --> 01:39:41.210]  Focus in.
[01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:42.670]  Eyes up, everybody.
[01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:45.490]  Everybody, eyes wide open.
[01:39:45.730 --> 01:39:46.870]  Oh, no, you need a pink cab.
[01:39:48.330 --> 01:39:49.230]  It's coming straight.
[01:39:50.190 --> 01:39:50.950]  It's coming straight.
[01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:52.990]  Oh, look at the side of that thing.
[01:39:54.050 --> 01:39:56.070]  That's just the same car we've seen.
[01:39:56.850 --> 01:39:58.470]  Why would you do that to me?
[01:39:59.510 --> 01:40:00.830]  Oh, that guy almost got hit by a car.
[01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:02.030]  That guy almost got hit by a car.
[01:40:02.570 --> 01:40:03.450]  Oh, is that what he's saying?
[01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:05.130]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:06.470]  Yeah, I'll agree.
[01:40:06.690 --> 01:40:07.590]  Holy shit.
[01:40:08.190 --> 01:40:10.390]  No, not a go-kart.
[01:40:10.750 --> 01:40:11.810]  You suck!
[01:40:13.970 --> 01:40:15.270]  You little shit.
[01:40:16.750 --> 01:40:17.850]  What kind of cake are you gonna get, Gavin?
[01:40:19.770 --> 01:40:20.130]  Colin.
[01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:21.390]  What?
[01:40:21.790 --> 01:40:24.430]  Can you get a Colin the Caterpillar in America?
[01:40:24.430 --> 01:40:25.650]  Probably import one.
[01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:27.750]  Import one?
[01:40:28.370 --> 01:40:31.530]  That guy's got... that is hard jeans and flip-flops right there.
[01:40:31.730 --> 01:40:32.850]  Dude, and a cowboy hat.
[01:40:32.850 --> 01:40:33.630]  And a cowboy hat.
[01:40:34.150 --> 01:40:34.650]  And a hug.
[01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:39.430]  Star Wars, too.
[01:40:45.070 --> 01:40:46.750]  Hey, that's the Hey Fuck Face guy.
[01:40:46.930 --> 01:40:47.890]  I have a picture with that guy.
[01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:49.510]  Oh, wait, hold on. Oh, yeah.
[01:40:50.150 --> 01:40:51.050]  That's an offensive shirt!
[01:40:51.690 --> 01:40:52.090]  Wait.
[01:40:52.850 --> 01:40:54.430]  Oh, the Hey Fuck Face shirt?
[01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:56.930]  Yeah, that's an offensive shirt.
[01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:58.130]  Did you win? Uh, no.
[01:40:58.810 --> 01:40:59.610]  Thanks, Gavin.
[01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:01.130]  But now if I get wheelchair, I win.
[01:41:02.570 --> 01:41:04.170]  We're never getting wheelchair, Geoff.
[01:41:04.650 --> 01:41:05.590]  We've never seen that here.
[01:41:07.010 --> 01:41:08.410]  We've never seen...
[01:41:08.410 --> 01:41:09.770]  I've never seen a go-kart.
[01:41:10.010 --> 01:41:12.190]  I still have never seen anyone trying to get in the wrong car.
[01:41:12.750 --> 01:41:15.230]  And waiting for somebody to wait up ain't happening.
[01:41:17.010 --> 01:41:18.710]  Yeah, there needs to be people for that.
[01:41:18.710 --> 01:41:19.710]  Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:41:19.890 --> 01:41:22.750]  She said, hey, and then...
[01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:24.570]  Yeah, and then what?
[01:41:25.170 --> 01:41:26.210]  They're friends.
[01:41:29.670 --> 01:41:30.630]  It's a shiny car.
[01:41:34.090 --> 01:41:35.330]  Now you're getting it.
[01:41:39.610 --> 01:41:41.610]  Why is this not ending?
[01:41:43.890 --> 01:41:45.490]  Do we still have bingo kits?
[01:41:45.630 --> 01:41:48.110]  How can people resist this experience?
[01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:50.430]  This misery.
[01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:52.530]  Buy our bingo kits today.
[01:41:52.810 --> 01:41:54.810]  Yeah, it's like, buy our bingo kits.
[01:41:55.090 --> 01:41:55.510]  This could be you.
[01:41:55.870 --> 01:41:56.650]  I mean, here's the thing.
[01:41:56.670 --> 01:41:58.170]  You should have your own version of Last Exit.
[01:41:58.450 --> 01:42:02.530]  We're still doing this for you to sell this stuff.
[01:42:02.730 --> 01:42:05.190]  This was never intended for us to go this long.
[01:42:05.410 --> 01:42:05.730]  No.
[01:42:06.110 --> 01:42:07.410]  You should go buy something.
[01:42:07.770 --> 01:42:09.750]  If you're still watching this thing and you haven't.
[01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:12.430]  If you're watching this and you haven't bought anything, what are you doing?
[01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:13.350]  That's crazy.
[01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:14.730]  They're playing bingo is what they're doing.
[01:42:14.730 --> 01:42:17.170]  We were afraid it was going to end way too soon.
[01:42:17.170 --> 01:42:18.610]  He popped onto the curb!
[01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:20.250]  He popped onto the curb!
[01:42:20.710 --> 01:42:21.010]  Did he?
[01:42:21.530 --> 01:42:24.330]  Does that mean anything?
[01:42:24.890 --> 01:42:25.150]  No.
[01:42:25.670 --> 01:42:29.470]  That's not a luxury car. You're telling me that's not a luxury vehicle.
[01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:30.710]  It's a Dodge.
[01:42:30.850 --> 01:42:31.910]  That's a Dodge.
[01:42:32.170 --> 01:42:35.710]  Yeah, I mean, that's like a cool $48,000 car, I guess.
[01:42:35.810 --> 01:42:37.070]  But I wouldn't call it luxury.
[01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:39.130]  It's like if the Starborn were driving.
[01:42:39.130 --> 01:42:44.900]  Is that her dad?
[01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:46.960]  I was wondering the same thing.
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:47.960]  Is that like a...
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:49.440]  I need a bandage, dude.
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:50.820]  There hasn't been a bandage, dude.
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:51.740]  I haven't seen one either.
[01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:53.580]  Holy ass.
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:56.560]  Calm down.
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:42:58.500]  He's got his flashers on.
[01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:00.680]  Oh, that guy...
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:02.680]  No.
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:05.700]  Are you trying to get formal wear out of him?
[01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:07.660]  He was looking pretty...
[01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:08.180]  What's this?
[01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:11.320]  This is the same car we have seen five times, guys.
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:15.820]  It's a nice Mustang, though.
[01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:17.020]  It's pretty nice.
[01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:21.140]  Throw it on the ground.
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:22.820]  Whatever it is, throw it on the ground.
[01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:24.720]  Just drop your drink.
[01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:29.800]  What if we see a pink taxi littering?
[01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:33.040]  I guess it'll be a...
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:34.160]  Like a Transformer?
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:34.760]  Yeah.
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:40.440]  Oh my god.
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:44.380]  I feel insane.
[01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.760]  I don't understand how this is happening.
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:49.700]  This is the first time I've ever
[01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:51.420]  second-guessed Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:53.780]  Just like as a concept?
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:54.560]  As a concept.
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:56.800]  It's probably so much entertainment.
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:58.560]  I'm now just cheering for everyone.
[01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:01.740]  I don't want to care if I win. I just want somebody to win.
[01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:03.580]  I really want Andrew to win because I feel like
[01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:05.800]  the pink taxi's got to be the most plausible.
[01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:06.700]  Yeah.
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:09.500]  And we can all share a cake.
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:10.880]  Oh, is that FaceTime?
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:11.920]  That's FaceTime.
[01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:12.780]  Yeah.
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:16.280]  That was definitely FaceTime.
[01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:18.780]  Is that FaceTime? Are we saying that was FaceTime?
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:20.060]  Yeah.
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:21.720]  They're still doing it.
[01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:24.020]  They're talking to their kid.
[01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:25.200]  I have Bingo.
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:26.920]  Bingo!
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:30.440]  Nose pick. Get out late.
[01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:32.620]  Handshake. Can't see FaceTime screen.
[01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:33.620]  Oh my god.
[01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:35.960]  That was it.
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:37.260]  Congratulations, Eric.
[01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:39.680]  All it took was an extra 46 fucking minutes.
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:41.040]  I think you're undefeated.
[01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:43.780]  I am undefeated in Sloppy Jizz Bingo.
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.500]  I've gone 3-0 with
[01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:46.700]  zero cakes.
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:49.200]  Feeling bad.
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:53.420]  Feeling bad about this one.
[01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:55.660]  But, you know,
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:57.520]  it is what it is.
[01:44:58.100 --> 01:44:59.680]  That lady's sucking on a chili dog.
[01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:00.960]  She just went by sucking on a chili dog.
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:02.920]  Is she really? Oh my god.
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:05.960]  Well, we did it.
[01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:07.020]  How do you feel?
[01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:10.980]  I feel less than I did.
[01:45:11.660 --> 01:45:12.280]  Is that right?
[01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:14.180]  Thanks for buying stuff.
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:17.280]  We had a great time. We played Sloppy Jizz Bingo.
[01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:18.760]  You never know how it's gonna go.
[01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:21.080]  Sometimes you slop the Joe
[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:22.840]  and sometimes the Joe slops you.
[01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:25.000]  That guy just fucking spilled
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:25.500]  drink.
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:28.020]  He's a litter bug.
[01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:29.220]  Fuck.
[01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:30.600]  It's brutal.
[01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:32.080]  It's too late.
[01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:35.000]  Eric's queuing up for this cake.
[01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:37.600]  I'll share my cake with you if I can come swimming.
[01:45:37.740 --> 01:45:38.660]  But that's it. I'm sorry.
[01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:40.640]  You wanna come on Sunday?
[01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:41.860]  Yeah.
[01:45:42.740 --> 01:45:43.100]  Alright.
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:48.500]  We'll go to store.roosterteeth.com
[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:49.560]  see what's still on sale.
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:51.840]  Also, hey.
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:53.500]  Listen to Nick. Ready?
[01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:55.960]  Three, two, one.
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:57.800]  Face
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:59.880]  the podcast, but also starting
[01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:01.740]  on Friday the 6th,
[01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:03.620]  we are taking over the Let's Play channel.
[01:46:03.980 --> 01:46:05.940]  Our very first video, I think we already announced
[01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:06.980]  it, is Worms.
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:09.660]  Watch us play Worms.
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:12.200]  It is bombastic.
[01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:13.980]  And I'm very excited about it.
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:15.560]  And then on Monday,
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:17.680]  we'll start...
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:19.380]  Hang on. I actually have it.
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:20.160]  Beach Cuff?
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:22.220]  No, that's just the one with tattoos.
[01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:23.760]  On Monday the 9th,
[01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:25.220]  Face Off
[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:27.260]  will start.
[01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:29.080]  But you gotta sign up for first for that.
[01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:31.280]  If you go to fuckfacepod.com
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:32.040]  slash first
[01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:35.300]  I have to say the URL for this one, sorry.
[01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:37.120]  If you go to fuckfacepod.com
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:39.120]  slash first and sign up,
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:41.360]  that is how you support us directly.
[01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:43.520]  People are like, oh, how do I do that?
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:45.480]  Sign up through that
[01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:47.420]  and then listen to the show
[01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:49.280]  on the first RSS feed or
[01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:51.500]  watch stuff on the site.
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:53.400]  But there you go. I win.
[01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:54.720]  I'm very excited to win.
[01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:56.300]  I'm very excited this is done.
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:58.340]  My wife texted me and said, I'm going to bed.
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:46:59.840]  So...
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:02.820]  I will be going to bed shortly as well.
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:04.500]  Eric is undefeated.
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:07.420]  Yeah, so pretty excited
[01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:09.040]  about eating a cake maybe.
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:10.000]  So, we'll see.
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:11.640]  Me too.
[01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:12.900]  Geoff, anything else?
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:16.200]  No, I just really appreciate everybody tuning in
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:17.620]  and spending a Friday night with us.
[01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:19.680]  Hopefully it was enjoyable for you.
[01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:21.160]  It started out that way for us.
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:22.280]  It became a little torturous.
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:25.940]  But once again, that's how it goes sometimes
[01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:27.380]  when you're slopping and you're joeing.
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:30.020]  You never know. It's happening live,
[01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:31.420]  ladies and gentlemen. It's unpredictable.
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:33.620]  And every once in a while,
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:35.780]  everybody decides to mind their manners
[01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:36.540]  and behave themselves.
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:39.440]  Well, I don't appreciate it. I hope you don't either.
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:41.780]  Oh, there's this guy.
[01:47:42.740 --> 01:47:43.660]  We'll end on him.
[01:47:43.660 --> 01:47:44.640]  Wait, what's he say?
[01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:47.220]  That's the dude that's like the Geoff Ramsey
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:48.160]  fuckface guy.
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:50.420]  Oh, he just said it!
[01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:52.380]  He's the name of the show!
[01:47:54.580 --> 01:47:55.500]  That's that guy.
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:56.260]  We've seen him before.
[01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:58.600]  That's great. Well, hey, thanks for watching, guys.
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:00.380]  Listen to the podcast. We'll see you later.
[01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:01.020]  Bye.
[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:03.720]  Thanks, Fisher. Thanks, Michael.
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:03.920]  Bye.
