[00:10.410 --> 00:14.430]  Hello and welcome to the Summer of 98 movie ranking.
[00:14.670 --> 00:17.230]  This is slightly different than a draft.
[00:18.050 --> 00:20.270]  I did better than Gavin, didn't I, when he had his thing?
[00:20.550 --> 00:22.170]  Is this a better start? Worse start?
[00:22.490 --> 00:25.510]  Are you rating your start in the middle of the story?
[00:25.530 --> 00:26.930]  No, I'm just asking where...
[00:26.930 --> 00:27.750]  You haven't finished the intro yet.
[00:27.930 --> 00:31.270]  It would have been better than mine if you didn't stop yours to compare it to mine.
[00:31.670 --> 00:32.030]  That's fair.
[00:32.030 --> 00:33.950]  And give yourself accolades in the same breath.
[00:33.950 --> 00:37.750]  No, I was asking. I was asking if it was better or worse.
[00:37.750 --> 00:40.470]  I would have said yes up until that point.
[00:40.710 --> 00:42.410]  It was an evaluation. Okay, so I shouldn't do that.
[00:42.550 --> 00:44.150]  Anyway, Summer of 98 movies.
[00:44.790 --> 00:47.090]  We have a list of all the films that release wide.
[00:47.490 --> 00:50.390]  Eric thinks that 98 was the last good year.
[00:50.630 --> 00:53.490]  So we're making some supplemental content for it.
[00:53.870 --> 00:55.890]  This is going to be a little bit different than a draft.
[00:56.030 --> 00:57.930]  We're going to determine what the top ten is
[00:57.930 --> 01:00.470]  and argue for where these things should be placed.
[01:01.010 --> 01:03.850]  We have to all collectively agree on the rankings
[01:03.850 --> 01:09.490]  and then ultimately deciding what is the definitive movie of Summer of 98.
[01:09.910 --> 01:15.690]  If you are just listening to this, you'll be able to watch this on our YouTube channel.
[01:16.130 --> 01:20.050]  We'll be having a list streamed from Eric's account where we go through the films.
[01:20.710 --> 01:23.390]  Do we have that? Are we recording the video of this now?
[01:23.410 --> 01:24.630]  I don't know. I assume that.
[01:24.790 --> 01:24.970]  Yes, I am.
[01:25.170 --> 01:28.610]  Okay, wow. I really should have double checked that.
[01:28.670 --> 01:30.150]  That was a wild assumption by me.
[01:30.390 --> 01:33.110]  That was a really wild assumption.
[01:33.670 --> 01:35.850]  I appreciate the confidence in it, though.
[01:36.210 --> 01:39.190]  Yeah, I believed. I never even considered it wasn't.
[01:39.350 --> 01:40.270]  If you think you're right, you're right.
[01:40.650 --> 01:41.590]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:41.830 --> 01:41.910]  Sure.
[01:42.450 --> 01:43.470]  So we're going to go through it.
[01:43.490 --> 01:47.510]  We're each going to select three films that we think should be in the running.
[01:47.710 --> 01:51.010]  And then from there, we will edit it down to ten.
[01:51.370 --> 01:55.950]  And then once we have ten, we will make our cases for which movie should go where
[01:55.950 --> 01:58.010]  with every rank being important.
[01:58.190 --> 02:02.810]  Like, if you strongly believe that a movie should be seventh, fight for that.
[02:02.810 --> 02:03.790]  Fight for that position.
[02:04.230 --> 02:07.310]  What if you like movies that aren't on the list?
[02:07.770 --> 02:10.130]  Well, these are all the wide releases of the Summer of 98.
[02:10.830 --> 02:13.850]  If you want to add other movies, I guess you could.
[02:14.610 --> 02:16.690]  Yeah, what else do we need to add to this list?
[02:16.870 --> 02:19.850]  I need to see the full list before I can answer that.
[02:20.150 --> 02:23.090]  Okay, Andrew, do you want to read off everything on the list?
[02:23.570 --> 02:23.970]  Sure.
[02:24.670 --> 02:27.250]  Okay, so we're going through. It's long. It's like 33 films.
[02:27.250 --> 02:29.250]  In June, we have...
[02:48.970 --> 02:51.630]  And then in August, we have...
[03:04.310 --> 03:05.670]  Those are our films.
[03:05.970 --> 03:07.330]  Are we missing anything, Geoff?
[03:07.830 --> 03:11.090]  Well, yeah. It's not a big deal.
[03:11.890 --> 03:15.890]  But I looked up... Buffalo 66 came out in the Summer of 98.
[03:15.970 --> 03:17.330]  I thought that was a phenomenal film.
[03:17.470 --> 03:19.130]  When did it come out?
[03:19.530 --> 03:21.550]  It came out June 26, 1998.
[03:22.490 --> 03:23.990]  Also, Hands on a Hard Body came out.
[03:23.990 --> 03:30.410]  The Last Days of Disco, which was a Whit Stillman film that I really liked, came out on June 12.
[03:31.250 --> 03:34.750]  Then Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, you may have heard of it.
[03:34.850 --> 03:37.830]  That came out August 28, 1998.
[03:39.270 --> 03:40.990]  Why is our list missing so many?
[03:41.050 --> 03:44.950]  And then Run, Lola, Run, which was also a pretty big film, came out August 20, 1998.
[03:45.190 --> 03:49.230]  I'm just throwing those out there because I was looking at the list earlier and I didn't see them on there.
[03:49.410 --> 03:50.390]  We don't need to add.
[03:51.030 --> 03:51.870]  Oh, they've been added.
[03:51.870 --> 03:54.090]  No, no, no. They're added.
[03:56.010 --> 04:03.890]  I went off of Box Office Mojo and looked at what released within those months and then selected the films that released to a wide audience.
[04:04.750 --> 04:08.690]  Because I sort of view the Summer of 98 as the things you go to the theater and see.
[04:08.710 --> 04:11.990]  You're looking at blockbusters and those weren't necessarily blockbusters.
[04:12.030 --> 04:15.590]  I didn't realize Lock, Stock wasn't big at the time. I thought it was a huge movie.
[04:16.070 --> 04:21.170]  Well, I think it probably didn't get an initial wide release, but it's become such a part of...
[04:21.170 --> 04:22.810]  It's become such a big post.
[04:23.130 --> 04:29.790]  That's why Run, Lola, Run and Lock, Stock I wanted to add in specifically because they became huge movies, but they didn't start as huge movies.
[04:30.150 --> 04:30.670]  That is true.
[04:31.110 --> 04:33.450]  So we're picking three each from these?
[04:34.110 --> 04:41.130]  Yes. So each person will take three films and then we'll move it from the base list to a different list.
[04:41.950 --> 04:46.070]  And then from there we will deliberate on what should be in our top ten.
[04:46.650 --> 04:50.070]  Wow, this is... only picking three is tough.
[04:51.210 --> 05:00.310]  Yeah, there's some layers to it of like, are you going to take... maybe there's a movie you think someone will definitely take so you don't take that, but you're risking maybe not making the list at all.
[05:00.870 --> 05:04.130]  Who wants to go first as far as picking the first three films?
[05:04.770 --> 05:05.030]  I'll go.
[05:05.510 --> 05:05.770]  Okay.
[05:06.350 --> 05:10.070]  Am I going like three across all three months or three per month?
[05:10.210 --> 05:12.630]  Just three across all the movies that are available.
[05:12.630 --> 05:18.090]  How should I be listing this also? Should I just write someone's name and then like their movies and then we make a list?
[05:18.530 --> 05:26.710]  You don't even need to put the name. We can just... whatever Geoff picks, we'll just make a separate film list and then we'll get rid of the base list once we have our selections.
[05:27.150 --> 05:28.690]  Got it. Alright, Geoff, whenever you're ready.
[05:29.190 --> 05:30.150]  Can I see the list again?
[05:30.730 --> 05:31.630]  You can't.
[05:34.090 --> 05:35.610]  Do you want Andrew to read it one more time?
[05:35.930 --> 05:38.070]  No, no, no. I can only see what you're showing me.
[05:38.770 --> 05:40.330]  I sent it to you also.
[05:40.770 --> 05:41.970]  Oh yeah, that's true.
[05:42.850 --> 05:43.830]  Just in case.
[05:43.830 --> 05:45.070]  Navigate away from... hold on.
[05:45.090 --> 05:46.350]  I mean, you don't have to navigate away.
[05:46.450 --> 05:47.190]  No, I'm doing it.
[05:47.210 --> 05:52.230]  I'm navigating. No, I don't want to put you out. Okay. Hold on.
[05:52.250 --> 05:53.750]  I'm loading up another thing.
[05:54.030 --> 05:56.490]  No, I mean, you don't have to. I'm showing you the list here.
[05:56.570 --> 05:57.730]  Oh, let's see.
[05:58.230 --> 05:59.050]  I mean, the list is here.
[05:59.190 --> 06:01.650]  What are the three movies Geoff's gonna pick?
[06:02.290 --> 06:05.490]  Well, I'm definitely picking Blade because I have a Blade tattoo.
[06:06.290 --> 06:07.730]  You have a Blade tattoo?
[06:07.970 --> 06:08.570]  Really? Where?
[06:09.190 --> 06:11.190]  On my neck. Gus and I got it together.
[06:11.190 --> 06:12.110]  It was like a friendship.
[06:12.630 --> 06:14.650]  Dude, Gus and Blade tattoos?
[06:14.950 --> 06:17.330]  Oh, that's right. I forgot about that.
[06:17.450 --> 06:18.830]  You showed me that before.
[06:19.170 --> 06:20.790]  Yeah, it's like the little Renfield thing.
[06:20.950 --> 06:23.650]  I have the Dragon Eddie clan. Gus has the Kobayashi clan.
[06:24.810 --> 06:26.150]  So I'm definitely picking that.
[06:26.550 --> 06:28.490]  Clearly picking Dirty Work, one of the best movies ever made.
[06:28.610 --> 06:29.070]  Oh, yeah.
[06:29.710 --> 06:33.310]  And then I'm gonna... I'm gonna zig.
[06:33.970 --> 06:34.250]  Okay.
[06:34.410 --> 06:35.130]  I'm gonna zig.
[06:35.570 --> 06:37.630]  And I'm gonna pick A Perfect Murder.
[06:38.310 --> 06:39.150]  Oh, okay. Wow.
[06:39.610 --> 06:40.090]  Really?
[06:40.090 --> 06:40.310]  Really.
[06:40.830 --> 06:41.890]  Great movie. Great movie.
[06:42.270 --> 06:42.530]  Wow.
[06:43.550 --> 06:45.250]  What is A Perfect Murder, Geoff?
[06:45.810 --> 06:46.510]  What is it?
[06:47.570 --> 06:48.710]  Right. What is the movie?
[06:49.150 --> 06:51.250]  It's like a Gwyneth Paltrow movie with...
[06:52.030 --> 06:55.390]  It's like a remake of an Alfred Hitchcock movie.
[06:55.750 --> 06:57.330]  It's got, I think, Michael Douglas in it.
[06:57.550 --> 07:00.630]  And Aragorn is in it.
[07:00.630 --> 07:02.350]  I can't think of his name. Strider.
[07:02.530 --> 07:03.050]  Viggo Mortensen.
[07:03.290 --> 07:04.050]  Yeah, Viggo Mortensen.
[07:06.030 --> 07:09.010]  And it's... yeah, it's just a...
[07:09.910 --> 07:12.550]  It's like a... it's a murder mystery kind of thing.
[07:12.850 --> 07:15.270]  That's based off, I think, Dialed In for Murder, the Alfred Hitchcock movie.
[07:15.290 --> 07:15.870]  It is, yeah.
[07:16.010 --> 07:19.890]  You know, a weird thing about A Perfect Murder is it's written by two people.
[07:20.430 --> 07:23.010]  And one of the writers only wrote one other movie.
[07:23.170 --> 07:24.450]  And it's a Michael Douglas movie.
[07:24.850 --> 07:24.870]  Really?
[07:24.870 --> 07:26.970]  So I wonder if it's, like, a fake writer name.
[07:27.310 --> 07:30.030]  And if, like, that's a credit for somebody else under an alias.
[07:30.170 --> 07:31.590]  Like, I just... I thought that was so weird.
[07:31.590 --> 07:34.390]  That they've only written two and they're back-to-back Douglas movies.
[07:34.890 --> 07:35.250]  Interesting.
[07:36.030 --> 07:37.430]  You reckon it's Douglas himself?
[07:37.810 --> 07:41.670]  I kind of wondered if, like, to, like, get a credit, like, some additional money.
[07:42.230 --> 07:43.130]  Shall I do mine?
[07:43.690 --> 07:43.950]  Sure.
[07:44.250 --> 07:45.150]  Gavin, would you like to go next?
[07:45.550 --> 07:49.230]  I'll be honest. I feel like if I could, I'd pick all three from July.
[07:49.430 --> 07:50.810]  But I'm gonna pick Truman Show.
[07:52.690 --> 07:55.690]  There's some good shit in July, but obviously I have to go with Basketball.
[07:57.250 --> 07:59.790]  And then I'll do Logstock.
[08:00.350 --> 08:01.250]  Ah, damn.
[08:01.790 --> 08:02.290]  Good pick.
[08:02.730 --> 08:02.930]  Okay.
[08:03.370 --> 08:03.790]  Great movies.
[08:05.170 --> 08:06.370]  Andrew, do you want to go next?
[08:07.410 --> 08:09.990]  Sure. Let me view the list from it.
[08:10.290 --> 08:12.650]  Do you see the thing I sent you, Gavin, about Basketball?
[08:13.910 --> 08:14.350]  Yeah.
[08:14.630 --> 08:17.910]  I sent Gavin a clip of Joey Diaz as in Basketball.
[08:18.690 --> 08:22.790]  And when he was in it, he was in, like, his deep coke addict phase.
[08:23.010 --> 08:26.370]  And in the movie, the refs have to wear roller skates.
[08:26.370 --> 08:31.170]  And so every day after shooting, he would steal a pair of roller skates and sell them.
[08:31.330 --> 08:33.590]  And that was just, like, his day-to-day go-to money.
[08:33.710 --> 08:35.170]  He'd make $150 a day.
[08:35.470 --> 08:40.650]  And then by, like, the time they got to, like, one of his scenes near the end of the shoot,
[08:40.770 --> 08:43.850]  they couldn't find roller skates for him because he had sold all of them.
[08:44.010 --> 08:45.590]  And nobody knew that he was stealing them.
[08:47.130 --> 08:47.490]  Okay.
[08:49.110 --> 08:50.490]  What am I gonna pick? This is...
[08:51.750 --> 08:52.390]  This is tough.
[08:52.430 --> 08:55.050]  So I've seen 99% of these movies.
[08:55.050 --> 08:57.670]  I haven't seen some of the additions Geoff added.
[08:59.070 --> 09:01.410]  Fuck, this is... this is tough.
[09:01.530 --> 09:03.050]  I'm going to add...
[09:03.710 --> 09:05.770]  I'm gonna add Return to Paradise.
[09:06.230 --> 09:06.950]  Okay.
[09:09.790 --> 09:12.050]  I am going to add...
[09:12.830 --> 09:14.430]  The X-Files.
[09:15.190 --> 09:15.970]  Ooh, okay.
[09:18.330 --> 09:20.390]  And I'm gonna add Small Soldiers.
[09:21.110 --> 09:21.830]  Oh.
[09:22.430 --> 09:22.790]  Ooh.
[09:22.970 --> 09:24.050]  Okay. Okay.
[09:25.050 --> 09:26.870]  Nick, would you like to do yours next? I'll go last.
[09:26.870 --> 09:30.990]  Sure. Yeah, I feel like a lot of the ones that I was thinking about have been taken,
[09:31.150 --> 09:33.050]  but I will add this one because...
[09:33.790 --> 09:35.990]  One, I saw it when it came out, which is probably too young,
[09:36.110 --> 09:39.610]  but Saving Private Ryan is one of my favorite war movies.
[09:40.130 --> 09:42.950]  And, you know, it eventually led to things like Band of Brothers and The Pacific,
[09:43.090 --> 09:45.870]  which are really good shows that HBO put out.
[09:48.710 --> 09:49.430]  And then...
[09:49.430 --> 09:53.050]  I was thinking that...
[09:53.050 --> 09:55.010]  Oh, you picked Small Soldiers already. Look at that. See?
[09:55.350 --> 09:58.110]  I'll tell you what. I'll add this because it was one of the first horror movies I saw.
[09:58.390 --> 10:03.130]  Halloween H20 also has one of the most interesting death scenes
[10:03.130 --> 10:06.390]  in where someone is killed with an ice skate to the face.
[10:08.670 --> 10:09.390]  And then...
[10:10.570 --> 10:12.050]  And then I'll also add...
[10:13.650 --> 10:15.050]  I think a movie that...
[10:16.770 --> 10:19.590]  That... I don't know if a lot of y'all would have seen this,
[10:19.590 --> 10:23.170]  but the Six Days, Seven Nights, just because I liked Harrison Ford a lot.
[10:23.730 --> 10:24.710]  And that was a...
[10:24.710 --> 10:26.090]  That's another Anne H. film, right?
[10:26.230 --> 10:26.470]  Yeah.
[10:26.650 --> 10:28.050]  Yeah. And she is...
[10:28.050 --> 10:29.330]  She's dead, by the way.
[10:29.830 --> 10:30.050]  Yeah.
[10:30.470 --> 10:31.350]  Yeah, she died.
[10:31.690 --> 10:32.370]  She lived in that movie.
[10:32.870 --> 10:33.730]  Anne H. died.
[10:34.810 --> 10:38.270]  Okay, so I have my picks last.
[10:38.690 --> 10:40.770]  I don't know how popular they're going to be,
[10:41.090 --> 10:46.650]  but I will say that Nick has taken one of mine, which was Saving Private Ryan.
[10:48.110 --> 10:50.990]  I will pivot and make a different pick,
[10:51.090 --> 10:53.590]  because it is not on this list, and I think it should be,
[10:54.190 --> 10:55.650]  in Armageddon.
[10:56.890 --> 10:58.850]  To not be on this list, I think, is crazy.
[10:59.170 --> 11:01.090]  Giant movie in the summer of 98.
[11:02.210 --> 11:02.650]  Massive.
[11:02.650 --> 11:03.130]  Very realistic.
[11:03.950 --> 11:07.450]  Here are my next two picks that I'm going to fight for my life
[11:07.450 --> 11:08.610]  to get them in the top ten.
[11:10.410 --> 11:14.590]  Can't Hardly Wait is a movie that I really, really like,
[11:14.590 --> 11:16.770]  that I don't know if anyone...
[11:16.770 --> 11:18.310]  Andrew, I'm sure you've watched it now.
[11:19.510 --> 11:20.610]  Geoff, have you seen this?
[11:20.850 --> 11:23.070]  I fucking hate that movie.
[11:23.350 --> 11:24.910]  I knew it.
[11:25.170 --> 11:28.210]  I had a feeling that Geoff has either not seen this,
[11:28.270 --> 11:30.450]  or does not like this movie at all.
[11:30.810 --> 11:31.490]  Who's in it?
[11:31.490 --> 11:35.710]  I was just too old to be the guy for that movie.
[11:35.990 --> 11:36.390]  Exactly.
[11:36.870 --> 11:38.470]  I just missed the mark on it.
[11:38.750 --> 11:40.310]  Exactly what I was going to say,
[11:40.310 --> 11:45.530]  is that for my age, when this movie came out, awesome.
[11:46.110 --> 11:49.890]  Your age, when this movie came out, this movie fucking sucks.
[11:49.970 --> 11:51.050]  Why would anyone watch it?
[11:51.170 --> 11:51.550]  100%.
[11:53.010 --> 11:59.710]  Lastly, one that I really love, that again, I don't know who else here watched it.
[12:00.610 --> 12:02.210]  Nicolas Cage's Snake Eyes.
[12:04.710 --> 12:06.870]  Are you guys familiar with Snake Eyes?
[12:06.950 --> 12:07.730]  Have you seen this movie?
[12:08.190 --> 12:08.550]  Yes.
[12:08.770 --> 12:08.990]  No.
[12:08.990 --> 12:10.130]  I think I've seen it.
[12:10.130 --> 12:10.670]  I don't think so.
[12:10.670 --> 12:11.170]  Let me look it up.
[12:11.890 --> 12:13.990]  It is a Brian De Palma...
[12:14.890 --> 12:20.890]  I don't know if he's deep in his Coke habit here or what,
[12:21.130 --> 12:27.990]  but I don't know a way to explain what this is,
[12:28.030 --> 12:33.110]  other than him slumping so hard in his career
[12:33.110 --> 12:35.650]  that I don't know that he ever pulls out of it.
[12:36.110 --> 12:37.350]  I love this movie.
[12:37.350 --> 12:39.070]  It's fucking insane.
[12:39.210 --> 12:41.630]  It is so insane.
[12:42.130 --> 12:43.610]  It looks crazy.
[12:43.770 --> 12:45.070]  It sounds crazy.
[12:45.190 --> 12:46.930]  The timeline is crazy.
[12:46.990 --> 12:47.730]  I love it.
[12:47.890 --> 12:50.130]  Snake Eyes is my final pick for this.
[12:50.270 --> 12:53.110]  A thing about Snake Eyes is really funny,
[12:53.290 --> 12:55.690]  is that at the end of the film,
[12:56.270 --> 13:00.570]  there's a character that says a line about how they keep having a nightmare about their drowning,
[13:00.990 --> 13:03.450]  and it doesn't really make sense contextually.
[13:03.830 --> 13:05.270]  And the reason why it doesn't make sense
[13:05.270 --> 13:08.770]  is because it's in reference to what the scripted ending was,
[13:08.850 --> 13:09.990]  that they completely cut,
[13:10.390 --> 13:12.230]  because they either ran out of time or money.
[13:12.750 --> 13:15.470]  There's a massive storm happening throughout the whole film,
[13:15.610 --> 13:17.690]  and it never really pays off in any way.
[13:17.990 --> 13:20.590]  There's supposed to be a giant tidal wave
[13:20.590 --> 13:22.690]  that hits the casino that they're in,
[13:22.970 --> 13:25.610]  so it makes sense that he maybe would have almost drowned,
[13:25.810 --> 13:27.510]  but it just never happens in the film.
[13:27.830 --> 13:29.850]  However, since they don't shoot films linearly,
[13:30.350 --> 13:31.510]  they had to keep it in,
[13:31.770 --> 13:34.010]  because they had already shot that sequence.
[13:34.010 --> 13:38.650]  So it's a really weird throwaway to a moment that never happens in the film.
[13:39.010 --> 13:40.010]  It's very odd.
[13:40.830 --> 13:44.190]  It's like Data talking about the octopus in Goonies.
[13:44.830 --> 13:45.170]  Exactly.
[13:46.150 --> 13:47.450]  Oh, I forgot about that.
[13:47.850 --> 13:47.970]  Yeah.
[13:48.850 --> 13:50.010]  Gavin, you ever seen Snake Eyes?
[13:51.050 --> 13:51.350]  No.
[13:53.270 --> 13:54.830]  That's a no, I'm gonna assume.
[13:55.710 --> 13:56.610]  Can no one hear me?
[13:57.270 --> 13:57.970]  Gavin, are you here?
[13:58.270 --> 13:58.510]  Gavin?
[13:59.730 --> 14:01.190]  What the fuck happened to Gavin?
[14:02.790 --> 14:03.510]  Oh no!
[14:05.170 --> 14:06.330]  Can no one hear me?
[14:06.530 --> 14:06.690]  No.
[14:07.530 --> 14:10.710]  Oh, I was wondering why you were ignoring me for the last...
[14:10.710 --> 14:12.130]  No one's heard a word you've been saying.
[14:12.230 --> 14:14.990]  Dude, the last 10 minutes, everything I said, no one gave a shit about.
[14:15.210 --> 14:16.350]  No one's in my conscience.
[14:19.210 --> 14:19.810]  Oh, okay.
[14:20.450 --> 14:22.590]  Haven't heard a word you've been saying.
[14:22.670 --> 14:23.130]  Oh, I know.
[14:23.410 --> 14:23.870]  Thought it was crazy,
[14:23.990 --> 14:27.030]  thought maybe you were just mad about the pics,
[14:27.170 --> 14:28.210]  and didn't want to talk.
[14:28.470 --> 14:30.390]  Do you want to give us a recap of what we missed?
[14:30.390 --> 14:31.850]  Yeah, what have you been saying?
[14:32.090 --> 14:33.050]  Yeah, anything from...
[14:33.050 --> 14:35.530]  I would say from when you made your pic of Lockstock,
[14:35.970 --> 14:38.210]  after that, have not heard you say a word.
[14:39.130 --> 14:41.610]  You've been real fucking lazy in the content.
[14:42.270 --> 14:44.070]  I was talking about the roller skates clip,
[14:44.150 --> 14:46.050]  when Eric said Can't Hardly Wait,
[14:46.150 --> 14:47.550]  I was like, oh, who's in that?
[14:47.630 --> 14:50.590]  And then he went, anyway, my next pic is Snake Eyes.
[14:54.890 --> 14:55.770]  What happened?
[14:58.530 --> 15:00.190]  Son of a bitch!
[15:00.250 --> 15:02.930]  Yeah, you cut out as soon as you reacted to me asking
[15:02.930 --> 15:04.950]  if you saw the basketball clip.
[15:05.090 --> 15:05.950]  That's where we left you.
[15:06.470 --> 15:07.850]  Yeah, I was talking about how you...
[15:08.370 --> 15:09.230]  Oh, never mind.
[15:13.150 --> 15:13.630]  Okay.
[15:15.930 --> 15:16.410]  Interesting.
[15:16.970 --> 15:20.010]  Can't Hardly Wait is an ensemble cast
[15:20.010 --> 15:22.870]  with Seth Green, Jennifer Love Hewitt,
[15:23.310 --> 15:25.550]  Ethan Embry, and a bunch of other people.
[15:25.550 --> 15:28.130]  That were in movies in the 90s,
[15:28.230 --> 15:29.990]  and then the year 2000 happened,
[15:30.190 --> 15:31.450]  and none of them were in movies anymore.
[15:31.650 --> 15:32.010]  Okay.
[15:32.410 --> 15:33.350]  Yeah, yeah.
[15:33.670 --> 15:34.550]  It's very...
[15:34.550 --> 15:35.170]  It's their last hurrah.
[15:35.470 --> 15:37.050]  Yeah, very like teen comedy,
[15:37.490 --> 15:39.150]  with like, the cast is huge.
[15:39.450 --> 15:41.590]  The cast is like so big, but...
[15:42.050 --> 15:43.150]  Yeah, I think it was just,
[15:43.230 --> 15:44.630]  it's a movie that I was the right age for
[15:44.630 --> 15:45.730]  when it came out, so...
[15:45.730 --> 15:46.010]  Anyway.
[15:47.670 --> 15:49.530]  Andrew, do you want to read our list of selects?
[15:49.750 --> 15:52.230]  Okay, so we're down to our 15 now.
[15:52.330 --> 15:54.810]  We have Blade, Dirty Work, A Perfect Murder,
[15:54.810 --> 15:58.570]  Truman Show, Basekeball, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels,
[15:58.710 --> 16:00.990]  Return to Paradise, The X-Files, Small Soldiers,
[16:01.350 --> 16:03.210]  Saving Private Ryan, Halloween H20,
[16:03.450 --> 16:04.950]  Six Days, Seven Nights, Armageddon,
[16:05.350 --> 16:06.770]  Can't Hardly Wait, and Snake Eyes.
[16:07.230 --> 16:10.190]  Do we want to look at the remaining list of films
[16:10.190 --> 16:11.290]  that we're about to get rid of?
[16:11.750 --> 16:13.290]  Yeah, I don't care about the remaining list,
[16:13.430 --> 16:14.030]  but we can if we want to.
[16:14.030 --> 16:14.230]  The losers?
[16:14.430 --> 16:15.830]  Well, yeah, let's go back to...
[16:15.830 --> 16:17.670]  Let's look at the losers, but like,
[16:17.710 --> 16:19.910]  is there anything like maybe somebody wanted picked
[16:19.910 --> 16:21.090]  that didn't end up getting picked,
[16:21.170 --> 16:22.430]  or that they thought would make it,
[16:22.490 --> 16:23.450]  that didn't make it?
[16:23.450 --> 16:25.750]  100% thought that you were going to say
[16:25.750 --> 16:26.710]  Air Bud Golden Receiver.
[16:26.890 --> 16:27.250]  I absolutely thought that.
[16:27.250 --> 16:27.870]  If that helps.
[16:28.030 --> 16:30.210]  I absolutely thought you were going to pick that.
[16:30.730 --> 16:32.830]  I will say I would like to give some shine
[16:32.830 --> 16:34.330]  to Wrongfully Accused,
[16:34.450 --> 16:38.050]  which is a Leslie Nielsen naked gun style comedy.
[16:38.710 --> 16:40.510]  I think it is hilarious.
[16:40.870 --> 16:41.950]  It's really high up on my list.
[16:42.670 --> 16:45.190]  And they just don't make movies like that anymore.
[16:45.570 --> 16:45.810]  It's true.
[16:45.950 --> 16:47.650]  It's impressive, like, the joke,
[16:47.770 --> 16:49.930]  every scene has at least one joke in it.
[16:50.030 --> 16:50.210]  Yeah.
[16:50.350 --> 16:52.190]  I'd say it's like probably a seven second average.
[16:52.190 --> 16:53.670]  And for me at least,
[16:53.850 --> 16:55.810]  a lot of it landed in Wrongfully Accused.
[16:55.910 --> 16:57.590]  And I just think Leslie Nielsen is so funny.
[16:58.070 --> 17:00.390]  But I think that that's the beginning of the end.
[17:00.610 --> 17:02.690]  Like Leslie Nielsen like ushered that era in
[17:02.690 --> 17:03.690]  and also out.
[17:04.150 --> 17:06.990]  I think that was actually after he started Arrow.
[17:07.290 --> 17:09.010]  It may have been like a bright spot
[17:09.010 --> 17:10.850]  on an otherwise ending era.
[17:10.930 --> 17:11.090]  Yes.
[17:11.130 --> 17:11.290]  Yeah.
[17:11.630 --> 17:12.410]  Because it's like that,
[17:12.510 --> 17:14.190]  like Dracula dead and loving it.
[17:14.290 --> 17:14.830]  You know what I mean?
[17:15.050 --> 17:15.230]  Yeah.
[17:16.030 --> 17:16.590]  Nobody saw.
[17:17.150 --> 17:18.750]  Those old movies like that,
[17:18.990 --> 17:21.590]  where their JPMs are just off the charts.
[17:21.590 --> 17:23.150]  We don't make film like that anymore.
[17:23.310 --> 17:25.110]  I think that's why I like baseball
[17:25.110 --> 17:26.390]  because it's definitely that vibe.
[17:26.530 --> 17:28.030]  It's the same people I think as Naked Gun.
[17:29.650 --> 17:31.650]  I'm surprised by one film that didn't make it,
[17:31.710 --> 17:32.050]  I'll say.
[17:32.230 --> 17:33.270]  And that's Out of Sight.
[17:33.530 --> 17:35.850]  Just because that was a huge film when it came out.
[17:35.990 --> 17:36.170]  Yeah.
[17:37.070 --> 17:37.610]  It was like,
[17:37.970 --> 17:39.810]  I just remember everybody losing their shit over it.
[17:39.850 --> 17:40.430]  I saw it.
[17:40.430 --> 17:41.170]  I thought it was okay.
[17:41.350 --> 17:41.890]  I didn't get it.
[17:41.910 --> 17:44.270]  But everybody was in love with George Clooney
[17:44.270 --> 17:48.090]  and J-Lo being in love.
[17:48.930 --> 17:51.430]  That was the only thing that I know about that movie.
[17:51.430 --> 17:54.170]  Is that they are in the movie.
[17:54.810 --> 17:55.390]  There's a scene,
[17:55.470 --> 17:56.630]  I remember this one scene
[17:56.630 --> 17:58.710]  because it always got quoted and played.
[17:59.090 --> 18:00.110]  But it was Jennifer Lopez going,
[18:00.330 --> 18:01.290]  You wanted to tussle?
[18:01.670 --> 18:02.350]  We tussled.
[18:05.430 --> 18:11.150]  It definitely was the only marketing in that movie.
[18:11.390 --> 18:12.650]  Hang on, I just searched for it.
[18:12.810 --> 18:13.450]  And it's just,
[18:13.690 --> 18:15.530]  No, no, we gonna tussle first.
[18:16.470 --> 18:17.430]  Yeah, there you go.
[18:20.850 --> 18:21.890]  That sucks.
[18:22.330 --> 18:23.550]  Yeah, it sucked.
[18:24.090 --> 18:24.830]  Oh my God.
[18:25.370 --> 18:28.750]  Gavin, anything on here that you're surprised didn't make it?
[18:29.070 --> 18:29.830]  Anything left over?
[18:30.370 --> 18:30.550]  Yeah.
[18:31.410 --> 18:32.090]  I don't think so.
[18:32.790 --> 18:36.170]  I will say people have a real fondness for There's Something About Mary.
[18:36.430 --> 18:38.110]  I don't necessarily.
[18:38.830 --> 18:40.690]  It doesn't hold up in my viewing.
[18:40.870 --> 18:43.930]  I had watched it for the first time as part of this experience.
[18:43.930 --> 18:48.250]  The only scene that stood out to me is still being really funny is when,
[18:48.710 --> 18:50.030]  and I'm blanking on his name.
[18:50.150 --> 18:51.110]  He's a stand-up comedian.
[18:51.270 --> 18:51.870]  He has one scene.
[18:51.970 --> 18:52.830]  He plays a hitchhiker.
[18:53.290 --> 18:54.190]  Harlan Ellison.
[18:54.490 --> 18:55.690]  Yeah, him.
[18:56.090 --> 18:56.730]  He pitches.
[18:56.890 --> 18:58.290]  There's like a six-minute ab scene.
[18:58.790 --> 18:59.570]  I thought that was funny.
[18:59.630 --> 19:00.870]  But outside of that, nothing really.
[19:01.010 --> 19:06.550]  But that was like an homage to his old scene in Dumb and Dumber,
[19:06.670 --> 19:07.850]  which was so much funnier,
[19:07.910 --> 19:10.770]  where he's the cop who drinks the piss in the beer bottle, you know?
[19:14.150 --> 19:15.410]  Isn't Lee Evans in that?
[19:16.170 --> 19:16.450]  Mm-hmm.
[19:17.270 --> 19:17.730]  He is.
[19:17.870 --> 19:20.630]  Yeah, he plays an American, which is odd.
[19:21.150 --> 19:24.330]  Although he plays like an American playing a Brit, though, doesn't he, for a while?
[19:25.010 --> 19:27.110]  Yes, he starts out as just a Brit,
[19:27.230 --> 19:29.650]  and then it's revealed that his name is like Randy or something,
[19:29.790 --> 19:31.170]  and he's a pizza delivery guy.
[19:31.610 --> 19:33.970]  Lee Evans is a huge stand-up in the UK,
[19:34.110 --> 19:37.330]  and he just had a run in the 90s where he was just in so many movies.
[19:37.430 --> 19:38.590]  It's so weird to see him and stuff.
[19:38.950 --> 19:41.270]  Like Mouse Hunt and Fifth Element and stuff.
[19:41.770 --> 19:42.450]  Mouse Hunt.
[19:42.450 --> 19:44.410]  Mouse Hunt is just so fucking great.
[19:44.630 --> 19:46.530]  Mouse Hunt is a phenomenal movie.
[19:46.650 --> 19:48.030]  I don't give a shit what you say.
[19:48.250 --> 19:49.330]  I'm right there with you, dude.
[19:49.430 --> 19:50.110]  Right there with you.
[19:50.150 --> 19:52.390]  Mouse Hunt and Rat Race I'll watch all day long.
[19:53.330 --> 19:56.050]  You're into just like rodent-themed films?
[19:56.970 --> 19:59.550]  No, I'm into that kind of film.
[19:59.770 --> 20:01.810]  That kind of ensemble, funny, silly film.
[20:02.750 --> 20:04.370]  By the way, I said his name was Harlan Ellison.
[20:04.470 --> 20:05.250]  It's Harlan Williams.
[20:05.390 --> 20:06.270]  Harlan Williams, yeah.
[20:06.830 --> 20:08.210]  Harlan Ellison's a much older actor.
[20:08.430 --> 20:09.230]  Yes, he is.
[20:10.250 --> 20:12.410]  Okay, I feel good about the list.
[20:12.670 --> 20:18.210]  Okay, so how do we want to sort of approach this?
[20:18.810 --> 20:20.970]  There are many ways this can go.
[20:22.950 --> 20:25.710]  There are films on here that I think...
[20:25.710 --> 20:29.670]  Like, I don't want to call anyone out, but there's certain films I don't think are great.
[20:30.090 --> 20:30.990]  Pull me out, do it.
[20:31.330 --> 20:33.250]  You pick Small Soldiers, go ahead and let us know.
[20:33.250 --> 20:34.750]  Yeah, no, I know, but I was...
[20:34.750 --> 20:37.890]  In reference, I was four in 98.
[20:37.890 --> 20:41.090]  I watched Small Soldiers as like a five-year-old.
[20:41.470 --> 20:43.950]  And as a kid, it was one of my favorites.
[20:44.110 --> 20:45.310]  I'd watch it all the time.
[20:45.690 --> 20:47.070]  I think there's some great voice work.
[20:47.470 --> 20:50.270]  The ending of that movie is fucking insane.
[20:50.570 --> 20:54.470]  There is a thing that is burnt into my brain about that movie,
[20:54.470 --> 20:58.210]  where the toys create this gun that fires AV cables.
[20:58.810 --> 21:02.010]  And I want to say it's like Phil Hartman, it's one of the main characters,
[21:02.010 --> 21:07.890]  gets shot in the leg like four times with AV cables and it like pierces his leg like bullets.
[21:08.390 --> 21:09.150]  Like, it's crazy.
[21:09.530 --> 21:11.110]  That movie is an insane finale.
[21:11.870 --> 21:17.050]  I understand why maybe it would get cut, but it is something for me.
[21:17.110 --> 21:21.290]  I mean, if we want to talk about things that might get cut, Snake Eyes, I think...
[21:21.290 --> 21:22.570]  What's wrong with Snake Eyes?
[21:22.850 --> 21:25.570]  It is such an average film.
[21:25.930 --> 21:31.030]  Like, it is just like the definition of like totally decent cable movie.
[21:31.030 --> 21:35.210]  Like, it's a movie that when you're channel surfing, you'll watch 30 minutes of if it's on.
[21:35.570 --> 21:38.150]  But like, you're not... nobody's pumped about Snake Eyes.
[21:38.430 --> 21:40.170]  Okay, I will say that...
[21:40.930 --> 21:42.370]  Uh-oh, Gary Sinise is in it?
[21:42.670 --> 21:43.710]  Oh, he's good in it.
[21:43.850 --> 21:44.710]  He's really good in it.
[21:44.790 --> 21:52.070]  I will say that I have watched Snake Eyes mostly on cable in 30-minute chunks.
[21:52.290 --> 21:52.510]  Yes!
[21:52.770 --> 21:57.790]  So, I will concede that point.
[21:57.790 --> 22:02.070]  However, I don't think that takes it off the top 10.
[22:02.410 --> 22:07.190]  I think that Snake Eyes is a very serviceable like number 8 film.
[22:07.570 --> 22:10.390]  Can I throw one out there that we could get rid of?
[22:10.430 --> 22:10.770]  Sure.
[22:11.150 --> 22:11.950]  We start the lobbying.
[22:12.750 --> 22:14.790]  This is going to seem out of left field and...
[22:15.330 --> 22:16.690]  Actually, I'll explain it like this.
[22:17.590 --> 22:18.110]  I...
[22:18.110 --> 22:22.330]  The movie The X-Files Fight the Future came out on my birthday.
[22:22.910 --> 22:23.970]  June 19th, 1998.
[22:24.570 --> 22:25.650]  I was living in New Jersey.
[22:25.650 --> 22:28.670]  My friends and I were very, very, very excited.
[22:28.990 --> 22:29.570]  The X-Files...
[22:29.570 --> 22:32.110]  You guys were a little younger, so it may not have...
[22:32.110 --> 22:34.890]  You may not have experienced it in the time like I did.
[22:35.190 --> 22:39.230]  But The X-Files was kind of a very cultural zeitgeist film.
[22:39.390 --> 22:39.970]  It was...
[22:39.970 --> 22:40.730]  It had a huge...
[22:41.330 --> 22:42.610]  I'm sorry, television show.
[22:42.830 --> 22:46.670]  It had a huge following, a lot of love, a lot of enthusiasm for it.
[22:47.050 --> 22:49.090]  And we...
[22:49.090 --> 22:51.950]  It was like prime appointment viewing.
[22:52.070 --> 22:55.230]  You would be home to watch the new episode of X-Files.
[22:55.230 --> 22:59.450]  So that they could edge you and you'd be disappointed because they would never...
[22:59.450 --> 23:01.790]  They would never address the larger story.
[23:01.950 --> 23:05.310]  They did this thing where they would have 20 episode seasons or 22 episode seasons.
[23:05.610 --> 23:10.250]  The first two episodes would reference the overall story, the overall plot.
[23:11.010 --> 23:14.170]  The 11th and 12th episode would, like the mid-season break.
[23:14.290 --> 23:17.830]  And then the 19th and 20th or the 21st and 22nd episode would.
[23:18.030 --> 23:19.430]  And all the other episodes were filler.
[23:19.830 --> 23:24.830]  And so you had to go through a whole fucking season to get like maybe four episodes where they were advancing the actual storyline.
[23:24.830 --> 23:33.870]  X-Files Fight the Future promised to address that and fill in the gaps and advance the storyline in a way they couldn't on television.
[23:34.470 --> 23:37.170]  And so we were all extremely excited about it.
[23:37.370 --> 23:41.870]  There was a 9 a.m. showing the day it came out, but it was an hour and a half away.
[23:41.970 --> 23:51.030]  So my friends and I all got up at like 6 a.m. and drove an hour and a half deep into New Jersey to go to this special theater that was showing it at 9 a.m.
[23:51.030 --> 23:52.190]  We were the only people in the theater.
[23:52.290 --> 23:53.530]  We were afraid we wouldn't be able to get in.
[23:53.530 --> 23:56.150]  Apparently we were the only people that were that excited about it.
[23:56.250 --> 23:58.890]  And then that movie did not deliver in any way.
[23:59.210 --> 24:00.630]  And it really bummed me out.
[24:01.490 --> 24:04.870]  I'm sorry. Can I make the case for the X-Files?
[24:04.990 --> 24:05.670]  Like that sucks.
[24:05.810 --> 24:07.050]  Like I'm sorry you had that experience.
[24:07.390 --> 24:08.870]  It's just they didn't answer the questions.
[24:09.030 --> 24:09.790]  They didn't solve.
[24:09.970 --> 24:12.110]  They said they were going to like prove that aliens existed.
[24:12.310 --> 24:13.550]  And then they didn't.
[24:13.610 --> 24:15.670]  And then they referenced it like they did.
[24:16.150 --> 24:21.670]  No, there's like a scene where you think a UFO flies away, but nobody else sees it but Mulder.
[24:21.670 --> 24:24.770]  And then you're like, so the world doesn't know, right?
[24:24.810 --> 24:27.570]  So you didn't really do anything other than you confirmed that aliens existed.
[24:27.650 --> 24:33.490]  He already fucking knew aliens existed since his sister got kidnapped in the first fucking episode that we've been dealing with for like eight fucking years.
[24:33.930 --> 24:38.170]  It was such a limp dick fucking way to handle that.
[24:38.870 --> 24:41.910]  And then the next season, I'm like, well, I can't wait to see what happens the next season.
[24:42.150 --> 24:45.910]  First episode comes up, fucking Scully goes to Mulder and goes, well, what do you want to do now?
[24:45.930 --> 24:47.270]  You already proved that aliens exist.
[24:47.350 --> 24:50.430]  And it's like, you didn't prove aliens exist to anybody but you, asshole.
[24:50.430 --> 24:52.270]  Nobody else in the world knows aliens exist.
[24:52.350 --> 24:54.310]  Where the fuck is the, like, come on.
[24:54.410 --> 24:58.210]  The rest of the government's still like, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about, creepy Mulder.
[24:58.470 --> 24:59.270]  Aliens don't exist.
[24:59.410 --> 25:00.350]  Like, it was bullshit.
[25:00.470 --> 25:02.210]  It was such a fucking bait-and-switch.
[25:02.450 --> 25:04.090]  Anyway, if you guys like it, that's fine.
[25:04.390 --> 25:08.050]  Well, no, this is, from my perspective, I had never seen The X-Files.
[25:08.150 --> 25:12.070]  Like, it was something that, as I was a kid growing up, it was so, like, cultural.
[25:12.210 --> 25:13.350]  It was just part of the culture.
[25:13.730 --> 25:17.130]  I never watched it because I was too scared of the intro of the show.
[25:17.390 --> 25:18.910]  It would genuinely creep me out.
[25:18.910 --> 25:21.410]  I'd, like, run out of the room if I ever heard it.
[25:21.710 --> 25:25.930]  So, I went into this never seeing anything related to The X-Files.
[25:26.150 --> 25:28.190]  I was so, like, out of the loop.
[25:28.430 --> 25:31.450]  I thought the characters' names were Muldry and Sully.
[25:31.630 --> 25:33.090]  And I thought he was Sully.
[25:33.770 --> 25:38.430]  I was, like, not only were the names wrong, they were applied to the wrong people.
[25:38.670 --> 25:40.090]  Like, I was just completely off.
[25:40.450 --> 25:46.050]  And in the movie, it's baffling because I assumed, like, going in, I thought that, okay, the show is done.
[25:46.050 --> 25:49.070]  And they've now released this big movie at the end of it.
[25:49.150 --> 25:54.890]  And so, I'm watching it, and they're talking about how, like, they need to still confirm aliens exist.
[25:55.130 --> 26:02.010]  Or there's this tone of, like, that aliens being a thing is not commonly accepted amongst the government.
[26:02.390 --> 26:04.730]  And I thought, what was this fucking show?
[26:04.970 --> 26:09.590]  Like, I assumed every episode of the show was them dealing with an alien situation.
[26:09.850 --> 26:13.190]  Like, it was baffling to me that that was a thing that had yet to be confirmed.
[26:13.190 --> 26:19.670]  What was even crazier to me was learning that this was not at the end of the series.
[26:19.990 --> 26:25.810]  That the movie is, like, the bridge between season 5 and season 6.
[26:26.110 --> 26:33.130]  Which is insane when you think about the context of what TV viewing was in the 90s.
[26:33.410 --> 26:35.030]  There is no video on demand.
[26:35.530 --> 26:41.550]  Like, there is no... if you missed the episode and you didn't happen to record it, there is no way to see it.
[26:41.550 --> 26:44.990]  So you're basically asking people to remember what happened in those seasons.
[26:45.630 --> 26:52.090]  But, as somebody who was an adult in that time frame, that's just how the world worked and we all understood it and we played by the rules.
[26:52.590 --> 26:52.810]  Exactly.
[26:53.510 --> 26:56.730]  No, like, seriously. That's why appointment viewing was appointment viewing.
[26:57.090 --> 27:01.170]  Everybody had to be home to watch Buffy or X-Files or whatever when it came on.
[27:01.290 --> 27:04.710]  Because if you missed it, you had to hope you could catch it in summer reruns.
[27:05.170 --> 27:05.410]  Yeah.
[27:05.410 --> 27:12.470]  And so, people put a lot more weight into... like, people prioritized TV in a different way back then because it wasn't available like it is now.
[27:12.870 --> 27:18.650]  I suggested that... well, I talked to you, Geoff, about Chuck Klosterman, who is one of my favorite writers. He wrote a book about the 90s.
[27:18.890 --> 27:20.470]  Yeah, great book. I read that, by the way.
[27:20.730 --> 27:22.990]  Yeah, I'm going through it right now. That's sort of what they talk about.
[27:23.070 --> 27:34.550]  Like, if you missed a show in the 90s and you didn't record it, you're essentially only option to see it is to go to an archive in New York or Los Angeles and schedule a personal recording.
[27:34.550 --> 27:34.950]  No.
[27:35.210 --> 27:36.150]  Or viewing of it.
[27:36.250 --> 27:39.990]  I mean, that's why I started praying for the episode of The Mosque to come back on.
[27:40.290 --> 27:40.930]  Oh, that's right.
[27:41.310 --> 27:46.770]  Yeah. And by the way, nobody's doing that. What Chuck is describing there is what journalists do when they need to research or something.
[27:47.170 --> 27:47.350]  Yes.
[27:47.350 --> 27:49.590]  Most normal human beings just wait for summer reruns.
[27:49.650 --> 27:53.630]  Yeah, that was just not part of, like, if you missed it, who cares, was sort of the sentiment at the time.
[27:53.630 --> 28:05.430]  So just to me, the notion that they would be willing to, like, intersect seasons of a show with a movie under the expectation that you saw all the show post and after, like, that's just wild.
[28:05.830 --> 28:07.190]  But it was a safe assumption.
[28:07.630 --> 28:09.550]  Sure. Yeah. And it did extremely well.
[28:09.910 --> 28:15.930]  Which is why I was so, that's why I looked into it, because I was like, wow, this is one of the highest grossing movies in the summer of 98.
[28:16.670 --> 28:24.070]  Why didn't they do a sequel? And then realizing, oh, they made like 10 more seasons or like five more seasons of a show post it airing.
[28:24.130 --> 28:32.810]  I just think it's such a cultural, like, for me, it's a weird factor of, like, what is a good movie and what is a good summer of 98 movie?
[28:33.330 --> 28:34.970]  Like, they're different measurements.
[28:35.510 --> 28:42.470]  So I think my argument for having the X-Files in the top 10 is it is so 98. It is so the summer of 98.
[28:42.470 --> 28:45.570]  I mean, it was an event. I drove an hour and a half to go see it.
[28:45.630 --> 28:49.330]  So you have to I just I just found the movie to be such a fucking letdown.
[28:49.450 --> 28:52.270]  And all my friends did, too. We were all just like, we just felt like we'd been duped.
[28:52.410 --> 28:53.550]  And it was so depressing.
[28:53.850 --> 28:54.590]  Yeah, totally fair.
[28:54.810 --> 28:58.090]  No less. I think I turned 23 that year.
[28:58.730 --> 29:02.370]  Oh, no. That sucks. Like, I get it.
[29:02.490 --> 29:05.190]  It was four months. It was three months before I moved back to Austin.
[29:05.350 --> 29:10.110]  Who knows? That movie may have been so bad that it may have colored my opinion of New Jersey.
[29:10.110 --> 29:12.790]  It may have been part of why I left New Jersey to come back to Texas.
[29:13.130 --> 29:16.990]  In that respect, if that's true, then we should put it on the list because it gave me a career.
[29:17.190 --> 29:22.550]  What about instead of, like, picking apart what we we think should be cut?
[29:22.670 --> 29:25.450]  Are there movies that we feel definitely will be on the list?
[29:25.930 --> 29:28.530]  Like, I feel Truman Show definitely on the list.
[29:28.650 --> 29:30.390]  I think I think Truman Show is on the list.
[29:30.690 --> 29:32.730]  Saving Private Ryan, I think, is definitely on the list.
[29:32.870 --> 29:35.430]  Yeah, I think I think Lockstock has got to be on the list.
[29:35.590 --> 29:39.210]  Really? I feel like I feel like Lockstock is like a lesser snatch.
[29:39.750 --> 29:42.110]  Like, I feel like Lockstock is fun for what it is.
[29:42.110 --> 29:43.470]  But it made so many people though.
[29:43.730 --> 29:46.170]  Yeah, and there wouldn't have been a snatch if it wasn't for Lockstock.
[29:46.310 --> 29:48.090]  Lockstock was a huge deal when it came out.
[29:48.090 --> 29:53.430]  It's a great movie. I just think like it's when compared to like his work that follows, not as good.
[29:53.450 --> 29:57.430]  But that hasn't happened yet because we're in the summer of 98. Those things don't exist.
[29:57.510 --> 30:00.030]  How can you compare it against things that haven't been?
[30:00.190 --> 30:04.550]  Well, I'm evaluating based on my perspective now because I was four in the summer.
[30:05.850 --> 30:06.570]  I can't.
[30:06.770 --> 30:09.570]  You weren't a big Vinny Jones fan when you were four?
[30:10.110 --> 30:14.390]  I wasn't. No, that was later. Mean Machine? Great Vinny Jones movie.
[30:14.830 --> 30:20.730]  I remember finding it so weird that a footballer was in a film. That was just unreal to me at the time.
[30:21.150 --> 30:24.810]  Wait, what do you mean? What do you mean? Is Vinny? Is that? Was he a footballer?
[30:25.070 --> 30:27.010]  Yeah, he was a Premier League footballer.
[30:27.090 --> 30:28.450]  What? I didn't know that.
[30:28.450 --> 30:30.390]  You didn't know that? Are you serious?
[30:31.350 --> 30:34.690]  And then when he was in X-Men, I was like, what is happening?
[30:35.130 --> 30:37.430]  Wait, wait, wait, what? What is happening?
[30:38.090 --> 30:41.650]  I had no idea about that. I didn't know. What? That's fucking crazy.
[30:42.550 --> 30:47.510]  He was a Jones played professionally as a defensive midfielder from 1984 to 1999.
[30:48.350 --> 30:50.490]  Yeah. Yep. That's where I knew him from.
[30:51.130 --> 30:58.630]  Dude, I know him from Snatch and Lockstop and Mean Machine and Gone in 60 Seconds.
[30:59.130 --> 31:05.750]  Here's what I'll say. I'll say one last thing just in my, I guess, promoting Lockstock onto the list.
[31:05.890 --> 31:09.250]  The last thing I'll say about is it ushered in a new era of film.
[31:09.430 --> 31:15.010]  Like it created gritty, like funny crime, hardboiled crime movies again.
[31:15.330 --> 31:20.450]  It was like it literally launched that whole genre that was pretty healthy for about 15 years.
[31:20.870 --> 31:22.170]  What about like Reservoir Dogs?
[31:22.410 --> 31:26.810]  Like I feel like the thing people say about Guy Ritchie is he's just knocking off Quentin Tarantino.
[31:26.810 --> 31:28.130]  Like that style of movie.
[31:28.470 --> 31:30.230]  I don't see that at all. I think they're very different.
[31:30.230 --> 31:30.810]  You don't feel that way? Okay.
[31:31.130 --> 31:31.270]  No.
[31:31.370 --> 31:35.210]  The guy I used to work with too also did the slow-mo on Lockstock.
[31:35.350 --> 31:38.530]  There's like a Photosonics film slow-mo shot at the beginning.
[31:38.770 --> 31:43.730]  Like one of the reasons we got put on like Sherlock Holmes and stuff was because he did that.
[31:45.390 --> 31:46.270]  Ah. That's cool.
[31:46.370 --> 31:53.130]  I think, I think of what we have here, I think we could probably, I think it could be one that we consider to be on the list.
[31:53.130 --> 31:57.310]  I think it's on, if Andrew's not totally sold on it, I think it's on the bubble.
[31:57.450 --> 32:01.130]  But are there any other ones? Like I think Armageddon should definitely be on the list.
[32:01.230 --> 32:02.570]  Armageddon should definitely be on the list.
[32:02.970 --> 32:04.110]  Right? Okay.
[32:07.010 --> 32:07.730]  Dirty Work?
[32:07.950 --> 32:08.310]  Yes!
[32:08.350 --> 32:09.470]  I think Dirty Work is on the list.
[32:09.470 --> 32:09.830]  Yes!
[32:09.830 --> 32:11.390]  I think Dirty Work is on the list.
[32:11.510 --> 32:12.930]  I think Blade is on the list.
[32:13.410 --> 32:13.670]  I think Blade is on the list.
[32:13.670 --> 32:14.130]  Yes, Blade.
[32:14.250 --> 32:15.770]  I think Blade is on the list as well.
[32:16.110 --> 32:18.350]  I also think Basketball is on the list.
[32:18.490 --> 32:18.830]  I agree.
[32:19.010 --> 32:20.150]  Oh, thank God.
[32:21.930 --> 32:30.810]  Blade had the best fucking, Blade had the best action star line ever, that I've ever seen in a film.
[32:31.230 --> 32:37.230]  After, after Wesley Snipes kills, what is it, Stephen Dorff, I believe, is who the bad guy is.
[32:37.390 --> 32:44.210]  After he kills him, and he kicks his ass or whatever, he goes, some motherfucker's always trying to ice skate uphill.
[32:44.970 --> 32:47.670]  That is the coolest fucking, he improv'd that dude.
[32:47.830 --> 32:49.330]  That is the coolest fucking thing to say.
[32:49.330 --> 32:49.890]  Yep.
[32:50.910 --> 33:02.450]  I think it's like, it's just such a cool, it's such a cool line, in such a cool movie, from such a cool character, that like, it makes it.
[33:02.770 --> 33:08.490]  It totally, you're able to walk away and go like, I remember that one fucking part. Like, that's the coolest shit in the world.
[33:08.910 --> 33:09.230]  Also,
[33:09.270 --> 33:09.970]  And it helps it a lot.
[33:09.970 --> 33:21.970]  There was another thing where, uh, Dona Logue is in that movie, and before it came out, he was, he had kind of become famous for an independent film that came out called The Dow of Steve.
[33:22.170 --> 33:22.530]  Oh yeah.
[33:22.550 --> 33:34.990]  Where he was like a really, he was like a school teacher, I want to say, um, and it's an independent film, but he's a really like, soft, likable, sweet guy, and he, everybody kind of fell in love with him as that character.
[33:35.170 --> 33:39.370]  And then Blade starts, and he's got a fucking knife in his hand, and he's like,
[33:39.370 --> 33:42.330]  I stuck him, I stuck him with my pig sticker!
[33:42.670 --> 33:47.810]  And you're like, what the fuck? This is a totally different dude, he's wearing like, leather and shit, and that was like, that was an awesome reveal.
[33:48.270 --> 33:55.130]  Yep, I think his intro to that movie is him in a blood rave, getting a double blowjob in like a shower stall.
[33:55.490 --> 33:55.730]  Oh yeah.
[33:56.170 --> 34:02.210]  One of the best intros to any movie, I would say. Like, I think about the Blade intro all the time.
[34:02.650 --> 34:08.170]  This is one of those things that would be hard for us to do, but we should do a best movie intro ever draft, cause I've got strong opinions.
[34:10.810 --> 34:15.390]  Okay, I'm gonna say that's a cool idea, and we should finish this one first.
[34:15.550 --> 34:15.690]  Yes.
[34:16.090 --> 34:16.810]  Let's do that.
[34:17.510 --> 34:20.990]  You don't want to put pause on this and then immediately go rehearse and then film that?
[34:21.390 --> 34:21.890]  Uh, no.
[34:22.210 --> 34:28.770]  I'm gonna leave this video in Discord for us to watch later, it's just a compilation of Vinny Jones fouling people in the premiere.
[34:30.850 --> 34:31.630]  That's awesome.
[34:32.110 --> 34:34.210]  Can I share my embarrassing Vinny Jones fandom?
[34:34.730 --> 34:34.970]  Yeah.
[34:34.970 --> 34:40.450]  When I was like 12 or 13, I'm gonna post it in the chat right now, a poster for this movie.
[34:40.630 --> 34:47.830]  I thought this was the coolest action movie of all time, and looking back on it, it is so embarrassing, it is so cringy.
[34:47.910 --> 34:58.590]  The film is called Blast. It is an Eddie Griffin-led action comedy with Breckin Meyer as his co-star, and Vinny Jones plays the villain in it.
[34:58.830 --> 35:03.810]  It is so bad. But at the time, as a kid, I thought it was the coolest fucking movie.
[35:03.810 --> 35:06.410]  When did Blast come out?
[35:06.710 --> 35:09.890]  It was like, I would say mid-thousands, mid-2000s.
[35:10.890 --> 35:12.530]  I mean, if Breckin Meyer isn't it.
[35:13.610 --> 35:14.130]  2004.
[35:15.070 --> 35:23.150]  It was made by a studio and a company that specifically would make DVD fodder for Blockbuster, like that was entirely their business.
[35:23.690 --> 35:32.170]  It is an obscure film that I love that is so cringy now, just knowing how cool I thought it was when it is so bad. It's so cheesy.
[35:32.170 --> 35:36.590]  I think I only ever saw Eddie Griffin in Undercover Brother.
[35:38.910 --> 35:52.210]  There's a scene in this movie where Eddie Griffin soccer kicks a grenade, like he does the back jump, soccer kicks a grenade, and then stands up and says, we're playing soccer in the hood now, and then poses. It is so bad.
[35:53.090 --> 35:56.670]  Can we schedule a viewing and watch that? Because I've never heard of it.
[35:56.830 --> 35:57.910]  I want to watch that so bad.
[35:57.970 --> 36:00.810]  It seems like the perfect next movie for us to watch together.
[36:01.370 --> 36:05.810]  Gracie, can you make a note for that so we can watch Blast?
[36:06.850 --> 36:07.570]  Thank you.
[36:09.150 --> 36:13.190]  Okay, we have that noted. So right now we have six movies that we know are going to make it.
[36:13.510 --> 36:20.970]  Blade, Dirty Work, Truman Show, Basketball, Saving Private Ryan, and Armageddon. Are there any others on here that we feel like will definitely make it?
[36:21.570 --> 36:24.450]  It sounds like you guys really want Lockstock, so I'm fine with that.
[36:24.610 --> 36:25.750]  Well, let's hold off.
[36:26.090 --> 36:29.370]  What if we put Bubble in a different color?
[36:30.210 --> 36:31.930]  I'll do a blue.
[36:33.470 --> 36:37.230]  I'll make the case for Halloween H2O.
[36:38.170 --> 36:42.710]  Because that was another one that was kind of a big deal. We hadn't had a Halloween movie in a while.
[36:42.930 --> 36:50.070]  It was a return of Laurie Strug, and it was another movie that my friends and I eventized.
[36:50.230 --> 36:57.670]  We got so excited about it, we went and we took pictures with all the ushers at the movie theater, and then made a scrapbook out of it later.
[36:57.670 --> 37:05.890]  I will say, I'm fine with it being on the Bubble. I don't particularly like it. I don't think it's a good film.
[37:06.190 --> 37:13.490]  I don't think that it's, even in terms of Halloween, I don't think that it's one that I would ever go back to.
[37:13.770 --> 37:23.070]  However, in the summer of 98, the lead up to that, the marketing for that, it was inescapable.
[37:23.070 --> 37:33.150]  The amount of stuff that I saw for fucking Halloween H2O, that's like a touchstone, like a zeitgeist thing for me.
[37:33.530 --> 37:41.130]  Where I just couldn't get away from it. So, I don't love it. I think on the Bubble is fine.
[37:41.450 --> 37:44.730]  But it's definitely a 1998 thing.
[37:45.030 --> 37:50.010]  It had such a fucking cast. First off, it was I think 20 years since there had been a Halloween movie, right?
[37:50.010 --> 37:55.630]  But it obviously had Jamie Lee Curtis in it. It had Adam Arkin in it. It had Michelle Williams.
[37:55.990 --> 38:00.970]  It had Janet Leigh. LL Cool J was in it. Janet Leigh was in it. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was in it.
[38:01.030 --> 38:02.130]  It was a pretty wild cast.
[38:02.610 --> 38:03.350]  He died by ice cream.
[38:05.030 --> 38:06.710]  Was that Joseph Gordon-Levitt?
[38:07.010 --> 38:07.690]  Yeah, I think so.
[38:08.950 --> 38:10.090]  Josh Hartnett's in it too.
[38:10.350 --> 38:10.470]  What?
[38:13.110 --> 38:14.990]  He's like the main guy. He's like her son.
[38:15.630 --> 38:16.810]  He's like the guy in it.
[38:17.530 --> 38:18.650]  The guy from Oppenheimer?
[38:18.650 --> 38:21.310]  The guy from Oppenheimer is Halloween H2O.
[38:22.050 --> 38:24.330]  Hot Scientist is in Halloween H2O.
[38:25.230 --> 38:25.710]  Wow.
[38:26.710 --> 38:31.410]  The main takeaway, I watched that movie maybe like four or five months ago for the first time.
[38:31.810 --> 38:35.750]  And what I remember is that LL Cool J wrote romantic novels on the side.
[38:35.930 --> 38:38.210]  And that was just like my favorite part of that whole movie.
[38:38.390 --> 38:42.050]  His side story with his wife writing romance novels at work.
[38:42.350 --> 38:47.230]  That was also at the height of LL Cool J the movie actor, which I loved in that era of his career.
[38:47.230 --> 38:48.350]  Oh, some great movies.
[38:48.770 --> 38:49.330]  Deep Blue Sea?
[38:49.750 --> 38:51.530]  Deep Blue Sea is the one. That's the one.
[38:51.870 --> 38:52.830]  That's the one.
[38:53.750 --> 38:54.350]  Charlie's Angels.
[38:57.490 --> 39:02.370]  Okay, any other here that you feel like are bubble movies that you're so-so on?
[39:02.450 --> 39:04.450]  I feel like X-Files is a bubble movie.
[39:04.610 --> 39:04.930]  Yeah.
[39:05.770 --> 39:07.030]  Because I can go either way on it.
[39:07.210 --> 39:09.770]  I get it, but also it really doesn't.
[39:09.850 --> 39:11.510]  It's okay to add it. It's fine.
[39:12.670 --> 39:14.190]  If everybody else is on board.
[39:14.370 --> 39:16.230]  I mean, it was a big deal to me.
[39:16.230 --> 39:20.490]  I'm dealing with the personal disappointment of the film.
[39:21.030 --> 39:23.750]  But that shouldn't affect how successful it was in the theater.
[39:25.490 --> 39:30.570]  So we're at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[39:31.230 --> 39:32.650]  Including our bubble movies here.
[39:33.330 --> 39:36.550]  I would be willing to give up Return to Paradise.
[39:37.310 --> 39:39.370]  It's a movie I watched recently.
[39:39.550 --> 39:40.870]  It's a movie I'd never heard of.
[39:41.290 --> 39:45.570]  And I think the moral hook of that story is really fascinating.
[39:45.570 --> 39:47.990]  And I found it to be an intense watch.
[39:48.150 --> 39:50.850]  But I don't think anyone else outside of Geoff has seen it.
[39:51.270 --> 39:53.570]  So I'm not necessarily going to fight for it to be in the top ten.
[39:53.890 --> 39:56.530]  I just wanted to give it some attention as a movie.
[39:56.990 --> 39:58.250]  It's the Joaquin Phoenix one, right?
[39:58.590 --> 40:02.190]  Yeah, it's Joaquin Phoenix, Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche.
[40:02.790 --> 40:05.490]  All I remember is Joaquin Phoenix with long hair.
[40:06.330 --> 40:10.650]  So the premise of the movie is it's like Vince Vaughn and Joaquin Phoenix and this other guy
[40:10.650 --> 40:14.830]  are in Malaysia to just get fucked up, essentially, and party all summer.
[40:14.830 --> 40:16.950]  And so they become friends and they do that.
[40:17.390 --> 40:21.130]  And then Vince Vaughn and the other guy leave and Joaquin Phoenix is going to leave a little bit later.
[40:21.710 --> 40:24.850]  And then two years pass and they don't keep in touch at all.
[40:24.970 --> 40:27.250]  You know, it's like you have those friendships that work that way.
[40:27.490 --> 40:32.390]  And then a lawyer gets in Vince Vaughn's car and tells Vince Vaughn that the day they left,
[40:32.550 --> 40:35.290]  the police came because they rented a bike that they didn't return.
[40:35.550 --> 40:36.790]  And the guy wanted it back.
[40:36.890 --> 40:40.750]  And they found, like, over a hundred grams of hash in the place they were living at.
[40:40.750 --> 40:45.350]  And that the Joaquin Phoenix character has been in prison for the past two years.
[40:45.950 --> 40:51.730]  And that unless some of them are willing to come back, he will be hung in eight days.
[40:52.350 --> 40:55.210]  And so they have to decide if the two guys that left...
[40:55.210 --> 40:59.030]  If one of them comes back, they will have to serve six years in a Malaysian prison.
[40:59.190 --> 41:01.770]  If they both come back, it'll be three years each.
[41:01.950 --> 41:03.890]  But if they don't, then he will die.
[41:04.370 --> 41:04.770]  Jesus!
[41:04.770 --> 41:09.610]  It's them experiencing the floor falling out of your life.
[41:09.770 --> 41:11.170]  Having no idea any of this happened.
[41:11.570 --> 41:14.410]  And then having a week to decide what you're going to do in this scenario.
[41:15.050 --> 41:15.690]  And if you're comfortable.
[41:15.950 --> 41:18.350]  It brings up so many interesting questions.
[41:18.590 --> 41:21.050]  And I think it's so intense at times.
[41:22.110 --> 41:23.790]  Deliberating what the choice will be.
[41:24.370 --> 41:25.350]  And I had never heard of it.
[41:25.530 --> 41:29.010]  So I wanted to give it some attention because I thought it was a really well-made movie.
[41:29.390 --> 41:30.450]  It's a fantastic movie.
[41:31.190 --> 41:34.230]  I feel like Six Days and Seven Nights and Return to Paradise...
[41:34.230 --> 41:36.050]  You gotta pick one or the other. We can't have both.
[41:37.130 --> 41:40.030]  I think Six Days and Seven Nights is just a bad movie, personally.
[41:40.570 --> 41:41.610]  Yeah, you can go ahead.
[41:41.610 --> 41:43.110]  Return to Paradise is definitely better.
[41:43.190 --> 41:43.930]  Yeah, take it out back.
[41:46.190 --> 41:47.450]  Take it out back.
[41:48.570 --> 41:49.750]  Put two between its eyes.
[41:50.290 --> 41:53.990]  Wild about Six Days and Seven Nights is Danny Trejo is in it.
[41:54.130 --> 41:55.510]  But he has no dialogue.
[41:56.210 --> 41:59.210]  And what's the name of that actor? He's in Training Day.
[41:59.310 --> 42:00.810]  He's played like every ethnicity.
[42:01.410 --> 42:02.130]  He's a great actor.
[42:02.370 --> 42:03.350]  Oh, I know who you're talking about.
[42:03.350 --> 42:04.350]  What's his name?
[42:04.450 --> 42:05.810]  I think he's a New Zealand actor.
[42:05.970 --> 42:07.450]  He's been in so many things.
[42:07.550 --> 42:08.390]  He's in Sunshine.
[42:08.630 --> 42:09.650]  He's in Training Day.
[42:10.410 --> 42:12.070]  Is it Cliff Curtis?
[42:12.410 --> 42:13.350]  Cliff Curtis, yeah.
[42:13.530 --> 42:16.650]  He is also in Six Days and Seven Nights with zero dialogue.
[42:16.910 --> 42:18.150]  It was like before he was famous.
[42:18.570 --> 42:22.650]  They play like pirates that attack the main characters on the island.
[42:23.210 --> 42:24.770]  And they have one scene in the whole movie.
[42:24.930 --> 42:25.510]  So it's just...
[42:25.510 --> 42:30.970]  It's wild when you watch it seeing these actors that are notable later that have like zero presence in that film.
[42:30.970 --> 42:38.950]  I think that Can't Hardly Wait is better than Six Days, Seven Nights, Small Soldiers, Return to Paradise and A Perfect Murder.
[42:39.390 --> 42:40.710]  I think Can't Hardly Wait should make it.
[42:41.030 --> 42:44.550]  We are looking at a nine and Can't Hardly Wait.
[42:44.690 --> 42:48.630]  If it's not going to make number eight, I think it could solidly make number ten.
[42:49.170 --> 42:51.430]  I'm happy to eliminate A Perfect Murder.
[42:51.650 --> 42:53.230]  I don't know that anybody else has seen it.
[42:53.330 --> 42:56.510]  And it definitely wasn't like a huge deal when it came out.
[42:56.970 --> 43:00.270]  I think A Perfect Murder is a better version of Snake Eyes.
[43:00.930 --> 43:04.590]  Like I think they're both like fun popcorn cable movies.
[43:04.910 --> 43:10.310]  I will say the wildest thing about Snake Eyes is so many scenes take place in the first person.
[43:10.950 --> 43:11.890]  It's crazy.
[43:12.270 --> 43:15.710]  Like it's such an insane creative choice that doesn't...
[43:15.710 --> 43:18.070]  But I think overall A Perfect Murder is a better movie.
[43:18.850 --> 43:20.270]  Do you think that...
[43:20.270 --> 43:23.590]  But I think Can't Hardly Wait I'd rather put on the list than Snake Eyes.
[43:23.790 --> 43:28.690]  And I would put Can't Hardly Wait above pretty much everything else that hasn't made the list yet.
[43:28.690 --> 43:30.450]  Like 6 Days, 7 Nights, Small Soldiers.
[43:30.570 --> 43:33.190]  I do think Can't Hardly Wait was a big deal.
[43:33.450 --> 43:34.910]  And definitely was like...
[43:35.210 --> 43:38.370]  It was probably the biggest teen summer movie that year.
[43:38.650 --> 43:38.950]  I agree.
[43:39.030 --> 43:40.530]  And like it's one of those...
[43:41.490 --> 43:45.450]  To Eric's generation I guess it's their breakfast club.
[43:46.090 --> 43:49.210]  And so I think it deserves to be on the list.
[43:49.430 --> 43:49.650]  Okay.
[43:49.950 --> 43:52.150]  So Small Soldiers not making the list.
[43:52.630 --> 43:54.430]  Wait a second.
[43:55.730 --> 43:58.090]  You think Small Soldiers belongs on this list.
[43:58.090 --> 44:00.530]  I think Small Soldiers is better than Halloween H20.
[44:01.230 --> 44:02.350]  I would take...
[44:02.350 --> 44:02.930]  Wow.
[44:03.410 --> 44:06.270]  I would take Small Soldiers over Halloween H20.
[44:06.810 --> 44:09.850]  I would take Snake Eyes over Halloween H20.
[44:10.530 --> 44:12.550]  I would take A Perfect Murder over Halloween H20.
[44:12.590 --> 44:15.210]  I would take almost all these movies over Halloween H20.
[44:15.450 --> 44:16.210]  Now we're talking.
[44:16.470 --> 44:17.490]  Now we're talking.
[44:17.710 --> 44:18.530]  See I only...
[44:18.530 --> 44:22.050]  I'm just acquiescing on Halloween H20 just because it was such a touchstone.
[44:22.550 --> 44:23.190]  Like in like the...
[44:23.190 --> 44:24.550]  I just remember so much of it.
[44:24.610 --> 44:25.910]  But I don't like that movie at all.
[44:25.910 --> 44:32.790]  I don't know if this should factor into it but a thing with Halloween H20 was that like Jamie Lee Curtis only agreed to make it.
[44:33.010 --> 44:35.850]  I want to say... and this is going off of memory so I might be slightly wrong on this.
[44:36.150 --> 44:38.590]  But she would only do it if she got to kill Michael Myers.
[44:39.090 --> 44:44.190]  But then the guy that like owned the character forced a change and it caused like this whole drama on set.
[44:44.630 --> 44:46.790]  Because they swap out.
[44:47.310 --> 44:49.990]  So like the Michael Myers character he doesn't...
[44:49.990 --> 44:52.130]  They think they kill him but they don't kill him.
[44:52.250 --> 44:54.830]  Like he switches outfits with somebody at the end.
[44:54.830 --> 44:59.970]  So like their compromise is that the Jamie Lee Curtis character thinks she's killing Michael Myers.
[45:00.090 --> 45:06.350]  But they wanted to continue to make those movies so they set it up so he actually survives and moves on.
[45:06.490 --> 45:08.990]  So I feel like lessens it quite a bit for me.
[45:09.530 --> 45:15.950]  I might just be biased because I am a huge fan of the Halloween franchise and Jamie Lee Curtis in that role.
[45:16.450 --> 45:17.870]  And have watched them all a million times.
[45:18.330 --> 45:22.270]  But it was also... I mean if we're just going off like big summer blockbusters it was a pretty big one.
[45:22.470 --> 45:23.430]  Oh for sure.
[45:23.430 --> 45:28.790]  I always like it when the lead actor wants to drastically have a huge effect on this plotline.
[45:29.290 --> 45:32.790]  Like when Sigourney Weaver was like yeah I want to have sex with the alien though.
[45:35.270 --> 45:35.750]  What?
[45:37.130 --> 45:41.570]  Yeah apparently in Aliens she wanted to like die and bang the alien.
[45:41.830 --> 45:46.010]  And James Cameron was like here's why we shouldn't do that.
[45:46.090 --> 45:47.990]  And then it just happens in like the next movie.
[45:49.190 --> 45:50.150]  Oh no.
[45:51.430 --> 45:54.090]  So are we putting Small Soldiers on the bubble?
[45:54.290 --> 45:56.530]  Gavin do you have any strong feelings about Small Soldiers?
[45:57.030 --> 46:00.990]  I never saw it but I remember being a kid and seeing the ads for it left and right.
[46:01.190 --> 46:03.230]  I'm pretty sure there was some happy meals for it.
[46:03.450 --> 46:04.610]  I feel like it was huge.
[46:05.510 --> 46:10.250]  I felt too old for Small Soldiers in 1998.
[46:11.150 --> 46:13.370]  And I was 12.
[46:14.210 --> 46:15.490]  Yeah I was 10.
[46:15.490 --> 46:21.070]  Yeah it is not a movie that like I have like no love for it whatsoever.
[46:21.190 --> 46:23.070]  Like none really truly.
[46:23.510 --> 46:24.810]  It does nothing for me.
[46:25.230 --> 46:26.410]  I don't find it to be funny.
[46:26.670 --> 46:27.670]  I don't find it to be good.
[46:27.870 --> 46:28.910]  I don't find it to be interesting.
[46:29.190 --> 46:30.430]  It's ugly to look at.
[46:31.090 --> 46:33.290]  I don't like the way anyone moves.
[46:33.630 --> 46:34.950]  I don't like the way anyone looks.
[46:35.150 --> 46:36.830]  I don't enjoy the movie whatsoever.
[46:37.070 --> 46:41.170]  But I am not the only one here so I can't make the call.
[46:41.330 --> 46:44.530]  But that's one that I would like not put on this list.
[46:44.530 --> 46:46.130]  I was 10 so I loved it.
[46:46.450 --> 46:50.490]  I feel all Phil Hartman movies inherently have value.
[46:50.610 --> 46:53.550]  But I'm not gonna simp for fucking Small Soldiers.
[46:53.710 --> 46:54.830]  No it was...
[46:54.830 --> 46:55.370]  Oh no!
[46:55.510 --> 46:56.370]  For me...
[46:56.370 --> 46:58.490]  For me like I had the game.
[46:58.650 --> 46:59.510]  I had the toys.
[46:59.690 --> 47:04.870]  It was also part of at that time period I feel like kids movies that were great with their merchandising.
[47:05.030 --> 47:07.970]  Like between that and Turbo Man.
[47:08.510 --> 47:10.230]  Those were just like jingle all the way.
[47:10.230 --> 47:14.610]  Like such great like I have such fondness of playing with those toys as a kid.
[47:14.970 --> 47:20.210]  And thinking it was so cool that this movie I liked I could have the physical toy from the thing.
[47:20.530 --> 47:21.630]  Did you have a Turbo Man?
[47:22.050 --> 47:23.690]  I hate the way this looks.
[47:24.450 --> 47:28.430]  Like genuinely despise the way this looks.
[47:28.650 --> 47:30.330]  You mean the color scheme?
[47:30.490 --> 47:31.090]  The color combination?
[47:31.090 --> 47:35.230]  Like look at these things.
[47:35.290 --> 47:39.810]  Like I just dropped a picture in the chat like our text channel.
[47:40.090 --> 47:41.550]  I hate this.
[47:42.010 --> 47:44.950]  That one on the left looks like the guy from Galaxy Quest.
[47:48.170 --> 47:59.010]  It's just like this to me is a movie where people said
[47:59.650 --> 48:01.970]  Bro, you saw Toy Story?
[48:02.450 --> 48:05.010]  What if the toys were like fucking twisted?
[48:05.610 --> 48:06.870]  And that's the movie.
[48:07.110 --> 48:08.610]  And it sucks. I don't like it.
[48:09.890 --> 48:11.430]  Yeah, like I can't that's fair.
[48:11.490 --> 48:13.410]  I just have such a fondness from it from my childhood.
[48:13.710 --> 48:15.110]  Yeah, the Gorgonites are just misunderstood.
[48:15.850 --> 48:18.370]  They are. Yeah, and they're supposed to be like He-Man guys.
[48:18.490 --> 48:19.330]  Like, oh God.
[48:19.490 --> 48:20.730]  Oh, okay. Well, I see it.
[48:21.270 --> 48:28.350]  Can we get rid of Six Day Seven Nights from our list?
[48:28.350 --> 48:30.670]  I'm on board with that.
[48:31.590 --> 48:35.630]  Yeah, I'm fine with losing Snake Eyes if we can lose Small Soldiers.
[48:37.210 --> 48:39.110]  Why are you taking me down with you?
[48:39.770 --> 48:43.270]  If we can lose if we lose Small Soldiers, I'm fine with losing Snake Eyes.
[48:44.450 --> 48:46.610]  Well, let's see how many spaces do we have?
[48:46.650 --> 48:48.350]  We have four, five, six, seven.
[48:48.450 --> 48:50.630]  I think at this point Lockstock makes it.
[48:51.390 --> 48:53.730]  It feels like you guys are pretty into it.
[48:53.950 --> 48:55.850]  We have ten with our bubble movies.
[48:57.450 --> 49:02.590]  Okay, I think Halloween H2O should be cut, personally, before Snake Eyes or Small Soldiers.
[49:03.330 --> 49:03.630]  Okay.
[49:04.870 --> 49:05.850]  I'm fine with that.
[49:06.390 --> 49:06.690]  Okay.
[49:08.390 --> 49:09.690]  But here's the thing.
[49:09.970 --> 49:10.530]  Here's the thing.
[49:10.970 --> 49:12.770]  Small Soldiers does not belong on this list.
[49:12.850 --> 49:13.910]  No, it's better than Snake Eyes.
[49:14.690 --> 49:16.150]  It is better than Snake Eyes.
[49:16.790 --> 49:18.630]  Listen, I'm a Nicolas Cage fan.
[49:18.750 --> 49:21.990]  I'm a huge Nicolas Cage fan, and I think Snake Eyes is not a very good movie.
[49:22.110 --> 49:22.870]  Now, here's the thing.
[49:22.870 --> 49:27.930]  I'm not a Nicolas Cage fan at all.
[49:28.290 --> 49:32.390]  And I think Snake Eyes is fucking gonzo, and it should make this cut.
[49:32.930 --> 49:34.770]  Have you ever watched it in one full sitting?
[49:35.270 --> 49:36.870]  Absolutely. Yes, I have.
[49:37.350 --> 49:37.770]  I have.
[49:38.570 --> 49:42.010]  Realistically, we're going back and forth between Snake Eyes and Small Soldiers.
[49:42.410 --> 49:46.590]  I think we're both going to accept the fact that that's probably ten or nine.
[49:46.590 --> 49:47.290]  Oh, yeah.
[49:47.610 --> 49:55.250]  And if that's the case, either one of those are ten or nine, then I feel like Halloween H20 could be ten.
[49:55.590 --> 50:02.590]  Because if you left Small Soldiers and Snake Eyes off this list, ten is such a negligible spot that...
[50:03.150 --> 50:11.230]  I have a real soft spot in my heart for Small Soldiers, but I don't think I necessarily feel as strongly about Small Soldiers as you do about Snake Eyes.
[50:11.230 --> 50:19.010]  So I'm okay with... I'm sorry to hold up on defending the line, Nick, but I am okay if you want to...
[50:19.010 --> 50:21.690]  Small Soldiers is a better film than Snake Eyes.
[50:21.890 --> 50:23.050]  There you go. It's in.
[50:23.730 --> 50:28.990]  Are we too worried that in the US, Lockstock came out in March 1999?
[50:29.950 --> 50:31.810]  Well, yeah, that's what we brought up originally.
[50:32.370 --> 50:32.550]  Oh.
[50:33.750 --> 50:34.210]  I didn't know.
[50:34.210 --> 50:36.650]  Wow, it made $3.7 million.
[50:38.310 --> 50:43.650]  That's why Andrew did wide releases of the summer of 98, and then this got added last minute.
[50:43.670 --> 50:44.730]  Well, let's just take it off.
[50:45.190 --> 50:51.610]  All right, let's just take it off, then. The release date on IMDB, or on Wikipedia, I guess, was the UK release date.
[50:51.730 --> 50:54.710]  Yeah, the 28th of August, 98, it made $18.9 million.
[50:55.450 --> 50:56.230]  Lockstock is out.
[50:56.270 --> 50:57.150]  So let's just take it off.
[50:57.190 --> 50:57.390]  Wow.
[50:57.670 --> 51:00.790]  Which means, I think Can't Hardly Wait makes it in.
[51:01.050 --> 51:01.650]  Yeah, I agree.
[51:01.770 --> 51:02.470]  Oh, shit.
[51:03.170 --> 51:07.370]  And that means 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[51:07.510 --> 51:08.450]  We have nine.
[51:09.270 --> 51:12.410]  Was that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8?
[51:12.610 --> 51:15.930]  Yeah, nine, including Halloween H20.
[51:18.990 --> 51:24.070]  And the two that we're fighting for are Small Soul Jerks and Snakeface.
[51:25.990 --> 51:27.450]  I'm just sitting back for this.
[51:28.570 --> 51:29.050]  Okay.
[51:32.470 --> 51:34.630]  David Cross and Jay Moore in Small Soldiers.
[51:34.770 --> 51:35.330]  Yeah.
[51:35.650 --> 51:39.490]  That does nothing for what... get real.
[51:39.790 --> 51:40.590]  Who cares?
[51:40.890 --> 51:43.110]  It has a video game that was fun.
[51:43.670 --> 51:44.810]  There's chips.
[51:45.410 --> 51:46.930]  What's the guy that did Gremlins?
[51:47.310 --> 51:48.710]  It's one of his works.
[51:48.990 --> 51:50.290]  Did Snake Eyes have toys?
[51:50.470 --> 51:51.030]  I don't think so.
[51:51.470 --> 51:54.530]  No, it had Carla Gugino and Gary Sinise.
[51:54.810 --> 51:56.470]  Oh, we got Frank Langella.
[51:56.850 --> 51:58.650]  We got Frank Langella over here.
[51:58.650 --> 52:03.830]  It had Brian De Palma doing one scene over and over and over again
[52:03.830 --> 52:07.450]  from different perspectives, like his own Rashomon,
[52:07.790 --> 52:14.530]  but none of it came together to really fulfill any kind of obligation or storytelling.
[52:14.930 --> 52:16.130]  It was fantastic.
[52:16.550 --> 52:20.830]  However, Nick Cage wearing this suit?
[52:21.210 --> 52:21.670]  Unreal.
[52:22.130 --> 52:23.750]  What the fuck? Why?
[52:23.910 --> 52:24.710]  That's awesome.
[52:25.110 --> 52:25.790]  That's great.
[52:25.890 --> 52:26.890]  Yeah, it is good.
[52:27.290 --> 52:28.530]  That's a pretty good suit.
[52:28.530 --> 52:31.030]  It is a great Nick Cage performance.
[52:31.130 --> 52:32.030]  Can we get that suit?
[52:37.110 --> 52:41.270]  I hate to do this, Nick, because we're linked in Small Soldiers.
[52:41.690 --> 52:46.690]  What if we got rid of Halloween H20 and then just added Snake Eyes and Small Soldiers?
[52:47.030 --> 52:51.210]  How the fuck is Snake Eyes making it on the list when only one person wants it on the list?
[52:51.590 --> 52:52.590]  That's a good question.
[52:52.830 --> 52:54.090]  That's a great point.
[52:54.410 --> 52:56.830]  Me and Gavin both want Snake Eyes.
[52:56.830 --> 52:59.310]  I never said a single word about Snake Eyes.
[52:59.930 --> 53:03.310]  Gavin's over here. He wants Snake Eyes.
[53:03.410 --> 53:06.950]  You can tell by watching and what he's doing that he wants Snake Eyes.
[53:07.190 --> 53:08.330]  Okay, let's take a vote.
[53:09.690 --> 53:12.210]  Who wants Small Soldiers on the list?
[53:12.510 --> 53:12.830]  I do.
[53:13.390 --> 53:13.890]  I do.
[53:14.710 --> 53:18.650]  Okay, and now who wants Snake Eyes on the list?
[53:18.990 --> 53:20.850]  Me, Gavin...
[53:20.850 --> 53:21.770]  Me, apparently.
[53:22.990 --> 53:23.550]  Gracie...
[53:23.550 --> 53:24.210]  It's tied.
[53:29.190 --> 53:30.950]  Well, it sounds like we're going to be here all night.
[53:32.170 --> 53:33.970]  This is like picking a pope.
[53:36.190 --> 53:40.150]  Hey, Gracie, would you rather see Small Soldiers or Snake Eyes on this list?
[53:46.670 --> 53:50.010]  I feel like I have to go with Snake Eyes because you are my boss.
[53:50.270 --> 53:55.070]  Yes! Okay, so we are Gavin and Gavin, which one would you rather see on this list?
[53:56.570 --> 53:57.330]  Small Soldiers.
[53:57.330 --> 53:58.470]  Son of a bitch!
[54:00.690 --> 54:01.650]  Democracy works!
[54:02.430 --> 54:06.130]  Now, I just won the vote, but I do want to say I don't feel like...
[54:06.130 --> 54:09.190]  I feel like passion should also be measured in this.
[54:09.430 --> 54:12.430]  Like, it shouldn't always just be a majority decision dictating.
[54:13.050 --> 54:13.610]  But, yeah, I agree.
[54:13.990 --> 54:16.770]  I'm putting Snake Eyes in green because it's money.
[54:17.030 --> 54:18.430]  How about this, Eric?
[54:18.850 --> 54:25.770]  How about Snake Eyes is our alternate 11th pick if any of the other 10 can't perform their duties?
[54:25.770 --> 54:28.130]  If Snake Eyes gets to fill in.
[54:28.370 --> 54:32.130]  If we find out that Truman Show came out in January of 1999.
[54:33.170 --> 54:35.450]  I mean, we already got rid of Lockstock, so you never know.
[54:35.570 --> 54:36.010]  They could be scared.
[54:36.330 --> 54:38.830]  First off the bench is Snake Eyes.
[54:39.170 --> 54:41.110]  Okay, so, our 10 right now.
[54:41.350 --> 54:43.910]  In no particular order, this is just what they're listed.
[54:44.470 --> 54:50.970]  Blade, Dirty Work, Truman Show, Basketball, X-Files, Small Soldiers, Boo, Saving Private Ryan,
[54:51.250 --> 54:54.030]  Halloween H20, Armageddon, and Can't Hardly Wait.
[54:54.930 --> 54:56.450]  I think that's a strong list.
[54:56.650 --> 54:58.290]  There's some great movies on that list.
[54:58.390 --> 55:01.250]  Okay, does anyone have any strong feelings about number 1?
[55:01.910 --> 55:02.190]  Yeah.
[55:02.770 --> 55:05.270]  Yeah, maybe it would be easier to go 10.
[55:05.850 --> 55:06.530]  Yeah, let's look.
[55:06.690 --> 55:08.430]  Instead of fighting for 1 immediately.
[55:08.770 --> 55:10.130]  I think Halloween H20 has to be 2.
[55:10.130 --> 55:10.690]  Yeah, you got it.
[55:10.730 --> 55:12.630]  Small Soldiers in at number 10.
[55:13.590 --> 55:14.130]  Well, yeah.
[55:14.350 --> 55:15.570]  In at number 10 or 9.
[55:16.170 --> 55:19.790]  I think X-Files, but if you guys want to make Small Soldiers.
[55:19.790 --> 55:22.610]  I just think the cultural relevance of X-Files makes it higher.
[55:22.750 --> 55:24.010]  I feel like X-Files is way higher.
[55:24.010 --> 55:25.910]  Yeah, it's a better movie, I think.
[55:26.090 --> 55:28.810]  If you're talking cultural relevance, then you got to stop shitting on Halloween.
[55:29.010 --> 55:31.110]  Because it had just as much cultural relevance in that time.
[55:31.550 --> 55:32.750]  You think it was just as big?
[55:33.530 --> 55:34.970]  That movie, though, or just the franchise?
[55:35.750 --> 55:36.030]  Both.
[55:36.870 --> 55:37.030]  Okay.
[55:41.230 --> 55:42.270]  Small Soldiers at 10.
[55:42.810 --> 55:43.090]  That's fine.
[55:44.470 --> 55:45.310]  Yeah, I'm not going to fight.
[55:45.350 --> 55:46.110]  It's on the list.
[55:46.370 --> 55:47.090]  Like, wherever you want to put it.
[55:50.790 --> 55:51.930]  We fought hard for 10.
[55:53.130 --> 55:53.570]  Great.
[55:55.670 --> 55:56.110]  Okay.
[55:56.430 --> 55:57.150]  Number 9.
[55:57.270 --> 55:58.910]  Anyone feel anything particular there for 9?
[55:59.530 --> 55:59.930]  X-Files.
[56:00.630 --> 56:02.550]  I think X-Files should be top 5.
[56:03.530 --> 56:03.970]  Whoa!
[56:04.190 --> 56:04.970]  Top 5?
[56:05.090 --> 56:05.370]  Wow!
[56:05.370 --> 56:07.170]  I think that like 5.
[56:07.530 --> 56:09.510]  Then, how about for number 9?
[56:09.590 --> 56:10.550]  How about Can't Hardly Wait?
[56:10.650 --> 56:11.150]  That movie sucks.
[56:11.370 --> 56:12.030]  I do...
[56:12.030 --> 56:12.330]  Okay.
[56:12.450 --> 56:13.950]  I don't think it sucks.
[56:14.290 --> 56:19.470]  But I do think that it is a solid 8, 9, or 10 pick to have Can't Hardly Wait there.
[56:19.730 --> 56:20.750]  I'm not against that.
[56:21.210 --> 56:21.910]  I'm fine with Can't Hardly Wait.
[56:21.910 --> 56:22.730]  Can't Hardly Wait at 9.
[56:23.210 --> 56:23.610]  Yeah.
[56:24.550 --> 56:25.250]  Here's my problem.
[56:25.470 --> 56:29.450]  I think there's one clear winner, and then I really don't give a fuck between 2 through 10.
[56:29.750 --> 56:32.010]  What do you think the clear winner is?
[56:32.690 --> 56:37.530]  I think it's pretty obvious the best movie from the summer of 1998 that's the clear champion is Dirty Work.
[56:37.930 --> 56:38.230]  No.
[56:39.910 --> 56:40.310]  Absolutely.
[56:40.890 --> 56:41.870]  It's in the top 3.
[56:43.190 --> 56:45.330]  If it's in the top 3, it's number 1.
[56:45.930 --> 56:49.090]  I think if it's in the top... I don't know about that.
[56:49.090 --> 56:56.070]  I'm going to make an argument, and this is maybe both a positive and, in my opinion, a negative for this movie.
[56:56.150 --> 56:57.090]  I think it kind of weighs it down.
[56:57.530 --> 57:03.230]  I think Saving Private Ryan is an incredible movie, but it's not a 98 movie to me.
[57:03.630 --> 57:08.110]  I feel like you could release Saving Private Ryan now and it would be one of the best movies of this year.
[57:08.690 --> 57:12.430]  It's not, to me, a real reference of that time period.
[57:12.550 --> 57:14.750]  I think you could say the same thing about Dirty Work.
[57:14.750 --> 57:22.590]  Yeah, I don't know why you think a movie being so good you could release it now would be detrimental to its selection on this list.
[57:22.590 --> 57:25.370]  I can sort of see his point, because this is the summer of 98.
[57:25.610 --> 57:26.570]  This is the summer of 98.
[57:26.930 --> 57:34.750]  Yeah, and Saving Private Ryan is a tantamount thing. It's huge in the summer of 98.
[57:35.290 --> 57:42.730]  Sure, it released then, but I'm saying when I think of 90s things, I think of The X-Files. I don't think of Saving Private Ryan as being important.
[57:42.730 --> 57:45.350]  Then Can't Hardly Wait should be like number two.
[57:45.530 --> 57:46.110]  Yeah, I agree.
[57:46.690 --> 57:48.170]  It's like the movie Go.
[57:48.790 --> 57:54.190]  No, but I'm saying I personally would have it higher. I'm agreeing with you. I would have Can't Hardly Wait probably like six.
[57:54.590 --> 57:58.530]  No offense to you, but that's just your opinion, man.
[57:58.990 --> 57:59.390]  Definitely.
[57:59.810 --> 58:03.130]  A lot of people associate the summer of 98 with Saving Private Ryan.
[58:03.590 --> 58:07.610]  Sure, I think Saving Private Ryan, for me, Saving Private Ryan is number one on this list.
[58:07.610 --> 58:13.450]  I understand Dirty Work is not going to get number one. It's my number one, but I assumed Saving Private Ryan would be number one.
[58:13.550 --> 58:14.490]  That's what I thought.
[58:14.770 --> 58:18.830]  Really? I think there's a different movie that is number one, personally.
[58:19.310 --> 58:22.990]  You think Blade is number one, Andrew?
[58:22.990 --> 58:25.930]  No, I don't. I think Blade's top five.
[58:26.330 --> 58:27.370]  That's what I thought he was thinking.
[58:27.510 --> 58:28.650]  I think Blade is a top five film.
[58:28.870 --> 58:31.790]  It sounds like we've got about nine movies that we all want to put in the top five.
[58:33.350 --> 58:38.190]  And yeah, it's my opinion. That's all I have. I'm not saying I'm right. I'm just stating that was my perspective.
[58:42.260 --> 58:44.340]  Do we have one that we think should be eight?
[58:47.940 --> 58:48.740]  What's number...
[58:50.540 --> 58:51.800]  Number ten is...
[58:51.800 --> 58:53.160]  How about Halloween?
[58:54.360 --> 58:55.520]  Put Halloween number eight.
[58:55.700 --> 58:57.240]  Yeah, I'm fine with that.
[58:57.820 --> 59:01.600]  Put all the stuff that barely made this list into these names.
[59:01.600 --> 59:02.860]  Get the faff out of the way.
[59:03.180 --> 59:03.960]  Armageddon is seven.
[59:03.960 --> 59:05.160]  Are you serious?
[59:05.420 --> 59:07.220]  Armageddon is like number two.
[59:07.520 --> 59:10.380]  Armageddon is probably three under Truman Show.
[59:11.620 --> 59:13.780]  I'm fine with Armageddon at seven.
[59:14.680 --> 59:16.180]  I'm not an Armageddon fan.
[59:16.600 --> 59:19.160]  I'm not a huge Armageddon fan, but that movie...
[59:19.780 --> 59:21.940]  Summer of 98 written all over it.
[59:22.000 --> 59:24.820]  It's a massive explosive fire font.
[59:25.400 --> 59:25.740]  That's true.
[59:26.020 --> 59:27.280]  I didn't see it until ten years later.
[59:27.940 --> 59:30.200]  Yeah, I saw it much later as well.
[59:31.760 --> 59:33.780]  I think that's a very valid point.
[59:33.880 --> 59:36.800]  I think I would personally rank it at seven.
[59:37.180 --> 59:42.380]  You always train drillers to be astronauts and not astronauts to be drillers.
[59:42.620 --> 59:44.040]  Here's my question.
[59:44.440 --> 59:45.080]  I have a question.
[59:45.240 --> 59:53.380]  Are we picking the best movie of 1998 or the movie that was the best movie, I guess, emblematic of 98?
[59:53.740 --> 59:56.720]  Because I feel like we have two scales here.
[59:56.720 --> 59:58.880]  Yeah, I think that's what makes it tough.
[59:58.940 --> 01:00:01.520]  I think both scales, to me at least, have relevance.
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:05.680]  Yeah, because I think Armageddon is not a very good film and I wouldn't want to watch it again.
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:12.940]  But it's hard to argue that it wasn't one of the biggest things in at least America in the summer of 98.
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:14.640]  Oh, internationally huge as well.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:15.740]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:18.220]  It's like number one, number two material.
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:19.980]  When was Deep Impact out?
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.000]  Wasn't that around the same time?
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:21.980]  A little bit before.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.260]  Came out right before it.
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:24.500]  Same year.
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:25.280]  Okay.
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:31.000]  If I'm doing 1, 2, 3, if I'm picking 1, 2, 3, Saving Private Ryan, Armageddon, Truman Show.
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:32.460]  That's my 1, 2, 3.
[01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:34.040]  I'm letting you know right now.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.460]  That's how I feel about what we have on this list.
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.580]  Mine would be Dirty Work, Basketball, Truman Show.
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:40.960]  Wow.
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:46.280]  If Geoff's thinking Basketball could be in top three, I'm absolutely fighting for Basketball to be in top three.
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:49.280]  It's without any irony my favorite film.
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:49.940]  Yeah.
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:55.580]  Mine would be Truman Show, Dirty Work, Blade.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:56.920]  My top three.
[01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:59.400]  Oh, Blade's so good. Blade's up there too.
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:02.020]  Mine would be Saving Private Ryan, Truman Show, Blade.
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:03.540]  Wow.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.920]  I will say that I think we all pick Truman Show to be a top three.
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:10.640]  I think Truman Show is one, personally.
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.280]  Here's the thing, here's the thing.
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:17.720]  If we all say it's top three and it's the only one we agree on, it might be number one.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:20.860]  All right, let's slot it in at number one right now just to get it out of the way.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:21.660]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:29.260]  It really, Gavin, it's a great pick and it really is, to me, it's a number one.
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:33.760]  I feel like it's one of those films where I just want to know more about the universe.
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:35.640]  Like I want to know more about the behind the scenes.
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:41.540]  It's probably why I like Westworld and stuff where it's just like they don't over explain anything that's happening.
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:42.920]  It's just like you get little glimpses.
[01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:46.000]  You're like, oh, I guess people are coming in through the elevators.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.760]  And I think what you were saying, Geoff, I think it is the perfect balance of both those scales.
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:56.380]  Like to me, it is a very 90s idea and how it's portrayed.
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.860]  And it's also just a fucking great movie.
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:00.620]  Like it hits both things for me.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.120]  That's why I would have it at one.
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:03.080]  Okay.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:09.260]  I think X-Files is number five, number six on this list.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.100]  I'm fine with that.
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:12.400]  It could be anywhere in five, six or seven.
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.860]  Put it at six right now.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:14.880]  Okay.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.280]  I think that's fair.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:19.620]  You have a real genuine and deserved hatred of it.
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.300]  You just put Halloween.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:22.500]  Ignore what he said.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:24.540]  I was a little bit older than y'all.
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:25.200]  So that's funny.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:27.980]  I was 23 in the summer of 98.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.800]  So I still remember all this pretty well.
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:35.960]  I would put Basketball at a number four or number five personally.
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:37.940]  Oh, I would love to see it at four.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.560]  Let's put it at four right now.
[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:40.320]  Yeah, let's do it. Four.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:45.940]  That was the first film I watched that had, you know, the one joke every five seconds sort of thing.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.180]  That was also just a filthy movie.
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:50.220]  And I just loved both aspects of that.
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:55.500]  I think Dirty Work is a number five.
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:00.180]  Because I really do think two and three are Armageddon and Saving Private Ryan.
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:04.260]  I think Saving Private Ryan...
[01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:05.860]  I'd put it at...
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.660]  I'd put it at five.
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:12.120]  Did you appreciate Saving Private Ryan in the 90s though, Eric?
[01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:12.760]  Yeah.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:13.860]  Were you old enough?
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:14.300]  Yeah.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:19.820]  Watching that movie, the scene where he's like... it's like the knife fight with the Nazi.
[01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:21.920]  And he's like pushing it into him.
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.960]  It's like in my fucking brain until the day I die.
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.080]  It's in my brain.
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:33.440]  That movie was like... it changed shit.
[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:36.420]  And is so big.
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:40.160]  And so... it was just such... it was such a film.
[01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:41.240]  It was huge.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:42.120]  Huge.
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:42.860]  Alright.
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:48.860]  My problem with that film is that it came out the year I got out of the military.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:53.980]  And it was probably the most realistic depiction of battle I've ever seen.
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:57.580]  And I cried buckets through the entire film.
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:59.540]  And I have never sat through the movie since.
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.360]  Anytime I tried... I tried to watch it at Bernie's house a couple years ago.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.480]  And I just started bursting into tears and I couldn't handle it.
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:04.820]  I had to leave.
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:07.140]  Which is like... that movie affects me in a way.
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:10.100]  I just... I'll say I don't like it because of how upsetting it is to me.
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:10.840]  Completely understand.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:16.600]  The shot... the shots of the ramps coming down off the boats is one of the most disturbing scenes in any film.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:17.300]  A hundred percent.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.980]  And you just think like, holy shit.
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:20.840]  It's just so crazy.
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:21.720]  Everything's a dice roll.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.280]  And Vin Diesel's in it.
[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:25.520]  Not for long though.
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:27.300]  Not for long.
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:28.920]  I... so I submitted...
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:29.360]  He's in it.
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.520]  I ranked every one of these.
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.420]  And then I sent my list to TPG.
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:35.540]  And TPG... I'd love to include it at the end of this.
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:39.260]  He did like a reaction to every one of my picks.
[01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:43.200]  And he gave this fun... this great fun fact about Saving Private Ryan.
[01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:46.140]  I guess when they were doing like the combat training for it.
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:50.340]  Vin Diesel was notoriously shit at throwing fake grenades.
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.220]  He was awful at it.
[01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:54.400]  And I don't know if they like had to change things because of it.
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.420]  But just everyone made fun of how bad he was at throwing the grenades.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:58.560]  Terrible.
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:04:59.760]  That tracks.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:00.560]  It does.
[01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:02.680]  So you wouldn't put Saving Private Ryan at number two?
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:05.560]  I think you guys have made some really great points for it.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:08.040]  Like I'm not... if it's there, I'm totally fine with that.
[01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:10.260]  I think I'd personally have it a bit lower.
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:11.520]  But I think it's well deserved.
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:12.280]  It's like an amazing...
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:15.640]  I mean, if Schindler's List was in this list, would it be at number one?
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:16.280]  Yes.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:16.740]  Yeah.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:17.220]  Yeah.
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:19.000]  Alright, put it at number two.
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:20.400]  Okay.
[01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:21.860]  Number three.
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:24.780]  How is it not Armageddon?
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:27.020]  Because dirty work exists.
[01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:29.980]  And basketball exists.
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:31.760]  That's nearly a reason.
[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:33.520]  Blade exists.
[01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:38.420]  I feel like, obviously, Armageddon, huge 98 movie, everywhere, all over the advertising.
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:42.780]  But there's no way that holds up as anything worth watching now.
[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:45.500]  I watched it in probably June.
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:47.020]  Still liked it?
[01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:48.840]  Fun as hell.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:53.980]  When they go to the strip club and they start telling the strippers that they're astronauts.
[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:57.160]  It's so fucking funny.
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.740]  There are so many good moments.
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:00.000]  It's a lot of fun.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.860]  Even when Steve Buscemi just starts going apeshit.
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:05.180]  Yeah, it's... look, when...
[01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:06.880]  It looks so 90s.
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:08.240]  The budget is way too high.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.060]  But that's just what 90s movies were.
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:10.860]  They were just exorbitant.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:12.120]  Like, they were ugly.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.760]  But, like, man, it's really good.
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:18.160]  It's still, like, a really fun movie.
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.300]  Oh, it's also got the Aerosmith song, though.
[01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:23.160]  Oh, that is just so... so 98.
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:29.740]  I think I'd be okay with Armageddon at three if Dirty Work was four.
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:32.160]  Oh, you're bumping basketball, huh?
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.560]  I can see that, too.
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:34.700]  Yeah, I could live with that.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.460]  I think we do have to live with that.
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:37.120]  Okay.
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:38.020]  Yeah?
[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:39.100]  Here's what's gonna happen.
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:42.500]  And this is why this... when it's all said and done, we're gonna have a good list.
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:46.080]  I don't think any of us is gonna be happy with the list at the end of it.
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:47.260]  And that's how you know...
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:50.020]  Like, that's how you know you truly compromised.
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:53.100]  If nobody got their way, then we got a good list.
[01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:53.620]  Yep.
[01:06:54.060 --> 01:07:01.160]  Yeah, I mean, I'm looking at this list, and I would skip a few and just go straight to basketball if I had to watch any of these movies now.
[01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:02.960]  Like, some of these movies are heavy movies.
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:04.840]  That puts Blade at seven.
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.640]  I don't like Blade at seven.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:07.700]  I don't like Blade at seven.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:09.260]  Switch Blade and X-Files.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:09.600]  Yeah.
[01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:10.420]  I can live with that.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.140]  Yeah, I would switch Blade and X-Files.
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:12.920]  That's... yep.
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:14.100]  I can live with that.
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:17.080]  Now, I don't want to continue to push it.
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.900]  Is Blade above basketball?
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:23.440]  I don't know. It might be.
[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:26.280]  It's so 90s, and it's so good.
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.960]  Motherfuckers can't skate uphill.
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:29.980]  It's so great.
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:31.180]  It's so good.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.100]  The little fucking...
[01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:39.360]  The hand gesture he does, like that weird fist bump thing in the leather suit.
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.300]  It's so good.
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:41.580]  It's so dumb.
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:44.380]  He is so fucking cool.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:49.200]  But what about when Coop and Rema make out under the Malakalaka board?
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:08:03.020]  What about when fucking Lem from The Shield thinks he's going to a party and is having a great time, and then fucking blood pours from the ceiling from all the sprinkler heads.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:03.860]  It is true.
[01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:08.540]  And they go crazy, and he's terrified. It is such a memorable intro.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.260]  Oh, it's so good.
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:12.920]  That dude was awesome.
[01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:15.860]  He's great. He's great in everything he's in.
[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:17.380]  He was great in that show, too, man.
[01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:19.380]  So good in The Shield.
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.820]  Let's go alphabetical. Baseketball, blade. Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:28.060]  I think basketball is above blade.
[01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.440]  I do, too. And I have a blade tattoo.
[01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:33.440]  That says a lot.
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:35.600]  You know what? I'm going to get a Lazy Boy tattoo.
[01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:43.340]  Do Matt Stone and Trey Parker like basketball?
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:46.280]  I don't think so. I think they were making it the same time as us.
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.200]  I don't think they liked each other.
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:55.780]  They were making it just for shits and giggles between South Park episodes, right? They were like barely awake the whole movie.
[01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:58.860]  Because it's not like they didn't write it or anything, right?
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:06.200]  Everything I've read is that they hated all the movies that they made, and they hated the process of making films.
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:09.080]  And it almost destroyed their relationship.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:14.960]  Directed by David Zucker, writers David Zucker, Robert Locash, and Louis Friedman.
[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:15.920]  It's not written by them.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:17.640]  I assume they wrote and directed.
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:20.520]  No, it was the Zuckers.
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.980]  They did Orgasmo and Cannibal the Musical.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:36.040]  It says on IMDb that they agreed to do the movie with the assumption that by the time filming began, South Park would be cancelled.
[01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:44.380]  Wow, budget $25 million, box office $7 million.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:46.960]  There you go.
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:50.760]  Well, maybe we'll block out box office. What did Blade make? Did it make more than $7 million?
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:58.340]  Okay, so here's our top 10 list as picked by us.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:01.500]  Number 10, Small Soldiers.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:04.040]  Number 9, Can't Hardly Wait.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.760]  Number 8, Halloween H2O.
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:08.400]  Number 7, The X-Files.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.360]  Number 6, Blade.
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:10.820]  Number 5, Basketball.
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:12.660]  Number 4, Dirty Work.
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.880]  Number 3, Armageddon.
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.000]  Number 2, Saving Private Ryan.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:20.480]  And our number 1 pick for the summer of 98, Truman Show.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:23.400]  I think that's a good list.
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.000]  Yeah, I'm not happy with it.
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:30.100]  So I think that means it's a good list.
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:30.940]  Yeah.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.740]  What would you change?
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:35.600]  What would I change?
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.240]  You're asking what would I change?
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.520]  Yeah, what would you both flip?
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:39.660]  What would make you happier?
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:41.900]  Saving Private Ryan would be number 1.
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:43.220]  Armageddon would be number 2.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:44.540]  Truman Show would be number 3.
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:48.380]  Blade...
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:50.740]  The rest of it's probably fine.
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.200]  Small Soldiers would not be on the list.
[01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:53.080]  Snake Eyes would be on the list.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.160]  Well, Snake Eyes is first off the menu.
[01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:57.740]  It's true.
[01:10:58.340 --> 01:10:59.780]  Number 11, Snake Eyes.
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:04.160]  If Can't Hardly Wait can't fulfill their obligations, then Snake Eyes is in.
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.500]  That's true, that's true.
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:09.700]  Gavin, any thoughts?
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:13.680]  Yeah, I think it's... I can't argue any further with this list.
[01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:14.340]  Yeah.
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:22.720]  I would probably... I think 1 and 2 could easily swap for anyone, but I'm very happy with Truman Show number 1.
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:26.640]  I think it's fair. I think it's a fair choice to have Truman Show at number 1.
[01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:33.880]  It's not what I would put there, but I think by virtue of us all putting it top 3, it deserves it.
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:35.300]  It deserves to be there and making this list.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:39.980]  If you don't know what's coming, when he crashes the boat into the wall, it's such a shocking moment.
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:42.100]  It's such an amazing moment.
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:48.380]  It also is interesting to watch now. Like, I watched it for the first time maybe like 2 or 3 years ago.
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:52.760]  And just the living in a world where, like, vlogging wasn't a thing.
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:55.980]  Like, the way that they talk about it is so interesting now.
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:58.280]  To, like, watch it within a modern context.
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:05.520]  Of, like, the amount of work they do to essentially create a vlog is fascinating.
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:09.140]  That is pretty much what it is, huh?
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:14.800]  Yeah. It's like this entire... like, they could not predict that people would willingly just do this.
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:18.060]  That's such a good point. Do it voluntarily.
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:22.540]  Yeah, like, it's so much effort and money for a thing that people would do.
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:27.860]  But then it creates a question of, like, how influential was the Truman Show in vlogging as an idea?
[01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:30.560]  Like, did that have an impact in the culture going forward?
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:31.820]  I think it must have.
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:32.880]  I think it would too.
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:33.360]  I would think so, yeah.
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:37.580]  Yeah, there's people in the bath watching people live.
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:39.880]  I live there.
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.540]  That's my summer home.
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:43.500]  Yeah, their name is Andrew.
[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:49.180]  Alright, well, this has been a lot longer. This took longer than I thought it was.
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:52.700]  But none of it, I think, is bad. I think all of it is very, like...
[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:53.420]  This is strong.
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:56.260]  Yeah, I was worried that this would go by too quickly.
[01:12:56.260 --> 01:13:00.780]  But this was a great recording. And thank you guys so much for being willing to do this.
[01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:01.220]  Thanks for putting this together, Andrew.
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:03.740]  Yeah, this is a really great idea, Andrew.
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:04.420]  Awesome.
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:04.960]  What a year. What a summer.
[01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:06.920]  What a great summer this was.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.880]  The last good year, 1998.
[01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:11.160]  Don't tell that to 2013.
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:15.460]  Yeah, I do think there is an argument for 2013 as being a really good year.
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:21.260]  That's okay. So, for context of people who are listening to this, and I don't think we talked about it in this episode, but right before...
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:35.000]  Jess and Erica on our sales team have been having a debate, sort of, outside of our summer of 98 stuff, where they think that 2013 is the year that they're very, like...
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.080]  Like, oh, that's what I missed, and all, like, these things around 2013.
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:45.880]  Because here's why. I'm floating down the river, I've got a beer in my hand, and Get Lucky by Daft Punk is playing out of someone's speaker.
[01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:47.040]  Not a bad year.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:50.240]  And it's just like, well, you know, this is good. Everything's fine.
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.100]  Take me back.
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:55.240]  Blurred Lines was everywhere. It was inescapable.
[01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:56.440]  Never mind.
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:13:59.240]  Absolutely inescapable.
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:00.640]  Just keep your mouth a little bit.
[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:06.360]  2013 had a couple of songs, or had, like, some, like, music and everything.
[01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:15.540]  But if you go to, like, the movies of 2013, and then you look at just summer of 98, insane, the difference.
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:18.300]  Because 2013 doesn't hold a candle to this.
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:20.120]  Blurred Lines went diamond.
[01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:22.000]  Yeah, dude. Massive.
[01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:23.460]  What is diamond?
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:24.800]  Ten platinums.
[01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:25.220]  Yep.
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:33.760]  Wow. It was huge. I mean, I don't think people understand how big it was. Massive. And then sued for the rights.
[01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:37.420]  Anyway, Andrew, you should take us out from this. Do a nice little outro.
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:45.080]  I will take us out. Before I do the outro, you know how they have those DVDs where it's like four films in one, like those budget DVDs?
[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:48.700]  Imagining our top four as a four-pack is a wild ride.
[01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:49.600]  That's a good one, though.
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:56.160]  Truman Show, Saving Private Ryan, Armageddon, and Dirty Work. There's a lot of range in that four-pack.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.020]  You're getting a real experience.
[01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:03.280]  Well, this has been the Summer of 98 movie list. Thank you so much, you guys, for going through this process with me.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:08.180]  We're all unhappy, but I think that makes us happy as a collective, which is great.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:12.140]  If you watch this, please let us know what your top ten would be.
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:14.840]  Would you have snake eyes? I bet you won't.
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:15.360]  What?
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:21.640]  Enjoy the next piece coming up, which will be the music of 98, which I have no idea how that will go.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:23.480]  Poorly.
[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:25.240]  Bye. That was terrible.
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:29.520]  That was... I really liked my intro to it better than Gavin's.
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:33.180]  Outro, I would say as bad if not worse.
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.760]  At least the closing part. I didn't know how to end it.
[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:37.300]  As bad as mine?
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:39.140]  I think so. It was pretty bad.
[01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:41.180]  I didn't think it was...
[01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:43.260]  I think it was great up until the end.
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:45.240]  I really botched the last 5%.
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:48.240]  Yeah, you teased the last piece of content. You shouldn't have done that.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.220]  I think you got in your head a little bit.
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:52.300]  I did. I was nervous. Bye!
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:06.780]  It's your boy TPG.
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:08.720]  It's Wednesday, July 19th.
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:11.000]  Someone's lawn mowing outside.
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.100]  I got a craving for a quesadilla.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:18.640]  And the legend Andrew Pantin just sent me the list of the 1998 movies, which we'll be looking at right now.
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:21.540]  Let's go ahead. We're opening it up. And we're off.
[01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:24.800]  Alright, number 1 in the ranking... I see.
[01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:27.880]  Is the Truman Show. Classic. Goated.
[01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:32.360]  What else needs to be said? The fact that this movie impacted a generation.
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:35.120]  Peter Weir, owner-rated director, obviously.
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:45.060]  Jim Carrey. You know, Jim Carrey actually has a very strange autobiography, sci-fi head trip of a book that I would recommend.
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:46.840]  Definitely check that out.
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:52.240]  Dirty Work, number 2. Massive f***face energy. Saw this in the theaters. Great call.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:56.880]  Blade, number 3. Best superhero opening ever made.
[01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:59.420]  Introduced me and my whole family to techno.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:07.280]  Iconic. One-liners. Sick fighting. Probably David Goyer's best writing. Just a dope movie.
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:10.280]  Private Ryan. Dope movie.
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.440]  Fun fact, I saw this screen at the Arrow in Los Angeles on film.
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:20.160]  And they were talking about the legendary boot camp that people went to.
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:29.540]  And Adam Goldberg was there. And he told this story how our boy Vin Toretto himself could not throw a grenade.
[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:33.580]  Like, he didn't have the throwing ability in his body and it was very stressful.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.440]  So, sorry to put that out there, Dom.
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:40.320]  Wrong flick hues. I don't know what that is. I should watch it.
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:45.020]  Massive cred gap. Out of sight. Soderbergh. Great flick.
[01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:49.060]  I saw this at a sleepover. I didn't really understand what was going on.
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:52.920]  Can't hardly wait. Love Hewitt. Great flick.
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:55.380]  Haven't seen it since also at a sleepover.
[01:17:55.780 --> 01:18:00.140]  Small Soldiers in the 8th spot. Just watched this movie with my entire family.
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:05.240]  Weak. Not weak, but just like average opening and just an insane finale.
[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:13.560]  I don't think I'll ever get the image of the little corn the comp sticks getting shot into some kid's leg by a psycho commando.
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:19.100]  And obviously this movie is just so nuts. The end. Incredible.
[01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:22.280]  Armageddon. What else needs to be said?
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:29.960]  Outside of the fact that you guys gotta track down the audio of Michael Bay talking about the spacesuits.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:35.340]  A lot of people talk about the Ben Affleck making fun of the movie and the astronauts.
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:38.020]  That's cool and I have my own thoughts on Affleck.
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:41.800]  But the Bay talking about spacesuits is iconic.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:47.900]  Basketball. First glimpse, I think, of Trey and Matt's brilliance.
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:52.020]  And then we're moving into a couple other ones.
[01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:55.980]  X-Files movie. My parents took me to see this. It was awesome.
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:59.940]  Really kind of blew my mind. Shout out to like the black goo or the black tar.
[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:03.860]  Which also would come back again in Prometheus, so I think they're canon.
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:07.360]  Mulan. Never saw this one.
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:10.000]  Why do fools fall in love? Never saw that one.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.700]  Ever After. I think I didn't go on a date to see that.
[01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:16.000]  Madeline. I'll read the books.
[01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:19.540]  Parent Trap. Saw this one recently. Pretty fun.
[01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:30.880]  Really creates like a weird wish fulfillment, I would say, of young girls hoping that they have another set of parents and a long lost sister who is extremely rich.
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:35.040]  Ooh, The Negotiator. Samuel L. Heeter movie, dude.
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:36.260]  Liked this one a lot.
[01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:41.280]  I think this was F. Gary Gray, who has put together a really interesting career for himself, for sure.
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:46.860]  Snake Eyes. De Palma. I didn't understand the artistic clout that was in this movie.
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:58.180]  But I did enjoy like it as kind of a weird spiritual sequel that teaches all the fans of the Nick Cave Trinity, The Rock, Bad Boys, and Con Air about art.
[01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:03.560]  Perfect Murderer. Don't remember this one. Air Bud 2. Not a big dog guy.
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:06.600]  Something About Mary. Low key overrated.
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:10.900]  Halloween H20. Never saw it. Wasn't into scary movies then.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:16.020]  Lethal Weapon 4. Introduced the entire country to Jet Li.
[01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:19.280]  Dope movie. Dr. Dolittle. No thanks.
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:23.700]  54. I think this is a gourmet movie about a disco. Not for me.
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.980]  Six Days, Seven Nights. Shout out to Anne Heche.
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:29.420]  Shout out to Harrison Ford, of course.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.420]  Dance With Me. Don't know what that is. Disturbing Behavior. This has been on my list for a minute.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.180]  Mafia. Love Jay Moore. Loved him in Air.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:42.320]  Dead Man on Campus. Heard of it. Never saw it.
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:45.180]  How Stella Got Her Groove Back. Never seen it.
[01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:48.520]  Avengers. Saw this in the theaters. Very confusing.
[01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:53.100]  And I would say like we're missing the faculty, which is crazy.
