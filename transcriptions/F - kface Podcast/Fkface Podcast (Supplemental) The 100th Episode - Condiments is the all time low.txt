[00:04.900 --> 00:06.400]  Previously on F**kface.
[00:16.420 --> 00:25.540]  Hello and welcome to episode 100 of the F**kface podcast. Can you believe we've done this 99 times up until this moment?
[00:25.780 --> 00:30.540]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, with me always, with me as always, Gavin Free and Andrew Panton.
[00:31.040 --> 00:33.800]  Guys, I have a little game I want to play with you for episode 100.
[00:34.460 --> 00:37.340]  This is for Nick, this is for Nick, this is for Eric,
[00:37.340 --> 00:38.960]  this is for Gavin and Andrew.
[00:39.340 --> 00:44.340]  I would like you all to pick a number between 1 and 3 and then post that number in the Discord chat.
[00:44.720 --> 00:45.880]  Between 1 and 3?
[00:46.040 --> 00:48.240]  Between 1 and 3. 1, 2, or 3.
[00:48.860 --> 00:49.340]  Okay.
[00:50.560 --> 00:56.880]  Now, just to clarify, is this the illusion of choice that was discussed before, or is this unrelated to the illusion of choice?
[00:56.880 --> 00:58.560]  I'm interested to see.
[00:58.920 --> 00:59.240]  Okay.
[00:59.920 --> 01:00.980]  Alright, the results are in.
[01:02.500 --> 01:03.620]  Uh, what?
[01:04.380 --> 01:06.580]  Can you really? The chat's right there.
[01:06.640 --> 01:07.440]  What are you talking about?
[01:07.920 --> 01:09.500]  Do you want us to just read the majority?
[01:09.820 --> 01:11.040]  Geoff never has it open.
[01:11.160 --> 01:12.500]  Okay, I got it now. It wasn't uploaded.
[01:12.720 --> 01:15.240]  Alright, it looks like number 2 wins.
[01:15.600 --> 01:16.040]  Okay.
[01:17.860 --> 01:19.780]  So, let me post this.
[01:20.420 --> 01:21.140]  Did that post?
[01:21.660 --> 01:23.440]  It's typing. You're definitely typing.
[01:23.700 --> 01:25.120]  Which is great for an audio show.
[01:25.840 --> 01:26.780]  How does this work?
[01:28.120 --> 01:29.560]  How does what work? What do you mean?
[01:29.560 --> 01:31.920]  We just said we've done 99 of these.
[01:32.260 --> 01:34.020]  How does what work?
[01:34.260 --> 01:35.680]  I can't get this image to paste.
[01:35.940 --> 01:37.040]  What are you talking about?
[01:37.100 --> 01:39.480]  There we go. You guys picked number 2.
[01:39.840 --> 01:42.000]  Okay, Derek, go ahead and start with number 2.
[01:42.840 --> 01:43.280]  Fantastic.
[01:43.980 --> 01:44.460]  God damn it.
[01:44.460 --> 01:45.560]  I think that's the best one.
[01:46.220 --> 01:46.660]  Yeah.
[01:47.220 --> 01:49.320]  Wait, so start. So you are...
[01:49.320 --> 01:51.600]  So could you describe the scene? You're getting a tattoo.
[01:52.320 --> 01:55.180]  Yeah, so there's a tattoo chair next to me.
[01:55.180 --> 01:55.500]  Ow.
[01:55.780 --> 01:57.460]  There's a tattoo chair next to me at my desk.
[01:57.460 --> 01:59.900]  Wait, you're getting that tattooed on you right now?
[02:00.120 --> 02:04.600]  I already had. I had one of the most talented tattoo artists in Austin, Derek.
[02:05.260 --> 02:06.640]  That's the biggest one.
[02:07.080 --> 02:08.200]  Tattooed me a few times.
[02:08.900 --> 02:12.540]  I had him... we created three custom f*** face tattoos.
[02:12.740 --> 02:13.540]  I think we're gonna make a...
[02:13.540 --> 02:14.200]  That hurts.
[02:14.680 --> 02:16.640]  I think we're gonna make a...
[02:16.640 --> 02:18.060]  I think... fuck, this is hard to talk.
[02:18.360 --> 02:20.360]  I think we're gonna make a...
[02:20.360 --> 02:21.860]  We're gonna make some temporary tattoos.
[02:22.460 --> 02:25.260]  But I went ahead and... Derek and I, we placed all three of these on my body.
[02:25.260 --> 02:29.140]  And then we figured... I'm gonna let you guys pick which one I get.
[02:29.780 --> 02:31.480]  Dude, right at the beginning.
[02:33.920 --> 02:36.160]  I think I'll probably get all three.
[02:36.460 --> 02:40.180]  Wait, you're doing this, but you keep saying it's hard to talk.
[02:40.340 --> 02:44.420]  You did this thing for an audio podcast where it's hard for you to talk.
[02:44.640 --> 02:46.260]  Like minute one as well.
[02:46.440 --> 02:49.960]  Well, you know, I was f*** facing myself and the podcast and the audience and you.
[02:50.260 --> 02:52.120]  Well, and you don't want to keep Derek hanging around.
[02:52.120 --> 02:56.540]  Right, well, you know, Derek's a busy man. He's got shit to do.
[02:56.960 --> 02:59.480]  Outside of tattooing me on my ribs.
[03:01.300 --> 03:07.800]  Yeah, I'm getting the Don Zimmer, Pedro Martinez fight outlined on my ribs right now.
[03:07.860 --> 03:11.500]  Which is one of the more painful places to get tattooed, I might say.
[03:11.700 --> 03:15.000]  So you're sat in your nice desk, you know, nice shelves all around.
[03:15.260 --> 03:18.600]  Just with gut hanging out and a tattoo going on the ribs.
[03:18.980 --> 03:20.260]  Is that what I'm visualizing right now?
[03:20.260 --> 03:22.840]  Definitely gut hanging out for sure.
[03:22.940 --> 03:25.430]  Here, let me share. Let me see if you can see. I'll share my video.
[03:25.940 --> 03:27.080]  Oh, I'd love to see.
[03:27.520 --> 03:28.460]  Okay, there you go.
[03:31.760 --> 03:32.780]  So there you go.
[03:33.160 --> 03:36.360]  That's what's going on right now.
[03:37.460 --> 03:38.040]  What did...
[03:40.660 --> 03:42.720]  What did you guys do for episode 100?
[03:50.760 --> 03:54.500]  You look like Burt Reynolds in Playgirl magazine.
[03:54.720 --> 03:57.300]  Thank you. I feel like Burt Reynolds in Playgirl magazine.
[03:57.580 --> 03:58.580]  I wish I had his hair piece.
[04:00.860 --> 04:01.900]  Oh, yeah.
[04:03.140 --> 04:03.620]  Anyway.
[04:03.960 --> 04:06.320]  Go for it.
[04:06.480 --> 04:08.500]  Can we somehow record this? It's great.
[04:09.340 --> 04:11.160]  Fucking do a screen record. I don't care.
[04:11.160 --> 04:14.440]  I am recording on my iPhone from behind.
[04:14.640 --> 04:17.040]  So I realize after I set it up, it's not going to look good.
[04:17.420 --> 04:18.760]  But, yeah.
[04:19.260 --> 04:21.020]  So anyway, this is what I'm doing for 100.
[04:21.300 --> 04:22.500]  Andrew Gavin, what do you guys got?
[04:22.920 --> 04:24.960]  It's so much bigger than I expected.
[04:25.800 --> 04:29.160]  Yeah, we sized it down.
[04:29.600 --> 04:32.420]  I had to make it way too big, actually, when I saw it.
[04:32.760 --> 04:33.360]  I shit my pants.
[04:34.680 --> 04:35.580]  Oh, my God.
[04:36.060 --> 04:38.680]  So I've never gotten a tattoo. It's hard to speak.
[04:38.680 --> 04:42.660]  I also imagine laughing is the thing you would want to avoid.
[04:43.000 --> 04:43.460]  I would assume.
[04:43.580 --> 04:46.160]  You just want to stay as still as possible.
[04:47.140 --> 04:50.560]  It's only hard to speak in certain spots.
[04:51.180 --> 04:52.940]  Tattoos tend to hurt the worst.
[04:53.260 --> 04:54.440]  In my experience.
[04:55.840 --> 04:57.420]  When it's right over bone.
[04:57.980 --> 04:58.560]  Like ribs.
[04:58.640 --> 05:00.980]  Ribs are a particularly tough spot to get it.
[05:01.860 --> 05:03.680]  Some fleshy parts can hurt a lot, too.
[05:04.180 --> 05:05.280]  Chest hurts quite a bit.
[05:05.680 --> 05:06.180]  For a boy.
[05:07.280 --> 05:08.140]  Elbows are bad.
[05:10.160 --> 05:12.980]  I hear behind the knee is a particularly rough spot.
[05:13.060 --> 05:13.860]  I've never done that.
[05:13.980 --> 05:15.080]  Not looking forward to it.
[05:16.220 --> 05:17.520]  Anyway, what's new with you guys?
[05:19.180 --> 05:23.620]  Is there any imagery that Geoff is making you think of Gavin?
[05:24.020 --> 05:25.140]  Right now, just when you look at him?
[05:25.880 --> 05:27.960]  Are there any vibes that you're getting from this?
[05:28.840 --> 05:32.500]  Something you would see on the ceiling of a cathedral.
[05:33.080 --> 05:35.620]  I don't know why. I'm getting real mermaid vibes from Geoff.
[05:35.620 --> 05:36.700]  That's why I lost it.
[05:36.780 --> 05:38.280]  It just feels very Geoff Mermaid.
[05:38.420 --> 05:40.120]  Something with the way the hands are.
[05:40.300 --> 05:43.340]  I wasn't expecting the hands up on the head.
[05:44.140 --> 05:46.100]  Keeping the arms out of the way of the ribs.
[05:46.900 --> 05:47.740]  Makes sense.
[05:47.880 --> 05:49.040]  But I just didn't consider it.
[05:49.180 --> 05:49.980]  I was caught off guard.
[05:50.440 --> 05:51.980]  Geoff's face clenched up.
[05:56.100 --> 05:57.760]  Neither of you have ever had a tattoo.
[05:58.860 --> 05:59.280]  No.
[06:00.120 --> 06:01.360]  I don't know what I would get.
[06:02.400 --> 06:04.020]  So where would you put the...
[06:04.020 --> 06:05.340]  Where was the pencil gonna go?
[06:06.180 --> 06:09.640]  The pencil is on my right calf.
[06:10.760 --> 06:13.680]  And then the Ian is on the inside of my foot.
[06:16.200 --> 06:18.240]  I'll probably just go ahead and get those two while we're here.
[06:18.640 --> 06:23.720]  So the number two, the one that was picked, is definitely in the worst place.
[06:24.300 --> 06:27.560]  Yeah, see, I was hoping that you guys would pick a different one and then I wouldn't have to get this one.
[06:27.620 --> 06:28.760]  Because this is the only bad one.
[06:28.760 --> 06:30.900]  The other two are a fucking... I could do it in my sleep.
[06:31.000 --> 06:31.620]  It's nothing.
[06:33.280 --> 06:35.760]  You're getting a tattoo you didn't want?
[06:36.960 --> 06:39.120]  No, I'm not saying I didn't get... I didn't want it.
[06:39.160 --> 06:40.040]  Obviously I want it.
[06:40.100 --> 06:43.320]  I just didn't necessarily want it right now.
[06:43.320 --> 06:44.040]  In this context.
[06:44.240 --> 06:49.700]  I mean, I want to be completely covered in tattoos, but I'm not because of...
[06:49.700 --> 06:50.560]  I don't know.
[06:51.040 --> 06:52.360]  It hurts and it's not fun.
[06:52.780 --> 06:54.540]  So you, you know...
[06:55.500 --> 06:56.840]  Do it sparingly.
[06:56.840 --> 06:58.400]  I'm so glad we went with two.
[06:58.600 --> 07:04.120]  I mean, the other visuals I can't imagine would be as good as being as caught off guard as we were.
[07:04.540 --> 07:05.140]  With that reveal.
[07:05.220 --> 07:07.400]  I guess I realized for the audience.
[07:08.640 --> 07:09.780]  One, two, and three are...
[07:09.780 --> 07:10.860]  Number one is a pencil.
[07:11.500 --> 07:12.660]  It's a number 16 pencil.
[07:13.500 --> 07:15.120]  With a bite taken out of it.
[07:15.520 --> 07:18.780]  Number two was Pedro and Don fighting.
[07:19.020 --> 07:21.440]  Right as Pedro's smushing Don's head.
[07:21.880 --> 07:22.700]  And then...
[07:22.700 --> 07:23.420]  Oh, fuck.
[07:24.160 --> 07:26.680]  You can hear the faint buzz of the tattoo.
[07:26.940 --> 07:28.440]  That was a good spot.
[07:28.880 --> 07:30.960]  And then tattoo number three is the Ian face.
[07:31.320 --> 07:33.240]  Looking up. Standardized nose.
[07:34.480 --> 07:35.200]  Oh, man.
[07:35.820 --> 07:36.420]  It's incredible.
[07:37.680 --> 07:40.020]  I feel... I'm glad I didn't even attempt.
[07:40.520 --> 07:42.680]  So I had two things in mind for this episode.
[07:43.100 --> 07:44.660]  One of them would antagonize Geoff.
[07:44.800 --> 07:45.820]  So I didn't want to do that.
[07:46.180 --> 07:47.920]  And the other one would antagonize the audience.
[07:48.040 --> 07:49.560]  Which also felt rude to do.
[07:50.160 --> 07:52.460]  On such a special episode 100.
[07:52.460 --> 07:54.420]  I just didn't want to annoy anybody.
[07:54.600 --> 07:55.980]  So I don't have anything planned.
[07:56.100 --> 07:58.880]  But I know, Gavin, you've had this amazing story.
[07:59.380 --> 08:01.200]  That we've been teasing for weeks.
[08:01.920 --> 08:03.380]  Well, you've been annoying the audience, Andrew.
[08:03.420 --> 08:04.420]  Since you didn't eat the pencil.
[08:04.680 --> 08:05.660]  So what's different now?
[08:05.820 --> 08:07.840]  Well, you can trust me.
[08:07.860 --> 08:08.860]  I can take it to other levels.
[08:09.040 --> 08:10.820]  We can go to some other places with it.
[08:10.880 --> 08:11.540]  I didn't want to.
[08:11.740 --> 08:13.240]  This is a celebratory episode.
[08:13.880 --> 08:14.680]  Geoff's getting a tattoo.
[08:14.880 --> 08:15.620]  It's good vibes.
[08:16.040 --> 08:16.840]  Good vibes?
[08:16.960 --> 08:20.280]  I want a new guest at the Previously On Voice.
[08:20.920 --> 08:21.260]  Oh, yeah.
[08:21.720 --> 08:23.280]  Let's do the Previously On Guests.
[08:23.520 --> 08:25.000]  Geoff, have you thought of a new guest?
[08:26.140 --> 08:26.940]  Is it...
[08:26.940 --> 08:27.480]  Go ahead.
[08:29.160 --> 08:30.580]  You're allowed to ask a question as well.
[08:30.640 --> 08:32.660]  You get a question and a guess.
[08:33.060 --> 08:33.520]  Oh, okay.
[08:33.900 --> 08:37.260]  Is it a public figure?
[08:39.200 --> 08:39.600]  No.
[08:40.460 --> 08:40.700]  Okay.
[08:41.480 --> 08:43.620]  Is it someone...
[08:43.620 --> 08:45.860]  Is it someone we've heard on the show before?
[08:46.000 --> 08:46.540]  Did I ask that?
[08:47.220 --> 08:48.500]  Someone you've heard on the show.
[08:48.520 --> 08:50.360]  Could you be a little bit more specific?
[08:50.880 --> 08:53.640]  Has their voice been in an episode of F*** Space?
[08:54.000 --> 08:54.300]  No.
[08:55.220 --> 08:55.820]  Oh, God.
[08:58.520 --> 09:00.460]  It's been very fun to see the guesses.
[09:00.860 --> 09:02.040]  There have been a lot of posts
[09:02.040 --> 09:04.140]  and different threads about who the voice could be.
[09:04.200 --> 09:05.380]  It's been very entertaining to follow.
[09:06.300 --> 09:07.100]  Is it...
[09:07.100 --> 09:08.800]  My guess will be it's somebody from
[09:09.380 --> 09:10.360]  My Hubby's Bagels.
[09:11.760 --> 09:13.160]  That's your guess?
[09:13.600 --> 09:14.240]  Your official guess?
[09:14.460 --> 09:15.460]  No, that is incorrect.
[09:16.200 --> 09:18.700]  Is it a descendant of the inventor
[09:18.700 --> 09:19.520]  of the buttplug?
[09:19.620 --> 09:20.780]  You don't get another question.
[09:22.780 --> 09:24.300]  Unless that's who you're guessing.
[09:24.560 --> 09:25.140]  That's my guess.
[09:25.920 --> 09:28.280]  I don't know the ancestry of the
[09:28.280 --> 09:30.420]  buttplug inventor, so I don't feel
[09:30.420 --> 09:31.920]  comfortable giving you an answer to that.
[09:32.040 --> 09:34.200]  I would assume no. I would be shocked
[09:34.200 --> 09:35.780]  if that was the case, but there have been
[09:35.780 --> 09:37.540]  weirder coincidences with this show.
[09:37.540 --> 09:39.360]  So I don't feel like I could fully
[09:39.360 --> 09:41.800]  rule it out. Highly unlikely.
[09:42.640 --> 09:43.460]  You guys have to go again
[09:43.460 --> 09:44.800]  next episode. We do.
[09:45.680 --> 09:48.040]  It's been crazy. Some of the guesses...
[09:48.040 --> 09:49.700]  I am seeing guesses from people
[09:49.700 --> 09:51.540]  that are way more creative than I could have
[09:51.540 --> 09:52.280]  ever come up with.
[09:52.800 --> 09:55.440]  Let me ask you this, not as an official question,
[09:55.540 --> 09:56.700]  but just as a conversation.
[09:57.200 --> 09:59.580]  Has a comment leaver got it right?
[10:00.160 --> 10:02.060]  Nobody has gotten it exactly right.
[10:02.600 --> 10:03.460]  That's interesting.
[10:03.740 --> 10:04.580]  That's interesting.
[10:05.920 --> 10:06.380]  There's been
[10:06.380 --> 10:08.400]  some people that I'm like, wow!
[10:08.720 --> 10:10.100]  I'm surprised you're that close.
[10:10.240 --> 10:12.740]  But yeah, there's not been a definitive correct
[10:12.740 --> 10:14.980]  guess. As of yet.
[10:15.340 --> 10:16.620]  At this rate, are we going to be
[10:16.620 --> 10:18.060]  all the way up to 200 before we get there?
[10:18.820 --> 10:20.740]  I feel like you guys asked some great questions
[10:20.740 --> 10:21.560]  and really narrowed it down.
[10:22.000 --> 10:23.340]  It's an unsolvable riddle.
[10:24.120 --> 10:26.300]  I'm going to need a running document, though,
[10:26.420 --> 10:28.580]  of everything we know before I make each guess.
[10:29.140 --> 10:30.680]  It's going to be hard to keep track of.
[10:31.120 --> 10:32.460]  I don't remember everybody
[10:32.460 --> 10:34.220]  you've guessed, never mind the questions.
[10:36.120 --> 10:38.100]  My favorite one, I think, is Nick.
[10:38.260 --> 10:39.960]  Some people thought it was Nick. Can you imagine
[10:39.960 --> 10:42.180]  how wild of a... just bad?
[10:42.560 --> 10:44.740]  It'd be such a lame reveal if it's just Nick.
[10:46.160 --> 10:46.640]  What's
[10:46.640 --> 10:47.360]  lame about Nick?
[10:49.120 --> 10:50.960]  There'd just be such a strange
[10:52.140 --> 10:52.620]  thing.
[10:52.800 --> 10:54.540]  And nothing against Nick. Nick is great.
[10:54.660 --> 10:56.860]  I love Nick. Nick's fantastic.
[10:57.620 --> 10:58.520]  But just teasing...
[10:59.180 --> 11:01.000]  It'd be like if I had you do the voice, Gavin.
[11:01.000 --> 11:02.960]  What a lame reveal that would be.
[11:03.260 --> 11:03.720]  Is it Gavin?
[11:04.500 --> 11:05.200]  Is it me?
[11:06.180 --> 11:07.020]  Is it you?
[11:10.820 --> 11:12.300]  That would be amazing if it was.
[11:12.400 --> 11:14.920]  Oh, sweet. My ribs are done. That was fucking fast.
[11:15.140 --> 11:16.400]  Already? Wow.
[11:17.240 --> 11:18.240]  Are you moving straight on?
[11:18.840 --> 11:20.380]  Yeah, might as well just do the rest of them, right?
[11:20.980 --> 11:22.020]  I mean, it's not
[11:22.460 --> 11:25.020]  impeding the progress of the podcast
[11:25.020 --> 11:25.620]  at all, is it?
[11:27.000 --> 11:28.080]  I don't think so.
[11:29.100 --> 11:30.160]  I don't even know
[11:30.160 --> 11:32.120]  if that question was for me, but I'm going to say no.
[11:32.200 --> 11:34.080]  This is great. I have an update
[11:34.080 --> 11:35.800]  from... we were talking about
[11:35.800 --> 11:38.020]  stuff not arriving for months. That was
[11:38.020 --> 11:40.280]  that West Elm conversation. Oh!
[11:40.280 --> 11:41.980]  I've been meaning to ask that. Yeah, did Geoff
[11:41.980 --> 11:44.020]  get the basket? Did you ever get your basket,
[11:44.160 --> 11:46.160]  Geoff? I did. The picnic basket?
[11:46.240 --> 11:48.500]  Yeah, we did get it. Okay. Oh, how was it?
[11:48.560 --> 11:49.900]  I haven't used it yet, but it's lovely.
[11:50.360 --> 11:51.820]  Great. It's as advertised.
[11:52.240 --> 11:54.080]  And I got the Dead by Daylight
[11:54.080 --> 11:55.120]  statue delivered.
[11:55.900 --> 11:57.280]  When? Last week
[11:57.280 --> 11:59.100]  after having placed the order in
[11:59.100 --> 12:01.400]  what was it? January 2020.
[12:01.840 --> 12:02.640]  Just arrived.
[12:03.200 --> 12:04.840]  And how is the Dead by Daylight statue?
[12:05.360 --> 12:06.940]  Uh, it's good. Light's up. It's nice.
[12:08.200 --> 12:08.920]  Eric asked,
[12:09.100 --> 12:10.660]  is that your crazy story? No.
[12:11.240 --> 12:12.300]  That's not the story.
[12:14.220 --> 12:15.100]  I don't...
[12:15.100 --> 12:17.220]  Geoff's just walking with the mic in his hand.
[12:18.220 --> 12:19.160]  Just in his box.
[12:20.120 --> 12:21.320]  I'm not in my box or something.
[12:21.580 --> 12:23.120]  I'm in the...
[12:23.500 --> 12:25.220]  He's wearing his smallest
[12:25.780 --> 12:27.420]  shorts just walking around
[12:27.420 --> 12:29.320]  his house carrying the microphone.
[12:29.600 --> 12:31.340]  This is so insane.
[12:31.600 --> 12:33.300]  These are the swim trunks I wear every day
[12:33.300 --> 12:34.260]  of my life in the summer.
[12:35.960 --> 12:36.680]  So 80s.
[12:38.440 --> 12:39.440]  What does that mean?
[12:40.740 --> 12:41.460]  What's wrong
[12:41.460 --> 12:43.220]  with the 80s? I grew up in the 80s. The 80s were
[12:43.220 --> 12:45.700]  fucking awesome. Yeah, you're like an 80s footballer.
[12:46.440 --> 12:47.360]  Thank you. I appreciate
[12:47.360 --> 12:48.380]  that. I'll take that as a compliment.
[12:48.740 --> 12:50.260]  How do you want me to sit for this one, Derek?
[12:52.940 --> 12:53.520]  I was
[12:54.000 --> 12:55.460]  trying to think of the thing
[12:55.460 --> 12:57.540]  that we had to be here
[12:57.540 --> 12:59.420]  at this specific time to record this episode
[12:59.420 --> 13:01.640]  because Geoff had booked something. I had no
[13:01.640 --> 13:03.380]  idea what it was. I did not expect this.
[13:03.880 --> 13:05.920]  No. Well, I'm glad. This is incredible.
[13:06.180 --> 13:06.980]  I was supposed to.
[13:08.560 --> 13:09.880]  Now this angle is terrible
[13:09.880 --> 13:10.720]  because it's like
[13:11.400 --> 13:12.560]  we're in bed with you.
[13:16.180 --> 13:17.420]  I don't enjoy this.
[13:17.940 --> 13:19.540]  It's a lot more fun the other way.
[13:19.540 --> 13:20.680]  With the big spoon.
[13:24.020 --> 13:25.720]  Why don't you tell your story, Gavin?
[13:26.840 --> 13:27.480]  Well, I got some
[13:27.480 --> 13:29.520]  visual aids for it, so if you can't see the screen,
[13:29.580 --> 13:30.600]  I'll wait for you to turn over.
[13:30.940 --> 13:32.760]  I can look over.
[13:33.500 --> 13:35.420]  Is there any update outside of the fact
[13:35.420 --> 13:36.120]  you got it?
[13:37.180 --> 13:39.140]  The statue? Yeah. Nope.
[13:39.620 --> 13:40.900]  I figured I'd let you know.
[13:41.360 --> 13:42.680]  That was quite a long time, though. It was like
[13:43.780 --> 13:44.900]  800 days or something?
[13:45.220 --> 13:47.620]  It was ridiculous. 800 days.
[13:48.100 --> 13:48.900]  It's pretty long.
[13:49.020 --> 13:51.100]  It's not even a thank me later set up.
[13:51.200 --> 13:53.640]  That was just the world. The world just did that to you.
[13:54.080 --> 13:55.160]  Don't even need that business.
[13:55.860 --> 13:57.500]  You should turn around and sell it on eBay
[13:57.500 --> 13:59.580]  for twice the cost and say that you...
[14:00.020 --> 14:01.640]  I'm sure there are other people out there that are waiting
[14:01.640 --> 14:03.100]  hundreds of days for their statues.
[14:03.620 --> 14:04.560]  Like you're gonna do with your fridge?
[14:05.040 --> 14:06.100]  Yeah, like I'm gonna do with the fridge.
[14:06.680 --> 14:07.860]  What did you call it? Profiteering?
[14:08.240 --> 14:10.320]  How many Bo Burnham vinyls do you have at this point? Three.
[14:10.960 --> 14:11.940]  Still have them? All three?
[14:13.760 --> 14:14.680]  Do you want one?
[14:15.380 --> 14:16.540]  I'm not opposed.
[14:16.780 --> 14:18.120]  I love that you have three.
[14:18.300 --> 14:20.620]  I assumed you would do something with it by this point.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.120]  I've already sent you something different this week.
[14:23.180 --> 14:23.960]  Did... okay.
[14:24.380 --> 14:25.960]  Did it come through Amazon?
[14:26.940 --> 14:27.140]  Yeah.
[14:27.860 --> 14:29.100]  Oh boy.
[14:29.860 --> 14:31.380]  What happened? Did you reject it?
[14:31.920 --> 14:34.380]  Well, I got a call
[14:34.380 --> 14:35.440]  yesterday
[14:36.320 --> 14:38.040]  from someone that
[14:38.040 --> 14:40.600]  their call display was Ontario.
[14:40.900 --> 14:42.520]  Which I found very suspicious.
[14:42.520 --> 14:44.000]  It was just a region.
[14:44.680 --> 14:46.680]  And they called and they left a voicemail.
[14:47.000 --> 14:47.740]  It was hard to understand.
[14:47.820 --> 14:49.060]  It was breaking up and stuff.
[14:49.360 --> 14:50.900]  But they did say, I'm from Amazon.
[14:51.160 --> 14:52.560]  I'm trying to find where you live.
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.460]  And I thought, I didn't order anything from Amazon.
[14:55.780 --> 14:56.620]  This is suspicious.
[14:57.760 --> 14:59.260]  So I don't...
[14:59.260 --> 15:01.680]  Maybe check the status of that order?
[15:02.000 --> 15:02.580]  Oh shit.
[15:03.160 --> 15:03.920]  You should maybe see.
[15:04.320 --> 15:05.360]  Because I don't have it.
[15:05.660 --> 15:07.780]  But I definitely got called twice yesterday
[15:07.780 --> 15:10.160]  from somebody listed as Ontario.
[15:13.520 --> 15:15.880]  Well, I was sort of hoping it would arrive in time.
[15:17.120 --> 15:18.200]  Oh, it says shipped.
[15:18.820 --> 15:19.620]  That's what it says.
[15:20.320 --> 15:21.000]  So it might be unrelated.
[15:21.280 --> 15:23.640]  I did get to talk about something
[15:23.640 --> 15:24.900]  that will already be well out.
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.320]  I received the regulation listener
[15:27.320 --> 15:28.880]  and comment lever shirts.
[15:29.180 --> 15:31.580]  Oh, I haven't gotten those yet. I haven't either.
[15:31.880 --> 15:32.780]  Yeah, they're great.
[15:33.180 --> 15:35.040]  I mean, they're as designed.
[15:35.040 --> 15:37.720]  They're basic and they say what they should say on them.
[15:37.920 --> 15:39.000]  So maybe it's that.
[15:39.080 --> 15:40.620]  But that'd be wild if Amazon delivered that.
[15:40.680 --> 15:41.040]  I don't know.
[15:42.060 --> 15:45.080]  I'll keep my eyes open, though, for the Amazon package.
[15:45.640 --> 15:46.800]  We did a thing.
[15:47.240 --> 15:48.540]  Eric and I did a thing the other day.
[15:48.920 --> 15:49.320]  Yeah?
[15:49.780 --> 15:51.680]  We had a little bros night.
[15:52.180 --> 15:54.900]  Oh my god, I'm so glad we're going to talk about this.
[15:55.200 --> 15:56.760]  Oh yeah, how was bros night?
[15:57.220 --> 15:58.440]  Well, the film was amazing.
[15:58.760 --> 15:59.260]  Wasn't it, Eric?
[16:01.460 --> 16:02.680]  Ambulance might be
[16:02.680 --> 16:04.960]  the best movie I've ever seen
[16:04.960 --> 16:05.700]  in theatres.
[16:08.100 --> 16:08.660]  Absolutely
[16:10.360 --> 16:10.920]  unhinged
[16:10.920 --> 16:12.940]  film. I can't believe it exists
[16:12.940 --> 16:14.600]  and I had such a good time
[16:14.600 --> 16:16.660]  in this empty ass
[16:16.660 --> 16:17.140]  theatre.
[16:17.560 --> 16:20.540]  I loved it. I had such a good time.
[16:20.640 --> 16:22.720]  I genuinely believe that Michael Bay turns up
[16:22.720 --> 16:24.880]  on set and opens the case of lenses
[16:24.880 --> 16:26.820]  and takes the 18mm
[16:26.820 --> 16:28.840]  and the 35mm, but all the wide lenses
[16:28.840 --> 16:30.900]  and just throws them into the
[16:30.900 --> 16:32.760]  sea at the beginning of each filming day.
[16:33.340 --> 16:34.940]  Every single shot was like
[16:34.940 --> 16:36.820]  up Jake Gyllenhaal's nostrils
[16:36.820 --> 16:38.840]  or like in his eye. It's like
[16:38.840 --> 16:40.760]  the guy hates zooming out now.
[16:42.380 --> 16:43.040]  Is it
[16:43.040 --> 16:44.920]  a typical Michael Bay movie where the movie
[16:44.920 --> 16:46.920]  ends and then they surprise you with a whole other
[16:46.920 --> 16:47.660]  movie at the end?
[16:48.520 --> 16:50.640]  I missed the end, I'll be honest.
[16:50.780 --> 16:52.300]  I need to piss.
[16:53.140 --> 16:54.660]  No, it is
[16:54.660 --> 16:56.940]  I will say it is the
[16:56.940 --> 16:58.960]  most Michael Bay movie I think he's
[16:58.960 --> 17:00.980]  ever made in the way that it
[17:00.980 --> 17:02.840]  looks and feels and moves.
[17:02.960 --> 17:04.680]  It is like
[17:05.300 --> 17:07.180]  it's insane how crazy
[17:07.180 --> 17:08.300]  that movie is.
[17:08.840 --> 17:11.120]  Geoff, there is three minutes of exposition
[17:11.120 --> 17:12.580]  and then they are like
[17:12.580 --> 17:15.240]  off to the fucking races. And the exposition
[17:15.240 --> 17:16.920]  at the beginning is the funniest
[17:16.920 --> 17:19.240]  exposition you can do. It is
[17:19.240 --> 17:21.000]  my wife needs
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.120]  experimental surgery insurance
[17:23.120 --> 17:25.160]  provider and then they hang up on him
[17:25.160 --> 17:27.420]  and then he goes, time to go to work
[17:27.420 --> 17:28.960]  and it's insane.
[17:32.040 --> 17:33.460]  I hate getting up to
[17:33.460 --> 17:35.120]  piss, especially the first time I've seen a movie.
[17:35.400 --> 17:37.040]  But that movie was so freaking long
[17:37.040 --> 17:38.300]  and I accidentally
[17:40.200 --> 17:41.360]  misjudged how big
[17:41.360 --> 17:43.360]  a 32 ounce beer was
[17:44.200 --> 17:45.500]  and I ordered it on the counter.
[17:46.940 --> 17:47.500]  So by the
[17:47.500 --> 17:49.500]  end of it, I was writhing in my
[17:49.500 --> 17:51.140]  seat. I was like, this movie needs to end.
[17:51.300 --> 17:53.520]  We must be at the end. And then 20 minutes later
[17:53.520 --> 17:54.660]  I was like, oh God.
[17:54.660 --> 17:56.480]  So I just got up
[17:56.480 --> 17:58.780]  probably 3 minutes
[17:58.780 --> 18:00.120]  before the credits.
[18:00.420 --> 18:02.520]  And then you came back when the credits
[18:02.520 --> 18:04.520]  started, but the credits only
[18:05.280 --> 18:06.940]  were so short.
[18:06.980 --> 18:07.920]  I didn't give a shit.
[18:08.080 --> 18:10.580]  The credits were 15 seconds long
[18:10.580 --> 18:11.680]  and then it was like, get out.
[18:12.280 --> 18:14.480]  I got up probably 60
[18:14.480 --> 18:16.580]  maybe 65 seconds away
[18:16.580 --> 18:18.620]  from pissing my pants. That was
[18:18.620 --> 18:20.540]  the timer I was on. And it was that
[18:20.540 --> 18:22.780]  stage of piss where your blood is so full
[18:22.780 --> 18:24.560]  if you could feel the stretch in it
[18:24.560 --> 18:26.560]  and you're almost like waddling and you're trying to
[18:26.560 --> 18:28.780]  unbutton the shorts to give it
[18:28.780 --> 18:30.780]  a little bit of freedom. And that's when all of the
[18:30.780 --> 18:32.680]  staff of the movie theater decided they wanted
[18:32.680 --> 18:34.460]  selfies and I was like
[18:34.460 --> 18:36.820]  oh my God, yes, but we gotta keep moving
[18:36.820 --> 18:38.820]  I'm gonna piss myself. So we did a little
[18:38.820 --> 18:40.600]  waddle run of selfies as I went through.
[18:41.160 --> 18:42.860]  I made it back for the 2 second credits.
[18:43.360 --> 18:44.180]  But it was a good experience.
[18:44.760 --> 18:46.640]  Andrew enjoyed a video
[18:46.640 --> 18:48.660]  I sent him of TPG. It was a
[18:48.660 --> 18:50.860]  phenomenal video. It delivered
[18:50.860 --> 18:52.940]  in ways, should we like get into the
[18:52.940 --> 18:55.060]  specifics of the context of that video?
[18:55.200 --> 18:56.300]  And like leading into it? Yeah.
[18:56.760 --> 18:58.860]  So you guys saw it with TPG
[18:58.860 --> 19:00.820]  who is, I think, in my mind
[19:00.820 --> 19:02.800]  at least, famous on the show as
[19:02.800 --> 19:04.800]  being the you fuck with Hobbes and Shaw guy.
[19:05.040 --> 19:07.060]  Which is incredible. Big fan
[19:07.060 --> 19:08.800]  of him. Gavin and I were talking
[19:08.800 --> 19:10.940]  what do we think TPG's top
[19:10.940 --> 19:12.480]  10 movies of all time would be?
[19:12.680 --> 19:14.940]  It has to be a phenomenal list. If you fuck
[19:14.940 --> 19:16.860]  with Hobbes and Shaw, you got a great top
[19:16.860 --> 19:18.900]  10 list. And we're going back and
[19:18.900 --> 19:20.780]  forth. And Gavin opened with Bad
[19:20.780 --> 19:22.760]  Boys 2. And I agreed.
[19:22.900 --> 19:24.920]  I was like, that feels like it would be in the top
[19:24.920 --> 19:26.740]  10. That's a great pick. We basically
[19:26.740 --> 19:28.780]  sat there before we went out, like Andrew
[19:28.780 --> 19:31.020]  and I guessing TPG's top 10 list.
[19:32.200 --> 19:32.800]  And then
[19:32.800 --> 19:34.560]  Gavin said The Raid 2.
[19:34.920 --> 19:37.040]  And I was like, that's a great movie.
[19:37.180 --> 19:38.920]  I love The Raid 2. But it just
[19:38.920 --> 19:40.680]  feels so strange.
[19:40.800 --> 19:43.040]  That's such a strangely specific movie
[19:43.040 --> 19:44.660]  to be in your top 10.
[19:45.260 --> 19:46.800]  And then Gavin sent me
[19:46.800 --> 19:48.920]  a video of TPG
[19:48.920 --> 19:51.020]  not discussing his top 10,
[19:51.360 --> 19:52.880]  discussing his top 2
[19:52.880 --> 19:54.920]  and what potentially might be
[19:54.920 --> 19:56.680]  in the third spot. Which is
[19:56.680 --> 19:59.020]  amazing. It's a phenomenal video.
[19:59.300 --> 20:01.240]  If you were to guess, what do you think TPG's
[20:01.240 --> 20:03.080]  first greatest film of all
[20:03.080 --> 20:03.640]  time is, Geoff?
[20:04.580 --> 20:06.380]  I think it's either going to be
[20:07.040 --> 20:08.240]  The Rock
[20:09.500 --> 20:10.100]  or
[20:12.220 --> 20:13.220]  Con Air
[20:14.940 --> 20:15.540]  or
[20:15.540 --> 20:17.220]  or Bad Boys 2
[20:17.220 --> 20:19.760]  would be up there. Maybe Fast 5
[20:19.760 --> 20:21.000]  would be in there.
[20:21.240 --> 20:23.160]  Or it's going to be like Citizen Kane
[20:23.160 --> 20:24.460]  and Sunset Boulevard.
[20:25.460 --> 20:27.240]  Totally on Golden Pond.
[20:27.560 --> 20:28.900]  Something you totally wouldn't expect.
[20:29.420 --> 20:31.380]  You kind of nailed it. His number one
[20:31.380 --> 20:33.380]  the greatest film of all time from The Goat
[20:33.380 --> 20:34.540]  is Bad Boys 2.
[20:34.820 --> 20:37.120]  The greatest cinematic masterpiece of all time.
[20:37.560 --> 20:38.800]  Then his number 2,
[20:39.360 --> 20:41.180]  which I love so much,
[20:41.260 --> 20:43.140]  he's like, for all the film snobs out there,
[20:43.880 --> 20:44.880]  G1. We going
[20:44.880 --> 20:45.960]  Godfather 1.
[20:47.760 --> 20:48.440]  He called
[20:49.000 --> 20:50.320]  the first Godfather
[20:51.020 --> 20:51.460]  G1.
[20:52.620 --> 20:55.000]  He's the only person on earth who likes
[20:55.000 --> 20:56.220]  Godfather 1 more than 2.
[20:56.640 --> 20:59.160]  He said, this is maybe my favorite part
[20:59.160 --> 21:00.620]  of the video that Gavin sent me.
[21:00.900 --> 21:03.200]  He said, okay, now we're going to 3. The list really
[21:03.200 --> 21:05.220]  drops off at this point. It's your own
[21:05.220 --> 21:05.960]  top 10.
[21:06.500 --> 21:09.100]  What does that mean? Why does it drop off
[21:09.100 --> 21:11.160]  significantly? And then he couldn't
[21:11.160 --> 21:13.140]  decide. It drops off significantly
[21:13.140 --> 21:15.420]  and then he said, this is in the running
[21:15.420 --> 21:16.540]  for number 3.
[21:17.000 --> 21:18.200]  And it was The Raid 2.
[21:18.560 --> 21:20.880]  He said that
[21:20.880 --> 21:23.180]  him and like 20 guys saw
[21:23.180 --> 21:25.240]  The Raid 2 and in the final
[21:25.240 --> 21:27.040]  fight sequence, everybody
[21:27.040 --> 21:29.160]  stood up and was watching it and they felt like
[21:29.160 --> 21:30.940]  it was real. Which is insane.
[21:31.160 --> 21:32.800]  That's how much he likes Bad Boys 2.
[21:33.280 --> 21:35.180]  He thought he watched a brawl in a
[21:35.180 --> 21:36.520]  theater like it was real life.
[21:36.880 --> 21:39.040]  People dying and it's 3. It's not
[21:39.040 --> 21:40.620]  even 3. It might be 3.
[21:41.020 --> 21:41.960]  It's a distant 3.
[21:42.600 --> 21:44.700]  I was pretty much
[21:44.700 --> 21:45.820]  correct on my guesses.
[21:46.100 --> 21:48.780]  He was saying everything I said to you and I just
[21:48.780 --> 21:50.520]  laughed and just stopped the recording.
[21:50.740 --> 21:52.140]  Because I was like, I've got everything I need.
[21:53.380 --> 21:55.120]  And then we had to go and watch the movie.
[21:55.940 --> 21:56.940]  Oh, and then you guys
[21:56.940 --> 21:58.740]  were seeing it in 40x is how it was
[21:58.740 --> 22:00.800]  explained going into it. And I was so
[22:00.800 --> 22:02.880]  jealous of like, I don't have that available
[22:02.880 --> 22:04.900]  to me. I knew Eric was having
[22:04.900 --> 22:06.160]  a great time watching it.
[22:06.160 --> 22:08.360]  I can't watch it with TPG sadly
[22:08.360 --> 22:10.300]  so I feel like I'm missing out on the experience
[22:10.300 --> 22:12.360]  but just the seats alone, it's like that's a whole
[22:12.360 --> 22:13.320]  layer I feel like I'm missing.
[22:13.880 --> 22:16.180]  To then learn that you guys didn't even see it in that way.
[22:16.260 --> 22:17.960]  You just saw it in a normal setting.
[22:18.400 --> 22:20.580]  Yeah, what was that about Eric? Why did we go to that one?
[22:20.940 --> 22:22.060]  I think...
[22:22.060 --> 22:24.000]  Okay, so I will say that Tim
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.320]  texted me the next day and the text
[22:26.320 --> 22:27.520]  just read, bro,
[22:28.160 --> 22:30.160]  that theater? Hidden gem.
[22:30.380 --> 22:31.380]  Might be top 10.
[22:31.700 --> 22:34.200]  So I think he just really likes that theater
[22:34.200 --> 22:36.300]  but also, I thought we were seeing it
[22:36.300 --> 22:38.260]  in 4DX. Turns out, that
[22:38.260 --> 22:40.580]  movie is not in 4DX.
[22:40.860 --> 22:41.800]  That's insane.
[22:42.200 --> 22:44.060]  Can you believe Ambulance
[22:44.060 --> 22:46.200]  is not in 4DX? We saw it
[22:46.200 --> 22:48.060]  in a regular theater and it was the most
[22:48.060 --> 22:50.220]  thrilling time I might have ever had at a movie.
[22:50.820 --> 22:52.180]  Imagine those FPV
[22:52.180 --> 22:54.080]  drone shots in 4DX, it would have been amazing.
[22:54.160 --> 22:56.260]  No, I wouldn't have been able to live tweet
[22:56.260 --> 22:58.360]  the whole... there's no one in that theater. I live
[22:58.360 --> 23:00.120]  tweeted the whole movie because no one was there
[23:00.120 --> 23:01.820]  and I loved every second of it.
[23:01.820 --> 23:03.280]  Oh, yeah. Oh, my
[23:04.320 --> 23:05.840]  Twitter that night was
[23:06.460 --> 23:08.080]  on fire. Insane.
[23:08.740 --> 23:09.820]  Dude, I loved it.
[23:09.880 --> 23:11.140]  I loved it. I had such a good time.
[23:11.700 --> 23:13.820]  And you said the movie was... the theater was
[23:13.820 --> 23:15.780]  empty? Dude, there were like... how many
[23:15.780 --> 23:17.300]  more people were there in that theater, Gavin?
[23:17.740 --> 23:19.960]  Three? Maybe. Was this opening weekend?
[23:20.300 --> 23:21.900]  Oh, yeah. That was like the day it came out.
[23:25.120 --> 23:27.900]  I want to see it so badly. I need to see Ambulance.
[23:28.320 --> 23:30.160]  I don't want to see it at all.
[23:30.160 --> 23:32.200]  Nothing about that trailer looked
[23:32.200 --> 23:34.380]  good to me. It's awesome.
[23:34.940 --> 23:36.340]  It is unhinged.
[23:36.440 --> 23:38.160]  You have to... I want
[23:38.160 --> 23:39.880]  everyone I know to see this movie.
[23:40.160 --> 23:42.000]  It is like
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.260]  there's people who are like
[23:44.260 --> 23:45.780]  oh, yeah, I only watch cinema.
[23:46.120 --> 23:48.200]  This takes cinema to a
[23:48.200 --> 23:50.300]  place where I didn't know it could go. It was
[23:50.300 --> 23:50.860]  incredible.
[23:51.680 --> 23:54.160]  I don't know anything about it. I've somehow
[23:54.160 --> 23:56.140]  avoided all the trailers. I just know it's
[23:56.140 --> 23:58.340]  an action movie with Michael Bay called Ambulance.
[23:58.340 --> 24:00.480]  I saw somebody make a joke tweet
[24:00.480 --> 24:02.480]  that was like, this movie is crazier
[24:02.480 --> 24:04.540]  than I realized. I didn't know the lead character's name
[24:04.540 --> 24:06.480]  was Michael J. Ambulance. And I had to
[24:06.480 --> 24:08.480]  look up to see if that was true. It's the type
[24:08.480 --> 24:10.360]  of movie where if that was true
[24:10.360 --> 24:11.900]  it wouldn't faze me at all.
[24:12.120 --> 24:14.400]  It feels like it could happen. I need to see it.
[24:14.420 --> 24:16.320]  I'm excited to watch it. I was jealous
[24:16.320 --> 24:18.500]  of your great evening with TPG.
[24:19.460 --> 24:20.180]  Yeah, I wish you were there.
[24:20.340 --> 24:21.180]  I wish everyone was there.
[24:21.880 --> 24:24.380]  It would be an amazing experience. I wanted to
[24:24.380 --> 24:25.780]  be in the theater with The Raid 2.
[24:25.780 --> 24:27.840]  I think the thing we all missed
[24:27.840 --> 24:29.160]  witnessing that live fight.
[24:29.260 --> 24:31.680]  I feel like the thing that Tim explained
[24:31.680 --> 24:33.420]  to us later is that
[24:33.420 --> 24:35.740]  he wasn't sure if everyone else
[24:35.740 --> 24:37.680]  was standing or if he was the only one
[24:37.680 --> 24:39.560]  standing believing the movie was real.
[24:40.400 --> 24:41.780]  But either way, he
[24:41.780 --> 24:43.880]  loved it. It's a great movie.
[24:44.220 --> 24:45.340]  The Raid 2 is fucking awesome.
[24:46.140 --> 24:46.960]  Amazing fight scenes.
[24:47.640 --> 24:49.700]  How are you doing, Geoff? I'm good. I'm trying to
[24:49.700 --> 24:51.600]  take pictures of my tattoos for you guys. Oh, nice.
[24:51.740 --> 24:53.380]  Wait, tattoos? You got the second one?
[24:53.380 --> 24:54.620]  I got all three.
[24:55.100 --> 24:56.480]  He's already got all three.
[24:58.980 --> 24:59.440]  That's incredible.
[25:00.100 --> 25:01.440]  We're 25 minutes into
[25:01.440 --> 25:02.140]  the episode.
[25:04.680 --> 25:05.560]  I didn't
[25:05.560 --> 25:06.660]  expect it to take all day.
[25:07.480 --> 25:09.500]  I didn't expect it to take 20
[25:09.500 --> 25:11.480]  minutes. I was wondering
[25:11.480 --> 25:13.240]  if we'd be able to get all three in.
[25:13.320 --> 25:15.420]  I thought, too, all three is wild.
[25:15.600 --> 25:17.560]  I wonder if you didn't say anything, how many
[25:17.560 --> 25:19.420]  tattoos you could get within an hour without
[25:19.420 --> 25:21.440]  us knowing at all. That'd be an amazing
[25:21.440 --> 25:23.560]  reveal that you've gotten, like, 15 tattoos
[25:24.240 --> 25:25.580]  from the beginning to the end of the
[25:25.580 --> 25:27.600]  episode. The moment
[25:27.600 --> 25:29.540]  the camera turned on might have been the greatest
[25:29.540 --> 25:31.300]  reveal in Fuckface history.
[25:31.680 --> 25:33.640]  That was the funniest thing I've ever seen.
[25:33.900 --> 25:34.760]  And cinema history.
[25:35.920 --> 25:37.600]  Like, there is no reveal that
[25:37.600 --> 25:38.200]  could top that.
[25:39.240 --> 25:41.520]  Just every reveal now, that's all I'm going to think about.
[25:42.460 --> 25:43.740]  Geoff on his side
[25:43.740 --> 25:44.860]  with his hands on his head.
[25:45.600 --> 25:47.260]  I guess something else we should talk about,
[25:47.360 --> 25:49.620]  just very briefly, I guess, is
[25:50.500 --> 25:51.740]  there's somebody in the community
[25:51.740 --> 25:52.860]  made a game for us.
[25:53.100 --> 25:55.620]  That's surprisingly fun. What was that? I saw the link to that, but I couldn't do it
[25:55.620 --> 25:56.400]  on my phone. What was that?
[25:57.020 --> 25:59.520]  I had to use my desktop to play it.
[25:59.620 --> 26:01.980]  Just off the browser. It's a...
[26:01.980 --> 26:03.680]  I don't know how to describe the game,
[26:03.760 --> 26:04.340]  but it's...
[26:05.600 --> 26:07.660]  It's from somebody named Michael's Game Lab.
[26:08.460 --> 26:09.180]  What was it called?
[26:09.560 --> 26:11.000]  It's called Fuckface Knob Drop.
[26:11.660 --> 26:12.760]  And it's like...
[26:14.920 --> 26:15.560]  It's a game
[26:15.560 --> 26:17.760]  where, like, things fall down. So you have to collect...
[26:17.760 --> 26:20.160]  You have to eat burgers, hot dogs,
[26:20.220 --> 26:21.960]  and waffles while avoiding
[26:22.620 --> 26:23.060]  pencils,
[26:23.820 --> 26:26.040]  baseball bats, and something else.
[26:26.080 --> 26:27.860]  And you're just moving your mouse, like, across
[26:27.860 --> 26:30.020]  the screen with an... You're controlling an Ian face.
[26:30.300 --> 26:31.820]  And there's a no-scrumping warning
[26:31.820 --> 26:33.820]  that will appear, and apples will, like,
[26:33.860 --> 26:35.820]  fall on the screen, and if you hit an apple, you lose
[26:35.820 --> 26:37.500]  life. Like, you can easily die from the apples.
[26:38.100 --> 26:39.940]  It's a lot of fun. I started it,
[26:40.160 --> 26:41.500]  got number one on the leaderboard,
[26:42.080 --> 26:43.960]  talked shit about it, and just have been
[26:44.460 --> 26:46.100]  demolished. People are way ahead.
[26:46.100 --> 26:47.640]  Geoff just posted his tattoos.
[26:48.120 --> 26:49.760]  Wow. These are amazing.
[26:50.340 --> 26:52.360]  These are, like, so good.
[26:52.760 --> 26:54.220]  I like that Ian's looking
[26:54.220 --> 26:55.540]  at the duck.
[26:56.200 --> 26:57.720]  It's a goose. The goose.
[26:59.220 --> 27:00.260]  And it's close
[27:00.260 --> 27:02.180]  enough that fart hard feels like a thing
[27:02.180 --> 27:04.120]  that Ian could be saying to
[27:04.120 --> 27:06.160]  the goose. Oh, right, like, fart hard
[27:06.160 --> 27:07.540]  is coming out of Ian's mouth. Yeah.
[27:08.940 --> 27:10.100]  Oh, god, they're
[27:10.100 --> 27:12.140]  all really good. They're such good... Well, there you go.
[27:12.300 --> 27:13.960]  Well, I hired, like I said,
[27:13.960 --> 27:16.120]  Derek's one of the best tattooers in America,
[27:16.120 --> 27:16.780]  let alone Austin.
[27:18.260 --> 27:19.400]  So, when you do it, you do it right.
[27:19.900 --> 27:21.420]  Oh, the pencil. That's amazing.
[27:22.020 --> 27:23.880]  That looks fantastic. What a reveal.
[27:24.540 --> 27:25.440]  Speaking of things that
[27:26.180 --> 27:28.000]  reveal... Happy 100, by
[27:28.000 --> 27:29.760]  the way. I've never gotten, in
[27:29.760 --> 27:31.900]  19 years since I started
[27:31.900 --> 27:33.780]  or helped start this company, I've never
[27:33.780 --> 27:35.740]  got a company-related
[27:35.740 --> 27:37.900]  tattoo. These are my first. Wow!
[27:38.300 --> 27:39.220]  That's amazing.
[27:39.920 --> 27:41.340]  I don't know what my nose is on there.
[27:41.340 --> 27:42.900]  Is that just me? Ah,
[27:43.160 --> 27:44.680]  shit, I forgot about your nose. That's true.
[27:44.840 --> 27:47.380]  Yeah, I guess there's that one. That is true.
[27:47.500 --> 27:49.300]  I've only gotten one other company-related tattoo.
[27:53.280 --> 27:54.500]  Andrew, should we get one?
[27:55.540 --> 27:57.260]  I'm not opposed to
[27:57.260 --> 27:59.440]  getting a tattoo. I've just never got one.
[27:59.840 --> 28:01.240]  I've got a good one for you. It's across
[28:01.240 --> 28:02.940]  your ankle and it just says, snap here.
[28:03.340 --> 28:03.620]  Ooh.
[28:04.780 --> 28:07.380]  I don't think that would imply it requires snapping
[28:07.380 --> 28:09.080]  and that it's not already happened.
[28:09.080 --> 28:10.780]  We're already...
[28:10.780 --> 28:11.960]  How are the legs this week?
[28:12.700 --> 28:13.580]  It's okay.
[28:13.960 --> 28:17.140]  I think it would just maybe, like, waste of space
[28:17.140 --> 28:18.860]  would be probably more appropriate.
[28:19.020 --> 28:20.900]  Just useless. Maybe just useless
[28:21.840 --> 28:23.280]  across... different options.
[28:23.480 --> 28:24.280]  We could workshop it.
[28:24.680 --> 28:26.180]  Use and less across the agenda.
[28:28.200 --> 28:29.200]  It just looks like
[28:29.200 --> 28:29.920]  use less.
[28:36.530 --> 28:38.730]  You know what sucks is all of the advantages
[28:38.730 --> 28:40.750]  that big businesses have over the little guy.
[28:40.750 --> 28:42.410]  Like having more access to funding,
[28:42.590 --> 28:44.570]  on top of getting better rates and other privileges
[28:44.570 --> 28:46.250]  reserved for the top dogs.
[28:46.710 --> 28:48.790]  If you run an e-commerce business, you probably feel like
[28:48.790 --> 28:50.670]  it's about time people stop treating e-commerce
[28:50.670 --> 28:52.730]  giants better just because they're
[28:52.730 --> 28:54.370]  bigger. And you're absolutely right.
[28:54.710 --> 28:56.510]  That's why ShipStation gives e-commerce sellers
[28:56.510 --> 28:58.490]  of all sizes access to the same

[30:17.690 --> 30:19.670]  They'll take you back to a time when music was on
[30:19.670 --> 30:21.690]  vinyl, books were bought in a store
[30:21.690 --> 30:24.030]  and hipsters were a style of jeans.
[30:24.470 --> 30:26.090]  And to celebrate the passage of time,
[30:26.330 --> 30:27.890]  they're doing a special collab
[30:27.890 --> 30:29.330]  with George Harrison's estate

[30:54.070 --> 30:55.450]  with a little hemp from a friend.
[30:55.810 --> 30:57.690]  They've partnered with the George Harrison estate
[30:57.690 --> 30:59.830]  to create a new CBD and

[33:03.490 --> 33:04.790]  You ever, um,
[33:05.170 --> 33:07.250]  this is such a weird poll, did you ever watch that
[33:07.250 --> 33:08.590]  Flat Earth documentary
[33:09.170 --> 33:10.950]  that was like popular to you?
[33:10.970 --> 33:12.930]  It was like a really popular Flat Earth
[33:12.930 --> 33:14.870]  documentary and just like it's so ridiculous.
[33:15.010 --> 33:16.950]  It feels like a, like
[33:16.950 --> 33:19.130]  best in show type movie, but it's
[33:19.130 --> 33:21.230]  a documentary and one of the guys
[33:21.230 --> 33:23.130]  in it is like talking about how
[33:23.130 --> 33:25.270]  marketable, um, it is
[33:25.270 --> 33:26.910]  and how it's like their secret underworld
[33:26.910 --> 33:29.110]  and he shows this guy a license plate
[33:29.110 --> 33:31.210]  and he's like, what does this say to you? And the guy
[33:31.210 --> 33:33.170]  says, NASA lies. He's
[33:33.170 --> 33:34.990]  like, yeah, but it could also be nasal
[33:34.990 --> 33:37.210]  eyes, could be ears, throat, nose specialist.
[33:37.390 --> 33:39.090]  You don't know. We're under the record.
[33:39.950 --> 33:40.750]  Read sneaky.
[33:41.150 --> 33:43.050]  That's always what I think about. Just
[33:43.050 --> 33:44.870]  stupid, like misreading a thing. Nobody would
[33:44.870 --> 33:46.730]  read that as nasal eyes.
[33:46.730 --> 33:48.250]  Yeah, it's like that
[33:48.250 --> 33:50.510]  Penn Island website. Was that the
[33:50.510 --> 33:52.710]  documentary where the guy disproved
[33:52.710 --> 33:54.350]  that the earth was flat in the documentary
[33:54.870 --> 33:56.750]  and then decided that his test must have been
[33:56.750 --> 33:58.690]  flawed? I, yes, yes
[33:58.690 --> 34:00.870]  it was. I forgot about that. I watched
[34:00.870 --> 34:02.670]  that movie. Sometimes when I watch movies
[34:02.670 --> 34:04.590]  I'll take like notes if I plan on
[34:04.590 --> 34:06.810]  talking about them in some way. I took
[34:06.810 --> 34:08.850]  like 200 notes in that
[34:08.850 --> 34:10.830]  90 minute movie. It's so absurd
[34:10.830 --> 34:12.790]  and there's so much funny stuff in it.
[34:13.250 --> 34:14.650]  It's a very awkward, like
[34:14.650 --> 34:16.590]  the guy that they're kind of following clearly
[34:16.590 --> 34:18.810]  is in love with this girl that has no interest
[34:18.810 --> 34:19.710]  in him at all.
[34:19.870 --> 34:22.730]  Their interactions are great. I wish
[34:22.730 --> 34:24.670]  I could remember what it's called. It's probably still
[34:24.670 --> 34:26.250]  on Netflix. It's dumb.
[34:26.550 --> 34:28.410]  It's a ridiculously stupid movie
[34:28.410 --> 34:30.530]  that is a lot of fun to watch. Should we get
[34:30.530 --> 34:32.730]  reflective on episode 100? Like what's our favorite
[34:32.730 --> 34:34.290]  moment from F*** Face so far?
[34:34.790 --> 34:36.450]  Wow. Favorite
[34:36.450 --> 34:37.990]  moment? What's the shittiest moment?
[34:38.450 --> 34:40.450]  The shittiest moment? Oh wow.
[34:40.890 --> 34:41.470]  Tater Tots.
[34:41.470 --> 34:43.170]  Yeah, I think post-condiments
[34:43.170 --> 34:45.210]  was our all-time low.
[34:45.490 --> 34:47.350]  Condiments is the all-time low.
[34:47.530 --> 34:48.590]  That's a great call.
[34:49.310 --> 34:51.530]  That was not just like an all-time
[34:51.530 --> 34:52.450]  low for the show.
[34:52.970 --> 34:54.370]  They were editing the condiments.
[34:56.630 --> 34:57.790]  I would say
[34:57.790 --> 34:59.550]  that's the all-time low
[34:59.550 --> 35:00.870]  for our friendship, Geoff.
[35:01.350 --> 35:03.110]  Without a doubt. Like by a lot.
[35:03.350 --> 35:04.590]  Well, so far.
[35:05.070 --> 35:07.390]  So far. I don't know where the
[35:07.390 --> 35:09.430]  baseball thing ranked as far
[35:09.430 --> 35:11.510]  as your personal anger. The baseball thing
[35:11.510 --> 35:12.610]  was one bad day.
[35:13.190 --> 35:15.190]  I was angry
[35:15.190 --> 35:17.230]  about the Tater Tots. That is true.
[35:17.470 --> 35:18.950]  And it felt like a thing that would linger.
[35:19.290 --> 35:21.330]  We just had to move on. I was bummed
[35:21.330 --> 35:22.150]  about the baseball thing.
[35:22.870 --> 35:24.870]  I was angry about the Tots.
[35:26.050 --> 35:27.470]  It was a strange
[35:27.470 --> 35:29.230]  of all things. It was like a religious
[35:29.230 --> 35:31.330]  argument where not only did we view the other
[35:31.330 --> 35:33.290]  side as wrong, we could in no way see
[35:33.290 --> 35:35.310]  how they could view it as right. Like there was
[35:35.310 --> 35:36.710]  no compromise or middle ground.
[35:36.710 --> 35:38.470]  We were so locked in
[35:38.470 --> 35:39.670]  to our definitions.
[35:40.070 --> 35:42.890]  I think my favorite moment so far
[35:42.890 --> 35:44.870]  is very recent.
[35:45.010 --> 35:46.810]  And I think it was Andrew's
[35:46.810 --> 35:48.650]  reaction to looking at the bean hole
[35:48.650 --> 35:50.610]  pictures. I just loved that moment.
[35:52.950 --> 35:54.150]  I couldn't...
[35:54.530 --> 35:56.690]  Oh, it was
[35:56.690 --> 35:58.750]  a problem. It's one of
[35:58.750 --> 36:00.410]  the hardest I've ever laughed.
[36:00.810 --> 36:02.690]  For sure. I think the hardest
[36:02.690 --> 36:04.790]  not to pivot away from reminiscing
[36:04.790 --> 36:06.450]  about the show. I don't think I've told this story
[36:06.450 --> 36:08.850]  on the show once. I laughed so
[36:08.850 --> 36:11.050]  hard one time, I nearly fainted.
[36:11.410 --> 36:12.790]  Like genuinely nearly
[36:12.790 --> 36:14.930]  fainted. I was playing PUBG
[36:15.610 --> 36:16.790]  and I was playing with some
[36:16.790 --> 36:18.870]  friends. And you know
[36:18.870 --> 36:20.790]  like, have you ever seen... I know Geoff will definitely
[36:20.790 --> 36:22.710]  be aware of this play. But are you aware
[36:22.710 --> 36:24.810]  of the Larry Bird steal, Gavin?
[36:24.950 --> 36:26.530]  Where it's like he reads the floor
[36:26.530 --> 36:28.790]  before anything happens. He like sprints to the
[36:28.790 --> 36:30.810]  exact right... Like he just knows what's
[36:30.810 --> 36:32.830]  gonna happen and he reads it and he executes it
[36:32.830 --> 36:34.830]  perfectly. Like he knows
[36:34.830 --> 36:36.790]  the play. It's a fantastic play to watch. It's one of the
[36:36.790 --> 36:38.470]  greatest moments in the history of basketball.
[36:38.770 --> 36:40.130]  But it's like being... Oh, it's basketball?
[36:40.610 --> 36:42.930]  Yeah, it's a basketball thing. But it's like being in the zone
[36:42.930 --> 36:44.670]  it's like he knew what was gonna happen
[36:44.670 --> 36:46.890]  he read it, he fucking predicted it and he executed
[36:46.890 --> 36:48.390]  it. I was playing PUBG
[36:48.910 --> 36:50.470]  and my friend was like
[36:50.470 --> 36:52.710]  in the bottom of this hill and he was
[36:52.710 --> 36:54.570]  getting sniped at from all angles and there's
[36:54.570 --> 36:56.750]  a big tree next to him and he got tagged
[36:56.750 --> 36:58.290]  by a sniper and he's like, I'm down.
[36:58.750 --> 37:00.370]  And so I turn and I see this car
[37:00.370 --> 37:02.470]  and I have my Larry Bird moment
[37:02.470 --> 37:04.590]  of I see like, okay, I'm gonna get in the car
[37:04.590 --> 37:06.190]  I'm gonna drive it to the tree
[37:06.190 --> 37:08.630]  the car will then be like a barricade
[37:08.630 --> 37:10.490]  for us. I'm gonna pick up my friend
[37:10.490 --> 37:12.430]  and we're gonna go and escape. This is
[37:12.430 --> 37:14.090]  fucking... I've got this. So I get in the car
[37:14.090 --> 37:16.490]  I hit drive. I immediately run
[37:16.490 --> 37:18.550]  my friend over and crash into the tree
[37:18.550 --> 37:20.550]  at full speed. I kill him
[37:20.550 --> 37:22.010]  immediately and crash the car
[37:22.010 --> 37:24.390]  and I laughed so hard like all
[37:24.390 --> 37:26.590]  the air shot out of my body and I felt
[37:26.590 --> 37:28.430]  like I was gonna faint. Like I was starting
[37:28.430 --> 37:30.530]  to go down a little bit but I
[37:30.530 --> 37:32.490]  crashed the car and I'm still in
[37:32.490 --> 37:34.650]  a war zone. So like I'm trying to gather
[37:34.650 --> 37:36.370]  myself so I'm not fainting while
[37:36.370 --> 37:38.430]  laughing and I'm just getting sniped at
[37:38.430 --> 37:40.070]  from all sides and I'm like
[37:40.070 --> 37:42.450]  I gotta get out of here. So I hop in the car
[37:42.450 --> 37:44.510]  and I go but I'm like barely
[37:44.510 --> 37:46.390]  like I'm fainting. I'm like
[37:46.390 --> 37:48.230]  in and out of it as I'm driving the car.
[37:48.390 --> 37:50.630]  Could you just not breathe in? I couldn't breathe
[37:50.630 --> 37:52.690]  and I just couldn't stop. I was just laughing
[37:52.690 --> 37:54.570]  so hard that like the lights
[37:54.570 --> 37:56.630]  were going out and I'm just driving
[37:56.630 --> 37:58.450]  away. It was like in a movie where a guy
[37:58.450 --> 38:00.490]  got shot and he gets in the car and like barely
[38:00.490 --> 38:02.270]  escaped. I was almost out of vision.
[38:02.430 --> 38:03.990]  Yeah I was having tunnel vision
[38:03.990 --> 38:06.610]  the whole thing. I can imagine you
[38:06.610 --> 38:08.490]  just sat intensely at your screen
[38:08.490 --> 38:10.730]  like starting to slump over.
[38:11.430 --> 38:12.610]  That's exactly like
[38:12.610 --> 38:14.570]  my head went down. I was
[38:14.570 --> 38:16.550]  like holding myself up on my desk with
[38:16.550 --> 38:18.630]  my arms. If you would ask me going
[38:18.630 --> 38:20.670]  to my friend like the odds of this
[38:20.670 --> 38:22.010]  working the way I wanted it to,
[38:22.210 --> 38:24.490]  a hundred percent. I've never been more
[38:24.490 --> 38:26.390]  confident that anything was going to work
[38:26.390 --> 38:28.210]  in my life and I immediately
[38:28.210 --> 38:30.390]  ran him over and killed him. And then just
[38:30.390 --> 38:32.430]  crashed into the tree because I was laughing
[38:32.430 --> 38:34.410]  so hard as soon as I failed.
[38:34.590 --> 38:36.230]  It was a disaster. You should have saved a clip.
[38:36.770 --> 38:38.670]  I wonder if I have that. I might.
[38:39.030 --> 38:40.450]  I should look. Yeah you should
[38:40.450 --> 38:42.330]  look for that. That is a great...
[38:42.330 --> 38:44.310]  Nick picked the sewing machine
[38:44.310 --> 38:46.390]  argument. The sewing machine argument is a
[38:46.390 --> 38:48.370]  great one because that was at the end
[38:48.370 --> 38:50.490]  of an episode that none of us were all that happy
[38:50.490 --> 38:52.470]  with. We're like that wasn't that great
[38:52.470 --> 38:54.490]  and then we ended and then
[38:54.490 --> 38:56.550]  it was 30 minutes of sewing machine
[38:56.550 --> 38:58.510]  talk that was not at all supposed to be
[38:58.510 --> 39:00.470]  part of the episode. I don't think we were even
[39:00.470 --> 39:02.590]  recording at that point and if it wasn't
[39:02.590 --> 39:04.510]  for Craig, I don't think we would have
[39:04.510 --> 39:05.170]  had that audio.
[39:07.690 --> 39:08.650]  I think...
[39:08.650 --> 39:10.410]  Talking about your... that PUBG
[39:10.410 --> 39:12.530]  incident making you laugh. One
[39:12.530 --> 39:14.650]  of my favorite memories of the podcast
[39:14.650 --> 39:16.450]  has got to be
[39:16.450 --> 39:18.490]  before the podcast. It was when I
[39:18.490 --> 39:19.910]  had the idea for
[39:19.910 --> 39:22.110]  the beef bracelet and then
[39:22.110 --> 39:24.090]  as I was having that idea, I realized I wanted
[39:24.090 --> 39:26.010]  to make a commercial and so I rode my
[39:26.010 --> 39:28.110]  bike down to the park to film
[39:28.110 --> 39:29.190]  it and
[39:29.790 --> 39:31.950]  I was laughing. I was trying not to laugh
[39:31.950 --> 39:34.170]  out loud. But I was laughing internally
[39:34.170 --> 39:35.930]  at all the people that were watching me
[39:35.930 --> 39:37.950]  ride up and down this path over and over
[39:37.950 --> 39:39.110]  again doing multiple takes.
[39:39.770 --> 39:42.050]  Filming with one hand while I was eating beef jerky
[39:42.050 --> 39:43.170]  off my wrist with the other.
[39:43.610 --> 39:45.930]  No hands on the bike and just people looking at me just trying
[39:45.930 --> 39:47.650]  to have their lunch before they go back to work.
[39:47.650 --> 39:49.510]  I was just going back and forth. I probably did
[39:49.510 --> 39:51.470]  eight times. Just
[39:51.470 --> 39:52.470]  looking like a lunatic.
[39:53.210 --> 39:55.590]  I didn't know that. That's really funny. I didn't
[39:55.590 --> 39:56.890]  realize it took you so many takes.
[39:57.390 --> 39:59.310]  You gotta get it just right, man. It's a commercial.
[39:59.690 --> 40:01.490]  Yeah, super important too. It's the
[40:01.490 --> 40:02.510]  debut of Uniform.
[40:03.130 --> 40:05.510]  Show it off in the best light. What about you, Eric? Have you
[40:05.510 --> 40:06.750]  ever had a good time making this?
[40:08.450 --> 40:08.850]  I
[40:09.710 --> 40:11.750]  love the middle of every episode
[40:12.390 --> 40:14.030]  and then despise
[40:14.030 --> 40:15.610]  the end of every episode.
[40:15.610 --> 40:17.710]  I think that's typically how this goes
[40:17.710 --> 40:19.690]  where it's like, look, I told you guys
[40:19.690 --> 40:21.630]  beforehand. This is episode 100. We're only
[40:21.630 --> 40:23.610]  recording one, so I don't want you to feel like we have
[40:23.610 --> 40:25.810]  to be constrained to an hour, so that's fine. Typically,
[40:26.270 --> 40:27.650]  we do have to be constrained for an
[40:27.650 --> 40:29.690]  hour because these are hour-long shows and we
[40:29.690 --> 40:31.790]  sometimes do two or other things are going on.
[40:32.270 --> 40:33.690]  So the middle of
[40:33.690 --> 40:35.610]  every episode, I really, really,
[40:35.710 --> 40:37.570]  really love. But the end is just
[40:37.570 --> 40:39.410]  so difficult
[40:39.410 --> 40:41.970]  when it doesn't need to be. I think the worst
[40:43.190 --> 40:43.990]  is when
[40:44.730 --> 40:46.110]  Geoff is like wrapping
[40:46.110 --> 40:47.950]  it up because he knows it's time to go and then
[40:47.950 --> 40:49.910]  Andrew just sort of like side
[40:49.910 --> 40:52.050]  swipes with like the
[40:52.050 --> 40:54.030]  most inane shit and it's like, just
[40:54.030 --> 40:55.910]  save it. What are you doing? I remember one where
[40:55.910 --> 40:57.990]  Andrew just sat in the middle of the outro
[40:57.990 --> 40:59.910]  and was like, you ever watch shit on
[40:59.910 --> 41:00.270]  Quibi?
[41:10.850 --> 41:12.010]  Oh, by the way,
[41:12.010 --> 41:13.910]  I'm back, guys. Derek's
[41:13.910 --> 41:15.590]  gone. I'm sitting on my desk like normal.
[41:16.210 --> 41:17.730]  So the Tattoo Sog is over.
[41:17.950 --> 41:20.050]  You have my full attention now. I apologize for being
[41:20.050 --> 41:21.710]  half in, half out for the first half.
[41:21.710 --> 41:24.070]  That was a great bit.
[41:24.770 --> 41:25.730]  I'm blown away.
[41:26.230 --> 41:27.250]  I really didn't expect that.
[41:27.730 --> 41:29.690]  I really just wanted to...
[41:29.690 --> 41:31.370]  In all seriousness,
[41:32.510 --> 41:33.670]  all kidding aside,
[41:34.690 --> 41:35.970]  I was talking about this with my
[41:35.970 --> 41:37.590]  therapist yesterday. I don't know how this happened,
[41:37.910 --> 41:39.450]  but this podcast has become,
[41:39.450 --> 41:41.410]  outside of my family, the most important
[41:41.410 --> 41:43.510]  thing in my life. And the last hundred
[41:43.510 --> 41:45.030]  episodes have
[41:45.970 --> 41:47.390]  helped me immeasurably
[41:47.390 --> 41:48.690]  in terms of
[41:49.270 --> 41:51.310]  getting through the pandemic and also
[41:51.310 --> 41:53.230]  in terms of my own mental health outside
[41:53.830 --> 41:54.970]  of the pandemic.
[41:55.630 --> 41:57.390]  And putting
[41:57.390 --> 41:59.530]  it on my body, it seems like the easiest
[41:59.530 --> 42:01.310]  decision in the world to make because it's just
[42:02.350 --> 42:03.550]  been... And also,
[42:03.970 --> 42:05.290]  I think it's...
[42:05.290 --> 42:07.630]  to be, I guess,
[42:07.630 --> 42:09.590]  a little more
[42:09.590 --> 42:11.690]  personal. I think it's maybe the best thing
[42:11.690 --> 42:13.550]  I've ever been a part of making. And
[42:13.550 --> 42:15.930]  it's really nice to feel at almost 47
[42:15.930 --> 42:17.670]  like I haven't plateaued
[42:17.670 --> 42:19.410]  and that we're still capable... I'm still capable
[42:19.410 --> 42:21.790]  of contributing in a way
[42:21.790 --> 42:23.850]  that gets
[42:23.850 --> 42:25.330]  progressively better as time goes on.
[42:25.470 --> 42:27.430]  You don't want to feel like... You don't want to
[42:27.430 --> 42:29.630]  realize you're on the back nine and you're
[42:30.850 --> 42:31.290]  retreating.
[42:31.830 --> 42:33.350]  And I don't feel like that
[42:33.350 --> 42:35.430]  every time I'm on this podcast, which is really nice.
[42:35.430 --> 42:37.310]  I've been blown away recently at how
[42:37.310 --> 42:39.370]  pretty much my favorite thing of every week
[42:39.370 --> 42:41.190]  came out of the middle of the pandemic.
[42:42.170 --> 42:43.570]  To the point where I'm like, wow.
[42:44.170 --> 42:44.390]  I'm
[42:45.770 --> 42:47.530]  not glad it happened, but just like,
[42:47.590 --> 42:49.530]  wow, I don't think we would have made this necessarily if it wasn't
[42:49.530 --> 42:50.910]  for the pandemic. I know.
[42:51.290 --> 42:53.490]  It's this weird kind of conflict
[42:53.490 --> 42:55.430]  of probably...
[42:56.050 --> 42:57.650]  Well, not probably. I would definitively
[42:57.650 --> 42:59.530]  say the most fun I've had working
[42:59.530 --> 43:01.610]  on anything and just getting to be part
[43:01.610 --> 43:03.510]  of something that I think is so special
[43:03.510 --> 43:05.710]  and fun being
[43:05.710 --> 43:07.450]  created due to a
[43:07.450 --> 43:09.610]  horrible event that
[43:09.610 --> 43:11.010]  impacted the entire world.
[43:11.070 --> 43:12.450]  It impacted all of us personally.
[43:13.670 --> 43:15.550]  I can't imagine what it would
[43:15.550 --> 43:17.550]  have been like going through those times without
[43:17.550 --> 43:19.690]  this show. Just being able to
[43:20.230 --> 43:21.330]  have a time
[43:21.330 --> 43:23.670]  every week, especially when things were...
[43:23.670 --> 43:25.330]  Now we're kind of in a place right now where
[43:25.330 --> 43:27.390]  we're kind of getting back in the swing of things and
[43:27.390 --> 43:29.570]  the schedule isn't always consistent, but when we were
[43:29.570 --> 43:31.250]  in the heart of the pandemic,
[43:31.690 --> 43:33.370]  knowing that every week I was going
[43:33.370 --> 43:35.490]  to get to have one hour to play with my friends
[43:35.910 --> 43:37.010]  was so special.
[43:37.210 --> 43:39.370]  And it's been so wonderful to have
[43:39.370 --> 43:41.330]  that time. And also just like the
[43:41.330 --> 43:42.450]  audience has talked about.
[43:43.650 --> 43:45.410]  I interact with the audience quite a bit
[43:45.410 --> 43:46.890]  and I hear a lot of how meaningful
[43:46.890 --> 43:49.050]  it has been to have this space as listeners
[43:49.050 --> 43:51.090]  for them. And it's just
[43:51.090 --> 43:53.230]  I think been equally important for us
[43:53.230 --> 43:55.530]  to have this space. So as much as they thank us
[43:56.610 --> 43:57.410]  for creating
[43:57.410 --> 43:58.910]  the show and doing what we do,
[43:58.910 --> 44:00.910]  we owe so much to them as well
[44:00.910 --> 44:02.910]  for supporting our show and allowing us to
[44:02.910 --> 44:04.770]  go these hundred episodes and
[44:04.770 --> 44:06.250]  have this space for ourselves.
[44:06.510 --> 44:08.910]  I literally had that conversation with someone
[44:08.910 --> 44:10.950]  recently where they were like, yeah, you know, really helped me through the
[44:10.950 --> 44:12.970]  pandemic. And my response was like,
[44:13.250 --> 44:14.690]  dude, me too.
[44:14.890 --> 44:16.330]  Thanks so much for watching it.
[44:17.630 --> 44:18.590]  I equally
[44:18.590 --> 44:19.230]  need it.
[44:20.750 --> 44:22.850]  We certainly didn't talk about it
[44:22.850 --> 44:24.830]  in this content, but I
[44:24.830 --> 44:27.170]  did go through an entire nervous breakdown
[44:27.170 --> 44:29.090]  during year one of
[44:29.090 --> 44:29.950]  The F*** Face Podcast.
[44:30.570 --> 44:33.130]  Had to take a step away
[44:33.130 --> 44:34.610]  from my job and
[44:34.990 --> 44:36.510]  go through some intensive therapy.
[44:36.970 --> 44:38.530]  And this
[44:39.550 --> 44:41.010]  podcast was such an
[44:41.010 --> 44:42.770]  anchor in my life
[44:42.770 --> 44:44.850]  of positivity that I was able
[44:44.850 --> 44:46.770]  to forget about all of that for an hour
[44:46.770 --> 44:48.030]  and five minutes or so
[44:48.750 --> 44:50.690]  a week. Which is honestly also
[44:50.690 --> 44:52.910]  why when Andrew swipes in
[44:52.910 --> 44:54.690]  with a quitty comment or whatever and I
[44:54.690 --> 44:56.650]  see an opportunity to extend the podcast another
[44:56.650 --> 44:58.150]  10 minutes, it's just like
[44:58.690 --> 45:00.910]  another 10 minutes of Shangri-La
[45:00.910 --> 45:02.750]  before you have to... Eric, come on!
[45:03.190 --> 45:04.530]  Before we have to go back to the real world.
[45:04.770 --> 45:05.470]  It's kind of true.
[45:06.330 --> 45:08.610]  So really, it's like when Eric wants us to
[45:08.610 --> 45:09.410]  stop recording,
[45:10.250 --> 45:12.130]  he wants to take that away from us.
[45:12.850 --> 45:14.370]  Yeah, it's been
[45:15.810 --> 45:16.810]  a wild
[45:16.810 --> 45:18.310]  journey. And the fact that
[45:18.310 --> 45:20.510]  how it came together too
[45:20.510 --> 45:22.770]  and the fact that this show has
[45:22.770 --> 45:24.790]  worked as well as it has in itself
[45:24.790 --> 45:26.830]  is absurd. We've never had
[45:26.830 --> 45:28.890]  a production meeting regarding this show.
[45:28.990 --> 45:30.750]  Everything about the creation
[45:30.750 --> 45:32.930]  and the process of making it
[45:32.930 --> 45:33.890]  is so absurd.
[45:34.750 --> 45:36.650]  But I'm just so incredibly
[45:36.650 --> 45:39.250]  thankful for you guys
[45:39.250 --> 45:40.070]  and Nick and Eric.
[45:40.190 --> 45:42.750]  I knew obviously Geoff and Gavin before this. I didn't know
[45:42.750 --> 45:44.890]  Eric or Nick. And it's just been so much
[45:44.890 --> 45:45.910]  fun meeting them
[45:46.830 --> 45:48.290]  and getting to... I don't know.
[45:48.590 --> 45:50.870]  It's been nice. This whole experience has been
[45:50.870 --> 45:51.230]  wonderful.
[45:52.390 --> 45:54.450]  Not to get too
[45:54.450 --> 45:56.810]  emotional on a podcast named F*** Face.
[45:59.050 --> 45:59.910]  It's really
[45:59.910 --> 46:00.550]  meant a lot.
[46:01.010 --> 46:02.890]  Thank you to everybody that has
[46:02.890 --> 46:05.310]  supported us in these 100 episodes.
[46:05.710 --> 46:06.330]  100 more?
[46:07.370 --> 46:08.570]  At least.
[46:11.110 --> 46:12.750]  I'm sitting here trying to figure out what to do
[46:12.750 --> 46:13.630]  for episode 1000.
[46:15.410 --> 46:17.030]  I've already done the tattoo thing.
[46:17.030 --> 46:18.210]  What year will that be?
[46:19.650 --> 46:20.970]  Eric, what year will that be?
[46:21.390 --> 46:22.730]  I think the thing that
[46:22.730 --> 46:25.010]  people don't realize is that this is the
[46:25.010 --> 46:27.030]  most creative, creative outlet I've
[46:27.030 --> 46:27.870]  ever experienced.
[46:29.530 --> 46:30.870]  We've been doing this for 19...
[46:30.870 --> 46:32.910]  I've been doing this for 19 years in other
[46:32.910 --> 46:35.270]  productions. This is certainly not the first or even the 50th
[46:35.270 --> 46:36.130]  production I've started.
[46:37.370 --> 46:38.910]  There's been nothing like it.
[46:39.110 --> 46:40.990]  It is unique in
[46:40.990 --> 46:42.890]  every way. And as I think
[46:42.890 --> 46:44.430]  Eric or Nick pointed out earlier,
[46:44.430 --> 46:46.470]  we started this
[46:46.470 --> 46:47.570]  because of the pandemic.
[46:48.550 --> 46:49.930]  And in that process,
[46:50.030 --> 46:52.290]  we had to move the entire company,
[46:52.430 --> 46:53.170]  the day job company,
[46:54.150 --> 46:56.570]  to an online work-from-home company.
[46:56.970 --> 46:58.030]  And so all of our productions
[46:58.030 --> 46:59.850]  ended up being work-from-home productions.
[47:00.090 --> 47:02.270]  And since the podcast, every one of them
[47:02.270 --> 47:03.810]  has gone back in person except for this one.
[47:03.950 --> 47:06.110]  This is the only production that we do
[47:06.110 --> 47:07.670]  that's all remote to this day.
[47:08.070 --> 47:10.370]  But at some point, one day, maybe in Vegas,
[47:10.710 --> 47:11.310]  it could happen.
[47:12.250 --> 47:13.810]  No, yeah, it's going to.
[47:14.010 --> 47:15.350]  No, yeah, we've committed.
[47:16.530 --> 47:17.490]  Not in May.
[47:17.650 --> 47:19.350]  In November. We've committed.
[47:19.550 --> 47:20.190]  We're doing it.
[47:20.850 --> 47:22.630]  We've committed. We've all said yes.
[47:23.310 --> 47:24.290]  Andrew said yes?
[47:24.630 --> 47:25.690]  Yeah, he did.
[47:26.130 --> 47:29.610]  I don't like the way that you said
[47:29.610 --> 47:30.550]  yes and then well.
[47:31.530 --> 47:32.450]  We've all committed.
[47:33.430 --> 47:33.710]  Yeah.
[47:34.770 --> 47:36.670]  I don't like the way you said yeah.
[47:37.150 --> 47:39.770]  Even the yeah has half a question mark
[47:39.770 --> 47:40.310]  on the end of it.
[47:40.370 --> 47:42.670]  Let me clarify this because I 100% committed.
[47:43.050 --> 47:45.430]  I didn't commit to a specific date, but I said I would do it
[47:45.430 --> 47:46.350]  and we agreed in October.
[47:47.070 --> 47:48.550]  I think that we've...
[47:48.550 --> 47:51.470]  I think we've looked at October and it might be
[47:51.470 --> 47:52.150]  early November.
[47:52.610 --> 47:55.150]  That's fine. You heard him say it.
[47:55.310 --> 47:56.710]  Everyone heard him say that's fine.
[47:57.030 --> 47:58.670]  I'm excited. I've never been to Vegas.
[47:59.130 --> 47:59.970]  It's going to be a great time.
[48:00.470 --> 48:02.090]  And I've never been to Vancouver Island.
[48:03.310 --> 48:05.070]  Listen, we've got bagels.
[48:05.330 --> 48:06.350]  We've got crabs.
[48:07.030 --> 48:08.390]  We've got everything you need.
[48:08.970 --> 48:10.810]  When can we go to Vancouver Island?
[48:11.410 --> 48:12.190]  That's a great question.
[48:12.450 --> 48:13.650]  When do you want...
[48:14.170 --> 48:15.390]  You're going to say as soon as possible.
[48:15.550 --> 48:16.170]  No, I mean...
[48:18.170 --> 48:19.370]  Not in May.
[48:20.190 --> 48:21.070]  Not in May.
[48:22.330 --> 48:23.990]  What's the best time of the year
[48:23.990 --> 48:25.850]  for Nanaimo?
[48:26.330 --> 48:27.890]  You probably want to go in the summer.
[48:29.190 --> 48:30.170]  Before November?
[48:31.850 --> 48:32.370]  Before...
[48:32.370 --> 48:32.850]  Yeah.
[48:32.850 --> 48:35.210]  Either this coming into the summer
[48:35.210 --> 48:35.950]  or the next year.
[48:36.370 --> 48:38.950]  You're giving us permission to come visit in the next
[48:38.950 --> 48:40.470]  two to three months?
[48:40.810 --> 48:42.670]  You can visit whenever you want. I don't care.
[48:43.310 --> 48:44.830]  You're welcome to come here whenever.
[48:45.310 --> 48:47.410]  You can visit whenever you want.
[48:47.590 --> 48:48.470]  I don't care.
[48:48.730 --> 48:51.050]  Are we going to see you while we're there?
[48:52.890 --> 48:53.710]  Of course.
[48:54.030 --> 48:56.330]  The way Gavin said that was like
[48:56.330 --> 48:58.330]  I'm gatekeeping the island in some way
[48:58.330 --> 48:59.970]  or that I don't want you guys here.
[48:59.970 --> 49:01.350]  I'd love for you guys to be here.
[49:01.390 --> 49:04.130]  By the way, Gavin and I just went to
[49:04.130 --> 49:06.390]  Seattle for like two days.
[49:06.790 --> 49:07.770]  We were like
[49:07.770 --> 49:09.790]  45 miles away from you.
[49:09.790 --> 49:10.630]  That's a great point.
[49:11.350 --> 49:13.730]  You could literally take a ferry from
[49:13.730 --> 49:15.090]  Seattle to the island.
[49:15.690 --> 49:16.810]  Yeah, you could take a ferry.
[49:17.390 --> 49:18.130]  I don't want to travel.
[49:18.530 --> 49:21.510]  We were 99% of the way there. We needed you to go
[49:21.510 --> 49:23.010]  1% of the way.
[49:23.110 --> 49:23.670]  I'm not traveling.
[49:23.690 --> 49:25.130]  And you had no interest.
[49:25.130 --> 49:27.070]  I'm not going to a different country.
[49:29.390 --> 49:31.450]  If you were in Vancouver, I'd gladly go.
[49:31.530 --> 49:32.590]  I'd take a boat
[49:34.050 --> 49:34.730]  within Canada.
[49:34.750 --> 49:36.730]  Here's what I think is really happening.
[49:37.470 --> 49:39.690]  While Andrew was peeping at the pissing woman,
[49:40.210 --> 49:41.230]  the police came in.
[49:41.350 --> 49:42.570]  They were trying to figure out what's going on.
[49:43.070 --> 49:45.250]  They confiscated his passport for two years.
[49:45.410 --> 49:46.970]  And I think he's waiting to get it back.
[49:47.190 --> 49:48.470]  I think something like that has happened.
[49:48.850 --> 49:51.190]  I think he is literally unable to travel.
[49:51.670 --> 49:53.510]  I actually was looking at my ID recently
[49:54.210 --> 49:54.690]  and I realized
[49:55.430 --> 49:57.330]  that I have long hair in my ID photo.
[49:57.470 --> 50:00.070]  So there's one photo that exists of me with long hair.
[50:00.250 --> 50:01.770]  It exists. It's just on my ID.
[50:02.650 --> 50:03.410]  Oh, God.
[50:03.890 --> 50:05.050]  But yeah, I could travel.
[50:05.270 --> 50:07.830]  I'm excited. Whenever you guys eventually come here...
[50:07.830 --> 50:09.630]  You could travel, but not till November.
[50:10.150 --> 50:11.730]  No, well, and leaving the country
[50:11.730 --> 50:12.710]  is a different matter.
[50:13.070 --> 50:15.510]  If it was a Canadian thing, I'd be gladly...
[50:16.090 --> 50:17.290]  What is this heck file?
[50:17.470 --> 50:18.970]  What did you just send, Gavin?
[50:19.470 --> 50:21.250]  I'm trying to see. I've just realized these are like
[50:21.250 --> 50:23.470]  high-efficiency photos.
[50:23.630 --> 50:25.990]  I'm not sure I can even do my slideshow.
[50:26.190 --> 50:27.290]  Wait, wait. So you're saying
[50:27.290 --> 50:29.150]  that the thing that you've teased for weeks
[50:29.590 --> 50:31.630]  is tied to a thing you cannot...
[50:31.630 --> 50:32.050]  we cannot see.
[50:32.050 --> 50:35.190]  Why aren't these JPEGs? Oh, man.
[50:35.870 --> 50:36.610]  Oh, boy.
[50:36.770 --> 50:37.710]  Do you want me to click this?
[50:37.850 --> 50:40.370]  I clicked it. It didn't do a fucking thing.
[50:41.330 --> 50:43.070]  File I can't open in my inbox.
[50:43.390 --> 50:44.830]  Do you have my banking information now?
[50:45.950 --> 50:47.250]  Down in this file...
[50:48.130 --> 50:50.410]  Let me see if I can save a freaking...
[50:50.950 --> 50:52.290]  Oh, I got it to work.
[50:52.470 --> 50:53.630]  I got it to work. Okay.
[50:53.910 --> 50:55.050]  It's a picture of your phone.
[50:55.850 --> 50:55.970]  Nope.
[50:57.250 --> 51:00.010]  Yeah, it's a picture of your phone. Meg is in the middle.
[51:01.770 --> 51:02.490]  It's about...
[51:02.490 --> 51:03.950]  It's about 8... or your watch. Whatever.
[51:04.490 --> 51:04.850]  849.
[51:06.390 --> 51:07.770]  But it says 1430.
[51:08.290 --> 51:09.130]  So you can see them?
[51:09.570 --> 51:10.730]  I see that one image.
[51:11.470 --> 51:13.790]  But I had to download it and then look at it through preview on my Mac.
[51:14.190 --> 51:14.790]  Oh, boy.
[51:15.410 --> 51:16.910]  But I'll do it that way. I don't care.
[51:16.910 --> 51:18.050]  Am I frozen?
[51:18.930 --> 51:19.050]  No.
[51:19.650 --> 51:21.050]  Okay. My screen froze.
[51:21.350 --> 51:24.430]  I am trying to view this file on a PC
[51:24.430 --> 51:26.830]  and it takes me to the Microsoft store
[51:26.830 --> 51:28.950]  and it wants me to pay one dollar
[51:28.950 --> 51:31.570]  to download the thing so I can view the extension
[51:31.570 --> 51:34.130]  and I will outright refuse.
[51:34.710 --> 51:35.410]  It's not...
[51:35.410 --> 51:36.490]  I gotta be honest with you.
[51:36.570 --> 51:38.590]  This picture of Gavin's hairy arm is not worth a dollar.
[51:39.390 --> 51:39.610]  No.
[51:40.670 --> 51:41.650]  Oh, well, damn.
[51:42.070 --> 51:44.410]  So I see a watch. Tech rehearsal.
[51:45.570 --> 51:45.890]  1430.
[51:46.350 --> 51:48.830]  Okay, you'll have to translate the pictures for the other stuff.
[51:49.050 --> 51:49.330]  Okay.
[51:49.890 --> 51:51.730]  It's 36 degrees, 59% on your battery.
[51:52.250 --> 51:53.870]  You want me to tell my shitty story?
[51:54.310 --> 51:54.670]  I don't know.
[51:55.470 --> 51:57.390]  I didn't mean to hype this up.
[51:57.490 --> 51:58.950]  I was debating whether to tell this.
[51:58.990 --> 52:00.090]  I've never told anyone this story.
[52:00.290 --> 52:01.730]  I didn't even tell Meg until last week.
[52:01.790 --> 52:03.310]  And she was like, how have you never told me this story?
[52:04.450 --> 52:07.590]  And I'll be honest, I've just been mildly traumatized by it.
[52:07.630 --> 52:08.750]  I wasn't sure if it was funny.
[52:08.930 --> 52:10.050]  It might not be funny, alright?
[52:10.670 --> 52:11.650]  This might be loud.
[52:14.190 --> 52:15.610]  What is wrong with you?
[52:15.710 --> 52:17.070]  It can't be worse than lactating women.
[52:17.210 --> 52:18.250]  You got this. It's fine.
[52:18.330 --> 52:19.710]  I set the bar real low last week.
[52:20.090 --> 52:21.890]  Okay, so we're in Melbourne, right?
[52:22.350 --> 52:23.710]  We're doing the Age Live Tour.
[52:23.850 --> 52:24.410]  Geoff, you were there.
[52:25.390 --> 52:29.390]  We got to Melbourne, I think it was the day of the tour.
[52:30.190 --> 52:31.130]  What year is the actual date?
[52:31.890 --> 52:32.290]  2019.
[52:33.190 --> 52:33.870]  Okay, 2019.
[52:34.850 --> 52:35.650]  January 2019.
[52:36.090 --> 52:37.030]  So it's winter for us.
[52:37.030 --> 52:39.150]  But we were in Australia, so it was hot as balls.
[52:39.290 --> 52:41.130]  As you can see by my watch there,
[52:42.270 --> 52:43.250]  36 degrees Celsius.
[52:43.390 --> 52:44.390]  It's going to be about 42.
[52:44.450 --> 52:47.030]  I think it ended up being like 43, 44 degrees Celsius.
[52:47.210 --> 52:50.530]  Which is like, I don't know, 112 or something?
[52:50.710 --> 52:51.290]  I don't know, Fahrenheit?
[52:51.470 --> 52:52.010]  It was hot as hell.
[52:52.550 --> 52:53.590]  It definitely was, I remember.
[52:54.370 --> 52:57.410]  And also on my watch you can see I've got tech rehearsal at 2.30.
[52:57.550 --> 52:58.630]  That's all I've got to do that day.
[52:58.990 --> 53:01.050]  Woke up early, went for a stroll.
[53:01.210 --> 53:03.910]  We were in an area of Melbourne, I think called St. Kilda.
[53:04.610 --> 53:05.550]  If I remember correctly.
[53:06.710 --> 53:07.790]  Went for a little walk.
[53:07.870 --> 53:09.250]  There's a little park nearby the hotel.
[53:09.370 --> 53:10.290]  Just sort of strolling around.
[53:10.510 --> 53:11.970]  I found a pier.
[53:12.710 --> 53:15.090]  So I thought, ah, you know, walk down this pier.
[53:15.370 --> 53:17.010]  Look out into the ocean.
[53:17.990 --> 53:21.850]  And I saw that the water was amazingly still.
[53:22.410 --> 53:23.890]  And I was like, this can't,
[53:24.250 --> 53:25.810]  this surely can't be the ocean then.
[53:26.290 --> 53:27.530]  And then I looked on the maps,
[53:27.730 --> 53:29.730]  and I realized it's not the ocean.
[53:29.850 --> 53:31.590]  It's just like a big, what do you call that?
[53:31.650 --> 53:34.110]  Like an inlet, like a big bay by Melbourne.
[53:34.110 --> 53:35.810]  So it's like perfectly still water.
[53:36.010 --> 53:39.050]  And I thought, I've never seen a body of water this big.
[53:39.450 --> 53:40.730]  That looked so still.
[53:41.310 --> 53:42.170]  So then, I thought,
[53:42.450 --> 53:44.050]  I'll take, ah, my thing's too powerful.
[53:44.230 --> 53:45.410]  Hold on, are we going to move to Slack?
[53:45.990 --> 53:47.190]  Might have to move to Slack here.
[53:47.410 --> 53:50.470]  I love watching you struggle with tech stuff.
[53:51.490 --> 53:52.970]  It might be my favorite.
[53:54.030 --> 53:55.070]  Because you're such a little,
[53:55.210 --> 53:57.170]  such a mincy little prick about it usually.
[53:57.570 --> 53:58.910]  When everybody else's stuff goes wrong.
[53:59.350 --> 54:01.890]  Oh, it's 136 megs.
[54:02.210 --> 54:04.450]  Thank you, fell in love with just one.
[54:04.690 --> 54:05.250]  Hey!
[54:05.770 --> 54:07.890]  Okay, I'm sending a video
[54:07.890 --> 54:09.530]  of me filming
[54:09.990 --> 54:11.070]  the very still water.
[54:11.950 --> 54:13.910]  As I was filming it,
[54:14.270 --> 54:15.450]  the wind picked up.
[54:16.250 --> 54:17.410]  Oh, Jack's here.
[54:18.450 --> 54:19.790]  Is he listed?
[54:20.430 --> 54:21.930]  What is happening? Tell your story!
[54:22.270 --> 54:23.190]  What is going on?
[54:23.470 --> 54:24.530]  Where do I see this video?
[54:25.270 --> 54:25.990]  It's in Slack.
[54:27.970 --> 54:28.670]  Oh, Jesus.
[54:29.150 --> 54:30.090]  Now, as you can see,
[54:30.270 --> 54:32.630]  the second I started filming the stillness
[54:32.630 --> 54:34.570]  of the water, the wind picked up
[54:34.570 --> 54:36.470]  and, uh, sort of destroyed the illusion
[54:36.470 --> 54:38.770]  of the still water. So now there's wind blowing everywhere.
[54:38.910 --> 54:40.650]  I'm like, oh man, think of the, what's with the
[54:40.650 --> 54:42.550]  timing of that? Here's my next video.
[54:43.050 --> 54:44.730]  Is this, is this the end of the
[54:44.730 --> 54:46.450]  story? That they got windy? Nope.
[54:46.450 --> 54:48.570]  Okay. Uh, so now, I'm like
[54:48.570 --> 54:50.170]  blown away by how sudden...
[54:50.830 --> 54:52.050]  Eric said this is insane.
[54:52.330 --> 54:54.490]  I'm blown away at how suddenly windy
[54:54.490 --> 54:56.530]  this is. Immediately, like, my
[54:56.530 --> 54:58.510]  AirPod blew out of my ear. I'm chasing it
[54:58.510 --> 55:00.530]  down the pier. I did this little video of my
[55:00.530 --> 55:01.230]  own face.
[55:03.830 --> 55:04.230]  Okay.
[55:05.890 --> 55:06.530]  None of the
[55:06.530 --> 55:08.570]  videos will play for me. It's just the
[55:08.570 --> 55:10.570]  still of the beginning and the audio.
[55:10.570 --> 55:12.250]  You got it. It's just Gavin.
[55:12.470 --> 55:13.110]  It's just Gavin.
[55:14.390 --> 55:15.190]  You're missing
[55:17.050 --> 55:18.530]  nothing. I'm, I'm
[55:18.530 --> 55:20.530]  dead serious when I'm saying that
[55:20.530 --> 55:22.450]  what you're seeing in the first frame
[55:22.450 --> 55:24.190]  is just what the videos are.
[55:24.190 --> 55:26.150]  Gavin is making a case
[55:26.150 --> 55:28.170]  for the elimination of all visual
[55:28.170 --> 55:29.130]  aids going forward.
[55:30.670 --> 55:32.230]  I'm setting the goddamn scene
[55:32.230 --> 55:34.270]  right. Alright. So it's too
[55:34.270 --> 55:35.990]  windy now. The water's ruined.
[55:36.150 --> 55:38.070]  It's not still anymore. My AirPods are blowing
[55:38.070 --> 55:39.830]  out of my face. I'm just like, oh god.
[55:39.950 --> 55:42.050]  It's hot. It's like hot wind. It's
[55:42.050 --> 55:43.870]  not nice. I'm, I'm thinking
[55:43.870 --> 55:45.830]  I'm gonna leave the pier now.
[55:46.030 --> 55:48.170]  So I'm right at the end of the pier. I'm starting to walk all the
[55:48.170 --> 55:50.090]  way back. And the wind
[55:50.090 --> 55:52.030]  is just fiercely blowing against
[55:52.030 --> 55:54.090]  me to the point where it's like I'm walking against a
[55:54.090 --> 55:55.970]  wall. And, uh, the
[55:55.970 --> 55:57.410]  St. Kilda Pier
[55:58.530 --> 55:59.250]  has this
[56:00.750 --> 56:02.090]  interesting, like, curb
[56:02.090 --> 56:03.330]  thing going up it.
[56:03.710 --> 56:05.070]  Right? You see that on the picture? Yeah.
[56:05.870 --> 56:07.890]  I'm not sure if it's like some sort of water break or
[56:07.890 --> 56:09.930]  I don't know what it's for. Okay. In the map
[56:09.930 --> 56:11.330]  picture, we're going back there. Okay.
[56:11.990 --> 56:13.930]  Oh, sorry. I'll put it in the discord. Put it in the discord.
[56:14.050 --> 56:14.790]  There we go. Blam.
[56:15.810 --> 56:16.170]  Nope.
[56:17.710 --> 56:19.430]  I gotta go back to the sla- okay.
[56:19.430 --> 56:21.650]  Yes, I see the pier. Okay. Yeah, you have to
[56:21.650 --> 56:22.130]  alt-tab.
[56:23.890 --> 56:25.330]  I feel like I'm part of a
[56:25.330 --> 56:26.450]  choose-your-own-adventure.
[56:28.290 --> 56:29.490]  So I'm just, uh,
[56:29.710 --> 56:31.450]  you know, like a child. So I'm walking back up
[56:31.450 --> 56:33.310]  the pier and I'm, like, jumping up on the curb and, like,
[56:33.330 --> 56:35.390]  hopping back down. But sometimes
[56:35.390 --> 56:37.450]  the wind is so strong I can't, like,
[56:37.570 --> 56:39.510]  step up onto the curb. So I'm, like,
[56:39.590 --> 56:41.250]  stepping against the wind. I'm getting-
[56:41.250 --> 56:43.510]  I'm trying to step up one step and I'm getting blown back
[56:43.510 --> 56:45.470]  like five steps. Uh, I've
[56:45.470 --> 56:47.170]  never really felt wind like it all of a sudden.
[56:47.170 --> 56:49.310]  There was one other person on the pier.
[56:49.470 --> 56:51.250]  It was this sort of, probably, like, 50
[56:51.250 --> 56:52.790]  year old dude walking
[56:52.790 --> 56:54.650]  the other way. Walking opposite.
[56:55.390 --> 56:56.570]  And I could see him coming in the distance.
[56:57.110 --> 56:59.230]  And, uh, I'm trying to step back
[56:59.230 --> 57:01.230]  up on this curb. I get blown backwards.
[57:01.570 --> 57:03.110]  But the wind is
[57:03.110 --> 57:04.970]  hitting him in the back. And suddenly
[57:04.970 --> 57:07.330]  this massive gust slams
[57:07.330 --> 57:08.910]  me backwards like ten steps.
[57:09.390 --> 57:11.270]  And it honestly looked like
[57:11.270 --> 57:13.170]  it lifted him up in the air. It was like when
[57:13.170 --> 57:15.130]  Wee Man opened the parachute in front of that
[57:15.130 --> 57:16.810]  fan, he went
[57:16.810 --> 57:19.210]  flying! He went sailing
[57:19.210 --> 57:21.190]  towards me as I'm going sailing back.
[57:21.890 --> 57:22.270]  And, uh,
[57:23.070 --> 57:25.130]  completely ate shit over this weird
[57:25.130 --> 57:27.330]  curb. To the point where he ended up
[57:27.330 --> 57:29.090]  slumped over it. Like, his legs were
[57:29.090 --> 57:31.130]  on the wide side and his head was on, like, the narrow
[57:31.130 --> 57:32.790]  side. And, uh,
[57:33.110 --> 57:35.030]  I was like, oh, Jesus! And I'm trying to run
[57:35.030 --> 57:37.170]  towards him, but the wind is pushing him back.
[57:37.530 --> 57:38.970]  And I was like, Joe, you all right?
[57:39.490 --> 57:40.810]  And, uh, he stood up.
[57:41.650 --> 57:43.370]  And I guess his arm
[57:43.370 --> 57:44.970]  had caught that metal bit.
[57:45.770 --> 57:47.110]  And as he stood up,
[57:47.150 --> 57:49.110]  from, like, the inside of his elbow
[57:49.550 --> 57:51.650]  to, like, halfway up his bicep
[57:51.650 --> 57:52.810]  was just
[57:53.470 --> 57:55.150]  gaping open. And I was like,
[57:55.230 --> 57:57.390]  I was like, oh my God!
[57:57.710 --> 57:59.330]  Oh, Jesus! And I was like,
[57:59.390 --> 58:01.390]  do you want me to call you an ambulance?
[58:01.510 --> 58:03.430]  And he was like, no, no!
[58:03.710 --> 58:04.470]  And I was like,
[58:05.590 --> 58:07.170]  absolutely not. And I was like,
[58:07.370 --> 58:09.510]  no, you, dude, hold that
[58:09.510 --> 58:11.330]  close. It's like, there's so much
[58:11.330 --> 58:13.150]  blood! And it's like, I can see
[58:13.150 --> 58:15.290]  into your arm! And he was like, no, no,
[58:15.350 --> 58:17.370]  no, no, don't need an ambulance. And I'm like
[58:17.370 --> 58:18.850]  picking up my phone to call an ambulance.
[58:19.090 --> 58:21.410]  At this point, I realized, no idea what the emergency
[58:21.410 --> 58:23.290]  number is in Australia. Later found out
[58:23.290 --> 58:25.390]  it was 000, but that's good to know
[58:25.390 --> 58:27.310]  now. So I didn't know that. So I started
[58:27.310 --> 58:29.350]  holding down the power
[58:29.350 --> 58:31.350]  button on the phone, because that also lets
[58:31.350 --> 58:33.350]  you call emergency. And at that point, my
[58:33.350 --> 58:35.270]  phone was going like, whoop, whoop!
[58:35.470 --> 58:37.390]  As in to be like, you're about to call emergency. He heard
[58:37.390 --> 58:39.490]  that. He's like, don't do it! And I was like,
[58:39.490 --> 58:41.850]  but you need, you need like 20 stitches,
[58:41.950 --> 58:43.570]  man. And he's like, he's like, I'll
[58:43.570 --> 58:45.670]  go on my own. And we start walking.
[58:46.490 --> 58:47.450]  We start walking
[58:47.450 --> 58:49.050]  back down the pier. I'm behind him.
[58:49.250 --> 58:51.490]  And, uh, he's like struggling to
[58:51.490 --> 58:53.690]  hold his arm shut to the point where he stops.
[58:54.110 --> 58:55.130]  And, uh, I'm like,
[58:55.290 --> 58:57.630]  do you need me to like, do you want me to take my shirt off
[58:57.630 --> 58:59.290]  and like wrap it around you? And he's like,
[58:59.490 --> 59:01.250]  he was like, no, no, no. And at that point,
[59:01.290 --> 59:03.510]  while he was facing me back down
[59:03.510 --> 59:05.410]  the pier and I'm facing up, up
[59:05.410 --> 59:07.070]  the pier, the wind
[59:07.070 --> 59:08.270]  kicks up again.
[59:08.670 --> 59:10.950]  And it blew what felt like
[59:10.950 --> 59:12.330]  half a pint of his blood
[59:12.970 --> 59:13.770]  all over me.
[59:14.790 --> 59:17.090]  In my face, in my mouth,
[59:17.150 --> 59:18.670]  in my eyes, I'm suddenly,
[59:19.470 --> 59:20.870]  I watched like
[59:20.870 --> 59:22.870]  a flow of blood come out of his arm
[59:22.870 --> 59:24.670]  and just take to the wind.
[59:25.330 --> 59:26.970]  Splattered out like a big web
[59:26.970 --> 59:29.010]  and absolutely went all
[59:29.010 --> 59:31.010]  over me. And I'm, at this point, I'm just like
[59:31.010 --> 59:31.890]  aah!
[59:33.430 --> 59:35.010]  And I'm like, no, we gotta
[59:35.010 --> 59:36.610]  go turn around. And I'm like,
[59:37.510 --> 59:39.370]  I'm trying to do it without swallowing.
[59:40.430 --> 59:41.130]  Like we get
[59:41.130 --> 59:43.090]  to the end of the pier and he's like, I'm
[59:43.090 --> 59:44.550]  good from here. And I'm like, you're not!
[59:45.130 --> 59:46.990]  Hold on! And I, and I'm trying
[59:46.990 --> 59:49.230]  to like clean his blood out of my eyes and mouth.
[59:49.790 --> 59:51.030]  And in the distance, like back
[59:51.030 --> 59:53.170]  through the park I walked through, I remember I saw
[59:53.170 --> 59:54.870]  a water fountain. So I
[59:54.870 --> 59:56.450]  sprinted over to it.
[59:57.290 --> 59:59.050]  Lent over it. I'm like, I need to wash out my
[59:59.050 --> 01:00:00.750]  eyes and mouth and I'm still not,
[01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:02.710]  I'm still trying not to swallow his blood.
[01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:04.830]  So I'm hunched over the water fountain,
[01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:06.930]  the drinking fountain, holding down the button,
[01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:08.850]  but the freaking wind is blowing
[01:00:08.850 --> 01:00:10.210]  all the water away from my mouth!
[01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:12.970]  It's like blowing all around! I'm just like, I can't
[01:00:12.970 --> 01:00:14.530]  I can't get any in my mouth!
[01:00:14.650 --> 01:00:15.890]  I'm like, lent over, I'm like, aah!
[01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:18.750]  And I can't, it's like completely dry and the
[01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:20.290]  water's flicking, going all over the place.
[01:00:20.610 --> 01:00:22.690]  So I'm like shimmying around in a circle trying to
[01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:24.870]  block the wind, looking like an insane person,
[01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:26.910]  washing, trying to wash out my eyes
[01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:28.810]  and mouth and face. And then I
[01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:30.810]  I ran back to the
[01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:32.590]  end of the pier because I wanted to see what happened to this guy.
[01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:35.390]  And I can't find him, but I can find the blood trail.
[01:00:35.810 --> 01:00:36.830]  Oh my God!
[01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:38.830]  So I'm following these drips of blood
[01:00:38.830 --> 01:00:41.030]  and it went to this little car park.
[01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:42.950]  So I assume he got in a car
[01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:44.710]  or like someone was waiting for him in a car
[01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:46.570]  or something, because he immediately left
[01:00:46.570 --> 01:00:48.490]  and there was no more blood. And I spent
[01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:50.790]  15-20 minutes looking around to see
[01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:52.830]  if I could see him or like see if he'd passed out
[01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:54.610]  in a bush or something or see any more blood.
[01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:56.870]  Couldn't find him. And then, uh,
[01:00:57.130 --> 01:00:58.770]  I sort of, this is where all the pictures
[01:00:58.770 --> 01:01:00.890]  have ended, by the way, because I'm no longer
[01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:02.130]  providing official aids.
[01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:04.650]  And, uh, I sort of
[01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:06.870]  thousand yards stared my way
[01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:08.610]  back to the hotel and
[01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:10.290]  as I was walking up to the hotel, I was like,
[01:01:10.790 --> 01:01:12.790]  oh, I'm covered in blood. I'm
[01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:14.790]  covered in what might be a dead guy's blood.
[01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:16.550]  All up from head to toe.
[01:01:17.110 --> 01:01:18.010]  And I just
[01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:20.670]  powered in the front door of the hotel right
[01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:22.670]  past the desk, straight into the lift,
[01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:24.630]  took my shirt off. I was like
[01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:26.450]  scrubbing all the blood off in the bath.
[01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:28.530]  I took a shower and I ended up just crying
[01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:29.390]  in the shower.
[01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:32.750]  And I was just,
[01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:34.630]  I ended up just so traumatized
[01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:36.010]  by it. I was like, I can't believe it happened.
[01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:38.570]  And I didn't really do a good job. Like I didn't really even help
[01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:39.750]  him. I hope he's all right.
[01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:42.610]  And, uh, I never told anyone
[01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:44.570]  that story that whole day.
[01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:46.410]  I just couldn't bring myself to like bring
[01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:47.710]  my mind back to that place.
[01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:50.430]  Cause I kept seeing like all the intense visuals
[01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:52.550]  of his open flesh. I'm not very
[01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:54.470]  good with blood. And then we did like the whole show.
[01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:56.130]  This was like the end of the show that night
[01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:58.630]  where we'd been doing, uh, we'd been
[01:01:58.630 --> 01:02:00.390]  chugging beer and running around playing Mary
[01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:02.490]  Cart. And at some point I just ended up lying on the
[01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:04.510]  floor of the stage, just reflecting on the day
[01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:06.510]  as a whole. Why don't I have a shirt on
[01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:07.390]  in this fucking photo?
[01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:10.290]  I don't know. It's very similar to now.
[01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:12.430]  Yeah. So that was, uh,
[01:02:12.610 --> 01:02:14.150]  that's my Australia story. That was Melbourne.
[01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:16.290]  Um... I feel like you
[01:02:16.290 --> 01:02:18.570]  encountered Anton Chigurh on a fucking
[01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:20.250]  pier. Like that's the only
[01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:22.470]  like the unwillingness to
[01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:24.630]  get help when his arm is clearly
[01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:26.930]  like fucked. Dude. Just completely.
[01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:28.410]  The guy was aggressively having
[01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:30.510]  none of my help. He was probably
[01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:32.550]  a criminal and he didn't want the cops to come.
[01:02:32.830 --> 01:02:34.490]  He didn't want the ambulance to come. That's what I'm saying.
[01:02:34.810 --> 01:02:36.490]  They'd have to run his, yeah, he's probably like, it could
[01:02:36.490 --> 01:02:38.670]  have been like... Anton Chigurh. Yeah, Anton Chigurh
[01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:40.670]  or like just some like New York Mafia guy
[01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:41.870]  who's hiding out in Australia.
[01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:43.810]  Like no police, no cops, no cops.
[01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:46.610]  I was like zoning in and out for the rest
[01:02:46.610 --> 01:02:48.050]  of that Australia trip of just like,
[01:02:48.370 --> 01:02:50.450]  oh God, I can't believe what happened that night.
[01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:52.450]  And it wasn't even that
[01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:54.090]  bad. Like, it's not like I've watched someone
[01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:56.290]  get hit by a car or something.
[01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:58.230]  It would be much more worse. It was just the
[01:02:58.870 --> 01:03:00.330]  speed that he went from
[01:03:00.330 --> 01:03:02.150]  just strolling down the pier to
[01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:04.330]  severely injured from nowhere.
[01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:06.450]  Just like resonated weird with me.
[01:03:06.490 --> 01:03:08.350]  I felt so icky after that. I was like, oh.
[01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:10.430]  And then I was also worried that I, you know,
[01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:12.350]  had some sort of foreign blood
[01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:14.430]  borne illness in my eyes and mouth. So there was
[01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:15.990]  that fear as well. I was like, do I
[01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:18.470]  go to a doctor now? Do I tell people about
[01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:20.490]  this? I just
[01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:22.610]  didn't know what to do. So I ended up flying home with a bloody
[01:03:22.610 --> 01:03:23.250]  t-shirt.
[01:03:24.310 --> 01:03:25.930]  You saved the t-shirt?
[01:03:26.590 --> 01:03:28.410]  Yeah. And I don't know if you can tell from the
[01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:30.470]  windy video I
[01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:32.670]  posted earlier. Nice white t-shirt
[01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:34.330]  that was. Really showed all the blood.
[01:03:34.450 --> 01:03:36.610]  Real good. Gavin, I'm going to show you the perspective
[01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:38.310]  I got from your windy video.
[01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:40.450]  This is what I saw.
[01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:42.430]  Just that and wind blowing.
[01:03:45.850 --> 01:03:46.730]  This was
[01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:47.170]  the other
[01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:48.950]  perspective I got. It was just
[01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:51.070]  this image with the audio of
[01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:53.150]  wind blowing. That was all the
[01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:54.990]  visual aid that I got. But I guess I do see the
[01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:56.410]  shirt. That is a very white shirt.
[01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:58.930]  It's a very white shirt. And as you can see
[01:03:58.930 --> 01:04:00.990]  from the picture of me on stage, I changed my
[01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:02.730]  shirt. You still have the shirt
[01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:03.730]  that's covered in blood?
[01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:06.790]  I think I've mainly washed out.
[01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:08.790]  I think I washed out because I don't remember it.
[01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:12.410]  That'd be wild. Honestly, my
[01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:14.070]  brain has never seen this as a funny event.
[01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:16.310]  It's just trying to repress it
[01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:17.070]  as much as possible.
[01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:19.710]  I don't know why I stopped taking photos.
[01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:22.390]  It's very un-me-like
[01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:24.310]  to not document what happened afterwards.
[01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:25.790]  Well, you were traumatized.
[01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:27.990]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:30.010]  You were experiencing trauma in the moment.
[01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:32.490]  You're right. It's not funny
[01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:34.410]  at all. It's like when I told the story about finding the old
[01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:36.350]  lady who had fallen down in the
[01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:38.310]  woods by my house. There's nothing funny
[01:04:38.310 --> 01:04:39.930]  about it. It's just a bizarre
[01:04:40.550 --> 01:04:40.910]  circumstance.
[01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:44.110]  That's one of the craziest stories
[01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:45.450]  I have ever heard in my life.
[01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:47.750]  I can't believe when you teased it the other day
[01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:50.210]  you said you were afraid it might be a C-story.
[01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:52.050]  Well, it's just not very
[01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:53.970]  funny. It's like funny
[01:04:53.970 --> 01:04:56.250]  because it's not funny. It doesn't have to be funny. It's insane.
[01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:57.730]  I told Meg
[01:04:57.730 --> 01:04:59.970]  and she could not believe I'd
[01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:00.370]  never told her.
[01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:03.450]  I was like, do you think it'd be good for f***face?
[01:05:03.550 --> 01:05:05.710]  She'd be like, oh, you've got to tell that
[01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:05.990]  on there.
[01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.650]  Yeah.
[01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:09.970]  That also goes to show you
[01:05:09.970 --> 01:05:11.990]  how f***ing precarious and
[01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:13.290]  fragile life is.
[01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:15.610]  A gust of wind
[01:05:15.610 --> 01:05:17.410]  took that guy out.
[01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:19.030]  In
[01:05:19.830 --> 01:05:21.070]  fairness, it was a
[01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:23.850]  probably the biggest wind I've ever felt.
[01:05:24.330 --> 01:05:25.490]  And I've lived with you for
[01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:26.370]  10 years.
[01:05:28.790 --> 01:05:29.730]  Dude, that's a f***ing...
[01:05:29.730 --> 01:05:31.230]  I don't know how you've held on to that story
[01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.950]  since 2019.
[01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:35.230]  Yeah,
[01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:36.830]  that you haven't... I would be
[01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:38.570]  convinced that I was going to be a
[01:05:38.570 --> 01:05:40.610]  28 Days Later zombie immediately
[01:05:40.610 --> 01:05:43.150]  as soon as I got covered in blood. Everybody would know.
[01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:44.270]  I'd be screaming.
[01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:46.090]  I would not handle that well.
[01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:48.670]  No kidding. I would have been like, don't touch me!
[01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:50.050]  I have AIDS. I have AIDS now.
[01:05:50.350 --> 01:05:52.050]  I have every disease.
[01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:53.990]  I have all the heps.
[01:05:54.410 --> 01:05:57.010]  I have hep A through Z. Just stay away from me.
[01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:57.970]  Quarantine me.
[01:05:58.390 --> 01:06:00.950]  And the thing about like...
[01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:03.250]  It's like real trauma. It was like slightly traumatizing
[01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:04.950]  as an event, but it's not like I had
[01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:06.430]  PTSD from this event.
[01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:09.070]  But it is interesting when you have those events
[01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:11.030]  and you think about it from very strange
[01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:12.070]  angles. Like,
[01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:15.030]  a week earlier, that guy was just
[01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:16.850]  walking about, not knowing that
[01:06:16.850 --> 01:06:18.990]  a week from now, someone from America would come to
[01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:21.130]  Australia and end up with his blood
[01:06:21.130 --> 01:06:21.850]  in his mouth.
[01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:24.750]  A week earlier? How about 8 minutes earlier?
[01:06:25.050 --> 01:06:25.370]  Yeah!
[01:06:27.210 --> 01:06:28.830]  That guy's relationship
[01:06:28.830 --> 01:06:30.810]  with the wind has forever changed.
[01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:32.870]  Every single breeze.
[01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:34.770]  It's like, this motherfucker.
[01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:37.070]  Yeah, so he's like a wind chime
[01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:38.070]  as a warning device.
[01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:39.910]  Everybody get down.
[01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:42.810]  I kept my eye closely on the local
[01:06:42.810 --> 01:06:44.630]  Melbourne news for the next week.
[01:06:45.290 --> 01:06:46.750]  Well, it also just goes to show you
[01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:48.430]  Australians are insane.
[01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:50.510]  And like, in the coolest ways,
[01:06:50.610 --> 01:06:52.590]  they just don't give a fuck. That guy's like,
[01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:54.830]  I'll wrap it up. He probably wrapped duct tape on it
[01:06:54.830 --> 01:06:55.430]  and went about his business.
[01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:57.510]  Yeah, and they have, I assume
[01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:59.030]  they have a free healthcare.
[01:06:59.510 --> 01:07:01.510]  Some form of healthcare. There are stitches
[01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:02.670]  and
[01:07:04.050 --> 01:07:05.730]  antibiotics in Australia, for sure.
[01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:07.130]  I don't know.
[01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:09.450]  People here don't like to call an ambulance because it costs
[01:07:09.450 --> 01:07:09.790]  them money.
[01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:13.450]  I'm not sure that's a thing there. I don't think you pay for an ambulance.
[01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:15.370]  I can't. I'm trying to just
[01:07:15.370 --> 01:07:17.490]  process what that would be. Like, everything.
[01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:19.510]  That is an insane event to happen.
[01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:21.550]  How about the fact that
[01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:23.450]  like, 3 hours later, you and I were hanging
[01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:25.290]  out together, and you didn't even cross
[01:07:25.790 --> 01:07:27.090]  like, I had no idea.
[01:07:27.350 --> 01:07:29.490]  I think that was the show, because it was
[01:07:29.490 --> 01:07:31.670]  Melbourne, I think that was maybe the show
[01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:33.570]  where we filmed that Instagram video
[01:07:33.570 --> 01:07:35.390]  of us all singing Wrecking Ball or whatever.
[01:07:35.570 --> 01:07:37.510]  Like, the entire group. And we were all dancing
[01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:39.450]  around together. And like, 2 hours later, you were
[01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:40.950]  bathing in somebody else's blood.
[01:07:42.550 --> 01:07:43.450]  That's the image
[01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:45.510]  of what you're thinking every time you hear Wrecked Me.
[01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:46.950]  Just like, I suck.
[01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:49.150]  I fucking destroyed her.
[01:07:49.610 --> 01:07:51.450]  There's something just so funny about
[01:07:51.450 --> 01:07:53.470]  coming back to a hotel room
[01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:55.490]  covered in sweat and blood before 9am.
[01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:57.590]  It was so early that day.
[01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:01.470]  That's gotta be one of the worst
[01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:02.850]  ways to walk into a hotel lobby.
[01:08:03.090 --> 01:08:04.450]  Because you definitely feel like
[01:08:05.810 --> 01:08:06.250]  you're
[01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:09.010]  Jason Bourne in the Bourne Identity.
[01:08:09.330 --> 01:08:11.670]  They're just gonna be like, yeah, no problem, sir.
[01:08:11.970 --> 01:08:13.830]  They're calling Interpol right now.
[01:08:15.010 --> 01:08:15.650]  You said
[01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:17.050]  9am is one of the worst times.
[01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:19.330]  What is a good time? I don't feel like there's a
[01:08:19.330 --> 01:08:21.150]  great time to walk into a hotel covered
[01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:22.330]  in sweat and blood.
[01:08:23.070 --> 01:08:25.450]  You just can't sit down with a beer after that.
[01:08:25.570 --> 01:08:26.310]  It's too early, you know?
[01:08:27.010 --> 01:08:27.730]  I see what you're saying.
[01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.770]  Sure.
[01:08:31.410 --> 01:08:33.290]  And I had a long time between that
[01:08:33.290 --> 01:08:34.310]  and the Tech Hustle.
[01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.990]  Um, that's it.
[01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:41.110]  Well, Gav, thanks for telling that story.
[01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:43.130]  That's hands down one of the best
[01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:44.550]  stories in the history of F***base.
[01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.530]  For sure.
[01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:47.410]  One for
[01:08:47.410 --> 01:08:48.990]  Regulation Animation one day.
[01:08:49.790 --> 01:08:51.010]  Oh Jesus Christ!
[01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:53.410]  Oh my God.
[01:08:53.570 --> 01:08:54.850]  And by the way, I'm so sorry.
[01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:56.790]  That's one terrible thing to go through.
[01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:57.830]  That's horrible.
[01:08:58.690 --> 01:09:01.090]  Thankfully, you look back on it fondly.
[01:09:01.230 --> 01:09:03.210]  I just hope you didn't die. I'm pretty sure you didn't.
[01:09:03.750 --> 01:09:05.170]  And if you didn't, it's
[01:09:05.170 --> 01:09:07.170]  a crazy story.
[01:09:07.930 --> 01:09:08.990]  You know what it reminds me of?
[01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:11.770]  It reminds me of you and I on the
[01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:13.550]  ferry in Australia
[01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:14.610]  going from Sydney
[01:09:16.090 --> 01:09:16.970]  over to...
[01:09:17.830 --> 01:09:18.770]  What's that beach?
[01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:20.710]  That we always would go over to.
[01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:22.630]  Manly Beach?
[01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:25.350]  Taking the ferry over to Manly Beach
[01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:27.130]  and we're at the front of that thing and
[01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:29.510]  you and I go to drink our water and the wind
[01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:31.190]  picks up and it shoots the water
[01:09:31.190 --> 01:09:33.710]  all over those two girls in front of us
[01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:35.250]  and it was like...
[01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:36.230]  We couldn't take a sip.
[01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:38.710]  They got 80% of our water instantly
[01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:41.250]  through our mouths and into their heads
[01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:43.370]  and their hair. And they were horrified.
[01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:45.690]  It was like that, but with blood.
[01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:49.050]  Oh. Fuck.
[01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.970]  Jesus.
[01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:53.350]  Andrew, what was the thing that you were gonna do that might have
[01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:55.190]  pissed off Geoff? I can't say
[01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:56.510]  because I'm gonna do it one day.
[01:09:56.810 --> 01:09:59.270]  But now is not the
[01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:00.930]  greatest time to do it.
[01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:03.230]  And we decided we're
[01:10:03.230 --> 01:10:05.070]  sticking with season 4 through episode 100.
[01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:07.430]  Yeah, I think season 4 barely started.
[01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:09.050]  I think season 4 was strong.
[01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:11.050]  Yeah, it's been a good season.
[01:10:11.410 --> 01:10:12.410]  Season 4's been good so far.
[01:10:12.930 --> 01:10:14.910]  It's definitely been one of my favorite seasons.
[01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:16.750]  Yeah, I agree with Eric. Let's keep it rolling.
[01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:18.750]  Eric, you never figured out what year
[01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:19.930]  episode 1000 comes out.
[01:10:21.170 --> 01:10:22.550]  So we're roughly
[01:10:23.090 --> 01:10:24.530]  at the two year mark.
[01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:27.270]  We started in June of 2020
[01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:29.010]  and this will be coming out
[01:10:29.010 --> 01:10:30.290]  the day that you can listen to this
[01:10:30.850 --> 01:10:33.050]  is April 27th.
[01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:35.370]  So roughly two years
[01:10:35.370 --> 01:10:37.070]  per 100 episodes.
[01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:39.570]  So for every...
[01:10:39.570 --> 01:10:40.990]  Yeah, so you'd say
[01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:42.030]  roughly around that.
[01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:44.930]  So we just have to...
[01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:47.170]  Geoff, you gonna keep it going for that long?
[01:10:47.290 --> 01:10:48.070]  I just mean like
[01:10:48.670 --> 01:10:51.050]  health wise. You got like enough teeth
[01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:53.150]  that you can root canal for like 18 more years
[01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:53.710]  of this or whatever?
[01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:56.050]  Sorry, I'll be honest. I zoned out for a minute.
[01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:59.090]  Cool, man. Right on. Thank you so much. That's awesome.
[01:10:59.430 --> 01:10:59.750]  Thank you.
[01:10:59.830 --> 01:11:02.350]  You appreciate it, dude.
[01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:04.650]  Yeah, 18 years?
[01:11:04.650 --> 01:11:06.450]  Yeah, I can go 18 years.
[01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:08.590]  Here's what we should do. Even if we don't do this
[01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:10.570]  podcast for the next 18 years. Say it stops
[01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:12.810]  at like 200. We come back
[01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.610]  18 years from now and just do
[01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:16.510]  episode 1000. Even if there hasn't been
[01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:18.570]  episode 200 to
[01:11:19.190 --> 01:11:20.590]  1000. Dude, I'm gonna be
[01:11:20.590 --> 01:11:22.690]  very disappointed if we stop at 200.
[01:11:22.930 --> 01:11:24.790]  I feel like we're building momentum every day
[01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:26.250]  and all the supplemental
[01:11:27.010 --> 01:11:28.510]  content's starting to come out. We're starting to
[01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:30.690]  film more, do more. We got MVP 2
[01:11:30.690 --> 01:11:32.690]  ahead of us. Imagine what movies
[01:11:32.690 --> 01:11:34.490]  we'll be watching together by episode 1000.
[01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:36.330]  We should schedule MVP 2.
[01:11:36.670 --> 01:11:37.690]  Yeah, we should. Big time.
[01:11:37.810 --> 01:11:38.170]  Fuck.
[01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:42.670]  Would there be more apples
[01:11:42.670 --> 01:11:44.250]  to eat? I think we should do a
[01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:46.530]  like, if we can get it, I think we should do a
[01:11:46.530 --> 01:11:48.610]  Bovril taste test like we did with the apple.
[01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:50.070]  With the Cosmic Crisp taste test.
[01:11:50.150 --> 01:11:52.670]  If Andrew doesn't keep rejecting my shipment, maybe he'll be able to
[01:11:52.670 --> 01:11:53.210]  try it.
[01:11:56.170 --> 01:11:56.750]  I'll check.
[01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:58.630]  I'll get it in the mail room as soon as we're done recording.
[01:11:58.870 --> 01:12:00.630]  I did hear, I did see somebody
[01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:02.890]  mention that it is, it does exist in Canada.
[01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:04.690]  Somebody was like, I'm Canadian and I
[01:12:04.690 --> 01:12:06.650]  have it all the time. Yeah, I guess they banned it.
[01:12:06.970 --> 01:12:08.910]  They banned it with Marmite
[01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:10.570]  and like some other thing because it didn't fit
[01:12:10.570 --> 01:12:12.810]  food standards in like 2015
[01:12:12.810 --> 01:12:14.570]  and then
[01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:16.530]  they had to like change the recipe or
[01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:18.610]  they like, you can buy it now, but there
[01:12:18.610 --> 01:12:20.390]  was a time in which it was banned in Canada.
[01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:22.590]  Canada hates
[01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:24.590]  shit. No doorknobs, no Bovril.
[01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:25.550]  Yeah.
[01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:30.090]  This was fun.
[01:12:30.370 --> 01:12:31.530]  I'm excited for you to try it.
[01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:34.210]  I'm excited to try it. Maybe next episode.
[01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:36.010]  Definitely next episode.
[01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:38.090]  As long as it's not rejected.
[01:12:38.710 --> 01:12:40.350]  Well Gavin, thanks for
[01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:41.810]  sharing
[01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:44.510]  an absolute 100
[01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:46.110]  of a story
[01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:47.230]  on episode 100.
[01:12:48.210 --> 01:12:49.870]  I hope
[01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:52.470]  my tattoo bit
[01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:53.990]  played well with you guys.
[01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:56.210]  So good. I have never
[01:12:56.210 --> 01:12:58.610]  in all the 6,000 tattoos
[01:12:58.610 --> 01:13:00.350]  I have, I've never recorded myself
[01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:02.570]  or tried to perform while getting one.
[01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.570]  It's
[01:13:04.570 --> 01:13:05.390]  not... yeah.
[01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:08.150]  It was great. Ribs
[01:13:08.770 --> 01:13:10.470]  are... don't get a tattoo on your
[01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:12.410]  ribs. Just don't. I'll just say that right now.
[01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:13.790]  You keep doing it though.
[01:13:14.230 --> 01:13:15.930]  I really... well I'm running out of ribs.
[01:13:16.290 --> 01:13:18.170]  Andrew, I really appreciate you
[01:13:18.170 --> 01:13:20.310]  not unleashing whatever banana
[01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:22.590]  related fury or port-a-potty
[01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:24.230]  attack or whatever it was on me.
[01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:26.230]  Look forward to that in the near future.
[01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.650]  And then
[01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:30.250]  by that token, if you would like to contribute
[01:13:30.250 --> 01:13:31.890]  anything to 100, now's your chance.
[01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:34.190]  I feel like I've
[01:13:36.010 --> 01:13:36.490]  contributed...
[01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:38.090]  so many.
[01:13:38.530 --> 01:13:40.510]  That was mean, Geoff.
[01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:42.050]  That was...
[01:13:42.570 --> 01:13:43.850]  I was caught off guard.
[01:13:45.150 --> 01:13:45.970]  You know what?
[01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:48.490]  I could gladly contribute
[01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:50.170]  to 100 right now. Let's do the thing.
[01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:51.950]  I could just pull the trigger on the thing.
[01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:53.810]  I was trying to be nice, Geoff.
[01:13:54.170 --> 01:13:55.690]  I was trying to be a nice guy.
[01:13:56.710 --> 01:13:58.330]  Let's go. Let's pull the trigger
[01:13:58.330 --> 01:14:00.390]  on this thing. Thanks so much
[01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:02.510]  for tuning in and listening
[01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:04.530]  to episode 100 of all
[01:14:04.530 --> 01:14:06.490]  100 episodes of Face, I'm
[01:14:06.490 --> 01:14:07.750]  assuming. And
[01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:10.330]  we'll see you next week. Y'all take
[01:14:10.330 --> 01:14:12.230]  care. Like and
[01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:14.230]  review. What'd you say? Wait.
[01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:15.430]  Eric wrote something.
[01:14:15.930 --> 01:14:16.510]  Oh, whatever.
[01:14:16.710 --> 01:14:19.370]  By the time this is out, Gavin will have done the RT
[01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:21.350]  podcast in 64 pieces of clothes.
[01:14:21.370 --> 01:14:23.490]  Oh, great. That's exciting. Oh, yeah. How's that going,
[01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:25.250]  Gav? Yeah, I'm excited about it.
[01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:27.290]  Am I doing the Donkey Kong tie?
[01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:29.550]  Are we putting that on as well? You don't need to.
[01:14:29.610 --> 01:14:31.270]  If you want, you can. You can use it if you want.
[01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:33.470]  I like that I've worked for this company
[01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:35.370]  for 10 years and then like twice
[01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:37.450]  in the same week, I'm being forced to wear two different
[01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:39.490]  red ties. Because I just did
[01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:40.710]  a Hitman video where I wore one.
[01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:43.390]  That
[01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:45.150]  preview of you 15 years from now
[01:14:45.150 --> 01:14:46.530]  in the bald cap was really funny.
[01:14:47.090 --> 01:14:48.850]  15? 5 maybe.
[01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:52.750]  In all seriousness,
[01:14:53.410 --> 01:14:55.470]  is there anything else we need to cover before we...
[01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:56.510]  No, I think we should do the outro.
[01:14:57.170 --> 01:14:57.950]  Okay. That was it.
[01:14:59.350 --> 01:15:01.230]  Well, shit. That was 100
[01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:02.390]  episodes. Time flew.
[01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:04.370]  That's crazy. Can I...
[01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:07.410]  I do have a question. What the fuck?
[01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:08.130]  Why?
[01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:09.610]  It sucks.
[01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:11.510]  It'll be quick.
[01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:13.690]  Is a football a ball?
[01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:15.670]  This is the thing I was trying to
[01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:16.690]  figure out.
[01:15:17.670 --> 01:15:19.370]  In what way could it not...
[01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:21.590]  In what way could it possibly not be
[01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:23.150]  a ball? Well, okay.
[01:15:23.150 --> 01:15:25.150]  Let me give you a more specific...
[01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:27.530]  I didn't know if it was a thing
[01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:29.270]  like a strawberry. It says
[01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:31.310]  berry in the name, but it's not a berry.
[01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:33.370]  I was wondering...
[01:15:33.370 --> 01:15:35.190]  Do you ever throw a
[01:15:35.190 --> 01:15:36.650]  Nerf Vortex, Gavin?
[01:15:37.050 --> 01:15:38.910]  Yeah. The little whistly thing?
[01:15:39.330 --> 01:15:40.790]  Yeah. It's one of my
[01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:42.350]  favorite. I was thinking about
[01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:44.270]  what are the greatest balls of all time.
[01:15:44.730 --> 01:15:46.610]  And I think the Nerf Vortex might be
[01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:48.650]  number one. But I didn't know
[01:15:48.650 --> 01:15:50.010]  if it would be considered a ball or not.
[01:15:50.530 --> 01:15:52.530]  Is that a ball? It's a football. More of a foam
[01:15:52.530 --> 01:15:54.790]  dart. You think it's a foam dart?
[01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:56.930]  And not a football? It's pretty darty
[01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:58.310]  considering the flights on the back.
[01:15:58.750 --> 01:16:00.490]  But the movement, like the throw,
[01:16:00.610 --> 01:16:01.970]  it's a football product.
[01:16:03.210 --> 01:16:04.690]  Which then made me wonder, is a
[01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:06.450]  football in itself an actual
[01:16:06.450 --> 01:16:08.590]  ball, or does it not fall
[01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:10.650]  in the ball category despite the
[01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:12.590]  name football? I mean, it's
[01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:14.270]  got the name ball in the name.
[01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:16.410]  But so does strawberry. But according
[01:16:16.410 --> 01:16:18.590]  to Wikipedia,
[01:16:19.050 --> 01:16:19.990]  which is never wrong,
[01:16:20.490 --> 01:16:22.770]  a football is a ball inflated with air
[01:16:22.770 --> 01:16:24.710]  used to play one of the various sports
[01:16:24.710 --> 01:16:26.390]  known as football. So apparently
[01:16:27.170 --> 01:16:28.730]  it is, yes,
[01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:29.810]  a ball. Okay.
[01:16:30.910 --> 01:16:32.470]  Well then I would go with the Nerf Vortex
[01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:34.070]  as the greatest ball overall.
[01:16:34.810 --> 01:16:35.950]  What was the best thing on Quibi?
[01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:38.450]  Uh, I only watched a show.
[01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:40.230]  It was this horror one
[01:16:40.230 --> 01:16:42.170]  with, um, what was the
[01:16:42.170 --> 01:16:44.610]  the fucking, he was, I never saw
[01:16:44.610 --> 01:16:46.390]  the Amazing Spider-Man. He played the Green
[01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:47.970]  Goblin in the Amazing Spider-Man.
[01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:50.390]  What was his name? You know who I'm
[01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:52.270]  talking about? I think his name,
[01:16:52.530 --> 01:16:54.590]  he played Andrew in the movie Chronicle
[01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:56.510]  as well. I don't
[01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:58.330]  know his name. He was in it,
[01:16:58.370 --> 01:17:00.330]  and I believe the female lead
[01:17:00.330 --> 01:17:02.410]  was the woman that was in The Guest
[01:17:02.850 --> 01:17:04.450]  and, uh, It Follows?
[01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:06.090]  I don't know her name either.
[01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:07.850]  It's the only thing I watched.
[01:17:08.370 --> 01:17:10.010]  Oh, what is her name?
[01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:12.270]  She was, like, in a bunch of really good
[01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:14.290]  indie movies at the time, and
[01:17:14.290 --> 01:17:16.410]  I don't feel like I've seen anything in years.
[01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:18.410]  Uh, which is surprising. She's
[01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:20.570]  great. She's great in It Follows, she's great in The Guest.
[01:17:21.010 --> 01:17:22.190]  According to the dictionary,
[01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:24.370]  the definition of
[01:17:24.370 --> 01:17:26.390]  a ball is a solid or
[01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:28.410]  hollow spherical or egg
[01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:30.250]  shaped object that is kicked, thrown,
[01:17:30.370 --> 01:17:32.470]  or hit in a game. So, egg-shaped
[01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:34.190]  I think fits. Yeah, egg-shaped
[01:17:34.190 --> 01:17:36.050]  I think is fair. With a football. Yeah.
[01:17:36.490 --> 01:17:37.790]  That works. Huh.
[01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:40.390]  Okay. There you go. But what's the name of
[01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:42.350]  the guy from The Amazing Spider-Man that was the Green
[01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:44.150]  Goblin? What's his name?
[01:17:44.290 --> 01:17:46.190]  Isn't Willem Dafoe? That's not the
[01:17:46.190 --> 01:17:47.790]  one that was with Andrew Garfield.
[01:17:48.150 --> 01:17:50.330]  The Amazing Spider-Man. I didn't see
[01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:52.590]  that. I didn't know the Green Goblin was in that. I think he is.
[01:17:53.150 --> 01:17:54.930]  I don't think it's wrong. I thought it was Lizard Man and, uh...
[01:17:54.930 --> 01:17:56.550]  Hold on, I'm looking. Electric Man.
[01:17:57.170 --> 01:17:58.870]  I think the Green Goblin's in that.
[01:17:59.030 --> 01:18:01.430]  Oh, oh, oh. It's, uh...
[01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:02.650]  What does this get? What is this dude's
[01:18:02.650 --> 01:18:04.550]  name? Uh...
[01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:06.090]  That guy. Yeah.
[01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:08.690]  Eric just posted a photo. That guy. What's his
[01:18:08.690 --> 01:18:10.630]  name? Dane DeHaan?
[01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:12.210]  Dane DeHaan. Dane DeHaan.
[01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:13.970]  There we go. Dane DeHaan. Thank you.
[01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:16.530]  Can I make a complaint with you, Gavin?
[01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:18.450]  This sucks. What's happening?
[01:18:18.450 --> 01:18:20.590]  Thank you. That's what I was about to complain about.
[01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:22.630]  Why haven't you ended this, Eric? Why haven't you
[01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:24.230]  yelled at us? Because this is just going on.
[01:18:24.230 --> 01:18:26.290]  Guys, thank you. 100 episodes of
[01:18:26.290 --> 01:18:28.270]  this podcast, and it seems like it's never gonna
[01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:30.190]  end, is it? What's the next sports-related
[01:18:30.190 --> 01:18:32.210]  thing that's gonna be going on? Will we see what's going
[01:18:32.210 --> 01:18:34.230]  on with my hubby's bagels? I can't wait to eat
[01:18:34.630 --> 01:18:36.270]  Bovril. All this
[01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:38.350]  and more, continuing in Season 4
[01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:40.030]  of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:18:40.270 --> 01:18:42.450]  Thank you so much for listening. Uh, leave
[01:18:42.450 --> 01:18:44.470]  a rating, subscribe,
[01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:46.210]  go grab your friend's phone
[01:18:46.210 --> 01:18:48.410]  and subscribe for them, and make sure you listen
[01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:50.270]  on their phone as well. It'll
[01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:52.110]  help everyone out. Thank you so much, and goodbye.
[01:18:52.110 --> 01:18:54.330]  I think you're supposed to drink
[01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:56.190]  Bovril, not eat it. This sucks.
[01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:58.070]  Goodbye. Goodbye, end it. Goodbye.
[01:18:58.570 --> 01:19:00.210]  Hey guys, Minor League Fan Jack
[01:19:00.210 --> 01:19:02.030]  here with a look at next week's episode of
[01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:04.090]  F*** Face. Once again, the guys haven't
[01:19:04.090 --> 01:19:06.230]  recorded yet, so here's some predictions for the next
[01:19:06.230 --> 01:19:08.290]  week's episode. Let's talk about
[01:19:08.290 --> 01:19:10.270]  balls. Who's the previously on
[01:19:10.270 --> 01:19:12.430]  guy? Geoff experienced Bovril.
[01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:14.010]  Panton talks bagels.
[01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:16.110]  Gavin has a wasp problem again.
[01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:18.250]  And once again, Andrew does
[01:19:18.250 --> 01:19:20.270]  not eat the pencil. All that and more
[01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:22.230]  on next week's episode of F*** Face.
