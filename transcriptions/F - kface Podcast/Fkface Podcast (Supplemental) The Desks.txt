[00:31.180 --> 00:33.060]  Because we've stacked tables!
[00:38.240 --> 00:39.760]  We've stacked three tables.
[00:40.440 --> 00:42.700]  I have power running to it already.
[00:43.100 --> 00:47.380]  We have two controls on the left and one control on the side up here.
[00:47.580 --> 00:49.100]  That's just... I'm working with what we have.
[00:49.700 --> 00:52.640]  So we'll have to get someone on the side over here with this chair.
[00:53.440 --> 00:54.920]  I think we need a two-fer on this.
[00:55.160 --> 00:56.900]  Because once this stretches...
[00:56.900 --> 00:59.380]  Who's got the biggest wingspan for two buttons?
[00:59.380 --> 01:01.760]  Well, why don't we just have Geoff on the bottom one...
[01:01.760 --> 01:03.280]  Nick on the middle one...
[01:03.280 --> 01:04.800]  And Gracie on the top one on this chair.
[01:04.940 --> 01:05.760]  And I'll be on the top.
[01:06.080 --> 01:07.180]  No, you're not going to be on the top.
[01:07.280 --> 01:08.200]  But you can witness...
[01:08.200 --> 01:09.120]  Wait, you're not going on the top?
[01:09.340 --> 01:10.240]  Okay, here's the thing.
[01:10.740 --> 01:11.920]  I don't condone it.
[01:12.860 --> 01:13.220]  But...
[01:13.620 --> 01:15.200]  You should definitely sit if you're going to do it.
[01:15.200 --> 01:16.400]  That's why I said get a mat.
[01:17.680 --> 01:19.040]  Dang, that's crazy!
[01:19.480 --> 01:20.780]  Gavin, a mat?
[01:21.720 --> 01:23.260]  Gavin, did you say a mat?
[01:23.340 --> 01:24.760]  But you just said you didn't want me to go on it.
[01:26.140 --> 01:27.840]  Deceived two times, I see!
[01:28.800 --> 01:30.220]  Gavin thought of it all!
[01:30.760 --> 01:32.500]  So we should raise me on just one.
[01:33.040 --> 01:33.780]  And see how it is?
[01:33.940 --> 01:34.960]  And calculate the speed.
[01:35.520 --> 01:37.220]  Okay, how's that part go?
[01:37.440 --> 01:38.680]  How are we measuring this?
[01:38.700 --> 01:39.140]  Tape measure.
[01:39.800 --> 01:40.740]  Stand on the end of it.
[01:41.780 --> 01:43.800]  And over a period of time...
[01:43.800 --> 01:44.740]  Say two seconds.
[01:45.340 --> 01:47.060]  We'll see how far I went.
[01:47.780 --> 01:49.600]  Speed equals distance over time.
[01:50.460 --> 01:51.100]  Measure it.
[01:52.640 --> 01:54.120]  You're going to have to be holding it from way up there.
[01:54.960 --> 01:56.820]  Okay, let me see if I can find a tape measure.
[01:56.820 --> 01:58.340]  Geoff, do you want to help me find a tape measure?
[01:58.680 --> 02:00.760]  I feel like he doesn't...
[02:00.760 --> 02:01.580]  Are you looking for a tape measure?
[02:01.800 --> 02:02.860]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:04.700 --> 02:05.240]  Tape measure.
[02:05.980 --> 02:06.600]  Oh, okay.
[02:08.840 --> 02:09.200]  Sorry.
[02:10.740 --> 02:12.280]  Okay, so how do you want to do this?
[02:12.400 --> 02:13.100]  I'll be here.
[02:13.820 --> 02:15.640]  We'll raise just one desk.
[02:17.140 --> 02:18.060]  Tape measure will be on the floor.
[02:18.660 --> 02:20.100]  Because it's all relative to the floor.
[02:20.580 --> 02:21.440]  We'll time it.
[02:21.560 --> 02:23.640]  Let's say three seconds of lift.
[02:24.280 --> 02:26.800]  We'll take the measurement of how far I went up.
[02:27.040 --> 02:27.360]  Got it.
[02:27.920 --> 02:29.020]  We do it again with three.
[02:30.800 --> 02:31.680]  On paper,
[02:32.340 --> 02:34.200]  I should have extended the tape measure
[02:34.200 --> 02:35.720]  three times what I did the first time.
[02:36.120 --> 02:37.640]  I think we're going to need more hands.
[02:38.740 --> 02:41.080]  One, two, three.
[02:41.120 --> 02:41.780]  I got a hand.
[02:42.220 --> 02:42.680]  That's fine.
[02:43.100 --> 02:44.280]  You want to give him a hand, Geoff?
[02:46.000 --> 02:46.440]  Thanks.
[02:49.660 --> 02:50.540]  Holy shit.
[02:50.540 --> 02:51.960]  I need the other end.
[02:52.480 --> 02:53.460]  Do I not?
[02:53.780 --> 02:54.400]  You do.
[02:55.680 --> 02:57.980]  This should be stamped.
[02:58.300 --> 03:00.100]  And that'll be Nick all the way at the bottom.
[03:00.360 --> 03:01.800]  And it'll be the exact same spot.
[03:02.080 --> 03:03.240]  Should we lose the impalers?
[03:03.920 --> 03:05.080]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[03:06.000 --> 03:07.440]  We should probably cut this video.
[03:08.280 --> 03:09.720]  There's so much of this video that's cut.
[03:09.940 --> 03:10.320]  Absolutely.
[03:11.860 --> 03:13.340]  All the tape measures.
[03:13.540 --> 03:16.200]  You know, sometimes...
[03:16.200 --> 03:17.880]  Thank you, Gracie.
[03:17.880 --> 03:19.560]  Okay, we also need a time guide.
[03:20.000 --> 03:21.380]  I have the time right here.
[03:21.540 --> 03:22.700]  I have a clock on the top.
[03:24.300 --> 03:25.540]  Gracie, anything you want to add also?
[03:26.640 --> 03:27.120]  Okay, great.
[03:27.300 --> 03:29.100]  Here we go. I'm going to count you down.
[03:29.280 --> 03:30.160]  We'll go for three seconds.
[03:30.340 --> 03:32.180]  I'm going to let you know when to stop.
[03:32.300 --> 03:32.720]  Okay, Geoff?
[03:35.360 --> 03:37.360]  Three, two, one...
[03:37.360 --> 03:37.700]  Go!
[03:39.880 --> 03:40.240]  Stop.
[03:41.580 --> 03:42.640]  That was three seconds?
[03:44.080 --> 03:44.800]  Two inches.
[03:44.800 --> 03:46.320]  Okay, now put it all the way down.
[03:48.580 --> 03:49.660]  There you go.
[03:51.120 --> 03:52.000]  Now, Gracie.
[03:52.140 --> 03:55.260]  You are going to hold the tape measure and operate the bottom one.
[03:55.520 --> 03:56.980]  Nick, you're going to operate the middle one.
[03:57.240 --> 03:57.940]  Do we have a clipboard?
[03:57.960 --> 03:59.740]  Did anybody write the number down?
[04:00.640 --> 04:01.380]  Two inches.
[04:02.920 --> 04:04.220]  Two inches in three seconds.
[04:04.880 --> 04:07.120]  So we need to go six in three seconds.
[04:07.320 --> 04:07.500]  Yeah.
[04:07.920 --> 04:09.360]  Okay, ready?
[04:10.300 --> 04:12.900]  In three, two, one...
[04:12.900 --> 04:13.680]  Go!
[04:15.180 --> 04:16.240]  Oh, this rules.
[04:16.580 --> 04:18.000]  I'm not moving at all.
[04:18.840 --> 04:20.060]  I wonder if it's too heavy.
[04:20.360 --> 04:21.360]  Mine did not move at all.
[04:21.540 --> 04:22.440]  This is what Gracie said.
[04:22.520 --> 04:23.640]  Anyway, what's the measurement?
[04:25.160 --> 04:27.260]  It's 74 and a quarter.
[04:28.320 --> 04:29.540]  Which is how many inches?
[04:30.700 --> 04:31.860]  68 and a quarter.
[04:33.240 --> 04:34.900]  That was two deaths.
[04:36.100 --> 04:36.880]  Double the speed.
[04:37.060 --> 04:37.640]  Double the speed.
[04:37.880 --> 04:38.740]  We did it!
[04:38.740 --> 04:39.580]  Gracie's thoughts?
[04:40.860 --> 04:41.840]  I get it now.
[04:43.060 --> 04:44.320]  Alright, let's bring him down.
[04:50.800 --> 04:51.800]  You guys!
[04:53.740 --> 04:55.080]  Bring him down.
[04:55.820 --> 04:57.180]  Bring him down safely.
[04:57.380 --> 04:58.740]  Okay, we did it.
[04:59.800 --> 05:00.960]  It's coming home, boys.
[05:01.640 --> 05:02.620]  If you're a desk company
[05:02.620 --> 05:05.260]  who thinks you can do three desks,
[05:05.460 --> 05:06.700]  if you think your motors have it,
[05:06.700 --> 05:07.760]  get in touch
[05:08.800 --> 05:09.760]  at eric...
[05:11.920 --> 05:13.060]  What is it?
[05:13.640 --> 05:14.060]  bits at
[05:14.860 --> 05:15.780]  andrewsemailaddress.net
[05:15.780 --> 05:16.760]  What is it?
[05:18.300 --> 05:20.180]  Fuck these bits, it's...
[05:20.680 --> 05:21.840]  at show.com
[05:23.600 --> 05:25.360]  And we'll take the desks
[05:25.360 --> 05:26.460]  and we'll do it again with three.
[05:27.720 --> 05:28.560]  We should do it with ten.
[05:28.860 --> 05:30.480]  Let's do it with ten. Send ten desks.
[05:30.680 --> 05:32.880]  There's a ten desk company out there, right?
[05:33.060 --> 05:34.520]  A company that's so fucking
[05:36.380 --> 05:36.860]  sure
[05:36.860 --> 05:38.660]  of their desk quality.
[05:38.900 --> 05:40.600]  I have used desks where
[05:40.600 --> 05:42.120]  each leg has its own motor.
[05:42.280 --> 05:43.880]  Instead of this two motor bollocks.
[05:45.420 --> 05:46.320]  Four motors per
[05:46.320 --> 05:48.100]  desk. One per leg.
[05:49.320 --> 05:49.800]  Alright.
[05:50.620 --> 05:51.360]  Final thoughts?
[05:51.960 --> 05:53.880]  I mean, my theory was still right that these weren't gonna fall.
[05:55.540 --> 05:56.020]  Now...
[05:56.020 --> 05:57.400]  Are you gonna flip down?
[05:57.720 --> 05:59.940]  Yeah, I think I should go for some sort of dismount.
[05:59.980 --> 06:00.900]  No, I think we should just cut.
[06:00.900 --> 06:01.560]  Like a somersault?
[06:01.580 --> 06:04.380]  Do you want this for the trial?
[06:04.900 --> 06:06.320]  Or do we need this for the deposition?
[06:06.480 --> 06:08.140]  Alright, everyone wave bye.
