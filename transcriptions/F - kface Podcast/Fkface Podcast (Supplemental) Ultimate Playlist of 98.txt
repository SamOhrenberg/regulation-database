[00:10.210 --> 00:14.150]  Hello and welcome to the music of the summer of 98.
[00:14.390 --> 00:17.610]  This was originally going to be exactly like the movies of 98,
[00:18.070 --> 00:22.750]  but it is really fucking tough to, like, define when music happened.
[00:22.970 --> 00:27.710]  Also, as someone who is, like, 3 for the majority of 98,
[00:28.130 --> 00:30.250]  like, I have no personal point of reference.
[00:30.530 --> 00:35.590]  I originally used the top 100 and, like, what charted there as my reference point,
[00:35.590 --> 00:39.710]  but instead of this being, like, a debate or a ranking,
[00:40.190 --> 00:46.750]  we are going to build a playlist as a collective of all of the music from 98 that we love,
[00:47.030 --> 00:52.450]  and it will be your summer of 98 playlist that you can enjoy reflective of your summer.
[00:52.910 --> 00:56.030]  I'm joined, as always, by Geoff, Eric, and Gavin, and Nick,
[00:56.670 --> 01:00.630]  and I am excited to hear your musical choices because I love music,
[01:00.630 --> 01:02.770]  but it is a massive blind spot for me.
[01:02.770 --> 01:07.190]  I've not nearly invested as much time into music as I have, like, movies or video games.
[01:07.370 --> 01:11.210]  Dude, this is where, like, all the... I'm the opposite.
[01:11.970 --> 01:15.450]  I have invested way more time and effort and love into music
[01:15.450 --> 01:17.650]  than any other entertainment medium in my life,
[01:17.770 --> 01:21.390]  and so I feel like I know infinitely more about it than movies or video games,
[01:21.490 --> 01:22.630]  and I'm so jazzed.
[01:22.730 --> 01:25.010]  I created my own separate list to pull from
[01:25.010 --> 01:28.530]  because I was listening to a very specific kind of music in the time,
[01:28.590 --> 01:31.810]  and I'm largely ignorant to what was going on in the popular culture at the time.
[01:31.810 --> 01:33.010]  I just can't wait to get going.
[01:33.350 --> 01:34.250]  Oh, that's awesome.
[01:34.490 --> 01:36.030]  I am so excited to hear your music.
[01:36.150 --> 01:38.950]  I really like what we're doing with this one.
[01:39.330 --> 01:42.550]  I was worried that after we got done with, like, the debate
[01:42.550 --> 01:44.830]  and sort of ranking of, like, top 10, I'm like,
[01:45.070 --> 01:49.310]  I just can't imagine that my music and Gavin's music is ever going to, like,
[01:50.810 --> 01:53.150]  you know, really, like, meet in the middle.
[01:53.430 --> 01:53.650]  Yeah.
[01:55.250 --> 01:56.350]  It... it's so...
[01:58.050 --> 02:01.210]  98 was a time when I, I mean, I turned 12,
[02:01.330 --> 02:07.830]  and it was when I was really, like, finding music, listening to the radio a lot,
[02:07.870 --> 02:10.410]  and then getting past stuff on the radio a lot,
[02:10.470 --> 02:13.490]  and finding stuff that was like, oh, whoa, I like this.
[02:13.550 --> 02:14.470]  I'm going to listen to that.
[02:14.610 --> 02:21.730]  And it was becoming sentient, you know, in, like, through music, which was very exciting.
[02:21.950 --> 02:24.350]  Yeah, I feel like for me, it was, I was right before that stage.
[02:24.350 --> 02:26.870]  Like, I was still, I didn't have access to my own music yet,
[02:26.910 --> 02:28.530]  or I couldn't change to the radio yet.
[02:28.650 --> 02:32.550]  So I was just, it was whatever my parents listened to in 98 still.
[02:33.410 --> 02:38.870]  Yeah. And I really like the idea of us not having to, like, go crazy here.
[02:39.410 --> 02:42.030]  And make something that's like, okay, we got to, like, rank these.
[02:42.490 --> 02:46.430]  But we're just making a list of songs that we feel like should be on a playlist.
[02:47.150 --> 02:51.190]  Well, and it's also, it's hard to argue a bunch of songs that none of us have ever heard.
[02:51.230 --> 02:51.550]  Totally.
[02:51.710 --> 02:52.690]  For or against, you know?
[02:52.690 --> 02:56.250]  So this is like the ultimate summer of 98 playlist,
[02:56.490 --> 03:00.870]  which is not to say this is music that just came out in the summer of 98,
[03:01.330 --> 03:07.690]  but more like music for your summer of 98, right?
[03:08.810 --> 03:09.990]  Which I'm very into.
[03:10.210 --> 03:13.910]  So we're trying to kind of stay within, like, that 98 range, I think.
[03:14.190 --> 03:16.790]  And that's just kind of where we're at with this stuff.
[03:16.790 --> 03:23.670]  I think, do you want to kind of go one by one and everyone, like,
[03:24.150 --> 03:27.810]  picks a song in order and talks about why they want to pick that song?
[03:28.030 --> 03:29.570]  Yeah, I think that's a great idea.
[03:29.710 --> 03:32.050]  I think maybe, like, when you're out of songs,
[03:32.110 --> 03:33.850]  just say, like, I'm done adding to the list.
[03:33.910 --> 03:37.850]  And then it'll just keep cycling until everyone has killed what they want.
[03:38.230 --> 03:40.890]  Okay, I can make a list.
[03:41.450 --> 03:44.110]  I can kind of, like, jot these down as we go.
[03:44.110 --> 03:47.750]  And I'll share it with you guys if you want to keep an eye on it or whatever.
[03:48.010 --> 03:51.850]  And yeah, you can also sort of edit as we move or whatever.
[03:51.850 --> 03:55.670]  But this will be a playlist that I think we'll put together
[03:55.670 --> 03:58.830]  and share out with everyone when this comes out.
[03:58.830 --> 04:03.010]  So you can sort of shuffle it and listen to it for your ultimate summer of 98 playlist.
[04:03.310 --> 04:05.890]  I'm looking at this document of some of the songs here.
[04:06.050 --> 04:09.330]  I can't believe some of these are from the summer of 98.
[04:09.470 --> 04:12.670]  Like, I would have put money on these being from so much earlier.
[04:12.670 --> 04:14.970]  Yep. So that's like...
[04:14.970 --> 04:16.630]  Ace of Base? Cool summer?
[04:17.150 --> 04:18.890]  That's the one that gets me every single time.
[04:18.890 --> 04:20.130]  I thought that was in the 80s.
[04:20.230 --> 04:20.510]  Me too!
[04:20.530 --> 04:23.690]  Well, Landslide by Fleetwood Mac gets me because that's from, like, 1977.
[04:24.470 --> 04:25.630]  Yeah. Is it re-released?
[04:25.870 --> 04:30.670]  No, no, no. Like, Ace of Base was a 90s band.
[04:31.250 --> 04:32.130]  And, like...
[04:32.130 --> 04:33.350]  When was All That She Wants?
[04:33.910 --> 04:35.470]  That was probably 96.
[04:36.170 --> 04:36.450]  What?
[04:38.290 --> 04:39.270]  You don't think so?
[04:39.390 --> 04:41.270]  All That She Wants, 1992.
[04:42.030 --> 04:44.950]  Oh my god. I thought that was 80s shit.
[04:45.010 --> 04:48.010]  No, no, no, no, no. They were hard 90s.
[04:48.030 --> 04:52.190]  Weren't they a... What's the fucking Euro-trat? What's the thing?
[04:52.270 --> 04:52.790]  Eurovision?
[04:53.170 --> 04:55.070]  Eurovision. Aren't they a Eurovision band?
[04:55.610 --> 04:55.950]  I don't know.
[04:55.970 --> 05:00.430]  Are they? That would be so weird because they were pinned as the next ABBA.
[05:00.610 --> 05:02.190]  And ABBA was a Eurovision band, right?
[05:02.390 --> 05:05.030]  Ace of Base, Swedish pop group, formed in 1990.
[05:06.130 --> 05:09.250]  Jesus. That's blowing my penis out.
[05:09.250 --> 05:11.770]  Does not... I don't think that they're Eurovision.
[05:11.770 --> 05:12.050]  Medic!
[05:16.030 --> 05:19.290]  Anyway, hey, what order do we want to go in? Do we want to do Anneg?
[05:20.370 --> 05:21.250]  Yeah, let's do Anneg.
[05:21.350 --> 05:22.370]  Yeah, hey, we can do Anneg.
[05:23.050 --> 05:24.270]  So, what? That means I'm first?
[05:24.630 --> 05:25.570]  That's your first, Andrew.
[05:25.750 --> 05:25.930]  Yeah.
[05:26.010 --> 05:32.850]  Okay, I'm gonna go... This is, like, very basic for its time. It's on the top 100 list that charted.
[05:33.090 --> 05:38.430]  I'm gonna go with Stop by the Spice Girls. I fucking loved the Spice Girls as a kid.
[05:38.430 --> 05:41.590]  It's such fun music. The movie was great.
[05:42.510 --> 05:45.430]  Might be on a future list, depending on the content we do.
[05:46.090 --> 05:48.570]  I just... I think they're such a fun pop group.
[05:48.970 --> 05:54.350]  And they were a very major part of my childhood as far as, like, music listening, I guess.
[05:54.510 --> 05:56.450]  Did you think Stop was a good song in itself?
[05:56.890 --> 05:59.430]  I think Stop is a great song. I think it's one of their top songs.
[05:59.830 --> 06:00.570]  Thank you very much.
[06:03.090 --> 06:07.470]  I totally agree with you, Andrew. I feel like this was right at the end of
[06:08.010 --> 06:11.370]  Girl Power and Spice Girls stuff and everything.
[06:11.590 --> 06:15.010]  But I think this is probably their... I think this is probably their best song.
[06:15.570 --> 06:18.790]  It's up there for sure. Yeah, definitely top two, I'd say.
[06:19.230 --> 06:19.470]  Yeah.
[06:19.850 --> 06:21.150]  And that is my first selection.
[06:21.710 --> 06:22.350]  Okay, Nick?
[06:22.870 --> 06:26.930]  You know, Gavin was talking earlier about how he was kind of at the mercy of his folks still.
[06:27.210 --> 06:30.450]  And that's kind of where I was at. I was about 10 in 98.
[06:30.710 --> 06:33.930]  And so I didn't quite have my own feel for music yet.
[06:33.930 --> 06:37.550]  And, you know, sometimes you just get those earworms that would never grow away.
[06:37.650 --> 06:45.010]  And I think Tub Thumping by Chumbawumba really is one of those songs that even now,
[06:45.070 --> 06:46.490]  when you still hear it, you're like, you'll find yourself...
[06:49.130 --> 06:52.470]  It's one of those songs too, that if you don't know it well enough,
[06:52.510 --> 06:53.950]  you end up in a chorus loop.
[07:01.250 --> 07:04.450]  Yeah, if you don't get into Danny Boy, then you're just stuck.
[07:05.790 --> 07:07.930]  But I always remember Pissing the Night Away.
[07:08.350 --> 07:10.910]  Are you familiar with that band at all?
[07:11.110 --> 07:12.030]  No, not even a little.
[07:12.030 --> 07:13.170]  Do you know anything about Chumbawumba?
[07:14.550 --> 07:15.970]  Interesting history of that band.
[07:16.490 --> 07:18.370]  They're like an anarchist punk band.
[07:18.750 --> 07:18.950]  What?
[07:19.230 --> 07:22.410]  Yeah, they came from a band called Conflict.
[07:22.410 --> 07:24.330]  It was members from a band called Conflict.
[07:26.050 --> 07:27.150]  They took a turn.
[07:27.310 --> 07:28.510]  That seems crazy.
[07:29.270 --> 07:30.930]  It was a weird deal.
[07:31.050 --> 07:34.470]  I think they were setting out to create a pop.
[07:34.710 --> 07:35.470]  I think they were just...
[07:35.470 --> 07:36.410]  Do you know why they did it?
[07:36.510 --> 07:37.350]  I remember there's a reason.
[07:37.430 --> 07:40.110]  They were either trying to get rich, or they were trying to be clever or something.
[07:40.470 --> 07:41.230]  I'm sure it was both.
[07:42.110 --> 07:46.430]  You gotta have something to fund your Marxism, I suppose.
[07:48.750 --> 07:49.290]  Here's a pop hit.
[07:49.290 --> 07:49.710]  Keep the lights on.
[07:50.330 --> 07:52.110]  Yeah, I mean, so there's that.
[07:53.270 --> 07:55.070]  Okay, I think that's a great one.
[07:55.190 --> 07:58.090]  My pick is...
[07:58.770 --> 08:07.310]  This is not necessarily the type of music that I was listening to a lot of in 1998,
[08:07.710 --> 08:13.310]  but I think this is probably one of my favorite songs now.
[08:13.890 --> 08:16.770]  And it's Nobody Does It Better by Nate Dogg.
[08:16.850 --> 08:17.610]  RIP Nate Dogg.
[08:17.610 --> 08:18.710]  Oh, it's so good.
[08:18.710 --> 08:23.970]  I think Nate Dogg was underrated in everything that he did.
[08:24.210 --> 08:24.650]  Rest in peace.
[08:25.050 --> 08:26.290]  Nate Dogg fucking rules.
[08:26.990 --> 08:29.310]  I love that song.
[08:29.630 --> 08:32.830]  I think that absolutely belongs on this playlist.
[08:33.250 --> 08:33.530]  Love it.
[08:33.930 --> 08:34.550]  100%.
[08:34.550 --> 08:34.750]  Yeah.
[08:35.230 --> 08:36.070]  It's so good.
[08:36.730 --> 08:40.250]  I bought the entire... it's not a... I don't think a 98 song.
[08:40.550 --> 08:45.890]  I bought the entire The Transporter movie soundtrack because of a Nate Dogg song.
[08:46.190 --> 08:47.110]  It was fantastic.
[08:47.230 --> 08:47.470]  Oh, yeah?
[08:47.470 --> 08:48.070]  Yeah.
[08:48.210 --> 08:50.190]  I don't remember what the song title is.
[08:50.290 --> 08:53.790]  It's like, I got game because the game was given to me.
[08:54.430 --> 08:56.830]  Love for the ghetto, down for whatever.
[08:57.270 --> 08:58.390]  I don't remember anything else.
[08:58.670 --> 09:00.110]  I would play that on loop.
[09:00.110 --> 09:00.710]  That's enough.
[09:03.350 --> 09:04.650]  It's called I Got Love.
[09:05.950 --> 09:06.390]  Fantastic.
[09:06.970 --> 09:07.110]  Yeah.
[09:07.510 --> 09:15.970]  I like Nate Dogg because his logo also is like this rabbit that wears a hat.
[09:15.970 --> 09:17.630]  And it's like G-ed out.
[09:18.090 --> 09:21.410]  I love the G-funk rabbit.
[09:21.890 --> 09:22.610]  Thank you, Nate Dogg.
[09:23.850 --> 09:26.110]  Now, are we doing Geoff or are we doing Gavin?
[09:26.570 --> 09:27.750]  How does an egg go?
[09:28.210 --> 09:28.850]  I don't remember.
[09:29.150 --> 09:30.650]  Yeah, I don't know which G I am in the egg.
[09:30.650 --> 09:31.850]  I think it goes Geoff Gavin.
[09:32.150 --> 09:32.970]  I think it goes Geoff Gavin.
[09:33.410 --> 09:33.810]  Sounds good.
[09:34.290 --> 09:35.350]  I guess I'm up then.
[09:35.730 --> 09:38.610]  Okay, so the first song I'm picking...
[09:38.610 --> 09:40.210]  Eric, I guess you're writing these down or something.
[09:40.350 --> 09:41.070]  I am.
[09:41.270 --> 09:45.530]  I'm keeping a copy of them right here in the link I'm sending.
[09:45.530 --> 09:50.030]  Just so you know, I sent a link to my Punk Summer of 98 playlist that I created there,
[09:50.190 --> 09:51.650]  so you can find the songs there.
[09:51.770 --> 09:53.330]  There's going to be... we won't get to all those songs, obviously.
[09:53.450 --> 09:53.590]  Okay.
[09:54.350 --> 09:58.730]  The first song I'm going to pick is from one of my favorite bands of all time.
[09:59.250 --> 10:01.230]  This is back summer of 1998.
[10:01.310 --> 10:03.210]  I was 22, 23 years old.
[10:03.470 --> 10:07.270]  This is when I was as obnoxiously into punk as humanly possible.
[10:07.390 --> 10:13.910]  From about 15 until like maybe 28 or 29, I was militant and annoying about it.
[10:13.910 --> 10:20.110]  I ignored all other forms of music to my own detriment.
[10:20.730 --> 10:21.890]  I have learned later in life.
[10:21.990 --> 10:24.790]  I really wish that I hadn't been such a little prick about it all.
[10:25.650 --> 10:30.310]  But luckily, 1998 was one of the best years of punk music in my lifetime.
[10:30.930 --> 10:35.050]  So the first song I'm picking is Five Lessons Learned by The Swingin' Utters.
[10:35.390 --> 10:35.630]  Nice.
[10:35.930 --> 10:38.290]  From their album, Five Lessons Learned.
[10:38.430 --> 10:41.610]  It is a fucking banger from start to finish.
[10:41.610 --> 10:44.290]  Might be the best song that you'll hear on this whole playlist.
[10:45.070 --> 10:48.770]  Interesting thing about Swingin' Utters, they're from California.
[10:48.910 --> 10:49.610]  They're from San Francisco.
[10:50.490 --> 10:53.690]  The band used to be called Johnny P. Bucks and The Swingin' Utters,
[10:53.790 --> 10:57.190]  but they truncated that name because Swingin' Utters is cooler.
[10:57.430 --> 10:59.790]  And the reason they came up with that name is because the lead singer,
[10:59.890 --> 11:03.070]  Johnny Bunnell, who I interviewed one time for one of my punk scenes,
[11:03.510 --> 11:05.610]  one night in San Francisco when they were hanging out
[11:06.170 --> 11:09.950]  after a show before they were in the band, he got really drunk and pissed himself.
[11:09.950 --> 11:11.850]  And then they went to Taco Bell.
[11:12.050 --> 11:14.850]  And when he pulled his money out, his money was covered in his piss.
[11:14.970 --> 11:17.170]  And he had to pay for the Taco Bell with piss-covered money.
[11:17.650 --> 11:19.990]  So they gave him the nickname Johnny P. Bucks.
[11:20.590 --> 11:22.110]  And then they started the band.
[11:22.670 --> 11:25.090]  There you go. Five Lessons Learned by The Swingin' Utters.
[11:25.370 --> 11:28.070]  Fantastic song. Entire album is a banger.
[11:28.350 --> 11:29.270]  But that's the best song on it.
[11:29.650 --> 11:29.810]  Wow.
[11:29.810 --> 11:31.350]  That's good. I like that.
[11:31.730 --> 11:32.050]  Gavin?
[11:32.710 --> 11:36.270]  For me, Summer of 98 was ruled by Fatboy Slim.
[11:37.010 --> 11:41.770]  It was probably my first introduction to music that had samples of other people's music.
[11:42.370 --> 11:44.670]  I was, I assume, very late to that.
[11:45.170 --> 11:47.350]  So Rockefeller Skank, Fatboy Slim.
[11:49.090 --> 11:50.130]  What a song.
[11:50.130 --> 11:50.990]  I think that's a good pick.
[11:51.470 --> 11:52.290]  Yeah, it's a great pick.
[11:52.470 --> 11:54.550]  Very 98. Right up there now.
[11:55.430 --> 12:00.630]  Yeah. So my relationship with Rockefeller Skank is it was one of the, like,
[12:00.930 --> 12:04.610]  title tracks to a FIFA game I had on the PS1.
[12:04.610 --> 12:08.210]  And it was my favorite song on that game.
[12:08.270 --> 12:13.550]  And as part of this exercise of, like, listening to the top 100 listed songs that's on there,
[12:14.030 --> 12:14.710]  I listened to it.
[12:14.810 --> 12:18.090]  I've had the lyrics wrong my entire life.
[12:18.290 --> 12:19.650]  My entire life.
[12:19.690 --> 12:24.710]  I thought the lyrics were, right about now, The Funk So Rubber.
[12:25.010 --> 12:28.790]  And that has been what I thought up until, like, two weeks ago,
[12:28.930 --> 12:32.050]  when I re-listened to this and learned it's Funk Soul Brother.
[12:32.470 --> 12:33.070]  Funk Soul Brother.
[12:33.070 --> 12:34.930]  The Funk So Rubber?
[12:35.150 --> 12:38.850]  I thought it was The Funk So Rubber. Right about now.
[12:38.850 --> 12:41.430]  If you've ever listened to the original sample of that, it's just,
[12:41.610 --> 12:44.050]  it's just like some guy introing his track.
[12:44.350 --> 12:47.490]  I don't know how he ever found that and thought that would make a great sample.
[12:47.630 --> 12:51.150]  It's so obscure. It might be one of his most obscure samples of all time.
[12:51.870 --> 12:54.630]  That's awesome. It's a good one. I like it.
[12:55.610 --> 12:56.770]  Come back around, Andrew.
[12:57.310 --> 13:02.270]  I'm going for another. This is, I have no other points of reference for this person's music.
[13:03.070 --> 13:09.870]  But as part of the discovery of this process, I listened to Paper by Queen Latifah for the first
[13:09.870 --> 13:17.270]  time. And that song is a fucking banger. That's a great song. It's essentially a do-over of Heard
[13:17.270 --> 13:21.350]  It Through The Grapevine. Like, it takes all of it, but there's some lyrical changes to it.
[13:21.670 --> 13:25.510]  Just a fucking banger of a song. Like, really liked it. Really enjoyed it.
[13:25.570 --> 13:30.470]  Charted in the summer of 98. Not that that's important, but it made me want to explore Queen
[13:30.470 --> 13:35.730]  Latifah's music, which is something that I have never had any interest in checking out. Just not
[13:35.730 --> 13:41.170]  on my radar. I wonder if she's underrated as a musician. Huh. Yeah, I don't know if I'm just
[13:41.170 --> 13:45.950]  out of the scene. I feel like she's not rated at all at this point, but like, I'm pretty disconnected.
[13:47.270 --> 13:52.670]  So, yeah, I was really impressed by that song. And I enjoyed it way more than I assumed I would
[13:52.670 --> 13:59.830]  going into it. Okay, I like it. Nick? So, this is a song that I feel like was everywhere. And again,
[13:59.830 --> 14:04.250]  you could just flip through the radio and find it on whatever pop station or whatever it was playing
[14:04.250 --> 14:09.370]  on. And it's also been featured in a lot of car ads over the years. So, anytime it pops back up,
[14:09.410 --> 14:14.750]  it's going to be on your mind again. And, you know, it's also one of those meme-ified songs. So,
[14:15.290 --> 14:22.850]  it's been one week by Bare Naked Ladies. From our dear friends, the Bare Naked Ladies.
[14:23.250 --> 14:25.810]  That's very funny. Chickadee China.
[14:28.350 --> 14:36.890]  That's a good one, though. That's a very good pick. Because, man, again, inescapable, right?
[14:38.090 --> 14:41.850]  That song just makes you stand up. Like, if I'm lounging around, I hear that. I'm just like,
[14:41.850 --> 14:46.150]  ah, here we go. I'm just getting up to be a part of that. I love it.
[14:46.550 --> 14:50.910]  Man, that is a song in a band that's very near and dear to Rooster Teeth and their history.
[14:51.130 --> 14:53.190]  That's a great choice. Captain Dynamic.
[14:53.930 --> 15:01.070]  Yeah, Captain Flowers. The only dude I know who's crashed a plane and walked away from it.
[15:01.750 --> 15:02.790]  That's awesome.
[15:03.210 --> 15:10.030]  He once sung my name into one of his songs, and it's still probably the coolest thing that's
[15:10.030 --> 15:11.910]  ever happened to me in my life. Oh, absolutely.
[15:12.930 --> 15:22.470]  Let's see. So, I go next. Really different from my first pick, but this was very...
[15:23.710 --> 15:27.030]  instrumental in what music I would listen to for the next...
[15:28.970 --> 15:37.430]  10 years? Whatever. San Francisco by Alkaline Trio. Alkaline Trio, a punk band that had an
[15:37.430 --> 15:42.690]  album in 1998 called God Damn It that I listened to... Is their best album.
[15:43.270 --> 15:50.790]  Endlessly. I mean, just, if you could wear a hole in a CD, it would be this. It was half an
[15:50.790 --> 15:55.730]  hour long. The album is half an hour long, and it would end, and I would just go play it again.
[15:56.950 --> 15:57.950]  Doesn't matter. Yeah.
[15:58.050 --> 16:00.750]  Eric, I have three songs from that album on my playlist.
[16:01.950 --> 16:02.730]  Yeah, I do.
[16:02.990 --> 16:04.190]  What songs did you pick?
[16:04.390 --> 16:13.670]  I threw Cringe, Clavicle, and my personal favorite, Where Did It Go? Sorry about that.
[16:13.830 --> 16:14.590]  The last song on the album.
[16:14.810 --> 16:20.350]  Great. All great songs. I wanted something that would fit in a playlist that was a little more
[16:20.350 --> 16:25.290]  up. So, I think San Francisco really fits. Clavicle, I think, is one of my favorite songs
[16:25.290 --> 16:33.390]  by that band. If you don't know Alkaline Trio, and you're older now, you probably don't need
[16:33.390 --> 16:37.390]  to go back and listen to it. I think you're gonna be like, oh, this sounds a little bit dated.
[16:37.830 --> 16:44.310]  And it does. But just know that when Blink-182 needed someone to fill in,
[16:44.310 --> 16:50.210]  and they went with Matt Skiba, it is like all of my worlds colliding in one band.
[16:50.430 --> 16:54.590]  If I could have been 12 and seeing that, I would have lost my fucking mind.
[16:54.950 --> 16:56.730]  It was pretty insane. It was pretty insane.
[16:57.230 --> 16:58.090]  Magic. Really, really magic.
[16:58.110 --> 17:02.790]  Matt Skiba is such a phenomenal singer. Such an interesting dude. Him and Dan Adriano,
[17:02.870 --> 17:04.810]  the other guy, that sings in Alkaline Trio as well.
[17:05.010 --> 17:11.590]  Great, great stuff. Alkaline Trio, goddammit, is still one that I hold very near and dear.
[17:11.990 --> 17:13.170]  So, that's my pick.
[17:13.890 --> 17:16.850]  Okay, so that's Eric. Is it my turn now?
[17:17.130 --> 17:17.790]  Yeah, yeah, now it's your turn.
[17:17.790 --> 17:20.470]  Alright, I have a bunch of Alkaline Trio stuff I want to add to that,
[17:20.530 --> 17:22.230]  but I'll just wait until I pull them up.
[17:22.550 --> 17:22.710]  Got it.
[17:23.050 --> 17:30.010]  The next song I'm gonna go with is... it's up there for the second best song on my playlist here.
[17:31.130 --> 17:35.670]  It's one of those songs that every time you hear it, you start dancing and you start moving,
[17:35.990 --> 17:42.830]  no matter where you are. It's a song by a band, a hardcore band out of Virginia called Avail.
[17:43.170 --> 17:49.150]  Who is a very, very, very beloved and respected band. And this was their biggest album to date,
[17:49.230 --> 17:53.630]  it was their most melodic album to date, and it's called Over the James. And the song they
[17:53.630 --> 17:57.730]  released was called Deepwood. And if you listen to it, it'll be stuck in your head for the rest
[17:57.730 --> 18:02.070]  of your fucking life. It is a phenomenal ass-kicking song. And one of the things that I
[18:02.070 --> 18:05.850]  always liked, I thought that was interesting about Avail, because I'm going to give you a
[18:05.850 --> 18:09.590]  little factoid about each band or whatever, as long as I have one. They're from Virginia,
[18:09.590 --> 18:16.990]  I was from Alabama. I grew up hating being from Alabama. Hating being an Alabamian, you know that,
[18:17.050 --> 18:20.510]  I make fun of it all the time, I hate it, I got out of there as soon as I could. And I was always
[18:20.510 --> 18:23.670]  bummed about that. I looked at other people that were proud of where they were from, and I always
[18:23.670 --> 18:27.650]  kind of hated being from the South. I joined the Army, being from the South, and the Army was not
[18:27.650 --> 18:35.590]  a cool thing. I got shit on a lot for it, especially in the 90s. And so I really tried my
[18:35.590 --> 18:41.730]  best early on to try to eschew the Southern part out of me. Then I discovered Avail, and they are
[18:41.730 --> 18:47.090]  so militantly proud of being from Virginia and being from the South, that it made me look at
[18:47.090 --> 18:51.250]  Alabama in a totally different way. And I thought, if they can be proud of Virginia and be proud of
[18:51.250 --> 18:55.490]  where they're from, I can find stuff about Alabama that I like, that I can be proud of too. It's okay
[18:55.490 --> 19:01.390]  to be some dumb redneck from the South. And so I tried, and it turns out there's nothing there.
[19:01.390 --> 19:06.370]  I couldn't find anything. But I appreciate that they're happy about being from Virginia.
[19:06.770 --> 19:13.090]  I really, they emboldened me to find that in Alabama, and it just wasn't there. But I tried.
[19:13.510 --> 19:19.690]  Great pick. I think, very cool. Like, Geoff, if this is for no one else, you're really,
[19:19.810 --> 19:23.650]  you're scratching an itch for me when you're throwing this stuff out there.
[19:24.090 --> 19:27.150]  Yeah, I really appreciate this information, as somebody who doesn't,
[19:27.490 --> 19:29.090]  like, just a different era of music for me.
[19:29.090 --> 19:29.730]  Yeah, sure.
[19:29.950 --> 19:31.670]  Definitely. Gavin?
[19:32.270 --> 19:37.650]  This one isn't on this list, but I remember it being all over the radio. It is this,
[19:39.010 --> 19:46.210]  called Feel It, which was based on Can You Feel It by Jackson 5. It was that song mixed with some
[19:46.210 --> 19:53.130]  other song. So it's just basically the main melody of the Jackson 5 song, with the lyrics,
[19:53.750 --> 19:56.190]  what's she gonna look like with a chimney on her?
[19:57.130 --> 20:01.050]  And I always remember thinking, like, what does that mean? It just, it just repeats.
[20:01.450 --> 20:04.990]  Firstly, it just takes ages for the drop to happen. And then it just repeats,
[20:05.190 --> 20:08.950]  what's she gonna look like with a chimney on her? So I looked up where that sample's from.
[20:09.350 --> 20:15.510]  Apparently, it's from another song, where one of the lyrics is, wanna drop a house on that bitch.
[20:17.890 --> 20:21.650]  So I guess they want to find out what some woman would look like with a chimney on her.
[20:21.650 --> 20:23.230]  This is the song with the bells.
[20:23.530 --> 20:24.590]  It's the bells, yeah.
[20:24.770 --> 20:30.410]  This is the song with the bells in it. I looked it up, and it's that, it's dun, dun, dun.
[20:30.510 --> 20:30.630]  Yeah.
[20:30.930 --> 20:35.850]  Dun, dun, dun. Those bells that, like, oh man, I remember this.
[20:35.990 --> 20:40.290]  Yeah, just endlessly looping. But all the, I mean, those bells in the, the Jackson song.
[20:40.330 --> 20:46.430]  Yeah. Wow, man. Innocent. Yep, that was, that was an everywhere one. That's fun.
[20:47.650 --> 20:50.250]  That was good, good pick. Andrew, back to you.
[20:50.250 --> 20:53.830]  Going with a classic from one of my favorite, uh, groups.
[20:54.490 --> 20:57.970]  Intergalactic by the Beastie Boys. Nice. Great pick. Fantastic song.
[20:58.890 --> 21:02.830]  Like, whenever you hear it, like, it just, it, it pumps me up. It's a great song.
[21:03.230 --> 21:06.570]  The video is awesome for it. Like, there's so many great,
[21:06.930 --> 21:11.150]  just Beastie Boy videos in general. Like, what a classic group, what a great song.
[21:11.690 --> 21:15.250]  That's, that's Hello Nasty? Is that that album?
[21:15.530 --> 21:19.410]  No, it's, uh, Intergalactic, I think it's on, uh,
[21:20.250 --> 21:23.110]  no, is it Hello Nasty? I gotta look it up now.
[21:24.270 --> 21:27.270]  Uh, yes, it is. It is. Okay. Yes, it's on, uh, Hello Nasty.
[21:27.410 --> 21:30.530]  Hello Nasty is a big-ass album. Do you know where they got the name
[21:30.530 --> 21:32.110]  Hello Nasty from? No. No.
[21:32.810 --> 21:40.150]  So they owned a, I don't know if they still do, but they, uh, they owned a clothing shop
[21:40.150 --> 21:43.910]  in New York City for a while, in one of the boroughs, and it was like, uh, it was back when,
[21:44.050 --> 21:49.750]  uh, when, uh, like, people were really, really first starting to get into, um,
[21:51.030 --> 21:55.190]  monetizing shit from Goodwill and, like, thrifting and vintage was starting to come up in, like,
[21:55.270 --> 21:59.770]  in, like, the young culture. And so they had, uh, a store, and I think it was called Nasty,
[21:59.890 --> 22:05.190]  or maybe that was the address, but anyway, they, uh, there was, anytime the phone would ring,
[22:05.270 --> 22:08.450]  the girl behind the counter, she would answer, Hello Nasty, and they thought that was really
[22:08.450 --> 22:10.470]  funny. That's how they answered the phone. I had no idea.
[22:10.650 --> 22:12.350]  And so they named the album that, yeah. That rules.
[22:13.110 --> 22:17.290]  If, if this is on the list, then, like, the song that I would pick from this album would
[22:17.290 --> 22:20.190]  be Body Movin'. I think Body Movin' is so good.
[22:20.190 --> 22:20.870]  Great song.
[22:21.150 --> 22:23.030]  Also, 3M Season 1 DJ.
[22:23.850 --> 22:28.930]  Incredible. Both incredible songs that are on Hello Nasty also, but I think Intergalactic
[22:28.930 --> 22:32.650]  is definitely the strongest pick in the whole thing.
[22:34.030 --> 22:38.090]  Not Intergalactic specific, but just, like, a thing for people to check out the Beastie Boys.
[22:38.470 --> 22:41.550]  Watch their live performance of Check It Out.
[22:41.870 --> 22:42.170]  Oh, yeah.
[22:42.210 --> 22:46.510]  On Letterman. So fucking cool. It's, like, a one-shot where they start from the New York
[22:46.510 --> 22:50.430]  subway and then walk to Letterman and then continue the performance live.
[22:50.430 --> 22:51.170]  Oh, no way. Yeah, that sounds great.
[22:51.210 --> 22:51.530]  Oh, it's awesome.
[22:51.730 --> 22:52.430]  It's fucking awesome.
[22:52.830 --> 22:57.830]  Yep. If you, if you can, if you're also, if you're looking that up, you should look up
[22:57.830 --> 23:04.490]  the music video for 3M Season 1 DJ, because the whole first, before the song starts at
[23:04.490 --> 23:10.670]  one minute and 40 seconds in or whatever, it is the Beastie Boys holding a pose downstairs
[23:10.670 --> 23:15.450]  and just a camera walking to get to them, and then the music video starts.
[23:15.450 --> 23:19.710]  It is a minute and a half of nothing. It's fantastic. It's so cool.
[23:20.150 --> 23:24.370]  And then after you do that, listen to the entire album, Paul's Boutique.
[23:24.590 --> 23:28.750]  It is the most overlooked Beastie Boys album because it was their follow-up to License
[23:28.750 --> 23:32.310]  to Ill, and it was before, it came in before Check Your Head, which was another huge one.
[23:32.390 --> 23:37.190]  It was kind of in a weird place, but it is one of the most, it is, it, it couldn't be
[23:37.190 --> 23:40.370]  made today because they sampled more music. It was like a Girl Talk album.
[23:40.570 --> 23:40.690]  Yeah.
[23:40.830 --> 23:43.970]  They sampled so much music in there before sampling became an issue.
[23:43.970 --> 23:47.910]  And so they literally couldn't make the songs today. The licensing would be insane,
[23:48.010 --> 23:53.510]  but it is a brilliant, brilliant album from start to finish, and it doesn't get enough respect.
[23:53.690 --> 23:56.910]  It's really good. It's produced by the Dust Brothers.
[23:57.330 --> 23:57.450]  Yeah.
[23:57.450 --> 24:06.050]  And it has so many samples and so many different songs, and what a cool thing from a band
[24:06.050 --> 24:08.950]  that didn't want to be rappers but wanted to be a hardcore band.
[24:09.250 --> 24:09.430]  Yeah.
[24:09.430 --> 24:10.110]  Sure.
[24:11.110 --> 24:15.170]  Fucking, uh, uh, Shake Your Rump, best Beastie Boys song ever.
[24:15.990 --> 24:17.130]  That's such a great song.
[24:17.250 --> 24:18.210]  It's such a great song.
[24:18.630 --> 24:22.890]  It's, you listen to it now. It is just fun for every, just all the way through. You
[24:22.890 --> 24:24.350]  can't stop smiling when you listen to it.
[24:24.370 --> 24:27.850]  It's very, very good. Uh, great pick, Andrew. Uh, Nick.
[24:28.330 --> 24:32.730]  You know, this is another one of those songs that I feel like gets stuck in your head,
[24:32.790 --> 24:37.330]  but this is also one that it sneaks past you when you're younger. Like I said,
[24:37.330 --> 24:41.730]  I was about 10 when this came out, and I don't know even into my teenage years that I caught
[24:42.390 --> 24:47.250]  kind of the filthiness of the song, Semi-Charmed Life by Third Eye Blind.
[24:47.250 --> 24:47.650]  Oh, yeah.
[24:48.930 --> 24:51.770]  In fact, I was talking to my wife the other day, and she was like,
[24:51.830 --> 24:56.150]  did you know what that song's about? And I said no, and then she like read the lyrics to me.
[24:56.650 --> 24:58.790]  I was just reading through them. One of them is like,
[24:59.290 --> 25:01.850]  Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break.
[25:02.070 --> 25:06.610]  Yeah. And there's a whole line about like when she comes over and is going down on him.
[25:06.610 --> 25:11.930]  It's like, what? That's in a pop song from when I was 10, and I loved it.
[25:12.110 --> 25:12.750]  What's wrong with me?
[25:15.610 --> 25:19.070]  Semi-Charmed Life, great song. Great 90s pop song.
[25:19.090 --> 25:19.430]  I love that song.
[25:19.950 --> 25:25.750]  You are taking a pick away from me because I was absolutely going to go with,
[25:26.710 --> 25:29.950]  man, there's so many choices on that album.
[25:30.050 --> 25:30.350]  Oh, yeah.
[25:30.350 --> 25:35.050]  Burning Man, London, Motorcycle Drive-By, God of Wine, How's It Gonna Be?
[25:35.770 --> 25:39.750]  That's probably one of my favorite 90s albums.
[25:41.130 --> 25:47.390]  It is probably, I think, probably one of the best produced albums in the 90s.
[25:47.450 --> 25:55.370]  To get that performance out of that band that had such a volatile singer-songwriter
[25:55.370 --> 25:57.950]  who like really couldn't get anything else.
[25:58.110 --> 26:02.010]  Well, they had like another album, but like, I think like one or two singles off of it.
[26:02.010 --> 26:08.710]  To have the success that that album had, that kind of production and that kind of maestro
[26:08.710 --> 26:14.270]  that it takes to get something like that out of that band is, I think, really unrecognized.
[26:14.510 --> 26:21.550]  And if you can put that album on front to back, but if you can find a physical copy of it,
[26:21.770 --> 26:29.170]  because the copy that you get on iTunes or Spotify or whatever is a remixed version
[26:29.170 --> 26:31.830]  and not the original version that you would hear.
[26:31.990 --> 26:32.970]  I hate it.
[26:33.430 --> 26:39.530]  It is, there are changes to Graduate that I don't like.
[26:39.670 --> 26:41.810]  There are changes to so many of the songs.
[26:42.690 --> 26:45.250]  Like Losing a Whole Year sounds different and it's really a bummer.
[26:45.470 --> 26:46.870]  It's really, really, really a bummer.
[26:47.610 --> 26:48.850]  But good, excellent pick.
[26:49.110 --> 26:50.930]  Excellent, excellent, excellent pick, Nick.
[26:51.150 --> 26:51.970]  I love it.
[26:52.210 --> 26:53.050]  It was a good year, man.
[26:53.630 --> 26:54.590]  Yeah, it was.
[26:54.690 --> 26:55.210]  Great song.
[26:55.310 --> 26:58.690]  Maybe, I don't know if it's the number one song about doing crystal meth,
[26:58.690 --> 27:00.430]  but it might be up there.
[27:04.910 --> 27:05.850]  Draft idea.
[27:06.570 --> 27:14.110]  Yeah, my pick is Ghetto Superstar by Proz.
[27:14.230 --> 27:15.810]  Oh, so good.
[27:17.370 --> 27:19.230]  It is a, it's a great song.
[27:20.050 --> 27:22.370]  Maya has a great feature on it.
[27:22.830 --> 27:25.210]  I think Proz is the weakest part of the song.
[27:25.210 --> 27:27.590]  I think the best part of the song is ODB.
[27:28.010 --> 27:32.430]  And if you don't know the story behind the song, this makes it even better.
[27:33.030 --> 27:35.070]  ODB is not supposed to be on that track.
[27:35.490 --> 27:37.670]  This is for the Bullworth soundtrack.
[27:38.330 --> 27:40.170]  It is on Proz's...
[27:41.010 --> 27:41.930]  This is Proz.
[27:42.010 --> 27:42.870]  He is putting this out.
[27:42.970 --> 27:44.170]  Proz is from the Fugees.
[27:44.570 --> 27:45.890]  This is his solo effort.
[27:46.350 --> 27:47.530]  He's doing the song with Maya.
[27:48.030 --> 27:52.430]  ODB is supposed to be recording stuff for RZA in New York.
[27:52.990 --> 27:58.030]  But he happens to be in LA and walks into the studio.
[27:58.810 --> 27:59.970]  He hears the beat.
[28:00.410 --> 28:01.230]  He's fucked up.
[28:01.350 --> 28:02.650]  They don't know what he's on.
[28:02.750 --> 28:03.150]  He's drunk.
[28:03.230 --> 28:03.710]  He's something.
[28:04.010 --> 28:05.790]  He hears the beat and he likes it.
[28:05.830 --> 28:07.430]  And they go, do you want to just be on this?
[28:07.630 --> 28:11.090]  So he just steps up and lays down his verse.
[28:11.530 --> 28:13.310]  It fucking rules.
[28:13.970 --> 28:15.810]  That song is a massive hit.
[28:16.170 --> 28:18.490]  And then ODB is everywhere.
[28:19.430 --> 28:21.030]  Everywhere in that time.
[28:21.030 --> 28:25.690]  I love Old Dirty Bastard so fucking much.
[28:26.030 --> 28:27.990]  He is the coolest.
[28:28.650 --> 28:31.050]  He has given us so many moments.
[28:31.590 --> 28:35.830]  But I need to share this with you, if I can.
[28:37.490 --> 28:39.670]  This is ODB...
[28:40.390 --> 28:41.630]  Let me share my screen.
[28:42.830 --> 28:46.270]  We won't be able to put this in the video.
[28:46.870 --> 28:49.610]  But I do want you guys to be able to see and hear this.
[28:50.390 --> 28:53.910]  Because this is on the end of them promoting this song.
[28:54.030 --> 28:55.630]  And this is from MTV 1998.
[28:56.170 --> 28:56.690]  Okay.
[28:57.130 --> 28:57.650]  Here it is.
[29:07.370 --> 29:08.470]  That's so good.
[29:09.630 --> 29:09.970]  Wow.
[29:09.990 --> 29:11.850]  What are you going to do to give back to the community?
[29:12.130 --> 29:13.870]  Points to himself, nothing.
[29:14.730 --> 29:17.450]  It is such a tragedy that that dude died.
[29:17.630 --> 29:19.130]  ODB is the greatest of all time.
[29:19.130 --> 29:25.510]  To put a bow on this, Praz was found guilty of 10 counts of criminal conspiracy.
[29:26.150 --> 29:26.890]  Oh my god.
[29:27.470 --> 29:30.610]  Criminal conspiracy and campaign finance charges.
[29:32.930 --> 29:37.710]  If you ever want to go down the ODB rabbit hole, he had some phenomenal Howard Stern
[29:37.710 --> 29:39.070]  appearances over the years.
[29:39.270 --> 29:40.330]  Just absolutely classics.
[29:40.790 --> 29:44.810]  The dude changed his name from Old Dirty Bastard to Big Baby Jesus.
[29:45.390 --> 29:48.610]  And then after that, he changed his name to Dirt McGirt.
[29:48.610 --> 29:51.110]  And he had like 13 kids.
[29:51.550 --> 29:54.250]  He was truly one of a kind.
[29:55.130 --> 29:56.530]  Wu-Tang still tours.
[29:56.930 --> 30:02.550]  And Young Dirty Bastard, one of ODB's kids, fills in for him for all of his parts.
[30:02.770 --> 30:04.350]  And I saw them live.
[30:04.490 --> 30:06.030]  And he's so fucking good.
[30:06.390 --> 30:06.790]  That's awesome.
[30:07.130 --> 30:08.230]  Young Dirty Bastard rules.
[30:08.410 --> 30:09.990]  Anyway, that's a very long-winded story.
[30:10.030 --> 30:11.090]  I'm sorry, but that's my pick.
[30:11.190 --> 30:11.770]  I love ODB.
[30:12.450 --> 30:12.730]  Okay.
[30:12.950 --> 30:14.130]  That's a great pick, Eric.
[30:14.410 --> 30:14.770]  Thank you.
[30:14.770 --> 30:16.730]  I guess I am up next.
[30:17.030 --> 30:19.650]  So I'm going to continue on with...
[30:20.590 --> 30:22.650]  We were speaking about Sweden earlier.
[30:22.770 --> 30:24.270]  This is another Swedish band.
[30:24.890 --> 30:31.350]  And this was a really important album in the world of punk rock and kind of a misunderstood album.
[30:32.330 --> 30:33.250]  I'm going to pick...
[30:33.250 --> 30:35.870]  It's not the best song from the album, but it's the most popular song.
[30:35.970 --> 30:36.890]  And it's the one you'll recognize.
[30:37.070 --> 30:38.190]  And it's a phenomenal song.
[30:38.530 --> 30:41.370]  I'm going to pick the song New Noise by the band Refused.
[30:41.670 --> 30:43.170]  The thing about this album...
[30:43.170 --> 30:44.270]  It came out in 1998.
[30:44.270 --> 30:47.010]  They were a hardcore band from Sweden that was really popular.
[30:47.410 --> 30:50.030]  They had some victory releases that were really good.
[30:50.610 --> 30:56.770]  And they created this album called The Shape of Punk to Come, which is a pretty ballsy
[30:56.770 --> 30:57.950]  album title.
[30:58.090 --> 31:00.090]  They were basically throwing down the gauntlet and saying,
[31:00.550 --> 31:01.070]  We are now...
[31:01.830 --> 31:05.250]  We are going to create the sound that punk will become going forward.
[31:05.450 --> 31:06.890]  And they released this album.
[31:07.190 --> 31:09.850]  This album, one of the best albums ever made.
[31:10.230 --> 31:11.290]  I truly believe that.
[31:11.290 --> 31:16.830]  When it came out, it got slammed by negative reviews and bad reviews for about the first
[31:16.830 --> 31:17.830]  three weeks it came out.
[31:18.150 --> 31:20.850]  The band broke up because of the reviews.
[31:21.470 --> 31:23.450]  They released what became...
[31:23.450 --> 31:26.770]  And by the way, about six months later, it became acknowledged that this is one of the
[31:26.770 --> 31:27.730]  best albums of all time.
[31:27.830 --> 31:30.010]  And it was The Shape of Punk to Come.
[31:30.150 --> 31:35.070]  If you listen to that album through the entirety, you're going to recognize so much of what punk
[31:35.070 --> 31:36.830]  and music and that kind of sound turned into.
[31:37.090 --> 31:37.830]  They were right.
[31:37.830 --> 31:43.670]  They really, with that one album, turned that scene on its head and reinvented punk rock.
[31:43.970 --> 31:44.850]  So nobody got it yet?
[31:45.150 --> 31:45.570]  They didn't.
[31:45.650 --> 31:47.830]  They got negative reviews for like three weeks.
[31:48.230 --> 31:50.710]  They were brutally depressed, right?
[31:50.730 --> 31:53.110]  Because it was so different from the work that they had done before.
[31:53.310 --> 31:55.030]  And they were really going out on a limb.
[31:55.270 --> 31:56.390]  And it got panned.
[31:56.510 --> 31:57.390]  And so they broke up.
[31:57.430 --> 31:58.170]  And that was it.
[31:58.490 --> 32:04.090]  Then that album became one of the most popular albums of the era and of punk.
[32:04.090 --> 32:08.330]  And so 16 years later, they got back together and played a reunion show.
[32:08.430 --> 32:11.130]  And they didn't realize how popular they were.
[32:11.250 --> 32:11.310]  Yeah.
[32:11.390 --> 32:13.650]  Because they were so depressed and bummed out by it.
[32:13.830 --> 32:15.170]  So now they're back together, I think.
[32:15.310 --> 32:19.190]  I actually got to see them play at Fun Fun Fun Fest in, I think, 2016.
[32:19.830 --> 32:22.830]  And it was one of the, maybe the best show I've ever seen.
[32:23.110 --> 32:24.630]  One of the best albums of all time.
[32:24.990 --> 32:25.990]  A phenomenal song.
[32:26.190 --> 32:27.670]  New Noise, By The Refused.
[32:27.850 --> 32:30.390]  They made a bold statement when they said they were going to change punk rock.
[32:30.450 --> 32:31.050]  And they did.
[32:31.190 --> 32:32.970]  It, unfortunately, it cost them their band.
[32:32.970 --> 32:35.590]  Was that who you went to see when I went and watched Girl Talk?
[32:35.970 --> 32:38.650]  Yeah, it was one of the most difficult decisions I've had to make.
[32:39.170 --> 32:43.010]  Because Girl Talk was playing on one stage and Refused were playing on another stage.
[32:43.170 --> 32:47.910]  And I was already planning to go to Sweden to see them locally in Sweden
[32:47.910 --> 32:48.990]  when I found out they were back together.
[32:49.110 --> 32:50.310]  But then they played Austin.
[32:50.550 --> 32:51.110]  And so I went.
[32:53.090 --> 32:55.490]  And Refused was better than Girl Talk, but Girl Talk was very good, too.
[32:55.630 --> 32:58.510]  It was difficult to have to run back and forth between the two shows.
[33:00.370 --> 33:06.870]  The thing that I always thought about with the New Noise music video is that that's it's the,
[33:06.990 --> 33:09.770]  it's, you know, the shape of the punk to come and all that stuff.
[33:10.090 --> 33:12.790]  Every band ripped off this look.
[33:12.950 --> 33:13.330]  Yeah.
[33:13.650 --> 33:14.870]  Four years later.
[33:15.430 --> 33:23.030]  It is crazy how this is just, that's what Thursday and taking back Sunday and
[33:23.030 --> 33:27.550]  every band just looked like the way that Refused looked in 1998.
[33:27.550 --> 33:32.450]  Probably the most influential, one of the three or four most influential punk bands
[33:32.990 --> 33:34.250]  or albums of all time.
[33:34.350 --> 33:35.930]  I would put Op Ivy up there with that as well.
[33:36.050 --> 33:40.210]  Would just like change the scene forever after that album came out.
[33:40.350 --> 33:41.410]  Uh, Gavin?
[33:41.890 --> 33:46.550]  In the summer of 98, a lot of my time was taken up by this thing.
[33:47.470 --> 33:49.770]  Yeah, oh boy, I know where we're going, baby.
[33:49.790 --> 33:50.690]  I know what you're doing.
[33:50.910 --> 33:52.510]  That's coming home, baby.
[33:53.010 --> 33:55.870]  Three Lions, the 1998 version.
[33:55.870 --> 34:02.170]  Obviously it was originally written for the Euros in 96, featuring different lyrics that
[34:02.170 --> 34:03.390]  they changed for the 98 version.
[34:03.850 --> 34:09.590]  I think one of the lyrics from the 96 version was 30 years of hurt because England haven't
[34:09.590 --> 34:12.530]  won the World Cup since 1966.
[34:13.130 --> 34:18.430]  And then I think last year, comedians Frank Skinner and David Baddiel, who made the song
[34:18.430 --> 34:24.550]  with the lightning seeds, released a new 2022 version, which featured the lyrics 56 years
[34:24.550 --> 34:24.870]  of hurt.
[34:27.590 --> 34:29.810]  Which I thought was very funny.
[34:31.170 --> 34:32.450]  That's great.
[34:32.810 --> 34:33.930]  That's awesome.
[34:34.330 --> 34:37.010]  The male team still has not won since 1966.
[34:37.530 --> 34:42.810]  But that thing, that song was bumping through the houses in the summer of 98.
[34:43.350 --> 34:44.370]  That's hilarious.
[34:44.850 --> 34:45.430]  What a pick.
[34:46.410 --> 34:48.890]  That's a great, that's a very funny pick.
[34:51.490 --> 34:52.710]  I like that a lot.
[34:52.710 --> 34:52.990]  56 years.
[34:57.210 --> 35:05.610]  Yes, this is such a weird follow up to this, because when I think of, like, music I listened
[35:05.610 --> 35:12.610]  to as a kid that lived within that space exclusively, Spice Girls and the other artist that comes
[35:12.610 --> 35:17.450]  to mind is Ricky Martin, running through the house, listening to Ricky Martin.
[35:17.610 --> 35:21.890]  I actually thought that this is what Gavin was going to pick, because I'm going with
[35:21.890 --> 35:27.690]  the Cup of Life by Ricky Martin, which was the theme to the France 98 World Cup.
[35:27.790 --> 35:29.850]  It was the song for the World Cup that year.
[35:29.990 --> 35:32.590]  There's some real bangers for World Cup songs.
[35:32.850 --> 35:36.310]  Something I learned in like, I was like, wow, every World Cup song I can think of is a banger.
[35:36.490 --> 35:37.630]  So I was looking at the list.
[35:38.010 --> 35:43.930]  They introduced mascot songs in like 2012 or whatever, like 2012, 2014 in that era,
[35:44.050 --> 35:48.690]  which I think is fucking hilarious to have a song dedicated to the mascot of that World
[35:48.690 --> 35:49.270]  Cup.
[35:49.270 --> 35:53.950]  It was a Pitbull song, which is even better, but more focused on my pick.
[35:54.250 --> 35:57.830]  Ricky Martin, to me, is like such a staple of the 90s.
[35:58.830 --> 36:03.250]  His music was just so much fun to listen to running around the house.
[36:03.410 --> 36:06.010]  Great song and absolute banger, the Cup of Life.
[36:06.150 --> 36:07.110]  I love it.
[36:07.170 --> 36:07.490]  Awesome.
[36:07.910 --> 36:14.170]  I have a special place in my heart because Mega64 100th podcast and then really like
[36:14.170 --> 36:19.670]  subsequent every 100 podcasts, it would just be instead of an episode, they would just
[36:19.670 --> 36:21.830]  dance to Cup of Life and release it.
[36:23.730 --> 36:27.130]  I don't know why that's the funniest song, but it's the funniest song.
[36:27.590 --> 36:28.590]  That's very good.
[36:29.130 --> 36:29.610]  Nick.
[36:30.110 --> 36:35.810]  So before we started recording, Geoff dropped a link in our Discord about highly empathic
[36:35.810 --> 36:40.030]  people who have a unique view of music and just like how they react to it and everything.
[36:40.030 --> 36:45.150]  And so we were talking about how like we both, I think we both kind of feel that, Geoff and I.
[36:45.530 --> 36:49.930]  And yeah, this is the song that I feel like it was the first song that it really like,
[36:49.990 --> 36:52.210]  I don't know, had like an emotional, like almost response to it.
[36:52.250 --> 36:54.890]  Like, I don't know, like every time I hear it, I still get like kind of the goosebumps,
[36:55.070 --> 36:58.590]  like almost a little bit sad or like, I don't know, kind of a weird nostalgia.
[37:00.110 --> 37:03.970]  Like the song, though, is Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls.
[37:04.590 --> 37:04.910]  Yeah.
[37:05.370 --> 37:09.310]  And there's something, I don't know, like it's a power ballad, but there are moments where it's
[37:09.310 --> 37:15.990]  kind of sweet and slow and it's like, oh, you know, it just has that feel to it of just being
[37:15.990 --> 37:21.030]  really somber, if that's the right way to put it. But I don't know, it just sticks with me.
[37:21.050 --> 37:23.090]  And every time I hear it, I'm like, oh yeah, I got to turn this up.
[37:23.570 --> 37:24.510]  That's a huge song, too.
[37:25.290 --> 37:25.470]  Yeah.
[37:25.590 --> 37:25.890]  Yeah.
[37:26.790 --> 37:27.130]  Absolutely.
[37:27.270 --> 37:30.750]  I mean, that was really, that was a big, I felt like it was everywhere
[37:31.470 --> 37:33.730]  inescapable, right? In that time.
[37:34.070 --> 37:35.390]  Still kind of is, I feel like.
[37:35.390 --> 37:39.290]  Yeah, I definitely feel like you hear that. You could definitely hear that song a lot.
[37:39.430 --> 37:45.530]  I feel like Goo Goo Dolls have been around for a very, very, very long time,
[37:45.650 --> 37:50.510]  like got popular in like the late 90s, but we're like around in like the 80s.
[37:51.530 --> 37:57.550]  Yeah, I think so, too. That album also that year also had a bunch of songs that were really sad,
[37:57.610 --> 38:03.910]  like Slide. They had a lot of songs on there. You're like, oh, this is some really messed up
[38:03.910 --> 38:04.590]  stuff.
[38:04.890 --> 38:07.130]  Yeah, this is a good one. Good pick.
[38:07.470 --> 38:08.070]  Thank you.
[38:08.770 --> 38:14.810]  I am going in a different direction from my last picks, where so far I've chosen a lot of
[38:14.810 --> 38:22.190]  hip hop and some punk stuff or whatever. This song I feel like is a very,
[38:23.170 --> 38:29.690]  it's weird that it came out when it did because it was recorded so long before,
[38:30.050 --> 38:33.010]  but my pick is Sweetest Thing by U2.
[38:35.370 --> 38:45.250]  It was recorded in 80... when did Joshua Tree come out? 86? 87? And then was released in like 98.
[38:46.110 --> 38:46.430]  Whoa.
[38:47.010 --> 38:53.370]  Yeah, very weird, right? And Bono wrote it as an apology to his wife.
[38:55.250 --> 38:56.370]  Was he just sitting on it?
[38:57.010 --> 39:05.950]  It is. It is a song that was very weird that it never really came out and then released in 98,
[39:06.050 --> 39:13.590]  huge song. And it, to me, marks the end. I've had a lot of conversations with like Shane
[39:14.190 --> 39:21.070]  at work about this time in music, because this is right when alternative starts going away
[39:21.790 --> 39:30.350]  and like on the radio and you get instead this rise of adult contemporary. And that's like
[39:30.350 --> 39:38.430]  one headlight by what's Jacob Dillon's band, The Wallflowers. And you get like Sweetest Thing and
[39:38.430 --> 39:43.370]  you get Sheryl Crow's stuff. There's just like this turn in music and Sweetest Thing is a really
[39:43.370 --> 39:50.450]  big thing. It's like VH1 takes over. That's how this song is for me. But I think it's a great U2
[39:50.450 --> 39:55.310]  song because it's recorded during Joshua Tree sessions, which are probably some of their best
[39:55.310 --> 39:59.750]  stuff. So big U2 fan. I think it's a great song. All right. That's an awesome pick.
[40:00.290 --> 40:00.430]  Fantastic.
[40:01.750 --> 40:09.090]  I guess I'm up. The next band I'm going to pick is a band that has a very special place in my
[40:09.090 --> 40:17.530]  heart because I was lucky enough to be in New Jersey, live in New Jersey in 97, 98, when all
[40:17.530 --> 40:22.130]  this explosion of really good punk was happening. And so I got to go to a ton of shows up at the
[40:22.130 --> 40:28.810]  Knitting Factory and at the Coney Island High RIP in New York City. I got to see a ton of great
[40:28.810 --> 40:33.470]  shows in St. Mark's Place and in that scene. And one of the bands that played there all the time,
[40:33.570 --> 40:38.790]  who was really, really catching fire in the moment and becoming everybody's favorite band,
[40:38.830 --> 40:42.890]  we had no idea how big they were going to get, was this band from Massachusetts called
[40:42.890 --> 40:48.670]  Dropkick Murphys. And I was really, really fortunate enough to see them with their original
[40:48.670 --> 40:53.450]  singer, Mike McColgan, before he left. He left after their first big album and was replaced by a
[40:53.450 --> 40:57.390]  guy named Al Barr, who is still the lead singer. He's very good. And if you watch the Dropkick
[40:57.390 --> 41:01.050]  Murphys now, that's what you're seeing. But the original Dropkick Murphys was a little less
[41:01.050 --> 41:07.490]  Irish and a little more street punk. And so I'm picking a very popular song called Barroom Hero
[41:07.490 --> 41:13.270]  from their first big album with the original singer. It's an anthem.
[41:13.990 --> 41:17.890]  That's that band, man. Still going strong.
[41:19.130 --> 41:23.470]  Also, I'll say Ken Casey, one of the members of the band, is one of the coolest dudes on earth.
[41:23.950 --> 41:28.670]  And he recently went viral because he gave an anti-MAGA speech at a concert. It was one of the
[41:28.670 --> 41:35.050]  coolest fucking things I've ever seen. That's great. Awesome. Good pick. I think Dropkick Murphys
[41:35.050 --> 41:41.970]  have a lot to say and they've been having a lot to say for a long time. Have they found their
[41:41.970 --> 41:47.750]  wooden leg yet? Are they still looking? I think they're still looking. They're on the search.
[41:50.850 --> 41:54.950]  Gavin? This is another thing that I could not escape. It was playing everywhere. I'm not sure
[41:54.950 --> 42:01.730]  if it ever made it to the U.S. It was a song called Horny or apparently Horny 98. The lyrics
[42:01.730 --> 42:08.910]  just went, uh, I'm horny, horny, horny, horny. And it did that over and over again to some trumpets.
[42:10.790 --> 42:14.350]  I've never heard this. What the fuck are you talking about?
[42:16.430 --> 42:20.210]  Uh, literally inescapable. It was playing everywhere for some reason. Oh my god.
[42:20.530 --> 42:23.710]  I'm gonna drop a YouTube link for us because we don't know what this is.
[42:23.710 --> 42:28.410]  Yeah. What? What the fuck?
[42:29.830 --> 42:35.790]  Moosey featuring Hot and Juicy, Horny 98, and it's just a guy in a bunny suit outside of a
[42:35.790 --> 42:40.010]  grocery store is the thumbnail. This is... Yeah, skip to like 50 seconds for the chorus.
[42:40.470 --> 42:45.470]  Okay. What the fuck is going on? What the fuck is going on?
[42:49.150 --> 42:52.410]  1998's worldwide smash hit is what it says.
[42:54.350 --> 42:58.050]  Yeah, I wonder if she, uh, I wonder if she ever got late.
[42:58.810 --> 43:01.030]  Yeah, I think she was in heat.
[43:02.750 --> 43:05.720]  So horny. I'm horny, horny, horny.
[43:10.290 --> 43:12.950]  I like that it's called Horny 98.
[43:13.930 --> 43:15.890]  Does she sing it 98 times?
[43:16.610 --> 43:17.370]  Oh, she might have.
[43:19.810 --> 43:21.720]  Um, Andrew, um...
[43:22.200 --> 43:23.040]  Another one?
[43:23.260 --> 43:27.320]  Yeah, no, this is I'm going to say this is my last pick because I've got a lot of other things,
[43:27.380 --> 43:33.340]  but this is the last one I feel strongly about. And maybe it's just like a bias for like the time
[43:33.340 --> 43:38.780]  I grew up in. Obviously, like that's a very impactful thing for like how you perceive music.
[43:39.220 --> 43:48.480]  I view like the 90s and like the boy band era of music to be like the best junk food period
[43:48.480 --> 43:57.180]  of music. And I say that lovingly in the sense of like these are manufactured songs designed in
[43:57.180 --> 44:02.500]  every way and have nothing like natural in them, but they are so easy to listen to.
[44:02.640 --> 44:08.900]  They're such an earworm. They're so catchy. I am going with one. The lights go out by five.
[44:09.320 --> 44:09.500]  Wow.
[44:09.720 --> 44:13.060]  Nothing really impactful to say about five as a group.
[44:13.200 --> 44:16.440]  Didn't really know a lot about them before starting this process,
[44:16.440 --> 44:22.680]  but the chorus of that song has been stuck in my head since I listened to it. It's such a just it
[44:22.680 --> 44:28.280]  I would say it's a banger. And I just have such a love of this era of like pop music.
[44:28.680 --> 44:30.800]  Five like the British boy band five?
[44:30.940 --> 44:32.740]  Yes, that is that is who he's talking about.
[44:32.820 --> 44:35.660]  I had no idea that was an international band to be honest.
[44:35.940 --> 44:43.820]  Yeah, I will say it wasn't. You kind of heard the song in the U.S. a little bit, but it was not.
[44:44.300 --> 44:44.680]  Wow.
[44:44.680 --> 44:51.000]  Yeah. Let's see. Billboard top 100. It was number peak position number 10.
[44:51.480 --> 44:56.640]  But I mean, in Canada, it also reached number 10. Why were you why do you have an affection for this?
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.440]  Why do I have an affection for it?
[44:59.940 --> 45:00.200]  Yeah.
[45:00.620 --> 45:05.720]  I just I I just yeah, it's something I listened to as part of this process and it just got stuck
[45:05.720 --> 45:11.520]  in my head. And like the next day I woke up and the first thing in my brain was when the lights
[45:11.520 --> 45:16.660]  go out. And much like Gavin was saying, I don't know any other part of that song.
[45:16.780 --> 45:21.000]  So it's just a loop in my brain of this that over and over and over again.
[45:21.800 --> 45:23.480]  That's wow. That's so crazy.
[45:23.600 --> 45:26.580]  So that is my last submission. I have other songs on this list. Maybe at the end,
[45:26.600 --> 45:30.700]  I'd like to make an honorable mention of just like there's a song that made my list purely
[45:30.700 --> 45:36.420]  on some of the lyrics of it being ridiculous. But that is my last official submission.
[45:36.700 --> 45:38.640]  OK, I like it. Nick?
[45:39.140 --> 45:41.880]  You know, I'll make this my last official submission, too. You know,
[45:41.920 --> 45:44.820]  I've got a couple others that we can do like honorable mention on. But
[45:45.320 --> 45:48.600]  this is a song that actually I heard the other day, like I was just flipping through the radio
[45:48.600 --> 45:52.440]  stations here in town and I you know, I don't do that often anymore. We have podcasts and
[45:52.440 --> 45:58.000]  things to listen to. And I happened to just pop over and I caught Inside Out by Eve Six,
[45:58.060 --> 46:04.820]  which came out in May of 1998. And it's just a song that gets stuck in your head right from
[46:04.820 --> 46:09.660]  the very beginning. You know, it's also one of the songs where I didn't realize when it came out.
[46:09.760 --> 46:13.280]  Like I thought it came out much later because I spoke to my wife and she's like, oh, yeah,
[46:13.280 --> 46:18.260]  that was from 98. I was like, what? Get out of here. Oh, yeah. I like I had that CD. I remember.
[46:18.620 --> 46:22.580]  I don't know why I had that CD. It's not like I really liked it that much, but
[46:24.660 --> 46:30.160]  definitely that was a big one. That was a really big one. Really fun, you know, alternative song.
[46:30.160 --> 46:35.980]  Yeah. I have other ones, but I'm going to go with these guys. I'm going to say this is going to be
[46:35.980 --> 46:47.180]  my last pick for this playlist. 1998 was definitely a lot of radio stuff for me. And I think this was
[46:47.180 --> 46:57.500]  probably where I developed a love for music that my wife hates because she doesn't. I like really
[46:57.500 --> 47:04.340]  like singers with like a very like affected voice. I listen to like a lot of music like
[47:04.340 --> 47:09.200]  Hot Snakes and stuff like this where it's like very it's crunchy, it's different, like it's just
[47:09.200 --> 47:15.980]  different vocals and everything. My pick, my last pick here is going to be Never There by K.A.K.E.
[47:16.380 --> 47:24.640]  and she can't stand this band because this guy talks, sings, and it's not just like it's not
[47:24.640 --> 47:30.140]  hardly even music. I love K.A.K.E. K.A.K.E. I think it's a great band. There are other songs
[47:30.140 --> 47:38.900]  that I like more on this album, but I think Never There is probably the biggest hit from the album
[47:38.900 --> 47:43.760]  that you could put on sort of anywhere and people would be like, oh yeah, it starts with like
[47:43.760 --> 47:51.840]  the phone like dial tone and him talking, singing, and it's such every time I hear on the radio,
[47:51.840 --> 47:56.120]  it's just like, oh, I love this. I fucking love this thing. But if you're going to listen to that
[47:56.120 --> 48:00.240]  album, I think Mexico is a better song, but I'm not going to put it on this playlist. I'm going
[48:00.240 --> 48:05.280]  to put Never There by K.A.K.E. I only have one K.A.K.E. song and it's the one from me, myself,
[48:05.340 --> 48:10.680]  and Irene. It's like whistling along to it and then he like sucks on the woman's tit for a little
[48:10.680 --> 48:24.420]  bit. You don't see that movie? I don't remember that at all. Hey, yeah, I feel like I remember
[48:24.420 --> 48:32.780]  that. And he has a little milk mustache. Yeah. Yeah. Gavin went from horny 98 to sucking on a
[48:32.780 --> 48:39.080]  tit. I'll say this, me, myself, and Irene is better than Something About Mary. Yeah, I agree
[48:39.080 --> 48:49.740]  about Farrelly. Yeah. OK, so go to Geoff. OK, so these are last picks. Yeah, sure. OK, sure.
[48:50.080 --> 48:54.140]  I had a bunch more, obviously. Maybe I can do like what is lists and bands I didn't get to at
[48:54.140 --> 48:58.700]  the end. But because this is the last pick, I'm going to pick the band that I was going to pick
[48:58.700 --> 49:04.920]  last. I could have put them first. I probably should have, because it's probably the most
[49:04.920 --> 49:11.560]  important. It sounds silly to say, but probably the most important album of my life for some
[49:11.560 --> 49:17.680]  personal reasons. In early 1998, when I was living in New Jersey, I was running... Rooster Teeth
[49:17.680 --> 49:23.460]  started for me a lot earlier than Rooster Teeth. I was running an online punk zine in the 90s,
[49:23.640 --> 49:27.980]  and I was pretty deep into it. I was doing lots of interviews with bands. I was doing lots of
[49:27.980 --> 49:33.300]  album reviews. I had like a staff of like stringers that would submit reviews. I was getting so many
[49:33.300 --> 49:36.860]  free records in. I was able to give them out to friends so they could do reviews. I had a little
[49:36.860 --> 49:43.280]  empire going. And I kept hearing about this local band from New Jersey that was getting a lot of
[49:43.280 --> 49:48.260]  heat. And so I reached out to them. And I asked if I could interview them. And I went and I had
[49:48.260 --> 49:53.220]  coffee and interviewed them one night. And we hit it off. And the trumpet player, he said,
[49:53.280 --> 49:58.080]  Hey, why don't you come just sit in at our practice tomorrow? And I was like, Why would I do that? I
[49:58.080 --> 50:01.320]  don't play music. And he goes, Just come hang out with us. And so I did. And I went and I sat in.
[50:01.320 --> 50:05.320]  I watched them play in a basement practice. And then after the end, I was shooting the shit with
[50:05.320 --> 50:10.520]  them. And they came to me and they said, Listen, man, we really like you. We felt like we clicked
[50:10.520 --> 50:14.820]  with you immediately. You seem like a really good dude. Would you like to be... it was out of left
[50:14.820 --> 50:20.100]  field, but would you like to be our roadie? And I said, Absolutely. And from that moment on, I was
[50:20.100 --> 50:25.500]  the roadie of a band called Catch 22. I went on one national tour with them. I was there when their
[50:25.500 --> 50:32.540]  lead singer left the band. I was a part of that whole thing. I got to be at ground floor when a
[50:32.540 --> 50:38.880]  truly phenomenal, talented band was becoming the thing that they would become and then also going
[50:38.880 --> 50:44.560]  through the pains of band member changes and stuff. They released an album called KSB Nights.
[50:44.640 --> 50:49.800]  I could pick any song off of KSB Nights, because they're all phenomenal. But I'm just going to pick
[50:49.800 --> 50:56.260]  at random Nine Millimeter and a three-piece suit by Catch 22. I still, to this day, love them
[50:56.260 --> 51:01.700]  dearly and still consider most of them to be really close friends. And it's a truly awesome
[51:01.700 --> 51:07.780]  ska-punk album, even if you don't like ska-punk. That's awesome. Written by a bunch of 16 and
[51:07.780 --> 51:12.840]  17-year-old kids. Wow. Keep that in mind when you listen to this album. That's crazy. That's
[51:12.840 --> 51:16.960]  crazy. It's really nuts when you look at music and you realize it's just written by everyone
[51:16.960 --> 51:21.420]  that's like 23. You're like, wow, they're like really influencing the world at 23 years old.
[51:21.520 --> 51:26.060]  Yeah, it's nuts. Absolutely. Great pick. I think that's, I think there's a lot of,
[51:26.200 --> 51:31.280]  I think you have a lot of sentimental reasons for choosing that. But I also think that great,
[51:31.560 --> 51:37.220]  great, great, like awesome choice. Yeah. Just a fantastic bunch of guys. Fantastic album.
[51:37.480 --> 51:43.540]  And, you know, a bunch of sidebands of spun off and they're all good. Speaking of awesome choice
[51:43.540 --> 51:53.020]  here isn't one. It is Vindaloo by Fat Les. Another football banger that I think was only topped by
[51:53.800 --> 52:00.880]  the Three Lions song. It's sort of like a military beat. Some bloke walking down the street with
[52:00.880 --> 52:07.320]  lyrics such as something like, could I interest you please in a slice of cheddar cheese? And then
[52:07.320 --> 52:12.760]  they just start singing Vindaloo, Vindaloo. And it's still sung at football games to this very day.
[52:13.600 --> 52:20.660]  That sounds like a very Gavin song. You were very influenced by like football music. Yeah.
[52:21.180 --> 52:27.400]  Like that was just like a big part of your life. Like, are you like, are you like a huge football
[52:27.400 --> 52:32.680]  fan? Uh, not the biggest football fan in general, but you're just so exposed to it when your family
[52:32.680 --> 52:37.100]  likes football and when everyone stops everything they're doing to watch England play in the World
[52:37.100 --> 52:45.180]  Cup. Very interesting. Very interesting. Um, these are, this is a great playlist. This is,
[52:45.440 --> 52:51.480]  it's crazy. It's all over the place, but in a way where if you put these on random and they came up,
[52:51.540 --> 52:55.320]  you would be like, oh, fuck. Yeah. Oh, fuck. Yeah. Like I think you'd go back to back and be
[52:55.320 --> 53:00.420]  like, oh, these are pretty nuts. Um, I honestly feel bad that some of my picks are ruining this
[53:00.420 --> 53:05.300]  playlist, but this is honestly, this is honestly the shit that I was listening to. No, that's
[53:05.300 --> 53:12.360]  great. Because you need stuff with different tempos in different, like you need to be,
[53:12.500 --> 53:18.540]  if everything's the same, I think for a playlist, it starts getting really sort of like muddy and
[53:18.540 --> 53:27.320]  you don't hear the songs. But if three lions by lightning seeds comes on and then the next song
[53:27.320 --> 53:33.400]  is five lessons learned by swinging udders and then Iris by Goo Goo Dolls plays, and then it's
[53:33.400 --> 53:38.000]  Cup of Life by Ricky Martin. You're going to hear every one of those songs. Oh, absolutely.
[53:38.340 --> 53:41.300]  You're going to hear every one of those songs. I think it's great.
[53:41.360 --> 53:45.080]  I think you did great. Me and me mom and me dad and me gran were off to Waterloo.
[53:45.440 --> 53:48.740]  Me and me mom, me dad and me gran and a bucket of vindaloo.
[53:53.020 --> 53:57.760]  What I love so much about this, and I think it shows in like some of the other like draft stuff
[53:57.760 --> 54:04.680]  we've done as we all grew up at different times in different places. And it's so reflect like this
[54:04.680 --> 54:09.740]  playlist is such a great capturing of like what was specifically important to us in the different
[54:09.740 --> 54:13.400]  time periods and cultures that we grew up in. I think it's awesome. I love this playlist.
[54:13.580 --> 54:18.100]  I agree. Do we want it? So that's going to be a playlist that we put together for you guys and
[54:18.100 --> 54:23.400]  we'll release that for everyone. But do anyone want to talk about some stuff that didn't quite
[54:23.400 --> 54:29.380]  make the list or stuff like honorable mentions? Geoff, I'm sure you have 30. I'll just name bands.
[54:29.500 --> 54:33.180]  I'm just going to go. I had honorable mention. I was going to do OK FM DOA by a band called
[54:33.180 --> 54:39.300]  Dilijer 4. I was going to do Gotta Go by Agnostic Front, a fantastic song called History of a Boring
[54:39.300 --> 54:43.980]  Town by Less Than Jake, which explains what it was like to grow up in Alabama. That's a great one.
[54:44.120 --> 54:49.520]  Then 88 Fingers Louie and one of my favorite songs of all time, Sweet Avenue by Jets to Brazil.
[54:49.520 --> 54:56.220]  Oh, that's so... Is that Orange Rhyming Dictionary? Yes, that is Orange Rhyming Dictionary. Was that 1998?
[54:56.740 --> 55:02.040]  1998. Yeah. And it's such a phenomenal song. And then there was a Lagwagon album that came out
[55:02.040 --> 55:05.960]  that year. It was a lot of good stuff. But I'm really happy with the choices that I made it in.
[55:05.980 --> 55:12.920]  Yeah. I'll throw out Party My House Be There by MXPX from Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo
[55:13.360 --> 55:18.880]  is one that didn't make my list. It's a little too sugary sweet for me to really
[55:19.520 --> 55:28.980]  put on the list, but I liked it a lot. How about... I think I'm Paranoid by Garbage. I think it was a
[55:28.980 --> 55:34.940]  huge song. That was. That was... I mean, that was just a... I really liked that one. I wanted to put
[55:34.940 --> 55:41.380]  Neutral Milk Hotel, but it was like... Just not really a band that I care for, but... What would
[55:41.380 --> 55:48.100]  you put on there? King of... King of Carrot Flowers? Like, I was poking around the album
[55:48.100 --> 55:52.920]  and going, like, I like these. I don't love these. That's just how I feel. Oh, really? Oh, no. In the airplane,
[55:53.080 --> 55:59.660]  over the sea, King of... And King of Carrot Flowers are so fucking good. I like it. I don't love it.
[56:00.780 --> 56:07.080]  You Get What You Give by New Radicals is such a great one-hit wonder to me. And then... Last
[56:07.080 --> 56:12.260]  one-hit wonder, the last one that I wanted to put on, but I didn't, was The Way by Fastball. Apparently
[56:12.260 --> 56:19.600]  an Austin band? Yeah, they were an Austin band. Had no idea. Had no idea. So... Those are my
[56:19.600 --> 56:25.520]  picks. Honorable mentions, anyone else? I have one that is, like, silly. It's not so... There was,
[56:25.700 --> 56:29.180]  like, discussion of figuring out what would be the best format for doing this. At one point,
[56:29.400 --> 56:33.240]  it was going to be kind of a ranked debate, like the movie one. So I was trying to, like,
[56:33.320 --> 56:38.660]  figure out what my top 15 songs are. And so when I was doing that, I was trying to evaluate
[56:38.660 --> 56:45.740]  different things. And I was debating between... I discovered a song in this process by Big Punisher
[56:45.740 --> 56:51.340]  called Still Not a Player. And it has... That was... Oh, that song's so good.
[56:51.640 --> 56:56.120]  As soon as it starts, like, put a smile on my face of a chorus of Still Not a Player,
[56:56.200 --> 57:00.700]  but I crush a lot. I'm like, I'm just... I'm laughing. Like, I'm smiling. I'm having a great
[57:00.700 --> 57:07.540]  time. And then it just definitively made my list when it goes into... I love from Butter Pecan to
[57:07.540 --> 57:11.620]  Blackberry Molass. I don't discriminate. I regulate every shade of the ass. I was like,
[57:11.640 --> 57:15.740]  that's it. It's made. It's made the cut. This is a great song. This is fantastic.
[57:15.900 --> 57:21.480]  He's so... Big Pun rules. That song rules. Still Not a Player is such a good song.
[57:22.200 --> 57:26.260]  And that is my pick. And I think we've wrapped it up. Has everyone...
[57:26.840 --> 57:33.100]  I have one honorable mention. I think it's technically 97, but it peaked to 98.
[57:33.100 --> 57:33.520]  Who cares?
[57:33.800 --> 57:34.700]  Remember Save Tonight?
[57:35.120 --> 57:36.960]  Oh, Invite the Break of Dawn?
[57:37.540 --> 57:42.140]  Yeah, that's just sheerly because that's another song where it's very difficult to get out of the
[57:42.140 --> 57:45.500]  chorus if you don't know the next part. It's just an endless loop.
[57:47.260 --> 57:50.320]  That was Eagle Eye Cherry? Is that who that was?
[57:50.480 --> 57:53.980]  Yeah. Andrew, Andrew, this was a fantastic...
[57:54.900 --> 57:55.400]  This was great.
[57:55.860 --> 57:56.380]  So much fun.
[57:56.520 --> 57:59.700]  Or whatever the fuck it is. This was a fantastic piece of content we just made.
[57:59.980 --> 58:04.600]  And I had so much more. I didn't know how either of these was going to go. I thought the film
[58:04.600 --> 58:07.420]  would go pretty well because it's easy to argue film. I thought this would be...
[58:07.420 --> 58:09.940]  I was a little more concerned because music's a little more nebulous. But
[58:09.940 --> 58:14.640]  this couldn't... Your pivot to building the playlist together, I think, was brilliant.
[58:14.880 --> 58:18.400]  And this ended up being so much fun. And I would love to do it again.
[58:18.980 --> 58:22.440]  Absolutely. I think this was so much fun. It was such a great process.
[58:22.980 --> 58:26.860]  I'm so excited to now listen to this playlist and hear the things that you guys added as someone
[58:26.860 --> 58:32.180]  who hasn't heard a lot of these suggestions. I genuinely cannot wait for this to be put together
[58:32.180 --> 58:34.060]  so I can go through it as well.
[58:34.060 --> 58:38.060]  In that case, we should really throw In The Airplane Over The Sea from Neutral
[58:38.060 --> 58:40.860]  Milk Hotel on the album because I think Andrew will like that song.
[58:41.960 --> 58:43.200]  Yeah, put it on the list.
[58:44.000 --> 58:46.400]  It is not on the list, but it would be an honorable mention.
[58:46.760 --> 58:49.640]  Yeah, honorable mention. In case one of the other songs can't fulfill its duties.
[58:49.820 --> 58:50.600]  It can't fulfill its duties.
[58:51.080 --> 58:54.740]  It's the snake eyes of this. It's the first off the bench.
[58:54.840 --> 58:57.340]  Neutral Milk Hotel is kind of the snake eyes of music, yeah.
[58:59.540 --> 59:02.580]  This was really fun. This was a cool walk down memory lane.
[59:02.580 --> 59:11.000]  I wonder how these two pieces of show are going to be received because I feel like when we are
[59:11.000 --> 59:17.260]  combative at all, people go like, no, I don't like when they fight. But this was so just listing,
[59:17.400 --> 59:20.600]  I like this thing. And then somebody goes, that's cool. I like this thing.
[59:20.900 --> 59:23.260]  This one was very Mouldroft and vibes.
[59:23.460 --> 59:25.600]  It was really nice.
[59:26.680 --> 59:31.040]  And we built something in it that then they can enjoy, hopefully,
[59:31.040 --> 59:32.900]  if they enjoy the playlist.
[59:34.160 --> 59:39.460]  Again, summer of 98, the last good summer. 1998, the last good year.
[59:40.320 --> 59:42.480]  Well, we haven't done 2013.
[59:43.040 --> 59:44.160]  Really good year for music.
[59:44.760 --> 59:49.400]  Yeah, it was crazy. For movies, for music, really pop culture touchstone, 1998. It's a good one.
[59:50.100 --> 59:54.760]  Really makes you want to wear a backwards hat and go on a roller coaster.
[59:54.760 --> 59:59.260]  Just that's what this all sounds like.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.960]  See, that's what I'm saying. Like, it sounds like that.
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:07.520]  You need to put that Dr. Seuss hat back on. That's what started. That's what started this whole thing.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:11.780]  Oh, dude, that's you know what? That needs to be the cover of this playlist.
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.080]  Yes, it's the Dr. Seuss hat.
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:14.800]  Absolutely.
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.920]  Yeah, that is great. It was Millie getting a Dr. Seuss hat and me being jealous.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:23.040]  That was on my, like, birthday laser tag, wasn't it?
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.460]  It was. Exactly what it was. So funny.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:31.480]  That's so funny that the genesis of this. And Eric was only jealous because Millie was like,
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:35.400]  I got all these tickets. I don't know what to buy. And Eric goes, get that hat. You want that hat.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.840]  And Millie's like, all right, I'll get the hat. Then he's like, damn it, I want that hat.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.300]  And then I got the hat, too. It's such a cool hat. It's so awesome.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.280]  That was great. Andrew, you want to take us out? You want to do a cool outro?
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:53.660]  Oh, yeah. Obviously, this is the end of the summer of 98. As you said, the last good year,
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:58.880]  according to you. This was so much fun. I got to listen to you guys talk about picks,
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:03.340]  even though we have an amazing friendship. It's just nice hearing your guys' enthusiasm about
[01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:06.960]  things. And I feel like I learned more about your musical preferences.
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:13.220]  There may be more 98 content in the future. We will see. I hope you enjoyed this. If you have
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:16.560]  songs that you think should have been on the list, I'd love to see what those picks are as well.
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:21.040]  Somebody who just has kind of a hole in music, anything you'd like to add, I'd love to see.
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:25.880]  Thank you guys so much for sharing your picks with you and having such great responses to all this.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.340]  I guess fuck 99, right? Like we're not going forward. This is the end.
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:33.120]  Yeah. Bye. We'll figure it out. Bye-bye.
