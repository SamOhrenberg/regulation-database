[00:00.000 --> 00:06.300]  Riding a tiny BMX at 48, I felt like I was riding a clown bicycle. It's like a three inches off the
[00:06.300 --> 00:12.820]  ground. It was so fucking hard to even pedal that thing. I felt like such a lumbering oaf on it,
[00:12.900 --> 00:16.940]  but it was so much fun. And as I was just screwing the camera, Geoff's like, I'm just gonna,
[00:17.180 --> 00:20.860]  I'll just run the path. I'll test it out. Goes up the thing, goes past me. And then I just hear
[00:20.860 --> 00:27.200]  an explosion. I look over. It's just a cloud of dust in the air.
[00:29.060 --> 00:35.280]  And Geoff's on the floor, nowhere near the bike, dripping blood all over the ground.
[00:36.200 --> 00:41.000]  There's a lot of blood for how little I got cut. You cut the shit out of both hands. Was it both?
[00:41.560 --> 00:46.240]  Yeah, it was both hands. So immediately I was like, oh, we should, we should go back then,
[00:46.300 --> 00:49.920]  right? Like, you surely can't do it now. Fucking, I posted a picture of that and I was just like
[00:49.920 --> 00:53.860]  filming with Gavin. Instagram, it's the first picture I've ever had taken down from Instagram.
[00:53.860 --> 00:58.300]  I logged back in and they were like, remove this image immediately or we'll restrict your account.
