[00:15.240 --> 00:20.080]  Okay, we're good. So now, Geoff can introduce this, and then we can do the whole thing.
[00:20.420 --> 00:23.800]  I don't know why you're giving away trivia and quotes from the thing we're about to watch.
[00:24.140 --> 00:26.120]  Doesn't make any sense. Doesn't make any sense.
[00:26.280 --> 00:27.480]  No, it's just really... okay.
[00:27.860 --> 00:33.000]  I understand what you're doing, but we're trying to watch the movie. Now, now, now,
[00:33.360 --> 00:34.320]  Geoff, take it away.
[00:34.320 --> 00:35.480]  I watched this on VHS.
[00:35.680 --> 00:36.220]  Oh my god.
[00:36.680 --> 00:40.880]  All right, I'll say it right now. I would take it away, but Eric just did a phenomenal
[00:40.880 --> 00:46.220]  job. You heard what he said. He basically encapsulated what's happening. We're watching
[00:46.220 --> 00:50.080]  the tuxedo. This was Andrew's idea, or Gavin's. Somebody's idea. It was definitely not my
[00:50.080 --> 00:56.840]  idea. And everybody's mad. Everybody's yelling and frustrating. And we can't get shit to
[00:56.840 --> 01:02.340]  work. Andrew is lost in the weeds, and Gavin is... I think he's only here by... there's
[01:02.340 --> 01:05.560]  about 30% of Gavin here. But I'm ready to go! Hit play!
[01:05.560 --> 01:11.580]  You love to start stuff by just putting a weird mood on it. Just start stuff! We're
[01:11.580 --> 01:14.540]  all ready! Eric put the weird mood on it when he was yelling!
[01:14.920 --> 01:19.580]  No, no, that was not me. That was Andrew talking about penguin trivia. Listen, here, guys,
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.860]  you can go on HBO Max. You can go on HBO Max and you can watch the tuxedo. This is not
[01:24.860 --> 01:28.880]  an ad for HBO Max. This is just simply where I found it. You can watch this along with
[01:28.880 --> 01:33.680]  us. We're going to count down 3, 2, 1, go. On go, we're going to hit play, and then you
[01:33.680 --> 01:42.200]  guys can watch along with us. Geoff, do you want to count us down? 3, 2, 1, hit play.
[01:42.620 --> 01:50.140]  There we go. It's begun. Oh, Dreamworks! So, fun fact about this, Jackie Chan only made
[01:50.140 --> 01:54.900]  this movie because Steven Spielberg owns Dreamworks, right? And he hated the script, but he's like,
[01:54.940 --> 01:58.980]  I want to work with Spielberg, so this might be an end for that. Jackie Chan hated all
[01:58.980 --> 02:02.940]  of his American movies, which made me sad. He hated Rush Hour. Why did he hate Rush Hour?
[02:02.940 --> 02:07.760]  He didn't understand all of his American movies. He's like, I don't think these are funny. I don't
[02:07.760 --> 02:12.940]  get this humor. So, he's like, I made the first one just to test things out. I made the second
[02:12.940 --> 02:16.400]  because they paid me an ungodly amount of money, and I made the third for the fans.
[02:17.180 --> 02:23.680]  Should I be able to hear anything? It's quiet. I'll turn it up. You can hear me? There you go.
[02:24.420 --> 02:29.300]  It should be listenable now. It's a pretty waterfall. Yeah, and there's a little bit of
[02:29.300 --> 02:35.640]  water running. Oh, Jackie Chan, the fucking titles are falling through the water. Oh, that's a beautiful... deer.
[02:40.580 --> 02:50.240]  That deer's got a white ass. What? Fist joke. We're opening with a fist joke. Oh, a deer is not very hydrated.
[02:51.900 --> 02:57.540]  Is that the earliest piss in a Jackie Chan movie? I think it has to be. It's definitely the earliest
[02:57.540 --> 03:03.240]  deer. I don't know if we can confirm that. I feel really confident about the piss. I don't know about
[03:03.240 --> 03:09.980]  the deer. So, this was written by two guys. One of them has only written Ice Age, essentially. He
[03:09.980 --> 03:17.060]  wrote Ice Age, Shark Tale, and this movie. And the other guy wrote on Happy Days. He's like 62 when
[03:17.060 --> 03:22.880]  he wrote this. So, it's like a great... I think it was like a mentor-mentee type thing. I don't... I feel
[03:22.880 --> 03:26.800]  like one of them probably just did like punch-up joke writing, and I don't know who I'd want to do
[03:26.800 --> 03:36.020]  that role more. Like, either the 62 year old guy or the person that wrote Shark Tale. Oh, man. What a... do you guys ever think about like what
[03:36.020 --> 03:43.920]  celebrities are really into piss? No. No, literally never. It's never crossed my mind. I do too. Think about it all the
[03:43.920 --> 03:50.200]  time. What do you... like, you mean like they have a general interest in it or like as a kink? No, just like weirdos
[03:50.200 --> 03:54.760]  that are in like... like if you found out that David Spade like loved to be pissed on or whatever. I'm not
[03:54.760 --> 04:01.280]  saying he does. I don't know anything about David Spade. I would say that Howard Hughes is the most famous piss guy that is like out
[04:01.280 --> 04:09.260]  there. Yeah, also Chuck Berry, right? Was Chuck Berry into piss? I don't... I hope I'm not getting that wrong. I don't want to be sued by the
[04:09.260 --> 04:16.300]  estate. I do feel like allegedly that's something that I read. Is that libelous to say that someone's a piss guy? A big piss guy? I
[04:16.300 --> 04:24.020]  mean, not to me, but... people are weird. People have got all kinds of hang-ups. All of these bottles are in the sea now.
[04:26.800 --> 04:32.280]  Hey, Andrew, I got a question for you. Yeah, you've pulled out that awesome fact about the writers. Have you ever seen Happy Days?
[04:33.820 --> 04:39.940]  Ah, if I have, it's like maybe one episode randomly. But no, I've never like thought of I'm going to sit down and watch Happy Days.
[04:40.460 --> 04:43.160]  That might be an option for a future one of these.
[04:44.560 --> 04:45.900]  Just a Happy Days episode?
[04:46.140 --> 04:47.520]  Yeah, just watch a Happy Days episode.
[04:48.940 --> 04:52.240]  Then why does it got to be a two hour movie? Why can't it? Why can't we watch a 30 minute TV show?
[04:52.420 --> 04:52.460]  What?
[04:55.700 --> 04:59.380]  He's drowning him in a bag. He was already going to suffocate.
[05:00.160 --> 05:01.300]  What was the...
[05:01.300 --> 05:02.680]  It goes twice as fast.
[05:03.200 --> 05:06.580]  No, this was... there's actually an achievement for this. This is a Hitman thing.
[05:08.220 --> 05:10.400]  Oh, this would be dumb in a Hitman game.
[05:11.020 --> 05:14.540]  He didn't want to wait the extra 25 seconds for him to just suffocate.
[05:18.280 --> 05:23.980]  Oh my God, this guy died. Why is he drenched in water? Like, I feel like the move was to like, try to cover up.
[05:24.660 --> 05:29.420]  I would be thinking more advanced. I'd be like, well, he got hit on the head with an ice cube. The ice cube melted.
[05:29.760 --> 05:30.460]  Oh, it's Jackie.
[05:31.500 --> 05:36.560]  Do you think that art in the window is in somebody's house and they're like, why the fuck did I buy this?
[05:37.460 --> 05:39.800]  Can anyone hear any of the actual audio?
[05:40.300 --> 05:41.820]  Oh, it's the guy from 40 Year Old Virgin.
[05:42.040 --> 05:43.300]  No, I can't hear anything.
[05:43.700 --> 05:45.040]  Yeah, can't hear anything too.
[05:45.500 --> 05:46.600]  No, it's fine. I can read it.
[05:46.860 --> 05:47.660]  Yeah, it's fine. We can read.
[05:48.440 --> 05:49.240]  Some of us can read.
[05:54.300 --> 05:56.240]  Yeah, go tell her that. I heard that.
[05:56.500 --> 05:57.720]  I heard that. Jack?
[05:58.240 --> 06:00.740]  Oh, it's like doing noise cancelling or something. It's like...
[06:01.320 --> 06:02.780]  Pretty pronounced soul patch there.
[06:06.160 --> 06:08.040]  He... this was the follow up to Rush Hour 2.
[06:08.660 --> 06:10.340]  What year is this made?
[06:10.780 --> 06:11.220]  2002.
[06:11.860 --> 06:14.820]  How old is Jackie Chan at this point? Is he Vin Diesel old?
[06:15.500 --> 06:17.200]  I don't know. What do you mean by Vin Diesel?
[06:17.880 --> 06:19.180]  It's just the Ooters girl.
[06:19.300 --> 06:21.040]  He's how I base all ages.
[06:22.920 --> 06:24.280]  I don't know what that means.
[06:25.460 --> 06:25.900]  It's okay.
[06:26.660 --> 06:29.440]  That was the thing we did, right? That was a bit we did before.
[06:29.580 --> 06:31.040]  Yeah, it was a bit we did a long time ago.
[06:31.540 --> 06:33.400]  Right? It's okay. Just tell me how old he is.
[06:33.740 --> 06:34.260]  Do that bit.
[06:34.840 --> 06:35.140]  Okay.
[06:36.460 --> 06:37.640]  How old is Jackie Chan?
[06:41.290 --> 06:41.690]  67.
[06:43.050 --> 06:44.270]  He's 67 right now?
[06:44.770 --> 06:45.090]  Yes.
[06:45.750 --> 06:46.870]  And this was 2002?
[06:47.330 --> 06:48.170]  This is 2002.
[06:49.510 --> 06:51.430]  So that means he was...
[06:52.870 --> 06:53.950]  48 or something?
[06:55.990 --> 06:57.390]  Is that right, Gavin? You're math.
[06:59.270 --> 06:59.790]  Uh.
[07:01.550 --> 07:02.070]  Yeah.
[07:03.910 --> 07:05.430]  That was very convincing.
[07:06.450 --> 07:10.190]  Oh, look, if we were in a millionaire scenario
[07:10.190 --> 07:13.410]  and I called you to, like, confirm, I'd be like, it's A, right?
[07:13.490 --> 07:14.970]  I would feel less confident.
[07:15.190 --> 07:16.610]  Like your recommendation.
[07:17.270 --> 07:19.370]  If I was just like, sure. Yeah.
[07:20.330 --> 07:23.270]  I'm just I'm just wondering why I can't hear anything.
[07:23.810 --> 07:25.390]  I think it's what we're doing.
[07:25.710 --> 07:27.810]  Do we want to just swap?
[07:28.490 --> 07:29.490]  Stream it? I don't.
[07:29.750 --> 07:30.990]  I mean, I can read it.
[07:32.550 --> 07:34.790]  Okay. It's just like there's like a noise.
[07:36.090 --> 07:37.910]  It's like canceling the front of everything.
[07:38.130 --> 07:40.990]  Yeah, I think it's like it's it's purposely blocking this.
[07:41.630 --> 07:43.530]  Hmm. Interesting.
[07:44.350 --> 07:47.090]  I mean, we either have to commit one way or the other.
[07:48.210 --> 07:50.450]  Also, I feel like he was filling the Jeremy Pivitt role.
[07:50.450 --> 07:51.170]  I mean, I think we should hear the movie.
[07:51.570 --> 07:54.110]  I yeah, I would rather not read the tuxedo.
[07:54.110 --> 07:58.730]  Yeah. You guys are fun in foreign films, I bet.
[07:59.650 --> 08:02.710]  I think he looks younger in this than he did in Rush Hour.
[08:03.610 --> 08:05.430]  Oh, he looks that he looks like Rush Hour.
[08:05.950 --> 08:07.350]  I haven't seen it in a long time.
[08:08.630 --> 08:10.350]  Well, he might have been eating healthier or something.
[08:11.230 --> 08:13.770]  I wonder. In America?
[08:15.410 --> 08:16.250]  That's a great point.
[08:16.610 --> 08:21.190]  You're so angry at American food all the time that you wind up.
[08:21.630 --> 08:22.650]  Oh, whoa. What happened?
[08:24.870 --> 08:26.630]  Could have done with an extra angle there.
[08:26.830 --> 08:28.130]  Don't think three was enough.
[08:28.530 --> 08:31.850]  It's I feel like it's really tough to like, if you don't want to do a stunt
[08:31.850 --> 08:35.250]  in a Jackie Chan movie, it's a rare time where Jackie Chan is.
[08:35.390 --> 08:37.810]  What is happening? Why is this escalating?
[08:40.150 --> 08:41.670]  Because people in New York are angry.
[08:42.070 --> 08:43.150]  OK, that's fair.
[08:46.390 --> 08:47.910]  This seems very unnecessary.
[08:49.090 --> 08:51.690]  Yeah, this is similar to like the guy at the beginning of Ace Ventura.
[08:51.690 --> 08:56.170]  Just like Hulk roided up dude doesn't like cars.
[09:00.770 --> 09:04.550]  I like the idea of Jackie Chan eating at Hooters so much.
[09:04.630 --> 09:06.250]  He has a shirt of it.
[09:06.410 --> 09:07.250]  Boo Boo Fred!
[09:12.530 --> 09:14.750]  I'm not your fucking friend!
[09:21.750 --> 09:23.530]  This guy isn't even the villain of the movie.
[09:24.150 --> 09:27.650]  He might be the most menacing character, and he's just random cyclist
[09:27.650 --> 09:29.010]  that Jackie Chan hits.
[09:34.370 --> 09:36.150]  Get a tattoo of a chicken.
[09:36.430 --> 09:39.330]  As I'm going to write that down, you know, you should bottom of the trivia.
[09:40.650 --> 09:43.830]  That could be yeah, you should pick out the like line of the movie, probably.
[09:44.690 --> 09:49.410]  Oh, let me is that that we just almost saw where his asshole is.
[09:50.270 --> 09:52.170]  Was his anus in focus there briefly?
[09:52.330 --> 09:55.870]  I think for almost for like one second, if only he had a tail,
[09:55.990 --> 09:57.790]  there would be a product we could sell him.
[10:02.090 --> 10:03.910]  What is that? I don't think that was a quote.
[10:03.930 --> 10:04.930]  I think they missed that quote.
[10:05.290 --> 10:06.270]  Is that a Palm Pilot?
[10:07.430 --> 10:08.930]  Was it? I don't know.
[10:09.910 --> 10:13.090]  I think she's the person I've seen the most, but don't know what her name is.
[10:13.490 --> 10:15.770]  I've seen that actress in all of the movies.
[10:16.170 --> 10:18.110]  Yeah, I feel like I see her all the time.
[10:20.310 --> 10:22.550]  Am I? Have you never seen her in a thing?
[10:22.910 --> 10:24.790]  No, for sure. I think I could.
[10:26.050 --> 10:28.790]  What else is she in? Entourage shit.
[10:29.270 --> 10:32.050]  Yeah. In like a lot of things I can't name, but she's there.
[10:32.150 --> 10:35.570]  I feel like she's just always she like looks kind of like Milla Jovovich,
[10:35.690 --> 10:38.010]  but I think isn't Milla Jovovich, right? Yeah.
[10:38.910 --> 10:40.790]  Milla Jovovich. Yeah.
[10:42.050 --> 10:43.170]  Yeah, Milla Jovovich.
[10:43.430 --> 10:45.330]  I'm glad I didn't step on that landmine.
[10:45.790 --> 10:47.950]  Thanks, Geoff. No problem.
[10:51.740 --> 10:55.340]  I think she might be on like a CSI or something now.
[10:56.820 --> 11:00.300]  So you bought this the day it came out on DVD, Gavin, so you are.
[11:00.420 --> 11:01.200]  I was so excited.
[11:01.300 --> 11:04.840]  I had it pre-ordered. At this point, did you still pre-ordered this?
[11:06.460 --> 11:07.660]  Yeah, of course I did.
[11:08.380 --> 11:11.580]  There's a dude in Estonia who would love to talk to you.
[11:13.060 --> 11:14.720]  Yeah, you missed that part.
[11:14.920 --> 11:16.340]  Oh, it was before you came. OK.
[11:19.710 --> 11:22.650]  I want to know, tell me at what point, if you remember,
[11:22.650 --> 11:24.390]  where you started to doubt this purchase?
[11:26.090 --> 11:26.950]  Maybe we'll never come.
[11:27.030 --> 11:27.970]  Maybe this is aged.
[11:28.090 --> 11:30.750]  Well, I do remember when I thought this was a shit movie.
[11:30.870 --> 11:32.870]  OK, I'll call it out when it happens.
[11:33.110 --> 11:33.970]  Oh, I'm so excited.
[11:34.650 --> 11:37.590]  At this point, are you still on board like you're into it?
[11:37.710 --> 11:40.130]  Oh, yeah, I was still pretty open minded at this point.
[11:40.210 --> 11:41.930]  I think this is pretty cool so far.
[11:42.010 --> 11:45.470]  A guy driving backwards has already been in a funny fight.
[11:49.850 --> 11:51.250]  A guy got in a fight, though.
[11:51.670 --> 11:52.070]  No.
[11:54.170 --> 11:55.610]  He hid under his cap.
[11:59.950 --> 12:01.350]  He loves a good driving stunt.
[12:01.470 --> 12:04.390]  There was a big driving scene in Who Am I that he did.
[12:05.190 --> 12:07.130]  I think he just likes driving and fighting.
[12:08.210 --> 12:10.010]  And who am I? What is Who Am I?
[12:10.910 --> 12:11.870]  It's a Jackie Chan movie.
[12:12.350 --> 12:13.330]  I've never seen it.
[12:13.490 --> 12:14.530]  Is it? Oh, where is that?
[12:14.790 --> 12:15.690]  It's probably my favorite one.
[12:16.290 --> 12:16.570]  Really?
[12:17.850 --> 12:19.450]  I like that we're watching the tuxedo
[12:19.450 --> 12:21.090]  instead of your favorite.
[12:21.350 --> 12:23.430]  You like it more than what is the Operation Condor?
[12:25.150 --> 12:25.990]  Which was that?
[12:26.750 --> 12:27.390]  That's a Jackie Chan.
[12:27.510 --> 12:27.890]  It's another good one.
[12:28.170 --> 12:29.310]  Yeah, that's a...
[12:29.310 --> 12:32.130]  I know that some of them have had like different names.
[12:33.050 --> 12:33.710]  Oh, yeah.
[12:34.770 --> 12:36.230]  Oh, speaking of different names.
[12:37.490 --> 12:38.890]  Do you know what this movie is called in Argentina?
[12:39.070 --> 12:40.210]  Fun fact. Trivia.
[12:40.350 --> 12:41.270]  Trivia fact for you.
[12:41.690 --> 12:42.070]  The soup.
[12:42.890 --> 12:43.590]  El's smoking.
[12:45.310 --> 12:46.090]  Is that me?
[12:46.490 --> 12:47.330]  I don't know.
[12:47.330 --> 12:49.370]  I have a list of Argentina.
[12:49.590 --> 12:50.430]  It was El's smoking.
[12:51.050 --> 12:53.230]  And the French title for this was La Smoking.
[12:54.770 --> 12:55.650]  Croatia smoking.
[12:55.930 --> 12:57.250]  It was either smoking or tuxedo.
[12:57.390 --> 13:00.110]  So I'm guessing maybe smoking is like an interchangeable
[13:00.650 --> 13:03.610]  word for tuxedo, depending on the smoking suit.
[13:04.530 --> 13:05.690]  I guess. Yeah.
[13:11.120 --> 13:13.180]  That's actually where all of this power comes from.
[13:13.520 --> 13:14.380]  You can't get rid of that.
[13:14.780 --> 13:16.480]  Yeah, that's where all of his driving skill.
[13:17.060 --> 13:19.420]  He's like, but I get so many compliments at the Hooters.
[13:20.720 --> 13:22.240]  They won't recognize me.
[13:23.660 --> 13:24.940]  I won't get my discounts.
[13:27.220 --> 13:29.220]  I'd like to think that was just a shirt he wore.
[13:30.740 --> 13:34.620]  It makes me happy to imagine Jackie Chan is a big Hooters guy.
[13:34.800 --> 13:37.540]  Just loves it. Really into chicken wings.
[13:41.030 --> 13:44.090]  Let me say he should get a tattoo of a chicken because it's a throw.
[13:44.190 --> 13:46.290]  It's like, I'll get another discount on Hooters.
[13:46.390 --> 13:47.010]  I love the wings.
[13:47.370 --> 13:48.250]  And he mentioned the chicken.
[13:48.770 --> 13:51.150]  It's thingy. That was a cool reveal.
[13:53.910 --> 13:54.790]  Oh, Malfoy.
[13:55.390 --> 13:57.150]  Yeah. Jason Isaacs.
[13:57.210 --> 13:58.230]  Jason Isaacs.
[13:58.230 --> 13:59.330]  I think he was also in Hobbit.
[13:59.850 --> 14:01.450]  Well, I think that's correct.
[14:01.550 --> 14:06.950]  I think the last time I saw him, what was the it's a great the comedy.
[14:07.070 --> 14:07.950]  You recommend it to me, Geoff.
[14:07.970 --> 14:08.630]  It's a Russian.
[14:09.390 --> 14:12.390]  It's a Russian satire movie, but it's not Russian.
[14:12.650 --> 14:13.370]  It's like British.
[14:13.490 --> 14:15.410]  All the actors are Geoffrey Tambor's in it.
[14:16.210 --> 14:17.090]  Oh, Stalin.
[14:17.310 --> 14:18.450]  He's in Death of Stalin.
[14:18.790 --> 14:19.790]  Yeah, he is in that.
[14:20.250 --> 14:21.170]  He's great in that.
[14:21.490 --> 14:22.090]  I love that movie.
[14:22.410 --> 14:23.410]  It's a very funny movie.
[14:23.810 --> 14:25.670]  So it's Jason Isaacs, the villain of the movie.
[14:26.190 --> 14:27.410]  No, he's like the hero.
[14:27.510 --> 14:28.470]  He's like the James Bond.
[14:28.950 --> 14:30.030]  Oh, it's his tuxedo.
[14:30.410 --> 14:31.470]  It's his tuxedo.
[14:31.770 --> 14:33.850]  Well, he has the tuxedo.
[14:34.030 --> 14:35.510]  I don't know if it's his tuxedo.
[14:37.230 --> 14:41.030]  I don't really like I'm sure they'll elaborate, but I don't remember.
[14:41.770 --> 14:44.010]  The tuxedo is like sentient, right?
[14:44.010 --> 14:45.090]  Like it's moving.
[14:45.210 --> 14:45.710]  Not you.
[14:45.930 --> 14:47.850]  It's like you're a puppet in the suit.
[14:47.990 --> 14:50.070]  Yeah, it's really weird.
[14:54.760 --> 14:57.800]  Uh-oh, that was a bad salute.
[15:00.840 --> 15:02.260]  Geoff's a real salute snob.
[15:02.320 --> 15:03.040]  He doesn't like dancing.
[15:03.240 --> 15:07.880]  I spent five fucking years in the army having to salute properly.
[15:08.060 --> 15:09.460]  So did Dan. He was seven.
[15:09.700 --> 15:12.400]  Well, yeah, listen, I'm not going to get back into the whole dance thing.
[15:13.200 --> 15:14.920]  That was years ago.
[15:14.920 --> 15:18.480]  And it turns out it's an insult to your entire country.
[15:18.680 --> 15:22.440]  So, oh, it's Phoebe's dad from Friends.
[15:31.180 --> 15:32.760]  That guy, what else is he in?
[15:32.960 --> 15:35.900]  He's probably the guy I've seen the most without knowing his name.
[15:36.060 --> 15:37.560]  Thanks a million things.
[15:38.400 --> 15:41.840]  Bob, I want to say he's a Bob, but I can't tell if it's just his face.
[15:41.920 --> 15:46.960]  He looks like all of like the like Mighty Wind and Spinal Tap and all that.
[15:47.320 --> 15:49.340]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:49.340 --> 15:50.860]  Yeah, Christopher Guest, dude.
[15:52.080 --> 15:54.000]  He looks like a Bob. He could be a Bob.
[15:54.420 --> 15:55.280]  I think he's a Bob.
[15:56.560 --> 15:57.540]  Why don't you look him up?
[15:57.880 --> 15:58.760]  I'm doing it right now.
[15:58.840 --> 16:00.840]  I'm just searching Christopher Guest Bob.
[16:01.440 --> 16:01.940]  See what happens.
[16:02.340 --> 16:04.400]  Of all the things you could have searched.
[16:05.840 --> 16:09.740]  It's not. I got Christopher Guest is the first thing that pops up.
[16:11.280 --> 16:12.760]  Bob Balaban, he is a Bob.
[16:13.820 --> 16:15.700]  Oh, wow. That was a good Bob call.
[16:16.500 --> 16:18.020]  That was a great Bob call.
[16:18.020 --> 16:19.520]  I am great at calling.
[16:19.580 --> 16:22.620]  Probably the most Bob looking Bob that I've seen.
[16:22.640 --> 16:24.540]  But that was still a great Bob call.
[16:26.460 --> 16:28.260]  I'm like a caddy for Bobs.
[16:28.520 --> 16:29.760]  I can just read the room.
[16:29.920 --> 16:32.740]  I can read the Bobs in the room and I can advise you.
[16:33.500 --> 16:35.560]  Well, what was the budget on this film?
[16:36.540 --> 16:37.320]  This was.
[16:37.640 --> 16:39.140]  Let me see if I can find that out.
[16:39.280 --> 16:40.260]  It's a big budget movie.
[16:40.340 --> 16:41.440]  The trivia I have.
[16:42.400 --> 16:43.360]  Tuxedo budget.
[16:48.370 --> 16:49.210]  60 million.
[16:50.450 --> 16:51.930]  Oh, that's pretty significant.
[16:52.210 --> 16:56.230]  It is. This movie opened up in second the weekend it came out,
[16:56.230 --> 17:00.570]  falling to Sweet Home Alabama, number one at the box office that week.
[17:02.850 --> 17:04.490]  Tough to tough to go against.
[17:06.050 --> 17:09.570]  Against what's if Elle Woods at the height of her popularity?
[17:10.470 --> 17:13.710]  I was about to say her name and then you said Elle Woods and it fucked me.
[17:14.050 --> 17:17.630]  I said Elle Woods, but I couldn't remember her real name, so I had to say.
[17:17.630 --> 17:20.750]  I know I was about to say her real name, though, and then you said that
[17:20.750 --> 17:22.190]  and it threw me off completely.
[17:22.730 --> 17:25.630]  Mila, I was going to say her real name, too, but then I did it because I couldn't.
[17:27.750 --> 17:29.570]  That's not Mila Jovovich, that's somebody else.
[17:30.950 --> 17:32.170]  Why? I know.
[17:34.550 --> 17:35.630]  I'm not sure you do.
[17:40.580 --> 17:43.100]  The person who directed this is the only movie they directed.
[17:43.760 --> 17:46.500]  I dude, I was about to say the exact same thing.
[17:46.620 --> 17:49.840]  I just look this up because I went this direction's insane.
[17:51.020 --> 17:52.080]  What don't you like about it?
[17:52.700 --> 17:56.800]  They keep showing mouths and they went to a bug store.
[17:58.240 --> 18:01.300]  Well, that might not be anything to do with the director, the bug store part.
[18:01.700 --> 18:05.760]  But like the way they shot the bug store was like they were at a jewelry store,
[18:05.820 --> 18:07.000]  but it was a bug store.
[18:07.280 --> 18:08.960]  It was a store with bugs in it.
[18:09.340 --> 18:11.520]  I think watching this, you can see like this guy.
[18:11.700 --> 18:12.900]  He was a commercial director.
[18:13.280 --> 18:15.140]  I was up until like 1 a.m.
[18:15.180 --> 18:17.220]  last night watching every commercial he had.
[18:17.320 --> 18:17.860]  He has a website.
[18:18.320 --> 18:19.880]  I watched all of his commercials.
[18:19.880 --> 18:23.820]  He also has a phone number on his site that I texted.
[18:24.400 --> 18:25.580]  Haven't got a reply yet.
[18:25.700 --> 18:26.580]  I was asking if he had any.
[18:26.720 --> 18:27.740]  It might be. We should.
[18:27.840 --> 18:28.760]  It might be a landline.
[18:29.700 --> 18:30.040]  It could.
[18:30.680 --> 18:33.860]  Do you think it was just used to shoot commercials of people eating stuff?
[18:34.120 --> 18:35.520]  So he kept shooting people's mouths.
[18:35.860 --> 18:37.800]  His. He's like the Tarantino of mouths.
[18:39.480 --> 18:42.460]  I bet. I bet he insisted on the soul patch.
[18:42.680 --> 18:46.380]  He was probably like, no, the face needs the mouth area needs more action.
[18:46.560 --> 18:47.680]  We need we need to see more.
[18:49.940 --> 18:51.740]  Jackie Chan was like only for two scenes.
[18:52.140 --> 18:56.340]  The problem is he was a commercial director in the early 2000s,
[18:56.360 --> 18:59.060]  and those commercials are just generally fucking insane.
[18:59.080 --> 19:00.860]  But almost all of his work is absurd.
[19:01.540 --> 19:02.420]  It's ridiculous.
[19:03.100 --> 19:04.880]  I wonder if he'd want to do an interview with us
[19:04.880 --> 19:07.640]  about his experience on this movie and no other movies.
[19:08.320 --> 19:11.160]  Well, there's not there's no other movie for him to talk about.
[19:11.300 --> 19:14.840]  No, I want to talk to you about why he made no other movies. Yeah.
[19:16.300 --> 19:16.940]  Well, no, I think.
[19:16.940 --> 19:19.420]  Oh. Tuxedo moves.
[19:21.120 --> 19:23.020]  So like what are the logistics?
[19:23.260 --> 19:26.680]  It's pulling him right like he the tuxedo is doing
[19:26.680 --> 19:29.300]  like the movement of it is so baffling to me.
[19:29.560 --> 19:32.340]  I like that I was still on board for the movie at this point.
[19:37.300 --> 19:38.860]  That's fucking stupid...
[19:42.140 --> 19:43.300]  Looks so unnatural.
[19:43.940 --> 19:45.500]  What the hell is it made of?
[19:47.740 --> 19:51.940]  Also, is it the pants or is it only... is it only the top?
[19:53.680 --> 19:58.100]  It's got to be the pants and shoes. I think it's probably the entire
[19:59.420 --> 20:05.060]  titular tuxedo. Maybe not the socks. Don't you? Well, wait, at what point does the tuxedo end?
[20:05.680 --> 20:10.140]  When does the tuxedo end? I always kind of assume a tuxedo is the upper half.
[20:11.100 --> 20:14.760]  No, no, no, no. What? That's... no. Is a tuxedo a full outfit?
[20:15.860 --> 20:21.240]  Yes. If I rented a tux and I got half a tux for the wedding, I'd be pissed.
[20:23.300 --> 20:28.420]  Wait, he's a black jacket, asshole. Can he zoom out and show the... I think that what he's looking
[20:28.420 --> 20:32.380]  at is what I assumed a tuxedo was. I didn't think it went beyond that. I thought it was just that.
[20:32.500 --> 20:33.340]  I didn't know there was anything else. The collar?
[20:34.300 --> 20:37.980]  Well, like, no, not the collar, like the whole thing, the suit, like the jacket. I essentially
[20:37.980 --> 20:41.700]  thought a tuxedo was a jacket. I didn't know it was part of the entire outfit.
[20:44.360 --> 20:44.840]  Okay.
[20:47.480 --> 20:53.220]  That scene was edited insanely. I guess there are pants there. I'd love to ask him about it.
[20:54.100 --> 20:59.240]  This is what happens when you're not a pants guy. I just have no idea what's going on unless it's
[20:59.240 --> 21:05.700]  shorts and a shirt. I don't know. That's interesting. I wonder if it was just like
[21:06.300 --> 21:11.060]  the guy impressed the right person on a commercial shoot and then he just realized
[21:11.060 --> 21:15.260]  movies weren't for him. Like, he's like, I work better in 30 second increments or whatever.
[21:15.480 --> 21:20.540]  I remember early on, like around like season three of Red vs. Blue when we were making that,
[21:20.920 --> 21:24.840]  Bernie and Matt had me direct one episode and then that was it. Never again. They were like,
[21:24.920 --> 21:30.680]  yeah, this was a mistake. We're good. We got this. And I was like, yeah, I agree. Makes sense.
[21:39.240 --> 21:44.220]  I'm so happy. Oh, my God. It's a mission.
[21:49.380 --> 21:55.100]  Why would they have Burger King be their... well, money is the answer, but narratively, why?
[21:59.570 --> 22:05.050]  Does she decide what shift she works? Can he only accept missions on certain days?
[22:06.170 --> 22:12.250]  Does she set her... is the whole Burger King a front? Yeah, to do it properly, that special agent
[22:12.250 --> 22:17.670]  probably had to apply and get hired at that Burger King, work there long enough to become a shift
[22:17.670 --> 22:23.530]  lead. What? What? What are you talking about? Burger King, the lady that handed them the pizza.
[22:23.870 --> 22:29.010]  Sorry. No, no, no. You're right. I agree with you. This is what the what I'm watching is insane.
[22:29.490 --> 22:32.590]  We're going to sell one of these, right? Aren't we selling that skateboard? Yeah,
[22:32.610 --> 22:34.950]  they didn't want to do remote control or anything. They just
[22:34.950 --> 22:39.110]  told that skateboard to follow the giant flashing bomb looking thing.
[22:39.770 --> 22:44.070]  They told the skateboard to follow the most like the closest whopper available.
[22:44.070 --> 22:50.990]  And it's just whoppered in. I love the idea of sticking that on someone's back.
[22:54.890 --> 22:59.910]  Where do you guys land on Burger King as a restaurant? It's fine. I'm fine with it,
[22:59.930 --> 23:05.030]  to be honest. There's a lot of hatred for it. I'll get a whopper down. I'll get like an Angus
[23:05.030 --> 23:09.990]  burger down. I'm perfectly fine. My girlfriend hates it though. A Roadhouse King? Pretty good.
[23:10.590 --> 23:13.130]  I'm not I'm not a big whopper guy, but I enjoy the Roadhouse.
[23:13.130 --> 23:18.130]  That was a good burger. Yeah, I enjoyed the camera on the skateboard going into the car there. That
[23:18.130 --> 23:24.450]  was nice. But this one's again kind of feels very commercially to me, like you just got to appreciate
[23:24.450 --> 23:32.510]  the lack of shit. We should hire this guy to make the commercial for our robot skateboards.
[23:32.590 --> 23:42.350]  We sell. Oh, it was a bomb. I mean, surely they could have just put on the car.
[23:42.350 --> 23:50.350]  Why did they? What was the point of that? Yeah, like stick the bomb on the car. So there was
[23:50.350 --> 23:54.330]  the thing on the car, not a bomb then? It was just the thing on the skateboard. The thing on
[23:54.330 --> 23:59.050]  the skateboard was a mechanism to drive the skateboard to the car, I think. And then there
[23:59.050 --> 24:05.210]  was a bomb on top of the mechanism, I think. No, I think the skateboard was the bomb. Oh,
[24:05.270 --> 24:09.930]  no. And it was magnetically attracted to the mechanism. Oh, they got his head artery.
[24:15.620 --> 24:28.120]  What do you mean? Okay. Walter Strider. That's the link to the bug, like the war strider.
[24:30.060 --> 24:34.760]  There's somebody who watched this named Walter Strider. I was like, I have fun. No, I didn't do
[24:34.760 --> 24:49.200]  this. DILFER? If I was gonna have my name change at death, I would want it to land on DILFER.
[24:49.220 --> 25:05.720]  For sure. Is he dead? It's a good explosion. Did he kill Jason Isaacs? It was. No, he's not dead.
[25:21.930 --> 25:27.090]  Why does he care? Why is he involved? Why is he pursuing anything? He's a driver.
[25:27.090 --> 25:33.530]  Like, what is... I always feel bad for people doing stunts like that. That was an overall
[25:33.530 --> 25:37.530]  nothing stunt in the grand scheme of the movie, but I can imagine him having to do that like
[25:37.530 --> 25:42.670]  four or five times, and I bet it hurt on the fifth time. I bet it hurt every fucking time.
[25:43.890 --> 25:46.090]  And then you barely see it. Yeah.
[25:54.130 --> 25:57.090]  She actually thought it was a real hospital. She just showed up.
[26:14.470 --> 26:15.710]  Star of the movie.
[26:18.190 --> 26:21.730]  Did somebody write that? Is that in the script? Can we get the script? I want to
[26:21.730 --> 26:31.590]  know what this character's written words were. Seaway Queen. Banning Ink.
[26:32.470 --> 26:34.570]  Seagulls Crying would be a great name for a band.
[26:34.970 --> 26:41.590]  Can I just call my boat my headquarters? What's the rule? Is any inflatable
[26:41.590 --> 26:46.530]  floating headquarters if I want it to be? I think you can call your house your headquarters.
[26:47.530 --> 26:52.810]  Yeah. Like your room specifically. That's the Dark Knight guy. That guy.
[26:53.550 --> 26:59.410]  The Dark Knight guy? Stormhand! He's in the dark. He's the like Russian guy.
[26:59.770 --> 27:02.530]  That's not Christian Bale. No.
[27:04.810 --> 27:07.890]  You know the guy that is... they like light his money on fire?
[27:07.890 --> 27:15.490]  Tom Hardy? Yeah, the other one. Gavin, I would pay good money to see you have that haircut.
[27:16.510 --> 27:20.730]  I think I've had that haircut. I can whip you up a picture.
[27:21.690 --> 27:27.890]  Now, this is the first scene that we've seen so far that I remember. I remember this guy
[27:28.950 --> 27:34.230]  like dissolving or something. He dissolves? Doesn't he? Oh my god, I don't know.
[27:34.230 --> 27:38.830]  I watched this when I was like eight in a van. I don't remember this, but I'm excited.
[27:39.610 --> 27:42.910]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure he like gets so thirsty, he crumbles to dust.
[27:44.170 --> 27:50.010]  He does? Can I just ask a question? Of course. Is all this because of deer piss?
[27:50.990 --> 27:52.450]  Or did I miss something along the way?
[27:54.570 --> 27:58.270]  I don't think we can rule out that it isn't. I don't think they've established that it's not.
[27:59.230 --> 28:01.170]  I don't think it is, but I can't say it's not.
[28:02.250 --> 28:06.030]  Okay. Oh, he's looking happy. Oh, Jesus Christ, he is dusting.
[28:14.280 --> 28:18.600]  Peter Stormare is such a great mad scientist. He's great at everything.
[28:19.260 --> 28:21.420]  This is quite a lot of hair for a Stormare appearance.
[28:21.760 --> 28:27.040]  It is. He played the devil in Constantine. It was like the coolest fucking devil ever.
[28:27.040 --> 28:33.040]  Oh, yeah. That had a similar scene, didn't it? Like a guy drowning,
[28:33.180 --> 28:35.620]  but he couldn't drink or something? Something like that, yeah.
[28:35.620 --> 28:36.840]  Jesus Christ.
[28:39.480 --> 28:41.440]  Oh, fuck. Well, that's not what you want.
[28:41.700 --> 28:47.520]  He did get dusted. What the fuck? Oh, Jesus Christ.
[28:50.520 --> 28:53.820]  He snapped a guy's hand and down the lengthways.
[28:56.360 --> 29:00.540]  So you don't remember that? No, I don't.
[29:01.720 --> 29:03.600]  Was that George Stephanopoulos?
[29:03.600 --> 29:07.920]  He's got famous names. Springsteen, Steinbrenner, Stephanopoulos.
[29:09.580 --> 29:14.880]  Strider. What if this whole movie was him never actually figuring out what
[29:14.880 --> 29:18.160]  he was supposed to look for? This is the pursuit of Walter Strider.
[29:21.900 --> 29:27.320]  So the idea there, that guy was making a brand of water that makes people thirsty. Is that right?
[29:27.620 --> 29:31.180]  Is that what he was going for? Well, I guess, yeah. And at the extreme,
[29:31.180 --> 29:37.060]  you would eventually die from it, right? I don't know if he's trying to sell his water or kill
[29:37.060 --> 29:39.780]  people. No, I think he's killing people. I think killing people is the goal.
[29:39.980 --> 29:42.880]  Okay. Maybe this is the story of Dasani.
[29:45.700 --> 29:50.380]  This is what the Walmart people want to do. They get the reservoir or whatever.
[29:50.500 --> 29:52.040]  Oh, montage. What?
[29:52.180 --> 29:56.260]  Oh, it does its own pants up. I really like the idea that he saw
[29:56.260 --> 30:00.300]  Back to the Future and was like, no, guys, listen, we don't need to stop at the shoes.
[30:00.300 --> 30:03.620]  Hear me out. I still thought this was a good movie.
[30:03.840 --> 30:07.120]  What the fuck? I mean, I don't hate this.
[30:07.420 --> 30:11.340]  Ow! I would buy this product.
[30:11.900 --> 30:15.480]  Did he just get pricked with a million internal needles?
[30:16.020 --> 30:17.820]  I think shocked. I don't know if they pricked...
[30:17.820 --> 30:22.180]  Oh, that explains how it can, like, control his fingers and stuff.
[30:22.280 --> 30:27.400]  Yeah. This is actually terrifying. You lose complete free will as soon as you put this
[30:27.400 --> 30:29.240]  tuxedo on. It's like Dr. Ock.
[30:30.180 --> 30:32.900]  Do you think the name for the movie came before the plot?
[30:33.060 --> 30:36.700]  Like, somebody said Tux. And they came up with the acronym.
[30:36.800 --> 30:38.580]  They're like, we should make a fucking movie about that.
[30:38.900 --> 30:40.480]  That's a James Bond shit. Yeah.
[30:40.580 --> 30:44.440]  I think somebody at DreamWorks was looking through a list of titles they already had
[30:44.440 --> 30:46.540]  the rights to and then had to write around that.
[30:50.340 --> 30:51.980]  He's in demolition mode.
[30:54.720 --> 30:57.360]  Did demolition mode mean something else in 2002?
[30:57.800 --> 31:01.340]  Because this is not... This is like a pre-programmed routine.
[31:07.980 --> 31:10.680]  This was the day they couldn't afford to fly the stunt team over.
[31:13.780 --> 31:15.640]  Oh, how fast was that ball?
[31:16.300 --> 31:18.820]  Was yours faster, Geoff? You think you could out-gear Jack and Chad?
[31:18.920 --> 31:20.080]  That was a slow throw.
[31:21.380 --> 31:23.840]  Also, it wouldn't be him throwing it, it'd be the suit, so it wouldn't count.
[31:24.340 --> 31:24.700]  That's true.
[31:28.810 --> 31:34.030]  Also, wait till I solve this spinal arthritis and then I'm gonna be throwing heat.
[31:38.980 --> 31:41.940]  I like that the government suit has a shake booty,
[31:42.080 --> 31:45.400]  like out of all the things they could have named it, they settled on that.
[31:45.660 --> 31:47.160]  I want to be in the group meeting.
[31:47.500 --> 31:49.940]  Oh, one sec, I gotta... He's gotta go get his FedEx.
[31:50.140 --> 31:50.620]  Yeah, we'll just...
[31:50.620 --> 31:51.620]  Nah, he'll come back.
[31:51.660 --> 31:51.920]  We can recap him.
[31:52.540 --> 31:54.780]  So he's got this thing dialed up to 10, right?
[31:54.860 --> 31:57.140]  Like, if he did... If he rolled it back to like 6,
[31:57.140 --> 32:00.700]  would he do a less enthusiastic, like, normal dance?
[32:02.220 --> 32:03.880]  I... To what range?
[32:04.620 --> 32:05.860]  Yeah, like, what is the...
[32:06.380 --> 32:08.020]  Because it seems like it's just on max.
[32:09.420 --> 32:11.480]  I don't... Have they established that there are different ranges?
[32:11.960 --> 32:14.440]  I don't know, man, but who wants to ever dance like that?
[32:15.320 --> 32:16.500]  Like, to that degree.
[32:16.780 --> 32:19.700]  Whoever owns that suit, I guess, or whoever made it, whatever...
[32:19.700 --> 32:22.380]  The CWA, or whatever their fake agency is.
[32:22.620 --> 32:22.940]  CSA.
[32:22.940 --> 32:23.220]  CSA.
[32:24.020 --> 32:24.860]  That's close.
[32:29.580 --> 32:31.580]  Is this Jennifer Love Hewitt at her peak?
[32:32.020 --> 32:33.380]  Or is this, like, right before it?
[32:35.600 --> 32:35.900]  Um...
[32:35.900 --> 32:36.600]  That's 2002.
[32:38.020 --> 32:41.420]  She was on top of the world there, uh, from, like,
[32:41.500 --> 32:44.120]  I Know What You Did Last Summer, all the way up till she had that show,
[32:44.800 --> 32:47.220]  where she was, like, the jack-off masseuse, right?
[32:47.680 --> 32:50.700]  Was that pre or... pre or after the, uh, the ghost one?
[32:51.340 --> 32:52.840]  She was... The Ghost Whisperer 2.
[32:53.340 --> 32:54.860]  I don't know what order they came in.
[32:55.320 --> 32:57.940]  I think it was... I think the... I think that was after.
[32:57.940 --> 32:59.500]  Or was it both?
[32:59.660 --> 33:03.560]  Was she a jerk-off massage person who also spoke the ghosts?
[33:06.380 --> 33:07.520]  It's a multi-hyphenate.
[33:07.980 --> 33:09.440]  Yeah, they learned in season three.
[33:09.780 --> 33:10.200]  It really...
[33:10.200 --> 33:13.200]  I would also say that I think that she's one of those people that, like,
[33:13.240 --> 33:17.120]  is probably still, like, as famous as ever.
[33:17.360 --> 33:17.600]  Right?
[33:17.780 --> 33:19.600]  And so, like, it's still kind of at her peak.
[33:19.680 --> 33:21.700]  Like, I think she still works whenever she wants to.
[33:26.610 --> 33:27.770]  What was the... what was the...
[33:28.590 --> 33:29.750]  He said, nice rack.
[33:29.750 --> 33:31.130]  Oh, great.
[33:31.790 --> 33:32.650]  She punched him.
[33:32.730 --> 33:34.170]  But it wasn't him. It was probably the suit.
[33:34.390 --> 33:35.670]  Or it was the deer piss talking.
[33:39.650 --> 33:42.170]  The deer actually has top billing on IMDb.
[33:45.570 --> 33:47.190]  Gavin, are you still in at this point?
[33:48.510 --> 33:48.970]  No, he's gone.
[33:50.490 --> 33:52.650]  He's... he went to sign for his FedEx package.
[33:53.070 --> 33:55.470]  He... what he forgot to mention was that it's not at his house.
[33:55.530 --> 33:56.730]  He has to take an Uber to FedEx.
[33:58.070 --> 34:02.690]  This was... this is all an elaborate scheme by Gavin to just make us watch the tuxedo.
[34:03.190 --> 34:05.810]  He's on his... he's on his way to eat dinner right now.
[34:05.910 --> 34:09.250]  That was... Meg was texting him the reservation time.
[34:11.810 --> 34:13.730]  He's being seated for sushi.
[34:20.550 --> 34:21.690]  That's a nice car, though.
[34:22.190 --> 34:22.570]  It is.
[34:23.330 --> 34:24.810]  And, you know, it's a nice tuxedo.
[34:26.030 --> 34:27.310]  They did a good job with that.
[34:27.310 --> 34:28.350]  You think...
[34:30.770 --> 34:31.570]  Where... so...
[34:32.030 --> 34:33.790]  What do you think a tuxedo is now?
[34:33.890 --> 34:34.690]  Have you changed your opinion?
[34:34.870 --> 34:37.510]  Now... yeah, now I... I understand it's the pants as well.
[34:38.190 --> 34:40.570]  Before, I thought it was just everything above the pants.
[34:40.890 --> 34:41.990]  Do you think it's also the shirt?
[34:43.030 --> 34:46.070]  Yeah, the shirt... I assumed it was the shirt and the... the coat.
[34:46.210 --> 34:47.250]  The jacket was what a tuxedo is.
[34:47.250 --> 34:48.790]  The cummerbund, if there is one.
[34:49.030 --> 34:50.010]  And, uh, yeah.
[34:51.410 --> 34:54.130]  Have you ever... have you ever worn a tuxedo, Andrew?
[34:54.130 --> 34:55.570]  No. Uh, yes.
[34:55.630 --> 34:56.670]  When I was like five.
[34:56.670 --> 34:58.530]  I was the ring bearer to a wedding.
[34:58.650 --> 35:00.990]  And I think I wore a tux and that.
[35:02.410 --> 35:07.090]  Fucking... the only one that I've ever worn was, uh, our friend Gus Sorolla.
[35:07.350 --> 35:10.290]  When he got married, he, as a... just to be a dick,
[35:10.590 --> 35:14.730]  he made all of his groomsmen wear powder blue, ruffly tuxedos.
[35:15.570 --> 35:15.990]  Yeah.
[35:16.630 --> 35:17.770]  You didn't pause it.
[35:18.730 --> 35:20.310]  What were we supposed to?
[35:20.550 --> 35:22.150]  Yeah, were we supposed to pause it?
[35:22.430 --> 35:23.570]  Well, my FedEx thing was there.
[35:23.610 --> 35:24.930]  I thought you paused it.
[35:24.930 --> 35:25.330]  What?
[35:27.730 --> 35:29.030]  Why would we pause this?
[35:29.050 --> 35:30.450]  Why would we pause this?
[35:30.730 --> 35:32.390]  We had a whole thing.
[35:32.530 --> 35:34.730]  We had to figure out how we were starting it back up earlier.
[35:35.030 --> 35:35.710]  Yeah, dude.
[35:35.790 --> 35:40.630]  Also, we were pretty sure that this was all a ploy to get us to watch the movie
[35:40.630 --> 35:42.030]  while you went and had sushi with Meg.
[35:42.090 --> 35:42.250]  Yeah.
[35:42.930 --> 35:43.450]  Oh, no.
[35:43.830 --> 35:46.670]  Oh, I might have missed the bit where I thought it was the worst.
[35:47.130 --> 35:48.210]  Oh, that's what I asked.
[35:48.290 --> 35:49.870]  I asked, like, and you were gone.
[35:49.930 --> 35:51.390]  I said, are you still in at this point?
[35:51.950 --> 35:53.750]  So he called her and she's like,
[35:54.050 --> 35:57.070]  stop using that accent to who she thought was Jason Isaacs.
[35:57.150 --> 36:00.190]  Then Jackie Chan said a woman has a nice rack and got punched.
[36:00.530 --> 36:03.050]  And then he drove over here is all you've missed.
[36:03.530 --> 36:04.530]  Yeah, you didn't miss much.
[36:04.870 --> 36:07.130]  No, like, essentially nothing has happened.
[36:08.370 --> 36:09.210]  He's got...
[36:09.210 --> 36:11.870]  I just want them to go through and show everything that it could do.
[36:11.930 --> 36:12.870]  I want every setting.
[36:15.150 --> 36:16.950]  You think this is the inspiration for the Apple Watch?
[36:17.110 --> 36:17.710]  They saw this?
[36:17.710 --> 36:21.490]  Wasn't this like a Blumhouse movie recently or A24, one of those?
[36:23.150 --> 36:23.850]  The tuxedo?
[36:23.930 --> 36:24.490]  Like, what do you mean?
[36:24.570 --> 36:28.710]  No, like some dude who had like a super body that he almost died and then...
[36:28.710 --> 36:29.270]  This sucks.
[36:29.570 --> 36:30.430]  And then he could do shit.
[36:31.010 --> 36:31.630]  Upgrade, yeah.
[36:32.630 --> 36:37.690]  I like this is also just a preset in the thing, like specifically rifle cleaning mode.
[36:38.090 --> 36:41.770]  I also feel like it would be cooler to just watch him do it than what they just did.
[36:41.930 --> 36:44.090]  Like that was the lamest version of that action.
[36:45.870 --> 36:46.470]  I agree.
[36:48.570 --> 36:49.270]  What is it?
[36:50.850 --> 36:52.150]  It's a... what is it?
[36:52.150 --> 36:52.730]  It's a gun?
[36:53.170 --> 36:53.850]  Or it's a camera?
[36:55.650 --> 36:56.470]  Oh, it's a gun.
[36:56.590 --> 36:56.810]  Okay.
[36:58.910 --> 37:00.510]  All right, that was funny.
[37:00.990 --> 37:01.870]  That was really funny.
[37:02.450 --> 37:05.650]  The way the camera flipped, it looked like he was falling upwards.
[37:06.290 --> 37:07.550]  It's such a weird edit.
[37:07.830 --> 37:08.830]  Rifle tricks!
[37:09.770 --> 37:10.610]  Rifle tricks!
[37:10.950 --> 37:11.610]  Rifle tricks!
[37:12.130 --> 37:12.410]  Rifle tricks!
[37:13.030 --> 37:13.310]  Oh!
[37:14.290 --> 37:17.890]  Oh, shit!
[37:18.570 --> 37:19.150]  What's great?
[37:19.950 --> 37:24.590]  The thing that's important to remember is Jackie Chan has as much knowledge as we do
[37:24.590 --> 37:25.790]  about what these things do.
[37:25.850 --> 37:28.030]  He's got no concept of what's going on.
[37:29.490 --> 37:30.490]  Rifle tricks!
[37:33.270 --> 37:34.930]  Should have been called that in Argentina.
[37:39.090 --> 37:39.650]  Oh.
[37:43.780 --> 37:44.640]  Is that true?
[37:44.640 --> 37:45.120]  That stat?
[37:46.580 --> 37:47.680]  I can look it up.
[37:47.760 --> 37:49.600]  How much bottled water was consumed in 2001?
[37:49.620 --> 37:52.280]  If I was like the first person on earth and I was just looking at all the water,
[37:52.380 --> 37:54.460]  I wouldn't think like that's where the value is.
[37:56.160 --> 37:56.840]  Storing it.
[37:59.420 --> 38:01.000]  How much water?
[38:08.500 --> 38:11.940]  Jackie Chan standing there with a tuxedo and a rifle is very funny.
[38:15.580 --> 38:16.720]  Did that guy die then?
[38:16.800 --> 38:17.920]  The guy that got hit in the head?
[38:18.260 --> 38:19.660]  I believe so, yeah.
[38:19.660 --> 38:21.000]  It's a funny trick.
[38:22.820 --> 38:25.120]  Is this the highest body count Jackie Chan movie?
[38:29.740 --> 38:31.720]  I like that he had no reaction to it.
[38:31.780 --> 38:33.140]  He's a taxi driver.
[38:33.500 --> 38:34.620]  He just killed a guy.
[38:36.440 --> 38:38.620]  He had no like moral impact on him.
[38:41.340 --> 38:45.180]  Man, he should be feeling lucky that he's not drowning in a bag right now.
[38:45.680 --> 38:46.800]  Was he on wires there?
[38:48.040 --> 38:49.680]  No, he could really do all that.
[38:50.760 --> 38:51.500]  I would have thought so.
[38:51.500 --> 38:52.640]  That is awesome.
[38:52.980 --> 38:53.840]  That is very cool.
[39:00.440 --> 39:04.940]  Dude, Jackie Chan at this point we determined earlier is 48, I believe.
[39:05.300 --> 39:07.280]  I am 46.
[39:08.020 --> 39:09.640]  I can't ride a bicycle anymore.
[39:12.320 --> 39:13.360]  God damn.
[39:16.580 --> 39:20.140]  I feel like this movie should have more of Jackie Chan just being like,
[39:20.240 --> 39:21.540]  what the fuck am I doing?
[39:21.940 --> 39:23.180]  Because like this isn't him.
[39:23.180 --> 39:26.480]  I mean, there's moments of that last bit where he was against the pipe.
[39:26.660 --> 39:28.480]  His face was like, what's going on?
[39:29.360 --> 39:33.040]  But he kind of has like a playful confidence because he's Jackie Chan,
[39:33.120 --> 39:36.620]  where if I was in the scenario, I'd just be screaming the entire time
[39:36.620 --> 39:37.900]  my body did all the actions.
[39:38.760 --> 39:39.540]  There would be no shit.
[39:46.360 --> 39:47.600]  62 year old wrote that.
[39:47.960 --> 39:49.340]  Does that really last you, Gavin?
[39:50.340 --> 39:51.520]  No, I'm still in, I think.
[39:53.320 --> 39:55.720]  Well, when you have a pre-order, it's really tough to...
[39:55.720 --> 39:58.000]  It really has to fall to be like, this was...
[39:59.640 --> 40:00.260]  This didn't go away.
[40:00.260 --> 40:02.320]  Jackie Chan's the king of prop fighting.
[40:02.840 --> 40:06.340]  There's always like someone's jacket or a rope or like to a car.
[40:07.000 --> 40:08.300]  Did you see Skip Trace?
[40:10.180 --> 40:10.620]  No.
[40:11.040 --> 40:14.020]  Skip Trace is the movie he made with Johnny Knoxville.
[40:14.560 --> 40:16.440]  Only good thing about it is the prop fighting.
[40:16.980 --> 40:19.580]  He's got this great scene where he's holding like a Russian doll.
[40:19.700 --> 40:22.080]  And every time it gets punched, it gets smaller until he's just like
[40:22.080 --> 40:23.140]  holding this really tiny thing.
[40:23.180 --> 40:24.340]  It's a really great visual gig.
[40:24.940 --> 40:27.780]  Johnny Knoxville might be the guy who I like the most.
[40:27.880 --> 40:32.060]  And I want to see succeed in film the most who continually makes the worst movies.
[40:32.440 --> 40:34.100]  You say that about like succeeding.
[40:34.460 --> 40:36.900]  I thought I was like, oh, nobody saw Skip Trace.
[40:37.020 --> 40:39.660]  It made a thousand dollars in the domestic box office.
[40:39.780 --> 40:42.040]  It made 132 million worldwide.
[40:42.520 --> 40:43.640]  It was a massive hit.
[40:44.700 --> 40:45.200]  Oh, quick.
[40:47.520 --> 40:49.020]  Shake your booty.
[40:49.240 --> 40:50.040]  Shake booty.
[40:54.340 --> 40:55.500]  What is this? Is this default?
[40:55.660 --> 40:56.720]  The suit just does this?
[40:56.960 --> 40:57.280]  Okay.
[40:59.180 --> 41:00.520]  What was on his hand?
[41:00.620 --> 41:01.300]  What is that?
[41:01.840 --> 41:03.220]  Is it like goo?
[41:03.420 --> 41:04.480]  Oh, it's like a...
[41:04.480 --> 41:05.980]  Oh, the suit.
[41:06.220 --> 41:07.180]  I think he shot that out.
[41:07.920 --> 41:08.320]  It's a magnet.
[41:08.340 --> 41:10.500]  He's Spider-Man now, yeah.
[41:14.800 --> 41:17.780]  Dude, imagine a Jackie Chan Spider-Man in the 70s.
[41:18.220 --> 41:18.980]  It's sick.
[41:19.440 --> 41:20.320]  Spider-Chan.
[41:21.000 --> 41:21.820]  He would have hated it.
[41:26.060 --> 41:27.780]  I bet he could still do it.
[41:32.330 --> 41:36.250]  All he wanted to do was serious dramas, which makes his career really funny in America.
[41:36.690 --> 41:40.470]  He's like, I just want to make a movie like Kramer versus Kramer and they won't let me.
[41:41.110 --> 41:45.110]  Have you ever seen his like original martial arts movies, like Drunken Master and stuff?
[41:46.070 --> 41:47.530]  I've seen a few of them as a kid.
[41:47.610 --> 41:48.650]  Yeah, but not at all.
[41:48.970 --> 41:49.030]  So good.
[41:49.530 --> 41:50.050]  Even then.
[41:50.370 --> 41:52.670]  Yeah, I feel like I haven't seen like his super old stuff.
[41:52.930 --> 41:55.110]  I've probably seen from like Police Story onwards.
[41:56.970 --> 42:01.890]  They used to, um, there was like when I was a kid, there was on the, I would say it was
[42:01.890 --> 42:02.450]  a USA channel.
[42:02.530 --> 42:06.050]  They would have like Sunday morning Kung Fu theater and they would have like three Kung
[42:06.050 --> 42:06.870]  Fu movies back to back.
[42:06.930 --> 42:08.010]  And he was always one of them.
[42:08.590 --> 42:09.710]  Oh, is he going to get the owie hands?
[42:14.630 --> 42:16.230]  Oh, he's going to get owie hands at the bottom.
[42:17.070 --> 42:17.190]  Ow.
[42:22.170 --> 42:23.150]  No, there's no owie.
[42:23.450 --> 42:24.330]  It's the tuxedo.
[42:26.410 --> 42:27.270]  It was a little bit.
[42:28.890 --> 42:31.470]  Would you say that was the weakest of his owie hand performances?
[42:31.590 --> 42:34.850]  Maybe it's because you're expecting it and then there's no owie hands because of the
[42:34.850 --> 42:35.950]  amazing tuxedo.
[42:38.730 --> 42:41.730]  So like, once again, does he know how to do this?
[42:41.910 --> 42:42.970]  Is this the tuxedo?
[42:44.050 --> 42:46.090]  I think this is all him.
[42:46.730 --> 42:50.830]  I bet you 90% of the people that own Hooters shirts can also do this.
[42:50.910 --> 42:52.430]  I think it's a weird cross section.
[42:52.610 --> 42:55.770]  You should have just scrolled to shadow tricks instead of rifle tricks.
[42:57.070 --> 42:59.130]  He's a huge frowey snitch.
[42:59.430 --> 43:02.270]  Jackie Chan ever fought so many inanimate objects in one movie?
[43:03.230 --> 43:04.470]  He had a whole fight with a real building.
[43:04.930 --> 43:05.650]  He decided to attack.
[43:13.740 --> 43:15.120]  How far into this are we?
[43:18.260 --> 43:19.200]  We're halfway.
[43:20.140 --> 43:20.660]  Wow.
[43:21.300 --> 43:22.720]  I feel like nothing has happened.
[43:23.440 --> 43:24.980]  Gavin is still in at this point.
[43:25.680 --> 43:26.420]  Hold on.
[43:27.160 --> 43:27.760]  Hold on.
[43:33.990 --> 43:35.590]  Getting flashbacks to when I was younger.
[43:36.090 --> 43:38.450]  Hold on, hold on.
[43:38.790 --> 43:40.270]  And this movie sucks.
[43:47.450 --> 43:49.090]  I was out from that point.
[43:57.690 --> 44:01.410]  After you have that moment and then you, I guess, finish the film,
[44:01.510 --> 44:04.470]  what do you do with the DVD you just saved up to buy and pre-order?
[44:05.130 --> 44:07.730]  Oh, I bet it was like 18 quid as well back then.
[44:07.870 --> 44:07.990]  Yeah.
[44:08.350 --> 44:11.070]  Did you, like, does it go in a drawer or do you return it?
[44:12.190 --> 44:14.430]  Uh, probably just, I think I put it on the shelf.
[44:15.030 --> 44:15.590]  That was probably it.
[44:16.290 --> 44:16.570]  Yeah.
[44:17.210 --> 44:19.150]  Is this how you felt when you watched the number 23?
[44:21.330 --> 44:23.010]  I watched that at your house, so you paid for it.
[44:26.270 --> 44:27.710]  Were you excited about the number 23?
[44:30.150 --> 44:36.010]  We, he loves, he, uh, he really loves, uh, I can't think of his name either.
[44:36.310 --> 44:36.710]  Jim Carrey.
[44:37.870 --> 44:40.170]  Yeah, the arthritis is, it's getting into my brain.
[44:41.150 --> 44:45.110]  He loves Jim Carrey and had never seen a bad Jim Carrey film.
[44:45.430 --> 44:46.670]  And I was like, I've seen one.
[44:46.950 --> 44:48.250]  And so he was like, it's not possible.
[44:48.410 --> 44:50.150]  And so we had a whole conversation about it.
[44:50.150 --> 44:51.390]  So then I rented it so he could see it.
[44:51.450 --> 44:52.910]  And then, uh, then he got to see.
[44:54.090 --> 44:56.810]  And then you convinced me that Ace Ventura 2 was also a bad one.
[44:56.810 --> 44:57.730]  It is.
[44:58.270 --> 44:58.430]  Yep.
[45:03.650 --> 45:07.690]  So if you went to court for something, he did in the tuxedo and the tuxedo did it.
[45:08.130 --> 45:08.830]  Is he still liable?
[45:10.610 --> 45:11.050]  Uh.
[45:12.190 --> 45:14.030]  Could he use the tuxedo as a defense?
[45:14.690 --> 45:16.150]  I think it's like lawyer mode.
[45:16.270 --> 45:19.190]  I mean, I would think it never mind.
[45:19.610 --> 45:20.110]  Gavin's right.
[45:21.770 --> 45:25.410]  That's way, that was way funnier and more appropriate than all the political jokes.
[45:25.490 --> 45:26.010]  I was about to make.
[45:26.090 --> 45:27.210]  So thank you.
[45:38.980 --> 45:41.080]  I feel like I haven't seen her in a lot of movies.
[45:42.020 --> 45:42.200]  Who?
[45:42.440 --> 45:43.100]  Jennifer Love Hewitt?
[45:43.420 --> 45:43.660]  Yeah.
[45:44.240 --> 45:46.540]  While you were away, we had a whole thing about her career.
[45:47.240 --> 45:48.340]  It's been a ton of stuff.
[45:48.960 --> 45:52.280]  I think she has like, like a few kids now.
[45:52.720 --> 45:55.400]  So she probably just, you know, raising kids.
[45:55.540 --> 46:01.680]  She, she was famous for, uh, getting engaged and breaking off engagements to people.
[46:02.580 --> 46:03.440]  Or just getting rings.
[46:04.280 --> 46:04.840]  I guess so.
[46:04.900 --> 46:05.760]  Yeah, she did that a lot.
[46:06.320 --> 46:07.460]  I think she was the one.
[46:07.720 --> 46:09.660]  I think I also had from everything I remember.
[46:09.840 --> 46:12.320]  There was a guy on the Howard Stern show that was engaged to her for a while.
[46:12.700 --> 46:14.480]  I think she always wore the pants in the family.
[46:14.600 --> 46:16.260]  I think she was the tended.
[46:16.400 --> 46:16.980]  Oh, my Lord.
[46:17.560 --> 46:21.180]  Tended to do the, uh, uh, engaging.
[46:24.460 --> 46:28.240]  She was in the Ghost Whisperer from 2005 through 2010.
[46:28.720 --> 46:29.920]  It's a great business to be in.
[46:30.820 --> 46:34.380]  There's never not like if you can whisper to ghosts, what a great industry.
[46:35.140 --> 46:36.840]  There's never going to stop being ghosts.
[46:36.840 --> 46:38.800]  Yeah, every day, new ghosts.
[46:40.860 --> 46:42.560]  Uh, let's see what she's done recently.
[46:43.760 --> 46:47.720]  Dude, they should bring that show back and do like Ghost Whisperer COVID days.
[46:51.540 --> 46:54.790]  I feel like Ghost Whisperer would just be an ASMR channel now.
[47:07.110 --> 47:12.030]  I just went to her Instagram and she has a post from November 23rd saying,
[47:12.430 --> 47:14.050]  it was such an honor to be a part of this movie.
[47:14.130 --> 47:15.170]  My kids are so proud of me.
[47:15.270 --> 47:16.010]  Please check it out.
[47:16.450 --> 47:19.310]  They bark, they bite, they booby trap, burglars beware.
[47:19.530 --> 47:24.230]  And it's a movie called Pups Alone starring Danny Trejo and Malcolm McDowell.
[47:24.230 --> 47:25.550]  So Andrew's immediately.
[47:26.310 --> 47:26.750]  Okay.
[47:27.210 --> 47:28.590]  I thank you for bringing up Trejo.
[47:28.690 --> 47:32.150]  The guy that directed this made a pilot called What Would Trejo Do?
[47:32.570 --> 47:33.470]  In 2017.
[47:33.890 --> 47:35.070]  It is horrendous.
[47:35.310 --> 47:36.930]  One of the worst things I've ever seen.
[47:37.490 --> 47:37.930]  What would he do?
[47:38.130 --> 47:38.350]  Very weird.
[47:39.170 --> 47:41.610]  Well, what's weird is he's the one saying it.
[47:41.710 --> 47:42.730]  Like something would happen.
[47:42.910 --> 47:44.290]  Like he's getting arrested.
[47:44.430 --> 47:46.550]  He's like, it's times like these, I would say.
[47:46.650 --> 47:47.770]  What would Danny do?
[47:48.250 --> 47:51.230]  I know what machete would do, but what would I do?
[47:51.350 --> 47:53.130]  And then he does the thing that he would do.
[47:53.170 --> 47:54.010]  It makes no sense.
[47:54.010 --> 47:54.730]  It's terrible.
[47:56.010 --> 47:57.430]  Where did you watch this?
[47:57.930 --> 48:00.270]  I found the director has a...
[48:01.070 --> 48:01.770]  Oh, what's the...
[48:01.770 --> 48:02.390]  It's not YouTube.
[48:02.510 --> 48:04.170]  It's like Vimeo, I think.
[48:04.530 --> 48:05.550]  Is it Vimeo is on?
[48:05.650 --> 48:05.790]  Yeah.
[48:06.230 --> 48:06.570]  I don't know.
[48:06.650 --> 48:07.430]  We should watch that.
[48:07.610 --> 48:08.810]  It is so bad.
[48:09.470 --> 48:09.850]  Do you...
[48:09.850 --> 48:10.490]  Let me ask you a question.
[48:10.590 --> 48:13.510]  We're now halfway through this steaming pile of film.
[48:14.990 --> 48:18.290]  Would you say this is something we're going to do again in the future?
[48:19.290 --> 48:21.630]  I mean, I wouldn't be opposed.
[48:22.190 --> 48:22.530]  This is fine.
[48:22.710 --> 48:22.970]  I'm sorry.
[48:22.970 --> 48:24.270]  I like watching movies.
[48:24.370 --> 48:25.550]  I'm enjoying it, too.
[48:26.230 --> 48:30.490]  Well, I think that we, once again, you know, I'm all up on the happy days front,
[48:30.670 --> 48:34.250]  but I think watching a Danny Trejo pilot sounds like an awesome idea.
[48:35.130 --> 48:36.650]  I don't like...
[48:37.530 --> 48:38.330]  I don't know.
[48:38.830 --> 48:39.070]  Maybe.
[48:39.230 --> 48:39.870]  Like, yes.
[48:40.030 --> 48:40.870]  You suggested it.
[48:41.190 --> 48:41.610]  I know.
[48:41.710 --> 48:43.450]  I didn't suggest it for content.
[48:43.870 --> 48:45.190]  I don't know if it's content.
[48:45.650 --> 48:50.470]  Andrew's iffy on Trejo, I feel like, because you did say he never escalates anything he's in.
[48:50.630 --> 48:51.330]  Or he never...
[48:51.830 --> 48:52.590]  What were you saying?
[48:53.210 --> 48:57.070]  He's very likable, but I don't feel like you're ever excited that he's in it.
[48:57.150 --> 48:57.590]  But he's good.
[48:58.150 --> 48:59.630]  Are we keying in?
[48:59.730 --> 49:02.090]  Are you feuding with Danny Trejo right now?
[49:02.190 --> 49:02.930]  Do you guys have beef?
[49:03.490 --> 49:04.250]  No, I love Danny.
[49:04.410 --> 49:05.350]  It's either I...
[49:05.350 --> 49:07.090]  It's Peter Stormare or Danny Trejo in my life.
[49:07.090 --> 49:07.770]  You don't sound like you love him.
[49:08.250 --> 49:08.590]  Sounds like you're pretty disappointed in him.
[49:08.590 --> 49:10.090]  He just got re-added to Far Cry 6.
[49:11.070 --> 49:12.310]  I have no issue with Danny Trejo.
[49:14.430 --> 49:17.130]  I feel like they've really loaded in on like...
[49:17.130 --> 49:17.870]  Jesus Christ.
[49:18.010 --> 49:18.690]  Oh my God.
[49:18.690 --> 49:23.370]  All these gormless dudes just stared at her ass and tits every 10 seconds.
[49:23.530 --> 49:23.710]  Terrible.
[49:24.930 --> 49:26.650]  I don't like it.
[49:27.610 --> 49:29.480]  And she was engaged to all of them.
[49:31.150 --> 49:33.010]  And she broke it off with all of them.
[49:33.170 --> 49:33.630]  James Brown!
[49:33.770 --> 49:34.750]  Oh, it's James Brown.
[49:35.090 --> 49:36.350]  His last film appearance.
[49:37.010 --> 49:38.010]  The Godfather of Soul.
[49:39.670 --> 49:43.790]  James Brown, one of the funniest interviews of all time.
[49:44.110 --> 49:44.490]  Really?
[49:45.050 --> 49:45.870]  Oh my God.
[49:45.970 --> 49:48.790]  Go back and watch any of his classic CNN stuff.
[49:49.010 --> 49:50.010]  Losing his mind.
[49:50.170 --> 49:52.390]  Being fucking on another planet.
[49:53.030 --> 49:55.470]  People just having no concept of what he's talking about.
[49:55.550 --> 49:56.390]  He was awesome.
[49:56.830 --> 49:57.710]  He's just a guy...
[49:58.450 --> 50:00.970]  He's just got a lot to say, but you don't know what it is.
[50:01.190 --> 50:01.850]  And he's just gonna...
[50:01.850 --> 50:02.670]  Boy, he's gonna say it.
[50:03.190 --> 50:05.430]  And he's gonna say it enthusiastically.
[50:10.980 --> 50:12.580]  We're not back in at that!
[50:12.940 --> 50:15.480]  Oh my God!
[50:18.830 --> 50:19.710]  He also...
[50:21.130 --> 50:23.170]  James Brown in a commercial with Danny Trejo.
[50:23.430 --> 50:24.770]  I think the greatest commercial of all time.
[50:25.510 --> 50:26.250]  What's the commercial for?
[50:26.810 --> 50:27.250]  It's...
[50:27.250 --> 50:28.810]  It was a car commercial with Clive Owen.
[50:29.070 --> 50:32.410]  And it's about James Brown made a deal with the devil to become famous.
[50:32.430 --> 50:34.110]  And the devil's played by Gary Oldman.
[50:34.370 --> 50:39.030]  And Clive Owen and James Brown raced the devil played by Gary Oldman and Danny Trejo.
[50:39.670 --> 50:41.170]  To make him young again.
[50:41.630 --> 50:44.130]  And if not, then he like forfeits his soul forever.
[50:44.730 --> 50:47.610]  That is a star-studded AAA commercial.
[50:48.110 --> 50:48.570]  It's great.
[50:48.650 --> 50:50.030]  It's like early 2000s.
[50:50.030 --> 50:50.830]  It's fantastic.
[50:51.590 --> 50:53.190]  Didn't when James...
[50:53.190 --> 50:55.190]  I'm gonna guess Eric's gonna know about this.
[50:55.630 --> 51:00.010]  When James Brown died, wasn't there like a thing where they were fighting over his body?
[51:00.230 --> 51:02.670]  And so he didn't get buried for like six months or something?
[51:03.230 --> 51:03.610]  What?
[51:04.070 --> 51:04.950]  Oh, wow.
[51:05.030 --> 51:06.930]  I totally forgot about that.
[51:07.190 --> 51:07.910]  Oh, mouth shot!
[51:08.510 --> 51:09.490]  Or maybe more than a year.
[51:10.590 --> 51:11.650]  Like he didn't get it up.
[51:12.110 --> 51:13.830]  Didn't he arrested a ton of times?
[51:14.030 --> 51:16.210]  Wasn't he just like a basically a criminal?
[51:17.030 --> 51:20.570]  Well, I mean, he was a goddamn national treasure is what he was.
[51:20.770 --> 51:21.710]  I don't know about that.
[51:22.010 --> 51:23.510]  I don't know if the law applied to him.
[51:24.830 --> 51:26.350]  I also don't know much about his personal life.
[51:26.410 --> 51:27.570]  So if he was a monster, I have...
[51:28.190 --> 51:31.790]  July 24th, July 24th of this year.
[51:32.230 --> 51:36.650]  Family of James Brown settles 15 year battle over his estate.
[51:38.150 --> 51:39.850]  So it was a little more than six months.
[51:40.030 --> 51:40.170]  Okay.
[51:42.770 --> 51:45.850]  James Brown's body cut up for paternity test.
[51:45.850 --> 51:48.170]  Relocated several times.
[51:50.210 --> 51:51.410]  Holy shit.
[51:51.730 --> 51:52.210]  That's insane.
[51:54.670 --> 51:57.930]  I can see why he hated his American movie.
[52:01.490 --> 52:03.110]  This also doesn't work.
[52:03.210 --> 52:06.590]  Like if you went to see James Brown and even if the performance is great,
[52:06.650 --> 52:07.870]  this isn't James Brown.
[52:08.030 --> 52:08.830]  Like this is...
[52:08.830 --> 52:09.370]  I'd be pissed.
[52:12.520 --> 52:15.600]  The government programmed it to do this?
[52:17.800 --> 52:19.720]  This is weirdly the rifle tricks function.
[52:23.480 --> 52:27.820]  Also, Jackie Chan at this point is a huge global star.
[52:28.140 --> 52:31.540]  He read this script and agreed to do this.
[52:31.940 --> 52:33.100]  Like he knew this was coming.
[52:33.820 --> 52:36.000]  As I said, this is how much you wanted to work with Spielberg.
[52:36.280 --> 52:38.400]  He's like, I didn't like this movie from the beginning,
[52:38.680 --> 52:40.440]  but I felt this was an end with him.
[52:40.760 --> 52:41.720]  Because it was a DreamWorks movie.
[52:42.260 --> 52:43.000]  I'll say this too.
[52:44.000 --> 52:48.300]  Obviously a true fucking professional because he is putting on a show.
[52:48.620 --> 52:50.840]  I don't think he ever half-assed anything.
[52:51.200 --> 52:51.720]  I agree.
[52:51.960 --> 52:55.520]  You can never tell by watching him.
[52:56.420 --> 52:58.640]  Like this looks like his favorite movie right now.
[53:03.860 --> 53:09.060]  So the guy trying to end the world just goes to a James Brown show because he likes to?
[53:10.100 --> 53:11.140]  Why is he there?
[53:13.140 --> 53:15.160]  This scene is way too long.
[53:15.160 --> 53:16.960]  Why is this still going?
[53:18.180 --> 53:19.860]  Why are we still here?
[53:21.220 --> 53:22.640]  This scene's for Geoff.
[53:22.700 --> 53:26.960]  Directors wanted to use every single frame of this ass scene that they shot.
[53:27.700 --> 53:28.740]  That's a lot of...
[53:28.740 --> 53:32.420]  There's a lot of Jackie Chan ass in this movie.
[53:32.960 --> 53:34.230]  Remember when you think that...
[53:35.660 --> 53:36.880]  That's Jackie Chan, right?
[53:36.900 --> 53:37.920]  He wouldn't use a body double.
[53:38.500 --> 53:39.780]  Does all his own stunts.
[53:39.940 --> 53:41.400]  100% Jackie Chan.
[53:41.680 --> 53:41.800]  Yeah.
[53:41.800 --> 53:45.680]  I like the idea of him never using a stuntman for all of his fights,
[53:45.760 --> 53:46.940]  but he gets like a butt double.
[53:47.900 --> 53:50.240]  Well, you know also he's got to have a great ass, right?
[53:50.340 --> 53:53.840]  After an entire lifetime of the workouts that he does, the shape he's in,
[53:54.040 --> 53:55.400]  he's got to have buns of steel.
[53:56.080 --> 53:57.040]  He's got some moves.
[53:59.940 --> 54:02.340]  I'd love to know how much they paid James Brown for that role.
[54:03.080 --> 54:03.500]  I do not.
[54:03.720 --> 54:04.520]  Probably more than Jackie Chan.
[54:05.320 --> 54:08.060]  Was there a list of people that could have been?
[54:08.200 --> 54:09.940]  How did they settle on James Brown?
[54:10.100 --> 54:11.060]  Why James Brown?
[54:11.060 --> 54:13.480]  I want to know the full list of possible candidates.
[54:19.980 --> 54:20.700]  Excuse me?
[54:22.280 --> 54:22.640]  What?
[54:23.280 --> 54:23.900]  It's a code word.
[54:27.560 --> 54:29.220]  It's a play. It's like an NFL play.
[54:29.400 --> 54:31.620]  It was the equivalent of like yelling Omaha at the line, Geoff.
[54:32.220 --> 54:33.020]  Oh, okay. Got it.
[54:38.760 --> 54:39.820]  That lady's got a lot of teeth.
[54:41.980 --> 54:44.920]  Would you say an above average number of teeth?
[54:45.900 --> 54:47.140]  Just they're very prominent.
[54:48.720 --> 54:51.100]  I've never looked at someone who said they have a lot of teeth.
[54:52.420 --> 54:55.760]  No, I can introduce you to some people from my past.
[54:56.360 --> 54:58.200]  I've met some people with teeth before, man.
[54:59.700 --> 55:01.600]  Like just a lot of them or just very prominent?
[55:01.800 --> 55:03.620]  All kinds. A lot of them. Prominent.
[55:03.880 --> 55:06.100]  Like I knew a lady with sharp teeth.
[55:06.420 --> 55:08.260]  She had like 80 teeth and they were tiny.
[55:08.480 --> 55:09.440]  This freaking suit.
[55:09.680 --> 55:10.680]  It's not even subcategories.
[55:10.680 --> 55:11.120]  Did he say mashed potato?
[55:11.480 --> 55:14.000]  Yeah, he's got mashed potato right next to it.
[55:14.160 --> 55:17.620]  Yeah, but it's in like the same list as like smash the room up.
[55:17.760 --> 55:20.720]  It's like this thing, these folders or something or sub menus.
[55:20.720 --> 55:22.660]  It's an organizational mess.
[55:23.380 --> 55:24.500]  A 92 Dasani.
[55:31.330 --> 55:35.670]  She could correctly identify the brand and year of water.
[55:38.690 --> 55:40.150]  The worst X-Men ability.
[55:40.710 --> 55:42.910]  I bet I could pull out Dasani from other waters.
[55:42.930 --> 55:44.570]  Oh, I could definitely taste it.
[55:44.950 --> 55:45.750]  I couldn't tell you the year.
[55:45.950 --> 55:49.270]  You could taste the fucking gross oil film.
[55:49.730 --> 55:50.470]  Dasani sucks.
[55:51.470 --> 55:53.650]  No, I enjoy it.
[55:53.810 --> 55:56.290]  It's like water with a hint of motor oil.
[55:58.510 --> 56:00.430]  It's a very aggressive water tank.
[56:01.870 --> 56:05.970]  I feel very strongly about Dasani and I have for a long time.
[56:06.410 --> 56:08.430]  I think it was banned in England for some reason.
[56:14.250 --> 56:15.850]  Probably because of the fossil fuels.
[56:16.730 --> 56:20.310]  Has he done anything since this movie started to advance his plan?
[56:21.170 --> 56:22.250]  Like he killed the one guy.
[56:23.190 --> 56:24.050]  Like, what has he done?
[56:24.790 --> 56:26.230]  He's just hanging out at this concert.
[56:32.170 --> 56:35.130]  Well, that's what that's what leaders do, right?
[56:35.130 --> 56:38.070]  They hire the right people and delegate.
[56:39.530 --> 56:41.650]  So they can focus on the bigger picture.
[56:49.690 --> 56:50.890]  Oh, dang it.
[57:04.090 --> 57:06.310]  Does that mean he had input on that plan?
[57:07.730 --> 57:08.850]  He signed up.
[57:08.910 --> 57:10.430]  He probably had to approve the purchase order.
[57:10.810 --> 57:12.950]  What other bubs do they have?
[57:13.010 --> 57:14.450]  Do they have a jet ski bomb?
[57:14.450 --> 57:19.210]  Like the implication, the phrasing of it is they have multiple types of bombs for vehicles.
[57:20.490 --> 57:22.990]  I want to talk to this woman about the casting of this movie.
[57:24.050 --> 57:27.410]  She gets called a vacuous and rancid tart.
[57:29.350 --> 57:30.450]  It's pretty extreme.
[57:41.580 --> 57:43.340]  I'm not sure what she's getting at there.
[57:45.260 --> 57:46.880]  He's still just thinking about Walter Strider.
[57:47.700 --> 57:48.860]  Trying to get to the bottom of this.
[57:52.000 --> 57:53.260]  Wait, they just left?
[57:53.260 --> 57:54.340]  They found...
[57:54.340 --> 57:54.680]  What?
[57:56.300 --> 58:00.040]  Yeah, they found out she's CSA and he owns a BMW and they were like, we got to go.
[58:01.700 --> 58:02.400]  There's... okay.
[58:03.340 --> 58:07.400]  I feel like that's classic, like the henchmen capture them at this point.
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.160]  Like something... they don't just leave the restaurant.
[58:11.060 --> 58:12.260]  How are you going to capture the suit?
[58:13.360 --> 58:13.900]  It's a great point.
[58:14.680 --> 58:15.240]  That's true.
[58:15.500 --> 58:17.340]  I really hope we see mashed potato mode.
[58:29.340 --> 58:30.640]  Oh, is he going up the outside?
[58:32.220 --> 58:32.580]  Why?
[58:33.880 --> 58:34.600]  I don't know.
[58:35.340 --> 58:39.360]  Why is she walking alone by the pool at night?
[58:40.300 --> 58:41.140]  And in slow-mo.
[58:43.840 --> 58:45.040]  Is that how you would have filmed it?
[58:45.980 --> 58:47.800]  I would have had her in focus a bit more, probably.
[58:51.440 --> 58:54.200]  I mean, I know they were going for a pool focus, but it was too soon.
[58:54.920 --> 58:55.980]  So fucking critical.
[59:02.120 --> 59:03.300]  Jesus, what was that?
[59:11.490 --> 59:13.330]  He's got a super fast search.
[59:13.510 --> 59:15.070]  Oh, that was amazing.
[59:15.690 --> 59:17.870]  How the fuck is she going to control the bubble size?
[59:17.910 --> 59:20.870]  Yeah, I was going to say, I've never... I don't think bubble preference is a thing.
[59:22.470 --> 59:23.330]  That was a James Bond move there.
[59:23.350 --> 59:27.310]  I think it was supposed to be innuendo, but I don't know in what way.
[59:40.810 --> 59:42.890]  I said it jokingly at the beginning of the movie.
[59:43.050 --> 59:46.910]  I truly do believe the most medicine character has been the guy Jackie Chan
[59:46.910 --> 59:49.270]  accidentally hit with the bike guy in the beginning.
[59:49.630 --> 59:52.270]  We have never peaked that level of intimidation.
[59:52.770 --> 59:54.690]  I wonder what else that guy's been in and done.
[01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:03.890]  I don't even know. Let's see if I can find him.
[01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:07.770]  That's a weird foot. Like the fourth toe was long.
[01:00:08.170 --> 01:00:10.510]  Usually it's like the second one or the big one.
[01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:13.950]  I don't know what you want, Gavin. You're saying they're being too aggressive with her looks,
[01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:16.170]  and then you come for her feet as soon as they're revealed.
[01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:17.650]  You immediately have negative feed text.
[01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:19.950]  I could have just done without that close-up, I'll be honest.
[01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:21.710]  I agree with the close-up.
[01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:22.550]  I'm not a foot guy.
[01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:24.710]  No, I'm not either.
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:35.380]  I'm powerless without this tuxedo.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:36.960]  What if you only lose half?
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.360]  Can you fuck better in the tuxedo?
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.420]  Depends on what mode is it.
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.380]  Yeah, what mode?
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.740]  Maybe that's what mashed potato is.
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.280]  Oh, no.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.260]  It would just be pussy demolition.
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:55.740]  Gross.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.900]  I think you're going to regret saying that later.
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:01.180]  Absolutely.
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:13.140]  It's like suddenly this movie turned into true romance.
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:14.020]  Oh, my lord.
[01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:21.950]  Nothing is taking a beating in this movie like inanimate objects.
[01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:24.570]  Once again, getting slammed.
[01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:26.950]  Oh, no, they'll fall into the pool.
[01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:29.810]  He has got a whole handful of tit there.
[01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:31.230]  Good lord.
[01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:33.950]  Oh, wipe.
[01:01:34.330 --> 01:01:35.290]  How unnecessary.
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:41.660]  Oh, that's cute.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:46.040]  Jesus.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.740]  The things I'm gonna do to meet Spielberg.
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:53.220]  Did he ever like work with...
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.400]  Was he ever in like a Spielberg movie?
[01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:56.580]  I don't think so.
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:58.100]  He just really wanted to meet him.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:05.180]  Something funny about trying to kick a door open and your foot goes straight through it.
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:08.180]  It's more anus shots.
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.800]  Yeah, that was his work, right?
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:15.440]  He's like, I'll be in the movie, but I really want to show off my tush.
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:17.200]  That bit was cool.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.980]  Did you see pants only defense mode?
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:20.860]  Yeah.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:27.860]  What movie has that guy ever been menacing?
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:29.920]  Dawn of the Dead.
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:30.760]  He was in that movie.
[01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:31.300]  I recognize.
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:32.460]  Yeah, he was like Tucker.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.040]  No, he wasn't menacing.
[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:37.820]  The classic fighting while getting dressed.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.120]  Chuck E. Chud's amazing.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.020]  Doesn't it button itself up?
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:49.480]  It does.
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:51.500]  Nice.
[01:03:02.290 --> 01:03:04.010]  It's a great sound effects of this movie.
[01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:04.860]  I'll give it that.
[01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:09.710]  What was that?
[01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:14.350]  So you're definitely back in at this point, right?
[01:03:14.890 --> 01:03:15.390]  Absolutely.
[01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:20.110]  I don't see how you couldn't be.
[01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:25.190]  Maybe you just, at your age, couldn't appreciate it.
[01:03:25.610 --> 01:03:27.810]  On the level that we can as adults now.
[01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:34.990]  I mean, I feel like you can... About Jackie Chan movie, you just enjoy a selection of scenes.
[01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:37.590]  Like, I liked that fight that we just watched.
[01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:38.670]  That was a good fight!
[01:03:39.130 --> 01:03:42.830]  You just accidentally killed that guy.
[01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:44.770]  Oh wait, is he gonna save him?
[01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:46.310]  No, he's landing in the water.
[01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:48.330]  Oh yeah, I forgot, water's fine.
[01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:50.210]  He landed on the other dude!
[01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:55.590]  Fucking Christ!
[01:03:56.570 --> 01:03:57.790]  What a shitty way to die.
[01:04:12.610 --> 01:04:13.270]  The Emperor.
[01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:15.170]  Emperor, come back.
[01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:17.550]  She thinks he's the Emperor.
[01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:23.870]  Oof. Oof.
[01:04:25.330 --> 01:04:25.930]  Oof.
[01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:29.750]  What if that was just an unnecessary bone sticking out?
[01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:31.010]  What?
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:50.200]  I don't know who any of these people are.
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:52.460]  That's Jennifer Love Hewitt, that's Jackie Chan.
[01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:06.340]  Diarrhea.
[01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:11.640]  I don't like this!
[01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:19.110]  What?
[01:05:35.610 --> 01:05:35.970]  What?
[01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:41.050]  I assume at this point, when I was a kid, I was just hanging in there for the outtakes.
[01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:44.530]  Yeah, no, absolutely. At this point, you know they're gonna deliver.
[01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:46.650]  Do you guys have trouble sleeping too?
[01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.870]  I mean...
[01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:51.510]  I do.
[01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:54.010]  I couldn't sleep last night.
[01:05:55.350 --> 01:05:58.510]  I guess I'm a lot more like Jackie Chan than I realized.
[01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:14.210]  How do you think they felt?
[01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:16.790]  I know movies don't shoot this way.
[01:06:17.050 --> 01:06:19.370]  Let's just assume they're shooting this in chronological order.
[01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:21.850]  How do you think they feel about the movie at this point?
[01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:24.370]  Yeah, like at what point were they like...
[01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:25.590]  Oh boy.
[01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:31.350]  Did they ever know? I wonder if they still like...
[01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:33.510]  Actually, let me go on the director's webpage.
[01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:35.850]  Called it a Kung Fu classic, I believe.
[01:06:36.010 --> 01:06:37.650]  So I don't think...
[01:06:37.650 --> 01:06:38.210]  A classic?
[01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:39.410]  I believe so.
[01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:43.750]  I wonder how many people find out their movie is bad on opening night.
[01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:47.450]  You surely must know in the edit.
[01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:49.670]  I don't know.
[01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:51.390]  You would assume.
[01:06:57.350 --> 01:06:57.650]  Let's see.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:01.500]  Wait.
[01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:03.600]  Is she bad?
[01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:04.980]  Or is she good?
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:08.800]  I don't know who she is.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:09.840]  She's a good guy, right?
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:10.740]  Or is she a bad guy?
[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:11.400]  She's a good guy.
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.100]  Is she in Zoolander?
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:14.280]  Yeah!
[01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:16.720]  That's the thing. She's in.
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:17.320]  Yeah.
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:22.900]  She's Will Ferrell, I think.
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.860]  Did he just photocopy that?
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:25.500]  That was awesome.
[01:07:33.370 --> 01:07:36.390]  It's really disappointing they never let him just do a dramatic movie.
[01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:40.110]  He did at some point, right?
[01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:41.770]  That's what the foreigner was.
[01:07:42.370 --> 01:07:43.750]  But it's still an action movie.
[01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:45.490]  I don't want any action.
[01:07:45.790 --> 01:07:46.530]  You don't want it to fight?
[01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:50.550]  I want you to take away everything that makes Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan.
[01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:52.610]  And let him do that.
[01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:56.430]  He just needs his Philadelphia.
[01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:58.190]  He does.
[01:07:58.890 --> 01:07:59.230]  Yeah.
[01:08:01.350 --> 01:08:03.470]  He can flip pancakes in a cool way.
[01:08:03.570 --> 01:08:05.550]  There's a way to add some stunts.
[01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:07.610]  To a family drama.
[01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:10.250]  They couldn't have put those in a pallet case?
[01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:12.330]  You know, he didn't do...
[01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:15.190]  He didn't do a lot of...
[01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:18.710]  A lot of karate in the Karate Kid remake.
[01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:19.830]  He was more of the mentor.
[01:08:20.670 --> 01:08:21.430]  That's true.
[01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:23.150]  Leaving it up to the kids.
[01:08:27.850 --> 01:08:29.790]  How much do you think they paid for this song?
[01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:34.270]  Can we use this?
[01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:35.390]  Could this be our theme song?
[01:08:35.650 --> 01:08:37.530]  I feel like this is public.
[01:08:37.810 --> 01:08:38.470]  I don't want it.
[01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:40.570]  I'm just...
[01:08:40.570 --> 01:08:41.990]  It's available, I assume.
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:47.940]  If we could have a theme song that we paid for,
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:50.280]  I would want it to be Jackie Chan singing...
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:51.760]  He has 13 albums.
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:53.880]  We could get some Jackie Chan music.
[01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:55.880]  Well, I would want him specifically
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:56.740]  singing James Brown.
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.120]  I think we could do that.
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:01.140]  Geoff, let me tell you about a movie.
[01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:04.560]  Also, he didn't sing that.
[01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:06.160]  Didn't they just pull James Brown's audio?
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:07.920]  I feel like he just lip-synced.
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:08.900]  They didn't even let him sing.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:10.380]  How sad.
[01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:17.190]  Man, that looks expensive as shit.
[01:09:17.770 --> 01:09:18.210]  Yeah.
[01:09:18.210 --> 01:09:20.170]  This is where the budget went.
[01:09:20.670 --> 01:09:20.950]  Yeah.
[01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:26.410]  Imagine the director
[01:09:26.410 --> 01:09:27.770]  describing what he wants
[01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:29.630]  to the props department.
[01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:31.450]  They're like, for this movie?
[01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:31.970]  Alright.
[01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:36.170]  I like the secret entrance
[01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:38.150]  to my bunker to be
[01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:40.070]  a thing that people would just naturally do.
[01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:41.970]  All the time. There and there.
[01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:43.870]  It's like,
[01:09:44.010 --> 01:09:45.570]  let's downsize from the pool.
[01:09:45.570 --> 01:09:47.270]  Let's make the secret entrance a hot tub
[01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:49.450]  and spend the money we save on a new script.
[01:09:52.170 --> 01:09:53.370]  Is that deer piss?
[01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:55.390]  To the left? A lot of deer piss.
[01:09:58.050 --> 01:09:59.410]  Does Stormey get to fight
[01:09:59.410 --> 01:10:00.010]  Chan in this?
[01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:02.590]  I don't think so.
[01:10:03.710 --> 01:10:05.470]  He doesn't strike me as a fighting
[01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:05.930]  character.
[01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:28.210]  How many ladders has Jackie Chan slid
[01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:29.010]  down in his life?
[01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:30.950]  I bet he's got a record.
[01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:33.070]  I bet he's got the record for most
[01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:34.210]  ladder slides in film.
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:41.320]  This set looks like half of every scene
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:42.660]  in the first three X-Men movies.
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.500]  Which was the Uma Thurman
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:50.160]  Batman movie?
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:52.220]  Oh.
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:54.660]  Was that Robin?
[01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:55.380]  No.
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:57.660]  Yeah, it was.
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:00.780]  It's got those vibes for me.
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:08.420]  Thank you.
[01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:20.030]  What?
[01:11:20.170 --> 01:11:20.430]  Okay.
[01:11:20.890 --> 01:11:22.730]  How far into this movie are we?
[01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:25.770]  It's gotta be the end.
[01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:27.470]  We're an hour and nine in.
[01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:29.910]  It took one hour and nine minutes
[01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:32.070]  for the main characters
[01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:33.530]  to learn what we learned
[01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:34.610]  three minutes in.
[01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:36.590]  What are they doing?
[01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:39.790]  Oh, it can camo?
[01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:41.630]  Wait, how is it camoing
[01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:42.590]  when she was behind?
[01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:45.370]  Wouldn't it have to camo
[01:11:45.370 --> 01:11:46.770]  what was the back of the suit?
[01:11:47.130 --> 01:11:48.730]  No, it says it works the same
[01:11:48.730 --> 01:11:50.070]  as the Harry Potter cloak.
[01:11:51.570 --> 01:11:52.950]  She was in the suit with him?
[01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:54.230]  Yeah, probably.
[01:11:54.850 --> 01:11:55.690]  It wrapped around her.
[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:06.120]  That scene would have been way funnier
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.320]  if she was just stood there on her own
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.640]  and he was materialistic.
[01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:22.510]  That really would have been
[01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:23.110]  pretty funny.
[01:12:24.250 --> 01:12:25.590]  You really liked that?
[01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:28.970]  That funny scene would have made the movie twice as good.
[01:12:29.230 --> 01:12:29.930]  Just that.
[01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:32.750]  That got me thinking
[01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:33.970]  like, man,
[01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:36.750]  they should call us to punch up
[01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:38.190]  one scene in every movie.
[01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:43.390]  I like that idea a lot.
[01:12:44.050 --> 01:12:46.810]  Between the five of us, somebody will have a funny idea.
[01:12:47.190 --> 01:12:47.530]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:49.370]  I'd be terrible at that for a living.
[01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:50.650]  If that was my actual job,
[01:12:50.690 --> 01:12:52.410]  and I was just watching movies all the time,
[01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:54.890]  if it was the occasional one movie,
[01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:56.690]  and I just had to punch up one moment,
[01:12:56.770 --> 01:12:57.970]  I think I could nail that job.
[01:12:58.370 --> 01:12:59.610]  I totally agree.
[01:13:01.730 --> 01:13:03.990]  There needs to be a scene of the year award.
[01:13:04.290 --> 01:13:05.090]  We need to be like,
[01:13:05.150 --> 01:13:07.230]  we have won eight consecutive years
[01:13:07.230 --> 01:13:08.570]  our punch ups.
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:20.320]  Oh, shit.
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:27.140]  Does she...
[01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:28.980]  Okay, it doesn't matter.
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:30.020]  Never mind. I don't care.
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:31.520]  I had no idea she didn't know that.
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.580]  Who cares at this point?
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:36.520]  Like, after everything he's done,
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:37.380]  who cares?
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:40.020]  They saved your life like 86 times.
[01:13:49.570 --> 01:13:51.330]  Do the shoes do stuff?
[01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:00.810]  His roommates?
[01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:02.330]  He's wearing his roommate's underwear?
[01:14:03.210 --> 01:14:04.070]  I think so.
[01:14:05.210 --> 01:14:06.950]  You know what? That tracks for a dude
[01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:08.290]  that wears a Hooters shirt all the time.
[01:14:10.690 --> 01:14:12.210]  They both have the same roommate?
[01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.430]  I...
[01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:18.330]  We could have made that scene better.
[01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:20.290]  Maybe we could have punched up two scenes.
[01:14:20.490 --> 01:14:22.350]  Yeah, we could have improved that.
[01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:38.530]  That is the moment of the film.
[01:14:38.710 --> 01:14:38.950]  Yeah.
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:55.760]  Wait, did she...
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:57.680]  Oh.
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:00.740]  Everything's got flash.
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:02.120]  Everything's got a flash.
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:11.630]  Oh, those are pretty chairs.
[01:15:12.670 --> 01:15:13.250]  And a sofa.
[01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:15.010]  That's like rich people shit.
[01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:16.230]  If The Sims taught me anything,
[01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:18.130]  when you can spend more money on a couch,
[01:15:18.210 --> 01:15:20.970]  it's gonna be all uncomfortable and divvied like that.
[01:15:21.690 --> 01:15:23.530]  Dude, I bet that thing's super comfy.
[01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:24.290]  Really?
[01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:26.570]  Maybe I got the wrong impression.
[01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:29.370]  I think that they're not comfortable at first,
[01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:31.150]  but once they're like 40 years old,
[01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:32.590]  it's like the most comfortable thing ever.
[01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:47.130]  Is that some sort of discovery happening here?
[01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.810]  Oh my god.
[01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:49.550]  Hey, he's figuring out Walter Strider
[01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:52.110]  is Water Strider.
[01:15:52.930 --> 01:15:53.410]  Oh.
[01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:56.310]  Are you just figuring that out too?
[01:15:57.570 --> 01:15:58.430]  Water Strider.
[01:15:58.710 --> 01:15:59.770]  Cuts to him at a Hooters.
[01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:10.210]  Didn't they make that
[01:16:10.210 --> 01:16:11.570]  painfully obvious in the beginning?
[01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:14.070]  What do you mean?
[01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:16.070]  I think to the audience, but maybe not to the driver.
[01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:18.030]  Yeah, I think it's a problem of
[01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:20.130]  us as an audience knowing way more
[01:16:20.130 --> 01:16:20.710]  than the characters.
[01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:21.910]  We're a little more omniscient.
[01:16:23.330 --> 01:16:27.420]  Dude, who knew that guy
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:28.360]  could dance like that?
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:29.620]  And he didn't even have the suit on.
[01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:33.000]  Do you think this is the most phoned-in
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.420]  bad guy performance of all time?
[01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:41.240]  He is more sadistic than...
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:43.260]  He ripped the guy's hand in half.
[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:44.920]  But he just hasn't done anything.
[01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:46.060]  Is the problem.
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:52.160]  Ah, shit.
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:54.360]  It's up for it.
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:01.000]  I always wonder where you hire people to work in this lab.
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.800]  Like, is this a LinkedIn thing?
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:04.400]  Like, how do you get staff for this?
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:06.660]  Well, this is before LinkedIn, so this is probably
[01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:07.500]  the Walmart's.
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:10.660]  Or Craigslist. Maybe just way outside
[01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:11.380]  of a prison.
[01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:14.020]  Damn it!
[01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:29.720]  It's adding a different element to the movie
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:31.480]  than what we get to experience.
[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:34.240]  This is the punch-up that this film needed.
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:35.740]  And there's nothing
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:36.680]  I can do to stop it.
[01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:41.680]  I want you to go into movie theaters with Henry.
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:43.160]  And just ask
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:46.140]  people around you
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:46.620]  to react.
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:49.160]  Yeah.
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:50.520]  You get it, buddy.
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:09.620]  Do you think this...
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:11.940]  Can you guys think of another movie
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:13.540]  it's kind of what Andrew was saying earlier
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.960]  where you could tell the people that are in it
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:17.200]  wanted to be in it less?
[01:18:21.650 --> 01:18:23.670]  Where they're, like, actively fighting the film.
[01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.830]  I'm trying to think of examples.
[01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:27.130]  I would say the entirety of Diamonds Are Forever.
[01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:28.370]  Just look at Sean Connery.
[01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:30.110]  Yeah, there you go. That's a good one.
[01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:33.090]  For me, it's probably The Cell. I don't know if you guys ever saw that movie.
[01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:35.150]  It's a Jennifer Lopez movie. I think Vince Vaughn was in it.
[01:18:35.150 --> 01:18:37.170]  Go watch that movie now
[01:18:37.170 --> 01:18:39.710]  and you will see people getting more depressed
[01:18:39.710 --> 01:18:41.290]  as the film progresses.
[01:18:43.730 --> 01:18:44.710]  I will say
[01:18:44.710 --> 01:18:47.950]  Alvin and the Tripmunks 3 is a good one for that.
[01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:49.150]  Because David Cross
[01:18:49.150 --> 01:18:51.350]  signed on to make three movies from the beginning
[01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:52.610]  and he's fucking miserable.
[01:18:53.010 --> 01:18:55.330]  And the third one they filmed all in Hawaii
[01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:56.850]  and he had to wear a mascot's outfit.
[01:18:57.370 --> 01:18:59.210]  And his characters upset the entire movie
[01:18:59.210 --> 01:19:01.370]  and it's one of the greatest performances I've ever seen
[01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:02.190]  because he's not performing.
[01:19:02.190 --> 01:19:04.230]  He's just genuinely miserable.
[01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:06.590]  Is Jason Lee still in those
[01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:07.490]  or is he off of them now?
[01:19:07.770 --> 01:19:09.590]  I think he was in the fourth one
[01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:10.670]  and they stopped there.
[01:19:11.550 --> 01:19:24.710]  Oh, he's got a tuxedo now.
[01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.970]  The tuxedo.
[01:19:31.290 --> 01:19:31.750]  Detain.
[01:19:33.170 --> 01:19:34.030]  Demonstration mode?
[01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:37.890]  It starts the exact same way as demolition mode.
[01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:38.650]  It does.
[01:19:38.650 --> 01:19:41.470]  This is how Steve Jobs
[01:19:41.470 --> 01:19:42.250]  opened the keynote
[01:19:42.250 --> 01:19:43.330]  with this product.
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:15.480]  Why does this guy hate water?
[01:20:18.850 --> 01:20:19.390]  Oh shit.
[01:20:20.730 --> 01:20:21.250]  Damn.
[01:20:21.370 --> 01:20:21.870]  That was a fall.
[01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:25.190]  There's no way he keeps his teeth.
[01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:35.900]  It's actually the reaction they had when reading the script.
[01:20:41.890 --> 01:20:44.590]  I'm getting the call you actually were casted for the movie.
[01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:46.630]  Isn't that the dragon fire
[01:20:46.630 --> 01:20:47.830]  that's under King's Landing?
[01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:49.150]  It is, yeah.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:56.280]  The high sparrow's right above this.
[01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:06.220]  That was a good stunt.
[01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:10.200]  They just tie a rope around him and yank it.
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:12.220]  I'd assume.
[01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:24.140]  Laughter.
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:33.040]  Laughter.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:36.540]  Cheer.
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:44.240]  A good suit.
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:48.880]  Is this the only movie
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.720]  where two pieces of clothing are fighting?
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:51.920]  Laughter.
[01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:55.060]  Like we're just witnessing two outfits fighting each other.
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:56.460]  They could both be asleep.
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:58.500]  Oh, he fell! Check his shirt!
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:00.060]  Laughter.
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:07.080]  Isn't this essentially like the male version
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.640]  of the House of Gucci, I guess?
[01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:11.340]  What do you mean?
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:14.760]  There was a movie about ladies fashion.
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:17.280]  Sorry, I just wasted it on us.
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.620]  It was relevant
[01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:21.620]  because it's out right now.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:24.640]  Adam Driver's in it, right?
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:25.880]  Lady Gaga, yeah.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.260]  That was a great joke.
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:30.420]  Thanks.
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:38.000]  Throw a thud up!
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:43.740]  Do you think they'd have software updates
[01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:44.640]  for the tuxedo?
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:47.760]  Like what if in the middle of a fight sequence
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:48.860]  you needed a firmware update?
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:58.040]  Suddenly your tuxedo gets slower for no reason.
[01:23:01.690 --> 01:23:02.870]  What is going on?
[01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:04.030]  What is all this shit?
[01:23:08.050 --> 01:23:10.490]  Why was there a pool full of snakes?
[01:23:10.990 --> 01:23:13.530]  I don't know, Eric.
[01:23:14.290 --> 01:23:15.790]  That was for the poison snakes
[01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:17.490]  that are gonna infiltrate
[01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:19.690]  with the mosquitoes or whatever.
[01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:21.150]  We're under King's Landing again.
[01:23:21.670 --> 01:23:22.710]  Yeah, under King's Landing again.
[01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:24.530]  The sound effects!
[01:23:25.370 --> 01:23:27.050]  I think it was the same sound effects
[01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:28.410]  I put on Geoff's bike trick.
[01:23:32.570 --> 01:23:33.690]  He's gonna...
[01:23:42.730 --> 01:23:43.970]  So are they in a
[01:23:43.970 --> 01:23:45.450]  water reservoir right now?
[01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:47.730]  If he opens that, what does that mean?
[01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:49.730]  I think it
[01:23:49.730 --> 01:23:51.870]  contaminates the water and then people die.
[01:23:52.330 --> 01:23:53.070]  I think it lets
[01:23:53.690 --> 01:23:54.910]  all the bugs out.
[01:23:55.710 --> 01:23:56.710]  I don't know.
[01:23:57.190 --> 01:23:59.530]  It's like the opposite of what Bill Gates is doing
[01:23:59.530 --> 01:24:00.210]  with mosquitoes.
[01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:07.400]  The shoelaces just
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:07.980]  attacked him.
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:09.800]  The shoes are involved.
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.660]  The shoes are in.
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:12.760]  Wow!
[01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:19.360]  Oh, fuck.
[01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:26.380]  It'd be really great
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:28.260]  if this is where I realize what Walter Strider
[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:28.520]  meant.
[01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:31.280]  Ten minutes left.
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:34.260]  What was off to the credits?
[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:36.620]  It's in
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:37.360]  the blooper reel.
[01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:43.560]  Why is the computer moving?
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:47.720]  Is it
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:48.480]  still moving? Where is
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:49.820]  Pantuit?
[01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:52.880]  Nevermind.
[01:25:06.730 --> 01:25:08.100]  Just kick him in the testes.
[01:25:08.590 --> 01:25:09.290]  Could you
[01:25:10.090 --> 01:25:11.890]  change his suit profile?
[01:25:12.770 --> 01:25:12.950]  Yeah.
[01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:15.490]  Oh, like hack his suit?
[01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:17.950]  Yeah, like could you just go to mashed potato mode?
[01:25:20.050 --> 01:25:21.410]  That felt very Looney Tunes.
[01:25:21.410 --> 01:25:24.370]  Oh, shit.
[01:25:25.190 --> 01:25:26.370]  Oh, he's melting a bit.
[01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:28.350]  Just a bit.
[01:25:28.570 --> 01:25:29.450]  Just a little sear.
[01:25:32.890 --> 01:25:34.310]  You're a cab driver!
[01:25:35.150 --> 01:25:36.790]  Why are you okay with this?
[01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:52.010]  It sounded like a guess.
[01:25:52.930 --> 01:25:54.430]  Wasn't confident in his delivery.
[01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:55.970]  Fucking stupid.
[01:25:55.970 --> 01:25:58.150]  So, was she calling him a queen earlier?
[01:25:58.230 --> 01:25:59.150]  Is that what the joke was?
[01:26:00.150 --> 01:26:01.390]  I don't know.
[01:26:10.770 --> 01:26:20.220]  Oh, no!
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:22.260]  Oh, they failed so quickly!
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.320]  Everyone is just like, wait a second.
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:30.300]  What's gonna happen?
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:32.660]  Don't mosquitoes
[01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:33.700]  live for like a day?
[01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:36.400]  It's something short like that.
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:37.620]  Yeah, it's like two days, I think.
[01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:39.540]  Is this a mosquito or a water strider?
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:41.440]  It's a water strider!
[01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:42.880]  They said the name a bunch of times.
[01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:43.980]  Oh, yeah, yeah, I forgot.
[01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:48.800]  Yeah, Walter Strider,
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:50.140]  not Moe Scalitto.
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:02.820]  Could you imagine having a plot
[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:05.220]  to end the world that could be stopped by a shot glass?
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.400]  Or a fucking...
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:11.940]  Or a fly swatter.
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:17.100]  I would eat the bug.
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:19.980]  I would have bit it.
[01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:21.420]  Save the world.
[01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:31.120]  None of these people are attacking you.
[01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:35.020]  They're not paid to, to be fair.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.700]  They just clean the snake pool.
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:38.800]  Like, they're...
[01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:40.180]  That's fair.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:42.360]  Oh, he's back!
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:43.400]  Oh, shit.
[01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:51.980]  This sucks!
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:54.320]  They got that shot in the edit and thought,
[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:57.300]  it shouldn't last 90 seconds, we're gonna have to speed this up.
[01:27:57.300 --> 01:27:59.280]  I have a feeling I know what's gonna happen.
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:12.600]  Oh, yeah.
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:13.240]  Oh, four times!
[01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:14.600]  Hell yeah!
[01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:25.980]  Good lord!
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:29.880]  Why is this so brutal?
[01:28:31.630 --> 01:28:33.980]  There were a lot of nightmares after this.
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:35.400]  There's Walter White.
[01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:41.140]  Oh my god!
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:42.400]  The mummy!
[01:28:51.850 --> 01:28:53.550]  Oh, this is like, the good guys show up now.
[01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:55.230]  This is what she was talking about.
[01:28:55.390 --> 01:28:56.610]  Now they got pallet cases.
[01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:02.960]  He's got the same shitty
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:04.680]  fucking sideburns.
[01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:19.060]  Bob!
[01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:23.920]  Maybe we should only watch movies
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:24.920]  that he's in.
[01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:26.540]  Bob movies?
[01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:27.120]  Yeah!
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:31.040]  He could never be an undercover agent.
[01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:34.460]  That guy's role was to run in and punch
[01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:35.960]  Jackie Chan in the face. That was it.
[01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:38.480]  Yeah. You wouldn't take that role?
[01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:39.940]  This is like a great one.
[01:29:48.650 --> 01:29:49.830]  I hate all your movies.
[01:29:50.490 --> 01:29:52.210]  It's an honor to help. I hate your films.
[01:30:03.930 --> 01:30:06.230]  Oh, not another guy in the snake pit!
[01:30:15.330 --> 01:30:15.970]  Oh, no.
[01:30:15.970 --> 01:30:17.810]  Oh, no.
[01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:21.700]  Do you guys
[01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:22.760]  remember what this is?
[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:25.820]  Are we gonna get the biker?
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:29.760]  If they
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:31.720]  pay off the biker gag.
[01:30:38.450 --> 01:30:38.770]  No!
[01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:40.310]  They are!
[01:30:44.810 --> 01:30:45.410]  Why?
[01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:50.070]  That guy
[01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:51.550]  didn't even do anything in the first place.
[01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:52.030]  No!
[01:30:53.250 --> 01:30:54.890]  He overreacted, definitely.
[01:30:55.190 --> 01:30:57.610]  It was a very New York reaction, though.
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:08.180]  By the way, this cost the United States government
[01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:09.660]  about $250 million.
[01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:12.240]  Just this 18 second operation
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:14.100]  where he gets revenge on a bike messenger.
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:29.180]  Oh, Jesus.
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:30.640]  I'm glad Devlin made it.
[01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:32.100]  I forgot that this was a thing.
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:33.520]  Nice beret.
[01:31:40.690 --> 01:31:41.690]  He's back!
[01:31:42.670 --> 01:31:43.750]  Oh, no!
[01:31:44.410 --> 01:31:45.410]  Why'd they do that?
[01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:01.890]  Is that Jorge from Lost?
[01:32:02.210 --> 01:32:02.990]  Yeah, it was Hurley.
[01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:04.750]  What?
[01:32:05.710 --> 01:32:06.750]  It's the homeless guy?
[01:32:07.770 --> 01:32:09.230]  I'm not even kidding, I think that was him.
[01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:10.450]  It looked like him, yeah.
[01:32:11.610 --> 01:32:11.950]  No.
[01:32:14.670 --> 01:32:15.390]  You know,
[01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:16.730]  it could have been Hurley.
[01:32:18.210 --> 01:32:19.370]  I don't think it was him.
[01:32:19.850 --> 01:32:21.770]  Let's see if it's Jorge Garcia's in the tuxedo.
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:48.900]  Wasn't him.
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:52.680]  It wasn't him?
[01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:53.900]  Wasn't him.
[01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:58.180]  He was busy making big shot confessions of a campus bookie
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:00.060]  in 2002, so he was not available.
[01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:01.340]  I'm not surprised.
[01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:02.780]  It did look like him.
[01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:03.840]  It did look like him.
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:13.280]  This movie's still going.
[01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:14.660]  He's an agent now?
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:18.440]  Yeah, that's how he can command
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:20.040]  so much
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:22.260]  of the government's might
[01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:22.820]  and money
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:25.940]  to ask a girl out on a date.
[01:33:34.530 --> 01:33:35.010]  What?
[01:33:35.010 --> 01:33:36.010]  That's a cute outfit she's wearing.
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:42.640]  Bet it doesn't have a mashed potato mode.
[01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:53.510]  Ask her out, dickhead!
[01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:55.750]  Jesus.
[01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:05.030]  Yes.
[01:34:07.410 --> 01:34:07.970]  There you go.
[01:34:18.190 --> 01:34:18.710]  I'm just here
[01:34:18.710 --> 01:34:20.130]  thinking about the skateboard bomb.
[01:34:23.490 --> 01:34:24.770]  There should have been more of that.
[01:34:25.490 --> 01:34:27.090]  Do you think they invent
[01:34:27.090 --> 01:34:29.250]  and then build a skateboard bomb?
[01:34:29.410 --> 01:34:30.570]  Or do you think they buy that from
[01:34:30.570 --> 01:34:31.550]  an evil
[01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:33.490]  mail order catalog?
[01:34:34.010 --> 01:34:35.570]  Do you think there's an evil eBay?
[01:34:36.530 --> 01:34:37.410]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:40.850]  It's like an overstock.com
[01:34:40.850 --> 01:34:41.830]  for life insurance.
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:52.260]  What the fu-
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:56.960]  He's gonna dick her!
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:58.060]  It sucks!
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:00.500]  Did it used to
[01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:01.340]  be called tux?
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:04.060]  It was. It was originally just called tux.
[01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:21.460]  Wow, she can move.
[01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:52.450]  I like the idea that
[01:35:52.450 --> 01:35:54.590]  this is like a 60 million
[01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:56.290]  dollar vehicle for a blooper reel.
[01:35:59.670 --> 01:36:02.290]  Jackie Chan might be the most likable person on earth.
[01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:04.530]  I know. He always says that the dialogue
[01:36:04.530 --> 01:36:06.290]  days are his least favorite. He just wants to
[01:36:06.290 --> 01:36:07.210]  punch stuff.
[01:36:09.310 --> 01:36:10.570]  He's never been confident
[01:36:10.570 --> 01:36:11.210]  in his English.
[01:36:11.590 --> 01:36:13.170]  But he's so naturally funny.
[01:36:13.170 --> 01:36:13.670]  I know.
[01:36:21.170 --> 01:36:22.730]  Did he just play
[01:36:22.730 --> 01:36:23.510]  the fuck stick?
[01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:32.920]  We should get Jackie Chan
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:35.420]  to voice a fuck stick
[01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:36.620]  that we could make.
[01:37:04.630 --> 01:37:06.030]  Well, that was a movie.
[01:37:06.050 --> 01:37:07.690]  Well, there you go.
[01:37:07.850 --> 01:37:09.550]  Eric just shot off the movie.
[01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:14.010]  Absolutely. Eric's
[01:37:14.010 --> 01:37:16.030]  fucking done. That movie
[01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:17.530]  is so...
[01:37:17.530 --> 01:37:20.070]  It's so long. It's so long
[01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:21.150]  for an hour and a half.
[01:37:21.310 --> 01:37:22.870]  Nothing happens for an hour.
[01:37:23.970 --> 01:37:25.410]  Yeah, that movie is like...
[01:37:25.410 --> 01:37:27.890]  They packed a Lord of the Rings into an hour and 38 minutes.
[01:37:30.650 --> 01:37:31.590]  God damn.
[01:37:33.970 --> 01:37:36.150]  Those additional 18 years
[01:37:36.150 --> 01:37:37.690]  didn't do anything for me.
[01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:39.470]  Since it came out.
[01:37:40.010 --> 01:37:42.030]  Imagining 18 years ago
[01:37:42.030 --> 01:37:43.970]  you being so disappointed
[01:37:43.970 --> 01:37:45.850]  right now. The most disappointed you've ever...
[01:37:45.850 --> 01:37:47.630]  You were so excited. You pre-ordered it.
[01:37:48.090 --> 01:37:48.990]  Ready to go.
[01:37:50.770 --> 01:37:52.390]  And the exact same feeling.
[01:37:53.410 --> 01:37:54.810]  Should we rate this film
[01:37:54.810 --> 01:37:56.610]  in some way? Or do we not care?
[01:37:58.910 --> 01:38:01.030]  Rate it out of five
[01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:01.710]  tuxedos.
[01:38:02.230 --> 01:38:04.970]  I give it two and a half
[01:38:04.970 --> 01:38:06.470]  hooter wings out of ten.
[01:38:06.910 --> 01:38:08.910]  I give it four water striders.
[01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:16.850]  I'm just... I'm gonna give it
[01:38:18.510 --> 01:38:19.210]  one
[01:38:19.210 --> 01:38:20.390]  Peter Stormare.
[01:38:23.690 --> 01:38:24.810]  Nick or Eric?
[01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:27.090]  I mean, I think you guys
[01:38:27.090 --> 01:38:27.890]  really summed it up.
[01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:30.550]  Like, I will give it
[01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:33.110]  I'll give it .5 blooper reels
[01:38:33.110 --> 01:38:35.010]  because that didn't feel like a whole one.
[01:38:35.150 --> 01:38:36.050]  There you go.
[01:38:36.450 --> 01:38:38.230]  I'll give it one deer pissing in a river.
[01:38:39.250 --> 01:38:40.490]  One deer piss.
[01:38:42.630 --> 01:38:44.570]  Nick's only contribution
[01:38:44.570 --> 01:38:46.250]  to the whole thing.
[01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:50.840]  I hope to God
[01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:53.320]  a regulation listener or comment
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:53.700]  leaver
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.400]  makes a tuxedo poster
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:59.080]  with all those rings on it.
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:02.920]  Like a four year consideration type thing?
[01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:05.300]  Well, we did it.
[01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:06.140]  We watched a movie together.
[01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:08.780]  How long did it take us to do this?
[01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:11.180]  A couple hours?
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:12.800]  No, I mean,
[01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:15.000]  Geoff, I didn't think that's what you were asking.
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:18.500]  I got where you were.
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:19.900]  Me and you, bud.
[01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:23.500]  Fucking idiots.
[01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:25.980]  When was this idea
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:27.520]  presented to
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:29.500]  when we made the fucking video?
[01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:31.480]  Did it take us two months?
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:32.040]  Three months?
[01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:35.540]  I think it was probably a little over a month.
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:37.320]  But now we know that we can do it.
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:39.620]  We know how to do it. We've got all the kinks worked out.
[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:41.540]  So next time you decide
[01:39:41.540 --> 01:39:43.100]  to think of a movie you saw
[01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:45.480]  13 years ago and you want
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:47.820]  to watch it again, you let me know and I'll get it
[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:48.500]  ready to go.
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:51.160]  I think that's great. And can I just say
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:53.460]  thank you guys for continuing to innovate.
[01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:54.800]  I was just counting it up in my head.
[01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:56.840]  This is the fourth kind
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:58.600]  of alternate
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:00.880]  shoulder sub
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:02.960]  bonus content we've made.
[01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:03.880]  The FFU.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.080]  We've made the Break Show, right?
[01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:09.040]  We've done food review shows.
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:10.100]  We've done Apple reviews.
[01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:13.040]  We've done Andrew ask Andrew
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:14.740]  a bunch of sad questions about his life.
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:15.700]  And then this.
[01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:19.320]  Now we watch movies together.
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:21.140]  Four different kinds
[01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:23.340]  of innovative pieces of content. I'm just happy
[01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:24.660]  that this many... already
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:27.500]  into season four of this show
[01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:29.040]  and we're still coming up with new ideas.
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:31.180]  So Pat, you guys all in the back.
[01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:31.680]  Congratulations.
[01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:35.080]  I'd like to know when was the last time someone watched
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:35.680]  the Tuxedo.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.320]  No one's made content about the Tuxedo.
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:41.300]  Who's making content about the Tuxedo
[01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:43.280]  but us? Do you think that was the first stream on
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:44.320]  HBO Go that it got?
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:45.900]  It has to.
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.260]  Do you think it ticked an alarm
[01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:48.700]  somewhere?
[01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:52.000]  There's a light going off at Jackie Chan's
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.980]  house and he is very confused as to why.
[01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:55.840]  It was installed 18 years ago. Nobody
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:57.740]  has hit play on the Tuxedo
[01:40:57.740 --> 01:40:58.600]  since you bought it.
[01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:01.860]  The golden water strider on his desk
[01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:02.480]  just lit up.
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:07.260]  Alright, well,
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:09.980]  I think that should probably do it.
[01:41:10.580 --> 01:41:11.860]  Let us know what you
[01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:13.760]  thought about that. Unless you didn't like it.
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:15.620]  And if you didn't like it, that's fucking awesome.
[01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:17.800]  Just don't tell us. But if you did like it
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:19.420]  and you want us to do it again, let us know.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.240]  Yeah, which movie do you want next?
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:23.820]  Yeah, movie or TV show, pilot,
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:25.720]  reality show. You can say none if you want.
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:27.480]  Yeah, none is an answer.
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:29.720]  None is an answer. But maybe
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:31.600]  you all want us to watch more Bob movies.
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:33.940]  Or maybe you want us to watch more Danny Trejo content.
[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:35.420]  We're down for whatever.
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:38.120]  I am always
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:39.820]  willing to take
[01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:41.520]  a ride back in time and hang out with
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:42.700]  Arthur Fonzarelli.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:43.760]  Just saying.
[01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:47.720]  You really want us to watch Happy Days?
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:49.280]  I watched a lot of
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:50.780]  Happy Days when I was a kid.
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:52.040]  I was of that era.
[01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:54.940]  Ta-ta. Bye now.
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:55.900]  Bye.
