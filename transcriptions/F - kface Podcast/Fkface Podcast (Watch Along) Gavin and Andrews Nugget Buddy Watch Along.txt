[00:00.000 --> 00:00.440]  You ready to go?
[00:00.600 --> 00:01.880]  The printer is a piece of shit.
[00:02.540 --> 00:03.840]  Your printer's a piece of shit?
[00:03.960 --> 00:04.700]  It's a piece of shit!
[00:05.260 --> 00:06.580]  You know what else is a piece of shit?
[00:06.660 --> 00:11.320]  These nugget buddies that I can't get, which is why we're here watching this stream.
[00:11.920 --> 00:13.480]  You don't like the nugget buddies, Gavin.
[00:13.640 --> 00:14.600]  I've been obsessed with them.
[00:14.780 --> 00:17.340]  I just don't know what the goddamn any of it means or is.
[00:18.060 --> 00:18.840]  What's a nugget, boy?
[00:18.880 --> 00:19.320]  What is it?
[00:19.380 --> 00:20.820]  It's a nugget and it's a buddy.
[00:21.020 --> 00:21.660]  It's a friend.
[00:21.960 --> 00:22.300]  But what-
[00:22.300 --> 00:23.380]  I don't think it could be more clear.
[00:23.740 --> 00:26.820]  What's a kershal flambe or whatever those things are.
[00:27.600 --> 00:28.740]  What the fuck is a kers-
[00:28.740 --> 00:29.880]  I don't even know what you're talking-
[00:29.880 --> 00:31.200]  A kershal flambe?
[00:31.360 --> 00:33.120]  Whatever the hell you said it was.
[00:33.280 --> 00:34.340]  What are the things?
[00:35.440 --> 00:36.140]  The nugget buddies?
[00:36.440 --> 00:36.640]  Yeah.
[00:37.660 --> 00:39.060]  Uh, oh, we got Uptown Moe.
[00:39.120 --> 00:40.180]  We got Kerwin Frost-
[00:40.180 --> 00:40.680]  That was it.
[00:40.680 --> 00:42.800]  Kershan flambe was Kerwin Frost!
[00:43.560 --> 00:44.300]  There we go.
[00:44.840 --> 00:45.560]  Oh my God.
[00:46.040 --> 00:49.840]  Uh, so I guess for some context, we're watching The Break Show, which feels very meta.
[00:50.180 --> 00:53.220]  I'm recording through my Xbox like it's a Let's Play, which is dumb.
[00:53.600 --> 00:58.240]  And I mailed Geoff like 20 unopened nugget buddies from my collection.
[00:58.360 --> 00:59.440]  I'm missing two, Gavin.
[00:59.440 --> 01:01.960]  I need the Kerwin Frost and I need Darla.
[01:02.460 --> 01:03.980]  So that's what we're hoping to see get pulled.
[01:04.340 --> 01:04.760]  How do-
[01:04.760 --> 01:06.660]  And you'll know them when you see them, I assume.
[01:06.960 --> 01:08.200]  I'll know them when I see them.
[01:08.260 --> 01:09.320]  Yeah, I'll call them out for you.
[01:09.420 --> 01:13.600]  We'll give updates to people at home can watch along as this will be video as well as audio.
[01:14.360 --> 01:15.960]  I'm excited to see what happens here.
[01:16.120 --> 01:25.760]  We also don't know how long this will be because Geoff typically does some bullshit at the start of the show and then he'll do unboxings like this might be very short or he might be an asshole and wait until the very end.
[01:26.920 --> 01:28.700]  Does he know we're doing this?
[01:29.440 --> 01:30.040]  He does.
[01:30.300 --> 01:30.440]  Okay.
[01:30.560 --> 01:30.680]  Yeah.
[01:31.340 --> 01:32.080]  Oh, here we go.
[01:34.500 --> 01:35.380]  Welcome to another-
[01:35.380 --> 01:36.540]  Oh, how do you turn it up?
[01:36.680 --> 01:37.600]  My name is Geoff Williams.
[01:38.480 --> 01:40.340]  Let me, let me turn up my balance.
[01:43.060 --> 01:44.800]  I made that really quiet.
[01:45.000 --> 01:45.740]  Oh, Eric's hyper.
[01:45.880 --> 01:46.280]  Look at him.
[01:46.740 --> 01:48.300]  Oh, he's like a little monkey.
[01:48.460 --> 01:49.440]  He's like bouncing around.
[01:51.300 --> 01:56.260]  I'm immediately concerned, Gavin, because I don't see a nugget buddy on that table at all.
[01:57.080 --> 01:58.680]  Well, maybe he's got them in a box somewhere.
[01:59.360 --> 02:00.360]  Geoff Ramsey, huh?
[02:00.600 --> 02:04.340]  That's true, but there's a lot of shit on that table and I don't see it.
[02:04.420 --> 02:06.120]  I see a bunch of Ramsey photos.
[02:06.380 --> 02:07.840]  I see Barbies.
[02:08.800 --> 02:12.580]  That show set makes sense when you know the show.
[02:12.680 --> 02:14.940]  But if you just tuned into this, man, what a mess.
[02:15.620 --> 02:19.120]  It looks like somebody fired a shotgun of random shit.
[02:19.740 --> 02:22.520]  And it's like everyone lives in a big pallet.
[02:25.320 --> 02:27.780]  It's like a storage locker, like you'd find
[02:27.780 --> 02:30.340]  in somebody bought with random assortments of collectibles.
[02:30.860 --> 02:33.240]  Yeah, it's like a real dud storage, you know, storage.
[02:33.420 --> 02:35.520]  Yes. Yeah, I do.
[02:35.900 --> 02:37.120]  And I feel like I got to dig myself.
[02:37.200 --> 02:37.740]  I'm really worried.
[02:37.840 --> 02:40.160]  I haven't actually listened to it on the I haven't.
[02:40.240 --> 02:41.520]  No, the face drawing in the back.
[02:41.600 --> 02:43.100]  Or I like I'm a fan of that.
[02:43.280 --> 02:44.000]  Did people fuck?
[02:44.200 --> 02:45.580]  Oh, my God. No, some of it.
[02:45.600 --> 02:46.700]  I don't get like the gremlins.
[02:47.060 --> 02:48.180]  Nothing against gremlins.
[02:48.340 --> 02:49.400]  I miss the gremlins.
[02:50.480 --> 02:52.960]  Barbara, Eric's small wife and my friend Vanessa,
[02:53.080 --> 02:55.480]  tell me about all the dirty little books that they read.
[02:55.480 --> 02:56.520]  I don't people.
[02:56.820 --> 02:57.720]  I don't know how that's.
[02:57.740 --> 02:59.800]  Did you ever figure out what Geoff does in this?
[02:59.980 --> 03:01.400]  Remember, he told us he's done for a living.
[03:01.540 --> 03:02.060]  No one's noticed.
[03:02.640 --> 03:04.020]  No, nobody does for a living.
[03:04.840 --> 03:05.420]  Oh, shit.
[03:05.640 --> 03:07.060]  Oh, we got an ad break.
[03:10.200 --> 03:11.540]  Skip. Wow.
[03:11.680 --> 03:12.680]  For a second ad.
[03:15.960 --> 03:19.580]  I'll tell you something that that I mildly am annoyed about with the show.
[03:21.400 --> 03:21.900]  What's that?
[03:22.620 --> 03:24.960]  I'll let you know when we get we need to go see the wide.
[03:24.960 --> 03:25.800]  Yeah, right there.
[03:26.240 --> 03:28.220]  I'm the only one blocked out on that Zimmer.
[03:28.440 --> 03:29.500]  Boys, the Zimmer poster.
[03:30.020 --> 03:31.240]  The only one not seen.
[03:31.500 --> 03:32.440]  Where's the block me out?
[03:32.900 --> 03:34.600]  Yeah, look up to the left when they go wide.
[03:34.700 --> 03:36.440]  The mannequin fucking cut me out.
[03:36.520 --> 03:37.800]  I'm getting shoved out by the mannequin.
[03:41.720 --> 03:42.580]  They're talking about you.
[03:43.140 --> 03:44.300]  They are finally.
[03:44.760 --> 03:45.980]  Oh, they're the nugget buddies.
[03:46.960 --> 03:48.060]  He's going to get straight to it.
[03:49.060 --> 03:50.100]  I hope he does.
[03:50.220 --> 03:50.960]  They were there in a box.
[03:51.080 --> 03:51.620]  Oh, yeah, you are.
[03:51.680 --> 03:52.460]  You're cut out by me.
[03:52.560 --> 03:53.260]  I thought I had more.
[03:55.860 --> 03:57.420]  Oh, look, let me let me watch the feed.
[03:57.560 --> 03:59.500]  You fucking dick, Geoff.
[03:59.680 --> 04:01.820]  I don't want to watch the whole break show.
[04:02.040 --> 04:02.840]  You asshole.
[04:03.420 --> 04:04.220]  Oh, man.
[04:04.480 --> 04:06.940]  I love the break show, but I'm so sorry.
[04:10.740 --> 04:13.120]  Oh, what a dick.
[04:13.320 --> 04:14.420]  He knows what we're going to have to watch.
[04:14.660 --> 04:19.020]  He knows he's going to make us watch us fucking go through some Lion King cards.
[04:19.520 --> 04:21.620]  Look, we have some of the
[04:22.660 --> 04:24.060]  best commentary content.
[04:24.060 --> 04:24.860]  All right.
[04:24.880 --> 04:27.600]  No one comments on their own content as much as we do.
[04:28.560 --> 04:29.340]  It's true.
[04:30.020 --> 04:32.420]  Well, maybe we can have some fun facts about whatever they're.
[04:32.540 --> 04:33.020]  I don't even know.
[04:33.080 --> 04:34.400]  It's all American stuff, typically.
[04:35.960 --> 04:36.840]  Perot's VP.
[04:37.220 --> 04:38.660]  That's a detective, right?
[04:39.060 --> 04:40.440]  It's a card of billionaires.
[04:43.140 --> 04:44.680]  One nine and a half.
[04:45.360 --> 04:46.240]  Ninety two.
[04:47.160 --> 04:49.780]  Is it billionaire the type of card or is that person a billionaire?
[04:50.380 --> 04:51.320]  I don't know.
[04:51.360 --> 04:52.860]  Is Ross Perot a person?
[04:52.860 --> 04:54.580]  That's a person's name, right?
[04:54.960 --> 04:55.400]  I don't know.
[04:55.500 --> 04:56.820]  You know who Ross Perot is?
[04:57.280 --> 04:57.560]  No.
[04:58.600 --> 05:01.480]  I think that's Perot's VP selection.
[05:03.180 --> 05:03.580]  Oh, Hark.
[05:04.560 --> 05:05.260]  I don't.
[05:05.380 --> 05:06.020]  This is great.
[05:06.320 --> 05:09.280]  What a fucking qualified thing for you and I to talk about.
[05:09.420 --> 05:10.760]  U.S. political.
[05:10.940 --> 05:12.800]  Nothing like the 92 political race.
[05:14.280 --> 05:15.240]  I actually like that card.
[05:18.620 --> 05:20.040]  What do you wear that hat?
[05:20.760 --> 05:21.640]  I'd give it a go. Yeah.
[05:22.100 --> 05:26.100]  Yeah, I think that would at least constitute as a goofy hat and a sloppy joe string.
[05:26.900 --> 05:28.440]  The Electoral College.
[05:31.840 --> 05:36.000]  This I'm hoping for a gerrymandering card to pop up.
[05:36.240 --> 05:39.060]  Yeah, I'm looking for a half chad card.
[05:39.760 --> 05:42.620]  I think that was the thing, right, with the Al Gore election
[05:42.620 --> 05:45.140]  where it was like it wasn't fully hole punched or whatever.
[05:45.280 --> 05:46.260]  So they called it a half chad.
[05:46.420 --> 05:47.260]  Oh, the hanging chad?
[05:48.280 --> 05:49.540]  Hanging chad, yeah.
[05:50.680 --> 05:51.520]  Half chad.
[05:53.160 --> 05:54.940]  Didn't work out well for either of those.
[05:56.040 --> 05:56.480]  No.
[05:59.440 --> 06:01.100]  I don't know any of these people.
[06:01.920 --> 06:03.780]  That guy has NHL manager energy.
[06:05.640 --> 06:07.540]  Oh, Richard Nixon.
[06:07.800 --> 06:08.120]  Oh, we got to.
[06:08.260 --> 06:09.560]  Oh, dude, we got to fucking.
[06:09.900 --> 06:10.780]  The original gate.
[06:11.260 --> 06:11.780]  We got a.
[06:13.720 --> 06:14.360]  Is he?
[06:15.560 --> 06:16.760]  Watergate was a big one.
[06:16.860 --> 06:17.700]  Wait, it just says.
[06:17.700 --> 06:19.700]  What? Why is Magic Johnson?
[06:20.320 --> 06:21.360]  It doesn't say his name.
[06:22.320 --> 06:22.600]  What?
[06:25.060 --> 06:27.980]  It just says AIDS in a picture of Magic Johnson.
[06:29.160 --> 06:31.700]  Well, he's got that billionaire AIDS, Gavin.
[06:32.180 --> 06:33.320]  What the fuck's going on?
[06:33.900 --> 06:36.220]  I don't think he would have approved that card.
[06:36.780 --> 06:39.320]  Was it just a cultural pack or?
[06:40.200 --> 06:42.900]  That's also a great question of do you need approval for these things?
[06:42.980 --> 06:43.500]  Like, could you?
[06:43.840 --> 06:47.160]  I think if you took a major sports star and wrote AIDS on him
[06:47.160 --> 06:48.440]  and put it on a card, he would be.
[06:55.390 --> 07:00.110]  She looks like a librarian and like a soap opera TV show.
[07:00.910 --> 07:01.530]  That's true.
[07:01.770 --> 07:03.610]  Like some Gilmore Girls ass.
[07:03.990 --> 07:06.170]  She looks like everyone who told me to shut up as a kid.
[07:16.580 --> 07:17.820]  We have a cabinet.
[07:18.620 --> 07:20.240]  See, look, look the wide shot, Gavin.
[07:20.520 --> 07:21.020]  I'm blocked.
[07:21.340 --> 07:22.380]  Yeah, I'm getting squeezed.
[07:23.320 --> 07:24.860]  After I do the pack sack.
[07:25.060 --> 07:25.920]  But you're already there.
[07:26.460 --> 07:28.200]  Yeah, but I'm also on the other thing for some reason.
[07:28.920 --> 07:30.340]  Yeah, and it's like the R.T.
[07:30.400 --> 07:35.640]  podcast bit of Geoff, Geoff, Gavin or Gavin, Geoff, Eric and Gavin.
[07:35.840 --> 07:40.560]  We need to take the cardboard face off and put the balaclava on, I think.
[07:43.860 --> 07:47.660]  I keep looking at that that video of Geoff's
[07:47.660 --> 07:50.240]  getting his nose through that thing, and it kills me.
[07:50.580 --> 07:53.680]  I think I might find that funnier than any other person on the planet.
[07:53.820 --> 07:56.500]  I can't stop hilariously laughing.
[07:56.500 --> 07:58.020]  I found it pretty funny at the time.
[07:58.540 --> 08:01.320]  You did. And you I think you elevate the moment quite a bit.
[08:03.580 --> 08:04.760]  How was your weekend?
[08:06.200 --> 08:07.640]  We don't need to react to this.
[08:07.720 --> 08:08.820]  We could say, fuck you to Geoff.
[08:08.940 --> 08:10.540]  We can just do our own thing while this is playing.
[08:10.900 --> 08:12.420]  Why was your weekend dog shit? What happened?
[08:13.020 --> 08:13.900]  I was just editing.
[08:14.020 --> 08:15.640]  I was editing for like the whole time.
[08:16.640 --> 08:19.220]  Oh, the stuff you filmed on Friday or slow-mo stuff?
[08:19.580 --> 08:20.940]  The stuff, slow-mo.
[08:21.280 --> 08:23.140]  I haven't even started the stuff we filmed the other day.
[08:24.160 --> 08:25.260]  I'm excited to hear about it.
[08:25.260 --> 08:27.400]  It's good that we filmed four videos on Friday.
[08:27.680 --> 08:28.720]  Four supplementals.
[08:30.100 --> 08:30.960]  That's exciting.
[08:33.580 --> 08:38.420]  I, uh, I'm excited for when we record on Thursday,
[08:38.640 --> 08:41.320]  I'm assuming, because I've got some stories.
[08:41.980 --> 08:42.860]  Oh, some stuff's happened.
[08:43.440 --> 08:46.600]  Some stuff has happened in my life that is not not fun.
[08:46.720 --> 08:47.860]  But I think you'll laugh at it.
[08:48.160 --> 08:49.660]  Oh, definitely. I can't wait.
[08:50.440 --> 08:50.620]  What?
[08:50.840 --> 08:53.920]  I got a grade one hamstring injury.
[08:55.380 --> 08:58.780]  I'll let you try to figure out how between now and then you can make a guess
[08:58.780 --> 09:00.480]  as to how I accomplished my grade one.
[09:00.760 --> 09:02.500]  Well, you've clearly slipped on something in the bedroom.
[09:05.840 --> 09:09.880]  I will say I tweeted about it and I said, if anyone gets it right,
[09:09.900 --> 09:10.580]  I'll give them a prize.
[09:10.680 --> 09:15.700]  And so far, nobody has a few close guesses, but no one has gotten it exactly.
[09:16.480 --> 09:16.760]  Hmm.
[09:18.720 --> 09:19.100]  Hmm.
[09:20.880 --> 09:23.060]  What year of the animal were you born?
[09:23.060 --> 09:24.180]  Don't you have season tickets?
[09:24.480 --> 09:27.360]  That is a fucking...
[09:27.360 --> 09:30.980]  This is creepy that you asked me that question because it's part of what I was going to talk about.
[09:31.060 --> 09:32.080]  I am I'm a Leo.
[09:32.800 --> 09:33.620]  What about you?
[09:35.340 --> 09:36.140]  You're a Leo?
[09:36.940 --> 09:39.260]  Yeah. Or whatever that is.
[09:40.160 --> 09:41.360]  Dog? Am I a dog?
[09:41.700 --> 09:43.180]  Well, it's dependent on the year you were born.
[09:43.900 --> 09:45.320]  I'm 94. Let me look it up.
[09:45.740 --> 09:48.040]  I'm the dragon. I think I'm an earth dragon.
[09:48.460 --> 09:50.580]  That? Oh, you're a dragon?
[09:50.900 --> 09:52.880]  And it's dragon again this year, which means...
[09:52.880 --> 09:54.440]  It is. I think it's bad.
[09:55.600 --> 09:56.900]  No, for me, it is.
[09:57.520 --> 09:59.320]  That. Oh, you're you and I are enemies.
[10:01.400 --> 10:05.280]  What year was the year of 1994?
[10:07.960 --> 10:09.000]  Let me look it up.
[10:10.260 --> 10:12.140]  Dog. So I'm a dog.
[10:12.400 --> 10:13.280]  You're a dragon.
[10:13.940 --> 10:16.220]  My rival symbol is the dragon.
[10:16.560 --> 10:17.740]  You and I have beef.
[10:18.440 --> 10:22.420]  We're just like we're two wolves chasing each other around the moon or whatever.
[10:22.880 --> 10:25.700]  We are. But like months ago,
[10:26.360 --> 10:31.440]  I saw I found when I was scrolling on TikTok, this like ridiculous crypto bro
[10:31.440 --> 10:35.960]  who uses like astrology to to make crypto predictions
[10:35.960 --> 10:37.440]  and like just general things.
[10:37.600 --> 10:40.760]  And he did a breakdown on what it means for a dragon year.
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.900]  And he was like, if you're if you're a dog, you got to fucking watch out.
[10:45.000 --> 10:45.880]  It's your enemy's year.
[10:46.280 --> 10:47.420]  You got to watch these dragons.
[10:47.840 --> 10:49.380]  You're going to have a bad year.
[10:49.460 --> 10:50.840]  So you got to like try to stay out.
[10:50.840 --> 10:54.880]  And I don't believe any of that stuff, but I also fully believe all of it.
[10:55.880 --> 11:00.260]  So as soon as I hurt myself, the first thing I thought was fucking dragons.
[11:00.580 --> 11:02.220]  This is I got to I got to be careful.
[11:02.820 --> 11:03.840]  We're in the dragon year.
[11:03.940 --> 11:05.100]  This is going to be your pain for me.
[11:05.100 --> 11:06.180]  Potentially, I got to lay low.
[11:06.800 --> 11:08.160]  I can't believe you're a dragon.
[11:08.640 --> 11:10.060]  Yeah, you wouldn't you wouldn't look.
[11:10.220 --> 11:11.360]  You wouldn't know it to look at me. What?
[11:11.780 --> 11:13.540]  No, I don't know that phrase.
[11:13.600 --> 11:14.480]  You know any of these guys?
[11:15.760 --> 11:16.120]  No.
[11:18.780 --> 11:21.800]  You and I played cricket.
[11:21.940 --> 11:22.280]  Yeah, we did.
[11:23.200 --> 11:27.360]  Would you consider football as like that's also another
[11:27.900 --> 11:29.380]  I'd say European sport, right?
[11:29.420 --> 11:30.760]  What else do you this polo?
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.580]  I feel like polo is like a proper British thing.
[11:34.700 --> 11:35.100]  Golf.
[11:36.440 --> 11:38.480]  Just a normal golf, you think is British?
[11:38.760 --> 11:40.080]  Oh, it's Scottish, isn't it? Golf?
[11:40.860 --> 11:42.500]  I guess. Yeah, but I don't know.
[11:42.720 --> 11:45.080]  Invented in rugby, which is in England.
[11:46.880 --> 11:50.980]  I guess it's like you don't necessarily think of basketball as a Canadian sport,
[11:51.100 --> 11:52.020]  but it was made in Canada.
[11:52.360 --> 11:52.660]  Oh, really?
[11:52.740 --> 11:54.800]  I don't think necessarily where it was made.
[11:57.540 --> 11:59.620]  Details exactly like culturally where it's aligned.
[12:00.720 --> 12:04.020]  Like hockey, undeniably Canadian, but I would say basketball is American.
[12:05.660 --> 12:07.440]  Yeah, seems bigger in America.
[12:09.180 --> 12:13.160]  I was just trying to think of other British games that we could play that I could try to beat you at.
[12:13.680 --> 12:15.820]  I looked and they don't have a polo game.
[12:15.980 --> 12:16.880]  Which is shocking.
[12:17.200 --> 12:18.320]  Do they have a croquet game?
[12:21.300 --> 12:22.180]  I don't...
[12:23.100 --> 12:24.760]  Let me look it up.
[12:29.400 --> 12:31.680]  It's just mini golf croquet, essentially, right?
[12:31.760 --> 12:33.420]  Like there's no... Well, there's one on Steam.
[12:34.760 --> 12:37.360]  I don't think there's ever been a console croquet game.
[12:37.480 --> 12:37.840]  Oh!
[12:39.180 --> 12:40.540]  Oh, wait a second.
[12:43.160 --> 12:45.320]  It is on console. Does it have online multiplayer?
[12:47.640 --> 12:50.640]  Made by Top Secret Studios, which makes sense as to why.
[12:51.240 --> 12:52.040]  Well, you can't find it.
[12:52.500 --> 12:53.820]  Yeah, it's a secret thing.
[12:54.100 --> 12:57.000]  Oh, my God, Gavin, this this game.
[12:57.900 --> 12:59.300]  This looks like something.
[12:59.420 --> 13:02.680]  There's no way it's just local multiplayer.
[13:04.480 --> 13:07.100]  Damn. Well, maybe we'll look into this more.
[13:07.220 --> 13:09.400]  Maybe when there's an office day, you guys can play.
[13:10.720 --> 13:12.440]  You challenge somebody else to.
[13:13.280 --> 13:14.740]  The national game.
[13:20.640 --> 13:24.640]  Oh, Bedard.
[13:24.880 --> 13:27.440]  Do you know anything about Conor Bedard, Gavin?
[13:28.080 --> 13:28.280]  No.
[13:29.100 --> 13:34.680]  Conor Bedard is the hockey player that was drafted first overall in the most recent draft.
[13:34.840 --> 13:37.000]  And he is known as like an all star.
[13:37.260 --> 13:39.900]  He is he is supposed to be a generational talent.
[13:40.620 --> 13:44.960]  And he is part of my favorite drama story of 2023,
[13:45.640 --> 13:49.000]  where they brought in this this veteran player named Corey Perry
[13:49.520 --> 13:53.940]  that management said at the time he was brought in intended to be sort of like a
[13:53.940 --> 13:57.880]  a father figure for Bedard to guide him in his rookie season.
[13:58.100 --> 14:01.580]  Sort of sort of show him the ropes, you may say.
[14:01.900 --> 14:06.820]  And then suddenly in the middle of the season or early in the season, I guess
[14:07.600 --> 14:10.700]  he Corey, Corey Perry was released from the team.
[14:11.180 --> 14:15.520]  And the rumor that generated online instantly was that Corey Perry
[14:15.520 --> 14:19.820]  fucked Bedard's mom at a during the all moms trip
[14:19.820 --> 14:21.200]  when they were with the team.
[14:21.380 --> 14:23.560]  And that is why he was released by the team.
[14:23.800 --> 14:26.140]  It was a big story for a while.
[14:26.240 --> 14:29.300]  And people have denied that that's the case.
[14:29.300 --> 14:32.820]  But I continue to believe that he fucked Bedard's mom.
[14:32.960 --> 14:33.900]  I mean, you would hope so, right?
[14:34.520 --> 14:36.960]  You would. I mean, it would be so great if he did.
[14:37.760 --> 14:39.980]  Apparently it was something related with alcohol.
[14:40.120 --> 14:42.360]  I don't think the full story has ever truly come out.
[14:42.840 --> 14:46.580]  But he Corey Perry just got re-signed to a different team over this weekend.
[14:47.100 --> 14:48.840]  So he's back. He's back on the field.
[14:50.680 --> 14:51.760]  Or I guess ice.
[14:51.880 --> 14:54.320]  Nobody says there's not really a field in hockey, that was bad.
[14:55.580 --> 14:57.120]  Well, in field hockey, there's a field.
[14:57.720 --> 14:58.420]  That's true.
[14:58.820 --> 15:00.720]  Which I just I wonder if call hockey.
[15:00.720 --> 15:01.460]  And that's how that works.
[15:02.300 --> 15:03.820]  Oh, really? That's your default hockey?
[15:04.020 --> 15:05.280]  Yeah, hockey for me is like
[15:06.280 --> 15:09.440]  being cold on a school morning, whipping
[15:10.500 --> 15:12.100]  people's shins with wooden sticks.
[15:12.280 --> 15:15.900]  And every time two sticks hit, it vibrated my hands in the cold.
[15:16.220 --> 15:16.800]  It sucked.
[15:17.380 --> 15:19.780]  Wait, wait, they're doing the double fronts.
[15:21.700 --> 15:24.480]  Oh, is there an update on this or are we doing this?
[15:26.260 --> 15:27.760]  Or is he just showing off the double fronts?
[15:30.840 --> 15:32.760]  Oh, I think he's just showing off the double fronts.
[15:32.920 --> 15:34.080]  How are they together so well?
[15:35.480 --> 15:37.200]  It's I don't know.
[15:39.620 --> 15:43.940]  I love your idea of the inside out shirts as well.
[15:44.020 --> 15:47.740]  But there's an image on the backpack shirt on everything.
[15:48.220 --> 15:49.340]  It's too back.
[15:50.440 --> 15:52.100]  It's so dumb.
[15:55.140 --> 15:58.940]  The back design is always such a thrown together thing.
[15:58.940 --> 16:00.660]  Like there's so much little effort.
[16:01.280 --> 16:03.540]  Like the least effort is always put in the back design.
[16:03.700 --> 16:05.560]  The idea that it's double backs is so funny.
[16:06.120 --> 16:07.360]  Backpack would be great on a hoodie.
[16:09.040 --> 16:10.620]  Backpack would be really funny on a hoodie.
[16:14.400 --> 16:19.840]  I think it would be really funny if it was like.
[16:21.640 --> 16:25.500]  If it was like your guys' waxing face front and back,
[16:25.500 --> 16:28.300]  and then like maybe my mustache face on one of the inside,
[16:28.300 --> 16:33.160]  like just the most horrific, no matter what way you put it on, it's a nightmare.
[16:36.800 --> 16:39.280]  I guess people haven't seen the front front shirt.
[16:39.440 --> 16:40.500]  That doesn't look bad.
[16:40.620 --> 16:42.260]  He just looks like he works somewhere.
[16:43.140 --> 16:45.420]  Yeah, he does. He works at that bar.
[16:46.060 --> 16:48.340]  He looks like an NPC in a Hitman game.
[16:48.640 --> 16:51.940]  Yeah, like he's just a guy walking around that's doing like electrical stuff.
[16:52.140 --> 16:54.280]  He's the guy that you could just shove down a manhole
[16:54.280 --> 16:56.180]  and it wouldn't have any impact on the mission.
[16:56.700 --> 17:00.520]  Yeah, he is the guy you used to get the outfit to enter the area
[17:00.520 --> 17:02.320]  to first start the level.
[17:02.520 --> 17:05.000]  The poor bastard they've got leaning over a crate
[17:06.140 --> 17:07.840]  fucking around without any witnesses.
[17:08.260 --> 17:10.820]  Yeah, I was sold on it, but I never thought about that.
[17:10.860 --> 17:14.720]  But there are absolutely those guys in every level of Hitman.
[17:14.820 --> 17:19.060]  I wonder creatively, that must be so fun being like, OK, so who is this bastard?
[17:19.300 --> 17:21.980]  That's going to be the most kill.
[17:22.420 --> 17:25.280]  We should walk around each map and find the sorriest bastard.
[17:25.280 --> 17:27.120]  That's such a funny idea.
[17:28.640 --> 17:30.180]  Let's do that. We can compare.
[17:30.480 --> 17:34.120]  Maybe we like scout and show each other who we think and see if we agree
[17:34.120 --> 17:35.440]  on who the sorriest bastard is.
[17:35.520 --> 17:36.200]  We should do that.
[17:36.660 --> 17:37.640]  Oh, that's so funny.
[17:40.600 --> 17:41.620]  Does Xbox still...
[17:41.620 --> 17:44.080]  Remember when you could like snap in a different app?
[17:44.980 --> 17:46.060]  No, they got rid of that.
[17:46.200 --> 17:48.320]  They got rid of that a long time ago because no one used it.
[17:49.000 --> 17:50.400]  Well, I feel like people would have used it,
[17:50.440 --> 17:53.000]  but it turned the frame rate of the game down that you were playing.
[17:53.880 --> 17:55.800]  It also like wasn't big enough.
[17:56.220 --> 18:00.840]  Like it was a panel and you'd get like a postage stamp of the panel
[18:00.840 --> 18:02.560]  would be what your screen would be.
[18:02.600 --> 18:05.820]  It made no sense that it was the whole height of the screen
[18:05.820 --> 18:09.680]  when all you needed was like a PIP situation.
[18:10.400 --> 18:13.180]  Yeah, like if they could have made it adjustable, that would have been amazing.
[18:15.300 --> 18:16.240]  But why do you ask?
[18:16.700 --> 18:17.820]  You're just thinking like split screen?
[18:18.920 --> 18:21.860]  Yeah, like being able to look up stuff as a...
[18:23.300 --> 18:25.240]  As they pull stuff like who that woman was.
[18:27.400 --> 18:29.060]  Oh, for me, I see what you're saying.
[18:29.340 --> 18:31.060]  Yeah, no, that's that's long gone.
[18:32.300 --> 18:34.320]  It's weird the stuff they took out.
[18:36.880 --> 18:41.200]  Yeah, it's like the fact that the Kinect just doesn't work at all
[18:41.200 --> 18:43.200]  on modern consoles is such a strange thing.
[18:43.400 --> 18:45.860]  But that was never a good replacement for the voice thing,
[18:45.920 --> 18:48.740]  like being able to turn your Xbox on and off by talking.
[18:49.060 --> 18:49.940]  That was pretty good.
[18:50.840 --> 18:51.900]  I never used it,
[18:51.900 --> 18:54.620]  but I know a lot of people like you that loved it.
[18:55.820 --> 18:57.940]  You know what else they got rid of that they should have never
[18:58.580 --> 18:59.980]  got rid of speaking of voices?
[19:00.400 --> 19:04.740]  Do you remember on the original Xbox for Xbox Live,
[19:04.820 --> 19:09.060]  you could do voice masking that they had a built-in voice mask you could do?
[19:11.480 --> 19:12.180]  Could you really?
[19:12.660 --> 19:14.180]  Yeah, you don't remember that?
[19:14.520 --> 19:18.940]  It was part of the advertising for it of like where they don't know
[19:18.940 --> 19:20.780]  what the future will be, but they're trying to guess.
[19:20.780 --> 19:22.520]  And one of the angles was like,
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.640]  you could play games online and hide your identity
[19:25.640 --> 19:27.600]  so they don't even recognize your voice.
[19:27.700 --> 19:30.440]  And it was just the shittiest voice masker.
[19:30.760 --> 19:32.180]  It was like if you tried, it would be like,
[19:33.020 --> 19:35.620]  The robot, they're taking the flag!
[19:36.120 --> 19:37.860]  The flag, the flag is still there!
[19:38.220 --> 19:40.640]  Like it was just muffled and sounded like shit.
[19:42.320 --> 19:44.020]  I'll have to send it to you, a clip of.
[19:44.060 --> 19:46.440]  I'm sure there's someone's clipped what that thing said.
[19:46.520 --> 19:49.340]  It was like they're trying to do a Darth Vader thing and it sounded awful.
[19:52.910 --> 19:56.950]  We need to come up with a list of things that Xbox needs to bring back.
[19:58.310 --> 20:00.530]  We got two. We want the snap feature in.
[20:00.690 --> 20:02.390]  We need voice masking back.
[20:04.170 --> 20:05.090]  Snap feature.
[20:06.290 --> 20:07.290]  Oh, so shit.
[20:08.350 --> 20:11.550]  I can't even call it the snap feature now because it's the Switch now.
[20:12.010 --> 20:14.010]  The Switch owns the word snap, I would say.
[20:15.470 --> 20:17.830]  They snap exclusively.
[20:17.830 --> 20:19.590]  Have you not watched like a Nintendo Direct?
[20:19.810 --> 20:22.710]  Like they're constantly fucking snapping their fingers between games.
[20:23.150 --> 20:23.550]  No.
[20:24.450 --> 20:25.450]  Real? Oh, my God.
[20:26.270 --> 20:27.770]  You're missing out on all the snap content.
[20:28.230 --> 20:29.750]  Yeah, I'm behind on my snap.
[20:30.810 --> 20:32.590]  He didn't make the jump to serious, I guess.
[20:33.010 --> 20:34.470]  Hernandez hits, hits.
[20:34.730 --> 20:35.910]  It would be really cool.
[20:36.490 --> 20:37.290]  Abraham Toro.
[20:37.490 --> 20:41.510]  I don't know, but it would be really cool if you went to a baseball game,
[20:41.610 --> 20:44.810]  didn't know they were taking a photo and found yourself in the background.
[20:45.310 --> 20:47.090]  Like if you just opened a pack.
[20:47.370 --> 20:50.990]  Yeah, and you just found your out of focus, sweaty, hot doggy in the face.
[20:51.350 --> 20:52.530]  Yeah. Hey, that's me.
[20:52.530 --> 20:54.790]  That guy in all blue, that's a guy.
[21:01.920 --> 21:04.900]  You know how sometimes they pitch a ball and it just obliterates
[21:04.900 --> 21:06.000]  a pigeon that's flying by?
[21:06.620 --> 21:08.360]  Yeah. I wonder if that ever made it on a card.
[21:11.120 --> 21:14.560]  Oh, yeah, one of 25 pigeon feathers.
[21:14.740 --> 21:16.960]  Oh, that's cool. Yeah, he was a padre last season.
[21:17.260 --> 21:19.100]  Didn't get a hit for a very, very long time.
[21:19.100 --> 21:21.960]  Something about that baseball helmet makes Eric look really tiny.
[21:24.260 --> 21:28.340]  It like has shifted his entire perspective, like is his profile.
[21:30.720 --> 21:34.220]  And maybe that's just me, but I feel like he's shrunken in size
[21:34.220 --> 21:35.000]  when putting on that helmet.
[21:38.180 --> 21:39.800]  Yeah, they got to wait right to the end.
[21:41.060 --> 21:42.000]  Yeah, they said that.
[21:43.500 --> 21:45.160]  But now I'm starting to believe him.
[21:46.360 --> 21:48.280]  You didn't believe it from the beginning?
[21:49.100 --> 21:49.480]  Oh, wow.
[21:52.640 --> 21:54.800]  He's in so much trouble.
[21:58.500 --> 22:02.120]  Have you used the the twisty straw or whatever?
[22:02.300 --> 22:04.880]  What is the name of those crazy straws?
[22:05.080 --> 22:06.080]  I have not used it yet.
[22:06.400 --> 22:07.700]  Didn't you say it was dog shit?
[22:08.800 --> 22:11.440]  Well, it's it's like it works as intended.
[22:13.480 --> 22:15.620]  I really want us to try to race using it.
[22:17.160 --> 22:18.500]  Yeah, a full gerbler chug.
[22:19.140 --> 22:21.280]  A full gerbler chug, I think would be really funny.
[22:22.240 --> 22:25.880]  Also, Gracie hasn't done a soda chug, and I feel like that it's a must
[22:25.880 --> 22:27.340]  if you're going to be involved with us.
[22:27.700 --> 22:29.560]  Yeah, I want to just do like Gracie's gauntlet.
[22:30.160 --> 22:30.560]  Yeah.
[22:33.200 --> 22:34.780]  Gracie's gauntlet is a great name for it.
[22:36.920 --> 22:39.660]  Oh, I'm an idiot.
[22:39.920 --> 22:41.060]  I got to rewind back.
[22:41.100 --> 22:42.720]  I never hit record on the capture.
[22:43.520 --> 22:44.340]  That was foolish.
[22:45.320 --> 22:45.600]  Yeah, it was.
[22:50.100 --> 22:51.340]  I'm doing that right now.
[22:51.340 --> 22:52.640]  Yeah, we're back to life.
[22:54.040 --> 22:55.240]  It's a great feature, that.
[22:55.880 --> 22:57.300]  Oh, I would be.
[22:57.500 --> 22:59.300]  We would have lost so many videos.
[23:00.540 --> 23:06.120]  Speaking of which, did you ever find the Halo 2 thing that we made like in August?
[23:08.980 --> 23:10.320]  Yeah, it was on an iPad.
[23:11.300 --> 23:12.520]  Oh, that's awesome.
[23:13.080 --> 23:16.700]  I was going to export it the other day, and then my subscription
[23:16.700 --> 23:19.560]  to Final Cut on iPad has expired, so I need to renew it.
[23:19.560 --> 23:19.980]  No!
[23:21.680 --> 23:25.500]  So you have to get a new subscription to get that video off of it?
[23:25.500 --> 23:28.560]  I basically have to pay to export a video I edited a month ago.
[23:29.120 --> 23:30.280]  Oh, my God.
[23:30.920 --> 23:31.940]  How much is it?
[23:32.980 --> 23:34.560]  Uh, I think it's like
[23:35.960 --> 23:37.180]  15 bucks a month or something.
[23:37.800 --> 23:38.540]  OK, that's not bad.
[23:38.920 --> 23:39.360]  Not too bad.
[23:40.060 --> 23:42.180]  Is Final Cut, do they do...
[23:42.180 --> 23:42.820]  It was a free trial.
[23:43.160 --> 23:43.820]  You can buy it out?
[23:45.480 --> 23:46.260]  I don't know.
[23:46.460 --> 23:48.520]  Because the last time I got a Mac,
[23:48.520 --> 23:50.380]  I had it installed on it.
[23:50.480 --> 23:53.020]  I had to pay like an additional 400 or whatever to have it in.
[23:53.420 --> 23:55.680]  Yeah, on the Mac, it's like a $300 one off.
[23:58.620 --> 23:59.680]  Oh, I see.
[23:59.940 --> 24:03.360]  But since the iPad is like a situation, yeah, it's a newer product.
[24:03.420 --> 24:06.220]  And nobody wants you to own anything anymore.
[24:06.300 --> 24:08.580]  They want you to rent it.
[24:08.820 --> 24:15.540]  I don't mind it for games only because you need online connectivity for games.
[24:16.300 --> 24:18.460]  Like the idea that like owning your games
[24:18.460 --> 24:22.100]  physically preserves them in some way just doesn't work anymore.
[24:23.080 --> 24:23.160]  Right.
[24:23.280 --> 24:26.640]  Like it did on like the Super Nintendo or whatever GameCube.
[24:27.840 --> 24:29.360]  But everything else that sucks with.
[24:29.880 --> 24:30.660]  I love Game Pass.
[24:31.640 --> 24:33.920]  Isn't it crazy that they used to ship cartridges
[24:34.580 --> 24:37.220]  which were very expensive to make, and then that was it.
[24:37.300 --> 24:38.260]  You couldn't patch it.
[24:39.200 --> 24:40.580]  You had to just nail it.
[24:41.660 --> 24:45.060]  Yeah, it's like people, whenever a game gets delayed,
[24:45.060 --> 24:49.660]  likes to, people like to post that thing of what's his name, the Mario guy.
[24:50.540 --> 24:52.440]  The quote that isn't his where it's like,
[24:53.220 --> 24:56.420]  if you if a delayed game is only delayed for a time,
[24:56.500 --> 24:57.960]  but a broken game remains broken.
[24:58.380 --> 25:00.120]  And so that doesn't, it's not how that works now.
[25:00.400 --> 25:01.500]  That's so not true.
[25:01.640 --> 25:03.880]  That that doesn't apply at all.
[25:09.200 --> 25:11.360]  Oh, we got Japanese Donald Duck.
[25:14.220 --> 25:15.340]  This is some Jack shit.
[25:15.340 --> 25:16.900]  I don't know anything. What's going on?
[25:19.640 --> 25:23.440]  Um, what was I going to talk to you about a minute ago?
[25:23.480 --> 25:26.500]  We're talking about they had an animated item, bro.
[25:32.140 --> 25:33.560]  I don't know what that is.
[25:35.920 --> 25:36.920]  Beep, beep the atom.
[25:36.920 --> 25:38.360]  These are really cool.
[25:40.240 --> 25:41.340]  It's no ratty boy.
[25:41.580 --> 25:42.600]  I'll tell you that much.
[25:43.180 --> 25:44.920]  Mickey and friends, cheerful time.
[25:44.940 --> 25:46.540]  Oh, we never got an update on Raty boy.
[25:46.800 --> 25:48.060]  These Disney cards are going to make me.
[25:48.680 --> 25:51.220]  I don't know when this will come out, so I can't.
[25:51.280 --> 25:52.680]  OK, is that for Thursday?
[25:52.820 --> 25:54.980]  But I do have one. OK, this is.
[25:56.000 --> 25:56.880]  Panchita pistols.
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.320]  I feel like that's offensive.
[25:59.480 --> 26:00.240]  Here's a Pluto.
[26:00.880 --> 26:03.480]  I feel like that's the dangerous thing about doing old Disney
[26:03.480 --> 26:05.080]  animated stuff like this is.
[26:05.460 --> 26:08.060]  I mean, I'm assuming they curated it and it's a new product.
[26:08.180 --> 26:11.300]  But if you were to just pull from what was acceptable at the time.
[26:12.200 --> 26:15.020]  Yes, you'd have to look at it with the the eyes of the time.
[26:17.340 --> 26:20.120]  That doesn't always work, though, depending on the content.
[26:21.560 --> 26:23.840]  You cannot always trust the eyes of even the time
[26:25.120 --> 26:27.240]  based on what is no longer on Disney plus.
[26:28.680 --> 26:31.040]  Yeah, it's a good measuring stick killer.
[26:33.540 --> 26:34.880]  Fuck, I was so I'm so mad.
[26:34.880 --> 26:36.540]  I was excited to talk to you about something.
[26:36.660 --> 26:38.440]  I don't remember. Was it the Beagle Boys?
[26:39.860 --> 26:41.500]  It was the Beagle Boys.
[26:42.540 --> 26:44.920]  So this is kind of like the book we did of where it's like one.
[26:47.380 --> 26:50.800]  I, I learned last night and I'm going to test it when we're done here.
[26:51.260 --> 26:55.160]  That there is a thing on EA, EA Sports games called Game Face.
[26:55.540 --> 26:59.220]  You know how like you could scan your face for Rainbow Six Vegas in the past?
[26:59.820 --> 27:02.500]  EA and I've never seen anyone talk about this
[27:02.500 --> 27:07.640]  has a thing called Game Face where you can scan a photo of your face
[27:07.640 --> 27:10.600]  and then use it as create a characters.
[27:10.880 --> 27:12.900]  And Geoff did that, didn't he, in that basketball game?
[27:13.780 --> 27:17.240]  He did, but that was like a phone app thing, I think.
[27:17.700 --> 27:20.780]  This is like you save a photo online
[27:21.300 --> 27:24.240]  and then you can import your like create a fighter UFC
[27:24.240 --> 27:26.900]  using the face that you scanned on your computer.
[27:27.280 --> 27:32.320]  So I am we we we have some things we could possibly do with that
[27:32.320 --> 27:33.580]  that I'm very excited about.
[27:42.340 --> 27:43.800]  Have you played trucks recently?
[27:44.500 --> 27:46.340]  No, I haven't done anything recently.
[27:47.080 --> 27:48.540]  I've been a just a little
[27:50.040 --> 27:53.280]  little editor, a little editing man.
[27:53.420 --> 27:55.440]  Yeah, just tiny little man editing.
[27:56.460 --> 27:59.200]  Do you still have a lot more editing work to do or have you kind of
[27:59.660 --> 28:01.360]  crossed over where you can do some editing?
[28:02.160 --> 28:05.780]  As of last night at 2 a.m., I'm not an editing man.
[28:06.180 --> 28:08.720]  God, hell yeah, man. At least for a week.
[28:10.780 --> 28:12.420]  What are you going to do with this new time?
[28:13.600 --> 28:16.040]  But I wouldn't call them absolutely nothing.
[28:16.080 --> 28:18.720]  I got clean, clean.
[28:18.980 --> 28:20.200]  Yeah, I got to do some cleaning.
[28:21.640 --> 28:24.620]  I guess so behind Fisher, if you want to.
[28:24.700 --> 28:27.500]  Oh, yeah, that's actually that'll relate to my injury.
[28:27.700 --> 28:29.940]  It's funny. It was a cleaning injury.
[28:30.980 --> 28:32.580]  Maybe I'm not going to spoil anything.
[28:32.700 --> 28:34.140]  Maybe that had a factor in it.
[28:34.260 --> 28:36.980]  See, now I'm imagining like you as a cartoon
[28:36.980 --> 28:39.660]  slipping on a mop and you end up standing on the mop.
[28:39.660 --> 28:43.420]  But this the slick of the mop ends up sliding around the room
[28:43.420 --> 28:45.760]  and you're just like riding in the mop, you know?
[28:46.460 --> 28:48.440]  Whatever they they're doing fine.
[28:49.520 --> 28:51.060]  Yeah, but we're struggling.
[28:51.300 --> 28:52.880]  We don't know. I don't think that happened.
[28:53.000 --> 28:53.560]  Here's a pack.
[28:53.680 --> 28:56.300]  We'll see. And then a bucket falls on your head and you can't see.
[28:58.320 --> 28:58.860]  You drown.
[28:59.220 --> 29:01.360]  Turns out I'm in Kevin McAllister's house.
[29:01.980 --> 29:02.940]  Yeah, of course.
[29:03.120 --> 29:05.780]  Who hasn't had a beer there?
[29:06.080 --> 29:09.380]  I would rather accidentally break into the Terminator's
[29:09.380 --> 29:11.080]  house than Kevin McAllister's house.
[29:11.980 --> 29:13.640]  I don't think the Terminator has a house.
[29:14.060 --> 29:14.940]  That's a good point.
[29:16.540 --> 29:20.080]  If there's any movie character that doesn't need a house,
[29:20.140 --> 29:20.960]  it's probably the Terminator.
[29:21.360 --> 29:23.280]  Yeah, that was a terrible example.
[29:25.600 --> 29:29.460]  Do you ever think about...
[29:29.460 --> 29:31.780]  Oh, is it the Hellraiser box?
[29:32.420 --> 29:33.660]  I think so.
[29:33.760 --> 29:36.760]  They pulled like Blizzard cards.
[29:36.900 --> 29:37.740]  I think it's a Diablo thing.
[29:37.740 --> 29:38.700]  Last week.
[29:40.240 --> 29:44.700]  If you get killed by any famous movie character, fight them.
[29:44.880 --> 29:46.020]  Maybe you kill them.
[29:46.560 --> 29:47.300]  Who do you pick?
[29:47.980 --> 29:49.360]  A movie character that I can kill?
[29:49.860 --> 29:52.260]  Yeah, the Predator.
[29:54.500 --> 29:55.100]  Sauron.
[29:56.140 --> 29:56.740]  Really?
[29:57.900 --> 30:00.760]  I'd climb up that tower and I'd poke him in the eye.
[30:04.960 --> 30:06.660]  That giant flaming eye?
[30:06.660 --> 30:07.200]  Yeah.
[30:10.480 --> 30:15.620]  Do you ever see those Ben Stein commercials
[30:15.620 --> 30:18.180]  for the eye irritant drops?
[30:19.020 --> 30:19.460]  No.
[30:20.800 --> 30:23.180]  I haven't thought about those in a long time.
[30:23.320 --> 30:25.680]  It's like him being very boring on a beach.
[30:25.840 --> 30:28.560]  But it's like, if you use these eye drops, your eyes won't hurt anymore.
[30:29.080 --> 30:31.320]  Just imagining like an eye drop ad with Sauron.
[30:31.800 --> 30:35.160]  Was that just like a giant bucket of drops?
[30:35.880 --> 30:37.900]  Was that Ben Stein's real voice?
[30:38.040 --> 30:38.960]  Or was he putting that on?
[30:39.760 --> 30:41.140]  That's a great question.
[30:41.280 --> 30:42.700]  I've never heard him not do that.
[30:43.580 --> 30:44.980]  Yeah, I assume it's his voice.
[30:46.760 --> 30:48.100]  Wasn't he also in the mask?
[30:48.840 --> 30:49.800]  Was he?
[30:51.380 --> 30:54.000]  I mainly think of him as when Ben Stein's money.
[30:54.540 --> 30:57.040]  Let me look up what Ben Stein's IMDB is up to.
[31:01.120 --> 31:03.420]  Most known for Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
[31:05.160 --> 31:08.580]  I feel like if that is it, like if he is putting on a fake voice,
[31:08.600 --> 31:10.780]  that movie defined his entire personality.
[31:18.180 --> 31:19.860]  What is this from?
[31:21.000 --> 31:23.080]  He was in Son of the Mask and The Mask.
[31:23.200 --> 31:23.740]  He's in both.
[31:23.820 --> 31:26.000]  He might be the only character in both films.
[31:26.660 --> 31:28.980]  Because he's the guy, I think he's talking to
[31:30.680 --> 31:33.400]  Stanley about how it's the mask of Loki and
[31:33.960 --> 31:35.820]  what that means and all that mischief.
[31:35.940 --> 31:37.780]  I don't remember any of that.
[31:38.080 --> 31:38.880]  But it doesn't work.
[31:39.040 --> 31:41.260]  You can't put it on in front of him.
[31:41.520 --> 31:42.820]  You can tell he's not.
[31:43.400 --> 31:45.680]  Oh, he's he has 80 acting credits.
[31:45.840 --> 31:49.280]  That's more than the things he's known for are definitely smaller roles.
[31:50.060 --> 31:51.320]  He's known for four things.
[31:51.960 --> 31:55.680]  Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Mask, Son of the Mask and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.
[31:56.600 --> 31:59.840]  And his roles in two of those are economics teacher
[31:59.840 --> 32:02.680]  and Wichita airport representative.
[32:03.400 --> 32:04.340]  Like very clearly
[32:06.300 --> 32:08.060]  characters that don't even have names.
[32:09.980 --> 32:11.520]  He was in Married with Children.
[32:12.020 --> 32:12.860]  That's pretty cool.
[32:13.100 --> 32:13.820]  Where did this come from?
[32:14.100 --> 32:16.840]  I'm going to because I know my phone near me.
[32:17.180 --> 32:19.440]  I'm going to slack you right now.
[32:19.980 --> 32:23.720]  One of the top photo for Ben Stein when you go on his IMDb page.
[32:25.340 --> 32:29.280]  OK, I would argue that it's it's the best photo I've seen.
[32:29.380 --> 32:31.900]  I don't know if maybe it changes every time you load his page.
[32:32.000 --> 32:32.880]  I hope not.
[32:32.880 --> 32:36.300]  I hope that everyone that looks at Ben Stein's IMDb is greeted
[32:36.300 --> 32:37.880]  with this beautiful.
[32:38.300 --> 32:42.020]  That's that's not what I meant to send at all.
[32:42.280 --> 32:45.100]  Delete message before you look at it.
[32:45.420 --> 32:48.140]  Oh, this. Oh, I got a sneak peek of something.
[32:49.020 --> 32:50.040]  A little sneak.
[32:51.000 --> 32:53.120]  You're having some sloppy pastes recently.
[32:53.340 --> 32:55.280]  I'm having some sloppy pastes.
[32:55.320 --> 32:55.660]  You're right.
[32:56.040 --> 32:56.580]  There we go.
[32:56.740 --> 32:57.700]  OK, look at that.
[32:57.860 --> 32:59.420]  Look at that beauty.
[32:59.540 --> 33:00.660]  What's going on there?
[33:00.820 --> 33:01.940]  Ben Stein in a chicken suit.
[33:02.880 --> 33:05.800]  Is he like the guardian of dog heaven?
[33:06.940 --> 33:08.160]  I think so.
[33:08.340 --> 33:10.720]  I it's I have no idea.
[33:10.740 --> 33:11.460]  Yeah, definitely.
[33:11.580 --> 33:13.800]  He's like the puppy heaven administrator.
[33:18.320 --> 33:20.740]  Episode Requiem for a Dead Briar.
[33:21.460 --> 33:26.600]  Oh, this is this episode just keeps on giving when you go to the.
[33:28.500 --> 33:31.980]  This is the image, Gavin, when you open the specific episode.
[33:31.980 --> 33:33.200]  On IMDb.
[33:33.520 --> 33:37.060]  Just a close up of his face with the chicken mask on.
[33:37.580 --> 33:37.980]  Wow.
[33:38.380 --> 33:39.060]  You know what?
[33:39.200 --> 33:40.540]  I think we will open some. Wow. Beautiful.
[33:40.820 --> 33:42.180]  Is he alive to the nuggets?
[33:42.300 --> 33:43.440]  I'm just excited for it.
[33:43.440 --> 33:44.700]  I got a special one for you guys.
[33:44.860 --> 33:45.940]  What? You guys are going to love this.
[33:46.000 --> 33:47.100]  Get to the nuggets.
[33:47.380 --> 33:48.160]  Listen to Eric.
[33:48.460 --> 33:49.000]  Get to them.
[33:49.220 --> 33:50.960]  They have 15 nuggets to open.
[33:51.100 --> 33:54.460]  Geoff, you're more than halfway through this fucking stream.
[33:55.540 --> 33:58.440]  I missed all the cheerleaders looking at pictures of Ben Stein as a chicken.
[33:59.160 --> 34:01.440]  Yeah, but you got to come back in for trolls.
[34:01.440 --> 34:02.340]  That's true.
[34:02.960 --> 34:03.480]  Jocko.
[34:04.000 --> 34:05.080]  Jocko fucks.
[34:06.580 --> 34:07.620]  Freddy Fibbler.
[34:08.040 --> 34:08.380]  Oh, Fibber.
[34:08.800 --> 34:09.320]  Freddy.
[34:09.520 --> 34:13.580]  Freddy Fibber looks and feels like a character you would come up with, Gavin.
[34:13.880 --> 34:15.820]  That'd be like a Stewart for you.
[34:16.140 --> 34:19.340]  Like if Stewart was personified, it's Freddy Fibber.
[34:22.920 --> 34:26.620]  Why is he holding it behind the picture of Emily and Eric?
[34:27.200 --> 34:29.040]  Because Geoff sucks at this.
[34:36.480 --> 34:40.710]  I mean, in fairness, this is a PTZ cam, so they could just pan it.
[34:42.040 --> 34:44.400]  Oh, you're going to get me in Jack trouble again.
[34:45.220 --> 34:46.940]  My my filming ignorance.
[34:48.080 --> 34:50.300]  Not knowing that there's an alternate solution.
[34:53.780 --> 34:55.700]  I actually kind of love these cards.
[34:56.240 --> 34:58.260]  These are so shitty and like the best way.
[34:58.260 --> 35:01.140]  His favorite pastime is chasing bunnies off the bunny slope.
[35:01.340 --> 35:02.660]  Oh, do ski bunnies.
[35:02.680 --> 35:03.140]  Why am I?
[35:03.380 --> 35:05.120]  Is a championship snow skier.
[35:05.200 --> 35:06.520]  He gives lessons at...
[35:06.520 --> 35:07.040]  Why are you what?
[35:07.740 --> 35:09.380]  Why am I watching on my own feed?
[35:10.000 --> 35:11.340]  I don't know. I'm watching.
[35:11.820 --> 35:13.360]  I'm watching on the shared feed.
[35:13.400 --> 35:15.080]  Yeah, I just had it next. It was had two up.
[35:15.320 --> 35:19.200]  He likes to race down the ski slopes at full speed while the other trolls cheer him on.
[35:19.360 --> 35:20.540]  I keep doing the same thing.
[35:20.760 --> 35:23.400]  I'm going to be honest when I'm trying to remember to look at the main screen.
[35:23.800 --> 35:25.280]  A couple of years ago, he's a proud of it.
[35:25.320 --> 35:26.220]  That's really good.
[35:26.940 --> 35:27.420]  Wait,
[35:28.960 --> 35:31.500]  Buck, do you know who Buck the dog is?
[35:31.760 --> 35:34.560]  Is that a famous dog or is that just in Finland?
[35:34.820 --> 35:37.520]  Because the plot of the episode is Buck, the dog dies in heaven.
[35:37.620 --> 35:40.220]  He is sent back to Earth as the Bundy's new dog, Lucky.
[35:41.240 --> 35:42.100]  Ted Bundy?
[35:44.300 --> 35:49.560]  No, I don't think Ted Bundy was part of the Bundy family.
[35:49.800 --> 35:52.980]  Shockingly, Married with Children would be a very different show
[35:52.980 --> 35:54.660]  if Ted Bundy was one of the kids.
[35:54.900 --> 35:55.820]  Theodore Bundy.
[35:55.820 --> 35:57.660]  They open up the pink box sometimes.
[35:58.280 --> 36:01.660]  Yeah, Bud Bundy, Al Bundy, Peggy Bundy, Kelly Bundy.
[36:01.680 --> 36:02.300]  I'm sorry about that one.
[36:02.740 --> 36:03.800]  No, Ted.
[36:04.020 --> 36:06.220]  Cops 2012 baseball.
[36:06.480 --> 36:07.160]  Holy shit.
[36:07.620 --> 36:08.860]  2012? 2012.
[36:09.500 --> 36:11.040]  Nobody cares about 2012.
[36:12.740 --> 36:14.400]  Get to the nugget, buddies.
[36:15.880 --> 36:18.020]  What if he doesn't get to it this episode?
[36:19.020 --> 36:19.920]  I will.
[36:21.200 --> 36:22.080]  Uh, let's see.
[36:22.200 --> 36:25.020]  I hate that you suggested that because that feels very possible.
[36:25.020 --> 36:28.720]  That is that would be the absolute Geoff thing to do.
[36:28.780 --> 36:30.820]  Yeah, if he pulled a Geoff.
[36:32.340 --> 36:33.020]  Yeah, wow.
[36:33.600 --> 36:34.620]  Oh, my God.
[36:34.880 --> 36:38.180]  Yeah, if he like Matt Damon's me and is like, well, I ran out of time.
[36:38.340 --> 36:39.240]  We'll do it next time.
[36:40.260 --> 36:44.500]  And yet the worst part is, is that like he would have constructed this the entire time.
[36:44.580 --> 36:47.420]  I can see fucking Geoff being like, oh, I'm going to.
[36:47.500 --> 36:50.900]  We'll do a bit where we pretend that we forget and then we throw it away
[36:50.900 --> 36:52.360]  because he knows I'm recording this.
[36:52.700 --> 36:54.240]  Well, why don't we just if that happens?
[36:54.240 --> 36:56.340]  Well, we'll just pretend we forgot.
[36:57.060 --> 36:58.220]  That's a great idea.
[36:59.400 --> 37:02.560]  I did ask Nick about it, and I think Nick is in the room right now.
[37:03.760 --> 37:04.700]  Oh, in that room.
[37:05.720 --> 37:09.800]  Yeah, I think that's why he's not here with us is that he had to go into the office,
[37:09.920 --> 37:11.240]  I think, to be part of this.
[37:11.660 --> 37:15.420]  I mean, if maybe if he doesn't get around to it, I could just go there and force him.
[37:15.640 --> 37:17.640]  OK, so should I put it in this big guy?
[37:17.720 --> 37:19.760]  I would. I'll slack Nick right now.
[37:20.300 --> 37:22.200]  So it's maybe pretty decent.
[37:23.900 --> 37:26.600]  Are you in the room?
[37:26.840 --> 37:29.940]  Because Eric probably isn't going to check his phone.
[37:40.160 --> 37:43.000]  I just realized I messaged Nick, are you in the room?
[37:43.060 --> 37:44.060]  But in no other context.
[37:48.880 --> 37:50.200]  I'm going to guess the answer is yes.
[37:51.020 --> 37:52.840]  He's definitely in a room.
[37:53.340 --> 37:54.820]  What are these creatures?
[37:55.940 --> 37:57.060]  What's with the papyrus?
[37:57.420 --> 37:57.640]  What's a plith?
[37:57.720 --> 37:58.400]  It's like Digimon.
[37:58.860 --> 38:01.760]  Oh, it's year 2000.
[38:02.660 --> 38:04.660]  Uh, Fire Chogo.
[38:04.940 --> 38:05.360]  Careful.
[38:05.860 --> 38:07.840]  Oh, these are like dollar store Pokemon.
[38:10.400 --> 38:11.460]  Fire Chogo.
[38:12.260 --> 38:14.200]  Oh, smite two.
[38:14.700 --> 38:16.340]  They made a second smite.
[38:17.160 --> 38:17.780]  Yeah, they did.
[38:17.920 --> 38:18.560]  We're going to play it.
[38:18.680 --> 38:19.380]  That's real game footage.
[38:20.220 --> 38:21.980]  Skip all my controllers off.
[38:22.260 --> 38:22.360]  Fuck.
[38:22.680 --> 38:22.760]  Oh, no.
[38:22.980 --> 38:24.140]  We're watching too much of the ad.
[38:26.600 --> 38:27.480]  Edit that.
[38:29.400 --> 38:31.040]  Sponsored by Smite 2.
[38:32.840 --> 38:34.100]  We'll take Smite 2 money.
[38:36.160 --> 38:37.920]  I actually liked the first smite.
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.100]  It just was beyond me.
[38:39.400 --> 38:41.460]  I felt like I got in too late to smite.
[38:42.640 --> 38:43.420]  I didn't.
[38:43.500 --> 38:44.700]  I don't enjoy any of those games.
[38:46.340 --> 38:47.800]  They're just not my bag, you know?
[38:48.060 --> 38:49.360]  You're not a MOBA guy?
[38:49.360 --> 38:50.000]  Not really.
[38:51.040 --> 38:52.140]  I tried and I sucked.
[38:55.180 --> 38:58.960]  Have you ever switched on a genre like you spent most of your life hating it
[38:58.960 --> 39:02.140]  and something something happened and now you like it?
[39:02.440 --> 39:03.420]  Oh, RPGs.
[39:04.340 --> 39:05.120]  Oh, really?
[39:05.680 --> 39:07.980]  Well, not like true RPGs, but like Bethesda.
[39:11.060 --> 39:11.940]  Like Morrowind?
[39:12.620 --> 39:15.820]  Yeah, like I hated looking at Morrowind.
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.900]  I felt like Oblivion was an absolute chore
[39:18.900 --> 39:19.540]  to get through.
[39:20.020 --> 39:21.000]  I hated it.
[39:21.740 --> 39:25.140]  And then something just switched and I really enjoyed Fallout 3.
[39:25.740 --> 39:26.440]  Loved Skyrim.
[39:26.880 --> 39:27.720]  Loved New Vegas.
[39:29.480 --> 39:31.900]  I could probably go back and enjoy Oblivion if I wanted.
[39:34.040 --> 39:35.240]  That's an interesting genre
[39:36.460 --> 39:37.560]  to switch on.
[39:38.220 --> 39:41.720]  I feel like I like turn based games, but I don't think I do.
[39:42.280 --> 39:45.260]  I always go through the exercise of going in, kind of dreading it,
[39:45.300 --> 39:46.940]  and then I eventually get the hang of it.
[39:50.160 --> 39:53.260]  I'm trying to think of the last turn based game I played.
[39:54.340 --> 39:57.020]  There's a new Yakuza game coming out that's turn based,
[39:57.140 --> 40:00.220]  and that'll probably be the most recent one I'll play.
[40:00.680 --> 40:02.240]  Maybe Mario and Rabbids.
[40:03.720 --> 40:06.100]  You know what? I didn't mind you saying Mario.
[40:06.340 --> 40:07.220]  That's interesting.
[40:08.080 --> 40:10.500]  Something about your accent gets away with Mario.
[40:14.880 --> 40:16.720]  Like the traditional...
[40:16.720 --> 40:18.160]  Yeah, that's that works.
[40:18.160 --> 40:19.480]  That's crazy.
[40:20.640 --> 40:21.760]  Wait, who is this?
[40:22.780 --> 40:23.660]  Robert Woolf?
[40:26.720 --> 40:28.840]  I'm going to look up Robert Woolf.
[40:32.300 --> 40:34.080]  You have any idea who this actor is?
[40:40.200 --> 40:41.580]  I have no idea.
[40:43.700 --> 40:45.320]  Get to... Oh, my God, Geoff.
[40:45.320 --> 40:46.100]  It's Arliss.
[40:46.380 --> 40:48.360]  OK, cool, thanks. Thanks for the explanation.
[40:49.720 --> 40:52.420]  We're getting to a point where he'll have less than one minute
[40:52.420 --> 40:53.840]  to deal with every nugget, buddy.
[40:54.740 --> 40:56.480]  Oh, here we go. It's Pedro Martinez.
[40:57.500 --> 40:59.360]  Oh, he's going to breeze through him if he gets to him, I think.
[40:59.700 --> 41:01.200]  Do you think Arliss is the name of that dog?
[41:03.800 --> 41:04.520]  Did you...
[41:04.960 --> 41:07.100]  Did you learn the name of their dog recently?
[41:07.280 --> 41:08.740]  Was there some something that...
[41:08.740 --> 41:10.600]  OK, I wasn't sure because you guys went over there.
[41:11.080 --> 41:12.320]  Gracie knows it, though.
[41:13.880 --> 41:15.260]  Which is bullshit.
[41:16.200 --> 41:18.360]  I wonder... I can't...
[41:19.500 --> 41:22.000]  Something will come out in the future that will change
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.120]  the audience's perception of Gracie.
[41:24.320 --> 41:28.560]  And I wonder if Geoff learning that has changed his
[41:28.560 --> 41:31.240]  his confidence in letting her know that secret.
[41:31.600 --> 41:32.760]  Do I know this thing?
[41:33.440 --> 41:33.960]  Yes, you do.
[41:34.320 --> 41:36.800]  It was... It blew us all away.
[41:36.960 --> 41:38.700]  Oh, yeah. It was shocking.
[41:38.900 --> 41:41.060]  It was a shocking confession by Gracie.
[41:46.470 --> 41:47.970]  When are we continuing that?
[41:49.750 --> 41:52.970]  Did you see the slack about it?
[41:53.930 --> 41:54.910]  I asked.
[41:55.630 --> 41:56.810]  I asked that question.
[41:56.930 --> 41:57.910]  Are you around Wednesday?
[41:59.350 --> 41:59.470]  Yeah.
[42:00.050 --> 42:01.550]  OK, let's do Wednesday then.
[42:01.630 --> 42:02.350]  We'll film the next round.
[42:03.810 --> 42:05.710]  If Gavin is free Wednesday.
[42:07.990 --> 42:09.050]  Free every day.
[42:11.710 --> 42:14.450]  You have been amazing with their availability.
[42:14.730 --> 42:15.530]  And it's very appreciated.
[42:15.530 --> 42:16.750]  I don't know when you go.
[42:16.890 --> 42:18.270]  I know you have something coming up at some point.
[42:18.810 --> 42:20.770]  Yeah, pretty much outside of travel.
[42:21.250 --> 42:23.090]  Pretty soon we'll be popping into those.
[42:23.310 --> 42:26.350]  You've been the most consistent person showing up to our Let's Play slot,
[42:26.470 --> 42:28.470]  which has been a lot of fun and very appreciated.
[42:28.610 --> 42:31.190]  I like that we we built in a Let's Play slot.
[42:31.390 --> 42:35.650]  And I think Geoff's been gone for almost every single one except for one.
[42:36.810 --> 42:39.750]  And then you you suggested maybe we change it.
[42:39.790 --> 42:42.390]  And everyone said, this is the best day for me.
[42:43.190 --> 42:44.190]  Yeah, I was like,
[42:44.190 --> 42:47.790]  it's our standing slot in the wrong on the wrong day.
[42:48.150 --> 42:49.030]  And I was like, no, it's great.
[42:53.290 --> 42:54.570]  He's going to be out on Thursday.
[42:54.710 --> 42:58.050]  I don't know if you have plans on Thursday, but Geoff will not be there.
[42:58.670 --> 43:02.490]  Oh, does that mean he's missing the recording to the episode?
[43:02.790 --> 43:05.590]  Oh, no, but it's green.
[43:05.790 --> 43:07.630]  No, I think he'll be done by then.
[43:07.650 --> 43:07.870]  All right.
[43:09.910 --> 43:10.550]  I assume.
[43:10.690 --> 43:12.590]  All right. Now, surely time for nugs.
[43:13.330 --> 43:14.670]  Has to be time for nugs.
[43:14.670 --> 43:15.390]  Just 18 minutes.
[43:15.650 --> 43:16.870]  Nope. Oh, my God.
[43:22.070 --> 43:24.290]  If Geoff. Aids.
[43:31.110 --> 43:33.410]  If you just choose the second half,
[43:34.290 --> 43:35.950]  that would have made less sense.
[43:37.070 --> 43:39.850]  Why would anyone just tune into the second half of this?
[43:40.070 --> 43:40.470]  I don't know.
[43:41.030 --> 43:42.570]  This isn't a radio program.
[43:42.750 --> 43:44.450]  There's no. It's true.
[43:44.670 --> 43:48.130]  There's no just like, but you never know how people watch the VODs.
[43:48.630 --> 43:49.250]  That's fair.
[43:52.470 --> 43:53.910]  Um, fuck, what was I?
[43:54.390 --> 43:56.530]  Was you threw me so hard with your aids?
[43:56.630 --> 43:59.830]  Yell. Oh, man.
[43:59.990 --> 44:01.250]  OK, this is what I was going to say.
[44:01.290 --> 44:04.670]  If Geoff doesn't get to the nugget buddies in this thing,
[44:05.250 --> 44:09.410]  we're coming back and I'm constructing an anti Geoff episode.
[44:10.370 --> 44:11.650]  This is we're Bill.
[44:11.770 --> 44:14.050]  I'm building a YouTube playlist for you and I to go through.
[44:14.510 --> 44:15.610]  I'm getting my revenge.
[44:15.870 --> 44:19.750]  Do you think if you wanted to, we could keep Geoff
[44:21.430 --> 44:23.350]  on a discord call for an hour?
[44:25.130 --> 44:27.070]  Basically, this like, hey, let's record a thing.
[44:27.190 --> 44:28.010]  And then you get here.
[44:28.630 --> 44:30.630]  Everyone's in. And then you're like, oh, hold on.
[44:30.650 --> 44:31.170]  I just need to.
[44:31.670 --> 44:32.550]  My thing needs an update.
[44:32.810 --> 44:35.590]  And then you just keep lying and lying and lying until he's been here for an hour.
[44:36.370 --> 44:43.110]  Excited to be here, as they say.
[44:43.850 --> 44:45.990]  I just saw that Gracie slacked me.
[44:47.030 --> 44:52.030]  Gracie slacked me the description of what this upload will be,
[44:52.130 --> 44:54.510]  making sure I'm OK with it for the nugget buddies.
[44:55.210 --> 44:58.450]  That's almost more insulting on the team so far.
[44:58.550 --> 45:00.050]  Wait, so she what did she ask you?
[45:00.530 --> 45:05.690]  She slacked me what the episode description will be for this upload of this
[45:05.690 --> 45:08.850]  break show and it be centered around the nugget buddies,
[45:10.690 --> 45:12.010]  making sure I'm good with it.
[45:14.470 --> 45:18.470]  16 minutes for 15 nugget buddies.
[45:18.950 --> 45:22.270]  He's going to do it with, I think, two minutes 30 to go.
[45:22.890 --> 45:26.230]  He plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers now, and it's not working out,
[45:26.310 --> 45:27.170]  even though he's very good.
[45:27.750 --> 45:30.510]  The him and him and Darius Garland, they're just not playing well together.
[45:30.790 --> 45:32.690]  And Darius is a couple of years younger and cheaper.
[45:32.810 --> 45:34.750]  And so I think that they're going to move Donovan Mitchell
[45:36.330 --> 45:37.710]  Why did I do this, Kevin?
[45:38.390 --> 45:39.710]  OK, now let me rephrase that.
[45:39.990 --> 45:42.110]  Why did I tell Geoff I was going to do this?
[45:42.290 --> 45:43.630]  Yeah, that was your first mistake.
[45:44.050 --> 45:45.070]  That was the problem.
[45:46.450 --> 45:50.130]  That was an absolute catastrophic failure on your part.
[45:51.230 --> 45:54.150]  What is do you have any of those that come to mind immediately of like
[45:54.150 --> 45:57.270]  you told Geoff a thing and immediately went, oh, that was a mistake.
[45:58.310 --> 45:59.650]  That was not.
[46:00.950 --> 46:01.350]  Hmm.
[46:03.970 --> 46:08.770]  I'm surprised that he has not used the sound effect button more
[46:08.770 --> 46:11.130]  since we showed him that is the thing.
[46:11.530 --> 46:13.370]  I thought I would assume he's already forgotten.
[46:13.490 --> 46:14.310]  AJ Perzynski.
[46:15.110 --> 46:16.370]  Well, you're not getting punched.
[46:17.450 --> 46:19.190]  Is that the Nobel hat?
[46:19.410 --> 46:20.930]  No, it's just the the backwards one.
[46:21.330 --> 46:22.010]  AJ Perzynski.
[46:22.170 --> 46:24.210]  Andrew messaged me at four thirty six.
[46:24.290 --> 46:25.250]  Get to the nugget, buddy.
[46:26.590 --> 46:27.930]  That, Andrew.
[46:29.290 --> 46:32.510]  That's not how this show works.
[46:32.510 --> 46:34.770]  Oh, Eric's in his cocky face.
[46:35.570 --> 46:37.010]  Yeah, he's doing his cocky face.
[46:37.090 --> 46:38.210]  Eric's feels powerful.
[46:38.330 --> 46:39.210]  He's in the sea of power.
[46:50.860 --> 46:52.260]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[46:52.360 --> 46:52.820]  The crew top.
[46:53.820 --> 46:54.920]  Oh, the buddies.
[46:55.160 --> 46:56.820]  What a fucking day we had on Friday.
[46:56.920 --> 46:59.180]  We can't fucking spoil anything on Friday.
[46:59.320 --> 47:00.680]  But we did. We filmed four.
[47:00.700 --> 47:01.160]  This is it.
[47:01.540 --> 47:03.040]  I've been waiting 46.
[47:03.320 --> 47:05.020]  Gavin, I've been waiting weeks for this.
[47:06.360 --> 47:07.080]  Literal weeks.
[47:07.860 --> 47:09.540]  It was wild.
[47:10.540 --> 47:11.340]  It's so good.
[47:11.500 --> 47:11.920]  We made sandwiches.
[47:11.920 --> 47:12.440]  Here it is.
[47:12.560 --> 47:12.800]  Yep.
[47:13.420 --> 47:16.780]  After they've done talking about Friday, the melon, we made pies.
[47:16.940 --> 47:17.480]  We made pies.
[47:17.780 --> 47:18.400]  Yeah, we made pies.
[47:18.800 --> 47:19.920]  All right. Are we ready to get into this?
[47:20.200 --> 47:20.560]  Yes.
[47:21.180 --> 47:24.380]  Why would you put it all there when you that's where the camera goes?
[47:25.200 --> 47:26.060]  Just to show off.
[47:26.140 --> 47:26.480]  I mean, either.
[47:27.080 --> 47:28.420]  OK, so I need Darla.
[47:28.500 --> 47:30.320]  I need Kerwin between us.
[47:30.380 --> 47:31.340]  Yeah. And you collect them all.
[47:31.380 --> 47:32.380]  We're looking for
[47:32.840 --> 47:35.400]  that. Now, Andrew already has Wafu, too.
[47:35.660 --> 47:36.500]  He has Rick.
[47:37.040 --> 47:38.160]  He has Gavin.
[47:38.300 --> 47:39.240]  I don't like the look of that.
[47:39.600 --> 47:41.160]  And he has how it's open.
[47:41.400 --> 47:42.460]  That's open for Darla.
[47:42.520 --> 47:45.320]  Yeah, I think I actually maybe it's possible.
[47:45.460 --> 47:46.780]  I accidentally sent one that was open.
[47:47.220 --> 47:50.060]  Yeah. So we're just going to try to build a pool.
[47:50.120 --> 47:51.380]  So you sent all these.
[47:51.500 --> 47:53.200]  I sent all of them.
[47:53.680 --> 47:57.850]  Or what do you want to do?
[47:57.990 --> 47:58.530]  What do you mean?
[47:58.890 --> 48:00.450]  Oh, first of all, we have.
[48:01.150 --> 48:01.870]  What do you mean?
[48:01.930 --> 48:02.790]  Am I watching?
[48:04.190 --> 48:05.530]  Was Eric not there?
[48:05.610 --> 48:07.270]  Did he leave before this is a stab?
[48:07.330 --> 48:08.130]  He was there, right?
[48:08.630 --> 48:09.350]  I don't remember.
[48:09.930 --> 48:11.070]  I don't remember either.
[48:11.230 --> 48:12.530]  Now I'm beginning to think he doesn't know.
[48:13.510 --> 48:14.670]  OK, so that's Uptown Mo.
[48:14.870 --> 48:15.490]  You've already got that.
[48:16.110 --> 48:16.970]  I got that one.
[48:16.990 --> 48:18.370]  That was the first one I got.
[48:19.250 --> 48:20.690]  They actually sell an Uptown Mo backpack.
[48:20.950 --> 48:21.270]  Yeah, go ahead.
[48:21.430 --> 48:22.190]  Honest question. Why?
[48:22.310 --> 48:23.010]  Why do you want these?
[48:24.530 --> 48:25.610]  Because they're great.
[48:26.170 --> 48:27.070]  What do you mean?
[48:28.270 --> 48:30.230]  Did you not see any when you went to Geoff's house?
[48:30.310 --> 48:31.430]  Did you not get your hands on one?
[48:32.070 --> 48:32.930]  I saw them.
[48:33.890 --> 48:36.210]  No, you got to get close for arms.
[48:37.430 --> 48:38.570]  Yeah, he's Uptown Mo.
[48:38.770 --> 48:40.750]  OK, so what? That's 15.
[48:41.190 --> 48:41.890]  I have that one.
[48:42.370 --> 48:43.670]  I mean, the Kerwin Frost.
[48:44.330 --> 48:46.150]  I don't think he does.
[48:47.750 --> 48:49.150]  Well, show that fuck.
[48:49.230 --> 48:50.210]  I want to see the seals.
[48:50.450 --> 48:51.290]  I don't trust this.
[48:51.970 --> 48:53.230]  Oh, they're avoiding the shot.
[48:53.970 --> 48:55.690]  They say that possession is everything.
[48:55.870 --> 48:57.190]  All right, next pack. Here we go.
[48:58.450 --> 49:00.210]  Come on, Kerwin, Kerwin, Kerwin.
[49:01.430 --> 49:02.790]  Or Darla, either or.
[49:03.970 --> 49:05.690]  Is it wrapped in like hamburger?
[49:05.910 --> 49:06.150]  Yeah.
[49:08.470 --> 49:09.670]  No, that's not.
[49:09.890 --> 49:10.810]  That's not either of them.
[49:12.170 --> 49:13.530]  I don't I have that one.
[49:13.730 --> 49:16.490]  I don't think that one is terrible.
[49:17.510 --> 49:18.690]  He's really bad at it.
[49:18.830 --> 49:19.830]  Why do I say that's for?
[49:20.670 --> 49:23.370]  You can adjust the tops like you can move them around.
[49:23.450 --> 49:24.830]  You can switch, which is what?
[49:24.910 --> 49:27.290]  Like the bottoms and the tops are interchangeable.
[49:27.910 --> 49:31.210]  I bet people are shoving these up their ass left and right.
[49:32.130 --> 49:33.530]  Yeah, that's your immediate thought.
[49:33.730 --> 49:36.310]  I bet people are taking the hair off and just shoving them right up.
[49:36.870 --> 49:38.290]  Having some gold nugget action.
[49:38.690 --> 49:40.070]  Yeah, I think he's missing gold.
[49:40.170 --> 49:40.850]  And I think that's it.
[49:40.850 --> 49:42.250]  Oh, yeah, I hope we get gold today.
[49:42.970 --> 49:44.250]  Why? So Andrew can have it?
[49:44.310 --> 49:45.170]  No, so we can't have it.
[49:47.930 --> 49:48.530]  It's true.
[49:48.750 --> 49:49.230]  You don't want gold?
[49:49.730 --> 49:50.590]  No, I have gold.
[49:50.670 --> 49:51.450]  I got the rarest one.
[49:51.510 --> 49:53.930]  That's what makes this so annoying, as I have the rare one.
[49:55.350 --> 49:57.790]  I don't like that they're not showing the seals in that shot.
[49:58.210 --> 49:59.350]  I don't I don't know.
[50:00.190 --> 50:00.850]  Who is this?
[50:01.550 --> 50:02.130]  It's pink.
[50:02.810 --> 50:03.290]  Oh, my God.
[50:03.290 --> 50:03.930]  Just open it.
[50:04.210 --> 50:05.290]  Oh, that's Kerwin!
[50:05.670 --> 50:06.630]  Gavin, that's Kerwin Frost!
[50:06.970 --> 50:07.370]  Hey!
[50:08.350 --> 50:09.350]  He's got the pencil!
[50:10.190 --> 50:11.570]  And he's got the fry shoes.
[50:12.010 --> 50:12.910]  Holy shit.
[50:13.970 --> 50:14.850]  Oh, my God.
[50:15.430 --> 50:16.330]  Thanks, man.
[50:20.550 --> 50:23.110]  I'm laying out that I'm doing my.
[50:25.610 --> 50:27.150]  Oh, holy shit.
[50:27.430 --> 50:29.470]  Oh, my God.
[50:29.610 --> 50:30.090]  So what?
[50:30.110 --> 50:31.870]  I got like 12 more shots at Darla.
[50:32.450 --> 50:34.430]  Dude, I feel really good about this.
[50:35.650 --> 50:37.290]  Why is there a pencil in his face?
[50:38.130 --> 50:40.210]  I think the real guy has that tattoo.
[50:40.410 --> 50:41.730]  So you'd have to ask Mr.
[50:41.910 --> 50:42.530]  Kerwin Frost.
[50:43.430 --> 50:44.930]  Yeah, Kerwin Frost is like a DJ.
[50:46.950 --> 50:48.150]  I don't care about that one.
[50:48.270 --> 50:48.970]  Whatever. That's fine.
[50:49.210 --> 50:50.190]  I got 10 more or whatever.
[50:50.930 --> 50:52.110]  Was that the fourth they pulled?
[50:56.130 --> 50:58.450]  Does my soundboard go on my audio track?
[50:59.110 --> 50:59.790]  I don't know.
[51:00.470 --> 51:02.510]  It's definitely going on the Craig track.
[51:05.870 --> 51:08.510]  Come on, Darla, Darla, Darla.
[51:08.930 --> 51:09.630]  And we got.
[51:10.110 --> 51:11.510]  I don't like I don't.
[51:11.650 --> 51:13.750]  Why does he open it so off?
[51:14.010 --> 51:15.370]  He's so bad at this.
[51:16.590 --> 51:17.890]  God damn it.
[51:18.010 --> 51:18.750]  Uptown again.
[51:19.350 --> 51:21.550]  That's my fourth Uptown Moe.
[51:22.170 --> 51:25.750]  What does Darla look like?
[51:27.050 --> 51:29.390]  Darla, look, she's got some yellow
[51:29.390 --> 51:30.210]  earmuffs on.
[51:30.430 --> 51:31.330]  Yellow muffs.
[51:31.650 --> 51:33.450]  Yeah. Well, yeah.
[51:33.550 --> 51:39.900]  OK, come on.
[51:40.780 --> 51:43.680]  Hopefully it's Darla, because that's who we need.
[51:43.860 --> 51:45.320]  OK, but what if one of them?
[51:45.760 --> 51:48.220]  No, number five.
[51:49.140 --> 51:54.180]  Andrew, how many of these are there for?
[51:54.620 --> 51:55.980]  He's asking if you're mad.
[51:56.820 --> 51:57.800]  Of course, I'm mad.
[51:58.200 --> 51:59.800]  Of course, I'm mad.
[52:05.220 --> 52:07.500]  I've been waiting an hour to be disappointed by this,
[52:07.560 --> 52:08.820]  but I'm happy with Kerwin.
[52:09.360 --> 52:10.240]  Oh, my God.
[52:10.560 --> 52:11.020]  Jesus Christ.
[52:11.020 --> 52:12.000]  How many of those do you need?
[52:12.560 --> 52:14.220]  I don't need any of those.
[52:14.360 --> 52:15.100]  That's the third one.
[52:15.260 --> 52:15.680]  I'm getting worried.
[52:15.840 --> 52:16.960]  What was that? Was that six?
[52:17.800 --> 52:19.360]  Yeah, yeah, we're kind of we're getting them.
[52:19.560 --> 52:23.120]  Yeah, don't let it be secret.
[52:24.040 --> 52:26.120]  Maybe I changed the drum beat to snare you.
[52:26.280 --> 52:26.580]  I don't know.
[52:27.100 --> 52:29.660]  I appreciate Emily changing the vibes with different sound effects.
[52:30.740 --> 52:32.300]  I feel like I need to convince them
[52:32.300 --> 52:35.000]  to get everything off the table and onto stuff behind them.
[52:35.460 --> 52:36.240]  Oh, my God.
[52:36.280 --> 52:36.560]  Again.
[52:37.240 --> 52:38.720]  Hey, Gavin, do you want a Kerwin Frost?
[52:39.240 --> 52:40.180]  I'd love one.
[52:40.640 --> 52:41.800]  I love Kerwin Flombe.
[52:54.540 --> 52:55.720]  What is it going to be?
[52:57.100 --> 52:58.060]  He is doing it.
[52:58.880 --> 52:59.820]  Oh, my God.
[52:59.820 --> 53:01.440]  All the suspense is off camera.
[53:05.060 --> 53:06.000]  Was that all of them?
[53:06.500 --> 53:06.820]  All right.
[53:06.920 --> 53:07.860]  No, there's no...
[53:09.140 --> 53:10.280]  How many are left?
[53:10.680 --> 53:11.680]  Nine of these things.
[53:11.960 --> 53:12.660]  Six left.
[53:13.300 --> 53:14.280]  Oh, we're up to ten.
[53:15.020 --> 53:15.200]  Oh.
[53:15.780 --> 53:16.680]  There have been ten?
[53:17.760 --> 53:18.160]  Nine?
[53:18.460 --> 53:19.160]  You said eighteen?
[53:19.160 --> 53:19.960]  OK, well, I got Kerwin Frost.
[53:20.440 --> 53:21.040]  I don't know.
[53:21.100 --> 53:22.120]  He said multiple numbers.
[53:22.480 --> 53:23.580]  I thought it was 15.
[53:24.180 --> 53:26.120]  He said 15 at the start, but who knows?
[53:26.180 --> 53:27.100]  I thought I sent like 20.
[53:30.220 --> 53:30.980]  What's the next one?
[53:30.980 --> 53:31.880]  OK, so we got a Kerwin.
[53:32.120 --> 53:32.700]  Oh, no.
[53:33.360 --> 53:35.420]  I don't like that shot of all the dupe we get.
[53:35.500 --> 53:35.920]  That's great.
[53:37.280 --> 53:39.100]  Come on, Darla, Darla, Darla.
[53:40.700 --> 53:42.680]  Fucking bald-headed ass Moe.
[53:44.500 --> 53:45.560]  So many Moes.
[53:45.580 --> 53:46.660]  This piece of shit.
[53:46.980 --> 53:48.640]  Moe was my favorite until now.
[53:49.800 --> 53:50.960]  I swear to God.
[53:51.360 --> 53:51.900]  No more Moe.
[53:51.980 --> 53:52.420]  No more Moe.
[53:57.680 --> 54:01.720]  I ate 170 nuggets for fucking 16 Moes.
[54:02.940 --> 54:03.940]  When did they get to see me?
[54:05.260 --> 54:06.840]  Oh, they said cold nuggets.
[54:07.020 --> 54:08.960]  The fourth consecutive day of cold.
[54:09.140 --> 54:10.300]  God damn it.
[54:11.900 --> 54:12.500]  Fuck.
[54:13.480 --> 54:13.820]  OK.
[54:15.140 --> 54:15.500]  How many?
[54:15.860 --> 54:16.160]  Yeah.
[54:16.640 --> 54:17.240]  No, I don't.
[54:17.520 --> 54:19.060]  Emily, Emily.
[54:19.060 --> 54:27.130]  OK, I respect her wanting the gold one so they could just take it.
[54:28.090 --> 54:29.370]  Andrew, can it be?
[54:29.570 --> 54:30.490]  Will you get Darla?
[54:30.830 --> 54:31.590]  Come on, Darla.
[54:32.510 --> 54:34.770]  You yellow muffed son of a bitch.
[54:35.070 --> 54:35.590]  Come on.
[54:37.950 --> 54:39.230]  That's not Darla Gavin.
[54:39.970 --> 54:41.570]  I don't even know her name.
[54:42.010 --> 54:43.230]  Glazed donut head.
[54:45.050 --> 54:45.570]  Bernice?
[54:45.710 --> 54:46.270]  I think that was the one.
[54:48.010 --> 54:49.130]  I don't know.
[54:49.730 --> 54:50.790]  I feel like you do.
[54:50.790 --> 54:51.570]  It wasn't.
[54:51.730 --> 54:52.310]  I think he knew.
[54:52.410 --> 54:53.390]  I think he's playing it up.
[54:53.510 --> 54:54.470]  He's being an ass.
[54:54.530 --> 54:55.250]  God damn him.
[54:55.410 --> 54:57.750]  Andrew, that's OK.
[54:58.610 --> 54:59.970]  We're down to the last three.
[55:00.830 --> 55:02.250]  We have three left.
[55:02.770 --> 55:05.010]  I've been waiting for an hour to be disappointed.
[55:05.690 --> 55:06.770]  It's not over yet, Andrew.
[55:06.910 --> 55:08.250]  It's not over yet, because you win.
[55:08.590 --> 55:09.830]  OK, we got three of another.
[55:14.790 --> 55:17.570]  No, oh, it looks so promising.
[55:20.990 --> 55:22.630]  Oh, my God.
[55:22.630 --> 55:24.370]  We're going to make Gracie throw these up, Tim.
[55:24.490 --> 55:27.270]  But we got to up, up, down most to become a star.
[55:30.790 --> 55:34.850]  It needs to be the next Tom Brady, a McDonald's.
[55:35.730 --> 55:37.430]  Well, you got a lot of the ones you didn't have.
[55:38.810 --> 55:40.950]  And we need a Darla for Andrew.
[55:41.670 --> 55:44.550]  I don't I don't care if they get gold.
[55:45.190 --> 55:46.450]  Just give me Darla.
[55:47.390 --> 55:48.790]  I need a Darla.
[55:52.370 --> 55:53.410]  OK, OK.
[55:59.990 --> 56:01.030]  Fuck me.
[56:01.210 --> 56:02.610]  Oh, my Jesus Christ.
[56:03.650 --> 56:06.370]  How many duplicates of Kerwin Frost do I have?
[56:06.450 --> 56:07.930]  You mailed him four Kershaw's.
[56:08.350 --> 56:10.230]  I only needed one.
[56:12.090 --> 56:12.750]  Yeah, they're awesome.
[56:13.370 --> 56:14.250]  They're fry shoes.
[56:14.410 --> 56:14.910]  You can buy them.
[56:14.970 --> 56:15.590]  They're clogs.
[56:15.590 --> 56:16.370]  They're really stupid.
[56:17.390 --> 56:18.430]  I hate this.
[56:18.610 --> 56:20.210]  I fucking hate this.
[56:21.290 --> 56:21.590]  Fingers crossed.
[56:21.910 --> 56:24.110]  OK, I got my fingers and my ass crossed for you.
[56:24.250 --> 56:26.030]  There's no way it's going to be Darla, but this is it.
[56:26.050 --> 56:26.850]  Come on. I got to believe.
[56:27.670 --> 56:28.550]  Miracles can happen.
[56:28.650 --> 56:29.450]  Good things can happen.
[56:30.210 --> 56:31.050]  Oh, it's going to be a mo.
[56:31.370 --> 56:31.990]  Oh, it's my.
[56:32.170 --> 56:33.790]  No, but this is my dragon year.
[56:33.990 --> 56:34.790]  This is my dragon.
[56:34.910 --> 56:36.030]  This is your dragon year.
[56:36.190 --> 56:37.230]  Year of the dog.
[56:38.430 --> 56:39.610]  No, no, no.
[56:40.090 --> 56:41.670]  I can see what's coming.
[56:41.890 --> 56:43.430]  Fucking dragons, Gavin.
[56:43.790 --> 56:45.010]  These fucking dragons.
[56:45.010 --> 56:46.310]  I'm sick of it.
[56:46.690 --> 56:48.770]  We're only in January, Gavin.
[56:49.310 --> 56:51.690]  I got 11 more months of this.
[56:51.810 --> 56:53.570]  Oh, God.
[56:55.850 --> 56:57.310]  Oh, my God.
[56:58.350 --> 57:00.850]  I spent so much money on happy meals.
[57:01.290 --> 57:04.330]  So wait, so was there another one that didn't come up once?
[57:04.590 --> 57:05.470]  How many are there? Six?
[57:06.090 --> 57:09.270]  There's I, Gavin, there's six of them.
[57:10.210 --> 57:12.350]  How'd you get so many of the same one?
[57:12.410 --> 57:13.690]  I don't know.
[57:16.830 --> 57:17.710]  I don't know.
[57:18.130 --> 57:18.770]  Fucking dragon years.
[57:18.930 --> 57:20.290]  That's how that's how this happened.
[57:20.370 --> 57:21.190]  The fucking dragons.
[57:21.490 --> 57:22.790]  I'm protesting dragons.
[57:23.050 --> 57:24.130]  You're the exception.
[57:24.710 --> 57:27.090]  Every other dragon getting is gone.
[57:27.430 --> 57:28.570]  No magic dragons.
[57:28.850 --> 57:32.610]  I might watch Reign of Fire just to see some some dragon death.
[57:35.530 --> 57:36.710]  Oh, my God.
[57:38.170 --> 57:41.430]  But kind of the only thing that I do like is that Andrew didn't get the one.
[57:41.490 --> 57:44.090]  Yeah. Yeah, that's let's be honest.
[57:44.950 --> 57:45.630]  He's fucking.
[57:46.190 --> 57:49.090]  Yeah, because I'm recording an hour of this, Eric.
[57:49.590 --> 57:51.270]  He's having a quiet time. Yeah, absolutely.
[57:51.710 --> 57:54.070]  No, I'm not. I would love to be having quiet time in the bath.
[57:54.450 --> 57:55.430]  Yeah. Turn the lights off.
[57:55.830 --> 57:56.430]  Lit a candle.
[57:56.670 --> 57:59.030]  Does it make sense that I'm responding to the video?
[57:59.230 --> 58:01.390]  I just realized I'm just so annoyed.
[58:01.770 --> 58:03.270]  Oh, my God. I can't believe.
[58:03.390 --> 58:06.210]  Can I? I need to check if I can order happy meals right now.
[58:07.990 --> 58:09.250]  Oh, I'm sure you could.
[58:09.930 --> 58:12.490]  Let's see, because most of them are sold out.
[58:12.490 --> 58:13.730]  Last time I checked, I couldn't.
[58:15.090 --> 58:16.950]  I'm going to be so goddamn mad.
[58:17.650 --> 58:20.030]  Yeah, we told you this and then you didn't send in the cake.
[58:24.630 --> 58:26.150]  I kind of want a happy meal now.
[58:27.410 --> 58:29.190]  Well, let's open up some baseball cards.
[58:30.050 --> 58:31.470]  They don't have them anymore.
[58:31.790 --> 58:32.770]  No, they've been gone for a while.
[58:32.870 --> 58:33.930]  I think I'm going to have to eBay him.
[58:33.970 --> 58:36.530]  He's going to see if someone will take his BTS sauces and trade.
[58:36.590 --> 58:37.350]  He's going to have to trade.
[58:37.450 --> 58:39.950]  Oh, fuck. I hate when I don't have my phone with me.
[58:39.970 --> 58:42.970]  And it just I tried to log in and said, verify that about it.
[58:42.990 --> 58:44.710]  Oh, wait, is it just bypassing its own?
[58:45.250 --> 58:46.890]  Yeah, it did. That's fucking awesome.
[58:47.290 --> 58:50.350]  It just tried to two factor me and said, ah, don't worry about it.
[58:51.510 --> 58:52.530]  Just the one factor today.
[58:53.470 --> 58:54.770]  One factor for you.
[58:54.870 --> 58:56.030]  We know the pain you're going through.
[58:56.110 --> 58:57.730]  Let's see the closest McDonald's.
[58:58.170 --> 58:59.350]  Well, he got to him.
[59:04.160 --> 59:07.540]  Oh, we got a hot honey McCrispy going on right now.
[59:08.980 --> 59:09.840]  It's pretty good.
[59:10.100 --> 59:13.260]  I don't know if you have that available to you, but I would recommend it.
[59:14.060 --> 59:15.920]  Well, I can't order anything from McDonald's
[59:15.920 --> 59:16.700]  that isn't a Big Mac.
[59:18.840 --> 59:22.860]  Oh, OK, and then Gavin, they still have them.
[59:22.940 --> 59:23.580]  Should I order one?
[59:23.700 --> 59:25.540]  Oh, but next week.
[59:25.740 --> 59:28.520]  Yes, I'm going to order one more.
[59:28.720 --> 59:30.060]  There's 17 dollars.
[59:30.640 --> 59:31.060]  Why?
[59:31.300 --> 59:34.280]  They're so because they're adult happy meals and the toy.
[59:36.340 --> 59:38.460]  Look at Jonathan Aranda's face there.
[59:38.560 --> 59:42.680]  He is. Oh, that's not a good sign.
[59:43.460 --> 59:44.940]  Oh, wait, never mind. It's fine.
[59:44.940 --> 59:45.780]  I want the nuggets.
[59:46.560 --> 59:48.340]  Well, I'm going to order one more of these.
[59:49.840 --> 59:51.040]  We could wrap this up.
[59:51.140 --> 59:51.780]  Well, I don't care about.
[59:51.900 --> 59:52.800]  Do you care about baseball?
[59:53.760 --> 59:54.880]  I don't even know the rules.
[59:55.540 --> 59:56.080]  Now. Yeah.
[59:56.240 --> 59:57.260]  Maybe we should play baseball.
[59:57.840 --> 01:00:00.320]  Didn't you almost win face off in baseball?
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:01.780]  Where did you place?
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.340]  Well, I mean, watching baseball isn't really anything I did
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:06.240]  or contributed to.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:07.940]  That's fair.
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.920]  What you did contribute to, though, is this this recording.
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.220]  My misery. Thank you for joining me, Gavin.
[01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:14.840]  Thanks for having me watch along.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:15.880]  This is weird.
[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:19.700]  I'm excited to maybe do something like this again.
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:22.600]  I'm going to finish my outro before Eric does.
[01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:23.900]  Fuck you, Eric.
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:25.740]  I say that lovingly. Bye.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.880]  Look at his schmuck little head.
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.800]  You look so small with that helmet.
