[00:29.920 --> 00:36.960]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is episode 33,
[00:37.700 --> 00:44.500]  our very special Christmas episode. What the fuck that was in the background? Because it clipped.
[00:45.080 --> 00:45.220]  Happy holidays!
[00:45.220 --> 00:51.560]  My name is Jeff Ramsey. With you, as always, my co-hosts Eric Baddour, Andrew Panton,
[00:51.560 --> 00:54.420]  Gavin Free, and Nick Schwartz. Merry Christmas, boys!
[00:55.120 --> 00:56.000]  Merry Christmas.
[00:56.500 --> 00:58.700]  I was screaming it's Christmas from that Slade song.
[00:58.920 --> 01:02.320]  Oh. I gotta be honest with you guys, I'm thinking I'm done with bagels.
[01:02.580 --> 01:04.280]  Real 7 out of 10 food, if you ask me.
[01:04.500 --> 01:05.440]  What? You're insane.
[01:05.720 --> 01:06.320]  Not a fan.
[01:06.500 --> 01:07.520]  Bagels are the best.
[01:08.900 --> 01:12.520]  It's such a high score to stop wanting to eat it. I don't understand.
[01:12.880 --> 01:15.740]  Speaking of snow, Belichick, apparently,
[01:16.120 --> 01:19.560]  according to Eric, North Carolina hires Bill Belichick, legendary NFL coach.
[01:19.980 --> 01:20.540]  That's awesome.
[01:20.540 --> 01:23.240]  Joins college ranks and stunning career move.
[01:23.380 --> 01:26.220]  The five-year deal, right? What they were saying yesterday.
[01:26.520 --> 01:29.120]  Is it a stunning career move? He's still coaching football.
[01:30.440 --> 01:32.220]  Stunning career. That's what happened. Well,
[01:32.480 --> 01:35.620]  they shut down Rooster Teeth and in a stunning career move, we kept doing podcasts.
[01:35.960 --> 01:40.280]  Yeah, like it's, I don't, if he became like a basketball coach,
[01:40.340 --> 01:44.180]  that would be a stunning career move. They're like, hey, he is coaching Charlotte.
[01:44.180 --> 01:48.780]  If he became like a dog show competitor, I think that would be a stunning career move.
[01:48.780 --> 01:52.540]  A dog show competitor? Like he's not even a coach. He's on the...
[01:52.540 --> 01:55.640]  No, no. Like he's like got a dog that he takes to dog shows and stuff.
[01:55.820 --> 01:56.820]  Yeah. Like best in show.
[01:56.980 --> 01:58.700]  Oh, did you think I meant like he's a dog?
[01:59.680 --> 02:04.640]  Oh, he does have a dog. His dog drafted for the Patriots. He's got a very skilled dog.
[02:05.020 --> 02:07.700]  Is there a human dog show that people could do?
[02:07.940 --> 02:08.460]  What do you mean?
[02:08.780 --> 02:09.280]  The Olympics.
[02:10.880 --> 02:15.020]  Isn't that what a beauty pageant is? A beauty pageant is just a human dog show?
[02:15.320 --> 02:17.140]  Yeah. They have to jump over bars and stuff.
[02:17.140 --> 02:21.260]  There are human dog shows where humans run around and jump over bars and stuff.
[02:21.340 --> 02:23.940]  I don't know if they're dogs, but they do it as horses.
[02:24.840 --> 02:29.260]  I've seen on TikTok, there's like women or dudes will run around with like the stick.
[02:29.600 --> 02:32.760]  Oh, they have like the wooden horse competition thing where it's like,
[02:32.800 --> 02:35.100]  yeah, they have like the horse stick horse thing.
[02:35.360 --> 02:36.860]  Stick horse dressage or whatever.
[02:39.580 --> 02:40.340]  The Olympics.
[02:40.800 --> 02:43.820]  I'm trying to think who I think would crawl through the tube the fastest
[02:43.820 --> 02:45.140]  between the four of you.
[02:45.480 --> 02:46.000]  Tube crawling?
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.680]  Tube crawling, because the dogs run in and out of the tube.
[02:48.920 --> 02:50.220]  Oh, I bet it's Nick.
[02:51.240 --> 02:52.720]  Yeah, I think it's Nick.
[02:52.720 --> 02:53.100]  Yeah, it's Nick.
[02:53.300 --> 02:53.920]  How's it Nick?
[02:54.700 --> 02:55.480]  I'm fast as fuck.
[02:55.500 --> 02:58.060]  Why are you offended by it?
[02:58.980 --> 03:01.000]  You think you could crawl through some tubes pretty quick?
[03:01.340 --> 03:03.520]  I think I could race through some tubes.
[03:03.840 --> 03:04.140]  Really?
[03:04.780 --> 03:06.040]  I think I was built for the tubes.
[03:06.360 --> 03:10.360]  I think the Gavin of five years ago could race through some tubes, but come on, man.
[03:11.740 --> 03:13.180]  Wait, how old are you, Nick?
[03:13.360 --> 03:13.780]  36.
[03:13.780 --> 03:15.800]  Well, as of this episode, 37.
[03:16.180 --> 03:16.840]  Happy birthday.
[03:17.180 --> 03:18.280]  Happy birthday.
[03:19.480 --> 03:20.800]  How long is the tube?
[03:21.380 --> 03:22.320]  What are the dimensions?
[03:22.680 --> 03:23.640]  It's a curved tube.
[03:23.960 --> 03:27.420]  Let's say it's maybe 10 feet from one entrance to the exit.
[03:27.700 --> 03:30.620]  I could probably just go full sprint and just slide through that puppy.
[03:30.900 --> 03:32.000]  Yeah, I'd be flying.
[03:32.180 --> 03:33.980]  Are you dolphin diving like in Call of Duty?
[03:34.480 --> 03:37.680]  I mean, for ultimate speed, I think I could be in and out of that tube in like maybe a
[03:37.680 --> 03:38.320]  second and a half.
[03:38.620 --> 03:40.020]  Oh, really?
[03:40.300 --> 03:40.520]  Yeah.
[03:41.020 --> 03:43.980]  I would put good money on Nick to beat you.
[03:43.980 --> 03:45.920]  Oh, I would also do that.
[03:46.100 --> 03:46.900]  Oh, I think I got it.
[03:46.980 --> 03:49.460]  I never thought about what the inside of those tubes look like.
[03:49.500 --> 03:50.300]  Oh, that's great.
[03:50.420 --> 03:54.580]  It's just an image of a child's tube at like a playground.
[03:55.120 --> 03:55.820]  Very small.
[03:55.920 --> 03:57.040]  Oh, I wouldn't even touch it.
[03:57.160 --> 03:57.920]  I just fly through it.
[03:57.920 --> 04:03.120]  Yeah, I would touch the outside wall or the inside of the outside of the turn.
[04:03.340 --> 04:03.540]  What?
[04:03.780 --> 04:04.240]  On the wall.
[04:04.300 --> 04:05.200]  And I would just slide through.
[04:06.260 --> 04:09.080]  The inside of the outside of the turn.
[04:09.540 --> 04:11.940]  I just watched a season of Survivor.
[04:12.200 --> 04:15.300]  The stringy long dude always wins.
[04:15.560 --> 04:17.040]  Always wins competitions.
[04:17.660 --> 04:18.280]  How long are you, Nick?
[04:18.300 --> 04:22.600]  Nick has got the most survivor stringy long dude body of us all.
[04:22.840 --> 04:23.520]  I'm not that long.
[04:23.600 --> 04:24.320]  I'm pretty, I'm short.
[04:24.620 --> 04:25.480]  I'm 5'10 long.
[04:25.600 --> 04:26.340]  I'm 5'9 long.
[04:26.520 --> 04:27.380]  I'm putting the tube in.
[04:27.420 --> 04:29.060]  Yeah, but it's about like body distribution.
[04:29.360 --> 04:32.360]  And like he's real, he's real like, like Nick's kind of rangy.
[04:33.580 --> 04:35.200]  So it's a long tube.
[04:35.300 --> 04:37.500]  It is like kind of fabric-y.
[04:37.500 --> 04:40.840]  So if you dive through, you're just going to move the whole tube.
[04:41.040 --> 04:42.240]  The whole thing is moving.
[04:42.440 --> 04:44.220]  Yeah, you can't really slide through it.
[04:44.320 --> 04:46.240]  So is technique going to be...
[04:46.240 --> 04:48.080]  I think shoe choice is going to be very important.
[04:48.240 --> 04:49.220]  Really? You're using shoes?
[04:49.560 --> 04:50.220]  That dog looks...
[04:50.840 --> 04:53.700]  Eric posted a photo of a dog running out of tube and it looks like...
[04:53.700 --> 04:56.640]  I'm finding, I'm finding the best images of this.
[04:56.880 --> 04:59.560]  Look at this dog like posted up.
[04:59.980 --> 05:02.240]  There's a cat at the other end.
[05:02.660 --> 05:03.620]  Hey, Eric?
[05:04.120 --> 05:04.560]  Yeah?
[05:04.560 --> 05:08.900]  That image with the cat at the other end, that's clearly an Amazon sale product.
[05:09.100 --> 05:10.080]  That's something we could buy.
[05:10.300 --> 05:11.820]  Can we buy that? Can you buy that?
[05:13.240 --> 05:15.680]  It's 16 and a half feet.
[05:16.240 --> 05:18.960]  It is, oh man, I just don't know if it's...
[05:18.960 --> 05:20.340]  Oh no, currently unavailable.
[05:20.580 --> 05:21.100]  I'll find one.
[05:21.540 --> 05:23.300]  I don't understand these product dimensions.
[05:23.460 --> 05:27.120]  If there's a way that you guys can explain this to me.
[05:27.320 --> 05:33.820]  It is 5.05L, 0.6W, and 0.6H meters.
[05:33.820 --> 05:35.000]  Everything's in meters.
[05:35.160 --> 05:37.460]  What don't you understand about any of that?
[05:37.720 --> 05:39.460]  So I know exactly what that says.
[05:39.580 --> 05:43.520]  That's 5.5 long, so that's 15 feet, right?
[05:44.220 --> 05:47.760]  And then 0.6 width and 0.6 height.
[05:47.880 --> 05:53.180]  So that puts it at about 1.7 feet wide and not tall, right?
[05:53.660 --> 05:54.500]  Something about that?
[05:54.660 --> 05:56.740]  I think that's a three second tube for me.
[05:56.940 --> 06:00.140]  And you think that you have tube confidence because of your Italian heritage.
[06:00.840 --> 06:02.260]  Are we known for our tubing?
[06:02.260 --> 06:02.960]  Mario!
[06:03.560 --> 06:04.340]  He's making a Mario.
[06:04.400 --> 06:07.580]  Oh, the most iconic...
[06:07.580 --> 06:09.360]  Boy, that didn't come across... I don't know.
[06:10.320 --> 06:11.100]  He's a tube guy.
[06:11.200 --> 06:13.340]  The most iconic tube guy is Italian.
[06:13.580 --> 06:17.100]  Okay, instead, I'm going to need that tube to be green, just so I feel at home.
[06:17.380 --> 06:18.960]  Do you think of Mario as a tube guy?
[06:19.060 --> 06:20.280]  Think of him as a pipe guy.
[06:20.420 --> 06:22.100]  A tube and a pipe is the same, is it not?
[06:22.600 --> 06:26.620]  I don't think so, because when you said a tube and he's Italian,
[06:26.840 --> 06:28.760]  it didn't come across as Mario to me.
[06:28.820 --> 06:30.820]  It came across as very confusing.
[06:30.820 --> 06:33.040]  That sounds like a you problem to me.
[06:33.260 --> 06:35.260]  Oh, okay, cool, great, thank you.
[06:35.340 --> 06:35.980]  They got it!
[06:36.420 --> 06:38.020]  Sample size was 50-50.
[06:39.100 --> 06:42.260]  So I think we should get one of these and then we'll each...
[06:43.020 --> 06:45.000]  To make it fair, you know when they do like land speed records,
[06:45.100 --> 06:47.720]  they have to race both directions and then they take the average.
[06:47.960 --> 06:48.620]  Oh, that's great.
[06:48.860 --> 06:50.300]  Just so there's no like wind advantage.
[06:50.700 --> 06:53.420]  So I think we both do two and we'll average our two scores.
[06:53.600 --> 06:53.960]  Okay.
[06:54.080 --> 06:55.220]  And find out who's the most Italian.
[06:55.400 --> 06:56.440]  I'll practice on my kids.
[06:58.320 --> 06:59.400]  That sounded really weird.
[06:59.400 --> 07:00.700]  I found one.
[07:01.040 --> 07:05.140]  It's 18 feet long, which is what we're looking for, right?
[07:05.540 --> 07:07.600]  And then this is like not crazy.
[07:07.600 --> 07:10.560]  We want to bump that circumference up if we can a little bit, but that's all.
[07:10.600 --> 07:11.220]  That's what I'm looking for.
[07:11.280 --> 07:13.420]  That's the hard part is that when you get length,
[07:13.580 --> 07:16.700]  I think you're kind of sacrificing height on some of these.
[07:16.840 --> 07:19.220]  But I think maybe I found a couple.
[07:19.660 --> 07:22.220]  I think I'm just most blown away that the resident rat guy
[07:22.220 --> 07:24.960]  isn't getting involved in the, you know, rat run type.
[07:25.080 --> 07:26.180]  Oh, I'm not the fastest.
[07:26.400 --> 07:27.400]  Nick would be the fastest.
[07:27.880 --> 07:29.000]  We'll put a piece of cheese at the end.
[07:29.000 --> 07:30.840]  You don't think you could scramble and make that happen?
[07:31.400 --> 07:32.360]  Not, not faster than Nick.
[07:32.440 --> 07:34.840]  No, no, I, I really, I really do think would,
[07:35.000 --> 07:37.180]  I think Nick would be the fastest at dog sports.
[07:37.320 --> 07:37.700]  Oh, yeah.
[07:40.060 --> 07:41.220]  I mean, you know.
[07:41.220 --> 07:42.760]  No, I think it's a perfect way to put it.
[07:42.880 --> 07:43.680]  I, I agree.
[07:43.820 --> 07:46.100]  I completely understand what he means and agree with him.
[07:46.360 --> 07:47.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[07:47.260 --> 07:48.500]  So here's what I found.
[07:48.500 --> 07:50.180]  And I might, I might order this.
[07:50.540 --> 07:52.220]  Oh, looks like it's right.
[07:53.660 --> 07:54.020]  Yeah.
[07:54.420 --> 07:55.940]  Is there a color that we want?
[07:56.220 --> 07:56.580]  Red?
[07:56.920 --> 07:57.120]  Green.
[07:57.740 --> 07:58.560]  Oh, there's a dark.
[07:58.560 --> 08:01.080]  Is this, does this read green to you?
[08:01.100 --> 08:03.540]  I'm just making sure that that reads green to you.
[08:03.600 --> 08:05.360]  And it's not going to be a thing where it's like, that's gray.
[08:05.740 --> 08:06.360]  It's like, is that right?
[08:06.440 --> 08:06.780]  I'm fine with that.
[08:07.040 --> 08:07.380]  Close enough.
[08:08.860 --> 08:11.180]  Okay, then I think that's it.
[08:11.200 --> 08:14.660]  I'll order it and then we'll set it up in Jeff's backyard, I guess.
[08:15.200 --> 08:17.660]  It looks like, it looks like we can add Ben's.
[08:17.660 --> 08:18.340]  How long is it?
[08:18.760 --> 08:19.080]  18.
[08:19.320 --> 08:19.820]  It is.
[08:20.340 --> 08:21.700]  My current backyard is not big enough.
[08:21.760 --> 08:22.940]  We'll have to take it to the park and do it.
[08:22.960 --> 08:25.260]  No, no, no, we can, we can put some Ben's in it and stuff.
[08:25.320 --> 08:25.820]  You know what I mean?
[08:25.840 --> 08:26.960]  Like, it doesn't have to go the full 18.
[08:26.960 --> 08:29.680]  It can go like nine and then like nine to curve back around.
[08:29.800 --> 08:31.620]  So that way, like the start and the end are like the same.
[08:32.060 --> 08:35.560]  Can we bring items that we think might help us?
[08:36.100 --> 08:40.240]  Like, like your favorite chew toy or like a leash?
[08:40.580 --> 08:41.460]  Like a Scooby snack.
[08:41.700 --> 08:42.120]  What are we thinking?
[08:42.300 --> 08:45.180]  I was thinking maybe like a lube-soaked t-shirt.
[08:45.820 --> 08:52.080]  Uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna say no on a lube-soaked t-shirt just because I don't want to see it.
[08:52.080 --> 08:57.720]  Yeah, also, also, I feel like lubricant is something that both competitors have to agree on
[08:57.720 --> 09:02.420]  because when one is lubricated, both are, you know, at the end of the day.
[09:02.800 --> 09:05.120]  Like, Nick's gonna get all messy going through that after you.
[09:05.820 --> 09:07.360]  If he's not on board with it, you know.
[09:07.480 --> 09:10.980]  I actually feel it could be advantageous to the person going through who,
[09:11.300 --> 09:13.400]  like, that might be too slippery for Gavin.
[09:13.660 --> 09:15.300]  He might just be rolling in this tube.
[09:15.440 --> 09:16.860]  You think he'd be over lubed?
[09:16.860 --> 09:22.120]  Yeah, I think he would properly lube the tube for Nick to just slide on through.
[09:22.420 --> 09:26.620]  I'm, I'm hoping that I would be running full tilt and I just glide through all lubed,
[09:26.680 --> 09:29.360]  and then Nick goes for like a, a scrambling approach,
[09:29.480 --> 09:32.260]  but he just, he doesn't get perched and he's just slipping around in there.
[09:32.400 --> 09:34.420]  He like wobbles like on a cartoon, he's like,
[09:35.020 --> 09:38.300]  because he can't catch, can't catch a grip.
[09:38.700 --> 09:38.940]  Yeah.
[09:42.700 --> 09:45.160]  So does anyone else want to get involved and try with us?
[09:45.160 --> 09:47.120]  I trust you, I think you're good.
[09:47.360 --> 09:52.340]  I'm happy to do it, but I'm also fucking 50 years old essentially at this point,
[09:52.420 --> 09:53.960]  so I don't think there's any chance in hell
[09:53.960 --> 09:56.400]  that in my advanced age I'm going to do anything other than
[09:56.400 --> 10:01.080]  cause some sort of a nagging injury that will happen for six to eight weeks.
[10:01.680 --> 10:04.320]  Yeah, you're still recovering from the dog toy being thrown at you.
[10:04.460 --> 10:06.020]  I'm concerned about...
[10:06.020 --> 10:07.640]  I still deal with a face.
[10:07.880 --> 10:09.260]  Yeah, that's true.
[10:09.580 --> 10:11.980]  I was at the dentist right before we recorded today.
[10:12.220 --> 10:14.920]  Oh, did you, you get injections? Do you have Botox yet?
[10:14.920 --> 10:18.720]  I haven't done the Botox yet, but I have been doing dry needling, which is pretty bad.
[10:19.120 --> 10:20.080]  Oh, God.
[10:20.220 --> 10:24.600]  It's like acupuncture, but they move the needle around
[10:24.600 --> 10:27.700]  and once it's inside of you and pop stuff like muscles.
[10:27.920 --> 10:28.660]  Oh, God.
[10:29.100 --> 10:29.880]  To cause spasms, so.
[10:30.200 --> 10:31.400]  Oh, that sounds terrible.
[10:31.620 --> 10:34.980]  It's like, take the thing about the thing of the worst part of acupuncture
[10:34.980 --> 10:37.360]  and then like make it significantly worse.
[10:37.980 --> 10:41.140]  Is there medical science that shows that that works?
[10:41.140 --> 10:42.020]  I assume so.
[10:42.140 --> 10:46.920]  I just go to the guy behind the HEB, but he's got to have science from somewhere, right?
[10:47.080 --> 10:47.900]  Now, of course there's medical.
[10:48.020 --> 10:50.720]  I'm going to like a sports therapist to get it done.
[10:50.800 --> 10:51.500]  Well, that isn't...
[10:51.500 --> 10:51.700]  Okay.
[10:52.060 --> 10:53.660]  I feel like some of that stuff is sketchy.
[10:53.820 --> 10:55.700]  Not as in like, like you can hit the ball.
[10:55.780 --> 10:59.140]  You just have to believe in yourself, but more like you've got an injury and here's how we fix it.
[10:59.340 --> 11:02.900]  Like, I don't think cupping does anything, but that's like a predominant thing.
[11:03.280 --> 11:03.540]  I don't know.
[11:03.580 --> 11:04.720]  I've never done, never done cupping.
[11:05.020 --> 11:06.200]  Oh, I really like it.
[11:06.420 --> 11:09.040]  It helped me with a lot of range of motion when I was having it.
[11:09.060 --> 11:09.400]  Oh, really?
[11:09.640 --> 11:10.380]  Yeah, it's my back.
[11:10.400 --> 11:11.120]  I really liked it.
[11:11.120 --> 11:12.300]  But don't worry.
[11:12.420 --> 11:15.740]  People leave comments and go, it's actually fake and you don't, and don't worry about it.
[11:15.800 --> 11:15.940]  Fair enough.
[11:15.940 --> 11:17.480]  It worked for me and I really liked it.
[11:17.580 --> 11:18.000]  Yeah, that's awesome.
[11:18.000 --> 11:18.600]  I really enjoyed it.
[11:18.700 --> 11:19.640]  Pretty popular in the NBA.
[11:20.040 --> 11:22.340]  And I know Emily has had it done before, but I have no experience.
[11:23.240 --> 11:25.800]  What about the balloon in the nostril thing?
[11:26.140 --> 11:27.240]  You ever thought about getting that done?
[11:27.360 --> 11:28.060]  Have you ever needed that?
[11:28.140 --> 11:29.440]  I don't think we're allowed to do that.
[11:29.500 --> 11:31.140]  Didn't we agree that we're not allowed to do that?
[11:31.280 --> 11:32.080]  No, that's throats.
[11:32.340 --> 11:32.820]  That's throats.
[11:33.020 --> 11:34.020]  This is the nostril.
[11:34.240 --> 11:37.260]  I feel like the sinuses should not be messed with it that way.
[11:37.260 --> 11:42.260]  The guy that's down for having the balloon explode in his mouth is worried about the
[11:42.260 --> 11:42.980]  nostril balloon?
[11:44.080 --> 11:47.700]  Yeah, a balloon in the mouth that it's just being lightly inflated to see how big your
[11:47.700 --> 11:52.700]  mouth is isn't the same as stuffing a balloon up my nose and popping my sinus hole.
[11:53.120 --> 11:54.900]  Balloon in the mouth is worth two in the nose, man.
[11:55.000 --> 11:56.720]  It's, you know, you gotta make a decision.
[11:57.020 --> 12:01.740]  Do you think your nostril holes are equal to your nose size generally, Gavin?
[12:01.820 --> 12:05.440]  Do you think the interior matches the exterior as far as...
[12:05.440 --> 12:06.460]  My nostrils are garbage.
[12:06.460 --> 12:07.280]  Really?
[12:07.680 --> 12:08.280]  They're tiny.
[12:08.600 --> 12:09.980]  It just narrows down.
[12:10.180 --> 12:11.000]  That sucks.
[12:11.180 --> 12:12.140]  They're completely useless.
[12:12.460 --> 12:16.160]  Do you think they're the same size or like one is better than the other?
[12:16.220 --> 12:20.800]  Because like everybody has like one ball that hangs lower and all boobs are different,
[12:20.880 --> 12:21.100]  right?
[12:21.140 --> 12:23.600]  So you've got to figure your nostrils would be slightly...
[12:23.600 --> 12:25.540]  Like, is your left one better than your right one?
[12:25.660 --> 12:29.720]  If I inhale deeply and suddenly my right nostril collapses.
[12:30.020 --> 12:30.440]  What?
[12:30.680 --> 12:31.220]  Well, there you go.
[12:32.200 --> 12:34.380]  Do you not have like a weaker nostril if you go like...
[12:34.380 --> 12:35.500]  It like slams closed?
[12:35.500 --> 12:35.920]  No.
[12:37.140 --> 12:39.360]  Lay off the cocaine, buddy. Jesus.
[12:42.760 --> 12:43.740]  Slams closed?
[12:44.240 --> 12:49.080]  Wait, so is your nose so powerful that the suction is like...
[12:49.080 --> 12:50.460]  It's bringing it in?
[12:50.940 --> 12:51.160]  Yeah.
[12:51.960 --> 12:52.480]  That's...
[12:52.480 --> 12:54.460]  There's a lot of give on my nostril flaps.
[12:55.040 --> 12:55.460]  They're very...
[12:56.040 --> 12:57.820]  Oh, you got flappy flaps?
[12:58.200 --> 12:58.460]  Yeah.
[12:58.860 --> 13:01.700]  So if you just take in a massively deep breath,
[13:01.800 --> 13:04.440]  like you're trying to fill your lung in one second through the nose,
[13:04.440 --> 13:06.200]  it just goes in smooth?
[13:06.440 --> 13:08.720]  I mean, it kind of throttles a little bit, but it doesn't...
[13:08.720 --> 13:10.200]  Like, I wouldn't describe it as collapsing.
[13:10.420 --> 13:12.060]  Yeah, it just went in smooth. I got no problem with it.
[13:12.380 --> 13:14.500]  I think, Gavin, we need to get you that nose balloon, man.
[13:14.760 --> 13:16.160]  I think if anyone needs it, it might be you.
[13:16.720 --> 13:19.460]  Yeah, what's that gonna do? Temporarily stretch my nose hole?
[13:19.720 --> 13:19.980]  Yeah.
[13:20.180 --> 13:22.500]  Yeah, we need to get in there and make some lattice work or something.
[13:22.780 --> 13:24.640]  Yeah, I need like a stent or something.
[13:24.780 --> 13:25.860]  Like they do in a mine.
[13:26.120 --> 13:26.780]  I got...
[13:26.780 --> 13:31.080]  What he's describing with like the balloon in your nostril expanding and everything,
[13:31.220 --> 13:32.540]  I did that with my esophagus.
[13:33.100 --> 13:33.400]  Really?
[13:34.300 --> 13:38.500]  I had a stricture and a narrowing in my esophagus where food would get stuck.
[13:40.480 --> 13:44.140]  And I went to a gastroenterologist and they're like,
[13:44.180 --> 13:45.760]  oh yeah, well, we can just like knock you out.
[13:45.780 --> 13:48.420]  And then we shove a balloon down your throat and then we expand the balloon.
[13:48.540 --> 13:50.540]  You'll just have to get it done again in like 15 years.
[13:51.360 --> 13:53.420]  But it was a night and day change.
[13:53.560 --> 13:55.500]  Like my life is so different after that.
[13:55.640 --> 13:56.780]  Did it hurt at all?
[13:56.780 --> 13:58.200]  Like when you woke up, was your throat sore?
[13:58.580 --> 14:01.100]  I mean, like not like my throat,
[14:01.100 --> 14:03.480]  but like the middle of my chest ached for like a day or two.
[14:03.560 --> 14:04.240]  And like, that was it.
[14:04.600 --> 14:05.920]  Like really, really not bad.
[14:06.120 --> 14:07.060]  Can you deep throat now?
[14:07.220 --> 14:07.620]  Uh, yeah.
[14:07.700 --> 14:09.320]  And it can go all the way down to the stomach.
[14:09.460 --> 14:12.200]  So if you like, I don't even have to swallow.
[14:12.420 --> 14:13.660]  That's like the deepest throat.
[14:13.820 --> 14:15.420]  Did you just, if you can get it all the way down there,
[14:15.900 --> 14:18.860]  but you might get, you might get burned by my stomach acid.
[14:19.620 --> 14:21.760]  Can I push a hot dog down your throat?
[14:21.960 --> 14:23.960]  Oh, I don't like it.
[14:25.500 --> 14:26.680]  Can I do what?
[14:26.920 --> 14:28.320]  Can I push a hot dog down your throat?
[14:28.460 --> 14:31.080]  No, it just made my esophagus like a normal person's esophagus.
[14:31.080 --> 14:33.140]  I don't want to see that.
[14:33.280 --> 14:34.780]  I don't, I'm not going to do it.
[14:35.020 --> 14:36.140]  You don't think you could relax it?
[14:36.260 --> 14:36.940]  I could just...
[14:36.940 --> 14:37.620]  No, Eric, don't do it.
[14:37.640 --> 14:39.420]  I know you're thinking about it, but say no.
[14:39.600 --> 14:40.100]  No, absolutely.
[14:40.200 --> 14:41.220]  No, I absolutely couldn't.
[14:41.340 --> 14:44.780]  If Gavin pulls a hot dog from the throat, can he become the king of the land?
[14:44.860 --> 14:45.740]  Is he the chosen one?
[14:48.200 --> 14:50.920]  He's got a balloon in his nostrils getting expanded,
[14:51.040 --> 14:52.660]  pulling a hot dog out of my throat.
[14:52.740 --> 14:53.440]  This is pretty cool.
[14:53.620 --> 14:54.520]  Is that what the show is?
[14:54.660 --> 14:57.400]  I could absolutely fit a hot dog in my nose though.
[14:57.600 --> 14:58.320]  Four out of 10.
[14:59.140 --> 15:01.780]  I bet I could hold two dogs, one in each nostril.
[15:01.880 --> 15:02.840]  They just wouldn't go in very far.
[15:03.040 --> 15:05.160]  Oh, you think you could fit a dog in your nostril?
[15:05.300 --> 15:05.720]  I think so.
[15:05.760 --> 15:06.280]  Let's try it.
[15:06.380 --> 15:08.600]  There's no way, well, mine at least, no way.
[15:08.720 --> 15:09.440]  I bet I could.
[15:09.680 --> 15:11.540]  You just said your nostrils were small.
[15:11.740 --> 15:12.700]  The actual...
[15:12.700 --> 15:13.740]  The pipage is small.
[15:14.040 --> 15:17.980]  Like the tunnel is small, but the openings are, you know, loose and flappy and huge.
[15:18.160 --> 15:18.960]  Hot dog flappy?
[15:19.140 --> 15:19.740]  I think so.
[15:19.880 --> 15:21.400]  How big is a hot dog? Like you could...
[15:21.400 --> 15:23.140]  Not the whole bun, just the...
[15:23.140 --> 15:25.840]  No, I don't think any of us are thinking bun.
[15:26.100 --> 15:27.560]  I think you could do that for sure.
[15:27.560 --> 15:29.240]  You said you could do it too. Do you think so?
[15:29.300 --> 15:31.260]  Yeah, I don't think it's that... I don't think a hot dog is that big.
[15:31.380 --> 15:33.000]  I think it's bigger than you two think.
[15:33.360 --> 15:34.140]  I think so.
[15:39.620 --> 15:44.080]  Just reminds me, was it... was it Bernie or Gus or someone said that they
[15:45.120 --> 15:47.020]  could fit their cock through a toilet roll?
[15:47.140 --> 15:47.540]  That was Bernie.
[15:49.200 --> 15:50.640]  Was it that he could or couldn't?
[15:50.640 --> 15:55.040]  He thought he couldn't, but he could. Or he could, but he couldn't. I don't remember.
[15:55.400 --> 15:57.400]  I don't think about his dick that much anymore, but...
[15:57.400 --> 15:57.840]  No, me neither.
[15:58.800 --> 15:59.480]  Apparently you do.
[16:00.200 --> 16:02.540]  I don't think either of you could do the hot dog in the nest.
[16:03.160 --> 16:04.340]  No, there's no way.
[16:04.700 --> 16:06.820]  Here, hold on. Hold on. I'm gonna send you guys a fucking photo.
[16:07.140 --> 16:09.520]  And if I can, Gavin definitely can.
[16:09.760 --> 16:13.880]  Even if you lubed it up with hot dog material, like some ketchup or some mustard,
[16:14.060 --> 16:15.040]  it ain't... it ain't going in there.
[16:15.240 --> 16:15.740]  Why do you think that?
[16:15.960 --> 16:17.520]  No way. That's way too small.
[16:18.960 --> 16:21.420]  That's like hot dog size and that's not even stretching.
[16:21.780 --> 16:22.960]  That's just naturally open.
[16:23.300 --> 16:24.660]  I mean, that looks like stretching.
[16:25.000 --> 16:26.560]  That doesn't just look naturally.
[16:26.680 --> 16:28.180]  That doesn't look like a relaxed photo.
[16:28.180 --> 16:29.940]  Yeah, but that's not like external manipulation.
[16:30.120 --> 16:33.700]  If I get my... if I get my fucking hands in there and start opening stuff up, you could...
[16:33.700 --> 16:34.900]  Oh my god.
[16:36.520 --> 16:39.440]  And Gavin's got... he's so much more naturally capable.
[16:39.680 --> 16:40.880]  I'm gonna try and take a picture of my nose.
[16:41.020 --> 16:41.380]  I don't...
[16:44.020 --> 16:45.720]  This is... you guys can't do this.
[16:45.820 --> 16:47.440]  This isn't... it's not going to work.
[16:47.640 --> 16:48.320]  But I want to see it.
[16:48.380 --> 16:51.320]  Well, maybe we'll try it on the same day we do Patagal.
[16:52.160 --> 16:53.300]  Do they need to be cooked?
[16:53.400 --> 16:56.580]  Is there a... like a thing sanitary wise?
[16:56.960 --> 16:58.900]  Are you okay with a raw dog in your nose?
[16:59.140 --> 17:00.460]  Yeah, I mean, they come cooked.
[17:00.520 --> 17:01.200]  They're cooked already.
[17:01.740 --> 17:02.060]  Yeah.
[17:03.480 --> 17:05.180]  You're just heating it up when you're...
[17:05.180 --> 17:08.040]  Yeah, I'll probably try and get it to body... like room temperature.
[17:08.280 --> 17:10.520]  I don't want to shock the nostril and have it contract.
[17:11.040 --> 17:13.540]  Have you guys played the Indiana Jones game?
[17:14.000 --> 17:14.160]  No.
[17:14.560 --> 17:15.460]  That has a lot of food in it.
[17:15.500 --> 17:16.540]  All right, you guys need to play it.
[17:16.600 --> 17:17.080]  It's really good.
[17:17.480 --> 17:18.880]  I'm not a big Indiana Jones guy.
[17:19.020 --> 17:20.720]  I became obsessed with that game.
[17:21.020 --> 17:21.780]  It is so much fun.
[17:21.820 --> 17:22.000]  Really?
[17:22.280 --> 17:22.520]  Oh.
[17:22.700 --> 17:24.860]  I thought Greg Miller gave it a pretty middling review.
[17:25.040 --> 17:26.320]  Yeah, he said it was like a six or something.
[17:26.320 --> 17:27.960]  Yeah, crazy.
[17:28.320 --> 17:29.180]  It's such a good game.
[17:29.480 --> 17:31.160]  The physics in it are ridiculous.
[17:31.740 --> 17:36.820]  It's so much fun to get into fights with the Nazis and the fascists and just hitting people.
[17:37.320 --> 17:38.640]  Like everything is a weapon.
[17:38.840 --> 17:42.540]  There's so many things are so you could grab like a skillet with bacon in it and eggs
[17:42.540 --> 17:44.300]  and just start hitting people with it.
[17:44.560 --> 17:46.040]  It is great.
[17:46.920 --> 17:47.900]  Do you have all these?
[17:48.020 --> 17:51.280]  I was thinking about like food and stuff because there's so much food in that game that you can eat
[17:51.280 --> 17:54.280]  and like boost your stamina, but you can also just throw it if you want to.
[17:55.260 --> 17:55.980]  Oh, fantastic.
[17:55.980 --> 17:58.080]  Can you stuff a sausage up a Nazi nose?
[17:58.440 --> 18:00.260]  Ah, no sausages, unfortunately.
[18:00.500 --> 18:01.580]  Can you throw bacon?
[18:01.840 --> 18:06.200]  Bacon you can't, but it like sticks in the skillet when you swing it.
[18:06.220 --> 18:08.420]  So like it stays there as you're hitting them.
[18:08.460 --> 18:09.320]  It's fantastic.
[18:09.600 --> 18:11.560]  Does he say lots of fun one liners?
[18:11.620 --> 18:12.920]  Does it sound like Harrison Ford?
[18:13.220 --> 18:15.700]  Oh, Troy Baker does such an insane job.
[18:16.020 --> 18:16.740]  He's so good.
[18:16.880 --> 18:17.360]  He's pretty good.
[18:17.520 --> 18:18.040]  Harrison Ford.
[18:18.440 --> 18:20.200]  He just so yeah, he killed it.
[18:20.580 --> 18:22.000]  No, there's not a lot of one liners.
[18:22.260 --> 18:24.220]  Did you see the interview where he talked about
[18:24.220 --> 18:27.840]  like Todd Howard told him that like you will not be the voice of Indiana Jones?
[18:28.040 --> 18:29.080]  Did you did you hear about that?
[18:29.140 --> 18:32.720]  No, I saw that there's like headline where he was like he really didn't want him to be.
[18:32.900 --> 18:33.420]  He did.
[18:33.520 --> 18:36.200]  He told him that you won't be the voice of Indiana Jones.
[18:36.380 --> 18:38.720]  So he auditioned for it and then got picked.
[18:38.860 --> 18:42.620]  And then it got down to a blind listening of three people.
[18:42.620 --> 18:45.100]  And every single person picked Troy Baker.
[18:45.500 --> 18:48.980]  And Todd Howard told him, everyone picked you.
[18:49.160 --> 18:51.260]  So you will be Indiana Jones.
[18:51.940 --> 18:52.640]  He does great.
[18:52.640 --> 18:57.820]  I fell in love with that game because it's like a very kind of physics world.
[18:57.820 --> 19:01.320]  And the ragdolls are dumb where you can charge up your punch.
[19:01.380 --> 19:03.480]  You can do like a Falcon Indiana Jones punch.
[19:03.780 --> 19:05.400]  And I was sneaking up.
[19:05.600 --> 19:06.760]  You can you can walk up.
[19:06.840 --> 19:11.000]  And if you hit like an enemy without them noticing you, you do more damage.
[19:11.300 --> 19:16.620]  So it was this Nazi sitting at a table and then two Nazis in front of the table,
[19:16.820 --> 19:20.340]  like probably like five, six feet away, looking the other direction.
[19:20.440 --> 19:22.160]  Like none of them are sneaking up on all of them.
[19:22.640 --> 19:26.140]  And I charged up my fist and I hit the Nazi in the back of the head.
[19:26.300 --> 19:28.880]  And just the physics like this wasn't a scripted event.
[19:29.040 --> 19:30.480]  I hit him so hard.
[19:30.560 --> 19:35.120]  His head went into the table and the table cracked in half just from the impact of it.
[19:35.180 --> 19:38.740]  And then that made a noise which alerted the two Nazis in front of them.
[19:38.900 --> 19:40.860]  And they turned around like, what the fuck was that?
[19:41.080 --> 19:43.720]  And just see this table cracked in half and the knocked out guy.
[19:43.840 --> 19:46.000]  And then it escalating into a brawl.
[19:46.420 --> 19:47.240]  So much fun.
[19:47.520 --> 19:48.520]  I laughed so hard.
[19:48.580 --> 19:49.100]  Did you clip it?
[19:49.300 --> 19:50.000]  I didn't clip it.
[19:50.060 --> 19:50.880]  I should have clipped it.
[19:50.880 --> 19:54.680]  But I was just so... it was so unexpected to punch a dude so hard.
[19:54.760 --> 19:56.260]  I've never hit someone so hard in a game.
[19:56.580 --> 19:57.560]  They went through a table.
[19:57.800 --> 19:59.180]  It just felt so good.
[19:59.380 --> 20:01.840]  We should watch you stream it on one of the stream days.
[20:02.100 --> 20:02.560]  That'd be fun.
[20:02.900 --> 20:03.640]  Comment over it.
[20:03.760 --> 20:06.580]  I'd love to see... yeah, I finished it, unfortunately.
[20:07.240 --> 20:09.220]  But I would love to see one of you guys.
[20:09.380 --> 20:10.940]  Yeah, like watch Nick play it or something.
[20:11.060 --> 20:11.580]  Or Gavin, yeah.
[20:11.720 --> 20:14.500]  As somebody who doesn't care about Indiana Jones at all,
[20:14.560 --> 20:16.640]  it has me wanting to watch all of those movies.
[20:16.980 --> 20:18.960]  Because I haven't seen, I don't think, any of the good ones.
[20:18.960 --> 20:20.660]  First three are fantastic.
[20:20.920 --> 20:26.000]  I've seen Crystal Skull and the Temple one.
[20:26.560 --> 20:27.480]  The second one, I think.
[20:27.880 --> 20:28.640]  Temple of Doom.
[20:29.820 --> 20:29.980]  Yeah.
[20:30.180 --> 20:30.740]  Smoothie sucks.
[20:31.120 --> 20:31.460]  What's that?
[20:31.860 --> 20:32.540]  Temple of Doom sucks.
[20:32.840 --> 20:34.240]  It doesn't suck. It's just not great.
[20:34.440 --> 20:35.740]  I feel like people don't like Temple of Doom.
[20:35.940 --> 20:37.540]  It's still better than the new shit.
[20:37.660 --> 20:39.220]  It's still worth watching.
[20:39.660 --> 20:41.480]  Kali Ma and all that stuff's fucking great.
[20:41.620 --> 20:42.180]  I like 1 and 3.
[20:42.480 --> 20:42.660]  Yeah.
[20:42.900 --> 20:43.460]  1 and 3.
[20:43.660 --> 20:46.140]  I'd go 1, 3, 2, and then no point in the others.
[20:46.720 --> 20:47.360]  Yeah, I agree.
[20:47.360 --> 20:49.880]  I was about to ask, is the most recent one worth watching?
[20:50.240 --> 20:51.520]  The only one I have access to.
[20:51.800 --> 20:53.860]  The Dial of Destiny, I think it's called.
[20:54.000 --> 20:54.660]  That's what it's called, yeah.
[20:54.880 --> 20:56.840]  That property doesn't feel like it hits the same,
[20:56.900 --> 20:59.640]  but I'm really hoping that the game adds some life to it.
[20:59.720 --> 21:01.480]  It's incredible what they did with that game.
[21:01.940 --> 21:03.760]  It's so much fun to just run around and throw shit.
[21:03.960 --> 21:06.000]  I mean, I know it's incredibly old at this point,
[21:06.020 --> 21:11.640]  but I can't imagine Raiders of the Lost Ark not being phenomenal on a first watch, you know?
[21:11.680 --> 21:14.260]  I imagine you'll absolutely love it.
[21:14.260 --> 21:18.340]  I've seen the beginning of it and it was funny watching the beginning,
[21:18.840 --> 21:22.800]  knowing who Alfred Molina is, but not knowing the movie and being like,
[21:22.880 --> 21:24.780]  oh, he's in this, he's going to be around a while.
[21:25.240 --> 21:27.220]  And he has essentially no role and dies immediately.
[21:27.880 --> 21:29.620]  He gets the spike through his head, doesn't he?
[21:29.720 --> 21:30.420]  Yeah, he does.
[21:30.780 --> 21:31.040]  Yeah.
[21:31.240 --> 21:33.400]  It's surprisingly gruesome for like a PG movie.
[21:33.540 --> 21:33.840]  Yeah.
[21:34.020 --> 21:34.520]  Is it PG?
[21:34.780 --> 21:34.940]  Yeah.
[21:35.220 --> 21:35.620]  Interesting.
[21:35.840 --> 21:37.540]  That was the 80s, man. You could be gruesome.
[21:37.800 --> 21:37.940]  Yeah.
[21:38.200 --> 21:40.880]  I don't think PG-13 had been invented yet, had it?
[21:41.040 --> 21:41.580]  I assume not.
[21:41.920 --> 21:43.660]  What was the first PG-13 movie?
[21:43.660 --> 21:45.200]  I feel like we've talked about this before.
[21:45.480 --> 21:46.040]  I think we have.
[21:47.400 --> 21:51.420]  First PG-13 movie is Red Dawn.
[21:51.580 --> 21:51.900]  Yeah.
[21:52.260 --> 21:53.340]  December of 1984.
[21:53.740 --> 21:54.140]  Red Dawn.
[21:54.540 --> 21:55.680]  I haven't seen that.
[21:55.820 --> 21:58.600]  You know when dudes are about to fight sometimes and they,
[21:58.600 --> 22:01.680]  they just like square up on each other and they get real close.
[22:01.740 --> 22:03.740]  It looks like they're like close enough to kiss each other.
[22:03.980 --> 22:04.240]  Yes.
[22:04.320 --> 22:05.360]  Where does that come from?
[22:05.700 --> 22:10.960]  Are people doing that because they've seen it in films or is it just a leftover piece of
[22:10.960 --> 22:13.900]  natural instinct from like animal behavior?
[22:14.300 --> 22:16.580]  I think it's genetic. I think it's natural instinct. Yeah.
[22:16.620 --> 22:16.880]  Yeah.
[22:17.020 --> 22:20.380]  It's weird to see. It's weird to see that it's real and it happens in real life because I've
[22:20.380 --> 22:20.840]  never done it.
[22:20.980 --> 22:24.360]  Well, like the stare down, like the hold me back kind of like pre-fight.
[22:24.400 --> 22:24.580]  Yeah.
[22:24.600 --> 22:24.980]  Is that what you're saying?
[22:25.200 --> 22:29.440]  Getting right, like an inch away from someone's face and like talking at them and that.
[22:29.560 --> 22:31.240]  Yeah. That's an interesting question of,
[22:31.580 --> 22:36.300]  because like obviously that's such a thing in competitive fighting, the stare down.
[22:36.760 --> 22:39.480]  But was the stare down the catalyst to that or was,
[22:39.480 --> 22:41.520]  was it just, do you understand what I'm saying?
[22:41.800 --> 22:45.780]  Like, was it natural? Like, is it, is it in our past to want to do that?
[22:45.980 --> 22:49.560]  Like, is that impressive? Because it is something in our DNA from the past.
[22:49.860 --> 22:53.840]  Well, like animals front on each other like that. And before they headbutt and all that.
[22:54.080 --> 22:54.620]  That's true.
[22:55.820 --> 22:56.680]  That's a good point.
[22:57.320 --> 22:58.600]  People just get so close.
[22:59.580 --> 23:01.780]  Like, yeah, gorillas posture up too.
[23:02.620 --> 23:06.920]  And it's like, I don't know how true this is, but I read somewhere on the internet years ago
[23:06.920 --> 23:13.460]  that like the reason we find people tripping and falling funny is because evolutionarily,
[23:13.620 --> 23:17.360]  it like releases an endorphin of relief because evolutionarily,
[23:17.360 --> 23:19.440]  when we were all like running from saber-toothed tigers,
[23:19.720 --> 23:22.060]  if somebody tripped and fell, that meant you were safe.
[23:29.220 --> 23:33.240]  But other stuff that couldn't have been anywhere near animal related is still funny.
[23:33.400 --> 23:36.440]  It's true. It's true. Who knows if that's true? It's just a funny thing to think about.
[23:36.440 --> 23:42.160]  I must really enjoy feeling safe because I will just search person falling.
[23:42.600 --> 23:46.780]  I'd like to know what the caveman version of a guy getting hit in the balls with a
[23:46.780 --> 23:50.900]  skateboard or a football is because that's my sweet spot.
[23:52.180 --> 23:58.020]  Oh, I saw a great one of a woman that was like leaning out of a train for like an artistic
[23:58.680 --> 24:02.020]  video, like a shot, and then she got hit by a tree, like a branch.
[24:02.160 --> 24:05.640]  I watched it 50 times this morning, dude.
[24:05.640 --> 24:07.280]  She lived? Oh, yeah.
[24:07.700 --> 24:09.660]  Unclear. Oh, I'm assuming.
[24:11.640 --> 24:13.740]  I'm sure she's fine. Do you have the clip?
[24:14.000 --> 24:17.100]  I'm not at the ready, but yeah, I think I sent it to Emily.
[24:17.180 --> 24:18.020]  I'll look for it and send it to you.
[24:18.160 --> 24:20.640]  I mean, anyone falling is great whenever there's a new fall.
[24:20.820 --> 24:24.940]  Was it Olivia Rodrigo that had that great fall recently where she just fell on the stage?
[24:25.500 --> 24:27.440]  Did you see that one, Gavin? I don't think so.
[24:27.780 --> 24:31.600]  There's like a stage door still open and she was like walking on,
[24:31.700 --> 24:34.420]  like she was singing and walking and just fell into the hole.
[24:34.420 --> 24:35.700]  Hard down.
[24:35.840 --> 24:36.700]  Who left the hole open?
[24:36.940 --> 24:37.960]  Somebody who used to work there.
[24:39.140 --> 24:40.660]  Josh Hartnett had to try to escape.
[24:40.860 --> 24:41.660]  It was a whole trap thing.
[24:41.720 --> 24:42.120]  He's a killer.
[24:42.760 --> 24:45.640]  That movie bums me out, I think, more than any movie I've seen this year.
[24:45.820 --> 24:46.540]  It's upsetting.
[24:46.720 --> 24:47.420]  I still haven't seen it.
[24:47.600 --> 24:49.300]  Finally, somebody else agrees.
[24:49.820 --> 24:50.760]  I've always agreed.
[24:51.020 --> 24:55.360]  Like number one with a bullet on most disappointing movie of the year.
[24:55.480 --> 25:00.880]  Now that it's on like a rentable platform, I get clips of it on TikTok occasionally,
[25:00.880 --> 25:04.240]  and it's all the scenes before that movie goes bad.
[25:04.520 --> 25:07.360]  And it is so disappointing to be like, oh, this is...
[25:07.360 --> 25:11.240]  I remember watching this movie in the moment and not realizing how bad it was going to be.
[25:11.520 --> 25:13.440]  Really enjoying it at this stage.
[25:13.800 --> 25:15.160]  Oh, such a waste.
[25:15.540 --> 25:16.280]  What a dumb...
[25:16.860 --> 25:18.700]  That movie fucking sucks, ultimately.
[25:19.040 --> 25:20.160]  I guess I'm just never going to know.
[25:20.400 --> 25:21.480]  Like with most of his films.
[25:21.760 --> 25:22.250]  You should see...
[25:22.920 --> 25:23.640]  Nah, I'm good.
[25:23.860 --> 25:24.440]  So good.
[25:24.780 --> 25:25.440]  And then it's not.
[25:25.820 --> 25:27.480]  It might be the movie that hits the highest.
[25:27.660 --> 25:29.580]  Talking about ranges, Bagel Ranges.
[25:30.160 --> 25:33.100]  That movie, I think, hits like an eight and ends up at a two.
[25:33.420 --> 25:33.780]  Oh, wow.
[25:33.880 --> 25:34.800]  That's a big swing.
[25:35.080 --> 25:37.180]  Yeah, I mean, that's definitely how it feels too.
[25:37.680 --> 25:39.660]  Like, and there's a moment where it happens and it's very sad.
[25:39.880 --> 25:41.760]  Does he escape in a spaceship or something?
[25:42.080 --> 25:43.460]  That would be cooler than what happens.
[25:43.460 --> 25:44.180]  That would be so awesome.
[25:44.400 --> 25:46.700]  Oh my God, that would be fucking rad compared to what happens.
[25:49.820 --> 25:53.540]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[25:53.900 --> 25:56.780]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[25:56.780 --> 26:00.460]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[26:00.860 --> 26:02.380]  Available for a limited time.
[26:02.600 --> 26:04.640]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[26:05.680 --> 26:08.380]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm.
[26:08.680 --> 26:12.040]  Checking off the boxes on your to-do list is a great feeling.

[26:25.880 --> 26:28.140]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[26:30.960 --> 26:33.980]  I've been thinking about getting into Sarsaparilla.
[26:34.980 --> 26:35.340]  Sarsaparilla?
[26:35.560 --> 26:39.060]  Yeah, I had some up when I was in Branson, and I've been thinking about it.
[26:39.360 --> 26:41.460]  I can't get it here, I don't see it anywhere.
[26:41.540 --> 26:44.140]  I went to World Market, figured they definitely have it, they don't have shit.
[26:44.980 --> 26:47.420]  And now, because I can't find it, I want it a lot.
[26:47.620 --> 26:47.840]  And I think I want it a lot.
[26:47.840 --> 26:48.280]  Was it a drink?
[26:48.940 --> 26:50.060]  Yeah, it's kind of like root beer.
[26:50.540 --> 26:51.460]  It's essentially root beer.
[26:51.560 --> 26:54.460]  I don't know that it's different in any way than root beer.
[26:54.460 --> 26:57.560]  Yeah, it is like, I think it's root beer, it's just like a different
[26:57.560 --> 26:59.540]  root, like a slightly different root.
[26:59.820 --> 27:01.200]  I think that's all it is.
[27:01.340 --> 27:02.920]  But it's fun to say, Sarsaparilla.
[27:03.580 --> 27:08.220]  And the brand I had was Sioux City Sarsaparilla, which is even more fun to say.
[27:08.480 --> 27:11.240]  You know, three hard S's, it's pretty good.
[27:11.340 --> 27:14.960]  And so I want to get some, if anybody knows where I can get some Sioux City Sarsaparilla
[27:14.960 --> 27:17.620]  in Austin, around these parts, you let me know, Cowpoke.
[27:19.900 --> 27:23.500]  That's what you drink in Fallout New Vegas, is Sunset Sarsaparilla.
[27:23.500 --> 27:24.600]  And I always thought that was cool.
[27:24.720 --> 27:25.820]  Yeah, I don't remember that.
[27:25.960 --> 27:26.180]  That's cool.
[27:26.420 --> 27:27.680]  I want to play New Vegas again.
[27:27.680 --> 27:28.400]  Oh, New Vegas.
[27:28.620 --> 27:29.440]  That's the best one.
[27:29.460 --> 27:30.460]  It's just the best one.
[27:30.660 --> 27:31.700]  It's the best one.
[27:31.720 --> 27:32.900]  It's because it's the only one they didn't make.
[27:33.640 --> 27:34.360]  Hey, honestly.
[27:34.520 --> 27:34.780]  Yeah.
[27:35.580 --> 27:36.220]  Thanks, Obsidian.
[27:36.680 --> 27:36.960]  Yep.
[27:37.380 --> 27:41.440]  I found a place where you can order it, but it's just online.
[27:41.560 --> 27:42.020]  Sorry, Jeff.
[27:42.140 --> 27:46.940]  It's not the same, you know, you want to hit your horse up to a post and saddle on
[27:46.940 --> 27:49.160]  in and order a fresh one right off the tap.
[27:50.120 --> 27:54.000]  Oh, if you could install a tap in your house that could dispense any drink, what would it
[27:54.000 --> 27:54.840]  be in your house?
[27:55.100 --> 27:56.160]  Well, today it'd be Sarsaparilla.
[27:57.500 --> 27:58.820]  Probably cold brew coffee.
[28:00.940 --> 28:03.740]  You would drink way too much of that if it came out of a tap.
[28:04.000 --> 28:07.500]  It would be such an issue for my day to day life.
[28:07.620 --> 28:10.500]  But boy, what a ride those two weeks would be.
[28:13.520 --> 28:18.520]  Yeah, I feel like the effort involved in coffee keeps people from ODing on caffeine.
[28:18.520 --> 28:19.240]  Oh, absolutely.
[28:19.420 --> 28:22.800]  I've had two cups today and I want to make another one, but we're not going to have time
[28:22.800 --> 28:26.020]  in between stuff because it just takes a little too long.
[28:26.280 --> 28:27.200]  How long does it take?
[28:27.380 --> 28:28.020]  I can give you time.
[28:28.400 --> 28:30.520]  Oh, no, no, no, because I'm just curious.
[28:30.780 --> 28:31.460]  I don't want the time.
[28:31.460 --> 28:32.140]  No, I understand that.
[28:32.160 --> 28:33.680]  I'm just curious about how long it takes.
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.380]  Uh, to like heat the water and everything.
[28:35.480 --> 28:37.920]  I just need like 10 minutes to like feel comfortable making it.
[28:38.320 --> 28:42.640]  Well, I'm going to need about 15 minutes to take the dog out to go to the bathroom because
[28:42.640 --> 28:44.400]  he's going to need to pee after two podcasts.
[28:44.640 --> 28:46.760]  So, uh, do what you will with that time.
[28:46.760 --> 28:52.080]  It's just, uh, it's that thing where it's just, just the amount of time is like, oh,
[28:52.120 --> 28:52.400]  maybe.
[28:52.780 --> 28:54.140]  But boy, I'm almost out of beans.
[28:54.260 --> 28:54.780]  It's a whole thing.
[28:54.980 --> 28:55.640]  It's just a whole thing.
[28:55.960 --> 28:56.920]  What about Nick and Andrew?
[28:57.080 --> 28:58.000]  What would be in your taps?
[28:58.200 --> 28:59.800]  I think I know myself too well.
[29:00.300 --> 29:04.240]  It would be, as Eric said, a problem to have like a soda or something.
[29:04.300 --> 29:06.160]  I think I'd just go with like a sparkling water.
[29:06.480 --> 29:08.740]  Maybe like an orange bubble.
[29:10.000 --> 29:10.640]  Diet Pepsi.
[29:11.480 --> 29:12.200]  Oh, man.
[29:12.500 --> 29:15.140]  I almost like similar to Eric's, the cold brew coffee.
[29:15.140 --> 29:20.000]  But I think I would go with something that's more of like, would I go with a dark beer?
[29:20.280 --> 29:21.160]  This is great.
[29:21.280 --> 29:25.580]  We're all playing pretend and Nick is treating it like he has to make a decision for what's
[29:25.580 --> 29:26.340]  about to go in his home.
[29:26.340 --> 29:27.400]  I appreciate that, though.
[29:27.420 --> 29:29.680]  I'm glad he's not just shitting out a meaningless answer.
[29:30.120 --> 29:31.340]  Thanks for really caring.
[29:31.820 --> 29:36.740]  To be clear, you're installing this in your house and you can't change it and it's permanently
[29:36.740 --> 29:37.160]  there.
[29:38.340 --> 29:43.380]  So then if you're going to sell your home at some point, you need to factor in that
[29:43.380 --> 29:44.680]  this is part of your house.
[29:45.300 --> 29:45.700]  Yes.
[29:48.020 --> 29:49.480]  That's a selling point.
[29:49.620 --> 29:51.880]  You know how many people were interested in that stupid pizza oven?
[29:51.980 --> 29:53.100]  This is the same thing.
[29:55.080 --> 29:57.940]  Oh, people liked your house because of the pizza place?
[29:58.280 --> 29:58.880]  Yeah, dude.
[29:59.040 --> 29:59.740]  That was a fucking...
[29:59.740 --> 30:00.660]  I heard about it a bunch.
[30:00.960 --> 30:01.300]  Yeah, see?
[30:01.420 --> 30:02.860]  You totally shouldn't have demolished it.
[30:03.160 --> 30:04.040]  Well, I didn't, did I?
[30:04.300 --> 30:04.720]  I sold it.
[30:06.980 --> 30:13.220]  Instead of a pizza oven, it's got a, you know, open floor plan, high ceilings, sarsaparilla
[30:13.220 --> 30:13.800]  tap.
[30:16.860 --> 30:18.680]  What do you lead with, sarsaparilla tap?
[30:19.760 --> 30:24.280]  sarsaparilla tap, two bedroom, three bathroom, four tap.
[30:24.500 --> 30:27.060]  The upstairs sarsaparilla tap is the real Rari.
[30:27.380 --> 30:32.660]  This is a funny thing, but we saw the TV show Hacks and in the TV show Hacks, the main character
[30:32.660 --> 30:37.100]  has a soda machine in her house like you had at the, like a McDonald's, you know, like
[30:37.100 --> 30:37.500]  a full one.
[30:37.780 --> 30:43.800]  And Emily, once she saw that that's an option, has, it is number one on her list of when
[30:43.800 --> 30:47.360]  we buy the Michigan house that's going to have a basement in it, because all Michigan
[30:47.360 --> 30:48.100]  homes have basements.
[30:48.280 --> 30:51.260]  The first thing she's installing, she's already looked into it.
[30:51.320 --> 30:52.460]  They're, they're affordable.
[30:52.780 --> 30:54.300]  She's found companies that do it.
[30:54.600 --> 30:57.300]  She's installing a soda thing in our basement.
[30:57.540 --> 31:01.580]  Could you just, if you had, I mean, obviously, if you have the money, you can, enough money,
[31:01.620 --> 31:02.240]  you could do whatever.
[31:02.820 --> 31:05.680]  But how accessible is a Coke Freestyle machine?
[31:06.280 --> 31:07.900]  That's a great question.
[31:08.140 --> 31:10.960]  You have to have like a business license to have one?
[31:11.080 --> 31:12.260]  Like, do you have to be an establishment?
[31:12.260 --> 31:16.000]  Can you just recreationally buy a Freestyle machine?
[31:16.180 --> 31:17.480]  But like, why the Freestyle?
[31:17.640 --> 31:19.800]  Jeff only wants Diet Coke.
[31:19.940 --> 31:20.600]  You know what I mean?
[31:20.900 --> 31:23.760]  It's just, it's the jukebox of the soda world.
[31:24.240 --> 31:26.080]  I like having the variety of choices.
[31:26.220 --> 31:26.580]  How's it work?
[31:26.640 --> 31:28.720]  Is it like a guy come by and just fill it up with syrups?
[31:29.000 --> 31:29.400]  Yeah.
[31:29.660 --> 31:30.680]  Or you can buy your own syrup.
[31:30.980 --> 31:31.780]  You probably do it yourself.
[31:32.100 --> 31:34.260]  They have smaller countertop units for 21k.
[31:34.520 --> 31:34.920]  Jesus.
[31:35.200 --> 31:35.600]  Jesus.
[31:36.480 --> 31:37.820]  That is expensive.
[31:38.140 --> 31:39.460]  Man, that's why you don't see them very often.
[31:40.520 --> 31:43.780]  Why don't they have them just in the, in the street?
[31:44.980 --> 31:46.080]  A vending machine?
[31:46.240 --> 31:47.020]  Are you at what?
[31:47.240 --> 31:50.840]  Nah, like, you know how there's like public water fountains just out.
[31:51.260 --> 31:53.800]  Why doesn't every road just have...
[31:53.800 --> 31:54.780]  Like a 7up fountain?
[31:55.060 --> 31:55.360]  Yeah.
[31:55.640 --> 31:57.140]  You just pick what you want and go up to it.
[31:57.340 --> 31:58.800]  And it's just like all the houses share it.
[31:58.880 --> 31:59.460]  Who pays for it?
[31:59.740 --> 31:59.900]  I don't know.
[31:59.920 --> 32:01.360]  Who pays for a power pole?
[32:02.540 --> 32:07.440]  So you want the Coke Freestyle machine to come out of our taxes?
[32:10.900 --> 32:12.640]  Well, that'd be neat.
[32:12.820 --> 32:13.820]  You don't need one in your house.
[32:14.300 --> 32:15.520]  You just walk outside.
[32:15.700 --> 32:16.500]  You don't have to take a little stroll.
[32:16.580 --> 32:20.960]  Yeah, you walk outside, you shave, and then you go get your 7up.
[32:22.880 --> 32:24.220]  You go to the communal shave.
[32:24.260 --> 32:30.800]  Fill up your neighborhood beard box and then get a bucket of Diet Pepsi.
[32:31.540 --> 32:34.820]  I don't know, there's so much stuff that could so easily be shared.
[32:35.000 --> 32:36.040]  It's like the town well.
[32:39.100 --> 32:40.620]  Oh no, watch out, Timmy.
[32:42.080 --> 32:43.680]  Timmy fell in the mountain do well.
[32:44.100 --> 32:46.800]  Gavin just discovered hippie communes and he's all about it.
[32:47.180 --> 32:47.340]  Yep.
[32:49.300 --> 32:52.380]  But if it was treated well, I think it'd be fine.
[32:52.600 --> 32:53.440]  Isn't that most things?
[32:53.660 --> 32:56.280]  It do. Guys, listen, if nothing happened to it, nothing would happen to it.
[32:56.400 --> 32:56.640]  It's great.
[32:56.760 --> 32:56.900]  Yeah.
[32:57.380 --> 32:58.440]  If it was treated well.
[32:58.660 --> 32:59.480]  Put it next to a mailbox.
[32:59.860 --> 33:03.380]  That's just the equivalent of would be good if done right.
[33:03.620 --> 33:05.200]  It's like, well, yeah, why would you do it wrong?
[33:06.320 --> 33:09.240]  A soda well would be a problem because the carbonation, right?
[33:09.520 --> 33:11.540]  You need to have something constantly carbonating it.
[33:11.560 --> 33:14.360]  It'd be like a giant soda stream that was constantly like
[33:15.780 --> 33:17.240]  at regular intervals at the bottom.
[33:17.380 --> 33:19.660]  Yeah, I feel like most of the unit would be a CO2 canister.
[33:20.520 --> 33:24.400]  While digging my well, I accidentally nicked a CO2 pipe.
[33:27.440 --> 33:29.540]  I want to start. I think we should start one.
[33:29.680 --> 33:31.600]  All we need to do is weatherproof one of these machines.
[33:32.060 --> 33:33.620]  Dude, that'd be the fucking worst.
[33:33.620 --> 33:36.700]  You dig it in your backyard and you don't call the city first and you
[33:36.700 --> 33:40.520]  nick the fucking soda line and you end up putting mud in everybody's soda line.
[33:40.980 --> 33:43.820]  And then everybody in the fucking town hates you because you got to flush it out.
[33:44.900 --> 33:46.560]  Why is my mud all bubbly?
[33:47.880 --> 33:48.760]  You just see someone...
[33:48.760 --> 33:49.240]  Carbonated mud.
[33:49.940 --> 33:53.900]  You just see someone leant over on their front lawn looking like Mr. Freeze has just got
[33:54.310 --> 33:55.860]  to nick the CO2 line.
[33:56.380 --> 33:58.740]  In Austin, in Austin fucking Texas,
[33:58.980 --> 34:03.000]  it would work for two years and then you'd be like, why does it taste like this?
[34:03.000 --> 34:06.420]  They'd be like, oh, yeah, there's zebra mollusks in the Pepsi again.
[34:06.620 --> 34:08.060]  We can't get rid of them.
[34:08.420 --> 34:11.420]  It'll be like this every three years forever until it gets worse.
[34:12.660 --> 34:14.620]  I hate the idea of a soda well.
[34:14.800 --> 34:19.780]  If you're not from Austin, we have these things called zebra mollusks that they literally cannot
[34:19.780 --> 34:25.040]  remove for some reason, and they just make our water taste like fish for like three weeks.
[34:25.060 --> 34:27.340]  And you got to boil it for like, I don't know, every couple of years.
[34:27.580 --> 34:29.640]  I just you should just do that anyway with the Austin water.
[34:29.840 --> 34:31.540]  Yeah, well, Austin water is not good.
[34:31.720 --> 34:32.480]  Rancid stuff.
[34:32.480 --> 34:34.170]  Terrible piece of shit.
[34:35.600 --> 34:37.120]  Ain't no soda well.
[34:37.660 --> 34:40.560]  Say that well, let's let's register that company.
[34:40.700 --> 34:41.660]  I think it'll be big.
[34:42.280 --> 34:44.620]  Somebody spiked the soda well with root beer.
[34:44.920 --> 34:46.180]  This fucking sucks.
[34:47.180 --> 34:49.300]  Just put one at the back of every cul-de-sac.
[34:49.700 --> 34:50.960]  Are you a neighbors guy, Gavin?
[34:51.040 --> 34:53.880]  Do you like knowing your neighbors, like interacting with your neighbors?
[34:54.320 --> 34:55.500]  Uh, no.
[34:56.300 --> 34:58.520]  And this seems like a terrible thing to lead.
[34:58.800 --> 35:00.500]  Well, soda well for everybody.
[35:00.840 --> 35:01.620]  The communal well.
[35:01.620 --> 35:03.660]  Maybe it would help me get involved in the community.
[35:03.900 --> 35:04.380]  Wow.
[35:04.660 --> 35:07.220]  Are you just trying to figure out who the cucumber lady is?
[35:07.340 --> 35:08.380]  Are you trying to track her down?
[35:09.140 --> 35:13.400]  Maybe this will get me involved in the community.
[35:19.100 --> 35:22.840]  I sat idly by until the soda well.
[35:23.820 --> 35:26.480]  And I realized it's time for me to make a change.
[35:26.820 --> 35:29.640]  This this reminds me of a conversation I had with Emily recently,
[35:29.640 --> 35:34.680]  where I drove through my old neighborhood where I sold the house that I had lived at for six years.
[35:35.500 --> 35:37.540]  And I felt kind of sad.
[35:37.740 --> 35:40.960]  I hadn't experienced this before, but I felt kind of sad because there was like
[35:40.960 --> 35:44.200]  nobody to wave at or no like neighbor friends.
[35:44.340 --> 35:48.720]  And I realized that when we moved, I didn't say goodbye to a single neighbor
[35:48.720 --> 35:50.860]  and a single neighbor didn't say goodbye to me.
[35:51.020 --> 35:52.260]  And I was telling Emily about it.
[35:52.260 --> 35:55.140]  And I was like, I just feel kind of like we lived there for six years and
[35:55.680 --> 36:00.240]  didn't really leave a mark or matter or know anybody or make any kind of an imprint.
[36:00.400 --> 36:03.340]  So when you leave, it feels like you were never there, you know,
[36:03.400 --> 36:04.540]  and it just kind of bums me out.
[36:04.560 --> 36:07.520]  And she was like, well, maybe you should make an effort with our current neighbors then.
[36:07.620 --> 36:09.680]  And I was like, what the fuck are you thinking?
[36:09.860 --> 36:10.660]  Oh, my God.
[36:10.960 --> 36:14.140]  And then I realized how much I don't care about that other thing,
[36:14.140 --> 36:16.000]  because it would mean I'd have to talk to people.
[36:17.980 --> 36:21.420]  Reminds me of when I think if you if you could get in and out without leaving a mark,
[36:21.440 --> 36:22.140]  I think you've done it right.
[36:22.140 --> 36:25.160]  Yeah, man. I don't know most of the name.
[36:25.440 --> 36:28.820]  The people across the street from me, I didn't know their names for six years.
[36:29.580 --> 36:36.680]  I remember saying goodbye to my old neighbor who lived next door to a house where some crazy
[36:36.680 --> 36:41.160]  shit happened. And I said, sorry for being the worst neighbors in the world.
[36:41.340 --> 36:43.780]  And he said it was real interesting.
[36:50.010 --> 36:52.150]  You're worse than the crazy shit that happened.
[36:53.350 --> 36:56.810]  Dude, I feel like I would much rather never have a conversation than have to
[36:56.810 --> 36:58.710]  carry that one around for the rest of my life.
[37:00.570 --> 37:02.330]  It was real interesting.
[37:02.570 --> 37:06.950]  Oh, man. I'll be thinking about that at 1 a.m. for the next 30 years.
[37:09.250 --> 37:11.830]  How often do they think about how interesting it was?
[37:12.610 --> 37:15.990]  How much did they enjoy the interest that you generated for them?
[37:16.190 --> 37:18.990]  Like, interesting isn't good. If it was good, he would have said good.
[37:19.110 --> 37:21.490]  It was interesting was like the nicest way he could say it.
[37:21.490 --> 37:24.590]  Yeah, it's the least offensive thing he could think of to say.
[37:24.790 --> 37:27.950]  I was fully expecting just a generic, you know, no worries, man.
[37:29.250 --> 37:30.850]  Don't be a stranger or whatever.
[37:32.130 --> 37:35.090]  Well, I'm assuming it's slow-mo stuff, right? That was the cause of...
[37:37.170 --> 37:38.470]  No. Okay.
[37:41.310 --> 37:42.770]  Because that's a good interesting.
[37:43.310 --> 37:46.710]  It's like you're blowing shit up next door and filming in slow motion.
[37:47.650 --> 37:48.530]  Very interesting.
[37:48.670 --> 37:50.850]  No, people are honestly usually keen with the slow-mo stuff.
[37:50.850 --> 37:51.630]  They're interested.
[37:51.830 --> 37:52.150]  Yeah.
[37:52.150 --> 37:53.890]  The other thing that they're not as keen on.
[37:58.890 --> 38:04.310]  I'm excited that when we're done with this podcast today, we're going to record a gameplay.
[38:05.090 --> 38:06.590]  And I don't know when it's going to come out.
[38:06.910 --> 38:08.370]  I don't know if it's like a surprise or anything.
[38:08.490 --> 38:09.690]  Does anybody have any opinions on that?
[38:09.870 --> 38:11.110]  It should come out before the end of the year.
[38:12.270 --> 38:13.730]  I bet it doesn't.
[38:14.010 --> 38:15.270]  Yeah, I bet it doesn't as well.
[38:15.410 --> 38:16.270]  Well, I don't know.
[38:16.410 --> 38:18.590]  You think you're... I think maybe you're insane.
[38:19.990 --> 38:24.430]  Well, I mean, it's technically a part of a series that always comes out this time of year.
[38:24.630 --> 38:29.970]  Well, it's a start of a new tradition where we film it in the correct month,
[38:29.990 --> 38:32.630]  and then we release it when we're able to.
[38:32.930 --> 38:37.630]  That's been a tradition for six good months right now of that tradition.
[38:38.090 --> 38:42.230]  You don't think we could record and upload a video with a two-week window?
[38:42.750 --> 38:46.510]  It's not that it's... First of all, it's a two-week window and a time in which
[38:46.510 --> 38:52.410]  people are the least available of the year. Second of all, we already have stuff scheduled.
[38:52.630 --> 38:54.810]  We're scheduled for the rest of the year. You were in the meeting.
[38:55.010 --> 38:57.770]  It was a very big point that I made about scheduling to the end of the year.
[38:57.970 --> 39:02.450]  We can shuffle stuff, but two major holidays in the next two weeks
[39:02.450 --> 39:04.210]  is going to really get in the way of...
[39:04.210 --> 39:06.490]  Yeah, and the day that this is released is Christmas.
[39:06.970 --> 39:11.390]  And I would argue the third thing is that this is a completely different interpretation
[39:12.090 --> 39:16.230]  of a thing. It's not like it's the exact same thing.
[39:16.310 --> 39:17.250]  It's not a one-to-one.
[39:17.850 --> 39:21.430]  Different thing. It's like a thematic or thematic sequel.
[39:21.770 --> 39:22.650]  Yeah, real different.
[39:23.110 --> 39:28.590]  Well, it's in a completely different game with different people.
[39:29.670 --> 39:35.670]  Well, anyway, if you're a real fucking different man, if this sounds interesting to you,
[39:35.670 --> 39:36.870]  keep an eye out.
[39:37.410 --> 39:41.350]  Sometime in the undefined nearest future, probably 2025,
[39:41.730 --> 39:47.490]  a video may come out that may or may not be a spiritual successor to another thing
[39:47.490 --> 39:49.990]  or identical to it. Well, you'll just have to wait and see.
[39:50.110 --> 39:53.890]  I understand that we're scheduled out. It's unlikely that it'll be done.
[39:53.930 --> 39:55.610]  But you're acting like it's completely impossible.
[39:55.930 --> 39:58.030]  It just seems like an insane suggestion.
[39:58.190 --> 39:58.990]  I don't think it's insane.
[39:59.010 --> 40:00.790]  You're acting like it was going to happen.
[40:00.970 --> 40:01.970]  I know how to get it done.
[40:02.310 --> 40:04.530]  I know how to get it done. Gavin said the magic word.
[40:04.530 --> 40:05.990]  We just need to get Ethan Hunt.
[40:07.370 --> 40:09.130]  The impossible impossible.
[40:09.290 --> 40:10.370]  We need to get IMF involved.
[40:10.570 --> 40:12.090]  This is impossible. He ain't accepting that mission.
[40:12.450 --> 40:14.170]  He's going to listen to it. I'm good.
[40:14.430 --> 40:16.030]  Send it straight to the top.
[40:19.710 --> 40:22.230]  004 is going to come through and edit this thing for us.
[40:22.370 --> 40:22.990]  So we should be okay.
[40:24.050 --> 40:26.630]  Now you're acting like this is the exact same thing.
[40:27.170 --> 40:30.130]  Is eating a meal with any group of people identical to you?
[40:30.230 --> 40:32.790]  This is great. This one to one that he's making.
[40:32.910 --> 40:34.190]  I'm so excited about. Go ahead.
[40:34.190 --> 40:35.530]  What did you just say?
[40:36.130 --> 40:40.810]  So you we are you're you're like, oh, it's completely the same.
[40:41.090 --> 40:44.990]  We're playing a different game and is different people involved in it.
[40:45.170 --> 40:48.130]  The only there's an act that's the same.
[40:48.390 --> 40:53.090]  So I'm saying like the act of eating dinner, although the same in concept
[40:53.090 --> 40:56.890]  is wildly different depending on who you're eating it with.
[40:57.070 --> 40:59.750]  Yeah, but dinner is a longstanding series.
[41:01.070 --> 41:02.950]  Dinner is a longstanding series.
[41:02.950 --> 41:05.210]  I have dinner all the time on the reg.
[41:05.510 --> 41:08.710]  And I don't think we can't get that done by tonight.
[41:08.810 --> 41:10.630]  We're going to have to have dinner for breakfast.
[41:11.790 --> 41:13.150]  You've never had dinner for breakfast?
[41:15.350 --> 41:17.330]  You've never had a breakfast there? You've never flipped it up?
[41:18.410 --> 41:20.570]  The breakfast for dinner was like my slide.
[41:20.710 --> 41:21.330]  It's eight out of ten.
[41:21.690 --> 41:23.050]  Yeah, this is an eight out of ten big time.
[41:24.290 --> 41:25.770]  It's just an insane.
[41:26.050 --> 41:29.110]  It's not insane to make a video that comes out.
[41:29.110 --> 41:33.350]  OK, are you having dinner every time at the exact same hour,
[41:33.430 --> 41:35.530]  the exact same minute, the exact same second?
[41:35.710 --> 41:38.910]  Are you not allowed to have dinner at nine o'clock one day
[41:38.910 --> 41:40.650]  and then seven o'clock another day?
[41:40.930 --> 41:41.850]  Dinner's still dinner.
[41:42.150 --> 41:43.490]  Yeah, dinner's still happening.
[41:43.630 --> 41:44.250]  Anytime in the evening.
[41:44.350 --> 41:46.570]  That's why I'm saying anytime in this entire month.
[41:46.890 --> 41:49.730]  This entire month of two weeks, two weeks.
[41:50.070 --> 41:52.730]  There's 20, what, 19 days left in this month?
[41:53.090 --> 41:53.810]  Cut out weekends.
[41:54.290 --> 41:54.770]  Cut out weekends.
[41:55.170 --> 41:56.770]  18, 17, 16, 15.
[41:57.150 --> 41:58.130]  You got 15 days.
[41:59.150 --> 42:00.710]  OK, 15 days of that weekend.
[42:01.050 --> 42:01.730]  You got Christmas.
[42:02.270 --> 42:03.390]  Yeah, you got New Year's.
[42:03.610 --> 42:04.450]  Well, that's next month.
[42:04.670 --> 42:05.870]  Cut out Christmas Eve, please.
[42:05.970 --> 42:07.450]  I'm not making anybody work on Christmas Eve.
[42:07.630 --> 42:08.150]  Christmas Eve.
[42:08.270 --> 42:08.830]  I mean, that's cruel.
[42:09.030 --> 42:09.510]  10 days.
[42:09.730 --> 42:15.650]  It can't be done, but you seem to you're it's the fact that you're acting like this is a tradition
[42:15.650 --> 42:19.290]  that needs to be upheld when I'm saying that I don't think it is part of the tradition.
[42:19.550 --> 42:19.810]  All right.
[42:20.110 --> 42:23.910]  It was just, you know, nice to have an end of year, a little summery, a little something.
[42:24.330 --> 42:24.670]  I agree.
[42:24.670 --> 42:29.650]  And that's why we're going to do our best to get that video out in 2024.
[42:29.810 --> 42:33.070]  And when we don't, it'll be out in 2025.
[42:33.650 --> 42:35.030]  Yeah, I just want to rewind a little bit.
[42:35.090 --> 42:37.030]  So is dinner your favorite series or no?
[42:37.250 --> 42:38.150]  Uh, it's up there.
[42:38.290 --> 42:38.810]  That's a good one.
[42:39.630 --> 42:42.430]  What's the most important series of the day to get right?
[42:44.630 --> 42:46.430]  Because I feel like breakfast.
[42:48.190 --> 42:51.150]  I canceled breakfast years ago.
[42:56.350 --> 42:57.550]  Guys, I got big news.
[42:57.710 --> 42:59.170]  Lunch is being renewed.
[43:00.570 --> 43:04.510]  I like how each other's throats we are throughout throughout the show in them
[43:04.510 --> 43:06.930]  in the most low stakes way possible.
[43:09.330 --> 43:12.310]  I don't think anything we've ever talked about matters.
[43:17.350 --> 43:20.030]  I'm at a 9.7 right now.
[43:20.030 --> 43:21.590]  This is the happiest I've been in a while.
[43:22.130 --> 43:26.010]  The most important series of the day was such a good line.
[43:26.450 --> 43:27.810]  God, it's so funny.
[43:29.110 --> 43:29.930]  Holy shit.
[43:29.930 --> 43:31.170]  You hear about the spinoff?
[43:31.230 --> 43:32.090]  It's called brunch.
[43:32.270 --> 43:33.790]  It's fucking crazy.
[43:34.650 --> 43:35.830]  Mid-season pickup.
[43:39.970 --> 43:42.270]  I wish you would go back and do more dinner.
[43:42.410 --> 43:43.830]  I'm sick of all this brunch stuff.
[43:45.090 --> 43:46.190]  Oh, we're doing February.
[43:46.370 --> 43:48.450]  I hear this 28 episode run in February.
[43:48.710 --> 43:49.030]  Shit.
[43:50.030 --> 43:50.850]  It's a leap year.
[43:51.010 --> 43:56.070]  Oh, this is great.
[43:57.350 --> 43:59.450]  Speaking of getting a meal together, the other day,
[43:59.590 --> 44:02.510]  Eric and Nick and I got hot dogs together at a new place.
[44:02.590 --> 44:03.170]  What was that place called?
[44:03.290 --> 44:04.030]  Mad Dogs?
[44:04.430 --> 44:06.610]  I was jealous of those pictures coming in.
[44:06.750 --> 44:08.810]  I can tell from all the paper you're in the same place.
[44:09.070 --> 44:10.650]  So do we thumbs up or down that place?
[44:10.770 --> 44:13.270]  Is that a place where we're promoting, condoning?
[44:13.510 --> 44:14.810]  I think it's good if you're around there.
[44:14.890 --> 44:19.370]  It's definitely like a late night drunk spot, but I mean, it's also hot dogs.
[44:19.370 --> 44:21.610]  So really, it wasn't going to be bad.
[44:21.710 --> 44:22.150]  It was pretty good.
[44:22.230 --> 44:22.590]  I liked it.
[44:22.910 --> 44:23.850]  Chili cheese fries were great.
[44:24.130 --> 44:27.010]  I think the chili cheese fries were better than the hot dogs, but the hot dogs were fine.
[44:27.190 --> 44:28.990]  Yeah, definitely worth checking out.
[44:29.070 --> 44:32.970]  If you're over there, I wouldn't make a journey to get there or anything.
[44:33.210 --> 44:34.870]  But yeah, did you guys talk about anything cool?
[44:35.930 --> 44:37.150]  What did we talk about?
[44:38.070 --> 44:39.590]  I don't know that it was anything cool.
[44:39.810 --> 44:42.590]  We just kind of, just like a lot of chatter, some work stuff,
[44:42.810 --> 44:43.950]  figured out some different things.
[44:44.830 --> 44:45.590]  Yeah, I don't know.
[44:45.670 --> 44:46.390]  I thought it was nice.
[44:47.070 --> 44:48.070]  I pitched them.
[44:48.250 --> 44:50.850]  I pitched the boys on an idea that I pitched Andrew on recently.
[44:52.130 --> 44:53.430]  Kind of threw that out there.
[44:53.630 --> 44:57.130]  Would you say that lunch is getting renewed based off of that experience?
[44:57.390 --> 44:59.950]  Yeah, I would like to renew.
[45:00.150 --> 45:01.130]  I would like to renew.
[45:01.750 --> 45:05.550]  Maybe in a, I don't know if it's considered the same series if we renew,
[45:05.750 --> 45:07.070]  but we go to a different location.
[45:07.630 --> 45:11.150]  Like if we shoot in a different location, because I'd like to, I'd like to go to,
[45:11.410 --> 45:13.470]  yesterday I had not a damn chance burger.
[45:14.150 --> 45:16.750]  And it's one of the best hamburgers I've had in a long time.
[45:16.890 --> 45:19.890]  And so if we were to have another lunch, I'd like to, I'd like to do it.
[45:19.930 --> 45:21.130]  But I'd like to change.
[45:21.390 --> 45:23.750]  I don't know if it has to be a new series order or if we,
[45:24.150 --> 45:26.970]  if it's considered as a part of the same lunch, but I'd like to have it there.
[45:27.190 --> 45:30.070]  How many consecutive lunches in a row does Gavin need to be part of
[45:30.070 --> 45:32.990]  to be bumped from a special guest to series regular?
[45:33.510 --> 45:33.830]  Six.
[45:34.670 --> 45:35.330]  Six, okay.
[45:37.710 --> 45:38.990]  Because I'd like to see him in the mix.
[45:39.070 --> 45:40.430]  I really enjoyed his one appearance.
[45:40.590 --> 45:41.450]  It was great.
[45:41.450 --> 45:43.230]  We'd all like to see him in the mix.
[45:43.390 --> 45:44.370]  Everyone would love to see him.
[45:44.450 --> 45:46.670]  When he guests, he's the most popular.
[45:46.770 --> 45:47.650]  Everybody loves to see it.
[45:48.070 --> 45:48.810]  Brightens everyone's day.
[45:48.890 --> 45:49.910]  And he needs to eat a hot dog.
[45:50.790 --> 45:51.790]  Easy to hot dog?
[45:52.230 --> 45:53.030]  No, he needs to eat a hot dog.
[45:53.030 --> 45:53.870]  He needs to eat a hot dog.
[45:53.910 --> 45:57.610]  We were talking about if you would have gotten a hot dog while we were there or
[45:57.610 --> 45:59.410]  because they had hamburgers and stuff too.
[45:59.570 --> 46:01.650]  And we were just wondering if like you would have gotten a hot dog.
[46:02.090 --> 46:03.810]  I feel like if everyone else was dogging, I'd dog.
[46:04.130 --> 46:04.950]  I agree with that.
[46:05.310 --> 46:06.310]  That seems like the move.
[46:06.990 --> 46:09.750]  A massage chair might seem a bit extravagant,
[46:09.750 --> 46:11.250]  especially these days.
[46:11.710 --> 46:14.270]  Eight different settings, adjustable intensity.
[46:14.810 --> 46:18.050]  Plus it's heated and it just feels so good.
[46:19.250 --> 46:23.810]  Yes, a massage chair might seem a bit extravagant, but when it can come with a car,
[46:25.350 --> 46:27.390]  suddenly it seems quite practical.
[46:28.070 --> 46:30.530]  The all new 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan,
[46:30.870 --> 46:34.130]  packed with premium features like available massaging front seats.
[46:34.470 --> 46:36.030]  It only feels extravagant.
[46:36.950 --> 46:38.010]  Today's top story.
[46:38.370 --> 46:42.350]  The flavor merger of the century between the Peanut Butter Group and Chocolaty Corp.
[46:42.510 --> 46:44.390]  Joining me is a PBC executive.
[46:44.630 --> 46:45.590]  Thanks for having me, Barry.
[46:45.990 --> 46:49.030]  Now, how did you know the merger and the byproduct of it,
[46:49.230 --> 46:52.210]  Jif Peanut Butter and Chocolate Flavored Spread, would be a success?
[46:52.610 --> 46:54.490]  You know, it was a gut feeling.
[46:54.830 --> 46:56.470]  A rumbling, if you will.
[46:56.810 --> 46:58.970]  Besides, they're two titans of taste.
[46:59.090 --> 46:59.550]  Very true.
[46:59.990 --> 47:01.210]  Goes great with pretzels.
[47:01.430 --> 47:02.130]  And pancakes.
[47:02.670 --> 47:03.430]  Apples too, I bet.
[47:03.850 --> 47:05.070]  Try Jif PBC today.
[47:06.690 --> 47:07.770]  What's sarsaparilla?
[47:08.290 --> 47:08.430]  What?
[47:08.930 --> 47:09.170]  What?
[47:09.510 --> 47:11.490]  Somebody spelled sarsaparilla wrong.
[47:11.830 --> 47:12.170]  Oh, okay.
[47:12.290 --> 47:12.490]  I think.
[47:12.590 --> 47:13.250]  Was that talked about ever?
[47:14.410 --> 47:14.950]  Sarsaparilla?
[47:15.270 --> 47:16.450]  Sioux City sarsaparilla?
[47:16.770 --> 47:17.790]  No, sarsaparilla.
[47:18.410 --> 47:18.950]  Sarsaparilla.
[47:19.010 --> 47:20.650]  No, I don't think anybody mentioned sarsaparilla.
[47:20.870 --> 47:21.070]  Okay.
[47:22.670 --> 47:22.930]  No.
[47:26.030 --> 47:27.430]  No fucking clue.
[47:27.750 --> 47:29.350]  I don't even know what we're talking about.
[47:29.770 --> 47:32.790]  That Nick posted a Reddit thread in the Discord
[47:32.790 --> 47:36.470]  where somebody was asking if where you can get sarsaparilla on tap.
[47:37.010 --> 47:38.690]  There's no useful info in there, by the way.
[47:38.830 --> 47:40.750]  But they spelled sarsaparilla.
[47:41.030 --> 47:43.990]  S-A-R-S-A-P-A-R-I-L-L-A.
[47:45.430 --> 47:45.870]  Sarsaparilla.
[47:46.290 --> 47:47.290]  I have a question for Gavin.
[47:47.550 --> 47:47.750]  Okay.
[47:47.990 --> 47:48.790]  You went home recently.
[47:49.190 --> 47:49.370]  Yeah.
[47:49.450 --> 47:53.530]  You do any good scouting of like what the current British snack scene is?
[47:53.670 --> 47:55.690]  Oh my god, that's how it's spelled.
[47:55.910 --> 47:56.850]  Yeah, it is how it's spelled.
[47:57.830 --> 47:59.570]  Sarsaparilla is how you spell sarsaparilla.
[47:59.690 --> 48:02.110]  I had no idea that's how you spell sarsaparilla.
[48:02.110 --> 48:03.990]  That doesn't look right at all.
[48:04.410 --> 48:05.410]  Holy shit.
[48:05.530 --> 48:07.170]  Why is it pronounced sarsaparilla?
[48:07.450 --> 48:08.290]  I don't know.
[48:08.530 --> 48:09.750]  That's blown my mind.
[48:10.130 --> 48:11.910]  That yeah, that just looks weird.
[48:11.910 --> 48:13.430]  It looks so wrong written sarsaparilla.
[48:13.670 --> 48:17.250]  Nick, you're the only one of us that isn't a dumbass right now.
[48:17.350 --> 48:18.810]  Eric is a dumbass by omission.
[48:19.330 --> 48:20.050]  He was right.
[48:20.130 --> 48:20.810]  He would have chimed in.
[48:21.230 --> 48:22.230]  So we know he didn't know.
[48:22.870 --> 48:27.350]  But Gavin and Andrew and I are fucking stupid.
[48:27.670 --> 48:29.630]  Well, I've only heard it said.
[48:29.750 --> 48:30.590]  I don't think I've ever seen it written.
[48:30.590 --> 48:31.750]  Yeah, I've never seen it written.
[48:31.750 --> 48:33.590]  So Nick, you already knew that?
[48:33.770 --> 48:34.930]  Yeah, from The Simpsons.
[48:36.690 --> 48:38.890]  I've also seen The Simpsons, but I didn't know it.
[48:38.950 --> 48:41.450]  That was the episode where Grandpa Simpson has his kidneys explode.
[48:41.670 --> 48:42.970]  He keeps drinking the sarsaparillas at the bar.
[48:43.450 --> 48:44.310]  Is that what happens?
[48:44.490 --> 48:46.450]  And it's spelled correctly on the bar.
[48:46.470 --> 48:48.670]  Yeah, his kidneys explode because he held his pee afterwards.
[48:50.490 --> 48:52.130]  I'm not going to call it sarsaparilla anymore.
[48:52.230 --> 48:53.930]  I'm going to call it what it is, sarsaparilla.
[48:56.150 --> 48:58.530]  I'm going to order a Sioux City sarsaparilla.
[48:58.710 --> 48:59.550]  I never thought about it.
[48:59.550 --> 49:02.690]  I've seen it spelled so many times because of Fallout New Vegas,
[49:02.810 --> 49:04.090]  and that is how it's spelled everywhere.
[49:05.550 --> 49:08.270]  The word is so long with so many S's.
[49:08.410 --> 49:10.030]  It's just a series of squiggles to me.
[49:10.390 --> 49:11.910]  You just never looked at it.
[49:12.030 --> 49:12.490]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:12.570 --> 49:14.850]  Like, you see it, nothing else looks...
[49:14.850 --> 49:20.370]  Like, marsupial is the only word that looks similar to sarsaparilla.
[49:21.230 --> 49:24.530]  Yeah, if it doesn't start with an M, then I know it's sarsaparilla.
[49:24.730 --> 49:26.390]  If it starts with an M, I know it's marsupial.
[49:28.650 --> 49:29.130]  Marsupial.
[49:29.310 --> 49:31.810]  We should invent a drink called sarsaparilla,
[49:32.030 --> 49:34.490]  and it's spelled the way we think sarsaparilla is,
[49:34.810 --> 49:39.630]  and then put that out, and then we can sue all the makers of sarsaparilla
[49:39.630 --> 49:41.370]  for stealing our fucking product.
[49:41.690 --> 49:43.950]  Andrew, is that how you think you spell marsupial?
[49:44.350 --> 49:46.610]  I just, I took a swing at it.
[49:46.690 --> 49:47.830]  I've never done it.
[49:47.930 --> 49:49.150]  I've never thought about it.
[49:49.310 --> 49:51.830]  You think it has the word soup in the middle?
[49:52.190 --> 49:54.530]  Yeah, well, it's very, it sounds like that.
[49:55.090 --> 49:56.710]  Okay, let me try to figure this out.
[49:56.730 --> 50:00.190]  So my initial attempt was M-A-R-S-O-U-P-I-A-L.
[50:01.490 --> 50:02.550]  What about this?
[50:02.750 --> 50:03.710]  Oh, you know what?
[50:03.750 --> 50:05.530]  What if I get a little fancy with it?
[50:06.130 --> 50:06.930]  Oh, that's...
[50:07.350 --> 50:07.750]  Marsupial.
[50:09.010 --> 50:11.370]  M-A-R-S-U-P-I-A-L.
[50:12.210 --> 50:12.610]  Marsupial?
[50:16.130 --> 50:17.050]  What about this?
[50:19.050 --> 50:21.330]  M-A-R-S-O-U-P-P-I-A-L.
[50:21.990 --> 50:22.470]  Marsupial?
[50:23.550 --> 50:25.390]  You got real close once.
[50:25.850 --> 50:30.850]  Okay, M-A-R-E-S-O-U-P-I-A-L.
[50:31.350 --> 50:31.630]  What?
[50:32.170 --> 50:32.650]  No.
[50:33.830 --> 50:34.310]  Marsupial?
[50:35.530 --> 50:36.010]  Marsupial.
[50:37.930 --> 50:38.890]  What? Marsupial?
[50:38.890 --> 50:40.030]  Okay, tell me, let me...
[50:40.030 --> 50:40.670]  Are we just gonna keep going until you spot it?
[50:40.690 --> 50:43.650]  I'm gonna start going letter by letter, and you tell me when I'm wrong,
[50:43.730 --> 50:45.150]  and then I'll work until I get it right.
[50:45.410 --> 50:45.550]  That way.
[50:46.190 --> 50:46.450]  M.
[50:47.110 --> 50:47.710]  Yeah, you got that.
[50:48.090 --> 50:48.410]  A.
[50:48.650 --> 50:48.970]  Yep.
[50:49.430 --> 50:49.770]  R.
[50:50.290 --> 50:50.550]  Yep.
[50:51.090 --> 50:51.570]  R?
[50:51.850 --> 50:52.330]  No.
[50:52.730 --> 50:52.850]  What?
[50:53.070 --> 50:53.290]  S.
[50:53.550 --> 50:53.990]  Yes.
[50:55.130 --> 50:55.610]  O.
[50:55.850 --> 50:56.150]  No.
[50:56.270 --> 50:56.510]  No.
[50:57.210 --> 50:57.570]  U.
[50:57.910 --> 50:58.170]  Yes.
[50:58.170 --> 50:58.490]  Yes.
[50:59.050 --> 50:59.390]  P.
[50:59.630 --> 51:02.110]  Am I an idiot? Isn't it exactly how it sounds?
[51:02.450 --> 51:02.590]  Yes.
[51:02.950 --> 51:03.090]  Yes.
[51:03.610 --> 51:04.090]  A.
[51:04.450 --> 51:04.790]  Yes.
[51:05.530 --> 51:08.210]  I can't believe I never put that in. That's insane.
[51:08.610 --> 51:09.090]  L.
[51:09.330 --> 51:10.990]  I made like 15 guesses.
[51:11.350 --> 51:13.650]  You got real close, you just had two P's on one of them.
[51:14.030 --> 51:18.030]  I've just looked it up, and Sarsaparilla, spelled how I thought it was spelled,
[51:18.430 --> 51:20.590]  is available for $12,000.
[51:20.810 --> 51:21.990]  Oh my god.
[51:22.550 --> 51:25.410]  We're gonna have to sell a lot of sarsaparilla to afford that.
[51:29.050 --> 51:31.050]  Fucking... is sarsaparilla available?
[51:31.510 --> 51:33.590]  Yeah, yeah, look up sarsaparilla.com.
[51:33.810 --> 51:35.290]  No one will ever go to it, but check it out.
[51:38.010 --> 51:38.970]  sarsaparilla.com.
[51:40.790 --> 51:41.750]  Unavailable, unfortunately.
[51:42.130 --> 51:42.610]  Bummer.
[51:43.410 --> 51:46.190]  What about any of the ways Andrew spelled marsupial?
[51:48.530 --> 51:53.150]  Boy, mars with soup in the middle is so crazy.
[51:53.630 --> 51:55.170]  Sorry, 404 error.
[51:55.590 --> 51:59.310]  I need to email webmaster at marsupial.com.
[51:59.690 --> 52:02.030]  Would any of the marsupials be soupable?
[52:02.390 --> 52:04.310]  What's the most soupable marsupial?
[52:04.550 --> 52:05.570]  Oh, that's a great question.
[52:06.230 --> 52:07.870]  I gave you a list. There it is.
[52:08.350 --> 52:09.730]  Possum soup exists.
[52:10.230 --> 52:11.730]  Kangaroo soup is probably real.
[52:12.090 --> 52:16.470]  Yeah, potaroos, that seems like potatoes, and I think you could probably do that.
[52:16.470 --> 52:20.270]  Oh, po-ta-roo.
[52:20.490 --> 52:23.190]  Potaroo, that seems like potato. It's pretty close.
[52:23.590 --> 52:24.970]  I would eat a bandicoot.
[52:25.150 --> 52:27.030]  Oh, dude, did you know that I only found out...
[52:27.530 --> 52:30.150]  Okay, that sucks. Andrew, it's in front of you.
[52:30.670 --> 52:34.050]  Yeah, I can't see it. It's too small. I'd have to click it.
[52:34.210 --> 52:37.570]  I only found out a bandicoot was a real animal like last year.
[52:37.790 --> 52:38.030]  Really?
[52:38.430 --> 52:40.770]  Yeah, I thought it was made up. I thought they made up a bandicoot.
[52:42.130 --> 52:44.770]  I learned wolverines are real from Far Cry.
[52:45.730 --> 52:47.110]  And I was disappointed.
[52:47.690 --> 52:49.010]  You just think it was an X-Man?
[52:49.350 --> 52:51.130]  Yeah, I just thought it was an X-Man name.
[52:51.210 --> 52:55.030]  And you thought the Michigan Wolverines named themselves after a movie?
[52:55.030 --> 52:58.670]  I don't have Michigan Wolverines in my life. It's a U.S. college.
[52:58.810 --> 53:00.730]  What about Tasmanian devils?
[53:01.110 --> 53:03.130]  Yeah, they'd strike me as real.
[53:03.410 --> 53:04.330]  That's a cryptid.
[53:06.170 --> 53:09.530]  Did you say that you couldn't read the spelling because it's too small?
[53:09.790 --> 53:10.010]  Yeah.
[53:10.290 --> 53:11.390]  You know you can click on it.
[53:11.650 --> 53:12.170]  You can click on it.
[53:12.210 --> 53:14.670]  Yeah, I said I'd have to click on it.
[53:14.770 --> 53:15.870]  I specified that.
[53:16.010 --> 53:16.970]  Oh, we will, you know.
[53:18.710 --> 53:19.950]  What's a numbat?
[53:20.130 --> 53:21.730]  Numbat might be my new favorite creature.
[53:21.830 --> 53:23.950]  These things are, oh my god, these things are cool.
[53:24.090 --> 53:25.230]  I believe a numbat.
[53:25.630 --> 53:27.250]  Look at this thing. Look at his tongue.
[53:28.230 --> 53:29.110]  Oh, wow.
[53:29.710 --> 53:31.550]  Dude, numbat might be the new hotness.
[53:31.850 --> 53:32.830]  You know that dude's popular.
[53:33.090 --> 53:34.690]  There's a lot of non-bat bats.
[53:34.990 --> 53:35.350]  Yeah.
[53:36.170 --> 53:37.990]  Should we have a bats not bats draft?
[53:38.310 --> 53:38.990]  Might be worth doing.
[53:39.150 --> 53:40.490]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[53:40.870 --> 53:42.090]  Bats not bats draft.
[53:42.270 --> 53:43.330]  I'm putting it on the list here.
[53:43.330 --> 53:44.850]  I'll put it on the numbat one bat.
[53:45.070 --> 53:48.630]  Is Bruce Wayne a bat that's not a bat or is Batman a bat that's not a bat?
[53:48.650 --> 53:49.170]  I think so.
[53:49.310 --> 53:50.190]  He's not an actual bat.
[53:50.390 --> 53:50.530]  Yeah.
[53:50.790 --> 53:51.750]  Is man bat one?
[53:51.950 --> 53:53.370]  Well, I mean, I think he's part bat.
[53:53.390 --> 53:54.550]  I think he's part bat.
[53:54.770 --> 53:54.990]  Yeah.
[53:55.350 --> 53:58.550]  Is Bruce Wayne more bat than Batman is?
[53:59.030 --> 54:01.330]  I want you to explain what you mean.
[54:01.630 --> 54:05.670]  OK, so Bruce Wayne is just a guy, right?
[54:05.890 --> 54:07.170]  But he's super into bats.
[54:07.690 --> 54:12.110]  I would say that Bruce Wayne comes across as more of a bat enthusiast than Batman.
[54:12.110 --> 54:17.570]  You think the guy who goes about his life in a business suit from day to day
[54:18.710 --> 54:23.790]  expresses more bat like aura than a guy who flies around dressed up as a bat all night
[54:23.790 --> 54:25.150]  and says he's a bat man?
[54:25.450 --> 54:27.410]  And hangs upside down and jumps on people?
[54:27.630 --> 54:29.610]  When you put it like that, no, no.
[54:29.910 --> 54:33.790]  When you explain it or we think about it for two seconds.
[54:33.990 --> 54:34.990]  No, I guess I'm wrong.
[54:35.170 --> 54:35.490]  No, no, no.
[54:35.530 --> 54:38.590]  It's just my thought was that like Batman to me is not...
[54:39.070 --> 54:40.730]  When I see Batman, I don't think bat.
[54:40.730 --> 54:42.410]  I think of like Cape Crusader.
[54:42.610 --> 54:44.550]  I think it's the fucking first thing I think.
[54:44.690 --> 54:46.150]  I think I don't think of bats.
[54:46.650 --> 54:49.650]  But Bruce Wayne, that's a bat on it, like on his chest.
[54:49.810 --> 54:50.250]  Totally.
[54:50.450 --> 54:50.870]  Absolutely.
[54:51.030 --> 54:51.770]  Like the symbolism.
[54:51.950 --> 54:56.690]  But he doesn't go is I can't like there's no way for me to explain this in a way that
[54:56.690 --> 54:57.770]  would make sense to anybody else.
[54:57.810 --> 55:04.830]  But Batman himself as a person doesn't necessarily strike me as a dude who's into bat as much
[55:04.830 --> 55:11.630]  as he is just a Batman, where Bruce Wayne strikes me as a man that is into bats, but
[55:11.630 --> 55:14.510]  has nothing to do with them, but is very into them.
[55:14.930 --> 55:19.590]  So so he's more of a bat enthusiast than when he's a bat.
[55:19.850 --> 55:21.670]  He's less of when he's a bat.
[55:21.730 --> 55:22.690]  He's just a bat.
[55:22.750 --> 55:24.130]  He just happens to be a bat.
[55:24.550 --> 55:29.810]  But when he's a man, just a normal man, he is an enthusiast of bats.
[55:30.610 --> 55:33.070]  Is this the worst thing you've ever said?
[55:33.570 --> 55:34.330]  I don't think so.
[55:34.830 --> 55:36.570]  I'm at a four, I think.
[55:37.190 --> 55:38.370]  Yeah, I want to slide.
[55:39.710 --> 55:40.130]  What?
[55:40.130 --> 55:43.530]  There's going to be one person that gets what I'm saying and they're with me and that's
[55:43.530 --> 55:43.750]  OK.
[55:43.830 --> 55:44.630]  Oh, that's a bummer.
[55:44.670 --> 55:49.510]  The other version of him, he has bat wing cape and flies around.
[55:50.150 --> 55:52.210]  He lives in a bat cave.
[55:52.570 --> 55:53.690]  He drives a bat car.
[55:55.190 --> 55:57.930]  But he OK, but Bruce Wayne put all that together.
[55:58.050 --> 55:59.810]  He throws a batarang.
[56:00.550 --> 56:01.090]  They're one in this.
[56:01.290 --> 56:02.290]  Bruce Wayne did all that.
[56:02.290 --> 56:07.730]  I think Batman is a product of Bruce Wayne, who's really into bats.
[56:08.050 --> 56:12.570]  So because Bruce Wayne decided and created a costume when he was a bat,
[56:12.670 --> 56:14.810]  he is more Batman than when he's wearing it.
[56:15.170 --> 56:15.530]  Yes.
[56:15.830 --> 56:16.930]  That's what you mean?
[56:17.330 --> 56:18.130]  Like, yes.
[56:21.530 --> 56:27.730]  I would say that he's more than a Batman, but when he wears the costume,
[56:27.730 --> 56:33.310]  he is the distilled vision of what his bat enthusiasm is.
[56:33.370 --> 56:35.270]  He is the most of that thing he could be.
[56:35.450 --> 56:42.390]  So when Tony Stark makes Peter Parker in the nanotech spider suit with the
[56:42.390 --> 56:46.970]  four other legs that come out of the back, does that mean Tony Stark is Spider-Man?
[56:47.630 --> 56:49.310]  Can I rephrase this in a different way?
[56:50.570 --> 56:53.890]  OK, so let's say Crocodile Dundee.
[56:54.250 --> 56:56.070]  That guy's really into crocodiles.
[56:56.090 --> 56:57.070]  I got this.
[56:57.070 --> 56:57.790]  I like this.
[56:57.790 --> 56:58.330]  But he's a man.
[56:58.870 --> 57:00.990]  But he's a man and he's super into crocodiles.
[57:01.210 --> 57:02.430]  He's clearly into crocodiles.
[57:02.770 --> 57:05.550]  If he, if Crocodile Dundee was a crocodile,
[57:06.490 --> 57:08.670]  that doesn't necessarily mean he's into crocodiles.
[57:08.870 --> 57:09.650]  He's just a crocodile.
[57:10.030 --> 57:11.110]  But he is a man.
[57:11.470 --> 57:12.890]  But he's more of a crocodile.
[57:13.330 --> 57:13.510]  What?
[57:13.710 --> 57:16.570]  If he was a crocodile, he'd be more of a crocodile than a human man.
[57:17.790 --> 57:18.970]  Yeah, but I'm saying...
[57:18.970 --> 57:22.350]  Do you think Batman likes bats less than Bruce Wayne likes bats?
[57:22.450 --> 57:23.090]  Is that what you're saying?
[57:23.130 --> 57:23.310]  Well, OK.
[57:23.630 --> 57:24.370]  I'm a person.
[57:24.690 --> 57:26.670]  That doesn't mean I'm a person enthusiast.
[57:28.610 --> 57:29.050]  So...
[57:29.050 --> 57:31.350]  But if a dog was really into person culture,
[57:31.670 --> 57:35.450]  they would be more of an enthusiast about being a person than I am.
[57:35.590 --> 57:38.550]  So there's a man and a raccoon in the street.
[57:38.790 --> 57:39.750]  There's a bus coming for them.
[57:39.790 --> 57:41.050]  You can dive and save one of them.
[57:41.090 --> 57:42.650]  You would not save the person?
[57:42.930 --> 57:44.470]  No, I'd save the person.
[57:44.530 --> 57:44.830]  Absolutely.
[57:45.170 --> 57:47.290]  Even if you're not a huge people person?
[57:47.490 --> 57:47.750]  Yeah.
[57:48.050 --> 57:51.070]  Well, because I value a human life more than a raccoon life.
[57:51.330 --> 57:52.690]  That's pretty people of you.
[57:52.690 --> 57:56.370]  Unless the human made the whatever, the slug bomb,
[57:56.630 --> 58:00.090]  the food bank, whatever weapon you made.
[58:00.390 --> 58:01.090]  I'd let them get hit.
[58:01.330 --> 58:03.990]  What if the raccoon was a guardian of the galaxy, though,
[58:04.050 --> 58:05.450]  and trying on an important mission?
[58:05.950 --> 58:06.550]  Well, now that's...
[58:07.090 --> 58:09.170]  You threw a real wrench in this plan.
[58:09.670 --> 58:14.470]  How much time do I have to determine if this raccoon is a guardian of the galaxy or not?
[58:14.490 --> 58:16.870]  I mean, it has to have a laser blaster on it, probably.
[58:17.350 --> 58:18.330]  Or like bandoleros.
[58:18.890 --> 58:19.130]  You know what I mean?
[58:19.130 --> 58:21.350]  I think I would be able to identify that quick enough
[58:21.350 --> 58:22.910]  that I would be able to make the right choice.
[58:23.170 --> 58:23.590]  Fair enough.
[58:23.770 --> 58:26.730]  Although I think Rocket Raccoon could survive getting hit by a bus.
[58:27.010 --> 58:28.030]  Could he? Love to find out.
[58:28.230 --> 58:29.550]  Someone understands what I'm saying.
[58:30.870 --> 58:33.930]  Well, I think I do, but I don't know why you're saying it.
[58:34.010 --> 58:34.310]  Yeah.
[58:34.470 --> 58:37.150]  I don't remember either because we've gotten so far off track.
[58:37.690 --> 58:39.290]  I don't remember what started the conversation.
[58:39.730 --> 58:40.130]  Numbats.
[58:40.870 --> 58:41.270]  Numbats.
[58:41.770 --> 58:42.330]  Or soup eel.
[58:42.590 --> 58:45.390]  Yeah, we were gonna have a bats not bats draft, I think.
[58:45.550 --> 58:48.050]  Oh, that's yeah. Yeah, exactly. Okay.
[58:48.270 --> 58:50.190]  So you would draft Bruce Wayne.
[58:50.190 --> 58:53.990]  I would draft Bruce Wayne over Batman because I think Bruce Wayne is more.
[58:54.230 --> 58:56.230]  You can have him. I mean, it's I'm drafting Batman, so it's fine.
[58:56.370 --> 58:57.430]  Yeah, so he'll win.
[58:57.570 --> 59:01.790]  But I'm drafting Danny DeVito as man bat who is still a man.
[59:01.850 --> 59:02.390]  Oh, fuckers.
[59:02.390 --> 59:03.810]  They're like man spider, not spider.
[59:03.850 --> 59:06.090]  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you messed it all up.
[59:06.130 --> 59:06.690]  You're all freaked out.
[59:06.890 --> 59:07.970]  Blew it all up in my head.
[59:08.170 --> 59:09.890]  I'd go Bruce Wayne, then Shohei Otani.
[59:10.190 --> 59:13.530]  Okay, I got my pick.
[59:13.590 --> 59:14.430]  I mean, I'm good.
[59:14.490 --> 59:16.750]  I already know who I'm drafting for my bat not bat draft.
[59:17.070 --> 59:17.530]  All four?
[59:18.270 --> 59:20.090]  No, I got I have most of them.
[59:20.190 --> 59:23.290]  I think, yeah, I could probably I could probably do it pretty easy.
[59:23.550 --> 59:24.970]  Is a vampire a bat not bat?
[59:25.190 --> 59:26.070]  A vampire is a bat.
[59:26.370 --> 59:26.590]  Really?
[59:28.130 --> 59:31.350]  What? I don't I don't know about that.
[59:31.570 --> 59:31.770]  About?
[59:32.130 --> 59:33.810]  In all cases is what I'm saying.
[59:33.930 --> 59:35.090]  A vampire being a bat.
[59:35.330 --> 59:36.870]  Well, I mean, in in reality, though.
[59:36.910 --> 59:40.830]  The Twilight kids are not that there are no bats involved in Twilight.
[59:41.190 --> 59:41.630]  It's baseball.
[59:41.950 --> 59:42.810]  Yeah, you know what?
[59:42.810 --> 59:43.930]  Actually, I take back my point.
[59:44.010 --> 59:44.310]  You're right.
[59:44.470 --> 59:45.230]  That's a good point.
[59:46.030 --> 59:47.230]  And baseball uses bats.
[59:47.630 --> 59:49.290]  Yeah, that's a great point.
[59:49.830 --> 59:50.410]  You're right.
[59:50.490 --> 59:51.270]  I was wrong about that.
[59:52.970 --> 59:55.590]  That was you deactivated the Twilight bats.
[59:55.790 --> 59:56.910]  Oh, man, that was impressive.
[59:57.450 --> 59:59.670]  That was no action movie deactivation.
[59:59.770 --> 01:00:02.750]  There was six minutes on the clock and you defuse that bomb.
[01:00:04.110 --> 01:00:04.970]  That was great.
[01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:06.290]  Just like Bruce Wayne would do.
[01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:08.330]  Just like Bruce Wayne would do.
[01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:13.590]  Do you think if it came down to it, you'd be a bomb defuser or a bomb get rid of a bomb?
[01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:14.170]  Get rid of her.
[01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:14.810]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:00:15.130 --> 01:00:16.650]  Sling it to safety.
[01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:18.290]  Yeah, I don't.
[01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:21.210]  Well, no, yeah, I'd get rid of it.
[01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:24.230]  I guess I would wonder if you cut a wire, would it instantly blow up?
[01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:27.610]  Because in movies, they always present that that like that could happen.
[01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:28.370]  Certainly could happen.
[01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:30.350]  What if you cut all wires at once?
[01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:31.770]  Has anyone ever done that?
[01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:33.170]  Same time?
[01:00:34.590 --> 01:00:37.150]  Well, if there's a battery that doesn't have wires.
[01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:42.250]  They always say that if you don't do it the right sequence, it'll trigger an immediate explosion.
[01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:48.750]  If people read the description of the episodes that I write before they listen to the episode,
[01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:54.310]  like the last things listed are the most soupable marsupial bat, not bat draft,
[01:00:54.670 --> 01:00:57.050]  a person enthusiast and bomb defusal.
[01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:59.410]  That is what we've been talking about.
[01:00:59.810 --> 01:01:02.370]  That is where we're at as a show.
[01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:04.170]  What are we going to talk about next time?
[01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:04.790]  I don't know.
[01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:06.250]  I'm excited to find out in 2025.
[01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:07.590]  This is exciting.
[01:01:07.810 --> 01:01:09.250]  Next episode will be the new year.
[01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:09.850]  Oh, sweet.
[01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:13.150]  If you Google image search bats that aren't bats,
[01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:16.410]  all you get is bats that are definitely bats.
[01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.970]  Interesting.
[01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:18.110]  Here.
[01:01:18.310 --> 01:01:18.990]  Yes, you do.
[01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:20.150]  It's just bats.
[01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:21.190]  It's just bats.
[01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:22.610]  It's just nothing but bats.
[01:01:22.770 --> 01:01:23.410]  Nothing but bats.
[01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:24.430]  It's Bat City.
[01:01:24.810 --> 01:01:26.090]  What would you expect it to return?
[01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:27.590]  Everything else that isn't a bat?
[01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:28.970]  A baseball bat, maybe?
[01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:31.510]  Bats that aren't animals.
[01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:34.450]  Nope, it's just still bats.
[01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:37.750]  Not a bat.
[01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:42.150]  What would you have to put into Google with bat as a part of your search for it to return
[01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:43.390]  no pictures of bats?
[01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:45.990]  I'm Googling, show me things that aren't bats.
[01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:47.150]  Google image search.
[01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:47.990]  First things a bat.
[01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:48.870]  Yeah, it's all bats.
[01:01:49.090 --> 01:01:52.630]  If you search, don't show me a single picture of a bat, would it show a bat?
[01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.790]  Okay, here.
[01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:53.610]  Here, hang on.
[01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:55.130]  Hang on.
[01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:56.010]  Here we go.
[01:01:56.190 --> 01:02:00.130]  Don't show me a single picture of a bat.
[01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:00.770]  Okay?
[01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:01.830]  Nope.
[01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:06.970]  It's just nothing but bats, guys.
[01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:09.470]  Can you search vampire for me, please?
[01:02:09.730 --> 01:02:10.550]  Search vampire?
[01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:11.790]  Yeah, look at vampire.
[01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:13.790]  Not a single bat.
[01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:15.790]  Not a single... well, there's some wings.
[01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:16.890]  There's a bat right here.
[01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:17.310]  Where?
[01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:18.530]  There is a bat above.
[01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:19.750]  I didn't even have to scroll down.
[01:02:19.850 --> 01:02:20.730]  There's bats right here.
[01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:22.770]  Well, those are wings, but there's a bat right there.
[01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:23.390]  What are you talking about?
[01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:24.510]  There's bats in the picture.
[01:02:25.210 --> 01:02:26.430]  Oh, I didn't even see them.
[01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:27.330]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:28.070]  I didn't see it.
[01:02:28.330 --> 01:02:29.410]  There's bats in the picture.
[01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:30.610]  There's a bat in this one.
[01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:32.130]  Clearly bat focused.
[01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:33.570]  That's bats right there on the left.
[01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:36.490]  It's much smaller what we can see than what you can see.
[01:02:36.490 --> 01:02:37.930]  No, I understand.
[01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:38.990]  I understand.
[01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:39.530]  It's just...
[01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:43.210]  The bat ratio is a lot lower though with vampire.
[01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:47.210]  I just don't know what else you would search to not see bats.
[01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:48.690]  Nick wants you to try Bing.
[01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:49.650]  Try Bing.
[01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:52.250]  Bing, not bats.
[01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:53.550]  Bing, not bats.
[01:02:54.890 --> 01:02:56.550]  Okay, you want me to search not bats?
[01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:57.590]  Not bats.
[01:02:58.830 --> 01:02:59.210]  Okay.
[01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:00.470]  Okay.
[01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:01.230]  Okay.
[01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:01.690]  Yeah!
[01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:03.830]  But there's bats.
[01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:04.930]  It's very different.
[01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:07.170]  It's just a not...
[01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:09.130]  Like it's a sign that says no bats, essentially.
[01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:11.750]  Why would the sign ever say no bats?
[01:03:12.130 --> 01:03:14.510]  Wouldn't the sign say like warning bats?
[01:03:15.790 --> 01:03:18.130]  There's seven vampires that aren't bats.
[01:03:19.350 --> 01:03:20.570]  These are all bats.
[01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:21.530]  Yeah.
[01:03:22.650 --> 01:03:23.430]  This one's mad.
[01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:25.310]  Are mosquitoes vampires?
[01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:26.250]  Probably.
[01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:27.730]  I blame this on...
[01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:28.930]  I blame this on AI.
[01:03:29.570 --> 01:03:30.970]  It's all ChatGPT's fault.
[01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:31.230]  I'm with Jeff.
[01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:31.990]  I'm with Jeff.
[01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:33.450]  Yeah, I can suck it.
[01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:35.890]  Are mosquitoes vampires?
[01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:37.310]  Are bats mosquitoes?
[01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:39.650]  No, mosquitoes are not vampires.
[01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:40.050]  Bummer.
[01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:40.590]  Why?
[01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:45.370]  While mosquitoes do suck blood, they are not obligated...
[01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:49.010]  Wait, they are not obligate blood suckers.
[01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:50.570]  I guess it's just for their babies.
[01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:53.130]  Meaning they can get nutrients from other sources.
[01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:53.910]  Like what?
[01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:55.230]  They drink nectar?
[01:03:55.610 --> 01:03:56.510]  Oh, weird.
[01:03:56.790 --> 01:03:57.990]  Yeah, they just drink nectar, I think.
[01:03:57.990 --> 01:04:02.730]  But then if the female is making eggs, it needs mammal blood or something.
[01:04:03.350 --> 01:04:03.390]  Crazy.
[01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:06.090]  So I've been staking them in the heart for no reason?
[01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:09.150]  Shit.
[01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:10.610]  Jeff, wrap us up.
[01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:11.230]  Get us out of here.
[01:04:11.290 --> 01:04:11.970]  We have to go.
[01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:14.750]  Does a vampire have to live on blood to be a vampire?
[01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:16.490]  Yeah, exclusively, right?
[01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:19.830]  Is a vampire blood obligate?
[01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:22.190]  Don't we all live on blood at a technical level?
[01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:24.410]  Research indicates...
[01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:25.670]  Oh, this is about vampire bats.
[01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:30.690]  Yes, vampire bats are obligate blood-eating mammals.
[01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:33.670]  So I would assume that vampires' normal style are.
[01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:34.170]  Okay.
[01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:34.870]  There you go.
[01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:35.950]  Well, there you go.
[01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:37.810]  It sounds like it's time for me to wrap this up.
[01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:42.710]  I'd like to leave y'all with a thought, something to take into your lives after you...
[01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:46.090]  to leave the podcast with to think about for the rest of the week.
[01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:49.570]  Maybe it'll help you through something in your life.
[01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:50.650]  I was thinking...
[01:04:50.650 --> 01:04:51.710]  I was listening to Howard Stern the other day.
[01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:55.830]  He was talking about how he used to jack off to girdle ads all the time in the newspaper.
[01:04:55.830 --> 01:05:01.310]  And it reminded me that when we were kids, we would always jack off to Sears catalogs, right?
[01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:04.910]  And then now the porn is so much more plentiful with the internet.
[01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:09.730]  And technology has really improved that.
[01:05:09.850 --> 01:05:11.270]  But I was taking it back the other way.
[01:05:11.350 --> 01:05:14.070]  I thought, man, it's so much easier to jerk off to stuff than it used to be.
[01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:15.790]  Howard had to do it in girdle ads.
[01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:16.890]  What was worse than that?
[01:05:17.090 --> 01:05:17.930]  And I realized...
[01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:20.870]  I was thinking about when I was walking around your castles in England, Gavin,
[01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:22.410]  and they had tapestries everywhere.
[01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:24.850]  And those were like the TVs of the day.
[01:05:24.850 --> 01:05:28.030]  So do you think back in the day when people hung out in castles,
[01:05:28.070 --> 01:05:30.310]  do you think they ever jerked off to their tapestries?
[01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:33.950]  You know, there's like a guy in town who has the dirtiest taps.
[01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:34.550]  Yeah.
[01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:35.070]  Yeah.
[01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:35.610]  You just like...
[01:05:35.610 --> 01:05:36.170]  You roll out...
[01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:38.750]  Like your wife goes out of town for the weekend to visit her sister,
[01:05:38.790 --> 01:05:41.370]  and you roll out a tapestry and hang it up on the wall in your bedroom,
[01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:43.210]  and you just beat it furiously.
[01:05:43.590 --> 01:05:45.590]  They're all double-sided, and he just spins them around.
[01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:49.470]  Do you have tapestries that are like...
[01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:50.970]  They get crusty and hard, you know?
[01:05:51.110 --> 01:05:52.430]  You get a little close up to them.
[01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.830]  Anyway...
[01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:57.170]  If you had to, for a week, let's say a month,
[01:05:57.250 --> 01:06:01.190]  you could only monk off to pre-1800s porn.
[01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:01.970]  Could you do it?
[01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:03.070]  I don't like Monk Off.
[01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:06.870]  I think that was the subtitle of one of the Alvin the Chipmunk's reboots.
[01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:09.270]  I believe it was...
[01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:10.830]  The second one was Monk Off.
[01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:16.290]  I'm imagining taking it further back at cave paintings.
[01:06:16.790 --> 01:06:20.730]  Take that into your personal life and see how you can apply it to your day-to-day.
[01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:23.050]  And we'll see you right back here next week
[01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:25.270]  for another episode of The Regulation Podcast.
[01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:27.390]  Coming at you in 2025.
[01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:35.250]  Is a tick a vampire?
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:47.140]  Ticks, real-life vampires, according to Science for Georgia.
