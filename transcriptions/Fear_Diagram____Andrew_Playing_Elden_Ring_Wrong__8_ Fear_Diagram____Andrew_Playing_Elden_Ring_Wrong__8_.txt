[00:26.000 --> 00:32.670]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:33.010 --> 00:38.090]  My name is Jeff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Frey, Nick Schwartz,
[00:38.230 --> 00:43.470]  Eric Bedore. It's the Regulation Crew and Egg, as you might also know us here.
[00:43.470 --> 00:46.130]  Oh my God. With episode eight of our podcast,
[00:46.210 --> 00:47.650]  The Regulation Podcast. Hello.
[00:47.990 --> 00:50.190]  How's everyone doing? Fucking great.
[00:50.350 --> 00:51.810]  Y'all good? Yeah, man.
[00:52.510 --> 00:54.650]  Good. I'm glad.
[00:55.330 --> 00:56.690]  It didn't seem like y'all were great earlier.
[00:56.690 --> 00:59.670]  There's some gameplay. There's some...
[00:59.670 --> 01:02.870]  We recorded maybe a chain-based video game today.
[01:03.450 --> 01:07.030]  I watched. I would say the vibes were not the best.
[01:07.230 --> 01:11.410]  Eric, do you think it'd be worse to play that game again or to be chained together in real life?
[01:12.110 --> 01:14.410]  I'd rather be chained together in real life.
[01:14.810 --> 01:18.510]  Because then if we fall from those heights, at least I just die.
[01:18.970 --> 01:20.750]  And I don't have to do it again.
[01:21.170 --> 01:25.290]  Alright, here's a video idea. What if we all chain ourselves together
[01:25.290 --> 01:28.690]  and then we have to navigate like a playground?
[01:29.870 --> 01:32.430]  This is... we're like becoming... we can't...
[01:32.430 --> 01:34.910]  This is like becoming Mr. Beast. Like, is that what we're doing?
[01:35.010 --> 01:36.810]  Is that who we are? No, because it's not going to make any money.
[01:38.890 --> 01:43.870]  You think Mr. Beast is chaining himself to other people and then going to a playground?
[01:43.870 --> 01:48.330]  No, no. I think he's paying people $150,000 to be chained together.
[01:48.730 --> 01:51.950]  Yeah, but somehow it plants trees, so it all washes out okay.
[01:51.950 --> 01:56.310]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It helps people fix their glasses in a country you've never heard of.
[01:56.510 --> 01:59.250]  Exactly. What about a regulation chocolate bar
[01:59.250 --> 02:01.890]  is like at the start of the playground in the middle. We got to go get it.
[02:02.550 --> 02:06.490]  Really bring it together. Maybe a regulation hamburger.
[02:07.050 --> 02:09.630]  Gavin, would you rather play that game again or be chained together in real life?
[02:09.870 --> 02:13.450]  Probably the real life thing because that actually sounds also like it would be fun.
[02:14.830 --> 02:18.310]  No, no, it would not be. Y'all would kill each other.
[02:18.310 --> 02:26.090]  As someone who just got to observe, I don't think I've ever seen Nick be so angry at people.
[02:26.390 --> 02:30.550]  It was great. It was the first time. It was the first appearance of angry Nick.
[02:31.010 --> 02:32.870]  Yeah, I really liked it, I think. No.
[02:34.750 --> 02:40.450]  Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. There's one person in particular
[02:40.450 --> 02:43.370]  was getting under Nick's skin. I don't want to spoil it.
[02:44.750 --> 02:47.530]  Who was it? It wasn't me. It wasn't Gavin.
[02:47.530 --> 02:51.810]  I'm not going to say who it was, but it wasn't me and it wasn't Gavin.
[02:52.130 --> 02:56.990]  Maybe we'll chuck that in one of our Patreon polls and people can vote for it against something else.
[02:57.210 --> 02:59.410]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Or should that be public?
[02:59.630 --> 03:03.690]  It seems like a pretty popular game right now, right? Like I see it all over TikTok.
[03:04.230 --> 03:06.510]  Dump it out on YouTube then? Yeah, dump them out.
[03:06.610 --> 03:09.710]  I suppose so. I just don't know... oh, dump them out?
[03:09.830 --> 03:13.390]  Well, I just don't know why jumping decisions were made at certain times. That's all.
[03:13.510 --> 03:15.590]  It's just, you know, that's all. That's all I'm saying.
[03:15.590 --> 03:17.430]  Yeah, good question. And Nick agrees.
[03:17.670 --> 03:18.390]  Yeah, why'd you do it?
[03:21.970 --> 03:32.290]  Oh, well, what do you guys want to talk about today that's not just reminiscing over a video
[03:32.290 --> 03:36.910]  game we just played that nobody saw us play yet? I would like to ask Eric if he's
[03:37.470 --> 03:40.990]  done any detective work on who his information leak is.
[03:41.290 --> 03:45.190]  Yeah, I have and I don't have it yet. I still don't have an information leak on
[03:45.190 --> 03:50.530]  where my fear came from. We talked about it the other day while we were swimming in the pool
[03:50.530 --> 03:53.690]  and I accused our friend Alyssa, who immediately went,
[03:53.770 --> 03:57.050]  I don't know anything about this. She didn't know anything about it.
[03:58.070 --> 03:59.430]  I told you it wasn't her.
[04:00.470 --> 04:02.130]  Right, and I didn't believe you.
[04:04.930 --> 04:07.590]  I just don't know who it would have been.
[04:08.230 --> 04:11.630]  I hope you figure it out soon, Eric, because it's becoming a prominent
[04:12.370 --> 04:15.530]  form of discussion in all swimmies these days. Although I gotta say,
[04:15.870 --> 04:19.350]  it did spawn a hell of an idea.
[04:19.990 --> 04:24.190]  Yeah, Andrew, are you aware of a five-way Venn diagram?
[04:25.010 --> 04:25.430]  No.
[04:26.010 --> 04:34.210]  So in a five-way Venn diagram, there are overlaps. And after talking with our friend Alyssa the other
[04:34.210 --> 04:38.550]  day, we started talking about it was this conversation of who do you think the leak
[04:38.550 --> 04:41.170]  was and then going around in a circle and I said, I just don't know who
[04:42.350 --> 04:49.370]  knows what my fear is of like the blood pressure cuff. And then I'm like, well, it's just like
[04:49.370 --> 04:52.690]  knowing, you know, Jeff's fear of snakes, whatever. And then Alyssa was like, yeah,
[04:52.730 --> 04:57.690]  and then I guess if there was like a boa constrictor, that would be like the worst of
[04:57.690 --> 05:04.070]  both worlds for you. And thus was born the fear diagram. And we need to figure out
[05:04.070 --> 05:11.130]  what all of our overlapping fears would be to get to the middle, which is the ultimate regulation
[05:11.130 --> 05:16.250]  fear. That's really funny. It's very tough to figure out the fear diagram.
[05:16.670 --> 05:21.010]  So the boa constrictor would be the perfect blend between Eric's fear of being squeezed and
[05:21.010 --> 05:26.830]  Jeff's fear of snakes. And then we discussed also that Nick was potentially afraid of flying
[05:26.830 --> 05:30.670]  and then Alyssa immediately screamed snakes on a plane. So that would be
[05:30.670 --> 05:35.470]  the blend between Jeff and Nick.
[05:37.270 --> 05:38.530]  That's really funny.
[05:38.530 --> 05:41.970]  The thing we were lost on was what's Andrew's fear? What is yours, Andrew?
[05:42.370 --> 05:46.510]  I mean, I talked about that like surgical scenes in movies get me.
[05:47.570 --> 05:50.190]  But that's like so specific. I don't know.
[05:50.350 --> 05:53.050]  Is it the blood or the cutting or?
[05:53.370 --> 05:55.890]  I don't know. I don't know what it is.
[05:56.010 --> 06:00.270]  So maybe like a gallbladder surgery on a snake would be a good blend.
[06:01.450 --> 06:05.330]  But here's the thing with the five-way Venn diagram that we're looking at
[06:05.930 --> 06:11.410]  is that not everyone overlaps AB. So if you look, if I'm at the top at B
[06:12.110 --> 06:19.410]  and Jeff is at the left side at A, I don't necessarily have a singular overlap with E
[06:19.410 --> 06:24.430]  who could potentially be Andrew. We would have to figure out what the ABE is.
[06:24.770 --> 06:27.110]  The least overlaps would have to sit kind of opposite each other.
[06:27.430 --> 06:31.390]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's that's tough. But you still have to find the overlap
[06:31.390 --> 06:34.610]  between yourself, one other person and the other person.
[06:34.810 --> 06:38.290]  Like there's a bunch of overlaps that exist there.
[06:38.370 --> 06:41.110]  And I think we really get I think it starts getting muddy
[06:41.110 --> 06:43.930]  when you start tripling up on like wet bread.
[06:44.790 --> 06:46.590]  Yeah, pressure cuffing snake.
[06:47.250 --> 06:51.290]  I think we just have to I think I don't think that the fear diagram is something
[06:51.290 --> 06:54.210]  that you can 100 percent fill out in one sitting.
[06:54.370 --> 06:57.450]  I think we we we plug in as we go. You know what I mean?
[06:57.450 --> 07:03.430]  Yeah, I don't. I also really like that there's an ABCDE overlap of all five people.
[07:03.750 --> 07:05.810]  Yeah, which is surely just death.
[07:06.270 --> 07:08.450]  Like is there is there going to be anything more specific than that?
[07:08.710 --> 07:11.350]  I'm not scared. But yours isn't death. Yours is wet bread.
[07:11.870 --> 07:13.390]  You don't die from wet bread.
[07:14.750 --> 07:16.710]  I actually think Diane's going to be OK.
[07:18.590 --> 07:20.030]  Are you looking forward to it?
[07:20.290 --> 07:23.330]  I'm not looking forward to it, but I'm not super scared of it. I've decided.
[07:24.190 --> 07:25.010]  Oh, cool.
[07:26.550 --> 07:30.590]  I think I don't know. I think I think I'll get to do something else after.
[07:31.110 --> 07:33.570]  I feel like it's the first thing I think about every morning.
[07:34.210 --> 07:35.170]  What? Death?
[07:35.890 --> 07:39.570]  Or just like being scared of it, maybe for like 10 seconds, right?
[07:39.830 --> 07:44.450]  Right. As I wake up and then I and then after 10 seconds, I'm like, oh, let's have a day.
[07:44.830 --> 07:49.250]  Gavin. OK, Gavin, I think you might be more scared of that than bread, buddy.
[07:51.170 --> 07:56.650]  If it's the first thing you think of every day and you have to talk yourself off the ledge so that you can have a day.
[07:57.010 --> 08:02.310]  I'm not on any ledge. I just feel like it's it's the constant reminder of how much time has passed.
[08:03.870 --> 08:05.970]  About six hours since you fell asleep.
[08:08.230 --> 08:11.970]  I roll out of bed thinking Johnny Caviar. That's where my brain goes.
[08:12.390 --> 08:17.110]  Like I've never the fear of death is not a thing I've woken up with.
[08:17.190 --> 08:17.850]  Not worried about it?
[08:18.550 --> 08:20.690]  Nah, it feels like inevitability.
[08:22.070 --> 08:24.250]  Yeah, I guess there's no point thinking about it.
[08:29.160 --> 08:34.640]  Anyway, I'm excited for us to fill out our fear diagram as as we unlock new fears and discover
[08:34.640 --> 08:38.520]  connections. Snakes on a Plane, I thought was very funny. Snakes on a Plane is very funny.
[08:39.000 --> 08:43.520]  I don't think I'm afraid of heights, but when I visited the Capitol Building in Austin,
[08:44.060 --> 08:47.060]  I definitely felt something looking down from high above.
[08:47.060 --> 08:50.220]  But I don't know if that's height specific.
[08:50.780 --> 08:51.620]  A little vertigo, maybe?
[08:51.800 --> 08:53.240]  Being high and looking down just like...
[08:53.240 --> 08:55.940]  That's only like three floors up, isn't it? Four floors?
[08:56.000 --> 08:56.800]  They're big floors, though.
[08:57.280 --> 09:00.060]  They're really big to look down from the top.
[09:00.520 --> 09:02.120]  Andrew, what's the highest you've been?
[09:03.160 --> 09:05.320]  Whoa, what a question.
[09:06.300 --> 09:12.420]  Probably like a hotel, probably like 25 floors up, something like that.
[09:12.940 --> 09:15.580]  OK, so you've been like probably 25 floors up.
[09:16.660 --> 09:17.640]  Probably, yeah.
[09:17.880 --> 09:18.860]  That doesn't bother me.
[09:18.960 --> 09:20.500]  Like looking at a window from there.
[09:21.060 --> 09:23.180]  OK, what about a glass floor?
[09:24.060 --> 09:26.940]  Well, I feel like a glass floor is like...
[09:27.720 --> 09:30.100]  I think I'd be OK with it, I'd assume.
[09:30.380 --> 09:34.680]  But there'd probably be some amount of queasiness walking onto it initially.
[09:36.640 --> 09:40.280]  I feel like it's sort of maybe like when you jump off a high thing into like a lake,
[09:40.440 --> 09:42.600]  you know, where like that first jump kind of scary.
[09:42.620 --> 09:43.860]  Then after that, it's fine.
[09:43.860 --> 09:47.260]  I think that first step is probably pretty queasy.
[09:47.420 --> 09:49.820]  And then once you're on the floor, it's like, whatever, I'm just standing.
[09:50.260 --> 09:51.400]  Have you done a lot of cliff diving?
[09:52.600 --> 09:55.160]  I've jumped a few, a little bit of cliff diving.
[09:56.500 --> 09:59.180]  Not from high cliffs, but I've jumped off a cliff.
[10:00.880 --> 10:01.940]  I just don't...
[10:02.960 --> 10:05.800]  Now, I don't know what your definition of cliff is,
[10:05.820 --> 10:07.880]  but I bet it's really different from what I'm picturing.
[10:08.140 --> 10:09.700]  Yeah, oh, it's definitely different.
[10:09.700 --> 10:12.080]  You're probably picturing some like,
[10:12.420 --> 10:16.280]  Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid level of cliff jump.
[10:16.460 --> 10:17.920]  Are you just talking about like a riverbank?
[10:18.680 --> 10:21.300]  Uh, well, what are you picturing with a riverbank?
[10:21.500 --> 10:22.300]  Let's give us a height.
[10:22.780 --> 10:24.960]  From where you jump to where you hit the water.
[10:25.260 --> 10:28.120]  You're asking the Dinklages guy to give you a height?
[10:28.320 --> 10:29.660]  I got no clue.
[10:30.160 --> 10:33.260]  Is it more than, is it more than one Andrew?
[10:33.960 --> 10:35.460]  Oh, way more than one Andrew.
[10:35.700 --> 10:36.960]  No, yeah, it's less than that.
[10:36.960 --> 10:41.240]  It's less than whatever, whatever that is that you just shared.
[10:42.580 --> 10:43.620]  That's really tall.
[10:44.580 --> 10:48.160]  Yeah, that guy looks like he jumped off the highest place on earth.
[10:48.480 --> 10:51.260]  Yeah, like you posted a cliff that we can't see the total height of.
[10:51.980 --> 10:54.400]  No, but that's how I picture Andrew cliff diving.
[10:57.140 --> 10:59.940]  Let me see if I can, I can find this cliff.
[11:00.480 --> 11:01.320]  Oh, that'd be awesome.
[11:01.900 --> 11:04.640]  You keep calling it a cliff and there's just no shot.
[11:04.800 --> 11:06.380]  Like there's no chance it's a cliff.
[11:06.380 --> 11:08.280]  Like there's no chance it's a cliff.
[11:08.480 --> 11:13.380]  I think it's probably the lowest technical cliff you can ask.
[11:13.680 --> 11:14.900]  How low could a cliff be?
[11:15.480 --> 11:18.000]  What's the lowest cliff?
[11:18.360 --> 11:23.080]  I think if you look at it, it's undeniably a cliff, but it's like, it's not.
[11:23.520 --> 11:25.460]  That is the shortest cliff.
[11:29.180 --> 11:31.180]  Smallest cliff in the world.
[11:31.560 --> 11:31.780]  How small?
[11:33.200 --> 11:34.580]  Oh, it's just stupid answers.
[11:34.580 --> 11:36.400]  Someone just said a curb is a cliff to ants.
[11:36.580 --> 11:38.440]  OK, well, well, that's right.
[11:38.520 --> 11:42.140]  That's what I mean by Andrew, though, is that that's what I think he's getting at.
[11:42.460 --> 11:43.400]  Did you have you?
[11:43.460 --> 11:43.760]  How are you?
[11:43.760 --> 11:44.800]  How's the search for your cliff?
[11:44.860 --> 11:45.780]  I think I found it.
[11:46.440 --> 11:47.540]  I think I got it.
[11:48.120 --> 11:48.840]  Save image.
[11:51.520 --> 11:52.500]  Is that it?
[11:53.660 --> 11:55.320]  I haven't been there in a long time.
[11:55.720 --> 11:56.640]  Well, I don't know.
[11:56.960 --> 11:57.240]  How old were you?
[11:57.320 --> 11:58.980]  How old were you when this happened?
[12:00.780 --> 12:04.180]  Probably like 2006, I'd say.
[12:04.180 --> 12:07.200]  OK, my last cliff jump.
[12:08.120 --> 12:14.360]  I don't know if because this definitely they didn't have this bridge above this cliff.
[12:14.840 --> 12:19.260]  I have to save the photo.
[12:21.160 --> 12:23.540]  Drag it, drop it, drag it.
[12:23.640 --> 12:25.380]  How would I drag it and drop it?
[12:25.700 --> 12:27.660]  Drag it, drag it, then drop it.
[12:28.160 --> 12:31.220]  I I right click copy and then right click paste.
[12:31.280 --> 12:32.420]  And it just it goes for me.
[12:32.560 --> 12:33.100]  You can do that, too.
[12:33.100 --> 12:33.400]  Really?
[12:33.920 --> 12:36.940]  I thought you had to save the image to like your your phone.
[12:37.160 --> 12:38.360]  We're never going to see this fucking cliff.
[12:38.520 --> 12:40.020]  He's never going to send the cliff.
[12:40.760 --> 12:41.580]  Oh, my God.
[12:42.180 --> 12:44.000]  I'm painting a beautiful picture of words.
[12:44.220 --> 12:47.200]  This is a click and drag.
[12:47.320 --> 12:48.480]  I click and drag.
[12:48.500 --> 12:49.120]  It's click and drag.
[12:49.400 --> 12:53.360]  I would love to be able to paint drag just using his words like based on.
[12:53.640 --> 12:54.340]  Oh, is that it?
[12:54.880 --> 12:55.560]  Oh, wait.
[12:56.800 --> 12:58.500]  I clicked it and I dragged it.
[12:58.620 --> 12:59.200]  Nothing happened.
[12:59.380 --> 13:00.240]  What do you want?
[13:01.600 --> 13:02.240]  Click drag.
[13:04.760 --> 13:06.000]  And then I go in here.
[13:07.500 --> 13:11.240]  This is going to be one of those episodes where people are mad at Andrew in the first 10 minutes.
[13:11.940 --> 13:15.540]  Wait, no, I clicked the drag that just took me to a website.
[13:15.680 --> 13:16.480]  It changed the website.
[13:18.640 --> 13:19.380]  Oh, I got it.
[13:19.460 --> 13:20.440]  It's in my it's in my folder.
[13:20.740 --> 13:21.400]  I just have to go back.
[13:21.540 --> 13:23.080]  OK, you ready for this cliff?
[13:23.160 --> 13:24.080]  I mean, this is not a podcast.
[13:24.360 --> 13:24.500]  Yeah.
[13:25.400 --> 13:26.660]  Gavin, you guys ready for this one?
[13:26.920 --> 13:27.700]  I think so.
[13:27.800 --> 13:28.760]  OK, that's the cliff.
[13:29.000 --> 13:29.860]  This sucks.
[13:30.240 --> 13:30.940]  Right there.
[13:32.680 --> 13:33.800]  Oh, that's that.
[13:34.060 --> 13:36.500]  That water doesn't look deep enough to jump into.
[13:36.640 --> 13:37.840]  No, it doesn't.
[13:40.560 --> 13:41.000]  That's...
[13:41.000 --> 13:42.760]  Were you at least on the upper level?
[13:43.760 --> 13:44.880]  The bridge thing?
[13:44.940 --> 13:46.780]  No, that didn't exist last time I was there.
[13:47.040 --> 13:48.540]  The right side cliff.
[13:48.580 --> 13:52.920]  Right side cliff, upper level where it kind of pokes out like a finger or a toe.
[13:53.660 --> 13:54.700]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:54.740 --> 13:54.920]  OK.
[13:55.300 --> 13:59.500]  Not really a lot there for scale, but I assume the fence on the bridge is a human height.
[14:00.780 --> 14:01.580]  Probably, yeah.
[14:02.300 --> 14:03.020]  Uh, yeah.
[14:03.180 --> 14:04.380]  But it's further away.
[14:04.720 --> 14:07.020]  At least like maybe four feet tall.
[14:08.500 --> 14:11.620]  It's... it's probably like two shacks, I'd say.
[14:11.920 --> 14:12.720]  Can you draw...
[14:13.440 --> 14:16.800]  Can you draw the size of a human on the tip of the bit you jump off?
[14:17.860 --> 14:18.220]  Oh, sure.
[14:18.300 --> 14:18.580]  Or...
[14:18.580 --> 14:20.180]  Yeah, yeah, that'd be awesome if you could do that.
[14:20.200 --> 14:20.560]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:20.680 --> 14:21.000]  I'll do that.
[14:21.480 --> 14:22.540]  Like how big you were.
[14:23.200 --> 14:26.640]  While Andrew's doing that, I want to show you guys a picture of something that I did today.
[14:26.680 --> 14:28.560]  Not a big deal or anything, but I thought I'd share it with you guys.
[14:29.060 --> 14:30.920]  Because it's been a long time ago.
[14:30.920 --> 14:31.420]  Is it going to be a tool of Cliff?
[14:31.940 --> 14:32.200]  No.
[14:33.040 --> 14:34.060]  It's what I did today.
[14:36.020 --> 14:37.360]  Oh, you did it!
[14:37.460 --> 14:39.180]  No way! The footrest!
[14:39.540 --> 14:40.620]  No more footrest, huh?
[14:40.760 --> 14:42.880]  I tried to set up the PS5.
[14:43.060 --> 14:43.460]  Wow.
[14:45.320 --> 14:45.660]  I tried.
[14:45.680 --> 14:47.000]  But you didn't... you didn't manage it?
[14:47.900 --> 14:52.460]  There's some sort of a problem where it says the controller's battery isn't charged enough
[14:52.460 --> 14:54.820]  to allow me to update the firmware to use it.
[14:54.860 --> 14:55.920]  So I can't sign in.
[14:56.180 --> 14:58.240]  And I was reading about it on Reddit and it's like an issue.
[14:58.240 --> 15:01.180]  So I'm trying some fixes, but I ran out of time before the podcast started.
[15:02.920 --> 15:05.740]  Yeah, I guess most people don't buy one and then leave it for two years.
[15:06.120 --> 15:09.980]  I realized, Gavin, as I was opening it up, and I really opened it up, like the clear
[15:09.980 --> 15:13.320]  like stickers were on it that I had to pop open so I could actually get into it.
[15:13.420 --> 15:16.760]  And I realized I don't actually know there's a PS5 in here.
[15:16.980 --> 15:22.160]  If Gavin put like, I don't know, a pile of turds in here or cucumbers or something,
[15:22.680 --> 15:25.640]  that would be the longest play of the joke ever.
[15:25.640 --> 15:28.580]  And I was genuinely a little nervous opening it up.
[15:28.760 --> 15:29.880]  Like, what if?
[15:29.920 --> 15:30.440]  Oh, my God.
[15:30.500 --> 15:31.400]  What if he's about to get me?
[15:31.720 --> 15:32.500]  But it was just a PS5.
[15:32.760 --> 15:35.160]  It's just a PS5 that doesn't quite work.
[15:39.280 --> 15:41.300]  We had some homework this week, didn't we?
[15:41.920 --> 15:42.720]  We sure did.
[15:43.040 --> 15:43.760]  We did.
[15:44.160 --> 15:45.080]  We had grocery items.
[15:46.040 --> 15:49.620]  So here, uh, let me, uh, here's here's a photo.
[15:50.260 --> 15:52.400]  Yeah, I'd say of height, roughly.
[15:53.420 --> 15:54.200]  There you go.
[15:55.640 --> 15:56.860]  Nice little image for you.
[15:57.180 --> 15:58.080]  That's you, is it?
[15:58.700 --> 15:59.400]  Yeah, that's me.
[15:59.680 --> 16:00.920]  That's me, 2006.
[16:01.560 --> 16:03.820]  Like a 10 foot drop, 12 feet.
[16:04.560 --> 16:08.320]  And now I found a photo of people jumping off of it.
[16:09.000 --> 16:09.720]  Even better.
[16:10.140 --> 16:10.820]  Even better.
[16:11.240 --> 16:11.940]  Top down.
[16:12.880 --> 16:15.320]  So you see, like, it is a cliff.
[16:15.880 --> 16:20.720]  But as I said, I think it's probably technically the smallest cliff you could have.
[16:20.980 --> 16:22.540]  I, I, I agree with that.
[16:22.540 --> 16:27.580]  I think what you've done is, uh, you've highlighted the Canadian art of ledge jumping.
[16:29.800 --> 16:30.960]  Is it Canadian art?
[16:32.180 --> 16:33.300]  Our great pride?
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.880]  I've never seen ledges like that in America.
[16:36.160 --> 16:36.820]  That's interesting.
[16:37.240 --> 16:37.920]  It's fun.
[16:38.260 --> 16:39.200]  Is that close to where you live?
[16:39.340 --> 16:40.500]  Could you go there today if you wanted to?
[16:41.420 --> 16:45.220]  Uh, it'd probably be like a 90 minute drive, maybe a little less.
[16:45.360 --> 16:46.580]  Maybe like 80 minutes to get there.
[16:46.680 --> 16:47.220]  It's not too far.
[16:47.620 --> 16:49.880]  So if we came up in the dead of summer, we could all go swimming there.
[16:50.440 --> 16:50.940]  Oh, absolutely.
[16:51.180 --> 16:51.380]  Yeah.
[16:53.160 --> 16:58.300]  The last time I think I went there, I rode down because it's like a little bit of a river, sort of.
[16:58.880 --> 17:03.600]  Uh, I just rode down and I beat the shit out of my back because I just, I don't know.
[17:03.860 --> 17:06.360]  I thought I was immune to damage, I guess.
[17:07.320 --> 17:08.860]  And, uh, haven't been since.
[17:09.760 --> 17:12.140]  Like your back was too long for the, the bumps?
[17:12.720 --> 17:16.840]  Uh, like, I just, I absorbed too hard of blows, I guess.
[17:16.880 --> 17:18.200]  I was like, I'm in the water.
[17:18.340 --> 17:19.220]  This is fine.
[17:19.320 --> 17:20.700]  I'm not going to be, this is great.
[17:20.700 --> 17:24.940]  And then I got out of the water and my back was cut up and like bruised.
[17:25.060 --> 17:28.540]  So, oh, it's been a while, but the jump is good.
[17:28.580 --> 17:28.940]  It's fine.
[17:28.980 --> 17:29.680]  The jump is easy.
[17:30.560 --> 17:34.340]  Any idea what the, uh, the river crabbing situation is like over there?
[17:34.620 --> 17:39.160]  I don't think there's a lot of crabs, uh, in, in that scenario.
[17:39.420 --> 17:39.560]  Yeah.
[17:40.700 --> 17:42.500]  Yeah, it's not a great crab.
[17:42.600 --> 17:44.280]  Two birds, you know, trying to, you know.
[17:44.380 --> 17:45.300]  No, I appreciate it.
[17:45.360 --> 17:45.560]  Yeah.
[17:46.120 --> 17:51.060]  You could maybe hold the crab trap in your hands and ride down the river and see if you
[17:51.060 --> 17:53.200]  can scoop up anything on the lap.
[17:53.280 --> 17:58.740]  It'd be fun to, to fly up and do an, uh, an old fashioned cliff and crab as they call it.
[17:59.760 --> 18:00.280]  Yeah.
[18:00.860 --> 18:02.560]  As they call it in Canada.
[18:03.100 --> 18:03.380]  Yeah.
[18:04.280 --> 18:05.400]  Great Canadian practice.
[18:06.360 --> 18:08.540]  Make your next vacation unforgettable.
[18:09.220 --> 18:12.700]  On Royal Caribbean's newest ship, Star of the Seas.

[18:51.300 --> 18:52.580]  But our homework.
[18:53.560 --> 18:54.760]  How do we want to do this?
[18:54.820 --> 18:57.180]  Do we want to submit our little stories?
[18:57.320 --> 18:59.920]  Well, I think the idea is that we would do our stories and then
[18:59.920 --> 19:02.980]  people would have to try and guess which three things we had to buy.
[19:03.820 --> 19:04.220]  Okay.
[19:04.460 --> 19:04.820]  Okay.
[19:05.280 --> 19:06.580]  You don't, do you want me to go first?
[19:06.740 --> 19:07.040]  Do you want me to?
[19:07.060 --> 19:07.260]  Sure.
[19:07.360 --> 19:08.260]  Andrew, do you want to go first?
[19:08.260 --> 19:09.720]  I'm going to go first.
[19:10.260 --> 19:13.340]  There's some pretty big clues for mine.
[19:13.700 --> 19:15.880]  I'd say if you know your stuff,
[19:16.440 --> 19:18.560]  two out of three, very obvious.
[19:18.780 --> 19:21.680]  The third one may be a little bit harder to figure out.
[19:22.580 --> 19:23.520]  Here's my story.
[19:24.880 --> 19:27.940]  Major snap melon proudly serving the dark side.
[19:28.240 --> 19:29.960]  Oven-toasted Greg Hildebrand.
[19:30.680 --> 19:34.320]  In Canada, this suggested destiny is applicable for refund.
[19:40.200 --> 19:44.800]  So if you want to try to parse through that and guess what I got, there's some clues.
[19:45.360 --> 19:45.400]  Right.
[19:50.790 --> 19:52.390]  Some sort of toastable thing.
[19:53.110 --> 19:54.210]  Is one of them soda?
[19:54.410 --> 19:55.210]  Can I guess that?
[19:55.370 --> 19:56.510]  Is one of them like a soda?
[19:56.510 --> 19:57.710]  One of them is a soda.
[19:58.230 --> 19:58.470]  Yeah.
[19:59.290 --> 20:00.090]  You're right about that.
[20:00.350 --> 20:03.270]  Is it caffeinated or is it a carbonated soda?
[20:03.570 --> 20:04.930]  It is a carbonated soda.
[20:06.050 --> 20:07.870]  Are there non-carbonated sodas?
[20:10.330 --> 20:11.450]  Uh, I don't know.
[20:11.630 --> 20:12.490]  I just want to make sure.
[20:12.610 --> 20:13.770]  Like, a lot of people say soda.
[20:13.830 --> 20:14.530]  It could be a lot of things.
[20:14.630 --> 20:15.430]  I just want... I'm just trying to make sure.
[20:15.430 --> 20:16.090]  Okay, fair enough.
[20:16.090 --> 20:17.810]  Yeah, no, I respect.
[20:19.730 --> 20:21.250]  Uh, major snap.
[20:23.870 --> 20:25.230]  Is it Mountain Dew?
[20:26.290 --> 20:26.690]  Yes.
[20:27.330 --> 20:27.730]  Wow.
[20:27.810 --> 20:28.890]  One of them is Mountain Dew.
[20:30.010 --> 20:31.430]  Major melon Mountain Dew.
[20:32.810 --> 20:36.050]  The major snap melon thing led me to soda.
[20:36.270 --> 20:37.250]  And I started looking...
[20:37.250 --> 20:40.850]  I started poking around and Googling, like, what is...
[20:40.850 --> 20:41.810]  What's a melon soda?
[20:41.970 --> 20:43.290]  What's something that's going around?
[20:43.470 --> 20:45.530]  Is it... Is it this major melon Mountain Dew?
[20:45.590 --> 20:47.350]  It is. Yeah, it is the major melon Mountain Dew.
[20:47.670 --> 20:48.430]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[20:48.430 --> 20:49.390]  So, there you go.
[20:49.630 --> 20:50.050]  You got one.
[20:50.050 --> 20:50.810]  That's how I landed on that.
[20:50.950 --> 20:53.010]  All right, Gavin, you guess what the Greg Hildebrandt thing is.
[20:53.070 --> 20:53.290]  Go ahead.
[20:54.410 --> 20:55.330]  But you Googled.
[20:58.540 --> 20:58.880]  Okay.
[20:59.600 --> 21:01.020]  So I can just Google Greg.
[21:01.020 --> 21:01.900]  Oh, are we not supposed to?
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.240]  I... I mean, I was getting soda with major snap melon and then went,
[21:05.300 --> 21:06.300]  what the fuck is that thing?
[21:06.740 --> 21:07.860]  Yeah, are we not supposed to Google?
[21:10.000 --> 21:11.980]  Was that a... Was that a rule I wasn't aware of?
[21:11.980 --> 21:12.220]  I'm sorry.
[21:12.440 --> 21:13.960]  Listen, there were no rules, I don't think.
[21:14.060 --> 21:14.420]  Oh, okay.
[21:14.540 --> 21:16.640]  I don't... I don't think... I... Andrew, I'm with you.
[21:16.760 --> 21:17.640]  I didn't think so either.
[21:17.820 --> 21:19.740]  That's why I Googled, like, what the fuck was that mountain...
[21:19.740 --> 21:21.080]  What... What was that soda flavor?
[21:22.420 --> 21:25.140]  I won't Google any of them going forward, guys.
[21:25.520 --> 21:27.460]  Maybe some sort of toaster strudel.
[21:28.100 --> 21:30.100]  Oh, you're thinking a toaster strudel.
[21:30.880 --> 21:31.260]  Interesting.
[21:32.340 --> 21:36.460]  I think this company may be in that... that world,
[21:36.460 --> 21:38.860]  but it's not a toaster strudel.
[21:39.320 --> 21:39.540]  Okay.
[21:39.620 --> 21:40.020]  I have.
[21:40.380 --> 21:42.480]  Is it the light and dark side Oreos?
[21:43.180 --> 21:45.100]  Yes. Eric's got two.
[21:45.280 --> 21:45.820]  Good lord.
[21:46.000 --> 21:46.440]  Greg Hildebrand.
[21:47.000 --> 21:49.220]  Didn't goo... Didn't need to Google that one.
[21:49.760 --> 21:53.680]  Apparently, Greg Hildebrand is, like, a famous poster artist or something.
[21:55.060 --> 21:57.360]  The dark side part tipped me off.
[21:57.460 --> 22:00.100]  I had to think about what was in stores now, and it's those Oreos.
[22:00.560 --> 22:01.320]  It is.
[22:01.400 --> 22:01.520]  What?
[22:01.920 --> 22:03.220]  You're like a food detective.
[22:03.220 --> 22:08.920]  Yeah, I have 100% Eat, a podcast where we try every new fast food creation to let you know.
[22:08.920 --> 22:10.140]  I don't care about that.
[22:13.680 --> 22:17.180]  You guys are one away, and I will say it is the toughest, I feel like.
[22:17.220 --> 22:20.160]  It has the least amount of words pulled.
[22:20.780 --> 22:21.400]  Is it destiny?
[22:22.200 --> 22:24.060]  No, destiny was part of Oreos.
[22:27.800 --> 22:29.780]  Major oven toasted.
[22:30.200 --> 22:30.880]  Oven toasted.
[22:31.680 --> 22:34.240]  It's in the cereal aisle, I'll say.
[22:35.500 --> 22:37.100]  Help narrow it down a little bit.
[22:37.240 --> 22:37.620]  Pop-tarts.
[22:38.420 --> 22:38.900]  No.
[22:41.260 --> 22:42.520]  I've never had a pop-tart.
[22:42.860 --> 22:43.140]  What?
[22:43.460 --> 22:44.400]  Oh my god.
[22:44.960 --> 22:45.820]  Not a pop-tart guy?
[22:46.140 --> 22:47.160]  Not a pop-tart guy.
[22:48.380 --> 22:50.960]  I ate a pop-tart before we came here to record.
[22:51.340 --> 22:53.000]  That sounds delicious. I'm sure they're good.
[22:53.180 --> 22:54.520]  They're fucking great, dude.
[22:55.700 --> 22:58.660]  Is it like a toasted strudel thing, maybe?
[22:59.000 --> 23:00.440]  No, that's what Gavin said already.
[23:00.440 --> 23:01.400]  Oh, did you?
[23:01.460 --> 23:02.100]  Did you really?
[23:02.440 --> 23:05.380]  Actually, hey, hey, I have a guess. I think I know what it is.
[23:06.400 --> 23:09.540]  Is it a toaster strudel of some kind?
[23:10.100 --> 23:10.340]  Nope.
[23:11.200 --> 23:12.420]  No, it's not, Eric.
[23:13.940 --> 23:16.200]  Rice krispies was my third thing.
[23:17.580 --> 23:18.460]  Snap, crackle, pop.
[23:18.660 --> 23:19.320]  Crackle, pop.
[23:19.660 --> 23:25.160]  And the oven toasted rice krispie treat or something.
[23:25.300 --> 23:28.720]  It says oven toasted rice grain cereal on the front of it.
[23:28.720 --> 23:31.280]  Oh, so that is mine.
[23:31.620 --> 23:33.860]  What about y'all? What is your story?
[23:34.460 --> 23:35.640]  I could paste mine in.
[23:35.940 --> 23:36.360]  Go for it.
[23:36.400 --> 23:36.680]  I love Sears.
[23:38.080 --> 23:42.660]  With precaution, Charlie bounced on the ancient boulder above the volcanic mines,
[23:42.820 --> 23:43.880]  aware of the health hazards.
[23:44.280 --> 23:48.060]  Below is bursting with radiation and is not a well-ventilated environment.
[23:48.480 --> 23:51.280]  Charlie is a professional with the benefits of safety documents.
[23:52.080 --> 23:54.520]  Ash eruptions prevent Charlie's fat grip.
[23:54.740 --> 23:55.840]  The power of nature.
[23:56.120 --> 23:58.520]  Temperature causes Charlie's eyes and hands.
[23:58.520 --> 24:01.080]  Be boiled and damaged by sharp objects.
[24:01.240 --> 24:02.720]  Life cannot be reused.
[24:04.420 --> 24:07.220]  That's fucking awesome.
[24:07.440 --> 24:08.580]  That's real good.
[24:08.880 --> 24:10.820]  Fantastic story, Gavin.
[24:13.460 --> 24:18.100]  It was really hard not to have words like his or like was.
[24:19.480 --> 24:20.760]  Yeah, it was really hard.
[24:21.060 --> 24:24.860]  I didn't have a the and it really made things difficult for me.
[24:26.420 --> 24:30.840]  Um, is it some sort of a like a face mask or something?
[24:31.720 --> 24:32.280]  It's not.
[24:32.520 --> 24:35.120]  One of them has to be soap of some kind.
[24:35.760 --> 24:37.620]  Is it cleaning product?
[24:38.480 --> 24:39.680]  No cleaning product.
[24:39.900 --> 24:40.460]  Old Spice.
[24:40.480 --> 24:41.560]  Is it like cat litter?
[24:43.660 --> 24:48.040]  Where is where is radiation coming from, though?
[24:48.460 --> 24:49.000]  Quinoa.
[24:51.380 --> 24:52.740]  Bursting with radiation.
[24:53.160 --> 24:54.140]  Is it quinoa?
[24:54.140 --> 24:54.740]  Is it?
[24:54.900 --> 24:55.660]  Hang on, I got to guess.
[24:55.780 --> 24:58.000]  Is it toaster strudel of some kind?
[25:00.100 --> 25:00.940]  Sadly not.
[25:01.120 --> 25:04.520]  Is there any like radiation flavor?
[25:04.600 --> 25:05.960]  You don't see radiation used.
[25:06.120 --> 25:11.460]  I think Gavin went to a grocery store and I don't think his stuff is necessarily food.
[25:12.280 --> 25:12.760]  I agree.
[25:13.220 --> 25:19.640]  I think he has stuff here that is makeup based or soap based.
[25:19.880 --> 25:20.220]  Bug bomb.
[25:21.100 --> 25:22.360]  Bug bomb, definitely.
[25:22.360 --> 25:26.120]  He said there's no cleaning products and soap is a cleaning product, so it can't be.
[25:29.060 --> 25:31.560]  Do you think this has anything to do with his yard?
[25:32.180 --> 25:33.260]  Could it be yard stuff?
[25:33.620 --> 25:35.300]  Because he's been a lawn guy recently.
[25:38.060 --> 25:39.520]  So is one of them raid?
[25:39.700 --> 25:40.560]  Like a can of raid?
[25:41.280 --> 25:44.020]  No, there is one food, one non-food thing, though.
[25:44.460 --> 25:45.120]  The other two are food.
[25:45.120 --> 25:45.960]  One kind of.
[25:45.960 --> 25:46.660]  Oh, wow, really?
[25:47.180 --> 25:47.680]  Oh my god.
[25:47.980 --> 25:49.000]  Actually, they're not really food.
[25:49.480 --> 25:49.880]  Oh.
[25:50.420 --> 25:50.960]  You put them in.
[25:51.420 --> 25:52.560]  Is one toothpaste?
[25:54.080 --> 25:54.440]  Damn.
[25:54.680 --> 25:55.580]  What about batteries?
[25:56.020 --> 25:56.460]  In your mouth?
[25:57.020 --> 25:57.440]  Oh, gum?
[25:58.520 --> 25:58.720]  No.
[25:59.500 --> 26:01.040]  All right, should I just post a picture of all three of them?
[26:01.360 --> 26:01.720]  Yeah.
[26:02.300 --> 26:03.340]  Yeah, what the fuck?
[26:03.480 --> 26:04.900]  What's up with Charlie's fat grip?
[26:05.260 --> 26:09.760]  We had tea bags, some salt, and some night trial gloves.
[26:10.660 --> 26:11.380]  Great one.
[26:11.960 --> 26:12.320]  Wow.
[26:12.620 --> 26:12.980]  Oh, salt.
[26:12.980 --> 26:14.080]  That's fantastic.
[26:14.160 --> 26:15.200]  Good work, Gavin.
[26:15.240 --> 26:18.280]  And I think in that picture, you can see most of the words.
[26:18.620 --> 26:21.300]  I did turn it around for a few, I think, but most of the words were in there.
[26:21.860 --> 26:22.220]  Fantastic.
[26:22.220 --> 26:24.660]  And there's all of our bubbly from our Soda Summer.
[26:24.860 --> 26:25.940]  That's true.
[26:26.160 --> 26:27.240]  Half of Soda Summer still...
[26:27.240 --> 26:27.360]  Yeah.
[26:28.080 --> 26:28.780]  And then also...
[26:30.980 --> 26:31.700]  YouTube stuff?
[26:32.720 --> 26:34.080]  Oh, yeah, that's a letter from the...
[26:34.720 --> 26:35.760]  What is the other thing?
[26:35.900 --> 26:36.720]  What's the business card?
[26:37.380 --> 26:38.400]  Oh, yeah, it's an iMac.
[26:38.520 --> 26:40.240]  Yeah, well, maybe I'll crop that.
[26:40.640 --> 26:42.400]  Yeah, I think maybe that might be the way, right?
[26:42.680 --> 26:43.480]  Wait, we didn't do that.
[26:44.300 --> 26:47.040]  We better do it soon because Geoff is just going to post this picture.
[26:47.040 --> 26:51.200]  I won't remember that in a week when I'm hanging out out of town on vacation.
[26:51.200 --> 26:52.160]  Delete that now.
[26:52.380 --> 26:53.660]  Yeah, just get rid of it right now.
[26:53.740 --> 26:56.080]  Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[26:56.340 --> 26:58.180]  And finally, Geoff, go ahead.
[26:58.360 --> 27:00.280]  Okay, I'm going to post it and then I'll read it out loud to you, okay?
[27:01.320 --> 27:01.980]  All right.
[27:02.280 --> 27:03.380]  Norm smelled dead.
[27:03.860 --> 27:05.280]  Raw, deep, ruthless.
[27:05.560 --> 27:06.680]  It permeated the farm.
[27:06.980 --> 27:07.700]  Not natural.
[27:08.200 --> 27:10.100]  Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, New Hampshire.
[27:10.420 --> 27:11.080]  Every place.
[27:11.760 --> 27:13.880]  Bittersweet, alchemical, acid, bacon.
[27:14.340 --> 27:15.720]  Notes of a not natural nectar.
[27:16.100 --> 27:16.380]  Murder.
[27:16.920 --> 27:19.760]  The family chain saturated with lime and lecithin.
[27:19.760 --> 27:23.860]  Smoked and roasted a thumb through the eyes indicating a sacred twisted ritual.
[27:24.360 --> 27:24.460]  Help.
[27:24.980 --> 27:25.240]  Love.
[27:25.660 --> 27:25.960]  Die.
[27:26.420 --> 27:28.720]  Notes pressed into the mouth with dark alderwood.
[27:29.060 --> 27:30.620]  Trademarks of the twisted convict.
[27:30.980 --> 27:32.000]  Norm mouthed to Tony.
[27:32.460 --> 27:34.280]  Vos just traveled here with the woman.
[27:34.740 --> 27:35.300]  Your woman.
[27:36.480 --> 27:40.220]  Are we in the magazine aisle or book aisle with this?
[27:41.020 --> 27:41.840]  No, it's all food.
[27:42.060 --> 27:42.280]  Okay.
[27:42.380 --> 27:43.740]  All food?
[27:44.000 --> 27:44.700]  Murder food.
[27:45.360 --> 27:45.980]  Murder food?
[27:46.160 --> 27:46.940]  Well, it's all food.
[27:47.140 --> 27:48.780]  Yeah, it's all stuff that goes in your mouth.
[27:50.420 --> 27:51.340]  Pepperidge Farms?
[27:51.940 --> 27:52.220]  Maybe?
[27:52.600 --> 27:54.360]  Is this a Pepperidge Farm product?
[27:54.960 --> 27:55.940]  No, Pepperidge Farm.
[27:56.360 --> 27:57.200]  Meatless chicken.
[27:58.500 --> 28:03.080]  It's a story about two cops who are chasing a serial killer who has abducted one of their
[28:03.080 --> 28:03.440]  wives.
[28:04.040 --> 28:04.420]  It's rough.
[28:04.820 --> 28:06.000]  They're chasing them across the country.
[28:06.240 --> 28:07.420]  They got there just too late.
[28:07.520 --> 28:09.020]  Yeah, it's gotta be like a vegan thing, right?
[28:09.060 --> 28:10.960]  To prevent murder of meat.
[28:12.340 --> 28:15.060]  Is it Dave's Killer Bread?
[28:15.300 --> 28:15.820]  One of the things?
[28:16.420 --> 28:18.020]  No, there's no bread.
[28:18.400 --> 28:20.360]  Is it some impossible meat?
[28:21.080 --> 28:22.060]  No, no, it's nothing like that.
[28:22.120 --> 28:22.980]  There's no, there's actually no meat.
[28:23.080 --> 28:23.820]  I'll tell you, there's no meat.
[28:24.380 --> 28:25.620]  Well, I would say impossible meat.
[28:25.800 --> 28:31.460]  It is definitely, I mean, I don't think you're going to get specifically two of the things,
[28:31.840 --> 28:33.820]  but one of them you guys know very well.
[28:34.340 --> 28:34.620]  What?
[28:34.720 --> 28:35.600]  Apple murder.
[28:36.960 --> 28:41.240]  No, I mean, it's the, it's the, when I, when we, I'll tell you, I'll tell you my thought process.
[28:41.600 --> 28:44.520]  When we had this idea, we came up and we said, we're going to do a short story.
[28:44.640 --> 28:47.080]  I thought, I want to do the most unexpected short story possible.
[28:47.080 --> 28:49.720]  I want to do a murder mystery or like a horror thing
[28:49.720 --> 28:51.440]  because nobody expects that from the grocery store.
[28:51.520 --> 28:55.600]  What's the one product I know of that has the word murder or kill or death in it?
[28:56.720 --> 28:57.820]  And I started there.
[28:58.360 --> 28:58.520]  Liquid death.
[28:59.160 --> 28:59.720]  Liquid death.
[29:01.200 --> 29:01.840]  Oh, shit.
[29:02.500 --> 29:04.080]  Yeah, liquid death was the first thing I grabbed.
[29:04.200 --> 29:05.580]  Murder your thirst, yada, yada, yada.
[29:06.760 --> 29:07.680]  They had a lot of good stuff.
[29:08.400 --> 29:09.400]  Oh, that's fucking smart.
[29:09.400 --> 29:13.220]  And I, I just don't think you guys would get the other two because there's not a lot there.
[29:13.260 --> 29:14.200]  So I'm just going to post the photo.
[29:14.540 --> 29:14.780]  Okay.
[29:14.780 --> 29:18.260]  It's a Tony's chocolate choco lonely bar.
[29:18.480 --> 29:22.120]  And then a Bo's bacon dark.
[29:22.600 --> 29:23.540]  Oh, those are good.
[29:23.960 --> 29:24.200]  Wow.
[29:24.460 --> 29:24.800]  Wow.
[29:25.540 --> 29:27.260]  I haven't seen two of these.
[29:28.260 --> 29:29.360]  I see the Tony stuff everywhere.
[29:29.400 --> 29:30.620]  I'd never seen that other one before.
[29:31.300 --> 29:31.900]  Tony's is good.
[29:32.720 --> 29:33.520]  Dark bacon.
[29:33.880 --> 29:37.280]  Tony's is like, oh, fair trade ish kind of.
[29:37.800 --> 29:38.040]  Yeah.
[29:38.160 --> 29:41.300]  And on the back, it says stuff like ritualistic and alchemical.
[29:41.580 --> 29:42.500]  And I sorry, I got those words.
[29:42.740 --> 29:43.320]  I see.
[29:44.880 --> 29:46.080]  I think bacon.
[29:46.920 --> 29:49.480]  We've just come up with the best way to do a grocery list.
[29:49.980 --> 29:50.380]  Yeah.
[29:50.800 --> 29:52.460]  No one would be able to crack it.
[29:52.780 --> 29:53.860]  It's great to read.
[29:53.980 --> 29:55.040]  It's a fun little story.
[29:55.760 --> 29:57.220]  I think we've innovated here.
[29:57.880 --> 29:58.500]  I do too.
[29:58.540 --> 30:00.460]  And I think we all wrote some really good content.
[30:00.560 --> 30:01.140]  Great stories.
[30:01.260 --> 30:01.500]  Everybody.
[30:01.820 --> 30:02.000]  Yeah.
[30:02.220 --> 30:03.260]  Way to go, guys.
[30:03.360 --> 30:04.480]  This was fucking great.
[30:04.960 --> 30:08.740]  When you bought your items, Gavin, did you put a word in for your signature?
[30:09.020 --> 30:10.060]  Did you start that?
[30:10.620 --> 30:12.740]  No, I shopped at a place that doesn't have it.
[30:14.380 --> 30:14.780]  Okay.
[30:14.960 --> 30:15.740]  Doesn't have the signature.
[30:16.180 --> 30:17.200]  We're still gonna.
[30:17.860 --> 30:19.320]  That's gonna be a thing that will come.
[30:19.880 --> 30:21.520]  You haven't started your narrative yet.
[30:21.760 --> 30:22.500]  No, not yet.
[30:23.220 --> 30:23.960]  I'm excited.
[30:24.600 --> 30:25.680]  I'm excited for that.
[30:26.100 --> 30:27.200]  I just think it'll be.
[30:27.320 --> 30:28.820]  I want to know how long it takes you.
[30:29.460 --> 30:30.600]  Speaking of buying stuff.
[30:30.780 --> 30:32.560]  I don't know what led me down this hole.
[30:32.580 --> 30:33.220]  I think I was looking.
[30:33.520 --> 30:34.680]  I'm watching Breaking Bad.
[30:34.760 --> 30:37.140]  So I was looking at Breaking Bad stuff online.
[30:37.420 --> 30:40.920]  And I found that on Amazon, you can buy this.
[30:40.920 --> 30:45.060]  It's like a latex Bryan Cranston mask.
[30:45.420 --> 30:46.960]  But it's so cheap.
[30:47.040 --> 30:48.220]  It was like 20 bucks.
[30:48.820 --> 30:53.060]  And I thought there's no way it actually looks that good, right?
[30:53.320 --> 30:55.120]  And then I read one of the reviews.
[30:56.640 --> 30:58.020]  2.2 stars.
[31:02.460 --> 31:02.920]  Terrible.
[31:03.380 --> 31:04.840]  This looks nothing like the picture.
[31:04.980 --> 31:07.100]  This is a dollar store mask, as you see in my picture.
[31:07.680 --> 31:08.740]  You zoom in on that picture.
[31:08.740 --> 31:11.720]  It's absolutely not the top picture.
[31:12.240 --> 31:13.820]  How do they get away with that?
[31:14.000 --> 31:14.720]  How do they get away with that?
[31:15.280 --> 31:16.180]  That's a great question.
[31:16.940 --> 31:20.060]  I think nobody cares who's going to stop them.
[31:29.100 --> 31:31.140]  The thing is, I could kind of see it.
[31:32.440 --> 31:38.040]  I think if you were to ask me who that character is, I think I would say Walt.
[31:38.740 --> 31:39.320]  Would you really?
[31:39.820 --> 31:42.500]  I think so, because it kind of looks like him.
[31:42.640 --> 31:45.320]  I don't think the nose looks anything like him.
[31:45.700 --> 31:49.380]  The goatee to me and the baldness is really what jump out to me about.
[31:49.540 --> 31:52.380]  But maybe I'm saying that with the advantage of context.
[31:53.340 --> 31:56.940]  That image right there looks like 60% of the UFC fighters.
[32:00.020 --> 32:01.660]  Andrew, do you think that would fit on your head?
[32:02.260 --> 32:03.980]  No, absolutely not.
[32:04.740 --> 32:08.660]  I think I would rip that cheap mask in half.
[32:08.740 --> 32:09.380]  Putting it on.
[32:10.320 --> 32:11.840]  I think it would be real disturbed.
[32:12.260 --> 32:13.440]  I think we should try it, though.
[32:14.080 --> 32:16.140]  Yeah, listen, if you send me a link, I'll buy it.
[32:16.380 --> 32:17.280]  I'll throw it on.
[32:19.280 --> 32:21.240]  I'll 3D scan that as well.
[32:21.400 --> 32:22.600]  Get some additional depth.
[32:23.020 --> 32:24.580]  Yeah, I'm so excited to scan your head.
[32:25.000 --> 32:27.500]  Okay, yeah, I guess we need to talk about this.
[32:27.640 --> 32:30.980]  Because we have this situation that seems like it's going to get resolved.
[32:31.120 --> 32:35.920]  Where you're going to get a new phone, so we can do away with the umidigi bison.
[32:35.920 --> 32:39.720]  But you're saying that you aren't going to use the new phone.
[32:39.860 --> 32:41.880]  You're going to use the umidigi.
[32:42.440 --> 32:44.940]  Well, listen, the umidigi is a great phone.
[32:45.020 --> 32:47.620]  The bison, the what am I?
[32:47.740 --> 32:48.260]  X2?
[32:48.640 --> 32:51.940]  The bison X, designed by umidigi.
[32:52.040 --> 32:53.360]  Great logo, great phone.
[32:54.140 --> 32:58.540]  I don't think it has the capability to use whatever app Gavin needs me to use.
[32:58.540 --> 33:01.580]  Because he's going to 3D print my head or attempt to.
[33:01.940 --> 33:03.900]  And I guess I need to scan it somehow.
[33:03.960 --> 33:04.980]  How does that work, Gavin?
[33:05.080 --> 33:05.760]  What app?
[33:05.920 --> 33:06.740]  Am I downloading?
[33:07.280 --> 33:07.700]  Well, I don't know.
[33:07.800 --> 33:10.580]  I'm pretty sure there's apps where you just have someone walk around your head.
[33:10.660 --> 33:11.580]  I don't know.
[33:11.920 --> 33:12.740]  I've never used it.
[33:12.800 --> 33:13.540]  I don't know.
[33:14.120 --> 33:17.920]  You said it so confidently when this was initially brought up.
[33:18.620 --> 33:21.400]  You said it like you use this app all the time.
[33:21.500 --> 33:22.120]  That you do it.
[33:22.700 --> 33:23.820]  You're all good to go.
[33:24.460 --> 33:25.220]  You have no clue.
[33:25.760 --> 33:27.140]  This is a fictional app.
[33:27.300 --> 33:28.920]  No, I was just suggesting how we could do it.
[33:29.140 --> 33:34.260]  You're at the stage where you're sending him a phone to use an app that you've never
[33:35.060 --> 33:35.940]  seen yourself.
[33:37.040 --> 33:40.080]  I'm sending him the phone like months before this idea.
[33:40.440 --> 33:41.400]  I'm just sending him a phone.
[33:42.420 --> 33:43.300]  That's teleportation.
[33:43.820 --> 33:44.900]  Like, it's ridiculous.
[33:45.540 --> 33:47.240]  You're just like, yeah, we'll teleport it.
[33:47.620 --> 33:50.840]  But if you know it's possible, do you know there are apps, then we can do it.
[33:51.860 --> 33:52.260]  There you go.
[33:52.320 --> 33:53.520]  Okay, it's fair.
[33:53.820 --> 33:59.960]  Like, I've never used augmented reality to put an IKEA chair in my living room,
[34:00.040 --> 34:01.000]  but I know you can do it.
[34:03.180 --> 34:04.440]  Can you stack chairs?
[34:05.200 --> 34:08.440]  What if you stack 10 augmented chairs and put a hot dog on top?
[34:09.880 --> 34:10.880]  Will it go faster?
[34:14.120 --> 34:14.480]  What?
[34:14.560 --> 34:15.500]  Why is there a hot dog on top?
[34:16.240 --> 34:19.200]  The tables is making reference to when you guys were doing the table stack.
[34:19.420 --> 34:20.300]  Was that a hot dog thing?
[34:20.940 --> 34:21.460]  Wasn't it?
[34:21.660 --> 34:22.020]  No.
[34:23.240 --> 34:24.380]  Am I making that up?
[34:24.460 --> 34:28.380]  I thought the whole point was there's a hot dog on the top of it and it would launch.
[34:29.220 --> 34:29.940]  That's my...
[34:29.940 --> 34:30.080]  What?
[34:30.720 --> 34:32.460]  What are you talking about?
[34:33.160 --> 34:33.600]  Huh?
[34:34.880 --> 34:39.140]  No, we weren't gonna shoot hot dogs over the ceiling with like a...
[34:39.140 --> 34:44.800]  and try to catch it in our mouths over the roof of Rooster Teeth with a gun or something that Gavin had.
[34:44.820 --> 34:46.360]  Yeah, I don't think we're gonna use a table for that.
[34:46.460 --> 34:47.640]  That was a totally different thing.
[34:48.120 --> 34:50.660]  No, I remember the hot dog thing as an aside.
[34:50.780 --> 34:53.240]  I just remember as part of the table conversation,
[34:53.540 --> 34:57.980]  I could have swore it was at some point discussed of like,
[34:58.160 --> 35:02.240]  if the hot dog was on top of the table, would it launch faster?
[35:03.340 --> 35:05.900]  I don't have confidence to tell you that you're wrong.
[35:06.080 --> 35:08.220]  I think that maybe there might be something to that.
[35:08.380 --> 35:09.060]  I just can't remember.
[35:09.640 --> 35:13.080]  Yeah, well, I also am not confident in saying I'm right.
[35:13.620 --> 35:16.180]  We need the audience to come in and help on that one.
[35:16.880 --> 35:17.280]  Which...
[35:17.960 --> 35:20.040]  Speaking of audience helping, just to pivot for a minute,
[35:20.380 --> 35:25.900]  I did an impromptu stream of the Elden Ring final DLC boss last night.
[35:26.200 --> 35:27.560]  Because I was going to do it anyway.
[35:27.940 --> 35:29.540]  I had these runes.
[35:29.600 --> 35:30.500]  I had like 20 of them.
[35:30.500 --> 35:33.460]  And every time you use one, it boosts your health.
[35:33.660 --> 35:37.100]  And so I thought I'll give like 20 goes to see if I can beat this boss.
[35:37.500 --> 35:40.660]  I learned I've been playing Elden Ring wrong this entire time.
[35:40.760 --> 35:41.300]  Oh, Christ.
[35:41.300 --> 35:45.360]  It was fantastic to have a whole chat of people
[35:46.760 --> 35:52.280]  explain to me what I should be doing and how much easier my life was from that point.
[35:52.540 --> 35:53.760]  But it was the final boss.
[35:54.000 --> 35:55.220]  It was the final boss.
[35:55.300 --> 35:58.140]  I'd beaten every boss outside of one that I wasn't aware of.
[35:58.140 --> 36:00.680]  It did that really quickly upon beating it.
[36:01.200 --> 36:08.160]  But it was stuff like you should drink this flask that you have that gives you bonuses.
[36:08.820 --> 36:10.820]  And I was like, well, I have no idea what that is.
[36:10.900 --> 36:14.180]  I thought I just drank it and then I used it.
[36:14.280 --> 36:17.680]  But I guess you need to sit down and like put your items into it.
[36:18.020 --> 36:21.200]  And so they're explaining to me I had like 40 different modifiers
[36:21.200 --> 36:25.260]  you could apply to this thing that I just have never used the whole game.
[36:26.240 --> 36:30.180]  And I've been using a katana as my sword.
[36:30.300 --> 36:31.620]  I've just been one handing it.
[36:32.020 --> 36:33.700]  And they're like, why are you one handing it?
[36:33.740 --> 36:35.720]  Why don't you use both hands on the thing?
[36:35.980 --> 36:38.820]  And I had to I had to ask, like, what what do you mean by that?
[36:38.840 --> 36:39.600]  How does that work?
[36:39.860 --> 36:44.300]  I guess you do like 20% more damage if you use two hands.
[36:44.600 --> 36:49.160]  And I just have never done that because I didn't know that was like a thing you were supposed to do.
[36:49.480 --> 36:51.820]  And then there's like a quick tab off of that.
[36:52.060 --> 36:54.920]  It was a lot of me just going, what am I doing?
[36:54.920 --> 36:56.120]  How do I do this?
[36:56.620 --> 37:00.580]  And then I beat it within like 30 minutes after doing it.
[37:00.880 --> 37:03.580]  How many hours into this game would you say you are?
[37:03.740 --> 37:07.220]  I think when I pause my it's like 200 hours or something.
[37:07.440 --> 37:09.420]  My elbow, I'm like level 201.
[37:09.800 --> 37:11.320]  I've played a lot of Elden Ring.
[37:11.540 --> 37:15.500]  You can never make fun of me for beating Crackdown not knowing about auto lock again.
[37:16.620 --> 37:19.000]  Yeah, I mean, I've never played Elden Ring.
[37:19.340 --> 37:21.460]  Is where do you learn the stuff you missed?
[37:21.980 --> 37:23.520]  I don't know because I missed it.
[37:23.860 --> 37:27.320]  Because they're not great about explaining shit to you in Elden Ring.
[37:28.040 --> 37:29.060]  You need to ask somebody else.
[37:29.520 --> 37:30.580]  But I missed a lot.
[37:31.080 --> 37:35.460]  And it was such a great experience to have people that actually know how that game works.
[37:35.740 --> 37:38.200]  So you're thankful for the audience for coming in.
[37:38.220 --> 37:38.840]  So thankful.
[37:39.020 --> 37:42.320]  Basically cutting the length of the stream down by like 70%.
[37:43.280 --> 37:44.180]  So much.
[37:44.580 --> 37:46.220]  Yeah, it was great.
[37:46.520 --> 37:47.100]  They were so helpful.
[37:47.400 --> 37:52.680]  So did your character basically go from just like a normal dude to a god in 30 minutes?
[37:52.680 --> 37:54.660]  Just because you respect your equipment.
[37:54.880 --> 37:56.320]  It certainly felt like it.
[37:56.580 --> 37:57.720]  Like I was doing way more damage.
[37:57.840 --> 37:58.740]  I recorded all of it.
[37:58.800 --> 38:02.360]  It'll probably be up at some point as a VOD, I assume.
[38:02.820 --> 38:05.960]  Did it get so much easier after all that?
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.600]  Oh, it was so it was noticeably so much easier.
[38:08.960 --> 38:09.960]  Yeah, that's awesome.
[38:10.040 --> 38:13.880]  And then I guess I learned that if you summon AI to help you in the fight,
[38:13.900 --> 38:15.780]  it makes the boss tougher to kill.
[38:16.240 --> 38:22.220]  And so the run that I ended up beating him on was one where I just forgot to summon the guy.
[38:23.100 --> 38:24.740]  And I think that was the difference.
[38:25.100 --> 38:28.240]  Because I'd go in, I'd summon an AI, and then I'd spawn an AI.
[38:28.440 --> 38:30.040]  I forgot half of the team.
[38:31.220 --> 38:33.120]  And then I got it, which was great.
[38:33.700 --> 38:34.520]  A lot of fun.
[38:34.940 --> 38:36.000]  It was a great stream.
[38:36.560 --> 38:40.520]  Speaking of Elden Ring, Andrew, this is a question I asked Gavin and Eric the other day.
[38:40.620 --> 38:44.780]  But what video game do you think you're the best at out of all the video games you've ever played?
[38:46.900 --> 38:48.340]  Oh, Left 4 Dead 2?
[38:48.920 --> 38:49.160]  Okay.
[38:49.560 --> 38:49.960]  Possibly.
[38:50.540 --> 38:50.720]  Okay.
[38:51.060 --> 38:51.600]  Nick, how about you?
[38:55.660 --> 38:56.940]  God of War Ragnarok.
[38:57.440 --> 38:58.720]  Okay, God of War Ragnarok.
[38:58.860 --> 38:59.080]  Really?
[38:59.540 --> 38:59.700]  Yeah.
[39:00.040 --> 39:01.260]  Wow, that's a recent game.
[39:02.300 --> 39:02.660]  What is?
[39:02.680 --> 39:04.760]  Also, like, tough to measure.
[39:05.480 --> 39:06.320]  It's a single player only.
[39:06.720 --> 39:12.120]  Yeah, it doesn't help as much because it was kind of a multiplayer focused question.
[39:12.240 --> 39:12.640]  But it's okay.
[39:12.660 --> 39:13.360]  I'm gonna roll with it, Nick.
[39:13.380 --> 39:13.740]  We can roll.
[39:13.960 --> 39:15.560]  You can still be good at a single player game.
[39:15.860 --> 39:16.420]  Nick's just like...
[39:18.140 --> 39:19.560]  Maybe he's a speed runner or something.
[39:19.560 --> 39:19.800]  Yeah.
[39:21.280 --> 39:22.800]  He's like the Queen Valkyrie.
[39:22.920 --> 39:24.360]  Just like, I rule, I'm the best.
[39:24.360 --> 39:25.060]  Yeah.
[39:26.560 --> 39:26.920]  Halo 3.
[39:27.100 --> 39:28.360]  I stopped the fight, guys.
[39:28.600 --> 39:29.120]  I did it.
[39:29.880 --> 39:30.040]  Oh.
[39:30.760 --> 39:35.600]  So let's say, through a series of unfortunate and cosmic events,
[39:37.260 --> 39:44.620]  every single person on Earth who plays God of War Ragnarok and Left 4 Dead 2,
[39:44.780 --> 39:46.360]  except for y'all, dies.
[39:46.680 --> 39:47.220]  They're just gone.
[39:47.300 --> 39:47.840]  They're wiped out.
[39:48.400 --> 39:49.260]  The world keeps moving.
[39:49.840 --> 39:51.740]  It's not dangerous to play those games anymore.
[39:51.740 --> 39:53.420]  It just happens to be that they're all dead,
[39:53.540 --> 39:56.320]  and you are now the only two people in the world that are playing those two games.
[39:56.660 --> 40:00.940]  How long do you think you're the best player in the world at that game, going forward?
[40:02.060 --> 40:05.060]  Until, like, four other people decide to play it.
[40:06.240 --> 40:06.520]  Probably.
[40:06.680 --> 40:08.400]  Yeah, my answer was by the end of the week.
[40:09.100 --> 40:11.220]  You could be the best player in the world for a week,
[40:11.380 --> 40:16.440]  and then just through the natural course of people stumbling into the game and finding it,
[40:16.560 --> 40:18.220]  and then not even trying to be better than you,
[40:18.280 --> 40:20.980]  but they just pick up, and then they just naturally progress to a point
[40:20.980 --> 40:21.640]  where they're better than you.
[40:21.980 --> 40:23.040]  It can't take long, right?
[40:23.260 --> 40:23.520]  No.
[40:23.800 --> 40:24.220]  Oh, totally.
[40:24.820 --> 40:25.900]  Yeah, I think I could help.
[40:26.080 --> 40:29.680]  I actually, I said Peggle 2, and I told Eric and Gavin,
[40:29.780 --> 40:32.180]  I think I could be the best Peggle 2 player in the world for two weeks,
[40:32.400 --> 40:34.740]  but I probably, that's probably, that's probably generous.
[40:35.600 --> 40:37.600]  I feel like you could hold Peggle for a while.
[40:37.980 --> 40:40.820]  Like, I think Peggle is a kind of niche game.
[40:40.920 --> 40:43.180]  I'm sure the top end of Peggle is insane,
[40:43.800 --> 40:46.520]  but just on a general scale, I think you'd hold that.
[40:46.520 --> 40:54.800]  Yeah, but I bet there's some, like, 62-year-old, like, math teacher retiree out there
[40:54.800 --> 40:57.320]  who picks up Peggle, who's only ever played Candy Crush,
[40:57.400 --> 40:58.380]  and is like, oh, this is interesting.
[40:58.680 --> 41:02.000]  And then, like, three weeks later is, fuck, is a god in Peggle.
[41:02.040 --> 41:02.480]  You know what I mean?
[41:02.980 --> 41:03.220]  Yeah.
[41:03.240 --> 41:07.440]  I feel like that game applies, like, it finds those people and they become, like, insane.
[41:07.500 --> 41:11.940]  My daughter has this fucking water sort game that she plays on her phone that's so stupid.
[41:13.020 --> 41:15.120]  But it's just like, it's just like a calms her, you know?
[41:15.120 --> 41:16.440]  It's just like her idle thing.
[41:16.620 --> 41:19.860]  And she's, like, level 17,000.
[41:20.060 --> 41:22.540]  And I thought, oh, I'm gonna catch up to her and beat her.
[41:22.860 --> 41:24.080]  And I sat down and tried to do it.
[41:24.120 --> 41:25.480]  And I've got, I got to, like, level...
[41:25.480 --> 41:27.960]  I played every day for, like, I don't know, a month.
[41:28.020 --> 41:30.380]  And I got to, like, level 400.
[41:31.280 --> 41:31.820]  Oh, God.
[41:32.140 --> 41:34.900]  And I think she might be the number one player in the world of that game and has no idea.
[41:35.640 --> 41:38.640]  Because I don't know, like, she must have invested a thousand hours into it easily.
[41:39.140 --> 41:41.920]  I just feel like there's a lot of people out there that find games like Peggle that just
[41:41.920 --> 41:44.860]  fucking... that would never even know there's a Peggle community, you know?
[41:45.300 --> 41:49.220]  Like, a Peggle tournament feels like a backdrop to a Christopher Guest movie.
[41:49.960 --> 41:53.540]  Like, the personalities I imagine that would be, like, a lead at Peggle.
[41:53.760 --> 41:54.360]  Yeah. Yeah.
[41:54.360 --> 41:57.220]  It's the same people that, like, that participate in puzzle competitions,
[41:57.340 --> 41:59.040]  which, by the way, I just got into on TikTok.
[41:59.340 --> 42:01.660]  And I am intrigued by...
[42:01.660 --> 42:02.420]  Like, jigsaw puzzle?
[42:03.020 --> 42:03.260]  Yeah.
[42:03.300 --> 42:05.960]  Like, you get together with teams and do, like, a 500-person puzzle.
[42:06.240 --> 42:07.680]  Like, you and one other person are by yourself.
[42:08.480 --> 42:09.480]  And it's... it's timed.
[42:09.660 --> 42:11.280]  What kind of advanced tactics do they have?
[42:12.880 --> 42:15.580]  Uh, everybody seems to have their own... their own methods.
[42:15.960 --> 42:19.280]  Um, I have... most of the tournaments I've watched, you don't get
[42:19.280 --> 42:22.760]  to see any one person long enough to kind of figure out what their secrets are.
[42:23.840 --> 42:24.920]  But I think I could do it.
[42:25.260 --> 42:25.860]  I think I could do it.
[42:25.900 --> 42:28.360]  I think I could enter a puzzle tournament and... and do well.
[42:28.600 --> 42:32.200]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[42:32.560 --> 42:35.420]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[42:35.580 --> 42:39.100]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[42:39.380 --> 42:40.960]  Available for a limited time.
[42:40.960 --> 42:43.400]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[42:43.760 --> 42:48.480]  Does it ever feel like you're a marketing professional just speaking into the void?
[42:49.540 --> 42:53.120]  Well, with LinkedIn Ads, you can know you're reaching the right decision makers.
[42:53.580 --> 42:58.560]  You can even target buyers by job title, industry, company, seniority, skills...
[42:59.380 --> 43:00.720]  Wait, did I say job title yet?
[43:01.100 --> 43:05.820]  Get started today and see how you can avoid the void and reach the right buyers with LinkedIn Ads.
[43:06.140 --> 43:09.060]  We'll even give you a $100 credit on your next campaign.
[43:09.060 --> 43:11.800]  Get started at LinkedIn.com results.
[43:12.480 --> 43:13.540]  Terms and conditions apply.
[43:14.900 --> 43:16.980]  The problem with that is I don't...
[43:16.980 --> 43:19.740]  How many people are casually entering a puzzle tournament?
[43:20.300 --> 43:21.660]  I feel like it might just be you.
[43:22.740 --> 43:26.820]  Everybody else I think is like they've invested countless hours.
[43:27.240 --> 43:29.820]  Oh no, I'm saying I think I'm at a point in my life right now
[43:29.820 --> 43:31.420]  where I could compete against those people in puzzles.
[43:31.540 --> 43:33.180]  I don't know how we got off on the puzzle thing.
[43:33.560 --> 43:35.020]  I was just talking about the video game deal.
[43:35.200 --> 43:38.600]  But now that you mention it, I think my puzzle skills are of a level
[43:38.600 --> 43:43.520]  that I could I could walk in and compete at a semi-professional level right now.
[43:43.520 --> 43:47.500]  This is your and Andrew's version of the Halo 2 times where
[43:48.980 --> 43:51.380]  Andrew's going to try and have to beat your times on puzzles.
[43:51.860 --> 43:54.000]  I do. Well, I'm thinking about it.
[43:54.200 --> 43:57.160]  Isn't it just kind of luck to a certain extent?
[43:57.300 --> 44:00.980]  Like, how do they... does it start pieces in the box
[44:00.980 --> 44:03.180]  and you have to take out the pieces and then organize it?
[44:03.200 --> 44:06.800]  It starts with the pieces in the bag in the box.
[44:07.020 --> 44:07.640]  You rip it open.
[44:08.200 --> 44:12.460]  Are you saying that puzzles are so... like, puzzle competitions are RNG based?
[44:16.260 --> 44:20.020]  Like, you might open it and then go like,
[44:20.080 --> 44:23.360]  oh, fuck, this is bad. Like, this isn't going to work for me.
[44:23.600 --> 44:24.540]  I just might as well like...
[44:25.160 --> 44:27.180]  Oh, it's no... no outside pieces in this one.
[44:27.300 --> 44:28.140]  Oh, that's a run killer.
[44:30.900 --> 44:35.440]  Now, is it... is it typically, Jeff, like a normal puzzle
[44:35.440 --> 44:37.620]  or is it the puzzles where it's like all one color?
[44:38.060 --> 44:39.420]  No, it's typically... it's a normal puzzle.
[44:39.520 --> 44:42.060]  It's like a 500 piece like Ravensburg puzzle or whatever.
[44:42.380 --> 44:42.980]  Yeah, that I've seen.
[44:43.220 --> 44:45.180]  They... I don't like those puzzles myself.
[44:45.320 --> 44:45.940]  I think they're kind of cheap.
[44:46.280 --> 44:47.380]  I use a different brand.
[44:47.820 --> 44:49.780]  I use a... I'm a pomegranate guy, personally.
[44:50.120 --> 44:52.540]  But yeah, I think they use like Ravensburg, yeah.
[44:53.100 --> 44:54.340]  What's a pomegranate puzzle?
[44:54.880 --> 44:56.540]  Oh, they make the best puzzles, dude.
[44:56.580 --> 44:57.140]  Hold on a second.
[44:57.660 --> 44:58.440]  You gotta show me.
[44:59.180 --> 45:00.980]  I like the What's Jig puzzles.
[45:01.160 --> 45:01.900]  Is that what they're called?
[45:02.340 --> 45:03.520]  What's Jig, I think.
[45:04.160 --> 45:09.740]  Where the front of the box is what the design you're making is looking at.
[45:09.980 --> 45:11.980]  So it doesn't specifically help you.
[45:12.080 --> 45:12.780]  It's like you're creating...
[45:13.320 --> 45:17.000]  Like you're making a puzzle of a tiger, but it's like on the front of the box.
[45:17.080 --> 45:17.800]  It's like a gazelle.
[45:18.540 --> 45:21.000]  Yeah, and you're building the perspective.
[45:21.540 --> 45:23.120]  It's called like a What's a Jig.
[45:23.720 --> 45:25.000]  Yeah, I've done those before.
[45:25.160 --> 45:25.580]  Those are good.
[45:25.960 --> 45:26.640]  Those are cool.
[45:26.900 --> 45:29.580]  Do you remember seeing ads for Puzz 3D?
[45:30.340 --> 45:30.720]  No.
[45:31.200 --> 45:32.300]  What's Puzz 3D?
[45:32.300 --> 45:35.060]  Like three dimensional, like you build the whole thing.
[45:35.240 --> 45:37.720]  But I was always way too poor to have one.
[45:37.840 --> 45:39.940]  But I wonder if they were good or not.
[45:40.320 --> 45:42.660]  Somebody gave me one recently and I haven't done it yet.
[45:42.980 --> 45:43.460]  I have the Eiffel Tower.
[45:43.700 --> 45:44.220]  You have one?
[45:44.500 --> 45:46.320]  Yeah. Somewhere in my garage.
[45:46.720 --> 45:50.520]  I think we could test to see if you're ready to compete with the real people by
[45:50.520 --> 45:55.380]  having like a real time contest on the TV behind you.
[45:55.460 --> 45:58.700]  And you're also trying to compete with your own version of the same puzzle.
[45:59.540 --> 46:01.280]  Yeah, maybe we could stream it somehow or something.
[46:03.160 --> 46:04.120]  Maybe that's not exciting.
[46:04.340 --> 46:12.840]  I would love to see a live stream of you trying to show off how fast you can solve a puzzle.
[46:13.340 --> 46:14.700]  That could go so wrong.
[46:14.980 --> 46:16.760]  The idea of the most energetic intro.
[46:16.940 --> 46:18.620]  That's like, all right, let's get to it.
[46:19.000 --> 46:20.060]  Well, I mean, you guys would be there.
[46:20.100 --> 46:21.340]  You guys would be there commentating.
[46:21.460 --> 46:22.060]  We'd all be talking.
[46:22.680 --> 46:24.100]  Oh, that wouldn't be too distracting?
[46:24.580 --> 46:25.500]  No, not for me.
[46:26.660 --> 46:27.760]  Yeah, he's good at these.
[46:28.040 --> 46:30.020]  Yeah, man, I can multitask.
[46:30.020 --> 46:32.720]  Okay, so this is a Wuzjig?
[46:33.020 --> 46:33.860]  It's Wuz?
[46:34.820 --> 46:35.260]  Wuzjig?
[46:35.440 --> 46:35.760]  Wuzjig.
[46:35.880 --> 46:37.020]  Yeah, those guys.
[46:37.220 --> 46:38.720]  I've done about four of those.
[46:38.820 --> 46:39.800]  They're great, dude.
[46:39.940 --> 46:40.800]  But I don't understand.
[46:40.960 --> 46:42.400]  Like, what am I looking at that's different?
[46:42.520 --> 46:43.020]  It's on the...
[46:43.020 --> 46:43.320]  Okay, here.
[46:44.600 --> 46:45.800]  Let me give you an example.
[46:45.940 --> 46:47.940]  So I see the box I just posted.
[46:48.580 --> 46:48.920]  Uh-huh.
[46:49.280 --> 46:50.920]  The farmer on the bridge.
[46:51.080 --> 46:53.480]  That's what the image makes that you make out of the puzzle.
[46:53.680 --> 46:54.800]  It's what he's seeing.
[46:55.300 --> 46:58.600]  So you're seeing the perspective of whatever the farmer is seeing.
[46:58.600 --> 47:02.720]  And then when you build the puzzle, you're seeing what the farmer is seeing.
[47:02.980 --> 47:04.920]  So you're seeing what everyone is scared of.
[47:05.220 --> 47:05.740]  Yes.
[47:06.220 --> 47:08.560]  Whatever they're reacting to is what you're actually building.
[47:09.280 --> 47:13.840]  So, like, the front of the box doesn't give you any hints, essentially, to what it is.
[47:14.260 --> 47:14.960]  It's just provided.
[47:14.960 --> 47:16.000]  So unlike the other one that was posted.
[47:16.940 --> 47:18.000]  I guess, yeah.
[47:18.280 --> 47:19.780]  That one looks sort of identical.
[47:20.620 --> 47:22.460]  Uh, it's not, actually.
[47:22.740 --> 47:22.760]  It's a little different.
[47:22.840 --> 47:24.440]  The one at the top isn't identical.
[47:24.700 --> 47:27.040]  It's like a before and after.
[47:27.040 --> 47:30.820]  So what you see in the picture is before in that room.
[47:30.860 --> 47:34.140]  And then the puzzle you put together is the after the thing happens.
[47:34.480 --> 47:35.340]  So it's in the same room.
[47:35.400 --> 47:36.120]  It's the same perspective.
[47:36.220 --> 47:37.680]  It's just all the people move around.
[47:37.800 --> 47:38.820]  So let me look at Pomegranate.
[47:38.820 --> 47:39.760]  Dude, look at that top one.
[47:39.900 --> 47:41.460]  It has destiny in it.
[47:41.660 --> 47:43.600]  That could have been one of the things Andrew bought.
[47:43.680 --> 47:44.880]  And it's a falcon.
[47:49.700 --> 47:51.000]  Oh, these are just, like, fancy.
[47:51.340 --> 47:53.540]  These are, yeah, like, artistic puzzles.
[47:54.120 --> 47:56.060]  So are these just, like, more difficult?
[47:56.060 --> 47:57.120]  Like, they're cool puzzles?
[47:57.320 --> 47:57.920]  Or, like, what's the deal?
[47:57.920 --> 47:59.200]  Well, they're difficult because...
[47:59.200 --> 48:01.520]  These ones are difficult because you don't have a reference, right?
[48:01.580 --> 48:02.340]  Like, you can't...
[48:02.340 --> 48:03.440]  You don't know what you're putting together.
[48:03.660 --> 48:06.840]  Like, you can see the edges from the picture on the front of the puzzle.
[48:07.280 --> 48:09.160]  You get a sense of the before.
[48:09.380 --> 48:10.820]  So you know, like, the building is on the right.
[48:10.880 --> 48:11.380]  And the car...
[48:11.380 --> 48:12.300]  There's probably a car somewhere.
[48:12.740 --> 48:14.680]  But then when you put the puzzle together, it's the after.
[48:14.860 --> 48:15.860]  And so it's...
[48:15.860 --> 48:18.740]  You can use the cover picture as a reference.
[48:18.840 --> 48:20.400]  But you don't actually know what you're putting together.
[48:21.200 --> 48:22.280]  Does that make any sense at all?
[48:22.720 --> 48:23.600]  Yeah, yeah.
[48:23.600 --> 48:23.820]  Okay.
[48:23.940 --> 48:24.460]  I get what you're saying.
[48:25.620 --> 48:28.040]  I didn't realize we were coming into a puzzle era.
[48:28.120 --> 48:28.840]  I didn't either.
[48:29.100 --> 48:29.940]  I like it.
[48:30.200 --> 48:30.900]  But I'm fucking...
[48:30.900 --> 48:31.860]  My dick is hard for it.
[48:31.960 --> 48:32.500]  Don't get me started.
[48:32.660 --> 48:34.460]  I was like, do you know this is my thing?
[48:34.540 --> 48:36.000]  I had a puzzle nook at the old house.
[48:36.300 --> 48:38.100]  Is it like a 500-piece standard?
[48:38.200 --> 48:40.500]  Like, what is the average puzzle tournament size?
[48:41.020 --> 48:42.100]  Well, so here's the problem.
[48:42.200 --> 48:43.840]  I'm a thousand-piece man myself.
[48:43.980 --> 48:44.720]  Thousand-piece and above.
[48:44.900 --> 48:46.720]  I don't see the point in a 500-piece puzzle.
[48:46.920 --> 48:47.540]  That's like fucking...
[48:47.540 --> 48:48.340]  That's baby stuff.
[48:48.540 --> 48:49.000]  Like half a puzzle.
[48:49.080 --> 48:49.800]  All the...
[48:49.800 --> 48:50.560]  Yeah, it's like a half a puzzle.
[48:51.420 --> 48:54.960]  It's so much fucking simpler than a thousand-piece.
[48:55.140 --> 48:57.840]  Like, it's not just a function of it being half the size.
[48:57.960 --> 48:58.400]  It's just like...
[48:58.400 --> 48:59.800]  It becomes like twice as easy as well.
[49:00.060 --> 49:00.840]  Or three times as easy.
[49:01.220 --> 49:05.240]  But they do the 500s, I think, because you can do it in, you know, an hour or two.
[49:06.080 --> 49:11.200]  Should we do a 500 and then maybe reveal to each other on show how fast it took us to do?
[49:11.640 --> 49:13.340]  We do a puzzle reveal-off?
[49:14.140 --> 49:15.900]  Maybe like we submit...
[49:15.900 --> 49:19.820]  We give Eric our times and he can read off and see who...
[49:21.460 --> 49:22.540]  I love that.
[49:22.620 --> 49:23.900]  I think that's really cool.
[49:23.960 --> 49:26.140]  Do you think that it should all be like the same puzzle?
[49:26.380 --> 49:29.540]  Yes, it has to be the same puzzle, yeah.
[49:30.600 --> 49:33.420]  And then we'll each time it and then we'll send it to Eric.
[49:33.440 --> 49:36.580]  I'm making a note of it and I'll see if we can put it together this week,
[49:36.640 --> 49:38.040]  get everything shipped over the next week,
[49:38.360 --> 49:40.520]  and then you guys have time and can do it for...
[49:40.520 --> 49:41.580]  I haven't done a puzzle in a while.
[49:42.080 --> 49:47.120]  I'm happy to pick, or if it's not fair to pick, at least vet the puzzle option.
[49:47.320 --> 49:48.420]  I think it's fine if you pick.
[49:48.420 --> 49:49.660]  I have no problem with you picking,
[49:49.800 --> 49:51.880]  because it's not like you're selecting it and like,
[49:52.600 --> 49:54.520]  you know, we can show the guys and be like, this is the one.
[49:54.680 --> 49:57.720]  Yeah, we're going pomegranate right now, let me tell you.
[49:57.760 --> 49:59.480]  You guys are never going to want to put together another puzzle again
[49:59.480 --> 50:00.980]  as long as you live when you put that in your face.
[50:01.020 --> 50:03.160]  Yeah, I definitely agree with never wanting to put together
[50:03.160 --> 50:04.400]  another puzzle as long as I live.
[50:04.660 --> 50:05.780]  That's... I agree with you on that.
[50:06.060 --> 50:08.160]  Is it the same bucket as board games for you?
[50:08.160 --> 50:09.740]  It has to be. There's no...
[50:09.740 --> 50:11.260]  That's why I said we submitted to Eric.
[50:11.360 --> 50:13.180]  I immediately gave a rule that wasn't.
[50:13.420 --> 50:15.440]  Hey, I love you. Thank you, Andrew.
[50:15.580 --> 50:17.080]  I don't want to put together a puzzle.
[50:17.080 --> 50:19.180]  Certainly no, no, no.
[50:19.180 --> 50:23.500]  I would like to expand this to, you know, those like safe room type
[50:23.500 --> 50:25.420]  puzzles that you can get, like the handheld,
[50:25.700 --> 50:29.240]  like you have to get the hoop through the knot type thing.
[50:30.160 --> 50:31.420]  You know what I'm talking about?
[50:31.840 --> 50:33.640]  What are these called?
[50:34.460 --> 50:38.760]  It's it's like a puzzle in an escape room.
[50:39.060 --> 50:41.720]  The fuck? No, you're doing like a word puzzle right now.
[50:41.780 --> 50:42.620]  What are you talking about?
[50:42.740 --> 50:45.200]  Yeah, I'm doing the strand, the New York Times strand right now.
[50:45.200 --> 50:52.620]  Um, it's like a puzzle where you have to figure out how to open like a box
[50:52.620 --> 50:58.180]  or like there is a hoop, like a wooden hoop, and you have to get it through the ropes.
[50:58.640 --> 51:00.240]  Oh, Jeff found the puzzle already.
[51:00.380 --> 51:02.820]  Two bears, two bears, a golden hour. Isn't that beautiful?
[51:03.460 --> 51:05.700]  That is nice. I like standing up like humans.
[51:06.480 --> 51:08.400]  That's a brother bear type stuff.
[51:08.480 --> 51:10.560]  I'll listen to Phil Collins. I'll get into it.
[51:10.620 --> 51:12.180]  I'm going to speed run this thing.
[51:12.180 --> 51:16.180]  So that's dude, this is good, too, because if we do this one,
[51:16.280 --> 51:19.960]  the golden hour with the bears on it or whatever, and we get them first,
[51:19.960 --> 51:24.660]  then people at home can also get this same puzzle and there will be a run on this insane
[51:25.300 --> 51:28.480]  fucking bear puzzle like like a Don Zimmer card.
[51:28.580 --> 51:30.040]  This is everything you get.
[51:30.360 --> 51:32.300]  It's going to be a Cosmic Crisp thing all over again.
[51:32.340 --> 51:34.160]  Suddenly we're going to be friends with the pomegranate people.
[51:34.320 --> 51:34.940]  I love it.
[51:37.500 --> 51:39.720]  Uh, trying to figure out what these things are called.
[51:39.940 --> 51:40.900]  I'm surprised none of you.
[51:40.900 --> 51:44.960]  Have you seen, um, the glass onion?
[51:46.360 --> 51:47.900]  Yes. No. Uh-huh.
[51:48.300 --> 51:53.740]  You know, that box thing that he sends everybody to invite them to the island or one of those.
[51:54.020 --> 51:56.360]  They make smaller versions of those.
[51:57.100 --> 52:00.200]  I think it'd be fun for us all to try to take one of those on
[52:00.200 --> 52:02.140]  and just see how long it takes in.
[52:02.380 --> 52:03.960]  I feel like we'd all be really bad at it.
[52:04.240 --> 52:05.340]  Was it like a box?
[52:06.060 --> 52:07.620]  Yeah, it's like a you.
[52:07.720 --> 52:08.560]  There's a hoop in there.
[52:09.120 --> 52:10.180]  There can't be hoops.
[52:10.900 --> 52:15.440]  And you have to sometimes get the knot out of the hoop of the string.
[52:15.480 --> 52:17.660]  I like the explaining all of this and going sometimes.
[52:18.360 --> 52:19.000]  The knot.
[52:20.340 --> 52:22.180]  There's a hoop. Sometimes there's a knot.
[52:22.620 --> 52:23.060]  Okay.
[52:23.220 --> 52:25.020]  I'm going to Google puzzle knot.
[52:25.580 --> 52:26.960]  Get the hoop through.
[52:29.680 --> 52:31.160]  See what pops up.
[52:31.820 --> 52:34.120]  Oh, I feel like it. I feel like Google knows.
[52:34.680 --> 52:36.260]  I feel like Google is getting.
[52:36.460 --> 52:37.920]  Oh yeah, here we go.
[52:38.020 --> 52:38.680]  God, I feel like.
[52:39.440 --> 52:43.280]  Mmm, I want to put this fucking puzzle together so bad.
[52:44.320 --> 52:46.920]  I'm just fucking staring at it right now.
[52:47.000 --> 52:47.360]  I'm just getting.
[52:48.200 --> 52:50.140]  Are you just looking at the bear one still?
[52:50.540 --> 52:52.720]  Yeah, the two fucking bears at magic hour.
[52:53.740 --> 52:55.440]  Okay, I mean, we can get that.
[52:55.560 --> 52:57.420]  We'll order it after we record these episodes.
[52:57.540 --> 52:58.700]  Like, I'm totally fine with that.
[52:59.020 --> 53:01.240]  See, you get it's like you have a ring.
[53:01.580 --> 53:03.460]  One of those freaking things from a Christmas cracker.
[53:03.980 --> 53:04.380]  Sure.
[53:04.780 --> 53:07.100]  Oh, I mean, that's a nice Christmas cracker prize.
[53:07.180 --> 53:07.860]  If that's what you're pulling.
[53:08.680 --> 53:11.060]  Well, imagine that, but like cheap chromed plastic.
[53:12.680 --> 53:16.480]  I feel like Christmas cracker prizes are mini decks of cards.
[53:16.900 --> 53:17.400]  Yeah.
[53:18.220 --> 53:20.020]  Little, little picture frame.
[53:20.260 --> 53:21.640]  Yeah, well, a small stapler.
[53:22.200 --> 53:23.480]  Where are you getting these from?
[53:24.060 --> 53:26.260]  That, yeah, that's in the rotation for sure.
[53:27.300 --> 53:29.060]  I'm going to look into the puzzle puzzle thing.
[53:29.760 --> 53:32.120]  Do you think we should do a star photo for our new company?
[53:32.600 --> 53:32.880]  Yes.
[53:33.620 --> 53:35.600]  Yes, but I think I should be.
[53:35.600 --> 53:39.740]  You should 3D print my head as my display of the company photo.
[53:41.400 --> 53:42.260]  All right, I'm back in.
[53:42.380 --> 53:45.560]  I think I think we should all take it like it's a what jig puzzle.
[53:45.820 --> 53:47.440]  And we're looking at Andrew.
[53:48.060 --> 53:49.960]  It's us looking at Andrew holding a camera.
[53:50.160 --> 53:52.460]  And we're all surprised by what's Gavin seeing.
[53:52.560 --> 53:53.460]  And then you have to put it together.
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.060]  I was thinking it should be in the style of this photo.
[53:58.680 --> 53:59.400]  Pete Rose.
[53:59.860 --> 54:00.240]  Pretty cool.
[54:00.380 --> 54:02.100]  And Tony Perez taking a shit.
[54:02.720 --> 54:03.920]  Are they just shitting at work?
[54:03.980 --> 54:04.540]  Is that what that is?
[54:04.540 --> 54:05.680]  Are they at work there?
[54:06.840 --> 54:07.900]  In the changing rooms?
[54:08.760 --> 54:09.560]  You're yes.
[54:09.680 --> 54:11.320]  Like you're like at work like that.
[54:11.500 --> 54:12.980]  Probably at the baseball stadium.
[54:13.080 --> 54:13.740]  Yeah, I think so.
[54:14.400 --> 54:15.320]  I think we could fight.
[54:15.420 --> 54:16.740]  We could just get five stalls.
[54:17.380 --> 54:17.780]  Yeah.
[54:19.220 --> 54:20.320]  I don't want to.
[54:20.480 --> 54:21.880]  I don't want that to be a what's jig.
[54:22.460 --> 54:22.880]  That image.
[54:23.880 --> 54:26.580]  Yeah, I don't need to see that.
[54:28.520 --> 54:29.340]  Why are they so happy?
[54:29.800 --> 54:33.540]  It would be funny if we had four stalls and then the porta potty.
[54:33.540 --> 54:36.420]  Oh, that's amazing.
[54:36.920 --> 54:40.920]  And we have to strategically cover up all of our testicles and penis and stuff.
[54:41.040 --> 54:41.600]  Our bits.
[54:41.680 --> 54:42.900]  Yeah, cool.
[54:43.020 --> 54:43.960]  Thanks for saying that, man.
[54:44.000 --> 54:44.720]  Really appreciate it.
[54:44.740 --> 54:45.080]  It's great.
[54:45.280 --> 54:47.200]  So you don't want us to show all our junk.
[54:47.560 --> 54:48.560]  OK, got it.
[54:49.200 --> 54:50.740]  It would be cool to make a puzzle.
[54:51.500 --> 54:55.540]  If we made like a piece of content and if you completed the puzzle,
[54:55.640 --> 54:58.900]  it had like a code that you could scan on it that took you to
[54:59.340 --> 55:01.140]  some piece of content somewhere online.
[55:01.660 --> 55:04.280]  It's like that two million dollar puzzle thing I did.
[55:04.780 --> 55:05.300]  What was that?
[55:05.780 --> 55:09.780]  You put the puzzle together and it creates a QR code that you scan,
[55:09.980 --> 55:10.840]  which then tells you.
[55:10.940 --> 55:11.440]  Oh, I see.
[55:11.540 --> 55:12.220]  Two million dollars.
[55:12.440 --> 55:13.680]  I won one dollar.
[55:15.200 --> 55:16.780]  That's like a mischief thing, right?
[55:17.300 --> 55:18.180]  Yeah, that's what it was.
[55:18.860 --> 55:21.540]  I'm so glad that I think I don't know if it's still going on,
[55:21.560 --> 55:24.920]  but they were doing a thing where like you could buy a key
[55:24.920 --> 55:28.000]  and then they sold a box for the key
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.280]  and then people bought both and opened it and it was a key for another box.
[55:32.820 --> 55:35.700]  And last I heard, they were like on box four.
[55:35.940 --> 55:38.800]  And I'm so glad I missed that because that is the thing.
[55:38.980 --> 55:43.240]  I would have been in that loop 100% and I'd be so annoyed by box four.
[55:43.840 --> 55:46.900]  Just endlessly buying boxes that you don't know the purpose of.
[55:47.300 --> 55:49.040]  Hell, are they expensive boxes?
[55:49.700 --> 55:52.280]  I think they're like 25 or 30 bucks a box.
[55:52.340 --> 55:53.560]  Like it's not insignificant.
[55:53.920 --> 55:56.340]  Is the promise that there'll be a payoff at some point?
[55:56.340 --> 56:01.040]  I think there might be something where like if you lift up the foam
[56:01.700 --> 56:05.500]  on the on the inside of the box, there might be something to it.
[56:06.140 --> 56:06.940]  I think.
[56:07.800 --> 56:10.000]  But I'm not sure what it is not clear to me.
[56:10.040 --> 56:14.200]  And this maybe has already been resolved, but I don't know what the end game is.
[56:15.300 --> 56:19.280]  It's something that I like randomly get on my tick tock every like four days.
[56:19.580 --> 56:21.100]  I can't say it's typically the same box.
[56:22.140 --> 56:26.080]  Have have you guys noticed an increase in Dobermans lately?
[56:29.180 --> 56:29.560]  No.
[56:30.020 --> 56:30.580]  Is that just me?
[56:31.060 --> 56:32.000]  Yeah, it's just you.
[56:32.180 --> 56:32.960]  I don't like dogs.
[56:33.280 --> 56:34.260]  I haven't seen one in ages.
[56:34.660 --> 56:37.060]  I'm not. Well, first off, I have no issue with Dobermans.
[56:37.120 --> 56:38.720]  I actually think they're they're lovely dogs.
[56:39.780 --> 56:41.440]  I don't have an issue with them like Andrew, apparently.
[56:41.760 --> 56:42.960]  But it was the weirdest thing.
[56:43.060 --> 56:47.060]  Like when I was a kid growing up, Dobermans were the original pit bulls.
[56:47.360 --> 56:50.340]  Like they were like everybody had a Doberman like in the 70s.
[56:50.340 --> 56:52.360]  And then they were considered like aggressive and dangerous.
[56:52.360 --> 56:53.980]  And then they were banned everywhere.
[56:53.980 --> 56:56.500]  And then suddenly nobody had Dobermans anymore.
[56:56.500 --> 56:57.880]  And they weren't in movies anymore.
[56:58.020 --> 57:01.160]  And then pit bulls became like the thing that everybody was scared of.
[57:01.220 --> 57:03.220]  And now that like that's the quote unquote bad dog.
[57:03.520 --> 57:08.580]  And I guess maybe the moratorium is is breaking because when I went for my bike ride yesterday,
[57:08.640 --> 57:11.880]  I saw three different Dobermans on the hike and bike trail.
[57:11.920 --> 57:12.320]  Wow.
[57:12.380 --> 57:12.940]  I don't think I've seen it.
[57:13.060 --> 57:16.760]  I don't think I've seen a Doberman in in the wild in like 10 years, probably.
[57:17.060 --> 57:20.260]  And to see three in the same day, I realized, oh, something's happening.
[57:20.340 --> 57:20.980]  Something's afoot.
[57:21.440 --> 57:23.200]  That was Magnum PI's dog, right?
[57:23.200 --> 57:24.280]  He had a Doberman.
[57:24.840 --> 57:27.680]  Yeah, Zeus and Apollo, I think, were they were Higgins dogs.
[57:28.240 --> 57:29.940]  Didn't make the fictional dog draft there.
[57:31.200 --> 57:33.940]  No, Higgins dogs would have been great picks.
[57:34.300 --> 57:35.440]  That would have been great picks.
[57:35.820 --> 57:38.640]  Oh, I had an idea for another animal related draft.
[57:38.740 --> 57:39.460]  I wanted to throw you guys away.
[57:39.720 --> 57:41.460]  What about the talking animal draft?
[57:42.360 --> 57:45.120]  Oh, so like can puppets be in?
[57:45.700 --> 57:47.160]  Yeah, a Bugs Bunny could be in.
[57:48.960 --> 57:51.640]  Dr. Doolittle animals could be in like any animal that talks.
[57:52.340 --> 57:53.840]  Dogs on commercials that talk.
[57:54.220 --> 57:55.700]  I'm going to look who's talking.
[57:56.020 --> 57:59.100]  Three is what I'm going with exclusively my whole board.
[58:00.380 --> 58:03.100]  You could absolutely do it as a whole as a whole lot of talking animals there.
[58:03.760 --> 58:06.100]  I am trying to think a great talking animal.
[58:06.560 --> 58:09.900]  There's that talking dog movie from, I want to say, last summer
[58:10.540 --> 58:13.860]  that you look at a trailer for and just go, nobody's going to see this.
[58:14.100 --> 58:15.160]  And then nobody saw it.
[58:15.780 --> 58:17.920]  Was it like strays or something like that?
[58:17.920 --> 58:18.880]  Yeah, that's what it was called.
[58:19.060 --> 58:20.960]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[58:21.640 --> 58:23.080]  I've seen quite a few of...
[58:25.960 --> 58:27.680]  Beverly Hills Chihuahua.
[58:27.900 --> 58:29.600]  There's like four of those, I think.
[58:30.800 --> 58:32.200]  The Taco Bell dog talks.
[58:32.520 --> 58:33.620]  He was in the other draft too, though.
[58:34.520 --> 58:34.780]  Yeah.
[58:35.940 --> 58:37.220]  Will Arnett is in one.
[58:37.560 --> 58:41.160]  Maybe not cartoon talking, but like real animals that talk.
[58:41.740 --> 58:43.500]  Will Arnett talking dog movie.
[58:43.660 --> 58:44.060]  What do you mean?
[58:45.020 --> 58:49.900]  You know, like, you know how like when you talk to the cat and the cat talks back to you
[58:49.900 --> 58:51.080]  and you guys have a conversation, Gavin?
[58:51.080 --> 58:51.320]  No.
[58:51.500 --> 58:58.340]  No, but when the real Taco Bell dog, they would make that dog talk as opposed to a cartoon.
[59:00.000 --> 59:01.040]  Bugs Bunny wouldn't count.
[59:01.160 --> 59:04.580]  I said Bugs Bunny earlier and I'm disqualifying Bugs Bunny from it because it's a cartoon.
[59:04.780 --> 59:09.420]  No animated talking animals, only real animals animated to talk.
[59:10.560 --> 59:13.960]  Like animatronic talking animals, I think could work, but not animated.
[59:14.220 --> 59:16.440]  Photo realistic CG, does that count as animated?
[59:17.780 --> 59:18.480]  Example, please.
[59:18.480 --> 59:18.940]  Yeah.
[59:19.740 --> 59:22.540]  Uh, like the new Lion King.
[59:23.160 --> 59:24.460]  That's a good question.
[59:24.860 --> 59:28.440]  That's, uh, I think that would count because it's photorealistic.
[59:28.800 --> 59:32.680]  Oh, it needs to be photorealistic.
[59:32.860 --> 59:34.060]  That's the cutoff.
[59:34.140 --> 59:37.160]  I just, it doesn't feel like a 2D cartoon to me.
[59:37.200 --> 59:38.280]  That feels more like real life.
[59:38.460 --> 59:41.480]  It's good and it's acting, it's acting next to real people.
[59:42.160 --> 59:44.860]  What about Bugs Bunny in Who Framed Roger Rabbit?
[59:45.060 --> 59:46.120]  Now, now we're talking.
[59:46.120 --> 59:48.620]  Now we're getting to the brass tacks here.
[59:48.760 --> 59:52.600]  If you're going to start making declarations about what can and can't be on the draft board,
[59:52.780 --> 59:54.100]  we got to really get down to it.
[59:54.620 --> 59:55.920]  Yeah, I don't, that's a good question.
[59:56.100 --> 59:56.560]  I don't know.
[59:57.220 --> 59:57.660]  I don't know.
[59:58.020 --> 01:00:03.500]  What about a 3D Bugs, like Bugs Bunny from the movie with Jenna Elfman?
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:06.120]  Where he is in the real world.
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.600]  Back in action, Looney Tunes back in action?
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.400]  Yeah, yeah, Looney Tunes back in action.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:11.980]  What about that?
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:12.940]  I don't know.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:13.580]  I haven't seen it.
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:14.640]  What about this?
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.360]  Look, I just sent it to you.
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.180]  What about that?
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:22.220]  Yeah, I guess so.
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:23.160]  Why not?
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:29.040]  But if he was talking to like Elmer Fudd and the whole thing was animated, you'd say no?
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.200]  Yeah, I guess so.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:31.740]  Why not?
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:34.140]  Okay, okay, then let me propose this to you.
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:39.440]  What if he's speaking to Elmer Fudd, but it's in the real world?
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.100]  Once again, I think I'm back in.
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:42.980]  Yeah, I think that's funny.
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.800]  Because he's also interacting with real world people in the real world.
[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:52.400]  Oh man, I'm just looking at Show Dogs, a movie I haven't thought about in a long time.
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:53.660]  I fucked up.
[01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:55.420]  I should have taken some of these dogs.
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:58.260]  There's a lot of animals who talk.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.380]  There's a lot of talking animals.
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:03.060]  Defining like the best ones is tough.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:04.840]  What about Rocky and Bow Winkle?
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:05.920]  Do these count?
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:12.420]  Because it's them with Robert De Niro in this movie.
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:13.540]  Does that count?
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:14.960]  Yeah, I'll count that.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.200]  Wow, okay.
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:18.940]  Trying to find the line, Gavin.
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:19.880]  I'm trying to find it.
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:22.440]  I mean, you're showing me the same thing over and over again with different characters.
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:23.640]  The line, there's no line.
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:25.460]  The three images are identical.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.120]  I don't agree.
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:31.200]  Humans in the real world standing next to animated characters.
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:36.820]  But what about Rocky and Bow Winkle, a fully animated movie that's 3D CG?
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:37.780]  No.
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:39.460]  Makes no sense.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.560]  No, that's not photorealistic.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:42.520]  I don't see humans in there.
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:43.040]  Not real.
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:44.400]  I don't buy it.
[01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:47.700]  It's not blurring the lines between reality and fiction.
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:48.660]  I can't do it.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.400]  It's also the same fucking characters.
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.060]  You're showing me the same.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.840]  If it were, it's like, just use Bow Winkle from the other one.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:56.900]  It doesn't really matter.
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:57.840]  Right.
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:01:59.260]  I'm trying to find the line.
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:02.220]  There's a Rocky and Bow Winkle that works and a Rocky and Bow Winkle that doesn't.
[01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:05.540]  So I'm trying to find the one that is a maybe from you.
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:06.500]  And that, that...
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:07.880]  Well, you got a yes and a no.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.060]  So pick the yes and then move on.
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:10.560]  We're good.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:10.860]  Got it.
[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:13.100]  I feel like, I feel like we found the line.
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:18.580]  Eric's always pretty aggressive towards finding the line.
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:19.000]  Yeah.
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:22.980]  What about the episode of The Simpsons where Homer goes into the real world?
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:27.280]  Is that the old, like, like, what if the dog was there?
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:32.180]  Well, we're, why, we're not dealing with what ifs.
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:32.940]  That didn't happen.
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:38.320]  If, if it was the dog, if he took Santa's little helper with him and he was, then yeah,
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:38.940]  that'd be fine.
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:40.160]  But that's not what happened.
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:40.880]  Okay.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:42.600]  I want to go jump in a river.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.380]  Nick, any thoughts?
[01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:44.380]  Nope.
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.760]  Why we're overcomplicating this.
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:49.340]  I need to solve a puzzle.
[01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:55.910]  I, I hate, I hate bringing up draft ideas anymore.
[01:02:57.350 --> 01:02:59.230]  It's a good draft.
[01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:04.770]  Well, I feel like drafts at the moment are just causing arguments between you and Eric.
[01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:05.450]  Yeah.
[01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:07.890]  I don't know why.
[01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.610]  Because of Eric.
[01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:13.630]  I can't wait for, uh, for the drink draft to come out.
[01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:15.710]  That's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:17.510]  Whenever that comes out.
[01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:21.290]  Speaking of arguments between people.
[01:03:21.850 --> 01:03:22.530]  That's not my heat.
[01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:25.650]  No, your heat is breakfast foods.
[01:03:25.810 --> 01:03:26.710]  My heat is breakfast foods.
[01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:26.970]  Yeah.
[01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:29.270]  Yeah, Nick, you edited that, right?
[01:03:29.590 --> 01:03:30.590]  I did.
[01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:32.930]  Did you have to do something a little bit extra on that one?
[01:03:33.030 --> 01:03:34.130]  I did.
[01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:35.430]  Okay, that's probably a good idea.
[01:03:36.010 --> 01:03:37.290]  Yeah, it was trimmed a little bit.
[01:03:37.570 --> 01:03:37.910]  Breakfast foods.
[01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:40.590]  There might be a couple of moments specifically I'd like you to trim.
[01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:41.350]  Yeah.
[01:03:42.010 --> 01:03:48.390]  The breakfast foods draft that we did was a learning experience from the condiments draft.
[01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:53.150]  I went from, I went from, from mall draft to condiment in one second.
[01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.770]  I don't know how.
[01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:59.810]  It was a thing where I, as soon as like things got heated in the breakfast foods draft,
[01:03:59.890 --> 01:04:03.110]  I reflected on the condiments draft and I did the opposite.
[01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:05.170]  And I felt like it was a lot better.
[01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:08.550]  I was like, this is, I'm going the opposite direction of this.
[01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:13.190]  We're not at condiments level yet, but it could have led there.
[01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:17.410]  It was when they're looking at the gauges in Chernobyl and be like,
[01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:18.990]  oh, it's not, this doesn't look great.
[01:04:19.610 --> 01:04:22.470]  But thankfully we didn't explode.
[01:04:23.050 --> 01:04:29.110]  My anger and annoyance caught me off guard and it took me maybe five minutes to get under,
[01:04:29.290 --> 01:04:30.030]  get it under control.
[01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:31.250]  And then when I was fine, then we were fine.
[01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:35.170]  I was actively working against any condiment type scenario.
[01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:36.970]  We all were, I think.
[01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:40.630]  You know, in movies when they tap on a gauge sometimes and it like
[01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:43.030]  makes the gauge move, like it was stuck there.
[01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:43.350]  Yeah.
[01:04:43.790 --> 01:04:44.830]  Does that ever happen in real life?
[01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.370]  Yeah.
[01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:46.450]  When?
[01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:49.430]  I'm sure it happens all the time.
[01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:52.530]  They do it in the movie because it's based off of something, right?
[01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:56.990]  It's not, and the gauge is like the thing that it's doing is working fine.
[01:04:57.050 --> 01:04:59.910]  It's just that little, it's this little mechanical thing gets stuck sometimes.
[01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:02.370]  A little floaty.
[01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:05.850]  I don't know if they do it in the movies because it happens in real life,
[01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:09.030]  but I would bet you that it happens in real life because they do it in the movies.
[01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:12.190]  I would love more analog gauges in my life.
[01:05:12.610 --> 01:05:14.230]  Like for internet speed.
[01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:18.470]  Like, you know, when your internet is just getting dog shit and slow for no reason.
[01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:20.470]  I just want to, I just want to see what it's really doing.
[01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:22.090]  You just, you want to tap it.
[01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:24.490]  I want to tap the gauge and see if my internet speeds up.
[01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:25.590]  Oh, is it really that slow?
[01:05:25.650 --> 01:05:29.050]  And then you tap it and it releases and it just starts spinning so fast to the right.
[01:05:30.050 --> 01:05:30.830]  And then all my data goes back.
[01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:32.290]  Oh my God, downloaded everything.
[01:05:32.610 --> 01:05:33.190]  That's exciting.
[01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:37.190]  In the same vein, wouldn't it be cool if you could see,
[01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:44.930]  uh, like how much data you've used on your plan through like a water meter, uh, style, uh, dial.
[01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:46.170]  That just goes...
[01:05:47.090 --> 01:05:48.550]  I love that idea!
[01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:49.290]  Like it's always ticking?
[01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:51.950]  Yeah, I really love that.
[01:05:52.070 --> 01:05:52.570]  Oh man!
[01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.870]  Shut up!
[01:05:53.970 --> 01:05:57.290]  What was that Gavin?
[01:05:57.610 --> 01:05:58.110]  What was...
[01:05:58.110 --> 01:06:01.050]  My freaking soundbar has Alexa in it and I don't know how to...
[01:06:01.050 --> 01:06:01.550]  Oh yeah!
[01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:05.810]  And I say stuff that sounds like that a lot.
[01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:11.210]  Uh, something sort of in that tone. And this might be a thing the truck boys
[01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:15.670]  might be really into, Jeff. Farming Simulator 25 has a collector's edition
[01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:22.450]  that comes with a USB ignition lock that is like a physical lock and you can sync it to your
[01:06:22.450 --> 01:06:28.050]  computer. And when you put the key in and twist it, you can start your tractor in the game by
[01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:35.610]  doing that physical function, which I'm kind of all about. If only, if only that game was
[01:06:35.610 --> 01:06:42.130]  fucking fun to play. I mean, they keep making them. Is there actually fun stuff to do now,
[01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:46.970]  do you think? No, we downloaded it, the truck boys and I downloaded and played it one night
[01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:51.850]  and we all bailed. It just, it was not fun. I wanted it to be... I felt the same way about
[01:06:51.850 --> 01:06:55.170]  SnowRunner though when I first started, like maybe if you push through...
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:05.200]  Was that like a gas meter? Yeah, that's my internet meter for the month.
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:11.420]  I want one of these for podcasting so I can mute you guys whenever I want. It would just,
[01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:16.480]  each switch would assign, like we'd like ascribe to like one of you and I'd be like,
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.320]  I don't want to hear any more of that and I could flip it off.
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:22.670]  So if I were to like, let's say like if I did this, if I...
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:32.300]  We can't, we can't put that in. You'd mute me, right? You'd flip the switch and you'd mute it.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:38.160]  We can't put that in. It's just music. It's just music. No, Eric, I made it. I made that.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:41.440]  Don't worry about it. You keep saying that. I made it.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.660]  I give you a thumbs up, you can use it. I made that. That's not how that works.
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:52.960]  Both thumbs up right now, man. You see these thumbs?
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:58.080]  Look at these fucking thumbs. Two thumbs up. I made that. Don't worry about it.
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:06.760]  Well, there's our, there's our thumbnail. That's me approving of my version of the
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:10.440]  immunity bullet. It's just two thumbs to myself, but I'm very happy about it.
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.460]  I just, I appreciate you. I appreciate someone keeping convict alive. Thank you very much.
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:18.180]  That you're doing that for him. Yeah, I'm doing that. That's me.
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:23.280]  Yep. Do you see what Vin Diesel tweeted or posted on Instagram over Father's Day?
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.780]  Did you see his Father's Day post? No.
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:33.260]  I love Vin Diesel because he's an insane person. Vin Diesel tried to bridge the gap with Putin
[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:36.440]  over Father's Day. What the fuck did you just say?
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:42.680]  Vin Diesel tried to bridge the gap of peace, I guess on a global scale,
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:49.660]  with Putin over Father's Day while also teasing Riddick 4 and concept art for Fast and Furious
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:54.200]  Part 2, 10, Part 2 or 11, whatever it is. All in one tweet?
[01:08:54.660 --> 01:09:02.460]  All in one post. Yeah, it was the first half was like, hey, I'm scouting Riddick 4 in Europe
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:08.940]  right now and look at this cool concept art for the next Fast film. But also when I look out to
[01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:15.400]  the sea, I see warships in the distance. Putin, let's get together. Let's have let's let's get a
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:21.780]  meal. Let's break bread. We could solve this. I wish I had. Let me find let me find his actual.
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:27.620]  He then removed the bottom half about Putin. Yeah, I was going to say I'm looking at it right
[01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:32.880]  now and there's nothing about Putin on here, dude. Is it just the car and the Father's Day thing?
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:39.060]  Because he edited it later. It is. Vin Diesel invites Putin to dinner and Father's Day post.
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:44.480]  Yeah, that's the post. Happy Father's Day to you all. While location scouting in Europe for Riddick,
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:50.440]  the concept art for Fast X Part 2 keeps pouring in. Wait until you see the American road trip.
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:55.260]  Haha. Hashtag Happy Father's Day. OK, so top comment Russian.
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:02.500]  Fourth comment Russian. Now imagine there is another paragraph that was all about Putin
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:09.180]  getting Putin over. Uh, let's find his. OK, so what he edited out was and this is a quote.
[01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:16.120]  On a side note, I saw worship off my country shores. Hmm. I'm not the Tucker type. He wrote.
[01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:22.080]  As a father, my kids live in that country. Hmm. Putin, I will fly to the Caribbean. Come have
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.400]  dinner. Let's not let foolishness dictate the future. Hashtag Happy Father's Day.
[01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:31.740]  Hahaha. You want to have Putin to dinner so that they can deal with this worship situation.
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:35.880]  It sounds like he had to write a tweet based on three things he bought at the store.
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.520]  Yeah. Hahaha.
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:43.520]  I wonder what he bought. A toaster strudel. Hahaha.
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:46.220]  Gave a battleship. Hahaha.
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:53.300]  Anyway, this is a long episode. I'm surprised Eric isn't. You just you just.
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.900]  I have been about three or four times been saying let's wrap up.
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:58.780]  I've just been roundly ignored. Oh, I just haven't noticed it.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:03.000]  Yeah. Cool. Great. First, I've heard of it. But if you want to wrap up, let's go ahead and wrap up.
[01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:09.720]  I guess this is it. Everybody rein it in. Episode's over. It's time to stop doing this
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:14.920]  for the rest of the week. We'll do this again next week. Thanks for listening.
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:21.840]  You know, we love you grinding up on that pole as Andrew is fond of saying in his song.
[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:22.840]  Gavin, what's our URL?
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.040]  Oh, Regulatreon.com.
[01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:34.300]  Oh, my God. Hey, if you haven't checked out our YouTube gaming channel,
[01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:37.160]  go to the regulation gaming channel on YouTube and check out all of our
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:41.740]  stupid videos that don't suck. And we'll see you next week. Bye.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:49.940]  First practice is almost here. Gear up on budget when you shop quality used sports
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:54.700]  equipment at Play It Again Sports. Plus, get paid on the spot for outgrown items.
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:12:00.580]  It's the sustainable way to shop and sell for football, soccer, golf, hockey, and more.
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.700]  Play It Again Sports. Your back to school go-to.
