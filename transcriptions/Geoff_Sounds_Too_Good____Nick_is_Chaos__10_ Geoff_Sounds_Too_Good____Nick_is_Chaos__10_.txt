[00:30.000 --> 00:37.500]  Hey, guys. Gavin's late. Crazy. Not yet. He has seconds. He's got 30 seconds.
[00:37.920 --> 00:42.300]  What? I think it says 11. Yeah, but it's within the minute.
[00:42.960 --> 00:48.500]  Didn't we have a whole run of this on the show? Well, hold on. Hold on. He's got 20 seconds.
[00:48.680 --> 00:51.800]  I didn't get a chance to test my recording. I hope it's going well. I don't want to stop it now.
[00:52.420 --> 00:56.800]  I don't know if I like New Jeff. What does that mean? I'm not sure if I like it.
[00:56.800 --> 01:02.300]  I'm still working on it. I think I think I will like it, but I'm still I'm adjusting.
[01:02.620 --> 01:07.120]  I don't know what that means. I'm the same. He's here. It's on time.
[01:07.560 --> 01:14.980]  Damn it. Oh, man, you really cut. You were cutting it close to turn you up now. And this is
[01:15.780 --> 01:20.560]  not a whole thing. You have to turn me up. I thought I'm not loud enough.
[01:21.060 --> 01:24.580]  I was I turned you down because you're too loud for me. And now I'm turning you.
[01:24.580 --> 01:32.040]  It's hey, Gavin. You OK?
[01:35.300 --> 01:37.240]  He's coming home today, man.
[01:39.400 --> 01:45.200]  What's so funny? You, you. Hello and welcome to another episode of the regulation podcast.
[01:45.620 --> 01:48.120]  My name is Jeff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Pantin, Gavin Free,
[01:48.260 --> 01:51.780]  Nick Schwartz, Eric Baddour. Episode 10. Gavin, you're hilarious.
[01:52.460 --> 01:53.500]  Discord's a piece of shit.
[01:56.780 --> 02:01.180]  I walk away from my computer, right? I walk away. Everything is just left as it was.
[02:02.620 --> 02:07.280]  Discord is minimized, right? And then when I click it on the taskbar, it won't
[02:08.720 --> 02:11.200]  get big again. What's the laugh about?
[02:14.100 --> 02:16.920]  Maybe it's thinking about Cecil Fielder or King Kong Bundy.
[02:18.100 --> 02:19.620]  That's what did it for me in high school.
[02:19.620 --> 02:25.520]  You and freaking King Kong Bundy. You try to maintain an erection thinking about him.
[02:28.580 --> 02:32.280]  How's it going, everyone? I'm good. Nick said whiskey discord.
[02:34.880 --> 02:38.260]  Oh, man. Whiskey discord is great.
[02:40.700 --> 02:43.840]  What do you think of new Jeff Gavin? Because I'm thrown by it.
[02:44.140 --> 02:46.600]  Yeah. What do you think of new Jeff Gavin? What's new about him?
[02:46.600 --> 02:49.680]  He sounds completely different. What are you talking about?
[02:49.920 --> 02:50.700]  All right. Say something, Jeff.
[02:51.260 --> 02:54.180]  Hey, what's up? It's your old pal Jeff sounding completely different,
[02:54.240 --> 02:57.480]  according to Andrew and Eric. He sounds like he's an AM radio host.
[02:58.100 --> 03:02.860]  Nah, he sounds fine. It's not that he sounds bad. I think it is,
[03:03.020 --> 03:07.460]  once again, this is like the widescreen of your voice, where I'm just not used to it.
[03:07.860 --> 03:10.500]  Full spectrum voice. It's a full spectrum Jeff.
[03:10.940 --> 03:15.300]  Oh, man. You're hearing all the notes that other people can't.
[03:15.740 --> 03:20.320]  Uh, yeah, well, I replaced my Scarlett that we initially recorded that I recorded the first
[03:21.500 --> 03:26.760]  215 episodes of this thing with with a road podcaster that immediately broke and I bought
[03:26.760 --> 03:31.060]  a second one, but I got the first one fixed and now I have two road podcasters, one for my PC
[03:31.060 --> 03:37.140]  and one for my Mac. I just I think it's you sound too good, I think, is the problem. Like this.
[03:37.200 --> 03:43.140]  It feels like you're an actual host. Would it help if I would it help if I like I throw you
[03:43.140 --> 03:46.320]  like I could. Hey, wait, guess what?
[03:47.420 --> 03:47.800]  Day.
[03:48.200 --> 03:49.620]  There's old Jeff back there.
[03:50.840 --> 03:55.000]  That's yeah, yeah, I feel like I'm part of not a real production now. Thank you.
[03:55.140 --> 03:56.140]  I'm back to feeling good.
[03:58.640 --> 03:59.020]  Andrew.
[04:00.860 --> 04:03.420]  During our we had a little week off, we had a little break.
[04:04.360 --> 04:06.900]  And you said last time you were not really a break.
[04:07.420 --> 04:09.200]  OK, it worked a lot.
[04:09.840 --> 04:13.060]  Yeah, we did a lot of record. I just want to be clear. It's not like we took a break for
[04:13.060 --> 04:17.300]  a week. We I took a break. Y'all worked your asses off. Yeah, we kept working. But there was
[04:17.300 --> 04:22.680]  a break for this podcast during which in between you said you were going to work on on your desk.
[04:22.820 --> 04:28.200]  How'd you get on? Wow. You really immediately throwing at me, expecting me to have not done
[04:28.200 --> 04:34.080]  a thing, didn't you? You little you little sneaky Brit over there trying to have a lot of time
[04:34.080 --> 04:39.380]  to try to make fun of me. I'm using a new set of two, Gavin. I'm using new setup as well
[04:39.380 --> 04:45.100]  because I remembered my homework. I did my job. Let me I'm going to be honest. It's a little
[04:45.100 --> 04:52.900]  precarious. There might need to be some adjustments done. I went with a Jeff approach. Hell yeah.
[04:53.460 --> 04:58.060]  With the setup, I would say, let me just open up this app on my phone so I could. I took a little
[04:58.060 --> 05:04.340]  photo before we went live. I bet it is a little photo, too. Yeah, it is. It's a half Bundy,
[05:04.340 --> 05:12.340]  I would say. Let me get open this. So I got I bought some clamps
[05:13.980 --> 05:23.260]  in the style that Jeff was suggesting, and I clamped down a piece of wood onto my desk
[05:23.260 --> 05:29.160]  and then I put my mic clamp on that. Oh, my God. So complicated.
[05:30.400 --> 05:33.780]  So I didn't have to nail the desk. I didn't need a hammer.
[05:34.340 --> 05:43.680]  I bought some clamp, but I bought like arts and crafts wood off of Amazon. That's the
[05:44.600 --> 05:53.140]  so that's like 10 little pieces of wood and one thing of so it's not stable. It's really bent
[05:53.140 --> 05:58.940]  upwards. It's a curve. You've crushed a bunch of like thin chipboard together and you've put
[05:58.940 --> 06:04.240]  your mic on top of the barcode part. Well, I mean, I didn't. Yeah, no free ads.
[06:06.000 --> 06:11.520]  Didn't want to scan and buy it themselves. But that's that's my setup. I now can get
[06:11.520 --> 06:18.280]  rid of my table mic stand and maybe look into buying a thicker, more singular piece of wood.
[06:18.840 --> 06:22.280]  But outside of that worked pretty good, I would say. I'd say it's a pretty good solution
[06:22.280 --> 06:28.520]  to the problem. I am impressed and I'm glad it worked. I didn't have to nail anything.
[06:28.520 --> 06:33.180]  I didn't have to put a hole in my desk. I still don't have a drill. I don't need a drill,
[06:33.300 --> 06:37.480]  I don't think. I just I can't believe you don't want to drill for the rest of your life.
[06:37.920 --> 06:42.840]  I just don't. That's a bad combination. You know what they say, Gavin? More drills,
[06:42.980 --> 06:49.740]  more problems. That's what they say. I think there is a permanence to a hole that I do not
[06:49.740 --> 06:54.360]  need in my life. You don't want any holes permanent? No, because I would make a lot of
[06:54.360 --> 07:00.120]  unnecessary holes, I think, or I would do poor holes and then I would have to fix the hole.
[07:00.220 --> 07:04.600]  So I just am better not being in a position to generate holes. OK.
[07:06.580 --> 07:10.360]  I don't know if I ever told you guys this, but when I moved into my old house, the one that I
[07:10.360 --> 07:14.800]  no longer own, I hung a TV in my bedroom, not even thinking, just put up a flat screen TV.
[07:15.240 --> 07:18.640]  I resisted having a TV in the bedroom. Remember, I had the ceiling TV for a long time,
[07:18.680 --> 07:22.980]  but eventually I decided I'd be a real big boy and I put a wall mount on my TV and hung it.
[07:22.980 --> 07:27.800]  And as I hung it and I drilled everything in, I realized I on the other side is my shower and I
[07:27.800 --> 07:36.660]  missed my shower pipe by less than an inch. Oh, my God. Less than an inch. And that's that's why
[07:36.660 --> 07:42.060]  drills may like if you can if you can go your whole life without a drill, Andrew, I recommend it.
[07:42.760 --> 07:50.980]  I I was hanging a towel rail in my bathroom and when I was done, I couldn't close the bathroom
[07:50.980 --> 07:57.940]  door. And it was one of those sliding pocket doors. And I'd attach the towel rail to the
[07:57.940 --> 08:07.760]  closed door inside the wall. Oh, man. So now. That's great. So even though.
[08:09.880 --> 08:14.800]  Even though I replaced the screws with shorter ones. Did you? There are still two holes in
[08:14.800 --> 08:20.180]  my pocket. Did you? Did you have like a solid ten seconds of feeling like a big man
[08:20.180 --> 08:27.120]  fixing the house, doing your own install? And then there must have been so much pride in that moment
[08:27.120 --> 08:32.020]  between finishing and then going to close the door. Yeah, that was probably like a 20 minute
[08:32.020 --> 08:36.380]  period where I felt all big and strong and badly until I couldn't pull the door out of the wall.
[08:37.060 --> 08:41.900]  When you couldn't when the door didn't pull, how long did it actually take for you
[08:42.360 --> 08:45.400]  to connect the dots and how long did it feel like in your head?
[08:46.040 --> 08:48.900]  Oh, I connected the dots instantly when I tugged on the door
[08:48.900 --> 08:53.540]  from the little piece and it just bounced out of my hands. I just went.
[08:53.940 --> 09:00.360]  Do you think that was maybe one of the worst moments of your life in terms of just feeling
[09:00.360 --> 09:09.640]  good about yourself? I'm 20 for sure, because I can't I can't I can't imagine the realization
[09:09.640 --> 09:16.880]  setting in on what I had done in that moment. I think for me, my solution to that problem
[09:16.880 --> 09:20.440]  wouldn't be reapplying it. It would be figuring out a way to make it slide.
[09:20.660 --> 09:24.080]  So your towel rack would just go in and out with the door.
[09:24.280 --> 09:29.000]  Like cutting a channel so that every time I closed it, that would actually work better.
[09:29.180 --> 09:30.540]  Because those fricking...
[09:30.540 --> 09:31.500]  Doing like a slide.
[09:31.680 --> 09:37.520]  Those fiddly fricking little sliding pocket doors are a pain in the ass. If the entire door was run
[09:37.520 --> 09:41.120]  by me sliding my towel rail, it would be much easier to use.
[09:41.680 --> 09:45.880]  I mean, I was just imagining the face of someone who doesn't expect it
[09:45.880 --> 09:51.120]  walking into that bathroom, closing the door behind them and seeing the towel rack just slide.
[09:51.200 --> 09:53.600]  Like the towels are just coming at you as you shut the door.
[09:54.660 --> 09:56.880]  Oh, man.
[09:59.240 --> 10:02.940]  Andrew, earlier you said something about it feeling like not a real production.
[10:03.700 --> 10:07.600]  Speaking of not a real production, can I tell you guys about a TV show I watched the other night?
[10:08.220 --> 10:08.680]  Of course.
[10:09.280 --> 10:15.560]  Hulu has been begging me to watch the show. What is it? The quiz with balls.
[10:15.880 --> 10:22.820]  Every time I load up Hulu, the quiz with balls, they're ramming it down my face.
[10:22.940 --> 10:25.600]  It's a major network show. It's like ABC, NBC, CBS, I don't know.
[10:26.020 --> 10:29.800]  And it's basically what you think it is, is exactly what it is.
[10:30.860 --> 10:33.980]  It's like two families compete in trivia.
[10:34.400 --> 10:39.060]  And then one family goes up and they stand in a slot over a swimming pool.
[10:39.460 --> 10:42.940]  And then behind them on a ramp is a giant ball.
[10:42.940 --> 10:44.800]  And they answer a question.
[10:45.080 --> 10:48.980]  And the one who gets it the most wrong gets shot into the water.
[10:49.460 --> 10:51.700]  Except this image isn't even doing it justice.
[10:51.840 --> 10:58.140]  The episode I watched, they had a family all in denim jeans with big, chunky tennis shoes.
[10:59.340 --> 11:03.620]  And then all they do is get an answer wrong and they just drop them in water.
[11:03.760 --> 11:05.740]  And then they have to swim all the way across this pool.
[11:05.840 --> 11:08.360]  And then a guy in a security guard just gives them a towel.
[11:08.700 --> 11:10.700]  And then they have to go sit on a vinyl sofa.
[11:10.700 --> 11:14.520]  Which must, if you're there, really stink after a while.
[11:14.820 --> 11:19.740]  And just be like a thousand wet farting sounds because they're just sliding all over vinyl.
[11:19.980 --> 11:25.200]  It was one of the dumbest things I've ever seen in my entire life.
[11:25.360 --> 11:28.560]  And I can't fucking believe it got made.
[11:30.300 --> 11:34.360]  They pitched it and somebody said, yeah, that's a good pitch.
[11:34.480 --> 11:39.200]  Yeah, and then they built a giant freaking swimming pool set that probably cost millions of dollars.
[11:39.200 --> 11:40.860]  Cost millions of dollars.
[11:41.080 --> 11:43.960]  So somebody could say, name five cities in Ohio.
[11:44.440 --> 11:46.260]  And then one person gets one wrong.
[11:46.320 --> 11:50.080]  And then they just throw them in the water and make them swim in full clothes.
[11:50.480 --> 11:51.280]  Heavy ass denim.
[11:52.080 --> 11:57.860]  America has this real fascination with feeling like they need to make trivia more exciting.
[11:58.400 --> 12:00.400]  What was the Ellen DeGeneres show?
[12:00.740 --> 12:03.440]  Where like, if you got it wrong, you got ripped into the sky.
[12:03.840 --> 12:04.880]  Like there is...
[12:04.880 --> 12:06.840]  They dropped you like 20 feet sometimes.
[12:06.920 --> 12:07.820]  That was insane.
[12:07.820 --> 12:10.800]  It was the game of games or something.
[12:11.140 --> 12:12.220]  I have no idea what that's called.
[12:12.340 --> 12:17.720]  But there is a history of something stupid happening to you if you get it wrong.
[12:17.860 --> 12:20.580]  Yeah, I feel like I could make a much cheaper show though.
[12:20.680 --> 12:24.420]  I could make like, I could make the quiz with fists and everyone's just stood up
[12:24.420 --> 12:28.580]  facing a hole in a wall and a freaking boxing glove just rocks them if they get it wrong.
[12:28.780 --> 12:31.100]  Or even just the quiz with push.
[12:32.160 --> 12:34.080]  And there's just five people standing behind you.
[12:34.140 --> 12:34.920]  One of them pushes you.
[12:34.920 --> 12:35.500]  It's like...
[12:36.980 --> 12:39.740]  It's just such a bad, lame premise.
[12:39.860 --> 12:41.680]  They're like, what's funny about Wipeout?
[12:41.760 --> 12:42.540]  People getting hit.
[12:42.660 --> 12:44.400]  Okay, what's funny about quiz shows?
[12:44.480 --> 12:44.720]  Nothing.
[12:44.900 --> 12:46.320]  Well, just slam it together.
[12:46.520 --> 12:47.320]  Everybody can swim, right?
[12:47.640 --> 12:50.640]  I just, it was so fucking, just so bad.
[12:50.760 --> 12:51.880]  And I just can't believe...
[12:52.660 --> 12:53.400]  Oh, it's on Fox.
[12:53.500 --> 12:53.900]  I'm sorry.
[12:54.440 --> 12:59.340]  It must cost, like, you know how much, how many millions of dollars they invest in an
[12:59.340 --> 13:01.760]  episode of the quiz with balls?
[13:02.500 --> 13:07.320]  So that Jay Pharoah can do like a fucking Wesley Snipes impression three times or whatever,
[13:07.420 --> 13:08.020]  because he's the host.
[13:08.240 --> 13:09.560]  Like, Jesus Christ.
[13:09.580 --> 13:12.960]  I had the trailer rammed down my throat on autoplay so many times.
[13:13.140 --> 13:18.000]  I just put an episode on and I fast forwarded until I could see someone get hit with a ball.
[13:18.320 --> 13:21.700]  It was like 13 minutes in before someone got balled.
[13:22.180 --> 13:23.200]  It's a bad ball ratio.
[13:23.560 --> 13:26.040]  There's only like eight questions in the whole show.
[13:27.900 --> 13:31.000]  I think what they need to do, let me try to punch up this show a little bit.
[13:31.560 --> 13:36.840]  You stand at the top and if you get it wrong, the boulder falls and you have to outrun the
[13:36.840 --> 13:41.860]  boulder and each lane gets progressively more steep.
[13:42.440 --> 13:45.800]  And if you get hit by the boulder, you're dead and you're never seen again on the show.
[13:46.140 --> 13:49.560]  If you... yeah, that's a good idea.
[13:49.640 --> 13:51.380]  If you get Indiana Jones in, I like that.
[13:51.620 --> 13:56.220]  But as it stands right now, it is the lamest fucking premise for television.
[13:56.360 --> 14:00.100]  And you're just looking at it and you're thinking, like, there's a studio executive somewhere who
[14:00.100 --> 14:02.380]  makes over a million dollars a year.
[14:02.780 --> 14:05.100]  And his job is just to say yes to that.
[14:05.380 --> 14:05.740]  Or her.
[14:05.960 --> 14:09.360]  Their job is just to say yes to that and go, all right, that's a hit.
[14:09.860 --> 14:13.360]  Maybe if you were covered head to toe in gasoline and the ball was on fire,
[14:13.700 --> 14:17.260]  as you were falling, become on fire before being extinguished.
[14:17.380 --> 14:18.460]  That's a show I would watch.
[14:18.920 --> 14:19.080]  Yeah.
[14:19.660 --> 14:22.840]  What if somebody else has to run for you, like someone in your family?
[14:23.060 --> 14:28.180]  Like if you get it wrong, it then triggers for your family to have to outrun the ball of fire.
[14:28.800 --> 14:29.920]  Even more snakes.
[14:29.980 --> 14:30.940]  It's not even just you.
[14:31.240 --> 14:35.160]  I like that idea that the whole like military idea of we don't punish you.
[14:35.260 --> 14:36.340]  We punish the people around you.
[14:36.680 --> 14:37.140]  Yeah, exactly.
[14:37.440 --> 14:37.760]  Yeah.
[14:38.300 --> 14:42.600]  And then once one of your family members gets knocked in, you get railed with soap in a sock.
[14:42.820 --> 14:43.260]  Yeah.
[14:43.380 --> 14:46.720]  And then at about 2 a.m., you get a blanket party and it's not fun.
[14:48.440 --> 14:50.100]  What was the remote control?
[14:50.260 --> 14:53.080]  Was that the MTV Colin Quinn old trivia?
[14:53.300 --> 14:53.480]  Yeah.
[14:53.600 --> 14:57.000]  That had a great exit if you got it wrong from trivia thing.
[14:57.000 --> 14:58.100]  That might be my favorite.
[14:58.100 --> 14:58.420]  What was it? I don't remember.
[14:58.960 --> 15:01.100]  They all sat in like Lazy Boys.
[15:01.360 --> 15:03.420]  And if they got it wrong, the wall ate them.
[15:03.920 --> 15:06.300]  Like the chairs went up and the wall absorbed them.
[15:06.900 --> 15:12.140]  Yeah, they did that on that reality show villain.
[15:13.200 --> 15:14.280]  Oh, awesome.
[15:14.740 --> 15:18.720]  The one hosted by not Daniel Tosh, but the other Daniel Tosh.
[15:20.360 --> 15:20.700]  What's his name?
[15:20.860 --> 15:21.080]  Michael?
[15:21.520 --> 15:23.360]  No, the other Daniel Tosh.
[15:23.880 --> 15:27.500]  Uh, the Anthony Jesalek.
[15:28.080 --> 15:29.360]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:30.300 --> 15:32.220]  And I never watched the villains one.
[15:32.400 --> 15:33.660]  I was really excited about that premise.
[15:33.820 --> 15:34.380]  It wasn't very good.
[15:34.440 --> 15:36.320]  I only watched like two episodes and it was pretty bad.
[15:36.340 --> 15:36.780]  Oh, that's too bad.
[15:38.040 --> 15:41.100]  There's some great clips from it, but maybe a clip show.
[15:41.560 --> 15:43.140]  I think they're doing a second season, too.
[15:43.200 --> 15:44.740]  So it might be worth going back and finishing.
[15:44.980 --> 15:45.460]  I don't know.
[15:46.200 --> 15:49.340]  Hey, Gav, you know, like you used to when you would come to America,
[15:49.340 --> 15:54.720]  you would talk about how the shits in America were so much worse than the shits in England.
[15:54.980 --> 15:55.840]  And it was like instant.
[15:56.020 --> 15:58.060]  Like as soon as you got into America, you just started.
[15:58.300 --> 15:59.960]  Your shit just became like 10 times worse.
[16:00.580 --> 16:02.260]  So funny you mention that because I've had a morning.
[16:04.940 --> 16:06.580]  You got the England shits?
[16:07.520 --> 16:09.760]  You got the coming home stress shits right now.
[16:09.980 --> 16:12.020]  I guess I had some bad Italian food last night.
[16:12.260 --> 16:13.900]  And oh, where'd you eat?
[16:14.300 --> 16:15.480]  I don't know.
[16:16.420 --> 16:17.040]  I didn't go out.
[16:17.120 --> 16:18.260]  It was order in and I didn't order.
[16:18.260 --> 16:21.980]  OK, well, I I'm sorry to hear about your morning.
[16:22.180 --> 16:23.560]  I hope it improves for you.
[16:23.900 --> 16:26.280]  I would take some Pepto Bismol if I were you.
[16:26.720 --> 16:31.180]  I realized this last week in Michigan that Michigan is my America.
[16:31.520 --> 16:32.520]  It makes you shit?
[16:33.160 --> 16:35.440]  Oh, my God, dude.
[16:35.500 --> 16:39.940]  The diarrhea, the the torment.
[16:40.200 --> 16:43.240]  I put Emily's parents toilet through.
[16:45.860 --> 16:48.260]  It I felt bad, man.
[16:48.340 --> 16:53.860]  I was doing like full scrubs every time I I was like doing a full like bathroom clean
[16:53.860 --> 16:55.000]  down because these are my in-laws.
[16:55.340 --> 17:03.420]  But I was having like like you like I was having like you stole a bunch of marked bills
[17:03.420 --> 17:08.280]  in a bag from the from the bank and finally get to your safe house and you open it up
[17:08.280 --> 17:09.600]  and you get hit with the pink spray.
[17:09.880 --> 17:10.640]  The dye pack.
[17:10.640 --> 17:15.580]  Yeah, that was me four times a day for the eight days I was there.
[17:16.900 --> 17:20.500]  And I realized there is nothing.
[17:20.840 --> 17:26.040]  There's nothing that makes an airplane flight longer, maybe shitting your pants seven times
[17:26.040 --> 17:30.060]  like the time you did it, but then just trying not to shit your pants, but also being like,
[17:30.100 --> 17:36.180]  I can't go on the plane because there's not enough toilet paper and distance from other
[17:36.180 --> 17:39.300]  people to make this like a like survivable.
[17:39.300 --> 17:44.360]  So just like trying to hold in a diarrhea for two and a half hours on a plane is brutal.
[17:44.360 --> 17:50.760]  And I was so out of sorts that when I got up, I had like Emily's bag behind me and my
[17:50.760 --> 17:52.660]  bag in front of me and she was moving on.
[17:52.720 --> 17:54.960]  And, you know, everybody's like cramming to put it to get out of there.
[17:55.100 --> 17:56.860]  And like it was like, oh, can you got my purse?
[17:57.100 --> 17:59.140]  And I like spun around to grab her purse.
[17:59.180 --> 18:04.740]  And somehow I flipped myself around, got both of my arms caught behind myself, and I fell
[18:04.740 --> 18:10.500]  into a row of chairs face first, landed on my, you know, like on the middle row, the
[18:10.500 --> 18:15.140]  crossbar, like the arm support, landed chest onto that with my head over it.
[18:15.220 --> 18:19.420]  And because my hand was like trapped under me and behind me, I couldn't push myself off
[18:19.420 --> 18:21.760]  and my legs were wedged in between the suitcases.
[18:21.940 --> 18:25.800]  And I just kind of had to lay there for like three seconds to try to figure out how to
[18:25.800 --> 18:29.460]  get out of there while the people around me did that thing where they started laughing
[18:29.460 --> 18:34.300]  and then they stopped laughing because it suddenly wasn't funny because they didn't
[18:34.300 --> 18:38.440]  know if I was hurt or, you know, or if they needed to help me or not.
[18:38.540 --> 18:42.420]  And I was clearly holding people back and the whole time just laying there trying to
[18:42.420 --> 18:45.120]  figure out how to get out of there and hold my diarrhea in.
[18:45.860 --> 18:49.940]  So you were like, you were like a turtle on its back, like trying not to shit.
[18:50.420 --> 18:54.300]  I was like a turtle on its back trying not to shit, but I was a Jeff on my face trying
[18:54.300 --> 18:54.780]  not to shit.
[18:56.700 --> 18:58.820]  And Emily took off like she didn't see it.
[18:59.180 --> 19:00.560]  So she was like, I heard a commotion.
[19:00.560 --> 19:04.160]  And by the time I caught up with her with like her, like 80 bags and like, you know,
[19:04.180 --> 19:06.580]  holding my butthole together, it was, uh, it was rough.
[19:06.860 --> 19:07.880]  But that row was empty, right?
[19:08.420 --> 19:09.380]  Yeah, thank God.
[19:09.560 --> 19:12.520]  Because I was going into it like regardless.
[19:13.220 --> 19:17.340]  It, uh, it's hard to push yourself off when you're trapped under your arms and your chest
[19:17.340 --> 19:19.460]  is like hanging over a ledge.
[19:19.920 --> 19:20.220]  Yeah.
[19:20.380 --> 19:22.920]  And you're still not shitting.
[19:24.760 --> 19:29.980]  My non-shitting flight from LA to Austin took what felt like nine hours, even though it was
[19:29.980 --> 19:32.260]  man, probably a three hour flight.
[19:32.500 --> 19:34.020]  Just locked in and not shitting.
[19:34.260 --> 19:35.080]  It's all you're thinking about.
[19:36.500 --> 19:39.340]  Physically sat on my hands, holding my anus closed.
[19:39.720 --> 19:42.660]  And then, uh, and then losing grip on it when I fell asleep.
[19:43.180 --> 19:45.700]  I didn't use headphones because it was too much.
[19:45.880 --> 19:46.820]  Like it was just too much.
[19:47.160 --> 19:48.460]  Too much of a distraction away from your eyes.
[19:48.480 --> 19:52.120]  Yeah, I just read Reddit on my phone because like the noise was too much for focusing.
[19:52.660 --> 19:55.180]  I tend to like, that was like that intense.
[19:57.940 --> 19:59.180]  Anyway, so that was my week.
[19:59.180 --> 20:01.940]  It sounds like y'all y'all had a lot of fun playing video games.
[20:02.380 --> 20:03.580]  We played a lot of video games.
[20:03.900 --> 20:05.400]  I've been watching soccer.
[20:05.920 --> 20:07.920]  I've become a little bit of a soccer fan.
[20:07.980 --> 20:09.600]  I feel like everyone's getting into it.
[20:09.920 --> 20:11.400]  I saw Canada play last night.
[20:11.720 --> 20:11.880]  Yeah.
[20:12.060 --> 20:13.300]  Oh, yeah, it was.
[20:13.840 --> 20:15.660]  They scored a goal in this tournament.
[20:15.840 --> 20:18.800]  So they were in Copa America and they scored a goal for the first time.
[20:19.040 --> 20:19.960]  That was very exciting.
[20:20.360 --> 20:22.900]  They made it to the semifinals, which is very exciting.
[20:23.020 --> 20:23.900]  Played against Argentina.
[20:24.360 --> 20:28.020]  It looked really good for about five minutes and then it never looked good again.
[20:28.280 --> 20:28.840]  That was it.
[20:28.840 --> 20:36.760]  But as as somebody who didn't like draws in soccer, following a team that has low expectations,
[20:37.500 --> 20:42.900]  the possibility of a tie is so exciting because it's just like we just got to prevent a goal.
[20:43.280 --> 20:46.500]  It's starting in a position where we could technically kind of win.
[20:47.160 --> 20:48.060]  And it's great.
[20:48.640 --> 20:51.520]  And if you force a tie all the way to penalties, that's that's well exciting.
[20:51.620 --> 20:52.460]  Anyone could win that.
[20:52.880 --> 20:53.260]  Exactly.
[20:53.300 --> 20:56.640]  Yeah, it feels like penalties is like a complete coin flip.
[20:56.640 --> 21:02.260]  So even when there's not penalties, just the ability of like, OK, we just have to do nothing.
[21:02.400 --> 21:07.000]  As long as nobody does anything, we can still have a favorable result.
[21:08.060 --> 21:08.520]  And I'm a fan.
[21:09.180 --> 21:10.160]  It's been a lot of fun to watch.
[21:10.540 --> 21:17.640]  I did, however, didn't know that Copa America and the Euro are two different things.
[21:18.220 --> 21:19.080]  I learned that.
[21:19.340 --> 21:20.840]  Two different names didn't give that.
[21:20.840 --> 21:27.500]  I thought maybe it was like a sub name, like it was the Euro Copa America because it was in
[21:28.020 --> 21:30.720]  in like a like it was in somewhere else.
[21:31.240 --> 21:36.340]  If that makes any sense, because I've been waiting for the possibility of England and
[21:36.340 --> 21:37.940]  Canada to go up against each other.
[21:38.140 --> 21:41.240]  That's why I was passively watching before this point.
[21:41.280 --> 21:43.460]  I was like, huh, England keeps winning, Canada keeps winning.
[21:43.560 --> 21:44.240]  This is going to be great.
[21:44.500 --> 21:47.340]  They're eventually going to get matched up the way it's going.
[21:47.800 --> 21:50.760]  What you're thinking of is the World Cup.
[21:51.680 --> 21:54.720]  Yeah, that's what I thought both of those were.
[21:54.980 --> 21:57.940]  I thought I was watching the World Cup and we're all playing for the World Cup.
[21:58.420 --> 21:59.160]  That's in two years.
[21:59.960 --> 22:00.340]  Okay.
[22:00.900 --> 22:03.980]  But I mean, if Canada qualify and England qualify, it could happen.
[22:04.400 --> 22:07.460]  But I've been following it and then Canada won to go to the semifinal
[22:07.460 --> 22:09.360]  and they're matched up against Argentina.
[22:09.580 --> 22:10.880]  And I was like, what the fuck?
[22:10.960 --> 22:11.760]  Where is England?
[22:12.240 --> 22:15.640]  And so I googled bracket for the Copa America tournament
[22:15.640 --> 22:18.660]  and didn't see England there, but knew they were still active.
[22:19.000 --> 22:22.260]  And then I realized, oh, no, this was never going to happen.
[22:22.600 --> 22:24.380]  I was never going to get my matchup against Gavin.
[22:24.760 --> 22:29.020]  It was amazing that Canada was who you said had just scored a goal
[22:29.020 --> 22:30.380]  in the tournament for the first time
[22:30.380 --> 22:34.700]  playing against the winners of the World Cup last year or the year before.
[22:34.880 --> 22:41.640]  What if we had a Copa Euro friendly where you guys play against each other in FIFA?
[22:42.140 --> 22:43.120]  That's what I've been saying.
[22:43.320 --> 22:44.360]  I'm trying to get that together.
[22:44.360 --> 22:48.440]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[22:48.760 --> 22:51.640]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[22:51.800 --> 22:55.320]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[22:55.700 --> 22:57.180]  Available for a limited time.
[22:57.440 --> 22:59.460]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[23:00.540 --> 23:03.240]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm.
[23:03.620 --> 23:06.900]  Checking off the boxes on your to-do list is a great feeling.
[23:07.300 --> 23:09.120]  And when it comes to checking off coverage,
[23:09.320 --> 23:12.540]  a State Farm agent can help you choose an option that's right for you.
[23:12.540 --> 23:17.000]  Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone, or using the award-winning app,
[23:17.240 --> 23:20.720]  it's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[23:21.060 --> 23:23.000]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[23:26.450 --> 23:27.970]  Are we playing or simming it?
[23:28.350 --> 23:29.110]  Well, who have you been playing it to?
[23:29.150 --> 23:30.270]  Because this is the first time I'm hearing it.
[23:30.310 --> 23:31.430]  It sounds like Gavin hasn't heard it either.
[23:31.690 --> 23:33.490]  No, I've been trying to get Gavin to do it for a week.
[23:33.550 --> 23:35.910]  I texted Gavin and Nick can back me up on this.
[23:36.310 --> 23:37.450]  I said, when are we doing it?
[23:37.450 --> 23:39.030]  And you said, we're not doing it yet.
[23:40.590 --> 23:41.270]  Yeah, well...
[23:42.550 --> 23:45.330]  No, here, let's circle back on this.
[23:45.390 --> 23:49.230]  Wait, you just called him on that and he said, yeah, no, well, that's awesome.
[23:49.350 --> 23:50.230]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[23:50.390 --> 23:51.610]  Shut the fuck up, Eric.
[23:54.130 --> 23:55.250]  Let me go.
[23:55.470 --> 23:57.030]  You fucking idiot, Eric.
[23:57.110 --> 23:58.630]  Let me go full Nick or whatever Nick said.
[23:58.670 --> 24:00.970]  Eric said like three words this whole podcast.
[24:00.970 --> 24:03.450]  I just repeated what you said, Andrew.
[24:03.510 --> 24:05.790]  Yeah, but you tried to make a point of this is a whole...
[24:05.790 --> 24:07.370]  We're going to get into a whole lot of garbage here.
[24:07.870 --> 24:08.250]  Oh goodness.
[24:08.250 --> 24:08.970]  I texted.
[24:09.290 --> 24:12.850]  I was in a group text with you, Nick and Gavin trying to get this done.
[24:13.450 --> 24:15.030]  Gavin never replied, true or false?
[24:15.350 --> 24:16.250]  He did not reply.
[24:16.610 --> 24:17.630]  He never replied.
[24:17.750 --> 24:18.910]  He didn't acknowledge, didn't reply.
[24:19.130 --> 24:19.330]  On text?
[24:19.550 --> 24:20.050]  On the schedule.
[24:20.430 --> 24:21.550]  Yes, on text.
[24:21.630 --> 24:23.030]  I can't text you.
[24:23.130 --> 24:23.830]  I have no signal.
[24:23.930 --> 24:25.030]  I don't know what to do about it.
[24:25.110 --> 24:26.730]  I have to hold my...
[24:26.730 --> 24:29.850]  I have to go upstairs and hold my phone above my head because it doesn't use the internet.
[24:29.970 --> 24:31.090]  It uses freaking cellular.
[24:31.650 --> 24:32.390]  I can't...
[24:32.390 --> 24:33.450]  Slack me, you idiot.
[24:33.890 --> 24:34.670]  We work together.
[24:35.770 --> 24:38.330]  We've been texting for years.
[24:39.190 --> 24:39.990]  Four years.
[24:40.410 --> 24:41.370]  I walk away from my...
[24:41.370 --> 24:44.010]  I come back to my phone and something I sent an hour ago hasn't...
[24:44.010 --> 24:49.910]  I don't have as many freaking red exclamation marks as I do with anyone else as I do with you.
[24:50.510 --> 24:51.070]  Okay, that's fair.
[24:51.150 --> 24:52.710]  I'll Slack you from now going forward.
[24:53.150 --> 24:53.670]  I just want...
[24:53.670 --> 24:54.790]  I want to get a group text going.
[24:55.090 --> 24:55.570]  Nick replied.
[24:55.630 --> 24:56.250]  You didn't reply.
[24:57.230 --> 24:59.430]  Understandable that you weren't able to see it.
[24:59.910 --> 25:00.970]  I'm just saying I tried.
[25:01.230 --> 25:02.190]  That's what I want to clear up.
[25:02.190 --> 25:04.910]  What makes you switch out of Slack into texting?
[25:06.210 --> 25:07.510]  You're still talking about work.
[25:08.070 --> 25:13.150]  Yeah, I'd swap to text because I didn't feel like making a group chat in Slack.
[25:13.570 --> 25:14.730]  And also, it was a weekend.
[25:15.150 --> 25:16.190]  So I wanted to reach you.
[25:17.750 --> 25:19.670]  Don't know how any of those qualifies.
[25:20.130 --> 25:21.490]  Can you settle something for me, Andrew?
[25:21.590 --> 25:22.850]  Do you have Slack on your phone?
[25:23.510 --> 25:24.310]  Yeah, yeah, I do.
[25:24.690 --> 25:25.010]  Of course.
[25:25.330 --> 25:25.410]  Okay.
[25:25.650 --> 25:26.410]  Wait, why would I?
[25:27.710 --> 25:28.410]  What do you mean?
[25:29.570 --> 25:31.050]  So it's on the UmiDigi?
[25:31.050 --> 25:32.550]  We need to...
[25:32.550 --> 25:33.350]  It's on the Bison, yeah.
[25:33.890 --> 25:36.270]  We need to talk about what happened in the general chat.
[25:36.670 --> 25:37.750]  What the fuck?
[25:38.930 --> 25:40.390]  In the general chat?
[25:40.430 --> 25:41.090]  Oh, the messages?
[25:42.030 --> 25:43.190]  Let me put a screenshot.
[25:46.870 --> 25:47.950]  Screenshot going in.
[25:51.570 --> 25:52.050]  Yeah.
[25:53.350 --> 25:54.230]  Yeah, you got it.
[25:54.650 --> 25:56.450]  Yeah, there were a bunch of messages.
[25:56.750 --> 25:57.690]  My mom was over.
[25:58.270 --> 26:00.550]  I decided to do some cleaning that I wasn't aware of.
[26:00.550 --> 26:03.550]  And I didn't...
[26:03.550 --> 26:04.970]  I wasn't paying attention to my phone.
[26:05.050 --> 26:06.310]  And then like an hour later, I looked.
[26:06.810 --> 26:08.610]  And Eric thought I got hacked.
[26:10.930 --> 26:14.450]  Because my mom decided to clean my desk area,
[26:14.710 --> 26:16.570]  which included wiping down my keyboard.
[26:17.430 --> 26:20.990]  I love that you can see where she started.
[26:21.130 --> 26:23.590]  She did the number row and then she did QWERTY.
[26:23.770 --> 26:25.610]  And she was doing it row by row.
[26:25.870 --> 26:27.310]  And then she starts again.
[26:27.770 --> 26:29.390]  She gave it all a second pass.
[26:30.710 --> 26:31.750]  That's a really good point.
[26:31.930 --> 26:32.750]  I was very confused.
[26:32.870 --> 26:35.150]  I was very worried when I saw where you hacked.
[26:35.690 --> 26:38.990]  Because that was all the only context I had for what had happened.
[26:39.590 --> 26:41.770]  And then I figured it out.
[26:41.970 --> 26:45.070]  My point is, is that we were all slacking in there talking,
[26:45.290 --> 26:46.710]  like asking you if you're all right.
[26:46.870 --> 26:47.410]  What's going on?
[26:47.470 --> 26:50.530]  At one point, I thought you were falling down the longest flight of stairs in the world.
[26:50.750 --> 26:54.070]  And then you text us saying where we were.
[26:54.170 --> 26:55.570]  We let you know what was happening.
[26:55.630 --> 26:57.490]  And you text us saying, where am I typing that?
[26:57.490 --> 27:02.230]  So you were on your phone, I guess, ignoring all the slack, but replying to all the text.
[27:02.570 --> 27:03.510]  I didn't have the alerts.
[27:03.730 --> 27:05.230]  I didn't have slack alerts for that.
[27:05.790 --> 27:06.210]  I don't know.
[27:07.050 --> 27:08.210]  I don't know what to tell you.
[27:08.250 --> 27:08.970]  I didn't see it.
[27:09.670 --> 27:12.910]  If I would have had the alerts, I would have known where I was typing.
[27:13.490 --> 27:15.390]  I didn't just ignore the alerts.
[27:15.690 --> 27:18.810]  There was no notification for any of your messages.
[27:19.270 --> 27:23.530]  The only thing I had was Eric saying, were you hacked?
[27:24.370 --> 27:25.890]  And maybe it was there, Gavin.
[27:25.890 --> 27:29.190]  But if you have a text that says, Andrew, were you hacked?
[27:29.630 --> 27:32.170]  Everything else becomes less of a priority.
[27:32.550 --> 27:35.230]  You're immediately going there for more info.
[27:35.690 --> 27:38.150]  I'm not being like, oh, Eric thinks I'm hacked.
[27:38.230 --> 27:38.550]  Whatever.
[27:38.710 --> 27:40.190]  Let me see what else is going on.
[27:40.450 --> 27:42.110]  Let's browse a little bit.
[27:42.530 --> 27:47.470]  I immediately responded to the source of my hacking.
[27:49.050 --> 27:52.470]  Isn't it weird that you don't have alerts on for our slack though?
[27:52.850 --> 27:53.930]  No, I do have alerts.
[27:53.930 --> 27:58.470]  As I was talking through that, I think that realistically is more what happened.
[27:58.710 --> 28:01.050]  I saw, were you hacked?
[28:01.150 --> 28:07.390]  And immediately just followed that thread in a panic as opposed to just looking because I didn't know.
[28:07.410 --> 28:10.010]  So you do or you don't have alerts?
[28:10.290 --> 28:11.390]  Of course I have alerts.
[28:11.990 --> 28:14.330]  The only time I don't get alerts is when...
[28:14.630 --> 28:16.450]  You can't say of course at any time.
[28:16.970 --> 28:19.150]  Didn't he just say that he didn't have alerts?
[28:19.530 --> 28:20.510]  I feel crazy.
[28:21.150 --> 28:23.430]  Not I didn't have alerts in a permanent sense.
[28:23.430 --> 28:25.430]  I thought I didn't have alerts on my phone.
[28:25.530 --> 28:28.790]  Like the UmiDigi maybe didn't push those alerts to it.
[28:28.970 --> 28:30.090]  But it probably did.
[28:30.250 --> 28:33.710]  I just wasn't aware of that because I saw, were you hacked?
[28:33.830 --> 28:37.530]  And immediately went into panic mode to try to figure out what you were talking about.
[28:38.330 --> 28:44.050]  Well, either way, it's good to know that you have Slack open on an unlocked computer without a
[28:44.050 --> 28:44.430]  screensaver.
[28:45.090 --> 28:46.710]  Well, it's just it's on my...
[28:46.710 --> 28:47.910]  It's yeah, it's my computer.
[28:48.070 --> 28:48.130]  What?
[28:48.610 --> 28:51.810]  Are you afraid people are going to find out of all of our secrets?
[28:54.110 --> 28:56.570]  Inofficial farts and cool images.
[28:57.150 --> 28:58.850]  Some of those farts are just for us.
[29:00.870 --> 29:01.810]  Let me circle.
[29:02.170 --> 29:05.290]  Well, I got some I got some beef with Gavin in this Slack situation.
[29:05.430 --> 29:06.610]  We got some Slack issues.
[29:07.030 --> 29:07.730]  You're riled me.
[29:07.970 --> 29:09.430]  I'm riled up now about this.
[29:09.490 --> 29:10.230]  I was riled up yesterday.
[29:10.370 --> 29:11.190]  I took strays.
[29:11.430 --> 29:13.210]  I don't think I've ever been more right about anything.
[29:13.610 --> 29:15.650]  We have a Monday meeting.
[29:15.750 --> 29:21.770]  We get together once a week on Monday and it is at what time is it?
[29:21.770 --> 29:22.650]  8.30 a.m.
[29:23.190 --> 29:23.930]  10.30 for us.
[29:24.050 --> 29:25.890]  10.30 for you.
[29:26.490 --> 29:28.050]  OK, first week.
[29:28.290 --> 29:30.190]  And I'm just I'm vocalizing this.
[29:30.310 --> 29:32.370]  Just I'm not saying this is anyone's fault, but mine.
[29:32.830 --> 29:34.450]  First week couldn't sleep.
[29:34.710 --> 29:35.630]  Mind was racing.
[29:35.990 --> 29:39.110]  I decided that I would be better off like because I tried.
[29:39.390 --> 29:42.050]  I put in I just laid in bed and closed my eyes for hours.
[29:42.410 --> 29:43.130]  Nothing was happening.
[29:43.490 --> 29:48.490]  I decided, hey, I'm just going to stay up the rest of the night, knock out this meeting,
[29:48.490 --> 29:49.570]  and then I'll be so tired.
[29:49.610 --> 29:50.490]  I'll have to sleep.
[29:50.490 --> 29:52.610]  I get a few hours and I can go about my day.
[29:52.750 --> 29:54.410]  So what time is it when you decide this?
[29:54.910 --> 29:56.050]  Probably 5 a.m.
[29:56.330 --> 29:57.530]  5.30 a.m.
[29:57.530 --> 30:00.930]  I'd say, and I'd been trying to sleep from like one to four at that point.
[30:01.450 --> 30:03.190]  And I'd given up by five.
[30:04.850 --> 30:06.030]  Give up by five.
[30:06.610 --> 30:07.430]  7 a.m.
[30:07.910 --> 30:08.970]  Hour before the meeting.
[30:09.530 --> 30:10.250]  Eric posts.
[30:11.310 --> 30:11.970]  I think it was Eric.
[30:12.290 --> 30:12.890]  I don't remember.
[30:12.970 --> 30:14.570]  I shouldn't call it Eric because I don't remember the specific.
[30:14.970 --> 30:17.790]  Somebody said, let's know is you, Gavin.
[30:18.130 --> 30:19.770]  You said, let's reschedule the meeting.
[30:19.770 --> 30:21.730]  I have a thing on at that time.
[30:22.070 --> 30:24.650]  And it was a thing that existed prior to that.
[30:25.090 --> 30:26.050]  And I went, oh, I'm fucked.
[30:26.430 --> 30:27.310]  I stayed up all night.
[30:27.470 --> 30:28.750]  I didn't blame you for that.
[30:29.090 --> 30:31.270]  It was more just like, oh, that's an annoyance.
[30:31.970 --> 30:33.690]  That also is information you knew.
[30:33.830 --> 30:39.570]  We could have, if that was just vocalized a day prior, we could have just completely avoided this.
[30:40.110 --> 30:40.810]  Week two.
[30:41.490 --> 30:46.030]  Don't remember what happens with this meeting, but something happens and we don't have it at the time.
[30:46.130 --> 30:46.810]  It has to be moved.
[30:47.430 --> 30:48.350]  Week three.
[30:49.130 --> 30:55.230]  There's another rescheduling that is an hour before the meeting starts.
[30:55.510 --> 31:00.930]  But the problem is I don't have an alarm set until eight because my partner works nights
[31:00.930 --> 31:03.990]  and I have my setup in our bedroom.
[31:04.250 --> 31:08.970]  So I have to we both have to be up or I will wake them up just naturally.
[31:10.590 --> 31:14.130]  And so I said, let's can we move the meeting an hour?
[31:14.770 --> 31:19.370]  Because we're giving you're giving updates on the meeting is moved,
[31:19.550 --> 31:23.150]  but it's pointless to me because I don't wake up until an hour later.
[31:23.330 --> 31:28.230]  So now I'm just waking up to see that a meeting that would never had a chance of happening
[31:28.230 --> 31:29.550]  is not happening.
[31:31.750 --> 31:33.630]  How am I in the wrong on this?
[31:33.730 --> 31:37.230]  I've been getting shit on for this for like four days.
[31:38.550 --> 31:40.270]  Well, it's the daytime.
[31:40.970 --> 31:45.810]  It's eight a.m. here and my partner works nights.
[31:46.510 --> 31:52.350]  Yeah, so that means that they go to bed late and then they sleep
[31:52.350 --> 31:55.390]  ideally through the first half of the day.
[31:55.650 --> 31:58.130]  Technically, they probably go to bed early, I would think.
[31:58.790 --> 31:59.870]  Yeah, sure, sure.
[32:00.130 --> 32:01.290]  But you got to wake up.
[32:01.450 --> 32:03.710]  So you're saying it should be later or we shouldn't move it?
[32:03.710 --> 32:07.870]  I'm saying we I'm saying that I wanted it moved an hour
[32:07.870 --> 32:14.250]  because you don't give updates on your schedule until an hour before it happens,
[32:14.250 --> 32:17.810]  at which point it's irrelevant to me because I'm sleeping
[32:17.810 --> 32:21.770]  and I'm going to wake up in an hour to see that I didn't need to wake up at all.
[32:22.030 --> 32:23.110]  That was my point.
[32:23.370 --> 32:25.670]  But you do have to you do have to wake up anyway that day.
[32:25.970 --> 32:28.330]  I do, but not at that time.
[32:28.330 --> 32:32.590]  I'm waking up earlier than I normally would to make this meeting.
[32:33.030 --> 32:39.070]  And by the time I see the alert, it's pointless because I like I can't in my sleep
[32:39.070 --> 32:43.690]  register that you've that you can't do it and that we have to move it.
[32:44.230 --> 32:45.490]  So an hour I could do.
[32:45.870 --> 32:48.890]  So now you've permanently moved it to 1130 our time.
[32:49.030 --> 32:50.970]  Yes, exactly. And I'm happy.
[32:51.130 --> 32:55.790]  And that way, if we change it like an hour before, you'll already be up.
[32:55.970 --> 32:59.590]  I will be up. I will have seen it will not have impacted the schedule
[32:59.590 --> 33:01.430]  in a way that it currently does.
[33:01.430 --> 33:02.850]  What if you oversleep?
[33:04.190 --> 33:06.070]  I have a great, great question, Jeff.
[33:06.170 --> 33:08.490]  Andrew, I have several alarms.
[33:08.790 --> 33:10.850]  I thought you can use the one time almost slept through.
[33:11.490 --> 33:16.570]  Do you think it's better to have a meeting earlier so it's not in the middle of the day for
[33:16.570 --> 33:18.210]  four fifths of us?
[33:19.430 --> 33:22.930]  So I am getting penalized for living on the West Coast.
[33:23.130 --> 33:24.190]  Yeah, so he should suffer.
[33:27.150 --> 33:28.290]  All I do.
[33:28.730 --> 33:30.190]  This is very American of you, Gavin.
[33:30.190 --> 33:31.590]  I'm adjusting for everything.
[33:31.830 --> 33:34.970]  I'm always to you guys. 10 a.m. show up 8 a.m. for me.
[33:35.790 --> 33:40.770]  Every time I'm going to I'm going to jump out and in defense of Andrew here and just say that
[33:40.770 --> 33:45.910]  I do think he's pretty accommodating, considering most of what we do is probably inconvenient for
[33:45.910 --> 33:52.550]  him. I'm actually on your side and I I often don't look at my calendar until Monday, which is my
[33:52.550 --> 33:57.590]  fault. I think what happened the time I did it, I had a doctor appointment at the time of our
[33:57.590 --> 34:02.310]  meeting that was probably booked like three months earlier. Yes. So I just was like, oh,
[34:02.470 --> 34:07.070]  shit, that's this week. And I was like, sorry, I have to move it. Yeah, totally. And that's fine.
[34:07.370 --> 34:11.870]  But it was just like I agreed to this meeting to try to be accommodating to y'all. And then the
[34:11.870 --> 34:16.150]  meeting kept getting moved. And it was like, why are we doing this? Let's move this meeting.
[34:16.890 --> 34:19.510]  Yeah, I don't you should have just said that in the beginning.
[34:19.830 --> 34:23.270]  That's all I was going to say. That's I was just waiting for you guys to finish. So I can say,
[34:23.330 --> 34:25.730]  why didn't you say any of this when we picked the first time?
[34:25.730 --> 34:30.550]  Yeah, if you have like, I don't care to do it on one day, you should have been like, I'm not up
[34:30.550 --> 34:34.390]  by that. Yeah, just go like, hey, honestly, can we do it at one your time? That would put me in a
[34:34.390 --> 34:40.470]  good position. That's I don't care. Yeah. At the time, I think I agreed to it because it seemed
[34:40.470 --> 34:46.390]  like that's when the meeting was wanted to have taken place. I said that horribly. But there was
[34:46.390 --> 34:53.030]  a sense there is a sense that that is when y'all wanted the meeting. And I was like, I'll do this
[34:53.030 --> 34:57.870]  for one week and see how it goes. And then if it's not ideal, then I'll move it. But then the
[34:57.870 --> 35:03.490]  meeting just kept getting moved. And then it became just an annoyance of this is ridiculous.
[35:03.930 --> 35:08.810]  Why is this here? Turns out it wasn't convenient for any of us. None of us wanted this time in
[35:08.810 --> 35:16.450]  reality. And I tried to vocalize this point. And I did horribly because I was up the entire night
[35:16.450 --> 35:22.710]  last time we had the meeting because I almost missed the last meeting. And I've been taking
[35:22.710 --> 35:29.290]  strays. I've been taking strays since that thing. And it is the most right I think I've ever been
[35:29.290 --> 35:34.510]  about anything. And I'm like, I can't. No, I will get shit on for so many things. I am in the right
[35:34.510 --> 35:40.150]  here. I know this isn't crazy. I'll give you that. But my thinking is, why would you decide at five
[35:40.150 --> 35:44.810]  that you're not going to go to sleep? Like surely even if you slept between seven and eight, sleep
[35:44.810 --> 35:50.690]  is sleep. Totally, absolutely valid. There is a time period. And I've crossed that line where I was
[35:50.690 --> 35:55.410]  younger, where I'd be like, I'd be worse to get sleep, like I'll be more tired. And now I'm no,
[35:55.470 --> 36:00.650]  if I get any sleep at all, that's a win. I just was incapable of it that night. I could not shut
[36:00.650 --> 36:07.250]  my brain off. I was fully awake. And I was really excited for this meeting. I was so pumped to hear
[36:07.250 --> 36:14.470]  what was going to happen at this meeting to set a schedule. And that that has been that. But now
[36:14.470 --> 36:22.270]  the meetings moved and we'll see how it goes. We have a clean meeting next week. Hey, speaking of
[36:22.270 --> 36:28.330]  meetings, this is kind of an aside, but Eric, you and I had a meeting with a mutual friend yesterday
[36:28.330 --> 36:31.770]  that I've been thinking about since our meeting. I want to see what you guys think about this.
[36:32.230 --> 36:36.850]  I don't want to out the friend because I'm not sure if they'd be comfortable with the world
[36:36.850 --> 36:41.090]  knowing that they're friends with Eric and I. Okay. I can get how that would be a detractor.
[36:41.090 --> 36:46.870]  But we were hanging out with this friend who has a cool project that they work on,
[36:46.930 --> 36:51.210]  it's like their job. And we were talking about scheduling another meetup. And we were like,
[36:51.250 --> 36:57.130]  well, what about... In the process, we were like, well, how are you handling your workload with the
[36:57.130 --> 37:01.210]  stuff that you're doing? And they said, well, I do it all on Mondays. I just get the whole thing done
[37:01.210 --> 37:05.290]  on Monday. That boss may have some Mondays and basically just get all of my work done on that day.
[37:05.530 --> 37:09.450]  And I was like, oh, that's pretty smart if you can do it. And they only have one project they're
[37:09.450 --> 37:12.290]  really working on right now. So I was like, yeah, that makes sense. And then we were trying to
[37:12.290 --> 37:15.730]  figure out when to get together again. And Eric said, well, what about next Friday? And they said,
[37:15.770 --> 37:20.250]  I tend to try. I don't want to schedule stuff on Fridays because I want to start my weekend early.
[37:20.410 --> 37:24.470]  And we were like, oh, okay, I guess that makes sense. But then I was thinking about it in bed
[37:24.470 --> 37:29.390]  last night and I was like, doesn't your weekend start on Tuesday? You only work one day a week.
[37:29.490 --> 37:35.390]  Yeah. If you've slotted everything to be one day. I think you're oversimplifying what they were
[37:35.390 --> 37:42.430]  saying. But I will say I agree with you. What the fuck are they thinking, baby? I think at the end
[37:42.430 --> 37:48.930]  of this story, I know who that is now. I can't start my weekend early. You do. You work one day
[37:48.930 --> 37:56.790]  a week. It is an insane thing to say in the context. And I'm sure the way that I felt
[37:56.790 --> 38:02.770]  taking unnecessary strays for what I said, if this person is probably irate, if they hear this
[38:02.770 --> 38:09.470]  being like this is completely mischaracterized. But based on what you said, yeah, that's ridiculous.
[38:09.750 --> 38:14.210]  That is insane. Eric's right. I'm sure I'm oversimplifying it a little bit, but the nuts
[38:14.210 --> 38:18.690]  and bolts of it are essentially correct. What I've said. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So anyway,
[38:19.030 --> 38:24.390]  so when do we want to get together again? I can't do Monday. Okay, how about Friday? Nah,
[38:24.410 --> 38:32.410]  I can't do Friday. All right, cool. So what do you want? Just say I don't want to get together
[38:32.410 --> 38:38.790]  again. Is it a friendly hangout or is it work related meeting? No, it's friendly. It's kind of
[38:38.790 --> 38:44.550]  like like what we do with Nick and Jason. Right. But that wouldn't that wouldn't mean that wouldn't
[38:44.550 --> 38:49.370]  overtake the weekend. Even if your weekend had started, it's a friendly hangout, then that's
[38:49.370 --> 38:53.790]  still the weekend. I think we agree. I think we agree with you, Gavin. I think we're a bunch. I
[38:53.790 --> 38:58.330]  think we're five guys in a Discord call agreeing with each other. I think it sounds like three
[38:58.330 --> 39:04.330]  people where two of them are hanging out and one of them's at work. Okay, now that sounds like an
[39:04.330 --> 39:19.860]  accurate assessment of exactly what this relationship is to a T. You have no idea how right you are.
[39:20.260 --> 39:27.300]  Man, you just hit the nail on the fucking head. That might be the perfect distillation of that
[39:28.920 --> 39:34.900]  Jesus Christ, man. Oh, I would hate that. Even if we could do that, I would hate that because
[39:34.900 --> 39:40.020]  that means that we're only spending one day a week doing like I don't know. Oh, my God. It's
[39:40.020 --> 39:44.600]  yeah. You guys are the only people on earth I want to spend time with. And I just want to be around
[39:44.600 --> 39:47.480]  you all the time, with the exception of my wife and dog and daughter. But you know what I mean?
[39:47.560 --> 39:51.680]  I just want to. Yeah, absolutely. I get annoyed if it's like nine o'clock at night and I'm like,
[39:51.740 --> 39:54.000]  oh, I wonder if I should text the guys and see if they want to film something.
[39:54.440 --> 39:58.040]  Don't do that. You can't do that. You can't do that just because you're awake and ready to
[39:58.040 --> 40:02.140]  film doesn't mean they are. You just had your first week away, as we mentioned earlier. And
[40:02.140 --> 40:08.600]  I was so excited to text you. Yeah, about it, because when I missed one day of gameplay
[40:08.600 --> 40:13.320]  recordings, I saw you guys in the Discord thing. I was like, oh, man, my friends are having fun.
[40:13.700 --> 40:19.160]  I wish I was like it was such a like I was the sick kid and I was looking out my window and I
[40:19.160 --> 40:23.360]  was seeing all the neighborhood kids play soccer or whatever and just be like, oh, I could have
[40:23.360 --> 40:30.780]  been part of that. I'm not I'm missing that. That sucks. Very secret garden. Yes, I. Yeah,
[40:30.800 --> 40:35.180]  it was brutal, especially because y'all I didn't know ahead of time you were going to do this,
[40:35.760 --> 40:41.320]  but you guys decided to play GTA heists, not like player created heists like we used to do back in
[40:41.320 --> 40:45.480]  the day with Achievement Hunter, but the Rockstar created heists, which Achievement Hunter also did.
[40:45.560 --> 40:51.380]  The irony there for me is that when Achievement Hunter went through and did all of those heists,
[40:51.380 --> 40:54.840]  I think there's like four of them or maybe five of them and they're like multi-part,
[40:55.000 --> 40:59.860]  you know, they take a while. Yeah, I was out of town or something when they started it. And so
[40:59.860 --> 41:05.820]  I missed the boat. They already had their team set and they were going. And so I just never played
[41:05.820 --> 41:10.900]  or got to participate in any of that. I think I may have gotten to participate in one of the videos,
[41:10.940 --> 41:15.620]  like half of one of the videos. I just assumed that you had done all of them. No, that is why
[41:15.620 --> 41:21.000]  I've never touched them. And so y'all starting it last week when I went out of town was such a
[41:21.000 --> 41:27.040]  wonderful, nostalgic moment where I just thought, oh, I want to I just want to drown myself in a
[41:27.040 --> 41:31.140]  bathtub. I'm never going to play these fucking games. Thank you so much. I'm so glad history
[41:31.140 --> 41:38.360]  does, in fact, repeat itself. I'm going to go kill myself now. I got more fake, not real beef,
[41:38.380 --> 41:44.560]  but annoyed with Gavin beef from that experience. From doing the heists? Yeah. I've never beaten
[41:44.560 --> 41:51.420]  the Humane Labs raid heist. And I was so excited that now we're going to finally beat this heist
[41:51.420 --> 41:55.960]  that I've never finished. I've gotten to the last part of it every time. And then for whatever
[41:55.960 --> 42:02.580]  reason, the group I'm part of decides to just not follow through with it. And I was all excited to
[42:02.580 --> 42:06.560]  continue going. Gavin doesn't want to film the heist for a little bit. He wants to take a break
[42:06.560 --> 42:11.040]  from filming any more heist stuff. And I went, you son of a bitch, you motherfucker. I'm the
[42:11.040 --> 42:15.660]  We can do it. We're just three videos ahead and no one's even started editing the first one.
[42:15.880 --> 42:22.700]  We're going to be... I'd love to just get in the game. I absolutely agree with you, Gavin. You're
[42:22.700 --> 42:29.680]  100% right. I don't care. And I want to play Grand Theft Auto. What if you guys just deleted
[42:29.680 --> 42:34.680]  those three videos and never played it again? Why don't we just finish it and then we have it
[42:34.680 --> 42:37.820]  and then it'll come out eventually. Here's what we should do. Here's what we should do.
[42:37.820 --> 42:42.400]  Mm hmm. I've already done all these. I should swap out with Jeff and watch.
[42:42.520 --> 42:46.360]  We can't do that halfway through the heist. You guys have a crew set. You can't do that.
[42:46.540 --> 42:50.780]  It's a terrible idea. We can't switch out. We're halfway through a heist right now.
[42:50.780 --> 42:55.400]  I just have to miss out on this one. And, you know, when we start a new company in 10 years,
[42:55.480 --> 42:59.480]  I'll miss out on those two. Okay, what if we wrap up this heist, which is the second one,
[42:59.800 --> 43:03.240]  or the third one, I guess, because we skipped the first one, and then Jeff comes in for the rest?
[43:04.360 --> 43:07.100]  That's, I mean, that's not up to you. Who am I replacing? Who am I replacing?
[43:07.100 --> 43:11.320]  No, you guys have a thing set. No, no, no. Here's the thing. The problem with that
[43:11.320 --> 43:16.060]  is you need to be here, Gavin, because you have become the absolute worst influence on Nick.
[43:16.320 --> 43:22.620]  And it is so fascinating how to see Nick unravel. I've learned that there are new and improved
[43:22.620 --> 43:29.660]  ways to fail those heists that I didn't think were even possible. And it has bled into other
[43:29.660 --> 43:36.280]  facets of our work. You have turned Nick into a chaotic, unpredictable mess.
[43:38.040 --> 43:43.360]  It started in GTA. It bled into what we did our last Twitch stream. Eric was like,
[43:43.460 --> 43:48.660]  I want to tell Gavin this story about speed. And then Nick was like, well, let me sync us up for
[43:48.660 --> 43:52.960]  the stream. And then it was like, okay, we'll do that. And then as soon as we sync, Nick just went,
[43:53.060 --> 43:59.760]  okay, we're live. And we were like three minutes early. And so then Eric just had to talk about
[43:59.760 --> 44:05.180]  speed for three minutes. Nick is unpredictable right now in a way that is so uncharacteristic
[44:05.180 --> 44:09.180]  of how I've known Nick for the past four years. And it's great.
[44:09.600 --> 44:13.160]  You know what, Andrew? I'm glad you brought this up. And I feel like maybe it's time to
[44:13.160 --> 44:19.220]  finally talk about something that I have been keeping secret for a long time. This is what we
[44:19.220 --> 44:26.720]  call the Gavin effect. And the most clear example of it, I think I can give to you all as not a part
[44:26.720 --> 44:31.720]  of this podcast, but certainly podcast adjacent, I guess, in some roles. You guys remember Michael
[44:31.720 --> 44:36.300]  Jones used to work at Achievement Hunter with us. He does the food podcast. Completely different
[44:36.300 --> 44:44.400]  human being before I introduced him to Gavin. He's like calm, respectful, quiet. Did like to
[44:44.400 --> 44:50.780]  do crossword puzzles a lot. Kind of like a deep thinker, mousy, nerdy guy. And then I introduced
[44:50.780 --> 44:54.360]  him to Gavin and like three weeks later, he turned into Jersey trash. And I don't know where it came
[44:54.360 --> 45:00.020]  from, but it's this thing that Gavin has on some people. And what I'm saying is Nick is going to
[45:00.020 --> 45:08.580]  get worse. I think I believe that. I believe the next going to get worse part, but I'm excited to
[45:08.580 --> 45:17.060]  see it. Even if I sit out and Jeff fills my slot, I can still be in the recording and I can still
[45:17.060 --> 45:23.640]  watch Nick's feed and I can still have the same effect. I don't know. I don't like it. You're like
[45:23.640 --> 45:30.680]  a siren. Yeah, that's what I was calling. He just siren. He just steers the fucking ship towards the rocks
[45:30.680 --> 45:36.520]  because you whisper in his fucking ear like it's the worst. I don't want to spoil a video, but
[45:36.520 --> 45:46.220]  we were in the midst of something and Gavin made an insane declaration and we were so like things
[45:46.220 --> 45:52.520]  were so OK that I wasn't even looking at my screen anymore. I was opening. I was in a food app getting
[45:52.520 --> 45:59.560]  ready to order myself lunch because we were we're good to go. And Gavin yelled something and I went,
[45:59.720 --> 46:06.300]  do I have to look up and shut down what's happening? No, it's fine. We're all good. And then we were
[46:06.300 --> 46:14.480]  not all good. We were very much not all good. And that has just been insane. Nick has been a crazy
[46:14.480 --> 46:22.060]  person in a great way. Completely unpredictable. The Nick flowering, as it were. Yeah.
[46:23.520 --> 46:29.040]  Oh, man. He just keeps saying I'm helping. It's the worst.
[46:30.920 --> 46:38.280]  Hey, it's Paris. You know, I love sparkly things, right? Like stars. Duh. And thanks to Hilton and

[47:31.100 --> 47:34.680]  Speaking of video games, y'all know how I've been soda streaming for a while?
[47:34.820 --> 47:35.860]  Oh, of course.
[47:35.860 --> 47:38.440]  How much I fucking love soda streaming. I got really into streaming.
[47:38.980 --> 47:41.180]  Yesterday, I started doing the other one, Twitch streaming.
[47:41.800 --> 47:42.240]  How did that go?
[47:42.340 --> 47:42.980]  Oh, yeah.
[47:43.160 --> 47:50.300]  Good. Good. Eric came over and he helped me set up my Twitch account. Fake Jeff is my name. I think
[47:50.300 --> 47:54.320]  I must have made when we were doing like GTA and Achievement Hunter or something. Back when we had
[47:54.320 --> 48:00.760]  the fake age crew. And I did my first ever stream. I streamed for an hour yesterday to two people.
[48:01.480 --> 48:05.520]  Why don't you just stream on our podcast account? Why are you using your own mini account?
[48:05.860 --> 48:10.200]  Just to have it built up so that if we ever have to do like multiple streams or like if we like,
[48:10.280 --> 48:13.520]  you know, Gavin and I did that stream with some of the old Achievement Hunter guys and I wasn't
[48:13.520 --> 48:17.800]  able to stream it. I just played and I'd like to have a presence that that's not necessarily
[48:17.800 --> 48:20.380]  our main account. You know, I just figured it'd be helpful flexibility.
[48:21.060 --> 48:25.140]  He's a contingency for when this falls apart. At least he has his Twitch channel.
[48:25.380 --> 48:29.660]  Yeah, there's that. There's that, too. And I know Gus is Eric Gus. Gavin's been working on his
[48:30.560 --> 48:33.780]  getting his Twitch streaming stuff up in the background, too. I just figured we might as
[48:33.780 --> 48:37.900]  well all have it. It feels weird to be like the one who doesn't have it.
[48:38.240 --> 48:41.680]  I'm going to burn mine down, though. I'm not. You're having trouble here, so.
[48:43.960 --> 48:49.120]  What's the problem? I got too many camera feeds. I'm trying to do it from a pinball machine,
[48:49.120 --> 48:54.960]  which isn't smart to begin with. I need like three cameras. And for some reason, every Elgato
[48:55.720 --> 49:01.300]  piece of hardware I have works 50 percent of the time. I want to smash all of it into tiny
[49:01.300 --> 49:05.560]  little pieces. Is there a better solution than Elgato you could use? Yeah. Black. Yeah. Black
[49:05.560 --> 49:12.980]  magic. Black magic. Yeah. Yeah. Like actual professional shit. Yeah. It's just like
[49:13.640 --> 49:17.560]  much more expensive. Yeah. Real shit for actual people. Yeah. That kind of thing. You got to spend
[49:17.560 --> 49:22.080]  money to make real shit for actual people. It's such a funny tagline for a company.
[49:23.960 --> 49:29.180]  But like, I just can't. There's nothing worse than when you're trying to do
[49:29.580 --> 49:34.040]  the fun thing and you're like, I'm excited about this new project that I'm going to do and I have
[49:34.040 --> 49:38.300]  all the things that I need. And you start doing it and you go, none of this works. And I'm in a
[49:38.300 --> 49:45.080]  hell of my own. I just can't figure out. And OBS is a frickin piece of shit. Probably not. And I
[49:45.080 --> 49:49.260]  just don't know how to use it. But why is it that if I lose a feed of one of my cameras and it just
[49:49.260 --> 49:55.560]  starts shitting out green, do I have to go into the properties, pick what it is, select something
[49:55.560 --> 50:00.360]  different and then select the thing again? Why isn't there just like a refresh device button?
[50:00.880 --> 50:03.740]  I think there's a deactivate and inactivate.
[50:04.480 --> 50:05.400]  Okay. What is that?
[50:06.940 --> 50:09.500]  I'm just saying. Are you talking about like the little eyeball?
[50:10.380 --> 50:14.020]  Well, there's that, but I think you can double click on it and there's an activate deactivate
[50:14.020 --> 50:17.340]  thing in the middle there that like turns it off as a source and then turns it back on.
[50:17.740 --> 50:19.020]  Okay. I'm slightly less annoyed.
[50:19.540 --> 50:22.920]  Well, I mean, but that might not even be the right thing. Because it's Elgato,
[50:23.020 --> 50:25.280]  you might really have to switch off from it and come back.
[50:25.560 --> 50:28.820]  Is you trying to do the pinball thing related to what I talked to you about?
[50:29.280 --> 50:31.280]  No. Oh, just completely unrelated?
[50:31.300 --> 50:32.320]  That's a different pinball thing.
[50:32.860 --> 50:37.340]  That's a different pinball. I thought I thought you were. I'm trying to get Gavin to challenge
[50:37.340 --> 50:42.300]  me in a pinball score off. And I thought that you were going to use your physical cabinet while I
[50:42.300 --> 50:46.760]  did the virtual one was what you were doing. That's a hilarious. I mean, if you can get the
[50:46.760 --> 50:51.920]  virtual version of my physical one. I have a virtual version of one of your physical ones.
[50:52.360 --> 50:53.740]  I've been playing it a decent amount.
[50:53.740 --> 50:55.640]  That's an interesting challenge.
[50:56.040 --> 51:00.460]  Wait, you have you have a virtual version of a real pinball machine that Gavin has?
[51:00.640 --> 51:02.300]  Yes. Wow.
[51:02.420 --> 51:05.720]  The champion's ball or whatever. What's the bar one?
[51:06.040 --> 51:06.660]  Champion pub.
[51:07.080 --> 51:08.540]  Champion pub. Yeah, it's a great.
[51:08.740 --> 51:09.880]  That's not the one I've plugged in.
[51:10.560 --> 51:14.340]  Okay, well, I'm just saying I have one of the four.
[51:14.960 --> 51:18.620]  Ken, is this something you Gavin, are you interested in participating in this?
[51:19.200 --> 51:19.440]  Yeah.
[51:20.180 --> 51:21.100]  He's a pinball guy.
[51:21.100 --> 51:24.360]  You have champion pub, the one where you have to shoot the ball at the guy
[51:24.360 --> 51:26.840]  and like the little punching bag and the jump rope and stuff.
[51:27.140 --> 51:30.940]  You have the punch bag and then it spins around and you could hit him in the face.
[51:31.540 --> 51:34.640]  That's like the coolest. That's like the coolest pinball machine.
[51:34.840 --> 51:36.340]  You have like the coolest pinball machine.
[51:36.760 --> 51:40.660]  Yeah, if you enjoy the pinball slamming into the glass and scaring the shit out of you,
[51:40.800 --> 51:42.120]  then that's the one to get.
[51:43.480 --> 51:45.920]  Gavin, do you think he could beat you or do you think you could beat him?
[51:46.340 --> 51:47.260]  How confident are you?
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.800]  I'm not much of a pinball guy. I think Gavin has the edge when we start.
[51:50.800 --> 51:54.140]  Gavin's a big pinball guy, real quiet about it, but real big into it.
[51:54.500 --> 51:57.000]  Yeah, it's like a little secret background hobby. I'm into it.
[51:57.040 --> 51:58.100]  Not so secret now.
[51:58.560 --> 51:58.800]  No.
[51:58.920 --> 52:00.540]  Not as an episode 10 of this podcast.
[52:02.760 --> 52:04.980]  Oh man, I kind of want to put money on this.
[52:05.760 --> 52:08.980]  I wanted it to be like the Halo 2 race we did where I was streaming,
[52:09.140 --> 52:13.840]  like we'd go back and forth and I would stream this virtual pinball game I've been playing.
[52:14.240 --> 52:17.060]  I would probably just have to play the virtual one though to keep it fair.
[52:17.900 --> 52:18.780]  I mean, whatever works.
[52:19.220 --> 52:22.840]  There's a whole other kind of element to this that's like,
[52:22.900 --> 52:27.120]  is there a difference between the virtual and the analog version?
[52:28.120 --> 52:31.260]  Well, I mean, the ability to slam it around and tilt and,
[52:31.960 --> 52:35.200]  you know, nudge the ball around is probably easier on a real one.
[52:36.020 --> 52:37.040]  Yeah, there's a tilt button.
[52:37.200 --> 52:39.580]  You have that button on the virtual one though, I guarantee you.
[52:39.740 --> 52:40.780]  Does it have like directional...
[52:41.400 --> 52:42.640]  Yeah, left or right tilt?
[52:43.320 --> 52:43.460]  Yeah.
[52:43.920 --> 52:44.500]  Up and down?
[52:45.200 --> 52:46.600]  Not up and down, but left and right.
[52:46.600 --> 52:50.560]  But if it doesn't, I mean, that would give you the advantage on the real one.
[52:50.760 --> 52:55.220]  But for some reason to me, I feel like the virtual version would be easier to get a high score on.
[52:55.340 --> 52:58.140]  What's cool about the virtual version is you can toggle between
[52:58.140 --> 53:02.340]  what the actual table board is like and what the like video game version of it is.
[53:02.440 --> 53:07.800]  So like if you do the actual version, it's just like that guy standing there taking hits,
[53:07.800 --> 53:11.540]  but like the video game one, he's swinging his fists when he's hitting and
[53:11.540 --> 53:13.600]  like there's just some additional graphics to it.
[53:13.820 --> 53:15.140]  He swings his fists in the real one.
[53:15.140 --> 53:19.060]  Oh, does he? Okay, well, it's just like I think the range of motion is more...
[53:19.780 --> 53:23.200]  there's like a video game-ized version of the board and then
[53:23.200 --> 53:25.820]  what the real board kind of works as.
[53:28.440 --> 53:29.780]  I'm really excited about it.
[53:30.340 --> 53:32.980]  I've been playing a lot of Snoopy pinballs while I still met Eric.
[53:33.980 --> 53:35.440]  I'm all into pinball right now.
[53:35.660 --> 53:36.460]  Virtual pinball.
[53:36.980 --> 53:40.960]  Haven't been in a long time into it, but having a blast.
[53:41.240 --> 53:42.580]  Did you ever play Sonic Spinball?
[53:43.840 --> 53:44.840]  No, I don't think so.
[53:44.840 --> 53:46.560]  I played the Pokemon pinball.
[53:46.660 --> 53:47.520]  God, I hate that game.
[53:47.680 --> 53:49.060]  Sonic Spinball sucks.
[53:49.440 --> 53:49.820]  Yeah, it was...
[53:50.480 --> 53:51.860]  Are you not a pinball guy, Eric?
[53:53.000 --> 53:56.120]  No, if it's free play, I like pinball, but I've had to pay for it.
[53:56.140 --> 53:56.460]  I hate it.
[53:56.540 --> 53:58.340]  Also, I owned Sonic Spinball when I was a kid.
[53:58.460 --> 53:58.880]  I fuck it.
[53:58.960 --> 53:59.600]  Oh, miserable.
[54:01.540 --> 54:04.500]  I've been playing another Jeff favorite.
[54:05.800 --> 54:07.220]  I got my toes.
[54:07.300 --> 54:10.260]  I dipped my toes in the Call of the Wild Angler.
[54:10.760 --> 54:12.220]  Oh, you've been fishing?
[54:13.120 --> 54:14.140]  A little bit.
[54:14.140 --> 54:15.820]  I fished one night.
[54:15.960 --> 54:18.580]  To say I've been fishing is maybe a little bit of a stretch.
[54:19.200 --> 54:19.920]  And I had fun.
[54:20.460 --> 54:21.120]  It's a fun game.
[54:21.320 --> 54:23.980]  It does the annoying thing where you have to make an account when you load in.
[54:24.160 --> 54:24.540]  Hate that.
[54:24.540 --> 54:26.180]  I hate that shit so much.
[54:26.480 --> 54:27.360]  Yeah, it's so useless.
[54:27.860 --> 54:31.860]  I had such an unexpected laugh from it where you have to catch your first fish.
[54:31.980 --> 54:34.300]  And they like every time you catch fish, you celebrate.
[54:34.740 --> 54:38.500]  And I got, I caught, I got the tiniest piece of shit fish.
[54:38.820 --> 54:40.060]  Just a little baby fish.
[54:40.180 --> 54:41.260]  And I was just like, look at my fish.
[54:41.700 --> 54:43.260]  Look how happy I am with my fish.
[54:43.260 --> 54:46.880]  Got this tiny little fish showing it off.
[54:47.060 --> 54:48.500]  It's like an inch long.
[54:48.920 --> 54:52.040]  There's nothing impressive about this fish.
[54:52.140 --> 54:53.120]  We're just like, hey, look at this.
[54:53.420 --> 54:54.140]  Look what I did.
[54:54.880 --> 54:56.080]  Hey man, humble beginnings.
[54:56.460 --> 54:58.620]  You keep at it and you'll catch a goldfish someday.
[54:58.960 --> 55:01.340]  And not a goldfish, but a gold level fish.
[55:01.520 --> 55:02.460]  And it'll be huge.
[55:02.980 --> 55:03.460]  I like it.
[55:03.600 --> 55:06.860]  The fish is so small, his thumb is like smothering it.
[55:07.140 --> 55:08.760]  Yeah, his thumb is larger.
[55:09.220 --> 55:10.420]  Is that what your beard looks like?
[55:10.840 --> 55:14.260]  Uh, it's, it's like, yeah, it's kind of close to it.
[55:14.960 --> 55:16.260]  I think that's a good comparable.
[55:16.620 --> 55:19.000]  0.04 kilograms.
[55:20.180 --> 55:21.760]  I have no idea how much that weighs.
[55:21.900 --> 55:22.480]  It was small.
[55:22.920 --> 55:25.660]  Could someone with Photoshop put that beard on the picture of Andrew?
[55:28.920 --> 55:30.740]  I'll, uh, I'll see.
[55:30.800 --> 55:34.000]  I'll give a thumbs up if it's close or not to the current beard situation.
[55:34.280 --> 55:35.120]  If that gets done.
[55:35.400 --> 55:40.080]  But I caught my fish and then I walked into the water by accident and it crashed the game.
[55:40.080 --> 55:42.180]  And that was my time to follow the wild angler.
[55:42.640 --> 55:44.420]  But I'm excited to get back into it.
[55:45.420 --> 55:46.640]  Yeah, it's a real peaceful game.
[55:47.000 --> 55:48.160]  It's also fun driving.
[55:48.320 --> 55:50.360]  You just get in an SUV and just drive around.
[55:50.660 --> 55:53.040]  It's pretty forgiving with the driving physics.
[55:53.700 --> 55:53.720]  Yeah.
[55:53.860 --> 55:54.840]  What the hell is a blood worm?
[55:55.000 --> 55:55.680]  Is that a real thing?
[55:56.400 --> 55:56.600]  Yeah.
[55:57.040 --> 55:58.920]  It's like blood sausage, but it's a worm.
[55:59.380 --> 55:59.820]  Yeah.
[56:00.400 --> 56:02.680]  Which is really all a sausage is, right?
[56:02.920 --> 56:03.340]  A big worm.
[56:04.460 --> 56:04.900]  Exactly.
[56:06.120 --> 56:07.680]  I realize my weird fear.
[56:08.400 --> 56:09.220]  I'm happy.
[56:09.220 --> 56:10.440]  For the fear diagram.
[56:11.260 --> 56:12.620]  Yeah, I got one.
[56:12.920 --> 56:16.860]  I didn't consider this a fear, but I was like, it kind of aligns with Gavin's wet bread.
[56:18.760 --> 56:20.740]  I hate paper.
[56:21.340 --> 56:22.300]  Paper cups.
[56:23.300 --> 56:24.860]  Not a fan of paper cup.
[56:25.000 --> 56:25.880]  These things.
[56:27.340 --> 56:28.920]  I'll send a photo right now.
[56:29.160 --> 56:30.560]  You know, those triangle paper.
[56:32.640 --> 56:34.700]  You know, those triangle paper cups.
[56:35.260 --> 56:42.020]  The thought of the texture on my lips gives me goosebumps.
[56:42.480 --> 56:43.660]  It gives you chills, right?
[56:43.980 --> 56:46.620]  It chills me all over.
[56:46.960 --> 56:47.780]  Yep, I have that too.
[56:47.780 --> 56:49.260]  It makes me so uncomfortable.
[56:50.060 --> 56:53.960]  Scratching of cardboard, same thing, but it's largely like paper texture.
[56:54.360 --> 56:55.980]  Don't like it at all.
[56:58.020 --> 57:00.100]  Fear I don't have.
[57:00.260 --> 57:01.260]  A wet hand.
[57:01.340 --> 57:04.180]  A wet hand touching paper.
[57:04.700 --> 57:05.760]  Is like that.
[57:06.120 --> 57:07.280]  Then I look.
[57:09.680 --> 57:10.160]  This.
[57:10.600 --> 57:12.900]  The thought of like biting on paper.
[57:13.200 --> 57:14.500]  Oh no, I hate that Eric.
[57:15.020 --> 57:19.400]  Yeah, it makes it makes me feel so bad on the inside.
[57:19.840 --> 57:21.400]  It like physically pains me.
[57:21.600 --> 57:26.740]  Yeah, so that sounds similar to someone I know who has, they can't touch like a wooden spoon.
[57:26.980 --> 57:29.700]  It's like too grippy if they drag their finger on it.
[57:29.760 --> 57:30.360]  Do you have that?
[57:30.860 --> 57:31.120]  What?
[57:31.120 --> 57:35.240]  It's like the way like, you know, like wood that's kind of grippy.
[57:35.360 --> 57:38.340]  If you like, yeah, like pull your finger across a wooden spoon.
[57:38.420 --> 57:39.700]  It like grips and releases.
[57:40.580 --> 57:42.840]  Yeah, I'm fine with that.
[57:43.100 --> 57:44.840]  I don't like popsicle sticks, though.
[57:45.960 --> 57:46.980]  I'm not a fan of those.
[57:48.280 --> 57:49.160]  See, that's similar.
[57:49.200 --> 57:50.360]  Paper is way worse.
[57:51.080 --> 57:52.300]  Way worse with paper.
[57:52.560 --> 57:53.760]  I'm like a golf ball.
[57:53.920 --> 57:55.120]  Like I have dimples right now.
[57:55.160 --> 57:57.360]  Like I'm just all goosebumps all over.
[57:59.240 --> 58:00.340]  Not a fan.
[58:00.340 --> 58:01.440]  So that is my fear.
[58:01.560 --> 58:06.540]  But I'm not like, I didn't consider that because it's not like I'm avoiding paper cups.
[58:06.760 --> 58:10.260]  It just triggers something in me that is unexplainable.
[58:10.340 --> 58:11.460]  It makes me feel very uncomfortable.
[58:12.260 --> 58:15.700]  Which I think falls in the spirit of our fear diagram.
[58:16.340 --> 58:22.040]  If we have a fear diagram, Andrew, and we overlap, our overlap is just this.
[58:22.400 --> 58:23.560]  This is paper, yeah.
[58:24.160 --> 58:26.320]  Doesn't have anything to do with getting my blood pressure taken.
[58:26.460 --> 58:28.220]  This is such a, I hate this feeling.
[58:28.260 --> 58:29.880]  Your fear diagram is a straight line.
[58:32.820 --> 58:36.140]  When did people decide that was an acceptable cup as well?
[58:36.520 --> 58:38.600]  Like what was wrong with just stacking normal cups?
[58:39.680 --> 58:41.420]  Geoff, do you think it was like the 50s?
[58:41.580 --> 58:44.140]  I think it's people who are working on cars in the 50s.
[58:44.300 --> 58:46.120]  Yeah, it was like they used to be waxy too.
[58:46.240 --> 58:48.240]  Sometimes you can get them waxy and they last a little bit longer.
[58:48.420 --> 58:49.940]  But they're like single use.
[58:50.180 --> 58:51.240]  They're dog shit.
[58:51.340 --> 58:53.100]  They always crease in the middle.
[58:53.540 --> 58:55.040]  I haven't seen them in a while.
[58:55.240 --> 58:59.700]  Usually if you do see them, it's only at like a mechanic shop.
[59:00.340 --> 59:01.340]  Or a car wash.
[59:02.480 --> 59:04.640]  Yeah, it's like let's invent a cup that you can't put down.
[59:05.820 --> 59:07.280]  Yeah, you definitely can't put it down anywhere.
[59:08.140 --> 59:12.000]  I remember making this realization when I was in a bank as a child.
[59:12.240 --> 59:14.600]  That was where they had, they had like the little water thing.
[59:15.460 --> 59:18.080]  And those, it was an attachment to the machine.
[59:18.400 --> 59:20.260]  And just trying to drink water out of that cup.
[59:20.340 --> 59:21.760]  Just being like, this is fucking weird.
[59:22.020 --> 59:22.740]  I don't like this.
[59:23.780 --> 59:24.040]  Ew.
[59:24.740 --> 59:26.480]  When are we doing our throat goat?
[59:28.820 --> 59:32.220]  We need to, I forgot that that was a thing.
[59:32.560 --> 59:35.400]  We've all got to spit our mouth full into a Pyrex.
[59:35.560 --> 59:39.420]  And then we're going to put those lines, the amounts on a Gerpler.
[59:39.740 --> 59:40.080]  The throat goat.
[59:40.120 --> 59:44.360]  I am so excited to get that phone you sent me, Gavin.
[59:44.400 --> 59:45.660]  So I can send you a scan of my head.
[59:46.060 --> 59:47.140]  I want that so badly.
[59:47.720 --> 59:48.840]  Yeah, have you not got the phone yet?
[59:49.240 --> 59:50.960]  Not yet, no, still waiting on the package.
[59:51.160 --> 59:52.660]  Yeah, it was supposed to arrive last Wednesday.
[59:53.020 --> 59:55.620]  I think we're still waiting on Andrew to get a puzzle too, right?
[59:55.660 --> 59:56.460]  I'm also waiting on the puzzle.
[59:56.460 --> 01:00:00.520]  Like, I thought it was delivered, but it was the wrong order that
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.320]  everyone else has got delivered, yours hasn't yet.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:08.320]  I think the person Andrew is using on Vancouver Island to forward his stuff
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:12.020]  to where he actually lives and won't tell us, I think that person's dropping the ball.
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:15.340]  Well, I think that they moved into an old age home.
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:19.180]  Do you think Andrew even lives in Canada?
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.380]  What if he lives in like, Pflugerville?
[01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:24.580]  Crazy.
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:27.060]  I bet that's the hold up.
[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:31.120]  It takes a long time to ship a package to Canada and then back to where it came from.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:35.340]  Yeah, this country is iffy on like, re-importing.
[01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:42.210]  Oh man, you would be so mad if I was doing that.
[01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:46.070]  If I was making you all ship something to Canada for the annoyance of it.
[01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:48.190]  And pretending that you were on Pacific time the whole time?
[01:00:49.050 --> 01:00:51.230]  I'm actually on the East Coast, I'm an hour ahead.
[01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:53.470]  You just want to wake up at noon.
[01:00:56.690 --> 01:01:02.230]  I have an idea on how to grow our podcast organically.
[01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:04.690]  I wanted to pitch you guys real fast before we end.
[01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:06.310]  If you guys are okay with it.
[01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:10.410]  Of course, I hate that my brain imagined the podcast as a seed in a pot.
[01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.290]  Okay.
[01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:12.590]  I posted a photo.
[01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:16.910]  Jeff just posted a photo of Michael J. Fox, an autographed image.
[01:01:17.850 --> 01:01:19.730]  And it says, try the shakes.
[01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:22.230]  It's hanging in a restaurant somewhere.
[01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:26.110]  I recently was in Toledo, Ohio.
[01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:30.470]  And I ate at a place called fucking Tony Paco's, I think.
[01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:32.510]  It was like a hot dog restaurant, like a Polish hot dog restaurant.
[01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:33.910]  Or Hungarian, I think.
[01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:39.590]  But they were, they're on the map because they are, they have,
[01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:46.790]  they maintain the world's largest collection of celebrity autographed hot dog buns.
[01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:50.390]  Speaking of which, by the way, guess who I saw there?
[01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:51.470]  Fucking Kevin Costner.
[01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:52.070]  I took a picture.
[01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:53.210]  I'll load it up right now.
[01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:54.490]  Oh, Horizon.
[01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:55.910]  Go get your tickets.
[01:01:56.090 --> 01:01:56.930]  There are plenty available.
[01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:00.850]  You know what?
[01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:01.190]  There are.
[01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:02.490]  There are plenty available for you.
[01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:03.150]  There's so many.
[01:02:03.310 --> 01:02:03.930]  Whatever time you want to go.
[01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:08.630]  Anyway, and I was, while I was there, I was just looking around.
[01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:13.670]  You know, I did the, I got up three different times to look at the hot dog buns and go like,
[01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:14.650]  oh, look, there's a celebrity.
[01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:15.050]  There's a celebrity.
[01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:15.530]  Oh, that's cool.
[01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:18.830]  And then I realized I, everybody around me was doing it.
[01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:22.530]  Everybody is going there and looking at the hot dog buns and looking at the celebrities.
[01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:22.850]  Right.
[01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:28.430]  So that got me thinking, what if we had a photo made like a black and white, like 90s comedy,
[01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:32.250]  like store photo of the five of us together.
[01:02:32.530 --> 01:02:36.670]  And then we could give them out to every restaurant in America.
[01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:39.990]  We could just start mailing them to restaurants with like nice phrases on it.
[01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:43.190]  Like try the shakes or like can't beat their burger.
[01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:43.850]  Right.
[01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:45.770]  And they could be available upon request.
[01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:49.170]  We could even give them to audience members if they wanted to then take them and
[01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:50.810]  deliver them to restaurants.
[01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:52.330]  And we could see two things.
[01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:55.710]  One, we could see if we could grow organically by being in, by the way,
[01:02:55.930 --> 01:02:58.410]  once you get in a restaurant, you're there forever.
[01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:00.570]  They're not, that thing's not going anywhere.
[01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:04.350]  It doesn't, it doesn't matter if you die or get canceled or anything.
[01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:08.010]  Once they hang a photo up in a restaurant, it's never coming down.
[01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:13.110]  And then two, maybe we could break some kind of a record to be like the celebrity,
[01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:17.110]  not that we're celebrities, but the podcast or the group with the most
[01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:20.470]  photos hanging in restaurants around the world.
[01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:25.090]  Do you think it's like the Hollywood Walk of Fame where they're charging these
[01:03:25.090 --> 01:03:27.670]  celebrities for their hot dog buns to maintain the space?
[01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:30.150]  You have to pay a secret fee.
[01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:32.350]  Dude, I wish I did, but I don't think so.
[01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:36.130]  I mean, they'll probably charge us, but that's fine.
[01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:38.290]  Oh, 100% we're getting charged for that.
[01:03:38.350 --> 01:03:42.490]  We do not based on merit or there is no reason for us to be on this wall
[01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:44.170]  outside of we paid for a spot.
[01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:46.150]  These are all the different ones I took while I was there.
[01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:50.770]  Hall & Oates, Billy Joel, Willard Scott.
[01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:54.410]  I don't know why I took a picture of AJ in Cronauer.
[01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:56.010]  I think it was to show Emily's dad, maybe.
[01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:57.470]  And then Kevin Costner.
[01:03:57.550 --> 01:04:00.690]  I took a picture of anybody that I thought was associated with our podcast in any way.
[01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:02.830]  So have they written on the actual bun?
[01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:05.250]  Yeah, it looks like it.
[01:04:05.410 --> 01:04:06.650]  And then the bun's been resined.
[01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:08.050]  I guess so, yeah.
[01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:14.170]  You think Hall & Oates recover from their beef at the hot dog bun being like,
[01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:15.370]  hey, remember the good times?
[01:04:15.610 --> 01:04:18.430]  And they each put their hand on the bun and their friends.
[01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:20.370]  Yeah, like, you're left bun, I'm right bun.
[01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:21.250]  Let's be buns together.
[01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:27.650]  Anyway, that's my idea is that we get a celebrity, like a photo headshot type thing made.
[01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:30.850]  And then we just somehow put it in the hands of every restaurant in the world.
[01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:32.290]  I think some would go up.
[01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:34.910]  Guarantee some would go up.
[01:04:34.930 --> 01:04:37.630]  I guarantee you there are people listening to this podcast right now
[01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:40.010]  that work at restaurants that are like, send it to me.
[01:04:40.050 --> 01:04:40.650]  I'll put it up tomorrow.
[01:04:41.350 --> 01:04:44.210]  If we finally franchise that melting pot, we can put one up there.
[01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:54.650]  This is, I think, the most concerned I've been at the start of a Jeff Idea on board by the end.
[01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:55.570]  I think I've ever been.
[01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:57.390]  What was your original concern?
[01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:59.190]  But I didn't.
[01:04:59.530 --> 01:05:03.790]  He posted a photo of Michael J. Fox that said, try the shakes on it.
[01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:06.550]  And I was worried what direction we were going in.
[01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:12.210]  I thought we ran the possibility of it being a very tasteless joke.
[01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:16.470]  I didn't even make the connection.
[01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:21.030]  My brain immediately went there and I went, what are we doing?
[01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:25.090]  I was immediately laughing at that because it's in different pen like someone else wrote it on.
[01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:27.970]  No, I literally just Googled.
[01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:29.650]  Here, I'll show you.
[01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:35.770]  I was terrified of like, what are you doing?
[01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:37.930]  I'm horrified now because that sounds.
[01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:43.670]  And then it became clear that that is not at all what you're trying to reference.
[01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:46.510]  And I was like, okay, we're good.
[01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:47.070]  Jesus.
[01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:48.090]  It's the first one.
[01:05:48.270 --> 01:05:51.810]  I searched for celebrity autograph photo diner.
[01:05:52.650 --> 01:05:54.630]  And Michael J. Fox is the very first one.
[01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:55.890]  I just grabbed it because it was first.
[01:05:55.970 --> 01:05:56.630]  I had nothing to do.
[01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:58.370]  Jeff, I didn't make the connection either.
[01:05:58.530 --> 01:05:59.330]  I didn't.
[01:05:59.370 --> 01:06:02.230]  It didn't, the joke didn't occur to me at all.
[01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:04.450]  I instantly looked at it and went, what are we doing?
[01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:05.790]  No, I had no idea.
[01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:08.470]  It must be generational or something because Eric and I didn't get there.
[01:06:08.730 --> 01:06:15.290]  Oh, but you can see from my Google search, if you search celebrity autograph photo diner,
[01:06:15.450 --> 01:06:16.110]  that's the photo.
[01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:20.270]  Oh, damn, man.
[01:06:21.130 --> 01:06:24.750]  I'm so glad that that was like a wholesome, like, yeah, that's a fun.
[01:06:24.830 --> 01:06:26.070]  Let's send diners buns.
[01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:27.930]  Could it be more wholesome?
[01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:29.490]  I don't want to send buns, just autograph photos.
[01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:30.930]  Could it be more wholesome?
[01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:31.810]  Nothing biodegradable.
[01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:34.690]  Oh, love it.
[01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:35.930]  That was a good app.
[01:06:36.270 --> 01:06:36.690]  Good app.
[01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:39.630]  God, I almost canceled myself in the last five minutes.
[01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:43.150]  I was like, what are we?
[01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:44.370]  Oh, boy.
[01:06:45.590 --> 01:06:47.310]  I'm worried about this direction.
[01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:49.310]  And then, yeah, all good.
[01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:50.910]  That was fun.
[01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:55.230]  Let's do, let's wrap this up and then record something else.
[01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:58.170]  We're recording a special video after this, right?
[01:06:59.030 --> 01:06:59.750]  Should we say what it is?
[01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.890]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:01.470]  Why wouldn't we?
[01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:04.230]  I think we're recording our first sausage talk.
[01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:10.230]  First regulation sausage talk with questions submitted by members of the falcon tier of our
[01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:10.570]  Patreon.
[01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:13.810]  I would even, I'd record another episode if we could.
[01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:15.270]  I'm having fun.
[01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:18.590]  Yeah, you said you're a two a day guy this morning and then you disappeared.
[01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:19.750]  I, well, yeah.
[01:07:19.890 --> 01:07:22.550]  Well, no, I was just saying that you went back to sleep.
[01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.890]  No, I didn't.
[01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:25.130]  I was awake the whole time.
[01:07:25.210 --> 01:07:26.490]  I just, I said my statement.
[01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:27.770]  I didn't want to start a fight.
[01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:31.670]  I was a little gun shy after the ricochets from the last thing I said.
[01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:36.890]  But what, but was, were you saying that because we're recording two today?
[01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:43.090]  No, I was saying that because I, there is a level of fear going into these recordings
[01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:45.110]  that is like, oh man, I really hope it's good.
[01:07:45.170 --> 01:07:45.850]  I'm really excited.
[01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:47.370]  But like, I hope I deliver.
[01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:51.810]  And when we do two, we just deal with that all in one day.
[01:07:51.870 --> 01:07:53.150]  And I don't like that.
[01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:55.010]  I'm now going to have to do this again tomorrow.
[01:07:55.010 --> 01:07:57.330]  Like getting all your work done on a Monday sort of feeling?
[01:07:58.570 --> 01:08:01.230]  Yeah, it's just, it's, it's not even getting all my work done.
[01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:03.710]  It's the work that I find I'm most nervous about.
[01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:05.270]  Like, I really want this to be good.
[01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:09.730]  And like, I feel like I need to be on my game for, and just stretch it out over two days.
[01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:13.130]  I'm, I'm, I think I prefer, because I feel like I could do six right now.
[01:08:13.170 --> 01:08:17.570]  Do you not feel like you have the same feeling about video game content we make?
[01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:18.310]  Not at all.
[01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.670]  No.
[01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:19.330]  Oh, okay.
[01:08:19.770 --> 01:08:21.530]  Because like the video game does a lot of the heavy lifting.
[01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:23.890]  Yeah, I feel like the video game is like, it opens.
[01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:26.770]  I don't have to prep in the same way for it.
[01:08:26.890 --> 01:08:29.610]  Like it will, things will emerge from that, that I can just react to.
[01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:33.230]  Where this is like, I need to take notes and make sure of my images.
[01:08:33.610 --> 01:08:36.710]  And you can sit down at just about any video game situation,
[01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:39.210]  completely blind and eke out a video pretty easily.
[01:08:39.330 --> 01:08:42.330]  But this podcast is a whole different animal for me, at least.
[01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:43.370]  I completely agree.
[01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:45.390]  I've got so many notes.
[01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:47.330]  I'm excited for the next one.
[01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:48.770]  I got a lot of stuff to talk about.
[01:08:49.290 --> 01:08:50.510]  Well, let's get to it.
[01:08:51.190 --> 01:08:52.090]  Let's, yeah, let's wrap up.
[01:08:52.450 --> 01:08:52.990]  Do you have a game?
[01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:54.650]  I have a game for us to play.
[01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:55.530]  Oh, shit.
[01:08:55.790 --> 01:08:56.490]  Oh, god damn.
[01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:57.130]  Oh, definitely.
[01:08:57.310 --> 01:08:57.850]  That's great.
[01:08:58.150 --> 01:08:58.630]  Another game.
[01:08:59.810 --> 01:09:00.070]  All right.
[01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:01.530]  Well, somebody end it.
[01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:02.990]  Bye.
[01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:08.610]  Oh, that make, I, this whole show, I've been trying to figure out what this note means.
[01:09:08.610 --> 01:09:09.470]  And it's my game.
[01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:10.930]  I just wrote it horribly.
[01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:14.590]  But I've been, I've been quietly looking at it like bog roll folders going,
[01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:15.890]  what is this?
[01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:17.190]  What does this mean?
