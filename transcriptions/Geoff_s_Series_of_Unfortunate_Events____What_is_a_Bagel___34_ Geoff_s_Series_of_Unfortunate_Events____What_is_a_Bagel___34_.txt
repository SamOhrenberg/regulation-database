[00:25.840 --> 00:29.300]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:29.300 --> 00:31.680]  This is episode 34. My name is Jeff Ramsey.
[00:31.880 --> 00:33.780]  With me, as always, the other idiots.
[00:34.120 --> 00:38.500]  Also known as Andrew, Gavin, Nick, and Lil Lyric.
[00:38.820 --> 00:39.120]  Hello.
[00:39.680 --> 00:39.800]  Hello.
[00:40.260 --> 00:42.320]  What channel was 34 for you?
[00:42.940 --> 00:43.720]  On TV?
[00:44.120 --> 00:45.020]  In the past?
[00:45.160 --> 00:46.440]  Do you remember what 34 was?
[00:46.540 --> 00:47.360]  Did you have a channel 34?
[00:47.560 --> 00:49.620]  Man, you know, that's so weird.
[00:49.660 --> 00:53.240]  Because for me, I feel like TV went from 12 channels to a thousand.
[00:53.620 --> 00:56.200]  And I don't know that I ever had a 34.
[00:56.760 --> 00:59.920]  Channel 34 for me growing up was Comedy Central.
[01:00.500 --> 01:02.480]  Let's watch some Cheers during the day.
[01:02.580 --> 01:04.620]  That's a good one. Comedy Central was 48.
[01:04.880 --> 01:08.680]  I think TBS or TNT was 34. They switched at one point.
[01:09.200 --> 01:10.680]  Ooh, 33 was TBS.
[01:11.280 --> 01:13.860]  Were you like a type the channel number in kind of guy?
[01:14.300 --> 01:15.220]  No, I just scroll.
[01:15.900 --> 01:19.700]  That was my first version of scrolling was just sitting with the remote going up
[01:19.700 --> 01:21.580]  non-stop until I found something.
[01:21.680 --> 01:24.840]  You didn't just look at the guide where you could see like 10 things at once?
[01:24.840 --> 01:25.900]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:25.920 --> 01:27.260]  Listen, this was pre-guide, man.
[01:27.380 --> 01:31.500]  This was you got to go to channel three and see the channel where it told you
[01:31.500 --> 01:33.020]  what was playing on all the channels.
[01:34.060 --> 01:38.420]  Yeah, this was like I remember pre-guide where you would just you'd have to go to 99
[01:38.420 --> 01:41.580]  and that would be all of the channel scrolling.
[01:41.980 --> 01:43.660]  And then you would start it too.
[01:43.840 --> 01:44.780]  There was nothing on one.
[01:45.000 --> 01:48.020]  You would start at two and then scroll.
[01:48.300 --> 01:50.640]  Just go up USA, ESPN, local.
[01:50.880 --> 01:52.580]  And then like you just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:52.680 --> 01:54.080]  And then you go through all of them.
[01:54.080 --> 01:57.140]  I just don't think I had satellite before I had.
[01:57.300 --> 02:00.720]  I think when I had pre-guide TV, I just had five channels.
[02:01.240 --> 02:05.300]  Ah, you missed out because there are times, you know, when it was when it was bad.
[02:05.520 --> 02:07.440]  You just watch the channel scroll channel.
[02:07.680 --> 02:08.620]  There's nothing else on.
[02:09.120 --> 02:12.780]  Or you just turn on the weather channel and jam out to that music.
[02:12.860 --> 02:16.700]  Listen, I got the weather channel on all the time in December.
[02:16.860 --> 02:18.520]  I'm a big weather channel guy in December.
[02:18.840 --> 02:19.180]  Love it.
[02:19.260 --> 02:19.980]  Great music.
[02:20.380 --> 02:20.940]  Great music.
[02:20.940 --> 02:26.700]  I think, I think that as people, we really lost out when channel surfing went away.
[02:27.060 --> 02:31.600]  There's, there's like analysis paralysis now because you could be watching
[02:32.220 --> 02:37.380]  an Oscar worthy movie, but you want to just put something on.
[02:37.400 --> 02:40.020]  And so you don't choose like the really, really good thing.
[02:40.040 --> 02:42.240]  And I think it just, I think it's preventative.
[02:42.360 --> 02:43.820]  It's sad that we can't scroll.
[02:44.060 --> 02:46.500]  Yeah, but everyone just scrolls in their phone and it's way worse.
[02:49.180 --> 02:50.260]  You know what?
[02:50.400 --> 02:51.780]  Hey, when you're right, you're right, man.
[02:52.860 --> 02:56.140]  I remember when I first got sky, like satellite TV.
[02:56.660 --> 03:01.300]  If, uh, if someone in my family was watching the old school terrestrial channels,
[03:02.040 --> 03:05.840]  I could mash buttons on the sky remote and it would make the picture go like,
[03:06.820 --> 03:09.080]  make it like do little farts of noise.
[03:09.560 --> 03:12.460]  And, uh, it was really starting to piss people off.
[03:13.180 --> 03:14.960]  Oh, that's fantastic.
[03:14.960 --> 03:17.920]  Whenever we're done with TV, I have a I have a series of
[03:17.920 --> 03:19.960]  misfortunate events I wanted to share with you guys.
[03:20.200 --> 03:21.400]  Oh, no.
[03:24.120 --> 03:25.200]  I don't know.
[03:25.380 --> 03:29.440]  Jeff, I was thinking about this relating to your misfortunate events.
[03:29.740 --> 03:31.620]  I don't get the same joy from them anymore.
[03:31.700 --> 03:32.520]  It's really sad.
[03:33.080 --> 03:34.320]  It's really unfortunate.
[03:34.680 --> 03:39.100]  Now that we're a small company, the you having to endure
[03:39.100 --> 03:42.020]  through things is infinitely less enjoyable.
[03:42.100 --> 03:44.440]  Oh, my God, dude, I'm in a situation right now.
[03:44.440 --> 03:47.840]  I'm not even talking about it where, you know, I'm still experiencing the jaw thing.
[03:47.940 --> 03:49.480]  Yeah, still working through that.
[03:49.640 --> 03:54.340]  Seeing doctors and scientists and fucking NASA and stuff to try to figure out what's going on.
[03:54.600 --> 04:01.660]  But there's some concern that one of the New Jersey drones might be in my jaw.
[04:02.320 --> 04:04.360]  Might have appeared out of the ocean.
[04:04.520 --> 04:05.000]  You're the mothership.
[04:05.320 --> 04:06.240]  Yeah, I might be.
[04:06.340 --> 04:07.420]  They might be coming from me.
[04:08.020 --> 04:12.000]  But also my wife every year, you know, she has to work like crazy around the holidays
[04:12.000 --> 04:13.940]  because people don't stop getting their hair cut.
[04:13.940 --> 04:17.360]  You know, if anything, they need it more around the holidays for parties and stuff.
[04:17.540 --> 04:20.740]  And so she can't just like it's not a nine to five where you walk away.
[04:20.820 --> 04:24.260]  You know, she has to cram those people in before she can take off.
[04:24.340 --> 04:28.640]  And so she always gets like bronchitis or the flu or a cold or something
[04:28.640 --> 04:30.520]  because she's working like 12 hour days.
[04:30.620 --> 04:33.500]  So she is dying, but still having to work 12 hours a day.
[04:33.660 --> 04:39.140]  Albert somehow, even though he has his vaccination, got kennel cough.
[04:39.740 --> 04:42.220]  Oh, at the puppy daycare place.
[04:42.240 --> 04:43.180]  I don't think I mentioned that to y'all.
[04:43.180 --> 04:49.380]  So Albert has been dying and like you have to watch him to make sure because as bulldogs,
[04:49.460 --> 04:56.060]  if anything impacts their airways, they can or like any kind of regurge is really dangerous
[04:56.060 --> 04:56.460]  for them.
[04:56.620 --> 05:01.140]  Like you cannot let bulldogs throw up because they'll get if their airway gets constricted
[05:01.140 --> 05:03.880]  at all, they'll get bronchitis almost immediately and they can die.
[05:03.980 --> 05:06.220]  That's what happened to Henry near the end.
[05:06.300 --> 05:09.200]  We had to rush him to the emergency room and they had to put him in like they put him
[05:09.200 --> 05:13.060]  in like an air chamber, you know, where they're like pushing air into him to keep him
[05:13.060 --> 05:13.340]  safe.
[05:13.800 --> 05:18.040]  And so I got to like check Albert every three hours and make sure his gums are pink and
[05:18.040 --> 05:18.280]  shit.
[05:18.340 --> 05:21.960]  And like he's on the mend and all this time I've been going through the mouth stuff and
[05:21.960 --> 05:27.640]  I've just been, you know, quietly miserable trying to take care of my family.
[05:28.200 --> 05:33.860]  This fucking yesterday, day before yesterday, the Christmas presents I ordered for you
[05:33.860 --> 05:34.440]  guys came in.
[05:34.760 --> 05:35.780]  I was very excited.
[05:35.960 --> 05:39.220]  Andrew, yours didn't obviously because I had to ship it to Canada and yours is a little
[05:39.220 --> 05:39.580]  different.
[05:39.960 --> 05:41.420]  Let me just let you know what I got.
[05:41.420 --> 05:43.580]  Everybody else wasn't available to go to Canada.
[05:43.620 --> 05:46.220]  So I got you something unique and different and it should arrive today.
[05:46.720 --> 05:51.300]  But I got the boxes in and then I realized I had gotten presents for Andrew.
[05:51.480 --> 05:52.200]  Yours was on the way.
[05:52.480 --> 05:54.260]  Gavin, Nick and Eric.
[05:55.080 --> 05:56.360]  And so I got one of each.
[05:56.500 --> 05:59.100]  They arrived in two boxes and I thought that's weird.
[05:59.560 --> 06:04.560]  And I realized, no, there's only one of each in the boxes.
[06:04.660 --> 06:05.620]  So I'm short one.
[06:06.280 --> 06:07.440]  Eric and Nick were together.
[06:07.820 --> 06:11.260]  So as soon as I got it, because it's refrigerated, I drove over and gave them their
[06:11.260 --> 06:11.780]  presents.
[06:12.020 --> 06:15.860]  And then I went home and I was trying to figure out where the other box was.
[06:15.960 --> 06:17.720]  And I'll be honest, Gold Belly.
[06:17.720 --> 06:18.640]  I got it from Gold Belly.
[06:18.680 --> 06:19.760]  Gold Belly was down.
[06:20.120 --> 06:21.180]  The app was down and I couldn't see.
[06:21.240 --> 06:22.000]  And I freaked out.
[06:22.040 --> 06:23.400]  And so I bought another one.
[06:23.460 --> 06:25.080]  I thought maybe I screwed up and I only bought two.
[06:25.300 --> 06:27.440]  So I bought another one for Gavin.
[06:28.320 --> 06:29.020]  Why did you?
[06:29.080 --> 06:30.320]  Why did you freak out?
[06:30.620 --> 06:33.620]  Because I didn't want Gavin not to have a gift and I'd already delivered y'alls.
[06:34.580 --> 06:35.760]  And you know what I mean?
[06:35.780 --> 06:38.160]  He's like my fucking very best friend on Earth.
[06:38.220 --> 06:39.460]  I don't want him to get slighted.
[06:39.460 --> 06:41.380]  And so of course, buddy.
[06:41.640 --> 06:45.120]  And so I I ordered one more for Gavin.
[06:45.160 --> 06:49.360]  I thought if Gavin's was like late for some reason, it didn't ship at the same time or
[06:49.360 --> 06:49.580]  whatever.
[06:49.700 --> 06:50.300]  No big deal.
[06:50.400 --> 06:52.480]  I'll have one for me or I'll give it to somebody else.
[06:54.460 --> 06:56.460]  Yesterday, I got four of them.
[06:56.580 --> 07:00.820]  I got the one for Gavin and the three additional I apparently ordered when I thought I was
[07:00.820 --> 07:01.920]  ordering one for Gavin.
[07:03.660 --> 07:07.280]  So now I have four of these gifts to give three people.
[07:07.520 --> 07:09.060]  Six of these gifts to give three people.
[07:09.060 --> 07:10.140]  It's quite a big gift.
[07:10.460 --> 07:10.820]  Yeah.
[07:11.400 --> 07:13.280]  And so it's refrigerated.
[07:13.340 --> 07:15.120]  And this is like seven o'clock at night.
[07:15.200 --> 07:16.840]  I'm not driving this shit around at seven o'clock at night.
[07:16.880 --> 07:18.280]  I'm still not quite sure what to do with it.
[07:18.620 --> 07:23.980]  So I have to take and unbox the gifts.
[07:24.300 --> 07:28.120]  I have to take everything out of the packages, the ceiling and everything because it's
[07:28.120 --> 07:30.280]  refrigerated and I got to put it into my refrigerator.
[07:30.520 --> 07:32.940]  So I got to clean my refrigerator completely out.
[07:33.300 --> 07:35.580]  Actually, I say I, Emily did a lot of this work.
[07:35.580 --> 07:41.100]  You have to clean the refrigerator completely out to completely disassemble your gifts to
[07:41.100 --> 07:43.140]  then cram them in to the fridge.
[07:43.280 --> 07:46.920]  And so this morning, and I'm also still a one car family because there's a my car's
[07:46.920 --> 07:47.720]  been in the shop for three weeks.
[07:47.780 --> 07:48.760]  I don't know if I mentioned that to you guys.
[07:49.200 --> 07:52.180]  And so sorry, Gavin, your car has been in the shop for three weeks because they cannot
[07:52.180 --> 07:52.820]  fix this.
[07:53.040 --> 07:54.320]  They cannot fix the speaker.
[07:54.680 --> 07:58.260]  The fucking speaker is causing all kinds of problems at BMW.
[07:58.400 --> 08:00.060]  They can't figure out how to fix a speaker in a door.
[08:02.000 --> 08:07.340]  It's you know, speakers indoors were so complicated and convoluted and had so many moving parts
[08:07.340 --> 08:08.680]  that have to be replaced and tested.
[08:09.700 --> 08:14.060]  Anyway, so I get up this morning, I drive Emily to work and then I drop her off and then
[08:14.060 --> 08:19.700]  I get myself a taco and then I race home and I take all of the gifts out of the fridge
[08:19.700 --> 08:23.840]  and then I have to reassemble the boxes and the packages and put them all back together
[08:23.840 --> 08:25.440]  the way they fit and cram them in.
[08:25.820 --> 08:28.240]  And then I drove and I have four packages.
[08:28.340 --> 08:29.160]  I keep one for myself.
[08:29.160 --> 08:33.940]  I drive one to Gavin and then I drive one to Bernie and Vanessa, drop one off at their
[08:33.940 --> 08:36.080]  house because I love them dearly and I want them to enjoy this.
[08:36.140 --> 08:39.320]  And then I take the other one to my cousin and his husband and let them have it.
[08:39.720 --> 08:43.900]  And then at some point while I'm driving around, I get like a notification on SimpliSafe
[08:43.900 --> 08:45.100]  that's like, power's out at your house.
[08:45.220 --> 08:46.200]  Actually, I didn't get the notification.
[08:46.380 --> 08:46.780]  Emily did.
[08:46.880 --> 08:47.720]  And I go, oh, that's weird.
[08:48.200 --> 08:49.240]  And she's like, are you at home?
[08:49.300 --> 08:49.700]  What's going on?
[08:49.720 --> 08:50.840]  And I go, no, I don't think so.
[08:51.900 --> 08:53.760]  Millie's there, but no, I'm not aware of any power outages.
[08:53.860 --> 08:55.520]  I don't actually get the SimpliSafe notification.
[08:55.620 --> 08:55.980]  She does.
[08:56.260 --> 08:57.080]  Then she goes, never mind.
[08:57.120 --> 08:57.820]  It's back on immediately.
[08:57.820 --> 08:58.780]  I'm like, OK, whatever.
[08:58.880 --> 08:59.200]  No problem.
[08:59.540 --> 09:02.900]  So I finish because you guys all live so fucking far away from each other, by the way.
[09:03.000 --> 09:06.560]  You and Chris and Bernie and Vanessa are not close.
[09:07.600 --> 09:13.240]  And so after like two hours of driving all around, I come home, take care of the dog,
[09:13.480 --> 09:18.500]  have some soda, kind of get comfortable, say good morning to Millie and stuff.
[09:18.780 --> 09:21.440]  Come in here because I got to do a couple of thumbnails for Nick.
[09:21.760 --> 09:22.900]  Sit down to do the thumbnails.
[09:23.260 --> 09:24.180]  My Xbox is off.
[09:24.280 --> 09:25.380]  And I think, oh, that's weird.
[09:25.760 --> 09:26.040]  I didn't.
[09:26.120 --> 09:27.400]  I left it on because I was playing Call of Duty.
[09:27.400 --> 09:28.520]  And then I go, oh, wait a minute.
[09:28.580 --> 09:29.320]  No, the power went out.
[09:29.380 --> 09:29.660]  That's right.
[09:29.700 --> 09:30.340]  My Xbox is off.
[09:30.420 --> 09:31.060]  Everything is off.
[09:31.240 --> 09:32.280]  So I turn on my Mac.
[09:32.540 --> 09:34.480]  I turn on the my Xbox and stuff.
[09:34.580 --> 09:35.460]  Turn on my PC.
[09:35.880 --> 09:36.860]  Start logging into the Mac.
[09:36.980 --> 09:39.460]  Turn around to go pick up the Xbox controller to play a game of Call of Duty.
[09:39.740 --> 09:40.980]  Realize that the screen's not on.
[09:41.000 --> 09:41.620]  I'm like, that's weird.
[09:42.000 --> 09:43.520]  Hit the power button on my PC again.
[09:43.620 --> 09:43.900]  Nothing.
[09:44.180 --> 09:44.600]  Hit it again.
[09:44.680 --> 09:44.960]  Nothing.
[09:45.200 --> 09:45.840]  That's weird.
[09:47.360 --> 09:49.260]  Start the process of unplugging and plugging in.
[09:49.340 --> 09:50.420]  I got bad power supply.
[09:50.520 --> 09:54.160]  I think that whatever that power outage was today nuked my fucking PC.
[09:54.160 --> 09:58.520]  So now I can no longer capture any kind of game footage.
[09:59.140 --> 10:00.100]  Oh, man.
[10:00.240 --> 10:05.680]  Now, we're OK because we are we're doing live action tomorrow and we don't have any
[10:05.680 --> 10:07.300]  game capture this week.
[10:07.460 --> 10:10.060]  So I have this from today to this weekend to figure it out.
[10:10.140 --> 10:14.940]  So then I'm like, I'm 20 years past being a computer guy, right?
[10:15.020 --> 10:16.300]  15 years past being a computer guy.
[10:16.400 --> 10:19.860]  But I pull the power supply out and I make sure it's definitely not turning on.
[10:19.860 --> 10:24.920]  You know, I try everything I can think of different outlets, different power cables.
[10:25.060 --> 10:26.940]  It clearly seems to be a busted power supply.
[10:27.020 --> 10:29.620]  That's fine because my computer was making a weird noise a while ago and I thought it
[10:29.620 --> 10:30.840]  might have been a fan in the power supply.
[10:31.780 --> 10:33.600]  So I'm looking at it and I don't understand.
[10:33.980 --> 10:36.180]  I don't understand the back of a fucking power supply now.
[10:36.320 --> 10:39.420]  I just take pictures of everything so I know where to plug it back in.
[10:40.000 --> 10:41.360]  And I Google it.
[10:41.580 --> 10:45.880]  It's a Corsair 850 and there's a million of them and I can even get one today.
[10:45.900 --> 10:46.980]  And I'm like, this is fucking awesome.
[10:47.040 --> 10:47.960]  And so I start looking at them.
[10:47.960 --> 10:49.020]  And of course, they're all new.
[10:49.020 --> 10:53.220]  And the backs look totally different, like not even the same shit.
[10:53.240 --> 10:56.240]  And I'm like, oh, this I'm officially too dumb to solve this.
[10:56.520 --> 10:59.500]  I bought this PC from Origin PC in 2020.
[10:59.740 --> 11:02.880]  I doubt it's under warranty, but I bet they can at least point me in the right direction.
[11:03.320 --> 11:06.240]  Maybe I can buy a power supply for them or they can help me get the right one.
[11:06.300 --> 11:07.420]  So I call up their support.
[11:09.140 --> 11:10.980]  Useless, useless, unhelpful people.
[11:11.880 --> 11:15.220]  I love the Origin PC and I will buy another one.
[11:15.220 --> 11:19.420]  The conversation on the phone wasn't bad enough to make me not support the product anymore,
[11:19.600 --> 11:24.120]  but they got to do some work in their customer service and their tech support department.
[11:24.300 --> 11:27.240]  The guy was extremely unfriendly and unwilling to help.
[11:27.300 --> 11:29.480]  And I'm like, I'm just telling you they look different.
[11:29.500 --> 11:30.520]  And he's like, no, they don't.
[11:30.560 --> 11:33.560]  And I'm like, sir, I'm looking at one in my hand and a picture on the Internet.
[11:33.580 --> 11:34.960]  And I'm telling you the backs are different.
[11:35.200 --> 11:35.900]  I'm an idiot.
[11:35.920 --> 11:38.540]  I just need you to tell me if I buy the new one, am I OK?
[11:38.820 --> 11:39.560]  Can I buy one?
[11:39.620 --> 11:42.320]  I eventually had to hang up on the guy because he was no fucking help.
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.740]  Buy a refurbished one online because it looks exactly like the one I have on my desk right now.
[11:49.200 --> 11:53.460]  It's not going to get here till somewhere between December 27th and January 3rd.
[11:53.580 --> 11:55.440]  That is not acceptable for me.
[11:55.820 --> 12:00.720]  So I bought another one at Best Buy as soon as we're done recording a brand new one.
[12:00.800 --> 12:04.900]  I'm going to drive up to Best Buy and pick it up and then come home and try to figure
[12:04.900 --> 12:08.960]  out how to plug shit into a system that looks totally different than what I have.
[12:09.200 --> 12:11.720]  And if that doesn't work and the refurbished one doesn't work,
[12:11.720 --> 12:12.860]  I guess I buy a new computer.
[12:13.160 --> 12:15.680]  But this is me letting you guys know that I'm not going to be able to capture any
[12:15.680 --> 12:19.720]  gameplay for the next couple of days unless I figure out this fucking power supply problem
[12:19.720 --> 12:21.400]  that I'm too stupid to figure out.
[12:21.500 --> 12:22.760]  And that's been my morning.
[12:23.140 --> 12:23.880]  Shall I come over later?
[12:24.520 --> 12:25.080]  Maybe, yeah.
[12:25.160 --> 12:26.300]  After I go get the power supply.
[12:26.900 --> 12:28.820]  Can you just type in the number on the power supply?
[12:29.280 --> 12:30.180]  I did. I did.
[12:30.240 --> 12:30.860]  It just looks different.
[12:31.080 --> 12:32.660]  Like the new version of it looks different.
[12:32.900 --> 12:34.280]  I even typed in the model number and stuff.
[12:34.340 --> 12:37.780]  I was only able to find one refurbished one on the Corsair website, which I bought.
[12:38.080 --> 12:39.540]  But that's the one that won't be here for two weeks.
[12:39.980 --> 12:40.800]  Which part looks different?
[12:40.800 --> 12:42.180]  The inside part.
[12:42.200 --> 12:44.120]  No, all this shit that plugs in on the back is different.
[12:44.520 --> 12:47.380]  Different order, different nomenclature, different...
[12:47.380 --> 12:48.960]  I think the names don't even match up.
[12:49.320 --> 12:52.440]  I just want this to turn into Gavin looking at it and going,
[12:52.680 --> 12:53.500]  no, they don't look different.
[12:54.060 --> 12:54.640]  No, they're the same.
[12:54.860 --> 13:01.260]  There's nothing on the new Corsair that says 6 plus 2 PCIe and 4 by 4 CPU.
[13:01.600 --> 13:04.380]  There's nothing that says 24 pin and ATX.
[13:04.540 --> 13:09.300]  There's nothing that says 6 plus 2 PCIe plus 4B4 CPU.
[13:09.380 --> 13:10.180]  It's all different.
[13:10.180 --> 13:12.160]  There's stuff that says peripheral and SATA.
[13:12.760 --> 13:13.540]  That's the same.
[13:14.120 --> 13:16.360]  Yeah, but as long as it's got the same look and plugs.
[13:16.460 --> 13:17.460]  They're in different orders.
[13:17.800 --> 13:19.340]  Like, they're in totally different places.
[13:19.520 --> 13:21.360]  If they even looked the same, I'd be fine.
[13:21.700 --> 13:23.060]  I just don't know what to plug in where.
[13:23.120 --> 13:23.640]  I took pictures.
[13:23.820 --> 13:24.940]  I hope it's the same.
[13:25.020 --> 13:25.760]  It comes with cables.
[13:25.840 --> 13:27.200]  I'm sure it'll fucking work.
[13:27.360 --> 13:30.040]  But then, even after I get this figured out and plugged in,
[13:30.100 --> 13:31.260]  I don't know that the computer works.
[13:31.320 --> 13:33.120]  I don't know that it didn't fry everything in the computer.
[13:33.500 --> 13:36.300]  I think it's just the first step in getting the goddamn thing turned back on,
[13:36.340 --> 13:36.900]  you know what I mean?
[13:37.100 --> 13:39.160]  I didn't even think about that shit.
[13:39.160 --> 13:41.920]  Yeah, I've now bought two power supplies for a computer
[13:41.920 --> 13:43.340]  I don't know that'll ever work again.
[13:43.660 --> 13:47.560]  Just because I'm desperate to not be down when we need to work.
[13:47.700 --> 13:49.020]  That's like, you know, that's like...
[13:49.020 --> 13:53.380]  That is my biggest fear on earth, I think.
[13:53.760 --> 13:56.300]  Cancer and being down and not able to work.
[13:57.140 --> 13:57.940]  And so...
[13:57.940 --> 13:58.280]  And snakes.
[13:58.460 --> 13:58.780]  Those three.
[13:58.900 --> 14:02.080]  Snakes, cancer, being down and not able to work.
[14:02.140 --> 14:02.740]  In that order.
[14:03.720 --> 14:06.260]  Nah, maybe snakes, being down, cancer would be the order.
[14:06.660 --> 14:08.240]  But yeah, yeah, I think that's...
[14:08.900 --> 14:10.160]  That's got to be my top three.
[14:10.300 --> 14:12.420]  So I'm in my top three fear zones here.
[14:12.580 --> 14:14.340]  I'm not thinking straight.
[14:14.460 --> 14:15.240]  I'm not happy.
[14:15.380 --> 14:16.640]  I'm flustered and frustrated.
[14:16.820 --> 14:21.380]  I have to get past this problem or I won't have a moment of peace in my life.
[14:21.820 --> 14:26.540]  My brain will not let me live comfortably until it's fixed or I buy a new computer.
[14:26.800 --> 14:29.020]  I would say, why did you have a UPS?
[14:29.260 --> 14:33.360]  But I had that EMP on stream a few months ago that just flew right through mine.
[14:33.700 --> 14:37.940]  I was gonna buy a UPS with this, but I don't know if it fucking matters.
[14:37.940 --> 14:39.400]  Because of your experience.
[14:39.860 --> 14:40.680]  Yeah, who knows?
[14:41.320 --> 14:43.120]  Well, yeah, I can come and plug shit in.
[14:43.400 --> 14:43.860]  All right, man.
[14:43.980 --> 14:44.640]  I appreciate that.
[14:45.160 --> 14:46.980]  Also, did you get your Christmas present?
[14:47.420 --> 14:49.300]  I did. I moved it swiftly to the fridge.
[14:49.480 --> 14:49.960]  Okay, good.
[14:50.040 --> 14:51.780]  Well, now everybody but Andrew has theirs.
[14:51.880 --> 14:53.060]  But Andrew, yours is different.
[14:53.120 --> 14:59.040]  So I can say, happy holidays and Merry Christmas to my regulation best friends
[14:59.040 --> 15:01.320]  and coworkers and business partners.
[15:01.540 --> 15:03.040]  I love you all so much.
[15:03.080 --> 15:04.360]  I love you so dearly.
[15:04.360 --> 15:09.500]  This has been the year in many ways, I think, of the hot dog.
[15:10.080 --> 15:16.080]  And so I wanted to spread Christmas cheer, kind of like the hot dog Santa,
[15:16.240 --> 15:18.640]  who was a real figure in the 1920s and the 1930s,
[15:18.640 --> 15:21.320]  who I talk about on Saul Wright, I think, next week's episode.
[15:21.660 --> 15:23.440]  I wanted to give the gift of hot dogs.
[15:23.680 --> 15:26.440]  So I sent you guys packages from Grey's Papaya,
[15:26.700 --> 15:31.900]  which is a place that Meg took me and Emily and Gavin to in New York
[15:31.900 --> 15:33.100]  that we absolutely loved.
[15:33.100 --> 15:35.020]  And so, yeah, that's what I got you guys.
[15:35.100 --> 15:36.360]  And then Andrew, yours is totally different.
[15:37.940 --> 15:39.540]  So I'm not going to end the year on one.
[15:39.800 --> 15:40.360]  I thought I was.
[15:41.040 --> 15:41.580]  Oh, you better not.
[15:41.660 --> 15:43.540]  You better end on twelve or however many I got you.
[15:44.600 --> 15:45.760]  Am I going to get a power supply?
[15:46.700 --> 15:48.820]  Yeah, but the plugs are all fucked up, dude.
[15:48.820 --> 15:51.360]  I don't know if it's a refurbished one or a new one,
[15:51.380 --> 15:53.240]  but you're going to get whichever one doesn't work.
[15:53.240 --> 15:53.320]  Hell yeah.
[15:54.100 --> 15:54.280]  What?
[15:54.880 --> 15:55.640]  No, I just couldn't.
[15:55.720 --> 15:57.340]  I just couldn't get Grey's Papaya to Canada.
[15:57.480 --> 15:58.460]  So I had to send you something different.
[15:58.700 --> 15:59.320]  Update, update.
[15:59.920 --> 16:02.980]  As this episode is going on, Nick has updated his hot dog count.
[16:03.100 --> 16:03.880]  Are you serious?
[16:03.980 --> 16:05.140]  Are you eating hot dogs right now?
[16:05.540 --> 16:06.040]  Not right now.
[16:06.120 --> 16:07.720]  I forgot about it the other night when I had them,
[16:07.780 --> 16:10.240]  because I was like, oh, I'll wait until Gavin has his before I do.
[16:11.660 --> 16:15.860]  Also, to send three of you hot dogs packages,
[16:16.520 --> 16:18.280]  the price was the exact same.
[16:18.420 --> 16:20.780]  To give you an idea of the difference in America and Canada post,
[16:20.860 --> 16:22.260]  and this is something that we're all bitching about.
[16:23.320 --> 16:24.460]  It was cheaper.
[16:24.680 --> 16:25.680]  I think it was...
[16:25.680 --> 16:26.640]  I don't want to put a price tag on it,
[16:26.660 --> 16:29.420]  but let's say $100 for each package, right?
[16:29.460 --> 16:31.020]  Across the board, like if Andrew's was $100,
[16:31.160 --> 16:32.500]  y'all's was $100 across the board, right?
[16:33.100 --> 16:36.680]  To get the three of your packages sent to my house so I could distribute them
[16:36.680 --> 16:41.340]  was still cheaper at $300 plus shipping
[16:41.340 --> 16:46.300]  than it was to send Andrew's one $100 package,
[16:46.500 --> 16:51.840]  which cost something like four times the price of the product just to send it to him.
[16:52.080 --> 16:52.820]  Oh my God.
[16:52.840 --> 16:56.560]  Just to further illustrate that we have got to figure out
[16:56.560 --> 16:59.260]  how to send mail back and forth between our countries
[16:59.260 --> 17:02.740]  in a cost-effective way, because it just keeps getting worse.
[17:03.260 --> 17:04.520]  Oh, don't worry.
[17:04.640 --> 17:07.140]  I'm sure it's just about to get better, man.
[17:07.220 --> 17:10.820]  I'm sure we're just right on the cusp of it getting so good.
[17:11.180 --> 17:17.260]  I was just amazed it was cheaper to send three gifts to America
[17:17.260 --> 17:20.260]  than one gift to Canada for the exact same price.
[17:20.560 --> 17:22.100]  Is the postal strike over, Andrew?
[17:23.220 --> 17:24.040]  Sort of.
[17:24.800 --> 17:28.960]  They've been forced back to work because of the season,
[17:29.740 --> 17:32.480]  and they've been given permission to strike again
[17:32.480 --> 17:33.340]  in like May.
[17:33.460 --> 17:35.640]  I don't know if that's how strikes work,
[17:35.720 --> 17:39.460]  and I hope that people understand that.
[17:39.720 --> 17:41.620]  Hey, this is too inconvenient for us,
[17:41.640 --> 17:43.260]  so you just need to get back to it.
[17:43.520 --> 17:45.660]  Is there a Canadian polite strike?
[17:47.000 --> 17:49.100]  The Canada Post workers, not a fan,
[17:49.280 --> 17:51.780]  not happy with the decision that the government had made.
[17:52.180 --> 17:54.340]  The postal worker said, strike, eh?
[17:54.600 --> 17:56.580]  And the government said, strike, nay.
[17:58.840 --> 18:00.240]  You've been keeping up with our politics.
[18:02.700 --> 18:04.960]  I know you've zoned out of the US politics.
[18:05.100 --> 18:06.260]  You've moved on to Canada, clearly.
[18:06.640 --> 18:08.340]  You're all in on Canada politics.
[18:08.680 --> 18:09.860]  I almost...
[18:09.860 --> 18:13.380]  I tuned to NPR yesterday in my radio on accident.
[18:13.580 --> 18:14.960]  I flipped over and I went, oh, what am I doing?
[18:15.040 --> 18:16.400]  I fucking switched away to sports immediately.
[18:16.780 --> 18:17.240]  I didn't hear...
[18:17.240 --> 18:18.840]  I was still in a commercial, so I didn't hear anything.
[18:19.020 --> 18:20.400]  How did you hear it without a door speaker?
[18:20.940 --> 18:21.940]  I'm in Emily's car.
[18:22.860 --> 18:23.180]  Good, cool.
[18:23.640 --> 18:26.280]  Yeah, I was surprised when I came to the podcast today
[18:26.280 --> 18:28.380]  that Andrew wasn't there for pleasantries.
[18:28.940 --> 18:29.260]  Yeah!
[18:29.400 --> 18:29.780]  You noticed that?
[18:29.840 --> 18:30.560]  I showed up early.
[18:31.340 --> 18:31.520]  What?
[18:31.520 --> 18:33.060]  I showed up for pleasantries.
[18:33.200 --> 18:34.520]  You were... what do you mean?
[18:35.260 --> 18:37.340]  I was shocked you were there before I was.
[18:37.880 --> 18:40.400]  Well, that's because you were on time and Gavin was early.
[18:40.840 --> 18:41.160]  Right.
[18:41.700 --> 18:42.840]  Yeah, but Andrew wasn't early.
[18:43.580 --> 18:44.020]  Right.
[18:44.120 --> 18:45.560]  That's why I said Gavin...
[18:45.560 --> 18:49.060]  That's why I said you were on time and Gavin was early when I was talking to Andrew.
[18:49.640 --> 18:49.900]  Right.
[18:50.380 --> 18:50.640]  Yeah.
[18:50.720 --> 18:52.120]  I mean, I showed up 1058.
[18:52.300 --> 18:55.860]  There's typically... even when I show up two minutes before we record,
[18:55.960 --> 18:57.020]  there's a little bit of pleasantries.
[18:57.420 --> 18:58.920]  Was it 1058 when he showed up?
[18:59.280 --> 18:59.740]  It was.
[19:01.100 --> 19:01.900]  I don't...
[19:01.900 --> 19:02.960]  I looked at the clock.
[19:04.640 --> 19:08.740]  I know it was 1058 because I saw Gavin in there and I went, what the fuck?
[19:08.760 --> 19:10.820]  And I looked at the timer in the bottom right.
[19:10.920 --> 19:11.540]  It said 1058.
[19:12.020 --> 19:14.180]  And I joined to be like, what's going on?
[19:14.400 --> 19:14.900]  The timer.
[19:15.120 --> 19:18.680]  I was here half an hour early just hoping somebody was going to show up.
[19:19.120 --> 19:21.680]  I've never met somebody who calls the clock the timer.
[19:24.920 --> 19:26.540]  I just looked at my waveform.
[19:26.540 --> 19:31.360]  I didn't take a breath from four minutes to 14 minutes of this podcast.
[19:31.620 --> 19:32.300]  Jesus Christ.
[19:32.360 --> 19:34.280]  You really wanted to let us know.
[19:34.680 --> 19:35.860]  No, no, no need to apologize.
[19:35.860 --> 19:37.800]  You had a lot to get through.
[19:37.960 --> 19:39.780]  Yeah, I don't, I don't blame you.
[19:40.260 --> 19:40.960]  Not at all.
[19:41.300 --> 19:41.960]  Oh God.
[19:42.440 --> 19:46.280]  This is... we've discussed before, therapy essentially for us.
[19:46.660 --> 19:48.240]  And that was clearly a session.
[19:48.720 --> 19:50.540]  I think it's great that you got it all out.
[19:50.580 --> 19:53.680]  Because last time it was us talking about the most soupable marsupial.
[19:53.680 --> 19:56.480]  So I get this, it's a nice change of pace.
[19:56.600 --> 19:58.200]  I guess when you get into it, you know what I mean?
[19:59.060 --> 20:02.900]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[20:03.240 --> 20:06.120]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love.
[20:06.200 --> 20:09.800]  Now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[20:10.260 --> 20:11.700]  Available for a limited time.
[20:11.940 --> 20:14.160]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[20:15.820 --> 20:16.460]  Raise the rudders.
[20:16.960 --> 20:17.740]  Raise the sails.
[20:17.880 --> 20:18.900]  Raise the sails.
[20:19.360 --> 20:21.480]  Captain, an unidentified ship is approaching.

[20:44.280 --> 20:47.880]  People think I'm pretty off base with the old bagel analysis.
[20:47.880 --> 20:48.140]  Do they?
[20:48.560 --> 20:49.200]  Yeah.
[20:49.720 --> 20:50.220]  Oh no.
[20:50.780 --> 20:54.200]  I think I've just got to get I've got to get some East Coast bagels down my gut.
[20:54.240 --> 20:57.000]  I, you know, I think it's what about the spread?
[20:57.360 --> 20:59.260]  I think there's a lot of factors to this.
[20:59.800 --> 21:01.700]  Well, I think the biggest factor is that these people are
[21:01.700 --> 21:07.220]  are placing their own local bagel biases against Gavin's.
[21:07.280 --> 21:10.260]  If you're on the East Coast, of course, you're going to get better bagels.
[21:10.480 --> 21:13.740]  They're amazing on the East Coast, but that's not the reality that Gavin lives in.
[21:13.860 --> 21:17.800]  Gavin lives in Austin, Texas, where which is a mediocre at best bagel town.
[21:17.800 --> 21:21.340]  And so for what's available to him, I think his decision makes total sense.
[21:21.880 --> 21:24.540]  I just I think bagels are really fun food.
[21:24.980 --> 21:25.660]  I agree.
[21:26.240 --> 21:30.140]  To be to cancel bagels from your life, I just think it's sad.
[21:30.460 --> 21:33.080]  Well, why don't we why don't you make me a bagel?
[21:33.360 --> 21:33.640]  Me?
[21:34.180 --> 21:34.440]  Yeah.
[21:34.520 --> 21:36.280]  Oh, you won't like my bagel.
[21:36.360 --> 21:40.040]  This is like last time when you asked him, what was his bagel order?
[21:40.160 --> 21:41.300]  And he said, what do you mean?
[21:41.580 --> 21:43.680]  And then he said, why don't you make me a bagel?
[21:44.100 --> 21:44.400]  Me?
[21:45.100 --> 21:45.420]  Green.
[21:45.940 --> 21:49.380]  No, listen, you're not going to like not going to like my bagels.
[21:49.540 --> 21:50.340]  How do you know?
[21:50.840 --> 21:51.720]  Because I know you.
[21:51.920 --> 21:53.720]  Listen, we did 24 days of snacking.
[21:53.860 --> 21:57.280]  The last bagel he designed shut a business down, dude.
[21:58.640 --> 22:06.460]  I wouldn't say that, but yeah, I like a plain I'm a pretty plain bagel guy.
[22:06.580 --> 22:13.000]  So I don't think that my bagel preferences would sway you in any way.
[22:13.560 --> 22:17.480]  But I do think you need to figure out what exactly you think is the ideal
[22:18.220 --> 22:22.040]  spread or topping on a bagel, because it might not just be the bagel.
[22:22.120 --> 22:22.660]  It might be you.
[22:22.720 --> 22:24.640]  You just don't you haven't found that match yet.
[22:24.700 --> 22:28.100]  The pair between the bagel itself and what is on it.
[22:28.340 --> 22:30.520]  What if you think sliced pineapple?
[22:30.700 --> 22:32.300]  I made a fruit bagel.
[22:34.320 --> 22:35.980]  It'd be goopy and wet.
[22:36.520 --> 22:40.280]  Yeah, I'm not sure what.
[22:41.200 --> 22:42.440]  Why is it a bagel?
[22:43.000 --> 22:44.300]  Because there's a hole in the middle.
[22:44.460 --> 22:52.040]  I think it's just like more of a doughnut.
[22:52.340 --> 22:53.760]  What's the what's the like?
[22:53.940 --> 22:57.280]  I would say a pineapple ring is more bagel to doughnut.
[22:57.420 --> 23:01.800]  Would you call it a pineagle or a that an apple?
[23:05.360 --> 23:06.440]  Kind of thing.
[23:06.560 --> 23:08.060]  Why don't why don't we go to the Internet?
[23:08.240 --> 23:08.960]  We'll put a poll.
[23:09.160 --> 23:12.900]  Is a pineapple ring a fruit bagel or a fruit?
[23:13.360 --> 23:19.160]  Mmm, I think it should just say what is a pineapple and then it could you could just
[23:19.160 --> 23:20.580]  put a bagel or a doughnut.
[23:20.620 --> 23:25.240]  I don't think you need to explain anything about what you're trying to get about.
[23:25.480 --> 23:27.800]  You just ask people if it's a bagel or a doughnut.
[23:28.640 --> 23:31.160]  I mean, it's pretty sweet.
[23:31.260 --> 23:32.080]  I would think it'd be.
[23:32.320 --> 23:33.880]  It would be so sticky on the fingers.
[23:34.020 --> 23:34.640]  I hate it.
[23:34.820 --> 23:35.660]  Hey, we want to do.
[23:35.740 --> 23:39.160]  Gav, do you want to make one tomorrow when we're making the potagel?
[23:39.580 --> 23:40.380]  I think I do.
[23:40.380 --> 23:43.660]  And I think the way we finish it will determine what it is.
[23:43.720 --> 23:45.740]  Like if you dunk the whole thing in chocolate, that's a doughnut.
[23:46.220 --> 23:47.560]  But if I put on like.
[23:49.120 --> 23:50.040]  Strips of.
[23:50.680 --> 23:52.200]  What's a strippable fruit?
[23:54.100 --> 23:54.940]  Uh, orange?
[23:55.320 --> 23:55.800]  Most fruit.
[23:56.300 --> 23:56.500]  Banana.
[23:57.460 --> 23:57.860]  Yeah.
[23:58.240 --> 24:02.740]  If I like put that on top, like open face to the pineapple, that's more of a bagel.
[24:03.060 --> 24:08.700]  OK, I'm going to open a 30 minute poll on the regulation podcast Twitter account.
[24:09.520 --> 24:11.020]  I am. It's 30 minutes.
[24:11.920 --> 24:14.400]  The question is, what is a pineapple choice?
[24:14.500 --> 24:16.040]  One bagel choice to doughnut.
[24:16.140 --> 24:17.780]  Is there anything I need to change about that?
[24:18.480 --> 24:19.600]  I don't think so.
[24:19.700 --> 24:20.760]  OK, it's posted.
[24:21.500 --> 24:22.260]  There you go.
[24:22.340 --> 24:25.000]  We'll check in in 30 minutes and see what you.
[24:26.080 --> 24:26.800]  I will say.
[24:26.980 --> 24:31.200]  What is a pineapple bagel or doughnut?
[24:31.580 --> 24:33.680]  Not to completely leave the pineapple.
[24:33.860 --> 24:36.860]  I too put out a poll last week, I believe.
[24:37.040 --> 24:37.480]  Uh huh.
[24:37.480 --> 24:41.080]  Trying to determine who's more of a bat guy, Bruce Wayne or Batman.
[24:41.380 --> 24:41.960]  Saw that.
[24:42.540 --> 24:43.620]  I was wrong.
[24:45.240 --> 24:47.900]  But it was a lot closer than I would have thought.
[24:48.020 --> 24:49.500]  Like, I kind of felt I was wrong.
[24:49.860 --> 24:54.300]  A lot of people bringing up a great point that Bruce Wayne was actually traumatized by bats
[24:54.300 --> 24:56.240]  and is definitely not a fan.
[24:56.600 --> 24:58.260]  That's what I said in the in the episode.
[24:58.820 --> 25:00.140]  Yeah, listen, I missed it.
[25:00.160 --> 25:02.520]  I was having a bad day when we recorded those.
[25:03.440 --> 25:04.460]  Just didn't hear it.
[25:04.580 --> 25:05.600]  He was having a bad day.
[25:07.720 --> 25:08.880]  Are you having a better day today?
[25:09.200 --> 25:10.700]  I'm having a way better day today.
[25:10.740 --> 25:12.780]  We're talking about pineapple rings and doughnuts.
[25:12.900 --> 25:13.560]  This is fucking great.
[25:14.240 --> 25:16.740]  Hey, so I'm gonna put together a shopping list for tomorrow.
[25:16.920 --> 25:20.160]  I have on it pineapple, potato, bagel.
[25:20.640 --> 25:21.900]  Is there anything else I need to get?
[25:22.540 --> 25:24.780]  Well, we've got we need dogs and string.
[25:25.380 --> 25:26.280]  Dogs and string.
[25:26.420 --> 25:27.980]  We're not going to wait for papaya dogs.
[25:28.460 --> 25:29.820]  Dogs and string.
[25:30.000 --> 25:30.640]  I might have string.
[25:30.900 --> 25:33.600]  And I think this is a conversation from our meeting on Monday,
[25:33.640 --> 25:36.640]  but I had the urge to film a live action bit
[25:36.640 --> 25:41.440]  where instead of doing the water bottle hanging from the fan ceiling fan challenge,
[25:41.500 --> 25:44.120]  I thought maybe we could tie two dogs to a ceiling fan
[25:44.120 --> 25:47.980]  and then two people have to blindfold eat a dog.
[25:48.360 --> 25:49.360]  It's a great idea.
[25:52.120 --> 25:55.820]  It's like, you know, that trend where people put blindfolds on
[25:55.820 --> 25:57.520]  and try to dodge the water bottles.
[25:57.960 --> 26:00.620]  It's like the reverse of that where you're blindfolded,
[26:00.680 --> 26:02.620]  but you still have you're trying to eat the dogs.
[26:02.920 --> 26:04.520]  You're trying to catch what's coming at you.
[26:04.520 --> 26:09.040]  At what point in the friendship did you stop listening to anything Gavin says?
[26:09.060 --> 26:10.600]  It's just like I'm stunned.
[26:10.800 --> 26:12.180]  I'm like stunned.
[26:12.900 --> 26:13.940]  I don't know what's happened.
[26:14.020 --> 26:15.180]  I thought I was crazy.
[26:15.380 --> 26:15.920]  Thank God.
[26:16.080 --> 26:16.400]  What do you mean?
[26:17.100 --> 26:18.060]  Are you not doing a bit?
[26:18.260 --> 26:22.720]  He just fucking said it's like the water bottle thing, but he was describing it.
[26:23.040 --> 26:24.060]  No, you weren't kidding.
[26:24.320 --> 26:27.780]  I just thought I was waiting you out because you were doing a...
[26:27.780 --> 26:28.560]  Are you serious?
[26:29.220 --> 26:30.340]  I just didn't hear it.
[26:30.420 --> 26:30.880]  That's crazy.
[26:31.320 --> 26:32.580]  But you're replying to me.
[26:32.620 --> 26:34.200]  And that's that's what I just said.
[26:35.060 --> 26:35.980]  I don't know.
[26:36.080 --> 26:37.660]  Who are you talking to?
[26:38.100 --> 26:38.500]  Hello?
[26:39.400 --> 26:40.780]  I'm running through the mountains of GTA.
[26:40.920 --> 26:41.940]  I got to put this controller down.
[26:42.080 --> 26:42.660]  This is...
[26:42.660 --> 26:44.260]  Wait, are you playing a video game?
[26:44.500 --> 26:45.580]  No, Cougar.
[26:45.740 --> 26:46.920]  I got to eat my Cougar.
[26:47.080 --> 26:48.620]  Oh, come on.
[26:48.980 --> 26:50.280]  Andrew, do the podcast.
[26:51.600 --> 26:52.420]  I'm fully focused.
[26:52.580 --> 26:53.220]  I'm fully locked in.
[26:53.420 --> 26:53.620]  Sorry.
[26:53.740 --> 26:54.160]  No, you're not.
[26:54.160 --> 26:55.160]  They added snow to GTA.
[26:55.300 --> 26:58.060]  I was just checking something because we're, you know, mini heists.
[26:58.060 --> 27:00.160]  I'd love to film something with you guys.
[27:00.640 --> 27:01.240]  It's been fun.
[27:01.540 --> 27:02.320]  I'm blown away.
[27:02.380 --> 27:02.960]  That wasn't a bit.
[27:03.640 --> 27:04.040]  No.
[27:04.040 --> 27:05.440]  I was nuts.
[27:05.700 --> 27:06.300]  I will.
[27:06.540 --> 27:09.380]  Could you please clip that and send it to like play a next episode?
[27:09.460 --> 27:11.600]  Because I that that was I missed it.
[27:11.840 --> 27:13.380]  I want to know how bad that was.
[27:14.240 --> 27:17.520]  It was so bad that I didn't react to it because I just thought it was funny.
[27:18.180 --> 27:20.880]  I thought I thought I was going nuts.
[27:21.060 --> 27:24.300]  I thought that I'm like, well, maybe he didn't say it.
[27:24.360 --> 27:25.940]  And then, oh, thank God for Jeff.
[27:26.120 --> 27:26.540]  Wow.
[27:28.340 --> 27:29.220]  Oh, man.
[27:29.780 --> 27:30.140]  Wow.
[27:30.620 --> 27:31.140]  Yeah, that was strange.
[27:31.240 --> 27:32.600]  I thought you were having a better day today.
[27:32.920 --> 27:33.780]  I'm having a great day.
[27:34.040 --> 27:35.520]  I mean, having to like.
[27:36.200 --> 27:40.440]  He's doing his job and then just playing a video game at the same time.
[27:40.520 --> 27:41.540]  Really locked in.
[27:41.700 --> 27:44.280]  I was checking to see something relating to work.
[27:44.460 --> 27:48.980]  Am I not only did you repeat the thing that I had just said?
[27:49.120 --> 27:53.780]  It was right after me talking about you not listening to me.
[27:54.940 --> 27:57.560]  I didn't listen last time.
[27:57.860 --> 27:58.280]  No, you listened.
[27:58.500 --> 27:59.180]  I was in a bad.
[27:59.980 --> 28:01.240]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[28:01.540 --> 28:01.780]  That's good.
[28:02.820 --> 28:04.480]  I'm not even going to say anything else after that.
[28:04.500 --> 28:04.800]  You're right.
[28:06.080 --> 28:07.040]  I need to be.
[28:07.580 --> 28:08.640]  Listen, man in the mirror.
[28:09.640 --> 28:10.160]  That's me.
[28:10.480 --> 28:11.300]  I know I did.
[28:11.380 --> 28:12.540]  I'm saying it to me in the mirror.
[28:12.640 --> 28:12.840]  Listen.
[28:14.660 --> 28:16.080]  I need to listen more.
[28:18.500 --> 28:20.460]  In my defense, I have none.
[28:21.040 --> 28:21.600]  That was bad.
[28:23.260 --> 28:24.260]  I should have.
[28:25.280 --> 28:25.820]  I don't know.
[28:25.860 --> 28:28.940]  It's weird to have committed a crime that you're not even aware you did.
[28:28.940 --> 28:33.800]  Like, I have zero awareness of how bad it was of what you said.
[28:33.820 --> 28:34.320]  I can't wait.
[28:34.480 --> 28:35.480]  I can't wait to hear it.
[28:38.580 --> 28:39.700]  Oh, my God.
[28:39.720 --> 28:40.940]  Is that the first time that's happened?
[28:41.040 --> 28:43.300]  I feel like this has happened before, but with you to me.
[28:43.920 --> 28:45.940]  Uh, I mean, I've definitely been guilty of it.
[28:45.980 --> 28:50.720]  I just feel like not within the same 20 seconds that the thing's being said.
[28:50.880 --> 28:54.360]  The reply to the thing being the exact same thing that was just said.
[28:55.000 --> 28:55.240]  Yeah.
[28:56.120 --> 28:57.160]  How's the poll going?
[28:59.360 --> 29:03.240]  Well, it's been it's been five minutes.
[29:03.600 --> 29:04.940]  Yeah, just, you know, what's an update?
[29:05.460 --> 29:05.940]  Okay.
[29:06.140 --> 29:08.220]  It's 71% to 28%.
[29:08.800 --> 29:11.000]  So 71.4, 28.6.
[29:11.120 --> 29:12.180]  What do you think is leading?
[29:13.660 --> 29:15.800]  Uh, I think Donut's leading.
[29:16.080 --> 29:16.420]  Okay.
[29:16.500 --> 29:16.860]  Gavin?
[29:17.780 --> 29:18.740]  Uh, yeah, I agree.
[29:19.100 --> 29:19.440]  Okay.
[29:19.520 --> 29:19.880]  Jeff?
[29:21.300 --> 29:25.560]  And Donut makes the most sense, but it's our audience and they already know about bagels.
[29:25.640 --> 29:27.100]  So I'm going to I'm going to say bagel.
[29:27.620 --> 29:28.600]  Yeah, it's Donut.
[29:29.420 --> 29:30.540]  Well, good, good.
[29:30.640 --> 29:30.760]  Yeah.
[29:31.720 --> 29:34.100]  It should it should be Donut.
[29:34.180 --> 29:34.320]  Yeah.
[29:34.420 --> 29:34.620]  Yeah.
[29:34.660 --> 29:36.760]  I mean, by a landslide right now, it's huge.
[29:37.360 --> 29:39.380]  Can we make a pineapple donut?
[29:39.560 --> 29:41.500]  Like dunk a pineapple ring in chocolate tomorrow?
[29:42.240 --> 29:43.100]  Well, let me get some.
[29:43.160 --> 29:44.720]  So we're going to need like melted chocolate.
[29:45.360 --> 29:45.720]  Yeah.
[29:45.820 --> 29:46.620]  Well, we can melt it.
[29:46.700 --> 29:48.500]  We don't have to melt it ourselves, but yeah.
[29:48.960 --> 29:49.900]  Well, how are you going to buy it melted?
[29:50.020 --> 29:51.180]  You're not going to go to the chocolate store and say,
[29:51.240 --> 29:54.260]  give me a gallon of melted chocolate and give it to me hot.
[29:54.760 --> 29:55.360]  Yeah, that's what I said.
[29:55.740 --> 29:57.740]  I'll get melting chocolate and melt it.
[29:59.480 --> 30:02.980]  You just give them a bag of like chocolate chips and be like,
[30:03.100 --> 30:04.120]  can you melt this for me?
[30:04.440 --> 30:06.220]  Can I get this in liquid form, please?
[30:06.640 --> 30:08.880]  But why do you have to buy melted chocolate melts?
[30:09.300 --> 30:12.520]  There's special chocolate that's designed to be melted for fucking
[30:13.420 --> 30:14.800]  desserts like this you can buy.
[30:14.900 --> 30:18.180]  It comes in disks that you do melt.
[30:21.780 --> 30:23.660]  It's like other than just like
[30:23.660 --> 30:26.260]  getting a bar of Hershey's and throwing it in a pot,
[30:26.320 --> 30:27.780]  you can just buy the melting chocolate.
[30:27.780 --> 30:29.080]  Yeah, I just what's the point?
[30:29.980 --> 30:32.020]  What's the point of the more meltable chocolate?
[30:32.180 --> 30:33.520]  It's like buying chopping apples.
[30:33.980 --> 30:38.220]  How do you feel about like wood that is designed to be burnt like firewood?
[30:39.820 --> 30:40.220]  Designed?
[30:40.300 --> 30:41.200]  Well, you know what I mean?
[30:41.280 --> 30:42.100]  Like fireplace logs.
[30:43.380 --> 30:43.620]  Yeah.
[30:44.080 --> 30:45.260]  You fan of the fireplace log?
[30:45.300 --> 30:47.600]  Or do you think that's also pointless because there's trees everywhere?
[30:48.540 --> 30:52.560]  Well, isn't that for people who don't have lots of wood access to trees?
[30:53.620 --> 30:55.520]  I mean, you can get branches wherever you go.
[30:56.100 --> 30:58.640]  Walk in the woods, go find some.
[31:00.300 --> 31:02.560]  Are branches free?
[31:05.860 --> 31:07.740]  Listen, I don't have a lot of money.
[31:07.820 --> 31:10.380]  I can't buy this Christmas tree, but I'll take four branches.
[31:10.700 --> 31:11.380]  How much is that?
[31:12.020 --> 31:16.160]  Like if there's a branch that's fallen off a tree on the ground out in the world.
[31:16.720 --> 31:17.240]  Is that free?
[31:17.480 --> 31:18.900]  Is it on public or private land?
[31:19.680 --> 31:19.920]  Public.
[31:20.340 --> 31:20.840]  That's free?
[31:21.280 --> 31:23.340]  Yeah, ask, ask any dog.
[31:26.600 --> 31:29.540]  But if it's on the tree still, not free.
[31:30.100 --> 31:31.520]  Well, it depends on who's around.
[31:35.400 --> 31:37.120]  How bad do you want this branch?
[31:37.720 --> 31:38.500]  I gotta keep warm.
[31:42.400 --> 31:43.200]  This is...
[31:43.200 --> 31:45.920]  You're scavenging for life in this scenario?
[31:46.780 --> 31:47.740]  What is going on?
[31:47.980 --> 31:52.380]  If it's a keep warm or die type situation, which is what you're framing,
[31:52.800 --> 31:55.460]  I don't know that I'd give a shit if it was somebody else's branch or not.
[31:55.460 --> 31:57.860]  I think at that point it's the life-saving branch.
[31:59.680 --> 32:02.660]  I don't think Gavin could make a fire in the wild.
[32:03.920 --> 32:05.220]  Oh my god, dude.
[32:05.560 --> 32:05.660]  Wow.
[32:06.020 --> 32:07.520]  Emily asked me for...
[32:07.520 --> 32:09.960]  Last night we were watching the season finale of Survivor,
[32:10.040 --> 32:14.980]  which by the way, one of the better seasons of Survivor I've seen in a long time.
[32:16.040 --> 32:18.280]  Really phenomenally strong ending.
[32:18.860 --> 32:22.960]  And Emily was saying that for her birthday, she wants to make fire like Survivor
[32:23.460 --> 32:25.280]  in the exact same way and see if she can do it.
[32:25.280 --> 32:28.680]  Maybe we should have a Survivor fire-burning or fire-making contest.
[32:29.540 --> 32:29.980]  Yeah.
[32:30.400 --> 32:31.800]  I feel like I could make fire.
[32:32.120 --> 32:33.820]  Could you burn the string before I could?
[32:34.480 --> 32:34.640]  Yeah.
[32:34.640 --> 32:37.240]  I'm putting money on Jeff 100% of the way.
[32:37.400 --> 32:38.500]  No way.
[32:38.900 --> 32:40.600]  No way you're faster than Jeff.
[32:41.380 --> 32:44.500]  So can we set up four stations with the string and everything?
[32:45.000 --> 32:45.220]  Yeah.
[32:45.540 --> 32:47.340]  We just got to get all the tools.
[32:47.900 --> 32:48.540]  So what do we get?
[32:48.600 --> 32:49.440]  We get a...
[32:49.440 --> 32:50.620]  Get like a Rambo knife.
[32:50.720 --> 32:51.660]  Get like four Rambo knives.
[32:51.760 --> 32:53.060]  A little flint and steel thing.
[32:54.000 --> 32:54.880]  What do they call it?
[32:55.240 --> 32:56.460]  Chaff or whatever that...
[32:57.200 --> 32:57.520]  Yeah.
[32:58.640 --> 32:59.900]  And then a bunch of tinder.
[33:00.040 --> 33:01.900]  And then you just like build it up.
[33:02.000 --> 33:05.040]  Oh, and then we have to get the string and make a little thing with the flag.
[33:05.340 --> 33:05.680]  We can do that.
[33:05.900 --> 33:10.600]  And then Gavin's got to go to a park that's on public land to get a bunch of twigs and branches.
[33:11.180 --> 33:12.100]  Did you say kindering?
[33:12.600 --> 33:13.400]  No, I said tindering.
[33:14.040 --> 33:14.360]  Tindering?
[33:14.960 --> 33:15.240]  Yeah.
[33:16.200 --> 33:16.820]  For fires.
[33:19.280 --> 33:20.060]  Kindling and tinder?
[33:20.060 --> 33:24.460]  Well, yeah, when you go on tinder and you're trying to set it on fire.
[33:24.780 --> 33:28.080]  You're swiping so fast that you're trying to start the fire.
[33:28.540 --> 33:33.120]  Hey, tindering, is that not the phrase?
[33:33.780 --> 33:36.060]  Tinder's like what you'd like to start the kindling, right?
[33:37.500 --> 33:39.780]  Tinder is a word and kindling is a word.
[33:39.900 --> 33:41.440]  I don't know that tindering is a word.
[33:41.820 --> 33:45.660]  I like that you were saying tindering and I thought you were saying kindering,
[33:46.560 --> 33:49.360]  which I think would be German for like childing.
[33:52.700 --> 33:54.480]  Are we sure about this?
[33:55.780 --> 33:57.080]  Sure about what?
[33:57.980 --> 33:59.520]  Tindering not being a thing.
[33:59.880 --> 34:01.660]  Well, tindering is how I met Emily.
[34:05.860 --> 34:07.020]  I'm going to install that.
[34:07.160 --> 34:10.400]  I've been playing the long dark recently, which is a survival game.
[34:10.400 --> 34:13.640]  And where you got to collect stuff or you make fires and that type of thing.
[34:13.680 --> 34:16.980]  I could have swore I probably combined the two words like you're saying.
[34:17.060 --> 34:19.780]  That's almost guaranteed, but I'm redownloading it.
[34:19.780 --> 34:22.000]  Just to check if that's a word.
[34:22.240 --> 34:25.780]  So you're just back on that console splitting that attention.
[34:26.360 --> 34:29.180]  Well, I just I queued up to download the long dark.
[34:29.280 --> 34:33.520]  In his defense, if I if my computer worked, I'd be playing prop hunt right now.
[34:35.080 --> 34:37.800]  Does everyone do other shit while they're making the podcast?
[34:37.800 --> 34:39.660]  I don't. I'm doing this podcast.
[34:39.660 --> 34:41.640]  I'm logged in doing this podcast.
[34:41.940 --> 34:41.980]  Never.
[34:42.160 --> 34:44.820]  All I do is I'll be honest with you, dude.
[34:44.860 --> 34:46.760]  I don't even have my eyes open for most of the podcast.
[34:46.760 --> 34:49.920]  I sit here in front of the mic with my eyes closed and look forward.
[34:50.200 --> 34:52.720]  I just realized right now my eyes are dead ass closed.
[34:53.580 --> 34:53.900]  Yeah, I do.
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.840]  Every once in a while I open to look at the waveform and make sure it's still there
[34:56.840 --> 34:59.680]  or see if anybody posted and then I'm back to closed eyes.
[35:00.140 --> 35:01.780]  That's why I got eaten by that cougar in GTA.
[35:01.880 --> 35:02.620]  My eyes were closed.
[35:03.260 --> 35:04.100]  I was so focused.
[35:04.320 --> 35:05.620]  Yes, this episode.
[35:05.780 --> 35:06.540]  This is a three out of ten.
[35:06.580 --> 35:07.780]  This might be a two out of ten, guys.
[35:07.900 --> 35:09.920]  This is a we got to we got to lock in here.
[35:09.960 --> 35:11.640]  We got to we got to pull this one out of the dumpster.
[35:11.960 --> 35:13.100]  We got to get it.
[35:13.140 --> 35:16.100]  It might be catching on fire with all the tindling or whatever.
[35:16.100 --> 35:17.120]  This is not good.
[35:18.320 --> 35:22.920]  So as of the day this comes out, it's 2025.
[35:23.640 --> 35:23.960]  Correct.
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.560]  And who's who's watching Q1?
[35:29.200 --> 35:31.180]  Oh, yeah, that's true.
[35:31.360 --> 35:38.460]  I can I can be on lookout in Q1 if that's what we need.
[35:38.920 --> 35:40.300]  I'll take I can.
[35:40.400 --> 35:42.420]  I don't mind taking the first watch if that's the case.
[35:42.420 --> 35:46.720]  I'm terrified because I don't want to repeat what I did with Gavin earlier,
[35:46.720 --> 35:52.080]  but I keep meaning to bring up I had an idea for the Nick mask game,
[35:52.200 --> 35:55.900]  and I'm now I'm so nervous that we've already been over this
[35:55.900 --> 35:57.940]  and that we're all talking about the same thing.
[35:58.160 --> 35:59.420]  What? OK, what is it?
[35:59.720 --> 36:03.760]  Instead of doing because we have always done where we swap out
[36:03.760 --> 36:05.620]  and Nick only has to wear the mask once.
[36:06.000 --> 36:09.380]  What if Nick has to try to wear the mask four different times
[36:09.380 --> 36:11.900]  and we're each on different sets of months?
[36:12.420 --> 36:15.060]  He has to wear the mask for in four quarters.
[36:15.500 --> 36:18.020]  Yes. So let's say Eric starts.
[36:18.180 --> 36:22.020]  He is the first three months of the year. Nick has three months to do it.
[36:23.680 --> 36:27.360]  And instead of Nick just passing through once and theoretically,
[36:27.360 --> 36:29.630]  one of us never even needing to be on guard.
[36:30.240 --> 36:32.480]  That's but that's what I like about it.
[36:32.620 --> 36:36.760]  Yeah, I mean, that's like that's only 12 episodes to cover.
[36:36.900 --> 36:41.640]  That's I mean, to me, the excitement is I'm going to be on guard
[36:41.640 --> 36:47.480]  until March 31st and then my watch is over and it's somebody else's problem now.
[36:47.560 --> 36:49.620]  And there's so much writing on it.
[36:49.700 --> 36:51.860]  Well, we should clarify your watch isn't over.
[36:52.060 --> 36:53.060]  It's just you're heightened.
[36:53.340 --> 36:54.640]  You're everyone's on watch.
[36:55.040 --> 36:56.380]  OK, OK.
[36:56.920 --> 36:57.560]  Speak for yourself.
[36:58.140 --> 37:02.140]  Yeah, Jeff's eyes are closed. Andrew's playing Grand Theft Auto.
[37:02.680 --> 37:02.980]  All right.
[37:03.280 --> 37:04.740]  Maybe someone watching harder than others.
[37:05.580 --> 37:06.060]  I don't know.
[37:06.080 --> 37:09.700]  I like the idea of it being a one time event in an entire year.
[37:10.020 --> 37:10.720]  Me too. That's fine.
[37:10.720 --> 37:11.940]  I do. I do like that.
[37:12.020 --> 37:14.660]  I was trying to balance it out a little bit because we're like 0 and 3.
[37:15.340 --> 37:20.480]  It would just be insane that it's like so early on that he would do it because then
[37:20.480 --> 37:21.900]  the rest of the year, the thing's blown.
[37:22.060 --> 37:23.720]  But at the same time, what a move.
[37:24.140 --> 37:26.300]  Yeah, I think it would have been a smart move to do it today.
[37:26.800 --> 37:27.060]  Yeah.
[37:30.260 --> 37:33.160]  That being said, I bet I could have snuck it past you every quarter.
[37:33.500 --> 37:34.200]  Oh, absolutely.
[37:34.300 --> 37:38.000]  I mean, if you're confident enough to do it, you could you could increase it.
[37:38.000 --> 37:42.040]  I mean, if if if it's the case where we're trying to call it out
[37:42.040 --> 37:45.820]  and you want to see how many times you can wear it, that's up to you.
[37:46.100 --> 37:46.780]  You know what I mean?
[37:46.820 --> 37:49.580]  Like we only have one call out each, right?
[37:49.900 --> 37:52.560]  So yeah, and that gives you the ability, Nick.
[37:52.600 --> 37:54.440]  I mean, you can wear it every week.
[37:55.140 --> 37:57.540]  But if if Nick gets it by us.
[37:58.620 --> 38:00.960]  He can choose to do double or double.
[38:02.640 --> 38:04.080]  Where double what?
[38:04.520 --> 38:07.140]  He has to wear two masks at the same time.
[38:07.560 --> 38:09.240]  What the fuck?
[38:09.740 --> 38:10.720]  What the fuck?
[38:10.720 --> 38:12.040]  You're just putting on more mess.
[38:12.380 --> 38:13.680]  Open your eyes and do something.
[38:14.040 --> 38:14.920]  What's going on?
[38:15.100 --> 38:19.100]  If he wants to do the double or double, he can maybe put on the Andrew Balaclava
[38:19.100 --> 38:20.800]  and the monkey mask.
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.060]  And see if he gets that one by us.
[38:24.200 --> 38:25.460]  And if he does, he gets double.
[38:26.980 --> 38:30.780]  It's like that scene in Mission Impossible where he just keeps taking off fake faces.
[38:35.580 --> 38:36.880]  Well, is there a price?
[38:37.140 --> 38:38.100]  Did you?
[38:38.680 --> 38:39.200]  All right, Nick.
[38:40.540 --> 38:42.400]  Nick was so fast to say yes.
[38:42.480 --> 38:42.960]  Sorry, sorry.
[38:42.980 --> 38:44.240]  I was saying, yeah, there should be.
[38:44.320 --> 38:44.820]  There should be.
[38:44.880 --> 38:46.260]  OK, so what's my price?
[38:47.820 --> 38:48.200]  Cake?
[38:49.240 --> 38:49.500]  OK.
[38:50.800 --> 38:51.860]  Was there a price?
[38:52.000 --> 38:53.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[38:53.520 --> 38:55.780]  What if it's a $100 gift card?
[38:56.420 --> 38:59.940]  And if he loses, he has to give us all a $100 gift card.
[39:01.140 --> 39:04.120]  What if it's a $100 gift card?
[39:04.180 --> 39:05.380]  If you lose, there's no penalty.
[39:05.380 --> 39:08.240]  But if you win, it's a $100 gift card.
[39:08.400 --> 39:09.580]  But we get to pick to wear.
[39:10.300 --> 39:12.080]  Oh, I love that now.
[39:12.460 --> 39:13.460]  Now, this is hello.
[39:13.720 --> 39:14.920]  Tractor supply.
[39:17.580 --> 39:19.440]  I do need some lawn feed.
[39:19.540 --> 39:21.560]  Yeah, you get $100 worth, buddy.
[39:21.720 --> 39:22.360]  Oh, yeah.
[39:22.600 --> 39:25.180]  And at that point, if you win $100, you can choose to do the double.
[39:26.380 --> 39:29.920]  You can you can bet your $100 on the double.
[39:30.460 --> 39:33.040]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[39:33.320 --> 39:34.520]  I like that's a good idea.
[39:34.520 --> 39:37.980]  I still I like I, I really do like the idea of us giving away
[39:37.980 --> 39:41.100]  gift certificates to each other, but we don't, but we pick where they go.
[39:42.900 --> 39:43.620]  All right.
[39:43.660 --> 39:46.340]  So that's the 20, 20, 25 game.
[39:46.480 --> 39:50.260]  Nick once again has to sneak a whole episode of wearing the mask past us.
[39:50.320 --> 39:51.760]  And if he wants to go for the double,
[39:52.580 --> 39:55.100]  he can put the balaclava on under the mask and go again.
[39:55.600 --> 39:56.480]  All right.
[39:56.920 --> 39:57.280]  Interesting.
[39:57.440 --> 40:01.260]  And does he have to reveal between the two or can you just go back to back?
[40:01.500 --> 40:04.020]  OK, I think, yeah, I think he would have to reveal.
[40:04.020 --> 40:06.440]  Yeah, he would he would have to reveal if he wore the mask.
[40:06.560 --> 40:06.740]  Yes.
[40:06.860 --> 40:06.980]  Yeah.
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.260]  Usually he pops on at the end of the episode with the camera.
[40:09.500 --> 40:10.880]  Yeah, that's true.
[40:11.140 --> 40:11.920]  Yeah, it's a good point.
[40:12.340 --> 40:13.860]  OK, so Eric's Q1.
[40:14.420 --> 40:15.460]  I like spring.
[40:15.540 --> 40:15.860]  I could go.
[40:15.960 --> 40:16.600]  I could go Q2.
[40:17.120 --> 40:17.760]  I'll do Q3.
[40:18.560 --> 40:19.400]  I'll do Q4.
[40:19.720 --> 40:21.080]  Andrew's heightened in Q4.
[40:21.180 --> 40:21.800]  I like it.
[40:21.840 --> 40:22.240]  All right.
[40:22.500 --> 40:24.860]  OK, I'm locked in, I guess, for this.
[40:24.860 --> 40:29.240]  I'm taking 1st of April to the 30th of June.
[40:31.200 --> 40:31.840]  I'm excited.
[40:32.360 --> 40:33.100]  Good months.
[40:33.100 --> 40:34.200]  Oh, great months.
[40:34.780 --> 40:35.500]  I love Q4.
[40:35.960 --> 40:36.800]  Big Q4 fan.

[41:22.340 --> 41:25.700]  When you said 1st of April, it sounded like you said Vaporal,
[41:25.880 --> 41:30.540]  and I thought for a second that that was a thing, like no mustache November or whatever.
[41:31.620 --> 41:35.020]  Fucking everybody gets together and just vapes hard all April.
[41:36.580 --> 41:41.360]  Dude, that's awesome. Me, you, Chad, James, we're just gonna keep vaping.
[41:43.080 --> 41:45.580]  Stephen Suptic shows up and he's like, remember me?
[41:53.300 --> 41:57.900]  Remember me is the funniest thing you can say. That's great.
[42:00.940 --> 42:04.500]  Could an ass vape? Yes.
[42:04.560 --> 42:08.720]  Yeah, right? I'm sure Will the Farter could vape through his ass.
[42:10.500 --> 42:12.480]  I wonder if you could fart smoke rings.
[42:12.940 --> 42:16.680]  How does a smoke ring work? I don't really know. That's why I asked.
[42:17.120 --> 42:20.840]  I think you like blow it and then you like, I think it has something to do with your tongue.
[42:21.380 --> 42:25.180]  You like blow air through the blow, like blow around your, I don't know,
[42:25.220 --> 42:27.040]  I've never been able to do it. I'm not a smoker though, so I don't know.
[42:27.040 --> 42:30.080]  It'd be make it even extra hard because there's never smoke in my lungs.
[42:30.140 --> 42:33.340]  Yeah, you're just, you're a bottle cap flinging guy. That's your thing.
[42:33.740 --> 42:35.400]  It is. Yeah, I am a bottle cap snapper.
[42:35.640 --> 42:37.340]  Yep. You still snapping caps?
[42:37.880 --> 42:41.220]  I did the other day with Eric and Nick just to see if I could still do it.
[42:41.380 --> 42:44.400]  It was like a four out of 10 snap. Oh no.
[42:44.620 --> 42:48.260]  I did tell him about the time though I snapped one so hard in my kitchen that it bounced off the
[42:48.740 --> 42:52.400]  countertop and went back and hit me in the forehead and stuck into my forehead in front of Gavin.
[42:53.360 --> 42:55.160]  That was maybe one of the best days of my life.
[42:57.960 --> 43:00.920]  If you're going to rank like the top 10 best days of your life,
[43:00.980 --> 43:05.020]  how many of them are Jeff getting hurt due to his own move?
[43:06.100 --> 43:11.280]  Oh, that was such a good one at work that I wasn't even there for. I just watched the video of
[43:11.280 --> 43:14.640]  and I still, I still think about it and laugh.
[43:14.980 --> 43:15.580]  What was it?
[43:16.080 --> 43:20.860]  It was when they, they had that giant inflatable ball and you,
[43:22.220 --> 43:26.620]  I don't know if you climbed on it or tried to jump onto the top of it, but you ended up
[43:27.640 --> 43:32.940]  falling over backwards and doing like a back flip off it and no one ever uploaded it.
[43:34.540 --> 43:34.980]  Really?
[43:35.240 --> 43:36.340]  Never, never came out.
[43:36.540 --> 43:38.980]  I remember getting real fucking hard on that ball one day.
[43:39.720 --> 43:43.940]  There was something that came out with that ball, but then there was a bigger ball
[43:44.540 --> 43:47.200]  and it looked like you, it looked like you broke your neck.
[43:47.400 --> 43:49.780]  Yeah. I remember I landed on my neck. I remember.
[43:53.260 --> 43:56.220]  Let, let me know if someone in the audience has actually seen that.
[43:56.340 --> 43:58.720]  And it just maybe snuck past me.
[43:59.380 --> 44:00.780]  If you have, please link it.
[44:00.920 --> 44:01.560]  I would like to see.
[44:01.720 --> 44:03.100]  Gavin would like to see me hurt again.
[44:03.660 --> 44:09.040]  It's like, I would say maybe a six foot height, like the ball was taller than some people
[44:09.040 --> 44:16.260]  and Jeff was on top and then he falls backwards and just gets flung like a ragdoll onto his head.
[44:18.200 --> 44:19.380]  Ah, the good old days.
[44:19.780 --> 44:20.340]  The good old days.
[44:21.260 --> 44:27.980]  Ever since we talked about the theory that we get enjoyment from seeing people get hurt or fall
[44:27.980 --> 44:32.500]  because it means they're getting eaten by the cougar, it has changed my viewing habits so much
[44:32.500 --> 44:37.120]  or just how I view. I'm just constantly happy about feeling safe. It's great.
[44:39.020 --> 44:42.100]  It's embedded in your fucking genetics, dude.
[44:42.620 --> 44:47.040]  It's just every time, like before, just ah, that guy got hit in the nuts and now it's ah,
[44:47.040 --> 44:48.360]  that guy just got eaten by a cougar.
[44:48.360 --> 44:51.240]  He got, he got fucking velociraptored and I lived.
[44:53.420 --> 44:58.980]  It, cause there was a, I was, I was scrolling and I got a montage of people
[44:58.980 --> 45:02.200]  getting fucked up on Wipeout and I was like, this is the ultimate safety show.
[45:03.580 --> 45:04.760]  Never felt safer.
[45:05.180 --> 45:12.320]  Wipeout with Jon Henson, that one might be some of the best television in the history of TV
[45:12.320 --> 45:16.800]  if you like to see people get hit hard when they're not expecting it.
[45:17.640 --> 45:23.220]  It was like every episode was like a fucking title fight. It was so good.
[45:23.780 --> 45:25.980]  So good for so long. I, man.
[45:26.580 --> 45:27.460]  I would go on that.
[45:28.040 --> 45:28.340]  Yeah.
[45:28.460 --> 45:29.440]  You get people die on that show.
[45:30.080 --> 45:30.400]  Yeah.
[45:31.040 --> 45:31.400]  Jesus.
[45:32.060 --> 45:32.420]  Yeah.
[45:32.720 --> 45:34.320]  Yeah. They just don't air those episodes.
[45:34.780 --> 45:38.080]  I would hope not. Same with Fear Factor. There's a bunch of times people got really
[45:38.080 --> 45:40.820]  fucked up on Fear Factor and they're like, well, sorry to everybody else on this episode.
[45:40.900 --> 45:41.740]  Nobody will ever see it.
[45:42.180 --> 45:45.220]  Wait, isn't Fear Factor like the producers doing shit to people?
[45:45.760 --> 45:49.620]  Yeah. Well, they have to do like to prove a fear as a factor. Sometimes it was like
[45:49.620 --> 45:52.780]  Joe Rogan makes you eat a whale's penis, but other times it was like,
[45:52.820 --> 45:55.240]  you have to jump from this rooftop to another rooftop.
[45:55.560 --> 46:00.360]  I mean, you almost ran me over with one of those hand pump train cart things.
[46:01.520 --> 46:06.340]  I wasn't going to actually run you over. We had a safety string and what happened to it?
[46:06.580 --> 46:07.700]  It broke.
[46:08.560 --> 46:10.160]  We rolled over and we didn't even know.
[46:10.840 --> 46:13.760]  They put like a chain or something over the track so it would stop
[46:14.320 --> 46:16.080]  and they just went straight over it.
[46:21.960 --> 46:28.300]  There's a, you know, Tom Cruise broke his foot in that roof jump in that One Rich Impossible movie.
[46:28.880 --> 46:29.000]  Yeah.
[46:29.300 --> 46:33.360]  It made me, when I watched that movie, you view it after that happened,
[46:33.400 --> 46:35.500]  you view that scene within the context of what happened.
[46:35.980 --> 46:40.460]  And it made me think about, is that the most amount of time between shots
[46:41.020 --> 46:44.480]  where like he jumps and lands on the roof and then he takes like,
[46:44.560 --> 46:47.080]  they cut and he runs like four more steps.
[46:47.540 --> 46:50.680]  And I was thinking it's probably what, like eight months, I'd assume,
[46:51.520 --> 46:55.020]  between him landing on the roof and him moving four feet on the roof.
[46:55.280 --> 46:57.380]  Oh, yeah, probably three or four months at least.
[46:57.580 --> 47:00.640]  I mean, didn't Eraserhead take like several years to shoot?
[47:01.100 --> 47:01.460]  Did it?
[47:01.880 --> 47:05.300]  OK, so Eraserhead was filmed. I'm glad you asked.
[47:05.300 --> 47:11.780]  Eraserhead was filmed in an old, like, horse ranch stables
[47:11.780 --> 47:14.720]  that were owned by the American Film Institute.
[47:15.040 --> 47:21.140]  They, I think they gave David Lynch and those guys the use of it at night.
[47:21.340 --> 47:24.300]  And so they filmed one scene.
[47:24.540 --> 47:26.080]  This is how David Lynch works or worked back then.
[47:26.260 --> 47:30.580]  He filmed one scene a night, and I think it took them four years to film Eraserhead.
[47:30.880 --> 47:31.120]  Oh.
[47:31.340 --> 47:33.640]  Oh, wow. OK, but they consistently filmed.
[47:33.640 --> 47:37.060]  Like, I mean, I assume every night that they could.
[47:37.220 --> 47:38.880]  I don't know that they filmed seven days a week, but yeah,
[47:38.900 --> 47:41.600]  they they shot that thing at night over four years.
[47:41.780 --> 47:44.400]  It took very, very long because he's, you know,
[47:44.420 --> 47:48.600]  David Lynch is such an auteur to the extreme that he builds the furniture.
[47:48.800 --> 47:52.040]  Like if you watch Lost Highway, he built all the furniture in their house
[47:52.040 --> 47:54.980]  because he couldn't find a house that looked right.
[47:55.100 --> 47:57.940]  So he like he's like that precise with stuff.
[47:58.220 --> 47:59.000]  That's wild.
[47:59.000 --> 48:04.780]  So funny you the David Lynch came up because I just he's my my New Year's resolution for 2025.
[48:05.440 --> 48:07.780]  I decided to watch all of his films.
[48:08.100 --> 48:10.140]  No, I was somebody asked me on.
[48:10.300 --> 48:13.340]  So I'll write in an email if I what order they should watch Twin Peaks in.
[48:13.520 --> 48:14.440]  And so I was explaining it.
[48:14.500 --> 48:17.880]  And then I realized I never finished the new Twin Peaks series because
[48:18.940 --> 48:19.960]  we were watching it.
[48:20.000 --> 48:21.980]  And then then I got divorced.
[48:24.420 --> 48:26.360]  And I just never went back to it.
[48:26.380 --> 48:28.500]  You know, it's like I just never thought about it again and moved on.
[48:28.500 --> 48:30.020]  And I realized I never finished it.
[48:30.040 --> 48:31.060]  So I got to go back and watch it.
[48:31.120 --> 48:32.680]  And I feel I feel like a bad David Lynch fan.
[48:32.880 --> 48:33.800]  So that's my New Year's resolution.
[48:33.920 --> 48:37.040]  I'm going to rewatch the new two seasons of Twin Peaks.
[48:37.400 --> 48:41.220]  I feel like I the last episode I watched was Dougie and the Casino.
[48:41.640 --> 48:42.340]  I think so.
[48:42.480 --> 48:43.680]  Yeah, that'd been my last episode, too.
[48:43.680 --> 48:43.900]  Probably.
[48:44.460 --> 48:46.420]  I didn't know they did two seasons when they brought it back.
[48:46.480 --> 48:47.200]  I thought it was just one.
[48:47.500 --> 48:49.620]  I don't know that it was two seasons, but it was split.
[48:49.740 --> 48:51.540]  So there were like nine to nine or something.
[48:52.920 --> 48:55.380]  I think that was a comeback for Matthew Lillard.
[48:56.140 --> 48:57.280]  I think he was in that, wasn't he?
[48:57.280 --> 48:59.480]  He's a fucking dork in it.
[49:00.060 --> 49:01.860]  He's a dork in most things, I would say.
[49:02.760 --> 49:04.040]  Yeah, that's sort of what he does.
[49:04.480 --> 49:05.220]  Except for Scream.
[49:05.680 --> 49:07.240]  You don't think he's a dork in Scream?
[49:08.620 --> 49:10.620]  I think he's a massive dork in Scream.
[49:11.080 --> 49:12.480]  Come on, guys, you're making fun of Nick's hero.
[49:13.620 --> 49:16.220]  Yeah, is it his name like Stew or something?
[49:16.420 --> 49:18.500]  And he just goes like, I'll be right back.
[49:18.980 --> 49:20.960]  It's like, OK, yeah, that's a dork.
[49:23.020 --> 49:24.060]  He's very much a dork.
[49:25.060 --> 49:27.040]  What's your favorite Matthew Lillard movie, Nick?
[49:29.140 --> 49:29.940]  Probably Scream.
[49:30.460 --> 49:30.900]  Scream, OK.
[49:31.420 --> 49:31.940]  Name another one.
[49:32.200 --> 49:33.100]  SLC Punk, right?
[49:33.560 --> 49:33.920]  What, who?
[49:34.000 --> 49:34.720]  Yeah, it's a great movie.
[49:35.180 --> 49:35.380]  Yeah.
[49:35.920 --> 49:36.560]  Oh, I never saw it.
[49:36.780 --> 49:37.320]  Without a paddle?
[49:39.220 --> 49:39.800]  Scooby-Doo.
[49:40.520 --> 49:41.180]  Scooby-Doo 2.
[49:41.400 --> 49:41.660]  Scooby-Doo 2?
[49:41.860 --> 49:42.160]  Yeah.
[49:42.400 --> 49:43.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[49:45.460 --> 49:46.420]  What were you going to say, Jeff?
[49:46.600 --> 49:48.420]  You know, Matt Holm worked on that movie.
[49:49.300 --> 49:49.600]  What?
[49:49.900 --> 49:50.620]  Scooby-Doo 2.
[49:51.000 --> 49:55.160]  He did Scrappy Zilla Wrecks or whatever it was.
[49:55.560 --> 49:56.760]  He worked on that.
[49:56.760 --> 49:58.260]  I hate Scrappy-Doo.
[49:58.700 --> 50:00.220]  Well, fucking blame Matt.
[50:02.760 --> 50:04.960]  Have you ever looked at the Snoopy?
[50:05.060 --> 50:06.380]  I was going to say Snoopy.
[50:06.540 --> 50:08.860]  God, because I've just been so in Snoopy mode with Eric.
[50:09.100 --> 50:10.880]  The Scooby-Doo family tree.
[50:11.700 --> 50:12.560]  It's vast.
[50:12.920 --> 50:14.160]  He's got quite the family tree.
[50:14.580 --> 50:14.840]  Really?
[50:15.480 --> 50:16.340]  Oh, it's huge.
[50:16.420 --> 50:18.000]  Yeah, I mean, I guess I'll have to find a photo.
[50:18.140 --> 50:20.440]  It's the number of Scooby-Doo's.
[50:21.620 --> 50:22.660]  Oh, there we go.
[50:23.240 --> 50:25.280]  Wait, like I wasn't already grabbing it.
[50:25.280 --> 50:27.560]  I'm a big fan of Dooby-Dooby-Doo.
[50:27.920 --> 50:29.140]  Yankee Doodle-Doo.
[50:29.200 --> 50:31.960]  Missing... it all starts with Missing Link-Doo.
[50:33.120 --> 50:35.060]  Then Yankee Doodle-Doo.
[50:35.300 --> 50:38.120]  Then Great Grandpa Scooby, who looks like a ghost.
[50:38.840 --> 50:41.580]  Then Grandpa Scooby, who looks like a younger ghost.
[50:42.280 --> 50:44.440]  Then Dada-Doo and Horton-Doo.
[50:44.480 --> 50:45.460]  Jesus Christ.
[50:45.780 --> 50:46.900]  Yeah, listen, it's vast.
[50:47.000 --> 50:48.160]  There's a lot of Scooby-Doo lore.
[50:48.540 --> 50:49.880]  This looks like a...
[50:49.880 --> 50:50.620]  Mumsy-Doo?
[50:50.920 --> 50:54.020]  It looks like a list of achievement hunters split between the games videos.
[50:56.880 --> 50:59.080]  Like, Flinchy Moony-Doo is in there.
[50:59.760 --> 51:01.400]  There's a Yabba-Doo?
[51:01.660 --> 51:02.840]  You gotta be kidding me.
[51:02.900 --> 51:04.780]  Scooby-Doo's got a brother named Yabba-Doo?
[51:05.500 --> 51:06.960]  That's a Fred Flintstone.
[51:07.620 --> 51:08.400]  Howdy-Doo.
[51:08.980 --> 51:09.900]  Skippy-Doo.
[51:10.500 --> 51:11.540]  Dooby-Dooby-Doo.
[51:12.700 --> 51:14.060]  Dooby-Dooby-Doo is great.
[51:14.580 --> 51:15.520]  Whoopsie-Doo.
[51:15.980 --> 51:16.760]  Whoopsie-Doo.
[51:17.160 --> 51:22.820]  Was Great Grandpa Scooby in the Confederacy?
[51:22.820 --> 51:26.080]  It definitely looks like it with that hat.
[51:27.660 --> 51:29.720]  Is Scooby a plantation pup?
[51:30.540 --> 51:31.700]  He also looks like...
[51:31.700 --> 51:32.440]  I gotta be honest with you.
[51:32.440 --> 51:35.020]  Great Grandpa, he looks like he's looking in this family tree.
[51:35.240 --> 51:39.060]  He looks concerned and he's looking straight down at Dooby-Dooby-Doo.
[51:40.540 --> 51:42.120]  I don't know about you.
[51:42.180 --> 51:43.920]  Great Grandpa Scooby might have...
[51:43.920 --> 51:45.340]  I don't know about this one, man.
[51:45.540 --> 51:46.460]  I don't know, man.
[51:46.540 --> 51:47.440]  Yeah, I don't know.
[51:47.500 --> 51:50.760]  On Scoobypedia, his occupation is listed as soldier.
[51:52.340 --> 51:57.340]  Wait, yeah, but now are there pictures of him wearing blue or pictures of him wearing gray?
[51:57.660 --> 51:58.640]  That's the thing.
[51:58.860 --> 52:00.100]  Is he a ghost the whole time or...
[52:00.100 --> 52:03.260]  Was the father of Grandpa Scooby in a civil war hero?
[52:03.980 --> 52:05.340]  Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.
[52:05.460 --> 52:09.560]  But hero is a loose term, depending on where you're at when you say it.
[52:10.460 --> 52:13.340]  Was Mumsy-Doo named that from birth, do you think?
[52:13.880 --> 52:18.180]  Well, I don't think Dada-Doo was probably named Dada-Doo, I would think.
[52:18.340 --> 52:19.200]  I don't know, maybe not.
[52:19.200 --> 52:21.880]  Grandpa gave birth to Horton and Dada.
[52:24.520 --> 52:28.560]  Well, I mean, do you think Great Grandpa gave birth to Grandpa?
[52:30.060 --> 52:32.420]  He was like, and you shall be Grandpa.
[52:35.040 --> 52:40.360]  And we're all related to Missing Link-Doo, his Christian name.
[52:42.300 --> 52:43.500]  Missing Link-Doo.
[52:44.140 --> 52:44.460]  Eric.
[52:45.040 --> 52:45.280]  Yes.
[52:46.940 --> 52:49.820]  What? How much to get the Missing Link-Doo tattoo?
[52:50.520 --> 52:52.400]  Oh, I would, I think I might get...
[52:52.860 --> 52:56.420]  I'd have to look at what the Missing Link-Doo was from,
[52:56.680 --> 52:59.260]  because it looks like it may be from a pup named Scooby-Doo.
[52:59.360 --> 53:00.280]  And I don't know about that.
[53:00.640 --> 53:01.660]  Pup named Scooby-Doo is good.
[53:01.940 --> 53:07.820]  What if we all agreed to get a member of the Scooby-Doo family that is not Scooby-Doo
[53:07.820 --> 53:08.940]  tattooed in 2024?
[53:08.960 --> 53:12.100]  Oh, God, can it not be from the picture Andrew just sent?
[53:12.540 --> 53:12.720]  Yeah.
[53:13.380 --> 53:14.120]  We can...
[53:14.120 --> 53:16.620]  This TV old ass looking...
[53:16.620 --> 53:17.600]  Oh, this sucks.
[53:18.900 --> 53:21.660]  If I get one, it's the one in the photo.
[53:21.780 --> 53:24.260]  Oh, he's fucking pissed.
[53:25.480 --> 53:26.360]  Which Scooby...
[53:26.360 --> 53:26.480]  All right.
[53:26.520 --> 53:28.600]  First off, I think we should all get one.
[53:28.680 --> 53:31.500]  And I know who I would get based on who I am and my history.
[53:31.680 --> 53:33.260]  Is it the clown hanging upside down?
[53:33.560 --> 53:36.700]  No, I would get fucking Hillbilly Yabba-Doo, because I'm from Alabama.
[53:39.740 --> 53:42.440]  But who do you all most identify with?
[53:42.720 --> 53:45.620]  If you had to be somebody on the Scooby-Doo family tree, who would you be?
[53:46.260 --> 53:47.700]  I guess the one in the top hat.
[53:48.480 --> 53:52.600]  I think I'm Yankee Doodle-Doo.
[53:52.840 --> 53:56.140]  But only in the picture Andrew just sent where he's fucking mad.
[53:57.120 --> 53:57.880]  He's pissed.
[53:58.020 --> 53:59.180]  Why is he pissed?
[54:00.140 --> 54:01.060]  That's a good question.
[54:01.820 --> 54:02.440]  Seems much...
[54:03.040 --> 54:04.580]  I think Nick is scrappy, though.
[54:04.720 --> 54:07.040]  I think I see that you said the other one.
[54:07.140 --> 54:07.800]  I don't know about that.
[54:08.520 --> 54:08.540]  Nah.
[54:09.300 --> 54:10.820]  Nick thinks he's Howdy-Doo.
[54:11.140 --> 54:12.320]  Yeah, you wish you were Howdy-Doo.
[54:12.320 --> 54:14.180]  You're a scrappy if I ever saw it.
[54:14.180 --> 54:15.000]  Nah, fuck scrappy.
[54:15.820 --> 54:18.260]  How many nipples does a dog have?
[54:18.720 --> 54:20.400]  Okay, well, I'm going to mute myself again.
[54:21.340 --> 54:22.040]  They have eight, right?
[54:22.240 --> 54:22.520]  Eight.
[54:22.660 --> 54:23.760]  Eight, I believe, right?
[54:23.920 --> 54:24.140]  Yeah.
[54:24.600 --> 54:24.900]  Is it?
[54:25.280 --> 54:25.640]  Yeah.
[54:26.360 --> 54:26.920]  Yeah, isn't it?
[54:28.040 --> 54:29.920]  I mean, I don't have my dog in front of me, or I'd count them.
[54:31.340 --> 54:31.940]  But why?
[54:32.660 --> 54:35.560]  Just because I got one cat who's always got a nipple out,
[54:35.780 --> 54:38.120]  and I feel like some of my cats have less nipples.
[54:42.300 --> 54:43.960]  When you say nipple out, what do you mean?
[54:44.100 --> 54:44.760]  I just...
[54:44.760 --> 54:46.120]  Like, he's always sat with like...
[54:46.880 --> 54:49.800]  I guess his nipples are balder than some of the other cats,
[54:49.900 --> 54:51.120]  but he's always...
[54:51.120 --> 54:54.580]  And he's quite fat, so his nipples kind of just drag a little bit.
[54:55.180 --> 54:58.880]  Like, he'll sit and a nipple will just be like on top of his foot.
[55:03.290 --> 55:04.350]  I might have to go and count them all.
[55:04.830 --> 55:07.390]  Well, you know, just for a pivot, you know,
[55:07.410 --> 55:10.430]  just to get away from whatever the fuck this is, the results are in.
[55:11.850 --> 55:12.850]  Oh, what are they?
[55:12.930 --> 55:13.550]  What is a pineapple?
[55:14.690 --> 55:15.330]  Uh, it's a donut.
[55:15.890 --> 55:17.030]  Say donut.
[55:17.550 --> 55:17.910]  Wow.
[55:18.370 --> 55:21.130]  All right, let's make this 422 votes.
[55:21.430 --> 55:23.430]  All right, we'll make a pineapple donut tomorrow.
[55:23.850 --> 55:24.810]  Are you gonna get sprinkles?
[55:25.030 --> 55:26.010]  What are you gonna put on it?
[55:26.330 --> 55:27.190]  Well, I feel like...
[55:27.190 --> 55:29.230]  So we'll cut the rings.
[55:29.630 --> 55:29.850]  Sprinkles.
[55:31.790 --> 55:33.130]  Dunk it in Choccy, maybe.
[55:33.290 --> 55:34.210]  Maybe a little bit of powdered...
[55:35.030 --> 55:35.790]  Well, what do we...
[55:36.690 --> 55:37.950]  Should we all bring an ingredient?
[55:37.950 --> 55:41.650]  I mean, everybody's encouraged to bring whatever ingredients you have.
[55:41.770 --> 55:43.350]  Also, if you just want to send me ingredients,
[55:43.450 --> 55:45.770]  I'll go to the store tomorrow morning and buy all this shit.
[55:46.110 --> 55:47.030]  Here's what's on the list.
[55:47.210 --> 55:49.150]  Pineapple, potatoes, bagels.
[55:49.450 --> 55:50.830]  Does anybody have a bagel preference?
[55:50.910 --> 55:52.770]  Should I just get plain bagels?
[55:53.410 --> 55:56.130]  Just get a plain bagel because it's not the star of the show.
[55:56.250 --> 55:58.150]  I think it's just the base for the thing.
[55:59.270 --> 56:01.970]  Dogs and string, melted chocolate,
[56:02.750 --> 56:05.090]  whatever version Gavin approves of, and then sprinkles.
[56:06.590 --> 56:07.390]  Yeah, that's perfect.
[56:07.390 --> 56:09.130]  I think that's probably good.
[56:09.370 --> 56:10.710]  I think that's good.
[56:11.170 --> 56:11.270]  Okay.
[56:11.870 --> 56:16.070]  I saw on TikTok yesterday how to make red licorice.
[56:16.330 --> 56:17.510]  You can make it yourself.
[56:18.070 --> 56:18.290]  Really?
[56:18.290 --> 56:18.750]  How do you make it?
[56:19.110 --> 56:20.130]  It doesn't seem hard.
[56:20.250 --> 56:24.650]  You just boil a bunch of sugar and other stuff,
[56:25.150 --> 56:27.070]  and then put a little red food color in.
[56:27.250 --> 56:27.910]  Should we make that?
[56:28.010 --> 56:31.610]  I don't think we have any attachment to red licorice whatsoever
[56:31.610 --> 56:33.590]  to want to be able to do this.
[56:33.930 --> 56:35.210]  Yeah, there's no point to it.
[56:35.270 --> 56:37.050]  I just remembered that I saw it yesterday.
[56:37.050 --> 56:38.850]  I thought it was crazy that you could do it at home.
[56:39.250 --> 56:40.690]  It seems like something more complicated than that.
[56:40.990 --> 56:43.230]  I mean, if you wanted it as a topping to the donut.
[56:44.630 --> 56:46.070]  Oh, licorice on a donut?
[56:46.510 --> 56:48.710]  Let's figure out a way to crowbar it into a different bit.
[56:49.110 --> 56:49.390]  Okay.
[56:52.660 --> 56:56.820]  You make enough licorice as like a safety string for something against Gavin.
[56:57.300 --> 56:58.040]  Have a break again.
[56:58.620 --> 57:00.700]  Andrew, do you want to make a competing donut tomorrow?
[57:01.200 --> 57:03.120]  Am I going to make a competing donut with an apple?
[57:03.280 --> 57:03.560]  No.
[57:04.840 --> 57:05.240]  Pineapple?
[57:05.880 --> 57:06.280]  No.
[57:06.820 --> 57:08.640]  I'm excited to see you guys in the lab.
[57:08.700 --> 57:11.260]  I got some other lab work I'm working on.
[57:11.260 --> 57:13.420]  I think we got some good stuff.
[57:13.480 --> 57:17.900]  We got the food stuff, but we also have the agility competition tomorrow, I believe.
[57:18.360 --> 57:19.100]  Oh, shit.
[57:19.480 --> 57:20.540]  I'm nervous about it.
[57:20.820 --> 57:21.280]  I'm not.
[57:22.520 --> 57:23.380]  You're good, Nick.
[57:23.400 --> 57:24.040]  You don't need to be nervous.
[57:24.580 --> 57:25.340]  Okay, thank you.
[57:27.120 --> 57:32.220]  You going to try to coat the agility circle with the pineapple juice for slipperyness?
[57:32.480 --> 57:34.660]  Nah, it's a bit sticky, isn't it?
[57:34.700 --> 57:34.960]  Pineapple.
[57:34.960 --> 57:38.760]  I feel like it dries sticky, but at the time it would be kind of slippery.
[57:39.320 --> 57:40.300]  One way to find out.
[57:40.760 --> 57:41.140]  That's okay.
[57:42.000 --> 57:43.660]  I'll get a couple gallons of pineapple juice.
[57:44.060 --> 57:44.760]  Hell yeah.
[57:44.800 --> 57:52.020]  Are we doing one where you guys are just going in normal style and then you do another run
[57:52.020 --> 57:55.100]  where you can do whatever kind of performance enhancement that you bring?
[57:55.540 --> 57:59.100]  A no-peds run and then an any-peds, all-bets-or-off run?
[57:59.300 --> 57:59.640]  Yeah.
[58:00.040 --> 58:00.960]  Is that the plan?
[58:02.200 --> 58:03.740]  Wait, where we can bring anything we want?
[58:04.440 --> 58:07.440]  I would think so. I don't know. Jeff, does that sound right?
[58:07.580 --> 58:11.140]  All right, let's fucking hammer this out because we talked about it in Slack,
[58:11.300 --> 58:13.600]  but I never got confirmation that this is how it was.
[58:14.260 --> 58:17.180]  This is how I understand it from what Gavin was saying last time.
[58:17.240 --> 58:19.840]  Let me know if I got this wrong, but I'd like us all to be on the same page before we film.
[58:20.380 --> 58:23.580]  We're going to stake that motherfucker into the ground.
[58:24.720 --> 58:26.740]  Gavin's going to go through left to right.
[58:26.920 --> 58:27.880]  We're going to mark the time.
[58:28.000 --> 58:29.400]  Then he's going to go through right to left.
[58:29.680 --> 58:31.960]  We're going to mark the time, and then we're going to average that out,
[58:31.980 --> 58:33.100]  and that's going to be Gavin's time.
[58:33.100 --> 58:34.920]  Then we'll do the same thing with Nick.
[58:35.180 --> 58:37.060]  Whoever wins is the fucking champ.
[58:37.440 --> 58:40.260]  Congratulations, Nick. I'm very excited to see it tomorrow.
[58:40.440 --> 58:43.900]  And then after that, we'll have the all-peds competition.
[58:44.100 --> 58:47.180]  If Gavin wants to lube up and then run through it and whatever,
[58:47.500 --> 58:49.280]  then Nick can do whatever it is he wants to do,
[58:49.360 --> 58:54.980]  and then they can have another competition with as many steroids and pine tar as they want.
[58:56.500 --> 59:00.420]  That was my understanding as well, is go through once, go through a second time,
[59:00.420 --> 59:05.800]  average score, and then the second one would be a PED-filled competition.
[59:05.840 --> 59:10.400]  The thing is, I mean, we talked about it before, but if I lube the whole thing,
[59:10.480 --> 59:11.840]  then Nick also gets the lube.
[59:12.620 --> 59:13.940]  Yeah, that's why we're doing that second.
[59:14.100 --> 59:15.460]  Yes, yeah, that's, yeah.
[59:15.720 --> 59:18.840]  So we can flip a coin to see who goes first and second. It's up to you.
[59:19.400 --> 59:21.700]  What if you lined a slip and slide up with it?
[59:22.960 --> 59:26.040]  You slide, you go for the slide with the momentum.
[59:27.040 --> 59:31.760]  You slide down the slip and slide and try to carry through the agility, whatever.
[59:32.280 --> 59:34.920]  You'd come out of that tube like a bullet from a gun.
[59:34.940 --> 59:35.360]  You do.
[59:36.620 --> 59:37.320]  That'd be awesome.
[59:38.300 --> 59:40.400]  What if you slip and slide into the tube?
[59:41.140 --> 59:43.540]  Yeah, what if I line the tube with the slip and slide?
[59:43.940 --> 59:46.280]  Oh, I thought it was on the other end. I'm sorry, I must have misunderstood that.
[59:47.160 --> 59:48.320]  What am I, Andrew here?
[59:48.500 --> 59:49.740]  Yeah, dude, no kidding.
[59:49.880 --> 59:52.940]  I heard what you said, I just inverted it in my brain.
[59:53.320 --> 59:54.160]  Are you playing GTA?
[59:54.720 --> 59:56.880]  No, my eyes are even closed. How can I do this?
[59:59.780 --> 01:00:02.040]  I think Nick will win. Standing by it.
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:03.000]  Sorry, guys.
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:05.860]  Was that four votes for Nick?
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.280]  I think we're all, yeah.
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:08.800]  Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.640]  I mean, I'm excited to see you compete.
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:13.900]  Oh, I'm definitely excited to see Gavin compete.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.540]  Hey, Gav, everybody loves an underdog story.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.380]  So this is a great opportunity for you.
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:22.160]  Prove the world wrong.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.180]  Nah, no Cinderella's here.
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:27.440]  We have to record?
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:29.600]  No Cinderella's here?
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.860]  I got news for you, Cinderella was just a story.
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:39.440]  We're going to put this in the fiction section.
[01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:45.840]  Was it Nick? Nick, were you trying to put in a no shoes rule as well?
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:47.140]  No, that's fine.
[01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:47.700]  What was that, Eric?
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:51.020]  I just think, I was worried that it would tear and then you guys are like,
[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:54.180]  no, it's this special non-tearing fabric.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.280]  And I just said, OK, I mean, if that's what you said.
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:58.300]  To be fair, I think that was Meg that said it wouldn't tear.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.140]  I have no idea if it'll tear or not.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.600]  She seemed very confident, but Meg knows a lot about fabric.
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:08.640]  So if we're going to trust anybody, it should probably be her.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:08.740]  That's true.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.840]  Yeah, but if it's for dogs, they have long nails sometimes.
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.280]  That's a good point.
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.500]  Albert's got little talons.
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:19.020]  We should also see if Albert could beat us.
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:20.900]  Yeah, we should definitely do that.
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.020]  That's a great idea.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:22.940]  I got no problem with that.
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:23.500]  Yeah.
[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:26.060]  Now, is Albert going in lubed or non-lubed?
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:30.860]  I would prefer Albert to go in non-PED so I don't have to give him a bath later.
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:35.500]  I assume it's easier to give Albert a bath than it will be for me to give Gavin a bath.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:36.140]  I've done that before.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.640]  But you did use dog shampoo.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.980]  That was like the fifth best day of Gavin's life.
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:42.400]  Is that right?
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.760]  Yeah, I slipped.
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:45.720]  So it was extra funny.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.480]  What did you hit your head on that time?
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.200]  The towel run.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.460]  Obviously came out of the wall.
[01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:54.260]  It was the whole thing.
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:56.280]  It's we got to record another one of these.
[01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.200]  So next episode, people won't have an update.
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:01.400]  But yeah, I was just about to say we should wrap this up.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:01.580]  Yeah.
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.240]  What what do you what are you jumping into right before we start?
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.460]  My TV is off.
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:06.500]  They don't pay attention to it.
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:07.120]  It's off.
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:08.300]  The monitor's off.
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:11.180]  I was checking something in GTA, as I said, for work.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.760]  And then I got kind of caught in the snowy mountains.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:14.480]  It's nice.
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:19.620]  We should wrap this up and start the next one.
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:20.440]  Well, there you go.
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.580]  Andrew said we should wrap it up.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.440]  So that's what we're going to fucking do.
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:28.600]  Because I listen to Andrew and I pay attention to the things that he says.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:31.160]  And when he speaks, I say, yes, sir.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:31.840]  Andrew, sir.
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.300]  We'll end the episode right now.
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:33.860]  Andrew, sir.
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:35.340]  This is 2025 year.
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:35.920]  What?
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:36.840]  This is 2025.
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:39.980]  Nick, go ahead and fix that in three, two, one.
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:43.120]  This is 2025, the year of Andrew Panton.
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:44.780]  We'll see you next time.
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:45.320]  Bye bye.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:45.920]  Bye.
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:49.300]  Thank God, because this being a dragon year, it was not my year.
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:50.140]  I had to lay low.
