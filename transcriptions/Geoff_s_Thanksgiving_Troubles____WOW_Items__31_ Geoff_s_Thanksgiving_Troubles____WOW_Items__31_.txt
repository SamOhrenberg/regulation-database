[00:30.000 --> 00:36.500]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is episode 31.
[00:36.760 --> 00:42.460]  My name is Jeff Ramsey. With me, as always, Eric Baddour, Andrew Panton, Nick Schwartz,
[00:42.880 --> 00:49.520]  Gavin Free, in no particular order. Hello, boys. Did everybody have a happy Thanksgiving?
[00:50.500 --> 00:52.080]  Yes. It was a day.
[00:54.400 --> 00:55.200]  All right.
[00:55.560 --> 00:57.760]  Well, I don't have... It wasn't my Thanksgiving. It was a day.
[00:57.760 --> 00:58.640]  Right. Sure, sure, sure.
[00:58.960 --> 00:59.360]  Right, right, right, right.
[00:59.360 --> 01:00.040]  It existed.
[01:00.360 --> 01:01.900]  How was your last Thursday, Andrew?
[01:02.420 --> 01:05.960]  It was good. I had a lot of barbecue. I bought barbecue. I ate a bunch of barbecue.
[01:06.860 --> 01:10.200]  Is that because it was other people's Thanksgiving, or you just fancied it for a Thursday?
[01:10.320 --> 01:17.240]  Yeah, like, typically, I don't do turkey on Canadian Thanksgiving than do one on American,
[01:17.420 --> 01:22.200]  because that's when I end up having time off. And I decided, you know, I'm just gonna buy a
[01:22.200 --> 01:26.940]  bunch of barbecue instead. Just skip the turkey entirely. And it was a good decision.
[01:27.440 --> 01:29.380]  You can get turkey in barbecue.
[01:30.220 --> 01:32.240]  That's true, but I didn't.
[01:35.000 --> 01:37.240]  I got a story about skipping turkey.
[01:38.100 --> 01:41.380]  Oh, I'm excited. We have a lot of homework to do as well on this episode.
[01:41.660 --> 01:45.600]  Yeah, what was the... We had homework. Was it signs or potatoes? I can't remember.
[01:45.780 --> 01:47.560]  I believe it was signs and trail mix.
[01:48.200 --> 01:51.140]  Yeah, what was the trail mix? I made signs.
[01:51.540 --> 01:52.320]  Yeah, signs.
[01:52.620 --> 01:53.900]  I made signs and...
[01:54.760 --> 01:59.440]  Yeah, because the calendar invite said sign homework, but it didn't say trail mix homework.
[01:59.680 --> 02:02.620]  I thought it... and I thought it was supposed to be potato homework. I thought we were supposed
[02:02.620 --> 02:04.220]  to be inventing new potato meals.
[02:05.540 --> 02:08.260]  I don't remember anything other than the sign homework.
[02:08.340 --> 02:09.420]  Well, I did it all.
[02:10.660 --> 02:11.620]  Way to go, man.
[02:13.040 --> 02:14.420]  Fucking sucking up to the teacher.
[02:16.080 --> 02:17.640]  We all thought it was different homework.
[02:21.840 --> 02:24.880]  So, can I tell you guys three stories real fast?
[02:24.880 --> 02:25.740]  Of course.
[02:26.140 --> 02:29.360]  Of the three stories that I guess would encapsulate my holiday.
[02:30.100 --> 02:32.600]  The first two are fun. The third one's a little longer.
[02:33.420 --> 02:35.620]  So, Gav, I don't know if you remember, but a couple weeks ago,
[02:36.120 --> 02:39.980]  I was talking to you about how I remembered this turkey we used to order
[02:40.620 --> 02:44.120]  around Thanksgiving and Christmas at Rooster Teeth that we would ship out.
[02:44.200 --> 02:47.540]  It was like a smoked turkey that we would give out to our clients and to the friends
[02:47.540 --> 02:51.180]  of the company. It was like our Christmas gift. It was called a Greenberg smoked turkey.
[02:51.420 --> 02:53.560]  And I got to thinking about it, and I couldn't remember what it was called,
[02:53.560 --> 02:56.000]  so I asked Bernie, and he told me. And then I thought,
[02:56.100 --> 02:58.340]  I'm going to be the fucking coolest dude at Thanksgiving.
[02:59.020 --> 03:02.420]  Because my family and Emily's family and some of our friends,
[03:02.440 --> 03:04.920]  we were all meeting in Branson, Missouri.
[03:06.640 --> 03:09.840]  It's kind of equidistant from where everybody was coming from their homes.
[03:10.000 --> 03:13.040]  And then we rented a big house and went to Silver Dollar City
[03:13.040 --> 03:14.620]  and had a Branson Thanksgiving, right?
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.380]  I thought, I'm going to be the fucking coolest dude in town
[03:18.380 --> 03:21.340]  because I'm going to buy one of these smoked turkeys,
[03:21.340 --> 03:24.600]  and I'm going to bring it with me on the road trip because we're driving up.
[03:25.240 --> 03:31.900]  And so, well in advance, I ordered a 17-pound smoked turkey, which is fucking huge.
[03:31.920 --> 03:33.840]  But I knew there was going to be like 15 people there, right?
[03:34.500 --> 03:36.800]  This isn't a surprise turkey, right?
[03:37.840 --> 03:39.620]  I mean, it would have been a surprise for all of them.
[03:40.780 --> 03:41.760]  Emily and I knew about it.
[03:42.260 --> 03:45.140]  Anyway, I set for it to arrive the day before we left.
[03:45.280 --> 03:47.580]  It arrived, smelled amazing.
[03:48.420 --> 03:51.880]  The instructions say just to keep it refrigerated and it'll keep for 7 to 10 days.
[03:51.980 --> 03:52.460]  So perfect.
[03:52.660 --> 03:54.900]  We had this like refrigerated bag.
[03:54.980 --> 03:57.440]  We stuck it in with a bunch of like, you know,
[03:57.460 --> 03:59.160]  a little like gels and stuff to keep it cool.
[03:59.400 --> 04:01.880]  Threw it in the back of the car, took off on the road trip,
[04:02.340 --> 04:05.020]  decided to break the road trip into two days
[04:05.020 --> 04:07.280]  because we just weren't sure how Albert would do on the road
[04:07.280 --> 04:08.080]  because we took him with us.
[04:08.380 --> 04:11.880]  And so we stayed in Tulsa for the night, rented a hotel,
[04:12.360 --> 04:13.520]  very eventful hotel for Jeff,
[04:13.520 --> 04:17.440]  rented a hotel, a double tree that had a full size fridge in it
[04:17.440 --> 04:19.620]  so that we could store the turkey, right?
[04:20.380 --> 04:23.520]  So we got to the hotel, shoved the turkey in the fridge,
[04:23.580 --> 04:25.480]  looking good, smelling better.
[04:25.720 --> 04:26.940]  Everything is great.
[04:28.640 --> 04:31.580]  At some point in the evening, I'm not feeling well.
[04:31.660 --> 04:32.520]  I'll get into that in a minute.
[04:32.620 --> 04:33.340]  That's the third story.
[04:33.840 --> 04:37.300]  And I lay down, I get, I get naked.
[04:37.340 --> 04:38.340]  I feel bad.
[04:38.440 --> 04:38.900]  I get naked.
[04:38.940 --> 04:40.840]  I get like, I'm the sick.
[04:40.920 --> 04:42.160]  When I'm sick, I get naked.
[04:42.160 --> 04:44.620]  Like, I don't know what it is, but when I like, when I get,
[04:44.680 --> 04:46.540]  when I don't feel well, I get rid of it.
[04:46.580 --> 04:48.920]  It's the only time I ever want to be naked is in a shower
[04:48.920 --> 04:50.640]  or when I'm sick in bed.
[04:51.060 --> 04:53.800]  Usually I sleep in, you know, pajamas or underwear or whatever.
[04:53.960 --> 04:55.260]  And so I'm totally naked.
[04:55.260 --> 04:58.100]  And I'm just like clutching myself in a fetal position in the bed,
[04:58.180 --> 04:59.840]  kind of whining and feeling sorry for myself.
[05:01.080 --> 05:03.300]  And Emily goes to take a shower, you know,
[05:03.320 --> 05:04.060]  because we've been driving all day.
[05:04.480 --> 05:08.920]  And she asks me to order an additional blanket for the bed
[05:08.920 --> 05:12.200]  because the hotel blanket's really thin and it's never enough.
[05:12.320 --> 05:15.340]  And so I order a blanket and she was like,
[05:15.400 --> 05:16.320]  hey, I'm going to hop in the shower.
[05:16.420 --> 05:17.920]  If it comes, will you get the front door?
[05:17.980 --> 05:18.980]  And I'm like, yeah, no worries, man.
[05:19.420 --> 05:21.540]  And so I'm laying in bed and sure enough,
[05:21.620 --> 05:23.460]  somebody knocks on the door while she's in the shower.
[05:23.620 --> 05:24.820]  And so I jump up to get it.
[05:24.820 --> 05:26.520]  And the only thing I see is her bathrobe.
[05:26.800 --> 05:29.600]  So I throw her bathrobe around me, a woman's bathrobe,
[05:29.680 --> 05:32.740]  and I open up the door and the guy hands me the thing.
[05:32.780 --> 05:33.620]  And I'm like, no problem.
[05:33.800 --> 05:36.760]  And as I'm pulling the blanket in, he turns around and leave.
[05:36.760 --> 05:39.460]  Albert shoots out the door like Adam.
[05:39.740 --> 05:41.180]  I go, oh, fuck.
[05:41.320 --> 05:43.540]  So I jump out after him.
[05:43.620 --> 05:45.080]  I grab Albert by the harness.
[05:45.320 --> 05:46.320]  He's not attacking or anything.
[05:46.380 --> 05:47.740]  He's just trying to get out and he's excited.
[05:48.440 --> 05:49.360]  And I'm grabbing.
[05:49.440 --> 05:50.460]  The guy turns around and looks at me.
[05:50.520 --> 05:51.400]  I'm in a bathrobe.
[05:51.960 --> 05:55.300]  I've got a blanket he just gave me in one hand and a bulldog in the other.
[05:55.400 --> 05:57.560]  And I'm like, uh, and he just looks at me like I'm an idiot
[05:57.560 --> 05:59.140]  and just keeps walking, turns the corner.
[05:59.320 --> 06:02.680]  And then, and I'm like, and like that second, the door shuts.
[06:02.780 --> 06:04.140]  And I go, oh, fuck.
[06:05.040 --> 06:05.680]  Oh, fuck.
[06:06.860 --> 06:07.640]  I've got this.
[06:07.800 --> 06:09.060]  I've got a riled up bulldog.
[06:09.260 --> 06:12.840]  I'm naked, except for this half open woman's bathrobe.
[06:13.240 --> 06:15.220]  And I'm locked out of the room now.
[06:15.380 --> 06:17.160]  And Emily's taking a shower.
[06:17.340 --> 06:20.720]  And end of the day, I've been on the road for eight hours.
[06:21.000 --> 06:21.900]  I'm exhausted.
[06:22.120 --> 06:25.480]  Let me just fucking unwind a little bit in the shower, shower.
[06:26.000 --> 06:30.280]  And so Albert and I spent about 12 minutes just sitting on the ground,
[06:30.740 --> 06:34.900]  hiding my genitals with the blanket while I waited for her to get out of the shower.
[06:34.900 --> 06:36.220]  And hear the knocks.
[06:36.640 --> 06:38.800]  And then she opens the door, she's like, what the fuck are you doing?
[06:39.200 --> 06:42.060]  And at this point, is she now naked because she's got no bathrobe?
[06:42.320 --> 06:44.540]  Yeah, she's in a towel, wondering where her bathrobe is, yeah.
[06:47.040 --> 06:48.040]  So that's Christ.
[06:48.080 --> 06:48.940]  That's my first story.
[06:49.140 --> 06:52.340]  I locked myself out of the bed, out of the room with the dog with no clothes on
[06:52.340 --> 06:53.200]  and no way to get back in.
[06:53.960 --> 06:57.860]  And then, uh, and then, uh, uh, I go to bed.
[06:57.880 --> 06:58.420]  I'm not feeling well.
[06:58.500 --> 06:58.940]  I'll get to that.
[06:59.440 --> 07:00.180]  Get up next day.
[07:00.300 --> 07:02.640]  Go, uh, get on the road, go get breakfast.
[07:02.640 --> 07:06.480]  We're about three hours into the trip and Emily goes, the turkey!
[07:07.260 --> 07:11.300]  The, uh, the turkey's still in the fridge, to my knowledge.
[07:11.520 --> 07:11.540]  No!
[07:12.340 --> 07:12.860]  No!
[07:13.520 --> 07:16.460]  Double tree, uh, in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
[07:16.460 --> 07:17.720]  Oh my god!
[07:18.140 --> 07:18.920]  Three hours.
[07:19.140 --> 07:21.260]  It was three hours into a five hour drive.
[07:21.420 --> 07:23.300]  We were not turning around and going back.
[07:23.840 --> 07:27.560]  Turning that three, turning that five hour drive into like an 11 hour drive.
[07:27.680 --> 07:28.720]  It's just not going to do it.
[07:29.280 --> 07:37.340]  And so, uh, I hope that the cleaning staff or the employees of the double tree had one
[07:37.340 --> 07:45.620]  hell of a turkey for Thanksgiving because they had a 17 pound monster just sitting in the
[07:45.620 --> 07:51.220]  fridge, chilling out, perfectly smoked, smelled amazing, just waiting for him.
[07:51.340 --> 07:56.440]  And then the entire week I was in Branson, everybody just was like, man, turkey, this
[07:56.440 --> 07:58.100]  is a good day, but turkey would have made it so much better.
[07:58.100 --> 08:04.940]  And, uh, I can't believe you forgot the turkey.
[08:05.060 --> 08:06.500]  How do you forget the turkey?
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.020]  Well, I was a little distracted.
[08:09.580 --> 08:15.240]  Um, the day before we left, all right, let me explain it like this.
[08:15.780 --> 08:19.800]  I've been experiencing for the past month, it's not something I talked about you or anybody
[08:19.800 --> 08:25.040]  with, but for the past month or so, I've been experiencing and, uh, difficult to define
[08:25.040 --> 08:33.580]  an amorphous anxiety that has been, uh, difficult for me to get a hold of, to get, uh, to get
[08:33.580 --> 08:34.080]  under control.
[08:35.380 --> 08:40.300]  Um, and, uh, so it's just been something I've been working on and, and just kind of trying
[08:40.300 --> 08:40.820]  to fight through.
[08:40.960 --> 08:45.980]  But one of the ways my anxiety tends to manifest on the rare occasions that I have it is that
[08:45.980 --> 08:50.780]  it, it gives me phantom mouth pain, you know, because like my biggest fear is my teeth.
[08:50.780 --> 08:56.060]  And so I get a, a particular kind of like phantom mouth pain, like a buzzing feeling
[08:56.060 --> 09:01.660]  in my mouth that, uh, in one area that I just, I know it's not real, but it is, but I can
[09:01.660 --> 09:02.160]  still feel it.
[09:02.180 --> 09:02.560]  It is real.
[09:02.700 --> 09:07.100]  It's been so bad that I've gone to the dentist twice before and had full checkups and they're
[09:07.100 --> 09:07.920]  like, it's nothing there.
[09:07.920 --> 09:10.640]  And then it goes away after that, after they tell me there's nothing there, it goes away,
[09:10.660 --> 09:10.820]  right?
[09:11.360 --> 09:15.780]  So the day before the trip, I start to kind of feel that a little bit and I'm like, well,
[09:15.800 --> 09:17.100]  I'm about to have a long trip.
[09:17.100 --> 09:17.700]  It's stressful.
[09:17.900 --> 09:19.180]  I've been having this anxiety.
[09:19.180 --> 09:21.980]  I don't know what, I'm not doing a good job of handling it.
[09:22.500 --> 09:24.600]  And I think it just, it has to be that I'm just in my head.
[09:24.660 --> 09:25.300]  I got to get out of my head.
[09:25.360 --> 09:25.860]  I got to get out of my head.
[09:26.240 --> 09:27.240]  And so I try to ignore it.
[09:27.260 --> 09:27.880]  I try to ignore it.
[09:27.880 --> 09:28.660]  It gets worse.
[09:28.780 --> 09:29.500]  It gets worse.
[09:29.600 --> 09:31.920]  The pain starts to move around a little bit.
[09:31.980 --> 09:37.800]  It's, it's, it's radiating in my ear and in my jaw to my upper and my lower teeth on the
[09:37.800 --> 09:38.420]  left side.
[09:38.520 --> 09:44.820]  It starts to shoot down my neck and, um, like I can feel it on my chest and, uh, and then
[09:44.820 --> 09:47.340]  like it just, it comes and goes and comes and goes.
[09:47.380 --> 09:48.480]  It doesn't ever keep me from sleeping.
[09:48.480 --> 09:52.500]  But so I start the trip and I'm like, well, this sucks that I have to, to deal with this
[09:52.500 --> 09:52.920]  on the trip.
[09:52.920 --> 09:58.200]  And then it just gets worse and worse and worse to the point where, and then there'll
[09:58.200 --> 09:59.900]  be days where I think it's getting better and it's going away.
[09:59.920 --> 10:00.960]  And then it's back with a vengeance.
[10:01.160 --> 10:06.840]  And on Thanksgiving day, it got so bad that we were at that.
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.060]  They're like the Hillbilly theme park in Branson, Silver Dollar City, which is fucking delightful
[10:11.060 --> 10:11.460]  by the way.
[10:12.000 --> 10:13.920]  And we have to take Gavin to Branson.
[10:14.080 --> 10:14.860]  Oh my God.
[10:14.960 --> 10:16.640]  We have got to take Branson, Gavin to Branson.
[10:16.640 --> 10:18.660]  I went to a magic dinner theater.
[10:18.920 --> 10:22.360]  I what and howled and so loud.
[10:22.460 --> 10:23.020]  Oh my God.
[10:23.040 --> 10:23.800]  I was like, what?
[10:23.960 --> 10:25.160]  It was fucking great.
[10:25.520 --> 10:26.880]  And I had the time of my life.
[10:26.960 --> 10:29.220]  Anyway, you're, you're going to love, you've never seen America.
[10:29.320 --> 10:30.440]  None of us have seen America.
[10:30.620 --> 10:31.200]  It is Branson.
[10:32.340 --> 10:35.680]  But anyway, about halfway through the day, it was just hurting so bad that I just took
[10:35.680 --> 10:38.160]  all the, the, the grandparents home cause they were tired anyway.
[10:38.400 --> 10:44.340]  And then I just, and I got in bed and I started looking up emergency dentists and I found a
[10:44.340 --> 10:48.860]  dentist, like an hour and 15 minutes away in Springfield that had an appointment at
[10:48.860 --> 10:50.400]  like 8am on Friday morning.
[10:50.580 --> 10:51.640]  And I booked it.
[10:51.820 --> 10:55.860]  And Emily and I drove at like seven in the morning from Brant, from our house in Branson
[10:55.860 --> 10:58.900]  with the whole family, all the way to Springfield to go.
[10:59.320 --> 11:01.040]  And I got x-rays taken.
[11:01.260 --> 11:04.360]  I was convinced I was going to need to get a root canal on this bottom tooth.
[11:04.380 --> 11:07.440]  And they looked it all over and there's fucking nothing wrong with my teeth.
[11:07.640 --> 11:13.800]  And they tell me that I probably have been clenching my jaw or grinding my teeth in my
[11:13.800 --> 11:17.400]  sleep due to stress and that I have now developed TMJ issues.
[11:17.660 --> 11:18.560]  Oh no!
[11:19.040 --> 11:25.560]  So that the pain I'm feeling is real and it's really intense and really bad because I've
[11:25.560 --> 11:27.680]  now been clenching the entire left side of my body.
[11:28.180 --> 11:32.700]  And so they send me to the grocery store to get like an over-the-counter mouth guard,
[11:32.800 --> 11:34.400]  which I use and that helps.
[11:34.640 --> 11:40.040]  And then this morning, first thing, I went to my dentist and got fitted for a permanent
[11:40.040 --> 11:40.620]  mouth guard.
[11:40.620 --> 11:44.920]  Now, TMJ is a thing that I have that I have to deal with.
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.900]  And my mouth has hurt for 12 straight days and it hurts right now.
[11:47.960 --> 11:49.280]  And I don't know when it's going to stop.
[11:50.800 --> 11:51.520]  That's awful.
[11:52.220 --> 11:54.140]  Why did everyone go with you?
[11:55.040 --> 11:56.920]  Who went with you to the dentist?
[11:57.240 --> 11:57.820]  Oh, just Emily.
[11:58.080 --> 11:58.660]  Emily and I went to the dentist.
[11:58.680 --> 11:59.040]  Oh, okay.
[11:59.140 --> 12:00.540]  I thought like the whole family went.
[12:00.740 --> 12:01.960]  No, no, no, no, she just...
[12:01.960 --> 12:02.600]  No, I'm sorry.
[12:03.260 --> 12:07.940]  She just drove me in case I got numbed up like, you know, I had to get like nitrous or
[12:07.940 --> 12:08.120]  something.
[12:08.660 --> 12:13.740]  I thought the way that that was explained, I thought that Emily and the rest of the family
[12:13.740 --> 12:17.500]  drove an hour and a half with you to be told that you don't need surgery.
[12:17.720 --> 12:21.480]  I was, dude, I was like, there's no way that that's what happened.
[12:21.720 --> 12:23.720]  That, that sucks.
[12:23.840 --> 12:26.400]  So like, what's like the long-term, like what's next?
[12:26.480 --> 12:27.140]  Like, what do you do?
[12:27.620 --> 12:32.540]  Well, I'm using the over-the-counter thing until the new one comes, the permanent one
[12:32.540 --> 12:34.020]  comes in, which by the way, they're expensive.
[12:34.040 --> 12:35.620]  It was $400 to get a mouth guard.
[12:35.660 --> 12:36.100]  Oh my God.
[12:36.200 --> 12:36.700]  Frickin' hell.
[12:37.340 --> 12:40.500]  And I don't get that till like December 23rd.
[12:40.580 --> 12:43.060]  And so I'll just continue using this one.
[12:43.200 --> 12:48.800]  They prescribed me some muscle relaxers for my jaw, for my, I can't remember the name
[12:48.800 --> 12:50.660]  of the masseter muscle, I guess.
[12:52.440 --> 12:59.680]  And I am going to see a sports chiropractor and therapist on Wednesday to see about what
[12:59.680 --> 13:04.760]  they can do to help relieve the pressure and, and the, yeah, and work out some of the stress.
[13:04.760 --> 13:09.180]  Jay, go away after a period of non-clenching or is that like a long-term thing?
[13:09.180 --> 13:10.480]  I assume so.
[13:10.660 --> 13:11.560]  It came out of nowhere.
[13:12.020 --> 13:16.140]  And I, I recognize that it's got to just be the, the anxiety I'm feeling and I don't
[13:16.140 --> 13:17.820]  know, I don't have anywhere to put it, you know?
[13:17.840 --> 13:20.140]  And so it's finding its own path.
[13:20.460 --> 13:23.660]  I had a thing, it was probably like a few months into the pandemic, but my jaw hurt
[13:23.660 --> 13:26.180]  for like two or three months, but maybe it was that.
[13:26.320 --> 13:27.200]  Maybe I was just clenching.
[13:27.620 --> 13:29.000]  I bet you were just clenching.
[13:29.260 --> 13:29.940]  I bet you were.
[13:30.100 --> 13:30.300]  Yeah.
[13:30.300 --> 13:35.580]  And so it just sucks because it's just like my left, it just feels like it's like a withering
[13:35.580 --> 13:36.540]  pain, you know?
[13:36.540 --> 13:37.780]  And it's definitely better than it was.
[13:37.820 --> 13:41.480]  It's like a tenth of how bad it was, but just fucking wears you down after a while.
[13:41.940 --> 13:45.680]  You have somebody who, I have a friend who recently went through this and I, I'd never
[13:45.680 --> 13:47.140]  heard of this before to help with it.
[13:47.440 --> 13:49.200]  They got Botox in their jaw.
[13:49.680 --> 13:51.860]  So you might, you might be on a Botox night.
[13:52.340 --> 13:53.960]  Emily is, wants me to do that.
[13:54.040 --> 13:54.140]  Yeah.
[13:54.160 --> 13:55.080]  She's already suggested it.
[13:55.120 --> 13:59.280]  I wanted to see the dentist first, but yeah, I might, I might get Botox in my jaw as well
[13:59.280 --> 13:59.760]  this week.
[14:00.420 --> 14:02.000]  Botox is a crazy medicine.
[14:02.180 --> 14:05.060]  I feel like you can also get Botox for migraines and stuff.
[14:05.360 --> 14:05.500]  Yeah.
[14:05.560 --> 14:05.780]  Really?
[14:06.040 --> 14:07.240]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:07.720 --> 14:09.420]  It can, it can help with like a lot of that stuff.
[14:09.500 --> 14:12.700]  Do you think while they're like shooting you up, like in the masseter or whatever, you
[14:12.700 --> 14:15.320]  think they'll like just take care of like a couple other things too?
[14:15.340 --> 14:16.520]  And you'll be like a new man or?
[14:16.760 --> 14:19.460]  Dude, I don't, here's the thing about me.
[14:19.800 --> 14:20.800]  I want wrinkles.
[14:20.980 --> 14:21.940]  I think they're cool.
[14:22.160 --> 14:23.660]  I like my favorite actor.
[14:24.060 --> 14:27.060]  My favorite, like my favorite looking dude is Lance Hendrickson.
[14:27.360 --> 14:29.120]  I think that guy's face is awesome.
[14:29.120 --> 14:30.640]  I want wrinkles like him.
[14:30.740 --> 14:32.140]  I'm not hiding from wrinkles.
[14:32.300 --> 14:33.580]  I want them and I want them early.
[14:33.680 --> 14:36.580]  I don't, I, I'm, I'm not going to be one of those dudes.
[14:37.180 --> 14:40.480]  I will get the Botox purely to save myself from the pain.
[14:40.560 --> 14:42.080]  But man, I don't want a clean forehead.
[14:42.360 --> 14:45.080]  I want a forehead that looks like I had a shitty life.
[14:45.780 --> 14:49.960]  Do you also want to do the knife trick on your fingers with someone else's hand?
[14:51.700 --> 14:56.340]  Botox might be the most legitimate medicine that has the worst branding
[14:56.340 --> 14:57.460]  on my head.
[14:58.000 --> 15:01.700]  Because whenever I hear about Botox, I just think of Christmas with the cranks.
[15:02.500 --> 15:04.660]  It's the only time I think of Christmas with the cranks.
[15:05.560 --> 15:09.740]  It's like a branded, this Tim Allen with a shitty face that's stuck.
[15:10.180 --> 15:10.820]  I don't even remember.
[15:10.880 --> 15:14.160]  It's like he's at a dinner and he gets Botox and he can't move his mouth.
[15:14.240 --> 15:16.460]  But this is, to me, this is the face of Botox.
[15:16.700 --> 15:19.460]  So to hear that it's like a legitimate medicine.
[15:20.100 --> 15:21.720]  Send the same picture.
[15:22.740 --> 15:25.160]  They just redrew his eyebrows.
[15:25.800 --> 15:26.840]  Like what?
[15:28.460 --> 15:29.820]  This sucks.
[15:30.120 --> 15:31.840]  This sucks shit.
[15:33.820 --> 15:39.120]  Something happens to him where he has to like get these procedures done and it's a disaster.
[15:39.620 --> 15:42.620]  But yeah, the face of Botox to me.
[15:44.200 --> 15:45.620]  Why is he wearing?
[15:45.980 --> 15:49.080]  Why is he wearing like a Miami Vice jacket with a shirt?
[15:50.020 --> 15:54.820]  He looks like the sidekick guy from Eastbound and Downer.
[15:55.320 --> 15:56.200]  He does.
[15:58.080 --> 15:59.860]  That's exactly what he looks like.
[15:59.880 --> 16:00.940]  Like the Sixth and this guy.
[16:01.760 --> 16:02.200]  Yeah.
[16:03.360 --> 16:04.020]  Oh, man.
[16:04.500 --> 16:07.420]  I don't even remember what that movie was about, but it was not good.
[16:09.060 --> 16:11.780]  So Christmas with the cranks, I remember what it was about.
[16:11.960 --> 16:13.060]  They were going to go to...
[16:14.760 --> 16:18.500]  Instead of having a shitty, snowy Christmas like in Long Island or wherever,
[16:18.880 --> 16:20.640]  he and his wife, which was Jamie Lee Curtis,
[16:20.980 --> 16:24.900]  they were going to go to the beach and have like an awesome beach vacation.
[16:25.520 --> 16:28.300]  And they were like rude to everybody kind of around who was like,
[16:28.360 --> 16:29.460]  are you going to miss out on Christmas?
[16:29.600 --> 16:32.560]  And then they ended up not being able to go and they were stuck at home.
[16:32.620 --> 16:35.540]  And then everybody tried to like drag them into the Christmas spirit
[16:35.540 --> 16:36.880]  and they didn't want any part of it.
[16:37.060 --> 16:37.620]  I see.
[16:38.140 --> 16:40.460]  So do you look like a boxer when you're sleeping now?
[16:42.140 --> 16:43.580]  Yeah, it's a little guard.
[16:43.660 --> 16:45.580]  It kind of sucks and it doesn't work for shit.
[16:45.600 --> 16:47.980]  And it falls out of my mouth three times a night and I got to put it back in.
[16:48.060 --> 16:48.560]  It wakes me up.
[16:48.680 --> 16:53.480]  But, you know, I'll have the real one in a couple of weeks and then hopefully...
[16:54.100 --> 16:56.540]  Do you think like before you go to bed, when you have the real one,
[16:56.600 --> 16:58.720]  you'll say ring the bell and then you'll put the mouth guard in
[16:58.720 --> 17:02.680]  and then you'll act like somebody knocked you out and you'll go to sleep?
[17:03.000 --> 17:05.980]  I hope so, because that's a much tougher way to go to bed
[17:05.980 --> 17:07.680]  than laying in bed and hearing my wife go,
[17:08.020 --> 17:10.300]  don't forget to put your little mouth thing in.
[17:12.460 --> 17:15.460]  The fucking most emasculating thing I can hear.
[17:16.340 --> 17:17.060]  Yes, mommy.
[17:18.740 --> 17:23.720]  Remember the iconic Mike Tyson walkout of it's just like chains rattling,
[17:24.040 --> 17:28.700]  essentially, you brush your teeth and then that music starts playing as you walk into bed.
[17:29.660 --> 17:33.960]  You're the first person who hears the alarm first and then goes to sleep.
[17:34.460 --> 17:36.160]  Really switching it up.
[17:37.700 --> 17:40.160]  Maybe you just recreate boxing movies in bed.
[17:40.500 --> 17:42.540]  We should just get you boxing themed stuff,
[17:42.640 --> 17:45.140]  like a giant pillow that looks like a punching bag.
[17:45.140 --> 17:47.400]  This is such a good idea.
[17:47.780 --> 17:49.280]  Yeah, and sleep gloves.
[17:49.660 --> 17:52.620]  You know what fucking sucks? You know what really fucking sucks?
[17:52.860 --> 17:56.800]  That the last like eight years of my life has been like one catastrophe
[17:57.450 --> 18:00.220]  in front of another catastrophe constantly.
[18:00.440 --> 18:03.720]  And then when I finally get past it all, my brain goes,
[18:04.040 --> 18:06.660]  hey, hold on now, hold on now.
[18:07.020 --> 18:09.860]  That's that, no, we can't just let things be good.
[18:10.180 --> 18:12.500]  How about if we wrench your face in half?
[18:12.720 --> 18:14.180]  How about if we just twist it?
[18:14.180 --> 18:17.620]  And that'll be fun for a while. Why can't things just be cool?
[18:18.140 --> 18:22.000]  I feel like all of your catastrophes as well, instead of dying down,
[18:22.320 --> 18:24.860]  there's just like filler root canals in between.
[18:25.280 --> 18:28.840]  It's like in Tony Hawk when you want to do a manual between the tricks.
[18:30.580 --> 18:31.960]  Those are my root canals.
[18:32.120 --> 18:33.920]  Yeah, just keep the combo going.
[18:34.620 --> 18:36.840]  Jeff, we got to get you personalized towels.
[18:36.940 --> 18:38.920]  So that way when it's bedtime, you got to throw in the towel.
[18:42.500 --> 18:47.000]  Oh yeah, let's make, why don't we all take a different piece and make Jeff a boxing sleep kit?
[18:47.800 --> 18:49.820]  Oh, that's really sweet of you guys. I appreciate it.
[18:49.900 --> 18:53.280]  Now you don't have to wear Emily's robe anymore because you'll have a new robe
[18:53.280 --> 18:57.500]  that says like ram scoop or whatever on the back. This is really exciting.
[18:58.360 --> 19:00.460]  You know, Jeff, you can get Kool-Aid mouth guards,
[19:00.480 --> 19:03.060]  really just like embrace the flavor, have a good time.
[19:03.320 --> 19:05.840]  Now that's pretty cool. That is pretty cool.
[19:05.840 --> 19:11.020]  That's the most white trash thing is going to sleep tasting Kool-Aid.
[19:14.260 --> 19:18.400]  And then maybe some nights we could just have the corner of a ring as a nightstand
[19:18.400 --> 19:20.940]  and I'll just sit in it and like coach you to sleep a little bit.
[19:21.260 --> 19:27.180]  Oh, this is a good idea. Oh, this is such, man, I love, Jeff, your mouth,
[19:27.220 --> 19:30.240]  your mouth guard has just opened up like a whole possibility for us.
[19:30.240 --> 19:36.080]  If this helps me eliminate mouth pain, I am 100% on board.
[19:36.220 --> 19:38.760]  I'll put the chair in the spot right now, Gavin.
[19:39.660 --> 19:43.260]  I'm so desperate not to feel pain in my mouth. I'm ready.
[19:43.600 --> 19:45.240]  Whatever it takes, whatever it takes, coach.
[19:45.860 --> 19:50.400]  So that's two of us with sleep injuries. So you're clenching too much
[19:50.400 --> 19:51.980]  and Andrew's ankles are going into sleep.
[19:52.760 --> 19:56.520]  Yeah, I'm glad I've avoided that for quite a while, which is nice, but oh, nightmare.
[19:56.620 --> 19:58.340]  No sleep injuries in the last year or so?
[19:58.340 --> 20:01.820]  No, it'd be like where my ankle would be sore and then I'd dream that I'd roll it.
[20:01.920 --> 20:04.280]  And I'd like hyper extend it.
[20:04.540 --> 20:05.460]  Funny makes it real.
[20:05.980 --> 20:07.240]  Yeah, awful.
[20:10.000 --> 20:13.900]  Hey, it's Paris. You know, I love sparkly things, right?
[20:13.940 --> 20:19.760]  Like stars, duh. And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp, I just slept under them.
[20:20.480 --> 20:24.640]  Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious airstream,
[20:24.640 --> 20:29.520]  making s'mores with the kids while a national park is our backdrop.
[20:30.180 --> 20:32.420]  The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.
[20:32.940 --> 20:33.680]  That's hot.
[20:34.320 --> 20:37.340]  Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com.
[20:37.680 --> 20:39.080]  Hilton for the stay.
[20:39.640 --> 20:44.360]  A massage chair might seem a bit extravagant, especially these days.
[20:44.820 --> 20:47.400]  Eight different settings, adjustable intensity.
[20:48.000 --> 20:51.220]  Plus it's heated and it just feels so good.
[20:51.220 --> 20:56.900]  Yes, a massage chair might seem a bit extravagant, but when it can come with a car,
[20:58.540 --> 21:00.520]  suddenly it seems quite practical.
[21:01.060 --> 21:03.640]  The all new 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan,
[21:03.980 --> 21:07.260]  packed with premium features like available massaging front seats.
[21:07.580 --> 21:09.380]  It only feels extravagant.
[21:11.420 --> 21:14.360]  So did everybody do their sign homework?
[21:15.140 --> 21:15.440]  Sure did.
[21:15.540 --> 21:17.280]  I did some sign homework.
[21:17.380 --> 21:20.140]  I couldn't quite remember what I was supposed to be doing.
[21:21.280 --> 21:23.660]  The homework was just make a sign.
[21:24.040 --> 21:26.540]  How many signs did everybody make?
[21:26.680 --> 21:27.020]  I made three.
[21:27.200 --> 21:27.420]  I have three.
[21:27.980 --> 21:31.400]  Oh, really? I only have one, but I feel really good about it.
[21:31.700 --> 21:35.040]  I made nine, but I probably only have three good ones.
[21:35.800 --> 21:36.240]  Wow.
[21:36.860 --> 21:37.740]  Holy cow.
[21:38.340 --> 21:40.160]  I made three and I don't think any of them are that good.
[21:41.540 --> 21:47.200]  I feel good about mine, but it's definitely already a thing that people have thought of
[21:47.200 --> 21:51.620]  because it's a very easy thing to like Google and look up, but I want it.
[21:51.940 --> 21:53.040]  I want it implemented.
[21:54.360 --> 22:00.760]  I think that while you're on the freeway, these should be just every so often.
[22:00.880 --> 22:03.500]  There's there shouldn't be like a rhyme or reason to like where they
[22:03.500 --> 22:05.360]  should be, but this is just a reminder.
[22:05.740 --> 22:07.140]  I think we need more go signs.
[22:08.660 --> 22:11.080]  This is just a sign to let people know.
[22:11.240 --> 22:12.680]  Why are you slowing down?
[22:12.800 --> 22:13.860]  Stop looking at this thing.
[22:13.920 --> 22:15.040]  Go, just go.
[22:15.040 --> 22:17.040]  Wait, that's that's not a stationary sign.
[22:17.100 --> 22:18.720]  That's one that someone holds, surely.
[22:19.220 --> 22:20.040]  No, no, no.
[22:20.160 --> 22:22.100]  They would just be stationary on the side of the highway.
[22:22.280 --> 22:22.440]  Yeah.
[22:22.880 --> 22:23.540]  Yeah, just go.
[22:23.640 --> 22:25.720]  I mean, you can put them on regular streets and everything, too.
[22:25.760 --> 22:28.880]  But then you think people might be going too fast because they're so used to seeing them
[22:28.880 --> 22:29.420]  on freeways.
[22:29.460 --> 22:29.920]  Just go.
[22:30.480 --> 22:31.420]  You know, it's funny, Eric.
[22:31.900 --> 22:34.220]  We had very similar thoughts for one of that.
[22:34.220 --> 22:35.640]  That ties into one of my signs.
[22:36.360 --> 22:37.680]  Slightly different spirit.
[22:38.260 --> 22:41.580]  You wanted things to progress in a helpful way with the go sign.
[22:42.080 --> 22:43.780]  I just wanted to confuse people.
[22:43.780 --> 22:47.620]  So mine is a stop sign that is just a stop sign.
[22:47.760 --> 22:50.120]  But it says go with green letters on it.
[22:50.460 --> 22:50.940]  Really.
[22:51.260 --> 22:52.780]  I thought about that, too.
[22:52.880 --> 22:54.220]  But that's too confusing.
[22:54.760 --> 22:57.980]  Really just throwing a wrench into their driving plan.
[22:58.120 --> 22:59.080]  They don't know what to do.
[22:59.660 --> 23:03.300]  I don't know if you did it intentionally, but the green on red and so small.
[23:03.900 --> 23:04.860]  Absolute eyesore.
[23:05.100 --> 23:05.860]  Like, yeah, it is.
[23:05.940 --> 23:07.040]  Yeah, it's ugly.
[23:07.140 --> 23:08.680]  And also the text is small.
[23:08.700 --> 23:10.240]  So you have to, like, try to squint it.
[23:10.300 --> 23:11.280]  Like, is that a stop?
[23:11.340 --> 23:12.240]  It's just go?
[23:12.240 --> 23:14.480]  Yeah, at a distance, it's stop.
[23:14.580 --> 23:17.280]  And then as you creep closer, it's like, ah, son of a bitch.
[23:17.400 --> 23:18.060]  This is good.
[23:18.300 --> 23:21.140]  I think on the freeway every so often, again, no rhyme or reason,
[23:21.280 --> 23:23.300]  like it shouldn't be like every 100 yards or whatever.
[23:23.580 --> 23:27.580]  It's just throw in some of my go signs, but also throw in some of Andrew's go signs.
[23:28.620 --> 23:29.800]  You don't know what's coming.
[23:30.020 --> 23:30.600]  Yeah, yeah, you don't.
[23:30.760 --> 23:32.140]  Well, you kind of know.
[23:32.420 --> 23:32.660]  Go!
[23:33.500 --> 23:33.980]  That's true.
[23:36.300 --> 23:37.940]  Jeff, do you want to share one of your signs or Gavin?
[23:38.020 --> 23:38.580]  Oh, yeah.
[23:38.880 --> 23:40.240]  I didn't make pictures of mine.
[23:40.300 --> 23:40.840]  I feel bad.
[23:41.520 --> 23:49.120]  My first sign that I have is for individuals who may not know exactly what they need the sign for
[23:49.120 --> 23:52.820]  today, but they know they're going to need a sign in the near future.
[23:53.220 --> 24:00.200]  So you get the not for underline sign and then you can write in whatever it's not for in the future.
[24:01.660 --> 24:03.840]  So like a future proofed sign?
[24:04.320 --> 24:09.820]  Yeah, not for eating, not for diaper changing or like whatever it is.
[24:09.820 --> 24:12.380]  Yeah, multi-use.
[24:12.540 --> 24:13.880]  Similar to one of my signs.
[24:15.940 --> 24:16.960]  It's in progress.
[24:17.860 --> 24:18.380]  Notice sign.
[24:18.480 --> 24:19.400]  Oh, I like that.
[24:19.520 --> 24:24.180]  It will be something, but currently it's just a warning because my favorite sign,
[24:24.660 --> 24:28.120]  my favorite real sign in America is this stupid thing.
[24:29.040 --> 24:31.020]  It's a sign about a sign coming up.
[24:31.560 --> 24:32.260]  Yeah, yeah, there's a sign.
[24:32.320 --> 24:32.740]  Stop ahead.
[24:33.040 --> 24:33.320]  Absolutely.
[24:33.740 --> 24:35.380]  I couldn't believe that's a real thing.
[24:36.660 --> 24:39.360]  You don't want people to be warned that there's a stop ahead?
[24:39.820 --> 24:42.500]  There's a sign ahead, though, for the stop.
[24:42.860 --> 24:43.840]  Well, here's the thing.
[24:43.980 --> 24:49.980]  Maybe Andrew's go sign can be used instead of this where now people know to keep going,
[24:50.060 --> 24:54.240]  but just heads up, there's a stop sign coming up and that's how they can be warned.
[24:54.380 --> 24:57.700]  So keep going until you see the next one of these and it says stop.
[24:58.040 --> 25:00.900]  Maybe it'd be more helpful if you saw it in this format,
[25:01.420 --> 25:05.960]  sign posted sign to let you know that there's a sign posted ahead somewhere.
[25:06.160 --> 25:06.800]  That would be helpful.
[25:07.360 --> 25:09.140]  But it's all words instead of pictures,
[25:09.380 --> 25:12.640]  so you won't be looking for a stop sign because it could be a different kind of sign.
[25:13.080 --> 25:13.440]  Sign posted.
[25:14.100 --> 25:16.420]  So if I miss the sign posted and I ended up in a car accident,
[25:16.540 --> 25:21.380]  I swear to God, I better be having a warhead mouth guard in because I don't want to be locked in.
[25:21.460 --> 25:24.280]  Andrew is finding some real stuff for you, man. This is great.
[25:25.500 --> 25:28.000]  I've got another sign, just a warning sign.
[25:30.640 --> 25:31.520]  Poster, you idiot.
[25:31.960 --> 25:32.740]  Poster, you fool.
[25:33.320 --> 25:33.900]  Is it a dong?
[25:34.820 --> 25:35.400]  I may have been donged.
[25:35.400 --> 25:38.120]  It just says it's type and it's processing.
[25:38.320 --> 25:38.600]  Oh, there we go.
[25:39.360 --> 25:39.620]  Oh!
[25:39.840 --> 25:41.580]  Lightning has not struck here yet.
[25:42.560 --> 25:43.420]  It's possible.
[25:44.080 --> 25:45.020]  That is dangerous.
[25:45.380 --> 25:48.370]  And my final sign, my final sign would be,
[25:49.160 --> 25:51.880]  just maybe slightly lower down on the side of the road.
[25:52.680 --> 25:53.400]  Upside down.
[25:54.140 --> 25:55.380]  You can't park there, mate.
[25:56.120 --> 25:58.800]  If you roll your car right in front of that.
[26:00.000 --> 26:00.980]  Useful instruction.
[26:01.680 --> 26:02.760]  It's a very useful sign.
[26:03.660 --> 26:05.140]  Very specific, but I like it.
[26:07.240 --> 26:09.900]  I, uh, one of my signs.
[26:10.400 --> 26:14.440]  Very, you know, it's an important thing to notice when you do notice it.
[26:14.500 --> 26:18.380]  But if you don't notice it, that's OK, because it is a I saw the sign sign.
[26:19.700 --> 26:22.320]  Just for anyone who happens to see it.
[26:22.600 --> 26:25.320]  They can say that they, in fact, did see the sign.
[26:27.700 --> 26:29.480]  And my last sign.
[26:29.760 --> 26:31.280]  Why is it on like a wooden board?
[26:31.980 --> 26:33.900]  I just used a template.
[26:34.100 --> 26:35.260]  I just was like, yeah, it works.
[26:35.400 --> 26:36.420]  It's very Sea of Thieves.
[26:36.980 --> 26:37.880]  It is very Sea of Thieves.
[26:38.560 --> 26:42.320]  My final sign, which is, I mean, I think maybe the truest expression of signs,
[26:42.500 --> 26:46.060]  generally speaking, is a sign that just says, nobody cares.
[26:46.320 --> 26:46.680]  It doesn't.
[26:46.800 --> 26:47.520]  This sign doesn't matter.
[26:47.940 --> 26:48.800]  No one's going to follow this.
[26:49.380 --> 26:49.960]  Doesn't matter.
[26:50.660 --> 26:51.620]  They're not really going to stop.
[26:51.700 --> 26:53.080]  They're going to stop for half a second ago.
[26:53.400 --> 26:54.200]  There won't be a full stop.
[26:54.720 --> 26:56.200]  I think these are some great signs, guys.
[26:56.820 --> 26:58.340]  You want to rattle off the rest of yours, Jeff?
[26:58.480 --> 26:59.720]  Oh, well, yeah.
[26:59.720 --> 27:01.800]  I mean, when you're dealing with a lot of signs,
[27:02.300 --> 27:04.880]  sometimes you want to know if you're in a sign zone.
[27:04.880 --> 27:08.020]  That way, you'll know to look out for more signs.
[27:08.180 --> 27:11.540]  But then at some point, sometimes you leave your sign zone.
[27:12.300 --> 27:15.020]  Maybe you don't want to be in a sign zone anymore.
[27:15.140 --> 27:16.760]  You want to be in a sign-free zone.
[27:17.100 --> 27:19.500]  So you're going to want to, you know...
[27:19.500 --> 27:21.000]  I have to be on the coming up sign, though,
[27:21.040 --> 27:23.180]  because otherwise the sign would be in the sign zone.
[27:23.560 --> 27:24.280]  In the sign-free zone.
[27:24.760 --> 27:26.100]  It's actually a good point.
[27:26.420 --> 27:27.740]  And then it's not always meta.
[27:27.840 --> 27:29.940]  Sometimes you want to convey a message.
[27:30.280 --> 27:33.560]  And I feel this way a lot when I see kids in a yard
[27:34.120 --> 27:36.780]  or like outside of a business having too much fun.
[27:36.920 --> 27:38.080]  You want to have a sign that says,
[27:38.220 --> 27:39.660]  Hey, do not enjoy.
[27:40.140 --> 27:41.800]  This is not what you're here for.
[27:42.540 --> 27:44.040]  If that doesn't do it...
[27:44.040 --> 27:44.640]  Ah, fuck.
[27:44.880 --> 27:45.460]  If that...
[27:45.460 --> 27:46.060]  Ah, fuck.
[27:46.140 --> 27:46.620]  I lost my signs.
[27:46.960 --> 27:49.940]  If that doesn't do it, what if you had a sign posted?
[27:50.200 --> 27:51.580]  A friend said, not for fun.
[27:52.100 --> 27:54.340]  That way, if somebody's like trying to manipulate,
[27:54.720 --> 27:55.080]  they...
[27:55.080 --> 27:56.100]  Maybe the swing...
[27:56.100 --> 27:56.760]  I should swing on it.
[27:56.780 --> 27:57.120]  That's fun.
[27:57.220 --> 27:58.560]  No, this is not a for fun swing.
[27:58.660 --> 27:59.280]  Not for fun.
[27:59.800 --> 28:01.640]  And then also, this is a pretty niche one.
[28:02.240 --> 28:03.580]  I don't think it'll come up a lot.
[28:03.660 --> 28:05.660]  But when you're in it, you want to know.
[28:06.540 --> 28:10.500]  Like, say you walk in a door and suddenly you're in Andrew's mind palace.
[28:10.580 --> 28:12.180]  You're going to want to know you're in a mind palace.
[28:12.280 --> 28:13.520]  So I think a mind palace sign.
[28:14.120 --> 28:15.900]  Oh, I like the mind palace.
[28:16.800 --> 28:17.520]  That's the...
[28:17.520 --> 28:18.220]  That's pretty much it.
[28:18.480 --> 28:21.300]  Most of my other signs were identical to ones you guys made.
[28:24.040 --> 28:25.200]  I like these signs.
[28:25.660 --> 28:28.040]  Jeff, this is a great idea to go deep on the signs.
[28:28.280 --> 28:29.000]  Yeah, it's fun.
[28:29.380 --> 28:29.680]  It's good.
[28:29.680 --> 28:34.160]  We're retreading some Bill Ingvall territory, but not in the same way.
[28:34.300 --> 28:35.360]  His signs are hot, man.
[28:35.500 --> 28:37.500]  Next, we're going to do some Jeff Foxworthy stuff next.
[28:37.640 --> 28:38.300]  It's going to be really good.
[28:38.840 --> 28:40.120]  Bill Ingvall was a sign guy?
[28:40.540 --> 28:40.740]  What?
[28:40.780 --> 28:41.600]  Here's your sign.
[28:41.720 --> 28:42.460]  That's his bit.
[28:42.640 --> 28:44.000]  That's his whole thing.
[28:44.860 --> 28:45.360]  Yeah, he just...
[28:47.020 --> 28:50.580]  Maybe he should have been playing in Branson and then I'd know about it.
[28:50.920 --> 28:55.300]  Honestly, I was going to say it's kind of a surprise that he wasn't in Branson.
[28:56.160 --> 28:59.220]  Did you know that in Branson, you just drive down the road.
[28:59.220 --> 29:00.680]  I drive in Orlando.
[29:00.840 --> 29:02.120]  Everybody knows what I'm talking about.
[29:02.180 --> 29:03.380]  International Drive in Orlando, right?
[29:03.460 --> 29:04.500]  There's like Ripley's, believe it or not.
[29:04.580 --> 29:05.360]  There's Wonder Works.
[29:05.480 --> 29:08.240]  There's all these tourist traps that are like chains, right?
[29:08.620 --> 29:14.580]  But in Branson, every third or fourth one, and there's a million of these things in Branson.
[29:14.760 --> 29:16.020]  There's so much shit to do.
[29:16.060 --> 29:20.220]  There's a Titanic museum I went to where you go through and it's actually kind of cool.
[29:20.440 --> 29:22.800]  You go in and it's like a half a Titanic that they've built.
[29:23.060 --> 29:25.120]  And then they give you a card and they go, this is your name.
[29:25.120 --> 29:29.200]  You're a first, second or third class passenger on the Titanic.
[29:29.620 --> 29:30.720]  And you're a real person.
[29:30.880 --> 29:31.900]  And then you go through the whole museum.
[29:32.000 --> 29:33.840]  And at the end, you find out if you lived or died.
[29:34.040 --> 29:34.460]  I died.
[29:36.360 --> 29:38.020]  I was fucking dead as dicks.
[29:38.960 --> 29:42.540]  But anyway, like every third or fourth building is a family theater.
[29:42.820 --> 29:48.280]  And it's like the Dunbar's every night, five o'clock, seven o'clock and nine o'clock.
[29:48.280 --> 29:50.920]  And it's like a family that sings and performs.
[29:51.020 --> 29:52.960]  And they have their own fucking theater.
[29:52.960 --> 29:58.880]  So if Yakov Smirnov has his own theater with a big picture of him from 40 years ago
[29:58.880 --> 30:04.020]  and a sign that says you'll laugh your mask off to give you an idea of how current the content is there.
[30:04.280 --> 30:08.360]  But if Bill Engvall wanted to, he'd have a shrine there based on some of these buildings.
[30:08.680 --> 30:11.560]  It's like, oh, the Duddards have a three story building.
[30:11.820 --> 30:17.340]  The Presleys have people you've never fucking heard of own entire theaters there.
[30:17.400 --> 30:18.160]  It's crazy.
[30:18.560 --> 30:21.180]  What a weird architecture system.
[30:21.180 --> 30:23.440]  Do they have Branson Pickle?
[30:23.900 --> 30:25.800]  I didn't see any and I looked.
[30:26.520 --> 30:26.720]  It's a shame.
[30:27.360 --> 30:28.060]  That is a shame.
[30:28.460 --> 30:29.360]  What was Nick's sign?
[30:30.080 --> 30:30.780]  Oh, yeah, there's Nick.
[30:30.920 --> 30:32.160]  Do you do your homework?
[30:32.580 --> 30:36.320]  I came up with an answer to the homework during Thanksgiving.
[30:37.080 --> 30:42.740]  Oh, so I have a now this is a different version of the sign that I found.
[30:42.960 --> 30:46.080]  But mine would say don't speak to the chef.
[30:46.760 --> 30:47.660]  And that's because...
[30:48.220 --> 30:49.860]  Is that a knife in his face?
[30:50.420 --> 30:51.420]  No, it's a pan.
[30:51.680 --> 30:52.220]  That's a pan.
[30:52.320 --> 30:55.360]  Oh, oh, the heads behind the outside are here.
[30:55.380 --> 30:55.920]  Are you?
[30:56.200 --> 30:57.640]  Oh, I see.
[30:57.760 --> 31:00.220]  OK, I yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[31:00.220 --> 31:02.000]  OK, I see what I see where you went.
[31:02.140 --> 31:07.820]  OK, guys, because sometimes you're in the middle of trying to figure out,
[31:07.840 --> 31:09.800]  you know, how long this roux has left.
[31:09.820 --> 31:12.000]  And somebody's like, so how's the job been going?
[31:12.240 --> 31:14.480]  All right, chill out.
[31:14.860 --> 31:16.840]  I got to finish mixing this shit.
[31:19.080 --> 31:25.860]  And then the other one is a and this is a this is a very important message,
[31:25.860 --> 31:26.920]  I feel, for most people.
[31:27.040 --> 31:28.680]  That's do not back into spaces.
[31:29.340 --> 31:31.200]  You don't need to back into that space.
[31:31.700 --> 31:32.120]  Why not?
[31:32.320 --> 31:34.300]  Some people love to back into a space.
[31:34.560 --> 31:38.260]  Because it causes everyone else to have to wait for them.
[31:38.260 --> 31:40.460]  And they do this slow little turn.
[31:40.600 --> 31:41.620]  What are you talking about?
[31:41.680 --> 31:43.520]  You have to wait for them to back out otherwise.
[31:44.640 --> 31:45.140]  Yeah, later.
[31:45.140 --> 31:47.440]  What does it matter to anyone else?
[31:47.780 --> 31:53.240]  When you poke a hole in Nick's logic, he just agrees with you.
[31:54.280 --> 31:56.240]  Yeah, later.
[31:57.540 --> 31:59.280]  I'd rather wait on the back end.
[31:59.720 --> 32:04.420]  But if you're just arriving and someone's backing into a space or backing out to a space,
[32:04.860 --> 32:06.720]  you don't care whether they're coming or going.
[32:06.840 --> 32:08.200]  You care get out of the way.
[32:09.520 --> 32:10.420]  Yeah, that's fair.
[32:10.660 --> 32:13.240]  But most of the time you end up following them in.
[32:13.240 --> 32:16.920]  They stop and then they start to back in right in front of you, which takes longer.
[32:17.060 --> 32:21.280]  Right, so if someone backs out of a space as you're coming in, you just keep going?
[32:21.800 --> 32:24.900]  Well, no, but you know that space is cleared and you're going to get that space.
[32:25.020 --> 32:29.180]  There are times where the person who's backing in will go past the space and you may think,
[32:29.600 --> 32:30.980]  oh, this is going to be my space.
[32:31.080 --> 32:33.140]  And then they start reversing into it.
[32:33.520 --> 32:36.680]  Or also, I'll just not give them the room to back out.
[32:39.720 --> 32:40.780]  That is a move.
[32:40.780 --> 32:44.700]  I think that the backing in, I just watched this movie called City of Industry,
[32:45.620 --> 32:48.840]  this Harvey Keitel movie, and Stephen Dorf is in it.
[32:48.900 --> 32:50.900]  And he's like the wheel man in the movie.
[32:51.060 --> 32:56.300]  And he backs into every spot that he parks in to a point where I was watching it going like,
[32:56.760 --> 32:59.340]  what the, like, stop doing this.
[32:59.500 --> 33:01.980]  And then you realize like, oh, that's like his thing.
[33:02.140 --> 33:04.360]  He backs in so he can make like a quick getaway.
[33:04.480 --> 33:05.560]  So did you consider that?
[33:05.900 --> 33:07.820]  Do you consider these people need to make quick getaways?
[33:07.880 --> 33:09.420]  Because they might be in the middle of something.
[33:10.020 --> 33:12.320]  It hadn't occurred to me, but they better cut me in.
[33:13.040 --> 33:14.140]  Oh, that's a good point.
[33:14.240 --> 33:15.060]  Wait, hang on.
[33:15.300 --> 33:16.100]  Why would they?
[33:17.160 --> 33:18.500]  Because they're taking up my time.
[33:18.720 --> 33:19.240]  Time is money.
[33:19.680 --> 33:21.360]  You watch them back into a spot.
[33:21.620 --> 33:24.360]  So they have to cut you in to like the diamond heist.
[33:24.680 --> 33:27.320]  I mean, I watched them back and I waited for them to back in.
[33:28.500 --> 33:32.360]  He, hey, he greases palms a little bit for the inconvenience.
[33:32.680 --> 33:33.400]  A little bit.
[33:33.560 --> 33:36.340]  The guy takes off really fast and throws Nick one diamond.
[33:38.560 --> 33:39.700]  Oh, I'll take it.
[33:39.800 --> 33:41.840]  How do you feel about people parallel parking in front of you?
[33:42.780 --> 33:43.640]  That's a good question.
[33:43.820 --> 33:45.160]  I hadn't thought about it until just now.
[33:45.380 --> 33:47.940]  I think the parallel park is OK because you have to.
[33:48.340 --> 33:48.660]  Right. Yeah.
[33:48.680 --> 33:51.440]  Also, it's a respectable move, because if you can do it,
[33:51.760 --> 33:53.800]  a lot of people complain about not being able to.
[33:54.240 --> 33:55.000]  So could you not do it?
[33:55.040 --> 33:55.440]  I feel like...
[33:55.440 --> 33:56.460]  No, I can do it.
[33:56.600 --> 33:58.640]  Oh, you don't think Nick can parallel park?
[33:58.960 --> 33:59.300]  Yeah.
[33:59.820 --> 34:01.380]  Should we have a parallel park off?
[34:01.660 --> 34:03.220]  Yeah, sure.
[34:04.100 --> 34:05.740]  I think it's the guy that doesn't drive.
[34:05.740 --> 34:10.540]  I was going to say, where do you think you rank in the parallel park off, Gavin?
[34:10.960 --> 34:13.280]  I don't think I'll be the best, but I don't think I'll be the worst.
[34:13.580 --> 34:17.920]  And I think potentially I could do it quicker and better than someone who drives.
[34:18.640 --> 34:19.920]  And who do you think that is?
[34:23.320 --> 34:25.520]  How about double or nothing on the boots, Gavin?
[34:26.160 --> 34:27.120]  On the boots? Oh, no.
[34:28.520 --> 34:31.160]  If I have to do boots, I'm going to wait a year like you did.
[34:31.860 --> 34:34.040]  Wait, double or nothing on the boots.
[34:34.300 --> 34:37.440]  That would mean you have to wear two pairs of boots?
[34:37.620 --> 34:39.380]  I'll put a second pair on my hands.
[34:39.880 --> 34:40.060]  Twice as long.
[34:40.240 --> 34:40.920]  Twice as long.
[34:41.380 --> 34:44.400]  Walk around the mall dog style in red boots.
[34:45.740 --> 34:48.460]  Like fucking Pluto going for a walk.
[34:49.760 --> 34:51.180]  What the hell?
[34:51.380 --> 34:52.920]  Yeah, I immediately wasn't thinking double or nothing.
[34:53.040 --> 34:55.980]  I was thinking like Meg's style, double or double.
[34:57.700 --> 35:00.320]  That is the way that she does it.
[35:00.320 --> 35:02.360]  Double or double.
[35:02.840 --> 35:06.720]  You're disadvantaged somehow either way.
[35:12.160 --> 35:13.160]  Oh, man.
[35:13.960 --> 35:18.080]  Can I tell you guys something about my Thanksgiving that I've kept a secret until now?
[35:18.300 --> 35:20.180]  And I've been debating on if I should bring it up.
[35:20.480 --> 35:21.340]  Oh, my God.
[35:21.900 --> 35:23.800]  I gotta... it'll be a whole story.
[35:24.020 --> 35:27.220]  I flew back to San Diego for one day.
[35:27.520 --> 35:29.760]  I flew in and then flew out the next day.
[35:29.760 --> 35:30.700]  For Thanksgiving.
[35:31.700 --> 35:34.280]  We did it at my grandparents' house there.
[35:34.420 --> 35:35.420]  My grandpa's like 90.
[35:35.620 --> 35:36.300]  I'm like, you know what?
[35:36.360 --> 35:37.660]  This will be... I should go.
[35:37.860 --> 35:39.120]  I should definitely do this.
[35:39.940 --> 35:40.720]  Got on the plane.
[35:41.160 --> 35:41.840]  It was on time.
[35:42.020 --> 35:43.140]  The airport was not that crowded.
[35:43.360 --> 35:44.140]  It was totally fine.
[35:44.540 --> 35:47.740]  As soon as we sat down, the captain came out of the cockpit and said,
[35:48.080 --> 35:49.220]  hey, thanks for boarding.
[35:49.340 --> 35:50.260]  That was really great.
[35:50.360 --> 35:53.460]  So we're going to get you guys all off the plane because we're on a ground delay
[35:53.460 --> 35:55.380]  because of fog into San Diego.
[35:55.580 --> 35:56.720]  And I went, great.
[35:57.100 --> 35:58.580]  So everyone had to get off the plane.
[35:58.760 --> 35:59.300]  That's fine.
[36:00.180 --> 36:01.180]  Got off the plane.
[36:01.320 --> 36:02.780]  Went over to Haymaker at the bar.
[36:02.900 --> 36:07.600]  Talked to a nice hippie guy for an hour.
[36:08.160 --> 36:11.600]  Had a beer and some poutine and then got back on the plane.
[36:12.420 --> 36:13.280]  Flew back in.
[36:13.360 --> 36:14.280]  Then we took off.
[36:14.380 --> 36:15.020]  Flew to San Diego.
[36:15.540 --> 36:18.640]  Circled the desert about eight times before we could go into San Diego.
[36:19.040 --> 36:21.900]  And then finally got into San Diego and they said, ha ha, not so fast.
[36:22.340 --> 36:29.120]  And then we circled on, like we taxied on the ground probably like five times.
[36:29.120 --> 36:31.300]  Just kept driving in circles in the plane.
[36:31.940 --> 36:33.740]  So that was like, oh man, that was weird.
[36:33.800 --> 36:35.240]  That just took like a long time.
[36:35.260 --> 36:38.280]  So it kind of like threw off like the rest of the day, but it was fine.
[36:38.440 --> 36:39.380]  I got a ride.
[36:39.900 --> 36:43.000]  Went to Thanksgiving at my grandparents' house.
[36:43.080 --> 36:44.640]  And I started like not feeling good.
[36:44.860 --> 36:46.220]  I just kind of had like a stomach ache.
[36:46.520 --> 36:49.540]  And then I started feeling like overheated and woozy.
[36:49.800 --> 36:52.680]  And I'm like, man, what happened?
[36:52.820 --> 36:53.760]  Like, why do I not feel good?
[36:53.780 --> 36:55.780]  So I ate dinner and it was fine.
[36:55.780 --> 37:02.780]  And then I like, I went to the bathroom real quick and I felt really sick and I threw up.
[37:03.720 --> 37:05.080]  But I didn't tell anyone.
[37:05.160 --> 37:06.640]  I was just like, oh, I don't want anyone to worry.
[37:06.800 --> 37:08.640]  And I don't, I just feel like off.
[37:10.460 --> 37:13.920]  And after I threw up, I'm like, man, but I guarantee it was nothing that we ate because
[37:13.920 --> 37:14.900]  no one else is sick.
[37:15.000 --> 37:16.580]  I think it was the poutine that I had.
[37:16.660 --> 37:18.000]  And I'm like, oh, do I have poisoning?
[37:19.240 --> 37:25.760]  About 45 minutes later, I'm like, oh, I'm going to shit my pants right now.
[37:28.760 --> 37:32.360]  I had to, my parents live down the street from my grandparents.
[37:32.560 --> 37:35.020]  So I'm like, hey, let me borrow a house key real quick.
[37:35.100 --> 37:38.000]  I have to go get a pill that I have to take with dinner.
[37:38.120 --> 37:39.960]  That's a lie, but it's fine.
[37:40.520 --> 37:48.620]  Ran, well, ran, power walked over to my parents' house as fast as I could without jostling anything.
[37:49.780 --> 37:51.740]  Jeff, I'm sure you can attest to this.
[37:51.740 --> 38:01.660]  When I say that it was a photo finish, I had never felt more sick and then more relieved
[38:02.220 --> 38:04.200]  from one second to the next.
[38:05.840 --> 38:07.880]  Whatever was in me was out of me.
[38:08.320 --> 38:10.360]  I felt totally fine.
[38:10.620 --> 38:14.780]  And then the rest, and then went back to my grandparents' house and was like, great,
[38:14.900 --> 38:15.720]  the rest of the day.
[38:15.880 --> 38:16.900]  I don't know what happened.
[38:16.900 --> 38:22.100]  It was, it all, everything happened within six hours.
[38:22.600 --> 38:32.060]  It was like all of this, all of this fucking travel shit, feeling bad, exploding, feeling
[38:32.060 --> 38:32.900]  like I'm going to die.
[38:32.940 --> 38:35.180]  And then feeling instant relief was all in a six hour period.
[38:35.320 --> 38:38.620]  It was the weirdest Thanksgiving I've ever had in my life.
[38:38.760 --> 38:43.880]  That's the best feeling of relief though, is when the, the shit like fixes the shit
[38:43.880 --> 38:45.820]  feeling and the vomit feeling at the same time.
[38:45.820 --> 38:47.140]  Yep, yep.
[38:47.500 --> 38:50.500]  That's wild that it was so intense and so quick.
[38:50.620 --> 38:53.440]  It was crazy.
[38:53.780 --> 39:00.080]  I've, you know, I've had food poisoning before, but this was like, I mean, I don't know, so
[39:00.080 --> 39:06.800]  sudden and then so out of nowhere and then so over and boy, it was close to being a really
[39:06.800 --> 39:08.720]  different rest of my day.
[39:08.800 --> 39:09.540]  Oh God.
[39:10.100 --> 39:10.880]  Really different.
[39:11.280 --> 39:14.700]  That was, boy, it was weird because I was totally fine after that.
[39:14.700 --> 39:17.640]  I went and hung out with like Mega64 for like the rest of the day over there.
[39:17.680 --> 39:19.240]  And it was like, I didn't feel sick.
[39:19.380 --> 39:20.080]  I didn't feel anything.
[39:20.180 --> 39:21.120]  I went back to my grandparents' house.
[39:21.200 --> 39:21.880]  I like had a drink.
[39:22.360 --> 39:23.180]  It, everything was fine.
[39:23.600 --> 39:25.120]  Did you tell anyone about your photo finish?
[39:25.140 --> 39:28.460]  No, you are the first people that I've brought this up to.
[39:29.100 --> 39:32.700]  Because I was like, oh my God, did I tell, you didn't even tell my wife.
[39:33.100 --> 39:34.400]  I didn't tell anybody.
[39:34.900 --> 39:36.400]  Oh my gosh, she doesn't want to hear about this shit.
[39:37.260 --> 39:38.480]  I didn't tell anyone.
[39:38.780 --> 39:39.940]  And then you guys were talking to me.
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.580]  Jeff had a really bad Thanksgiving story and I'm like, all right, mine isn't great.
[39:44.580 --> 39:48.420]  Well, Eric, your secret's safe with us, buddy.
[39:48.540 --> 39:49.140]  I won't tell anybody.
[39:49.560 --> 39:49.680]  All right.
[39:49.700 --> 39:50.100]  That's good.
[39:50.180 --> 39:50.500]  That's good.
[39:50.540 --> 39:52.620]  Everyone out there listening to this, don't tell anyone.
[39:53.140 --> 39:53.880]  Not a word from me.
[39:55.660 --> 39:56.740]  Shit rats in the chat.
[39:58.380 --> 40:03.540]  Dude, it was, I don't think, I've never, I've never shit my pants and I'm knocking on wood.
[40:03.720 --> 40:07.520]  Uh, but like, boy, that's, that's probably the closest I've ever been.
[40:08.140 --> 40:11.160]  That was sometimes, sometimes when I'm watching a film,
[40:11.440 --> 40:14.180]  if it's a film I've seen a bunch of times, I'm like watching an iconic scene.
[40:14.180 --> 40:17.220]  And I just think, I wonder what I was doing at that exact moment.
[40:17.940 --> 40:19.320]  Like when that was being filmed.
[40:20.100 --> 40:25.640]  And all I was thinking is what was I doing when you were power walking to take a big old
[40:26.160 --> 40:26.880]  liquid shit?
[40:27.140 --> 40:29.040]  I bet I was just chilling on my switch.
[40:29.380 --> 40:30.820]  Let me think about what time it was.
[40:31.020 --> 40:34.280]  It, it was probably, so I was on the, I was on the West coast.
[40:34.440 --> 40:35.380]  So it was on Pacific time.
[40:35.400 --> 40:39.560]  So me and Andrew, you know, clocking like the same, he's probably eating that good ass barbecue.
[40:39.560 --> 40:43.320]  Um, it was the evening.
[40:43.940 --> 40:46.740]  I bet it was five.
[40:47.020 --> 40:49.480]  I bet it was 5.45 PM.
[40:49.620 --> 40:51.140]  So 7.45 your time.
[40:51.320 --> 40:53.000]  Oh, I was probably playing Mario Party.
[40:54.260 --> 40:55.820]  We were both having a party.
[40:55.960 --> 40:58.020]  We were both having a blowout jamboree.
[41:01.420 --> 41:04.260]  Poutine is an insane pick for a flight, in my opinion.
[41:04.840 --> 41:06.020]  What was in it?
[41:06.020 --> 41:09.920]  I wanted something that was just something salty with a beer.
[41:10.160 --> 41:10.280]  Yeah.
[41:10.320 --> 41:11.060]  I just wanted something with a beer.
[41:11.100 --> 41:11.780]  I hadn't eaten all day.
[41:11.840 --> 41:13.540]  And it was like, well, if I'm going to be delayed an hour.
[41:13.600 --> 41:16.120]  And then the guy that I sat and talked to was really cool.
[41:16.200 --> 41:19.820]  It was a guy named Peter who was like rad and like flying to Oakland.
[41:19.920 --> 41:20.720]  He was just a cool guy.
[41:20.980 --> 41:23.160]  And then is he, uh, any chance of pumpkin eater?
[41:24.500 --> 41:25.580]  No, he did.
[41:25.700 --> 41:27.660]  He did though have a wife.
[41:27.700 --> 41:30.360]  And my understanding is that he did not have any trouble feeding her.
[41:30.380 --> 41:32.420]  So everything seemed to be working out for Peter.
[41:32.740 --> 41:33.060]  Okay.
[41:33.060 --> 41:33.680]  Good, good, good.
[41:33.920 --> 41:34.000]  Yeah.
[41:34.160 --> 41:34.340]  Yeah.
[41:34.340 --> 41:34.500]  Yeah.
[41:34.500 --> 41:35.840]  He's just a, he's a cool dude.
[41:35.980 --> 41:39.220]  And then I, it's weird cause it, I felt sick suddenly.
[41:39.320 --> 41:41.040]  And then I don't know.
[41:41.240 --> 41:42.780]  I ate so much at Thanksgiving too.
[41:43.140 --> 41:43.680]  Oh boy.
[41:43.760 --> 41:47.440]  I ate so much at the, I had, oh, I went insane mode on Thanksgiving.
[41:48.020 --> 41:48.420]  And, uh.
[41:48.420 --> 41:54.640]  You got so lucky that you didn't have to shit while you were circling the runway.
[41:54.920 --> 41:55.440]  That's why.
[41:55.460 --> 41:56.200]  Cause you wouldn't have been able to get up.
[41:56.400 --> 42:00.600]  I think that's, I think that's a very crucial part of the story because they told us while
[42:00.600 --> 42:05.360]  we were flying over the desert, they're like, use the bathroom right now because when we
[42:05.360 --> 42:08.260]  are on the ground taxiing, you cannot get out of your seat.
[42:08.380 --> 42:13.880]  And then looking back, I only missed it by two hours or whatever to like.
[42:14.020 --> 42:14.480]  That's nuts.
[42:14.700 --> 42:14.940]  Yeah.
[42:15.020 --> 42:15.680]  It was bad.
[42:16.000 --> 42:17.760]  It was really, it was really something.
[42:18.140 --> 42:18.480]  Uh.
[42:18.820 --> 42:23.020]  So I don't recommend the poutine at, uh, Haymaker at the airport.
[42:23.020 --> 42:28.400]  I do recommend it at Haymaker or normal Haymaker, but, um, maybe not the, not, maybe not the
[42:28.400 --> 42:28.920]  one at the airport.
[42:28.920 --> 42:33.340]  I can't believe you got food poisoning from poutine because the base poutine is just
[42:33.800 --> 42:35.720]  gravy and cheese curds with fries.
[42:36.060 --> 42:36.300]  Yeah.
[42:36.400 --> 42:39.740]  I have a feeling that something just wasn't cleaned or there was like.
[42:39.740 --> 42:40.140]  I see.
[42:40.300 --> 42:40.560]  Okay.
[42:40.680 --> 42:41.280]  You know what I mean?
[42:41.340 --> 42:45.820]  Like, I have a feeling it was just that, like, there's nothing else that I ate that would
[42:45.820 --> 42:49.180]  have caused me to feel sick.
[42:49.180 --> 42:51.600]  Cause I ate the same stuff at the family thing.
[42:51.740 --> 42:52.900]  And then, I don't know, man, it was.
[42:53.080 --> 42:54.780]  What time were you eating the poutine?
[42:55.160 --> 42:56.100]  Would you, would you say?
[42:56.240 --> 42:57.160]  What time was this flight?
[42:57.160 --> 43:01.180]  Uh, I would say probably like my time.
[43:01.360 --> 43:05.200]  It was probably like one, like Austin time.
[43:05.320 --> 43:06.680]  1.30, something like that.
[43:07.100 --> 43:10.400]  I had poutine the same day at probably 4 p.m.
[43:10.640 --> 43:11.040]  Whoa.
[43:11.460 --> 43:12.920]  I was curious if we were the same.
[43:13.660 --> 43:14.440]  Mine was not poisonous.
[43:14.620 --> 43:15.920]  You guys are poutine brothers.
[43:16.200 --> 43:19.660]  Yeah, man, poutine's a thing where I think it's weird that we don't have it here.
[43:19.940 --> 43:20.400]  It is strange.
[43:20.880 --> 43:24.740]  It seems like, does it not seem like an American food?
[43:24.860 --> 43:25.840]  Like take the name out of it.
[43:25.840 --> 43:27.420]  It's gravy with French fries and cheese.
[43:27.560 --> 43:29.900]  Like it seems like a thing that you would get in the U.S.
[43:30.880 --> 43:34.620]  But take into consideration you got it in the U.S. and it made you sick.
[43:35.300 --> 43:37.720]  Right, but that's like, that's anything.
[43:37.960 --> 43:40.240]  I just, I've had the, I've had the poutine at,
[43:40.500 --> 43:42.120]  I've had the poutine at Haymaker before.
[43:42.220 --> 43:43.880]  Just not that Haymaker at the airport.
[43:44.300 --> 43:45.380]  Eric, I should have given you a heads up.
[43:45.420 --> 43:45.840]  I apologize.
[43:46.060 --> 43:49.100]  That is in response to the 25% tariff thing.
[43:49.260 --> 43:50.080]  We were poisoned.
[43:50.220 --> 43:52.000]  Oh, that makes sense.
[43:52.020 --> 43:52.620]  We are retaliating right now.
[43:52.660 --> 43:52.840]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:53.060 --> 43:54.180]  No, that's smart, actually.
[43:54.180 --> 43:55.980]  I get why Trudeau flew down.
[43:56.080 --> 43:56.580]  I understand.
[43:57.520 --> 43:58.640]  Yeah, the poutine's good now.
[43:58.760 --> 43:59.100]  It's all clear.
[43:59.200 --> 44:00.220]  Yeah, I should have, but I shouldn't have.
[44:00.300 --> 44:01.680]  I just did it on the wrong day.
[44:01.800 --> 44:03.080]  But yeah, I didn't, I really,
[44:03.200 --> 44:04.700]  I didn't know if I was going to tell that story or not.
[44:04.700 --> 44:06.800]  And I figured if I was going to tell it anywhere, it might as well be here.
[44:07.700 --> 44:08.260]  Yeah, absolutely.
[44:08.860 --> 44:10.100]  That could be their new slogan.
[44:10.360 --> 44:11.860]  Poutine, it's a poo thing.
[44:13.300 --> 44:15.620]  I don't think it should be their slogan, but I'm with you.
[44:15.660 --> 44:16.140]  It could be.
[44:16.280 --> 44:17.220]  They could put it on a sign.
[44:17.700 --> 44:18.800]  What if in a couple of weeks,
[44:18.800 --> 44:21.620]  we all just get lunch there and have the poutine and see what happens?
[44:22.160 --> 44:22.440]  Jeez.
[44:22.660 --> 44:23.180]  Oh, okay.
[44:23.180 --> 44:24.300]  Like a Russian roulette.
[44:24.520 --> 44:26.100]  At the airport or the regular one?
[44:26.340 --> 44:26.620]  Airport.
[44:27.400 --> 44:29.980]  So we have to book flights.
[44:30.520 --> 44:32.960]  Well, maybe on our flight to Branson, we'll eat there.
[44:35.260 --> 44:36.140]  Easy as that.
[44:36.420 --> 44:36.940]  I love it.
[44:37.360 --> 44:38.080]  I got a new sign.
[44:38.920 --> 44:39.700]  Oh, what's your new sign?
[44:40.040 --> 44:41.680]  I put it together right now.
[44:42.320 --> 44:45.380]  A little niche, a little specific, but just in case.
[44:45.520 --> 44:46.420]  It would have been helpful.
[44:47.160 --> 44:47.660]  Forgot the turkey.
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.040]  And I assume that would be in the car park
[44:52.040 --> 44:53.380]  on the way out of a double tree.
[44:53.760 --> 44:54.760]  I believe so, yeah.
[44:55.420 --> 44:56.820]  Yeah, that'd be a good place to have it.
[44:57.240 --> 44:58.460]  Maybe the highway out of town.
[44:58.800 --> 45:01.240]  It would be next to the do not back into space sign.
[45:02.280 --> 45:06.040]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[45:06.400 --> 45:09.280]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[45:09.400 --> 45:13.000]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[45:13.360 --> 45:14.860]  Available for a limited time.
[45:15.100 --> 45:17.140]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[45:18.260 --> 45:20.920]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm.
[45:20.920 --> 45:24.560]  Checking off the boxes on your to-do list is a great feeling.
[45:25.000 --> 45:26.780]  And when it comes to checking off coverage,
[45:27.020 --> 45:30.200]  a State Farm agent can help you choose an option that's right for you.
[45:30.380 --> 45:34.680]  Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone, or using the award-winning app,
[45:34.920 --> 45:38.380]  it's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[45:38.820 --> 45:40.660]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[45:43.560 --> 45:48.020]  And an episode or two ago, I presented a new game to y'all
[45:48.020 --> 45:49.740]  called Worst Products in the World.
[45:49.740 --> 45:50.540]  Yes.
[45:50.980 --> 45:53.740]  I have another submission for you I'd like to give you guys.
[45:53.820 --> 45:54.100]  Okay.
[45:54.200 --> 45:57.740]  That I found somewhere in Oklahoma at a Walmart, I think.
[45:58.200 --> 46:01.180]  I think this is one of the worst things to ever exist,
[46:01.380 --> 46:02.960]  and I'm happy to share it with you now.
[46:03.100 --> 46:09.120]  It is Cheetos Flamin' Hot Bath Gust Citrus Scented.
[46:09.460 --> 46:13.440]  Have you ever wanted to take a bath with Flamin' Hot Cheetos?
[46:14.060 --> 46:15.100]  Did you buy it?
[46:15.540 --> 46:16.980]  No, I didn't buy it.
[46:16.980 --> 46:17.040]  Why?
[46:17.160 --> 46:18.280]  Oh, you gotta buy these.
[46:18.280 --> 46:21.800]  All right, I'll go back and buy it if I see it again.
[46:22.040 --> 46:23.300]  Okay, hang on, I'm gonna look it up.
[46:23.400 --> 46:24.760]  Cheetos Bath Dust?
[46:25.140 --> 46:26.360]  Yeah, Cheetos Bath Dust.
[46:26.360 --> 46:31.120]  It's a bad product on several levels, because one, you don't want to smell like Cheetos,
[46:31.260 --> 46:35.000]  but also it's citrus scented, which has nothing to do with Flamin' Hot Cheetos.
[46:35.120 --> 46:35.680]  It's not even representative.
[46:35.680 --> 46:37.540]  And it's Flamin' Hot.
[46:37.680 --> 46:39.660]  Which is a weird thing to describe a bathtub.
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.500]  So apparently there's other...
[46:43.100 --> 46:44.180]  There's other ones.
[46:44.180 --> 46:44.980]  Oh, yeah, there you go.
[46:45.380 --> 46:45.800]  Why?
[46:45.920 --> 46:46.700]  Bath dust.
[46:47.280 --> 46:48.120]  Why did they do that?
[46:48.280 --> 46:49.420]  To sell one dollar?
[46:49.900 --> 46:51.320]  I don't understand what it...
[46:51.320 --> 46:52.520]  So you don't eat it?
[46:52.960 --> 46:53.220]  No.
[46:53.700 --> 46:55.160]  The icy one I'm fine with.
[46:55.600 --> 46:56.380]  That's fine.
[46:56.480 --> 46:56.880]  That's whatever.
[46:57.000 --> 46:57.300]  Why?
[46:57.440 --> 46:59.940]  Why was everyone mad about Tide Pods?
[47:00.160 --> 47:01.600]  But it's blue raspberry, Andrew.
[47:01.760 --> 47:02.380]  Like what?
[47:04.980 --> 47:06.580]  I don't recognize them then.
[47:07.300 --> 47:07.600]  Why?
[47:08.260 --> 47:12.620]  So wait, everyone was mad about Tide Pods, but not this stuff?
[47:12.860 --> 47:13.060]  Yeah.
[47:13.260 --> 47:14.580]  This is just food.
[47:14.960 --> 47:15.200]  Yeah.
[47:15.680 --> 47:17.040]  Fruity Pebbles Soap.
[47:17.040 --> 47:19.000]  I mean, fucking come on.
[47:19.160 --> 47:22.000]  To be fair, nobody's eating this as a trend, to my knowledge.
[47:22.280 --> 47:24.760]  I think that would... these would equally be hated
[47:25.440 --> 47:28.740]  if people started eating their Cheetos Flamin' Hot Bath Dust.
[47:31.640 --> 47:32.920]  This is crazy.
[47:33.120 --> 47:34.100]  I swear to God.
[47:34.460 --> 47:35.100]  Oh my God.
[47:35.260 --> 47:36.960]  I'm not even looking for this shit.
[47:37.200 --> 47:40.080]  I just... Emily was buying Christmas Garland and I...
[47:40.080 --> 47:41.840]  It happened to be near where we were getting the Garland.
[47:41.980 --> 47:43.660]  It's just unbelievable.
[47:44.060 --> 47:46.880]  I think this affected my ads because I got an ad for this.
[47:47.040 --> 47:50.500]  But it doesn't sound as bad as the Cheeto Dust.
[47:51.140 --> 47:51.460]  Oh, yeah.
[47:51.680 --> 47:53.340]  Bucket of chicken scented candle.
[47:53.600 --> 47:54.380]  Bucket of chicken candle.
[47:54.760 --> 47:57.520]  Ew, Eric, this was the photo of the...
[47:57.520 --> 47:58.460]  What it looks like.
[47:58.860 --> 48:02.020]  I found a video of this guy dumping it in.
[48:02.620 --> 48:03.960]  Oh my God.
[48:04.180 --> 48:08.460]  It makes... it makes your bathtub look like you're about to cook mac and cheese.
[48:12.320 --> 48:16.120]  Surely you would stand up and it would dye your body on the way out.
[48:18.740 --> 48:20.220]  Wow, this is nuts.
[48:20.340 --> 48:21.820]  I can't believe these are real.
[48:22.040 --> 48:26.080]  We'll have to buy some and all take baths in it and then rate it.
[48:26.920 --> 48:28.700]  Maybe we have to interact with these in some way.
[48:28.820 --> 48:32.980]  Do you think bath dust is like the weapon grade crystal meth version of bath salts?
[48:33.140 --> 48:35.400]  Like it's a escalation of drugs.
[48:36.220 --> 48:40.220]  I can see some people going zombie mode after eating some bath dust Cheetos.
[48:40.480 --> 48:42.160]  Instead of eating a face, they eat the whole head.
[48:42.580 --> 48:45.180]  I think it's a de-escalation of bath salts.
[48:45.320 --> 48:46.740]  I think it's like a lighter version.
[48:47.100 --> 48:48.420]  I think it's like a lighter version.
[48:48.540 --> 48:51.540]  It doesn't get you so zombie insane, but just like medium zombie.
[48:51.540 --> 48:54.020]  It's like the CBD of bath salts.
[48:54.380 --> 48:55.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[48:55.140 --> 48:58.880]  This is the part of bath salts that's actually good for you.
[49:02.180 --> 49:05.780]  I also saw this packet of batteries when I was looking at stuff
[49:05.780 --> 49:09.520]  and I was struck by the brand name, Best Choice.
[49:10.100 --> 49:14.020]  And that got me thinking, do you think we could sell
[49:16.040 --> 49:19.720]  ironically products if we put Worst Choice as the brand name?
[49:20.260 --> 49:21.180]  Yeah, absolutely.
[49:21.440 --> 49:23.300]  Like we were like the shittiest batteries.
[49:23.980 --> 49:24.580]  Worst batteries.
[49:24.960 --> 49:25.640]  Well, we could do that.
[49:25.780 --> 49:28.040]  Once we have enough products in our store, we could have like a
[49:28.560 --> 49:29.660]  weekly Worst Choice.
[49:30.000 --> 49:31.000]  Like the worst product of the week.
[49:31.560 --> 49:32.120]  I love it.
[49:32.180 --> 49:32.760]  Worst of the week.
[49:32.920 --> 49:33.640]  Worst of the week.
[49:33.720 --> 49:34.440]  That's great.
[49:34.820 --> 49:36.740]  And it'd be our worst selling thing.
[49:37.120 --> 49:38.200]  It's our wow item.
[49:38.280 --> 49:39.220]  Our worst of the week.
[49:39.600 --> 49:40.000]  Yeah.
[49:41.140 --> 49:41.540]  Wow.
[49:41.700 --> 49:42.520]  Worst of the week.
[49:42.520 --> 49:45.640]  Yeah, and it's just a discount on shit we can't sell properly.
[49:46.240 --> 49:50.240]  You said the Best Choice thing and I'm like, don't they make mayonnaise?
[49:50.580 --> 49:51.100]  And they do.
[49:51.420 --> 49:53.560]  Best Choice makes mayonnaise and batteries.
[49:54.640 --> 49:57.100]  I'm sure they make everything because they're the best choice.
[50:00.680 --> 50:02.860]  Oh man, I mixed up my Best Choice stuff.
[50:03.400 --> 50:05.580]  I have a bunch of batteries on my sandwich.
[50:05.680 --> 50:07.500]  Just for fun, here's a picture of Emily and I in the Titanic.
[50:08.820 --> 50:10.360]  They have the jewel.
[50:14.760 --> 50:15.720]  Oh my god.
[50:16.740 --> 50:18.140]  Oh, that's really...
[50:18.140 --> 50:19.180]  Did Emily live or did she die?
[50:19.820 --> 50:20.700]  She died.
[50:22.200 --> 50:23.080]  Yeah, everybody...
[50:23.080 --> 50:23.980]  My mom lived.
[50:24.980 --> 50:26.600]  My mom lived and I can't...
[50:26.600 --> 50:27.140]  I think that's it.
[50:27.680 --> 50:28.540]  I think everybody else died.
[50:29.040 --> 50:30.100]  No, Emily lived.
[50:30.400 --> 50:31.960]  Emily and her fucking kids lived.
[50:32.000 --> 50:32.480]  That's right.
[50:32.740 --> 50:33.720]  Yeah, she and my mom lived.
[50:33.760 --> 50:34.440]  Everybody else died.
[50:34.940 --> 50:35.080]  What?
[50:35.160 --> 50:35.900]  Yeah, it's not.
[50:36.020 --> 50:36.760]  Or did she die?
[50:37.320 --> 50:38.180]  I don't know.
[50:38.180 --> 50:38.660]  Who can remember?
[50:38.960 --> 50:39.420]  I'm dead.
[50:39.440 --> 50:39.800]  What's it matter?
[50:44.480 --> 50:45.940]  Anyway, I love this.
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.740]  We now have WOW items that...
[50:48.740 --> 50:50.760]  We just need more than two products in the store.
[50:51.220 --> 50:53.780]  Speaking of WOW, we sold the Gerpla.
[50:54.460 --> 50:54.880]  Oh, wow.
[50:55.780 --> 50:56.440]  Yeah, we did.
[50:57.500 --> 50:58.240]  That's right.
[50:58.440 --> 51:00.180]  That happened between recordings.
[51:00.920 --> 51:03.860]  We sold 4,000 in...
[51:03.860 --> 51:04.220]  Four minutes?
[51:05.040 --> 51:05.380]  Yeah.
[51:05.540 --> 51:08.120]  Giving us a 1,000 GPM rate.
[51:08.260 --> 51:09.180]  Yes, that is...
[51:09.180 --> 51:11.040]  We are currently at 1,000 GPM.
[51:11.040 --> 51:12.540]  I was trying to...
[51:12.540 --> 51:13.500]  I realized...
[51:13.500 --> 51:15.080]  I was asking Jeff some dopey questions.
[51:15.180 --> 51:18.560]  I was like, so what does the graph look like?
[51:18.600 --> 51:20.840]  Was it like a bell curve or was it like continually going up?
[51:20.900 --> 51:22.840]  And I realized we're trying to get data from...
[51:22.840 --> 51:26.120]  What I assume is four dots over four minutes.
[51:26.460 --> 51:28.240]  Like, I don't know how you could get any useful...
[51:29.340 --> 51:32.620]  I don't know if it updates fast enough to get any usable data from that.
[51:33.040 --> 51:34.240]  I sent him what I had.
[51:35.080 --> 51:37.640]  Uh, yeah, well, to...
[51:39.460 --> 51:40.500]  Unbelievable response.
[51:42.100 --> 51:46.320]  Can't state enough how gratified we are that they sold and they sold so quickly.
[51:48.980 --> 51:53.860]  Cannot tell you how relieved I am that the store stayed up and that they were...
[51:53.860 --> 51:56.220]  They, that day, started shipping product out.
[51:56.460 --> 51:59.880]  And most people, I think, have received their Gerplers at this point.
[51:59.880 --> 52:05.500]  And it seems like mechanically everything worked and like a charm, which...
[52:05.500 --> 52:12.620]  And I think you told us that a huge, huge percentage just ordered like one.
[52:13.100 --> 52:15.220]  Yeah, almost everybody just ordered one.
[52:15.400 --> 52:17.080]  Yeah, there were a bunch of people...
[52:17.080 --> 52:18.880]  Not a bunch, but people ordered two.
[52:19.080 --> 52:22.620]  And there were, you know, one or two people here or there that ordered a few more.
[52:22.740 --> 52:25.000]  But almost every order was a single order.
[52:25.160 --> 52:26.240]  Yeah, people were very respectful.
[52:26.380 --> 52:27.260]  People were very cool.
[52:27.260 --> 52:31.620]  All of you comment leavers out there and regulation listeners were awesome
[52:32.220 --> 52:37.840]  and very respectful for each other and made sure that as many people as possible could get them.
[52:38.400 --> 52:40.840]  Clearly, we were hoping to sell them all.
[52:41.200 --> 52:43.840]  Yes, we were blown away by how quickly they were sold out.
[52:44.980 --> 52:48.900]  Yes, we probably should have expected it more than we did.
[52:49.400 --> 52:54.620]  And to that end, we have ordered 5,000 more Gerplers.
[52:54.740 --> 52:56.180]  They will be here early February.
[52:56.180 --> 52:57.360]  We will put them on sale.
[52:58.100 --> 53:00.160]  We will see how long it takes to go through those.
[53:00.560 --> 53:04.320]  And if you've already bought one in the first 4,000, then you don't need one of these.
[53:04.360 --> 53:07.060]  These are the same damn Gerplers, same color, same everything.
[53:07.480 --> 53:11.640]  So hopefully everybody who didn't get one this time will be able to get one in the next drop
[53:11.640 --> 53:12.540]  in early February.
[53:12.740 --> 53:17.760]  And then between these two orders, maybe we'll figure out what the actual demand is
[53:17.760 --> 53:21.620]  so that the next Gerpler drop we can meet it 100% or close.
[53:22.220 --> 53:23.000]  I like it.
[53:23.000 --> 53:27.480]  Thanks to these sales, we can afford to buy more Gerps up front.
[53:27.700 --> 53:29.240]  Yes, absolutely.
[53:30.340 --> 53:30.660]  Absolutely.
[53:31.200 --> 53:36.300]  And so, yeah, but hopefully by the end of February, we'll have it fucking figured out
[53:36.300 --> 53:39.920]  and we'll know, hey, we're going to, you know, here's the new, I don't know,
[53:40.040 --> 53:42.000]  electric blue Gerpler coming out in summer.
[53:42.200 --> 53:46.380]  We'll order, you know, 8,300 and we'll know that's the exact number we need or whatever.
[53:47.780 --> 53:48.480]  Can't wait.
[53:49.180 --> 53:50.420]  Electric blue Gerpler.
[53:50.420 --> 53:51.400]  Electric blue.
[53:51.520 --> 53:52.840]  Is that a wow product?
[53:53.080 --> 53:54.080]  That just came to my mind.
[53:54.180 --> 53:55.040]  Actually, I want to do it.
[53:55.140 --> 53:56.900]  It's going to be electric blue.
[53:56.920 --> 53:58.660]  Gerpler is going to be the worst of the week.
[53:58.860 --> 54:02.060]  It's just like it has like it should have like a lightning strike on it.
[54:03.540 --> 54:04.260]  All right.
[54:04.840 --> 54:06.220]  OK, now I'm into it.
[54:06.380 --> 54:11.240]  What if we did a series of Gerps where it starts as it starts as purple Gerps
[54:11.240 --> 54:17.120]  and then as they make more, they just change the color of the extrusion over time.
[54:17.120 --> 54:21.260]  And then eventually we'll have just like a 5000 GERP gradient of purple to green.
[54:21.580 --> 54:25.240]  Oh, it's like this giant ombre that's across the entire stock.
[54:25.300 --> 54:26.160]  I love that idea.
[54:26.400 --> 54:29.840]  And then if you get one that's more green, it's like, oh, this is at the end of the GERP line.
[54:30.280 --> 54:31.280]  I like this idea a lot.
[54:31.280 --> 54:36.480]  But I want to send you to a factory somewhere and explain your premise to them.
[54:37.460 --> 54:39.680]  I want you to talk to the people that have to execute.
[54:39.780 --> 54:43.520]  They have to pour in a bunch of plastic pellets or something and melt it down.
[54:43.740 --> 54:44.160]  Right, right.
[54:44.180 --> 54:45.080]  That is what you assume.
[54:45.220 --> 54:45.500]  Yes.
[54:46.380 --> 54:48.200]  Yeah, you go into their factory and say,
[54:48.420 --> 54:52.520]  where do you store the plastic pellets that I assume you have?
[54:52.540 --> 54:54.500]  And they just slowly add more green in.
[54:54.840 --> 54:55.060]  Yeah.
[54:55.760 --> 54:58.380]  And then you stand over the giant vat.
[54:58.560 --> 54:59.900]  Is that what you're imagining is there?
[54:59.960 --> 55:00.960]  How are they doing this?
[55:00.960 --> 55:03.000]  And they're just pouring it in as they're making it.
[55:03.320 --> 55:07.940]  I would love to go and over oversee the GERPLA manufacturing process with a hard hat and a
[55:07.940 --> 55:08.280]  keyboard.
[55:08.820 --> 55:09.560]  I think you should.
[55:10.000 --> 55:10.460]  That's good.
[55:10.460 --> 55:16.380]  And then you can be on an elevated, you can be above the warehouse, sort of like looking
[55:16.380 --> 55:18.800]  down and you should say, we should do this.
[55:19.040 --> 55:22.200]  And then there's a guy looking up at you that says, who is we?
[55:22.380 --> 55:25.660]  And then it all makes sense.
[55:27.480 --> 55:31.640]  I don't think you were probably part of those conversations, but when we did the
[55:32.260 --> 55:41.320]  GERPLA, the green into like the purple, that was so difficult and like so many conversations
[55:41.320 --> 55:44.160]  to be like, no, it has to be like this color into this color.
[55:44.300 --> 55:49.160]  And they had to like figure out a new method to do what we wanted to do.
[55:49.280 --> 55:50.280]  It was crazy.
[55:50.540 --> 55:51.600]  It was so crazy.
[55:51.920 --> 55:54.200]  How do you say we is you in Chinese?
[55:54.440 --> 55:55.120]  That's good.
[55:55.720 --> 55:59.400]  Guys, if anyone out there speaks Mandarin, please let us know.
[55:59.640 --> 56:00.120]  Thank you.
[56:01.280 --> 56:07.260]  Maybe for the blue shot, because we were experimenting with these before everything
[56:07.260 --> 56:10.540]  collapsed at the previous company that never came out.
[56:10.820 --> 56:16.620]  But we're experimenting in GERPLA tech and we were on the the edge of a glow in the dark
[56:16.620 --> 56:17.020]  GERPLA.
[56:17.780 --> 56:20.020]  Maybe that's what's the blue shot like.
[56:20.040 --> 56:21.160]  It's a blue GERPLA.
[56:21.660 --> 56:23.760]  It looks blue and then at night it glows.
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.420]  Yeah, it was like it was pretty cool.
[56:27.620 --> 56:27.940]  Glow, glow.
[56:28.000 --> 56:28.820]  It was awesome.
[56:29.540 --> 56:35.400]  Yeah, it's like taking some water to bed and then you got like a lump next to your head.
[56:36.280 --> 56:36.680]  Radioactive.
[56:38.600 --> 56:39.520]  Oh, my God.
[56:39.580 --> 56:45.720]  It's like when you look at your grandma's old like kitchenware from the 1920s in a black
[56:45.720 --> 56:50.040]  light and it's fucking bright lime green because it's full of lead or whatever.
[56:50.380 --> 56:52.740]  I have a question for Nick before this episode closes.
[56:53.120 --> 56:54.220]  Oh, I have a question for Nick, too.
[56:54.260 --> 56:54.740]  I'll go after you.
[56:54.740 --> 56:56.360]  OK, mine is.
[56:56.980 --> 56:59.900]  So we did the regulation trail mix where we all submitted a thing.
[57:00.600 --> 57:00.860]  Oh, yeah.
[57:00.980 --> 57:05.020]  I went out on an expedition to put it together for the show because I wasn't sure if that
[57:05.020 --> 57:06.180]  was homework enough for us to do.
[57:06.680 --> 57:12.400]  Went to five different places, including a like a bulk store that just sells the scoop.
[57:12.680 --> 57:14.620]  Like you just go and you scoop whatever you want.
[57:15.020 --> 57:19.280]  There's not a single one of your chips anywhere that I could find.
[57:19.540 --> 57:23.320]  If I wanted an alternative because I would have to have one.
[57:23.700 --> 57:24.500]  What would you pick?
[57:25.960 --> 57:28.540]  Oh, other than the ride ship, I believe is what it was.
[57:28.960 --> 57:29.800]  What about the bake?
[57:29.900 --> 57:31.100]  What about the bagel chip?
[57:31.300 --> 57:31.860]  Is that a good?
[57:32.000 --> 57:32.220]  Bagel chip is good.
[57:32.400 --> 57:34.720]  Yeah, is that a good alternative chip?
[57:34.860 --> 57:39.420]  OK, it's not the best alternative, but it'll do because it's still got that nice crunch
[57:39.420 --> 57:40.060]  to it.
[57:40.060 --> 57:42.100]  OK, so you know, got it.
[57:42.660 --> 57:43.480]  A bagel chip.
[57:43.720 --> 57:46.380]  OK, what is that brand called?
[57:46.560 --> 57:47.860]  Do they not have Gordettos?
[57:48.200 --> 57:48.560]  Gordettos.
[57:48.620 --> 57:50.240]  Can you just get those and take them out like that?
[57:50.960 --> 57:51.760]  Oh, damn.
[57:52.240 --> 57:52.580]  Oh, wow.
[57:52.600 --> 57:53.100]  That's crazy.
[57:53.100 --> 57:56.060]  Did we ever get Gracie's alternate pick after she picked Nick's thing?
[57:56.600 --> 57:58.240]  Yes, they were the pretzel twist things.
[57:58.460 --> 57:58.900]  Oh, yeah.
[57:59.020 --> 58:00.360]  I was able to get those.
[58:01.300 --> 58:05.380]  Which is funny, because like when you made that picnic, I was like, I'm aware of those,
[58:05.420 --> 58:07.080]  but I never like see them around.
[58:08.080 --> 58:12.340]  And then I was looking at maybe you guys are talking about how like how much people love
[58:12.340 --> 58:12.660]  those.
[58:13.200 --> 58:14.040]  I thought, interesting.
[58:14.200 --> 58:16.840]  It's not a thing I see.
[58:17.140 --> 58:18.700]  So did you make the rest of the mix?
[58:18.880 --> 58:19.320]  I do.
[58:19.440 --> 58:22.760]  Yeah, I have everything bagged up right now outside of Nick's.
[58:22.760 --> 58:27.400]  I just wanted to get Nick's alternative to get this mix fully going.
[58:28.240 --> 58:32.680]  Because they make they specifically make, yeah, the rye chips only from the Gordettos.
[58:32.840 --> 58:35.460]  So that's interesting that you can't find a special request.
[58:36.580 --> 58:37.780]  That's a garlic one.
[58:38.760 --> 58:41.240]  Put some garlic on this Gordetto.
[58:44.730 --> 58:49.610]  Put it use your plastic pellets and add some garlic to the Gordetto.
[58:50.070 --> 58:53.130]  That sounds less like a special request and more like a special demand.
[58:53.850 --> 58:54.150]  What?
[58:54.250 --> 58:54.730]  Oh, yeah.
[58:54.990 --> 58:56.910]  What accent are you doing?
[58:57.050 --> 59:03.890]  I'm the fanciest man in the land and I want some garlic on my Gordetto.
[59:04.090 --> 59:05.250]  God damn it.
[59:06.710 --> 59:08.530]  That's Andrew's like top hat mode.
[59:08.790 --> 59:10.030]  That is my top hat.
[59:10.130 --> 59:11.850]  Yes, it is indeed.
[59:13.430 --> 59:16.610]  Is that is that's that's what Johnny Caviar sounds like?
[59:16.830 --> 59:17.030]  No.
[59:17.770 --> 59:18.010]  No.
[59:18.630 --> 59:21.210]  Oh, wow.
[59:21.270 --> 59:25.910]  We're coming up on the 100th anniversary of Gordettos in 2032.
[59:25.990 --> 59:29.130]  Oh, the 100th anniversary, you say?
[59:29.490 --> 59:31.150]  Okay, this sucks.
[59:31.430 --> 59:32.790]  Gavin, what was your question for Nick?
[59:33.670 --> 59:37.870]  Oh, I was thinking about Thanksgiving and I was like thinking about all you guys because
[59:37.870 --> 59:41.790]  we were writing some nice stuff to us ourselves, not ourselves, each other in the Slack.
[59:42.110 --> 59:42.570]  We did.
[59:42.690 --> 59:44.730]  We had we wrote nice stuff to each other.
[59:44.790 --> 59:47.390]  And I was thinking, oh, you know, nice little crew.
[59:47.390 --> 59:49.590]  And then I realized I still don't know enough about Nick.
[59:49.770 --> 59:51.110]  Nick, do you have any siblings?
[59:51.710 --> 59:52.370]  I have one brother.
[59:52.590 --> 59:53.330]  He's younger than me.
[59:53.610 --> 59:54.010]  Interesting.
[59:54.170 --> 59:54.750]  Didn't know that.
[59:55.010 --> 59:55.570]  Do you like him?
[59:56.050 --> 59:56.770]  Yeah, I love him.
[59:56.870 --> 59:57.590]  Saw him for Thanksgiving.
[59:57.890 --> 59:58.850]  What's he do for a living?
[59:59.150 --> 59:59.670]  He's a lawyer.
[01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:01.090]  Oh, shit.
[01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:02.010]  Where does he live?
[01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:02.830]  Dallas.
[01:00:03.130 --> 01:00:04.570]  Is he taller or shorter than you?
[01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:05.390]  Taller.
[01:00:06.550 --> 01:00:06.950]  Unfortunately.
[01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:08.270]  Younger and taller?
[01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:08.930]  Yeah.
[01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:10.010]  You like him?
[01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.790]  Interesting.
[01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:11.410]  He's cool.
[01:00:11.610 --> 01:00:13.670]  Did you ever get hand me ups?
[01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:16.170]  No.
[01:00:17.830 --> 01:00:18.590]  Oh, wait, now.
[01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:19.530]  Yeah, actually, probably.
[01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:20.970]  He's like, here's this shirt.
[01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.670]  I'm a lawyer.
[01:00:21.730 --> 01:00:22.370]  I can afford it.
[01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:26.030]  I'm a lawyer.
[01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:27.170]  You think he says that?
[01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:29.530]  I'm a lawyer.
[01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:30.570]  I can afford it.
[01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:32.650]  Dude, that's a direct quote from Thanksgiving.
[01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:33.630]  He said, I'm a lawyer.
[01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:34.430]  I can afford it.
[01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:36.690]  He's handing Nick a box of clothes.
[01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:37.530]  Yeah, at the end.
[01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:39.170]  At the end, he said, you keep the leftovers.
[01:00:39.310 --> 01:00:39.750]  You need it.
[01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:43.290]  Well, you were already boxing him up anyway.
[01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:44.550]  You weren't waiting for permission.
[01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.630]  Boxing him up?
[01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:46.930]  I had already put him in the car.
[01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:51.330]  Oh, man.
[01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:54.750]  Do you, Gavin, do you know about Nick's dog with people eyes?
[01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.910]  Have we talked about that?
[01:00:56.050 --> 01:00:56.370]  Yes.
[01:00:56.610 --> 01:00:57.190]  Sounds familiar.
[01:00:57.570 --> 01:00:58.010]  We have.
[01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.410]  Okay.
[01:00:58.610 --> 01:00:59.190]  Just curious.
[01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:01.390]  I'm just thinking of like more stuff that I know about Nick.
[01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:07.270]  I know that Nick's dog was a human that made a wish to become a dog.
[01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:10.270]  Have we photoshopped the eyes onto a human?
[01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:12.890]  I think we did something like that.
[01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:15.410]  We definitely put them on a picture of Nick.
[01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:16.830]  Oh, that's really good.
[01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:19.630]  Nick, can you post a picture of your dog with human eyes and then a picture?
[01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:22.210]  And then people can post a picture of you with the dog with human eyes.
[01:01:22.290 --> 01:01:22.770]  This is really good.
[01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:23.730]  Oh, God, that's horrific.
[01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:24.730]  But yeah, I'll find it.
[01:01:24.810 --> 01:01:24.930]  Yeah.
[01:01:24.930 --> 01:01:25.550]  Let me get the picture.
[01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:26.030]  Hold on.
[01:01:26.170 --> 01:01:27.070]  Jeff, you've got photoshopped.
[01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:30.090]  Why are you dragging me into this?
[01:01:30.330 --> 01:01:31.470]  Well, I don't have photoshop.
[01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:33.190]  I want the audience to do it.
[01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:33.590]  I want the audience to do it.
[01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:35.050]  No, he's not dragging you in, Jeff.
[01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:36.230]  He's saying we should do this.
[01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:38.070]  Oh, we is me.
[01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:38.730]  Got it.
[01:01:39.310 --> 01:01:40.030]  Oh, no.
[01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:41.170]  He's up above you.
[01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:42.350]  You're on the warehouse floor.
[01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:42.870]  Yeah.
[01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:44.670]  And, uh, get to it.
[01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:45.830]  Taking notes.
[01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:50.850]  Change the pellets in the photoshop gun and just get to it.
[01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:51.310]  No, no, no.
[01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:53.350]  Throw them counterclockwise.
[01:01:53.590 --> 01:01:56.750]  Put them in counterclockwise to get the effect.
[01:01:58.630 --> 01:02:00.230]  Actually, that's more than what Gavin would say.
[01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:02.070]  Gavin would say color ain't right.
[01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:03.410]  That'd be Gavin's effect.
[01:02:04.690 --> 01:02:06.830]  Why would I say that if I'm not overseeing it?
[01:02:07.530 --> 01:02:09.730]  I'm not walking over them halfway through it.
[01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:11.370]  That's exactly what he would do.
[01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:12.370]  He'd just go, no.
[01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:14.830]  That might be how I start it.
[01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:18.410]  Like, what's the problem?
[01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:19.230]  The color ain't right.
[01:02:19.810 --> 01:02:20.670]  How are we going to fix it?
[01:02:22.790 --> 01:02:25.650]  Well, that's what that's exactly what happened with the black Gerpler.
[01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:27.530]  The first one came out kind of green.
[01:02:28.330 --> 01:02:29.290]  And what did we say?
[01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:30.770]  Yeah, we said color ain't right.
[01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:34.550]  Yeah, but we're not there in the factory to give instruction on how to fix it.
[01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:38.090]  But we didn't just send an email back that said color ain't right.
[01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:43.250]  That might be the subject of the email, though.
[01:02:48.690 --> 01:02:49.410]  Oh, man.
[01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:49.670]  All right.
[01:02:49.690 --> 01:02:50.770]  We got to wrap this one up, guys.
[01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:52.150]  We got to go.
[01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:53.390]  We have to end this thing.
[01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:54.750]  Oh, but I've missed you a lot.
[01:02:54.850 --> 01:02:59.570]  Yeah, but we're going to get together and we're going to, at the time of this recording,
[01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:04.450]  we're going to film the end of our advent calendar stuff very soon.
[01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:09.570]  So if you want to check out every day, a new regulation video,
[01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:12.170]  you can go to patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:15.450]  And this is free on Patreon.
[01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:18.450]  It is free on Patreon.
[01:03:18.790 --> 01:03:23.810]  You just go there on Patreon, just become a member, become a free member,
[01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:29.430]  and then watch the videos every day of us opening a different advent gift from Andrew,
[01:03:29.650 --> 01:03:32.150]  which is such a fun idea.
[01:03:32.490 --> 01:03:34.710]  It's the worst picture you could have posted of your dog.
[01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:35.890]  How are we going to get the eyes for that?
[01:03:35.890 --> 01:03:37.710]  Like, I mean, just...
[01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:39.770]  What the fuck are they supposed to do?
[01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:41.350]  That's the only one I have.
[01:03:41.410 --> 01:03:42.090]  That's the only one I have.
[01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:44.910]  Then just don't post it.
[01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:47.650]  That's like Gracie's hand in the bath.
[01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:48.470]  It is.
[01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:51.910]  Well, don't take it down now.
[01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:53.410]  The audience needs to see it.
[01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:56.910]  You posted a picture of a brown dog on brown carpet.
[01:03:57.350 --> 01:04:00.130]  I will say, though, if I had to fall down a flight of stairs,
[01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:00.930]  I'm picking that one.
[01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.770]  That looks deluxe.
[01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:04.210]  It's a very plush place.
[01:04:04.330 --> 01:04:04.890]  It's pretty good.
[01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:09.410]  Dude, and you would fall down the flight of stairs because you'd trip over that dog laying there
[01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:11.830]  because you can't see him because he's the same color as the carpet.
[01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:14.350]  Like a trip to repair floating eyes.
[01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:15.210]  Here you go, Nick.
[01:04:15.210 --> 01:04:15.610]  Don't worry.
[01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:16.150]  I got you.
[01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:17.410]  You do?
[01:04:17.650 --> 01:04:17.850]  Ow.
[01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:19.310]  Oh my God.
[01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:20.270]  Oh, you son of a bitch.
[01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:26.190]  Nick photoshopped, photoshopped a Padres hat,
[01:04:26.810 --> 01:04:31.530]  photoshopped a Padres hat on Nick's dog that has human eyes.
[01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:35.530]  I didn't even register to me as a photoshopped Padres hat.
[01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:37.770]  I just was like, Nick's dog likes the Padres.
[01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:39.470]  Nick's... I agree.
[01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:41.630]  Nick's dog likes the Padres.
[01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:43.630]  We should put that on a sign.
[01:04:44.170 --> 01:04:46.570]  That's OK.
[01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:48.230]  That's the new stop sign.
[01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:50.490]  I'll save it for next time.
[01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:55.290]  I had a, uh, I had a moment of like, it was the perfect.
[01:04:55.710 --> 01:05:00.450]  I just am willing to go with the flow on too many, like on too extreme of a line.
[01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:01.070]  Oh, I love these.
[01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:03.790]  I, yeah, I should probably save it.
[01:05:03.810 --> 01:05:06.810]  It's not a long story, but you only just said, do we have time?
[01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:08.150]  Just just do it.
[01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:08.790]  Just OK.
[01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:10.050]  I was on TikTok.
[01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:14.390]  I was scrolling and I'm someone who when I see something about like if someone's like,
[01:05:14.570 --> 01:05:16.970]  hey, I'm this or whatever, it's just like, OK, whatever.
[01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:17.590]  I don't care.
[01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:18.270]  It's fine.
[01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:21.030]  What? And it was a person.
[01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:27.910]  It was a news story about someone who is an 18 year old who is a has been like.
[01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:35.650]  Established as a reincarnated llama is what it said, and it was about the Dalai Lama.
[01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.870]  But I didn't.
[01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:39.050]  I interpreted it as a literal llama.
[01:05:39.550 --> 01:05:41.070]  So I loaded in.
[01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:42.130]  I was like, what this?
[01:05:42.450 --> 01:05:45.310]  Wait, and this you can just be an animal in a past life.
[01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:47.350]  And they've determined this is a wild story.
[01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:50.210]  So I'm watching it, waiting for it to expand.
[01:05:50.330 --> 01:05:52.470]  And they interview this 18 year old kid.
[01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:56.090]  And he's like, yeah, you know, it's it's a pretty unorthodox life.
[01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:57.130]  You know, I got a lot to learn.
[01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:58.630]  That's more than just going to college.
[01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:01.050]  And my brain went, yeah, you're a fucking llama.
[01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:02.250]  And you're fast like you got.
[01:06:02.370 --> 01:06:04.290]  You don't even know how to do any people's stuff.
[01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:06.310]  This is a whole thing for you.
[01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:09.410]  And then then they immediately went, yeah, the Dalai Lama.
[01:06:09.650 --> 01:06:11.190]  And I went, oh, fuck.
[01:06:11.410 --> 01:06:16.230]  Oh, no, this is just he's a past person who was a llama.
