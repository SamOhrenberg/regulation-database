[00:00.000 --> 00:04.780]  Gatorade is the number one proven electrolyte blend designed to hydrate better than water.
[00:06.540 --> 00:14.500]  So you can lose more sweat and raise your game. Gatorade. Is it in you?
[00:15.040 --> 00:20.860]  Hello and welcome to the Olympics. It's time for the Olympics. It's a big event. I don't know if
[00:20.860 --> 00:27.040]  you've heard of it. Happens every four years. Welcome to the Olympics. Welcome to the Olympics.
[00:27.040 --> 00:33.060]  Is there one this year? No, there wasn't. There was one. Wasn't there a weird one?
[00:33.480 --> 00:37.740]  Wasn't it like two years ago because of COVID? There's three years of the Olympics every two
[00:37.740 --> 00:41.100]  years because of the winter and summer. Yeah, but this is the Summer Olympics.
[00:41.500 --> 00:44.280]  If this is the Olympics, we got it on Wish.com.
[00:44.900 --> 00:48.940]  Oh, I cooked up a team of Olympics for you. You get ready.
[00:52.160 --> 00:56.200]  We're looking at a sheet right now of a bunch of things. It's a big event
[00:56.200 --> 01:00.820]  and I feel like it's fun when we have ways to engage with things that are happening,
[01:00.980 --> 01:07.420]  much like the Summer Movie League. So this is something I did last Summer Olympics.
[01:08.160 --> 01:13.320]  If you may notice on the left of the screen, you have a country and then you have a number.
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.060]  We are going to go over-unders on gold medal predictions for each of these countries.
[01:20.520 --> 01:24.960]  Oh, I like this. And we will see at the end of it who gets the most right.
[01:24.960 --> 01:28.380]  Now, where did you get these betting lines from? Is this official?
[01:29.080 --> 01:33.540]  So some of these are official. Some of these are just like statistical previews.
[01:33.580 --> 01:36.920]  It was tough to get betting lines for every country.
[01:37.340 --> 01:42.240]  And now there are, to my knowledge, 206 countries and then the refugee team
[01:42.240 --> 01:45.380]  competing in the Olympics. But I don't see 206 countries.
[01:45.620 --> 01:52.200]  No, that felt like it would be way too long. A lot of countries are predicted to win like
[01:52.200 --> 01:56.620]  one medal, maybe one gold, maybe. Yeah. So just it felt like a waste of space.
[01:56.960 --> 02:01.360]  We got Eswatini. That's, you know, next time.
[02:01.620 --> 02:05.680]  And four years from now, Eswatini is going to be all over this.
[02:05.820 --> 02:09.760]  So are you saying this is the cream of the country crop, as it were?
[02:10.440 --> 02:16.580]  It is the ones that were available and then ones that were not impossible to find info on.
[02:16.880 --> 02:20.560]  OK, so surprisingly difficult to find lines on a lot of countries.
[02:20.560 --> 02:23.780]  One would assume that only the cream of the crop would be readily available.
[02:24.020 --> 02:26.360]  So for the rest of the countries, you're less.
[02:26.660 --> 02:30.260]  According to Andrew and the Olympic Committee and betting lines,
[02:30.300 --> 02:33.220]  you're less significant is what they're saying, not I.
[02:34.040 --> 02:39.100]  So what we're doing here is we're going over under and that's cumulative medals, right?
[02:39.140 --> 02:41.820]  It's like gold, silver and bronze all put together.
[02:42.380 --> 02:44.620]  Yeah, sorry, this is specifically gold medals.
[02:45.260 --> 02:49.520]  Oh, OK. So definitely not what I thought we were doing.
[02:49.520 --> 02:52.160]  OK, whoa.
[02:52.740 --> 02:58.060]  I did mention it earlier, may have got lost in Swahili or whatever you said, Gavin.
[02:59.380 --> 03:08.280]  OK, so so we're taking the line of over under and we have the an egg order because it doesn't
[03:08.280 --> 03:09.620]  necessarily matter.
[03:10.040 --> 03:11.240]  No, not like what order are we going?
[03:11.380 --> 03:14.000]  But because I'd like to keep this.
[03:15.300 --> 03:18.560]  Like, I don't want Andrew to influence everyone the whole time.
[03:18.560 --> 03:20.920]  Just in case I can.
[03:21.160 --> 03:23.340]  I propose that we go in a step order.
[03:23.480 --> 03:24.160]  So Andrew would.
[03:24.300 --> 03:25.560]  So we're going in a order.
[03:26.780 --> 03:28.780]  It's it's an egg order for the first one.
[03:28.920 --> 03:33.500]  The second one would start with Nick Nick and then go and then go around.
[03:33.600 --> 03:36.520]  So we're doing like kind of a step down every time.
[03:36.520 --> 03:37.400]  So the third one's me.
[03:37.480 --> 03:38.200]  The fourth one's Jeff.
[03:38.280 --> 03:38.860]  The last one's Gavin.
[03:38.900 --> 03:40.560]  And then back to Andrew for the sixth one.
[03:40.860 --> 03:42.220]  And we just kind of keep going around that way.
[03:42.240 --> 03:45.320]  It's not influencing it like it's not Andrew every time going first.
[03:45.320 --> 03:49.980]  We I got psycho brain because you said the step thing and I immediately got it.
[03:50.040 --> 03:51.800]  I did not need an explanation at all.
[03:51.840 --> 03:52.620]  Wow, really?
[03:52.940 --> 03:53.460]  Oh, that's great.
[03:53.680 --> 03:54.160]  Immediately.
[03:54.500 --> 03:55.400]  Yeah, it's fantastic.
[03:55.880 --> 03:56.560]  It's cool stepping.
[03:57.120 --> 03:57.600]  Great.
[03:57.900 --> 03:59.180]  I think that's fantastic.
[03:59.840 --> 04:03.040]  Yeah, you say it's pretty clear, but Nick was over here going, what?
[04:03.220 --> 04:06.080]  Yeah, yeah, that's that's why I explained it.
[04:06.640 --> 04:12.260]  OK, so, Gavin, do you have any questions before we get started?
[04:12.600 --> 04:13.800]  That's that's thank you.
[04:13.800 --> 04:15.220]  That's exactly what's going to go next.
[04:16.140 --> 04:17.800]  So you see, there's a number, Gavin.
[04:18.220 --> 04:18.960]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:19.080 --> 04:23.120]  Before we, Gavin, can I I have a question I'd like to jump in.
[04:23.380 --> 04:25.700]  Do you understand what we're about to do, Gavin?
[04:26.320 --> 04:26.600]  No.
[04:28.360 --> 04:30.540]  I really thought this one was easy.
[04:30.840 --> 04:35.680]  Well, I just say if I think the USA are going to get over or under 41.5.
[04:36.180 --> 04:36.640]  That's right.
[04:37.000 --> 04:37.100]  Gold medals.
[04:37.380 --> 04:38.220]  Gold is correct.
[04:38.600 --> 04:39.960]  Gold, gold medals.
[04:40.140 --> 04:40.360]  Medals.
[04:40.440 --> 04:41.260]  You do understand.
[04:41.540 --> 04:42.260]  I guess I do get it.
[04:42.340 --> 04:42.880]  You got it.
[04:43.500 --> 04:44.340]  That's great.
[04:44.340 --> 04:48.740]  Whoever gets the most right at the end of this will win an Olympic prize.
[04:48.980 --> 04:51.020]  Oh, I think I think we should.
[04:51.140 --> 04:52.200]  I think somebody should win a medal.
[04:52.700 --> 04:53.440]  Yeah, absolutely.
[04:53.660 --> 04:55.900]  Or a medal adjacent thing of some kind.
[04:56.220 --> 04:57.180]  Oh, I like that.
[04:57.240 --> 04:58.380]  OK, metal chocolate.
[04:58.880 --> 05:00.500]  Maybe not a medal, maybe a plastic.
[05:01.160 --> 05:02.460]  Maybe Medal of Honor.
[05:02.880 --> 05:03.720]  Who knows?
[05:04.020 --> 05:05.140]  Medal of Honor on PS1?
[05:07.040 --> 05:09.940]  Maybe, maybe PS2, maybe 360.
[05:10.360 --> 05:11.040]  They went crazy.
[05:11.440 --> 05:13.520]  Can you believe they made a 360 Medal of Honor?
[05:13.700 --> 05:14.600]  They really got that.
[05:14.700 --> 05:17.100]  That franchise really got killed by Call of Duty.
[05:17.200 --> 05:18.100]  Oh, yeah, it did.
[05:18.780 --> 05:21.060]  Oh, top of the food chain for about five years there.
[05:21.140 --> 05:23.020]  And then Call of Duty just shit right down their mouths.
[05:23.160 --> 05:26.600]  But wasn't wasn't Medal of Honor wasn't like the Call of Duty team,
[05:26.640 --> 05:28.080]  like the original Medal of Honor team?
[05:28.300 --> 05:28.860]  I think so.
[05:28.860 --> 05:30.720]  Like they left and went to Activision or something.
[05:31.260 --> 05:33.400]  Yeah, because I think when they started Call of Duty,
[05:33.400 --> 05:35.020]  they called it like the Medal of Honor killer.
[05:35.300 --> 05:36.820]  It was like, oh, Jesus Christ.
[05:36.960 --> 05:38.000]  Oh, and it was.
[05:38.520 --> 05:40.380]  Yeah, well, it's because back then,
[05:40.380 --> 05:42.500]  especially because things were a little bit more, you know,
[05:42.760 --> 05:45.420]  not PC, but you just you couldn't say some stuff in media.
[05:45.560 --> 05:45.740]  Yeah.
[05:45.880 --> 05:50.060]  Like they couldn't put in a Nintendo Power or a PlayStation magazine.
[05:51.600 --> 05:54.220]  We're going to shit down the mouths of Medal of Honor
[05:54.220 --> 05:59.560]  until they choke on our poop and then they die full of poop
[05:59.560 --> 06:01.500]  in their throat, in esophagus.
[06:02.120 --> 06:02.600]  That's cool.
[06:02.800 --> 06:04.960]  So they breathed poop and choked on poop.
[06:05.400 --> 06:05.520]  Oh, yeah.
[06:05.640 --> 06:06.660]  All right, Gavin.
[06:06.820 --> 06:08.160]  So you do know what we're doing, right, Gavin?
[06:08.760 --> 06:09.000]  Yeah.
[06:09.000 --> 06:10.040]  OK, great.
[06:10.240 --> 06:12.140]  Let's begin with Andrew.
[06:12.320 --> 06:15.920]  Andrew, we have a line of 41 and a half gold medals
[06:16.420 --> 06:18.060]  for the United States of America.
[06:18.240 --> 06:20.040]  Will you be taking the over or the under?
[06:21.000 --> 06:23.320]  Oh, this is a this is an easy call for me.
[06:23.960 --> 06:25.860]  People are fucking up the USA.
[06:26.180 --> 06:27.540]  USA is going to have a bad year.
[06:27.720 --> 06:28.720]  I can feel it in my bones.
[06:29.720 --> 06:33.920]  One medal, especially they're not going to get that basketball gold.
[06:34.040 --> 06:35.240]  That's going to Canada this year.
[06:35.340 --> 06:38.000]  I'm taking the under on the 41.5.
[06:39.020 --> 06:40.420]  Canada plays basketball.
[06:40.960 --> 06:43.040]  Oh, you're talking all this shit.
[06:43.140 --> 06:45.220]  Canada's got the second best team.
[06:45.480 --> 06:50.160]  America was two points away from losing to whatever nation Gavin said 10 minutes ago.
[06:50.880 --> 06:57.220]  If you if you play on the Toronto Raptors, are you eligible to be a Canadian?
[06:57.220 --> 06:58.140]  You really should.
[06:58.760 --> 07:02.240]  They revoked all U.S. passports for the Raptors players
[07:02.240 --> 07:04.460]  and told them they couldn't go back to the States until they played for Canada.
[07:04.900 --> 07:05.180]  Smart.
[07:07.040 --> 07:08.980]  Nick, over under 41.5.
[07:09.180 --> 07:10.260]  Just for that, I'm going over.
[07:10.860 --> 07:11.680]  Basketball alone.
[07:12.000 --> 07:12.720]  Patriot over here.
[07:12.920 --> 07:16.440]  I'm absolutely, I'm absolutely taking the over as well.
[07:16.660 --> 07:17.740]  Like, no doubt.
[07:17.920 --> 07:20.360]  USA, strong pride, American exceptionalism.
[07:21.320 --> 07:23.500]  Easiest money today.
[07:24.000 --> 07:24.560]  Take the over.
[07:25.300 --> 07:25.580]  Okay.
[07:26.040 --> 07:29.700]  And let's see, Gavin, over under 41.5.
[07:30.100 --> 07:31.040]  Oh, definitely under.
[07:31.680 --> 07:32.940]  Oh, I had it.
[07:32.980 --> 07:33.880]  That's right, Gavin.
[07:33.880 --> 07:37.660]  I have a feeling the foreigners would have something to say about it.
[07:38.680 --> 07:39.200]  Yeah.
[07:39.520 --> 07:39.780]  Okay.
[07:40.080 --> 07:41.100]  That's that's pretty good.
[07:41.100 --> 07:42.380]  He believes in Team Canada too.
[07:42.960 --> 07:43.440]  He's equally.
[07:43.620 --> 07:44.240]  I don't know about that.
[07:44.900 --> 07:45.680]  I do.
[07:47.080 --> 07:50.200]  So we have two unders and three overs.
[07:50.400 --> 07:52.060]  This is I'm very excited to see.
[07:52.180 --> 07:55.400]  We already have a split and I'm very excited to see how this kind of like keeps going.
[07:56.780 --> 07:57.300]  Okay.
[07:58.360 --> 08:01.300]  Second, China at 34 and a half.
[08:01.500 --> 08:02.720]  Nick, what do you think?
[08:03.880 --> 08:05.820]  I know nothing about the Olympics.
[08:06.280 --> 08:06.560]  Over.
[08:07.620 --> 08:08.140]  Okay.
[08:10.180 --> 08:13.100]  I am also going to take the over.
[08:13.300 --> 08:14.520]  Chinese exceptionalism.
[08:14.720 --> 08:17.960]  I do believe that China is going to have a great year in the Summer Olympics.
[08:18.200 --> 08:18.980]  Stronger than ever.
[08:19.580 --> 08:20.780]  Always bet on red.
[08:20.900 --> 08:22.080]  I take the over on China.
[08:22.340 --> 08:22.720]  Wow.
[08:22.800 --> 08:23.280]  Okay.
[08:23.560 --> 08:23.800]  Okay.
[08:23.880 --> 08:24.920]  Where are the medals made?
[08:26.700 --> 08:28.600]  I think the host nation makes them.
[08:28.960 --> 08:29.460]  Okay.
[08:29.640 --> 08:30.700]  So it's Paris.
[08:31.260 --> 08:34.960]  Yeah, because I know when they were made for the Tokyo Olympics, I know they took
[08:34.960 --> 08:39.220]  the gold was stripped from old like computer parts and like melted down.
[08:39.320 --> 08:40.440]  And that was like a big thing about it.
[08:40.580 --> 08:43.040]  So I think it's whoever the host nation is makes them.
[08:43.160 --> 08:43.600]  Maybe.
[08:44.100 --> 08:44.540]  Under.
[08:46.040 --> 08:46.480]  Under?
[08:47.560 --> 08:48.000]  Listen.
[08:49.180 --> 08:50.060]  And Andrew?
[08:50.280 --> 08:54.980]  I feel like China is under a lot of duress from what I I'm not paying attention to China.
[08:55.180 --> 08:58.880]  I feel like I'm hearing a lot of bad things about China and my peripheral.
[08:58.880 --> 08:59.860]  They're struggling.
[08:59.880 --> 09:00.760]  Maybe not struggling.
[09:01.040 --> 09:03.080]  It just seems like maybe not the greatest times.
[09:03.200 --> 09:05.040]  I don't know, though, because I don't pay attention.
[09:05.480 --> 09:06.920]  That could be completely wrong.
[09:06.920 --> 09:07.440]  I'm going under.
[09:07.560 --> 09:08.400]  What are you talking about?
[09:08.620 --> 09:12.700]  What I just feel like the vibes in China are not great right now.
[09:13.100 --> 09:15.580]  I feel like there's some bad Chinese vibes.
[09:16.020 --> 09:16.720]  And so I'm going under.
[09:16.740 --> 09:17.400]  What are you?
[09:17.860 --> 09:20.900]  Thanks for distance me from all of this.
[09:21.120 --> 09:24.400]  Thanks for giving us a peer into your thought process.
[09:24.720 --> 09:27.220]  I was very clear and that that might be incorrect.
[09:27.220 --> 09:31.440]  But I feel like there's a lot of bad vibes around China at the moment.
[09:31.580 --> 09:33.920]  Well, Andrew is the vibes connoisseur or whatever.
[09:33.980 --> 09:34.840]  He's the vibes guy.
[09:35.000 --> 09:36.220]  He detects vibes.
[09:36.500 --> 09:37.320]  Vibe inspector.
[09:37.660 --> 09:38.780]  Is that what his title was?
[09:38.780 --> 09:40.020]  That was, but you're right.
[09:40.260 --> 09:41.580]  Yeah, we were going to get make t-shirts.
[09:41.820 --> 09:42.320]  Vibe inspector.
[09:42.960 --> 09:45.820]  Was that a few years ago where the people like elections?
[09:45.820 --> 09:46.540]  And I don't know.
[09:46.660 --> 09:47.680]  I don't know what's going on.
[09:47.960 --> 09:50.320]  I just I feel like the vibes might be a little bad.
[09:50.940 --> 09:51.460]  Might be distracting.
[09:51.520 --> 09:54.000]  He's reading the vibe leaves and that's what's coming up.
[09:56.080 --> 09:57.300]  There's something happening.
[09:57.520 --> 09:58.220]  I don't know.
[09:58.480 --> 10:00.180]  Okay, something brewing in China.
[10:00.640 --> 10:03.340]  If you know, and if it's not brewing at the very least,
[10:03.420 --> 10:06.500]  we got some foreign fault solidarity between Gavin and I that I like.
[10:06.800 --> 10:07.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[10:07.620 --> 10:08.880]  Wow, this is some bullshit.
[10:09.740 --> 10:10.380]  There you go.
[10:11.040 --> 10:15.000]  This starts with me at Great Britain, and I don't even have to give a preamble for it under.
[10:15.320 --> 10:16.360]  I mean, like, no.
[10:17.520 --> 10:20.200]  Like, yeah, they finally like they finally voted labor.
[10:20.340 --> 10:22.000]  It took them 14 years or whatever.
[10:22.160 --> 10:23.080]  So like, that's embarrassing.
[10:23.080 --> 10:26.660]  And 14, 14 and a half medals is under.
[10:26.900 --> 10:29.660]  So I'm just I'm going with I'm with a voted labor.
[10:30.080 --> 10:30.680]  Yeah.
[10:31.100 --> 10:35.780]  So the whole country is down in the dumps because it didn't come home.
[10:35.900 --> 10:36.740]  They're not in the right mind.
[10:36.800 --> 10:37.040]  True.
[10:37.360 --> 10:39.140]  When true, I take the under.
[10:39.560 --> 10:42.520]  OK, OK, Gavin, Great Britain.
[10:42.900 --> 10:43.800]  Oh, definitely under.
[10:47.740 --> 10:48.840]  Fucking perfect.
[10:48.980 --> 10:50.280]  Gavin's been under on everything.
[10:50.360 --> 10:50.880]  This rocks.
[10:51.640 --> 10:53.400]  Andrew, over under 14 and a half.
[10:53.480 --> 10:56.440]  You've thrown me for a real loop here because I was ready to go under
[10:56.440 --> 10:57.820]  because it didn't come home.
[10:57.920 --> 11:01.100]  I felt like, as Jeff said, there could be some some negative.
[11:01.280 --> 11:03.400]  But you just told me they voted labor, apparently,
[11:04.060 --> 11:07.660]  which seems like they're into work and working hard at the moment.
[11:09.180 --> 11:12.480]  Gavin, when you hear that, does it really resonate for you?
[11:14.520 --> 11:17.980]  Labor to me implies there's some activity going on.
[11:18.380 --> 11:19.720]  Is that what y'all thought of Brexit?
[11:21.260 --> 11:23.080]  See, Brexit is the opposite.
[11:23.320 --> 11:24.700]  That exit is in it.
[11:24.800 --> 11:25.400]  They're leaving.
[11:25.840 --> 11:28.120]  Right, of course.
[11:28.320 --> 11:32.860]  But labor, when I think labor, I think I'm working hard.
[11:33.120 --> 11:34.300]  This is a tough thing.
[11:34.420 --> 11:36.500]  I'm into getting stuff done.
[11:36.720 --> 11:40.360]  But the training for the Olympics is much longer than one year.
[11:40.760 --> 11:44.200]  Yeah, a lot of the training would have been conservative rule.
[11:44.740 --> 11:46.420]  Yeah, I'm a mental warrior, Gavin.
[11:46.500 --> 11:50.380]  I'm talking about the vibes and the mindset going into these games.
[11:50.880 --> 11:52.860]  I'm taking the over on this because of labor.
[11:52.980 --> 11:54.540]  Wow, you're going with the over.
[11:54.680 --> 11:56.140]  I'm going with the over. They're locked in.
[11:56.440 --> 12:03.800]  Based on the hard-working, nose-to-the-grindstone mentality of the labor party.
[12:04.160 --> 12:05.260]  Well, I don't know there.
[12:05.580 --> 12:07.640]  Listen, I'm not the party I have no clue about.
[12:07.760 --> 12:08.720]  But when I hear labor...
[12:10.940 --> 12:12.120]  Could just be good British.
[12:12.900 --> 12:15.100]  This just became my favorite piece of content.
[12:15.800 --> 12:17.240]  This is crazy.
[12:17.860 --> 12:19.060]  Nick, what do you think?
[12:19.820 --> 12:22.940]  Historically, Britain doesn't do well in France, so they're going under.
[12:23.860 --> 12:26.860]  Oh, wow. I mean, that's pretty accurate.
[12:27.300 --> 12:28.140]  It's pretty accurate.
[12:28.280 --> 12:29.140]  What happened to Britain and France?
[12:29.340 --> 12:32.480]  Well, they lost... how many wars was it? Let's see.
[12:33.960 --> 12:35.360]  There's only two of them.
[12:35.820 --> 12:38.860]  They fought 41, and I think France won 24.
[12:39.140 --> 12:40.780]  Only two wars in all of history?
[12:40.960 --> 12:41.640]  Yeah, only been two.
[12:41.700 --> 12:42.800]  Oh, well, I forgot.
[12:42.860 --> 12:45.000]  Are you thinking of a world war? They were on the same side.
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.920]  Canada's taking the basketball medal, and there's only been two wars.
[12:50.340 --> 12:53.700]  The vibes are weird in China this year, guys.
[13:00.240 --> 13:08.480]  Jeff, speaking of France, France is favored at 24 and a half.
[13:08.640 --> 13:12.940]  What do you think the over-under... again, this is in Paris, so they're in gay paris.
[13:12.940 --> 13:18.820]  I feel like the host nation bump is already factored into the over-under, obviously.
[13:19.460 --> 13:25.460]  But that being said, you just... you cannot discount the benefit of watching a home team
[13:25.460 --> 13:31.820]  play on their home court, or a home athlete perform on his or her home court.
[13:31.900 --> 13:32.660]  So I'm going to take the over.
[13:33.280 --> 13:34.140]  Okay, over.
[13:34.820 --> 13:36.860]  Gavin, how do you feel about the French in general?
[13:37.220 --> 13:40.540]  Well, I was raised to boo at them, so I'm going to go under.
[13:41.220 --> 13:43.340]  They're playing football, I want them to lose.
[13:43.760 --> 13:44.260]  Or tennis.
[13:45.320 --> 13:47.120]  Or... do French people play cricket?
[13:47.420 --> 13:47.880]  I don't know.
[13:50.060 --> 13:51.240]  That's a good question.
[13:51.940 --> 13:52.340]  Andrew!
[13:53.040 --> 13:53.860]  Andrew, the host country.
[13:53.880 --> 13:55.300]  I mean, there's a lot of things to take in.
[13:55.420 --> 13:58.040]  First of all, I know they had an election recently.
[13:58.300 --> 14:01.900]  Does anyone... was the Labour Party involved in that election?
[14:03.100 --> 14:03.880]  Did they win?
[14:05.200 --> 14:05.620]  The... the...
[14:05.620 --> 14:07.680]  I mean, did they have a Labour Party?
[14:07.680 --> 14:08.240]  There was...
[14:10.780 --> 14:12.540]  Politically, the results are very similar.
[14:13.220 --> 14:13.400]  True.
[14:13.480 --> 14:13.680]  Yeah.
[14:13.860 --> 14:14.200]  Okay.
[14:14.760 --> 14:15.100]  Got it.
[14:15.200 --> 14:16.640]  Yeah, so I mean, I guess you can...
[14:17.560 --> 14:18.260]  What is it called?
[14:18.380 --> 14:20.240]  It's like the... it's like the People's...
[14:20.240 --> 14:20.720]  So it's...
[14:23.100 --> 14:23.460]  Whatever.
[14:23.760 --> 14:24.640]  It's... you got it, Andrew.
[14:24.680 --> 14:25.120]  What do you think?
[14:25.180 --> 14:25.780]  I don't care.
[14:25.900 --> 14:27.720]  I'm thinking, well, macaroon.
[14:28.080 --> 14:32.540]  It makes me think of the treat, which I always enjoy.
[14:32.860 --> 14:33.220]  Right.
[14:33.820 --> 14:35.260]  But there's political unrest.
[14:35.420 --> 14:36.440]  But then they had an election.
[14:36.440 --> 14:39.220]  From my understanding, they were like, oh, it's doing immediate...
[14:39.220 --> 14:39.760]  Who cares?
[14:39.840 --> 14:40.260]  Nobody cares.
[14:41.240 --> 14:44.480]  I'm surprised the French are good at this many things, to be honest.
[14:44.960 --> 14:47.200]  I don't think of them as like an all-around...
[14:47.200 --> 14:48.380]  We're doing a lot of good stuff.
[14:48.800 --> 14:49.360]  Not necessarily.
[14:49.480 --> 14:50.680]  That's athletics.
[14:51.680 --> 14:52.080]  What?
[14:52.940 --> 14:53.340]  20...
[14:54.820 --> 14:56.080]  I'm gonna take...
[14:57.600 --> 14:58.740]  What's my read on this?
[14:59.040 --> 14:59.680]  I'm going over.
[15:00.260 --> 15:00.660]  Over.
[15:01.100 --> 15:01.360]  Okay.
[15:01.680 --> 15:02.980]  Yeah, host nation, as you said.
[15:03.580 --> 15:03.780]  Yep.
[15:03.980 --> 15:04.520]  Nick, what do you think?
[15:04.520 --> 15:05.820]  Home field advantage.
[15:05.960 --> 15:08.080]  And I'm just going with the signs.
[15:08.200 --> 15:09.280]  I had French fries this week.
[15:09.300 --> 15:10.220]  So over.
[15:11.000 --> 15:11.840]  Jesus Christ.
[15:12.200 --> 15:17.300]  Well, I can say that you guys are vastly overestimating the home field advantage,
[15:17.300 --> 15:20.240]  as nobody hates the French more than the French.
[15:20.280 --> 15:26.640]  They have conspired to all shit and toilets at the same time to flood the river with shit.
[15:27.100 --> 15:29.320]  They do not care whether they win or lose.
[15:29.360 --> 15:31.840]  They don't want you speaking their language to them.
[15:31.840 --> 15:34.860]  And for those reasons, I have to give France the under.
[15:35.140 --> 15:40.320]  I think that they're smoking cigarettes and their laissez-faire attitude will not
[15:40.320 --> 15:43.060]  lead them to over 24 and a half.
[15:43.180 --> 15:43.960]  So 25 medals.
[15:44.260 --> 15:45.220]  So that's gotta go.
[15:45.320 --> 15:47.480]  Tell that to the U.S. soccer team yesterday.
[15:49.000 --> 15:50.920]  And they're used to swimming in shit rivers.
[15:51.040 --> 15:51.480]  So let's go.
[15:51.580 --> 15:51.800]  Come on.
[15:52.560 --> 15:55.180]  Yeah, all of our rivers are shit rivers in America.
[15:57.480 --> 16:00.960]  Gavin, coming to you here for the first pick on Italy.
[16:00.960 --> 16:03.160]  Over, under, 10 and a half.
[16:03.300 --> 16:03.640]  You feel it?
[16:03.680 --> 16:06.160]  The other half of my bloodlines.
[16:06.440 --> 16:07.620]  Yeah, what are your bones saying?
[16:07.740 --> 16:08.780]  What's the blood saying?
[16:09.900 --> 16:12.920]  If I'm checking the nourishment, I'm going to say slightly undernourished.
[16:13.820 --> 16:14.260]  Really?
[16:14.620 --> 16:15.560]  That's an under from me.
[16:16.320 --> 16:17.620]  Under 10 and a half?
[16:17.740 --> 16:18.120]  Wow.
[16:18.200 --> 16:19.420]  Who could have seen this coming?
[16:20.140 --> 16:21.160]  Gavin has been under on every single one.
[16:21.220 --> 16:22.080]  This is crazy.
[16:23.760 --> 16:27.060]  I recently watched the Pixar animated film Luca.
[16:27.220 --> 16:28.540]  I enjoyed that quite a bit.
[16:28.560 --> 16:29.060]  Great movie.
[16:29.060 --> 16:34.100]  I enjoyed the Equalizer 3, which also in an Italian small town.
[16:34.340 --> 16:36.180]  I've been really into Italy recently.
[16:36.360 --> 16:38.320]  I'm liking these small communities in Italy.
[16:38.660 --> 16:39.880]  I think they're going to go over.
[16:40.340 --> 16:42.900]  I'm feeling really the vibes on Italy right now.
[16:43.020 --> 16:43.680]  Real good.
[16:43.980 --> 16:44.720]  Real good vibes.
[16:44.820 --> 16:47.800]  What sport specifically do you think they're going to gold at?
[16:49.200 --> 16:51.440]  Swimming, because I just watched a fish movie.
[16:52.140 --> 16:52.300]  Swimming!
[16:52.720 --> 16:53.200]  Wait, no, no.
[16:53.800 --> 16:55.140]  Is triathlon in the Olympics?
[16:55.580 --> 16:56.320]  That's a big point.
[16:56.460 --> 16:56.800]  And Luca.
[16:57.260 --> 16:57.620]  Oh, yeah.
[16:57.620 --> 17:02.560]  I feel like the Italians will be a major disadvantage in the water because of all the hair.
[17:05.880 --> 17:07.600]  Now they're going to get waxed beforehand.
[17:07.800 --> 17:08.280]  They're doing okay.
[17:08.440 --> 17:09.700]  Okay, full body.
[17:10.080 --> 17:12.080]  Nick, over under ten and a half.
[17:14.600 --> 17:18.540]  I just watched The Last Crusade and they go to Venice in that movie.
[17:19.040 --> 17:20.220]  Let's go over.
[17:21.820 --> 17:22.480]  I don't.
[17:22.760 --> 17:23.660]  Yeah, makes sense.
[17:23.740 --> 17:24.360]  Gotta go with your gut.
[17:24.580 --> 17:25.440]  I see how you got there.
[17:25.520 --> 17:25.700]  Yeah.
[17:25.800 --> 17:27.260]  They smashed up that floor.
[17:27.260 --> 17:27.980]  They sure did.
[17:28.720 --> 17:29.340]  Spoilers.
[17:30.240 --> 17:37.100]  I think this is the summer games.
[17:39.360 --> 17:41.620]  Feel like Italy is going to go over.
[17:42.380 --> 17:45.460]  But if it's over, it's just to 11.
[17:45.820 --> 17:47.440]  You know what?
[17:47.500 --> 17:47.840]  I'm changing.
[17:48.020 --> 17:48.200]  It's under.
[17:48.540 --> 17:48.920]  Wow.
[17:49.400 --> 17:50.400]  Oh, you're doing a flip?
[17:50.740 --> 17:51.840]  You're doing a flippy flip?
[17:52.280 --> 17:55.180]  Yeah, I just don't have the...
[17:55.180 --> 17:58.220]  I just don't believe in Italy.
[17:58.980 --> 17:59.780]  Shut up.
[18:01.060 --> 18:04.240]  Like, they're going to walk away with eight gold medals and then they'll be happy with it.
[18:04.700 --> 18:06.620]  How did they do in the wars?
[18:06.860 --> 18:08.040]  The two wars that occurred?
[18:08.280 --> 18:10.180]  They didn't do great in World War II.
[18:10.380 --> 18:13.420]  Yeah, they really messed up.
[18:13.440 --> 18:14.200]  I'm trying to remember.
[18:14.400 --> 18:16.220]  I don't think I played as them in Call of Duty.
[18:17.800 --> 18:18.540]  Played against them.
[18:19.100 --> 18:20.500]  Geoff, what do you think?
[18:20.600 --> 18:21.340]  Italy, ten and a half.
[18:23.040 --> 18:25.080]  Well, following Nick's line of thinking,
[18:25.080 --> 18:28.080]  I haven't seen Last Crusade recently,
[18:28.220 --> 18:31.000]  but I did visit Venice in person last year.
[18:31.100 --> 18:36.040]  And I got to say, it was more crowded than I would have liked and stinky.
[18:36.660 --> 18:38.420]  And so for that, I'm going to take the under.
[18:38.660 --> 18:38.920]  Wow.
[18:39.140 --> 18:39.300]  Wow.
[18:40.240 --> 18:42.100]  You take your hands off the chess piece, Geoff.
[18:42.180 --> 18:43.300]  I just want a quick question.
[18:43.780 --> 18:45.540]  How would Tony Soprano feel about this?
[18:45.540 --> 18:48.020]  Because I know he's been a big part of your life recently.
[18:48.100 --> 18:48.980]  He has been a huge...
[18:48.980 --> 18:54.320]  We just watched the episode with that thing we sent around yesterday, actually.
[18:54.320 --> 18:55.280]  Oh, that's really funny.
[18:55.360 --> 18:57.960]  It was so funny that it just popped up.
[18:58.640 --> 19:02.220]  Tony Soprano would not like the state of Venice in 2024, I promise you.
[19:02.280 --> 19:03.920]  He would want to do something about it.
[19:05.340 --> 19:08.940]  I mean, he went to Italy and was walking along the beach
[19:08.940 --> 19:10.500]  that was just covered in, like, trash.
[19:10.700 --> 19:13.600]  And the whole time he was in Italy, I don't think he loved it, so...
[19:14.380 --> 19:16.800]  And they weren't super happy with him either, honestly.
[19:16.980 --> 19:17.680]  No, no.
[19:18.940 --> 19:20.720]  He tried to get him a good deal on cars.
[19:20.860 --> 19:22.460]  But Australia is next.
[19:22.940 --> 19:24.020]  Fourteen and a half.
[19:24.320 --> 19:26.400]  Oi, what do you think, Andrew?
[19:26.800 --> 19:32.380]  One half of the biggest summer blockbuster anyone's ever goddamn seen.
[19:32.900 --> 19:36.720]  Wolverine, Hugh Jackman, and a movie called Australia.
[19:37.060 --> 19:38.340]  Big money for Deadpool.
[19:38.700 --> 19:40.360]  Big gold for Australia.
[19:40.500 --> 19:41.200]  We're tolling over.
[19:41.560 --> 19:42.360]  It's going over.
[19:43.680 --> 19:43.880]  Okay.
[19:44.020 --> 19:47.000]  People are going to be all fucking pumped up about that Deadpool-Wolverine.
[19:47.080 --> 19:49.380]  They've been waiting to see Wolverine in that yellow suit.
[19:49.800 --> 19:52.480]  I think it's really going to inspire the athletes to put their best foot forward.
[19:52.480 --> 19:53.640]  Okay, okay.
[19:54.880 --> 19:56.060]  Nick, what do you think?
[19:56.540 --> 19:58.040]  Ah, it's long flight.
[19:58.360 --> 20:00.460]  Australia, the movie, way too long.
[20:00.780 --> 20:01.360]  So...
[20:01.360 --> 20:01.920]  Way too long.
[20:02.040 --> 20:02.820]  Way too long.
[20:03.000 --> 20:03.860]  Way too long.
[20:04.000 --> 20:04.820]  So therefore...
[20:04.820 --> 20:05.060]  I'm out of bars.
[20:05.200 --> 20:06.000]  I'm going under.
[20:06.500 --> 20:06.960]  I'm going under.
[20:07.080 --> 20:07.480]  Under?
[20:07.820 --> 20:08.000]  Yeah.
[20:08.500 --> 20:09.380]  Overstayed their welcome.
[20:10.740 --> 20:16.800]  I have been getting an exceptional amount of Australian athlete TikToks.
[20:17.180 --> 20:22.560]  I feel as though they are not focused on bringing home the gold
[20:22.560 --> 20:27.360]  and would not be surprised if they silvered out in most of these events.
[20:27.500 --> 20:29.160]  And for that reason, I'll be taking the under.
[20:29.440 --> 20:30.540]  This shit's insane.
[20:31.780 --> 20:35.280]  I would say this is the second easiest money of the day.
[20:36.100 --> 20:39.600]  I've spent a lot of time in Australia with the Australian people.
[20:39.620 --> 20:40.180]  They're proud.
[20:40.280 --> 20:40.820]  They're talented.
[20:41.340 --> 20:43.340]  I think they overperform consistently.
[20:43.800 --> 20:45.560]  I spent a day in Perth.
[20:45.880 --> 20:47.480]  I would never bet against those people.
[20:47.620 --> 20:50.180]  If all the Australian Olympic athletes were from Perth,
[20:50.360 --> 20:52.240]  I would say that they'd win 40 gold medals.
[20:52.240 --> 20:54.060]  They're easily going to overperform.
[20:54.300 --> 20:54.720]  I take the over.
[20:55.620 --> 20:56.060]  Over.
[20:56.280 --> 20:57.940]  And Gavin, what do you think of Australia?
[20:58.260 --> 20:59.060]  How do you think they're going to do?
[20:59.140 --> 21:00.100]  I think it's obvious.
[21:00.320 --> 21:00.980]  It's down under.
[21:01.140 --> 21:02.160]  I'm taking the under.
[21:02.520 --> 21:02.820]  Oh!
[21:02.960 --> 21:03.060]  Okay.
[21:03.200 --> 21:03.740]  All right.
[21:03.820 --> 21:04.140]  Oh!
[21:04.320 --> 21:04.660]  Okay.
[21:05.160 --> 21:05.840]  I like it.
[21:05.840 --> 21:07.560]  He's living in the land of unders.
[21:08.680 --> 21:10.900]  So that's a nice split there.
[21:11.000 --> 21:12.660]  But next, Nick.
[21:13.260 --> 21:14.560]  Canada, six and a half.
[21:14.980 --> 21:15.420]  Oh.
[21:16.420 --> 21:17.300]  Ah, you know what?
[21:17.760 --> 21:19.740]  This is for American basketball.
[21:19.740 --> 21:20.280]  Oh, I'm under.
[21:20.960 --> 21:21.340]  Under?
[21:21.340 --> 21:22.040]  You're under.
[21:22.040 --> 21:23.420]  I don't even have to think about it.
[21:23.500 --> 21:23.840]  Under.
[21:24.120 --> 21:24.840]  Go ahead, Geoff.
[21:25.160 --> 21:25.300]  No.
[21:25.300 --> 21:26.100]  Don't get me wrong.
[21:26.220 --> 21:29.500]  I love Canada, but they are in every way a silver medal country.
[21:29.660 --> 21:31.180]  They're going to underperform.
[21:31.280 --> 21:31.820]  I'm taking the under.
[21:32.400 --> 21:32.780]  Under.
[21:33.040 --> 21:33.960]  And Gavin, what do you think?
[21:33.960 --> 21:34.880]  Canada, six and a half.
[21:35.520 --> 21:35.920]  Ooh.
[21:36.060 --> 21:36.820]  What's the top?
[21:36.900 --> 21:37.560]  The North Pole.
[21:37.820 --> 21:38.820]  That's the top of the world.
[21:38.940 --> 21:40.060]  Just under that.
[21:40.600 --> 21:41.480]  I would say it's Canada.
[21:41.920 --> 21:42.440]  I'm going under.
[21:43.100 --> 21:44.320]  Under it is.
[21:44.720 --> 21:46.660]  And what do you think, Andrew?
[21:47.620 --> 21:48.420]  The disrespect.
[21:49.160 --> 21:51.760]  You're not factoring in the NBA gold.
[21:51.760 --> 21:53.060]  First of all, you got to put that.
[21:53.780 --> 21:56.640]  Second of all, NHL athletes are back.
[21:56.760 --> 21:57.580]  They're back in this.
[21:57.940 --> 21:58.540]  Sidney Crosby.
[21:58.920 --> 21:59.540]  He's going to be there.
[21:59.620 --> 22:00.160]  Conor McDavid.
[22:00.340 --> 22:00.920]  He's going to be there.
[22:01.020 --> 22:02.360]  They do it a lot of summer hockey.
[22:04.460 --> 22:08.140]  OK, well, they might like they might they might go to the Olympics.
[22:08.240 --> 22:09.100]  It's the offseason.
[22:10.080 --> 22:10.800]  This rocks.
[22:11.400 --> 22:12.780]  The offseason in hockey.
[22:12.860 --> 22:13.640]  So when they're doing...
[22:13.640 --> 22:14.160]  They might attend.
[22:14.820 --> 22:15.020]  Right.
[22:15.120 --> 22:15.780]  Which is a boost.
[22:15.840 --> 22:16.560]  It's a morale boost.
[22:16.880 --> 22:17.900]  The Canadian...
[22:17.900 --> 22:20.200]  You get Sidney Crosby, Conor McDavid hanging out.
[22:20.200 --> 22:21.880]  Canada's pretty excited about it.
[22:22.120 --> 22:23.180]  They like it a lot.
[22:23.640 --> 22:24.860]  Like black asses.
[22:25.700 --> 22:28.400]  I'm going to go Canada over.
[22:29.300 --> 22:29.840]  Shocker.
[22:30.000 --> 22:30.720]  You could have predicted.
[22:31.280 --> 22:31.540]  OK.
[22:32.000 --> 22:32.620]  They should put...
[22:32.620 --> 22:33.700]  Terry Fox, baby.
[22:34.400 --> 22:34.580]  Yeah.
[22:34.580 --> 22:35.100]  He's coming home.
[22:35.800 --> 22:37.340]  It's coming home.
[22:37.700 --> 22:38.540]  It's coming home.
[22:38.980 --> 22:39.580]  Seven of them.
[22:40.100 --> 22:42.920]  Why are there ridges on Reese's peanut butter cups?
[22:43.080 --> 22:45.000]  Probably so they never slip from her hands.
[22:45.360 --> 22:46.780]  Could you imagine I'd lose it?
[22:47.320 --> 22:49.120]  Luckily, Reese's thought about that.
[22:49.120 --> 22:50.920]  I wonder what else they think about.
[22:51.320 --> 22:53.680]  Probably chocolate and peanut butter.
[22:56.100 --> 23:00.080]  Hit pause on whatever you're listening to and hit play on your next adventure.
[23:00.700 --> 23:03.240]  Stay two nights and get a $50 Best Western gift card.
[23:03.840 --> 23:04.380]  Life's a trip.
[23:04.780 --> 23:06.120]  Make the most of it at Best Western.
[23:06.820 --> 23:09.220]  Visit bestwestern.com for complete terms and conditions.
[23:10.180 --> 23:11.440]  I'm next pick.
[23:11.920 --> 23:14.160]  Netherlands, 15 and a half.
[23:16.220 --> 23:18.020]  That's a lot for the Netherlands.
[23:18.020 --> 23:19.180]  It is.
[23:20.000 --> 23:20.840]  That's a lot.
[23:21.480 --> 23:23.360]  Like an exceptional amount.
[23:24.020 --> 23:25.620]  But I'm just gonna...
[23:25.620 --> 23:26.100]  I'm gonna...
[23:26.100 --> 23:27.220]  I'm just gonna go out on a limb.
[23:27.380 --> 23:28.000]  I'm gonna say over.
[23:28.300 --> 23:29.280]  I'm gonna try it.
[23:29.480 --> 23:32.240]  I'm gonna try over on this one and see where it takes me.
[23:32.460 --> 23:32.700]  Jeff?
[23:33.060 --> 23:34.400]  Not a good year for the Netherlands.
[23:34.600 --> 23:34.980]  They're gonna...
[23:34.980 --> 23:35.460]  I'm taking the under.
[23:36.240 --> 23:37.040]  Oh, OK.
[23:37.520 --> 23:37.940]  Cool.
[23:38.440 --> 23:39.740]  Gavin, what do you think?
[23:40.580 --> 23:41.460]  Uh, nether.
[23:41.740 --> 23:43.020]  I think, you know, it means like lower.
[23:43.560 --> 23:44.560]  So I'm gonna go under.
[23:45.120 --> 23:45.760]  Oh, OK.
[23:46.060 --> 23:46.580]  That's cool.
[23:46.860 --> 23:47.300]  That's good.
[23:47.300 --> 23:50.080]  And, um, Andrew, 15 and a half.
[23:50.080 --> 23:52.540]  I've never met a person from the Netherlands I've liked.
[23:53.220 --> 23:54.980]  Bad nation, my opinion.
[23:55.800 --> 23:56.460]  No, I'm just kidding.
[23:56.600 --> 23:59.060]  I don't have any opinions about the Netherlands.
[23:59.380 --> 24:04.260]  Although they do feel like, you know, the meme of like, we got Taco Bell at home or whatever.
[24:04.460 --> 24:04.600]  Yeah.
[24:04.840 --> 24:08.040]  I feel Netherlands is that to like New Zealand to me.
[24:08.100 --> 24:12.060]  Like they're the dollar store New Zealand, probably because they both start with any.
[24:12.240 --> 24:15.140]  And I know nothing about really Netherlands at all.
[24:15.960 --> 24:16.840]  15.5.
[24:17.060 --> 24:18.160]  I just don't like that number.
[24:18.240 --> 24:18.580]  I'm going.
[24:18.840 --> 24:19.700]  I'm going under.
[24:19.840 --> 24:21.080]  I'm going under on the Netherlands.
[24:21.200 --> 24:22.220]  I think they have a bad time.
[24:23.000 --> 24:23.440]  Under.
[24:23.620 --> 24:23.880]  OK.
[24:24.020 --> 24:25.100]  And Nick, what do you think?
[24:25.660 --> 24:27.080]  I love the country's name.
[24:27.200 --> 24:27.800]  It's so cool.
[24:28.360 --> 24:28.660]  Over.
[24:29.160 --> 24:31.920]  You like the name of the Netherlands?
[24:32.120 --> 24:32.800]  It's a great.
[24:32.840 --> 24:33.180]  It's a great.
[24:33.340 --> 24:34.500]  It's some spiral.
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.380]  Yeah, I like it.
[24:36.720 --> 24:36.880]  Yeah.
[24:37.280 --> 24:43.500]  Gavin and I once watched a guy from the Netherlands drink an entire glass boot full of beer and
[24:43.500 --> 24:46.620]  then scream at us to tell all of America about him.
[24:47.320 --> 24:48.200]  And now we have.
[24:49.380 --> 24:51.120]  My hand is off the piece.
[24:51.400 --> 24:52.020]  Fuck it.
[24:52.140 --> 24:53.980]  You couldn't have told that before, Jeff.
[24:54.100 --> 24:54.940]  Yeah, there we go.
[24:54.980 --> 24:56.420]  That's and that's why me and Nick went over.
[24:56.680 --> 24:57.240]  Oh, man.
[24:57.760 --> 24:58.920]  Inherently knew that story.
[24:59.340 --> 24:59.940]  Yeah, absolutely.
[25:00.220 --> 25:01.760]  But do you know anyone from Belgium?
[25:01.900 --> 25:04.060]  Because they're looking at three and a half here, Jeff.
[25:04.080 --> 25:04.500]  What do you think?
[25:04.540 --> 25:04.940]  Over under.
[25:05.400 --> 25:06.420]  This is a good year for Belgium.
[25:06.520 --> 25:07.060]  I'm taking the over.
[25:07.520 --> 25:08.320]  Over it is.
[25:08.360 --> 25:09.720]  And Gavin, what do you think?
[25:09.740 --> 25:10.600]  Over under three and a half.
[25:10.600 --> 25:11.200]  Oh, wow.
[25:11.260 --> 25:13.240]  The chocolate is great, but it's the sports.
[25:13.580 --> 25:14.700]  That's an under from me.
[25:15.320 --> 25:15.800]  Great.
[25:16.780 --> 25:18.500]  Andrew, over under three and a half.
[25:18.940 --> 25:19.440]  Here's the thing.
[25:19.500 --> 25:20.960]  As Gavin said, chocolate is great.
[25:21.060 --> 25:21.960]  I'm feeling the good vibes.
[25:22.400 --> 25:24.160]  Is the villain from Goldmember?
[25:24.320 --> 25:26.400]  Is he from Belgium?
[25:26.940 --> 25:27.440]  He's Dutch.
[25:27.600 --> 25:29.000]  Was Goldmember from Belgium?
[25:29.020 --> 25:29.620]  Was Dutch?
[25:29.780 --> 25:30.520]  Is that okay?
[25:30.860 --> 25:31.320]  Yeah.
[25:31.420 --> 25:32.440]  Freaky deaky Dutch.
[25:32.900 --> 25:33.240]  Okay.
[25:33.260 --> 25:34.040]  We're going over.
[25:34.480 --> 25:35.440]  Over all the way over.
[25:35.840 --> 25:37.180]  Oh, I'm liking the vibes.
[25:37.640 --> 25:39.400]  I'm 100% chocolate.
[25:39.560 --> 25:40.400]  100% metals.
[25:40.600 --> 25:42.280]  They're getting a lot of them.
[25:42.460 --> 25:42.940]  Okay.
[25:43.060 --> 25:44.280]  And, uh, Nick?
[25:44.680 --> 25:45.320]  Buy waffles!
[25:45.500 --> 25:45.760]  Over.
[25:46.660 --> 25:47.140]  Over.
[25:47.600 --> 25:50.720]  And this will be the first time that me and Andrew agree on one.
[25:50.780 --> 25:51.500]  I'm going over.
[25:52.040 --> 25:52.320]  Yeah!
[25:52.980 --> 25:56.320]  We've been opposite the whole way, but I can't deny.
[25:57.000 --> 25:57.720]  I didn't notice that.
[25:57.760 --> 26:00.760]  I was going to make it a bit and take it all the way to the end.
[26:01.140 --> 26:05.020]  But my want to win is too great.
[26:05.160 --> 26:06.700]  So I cannot do that.
[26:07.680 --> 26:10.160]  So I'll be taking the over as well.
[26:10.160 --> 26:14.140]  And next is Ireland at two and a half.
[26:14.260 --> 26:16.520]  Andrew, how are the vibes about Ireland?
[26:16.920 --> 26:19.780]  Honestly, vibes have maybe never been lower.
[26:19.960 --> 26:21.260]  And that's saying a lot.
[26:21.720 --> 26:22.780]  Vibes are real bad.
[26:23.240 --> 26:26.680]  I have a feeling that the vibes in Ireland probably were lower.
[26:27.380 --> 26:28.300]  A hundred years.
[26:28.360 --> 26:29.220]  Name one time.
[26:29.640 --> 26:30.300]  Name one time.
[26:33.360 --> 26:33.960]  1916.
[26:35.480 --> 26:37.380]  You're just throwing big numbers at me.
[26:37.440 --> 26:38.380]  That doesn't mean anything.
[26:38.380 --> 26:39.360]  Ireland.
[26:40.360 --> 26:41.140]  They're not.
[26:41.460 --> 26:42.900]  You two, not in the sphere anymore.
[26:43.100 --> 26:43.820]  That's old news.
[26:43.960 --> 26:45.800]  Nobody even remembers that they were there.
[26:46.260 --> 26:48.260]  Conor McGregor has never looked worse.
[26:48.400 --> 26:49.080]  He's terrible.
[26:49.600 --> 26:51.520]  His legacy is down.
[26:52.020 --> 26:52.900]  Irish people.
[26:53.180 --> 26:56.520]  I think it's been a tough time and it's going to continue to be tough.
[26:56.580 --> 26:57.900]  We're going under on Ireland.
[26:58.160 --> 26:58.440]  Under.
[26:58.780 --> 26:59.500]  Bad vibes.
[27:00.280 --> 27:01.060]  Yeah, I get it.
[27:01.460 --> 27:03.000]  Nick over under two and a half.
[27:04.760 --> 27:08.100]  I want a real Jamison kick.
[27:08.980 --> 27:09.900]  I'm going to go.
[27:09.900 --> 27:11.280]  But remember the potato famine?
[27:11.880 --> 27:13.320]  Okay, right.
[27:13.540 --> 27:17.320]  But the vibes were better during the potato famine than they are right now.
[27:17.340 --> 27:18.540]  Yeah, according to Andrew.
[27:18.780 --> 27:21.560]  You see that photo of McGregor and his broken toe?
[27:21.840 --> 27:24.880]  You have moved my chess piece into checkmate.
[27:25.100 --> 27:25.700]  I'm going over.
[27:26.620 --> 27:27.100]  Over.
[27:27.960 --> 27:30.240]  Uh, I'm actually with Andrew on this one.
[27:30.260 --> 27:31.000]  Under it is.
[27:31.080 --> 27:31.860]  I think the, um...
[27:32.480 --> 27:33.700]  I'm glad you and I are in it.
[27:34.800 --> 27:38.040]  My reason is mostly I just don't think the Irish are going to perform
[27:38.040 --> 27:41.120]  well in the summer games is just my thinking.
[27:42.040 --> 27:46.880]  You guys, Eric and Andrew are right, but not for the right reason.
[27:46.980 --> 27:51.960]  I actually have a little bit of inside intel into why Ireland is going to underperform
[27:51.960 --> 27:52.840]  in this Olympics.
[27:52.960 --> 27:54.460]  You can go ahead and put me down as the under.
[27:54.840 --> 28:01.460]  My in-laws, Emily's parents, just spent like 10 days touring the entire country of Ireland.
[28:01.800 --> 28:07.400]  And they had such a good time and had so many stories about how nice and friendly
[28:08.040 --> 28:11.800]  the Irish people were and how they would just sit and talk to you for hours if you wanted to,
[28:12.100 --> 28:14.740]  that I have a feeling the entire country's probably exhausted.
[28:15.420 --> 28:17.400]  Yeah, it sounds like they're overcompensating.
[28:17.520 --> 28:18.460]  They're a little worn out.
[28:18.560 --> 28:18.680]  Wow.
[28:18.680 --> 28:24.560]  They rolled out the red carpet to such a degree to my in-laws that they probably don't have
[28:24.560 --> 28:27.280]  the stamina in it to win three gold medals.
[28:27.420 --> 28:27.740]  Yeah.
[28:27.740 --> 28:28.300]  I'm taking the under.
[28:28.800 --> 28:29.140]  Okay.
[28:29.520 --> 28:32.260]  And Gavin, how do you feel about the Irish?
[28:32.760 --> 28:36.720]  I don't trust a country that can be entirely toured in about 10 days.
[28:36.840 --> 28:37.880]  So I'm going to go under on that one.
[28:37.880 --> 28:40.120]  Oh, Jesus.
[28:40.960 --> 28:42.140]  I've always said that as well.
[28:42.660 --> 28:45.540]  That's the most diplomatic way you put that, but that's good.
[28:45.640 --> 28:45.980]  Good work.
[28:47.340 --> 28:48.480]  Nick, you're first.
[28:48.580 --> 28:48.940]  Germany.
[28:49.160 --> 28:50.100]  Over, under, 10 and a half.
[28:52.620 --> 28:54.600]  How do I feel about this?
[28:55.280 --> 28:56.160]  You want me to go back to France?
[28:56.260 --> 28:56.720]  You know what?
[28:57.240 --> 28:58.060]  I'm going to go with the under.
[28:58.860 --> 28:59.300]  Under.
[28:59.620 --> 29:00.540]  Under 10 and a half.
[29:01.520 --> 29:01.800]  Okay.
[29:03.520 --> 29:03.960]  Germany.
[29:04.540 --> 29:04.980]  Strict.
[29:05.720 --> 29:06.160]  Deliberate.
[29:06.720 --> 29:07.160]  Intentional.
[29:07.160 --> 29:10.620]  I think Germany is going to overperform and probably greatly.
[29:10.760 --> 29:12.400]  I think they're going to take home like 14 gold.
[29:12.540 --> 29:13.540]  I think they're going to go crazy.
[29:13.940 --> 29:17.520]  And so I'm going to take Germany as the over on 10 and a half.
[29:17.760 --> 29:19.100]  I agree with Eric.
[29:19.620 --> 29:23.900]  When I think of Germany, the first word that comes to mind is formidable.
[29:24.360 --> 29:27.100]  I would never bet against them unless they were going up against us.
[29:27.520 --> 29:28.720]  So yeah, I'm taking the over.
[29:29.100 --> 29:30.040]  Over it is.
[29:30.900 --> 29:32.040]  Gavin, how do you feel about Germany?
[29:32.920 --> 29:33.800]  That's a tough one.
[29:38.470 --> 29:41.250]  I think they're going to just get 10, so under.
[29:41.330 --> 29:41.910]  Oh, wow.
[29:42.070 --> 29:42.470]  Wow.
[29:42.510 --> 29:43.330]  Under it is.
[29:43.690 --> 29:43.930]  Oh, shit.
[29:44.130 --> 29:44.310]  Okay.
[29:44.490 --> 29:44.630]  Okay.
[29:46.310 --> 29:50.610]  When I think of Germany, I think of high level engineering.
[29:50.730 --> 29:51.750]  I think of good design.
[29:51.990 --> 29:53.230]  I think of the Swiss army knife.
[29:53.650 --> 29:54.530]  I think of...
[29:54.530 --> 29:55.010]  That's Switzerland.
[29:55.110 --> 29:57.730]  Now, now, now let's go ahead and break that down.
[29:57.850 --> 29:59.530]  Why do you think of the Swiss army knife?
[29:59.890 --> 30:01.010]  I, you know what?
[30:01.170 --> 30:02.570]  I know it's a Swiss invention.
[30:02.830 --> 30:03.750]  It's in the name.
[30:03.750 --> 30:07.690]  But it's just really well constructed and it feels Germany.
[30:07.690 --> 30:08.490]  Does it not?
[30:08.970 --> 30:09.510]  Does it not?
[30:10.690 --> 30:11.210]  Really?
[30:12.610 --> 30:14.650]  I don't think it's Swiss at all.
[30:15.050 --> 30:16.870]  It's mostly red and white.
[30:18.710 --> 30:19.490]  You know what?
[30:19.510 --> 30:22.130]  I never factored in the color relation with the flag.
[30:22.250 --> 30:23.070]  That's a good point.
[30:23.570 --> 30:24.730]  Frickin flag on him.
[30:25.810 --> 30:26.210]  Not all.
[30:26.530 --> 30:27.330]  Well, that's a brand.
[30:27.590 --> 30:30.190]  Can you get Swiss army knives without the flag on it?
[30:30.410 --> 30:32.350]  I just assumed that was the leading brand.
[30:33.750 --> 30:38.070]  This is maybe the craziest thing we've ever recorded.
[30:38.170 --> 30:39.110]  Let me look at it.
[30:39.130 --> 30:40.190]  Since we've done monsters.
[30:40.770 --> 30:41.910]  Like this is insane.
[30:42.390 --> 30:43.450]  You start off with the truth.
[30:43.830 --> 30:45.690]  Like the Germans known for engineering.
[30:45.910 --> 30:47.210]  You could mention, you know, Mercedes.
[30:48.230 --> 30:50.070]  The Swiss army knife.
[30:52.290 --> 30:53.830]  That's the Swiss flag?
[30:56.010 --> 30:57.130]  Swiss flag.
[30:58.650 --> 30:59.930]  Oh my God.
[31:00.350 --> 31:02.110]  I thought that was a brand logo.
[31:02.430 --> 31:03.090]  I had no idea.
[31:04.050 --> 31:04.990]  That's crazy.
[31:05.390 --> 31:06.370]  That's insane.
[31:06.550 --> 31:07.090]  Okay.
[31:07.210 --> 31:09.550]  Well, what did the Germans make then?
[31:10.050 --> 31:12.230]  Why did they upgrade their engineering?
[31:13.910 --> 31:15.290]  Did they do toilets?
[31:15.810 --> 31:16.850]  Like doorknobs?
[31:17.010 --> 31:17.550]  Watches?
[31:17.630 --> 31:18.410]  Did they do watches?
[31:20.150 --> 31:21.610]  Who makes Rolex?
[31:24.010 --> 31:26.770]  I think watches are also claimed by the Swiss, typically.
[31:27.290 --> 31:30.710]  Have I given the Swiss not nearly enough credit?
[31:31.010 --> 31:31.610]  I think so.
[31:31.670 --> 31:32.950]  Well, you have plenty of time later.
[31:32.950 --> 31:35.270]  Because they're only one half.
[31:35.530 --> 31:36.910]  So, but that's later.
[31:36.910 --> 31:39.390]  Either way, I feel like Germany is very good at things.
[31:40.090 --> 31:47.580]  Oh, it's crazy.
[31:48.900 --> 31:49.240]  Yeah.
[31:49.340 --> 31:51.800]  I've seen that flag so many times that I didn't even know it.
[31:53.780 --> 31:53.900]  Yeah.
[31:53.920 --> 31:54.760]  You thought it was German.
[31:55.720 --> 31:58.620]  Well, I just, I thought it was a solid brand.
[31:59.140 --> 32:01.840]  This might be the most you you've ever been, Andrew.
[32:02.120 --> 32:03.000]  Oh my God.
[32:03.420 --> 32:06.320]  When people ask me what it's like to work with Andrew,
[32:06.320 --> 32:09.420]  I'm going to make them listen to just your parts of this.
[32:09.480 --> 32:10.120]  Oh, God.
[32:12.740 --> 32:14.340]  So what do you think, Andrew?
[32:14.720 --> 32:15.420]  Over, under?
[32:15.560 --> 32:16.140]  Ten and a half?
[32:17.200 --> 32:17.800]  Oh, God.
[32:18.040 --> 32:18.980]  Wait, am I going first?
[32:19.220 --> 32:19.940]  Oh, I said over.
[32:20.080 --> 32:20.420]  I said over.
[32:20.600 --> 32:21.060]  He said over.
[32:21.580 --> 32:22.240]  Okay, got it.
[32:22.300 --> 32:22.780]  Okay, cool.
[32:24.140 --> 32:29.020]  Next is, this is another country with a red and white flag, Japan.
[32:30.120 --> 32:32.940]  Nineteen and a half is their line for gold medals.
[32:33.840 --> 32:37.220]  Japan is a winter Olympics country to me.
[32:37.440 --> 32:39.320]  And for that reason, I have to put them at under.
[32:39.480 --> 32:41.860]  I don't think that they will crack 15.
[32:42.880 --> 32:43.800]  I'm going to go over.
[32:43.900 --> 32:45.760]  I think they're going to do well in some of the newer sports.
[32:47.180 --> 32:47.580]  Interesting.
[32:47.840 --> 32:49.200]  What new sports are we talking?
[32:49.580 --> 32:51.220]  There's like skateboarding, breakdancing.
[32:51.480 --> 32:54.040]  There's a lot of different, yeah, a lot of different newer type sports.
[32:54.180 --> 32:55.760]  A lot of like subjective things.
[32:56.080 --> 32:58.860]  Yeah, I think Japan's a young country in general.
[32:58.900 --> 33:02.500]  So I think that they're probably more attuned to the newer sports.
[33:02.940 --> 33:05.840]  Well, Japan right now has never been older, right?
[33:05.960 --> 33:07.940]  Yeah, it's a, it's a declining population.
[33:08.460 --> 33:10.040]  I understand that, but it's a mindset.
[33:10.320 --> 33:10.700]  That's what I'm talking about.
[33:10.700 --> 33:11.040]  Oh, okay.
[33:11.480 --> 33:11.740]  Okay.
[33:11.960 --> 33:13.380]  They embrace the future.
[33:13.680 --> 33:19.500]  I think even if you're young at heart and or of mind, I think a declining population,
[33:20.140 --> 33:23.600]  an aging population is a declining gold medal count.
[33:23.940 --> 33:24.300]  So under.
[33:25.760 --> 33:26.260]  Interesting.
[33:27.920 --> 33:30.040]  Andrew, I'm excited to hear about this.
[33:30.180 --> 33:31.400]  What are the vibes like with Japan?
[33:32.960 --> 33:33.700]  Can I?
[33:35.860 --> 33:38.440]  Do you have to look up which one Japan is?
[33:38.560 --> 33:40.520]  Here's the, no, here's the thing.
[33:41.440 --> 33:46.100]  I opened up my food app and I was going to make a determination based on if a certain
[33:46.100 --> 33:48.240]  restaurant was expected to be open today.
[33:48.240 --> 33:48.880]  Jesus Christ.
[33:49.220 --> 33:52.180]  And I'm just scrolling through and it's not there.
[33:52.680 --> 33:57.040]  But there is a place called Kamikaze Sushi, which I think is just a not a great.
[33:57.040 --> 33:58.300]  This cannot be released.
[33:58.640 --> 34:00.380]  We can't release this.
[34:00.700 --> 34:02.140]  It's what they're named.
[34:02.140 --> 34:03.560]  I didn't name them.
[34:04.280 --> 34:06.900]  It's a wild name for a sushi place.
[34:08.800 --> 34:10.180]  I'm going to say over.
[34:10.360 --> 34:10.980]  We're going over.
[34:15.740 --> 34:17.720]  One uncertainty for lunch.
[34:18.980 --> 34:20.920]  I'm looking at this Kamikaze Sushi place.
[34:21.360 --> 34:22.960]  Chicken Karate Bowl.
[34:23.380 --> 34:25.680]  What the fuck is going on?
[34:25.760 --> 34:27.240]  This is crazy.
[34:27.460 --> 34:30.940]  But it's time for Nick to say Japan over under.
[34:31.060 --> 34:31.680]  What do you think, bud?
[34:32.400 --> 34:36.660]  For all those reasons and more, I'm going with the under.
[34:36.880 --> 34:39.260]  I wouldn't I wouldn't want to associate with those reasons.
[34:39.360 --> 34:40.340]  I meant Gavin's.
[34:40.400 --> 34:40.940]  I was talking about.
[34:41.120 --> 34:41.360]  Oh, OK.
[34:41.600 --> 34:44.860]  Yeah, I'm just ignoring what happened before this.
[34:49.460 --> 34:54.640]  OK, New Zealand, three and a half.
[34:54.720 --> 34:55.860]  Jeff, what's your thinking here?
[34:56.800 --> 34:59.040]  Uh, it's an off year for them for some reason.
[34:59.120 --> 35:00.180]  They're going to them going under.
[35:00.180 --> 35:01.680]  I don't really know why.
[35:01.880 --> 35:02.540]  Just just instinct.
[35:02.760 --> 35:03.960]  Just yeah, I'm going my gut.
[35:04.560 --> 35:04.740]  Yep.
[35:05.000 --> 35:06.940]  And Gavin, what do you think about New Zealand?
[35:09.140 --> 35:09.540]  Um.
[35:12.220 --> 35:13.780]  It's pretty under there, isn't it?
[35:13.780 --> 35:14.600]  It is.
[35:14.880 --> 35:16.580]  It's not even on some of the maps, unfortunately.
[35:17.160 --> 35:18.900]  It's going to be an under for me, I think.
[35:18.980 --> 35:23.940]  OK, Andrew, three three and a half is the line here.
[35:24.140 --> 35:24.720]  What do you think?
[35:25.500 --> 35:26.220]  How many rugby?
[35:26.220 --> 35:30.280]  OK, well, it was we got male and female rugby.
[35:30.560 --> 35:31.580]  So that's two.
[35:32.960 --> 35:33.680]  Then there's sailing.
[35:34.840 --> 35:36.420]  Sailing is probably three.
[35:37.680 --> 35:38.700]  What's the fourth?
[35:38.820 --> 35:39.760]  What would be the fourth thing?
[35:40.240 --> 35:41.040]  What else are they doing?
[35:42.960 --> 35:43.660]  And they sneak out.
[35:44.740 --> 35:47.120]  I think they're going to end up with three exactly.
[35:47.240 --> 35:48.220]  So I'm going to take the under.
[35:49.260 --> 35:50.340]  Under it is for me, Andrew.
[35:50.780 --> 35:54.700]  Uh, Nick over under there.
[35:56.620 --> 35:58.760]  Three good Lord of the Rings movies.
[35:59.680 --> 36:02.200]  And three bad Hobbit movies.
[36:02.600 --> 36:05.020]  No, there's not three bad Hobbit movies.
[36:05.280 --> 36:06.640]  There are three bad Hobbit movies.
[36:07.480 --> 36:08.860]  Therefore, they don't hit the four.
[36:09.260 --> 36:09.800]  It is under.
[36:10.260 --> 36:12.320]  OK, I'm going to be the outlier here.
[36:12.420 --> 36:13.200]  I'm going to say over.
[36:13.320 --> 36:15.200]  I think they're going to shock the world in something like
[36:16.080 --> 36:17.840]  weightlifting or something like that.
[36:17.840 --> 36:19.140]  Just like out of nowhere.
[36:19.580 --> 36:20.400]  I like that.
[36:20.760 --> 36:21.260]  Like what?
[36:21.320 --> 36:22.960]  Like what Andrew said, I think is right.
[36:22.980 --> 36:24.200]  Where it's like, oh, they're going to get three.
[36:24.200 --> 36:26.800]  And then I think there's going to be one shocker, one out of nowhere.
[36:26.800 --> 36:28.120]  And it's going to be like, oh, fuck.
[36:28.180 --> 36:29.280]  New Zealand like overperformed.
[36:29.400 --> 36:30.140]  They hit the four.
[36:30.640 --> 36:32.760]  So I feel feel good about that over.
[36:34.600 --> 36:38.240]  But the next one is Gavin in Brazil.
[36:38.380 --> 36:41.520]  That would have been the first time we all agreed on one, by the way.
[36:41.580 --> 36:41.920]  Oh, yeah.
[36:42.380 --> 36:42.780]  Wow.
[36:43.500 --> 36:45.080]  Yeah, I don't.
[36:45.080 --> 36:46.360]  I'm not with you guys on that one.
[36:46.500 --> 36:47.920]  You're four wrong people.
[36:47.920 --> 36:51.040]  I just think it's interesting that we've never all agreed on one country.
[36:51.160 --> 36:51.840]  That is interesting.
[36:52.320 --> 36:53.020]  That is interesting.
[36:54.080 --> 36:55.560]  Gavin, seven and a half.
[36:55.700 --> 36:56.080]  Brazil.
[36:56.680 --> 36:59.640]  As you may know, we recently had the summer of 98.
[36:59.920 --> 37:05.500]  When I think of the summer of 98, I think of the World Cup final with Brazil versus France.
[37:06.000 --> 37:09.780]  Zidane threw in a headbutt and France beat Brazil.
[37:09.980 --> 37:12.320]  So I think Brazil history repeats itself.
[37:12.460 --> 37:14.240]  Summer of 98, under.
[37:15.000 --> 37:15.380]  Wow.
[37:15.900 --> 37:18.600]  Under it is interesting pick.
[37:18.760 --> 37:20.220]  But now it's on to Andrew.
[37:20.360 --> 37:20.880]  Seven and a half.
[37:21.180 --> 37:21.980]  Brazil vibes.
[37:22.040 --> 37:22.520]  What do you think?
[37:23.020 --> 37:27.060]  I think of the film Brazil, the vibes are off in the film Brazil.
[37:27.280 --> 37:29.960]  Not a lot of good vibes in the movie Brazil.
[37:30.540 --> 37:31.360]  I'm going under.
[37:32.080 --> 37:32.620]  Although...
[37:33.220 --> 37:34.180]  Nah, no.
[37:34.340 --> 37:34.960]  No, I'm going under.
[37:35.120 --> 37:35.560]  I'll just...
[37:35.560 --> 37:37.500]  Okay, under it is.
[37:37.700 --> 37:39.180]  Nick, what do you think?
[37:39.520 --> 37:40.420]  You know what?
[37:41.140 --> 37:44.940]  Gavin and Jeff had what could be equated to a Brazilian wax.
[37:45.700 --> 37:47.080]  And that was true.
[37:47.560 --> 37:50.560]  Hey, that was top tier content.
[37:51.520 --> 37:53.220]  I'm going to say over.
[37:53.900 --> 37:54.920]  Over, okay.
[37:55.440 --> 37:56.480]  Mm-hmm, interesting.
[37:57.820 --> 38:03.100]  I, even though it is a summer Olympics and everything, I just don't believe in Brazil
[38:03.100 --> 38:05.560]  getting eight gold medals.
[38:05.720 --> 38:07.920]  That sounds unreasonable to me.
[38:08.160 --> 38:09.820]  So for that, I will go under.
[38:10.440 --> 38:11.660]  Jeff, what do you think?
[38:11.900 --> 38:13.800]  I think Brazil is going to have a rough Olympics.
[38:13.900 --> 38:14.480]  I'm going to go under.
[38:15.100 --> 38:15.420]  Under.
[38:15.600 --> 38:18.120]  Well, we all would have agreed there if it wasn't for Nick, right guys?
[38:18.540 --> 38:19.860]  Yeah, four wrong people.
[38:19.860 --> 38:22.400]  Yeah, see, it feels good to be on that other side, right?
[38:22.540 --> 38:23.920]  It really does, until we're wrong.
[38:26.180 --> 38:31.320]  Andrew, Korea, eight and a half golds.
[38:31.460 --> 38:33.600]  What is the Korean vibe right now?
[38:34.700 --> 38:37.440]  Kamikaze, they got yam fries on the menu.
[38:37.560 --> 38:38.120]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[38:38.120 --> 38:42.300]  Which is, I've never seen yam fries on a Japanese restaurant menu.
[38:42.720 --> 38:47.760]  Korea, I'm thinking about Korea right now.
[38:49.160 --> 38:51.540]  So there's two Koreas, at least.
[38:52.140 --> 38:53.560]  Yeah, which Korea is this?
[38:54.200 --> 38:57.300]  I think it has to be not the northern one.
[38:57.800 --> 38:58.680]  Yeah, it's South Korea.
[38:59.080 --> 39:00.080]  It has to be South Korea.
[39:00.080 --> 39:01.260]  Well, right, South Korea then.
[39:02.420 --> 39:04.140]  Well, let's blame them.
[39:05.060 --> 39:05.720]  Blame the Olympics.
[39:07.460 --> 39:08.840]  You're throwing some hate at me.
[39:09.040 --> 39:10.960]  I didn't decide how to submit.
[39:12.000 --> 39:12.720]  What happened?
[39:13.300 --> 39:16.720]  Are they different teams or do they just join?
[39:16.720 --> 39:20.140]  I don't think North Korea is involved in the Olympic Games.
[39:20.420 --> 39:22.960]  North Korea has participated in the Olympics before.
[39:23.080 --> 39:23.480]  They might.
[39:23.800 --> 39:24.560]  Yeah, they've been in the Olympics.
[39:25.180 --> 39:25.520]  Have they?
[39:25.660 --> 39:27.400]  If they team up, then I guess keep it Korea.
[39:27.700 --> 39:28.260]  I just assumed.
[39:28.380 --> 39:29.300]  They do not team up.
[39:29.300 --> 39:30.540]  I don't think they team up.
[39:31.120 --> 39:32.140]  They do not team up.
[39:32.180 --> 39:36.500]  Gavin, I don't think they've been known for not teaming up.
[39:37.180 --> 39:39.120]  I think that's sort of the whole problem.
[39:41.020 --> 39:41.900]  I'm going to go...
[39:42.500 --> 39:44.200]  I completely don't care.
[39:44.200 --> 39:44.720]  Over.
[39:45.920 --> 39:49.660]  Oh, yeah, unlike the rest of these, dude, we care so much about all these.
[39:49.740 --> 39:49.940]  I do.
[39:50.020 --> 39:50.760]  We get to Korea.
[39:51.160 --> 39:54.220]  I do. I don't care about Korea's medal count. I'm going over.
[39:55.040 --> 40:00.280]  Over. Okay. Nick, South Korea or Korea. Eight and a half.
[40:00.700 --> 40:02.140]  You know what? I'll go over as well.
[40:03.620 --> 40:05.540]  Yeah, North Korea is in the Olympics.
[40:06.060 --> 40:08.640]  They're just not included in this 8.5.
[40:09.180 --> 40:13.100]  Well, there are 206 countries. We're just not... we didn't list them all.
[40:13.720 --> 40:16.960]  Under for South Korea, going under eight and a half.
[40:17.460 --> 40:25.680]  When I was in the military, the worst duty station to get was a year in South Korea.
[40:27.440 --> 40:31.660]  People hated to have to go there because the Korean army,
[40:31.960 --> 40:34.940]  they would train with them, and they were the toughest people on earth.
[40:35.560 --> 40:35.860]  Oh, wow.
[40:36.400 --> 40:38.060]  Our soldiers just couldn't hang.
[40:38.580 --> 40:40.600]  They were called the ROK Army, Republic of Korea Army.
[40:40.600 --> 40:44.240]  And every dude I knew that went there just had the most,
[40:44.700 --> 40:48.260]  like, had superhero stories about how tough the Korean military was,
[40:48.400 --> 40:50.760]  and just how much they just revered them and looked up to them.
[40:50.880 --> 40:53.760]  And so I would never bet against the South Koreans. So I'm going to go over.
[40:55.600 --> 41:00.200]  Over. Okay. Okay. And Gavin, Korea.
[41:00.780 --> 41:05.620]  Oh, I mean, geographically, when put next to North Korea, it's just under it.
[41:06.220 --> 41:07.000]  So I'm going to go under.
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.940]  Under it is. Good, good pick. Nick, Hungary.
[41:12.920 --> 41:15.180]  Six and a half for Hungary. That's pretty close.
[41:16.400 --> 41:20.700]  I feel like they're going to go under.
[41:21.580 --> 41:22.140]  Under?
[41:22.280 --> 41:23.300]  Under six and a half.
[41:23.560 --> 41:25.300]  Yeah. Maybe six.
[41:25.480 --> 41:26.050]  I think...
[41:28.500 --> 41:31.600]  I think they're going to surprise people in stuff like,
[41:32.280 --> 41:34.500]  like traditional, like Greco-Roman wrestling,
[41:34.500 --> 41:37.060]  and a lot of, like, the strength-based stuff.
[41:37.260 --> 41:40.120]  So I'm going to go... if they had seven, it wouldn't shock me.
[41:40.400 --> 41:41.200]  I'll go over.
[41:41.760 --> 41:42.040]  Hungary.
[41:42.980 --> 41:45.940]  I love Hungary. I love the Hungarian people.
[41:46.360 --> 41:48.940]  Shout out to Linda. Gavin and I miss you.
[41:49.780 --> 41:51.300]  Budapest, one of the coolest cities on earth.
[41:51.420 --> 41:55.380]  However, these are, similarly to America, very politically fractious times
[41:55.380 --> 41:57.420]  in Hungary right now.
[41:57.700 --> 42:03.120]  And I think it takes a lot of focus away from the matter at hand and is distracting.
[42:03.220 --> 42:04.120]  And so I'm going to go under.
[42:05.020 --> 42:07.540]  It is Gavin. What do you think?
[42:08.100 --> 42:11.860]  I like Hungary a lot. They have a pretty cool statue of Columbo.
[42:12.360 --> 42:16.500]  I would say a lot of, you know, Columbo was like the underdog of the detective world.
[42:16.920 --> 42:17.400]  So I'm going to go under.
[42:18.780 --> 42:21.220]  Yeah, I would say he's the underdog of the detective world.
[42:21.300 --> 42:23.020]  Yeah, absolutely. I'd also say that.
[42:24.340 --> 42:25.220]  And Andrew.
[42:26.260 --> 42:29.240]  Ham fries on the menu. I'm still processing that.
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.020]  Hungary, 6.5.
[42:33.020 --> 42:34.000]  I think you are hungry.
[42:34.960 --> 42:38.220]  I'm opening up a box of fruit as we speak.
[42:38.280 --> 42:39.500]  I'm getting a little snack in.
[42:39.900 --> 42:40.780]  Gotta replenish.
[42:42.920 --> 42:44.740]  I'm going... I'm going under.
[42:45.540 --> 42:45.800]  Under.
[42:46.460 --> 42:47.680]  I'm not feeling the vibe.
[42:47.700 --> 42:51.580]  I'm looking at their name and I'm not feeling the vibes right now.
[42:52.520 --> 42:53.360]  How do you feel about the flag?
[42:54.140 --> 42:56.220]  I don't think I could tell you what it looks like.
[42:56.780 --> 42:57.220]  Really?
[42:57.440 --> 42:59.660]  Is it on any products that I may have bought?
[43:01.660 --> 43:02.740]  Is it on a knife?
[43:02.740 --> 43:06.520]  I don't know that there's a lot of stuff that's like made in Hungary.
[43:06.980 --> 43:08.360]  Do you buy a lot of goulash?
[43:12.720 --> 43:13.140]  Goulash?
[43:14.780 --> 43:15.900]  Call of Duty thing?
[43:17.440 --> 43:17.860]  What?
[43:18.020 --> 43:19.060]  Oh my god.
[43:19.120 --> 43:20.080]  You fight in the goulash?
[43:20.600 --> 43:21.240]  Oh, yeah.
[43:24.560 --> 43:25.280]  I don't know what you said.
[43:25.620 --> 43:26.920]  Couple of people swimming around.
[43:30.060 --> 43:31.740]  Are you swimming in the goulash?
[43:33.660 --> 43:35.800]  Oh, they're dropping it in the gazpacho.
[43:38.100 --> 43:39.800]  Next up is the Czech Republic.
[43:40.540 --> 43:41.460]  Not even the right name.
[43:41.620 --> 43:41.980]  Three and a half.
[43:42.340 --> 43:44.660]  Three and a half is the line on...
[43:47.640 --> 43:48.600]  I gotta go under.
[43:49.100 --> 43:50.380]  I have to go under three and a half.
[43:50.620 --> 43:56.180]  It's just not... not striking me as a strong ear, but I guess we'll see.
[43:56.300 --> 43:56.540]  Jeff?
[43:56.960 --> 43:58.140]  I'm going under as well.
[43:58.500 --> 43:59.400]  Just bad vibes.
[44:00.160 --> 44:01.360]  Bad, bad vibes.
[44:01.940 --> 44:03.260]  Bad vibes, okay.
[44:05.100 --> 44:07.420]  Yeah, they might need a vibe check.
[44:09.980 --> 44:13.240]  But where is this list from that it's still Czech Republic?
[44:13.740 --> 44:14.940]  Yeah, I was... you know...
[44:16.280 --> 44:17.820]  It is what it is. It's fine.
[44:18.080 --> 44:18.520]  It's the...
[44:19.540 --> 44:21.700]  Literally isn't, but I'll go under.
[44:23.420 --> 44:24.680]  There's not even a reason there.
[44:24.700 --> 44:25.960]  You didn't even get cute with it.
[44:28.880 --> 44:30.720]  Now is Czech Republic...
[44:30.720 --> 44:32.960]  Are they a fashion nation?
[44:33.780 --> 44:37.540]  When I see Czech Republic, I think fashion for some reason.
[44:38.180 --> 44:38.940]  Is there a reason for that?
[44:39.160 --> 44:41.500]  Is there any thinking as to why that might be?
[44:41.720 --> 44:43.620]  No, I don't. I'm asking the group.
[44:44.360 --> 44:44.820]  Banana Republic.
[44:45.040 --> 44:46.760]  So you think it might be the Banana Republic?
[44:47.440 --> 44:49.920]  Oh, maybe. Maybe that's where I'm getting that from.
[44:52.440 --> 44:54.160]  I've been given a lot of...
[44:54.160 --> 44:55.360]  No, I've been going back and forth.
[44:56.100 --> 44:59.900]  3.5. I can't name like a rugby for the Czech.
[45:00.820 --> 45:02.240]  Uh, I'm going to go under.
[45:02.960 --> 45:05.000]  Star Wars has not been doing good recently.
[45:05.720 --> 45:07.680]  Oh, OK. Cool. Great.
[45:08.760 --> 45:09.220]  Nick.
[45:09.940 --> 45:11.180]  They're Republic, aren't they?
[45:11.300 --> 45:13.060]  Isn't Star Wars all about Republics?
[45:14.000 --> 45:14.300]  Yes.
[45:14.580 --> 45:14.840]  Yeah.
[45:15.140 --> 45:15.360]  OK.
[45:15.980 --> 45:16.320]  Yeah.
[45:17.600 --> 45:20.520]  Yeah, those last... those last movies were bad.
[45:21.660 --> 45:22.180]  Under.
[45:22.860 --> 45:23.740]  Let's all...
[45:23.740 --> 45:24.720]  Wow, this is the first time.
[45:25.060 --> 45:25.660]  We're all on under.
[45:26.500 --> 45:26.900]  There it is.
[45:26.940 --> 45:29.040]  We only agree on Czechia.
[45:29.540 --> 45:30.200]  Yeah. Yep.
[45:30.880 --> 45:32.760]  Well, no, we all agree on the Czech Republic.
[45:33.300 --> 45:34.500]  Oh, oh, right. Sorry.
[45:34.780 --> 45:35.520]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45:35.840 --> 45:39.400]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[45:39.780 --> 45:42.640]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[45:42.800 --> 45:46.360]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[45:46.720 --> 45:48.220]  Available for a limited time.
[45:48.460 --> 45:50.480]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[45:51.560 --> 45:54.260]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm.
[45:54.640 --> 45:57.920]  Checking off the boxes on your to-do list is a great feeling.
[45:57.920 --> 46:00.140]  And when it comes to checking off coverage,
[46:00.380 --> 46:03.560]  a State Farm agent can help you choose an option that's right for you.
[46:03.760 --> 46:08.020]  Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone, or using the award-winning app,
[46:08.260 --> 46:11.740]  it's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[46:12.100 --> 46:14.000]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[46:16.880 --> 46:21.740]  But Gavin, I'm sorry, Jeff, it's time for you to lay out for Poland.
[46:21.940 --> 46:22.500]  What do you think?
[46:23.180 --> 46:23.920]  Two and a half.
[46:24.700 --> 46:29.240]  Not my favorite water, Poland Springs, but I will drink it over a Dasani,
[46:29.860 --> 46:34.300]  and I would say I enjoy it, and it quenches my thirst when I need it to,
[46:34.400 --> 46:35.860]  so I'm feeling pretty good. Gonna go over.
[46:36.700 --> 46:38.680]  Over! You think there's gonna be more than...
[46:39.460 --> 46:40.940]  I think there's gonna be three gold medals.
[46:40.940 --> 46:42.740]  I think they're gonna get three gold medals.
[46:43.020 --> 46:44.660]  Okay, and Gavin, what do you think?
[46:45.420 --> 46:48.400]  Well, in German, Po is like your ass.
[46:49.480 --> 46:50.740]  Or your bottom.
[46:51.340 --> 46:51.560]  Yeah.
[46:52.300 --> 46:54.900]  Which is when you're under for that one.
[46:55.160 --> 46:55.440]  Okay.
[46:59.040 --> 47:00.840]  And Andrew, Poland.
[47:01.040 --> 47:02.980]  Germans made a lot of cars, apparently.
[47:03.180 --> 47:06.080]  That's what I was thinking. Gears, I was thinking that before.
[47:06.280 --> 47:07.400]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:07.400 --> 47:08.580]  We're talking about Poland now.
[47:08.800 --> 47:12.860]  Yeah, Poland, it's a tough nation.
[47:13.100 --> 47:16.180]  That's the tough people in Poland, 2.5.
[47:16.800 --> 47:19.420]  I gotta assume they got at least one good boxing in them.
[47:19.660 --> 47:21.040]  I feel like they're a boxing country.
[47:22.120 --> 47:23.640]  I don't know that to be true.
[47:23.700 --> 47:26.760]  I'm speculating wildly based off of one MMA fighter.
[47:27.080 --> 47:30.540]  I mean, totally different from the facts-based guessing you've been doing the whole thing.
[47:34.040 --> 47:35.340]  I'm not going off vibes here.
[47:35.400 --> 47:37.720]  I'm just, I'm trying to, I'm feeling the Polish energy.
[47:38.280 --> 47:40.680]  I feel like sausages are a thing I like.
[47:40.880 --> 47:42.540]  Polish sausage, I think, is a thing.
[47:44.480 --> 47:45.760]  2.5 isn't a lot.
[47:46.260 --> 47:46.680]  I think they...
[47:47.980 --> 47:49.060]  Yeah, I think they can do it.
[47:49.100 --> 47:49.500]  I'm going over.
[47:49.660 --> 47:50.020]  I'm going over.
[47:52.740 --> 47:53.100]  Cool.
[47:53.360 --> 47:55.060]  He was just speculating on that one, guys.
[47:55.500 --> 47:55.860]  Nick?
[47:55.980 --> 47:59.420]  I really wasn't feeling it the same way I was feeling a lot of the other ones.
[48:01.100 --> 48:01.780]  2.5.
[48:02.840 --> 48:04.700]  That seems so low.
[48:05.060 --> 48:05.720]  I think they can do it.
[48:05.820 --> 48:06.480]  They can squeak it.
[48:06.560 --> 48:07.240]  Let's do it, over.
[48:07.820 --> 48:10.680]  Okay, and to me, it's too many overs.
[48:10.760 --> 48:11.340]  I gotta go under.
[48:11.660 --> 48:12.740]  It's just, it's not...
[48:13.640 --> 48:14.320]  I don't think so.
[48:15.640 --> 48:18.840]  But that takes us to Spain at 4.5.
[48:18.920 --> 48:20.980]  Gavin, how do you feel about Spain in the Spanish?
[48:21.560 --> 48:23.260]  Well, they've been smashing it this year.
[48:23.340 --> 48:24.440]  They won the Euros.
[48:24.600 --> 48:25.500]  They won Wimbledon.
[48:27.320 --> 48:29.460]  I think they're pretty knackered from all that.
[48:29.640 --> 48:30.280]  So I'm gonna go under.
[48:30.920 --> 48:31.240]  Under.
[48:31.500 --> 48:32.440]  Yeah, they're tired.
[48:33.000 --> 48:33.380]  Definitely.
[48:34.380 --> 48:38.680]  Could I say something about Spain that I feel is unfair?
[48:39.420 --> 48:41.100]  I think this is an unfair thing.
[48:41.580 --> 48:47.320]  When there's a movie, I feel like Spain betrays a lot in movies.
[48:47.940 --> 48:49.120]  Which I don't think is fair.
[48:49.120 --> 48:52.720]  I feel like that's an inaccurate portrayal of Spain.
[48:52.820 --> 48:55.040]  But I feel like it's always like a double cross.
[48:55.500 --> 48:56.480]  And Spain is involved.
[48:58.400 --> 48:58.980]  Like what movie?
[48:59.000 --> 48:59.980]  Maybe I'm thinking Zorro.
[49:02.100 --> 49:02.500]  Zorro?
[49:03.680 --> 49:05.480]  Was Spain a villain in Zorro?
[49:05.680 --> 49:06.980]  The Antonio Banderas Zorro?
[49:07.600 --> 49:08.900]  Was Spain a villain?
[49:09.840 --> 49:11.340]  I don't know that we can release this.
[49:11.480 --> 49:13.300]  I'm very excited that we're doing this for us.
[49:13.400 --> 49:15.460]  I just don't know if we can come out for the public.
[49:15.460 --> 49:17.060]  No, this isn't against Spain.
[49:17.100 --> 49:18.060]  I think Spain's great.
[49:18.060 --> 49:19.340]  Spain's fantastic.
[49:19.500 --> 49:20.500]  Yeah, it's the movie's fault.
[49:21.600 --> 49:22.420]  That's what I'm saying.
[49:22.520 --> 49:23.560]  I'm saying an unfair betrayal.
[49:24.640 --> 49:26.420]  Betrayal, betrayal, all of it.
[49:28.740 --> 49:31.540]  Is Zorro Spanish or Mexican?
[49:33.740 --> 49:35.620]  Well, he's betrayed one way or the other.
[49:36.540 --> 49:38.040]  He's not Anthony Hopkins.
[49:38.240 --> 49:38.920]  I know that much.
[49:39.240 --> 49:40.320]  That was old Zorro.
[49:41.260 --> 49:44.860]  I'm saying Antonio Banderas, who's now old Zorro as well, unfortunately.
[49:45.360 --> 49:46.340]  They need a new Zorro.
[49:46.620 --> 49:47.700]  Where's Zorro been?
[49:48.060 --> 49:49.220]  They're bringing back everybody.
[49:49.440 --> 49:51.660]  I think we have the right amount of Zorros.
[49:51.880 --> 49:52.560]  We're going over.
[49:52.720 --> 49:53.740]  We need a new Zorro.
[49:54.040 --> 49:55.400]  We're going to get Zorro in here.
[49:55.540 --> 49:56.760]  People are going to get real excited.
[49:57.880 --> 49:59.600]  Nick, Spain, four and a half.
[49:59.800 --> 50:01.520]  Everything's coming up Spain, Eric.
[50:01.740 --> 50:02.500]  We're going over.
[50:03.220 --> 50:05.480]  Yeah, I gotta agree with you.
[50:05.620 --> 50:07.660]  They're on the run of a lifetime right now.
[50:09.020 --> 50:09.980]  They're winners.
[50:10.380 --> 50:13.260]  They're kicking tourists out of their country with water guns.
[50:14.920 --> 50:16.240]  I don't really understand.
[50:16.240 --> 50:21.400]  I still don't really understand what's happening or why, but they are doing it.
[50:21.520 --> 50:23.340]  And for that, I will go with the over.
[50:23.640 --> 50:23.920]  Hell yeah.
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.600]  Yeah, Spain is a whole mood right now.
[50:27.660 --> 50:29.220]  They are on a winning streak.
[50:29.300 --> 50:30.220]  It's going to continue.
[50:30.360 --> 50:35.100]  The Sagrada Familia is going to be finished, I think, next year or in 2026.
[50:35.100 --> 50:37.060]  That's been going for like 120 years.
[50:37.400 --> 50:42.800]  I'm not looking for this Spain train to stop anytime soon.
[50:42.860 --> 50:43.380]  I take the over.
[50:44.140 --> 50:44.840]  Over it is.
[50:45.580 --> 50:47.680]  That'll take us to...
[50:51.300 --> 50:52.760]  Switzerland at .5.
[50:52.840 --> 50:53.820]  Over, under, Andrew.
[50:54.180 --> 50:55.600]  What do you think about the Swiss Army knife?
[50:56.200 --> 50:57.840]  I mean, what have they ever accomplished?
[50:58.380 --> 50:58.860]  I'm going under.
[50:58.980 --> 51:00.340]  Well, there's that Swiss Army knife.
[51:00.960 --> 51:02.580]  Yeah, but that's German engineering for you.
[51:03.540 --> 51:05.660]  So you'll say they're not going to get a single goal.
[51:05.900 --> 51:06.900]  No, I don't feel it.
[51:06.940 --> 51:08.300]  I'm not feeling Switzerland this year.
[51:08.520 --> 51:12.340]  They're too busy making an additional knife onto whatever they're doing.
[51:13.280 --> 51:13.680]  No.
[51:13.680 --> 51:15.880]  You just said that was German engineering.
[51:16.080 --> 51:20.400]  Yeah, well, listen, their greatest invention is German engineering, so I don't know.
[51:22.100 --> 51:23.140]  Good God.
[51:25.920 --> 51:27.020]  So are you under?
[51:27.700 --> 51:28.640]  I said under.
[51:29.080 --> 51:29.660]  Yeah, it's under.
[51:29.780 --> 51:30.320]  He said under.
[51:32.000 --> 51:33.120]  Nick, over or under?
[51:33.400 --> 51:35.520]  They'll at least fall ass backwards into a gold.
[51:35.840 --> 51:36.340]  Over.
[51:37.760 --> 51:40.000]  Okay, I'm actually going under as well.
[51:41.160 --> 51:43.980]  Winter country, not feeling the Samba Olympics.
[51:44.340 --> 51:44.900]  Gold for them.
[51:45.200 --> 51:46.500]  Plenty of silvers, lots of bronze.
[51:46.760 --> 51:48.020]  Not having it for gold.
[51:48.400 --> 51:48.960]  Yeah, fuck them.
[51:49.020 --> 51:49.920]  Samba for me too.
[51:50.280 --> 51:51.940]  Yeah, yeah, fuck them.
[51:52.040 --> 51:52.860]  That's what I said.
[51:53.400 --> 51:53.720]  Yeah.
[51:53.980 --> 51:55.900]  Yeah, that's how I felt.
[51:56.240 --> 51:57.500]  As Eric said, yeah, fuck them.
[51:57.960 --> 51:58.320]  Great.
[51:58.540 --> 52:00.140]  And Gavin, how do you feel about the Swiss?
[52:00.660 --> 52:02.800]  Yeah, I'm just going to have to agree with the majority here.
[52:02.840 --> 52:03.780]  I think you guys are onto something.
[52:05.540 --> 52:07.160]  This is such a mess.
[52:07.860 --> 52:10.560]  Uh, next up, Nick, Cuba.
[52:11.140 --> 52:12.280]  Gavin's gonna win something.
[52:12.540 --> 52:13.380]  Yeah, right?
[52:13.680 --> 52:15.060]  I think it's an interesting test.
[52:17.840 --> 52:21.440]  I've never had a Cuban cigar and it makes me sad.
[52:22.020 --> 52:22.360]  Under.
[52:25.460 --> 52:28.540]  The reasonings make about as much sense as mine.
[52:29.000 --> 52:30.380]  Yeah, I mean, yeah, really.
[52:30.540 --> 52:32.340]  Uh, Cuba, summer games over.
[52:33.600 --> 52:34.900]  I feel good.
[52:35.020 --> 52:35.780]  Yeah, Cuba's got it.
[52:36.400 --> 52:37.060]  Three at least.
[52:37.160 --> 52:40.200]  I have had a Cuban cigar and it was pretty good,
[52:40.440 --> 52:44.200]  but I feel like I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as Nick if he'd have had the opportunity.
[52:44.360 --> 52:45.360]  And I feel bad about that.
[52:45.420 --> 52:46.180]  So I'm taking the under.
[52:46.320 --> 52:47.080]  Yeah, you know what?
[52:47.340 --> 52:47.780]  It is.
[52:48.140 --> 52:49.540]  Thanks for joining me here.
[52:50.360 --> 52:50.660]  Yeah, man.
[52:50.760 --> 52:50.920]  Cool.
[52:51.240 --> 52:52.680]  Don't worry, you'll have Gavin on your side.
[52:52.760 --> 52:53.420]  Gavin, what do you think?
[52:53.440 --> 52:54.200]  Over or under on Cuba?
[52:54.360 --> 52:54.900]  Two and a half.
[52:57.400 --> 52:58.820]  It's right there by Florida, man.
[52:59.440 --> 53:01.240]  I don't think they'll get a single one, you know?
[53:01.380 --> 53:01.940]  I think zero.
[53:02.140 --> 53:02.280]  Wow.
[53:02.600 --> 53:02.920]  Wow.
[53:03.880 --> 53:04.200]  Wow.
[53:04.520 --> 53:04.720]  Wow.
[53:04.860 --> 53:05.460]  Way under.
[53:05.720 --> 53:05.980]  Okay.
[53:06.320 --> 53:06.640]  Jeez.
[53:06.640 --> 53:08.500]  Uh, okay.
[53:08.600 --> 53:11.380]  Andrew, let me let me ask you, what's the vibe?
[53:11.800 --> 53:13.560]  What's the vibe with Cuba right now?
[53:14.240 --> 53:15.460]  They're not in crisis.
[53:15.760 --> 53:17.060]  It's what I'm aware of.
[53:18.760 --> 53:19.780]  Vibes are good.
[53:21.300 --> 53:23.460]  Don't just focus purely on the sport.
[53:24.020 --> 53:26.340]  We have to play a video game after this, dude.
[53:26.380 --> 53:27.740]  We don't want to start with this.
[53:27.740 --> 53:28.340]  We don't want to broadcast after this.
[53:30.300 --> 53:31.260]  I'm going over.
[53:31.620 --> 53:32.460]  I think things are good.
[53:33.260 --> 53:35.020]  I think things are going okay over there.
[53:35.020 --> 53:41.080]  Uh, uh, Kenya, four and a half gold starts with me.
[53:44.920 --> 53:45.960]  I'm gonna go over.
[53:47.760 --> 53:49.800]  Uh, I think this is Kenya's year, guys.
[53:50.340 --> 53:51.720]  I think we're gonna see six.
[53:51.820 --> 53:52.640]  I think we're gonna see six gold.
[53:52.640 --> 53:53.000]  Really?
[53:53.740 --> 53:55.380]  Yeah, I think it's gonna be a big year for Kenya.
[53:56.060 --> 53:56.140]  Yeah.
[53:56.380 --> 53:58.080]  That's an easy over for me as well.
[53:58.500 --> 53:59.520]  Okay, okay.
[53:59.740 --> 54:02.180]  But Gavin, is it an easy over for you?
[54:02.740 --> 54:04.340]  Ooh, it's got a lot of people.
[54:04.340 --> 54:05.520]  A lot of potential there.
[54:07.620 --> 54:11.340]  But, uh, I mean, I saw what the Covenant did to it in Halo 3.
[54:11.520 --> 54:11.940]  Oh, yeah.
[54:11.940 --> 54:12.940]  Halo 2, so.
[54:13.100 --> 54:13.580]  Oh, yeah.
[54:14.120 --> 54:14.940]  Yeah, yeah.
[54:15.300 --> 54:16.240]  Oh, fuck.
[54:16.540 --> 54:17.320]  Yeah, glass.
[54:17.860 --> 54:18.040]  Under.
[54:18.660 --> 54:19.020]  Under.
[54:19.220 --> 54:20.180]  Okay, okay.
[54:20.420 --> 54:22.480]  And, um, Andrew, Kenyan vibes.
[54:22.560 --> 54:23.000]  What are you thinking?
[54:23.420 --> 54:26.020]  Gavin, really, he's the one that pushed me in this direction.
[54:26.300 --> 54:27.640]  Kenyan know what's coming for it.
[54:27.660 --> 54:29.420]  They gotta get going while the going is good.
[54:29.480 --> 54:30.420]  They're gonna be celebrating.
[54:30.540 --> 54:31.720]  They're gonna be playing real hard.
[54:31.820 --> 54:32.360]  They're going over.
[54:32.700 --> 54:33.640]  They're overachieving.
[54:33.640 --> 54:34.940]  Because they know what's coming.
[54:35.300 --> 54:35.580]  Okay.
[54:36.180 --> 54:38.720]  And what's coming is what happened in Halo 2?
[54:38.760 --> 54:39.900]  Yeah, the Covenant invasion.
[54:40.040 --> 54:41.160]  They know it's gonna...
[54:41.160 --> 54:42.380]  Listen, it's not great for them.
[54:43.000 --> 54:44.400]  Right, and they know it's coming.
[54:44.520 --> 54:45.160]  That's the thing.
[54:45.660 --> 54:47.360]  I, you know, Halo sold very well.
[54:47.420 --> 54:48.140]  I bet you they do.
[54:53.320 --> 54:56.520]  Oh, my God.
[54:56.640 --> 54:59.380]  Thanks for picking 26 countries, by the way, and not 10.
[54:59.860 --> 55:00.360]  Appreciate it.
[55:00.720 --> 55:02.000]  It's 25, doofus.
[55:02.000 --> 55:03.460]  It's just, it's down one.
[55:04.240 --> 55:05.160]  Oh, sorry.
[55:05.820 --> 55:06.620]  No, you're right.
[55:07.180 --> 55:10.620]  That's a hard doofus.
[55:10.800 --> 55:13.060]  That might be the hardest doofus I've ever received.
[55:13.340 --> 55:17.080]  I got a doofus pie right to the face there.
[55:17.260 --> 55:18.100]  So emphatic.
[55:21.620 --> 55:22.740]  I'll take that over.
[55:23.300 --> 55:24.520]  I'll take that over.
[55:25.960 --> 55:29.800]  Oh, my fucking god, 25 doofus.
[55:34.240 --> 55:35.120]  Oh, Christ.
[55:35.840 --> 55:37.440]  From the German knife guy.
[55:39.560 --> 55:42.600]  I stabbed that German knife right in your back immediately.
[55:44.680 --> 55:46.720]  Romania, Jeff, seven and a half.
[55:46.900 --> 55:48.000]  We're almost there, guys.
[55:48.140 --> 55:53.660]  I feel like Romania is too close to Transylvania, which means that's more of a winter sport kind of
[55:53.660 --> 55:56.120]  stay away from the sunlight scenario.
[55:56.520 --> 55:58.980]  Too many Draculas, not enough gold medals.
[55:59.140 --> 55:59.780]  I'm gonna go under.
[56:00.260 --> 56:02.080]  Under it is Gavin.
[56:03.160 --> 56:05.580]  I mean, Romania, that doesn't even have Rome.
[56:05.800 --> 56:07.980]  If it doesn't have Rome, it's not.
[56:08.100 --> 56:09.480]  Oh, I don't know where I was going with that.
[56:13.880 --> 56:17.400]  Andrew, Andrew, we're going under.
[56:17.780 --> 56:19.280]  As Jeff said, yeah, too many Draculas.
[56:19.600 --> 56:22.260]  Okay, Nick, what do you think?
[56:22.380 --> 56:24.960]  Rome has fallen many times and it shall again, under.
[56:24.960 --> 56:25.380]  Under.
[56:27.100 --> 56:30.340]  Okay, Rome has fallen, but we're talking about Romania.
[56:30.560 --> 56:32.000]  Sure, it's got Rome in the name.
[56:32.660 --> 56:34.800]  That's a way better version of Gavin's aborted joke.
[56:36.520 --> 56:37.760]  I got you, Gavin.
[56:37.920 --> 56:39.640]  I'm gonna say under as well.
[56:39.740 --> 56:41.620]  We'll keep it all in the family at under.
[56:41.700 --> 56:43.280]  Wow, we got two countries left.
[56:43.300 --> 56:44.000]  I know.
[56:44.520 --> 56:45.380]  Two countries left.
[56:45.540 --> 56:46.600]  Gavin, you lead this one.
[56:46.880 --> 56:49.120]  Jamaica at 0.5.
[56:49.180 --> 56:51.680]  Will they get one gold medal at least?
[56:51.680 --> 56:56.500]  Oh, you know, I think we're up for a year of silvers for Jamaica, unfortunately.
[56:56.800 --> 56:57.420]  So I'm going to go under.
[56:58.360 --> 56:58.480]  Wow.
[56:59.840 --> 57:00.360]  Unbelievable.
[57:01.060 --> 57:01.780]  The disrespect.
[57:03.180 --> 57:08.820]  If you are not cheering for a country that is only expected to win half a medal,
[57:10.240 --> 57:10.860]  you're not living.
[57:11.060 --> 57:12.000]  You're not living life.
[57:12.540 --> 57:13.300]  This isn't over.
[57:13.660 --> 57:16.460]  I want to be cheering for it all Olympics long.
[57:16.800 --> 57:19.740]  I don't even know what this medal could be, but I want it.
[57:20.060 --> 57:20.920]  We're going over.
[57:21.620 --> 57:22.760]  Oh, okay.
[57:24.540 --> 57:25.400]  Over it is.
[57:25.760 --> 57:27.780]  Then Nick, what do you think?
[57:28.000 --> 57:34.360]  I was blasting the Muppets version of Kokomo on my speaker the other day.
[57:34.400 --> 57:35.420]  I don't...
[57:35.420 --> 57:36.020]  This is okay.
[57:36.220 --> 57:36.360]  What?
[57:37.700 --> 57:38.580]  Aruba, Jamaica.
[57:39.140 --> 57:39.420]  All right.
[57:39.520 --> 57:39.820]  Racist.
[57:39.820 --> 57:40.900]  No, no.
[57:41.720 --> 57:43.060]  I want to take you.
[57:43.280 --> 57:43.740]  So let's go.
[57:43.840 --> 57:44.260]  Yeah, over.
[57:45.040 --> 57:45.720]  I believe in over.
[57:46.800 --> 57:49.620]  I think 0.5 is such a low line for Jamaica.
[57:50.080 --> 57:51.660]  They've won gold in the past.
[57:51.680 --> 57:52.980]  It's not like it's new to them.
[57:53.120 --> 57:54.940]  I think that they will win at least one.
[57:55.020 --> 57:55.700]  I'm going to take the over.
[57:56.220 --> 57:57.360]  I think they got...
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.840]  I think it's a two or three gold medal year for them.
[58:00.940 --> 58:01.660]  I'm taking the over.
[58:02.020 --> 58:02.520]  Hell yeah.
[58:02.560 --> 58:02.820]  Okay.
[58:03.080 --> 58:05.140]  And I believe in them like John Candy did.
[58:05.940 --> 58:06.780]  Oh, nice.
[58:06.960 --> 58:08.380]  That's a cool runnings, bud.
[58:09.300 --> 58:13.220]  And finally, for some reason, last on this list, Kazakhstan.
[58:13.740 --> 58:15.740]  One and a half gold is the line.
[58:15.920 --> 58:17.160]  Andrew, what do you think?
[58:17.720 --> 58:18.720]  Is New Spain...
[58:19.660 --> 58:20.800]  Was that Mexico?
[58:20.800 --> 58:22.480]  Was Mexico once called New Spain?
[58:23.540 --> 58:24.020]  Yeah.
[58:24.100 --> 58:25.500]  Because you guys had me real panicking.
[58:25.680 --> 58:29.800]  I had to look up the nationality of Zorro, which is apparently a highly Googled thing.
[58:30.780 --> 58:34.600]  It says he's from California, New Spain, or Mexico.
[58:36.020 --> 58:36.260]  Okay.
[58:36.780 --> 58:36.920]  Okay.
[58:37.100 --> 58:38.380]  Is New Spain part of Mexico?
[58:42.080 --> 58:43.200]  Where is New Spain?
[58:45.100 --> 58:49.240]  Well, it's not in Kazakhstan, the country that you're trying to get gold on.
[58:49.260 --> 58:49.940]  One and a half.
[58:49.940 --> 58:52.000]  So close to the finish line.
[58:52.180 --> 58:54.900]  I feel like Jamaica running as fast as I can.
[58:56.000 --> 58:57.000]  Under it is.
[58:57.060 --> 58:57.400]  Nick?
[58:58.800 --> 58:59.340]  One and a half.
[58:59.360 --> 59:00.420]  I feel like they can do two.
[59:00.620 --> 59:01.140]  Let's go over.
[59:01.800 --> 59:02.200]  Over.
[59:02.440 --> 59:05.480]  I'm also taking the under on this.
[59:06.760 --> 59:07.960]  I just don't think it's happening.
[59:08.340 --> 59:08.820]  What do you think, Jeff?
[59:09.200 --> 59:10.000]  Can I ask a question?
[59:12.680 --> 59:13.040]  Who?
[59:13.640 --> 59:14.200]  I'll take it.
[59:14.240 --> 59:15.860]  Is your silence a yes or no?
[59:16.020 --> 59:17.960]  Oh, we just don't know who the who is.
[59:18.160 --> 59:18.680]  But sure.
[59:18.960 --> 59:19.780]  Yeah, you can ask me.
[59:20.580 --> 59:21.660]  Can to all of you.
[59:21.740 --> 59:24.600]  Does anyone know is MMA in the Olympics?
[59:25.580 --> 59:25.860]  No.
[59:26.280 --> 59:27.360]  No, it's just boxing.
[59:27.780 --> 59:29.060]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[59:29.440 --> 59:30.160]  All right, I'll take the under.
[59:31.080 --> 59:31.400]  Under.
[59:31.640 --> 59:31.960]  Okay.
[59:32.860 --> 59:35.240]  And Gavin, over under Kazakhstan.
[59:35.280 --> 59:35.940]  One and a half.
[59:36.780 --> 59:40.820]  I feel like honestly, I've been overthinking a lot of these choices and trying to rationalize
[59:40.820 --> 59:41.440]  them a little too much.
[59:41.540 --> 59:41.880]  I agree.
[59:42.000 --> 59:42.800]  Leave this one up to chance.
[59:42.860 --> 59:43.540]  I'm going to roll a dice.
[59:43.680 --> 59:45.060]  If it's odd, I'm just going to go under.
[59:45.100 --> 59:46.560]  If it's even, I'm going to go over.
[59:46.680 --> 59:47.000]  Here we go.
[59:47.220 --> 59:47.460]  Okay.
[59:48.820 --> 59:49.720]  I'll be under.
[59:50.240 --> 59:51.620]  Under it is.
[59:53.200 --> 59:54.220]  This has been.
[59:54.640 --> 59:55.480]  What experiment?
[59:55.720 --> 59:55.920]  Yeah.
[59:56.060 --> 59:59.040]  Guys, would you have this before we advance?
[59:59.300 --> 01:00:03.640]  Would you have taken the over on Kazakhstan because of Dagestani fighters, Jeff?
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.380]  Is that where the brain was going?
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.280]  It's not just Dagestani fighters.
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:11.260]  I feel like that whole area of the world is really good at fighting.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.600]  I feel like it's Dagestan with like Habib and all.
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:17.700]  I mean, Dagestan is definitely like the fucking center of it.
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:18.320]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:19.740]  Tough areas.
[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:20.340]  Tough fighters.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.560]  Tough areas.
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.300]  Tough fighters.
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:23.400]  Great drafts.
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:24.700]  Fucking yam fries.
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:25.520]  Can you believe that?
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:26.240]  That's insane.
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:30.600]  Thank you so much for listening to our Olympic coverage.
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:37.400]  I'm going to be excited to see we're providing coverage for the Olympics.
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.600]  I don't know what else to call this.
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:42.820]  We'll be watching alongside seeing who does what.
[01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:47.020]  Someone's getting a medal and that someone is me because I've been feeling the vibes
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:48.740]  and I feel real good about my whole list.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:51.220]  It sucks that Gavin's going to win this thing.
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:51.540]  Yeah.
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:53.560]  No, there's no way he wins.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:59.340]  Like, like we it's not like there was good thought put into this, but you know, there was
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:05.520]  thought it's the thing where like a squid picks the like March Madness and they get like further
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:06.320]  than everyone else.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:06.980]  You know what I mean?
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:11.960]  And it's just sort of Gavin just had a plan and we'll see.
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.540]  I played a squid game.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:20.380]  Do we do do we do a follow up video after the Olympics or something?
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:21.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:22.560]  Yeah, we'll have to.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.080]  Yeah, we'll talk about it.
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:24.260]  Yeah.
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:25.160]  Okay.
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:26.980]  Let us know.
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.760]  Watch like watch this.
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:29.800]  You have the lines.
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:34.780]  Make your own picks on your over under the community can put something together and you
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:37.780]  guys can see where you stack up against all of our picks.
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:42.260]  Is there someone out there picking over for every single one to counterbalance?
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.980]  Yeah, I did that last Olympics.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:45.420]  It went well.
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:45.940]  My God.
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:47.860]  It went pretty well last time I did that.
[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:49.540]  Keep track.
[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:50.460]  See how we do.
[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:53.000]  Let us know what you think of these picks.
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:54.740]  Go to Regulatrion.com.
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:55.780]  Sign up for the Patreon.
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.760]  Check out our regulation gameplay channel.
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:01.000]  See what else we have going on.
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:01.740]  Thank you.
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:04.420]  This has been regulation Olympic coverage.
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.580]  We've picked the over under on everything.
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:09.120]  And we'll see you next time.
[01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:10.120]  Bye.
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:12.060]  Sorry.
[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:19.320]  First practice is almost here.
[01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:24.340]  Gear up on budget when you shop quality used sports equipment and play it again sports.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:27.400]  Plus get paid on the spot for outgrown items.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:33.260]  It's the sustainable way to shop and sell for football, soccer, golf, hockey, and more.
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:34.700]  Play it again sports.
[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:36.400]  Your back to school go to.
