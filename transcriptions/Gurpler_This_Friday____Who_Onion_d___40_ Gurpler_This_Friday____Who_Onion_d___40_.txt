[00:30.000 --> 00:35.840]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is number 40.
[00:36.120 --> 00:41.320]  My name is Jeff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Frey, Eric Baddour,
[00:41.540 --> 00:47.020]  and Nick Schwartz. Hello, boys. Off the jump, let's just get it out of the way right now,
[00:47.460 --> 00:52.520]  because this episode's coming out, I think, two days before Gerpeltine's Day. We should just...
[00:52.520 --> 00:56.100]  Eric gets mad because we forget and let it slip to the last three minutes of the podcast.
[00:56.520 --> 01:03.460]  Don't forget, the Gerpler's coming out on Friday... I almost said April. Friday, February 14th at
[01:03.460 --> 01:08.360]  noon Central time, Gerpeltine's Day. We have 5,000 of them. There will also be some signs
[01:08.360 --> 01:12.840]  and a t-shirt reorder in there as well. I have one Mario Party at this point,
[01:12.920 --> 01:16.300]  and I feel very good about it. Everything is right in the world. I'll tell you what didn't
[01:16.300 --> 01:20.540]  happen. I didn't get disconnected. I may not have won, but I was connected the entire time.
[01:20.540 --> 01:25.880]  And we'll be locked down at this point. But checking in at the sign vote at this current
[01:25.880 --> 01:34.080]  moment, 709 for the scrumping, 459 for the Falcons. I am surprised. Hell yeah. I'm surprised
[01:34.080 --> 01:38.380]  it's so big. I honestly, I went with the scrumping because that's where my heart is,
[01:38.700 --> 01:44.100]  but I thought Falcons would be higher. We'll see. We'll see what happens.
[01:46.220 --> 01:49.540]  How was everybody's week since we last recorded a podcast?
[01:49.540 --> 01:57.120]  I got injured in my sleep. Oh, I thought it was a dream. Go on. Face episode six. Hell yeah.
[01:58.620 --> 02:03.960]  I was sleeping. And you know, like when you're in that state of not knowing if you're awake or
[02:03.960 --> 02:08.120]  if it's like if that's real, like if it really happened or maybe you dreamt it. I had one of
[02:08.120 --> 02:15.400]  those. And for some reason, I decided to bring my elbow as high up past my head as I could.
[02:15.400 --> 02:22.320]  And I did that. And I felt like a tinge in my kind of shoulder blade area. And I went,
[02:22.440 --> 02:28.640]  oh, fuck, I'm 30 now and I need to be careful of how I'm stretching in my sleep. God damn it.
[02:29.020 --> 02:34.080]  And then I went to sleep again. I fell back to sleep and thought nothing of it,
[02:34.220 --> 02:40.740]  continued on for the day, then went to go to sleep the following evening. And upon laying down,
[02:40.740 --> 02:48.420]  it felt like I was getting stabbed in the back and I had to adjust. I can't pull on things without
[02:48.420 --> 02:54.680]  pain. I don't know what I've done if I've like pulled a muscle or like strained a tendon in my
[02:54.680 --> 03:01.900]  shoulder. But I've been I've been on the injury report for the past three days. Hopped out of the
[03:01.900 --> 03:07.680]  tub yesterday, tried to dry off and went, oh, oh, when I'm doing the little shake motion with the
[03:07.680 --> 03:14.800]  towel, we're hurt. Anybody else get on the injury report from sleeping? Uh, no. I mean,
[03:14.840 --> 03:21.020]  Gavin's always on the injury report. How's the gas situation, Gavin? Oh, I wouldn't say it's
[03:21.020 --> 03:24.740]  an injury though. That's just something to wake up with and deal with and then it's fine.
[03:28.220 --> 03:34.860]  It's not an injury. It's just a way of life. It's just a misery. Like if your roof has a leak
[03:34.860 --> 03:37.980]  and you just have to dump the bucket once a day, is that an injury?
[03:38.760 --> 03:45.780]  No, that's certainly. Well, maybe to the house, actually. I think it's exactly what it is to the
[03:45.780 --> 03:50.160]  roof. Yeah. Yeah. It seems like something that should be repaired. I mean, it's a bad analogy,
[03:50.480 --> 03:56.980]  right? All time worst analogies. Yeah. Too bad you don't have a get out of Greg free card because
[03:56.980 --> 04:02.400]  you could have definitely used it there. Yeah, I am stuck inside, Greg. Did Andrew ever use his?
[04:02.400 --> 04:06.400]  Oh, yeah, Andrew, did you know? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I didn't. I'm glad I didn't.
[04:07.860 --> 04:12.840]  He's looking forward to using it soon, though. I there's been multiple opportunities. Is it
[04:12.840 --> 04:15.860]  because so much of the audience agreed with you and whatever you were going to use it for? No,
[04:15.900 --> 04:22.320]  it just wasn't as bad. The pitchforks were in a sharp as I thought. The only reason why I didn't
[04:22.320 --> 04:27.740]  use it is because I thought the funniest way to use it would be to have me interject right before
[04:27.740 --> 04:34.940]  the conversation happened in the episode. Just be like, oh, stop everyone. The conversation
[04:34.940 --> 04:40.280]  that's about to happen. But I had that thought too late and I didn't want to, like, make that
[04:40.280 --> 04:47.380]  suggestion to Nick. So I was like, fuck it. I'll just whatever comes comes. I'll write it out.
[04:47.640 --> 04:52.380]  Why would you have to inform Nick about the Greg? Yeah, because I wanted that edited into the
[04:52.380 --> 04:57.400]  episode at that point. I wanted we would have the argument and then just remove it from the cut.
[04:57.400 --> 05:01.720]  No, no, no, no, no. It wouldn't be removed. What would happen is I would like right before
[05:01.720 --> 05:07.340]  it would start, new audio of me coming in would interject, be like, I'm stopping the episode for
[05:07.340 --> 05:14.000]  a minute. I'm playing the Greg card. Everything that precedes this argument, I'm safe for.
[05:14.380 --> 05:17.700]  So you have to use you have to fire up the time machine to use your Greg card.
[05:18.020 --> 05:23.320]  Uh, I mean, that's not how our reality works. It's how the show reality would work. Yeah. So
[05:23.320 --> 05:29.640]  no. Well, sort of. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I see what you mean. Yeah. Yeah. You're right.
[05:30.780 --> 05:34.160]  Interesting. I didn't realize it would it would use the time machine because so far,
[05:34.220 --> 05:38.980]  I think only Nick and Eric have used the time machine and I've never used it. You've used it.
[05:39.300 --> 05:43.960]  I think the three of us have used it when we were promoting the first Gurgler.
[05:43.980 --> 05:48.040]  Yeah, I think that was the first time we used it. Yeah. I think so. The three of us. Yeah.
[05:48.380 --> 05:51.920]  We're just not known for using it. No, we're not. We're not known time.
[05:51.920 --> 05:57.620]  Eric and Nick are iconic time machine. Yeah, but I'm happy to open that door if you guys want to
[05:57.620 --> 06:02.040]  become time machine guys yourself as well. Just sort of like a whole show of people who can use
[06:02.040 --> 06:06.120]  the time machine. So it doesn't have to be me. I'm fine with that. I feel like when I think about
[06:06.120 --> 06:12.740]  time travel, I think about like a dinosaur with late, like a laser contraption on its eyes and
[06:12.740 --> 06:20.620]  a machine gun. And then Nick and Eric. Can I can I use the time machine now to go back to the
[06:20.620 --> 06:26.920]  beginning of this conversation? Please don't. OK. Oh, wow. OK. All right. I was going to say yes,
[06:26.940 --> 06:32.260]  but Nick said no. So I guess that's sort of. Let's see what happens. Look, look, if you want to hide
[06:32.260 --> 06:37.240]  the keys to the time machine, that's fine. Yeah. Nick drives it. I just I'm along for the ride.
[06:37.300 --> 06:40.900]  You know what I mean? Let's go fucking nuts. Nick, do you want to use the time machine to
[06:40.900 --> 06:47.360]  go back and be less negative towards Gavin's idea? Will you use it to have a better analogy
[06:47.360 --> 06:52.840]  than if there was a leak in your roof? Is that the plan? You just tell me where you want to go,
[06:52.940 --> 06:58.620]  Gavin. I want to go right before I made a really shit analogy about. Absolutely not. Absolutely
[06:58.620 --> 07:05.120]  not. No, it's too close. Yes, you got the time machine has to go further back in time. They can't
[07:05.120 --> 07:10.260]  go that soon back. Sorry, man. It's like a limitation. You don't have a great free card.
[07:10.580 --> 07:14.980]  That's true. What if I go back to the beginning of the time machine conversation and let everyone
[07:14.980 --> 07:19.780]  know that we're about to start talking about the time machine? Is that still too soon? I think you
[07:19.780 --> 07:25.760]  should use the time machine and be here on time. That would be a great time machine. Oh, high five
[07:25.760 --> 07:31.560]  there. Oh, oh, get him. Oh, wow. That was good. Was I was I not on time today? You were one minute
[07:31.560 --> 07:37.380]  late. You were one minute late. Oh, shit. I apologize. And now that we sink at the beginning,
[07:37.380 --> 07:41.460]  I feel like it really fucks up your whole showing up on time thing because you technically you need
[07:41.460 --> 07:48.180]  to be here for a sink. Also, Nick got weird today and sink without weird. He's like, should we do
[07:48.180 --> 07:52.860]  the sink without Gavin? It's like, I don't understand what that would accomplish. Nick,
[07:52.900 --> 07:59.740]  what do you think the sink is for? Nick, I took notes on this question from before. If you want,
[07:59.840 --> 08:04.940]  I'll give it to you. I got you. OK, OK, go ahead. But it's lining up audio. Clearly,
[08:05.580 --> 08:10.720]  put all the tracks down and they all go at the same time. Yeah, I can see at the beginning where
[08:10.720 --> 08:17.200]  everybody's countdown is. And if it's further in the track, it's harder to find. I, uh, I don't
[08:17.200 --> 08:26.280]  I don't mean to throw shade at you, Jeff, but. Oh, please do. Please do. Yeah. I had something
[08:26.280 --> 08:31.300]  happen to me in a in a game and GTA is playing by myself. And I thought, oh, this is going to be a
[08:31.300 --> 08:37.020]  funny story to tell. And I captured clips of it. And I was like, well, this is, you know, podcast
[08:37.020 --> 08:42.720]  to be easier if it was a photo. And I went to look. I took the most Jeff photo of this story
[08:42.720 --> 08:50.020]  that I could have possibly taken. I was so disappointed in myself where this is the one
[08:50.020 --> 08:57.720]  image I took during this process. It doesn't it doesn't explain anything that happened or
[08:58.440 --> 09:07.500]  what the issue was. It is so contextually just empty within the context of the story.
[09:07.680 --> 09:13.100]  It makes it but it's just like even within knowing what I'm doing with this,
[09:13.140 --> 09:18.380]  it's like, why did I take this angle? What was there was just zero thought process.
[09:18.820 --> 09:24.320]  I was clearly panicking. I, uh, I was playing GTA five by myself and I've been trying to do
[09:24.320 --> 09:29.100]  these research missions where you go out and you have to steal something and then bring it
[09:29.100 --> 09:34.980]  back to your bunker and you can like unlock new upgrades that way of like different gun attachments
[09:34.980 --> 09:44.020]  or a heavy machine gun on a car type thing. And so for this one, I had to steal a tank that was
[09:44.020 --> 09:51.920]  like six miles away, but they let you have a cargo bob next to the tank so you could scoop it up.
[09:51.920 --> 09:59.280]  You can attach a clip to it and then fly it all the way to your bunker, which I did. And it was
[09:59.280 --> 10:04.380]  great. It only took me like four minutes, except when I went to put it in the little yellow circle,
[10:04.380 --> 10:12.180]  I came in a little bit hot and the tank flipped upside down like two feet away from the circle
[10:12.180 --> 10:17.800]  and I couldn't get into the tank. And I had to try to figure out how am I going to move this tank
[10:17.800 --> 10:25.880]  two feet just so I could wrap this up by myself? And it became a mass struggle. I was trying to
[10:25.880 --> 10:31.680]  steal vehicles to ram into it. It wouldn't move it. I was like, how the fuck am I going to?
[10:32.240 --> 10:38.720]  It's two feet like it's just two feet and I got 20 minutes to do it. Come on. I called in,
[10:38.940 --> 10:45.040]  as you can see in the screenshot, my ramp vehicle. I thought I was very clever seven minutes into
[10:45.040 --> 10:49.420]  this 20 minute timer. I was like, I'm going to get the ramp vehicle and then I'm just going to
[10:50.000 --> 10:55.440]  scoop it up. It's going to launch over like everything else. It does not do shit. Didn't
[10:55.440 --> 11:02.100]  work at all. Just drove under it. Just bounced off of it like it didn't really. Yeah. Like it
[11:02.100 --> 11:07.540]  didn't scoop it in any capacity. I could not figure out how to get this thing to move. And what's
[11:07.540 --> 11:13.740]  annoying about the tank, and I guess this is just how tanks work, is the heavy part is the lid
[11:14.280 --> 11:20.800]  and the part that you shoot. Like if you shoot the body of it, it just spins because it rotates
[11:20.800 --> 11:27.600]  around the head like it's the part you can't. It's not solid. Like it just spins in a circle.
[11:27.860 --> 11:35.800]  If you make contact with the trucks when they're upside down, like a 360s, it doesn't. Yeah. Like
[11:35.800 --> 11:42.600]  so instead of the the blow of the impact going in a singular direction, all you do is you spin it
[11:42.600 --> 11:49.620]  either clockwise or counterclockwise, which makes it harder to push. I was I thought one
[11:49.620 --> 11:55.840]  of my solutions was, oh, maybe maybe Gavin can help because I eventually came to the idea of
[11:55.840 --> 12:01.120]  I'm an alien blaster. And I don't know if any of you guys have that, but I know Gavin does.
[12:01.520 --> 12:04.500]  Yeah. Call me in. Well, I was going to. You were streaming with Meg,
[12:04.560 --> 12:10.340]  so I didn't want to interrupt that. So I was like, I'm fucked. But I kept trying. Took me
[12:11.320 --> 12:17.560]  17 and a half minutes to move a tank two feet. I got there. I did it. I completed it.
[12:17.640 --> 12:23.720]  But it was just me constantly shooting this thing for like 17 minutes straight with an alien
[12:23.720 --> 12:27.880]  blaster. Is that how you did it was shooting? That's how I did it. And there is nothing else
[12:27.880 --> 12:32.980]  I could do to flip it. And I only flipped it not like I didn't even push it to the yellow.
[12:33.200 --> 12:39.100]  I was able to move it like a foot to the left and it just rolled over because kind of on a hill
[12:39.500 --> 12:44.480]  downward. Jeff, we've played a lot of the game. Should we both present our ideas for what we
[12:44.480 --> 12:48.960]  would have suggested? Yeah. Oh, you go ahead. I know what I would have used immediately,
[12:49.020 --> 12:53.880]  but you go ahead. OK, Andrew, I would have pulled up in the Batman rocket car and I would have just
[12:53.880 --> 12:59.580]  backed up to it and then just blasted my jet engine. I don't have it, but I like the idea.
[13:00.020 --> 13:03.920]  I do have that. I could have I could have done that for you. Gavin or Andrew would have been
[13:03.920 --> 13:09.520]  happy to. I would have pulled up in my phantom wedge, which is the 18 wheeler with the scoop
[13:09.520 --> 13:14.140]  front that will push through anything. And I would have just nudged it with that. It's got my nose on
[13:14.140 --> 13:20.000]  the front. I did look at that. I didn't have enough cash. I considered trying to buy my way out of
[13:20.000 --> 13:26.720]  this problem, but I didn't. I was like 400,000 short. That's rough. Yeah. I wish I could have
[13:26.720 --> 13:32.780]  loaned you the 400,000. I have a clip for this if you want to see that. Oh, yeah, sure.
[13:33.920 --> 13:41.720]  Just as an example of the frustration that I was going through. Let me put a link here.
[13:42.220 --> 13:51.100]  You'll see what I mean by where it spins. The trucks spin on this thing. It's very annoying.
[13:52.800 --> 13:58.380]  So this is just me. I'm trying to Andrew like it's right there and I'm trying to get it. I'm just
[13:58.380 --> 14:04.060]  trying to scooch it a little bit. This is so stupid. I'm just trying to scooch it. This is so...
[14:04.820 --> 14:10.420]  This is the dumbest... I'm like how... Why didn't you just redo the mission, man? I can't.
[14:11.840 --> 14:16.900]  I'm locked in and I'm like, it's two feet away. That little green bunker symbol next to the ammo,
[14:17.060 --> 14:21.160]  that's where I got to get it. So I eventually decide I'm just going to try to push it down the
[14:21.160 --> 14:25.860]  hill because it's closer. I mean, this is working. This might be... Yeah, I'm getting... I want you
[14:25.860 --> 14:29.940]  to get five minutes from when you took the screenshot originally. Just if you're listening
[14:29.940 --> 14:36.320]  to this, just know the tank is totally upside down and it is teetering on the top part of the tank
[14:36.320 --> 14:42.760]  that spins. And so he's just shooting it. It's kind of rocking back and forth, but literally
[14:43.800 --> 14:49.940]  inching to where... Like this isn't right. It's like watching a seven-year-old try to
[14:49.940 --> 14:54.200]  move her refrigerator. So it was daytime when I started this mission in the context of how long
[14:54.200 --> 15:01.840]  this has been. This is me fleeing. You're a maniac. So this is when you come in hot. Yeah, great.
[15:02.620 --> 15:07.560]  So I'm coming. They're chasing me. And you're going to see that it was a problem. This whole
[15:07.560 --> 15:14.600]  mission had problems to it. Yeah, everything's wrong with this mission. Oh my god! Andrew!
[15:14.600 --> 15:17.580]  I thought I was being very sneaky. Flying a little low there, dude. Andrew clipped the
[15:17.580 --> 15:21.740]  tank on a tree and a railing. He's just hitting all the trees. He's hitting shrubs. I'm trying
[15:21.740 --> 15:27.720]  to avoid the trees. Andrew! I'm getting chased by helicopters. But I may have come up with a new
[15:27.720 --> 15:34.860]  sport, I believe, if this lines up the way I think it does. Oh, like conkers? Oh no! So like, shot put with the tank.
[15:35.840 --> 15:45.660]  Dude! That was a trebuchet! How did you do that? That's the coolest thing I've ever seen! Oh my god! Gavin and I were in unison!
[15:45.660 --> 15:53.300]  It started with that, but that was... What? I've never seen that work! That is my tank journey
[15:53.300 --> 15:58.220]  GTA, but mainly when I wanted to show a screenshot of like, this is where the tank was to the hole,
[15:58.340 --> 16:03.400]  and I didn't have that. And I felt like such an idiot just looking at my one dumb side screenshot.
[16:03.700 --> 16:08.920]  I want people to know who are listening. What we just saw was Andrew in a cargo bob carrying
[16:08.920 --> 16:14.960]  a tank so low that he's hitting trees and shrubs. It gets hung up on a pole and it
[16:14.960 --> 16:21.820]  catches so that cargo bob keeps going forward, the tank drags behind, and then the momentum
[16:21.820 --> 16:27.500]  gets to the point where he does a full front flip and then launches the tank forward like
[16:27.500 --> 16:35.120]  Gavin said, like a trebuchet. That's insane! He did a full flip! That was in a cargo bob! What?
[16:35.620 --> 16:40.000]  Can I ask a question? We're not recording tomorrow morning, right? We decided not to?
[16:40.040 --> 16:44.560]  Yeah, we're doing a thing. You, Gavin and I are doing a thing, but we can also do this.
[16:44.560 --> 16:49.900]  Oh, right. After we do the thing, can we do this? Yeah. I would love to try this. This,
[16:49.980 --> 16:52.720]  and also I want to do my Call of Dirty idea that I pitched you guys yesterday.
[16:53.020 --> 16:59.300]  I did some research on it and it gets even better. Yeah. Oh, great. Yeah, we could try a tank toss,
[16:59.620 --> 17:02.180]  like light up on the same tree and see who can throw it the furthest.
[17:03.780 --> 17:07.180]  That's really interesting. Just something to think about. Who knows how long the thing that
[17:07.180 --> 17:10.860]  the three of us are doing will take. I also had an idea for a draft that we could maybe do at
[17:10.860 --> 17:17.500]  some point. And what's that? How do you feel about a a peeve draft? Yeah, I love it. What?
[17:17.740 --> 17:23.060]  What is that? Oh yeah, like drafting peeves. What's that? Things that annoy us. Pet peeve.
[17:23.700 --> 17:28.580]  Like, we were just talking about one of mine earlier today, actually. Is pet peeve one of
[17:28.580 --> 17:32.020]  the types of peeves or are they all pet peeves? I don't know what that means.
[17:32.900 --> 17:34.560]  You're asking the helium guy that question?
[17:37.540 --> 17:41.060]  I've just never used, never really used peeve on its own. It's always pet peeve. But why do you
[17:41.060 --> 17:47.360]  specify what kind of peeve? Peeve, verb, annoy or irritate. That was one thing that peeved him.
[17:47.660 --> 17:52.140]  But what's the pet part? My peeve is people treating me like a moron. That's you, Eric.
[17:52.300 --> 18:02.160]  When you go to the Wikipedia for it, it says pet peeve. A pet peeve, pet aversion or pet hate is a
[18:02.160 --> 18:07.840]  minor annoyance that an individual finds particularly irritating to a greater degree than the norm.
[18:08.180 --> 18:11.640]  What the fuck is a pet aversion? Just seems like you don't like cats.
[18:11.920 --> 18:16.120]  So it's like a pet to mean small? Is that what it means? I think so. I think so.
[18:17.020 --> 18:21.620]  Dude, should we create Wikipedia where we just list all the things that are peeves?
[18:21.780 --> 18:26.200]  That's so good. Pretty good. I think this is going to be Eric's honorable mentions. I think we're
[18:26.200 --> 18:29.960]  going to finish the draft. Do you have any honorable mentions? And Eric just be like,
[18:29.960 --> 18:33.360]  boys, boys, sit down, boys. I got my list.
[18:34.720 --> 18:36.780]  Yeah, Wikipedia could just be the name of our peeve draft.
[18:37.040 --> 18:39.240]  I like Wikipedia. I love it. That's great.
[18:39.500 --> 18:43.620]  Hey, Fidelity, how can I remember to invest every month?
[18:44.500 --> 18:50.520]  With the Fidelity app, you can choose a schedule and set up recurring investments in stocks and ETFs.
[18:51.320 --> 18:53.000]  Oh, that sounds easier than I thought.
[18:53.440 --> 18:54.280]  You got this.
[18:54.560 --> 18:57.820]  Yeah, I do. Now, where did I put my keys?
[18:58.520 --> 19:00.820]  You will find them where you left them.

[19:14.780 --> 19:19.580]  and refresh? An ice cold Diet Coke isn't just a break. It's your chance to catch your breath

[19:28.320 --> 19:33.320]  Should we take a second before we get too far into the episode to discuss the rooster teeth of it?
[19:34.400 --> 19:35.780]  Oh, it's probably a good idea.
[19:35.900 --> 19:35.980]  Sure.
[19:36.040 --> 19:36.200]  Yeah.
[19:36.480 --> 19:40.260]  We probably should. I'll be honest. It's been 24 hours and I'm already sick of talking about it.
[19:40.520 --> 19:46.360]  But we definitely should address it in the main podcast. If people aren't aware,
[19:46.640 --> 19:53.480]  our previous parent company, Rooster Teeth, the company that was around for about 22 years,
[19:53.480 --> 19:57.960]  went out of business last year. If you're listening to this, you probably are aware
[19:57.960 --> 20:02.600]  that we spun off and started our own company. Well, one of the other founders, Bernie,
[20:03.220 --> 20:08.760]  was able to acquire the name of Rooster Teeth and some of the intellectual property and has
[20:08.760 --> 20:15.340]  reformed the company in some manner that isn't entirely clear yet. They have more information
[20:15.340 --> 20:20.080]  coming. But a lot of people have been asking if this means that we will then be rejoining Rooster
[20:20.080 --> 20:25.400]  Teeth because we were once a part of Rooster Teeth and what that means for regulation.
[20:26.120 --> 20:31.560]  And what it means for regulation is that we are so fucking excited and happy for Bernie and Ashley
[20:31.560 --> 20:36.820]  and for Rooster Teeth and for the people that like Rooster Teeth content to be able to have that home
[20:36.820 --> 20:41.740]  on the internet again. But we aren't involved with it. We spent the last nine months creating
[20:41.740 --> 20:47.820]  our own company, carving out our own space on the internet, and building our own little self-contained
[20:47.820 --> 20:54.320]  universe. And we're very, very happy here and very excited about where we are and the direction
[20:54.320 --> 21:00.680]  that we're going and the adventure that we are on. And we will be tremendous fans of the new
[21:00.680 --> 21:05.860]  Rooster Teeth adventure and whatever direction that goes. And we will be friends of them. And
[21:05.860 --> 21:11.640]  I'm sure you will see us co-mingle at different points in the future. But we will be distinct and
[21:11.640 --> 21:17.500]  separate companies. And there's no... I don't think there's any plans for that to change
[21:18.100 --> 21:22.860]  anytime soon, if at all. No. Not at all. Not at all. Not at all. Zero. Yeah. Will not happen.
[21:23.360 --> 21:27.260]  I mean, if you want to get to the weeds of it, you know, I think I could take credit for that idea.
[21:28.120 --> 21:33.240]  Yeah, please do. For Bernie buying it. Floated it to him. Sent him a little message. I said,
[21:33.300 --> 21:38.340]  hey, you know what would be cool? You bought it. Bought some of the IP. And then it happened,
[21:38.340 --> 21:42.900]  so. I'm not saying that's a factual story that I just said, but if you want to give me credit,
[21:43.460 --> 21:49.720]  I'm open to it. I'm willing to take some. I'll credit to you, Andrew. Thank you so much for
[21:49.720 --> 21:53.440]  doing that. Yeah, I just like floating those ideas. You know, he was about the eighth person
[21:53.440 --> 21:59.320]  I texted saying, hey, you know what would be cool? Buying the RT property. If anybody else wants to
[21:59.320 --> 22:05.640]  has anything else they want to add or elucidate to that, or if I misframed anything, but I think
[22:05.640 --> 22:10.660]  just the general gist is that we are genuinely happy and excited. And I don't think anybody
[22:10.660 --> 22:16.520]  wanted Rooster Teeth to disappear from the Internet because of some Warner Brothers purge.
[22:16.700 --> 22:22.140]  So the fact that Bernie has it in some fashion and is able to keep it alive, I think is great.
[22:22.500 --> 22:28.120]  We were all there when it died. Like, clearly, we didn't want that to happen. We were all employed
[22:28.540 --> 22:37.540]  by it as it sank. Yeah, we had healthcare. I still do. Healthcare was cool. It still is.
[22:39.340 --> 22:44.860]  Anyway, yeah, there will be no collab between... I just think being definitive. There's no thought
[22:44.860 --> 22:49.000]  of one, at least. Yeah, I don't know what that would be. Like, we don't collab. People have been
[22:49.000 --> 22:52.560]  asking me a lot about it, and I get it. I totally understand that. We spent 22 years making content
[22:52.560 --> 22:55.960]  together. I would also point you to 22 years worth of content if you're looking for any,
[22:55.960 --> 22:59.300]  because we made a shitload of it. Like, if you started today, it would take you a decade to get
[22:59.300 --> 23:04.620]  through all the content Bernie and I made together. But we don't collaborate with anyone. Like, we
[23:04.620 --> 23:10.580]  don't have guests on the podcast. We never did. I dare say never will, you know? When we were at
[23:10.580 --> 23:17.040]  Rooster Teeth, we didn't have people on from Rooster Teeth on this. We've had one person come
[23:17.040 --> 23:22.400]  on, and they're delightful. They're so funny. Part of me, though, was like, we don't do this.
[23:22.400 --> 23:28.180]  We don't do this. I get it. Yeah, we had one person come on as a whim during the chip tasting,
[23:28.480 --> 23:35.120]  and I don't know that that'll ever happen again. It was great. It was fine. But we're pretty keyed
[23:35.120 --> 23:41.640]  into making what we're making with each other and only us, if that makes sense. Yeah, absolutely.
[23:41.840 --> 23:47.220]  I think that was really well said. I think that was great. Do we all have squinkles?
[23:47.220 --> 23:54.720]  I got my squinkles. I got my squinks. My squinkles are on the way. Are you fucking serious?
[23:56.100 --> 24:00.740]  This is a bit. You're doing a bit. Are you serious? Oh, hang on. Did they just get delivered?
[24:01.280 --> 24:08.140]  How are they not there? Dude, we took a break. We took a 90-minute break between our last recording.
[24:08.580 --> 24:12.900]  So you could get your squinkles. I Uber-eated a sandwich in that time. How could you not Uber-eat
[24:12.900 --> 24:20.480]  squinkles? I did. They're on the way. That's insane. Then why did we take the break? Because
[24:20.480 --> 24:26.140]  I was going to go, and they weren't at that store. Okay, fair enough. That, you know what,
[24:26.180 --> 24:32.000]  you really should have led with that. I agree with these other guys. You should have said that first.
[24:32.560 --> 24:38.180]  Nick, Nick, fire up the time machine. No. All right, all right. They're delivered anyway. They're
[24:38.180 --> 24:42.680]  here. I just didn't see. I didn't notice. Fair enough. Okay, go get your squinkles. Okay. Well,
[24:42.680 --> 24:46.340]  he gets those. Let me just say, a little communication could be nice. Gavin's come at
[24:46.340 --> 24:51.500]  me for a lack of communication. A little, hey, I went, they didn't have any. I'm going to order them.
[24:51.960 --> 24:58.500]  Gavin likes to start in, you start in the second act. Go get your squinkles. Okay. Go get your
[24:58.500 --> 25:04.320]  squiggles. I talked to Jeff about this yesterday. I said there are times where Gavin does stuff,
[25:04.380 --> 25:07.640]  and the way he presents a question, it's like he's waiting for you to walk into a trap,
[25:07.900 --> 25:12.000]  but that's never what he's actually doing. It just feels like it every time.
[25:12.380 --> 25:17.600]  It's a great example of that. God. He's not even going to like these squiggles. No. After all this,
[25:17.680 --> 25:20.540]  he's not going to like them. We're all going to hate him, and he's going to hate him twice as
[25:20.540 --> 25:25.180]  much. Oh, I think I'm going to like them. Eric, I was trying to answer your question as directly as
[25:25.180 --> 25:29.480]  possible. You said, does everyone have their squiggles? I'm telling you, no. Do you want to
[25:29.480 --> 25:38.960]  start with the story? The answer. I think the reason everyone was mad at you is that we took
[25:38.960 --> 25:44.800]  a 90-minute break for your answer to still be no. Well, yeah, but wouldn't it be annoying if
[25:44.800 --> 25:48.520]  you were like, do you ever have their squiggles? And I'm like, here's what happened. So I went to
[25:48.520 --> 25:57.960]  the... No. I don't have them. I do have them, though. I was wrong. Boo! Boo! So, Jeff, reset
[25:57.960 --> 26:06.140]  the squiggles stuff. Tell us about the squiggles. Okay, we are at the airport leaving Cancun. We've
[26:06.140 --> 26:17.060]  had an amazing four days together. Sun and fun and salt water and a lot of diarrhea and some
[26:17.060 --> 26:22.760]  pretty questionable evening entertainment. And now we're hanging out at the airport at Margaritaville
[26:22.760 --> 26:28.780]  waiting to come back to America. And we decide to walk to our gate and glance over to the right.
[26:28.780 --> 26:37.400]  And what do I see but a package of candy called Squinkles Chunks. And I thought to myself,
[26:37.500 --> 26:41.760]  that can't be real. So I go and I pick it up and I take a picture of it to go show Eric. And then
[26:41.760 --> 26:45.220]  he goes, that's the craziest thing I've ever seen. And then we get on a plane and go back to America.
[26:45.600 --> 26:51.100]  Very dumbly didn't buy the Squinkles Chunks. Thought the photo was enough. Don't know what
[26:51.100 --> 26:54.800]  was wrong with me there. Mentioned it on the podcast. Everybody's decided they want to try
[26:54.800 --> 27:00.260]  Squinkles. So then every week when we record the podcast, we all get ready to eat the Squinkles,
[27:00.420 --> 27:04.220]  but Gavin never has them. And I think this is like the ninth podcast in a row we've tried to do
[27:04.220 --> 27:09.880]  Squinkles. And now it sounds like Gavin has them. So we're all going to eat Squinkles and see what
[27:09.880 --> 27:14.340]  we think. Well, you kept changing the time of the podcast to be earlier than my Squinkle game.
[27:14.640 --> 27:23.000]  It's in two weeks! Two weeks! In between, go in between! In between the days? This is proof that
[27:23.460 --> 27:30.660]  I have my Squinkles with today's date. All right, I was not able to find Squinkles Chunks,
[27:30.920 --> 27:35.860]  but I got Squinklote and I got Squinkles Salsa Getty. I got Squinkles Salsa Getty.
[27:36.200 --> 27:41.160]  Okay, that's what I got. I also got Salsa Getty. I have Squinkles Chunks. They are not hard to find.
[27:41.320 --> 27:47.820]  They're at like Walgreens and CVS. I tried both of those stores, didn't have them. Wow. Is that
[27:47.820 --> 27:52.880]  what your clock looks like, Gavin? What is that? Yeah, that's my satellite clock. So I'm always
[27:52.880 --> 27:58.760]  on time exactly. I obviously didn't use it today. You were a minute late. Yeah, so that's how I get
[27:58.760 --> 28:02.740]  on time. Why do you put things of importance on the floor? You're shaving with a mirror on
[28:02.740 --> 28:06.520]  the floor. Your clock's on the floor. What are you doing? That's not the floor, that's a footstool.
[28:07.140 --> 28:12.080]  Okay. That's low, though. I apologize. That's not where I keep the clock. That's where I put the
[28:12.080 --> 28:17.200]  clock to take the picture. Oh, that's a nice chunk. That's what a Squinkles chunk looks like.
[28:17.460 --> 28:21.120]  It looks like dog food. It looks like a little cat treat. It does. It does look like a cat treat.
[28:22.980 --> 28:28.020]  How's the chunk? Oh, I love it. Good chunk. Really? What does it taste like?
[28:31.460 --> 28:36.240]  Tamarind and mango. Okay. And like almost like it's got like a little bit of like tahini and sugar.
[28:36.760 --> 28:42.380]  Like a little bit. Squinkles Salsaghetti looks kind of like somebody rolled red vines around in
[28:43.160 --> 28:50.540]  sand. It does. That is a great explanation. Like you dropped your red vines in the sand pit
[28:50.540 --> 28:54.440]  and you had to eat it anyway. We're going to we're getting into the Salsaghetti.
[28:54.820 --> 28:58.980]  Should we do it? Yeah, let's do it. All right. I'm excited about the little sauce packet. Open
[28:58.980 --> 29:02.220]  mine. Well, do you put it on it or is it on the side? What am I supposed to do with it?
[29:02.340 --> 29:05.580]  Sauce on the side? I feel like you probably put it on, I'd assume.
[29:06.180 --> 29:11.680]  So I'm opening. What is this? Soy? What is this? Yeah, it's soy. Gassano.
[29:12.500 --> 29:19.200]  On there. You know what? That's not half bad. Oh, that's thick.
[29:20.640 --> 29:22.680]  Yeah. Holy shit.
[29:24.360 --> 29:27.800]  Is it a little spicy? Yeah, got a little kick to it.
[29:28.940 --> 29:32.360]  What's that? I haven't used the brown sauce yet. What's the soy sauce like?
[29:32.780 --> 29:39.660]  Oh, I'm going to try some soy sauce. Jesus Christ. I think it's better without it.
[29:40.060 --> 29:45.440]  I bet the Salsaghetti or whatever is like a watermelon-y strawberry thing.
[29:45.440 --> 29:49.400]  And then the sauce is probably like a tamarind flavor thing.
[29:49.640 --> 29:52.560]  Yeah, it's very watermelon. That's great. That's really good.
[29:53.540 --> 29:58.020]  Dude, I'm a squinkle guy. These squinkles chunks are so good.
[29:58.180 --> 30:00.440]  So your squinkles chunks kind of taste, you said they're mango?
[30:00.980 --> 30:04.420]  Yeah, they're definitely mango and like tamarind, like a little bit tamarind.
[30:04.800 --> 30:11.560]  Dude, squinkle Salsaghetti is fucking good. Yeah, you ever eat something and all you can
[30:11.560 --> 30:15.760]  taste is just the fact that your body probably can't make use of any of this?
[30:16.320 --> 30:18.440]  Oh, yeah. Yeah. McDonald's.
[30:18.540 --> 30:22.520]  That's what it tastes like. I mean, it tastes like every
[30:23.680 --> 30:28.900]  Mexican candy I would get growing up as a kid. I really like it. Yeah, yeah. This just tastes like
[30:28.900 --> 30:31.760]  it tastes like all of that. Easy. Super easy to eat.
[30:32.160 --> 30:34.580]  Not a candy guy. I'm a squinker. I think I am.
[30:35.000 --> 30:38.380]  I'm a squinker. Yeah, I'm a squink fan from here on out.
[30:38.380 --> 30:41.520]  Hey, I got a gift for you next week.
[30:42.660 --> 30:45.760]  I'll take any extra squinks off your hands for you.
[30:45.920 --> 30:47.180]  I got the five packets.
[30:51.120 --> 30:54.320]  Wow, you went all in. Yeah, I ordered what was available.
[30:54.760 --> 30:59.980]  Speaking of going all in, can I tell you guys a little story about going all in without realizing
[30:59.980 --> 31:01.140]  it over the weekend? Please.
[31:02.080 --> 31:06.260]  Last Friday. This is a follow up to my dick story. This is kind of dog related.
[31:06.940 --> 31:11.200]  Last Friday, Emily and I had to take little Albert to the
[31:13.900 --> 31:20.340]  allergy specialist, right? Because he's, you know, he's a little nerd and he's got a billion
[31:20.340 --> 31:26.160]  allergies. And it's just been a problem with being an English Bulldog, right? Henry had all the same
[31:26.160 --> 31:30.820]  shit. And so we had to take him up there because he has to get shots. I have to personally,
[31:31.240 --> 31:35.760]  because Emily can't do it. She's too grossed out by it. I have to give him two shots every three
[31:35.760 --> 31:40.200]  days for the next hundred years. And then at some point he'll be no longer be allergic to
[31:40.200 --> 31:46.900]  outside, I guess. But anyway, so we had to go all the way up to Round Rock to this allergy
[31:46.900 --> 31:53.440]  specialist to go get the medicine and everything. And it just so happens that right next door to it,
[31:53.520 --> 31:58.700]  you have to actually, the way it's at like a cul-de-sac or some sort of like a traffic circle
[31:58.700 --> 32:04.940]  off of 35 in Round Rock where you end up, you have to go through a Freddy's fast food restaurant to
[32:04.940 --> 32:10.000]  get back to the main road after you go to the allergy place. And I've never been to a Freddy's,
[32:10.300 --> 32:14.440]  but it had a nice sign. And I was like, hey, do you want to get some food? And nobody was like,
[32:14.500 --> 32:17.600]  yeah, let's get some food from that place. And so we went through the drive-through,
[32:17.700 --> 32:20.720]  they had hot dogs. So I was like, obviously I'm going to get a chili cheese dog, right?
[32:20.740 --> 32:24.580]  I showed you guys a picture of it. It was number 38 on the list, I believe, 38 or 39.
[32:26.020 --> 32:30.240]  And they asked me, they said, what would you like, sir? And I said, I'll take a chili cheese
[32:30.240 --> 32:33.640]  dog. And they said, do you want onions on that? And I went, well, yeah, of course. And they go,
[32:33.640 --> 32:38.640]  okay. And then they said, ma'am, what would you like? And she was like, I'll have a cheeseburger.
[32:38.920 --> 32:41.780]  And they're like, just like the number one or whatever. And they're like, okay,
[32:41.780 --> 32:46.440]  do you want onions on that? And she was like, yeah, it comes with it. Like, okay. And then
[32:46.440 --> 32:54.060]  they give us our food and we go pull into the parking lot and eat. And my hot dog is swimming
[32:54.060 --> 32:57.060]  in onions. And we're like, well, they went a little heavy on the onions, huh? And Emily's like,
[32:57.060 --> 33:04.280]  I swear, it's just, it's just like patty, cheese, onion, mustard, and bun, but mostly onion.
[33:04.600 --> 33:08.560]  And we kind of laugh about it and we eat it. And then we throw the bag away immediately in
[33:08.560 --> 33:13.440]  the parking lot. There's a trash can and go home, go into the house, go about our business,
[33:13.800 --> 33:21.100]  go back into the car to leave. And the car smells so intensely like onion. We can't be in it with
[33:21.100 --> 33:26.340]  the windows rolled up. And we're like, holy shit. How did it get so oniony in here? This is crazy.
[33:26.340 --> 33:30.760]  How did we not notice it last time? And so we go do our business. We have to drive around town with
[33:30.760 --> 33:35.600]  the windows down. We go to our business. We come home. We leave the windows down. We're like, yeah,
[33:35.600 --> 33:39.300]  we'll just leave the windows down for a while. I'm sure it'll be fine. That began a saga of us
[33:39.300 --> 33:47.380]  trying to get the onion smell out of our car that has not ended. No, I don't know. Under Emily's car
[33:47.380 --> 33:54.200]  right now are like seven air fresheners, like leather scent air fresheners. We had the, I drove
[33:54.200 --> 34:00.980]  the car around on Sunday for like an hour with every window down intently just to get breezing.
[34:01.460 --> 34:09.020]  On Sunday day, I left it in the yard with every window down and the rear trunk up for like nine
[34:09.020 --> 34:16.920]  hours. We sprayed, we for breezed, we vacuumed to see if there were onions that fell somewhere.
[34:17.120 --> 34:24.180]  We cannot get onion out of this goddamn car. We've made tremendous progress. But let me tell
[34:24.180 --> 34:30.860]  you, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, you couldn't sit in the car. That's crazy. I've never
[34:30.860 --> 34:37.660]  seen anything like it in my entire life where the onion scent transference was so strong. It just,
[34:37.900 --> 34:44.740]  it just like imbued itself into the inner workings of the car. You couldn't have made it smell more
[34:44.740 --> 34:51.100]  like onions if you chopped up an onion and just shoved it into the air vent. It was insane. It's
[34:51.100 --> 34:57.040]  still insane. Do you think some onion did get in the vent? No, how's onion gonna get in the vent?
[34:58.960 --> 35:06.020]  You've seen me eat. It's not that messy. Do you think a worse smell would stack with the onion
[35:06.020 --> 35:11.380]  or would it displace the onion? Like if you went full windows up canister strumming sort of thing,
[35:11.480 --> 35:15.460]  would it blast the onion out? I don't think so. I don't think anything is getting rid of this
[35:15.460 --> 35:20.320]  onion. This onion has taken hold of my wife's car and it's not letting go. It's like,
[35:20.320 --> 35:26.000]  it's like a demon onion. It's like we need to have some sort of an onion exorcism. I don't know
[35:26.000 --> 35:33.380]  what else to do. The car has been aired out for like 16 hours of Texas air straight. It just it,
[35:33.500 --> 35:39.300]  it won't go away. I want to come and puff some of this onion. All right. The only solution is to
[35:39.300 --> 35:46.080]  have Gavin come over, have a sleepover, fill that gut up with air, and then let him go fart crazy
[35:46.080 --> 35:51.400]  in this car. Start pushing those scents around. I think you might be able to feed it. I'll sleep
[35:51.400 --> 35:56.940]  in the car. Do you have a USB plug for my seat? Yeah, we do. I'm willing to try it, man. I'm
[35:56.940 --> 36:00.280]  willing to try it. I wish it smelled as bad as it did initially. You can still smell it now,
[36:00.320 --> 36:04.100]  but it's also the thing where like, do I smell onions or am I just convinced that I smell onions?
[36:04.580 --> 36:09.160]  But I definitely think we still smell them. Yeah. You need to make like popcorn in the car. You need
[36:09.160 --> 36:16.340]  to get an air popper in there. You need to just try to overpower it. What if we all sit in the
[36:16.340 --> 36:21.780]  car? There's five seats, right? Yeah. And we'll all do a different task in the car that makes a
[36:21.780 --> 36:27.300]  nicer smell. I'll tell you what, let me get in there this weekend and see how bad it is.
[36:27.580 --> 36:31.160]  And maybe that's a supplemental we can film. We could do a popcorn in one seat. Maybe I
[36:31.160 --> 36:38.440]  could get some bacon going in a different seat. I did. I actually did. This is something maybe
[36:38.440 --> 36:46.520]  we could try. On Monday, I had to go back up to the allergists because one of the vials
[36:46.520 --> 36:51.940]  cracked and all the fucking, I don't know, whatever it is, medicine fell out. And so I
[36:51.940 --> 36:56.460]  had to go make an emergency run. And I was like, you know what I'm going to do? Because I was in
[36:56.460 --> 37:01.960]  my car. I was like, I'm going to get the same order and I'm going to eat it in the parking lot.
[37:02.040 --> 37:06.780]  I'm going to eat both orders since I'm by myself. And then I'm going to see if it was a one-time
[37:06.780 --> 37:14.720]  thing or if it's something else that just like simultaneously made an onion smell,
[37:14.800 --> 37:17.900]  like some problem with the engine or something that we're attributing to the onions, but it's
[37:17.900 --> 37:22.820]  not, you know, or like whatever. And I was all set to do it. And I even told Emily, I'm going
[37:22.820 --> 37:25.500]  to do this. She's like, that's a terrible idea. You shouldn't do it. This has been a nightmare
[37:25.500 --> 37:30.640]  for us. And I'm like, I know, but I got to know. I got to know. I got to know whether you onioned
[37:30.640 --> 37:37.340]  the car or not. So I drive because it's like fucking 40 minutes up to Round Rock to go do
[37:37.340 --> 37:42.700]  this. Right. I drive up there to go get the vial and the goddamn Freddy's wasn't open yet because I
[37:42.700 --> 37:46.720]  drove out there too early in the morning because I'm a morning guy and I didn't realize that they
[37:46.720 --> 37:53.760]  don't open till like 11. So I couldn't perform the test, but maybe, maybe that's what we do.
[37:53.860 --> 37:57.480]  Maybe that's our supplemental. I'm not trying to step on a hundred percent eats territory or
[37:57.480 --> 38:02.840]  anything, but maybe we should try to onion out the car and see if we can destroy my car with
[38:02.840 --> 38:06.480]  onion. See if we can replicate what happened to Emily's car. We should do this tomorrow.
[38:07.220 --> 38:11.740]  Well, I'm certainly okay with that. Go and onion the car and then we'll all try and de-onion the
[38:11.740 --> 38:18.020]  car. Okay. I support it. Uh, you guys will have to schedule that. Do it after the game stuff.
[38:19.100 --> 38:22.440]  Gavin won't show up if it's not on the calendar. That's true. I forgot about
[38:22.440 --> 38:28.380]  recording yesterday because it wasn't on the calendar. We'll figure it out.
[38:28.400 --> 38:32.920]  The worst thing is that usually when I'm late or I've just forgotten about something, I'm right here
[38:32.920 --> 38:37.340]  just working at my desk. Like I don't have to physically move anywhere. I'm just being late
[38:37.340 --> 38:45.060]  in the right place. I really, I'm not a negative review food place guy, but if I read a review for
[38:45.060 --> 38:53.220]  restaurant that said, do not go here. The onion is so strong. It has taken over the scent of my
[38:53.220 --> 38:57.500]  car for the past two weeks. I'm going to that place. I need to figure out what's going on with
[38:57.500 --> 39:02.580]  these onions. If you guys can't get the onions out, you need to go to the restaurant and just
[39:02.580 --> 39:06.920]  interview. What are you doing? What are, what are these onions? Where are you importing these from?
[39:08.260 --> 39:12.880]  Oh man, we need to do a deep dive on onions. I'm, I'm, I'm glad we're going to go do this. I
[39:12.880 --> 39:16.300]  really am. Whether we do it tomorrow or sometime in the future, I really, I do want to get to the
[39:16.300 --> 39:22.120]  bottom of it and, and I'm prepared to sacrifice Gavin's car to do it. Yeah. And I think, I think
[39:22.120 --> 39:26.880]  my thing, I'm going to cook bacon in my seat. Okay. And then everyone can come up with a different
[39:26.880 --> 39:33.540]  task for Eric and Nick. Do you, do you have any ideas? I'm sure we can land on something. I'm
[39:33.540 --> 39:38.480]  just looking at the calendar. We're not going to be able to do it tomorrow, but. How many USB plugs
[39:38.480 --> 39:44.280]  do you have in the car, Jeff? How many devices could be possibly plugged in? I have, well, I
[39:44.280 --> 39:50.180]  have, I have one and I have wireless charging. Well, I can bring my, I can bring my battery
[39:50.180 --> 39:54.500]  that will power four or five things. Oh yeah. That's a good call. You can have your little
[39:54.500 --> 40:01.580]  battery. Do you guys ever think about bandanas? Only when I'm looking at Marcus Fenix. Outside
[40:01.580 --> 40:06.600]  of that, no. But I think about them a lot when I'm looking at Marcus Fenix. I was thinking about
[40:06.600 --> 40:10.000]  bandanas the other day. And I was thinking, so I did a little research because I was like,
[40:10.060 --> 40:13.820]  who invented the bandana, right? This was a so all right thing. That's not going to, I'm not
[40:13.820 --> 40:18.680]  going to do for so all right. But, and bandanas were invented like in India, I want to say like
[40:18.680 --> 40:23.960]  a billion years ago. Right. And they were invented to do what you would think to, to cover your neck,
[40:24.360 --> 40:29.080]  protect your neck and to tie your hair back. Right. And I got to thinking about cowboys and
[40:29.080 --> 40:34.700]  how cowboys used bandanas mostly when they're riding their horses to stop from breathing in
[40:34.700 --> 40:41.740]  dust and shit. Right. I figured they were probably the first people to wear a bandana up over their
[40:41.740 --> 40:47.320]  nose to cover their mouth, which got me thinking, who was the first guy? Cause there must have been
[40:47.320 --> 40:52.720]  a first guy who like put his bandana up with his buddy. Cause they were going to go, you know,
[40:52.800 --> 40:57.300]  drive right on down to the next town. And he goes, you know what, Steve, with that bandana up,
[40:57.360 --> 41:02.800]  I, you could be anybody. I couldn't tell who you were. If you went and robbed a bank right now,
[41:02.800 --> 41:07.500]  nobody would know it was Steve. You're completely anonymous. And then somebody was like,
[41:07.600 --> 41:13.900]  that is true with a bandana up over my nose. I'm anonymous. I can commit crimes. And then all
[41:13.900 --> 41:18.640]  crimes were committed in the cowboy days by people who wore bandanas over their face. So I wonder if
[41:18.640 --> 41:28.260]  the guy who invented bandana crime knows what he did going forward. You think the bandana was the
[41:28.260 --> 41:34.460]  first face covering crime? Might've been. That's interesting. Whether it was the first face cover
[41:34.460 --> 41:39.500]  crime or not, there was a first person who said, I'm going to use it for this reason. And then
[41:39.500 --> 41:46.140]  let's be honest. Bandanas are iconic with robbing banks now, right? When I think of a bandana,
[41:46.180 --> 41:53.280]  I think of a cowboy robbing a stage coach or a bank. And that had to start somewhere.
[41:53.880 --> 41:56.680]  It probably started with a cloth. Do you think there was intentionality
[41:56.680 --> 42:02.540]  to it? Or do you think it was like, let's say a crew of four people. And one of them is like,
[42:02.700 --> 42:07.980]  you see what you see, John is going to fucking wear his bandana. And that guy refuses to take
[42:07.980 --> 42:12.600]  that bandana off. He thinks it's so cool. What an idiot. He looks so dumb. And then the three of
[42:12.600 --> 42:17.360]  them get identified immediately. And nobody fucking knows who the fourth guy is. And then
[42:17.360 --> 42:21.500]  that's the lightbulb moment. He's the guy who figured it out. He's like the wet bandits. He's
[42:21.500 --> 42:26.320]  the bandana bandit. Yeah. It feels to me like a thing where it happened and then there was a
[42:26.320 --> 42:31.200]  result and they went, oh, shit, we can use it like this as opposed to someone being like,
[42:31.240 --> 42:36.440]  I can cover. I'll be anonymous. I'll never arrest me. There was a moment, though. You're absolutely
[42:36.440 --> 42:41.100]  right, Andrew. There was a lightbulb moment. For all I know, bandit is it comes from the word
[42:41.100 --> 42:45.540]  bandana. Do you think there's ever been a police lineup where all five of the people in the lineup
[42:45.540 --> 42:52.980]  are wearing bandanas? Oh, I guarantee. Yeah, absolutely. Let's try and identify. That's
[42:52.980 --> 43:00.200]  funny. I never considered the bandana history, Jeff. Yeah, I I got that. I got thinking about
[43:00.200 --> 43:03.920]  it the other day and I just couldn't stop thinking about like that. Whoever that person was who was
[43:03.920 --> 43:09.660]  like, I'm going to rob this fucking stagecoach. You know, it was me. I'll never forget. And
[43:09.660 --> 43:13.340]  then everybody's like, that's brilliant. I'm going to do that, too. I wonder if it created criminals.
[43:15.720 --> 43:20.260]  I never would have done this in a million years. But now it's like people being trolls on the
[43:20.260 --> 43:27.360]  internet, like nobody's going to like it. Man, if only I could do this anonymously, I would be the
[43:27.360 --> 43:33.960]  biggest son of a bitch. Wait a minute. You think there was like a corner store where like they
[43:33.960 --> 43:38.240]  couldn't keep bandanas in stock? It's like, oh, I'm really worried about what's going to happen
[43:38.240 --> 43:43.160]  in this town. These are flying off the shelf. Do you think anyone ever robbed the store they
[43:43.160 --> 43:48.820]  bought the bandana from? Yeah. You know, there was a guy who was selling it to him, too, who was like,
[43:48.820 --> 43:54.140]  I'm going to remember your face and your face. And then there's no fucking cameras. So he's like,
[43:54.160 --> 43:59.100]  he's got his partner has to draw every person that comes in and buys a bandana just so they
[43:59.100 --> 44:02.780]  have a record. He just draws everyone from the eyes to the top of the head.

[44:49.960 --> 44:54.640]  I came up recently with what I think is going to be a good invention. This is probably some lab
[44:54.640 --> 45:01.040]  work, but it's advanced lab. Like I don't have these skills. Sure. But I feel like I'm at a
[45:01.040 --> 45:07.540]  certain age. I'm of an age where this would come in handy. I want to place a little fist on,
[45:08.380 --> 45:14.060]  on like a bidet attachment. You know, when, when the thing comes out and it squirts water
[45:14.060 --> 45:19.560]  into your anus. Yeah. I want just a little fist on the end of that to just knuckle the back of
[45:19.560 --> 45:24.380]  my balls a little bit. I hate it. I hate everything you're saying. I didn't know. You said fists and
[45:24.380 --> 45:27.440]  I didn't know where any of this was going. Yeah. I didn't think it was going to be that. I didn't
[45:27.440 --> 45:33.420]  think you want to bolt like speed bag your sack, but. Can you explain that again so I make sure I
[45:33.420 --> 45:38.580]  understand what you're saying? Well, sometimes when I stand up and I've done, I've done a piss,
[45:38.980 --> 45:43.080]  like if I sat down to pee and I stand up, sometimes it's just like a little in the pipes
[45:43.080 --> 45:48.240]  and I've got to just move some stuff around to get all the drips out. And I feel like if that
[45:48.240 --> 45:52.880]  was automated, that'd be real nice. That's going to be a, that's a short-term solution for a
[45:52.880 --> 45:57.900]  problem that's only going to get worse as you age. There aren't enough little fists in the world to
[45:57.900 --> 46:02.540]  punch your balls enough to get all the pee trapped in there. By the time you're like my age, dude,
[46:02.540 --> 46:08.120]  it's just a constant dribble. It's like a, it's like a, it's like a fucking yard hose that won't
[46:08.120 --> 46:13.700]  fully turn off. So you're just like constantly throughout the day leaking piss? Nah, but for like
[46:13.700 --> 46:18.720]  maybe a minute, there's like a danger zone of like a minute after I pee where I have to like think
[46:18.720 --> 46:22.880]  like, do I need to go back to the bathroom and try again just in case? And there's all, and if I do,
[46:22.920 --> 46:26.680]  there's always a little bit more. And if I don't, I'm always like, well, I'll change my pants.
[46:26.720 --> 46:31.880]  Because for me, it's, I'm only trapping piss when my balls are in hang mode, but whenever they're
[46:32.620 --> 46:36.380]  lifted up again by the boxers, that's when the rest comes out. And I'm just sick of it.
[46:36.780 --> 46:43.580]  I would say piss is the thing that changes the most with age. Honestly. I pee, I was thinking
[46:43.580 --> 46:49.620]  about this the other day. I want to start recording it. I pee now, like every one of my pees is longer
[46:49.620 --> 46:54.680]  than my previous longest pee from my twenties or thirties. It's just like every time I piss,
[46:54.700 --> 46:58.620]  it's like a camel now. I don't know where it comes from. I don't know why. It doesn't matter if I pee
[46:58.620 --> 47:05.520]  twice a day or 18 times a day. And there's always just like, just like the dribbliest of dribbles
[47:05.520 --> 47:11.780]  for a while. It's all. And this is for every one of you dudes. It only gets worse. I don't want to
[47:11.780 --> 47:17.660]  sugar coat it for you because it definitely sucks. You've definitely not want to sugar coat.
[47:17.840 --> 47:24.420]  I'm at the point now where I would say maybe once every three weeks, I'm changing my boxes after a
[47:25.240 --> 47:30.840]  week. Oh, that's so funny. Enjoy it while you can.
[47:32.100 --> 47:38.380]  Oh man. Maybe I need to do some, uh, like, well, what's the clenchy thing that like...
[47:38.380 --> 47:38.800]  Kegels?
[47:39.120 --> 47:40.980]  Yeah. Maybe I need to do some of those too.
[47:41.300 --> 47:41.900]  Oh, maybe.
[47:42.580 --> 47:45.180]  But yeah, at the moment I'm just having to get down there and sort of
[47:45.180 --> 47:47.260]  nurse the balls around a little bit just to get it all out.
[47:48.640 --> 47:51.160]  And I think if that was automated, it'd be phenomenal.
[47:54.820 --> 47:56.880]  I think you should. I think you should try it.
[47:56.980 --> 47:57.860]  Would you use it, Jeff?
[47:58.380 --> 48:01.780]  Yeah, I would definitely try it. I just, I think that, and the whole point that I was
[48:01.780 --> 48:06.900]  trying to make is that I think I'm beyond getting use out of it. Like it, it's like
[48:06.900 --> 48:11.700]  it would maybe handle 20% of the problem, but I still got to deal with the other 80% after,
[48:11.860 --> 48:15.480]  you know, but for the window that you're in right now, I bet that would work very well.
[48:15.720 --> 48:19.140]  Yeah. Maybe it would do me for 10 years. And then, then I'm just beyond repair.
[48:19.140 --> 48:23.840]  I have a sole right idea for you, Jeff. I've been sitting on for a while.
[48:24.020 --> 48:24.320]  Okay.
[48:24.400 --> 48:28.120]  You'll like it. It's going to do some, take some research. You've been talking,
[48:28.320 --> 48:32.920]  you know, about all-star players not playing and how much money they make in the NBA.
[48:33.840 --> 48:40.600]  I'd love to know if there is a player that is making like 60 million and is just a bench player
[48:40.600 --> 48:46.920]  at this point. If there is a time in the NBA's history in which him sitting as an individual
[48:47.480 --> 48:51.600]  is making more money than the entire roster of a championship team.
[48:51.680 --> 48:54.680]  And like the seventies or the like sixties.
[48:55.220 --> 48:58.360]  I don't think it would have been in the sixties or the seventies because there weren't pay
[48:58.360 --> 49:02.120]  disparities like there are now. There just wasn't money in the league like there is now.
[49:02.480 --> 49:07.260]  There'd be a much greater chance of it happening in 2024 or 2025 than any other time I'd say.
[49:07.720 --> 49:13.320]  No, I'm saying like, if you take the roster of every player from 1970 and you add it up,
[49:13.880 --> 49:18.060]  is it less than the amount that they're paying this one guy to not play?
[49:18.260 --> 49:19.460]  Like every player in the league?
[49:19.740 --> 49:22.680]  No, every player on the team that won the championship that year.
[49:22.800 --> 49:28.100]  So you take the roster of the winning team. I just, the idea of that, like you're paying
[49:28.780 --> 49:35.140]  more to one guy to not play than a team paid all of their guys that won a championship is
[49:35.140 --> 49:37.580]  very funny to me. I'm curious if that has ever happened.
[49:37.860 --> 49:41.560]  I guarantee you it probably has, but I'll look into it. I'll definitely look into it.
[49:41.560 --> 49:46.380]  You mentioned that and there was like some big NBA news this week that kind of like,
[49:46.600 --> 49:52.380]  I think it exploded to such a degree that it was bigger than NBA. Like it was invading my wife's
[49:52.380 --> 49:56.220]  TikTok and like I had to explain to Vanessa what was going on. She's like, why am I getting
[49:56.220 --> 50:01.100]  inundated with this Luka Doncic shit, you know? But there was a huge NBA trade this week where
[50:01.100 --> 50:05.680]  Luka Doncic was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers for a guy named Anthony Davis and people are up
[50:05.680 --> 50:10.740]  in arms about it, myself included. But what I want to talk to you guys about is when it happened
[50:10.740 --> 50:14.960]  Saturday night, kind of in the middle of nowhere or like out of the middle of nowhere, I was playing
[50:14.960 --> 50:20.400]  Call of Duty. And so I watched SportsCenter and I was like consuming all the media I could. And
[50:20.400 --> 50:26.060]  then I was just about to go to bed. And at like 1.30 in the morning, I got an alert from my phone
[50:26.060 --> 50:31.460]  that there was an emergency Bill Simmons podcast to discuss the Luka Doncic trade.
[50:31.740 --> 50:35.220]  And so I thought, oh fuck, I got to stay up and listen to this. This is what I've been waiting for.
[50:35.340 --> 50:39.700]  And then so from 1.30 to like 2.45 or whatever, I listened to that podcast and then I went to bed.
[50:39.700 --> 50:46.340]  And that got me thinking we should do an emergency podcast one day about something. I love it.
[50:48.300 --> 50:51.860]  Preferably something we don't know anything about. But yeah, like I just want us to have
[50:51.860 --> 50:55.340]  to do an emergency podcast one night where we all have to get together at 1 a.m. and
[50:55.340 --> 51:01.280]  like and talk about it, you know. We should all install a siren in our house that's linked to the
[51:01.280 --> 51:08.100]  same like button press. And if you hear the siren, you have to start podcasting. We should be able to
[51:08.100 --> 51:14.060]  rig that up, right? I could rig that up. Yeah. Yeah. I take Eric's silence to mean he's on board.
[51:14.580 --> 51:20.160]  Oh, you know, I'm I'm I'm for any good idea, guys. I'm just trying to it would be.
[51:21.320 --> 51:22.560]  Take that how you will.
[51:25.900 --> 51:33.640]  I wish that we were friends with like a Shands type person, like an insider, a sports insider
[51:33.640 --> 51:40.020]  to be like when this trade happens, maybe like two seconds before you post about it.
[51:40.200 --> 51:45.760]  Hit this button. Let us know. Have the light go off. Like I'm trying to figure out what would
[51:45.760 --> 51:53.640]  be the thing that unites us for this emergency reaction. What's a fun emergency? Sports have
[51:53.640 --> 51:59.780]  fun emergencies. There has to be other things that also have fun emergencies. What's the most
[51:59.780 --> 52:06.080]  fun emergency? Like a surprise iPhone drop or something. Oh, you know, sometimes they're like,
[52:06.160 --> 52:11.620]  and it's available right now. Yeah. But maybe for like something none of us follow. Right. Yeah.
[52:11.740 --> 52:16.820]  It's got to be something none of us follow. Yeah. That's a good thing to think about.
[52:17.300 --> 52:21.380]  Something coming out would be cool. Like what if what if it was like, hey, Elder Scrolls six came
[52:21.380 --> 52:28.180]  out? But we'll all know about that. Or do you want to like the the emergency aspect of it is,
[52:28.180 --> 52:33.980]  I don't think delivering on that. Yeah, I got to agree. That's just us doing a recording about
[52:33.980 --> 52:39.380]  Elder Scrolls coming out when it comes out. Because I'm not opposed to. But if it came out now, like
[52:39.380 --> 52:45.880]  right this second, shouldn't we start playing it? Yeah. If it's if it comes out as a surprise.
[52:46.840 --> 52:51.240]  I've played GTA five while this podcast is happening. That game came out 10 years ago.
[52:51.360 --> 52:57.100]  I'm ready for a new release. What's funny is that the I think the announcement for Elder Scrolls six
[52:57.760 --> 53:01.720]  between then and now is longer than when Skyrim came out and that announcement.
[53:02.880 --> 53:08.360]  Jesus. Yeah. So all they really told us with that announcement was that the number after five is
[53:08.360 --> 53:13.640]  six. That's all the information we got. They clearly haven't didn't start working on it.
[53:14.240 --> 53:20.460]  Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think they planned on. Yeah, it's a weird time over there.
[53:21.420 --> 53:26.420]  Starfield, I think, was going to have a lot longer of a tale than I think it will end up having.
[53:27.100 --> 53:31.660]  Yeah, I agree with that. I need to play that DLC. Really good first mission, that DLC.
[53:32.360 --> 53:36.340]  We have this fucking deja vu. Did we talk about this yesterday? Yep.
[53:36.900 --> 53:44.060]  Oh, man. Anyway, I guess until we figure out what it is, everybody just keep your eyes peeled for
[53:44.060 --> 53:48.300]  an emergency. And if anything pops up and you're like, holy shit, that was unexpected, maybe we
[53:48.300 --> 53:54.360]  can assemble. I think if you have a suggestion as a listener as well, please let us know.
[53:54.360 --> 53:59.480]  This is like getting creative with it. Anything that we could have like a news alert for on a
[53:59.480 --> 54:07.600]  phone would be ideal of just it pops and then we all have to go. Gavin, you need to construct an
[54:07.600 --> 54:12.340]  alarm system or something because I have my alerts off at all times. So I'm going to miss this
[54:12.340 --> 54:17.380]  emergency alert. Yeah. Is there a reason that you just never have alerts on for anything?
[54:18.100 --> 54:24.140]  I just I don't really notice when it vibrates. I don't like the noise my phone makes when it
[54:24.140 --> 54:30.420]  has an alert. Yeah, but do you not think that every day where we're like, hey, can we can we
[54:30.420 --> 54:35.160]  do this or can we change this? No, it's because the four of us all say sure. And then you don't
[54:35.160 --> 54:41.040]  reply for 80 minutes. It's probably because I'm sleeping. If that happens at like 2 p.m.
[54:42.300 --> 54:46.680]  Or if I'm sick. Yeah. I mean, I'm sick. Yeah. I mean, yeah. 2 p.m. here. That's
[54:46.680 --> 54:53.500]  noon Pacific. What do you mean? What do you mean? Why? He sends us 80 percent of my slacks from
[54:53.500 --> 55:00.700]  Andrew at five in the morning. Yeah. Like he keeps odd hours. Sleep at night. I would love to.
[55:02.040 --> 55:08.080]  He sleeps to the beat of his own drummer. Maybe when you injured your shoulder, was that in a
[55:08.080 --> 55:14.440]  night's sleep or a day's sleep? It's a great question. I think I think it was like probably
[55:14.440 --> 55:19.900]  10 p.m. It was a night's sleep. OK, man, if you if you wore an aura ring,
[55:19.940 --> 55:33.120]  it wouldn't know what the fuck to do with you. Change everything. Stop whatever this is.
[55:33.320 --> 55:38.460]  The ring would be like human malfunctioning. Please remove me. I can be of no help.
[55:38.720 --> 55:41.940]  We should get you out and see if you can be the first person to score a one for asleep.
[55:44.440 --> 55:51.460]  Dude, I would love to see Andrew sleep score. We'll do it. So you're saying that you have your
[55:51.460 --> 55:59.560]  alerts off because you don't like when your alerts go off? Yeah. No one likes it. Yeah. I'm never like
[55:59.560 --> 56:05.060]  sick. Yeah. So turn it off. They're called alerts. They alert you. They're not called feel goods.
[56:05.380 --> 56:11.880]  Like I check my phone constantly. So I see you brought up that like I've been delayed. First of
[56:11.880 --> 56:17.600]  all, this is a democracy of a company we have. You technically don't need my vote. Oh, there are
[56:17.600 --> 56:21.820]  things where I'm not. I'm not moving forward until I hear from everyone. We like to check in with you
[56:21.820 --> 56:26.840]  and make sure you're good with tons of stuff. And sometimes we'll be talking in Slack. You'll be
[56:26.840 --> 56:31.800]  talking in Slack. And then someone will ask a question about the schedule, like maybe 10 minutes
[56:31.800 --> 56:36.660]  later. And we don't hear from you for like two hours. Yes, that it's that has been funny. And
[56:36.660 --> 56:41.760]  then because then I'll get a text from Gavin and he'll just say, what happened? It's also not
[56:41.760 --> 56:47.780]  always purely a yes or no. Sometimes your insights are invaluable. Yeah. Yeah. We'd like to see your
[56:47.780 --> 56:53.580]  opinion on stuff that you're even in. I just I want I want it noted that the man that had two
[56:53.580 --> 57:00.300]  weeks to get squinkels is coming at me right now about me being timely. He's got you there. Damn,
[57:00.320 --> 57:07.140]  you just got squinked, bro. You really dropped the squink on that one, Gavin. No, you squinked the
[57:07.140 --> 57:11.300]  ball. That's better. We film videos in the morning and then we film the podcast much later in the
[57:11.300 --> 57:15.340]  afternoon. I assume I'm just going to go and get the squinks between and you keep moving the podcast
[57:15.340 --> 57:21.760]  up, stepping on my time, doing it literally any other day at any other time for other days. I'm
[57:21.760 --> 57:27.360]  doing other things. Oh, my God. You're not doing other things. You said that when you have stuff
[57:27.360 --> 57:32.460]  going on, you're typically just at the desk you're at right now. Yeah. I mean, I could have stopped
[57:32.460 --> 57:36.160]  editing Pineapple Donut and got a squink. But guess what? I was editing the video that comes
[57:36.160 --> 57:41.480]  out tomorrow. But you didn't even go to get squinks. I did. They weren't there. They didn't
[57:41.480 --> 57:50.500]  sell any. Why did you look before you went? I should have. We put out a video. You should have.
[57:52.020 --> 57:56.040]  Sometimes you're just wrong, but I get the fight. I respect fighting and knowing internally you're
[57:56.040 --> 58:01.640]  wrong. But I'm back to the corner. If, Andrew, if the mind table is where it was last week,
[58:01.700 --> 58:05.600]  where's the corner? I don't know how to answer that question. What do you mean?
[58:05.600 --> 58:16.960]  Okay. Um, I'm locked in on my sleep for a second. I got a call from Eric one day and I went, oh,
[58:17.200 --> 58:22.580]  fuck, what happened? And it was the day you guys were filming the agility thing. And I was like,
[58:22.640 --> 58:28.280]  I why did I get a call? I wonder what happened. What did I need? And in the video, you guys have
[58:28.280 --> 58:33.380]  a wheel. And one of the things you talk about is call Andrew. And then it's cut me getting called
[58:33.380 --> 58:38.920]  because I didn't answer. And I assume it was nothing, but I spent at least a week going,
[58:39.120 --> 58:42.500]  I wonder what the call was about. Cause we never talked about it. I never asked.
[58:42.960 --> 58:47.360]  I was curious. Did you see it in the moment and just decide not to answer it or you just missed
[58:47.360 --> 58:52.580]  the call? I missed the call. Okay. But, uh, it was funny to watch the video and see you guys set
[58:52.580 --> 58:58.820]  up a wheel and then the edit of like never calling me. Uh, but knowing the call happened, it landed
[58:58.820 --> 59:07.260]  it was 30 seconds of silence. Yeah, absolutely. I felt like I had behind the scenes info and
[59:07.260 --> 59:11.080]  watching. It was nice. It was exciting. Watch great video. I'm excited to watch the pineapple.
[59:11.460 --> 59:16.180]  Oh, have you not seen it yet? Not yet. No. I saw you dropped it in, in the evening last night.
[59:16.260 --> 59:21.380]  I dropped it in. And there's a, for those who've seen it or were about to watch it,
[59:21.520 --> 59:24.680]  there are moments where people just start laughing at something that's happening off screen.
[59:24.680 --> 59:28.980]  And, uh, I assume that was me just bending over to try and fart. We get one in the video towards
[59:28.980 --> 59:34.000]  the end. Yes, that's exactly, that's exactly what that is. It is. It's very funny. It's,
[59:34.080 --> 59:37.420]  it happened a couple of times. It's very funny every time. Yeah. There's also a moment I left
[59:37.420 --> 59:42.480]  in that I don't think is clear. Uh, it was kind of just an in-joke, but Eric constantly bitches
[59:42.480 --> 59:45.900]  about Nick's ability to film the action and he's apparently always filming something else.
[59:46.260 --> 59:51.400]  So I spent a lot of that video just, just filming the complete opposite thing. And at one point,
[59:51.400 --> 59:55.040]  Eric's opening the fridge and saying, look at that. And I'm like filming the fridge door and
[59:55.040 --> 59:58.980]  I'm like filming all the other stuff in the fridge. And Eric gets mad. It's a real mess.
[59:58.980 --> 01:00:01.980]  But it's not clear that's what I'm doing. So that's, that was what I was doing in that moment.
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:06.080]  Yeah. You has to cover up his inability to be able to film and be like, it was actually a bit,
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:08.900]  what I was doing was like a funny bit. If you thought that it was filmed bad,
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:13.620]  it was actually funny. And you should like it. The bit where the fridge was a, was a bit,
[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:18.040]  a bit where I was actually filming the wrong thing while Jeff was eating. It was totally real.
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:21.220]  Oh man. You see, it's easy to do.
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:25.420]  My wife was so excited that call Barbara was one of the things on the wheel,
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:30.320]  like later. She's like, Oh my God, that's awesome. And all of the comments are,
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.460]  none of them are about my small wife. All of them are about, Oh my God,
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:38.780]  Bimmy Dunks coming into regulation. Morons!
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.660]  That's great. This is a good episode. This is a really good episode.
[01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:52.140]  Yeah. I would, I'd put this up there like eight. I feel good about like, yeah.
[01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:59.200]  I want to, if we do go and onion out the car, you onioned your car out with two meals, right?
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:02.860]  A hot dog and a hamburger meal. Yeah. And they both had onions.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:05.020]  Yeah. We can make it worse if we four it up.
[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:08.420]  So we could like quad, quad up the onion or double it from what you had.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.980]  We can absolutely do that. Yeah.
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:10.980]  Interesting.
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.560]  Yeah. Well, if it's not one for tomorrow, I think we should try that soon.
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:17.760]  If we can't do it tomorrow and I'm going to guess we can't let's do it next week.
[01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:19.720]  Let's just put it on the calendar sometime next week.
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:23.280]  We can, we can schedule it Monday and, uh, and make sure we do it.
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:26.880]  There you go.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.120]  Onion? Onion chant?
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:36.060]  All right. Well, that's a, that's probably a pretty good place to stop then.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.120]  It's real strong ending guys.
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:40.540]  Felt the fucking energy just drop.
[01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:41.740]  Punch.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.140]  That was like watch.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:45.680]  That was like watching Gavin after he's had CPAP all night,
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.480]  where it's just a fart that doesn't come.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.480]  It just never, well, geez, man.
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:51.600]  Are you still, so are you still CPAPing?
[01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:52.280]  Yeah.
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:56.120]  Are you, have you adjusted so you're not being filled with air like a balloon?
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:58.440]  Uh, well, I need to find the sweet spot still.
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:03.420]  Like I could turn it down, but then, uh, I just have apnea through the machine.
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:04.760]  Like it's not powerful enough.
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:10.020]  So I need to have it so it opens my nose, but not my throat.
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:10.860]  Okay.
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.000]  Okay.
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:18.060]  And sometimes if I get it, if it's like just too weak, my, my nose like blows open and
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:20.120]  close like a, like a door in the wind.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:28.800]  It's like, I'll be, I'll be dreaming about something.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:33.460]  And then suddenly I just hear like, and it's just my nose flap getting rattled.
[01:02:44.850 --> 01:02:45.970]  Nobody else has!
[01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:52.290]  I'm already, I'm already a massive disadvantage.
[01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:57.750]  Cause I, I, everything, everything in that industry comes in like small, medium, large.
[01:02:58.030 --> 01:03:00.110]  And it's obviously the large doesn't work.
[01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:04.810]  I need to go online and find the secret menu option of extra large for my nose.
[01:03:04.810 --> 01:03:08.710]  Otherwise nothing, nothing like my nose, nothing seals it.
[01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:11.550]  It's just this gaping nostrils that can't close around anything.
[01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:13.010]  It's a nightmare.
[01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:16.410]  I might be the worst CPAP user.
[01:03:17.810 --> 01:03:18.770]  Completely impossible.
[01:03:21.850 --> 01:03:23.570]  We could all have a go on it though.
[01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:27.690]  I'll buy everyone a fresh attachment.
[01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:31.950]  And see if it fills you with air.
[01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:37.110]  Maybe, maybe you should connect the CPAP to your ass and blow it out the other way.
[01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:39.890]  All day long.
[01:03:41.410 --> 01:03:45.850]  Uh, well, um, don't forget this Friday.
[01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:48.970]  It's GERPL times day at noon central time.
[01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:53.170]  We're going to be live on Twitch, twitch.tv slash the regulation pod, uh, just before
[01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:57.690]  noon to celebrate the release of the GERPLers, the Kuzlers, the two signs in the reprint of
[01:03:57.690 --> 01:03:58.030]  the shirt.
[01:03:58.470 --> 01:04:04.430]  And you can celebrate by going to regulation store.com or regulation store.store.
[01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:05.430]  Was that the other one?
[01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:09.350]  I'm still not convinced I ever had Jeff.sucks.
[01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:10.890]  That's insane.
[01:04:11.210 --> 01:04:12.050]  Oh, was it someone else?
[01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:13.370]  It had to have been.
[01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:14.110]  It was you!
[01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:15.630]  No, it happened in the meeting.
[01:04:15.830 --> 01:04:20.090]  This is, I'm so, I love, I love when Nick swoops in like this.
[01:04:20.410 --> 01:04:20.670]  It is.
[01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:22.410]  Nick piped in from the background.
[01:04:22.930 --> 01:04:25.190]  Not even verified info.
[01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:26.830]  Yeah, it happens a lot.
[01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:31.370]  It happens a lot in 100% Eat, where he'll just go, yeah, and then you don't know what
[01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:31.970]  he's talking about.
[01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:34.150]  He said it's mostly, he said it's mostly verified.
[01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:35.590]  What percent certain are you, Nick?
[01:04:36.130 --> 01:04:39.530]  I am, uh, 75% sure.
[01:04:39.570 --> 01:04:41.970]  Yeah, this number, this number went down.
[01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:42.850]  Oh, it did.
[01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:44.730]  It was at 90 when I started this.
[01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:52.270]  Also pretty wild that at the mind table, Nick was like as close as everyone else.
[01:04:52.330 --> 01:04:55.550]  Truly, Nick should be sat slightly further back from the mind table, Andrew.
[01:04:56.830 --> 01:04:58.350]  He's in an island of his own.
[01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:01.490]  He's the furthest away from the table from everybody else.
[01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:04.170]  He did say that because of the monkey mask.
[01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:08.650]  Yeah, but he was the same distance from Jeff as Jeff from the table.
[01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:10.370]  Well, in the way you drew it.
[01:05:10.650 --> 01:05:11.310]  Yeah, and you're drawing.
[01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:13.770]  No, it's not about the table.
[01:05:13.850 --> 01:05:15.770]  It's about where we are at the table.
[01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.510]  What?
[01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:20.170]  So, dude, we were wrapping up.
[01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:21.610]  We were wrapping up.
[01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:23.310]  We were about to put this episode to bed.
[01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:25.070]  It was going to be done like three minutes ago.
[01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:26.290]  I don't want to go anywhere.
[01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:28.990]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:31.030]  Can you just draw the correct mind table then?
[01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:32.890]  I'll put it together.
[01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:35.010]  But like, it's it's I mean, we were there.
[01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:35.950]  Sorry, man.
[01:05:36.050 --> 01:05:36.830]  We don't sorry.
[01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:38.790]  We don't want to tax you too hard.
[01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:43.090]  I really apologize for asking for clarification.
[01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:46.350]  Some people drew their own great ones.
[01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:48.390]  It was just yeah, there's so many good ones with headphones.
[01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:49.770]  And then just us floating around.
[01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:52.130]  I'm such I'm such a big fan of that one.
[01:05:52.210 --> 01:05:55.010]  I think this is so I think this is great.
[01:05:55.010 --> 01:05:56.250]  It's so funny.
[01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:59.250]  I think these mind tables are so good.
[01:05:59.370 --> 01:06:04.130]  Yeah, if Andrew could draw, draw the accurate mind table and as well, put in the corner that
[01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:04.810]  I'm backed into.
[01:06:05.010 --> 01:06:05.630]  He's going to draw.
[01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:08.450]  Well, everyone has to be sitting at the mind table.
[01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:11.050]  That's first of all, everyone has to be at the table.
[01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:14.390]  OK, so just give me a sec.
[01:06:15.610 --> 01:06:17.550]  OK, I'm making a drawable surface.
[01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.210]  No, no.
[01:06:18.330 --> 01:06:19.330]  Oh, my God.
[01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:19.750]  What does that mean?
[01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:27.270]  Well, he's he's turning he's turning some some papers of trash into paper, or he just
[01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:31.090]  took a screenshot or an image that he's drawing all over like a JPEG.
[01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:32.810]  Yeah, he's using a squinkles wrapper.
[01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:37.630]  Hey, no, he's it's it's a JPEG of like a receipt that he's drawing on the bottom of in like
[01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:37.970]  paint.
[01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:40.630]  Do a table.
[01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:41.830]  He's preparing that.
[01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:43.770]  Did everybody have their homework ready?
[01:06:44.410 --> 01:06:44.570]  Yeah.
[01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:46.270]  What?
[01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:47.210]  What?
[01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:50.070]  We had homework from the last episode.
[01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:51.210]  I have squinkles.
[01:06:51.830 --> 01:06:52.150]  Squinkles.
[01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:53.570]  Andrew mentioned it yesterday.
[01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:55.210]  And so I went and listened to the episode and he was right.
[01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.670]  We had homework.
[01:06:56.350 --> 01:06:57.450]  Oh, what was it?
[01:06:58.110 --> 01:06:58.830]  Well, I don't want to.
[01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:02.170]  I just wanted to see if everybody had it ready so we could dive into it after I want to
[01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:06.070]  I want to find out about this mind table first.
[01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:08.110]  Let me see if I've done my homework.
[01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:09.650]  What could be homework around here?
[01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:12.270]  I don't know.
[01:07:12.310 --> 01:07:14.470]  Look on your floor where all your important things are kept.
[01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.970]  I don't know.
[01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:23.030]  I was mostly just trying to create a layer of unease while we're waiting for Andrew to
[01:07:23.030 --> 01:07:24.030]  No, yeah, you did it.
[01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:24.650]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:25.750]  No, you nailed it, buddy.
[01:07:25.850 --> 01:07:26.830]  I really appreciate that.
[01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:27.250]  Thank you.
[01:07:27.530 --> 01:07:28.410]  Okay, I got it.
[01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:28.890]  Did it.
[01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:29.210]  Okay.
[01:07:29.490 --> 01:07:29.890]  Okay.
[01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:30.990]  I'm excited.
[01:07:31.310 --> 01:07:31.970]  Let's see it.
[01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:34.550]  Download photo.
[01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:37.010]  Save as J5th.
[01:07:42.050 --> 01:07:43.950]  Okay, here we go.
[01:07:44.030 --> 01:07:44.810]  Here's the table.
[01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:48.510]  Now we all have to be sitting at the table.
[01:07:49.050 --> 01:07:49.730]  You're an idiot.
[01:07:49.830 --> 01:07:52.490]  It does not say who's who.
[01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:52.730]  No.
[01:07:53.310 --> 01:07:54.310]  You're so stupid.
[01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:55.870]  You said it was a square.
[01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:57.590]  And then you said that Jeff's at the head.
[01:07:58.070 --> 01:07:59.970]  Firstly, how could Jeff be at the head of a square?
[01:08:00.210 --> 01:08:02.370]  And secondly, that's not a square, you idiot.
[01:08:02.810 --> 01:08:03.370]  Oh, one sec.
[01:08:03.530 --> 01:08:05.650]  Yeah, let me go back into the lab here.
[01:08:07.770 --> 01:08:08.670]  That's a good point.
[01:08:11.090 --> 01:08:12.370]  And what's that bit at the bottom?
[01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:13.570]  There's like a black line.
[01:08:13.570 --> 01:08:15.410]  That was the thing that I drew over.
[01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:16.830]  I missed a little part of it.
[01:08:19.610 --> 01:08:23.530]  You know, you can like go file new and you don't have to rub out what you've already
[01:08:23.530 --> 01:08:24.390]  drawn in paint.
[01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:29.530]  Okay, well, this table's a little wonky because I'm trying to speed through it.
[01:08:30.030 --> 01:08:31.930]  It's a tool for drawing a square.
[01:08:32.410 --> 01:08:32.870]  There we go.
[01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:33.650]  Okay, here we go.
[01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:36.210]  This is a speed draw version of it.
[01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:38.310]  Where did that photo come from?
[01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:40.790]  That's not... I don't even know what that was that just popped up on my screen.
[01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:41.950]  Here we go.
[01:08:42.090 --> 01:08:43.030]  Sounds like porn.
[01:08:43.570 --> 01:08:45.490]  No, it was like a bunch of drawings.
[01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:49.050]  Well, which I guess still could be porn, but it wasn't porn.
[01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:50.370]  Speed thing.
[01:08:50.490 --> 01:08:52.230]  So the square is not the best square.
[01:08:52.610 --> 01:08:54.390]  Is that the Windows 95 logo?
[01:08:59.730 --> 01:09:03.550]  Says you can clearly see Nick's at the top, the furthest away from all of us.
[01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:05.290]  But he's still at the table.
[01:09:05.830 --> 01:09:07.730]  You can clearly see that's Nick, Gavin.
[01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:08.830]  What don't you understand?
[01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:13.050]  This is you coming in being like, this is how it actually is.
[01:09:13.050 --> 01:09:15.190]  And it's so much worse than mine.
[01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:18.510]  You threw it at me at the last second of this recording.
[01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.830]  That's fine.
[01:09:19.230 --> 01:09:19.830]  I did do that.
[01:09:19.930 --> 01:09:20.950]  I did drop you in it.
[01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.910]  But that is a disgrace.
[01:09:22.530 --> 01:09:24.050]  Yeah, I'm not saying it's my best work.
[01:09:24.230 --> 01:09:25.130]  I never claimed that.
[01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:27.070]  Why is it different from your other drawing?
[01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:28.590]  Because he wanted a square.
[01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:31.390]  But the sides are different.
[01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:32.530]  Yeah, the sides are flipped.
[01:09:32.770 --> 01:09:34.250]  Also, why is it flipped now?
[01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:36.190]  Yeah, so who's at the top?
[01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:36.830]  Who's at the bottom?
[01:09:37.450 --> 01:09:38.370]  Bottom is Jeff.
[01:09:38.770 --> 01:09:39.730]  I thought it was the head.
[01:09:40.290 --> 01:09:41.310]  How can the head be the bottom?
[01:09:43.050 --> 01:09:44.350]  I thought I was at the table.
[01:09:44.410 --> 01:09:45.110]  Why am I so far?
[01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:48.090]  How do you determine what the top of the table is?
[01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:52.210]  Andrew, on the first drawing, there are two people on the left.
[01:09:52.450 --> 01:09:54.630]  On the second drawing, there are two people on the right.
[01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:57.630]  So what is the top to you?
[01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:02.230]  That's a good point, I guess.
[01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:03.090]  Yeah, I would...
[01:10:03.730 --> 01:10:04.150]  Yeah.
[01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:05.730]  You know what?
[01:10:06.010 --> 01:10:09.650]  To say my drawing was completely wrong based on his instructions,
[01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:11.550]  and then follow up with this is how it is,
[01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:14.770]  and then draw two completely different things is absolutely unbelievable.
[01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:16.410]  I was just thinking about...
[01:10:16.410 --> 01:10:18.470]  Because we're looking at it from a top-down angle.
[01:10:18.670 --> 01:10:21.710]  If I walk into your room, I don't know what the head of the table is.
[01:10:21.730 --> 01:10:22.830]  How do we know where the head is?
[01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:27.990]  You are the one telling us that someone is at the head.
[01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:28.950]  No, I'm just curious.
[01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:33.970]  I'm asking you in this picture, where is the head of the table?
[01:10:34.210 --> 01:10:34.670]  Where is Jeff sat?
[01:10:34.670 --> 01:10:35.450]  It's in your mind.
[01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:36.850]  You determine where the head is.
[01:10:36.930 --> 01:10:37.510]  You tell us.
[01:10:37.530 --> 01:10:38.010]  It's at the bottom.
[01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:39.030]  It's at the bottom.
[01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:41.230]  Okay, the head is the bottom in your mind.
[01:10:41.710 --> 01:10:42.110]  Yes.
[01:10:42.610 --> 01:10:44.290]  But that was just more of a general question,
[01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:46.790]  because when you say the head of the table, you think of the top,
[01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:47.950]  because the head is on the top.
[01:10:48.610 --> 01:10:50.390]  But how do you determine...
[01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:51.790]  The top, like the surface of the table.
[01:10:51.850 --> 01:10:56.570]  Who is you in the situation where you're explaining this to us?
[01:10:57.090 --> 01:10:59.430]  Is you us, or is you you?
[01:10:59.910 --> 01:11:02.370]  Thanks for listening to the Regulation Podcast.
[01:11:03.570 --> 01:11:04.250]  Like and subscribe.
[01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:06.190]  So many more questions than I had before.
[01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:10.430]  We were going to end like five minutes ago.
[01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:11.450]  We'll continue.
[01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:13.550]  This is absolutely crazy.
[01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:17.250]  We are going straight into mind table in episode 41.
[01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:18.610]  We are not done with this.
[01:11:18.810 --> 01:11:22.150]  I was hoping to have something that we could recreate in real life with a real square table.
[01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:24.650]  And I have like balloon people to represent it.
[01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:25.910]  I would have no idea.
[01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:30.290]  It's because you would put two people on one side and they would be on the wrong side.
[01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:31.270]  Maybe.
[01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:33.790]  They would have to be on both sides simultaneously, I guess.
[01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:34.110]  Yes.
[01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.590]  Yeah.
[01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:36.470]  Does anyone have an actual answer to that?
[01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:38.830]  How do you know where the head of the table is on a real table?
[01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:40.670]  It's the end.
[01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:43.010]  It's like a long rectangular table.
[01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:44.770]  There's the two ends in it.
[01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:46.250]  So there are two heads?
[01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:47.410]  Yes!
[01:11:47.530 --> 01:11:48.070]  That's stupid.
[01:11:49.730 --> 01:11:52.070]  Well, I would say maybe one head.
[01:11:52.810 --> 01:11:55.250]  Maybe the head is like opposite the door you came in.
[01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:56.130]  Oh, yeah.
[01:11:56.730 --> 01:11:57.010]  Okay.
[01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:58.790]  I was just curious if we knew.
[01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:59.730]  I didn't know that.
[01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:00.870]  Well, I don't know.
[01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:04.050]  I've always heard the expression like, oh, they're sitting at the head of the table.
[01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:08.810]  At a round or square table, the head seat is wherever the host wants to sit.
[01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:09.910]  According to Google.
[01:12:10.190 --> 01:12:11.010]  Oh, wow.
[01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:12.430]  This is like vintage.
[01:12:12.970 --> 01:12:13.530]  Jeff's the host.
[01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:19.170]  Wait, so Andrew is saying that you've just heard it as an expression, but you don't know what it is?
[01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:22.310]  I always assumed it was the person who was sitting at the end.
[01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:23.870]  I feel like in mob movies...
[01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:28.450]  Even if you think they were sitting at the end, how does a square have an end?
[01:12:28.670 --> 01:12:29.530]  And they're all ends!
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.760]  How does a square have an end?
[01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:38.120]  Well, there you go.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:41.640]  Another awesome episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:44.040]  This has been episode 40.
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:49.540]  I want to say this puts us somewhere around 250 episodes or something.
[01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:53.180]  My slider is at 9.4.
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:54.940]  I really felt it this episode.
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:59.360]  I felt the last probably 10 minutes of this really put it over the top for me.
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:00.240]  I'm really...
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:03.740]  I'll be honest, I took it down a little bit with that low energy ending that we were doing,
[01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:05.480]  and then it totally rebounded.
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:08.300]  Kudos to Andrew and his mind table.
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:11.140]  I cannot wait to sit at it again next week.
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:17.200]  With all of you, when we introduce to the world our gift to the universe,
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:19.440]  episode 41 of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:22.080]  It'll be in a post-Gerpeltine's world.
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:27.100]  I can only imagine that the sun shines a little bit brighter,
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.000]  the sky's a little bit bluer,
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:32.140]  the plants and the trees are a little bit greener,
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:35.120]  and the air is a little bit crisper in a post-Gerpeltine's world.
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:36.480]  I can't wait to see you there.
[01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:37.640]  Bye-bye, everybody!
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:38.400]  Love you, bye!
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:38.880]  Bye!
[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:39.380]  Bye!
