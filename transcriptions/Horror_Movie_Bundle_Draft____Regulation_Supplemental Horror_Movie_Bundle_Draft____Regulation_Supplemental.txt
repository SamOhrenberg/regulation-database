[00:28.830 --> 00:31.870]  Skinny Pop is a salty snack that keeps on giving.
[00:32.770 --> 00:37.270]  Made with just three simple ingredients for an irresistibly delicious taste
[00:37.270 --> 00:40.170]  and a large serving size that lasts.
[00:40.870 --> 00:43.390]  Deliciously popped. Perfectly salted.
[00:44.010 --> 00:46.170]  Skinny Pop. Popular for a reason.
[00:46.870 --> 00:48.050]  Shop Skinny Pop now.
[00:49.730 --> 00:53.890]  Hell yeah, we're here for more regulation supplemental.
[00:53.890 --> 01:01.550]  Well, Nick said, hell yeah, and we're going through.
[01:02.090 --> 01:03.270]  So we just did the movie league.
[01:03.470 --> 01:04.610]  Okay, that's what we did.
[01:05.190 --> 01:06.150]  And now it's Halloween.
[01:06.530 --> 01:07.910]  And I thought, what better time?
[01:07.970 --> 01:10.370]  We're going to re-bring that format back.
[01:10.470 --> 01:12.950]  That auction style with a little bit of a wrinkle.
[01:13.290 --> 01:13.750]  Re-bring.
[01:18.470 --> 01:19.390]  Re-bring?
[01:19.510 --> 01:20.130]  Re-bring.
[01:20.150 --> 01:23.110]  If you've bring something and then someone un-bring it,
[01:23.110 --> 01:24.050]  you can re-bring it.
[01:24.510 --> 01:26.270]  Did anybody un-bring this from you?
[01:26.470 --> 01:27.310]  Oh, I brought it.
[01:27.490 --> 01:29.070]  I un-brought this from him.
[01:29.170 --> 01:30.490]  Yeah, so he is re-bringing it.
[01:30.930 --> 01:31.310]  That's okay.
[01:31.410 --> 01:31.710]  That's true.
[01:33.450 --> 01:36.650]  This is an auction style draft.
[01:37.450 --> 01:39.790]  Now, but what we're doing is a little bit different.
[01:42.270 --> 01:43.590]  I'm just giving Jeff a moment.
[01:43.830 --> 01:44.510]  Get out of the system.
[01:46.030 --> 01:48.070]  We might have to re-bring Jeff into this one.
[01:48.950 --> 01:52.730]  What if bring it to is called re-bring it?
[01:53.110 --> 01:54.110]  That would be great, dude.
[01:54.310 --> 01:55.870]  It should have been called re-bring it.
[01:56.450 --> 01:57.570]  Re-bring it on again.
[01:58.030 --> 01:58.290]  Yeah.
[02:03.630 --> 02:07.470]  So we have our list of films on the left.
[02:09.390 --> 02:10.710]  You still need time, Jeff?
[02:11.010 --> 02:11.250]  Still?
[02:11.430 --> 02:13.110]  No, I'm just laughing at Nick laughing at me.
[02:13.730 --> 02:15.910]  Well, he was laughing at you laughing.
[02:16.150 --> 02:17.830]  I know, it's become a vicious cycle.
[02:18.410 --> 02:20.370]  I'm laughing because of the peanut butter still.
[02:20.590 --> 02:21.030]  That's...
[02:23.610 --> 02:24.830]  There's no peanut butter in this draft.
[02:25.150 --> 02:27.950]  We have a list of movies on the left.
[02:28.070 --> 02:28.910]  They're horror movies.
[02:29.230 --> 02:30.590]  If we want, we can add to them.
[02:30.650 --> 02:33.570]  There's 100 I pulled from the IGN list of top 100.
[02:34.010 --> 02:37.090]  Then I sprinkled in some at the bottom that I thought would be good.
[02:37.590 --> 02:38.770]  If we want to add more, we can.
[02:39.110 --> 02:41.750]  How this game is going to work is we are making...
[02:41.750 --> 02:43.710]  You know how like when you go to the store, you get a DVD,
[02:43.890 --> 02:45.690]  like four pack, five pack type thing?
[02:46.270 --> 02:51.850]  We are each as a movie studio making our own five pack.
[02:51.850 --> 02:55.110]  So the people listening to this, when we're done,
[02:55.510 --> 02:58.950]  you can decide which one you would want the most.
[02:59.050 --> 03:00.550]  And that is how we will determine a winner.
[03:01.250 --> 03:06.910]  We all have 98 points to acquire our potential five films.
[03:07.230 --> 03:10.050]  And how this will work, what makes it a little bit different,
[03:10.690 --> 03:13.050]  is let's say I'm first to go.
[03:13.550 --> 03:17.050]  I will put a movie up for nomination for bidding.
[03:17.530 --> 03:21.530]  And then I do not have to bid on it if I don't want to.
[03:21.530 --> 03:23.090]  I am just nominating it.
[03:23.250 --> 03:26.330]  If nobody bids on it, then it's just deleted from the sheet.
[03:26.690 --> 03:27.770]  We get rid of it.
[03:27.810 --> 03:28.230]  Jesus.
[03:29.350 --> 03:29.430]  Wow.
[03:30.650 --> 03:32.870]  Why would you nominate something you're not interested in, though?
[03:33.070 --> 03:37.330]  Let's say if there's a movie I think will go high in demand that I don't want,
[03:37.450 --> 03:40.370]  I can knock down other people's point totals potentially.
[03:40.370 --> 03:41.290]  So you're just causing a spend.
[03:41.710 --> 03:43.070]  I'm just causing a spend.
[03:43.290 --> 03:44.830]  Yeah, or maybe I just want it.
[03:45.350 --> 03:45.770]  So...
[03:45.770 --> 03:49.750]  And we're only going to have one, two, three, four, five total each?
[03:49.750 --> 03:51.590]  You can have a maximum of five.
[03:52.230 --> 03:52.590]  Wow.
[03:53.110 --> 03:54.330]  But you could go under that.
[03:54.930 --> 03:57.850]  Oh, if you blow up all your points without five films, yeah.
[03:59.130 --> 03:59.490]  Interesting.
[04:00.690 --> 04:01.410]  Very interesting.
[04:02.190 --> 04:02.410]  Okay.
[04:02.410 --> 04:03.110]  I'm ready to go.
[04:03.230 --> 04:04.970]  If you got or do you guys want to look at the sheet?
[04:05.030 --> 04:08.230]  Is there any movies on this list that you would like to add?
[04:08.410 --> 04:09.590]  Now, here's the thing.
[04:09.710 --> 04:12.170]  Any movies on the list that I would like to add?
[04:12.510 --> 04:13.590]  Like re-add?
[04:13.770 --> 04:15.810]  Do I want to re-bring them to the list?
[04:18.370 --> 04:19.530]  Rosemary's Baby is on here.
[04:19.530 --> 04:21.030]  I'd like to re-bring it on here.
[04:21.490 --> 04:21.930]  Okay.
[04:24.030 --> 04:26.250]  I, Andrew, I think this is a great list.
[04:26.430 --> 04:27.570]  I think it is comprehensive.
[04:27.930 --> 04:30.310]  I think you did a good job adding some of your own and everything.
[04:30.630 --> 04:34.050]  I want everyone to have the expectation of what we're about to run into,
[04:34.170 --> 04:40.310]  which is horror movie fans who are terrible, miserable people
[04:40.310 --> 04:43.050]  who are going to be upset about...
[04:43.050 --> 04:43.770]  I stand by that.
[04:44.010 --> 04:47.790]  Who are going to be upset about a movie that didn't make this cut
[04:47.790 --> 04:49.790]  because they watched it on Shudder one time
[04:49.790 --> 04:52.570]  and they're like, actually, that's better than The Exorcist.
[04:52.730 --> 04:54.490]  And that's what we're about to run into.
[04:54.710 --> 04:56.830]  I think your list is fantastic, personally.
[04:56.990 --> 05:00.170]  Are we trying to have the list of best movies
[05:00.170 --> 05:01.830]  or just the scariest movies?
[05:01.970 --> 05:03.690]  Like, what are we judging the final five on?
[05:03.710 --> 05:07.070]  As your studio, you get to define what that list is for you.
[05:07.990 --> 05:08.770]  You pick.
[05:08.990 --> 05:12.870]  Maybe you want to go with horror movies that you think are fun.
[05:13.190 --> 05:15.050]  Maybe you want things you think are really spooky.
[05:15.430 --> 05:16.630]  That is for you to decide.
[05:16.630 --> 05:19.310]  When do we submit our studio names?
[05:19.730 --> 05:21.150]  I think we should go through that right now
[05:21.150 --> 05:24.630]  because we have the order in which we are...
[05:24.630 --> 05:26.030]  Well, order is tough.
[05:26.110 --> 05:29.050]  It's the way we're listed here, which is our standings.
[05:29.170 --> 05:31.590]  And I think that's the way our movie studios should be presented.
[05:31.950 --> 05:38.530]  Andrew, you are at this current time winning the summer movie auction.
[05:39.490 --> 05:41.390]  So why don't you give us your studio name?
[05:41.750 --> 05:45.290]  I'm going to clear my name out of the top here so I can put it in.
[05:45.930 --> 05:51.370]  As the first place team, excited to unveil, you know, as a billion dollar unnamed studio.
[05:51.590 --> 05:52.610]  Wild decision.
[05:53.350 --> 05:59.510]  I'm excited to reveal my official studio name, which is A24 is my name.
[06:00.210 --> 06:01.210]  Uniquely original.
[06:02.190 --> 06:03.630]  A little bit of a twist.
[06:04.870 --> 06:06.170]  What's the 24 stand for?
[06:06.910 --> 06:11.550]  You know, 24 hours because we bring entertainment around the clock.
[06:11.670 --> 06:12.390]  Oh, wow.
[06:13.550 --> 06:15.270]  That's what it stands for.
[06:15.970 --> 06:21.930]  Yep, A24 is my studio name.
[06:22.690 --> 06:24.750]  Gavin, what is your studio name?
[06:24.790 --> 06:25.850]  A second place.
[06:26.450 --> 06:27.090]  Thanks for asking.
[06:27.190 --> 06:30.610]  My studio name is Lights Camera Clunge.
[06:33.510 --> 06:36.230]  I know what I would expect from that studio.
[06:36.750 --> 06:38.170]  C-L-U-N-G-E, I believe.
[06:38.830 --> 06:40.070]  Is there an E at the end or?
[06:40.370 --> 06:40.690]  Yes.
[06:40.930 --> 06:41.210]  Okay.
[06:41.370 --> 06:42.570]  So it's like plunge.
[06:42.770 --> 06:43.470]  Plungue, yeah.
[06:43.470 --> 06:44.010]  Right.
[06:44.270 --> 06:46.070]  But let's get the commas though.
[06:46.230 --> 06:47.970]  It's lights, comma, you know, camera.
[06:48.190 --> 06:48.850]  Oh, oh, there's.
[06:48.970 --> 06:49.650]  Okay, sorry.
[06:50.810 --> 06:53.390]  Lights, camera, clunge.
[06:53.950 --> 06:54.250]  Okay.
[06:54.450 --> 06:56.430]  Oh, now here's the thing.
[06:56.730 --> 07:00.670]  You said A24 and I think we all assumed it was the letter.
[07:01.290 --> 07:03.010]  Nope, A24.
[07:04.150 --> 07:05.310]  I don't want to get sued.
[07:05.570 --> 07:05.770]  Jesus.
[07:06.490 --> 07:07.010]  Oh.
[07:07.370 --> 07:09.730]  Oh, Canada, got it.
[07:10.250 --> 07:10.770]  Yeah.
[07:13.590 --> 07:16.050]  Jeff, Jeff hates it.
[07:16.190 --> 07:17.490]  This rocks.
[07:17.670 --> 07:19.590]  I'm going to just write my own in because you guys are.
[07:19.790 --> 07:19.950]  Oh, please.
[07:20.170 --> 07:21.150]  Yeah, absolutely.
[07:21.790 --> 07:25.470]  My studio, my billion dollar studio is titled.
[07:26.450 --> 07:28.310]  Well, you're not a billion dollar studio, but continue.
[07:28.570 --> 07:31.230]  It can hear you.
[07:32.250 --> 07:32.730]  Okay.
[07:33.290 --> 07:33.770]  Studios.
[07:34.650 --> 07:35.130]  Okay.
[07:35.510 --> 07:36.050]  So how did.
[07:36.790 --> 07:38.090]  It can hear you.
[07:38.110 --> 07:39.030]  What a name.
[07:39.550 --> 07:40.030]  Oh, good job.
[07:40.290 --> 07:40.450]  Okay.
[07:40.830 --> 07:41.550]  That's pretty good.
[07:42.190 --> 07:43.570]  Can I change my studio name?
[07:43.710 --> 07:44.410]  No, too late.
[07:44.570 --> 07:45.450]  You're already locked in.
[07:46.590 --> 07:49.970]  Nick, you are in fourth in the Summer Movie Draft League.
[07:51.070 --> 07:56.050]  Well, yeah, this production is brought to you by Sauce Boss Studios.
[07:56.230 --> 07:57.390]  Sauce Boss Studios.
[07:58.110 --> 07:58.610]  Pretty good.
[07:58.910 --> 07:59.670]  Spooky name.
[08:00.110 --> 08:00.270]  Yeah.
[08:02.250 --> 08:04.430]  Are you writing it in or am I doing it?
[08:05.070 --> 08:06.210]  I'm not in it.
[08:08.730 --> 08:09.630]  Who's the walrus?
[08:09.890 --> 08:11.350]  Somebody else is just over it.
[08:11.350 --> 08:11.810]  That's cool.
[08:15.310 --> 08:16.670]  My name.
[08:17.150 --> 08:18.050]  Now, here's the thing.
[08:18.270 --> 08:21.670]  Everyone seems like they have it all locked down and everything.
[08:22.090 --> 08:26.170]  However, I am in last in the Summer Movie Draft.
[08:26.590 --> 08:31.750]  And so I had to take outside funding in order to even participate in this.
[08:32.130 --> 08:40.750]  My studio, what I wanted to call it, was absolute best film studio winner.
[08:41.350 --> 08:49.230]  However, because I could not afford to be participating in this, the name of my studio
[08:50.050 --> 08:58.250]  is, uh, Zhuaidun, Zhuai, Zhai, Dianying, Zhi, Pian, Cheng, Desu.
[08:59.530 --> 09:00.190]  So...
[09:00.190 --> 09:01.570]  Yeah, so that is...
[09:01.570 --> 09:05.270]  I'm glad to be here and I'm excited for the Summer Movie Draft League.
[09:08.730 --> 09:09.310]  What?
[09:09.750 --> 09:10.150]  Okay.
[09:11.350 --> 09:11.990]  Oh, man.
[09:12.250 --> 09:12.630]  Okay.
[09:12.830 --> 09:13.610]  Are we ready?
[09:13.870 --> 09:15.170]  Does anyone have questions?
[09:16.030 --> 09:16.250]  No.
[09:16.810 --> 09:17.090]  Proceed.
[09:17.750 --> 09:18.230]  Okay.
[09:19.130 --> 09:19.970]  I'm gonna put up a movie.
[09:20.250 --> 09:22.090]  Do you ever think that we're just getting out of hand?
[09:22.590 --> 09:23.070]  Yes.
[09:24.030 --> 09:24.910]  Yeah, pretty much.
[09:24.950 --> 09:25.350]  Which one?
[09:25.430 --> 09:26.170]  Was that the question?
[09:26.310 --> 09:26.650]  Yes.
[09:27.270 --> 09:27.550]  Who?
[09:28.090 --> 09:28.370]  What?
[09:30.130 --> 09:35.390]  Ah, he's gonna be the winner today.
[09:35.910 --> 09:41.270]  It was a sigh from Nick because he'd have to include Craig to have what you just did in it.
[09:41.350 --> 09:42.410]  You just...
[09:42.410 --> 09:44.050]  He doesn't show up in Craig.
[09:44.290 --> 09:45.530]  I have to do it from the original.
[09:45.530 --> 09:46.530]  Oh, Nick.
[09:46.690 --> 09:47.250]  I'm sorry.
[09:47.490 --> 09:49.210]  Well, we were all quiet when it happened.
[09:49.430 --> 09:50.450]  Do you want it one more time here?
[09:53.370 --> 09:54.330]  There you go.
[09:54.350 --> 09:54.750]  Thanks, guys.
[09:54.890 --> 09:55.830]  Thanks for getting that clean.
[10:03.130 --> 10:03.930]  I'm gonna...
[10:04.670 --> 10:06.290]  I'm gonna nominate the first film.
[10:06.810 --> 10:07.030]  Okay.
[10:07.070 --> 10:08.690]  And I'm starting off with a banger.
[10:10.070 --> 10:11.150]  I'm going Anaconda.
[10:11.350 --> 10:13.310]  Put Anaconda first up for board.
[10:13.970 --> 10:14.710]  One point.
[10:16.310 --> 10:16.710]  Cheers.
[10:17.490 --> 10:18.350]  Yeah, it's all yours, buddy.
[10:18.770 --> 10:19.190]  Got it.
[10:19.310 --> 10:19.610]  Enjoy.
[10:20.190 --> 10:21.250]  Nobody else...
[10:21.250 --> 10:22.610]  Nobody else wants to bid on Anaconda?
[10:23.190 --> 10:23.590]  Not particularly.
[10:24.030 --> 10:24.530]  There you go, man.
[10:25.310 --> 10:26.830]  Okay, I'll take that.
[10:27.010 --> 10:29.110]  One point for Anaconda?
[10:29.430 --> 10:30.110]  Are you kidding me?
[10:30.270 --> 10:32.250]  And now you have four movies left.
[10:33.010 --> 10:33.290]  Yeah.
[10:34.030 --> 10:34.610]  It's def...
[10:34.610 --> 10:39.510]  To me, this is definitely less of a points-based thing and more of a...
[10:39.510 --> 10:42.350]  I only have five things in my roster.
[10:42.710 --> 10:43.570]  Go ahead, Gavin.
[10:44.330 --> 10:45.190]  You nominate a film.
[10:46.170 --> 10:46.650]  Ooh.
[10:49.510 --> 10:52.510]  I will do Blair Witch.
[10:53.050 --> 10:53.950]  Ooh, Blair Witch?
[10:56.390 --> 10:57.870]  I have no interest.
[10:58.270 --> 10:59.310]  I'll do five points.
[11:00.690 --> 11:01.830]  Five points, is that it?
[11:02.230 --> 11:02.650]  Give it to me.
[11:02.670 --> 11:04.070]  Does anyone else want to bid on Blair Witch?
[11:04.370 --> 11:05.110]  Give it to me.
[11:06.550 --> 11:07.230]  Blair Witch Project.
[11:07.350 --> 11:07.950]  What number is Blair Witch?
[11:09.850 --> 11:10.370]  Seventy...
[11:10.370 --> 11:10.870]  How cool?
[11:11.090 --> 11:11.570]  Seventy-eight.
[11:11.710 --> 11:12.050]  Got it.
[11:12.670 --> 11:15.450]  How? What? Did you guess?
[11:17.350 --> 11:19.150]  I'd already scrolled away and I just couldn't remember.
[11:19.610 --> 11:20.450]  It was around there.
[11:23.090 --> 11:24.130]  Everything is...
[11:24.130 --> 11:25.070]  Everything is a number.
[11:30.820 --> 11:32.260]  Oh my god.
[11:32.380 --> 11:32.740]  Geoff!
[11:33.080 --> 11:34.420]  Geoff, what's your pick?
[11:34.560 --> 11:34.880]  Geoff?
[11:35.340 --> 11:36.600]  Okay, it's my pick.
[11:37.060 --> 11:39.000]  I now need to pick a movie.
[11:39.420 --> 11:39.780]  Yep.
[11:40.020 --> 11:43.600]  The movie that I'm going to pick is The Thing.
[11:43.720 --> 11:44.840]  John Carpenter's The Thing.
[11:44.980 --> 11:45.580]  Is that on here?
[11:46.280 --> 11:46.760]  Yeah, it is.
[11:47.200 --> 11:47.780]  Oh shit.
[11:48.040 --> 11:49.800]  Wait, wait, wait.
[11:50.360 --> 11:51.160]  Wait, is it the remake?
[11:51.660 --> 11:52.280]  Time out.
[11:52.920 --> 11:55.040]  Oh, is it because we changed the names up here?
[11:55.060 --> 11:56.520]  Yeah, we swapped.
[11:59.160 --> 12:00.580]  Okay, what's the next nomination?
[12:00.820 --> 12:00.980]  Sorry.
[12:02.640 --> 12:03.440]  It was...
[12:04.200 --> 12:05.420]  What did I say? The Exorcist?
[12:05.600 --> 12:05.920]  The Thing.
[12:06.040 --> 12:06.800]  No, The Thing.
[12:06.940 --> 12:07.640]  John Carpenter's The Thing.
[12:08.020 --> 12:08.420]  Seven.
[12:11.260 --> 12:13.300]  Wait, what did you say? You said seven?
[12:14.040 --> 12:14.460]  Ten.
[12:16.880 --> 12:17.540]  Twenty.
[12:18.160 --> 12:20.780]  Whoa! Twenty from Gavin?
[12:21.300 --> 12:21.920]  Twenty-one!
[12:22.340 --> 12:23.100]  Twenty-one from Nick.
[12:23.720 --> 12:25.100]  Twenty-five from Geoff.
[12:25.960 --> 12:26.980]  Twenty-six.
[12:27.540 --> 12:27.960]  Twenty-seven.
[12:28.660 --> 12:28.840]  Okay.
[12:29.440 --> 12:30.100]  Thirty.
[12:31.060 --> 12:31.720]  Fuck.
[12:34.000 --> 12:35.320]  Thirty... one.
[12:35.700 --> 12:36.360]  Wow.
[12:36.660 --> 12:37.000]  Thirty-two.
[12:37.520 --> 12:37.880]  Thirty-two.
[12:38.410 --> 12:38.980]  Oh!
[12:41.670 --> 12:42.760]  Thirty-three.
[12:43.500 --> 12:45.700]  Thirty-four.
[12:46.560 --> 12:48.580]  Oh, balls.
[12:48.980 --> 12:49.220]  Forty.
[12:49.560 --> 12:50.160]  Oh, fuck.
[12:50.240 --> 12:50.880]  Whoa!
[12:52.030 --> 12:52.800]  Forty-one?
[12:53.740 --> 12:55.200]  Jesus, Nick.
[12:56.420 --> 12:57.240]  Forty-two.
[12:58.000 --> 12:58.480]  Wow.
[12:59.920 --> 13:00.820]  Forty-five.
[13:01.420 --> 13:02.660]  Oh, man.
[13:06.930 --> 13:07.860]  Forty-six.
[13:09.220 --> 13:09.660]  Urgh.
[13:16.380 --> 13:18.480]  It's one of my favorite movies of all time.
[13:18.560 --> 13:19.500]  I think I have to.
[13:20.100 --> 13:21.340]  Best. It's the best horror movie.
[13:22.500 --> 13:22.940]  Fuck.
[13:24.260 --> 13:25.140]  Might be too rich.
[13:25.200 --> 13:25.820]  Oh, man.
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.040]  But also, like, I'm looking in the context of my DVD pack.
[13:29.300 --> 13:32.380]  Anaconda and The Thing in the same pack is fucking crazy.
[13:32.640 --> 13:33.180]  That isn't it?
[13:33.700 --> 13:34.980]  That makes no sense, totally.
[13:35.380 --> 13:36.120]  Fifty-one.
[13:37.160 --> 13:37.600]  Wow.
[13:40.430 --> 13:41.030]  Fifty-two.
[13:41.090 --> 13:41.990]  Going once.
[13:42.970 --> 13:43.770]  Oh, jeez.
[13:49.510 --> 13:51.070]  How does it get good?
[13:51.130 --> 13:53.070]  Every time we start doing this, it's like,
[13:53.150 --> 13:54.090]  I don't really know about this.
[13:54.250 --> 13:56.350]  This happens, and I'm like, this is the best thing we've ever done.
[13:56.550 --> 13:57.310]  This fucking rocks.
[13:57.330 --> 13:58.090]  Fifty-three.
[13:58.510 --> 13:59.650]  Oh, my God!
[14:02.590 --> 14:03.950]  I'm having a good time.
[14:04.150 --> 14:05.150]  Having a good time.
[14:05.270 --> 14:05.790]  Fifty-five.
[14:06.490 --> 14:08.250]  Fifty-five to Gavin!
[14:08.970 --> 14:09.570]  Wow!
[14:10.030 --> 14:11.930]  I mean, it's the best movie on here.
[14:12.950 --> 14:13.270]  Yeah.
[14:13.470 --> 14:14.130]  Fifty-eight.
[14:14.950 --> 14:16.750]  Oh, my God.
[14:17.370 --> 14:18.050]  Jeez.
[14:19.410 --> 14:20.750]  Having despicable me flashbacks.
[14:24.110 --> 14:25.510]  Fifty-eight going once.
[14:25.630 --> 14:26.070]  Fifty-eight going once.
[14:26.990 --> 14:28.690]  Going twice.
[14:30.590 --> 14:31.710]  Fifty-eight.
[14:32.590 --> 14:33.710]  It's sold.
[14:34.730 --> 14:35.750]  Give me the thing.
[14:36.090 --> 14:36.350]  Dude.
[14:37.010 --> 14:37.230]  Dude.
[14:39.650 --> 14:40.990]  I'm going to be out of this thing.
[14:41.450 --> 14:42.290]  Yeah, no kidding.
[14:42.570 --> 14:43.710]  I'm going to be out of this draft quickly.
[14:44.190 --> 14:44.390]  Yep.
[14:44.690 --> 14:47.190]  You better enjoy Anaconda and the thing,
[14:47.290 --> 14:50.410]  and then probably like Cat People and Carnival of Souls for two points each.
[14:51.410 --> 14:53.590]  Cat People is such a dog shit movie.
[14:54.590 --> 14:55.350]  Oh, my God.
[14:55.350 --> 14:56.770]  My mom liked that when I was a kid.
[14:56.910 --> 14:58.130]  It sucks so bad.
[14:58.390 --> 14:59.070]  Oh, man.
[14:59.330 --> 15:00.810]  Okay, who's next to nominate on the board?
[15:02.050 --> 15:03.870]  Nick, what are you thinking?
[15:04.150 --> 15:04.390]  Oh, boy.
[15:04.790 --> 15:05.570]  Holly, you're up.
[15:06.790 --> 15:07.170]  What?
[15:07.310 --> 15:08.650]  You're the sauce boss.
[15:10.210 --> 15:11.390]  Oh, let's see.
[15:11.510 --> 15:12.190]  How about...
[15:12.190 --> 15:12.670]  I got it, Gavin.
[15:13.270 --> 15:13.790]  Thanks, Geoff.
[15:13.810 --> 15:14.830]  How about number 77?
[15:14.950 --> 15:16.030]  The Cabin in the Woods.
[15:16.590 --> 15:17.390]  Cabin in the Woods.
[15:18.130 --> 15:18.510]  Three.
[15:21.190 --> 15:24.290]  Does have the Charger and Jockey in it from Left 4 Dead 2.
[15:26.050 --> 15:27.350]  So does World War Z.
[15:29.370 --> 15:31.490]  I don't think I want it.
[15:33.350 --> 15:33.770]  Anyone else?
[15:33.910 --> 15:35.090]  For three points, this rocks.
[15:35.310 --> 15:35.750]  This is awesome.
[15:35.770 --> 15:36.330]  Yeah, go for it, man.
[15:36.330 --> 15:37.210]  Dude!
[15:38.230 --> 15:38.670]  There you go.
[15:38.970 --> 15:40.730]  Dude, here's the thing.
[15:41.170 --> 15:46.650]  I'm really zeroing in on people that read Fangoria Magazine still and have jobs at the mall.
[15:47.130 --> 15:47.570]  This is...
[15:47.570 --> 15:48.710]  I'm going to make...
[15:48.710 --> 15:49.610]  Oh, man, this rocks.
[15:49.950 --> 15:50.510]  This is going to be so cool.
[15:50.510 --> 15:53.670]  Eric has two Woods-based movies in his, so far.
[15:53.890 --> 15:55.770]  And they're also next to each other, which is great.
[15:55.910 --> 15:56.850]  But it was three?
[15:57.070 --> 15:57.630]  Was that your bid?
[15:58.010 --> 15:58.530]  Yeah, three.
[16:01.510 --> 16:04.390]  I was hoping that would debate, cause a debate.
[16:04.990 --> 16:05.430]  Next!
[16:08.310 --> 16:12.070]  Next, I'm going to pick, on this list, number 72.
[16:12.730 --> 16:15.650]  A more intellectual horror movie.
[16:15.970 --> 16:16.670]  Jacob's Ladder.
[16:17.310 --> 16:18.110]  And I'll start it at one.
[16:18.630 --> 16:19.430]  I'll start it at one.
[16:20.070 --> 16:20.710]  Seen that.
[16:21.750 --> 16:22.450]  Never seen it.
[16:22.530 --> 16:22.930]  Tim Robbins.
[16:24.150 --> 16:24.950]  It is...
[16:24.950 --> 16:25.490]  Fuck.
[16:25.910 --> 16:28.110]  I don't want it, but I don't want you to get it for so cheap.
[16:28.190 --> 16:29.290]  So I'll bid...
[16:30.150 --> 16:30.690]  I'll bid.
[16:32.810 --> 16:33.610]  Careful, Jeff.
[16:33.950 --> 16:34.490]  I don't want it.
[16:34.730 --> 16:35.470]  It's a good movie, though.
[16:36.330 --> 16:37.910]  Am I getting Jacob's Ladder for one?
[16:38.130 --> 16:38.670]  This rocks.
[16:38.810 --> 16:39.030]  Two.
[16:39.170 --> 16:40.030]  Oh, two!
[16:40.150 --> 16:40.690]  Jeff got...
[16:40.690 --> 16:41.890]  Okay, two to Gavin.
[16:42.130 --> 16:42.510]  Three.
[16:42.950 --> 16:45.530]  Oh, you going above three, Gavin?
[16:46.290 --> 16:46.730]  Four.
[16:48.470 --> 16:48.910]  Five.
[16:48.970 --> 16:49.410]  This is a real good film.
[16:50.810 --> 16:51.350]  It's got a little...
[16:51.350 --> 16:51.730]  What is her name?
[16:51.790 --> 16:52.470]  Elizabeth Pena?
[16:54.270 --> 16:54.710]  Six.
[16:54.710 --> 16:55.290]  I've never seen it.
[16:55.510 --> 16:56.570]  I don't really know what I'm bidding for.
[16:57.010 --> 16:58.130]  Nick was six.
[16:58.930 --> 16:59.630]  We got a seven?
[17:00.330 --> 17:00.970]  I'll go seven.
[17:02.890 --> 17:03.770]  Eric was seven.
[17:04.670 --> 17:05.150]  That'll do.
[17:05.150 --> 17:06.810]  Nick doesn't want it.
[17:07.250 --> 17:08.250]  Seven going once.
[17:08.510 --> 17:09.410]  I'll make Eric pay more for it.
[17:10.150 --> 17:11.050]  Seven go twice.
[17:12.270 --> 17:13.630]  Seven sold to Eric.
[17:13.630 --> 17:14.030]  I love it.
[17:14.130 --> 17:14.670]  Jacob's Ladder.
[17:15.170 --> 17:18.150]  I have almost made my whole DVD compilation.
[17:18.550 --> 17:19.990]  I still have 83 points.
[17:20.250 --> 17:22.130]  Yeah, you're just walking around with one big stick for your fist.
[17:22.130 --> 17:26.350]  Andrew has Anaconda and The Thing, 39 left.
[17:26.710 --> 17:28.390]  Like, this is great.
[17:28.750 --> 17:30.490]  I'm feeling so good about this list.
[17:30.890 --> 17:31.550]  This is...
[17:31.550 --> 17:32.710]  Honestly, here's the thing.
[17:35.610 --> 17:37.990]  Is ready to win this whole thing.
[17:38.050 --> 17:38.930]  This is so great.
[17:39.270 --> 17:43.210]  So I'm back up for nomination?
[17:43.610 --> 17:44.230]  You are!
[17:44.830 --> 17:45.590]  Oh, man.
[17:46.670 --> 17:48.030]  Uh, what do I want to pick?
[17:48.290 --> 17:50.330]  I'm just curious what will happen if I do this.
[17:50.670 --> 17:52.310]  Twin Peaks Firewalk with me.
[17:52.670 --> 17:53.470]  Oh, wow.
[17:54.130 --> 17:54.610]  Oh.
[17:57.690 --> 17:59.770]  I have no interest in bidding on it.
[17:59.890 --> 18:00.610]  I've never seen it.
[18:01.530 --> 18:03.090]  It's a phenomenal film.
[18:03.090 --> 18:05.290]  So now there's some Twin Peaks fans in here.
[18:05.350 --> 18:06.370]  Yeah, it's a phenomenal film.
[18:06.430 --> 18:09.490]  Doesn't fit into what I'm trying to do with my studio, but it is an amazing film.
[18:09.610 --> 18:09.890]  Yeah, same here.
[18:10.090 --> 18:10.790]  Got Bowie in it.
[18:11.090 --> 18:12.250]  Now, here's the thing, Jeff.
[18:12.310 --> 18:14.510]  So far, you've done nothing with your studio.
[18:16.210 --> 18:17.810]  He's waiting for the right movies to come along.
[18:19.130 --> 18:21.810]  I got outbid on my initial film that I wanted.
[18:21.910 --> 18:24.250]  I didn't want to pay what y'all wanted to pay for it, so I pivoted.
[18:25.130 --> 18:27.350]  Twin Peaks Firewalk with me going away twice.
[18:29.610 --> 18:31.870]  Twin Peaks Firewalk with me is dead.
[18:32.950 --> 18:33.990]  Just strike it out.
[18:34.310 --> 18:34.930]  Get it out of here.
[18:35.530 --> 18:36.030]  Just gone.
[18:37.390 --> 18:37.710]  Okay.
[18:38.410 --> 18:39.210]  No one else can nominate.
[18:39.510 --> 18:40.590]  Whoa, did you just delete it?
[18:41.270 --> 18:41.590]  Yeah.
[18:42.330 --> 18:42.650]  Whoa.
[18:43.190 --> 18:45.270]  I mean, I was just gonna strike it.
[18:45.290 --> 18:47.430]  I was gonna just strike it through, but...
[18:47.430 --> 18:49.430]  Oh, you said get it out of here.
[18:49.530 --> 18:49.730]  Get rid of it.
[18:49.730 --> 18:51.310]  No, I mean, like, bring it back.
[18:53.230 --> 18:54.190]  I'm not gonna re-bring it.
[18:54.190 --> 18:54.870]  Re-bring it!
[18:55.250 --> 18:56.270]  I need you to re-bring it.
[18:57.110 --> 18:57.930]  Please re-bring it.
[18:58.850 --> 18:59.170]  Twin...
[19:02.650 --> 19:03.090]  Peaks.
[19:03.410 --> 19:07.430]  Are you typing it back instead of undoing it?
[19:07.570 --> 19:08.570]  Why didn't you just undo?
[19:08.930 --> 19:09.630]  I can undo.
[19:10.550 --> 19:11.770]  At this point, no.
[19:11.950 --> 19:13.110]  You can just keep typing.
[19:14.110 --> 19:14.970]  Oh, wait, wait.
[19:15.230 --> 19:16.730]  Undo that, and then undo...
[19:16.730 --> 19:17.150]  There we go.
[19:17.330 --> 19:17.910]  There we go.
[19:20.110 --> 19:20.910]  There you go.
[19:21.190 --> 19:24.110]  That way it's still there, and we know what we've eliminated.
[19:24.450 --> 19:25.630]  And that way we don't go...
[19:25.630 --> 19:26.990]  You didn't say get it out of there.
[19:28.570 --> 19:29.570]  Doesn't matter, though.
[19:29.890 --> 19:31.190]  Gavin, you're up.
[19:31.330 --> 19:31.450]  Go for it.
[19:31.450 --> 19:32.990]  Nominate yours.
[19:33.530 --> 19:34.610]  Aliens.
[19:35.090 --> 19:36.410]  The second one?
[19:37.170 --> 19:37.730]  Uh...
[19:37.730 --> 19:38.110]  The second one.
[19:38.110 --> 19:38.430]  20.
[19:39.010 --> 19:40.090]  25.
[19:40.710 --> 19:41.510]  26.
[19:42.110 --> 19:42.570]  50.
[19:43.150 --> 19:43.370]  Fuck.
[19:43.490 --> 19:43.870]  Wow!
[19:44.470 --> 19:45.050]  Fuck.
[19:45.390 --> 19:45.830]  51.
[19:46.850 --> 19:47.550]  51!
[19:49.110 --> 19:49.290]  52.
[19:50.270 --> 19:51.410]  Gavin with 52.
[19:51.830 --> 19:52.530]  53.
[19:52.910 --> 19:53.330]  60.
[19:54.330 --> 19:54.990]  70.
[19:55.510 --> 19:56.090]  Whoa!
[19:56.250 --> 19:56.690]  70!
[19:57.030 --> 19:58.930]  Gavin with 70!
[20:01.650 --> 20:02.170]  80.
[20:07.250 --> 20:08.570]  Eric with 80.
[20:09.490 --> 20:10.490]  Go ahead, guys.
[20:11.590 --> 20:12.010]  Oh, okay.
[20:12.110 --> 20:12.370]  81.
[20:14.610 --> 20:15.630]  I'm fine with that.
[20:16.430 --> 20:19.890]  You're giving it up, Eric, with him giving it to 81?
[20:20.830 --> 20:21.830]  Anyone else want to go in?
[20:22.350 --> 20:22.530]  No.
[20:23.310 --> 20:23.510]  No.
[20:24.090 --> 20:24.590]  Okay.
[20:25.150 --> 20:28.530]  Gavin gets aliens with 81 points.
[20:29.670 --> 20:30.190]  Insane.
[20:30.990 --> 20:31.390]  Pricey.
[20:32.950 --> 20:36.270]  This DVD pack is going to be so cool.
[20:36.470 --> 20:37.850]  People are going to go, he's got aliens?
[20:38.150 --> 20:38.850]  And then what else?
[20:38.930 --> 20:39.630]  Oh, fuck, man.
[20:39.670 --> 20:40.090]  I don't know.
[20:40.230 --> 20:42.110]  I'm excited for the other lesser-known alien movies.
[20:42.810 --> 20:46.090]  I've got aliens and the 1932 edition of The Moment.
[20:47.630 --> 20:50.130]  If you like Brendan Fraser, you're going to hate this.
[20:52.070 --> 20:53.030]  Geoff, you're on the board.
[20:53.590 --> 20:55.710]  I would like to nominate for one point.
[20:55.770 --> 20:56.350]  It follows.
[20:57.450 --> 20:57.850]  Ooh.
[20:58.650 --> 20:59.450]  Oh, yeah.
[20:59.710 --> 20:59.950]  Two.
[21:00.790 --> 21:01.510]  Five.
[21:02.250 --> 21:02.870]  Six.
[21:04.770 --> 21:04.910]  Seven.
[21:05.910 --> 21:06.630]  Eight.
[21:07.590 --> 21:07.930]  Ten.
[21:09.150 --> 21:09.690]  Eleven.
[21:10.710 --> 21:11.430]  Twelve.
[21:11.590 --> 21:11.950]  Twelve.
[21:12.350 --> 21:12.670]  Thirteen.
[21:13.970 --> 21:16.510]  That's like the worst adding game ever.
[21:16.730 --> 21:17.330]  Fifteen.
[21:17.790 --> 21:18.150]  Twenty.
[21:18.290 --> 21:18.490]  Wow.
[21:19.050 --> 21:20.010]  Whoa, Gavin.
[21:20.190 --> 21:20.850]  Gavin's out.
[21:21.550 --> 21:22.050]  Seventeen.
[21:22.350 --> 21:24.410]  No, no, we're already at twenty.
[21:24.850 --> 21:25.990]  Twenty-five.
[21:29.950 --> 21:30.590]  Twenty-six.
[21:30.670 --> 21:31.710]  I don't know why you want it so bad.
[21:33.050 --> 21:35.370]  Nothing I'm going for is going to bleed money out of me.
[21:35.450 --> 21:38.430]  So if I have to spend money on this, I just have a theme I'm going with.
[21:38.950 --> 21:39.590]  Twenty-seven.
[21:39.690 --> 21:40.410]  I also have a theme.
[21:41.010 --> 21:41.330]  Okay.
[21:41.510 --> 21:41.830]  Thirty.
[21:43.090 --> 21:43.890]  You can have it.
[21:44.750 --> 21:44.970]  Okay.
[21:45.070 --> 21:45.290]  Thirty.
[21:45.430 --> 21:45.750]  Wow.
[21:45.890 --> 21:46.230]  We'll take it.
[21:46.450 --> 21:46.870]  You can have it.
[21:47.450 --> 21:49.050]  Thirty for Geoff for It Follows.
[21:50.170 --> 21:51.750]  What number was that, Geoff, on the list?
[21:53.270 --> 21:54.170]  It was number thirty.
[21:55.210 --> 21:55.730]  No, it wasn't.
[21:55.730 --> 21:55.970]  It's not.
[21:55.990 --> 21:57.110]  It's just how much I had to pay for it.
[21:57.190 --> 21:57.590]  I don't know.
[21:57.790 --> 21:58.210]  It's your list.
[21:59.910 --> 22:00.690]  Forty-seven.
[22:01.290 --> 22:01.950]  Thank you.
[22:02.790 --> 22:03.310]  All right, Nick.
[22:03.350 --> 22:04.310]  Next up, Nick.
[22:05.130 --> 22:07.710]  I would like to nominate Alien.
[22:08.010 --> 22:08.330]  One.
[22:09.270 --> 22:09.830]  Five.
[22:10.230 --> 22:10.770]  Forty.
[22:11.670 --> 22:12.230]  Seventeen.
[22:12.810 --> 22:13.350]  Fuck.
[22:14.790 --> 22:15.490]  Eric with forty.
[22:15.950 --> 22:16.190]  Yep.
[22:16.810 --> 22:18.230]  Anyone going above Eric with forty?
[22:19.350 --> 22:19.970]  Going once.
[22:20.830 --> 22:21.870]  Going twice.
[22:23.150 --> 22:25.410]  Sold to Eric with forty points.
[22:25.410 --> 22:28.870]  I this this DVD set rocks.
[22:29.030 --> 22:31.210]  This is fucking awesome.
[22:31.450 --> 22:35.210]  This is so good, and I only need one more movie.
[22:35.390 --> 22:36.670]  Oh, my God.
[22:36.850 --> 22:37.990]  This is awesome.
[22:38.310 --> 22:41.910]  I don't like that you're just going to be walking around with forty-three.
[22:42.370 --> 22:43.110]  Like, I've got four.
[22:43.250 --> 22:44.250]  I have so much.
[22:44.430 --> 22:48.530]  Gavin needs four more movies and has seventeen to spend.
[22:49.270 --> 22:51.490]  You have thirty-nine and need three.
[22:51.790 --> 22:53.830]  I have forty-three points to spend on one more.
[22:53.910 --> 22:55.190]  I feel so good about this.
[22:55.410 --> 22:57.030]  And they're good, too.
[22:57.690 --> 22:59.570]  Oh, my God.
[22:59.730 --> 23:01.830]  Nick has ninety-eight points and needs five movies.
[23:03.090 --> 23:05.290]  Let me tell you, it's all working out perfectly.
[23:05.610 --> 23:06.810]  Oh, that's great.
[23:07.090 --> 23:08.290]  It's all coming together.
[23:08.870 --> 23:13.990]  I'm going to go with number 115, Cloverfield.
[23:14.770 --> 23:15.330]  One.
[23:16.070 --> 23:16.510]  Two.
[23:19.880 --> 23:21.000]  Two going one.
[23:22.060 --> 23:23.000]  I don't want it.
[23:23.520 --> 23:24.560]  You said two.
[23:25.460 --> 23:26.240]  I did.
[23:26.240 --> 23:27.320]  Two going two.
[23:30.280 --> 23:32.100]  Sold to Nick for two points.
[23:33.340 --> 23:34.440]  This is going...
[23:34.440 --> 23:36.240]  Guys, this is going perfectly for Nick.
[23:36.980 --> 23:39.020]  Did you want Cloverfield?
[23:39.500 --> 23:40.660]  No, it's going pretty well now.
[23:40.780 --> 23:41.600]  It was going perfectly.
[23:41.740 --> 23:42.520]  Now it's going pretty well.
[23:47.520 --> 23:48.120]  It's all right.
[23:48.200 --> 23:48.640]  I'm going to pivot.
[23:48.820 --> 23:49.180]  Here we go.
[23:50.120 --> 23:51.460]  I like Cloverfield a lot.
[23:51.620 --> 23:52.000]  I just...
[23:52.000 --> 23:52.640]  Yeah, I don't know.
[23:53.320 --> 23:54.840]  Yeah, I just don't want it on my DVD pack.
[23:54.840 --> 23:55.420]  Yeah, absolutely.
[23:55.640 --> 23:56.100]  I don't either.
[23:56.240 --> 23:56.460]  No.
[23:58.160 --> 24:00.000]  And yet you put two down.
[24:00.400 --> 24:01.500]  Well, let's be honest.
[24:01.540 --> 24:02.780]  I was trying to drive up the price.
[24:02.940 --> 24:05.140]  You drove it all the way up to two.
[24:05.460 --> 24:07.300]  I was negotiating in bad faith.
[24:09.440 --> 24:10.340]  Oh, man.
[24:10.460 --> 24:10.780]  Okay.
[24:10.840 --> 24:11.980]  What do I want to nominate?
[24:13.960 --> 24:16.480]  A lot of good movies on this list.
[24:19.020 --> 24:20.560]  I'm going to nominate...
[24:21.560 --> 24:22.260]  God damn it.
[24:22.440 --> 24:23.360]  Train to Busan.
[24:24.480 --> 24:25.120]  One point.
[24:25.720 --> 24:26.300]  Two.
[24:27.380 --> 24:27.960]  Three.
[24:28.680 --> 24:29.260]  Four.
[24:30.400 --> 24:30.980]  Five.
[24:31.540 --> 24:32.020]  Ten.
[24:33.280 --> 24:33.860]  Eleven.
[24:34.840 --> 24:35.420]  Twelve.
[24:37.660 --> 24:39.180]  I think that's it for me.
[24:40.140 --> 24:41.900]  I'm not putting any other bids in.
[24:41.960 --> 24:42.640]  Is anyone else?
[24:43.200 --> 24:45.540]  Train to Busan going once?
[24:48.100 --> 24:48.680]  Twice?
[24:50.660 --> 24:52.880]  Sold to Nick for 12 points.
[24:53.600 --> 24:54.340]  Is that good, Nick?
[24:54.400 --> 24:55.060]  Is that what you wanted?
[24:55.120 --> 24:56.340]  It is what I wanted.
[24:56.520 --> 24:56.820]  Great movie.
[24:57.040 --> 24:58.420]  Still going pretty well, is it?
[24:58.960 --> 25:00.200]  We're back on track.
[25:03.480 --> 25:04.420]  Back on track.
[25:04.520 --> 25:05.480]  We fired the first guy.
[25:05.660 --> 25:06.400]  Back on track.
[25:07.060 --> 25:07.320]  Okay.
[25:08.660 --> 25:09.940]  Gavin, it's your nomination.
[25:10.800 --> 25:13.900]  Oh, I'm going to pick Ringu.
[25:16.080 --> 25:17.040]  Oh, interesting.
[25:18.540 --> 25:19.460]  That's a good one.
[25:21.620 --> 25:22.100]  One.
[25:23.260 --> 25:24.580]  Oh, you won it.
[25:26.180 --> 25:28.520]  Do you want to throw a number in there?
[25:29.300 --> 25:30.760]  No, I think I learned my lesson.
[25:31.680 --> 25:33.960]  I think I learned from my mistake.
[25:34.500 --> 25:36.160]  Okay, with one going once.
[25:37.440 --> 25:37.960]  Twice.
[25:39.400 --> 25:41.500]  Sold to Gavin for one point.
[25:42.000 --> 25:42.220]  Ringu.
[25:43.140 --> 25:43.460]  Sick.
[25:44.580 --> 25:44.940]  Nice.
[25:45.120 --> 25:46.120]  Supposed to be terrifying.
[25:46.320 --> 25:46.980]  Never seen it.
[25:47.440 --> 25:48.040]  Very good.
[25:48.680 --> 25:49.980]  Better than the American version.
[25:50.260 --> 25:51.640]  It is definitely better than the American one.
[25:51.640 --> 25:55.200]  I'm interested what they'll do with the next American version,
[25:55.340 --> 25:58.620]  because they literally ended the world with the last film.
[25:59.080 --> 26:00.740]  How many Ring films are there?
[26:01.280 --> 26:03.500]  At least three, I think, right?
[26:03.940 --> 26:05.280]  Really? I thought there was two.
[26:06.000 --> 26:09.320]  No, they did one with Johnny Galecki a few years ago.
[26:11.020 --> 26:12.460]  And it's not good.
[26:13.440 --> 26:14.420]  Real bad Ring movie.
[26:15.600 --> 26:18.580]  Your earbud fell in a coffee cup.
[26:18.580 --> 26:21.660]  You need a taco, pick me up.
[26:22.460 --> 26:26.000]  When modern life gets rough, grab the timeless taste you love.
[26:26.320 --> 26:28.340]  Paso the old El Paso.

[26:52.000 --> 26:55.520]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[26:55.860 --> 26:57.380]  Available for a limited time.
[26:57.640 --> 26:59.800]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[27:00.340 --> 27:01.200]  Next up is Jeff.
[27:02.840 --> 27:05.180]  I'm going to nominate Barbarian.
[27:05.860 --> 27:08.040]  Oh, I still haven't seen it.
[27:08.380 --> 27:09.060]  Very good.
[27:10.060 --> 27:12.320]  I'll put four down on Barbarian.
[27:12.780 --> 27:13.600]  I'll do five.
[27:14.460 --> 27:14.900]  Damn.
[27:17.800 --> 27:18.240]  Seven.
[27:19.300 --> 27:19.740]  Ooh.
[27:20.840 --> 27:21.280]  Eight.
[27:22.280 --> 27:23.380]  Okay, nine.
[27:25.100 --> 27:26.000]  Right, he's like...
[27:27.020 --> 27:27.900]  You upset?
[27:28.120 --> 27:28.620]  So irritating.
[27:28.620 --> 27:29.320]  He's so annoyed.
[27:29.600 --> 27:31.040]  The idea of being so annoyed.
[27:31.100 --> 27:32.900]  It's just like Gavin gets every fucking movie he wants.
[27:33.000 --> 27:34.260]  Everybody else gets a movie for one.
[27:34.380 --> 27:36.740]  I have one movie that nobody really wants but...
[27:36.740 --> 27:37.560]  I really like Barbarian.
[27:38.140 --> 27:38.720]  Even though I have it.
[27:38.720 --> 27:40.140]  Then you should have fucking picked it.
[27:45.450 --> 27:46.110]  Where are we at?
[27:46.130 --> 27:46.690]  Only you have it.
[27:46.690 --> 27:47.410]  No, it's fine.
[27:47.470 --> 27:48.070]  I'll let you have it.
[27:48.130 --> 27:48.830]  No, where are we at?
[27:49.130 --> 27:49.850]  You got it for nine.
[27:50.450 --> 27:51.310]  Okay, I'll take it.
[27:52.710 --> 27:53.950]  Jeff's taking it for nine.
[27:54.310 --> 27:56.010]  Is this how negotiations work?
[27:57.250 --> 27:58.830]  Hey, I got it for cheaper than I would have.
[27:59.190 --> 27:59.430]  Yeah.
[27:59.510 --> 28:00.650]  Not the way I tried it.
[28:03.050 --> 28:04.410]  You just scared everyone off.
[28:05.370 --> 28:05.690]  No.
[28:07.170 --> 28:08.690]  Barbarian sold to Jeff for nine.
[28:12.730 --> 28:14.650]  You're going to let me buy this so I'm going to kick your...
[28:16.790 --> 28:17.610]  Holy shit.
[28:17.610 --> 28:19.250]  That'd be the best studio ever.
[28:19.390 --> 28:19.650]  Fuck.
[28:20.290 --> 28:20.850]  Uh, Nick.
[28:21.730 --> 28:23.650]  Well, I'm going to nominate...
[28:24.750 --> 28:25.710]  It 2017.
[28:27.030 --> 28:27.990]  Very popular.
[28:28.290 --> 28:29.170]  Don't want it at all.
[28:29.490 --> 28:30.210]  Zero interest.
[28:31.010 --> 28:32.150]  I didn't like those movies.
[28:32.890 --> 28:33.490]  Minus one.
[28:34.290 --> 28:36.770]  You want points back and you want it to go away.
[28:38.890 --> 28:40.690]  If you're trying to get back up to 17.
[28:41.870 --> 28:43.650]  Anyone going to bid on It 2017?
[28:44.570 --> 28:44.890]  No.
[28:45.650 --> 28:45.970]  No.
[28:45.970 --> 28:47.470]  Okay, get rid of it.
[28:47.490 --> 28:47.890]  It's dead.
[28:48.030 --> 28:48.890]  Not even Jeff.
[28:49.450 --> 28:50.850]  What doesn't fit in with what I'm doing?
[28:52.590 --> 28:58.290]  Okay, I'm going to throw one out there and see if it lands in what Jeff is trying to do.
[28:59.770 --> 29:01.330]  I'm going to go with...
[29:01.330 --> 29:02.070]  Oh, where did it?
[29:02.130 --> 29:04.010]  I'm trying to find what number it ended up at.
[29:04.090 --> 29:04.990]  Hang on just a second.
[29:05.310 --> 29:05.890]  It is...
[29:09.580 --> 29:11.540]  It's Scanners at number 36.
[29:12.380 --> 29:14.020]  So the one with the bloke's head goes...
[29:14.020 --> 29:15.060]  It does.
[29:15.360 --> 29:16.140]  That's it.
[29:17.020 --> 29:17.380]  One.
[29:20.860 --> 29:21.940]  I have zero trust.
[29:22.080 --> 29:22.920]  I'm not bidding on Scanners.
[29:23.560 --> 29:24.120]  Yeah, I'm good.
[29:25.120 --> 29:25.900]  Don't know what it is.
[29:26.220 --> 29:26.740]  There you go.
[29:27.180 --> 29:28.320]  Yeah, Gavin has it at one.
[29:28.420 --> 29:30.180]  We don't even need to really deliberate on that one.
[29:30.440 --> 29:30.960]  Gavin, congrats.
[29:31.380 --> 29:33.960]  I need these ones when I've got 15 points.
[29:34.000 --> 29:37.600]  Hey, I was going to say, honestly, your lineup, not bad.
[29:37.760 --> 29:39.240]  Scanners, like...
[29:39.240 --> 29:41.660]  I feel like Scanners is one that people have...
[29:41.660 --> 29:43.120]  They know of, but haven't seen yet.
[29:43.140 --> 29:45.320]  So maybe that'll make them want to get this box.
[29:45.320 --> 29:49.680]  You got the DVD cover of the guy's head exploding on your pack of five.
[29:50.020 --> 29:50.680]  Not bad.
[29:51.440 --> 29:51.840]  Not too bad.
[29:51.880 --> 29:54.660]  Lights, camera, clunge, coming to the movie auction, saying,
[29:54.800 --> 29:57.980]  is this the one where the head blows and then buying the rights to it?
[29:58.780 --> 30:00.500]  Not knowing anything else about it.
[30:00.860 --> 30:01.020]  Yep.
[30:01.200 --> 30:02.700]  Well, that's what the last movie auction was.
[30:02.920 --> 30:04.260]  I don't know what the hell it was.
[30:04.760 --> 30:05.200]  What?
[30:06.000 --> 30:06.440]  What?
[30:07.200 --> 30:08.640]  I can't remember the name of the film.
[30:09.680 --> 30:10.680]  Horizon, that was it.
[30:11.940 --> 30:12.620]  I got pushed.
[30:13.340 --> 30:13.780]  Andrew.
[30:13.780 --> 30:15.420]  Andrew, you're next.
[30:16.680 --> 30:18.000]  I am next.
[30:18.180 --> 30:21.800]  I'm going to put out, I think, a big horror movie.
[30:22.000 --> 30:23.580]  I think could get a lot of action.
[30:24.020 --> 30:24.900]  Evil Dead 2.
[30:25.680 --> 30:27.540]  Are there multiple Evil Deads on there?
[30:28.060 --> 30:28.500]  Yes.
[30:29.080 --> 30:30.540]  I saw Army of Darkness for sure.
[30:31.120 --> 30:33.500]  I think Evil Dead 1, 2, and Army of Darkness.
[30:34.000 --> 30:35.560]  I believe are on the list.
[30:39.310 --> 30:40.650]  It may just be Evil Dead 2.
[30:40.930 --> 30:42.030]  Nope, the Evil Dead is there.
[30:42.750 --> 30:44.970]  But I'm nominating Evil Dead 2.
[30:44.970 --> 30:45.230]  Evil Dead 2.
[30:45.970 --> 30:47.250]  Funniest horror movie ever made.
[30:48.530 --> 30:49.770]  Anyone want to bid on Evil Dead 2?
[30:50.270 --> 30:51.470]  I'll bid 10 on it.
[30:52.610 --> 30:53.550]  Jeff with 10.
[30:54.130 --> 30:55.010]  Going once.
[30:56.710 --> 30:57.950]  Jeff with 10.
[30:58.930 --> 30:59.810]  Going twice.
[31:00.590 --> 31:02.350]  Oh, I just thought of one that's not actually on the list.
[31:03.050 --> 31:03.490]  Same.
[31:04.310 --> 31:05.050]  I got a couple.
[31:05.250 --> 31:06.330]  Sold to Jeff.
[31:07.230 --> 31:07.850]  10 points.
[31:08.650 --> 31:09.330]  Evil Dead 2.
[31:11.910 --> 31:13.150]  And this still fits with what you're doing?
[31:13.650 --> 31:14.410]  It does, absolutely.
[31:14.770 --> 31:14.990]  Okay.
[31:15.550 --> 31:16.010]  Interesting.
[31:16.690 --> 31:18.170]  Well, next up is Gavin.
[31:18.390 --> 31:19.210]  Gavin, what do you think?
[31:19.910 --> 31:21.270]  Ooh, let's see.
[31:21.530 --> 31:22.650]  Let's see, shall we?
[31:24.690 --> 31:25.230]  Jaws.
[31:25.790 --> 31:26.330]  What?
[31:26.610 --> 31:26.710]  What?
[31:27.050 --> 31:27.410]  Jaws.
[31:27.970 --> 31:28.510]  Jaws?
[31:28.890 --> 31:29.430]  Yeah.
[31:29.630 --> 31:30.070]  Jaws.
[31:34.250 --> 31:35.330]  I'll put...
[31:35.870 --> 31:36.610]  Oh, fuck.
[31:36.690 --> 31:37.870]  Do I want to put anything on it?
[31:38.110 --> 31:42.230]  It's getting to a weird point with this, where the points feel like they really matter.
[31:42.870 --> 31:44.370]  I love Jaws.
[31:44.370 --> 31:48.410]  Do I want it in my DVD pack of Halloween horror?
[31:49.870 --> 31:51.730]  I don't think I do.
[31:52.830 --> 31:53.390]  I'm not...
[31:53.390 --> 31:54.490]  I don't think I'm going to bid on it.
[31:54.670 --> 31:56.870]  Gavin's getting Jaws at one?
[31:57.750 --> 31:58.250]  Oh.
[32:00.470 --> 32:01.930]  It's really good.
[32:02.870 --> 32:04.890]  Did you put a $1 bid down, Gavin, on that?
[32:05.790 --> 32:06.050]  Yeah.
[32:06.930 --> 32:08.070]  When I said one just then.
[32:11.770 --> 32:13.410]  Jaws for one, going once.
[32:16.230 --> 32:18.450]  Jaws for one, going twice.
[32:21.210 --> 32:21.850]  Sold.
[32:22.030 --> 32:23.190]  Gavin Jaws, Gavin.
[32:23.890 --> 32:24.070]  Yep.
[32:24.390 --> 32:28.430]  I can't believe I've spent three on my last three movies.
[32:28.770 --> 32:30.050]  Well, you scarred me, man.
[32:30.130 --> 32:31.090]  You scarred me.
[32:31.110 --> 32:34.130]  Yeah, you made Nick real gun-shy.
[32:34.330 --> 32:35.950]  I'm real paranoid, man.
[32:38.230 --> 32:40.190]  Next up is Geoff.
[32:41.110 --> 32:41.750]  Okay.
[32:43.130 --> 32:47.810]  Um, I am going to nominate the original Evil Dead.
[32:48.690 --> 32:49.170]  The Evil Dead.
[32:49.390 --> 32:50.490]  The Evil Dead.
[32:51.450 --> 32:53.330]  I have zero interest in bidding on it.
[32:53.490 --> 32:55.510]  Does anyone want to put a bid on the Evil Dead?
[32:58.110 --> 32:58.770]  It doesn't sound like...
[32:58.770 --> 32:59.370]  I'll put a bid for one.
[32:59.530 --> 33:00.930]  Sorry, it's for me, but one for me.
[33:01.070 --> 33:01.170]  Sorry.
[33:01.910 --> 33:02.170]  Okay.
[33:03.110 --> 33:03.630]  Geoff with one.
[33:05.350 --> 33:06.690]  Geoff with one, going once.
[33:09.050 --> 33:10.890]  Geoff with one, going twice.
[33:11.190 --> 33:11.470]  Two.
[33:12.690 --> 33:13.450]  Ooh.
[33:13.650 --> 33:14.470]  Big bid.
[33:14.510 --> 33:15.690]  We're in a bidding war.
[33:16.190 --> 33:17.890]  Big ol' bid from Nick.
[33:18.170 --> 33:19.330]  Alright, I'll go up to three.
[33:20.290 --> 33:21.050]  Four.
[33:21.550 --> 33:22.670]  Ooh, Nick with four.
[33:23.230 --> 33:24.150]  Nick with four.
[33:26.370 --> 33:27.130]  Six.
[33:28.390 --> 33:29.990]  Geoff with six.
[33:32.050 --> 33:33.570]  Going once.
[33:35.230 --> 33:35.990]  Twice.
[33:36.950 --> 33:38.270]  I'm done, your honor.
[33:38.870 --> 33:41.910]  Sold to Geoff for six points.
[33:42.090 --> 33:44.110]  You didn't even have to get yelled at, Nick.
[33:45.430 --> 33:46.270]  No, yeah.
[33:46.430 --> 33:47.480]  It would have gotten there.
[33:48.690 --> 33:50.730]  Did you say it would have gotten there?
[33:50.830 --> 33:51.950]  We would have gotten there, yeah.
[33:53.070 --> 33:55.070]  What was your yelling number, Geoff?
[33:55.390 --> 33:56.110]  Oh, I don't know.
[33:56.410 --> 33:57.770]  Anything after probably 12.
[33:59.350 --> 34:00.790]  This is ridiculous.
[34:02.310 --> 34:06.690]  I like the idea of like an auction where your paddles are going up back and forth and you're
[34:06.690 --> 34:09.190]  looking at the other person going, what the fuck are you doing?
[34:09.310 --> 34:11.470]  And just keeping raising your own bid.
[34:12.810 --> 34:14.170]  Next up, we got Nick.
[34:14.270 --> 34:15.010]  Nick, what do you think?
[34:16.370 --> 34:18.730]  Number 81, 28 days later.
[34:18.990 --> 34:21.410]  Oh, great movie.
[34:22.410 --> 34:25.210]  Long awaited third part coming out soon.
[34:27.070 --> 34:28.190]  Oh, boy.
[34:30.150 --> 34:30.710]  I'll...
[34:30.710 --> 34:31.970]  I'll put one down.
[34:33.330 --> 34:34.270]  28 days later.
[34:34.830 --> 34:35.470]  Oh, I'll do two.
[34:36.690 --> 34:37.690]  Too rich for my blood.
[34:39.430 --> 34:41.110]  That's how you drive the price up, Nick.
[34:43.730 --> 34:45.250]  It's all coming together.
[34:45.990 --> 34:46.550]  Okay.
[34:47.930 --> 34:49.250]  28 days later.
[34:49.670 --> 34:52.550]  Anyone else going to Nick for two points?
[34:53.930 --> 34:54.170]  Okay.
[34:55.150 --> 34:55.810]  Okay, Nick.
[34:56.450 --> 34:57.090]  With two points.
[34:57.090 --> 34:57.470]  Look at all that money.
[34:57.870 --> 34:59.010]  Okay, I got my next...
[34:59.870 --> 35:00.690]  next one.
[35:00.830 --> 35:05.450]  I'm gonna go with number 101, The Shining.
[35:06.090 --> 35:06.650]  Ooh.
[35:10.070 --> 35:10.630]  14.
[35:11.470 --> 35:12.030]  15.
[35:13.250 --> 35:14.510]  Oh, 16.
[35:14.510 --> 35:17.310]  You're going for a real isolationist style of movies here.
[35:18.990 --> 35:19.550]  27.
[35:22.330 --> 35:23.130]  Jeff's out.
[35:27.510 --> 35:30.190]  Will Andrew or Moneybags throw in a bid?
[35:30.190 --> 35:30.730]  No, I'm good.
[35:30.770 --> 35:32.890]  I'm good with giving Eric The Shining.
[35:33.150 --> 35:33.930]  Yeah, he can have it.
[35:34.150 --> 35:34.330]  27.
[35:35.730 --> 35:36.870]  Shining for 27.
[35:36.870 --> 35:38.190]  Going once to Eric.
[35:38.290 --> 35:39.890]  Got points left over, baby.
[35:41.370 --> 35:43.110]  Going twice to Eric.
[35:44.670 --> 35:50.770]  Sold to Eric for 27 points rounding out his Halloween War box set.
[35:51.270 --> 35:51.530]  Love it.
[35:52.030 --> 35:52.910]  It's a good value, Eric.
[35:53.170 --> 35:54.170]  Nothing but hits, baby.
[35:54.970 --> 35:58.630]  I stopped there because I realized it would get out your other points
[35:58.630 --> 36:00.810]  and that was more valuable to me than The Shining.
[36:01.430 --> 36:04.950]  Not having to deal with you potentially just throwing 43 points
[36:04.950 --> 36:05.970]  at whatever you wanted to.
[36:06.170 --> 36:07.610]  That's exactly what was about to happen.
[36:09.550 --> 36:10.310]  I'm back up.
[36:10.470 --> 36:11.670]  But Andrew, yeah, you're up.
[36:11.870 --> 36:13.070]  Oh boy, okay.
[36:15.630 --> 36:18.170]  It's really, it's difficult to like have a theme.
[36:19.270 --> 36:20.570]  What you laughing at, Gavin?
[36:21.110 --> 36:21.910]  What am I laughing at?
[36:21.950 --> 36:23.190]  What you laughing at?
[36:23.790 --> 36:27.510]  I just like, whenever it's your turn, you're like, is it my turn?
[36:27.670 --> 36:30.970]  Well, it's because I'm navigating, I'm putting updates on the board.
[36:31.090 --> 36:31.790]  I'm doing stuff.
[36:31.830 --> 36:33.130]  I can't just sit idly.
[36:33.130 --> 36:33.930]  No, I know.
[36:33.990 --> 36:38.170]  But then you go, oh boy, like you didn't expect that.
[36:38.370 --> 36:40.630]  Yeah, no, this is a big decision.
[36:40.730 --> 36:43.410]  Listen, we had a great year at my studio.
[36:43.930 --> 36:44.990]  This is important.
[36:45.110 --> 36:46.430]  We want to carry it into the fall.
[36:47.070 --> 36:50.010]  I am going to nominate Bone Tomahawk one point.
[36:51.090 --> 36:52.450]  Is that Matthew Fox in that movie?
[36:52.710 --> 36:53.090]  He is.
[36:53.390 --> 36:53.970]  I don't know anything about that movie.
[36:54.710 --> 36:55.590]  Matthew Fox is in it.
[36:56.290 --> 36:56.830]  Kurt Russell.
[36:57.130 --> 36:57.870]  He's looking old.
[36:58.770 --> 36:59.830]  He is looking old.
[37:00.030 --> 37:00.470]  Oh man.
[37:01.350 --> 37:03.510]  Bone Tomahawk, to me, going once.
[37:04.330 --> 37:05.130]  With one.
[37:06.870 --> 37:07.310]  Twice.
[37:09.290 --> 37:11.050]  Sold to me for one point.
[37:11.450 --> 37:12.170]  I like that a lot.
[37:12.250 --> 37:13.890]  I know that's not a popular movie.
[37:14.250 --> 37:15.730]  One of my favorite movies of all time.
[37:15.930 --> 37:16.570]  I love Bone Tomahawk.
[37:16.590 --> 37:17.190]  Oh wow, really?
[37:17.430 --> 37:20.470]  I think it's so well written and it's such a good...
[37:22.450 --> 37:24.130]  I'm blanking his name right now.
[37:24.210 --> 37:26.830]  He's a character actor, Richard Jennings?
[37:26.950 --> 37:27.610]  Is that his name?
[37:28.310 --> 37:29.450]  He's in Burn After Reading.
[37:30.250 --> 37:34.030]  Uh, he was in Cabin in the Woods as like the IT guy.
[37:34.390 --> 37:35.630]  The guy from Step Brothers?
[37:35.830 --> 37:36.230]  Yeah.
[37:37.110 --> 37:38.030]  And Me, Myself, Barry?
[37:38.370 --> 37:38.810]  Yeah.
[37:39.610 --> 37:41.230]  Well, I haven't seen that, so I don't know about that.
[37:43.090 --> 37:44.510]  He's fantastic in it.
[37:44.690 --> 37:45.650]  I love... it's a great movie.
[37:45.910 --> 37:46.850]  Love Bone Tomahawk.
[37:47.690 --> 37:48.810]  Okay, next up.
[37:49.290 --> 37:49.590]  Gavin.
[37:57.830 --> 37:58.270]  Psycho.
[37:59.050 --> 37:59.490]  Ooh.
[38:02.310 --> 38:03.190]  Not interested.
[38:04.170 --> 38:04.550]  I'm good.
[38:05.490 --> 38:05.830]  Oh, cool.
[38:06.110 --> 38:07.050]  Does anyone want it?
[38:07.830 --> 38:08.250]  Not particularly.
[38:08.430 --> 38:08.570]  One.
[38:14.030 --> 38:15.330]  Gavin with one.
[38:15.950 --> 38:16.830]  Going once.
[38:17.590 --> 38:18.670]  What number is it, Gavin?
[38:20.430 --> 38:21.690]  Uh, that's a good question.
[38:23.050 --> 38:23.530]  Going twice.
[38:23.530 --> 38:26.110]  Yeah, it's one we've been asking over and over the whole time we've been doing this.
[38:26.230 --> 38:26.330]  Yeah.
[38:28.630 --> 38:30.950]  Gavin gets Psycho with one point.
[38:31.250 --> 38:33.810]  Rounding out his film collection.
[38:34.610 --> 38:35.150]  My theme?
[38:35.930 --> 38:37.150]  One Word Bangers.
[38:40.570 --> 38:41.530]  It's pretty good.
[38:41.710 --> 38:42.230]  I don't think that...
[38:42.230 --> 38:42.570]  There you go.
[38:42.730 --> 38:45.370]  I don't know if people buy it for that, but I do.
[38:45.510 --> 38:46.370]  I think it's very cool.
[38:46.730 --> 38:48.790]  Are you gonna put that on like the front box of it?
[38:49.110 --> 38:49.290]  Yeah.
[38:49.530 --> 38:50.350]  One Word Bangers?
[38:50.590 --> 38:50.850]  Yep.
[38:51.030 --> 38:51.450]  Like it.
[38:51.950 --> 38:52.910]  Buy Lights, Camera, Clunch.
[38:56.490 --> 38:56.930]  Okay.
[38:58.690 --> 38:59.790]  I'll throw out...
[39:00.970 --> 39:02.410]  Has anybody said The Exorcist yet?
[39:03.130 --> 39:03.450]  No.
[39:03.790 --> 39:04.870]  No, not on the list.
[39:05.190 --> 39:05.950]  Hey, what happens...
[39:06.810 --> 39:09.830]  Like, do we just go till we run out of money or do we have to stop picking at some point?
[39:09.850 --> 39:11.270]  Once you have five, you're done.
[39:11.730 --> 39:11.930]  Yep.
[39:12.090 --> 39:13.650]  But it keeps going until everybody has five.
[39:13.730 --> 39:15.790]  Like, you can't end up with money and...
[39:15.790 --> 39:17.230]  Okay, then I'll throw The Exorcist out there.
[39:17.710 --> 39:20.890]  I will put five in for The Exorcist.
[39:21.410 --> 39:22.470]  You got five on it.
[39:23.090 --> 39:24.050]  I got five.
[39:25.150 --> 39:25.830]  Is that it?
[39:26.430 --> 39:27.390]  No one else wants it?
[39:27.390 --> 39:28.390]  Yeah, I don't want it.
[39:28.510 --> 39:29.530]  I just want to get it out of the way.
[39:29.750 --> 39:30.350]  You got it.
[39:30.690 --> 39:32.590]  I'll gladly take The Exorcist five.
[39:32.710 --> 39:33.270]  I just want to get it out of the way.
[39:33.310 --> 39:34.150]  I just want to... yeah.
[39:35.370 --> 39:37.410]  He got The Thing and The Exorcist.
[39:37.610 --> 39:38.690]  He's got a great list going.
[39:39.030 --> 39:39.930]  And Anaconda.
[39:40.970 --> 39:44.050]  All that and J-Lo and Owen Wilson.
[39:44.690 --> 39:45.890]  And Eric Stoltz.
[39:46.010 --> 39:46.870]  And Eric Stoltz.
[39:47.050 --> 39:50.970]  He eats a fucking wasp or something and then disappears for the rest of the movie.
[39:52.470 --> 39:53.410]  I like it.
[39:53.530 --> 39:56.510]  Okay, well, no one else apparently wants it.
[39:57.070 --> 39:57.770]  Last chance.
[39:59.290 --> 40:01.210]  Sold to me for five points.
[40:02.090 --> 40:02.570]  Wow.
[40:03.150 --> 40:06.310]  If we fill our slots, can we bid again and trash another one?
[40:06.710 --> 40:07.030]  No.
[40:07.590 --> 40:08.030]  It's unfortunate.
[40:09.270 --> 40:10.110]  You're out. You're done.
[40:10.510 --> 40:11.970]  That does happen in real Hollywood though.
[40:12.070 --> 40:13.310]  It would be burning the funds.
[40:14.490 --> 40:15.490]  I wouldn't get a refund.
[40:16.530 --> 40:16.710]  No.
[40:17.310 --> 40:17.490]  Okay.
[40:18.150 --> 40:18.630]  Nick.
[40:19.250 --> 40:23.370]  I would like to nominate number 50, Dawn of the Dead from 2004.
[40:23.570 --> 40:24.730]  Oh, that's real good.
[40:25.370 --> 40:26.870]  It's a fun zombie movie.
[40:27.390 --> 40:29.030]  Maybe Zack Snyder's best.
[40:29.410 --> 40:31.170]  I'm going to end that one over the original, huh?
[40:31.550 --> 40:32.330]  I think it is.
[40:32.510 --> 40:33.950]  I mean, they're very different movies.
[40:34.070 --> 40:35.030]  They're going for different things.
[40:35.850 --> 40:36.850]  Very different movies.
[40:37.230 --> 40:38.630]  I'd like to put a one on that.
[40:42.050 --> 40:43.090]  I think you should.
[40:44.850 --> 40:47.610]  No, I want, there's something else I want on this.
[40:47.750 --> 40:49.190]  I want, I want some, Nick, you can have it.
[40:49.970 --> 40:50.350]  All right.
[40:50.450 --> 40:51.790]  You don't want to get in on this anyway.
[40:54.830 --> 40:57.450]  I don't want to fight your 82 points.
[40:57.450 --> 40:58.530]  He has 82.
[40:58.670 --> 41:00.230]  Well, now he has 81 points.
[41:00.330 --> 41:02.130]  If you can knock his one point off of there.
[41:02.270 --> 41:05.050]  So he's got, he's got a lot to spend on his last movie.
[41:05.110 --> 41:06.530]  This studio is saving money.
[41:06.610 --> 41:10.130]  If he doesn't spend a lot on that last movie, think of the marketing budget he's going to have.
[41:11.570 --> 41:13.930]  He's going to have 80 points of marketing budget.
[41:13.950 --> 41:14.670]  Way to go, man.
[41:15.930 --> 41:17.490]  I own Regulatrion, baby.
[41:19.670 --> 41:21.050]  Well, I'm, I'm out.
[41:21.110 --> 41:21.770]  So I guess I'm not nominated.
[41:22.410 --> 41:23.770]  So it goes back up to Andrew.
[41:23.950 --> 41:25.490]  Goes back to me.
[41:26.530 --> 41:27.350]  Is it your turn?
[41:27.830 --> 41:28.990]  It is my turn.
[41:29.950 --> 41:31.990]  I'm going to nominate Scream.
[41:33.650 --> 41:34.690]  I'm going to nominate.
[41:36.050 --> 41:38.470]  I'm going to put, ah, fuck it.
[41:38.650 --> 41:40.310]  I'll put 33 points on it.
[41:40.350 --> 41:41.610]  I only have one movie left anyway.
[41:42.070 --> 41:42.290]  Wow.
[41:42.710 --> 41:43.150]  33 on Scream.
[41:44.090 --> 41:47.030]  I want a fun slasher movie as part of my box set.
[41:47.830 --> 41:49.670]  That was the last movie I wanted.
[41:49.670 --> 41:53.030]  I was hoping to bleed you guys out before I could get it, but that's okay.
[41:53.190 --> 41:54.070]  Enjoy Scream.
[41:54.990 --> 41:58.110]  Can I, can I bid and sell it to someone else?
[42:02.270 --> 42:04.750]  I'm putting Scream in for 33.
[42:05.070 --> 42:05.210]  Yep.
[42:05.350 --> 42:06.710]  That doesn't sound like any opposition.
[42:07.550 --> 42:08.830]  That is my last film.
[42:09.230 --> 42:11.370]  I got some serious heavy hitters.
[42:11.450 --> 42:12.690]  I got some fun popcorn.
[42:13.050 --> 42:14.130]  I really like my box set.
[42:14.490 --> 42:15.170]  All right.
[42:18.130 --> 42:21.770]  Jeff, you can nominate a movie that you want or maybe just one you want to get off the board.
[42:21.910 --> 42:22.310]  Either way.
[42:22.870 --> 42:26.350]  I'm going to nominate A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night.
[42:26.590 --> 42:28.530]  It's an, I believe an Iranian film, isn't it?
[42:29.170 --> 42:30.030]  I have no idea.
[42:30.130 --> 42:31.370]  I don't really know anything about it.
[42:31.670 --> 42:34.270]  I think you could bid one point and you'll get it for that.
[42:34.570 --> 42:35.970]  I'm going to bid one point.
[42:36.430 --> 42:36.550]  Yeah.
[42:37.070 --> 42:38.730]  I'm excited to learn Jeff's theme.
[42:39.530 --> 42:41.250]  Yeah, it's an Iranian ghost story.
[42:42.250 --> 42:43.290]  I always want to see it.
[42:43.350 --> 42:43.690]  I've never seen it.
[42:43.690 --> 42:45.630]  Okay, Jeff got it for one.
[42:46.010 --> 42:48.390]  Yeah, sold to Jeff.
[42:48.810 --> 42:52.050]  And then, Nick, I guess, what do you want?
[42:52.650 --> 42:53.610]  I'm going to go with...
[42:54.770 --> 42:57.070]  Dick with 81 points and nobody else.
[42:59.390 --> 43:00.830]  Number 51, Wreck.
[43:01.370 --> 43:01.810]  Wreck.
[43:02.330 --> 43:02.950]  Great movie.
[43:02.950 --> 43:03.410]  Oh, that's a good movie.
[43:03.850 --> 43:04.350]  That's a great movie.
[43:04.470 --> 43:04.910]  It's in brackets.
[43:04.910 --> 43:05.510]  I've never seen that.
[43:06.010 --> 43:06.610]  Yeah, real good.
[43:06.930 --> 43:07.170]  Excellent.
[43:07.390 --> 43:10.510]  Way better than, I mean, Quarantine was good, but this is way better.
[43:10.950 --> 43:11.270]  Okay.
[43:11.270 --> 43:13.750]  That was a Spanish film, right?
[43:13.910 --> 43:14.190]  It is.
[43:14.350 --> 43:14.610]  Yes.
[43:14.650 --> 43:14.770]  Yes.
[43:15.330 --> 43:15.350]  Yeah.
[43:15.350 --> 43:17.670]  And then I assume it's just one point on that, huh?
[43:18.690 --> 43:18.970]  Yeah.
[43:19.230 --> 43:19.510]  Yeah.
[43:22.150 --> 43:25.670]  So I get to walk out of here with 80 grand or whatever.
[43:25.810 --> 43:26.830]  Is that what you think it is?
[43:26.890 --> 43:30.550]  You think that each point here goes to $1,000?
[43:31.390 --> 43:31.950]  A million.
[43:33.150 --> 43:34.990]  Oh, you think it goes to a million dollars?
[43:36.010 --> 43:36.850]  I'd like it to.
[43:37.030 --> 43:40.770]  Okay, well, here's our lists.
[43:40.770 --> 43:47.970]  All together, A24, Anaconda, The Thing, Bone Tomahawk, The Exorcist and Scream,
[43:48.950 --> 43:57.310]  Gavin Studio Lights, Camera, Clunge, Aliens, Ringu, Scanners, Jaws, and Psycho,
[43:58.310 --> 44:01.950]  Jeff Studio, shh, it can hear you, Studios,
[44:03.110 --> 44:09.910]  It Follows, Barbarian, Evil Dead 2, Evil Dead, and A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night.
[44:10.650 --> 44:11.990]  What's your theme, Jeff?
[44:12.290 --> 44:15.930]  Well, let me tell you about, shh, it can hear you, Studios,
[44:16.750 --> 44:20.770]  this is, they call it, you've heard about all the major hubs,
[44:21.190 --> 44:23.650]  film hubs around the world, from Hollywood to Bollywood, right?
[44:23.910 --> 44:26.370]  But what you've never heard of is the mid-coast.
[44:26.470 --> 44:30.370]  We are bringing filmmaking back to Michigan, back to Detroit.
[44:30.670 --> 44:34.270]  Everybody knows It Follows is a Michigan-based Detroit film.
[44:34.410 --> 44:35.810]  Barbarian takes place in Michigan.
[44:36.150 --> 44:39.290]  Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 were partially filmed in Michigan.
[44:39.290 --> 44:42.210]  And some of the characters in the movies are from Michigan.
[44:42.210 --> 44:46.770]  Would have loved Don't Breathe or Bird Box or The Crow to round out my list,
[44:46.790 --> 44:48.050]  but those were not on the list.
[44:48.130 --> 44:49.290]  I didn't find out until later.
[44:49.430 --> 44:53.870]  Unfortunately, was going to pick Scream because Scream 4 was filmed in Michigan.
[44:54.050 --> 44:56.970]  So I was going to make a thing like, we're trying to bring that franchise back.
[44:57.050 --> 45:00.830]  But instead, what we have done is we've gone international.
[45:00.990 --> 45:06.530]  We found the first non-American movie that we want to bring to the States and recreate here.
[45:07.240 --> 45:08.950]  So we're going to do Michigan.
[45:10.310 --> 45:16.550]  It Can Hear You Studios is going to be going to be recreating A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night,
[45:16.610 --> 45:18.150]  but for American audiences.
[45:18.350 --> 45:19.110]  That's our studio.
[45:19.270 --> 45:21.230]  We're bringing film back to Michigan, baby.
[45:22.050 --> 45:22.550]  Wow.
[45:22.870 --> 45:23.470]  It's pretty fun.
[45:23.790 --> 45:23.870]  Great theme.
[45:24.210 --> 45:24.670]  Great theme.
[45:25.210 --> 45:25.810]  I like it.
[45:25.950 --> 45:29.750]  Nick's studio, Sauce Boss Studios, got Cloverfield, which I don't think he wanted,
[45:30.290 --> 45:30.890]  trained to Busan.
[45:31.390 --> 45:34.350]  28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead and Wreck.
[45:35.170 --> 45:37.490]  And finally, my studio...
[45:37.490 --> 45:39.030]  Well, just before we move on...
[45:40.650 --> 45:41.670]  Yeah, what's up?
[45:42.210 --> 45:45.830]  Nick, your studio, clearly, you wanted all zombies is what I'm guessing.
[45:46.310 --> 45:52.770]  Yeah, so what we've done here is world-ending scenarios.
[45:54.270 --> 45:55.090]  Very good.
[45:55.310 --> 45:55.790]  And zombies.
[45:56.790 --> 45:59.730]  And just real important is the and zombies part of that.
[46:01.730 --> 46:03.890]  So we're bringing it back to the world ending.
[46:04.830 --> 46:06.330]  Pretty good stuff, man.
[46:06.530 --> 46:06.790]  Yeah.
[46:07.170 --> 46:07.790]  Way to go.
[46:09.090 --> 46:13.210]  But finally, it is time for my studio.
[46:15.330 --> 46:18.890]  Which means absolute best film studio winner.
[46:19.770 --> 46:25.290]  And I have Blair Witch Project, Cabin in the Woods, Jacob's Ladder, Alien, and The Shining.
[46:25.790 --> 46:28.570]  True isolationist horror classics.
[46:29.090 --> 46:33.690]  I think that this is spooky, scary, fun to watch by yourself or with friends.
[46:34.430 --> 46:35.910]  Definitely some good group watches.
[46:38.370 --> 46:39.350]  I don't know.
[46:39.550 --> 46:42.130]  There was a lot of excitement around the Cabin in the Woods when it came out,
[46:42.210 --> 46:45.330]  and it just didn't connect with me the way I wish it did.
[46:45.710 --> 46:48.790]  You know, you have to have the ones...
[46:48.790 --> 46:51.170]  See, when you're thinking of a box set of five,
[46:51.290 --> 46:54.450]  you have to have the heavy hitter like Alien and The Shining.
[46:54.790 --> 46:56.150]  That's going to bring the crowds in.
[46:56.410 --> 46:57.990]  You're going to have the old classics like Blair Witch.
[46:58.290 --> 47:02.130]  Cabin in the Woods and Jacob's Ladder are two where people,
[47:02.130 --> 47:04.310]  like Gavin had talked about earlier, like scanners,
[47:04.970 --> 47:07.370]  it's ones people know about, but maybe they haven't seen.
[47:07.730 --> 47:10.690]  And I feel like Cabin in the Woods is having a weird resurgence online right now,
[47:10.770 --> 47:12.010]  and Jacob's Ladder is next.
[47:12.290 --> 47:12.650]  That one's definitely...
[47:12.650 --> 47:15.270]  Jacob's Ladder is very cerebral too.
[47:15.390 --> 47:17.630]  It's good to have that one to make you think.
[47:17.850 --> 47:18.670]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:18.730 --> 47:19.990]  I feel really good about...
[47:19.990 --> 47:22.850]  I feel honestly really good about everyone's picks.
[47:22.930 --> 47:24.250]  I feel great about my five.
[47:25.130 --> 47:26.330]  I feel pretty fine, actually.
[47:26.650 --> 47:27.670]  I feel very confident.
[47:27.910 --> 47:28.070]  Yeah.
[47:28.190 --> 47:28.510]  Good.
[47:28.850 --> 47:30.390]  Well, it'll be exciting to see.
[47:30.390 --> 47:37.210]  We'll do a poll on the Patreon to determine the order in which these box sets would be popular.
[47:37.770 --> 47:38.610]  Popularity poll.
[47:39.550 --> 47:40.310]  I think we're good.
[47:40.410 --> 47:40.970]  I think we...
[47:40.970 --> 47:42.230]  This is a great auction, guys.
[47:42.830 --> 47:45.550]  I'm excited to see where our studios go from here.
[47:46.230 --> 47:49.370]  It would be interesting to add the movies as they rank on IMDB
[47:49.910 --> 47:51.330]  and see who has the lowest number.
[47:52.050 --> 47:53.010]  Oh, interesting.
[47:53.410 --> 47:54.470]  Oh, interesting.
[47:54.470 --> 47:57.530]  Yeah, I think Anaconda is probably hurting me.
[47:57.530 --> 47:58.830]  On that consideration.
[47:59.970 --> 48:03.190]  I don't think Scanners is helping Gavin either, honestly.
[48:03.330 --> 48:04.810]  No, no, no.
[48:05.410 --> 48:06.930]  But yeah, a little bit of intrigue around it.
[48:07.310 --> 48:08.170]  Yeah, that's fun.
[48:09.030 --> 48:09.890]  Great work, Andrew.
[48:10.050 --> 48:11.390]  This was a really good idea.
[48:11.830 --> 48:12.430]  Yeah, this was awesome.
[48:13.430 --> 48:17.490]  It's surprising that I think I'm the only one with what is technically a bad movie.
[48:17.790 --> 48:19.190]  Like, I think Anaconda is a lot of fun.
[48:20.010 --> 48:21.870]  Everything else on this list, I think are...
[48:21.870 --> 48:22.730]  Oh, I haven't seen Scanners.
[48:23.590 --> 48:24.930]  Sounds like Scanners might be bad.
[48:25.010 --> 48:25.370]  Never mind.
[48:25.570 --> 48:26.590]  I think it's very dated.
[48:26.590 --> 48:27.770]  Oh, is it dated?
[48:28.030 --> 48:29.270]  Scanners has one moment.
[48:29.730 --> 48:30.350]  You know what I mean?
[48:30.830 --> 48:31.050]  Yeah.
[48:31.150 --> 48:32.510]  And I've seen that moment.
[48:32.590 --> 48:32.810]  Yeah.
[48:32.830 --> 48:33.430]  As we all have.
[48:33.690 --> 48:34.150]  Cool effect.
[48:34.610 --> 48:35.530]  Very cool effect.
[48:36.170 --> 48:38.310]  But thank you so much for listening.
[48:38.830 --> 48:40.310]  Make sure you check out our Patreon.
[48:40.810 --> 48:42.410]  Maybe this is on Patreon only.
[48:42.670 --> 48:43.170]  Who knows?
[48:43.670 --> 48:44.550]  We'll schedule it later.
[48:44.770 --> 48:47.230]  But if not, check out our Patreon at the Regulation Pod.
[48:47.550 --> 48:48.650]  Regulatrion.com
[48:48.650 --> 48:49.530]  We've got a podcast.
[48:49.790 --> 48:50.410]  Check that out.
[48:51.210 --> 48:53.310]  I think I'm happy.
[48:53.730 --> 48:54.490]  Can I just clarify?
[48:54.830 --> 48:55.210]  Yeah.
[48:55.210 --> 48:57.650]  Are the films listed in order that we bought them?
[48:58.270 --> 48:58.670]  Yes.
[48:59.350 --> 49:03.330]  I just love the idea of Geoff's listing Evil Dead 2 and then Evil Dead Around.
[49:06.190 --> 49:08.030]  Oh, I had to jump on it when it got brought up.
[49:08.310 --> 49:08.710]  Gotta be.
[49:08.730 --> 49:11.210]  He had to ensure that he got the one for the set.
[49:11.390 --> 49:11.590]  Yep.
[49:12.670 --> 49:13.170]  All right.
[49:13.210 --> 49:14.010]  We'll see you guys next time.
[49:14.290 --> 49:14.690]  Bye.
[49:14.830 --> 49:15.170]  Bye.
