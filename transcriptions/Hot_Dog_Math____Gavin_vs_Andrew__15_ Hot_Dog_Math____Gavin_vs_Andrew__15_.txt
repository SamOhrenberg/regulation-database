[00:00.000 --> 00:03.580]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[00:03.920 --> 00:06.820]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[00:06.900 --> 00:10.520]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[00:10.940 --> 00:14.740]  Available for a limited time. Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[00:22.120 --> 00:26.700]  Hello and welcome to The Regulation Podcast. It is episode 15.
[00:26.700 --> 00:32.840]  I am joined, as always, by Jeff Ramsey, Gavin Free, Nick Schwartz, and Eric Baddour.
[00:33.040 --> 00:34.140]  Hello. How's everybody doing?
[00:34.780 --> 00:37.780]  That was a great intro, Andrew. I'm doing much better now.
[00:37.900 --> 00:39.520]  You caught me in my vocal exercises.
[00:39.680 --> 00:44.380]  Yeah, you inspired me with the vocal exercise. Everybody quiet. Eric needs the floor.
[00:45.420 --> 00:47.880]  Andrew, how many hot dogs does the moon weigh?
[00:48.420 --> 00:51.880]  Oh, you immediately, you thought, once again, you're trying to catch me in a Gavin move.
[00:52.000 --> 00:55.640]  I'm not trying to get you. This is the first thing. I have notes from last time.
[00:55.640 --> 00:57.740]  That is what's going on here.
[00:57.760 --> 01:00.680]  Fair enough. We typically do it before we record, and we didn't do it that time.
[01:00.720 --> 01:04.340]  That's fair. I believe that. I got it, Eric. I got the hot dog math.
[01:05.100 --> 01:10.900]  Let me put it in the chat right here. I screenshot it. I did my due diligence.
[01:11.120 --> 01:14.300]  I counted. I rounded. I analyzed some dogs. Corn dogs.
[01:14.360 --> 01:15.720]  You counted and rounded.
[01:16.380 --> 01:24.680]  We did all the math. Here is my hot dog math. You can tell me, Gavin, over or under
[01:25.640 --> 01:26.620]  my overall thing.
[01:27.160 --> 01:28.780]  Oh, I have to remember the... oh, okay.
[01:29.080 --> 01:31.420]  Yeah, well, you're the hot dog moon guy, so...
[01:31.420 --> 01:32.460]  What the fuck?
[01:34.040 --> 01:35.220]  Also, it says sogs.
[01:36.580 --> 01:43.900]  40 dogs is 5 pounds. 400 dogs is 50 pounds. 4000 dogs is 500 pounds.
[01:44.180 --> 01:48.240]  40,000 dogs is 5,000 pounds. 400... it's a lot.
[01:48.580 --> 01:53.980]  I ended up with 5 quadrillion pounds of dog.
[01:54.440 --> 01:55.500]  Way low, I think.
[01:55.640 --> 01:56.480]  I'm pretty sure of it.
[01:56.500 --> 02:01.000]  Oh, okay. I'll go back in the lab. I'm gonna keep on this.
[02:02.100 --> 02:06.740]  How... why is... okay, you've written sogs. You've underlined one of the results.
[02:08.300 --> 02:09.640]  I don't know how I did that.
[02:10.680 --> 02:16.460]  I want to see... can I see some of your work from school and how it was marked?
[02:17.140 --> 02:18.300]  I guess you were homeschooled, right?
[02:19.280 --> 02:22.560]  No, listen, I'm sure I got some elementary reports around. I can find them.
[02:23.600 --> 02:26.220]  Do you have a specific subject you'd like to see?
[02:26.700 --> 02:27.520]  Math. Math.
[02:27.800 --> 02:33.040]  See, I always hated math because I had to show the work and I just thought that was dumb.
[02:33.500 --> 02:37.040]  This is wasting everybody's time. Just let me put the number down. If the number's right,
[02:37.360 --> 02:41.680]  just accept it. Just be happy with it. Why do we got to show all this research?
[02:42.040 --> 02:45.420]  That's a good point, Andrew. It's not like you had to show how you read the word.
[02:46.040 --> 02:50.600]  You know, it's like first I started with the letter M and I read that as M in my head and
[02:50.600 --> 02:55.940]  I said, ah, and then so I put in that and then I added a T and an H, which made a different sound
[02:55.940 --> 03:00.760]  than just a T. So it was like, so I put it all together with math. Like, we don't do that.
[03:01.060 --> 03:06.020]  No. And I get the idea being you're establishing that you understand the concepts correctly,
[03:06.020 --> 03:11.920]  but I just felt like we're wasting everybody's time. Why am I showing this? Just take the number.
[03:13.200 --> 03:13.860]  Uh, wrong.
[03:14.380 --> 03:15.060]  What's wrong?
[03:15.600 --> 03:15.940]  The number.
[03:16.820 --> 03:20.300]  What? Oh, yeah, my number's wrong. Yeah, yeah. Number back in third grade.
[03:20.800 --> 03:22.780]  Fucking nailed it. Number was right.
[03:23.140 --> 03:26.540]  Immediately. What was wrong? What you did? Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[03:27.060 --> 03:30.980]  I remember this being a big issue with division, especially. I was ahead of the curve when it
[03:30.980 --> 03:35.000]  came to division of fourth grade. I was top of my class when it came to getting the concept
[03:35.000 --> 03:35.800]  of division.
[03:36.020 --> 03:37.540]  You've been dividing since third grade?
[03:38.040 --> 03:42.120]  You know, listen, it's just fourth grade was when we were learned. We were taught division.
[03:43.680 --> 03:47.740]  And I just, I don't know, it came natural to me. I was really good at it.
[03:48.600 --> 03:52.780]  And it used to annoy me that I would finish ahead of everybody else, but I'd still have to
[03:52.780 --> 03:56.700]  show the work every time. Just let me put the number down. It's not hard.
[03:57.100 --> 04:00.440]  But surely sometimes you did need to write it out to figure it out.
[04:00.860 --> 04:05.840]  I mean, it was really basic division in grade four. So now some of it was just like you just
[04:05.840 --> 04:10.580]  do it in your head. Why am I having to write out this basic equation? We're wasting ink,
[04:10.680 --> 04:11.820]  we're wasting paper. What are we doing?
[04:12.160 --> 04:16.600]  This has reminded me of a moment from school when I was in maths and I was sat next to my
[04:16.600 --> 04:22.400]  friend and we had to plot some stuff on a graph. And to do that, we had to pick some like arbitrary
[04:22.780 --> 04:29.520]  thing. Like I think I picked like Jimmy ran 10 meters in 500 seconds or whatever.
[04:29.740 --> 04:34.540]  And my friend was like, he was struggling to pick something. So he called the teacher over.
[04:34.580 --> 04:37.400]  He's like, I don't really know what to do. And the teacher's like, well,
[04:38.440 --> 04:42.780]  what do you, what do you think you want to put as that? And he said, well, I don't care really.
[04:42.780 --> 04:47.780]  As if to say, I don't mind. And the teacher went, well, you should care and sent him out.
[04:48.380 --> 04:52.900]  He was gone for the rest of the lesson. And I was so unjust.
[04:56.380 --> 05:00.400]  He just kicked off for no reason. Do you think he still thinks about that?
[05:00.800 --> 05:06.220]  No, I bet. I bet he doesn't. I would also be sitting next to him and then I would
[05:06.900 --> 05:11.620]  suddenly like hear what sounded like someone pouring water on a book. And it was, he used to
[05:11.620 --> 05:20.920]  nosebleeds all the time. Just suddenly so much blood. I love unlocking a memory. I haven't
[05:20.920 --> 05:25.860]  thought about that in probably two decades. Oh, that's great. I had that with Josh Hartnett movies
[05:25.860 --> 05:30.540]  today. I was doing a thing where I had to remember Josh Hartnett movies.
[05:30.960 --> 05:35.960]  And they gave you a nosebleed? No, it just didn't unlock Josh Hartnett memories. I didn't know I
[05:35.960 --> 05:41.400]  had. I forgot the Black Dahlia movie was a thing. I was really struggling to think of a Josh Hartnett
[05:41.400 --> 05:48.880]  one word movie. Trap! Yeah, I put in trapped and I was so fucking mad. It was what prevented me from
[05:48.880 --> 05:55.200]  a perfect game. I put in trapped instead of trap. I felt like an idiot. Real dumb. But it did,
[05:55.300 --> 06:01.980]  it brought me, I laughed really hard at, I never thought about how funny Halloween H2O's title is
[06:01.980 --> 06:08.960]  because I've never like seen it written out fully. Like it is so clearly like they had an argument
[06:08.960 --> 06:15.320]  of what it should be called. And it's just to look at Halloween, the title, the full title,
[06:15.600 --> 06:22.020]  Halloween H2O in brackets 20 years later. They're like, somebody was like, nobody's going to get
[06:22.020 --> 06:25.840]  what H2O means. They're going to think it's water. They're not going to get this 20 years
[06:25.840 --> 06:31.260]  after the first one. We have to really elaborate. It is so unnecessary how large that title is.
[06:31.580 --> 06:36.720]  Does water come into the plot? Uh, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. Not that I
[06:37.180 --> 06:45.620]  remember. Because the whole title is Halloween H2O colon 20 years later. Yes. So no,
[06:45.900 --> 06:48.340]  didn't have anything to do with it. Why didn't they just call it H20?
[06:50.500 --> 06:54.960]  I don't, what I, then I think it sort of loses the punch of H2O, don't you think?
[06:55.740 --> 07:01.080]  Well, H2O is completely irrelevant. Right. That's, I think we might be saying the same thing.
[07:02.640 --> 07:09.560]  I, I agree with you. All right. It's a bad title. Can you name another Josh Hartnett single word
[07:09.560 --> 07:15.400]  title outside of trap? Couldn't do it. I felt like I was going deep. I was going, nah, it's two words.
[07:17.520 --> 07:23.120]  Oh, Oppenheimer. Duh. I didn't see Oppenheimer. So that, that, I missed that one. That was,
[07:23.200 --> 07:27.940]  that was the top answer. Hey, you're pretty good at this, Eric. You're going to become my
[07:27.940 --> 07:33.020]  phone-a-friend now. What I, I was just thinking about what I saw with a minute, you know,
[07:33.400 --> 07:40.900]  just don't, you know, did you see trap? Did you watch it or no? No. Okay. Is it out? Yeah. I wasn't
[07:40.900 --> 07:45.800]  sure if it came out yet. I guess it came out on Friday, didn't it? I think it was either last week
[07:45.800 --> 07:51.060]  or this week. Two weeks ago? Came out two weeks ago? At the time of this recording, it might,
[07:51.080 --> 07:55.920]  it might have been out of two weeks ago. Maybe. Wow. That movie made no money then. I didn't,
[07:55.920 --> 08:03.180]  nobody's talking about trap. I really wanted it too. I was mad when you got it as low as you did.
[08:03.220 --> 08:06.620]  I was like, I thought this would go higher. I mean, I just saw trap. That's why, I mean,
[08:06.640 --> 08:12.080]  that's why I got trap. Oh, you watched it? Yeah. Can I, I have two. Oh my God. What's this
[08:12.080 --> 08:16.840]  conversation about? I don't, I trap apparently. I don't know what happened. What do you mean?
[08:17.300 --> 08:22.480]  What is what? Elaborate, Gavin. What are you confused about? Well, didn't you already know
[08:22.480 --> 08:26.780]  he'd seen it? Didn't he just say that? Well, I, I wasn't sure if he was kidding. I was just
[08:26.780 --> 08:33.600]  confirming. Yeah. I'm kind of like, I'm like the, I'm like the original prankster of this podcast.
[08:33.740 --> 08:37.700]  I'm like telling you guys I saw trap. No, let me clarify. It's like when somebody says I haven't
[08:37.700 --> 08:42.060]  seen the Godfather and then they go, you haven't seen the Godfather? Like it's just, it's a natural,
[08:42.100 --> 08:46.420]  I was surprised because I know Eric hates M. Night Shyamalan. No, he's not an M. Night guy.
[08:47.060 --> 08:51.780]  So hate, hate, hate's a strong word, but I might feel it more strongly after watching trap. See,
[08:51.780 --> 08:57.240]  that might be on me. That's how I felt you felt about him. So I just, that caught me off guard.
[08:57.300 --> 09:01.880]  So I was like, Oh, what? Really? You saw that? I have two questions. Yeah. Two questions about
[09:01.880 --> 09:07.420]  trap. Spoilers for anybody that cares about trap. I'm curious about the twist. Okay. When I saw the
[09:07.420 --> 09:14.060]  trailer, I had a thought. I had two thoughts. One, does it turn out that he is not the intended
[09:14.060 --> 09:20.600]  killer that they're trying to trap? No. Okay. Well, nevermind. That was, dang, I was really
[09:20.600 --> 09:26.040]  betting on that. I thought I cracked the code when I watched that trailer. I was like, I think
[09:26.040 --> 09:30.760]  it's the guy that he's got in his basement. Yeah. That, that's what everyone said. They're like,
[09:30.820 --> 09:36.540]  Oh, I bet it's like his daughter. No, it's him the whole time. Is he a ghost? Nope. Nope. Must
[09:36.540 --> 09:44.080]  be out. Is he a robot? Is he a lady in a lake? Nope. Is he an alien? It really like doesn't have
[09:44.080 --> 09:51.240]  a twist. Oh, is he a plant? That's the twist. It is. I mean, I'll, I'll tell, I'm not going to like
[09:51.240 --> 09:56.360]  spoil the whole thing or whatever. The first two thirds of that movie are stellar. They are so good.
[09:56.480 --> 10:03.220]  I was like gripped. Edge of my seat was like out loud going like, Holy shit. I really like this
[10:03.220 --> 10:14.020]  movie. There is something that happens two thirds of the way through that movie. Like at the
[10:14.020 --> 10:20.120]  movie to people. I can't wait to watch it now. So do you think if I left two thirds of the way in,
[10:20.220 --> 10:25.300]  would I come away thinking, man, that was good? I would. And, and you would go like, man, I wonder
[10:25.300 --> 10:32.480]  what happens. It's what happens sucks so much shit. And it's fucking stupid in a way that makes
[10:32.480 --> 10:38.580]  you go, what was the point of this? It's such a bummer. Cause I love the premise and Josh Hartnett
[10:38.580 --> 10:45.580]  is so good. And it just falls off a cliff. It's stunning. It's staggering. It's like, you just go,
[10:45.760 --> 10:50.440]  I've never been tricked by another human being on earth more than M Night Shyamalan.
[10:53.480 --> 10:59.280]  But not the way he wants to trick you. No, no. In a way where I go, dude, this might be the one
[10:59.280 --> 11:02.460]  and you watch it. You go, Holy shit, dude, he did it. And then you keep watching it and you go
[11:02.460 --> 11:09.060]  this motherfucker did it again. And then you like, you'll watch a movie, like the visit begrudgingly.
[11:09.080 --> 11:12.320]  Cause you're like, I'm not falling for another M Night Shyamalan movie. He's done this to me
[11:12.320 --> 11:17.660]  before. And then you watch it and it's fucking awesome. Start to finish and you go, Oh, he's back.
[11:18.180 --> 11:25.640]  That's a great movie. That's a great movie. He tricks people like the stuff with like the visit
[11:25.640 --> 11:31.360]  where it's like, man, he did this for like no money. Pretty cool, dude. I think you're in that
[11:31.360 --> 11:37.040]  village, Jeff. I think you're getting tricked by the world around you. The village was not a good
[11:37.040 --> 11:41.680]  movie. I know. I saw it in the theater. The visit was a good movie. Oh, I see. I was here in the
[11:41.680 --> 11:45.620]  village. That was sick. No, I don't give a shit about the village where the enemy was a hole in
[11:45.620 --> 11:50.240]  the ground. No, the visit was about a girl who goes to visit her grandmother and grandfather.
[11:50.820 --> 11:55.120]  What about, what about the happening? You guys big happening heads? I never saw it.
[11:56.820 --> 12:01.120]  It's weird. It's a weird watch. I watched it recently, probably like four months ago.
[12:01.120 --> 12:08.280]  It has the it has the funniest scene in it where Mark Wahlberg negotiates with a house plant and
[12:08.280 --> 12:14.700]  then he goes up to it and then touches it. He goes, oh, fake. It's a fake house plant. And you go,
[12:14.760 --> 12:19.080]  what are we doing with our time? This is a waste of my time. That's the one where they had the
[12:19.080 --> 12:26.420]  meme where he goes, what? No. Yeah. Yes, yes, yes. Increasingly slowed down every time. I've
[12:26.420 --> 12:29.960]  seen that one million times. I've never seen a second of the movie, though. Yeah. What's
[12:29.960 --> 12:37.760]  interesting about that is it it is all on Mark Wahlberg because I watch signs and then I or I
[12:37.760 --> 12:44.300]  watched the happening and then I watch signs and signs has so many identical shots to the happening
[12:44.300 --> 12:48.120]  where it just feels uncomfortable and the camera's kind of floating while the character looks
[12:48.120 --> 12:53.960]  absently. And it works with Mel Gibson and it does not translate at all with Mark Wahlberg.
[12:54.120 --> 12:59.500]  Mark Wahlberg. It just comes off very awkward and dumb where there's something with Mel Gibson
[12:59.500 --> 13:04.220]  where it feels more like this character is puzzled and or troubled by what is happening.
[13:05.400 --> 13:11.100]  Nick takes about science. Signs is a good movie and it's enjoyable until you really think about
[13:11.100 --> 13:17.280]  what the weakness of the aliens is being water. And they came to a planet that's mostly water.
[13:17.540 --> 13:21.560]  That's like 90 percent water. Right. I know we all mocked them for that. Imagine how
[13:21.560 --> 13:25.680]  embarrassed they were when they realized that they clearly didn't know.
[13:26.720 --> 13:31.340]  It's a good point. Can you imagine if they walked by the the party and it was raining during the
[13:31.340 --> 13:37.000]  party? It's like, well, move over. It's like when you go to the doctor to get a procedure and they
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.620]  go, are you allergic to penicillin? And you go, let's find out. I don't know. Maybe aliens were
[13:41.620 --> 13:46.200]  like, what do you think that blue shit is? I don't know. Let's find out. Don't like it. Don't like
[13:46.200 --> 13:52.140]  it. I would like to imagine it was like Interstellar where they shot like pods to like 15 planets to
[13:52.140 --> 13:57.780]  determine the best one. And there's just one guy they blame. They're just like, fuck. Roy did not.
[13:58.380 --> 14:05.820]  Oh, the scanner. Roy, you're bullshit. We all died. Also, it doesn't matter what they do in that
[14:05.820 --> 14:10.980]  fucking cornfield town that they live in to fight those aliens back. They're just going to all hang
[14:10.980 --> 14:15.620]  out in the desert in like numbers of billions. And we'll just never be able to go to the desert again.
[14:16.180 --> 14:22.880]  That's a great point. Yeah. You think that Super Soakers had an increase in sales after that movie
[14:22.880 --> 14:28.000]  came out? If the movie had been better, I bet they would have. A lot of people saw it. People like
[14:28.000 --> 14:34.460]  Science. Yeah, they love it. Science is a liked movie. It's a well-received film. It was a decently
[14:34.460 --> 14:39.680]  received film. I think if we looked at it critically, I think people liked it at the time. Didn't War of
[14:39.680 --> 14:46.500]  the Worlds also have aliens that couldn't live on Earth? Yes. Yeah. Because of germs. Yeah, germs
[14:46.500 --> 14:52.900]  killed the aliens in that one. It's the same thing that happens to me when I go to Austin. I relate
[14:52.900 --> 15:01.920]  to the aliens. I'm not acclimated for all these sick people. Man, while we're talking about movies,
[15:02.300 --> 15:07.580]  I have a bit of an embarrassing... one of the more embarrassing things that's happened to me
[15:09.280 --> 15:13.420]  in my memory, unfortunately, happened to me the other day at a movie.
[15:14.720 --> 15:20.720]  I took Millie. We went and saw Deadpool versus Wolverine. Or Deadpool and Wolverine? I don't
[15:20.720 --> 15:25.260]  even know what the movie's called. Deadpool, Wolverine. Which is, by the way, a pretty good
[15:25.260 --> 15:30.120]  movie. I enjoyed it up until the part where I couldn't pay attention to the movie anymore because
[15:30.120 --> 15:40.440]  I had my head in my hands for 90 minutes. What happened? Well, Millie and I went. I booked the
[15:40.440 --> 15:47.180]  tickets late, so they only had two seats in the second row in the middle. So we were right up on
[15:47.180 --> 15:51.440]  it, which is fine, except it's a big theater at Alamo, isn't it, Mueller? And so there's a bunch
[15:51.440 --> 15:58.840]  of rows behind us. And we were an hour in. And it's been hot lately, so I've been thirsty. And
[15:58.840 --> 16:03.040]  I ordered a Diet Coke. And if you get the Alamo Drafthouse, for people who aren't familiar with
[16:03.040 --> 16:08.360]  the Alamo Drafthouse, you get a soda that's somewhere larger than a plastic Pizza Hut cup,
[16:08.480 --> 16:15.980]  but smaller than a Gerpler. It's 20-plus ounces of soda will come at you in this plastic cup,
[16:16.080 --> 16:20.720]  though. And so I downed one, knowing I'd probably have to piss three times in the movie. But I
[16:20.720 --> 16:24.680]  didn't care. I was so thirsty. And then I decided I wanted more. And so I got a refill because,
[16:24.800 --> 16:28.480]  hey, you can do that at the Alamo Drafthouse. And the guy came and he dropped my soda off. And I'm
[16:28.480 --> 16:33.540]  sitting there watching the movie. And you know the part where they go underground and he meets,
[16:33.660 --> 16:37.880]  I don't want to spoil this movie for anybody, but he meets the other cast of characters on that
[16:38.660 --> 16:43.600]  desolate planet. And they start to introduce each other. Well, right about when that happens,
[16:43.740 --> 16:49.800]  when he's meeting the one dude that wears sunglasses, I set my drink, I took a drink,
[16:49.900 --> 16:55.380]  a sip of my drink with a straw, and I set it down on the table in front of me,
[16:56.440 --> 17:05.120]  flat. But for some reason, it turned to the right and started to tip. And as loud as I've
[17:05.120 --> 17:10.240]  ever said anything in my entire life, because it was pure reaction, I said, oh, no, no, no, no, no,
[17:10.320 --> 17:17.940]  no, no. And I tried to grab it with my right hand because it had just set it down. And instead,
[17:18.100 --> 17:24.720]  I punched it into my neighbor's lap. And it was full. And it was a guy sitting next to me in a
[17:24.720 --> 17:31.060]  pair of shorts, an adult man on a date with his wife or a girlfriend with just a pair of khaki
[17:31.060 --> 17:41.480]  shorts on. And I dumped somewhere between 20 and 30 ounces of water, 20 to 30 ounces of Diet Coke
[17:41.480 --> 17:47.340]  directly into his lap. And then the cup bounced off his dick and hit the ground.
[17:51.080 --> 18:01.820]  And the entire theater went, oh, not because of the movie. And then Millie goes, oh. And then
[18:01.820 --> 18:08.160]  she started laughing as loud as a human being can laugh. And she did it for 10 straight minutes.
[18:08.400 --> 18:14.140]  And I looked at the guy and he looked at me and I just had some napkins and I put them in his lap.
[18:14.140 --> 18:19.580]  And then I realized I was trying to sop up a guy's dick with napkins. And I'm like, here. And I
[18:19.580 --> 18:23.860]  just pushed him in his hand and he's like, I got it. And then I'm like, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I
[18:23.860 --> 18:27.180]  don't know what happened. I'm so, so sorry. And I'm just speaking at full volume because what else
[18:27.180 --> 18:31.060]  are you going to do? Like the whole theater stops to let us have this exchange. No, nothing's
[18:31.060 --> 18:35.520]  happening on the screen anyway. It doesn't matter. And so I've got like 180 people watching this
[18:35.520 --> 18:39.640]  conversation and I'm like, I'm so fucking sorry. Please let me buy your dinner. Let me buy your
[18:39.640 --> 18:42.980]  drinks. Can I buy you a beer or something? Let me pay for your tickets. And he's like, nah, man,
[18:42.980 --> 18:48.400]  it's okay. And he's trying to be nice about it, but he's sitting in a puddle on those leather
[18:48.400 --> 18:54.020]  seats or those faux leather seats. How much of the movie is left at this point? 90 minutes.
[18:56.380 --> 19:00.880]  I just love the idea of him like eventually reclining his seat and he's here like a shit
[19:00.880 --> 19:06.380]  load of liquid, like a waterfall coming off the back. He never did. I just gave him all my napkins
[19:06.380 --> 19:10.300]  and I apologized profusely and he smiled and his wife said it was okay and they were nice.
[19:10.300 --> 19:18.280]  And then I just put my head in my hands for the next 90 minutes. I listened to most of the movie.
[19:18.440 --> 19:23.480]  I watched a little bit of it every once in a while I'd look up, but mostly I just like sat there with
[19:23.480 --> 19:29.460]  my head in my hands horrified. And then I thought like, I can't leave before him. I have to have a
[19:29.460 --> 19:34.100]  conversation with him after. I have to make another opportunity to buy his tickets or pay for his
[19:34.100 --> 19:41.100]  dinner or pay for dry cleaning or something, you know, like I don't know. And that motherfucker
[19:41.100 --> 19:45.860]  and his wife, they're the kind of people that sit through the credits. And I had to pee so
[19:45.860 --> 19:51.500]  fucking badly and Millie had to pee so badly and we just sat there through the entire credits with
[19:51.500 --> 19:55.780]  the lights on at that point because they were watching him and having a conversation. And then
[19:55.780 --> 20:00.020]  when it was finally done and then they had the post-credits scene, I was able to turn to him and
[20:00.020 --> 20:06.120]  apologize again. And he was lovely and very nice and he was dry at that point. And I just got the
[20:06.120 --> 20:13.100]  fuck out of there, but I'm never going to a movie again. Oh, man. Yeah, you got to figure I don't.
[20:13.940 --> 20:19.940]  What did you put the drink on? Just the table, man. I don't know what it hit a pencil or an ice
[20:19.940 --> 20:24.860]  cube. I wasn't aware of or I just or I'm just stupid because I was watching a movie and putting
[20:24.860 --> 20:29.920]  a drink down at the same time. Regardless, however I did it, it tipped and I punched it
[20:29.920 --> 20:37.200]  into his lap just like right into it. Like you couldn't have like you couldn't have done it more
[20:37.200 --> 20:42.760]  offensively. Like I really love I want people to go back and listen to the way you describe putting
[20:42.760 --> 20:51.540]  a drink down where you tried to get all of your guiltiness off of you. I put down a soda the
[20:52.260 --> 20:58.740]  flat style, regular, normal on a flat surface and nothing was weird and it was normal and regular.
[20:58.980 --> 21:06.600]  And then something happened. And then a gentle ghost came in and spilled the drink.
[21:07.660 --> 21:13.980]  It's clearly I fucked up somehow. I just don't know how I how what I don't know what I hit or
[21:13.980 --> 21:18.640]  how I put it down wrong that made it do that. But it was definitely me who punched it into his lap
[21:18.640 --> 21:22.620]  trying to recover and going, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[21:22.840 --> 21:30.640]  Like that fucking full volume. I think you need to be a Camelback drink guy at the show to avoid
[21:30.640 --> 21:37.840]  that in the future. I think you just got to I agree with Andrew and you should start being a
[21:37.840 --> 21:43.060]  Camelback drink guy immediately. The thing that scares me about this, I'm not going to do that.
[21:43.160 --> 21:46.620]  But the thing that scares me about this is I've been doing shit in twos lately. Like when I shit
[21:46.620 --> 21:51.460]  my pants last time, I shit my pants twice. When I pulled the the fucking thing out of the out of
[21:51.460 --> 21:56.900]  the gas pump, I did it twice. So I'm just going to avoid going to the movies for a long time from
[21:56.900 --> 22:00.580]  here on out because I'm so scared I'm gonna do it again to somebody. You should actually have to
[22:00.580 --> 22:06.880]  legally wear that Camelback. It's like a it's it's a bright community service. Yeah, like a warning.
[22:06.880 --> 22:11.380]  Like you're you're sitting next to a guy that doesn't know how to put a drink down. It'd be
[22:11.380 --> 22:19.000]  like a beacon in a dark theater. I as a forty nine year old man wanted to cry in public
[22:19.820 --> 22:26.620]  because I felt embarrassed and bad that I had inconvenienced a complete fucking stranger and
[22:26.620 --> 22:31.520]  his wife who were clearly on a date. And I don't know what was supposed to happen after the movie,
[22:31.520 --> 22:41.960]  but a clothes change was now involved. And I just feel like such an asshole, such an asshole.
[22:42.340 --> 22:49.740]  It's just it's unpleasant being sticky and to have to be sticky when it's not your fault.
[22:49.980 --> 22:55.340]  And to have to be sticky when it's not your fault for so long. Like if I had done it to him in the
[22:55.340 --> 23:01.720]  last act, you know, like 15 minutes ago, you're like, oh, that sucks. But we were like there was
[23:01.720 --> 23:07.060]  most of the movie left. It was a two and a half hour movie and we were like an hour in maybe.
[23:07.520 --> 23:10.300]  I'm going to be honest. If I was Millie, I probably would have just left you.
[23:10.760 --> 23:14.100]  I would have just walked out, I think. Yeah, I couldn't handle it.
[23:14.180 --> 23:17.280]  I feel like I would have I would have walked out if I was Jeff. I would have been like,
[23:17.280 --> 23:19.540]  oh, let me go get you some napkins. And I never would have come back.
[23:23.720 --> 23:26.620]  I can't do that. I would have gone to my grave.
[23:29.640 --> 23:35.120]  Millie laughing for like 10 minutes straight, just to me, if there was any doubt proves that
[23:35.120 --> 23:37.980]  she is your daughter and there's no two ways about it.
[23:38.340 --> 23:42.160]  Oh, yeah, no, it was the it was the highlight of her week for sure.
[23:42.600 --> 23:48.520]  Could you imagine if you went to a movie, you and Gavin and Gavin did what you are describing,
[23:48.520 --> 23:52.140]  you would have not stopped laughing through the entire film, Jeff.
[23:52.240 --> 23:55.120]  I would have stood up and pointed at him while I laughed. Are you kidding?
[23:56.880 --> 24:02.180]  Oh, my God. He better hope that never fucking happens around me because I will make it the
[24:02.180 --> 24:06.980]  worst day of his life already. It already is. And I'm just going to I'm going to triple down on that.
[24:07.060 --> 24:10.600]  Yeah, no, there's no way I deserve all I deserve all of the Millie laughter.
[24:10.640 --> 24:12.600]  And I don't blame her. I would have done the same thing to her.
[24:13.180 --> 24:16.900]  I like that there were three people in that movie theater not watching the movie for different
[24:16.900 --> 24:25.380]  reasons. This episode is brought to you by State Farm. Checking off the boxes on your to-do list
[24:25.380 --> 24:30.700]  is a great feeling. And when it comes to checking off coverage, a State Farm agent can help you
[24:30.700 --> 24:35.280]  choose an option that's right for you. Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone or
[24:35.280 --> 24:40.000]  using the award winning app, it's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits
[24:40.000 --> 24:48.080]  your needs. Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there. Hey, it's Paris. You know,
[24:48.080 --> 24:53.880]  I love sparkly things, right? Like stars. Duh. And thanks to Hilton and Auto Camp,
[24:54.040 --> 25:00.700]  I just slept under them. Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious airstream,
[25:01.180 --> 25:07.540]  making s'mores with the kids while a national park is our backdrop. The great outdoors meets
[25:07.540 --> 25:15.120]  Hilton hospitality. That's hot. Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com. Hilton for the stay.
[25:15.680 --> 25:19.380]  Well, are you saying you're not going to go see Borderlands? Since you're on a movie break,
[25:19.460 --> 25:23.140]  you're going to miss out on Borderlands. I think I might miss out on Borderlands. Opening at zero
[25:23.140 --> 25:28.380]  percent, I think is now three percent on raw domains. Last time I checked. How many movies
[25:28.380 --> 25:35.280]  open at zero percent? Not many. I think maybe just this one. It might just be this. Eric and I
[25:35.280 --> 25:40.280]  were talking about it yesterday. I kind of want to do a supplemental piece. Have we all played
[25:40.280 --> 25:45.460]  Borderlands? Yeah. No. Yeah. You never played it, Gavin? That's interesting. I think I played
[25:45.460 --> 25:50.540]  it once. Didn't we do a playthrough at Achievement Hunter that was all melee, no weapons? Were you
[25:50.540 --> 25:56.380]  not in that? No. Oh, OK. I feel like with the games, they're such an established of like,
[25:56.420 --> 26:00.660]  OK, if you're going to if you're going to turn this into a movie, what do you need to do?
[26:01.080 --> 26:05.960]  I think it would be fun if we did a supplemental that was like, we are regulation productions
[26:05.960 --> 26:11.440]  and we've been assigned to make a Borderlands movie. What are the things that we feel are
[26:12.220 --> 26:16.560]  musts if you're going to try to adapt this and then eventually watching the movie and seeing
[26:16.560 --> 26:21.020]  how many of those are actually in the film? We were talking about this. This is what I was saying
[26:21.020 --> 26:26.080]  when we were doing a gameplay earlier that Andrew had a great idea for a supplemental piece. Here's
[26:26.080 --> 26:31.160]  the way that I really see it going. We play the game for a little while. That's a gameplay.
[26:31.160 --> 26:40.300]  Then we do a draft of things that like, essentially like we're filling 50 or whatever
[26:40.300 --> 26:45.800]  empty slots of what we think need to be in a Borderlands movie. And then from that,
[26:46.000 --> 26:52.460]  we get randomly generated bingo cards. And then we watch the movie and play bingo on Borderlands,
[26:52.880 --> 26:59.100]  hoping that the things that we think need to be in the movie are in the Borderlands movie.
[26:59.100 --> 27:05.260]  That, that I think would be so fun. Maybe it's not even like making a bingo line. Maybe it's
[27:05.260 --> 27:10.240]  just like getting as many as you can. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It might be hard to come up
[27:10.240 --> 27:15.100]  with that many prompts that are good. This is a really interesting idea. This is a really
[27:15.100 --> 27:21.520]  interesting idea. I like this a lot. How do you think we could get enough of the story if we play
[27:21.520 --> 27:25.280]  it? I assume we'd have to play Borderlands 1 because that would be parody with the movie,
[27:25.280 --> 27:32.660]  I would assume. So do we have to do you think an hour of gameplay would be enough? For us? Yeah,
[27:32.700 --> 27:36.140]  maybe not Gavin because he hasn't played it, but I think we've all probably played multiple
[27:36.140 --> 27:41.380]  Borderlands outside of Gavin. Yeah. Have like a one hour refresher of the first game and then just
[27:41.380 --> 27:47.780]  be like, this is this is what they need to hit. I've like seven things in my head immediately
[27:47.780 --> 27:52.260]  when I started thinking about it. I'm like, oh, yeah, there you got to do certain things. And I
[27:52.260 --> 27:57.520]  am not convinced the movie did any of them. I'm trying to avoid as much info as possible about the
[27:57.520 --> 28:01.900]  movie until we do this, because I just think it would be a fun to go in as blind as I can.
[28:02.620 --> 28:06.440]  I played Tales from the Borderlands more than Borderlands. Yeah. Whose movie is that?
[28:07.180 --> 28:12.460]  That's a weird thing to answer because it was originally directed by Eli Roth,
[28:12.760 --> 28:19.620]  but then he got replaced by Tim Miller for the reshoots. But it's credited as an Eli Roth movie.
[28:20.180 --> 28:28.600]  Who's got it in our group? I'm I'm looking right now. Oh, fuck. Guys, guys, guys, I got an idea
[28:28.600 --> 28:34.600]  for a supplemental. We do a thing where we try to see who can see the movie the most times. Oh,
[28:34.600 --> 28:39.020]  shit. Yeah. With their own money. Deadpool Wolverine in honor of Jeff Spill.
[28:40.460 --> 28:47.040]  Guys, wouldn't it be so fun as a community to see who could do the regulation most times
[28:47.040 --> 28:54.220]  seeing the Borderlands movie? Who wants to be the regulation claptrap? Throw it up to the audience.
[28:55.900 --> 29:01.060]  While you're doing that, why don't you lasso up a seat for Horizon and American Saga part one?
[29:03.000 --> 29:06.540]  First, you got to lasso Horizon part one. Bring it back to the theaters.
[29:07.320 --> 29:11.960]  Oh, I'm sure it's in some theater somewhere. It's still playing in Oklahoma, I bet.
[29:12.560 --> 29:16.420]  Speaking of M. Night Shyamalan, this is another thing I brought up to Eric that he
[29:16.420 --> 29:22.780]  suggested I bring up here. What is a movie? You know, like when you are going to make a dinner
[29:22.780 --> 29:26.760]  you're excited about and like you prep everything and it's sort of like maybe fancier than you
[29:26.760 --> 29:31.800]  normally would, you go all out and then you fucking burn it. And it's just like this is ruined. Like
[29:31.800 --> 29:36.980]  you had all the pieces of what should be a delicious dinner, but it's just fucked.
[29:37.680 --> 29:44.080]  What is the movie equivalent of that for you? Because I just watched Glass. Oh, and I was so
[29:44.080 --> 29:48.540]  excited about it because I think Unbreakable is such a cool movie. And there's all this build up.
[29:48.620 --> 29:55.120]  They got all the actors back. They got everything on paper you would need for a great movie, a
[29:55.120 --> 30:00.340]  continuation of Unbreakable. And it is just one of the most disappointing films I've seen. And
[30:00.340 --> 30:07.440]  I have the perfect answer for that. I'm copying the movie image right now. So funny you asked
[30:07.440 --> 30:11.800]  that. I was thinking about this movie just the other day. Really? Nick, you think Alien 3 was
[30:11.800 --> 30:18.420]  close to being great? It could have been. Envy. Envy with Ben Stiller and Jack Black came out
[30:18.420 --> 30:23.580]  right when they were both exploding in popularity, and it was buried immediately in this movie.
[30:24.000 --> 30:30.340]  One of the two, I think Ben Stiller creates a thing called vapoo riser, which is an aerosol
[30:30.340 --> 30:34.720]  you spray on dog shit and it makes it go away. And then I think Jack Black tries to steal it
[30:34.720 --> 30:39.680]  from him or something. And it's them versus each other. It should be hilarious when they're both
[30:39.680 --> 30:45.240]  at the top of their comedic chops at the time. And it was such utter shit. It was buried
[30:45.240 --> 30:49.660]  immediately and they tried to keep it from coming out at all. I remember seeing that in theaters
[30:49.660 --> 30:56.200]  and not enjoying it as a child. Everything you need to make a funny movie. Jack Black, Ben Stiller,
[30:56.240 --> 31:02.080]  dog shit. Surely, though, you can tell that it's shit at the read through. I don't know how bad
[31:02.080 --> 31:08.560]  movies make it past the table read. It's a great question. I guess it depends, right?
[31:08.560 --> 31:14.420]  There's got to be so much money involved that they go, well, there's all this money involved.
[31:14.500 --> 31:20.380]  We got to just do it, I guess. And then there's bad direction. There's bad direction. There's
[31:20.380 --> 31:24.360]  good scripts that get directed poorly. But I think there's also a little bit of hubris, too. You know,
[31:24.400 --> 31:27.240]  like once you get to a certain level, and I'm not saying either of these two dudes had this
[31:27.240 --> 31:30.120]  because it was early in their career. But I think there's one once you get to a certain level,
[31:30.140 --> 31:32.680]  you look at a script and you go, you know what? I'm good enough to make this work.
[31:33.300 --> 31:38.480]  I'll just act the shit out of it, you know? Like, I feel like the first Expendables movie
[31:38.480 --> 31:43.920]  sucks, but the script was never good. And the problem is ultimately you can't see anything
[31:43.920 --> 31:48.100]  that's happening in that movie and it's shot really poorly, which is not something you would
[31:48.100 --> 31:54.920]  know in the table read. Wait, how can't you see it? It's just everything is dark and it's so
[31:54.920 --> 31:59.740]  like quickly edited, like all of the action choreography is terrible in it where they're
[31:59.740 --> 32:04.500]  just cutting constantly. So you just have no sense of what's happening. But by the way,
[32:04.740 --> 32:08.740]  Rachel Weisz, Christopher Walken and Amy Poehler were all also in that Envy movie.
[32:08.920 --> 32:14.880]  Whoa, really? Hell of a cast. It had to have been bad because I have a distinct memory of seeing
[32:14.880 --> 32:19.440]  that in theaters and thinking that was not great. And that is all I remember about it.
[32:19.900 --> 32:24.340]  I got another one while we're at it. Oh yeah, what is it? Hold on a sec, let me look it up.
[32:25.440 --> 32:29.000]  Can't think of the name of it off the top of my head. I couldn't think of anything more than
[32:29.000 --> 32:34.340]  glass for me. Gavin, do you have one? Isn't that where we had the whole conversation about
[32:34.340 --> 32:40.980]  the tuxedo? You think the tuxedo on paper would have been perfect? But they botched it somewhere?
[32:41.420 --> 32:44.820]  What about Beverly Hills Cop 3? Beverly Hills Cop 3 is a great movie!
[32:46.900 --> 32:50.800]  You guys are getting into this on here. This is so funny.
[32:52.180 --> 32:55.880]  I don't know what Andrew's doing. He seems to be saying he's seen all the Beverly Hills Cops
[32:56.420 --> 33:01.280]  3 is the best. I don't think you've seen them. I've seen them. What do you want from me? I think
[33:01.280 --> 33:05.620]  it's like when you were talking, you were giving me a minority report. I asked you to name a better
[33:05.620 --> 33:09.060]  action scene from either of the other ones. I'm waiting. I'm waiting for a real thing. Wait,
[33:09.100 --> 33:14.500]  so what did you ask for? I asked you to name a better action scene from either of the first
[33:14.500 --> 33:21.200]  two films. Then there's one in three and I'm still waiting. And I said the mansion scene in one and
[33:21.200 --> 33:27.580]  the cement truck in two. You think the mansion is good? Okay, what about the opening scene in one?
[33:28.780 --> 33:32.940]  He's in the truck, they're smashing the place up, shit gets smashed. Yeah, they're driving around.
[33:33.600 --> 33:38.260]  So what scene is better in three? I just, the film as a whole, I think.
[33:38.380 --> 33:42.580]  Ah, you've never seen it. He doesn't know what you're talking about. There's no way.
[33:42.740 --> 33:49.060]  Here's another one that I actually have seen. Screwed with Norm Macdonald, Dave Chappelle,
[33:49.060 --> 33:56.980]  Danny DeVito, and Sarah Silverman. A fake kidnapping movie. How is that a shitty movie? I
[33:56.980 --> 34:03.260]  challenge you to finish the film. As one of the world's biggest Norm Macdonald fans, and lucky
[34:03.260 --> 34:07.400]  enough to have an autograph of Norm Macdonald that Andrew got me, one of my prized possessions,
[34:07.560 --> 34:12.640]  I have never finished the film. It's not possible. It sounds like we've got some contenders for some new
[34:12.640 --> 34:17.940]  watchalongs. You don't think I know about Beverly Hills Cop? The man is in Beverly Hills. Okay,
[34:17.940 --> 34:21.380]  tell me what you've read on Wikipedia in the last two minutes. Go on.
[34:21.940 --> 34:27.100]  Ask me any question about Beverly Hills Cop. All right, who was not in three that was in one and
[34:27.100 --> 34:34.000]  two? Ask me any other question about Beverly Hills Cop. Okay, which character from one
[34:34.000 --> 34:41.340]  wasn't in two but came back for three? The art dealer lady. No. Shit, really?
[34:44.520 --> 34:51.720]  Fuck. Who else would have been one that isn't in two? I'm going to be honest. I hadn't seen it when
[34:51.720 --> 34:57.740]  I made the comment in the Slack and I tried to watch it all to catch up. You're such a menace,
[34:57.920 --> 35:04.400]  dude. Because I'm trying to get back at Gavin because I have some like playful Gavin beef
[35:04.400 --> 35:11.060]  recently. I feel like this is a thing I could get with him. I watched Beverly Hills Cop one
[35:11.060 --> 35:18.560]  in its entirety last night and I ran out of time on the second one. And the art dealer lady is the
[35:18.560 --> 35:25.000]  only person so far that was in the first that wasn't in the second. Because the Jeffrey guy,
[35:25.140 --> 35:32.780]  I'm blanking his name from aliens, he's back in one and two. Paul Reiser? Yeah, is the sheriff,
[35:34.380 --> 35:39.960]  the guy, he's back. How about Bronson Pinchot? Is he in two? I can't remember. I think he is though.
[35:39.960 --> 35:52.940]  I think so. No. No? Who's he? Who's Bronson Pinchot? He plays Balgi Bartokamus on Perfect
[35:52.940 --> 35:58.960]  Strangers. Balgi? I don't know what you're saying. I'm bad at character names. He was
[35:58.960 --> 36:04.260]  the funniest part of the first movie. He's the guy who was at the restaurant with the wacky
[36:04.760 --> 36:09.500]  address and the wacky accent. And Axel Foley was like, get the fuck out of here. And he's like,
[36:09.540 --> 36:14.740]  no dude, I cannot get the fuck out of here. Espresso with a hint of lime. They dragged
[36:14.740 --> 36:19.400]  him back out for the third one. They bring him back for the third? Yeah. They tried to make him
[36:19.400 --> 36:23.960]  do the same shit. But apparently, I've read this in the trivia, apparently Eddie Murphy was so
[36:23.960 --> 36:29.240]  depressed about how shit the movie was that he didn't, he wasn't even there for that scene. So
[36:29.240 --> 36:33.220]  there's a whole scene where they're doing like, I guess, trying to do all that ad-lib stuff again,
[36:33.220 --> 36:36.840]  except he's just ad-libbing with the director. And then they had to shoot Eddie Murphy.
[36:38.320 --> 36:43.620]  Seeing that last night really took the sails out of Jeremy Pivot in Rush Hour 2. It just
[36:43.620 --> 36:48.760]  made it feel like what he was doing there is a lesser of what was being done. Beverly Hills Cop
[36:48.760 --> 36:55.420]  1, that character. They had no idea what to expect when he did that character. They were like, just
[36:55.420 --> 37:01.920]  do a vaguely European accent. And he just made that up on the spot. And they were like, it was
[37:01.920 --> 37:05.320]  supposedly it was one of the hardest scenes they've ever liked to film to get through in the
[37:05.320 --> 37:10.560]  whole movie because nobody could keep a straight face through him. I am enjoying 2. I didn't realize
[37:10.560 --> 37:15.380]  it was a Tony Scott movie till the credits, obviously, in the beginning. Number 3 is
[37:15.380 --> 37:21.180]  definitely not a Tony Scott movie. No, he tapped out of 2. I'm excited to see 3. Honestly, the
[37:21.180 --> 37:25.140]  reason why I said it is because you're so annoyed that I like the most recent Matrix the most out
[37:25.140 --> 37:29.900]  of all of them. I was trying to tap into that again. Well, that is annoying. But that's just
[37:29.900 --> 37:35.560]  factual. What's your playful Gavin beef that you have going? What's? Oh, let's talk about playful
[37:35.560 --> 37:45.340]  Gavin. Yeah, please. I had to host a live stream the other week. I had to host a live stream because
[37:45.340 --> 37:51.520]  Nick and Eric were away and it was a disaster. Tried my best. I was trying to make it work.
[37:51.820 --> 37:59.260]  I had video on one feed. I had audio on the other feed. I was flipping around. Gavin is saying,
[37:59.260 --> 38:05.080]  this isn't working. That's not working. He has no solutions. The man has no idea. I'm not freaking
[38:05.080 --> 38:09.480]  out. I don't have OBS open. I don't know what you're fumbling around with. And my main beef,
[38:09.560 --> 38:14.680]  the whole reason I went in with, well, this isn't I didn't have beef. My main issue is that you
[38:14.680 --> 38:23.080]  showed up at 4.58 because you had to dump. We talked about why. Yeah, I'd listen. That was an
[38:23.080 --> 38:28.180]  unexpected thing. My stomach was upset. That threw off my whole calendar. That was the beginning of
[38:28.180 --> 38:32.420]  it not going well. We need to go back to the previous day, though, where I said, I don't know
[38:32.420 --> 38:38.560]  what I'm doing. It was the three of us. And it was like, who's going to stream? And I said, I don't
[38:38.560 --> 38:47.080]  know what I'm doing. Meanwhile, Jeff is streaming every day and Gavin's done a few streams. I'm the
[38:47.080 --> 38:51.560]  only one who doesn't stream. And I'm like, hey, I'll do it. I'll try. But I don't know what I'm
[38:51.560 --> 38:54.660]  doing. You've streamed more than both of us. You played all of Donkey Kong. No, I don't. What do
[38:54.660 --> 39:00.860]  you mean? What do you mean? You Donkey Kong'd. You did Halo. I only know how to stream on my
[39:00.860 --> 39:05.060]  PlayStation. I can't do anything else. I only know how to stream on my Xbox where there's no other
[39:05.060 --> 39:11.780]  audio feeds. I've only streamed from my pinball machine. Nick, we have jobs for life. We're set.
[39:12.020 --> 39:19.700]  This is great. Eric, Gavin was pointing, hey, your audio is off. This is off. Hey, this is broken.
[39:19.700 --> 39:25.020]  Why don't you do this? I was relaying what was being said in the chat, so we could try and fix
[39:25.020 --> 39:29.800]  it. Just in case you didn't know what wasn't working. And also, you didn't show up to streams
[39:29.800 --> 39:36.020]  more than two minutes before it starts. I didn't. Okay, first of all, you're gonna tell me. You're
[39:36.020 --> 39:41.700]  gonna tell me. He sat down with his butthole about probably 10 minutes too. Why don't we have a test
[39:41.700 --> 39:47.080]  about 20 minutes later? Wait, you're gonna tell me that I should show up quicker than two minutes
[39:47.080 --> 39:52.260]  before a thing? You're gonna tell me that? You're gonna say that to me right now? I don't know why
[39:52.260 --> 39:56.500]  there's applause, because you were the one who had to be hosting. And if it's not something you're
[39:56.500 --> 40:00.840]  comfortable with, let's all get together about 4.30 and just make sure everything's all right.
[40:00.960 --> 40:06.600]  Well, based on the feedback you had, you wouldn't have helped anyway. What do you mean? What I was
[40:06.600 --> 40:12.320]  saying was the audio's too loud or too low. I don't know. Yeah, I know that. I'm aware of that.
[40:12.320 --> 40:16.400]  We know the same thing. I'm dealing with it in Discord. Does that even affect Tobias? I don't know.
[40:16.860 --> 40:21.320]  I have no idea either. I have no clue. Gavin's just telling me all the things I know are broken.
[40:21.640 --> 40:24.440]  Nick, never leave. I love that this...
[40:27.040 --> 40:32.820]  Gavin is factually correct, but what he is leaving out is the snickering and the laughing
[40:32.820 --> 40:40.460]  and the minging that he was doing the entire time. What you're saying, like what Gavin is saying,
[40:40.460 --> 40:46.040]  is absolutely factually correct. What isn't coming through here is, and without even watching it,
[40:46.120 --> 40:50.820]  I know what it is. It's Andrew trying to fix it, feeling so flustered because he doesn't know how
[40:50.820 --> 40:56.480]  to fix it, but trying to. And Gavin just goes, and then Gavin goes, sounds low. And it's like...
[41:00.780 --> 41:05.360]  Before we started, I said, Nick, if their audio's messed up, how do I fix it? And he's like,
[41:05.380 --> 41:09.720]  you can increase it in Discord. And so when people are complaining about it,
[41:09.720 --> 41:14.840]  I started raising it in Discord. And then Gavin's saying, what you doing it in Discord for?
[41:15.640 --> 41:22.260]  Watch it, we're on the OBS. I was asking, does what you do at Discord even get reflected in OBS?
[41:22.260 --> 41:27.140]  That's not what you asked. It was never phrased as a question. It was always a statement of what
[41:27.140 --> 41:34.000]  are you doing? Gavin is retelling this so helpfully. Oh, absolutely. It is zero help.
[41:34.020 --> 41:39.000]  What did I actually say? I described it later as it was like I was drowning and he said, hey,
[41:39.000 --> 41:45.600]  you're drowning. And it's like, no shit. Can you help? Are you going to help? Hey, don't drown.
[41:46.540 --> 41:51.200]  I equated it afterwards. I posted a picture of a car that crashed into a lamppost with the quote,
[41:51.260 --> 41:59.400]  you can't park there, mate. It was a disaster. We made it through. I think I was I was a bit
[41:59.400 --> 42:04.000]  mingy at how late we got started. And we only stream for one hour a week. You think we should
[42:04.000 --> 42:09.700]  probably get it in order? So I was just worried that we were going to have an hour of crap.
[42:10.160 --> 42:16.080]  And instead, we had a hilarious hour of you two arguing while I sat back and watched. And I would
[42:16.080 --> 42:23.760]  have been there, but I had an hour of crap, Gavin. I tried. And if any of you fucks would have been
[42:23.760 --> 42:29.440]  willing to take it on, we would have had an alternate option. Well, we need to know this.
[42:29.440 --> 42:34.120]  You didn't say anything. If you had an hour of crap, how about a little message in Slack saying,
[42:34.260 --> 42:41.400]  hey, my arsehole's exploding. I was exploding. Get on Slack and tell us. We're there at 4.58
[42:41.400 --> 42:46.040]  wondering where you are. You've said nothing. You've said nothing. I will say we were a little
[42:46.040 --> 42:52.480]  we were sweating a little bit. It was a little nerve wracking. I was sweating. And I am a person
[42:52.480 --> 42:57.780]  who was afflicted with terrible doo doo all day long, every day. I've already taken four shits
[42:57.780 --> 43:02.600]  today. But I shit with my butt. I could use my hands to type. Even the worst poop, I could
[43:02.600 --> 43:06.780]  probably still be like. I've kept people informed I'm going to be late because of shitting. I feel
[43:06.780 --> 43:11.420]  like I was late to a gameplay recently because I kept wiping and it wasn't clean. It's true. You
[43:11.420 --> 43:16.340]  were late to a gameplay because you had a dirty butt. I remember you said that. I had to do two
[43:16.340 --> 43:21.960]  courtesy flushes to get it all off. Anyway, here. I agree it would have been better if I was there
[43:21.960 --> 43:28.280]  earlier. Completely agreed. Or, if you told us. Doesn't matter. That is irrelevant. You had a
[43:28.280 --> 43:33.540]  whole day. What do you mean I had a whole day? What? The day before. It doesn't matter. We're
[43:33.540 --> 43:38.800]  circling around. Things don't matter. I'm annoyed at Gavin. Playfully. I'm not really annoyed.
[43:40.840 --> 43:46.440]  You're insane. Respectfully. Playfully. Respectfully. The next day, the next day,
[43:47.180 --> 43:53.020]  I hear, oh, guess who's streaming? Guess who's got a stream set up? They're all of a sudden
[43:53.020 --> 44:00.960]  leading charge. I check Gavin's stream. This motherfucker has got four different camera feeds.
[44:01.620 --> 44:10.880]  Four camera feeds. I'm trying to run one camera in audio. He's got four feeds. He's talking about
[44:10.880 --> 44:16.820]  re-rigging pinball machines to make it optimal for streaming. He's the streaming wizard.
[44:17.500 --> 44:23.060]  He's streaming all over. It took me freaking ages and I didn't just decide to do it two minutes
[44:23.060 --> 44:26.900]  before I started. There was tons of prep. I didn't decide to do it two minutes before I started
[44:26.900 --> 44:33.600]  either. I decided when neither of you were willing to do it and then I tried to prep for it and it
[44:33.600 --> 44:38.760]  didn't work. And you're like, I don't know. I don't know how any of this works. Next day,
[44:38.760 --> 44:47.280]  four camera feeds. I'm still learning. Listen, to be fair, Andrew, I did consider hopping in
[44:47.280 --> 44:51.920]  and trying to take over the stream, but this just seemed a lot funnier. And so that from a
[44:53.560 --> 44:56.360]  producer's standpoint, I felt like it made more sense to let you guys flounder.
[44:57.140 --> 45:02.640]  I respect that completely. A massage chair might seem a bit extravagant,
[45:02.640 --> 45:06.860]  especially these days, eight different settings, adjustable intensity,
[45:07.380 --> 45:14.760]  plus it's heated and it just feels so good. Yes, a massage chair might seem a bit extravagant,
[45:15.080 --> 45:22.540]  but when it can come with a car, suddenly it seems quite practical. The all new 2025 Volkswagen
[45:22.540 --> 45:28.600]  Tiguan packed with premium features like available massaging front seats. It only feels extravagant.
[45:29.520 --> 45:34.240]  Today's top story, the flavor merger of the century between the Peanut Butter Group and
[45:34.240 --> 45:39.480]  Chocolaty Corp. Joining me is a PBC executive. Thanks for having me, Barry. Now, how did you
[45:39.480 --> 45:43.800]  know the merger and the byproduct of it, Jif Peanut Butter and Chocolate Flavored Spread,
[45:44.020 --> 45:49.760]  would be a success? You know, it was a gut feeling, a rumbling, if you will. Besides,
[45:50.160 --> 45:56.000]  they're two titans of taste. Very true. Goes great with pretzels. And pancakes. Apples too, I bet.
[45:56.000 --> 46:02.260]  Try Jif PBC today. And then you floundered in a different way on a thing we did later,
[46:02.360 --> 46:06.900]  and it was funny to see your approach to floundering. What did I flounder on? The
[46:06.900 --> 46:13.680]  Mario Party stream. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Fuck me. I've got to tell this story. Wait,
[46:13.740 --> 46:17.940]  what happened with that? I wasn't. I unfortunately wasn't there. What happened? Nothing. It was fine.
[46:18.020 --> 46:21.640]  We had a great stream. That's not what I'm hearing. I'm hearing you're floundering. What's
[46:21.640 --> 46:26.900]  going on? Days before, someone, I think Andrew, was ahead of the game. He was saying everyone needs
[46:26.900 --> 46:32.820]  to be wired into your Switch, right? Because of the way it does these lobbies. If people are on
[46:32.820 --> 46:36.380]  Wi-Fi, they'll drop out. It's a pain in the ass. So we're all like figuring out like, oh,
[46:36.440 --> 46:40.960]  the older docks don't have Ethernet. So we have to get USB adapters. But I have a new dock
[46:40.960 --> 46:44.800]  that does have Ethernet straight into it. So I was good. I don't need my old adapter.
[46:45.040 --> 46:50.580]  So I brought it all the way to boat day. And I brought it on the boat. I handed it over to Jeff.
[46:50.580 --> 46:59.920]  We go back. Jeff's dropping out of the game left and right. Discover he's put the USB to Ethernet
[46:59.920 --> 47:05.580]  adapter in his Switch dock. He's put in an Ethernet cable into that and connected the other
[47:05.580 --> 47:13.320]  end of the Ethernet cable into a Wi-Fi extender. Which is the best I can do because all of my
[47:13.320 --> 47:20.400]  computer setup is upstairs 150 feet away. But you're still on Wi-Fi. But at least I'm connected
[47:20.400 --> 47:28.160]  to a signal. How can it not be enough? Shut up for a second. Shut up for a second. How can it
[47:28.160 --> 47:36.040]  not be fast enough when I have 800 down and the same fucking room and 900 up? How is it not fast
[47:36.040 --> 47:42.260]  enough? The audio, the gameplay audio is slugging the entire time. How is it not fast enough? That
[47:42.260 --> 47:47.560]  was a gigabit Internet. Five gigabit Internet connection. Not fast enough. It's fucking
[47:48.260 --> 47:54.660]  bullshit. Two words. Dropped packets. So you've got the speed, but it's unstable. Correct.
[47:55.360 --> 48:01.060]  Jeff dropped out like five or six times. Well, I'm sorry that I can't reconfigure my entire house
[48:01.060 --> 48:06.780]  from a two-story home to a one-story home where I can set up a fucking computer downstairs in my
[48:06.780 --> 48:10.700]  living room where my Internet connection is. I could have given you like a 50-meter Ethernet
[48:10.700 --> 48:16.580]  cable. Yeah, apology accepted, dude. It's okay. Just, you know, next time I'm sure you can figure
[48:16.580 --> 48:23.040]  something out, right? Hey, you know what? Step one is showing up for the event. Great work.
[48:23.220 --> 48:28.640]  You did great, man. Step one, you crushed it. Four of us did an awesome job arriving at the
[48:28.640 --> 48:37.380]  event. One of us did not. So one of us can shut the fuck up. Nah, it was funny that it didn't
[48:37.380 --> 48:41.860]  really cause any problems. My favorite part, though, was that as Jeff was futzing around trying
[48:41.860 --> 48:47.020]  to rejoin the game, he accidentally paused his audio. No, no, no, no, not when he was futzing
[48:47.020 --> 48:52.940]  around trying to rejoin the game. Jeff's controller died and he didn't know how to fix it. And he
[48:52.940 --> 48:57.340]  didn't know if they had another controller. So then he left to get another controller. Then he
[48:57.340 --> 49:02.120]  couldn't figure out how to connect that controller. And in the middle of that futzing, which was like
[49:02.120 --> 49:08.580]  an hour into a three-hour recording, I hit my, yeah, he turned off his audio. It was a really
[49:08.580 --> 49:17.920]  fun stream. Then I caught it and fixed it. An hour later. That's why we have Craig. Yeah,
[49:18.140 --> 49:24.160]  absolutely. I'm just saying that that was, that was all the issues around you in a way that I
[49:24.160 --> 49:29.300]  don't think I've seen since we've been doing this. And it was fun to see you flounder. So what I'm
[49:29.300 --> 49:33.960]  saying is put me in charge of streaming. I clearly have it under control. You definitely want me at
[49:33.960 --> 49:40.440]  the helm. I've certainly established that I also should maintain my status. I just need to go
[49:40.440 --> 49:45.720]  through. I need to do one where I'm hosting with Nick there. And then it'll be once I learn what
[49:45.720 --> 49:52.140]  the dials do, I'm fine. I just don't know what anything does. And I think my setup is not great.
[49:52.700 --> 49:58.900]  I think what you sent me next for all of them. Listen, there's a slide that goes left. It goes
[49:58.900 --> 50:03.760]  right. All the things. Some things have negative numbers. There's a giant comical switch on the
[50:03.760 --> 50:11.060]  wall. Electricity is shooting out. I don't know. My board is shooting blue lights. The X on it is
[50:11.060 --> 50:17.620]  blue. I don't know what's happening. There's four mute buttons on this thing, but there's one mic.
[50:17.760 --> 50:24.040]  I don't know what I'm doing with this. There's five. There's five mute buttons and then an angry
[50:24.040 --> 50:30.480]  button on this thing. This is fucking great. Gavin, what does the angry button do? After we
[50:31.320 --> 50:37.080]  stop recording, you should press record and make a tutorial on the GoXLR based on what you think
[50:37.080 --> 50:44.780]  everything does. Oh yeah, that's a great idea. Well, like you explained streaming to us. Yeah.
[50:45.760 --> 50:53.320]  Most of it makes sense. Okay, mic. I get it. That makes sense. Chat. I'm not certain about that.
[50:53.320 --> 50:59.260]  That feels kind of confusing because chat is text. Unless it means chatting as in talking.
[50:59.480 --> 51:05.140]  In which case, would that not be mic? Isn't that us? Like if you turn that down, don't we go quiet?
[51:05.600 --> 51:12.940]  Oh, okay. That would make sense. And then music feels strangely specific to have a whole slider
[51:12.940 --> 51:19.300]  on. And then system makes sense to me. That's like the what you're piping in. Like if you're
[51:19.300 --> 51:25.280]  gameplay or whatever, I'd assume that would go there. I still don't know what the angry button
[51:25.280 --> 51:30.560]  does. And I don't know why there's a mic port at the bottom of the mic thing.
[51:33.580 --> 51:39.080]  This is my favorite segment we've ever done. You mean the headphone jack? No,
[51:39.200 --> 51:43.260]  there's a mic next to the headphone jack. There's a mic jack next to the headphone jack.
[51:43.280 --> 51:48.020]  An XLR jack? No, it's like a 3.5. It's probably for just a different type of mic.
[51:48.560 --> 51:54.180]  Okay. So if I wanted to run like a rock band mic through that, I would do it that way. Yeah.
[51:54.460 --> 52:00.620]  Why would you do that? I've been really into rock band recently. I kind of missed it when it came
[52:00.620 --> 52:05.020]  out. I just bought all of the guitar here on Rock Band Games. Do you do the singing?
[52:05.980 --> 52:12.360]  I was always more of a drum guy, but I was bad at it because I didn't realize you could just
[52:12.360 --> 52:19.180]  hold the foot pedal down. So my leg would cramp up after like three songs. I think I'm going to
[52:19.180 --> 52:23.700]  be a guitar guy, though, because it's just the easiest to do at your desk. That's fine. I don't
[52:23.700 --> 52:27.780]  think singing would be good. Those games are a lot of fun till you hit your own personal wall and
[52:27.780 --> 52:32.340]  realize you'll never get better. And then it gets frustrating as hell. I just want to go through
[52:32.340 --> 52:37.800]  the career modes like I'm not trying to perfect anything or get better times or scores. I guess
[52:37.800 --> 52:45.060]  you don't get times in rock band. That'd be weird. Beat the song faster. I beat Battery by Metallica
[52:45.060 --> 52:50.540]  in like a minute and a half. Dude, I got Freebird under two and a half minutes. It's crazy. I'm on the
[52:50.540 --> 52:59.420]  learning course. Speed running Rock Band 2. Buckethead in 60 seconds. It's the entire playthrough is just
[53:02.300 --> 53:05.740]  nothing's right. Do you want to hit my life hack?
[53:06.280 --> 53:12.940]  I see my notes. You've been teasing it. It's a life hack that was pretty good for two weeks and
[53:12.940 --> 53:21.860]  now is a tremendous face. Oh, so my office, right? Got a lot of shit in it. Got multiple computers.
[53:22.600 --> 53:28.340]  It's two up. So I drilled a hole in the wall and I put all the shit in the in the next room.
[53:29.300 --> 53:35.600]  And now my office is nice and cool. You drill the hole in the wall? Yep. See, this is why I don't
[53:35.600 --> 53:43.600]  know to drill. Oh, OK. So when you say you drill a hole in the wall, I get OK, I understand. It's
[53:43.600 --> 53:48.360]  just not where my head went when you said it the first time. OK, what did you think now that you
[53:48.360 --> 53:52.980]  drilled a fucking hole in the wall that you just got to drill? Put it in the wall and that was it.
[53:53.040 --> 53:58.040]  Oh, for like airflow? Yeah, like no, like you were trying out your new glory hole technology,
[53:58.040 --> 54:02.340]  just throwing it in like your office. Like he was Nicholson in The Shining with his head
[54:02.340 --> 54:08.100]  sticking out. There's no hole for the ball, so it's not a glory hole. So the computers now are
[54:08.100 --> 54:15.000]  both in the other room with the cables coming back into my office for the monitors. And how is that
[54:15.000 --> 54:20.900]  a fuckface? Because I decided that I want to stream from my Pimble machine, which is in that room.
[54:21.420 --> 54:27.880]  And now I'm hotter than ever trying to play Pimble. I'm just sweating all over myself.
[54:27.880 --> 54:32.640]  I did a stream. I did my first stream and I'm just sweating because I put everything
[54:32.640 --> 54:38.900]  in the same room. I forgot about sorry to just a quick detour with Gavin streaming.
[54:39.160 --> 54:45.380]  I was still very annoyed about all of Gavin's helpful tips during my stream. So I just wrote
[54:45.380 --> 54:51.000]  in his chat, your audio is low. And it brought me so much joy that Gavin took that as a real,
[54:51.480 --> 54:56.200]  real note. And he's like, no, actually, I think it's because I was speaking away from the mic.
[54:56.200 --> 55:01.300]  I have a history of fading. And then all the other comments were like,
[55:01.360 --> 55:04.960]  no, the audio is fine. And then Meg said, oh, that was Andrew wrote that.
[55:05.940 --> 55:13.020]  And you're like, oh, I didn't see your name, but I heard the comment, I think you did.
[55:13.400 --> 55:17.080]  Yeah, you heard it and you didn't you didn't register it was for me. So you took it as real,
[55:17.240 --> 55:24.900]  which I didn't anticipate. And I don't think your chat was amused by my fake note.
[55:26.540 --> 55:30.080]  Oh, well, I'm glad that your stream set up is fucked.
[55:32.260 --> 55:37.680]  Yeah. My office, though. Nice and cool. That's great. That's awesome. I'm glad.
[55:38.840 --> 55:42.660]  How's the oxygen levels? For that, I might need to drill a big hole.
[55:43.400 --> 55:46.300]  I don't mean this as a criticism, but do you live in a 90s arcade?
[55:46.840 --> 55:49.820]  I'm just looking at your floor. You don't like the rug?
[55:50.180 --> 55:54.600]  Yeah, hell yeah. I like it a lot. It's just is that the entire floor?
[55:55.460 --> 56:00.400]  Yeah. That's great. Well, I've got pinball machines in there, so I wanted to run.
[56:00.620 --> 56:04.520]  That's totally. Yeah, absolutely. For the audience who can't see it,
[56:04.560 --> 56:11.660]  it's a carpet or rug that looks as it's like a black spacey with bright, colorful rings.
[56:11.780 --> 56:18.180]  It looks like a 90s arcade carpet. It looks like what would be in a movie theater arcade.
[56:18.180 --> 56:24.960]  Yeah, I step into it. Whoa, pixels is what it that's what that carpet says.
[56:25.680 --> 56:30.120]  Should we talk about Boat Day? I'd love to hear about Boat Day.
[56:30.240 --> 56:33.480]  I guess you have enough. I guess this one's going to go long, man.
[56:33.520 --> 56:36.440]  We're going to talk about Boat Day here. Why don't we save it?
[56:36.840 --> 56:40.340]  Yeah, we'll save Boat Day. I have a little thing I can talk about that blew my mind.
[56:40.400 --> 56:45.360]  That's really dumb. And it's it's obvious. This is it. Let me just state this.
[56:45.360 --> 56:49.900]  This is one of those things I've never really thought about. And I think it's insane
[56:50.520 --> 56:55.760]  that this is how this works. But it just it's this is a definite me thing.
[56:56.660 --> 57:03.480]  I just processed. I was talking to some people. I never realized that the engagement ring and
[57:03.480 --> 57:08.540]  the wedding ring were two different things. And that seems insane that we're buying two rings.
[57:08.660 --> 57:12.400]  We're getting two rings. Wait, so you thought it just changed its name?
[57:12.900 --> 57:16.760]  Yeah. No, like, I just assumed it was all part of the same.
[57:17.080 --> 57:19.820]  Like, you get the ring. Yeah, I had no idea.
[57:20.380 --> 57:25.580]  OK, Andrew, I'll do you one better. I didn't know until my third marriage.
[57:27.740 --> 57:31.260]  I feel a lot better about this. What the fuck?
[57:31.360 --> 57:33.620]  The first two marriages, we just bought a wedding ring.
[57:33.700 --> 57:37.180]  But didn't you wear one? Yeah, it was just like that was it.
[57:37.420 --> 57:39.340]  There was no engagement ring. It was just a wedding ring.
[57:39.780 --> 57:41.320]  I didn't know about the difference between the two.
[57:41.320 --> 57:43.700]  How did you propose? Oh, Christ.
[57:45.300 --> 57:48.700]  With my mouth. I think I was.
[57:48.900 --> 57:51.180]  I think I was proposed to. I don't remember. Who can remember?
[57:51.380 --> 57:53.940]  It was so long ago. But yeah, it wasn't like...
[57:54.460 --> 57:59.240]  The first time I proposed was with like a 99 cent ring from a fucking gumball thing.
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.080]  Oh, are you Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible 3?
[58:02.540 --> 58:06.560]  No, I was eight, 19, 20 years old in fucking Alabama.
[58:07.960 --> 58:10.820]  It's too bad you weren't Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible 3. That's way cooler.
[58:11.320 --> 58:13.720]  It's a way better version of that. I agree.
[58:14.900 --> 58:19.320]  Um, I'm glad that was the thing where I didn't know if that was like the shift key type thing
[58:19.320 --> 58:22.040]  where to me is like, I just learned this and everyone's like, how do you know?
[58:22.520 --> 58:26.840]  I'm always paranoid about this. That was not as big of a deal as I thought it was.
[58:27.540 --> 58:31.380]  But you know, it is a big deal. Brazil, not Brazil.
[58:33.440 --> 58:35.980]  Fuck. Dude, you shouldn't be a countries guy.
[58:36.080 --> 58:37.940]  This is not good. Jamaica.
[58:38.480 --> 58:41.200]  Jamaica got a goal. Jamaica hit the over.
[58:42.160 --> 58:43.640]  Jamaica hit the over today.
[58:43.720 --> 58:47.980]  Oh, fuck. U.S. beats Serbia. Oh, man. The U.S. was down by like 14 there.
[58:48.140 --> 58:52.060]  And yeah, it was really bad. They came back a big way. Big, big, big.
[58:52.560 --> 58:55.020]  I've been enjoying keeping count of all of our medals.
[58:56.900 --> 59:00.700]  I've been keeping my eyes on Kazakhstan in a way I never thought I would.
[59:01.440 --> 59:04.680]  They're one away from hitting that over. And I think I'm an under on them.
[59:04.680 --> 59:08.680]  I think I should have done it the other way around, because I start this competition
[59:08.680 --> 59:11.340]  doing really well and I can only go downhill from there.
[59:11.820 --> 59:14.000]  Just watching you fall apart. It's great.
[59:14.920 --> 59:19.000]  Because the minute it starts, you have a flawless card, what none of us don't.
[59:19.360 --> 59:22.440]  And if you can just ride that high, there's joy in that.
[59:22.920 --> 59:27.280]  The problem is, if you watch the Olympics, you're cheering for nobody to ever win a gold medal,
[59:27.780 --> 59:29.020]  which makes it less fun.
[59:29.100 --> 59:30.820]  I want the countries not on the list to win.
[59:30.820 --> 59:38.040]  That's fair. Have you seen any countries that you're upset about winning?
[59:38.640 --> 59:41.320]  That you knew that you had the under on? You're like, oh, fuck.
[59:41.840 --> 59:42.740]  That might be a problem.
[59:43.520 --> 59:44.980]  I haven't seen any Olympics yet.
[59:45.300 --> 59:46.300]  Oh, you've missed all the Olympics?
[59:47.000 --> 59:47.240]  Yeah.
[59:47.660 --> 59:48.240]  That's too bad.
[59:49.480 --> 59:50.440]  At all?
[59:51.360 --> 59:52.200]  Yeah, haven't seen it.
[59:55.520 --> 59:57.740]  Wow. Not a big Olympics guy. Never been.
[59:58.100 --> 59:59.080]  It hasn't been hiding.
[59:59.080 --> 01:00:03.940]  Remember when I got attacked for being like, wait, you saw a trap after Eric said you saw a trap?
[01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:06.620]  Jeff just did it. Just Jeff just did what I said.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.340]  I did. I 100% did it.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:11.920]  The incredulous, like, did you mean what you just said?
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.040]  That's crazy.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:13.680]  It happens.
[01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:15.380]  People talk.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:16.200]  Really?
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:17.480]  Things exchange.
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:19.100]  Wow.
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.400]  Yeah, I hit up the World Cup and the Euros, but Olympics, I leave.
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:24.580]  Really? You're not like ever an Olympics guy?
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:27.300]  So this isn't just an off year for you? You don't watch them regularly?
[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:28.280]  No.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:29.940]  Oh, it's the best.
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:31.840]  Gavin, what a shame.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:34.240]  I'm with you. I don't watch the Olympics at all.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:35.340]  What a shame.
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.520]  I just, so not my speed.
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:39.580]  I'm sure I like it. I just haven't, I haven't really ever gotten into it.
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:40.880]  I need, I need someone to start.
[01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:44.760]  I don't know that your country gives you a lot of reason to be into it, but
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:49.260]  for countries like America, they're real good at stuff physically. It's a lot of fun to watch.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.820]  Well, there's like 330 million people here.
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:56.000]  Yeah. And we're all really fast.
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.100]  Who do you think's the fastest?
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.680]  I feel like U.S. over indexes in track and field.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.080]  Out of you four.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:04.860]  What?
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:06.920]  Who do you think could run the fastest hundred meter?
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:08.760]  Oh, probably Nick.
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:09.740]  Really?
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.080]  Why Nick?
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.040]  I guess we talked about this as a kid.
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:16.480]  Okay. Wait, Gavin, who do you think it is?
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:18.920]  Hmm.
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:21.260]  That's a good point.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:21.940]  Hundred meter.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:27.500]  That's a, I asked you, I asked you to answer the question.
[01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.020]  I then just started thinking about everyone else. I was like...
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.900]  Right. That's kind of all it took for me.
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.880]  Do you think it changes with more or less distance?
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:37.920]  Yes.
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:43.060]  I think it does. I think stamina would play a big difference in it.
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:44.960]  Who has more stamina than Nick?
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:45.960]  Yeah. Good question.
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:49.460]  Oh, I don't mean for first. I meant second through fourth.
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:53.020]  Oh, okay. Okay.
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:58.020]  So we got, we're, so we're figuring out who's competing for silver and bronze.
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.300]  There's three fucking medals at every competition, right?
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:05.140]  Well, okay. Why don't we do, why don't we do a hundred meters and then a 1500?
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:14.300]  Listen, 1500 is a fucking lot, first of all. But, uh, I am of an age I read on the internet
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:19.340]  six months ago or so, and maybe we talked about this. I am of an age where they said that men over
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:25.260]  people over 45 years of age should never run at a full sprint again for the rest of their lives.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.020]  What, like risk of injury or it's just bad?
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.400]  Yes, just, just risk of injury. Just like your body's not,
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:37.140]  not able to handle it at that age. And I feel like I'm in great fucking shape for a 49 year old.
[01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:41.500]  I rode 20 miles this morning on my bike, but, uh, I, why push it?
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:47.400]  All TikTok is, is like old dudes agreeing to run down the street,
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:54.700]  somebody going, go. And then 10 steps later, a guy pulled up going, my ACL, my ACL.
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:57.200]  I don't, I'm, yeah, I don't want to be that guy.
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:59.680]  But people are younger now when they're old.
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:02.840]  Yeah, I am. And I'm going to stay younger while I'm old.
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:10.320]  Like I was looking up the ages back to a Beverly Hills cop. Do you know how old this guy is in this
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:10.580]  movie?
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:11.520]  35.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.220]  16.
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:13.900]  He's literally 35.
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:14.860]  No.
[01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:18.000]  Yeah, I'm older than him.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.120]  Oh no.
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:21.900]  That's fucked.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.060]  Had to deal with Axel Foley is what happened.
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:26.560]  Yeah, that, yeah, that's true. It's pretty stressful, man.
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:30.240]  I showed a picture of, uh, Taggett from Beverly Hills cop.
[01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:30.680]  Yeah.
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:36.240]  The straight man of the tagger and, uh, who's the other guy? Uh, Billy Rosewood.
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:37.460]  Billy Rosewood. That's it.
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:42.760]  We should, we should wrap this one up because we have to do another one today and we are
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:46.380]  on to time for sure. And I know there's a lot more to talk about.
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:48.940]  I just want to make sure it gets in another episode full style.
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:52.980]  I just make one note. I thought it was weird when I watched Beverly Hills cop.
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:53.920]  It's in that photo.
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:04:00.100]  Taggart, the guy behind him plays Andrew. The only other movie I recognize him from
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:03.500]  is Deliverance, where he also plays Andrew. I thought that was odd.
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:04.640]  He's in Robocop.
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:07.860]  Oh, I don't even remember him in Robocop. Who's he in Robocop?
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:12.000]  He's one of the, uh, I think he's executive Andrew.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:12.220]  Mark.
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:13.800]  Shit.
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:17.600]  Good thing I'm Johnny Caviar.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:21.500]  Uh, uh, Andrew did a really good intro, so now you do a really good outro.
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:24.040]  Who's been the most Andrews in movies?
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:25.480]  Interesting.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:27.480]  Interesting.
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:32.060]  We should all find the actors who have played our names the most times.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:36.340]  All right, well, uh, we'll have that ready for you next episode.
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:39.160]  Uh, thanks for listening to, uh, Regulation Podcast.
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:42.920]  This was the 15th version, uh, or episode of this bullshit.
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.460]  Uh, maybe you liked it. I hope you did.
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.300]  Uh, if not, keep it to yourself.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:48.380]  And we'll see you next week.
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:50.760]  Andy Davis?
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:55.760]  Go to patreon.com slash the regulation pod and check out everything we have going on over there.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.420]  But I guess that's neither here nor there.
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:57.820]  Bye!
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:04:59.740]  Andrew Dufresne?
[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:03.140]  Andrew Beckett?
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:06.140]  Is Andy always short for Andrew?
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:07.640]  I think so.
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:09.800]  Anyway.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:10.820]  No way.
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:13.700]  So Andy in Toy Story was Andrew?
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:14.520]  Yeah.
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:16.880]  I don't know that you can claim that.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.560]  I just did.
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.800]  Try to fucking stop me, I'll do it again.
[01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:21.760]  Fair enough.
