[00:30.000 --> 00:33.640]  My name is Geoff Ramsey and with me as always Gavin Free,
[00:34.000 --> 00:38.920]  Andrew Panton, Eric Baddour, Nick Schwartz. Episode 9. Go!
[00:39.400 --> 00:42.440]  How do you shave without clogging a sink?
[00:43.680 --> 00:45.360]  You don't. Oh, actually...
[00:46.680 --> 00:51.200]  I mean, the answer I have is not far off from your answers. I shave outside.
[00:52.040 --> 00:54.280]  If I have to shave my beard off or something.
[00:54.680 --> 00:58.300]  Eric saw my outdoor shaving setup and he finds it repulsive.
[00:58.300 --> 01:04.440]  I, I want to, I'll post a picture here. Uh, it maybe isn't for public consumption.
[01:05.300 --> 01:13.920]  Um, just based on like your twisted fucking set, like this saw looking ass setup that you have
[01:13.920 --> 01:21.740]  for like, here's the first image. This is, this is where Gavin shaves.
[01:23.420 --> 01:27.560]  So you're looking at that and you're like, oh, this is just in the middle of,
[01:27.560 --> 01:36.120]  it truly is just in the middle of, there's the second image, just under a box on the side of
[01:36.120 --> 01:41.880]  his house near two pieces of a broken mirror. Andrew, thoughts? I think it's fine. Who cares?
[01:43.620 --> 01:49.000]  It's his fucking backyard. If he's standing in a bathroom at a mirror,
[01:49.280 --> 01:51.760]  I mean, there's a mirror out there. What do you want from him? It's fine.
[01:51.780 --> 01:54.060]  That's so interesting. You know, now, now here's the thing.
[01:54.180 --> 01:55.660]  That's a, that's a great question, Nick.
[01:55.660 --> 02:01.940]  Nick asks such a good question. Do you use the mirror? Do you crouch down? Well,
[02:01.960 --> 02:06.980]  Gavin, do you have any images you want to drop into this chat? So that way people can see
[02:07.640 --> 02:16.320]  how you shave like a monkey man? You have, oh, you, you, that, now that, yeah. Okay.
[02:26.660 --> 02:31.840]  Uh, for the audience that can't see this, because I doubt these images will come out.
[02:32.200 --> 02:35.920]  Gavin is in a squat as if he's taking a shit on the ground,
[02:36.360 --> 02:40.380]  shaving in front of the broken mirrors as close to earth as he can get.
[02:41.860 --> 02:45.640]  You look like, you look like you're scared you're going to fall off the ground.
[02:45.700 --> 02:48.720]  Here's the thing about a mirror when it breaks, it's all still a mirror.
[02:49.860 --> 02:56.300]  Yeah, this, so, so this all started because we had Chris Damaris on 100%EAT on the Michael
[02:56.300 --> 03:00.680]  Jordan podcast. And he talked about how he evolved shaving. We were swimming the other day
[03:00.680 --> 03:05.080]  and brought this up. He said he evolved shaving by hanging a mirror in a tree and he's been
[03:05.080 --> 03:10.880]  shaving outside and, uh, a room of 150 people laughed at him like for a very long time.
[03:10.920 --> 03:17.580]  And then Gavin went, I shave outside and then showed me his setup. It was like, oh no.
[03:18.720 --> 03:23.080]  Yeah. For those who can't see, it's just sort of tucked around the side. Uh, there's just two
[03:23.080 --> 03:27.860]  pieces of a broken mirror on the ground and I squat real close up right next to it. Uh, first
[03:27.860 --> 03:32.520]  I have to dust off the mirror because it's covered in pollen constantly. And then I just have a
[03:32.520 --> 03:36.960]  little shave. You got to figure out the mirror situation. And if you do that, then I'm fully
[03:36.960 --> 03:43.860]  on board. Me too. I have no problem with this. If the, if the mirror is hanging, this all makes
[03:43.860 --> 03:52.220]  sense. It's two broken shards of a mirror in the rocky ground, leaned up against the side of a
[03:52.220 --> 04:00.940]  house. It's the storm drain it like it's all. Uh, so what would you do with, with my situation?
[04:01.060 --> 04:05.560]  How would you put the mirror up on something? He'd probably get a different mirror. Yeah.
[04:05.620 --> 04:09.880]  Different mirror and double-sided tape. Like he'd probably give up on that one. Yeah.
[04:09.880 --> 04:18.600]  Double-sided tape work on what is that shit? Stucco? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you could, you could
[04:18.600 --> 04:24.840]  try or, you know, there is that box that is right above where the mirror is where you could probably
[04:24.840 --> 04:32.520]  like lean a mirror. I don't know. I don't want to kill people walking by knocking it down and
[04:32.520 --> 04:37.300]  putting the razor sharp shard into their foot. Well, I mean, your lawn guy doesn't go this
[04:37.300 --> 04:41.520]  way anymore. Cause you're your lawn guy. So you don't have anything to worry about. It's true.
[04:41.760 --> 04:48.780]  I think realistically Velcro is probably going to be a real assistant here. You know what? Some
[04:48.780 --> 04:55.520]  people use nails or screws. It's not like you can't put a screw in the outside. That's how all
[04:55.520 --> 05:03.060]  that shit is hanging off of it. Have you screwed it to stucco? Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. For 10
[05:03.060 --> 05:07.620]  minutes. The problem is that pollen gets on the mirror every day. So I think the solution is you
[05:07.620 --> 05:14.440]  have a smaller internal mirror that has Velcro on it and you have the Velcro strips outside and
[05:14.440 --> 05:20.140]  you bring the mirror out with you, attach it to the Velcro, do your shave, then bring the mirror
[05:20.140 --> 05:24.560]  back in with you when you're done. I like the idea of having a little go bag by the door for my
[05:24.560 --> 05:30.400]  shaving kit. Yeah, exactly. Nick said, what if you put a window there with a mirror on the other side?
[05:30.400 --> 05:36.160]  So I'd be looking... That now we're talking. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So from the inside, there's
[05:36.160 --> 05:43.720]  just a mirror that's facing the wrong way blocking a window. Yeah. What if you just have a regular
[05:43.720 --> 05:50.500]  ass mirror outside but you install windshield wipers on it? Oh, that's nice. What if it's a
[05:50.500 --> 05:55.820]  two-way mirror? So it just looks like a window from the inside and the outside. And then Meg can
[05:55.820 --> 06:02.460]  watch you. Shmi can watch you right there. Shmi will sit watching you shave and you won't even know.
[06:03.600 --> 06:08.180]  Now, that's the best idea yet. I love that idea. And then you can bring people to that
[06:08.180 --> 06:11.400]  part of the yard and interrogate them and then Shmi and Meg can watch.
[06:13.780 --> 06:21.840]  Just like at the police station. Or, or, hear me out, you drill a second hole
[06:21.840 --> 06:26.960]  in your bathroom wall, one for the razor blades, the other for your facial hair,
[06:27.180 --> 06:32.060]  and you just start shoving your facial hair through the back of your wall. So I just catch it
[06:32.060 --> 06:36.960]  and mail it out? Uh, yeah, just have it, have it catch in some way, just grab it in your hands,
[06:37.060 --> 06:41.420]  I guess, all the way down and then just push that through the wall. Oh, maybe I could get,
[06:41.720 --> 06:46.640]  you know, those like old school whole house vacuum things like this, like vacuum ports.
[06:46.900 --> 06:50.600]  The ones that go under the floor. Yeah. What if I just have one of those, but it's just a tube
[06:50.600 --> 06:56.320]  to the outside? No, you want it in your wall because hair, hair acts as a natural insulator.
[06:56.420 --> 07:00.320]  You'll be making your house more energy efficient. Fill up my walls with my beard.
[07:00.840 --> 07:07.060]  Yeah, yeah, it's green, Gavin. What would typically be a small house fire erupted in a
[07:07.060 --> 07:14.260]  massive blaze? Can you imagine a house burning built out of hair? It would be the worst fucking
[07:14.260 --> 07:20.840]  smell on earth. Dude, it would be like it would be the greatest like final immunity fire challenge
[07:20.840 --> 07:26.500]  win of all time. You would instantly it's all it would burn out so quick. The worst part of this
[07:26.500 --> 07:33.000]  setup is that I was cleaning out my gutters a few months ago and I found a shitload of my beard up
[07:33.000 --> 07:45.260]  in one of the gutters. Oh, wow. The the birds had used it for nesting. That's great. So you're
[07:45.260 --> 07:50.820]  helping the birds. It was the inside of one of my cushions, my outdoor cushions. Squirrels have
[07:50.820 --> 07:54.140]  shredded that and the birds stole it. And then they also mixed it with a little bit of my beard
[07:54.140 --> 08:00.080]  for the optimal bird nest. Oh, you know what you could do? You know what you could do? You could
[08:00.080 --> 08:04.060]  take this in a different direction. You could be more community oriented. Do you know and to spread
[08:04.060 --> 08:07.080]  the word, you know how people have those little lending libraries in their front yard where you
[08:07.080 --> 08:11.760]  put like a little box on a stick and you throw books in it? Yeah. What if you'd made a lending
[08:11.760 --> 08:16.520]  shaving library where you just stuck that in your front yard and then people could come by and then
[08:16.520 --> 08:20.320]  they could shave right there. You just have a stick with a mirror on it and like a little shelf
[08:20.320 --> 08:24.240]  to put your stuff. It's like a communal shaving station. Yeah, just like anybody in the neighborhood
[08:24.240 --> 08:28.160]  when they're walking by, they could be like, oh, I'll do a quick shave. I bet I could put that out,
[08:28.160 --> 08:33.160]  leave it there for a year and not a single person would ever touch it. I'd be the only place I'd
[08:33.160 --> 08:38.600]  shave. I would come once a week just to shave. I don't even shave. I would come every week just
[08:38.600 --> 08:44.380]  to shave right there, hoping that I would run into other people to build a shaving community.
[08:45.040 --> 08:48.360]  What a fascinating idea. Be a field of dreams. If you build it, they'll come.
[08:48.840 --> 08:54.680]  If you build it, they'll shave. I don't think so. So am I providing the shaver there? No, I think
[08:54.680 --> 08:58.760]  you provide your own. Well, I mean, it could be like a lending library, right? So maybe you like
[08:59.260 --> 09:03.140]  take a book, leave a book kind of thing. Yeah, that's you have to you have to put in the starter.
[09:03.260 --> 09:07.760]  You provide you provide seed shaving. Yeah. And you'll put like Gillette and somebody else
[09:07.760 --> 09:13.340]  to be like, oh, no, I like I like a dollar shave club myself and build out. Then we'll have variety.
[09:16.180 --> 09:20.020]  What does it look like? Is it a house? What does the shave box look like?
[09:20.440 --> 09:22.980]  Oh, I think it could look like anything you want it to.
[09:23.800 --> 09:26.580]  Um, what would you want it to look like? I think it should just look like a bathroom
[09:26.580 --> 09:29.880]  mirror on a stick. Yeah, I agree.
[09:32.040 --> 09:37.760]  It would be nice if there was some. Now, how would that work? I was thinking like somehow
[09:38.300 --> 09:44.360]  it's like a face and the more full it is, the fuller the face looks like you do it.
[09:44.360 --> 09:51.100]  You could visually tell how much supplies. Well, I'm trying to keep going. Keep going.
[09:51.220 --> 09:55.520]  No, no, keep going. This is good. Listen. Yeah, we're in a fantasy world in which you have set up
[09:55.520 --> 10:01.220]  a shave station outside that is communal, but it's still bound by the laws of physics. Yeah,
[10:01.360 --> 10:08.760]  carry on. OK, but it could be it could be something where it's like a like a like a
[10:08.760 --> 10:13.860]  what's the word I'm looking for? Not plastic, like a not a leather thing. You know what?
[10:13.860 --> 10:21.740]  Like a like a sheet, like a sheet of some kind, like fabric, not fabric, but not plastic like
[10:21.740 --> 10:28.260]  stretchy. It's like a stretchy material. Yeah, like an elastic tight cover. Rubber is what I
[10:28.260 --> 10:37.260]  was looking for. Thank you. A rubber like material that the more you put stuff in, the further the
[10:37.260 --> 10:47.080]  face pushes out. So you can tell because it's the box is a face. The box, if it's empty, looks
[10:47.080 --> 10:55.000]  like a clean shaven face. And if it's full, it like push it. I don't know. Well, listen, we'll
[10:55.000 --> 11:02.240]  figure it out. We'll figure it out. We'll scout some hair from the birds. We'll borrow some of
[11:02.240 --> 11:09.000]  your facial hair back from the birds. And it will be like a chia pet where the more stuff in it
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.760]  pushes the hair outward of the face. So people could go like, oh, shit, the box is empty. It's
[11:14.760 --> 11:20.420]  clean shaven. Or, oh, my God, that is a massive beard. There is tons of supplies in this shave
[11:20.420 --> 11:25.560]  box. It sounds like we're making a giant communal voodoo doll. Well, what do you mean by that?
[11:25.760 --> 11:30.800]  Well, it's just going to be a but it's going to put a face on it somehow with hair that grows.
[11:30.800 --> 11:34.780]  Is a Cabbage Patch Kid a voodoo doll? Just because you put a face on something doesn't
[11:34.780 --> 11:39.980]  make it a voodoo doll. I mean, I think it could be. But does a Cabbage Patch Kid have real human
[11:39.980 --> 11:44.580]  hair on it? I don't think it's real hair, but I bet you there's a doll out there that has real
[11:44.580 --> 11:51.520]  human hair. What? Where? Really? Do you think? I don't know. I think somewhere. Probably. You
[11:51.520 --> 11:56.100]  could probably buy a doll that has human hair because people donate hair all the time. You
[11:56.100 --> 12:00.180]  can buy wigs with real human hair. Yeah, but I feel like that's a good use for it. Not a doll.
[12:00.800 --> 12:07.180]  Is the Play-Doh thing a voodoo doll? That's definitely not a voodoo doll. Also, is this
[12:07.180 --> 12:11.380]  what you're talking about? Like, then you put stuff in the box and it grows Play-Doh hair or
[12:11.380 --> 12:20.600]  something? Yeah, like it pushes the things in the box push the hair outward. If you gave me a sieve
[12:20.600 --> 12:25.160]  and a handful of hair, I couldn't push the hair through it. Well, that sounds like a you problem.
[12:25.360 --> 12:30.180]  We're not talking about you. Yeah, yeah, this box has it all figured out, Gavin. How come you can't
[12:30.180 --> 12:35.080]  do it? I'm not asking you to physically push that. And I was just throwing it out as a concept.
[12:35.220 --> 12:39.800]  I just like the idea of there being a visual indicator without having to open the box of
[12:39.800 --> 12:45.180]  how full the box is. And it made sense to me that if it's a shave box, it would be somehow
[12:45.180 --> 12:50.840]  beard related. So what we need when you have a bathroom mirror on a stick next to it is. I put
[12:50.840 --> 12:56.460]  one right there in the chat. Just stick that bottom part in the ground. Next to it is a mannequin head
[12:56.460 --> 13:01.680]  with like a glue trap on the chin and everyone could just stick their minging beard hair to it.
[13:02.780 --> 13:08.840]  Okay, listen, that's that's a more realistic idea. I want to be clear. I'm the guy that threw out you
[13:08.840 --> 13:14.220]  should put Velcro on your wall. I started very practical. I would argue maybe the most practical,
[13:14.640 --> 13:19.320]  the least invasive to the space, least amount of work. But you realize the Velcro isn't the
[13:19.320 --> 13:24.700]  attachment to the wall. I still have to get the Velcro on the wall. Yeah, it works both ways.
[13:24.700 --> 13:30.620]  You attach when you listen to someone who's made a wrist pocket with Velcro. Half of it is
[13:30.620 --> 13:35.580]  tapeable. Yeah. And you put that part to the wall, the tapeable part. Yeah. That you peel.
[13:36.140 --> 13:39.440]  And then you put the other half that attaches to the back of the mirror.
[13:40.280 --> 13:43.560]  Yeah, sure. I'm just going to come and go. The first time I use it, I'm pulling that tape
[13:43.560 --> 13:48.080]  straight off of the Velcro on the back. Who the fuck do you think you are? Respectfully,
[13:48.080 --> 13:52.740]  you're not Hercules, okay? That Velcro's going to stick. You think you're fucking
[13:53.280 --> 13:57.820]  sword in the stone, like you're King Arthur, like you're the fucking knight in shaver?
[13:58.100 --> 14:02.660]  Get out of here. That mirror's just coming off. It's going to stay. It's fine.
[14:04.540 --> 14:09.640]  Can you say anything like that? Just say respectfully and you get away with it?
[14:13.440 --> 14:19.040]  Respectfully, do you think any of this tells the story? Like if somebody walks by and they see it,
[14:19.080 --> 14:22.580]  do you think they know? Or do you think we're going to have to help them by doing something
[14:23.860 --> 14:30.440]  like putting a sign up? Nobody's going to know. Here's what I'm thinking. Here's a quick little
[14:30.440 --> 14:37.780]  mock-up I did. Oh, cool. You could have hit the undo button a couple of times.
[14:38.340 --> 14:43.060]  You can read it. You can see it. It's a folding sign that says shave with an arrow pointed in
[14:43.060 --> 14:49.000]  and it'll be pointed towards the mirror. So that way people will know. I didn't have room for the
[14:49.000 --> 14:57.540]  E. I had to go back. Maybe this is like a lemonade stand that also has shaving. Nick's set looks like
[14:57.540 --> 15:05.060]  a trap by the coyote. It does. This is how Gavin is going to get Nick in a trap. It's going to be
[15:05.060 --> 15:10.600]  that and a bunch of breadcrumbs under a box. Might as well just say tarts on it and then he's done.
[15:19.610 --> 15:24.110]  All right then. Well then, you genius schmuck, respectfully, how do you shave? Where does
[15:24.110 --> 15:30.810]  your beard go? I don't shave. You don't shave a beard? No, I haven't shaved in like three years.
[15:30.910 --> 15:37.070]  I got tired of shaving, so I just stopped. What, is it down to your nipples? No, it's maintained.
[15:37.070 --> 15:42.850]  It's fine. It's where it is. It's just critical mass. Yeah, when I got my haircut like, I don't
[15:42.850 --> 15:46.190]  know, five months ago, it got trimmed a little bit by the guy. I didn't even ask for it. He just
[15:46.190 --> 15:51.850]  trimmed it, styled it a little bit. You still don't have a beard in my head. I don't know why I can't
[15:51.850 --> 15:57.990]  apply the beard. I got sick of shaving, so I just said I'm not going to do this anymore. Is this you?
[15:58.450 --> 16:06.810]  No, way less. Three years is less than that? Yeah. Do you put oils in it? Do you comb it?
[16:06.950 --> 16:13.670]  No, absolutely not. Huh. Because I didn't feel like shaving anymore. That would then just be
[16:13.670 --> 16:18.930]  beard work. The point is, I didn't want to do face work. I would just be moving the shave work to the
[16:18.930 --> 16:23.190]  beard work, and I have no interest in the beard work. You just wanted to eliminate work from the
[16:23.190 --> 16:27.650]  beard. I just wanted to get rid of it. I just didn't care about any of it, so I moved on.
[16:29.130 --> 16:36.990]  I'm going to get oils. Is it a style choice? You must shampoo it and stuff. That's beard work.
[16:37.470 --> 16:41.390]  Yeah, well, this is part of the show. I mean, I'm getting blasted in the face and my beard is there.
[16:41.750 --> 16:45.770]  Yeah, he's already doing water work. It just happens to be a part of it. The water work is
[16:45.770 --> 16:50.630]  part of... yeah, it's not additional work. Huh. I mean, I guess you're not supposed to
[16:50.630 --> 16:56.330]  I don't know. It's a whole thing. You surely need to trim the sides, like around the
[16:56.830 --> 17:01.670]  cheeks backed by the ears, otherwise it's going to come out sideways. No, I don't. Listen, the
[17:01.670 --> 17:06.290]  whole point... this was not, as I said, a style thing. I don't care about that. This was a
[17:07.090 --> 17:13.150]  protesting against the work of shaving. Protesting? Well, protesting is maybe a strong word. I was
[17:13.150 --> 17:19.450]  done with it. So you would say your face is a protest? That's... maybe, I guess. I don't know,
[17:19.450 --> 17:24.070]  but not, like, actively. I'm not going to make signs. Well, it seems like... that seems like
[17:24.070 --> 17:29.350]  more work. How much is visible from the back? Like, if we had to draw a silhouette from behind,
[17:29.550 --> 17:34.070]  how much of your beard is sticking out from your head? I don't... listen, I don't... I think that's
[17:34.070 --> 17:40.770]  a tough thing because of the size of my head. I don't know if that... But the size of your head,
[17:41.010 --> 17:46.090]  the beard should be appropriate to the size of your head because the beard grows out of this...
[17:46.090 --> 17:50.290]  out of that sized head. It grows out of the edge of your head. I'm going to be honest,
[17:50.390 --> 17:57.270]  I don't look at myself from the back all that often, so I couldn't... I'm not sure. Are you
[17:57.270 --> 18:03.570]  saying you have the facial hair of a much smaller man? I think I probably do. He has a full beard,
[18:03.610 --> 18:10.850]  but it looks like a goatee on Andrew. It's not... well, yeah. It's bigger than a goatee.
[18:11.410 --> 18:17.110]  It kind of curls, so it kind of waves. I think that's probably helping for the length.
[18:17.470 --> 18:21.830]  And when you get a haircut, they don't mess with it? No, they did. That's what I said last time
[18:21.830 --> 18:27.110]  I got a haircut. Oh. The guy, uh, Johnny Trimmed It, which was great. I didn't ask for it. I'd
[18:27.110 --> 18:31.890]  never... Johnny... I don't know. Johnny Caviar? John... uh, my barber... the barber... Johnny
[18:31.890 --> 18:38.110]  the barber. If you... if... yeah, but... but his name being Johnny doesn't... I don't... you're
[18:38.110 --> 18:42.270]  going to tell me you're going to... we're going to... I don't believe that. And I think we're
[18:42.270 --> 18:46.650]  going to find out that you're a barber on the side. I'm not... listen, I'm not in the Freemasons,
[18:46.790 --> 18:53.270]  OK? I don't... I can't claim the qualification. What if we find out that there is an actual
[18:53.270 --> 18:58.050]  Johnny Caviar who lives somewhere in the Naimo that Andrew has stolen the identity of?
[18:58.270 --> 19:03.410]  It's exactly what's going to... that's what's happening. There's a 72-year-old barber on
[19:04.670 --> 19:09.670]  Vancouver Island named Johnny Caviar. He was a 72-year-old barber when he was cutting hair at
[19:09.670 --> 19:14.570]  the old folks' home, and then he died, and his identity was assumed. He might be dead.
[19:16.610 --> 19:18.990]  Andrew went there to pick... to get his haircut one day, and they're like,
[19:19.050 --> 19:22.850]  oh no, he's dead, but he left this box of stuff. Would you mail his death certificate?
[19:23.010 --> 19:29.910]  Andrew's like, yeah, sure, no problem. Trash. I take over the identity? No, didn't happen.
[19:30.450 --> 19:35.150]  Johnny's great. I don't get my hair cut often. It's maybe like a once a year thing. I think last
[19:35.150 --> 19:40.270]  time was like a year and a half or two years between cuts. Johnny's great. He might be dead,
[19:40.330 --> 19:45.890]  but he's great. No, I haven't heard from him in two years. No, he's good. Well, he thought I didn't...
[19:45.890 --> 19:51.650]  he subscribed to the podcast the first time I went, and then I guess somebody mentioned
[19:52.750 --> 19:58.290]  hearing about his barbershop on the podcast, and then he thought that I didn't like the cut
[19:58.290 --> 20:02.790]  because I never showed up again. I just I just didn't cut my hair in the time period between.
[20:03.190 --> 20:08.610]  It's like a two year hiatus. I'll be back in like a year and a half. I'll circle around.
[20:10.910 --> 20:15.350]  Check in on things. It's nice to touch base every two years with someone.
[20:16.850 --> 20:20.990]  A lot happens in that time. It's easy to find conversation when you have a two year window.
[20:21.470 --> 20:25.010]  Yeah, but then all you're doing is catching up. That's great, though. That's the cycle you and
[20:25.010 --> 20:30.030]  I were on for a long time, Andrew. That's not true. Oh, once we had a one time cycle of that.
[20:30.510 --> 20:36.110]  Yeah. One time. That's not a lot. Do you think two years from now you'll reconnect with Johnny
[20:36.110 --> 20:42.170]  and then you guys will start a podcast together? No. No. I don't want to fuck up my haircutting
[20:42.170 --> 20:48.050]  situation. I don't want to get a new guy. It's tough to get a new guy going back to the first
[20:48.050 --> 20:54.830]  episode. Some things are just more important. Yeah. Like not shaving. Sick of it. Gotta get
[20:54.830 --> 21:00.330]  the blades and then they get dull and then you have to get the cream. And I never was confident
[21:00.330 --> 21:06.390]  I was doing it right to begin with. Just use like an electric trimmer. That seems intense.
[21:07.470 --> 21:12.350]  Don't trust it? Yeah. It's not that I don't trust it. I'm sure it has an instruction manual
[21:12.850 --> 21:18.650]  on the inside. I just I don't know how to do that. If I'm not confident in my ability to use
[21:18.650 --> 21:24.130]  the handheld, going electric seems like a big step. It's still handheld. It's not like a lawnmower.
[21:25.030 --> 21:31.390]  No, but it does the brrrr. Well, I mean, a lawnmower is handheld, too, unless you're sitting
[21:31.390 --> 21:36.470]  on it. Oh, that's true. It's hand and gravity held. Are you not holding the wheel when you're
[21:36.470 --> 21:40.670]  sitting on it? Yeah, but that's more like you wouldn't say a car is handheld.
[21:43.670 --> 21:48.170]  What would you say a car is, though? I think it's more immersive than that. I think it's a
[21:48.750 --> 21:54.850]  it's more of a it's more of a full experience. It's a fully 3D immersive experience.
[21:55.030 --> 21:59.410]  A fully? OK, well, everything could be a fully 3D immersive experience.
[21:59.810 --> 22:05.710]  If the doors on the shave station open up wide and you're fully surrounded, that's fully 3D.
[22:05.790 --> 22:10.530]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks. It's the classic
[22:10.530 --> 22:15.610]  blended iced coffee you know and love, now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar
[22:15.610 --> 22:20.470]  cold foam available for a limited time. Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[22:21.150 --> 22:28.410]  Hey, it's Paris. You know I love sparkly things, right? Like stars. Duh. And thanks to Hilton and
[22:28.410 --> 22:35.030]  AutoCamp, I just slept under them. Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious
[22:35.030 --> 22:42.230]  Airstream, making s'mores with the kids while a national park is our backdrop. The great outdoors
[22:42.230 --> 22:49.910]  meets Hilton hospitality. That's hot. Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com. Hilton for the
[22:49.910 --> 22:58.810]  stay. Speaking of experiences, Andrew, I had an experience around you today, about you,
[22:59.270 --> 23:06.290]  that I was not prepared for. Full disclosure, we're recording Episode 9 here the day after
[23:06.290 --> 23:10.650]  we recorded Episode 8. And right after we ended, I mentioned that I was going to mail you a care
[23:10.650 --> 23:15.810]  package. I have your Kerwin Frost McDonald action figures that I need to give back to you that we
[23:15.810 --> 23:21.810]  opened on the break show. I have just some random like face stuff. I think there's like a sloppy
[23:21.810 --> 23:26.890]  Joe's bingo in there for some reason. I don't even remember why. And also the two video games I went
[23:26.890 --> 23:35.230]  to Las Vegas to get for you four years ago. I put those in there. And I put in the GoXLR mixer that
[23:35.230 --> 23:41.010]  I bought that doesn't work on a Mac so that we can upgrade your audio. And then I went swung by
[23:41.010 --> 23:45.070]  Gavin's house and he gave me a phone to put in there. Which, by the way, the phone says it
[23:45.070 --> 23:50.970]  contains soy oil, which I thought was interesting. I didn't know phones contained soy oil. It was a
[23:51.390 --> 23:57.010]  sign on the back of the box that said contains soy oil. Wow. Did you have to declare that?
[23:57.930 --> 24:04.110]  Probably. So then I just put all that shit in a box and then I went with your address and I went
[24:04.110 --> 24:09.130]  to the place to mail shit. I'm not going to out the company, but it wasn't the post office. And I
[24:09.130 --> 24:13.270]  said, I'd like to mail this to my friend in Canada, please. And she said, is it a gift? And I said,
[24:13.290 --> 24:18.910]  absolutely. It's a series of gifts I'm giving a friend. And she said, OK, I need to look at them.
[24:18.990 --> 24:21.990]  And I'm like, excuse me. And she's like, I have to look at all of them. And I'm like, OK, well,
[24:22.030 --> 24:26.110]  thank God they weren't wrapped. But she's like, but the box was open, so it wasn't a big deal.
[24:26.630 --> 24:33.290]  And then she meticulously had to enter in every single item. And I was like, can't we just say
[24:33.290 --> 24:39.750]  toys? And she's like, no, they won't let us. Three employees got involved. I mean, seriously,
[24:39.930 --> 24:44.810]  like, OK, one, what would you call this action figure? It's a McDonald's action figure. One
[24:45.150 --> 24:50.450]  McDonald's action figure. And what is the value of that one? It's like a dollar. She's like, OK,
[24:50.470 --> 24:55.130]  one dollar. Next action figure. And and we went through all like we went through like 15 of them.
[24:55.290 --> 24:58.190]  And each time I'd be like, can't we just say like all the action figures together? And she's like,
[24:58.210 --> 25:01.290]  no, I have to list each item individually. And then I thought she was going to have to list the
[25:01.290 --> 25:05.290]  pants and the hats and shit, but she didn't. She just wrote that down as accessories. Anyway,
[25:05.510 --> 25:09.370]  it took her about 25 minutes to enter it all into the computer. And then there was an error.
[25:09.990 --> 25:16.210]  And then she had to start over. And so she did it all over again. And then there was an error.
[25:16.210 --> 25:20.350]  And all three of the employees decided maybe a different computer would work. Anyway,
[25:21.170 --> 25:28.610]  two computers and four tries. Forty eight minutes later, I mailed your package.
[25:28.610 --> 25:34.790]  I was the only person in that store for 48 minutes while three employees tried to mail
[25:34.790 --> 25:44.410]  one fucking box of nothing to Canada. How is it? How is it so complicated? I feel like society as
[25:44.410 --> 25:52.850]  it as as a whole is grinding to a halt under just superfluous bureaucracy and paperwork.
[25:53.150 --> 25:58.270]  I don't understand how things have gotten so slow. God help you. You have to call somebody
[25:58.270 --> 26:03.130]  on the phone to do something. I already bitched about the AT&T thing. It took a fucking year to
[26:03.130 --> 26:08.730]  get new Internet at my house. And now it takes a fucking hour to mail a box of toys to a friend
[26:08.730 --> 26:13.710]  in a neighboring country and two hundred dollars, by the way, which is more than any of that shit
[26:13.710 --> 26:19.270]  was worth. I just don't understand how it got so fucking hard. It's twenty twenty four. We're
[26:19.270 --> 26:24.810]  living in the Jetsons fucking future and it's harder to mail a box than it was 10 years ago.
[26:26.390 --> 26:31.210]  How? And that is the exact reason why that phone has been on my desk for three months.
[26:31.710 --> 26:35.270]  You guys are just bad at mailing stuff. You come here and mail you stuff.
[26:36.230 --> 26:41.650]  Oh, and also I'm calling dibs on last in the line to mail Andrew again. Next time it's somebody else.
[26:41.830 --> 26:48.330]  That's fucking... I got angry. I was so mad. I don't need it. I mailed him a puzzle yesterday,
[26:48.510 --> 26:53.450]  so it's got to be him next. I need to figure out where I'm going to do that puzzle. I don't have
[26:53.450 --> 26:59.690]  a table. I'll figure it out. I don't want a table. We just spent money on it. This was like,
[26:59.770 --> 27:04.250]  yeah, this is like one of our first like company purchases. And you're. Yeah, I'll figure it out.
[27:04.370 --> 27:08.170]  Nothing was prepared for the puzzle like you did. What do you mean prepared for the puzzle? You're
[27:08.170 --> 27:12.610]  going to like build it on your bed. This is not going to be good. That is a consideration. I'll
[27:12.610 --> 27:18.130]  probably reorganize my desk is what I'm thinking. This is going to be worse. It seems like you
[27:18.130 --> 27:24.970]  should just do it on the floor. You can fit a 500 piece puzzle on your desk. I have a really big
[27:24.970 --> 27:30.410]  desk. I have. Here's the problem with my desk. And we're going to get in my desk for a minute.
[27:30.970 --> 27:37.010]  I have I have to connect. The microphone I use has one of those clamps on it, right?
[27:37.230 --> 27:41.990]  Where you put this on the fridge. Well, it's now on a small table. It wouldn't work in the fridge,
[27:42.010 --> 27:45.990]  unfortunately, still on the table. I guess we went over this. It's too thick. They don't make
[27:45.990 --> 27:51.670]  clamps big enough to clamp onto my desk. It's a real annoyance because my desk is massive.
[27:52.090 --> 27:57.630]  It's very thick, large desk. I bet I could find a I bet I could find a clamp big enough. I
[27:58.070 --> 28:03.530]  guarantee you can't. I got a clamp that could probably clamp around my fist, like thumb to
[28:03.530 --> 28:09.510]  little finger. Is your is your desk fatter than that? I just made a fist. It's significantly
[28:09.510 --> 28:14.110]  smaller than the thickness of my desk. I need a picture of your fist with the desk.
[28:15.350 --> 28:22.980]  Oh, OK. Let me try to figure this out. We're asking him to post pictures of the Umi Digi
[28:22.980 --> 28:28.140]  Bison again. Like, this is not. Also, even when he gets the cell phone, he's still using the Umi
[28:28.140 --> 28:35.120]  Digi Bison. Jeff, I don't want to mail anything to Andrew. I'm not doing it next. I'll do it.
[28:35.300 --> 28:39.540]  I'll do it when it's my turn again, but it's not my turn again. That's a 12 inch clamp. Surely that
[28:39.540 --> 28:45.220]  would work. That might be too lightweight for the mic on. Yeah, there's no way that's going to hold
[28:45.220 --> 28:50.080]  the mic. You think so? Dude, those are that's those are designed to hold two by fours together.
[28:50.300 --> 28:56.060]  I think it's huge. That's like woodworking shit. Yeah, maybe a couple of them. Yeah.
[28:56.600 --> 29:02.740]  The clamping capacity is 300 pounds. It's a 12 inch bar clamp. Throat depth is three and three
[29:02.740 --> 29:08.100]  sixteenths of an inch. It weighs two pounds. What? Throat depth. Throat depth. And yeah,
[29:08.100 --> 29:12.680]  yeah, they say it right here. They said the Orwin clamp 12 inch with a three
[29:13.220 --> 29:19.420]  inch three and three sixteenths inch throat depth truly is the throat goat of clamps.
[29:19.960 --> 29:23.800]  What do you think your throat depth is? Yeah, should we find out who the throat goat is of
[29:23.800 --> 29:28.620]  the regulation podcast? I wanted to put a balloon in and measure, but you wouldn't let me. Oh,
[29:28.660 --> 29:34.820]  we could do that now. No, no. Do you understand that that wasn't legal saying we can't do that?
[29:34.820 --> 29:38.540]  That was me saying, I don't want to watch one of you die. We certainly can't do it now.
[29:38.660 --> 29:42.720]  We certainly can't do it now where my mortgage hinges on you guys doing the show.
[29:43.020 --> 29:48.120]  What are you talking about? Don't die from a balloon stunt. We're also losing health insurance
[29:48.120 --> 29:55.880]  soon. What? So what is the risk? Are you worried about the balloon sucking, getting stuck over the
[29:55.880 --> 30:01.600]  air hole? Yes. Yes. Nothing has changed. Nothing has changed from what has happened originally.
[30:01.600 --> 30:03.900]  Do you think that I couldn't? Yes.
[30:05.440 --> 30:10.520]  I think that's the end. That's the end. I think you couldn't. That's the end.
[30:12.760 --> 30:16.200]  Oh, so that's a well, it's fat because it's a.
[30:18.380 --> 30:23.400]  It looks like you're fighting it. I was a fighting desk. It's a it's like doom and first
[30:23.400 --> 30:36.180]  person. Yeah. But as you see, it's it's multiple. You get a context of width with the Xbox games
[30:36.180 --> 30:49.680]  and the first. That's a great picture. So let me go back to your clamp from this Erwin clamp.
[30:50.000 --> 30:53.020]  Where do I strap the mic in? Oh, I don't know.
[30:53.400 --> 30:58.140]  Yeah, I mean, I wasn't I wasn't going to bring it up, but you're 100, Andrew, you're 100% right
[30:58.140 --> 31:01.340]  in this whole situation. There's all kinds of different kinds of clamps. I'm just saying.
[31:01.460 --> 31:04.840]  I've looked at them. You can't find one. You said you'd find one that would work.
[31:04.980 --> 31:09.120]  You could go to Uline and Google giant clamp. I'm sure one of them will work.
[31:09.440 --> 31:14.980]  I'm going to go. Why are you? No, stop for a second. You just claimed you could easily do
[31:14.980 --> 31:18.540]  this or that you could do this. And then I challenge you and your response is go to a
[31:18.540 --> 31:23.180]  website and find it. I've done the research. I've looked. I'm telling you there isn't.
[31:23.180 --> 31:28.980]  You're in the party that thinks there is. It is on you to find one. It is not on me to redo
[31:28.980 --> 31:33.860]  my research. OK, send me a picture of what I need to clamp and how it needs to look and I'll find a
[31:33.860 --> 31:38.700]  solution. OK, I'm having trouble. I'm having trouble visualizing what I'm looking at. The
[31:38.700 --> 31:42.220]  clamp that I went to and get my biggest clamp that definitely would be too small.
[31:43.140 --> 31:46.160]  That's what I'm looking at. I've looked at them. They're all too small.
[31:46.960 --> 31:49.680]  I'm going to need I'm going to need detailed photos so I can fix this for you.
[31:49.680 --> 31:55.300]  Here's what you do. See that drawer? Yeah. Get rid of it. Tried it. I've done that. I've
[31:55.300 --> 31:59.820]  tried that. You've tried to remove the drawer. Here's the problem. I've removed the drawer.
[32:00.400 --> 32:08.920]  The thickness of the clamp is larger than the inside of the drawer. I can't fit the clamp
[32:09.660 --> 32:15.220]  in the drawer. It is too. The drawer itself is too small. Here's an idea.
[32:20.020 --> 32:26.360]  Hold on just a second. What if you got. My problem solver is on this podcast. A bench vice.
[32:27.840 --> 32:31.540]  You screw that into the top and then you can clamp anything.
[32:32.400 --> 32:38.120]  The top looks kind of like glass, though. What is on the top? What is that? It's like a red.
[32:39.480 --> 32:47.980]  It's like a red car thing. It's a vice. It's a red car. Is that what you said? No, I said like
[32:47.980 --> 32:54.180]  that. I feel like you'd see that in a mechanical workshop. It's just about holding something.
[32:54.440 --> 32:59.000]  Yeah, it's just to hold shit. I just I've seen casino and it didn't look like that.
[32:59.120 --> 33:04.720]  The red, the bright red really threw me. There's all kinds of there's all kinds of weird clamps
[33:04.720 --> 33:07.840]  that I bet would do shit like you can do all kinds of stuff with that thing.
[33:10.400 --> 33:16.680]  And I mean, your desk is so big that it shouldn't be a problem that this thing is the size of a 15
[33:16.680 --> 33:21.540]  pound weight, you know, so it should be fine. That's a plate right there, man. Easy. You could
[33:21.540 --> 33:29.340]  also just get a desk stand for a mic. It's too heavy. The arm is too heavy. What arm? Get rid
[33:29.340 --> 33:36.820]  of the arm. Why do I like the arm? Why am I getting rid of the arm? This is my this is my
[33:36.820 --> 33:45.140]  favorite podcast. We're coming up for solutions for a guy who doesn't want them.
[33:47.160 --> 33:52.980]  I desperately want them. I'm going to need to see your set. I'm going to need to see my set right
[33:52.980 --> 33:57.840]  now. I'm sending to you right now. I got an image. I'm not looking. I don't need it to be aggressive.
[33:57.940 --> 34:02.620]  I'm just saying at some point I need to see it. And then that way I can help find this. It's going
[34:02.620 --> 34:10.880]  to be right here. There you go. There it is. That's what I'm dealing with. Yeah. Oh, yeah. So
[34:10.880 --> 34:17.700]  I've looked at the on desk options. How about this, right? See the like conical part,
[34:17.780 --> 34:23.880]  the actual clamp part, the cone. Yeah. Get rid of that. Yeah. Drill a hole. Drill a hole in the
[34:23.880 --> 34:31.960]  desk and then stick the thing that's in that cone in the hole. Yeah. I need a drill. Well,
[34:31.980 --> 34:38.260]  you're going to need that anyway to drill a hole for the vice. Yeah, it's the biggest hurdle is
[34:38.260 --> 34:42.320]  I would need a drill. Well, how do you how do you make a hole currently?
[34:44.120 --> 34:47.420]  I haven't needed to make a hole in a while. I guess typically a shovel.
[34:49.020 --> 34:56.400]  I meant like in the wall. Well, hold on. Do you have a shovel? And a hammer? Maybe with a hammer
[34:57.160 --> 35:04.300]  for a wall. I can't remember the last time I had a drill. No, I agree. Andrew, I'm with you. Get
[35:04.300 --> 35:08.560]  a shovel. Like if you wanted to drill into a stud, like hang something on a stud, something
[35:08.560 --> 35:13.300]  of weight, like a shelf. How do you do that with a shovel? I'm taping that fucking thing.
[35:13.660 --> 35:22.640]  Are you kidding me? I'm getting I'm getting that wall tape. That's what I'm doing. Wall tape and
[35:22.640 --> 35:30.100]  Velcro. Yeah. Well, not Velcro. Velcro, you'll see that sticky wall stuff you could use. I bet we
[35:30.100 --> 35:36.100]  could get you a new desk. No, my desk is great. I don't need a desk. You just need a different
[35:36.100 --> 35:41.560]  clamp that goes with that Rode mic arm. That's all you need. This is my Velcro solution. I'm
[35:41.560 --> 35:48.300]  thinking about getting a small piece of wood, like a square piece of wood, and just nailing that to
[35:48.300 --> 35:53.500]  the corner of my desk and then having the clamp attached to the wood. That's a great idea.
[35:54.860 --> 35:59.600]  I think that might be the fix. That's easier than drilling a hole. I mean, I have like an actual
[35:59.600 --> 36:04.420]  solution, but I don't want to share it. No, I mean, like, you're good. It seems like you're good.
[36:04.520 --> 36:08.540]  It seems like you just should get a piece of wood and you got it. I agree. I'd love to hear what
[36:08.540 --> 36:13.640]  your solution is. It's just this other compatible Rode arm that you drill into your desk. Once
[36:14.020 --> 36:21.980]  again, once again, it's a drill out situation. We'll just get a shovel. Here's what you do.
[36:21.980 --> 36:29.060]  You take the drawer out, right? Then the piece of wood that supports the drawer
[36:29.600 --> 36:32.720]  stops it from falling down onto the ground. Get rid of that too.
[36:33.540 --> 36:37.560]  There's a piece? Like the bottom of the the bit behind your little finger.
[36:38.340 --> 36:46.880]  Okay. Yeah. And then clamp it on. I'll, uh, I don't, listen, I've done this. I've tried a lot
[36:46.880 --> 36:49.700]  of things. I'll try it again. I don't think it works.
[36:51.380 --> 36:55.280]  Well, on the bright side, I've heard at least three different ways to make this work.
[36:55.840 --> 36:58.860]  Now, I think the nail with the wood is probably the best.
[36:59.400 --> 37:04.500]  I, you know what? I agree. I retract my idea and I'm going to go with, I just don't have a drill.
[37:04.880 --> 37:08.900]  No, no, I do. A hundred percent. Yeah. Yeah. You should do a drill.
[37:09.380 --> 37:13.240]  Do you know? No, no, no, no. Get the piece of nickel. Send you a piece of wood.
[37:14.060 --> 37:18.440]  No, but hold on. Do you have a piece of wood? No. Do you have a nail?
[37:19.580 --> 37:23.560]  Probably. I could probably find a nail. Okay. Do you have a hammer?
[37:24.720 --> 37:30.580]  Dah, yeah. Absolutely. Cheaper to buy a piece of wood than it is to buy a drill. So go with that
[37:30.580 --> 37:35.440]  solution. I feel like I could just go to like Home Depot and buy a two by four and say,
[37:35.540 --> 37:42.220]  can you cut this to be a two by three? Absolutely. Yeah. And that's definitely a thing you're going
[37:42.220 --> 37:46.280]  to do. Yeah. A hundred percent. Here's the thing, Andrew, you need a drill.
[37:46.920 --> 37:50.040]  For what? It's just life. Future. The future.
[37:52.340 --> 37:55.420]  Strongly disagree. You don't think you'll ever need a drill.
[37:56.060 --> 38:00.240]  I mean, I've gone almost 30 years without needing one. I don't listen.
[38:00.880 --> 38:05.700]  Here's the fear about Andrew getting a drill. You've just given Andrew a drill.
[38:08.080 --> 38:13.840]  You know what I mean? Now suddenly, now suddenly, like what is it? When all you have is a hammer,
[38:13.840 --> 38:19.860]  all the world's problems look like a nail. You've just everything's going to look like
[38:19.860 --> 38:24.000]  a drillable problems or every problem is going to have a drillable solution.
[38:24.440 --> 38:28.440]  You do need to think of it as that. Like I'm a character in a video game and you've given me
[38:28.440 --> 38:35.920]  a new tool. And now every problem I encounter, the drill will be a consideration for fixing that
[38:35.920 --> 38:42.120]  problem. You'll have a whisk lodged up in Milwaukee. What did I buy a staple gun for? I bought a
[38:42.120 --> 38:45.720]  staple gun for like we're going to have to we're going to have to explain to Andrew why he can't
[38:45.720 --> 38:53.300]  drill through a mirror. I bought a staple gun when I was doing the sleep spaghetti. That's why I
[38:53.300 --> 38:58.640]  bought a staple gun. Oh, what? I didn't work a fucking sentence. What a goddamn sentence.
[38:58.840 --> 39:04.540]  Do you think you think this you think you could staple the the two by four to your desk or is
[39:04.540 --> 39:08.740]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm just going to fucking nail that fucking thing into my desk
[39:08.740 --> 39:14.300]  and make it sturdy. Yeah, I'm excited. I think you should try this for the next recording. No,
[39:14.400 --> 39:21.200]  I'm not. I was going to. I got to go to get one piece of wood. Oh, wait, no, there'll be a break.
[39:21.360 --> 39:25.820]  Never mind. Yeah, maybe. Maybe. Yeah, because this is a Friday and then we're not recording a show
[39:25.820 --> 39:31.580]  next week. This could. Yeah, yeah, I could have done it anyway. But yeah, that that gives you
[39:31.580 --> 39:37.160]  that gives you arguably just about 14 days to acquire one piece of wood. That seems like a
[39:37.160 --> 39:45.100]  doable adventure. Yeah, let's see. I mean, Home Depot guys, this is the best. This is the you
[39:45.100 --> 39:50.400]  might even have a local hardware store closer than Home Depot. Home hardware is closer, but I
[39:50.400 --> 39:55.860]  just there you go. Tractor supply or whatnot. The main brand. Well, you know, you don't need to.
[39:55.940 --> 40:00.080]  Andrew, can I just say right now, I'm going to stop you right now as a as a as a former homeowner,
[40:00.240 --> 40:04.700]  a three time homeowner. You don't need name brand wood. You just need wood. Yeah,
[40:04.700 --> 40:08.540]  wood to me is all the same. I meant the like the business of buying it from
[40:09.840 --> 40:15.700]  apply. You definitely want to support a mega corporation. Never mind. Can I can I propose
[40:15.700 --> 40:20.080]  that like if you go like you're going to get the wood and everything and like just inspiration
[40:20.080 --> 40:25.000]  strikes you, I kind of want you to just like follow that thread. Yeah, you you might be
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.580]  surprised just walking through the the hand tool and woodworking section. Jeff starts seeing all
[40:29.580 --> 40:33.860]  the different clamps and things they got going on in there. Well, you see a vice in person.
[40:33.860 --> 40:41.100]  You might. Yeah. Inspiration may strike. Yeah. Forty eight. You might you might see one in
[40:41.100 --> 40:48.080]  person and go, this is a cool red car and I got to have it. This is better. Fourteen ninety eight.
[40:48.280 --> 40:53.360]  While he's doing that, Eric, explain to me how Jeff could. OK, the balloon is popped to Jeff's
[40:53.360 --> 40:57.920]  mouth, right? I don't understand. You don't get about it. It's that it's that you breathe it in.
[40:58.180 --> 41:03.840]  There's a shock and you go as the thing explodes and it goes in your throat and we have to fish
[41:03.840 --> 41:09.660]  it out and we don't in time and you die. Yeah. You don't think I could fish out rubber from
[41:09.660 --> 41:19.180]  Jeff's throat? No, no, not quick enough. It's not going to pop. One inch by 24 inches.
[41:20.140 --> 41:25.320]  What if it was a cellophane bag? How is that better? I don't know.
[41:25.320 --> 41:37.920]  OK. This is like that time when Gavin was convinced that it was safe to put coke and
[41:37.920 --> 41:41.800]  Mentos in his own butthole and shoot it out with a funnel. And then we watched a video
[41:41.800 --> 41:47.200]  and discovered it's not. And people get hurt. You can't do that. I don't care mostly about
[41:47.200 --> 41:52.220]  people getting hurt. It's the dying thing that like, yeah, really, because I'll be on the hook
[41:52.220 --> 41:56.920]  for it. And I don't want that. That's fair. Nobody wants to be on the hook for death.
[41:56.920 --> 42:01.680]  How else could we? OK, what about this? We see who can hold the most water in their mouth
[42:01.680 --> 42:04.880]  and then gauze the water into a cup and we take the measurement that way.
[42:05.340 --> 42:09.460]  I like that. That's totally fine. I think that's great. I think it's fantastic. And
[42:09.460 --> 42:17.060]  that's the throat goat. Yeah. Yeah. Nick doesn't sound like he's in, but I feel like on the day of
[42:17.060 --> 42:23.620]  he will be. Yeah, probably. So we'll all just sit around a table and gauze into like a Pyrex
[42:23.620 --> 42:27.620]  and see who wins. Yeah, I think it's a good idea. I think that's a good idea. Well, I think it
[42:27.620 --> 42:31.600]  should probably be colored liquid so that way we can like like visually we want it to be stunning
[42:31.600 --> 42:37.420]  and we should all have different colors like I can be green, you can be red, like that kind of thing.
[42:37.740 --> 42:43.820]  Andrew, are you in? He's still looking at wood. He's looking at wood. I think he's doing it. He's
[42:43.820 --> 42:50.060]  trying to see how much water he can fit in his mouth. Do you have like a way of measuring the
[42:50.060 --> 43:05.080]  water? This is the best show in the world. Why are you holding it? You're not going to make any more.
[43:05.280 --> 43:10.300]  If anything, you're going to lose it the longer you hold it. Holding it in makes absolutely no
[43:10.300 --> 43:15.280]  fucking sense. I mean, no, the problem, the problem was I didn't realize the thing I was
[43:15.280 --> 43:19.700]  going to spit it into had water in it already. It was a real conundrum. What do I do?
[43:20.060 --> 43:26.040]  That's a real Die Hard 3 problem right there. Yeah, I guess, you know, you're about to spit it
[43:26.040 --> 43:33.300]  into a cup full of toothpaste water. I mean, I just spit it out. Yeah. I don't know how to measure
[43:33.300 --> 43:40.140]  this. I don't really know what I accomplished here. I don't even know how big this cup is.
[43:40.420 --> 43:45.760]  I don't even have a context. Anyway, I'm getting my reps in. I'm getting practice. I know some
[43:45.760 --> 43:50.880]  technique. Yeah. Maybe we can incorporate the Gerpler somehow. That's what I drank it out of.
[43:50.980 --> 43:58.780]  I had a Gerpler. I was like, what if the new Gerpler has lines on it for like the throat goat
[43:59.300 --> 44:07.180]  Gerpler? Oh, that's it. What? Okay. What if each of the lines is how much liquid we all hold? So
[44:07.180 --> 44:12.780]  that way you can know if you hold more than Nick. That's a great idea. And Nick just said the
[44:12.780 --> 44:19.320]  throatler. The throatler. Yeah, you can measure your throat to our throats. I love this. A
[44:19.320 --> 44:26.360]  regulation throatler. I want to be. This is nothing to do with throats, by the way, which I think makes
[44:26.360 --> 44:32.360]  it especially funny. Well, yeah, but it's funny. It gives all these. Yeah, it's really like the
[44:32.360 --> 44:39.000]  cheek goat. Yeah. Well, think of it. Think of it like this way. The throat is like the table leg
[44:39.000 --> 44:45.360]  of the mouth. So you have to have a strong throat to support all the water that goes into your mouth.
[44:45.620 --> 44:51.820]  They're all connected. This episode is brought to you by State Farm. Checking off the boxes on your

[45:49.460 --> 45:56.100]  at this poster and I just was just cracking up because I'm an immature moron. I was just imagining
[45:56.100 --> 45:59.920]  that scene in the Matrix, but Morpheus has two spoons instead of two pills.
[46:02.940 --> 46:09.700]  Imagine the reflection in his glasses. He's like, you take the DayQuil or the NightQuil.
[46:11.840 --> 46:14.720]  And I had to explain to the pharmacist why I was laughing.
[46:15.180 --> 46:22.500]  Oh, it's so funny. I mean, the hard part, Gavin, the hard part is there is no spoon.
[46:22.500 --> 46:26.500]  There is no spoon. I mean, they should have done it because it's a spoon heavy movie.
[46:28.980 --> 46:33.640]  Hey, I have a, I have a cultural idea, multicultural idea. I want to run by you guys.
[46:33.900 --> 46:39.320]  I was watching a TikTok the other day and it was of a British person at a high school football game,
[46:39.320 --> 46:43.700]  like in America, and going like, I can't believe this shit is real. I just, I really genuinely
[46:43.700 --> 46:46.980]  thought that was the only stuff you see in the movies. Do people really have like high school
[46:46.980 --> 46:51.000]  football games every Friday night all across America? And I thought that was kind of funny.
[46:51.560 --> 46:55.240]  And I was thinking about how, Gavin, you've lived in America for a very long time now.
[46:55.820 --> 47:02.100]  And I wonder how much like American stuff you've done versus haven't done. And then that got me
[47:02.100 --> 47:07.700]  thinking about what would be the most, if you just wanted to design a day and just say, I'm
[47:07.700 --> 47:14.060]  going to give somebody the full American, like the most American day from like breakfast to when you
[47:14.060 --> 47:19.000]  go to bed at night, what are those activities? And then it hit me, we have a Brit and a Canadian.
[47:19.000 --> 47:24.140]  So we could have, we could each design the full American day, the full British day,
[47:24.180 --> 47:30.980]  and the full Canadian day as like, this is like what a regulation like top tier Canadian day is.
[47:31.040 --> 47:34.280]  If you want to, you want to absorb Canada in one day period, this is what it is,
[47:34.560 --> 47:39.080]  UK, America. What do you guys think about that? I love it. Like the British gauntlet.
[47:39.880 --> 47:43.540]  Yeah. Like the British gauntlet. Yeah. It's like you start with a full English and then you do,
[47:43.540 --> 47:46.840]  I don't know, high tea at some point, right? And then you probably, there's probably something
[47:46.840 --> 47:50.540]  else involved. Then pop up the hill for some cheese rolling. Yeah. You do something else
[47:50.540 --> 47:54.720]  with your, I assume British people do something else, right? You collect spoons and watch a,
[47:55.760 --> 47:59.480]  I don't know, watch the queen on a parade. I imagine the American day is, and then you fire
[47:59.480 --> 48:03.220]  your gun in the air and then you go to the next thing and then you fire your gun in the air. Like
[48:03.220 --> 48:07.980]  it's Yosemite Sam is what I'm imagining. I, it would, I would probably, it'd probably involve
[48:07.980 --> 48:14.100]  a rodeo. Honestly, I was thinking. Yeah. Firing guns in a rodeo, like not at the same time,
[48:14.100 --> 48:18.820]  but those two activities I think would both be in there. Be some, let it be like intertubing on a,
[48:18.960 --> 48:24.520]  like on a swampy Creek or lake somewhere. There'd be a definitely hot dogs. There'd be fireworks.
[48:25.060 --> 48:28.880]  I was talking the other day about how I thought lacrosse was fictional and just for the movies.
[48:30.860 --> 48:35.920]  Realized it was a real thing. It looks so made up. Can you imagine creating something so lame
[48:37.500 --> 48:41.880]  as lacrosse? Just visually. Yeah. Just visually. Like if you're going to make a fake sport,
[48:41.880 --> 48:47.020]  I'm not saying lacrosse within the context of reality is lame, but in a world in which
[48:47.020 --> 48:53.300]  you're inventing a sport for a film, the best you can do is lacrosse. What a lame thing to
[48:53.300 --> 49:00.740]  come up with. I agree. I agree with you. It is like looking at it. It's like, what if Quidditch
[49:00.740 --> 49:07.140]  was worse and everyone just ran around? Like it's just so yeah. It's hockey for dudes who can't
[49:07.820 --> 49:13.580]  The thing that I love the most about this conversation is that for the last year I was
[49:13.580 --> 49:18.220]  in the army, I was the I was the press agent, the one man press office for the United States
[49:18.220 --> 49:23.700]  Military Academy's preparatory school in New Jersey. And they had a lacrosse team and they
[49:23.700 --> 49:29.960]  would scrimmage against the West Point lacrosse team back and forth. And I've never seen people
[49:29.960 --> 49:35.860]  with a bigger chip on their shoulder in life than lacrosse players. Like they wake up every day
[49:35.860 --> 49:41.140]  angry that the world doesn't respect their sport and understand it. And they go to bed every night
[49:41.140 --> 49:44.940]  wanting to fight somebody over it. Like that that is a group of people you don't want to piss
[49:44.940 --> 49:49.820]  off because they are spared. Itching to prove to you that lacrosse is a tough guy sport.
[49:50.380 --> 49:54.980]  I I don't doubt that it's a tough guy sport. I think the problem is that there's no
[49:55.440 --> 50:00.620]  like the exciting moments stuff isn't very exciting. Like there's no odds.
[50:01.240 --> 50:04.940]  I'm not defending it at all. I totally agree with you. I'm just saying that's a bunch of people
[50:05.600 --> 50:09.780]  I've met that as a rule as a generally are just angry about how people view their sport.
[50:10.060 --> 50:13.720]  I feel like the sport would be much more interesting if the ball glowed.
[50:13.720 --> 50:17.060]  I feel like it's too small to see. Yeah, something like that. That's good.
[50:17.760 --> 50:21.440]  And I don't mean this to be rude to people we know that play the other sports,
[50:21.880 --> 50:25.760]  but lacrosse and ultimate are like the same kind of thing to me, where it's just like it's really
[50:25.760 --> 50:32.440]  hard to look at it and get excited, I guess. Yeah, I had to photograph a lot of lacrosse
[50:32.440 --> 50:37.040]  matches in the army. And yeah, it's just I'm right there with you. It didn't do it for me.
[50:37.100 --> 50:40.540]  But I also recognize that those dudes are like I wouldn't say that to a lacrosse player's face
[50:40.540 --> 50:46.420]  because they either yell at you for an hour or fight you. Is there a sport that would be
[50:47.000 --> 50:51.480]  lessened by having the ball glow? I feel like the ball glowing would improve every sport.
[50:52.780 --> 50:58.200]  That'd be fucking awesome. I feel like it works for sports where the ball is small,
[50:58.200 --> 51:03.560]  like tennis, it would help out. No, I want to see like on a like a soccer kick,
[51:03.680 --> 51:07.720]  like a Rocket League like tail, you know, like when you boost. Yeah, I love that on the ball.
[51:08.260 --> 51:14.520]  This is awesome. Or if like golf balls really did the thing where if you watch golf or like they do
[51:14.520 --> 51:20.180]  the tail on it, like if that was just a natural occurring process of hitting the ball, like if
[51:20.180 --> 51:26.360]  you could have tracer rounds on golf balls like you do on bullets. Yes. Oh, man, I would be I
[51:26.360 --> 51:31.120]  would watch so much more golf every time. Every time you hit a golf ball, it's like
[51:32.440 --> 51:37.720]  even on like a smaller scale, like a pinball machine with that pinballs with that flying
[51:37.720 --> 51:45.440]  around. Oh. Yeah. Every sport would be improved. What sport would be improved by going the opposite
[51:45.440 --> 51:52.660]  direction and making the ball harder to see? Football. Dodgeball. If the dodgeball was like
[51:52.660 --> 51:56.540]  a mirror, like if you couldn't see it, like it's yeah, if it's like a mirror like that,
[51:56.620 --> 52:01.480]  like that wavy invisibility cloaking technology we have now where it's mostly invisible,
[52:01.840 --> 52:05.020]  but you kind of get a shimmer, you know, all the people that are polishing their
[52:05.020 --> 52:11.960]  Cybertrucks to a mirror finish, not realizing that it makes their car just completely invisible.
[52:13.540 --> 52:17.460]  People are going to be going around a corner and then driving into their own car
[52:17.460 --> 52:18.940]  before they realize what's happened.
[52:21.280 --> 52:27.240]  It would be funny to like test with each sport what what size of ball makes it unplayable
[52:27.240 --> 52:33.000]  both ways. At what point does it being too small make it impossible? And what point does it being
[52:33.000 --> 52:40.040]  so big? It just you can't you can't score like I think it's in my head imagining like a rugby scrum
[52:40.040 --> 52:44.440]  where they can't see the ball and they're still scrumming like five yards away from where the
[52:44.440 --> 52:49.600]  ball actually is. Very funny. Or like if a basketball was the size of a medicine ball,
[52:49.860 --> 52:54.340]  but still bounced and shit and worked like a basketball. That'd be dangerous. Yeah.
[53:00.800 --> 53:05.060]  It would be pandemonium. You imagine getting hit with one of those? Jesus. Oh,
[53:05.140 --> 53:08.940]  terrible. Trying to miss it and miss time in a rebound and hitting the fucking. Oh, God.
[53:10.280 --> 53:15.620]  What a way to protest Steph Curry. Just giving him a fucking boulder to try to shoot threes with.
[53:16.180 --> 53:19.900]  Just making it impossible. Just making it a literal boulder to throw.
[53:20.460 --> 53:25.980]  Bring back the dunk era. Everybody in the paint. I think tip of the shuttlecock
[53:25.980 --> 53:31.700]  glowing would be cool. That would be cool. I bet that exists. Yeah, but it does. What
[53:31.700 --> 53:37.560]  if you drove a cyber truck into your wall and then use that to shave, use the reflection?
[53:40.060 --> 53:44.680]  Dude, there are so many glow in the dark shuttlecocks. Wow. Yeah, but it looks like
[53:44.680 --> 53:49.060]  not the tip that glows. It looks like it's the whole thing. You're right. And then also it looks
[53:49.060 --> 53:54.180]  like it's the only part that doesn't glow is the tip. Is the tip. Yeah. Who do you think of
[53:54.180 --> 54:02.680]  the regulation crew? That's great. Who do you think is the best badminton player? Me. Right now? I
[54:02.680 --> 54:09.080]  used to play all the time as a kid. Yeah, I was a pretty big player. Jeff says him. See, I'm thinking
[54:09.080 --> 54:14.980]  I could just wipe the floor with a lawyer. Oh, probably. Probably. This one has a glowing tip.
[54:15.180 --> 54:20.940]  There you go. That's what we're looking for because others, they glow on skirt, not hitting spot. And
[54:20.940 --> 54:27.260]  I agree. That's right. That's right. Should we have a badminton tournament? I think so. We can.
[54:28.540 --> 54:34.680]  I don't think it would be that hard to set up. Can you play on like a regular volleyball net
[54:34.680 --> 54:41.060]  or is it like a lower net? I don't remember. I think it's lower. I think we just buy a kit
[54:41.060 --> 54:44.940]  and throw it in the like, take it down to Zilker Park, probably. But it needs to be regulation
[54:44.940 --> 54:49.900]  height. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like Walmart. You can get like a twenty dollar kit pretty easily.
[54:50.560 --> 54:56.000]  Okay. Yeah, yeah. It was good to know. Oh, 80 bucks. Here you go. Do we want to do doubles?
[54:56.100 --> 55:00.060]  Oh, that's more than I thought. Yeah, I think two v two. And then the winning team goes head
[55:00.060 --> 55:05.560]  like that's how you do it. Oh, wow. All right. That's pretty good. I have to turn. That's great.
[55:05.580 --> 55:10.620]  So how are we filming the two v two? I, you know, tripod, I don't know, get a fucking
[55:11.060 --> 55:14.320]  piece of wood and nail it to a desk and put a hammer on it.
[55:16.400 --> 55:24.240]  When all you got to hammer every solution, man, I get it. Yeah. Oh, dude. Here's a here's a
[55:24.240 --> 55:30.900]  awesome setup for this. I was pitching Eric, you guys doing like a summer video,
[55:31.580 --> 55:37.060]  and this feels like it would fit in that very well. Yeah. It started with me wondering if you
[55:37.060 --> 55:42.500]  could fire condiments out of a super soaker. Mm hmm. Is the idea of like Nick just walking
[55:42.500 --> 55:48.340]  around shooting condiments on like hot dogs? It's really funny to me. I like that idea and I want
[55:48.340 --> 55:52.940]  to follow through. I want to follow up on that. But I have a question. I have a question. Do you
[55:52.940 --> 55:57.880]  think you're a better badminton player in the daytime or at night? Because we can do it both
[55:57.880 --> 56:05.220]  ways. We we know they have the technology. Does the net light up? Yeah, they make it light up,
[56:05.280 --> 56:10.420]  actually, they do. Can you get that glow in the dark paint? And then paint the field that way?
[56:10.460 --> 56:15.080]  The lines? Because you have lines. Oh, yeah. We just rent some UV lights and make the most
[56:16.260 --> 56:21.600]  glowing badminton game the world's ever seen. Or you could just go to a park during the day and
[56:21.600 --> 56:25.980]  do all that work and then set up a net and play. I think that's probably. I mean, either way,
[56:26.000 --> 56:30.420]  we're nailing wood to a desk to film it. Yeah. Yeah. See, that's easy. Look at that.
[56:31.220 --> 56:37.460]  Now, is there like a halftime shave break for this game? Yeah. Do you think you're do you think
[56:37.460 --> 56:41.720]  you're better with a beard or without? Oh, definitely without. Less weight, more air,
[56:41.800 --> 56:48.680]  move faster. Yeah. I like this. I think I think Gavin might be the best player,
[56:48.680 --> 56:53.240]  but I think Nick and Eric would be Jeff and Gavin. You think Nick and Eric are going to
[56:53.240 --> 56:59.920]  beat Gavin? Oh, I will. I should tell you this. I once lost miserably to Jack at tennis. Oh,
[57:00.100 --> 57:04.340]  OK. Well, that really shifts things a lot. But tennis is very different.
[57:04.860 --> 57:10.400]  What? When? When was this? Oh, seven or eight years ago, maybe. Oh, OK. Never mind. I've
[57:10.400 --> 57:15.340]  shifted things a lot. Yeah. Now, Eric, is this going to be this is going to be face off season
[57:15.340 --> 57:22.860]  one is what I'm imagining at this point. Going to be Eric, Nick. And I think I think Nick will win.
[57:24.580 --> 57:29.240]  Oh, Andrew's early predictions are that Nick takes it. OK. Fucked up, but hell yeah.
[57:30.580 --> 57:36.360]  I think Nick will want it more. I think ultimately Eric won't care about winning in the same way Nick
[57:36.360 --> 57:42.200]  will. And the fact that you have a kid, Nick, I feel like just gives you an edge. I feel like
[57:42.200 --> 57:47.460]  you're probably running around more than Eric is just by nature of having a child.
[57:47.480 --> 57:52.620]  Yeah. Do you think caring about winning is the differentiator? Because if that's the case,
[57:52.640 --> 57:56.800]  I promise you I care more about winning than all of you put together. Oh, I don't know about that.
[57:56.960 --> 58:01.460]  Yeah, but yeah, but at some point there's a skill gap. You know what I mean? Yeah, that's that is
[58:01.460 --> 58:08.220]  all I'll say is I hit badminton like I hit dingers. You know what? That is a great point by you. I
[58:08.220 --> 58:12.660]  greatly underestimated your hitting ability. That's great, man. I guess if we're playing
[58:12.660 --> 58:18.780]  badminton for distance, you're going to be crushing it. Listen, I was hitting home runs
[58:18.780 --> 58:22.840]  because that's what the job was to do. If you wanted me to hit line drives across the first
[58:22.840 --> 58:30.220]  place, I've done that. I'm not all power. I'm just imagining Jeff is like a tennis guy who
[58:30.220 --> 58:36.560]  only goes for aces, like full power every serve. But is it accurate enough to do that?
[58:37.120 --> 58:41.200]  Oh, man. I'm bummed that we're not going to record next week.
[58:42.660 --> 58:48.080]  Yeah. Oh, Jeff won't. We'll be recording stuff. Yeah, I mean, well, yeah, yeah, yeah. But you know,
[58:48.600 --> 58:52.640]  Jeff not being here. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if you guys feel this way. I feel like Jeff
[58:52.640 --> 58:58.360]  is pretty crucial to what we're doing, but you know. Definitely. Oh, absolutely. I'm just saying
[58:58.360 --> 59:01.600]  we're going to record. It's not like Gavin was pretty silent when I said that. That's all I'm
[59:01.600 --> 59:08.580]  saying. I appreciate the partial gas up from Andrew and Eric. Thank you. I feel loved and
[59:08.580 --> 59:17.980]  important. And also bad that I'm denying you me for a week. I didn't say that. That's what I got
[59:17.980 --> 59:23.880]  out of it, essentially, is that you're missing the gift of Jeff for a week. I feel bad about that.
[59:24.400 --> 59:30.780]  If you want, I can call throughout the week periodically. I have a lawn question.
[59:32.480 --> 59:35.280]  Why? Why did all my clippings rot?
[59:37.440 --> 59:44.320]  Why did dead grass rot? It went all white and fluffy, like mold. Probably molded. Wait,
[59:44.480 --> 59:51.780]  what? It went white? Yeah, it went white and fluffy. It disturbed me. And then I was worried
[59:51.780 --> 59:56.840]  that when I put more grass on top in the bin, that it would blow up all the spores of weird
[59:56.840 --> 01:00:04.460]  shit in my face. Are you scared of becoming a clicker? Yeah. Or are we worried about spores?
[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:12.500]  I've just never seen plants go moldy. Well, I mean, it's 100 degrees outside and all the grass
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:17.420]  is probably wet when you cut it, so it's all damp. It's got to be mildew, right? It's just
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:22.060]  mildewing. And then you stick it in a hot box and put a lid on it. It doesn't have anywhere
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:26.360]  for the moisture to escape. And then you don't put it out for anyone to take away?
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:30.680]  Yeah, you leave it for a whole extra week. Do you think it's going to kill me,
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:34.920]  though? Or am I safe to live near it? Can I be honest with you? I think it's probably too late.
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:42.280]  Yeah. You didn't happen to shave near it, did you? I wish to God you'd asked this question yesterday.
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:49.300]  Is it next to the wall mushroom? Or is it in a different area?
[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:54.720]  The slime, you mean? Yeah, whatever. You know, your house is fucked.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:06.600]  It's true! We found out about his wall-hung TV that he can't move and there's like a lot going
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:11.900]  on. Yeah, the guy told him if he moves his wall-mounted TV, it'll fall off the wall.
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:18.580]  Yeah, look, nothing's great, but I'm making do, all right? I'm so fucking glad I don't own a house
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:26.420]  anymore. Oh man, this must have been what it was like for y'all for the first, like, two years of
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:31.340]  the podcast. Yeah. When I was trying to get shelves installed. You know what else isn't great? What?
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:38.740]  Horizon. Horizon, a Wild West story. Quiet Place, day one, killing it. It's gonna have a big week.
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:47.900]  $50 million weekend? $800k? Oh no. That's almost a million dollars. It's close. Oh, cool, buddy!
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:52.280]  You had a million dollars right now. If somebody gave you $800,000 right now, you'd be so fucking
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:56.500]  blown away. Yeah, I agree. And if I was Kevin Costner and doing that, I'd be real bummed out.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:02.180]  I don't think, I think $800,000 is $800,000. Now they bring up that it's not like the audience for
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:07.480]  that is going to the Thursday night showings by large. Yeah. I would love to know who,
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:11.480]  like, who is the hardcore, the hardcore that has to go to the fucking midnight premiere
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:17.180]  of Horizon? Everybody knows chew cowboys go to bed when the sun goes down.
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:23.660]  I keep wanting to call it Forbidden West, but that's the, the other, that's the sequel to
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:29.820]  the mech game. But I just feel like it fits that story. What is it called? Horizon,
[01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:34.900]  a Western tale? What is it? Horizon Forbidden West. Is that a mech game? I just installed it.
[01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:41.340]  That is what's going to happen. People are going to be like, Oh, I should see that. And they won't
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:47.480]  get around to it until they accidentally see part two. And then, then it will add to my tool.
[01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:54.620]  Ooh, this is a, there's a something in the article there. I just put it in there. Critical reviews
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:03:01.520]  for a Horizon stand at 41% on Rotten Tomatoes, which isn't as bad as Costner's The Postman at
[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:08.340]  14%. Though it is below the Waterworld's 47%. Are you telling me that this movie is essentially
[01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:14.300]  as good as Waterworld? Chuching! We've got ourselves a barn burner. It's going to build
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:21.340]  all summer long. Titanic 2.0. Here we go. I'm fucking pumped. I cannot wait for the Horizon
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:30.560]  ride to continue on for many years. It'll just be like Westworld. It'll, it'll just be
[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:36.860]  people killing Indians and it's just Wild West. Do we have a running total to read out or anything?
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:42.540]  Uh, I could, I could pull it up. What everyone's at? I feel like people appreciate it. I do. I got,
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:46.600]  I got an update of the running total. Gavin is crushing it right now, unfortunately. Gavin
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:56.700]  currently at $554 million. Uh, Jeff has $123 million in second. Eric has $108 million in third.
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:03.920]  I have $105 million in fourth. So we're all kind of close. And then Nick currently with $13 million
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:09.640]  in fifth place. He's going to catch up hard and fast though. He's got that despicable me coming.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:15.220]  Yeah. He's got minions or whatever. Like it's about to go crazy. Well, blue lock episode Nagi releases
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:20.160]  today for Nick. So that's, that's going to be big draw. All right. Count those dollars, baby.
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.620]  I bet it does better than horizon.
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:31.380]  Is it just me or are you guys getting ads for fly me to the moon that Scarlett Johansson,
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:36.720]  Channing Tatum movie? I'm getting them all the time. So many ads for it, dude. I'm glad it's not
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:43.680]  just me. It looks like a fake movie that 30 rock made. It does not look like a real film. I can't
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:48.840]  believe it. I have it. And I, I don't like, I felt like it would be a small like romantic comedy,
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:53.260]  but they are pushing it like a summer blockbuster that in a way that I think is odd.
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:57.820]  So I just wanted to make sure that I somehow didn't fuck my algorithm because I own it and
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:03.740]  have looked into it. I'm glad you're also in the same boat, Eric. Yeah, I do. Yeah. I bought it for
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:10.560]  a whole four points. Oh, I've been trying to figure out a way to iterate on this idea and so
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:15.220]  that we can do it again. And a lot of people have been submitting ideas to us. And I've seen a bunch
[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:21.360]  Andrew's got a whole list, but I, I did land on something. We've been talking about wanting to do
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:25.960]  something with the Olympics. Right. And we had talked about maybe like throwing all the countries,
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.420]  except for our countries into a, into a, like a bingo thing and pulling out and then like three
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:35.100]  each. And then those are the company countries we support. And then I don't know, maybe rooting for
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:39.940]  them on a live stream or something. But I, I, I was thinking about how countries collect metals
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:44.340]  and there's like the metal race, you know, at the end of the day, it would be interesting if
[01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:49.360]  we collected or we did something like that. But then the goal was to see how many metals the
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:55.300]  countries we collected or we, we picked got. And then if we could use that currency down the road
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:59.780]  in some way that made sense. That's fun. Yeah. I did that sort of with the last Olympics where I,
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:05.820]  I bet the over on every single country, these Olympic metal count. And I think I came out like
[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:11.800]  positive 50 cents. I made equal bets across each for like a dollar. Really? There's one country
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:17.720]  that was not expected to win too. It was one and a half was the line. And I got it because they
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:22.700]  shockingly won like some swimming thing when they're only expected to win a medal in boxing.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:26.920]  But yeah, that's fun. Oh, we'll figure something out. It just, it would be funny if one day we
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.380]  were just like six months from now. You were like, you know what? Uh, actually we are going
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:33.300]  to do that. And I'm going to spend my, I'm going to spend three Chinese gold medals on it. And
[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:37.680]  somebody, everybody's like, I forgot you had those. We can't say no. You know, it's got to
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:45.520]  be a better way to kind of phrase any of that. That's really China as a country. They get a lot
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:49.500]  of medals. It just feels like a weird fit. I just, the way you said it just feels weird to me.
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:54.500]  That's all. That's all. All right. I did. I'm going to spend three Italian gold medals on it.
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:01.040]  They spent, they spend the same as Chinese gold medals, but for some reason they they're
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:08.720]  different to Eric. Mama Mia. I like having seasons with these types of things. So I was
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:13.940]  thinking like when the movie season ends, that's when NFL season begins and doing something where
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:19.740]  like we have a kicker draft because Gavin loves football, which is a foot sport. If we do like
[01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:25.080]  an auction of kickers and your goal is to have the most or least field goals, I haven't decided
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:30.720]  which are better, but like we just run through every kicker and we have to bet on them. Like
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:36.840]  we're heavily, heavily invested in the NFL season, but only from the standpoint of kickers.
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:46.140]  I love that idea. How do you pick them? I would spend two silvers and a gold medal from a country
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:51.140]  of your choice to approve that. That's good. That's good. See, see, you say it like that
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:55.820]  and it's fine. I just, if you say like I'm spending three Polish gold medals, it just,
[01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:59.260]  I'm telling you, it sounds, it's not good. It just sounds weird. That's all.
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:06.000]  But it isn't actually weird. I, I understand. I'm just, I'm trying to get the optics so that
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.700]  way you're aware. That's all. We also could use it for sloppy Joe's bingo, I thought would be fun.
[01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:15.780]  Wow. Lay out all the options that you get to buy your bingo card.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:23.660]  Does like pink taxi go for like 70 points because it's more probable? Although those aren't, those
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:27.820]  haven't been around as much recently. I'm not putting anything in a wheelchair. I'll tell you
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:33.600]  that fucking much. We should wrap up. We should, we should wrap up. We should also plan a sloppy
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:38.380]  Joe's bingo soon. We should seem to do one of those. Let's do, let's do one soon. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:43.080]  I think this is good. We'll get it on the calendar. All right. Well, I guess that'll do it then.
[01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:49.900]  A rare Friday recording. How did everybody feel about this one? I liked it. One of my favorites.
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:55.520]  One of your favorites? I was going to say, uh, kind of, I kind of liked the energy level of it.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:59.960]  Just kind of like chill. It was a chill episode. I feel like. I don't, I don't know if that's how
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:05.300]  I'd phrase it, but I loved it. That's how I felt. Oh, I had one minor outburst because I was mad
[01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:09.680]  about the post office, but other than that, it was really chill. I think it started pretty high octane
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:18.480]  and then I got really tired from laughing. Ended on a, ended on a chill note. That was nice.
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:24.660]  Speaking of ending, uh, your time listening to this podcast has come to a close. At least this
[01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:29.300]  episode. Now that doesn't mean you can't listen to any more. We've got hundreds of back episodes
[01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:34.880]  from a previous podcast we did before our company was, uh, shut down out from under us. And we were,
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:41.340]  uh, you know, allowed and, and, uh, supported and encouraged to start anew, which is what
[01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:45.900]  we've done. And we would like you to continue the journey with us by going to our website
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:52.640]  that Gavin loves to say. Regulatrion.com. You were, by the way, Gavin, right on top of that.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:57.320]  Thank you so much. You really thought you were going to say it. Why would I say I,
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:07.520]  why would I set you? We'll see you next time. I can actually buy singular nails. That's awesome.
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:14.240]  How much is one nail? 53 cents. It's the cost of highway robbery. You're getting ripped off.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:19.020]  Uh, but it's for six inch, eight inch, a dollar five. I don't think I need it. Oh,
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:24.700]  do I need eight inch? You do not need an eight inch nail. I think you got to get sick. That's
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:29.280]  six extra inches. Plus you're buying a two by four and I got news for you. A two by four. Isn't two
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:35.040]  by four. It's one and a half by three and a half. So you really don't need that much. I'm going to
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:44.380]  buy three nails. Awesome. All right. We'll see you next time. Bye. Bye. First practice is almost
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:49.780]  here. Gear up on budget. When you shop quality used sports equipment at play it again, sports
[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:55.940]  plus get paid on the spot for outgrown items. It's the sustainable way to shop and sell for football,
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:01.780]  soccer, golf, hockey, and more. Play it again sports. Your back to school go-to.
