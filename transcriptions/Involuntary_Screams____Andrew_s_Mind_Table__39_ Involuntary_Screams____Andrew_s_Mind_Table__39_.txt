[00:01.640 --> 00:05.300]  Tim collects bobbleheads. A lot of bobbleheads.
[00:05.640 --> 00:08.340]  Baseball bobbleheads. Race car bobbleheads.
[00:08.660 --> 00:10.140]  Little chihuahua bobbleheads.
[00:10.480 --> 00:13.220]  He's got an entire room strictly for bobbleheads.
[00:13.660 --> 00:14.900]  Does he need them? No.
[00:15.100 --> 00:17.040]  Is his wife mad about it? A little.
[00:17.280 --> 00:19.920]  But Tim works with Empower and he got good at money.
[00:20.200 --> 00:21.560]  So he can be a little bad.
[00:21.900 --> 00:24.600]  Ooh, horse bobblehead. Classy, Tim.
[00:25.180 --> 00:27.500]  Empower. Invest well, live a little.
[00:27.780 --> 00:29.200]  Start today at Empower.com.
[00:30.100 --> 00:33.340]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:33.500 --> 00:34.780]  This is episode 39.
[00:35.300 --> 00:38.060]  My name is Jeff Ramsey and with me as always
[00:38.060 --> 00:40.560]  Andrew, Eric, Nick, and Gavin
[00:40.560 --> 00:43.260]  as they are colloquially known.
[00:43.680 --> 00:45.700]  However, we're going to pick nicknames soon
[00:45.700 --> 00:47.780]  and I guess we'll have to go by our new monikers.
[00:48.260 --> 00:48.480]  Ooh!
[00:49.500 --> 00:51.660]  So how is that working again?
[00:51.780 --> 00:53.040]  So we're doing a nickname draft.
[00:53.140 --> 00:54.240]  We're going to record it tomorrow.
[00:54.940 --> 00:57.420]  We're all picking one nickname for each of us.
[00:57.420 --> 00:59.880]  Then how is the ultimate nickname being decided?
[00:59.920 --> 01:02.440]  Do we pick that? I don't think you should be able to pick that.
[01:02.760 --> 01:03.900]  How's that going to work?
[01:04.140 --> 01:05.840]  You don't get to select your own nickname.
[01:06.280 --> 01:06.380]  Yes.
[01:08.300 --> 01:10.420]  So we all select nicknames for each other
[01:10.420 --> 01:12.420]  and then you're at the mercy of the wheel.
[01:12.820 --> 01:13.900]  Oh, great.
[01:14.080 --> 01:17.040]  Your four nicknames go on the wheel and the wheel gets spun.
[01:17.460 --> 01:19.060]  Are we each bringing one for everybody?
[01:19.600 --> 01:20.220]  Is that how that works?
[01:20.420 --> 01:21.680]  Yeah, everyone but yourself.
[01:22.040 --> 01:23.080]  Are you guys getting mean?
[01:23.480 --> 01:24.640]  I'm not going to tell you where I'm getting.
[01:24.640 --> 01:25.500]  I would like to not.
[01:25.500 --> 01:26.920]  Okay, Andrew's going to get mean. Cool.
[01:27.720 --> 01:30.280]  Andrew already got mean on Mr. Thomas.
[01:30.580 --> 01:31.720]  No, he got spicy.
[01:32.220 --> 01:32.920]  No, I went spicy.
[01:33.580 --> 01:37.660]  But can I give you one of my scrap names that I had?
[01:37.700 --> 01:40.080]  I had a nickname for Gavin that I really liked,
[01:40.120 --> 01:42.600]  but it has his partner's name in it.
[01:42.960 --> 01:43.940]  So I had to get rid of it.
[01:44.380 --> 01:44.760]  Nutmeg.
[01:48.100 --> 01:48.980]  Jesus Christ.
[01:51.440 --> 01:52.900]  How does that work?
[01:52.980 --> 01:55.880]  I was thinking because you've been squirrely recently.
[01:55.880 --> 01:57.280]  You've been a little bit of a menace.
[01:57.400 --> 02:00.560]  And I was like, what feels like a squirrel nut vibe?
[02:00.700 --> 02:01.360]  And Nutmeg.
[02:01.760 --> 02:03.240]  And I thought, Meg's name is in it.
[02:03.420 --> 02:05.140]  I can't do it.
[02:05.440 --> 02:08.400]  So it's just a coincidence that one of my nuts went bad?
[02:08.940 --> 02:09.260]  Yes.
[02:09.780 --> 02:11.260]  Didn't even think about that.
[02:11.520 --> 02:12.580]  Wow, that's a great nickname.
[02:12.880 --> 02:15.420]  I was really focused in on the squirrel aspect of it.
[02:15.420 --> 02:16.040]  Hey, Gav.
[02:16.440 --> 02:16.620]  Yeah.
[02:16.860 --> 02:18.480]  Maybe stop living in the past, okay?
[02:19.140 --> 02:19.800]  It's true.
[02:19.860 --> 02:22.060]  That was almost 20 years ago.
[02:22.480 --> 02:25.280]  20 years ago?
[02:25.280 --> 02:27.880]  You know you've had an injured nut for 20 years?
[02:28.540 --> 02:31.320]  Uh, what'd it be? 18 years ago? Yeah, 2007.
[02:31.660 --> 02:36.940]  Have you ever done anything in that gap where you're like, man, this would be easier if I had a 100% nut on the other side?
[02:37.440 --> 02:39.880]  Well, I would say I'm back at 100% nut.
[02:40.240 --> 02:40.580]  Really?
[02:41.260 --> 02:41.640]  Yeah.
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.400]  Yeah, like both nuts work perfectly, right?
[02:44.440 --> 02:46.660]  It's just one is stapled to the side of your body.
[02:47.920 --> 02:50.300]  It's not stapled to my body, it's stapled to the sack.
[02:50.560 --> 02:51.680]  Is the sack part of your body?
[02:52.400 --> 02:54.640]  Yeah, but you always describe it to other people.
[02:55.740 --> 02:58.260]  You always describe it to other people like someone stapled it to my leg.
[02:58.360 --> 03:01.260]  That's exactly what it sounded like to me. I thought it was stapled to your leg when you said that.
[03:01.260 --> 03:04.300]  It's not stapled to your sack, whatever. It's stapled to you. It said you stapled to you.
[03:04.860 --> 03:06.420]  I didn't say it was stapled to your foot or anything.
[03:06.860 --> 03:09.280]  I mean, I don't know if it makes the, uh, the sperm.
[03:10.100 --> 03:14.540]  I don't know if they could test a jizz and know which one came from which bollock.
[03:19.080 --> 03:22.180]  Do little jizzes have like nut fingerprints on them?
[03:22.680 --> 03:23.540]  I don't think so.
[03:24.780 --> 03:27.720]  There's not like a bunch of lefts and rights swinging around?
[03:27.740 --> 03:31.080]  You can tell which receptacle it came from? I don't think so.
[03:31.480 --> 03:33.280]  Right bollock, left bollock? That's very...
[03:34.840 --> 03:36.140]  Right bollock more creative?
[03:38.000 --> 03:38.480]  Whatever.
[03:38.480 --> 03:44.440]  Yeah, like Jeff, you have only one kid, so you've only succeeded with one boll so far.
[03:44.660 --> 03:50.020]  Yeah, that's a good point. And then I snipped it, so now it doesn't really... now I can't do it again.
[03:51.020 --> 03:55.720]  She's left-handed, so I don't know if that plays any part in it.
[03:56.160 --> 03:57.240]  Nick says same here.
[03:57.620 --> 03:59.200]  Yeah, I got the old snip.
[03:59.880 --> 04:05.460]  Yeah, Nick's fixed. Nick and I got fixed. We got spayed or neutered, whichever one's appropriate for us.
[04:05.880 --> 04:07.320]  I thought Nick was agreeing he was left-handed.
[04:07.740 --> 04:09.100]  I completely misread that.
[04:09.300 --> 04:14.240]  If you took one of my bolls, whose kids would you be having?
[04:14.700 --> 04:15.920]  Oh, that's an interesting question.
[04:16.360 --> 04:20.520]  Yeah, like if you just had someone else's boll put on, does it start making their kids or the boll's kids?
[04:21.540 --> 04:22.840]  Ooh, I don't know.
[04:23.160 --> 04:25.000]  That's... yeah, I'm too dumb for this.
[04:25.440 --> 04:25.800]  Oh!
[04:26.160 --> 04:30.280]  Because it would be pretty cool to have one of your own and one of someone else's, and then it's just kind of a potluck.
[04:30.880 --> 04:31.440]  Like a split?
[04:31.480 --> 04:34.800]  You know what? Where do babies come from? Is that the title of this episode?
[04:34.800 --> 04:47.620]  This is an awesome way to segue into something that happened to me Monday night that I have been horrified and dying to tell you guys,
[04:47.640 --> 04:54.420]  because it's kind of related to what we're talking about in some ways, and it has left me a shaken person.
[04:55.640 --> 05:01.540]  Monday night, I was laying in bed watching TV with my wife, just laying on top of the covers in my jammies,
[05:01.540 --> 05:06.680]  because she was going to go to sleep after we finished watching Silo or whatever, and I was going to get up and play Call of Duty.
[05:07.320 --> 05:15.400]  And the dog, he sleeps in bed with us, he's pretty good, again, he's regained his bed privileges, and so he's pretty rad, he's pretty rad.
[05:15.500 --> 05:19.300]  He's getting... a lot of the puppy is leaving him and he's just becoming a good sleepy bulldog.
[05:19.860 --> 05:28.040]  But he brought his hockey stick up into bed with him so that he had something to chew on, he's got this little Detroit Red Wings hockey stick, we got him.
[05:28.040 --> 05:34.640]  And he likes to be touching me at all times, Albert does. At all times, he likes to be touching me.
[05:35.060 --> 05:42.700]  And it's annoying, because a lot of times he'll be chewing on something right next to my thigh, and I'll just get sopping wet from slobber and shit.
[05:43.720 --> 05:47.240]  But you just learn to deal with it, right? You kind of get numb to it.
[05:47.660 --> 05:54.540]  And so, he climbs kind of on top of me, and he drops the hockey stick in my lap, and I went,
[05:54.540 --> 06:10.060]  Well, that's not where you should be chewing that. And I went, Hey, but, and right as I did, right as I said that, he bit me so hard, fully on the dick, that it changed my life in an instant.
[06:10.500 --> 06:19.280]  I have never in my life felt a pain like that. Like, I've never been shocked alert more quickly.
[06:20.140 --> 06:25.620]  And he had my dick in his mouth for a couple seconds there, because he was like, What? And I'm like, What?
[06:26.240 --> 06:35.180]  And he bit my dick head and my shaft, about halfway down the shaft. I have never felt a bruising like that.
[06:35.400 --> 06:41.080]  Like, he didn't break the skin or anything, but I went, I screamed, I went, My dick! Like that.
[06:41.920 --> 06:55.400]  Emily goes, What? And I go, He bit my dick! Oh my God! And I jumped up, and I just grabbed my dick with both hands, and I ran around the upstairs for like, I don't know, 90 seconds, not knowing what to do.
[06:55.540 --> 07:04.660]  I was just in blinding pain, and I didn't know if my dick had been ripped off. I didn't know if I was covered in blood. I couldn't look down because I was too scared.
[07:04.820 --> 07:08.320]  I didn't feel wet. You know, I didn't feel blood in my hands, so I thought that was a good sign.
[07:08.320 --> 07:14.220]  But I genuinely, it hurt so unbelievably bad. I just didn't know, and I was scared to find out.
[07:14.440 --> 07:19.900]  So after like 90 seconds of running around in circles, I finally looked down, and my dick was still there, and I was fine.
[07:19.980 --> 07:28.760]  But it was sore for three days. Was it worse than the toilet seat? Yeah, way worse than the toilet seat.
[07:28.940 --> 07:36.500]  Oh my God. Because it was sharp and hard. Did you punish him? Yeah, did you put Albert in the penalty box?
[07:37.840 --> 07:42.460]  No, that's not his fault. Did you like do it back to him, so that way he knows what it feels like?
[07:43.680 --> 07:51.180]  No, it was an accident. My little buddy didn't mean to. But yeah, it was one of the worst moments of recent memory.
[07:51.580 --> 08:00.560]  And I recommend fully not doing that. If you ever get a chance to not be bitten by a dog on your dick, do your best not to be bitten by a dog on your dick.
[08:00.560 --> 08:11.940]  It is always bad when you scream completely involuntarily. I did it on a plane maybe a year ago, where I screamed in someone's face completely out of my control.
[08:12.000 --> 08:20.100]  Just like they pooped you? No, I just had my hand on the armrest, and someone just bashed their bag into my little finger.
[08:20.100 --> 08:33.160]  And it hurt so much, I just went... and then I was like, I'm sorry. I apologized for screaming. It was just shot out. And it made the person next to me jump.
[08:34.900 --> 08:41.180]  Made me jump a little bit. I think they thought I was a psycho. It just came out of me because it crushed my little finger.
[08:42.040 --> 08:47.340]  That sounds terrible. How long did it hurt for? Oh, maybe like two seconds.
[08:49.460 --> 08:57.840]  It was instantly fine, but it just... Do you think the yelling was longer than the pain? I think the yelling was the exact same length as the pain.
[09:00.840 --> 09:08.500]  That makes it even worse because then you come out of the yell pain-free. It just makes it awkward. Like it came and it left immediately.
[09:08.500 --> 09:19.100]  Oh, man. Albert, is he a Red Wings guy? He seems to be, yeah. He's pretty into that hockey stick.
[09:20.020 --> 09:24.720]  That makes me really happy, imagining him just running around with a hockey stick. Cross-checking.
[09:25.680 --> 09:32.900]  I will say he's more of a hockey dog than a basketball dog. He tends to favor his hockey toys more than his basketball toys.
[09:33.580 --> 09:37.600]  I have a little Celtics hot dog for him. He's not into it at all anymore.
[09:38.080 --> 09:48.120]  I was talking about Albert and biting your dick in penalty boxes. Outside of hockey, are there other sports where you can accidentally get penalties?
[09:49.300 --> 09:55.300]  Like you can get a penalty, not like doing something unintentionally can get you penalized? Football?
[09:55.980 --> 09:59.240]  But that's like an act of intent. You know what I mean? What's the intent?
[10:00.020 --> 10:05.640]  Like you're trying to... I guess it would be the same. How is it an accident in hockey but not an accident in basketball?
[10:05.640 --> 10:09.880]  If you shoot the puck clear over the glass, you get penalized.
[10:10.340 --> 10:16.540]  Well, in soccer football, if the goalkeeper touches the ball outside the box, it's a penalty.
[10:17.620 --> 10:18.120]  Interesting. Okay.
[10:18.360 --> 10:21.500]  It's not an actual penalty. I think it just gets sent off or something.
[10:21.640 --> 10:31.300]  I mean, in American football, you go to tackle a guy, your hand might slip and you grab a face mask or you pull him down by the back of the jersey, like horse collar. Those aren't typically intentional.
[10:31.840 --> 10:35.160]  In basketball, if you accidentally elbow somebody in the head, that's a foul.
[10:35.160 --> 10:40.800]  Whether you did it on purpose or not. And a lot of times, you're not even looking in the same direction when it happens.
[10:40.800 --> 10:44.320]  I mean, Jeff, I gotta say, not after the sports improvements draft, it's not.
[10:46.680 --> 10:54.360]  I'm very excited about the sports improvement draft. I came up with one last night while I was watching the Celtics game that I cannot fucking wait to jump into.
[10:54.980 --> 10:55.500]  That's great.
[10:55.740 --> 10:57.980]  Are we doing that Friday as well or is that something else?
[10:58.300 --> 11:00.880]  We are. We're doing nickname draft and sports improvement draft.
[11:01.260 --> 11:01.560]  Awesome.
[11:01.800 --> 11:02.320]  I have a question.
[11:02.740 --> 11:03.140]  Go for it.
[11:03.320 --> 11:04.460]  Why don't we make better helium?
[11:05.120 --> 11:06.600]  Aren't we almost out of helium?
[11:06.780 --> 11:09.740]  Do we make? Are we making helium?
[11:09.960 --> 11:11.780]  I don't know anything about helium.
[11:12.240 --> 11:14.280]  I think it's a finite resource, actually.
[11:14.380 --> 11:16.060]  Yes, there's a huge shortage.
[11:16.340 --> 11:17.700]  Wait, there's a helium shortage?
[11:18.400 --> 11:21.780]  Well, we've just used quite a lot of it and it takes millions of years to get created.
[11:21.920 --> 11:26.620]  And it also is so light that it just leaks out of the top of the atmosphere.
[11:26.900 --> 11:30.960]  But then why can't I just get my balloons filled at like the grocery store with it?
[11:30.980 --> 11:32.400]  Why? What do you mean?
[11:32.820 --> 11:33.640]  It's a rare resource.
[11:33.640 --> 11:35.920]  Well, I mean, it's not like that we're going to run out.
[11:36.020 --> 11:41.860]  It's just as as demand, as it runs low or just get more expensive until eventually no one can afford it.
[11:41.960 --> 11:43.120]  So we can't make helium?
[11:43.800 --> 11:44.000]  No.
[11:44.800 --> 11:46.400]  How? Where does helium come from?
[11:47.380 --> 11:48.580]  Where does anything come from?
[11:49.140 --> 11:51.160]  Well, like the iPhone comes from Apple.
[11:52.300 --> 11:59.920]  This is the craziest. As soon as you ask the question, I'm like, we're about to hear the craziest shit we've ever heard on this podcast.
[12:00.820 --> 12:05.100]  Man, words out of your mouth and I was waiting with bated breath.
[12:05.540 --> 12:08.400]  The iPhone comes from Apple.
[12:08.420 --> 12:09.900]  I can source that product.
[12:10.320 --> 12:12.760]  I think helium just comes from the ground.
[12:13.240 --> 12:16.120]  Apple shut down their helium plant when Steve Jobs died.
[12:16.400 --> 12:16.740]  Oh no.
[12:17.360 --> 12:17.560]  Yeah.
[12:18.060 --> 12:20.320]  Well, is there a company that specializes in helium?
[12:20.760 --> 12:21.840]  There'd have to be, right?
[12:22.140 --> 12:24.660]  Companies that suck it out of the pockets in the ground.
[12:24.960 --> 12:25.980]  Helium extractors.
[12:26.060 --> 12:26.260]  Yeah.
[12:26.820 --> 12:28.680]  I can't tell if you guys are fucking with me or not.
[12:28.680 --> 12:30.260]  Nobody's fucking with you.
[12:30.640 --> 12:35.620]  Oh, Eric just wrote a non-renewable natural resource that comes from radioactive decay of uranium and thorium.
[12:36.300 --> 12:41.120]  So it's created by other stuff that takes a really long time to decay.
[12:41.220 --> 12:48.400]  But if you're sitting on an old ass uranium and thorium stockpile, you might be sitting pretty.
[12:48.720 --> 12:52.120]  Wait, so you drill in for it? You extract it?
[12:52.500 --> 12:52.680]  Yeah.
[12:53.360 --> 12:55.480]  Drill, baby, drill for helium.
[12:56.520 --> 12:59.540]  What do you think fracking is? It's just people trying to get helium for balloons.
[12:59.980 --> 13:02.620]  Yeah, fracking is all party city, I think.
[13:02.960 --> 13:05.220]  That's why they went out of business, because they stopped fracking.
[13:05.600 --> 13:07.860]  That's what happened. Oh, Biden.
[13:09.620 --> 13:16.860]  So I'm imagining like Minecraft, theoretically, you could like hit a wall and then your voice would just get high pitched and you hit a pocket of helium.
[13:17.120 --> 13:21.860]  I don't think it's man drill. I think they're tiny little minuscule holes.
[13:21.860 --> 13:26.320]  No, I got to go with Andrew on this one. You dig a hole too deep and then you sound funny.
[13:26.320 --> 13:29.260]  I think I found it! Yeah, I'm pretty sure I found it, guys!
[13:30.120 --> 13:31.380]  I think I found the vein!
[13:32.180 --> 13:34.500]  I do like the idea of like, oh, I wonder what's through here.
[13:34.640 --> 13:35.240]  Oh, shit.
[13:36.600 --> 13:38.660]  It's like a canary for a completely different use.
[13:40.220 --> 13:42.020]  High pitched canary, we found some voice.
[13:42.600 --> 13:44.180]  Oh my God, listen, that canary.
[13:44.920 --> 13:46.440]  We struck gold!
[13:47.840 --> 13:51.000]  Okay, so they mine it and it's not something we made.
[13:51.000 --> 13:55.180]  Well, and I think hydrogen would be even lighter than helium.
[13:56.600 --> 13:57.040]  Wait...
[13:59.300 --> 14:02.720]  Because it's... well, it's also very flammable though, they don't use it.
[14:02.800 --> 14:04.100]  That's the bomb, right?
[14:06.520 --> 14:07.780]  That's how... well, wait.
[14:08.300 --> 14:12.680]  Why are we teaching this to Andrew? Why are we bothering to teach this to Andrew?
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.540]  Isn't that what you need for water too, right? You need hydrogen?
[14:18.520 --> 14:19.640]  I mean, it's in water, yeah.
[14:19.640 --> 14:20.880]  Yeah, it's part of water.
[14:21.020 --> 14:22.060]  Yeah, it's an element.
[14:22.400 --> 14:25.000]  Okay, so can hydrogen float?
[14:25.420 --> 14:27.240]  It's the H part of water.
[14:27.740 --> 14:28.800]  Hydrogen float.
[14:29.160 --> 14:32.180]  Because helium floats. That's why I want helium better.
[14:32.980 --> 14:34.340]  Does rocks float on helium?
[14:36.940 --> 14:39.180]  This is a great... this is our baby.
[14:39.480 --> 14:42.380]  Welcome to 2013 Rooster Teeth. Hell yeah, we're doing it.
[14:44.380 --> 14:48.420]  Now that we've somehow managed to make it fucking...
[14:48.420 --> 14:53.140]  15 minutes into this podcast, we should probably mention the goddamn Gerblers.
[14:53.420 --> 14:53.920]  Thank you.
[14:54.160 --> 14:56.680]  How much helium would you need to lift the Gerbler?
[14:58.740 --> 15:01.400]  Probably not much. A couple of balloons I think would do it.
[15:01.760 --> 15:01.900]  Yeah.
[15:02.680 --> 15:05.820]  Not to go back to helium, but that's like... why aren't we using it more?
[15:06.460 --> 15:08.020]  Because it's a finite resource.
[15:08.460 --> 15:15.480]  Okay, so wait, you started with this, and then we said it's running out, and now you're back to we should do more?
[15:15.480 --> 15:19.820]  We should. We need to figure out helium. There needs to be an investment in helium.
[15:20.260 --> 15:21.400]  What do we use it for, Andrew?
[15:21.900 --> 15:28.240]  What I want to use it for is I have stairs in my place, and lifting up groceries can be very heavy.
[15:28.860 --> 15:31.880]  And I was thinking of what would be an easy way to do it.
[15:32.220 --> 15:35.920]  And helium doesn't... you need like a million balloons to lift up two pounds.
[15:37.240 --> 15:38.200]  It's not efficient.
[15:39.140 --> 15:44.080]  So I was wondering, and you guys are more science-minded than I am, why don't we synthesize it?
[15:44.080 --> 15:45.940]  Why aren't we making more effective helium?
[15:46.420 --> 15:47.400]  You know what they say...
[15:47.400 --> 15:47.820]  But now I know.
[15:48.400 --> 15:49.860]  Necessity is the mother of invention.
[15:50.080 --> 15:56.920]  So maybe what we should do is just blow through the entire global supply of helium as quickly as possible,
[15:57.060 --> 16:00.040]  because then we'll invent a replacement even that much faster.
[16:00.440 --> 16:04.200]  I'm going to go to the grocery store and get six balloons right after this. I'm doing my part.
[16:04.660 --> 16:10.000]  Don't some like Arctic hikers and some people that hike in remote areas,
[16:10.000 --> 16:14.820]  don't they sometimes bring a helium balloon that they'll attach to their pack to make them a little lighter?
[16:16.120 --> 16:18.120]  I don't... I think that that's true.
[16:18.380 --> 16:18.820]  Really?
[16:19.580 --> 16:21.480]  I think you're just describing balloon fight.
[16:22.460 --> 16:24.940]  Maybe this is how...
[16:25.680 --> 16:26.480]  Oh, maybe.
[16:27.500 --> 16:27.940]  Spoilers.
[16:29.020 --> 16:29.540]  Is that how it is?
[16:31.140 --> 16:31.580]  Spoilers!
[16:31.740 --> 16:32.380]  Bleep it.
[16:33.500 --> 16:35.160]  Nick posted a photo of the up guy.
[16:36.020 --> 16:37.880]  Imagine if he could do that with like six balloons.
[16:38.500 --> 16:39.060]  That would be great.
[16:40.540 --> 16:42.040]  I guess that's probably dangerous.
[16:42.160 --> 16:45.780]  There's actually... there's probably a line in which you can make helium too effective.
[16:46.340 --> 16:49.160]  Well, yeah, it all comes from like radioactive decay, doesn't it?
[16:49.220 --> 16:50.200]  So like...
[16:50.200 --> 16:50.980]  What the fuck?
[16:51.520 --> 16:55.980]  The thing that I would use to give me high pitch voice comes from radioactive decay?
[16:56.360 --> 16:57.440]  Yeah, is that not what it is?
[16:57.520 --> 17:00.140]  I'm pretty... like we said that earlier. I'm pretty sure that's what it is.
[17:00.460 --> 17:01.780]  Yeah, we read that.
[17:02.300 --> 17:05.420]  Oh, yeah, radioactive decay of the uranium in a...
[17:05.420 --> 17:07.160]  Oh, Jeff posting a photo of a backpack.
[17:07.160 --> 17:08.920]  See, this is what I mean.
[17:10.240 --> 17:12.220]  How convenient that would be.
[17:12.420 --> 17:16.340]  So you're not really wearing the backpack then, you're kind of just taking it for a walk with you.
[17:17.000 --> 17:19.180]  That's... yes, that's what I want my groceries to do.
[17:19.300 --> 17:20.740]  Now, hang on, hang on.
[17:20.860 --> 17:24.120]  What Jeff described is people actually doing hikes and this helps them.
[17:24.400 --> 17:28.640]  This appears to be part of like a YouTube video where they're going to do like a gender reveal.
[17:29.060 --> 17:31.800]  What is... there's like stuff in the balloons.
[17:33.660 --> 17:36.240]  These are... this is like the cra... it's like an empty backpack.
[17:36.500 --> 17:37.400]  What is this?
[17:37.480 --> 17:41.280]  I just thought it was a better image than this one, which is the only other one I could find.
[17:41.520 --> 17:42.580]  Backpacking with balloon assist.
[17:42.820 --> 17:43.840]  Nah, I like that.
[17:44.440 --> 17:46.800]  It's tiny. Tiny little...
[17:48.340 --> 17:51.220]  Is there like a balloon lifestyle thing?
[17:51.380 --> 17:53.440]  Like, can I... can I make ballooning my lifestyle?
[17:53.900 --> 17:55.220]  Well, some people get off over it.
[17:55.580 --> 17:57.880]  I'm pretty sure I just saw TikTok on this and that's why it's in my head.
[17:57.900 --> 17:59.120]  Oh, yeah, people do get off over it, yeah.
[17:59.120 --> 18:05.860]  What do you... no, when you say they get off over it, what... like they're attracted to the balloon or they're doing something with the balloon or they're...
[18:05.860 --> 18:08.580]  I think they like get in them and they get hot in them and...
[18:08.580 --> 18:10.020]  They get hard in the balloon?
[18:10.400 --> 18:17.060]  A lot of people find... are sexually fulfilled by popping balloons and rubbing on balloons and stuff.
[18:17.200 --> 18:18.020]  There's that fetish too.
[18:18.260 --> 18:18.680]  I don't want that.
[18:19.100 --> 18:19.440]  I don't like it.
[18:19.440 --> 18:19.880]  Yeah, there you go.
[18:20.480 --> 18:21.340]  There's one right there.
[18:22.140 --> 18:25.320]  That's one of the biggest balloon perverts on Earth.
[18:25.320 --> 18:27.140]  Can that be the thumbnail?
[18:27.380 --> 18:30.200]  It's the worst picture of a person I've ever seen.
[18:30.200 --> 18:33.800]  It's a picture of slow-mo Dan in a giant balloon.
[18:33.920 --> 18:35.280]  What you can't see because of the balloon.
[18:35.380 --> 18:36.520]  He's cumming in that photo.
[18:37.040 --> 18:39.180]  Well, that's how it's getting so filled at the bottom.
[18:39.600 --> 18:45.100]  Do you think that that is... you know how there's like the iconic Farrah Fawcett poster?
[18:45.540 --> 18:49.680]  Like there's a certain... is that the number one balloon kink photo?
[18:50.600 --> 18:52.320]  That's actually the next shirt I'm selling.
[18:55.320 --> 18:58.100]  It's just going to be that cut out perfectly on a little black shirt.
[18:58.540 --> 19:00.380]  Oh, dude, that's so funny.
[19:00.660 --> 19:01.340]  Oh, my God.
[19:01.520 --> 19:01.700]  Oh, man.
[19:04.100 --> 19:06.700]  Make your next vacation unforgettable.
[19:07.360 --> 19:10.860]  On Royal Caribbean's newest ship, Star of the Seas.
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.780]  It's everything you've loved about every family vacation you've ever been on.
[19:14.960 --> 19:18.180]  With mind-blowing thrills at the largest water park at sea.
[19:18.520 --> 19:21.120]  Seven onboard pools for every level of chill.
[19:21.120 --> 19:23.520]  More than 40 ways to dine and drink.
[19:23.820 --> 19:28.280]  And even more to enjoy at our award-winning private island, Perfect Day at Coco Cay.

[19:34.520 --> 19:37.820]  Your ear bud fell in a coffee cup.
[19:38.220 --> 19:40.940]  You need a taco? Pick me up.
[19:41.860 --> 19:45.240]  When modern life gets rough, grab the timeless taste you love.
[19:45.540 --> 19:47.720]  Paso the Old El Paso.
[19:51.120 --> 19:52.800]  Uh, yeah, can you talk about the Gerplers now?
[19:53.160 --> 19:55.200]  Oh, yeah, Gerpler. We're doing a Gerpler thing.
[19:59.340 --> 20:01.640]  Why did you pick up the reins if that's all you were going to do with them?
[20:01.800 --> 20:03.260]  Right? I mean, right?
[20:03.580 --> 20:04.620]  To spike the reins.
[20:04.760 --> 20:05.460]  No, no, no, no, no.
[20:05.600 --> 20:06.620]  Wait, did you say Eric?
[20:06.620 --> 20:08.100]  I was not taking the reins.
[20:08.380 --> 20:09.100]  Wait, wait, wait.
[20:09.360 --> 20:10.840]  Wait, did Gavin say Eric?
[20:11.000 --> 20:11.100]  No, no, he said me.
[20:11.100 --> 20:13.180]  Oh, thank God. I thought you were coming after me.
[20:13.240 --> 20:14.780]  No, no, he wasn't. He definitely wasn't.
[20:15.200 --> 20:15.760]  Oh, my God.
[20:16.480 --> 20:19.600]  Sorry, I'm in a defensive posture against Gavin at all times.
[20:19.800 --> 20:22.860]  I think that Jeff naturally is always the guy in the reins.
[20:22.860 --> 20:26.560]  So that was like, I'm sitting between Eric and Jeff,
[20:26.680 --> 20:28.840]  and I was passing the reins to Jeff.
[20:29.160 --> 20:31.660]  Why would you pass it to me? I brought up the...
[20:31.660 --> 20:35.220]  I tried to cut off the helium conversation by bringing up the Gerpler,
[20:35.400 --> 20:38.700]  and you immediately took it away from me to go back to helium.
[20:39.260 --> 20:42.620]  So then when Andrew, when Eric brought up the fucking Gerpler,
[20:42.800 --> 20:43.820]  you picked up the reins.
[20:43.900 --> 20:45.540]  You said, oh, yeah, and then you launched into...
[20:45.540 --> 20:46.660]  No, but one sentence.
[20:47.120 --> 20:49.380]  My point, and I think if we pulled the audience, they'd agree.
[20:49.660 --> 20:51.460]  You're the reins guy of this show.
[20:51.460 --> 20:52.400]  Yeah, but you took the reins.
[20:52.400 --> 20:53.320]  I am not the reins guy.
[20:53.540 --> 20:55.480]  So I was giving it back to you.
[20:56.060 --> 20:57.000]  Why did you say...
[20:57.000 --> 20:58.840]  Because I was excited about it.
[20:59.060 --> 21:02.020]  We don't know where we're all sat in relation to each other in your head.
[21:02.420 --> 21:05.600]  Oh, that's a great point.
[21:06.060 --> 21:08.900]  I wouldn't know if I'm next to you to take the reins.
[21:08.900 --> 21:10.200]  Yeah, where are we?
[21:10.320 --> 21:11.160]  Where are we all sat?
[21:11.340 --> 21:11.600]  Okay.
[21:12.180 --> 21:13.740]  So Jeff is on like the end.
[21:14.000 --> 21:14.980]  Like he's to my...
[21:14.980 --> 21:16.380]  He's at the front of...
[21:16.380 --> 21:17.940]  He's the head of the table.
[21:18.560 --> 21:22.300]  First off, what shape is the table you're sitting at?
[21:23.520 --> 21:25.320]  It's like a square table.
[21:25.580 --> 21:27.200]  A square table, okay.
[21:27.520 --> 21:28.900]  For five people.
[21:29.680 --> 21:29.800]  Yeah.
[21:30.500 --> 21:32.720]  That's going to be difficult, but okay.
[21:32.900 --> 21:33.080]  Yeah.
[21:34.820 --> 21:37.940]  I don't know why we bought this table, but this is the table we're at.
[21:38.620 --> 21:42.660]  So is anybody on your plane with you on your side of the table?
[21:43.700 --> 21:44.180]  Yeah.
[21:44.880 --> 21:46.220]  Who's sitting next to you?
[21:46.340 --> 21:46.820]  Eric.
[21:47.480 --> 21:48.220]  Left or right?
[21:49.100 --> 21:49.220]  Left.
[21:49.900 --> 21:51.680]  So Eric is immediately left to you.
[21:51.980 --> 21:52.200]  Yeah.
[21:52.440 --> 21:53.480]  We got to draw this.
[21:53.600 --> 21:54.180]  Can I draw this?
[21:54.340 --> 21:55.000]  Yeah, please do.
[21:55.300 --> 21:57.940]  And then on the left side of the table, who's there?
[21:58.420 --> 21:59.420]  So this is how it goes.
[22:00.080 --> 22:02.200]  It's you on one end, right, by yourself.
[22:02.780 --> 22:03.360]  On the right side?
[22:04.580 --> 22:06.100]  Uh, at the bottom.
[22:07.120 --> 22:08.260]  What the fuck is that?
[22:08.260 --> 22:08.900]  Then I'm to your left.
[22:09.560 --> 22:11.460]  What is the bottom of a table?
[22:11.660 --> 22:12.660]  Am I under the legs?
[22:13.120 --> 22:13.480]  No.
[22:14.300 --> 22:14.680]  Okay.
[22:16.060 --> 22:17.240]  I'm shifting the table.
[22:17.440 --> 22:17.620]  One sec.
[22:18.320 --> 22:19.860]  So I'm at the bottom of the table.
[22:20.140 --> 22:22.240]  You're at the right side of it.
[22:22.440 --> 22:23.180]  You're at the right side.
[22:23.280 --> 22:25.000]  So you're by yourself on the right side of it.
[22:25.600 --> 22:27.600]  So Jeff's on the right and he's alone.
[22:28.060 --> 22:29.240]  He's alone on the right.
[22:29.640 --> 22:30.780]  I'm to his left.
[22:32.320 --> 22:33.200]  Wait, oh God.
[22:33.920 --> 22:36.500]  He's alone, but you're on the other corner.
[22:36.740 --> 22:37.860]  Yeah, I'm on the other corner.
[22:38.080 --> 22:38.260]  Yeah.
[22:38.960 --> 22:40.540]  There's an edge between us.
[22:41.080 --> 22:42.020]  I'm to his left.
[22:42.320 --> 22:42.580]  Got it.
[22:43.220 --> 22:44.580]  Eric is to my left.
[22:45.200 --> 22:46.900]  Eric is to your left.
[22:47.000 --> 22:48.140]  But on the same side of the table.
[22:48.140 --> 22:49.360]  But on the same side of the table.
[22:49.580 --> 22:49.760]  Yes.
[22:49.860 --> 22:50.840]  Oh shit, okay.
[22:51.160 --> 22:52.600]  So you're in the same panel.
[22:52.720 --> 22:52.900]  Yeah.
[22:53.020 --> 22:53.080]  Yeah.
[22:53.280 --> 22:53.700]  Keep going.
[22:54.260 --> 22:57.760]  Okay, then Nick is on the other end, looking directly at Jeff.
[22:59.220 --> 22:59.620]  Yeah.
[23:00.040 --> 23:01.000]  That makes me uncomfortable.
[23:01.680 --> 23:06.240]  Gavin, you're on the opposite side of the table by yourself, next to Jeff on the other corner.
[23:06.600 --> 23:08.960]  Okay, so now I just need to write some labels in these.
[23:08.960 --> 23:11.580]  We've got Jeff.
[23:13.020 --> 23:14.220]  See if this is accurate.
[23:14.540 --> 23:15.400]  I think that was pretty clear.
[23:16.120 --> 23:16.640]  Andrew.
[23:16.940 --> 23:17.440]  We got there.
[23:18.320 --> 23:20.440]  Uh, wait, Eric was next to Andrew.
[23:21.140 --> 23:21.660]  Yep.
[23:23.000 --> 23:26.100]  Nick, for some reason, is looking straight at Jeff.
[23:26.320 --> 23:26.540]  Yep.
[23:27.680 --> 23:30.620]  I'm curious if other people think about this.
[23:31.240 --> 23:33.260]  People listening, is this what you imagine?
[23:34.760 --> 23:36.320]  What does your table look like?
[23:37.080 --> 23:37.880]  Save as.
[23:40.520 --> 23:43.840]  I don't know if you need to save it, I don't think there's necessarily any long-term use.
[23:44.040 --> 23:49.800]  I opened paint to try to do the same thing, and it crashed so fast.
[23:49.960 --> 23:54.760]  I drew a table, wrote Jeff, and then it went, we're done here, and it shut down on me.
[23:56.720 --> 23:57.700]  And that's enough of that.
[23:59.680 --> 24:01.060]  Where did that save to?
[24:01.560 --> 24:03.140]  Okay, it doesn't matter, we're done.
[24:03.520 --> 24:06.300]  Why isn't there a window?
[24:06.300 --> 24:07.300]  Why did I just put the thing?
[24:07.300 --> 24:10.500]  Hey, but you know what else is on the table? A Gerpler, Jeff, take it away.
[24:11.660 --> 24:17.220]  Well, that's right, Andrew, there is a Gerpler on the table, because we are very excited,
[24:17.620 --> 24:25.640]  dare I say proud, to announce that the next Gerpler drop will be this February the 14th.
[24:25.680 --> 24:31.920]  That is right, Valentine's Day is being rebranded globally to Gerpeltine's Day.
[24:32.340 --> 24:35.480]  February 14th is now officially Gerpeltine's Day.
[24:35.480 --> 24:41.160]  If you wanted to get one of the gorgeous black Gerplers, black as death, black as night,
[24:41.240 --> 24:45.440]  you can get one on Gerpeltine's Day, February 14th, 2025.
[24:46.040 --> 24:51.620]  We have purchased 5,000 goddamn Gerplers.
[24:51.920 --> 24:56.760]  Hopefully, that means you will be able to get the Gerpler of your dreams and desires,
[24:56.840 --> 24:59.940]  and what better way to do it than on Gerpeltine's Day?
[24:59.940 --> 25:05.340]  Give yourself the gift of Gerpeltine, give the gift of Gerpeltine to someone that you love,
[25:05.500 --> 25:09.400]  or cherish, or respect, or just medium okay with.
[25:09.460 --> 25:14.000]  Hell, even if you don't like them, maybe you can repair the relationship with a Gerpler,
[25:14.420 --> 25:20.900]  available to you, globally, on Gerpeltine's Day, February 14th, 2025.
[25:20.900 --> 25:29.760]  At 12pm noon central time, where we'll be streaming at twitch.tv slash the regulation pod.
[25:30.180 --> 25:34.940]  And I feel like if you can't get one this time, I genuinely don't know what to do.
[25:35.240 --> 25:36.020]  Order more!
[25:36.120 --> 25:40.160]  To be clear, we ordered these when we sold out immediately in the last one.
[25:40.240 --> 25:42.480]  This is how long it takes for them to come back in.
[25:42.780 --> 25:48.740]  This is the reorder to try to make sure people get the black Gerplers that they wanted.
[25:48.740 --> 25:52.980]  But, before we get to Gavin's drawing, let's wrap this part out.
[25:53.120 --> 26:00.880]  But, something that we were able to get faster, and something we wanted to get to the people,
[26:01.420 --> 26:05.500]  are no scrumping signs and protected by falcon signs.
[26:05.720 --> 26:10.420]  We've reprinted those, the original art and everything, the original sizing, no scrumping,
[26:10.800 --> 26:15.260]  protected by falcons, but Andrew had a really good idea regarding those signs.
[26:15.260 --> 26:20.420]  Well, it was a hotly debated topic when we were discussing it, because we wanted to restock these things.
[26:20.920 --> 26:24.100]  But we couldn't determine which was wanted more.
[26:24.740 --> 26:29.780]  We had different views on that, and then also how many to order for each,
[26:30.140 --> 26:32.000]  because we don't want people to be disappointed.
[26:32.800 --> 26:37.400]  We want to be able to provide merch for people that want it. That's always the goal.
[26:37.860 --> 26:42.220]  But we've never sold more than 300 of those things at a time, I don't think.
[26:42.220 --> 26:46.680]  Which makes it hard for us to determine the true demand for it.
[26:46.980 --> 26:55.340]  And also, there's a fun layer of this, we were talking about gauging this for a future merch release type thing.
[26:56.640 --> 27:01.320]  We're kind of debating between what would sell fastest when we do this stream,
[27:01.640 --> 27:03.220]  or what we'll even sell more of, I guess.
[27:03.560 --> 27:08.300]  I mean, it's very possible we don't sell out on either of these things, but what would be more popular?
[27:08.300 --> 27:11.540]  And so, I talked with our wonderful mod team.
[27:12.200 --> 27:16.240]  You guys, do you want to pop in? Click the Regulation Pod Discord.
[27:16.640 --> 27:21.300]  Which is free, by the way, we should put a link in the info of the meta for this.
[27:21.600 --> 27:23.740]  Yeah, please join the Regulation Discord.
[27:24.660 --> 27:25.760]  Yeah, totally free.
[27:26.100 --> 27:26.600]  It's a lot of fun.
[27:27.100 --> 27:28.880]  It's great, it's an amazing server.
[27:29.460 --> 27:31.680]  You guys click in, I'm going to guide you to something.
[27:32.360 --> 27:33.220]  We can put our votes down.
[27:33.220 --> 27:36.580]  Ah shit, I joined Jeremy's.
[27:37.980 --> 27:39.980]  Alright, I'm on the...
[27:41.680 --> 27:44.220]  I'm in Jack's Sunday group.
[27:44.680 --> 27:44.980]  Nope.
[27:45.520 --> 27:45.820]  What?
[27:46.080 --> 27:46.320]  That's not it.
[27:46.860 --> 27:48.920]  Where they play 7 Days to Die or whatever.
[27:49.200 --> 27:52.660]  Okay, no, I'm in the Regulation Pod.
[27:53.180 --> 27:57.460]  So once you're in, you'll see at the top there's a category called Podcast Announcements.
[27:57.800 --> 28:00.400]  And then a channel called The Sign Vote.
[28:00.720 --> 28:01.680]  The Sign Vote, okay.
[28:01.680 --> 28:06.220]  So this provides all the information of where it is on the store, when they go up and all that.
[28:06.560 --> 28:06.860]  Wow.
[28:06.920 --> 28:09.060]  What we're doing is we're picking sides.
[28:09.520 --> 28:10.620]  And we're going to see who's going to win.
[28:10.720 --> 28:12.820]  You can pick a team, you can only pick one team.
[28:14.080 --> 28:19.560]  And then once the stream goes live, this will be turned off and you're locked in to whatever you pick.
[28:19.960 --> 28:27.720]  Whatever side wins this, the people that pick that side will get a unique Discord role relating to that side.
[28:27.720 --> 28:28.940]  Oh, wow.
[28:29.060 --> 28:32.580]  So we pick that by using these reactions at the bottom?
[28:32.800 --> 28:35.020]  Yes, there is reactions at the bottom.
[28:35.480 --> 28:36.780]  You can pick one.
[28:38.840 --> 28:40.980]  Team Falcon or Team Skrump.
[28:41.560 --> 28:42.460]  I'm going Team Skrump.
[28:42.940 --> 28:43.380]  Oh, wow.
[28:44.140 --> 28:45.000]  You guys are crazy.
[28:45.540 --> 28:46.860]  You don't think Skrump...
[28:47.620 --> 28:48.600]  It's an OG.
[28:49.340 --> 28:51.880]  Skrump's the OG and it's such an iconic sign.
[28:52.060 --> 28:53.120]  But we're protected by Falcons.
[28:53.120 --> 28:55.440]  A guy like me is protected by Falcons.
[28:57.680 --> 28:58.620]  Gavin, did you vote?
[28:59.360 --> 29:00.800]  I can't find what you're talking about.
[29:00.840 --> 29:01.140]  Okay.
[29:03.220 --> 29:04.180]  What is it?
[29:05.260 --> 29:05.700]  Announcements?
[29:06.200 --> 29:07.640]  See at the top, Podcast Announcements.
[29:08.300 --> 29:09.520]  And then below it, the sign.
[29:09.660 --> 29:11.700]  Three things below that, it says the sign vote.
[29:12.400 --> 29:14.020]  Mine's actually above it in suggestions.
[29:14.400 --> 29:15.620]  Oh, it's above it.
[29:17.220 --> 29:17.480]  Weird.
[29:18.120 --> 29:18.540]  Oh, okay.
[29:18.860 --> 29:22.780]  Okay, and then it's the whole, hey, it's time, pick your team.
[29:22.780 --> 29:26.640]  You scroll down below the link and there's two places to vote.
[29:26.800 --> 29:28.460]  The Skrumping or the Falcon.
[29:29.160 --> 29:29.380]  Gavin.
[29:29.580 --> 29:30.640]  I haven't voted yet.
[29:30.740 --> 29:31.180]  No.
[29:32.240 --> 29:33.580]  You're also a Skrump man.
[29:34.060 --> 29:34.500]  Interesting.
[29:34.980 --> 29:36.240]  I'm going to pick Falcon.
[29:37.260 --> 29:37.640]  Interesting.
[29:38.140 --> 29:38.600]  Team Falcon.
[29:39.100 --> 29:42.100]  I was initially on the Skrump side, but I think I might go Falcon.
[29:42.320 --> 29:44.140]  Well, it's a tough thing because Skrump...
[29:44.140 --> 29:47.720]  The no Skrumping is definitely the more iconic, longer-lasting thing.
[29:47.860 --> 29:50.820]  But I feel like Falcons have been a lot more relevant recently.
[29:50.820 --> 29:54.900]  I think Falcons have been a lot louder about getting the Falcon signs reprinted, too.
[29:55.220 --> 30:01.760]  I also think Skrumping is who we were, it's in our Apple DNA, obviously, but Falcons are who we are.
[30:02.220 --> 30:03.480]  At least that's how I'm viewing it.
[30:03.620 --> 30:10.560]  Did you see, though, on the podcast where he posted a picture of us with the Falcon, that it's not a Falcon?
[30:11.720 --> 30:12.660]  That's what I heard.
[30:12.980 --> 30:14.100]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[30:14.500 --> 30:16.640]  Someone said it's a Harris Hawk.
[30:17.040 --> 30:17.800]  Yeah, that's a Falcon.
[30:18.240 --> 30:19.320]  Produced by Falcons and Hawks.
[30:19.320 --> 30:22.340]  Yeah, you're just shortening it to Falcon because it's too long to say it the other way.
[30:22.920 --> 30:24.460]  You didn't know that Hudson Hawk was a Falcon?
[30:25.260 --> 30:25.420]  Yeah.
[30:26.240 --> 30:27.080]  Everyone knows this.
[30:27.800 --> 30:29.240]  But what are you going to call the movie Hudson Falcon?
[30:29.520 --> 30:30.980]  It doesn't have a ring to it.
[30:31.000 --> 30:32.640]  Well, his name's not Captain Hawk, it's Captain Falcon.
[30:32.640 --> 30:37.000]  Danny Aiello's not signing on to be in Hudson Falcon, he's only signing on to be in Hudson Hawk.
[30:37.320 --> 30:39.560]  Would you rather be protected by Falcons or Hawks, Gavin?
[30:40.080 --> 30:41.040]  Oh, Falcons, I think.
[30:41.240 --> 30:41.480]  Easy.
[30:42.220 --> 30:43.700]  Falcon is a cool name.
[30:44.280 --> 30:45.020]  It is a cool name.
[30:45.320 --> 30:48.020]  And that's why we're protected by them, so we're protected by Falcons.
[30:48.020 --> 31:00.980]  Now, that will also go on sale at the same time as the Gerpler, which is February 14th at 12, that's noon, central time, at Regulation Store.
[31:01.060 --> 31:01.500]  Hang on.
[31:01.780 --> 31:02.400]  What is it?
[31:02.860 --> 31:05.100]  Is it Regulation.Store?
[31:05.400 --> 31:06.300]  Jeff.Sucks.
[31:08.840 --> 31:10.080]  RegulationStore.com.
[31:10.200 --> 31:10.520]  Thank you.
[31:10.780 --> 31:11.640]  Or RegulationStore.Store.
[31:11.700 --> 31:12.940]  I went to JeffSucks.
[31:13.220 --> 31:14.460]  Jeff.Sucks.
[31:15.020 --> 31:16.620]  And it took me to a HostGator site.
[31:17.900 --> 31:19.300]  Jeff.Sucks has expired?
[31:20.040 --> 31:21.180]  It might be.
[31:21.640 --> 31:21.960]  No!
[31:22.340 --> 31:22.900]  Give it a try.
[31:23.100 --> 31:24.640]  Oh, God, it doesn't work anymore.
[31:25.420 --> 31:26.160]  Jeff.Sucks.
[31:26.600 --> 31:26.660]  Gavin!
[31:27.520 --> 31:28.800]  Can't lean on this, man.
[31:28.940 --> 31:29.380]  You gotta...
[31:29.380 --> 31:29.700]  Gavin, get it!
[31:29.880 --> 31:32.160]  Oh, shit, did I not pay my bill?
[31:32.580 --> 31:33.440]  Damn it, Gavin.
[31:34.480 --> 31:35.880]  Well, I'll try and get back on that.
[31:36.380 --> 31:39.600]  We'll definitely go to RegulationStore.com then.
[31:40.240 --> 31:41.440]  Well, Gavin gets back on that.
[31:41.440 --> 31:45.760]  We often talk about how amazing our community is.
[31:46.080 --> 31:46.600]  I love them.
[31:47.080 --> 31:47.640]  They're so creative.
[31:48.260 --> 31:49.200]  Do you see what they did?
[31:49.500 --> 31:52.100]  Do you see what those people did?
[31:52.420 --> 31:53.760]  The mischief they've caused?
[31:54.440 --> 31:54.820]  No.
[31:55.680 --> 31:56.340]  Let me promise.
[31:58.300 --> 32:02.840]  It's one of my favorite things about our community is they just do things.
[32:03.040 --> 32:05.540]  They just do things that are really funny and great.
[32:05.540 --> 32:11.060]  And people now, you know, there's a movie that we have some history with.
[32:11.420 --> 32:18.400]  If people go on the IMDb Trivia for it, there's a new fun fact on the IMDb Trivia page.
[32:18.700 --> 32:33.340]  If you go to the Tuxedos Trivia page on IMDb, one of the submitted pieces of trivia is the titular tuxedo worn by Jackie Chan was bought at auction by podcaster Andrew Patton in 2022.
[32:33.340 --> 32:37.620]  And it's currently in a pile in Jeff Ramsey's closet.
[32:37.740 --> 32:38.760]  12 upvotes.
[32:40.000 --> 32:41.120]  That's so stupid.
[32:41.540 --> 32:43.420]  It made me so happy that the premise that...
[32:44.080 --> 32:50.140]  Because whenever I finish a movie, I love to go to the trivia and just kind of like scan it, learn about the movie a little bit.
[32:50.440 --> 32:58.240]  The premise of people doing that and having no concept of what this podcast is and reading that makes me so happy.
[32:58.900 --> 33:01.980]  It's a shame it doesn't mention the podcast by name for a little bit of promo.
[33:01.980 --> 33:04.500]  Because we could have potentially had 12 new listeners there.
[33:04.820 --> 33:05.440]  Oh, shit.
[33:06.500 --> 33:14.980]  It's those wild little moments that just make the podcast... not worth it to me because clearly it's worth it, but just make it that much extra special to me.
[33:15.460 --> 33:22.320]  There are people out there that have no idea who we are, but they believe a Don Zimmer baseball card is worth more than a used to be.
[33:23.400 --> 33:24.660]  That was pretty great.
[33:25.080 --> 33:27.660]  That'll never not be the coolest thing ever to me.
[33:28.240 --> 33:36.660]  Hey, before we get too far past it, Andrew, Gavin made a drawing of your mind table.
[33:37.260 --> 33:37.800]  Yeah, what do you think?
[33:38.140 --> 33:40.340]  Your Andrew's mind table.
[33:42.800 --> 33:45.320]  Way off. He's completely wrong, but it's fine.
[33:45.480 --> 33:45.720]  What?
[33:45.860 --> 33:47.680]  That's exactly what you described.
[33:48.100 --> 33:50.960]  Except you spelled G-E-I-F-F, by the way.
[33:51.240 --> 33:51.960]  Ah, shit.
[33:53.340 --> 33:56.000]  It was so small, I could barely read it.
[33:56.420 --> 33:58.460]  What do you mean? That's exactly what you said.
[33:58.720 --> 33:59.860]  That is what you said.
[33:59.960 --> 34:00.840]  No, no.
[34:01.220 --> 34:04.360]  Do you picture a rectangular table and Jeff's on the left?
[34:04.720 --> 34:05.100]  No.
[34:05.960 --> 34:06.760]  What are you talking about?
[34:06.760 --> 34:07.420]  You said square.
[34:08.540 --> 34:12.660]  How did I know that what I perfectly listened to and replicated would be wrong?
[34:13.220 --> 34:16.200]  Okay, so let me, for the people that can see this image.
[34:18.160 --> 34:19.240]  It's in the YouTube version.
[34:19.280 --> 34:21.380]  Go to the YouTube and watch it. Yeah, it's in the YouTube version.
[34:21.420 --> 34:21.880]  Or the Patreon.
[34:22.320 --> 34:23.340]  Or the Patreon.
[34:24.040 --> 34:25.140]  Jeff and Nick are flipped.
[34:25.660 --> 34:28.000]  The fuck we are? I was to your right. You said that.
[34:28.040 --> 34:29.200]  Yeah, you said that.
[34:29.320 --> 34:31.840]  Okay, well, I'm trying to correct it in the least...
[34:31.840 --> 34:33.960]  Okay, so then slide me down.
[34:34.540 --> 34:36.300]  You're right, based on what I said.
[34:36.460 --> 34:37.940]  Gavin, I can't believe you fucked that up.
[34:38.180 --> 34:40.040]  No, no, no, based on what I said, you're right, you're right, you're right.
[34:40.100 --> 34:41.980]  Based on what I said, you slide me down.
[34:42.100 --> 34:43.360]  I'm next to Jeff on the corner.
[34:43.920 --> 34:45.960]  Where Eric is...
[34:45.960 --> 34:46.560]  No, calm down.
[34:47.020 --> 34:48.340]  One second, let's be adults about this.
[34:48.340 --> 34:51.340]  Where Eric is in relation to Nick
[34:51.340 --> 34:53.480]  is where I am on the other side with Jeff.
[34:53.900 --> 34:56.420]  Oh, you just need to scoot the chair to the right a little bit?
[34:56.740 --> 34:57.320]  Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:57.320 --> 34:58.220]  So I need to scoot down.
[34:58.900 --> 35:00.640]  That's beyond pedantic, dude.
[35:00.960 --> 35:02.360]  Then Gavin, you gotta scoot down.
[35:03.140 --> 35:03.940]  Scoot down where?
[35:04.620 --> 35:05.940]  So you're level with me.
[35:06.360 --> 35:07.540]  So we're with Jeff.
[35:08.440 --> 35:10.640]  And then Eric has to scoot down a little bit.
[35:10.900 --> 35:12.980]  Okay, so everyone's on their correct side,
[35:13.460 --> 35:14.220]  but the spacing is off.
[35:14.220 --> 35:16.840]  Yeah, the siding is all correct, just the positioning is off.
[35:16.840 --> 35:18.580]  Oh, I was completely wrong!
[35:18.860 --> 35:20.380]  This is the craziest...
[35:20.380 --> 35:22.860]  Andrew, you're a crazy person.
[35:22.940 --> 35:24.700]  Andrew, what you've described is
[35:24.700 --> 35:26.940]  everybody gets as physically far
[35:26.940 --> 35:28.340]  away from Nick as possible.
[35:28.500 --> 35:30.980]  Yeah, Nick is on the other side by himself.
[35:31.980 --> 35:32.900]  Because we don't know
[35:32.900 --> 35:34.120]  if he's got the monkey mask or not.
[35:34.200 --> 35:35.200]  We need some distance.
[35:35.440 --> 35:38.800]  I'm fine with that. I can sit closer to Jeff.
[35:39.020 --> 35:39.520]  That's fine.
[35:39.820 --> 35:41.880]  Is there a table curtain maybe Nick's sitting behind?
[35:46.060 --> 35:47.020]  I think...
[35:47.020 --> 35:48.200]  I think I was pretty clear
[35:48.200 --> 35:49.820]  that I was directly next to Jeff
[35:49.820 --> 35:51.440]  and that is not at all close to Jeff.
[35:51.600 --> 35:52.820]  You are directly next to Jeff.
[35:52.880 --> 35:54.100]  There's no one between you!
[35:55.420 --> 35:55.900]  That's...
[35:55.900 --> 35:58.420]  If I'm standing in an end zone
[35:58.420 --> 36:00.280]  of a football field and I say
[36:00.280 --> 36:02.920]  there's no one between us and you're at the 50 yard line,
[36:03.200 --> 36:04.140]  you're not next to me.
[36:04.940 --> 36:06.700]  It's not to scale.
[36:07.040 --> 36:07.320]  This...
[36:08.960 --> 36:11.000]  If I said sit next to me
[36:11.000 --> 36:12.640]  at the table and you sat there,
[36:12.720 --> 36:13.760]  I'd be like, what's he doing?
[36:14.840 --> 36:15.720]  What do you mean?
[36:15.920 --> 36:17.500]  If I sat where?
[36:17.680 --> 36:19.880]  At your blue, if I sat where? At Jeff?
[36:20.300 --> 36:22.180]  If I'm sitting where Jeff is
[36:22.180 --> 36:24.680]  and I said, hey, come sit next to me at this table
[36:24.680 --> 36:26.680]  and then you sat where you're sitting
[36:26.680 --> 36:27.460]  in this image,
[36:28.460 --> 36:30.680]  I would think, what are you doing?
[36:31.020 --> 36:32.220]  I'm sat next to you!
[36:32.640 --> 36:33.740]  No you're not, you're so far away.
[36:35.840 --> 36:36.880]  If somebody else
[36:36.880 --> 36:39.060]  can sit to your left,
[36:39.060 --> 36:39.800]  you're too far.
[36:42.100 --> 36:42.900]  I want
[36:42.900 --> 36:45.160]  so badly to sit around a table with you
[36:45.160 --> 36:46.880]  all someday. Oh my god.
[36:47.320 --> 36:48.900]  I can explain it like this with cars,
[36:49.020 --> 36:51.020]  think about a parking space, I feel like that's pretty
[36:51.020 --> 36:53.060]  standardized sizing. If I
[36:53.060 --> 36:55.360]  say park next to me and you park
[36:56.420 --> 36:57.300]  three spots
[36:57.300 --> 36:59.120]  to my left, that's not next
[36:59.120 --> 37:01.220]  to me. That's three spots to my left.
[37:01.800 --> 37:03.020]  But if a car
[37:03.020 --> 37:04.440]  can park between you and I,
[37:05.260 --> 37:06.340]  you're not next to me.
[37:07.120 --> 37:08.360]  And I don't think that's crazy,
[37:08.400 --> 37:09.880]  I think people agree with me on this one.
[37:10.340 --> 37:11.800]  I don't think so. You don't think so?
[37:12.020 --> 37:14.420]  Well here's the thing, I'm excited to hear from all
[37:14.420 --> 37:16.260]  of them about it. If you
[37:16.260 --> 37:18.360]  say to somebody, sit next to me,
[37:19.700 --> 37:19.920]  you
[37:20.480 --> 37:22.420]  can't have space for somebody to
[37:22.420 --> 37:23.700]  become the next to.
[37:24.140 --> 37:25.600]  Alright, I'm redrawing this now.
[37:26.640 --> 37:26.920]  Okay.
[37:28.040 --> 37:30.300]  Put that there. I don't think when you ask
[37:30.300 --> 37:32.420]  someone to sit next to you, they can be far enough
[37:32.420 --> 37:34.500]  that someone can become the new next to.
[37:34.500 --> 37:36.320]  It's just a square table.
[37:36.460 --> 37:37.800]  No one sits on a corner.
[37:39.560 --> 37:40.000]  Gavin?
[37:41.780 --> 37:42.880]  Okay, I think I got it.
[37:43.140 --> 37:44.240]  Can you fix my fucking name?
[37:44.380 --> 37:45.620]  Yeah, do you know how to spell Jeff's name or no?
[37:46.080 --> 37:47.240]  Yeah, I'll fix that.
[37:48.080 --> 37:50.100]  Put that there.
[37:51.760 --> 37:52.200]  Save.
[37:52.520 --> 37:54.580]  I love that this guy is one of
[37:54.580 --> 37:56.480]  the greatest
[37:56.480 --> 37:58.420]  high-speed camera operators
[37:58.420 --> 38:00.440]  in the history of film, and we have them
[38:00.440 --> 38:02.400]  using MS Paint every podcast.
[38:05.840 --> 38:06.480]  It's fine.
[38:07.340 --> 38:08.340]  I'm gonna drag...
[38:10.080 --> 38:10.400]  Man,
[38:10.460 --> 38:12.420]  Windows 11, a real piece of shit.
[38:12.480 --> 38:13.640]  I don't know why, it just sucks.
[38:14.780 --> 38:15.980]  Okay, here we go. Is that the new one?
[38:16.660 --> 38:18.360]  Yeah, it sucks. Alright, how's that?
[38:19.160 --> 38:20.320]  That's perfect. That's
[38:20.320 --> 38:22.220]  really good. Oh, so wait, so
[38:22.220 --> 38:23.640]  I need to be that high?
[38:24.120 --> 38:25.780]  No, I mean, you should be closer, but it's fine.
[38:25.860 --> 38:28.020]  I thought you said I need to be far away from Nick.
[38:28.420 --> 38:30.420]  Yeah, you do, but that's fine. He put something else
[38:30.420 --> 38:31.720]  like he scratched out. It's fine.
[38:31.720 --> 38:33.440]  So the Gavin and the Andrew that were
[38:33.440 --> 38:35.340]  clearly violently murdered,
[38:35.680 --> 38:37.660]  were those doppelgangers or clones?
[38:38.260 --> 38:39.380]  That's up to Gavin, I don't know.
[38:39.460 --> 38:40.420]  They got $100,000.
[38:41.480 --> 38:43.580]  Yeah, the other one was me, but from the other bull.
[38:46.410 --> 38:47.270]  Who says
[38:47.270 --> 38:48.950]  you can't be the topic of conversation
[38:48.950 --> 38:50.490]  for all the right reasons?
[38:51.050 --> 38:53.310]  The Hyundai Tucson Hybrid pairs bold presence
[38:53.310 --> 38:55.010]  with advanced technology and sleek
[38:55.010 --> 38:57.190]  style. It's everything you didn't know you needed
[38:57.190 --> 38:58.850]  in an SUV and then some.
[38:59.130 --> 39:01.870]  Okay, Hyundai? Visit HyundaiUSA.com
[39:01.870 --> 39:02.750]  to learn more.
[39:06.280 --> 39:07.740]  Running a business means
[39:07.740 --> 39:09.200]  I wear lots of hats.

[39:25.600 --> 39:27.380]  easily share my job with my network.
[39:27.660 --> 39:29.520]  No other job site lets me do that.

[39:31.780 --> 39:34.140]  slash achieve. That's LinkedIn.com
[39:34.140 --> 39:36.000]  slash achieve. Terms and conditions
[39:36.000 --> 39:36.940]  apply. Oh!
[39:37.760 --> 39:39.900]  Dude, my wife remembered what the other
[39:39.900 --> 39:41.860]  hypothetical was when we were in
[39:41.860 --> 39:43.500]  Mexico. What was that hypothetical?
[39:43.720 --> 39:45.940]  Oh, yeah. It was
[39:46.640 --> 39:47.960]  six days a
[39:47.960 --> 39:49.520]  week you
[39:49.520 --> 39:52.060]  taste with your fingertips.
[39:52.660 --> 39:54.140]  Yeah, you taste buds are on your fingers.
[39:54.320 --> 39:54.560]  That's a classic, that one.
[39:55.100 --> 39:58.460]  How much money was it? Like $400,000
[39:58.460 --> 39:59.320]  or something?
[39:59.840 --> 40:00.840]  I don't know.
[40:01.040 --> 40:03.280]  It wasn't that much. It was like $100,000.
[40:03.800 --> 40:05.100]  Yeah. But it was
[40:05.100 --> 40:07.340]  really, it descended down to wiping your butt
[40:07.340 --> 40:09.380]  would be hard. Yeah. Why does
[40:09.380 --> 40:11.460]  your wife pay more attention to me than you do?
[40:11.980 --> 40:13.500]  Why would I pay attention to you?
[40:14.600 --> 40:15.260]  She has
[40:15.260 --> 40:17.280]  less exposure to you, so the moments here
[40:17.280 --> 40:18.820]  are more memorable.
[40:19.260 --> 40:21.420]  Yeah, she doesn't have to be in a defensive position
[40:21.420 --> 40:23.420]  with you. Yeah, you did try and fight
[40:23.420 --> 40:25.320]  me earlier a little bit. Yeah, I thought you said it was
[40:25.320 --> 40:27.360]  my fault. I was very ready to be like
[40:27.360 --> 40:29.400]  you're out of your mind. But thankfully
[40:29.400 --> 40:31.440]  in Andrew's mind table, you couldn't
[40:31.440 --> 40:32.980]  be further from me, so I feel safe.
[40:34.360 --> 40:35.260]  Also, he was
[40:35.260 --> 40:37.460]  really like, no, that's not where
[40:37.460 --> 40:39.400]  they need to sit. And then you redrew it, and he went, that's
[40:39.400 --> 40:40.040]  fine, whatever.
[40:41.440 --> 40:42.740]  Well, he's run out of space.
[40:43.380 --> 40:45.320]  I would do the, what is it, six days?
[40:45.460 --> 40:47.160]  You taste with your fingers? Yeah, it's fine.
[40:48.160 --> 40:49.320]  Ew. Really?
[40:49.820 --> 40:51.420]  Yeah. I'd get little
[40:52.420 --> 40:53.360]  things for my
[40:53.360 --> 40:55.480]  fingers. Every time you shook
[40:55.480 --> 40:57.440]  somebody's hand, it would be like you just made out with them.
[40:57.440 --> 40:58.280]  I'm not shaking hands.
[40:59.480 --> 41:01.540]  What would you put on your fingers?
[41:03.640 --> 41:03.960]  Uh...
[41:03.960 --> 41:05.420]  What would I put? What would be like
[41:05.420 --> 41:07.640]  the equivalent of a mouth that would just close them off?
[41:07.900 --> 41:08.920]  Is it the whole finger?
[41:09.220 --> 41:10.960]  Or is it the tips? It's like your
[41:11.800 --> 41:13.100]  fingerprint is your taste buds.
[41:13.240 --> 41:15.060]  You'd be sucking doorknobs, I assume.
[41:17.200 --> 41:17.520]  Um...
[41:17.520 --> 41:18.520]  I guess I'd wear gloves?
[41:20.980 --> 41:21.620]  So you'd
[41:21.620 --> 41:22.700]  just be tasting
[41:22.700 --> 41:24.920]  you'd just be tasting gloves all day?
[41:26.060 --> 41:26.780]  Yeah, I guess.
[41:26.900 --> 41:28.200]  I don't think it would be that bad.
[41:28.500 --> 41:30.980]  I would just squirt some frosting in the fingertips
[41:30.980 --> 41:31.600]  of each glove.
[41:31.880 --> 41:34.640]  Ooh, what if we try
[41:34.640 --> 41:36.820]  it out, see what it would feel like, by making a
[41:36.820 --> 41:38.820]  tongue glove, and we all have to try and wear
[41:38.820 --> 41:40.380]  a tongue glove for an entire meal?
[41:40.560 --> 41:42.880]  That sounds terrible. Alright, hold on, let me write this down.
[41:43.060 --> 41:43.940]  No, no, no, no, no.
[41:44.400 --> 41:45.060]  What do you mean, no?
[41:46.240 --> 41:48.040]  You're making me think away from this.
[41:48.740 --> 41:49.640]  You're persuading me away.
[41:50.460 --> 41:51.760]  Tongue glove sounds terrible.
[41:51.940 --> 41:53.680]  I'm into it, and I want to do it.
[41:53.680 --> 41:55.220]  But that's what you're saying that you would do.
[41:55.700 --> 41:57.540]  I know, that's why I'm saying he's
[41:57.540 --> 41:58.880]  persuading me out of this.
[41:59.060 --> 42:01.580]  I think I could fit my tongue down like a
[42:01.580 --> 42:03.420]  extra large thumb
[42:03.420 --> 42:05.900]  on a rubber glove.
[42:08.040 --> 42:09.540]  Alright, Geoff, write that down
[42:09.540 --> 42:10.340]  and let's see.
[42:11.120 --> 42:13.240]  I don't know what the fuck you just said.
[42:13.560 --> 42:15.220]  I'm trying to think of what would make a good tongue glove.
[42:15.780 --> 42:17.700]  He's gonna suck a glove or some shit.
[42:17.700 --> 42:19.240]  I got one right here, I was looking on
[42:19.240 --> 42:21.820]  Amazon, they exist. Tongue gloves
[42:21.820 --> 42:23.600]  exist? Oh my god. Tongue sleeve.
[42:24.220 --> 42:25.400]  A tongue sleeve?
[42:26.320 --> 42:27.540]  Disposable tongue covers?
[42:27.660 --> 42:28.440]  What are they for?
[42:29.400 --> 42:31.560]  Putting on your tongue? Prevents the tongue
[42:31.560 --> 42:33.440]  from tasting the bitterness of Chinese
[42:33.440 --> 42:35.640]  medicine. Oh, so it's like
[42:36.180 --> 42:37.720]  drink, like eat in a
[42:37.720 --> 42:39.080]  rhino horn or something.
[42:39.520 --> 42:41.720]  Yeah, I guess so. Well, anyway, we can
[42:41.720 --> 42:43.780]  buy some on Amazon right now. You guys want me to get them?
[42:44.140 --> 42:45.120]  That's wild. Yeah, get them.
[42:46.880 --> 42:47.760]  Hang on,
[42:47.840 --> 42:49.260]  maybe different ones, because this usually
[42:49.260 --> 42:51.060]  ships within one to two months.
[42:51.300 --> 42:52.940]  Holy Jesus.
[42:53.260 --> 42:54.400]  It's in the notes.
[42:54.720 --> 42:56.620]  Let me write the thing down.
[42:56.780 --> 42:58.260]  I got it on my notes. That's crazy.
[42:59.140 --> 42:59.320]  Okay.
[43:01.040 --> 43:03.380]  Okay, so just to be clear, you taste the thing
[43:03.860 --> 43:05.100]  but it doesn't
[43:05.100 --> 43:05.840]  impact you.
[43:07.280 --> 43:09.000]  What does that mean to you?
[43:09.140 --> 43:10.920]  The words you just said. Theoretically,
[43:11.420 --> 43:13.060]  I would be able to tell if food was
[43:13.060 --> 43:14.780]  poisoned without it
[43:14.780 --> 43:16.720]  impacting me by touch.
[43:17.060 --> 43:19.220]  What? Is that something you're commonly
[43:19.220 --> 43:21.160]  concerned with? Can you taste
[43:21.160 --> 43:23.080]  poison? Well, like food
[43:23.080 --> 43:24.960]  poisoning. Like if I
[43:25.560 --> 43:26.880]  put my finger on
[43:26.880 --> 43:28.720]  a piece of chicken...
[43:29.420 --> 43:31.040]  You think food poisoning has
[43:31.040 --> 43:33.140]  a taste, is what you're saying. Well, I guess it's
[43:33.140 --> 43:34.720]  texture, isn't it? It's not taste.
[43:35.220 --> 43:37.240]  No. It's more like undercooked.
[43:37.420 --> 43:39.020]  But yeah. Yeah, rawness
[43:39.020 --> 43:40.820]  of it. I guess I could just see that.
[43:40.820 --> 43:41.320]  Yeah.
[43:43.740 --> 43:44.940]  Why don't I do that?
[43:45.080 --> 43:46.880]  I should do that more. But you could just like
[43:46.880 --> 43:48.860]  chow down on like spinach
[43:48.860 --> 43:50.960]  and kale and then just stick your
[43:50.960 --> 43:52.880]  hand in a bowl of ice cream and it'd be
[43:52.880 --> 43:54.820]  like you were having the fucking best dessert of your life.
[43:55.280 --> 43:56.840]  That's interesting. And you could be
[43:56.840 --> 43:57.480]  like super healthy.
[44:00.300 --> 44:02.880]  It could be a real positive
[44:02.880 --> 44:04.580]  in the long run if you think about it.
[44:05.460 --> 44:06.620]  I guess I need to evaluate
[44:06.620 --> 44:08.500]  how much the chew means to me.
[44:09.880 --> 44:10.240]  You
[44:10.240 --> 44:12.600]  can still chew. You're still chewing.
[44:12.940 --> 44:14.260]  You still have to eat through your mouth.
[44:14.760 --> 44:16.560]  No, yeah, but I'm saying
[44:16.560 --> 44:18.560]  if I... I like to
[44:18.560 --> 44:20.780]  snack on a bag of popcorn. If I
[44:20.780 --> 44:22.480]  put my hand in the bag of popcorn
[44:23.040 --> 44:24.580]  am I just getting the experience
[44:24.580 --> 44:26.700]  of if I would normally be eating the popcorn?
[44:27.020 --> 44:28.320]  No, that would be like licking popcorn.
[44:28.440 --> 44:30.380]  You could put some in your mouth and chew it and if you just like
[44:30.380 --> 44:32.540]  rummage the bag with your hand, you'd probably have the
[44:32.540 --> 44:34.520]  same vibe. I don't like
[44:34.520 --> 44:35.220]  licking, ew.
[44:35.220 --> 44:37.240]  I don't like
[44:37.240 --> 44:39.080]  this now. It's like cucking
[44:39.080 --> 44:40.980]  yourself with food. I don't want it.
[44:43.600 --> 44:45.140]  Food cuck? I don't want
[44:45.140 --> 44:46.260]  a food cuck.
[44:47.240 --> 44:48.860]  Nickname tomorrow, let me write that down.
[44:49.060 --> 44:49.720]  Food cuck.
[44:50.860 --> 44:52.940]  Wouldn't that just be watching someone eat food?
[44:53.360 --> 44:54.520]  Watching somebody eat your food.
[44:57.340 --> 44:59.340]  Somebody goes into your fridge
[44:59.340 --> 45:00.860]  and eats your food.
[45:01.600 --> 45:02.640]  Well, you watch.
[45:02.640 --> 45:04.580]  You can't do anything about it.
[45:05.340 --> 45:06.520]  You just have to go
[45:06.520 --> 45:08.440]  yeah, that's right. Eat that banana.
[45:09.200 --> 45:10.620]  Give it to it. Yeah.
[45:11.160 --> 45:11.980]  Chew hard.
[45:13.860 --> 45:14.780]  They're gonna empty
[45:14.780 --> 45:16.200]  the whole fridge later.
[45:17.540 --> 45:18.240]  Pop a grape.
[45:21.580 --> 45:22.520]  Speaking of food,
[45:23.540 --> 45:24.760]  I wanted to run
[45:24.760 --> 45:26.580]  something by you guys if you don't mind.
[45:26.860 --> 45:27.780]  I would love to hear something.
[45:28.200 --> 45:30.800]  I would say we're a pretty fruit
[45:30.800 --> 45:32.020]  adjacent podcast.
[45:32.220 --> 45:34.700]  We definitely had our apple phases, but we dip in and out
[45:34.700 --> 45:36.760]  of all kinds of fruit. Hell, we just had a whole fruit
[45:36.760 --> 45:38.620]  taste test last week, right? So I'm always
[45:38.620 --> 45:40.800]  just kind of thinking about fruit in general.
[45:41.240 --> 45:42.920]  And just like elevating
[45:43.440 --> 45:44.940]  fruit because it's good for you.
[45:44.980 --> 45:46.260]  It's like healthy candy.
[45:46.700 --> 45:48.760]  And I want the world to enjoy fruit
[45:48.760 --> 45:50.820]  in the way that I do
[45:50.820 --> 45:52.240]  and that we do, right?
[45:52.320 --> 45:54.340]  I feel like that's
[45:54.340 --> 45:56.220]  a fairly reasonable thing to do.
[45:56.620 --> 45:57.840]  And that's when it hit me.
[45:57.840 --> 45:59.980]  What was the last big
[45:59.980 --> 46:02.020]  like, hey, eat fruit campaign
[46:02.020 --> 46:03.880]  that you remember? Because for me, it's
[46:03.880 --> 46:06.020]  probably an apple a day
[46:07.100 --> 46:07.800]  keeps the
[46:07.800 --> 46:08.960]  doctor away, right?
[46:09.380 --> 46:11.300]  Apple a day keeps the doctor away is what people say.
[46:11.420 --> 46:13.440]  I feel like it's outlived its usefulness.
[46:13.700 --> 46:15.120]  So I did a little bit of research.
[46:15.380 --> 46:17.640]  What is another thing that an apple a day
[46:17.640 --> 46:19.220]  could keep away, right?
[46:19.580 --> 46:21.800]  I wanted to pick something that doesn't
[46:21.800 --> 46:24.020]  already exist, that isn't already copywritten,
[46:24.240 --> 46:25.720]  that isn't already something
[46:25.720 --> 46:27.320]  that someone else can stake a claim and say,
[46:27.440 --> 46:29.720]  no, regulation guys, I already invented
[46:29.720 --> 46:31.120]  the spaghetti bread bowl.
[46:31.540 --> 46:32.620]  You can't have it, right?
[46:33.040 --> 46:34.540]  I wanted something free and clear.
[46:34.720 --> 46:37.220]  And I wanted something that's scarier than
[46:37.220 --> 46:39.140]  going to the doctor, which is pretty scary
[46:39.140 --> 46:41.020]  for some people, I must admit. I don't relish
[46:41.020 --> 46:43.520]  going to the doctor, but it's 2025, right?
[46:43.680 --> 46:45.740]  It's like, we're not scared by Alfred Hitchcock
[46:45.740 --> 46:47.540]  and movies and The Doctor anymore
[46:47.540 --> 46:49.820]  because we've had the last 50 years of horrors.
[46:50.180 --> 46:51.180]  We need to update
[46:51.580 --> 46:53.640]  the fear to something that matters
[46:53.640 --> 46:55.140]  to us in 2025.
[46:55.480 --> 46:56.660]  Something that we can leverage.
[46:57.340 --> 46:59.380]  That's why I'd like to introduce to you guys
[46:59.380 --> 47:01.540]  a nationwide, possibly a
[47:01.540 --> 47:02.960]  global-wide
[47:03.500 --> 47:05.400]  fruit initiative that
[47:05.400 --> 47:06.840]  we start right here today.
[47:07.180 --> 47:09.280]  An apple a day keeps the
[47:09.280 --> 47:11.380]  fruit demon away. Then we
[47:11.380 --> 47:12.760]  invent a fruit demon.
[47:13.200 --> 47:15.480]  It could be the scariest thing ever
[47:15.480 --> 47:17.540]  invented. We lean into the exorcist
[47:17.540 --> 47:19.260]  religious horror, but
[47:19.260 --> 47:21.600]  fruit-related. I've done intensive
[47:21.600 --> 47:23.580]  Google searching. No one has ever thought
[47:23.580 --> 47:25.740]  of fruit demon before. It's on us.
[47:25.840 --> 47:27.740]  We've got it. We're inventing fruit
[47:27.740 --> 47:29.400]  demon right now in this moment.
[47:29.440 --> 47:31.660]  You can make it as terrifying as
[47:31.660 --> 47:33.680]  humanly possible, and then we scare
[47:33.680 --> 47:35.640]  kids with it, and scare them that if they
[47:35.640 --> 47:37.520]  don't eat their apples, and if they don't eat their pineapple,
[47:37.780 --> 47:39.580]  and if they don't eat their peach
[47:39.580 --> 47:41.620]  chunks, the fruit demon's gonna come
[47:41.620 --> 47:43.500]  get them at night and rip all their
[47:43.500 --> 47:45.640]  flesh off, or eat their
[47:45.640 --> 47:47.640]  bones from the inside out
[47:47.640 --> 47:49.420]  while they're still alive, or
[47:49.420 --> 47:51.280]  strip their teeth while
[47:51.280 --> 47:53.340]  they're frozen and they can't move. I don't know.
[47:53.640 --> 47:55.200]  But something truly horrific
[47:55.200 --> 47:57.540]  that pushes people towards eating fruit
[47:57.540 --> 47:59.520]  out of fear. I like
[47:59.520 --> 48:01.620]  it. Do you notice the fruit
[48:01.620 --> 48:03.740]  demon away? No, but it can be horrifying.
[48:04.120 --> 48:05.620]  I'm figuring horns,
[48:06.020 --> 48:07.480]  muscles, fucking
[48:07.480 --> 48:09.600]  like super yoked,
[48:09.860 --> 48:11.800]  probably 6'5", 6'6",
[48:11.800 --> 48:13.140]  maybe a little bit of, maybe some
[48:13.140 --> 48:15.840]  patchy fur, trust fund,
[48:16.120 --> 48:17.600]  probably cloven hooves,
[48:17.600 --> 48:19.540]  I'm thinking maybe winged, maybe
[48:19.540 --> 48:21.500]  not, could have a pitchfork, could have something
[48:21.500 --> 48:23.600]  scarier than a pitchfork, like a, I don't
[48:23.600 --> 48:25.940]  know, what's scarier than a pitchfork in 2025?
[48:26.660 --> 48:27.840]  A stun gun?
[48:28.420 --> 48:29.760]  Right? It could zap
[48:29.760 --> 48:31.700]  ya? I don't know. But we can invent
[48:31.700 --> 48:33.660]  a fruit demon amongst the five
[48:33.660 --> 48:35.520]  of us. We have a team of artists
[48:35.520 --> 48:37.360]  and the regulation listeners and the
[48:37.360 --> 48:39.520]  comment leavers that can all lend their creativity
[48:39.520 --> 48:41.880]  to it, because this is a global, wide
[48:41.880 --> 48:43.440]  fruit eating initiative.
[48:43.840 --> 48:45.700]  We don't own it, we introduce
[48:45.700 --> 48:47.740]  it to the world, and then it becomes a part of
[48:47.740 --> 48:49.740]  the culture. What are the seven deadly
[48:49.740 --> 48:51.880]  sins of fruit eating? You know what?
[48:51.960 --> 48:53.720]  That's a great question, Andrew, and we need
[48:53.720 --> 48:55.160]  to figure out what they are.
[48:55.520 --> 48:57.720]  I'm not saying we need to do it in this moment, but we should
[48:58.600 --> 48:59.800]  definitely come up with them.
[49:00.100 --> 49:01.880]  Maybe next episode, why don't we all present
[49:01.880 --> 49:03.340]  our seven deadly fruit sins?
[49:04.080 --> 49:05.340]  Well, it won't be an example.
[49:06.280 --> 49:06.640]  Scurvy.
[49:10.330 --> 49:10.510]  laughter
[49:12.790 --> 49:13.150]  laughter
[49:13.870 --> 49:14.230]  laughter
[49:15.210 --> 49:15.690]  Thou
[49:16.230 --> 49:18.190]  shall not peel an orange and leave it
[49:18.190 --> 49:19.330]  uneaten. Yeah.
[49:19.690 --> 49:21.630]  Could you get scurvy if you wanted to?
[49:22.150 --> 49:23.710]  Yeah. How do you get it?
[49:23.710 --> 49:26.270]  I don't believe in scurvy. It's a pirate's disease.
[49:26.490 --> 49:28.730]  How can I get scurvy?
[49:29.190 --> 49:29.770]  It was like
[49:29.770 --> 49:32.090]  some sort of malnutrition on a boat, right?
[49:32.290 --> 49:34.110]  Yeah, you just don't give yourself any
[49:34.110 --> 49:35.750]  vitamin C for a long period of time.
[49:36.210 --> 49:37.570]  And you just get it?
[49:38.550 --> 49:40.590]  I always mistake gout with scurvy.
[49:41.550 --> 49:42.030]  Very
[49:42.030 --> 49:42.930]  different, I think.
[49:43.050 --> 49:43.510]  Very different.
[49:45.610 --> 49:47.110]  I'm always making that mistake in my head.
[49:47.510 --> 49:48.930]  You know, I'm looking through all my domains.
[49:49.150 --> 49:50.630]  I don't have jeff.sucks.
[49:50.810 --> 49:52.390]  Was it someone in the community did that?
[49:52.590 --> 49:53.350]  No, you didn't.
[49:53.750 --> 49:56.670]  I have regulationstore.com and regulationstore.store.
[49:56.790 --> 49:58.590]  I remember you buying it in the episode.
[49:58.890 --> 49:59.910]  You absolutely did it.
[50:00.350 --> 50:02.590]  Did it get revoked from me?
[50:03.010 --> 50:05.210]  I think it probably expired and then
[50:05.210 --> 50:06.550]  someone else claimed it, I would assume.
[50:06.930 --> 50:09.310]  How would I buy it for like six months?
[50:09.790 --> 50:11.330]  I don't know, why did you do that?
[50:14.270 --> 50:15.030]  Damn it.
[50:15.090 --> 50:16.950]  If you would have sat closer to me at the table,
[50:17.030 --> 50:17.670]  I would have told you.
[50:19.450 --> 50:20.610]  You're on the other...
[50:20.610 --> 50:21.210]  Nevermind.
[50:23.330 --> 50:25.030]  He doesn't know how positioning works.
[50:25.630 --> 50:26.570]  I gotta be honest with you guys.
[50:26.630 --> 50:29.010]  I'm a little worn out after my fruit demon spiel.
[50:29.390 --> 50:30.090]  Eric Fruit Demon?
[50:31.750 --> 50:33.050]  Did you just draw that?
[50:33.750 --> 50:34.910]  No, I didn't draw it.
[50:35.010 --> 50:37.570]  I started looking around for demon generators.
[50:37.570 --> 50:39.690]  Found one that I liked and then started going nuts.
[50:39.950 --> 50:40.930]  I will say this, dude.
[50:41.010 --> 50:43.410]  There's not much scarier than a demon in a g-string.
[50:43.590 --> 50:44.290]  That's terrifying.
[50:44.730 --> 50:47.230]  What I really like is he's got a bunch of horns
[50:47.230 --> 50:48.570]  that go forward style.
[50:49.250 --> 50:49.470]  Yeah.
[50:49.810 --> 50:52.570]  And he's got some crazy feet.
[50:53.290 --> 50:54.610]  Imagine that and it's like,
[50:54.710 --> 50:56.550]  if you want to see this guy, don't eat fruit.
[50:56.750 --> 50:58.530]  I don't want to see this guy.
[50:58.770 --> 51:00.730]  If you don't eat fruit,
[51:00.930 --> 51:03.490]  at least one portion of fruit a day,
[51:03.910 --> 51:05.570]  he could come in in your sleep
[51:05.570 --> 51:07.970]  and suck the marrow out of your bones
[51:07.970 --> 51:08.950]  while you watch.
[51:09.270 --> 51:11.430]  He'll turn you into
[51:11.430 --> 51:13.430]  an orange or something too. It'll be bad.
[51:13.810 --> 51:15.490]  You know what he eats for fun?
[51:16.170 --> 51:17.590]  Fingernails and toenails.
[51:17.750 --> 51:19.030]  Off of your body.
[51:19.750 --> 51:21.550]  He doesn't chew them down
[51:21.550 --> 51:22.650]  like a nervous habit.
[51:22.830 --> 51:25.290]  He chills them back and takes them off.
[51:25.290 --> 51:25.630]  I hate that.
[51:26.510 --> 51:29.290]  That's why you don't want the fruit demon.
[51:29.930 --> 51:30.670]  Cosmic Crisp!
[51:31.510 --> 51:33.430]  Cosmic Crisp, get after this.
[51:33.430 --> 51:35.050]  Let us know. We'll team up.
[51:35.230 --> 51:37.210]  I don't like this.
[51:37.930 --> 51:38.790]  Maybe it's a thing where
[51:39.430 --> 51:41.530]  every house has to
[51:41.530 --> 51:43.230]  hang a green banana
[51:43.230 --> 51:45.510]  and make sure they eat a piece of fruit
[51:45.510 --> 51:46.430]  before it goes yellow.
[51:46.730 --> 51:49.030]  He's repelled by vitamin C and potassium.
[51:52.890 --> 51:54.630]  Just a scurvy demon.
[51:55.110 --> 51:55.270]  Yeah.
[51:56.830 --> 51:57.930]  But it's pretty good.
[51:58.970 --> 52:02.030]  Anyway, let us know what your fruit demon looks like
[52:02.030 --> 52:04.210]  and then send it in or something.
[52:04.430 --> 52:06.290]  Scurvy demon tripping over banana peels.
[52:07.190 --> 52:08.030]  It's been a while
[52:08.030 --> 52:09.770]  since we've had a new demon in the zeitgeist.
[52:09.910 --> 52:11.250]  I think we're really on the side of it.
[52:11.510 --> 52:12.290]  That's a great point.
[52:13.430 --> 52:15.090]  Jack Black was just Satan, right?
[52:16.730 --> 52:17.950]  I'm trying to think of what
[52:17.950 --> 52:19.690]  the last celebrity demon was.
[52:20.090 --> 52:20.710]  It's like a movie.
[52:21.350 --> 52:23.950]  Like the South Park devil for a long time.
[52:24.550 --> 52:26.150]  Satan. He was popular
[52:26.150 --> 52:27.510]  as a South Park character.
[52:27.730 --> 52:28.610]  The insidious one?
[52:28.610 --> 52:30.950]  Remember he was like scary
[52:30.950 --> 52:33.670]  behind the Nun movies?
[52:34.290 --> 52:35.330]  Yeah, that's pretty good.
[52:35.430 --> 52:36.890]  Yeah, there's some pretty scary demons
[52:36.890 --> 52:37.430]  in the Nun.
[52:37.630 --> 52:39.430]  I think Russell Crowe fought a demon recently.
[52:39.830 --> 52:41.310]  I think that was alcoholism.
[52:43.610 --> 52:45.230]  To me, that's the scariest
[52:45.230 --> 52:46.050]  recent demon.
[52:46.430 --> 52:47.130]  Because he's hiding.
[52:48.070 --> 52:48.450]  Scary.
[52:51.430 --> 52:52.690]  Is that Darth Maul?
[52:53.170 --> 52:53.870]  Yeah, it's Darth Maul.
[52:53.930 --> 52:54.350]  I think so.
[52:55.630 --> 52:56.590]  I think that's
[52:56.590 --> 52:57.690]  Patrick Wilson being like,
[52:57.750 --> 52:58.990]  they're not making 18-2.
[52:59.230 --> 52:59.770]  What the fuck?
[53:03.470 --> 53:04.570]  That guy exists
[53:04.570 --> 53:06.650]  to make that face in every film he's in.
[53:07.110 --> 53:08.450]  Yeah, and he's good at it, baby.
[53:09.470 --> 53:10.590]  He's real good at it.
[53:10.750 --> 53:11.790]  He is good at it.
[53:11.850 --> 53:12.370]  He's a great actor.
[53:15.230 --> 53:16.770]  Gavin, do you have a demon?
[53:17.670 --> 53:18.650]  Do I have a demon?
[53:18.650 --> 53:19.990]  Yeah, because I feel like
[53:19.990 --> 53:21.810]  this is when Gavin comes in and is like,
[53:21.810 --> 53:23.010]  Oh, you've never heard of
[53:23.010 --> 53:25.970]  And it's some British demon.
[53:26.330 --> 53:27.870]  Yeah, you've never heard of the British
[53:27.870 --> 53:28.690]  cancer demon.
[53:29.090 --> 53:30.730]  I think Gavin's trying to rebuy a domain.
[53:31.730 --> 53:32.910]  No, no, I'll do that after.
[53:33.230 --> 53:33.970]  I was playing GTA.
[53:37.050 --> 53:38.070]  Is Robbie Williams
[53:38.070 --> 53:38.450]  your demon?
[53:38.970 --> 53:41.570]  No, I can't think of a British demon.
[53:41.950 --> 53:43.650]  That's what I'm curious about. I was going to bring that up
[53:43.650 --> 53:45.790]  on the show. Robbie Williams, only popular
[53:46.330 --> 53:47.470]  in the UK and Europe.
[53:47.550 --> 53:48.210]  He's a European guy.
[53:48.930 --> 53:49.970]  Canada has the
[53:49.970 --> 53:52.110]  Tragically Hip. New Zealand
[53:52.110 --> 53:54.130]  has Dave Dauben. I'd like to know what
[53:54.130 --> 53:56.370]  people's musical artists
[53:56.370 --> 53:57.910]  that are massive
[53:57.910 --> 54:00.010]  but only in their country.
[54:00.770 --> 54:02.190]  Or even area, I guess.
[54:02.790 --> 54:03.850]  Like a local legend.
[54:04.150 --> 54:06.190]  Like regionally massive?
[54:06.190 --> 54:07.850]  Like a regionally massive
[54:07.850 --> 54:10.310]  musical figure. I think those are fun.
[54:10.710 --> 54:12.130]  I bet Harry's like a country singer.
[54:12.570 --> 54:13.310]  It's what?
[54:14.290 --> 54:15.390]  A country singer?
[54:15.390 --> 54:17.430]  I think it's Garth Brooks, isn't it?
[54:18.090 --> 54:19.490]  He'd be more like Oklahoma.
[54:19.730 --> 54:20.470]  I feel like he's too popular.
[54:21.430 --> 54:23.370]  I think here it'd be...
[54:23.370 --> 54:24.770]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[54:25.170 --> 54:25.930]  The guy from San Antonio.
[54:26.310 --> 54:29.090]  I misunderstood. I thought you meant like who's
[54:29.090 --> 54:31.090]  an American that other countries don't know
[54:31.090 --> 54:32.370]  and I think that's Garth Brooks.
[54:33.170 --> 54:33.930]  Isn't that what we're saying?
[54:34.870 --> 54:36.450]  Other countries don't know Garth Brooks?
[54:36.730 --> 54:39.210]  Maybe I'm too close to make that evaluation for America.
[54:39.470 --> 54:41.550]  I think other countries know who Garth Brooks is.
[54:41.630 --> 54:43.070]  I think they don't necessarily know who
[54:43.070 --> 54:45.250]  George Strait is, who I would argue
[54:45.250 --> 54:47.250]  is as big as Garth Brooks here
[54:47.250 --> 54:48.970]  in America and certainly in Texas.
[54:49.250 --> 54:51.110]  But probably not as well known globally.
[54:51.410 --> 54:53.050]  I really do think
[54:53.050 --> 54:53.670]  it's Garth Brooks.
[54:55.190 --> 54:57.150]  This may be right because I have no idea
[54:57.150 --> 54:57.670]  who that is.
[54:59.310 --> 55:00.170]  That's a good point.
[55:00.610 --> 55:01.450]  But I'm also an idiot.
[55:02.330 --> 55:03.930]  I don't think it's that.
[55:05.550 --> 55:07.070]  I feel like Friends in Low
[55:07.070 --> 55:09.130]  Places had to have
[55:09.130 --> 55:11.070]  had some sort of presence outside of the U.S.
[55:11.070 --> 55:13.050]  Is there a thing
[55:13.050 --> 55:15.110]  that gives you culture shock more, Gavin,
[55:15.390 --> 55:17.070]  than discussing
[55:17.070 --> 55:18.590]  an established
[55:18.590 --> 55:21.150]  everybody-knows figure
[55:21.150 --> 55:22.650]  or somebody who's American
[55:22.650 --> 55:24.970]  and them having no idea who they are?
[55:25.090 --> 55:26.290]  To me, that is always
[55:26.290 --> 55:28.530]  the biggest internal reaction for me.
[55:29.090 --> 55:29.870]  Like, how the fuck?
[55:30.230 --> 55:32.010]  We truly are different cultures.
[55:32.850 --> 55:34.850]  What, when there's someone colossally famous
[55:34.850 --> 55:35.490]  and you've never heard of them?
[55:35.490 --> 55:38.830]  You just conversationally bring up somebody that you know
[55:38.830 --> 55:40.630]  as a huge figure
[55:40.630 --> 55:43.350]  and then they have no concept of who you're talking about.
[55:44.090 --> 55:45.470]  Every time it gets me.
[55:45.850 --> 55:47.450]  It's so easy to forget.
[55:47.710 --> 55:48.790]  One of my favorite conversations
[55:48.790 --> 55:50.690]  Gavin and I have ever had
[55:50.690 --> 55:52.190]  in the history of our friendship
[55:52.190 --> 55:54.870]  is we were having a very similar conversation
[55:54.870 --> 55:56.170]  where he was telling me
[55:56.170 --> 55:58.810]  there are tons of Americans that are famous
[55:58.810 --> 56:00.850]  in England that you've never heard of
[56:00.850 --> 56:02.890]  but you'll never be able
[56:02.890 --> 56:05.050]  to show me a Brit who's famous
[56:05.050 --> 56:06.850]  in America that I've never heard of.
[56:06.850 --> 56:09.130]  And the second he said that
[56:09.130 --> 56:11.390]  I went, okay, I bet I can in two seconds.
[56:11.850 --> 56:12.910]  Showed him a picture of John Oliver
[56:13.570 --> 56:14.850]  no clue who he was.
[56:14.990 --> 56:15.330]  Never heard of him.
[56:16.770 --> 56:17.990]  Are you serious?
[56:19.010 --> 56:20.150]  Gavin's like, who the fuck is that?
[56:20.190 --> 56:21.830]  And I go, it's John Oliver. He's like, I have no idea.
[56:22.150 --> 56:24.690]  And it's weird to go back now because now if you watch
[56:24.690 --> 56:26.630]  a bunch of the stuff I watched as a kid
[56:26.630 --> 56:28.410]  well, not as a kid, I guess as a teenager
[56:28.410 --> 56:31.050]  he has bit parts in everything I ever watched.
[56:31.250 --> 56:31.610]  Amazing.
[56:32.950 --> 56:34.830]  Never enough for me to ever know his name.
[56:34.830 --> 56:36.030]  That's so funny.
[56:36.450 --> 56:38.450]  For me, it's Terry Fox.
[56:38.550 --> 56:40.550]  People in America not knowing who Terry Fox is
[56:40.550 --> 56:42.670]  when he's such an established...
[56:42.670 --> 56:44.050]  It would be like not knowing
[56:44.650 --> 56:46.430]  who Michael Jordan is, essentially.
[56:46.990 --> 56:47.710]  For America.
[56:48.910 --> 56:49.430]  Everywhere.
[56:50.270 --> 56:51.970]  Did you make that up? Terry Fox?
[56:52.510 --> 56:54.790]  Yeah, fictional. Completely fictional.
[56:56.090 --> 56:56.610]  No.
[56:56.970 --> 56:58.850]  Terry Fox is a very established
[56:58.850 --> 57:00.990]  figure that you have to learn about.
[57:01.850 --> 57:03.450]  Currency all over the place.
[57:03.450 --> 57:05.770]  Is he the most beloved Canadian of all time?
[57:06.070 --> 57:07.010]  He has to be.
[57:07.330 --> 57:08.890]  Certainly in your lifetime, I would think so.
[57:09.510 --> 57:10.530]  Undeniably, yes.
[57:10.870 --> 57:11.790]  Who's the worst Canadian?
[57:13.310 --> 57:14.930]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[57:16.410 --> 57:17.750]  We taking me off the list?
[57:18.350 --> 57:19.010]  Ha ha ha!
[57:20.190 --> 57:21.570]  Can I be in the top?
[57:22.550 --> 57:23.430]  You're exempt.
[57:24.110 --> 57:24.990]  I got a pardon? Okay.
[57:25.490 --> 57:27.070]  Are there like Canadian
[57:27.070 --> 57:28.290]  serial killers?
[57:29.130 --> 57:30.470]  Oh yeah, there's some bad ones.
[57:30.470 --> 57:32.470]  Yeah, there's some bad ones.
[57:34.190 --> 57:34.910]  There's one
[57:34.910 --> 57:36.590]  locally, like not that far.
[57:36.750 --> 57:38.290]  I thought maybe he was like uniquely American.
[57:38.470 --> 57:38.830]  I don't know.
[57:39.670 --> 57:42.350]  I googled the worst Canadian, and it's just a bunch of names
[57:42.350 --> 57:44.330]  I don't know, and I don't want to say them
[57:44.330 --> 57:46.330]  because I don't want to be unintentionally
[57:46.330 --> 57:46.990]  offensive.
[57:48.210 --> 57:50.010]  Jeff, I did the exact same thing.
[57:50.390 --> 57:52.530]  I don't know who they are or why they're mentioned.
[57:52.530 --> 57:54.650]  I'm like, this guy's name is John! Ah, don't worry about it.
[57:54.710 --> 57:55.450]  You'll figure it out.
[57:55.850 --> 57:58.430]  I'm trying to think of fun, like ones that
[57:59.230 --> 58:00.690]  we don't recognize
[58:00.690 --> 58:01.130]  anymore.
[58:02.030 --> 58:04.510]  Who was that crack mayor you guys had
[58:04.510 --> 58:05.550]  for a while? He's dead, right?
[58:05.590 --> 58:06.650]  Oh, Rob Ford? Yeah, he's dead.
[58:10.530 --> 58:12.490]  There's like a silly time
[58:12.490 --> 58:13.750]  in culture where
[58:14.650 --> 58:16.290]  Justin Bieber was disavowed.
[58:16.970 --> 58:18.730]  For a very specific group of people.
[58:19.430 --> 58:19.950]  To be clear.
[58:20.890 --> 58:22.350]  Like if you're, I'd say
[58:22.350 --> 58:24.510]  a teenage guy when he was
[58:24.510 --> 58:26.090]  in his baby phase, there's definitely
[58:26.090 --> 58:28.210]  a window where Bieber was not cool.
[58:28.530 --> 58:29.490]  Now he's incredibly cool.
[58:29.890 --> 58:30.810]  Across the board.
[58:31.710 --> 58:33.210]  I'm trying to think other media
[58:34.210 --> 58:36.110]  figures. I'm having a hard time
[58:36.110 --> 58:38.010]  thinking of one that we've completely
[58:38.010 --> 58:40.170]  disowned. I'll get back to you on
[58:40.170 --> 58:42.090]  this. Because there has to be one.
[58:42.730 --> 58:43.950]  There's gotta be like a
[58:43.950 --> 58:45.570]  Canadian Jeffrey Dahmer.
[58:45.930 --> 58:47.290]  I'm trying to do in my head is
[58:48.010 --> 58:49.490]  Kevin Sorbo Canadian?
[58:50.510 --> 58:51.990]  I feel like there's gotta
[58:51.990 --> 58:54.230]  be one of those. Brian Adams?
[58:54.790 --> 58:56.350]  I don't know enough about
[58:56.350 --> 58:58.350]  Brian Adams. I think people are fine with
[58:58.350 --> 58:59.570]  Brian Adams. I think he's alright, isn't he?
[59:00.530 --> 59:02.390]  Sorbo's from Minnesota.
[59:02.550 --> 59:03.790]  He's from Minnesota. Really?
[59:04.310 --> 59:05.310]  What about Blue Cane?
[59:06.390 --> 59:08.510]  Was he just exude Canadian to you?
[59:09.630 --> 59:10.250]  I'm just
[59:10.250 --> 59:12.270]  trying to think of like these sort of like
[59:12.270 --> 59:14.250]  C-tier actors
[59:14.250 --> 59:15.430]  that seem shitty.
[59:16.010 --> 59:16.690]  Should we do
[59:18.490 --> 59:20.210]  kind of you to give Kevin
[59:20.210 --> 59:21.890]  Sorbo a C-tier? Yeah, right.
[59:21.890 --> 59:23.790]  That's very nice. The highest he's been
[59:23.790 --> 59:26.130]  in years. Should we do a most Canadian
[59:26.130 --> 59:27.290]  Americans draft?
[59:27.950 --> 59:30.110]  Ooh, most Canadian Americans.
[59:30.810 --> 59:31.910]  That's very interesting.
[59:32.290 --> 59:33.530]  It's a very interesting one.
[59:33.710 --> 59:35.050]  Obviously, Sorbo would be a
[59:35.670 --> 59:37.330]  great pick. I don't know. We don't want him.
[59:37.890 --> 59:39.790]  Can we just pick Canadians who
[59:39.790 --> 59:41.790]  gave up their Canadian citizenship to be Americans?
[59:43.250 --> 59:43.950]  That could
[59:43.950 --> 59:45.490]  be fun as a draft.
[59:46.810 --> 59:47.110]  Yeah.
[59:47.570 --> 59:49.710]  It could be
[59:49.710 --> 59:51.670]  Nick, Eric, and
[59:51.670 --> 59:53.670]  Jeff on one team and then Gavin and I
[59:53.670 --> 59:55.650]  as our own teams for different countries
[59:55.650 --> 59:57.910]  and doing like a reassigning of people.
[59:58.750 --> 59:59.730]  But we're on opposite
[59:59.730 --> 01:00:00.390]  sides of the table.
[01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:03.830]  What if we just did
[01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:04.610]  best Canadians?
[01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:07.770]  Like a best Canadian draft?
[01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:09.850]  Like Jim Carrey, Seth Rogen.
[01:00:10.090 --> 01:00:11.470]  We could do each for each country.
[01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:13.210]  We could do best Americans, best Canadians,
[01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:14.250]  best Brits.
[01:00:15.130 --> 01:00:15.810]  Best Brits?
[01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:18.210]  Samantha Fox,
[01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:20.270]  all the Page 3 girls.
[01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.210]  Yeah, dude. Best Brits is
[01:00:22.210 --> 01:00:23.730]  going to be a way different list. That's all.
[01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:26.330]  I'm just going to draft Gavin's childhood wall.
[01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:28.130]  Kelly Brook, Katie Price
[01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:28.690]  sort of stuff.
[01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:32.550]  Dude, those names were off the rip.
[01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:33.330]  Damn.
[01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:35.690]  Kelly Brook was on my wall.
[01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:38.190]  I was going to say this
[01:00:38.190 --> 01:00:40.130]  the other day. If we ever get an office, I think we should
[01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:42.210]  have to put those Gavin posters
[01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:43.790]  somewhere on the wall.
[01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:45.210]  So we've got the
[01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:47.730]  lesbians, Kelly Brook
[01:00:47.730 --> 01:00:49.510]  obviously. Tattoo, is that what they were called?
[01:00:49.930 --> 01:00:51.610]  I don't think it was actually tattoo though.
[01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:52.970]  No, it's that
[01:00:54.330 --> 01:00:55.810]  the black and white girls
[01:00:55.810 --> 01:00:56.850]  kissing poster, right?
[01:00:57.090 --> 01:00:58.670]  Every dorm room had.
[01:01:00.070 --> 01:01:01.730]  I don't think I want that
[01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:03.870]  in my place of work.
[01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:04.870]  Why not?
[01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:07.830]  It's so Gavin's parents don't think he's gay.
[01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:11.570]  As a joke, we're going to
[01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:13.670]  send Gavin all of those
[01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:15.430]  I was going to send him his wall
[01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:16.570]  for Christmas.
[01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:18.690]  I did a lot of research
[01:01:19.570 --> 01:01:21.530]  and it is not
[01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:23.230]  an authorized Kelly Brook poster.
[01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:25.190]  You cannot just find that.
[01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:27.890]  The image is from
[01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:29.810]  a photoshoot
[01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:31.590]  she did for Nuts magazine
[01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:33.490]  but that version
[01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:35.730]  of that poster is not like
[01:01:35.730 --> 01:01:37.370]  that was somebody
[01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:39.390]  I think just sold that.
[01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:41.450]  Gavin's buying counterfeit merchandise.
[01:01:41.590 --> 01:01:43.830]  No, I got that from the big poster wall at HMV.
[01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:46.010]  It's like you're reading a big book.
[01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:46.770]  Yeah.
[01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:48.090]  No, totally.
[01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:51.590]  Whatever company licensed
[01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:52.690]  that for that thing
[01:01:53.130 --> 01:01:55.590]  doesn't exist. That poster no longer exists.
[01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:57.770]  Oh, shit. Well, my apologies to Kelly Brook.
[01:01:57.770 --> 01:01:59.290]  And then you had a J-Lo poster
[01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:01.270]  which I had to try to figure out. That also is
[01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:02.910]  an HMV one, I assume.
[01:02:03.370 --> 01:02:05.270]  It's in the same category of like
[01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:07.690]  that photo exists in multiple ways
[01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:09.790]  but trying to find the exact specific
[01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:11.450]  one you have. Not easy.
[01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:13.650]  Boy, what am I going to pick
[01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:15.510]  for today's thumbnail? I have so many options.
[01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:18.270]  I think I'm going to pick the tongue, honestly.
[01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:19.590]  Honestly, for me,
[01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:21.810]  I still, I vote for that picture
[01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:23.610]  of Dan. I just think that's like the worst
[01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:25.590]  picture of a human man I've ever seen.
[01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:27.450]  He looks so sad in there.
[01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:30.270]  Yeah, he is just really in there, man.
[01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:31.990]  He must have been spent, you know?
[01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:32.250]  Yeah.
[01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:35.850]  Alright, we should
[01:02:35.850 --> 01:02:37.010]  start wrapping this one up.
[01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:40.010]  Did we cover everything we were supposed to cover
[01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:41.890]  today? We talked about the Gerplers,
[01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:43.850]  we talked about the sign drop,
[01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:45.910]  we talked about how people should join the Discord
[01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:46.790]  and pick
[01:02:48.070 --> 01:02:49.050]  if they are
[01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:51.850]  scrumpers or falconeers
[01:02:51.850 --> 01:02:53.850]  and then, what happens exactly, Andrew?
[01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:55.970]  The winning side gets some sort of
[01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:57.730]  a roll? The winning side gets to keep their roll, yes.
[01:02:58.150 --> 01:03:00.150]  Okay. So you'll have a special badge
[01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:01.530]  on the server, essentially.
[01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:03.850]  That's pretty cool. You better pick right, I guess.
[01:03:03.850 --> 01:03:05.210]  Yeah, don't be wrong.
[01:03:06.490 --> 01:03:07.210]  Falcons, baby!
[01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:09.230]  Fuck it up!
[01:03:09.550 --> 01:03:10.070]  It's gonna be scrumping.
[01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:14.030]  You're gonna pick fucking scrumper and you're gonna be watching falcons
[01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:15.730]  chatting away for the rest of their lives.
[01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:16.230]  Yeah!
[01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:18.350]  Look at the falcons fly!
[01:03:20.110 --> 01:03:20.950]  That's my falcon.
[01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:23.530]  And you're gonna be like, it's not even a falcon, it's a hawk.
[01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:25.890]  This is stupid. At least the scrumping was an apple.
[01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:27.010]  That's good.
[01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:28.570]  Gavin, that's how you sound.
[01:03:31.830 --> 01:03:32.930]  Okay, so if Eric
[01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:33.990]  currently has the reins,
[01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:35.910]  who can reach them?
[01:03:36.550 --> 01:03:38.090]  I can. I just want to take...
[01:03:38.090 --> 01:03:40.430]  Eric, I'm gonna take them for one second, then I'm gonna give them back to you.
[01:03:40.770 --> 01:03:42.650]  I definitely felt like
[01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:44.490]  Geoff had the reins. I didn't.
[01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:47.150]  Did it feel like I had the reins?
[01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:48.850]  I'm just listening to what Gavin told me.
[01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:50.110]  You were saying something. You were talking.
[01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:51.630]  Gavin told me you had them.
[01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:53.930]  What am I holding?
[01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:57.170]  Wait, Geoff does have...
[01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:59.430]  This is such a good show.
[01:03:59.470 --> 01:04:01.170]  Why don't we try and do a whole episode
[01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:03.030]  where you can only talk
[01:04:03.030 --> 01:04:05.310]  if you can take it from the person
[01:04:05.310 --> 01:04:06.630]  next to you.
[01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:09.330]  So, Andrew, you can only talk
[01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:10.930]  if Eric or Geoff just talked.
[01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:17.230]  See, now Nick and Geoff
[01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:18.670]  are both laughing, so I can talk.
[01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:22.050]  Well, there you have it.
[01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:23.470]  Another episode
[01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:25.490]  of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:27.190]  Will we do an episode
[01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:29.590]  where you can only talk if the adjacent person
[01:04:29.590 --> 01:04:31.550]  next to you is speaking? I have a feeling
[01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:33.430]  we'll probably forget about that immediately.
[01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:35.850]  But maybe we won't. We might actually do it.
[01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:37.410]  Maybe it'll become the most popular thing
[01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:39.210]  we've ever done, and we'll do it monthly.
[01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:41.450]  Maybe it's the new Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:43.610]  Which, by the way, we should schedule and do
[01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:45.010]  sometime soon, because it's been a minute.
[01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:47.470]  Thanks for listening. We love you.
[01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:49.450]  Rate and review and subscribe.
[01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:51.210]  Join our Discord.
[01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:53.270]  Join our YouTube channels.
[01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:55.110]  We have two. They are also free.
[01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:56.470]  One for the Regulation Podcast,
[01:04:57.010 --> 01:04:59.230]  one for Regulation Gameplay. Andrew, you
[01:04:59.230 --> 01:05:01.770]  sound like you'd like the reins. Let me go ahead and turn them over to you.
[01:05:01.850 --> 01:05:03.170]  Oh, thank you. I'm holding the reins.
[01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:05.110]  Yeah, I think, you know what?
[01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:07.330]  It could be interesting for this to work with the talking
[01:05:07.330 --> 01:05:09.430]  thing, is we just do the order in which
[01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:10.930]  we've joined in our call
[01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:13.130]  on Discord. So once I
[01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:15.310]  finish talking, then Eric can talk.
[01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:17.150]  Yeah, but that's
[01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:19.490]  completely different from the mind
[01:05:19.490 --> 01:05:19.930]  table.
[01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:22.090]  Well, it's just a visual
[01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:24.010]  representation, and it goes up and
[01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:26.010]  down. Alright, let's try and do that for
[01:05:26.010 --> 01:05:28.010]  the outro. Okay, well, thank you so much
[01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.570]  for listening.
[01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:35.930]  I think it has to be Eric next?
[01:05:36.330 --> 01:05:38.430]  Yeah. I was told I don't
[01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:40.510]  have to talk. I think you
[01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:42.590]  have to. How do I know if I'm allowed to talk?
[01:05:42.810 --> 01:05:43.850]  Okay, we fucked it up. We fucked up the line.
[01:05:44.290 --> 01:05:45.150]  No, you just said...
[01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:48.070]  I'm gonna go, then Eric's gonna go,
[01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:49.910]  then Dev is gonna go, then Jeff's gonna go,
[01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:52.250]  then Nick's gonna go. And we're ending it too.
[01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:53.950]  You don't have the reins. I have the reins.
[01:05:55.350 --> 01:05:55.910]  Now you have the reins.
[01:05:56.170 --> 01:05:58.110]  But now you're done, because now I'm talking.
[01:05:58.330 --> 01:06:00.030]  So now Gavin can do it. Yoink!
[01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:02.250]  Shut up, Eric. And that's it
[01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:04.210]  for another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:06.310]  One last thing, before I turn it over
[01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:07.470]  to Nick, who takes us out,
[01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:10.310]  we'll do it live. Go ahead and send
[01:06:10.310 --> 01:06:12.230]  us in your mind table. I'd love to know
[01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:14.250]  what the podcast seating arrangement looks like
[01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:16.190]  in your head. That's it
[01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:17.490]  for Jeff. Nick?
[01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:20.410]  Bye! No one knows
[01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:22.050]  what order this is.
[01:06:22.250 --> 01:06:23.330]  They never see this part.
[01:06:23.330 --> 01:06:25.970]  It has to be Andrew. It flips back to Andrew.
[01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:27.850]  It's alphabetical! What?
[01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:29.910]  Oh, it is alphabetical.
[01:06:30.590 --> 01:06:32.490]  Oh, shit. Oh, I never noticed
[01:06:32.490 --> 01:06:34.150]  that. It's
[01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.650]  eggs.
[01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:38.370]  It is, it's A
[01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:39.610]  eggs. Yep. Eggs.
[01:06:40.050 --> 01:06:42.050]  Alright, see you next time, bye! See you next time, love you, bye!
[01:06:42.050 --> 01:06:42.630]  Love you, bye.
