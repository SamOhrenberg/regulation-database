[00:30.660 --> 00:36.140]  Hello and welcome to Regulation Podcast episode number 45. I'm your temporary host,
[00:36.380 --> 00:41.400]  The Mechanic, joined by baby Pepsi, Gassy Goo, Gizmo, and little Ricky B.
[00:42.680 --> 00:46.360]  As always, thanks for joining us this week. Guys, did you know that you can inhale popcorn?
[00:51.180 --> 00:54.380]  You can eat it through your lung? What do you mean?
[00:54.520 --> 00:59.560]  Yeah, so if you're eating it and you take it in wrong, if you inhale at the moment,
[00:59.560 --> 01:02.820]  you can take a kernel and then suck it into your lung.
[01:02.980 --> 01:03.880]  Are you referring to the seed?
[01:04.600 --> 01:08.660]  Yeah, uh, like the little bit in the middle. I mean, you could probably do a whole one if
[01:08.660 --> 01:13.140]  you wanted to, but the bit in the middle. The bit in the middle is the bit that you eat, though.
[01:13.580 --> 01:15.900]  Well, yeah, but you can also inhale it. Yeah, it's light as air.
[01:16.260 --> 01:16.500]  Right.
[01:16.880 --> 01:19.040]  So you'll say you can inhale a whole kernel?
[01:19.500 --> 01:23.060]  You can inhale a whole kernel and can get very sick and apparently succeed.
[01:23.240 --> 01:26.400]  Yeah, and then corn grows in your stomach and you die. I heard about this.
[01:27.080 --> 01:30.780]  Now, Nick, is there corn growing in your stomach right now?
[01:31.080 --> 01:35.100]  Not at the moment, no, but I did also... listen, my wife is on a big kick about learning about
[01:35.100 --> 01:39.000]  foods because, you know, kids and eating all that stuff. And the other thing, apparently,
[01:39.100 --> 01:41.720]  that you can die on the easiest is a hot dog.
[01:41.880 --> 01:42.480]  Y'all are eating kids?
[01:43.660 --> 01:44.060]  What?
[01:44.460 --> 01:45.340]  I said kids and eating.
[01:46.140 --> 01:47.200]  Kids and eating? Eating kids?
[01:47.480 --> 01:47.980]  Eating kids.
[01:48.420 --> 01:52.680]  So you're just... your wife's looking for things not to feed Archie so he doesn't die?
[01:53.120 --> 01:57.620]  Essentially, we did find out because he had his first hot dog this past weekend. I was
[01:57.620 --> 02:01.080]  pretty proud and excited. I'm going to get him a counter here pretty soon. Make sure he keeps up
[02:01.080 --> 02:08.720]  with the rest of us. But apparently, that's the craziest. This kid's like three. Yo,
[02:08.740 --> 02:10.360]  some of you eat your 80 hot dogs or what?
[02:10.700 --> 02:14.400]  No, but this is great because most people don't know how many hot dogs they've eaten in their life.
[02:14.780 --> 02:15.940]  And you actually could.
[02:16.620 --> 02:18.600]  He gets to start from scratch.
[02:18.620 --> 02:20.360]  Give him life stats on dogs.
[02:20.700 --> 02:21.100]  Insane.
[02:21.160 --> 02:21.740]  Oh, my God.
[02:21.740 --> 02:26.880]  Teach him from an early age about the lifetime hot dog counter and how it's his responsibility
[02:26.880 --> 02:28.800]  to keep up with it.
[02:29.120 --> 02:33.300]  It does make sense, though, that you're most likely to choke on a dog because eating a hot
[02:33.300 --> 02:35.500]  dog is like eating an inverse throat.
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.360]  Yes, it's the exact same size as your throat. So most people, like, cut it down the middle,
[02:40.480 --> 02:43.220]  which is why some restaurants serve it that way and some restaurants just serve it that way
[02:43.220 --> 02:44.420]  because they cook it that way.
[02:44.540 --> 02:46.940]  Otherwise, you're just eating a cooked throat plug.
[02:47.220 --> 02:48.960]  It is. It's like the pile to the hole.
[02:49.740 --> 02:52.300]  How high would you say Archie could count, Nick?
[02:52.880 --> 02:53.600]  I don't know, 20s.
[02:54.480 --> 02:55.660]  Well, he's ahead of you, Andrew.
[02:56.560 --> 02:58.460]  Uh, about 80s, 90s.
[02:59.160 --> 03:02.220]  I just I appreciate that Archie lives in a world.
[03:02.320 --> 03:02.580]  I don't know.
[03:03.320 --> 03:06.380]  Remember the Mr. Show sketch where, like, 23 is the highest number.
[03:06.680 --> 03:07.680]  That's going to be Archie.
[03:07.940 --> 03:10.960]  He's going to have 23 hot dogs in a calendar year and be like, that's it.
[03:11.220 --> 03:11.960]  I've gone the highest.
[03:12.180 --> 03:12.560]  I've peaked.
[03:13.600 --> 03:15.440]  If I eat another hot dog, it just isn't a number.
[03:15.560 --> 03:16.580]  We have to invent something else.
[03:16.580 --> 03:22.300]  If you said I had 23 hot dogs left to eat total, I think I'd be fine with that.
[03:22.440 --> 03:22.800]  Like in your life?
[03:22.800 --> 03:25.020]  Yeah, that would mean that you lived 5,000 years.
[03:28.320 --> 03:31.720]  You went to $1 hot dog night and had one hot dog.
[03:32.060 --> 03:33.740]  Gavin just found his secret to immortality.
[03:34.820 --> 03:36.660]  I just never eat the 23rd dog.
[03:38.700 --> 03:41.580]  It'll be 50 years before you eat the third dog, for Christ's sake.
[03:43.160 --> 03:47.120]  Nick, I gotta say, buddy, I thought that was a fantastic intro.
[03:47.240 --> 03:50.920]  Anytime you want to step in and do the intro again, the floor is yours.
[03:51.300 --> 03:51.440]  Really?
[03:51.440 --> 03:52.960]  I'll let you know when I have a factoid next.
[03:53.140 --> 03:53.440]  All right.
[03:53.760 --> 03:55.940]  It reminded me of Kermit the Frog a little bit for some reason.
[03:56.040 --> 03:59.640]  I don't know why, but it kind of gave me some Kermit vibes on The Muppet Show and I liked it.
[03:59.720 --> 04:01.300]  I kind of don't want to do it now, I guess.
[04:01.960 --> 04:03.460]  Welcome to Regulation Podcast.
[04:03.840 --> 04:05.780]  I think Nick is feeling on top of the world.
[04:06.000 --> 04:06.880]  That was crazy.
[04:09.020 --> 04:11.340]  Also, he's given away the fact that he's not wearing the mask.
[04:11.580 --> 04:12.500]  So I feel like...
[04:12.500 --> 04:13.040]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:13.040 --> 04:14.820]  Oh, wow, what a trick.
[04:15.200 --> 04:16.040]  We tricked you there a little bit.
[04:16.420 --> 04:17.060]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:18.060 --> 04:20.280]  Is that what you thought Kermit the Frog sounded like, Nick?
[04:21.360 --> 04:21.720]  No.
[04:28.660 --> 04:30.840]  Sounds like the aragatai in that show we watched.
[04:35.540 --> 04:37.200]  Are you Mr. Smith?
[04:41.120 --> 04:42.640]  Kermit's last name is actually Smith.
[04:43.560 --> 04:44.440]  Oh, Christ.
[04:45.120 --> 04:47.240]  Uh, what do you guys want to talk about today?
[04:47.320 --> 04:48.440]  Does anybody have anything on their list?
[04:48.600 --> 04:49.080]  Are you kidding?
[04:49.180 --> 04:51.100]  You guys have been locked and loaded all week.
[04:51.180 --> 04:52.740]  Somebody just throw something out there.
[04:52.820 --> 04:55.440]  Well, I got two things, but I want to give everybody else the floor first.
[04:55.880 --> 04:58.900]  Gavin, last time we recorded said he didn't hit any of his notes.
[04:59.020 --> 05:00.400]  I feel like Gavin should...
[05:00.400 --> 05:01.740]  Gavin, lead us off, buddy.
[05:02.560 --> 05:04.400]  Mail my semen to every house.
[05:04.480 --> 05:05.120]  What do I mean by that?
[05:06.760 --> 05:09.520]  Dude, all right, so no more Gavin notes ever.
[05:10.180 --> 05:10.860]  Move on, I guess.
[05:11.260 --> 05:13.020]  Mail my semen to every...
[05:13.020 --> 05:14.720]  Let's linger on this for a minute.
[05:15.620 --> 05:17.400]  This is my crime thing.
[05:17.680 --> 05:21.180]  Like if my semen was everywhere, I could never be caught for a crime.
[05:21.300 --> 05:24.340]  But then I realized all of the semen-based crimes are really not fun.
[05:24.860 --> 05:28.220]  Yeah, why would you want to cover up a semen-based crime?
[05:31.480 --> 05:34.580]  It would make more sense if you decided to go touch
[05:34.580 --> 05:37.120]  a doorknob at every house in America or something.
[05:37.120 --> 05:39.580]  Yeah, like it should be mailing my fingerprints to every house.
[05:39.880 --> 05:42.900]  But you took it to sexual assault pretty quickly.
[05:43.400 --> 05:45.020]  It could have also been murder, I guess.
[05:45.440 --> 05:47.620]  Have you seen... have you seen the town?
[05:48.300 --> 05:51.540]  Remember how like they do the heist and then they like get a bunch of different
[05:51.540 --> 05:55.040]  hair from a barbershop of like various people to like fuck up the DNA?
[05:55.600 --> 06:00.440]  Like what you're suggesting is like a bag of cum, but it's a bunch of different dudes cum.
[06:01.060 --> 06:02.360]  Throw the cum bomb in.
[06:02.440 --> 06:04.960]  So it's like there's an orgy of dudes here.
[06:05.100 --> 06:07.600]  How do we... whose DNA is whose?
[06:07.740 --> 06:09.880]  I was just trying to get... I was just trying to blanket my DNA.
[06:10.420 --> 06:12.120]  Yeah, I don't think... because what you're actually doing
[06:12.120 --> 06:16.660]  with your initial suggestion is putting yourself as a suspect in every single crime.
[06:16.980 --> 06:18.860]  Yeah, but they'll be like, oh, it's this guy again.
[06:19.200 --> 06:21.280]  Yeah, I can build a reputation.
[06:21.420 --> 06:23.940]  They would get real sick of interviewing you after about two weeks.
[06:25.200 --> 06:28.060]  Where were you last night? I was here being interviewed by you.
[06:31.140 --> 06:33.020]  How did his cum get to California?
[06:34.660 --> 06:35.060]  Insane.
[06:36.120 --> 06:37.400]  Gavin, what else you got besides cum?
[06:37.820 --> 06:40.240]  I want to know because Nick is a freak, right?
[06:40.240 --> 06:42.020]  We've been learning this a lot more recently.
[06:42.340 --> 06:47.000]  I want to know if Nick and Eric ever just hang out one-on-one.
[06:48.660 --> 06:50.560]  When have we done that? When have we...
[06:51.240 --> 06:54.380]  Very different answers. Very different answers just out the gate.
[06:54.380 --> 06:58.180]  I invited you to a soccer game, but you weren't able to go,
[06:58.320 --> 07:03.040]  which was also good because I wasn't able to go because it felt like I got hit by a bus.
[07:03.320 --> 07:04.000]  Wait, what?
[07:04.680 --> 07:07.380]  That was on Saturday, so...
[07:07.380 --> 07:08.260]  That was barbecue day.
[07:08.260 --> 07:14.800]  Yeah, that was a lot, but we've gone to basketball games.
[07:15.120 --> 07:18.620]  Yeah, and we used to go to lunch when we were all in the same office.
[07:18.700 --> 07:20.640]  But just you and him at lunch?
[07:20.700 --> 07:22.040]  Yeah, just the two of you.
[07:22.160 --> 07:24.440]  Yeah, we've done stuff like that before.
[07:24.680 --> 07:26.880]  Yeah, me and Nick get along really well. We're sports guys.
[07:27.180 --> 07:29.260]  We have stuff that we can talk about like that forever.
[07:29.540 --> 07:34.180]  Would you be willing to do it again for us and record the...
[07:34.180 --> 07:36.200]  Not anyone to watch, I just want to listen to the conversation.
[07:36.200 --> 07:37.800]  You guys just put a Zoom recorder down?
[07:38.700 --> 07:42.700]  How much more fun would it be if we were in like a different car park with binoculars
[07:42.700 --> 07:44.840]  and we had a mic on that table?
[07:45.200 --> 07:48.500]  Is that what you think fun is? Is that what you do for fun?
[07:48.620 --> 07:49.480]  Does that sound fun? Yes.
[07:49.740 --> 07:52.520]  How do we record? No, no, I'm into this. I'm 100% into this.
[07:52.580 --> 07:54.340]  How do we record the binocular view?
[07:54.940 --> 07:57.920]  Oh, you can get binoculars with a sensor in, I think.
[07:57.960 --> 07:59.260]  Oh, like smart binoculars.
[07:59.560 --> 07:59.660]  Yeah.
[08:01.200 --> 08:07.960]  Oh, can we do can we do a bird's eye lunch of Nick and Eric where we get smart binoculars?
[08:08.120 --> 08:10.460]  Can we actually do this? This could be a this could be a supplemental.
[08:11.220 --> 08:13.320]  Yeah, I mean, I don't I don't know that it's a very good supplemental,
[08:13.480 --> 08:14.760]  but we could definitely do it.
[08:14.860 --> 08:17.740]  Well, it could be we could all be mics like Jeff and I could
[08:17.740 --> 08:20.240]  sometimes talk about what you guys are talking about.
[08:20.900 --> 08:22.340]  Why do you want to cook their lunch?
[08:22.680 --> 08:25.020]  Yeah, I don't. Yeah, it's really something.
[08:25.360 --> 08:26.280]  No, I'm into this.
[08:26.280 --> 08:29.340]  Lunch cooks. I think they're cooking themselves.
[08:29.800 --> 08:33.820]  We could bring a couple of like packed lunches to watch you eat.
[08:34.240 --> 08:37.880]  Yeah, once again, this is only makes it weirder. I feel like this is you've
[08:37.880 --> 08:39.840]  you've turned this into a weird you thing.
[08:39.960 --> 08:41.480]  No, it'd be like a stakeout podcast.
[08:41.900 --> 08:44.720]  Yes, yes, this is a stakeout podcast.
[08:44.960 --> 08:48.280]  Speaking of steaks, we should get steaks. You guys watch us through the window.
[08:48.500 --> 08:49.320]  Yeah, I'm finally getting steaks.
[08:49.440 --> 08:55.520]  I feel like a key part of the stakeout is that the people being staked aren't aware of the stakeout.
[08:55.520 --> 08:56.840]  Well, here's here's the thing.
[08:57.160 --> 08:59.160]  Maybe they won't know which lunch we're perving on.
[08:59.460 --> 09:03.120]  Also, Andrew, sometimes in the movie, they are aware of the stakeout and they're feeding
[09:03.120 --> 09:05.560]  false information. So yeah, we don't know.
[09:05.840 --> 09:09.540]  Someone could be sneaking around behind us and putting a banana up our car.
[09:09.920 --> 09:12.280]  Here's what we do. They exactly. Axel Foley style.
[09:12.700 --> 09:15.740]  They they eat steak for lunch.
[09:15.860 --> 09:20.080]  We watch and record while we eat Philly cheesesteaks in the car.
[09:20.780 --> 09:21.920]  Philly cheesesteak out.
[09:22.380 --> 09:23.460]  Yeah, a Philly cheesesteak out.
[09:25.640 --> 09:29.220]  I love this because I'm just fascinated to find out what you talk about.
[09:29.320 --> 09:31.420]  Uh, I'm going to put it on. I'm going to put it on the ideal list.
[09:31.540 --> 09:32.240]  Hold on. Yeah, yeah, put it.
[09:32.340 --> 09:33.880]  Yeah, let's do it.
[09:33.960 --> 09:36.720]  You really find it hard to imagine what Nick and Eric would talk about?
[09:36.840 --> 09:37.820]  I feel like it's so easy.
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.920]  Yeah, that's, I think, more a reflection of you than them.
[09:42.440 --> 09:43.880]  Well, Gavin's not like a sports guy.
[09:44.040 --> 09:46.560]  That's what I'm saying. Like, I think he just doesn't get that.
[09:47.160 --> 09:47.280]  Yeah.
[09:48.260 --> 09:52.280]  Yeah, I don't think I've ever spoken to anyone about sport.
[09:52.940 --> 09:53.300]  Interesting.
[09:53.620 --> 09:54.380]  That's what I'm saying.
[09:54.380 --> 09:57.040]  I think it's a deeper well than you're realizing.
[09:57.460 --> 10:01.380]  I think it's going to be a fascinating window into the relationship of the two.
[10:01.480 --> 10:05.680]  Your general interest, Gavin, which would you say you'd be able to talk the longest about?
[10:06.140 --> 10:08.020]  Just like you're dropped in a scenario.
[10:08.380 --> 10:10.360]  What is the most ideal thing?
[10:10.660 --> 10:12.940]  You end up in a lunch with somebody that you don't really know.
[10:13.280 --> 10:16.140]  What subject could you go the longest on?
[10:16.520 --> 10:18.300]  Well, I don't even know if he's ever going to do that.
[10:19.360 --> 10:21.000]  He could talk about his RVB fandom.
[10:22.560 --> 10:25.540]  So are you saying what sport or what subject in general?
[10:25.720 --> 10:28.400]  What subjects? Because Nick and Eric have sports.
[10:28.400 --> 10:30.460]  That's like they could just go forever on that. That's easy.
[10:30.580 --> 10:30.980]  And radio.
[10:31.220 --> 10:31.780]  Yeah, radio.
[10:31.780 --> 10:36.820]  If you get, I'm saying for you, what would be your equivalent of sports socially?
[10:37.420 --> 10:38.360]  But who am I talking to?
[10:38.900 --> 10:40.860]  Anybody. It doesn't really matter.
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.340]  Someone that like what is in the same way that you're like,
[10:45.380 --> 10:46.680]  I don't know what they'll talk about.
[10:46.720 --> 10:49.420]  And we're saying they talk sports. It's really easy to talk sports.
[10:49.420 --> 10:51.980]  What would be the subject that would be your sports?
[10:52.120 --> 10:52.960]  What is your sports?
[10:53.720 --> 10:54.300]  Movies, games.
[10:55.200 --> 10:56.120]  Movies, games. Okay.
[10:56.460 --> 10:58.240]  Cameras. I would feel like you could talk about frame rate.
[10:59.140 --> 10:59.460]  Wow.
[11:00.000 --> 11:01.260]  Law of reciprocity.
[11:01.820 --> 11:03.340]  Who's going to talk to me about frame rate though?
[11:03.880 --> 11:05.420]  Some person that we're inventing.
[11:07.380 --> 11:08.380]  120? Oh my God.
[11:08.600 --> 11:09.520]  59.9?
[11:10.060 --> 11:10.980]  Tell me, teach me.
[11:11.080 --> 11:13.060]  Oh, maybe this is what I'll talk to Nick about if we ever have lunch.
[11:14.060 --> 11:15.280]  Oh, let's have lunch.
[11:15.500 --> 11:17.960]  That's got to be and we have to record that because that's your show, right?
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.400]  We have to figure out what your show is.
[11:19.420 --> 11:20.700]  You guys are going to have lunch.
[11:20.860 --> 11:23.840]  We have to be in a car outside watching with binoculars recording it.
[11:23.880 --> 11:30.080]  I think of all of the people on this show, it is easily Gavin and Nick are the one that
[11:30.080 --> 11:31.820]  I'm most interested in.
[11:31.940 --> 11:32.820]  A hundred percent.
[11:32.920 --> 11:34.200]  I'm not sure where that would go.
[11:34.200 --> 11:36.160]  It's the combination that's had the least time.
[11:36.500 --> 11:36.760]  Yes.
[11:37.040 --> 11:41.260]  Maybe this show is just every iteration of all of us eating lunch.
[11:41.440 --> 11:44.520]  And then once we get through it, then the series is over.
[11:45.020 --> 11:48.740]  Eric, when you and I eat lunch together, I'm going to endeavor not to open my mouth to
[11:48.740 --> 11:50.040]  speak at the entire time.
[11:51.240 --> 11:52.380]  Why would we do?
[11:52.520 --> 11:53.400]  Why would you do that?
[11:53.400 --> 11:55.120]  Because I think you and I could pull it off.
[11:55.360 --> 11:58.420]  I think we could do it.
[11:58.540 --> 11:59.880]  This stakeout is exhausting.
[12:00.180 --> 12:04.200]  I do think stakeout, stakeout is a good idea where we eat steaks and the two other people
[12:04.200 --> 12:05.240]  eat chili cheese steaks.
[12:05.760 --> 12:06.100]  Cheese steak out?
[12:06.100 --> 12:07.840]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:08.200 --> 12:09.280]  This is a good idea.
[12:09.420 --> 12:10.100]  A great idea.
[12:10.260 --> 12:11.420]  Yeah, man.
[12:11.720 --> 12:13.620]  I got some other great ideas for you guys today, too.
[12:15.680 --> 12:18.520]  Well, Gavin's trying to mail us cum, so it's got to be better than that.
[12:18.520 --> 12:20.020]  Yeah, absolutely.
[12:20.440 --> 12:24.100]  Speaking of receiving things in the mail, we had a great loss that you guys don't know about.
[12:24.560 --> 12:27.200]  I lost something for the show for us that I bought.
[12:27.400 --> 12:32.960]  I was excited to share, you know, in a better way than the way in which I'm doing it now.
[12:33.320 --> 12:36.920]  But I'm thinking about content coming up in the future.
[12:37.160 --> 12:38.860]  You're going to get this.
[12:39.000 --> 12:40.560]  Trust me, trust me.
[12:40.600 --> 12:41.160]  No question.
[12:42.580 --> 12:44.900]  This is something I wanted to reveal in a better way.
[12:45.240 --> 12:46.200]  I can't question it.
[12:46.240 --> 12:47.460]  I don't know what the fuck you said.
[12:48.080 --> 12:49.600]  I said that I'm revealing it now.
[12:49.660 --> 12:53.540]  I wanted to reveal this in better terms than the terms that I am.
[12:54.560 --> 13:00.420]  But I bought something because we were coming up on when we would do another big movie battle.
[13:00.740 --> 13:05.100]  And to add to the excitement of the battle, I wanted to get trophies.
[13:05.180 --> 13:06.280]  So we'd have something on the line.
[13:06.680 --> 13:10.160]  So I've been looking at different things I could use as a trophy.
[13:10.160 --> 13:15.080]  And I ordered something that I thought would be the absolute best prize to receive.
[13:15.080 --> 13:17.220]  If you came in dead last.
[13:17.800 --> 13:21.500]  And that is... let me put a photo of it in our chat.
[13:22.540 --> 13:23.960]  Is it a vial of Gavin's cum?
[13:25.260 --> 13:26.060]  You know what?
[13:26.160 --> 13:29.220]  Surprisingly hard to find, considering it was mailed everywhere.
[13:29.780 --> 13:30.800]  I couldn't get it.
[13:31.060 --> 13:41.220]  So no, it is an even more rare item of a graded copy of The Big Bounce on VHS that is still sealed.
[13:41.980 --> 13:42.520]  What is that?
[13:43.160 --> 13:45.000]  What's the Big Bounce?
[13:45.380 --> 13:46.320]  That's the trophy?
[13:46.560 --> 13:54.460]  Yes, I thought nothing would better represent last place than a mid-2000s crime comedy
[13:55.060 --> 13:57.560]  on VHS that's sealed and graded.
[13:58.160 --> 14:04.800]  The bad news of why I'm unveiling this now is it was stolen from my doorstop while still in the package.
[14:06.040 --> 14:07.760]  And I just cannot.
[14:07.960 --> 14:10.440]  I keep thinking about it ever since it happened.
[14:10.440 --> 14:11.480]  That somebody...
[14:12.900 --> 14:18.740]  Somebody stole a package from my front door, assuming something of value would be in it.
[14:18.820 --> 14:25.840]  And to open it to discover The Big Bounce on VHS, graded.
[14:26.300 --> 14:29.620]  I really just want to know what's going on in their head.
[14:30.620 --> 14:33.840]  I wonder if they thought it would have value because it is graded.
[14:34.220 --> 14:36.380]  It costs $30 to buy that.
[14:36.660 --> 14:39.380]  I've never seen a graded thing be cheaper.
[14:40.440 --> 14:44.400]  So I was very excited to have this, but it's gone.
[14:44.600 --> 14:45.940]  Someone stole The Big Bounce.
[14:46.420 --> 14:47.220]  How do you know it's stolen?
[14:48.620 --> 14:49.700]  I don't know.
[14:50.100 --> 14:54.360]  You should check eBay Canada to see if that magically shows up in the next couple of days.
[14:54.660 --> 14:58.740]  I should, but I'm glad that you guys don't really know what The Big Bounce is.
[14:59.260 --> 15:02.400]  It's a movie I remember renting when it came out and not liking.
[15:02.860 --> 15:04.540]  And that's all I remember about it.
[15:04.760 --> 15:09.660]  This movie came out in 2004, and it looks like something I wouldn't like then, nor would I like
[15:09.660 --> 15:10.160]  it now.
[15:10.720 --> 15:13.940]  You don't like all the Hawaiian shirts we got going on on this front box?
[15:14.200 --> 15:16.520]  It is. It is really something, man.
[15:16.680 --> 15:17.160]  Yeah.
[15:17.900 --> 15:23.520]  Owen Wilson, Morgan Freeman, Gary Sinise, Sarah Foster.
[15:24.180 --> 15:25.040]  Hang on, not done.
[15:25.500 --> 15:27.920]  Willie Nelson, Vinnie Jones.
[15:28.840 --> 15:29.900]  Oh, Vinnie Jones!
[15:30.180 --> 15:31.720]  Oh, we gotta see it now!
[15:32.120 --> 15:36.240]  I feel like this was Willie Nelson's film era between The Big Bounce and The Dukes of Hazard.
[15:36.240 --> 15:40.420]  I think he really... 2004 was the year he took a swing at it.
[15:40.700 --> 15:43.600]  Total runtime, 88 minutes.
[15:43.620 --> 15:44.440]  I want to watch it!
[15:44.440 --> 15:44.940]  Oh, that's a bad movie.
[15:45.160 --> 15:47.280]  Oh, that is a bad sign!
[15:47.780 --> 15:49.720]  88 minutes? That's my kind of movie.
[15:50.020 --> 15:52.820]  Yeah, I mean, that's cool that you know it's a bad movie, though.
[15:53.100 --> 15:53.200]  Wow.
[15:53.780 --> 15:53.860]  Yeah.
[15:54.640 --> 15:57.920]  85 minutes is the perfect movie length. It's so close.
[15:58.580 --> 16:00.440]  I wonder what percentage of our audience has seen this.
[16:01.120 --> 16:02.020]  Less than 1%?
[16:02.260 --> 16:03.480]  Let us know in the comments.
[16:03.680 --> 16:05.820]  We'll do a poll or something, but let us know in the comments.
[16:05.820 --> 16:08.280]  Budget, 50 million. Box office, 6.8.
[16:08.520 --> 16:08.820]  Ouch!
[16:09.260 --> 16:11.520]  Oh my god, there's huge names in that!
[16:11.900 --> 16:12.380]  That, yeah.
[16:12.480 --> 16:13.800]  It's an Elmer Leonard adaption.
[16:14.080 --> 16:17.620]  I don't know if I've ever even seen, like, a trailer for this.
[16:17.720 --> 16:19.600]  Nothing about this is familiar to me.
[16:20.280 --> 16:23.200]  Vinnie Jones probably made more money that week playing football.
[16:26.740 --> 16:30.180]  You'd think the number one review is The Big Snooze is the title of it.
[16:33.340 --> 16:34.240]  It's just, yeah.
[16:35.440 --> 16:38.060]  I'm on the hunt again, essentially, is the moral of the story.
[16:38.260 --> 16:40.060]  I think it's hilarious that somebody stole this.
[16:40.600 --> 16:42.280]  And I would have loved to have seen the reaction.
[16:42.380 --> 16:45.860]  Now I'm back looking to find the last place trophy.
[16:46.520 --> 16:49.520]  I got a few other things lined up for it that I'll reveal when we get closer.
[16:51.240 --> 16:55.660]  But last place, if anyone finds anything really dumb that is movie memorabilia,
[16:55.700 --> 16:57.160]  I guess put it in the comments.
[16:57.280 --> 16:57.620]  Let me know.
[16:58.200 --> 16:59.060]  I'd love to see it.
[16:59.780 --> 17:01.120]  Not a lot of trivia for this film either.
[17:02.060 --> 17:05.740]  Jeremy Renner was offered a role in this film, but turned it down due to SWAT,
[17:06.300 --> 17:09.440]  which is the only other Jeremy Renner movie I could think of from that time.
[17:09.460 --> 17:11.920]  Stop giving me facts about The Big Bounce.
[17:12.140 --> 17:14.280]  There's not a lot of facts to give about The Big Bounce.
[17:14.480 --> 17:17.020]  I don't know what The Big Bounce is.
[17:17.240 --> 17:17.980]  You're telling me-
[17:17.980 --> 17:21.200]  The original novel, Eric, is set in Winswet, Michigan.
[17:21.760 --> 17:28.760]  For this abeditation, George Armitage shifted the location to the more amenable Hawaii.
[17:28.880 --> 17:31.040]  Why are we still talking about this?
[17:31.580 --> 17:32.060]  What?
[17:32.280 --> 17:35.260]  I don't want to talk about The Big Bounce anymore.
[17:35.580 --> 17:36.620]  I hate The Big Bounce.
[17:36.960 --> 17:37.780]  Do you have a steak in it?
[17:39.160 --> 17:41.340]  Do you have a S-T-E-A-K in it?
[17:41.680 --> 17:41.980]  Yeah.
[17:42.520 --> 17:44.620]  Geoff, do one of your new content ideas involve bouncing?
[17:45.300 --> 17:46.120]  It could.
[17:46.480 --> 17:48.180]  I stumbled on some.
[17:48.220 --> 17:54.420]  I was in the lab a little bit this weekend, and I think I backed my way into inventing
[17:54.420 --> 17:59.600]  an entire new workout genre that I am very excited to share with y'all.
[17:59.600 --> 18:04.240]  I was at Costco, as I am once a week, every week of my life.
[18:04.320 --> 18:06.480]  It is one of my favorite places.
[18:06.640 --> 18:08.340]  But I don't like that other people go to Costco.
[18:08.600 --> 18:10.060]  I don't like other people in general.
[18:10.580 --> 18:13.440]  Other people at Costco are extra bad for some reason.
[18:13.660 --> 18:16.860]  It's like the combination of the two, it just makes like...
[18:16.860 --> 18:19.500]  It's like chocolate and peanut butter into dickheads, right?
[18:20.040 --> 18:25.180]  So while I was leaving Costco with a giant shopping cart full of shit,
[18:25.780 --> 18:28.740]  and there was a line of cars behind me.
[18:28.740 --> 18:31.360]  I don't know if you've been to the Costco's in Austin.
[18:31.680 --> 18:32.500]  I'm sure it's the same everywhere.
[18:32.640 --> 18:35.960]  But a parking place, I would pay for one at the Costco in Austin.
[18:36.400 --> 18:40.640]  I have to park like three stores over sometimes to go to the Costco that we go to,
[18:40.700 --> 18:42.720]  because it's so fucking crowded all the time.
[18:43.340 --> 18:45.780]  And while I was walking out, I was pushing my cart.
[18:45.860 --> 18:46.400]  It was pretty heavy.
[18:46.440 --> 18:47.680]  I was thinking, this is kind of a workout.
[18:47.800 --> 18:50.060]  And I was thinking about how much I fucking hate working out,
[18:50.100 --> 18:52.360]  and I have to trick myself into working out.
[18:52.580 --> 18:55.940]  Riding bikes is how I trick myself into working out these days, right?
[18:55.940 --> 18:58.860]  But that doesn't give me any kind of like upper body strength.
[18:58.880 --> 19:01.980]  And I was like, it's almost like a workout pushing this cart if I pushed it long enough.
[19:02.100 --> 19:06.900]  And then I thought, this asshole behind me is just waiting for me to get to my car
[19:07.340 --> 19:09.820]  so that I can load it up and back out and leave.
[19:09.900 --> 19:11.340]  And then he can take my parking space.
[19:11.640 --> 19:14.420]  If I just keep walking, how long is this guy going to follow me?
[19:14.700 --> 19:16.620]  I invented dickhead calisthenics.
[19:16.820 --> 19:17.620]  Here's what we do.
[19:17.700 --> 19:20.480]  We go to Costco and Walmart parking lots on Saturdays,
[19:20.480 --> 19:21.660]  or the mall where it's very crowded.
[19:21.880 --> 19:22.980]  We take a shopping cart.
[19:23.060 --> 19:25.920]  We fill it up with heavy, non-perishable items.
[19:25.920 --> 19:27.420]  Even bring weights from home if you want to.
[19:27.740 --> 19:31.500]  And then you just push a shopping cart up and down rows for 20 minutes straight,
[19:31.860 --> 19:34.700]  while people queue up behind you thinking that you're going to a parking space.
[19:34.760 --> 19:35.200]  But you're not.
[19:35.420 --> 19:36.280]  You're just getting a workout.
[19:36.600 --> 19:39.080]  You're making them miserable, getting in shape,
[19:39.180 --> 19:41.860]  and making yourself happy all at the same time.
[19:42.120 --> 19:45.140]  This is how I can trick myself into working out.
[19:45.200 --> 19:47.660]  And I bet there's a lot of other dickheads out there in the world
[19:47.660 --> 19:50.760]  that would work out if they thought it was inconveniencing someone else.
[19:51.540 --> 19:54.740]  Wait, so somebody is following you looking for a space?
[19:54.740 --> 19:56.720]  Yeah, like when you're walking through the parking lot,
[19:56.760 --> 19:58.520]  and you're pushing your cart, and there's a car behind you,
[19:58.600 --> 19:59.920]  and they think that you're going to go and unload.
[20:00.020 --> 20:02.660]  So they follow behind you so that when you unload your car and back out,
[20:02.700 --> 20:04.300]  they can swoop in and take the space.
[20:04.620 --> 20:05.860]  But you just never do that.
[20:05.940 --> 20:07.340]  You just keep going up and down the rows.
[20:07.560 --> 20:10.040]  And they're like, oh, this guy must not know where his car is.
[20:10.100 --> 20:11.440]  He must have got lost. Sucks to be him.
[20:11.560 --> 20:12.640]  But they're still following you.
[20:12.820 --> 20:13.480]  They're still following you.
[20:13.520 --> 20:15.260]  You're going to waste five or six minutes of their time
[20:15.260 --> 20:17.820]  before they realize you're never going to find your car.
[20:18.000 --> 20:20.120]  And then the next car will come up immediately and be like,
[20:20.140 --> 20:21.180]  oh, I just saw a guy.
[20:21.480 --> 20:24.060]  He's at the end of the parking lot with a full shopping cart.
[20:24.060 --> 20:25.360]  I'm about to get his space.
[20:25.540 --> 20:26.280]  But you're not.
[20:26.500 --> 20:28.600]  Because I'm going all the way back to the front of the parking lot.
[20:28.740 --> 20:30.880]  And I'm going all the way back to the end of the parking lot again.
[20:31.060 --> 20:33.460]  And after, I don't know, enough reps, I will have gotten a workout.
[20:35.240 --> 20:38.580]  My misery index will be through the roof because I've made you people unhappy.
[20:38.740 --> 20:43.480]  And I can go home sated that I've worked out my mind, my soul, and my body.
[20:43.720 --> 20:44.820]  Now, I love this idea.
[20:44.960 --> 20:45.940]  I think this is fantastic.
[20:46.340 --> 20:49.620]  My only thing, and I would love to know if it's just a...
[20:50.580 --> 20:52.020]  It could be a Canadian thing.
[20:52.020 --> 20:54.840]  It could be a community I live in thing for size.
[20:55.220 --> 21:00.300]  This has never been a thing that has occurred or has been a thing that I've even considered doing.
[21:00.480 --> 21:03.840]  This happens every parking lot in America every day.
[21:04.240 --> 21:08.880]  Like you when you can't find a space, you just keep going until you find one.
[21:09.340 --> 21:09.420]  Yeah.
[21:09.420 --> 21:12.260]  And you'll see a car backing out and you'll be like, oh, great.
[21:12.320 --> 21:13.600]  This will be my space.
[21:13.800 --> 21:17.480]  And then sometimes there may be conflict if someone tries to steal that if another vehicle
[21:17.480 --> 21:17.920]  shows up.
[21:18.360 --> 21:23.480]  But just following someone on foot seems like such a unnecessary move.
[21:23.580 --> 21:26.760]  Because like, why are you being married to this one person?
[21:26.860 --> 21:27.860]  You're in a store.
[21:28.020 --> 21:30.540]  Because this person is a guaranteed parking spot.
[21:30.620 --> 21:32.220]  They're driving towards their car.
[21:32.280 --> 21:33.520]  They're walking towards their car.
[21:33.900 --> 21:35.360]  They've already completed their groceries.
[21:35.520 --> 21:36.380]  Their shopping cart is full.
[21:36.480 --> 21:40.220]  You know, if you stay behind this person and they're on an aisle, you know, they're headed
[21:40.220 --> 21:42.160]  to the somewhere on that aisle.
[21:42.580 --> 21:44.520]  I'm surprised you've never seen this.
[21:44.560 --> 21:46.200]  This happens to me every day of my life.
[21:46.200 --> 21:48.500]  It's like explaining clouds.
[21:49.000 --> 21:50.480]  Yeah, that's I think is interesting.
[21:50.720 --> 21:52.280]  I don't know.
[21:52.340 --> 21:54.820]  As I said, it'd be interesting to know if it's cultural.
[21:55.080 --> 21:55.160]  Am I crazy?
[21:55.260 --> 21:56.760]  I'd like to hear from the other three.
[21:56.940 --> 21:59.340]  Are you guys understanding what I'm saying?
[21:59.460 --> 22:04.220]  Or do you align with Andrew's never having seen somebody follow a person in a parking
[22:04.220 --> 22:04.920]  lot for a space?
[22:05.300 --> 22:07.580]  And just to be clear, I completely get where you're coming from.
[22:07.620 --> 22:10.560]  It's just not something that I have seen or would consider as a driver.
[22:10.860 --> 22:12.520]  Yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about, Jeff.
[22:12.660 --> 22:13.060]  Exactly.
[22:13.380 --> 22:13.580]  Yeah.
[22:14.100 --> 22:19.160]  I think it could be a size of my community thing because the Costco is annoying to get
[22:19.160 --> 22:19.980]  a space at.
[22:20.140 --> 22:23.880]  But if you just keep driving, you will find one within five minutes in that parking lot.
[22:24.120 --> 22:25.900]  But Gavin, do you understand this also?
[22:26.560 --> 22:26.760]  Yeah.
[22:27.200 --> 22:28.340]  OK, because you don't drive.
[22:28.400 --> 22:29.180]  So I was just curious.
[22:29.700 --> 22:30.320]  I've been a passenger.
[22:30.480 --> 22:31.300]  I've been in a car.
[22:33.920 --> 22:38.280]  I just feel like most places I go, though, you just park at the back, just like go just
[22:38.280 --> 22:39.140]  drive far away.
[22:39.260 --> 22:39.780]  That's what I do.
[22:40.020 --> 22:41.280]  Go to Costco and park at the back.
[22:41.340 --> 22:41.940]  There is no back.
[22:41.980 --> 22:42.420]  It's full.
[22:42.420 --> 22:43.960]  Yeah, I've only been once.
[22:44.100 --> 22:44.540]  Yeah.
[22:44.780 --> 22:45.120]  What?
[22:45.780 --> 22:47.160]  You've only been to Costco once?
[22:47.520 --> 22:47.700]  Yeah.
[22:48.320 --> 22:48.940]  What, really?
[22:49.080 --> 22:49.800]  That's enough for him.
[22:49.880 --> 22:50.740]  I mean, he doesn't drive.
[22:50.880 --> 22:51.600]  Want to go get lunch?
[22:52.140 --> 22:54.940]  You want to go get lunch?
[22:55.300 --> 22:55.740]  Yes.
[22:56.080 --> 22:57.900]  The staycat will be on the move because they couldn't park.
[22:58.040 --> 23:00.080]  Gavin and Nick should have to go get lunch at a Costco.
[23:00.360 --> 23:03.520]  Because here's like what Gavin's saying is right.
[23:03.740 --> 23:06.720]  Yeah, just go park in the back away from everything, whatever.
[23:07.480 --> 23:09.860]  But that doesn't stop everyone else.
[23:09.860 --> 23:13.660]  And I think those are the comments that we'll get on something like this, where it's like,
[23:13.700 --> 23:14.520]  well, I just park in the back.
[23:14.580 --> 23:16.220]  It's like, right, then this doesn't apply to you.
[23:16.680 --> 23:21.220]  This applies to every other person trying to park in the front, like the closest parking spot.
[23:21.380 --> 23:23.780]  But there are no spots in the back at Costco.
[23:23.900 --> 23:25.900]  I'm telling you, I was there Sunday.
[23:26.160 --> 23:28.980]  We drove around for 12 minutes.
[23:29.760 --> 23:32.800]  Like I had to park at a Marshalls.
[23:33.200 --> 23:37.700]  It was Costco, Whole Foods, Marshalls.
[23:37.700 --> 23:43.820]  Had to park at the Marshalls and walk through the Marshalls and the Whole Foods and into the
[23:43.820 --> 23:45.400]  Costco parking lot to get a space.
[23:45.460 --> 23:47.300]  I would have happily parked in the back.
[23:47.380 --> 23:47.900]  I would have happily.
[23:48.140 --> 23:52.960]  Dude, at the Costco where I go to, people park on the fucking grass next to trees to go there.
[23:53.040 --> 23:55.500]  There are these spaces you're talking about don't exist.
[23:55.860 --> 23:56.500]  That's so interesting.
[23:56.600 --> 24:02.100]  I have been to like Best Buy car parks before, though, with Americans, and they'll just do
[24:02.640 --> 24:06.280]  four or five loops of the front trying to get a real close spot.
[24:06.280 --> 24:11.460]  Just be driving past 150 empty spots just slightly further away.
[24:11.480 --> 24:13.420]  Just just throw the car somewhere.
[24:13.840 --> 24:14.720]  I'm right there with you, dude.
[24:14.780 --> 24:16.020]  Get a little bit of exercise.
[24:16.120 --> 24:16.560]  Go walk.
[24:16.660 --> 24:17.340]  I like to walk.
[24:17.520 --> 24:21.760]  That's why I want to invent this game where the job, the whole point of the job is to walk
[24:21.760 --> 24:23.620]  up and down the aisles.
[24:23.700 --> 24:23.840]  Yeah.
[24:23.900 --> 24:28.180]  I think a lot of Americans on the daily will park as though it's raining, even when it's not.
[24:29.240 --> 24:30.840]  Additionally, this is just the first.
[24:31.040 --> 24:33.140]  This is just the first exercise I've come up with.
[24:33.140 --> 24:36.380]  I think that this is a this is kind of a thought starter.
[24:36.560 --> 24:37.680]  This is kind of a hey, do it.
[24:37.720 --> 24:38.360]  Try it on for size.
[24:38.440 --> 24:39.000]  See who it is.
[24:39.280 --> 24:39.680]  Oh, cool.
[24:39.720 --> 24:40.300]  I got a workout.
[24:40.460 --> 24:41.800]  I got to be a little bit of a dickhead.
[24:41.860 --> 24:43.200]  It served both purposes.
[24:43.600 --> 24:49.360]  How else can I apply this ideology to working out and find other ways that you can be a dickhead
[24:49.360 --> 24:51.540]  to other people while getting a workout yourself?
[24:51.600 --> 24:52.280]  I'd love to hear it.
[24:53.500 --> 24:59.200]  In a multi-story building, you watch someone go into a lift and then you run up the stairs
[24:59.200 --> 25:01.700]  and you hit the button on every floor from the outside.
[25:01.700 --> 25:02.540]  Wow.
[25:03.080 --> 25:06.420]  Until you're at the top and you really get your cardio in and you're pissed off.
[25:06.440 --> 25:07.500]  I love that.
[25:08.140 --> 25:09.380]  Oh, wow, Gavin.
[25:09.580 --> 25:10.580]  That is great.
[25:10.760 --> 25:12.940]  That's that's exactly what we're talking about.
[25:13.040 --> 25:15.120]  That is dickhead calisthenics to a tee, Gavin.
[25:15.160 --> 25:16.120]  That is brilliant.
[25:16.640 --> 25:17.620]  Now let's block two.
[25:18.580 --> 25:22.920]  Hit pause on whatever you're listening to and hit play on your next adventure.
[25:23.600 --> 25:26.100]  Stay two nights and get a $50 Best Western gift card.
[25:26.700 --> 25:27.240]  Life's a trip.

[25:38.080 --> 25:42.220]  Google built in and advanced safety features for all your precious cargo.
[25:42.320 --> 25:45.440]  The new Volvo XC90 designed for life.

[25:48.080 --> 25:52.800]  When you go back home, Gavin, is there an adjustment for how to deal with
[25:53.400 --> 25:55.260]  drivers as a pedestrian for you?
[25:55.820 --> 26:03.220]  Like is the culture around navigating on foot in a vehicle or in an area with vehicles different?
[26:03.800 --> 26:06.060]  Because I find that jarring whenever I was in Austin.
[26:06.520 --> 26:07.500]  How is it jarring for you?
[26:08.020 --> 26:10.920]  Like nobody, nobody waits for you to cross.
[26:11.160 --> 26:14.220]  You have to declare that as the walker.
[26:14.400 --> 26:16.500]  Are you talking about just on a crossing or just anywhere?
[26:16.980 --> 26:19.120]  Just on a crossing generally, I'd say.
[26:19.760 --> 26:26.280]  Here, it is a thing where if you're standing to cross, a car will stop almost immediately.
[26:26.600 --> 26:29.500]  Where in Austin, it felt like I had to declare that I was crossing.
[26:30.000 --> 26:31.860]  Well, the light usually tells you.
[26:32.360 --> 26:34.600]  In an environment without a light, I guess. Jesus Christ.
[26:35.360 --> 26:39.960]  OK, well, yeah, in England, there's the zebra crossings, which they have to stop.
[26:40.460 --> 26:43.600]  OK, so there's certain crossings where you could just walk across
[26:44.160 --> 26:46.160]  immediately, but depends on where you are.
[26:46.160 --> 26:50.180]  I was just trying to like equate to Jeff's Costco thing of like, once again,
[26:50.240 --> 26:56.760]  I don't know if it is a different culture or if it is just a I live in a smaller population area.
[26:56.820 --> 26:58.040]  So it's just different.
[26:58.300 --> 27:01.340]  I think you live in a small town that doesn't have a lot of traffic, probably.
[27:01.560 --> 27:03.980]  But Austin is the 11th largest city in America.
[27:04.320 --> 27:06.900]  Yeah, it would definitely be different.
[27:06.980 --> 27:08.900]  But it's also I mean, there's layers of culture.
[27:09.560 --> 27:11.300]  Costco, just a general nightmare.
[27:11.860 --> 27:16.840]  I wonder what the worst Costco is like as far as what country's Costco is the most annoying.
[27:18.080 --> 27:19.620]  Is there a global brand?
[27:19.700 --> 27:20.420]  I would assume, right?
[27:20.460 --> 27:22.600]  There's Costco's everywhere around the world.
[27:22.740 --> 27:24.880]  There are there. I know they're in Japan, at least.
[27:25.200 --> 27:26.780]  I bet you Costco Japan is great.
[27:27.240 --> 27:30.200]  Yeah, I've heard I've heard Costco Japan's pretty cool.
[27:30.300 --> 27:33.980]  And if you have like your Costco membership from the US, it gets you in there also.
[27:34.160 --> 27:37.060]  Yeah. And they have like fresh sushi that they make in house and stuff.
[27:37.120 --> 27:37.760]  That's supposed to be really good.
[27:37.760 --> 27:44.320]  Uh, Austin is the 11th largest city, according to this list.
[27:44.940 --> 27:46.380]  12th is Jacksonville.
[27:46.760 --> 27:50.500]  Yeah, it's like it's like metropolitan area or however they measure cities.
[27:50.700 --> 27:53.720]  I just wouldn't I would if you would have asked me, where does Jacksonville rank?
[27:53.780 --> 27:54.700]  I would have been like 55.
[27:55.140 --> 27:56.640]  Like, yeah, that's crazy.
[27:56.860 --> 27:59.500]  I lived in Jacksonville for three and a half years and I wouldn't rank it in the top 50.
[27:59.940 --> 28:00.340]  Wild.
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.560]  There should be an Olympic of Costco guys.
[28:04.820 --> 28:09.980]  Every country's Costco guys going head to head because we only have the U.S.
[28:10.000 --> 28:10.860]  Costco guys currently.
[28:11.220 --> 28:14.960]  I want to see what Japan's Costco guys look like.
[28:15.040 --> 28:16.180]  What's Costco guys?
[28:16.560 --> 28:18.420]  He's talking about the Rizzler and all those dudes.
[28:18.940 --> 28:19.200]  Yeah.
[28:22.400 --> 28:24.540]  Why does Eric sound like he's in a small bag?
[28:24.680 --> 28:25.720]  He said so far away, Eric.
[28:25.840 --> 28:28.080]  But I love it because I know how much you love the Rizzler.
[28:28.240 --> 28:30.900]  It's like you got so excited your whole equipment broke when you tried to unmute.
[28:31.600 --> 28:32.720]  Guys, guys, guys.
[28:32.720 --> 28:35.160]  Sorry, I got I started just slamming shit around.
[28:35.240 --> 28:36.860]  I heard I heard we were talking about the Rizzler.
[28:37.100 --> 28:40.940]  I think the Rizzler is going to have the longest career of those crew by far.
[28:41.180 --> 28:42.120]  I'm a big Rizzler guy.
[28:42.560 --> 28:43.560]  Well, he's got the Rizz.
[28:44.000 --> 28:51.780]  He's got the Rizz and his gimmick is just him being him where I feel like the Costco guys
[28:51.780 --> 28:54.400]  are reliant on the boom and the doom.
[28:54.660 --> 29:00.900]  Yeah, it's much like how Tobuscus had epic win, fail, boom or doom will eventually run
[29:00.900 --> 29:01.740]  its course, I imagine.
[29:02.720 --> 29:03.920]  Yeah, but not the Rizzler.
[29:04.420 --> 29:05.000]  Rizzler is forever.
[29:06.680 --> 29:13.000]  Speaking of forever, a long time ago, you and I got you and I, you guys and I.
[29:13.160 --> 29:13.300]  What?
[29:13.440 --> 29:15.700]  A long time ago, we landed on an idea.
[29:16.080 --> 29:17.620]  This is during Face Days.
[29:17.980 --> 29:18.180]  OK.
[29:18.480 --> 29:25.000]  We landed on an idea that our company, our brand should be protected by a superhero or
[29:25.000 --> 29:25.440]  a mascot.
[29:25.640 --> 29:25.780]  Yes.
[29:26.600 --> 29:28.920]  We began a global search.
[29:28.920 --> 29:34.920]  We eventually landed on the Smashing Sportsman, who I think was a perfect choice, was a journalist
[29:34.920 --> 29:37.740]  who developed arthritis and got angry about it, right?
[29:38.280 --> 29:38.420]  Yep.
[29:41.040 --> 29:42.000]  We attempted.
[29:42.520 --> 29:47.840]  Boy, were we surprised and happy to find out that the Smashing Sportsman was a property
[29:47.840 --> 29:48.720]  of Warner Brothers.
[29:49.280 --> 29:51.720]  And so we immediately thought, this is great.
[29:51.760 --> 29:55.660]  Maybe we can acquire the licensing from the Smashing Sportsman, who's not being used.
[29:55.820 --> 29:57.960]  Or do like a collaboration of some kind.
[29:57.960 --> 29:59.020]  Or do a collaboration.
[29:59.780 --> 30:01.520]  Our efforts fell on deaf ears.
[30:01.820 --> 30:02.940]  I don't think we were...
[30:02.940 --> 30:03.100]  Shockingly.
[30:03.400 --> 30:05.380]  Yeah, I don't think we were high on the priority list.
[30:05.540 --> 30:08.780]  I don't begrudge Warner Brothers for that at all.
[30:08.780 --> 30:09.640]  No, that's fair.
[30:09.860 --> 30:14.240]  But I would consider that to have been a dead end, the Smashing Sportsman, right?
[30:14.320 --> 30:15.040]  I absolutely agree.
[30:15.620 --> 30:19.520]  We are now fans of the Smashing Sportsman and maybe the only people alive who are familiar
[30:19.520 --> 30:19.860]  with him.
[30:20.660 --> 30:24.780]  I was doing a podcast for So Alright yesterday.
[30:25.480 --> 30:28.260]  And I was talking about Woodsy the Owl.
[30:28.520 --> 30:32.080]  I was just at Disneyland and they had a Woodsy the Owl and a Smokey the Bear t-shirt.
[30:32.180 --> 30:33.240]  So I thought that that was weird at Disney.
[30:33.340 --> 30:38.060]  And I bought one because it's all about just how I like Woodsy the Owl and how it endeared
[30:38.060 --> 30:39.000]  itself to me as a child.
[30:39.080 --> 30:44.280]  But when I was learning about Woodsy the Owl, it mentioned that he and Smokey, along
[30:44.280 --> 30:52.760]  with Johnny Horizon, were the Department of Agriculture's forestry department mascots
[30:53.400 --> 30:54.120]  back in the day.
[30:54.180 --> 30:55.040]  And I thought, Johnny Horizon?
[30:55.160 --> 30:57.480]  I've never heard of Johnny Horizon.
[30:57.740 --> 30:59.320]  Let me look that name up.
[30:59.780 --> 31:00.900]  Here's Johnny Horizon.
[31:01.640 --> 31:05.480]  Johnny Horizon was a mascot used by the Bureau of Land Management in the United States in
[31:05.480 --> 31:08.440]  the 1970s, primarily for its anti-litter campaign.
[31:08.920 --> 31:10.080]  Yeah, this land is your land.
[31:10.080 --> 31:15.940]  When they had the bicentennial, they had a huge program led by Johnny Horizon, which
[31:15.940 --> 31:20.240]  was like, let's get 200 million Americans to clean up America for our 200th year, our
[31:20.240 --> 31:20.700]  bicentennial.
[31:20.800 --> 31:21.260]  Here it is right now.
[31:21.380 --> 31:22.900]  It was a huge success.
[31:23.040 --> 31:23.820]  It was so successful.
[31:23.960 --> 31:31.240]  They were in the process of creating Johnny Horizon National Park grounds around the country
[31:31.240 --> 31:32.620]  that you could go and stay at.
[31:32.680 --> 31:34.060]  It was like KOA campgrounds.
[31:34.280 --> 31:38.440]  Johnny Horizon was instantly bigger than Woodsy Owl and Smokey the Bear.
[31:38.920 --> 31:42.320]  However, he became very expensive very quickly.
[31:42.520 --> 31:46.600]  And the people that created Johnny Horizon after like two years after the successful
[31:46.600 --> 31:50.720]  campaign in 74 and 75 for the bicentennial, they went to the Department of Agriculture
[31:50.720 --> 31:52.620]  and said, we need to double the budget on Johnny Horizon.
[31:52.880 --> 31:53.620]  We want more of this.
[31:53.940 --> 31:55.740]  The Department of Agriculture said, fuck you.
[31:56.160 --> 31:57.260]  We don't need this.
[31:57.400 --> 31:59.260]  We've got a bear and an owl.
[31:59.440 --> 31:59.880]  We don't need it.
[31:59.960 --> 32:02.260]  We don't need the Marlboro Man without a cigarette.
[32:02.720 --> 32:03.800]  We've got our own shit.
[32:03.800 --> 32:12.720]  So in 1982, they relinquished their trademark on Johnny Horizon.
[32:13.360 --> 32:15.280]  I think he's an independent player.
[32:15.760 --> 32:16.160]  Really?
[32:16.740 --> 32:22.140]  He was huge in the mid-70s, led a nationwide anti-littering campaign.
[32:22.580 --> 32:27.300]  His only problem was he teamed up with Burl Ives when Burl Ives was like a big deal.
[32:27.400 --> 32:30.060]  Like his only problem was that he cost too much money to produce.
[32:30.060 --> 32:35.960]  And so they cut and ran and they relinquished their ownership of him.
[32:36.320 --> 32:38.920]  He isn't trademarked or owned by anybody.
[32:39.360 --> 32:41.480]  Are you thinking grab him for the tricentennial?
[32:41.960 --> 32:44.190]  I think Johnny Horizon could be...
[32:44.620 --> 32:46.580]  He seems like a regulation kind of guy.
[32:46.800 --> 32:48.100]  He wears a cowboy hat.
[32:48.320 --> 32:49.980]  He's got an awesome fucking name.
[32:50.180 --> 32:51.520]  He's royalty free.
[32:52.380 --> 32:54.500]  And he's already done a lot of good for the world.
[32:54.720 --> 32:56.480]  I think Johnny Horizon's awesome.
[32:56.780 --> 32:58.340]  I back him fully.
[32:58.340 --> 33:01.280]  I do want to say that this also helps me back him.
[33:01.540 --> 33:02.800]  He's friends with Snoopy.
[33:03.180 --> 33:05.800]  There you go.
[33:05.980 --> 33:09.200]  This was part of a pledge that I started looking it up.
[33:09.340 --> 33:15.120]  Part of a pledge that they did with Johnny Horizon was Snoopy pounce on pollution.
[33:16.060 --> 33:17.900]  And it's not just Snoopy.
[33:18.440 --> 33:21.780]  It's Snoopy talking about join the Johnny Horizon team.
[33:21.900 --> 33:23.040]  It's a winner.
[33:23.700 --> 33:25.440]  And it's Snoopy full on.
[33:25.480 --> 33:26.660]  Dude, this rocks.
[33:26.660 --> 33:30.560]  He could even start a band and call it bring me Johnny Horizon.
[33:32.100 --> 33:34.540]  Oh, man, we suck.
[33:34.880 --> 33:35.420]  That sucks.
[33:35.860 --> 33:37.540]  We'll have to like...
[33:37.540 --> 33:39.260]  Here's Johnny Horizon and Burl Ives.
[33:40.280 --> 33:43.320]  We'll have to do some research and look into it further.
[33:43.580 --> 33:49.360]  But guys, I think we might have stumbled on a mascot and protector who already protects
[33:49.360 --> 33:49.980]  the environment.
[33:50.380 --> 33:52.700]  Why can't he protect our regulation environment?
[33:52.840 --> 33:56.080]  And since he's so fucking popular or he was so popular.
[33:56.080 --> 33:57.480]  Why don't we bring him back to prominence?
[33:57.540 --> 34:00.520]  Why don't we become the face of anti-littering campaigns in 2025?
[34:00.960 --> 34:01.460]  You know what I'm saying?
[34:01.920 --> 34:02.720]  Why don't we get involved?
[34:03.140 --> 34:05.540]  We're getting on to the 250th year, right?
[34:05.920 --> 34:07.640]  For it was the bicentennial.
[34:07.760 --> 34:09.240]  What's a 250 year anniversary?
[34:09.440 --> 34:11.440]  Because that's next year, isn't it?
[34:11.700 --> 34:13.100]  It's a very good point.
[34:13.580 --> 34:13.940]  Yeah.
[34:13.940 --> 34:14.520]  What do they call that?
[34:14.900 --> 34:15.420]  I don't know.
[34:15.540 --> 34:16.500]  What's a millennium?
[34:20.420 --> 34:21.940]  Whoa, that's a cool.
[34:22.580 --> 34:22.980]  Wow.
[34:29.540 --> 34:31.500]  Semi-quincentennial.
[34:32.230 --> 34:32.720]  What?
[34:33.180 --> 34:35.140]  Semi-quincentennial.
[34:35.560 --> 34:46.260]  Or a sestercentennial or a quarter millennial or another thing also written here.
[34:46.600 --> 34:47.960]  The big 250.
[34:47.960 --> 34:53.540]  Oh, guys, there's one more piece to this.
[34:53.600 --> 34:54.660]  I just thought I would go out there.
[34:54.880 --> 34:55.080]  Okay.
[34:55.180 --> 34:58.820]  In Twin Falls, Idaho, far from the prying eyes of Washington.
[34:58.820 --> 34:59.420]  I'm reading this.
[34:59.640 --> 35:05.200]  Every April, the town folk gather to honor the memory of their hero on Johnny Horizon Day.
[35:05.540 --> 35:07.700]  They do what he first asked of them in 1965.
[35:08.000 --> 35:09.760]  They clean up the land because it's their land.
[35:09.860 --> 35:15.700]  Every April in Twin Falls, Idaho, they have a Johnny Horizon cleanup Idaho day where everybody
[35:15.700 --> 35:18.200]  gets together and celebrate Johnny Horizon and they clean up litter.
[35:18.340 --> 35:19.300]  I think we should go to that.
[35:19.720 --> 35:20.940]  I don't think we can go this year, obviously.
[35:21.360 --> 35:27.720]  But I think that should be in our must-visit places around the world, like Deputy,
[35:28.560 --> 35:32.020]  Indiana, the Bean Holes Days, this thing.
[35:32.780 --> 35:35.560]  Now, I'm looking at it.
[35:36.360 --> 35:41.800]  The last proclamation of Johnny Horizon Day was Saturday, May 4th, 2024.
[35:42.340 --> 35:49.000]  And currently, there is no scheduled proclaimed Johnny Horizon Day in...
[35:50.200 --> 35:51.000]  Oh, no.
[35:51.320 --> 35:53.280]  Yeah, in Twin Falls County, Idaho.
[35:53.540 --> 35:55.820]  Then we might be stepping in at the exact right time.
[35:55.920 --> 35:57.620]  Yeah, we need to keep this going.
[35:57.980 --> 35:59.240]  We gotta keep this going.
[35:59.560 --> 36:02.340]  I think Johnny Horizon and Ratty Boy would be real close.
[36:02.540 --> 36:03.000]  I like this.
[36:03.000 --> 36:04.840]  I don't agree with that at all.
[36:04.840 --> 36:07.500]  I think Johnny Horizon would punt Ratty Boy into a lake.
[36:09.040 --> 36:09.580]  You know what?
[36:09.640 --> 36:10.540]  Ratty Boy would like that.
[36:10.540 --> 36:14.940]  Andrew, are you feeling threatened that possibly Johnny Horizon could outshine Johnny Caviar?
[36:15.420 --> 36:16.880]  No, not at all.
[36:17.080 --> 36:18.580]  They are first name related, though.
[36:18.900 --> 36:19.360]  They are.
[36:19.580 --> 36:20.140]  Yeah.
[36:20.940 --> 36:25.200]  Caviar has a level of slime to them that nobody can compare.
[36:26.660 --> 36:28.660]  I'm not worried about being outprestiged.
[36:28.780 --> 36:30.180]  It's not very hard to do.
[36:30.260 --> 36:32.060]  That's not really Caviar's thing.
[36:32.680 --> 36:37.400]  Is there anything more regulation than a guy without a cigarette and a cowboy hat?
[36:37.460 --> 36:39.900]  The Marlboro Man who's not smoking his lungs out?
[36:40.540 --> 36:41.080]  Pretty cool.
[36:41.500 --> 36:42.600]  Yeah, I like it.
[36:42.640 --> 36:43.840]  Johnny Horizon.
[36:44.040 --> 36:45.320]  It's an awesome name.
[36:45.680 --> 36:46.360]  It's pretty cool.
[36:46.500 --> 36:47.040]  I really like Johnny Horizon.
[36:47.140 --> 36:47.320]  Yeah.
[36:47.440 --> 36:50.560]  And again, friends with Snoopy, that's got to count for something.
[36:51.020 --> 36:51.800]  It counts for a lot.
[36:52.120 --> 36:56.500]  I think as a side to this, something I've been meaning to share.
[36:56.580 --> 36:59.080]  I feel like you will especially enjoy this.
[36:59.820 --> 37:00.140]  I went...
[37:01.440 --> 37:03.940]  Jeff, typically you follow that with a name, that phrase.
[37:04.020 --> 37:04.880]  I was just loading up a photo.
[37:06.160 --> 37:09.280]  I went deep into the history of the A&W Burger family
[37:09.280 --> 37:11.180]  because there was a thing quite a while ago
[37:11.180 --> 37:14.380]  where you guys weren't familiar with the A&W Burger family
[37:14.380 --> 37:16.840]  because I don't think it's really a thing in the U.S.
[37:17.600 --> 37:21.960]  Like all the burgers at A&W in Canada are named after like family members.
[37:22.080 --> 37:26.080]  It's like the Papa Burger or the Mama Burger or the Teen Burger.
[37:26.420 --> 37:28.380]  And I posted something and Eric said,
[37:28.460 --> 37:29.560]  What the fuck is a Teen Burger?
[37:29.800 --> 37:31.760]  And so it led me on a thing of,
[37:31.900 --> 37:36.120]  Oh, you guys just know Rudy the Root Bear as your A&W logo.
[37:36.340 --> 37:36.780]  What?
[37:37.080 --> 37:38.680]  We do what?
[37:38.680 --> 37:40.060]  What are you talking about?
[37:40.080 --> 37:41.380]  What the fuck do we know?
[37:41.680 --> 37:43.080]  You don't know about Rudy the Root Bear?
[37:43.740 --> 37:48.100]  Oh, so clearly these idiots only know about Rudy the Root Bear.
[37:48.540 --> 37:50.480]  So let me let me just start with the burger family
[37:50.480 --> 37:52.400]  because that's the central point of what I want to talk about.
[37:52.460 --> 37:54.820]  I didn't expect having to do a history lesson on Rudy the Root Bear.
[37:55.160 --> 37:57.560]  But when A&W started as a chain,
[37:57.740 --> 38:00.900]  they had a group of characters called the Burger Family.
[38:01.080 --> 38:02.260]  And that was their whole gimmick,
[38:02.380 --> 38:04.500]  was that they had burgers and it was a family
[38:04.500 --> 38:07.660]  and they all like burgers and you could order specific burgers of that type.
[38:07.660 --> 38:09.240]  And can I ask a question real fast?
[38:09.380 --> 38:09.900]  Yeah, go ahead.
[38:10.380 --> 38:12.440]  Is this an American company or a Canadian company?
[38:12.720 --> 38:15.880]  So that's a really weird one to answer because it's both.
[38:16.060 --> 38:18.400]  Like it's an existing brand, but they're owned separately.
[38:18.940 --> 38:19.120]  Yes.
[38:19.140 --> 38:22.800]  So the Canadian version of A&W is completely unique to the American version,
[38:23.080 --> 38:24.540]  although there is overlapping things.
[38:24.560 --> 38:25.120]  There is overlap.
[38:26.980 --> 38:31.880]  There is a degree of overlap, but the Burger Family still very much prevalent in Canada.
[38:32.200 --> 38:36.780]  They got rid of the Burger Family when Rudy the Root Bear came into the scene in the U.S.
[38:37.340 --> 38:43.420]  But when you made an A&W restaurant, you had to bring the family into your rest.
[38:43.460 --> 38:45.400]  Like it was part of the setting up of it.
[38:45.840 --> 38:50.860]  So all of these giant plaster family statues existed.
[38:51.300 --> 38:54.880]  But then Rudy the Root Bear became way more popular.
[38:55.160 --> 38:57.220]  And so they had to get rid of these statues
[38:57.740 --> 39:00.320]  because they were no longer representatives in the U.S.
[39:00.340 --> 39:01.220]  They were just characters.
[39:01.220 --> 39:05.320]  So there are communities that are obsessed with, like,
[39:05.500 --> 39:07.980]  trying to track down where these statues ended up.
[39:08.100 --> 39:10.460]  And there's some great resources you can find online
[39:10.460 --> 39:14.280]  of people that have just pursued and or found how they've been repurposed.
[39:14.500 --> 39:21.360]  So this is the Papa Burger, but he has been repainted and is at a car dealership.
[39:21.380 --> 39:21.940]  Oh, my God.
[39:21.940 --> 39:23.400]  He's just a car dealer guy.
[39:24.340 --> 39:31.020]  This is some Papa Burger and Teen Burger stuff that they found in a mini golf course.
[39:31.620 --> 39:32.960]  Unrelated to A&W.
[39:34.040 --> 39:39.260]  This is Papa Burger that has been repainted and had his eyes changed to look.
[39:39.780 --> 39:42.380]  But like you could clearly tell it is the same guy.
[39:43.060 --> 39:45.580]  So it is almost like you're saying in the sense of, like,
[39:45.620 --> 39:49.440]  these are characters that have been abandoned, but then adopted by other businesses
[39:49.440 --> 39:53.500]  because restaurants had to sell these giant fucking statues that they didn't have space for.
[39:53.660 --> 39:55.940]  It's like they got fired and had to find other jobs.
[39:56.420 --> 39:56.900]  Yeah.
[39:59.100 --> 40:06.240]  So as we maybe explore deeper into becoming affiliated with Johnny Horizon,
[40:06.500 --> 40:11.360]  maybe also any listeners, if you catch the burger family around in an unofficial new
[40:11.360 --> 40:13.380]  employment role, let us know.
[40:13.980 --> 40:19.840]  We should find a Papa Burger holder, man, and just snap the head off,
[40:20.260 --> 40:24.340]  face it upwards and make our regulation Ian statue outside the office.
[40:24.660 --> 40:25.820]  Oh, that would be so funny.
[40:26.360 --> 40:28.420]  Just repaint them. I really like that.
[40:29.560 --> 40:31.500]  You're talking about these mascots.
[40:31.660 --> 40:34.620]  And it reminded me of something that I learned not too long ago.
[40:35.700 --> 40:39.620]  You know, the Jack and Diane song at the beginning where he says,
[40:39.680 --> 40:42.280]  sucking on chili dogs outside the tasty freeze.
[40:42.940 --> 40:45.860]  You know, it's not about chili, like the hot dog, right?
[40:46.240 --> 40:50.820]  Oh, chili dogs are what they're slurpy slush puppies are called.
[40:51.300 --> 40:53.820]  Yeah, I mean, I've had a they're my favorite, actually,
[40:53.880 --> 40:55.640]  but I never made that connection in my life.
[40:55.820 --> 41:00.280]  Neither did I until until like a like a few weeks ago.
[41:00.460 --> 41:04.080]  Everyone thinks it's sucking on like a chili dog, like a like a hot dog.
[41:04.140 --> 41:06.300]  And it's not. It's it's a slush puppy.
[41:06.580 --> 41:07.100]  Wild.
[41:08.460 --> 41:11.080]  So just to add to how fucked up these things get.
[41:11.420 --> 41:12.200]  Here's another Papa.
[41:13.020 --> 41:14.580]  This is a Papa Burger sprout.
[41:15.420 --> 41:18.040]  What? Wait, what? Hang on.
[41:18.240 --> 41:20.480]  OK, what the fuck? Hang on.
[41:20.900 --> 41:25.700]  He's he's the he's the giant that sells
[41:25.700 --> 41:31.360]  vegetables, but he's holding a brick and he's next to jelly beans.
[41:31.620 --> 41:34.600]  I know. I don't know what business he's promoting there.
[41:34.680 --> 41:39.300]  But yeah, I just the idea of like Papa Burger, the great American family
[41:39.300 --> 41:43.220]  and just seeing all of the roads that they've had to follow since then.
[41:43.480 --> 41:44.440]  I like the one with the ice cream.
[41:44.500 --> 41:46.240]  They didn't put the ice cream on the high up hand.
[41:46.660 --> 41:49.360]  They just had it hanging out to the side.
[41:49.680 --> 41:51.820]  These are these are crazy.
[41:52.140 --> 41:54.340]  These are Canada's weird.
[41:54.340 --> 41:56.840]  Why would that be the one you hang on to A&W?
[41:57.040 --> 41:57.800]  How strange.
[41:58.140 --> 42:02.460]  I've eaten and drank a lot of A&W in my life, and I've never heard of the bear or these guys.
[42:02.560 --> 42:02.940]  That's crazy.
[42:03.040 --> 42:03.320]  Really?
[42:03.480 --> 42:06.200]  Hey, oh, dude, these idiots only know about the root bear.
[42:06.300 --> 42:08.520]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[42:08.560 --> 42:11.760]  Maybe 2025 is the year regulation gives back.
[42:11.880 --> 42:13.640]  This is the year we created the fruit demon.
[42:13.780 --> 42:16.580]  We're encouraging fruit consumption and healthy eating.
[42:16.780 --> 42:19.540]  We're going to we're anti litter now because of Johnny Horizon.
[42:19.760 --> 42:21.960]  We're a real do-gooder kind of podcast.
[42:22.760 --> 42:25.180]  This is a I want a website where this is collecting them.
[42:25.340 --> 42:26.680]  This is freaky Papa Burger.
[42:27.260 --> 42:29.520]  Gavin's going to mail his cum every what the hell?
[42:30.420 --> 42:31.860]  He's real freaky.
[42:32.720 --> 42:33.460]  Holy hell.
[42:33.700 --> 42:34.820]  He's playing like NFL.
[42:35.020 --> 42:36.820]  He's like playing like NFL Blitz.
[42:37.120 --> 42:37.780]  What is this?
[42:38.540 --> 42:40.120]  The burger looks great on that one.
[42:40.600 --> 42:46.140]  At some point, that will still exist in the world and everybody who knew what it was.
[42:46.220 --> 42:46.580]  Wow.
[42:48.320 --> 42:48.880]  Wow.
[42:49.660 --> 42:49.920]  Yeah.
[42:50.380 --> 42:51.740]  There'll be no connection to it.
[42:51.960 --> 42:53.160]  It'll just be a creepy.
[42:53.300 --> 42:55.480]  Well, who made that creepy old guy with the hot hamburger?
[42:57.180 --> 42:58.860]  Oh, Rudy, the root bears in that.
[42:58.940 --> 42:59.500]  What the fuck?
[43:00.500 --> 43:05.320]  I did something the other day that I haven't done, I think, since I was a kid where I kind
[43:05.320 --> 43:06.280]  of like popped my nut.
[43:06.620 --> 43:07.200]  You know what I mean?
[43:08.460 --> 43:10.820]  No, I definitely don't.
[43:10.940 --> 43:15.280]  You ever like as a kid, you know, kind of sit funny and you kind of you squash a testicle
[43:15.280 --> 43:18.060]  and then it just shoots out somewhere else into the scrotum.
[43:20.140 --> 43:21.300]  Yes, sure, I guess.
[43:21.300 --> 43:23.920]  Yeah, I just would never describe it as pop a nut.
[43:24.520 --> 43:29.840]  I just feel like I had stopped doing that and then it happened and it was like a painful
[43:29.840 --> 43:31.420]  memory that brought me back to childhood.
[43:32.700 --> 43:34.020]  Slip the ball, maybe.
[43:34.660 --> 43:35.560]  Is that how you would say it?
[43:35.960 --> 43:39.420]  Does it ever worry you what other painful childhood memories there are out there that
[43:39.420 --> 43:42.260]  you forgot that you're someday going to dislodge like a ball?
[43:45.400 --> 43:46.540]  That's actually really fun.
[43:46.580 --> 43:51.880]  Do you think like Evil Knievel had repressed memories and like he'd stub his toe and remember
[43:51.880 --> 43:54.920]  just being lit on fire and falling through like a mountain?
[43:55.180 --> 43:59.560]  I don't like remembering something unpleasant from a long time ago and be like, oh, I didn't
[43:59.560 --> 44:02.580]  think about that for 30 years because God knows what else I haven't thought about for
[44:02.580 --> 44:03.160]  30 years.
[44:04.140 --> 44:09.220]  Yeah, like I had one of those when we we recently did a worst songs draft and I was thinking
[44:09.220 --> 44:13.040]  like, what is just generally genuine, terrible music that I've heard?
[44:13.120 --> 44:17.700]  And it brought back a YouTube video that I hadn't seen in like 17 years and hadn't thought
[44:17.700 --> 44:18.620]  about in that time either.
[44:18.620 --> 44:22.260]  The premise of having those but for pain is terrifying.
[44:22.560 --> 44:26.900]  I wonder if anybody's ever stubbed their toe, like getting up on their coffee table and
[44:26.900 --> 44:30.480]  then remembered being kidnapped by Russian drug dealers when they were six.
[44:31.700 --> 44:33.300]  And they just repressed it.
[44:33.520 --> 44:36.020]  Oh, that reminded me when the Russian drug dealer stepped on my toe.
[44:36.160 --> 44:37.180]  Oh, fuck, I was kidnapped.
[44:38.040 --> 44:42.800]  Anytime Harry or Marv have to paint a house, it's just trauma.
[44:43.800 --> 44:45.440]  They just see the paint cans.
[44:48.480 --> 44:49.820]  PTSD from a previous career.
[44:51.220 --> 44:53.420]  Oh, man, they would have the worst PTSD, right?
[44:54.120 --> 44:55.040]  They went through a lot.
[44:55.180 --> 44:55.580]  Those two.
[44:55.960 --> 44:57.760]  Well, they had a lot of time in prison to think it over.
[44:59.220 --> 45:00.880]  Well, they escaped their family, too.
[45:01.220 --> 45:01.740]  That's true.
[45:02.100 --> 45:06.800]  One of the greatest things anyone has ever given me, by the way, is TPG's screenplay
[45:06.800 --> 45:08.620]  for Home Alone 2.
[45:08.860 --> 45:11.780]  I don't even know if it would be, I guess, a direct sequel.
[45:11.920 --> 45:13.300]  Not necessarily two because there was a two.
[45:14.520 --> 45:16.740]  This episode is brought to you by Diet Coke.
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.680]  You know that moment when you just need to hit pause and refresh?
[45:20.260 --> 45:22.200]  An ice-cold Diet Coke isn't just a break.
[45:22.420 --> 45:25.680]  It's your chance to catch your breath and savor a moment that's all about you.
[45:26.040 --> 45:28.440]  Always refreshing, still the same great taste.
[45:28.840 --> 45:29.360]  Diet Coke.
[45:29.600 --> 45:30.760]  Make time for you time.
[45:33.520 --> 45:36.440]  Your earbud fell in a coffee cup.
[45:36.860 --> 45:39.560]  You need a taco pick-me-up.
[45:40.480 --> 45:43.880]  When modern life gets rough, grab the timeless, tasty love.
[45:44.360 --> 45:46.580]  Paso the old El Paso.
[45:47.880 --> 45:49.480]  I had a surprise this week from Meg.
[45:50.700 --> 45:53.380]  She listened to an episode of this podcast.
[45:53.520 --> 45:53.700]  Why?
[45:53.840 --> 45:54.280]  Oh, no.
[45:54.280 --> 45:54.640]  For the first time.
[45:54.960 --> 45:55.360]  Why?
[45:55.760 --> 45:57.180]  Was it to, like, get you?
[45:57.640 --> 46:00.300]  No, she just thought, you know, other people listen to it.
[46:00.340 --> 46:01.280]  I might as well see what it's all about.
[46:02.440 --> 46:03.700]  What a time to start.
[46:04.060 --> 46:06.700]  I like Meg too much to make her listen to the show.
[46:07.360 --> 46:08.200]  Yeah, I know.
[46:08.260 --> 46:08.880]  What did she think?
[46:08.880 --> 46:10.000]  Does she like us less now?
[46:10.420 --> 46:15.640]  Now I think she's going to go back to the beginning of F*** Face and get the whole war going.
[46:16.000 --> 46:19.600]  But she started off by listening to last week's episode.
[46:20.020 --> 46:22.960]  And I've just discovered something slightly disturbing.
[46:23.560 --> 46:26.700]  She's a total Andrew sympathizer.
[46:26.920 --> 46:27.260]  What?
[46:28.180 --> 46:29.700]  Pretty much everything Andrew said.
[46:29.800 --> 46:31.600]  She was like, yeah, I totally get where he's coming from.
[46:32.020 --> 46:33.060]  The enemy from within.
[46:33.360 --> 46:33.680]  Wow.
[46:34.280 --> 46:35.280]  Here's the thing, though, with that.
[46:35.680 --> 46:38.760]  I feel like I saw that way more for that episode
[46:38.760 --> 46:40.240]  than I have for any other episode.
[46:40.420 --> 46:41.700]  So that is true.
[46:42.000 --> 46:43.700]  There might be a false confidence.
[46:43.980 --> 46:45.520]  I think that is not going to stick around.
[46:45.820 --> 46:48.180]  So what were we wrong about that you were right about last episode?
[46:48.800 --> 46:51.120]  Uh, I think people not even necessarily wrong,
[46:51.200 --> 46:53.660]  but people are like, oh, yeah, I knew what he meant by sleep amnesia.
[46:54.100 --> 46:55.780]  Um, what was the other thing?
[46:55.860 --> 46:56.960]  There was a lot of stuff.
[46:57.100 --> 47:00.680]  Like there were an inordinate amount of posts where people are going,
[47:00.760 --> 47:03.000]  I totally sided with Andrew on all this stuff.
[47:03.080 --> 47:04.620]  Oh, I knew exactly who he was talking about.
[47:04.700 --> 47:08.380]  And it's like, I don't even know what it was that we were like,
[47:08.960 --> 47:09.720]  squabbling about.
[47:09.960 --> 47:11.440]  Oh, you know what part of it was?
[47:11.820 --> 47:14.520]  The real nerds came out to back me on Peter Molyneux.
[47:15.060 --> 47:16.800]  Oh, the Peter Molyneux stuff!
[47:17.500 --> 47:20.440]  All the real gamer nerds that have spent too much time
[47:20.440 --> 47:23.860]  reading about Peter Molyneux like I have were like, no, he is right.
[47:24.280 --> 47:26.160]  A hundred percent Peter Molyneux love.
[47:26.240 --> 47:29.080]  I still stand by Populous, Fable 1, 2, and 3
[47:29.080 --> 47:31.240]  being awesome fucking games that I thoroughly enjoyed.
[47:31.320 --> 47:33.240]  And I appreciate Peter Molyneux for this.
[47:33.560 --> 47:34.520]  I appreciate those as well.
[47:34.640 --> 47:36.880]  Maybe the full name thing, too.
[47:36.880 --> 47:38.820]  Oh, yeah, that was another one.
[47:38.920 --> 47:39.820]  Yeah, that was something.
[47:40.000 --> 47:41.660]  I was surprised people don't put their full.
[47:41.680 --> 47:42.960]  Like, what do you think full name is?
[47:43.380 --> 47:46.140]  Like, if the glass is full, I can't fit any more into it.
[47:46.600 --> 47:48.200]  That's what I learned about burger eating.
[47:48.900 --> 47:49.300]  What?
[47:50.060 --> 47:53.200]  That was that was when I was going back to the old things.
[47:53.300 --> 47:54.900]  That was just how stomachs work.
[47:54.980 --> 47:56.480]  Oh, so I could never do the burger challenge.
[47:56.640 --> 47:58.880]  He's going back to fucking phase 32.
[48:00.660 --> 48:02.680]  That's what I learned about burger eating.
[48:03.140 --> 48:04.760]  Well, whatever I hear, there's a limit.
[48:04.840 --> 48:06.040]  That's always what I imagine.
[48:06.040 --> 48:10.480]  Because you eat, you when you go in, you sort of have this idea that,
[48:10.620 --> 48:12.780]  like, your stomach is endless, but that's not how that works.
[48:12.920 --> 48:14.100]  It's like you have a glass.
[48:14.300 --> 48:16.840]  I don't think I've ever thought my stomach was endless.
[48:17.200 --> 48:19.760]  Yeah, but you also don't think much about food in general.
[48:19.860 --> 48:23.120]  So that's I would never accuse you of ever having
[48:24.340 --> 48:27.000]  eyes greater than your stomach, whatever that phrase is.
[48:27.240 --> 48:29.980]  It is interesting, though, to think about your eating speed,
[48:30.220 --> 48:34.100]  like the speed that it physically moves out of your stomach into your intestines.
[48:34.100 --> 48:39.540]  Could you just keep food coming like a conveyor belt at the exact speed of your digestion?
[48:41.580 --> 48:43.200]  Uh, theoretically, I think you could.
[48:43.480 --> 48:44.320]  I think you could.
[48:44.440 --> 48:49.680]  But I think that song that goes doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
[48:49.680 --> 48:50.800]  would have to do it.
[48:50.880 --> 48:52.460]  And we'd have to see the food going down
[48:52.460 --> 48:56.020]  conveyor belt style into your stomach and then down out of your ass.
[48:56.300 --> 48:57.460]  It also takes too long.
[48:58.500 --> 49:01.880]  That was my problem is whenever we do these burger bets that I would lose them.
[49:01.880 --> 49:04.280]  It was because the digestion took longer than the bet.
[49:04.420 --> 49:07.360]  It's like, oh, I got no time to refuel.
[49:07.920 --> 49:10.400]  Well, yeah, that's the whole point is like it's not interesting
[49:10.400 --> 49:13.200]  if you ate a hundred hamburgers over the space of a year.
[49:13.320 --> 49:14.880]  And yet we're counting hot dogs.
[49:15.840 --> 49:16.520]  Well, that's true.
[49:21.260 --> 49:22.460]  Megan agreed with me on that one.
[49:22.560 --> 49:25.000]  Oh, people also agreed with you on the Acclaim logo.
[49:25.100 --> 49:25.540]  That's right.
[49:25.940 --> 49:27.500]  Meg said Megan.
[49:27.660 --> 49:28.120]  That was weird.
[49:28.120 --> 49:28.700]  What?
[49:30.540 --> 49:32.140]  Make sure she listens to that.
[49:32.380 --> 49:33.100]  Yeah, I was straight.
[49:33.540 --> 49:36.040]  Well, she started at the beginning now, so she wouldn't hear this one.
[49:37.160 --> 49:38.120]  Oh, that's good.
[49:38.360 --> 49:39.060]  Slip that in.
[49:39.100 --> 49:39.580]  That's pretty good.
[49:39.620 --> 49:41.580]  I've already lost Meg by this point.
[49:41.640 --> 49:42.040]  That's fine.
[49:42.240 --> 49:42.700]  Never mind.
[49:43.160 --> 49:49.960]  It's one thing to go back and listen to 250 episodes of a or I guess 280 episodes.
[49:50.100 --> 49:51.680]  No, about 250 episodes of a show.
[49:52.440 --> 49:56.020]  But it's another thing to go back and listen to 250 episodes of show
[49:56.020 --> 50:00.760]  starring your husband that all happened in your house while you were living there.
[50:00.800 --> 50:06.720]  What a weird like she's going to have so many like memory connections to things that happened
[50:06.720 --> 50:09.860]  in the house that are going to she's going to have context for now.
[50:09.960 --> 50:10.500]  You know what I mean?
[50:10.820 --> 50:11.060]  Yeah.
[50:11.340 --> 50:12.800]  And it's a real time capsule, too.
[50:12.880 --> 50:17.560]  She's about to fill in like the last five years of of like confusion in her life.
[50:19.400 --> 50:22.740]  Yeah, I think the first episode is a half an hour conversation about turnip prices.
[50:23.280 --> 50:24.200]  Animal Crossing.
[50:24.840 --> 50:25.900]  Kicked it all off.
[50:26.540 --> 50:30.440]  Well, I'm in a new era personally because I'm I'm on that CPAP now.
[50:30.780 --> 50:31.520]  I'm a threat.
[50:31.800 --> 50:32.660]  Oh, yeah.
[50:33.100 --> 50:34.140]  Danger to society.
[50:34.440 --> 50:35.300]  How'd you sleep last night?
[50:35.780 --> 50:37.480]  Uh, it's it's been a journey.
[50:37.560 --> 50:40.120]  It's been a little bit of roller coaster overall.
[50:40.720 --> 50:47.600]  So I started and I fell asleep and I had a great sleep and I woke up and then we've been
[50:47.600 --> 50:53.720]  doing Mario Party March where every morning I have to get up and play one turn and then
[50:53.720 --> 50:55.600]  previously would just go back to sleep.
[50:56.760 --> 51:01.480]  I went to bed early because I thought, I don't know how this is going to impact my sleep.
[51:01.740 --> 51:02.680]  So I'm going to be careful.
[51:02.820 --> 51:10.420]  So I went to bed at 830, woke up at 1130, was awake for about an hour, then went back to sleep
[51:10.420 --> 51:16.380]  and woke up at around 5 a.m. and thought, I'll just stay awake to be safe, to be cautious.
[51:17.100 --> 51:20.500]  I did that for an hour and then I got kind of sleepy again and I thought,
[51:20.540 --> 51:24.800]  I can sleep for 45 minutes and trust that I'll set my alarm as I did.
[51:24.860 --> 51:25.540]  Everything's fine.
[51:26.060 --> 51:33.000]  I then woke up with my partner standing above me and all of the lights on in the bedroom
[51:33.560 --> 51:35.740]  saying, you're late, you're late.
[51:36.640 --> 51:37.940]  I'd slept through.
[51:38.320 --> 51:41.500]  It was the wildest, like, I guess I had like.
[51:42.480 --> 51:48.800]  Six months of bad sleep that I cleansed in one evening and they had spent like 15 minutes
[51:48.800 --> 51:50.800]  trying to wake me and they could not wake me.
[51:51.220 --> 51:58.080]  And I woke up in such a panic rushing to that Mario Party turn because we had recently done
[51:58.080 --> 52:03.080]  a pet peeves draft and one of us drafted general lateness.
[52:03.360 --> 52:09.840]  So when I heard you're late, my first thought was, oh, no, this person's going to be so peeved.
[52:09.840 --> 52:13.980]  And so I panicked and none of my setup would work.
[52:14.040 --> 52:16.840]  And it was great because you all were like, what's going on?
[52:16.880 --> 52:18.060]  And I'm like, I'm so sorry.
[52:18.280 --> 52:19.780]  I just started CPAP.
[52:19.840 --> 52:21.880]  And then there was a lot of excitement around it.
[52:21.880 --> 52:23.420]  Yeah, because you sounded completely different.
[52:23.540 --> 52:25.300]  You didn't sound like morning and croaky.
[52:25.420 --> 52:26.980]  You were like, oh, hey, sorry.
[52:27.020 --> 52:29.780]  I just had a really great sleep.
[52:30.080 --> 52:31.460]  We talked about it later.
[52:31.560 --> 52:34.840]  It was like it was like talking to an Andrew from 2022.
[52:35.380 --> 52:36.400]  It was so weird.
[52:36.560 --> 52:38.800]  You were you were a different person.
[52:38.800 --> 52:41.980]  And I think we all immediately loved it.
[52:42.000 --> 52:42.480]  It was great.
[52:42.600 --> 52:49.120]  No offense to current Andrew, but we were just really excited to see how rested you were.
[52:49.260 --> 52:53.680]  I don't think you sounded that like just at peace with yourself in a year.
[52:54.260 --> 52:55.340]  Yeah, it's phenomenal.
[52:55.620 --> 52:59.460]  Well, we also like I'm generally not a morning person, which is tough, especially with CPAP
[52:59.460 --> 53:01.280]  stuff and just with the time zones.
[53:01.400 --> 53:05.540]  I have to get up earlier than you guys for everything that we do or start earlier than
[53:05.540 --> 53:06.880]  I would necessarily enjoy.
[53:06.880 --> 53:11.220]  But so we did that.
[53:11.240 --> 53:15.660]  And then I went back to bed after that Mario Party turn like this is great sleep.
[53:15.740 --> 53:18.300]  I just slept essentially that whole day.
[53:18.460 --> 53:19.160]  It was crazy.
[53:19.440 --> 53:20.380]  Put the mask on.
[53:20.480 --> 53:20.860]  Come on.
[53:20.880 --> 53:26.280]  The only problem I had was that well, actually a few problems, but one of them was that it's
[53:26.280 --> 53:28.140]  created a bruise on my nose.
[53:28.360 --> 53:29.940]  I need to get a different mask.
[53:31.940 --> 53:34.800]  It's just it doesn't quite fit right and clamp it down.
[53:34.800 --> 53:39.400]  But the bigger problem was I realized that I don't know how sleep works anymore.
[53:39.500 --> 53:46.260]  I'm having to reeducate myself on sleep because when you are never actually getting good sleep,
[53:46.260 --> 53:49.020]  you constantly have the ability to sleep.
[53:49.300 --> 53:54.740]  So I slept the whole day and then I laid in bed at like 11 p.m.
[53:54.740 --> 54:00.040]  that night and I put the mask on and I sat there for 30 minutes and just it was so weird.
[54:00.160 --> 54:02.540]  Sleep didn't occur as I guess.
[54:02.620 --> 54:03.720]  I guess I'm just not sleepy.
[54:03.720 --> 54:05.720]  I guess I just can't just sleep.
[54:06.840 --> 54:11.380]  And so then I fucked up my sleep that night because like I slept too much during the day.
[54:11.640 --> 54:14.840]  I haven't had to think about like, oh, I need to.
[54:14.980 --> 54:16.080]  I have so much of this.
[54:16.560 --> 54:17.720]  I can overdo this.
[54:18.200 --> 54:19.360]  So that was the whole thing.
[54:20.360 --> 54:22.560]  First night of CPAP, it was like I was in a time machine.
[54:22.740 --> 54:24.880]  I would instantly fall asleep for like eight hours.
[54:24.900 --> 54:25.380]  It was great.
[54:25.780 --> 54:29.020]  Second night disaster because I had spent so much time sleeping.
[54:29.460 --> 54:33.540]  The previous terrible sleep couldn't get the mask to fit properly
[54:33.540 --> 54:36.420]  because I do still have a giant head and I don't.
[54:36.540 --> 54:40.040]  The straps barely work, but I do get them to work at certain angles.
[54:42.380 --> 54:43.980]  I experienced your thing, Gavin.
[54:44.080 --> 54:45.860]  I had a gassy gut yesterday.
[54:46.600 --> 54:47.680]  I sure did.
[54:49.760 --> 54:50.880]  I woke up.
[54:50.940 --> 54:52.320]  I was like, oh, this is real unpleasant.
[54:52.440 --> 54:53.680]  I don't want to deal with this.
[54:54.200 --> 54:55.360]  I see what he was talking about.
[54:55.640 --> 54:57.060]  Did it come out your mouth or your anus?
[54:58.120 --> 54:58.960]  Anus for sure.
[54:59.980 --> 55:04.400]  I had to use the bathroom and I didn't realize that until I was on the toilet of like,
[55:04.500 --> 55:06.200]  oh boy, I am aired up right now.
[55:06.280 --> 55:07.260]  This is crazy.
[55:08.340 --> 55:13.340]  I actually think that the air was probably the cause of me having to use the bathroom.
[55:13.860 --> 55:16.100]  Yeah, it was phantom poop pot, potentially.
[55:16.300 --> 55:17.000]  It was, yeah.
[55:17.900 --> 55:19.240]  So that has been that experience.
[55:19.340 --> 55:22.000]  I'm on day three, still learning how sleep works.
[55:22.420 --> 55:23.600]  I think I'm going to get there.
[55:23.920 --> 55:27.580]  I love the fact that you've been operating this whole like last six months,
[55:27.580 --> 55:30.900]  like one of those old phones that when they run a battery,
[55:31.080 --> 55:33.900]  if you just wait a bit, you can turn it back on and it will operate
[55:35.040 --> 55:38.280]  at dog shit levels until it turns off again.
[55:38.540 --> 55:40.140]  You've just been doing life like that.
[55:40.260 --> 55:41.800]  It's like a drained phone battery.
[55:42.260 --> 55:44.400]  Yeah, but now it's expectation.
[55:45.600 --> 55:52.860]  So I've had an issue where this morning I went to sleep and now when I wake up from CPAP
[55:52.860 --> 55:54.560]  and it's a good CPAP sleep, I'll go like,
[55:54.560 --> 55:59.740]  Oh, how far into the future have I gone now in this magical?
[56:00.360 --> 56:03.560]  Oh, wait, this is 80 minutes.
[56:03.940 --> 56:07.560]  This is no, no, this is not how this works.
[56:08.080 --> 56:12.180]  So I felt like Superman for one day because it's like the sleep was insane.
[56:12.420 --> 56:14.240]  I was having ridiculous dreams.
[56:14.300 --> 56:18.200]  And now I think I'm just returning to earth as a normal person.
[56:18.200 --> 56:20.040]  But it is a process.
[56:20.400 --> 56:22.280]  You just discovered drug addiction.
[56:22.280 --> 56:24.740]  The first time you do it, it's so fucking great.
[56:24.880 --> 56:26.000]  It solves all your problems.
[56:26.160 --> 56:27.160]  You have the best day of your life.
[56:27.420 --> 56:29.720]  And then the next day, it's not quite as good and not quite as good.
[56:29.780 --> 56:31.640]  And you're just like, why the fuck isn't it like day one?
[56:31.940 --> 56:33.740]  Third day, I'm on it a little bit.
[56:33.860 --> 56:36.020]  But you guys are gonna be like, oh, man, he's papping too hard.
[56:36.440 --> 56:37.600]  He's got a bruise on his nose.
[56:37.860 --> 56:39.120]  I can see that scam.
[56:39.620 --> 56:40.800]  Andrew, you're out of control, man.
[56:42.440 --> 56:44.620]  So you've gone full face instead of just nose.
[56:45.720 --> 56:49.880]  Yeah, I bought a new mask that I think is it will work better for that.
[56:49.880 --> 56:55.080]  Um, I also just not realizing how the how it should work.
[56:55.120 --> 56:58.380]  Like, I don't think I had a good seal on it the first night I used it at all,
[56:58.380 --> 57:01.740]  because it just keeps blowing air into your face.
[57:03.420 --> 57:04.900]  And I had to sneeze.
[57:05.040 --> 57:05.860]  That's another thing.
[57:05.880 --> 57:06.680]  I'm learning new things.
[57:06.940 --> 57:09.080]  I had my first CPAP sneeze last night.
[57:09.200 --> 57:10.120]  That was a panic.
[57:10.780 --> 57:11.220]  Terrifying.
[57:11.900 --> 57:14.620]  You get all strapped up and then you realize you have to sneeze.
[57:14.740 --> 57:17.940]  There's five seconds of trying to get the mask off because I feel like
[57:18.460 --> 57:22.040]  sneezing in a CPAP mask, a full face mask, would be terrible.
[57:23.320 --> 57:26.360]  What if CPAP was short for CPAP smear?
[57:28.460 --> 57:31.500]  Oh, that would be a different product then, I think, if that's what it was.
[57:31.560 --> 57:33.220]  Trying to figure out what that what that product would do.
[57:33.620 --> 57:37.320]  Yeah, I'm trying to think if there's anything I'm still learning.
[57:37.400 --> 57:38.840]  I'll give an update next week.
[57:38.880 --> 57:42.740]  I'm sure I will continue to learn things of how humans actually operate.
[57:43.340 --> 57:46.420]  But I had to get used to the fact that there was something on my face.
[57:46.420 --> 57:49.540]  Before I went with the nose one, I had the whole mouth and nose one.
[57:49.880 --> 57:53.920]  And I tried to take a pill and I forgot to take the thing off.
[57:54.100 --> 57:56.820]  Just crashed into my face and flew onto the floor.
[57:57.360 --> 57:59.260]  You kind of just forget that you've got something right there.
[58:00.160 --> 58:03.760]  I just visualize when I have problems with it and not that I've had problems.
[58:03.920 --> 58:08.280]  But my strategy going in was that I'm just a fighter pilot in Independence Day
[58:08.280 --> 58:11.820]  with my mask and I'm not going to be a bitch like Harry Connick Jr.
[58:11.900 --> 58:12.840]  and rip that mask off.
[58:12.980 --> 58:14.140]  I'm going to I'm locked in.
[58:14.540 --> 58:16.400]  I'm not going to crash my goddamn jet.
[58:17.680 --> 58:19.380]  Why did he take the mask off in that?
[58:19.520 --> 58:22.900]  I don't know, because I think in the movie it's like he runs out of oxygen.
[58:22.900 --> 58:25.840]  But that's the thing that provides the oxygen, I think.
[58:26.340 --> 58:29.500]  Yeah, well, I mean, if you if you're connected to air and the air runs out,
[58:29.540 --> 58:32.740]  it is worse to be breathing an empty pipe than just the air.
[58:33.260 --> 58:34.680]  That's true. It'll squeeze your face.
[58:34.820 --> 58:38.880]  We've recently learned if you try to breathe into an empty pipe.
[58:39.860 --> 58:41.040]  But that has been my CPAP journey.
[58:41.260 --> 58:43.140]  I'll keep you updated. Gavin has been texting me.
[58:44.060 --> 58:45.940]  I at some point I ran out of water.
[58:45.940 --> 58:48.100]  I guess I got to change the water on it.
[58:48.100 --> 58:49.560]  Does yours use distilled water?
[58:49.980 --> 58:52.140]  Yes. So you're a.
[58:52.860 --> 58:55.400]  This is probably my biggest piece of advice to you with the PAP.
[58:55.720 --> 59:00.360]  And because you're a messy bastard, you clean it, clean it, clean it, clean it.
[59:00.400 --> 59:01.660]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[59:02.440 --> 59:03.920]  Can I express some ignorance?
[59:04.280 --> 59:05.520]  What is the water for?
[59:06.200 --> 59:07.300]  It's a humidifier.
[59:07.760 --> 59:10.060]  So I thought it just pumped oxygen into you.
[59:10.080 --> 59:11.600]  I didn't realize it was humid oxygen.
[59:11.740 --> 59:12.840]  I guess I mean, me neither.
[59:12.940 --> 59:13.540]  Had no idea.
[59:13.880 --> 59:14.880]  Well, it's not just air.
[59:14.920 --> 59:15.760]  It's just pumping air.
[59:17.140 --> 59:19.320]  OK, I did have you know what, Gavin?
[59:19.700 --> 59:21.100]  You just use nose, right?
[59:21.140 --> 59:21.940]  You don't use the full mask.
[59:22.400 --> 59:22.560]  Yeah.
[59:23.040 --> 59:28.500]  I had an issue last night where I took some air in and I stored it in my cheeks.
[59:28.780 --> 59:30.020]  Oh, that was nuts.
[59:31.000 --> 59:33.880]  And because of that, I could never.
[59:34.000 --> 59:35.420]  It was then pumping too much air.
[59:35.580 --> 59:41.520]  I can never adjust the balance because it thought the air was more air was needed than actually was.
[59:41.760 --> 59:43.020]  I did not know how to.
[59:43.080 --> 59:45.460]  I had to take the whole mask off because I didn't know how to.
[59:46.320 --> 59:50.200]  React or counter the amount of airflow that was being shoved into my face.
[59:50.380 --> 59:51.560]  Yeah, that happens to me sometimes.
[59:51.560 --> 59:55.060]  But because I have the just the nose thing on, I can vent.
[59:55.580 --> 59:59.680]  So if my cheeks are puffed up, sometimes I'll be like nodding off and I'll come back around.
[59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.980]  My cheeks will be full of air and I just have to be like.
[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:07.460]  I don't got a vent.
[01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:09.020]  I don't have a vent.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.320]  So I need to figure out that system, I guess.
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:15.860]  It must be such a good night of sleep because it sounds like you guys have made sleep so
[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:16.420]  complicated.
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:19.860]  If you can sleep without one, you're lucky.
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:21.780]  It is nice.
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.320]  I haven't slept this good since I was.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:25.760]  I don't know.
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:26.520]  It's been a while.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:28.180]  It's been a few different apartments.
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:32.440]  It's crazy to just close your eyes and then wake up.
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:33.600]  And it's different.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.080]  The time is completely different.
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:37.660]  So what would it be before, though?
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:40.180]  Because you said you used to just be sat up.
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:46.580]  I'd sit up and then I would fall asleep and then I'd wake up and I'd look at my phone and
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.740]  it would probably be like 50 minutes.
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:57.740]  50 minutes later, I did when I did my test, I had like 105 disturbances an hour and I'm
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:59.180]  averaging less than one.
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:02.260]  So it is a dramatically different sleep experience.
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:07.320]  And I was getting like 20 something an hour and that was enough to prescribe a CPAP.
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:11.360]  So the fact that you had 100, that was like that's almost two a minute.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.200]  Yeah, I was doing burger numbers.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.700]  I didn't even know it.
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:18.180]  That's crazy.
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.220]  I'm so happy that you're going to become a regular human.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:24.140]  You're going to become like a superpowered man who can sleep.
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.440]  It's crazy.
[01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:29.520]  But realizing that it's not a superpower and that you have to you have to limit it.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:33.560]  It's not a time machine because it really felt like a time machine after night one.
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:36.360]  And as I said, you brought back to earth on it.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.520]  You have to use your power responsibly.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.720]  Yeah, I'm cleaning it too.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:44.340]  Just like the idea of like one one second it was pitch black and you were just
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:48.260]  testing this thing out and then suddenly you're six minutes late for Mario Party.
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:49.620]  Terrified.
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.420]  Not even knowing that I could be.
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.860]  I drank a Red Bull in that time as well.
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:59.340]  When you told us that it was CPAP, it changed everyone's tune from like,
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:02.180]  oh, we're going to give him shit to dude, that's so odd.
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.240]  Oh, I'm so happy for you.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.400]  You were also supportive.
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:05.140]  It was so sweet.
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:10.080]  It was we were so supportive and then thought about it later and went like he the way you
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.500]  sounded, I know Jeff brought it up earlier, but like.
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:15.920]  It was so, hey, what's going on?
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:18.420]  You were different, you were a different person.
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:23.340]  Hey, it was like, are you okay?
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:29.380]  I think I was still very much out of it.
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:33.300]  And if it was another scenario, me being seven minutes late,
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:36.320]  I either would have been much more aggressively apologetic
[01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:40.480]  and or much more just prepared to defend myself for whatever had occurred.
[01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:44.380]  I think the fact that we're playing Mario Party so early for you every morning
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:46.580]  is really detrimental to your gameplay.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.500]  But you're making some nuts decisions.
[01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:50.940]  I disagree there.
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:55.720]  So we filmed turn 14 today, which if you haven't watched, please check it.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:56.800]  We're doing a thing.
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:57.880]  We're playing Mario Party every day.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:02.080]  I'm sure, you know, but we're doing it every day and we're releasing it the following day.
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:05.120]  We're doing 30 turns, so 30 consecutive days of this.
[01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:07.480]  We are at turn 15.
[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:10.540]  We just did turn 14 today, or I guess tomorrow we'll do 15.
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:17.560]  And it has been an insane process because we do it first thing in the morning every day.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.800]  For me, at least, 6.30 a.m.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.680]  Yeah, is when I wake up.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.540]  It's such a weird way to start the day.
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:26.840]  Yeah, we are waking up together every day for a month.
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:29.620]  And I'm very excited for that to end,
[01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:33.580]  as much as I also love spending that morning time with you all.
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:35.900]  I don't think it impacted my gameplay today.
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:40.780]  My bad sleep apnea night definitely impacted the mini game I did with Jeff,
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:44.200]  where we had to do basic math on rotating the platform.
[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:48.880]  Oh my God, what a day of that, man.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:49.600]  That was crazy.
[01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:51.500]  I reached out to Jeff as soon as we finished.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:52.640]  I said that was on me.
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:53.820]  I will make up for it.
[01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:54.400]  I'm sorry.
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:55.700]  It was brutal.
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:57.000]  That was so funny.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.300]  He apologized to me.
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:03:59.980]  Because I can handle one.
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:03.220]  So it was a thing where, like, there'd be three things you needed to dodge.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:06.940]  And I was really good at locking in on making sure one of those things didn't happen.
[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:11.740]  And I could not do anything about the other things, which was not helpful.
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:14.920]  It's pretty fun, though, to be like on a Saturday playing it and then looking at the map
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:19.260]  and being like, oh, I'm excited to go past that spot maybe in the middle of next week.
[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:19.960]  Yeah.
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:20.440]  Yeah.
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:22.180]  Look out, Wednesday, here I come.
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:28.080]  I get really excited at like 6 a.m. every day if I happen to be awake.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:32.820]  Once the turn is within about an hour or so, like, oh, what's going to happen?
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:34.520]  Who's going to steal something?
[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:35.760]  It's been a lot of fun.
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:41.680]  And it's been surprisingly less heated than I would anticipate to this point.
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:47.400]  But I think that is only going to crank up now as we head into the back half of this game.
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:48.520]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:51.260]  Shit's starting to feel a little real.
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:52.240]  It is.
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:57.500]  There's under the table dealings that have occurred, bribes that have been made.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:59.240]  Some star theft.
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:00.700]  Some star theft.
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:02.220]  Backstabbing.
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:03.480]  Backstabbing.
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:04.740]  Some frontstabbing.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.200]  Some frontstabbing.
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:08.360]  Reconciliation, potentially.
[01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:09.420]  Nope.
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.240]  But that's all video game talk.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.800]  We don't really talk about that on the main podcast.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.520]  We do hope you check it out, though, because it's fucking free
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.520]  and we don't know how to make it easier to watch than that.
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:20.700]  It is. It's on our Patreon every day.
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:24.680]  I guess I could come to your house and show it to you on an iPad every day.
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.280]  That would be hilarious.
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:31.280]  Can you imagine the frequent flyer miles you could rack up doing that?
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:36.900]  An iPad, traveling via an iPad, the show, like it's the Wu-Tang album.
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:41.560]  We should probably wrap up, though.
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:42.640]  We've been going for a little bit.
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:44.980]  I do want to throw this out there before we leave.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.580]  One last idea, since we're kind of in a draft era, I feel like, right now.
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:49.400]  I'm really enjoying it.
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:53.980]  I wanted to throw another one I had onto the pile, if you guys like it.
[01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:55.280]  I already pitched it to some of you.
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.000]  One-hit wonder draft.
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:59.040]  Yes. Yep.
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:00.240]  OK, there you go.
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:00.640]  All right.
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:01.880]  That doesn't have to be music.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.620]  That could be... there's all kinds of one-hit wonders.
[01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:05.000]  Yeah, as immediately...
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:08.240]  And I say this as a big fan of the product itself.
[01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:12.200]  I don't think the Big League Chew guy did anything else but Big League Chew.
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:15.280]  Yeah, I have so many that are so good immediately.
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.200]  I don't want to say them out loud because I don't want to lose them.
[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:17.760]  You know what I mean?
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:19.720]  I don't want to give the good ideas up.
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:21.520]  But yeah, one-hit wonder draft, I think, could be a real good one.
[01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:22.540]  So we should throw that on the pile.
[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.620]  At some point in the undefined future.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.360]  Sorry, specifically about the Big League Chew thing.
[01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:29.220]  That guy was a Major League Baseball player, wasn't he?
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:32.740]  He played for the Portland Hawks.
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.520]  I don't know if he...
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.520]  Did he play in the MLB?
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.240]  I thought he was an MLB player.
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.040]  He could easily be.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:42.420]  Either way, I thought that was a very funny example to be like,
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.760]  this guy's never done anything.
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:44.800]  Major League player.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:45.420]  Ah, shit.
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.480]  He played baseball at definitely a professional level.
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:49.640]  That is true.
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.620]  But Big League Chew, though, that was his hit.
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:56.200]  He was a role player in the dugout and the field.
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:00.600]  Yeah, where was his soccer slam or his football fruities
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.460]  or his other sports-related gums?
[01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:06.520]  In an era where they got rid of all the candy that resembled tobacco,
[01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:08.960]  he ran through it.
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.060]  He held on.
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:11.180]  He made it through that storm.
[01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:13.680]  He's the sole survivor of that.
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:15.920]  Yeah, you got a dick sporting goods right now,
[01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:19.020]  and they sell a tub of Big League Chew right at the counter
[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:20.080]  as you walk out.
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:21.860]  You won't see candy cigarettes anywhere.
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:24.540]  No, it's a lie about what they are.
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:26.220]  They're just like candy sticks now.
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:27.480]  Terrible.
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:30.600]  Do you think we should ever revisit any of our previous discussions
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.640]  from the podcast from before drafts?
[01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:36.840]  Like at one point, we were talking about the best sequels for anything.
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:38.220]  Well, we should.
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:41.060]  We also talked about doing a Worst Third Movies draft, too.
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:42.000]  Oh, yeah.
[01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:45.120]  Man, I don't want to overload the audience with drafts,
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:47.520]  but I feel like we've got so many good drafts on deck.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.520]  I don't think that is a thing.
[01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:51.020]  What, the audience?
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:51.880]  No, they exist.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:53.700]  They're there.
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.280]  Dude, I promise you they're there.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:57.740]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:07:59.840]  Outside of my house?
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.540]  Outside of our homes?
[01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:07.620]  We got Meg on now as a thing.
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:08.380]  We gotta wrap this up.
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:11.140]  Somebody end this thing.
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:14.520]  Now that Andrew's sleeping at night, he's discovering that there's an outside world.
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:15.800]  Wait a second.
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:18.680]  Are you telling me that these things go out to people?
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:22.080]  I think now I'm starting to understand his Costco confusion a little bit better.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:25.740]  Thanks for listening to another episode of The Regulation Podcast.
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:27.440]  We really hope you enjoyed it.
[01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:29.160]  If you did, maybe go on over to our Patreon.
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:31.180]  We are The Regulation Pod over on Patreon.
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:35.220]  And consider watching some of those gameplay videos for free or maybe even
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:38.700]  becoming a member, a paying member or not.
[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:40.100]  I don't care one way or the other.
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:41.500]  I just want you to be happy.
[01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:44.860]  I want you to be the happiest you can be throughout the course of your day.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:48.680]  For some people, that includes Patreon content.
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:51.680]  For a whole lot of people, eight people in the world, right?
[01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:52.860]  Whole lot of people, it doesn't.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.140]  But there are a few that it does.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.620]  So if you're one of those people, that'd be cool.
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:59.980]  Anyway, we sure enjoyed hanging out and having this dumb conversation with you.
[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:04.420]  And hopefully we will see you next week for another episode of The Regulation Podcast.
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.900]  I can't believe you didn't let Nick do the outro.
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:08.980]  Yeah, I thought you did a great job, though.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:09.900]  So we'll see you next time.
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:10.260]  Bye!
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:11.520]  Bye now.
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:12.200]  Don't inhale popcorn!
[01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:12.620]  Bye!
