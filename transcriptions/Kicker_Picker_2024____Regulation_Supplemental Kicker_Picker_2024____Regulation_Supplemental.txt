[00:56.330 --> 00:59.250]  Hello and welcome to another supplemental.
[00:59.910 --> 01:01.870]  As Eric described, this is a kicker picker.
[01:02.270 --> 01:04.230]  We got a kicker picker on our hands.
[01:04.670 --> 01:06.970]  The Summer Movie League is coming to an end.
[01:07.450 --> 01:10.270]  And this is going to be the next thing that lasts several months,
[01:10.290 --> 01:12.190]  competition for us to keep updated on.
[01:12.610 --> 01:15.810]  But before we begin, I have a key question for Gavin.
[01:15.910 --> 01:16.050]  Okay.
[01:16.250 --> 01:18.010]  That he hasn't responded to in days.
[01:18.130 --> 01:19.730]  I asked him for a clarification.
[01:20.370 --> 01:21.330]  He never got back to me.
[01:21.330 --> 01:22.630]  After my clarification.
[01:23.290 --> 01:23.710]  What was this?
[01:23.930 --> 01:26.650]  How do you feel about a kick being worth three points,
[01:26.790 --> 01:28.850]  as opposed to it being worth one?
[01:29.370 --> 01:29.990]  Oh, in football?
[01:30.770 --> 01:31.570]  Yeah, in football.
[01:32.530 --> 01:32.930]  Soccer.
[01:33.470 --> 01:35.110]  I was saying soccer, hypothetically.
[01:35.150 --> 01:36.450]  I had a follow-up question, didn't I?
[01:37.170 --> 01:38.810]  Yeah, and then I replied to it.
[01:38.950 --> 01:39.330]  Oh, shit.
[01:41.590 --> 01:41.990]  Fascinating.
[01:42.310 --> 01:44.370]  My question was, what would be worth one point?
[01:44.830 --> 01:46.150]  So I came up with a whole system.
[01:46.290 --> 01:46.810]  I was trying to...
[01:46.810 --> 01:52.250]  Gavin, his problem with football in the past has been that one point is worth six.
[01:52.710 --> 01:53.250]  Too high.
[01:54.250 --> 01:59.070]  So I was trying to find a lower ground, which is kickers.
[01:59.190 --> 02:02.090]  Also, Gavin loves soccer, aka football.
[02:02.590 --> 02:06.350]  So I thought the best way to get us all on board, because the rest of us have
[02:06.350 --> 02:10.730]  varying degrees of interest in football already, is to focus on football,
[02:10.830 --> 02:12.210]  but just the kicking part.
[02:12.510 --> 02:15.150]  Just the part where they kick the ball into a goal.
[02:15.150 --> 02:17.090]  Because Gavin likes that already.
[02:17.630 --> 02:21.750]  But before we can pick, we need to decide, are we only focusing on one kick, one point,
[02:21.870 --> 02:24.910]  or is Gavin okay with one kick being worth three points?
[02:26.770 --> 02:30.690]  If you kicked it within the keeper box, it's one, but further out, it's three.
[02:31.030 --> 02:34.630]  That analogy really isn't specific to this.
[02:34.730 --> 02:36.930]  That was me trying to equate soccer to football.
[02:36.950 --> 02:37.970]  It's not a distance thing.
[02:38.050 --> 02:39.230]  It's a situational thing.
[02:39.430 --> 02:43.950]  And sometimes a kick in American football, or gridiron, as you people call it,
[02:43.950 --> 02:48.970]  is worth three points when it's a field goal, and one point when it's an extra point,
[02:49.170 --> 02:50.350]  scored after a touchdown.
[02:50.810 --> 02:53.270]  I would think that we'd want to maintain that integrity.
[02:53.710 --> 02:59.170]  I just wanted to see where Gavin was at with it before we advanced, if he was okay with that.
[02:59.970 --> 03:00.310]  Sure.
[03:00.630 --> 03:03.170]  I mean, I just grew up with, you know, everything's one point.
[03:04.590 --> 03:05.710]  But that's not even...
[03:05.710 --> 03:06.310]  Okay.
[03:06.610 --> 03:06.950]  Fair enough.
[03:07.070 --> 03:07.490]  You're right.
[03:07.630 --> 03:10.670]  But there are soccer games where the ball's worth more than one.
[03:10.990 --> 03:11.530]  That's fine.
[03:11.930 --> 03:12.730]  Like a golden goal?
[03:12.730 --> 03:14.490]  Yeah, like a golden goal scenario.
[03:14.730 --> 03:15.090]  Exactly.
[03:15.510 --> 03:20.930]  Anyway, we have a board of all the NFL kickers we're looking at in front of us.
[03:21.430 --> 03:23.150]  I have listed their teams.
[03:23.590 --> 03:27.150]  I've listed how many times they've kicked the ball in the NFL.
[03:27.690 --> 03:30.550]  And a photo of who they are alongside it.
[03:30.930 --> 03:31.950]  The photo really helps.
[03:32.190 --> 03:35.630]  I think the photo is such an improvement here.
[03:35.750 --> 03:36.090]  I think that's true.
[03:36.090 --> 03:37.850]  I think you got to really lock in on the photos.
[03:37.850 --> 03:44.050]  These are their official NFL profile photos, which is sort of insane for some of them.
[03:44.630 --> 03:45.650]  We have a whole list.
[03:45.870 --> 03:47.350]  White guy, white guy, white guy, white guy, white guy.
[03:47.390 --> 03:48.190]  It's all white guys.
[03:48.410 --> 03:51.250]  It doesn't, it doesn't stop.
[03:51.710 --> 03:52.570]  It's a bunch of white guys.
[03:53.210 --> 03:53.310]  Interesting.
[03:53.370 --> 03:55.970]  Oh, no, there's there's one, at least, that isn't white.
[03:56.170 --> 03:57.090]  Oh, the Falcons kicker.
[03:57.130 --> 03:57.630]  That's pretty cool.
[03:57.690 --> 03:58.070]  Yeah, Young Ogu.
[03:58.670 --> 03:58.890]  Yeah.
[03:59.510 --> 04:00.150]  Awesome kicker.
[04:00.470 --> 04:01.350]  So we are going to go through.
[04:01.470 --> 04:02.070]  We're going to pick.
[04:03.850 --> 04:07.410]  Every field goal gets us three points at the end of the season.
[04:07.410 --> 04:08.550]  Whoever has the most points wins.
[04:09.010 --> 04:09.850]  Pretty simple.
[04:10.390 --> 04:12.250]  We're each picking six kickers.
[04:13.410 --> 04:13.850]  Sixers?
[04:14.070 --> 04:14.890]  And yeah.
[04:15.310 --> 04:16.550]  A six pack kick pack.
[04:17.150 --> 04:17.930]  Six pack.
[04:18.090 --> 04:19.750]  Eric, you are on fire today.
[04:20.410 --> 04:20.850]  Six pack kick pack.
[04:20.850 --> 04:21.830]  This is my wheelhouse.
[04:22.250 --> 04:24.230]  This is this is the only thing I'm good at.
[04:24.410 --> 04:26.690]  It's this and then putting something on a calendar.
[04:28.070 --> 04:30.590]  Yeah, but you fucking you kill it on the calendar.
[04:30.910 --> 04:31.090]  Yeah.
[04:31.090 --> 04:31.490]  Thanks, buddy.
[04:31.910 --> 04:32.810]  Yeah, the calendar is great.
[04:33.270 --> 04:35.510]  How do we want to pick who goes first?
[04:35.510 --> 04:43.750]  Well, we have the that fan made that the official like the unofficial official draft.
[04:43.950 --> 04:44.230]  Uh-huh.
[04:45.110 --> 04:48.550]  I think we can just use that to randomize and see how it goes.
[04:48.630 --> 04:49.410]  How do you feel about that?
[04:49.610 --> 04:50.510]  No problem.
[04:50.990 --> 04:52.410]  You remember that website?
[04:52.790 --> 04:53.650]  Not in the slightest.
[04:54.130 --> 04:56.890]  Yeah, I don't see it.
[04:57.450 --> 04:58.810]  Random.org it is.
[04:59.330 --> 04:59.830]  All right.
[04:59.870 --> 05:01.150]  Let's just do how about this?
[05:01.170 --> 05:02.210]  We've never done this before.
[05:02.450 --> 05:04.250]  Let's do one randomized.
[05:04.690 --> 05:04.950]  Okay.
[05:05.790 --> 05:07.270]  Whoa, just one.
[05:07.270 --> 05:08.910]  This one's always just start.
[05:09.170 --> 05:11.590]  It would just start an egg and then we just hit it once.
[05:11.790 --> 05:13.310]  Oh, are you on your VPN?
[05:14.030 --> 05:14.390]  No.
[05:14.850 --> 05:15.910]  Oh, okay.
[05:16.010 --> 05:16.450]  That's all right.
[05:16.470 --> 05:17.290]  We're only doing it once.
[05:17.350 --> 05:17.590]  It's okay.
[05:17.790 --> 05:21.130]  Just take a screenshot of the thing when it happens.
[05:21.390 --> 05:22.270]  Okay, here we go.
[05:22.670 --> 05:24.510]  I mean, you said you're recording your own thing.
[05:24.850 --> 05:25.690]  Not anymore.
[05:28.190 --> 05:32.730]  I just like the pivot without talking to anyone
[05:32.730 --> 05:36.910]  is like the craziest thing you can do for this fucking show.
[05:37.410 --> 05:38.050]  Like why?
[05:38.350 --> 05:44.890]  Without saying anything to totally pivot off of what you were doing and just expect that,
[05:45.050 --> 05:47.090]  oh yeah, nothing should change here.
[05:47.370 --> 05:48.370]  Like you're nuts.
[05:48.730 --> 05:49.170]  You know what?
[05:49.190 --> 05:49.870]  You're nuts.
[05:50.030 --> 05:50.730]  That's fair, Nick.
[05:51.050 --> 05:51.450]  That's fair.
[05:51.570 --> 05:54.630]  But also I wanted what we saw to be what the audience sees.
[05:54.810 --> 05:57.290]  And if I was just sitting on this page, they wouldn't see the same thing.
[05:57.350 --> 05:58.690]  Anyway, randomized.
[06:00.210 --> 06:01.210]  I appreciate this.
[06:01.210 --> 06:02.870]  One randomization.
[06:03.070 --> 06:03.890]  Here it comes.
[06:05.610 --> 06:08.850]  Nick, Eric, Jeff, Andrew, Gavin.
[06:09.110 --> 06:11.490]  Nick, Eric, Jeff, Andrew, Gavin.
[06:11.950 --> 06:12.430]  Knee gag.
[06:14.650 --> 06:15.310]  Careful.
[06:17.370 --> 06:19.290]  Can we all edit this?
[06:19.970 --> 06:20.110]  Yeah.
[06:21.190 --> 06:21.850]  Yep.
[06:22.530 --> 06:25.150]  Nick, Eric, Jeff, Andrew, Gavin.
[06:25.750 --> 06:29.990]  Nick, Eric, Jeff, Andrew.
[06:31.330 --> 06:34.230]  Somebody else is changing it, so I'm not clicking on anything.
[06:35.430 --> 06:37.890]  I'm going to guess that's Gavin doing that.
[06:38.330 --> 06:38.810]  Oh, that's me.
[06:39.410 --> 06:39.750]  Yeah.
[06:39.810 --> 06:45.070]  Again, the communication that this team has is insane to me.
[06:45.410 --> 06:46.170]  Just call out.
[06:46.490 --> 06:47.110]  I'll do it.
[06:49.630 --> 06:52.450]  Nick, Eric, Jeff, Andrew, Gavin.
[06:52.730 --> 06:53.070]  Why?
[06:53.290 --> 06:55.370]  Why is it happening this way?
[06:55.770 --> 06:55.970]  Okay.
[06:56.050 --> 06:58.950]  How are we so successfully dysfunctional?
[06:59.030 --> 07:00.870]  I just don't understand.
[07:01.830 --> 07:03.250]  Who put me twice?
[07:05.890 --> 07:06.960]  What's going on?
[07:07.850 --> 07:10.510]  I don't know.
[07:11.490 --> 07:13.250]  Maybe we designate a toucher.
[07:13.510 --> 07:17.150]  That person for the rest of this episode is the designated toucher.
[07:17.570 --> 07:21.170]  They do all the touching and diddling and fondling of the CSV file.
[07:21.630 --> 07:24.970]  Everybody move your cursor outside of the video section.
[07:25.110 --> 07:26.640]  Andrew, would you like to...
[07:27.150 --> 07:29.070]  Andrew, do you want to diddle the file?
[07:30.210 --> 07:31.650]  I don't. Am I qualified?
[07:31.770 --> 07:32.950]  Yeah, I can diddle the file.
[07:33.890 --> 07:35.110]  Nick, where do you want my cursor?
[07:36.190 --> 07:38.070]  Well, you're going to be moving it around, so you can do whatever you want.
[07:38.070 --> 07:38.770]  Yeah, so it's fine. Whatever.
[07:39.130 --> 07:40.970]  Okay, I'm not in cursor jail.
[07:41.130 --> 07:43.390]  Hey, who is that?
[07:43.810 --> 07:46.170]  Oh, I see what you're doing, piss boy.
[07:46.530 --> 07:47.330]  I'm not piss boy.
[07:49.070 --> 07:50.050]  That's the old show.
[07:53.450 --> 07:54.550]  Are we going to start?
[07:54.670 --> 07:55.210]  Yeah, are we going to?
[07:55.250 --> 07:55.710]  Let's do it.
[07:56.130 --> 07:56.450]  Okay.
[07:56.890 --> 07:57.750]  Nick, you're on the board.
[07:57.850 --> 07:58.850]  Take your first kicker.
[07:59.070 --> 08:00.890]  Well, I do follow football.
[08:01.190 --> 08:08.110]  This guy was a kicker at both the college I went to and now for the Ravens.
[08:08.190 --> 08:10.410]  It's Justin Tucker, number 26 on this list.
[08:10.410 --> 08:10.510]  God damn it.
[08:10.810 --> 08:12.930]  Yeah, I mean, that's the one.
[08:13.050 --> 08:13.750]  He's the moneymaker.
[08:14.970 --> 08:16.110]  Yeah, he's it.
[08:18.550 --> 08:20.030]  That's on the older end.
[08:20.230 --> 08:21.590]  One of the most kicks in the league.
[08:22.010 --> 08:23.010]  438 kicks.
[08:23.850 --> 08:24.630]  Picking for a while.
[08:25.290 --> 08:26.470]  What are you going to pick, Eric?
[08:28.310 --> 08:30.110]  Well, it's tough.
[08:30.450 --> 08:33.710]  There's a lot that we have here that we can choose from.
[08:33.790 --> 08:38.410]  I could have Will Reichardt, who has never kicked a kick in the NFL.
[08:38.950 --> 08:42.650]  You could have Nick Folk, who appears to be the oldest man playing in the NFL.
[08:42.910 --> 08:46.470]  Nick Folk looks like he's ready to grill for all of the kids.
[08:46.770 --> 08:47.530]  He's like...
[08:48.270 --> 08:50.090]  He looked that way 10 years ago, too.
[08:50.290 --> 08:50.510]  Yeah.
[08:51.310 --> 08:53.510]  He does crawfish boils.
[08:53.510 --> 08:55.570]  Yeah, there's a lot.
[08:55.730 --> 08:56.990]  There's a lot to choose from.
[08:58.070 --> 09:03.450]  But I'm going to take a young gun and I'm going to go Dallas Cowboys Brandon Aubrey.
[09:03.950 --> 09:04.390]  Oh.
[09:04.850 --> 09:05.290]  Yeah.
[09:05.790 --> 09:07.330]  I was getting ready to autofill that for Nick.
[09:07.630 --> 09:08.830]  I know he's a Cowboys guy.
[09:08.890 --> 09:10.650]  You got to take it out from under Nick.
[09:10.770 --> 09:12.830]  I feel good about it.
[09:12.970 --> 09:13.370]  I don't.
[09:14.250 --> 09:21.450]  I think that the Cowboys are mostly going to be settling for field goals all year long.
[09:21.630 --> 09:22.850]  I feel really good about my pick.
[09:22.850 --> 09:24.030]  All right. I'm sitting right here, man.
[09:25.450 --> 09:25.810]  Uh.
[09:26.210 --> 09:28.130]  Okay, well, I'm going to go with my pick.
[09:28.690 --> 09:29.850]  I'm not going to move the board.
[09:29.930 --> 09:31.450]  I'm going to let Andrew do it.
[09:31.510 --> 09:32.890]  I'm going to be respectful of the rules.
[09:33.510 --> 09:36.410]  Andrew, would you go ahead and select for me, go down to the...
[09:36.410 --> 09:37.850]  down to the R's, please.
[09:38.290 --> 09:38.510]  Okay.
[09:39.770 --> 09:40.130]  R.
[09:42.310 --> 09:43.030]  It's Raiders.
[09:43.210 --> 09:43.730]  There we go.
[09:43.810 --> 09:45.610]  I want Daniel Carlson, please.
[09:45.870 --> 09:46.530]  Daniel Carlson.
[09:46.830 --> 09:47.570]  Oh, interesting.
[09:47.870 --> 09:55.270]  The only kicker in the NFL to hit at least 90% of his field goals in each of his past three seasons.
[09:55.690 --> 09:56.310]  Is that right?
[09:57.370 --> 09:58.450]  Supposedly. According to Google.
[10:00.090 --> 10:00.310]  Wow.
[10:01.350 --> 10:05.850]  Andrew, we've had the Ravens, the Cowboys, and the Raiders are off the board.
[10:06.010 --> 10:10.290]  This is tough. See, I'm looking down. Eric, you want to scroll down to the Vikings, Will Riker?
[10:10.650 --> 10:16.090]  Oh, the Vikings. I don't know if I'm gonna take him, but he looks like the asshole in a horror movie.
[10:17.870 --> 10:22.770]  Kind of obnoxious jock that dies early. I don't know if I want that on my squad.
[10:23.710 --> 10:26.750]  Blake Group looks like he is being forced to smile.
[10:26.910 --> 10:31.010]  And also, yeah, that's that's the picture when I was scrolling earlier and I started laughing.
[10:31.010 --> 10:33.190]  It's because I saw Blake Group for the Saints.
[10:33.370 --> 10:35.310]  That's a rough trade.
[10:35.410 --> 10:38.850]  Jake Bates looks like he is fresh out of high school.
[10:39.150 --> 10:42.610]  I like the energy. I like the he's got some good vibes.
[10:42.670 --> 10:47.110]  He looks like he is going to be the CW star of the next football show.
[10:47.110 --> 10:49.890]  So I'm going to go with the Lions and Jake Bates.
[10:50.350 --> 10:53.330]  Also, I think a line could kick a ball pretty far if it needed to.
[10:53.470 --> 10:56.010]  OK, so we're just going off vibes that there's no actual thought.
[10:56.130 --> 10:58.170]  Well, yeah, I'm going for he has doesn't have any kicks.
[10:58.770 --> 11:01.110]  Surely off vibes. OK, I like it.
[11:02.110 --> 11:04.870]  Dumb shit is next on the board, apparently.
[11:05.550 --> 11:10.130]  I have a. Hey, guys, dumb shit here.
[11:10.290 --> 11:10.990]  I have a question.
[11:12.790 --> 11:14.010]  I have a small question.
[11:14.010 --> 11:16.410]  So yeah, what is that?
[11:16.510 --> 11:17.990]  What are we doing? What is this?
[11:18.830 --> 11:20.950]  What are we doing? What are you talking about?
[11:21.930 --> 11:23.770]  So what is everyone talking about?
[11:24.030 --> 11:25.230]  It's a kicker picker.
[11:25.850 --> 11:27.870]  What do you mean it's a kicker picker? What am I doing?
[11:28.630 --> 11:30.630]  I got you to confirm the scoring.
[11:31.810 --> 11:35.510]  Yeah. And then I said, whoever gets the most points
[11:35.510 --> 11:38.530]  via via kicks going through wins.
[11:39.010 --> 11:40.570]  So here's what's going to happen, Gavin.
[11:40.670 --> 11:41.770]  These are all the kickers.
[11:41.770 --> 11:44.890]  This is the this is the kicker for every team in the NFL.
[11:45.170 --> 11:48.990]  I explain that we're all picking our our six kickers.
[11:49.070 --> 11:51.610]  I think we're going to watch the entire season
[11:51.610 --> 11:55.030]  and every point they make will count to us.
[11:55.050 --> 11:57.630]  Then at the end, whoever has the most points wins.
[11:58.090 --> 12:00.230]  I explain that he did. He explained it all.
[12:00.250 --> 12:02.610]  I'm just reiterating. Does that make sense?
[12:04.110 --> 12:06.990]  Yeah. When do they when do they kick off to the touchdown?
[12:07.510 --> 12:09.370]  Yeah. Or if they kick a field goal.
[12:09.370 --> 12:11.670]  Yeah. It's either we'll count extra points.
[12:11.990 --> 12:13.630]  So whenever they score a touchdown, they kick.
[12:14.070 --> 12:17.030]  And if they're like, oh, we're close, but we can't.
[12:17.410 --> 12:18.790]  We're not going to make it. They kick.
[12:19.370 --> 12:20.830]  Do P.A.T.s count the same?
[12:21.250 --> 12:22.910]  No. That's what I want to do.
[12:23.730 --> 12:25.270]  What do we do with P.A.T.s?
[12:25.930 --> 12:29.750]  Yeah, that's what Gavin's always concerned about the P.A.T.s.
[12:30.010 --> 12:33.450]  Yeah. I assumed we were counting P.A.T.s, but we don't have to.
[12:33.510 --> 12:37.170]  We can just let's just do all the kicks, all the kicks that they're involved with.
[12:37.950 --> 12:39.950]  Anytime they score. Yeah.
[12:40.050 --> 12:42.990]  Yep. Eddie Pinero.
[12:43.590 --> 12:45.370]  Why you feeling Eddie Pinero, dumb shit?
[12:45.790 --> 12:48.130]  What what number? What team is he on?
[12:48.370 --> 12:49.250]  Who's Eddie Pinero?
[12:50.150 --> 12:53.470]  Panthers. I had Pinero bread yesterday for lunch.
[12:54.210 --> 12:59.770]  OK. Eddie Pinero, you're on there.
[13:00.130 --> 13:01.910]  You got it. I love it.
[13:01.950 --> 13:02.990]  Gavin, it's your turn again.
[13:03.470 --> 13:06.230]  Yeah. What did you eat for lunch the previous day?
[13:07.870 --> 13:09.710]  Oh, I don't remember.
[13:10.450 --> 13:12.150]  But there's a GoPro on my desk.
[13:12.330 --> 13:13.970]  That's a little camera. Cam Little.
[13:14.450 --> 13:17.250]  Wow. Oh, you took Cam Little out from under me.
[13:17.650 --> 13:20.450]  Cam Little. Damn. I love the Cam Little pick.
[13:20.690 --> 13:22.210]  Yeah, that's a good that's a pretty good pick.
[13:23.130 --> 13:26.850]  And then what what you're going to want to do is when you pick someone,
[13:27.050 --> 13:28.750]  you want to let us know what team they're on.
[13:28.790 --> 13:30.810]  So you say Jaguars, Cam Little.
[13:30.830 --> 13:34.050]  Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't say Jaguars because that's not what that says.
[13:34.330 --> 13:37.150]  But what would you what would you say?
[13:38.190 --> 13:40.310]  Oh, Jaguar, you mean? The Jaguar?
[13:41.230 --> 13:43.150]  Jaguar. Jaguar. OK.
[13:43.570 --> 13:45.710]  Yeah, well, that's exactly how it's spelt.
[13:46.270 --> 13:48.810]  Oh, is that is that the way this language works?
[13:52.690 --> 13:53.970]  Here's a word, Gugment.
[14:04.230 --> 14:05.570]  Well, Jeff, you've been away.
[14:06.970 --> 14:09.130]  Gugment's had me in a real moody tooty.
[14:09.830 --> 14:13.390]  So my pick, I'm going to go with the 49ers Jake Moody.
[14:13.750 --> 14:15.530]  Damn it. Fuck. That was going to be my pick.
[14:15.650 --> 14:17.370]  I think that's a I think that's a really strong pick.
[14:17.930 --> 14:20.970]  He looks like an approachable dude in a country bar.
[14:21.590 --> 14:23.390]  Yeah, I think that's I think that's pretty good.
[14:23.490 --> 14:25.850]  Are you you filling out that D column there, bud, or what?
[14:26.530 --> 14:28.990]  I sure can. I felt like you hopped in.
[14:29.030 --> 14:30.070]  So then I backed off.
[14:30.130 --> 14:31.350]  I'm I'm taking care.
[14:31.430 --> 14:33.770]  I'm taking care of what's going on in the main board.
[14:33.770 --> 14:38.150]  Got it. OK, uh, OK, it's my turn.
[14:38.490 --> 14:39.230]  Yeah, I'm Jeff.
[14:41.110 --> 14:42.810]  I'm pretty excited about this one.
[14:43.010 --> 14:45.890]  I think it's going to be a good year for the Indianapolis Colts.
[14:46.590 --> 14:48.290]  They have a great kicker.
[14:49.150 --> 14:51.550]  Great name. Matt Gay.
[14:52.550 --> 14:53.510]  Very interesting.
[14:54.170 --> 14:55.050]  Interesting. Very good kicker.
[14:55.350 --> 14:57.390]  Very good team. Very on the on the rise.
[14:57.470 --> 14:58.670]  That team. Yeah.
[14:58.710 --> 15:02.130]  In twenty twenty two, he hit ninety three point three percent of his field goals.
[15:02.630 --> 15:04.950]  Yeah, he did it the gay way, as they say.
[15:05.190 --> 15:09.110]  Well, if we're going by if we're going by great names,
[15:09.110 --> 15:10.870]  I think you've chosen a great one.
[15:11.150 --> 15:15.990]  I'm unfortunately having to go with my former team, the Los Angeles Chargers.
[15:16.890 --> 15:20.830]  And if you're talking kickers, you better be talking dickers.
[15:21.030 --> 15:23.510]  Cameron Dicker is my pick.
[15:23.590 --> 15:27.150]  The dicker kicker is my picker to win this whole thing.
[15:27.430 --> 15:29.370]  Nicknamed Dicker the kicker. No joke.
[15:30.270 --> 15:31.930]  That's I don't know that it's a nickname.
[15:31.930 --> 15:34.850]  So much as it is a name and a description of his job.
[15:35.170 --> 15:37.150]  It was his nickname at UT.
[15:38.150 --> 15:39.390]  Oh, is that where he kicked?
[15:39.650 --> 15:41.610]  Yeah. So I took him.
[15:41.950 --> 15:42.830]  Yeah, I know. I saw.
[15:43.010 --> 15:45.250]  Yeah, I think I think Nick's a little annoyed.
[15:46.270 --> 15:48.710]  I took a cowboy and I took the UT guy.
[15:48.790 --> 15:49.630]  That's pretty cool.
[15:49.730 --> 15:51.490]  Yeah, you're next in a Jake booty.
[15:55.650 --> 15:57.430]  A dumb shit that was pretty good.
[15:57.430 --> 15:58.670]  That's funny.
[15:59.210 --> 16:00.110]  That's pissing me off.
[16:00.570 --> 16:02.790]  That made me that made me laugh.
[16:02.870 --> 16:05.270]  So I'm going with Chase McLaughlin.
[16:05.450 --> 16:07.210]  That's McLaughlin for the bucks.
[16:08.150 --> 16:08.510]  Good joke.
[16:08.630 --> 16:10.310]  Doesn't even it's not even a spelt laugh.
[16:10.470 --> 16:12.250]  No, it's no, no, no.
[16:12.470 --> 16:14.590]  He took that name and tried to make it clay.
[16:14.890 --> 16:16.670]  According to Gavin, that would be Lauchlin.
[16:19.750 --> 16:20.230]  Lauchlin.
[16:21.190 --> 16:21.710]  Lauchlin.
[16:25.970 --> 16:27.010]  Oh, man.
[16:27.490 --> 16:29.190]  Back on the board, Nick.
[16:29.510 --> 16:30.530]  Nick, you got it again.
[16:33.410 --> 16:38.650]  Uh, you know, I'm going to go with Graham Gano from the Giants.
[16:39.290 --> 16:40.950]  Damn it. I was going to pick that.
[16:42.230 --> 16:44.470]  Oh, because it's three G's.
[16:44.930 --> 16:46.710]  It is. Oh, he's triple G.
[16:47.030 --> 16:48.630]  Oh, guys, grocery games.
[16:49.670 --> 16:52.050]  That's what you think of when you hear triple G.
[16:52.250 --> 16:52.990]  Yes, with the nickname.
[16:54.230 --> 16:56.370]  Uh, we talked about how this was
[16:56.870 --> 17:00.330]  a pool of a lot of similar looking dudes and I'm going the other way.
[17:02.410 --> 17:04.230]  Young Hoku from the Falcons.
[17:04.490 --> 17:06.090]  He's good. He's my guy.
[17:06.210 --> 17:09.370]  I think I think the Falcons again, I'm trying to pick teams
[17:09.370 --> 17:12.250]  that are not making it to the end zone.
[17:12.490 --> 17:16.150]  So from about 26 yards out, they're going to have to settle for three.
[17:16.250 --> 17:17.770]  I'm feeling good about my pick so far.
[17:18.630 --> 17:19.770]  That's a good one.
[17:19.890 --> 17:21.530]  Uh, all right, it's my turn.
[17:21.870 --> 17:25.050]  I'm going to give some real football analysis here.
[17:25.130 --> 17:30.410]  I think the Pittsburgh Steelers are going to have a fun season of watching a
[17:31.110 --> 17:32.570]  Justin Fields head
[17:34.690 --> 17:40.190]  and Russell Wilson fight over who can be the most mid quarterback in the NFL.
[17:40.330 --> 17:43.670]  And so I think they're going to have to rely pretty heavily on Chris Boswell
[17:43.670 --> 17:44.350]  for points.
[17:44.710 --> 17:47.590]  You see a lot of field goals for the Steelers kicker.
[17:48.010 --> 17:51.670]  Yeah, I think I think that's probably a pretty safe.
[17:52.010 --> 17:53.270]  It's a pretty safe one.
[17:54.590 --> 17:56.370]  They are not making the end zone very much.
[17:56.490 --> 17:57.350]  It's going to be pretty exciting.
[17:57.910 --> 17:58.750]  Yeah. Yeah.
[17:58.790 --> 18:00.830]  I do think they're going to do the Russell Wilson thing where it's like
[18:00.830 --> 18:03.710]  how many games does it take for him to throw as many touchdowns
[18:03.710 --> 18:05.310]  as he has bathrooms in his house again?
[18:06.850 --> 18:08.270]  I didn't see that last time.
[18:08.650 --> 18:09.690]  Oh, really? Oh, yeah.
[18:09.710 --> 18:12.710]  It was like, how long does it take before he gets to nine touchdowns?
[18:12.710 --> 18:14.510]  The number of bathrooms he has in his home?
[18:15.830 --> 18:16.830]  Took a long time.
[18:16.830 --> 18:17.970]  Took a long time.
[18:17.970 --> 18:20.810]  Do you think if you had nine bathrooms in your house,
[18:20.850 --> 18:23.590]  you'd make it a point to shit in every one quickly?
[18:24.190 --> 18:26.250]  Yeah. No, I save one.
[18:26.330 --> 18:29.130]  Just be like, I want to leave one clean, pristine.
[18:29.770 --> 18:31.630]  Yeah. For like a special occasion.
[18:31.730 --> 18:33.410]  They don't stay good, though.
[18:33.930 --> 18:35.250]  No, Gavin's right.
[18:35.390 --> 18:37.850]  Like, I definitely think it's an issue.
[18:38.030 --> 18:40.190]  Yeah. What do you mean they don't stay good?
[18:40.430 --> 18:44.610]  Like if you if you have a bog that's not used, the water evaporates out.
[18:45.030 --> 18:46.690]  Yeah, the water will leave it.
[18:46.970 --> 18:49.050]  Oh, no, really? Yeah, yeah, it's bad.
[18:49.370 --> 18:50.210]  Keep them flushed.
[18:50.410 --> 18:51.830]  That's how Russell Wilson stays fit.
[18:52.390 --> 18:54.110]  Yeah, that's how that's his workout routine.
[18:54.110 --> 18:55.610]  He just runs up and down the stairs.
[18:56.430 --> 18:57.530]  Drills flushing toilets.
[18:58.030 --> 19:00.130]  Yeah, that's why he's fucking sucks.
[19:05.280 --> 19:08.380]  Why are there ridges on Risa's peanut butter cups?
[19:08.700 --> 19:10.460]  Probably so they never slip from her hands.
[19:10.800 --> 19:12.240]  Could you imagine I'd lose it?
[19:12.800 --> 19:14.580]  Luckily, Risa's thought about that.
[19:15.040 --> 19:16.380]  Wonder what else they think about?
[19:16.820 --> 19:19.120]  Probably chocolate and peanut butter.
[19:20.540 --> 19:24.060]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[19:24.400 --> 19:27.860]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love, now topped
[19:27.860 --> 19:30.980]  with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[19:31.320 --> 19:32.840]  Available for a limited time.
[19:33.080 --> 19:35.140]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[19:36.160 --> 19:37.160]  Hey, it's Paris.
[19:37.580 --> 19:39.740]  You know, I love sparkly things, right?
[19:39.960 --> 19:41.500]  Like stars. Duh.
[19:42.020 --> 19:43.720]  And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp,
[19:43.720 --> 19:45.660]  I just slept under them.
[19:46.360 --> 19:50.520]  Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream,
[19:51.020 --> 19:55.240]  making s'mores with the kids, while a national park is our backdrop.
[19:55.940 --> 19:58.280]  The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.
[19:58.800 --> 19:59.520]  That's hot.
[20:00.160 --> 20:03.200]  Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com.
[20:03.540 --> 20:04.920]  Hilton for the stay.
[20:05.500 --> 20:06.840]  But now it's Andrew's pick.
[20:07.180 --> 20:11.100]  Oh, man, there's so many good names still on the board.
[20:11.100 --> 20:11.460]  So many.
[20:11.760 --> 20:14.080]  And when I say good names, I mean literally good names.
[20:14.440 --> 20:15.920]  Yeah, you know, bass fishing.
[20:18.140 --> 20:19.660]  Uh, how do I want to?
[20:20.560 --> 20:21.420]  You know what?
[20:22.500 --> 20:26.220]  Uh, I'm going to go with Cade York because he just looks happy to be here.
[20:26.840 --> 20:29.000]  I think the commanders are not going to command themselves
[20:29.000 --> 20:30.620]  into the end zone all that often.
[20:32.580 --> 20:36.480]  And he just he has a he's got a chill vibe to him.
[20:36.820 --> 20:38.260]  OK, got the mustache.
[20:38.940 --> 20:40.880]  Looks like a wacky sheriff almost.
[20:41.700 --> 20:43.080]  I'm liking Cade York.
[20:43.360 --> 20:47.220]  I guess he looks like the deputy who gets shot.
[20:48.200 --> 20:50.280]  He does. Yeah, he lives, though.
[20:50.460 --> 20:52.800]  But he ends up he gets shot in the in the shoulder.
[20:53.000 --> 20:56.160]  Yeah. Oh, Sheriff, we got to stop him.
[20:56.460 --> 20:59.900]  At the end of the movie, he's he's got a sling and you're like, Oh, thank God.
[21:00.280 --> 21:01.540]  I live. That's cool.
[21:01.580 --> 21:03.640]  They shot him in the gut, but he has a sling. That's cool.
[21:04.120 --> 21:07.900]  Uh, Gavin, I know you're really locked in on this.
[21:08.260 --> 21:09.500]  Oh, locked all the way in.
[21:09.740 --> 21:10.580]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[21:10.580 --> 21:12.880]  But now it's time for you to make your next two picks.
[21:13.080 --> 21:15.620]  I'm now looking at, you know, who's been picked so far.
[21:15.660 --> 21:17.960]  And we've got some, you know, some childish giggle names.
[21:18.080 --> 21:19.460]  We've got Gay and Dicker.
[21:19.560 --> 21:22.100]  And I thought, let me find one of those right in between.
[21:22.260 --> 21:24.620]  We've got Harrison Butker. Oh,
[21:26.240 --> 21:27.720]  you do. You do.
[21:27.820 --> 21:29.820]  The Chiefs. That's pretty good.
[21:30.160 --> 21:34.220]  And and it could be death by a thousand cuts because it's going to
[21:34.220 --> 21:37.660]  they're going to get he's going to get a lot of a point after.
[21:37.660 --> 21:40.660]  Yeah. One here and there, like over and over and over again.
[21:41.020 --> 21:42.300]  So it's
[21:43.160 --> 21:43.780]  excuse me.
[21:44.580 --> 21:44.980]  Interesting.
[21:46.880 --> 21:49.080]  So I've been gone for what?
[21:49.100 --> 21:50.460]  Fucking two weeks or something. Yeah.
[21:50.660 --> 21:52.660]  Yeah. I've been sick the entire time.
[21:52.920 --> 21:55.260]  Oh, yeah. Pretty much.
[21:55.360 --> 21:55.780]  Yeah, I know.
[21:56.260 --> 21:59.240]  I guess I picked up something in Detroit and I've been trying to get rid of it.
[21:59.300 --> 22:01.120]  But no. Hey, hey, you know what?
[22:01.120 --> 22:03.220]  At least you're back and you just get to relax now, man.
[22:03.280 --> 22:05.980]  Yeah. Until like I'm on a plane at noon tomorrow.
[22:06.240 --> 22:07.280]  Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22:07.920 --> 22:09.280]  Gavin, have fun with that.
[22:09.380 --> 22:12.880]  But pick he's he's been in the news a bit lately.
[22:12.920 --> 22:16.040]  Oh, yeah. And so for real ass in the offseason.
[22:16.520 --> 22:18.760]  I mean, surely for good things. Right, Jeff?
[22:19.480 --> 22:23.620]  Yeah. He gave a speech at a I believe it was at a college
[22:23.620 --> 22:26.320]  graduation that ruffled a few feathers.
[22:26.580 --> 22:29.560]  Oh, well, what's he done?
[22:29.580 --> 22:31.500]  You didn't know about that? No.
[22:32.240 --> 22:35.400]  I mean, I expect Gavin to be on top of NFL news.
[22:35.400 --> 22:39.400]  It's sort of a sort of a women belong in the kitchen
[22:39.400 --> 22:42.680]  and not at college is learning kind of vibe.
[22:42.680 --> 22:44.140]  Yeah, I thought you'd like this.
[22:44.460 --> 22:48.620]  Real, real big in the in the MAGA movement.
[22:48.840 --> 22:50.220]  I hear. Oh, yeah.
[22:50.380 --> 22:53.120]  Do you not? I thought this was like your boy right here, dude.
[22:54.220 --> 22:56.220]  I'm immediately going to distance myself from the boy.
[22:56.360 --> 22:59.220]  He's the right pick, obviously, because of a funny name.
[23:00.700 --> 23:02.540]  I'll say this. He's a really good kicker.
[23:02.920 --> 23:05.180]  I look at him. He is elite. God damn it.
[23:05.400 --> 23:08.780]  I skipped over him, but yeah, I forgot about that.
[23:08.860 --> 23:09.620]  Thanks for taking him, Gavin.
[23:09.880 --> 23:13.020]  Yeah, we I think everybody appreciates you taking a bullet there.
[23:13.400 --> 23:19.620]  This name's it's messing with my brain because it's almost entirely Ray Narvaez.
[23:19.880 --> 23:23.600]  But it isn't. It's Brayden Narveson.
[23:23.940 --> 23:25.640]  A lot of the letters are in there.
[23:26.080 --> 23:27.840]  And he looks exactly like Ray.
[23:29.420 --> 23:32.260]  Yeah, you think he looks exactly like Ray?
[23:32.560 --> 23:34.740]  You think that's what Ray looks like?
[23:36.800 --> 23:37.200]  Twins.
[23:38.440 --> 23:39.760]  Do you know about that?
[23:39.840 --> 23:41.500]  Do you know about that kicker that looks like Ray?
[23:42.220 --> 23:43.680]  Did he punch a woman or something?
[23:44.240 --> 23:45.620]  No. What? What?
[23:45.900 --> 23:48.340]  OK, I was just prepared for the worst.
[23:49.060 --> 23:51.020]  What? Whoa.
[23:51.140 --> 23:52.340]  Why would you say that?
[23:52.380 --> 23:54.880]  Well, after butt kiss or whatever, who'd I ask for a butt kiss?
[23:54.980 --> 23:57.340]  That's you, dude. I don't know what you're like.
[23:57.420 --> 23:59.500]  What what are you talking about?
[24:00.880 --> 24:02.020]  Oh, I'm learning.
[24:02.200 --> 24:03.500]  What did he what did this guy do?
[24:03.960 --> 24:05.600]  Nothing. What did he do?
[24:06.580 --> 24:10.460]  Anything? It's just that this is a this is the NFL kicker that looks like Ray.
[24:10.680 --> 24:11.800]  Well, he's got the wrong name.
[24:12.300 --> 24:13.100]  That's true.
[24:13.500 --> 24:14.940]  Rod, the kicker three.
[24:15.100 --> 24:17.220]  And I don't think he I don't know if he's even in the league anymore.
[24:17.240 --> 24:19.980]  He does look a little bit like Ray, though, doesn't he?
[24:19.980 --> 24:23.140]  Yep. See, you think that's Ray photoshopped in there?
[24:23.240 --> 24:25.140]  It's not. That's just what the guy looks like.
[24:25.240 --> 24:25.900]  That's incredible.
[24:26.500 --> 24:27.260]  Yeah. Isn't that crazy?
[24:27.640 --> 24:28.200]  Isn't that weird?
[24:29.380 --> 24:30.180]  Oh, wow.
[24:30.880 --> 24:32.080]  Why can't we pick him?
[24:32.880 --> 24:34.160]  Yeah, he's not in the league.
[24:34.600 --> 24:35.260]  Yeah, I don't know.
[24:35.340 --> 24:37.340]  He might be in the league, but he's not on this list.
[24:37.440 --> 24:41.080]  Ah, but Andrew, it's time for you to make your pick from who's on this list.
[24:41.140 --> 24:42.140]  Oh, shit. It's my turn.
[24:43.240 --> 24:44.740]  That's how this thing has worked so far.
[24:44.800 --> 24:47.100]  Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen, I was caught up in Gavin
[24:48.880 --> 24:50.480]  not knowing who Ray is.
[24:54.200 --> 24:55.960]  It's weird because they kind of work together.
[24:56.260 --> 24:57.460]  They're not very long, though.
[24:57.500 --> 24:59.320]  It's not nearly as long as everybody remembers.
[24:59.520 --> 25:00.700]  No, that's true. It's fair.
[25:01.260 --> 25:06.100]  I think I'm going to go with some Mario Cardi, Joshua Cardi with the ramps.
[25:06.120 --> 25:07.620]  Twenty five. He looks happy.
[25:07.920 --> 25:10.040]  I'm going with a good vibe squad.
[25:10.800 --> 25:11.780]  Joshua Cardi.
[25:12.440 --> 25:13.840]  He's got a big smile.
[25:14.380 --> 25:16.680]  He does. He also has the name.
[25:16.800 --> 25:19.160]  I can't tell if he's got like the little chin goatee thing,
[25:19.280 --> 25:20.940]  but maybe it's just a shadow.
[25:21.080 --> 25:21.640]  It's a shadow.
[25:22.480 --> 25:25.800]  Yeah. Kind of looks like Andy from Toy Story growing up.
[25:26.980 --> 25:30.700]  Yeah, about about as much as Brayden, nervous and looks like Ray.
[25:30.800 --> 25:33.520]  Yeah, no, I think my comparable is a lot better than that.
[25:35.080 --> 25:36.020]  Whatever you say, man.
[25:36.700 --> 25:41.060]  It is. Jeff, I'm going to go with a completely boring
[25:41.980 --> 25:44.220]  non-controversial or funny pick in any way.
[25:44.480 --> 25:45.620]  Jake Elliott for the Eagles.
[25:46.060 --> 25:48.800]  OK, go Eagles. He's going to get a lot of action. Yeah.
[25:49.760 --> 25:52.060]  I think I think you're probably right.
[25:52.060 --> 25:56.660]  Uh, I'm going with the Bears.
[25:57.440 --> 25:58.320]  Cairo Santos.
[25:58.560 --> 26:01.320]  I don't really have much of a reason.
[26:01.580 --> 26:02.860]  I think it's a great name.
[26:03.080 --> 26:05.120]  I think the Bears are going to,
[26:06.180 --> 26:09.580]  you know, you got to pick you got to pick someone who's still on.
[26:09.700 --> 26:11.600]  Cam Little got chosen. So what am I supposed to do?
[26:11.660 --> 26:13.080]  I'm going to go with Cairo Santos.
[26:14.040 --> 26:14.980]  Nick, you got two.
[26:15.640 --> 26:17.580]  You know, I'm going to go with,
[26:18.360 --> 26:21.060]  I think from the Cardinals, Matt Prater,
[26:21.660 --> 26:25.260]  because I don't know that they're going to hit the end zone a lot.
[26:25.380 --> 26:27.760]  But if they do, at least I'll get the PATs then.
[26:28.820 --> 26:29.900]  Old as fuck, Matt Prater.
[26:30.040 --> 26:30.720]  I think he's 43.
[26:31.420 --> 26:32.380]  He's got a lot of experience.
[26:32.660 --> 26:33.860]  481 kicks already.
[26:34.240 --> 26:36.480]  So yeah, it's a really nice way of saying old.
[26:36.840 --> 26:38.660]  Well, he's got some mileage.
[26:38.800 --> 26:39.540]  How about that?
[26:41.240 --> 26:42.800]  And then I'm going to go with
[26:46.120 --> 26:46.840]  the Browns.
[26:47.520 --> 26:48.680]  I have a feeling we keep going.
[26:48.920 --> 26:49.860]  How many we do it?
[26:49.860 --> 26:50.520]  Six!
[26:50.700 --> 26:50.920]  Six!
[26:51.500 --> 26:52.360]  I've got to explain this!
[26:52.600 --> 26:52.960]  It was over!
[26:56.880 --> 26:58.940]  You've got to pick two more times, asshole.
[27:00.020 --> 27:00.900]  Good deal, Michael.
[27:01.040 --> 27:03.280]  I think the Browns are going to be a shit show,
[27:03.460 --> 27:05.340]  but I think they're going to be on field goal range.
[27:05.500 --> 27:06.340]  Lucas, have a risk.
[27:06.640 --> 27:07.180]  Have a risk?
[27:07.180 --> 27:07.360]  OK.
[27:08.720 --> 27:09.540]  We'll see how they do.
[27:09.540 --> 27:10.500]  I think you nailed it.
[27:10.520 --> 27:10.720]  Yeah.
[27:11.120 --> 27:11.880]  I think that's great.
[27:12.100 --> 27:12.740]  I'm feeling confident.
[27:13.580 --> 27:14.320]  Loving my team.
[27:15.280 --> 27:17.080]  Now it's back to me.
[27:17.600 --> 27:19.840]  And I think, man,
[27:21.140 --> 27:22.100]  how about
[27:23.680 --> 27:26.180]  Jason Sanders for the Dolphins?
[27:26.400 --> 27:28.880]  Nothing funny about that pick,
[27:29.000 --> 27:32.660]  but if they score a lot of touchdowns, he'll give me some numbers.
[27:32.660 --> 27:35.440]  But if they're just in the range and they can't quite get there,
[27:35.500 --> 27:37.740]  I think he's going to be a guy that you see a lot of.
[27:39.760 --> 27:40.980]  Oh, man.
[27:41.300 --> 27:41.760]  Jeff.
[27:42.560 --> 27:44.860]  Uh, I'm going to pick Seahawks.
[27:45.400 --> 27:46.740]  Should be Jason Myers.
[27:46.960 --> 27:47.240]  No!
[27:48.460 --> 27:51.000]  Two time Pro Bowl for Jason Myers.
[27:51.820 --> 27:52.620]  My pick.
[27:52.720 --> 27:53.500]  Feel pretty good about that.
[27:53.620 --> 27:54.260]  Yeah. Thank you.
[27:54.740 --> 27:55.280]  There he goes.
[27:55.400 --> 27:57.420]  He's got a serial killer last name and first name.
[27:57.880 --> 27:58.840]  This is a quarter killer.
[27:59.140 --> 27:59.560]  Halloween.
[28:00.160 --> 28:01.080]  He's unstoppable.
[28:01.960 --> 28:03.040]  Andrew, who are you thinking?
[28:04.080 --> 28:06.200]  Oh, this is really tough because there's
[28:06.760 --> 28:08.840]  there's an important thing in this that you need to consider
[28:09.420 --> 28:11.620]  of I'm going to be yelling potentially.
[28:11.680 --> 28:14.000]  I need somebody's name that is fun to just yell.
[28:14.500 --> 28:14.740]  Yeah.
[28:15.040 --> 28:16.080]  Disappoint me or excite me.
[28:16.080 --> 28:17.280]  Probably disappoint me.
[28:17.940 --> 28:21.300]  I'm trying to decide if it's more fun to yell Lutz or group.
[28:22.320 --> 28:23.200]  It's tough.
[28:23.720 --> 28:25.520]  Well, you know, you have two picks.
[28:25.660 --> 28:27.880]  You can get them both in there.
[28:27.980 --> 28:30.260]  I'm not a swing fourth.
[28:31.360 --> 28:34.260]  Uh, so I have two picks remaining.
[28:34.360 --> 28:34.880]  That's true.
[28:34.940 --> 28:37.160]  But I'm going to go with Lutz.
[28:40.240 --> 28:43.400]  Like, is what I said confusing in any way?
[28:43.460 --> 28:46.020]  No, I just was clarifying that, you know, I don't have a guarantee.
[28:46.020 --> 28:47.160]  He'd lock them up.
[28:47.160 --> 28:49.560]  Gavin could swoop in and take some group.
[28:51.120 --> 28:53.780]  You know, I really like the look of Blake group.
[28:54.280 --> 28:56.320]  Yeah, you son of a bitch!
[28:57.440 --> 28:58.920]  He plays for the Saints.
[28:59.560 --> 29:00.100]  He does.
[29:00.220 --> 29:01.520]  He does play for the Saints.
[29:02.040 --> 29:03.100]  And he is Blake group.
[29:03.420 --> 29:04.720]  What a great pick, Gavin.
[29:04.820 --> 29:05.680]  That's really smart.
[29:08.300 --> 29:10.120]  Why else is fun to yell?
[29:10.700 --> 29:11.900]  Uh huh. You've one more.
[29:11.980 --> 29:12.580]  You got one more.
[29:13.240 --> 29:13.560]  Oh, yeah.
[29:15.660 --> 29:16.540]  Nick Folk.
[29:17.300 --> 29:19.000]  Oh, what's he on?
[29:19.500 --> 29:19.880]  The Titans.
[29:20.340 --> 29:21.520]  Titans, the Titans.
[29:21.820 --> 29:23.960]  Look at his big, big jaw.
[29:25.080 --> 29:27.380]  Nick, Discord kind of like cut out when you sat.
[29:27.580 --> 29:29.600]  It's so sort of sounded like you said, Nick, fuck.
[29:29.860 --> 29:32.700]  You're picking Nick fuck for the Titans.
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.320]  OK, Gavin's got all of his kickers locked up.
[29:36.440 --> 29:39.600]  Now it's time for Andrew to finally make his last pick.
[29:39.700 --> 29:42.100]  And you can't take groups off the list, dude.
[29:43.560 --> 29:45.120]  I don't like the look of Chad Ryland.
[29:45.320 --> 29:45.940]  Just personally.
[29:46.320 --> 29:48.820]  OK, opinion. OK, I get it.
[29:50.300 --> 29:54.720]  Oh, man, so a lot of kickers here that you can feel pretty good about. Yeah.
[29:55.760 --> 29:57.320]  You know, I'm going to I'm going to go.
[29:57.420 --> 29:58.760]  I'm going to do some bass fishing.
[29:59.100 --> 30:00.440]  I'm taking that Tyler Bass.
[30:00.900 --> 30:02.500]  Damn, that was going to be my pick, man.
[30:02.540 --> 30:04.680]  That's a good I think that's going to be a good like me.
[30:04.880 --> 30:06.420]  Tyler Bass. Yeah.
[30:06.900 --> 30:08.300]  Yeah, I think that's going to be pretty good.
[30:09.980 --> 30:11.740]  How about you, Jeff?
[30:11.740 --> 30:14.260]  Oh, my God. Can I see who's left?
[30:14.320 --> 30:15.500]  I got Evan McPherson.
[30:16.100 --> 30:20.340]  Yep. You also have here's Austin Seabert.
[30:20.340 --> 30:21.320]  Austin Seabert.
[30:22.540 --> 30:24.340]  Or Chad Ryland.
[30:25.480 --> 30:26.680]  Chad Ryland.
[30:28.180 --> 30:30.720]  Kaimi Fairburn, yeah, Fairburn.
[30:30.900 --> 30:36.440]  And Will Reichardt, who is brand new and might die first, I'm not sure.
[30:37.860 --> 30:39.020]  That's tough, dude.
[30:39.100 --> 30:40.180]  Here's what I'm going to go with.
[30:40.180 --> 30:43.940]  I'm going to go with these are all fucking quarterback heavy teams.
[30:44.080 --> 30:48.760]  I'm going to go with Evan McPherson with the Bengals,
[30:48.800 --> 30:51.740]  because I think there's a pretty good chance that Joe Burrow gets hurt.
[30:51.840 --> 30:53.060]  I think he might be glass.
[30:53.380 --> 30:55.980]  And so they may have to they may have to.
[30:56.020 --> 30:58.540]  Yeah, I feel lean heavily on their kickers.
[31:00.400 --> 31:05.960]  I am going to grab Kaimi Fairburn from the Texans.
[31:06.440 --> 31:08.460]  Don't know who he is. Never heard of him.
[31:08.460 --> 31:10.300]  Don't care much for the Texans.
[31:10.380 --> 31:14.460]  But I'm going to lock him up and see if he brings me in those points.
[31:14.680 --> 31:18.260]  And Nick, with the final pick of the kicker picker draft.
[31:18.620 --> 31:20.080]  Well, I'm going with the guy who's going to die first.
[31:20.200 --> 31:21.620]  That's Will Reichardt from the Vikings.
[31:21.820 --> 31:22.700]  They play indoors.
[31:23.260 --> 31:26.140]  I don't like their offense, so I think they're going to have to settle
[31:26.140 --> 31:26.940]  for field goals a lot.
[31:27.060 --> 31:28.420]  And they play like I said, they play inside.
[31:28.540 --> 31:30.780]  So it should be easier for a rookie to get some kicks.
[31:31.400 --> 31:33.360]  So I'm not going to go through who we've all picked.
[31:33.420 --> 31:35.660]  I think this is a pretty it's pretty like locked in.
[31:35.660 --> 31:39.820]  But I will point out that we did not pick the Jets,
[31:40.100 --> 31:43.960]  Austin Siebert or the Patriots, Chad Riley.
[31:44.180 --> 31:44.620]  Same division.
[31:45.220 --> 31:48.120]  Those are the two and they are.
[31:49.240 --> 31:53.960]  Here's the thing. Bad teams that are like notorious for falling apart.
[31:54.140 --> 31:56.960]  And those guys could be guys that you really hang it on this year.
[31:57.700 --> 32:00.420]  This might be the worst Patriots team in 20 years.
[32:00.620 --> 32:02.480]  Oh, isn't it awesome? It's the best.
[32:02.580 --> 32:04.880]  It's so fun to watch. God, it rocks.
[32:04.880 --> 32:09.400]  Chad Ryland looks like he was made in a lab to be the Patriots kicker.
[32:09.720 --> 32:15.460]  Dude, if that if that guy's not from Boston, he's going to fit right in.
[32:15.620 --> 32:18.140]  It looks like Mac Jones in disguise.
[32:19.860 --> 32:21.960]  I'm still useful. I'm going to kick that.
[32:22.620 --> 32:25.440]  Mac, you're going to shake everyone and just be like, you motherfuckers.
[32:25.500 --> 32:27.000]  You should have cut me. I'm back.
[32:27.660 --> 32:30.580]  I will say this respectfully about Austin Siebert.
[32:30.840 --> 32:34.020]  He looks like he is being used to promote
[32:34.020 --> 32:37.080]  that hair powder thing that we got for does it do?
[32:37.660 --> 32:39.980]  That is what the profile image looks like to me.
[32:40.240 --> 32:42.200]  Like he is a successful user.
[32:44.060 --> 32:45.380]  Those are our last two.
[32:45.720 --> 32:49.040]  I will say, Nick, with your pick, you might be the first to die
[32:49.040 --> 32:51.840]  or he'll be the psycho that makes it to the end.
[32:51.900 --> 32:53.240]  And oh, wow. Yeah.
[32:53.600 --> 32:55.840]  So you get a lot of points there off that. I like that.
[32:56.460 --> 32:57.420]  I'm I feel confident.
[32:57.960 --> 33:00.900]  Speaking of that top pick thing, I forgot to mention to you guys
[33:00.900 --> 33:04.720]  when I was watching the Love Island UK season
[33:04.720 --> 33:06.740]  that I eventually bailed on to watch the U.S.
[33:06.760 --> 33:07.740]  because it was better this year.
[33:08.420 --> 33:10.260]  There was a dude who had kind of weird hair.
[33:10.520 --> 33:13.600]  And then I saw an interview with him later where he said like
[33:13.600 --> 33:15.960]  he put topic on his hair the entire time he was there.
[33:16.480 --> 33:18.000]  Really? And that's why it looked weird.
[33:18.080 --> 33:18.740]  Yeah, I saw that.
[33:19.120 --> 33:21.860]  I saw like, yeah, the production was really cool about it.
[33:21.860 --> 33:23.200]  They knew it was just like a thing I do.
[33:23.280 --> 33:25.900]  And like it was and I was like, fuck, that's the stuff we used.
[33:26.480 --> 33:28.680]  That works. You know, see it out in the wild.
[33:28.680 --> 33:29.800]  If it works, it works.
[33:30.040 --> 33:30.940]  How do you feel about your squad, Gavin?
[33:31.600 --> 33:32.320]  Oh, I'm going to win.
[33:32.660 --> 33:35.820]  All your research payoff? Yep. Locked in.
[33:36.400 --> 33:39.540]  Panthers, Jaguars, Chiefs, Packers, Saints and Titans.
[33:39.920 --> 33:40.540]  Not bad.
[33:41.840 --> 33:45.960]  Andrew's got Lions, 49ers, Commanders, Rams, Broncos, Bills.
[33:46.680 --> 33:47.800]  What are 49ers?
[33:48.820 --> 33:50.360]  What are 49ers? They're minors.
[33:50.480 --> 33:51.320]  Yeah, they're minors. Yeah.
[33:51.680 --> 33:52.400]  Oh, really? OK.
[33:52.740 --> 33:54.760]  Yeah, they were the California Gold Rush.
[33:55.460 --> 33:57.380]  Got it. Oh, I'm getting the gold.
[33:57.380 --> 33:59.740]  Oh, this ties back to the Olympics.
[34:00.160 --> 34:05.560]  Oh, Jeff, the Raiders, the Colts, the Steelers,
[34:06.020 --> 34:09.120]  the Eagles, the Seahawks and the Bengals.
[34:09.440 --> 34:12.920]  I've got the Cowboys, the Chargers, the Falcons, the Bears,
[34:13.180 --> 34:17.220]  the Dolphins, the Texans and Nick Ravens, Bucks,
[34:17.820 --> 34:20.660]  Giants, Cards, Browns, Vikings.
[34:20.820 --> 34:23.720]  I think they're a great, great disbursement all around from everyone.
[34:23.820 --> 34:26.100]  Very, very good for the kicker picker.
[34:26.100 --> 34:30.120]  Uh, Jeff is really close to going all animal.
[34:30.740 --> 34:32.720]  Oh, yeah. Whoa.
[34:33.300 --> 34:33.900]  It's too late.
[34:34.100 --> 34:37.120]  Well, I mean, the Raiders are like animals if you really look at them.
[34:41.100 --> 34:44.240]  You see the have you ever seen the super fan of the Raiders
[34:44.240 --> 34:45.940]  that dresses in the full gorilla suit?
[34:46.380 --> 34:48.180]  Oh, yeah. No, he's great.
[34:48.620 --> 34:49.300]  I love that guy.
[34:49.660 --> 34:51.800]  I they are man.
[34:52.100 --> 34:54.140]  They are a weird insane people.
[34:54.540 --> 34:55.180]  Yeah, they are.
[34:55.180 --> 34:56.740]  Yeah. I mean, they're Raiders fans.
[34:56.940 --> 34:58.340]  They're crazy to begin with.
[34:58.820 --> 35:04.060]  But like, man, they are truly an insane group.
[35:04.420 --> 35:05.840]  Now we need to make one.
[35:06.060 --> 35:07.560]  There we go. That's my guy.
[35:09.400 --> 35:10.620]  He's a super fan.
[35:11.080 --> 35:12.580]  Aren't you sad you didn't get this team, Gavin?
[35:14.080 --> 35:14.520]  Yeah.
[35:18.100 --> 35:18.980]  Now before
[35:20.200 --> 35:21.620]  we're fully locked in,
[35:21.740 --> 35:23.740]  we need to make a decision because we have two kickers left.
[35:24.240 --> 35:27.780]  If a kicker gets hurt, which is going to happen to one of us,
[35:27.780 --> 35:31.460]  are we able to swap them or are we just locked in with what we have?
[35:31.600 --> 35:33.660]  I think we have to be locked in because I agree.
[35:33.820 --> 35:36.580]  Like so much of like the kicker stuff is going to change.
[35:38.400 --> 35:41.440]  It like there are kickers on here that I didn't know
[35:41.440 --> 35:44.620]  that they were the kickers for their teams. Yeah.
[35:45.580 --> 35:50.800]  I was under the impression that the kicker for the Jets was Greg Zerlein.
[35:52.180 --> 35:54.500]  I went off their depth chart.
[35:54.940 --> 35:56.240]  I mean, it might be right.
[35:56.340 --> 36:00.200]  He might have gotten knocked way down and he might not be the kicker there anymore.
[36:00.440 --> 36:02.600]  Maybe he's not. I was just under the impression he still was.
[36:02.940 --> 36:03.500]  Maybe he's not anymore.
[36:04.020 --> 36:06.280]  I mean, I bought I bought a movie that didn't frickin come out.
[36:06.340 --> 36:07.720]  I think if you get into it,
[36:07.980 --> 36:11.160]  I got a couple of movies and it's a great point.
[36:11.300 --> 36:13.320]  I also think it's not by team.
[36:13.360 --> 36:18.160]  Like if if Matt Gay for the Colts is out and they bring someone else in,
[36:18.260 --> 36:19.200]  you don't get those points.
[36:19.200 --> 36:21.640]  You got Matt Gay points, baby. That's it. Yeah.
[36:22.340 --> 36:24.940]  You're betting on the durability of your kicker. Exactly.
[36:26.200 --> 36:28.460]  Tough affair. That is a great point.
[36:28.740 --> 36:32.100]  We'll say the Packers pulled a fast one, cut their kicker, brought in a new guy
[36:32.100 --> 36:34.740]  like eight hours ago as of yesterday.
[36:35.540 --> 36:37.040]  What? Really? Yeah.
[36:37.140 --> 36:39.680]  Like I made the full list and then yesterday
[36:41.020 --> 36:44.000]  during the middle of the day, they cut the guy that I put on the list.
[36:44.340 --> 36:45.360]  It was listed. Wow.
[36:46.880 --> 36:47.680]  Holy shit.
[36:48.720 --> 36:49.520]  That's crazy.
[36:50.220 --> 36:51.140]  Good luck, fellas.
[36:51.720 --> 36:52.340]  Yeah. No kidding.
[36:52.500 --> 36:54.260]  Oh, I'm excited to see how this all plays out.
[36:55.260 --> 36:57.620]  Thank you for watching this kicker picker draft.
[36:59.200 --> 37:01.900]  Somebody is going to make a website about this and keep track of
[37:02.520 --> 37:03.700]  how these scores go.
[37:03.780 --> 37:07.500]  Yeah, there will be updates in some fashion at some point in time in the future.
[37:07.940 --> 37:09.280]  Yeah. But now I'm excited.
[37:09.400 --> 37:10.720]  I got I got something to watch.
[37:10.780 --> 37:11.860]  I'm watching Red Zone, baby.
[37:11.880 --> 37:13.380]  I'm watching my boys. Hell yeah.
[37:14.060 --> 37:16.280]  NFL season starts next Thursday from this recording.
[37:16.280 --> 37:18.640]  So we are. What's the first game?
[37:20.260 --> 37:23.540]  It's Chiefs versus Ravens.
[37:23.720 --> 37:24.640]  Ravens. Oh, wow.
[37:24.660 --> 37:27.860]  It's a classic Nick versus Gavin matchup, guys.
[37:27.980 --> 37:30.540]  It is. It's the duo that you love.
[37:30.720 --> 37:34.980]  Gavin and Nick together again in head to head competition.
[37:35.560 --> 37:37.080]  Bring it on. It's a kickoff.
[37:37.280 --> 37:39.660]  Oh, I got you. It's a kickoff.
[37:41.990 --> 37:42.870]  It's a kickoff.
[37:44.170 --> 37:45.690]  Well, thanks for watching this.
[37:45.810 --> 37:47.230]  Let us know who you think is going to win.
[37:47.230 --> 37:48.650]  Let us know who you would have picked.
[37:49.010 --> 37:52.930]  Go to Patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[37:53.270 --> 37:56.090]  You can go subscribe there and see everything that we put up there.
[37:56.190 --> 37:58.090]  It's a lot more of this and a lot weirder stuff.
[37:58.370 --> 38:02.510]  So thanks for watching and we'll see you next time.
[38:03.430 --> 38:03.830]  Bye.
[38:05.350 --> 38:06.190]  All right. Can't believe it.
[38:06.350 --> 38:08.230]  Can't believe I picked this through the uprights.
